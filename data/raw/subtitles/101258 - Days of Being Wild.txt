my dream last night
Of course,

If you sleep!
You'll see me, for sure
You look really special today

You're with me
Because of you,
I'll remember that one minute
From now on,
we're friends of one minute
This is fact, you can't deny it
Cause it's past
I'll come tomorrow
Can he remember
that minute for me?
I don't know
But I've memorized this guy
Later on, he did come everyday
We became friends,
it started from that one minute
...to 2 minutes
Later, we dated at least
an hour a day
How long have we known each other?
Pretty long... I've forgoten
My cousin is going to
get married soon
Really? Send my regards to her
She said that. . .
she'd live with her husband's family
What's that mean?
I have to find someplace else to live
I'd like to live with you
So, how should I tell my dad?
Tell what?
Our affair!
What affair?
Will you marry me?
No!
I'll never come back
Didi, be quick, come over here
Your mother is drunk,
she is sick in the bathroom
I'm in a hurry
Get her a cup of tea
Are you hungry?
Do you want something to eat?
Who's that guy?
It's Only one pair of earrings,
here you can have it back
I think theres more you've stolen
I've told you already
that I never stole anything!
She gave it to me willingly
You mean she was willing
to pay for your living?
Your not getting away that easy?
Don't beat me...
Then?
Stop beating me!
What?
What? Say it out loud...
Louder!
I stole it!
Louder!
It's me, I stole it...
I don't want you to see
my mother again
you can change now
Have you seen any earrings?
No, but I can help you look
Hey, what are you doing here?
You like these earrings?
For you
Hey!
Why only one?
I'll be waiting for you downstairs
Who's place is this?
My home
I never promised to
go home with you
But you've never said "No"
Do you live alone?
How's the rent?
$40
Wow, my family lives in a room
for only $28
Do you always take girls home?
it depends
Let's make a deal,
I'll only stay awhile 
It's stuffy in here
Are there alot of families
living here?
it's empty?
You're nosy, aren't you?
Where's the bathroom?
Let's go & eat something
Why didn't you say soemthing earlier?
It's really coming down out there
I'd better leave now,
take me home
Why did you come home with me
then?
I just promised to stay awhile,
who do you think I am?
Don't think that
I'm that easy to sleep with
Don't think that you can
do anything you want
by giving me a pair of 
cheap earrings
I'm different from those
flapper girls!
Don't come over
Guess how long you can
stop breathing
Thief! Who's that?
It's me!
My friend
I've told you before
dont come up here
I don't want the Indian guard
to bother me
How would I know you have a girl up here,
I'll see ya later
Take the stairs
Where I come from, is where I go from
Your friend is wierd,
what is he?
Don't be nosy!
Is he a thief?
What time is it?
3 am
I've gotta go home now
Can I see you tomorrow?
Maybe
Well, call me
Do you have my phone number?
I'll write it down
Call after 11 ,
or I won't be there
Leung Fung-ying?
Aren't you called Lulu?
My colleagues don't know
my Christian name
promise you'll call, OK?
OK
I know you won't call me
I will
You won't even memorize
my number!
It's written down, why should I
keep this in my head?
How about if it gets lost?
if it's lost,
I maybe lost too
Go & lose it , if you dare!
If you lose it,
I will cut your face!
Stop saying that to me
You're great!
Where there's an illness,
there's a cure!
Are you going home?
I'll call you a cab
I don't want to go home now
Well, stay here then
Go to hell!
Good morning
Why are you still sitting here?
Why don't you go home?
You haven't gone home either
I'm not going to talk to you
Hey!
Have I ever met you before?
I don't think so
But, have you ever noticed me?
You know it pretty well
What's your job?
My job?
Please turn up the radio,
I cant hear it
Any idea? Got it?
Not yet
Dance once more for me OK?
Do you want to take
advantage of me?
Hey... What's your name?
Call me Mimi
I've heard that there was
a kind of bird with no legs
It could fly and only fly...
When it got tired,
it slept in the wind
This kind of bird
could only land once
That was the time it died
Auntie
Come here, I want to talk to you
Excuse me
Hey, who is she?
What do you mean?
What?
Why did you beat him up?
He tried to steal from you!
Who said so?
why does it matter
Why would you want to be with a theif?
How old is he?
And how old are you?
Your not young anymore!
Your Right,he does it for money,
but he can make me happy
Do ya'think after all these years
you could make me happy?
Do you?
Right, I never made you
happy before
Then, let's be unhappy together
What do you want?
You know it pretty well
I've told you many times
I won't tell you anymore
You want to find your
own mother, right?
Go and find her yourself
if you can
I've taken care of you
for so many years,
Anything I want to say,
Ive said it long ago
I didn't say it before because
I didn't want you to leave me
And I still won't tell you now 
Cause I don't think it's worth it
to tell you,
...what do I get if
you go and find her?
Nothing!
And you'll forget me as well
Will you quit starring at me?
OK, I want you to hate me
At least, you won't forget me
Come on, treat me better
Maybe, I will tell you someday
But , now is not the right time
Alright, I will wait for
that time
Is his mother rich?
I think so, she used to be
a prostitute before
How long have you known him?
awhile,He used to live upstairs
above me
Do you know
whats on his mind?
I have no idea
But I know whats on your mind
Whats that?
Quit thinking you have a chance 
with me
It's so late, what're you doing here?
Waiting for my friend
What's the matter?
A girl downstairs said
that she knows you,
you'd better go & have a look
Excuse me
Why did you come here?
I'd like to get my things
Come up then
I'd like to stay with you
What for?
I'm not right for you
I'm not the marrying kinda guy
I don't mind
I just want to stay with you
Why cant you get over me?
You can't please me
for my whole life!
You won't be happy staying with me
Did you ever love me?
I don't know how many other 
women I'd fall for in my life
I won't know who I love
till the end of my life
Wait here
I'll go get your things for you
is someone else here?
Whos that out there?
none of your business!
Take off you slippers
Why?
They belong to someone else
If their hers ,gimme some proof
Are you going to take 'em off?
No!
A woman comes out of nowhere,
...and she claims that these
are hers
How would I know how many other
women would come back here
If someone comes up and says 
that you are hers
should I give up?
I give her nothing
Once I step in here,
everything is mine
Why'd  you come up?
I told you to stay downstairs
I'm leaving
Well, sleep with the
slippers tonight
All you care about are the slippers?
OK, I'll return it to her
Are you satisfied?
Somehow, nothing in this
house belongs to me!
What am l? I'd better leave!
Don't come back once you leave
Do you treat all women like this?
I won't be as stupid as her!
What are you doing?
Why do you treat me like this?
Stop it, that hurts...
Hey it's you again?
Why don't you go home?
all your troubles will be solved
after a good sleep
Can you lend me few dollars
for me to take a cab?
I've only got $5, is that enough?
How can I pay you back?
Forget it
I'm always on duty around here
I'm sure you'll see me again
It's you
I'm returning the money I borrowed
No hurry, it doesn't matter
Sorry about that
Thanks! Are you alright?
I'm leaving now,
I have to go to work
So late at night?
What kind of job?
I am working in the SCAA
There's a game tonight,
Im working in the box office
Then can I have a free ticket
for the football match
I used to always go,
but now, so I'm busy
If you want to see
any game in the future,
just come see me
Then thanks a lot
Bye
Can we talk?
I can't help you about
your boyfriend
I just want to talk
You dont have any friends?
I don't want anyone else to know
Then what about me?
If I don't...
If I don't say it out,
I'm afraid I'll go crazy
I thought that I would be OK
I always tell myself
Don't tell anyone 
you're problems
Work hard
Go home and sleep earlier
I want to go home!
But my home is in Macao
I don't know how to
kill these nights
I can't sleep
I didn't mean to come back
I promised myself that
I wouldn't go back anymore
I'll hate myself if I go back again
I don't want to hate myself
Help me please
You can't go on like this
I'll be OK by getting
through this night
You are cheating yourself
by saying that
How did you pass last night?
If you passed last night,
you wouldn't be here tonite
You should make up your mind
If you really can't live without him,
...why don't you tell him?
If you dont, pretend you never 
met him
from this very minute
Don't mention "this very minute"
I always think that a minute
passes very fast
But sometimes it takes along time
One day, he pointed at
his watch and told me,
...he would remember me
forever for that very minute
It was the nicest thing Ive heard
But now when I look at a watch,
...l'll tell myself,
...l have to forget this man
from that very minute
When I was young in Macao,
I dreamed about riding a tram
Whenever my cousin returned
from Hong Kong
I would ask her when she would
take me to HK
Your cousin is from Hong Kong?
No, but she studied in
HK when she was young
She's great,
she got a job in an office
just after graduation
And her boyfriend is
very smart 
She is going to get married soon
Not everyone has good luck
Don't compare yourself
to your sister
I didn't think that
I was poor before
Till I found out that
I didn't have a new uniform every year
But my classmates all had new ones
At that moment,
I realised that I was poor
What made you want to join the
police?
I wanted to be a sailor
But my mother's health
wasnt very good
And there was no-one else to 
watch her at home
So I had to stay to
take care of her
Don't you think it's boring
walking around all the night?
I don't think so
I'm tired, I want to go
home now
If you want to talk again,
...come see me
But I don't want to interfere
your working hours
You can phone me then
I am here around this
time everyday
Hey, do you have enough
money for the fare?
Yes, bye
I never dream that
she would call me
But I always stop in front of
the telephone booth
Maybe she went back to Macao
Or maybe she just wants someone
to kill a night with her
Soon after, my mother passed
Then I changed to become a sailor
Son, come to eat your meal
It's ready now
Ranjet, come and eat
Do want me to hit you?
"My heart is broken..."
Am I pretty?
Have you cleaned the floor?
Of course, but your floor dries
fast
I can swear if you don't believe
me
You can swear all you want to 
So what if I
haven't cleaned it?
Why should I curse myself?
I'll clean it when I come back, OK?
Alright, I'll clean it before I go out
Can't you cheer up a bit?
You seem so upset
I'll treat you to the cinema, OK?
I still have a few bugs with me
Are you very poor?
Maybe I can support you
My sister has transferred to
work in a Oriental Nightclub
She said it was easy to earn
a living being a club girl
But you have to pick me up
every night after work
Then I will be your "girl" then
Being happy is the most
important thing
I won't tell anyone
You still want to go to the movies?
Let's go then
But I want to fix my hair first
You don't have to change?
Hey, you still haven't
changed your shoes
I had breakfast with an
Old Man this morning
He realised that
I wasnt happy
He asked me to go to
USA with him
I know pretty well that,
...at my age
It's difficult to find someone
who really likes me
Since he treats me so well
I'm fine with it!
Though he's quite old,
but he has a kind heart
What do you think?
I won't come back anymore
If you want to, you can go with me
I won't force you if you don't want to
Of course you can't force me
You want to leave yourself
stop dreaming!
You force me to be
with you all these years
And now you just said
that you would go
I won't let you go!
I've taken care of you
for so many years
I won't dessert you
I have arranged everything for you
I will leave you the house
I'll send you money every month
I dont want anything
I just want you to stay here
You always want to
keep me with you
So now I won't let you go
If you even dare to leave
You want to scare me?
Alright, I wont leave
I'll be old in a  few years
Does that mean you'll
take care of me?
For what can you take care of me?
I don't care
If not, we will die together then
This is your dream
You did a good job!
You have been a fought me
all these years
Can't you be a bit better to me?
You shouldn't have told me
that Iam adopted
Everything wwould then be perfect
You let me know a little
and hide a bit,
...I only want to know
who are my true parents
Why don't you tell me?
Don't you know that you are
giving me an excuse to hate you?
You can go and find out yourself
The Philippines is not
so big after all,
go & find them
You wouldnt dare going!
You're afraid to find out that
your mother is poor
And she's not from a famous family,
maybe worse than me
That's not your business
I'll never give up if you don't tell me
We can keep playing this game
You will have to tell me the truth
some fine day
I dont want to hear it from others
I want you to tell me by yourself
Unless you've died
Then we will be happy
I shouldnt have told you before
But I'll tell you,
...that you're not my own blood
I know you would leave me
I always think that I'll be alright
I never know that I am
unwilling to let you go
I know not telling you, that
...l am being selfish
I do it because I want to protect you
They planned to leave you
If they really want to contact 
you,
they would've come to find you long ago
You would'nt understand
I know that you wont listen
to whatever I say now
You spoiled yourself for these years
& put all the responsibility on me,
you want revenge
Alright
...I'll tell you who your mother is now
I can't take it anymore
You always use such an excuse before
You can't use it any longer
You want to go, right?
Alright, go now
Go as far as you can
Don't let me know that
you are cheating yourself
Have you made up your mind?
I've said it so many times
It's time to go for once
That's good
Have you planned
how long you'll stay?
I don't know what
would happen there
And I don't know when
I 'll return
Take care of yourself
Doesn't she know that
you're leaving?
I have to leave no matter
if she knows it or not
Tell her that I've moved if
she comes to bother you
Take it
I know youve always liked it
Treat it well!
Has he ever come here?
cant you hear me?
Don't think that
you can ignore me?
I know you two meet all the time
Why do you have to be so cheap?
He has said he didn't like you already
Why can't you just leave him?
are you done?
Now he left you and your that one
that should be at home crying
Why are you telling me this?
I don't wanna know that
he treated me so bad,
...and treated you the same 
way
Don't touch me
He treats all women the same
We are almost closed,
you have to leave soon
I shouldn't be here actually
I shouldn't give you such
a chance to feel better
But I feel he likes me a bit more
No matter what,
he left you because of me
It's better for you to
know it now
I know your at home crying 
over him 
I recovered long ago
What's the matter?
Did your son ever come back?
No
Then do you know
where can I find him?
No, he never tells me
anything about him
If you ever see him
Tell him that Mimi
is looking for him
Hes got my phone number
I don't know whether
I will see him or not
I am leaving tomorrow
Will he be leaving with you?
Can I come in for a minute?
He used to tell me
to wait downstairs before
I really wanted to know...
...what this house looked like
It's just the same
Am I silly?
No, I was the same
when I was still young
Do you want me to call
a cab for you?
No, thanks
It's you, I think it's York!
He left for the Philippines
Why are you following me?
Go away,
I don't want to see your face again
Why do you want me to leave?
I'm only following you to 
make sure nothing happens to you
I don't want you to be nice to me!
like I've told you before
You have no chance
with me
I'm taken 
You have his car now,
and you want me too?
It doesn't mean that I'll be 
with you when hes gone
I love him 
What are you doing?
Get away from me!
What do you want?
I really want to go to
the Philippines
I really want to go!
here's some money
Why so much money?
Just like you've said,
it has to be matched
He looks good in that car
I wonder what I will
look like in that car
So, it's better for me to sell it
Go to the Philippines
if you really want to
Say sorry to York for me
when you see him
Tell him that I sold his car
If you really can't find York,
...come back to me then
On 12th April, 1961
At last, I came to my mother's house
But she didn't want to see me
The maids told me that she wasnt there
By the time I left this house,
...l knew that there was someone
behind starring at me
Though I wouldn't come
back again
I just want to see her for once
To look at her face
Since she didn't give me a chance,
I won't give her a chance
Any spare rooms?
Yes, the rent will be $30,
$5 for one extra bed
How many days do you
want to stay?
Two days, I have to wait
for the ship
Thanks
Who's that?
Sir, are you alone?
What?
Not yet
What do you want?
what? You don't like me?
Easy!
Don't tell me that
you'll help me
Wake up, you don't want 
to sleep here?
Hey! wake up?
This isnt a place youd want
to fall asleep at
Hey, wake up!
You haven't left?
I just came back
You have friends here?
He's just my friend
Am I bothering you?
No
She's really pretty
Have you ever been
here before?
ChinaTown is quite a small place
Many people come
and stay at this inn
Almost everyone
stays here
Are you from HK?
Yeah!
What do you do?
I'm a Sailor
How long?
Not very long , I just started
I used to be a cop before
Not bad
Why'd you change
your profession?
I just wanted to wander around
How long have you
been in the Philippines?
A few months already
What for? Work?
I don't like working
I am here to look for my family
Then have you found them?
something like that
What time is it?
I have no watch
Half past three
Why don't we go
have a drink?
It's already too late
If its late for you,
why not just stay here?
I have wine here, you can have it
I am homeless
I have to go to the station
at sunrise
And that's only a few hours away
Drinkings better than sleeping
till sunrise
Are you leaving for somewhere else?
It's boring to stay in one place
for along time
As what you've said,
to wander around
Hey, do you want some?
Thanks
Then when will you go back?
Till they have all the
goods unloaded
I think it probably
takes about 2 days time
How about you?
Will you go back?
Maybe, even though...
I think it takes quite
a long period of time
Maybe we'll meet each other
on the streets of HK
We probably wont notice 
eachother though
I hope not
Have I ever met you before?
My memory isnt that great
Me too
Get out of here! Go!
Go!
Get out of here!
Hey! Which train are
you going to take?
I'm not taking it yet
So what are you
coming here for?
I'm meeting someone
I've got some business to do
I owe you this meal,
I'll get ya next time
This is a very good american passport
Highest quality around 
This is my job, do you like it?



That was fast!
Stop him!
Go!
Have you ever been to the USA?
Why don't you talk?
Are you afraid of missing your ship?
Not everybody is like you!
Dont you care if you died!
I have to work, to earn my living,
don't you know?
If you want a  passport,
buy it with money!
You shouldnt cause
so much trouble!
Don't you know that
we were almost killed!
Didnt you think you
would be killed?
Men will easily get killed,
may be by a train accident!
no-one knows then they'll die?
I don't care what you think,
but don't drag me down!
I told you to leave first,
now it's you following me!
I wish they did kill you!
Did you ever heard of
a bird which...
Yes!
The bird with no legs!
You can only cheat
those innocent girls
Are you like a bird?
How?
You're like the drunkard
picked up from the garbage
of China Town!
Don't you think you are
like a bird?
If you could fly,
you would not have to be here
Go and fly,
if you have such ability!
There is a chance!
But don't look down upon
yourself if this day come
Tell me
When can we arrive the next stop?
I don't know what
you are talking about!




Thanks
That day when I came out
from the hospital,
I felt very free
I didnt need to  worry about
living any longer
I will get US$50 monthly
till the boy is 18
I do want to know
is this the end shot of my life
So, I must'nt close
my eyes when I die
How about you?
What do you want to see
most when your life ends
Life is so long, they're many 
things that I have'nt seen
I dunno
I cant think of anything
Think harder
Since your job is so boring!
Life actually isnt long,
Its time to think about it
There was a bird...
Which lied and flied until it died
It never goes to anywhere
Because it died from the start
I've said that
I'll never know which woman is my true love
I wonder what she's doing now
Dawn breaks
It looks fine today
How about sunset?
When I last saw him,
I asked him a question
Do you remember 
3 pm of April 16, last year?
Do you remember what
you were doing on that day?
Why are you asking me this?
Nevermind 
A friend of mine always wants
to challenge my memory
He asked me what 
I'd done on that day
I cant remember, how about you?
Did she tell you?
I think that you've already forgot!
I can remember what
should be remembered
Did you two used to date?
off and on 
After my new job,
we hardly see eachother
How about you?
me?
No
What else did she tell you?
Nothing else
Actually,I lied we knew each other
for a short period of time only
Do you like her?
It's different, we were only friends
When you see her again, tell her...
...l've forgot everything
This is good for the both of us
Maybe I will never see her again
Even if I can see her,
Maybe she wont recognise me
You came here alone, Aren't you afraid?
I heard that people from HK
always stay here 
So I need to talk to you , 
I'm looking for someone
