Something just happened again.
No one wanted to believe...
this could happen in our own backyard.
But as soon as the storywas out,
the finger-pointing began.
Some blamed it on money.
On greed.
Others blamed it on sex.
And others said it was our modem times,
the godless and egotistical society.
The Austrians blamed the non-Austrians.
And the vegetarians said that...
eating meat was what started it all.
But here's what I say:
Theywere allwrong.
If it weren't for love
none of this would have happened.
What do they mean by 1 :3?
One part antifreeze, three parts water.
That's 4.5 liters.
4.5 liters? -Yes.
That's too much water.
Works without water down to -73°C.
Any amount of water is fine.
Wait, that means three parts water...
plus one third antifreeze.
Not one third, one fourth!
Use your head.
How is it going to freeze here?
You're asking me?
-15°C tops.
It doesn't get any colder?
Not here in the West.
You sure?
Different climate.
In SouthAmerica, for example in Brazil...
it's summer now.
I know that!
You think I'm an idiot?
But it's winter here.
Still a different climate.
Good evening.
I don't think 3 parts water will even fit.
That hurts!
Stop it!
Should I have a look?
No.
Next time I'm buying it pre-mixed.
Go have a look!
That's what I said.
Go on!
I'm going.
Where are you?
Where?
Left? Right?
Over here.
Shall we go?
Why do you keep me waiting?
I'm here now.
Where are we eating?
A cool place, American.
With motorcycles on the walls.
What kind?
Real ones.
On the walls?
Yeah, I thought you'd like that.
Fuck the motorcycles,
the food is what counts!
Get in the car!
What's going on here?
THE BONE MAN
Wait here!
You have the keys?
No.
-Hand them over!
Please, moneywas tight.
I'll pay somehow...
Be reasonable, please!
-No!
You should have paid on time!
I know,
but I need the car, please.
Sorry.
You got 3 reminders, right?
I'm a single mom,
We need to get to kindergarten. Please.
Talk to the leasing company!
No.
Please, step aside!
Let me out on the other side ofthe bridge.
A small beer!
Hi, Brenner.
Done.
Thanks.
This is lsabel!
Hello.
-Hi!
We met last night at the Skybar.
Cheers.
Have a nice day.
Can you take care of one more?
Berti, I've had it. I'm sick ofthis job.
C'mon, please.
Besides, I'm going away.
Where to?
-The country.
Perfect.
That's where I need you.
Berti, I lied.
I only said that...
because I thought
you wanted me here in the city.
It's just a short drive.
Yeah, right.
An artist.
An artist?
-Yeah, some nutty painter.
Drove out this summer,
and no word from him since.
Deliver the third reminder,
and you're done.
Go yourself.
Brenner...
Please.
What kind of car?.
A lemon yellow Beetle.
A lemon yellow Beetle?
They're so cute.
They've got little vases in them for flowers.
Hello.
Hi. What can I get you?
Black coffee, extra water.
Do you have guest rooms?
-Upstairs.
You want a room?
No, a guest.
We're empty.
It's off-season.
I'm looking for Mr. Horvath.
Why?
What do you mean "why"?
Why should he be here?
Is he here or isn't he?
There's no Horvath here.
His car is parked out front.
I'll be right back.
What do you want?
-I'm looking for Horvath.
Who's that?
-A painter.
A painter.
I didn't want that much extra water.
No more coffee.
The machine is broken.
A small beer.
We're not open yet.
Really?
-Really.
Nice hospitality for a guest house.
We're an inn,
but you were on your way out.
Enjoy your job!
Forgot your cigarettes.
What can I get you?
I'm not thirsty anymore.
You a journalist?
Why?
There's no Horvath here.
Then why is his car out front?
What car?
I don't care ifthe company makes a profit,
here's my offer:
We have four people already.
Ifwe get one more,
I'll give you this blanket worth 49.90...
for just 40 euros even.
Who's in?
40 euros even!
No, I didn't order anything.
Go ahead.
Retiree's Club is paying.
I'm not with them.
Whatever.
You knowHorvath?
Oh, you're the guy.
Are you a cop?
-No.
Private eye?
Who are you?
-The boss.
Pauli, stop chatting and get back to work.
Here you go, Mr...
Brenner.
Mr. Brenner.
Well?
Well what?
-The car.
Did it reappear to you?
Maybe it's global warming,
and we're starting to get
fata morganas here too.
You know what?
Spare me your jokes.
I have enough fun in life.
Yeah, that's how you look.
How do I look?
-Like someone who has fun in life.
Chicken's on the house.
I don't like chicken.
You'll like ours.
Give this gentleman some chicken.
I'm not eating it.
Then don't.
Excuse me.
Can I ask you something?
-You can ask.
Thanks.
Can I leave a message for him?
For whom?
Can't you talk to me in normal tone ofvoice?
Like you're doing?
My regards to Horvath
ifyou see him.
Tell the jerk to pay,
or we repossess his car. OK?
How much does he owe?
I don't know, it's in the car.
Find out, and I'll get it for you.
I want 20,000 for starters.
You'll never leave me alone.
Forget it!
-I'll be back!
Mind if I join you?
What do you want?
You have a license?
A license?
As a private investigator.
As a forklift operator.
I'm not some stupid country kid.
What do you want?
I might have a job for you.
Ifyou're a professional.
Money keeps disappearing.
Be more careful.
-I knowwho it is.
My father.
Your father?.
And which one ofyou is the boss?
I'm just the boss' son.
He's the boss.
Then he can do whatever he wants.
He's ruining the business.
What am I supposed to do?
Can't you shadowhim or something?
Shadow him?
How do I do that?
He knows me now.
Guess howmuch is gone.
1 30,000 euros.
Look, I don't care, really.
What's the going rate with you?
Ten percent.
Ten percent ofwhat?
1 30,000 euros.
Is that alright?
I'll think about it.
...5, 6, 7, 8...
Morning.
Why are you still here?
I spent the night.
Why did you spend the night?
I wanted to spend the night.
I don't know howyou do it.
How I spent the night here?
-No.
Do what you do.
It's an awful profession!
What profession?
I imagine everywhere I go...
people frown as soon as they see me.
How do you stand it?
So much negative energy.
Can I get some coffee?
Oh sure, sorry.
Black, with milk, extra water?
Quiet.
I can make quiet ones too.
Thanks.
I actually just started...
working as a debt collector.
What did you do before?
I was a cop for years.
Why did you quit?
Too much negative energy.
People would frown when they saw me.
The restaurant business is better,
although...
when they're really drunk...
You never fiind the perfect job.
-What?
You never fiind the perfect job.
Do you want breakfast?
Sure.
Paul Löschenkohl.
I thought it over. I'll do it.
It's a little late.
What?
I'm doing it myself. Bye.
Shit.
Where did he go?
Are you crazy?
Fucking asshole!
Are you trying to kill me?
That's what you get for spying!
Papa!
At least help me!
Don't leave me here to die! Papa!
Fucking asshole!
Don't leave me stranded!
Good morning.
Morning, Alex.
Here's 3 months, and...
afterthat, payment by standing order.
Why are you paying?
-ls it any ofyour business?
Maybe.
Something's burning.
It's supposed to.
Eggs, cooked special.
The way he likes them.
How does he like them?
Shaken or stirred?
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Tell Mr. Horvath I said hi!
I'll tell him.
Do you knowthis Horvath?
No.
Hi.
The leasing company...
wants to knowwhere the car is!
I wanted to bring it last night,
but it snowed.
Snowed?
Total snow chaos.
The news didn't mention any snow chaos.
Berti, I'll call you later, OK?
Can I help?
Yeah.
I've never seen anything like this.
Why are you crushing it?
For feed.
Who eats this stuff?
-The chickens.
The fresh ones are cheaper that way.
Wow.
It's a never-ending cycle.
Not exactly nature's cycle, though.
Why not?
That's cannibalism.
But no chemical additives.
Organic.
Yeah.
This goes to the chicken farm.
Thanks.
See you later.
No, I'm going back to Vienna.
I'm done here.
I see. Good-bye.
Hey.
Yeah?
A chicken farm...
-Yeah?
What's it like?
Hard to explain. Why?
Be interested to know.
You may never eat chicken again.
I don't like chicken anyway.
In that case,
get in.
Go ahead and smoke.
I smoke too much anyway.
No, really. I don't mind.
You're just saying that.
No, smoke, please.
You sure?
-Yeah.
As long as you don't kiss me.
You spoiled my cigarette.
My husband.
That's your husband?
What's going on?
That fucking bastard!
Who?
He withdrew more money.
Then he drove me offthe road.
The maniac! They should lock him up.
Pauli, it's his money.
It's my moneytoo.
I didn't work all my life for nothing.
Since when do you work?
That's newto me.
You're just like him.
You're not all there.
-Don't touch me.
Divorce me, and marry my father.
The perfect couple.
He can't fuck and you won't.
The two ofyou...
I'll get a lawyer. Just you wait!
And he is going to fiind out...
what that old bastard
is doing with the money.
Wait, I'm not doing anything.
Get out please!
Out!
-lt wasn't like that.
It really wasn't!
-Get out!
Great!
Was that necessary?
Are we back in business?
No.
1 5,000 euros. Cash.
I charge extra for morons.
Fucking city slickers!
Don't be so childish!
C'mon, give me a...
Twentythousand.
Yes.
That's all I have.
Give me the cassette now!
You know how many men I've killed?
Five.
Five people.
And I still sleep like a baby.
And do you knowwhy?
I had a good reason for every one ofthem.
How do you sleep?
It was an accident.
It was a very nice funeral.
The family cried and cried.
Lots of relatives.
Flowers. Food.
Big feast. Very expensive.
It turns out he has an illegitimate child.
It all costs money.
That's all I've got.
I want another seventy thousand.
I can't give you what I don't have.
You have a very nice Porsche.
But it belongs to my son.
C'mon, be more cooperative.
You're the Papa, take it from him
and give it to me.
No, I can't do that.
Maybe that's howyou people are...
You want to fiind out?
I can showyou howwe are.
I want that Porsche tonight.
I want to set something straight.
Can I just say 3 things?
1. I didn't accept your husband's offer.
2. I'm not planning to either.
And 3...
I don't need a numberthree.
I'd like to be alone.
You'll have to shut the door.
Nice place.
I'm not quite settled in yet.
At least it's warmer.
-We get the heaters in May.
Is this the living room?
And kitchen.
There, an open kitchen...
with the dining area
and living room.
This goddamn house!
I wish I could just blow it up.
It's not the house's fault.
It's halfhis.
Then I'd blow it up.
But just his half.
Aren't you cold?
I'm freezing.
Can you warm up to this?
To what?
I've never smoked one.
Never?.
-No.
Then you better not.
I don'twant to corrupt you.
Yeah,
you're right.
Maybe I'll go away.
Go where?
Anywhere.
Start over.
Fresh start.
What would you do?
Work in a restaurant.
It's all I know how to do.
Jerk.
My body feels like rubber.
Rubber would be cool.
Ifyou're made of rubber, and you fall down,
you automatically bounce back up.
Say that again.
Ifyou're made of rubber and you fall,
you bounce back up,
Iike a ball.
Why?
Forget it.
What are you waiting for?.
What do you mean "waiting"?
Just in general.
What should I be waiting for?
I don't expect much anymore.
I wish I could take you home.
I've heard that before.
But nobody does it.
Well, I'm serious.
Just say the word.
I better not.
But you want to leave.
Not to go to Austria.
I want to go home.
Good evening.
What can I get you?
The boss said
I could borrow a tarp.
So?
I'd get it,
but I don't know where it is.
Neither do l.
The storeroom.
I don't know where that is,
but since you work here,
you might.
What are my chances?
You know what I wish?
I hope it's not indecent.
It is.
I won't be able to sleep at night.
That's normal at your age.
Whose clothes are these?
Guests forget things.
I could use some.
I didn't bring any.
Then go home.
What are you doing?
Look at this!
Mr. Horvath!
He forgot a lot.
He's probably running around naked.
That's old stuffhe threw away.
Old stuff?
These shoes are brand new!
He's throwing more clothes away
than I own!
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Mr. Horvath is working on
an important exhibition...
and doesn't want to be disturbed.
And you happen to know that?
I'm his sister.
He saw the suitcases.
Then hide them.
Why?
Horvath won't be needing them.
Sometimes I get so scared.
We'll get through this.
You're still here.
I thought you were done here.
I decided to extend.
Because ofthe fresh air?.
Yeah.
And the friendly people.
Here, I'll help you.
Aren't you bored in the country?
-No, todaywas fascinating.
I sawyour machine.
My machine?
-ln the basement.
Who showed it to you?
Your daughter-in-law.
Room number?
Seventeen.
See, that's how it is in the country.
What?
You meet the whole family.
At the end ofthe day you know everyone.
Except Horvath.
Yeah, yeah. Good night, Mr. Brenner.
Same to you.
Wait here.
Want a drink?
No, the Porsche.
My son drove off in it.
You take me for a fool?
That's not healthy.
-C'mon, have a drink.
You listen to me:
I can sell your little cunt,
and she'll end up between lstanbul
and the Black Sea.
Turkish men are mean when they fuck.
Or I can sell her to special customers.
They make very nice videos.
The girls never come back.
But I can get you one ofthe videos.
Having trouble sleeping?
Can I put this on my tab?
Are you always up this early?
Masquerade ball tonight.
Lots offood to prepare.
What are you cooking?
Goulash.
Goulash.
Hey,
mind if I dunk?
-What?
I'm so hungry.
Yeah?
He's signing it over next year,
then I'll be the boss.
You said that 2 years ago.
But next year it's happening.
Sure.
Stop laughing!
Stop laughing!
Who do you think you are?
You'll never be anyone's boss.
Now get out ofhere!
Aren't you eating?
Too early for me.
You're really missing out.
It's so tender.
When I make myself a steak,
it's always as tough as leather.
Don't salt it until the last minute.
Right before it goes in the pan.
C'mon, Pauli!
Your clothes stink, get out of here!
C'mon, let's snuggle.
-Kiss my ass!
Fine with me.
-Oh God.
Good.
Someone is in there.
No driver's license.
File a report!
We'll notify the authorities in Bratislava.
Serbian passport?
-Bratislava?
The car is from there.
Pauli!
What happened?
Accident.
Want to go ice skating?
I have to go shopping.
For what?
Underwear.
I can give you a ride.
Ifyou don't mind a detour.
-Detour?
I might need your help.
For what?
Come and see.
Watch this!
OK.
Lie on your stomach!
That hurts a little.
No!
But I don't want to go to Austria.
You can go home ifyou don't like it.
I promise.
But I don't have a passport.
All my papers are in the safe.
And Evgenjev...
He'll kill us all.
Oh, he won't do anything.
It'll all work out.
This is Mr. Brenner.
He used to be a cop.
How long?
1 9 years.
Wiith the police for 1 9 years.
He's your bodyguard now.
Hi, Berti!
You picked a bad time!
What do you mean "bad"?
You know what that car costs per day?
Yeah, I know.
You know you're paying for it too?
I know.
Then when do I get the car?.
Tomorrow?
No, not tomorrow!
Today, I need it today!
Can't do it today!
Why?
Because I can't do it today!
Where are you?
In Bratislava, I'm out of change.
In Bratislava!
With the leased car!
That's enough, you dirty pervert!
What's going on?
Pervert!
Is Evgenjev back yet?
Give me your hand.
Is Evgenjev back yet?
Not yet.
Damn!
What was that?
I don't know.
I'll have a look.
No chance without a blowtorch.
Shit.
Let's go.
Don't catch cold!
Where the hell is Evgenjev?
Hi.
Give me a hand.
Give her my flat
and move me into room 3.
Have fun.
What?
I said: Have fun.
One more word and I kick your ass.
All I said was "have fun".
There's no harm in saying "have fun".
Get out!
I said: Get out!
-I'm on my way.
Blow job, no rubber,
and I come in your mouth.
You're never hitting me again!
Ana is dead.
And Evgenjev?
Missing.
The Austrians don't even know
Evgenjev was in the car.
Did you get me my visa?
Maybe he's just lying low?
I don't think so.
He would have called.
You're 100 euros short!
What's wrong with you?
Can't you see I've got problems?
You're talking about a measly 100 euros!
