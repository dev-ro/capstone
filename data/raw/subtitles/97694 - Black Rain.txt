BLACK RAIN
August 6, 1945
I took a day off to ship
our belongings.
We used Mr. Nojima's truck.
They're evacuating Hiroshima.
Grandmother's best formal kimono
and things...
Great-grandmother's silk wedding
gown.
It's precious.
Also Grandfather's formal wear
and mine.
Everything's together with all
my stuff...
And my diploma.

August 6. It was a hot morning.
I hurried to the station
to go to the factory where I work.
The air raid?
All clear.
Good morning, Mr. Shizuma.
Good morning!
Have you already signed
the paper I brought to you?
What's that?
What happened?
It's getting dark.
Is it a shower?
No, not in the morning.
Burned except shadows.
Why?
It was a fierce light.
Too bad.
A horrible new weapon.
No broadcasting?
The fire's
spreading.
Nojima knows many fishermen.
He'll find a boat.
He'll go to the factory.
Yasuko will come to my office
there.
Does she know you're going
there today?
Yes. It's like a bet, but...
What are you doing?
May I take some cucumbers?
Why not?
Come on. Let's bring her home.
Hurry.
Leave the pumpkin. Come on!
Can't open it.
It's OK.
Yasuko!
Aunt!
Don't rub your face
with your dirty hands.
Uncle. Your face?
What? Burned a little.
Why the stains?
The black rain fell.
Did an oil tank blow up?
Give me some water.
Yasuko, the fire's spreading.
Let's go to your uncle's factory!
What are you doing?
Hurry!
Hurry!
Be careful of the wires...
Okay?
Come on!
If I stop moving,
pull me by the belt.
Don't touch my body.
Brother! Brother!
My brother!
Who are you?
It's me, your brother.
My brother? Your name?
Your name and school?
Hiroshima Junior High,
first grade, Class B.
My name is Kyuzo Sukune.
Kyuzo must be wearing gaiters.
They were torn off.
Show me your belt.
Kyuzo! It's you!
Water...
Give me water.
Don't look.
It hurts!
It hurts!
Hiroshima, where are you?
It disappeared!
Fukuyama, May, 1950
Hiroshima Department
You're in perfect health.
The doctor was sure.
This certifies it.
Nothing can stop your marriage.
How are you, Uncle?
The usual. My sickness
isn't serious.
Mr. Shizuma, wait.
A gift for you.
This is it.
What is it?
Herb.
Keep it from the frost.
It's good for your health.
Goodbye.
An aloe.
A medication for burns is
good for me?
Thanks.
We're having a rally.
It's to start an anti-nuclear
drive
to end the use of nuclear
energy.
Please come to the City Hall!
We're all nuclear victims!
Hello. It's been a long time.
Very.
How are you?
Not too well. I feel
dizzy when I work.
You, too?
Yet I must work as long as I live.
You've become even prettier.
It's time you get married.
Yes. It's about time.
Keeping carp?
Oh no!
I hear carp blood is good
for the health.
The Miyoshi train
is entering the station.
Travellers must stay
behind the white line.
By the way,
the post office manager
came last night
to offer you a job.
What do you think?
He should have done it
two years ago.
You'd have to quit if you
got married.
I'll tell him no.
Don't worry.
Anyone getting off?
That idiot again!
Yuichi, that's enough!
Mission accomplished!
Mission accomplished?
I'm sorry.
Mission accomplished!
Good! Mission accomplished!
I'm sorry.
Mr. Shizuma, wait!
Take it. You need it, too.
Thanks.
I'm back.
Welcome home.
Well?
I'm all right.
Dear, what did the doctor say?
She's quite healthy.
He certified it.
That's fine.
Everything will be fine.
No more silly rumors!
Grandma!
I didn't know you were here,
Okiyo.
Here I am.
Your mother thinks Yasuko
is your sister as a young lady.
Don't let it bother you.
She's senile and dying.
It doesn't bother me at all.
Have you
planted all the potatoes?
You're old. Don't work too hard.
I'm all right.
I don't feel sick.
The doctor's wife, either.
But the disease got her.
Be careful.
Thanks a lot.
"Certification of Health."
How considerate!
The go-between was a
soldier's wife.
I thought she'd like it.
You're taking good care of
your dead sister's daughter.
I brought her to Hiroshima
to save her hard labor
at a munitions factory.
The war's to blame.
I hope I'll see her in a
wedding gown soon.
She's a nice girl.
This proposal will be accepted.
I see. Congratulations!
It's not decided yet.
No job is necessary for her.
Invite me to her wedding party.
It looks like a feast.
A little too extravagant.
We were in Hiroshima then.
We need nourishing food.
The doctor said so.
The doctor said so?
Eat some for yourself.
After Yasuko is gone,
we'll be Ionely.
It's not decided that I'll
get married.
Reset the clock.
Like everyday,
your news report.
There's a big carp -
the king of the pond.
I once saw it floating, just once.
Did it work, the carp blood?
Yes. I feel it makes me warm.
White peaches are good, too,
when you have no appetite.
Fishing at a time like this?
I envy you.
Happy-go-lucky people!
Listen.
We're suffering from radiation
sickness.
We want to work.
But if we work hard, our flesh
and blood will rot.
Is that so?
But you're making the best of
having experienced the Bomb.
How can you say that?
When we returned from Hiroshima,
you said we were victims
who deserved respect.
Were your tears fake?
Or did you forget?
It was before the war ended.
Everyone said things like that.
Don't complain now.
I won't.
You think you own this pond?
What? You're wrong.
Everyone has the right to fish
in this pond.
Don't you know?
I do. That's why you fish
here all day long.
That's why I called you
happy-go-lucky people.
Damn widow!
Look at the line.
She makes me angry.
She forgot how Hiroshima
and Nagasaki were destroyed.
Everyone forgot it.
They forgot the hell of fire,
and go to rallies...
I'm sick of it.
Don't say such things in public.
Look, it's hooked.
It's small.
Enemy!
A bomb...
My bombs!
Enemy!
Yuichi! Stop!
Mission accomplished!
Good! Mission accomplished!
Not cured yet?
Getting better, though.
A rare visit.
I took a day off.
A cabaret in Kobe?
No. I work in Fukuyama now.
I'm back.
I'm back!
Anybody home?
Why come home suddenly?
Why not? I'm your daughter.
Were you sleeping with somebody?
What?
Who is he now?
It's not what you think.
He's sick. He needs to rest.
This is my daughter, Fumiko.
She works in Fukuyama.
Hello.
Hi!
He was there when the Bomb
exploded.
So you don't look well.
I travel a lot on business.
I work to eat.
A blackmarketeer.
Business is good, isn't it?
Come see me at the Hollywood.
A cabaret?
I'm afraid I'm not so well.
Excuse me.
Mom...
Yes?
Tell everyone I'm out.
Another man?
A gangster.
I have no daughter.
So the certificate didn't work.
It aroused their suspicion.
They said I was helping the
radiation sickness patients.
Kotaro...
Yes?
Unlike my wife and me, Yasuko
was free from the Bomb.
She was far from Hiroshima.
Can't I explain to them
personally?
They said they already found
a bride.
The groom liked Yasuko,
but his parents said health counts.
No use to see them.
I couldn't help you.
I'm sorry.
Does somebody want to
interfere with us?
Maybe.
Well, then, don't be discouraged.
The hospital?
Not recently.
Better go there once a week.
Yes, but it's bothersome.
You already leave?
Was it Matsukichi?
No, Kotaro.
Well...
How's it going?
Judging from the way he looks,
no good.
Will she work at the mail office?
Who knows?
It's her third proposal.
And she's twenty-five.
She'll be the last of the
Shizuma family.
I hear the Bomb made the women
barren.
Shigeko must be ashamed.
She has no children of her own.
But... Yasuko only walked in
the black rain.
I doubt it.
Some say she was in the city.
It was my fault about the
certificate.
But they mustn't believe the rumor
that she's fatally ill.
Yasuko. Show me your diary.
Since August 6, 1945.
It was only a memo.
That's better. It sounds realistic.
What for?
I'll copy it for the groom.
But he already refused.
We can't keep quiet.
We have to do something.
Well?
About the black rain...
Now we all know it was poisonous.
The groom will be convinced that
she's ill.
Read it.
Dark clouds spread from the city
with lighting and thunder
showering huge raindrops
as black as ink.
Even though it was summer,
I shivered from cold.
Copy as it was written.
It was the black rain.
It was the black rain, not the
Bomb, that hit her.
As her guardians, we must find
her a groom.
That's our duty.
I'll copy my diary, too.
Together with hers,
we'll make an accurate record
of our family.
This way! Through here!
On all fours!
Be careful, or you'll die.
Maybe it was wrong to have
brought
my wife and niece here.
But we had no place to go
except for my factory.
And to go there, we had to
cross the city.
Water...
No water, or you'll die.
The flash of light killed men
and horses,
but the river remained intact.
Where were you
when the Bomb detonated?
At Yokogawa Station.
I was near Hijiyama.
I'd just left the shelter.
Then I saw the flash.
It blinded me. I could see
nothing.
Does it still hurt?
Strangely enough, it doesn't.
I don't feel pain, either.
But I feel pain in my heart,
and it hurts a lot.
My house was ruined.
My wife was killed instantly.
My son's leg was caught between
fallen beams.
I tried hard to lift them,
but in vain.
Finally the fire came.
I told him:
"I can't help you. Forgive me!"
And I ran.
"Dad! Help me!"
"Help me!"
Excuse me. Take care.
Let's go.
Just over there, Aunt.
Mr. Shizuma, you survived!
Mr. Shizuma!
Water!
At the factory,
the chief and workers welcomed
us warmly
to the drawing room.
I was moved to tears.
They welled up endlessly.
Good morning.
Who?
Ueda of Public Service.
He arrived last night.
He writhed in pain.
At dawn, he heaved yellow water.
Then he died.
Chief,
The municipal office was all but
closed. No clerks.
Priests are gone.
Thanks.
Shizuma...
Chant the sutra.
Sutra?
Go to a temple
and learn how to chant.
Even if I can copy them,
we can't save the souls of
the dead with sutras.
Who do you think can do it?
Priest or no priest,
no matter what sect, do it.
That's an order.
I hear Hiroshima vanished.
How awful!
It's a mad world indeed.
It's really the end of times.
How wretched! Deplorable!
At a funeral,
three sutras are chanted first:
"Kisanpoge","Shoshinge",
and "Onenbutsu" in this order.
Next, "Amida Sutra",
of the vicissitudes of three lives.
While you chant it,
the attendants of the funeral offer
incense for the dead.
Next, "The Sacred Letter of
White Bones."
It may be I or you who
departs first.
It may be today or tomorrow.
All men are mortal.
They go to the world beyond
sooner or later.
Youth in the morning may turn,
to white bones in the evening.
They're still wet.
We must wait longer.
The Emperor announces
the surrender of Japan:
"Considering the situation,
"we must terminate this war..."
The water flowed down shining.
Fishes swimming upstream.
That's all I remember about
that day:
August 15, 1945.
Dear, here's a goldfish dealer.
Not a goldfish dealer.
A carp breeder.
Oh well.
Are you all right?
The rash on my head left me
after three days of rest.
Don't worry.
The water temperature and size.
Just perfect.
I'll take them to the big pond.
Then that witch can't say boo
about our fishing.
What did she say to you?
"Fishing at a time like this?
I envy you."
"You're making the best of having
experienced the Bomb."
You tried to make love to her
long ago?
She has a long memory.
We played doctor and patient.
But it was long, long ago.
What are you doing there?
Destroy the tank!
Get out, or you'll be killed.
Cut the engine!
Yuichi! Stop!
Sir!
Enemy tanks in the rear!
What?
Behind that farmhouse.
All right. Forward to the rear!
What are you doing there?
What?
Forward! Forward!
Commander, in there!
Charge!
We've destroyed the enemy tanks.
We succeeded!
Mission accomplished!
I'm sorry!
Thank you!
Some nut.
I'm really sorry.
He used to destroy enemy tanks
that way.
The sound of an engine makes
him crazy.
You're a real expert.
We always forced him to be quiet.
Your strategy is better.
Just an inspiration!
Here's the bus!
Ask them to cut the engine!
Stop! Stop!
Hello, Mr. Shizuma.
Sorry you weren't with us,
but we've just stocked carp fry.
Mr. Shizuma.
Hello. My name is Aono.
Excuse me.
Who?
The hairdresser's nephew.
A prospective groom?
He's handsome.
So you know each other?
I go to his aunt's beauty parlor.
His father runs a factory.
The one near the Ashida River?
Yes.
My aunt told me Yasuko's address.
My parents know everything
about her.
My wife often goes to the parlor.
She told the hairdresser.
It's rather abrupt.
I was hasty.
Is this the meeting of a
prospective bride and groom?
I think so.
Let me court her.
Please.
Please help me.
But it's up to her, you know.
Yes. Cigarettes!
Give me cigarettes!
Kotaro!
Find my daughter a nice husband!
She's a cabaret hostess.
So what? She might be your daughter.
That's a bad joke.
You can't prove it.
Why not?
You laid me more than ten times.
No, not that often.
Yasuko is the rich landowner's
niece.
Naturally you want to help her.
It's not that!
She was not irradiated.
She's the victim of a false rumor.
I pity her!
You all right?
Are you all right?
I get this nausea sometimes.
Maybe it's the Bomb.
What do you think?
Mr. Aono?
Yasuko seems to like him.
You think so, too?
Of course.
It's her last chance.
You can get the radiation sickness
anytime, like me.
I want her to get married
happily while we're alive.
I'm tough enough,
as you see.
As Mr. Aono is so eager, she'll
be able to marry this time.
Who'll get married?
Yasuko.
Yasuko?
Kiyoko,
Kiyoko, your daughter.
Kiyoko's getting married?
I should've seen your sister once.
She died soon after Yasuko
was born.
It's been twenty-five years.
Kiyoko!
Kiyoko, don't get married.
If you do, you'll die.
Grandma.
I won't get married. Don't worry.
Good.
I'd be sorry to lose you.
Don't get married!
Let's go see my old man.
No?
I want to talk.
Do you have a boyfriend?
A secret love or something?
No. Do I look I would?
No. Even if you do,
drop him. I wouldn't mind.
It's not that.
You worried me.
Yasuko,
I love you.
Marry me, no matter what.
Whenever I sell a few acres
of land,
I feel Ionely.
You own hundreds of acres.
Fortunately your forests are
safe from the new law.
It's a deal.
See you later.
Selling the forest?
It's your ancestors' land.
Keep it.
Water...
Give me water...
Give me water...
Mr. Katayama!
Madam!
It's terrible!
Help!
He was from Takafuta?
Yes.
Can we hold his funeral here?
His ex-wife said she wouldn't
care who holds his funeral.
She got married again to his
brother.
He was a stranger here.
He had a lot of trouble.
His father, too.
He died before those who were
exposed to the Bomb.
It can happen to me, too.
Too bad...
Really...
Did you bring it?
Yes, here with me.
Read it.
While observing man's transient
life,
everything in this world
is vain and empty.
Life is like a dream or a vision.
Never before did a man
survive hundreds of years.
Life is so short...
Today is already yesterday.
It may be I or you who depart
first.
It may be today or tomorrow.
All men are mortal.
They go to the world beyond
sooner or later.
Anyone who belonged to the troop
from Takafuta?
Anyone from Kobatake?
Shokichi! It's me, Shizuma.
It's you, Shigematsu!
I miraculously survived.
I'm Katayama from Takafuta.
I'm Shizuma.
Your hand...?
Nothing.
We came here to rescue the drafted
workers from our town.
Kotaro is around here.
I'm glad you've managed to
stay alive.
Where to?
Ujina, by order of the chief.
Hiroshima vanished.
Yes. It's gone.
War is bad.
My father's factory is thriving,
thanks to the Korean War.
Business is good.
We can go anywhere you like for
our honeymoon.
Listen.
My uncle's friend, who walked
in Hiroshima for two days
after the bombing, died.
Radioactivity?
The three of us, too,
were in the city all that day.
My uncle has the symptoms.
I know.
Did you tell your parents?
You and your aunt are safe.
Father said women are tough,
and laughed.
It's all right.
A carp?
No, a dace.
You're from Fukuyama?
No, from Fuchu.
You brought a doctor here?
Shokichi, the master here, is sick.
No. A hairdresser named Aono.
Full of fry!
A hairdresser, not a doctor?
Thank you.
The fry are growing.
Yes. They're growing fast.
Why the glasses?
Something's wrong with my eyes
lately. I have a tick.
Today's news.
The Korean War is expanding
throughout the peninsula.
Hello.
I'll be back when you finish
eating.
Have some tea.
Come over here.
Come on in.
No, I stay here.
All right.
About the marriage proposal...
So he refused?
You know?
The hairdresser went to Shokichi.
He looked blue.
He had to tell her the truth.
I don't mean to blame him.
I feel sad to see Yasuko the butt
of ridicule.
So Shokichi betrayed her.
That young idiot!
I'll bring him here even by force.
Mr. Kotaro,
I told him the truth.
What?
Nobody can tell when I'll fall ill,
like Katayama.
I told Aono.
When was it?
Today, at noon.
The hairdresser was with Shokichi
at noon.
She's collecting information about
Yasuko here and there.
Somebody's interfering with us.
Fumiko's mother.
She needled me...
to find her daughter a groom.
The black rain fell on Yasuko.
It's true.
But she wasn't in Hiroshima
that time.
People prefer bad rumors to
the truth.
Anyway, it's best
to ask Mr. Aono how he feels
about her.
That's right.
I'll see him tomorrow.
Mr. Kotaro...
That's enough.
I won't get married.
What are you saying?
Fumiko's mother is Fumiko's mother.
I'm... me.
They'll know the truth.
The black rain was poisonous.
Thank you for everything.
Because I'm incapable, it turned
to a dream.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
Uncle.
Aunt.
I just want to stay with you,
the three of us together.
Uncle, you have the symptoms.
The sickness can catch you anytime,
Aunt.
I can't leave you at a time
like this.
I feel all right.
And don't worry about
your uncle's health.
Your aunt is right.
We live our life, you live yours.
Unless you get happily married,
your parents...
If you get married and leave us,
I'd be sorry for our ancestors.
Who are you?
Yasuko's mother? Kiyoko?
My daughter...
The Bomb got her...
Sister-in-law...
you know about the Bomb?
Don't believe this woman.
Tell me, sister-in law:
Why can't Yasuko
get married?
Sister-in law...
tell me. Say something.
Visit your family grave.
Then Yasuko will get married.
I understand.
Don't let my mother influence you.
But what the psychic told me
was reasonable.
Your sister was worried about
Yasuko when she died.
Let's visit her grave.
Forget it.
You mean you give up Yasuko's
marriage?
It's not that.
You copied her diary because
you want her happily married.
Sure.
Then why?
Those psychics always give the
same advice: Visit the grave.
They cheat you making the best of
your misfortune.
But visiting the grave isn't bad
at all.
No, but...
I had no chance to see your sister.
Sometimes I feel Yasuko
is my sister-in-law.
Are you senile?
No...
She must have had many regrets
when she died.
I'll visit her grave.
I haven't seen your wife for
a long time.
I should've brought her, but
my mother is senile.
We can't leave her alone.
Since when?
The Farmland Law.
We lost the land we inherited
from our fathers.
The shock made her crazy, and her
senility began.
She confuses her daughter with
her granddaughter.
They look like each other.
I'm back!
Takeo, meet your uncle and sister.
I know.
Forgive his rudeness.
I would like...
I talked with my wife.
We want Yasuko back.
We shouldn't let you worry about
her marriage.
You owe us nothing.
And it'll cost a lot.
Listen...
Yasuko, my wife and I
are a community bound by the Bomb.
Takamaru...
Please let me take care of her.
Let us keep her.
What do you say?
Even if I came to live here,
I'd be worried about Aunt and Uncle.
Father,
excuse my selfishness,
let me live with them as before.
I guess
I said stupid things.
Forgive me.
Thank you.
Uncle...
Will Aunt agree?
To what?
My staying in your house.
Of course. Why?
Grandma ignores her because of me.
She must be sad.
Don't worry. She's not stupid.
She knows.
Let's go to sleep.
Shigematsu...
A report came.
Your wife had a fit.
It's not that she was seriously
ill, but...
She said not to tell you
but I couldn't be still.
Thank you.
I wasn't asked, but I sent
for Dr. Ando.
He's coming soon.
That's very kind of you.
Don't tell her I sent for
the doctor.
Welcome home.
What's wrong?
What's that?
Yasuko, you must eat it, too.
All of us must eat it.
Eat what? What's that?
A cure-all.
That psychic's?
She's a great psychic.
All right. Lie down.
What happened?
How did it start?
Stay in bed.
Yesterday, Grandma went to the hill.
I followed her,
and suddenly got this dizzy spell.
I threw up.
Threw up?
So I asked the psychic.
She told me the reason.
What is it?
Because I didn't visit the grave
with you.
She said my stubbornness caused
all the trouble.
Your stubbornness?
I was so stubborn I tried to
outdo my sister-in-law.
I tried so hard I had a crooked
mind.
Stubborn and crooked?
I always respected her, though.
You think she was my ex-wife?
Ridiculous!
Hello.
Grandma's fine, doctor.
I heard you fell ill.
Me?
I asked him to come.
I'm all right now
Get examined.
No. I'm all right.
I'll be fine tomorrow.
You!
Don't tell my wife stupid things.
If you come again when I'm home,
I'll make you sorry.
What is it?
A statue of Jizo. I make it.
Good. You've improved at carving.
I have a lot of them. Will you
take a look?
Beautiful! Unique, too.
You can have them all.
No. You gave me one.
But that one and this one make
a pair.
Yuichi, it's nothing.
It'll stop soon.
Cut the engine!
Cut the engine!
Stop! What are you doing?
You're Fumiko, aren't you?
No. Just shut off the engine.
Fumiko, come to Fukuyama.
We want you.
No. I'm Yasuko. Let go of me!
Blast it off!
What? Nut!
What are you doing? Stop!
Take that!
Mission accomplished! Yuichi!
What? Mission accomplished?
Shut off the engine.
An enemy tank destroyed!
Who is it?
Shokichi, how are you?
The Bomb finally got me.
What do you want?
My eyes...
Blinded. I can't see.
Since when?
I don't remember.
Shokichi...
Don't worry about the checking
on Yasuko.
She told everything to the man
herself.
Really?
Yes.
Fine.
It rains a lot!
Dried fish from Tajima.
Thanks.
My wife isn't feeling well,
either.
Is it the Bomb?
She's a hard worker.
She was much healthier than I was.
She has a lot of worries, her
mother-in-law and Yasuko.
Men like him...
Men with narrow minds imagine
things and doubt others.
That's enough.
It seems we caused you trouble.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
It wasn't your fault.
Tell me...
I don't understand.
Why did America use the A-bombs?
When they were winning?
I wonder.
Some say it was to end the war
quickly.
Then why not Tokyo?
Why Hiroshima?
I don't know.
How can we die without knowing
the truth?
I can't die like this, like a
guinea pig.
Can you?
How is she?
I can't say anything definite, but
not very well.
Is it radiation sickness?
No one who was in Hiroshima
must overwork.
I know...
Look, doctor.
Yasuko's diary and mine.
I copied them.
Let any prospective groom read
them first,
so they'll know the black rain
did her no harm.
Please read them,
and write another certificate of
her health.
I see. I will.
Thank you.
You eat aloe?
I think my wife eats it secretly.
That's fine. It's a matter of
will power.
The three of us,
we walked around in a city
full of radioactivity.
So we can get radiation sickness
anytime.
Uncle got it three years ago.
Aunt isn't very well recently.
Pretty tough.
I'll get sick myself anytime.
You won't.
You look fine.
Yuichi, and you?
Usually you seem normal...
Why are you afraid of trucks
and buses?
I don't know.
The sound of engines gives me
a headache.
A lot of American tanks come
roaring, rambling,
breaking trees, trampling on
my buddies.
I run like hell... just run.
The searchlight blinds me.
The commander says,
"Charge!"
"Okazaki, charge!"
Enemy tanks approaching...
A tank comes.
I fal1 in a pit.
The tank passes over me.
It frightens me.
It drives me out of my mind.
Thank you.
Finished? No appetite?
No...
Adjust the time.
Shigematsu,
Shokichi...
Shokichi's...
What's the matter? Kotaro!
What's happening?
I lost two friends in a month.
It discouraged me.
All three victims of indirect
radioactivity died.
My wife and I were exposed to
the blast, yet still survive.
A miracle.
A little too young to move?
They're big enough.
It's all right.
You lost two friends.
You miss them?
What's the matter?
No!
Oh no!
Katayama! Shokichi!
The Bomb!
It's coming!
Sister-in-law, I'm sorry
I couldn't bear a child.
Forgive me.
Forget it. Shigeko!
Pull yourself together!
What?
Did I do something?
You're tired, that's all...
I remember.
Shokichi and Kotaro are dead.
Forget it.
Don't worry. Go to sleep.
I'm no good. I'm useless to
everybody.
I'm sorry for giving you and
Yasuko so much trouble.
What are you saying?
Yasuko...
I'm too ashamed of myself
to see your mother in heaven.
Forgive me.
Forget it.
That's all right, Aunt.
I'm happy enough as it is.
Hello...
A humble gift. For your wife.
Thanks...
I have a request to make.
What is it?
No hard feelings, please.
It's about my son, Yuichi.
I've known him since he was small.
He should go to a better hospital.
Thank you.
My request is about him.
Will Yasuko marry him?
What are you saying?
Yuichi wants to marry her.
He wants Yasuko?
I know it's too much to ask, but
he's been in love with her for
a long time.
I thought I'd ask you.
But he's sick, isn't he?
Only when he hears an engine.
Or maybe...
You thought Yasuko isn't qualified
for a decent marriage?
And you have made it up.
Of course not!
I never thought that. Believe me!
Uncle...
Yes?
Please take it seriously.
What?
Whenever I talk with him, I feel
relaxed.
He's a quiet, nice man.
When I'm alone with him,
I can be frank and honest.
He told me about the war.
I respect him a lot.
Mrs. Tatsu...
Honestly, I'm shocked.
I can't answer now.
I know. Poor people like us
know our limits.
Anyway, you listened to me.
That's good enough.
I'll be going. Good night.
Best wishes to your wife.
She came without a go-between.
It's unusual.
I heard her.
Well?
Do you know how Yasuko feels?
She had many proposals, but she
couldn't be honest.
She couldn't talk about the Bomb.
I think... Dear.
Yes?
Imagine how they...
She and Yuichi talked about
the war and the Bomb...
I pity them.
I've known Yuichi since he
was small.
He was a good boy.
I know.
He never failed to greet me.
Maybe we should approve.
For her sake.
Is that so?
Maybe we should.
I think you're right.
Where's Yasuko?
I haven't seen her.
She's gone.
Did you eat aloe last night?
No. It's too bitter to eat.
Look...
It's Yasuko...
That's it.
It seems she ate a lot of it.
I thought it was you.
Has she been ill for a long time?
Terrible! Look for her.
Look where?
Everywhere.
Come on.
Turn left.
I'm all right.
No pain?
The swelling on her lump is
getting worse.
The Bomb?
It might be. But I wouldn't
say that.
I did all I could.
The trouble is
she believes the Bomb got
her at last.
But it didn't?
I wouldn't say that, either.
Don't give up.
She'll go on like this for
a while.
You should take her home next
week and care for her there.
You mean you're giving up on her?
No. I'm worried about you.
Don't go out.
Stay in bed.
Sleeping beside her
in the hospital has tired you.
You're losing your health.
Especially you, Shigeko.
What if the three of you collapse
together?
Yasuko,
don't worry about the tumor.
Bathe in the tub.
The doctor said so.
Hot enough? Or too hot?
What is it?
Her hair's falling out.
Come on, Shigeko!
Take a rest.
I'll be right back.
Mother!
Shigeko died in a month.
While she fought the pain
she whispered about Yasuko's
marriage.
Yasuko is still alive, but
I wonder for how long.
You'd better take a rest.
Yasuko, lie down.
I'll come again tomorrow.
How do you feel?
All right?
Much better.
That's fine.
The fever?
How's the lump?
Much better.
Your fever isn't gone.
I'll be fine tomorrow.
Take a long rest.
Did the eel work on the tumor?
Yes, miraculously.
I don't feel itchy.
Good...
We treat tumors that way.
Leave it on. They say no trace
will be left.
You'll be able to get married
soon.
Go to sleep.
Disease can be cured with
will power.
Thank you.
By the way,
if you feel better tomorrow,
let's go to the pond.
Good night.
She's patient.
She said nothing,
but she couldn't sleep last night.
Because of the pain.
Where?
All over her body.
She vomited the medicine
I think she should go back
to the hospital.
Not cold?
No. I feel fine today.
Good.
Take care of Grandma after
I die.
If she dies,
sell the house and land,
and make your dowry.
What are you saying?
It's hooked.
The fry are growing fast.
They'll be big when you
get married.
The king!
This is my first time to see it.
What a big carp!
One meter long!
Uncle!
It's longer... much, much
longer!
Splashing water!
Opening its big mouth!
"Charge!"
Five minutes left. Let's go home.
I'm all right.
Good morning!
I'm all right.
Not too tired?
Confronted with new crisis in
Korea,
the U.S. May use,
if necessary, A-bomb against
communist army.
It is hoped, of course,
such situation will not come.
However,
the final decision
depends on the commander-in-chief.
Human beings learn nothing.
They strangle themselves.
Unjust peace is better than
a war of justice.
Why can't they see?
Master! Yasuko's...
Mr. Shizuma!
Sir...
Yuichi will be with Yasuko.
You must stay in bed.
You'll be all right.
You will.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
If a rainbow rises now, a miracle
will happen.
Not an ominous white rainbow,
but a beautiful, colorful one.
Then she'll recover, for sure.
