Fish, love and Maya (wealth)...
...belong to whoever can get
their hands on them.
You already have the fishes
and love in your life.
But, what will you do
about Maya (cash)?
Love means everything to me.
- Oh, very good.
Last night, I met two
girls in the club.
One was black, and the
other was white.
Ivory and Ebony.
Who did you take home?
When you sit down to
play the piano...
...you cannot do it with just
the black or the white key.
We need to play both.
I never understand your
fishing and piano.
Yeah, you only understand the
one-string instrument, Mona.
Okay, okay.
She has two friends.
If...and only if you want, the
four of us can go somewhere.
Hey.
Give me your hand.
Come On. Come on.
What the... Gabbar. Shark?
Shark. - I think he's stuck.
There's a hole in the net.
Hole in the net, means
a hole in the pocket.
We'll have to get Gabbar out...
Captain.
-...or he'll eat up all the fishes.
Captain, you've got
to let it go!
What? You cant just
jump in like that!
Captain its not wise for one
guy to fight with the shark.
Yeah you're right.
How about two?
Lets call for help
Don't fight the shark!
Captain, you better let that go.
Are you OK?
Thank God.
I really like that cap.
You OK shetji?
Yeah. I'm ok now.
Man, you are making
me crazy now!
Did you see the shark?
Settle down, Shetji. Misfortune
is just around the corner for you.
What do you mean to say, that
I should retire. Right?
You need money to retire. Do you
want to sell crabs all your life?
Then, suggest me something else.
It's no use catching these
small fishes, Shetji.
You need to go after
something big.
Excuse me sir, signature please.
Shit!
Go after something huge. -
Huge? Meaning?
Let's look for some treasure.
Treasure?
If we do find it, we'll be
rolling in money. Life will be great.
And what after that?
I've no dearth in my life. I've
a bungalow, a job, Mona.
What do you have?
I've Liya, Diya, Jonaliya,
Lelliya...
...and the lastest
recruit, Nadiya.
Nadiya.
Your court is about
to commence, sir.
Okay, let's meet in
the boxing ring.
- Ok
- Lets go
Not if you're too tired.
Shut up.
Come on Shetji.
Countdown has begun, Aarav.
You cannot win today.
Today is my day. Come on.
It might be your day, Shetji.
But the 100 dollars in
your pocket is mine.
That's why, you will
lose Shetji.
Come on.
Come on Shetji, Come on.
Hey man, Mind the face.
I've to go on dinner with
Mona in the evening.
Forget it, Shetji you're
just playing around.
You're not serious.
Aarav, I'm fighting.
No no
You're so tough, what can I do?
Shetji, I wasn't born
yesterday. Get that.
I know, let's change our
bet. Three punches.
You can punch me thrice,
anywhere.
Just, don't hit me on
my family jewels.
If I fall down, I'll give you 100
dollars otherwise, you can give me.
You will die.
Shetji, don't make excuses.
You'll lose Aarav.
The day I lose, I'll die Shetji.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Ready. Hit me.
Come on, come on, come on
Second one.
Hit me baby, one more time.
Come on, the third one.
Give me your best shot.
Looks like shetji has
lost his Jewels
Sorry, Shetji...I didn't say
that I won't hit back.
Ten, nine... six...
two... one. I won.
You will never reform, Aarav.
Come on Shetji Get
up. Give me a hug.
What ever you say, Today you
cheated to win, Aarav.
Here's your money.
Keep it. I'll take it when
you play seriously.
Keep it, it's yours.
Of course it's mine, Shetji.
Its fate was decided, the moment
you placed it for bet.
Keep it, I'll take double
the next time.
Keep it, keep it I took
it out of your purse...
...when you were taking a bath.
Come on, Shetji give
me another one.
Take it tomorrow. Or else, Mona
will have to pay for the dinner.
Tell me something, Shetji.
Do you plan to stay like
this all your life?
Bloody poor mentality, have
some, need some more.
Tell me something, when are
you raising my salary?
If you're ready to risk a gamble,
Then I'll have to ask you for salary.
I never understand
what you blabber.
Lady In Blue.
Don't ever say it again.
Wow Shetji, why don't you
bring this anger...
...in the ring as well, so that
I'll enjoy beating you.
Hey, you've gotten all serious.
I'll get the car. Come soon.
I pray for you my friend, that you
never have to face this anger ever.
I like winning, Shetji.
But not easily.
So shape up, dude.
To stay in my league, you
need to work hard.
Such a big business,
money you're lucky.
Business doesn't run by itself.
You need brains to manage it.
...that you can see your entire
life in front of you.
All the twist and turns...
Speed-breakers.
And in the end, its all
about one thing...
...and that is...money
at the finish-line.
Hey, Officer...
Yo.
Your seatbelt.
My apologies sir. Smart
son of a bitch
I never break the law.
Enough of fooling around Sarkar. Now
please drop somebody is waiting for me.
Somebody or someone special.
Seem forlorn, seem regained.
Like a shadow, lost in sleep.
Seem regained.
Let's go Sara rara re.
Seem forlorn.
Let's go Sara rara re.
The heart's unrestrained
today.
The water's aflame.
The heart's restless.
Let's go Sara rara re.
There's a storm in my breath.
What a wonderful dream.
The heart's restless.
Let's go Sara rara re.
The sun is missing.
Two bodies lying on the sand.
But they are one shadow.
Let's go Sara rara re.
Let's go Sara rara re...your
obsession.
Let's go Sara rara re.
Where will we find peace?
The heart's unrestrained
today.
The water's aflame.
The heart's restless.
Let's go Sara rara re.
There's a storm in my breath.
What a wonderful dream.
The heart's restless.
Let's go Sara rara re.
The evening's setting.
It's making a mistake.
Why are you leaving so soon?
The evening's setting.
It's making a mistake.
Why are you leaving so soon?
Flies on air.
Doesn't stop or look back.
Why is time in a hurry?
Let's go Sara rara re.
Seem forlorn, seem regained.
Like a shadow, lost in sleep.
Seem forlorn, seem regained.
Like a shadow, lost in sleep.
It's so beautiful...
Just like a dream.
But one of my dreams is
yet to be fulfilled.
The Oceanography Marine
lnstitute one.
To preserve marine life.
But that'll require a lot
of money, isn't it?
Shall we ask Aarav?
Aarav is very rich, but I won't
ask him for the money.
Looks like...your dream will
never be fulfilled.
I'll keep catching fish, and
you'll keep cooking it.
So what? We'll be together na?
Any news about Sam?
No. Don't know where he is.
So, you're Samir.
Actually, people call me Sam.
But you...you can call
me whatever you want.
I'm Nikki.
But you...can call me Nikki.
I've heard you're
a champion racer.
Yes. That I am.
I'll believe it...only if you
defeat our star rider.
HOT! Guess this is
your lucky race Sam!
Race? With him?
Is this a joke, Nikki? Please.
Such attitude. That's a problem.
Of course there is,
But, not for me...for
your star rider.
You need better competition,
right champion?
Who is that?
Prize money. Now, What
do you say now?
I say, I don't like
looking back.
You start ahead, I'll be with
you shortly after a coffee.
I'll wait, you can have
your... coffee.
I like your style.
Best of luck guys. Winner
takes it all.
Star rider.
Star rider?
That's all?
I thought you said,
winner takes all.
8 o'clock tomorrow, pick
me up for dinner.
Well done. I've a job for you.
Would you like to do it?
No way, man.
If the pay is good, l
can think about it.
Take care big guy.
Hey Nikki, I feel terrible
for your bosses loss.
My condolences to him
Not everyone is lucky
to win from Gulshan.
You're lucky.
Luck? What is luck?
I believe on myself,
and not my fate.
Winning is a habit.
Anyway, tell me one thing,
who is this Gulshan?
What does he do?
The less you know about Gulshan,
the better for you.
The price for the job
is 50,000 dollars.
Cool, I'll do it.
Wouldn't you like to know
what you've to do?
What difference does it make?
50,000 dollars is a lot of money.
I could use the money, Nikki.
For what?
Future. Our future.
We hardly met 12 hours ago.
And, you're thinking
about our future.
I've been thinking for
the past 12 hours.
You just have to say yes.
Not everything has to be said.
I'll drink to that.
Yes, Samir Singh.
I've been waiting for you.
Sam.
Okay. So, Sam what
else can you do...
...other than riding bikes?
Gulshan, did you call
me for a job...
...or to find out about
my personal life.
Guys, relax.
Sam's good. He can do
our job. Trust me.
I trust him.
It's heavy. What's in it?
Chance. Take it.
The price for the job
is 50,000 dollars.
And with the delay
of every minute...
...you lose money.
You've 30 minutes.
- I just need 15.
Nikki, meet me at home
in half an hour.
Have a bottle of champagne
on ice.
If you miss me, you can call me.
You're losing money, Sam.
29 minutes, and counting.
So hurry up.
Trust me Gulshan, I'm losing
much more than that.
Hurry up.
Hello.
- Hey, already missing me.
Just checking.
I've taken your guarantee.
I hope you're focused
on your work.
Until you're focused on me...
...how can I focus on anything
else, Nikki?
I told you, I'm just checking.
Checking what? I left just
five minutes ago.
What can happen in five minutes?
Bike number 9285.
The biggest intoxication
in the world. Risk.
What's that sound?
- Siren. Freeway police.
I think someone is about
to get in trouble.
Stop, stop, Stop the bike.
- Oh No.
- What's wrong?
I just found out, who the
police are after...
...and it's your boyfriend.
They are after you.
They're after me, and they'll
stay that way.
Sam, disconnect the call
and get out of there.
What if they catch
you with the bag?
Don't worry, sweetheart. I'm
no mood to die today.
Try to cut him off
from that side.
STOP! STOP! Stop your
bike. Go! Go ahead
We need back up. He take Rama 3.
Suspect on red ducati
riding on Rama 3
Any officer in that
area, cut him off.
Hello.
Should I call you Samir
Singh or Sam?
You've shortened your own name.
Now I'll have to shorten
your life.
Gulshan.
Right. My men called you...
...and you disconnected the
call. That wasn't right.
Actually, my ears are
very sensitive...
...and your men, don't speak
properly. So go figure.
We don't abuse strangers.
It's used only amongst kin.
Anyways, if you still want
to stay close to me...
...then return my bag.
Or else, the price.
50 million dollars.
50 million dollars? What
was in that bag?
It was my bag, so I will
decide the price for it.
You're lucky Sam, very lucky.
Often, people hear their
death approaching...
...before hearing my voice.
It's all in the family.
I'm giving you two days.
50 million dollars, or...
Are you okay?
Nothing's okay, Nikki.
The police are after me, and
so are Gulshan's men.
They blew up my bike.
Threatened to kill me. But
he doesn't know me...
You don't know him, Sam.
If he has threatened you, then
he will surely kill you.
So what?
He won't get his money
back by killing me.
That's not the point. Their
business runs on fear.
And to maintain this fear,
they can kill anyone.
Sam do you know a place where
Gulshan cannot find you?
There's one place, Nikki.
Bahamas.
My brother lives there.
That's perfect. Gulshan will
never be able to find you.
I'll tell him you've run away to
the Philippines, Mauritius...
Let him keep looking.
Won't you come along?
Not now.
Otherwise, who will tell you
what's going on here?
But... -You go.
I'll join you as soon as this
problem gets solved. Okay?
Sam.
Take care.
I'll miss you.
Me too.
Brother.
How are you? -Fine.
Fine?
Yes. And you?
Nothing's wrong with me.
I'm like I've always been.
And I'll always be.
That means, I'll have to run
away from home again.
Forgive me, Brother.
I really missed you.
I missed you too Sam.
Please forgive me.
Where were you?
Sorry, it was a mistake.
If you make the same
mistake again...
...I'll beat you wherever
I find you.
Do people here still spend
their day fishing...
...and nights, by reading
about fishing.
No, I mean have you started
clubbing partying or still...
What's wrong with that?
It's been just a day
you've been here...
...and you already have a problem
with the people here.
Come on, tonight I'll take you
to the most elite club here.
Heavy metal, man.
How long will you
stay like this?
What's the use of reforming?
Look at you. Look at
your condition.
What good did it do to you?
Hi. -Hi.
You should've told me that we're
going to have a guest.
I could've done some
reservations.
Guest. What guest?
Why just him?
Even I wouldn't have
recognised him...
...if I had met him without you.
Hey, is that Sam?
- Aarav brother.
- Sam, how are you doing?
Keep the brother bit for him,
you can call me Aarav.
That girl is really hot.
I can't see her face properly.
Trust me bro, she's really hot.
Okay. -Why are you spoiling him?
I'm not spoiling him,
I'm telling him.
You shouldn't spend your life
with just one girl, like you...
You know, you should've variety.
What brother Sagar?
Unless of course...it's Mona
sister-in-law... -Mona aunty.
Your girlfriend will be
the sister-in-law.
And, were you born this way...
...or do you have to practise?
- No, It's how I am.
- He won't change.
- Yes, he won't change.
I like it.
Listen, now I'll show you how
to get the attention...
...of a exclusive girl,
in an exclusive club.
Hey.
Yes.
- Forget it.
- Still acts childish.
He'll surely land in trouble.
Couple of beers, No. 6 please.
Hey.
Hey, that's Kylie Minogue.
Hey idiot, I don't work here.
Sorry, my bad.
Don't let it happen again.
Well, I know you
don't work here.
How else am I supposed to bring
you away from those guys?
And, why would you
want to do that?
Because I noticed you looking
at my direction.
Sagar will surely get
beaten up today.
Baby, there's a giant clock
across where you were sitting.
I was just keeping time.
Every man who sees me wants
to hold my hand.
And be the one who gets
me to say, Oh I do!
They swear eternal undying
devotion, yes they swear.
That they will love me
forever, love me true.
But I don't need
a shining star.
And I don't want
to be rescued.
No neither frog, nor
charming prince.
Nor my summers barbequed.
I want chiggy-wiggy
with you boy.
I want chiggy-wiggy

Free is the way to live it up.
Free to go.
Free if I don't want
to give it up.
Free to groove.
The dance floor's where
I want to be.
Free to move.
White picket fences
frighten me.
I want chiggy-wiggy
with you boy.
I want chiggy-wiggy
with you boy.
I want chiggy-wiggy
with you, fella.
I want chiggy-wiggy

The knight wishes to be at
the damsel's disposal.
The killer attitude and
this fatal exhibition.
Come chiggy-wiggy with

Come chiggy-wiggy with

Come chiggy-wiggy with

You can call it evening.
Whatever you say is true.
You can call me anything

Chiggy-wiggy, some
chiggy-wiggy.
Listen to my heart.
Come chiggy-wiggy, let's
do chiggy-wiggy.
Why worry about tomorrow?
Nikki, it's me Sam.
I've been trying to contact
you for so long.
Listen, I'm in the Bahamas...
And I wish you were here.
Miss you. Call me soon.
Or better, come here. Bye.
Wow. Ducati 999.
You like it mate? -0-100
in 3.6 seconds.
Like it? She's my dream.
And this is yours.
No, no Aarav...brother
always says...
...never accept a gift that
you cannot return.
But, whenever I give
someone a gift...
...I make sure, I get
100% more in return.
From whom, God? -Oh, no.
To whomever I give
the gift. You.
Come on, you're joking.
I'm not joking I'm really
serious about it.
And anyway, your brother Sagar...
...can become rich easily,
and...you know that.
You know it very well.
And, don't forget
your friend then.
Till then, enjoy your ride.
I'll find another ride.
Hey... -Hello, excuse
me can I ride you?
Excuse me. -I mean, to say
can you ride me home.
Aarav, since when did you
bother asking? Hop in.
Enjoy your ride Sam.
Take care. Have a fun.
Sam, what is this mess?
Maybe, I should be asking
you that Brother.
What a mess?
Everyone knows that the
treasure story is true.
I've told you before, and
I'm saying it again.
It's all a lie.
You're lying to me, Brother.
You're hiding something from me.
If I had found the treasure...
...wouldn't I have told
you about it?
Would I have hidden it from you?
Hey Sam, where did you
get this ring from?
I bought it for Mona.
And, by the way it's
bad manners.
Never peek into my stuff again.
Why Brother, are you hiding
something else from me?
Why don't you just admit it?
You found the treasure.
Listen Sam, this story is fake.
And, many have lost
their lives...
...because of this fake story.
I'm not joking. -I'm
not laughing either.
Forget it, go sleep.
We've to go on Aarav's
boat tomorrow, okay?
Hey Aarav. -Yes.
Does this bike work, or...
Because I really don't see the
point of a bike on a boat.
Whether the bike works or
not, your mind should.
Aarav always keeps his
bike on the boat.
To look around the
close-by islands.
That's Aarav for you.
He's got two of everything.
Well said ma'am.
Two of everything.
Blue.
Blue. -Fearless eyes.
Blue. -Instinctive attitude.
Blue. -In these heart...
Blue. -Are flawless loyalty.
Blue. -In the depths
of the ocean.
Blue. -Are vast treasures.
Blue. -The depths
of the heart.
Blue. -Are enormous sagas.
Blazing flames.
The fuming currents.
Colourful sparks.
The gleaming drops of rain.
The colour of fidelity.
Filled in the ocean.
At times it's red like blood.
At times it the colour blue.
Fearless eyes.
Instinctive attitude.
In these heart...
Are flawless loyalty.
Fearless eyes.
Instinctive attitude.
Are flawless loyalty.
Are flawless loyalty.
Fearless eyes.
Blue.
Blue. -Fearless eyes.
Blue. -Instinctive attitude.
Blue. -In these heart...
Blue. -Are flawless loyalty.
Having a drink here is a
different experience.
People drink to lose
their senses.
But if you lose your
senses here...
The biggest intoxication in the
world is risk. -You're mad.
Your relation with Mona
is a risk as well.
She must have her own
dreams, her wishes...
She won't wait for
you all her life.
She will have to.
Because, right now there's
no money in my bank.
There's just one solution
for that problem.
Blue.
Lady in Blue.
It still sleeping in the depths of
the ocean, along it's the treasure.
Just for you and me.
What are you thinking, Shetji?
Do you want to spend all
your life at the shore...
...and gather shells?
There are many divers
on this island.
Why don't you go with
someone else?
What's so special about me?
There's something special.
You're Aadesh Singh's son.
Aadesh Singh knows more about
this ocean than anyone else.
And the only one, to
get his hands...
...on the treasure
of Lady in Blue.
What do you know about
Lady in Blue?
1947, lndia achieved
independence.
The British government
decided to return...
...a big portion of the wealth
which they plundered from lndia.
July 1949, this wealth was
being ferried back...
...on lndian Navy Ship
Lady lN Blue.
There was a ferocious storm...
...and the ship sunk
somewhere here.
Along with all the treasures.
Nice story.
But it's still incomplete.
The real story is that...
...the ship wasn't caught
up in any storm.
Instead, the captain's
intentions turned bad.
He sunk the ship, and hid
the treasure somewhere.
On October 1949, he was
court-marshalled
That captain...is still alive.
People also say that your
father Aadesh Singh...
...found a part of that treasure.
And after that, he left
this country...
...along with some
young girl here.
Leaving you two behind,
in a miserable state.
Aadesh Singh played a nice game.
That's wrong.
He didn't find any treasure.
People are wrong,
and so are you.
Understand one thing, Aarav.
Nothing in this world, can
provoke me to go there.
I don't want that treasure.
My feet are on the ground...
...and that's where they're
going to be.
Someday, if I pull the ground
from beneath your feet.
My heart says, you'll get
the treasure Shetji.
And whenever Aarav says
something, it happens.
Cheers.
Sagar.
Come here. -Come.
I can't.
Sagar, It was just for
a little while.
Why didn't you dance with
me? It would've been fun.
You know, I'm dancing in the
parade after such a long time.
Why aren't you dancing with me?
I'm thinking about
Aarav. -Aarav.
You always think about Aarav.
Why don't you think
about yourself?
Or think about me.
It won't do you any harm.
I'm not in the mood.
Sagar. What's wrong now?
He's been living on this island
for so many years.
He has no friends or family
except for me.
Though he's rich, why
does he befriend me?
So, what do you want to say?
Aarav has befriended
you for a reason.
Don't you think it's a
bit too much, Sagar?
We're talking about Aarav.
Nothing is too much.
People like to sit in the dark
either when they're in love...
...or he's worried. -There
can be another reason.
What? -When there's a power cut.
Have you done something wrong?
Because you're not
that emotional...
...to miss me and come
here to meet me.
Where were for five years?
What were you doing?
I don't know anything.
How can I believe that you've
come here just to meet me?
If you have a problem with
me staying here...
...you can say so. I'll leave.
Were you happy staying
away from me?
I wasn't sad. -Anyway. You've
come here after five years.
How can I let you go?
Don't tell me if you
don't want to.
But there's one thing l
want to tell you, Sam.
I'm there for you.
Always have. -Yes.
Nikki.
Hello, Nikki
Hello, Nikki.
Hello, Nikki. Hello.
Why don't you talk
to me some times?
Gulshan, where is Nikki?
A small price for
befriending you.
She had to pay for it.
Anyway, you'll soon get
to meet her soon.
And, when you do, say sorry.
The question is not
where Nikki is.
The question is, where are
you at the moment...
...and where am l?
Move.
Out of my way. Move.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Aarav? What are you doing here?
Who were they?
Why were they following you?
I... -What?
What can I tell you?
And that's the reason, why
I had to leave Bangkok.
I thought they'll never
find me here.
But they've come here.
Now, if I don't repay their
money they'll kill me.
Did you tell you brother
about this? -No, Aarav.
I know what brother will
say. -I know him.
Get out.
Get out of my sight.
I told you it's no use.
Wait, Sam. Let me talk.
What's this, Sagar?
Why are you behaving like this?
He's worth that.
He's responsible for
his own mistakes.
I cannot do anything.
Sethji, this is no time for
Moral Science lectures.
If you keep up this act
of honesty, he'll die.
Anything is possible.
We all have to help him.
Try and understand, Sethji.
We've to help him.
Where will I get $50 million
for him from?
If I had liquid cash,
I would've given him.
But unfortunately, I don't.
It'll take me some time.
Aarav, I've never taken money
from you, and I never will.
You saved my brother's
life, and that's all.
What are you saying, Sethji?
Sethji, we're friends.
Stop this.
Stop this nonsense
of friendship.
They won't wait any longer.
If they don't get their
money, I'm dead.
Do you hear that? I'm dead.
I was fortunate to
survive this time.
We'll have to do something.
Sethji. -What should we do?
What should we do?
Do you have a plan?
Yes, Brother. I have a plan.
And we should've implemented
it long back.
Lady in Blue.
Sethji.
Just great, Sethji.
I kept asking you for
so many months.
But you didn't tell me.
You kept lying to me.
Why, Sethji?
Why?
I'm sure, Sethji, you must
have a good reason for it.
But for now, we have to go into
the sea, and get that treasure.
And help Sam.
And after that, guys
we all will be rich.
We'll be rich. We'll be happy.
Sethji. Let's go.
Let's go, Sethji.
Let's go.
Relax. Feel at home.
At least for the time being.
Don't worry. You're safe here.
I'll try to arrange for the
money as soon as possible.
No, Aarav...I can't trouble
you anymore.
If I stay here, they'll
eventually find me.
I'll have to leave this island.
Don't be stupid.
How long will you run,
and where can you run?
They can find you from any
corner of the world.
What do you think? It'll be
difficult for them to find you?
They'll find you like this.
What else should I do?
Nothing. I'll see Sethji
once again.
Try to convince him.
If he agrees, we'll leave today.
We'll leave for the treasure
hunt today.
Brother will never agree.
There's no other option.
- There is.
Can't we get the treasure?
I roughly know where it is.
And you've the equipment.
We can do this, Aarav.
Grow up, man. Just grow up.
Look there.
There. What do you think is
the colour of the ocean?
Blue? Right?
Wrong? It's red.
The colour of blood.
Many have lost their lives.
Your brother is the only one...
...who can get the treasure
back safe and sound.
Because he knows the ocean
like the back of his hand.
And anyway, never
try to go inside.
You'll end up losing your life.
But, I know him, Aarav.
Brother will never agree. Never.
He will.
A man can run from himself,
but not his fate.
Relax, Sagar.
Don't worry.
We'll get Sam out of this
problem somehow.
We'll get him out of this mess.
Surprise.
Mike...
Attitude.
Sagar stop, what are you doing?
What should we do?
We can solve every problem
by talking.
Can we talk?
Are you done talking?
Now let my gun talk.
What happened?
Didn't she like Hong
Kong's hello?
Stop your nonsense.
And tell me what you want.
Sam. Your brother.
What do you want with Sam?
Ask him where are
my $50 million?
You can do anything you want...
...but you can't get
your hands on Sam.
Sagar, the gas cylinder.
24 hours. $50 million, or Sam.
I've an idea.
I need a gun.
I'm going to kill them.
Sam, neither do you nor
we know who they are.
What's their strength?
How powerful are they?
Do we have any other
choice, Aarav?
They killed Nikki.
They'll kill Mona as well.
If we don't do anything...
...we'll all be lying
beneath the sea.
I've to go. -Sam...
Sarkar, remember you said...
What if the ground below
the feet is pulled away?
It has happened, Sarkar.
Sethji, only one lady
can save us now.
Lady in Blue.
Brother, there's
no other option.
Brother, what's so scary
about that place...
...that's scarier than death?
Dad's death.
Dad's death?
Because of me.
'Dad was a marine
archaeologist.'
'He was one of the best divers.'
'Finding ships that had sunk
wasn't just his profession...'
'...but also his hobby.'
'That day, when he set out
on a similar mission...'
'...I came along with him.'
'Paradise Cove.'
'A unique place, where the
land and the sea unite...'
'...and they don't.'
'Death at every step.'
'Jaws of death.'
'There we saw another
sunken ship.'
'Lady in Blue.'
'l had heard stories
about from my dad.'
'And, it was right
in front of us.'
'Suddenly dad found a ring,
and he kept it.'
'Just then I saw a gold jewel.'
'And I scurried towards it.'
'ln haste, I collided against
a metal beam.'
'And it fell down.'
'l would've been caught under
it, but dad saved me.'
'And, got caught under
it himself.'
'We tried to get it off,
but were unsuccessful.'
'He called me close, and by
showing me the oxygen level...'
'...and asked me to go back
before the oxygen level drops.'
'He gave me that ring,
and made me swear...'
'...to never tell anyone
about this treasure.'
'l couldn't help dad,
or save him.'
'My single mistake...one
mistake...'
'...proved fatal for dad.'
'l never returned to that
place again. Never.'
That treasure killed dad.
I couldn't save him.
I'm sorry, Sethji.
You endured the sorrow of your
dad's death all your life.
And for that you were
not responsible.
But, you can do something
about...
...what's going to happen
with Sam and Mona.
You can save them.
We've 24 hours.
I forgot You.
How could l?
When did I part ways from You?
Oh Lord.
Should I laugh, or
should I cry?
What mistake did I make?
What sin did I commit?
My Lord.
Lord, if this is Your will...
Is it my test, or is
it my punishment?
Is this the end, or is
this the beginning?
My Lord.
I forgot You.
How could l?
When did I part ways from You?
Oh Lord.
Dear Lord.
Dear Lord.
One can run from himself.
One can only run
from Your grace.
I've made this wish
after a long time...
But it's the first time.
Dear Lord.
Dear Lord.
Lord, if this is Your will...
Is it my test, or is
it my punishment?
Is this the end, or is
this the beginning?
Oh Lord.
Dear Lord.
Dear Lord.
Three golden rules of diving.
Never stop breathing.
Always be calm.
And always stay together.
If we stay together,
we'll be alive.
How u feeling Sethji?
Sethji, everything okay?
I'm fine. Where's Sam?
Ram, Laxman, Hanuman.
Actually, I'm a little
curious type of a guy.
I wondered where you'd
get $50 million from...
...and came to see it myself.
Your 24 hours aren't over yet.
Whatever your name is.
Gulshan.
So Hanuman, you've found
the golden Lanka...
...beneath the sea.
But, how did you forget that
I still have your Sita?
If...
You will get your
money, Gulshan.
Actually, I've changed my mood.
And intentions, too.
And now, I want that lady
in exchange of this lady.
Fair enough.
And I hope you guys don't
mind a little company.
Actually, these days you
cannot trust anyone.
What now? -Let's introduce
them to Gabbar.
So, come on guys. Hit
the waves. -Come on.
You won't escape.
What happens to me
is not a concern.
The real concern is, if they
don't get the treasure...
...what will happen to you.
What will happen to you?
Mona, get the anchor. -Okay.
Where are Sam and Aarav?
He and Aarav are taking
care of Gulshan's men.
Oh, really.
Hi, Sam.
Where is your over-confident,
over smart...
...and over-unlucky friend,
Aarav Malhotra?
What did he think?
He could double-cross me, and
take the entire treasure?
Listen, I and your brother's
friend, Aarav...
...are old business partners.
He gave me a job to make
you flee and come here.
And I did that honestly.
But he cheated.
You, and me.
He didn't tell me about
the treasure.
He wants to keep all the
treasure for himself.
I won't let this happen.
Boat for the bungalow.
That's okay.
Hi, Mr. Malhotra.
Nice to see you alive.
Remember me.
I did so much for you.
I got Sam trapped in Bangkok.
'The job's done.'
Kidnapped Mona.
But you deceived me.
We do the work, and you
take the reward.
Bad manners.
He's lying, Sethji.
Listen to me, Sethji.
Sethji, he's talking nonsense.
What's wrong with you, man?
Okay. Okay.
I can explain.
Mayday. Mayday.
Come in Coast Guard.
We need help.
You took advantage of
my friendship. Why?
There's a hurricane heading
towards your area.
You like winning don't you.
But you won't know what it feels
like to lose in friendship.
We request you to leave
you position...
...and head towards
the nearest coast.
You betrayed me.
Why.
I would always let you win
the boxing matches.
And you would consider
it your victory.
Believe me, Sethji.
You really were speaking
the truth.
I really did lose today.
Remember what I said that day?
'The day I lose, I'll
kill myself Sethji.'
Don't worry, Sam.
Nobody would've ever harmed you.
That's it, Sethji.
Today is my last day.
Aarav, stop.
I'm sorry, Sethji
I've to do this.
I'm sorry for everything.
We should go back, Sagar.
There's a storm heading
towards us.
It's impossible for Aarav to
survive in this stormy sea.
We won't ever come back here.
Because every time I came
here, I lost a kin.
Hello. -Sethji.
Aarav, is that you?
How could you forget,
Sethji...I've two of everything.
I always have a plan B.
'Aarav, stop.'
The bike. Remember, Sethji?
I used it to plan my escape.
With its help, I kept breathing
for a long time
You thought I have no chance
of surviving in this storm.
And you left.
But no, I survived.
After that, I did the rest.
Lady in Blue.
The ship that took your
dad from you...
...and our family name,
and honour.
It finished everything.
A traitor...Captain
Jagat Malhotra.
My grandfather.
And I'm his grandson,
Aarav Malhotra.
'After hearing all
the arguments...'
'...and taking them into
consideration...'
'...the jury finds Captain
Jagat Malhotra guilty.'
'Deserting his sinking ship,
the Lady in Blue...'
'...and in the greed for the
country's property...'
'...Captain Jagat Malhotra has
proved he's a traitor.'
'Taking that in consideration,
the jury orders...'
'...seizure of all the medals and
recommendation letters...'
'...for his esteemed services.'
'And court-martial's Captain
Jagat Malhotra from the lndian Navy.'
Captain Jagat Malhotra
was your grandfather.
Why didn't you tell us?
For six years...
- I was six years old.
I've been hearing it since then.
'Aarav belongs to a
traitor family.'
I passed the Naval Cadet Corps...
...but was never commissioned.
When I asked, I found out...
...that our family was
blacklisted in lndia.
And then I decided that I'd find
the treasure of the Lady in Blue.
And then I found out,
that only one man...
...can take me to that
treasure. You.
I found out about you, and
then befriended you.
And I tried to convince you
to go to the treasure.
But you kept refusing.
And you know the rest
of the story.
Sethji, I could do it
only because of you.
But I had to clear
my family's name.
I apologise to you
for my mistake.
Some mistakes cannot
be forgiven, Aarav.
You set out to clear
your family's name...
...and tried to ruin someone
else's family.
That wasn't a part of my
plan, Mona. Believe me.
I had no intentions
to hurt you all.
May I please speak to Sam?
I don't want to talk
to you, Aarav.
Sam, not even with me
Nikki.
Nikki, you're alive...
Oh, of course. You're
with Aarav.
Aarav is my husband.
I'm sorry I deceived you.
But it wasn't about you.
It was about my family's honour.
Can you forgive me?
Sethji, legally whoever
finds the treasure...
...gets 20% from the government.
I've deposited all the money
into your bank account.
Now you've become a
real Sethji (rich).
Congratulations, Sethji.
What do you mean, Aarav?
Sethji, please no Moral
Science lectures now.
It's your right. You
should get it.
Buy a nice boat, a big one.
Build Mona's institute.
And let Sam live just like
this, comfortably.
Don't worry about us, Aarav.
Think about yourself.
It's not over yet.
Sethji, typical Sethji.
We live carefree.
Why shouldn't we
live carefree?
We live carefree.
Why shouldn't we
live carefree?
We live carefree.

This is our wealth.
Let me fulfill my wish.
And all my desires.
There is no restriction
on me. I'm carefree.
I'm like an ember in obsession
and solace.
I'm oblivious to merriment
and punishment.
Know that I am in love.
The stars of the sky.
Then we'll meet.
We'll do it. No, we'll do it.
We live life to the fullest.
We wander without any worry.
We meet others heartily.
We have a merry gait.
We are in the fragrant orchid.
We are in the twinkling stars.
We are in the flaming inferno.
We are in the stirring breeze.
This carefree...this carefree.
This carefree...this carefree.
