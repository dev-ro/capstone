- Victory over France!
Victory over France!
West front surrenders!
Victory over France!
- The French are defeated!
-Good morning, judge fromm.
-Yeah!
-There's nothing
for you today.
-That is what I call
good news.
I wish you a nice day
just the same.
-Your honor.
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!
-So what's the news?
-A letter from the military
postal service. Typed.
-Who?
Quangel's son.
- Herr quangel, for you.
-Something has happened
to the boy?
-Those liars!
-Anna.
-You're to blame.
You and your damn war!
You and your damn fuhrer!
-Anna.
-Please..
Leave me alone.
-It's me, Eva.
 Frau rosenthal?
-Anything from my husband?
Thank you, Eva.
-What do you need?
-I don't need much.
As always.
-Morning.
- Frau quangel, how much butter
do you need?
 Half a pound? Your usual?
You have milk and eggs.
Now how much butter do you need?
-I..
- Oh, come on!
-Come along.
-Hurry up.
- Frau quangel?
I'll take you home.
-I'll be straight home
from work.
-Hey, quangel.
What's the hurry?
Is something wrong?
We're going to get rich.
A victory over France.
Know what that means?
We're gonna be the richest
country in the whole world!
-So, in the next few weeks
we will have
destroyed england
and ended the war.
And since the troops
on the front
have been so victorious
 it's time that those of us
 at home do our duty as well.
The fuhrer wants
to increase production.
He expects productivity
to rise by 30 percent
in three months
and to double that
within the next half a year.
 The fuhrer's wish
 is our command.
We will now receive
any proposals
about how to reach this goal.
 Sieg heil!
- Sieg heil!
-Workers, does anyone
have anything to say?
 Yes, foreman quangel?
-To increase productivity,
additional machines
must be installed
and a few shirkers laid off.
-What are you talking about?
 Who are those shirkers?
-Some can't keep up
with the work pace.
Others don't want to.
Talking politics,
skipping work.
Some men here are good at it.
Very good.
-How dare you talk
like that, quangel?
You're not in the party!
How dare you discredit
members of the party!
-Quangel only thinks
of himself.
Do you donate anything
to the winter relief fund?
And to the fuhrer?
-Germany has taken
my only son.
Yesterday, I was informed
he died in combat.
For you. For the fuhrer.
I ask you, dolfuss.
What more can a man donate
than his child?
- Anna!
 Anna, we have visits to make!
 The Nazi women's league
 is waiting for you!
 Heil Hitler, Anna!
Where were you?
-We're late!
-Now, come on.
It's time to go.
We'll wait downstairs.
-I'll change. I'll change.
-So, first
that frau gerda kleinschmidt.
Then there's
a frau else wernicke
who just lives around
the corner, and then..
Ah, listen to this,
Claire gehrich.
-Ah, she's the wife
of obersturmbannfuhrer gehrich.
You have to be really diplomatic
if you visit her.
-Should I cross her out?
-No, no, we can't do that.
We all have to do our part
but, uh, perhaps not today.
We have to be in good shape
for someone like that.
 What a nice place.
- What can I do for you?
-Your husband?
-Yes.
-Your husband's
fighting in Poland
isn't he, frau kleinschmidt?
He's risking his life,
day after day for his people
and his fatherland while you are
having a good time in Berlin.
-Aren't you ashamed?
- But I..
 But..
Nobody understands.
I'm so worried for him.
I'm so worried, but..
-Knock it off!
Get back to work.
Don't think this will save you
from the front.
I'm not going to lie.
I know you did it on purpose.
You understand?
If the doorbell rings,
don't open the door.
 For anyone.
- Otto?
-I'm writing.
-To who?
- I don't know.
I'm writing cards.
Cards that tell the truth.
People will read these cards.
 They will pass them on.
-Cards?
You're scribbling cards?
What is that supposed to do?
Why are you
writing like that?
-I'm disguising
my handwriting.
Let me do it. Please.
-It isn't even locked.
-What if she screams?
-She won't scream.
- My stupid wife
 takes food to her.
- The old Jew.
She hauled all her stuff up here
after they burned her shop.
-She's hiding.
Calm down.
- Papa, upstairs.
- Let's go. Quickly.
-What are you doing here?
Barkhausen, what are you doing
in this apartment?
- Herr persicke..
Neighbor, we can share.
-It's frau rosenthal.
-Please, it's not my fault.
-Out.
-Look for the money.
-I'm sorry.
-There's no need to be.
 You can stay with us.
 This is too dangerous for you.
-Ssh..
-Judge fromm?
-Come with me, madame.
Quickly.
They'll be back.
Ssh, be quiet. Come in.
My deceased daughter's room.
No one will look for you here.
Try to get used to it.
Go to sleep
and tomorrow morning
you will listen
exactly to what I say.
Tomorrow.
Goodnight, frau rosenthal.
-Is she back in her apartment?
No.
-I'm coming with you.
You can't stop me.
You can't stop me.
-They'll hang you.
They hang women, too.
-Of course they do.
-You only go up
to the building.
I go inside. I place the card.
I'll be right back.
-I'll be with you in a minute.
This way, sir.
80 pfennig, please.
-A schnapps.
-Coffee for me.
No, I'll have a schnapps, too.
-So, we begin.
From now on we are alone.
- You will not leave this room
 for a certain period of time.
Possibly a long time,
you are my guest.
But believe me
the moment you step out
of that door
I will no longer know you.
 You know what they called me
 in the courtroom, don't you?
 No? Cold-blooded fromm.
I have a mistress whom I obey.
Her name is justice.
-But I want to be
in the apartment
when my husband arrives.
-He isn't coming back and you
know that, frau rosenthal.
Lock the door. Yes?
- Where is this barkhausen,
 then? Where does he live?
- It's right here.
- Have you heard of that
 old woman that disappeared?
- I know her.
-See what they want. Go on!
-Hey, is the old man at home?
- What's it got
 to do with you?
-A lot.
It's got a lot to do
with the police, too
and with the man at the party.
That's him, inspector.
It was him and the other bum.
 The husband
 of the postmistress.
My father and me,
we caught them in that
Jewish woman's apartment
on the fifth floor.
They wanted
to clear everything out.
 You ought to have
 it confiscated.
-You did it yourself,
you creep.
You and your father.
-Let's go.
Let's talk to the woman.
-She isn't upstairs.
- Herr fromm --
-for you I'm still,
your honor.
Who is your commanding officer?
-Escherich.
Inspector escherich.
 Police headquarters
 prinz Albrecht strasse.
-I know the address.
Get him here.
And then
you leave this apartment.
-Like hell I will.
So, you live alone?
You don't mind
if I look around, do you?
Good day.
-You should have seen it.
Papa got into them,
he had them scared.
 Then me and my brother
 went after him
 and his buddy
 and really had them running.
-Baldur?
-My brother's
an ss sturmbannfuhrer.
- Is that you?
 Baldur persicke?
You often played
in my apartment.
You'd ring the bell
because I gave you apple cake.
Right?
How big you are now.
And how strong.
-Get her out.
-But --
-just go!
 Heil Hitler!
-No!
-She's dead, Otto.
-I saw.
- You said you saw how
 judge fromm hid the old woman
 at his place, didn't you?
 You know what's going on
 in this apartment house.
 A break-in,
 unlawful appropriation
 of national wealth
a denunciation
of a respectable citizen.
Enough!
-Oh, I just..
-And a dead woman who was
very much alive a moment ago.
You're not getting out
of this one.
-You can't do this.
No, you can't.
-Oh, yes, he can,
but he won't.
Because he's a police counsellor
and not a monster.
 I'm sure this gentleman
 didn't take
 anything that doesn't
 belong to him
because he knows
exactly what that would mean.
So, he will do what he does best
when he leaves this place.
He will return to his
comfortable little apartment.
And he will observe
what is going on here.
-Yes, of course, inspector.
I will.
-You can leave now.
-Your honor,
did something happen?
I mean,
has frau rosenthal been --
-i don't know what you
are talking about, frau kluge.
Now, if you'll please excuse me.
-I'll take these
five cards, please.
-With stamps?
- No, I, I already have stamps.
Thank you.
- That makes 25 pfennig.
 I'll wrap it up
 for you right away.
-I need gloves. Thin gloves.
-Sorry, we don't have any.
You might find some..
Let me think.
Maybe you'll find them --
-no, no, it's fine.
Just these. Thank you.
- Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
- Listen, "Hitler's shadow
 falls over Europe
 "like the devil's shadow.
Pass this card on.
Down with the Hitler regime."
What a scrawl! Even my daughter
writes better than that.
-Oh, yes?
-If you ask me, he is
an incredibly stupid person.
-Someone from
the lower classes
who works with their hands.
Perhaps unskilled,
but stupid? No.
-Probably someone
just letting off steam.
Just a flash in the pan.
There is more?
 "Mother.
 The fuhrer murdered my son.
Mother. The fuhrer
will murder your sons, too."
Where?
-Neue konigstrasse.
Two weeks ago.
Another office building.
-Filth.
So what do we do now? Report it?
-If we had more men,
it wouldn't be a problem.
We would catch this, uh,
uh, how shall we call him?
"Hobgoblin," in no time.
I'd investigate
everyone in Berlin
who has lost a son
within the last two weeks.
- Why?
-"The fuhrer murdered my son."
There's only one son.
-And?
-We wait.
We collect information.
Put it together.
That is our job.
We're German professionals.
Not amateurs.
- What if he goes on doing it
 and no more cards
 are turned in?
Who knows how long
this has been going on.
-Think what it would be like
to touch
one of these cards
in a public place.
To stand there, to read it.
Knowing somebody
might be watching you
waiting to record your response.
No, whatever our
hobgoblin writes
it's going to end up
here with us.
Let's say...95 percent.
-I say it's less.
It's a bet?
-So we wait.
We wait for our friend
to make a mistake.
-Good morning.
-Please come in.
-Thank you.
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!
-So, you're from the Nazi
women's league, my dear frau?
I'll just have the girl
bring me my purse.
-I'm not here
for a donation, frau gehrich.
 Definitely not.
-So, what exactly
can I do for you?
-Why aren't you at work?
Didn't you read our arms
industry's calls for help?
-Look at me.
Do I look as if I'm suited
to manual labor?
-Have you ever tried?
-I'm not about
to jeopardize my health.
 Anyway, I can always
 get a medical certificate.
-Of course you can,
you can buy one for 20 marks
from your personal physician
but that won't help you
in this case.
In this case,
you need a doctor from a factory
 to certify that
 you are unable to work.
A doctor that we assign to you.
-Alright, sign me a doctor
and you'll see what happens.
-You're mocking me
and the women's league?
Making fun of our regulations
and our fuhrer?
I warn you
- and I warn you.
You don't seem to know who I am!
My husband
is obersturmbannfuhrer!
-That makes it even worse,
 frau obersturmbannfuhrer.
You'll hear from us.
Unless you have any more
significant information?
An ill mother, perhaps?
-Your ID and your name.
At once!
I promise you,
there will be consequences.
-Here you are.
I don't have
any calling cards..
...because I'm just
a common worker.
 Heil Hitler.
No, I don't understand.
That woman comes under
the labor service duty law.
And you know that
as well as I do.
- Frau gehrich is the wife
of an obersturmbannfuhrer.
So, I'm sure
you understand that --
-well, where does it say
that women like that
are exempt from general duties?
Where?
-Oh, don't be so obstinate.
She has to look after
her overworked husband.
-I do, too!
And from what I saw,
that woman has domestic help.
I didn't do anything wrong.
I acted according
to our regulations.
-So, are you going
to apologize, frau quangel?
-What for?
-Then I will do it,
on your behalf.
And you,
you take some time off.
-Oh, you're throwing me out,
because I told
a woman like that the truth?
-No --
-oh, no, you misunderstood me.
Just take some time off
and rest.
Gather your strength.
-That's important, Anna.
At a time of mourning.
Alright?
-Alright.
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler, herr quangel.
-And all the best for you,
Anna.
- Thank god.
No more women's league.
-Well done.
-How can you be so calm?
I nearly died
when I saw the gloves.
-Gloves, Anna. Just gloves.
-What are we doing, Otto?
We've lost our son.
Other people have lost..
But they, they don't..
-This system, this regime..
 Now I feel that we're free.
I mean..
...freed...From all of it.
This is how I feel.
-Luderitz strasse 23.
-Next.
- Amsterdamer strasse 27.
-Hey, quangel.
Where are you going?
Get into the shelter!
-It's a shelter for mothers
and children, boy.
So it's not suitable for us.
-Hey, what are you doing here?
What are you doing?
Stop! What..
Hey, you! Stop!
Wait! Stop! Stop, wait!
Wait!
 Stop!
Hey.
Hey, you! Wait! Who are you?
-Please, can you help me?
I need to find the shelter
for mothers and children.
I've lost my way. My daughter
is waiting for me there.
You must know
your way around here. Please.
-Your daughter, you say?
-Yeah.
-How old is she?
-She's only six years old.
Six. Waiting for me
at the shelter, she said.
And now she's there
and I am not.
-Yeah, in two blocks
and you're there.
It's calm now, calm down.
The people there
will take care of her.
-I'm, I'm sure
she's frightened and crying..
It's two blocks, you say?
-Yes.
Two blocks and then left.
You can't miss it.
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!
-Well, inspector, let's see
what your filthy hack is up to.
I hear
he's still scribbling away
right under your nose, huh?
- Heil Hitler,
 standartenfuhrer.
He won't give up.
It wasn't to be expected anyway.
Someone who takes one and a half
hours to draw that
is persistent.
Tried it myself.
- Oh, really?
- But rest assured,
 I always find my man.
We run our
operation hobgoblin --
-hobgoblin?
- Yes.
-I like that.
-Glad to hear then.
Judging by the distribution,
the man lives
somewhere around
Alexander square.
There were no cards here
at first
but now he doesn't want
to travel so far
and leaves more and more cards
in his own neighborhood.
- Heil Hitler,
 standartenfuhrer.
-How many?
-He also includes
the eastern districts
and downtown. Here, look.
-I asked you
a question, escherich.
How many?
- One hundred
 and twenty seven,
 standartenfuhrer.
One hundred and twenty nine,
to be exact
with these two
from this morning.
-More than a hundred!
-Yes.
-If more than a hundred cards
were turned in here
doesn't anyone of you wise asses
ever think about how much filth
 is still circulating
 out there?
-With due respect,
let's think about human nature.
No one holds on
to these scribblings
longer than necessary --
-tell me who's been doing this
because I will be asked
and I have to answer.
Now.
- The heroic
 battle of stalingrad.
Someone has to write the truth
with all of these lies..
-What do you think happens
to our cards?
-Why do you want to know?
-I want to know
how people react.
- Some people will
 be afraid, probably.
Afraid that someone may have
watched them pick up the card.
Some will maybe put them back.
 Some people will turn them in
 to policemen, block wardens
but our cards will also be
read by them.
-It's like with a machine.
A little sand in the gears
will not stop the machine..
...but if a person throws
a little more sand
and, and more..
...the motor begins to stutter
 the assembly line stops.
In my mind I see lots of people
throwing sand in the gears.
-You are a romantic,
Otto quangel.
-I'm a mechanic.
- Yeah, that, too.
-You are the romantic.
At least, you used to be.
-What? I, I used to be?
-Still, I saw you first
not the other way around.
-But you didn't say anything.
-You were dancing
with Peter reinke
and then you went with him
to the Chestnut tree
you with your crown of flowers
laughing as if he was
incredibly funny.
Reinke with his
stupid haircut.
He's bald now
and a member of the party.
-I would have
danced with you, too
but you didn't ask.
-You knew the way
i looked at you.
Anyway, I asked you
two years later.
-Not to dance.
So you'd like a dance?
-No, just..
-Is that him, approximately?
-Yes, pretty much. Uh..
His eyes might be a little bit
further apart. It was dark, uh..
-Thank you. You've done
the reich a great service.
- Heil Hitler, inspector.
- Fraulein schaefer.
Have this passed around.
 "Pass the information.
 Join the free press.
 "Fear has taken control
 of you.
 Kill it. Kill Hitler."
 It's a man
 who is no longer young
 who lost his only son
 in the French campaign.
 Inexperienced at writing,
 but intelligent.
 The style has visibly changed
 during the course of the year.
 In recent months, he has used
 the title, "free press."
 He's working in
 an increasingly
 professional way.
 He never leaves fingerprints,
 he operates strategically.
 He never chooses
 the same street twice
 in a row.
 He always changes
 between these streetcar lines
 seven, nine and 11.
"Each thought against
the national socialists
is like sand
in the criminal war machine."
 "Pass on this card.
 Free press."
"How many children have to die?"
"Fear is their only weapon.
Free press."
"Help us to put an end
to the criminal war machine."
Zott, again and again
the picture of a machine.
-Papers.
Papers.
- Today is the 22nd.
Today.
-Birthday.
Sometimes I feel the danger
as if it were so physical.
I actually feel it.
-Please, don't frighten me.
-No.
To hans.
-Hans.
- No, inspector escherich
 isn't in his office.
 Just a moment.
Operator speaking.
Incoming call from
the lothringer street section.
Reported arrest of suspect
in the hobgoblin case.
Yes, I'll put you through.
-Anna.
-Oh, hello, Walter.
-Did he run away? Poor girl.
-No.
I just brought him
his lunch box. He left it again.
-Oh, I thought he was ill.
He isn't here.
-Anna, how are you doing?
You look great.
I'm getting married soon!
- Hanging's too good for you!
-Traitor!
-You're a traitor!
You're an enemy to the people!
-Oh!
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, wait.
We said we'd do this together.
Why didn't you go to work?
-Not now.
-Traitor!
-Do you know
what my day was like?
No. You don't think
of that, do you?
Finding you're not at work
and then thinking you're
still inside that building.
You know what that's
like for me?
What is it, Otto?
You want to get caught?
Is that what it is?
-Nothing happened.
-Nothing happened?
Did you see who they arrested?
-A bum.
He probably stole something.
It has nothing to do with us.
-That's the husband
of our postmistress.
What makes you think
it has nothing to do with us?
-They're divorced.
-That doesn't mean anything,
damn it!
 I was so afraid for you.
What if it's a, a sign,
if it's a warning?
-It isn't.
Stay calm.
Remember, when hans died..
...you said
your life wasn't worth a thing?
You were right.
That's why we can be free
why we don't have
to be afraid.
-But your life
Otto, your life
means something to me now
means, means..
...everything to me now.
-We said
we'd do this together.
-Oh..
-We won't stop.
-Aren't you afraid?
-Today I stayed again
to watch.
I need to see what happens
when people read it.
-Come.
-My sick certificate
had expired.
That's why
i went to see the doctor.
They send me to a camp
otherwise. Please!
I swear
by the lives of my children.
Please.
- Two sons?
And they're both
soldiers, right?
- Both of them. Yes.
One of them
is even in the waffen-ss.
-And they're both alive,
i hope?
-Yes. Here.
Our Karl, in Poland.
-Well...That's good news.
-So the man was caught
red-handed. There are witnesses.
And here, the corpus delicti.
It's obviously the writing
of our hobgoblin.
Come on, escherich.
We've got him.
-You know the criminal's
profile as well as I do, zott.
We're looking for a mechanic
who lost his only son.
And then you drag in
this ridiculous character
a gambler
who doesn't even live
near our target area
with two children
who are very much alive.
-Does that,
does that mean you believe me?
-Yes. You can go.
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Get out.
-God bless you.
Thank you very much.
-Bravo.
-You did what?
You let your hobbygobby go?
-Hobgoblin,
 standartenfuhrer.
With due respect
you may be my superior,
but as a member of the ss
you're not necessarily
a criminalist.
I'm a policeman, and I'm
asking you to let me do my job
just as I have learned
from my experience..
-Experience?
I know all about guys like you.
Intellectuals, wise guys.
Don't mess up my floor!
Swallow your damn blood!
Up! Up, up, up, up, up!
Come. Up.
You think you're clever, huh?
And we're just the guys
from the ss
who don't have a clue, right?
Say it. I want to hear it.
I'm smarter than you guys.
Say it!
Say it! I can't hear you.
-I'm sorry.
Huh?
You have two days..
...two days to eliminate
the guy you let go.
 Now, get rid of that thing!
- Frau quangel?
You're hans's mother, right?
-Yes.
- Uh, Dietrich.
 I was one of
 hans's classmates.
-Dietrich. Of course.
How are you?
-Fine. Thank you.
Well, I'm alive.
-I'm glad you've come back.
- Herr necker?
-Excuse me, I have to go.
You know, frau quangel, I..
...i miss hans a lot.
-I have nothing to do
with enno anymore.
He hasn't been my husband
for a long time
before god.
-Now..
...where were we? Yes.
You were about to tell me
how to find
that ex-husband of yours.
So here you've been hiding?
I know you've nothing to do
with the cards, enno.
- Oh, that's good
 news, inspector --
-but the guys from the ss
think it was you.
 And I'm afraid
 they're in charge now.
In charge of me, too.
They will arrest you,
they will interrogate you
in their own way.
-I'd rather be dead.
-You're right.
You'd rather be dead.
-Uh..
-Shh..
It's alright.
It's better this way.
-No. Please. No!
-Shit!
- Suicide?
 Good news, escherich.
The noose has tightened.
Hm?
 No new cards?
-Not yet.
No.
-Hm.
-Thanks for taking over
for Fritz.
It's getting closer.
-Foreman quangel,
the machine is overheating.
-Turn it off!
Don't you have
anything to do?
Ludwig.
There's something for you.
It's quite something.
Better take it
to the management.
You're a party representative.
You have to do it.
Stick by the rules.
- Yes, sir.
-Everyone on today's shift.
Their names, addresses.
- Of course.
-Our man must live somewhere
between christburger
chodowieckistr
and jablonskistr.
-No, nobody
with that address, inspector.
-Who is the foreman?
Who knows his men best?
-Well, that's Fritz kemper.
-Well, get him here at once.
-That's impossible.
He injured himself this morning.
-  And who replaced him?
- It's quangel.
Otto quangel
from the other shift.
-Well, his name
is not in the list.
I, I thought it was complete.
- Sorry. Uh, he's just
 helping out today.
Of course,
he does not know the people.
-Where does he live?
Otto quangel.
-Walter, where is Otto?
-Good morning,
foreman quangel.
-Good morning.
-Please, have a seat.
 Frau quangel!
 We know you are here!
 Open the door!
 Look at this quangel.
This will surely interest you.
What do you think that is?
Don't even make
the effort, quangel.
 There are exactly 267 cards.
Is that the number
you were looking for?
 Think about it, quangel.
Every single card
was voluntarily turned into us
voluntarily.
We didn't find any ourselves.
They couldn't wait
to hand them over to us
 all those people.
 Some were arrested,
 one committed suicide.
How could you seriously believe
that you would change anything
you, foreman quangel?
-Who killed himself?
- It doesn't matter.
 A small fish. Insignificant.
-Everyone is significant.
It's my fault.
-Oh, there we go.
Now you have
admitted your crime.
 Tell me, quangel, precisely.
How many cards
did you write yourself
 I mean, altogether?
-Two hundred and eighty five.
-Eighteen.
Eighteen cards
weren't turned in.
By the way, we have Anna.
-Then let her go.
She has nothing to do with it.
-I know you are
lying, quangel.
Your wife dictated
what to write.
-Do I look like someone
who would let his wife
dictate things to him?
It was my idea
from the beginning.
I thought it all up.
I carried it out by myself.
-She confessed.
-Now you're lying.
-She confessed. She didn't
want you to get all the credit.
-I'll sign my confession
 but, inspector, Anna
please, don't.
It's, it's not necessary.
-Send a recording clerk
to my office.
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes.
-Ah, escherich.
To the hobgoblin!
-Quangel.
-Anna.
-Otto.
-You know what will happen?
-Yes.
-It can't be changed.
-I know, Otto.
It doesn't matter.
-No.
- All rise!
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
- Time's up.
-Don't be afraid, my child.
Don't be afraid.
Judge fromm,
would you stay with me a moment?
I'll close my eyes
and pretend it is Otto.
-Time, quangel.
 Put these on.
-Can I do something for you?
Is there something you need?
-The card and a pen.
You took her anyway.
-I read all your
cards, hobgoblin.
Yours and your wife's.
I am the only person
who read all of them..
...all of them,
except for 18.
Eighteen cards.
