Black Cobra,
it would be around 3 feet long
That will have a scar of fighting with the Mangoose on it's waist
It bit me four days back
I am saved because of the witch man Subbadu at village
I am now searching for it
I will not leave it, I will kill that
This is its skin shed.The skin is here means it would not have gone far
That would be caught
No idea why but I keep finding something asand when I search for this snake
My name is Chittibabu.I am the Engineer for this village
All look at the sky when their crops needwater in any village,
but they look at me in our village
What Chittibabu, when would you put water to my crops?
I told you that I will put the day after right?
That old fellow is too much in a hurry
What Chittibabu?Why did you water my fields just half and left?
Only half would get wet when you pay only half the money
Hey Chittibabu, see and walk
What rascal? Why does everyone scream..?
Can you not speak normally?Do you not know to talk slowly?
If someone screams again, he will get wet in pants
Not that dudeI will hit with the pipe
Say slowly now
Not that dude, they are cutting thetree there and walk carefully
Yes, you should say like this
I should water to your half acre right? Ok, I will
Not just you but will water his, his and even his.
I will not leave anyone
Hey ChittibabuHey Chittibabu, stop
Why are you screaming again?
Who else will come for you?
If not me, you think Goddess Gangescomes from the sky and water?
Chittibabu, come this side
Oh noHey
You now understood why they are screaming so loud right?
Because I cannot hear until someone screams aloud
This is our engine problem
Thus all in village say us Engineer, no...
call me sound engineer
Whatever but this deficiency is a boon to me
Hey chittibabu..See him asking loud to pay back the money.
I heard it but I did not listen to that
That means I listen to some sounds and some are seen
Deaf rascal
Look, he is leaving saying somethingand that was seen to me
Hey Errababu
Come back for once
What..?
You said something just passing over?
What did I say Chittibabu?I did not say anything ChittibabuWhat did you say?
You said something. Your lips gave a movement.
Say what?
Oh that?I just asked is the chutney fine?
No dude, you said something elseWhat did I say?

What would that be?
Deaf rascal,... say so

SayNo
Say... deaf rascal

Deaf rascal... You said the same, yes
I've arranged for a desciple too to sayif anything is missed out
Mahesh, what is the news?

We started with engine early in the morning right?
Papayamma came opposite in theway showering the dung water
She asked in love, hey Chittibabu will you eat the cheese?
Why will she not ask?I've given 10 rupees discount too for the engine
She should ask
Then Rangamma Aunty on the river shore shouted loudand you may have heard that
Yes, only Rangamma aunt speaks soloud in the entire village like I can hear.
Even this engine belongs to aunt.
Her voice is loud but heart is soft.
She helps anyone in need from this village.
Be cool Rangamma, you too will have kids
Yes, it is true for my hubby to return from Dubaiand true that I will have kids
Here is 20 rupees.
Hey Rangamma aunt!
If you don't return by the coming festival, I'm not any good ladyHey, Rangamma Aunty..
Hey..wait.
and will ask before all in the street

Thanks.
Yes, how is it? It looks great on uncle.
It looks good for you.
What..?
I am saying it looks good for you
What..? Okay.
Here, your hundred
Keep it dearMy darling
I did not say our village name, right?
Rangasthalam!
The real story just starts
(Village Traditional Song)
What Narsamma,looks like you have a bumper crop this year...
You cannot be controlled now
What do we have brother,it is all the result of hard work from my son
He worked very hard dayand night to somehow get his sister married
He is my maternal son in law right?
It is all about your marriageCome on brother
Here is the advance 3000,I will give total payment when we sell all the bags
When would you give?
Come on,I'm saying will return right?
We hereby inform to everyone that as Bollam Narasammadid not repay the loan taken from society,
the crops from this land belongs to the society
None should either cut the crop or work in this
If does so,
Why are you announcing so,your loan is repaid long back right?
Oh no..no.. public are not having any proper thinking
What, have you dreamt that your loan is over so fast?
The money you gave was enough for the compoundedinterest and the Principal is still remaining
What do we know about those entire accounts sir?
As you did not ask, we thought loan is completely cleared
We have been repaying the loan with allwe got from crops from the past six years
and we do not understandwhy the loan is not yet cleared sir
What can I do man,
I am the society President.
You shout if I collect and he would shout if I do not
See how the officer is sitting in the Jeeplike a swollen potato
What man, how much pay did you give?
You would give 10 rupees less perone bag as you are giving cash
I'm paying 100 rupees per sack sir
Pay the balance in the society and take the seed bags
Sir, I have planned to get my daughter married this year sir.
I cannot do it after this year, you show mercy sir
Are men any less in the village?
Give another chance to people like me whose wife is dead
Hey..
Oh no...
Brother...
Don't cry
Namaste sir.
Sir, it is all over. My son is dead sir.
He is gone leaving me
Why do you cry?
What do we do when there is a tree full of fruits?We see the ripe fruit, cut it and eat
Even the God is like us,he sees for the correct guy and takes him
Ok, think his life time is over.
Here, look into the works to happen
Sir...
Sir...
He is the President of our village.
He is being elected unanimously from 30 years
There is none even filing nominations against him
In Rangasthalam there is only one party and one flag.
What he says is the judgment and what he makes is the law
Not just before him but none dares towalk with slippers in front of his house
He is very crazy about radio
He is a great devotee. He is into worships year long
Few believe because of that he has some powersand something bad happens opposing him
Elections have come again in our village
His is the only nomination as the President even this time
Hail to the President sir
It is like a celebration in the village if he is filing nomination
Ranga..Ranga.. In Rangasthalam...
Ranga..Ranga.. In Rangasthalam...
Not like one listens but hit like all see
Ranga...Ranga...In Rangasthalam we are all toys andpuppets though we have do not put any color or makeup
We are all toys and puppets
In Rangasthalam we are all toys and puppetswho cannot stop once the game starts
We are all toys and puppets
We are the toys being played by an invisible hand
We are the puppets dancing to an unheard song
Ganga is the wife Lord Sivaand the air is the father of Hanuman
Either to breathe air or to wet the throat,they should show mercy
Flute is the instrument of Lord Krishna,Triceps is the weapon of Goddess Kali
Either to sing a song or to attack with weapon,it happens only when they permit
Ranga...Ranga...In Rangasthalam we are all toys andpuppets though we have do not put any color or makeup
We are all toys and puppets
It is Ravana having ten heads andLord Rama has not even a single bad thought
They kept Rama and Ravana and played the game ofRamayana and put us in between good and bad
The one who cannot put aside morals is Dharmarajuand the one with no mercy is Yamadharma
That attack is a must not walking in his path,saying so they are running our life like a play
In Rangasthalam we are all toys and puppetswho cannot practice before playing
We are all toys and puppets
What Chittibabu sir, is your brother coming?
Yes, he is coming after one yearOh, is it?

Ramalakshmi has taken 10000 and they wrote 20000
Many in the village are into troubles because of society

Just recently here,
Come..Somaraju uncle.

It was ok as my brother Chittibabu came and saved.

Hey Pallau,
Hey Seshu Naidu Sir is talking listen

President Sir is asking right? Is what you took 10 or 20?
Say clearly, you drunkard rascal
I took 20000 sir
Ok Pallau, you go
Why did you change word so father
Hey, I am being quiet as you are a motherless child,you ruined my prestige and put me at Panchayat.
Move now to the house.
What is that dude, why is Ramalakshmi leaving?You wait Sir
That is the matter, it is clear now right?
As Kumar hit the society clerk,
for none to again point at society again in the village,please declare that penalty Sir
What dude?
Penalty is Rs.20,000
Koteswara Rao, bring and pay the moneyat Panchayat in two days
What is it Sir,

Here, our Raju Sir is also ready to buy.
What Sir?Yes.
I will go and bring 10000 as advance right away
How can we sell that land sir?
That is the hard earned land by motherselling milk and cow dung
Was it hard earned?
Why do all in village say that father of Presidenthas written that on the name of your mother?
Hey you, what are you talking?
It is what is the truth
Wait..
What dad, what is wrong?
Nothing, they are asking us to pay the penalty.
Why would we pay, we will not pay
What?
I will bring the papers and give tomorrow morning sir
Ok, go now
Do whatever you can and we are not going to pay
Enough of the amusement you had, go now idiots
No stability in lives but started to better the village
Mom, it was great to see dad talking today
When Seshu Naidu asked to pay the finehe strongly said not to pay
What brother?Yes.
You too spoke great
Why all these for us, son?
No problem in losing the land but we lost the prestige
What did you cook mom?Fish curry..serve it.
I will eat more..
What dude, is father not hungry?
Hey, give that curry.
Nothing, I thought it may get spoilt by morning
What is the news today Mahesh, start the cassette?
Nothing much today sir
Milk Satyam came opposite in the way this morning right?
His granddaughter is into puberty andasked us to come for lunch tomorrow
Not that dude, say what happened today at the Panchayat
At the Panchayat? You know what happened right?
Not that dude, all laughed when Ramalakshmisaid something right? Say what that is
Oh that,
when President sir said she is a girland how will she know all these accounts
Ramalakshmi said she studied up to sixth classand all laughed loud for that
Have they laughed dude?
If not, she is egoistic that she studied more than us.
She would be down now
And after that you know it.
That Pallala changed his wordand they asked your brother to pay fine
And we said not to pay that and that is all.
See you now.Hey Mahesh, sit down dude
Yes Mahesh,
Seshu Naidu said something while getting down the steps.
What did he say?
What did he say, he said to sell your land and pay the fine
What, just for that my brother said strongly to talk properly?
That is, the land was hard earned byyour grandmother and it is a sentiment for us.
Will one not get angry when asked to sell that?
Yes, we should get anger
Still, brain is working great for my idiot brother these days
What Chittibabu...
Your dad used to daily come for the leaves after foodand why did he not come today?
What do I know?
Maybe he is not hungryand did not have food even at home.
What hunger will he have for what Seshu Naidu said?
We ourselves felt bad listening to the wordsand definetly your father would have felt very very bad?
Oh no, he said so dirty and that is very wrong
It is time for my Chitralahari and I will leave now
What did Seshu Naidu say?
That is, I said right Sir...
What did Seshu Naidu say?
I said that he asked to sell land ofyour grandma and pay the fine, right Sir?
Remember well and say

Better remember well.better tell me what Seshu Naidu has said?
My mother is alone and I will leave
I will kill you rascal,
say what Seshu Naidu said to my father
When he said how can we sell the hard earned land fromselling milk and cow dung,
that filthy rascal said...
Is it hard earned by selling milk and cow dung?
He said father of President gavethat in writing to his mother to your dad
Your dad felt like he is dead Sir
I too felt bad as he said so to your father.
He said so bad to your father...
See you Seshu Naidu Sir

I have been waiting from so long for this moment.
Come on sign
Their games will not run from now on..
How much more long would you look downat the ground, President Sir?
Look up for once, a new flag has come to Rangasthalam
Villagers got bored seeing same Presidentand one flag for so long, President Sir
Village is wishing for a change now
Thus, I filed nomination as Presidentin the elections this time
We came to put a word to you as a respect.
Huh, hairs!
Yes...
My brother may not listen unless spoken aloud
But for you....you could not listen so faras there was none to talk loudly till now
There are many problems in the village President sir.
Village is the same as it was in my childhood
They are looting people on the name of society debts.
I know who is behind all that
That is why, the village will not changeunless the power changes hands
Brother, I heard this. Shall I say?
Sir, politics have started in Rangasthalam.
Get ready for the elections Mr. Phanindra Bhupathi Sir
What, you feel to have heard it somewhere?Maybe you forgot, it is your name
See you, Phanindra Bhupathi sir
Move dudeMove
It will now be the interval for him, brother
Even the breed eating grass is raising their voice,how did they get so much courage President Sir?
This courage is not theirs but of the flag they are carrying
The boys we got bail have come
Come sit..
You did a great work guys.
It was my dream from 20 yearsto have my party flag in your village
It is being fulfilled after so long.
I have never at least stepped intoyour village because of that President
He is like demon Bakasura,he is eating away the money of public
I am an MLA for this constituency but not for Rangasthalam
Not just a single vote,I did not get even a single vote in your village
Now I got the confidence.
You have to work hard
Work hard
Ok sir
Your village should develop and ask for any help you need
I will risk even my life for your victory
He is Dr. Murthy and he did the surgery
here was a deep wound on the headWe almost removed blood clots
and we did the best to our efforts.
He is not responding for anything.He is gone into a coma
As far as I know, it is tough for him to be alive
Why tough Doctor, what tough?
He is breathing right?
His heart is also beatingand how can you say he will die?
If he was to die, he should’ve been deadwhen the Lorry dashed him
He will not die, are you any God to say?
What sir, you will live right?
He will live it seems, he said and I heard it
You should live sir, you should live.You have to make him live
Nothing will happen to you sir..
I will take care.
Ok madam, you understood please sign on this
What madam.. what are you doing doctor?
It’s tough now
It’s tough now
You too have been seeing from so long.It’s the same whatever we may wait
Thus we had to come take this decision
What does it mean?
You wish to kill him?
No son, we too are feeling sad.
But the Doctors are saying it’s tough right?
How long would you work hard more?
Still. How long more can we keep him so?
Don’t say like that please
Our fate is like that....We have nothing more
I am indebted to him
He will live. I need him Doctor sir
Do one thing, all of you leave in a feeling that he is dead
If he lives by chance, I’ll bring him to you
Give it that.
Come on, have the curry.
I feel pity seeing you Chittibabu.
You don’t eat in time, sleep in full
Why do you work so hard day and nightfor a person you have no relation with?
Go back to your village get into some work
Look Chittibabu, what’ve I said now?
Hey Ramalaxmi... Hey Ramalaxmi stop...
Hey Laxmi... I can't run with you..Laxmi stop
Hey, stop.
Hey stop... where will you go...
Will you talk the same way even afteryour brother becomes the President?
What?
You... Won’t you leave this stick till you get your snake?
Why do you talk loud? Why not speak low?
Is ours a love to have eyes in eyes to talk silently?
Ours is a love to shout loud in the ears
Not that dear,
we too have a system to speak slowlyand with love. Sit, I’ll say.
Come on sit
Listen, I’ll say what our system is
Ok, say
Now, I’ll say what Ramalaxmi dear
For that you reply saying, you say Chittibabu
Then I’ll say why are your eyes so red
You’ll reply, when did you let me sleepcoming into dreams for the whole night
I’ll say, if so give me a kiss Ramalaxmi
You should then feel shy and say can’t kiss so
Then I’ll hold you tight and kiss
If it is so, we can talk even if you talk in low voice.
What a brain?
Ready?Yes
What Ramalaxmi?Say Chittibabu
Why are your eyes so red, dear?
I had no sleep for the whole night.You came into my dreams
If so, give me a kiss dear
Hey..
I should kiss and you must feel shy right?
Ok kiss
What?Someone is laughing
Hey, I cannot listen right? Come on...
Right here...
Hey, you go home.
There is someone and I’ll have a look
Careful...
Chittibabu, careful...
Powers of the Kings ruling are vanished at this place...
The black beeds of a tender wifehave broken down at this place...
This is the stage where theEvil lord dances along with the ghosts
Rangasthalam...
Oh no Ganapathi uncle... What is that?
It seems you were dead falling under the train, right uncle?
Oh no, have they ended my role so in Rangasthalam?
The same play from the past 30 years.
There will be no hero in this play,there would just be the villain called the President
If anybody tries to become thePresident his role ends right here in this mud
It’s like someone is dying if our village has elections
Hey, what are you talking?
Has your brother filed nominations?
Is he wishing to become the leader?Yes
His role too would end
You don’t know who they areand from where they would come.
They come when this Rangasthalamis asleep and end the roles
Don’t leave, don’t leave your brother alone.
It’ll end, the role will end.
Careful, be careful
I had to file the nomination in a compulsory situation,
please understand Padma
Don’t say anything else
What did you say me?
You said we’ll get married and go away once you get a job
You said we can both live happily.
All those are false statements right?
What happened now?
I do not understand why you did so?
Who’s that?
Who’s that?
Hey...Brother, it’s me Chittibabu.
What are you doing here Chitti?
Nothing I followed in a fear thatsomething may happen to you
What’ll happen to me?
It seems they would kill if anyone who contestsopposite to the President
Who said so?
What?
Who said so?Hey, silent
Ganapathi uncle said me
Go away.. you...
Hey... Chitti... Chitti, he is a mad fellow
He keeps roaming singing poems and sayingsomeone is killed and his madness has gone to peaks.
Mad... He is mad, right?Yes Chitti
I too got a doubt brother
That’s why I didn’t care much
Is it sound Engineer sir?
President is gone high in sarcasmThank you
I’ll beat you up if you overact
(Chants)
All villagers are into thinking why is the President silentwhen they came in lungi and slippers and challenged
That Dakshinamurthy has no courage to step into thisvillage and no idea what their courage is seeing him
What is a festival when it is cleaned up dude?There should be ward members to file nomination right?
Who would step forward opposing the President Sir?Who is such a man in Rangasthalam?
Hey Edukondalu, my brother is contestingthis time in the President elections
and you all need to be with him
If not, I’ll not put engine in your fieldsand they would go dry. Take care
Chittibabu, I’m talking right? You be quiet
No bro, they should have some fear
Ok, you talkOk, sit
Are you fine uncle?
We’re just living son. What is the matter?
You know right, I am contesting as the President.
I felt it would be good if you are the memberfor this eighth ward.
What’s it, there is already a President for this village right?Why another President again?
It is not as easy to wave the flag to win the elections, idiot
Come on, it is being said for your good right?
When nobody is coming,it should either be a fear or a confidence
If fear, nothing can be done,
if confidence, that should be driven out
We should make all know that President is theone behind the scams of society
Oh no..you go..go.
Hello sir..
Sir, checking officers have come there
Oh no
Rongali Chandramma and took 10000
Give the pass book
The Principal take is just 6000 sir
Matta Somaraju, taken 8000Oh God
Principal taken is 5000 sir
Kota Ranga has taken 6000Just 3000 sir
Pullam Narasamma has taken 12000
NarasammaI took only 6000 sir
Even my son committed suicidefor not being able to pay this debt
See officer...This is the situation
What man, is it become a habit to eat well?
What are these wrong accounts?
Have you understood at least now,how they are looting you on the name of society?
The same took place recently even inthe case of Ramalakshmi’s father.
They cheated him and made him lie
This is all a drama played by that Presidentand that Seshu Naidu is just a puppet
They are looting the whole village keeping him in middle
You are looking to him as a God
Say one thing, has the village changedin his rule or have our lives got better?
For you, I filed nominations as President for you people
Support me and file nominations as ward member
Even my nomination goes wasteif none of you come forward
Give it a thought
What are you still thinking,come on file the nomination as a ward member
What are you doing here when PresidentSir has started the worship?
Come on..move.

What, I should file nomination as ward member for you?
You should have some shame to ask

Yes, say no way and send him back
Go..go. Hey wait
Kumar Babu, I will support you
Hey brother, what are you talking?
Hey, till date they hit us and we hit them
But is there any man who hit President’s guy?
Chittibabu has hit
Why is that Kasi pointing finger?
And thus his brother is got the couragetoday to file nomination
Still, is he doing all this for his good?
He is doing this all for the development of the village
Hey...Hey, be quiet guys.
It is a waste if we do not support at least now
Kumar Babu, I am behind you.
I’ll do whatever you say. Say me what to do.
He is talking with his hands moving,listen what he is saying
Sir, you cannot listen and not me.I can listen even being here
This is enough Kasi
Come on Kumar Babu
I’ll break his finger if something goes wrong.
Oh no, your brother is seeing angrily at me.
Go and say him what I said, else he may again hit me
Chitti, Kasi said to support us
What?
First say what I said about him
He said we fought each other in the village till date
but your brother hit President’s guy and he is great
Is it?Yes
You’re great dude.

What are you doing Chittibabu?
Ramalakshmi is mine
Take your hands off
Take your hands off
It’s because of you.They’re getting her married fearing because of you
How will they give hands to a guy opposing the President?
Will the whole village not exile themif they give her to you in marriage?
Still, you have no base and how would youtake care of her, if you get married to her?
Ok, do one thing. I will somehow plead,request President Sir and get money
You say your brother to take back the nominations
Then I‘ll give Ramalakshmi’s hand to you in marriage
Why till then, I’ll give the money right now.You take her hand, go
Yes..take.
Take the money, at least you get better
So, you too have joined hands in President’s politics.
I neither need this money nor Ramalakshmi.Get her married to anyone you like
But the vote should be to my brother
Will you be on that side Naganna, will you come this side?
Will you be on that side Naganna, will you come this side?
There is justice, law, our own this side

Whom to ask for doing a good deed?We just filed, that’s all
Are you the only men in the village?
You think none opposed President till date?
You remember Erra Sreenu?
I know
How did he die?
Jumping recently into Godavari
Why, does he not know swimming?
Abbulu then, how did Abbulu die?
That fellow, he died drinking pesticide
Then why were knife wounds on the body?
Were they there?
You know when would guy who can swim Godavarifrom this end to that, die drowning in a canal?
When opposing President
Come on.. Eat..
even your uncle has been just like your brother
They are misusing all the Panchayat funds
The accounts you are writing in the societybooks are different from the originals
He said power should change.
Your uncle wished to file nominationsafter coming back from Dubai
I will file nomination in the coming electionsand see what you will do then
He returned from Dubai
Your uncle is not in Dubai, they killed him
This is your uncle’s watchand thus asked you to wear it that day
Watch is for you, wear it.
Aunty, why didn’t you say?
This Rangamma aunt is a beauty right?
By getting to know that my husband diedevery guy from the village feels like a man
All the murders happening in the villagemaybe of different types but the reason is the same
To oppose the President...
Your uncle. Abbulu, Erra Srinu, Venkatrao...
All these didn’t die as their death came but were killed
Say now, will even your brother become like all these?
He killed those all just as they wished to file nominations
Your brother has already filed nominations.
You think President will stay quiet?
President sir...we know that it is you lootingall our house plots and ruining our crops
Thus we are competing oppositeyou in the elections and standing before you
I know all this is because of the power.
Those in power are looting in the name of the society,
I will file nominations this time for President post.
Do what you can
Has your brother filed nomination?
He wishes to become a leader? His role too would finish
Say now, should even your brother become so?

and that my brother will take back his nomination
Still what is that fellow Sir?He put the knife to throat and said he will kill himself...
I died watching that Sir.
I don't need this money.
Still, I feel very proud seeing my brother.
He is doing so much for the village
How much more should I do for such a guy?
I will do sir, I will do
I will do for sure Sir
Yes, I forgot.
Whole village is saying that President Sirdoes so many worships and he has great powers
and those powers will kill if anybody opposes him
I mean those people, that Abbulu, Venkatrao, Erra Srinu...
They say all these died the same way
President sir...
You should know if they are true or not.You are a great man
If that is really true by chance, say a word to your powers
There is a brother named Chittibabu to Kumar Babu.
To touch him, say that you got to crossthe guts of this Chittibabu
Also say you cannot go crossing, ok?
Hey, Sir heard what all I said.Come on beat it now

So..beautiful..
Get out.

Will any idiot let go such a cute girl?
This Chittibabu is letting her go.
Get out
Even after saying so many timesto this Chittibabu that I want this Ramalakshmi,
these ears are not listening
Hey Ramalakshmi, you know what?
I like you, but I like my brother more than you
What am I to do?
You know why am I crying even now?
Not because you are ready for the marriage.
My brother at home, he put the knife to throatand said he will kill himself...
I am getting to cry remembering that
But I have just one pain.
I left everything for my brother. I left you too
And can you not let go your father for me?
I am saying now.
when you have as muchlove on me as I have on my brother, that day you tell me.
I will not leave anyone.
I will come myself, take you and marry you
Move...
Stop crying.
If this marriage stops, your fatherwould this time really die consuming this poison
You’ll not die with the small tin, have the big can and die
What are those papers?
Voter list it seems Sir
We were unanimous all these days and thus we never saw it
Scrutiny is done and it seemswe shall get ready for the elections
Huh, politics have changed in Rangasthalam.
It looks like a new President may be coming for the village
We killed all those Venkatrao, Abbulu,Rangamma’s husband
and even Erra Srinu son of our servantEdukonadalu who opposed us till date
But we erred in the case of that Kumar fellow being quiet
Why do you cry?
Even that God is like us, he keeps taking the right guy
I could not know that you are that God sir,I could not know
I could not know
I am sorry Sir, I did not notice
Still what can we do now Sir,whole village is on the side of Kumar babu

What rascal?I am sorry sir
They don’t come even the bell is rung.Are they too deaf like me
Hey Govindulu, we returned President’s money

Why will I come in? You think I have no ego?
Mom..chitti has come

We had foreseen that now...
We started now to kill that fellow withthe symbols as she said
On the north side to the village at the big tree,black smokes would come...

foxes are safeguarding him
I killed him...Have you killed?
Yes..sir!
Erra Srinu, Abbulu, Venkatrao and finally husbandof Rangamma aunt who takes great care of me...
The guy killing so many...It’s justified to kill such a guy, right Sir?
It is justified...
He has to be killed
But you killing my brother is not justified sir
Hey, what are you saying?Why should I be killing your brother?
Yes sir, I too did not understandwhy you had to kill my brother
He said something while dying Sir
Srimannarayana...
I am a deaf rascal and cannot listen to properly
I never was worried as I cannot listen, Sir.
For the first time, I felt very bad thinkingwhy God has given me this deficiency
But that same God has shown another way out
The song played in celebration andwhat my brother said before dying was the same
Srimannarayana...
Srimannarayana...
Srimannarayana...
Srimannarayana...
Srimannarayana...
Srimannarayana...
Luckily, there is no Srimannarayana in our village Sir
We are all the children of mother Ganges Sir!But, I heard that name somewhere
It is tough to put words into Chittibabu's ears.but once it goes in, it stays stamped there
Yes for once, I heard that from you Sir
Hey SrimannarayanaChitti
My man and brought coffee for me
Srimannarayana is your man
He said it all before dying
Why did you kill my brother? Who asked you to kill, say
Who asked you to kill, say
Dakshinamurthy...your brother loved the younger daughter of him
It seems my brother was in love withyour younger daughter, right?
I will be to the hostel dad...
Here..
Come home at least this SaturdayOkay.
Will you kill when someone loves Sir?
Srimannarayana...
It is so horrible sir.
You gave a bail to me with no relation
You made my brother file nomination,got him killed and pushed into the account of President
You took a full life Sir
Will anyone stay quiet instead of killing?you bloody rascals.
Your brother is not qualified even to step into my houseand how can he think of stepping into my daughter’s bedroom?
What are you and what’s your life?
Now you are talking correct Sir, this is your real face
Yes rascal! Can you hear, you deaf idiot
Why did you save after knowing that I killed?
I thought to kill you as and when I came to know sir,but Lorry hit you by then
I took you fighting death to the hospital.
I served you a lot sir.
I changed you dress, washed your clothesand even cleaned your toilet
My hand while shaving your beard shook
Shivering... Like this..
I thought to kill you right then sir,but you know why I kept you alive Sir?
You should know how painful it is when your dying
and before that you should understandall my pain that i have undergone.
My brother told me Sir.
Even the criminal given a hanging sentencewill not be hung if he has even a small fever
He should be healthy andhe being healthy should have hopes to live
Hey..
see sir..now you see
Look Sir, you are so greedy.Added you wish to become even a Minister now
It is justified to kill now, right Sir?
Just wait...
Do you remember him.
My Brother.
For killing my brother Chelluboina Kumar Babuof Rangasthalam village,
and his brother Chelluboina Chittibabu will kill you.
Now you understood sir.
