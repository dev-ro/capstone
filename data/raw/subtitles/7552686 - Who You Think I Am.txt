WHO YOU THINK I AM
Mrs Millaud? Mrs Millaud?
Could you let me come later
next time?
I don't do well in the morning
with the evening Valium.
We'll see after the session.
Dr Zimman understood perfectly.
We met after lunch.
I heard you.
It's such bad luck,
Zimman having a stroke just now.
How does it work?
Do I start over from the beginning?
- I'd feel like I'm repeating...
- It's not repeating.
You express things differently,
from another point of view.
The change could be very beneficial.
You look like you want
to ask about my position.
No?
About how I work?
Your name is Catherine Bormans.
Medical doctor.
You have advanced training in psychiatry.
You're a practising psychologist.
You've done short-term contracts
in public hospitals for twenty years.
You came here
on a moment's notice...
to replace Dr Zimman.
That's about all I could find on Google.
But you're not how I imagined.
Younger.
You've got the basics.
What do I start with?
What do you want to start with?
Ludo.
It would be best
to tell you about Ludo.
A new project?
Beachfront bar.
Nice pictures.
Alex took them.
Alex?
A buddy who's staying with me.
He's a photographer.
I thought you didn't like
having people over.
He's different. We've been friends
since we played rugby together.
He just got dumped.
I like that one,
you've got a lovely expression.
Really?
Anyway, I'm in a hurry.
- I requested an Uber.
- Leaving already?
The bar owner
wants to meet me tomorrow.
You said
we'd spend the weekend together.
Are you sulking?
Aren't you too old for that?
You weren't sulking earlier.
I don't understand why you do that.
Do what?
Why you call me if you have no pleasure
spending time with me.
I adore taking pleasure with you.
You thought you'd introduce me
to your sons?
I could be their brother.
If you'd rather we didn't see each other...
That's not what I meant.
It's what you said.
Can you drop me over there, please?
Keep in touch?
What became of Laclos after the scandal of
Dangerous Liaisons?
The man of letters was first and foremost
a man of action.
A soldier, an engineer,
and a man of conviction.
The French Revolution was an incredible
opportunity to make history for him.
A supporter of the Duke of Orleans,
he was suddenly arrested at...
He was arrested on...
He was arrested in...
In 1793?
In 1793, thank you,
and jailed at La Force Prison
and then at Picpus.
Can you imagine
who would be locked up
within those same walls one year later?
Hello?
Hello. Who is this?
It's Ludo's boy on the phone.
And you?
Can you put him on, please?
No, he can't come to the phone.
He's opening oysters.
It's Claire.
Claire. Claire who?
Ludo?
Have you heard of a Claire?
Nope, don't know any Claire!
- Pardon me?
- There must be some mistake.
No, can you put him on, please?
Let me explain.
I'm Alex, Ludo's assistant.
He'll call at his earliest convenience.
OK, fine.
Can I speak with Ludo, please?
He's not here!
I just heard him!
He's just left!
This isn't funny.
LUDO HAS NOT ACCEPTED
YOUR REQUEST.
Do you use social media, Dr Bormans?
For people like me, it's both the...
the shipwreck and the life raft.
We float in the virtual.
Now we're the spider,
now we're... the gnat.

Clara...
NIGHT SOULS
Clara Antunès.
Twenty-four, twenty-five...
I wasn't targeting Alex at first.
I didn't know him.
He didn't interest me.
I only sent him a friend request on Facebook
to get to Ludo.
FRIEND REQUEST SENT
I didn't have to wait long.
LIKE
Glad you like my pix.
They're fantastic.
Wow, thanks!
You've got a lot of talent.
Have a nice night.
Stay!
Which one do you like best?
All of them. I can't choose.
And you, what do you do?
I'm in fashion.
Model?
Dream on...
I organise publicity events
around fashion. Intern.
Paid peanuts.
Never heard that expression.
My boss is really stingy...
...cheap.
My boss is a loser,
but it's good for my CV.
I've got time, I'm young.
How was it?
OK.
Did you do anything special?
We went bowling.
That's nice, isn't it?
Was she there?
- It doesn't bother me anymore, you know.
- Yes.
- Sure.
- It's true.
Why do you ask?
They were like Siamese twins.
It's true, they suck.
So who won?
She won the first time,
and Dad the second, I think.
Not you?
- He came in last, the loser.
- Shut your face.
We can up our language, it's allowed.
Max, not at the table.
"Child!
Envy not our grief-encumbered years,
"When hearts are now enslaved,
and now rebel,
"When laughter oft
is sadder than your years.
"O hasten not to force
your artless mind;
"Enjoy the morn,
enjoy life's vernal prime;
"Your days are flowers,
one to the other twined -
"Pluck not the leaves
before the hand of Time."
It doesn't really inspire me.
Sorry, but it's for old people.
Well... you got the theme,
that's a start.
So how do I analyse it?
I'm not taking the baccalaureate.
Still in the meeting.
What are the stylistic devices?
What's the rhyme scheme?
It's nice.
I'm happy to help,
but you have to do your share.
OK, whatever.
Don't get angry!
It's crossed rhyme, ABAB.
Stylistic devices, there are three.
Metaphor, does that ring a bell?
That little green light...
indicating the other is online,
that he's also there,
in front of his screen.
What did you feel
when you saw that green light?
Comfort.
A puff of Ventolin
and I could breathe easier.
I'm...
very ugly...
and very old.
Excitement.
And funny, too!
Maybe he's looking at what you're doing,
the pictures you commented on,
the music you listen to.
It's crazy when you think about it,
everything he can know about you.
You're not on Insta??
Insta?
Insta...
Social network, photo and video-sharing,
mobile platforms...
It's not my style...
to do like everyone else.
You could use the internet
to buy in advance...
It's getting hard for you.
Why?
You can't do without me...
You still stand in line,
unless you've got your pass.
Are you OK, Claire?
Is anything wrong?
No. Actually, yes...
A guy, not very subtle.
Tell us! Who is he?
Nothing, just a...
a young guy getting carried away.
- A student?
- He likes playing with fire...
Maybe...I...
Are you playing the cougar?
I'm not playing.
It's very serious.
We say cougar for women,
but what's the word for men?
We say "man", don't we?
Men have always been with younger women,
it's no big deal.
It's not comparable though.
It's not on the same level.
Devil's advocate!
I need to know.
What do you want, exactly?
Let's say you're intriguing.
Really? Why?
The way you act!
How do I act???
Intriguingly.
If, from the 20th century,
we had to choose one female writer
who was independent,
we should turn our attention
to Marguerite Duras.
"Very quickly," she wrote,
"In my life it was too late.
"At 18, it was already too late.
"Between 18 and 25,
"my face moved
in an unexpected direction.
"I don't know if it's the same
for everyone, I never asked.
"I do remember hearing
about that thrust of time
"that sometimes strikes
"as we're passing through the youngest
"and most celebrated ages of life."
Each word was chosen with care.
A tiny error on my part...
a single mistake of language and...
the magic could be lost.
You know what I'd like?
Go ahead!
A REAL PICTURE OF YOU!!!
I couldn't refuse him that picture.
Why?
He would have started
to suspect something.
I couldn't hold back anymore.
It excited me, I think.
That's when...
the spiral started.
A spiral?
I was going to give Clara Antunès
a real face.
Hello?
It's Clara.
You're calling from a hidden number?
I'm making sure you're not...
a psychopath.
OK, I get that.
So...
do I sound like Dexter?
No.
Your voice is...
It's bizarre,
it's not how I imagined.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
No, don't be sorry, you're...
You have a very pretty voice.
Personally, I think my voice is...
really irritating.
I don't think so.
That's nice of you.
Your voice is...
very young.
How old are you, exactly?
You're legal, I hope?
You're 24, right?
Almost 25 now.
You sound younger.
People often say that.
I... I've posted a picture.
You don't like it?
I do. I love it.
So you like me?
Yeah, not bad.
Did you see my comment?
How not to like this sublime creature!!!
Thank you.
So...
Can I have your number now?
Right, OK...
Not only hidden, now you're mute.
Clara?
Who was the picture of?
No idea.
I picked it at random.
You didn't mind that Alex...
when he was thinking of you,
in his head it was...
another woman?
No, not really.
He said he liked my voice.
He liked my words, how my mind works,
and that's really me.
If I'd told the truth,
put my real picture on Facebook,
Alex wouldn't have accepted
my friend request.
He wouldn't have wanted
to make close acquaintance
with a woman like me.
A woman like you?
Yes, a woman...
with heavy eyelids
and a fading complexion.
It's important to you
that people find you beautiful and young.
Isn't it?
It's a pleasure
I've never wanted to give up.
I like being looked at, being pretty.
Don't you?
And yet to that man
you sent the picture of another woman.
It's true,
I did the complete opposite.
As if...
I didn't give myself a chance
to exist in his eyes.
Now you can call me.
Clara the mute.
Baudelaire, in his analysis,
saw the Marquise de Merteuil
as a female Tartuffe,
always one step ahead,
always superior to Valmont.
What interested him most
wasn't so much
her obvious superiority over Valmont,
but her rebellion as a woman,
her rebellion against
a hypocritical society.
Open your books to letter 81.
9 MISSED CALLS
When I was with him, I...
I felt alive.
Very young, Merteuil resolved
to create a unique self.
I'd never felt so alive.
I wasn't pretending to be 24...
I was 24.
Have you known a lot of guys?
On Facebook?
No, I mean...
guys who've mattered to you.
Only one man
ever really mattered to me.
You're not even 25.
You've still got time.
Do you still think about him?
I wish...
I could just remember
the good times, but...
that's hard to do.
What did you two talk about?
Theatre, art...
books.
Wow, you were dating
an intellectual!
Yeah.
- Was he older than you?
- A little.
You're gonna be bored
with a guy like me.
Do I seem bored?
Not really.
It's been a long time since...
It's been a long time since
I felt this good with someone.
That got me.
- Clara?
- Yes?
- Yes?
- Something's happening with us.
It doesn't happen like that...
in one day.
Sometimes it does.
Proof.
Hi! How's it going?
OK. The new haircut is nice.
- Thanks.
- You're looking good.
- So are you, actually.
- I keep in shape.
10th and 11th in Caluire,
12th in Lausanne, 14th in Geneva...
Gilles, stop!
Your theatre: I don't care!
I'm just explaining.
I'll make the weeks up.
Changing the schedule
is out of the question.
Work it out with your new GF.
She has nothing else to do!
My "GF"?
Aren't you a French professor?
- You didn't want them alone with her.
- I've changed my mind.
It's so nice being selfish.
It took me more than twenty years with you
to realise that.
Why?
I don't know.
You've met someone.
You'd like to know!
I want to know how you're doing.
I have met someone,
if you want to know.
He's handsome...
he's tender.
And with him, everything is...
- It's always recess.
- Congratulations.
I'm freeing myself from you.
It's totally kickass.
So, the party?
It was totally lame.
Really? Why?
Average age 55... seriously!
- You're joking!
- Such a drag.
No shit.
You got hit on for sure.
Maybe.
Are you home now?
In bed already.
What are you wearing?
A low-cut sweatshirt and...
boyshorts.
Are you naked under the sweatshirt?
Yeah.
Take it off.
My hand is on your stomach,
do you feel it?
Yes, I can feel it.
It's moving up really slowly...
onto your breast.
Yes.
Your breasts are so pretty.
So round and firm.
I want to kiss them.
Kiss them.
I'm kissing your nipples.
Can you feel me sucking each one?
You know what would please me
while I suck your tits?
Put a hand in your shorts.
Oh, yes.
I want that, too.
- You want it, don't you?
- Yes.
Tell me.
I really want to...
slip a finger in my panties.
Do it.
How is it?
It's so warm.
Is it wet?
It's really warm and wet.
You're feeling your pussy?
Yes.
Do it, like that.
I love it when you please yourself.
Keep going!
I want to hear you moaning like that.
You're making me hard.
I'm in you!
Come on.
Come on.
It's so good.
It's really...
Alex.
My love.
My love.
I miss making love.
Not just...
But kissing, stroking...
Touching.
Or rather being touched.
What is love without desire?
You could talk about yourself for once.
I tell you everything, and you...
You say nothing.
I'm just the temporary repository
for a message not intended for me.
So you're completely inflexible.
No, I'm a doctor.
Your doctor.
Not your friend.
You've never slept
with one of your patients?
It happens often...
that people desire their therapist,
doesn't it?
It is said that...
it's sometimes part of the process.
The process...
Of healing.
For the patient,
but what about the doctor?
We learn something about ourselves
with each patient.
Sometimes the benefits are theoretical,
and sometimes...
the benefits are personal.
Did that turn you on?
It turns you on, that scene in the car
with Alex on the phone.
There are limits, Claire,
established by the deontology
of my profession.
So we can't see each other?
I can't next week.
I have to look after my niece.
- You promised.
- I really won't have much time.
I'm sorry, I...
We can't keep doing this.
I need to see you.
My life isn't simple just now.
You have to understand.
Believe me, I'm trying, but...
At least
tell me it's all you think about.
What?
You think she remembers
she has children?
I adore you, Alex,
I adore you.
I feel so good with you it's...
If you knew how much
I need to see you, feel you...
Nothing else exists.
I'm driving,
I have to call you back.
I'll call back, OK?
Yeah, yeah...
It was your father!
Come on!
Foul!
That's a foul!
Piece of shit referee!
Get some fucking glasses!
Mum, sit down.
He's staring daggers at me,
but it's true.
Do you have children, Doctor?
I presume a brilliant husband.
Or not?
It must be frustrating in the end,
not saying what you think.
If you knew what goes
through my mind sometimes...
you'd fall off your chair.
We were talking about children.
Yes, my sons.
My sons.
It was when they were
with their father that...
it got a little difficult.
Why difficult?
I let myself go.
How far?
So far that...
I felt more like Clara than Claire.
You think I'm like all the other girls.
Clara...
But you don't know me.
I know you're unique.
Yes.
We can't cut corners.
Even if it's hard for both of us.
It's driving me crazy.
Well then, a little present
for Mr Impatient.
You still haven't told me
where you got that picture.
Or the videos.
I told you.
Read your notes.
I found them randomly on Google.
Randomly.
Really?
Why would I lie to you?
It's that face he loved.
The picture of that young woman.
It's not...
It's not insignificant.
She was a complete stranger.
Right.
You had such easy access
to pictures and videos of a stranger?
What world do you live in, Dr Bormans?
Of course it's easy.
Facebook, Instagram: people parade
their lives. You can serve yourself.
Claire, first,
this is not an interrogation.
Second, I can't keep helping you
if you don't tell the truth.
To hell with it.
You're gonna love it.
It was a picture of my niece, Katia.
Happy now?
Fat lot of good it does you!
Your niece?
A pretty blonde.
Alex seemed to like blondes, that's all.
- That's all.
- Yes, that's all!
Can you tell me about your niece?
Yes, but I don't have much to say.
Katia is my brother's daughter.
When he had the helicopter accident
with his wife...
she was suddenly an orphan.
That's all.
I don't understand
what you mean.
I had my niece come stay.
She was grief-stricken,
I took care of her like a daughter,
but before that I hardly knew her.
Does she know you used her picture?
Katia never knew a thing.
Anyway, we don't see each other anymore.
As soon as the estate was settled,
Katia went to live in Norway.
So you appropriated
her face, her age, her story.
What were you looking for?
To live another life?
Not another one, mine!
At last!
I didn't even go outside yesterday.
It rained the whole day.
Here, too.
I thought...
maybe she'll find time to call me.
I have to get some sleep.
You want me to go?
I'm collapsing from fatigue.
Sometimes you talk
like someone's mum.
Will you still love me when...
when I'm old?
How old?
Fiftyish...
Fifty? That's still OK.
We've got our whole lives.
You were waiting for me?
Of course.
That's sweet.
What were you doing?
I was organising for my trip.
What trip?
I'm going to Goa,
at the end of the month.
Alone?
No, I'm going with my roommate.
You remember, Ludo.
I've told you about him.
- For how long?
- Two months.
Are you afraid
you can't do without me?
Clara?
Clara?
How long have you been planning it?
A long time.
And you're only telling me now?
I didn't see you coming, gorgeous.
You know what?
Come with me.
I can't, I...
You can, just quit your internship.
We only live once.
What does it really change for us
if I'm in Goa?
I'm just afraid,
thinking of you far away.
So far.
It's not like we can hold each other,
you know?
Do you... miss me?
I mean, you want to see me?
Obviously.
Obviously. Don't you?
I do, but I...
I'm so afraid...
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.
Of course not.
I'm sure I won't be.
I also freak out
that you'll be disappointed.
Clara?
What are you doing here?
Can we go outside?
I want some fresh air.
OK, come on.
I just can't forget him.
What can't you forget?
He'd become the centre of my universe.
During his trip to Goa,
we spoke every day.
Several times a day even.
I would have liked it
to stay that way forever.
When he got back from Goa,
Alex got very insistent.
It was...
harder and harder to calm him down.
Surprised?
My flight landed this morning.
Alex is on his way to Clara.
Alex will be there in three minutes.
I was there,
in the same city as you.
I couldn't. Not today.
No, hold on.
This is too weird!
You're a psychopath.
You've been playing with me
the whole time?
You're a head case!
No, I...
Hello?
What are you doing here?
It's Sunday.
Exactly!
I've been waiting for you!
I was even getting worried!
Forget it.
What's going on?
Hello?
Who was that?
What are you doing?
Some friends just showed up.
Why are you whispering?
You're having a party!
I've got to go.
I'll call you back later, OK?
Are you joking?
Are you fucking with me?
I'm seriously getting fed up!
It's always the way you want!
We can't even talk now?
What's your problem?
There's nothing in the fridge.
I'll make crepes!
There aren't even any eggs.
- Make what?
- Huh?
Alex...
I have to tell you something.
What?
I'm with someone...
I've got a boyfriend.
We live together.
Since when?
It was a few months before you...
I can't really remember.
And this is how you tell me?
- Couldn't you have told me earlier?
- I tried.
Have you told him about me?
No.
No, Gilles is really jealous, you know?
He's paranoid.
Things aren't very good
between us, so...
Well, now I...
I get why you didn't want to see me.
Fuck, and I've been waiting for you
like a fool for weeks.
Forgive me, Alex.
This really hurts.
Forgive me.
I'm going to hang up.
I've gotta get my head around this.
Forgive me.
Hi Clara.
I don't know how you're doing,
but I feel lost.
I don't understand
the hold you have on me.
I can't do anything anymore.
I'm going nuts.
I'll be in Paris next Thursday.
My train arrives at Montparnasse
at 3:02pm.
Don't try to call or write before then.
If you care about me...
just be there.
You can't imagine
how desperately I want to meet you.
It had become unbearable. It had to stop.
There was no other way out.
It broke my heart.
But after I saw him in that bus,
so young, so vulnerable...
I understood that the time had come.
It was causing me too much pain.
Alex, something completely
unexpected happened.
Yesterday...
Gilles asked me to marry him.
I said yes.
We're going to live in Brazil.
He took a new job there.
I know I'm making the right choice.
You and I lived a dream.
A dream with our eyes wide open.
It was marvellous.
But it was only a dream.
Don't be too angry with me, Alex.
There will always be
a part of you in me.
I went back to my old life
the way you close a novel.
Wounded,
overcome...
old.
When I wanted to renew contact,
it was too late.
His profile was gone.
By disappearing, Alex was more radical
than I was in a way.
And stronger, also.
Hi.
I was just busy, that's all.
Exactly.
Such sagacity!
I didn't hesitate long.
It was the only way
to get information about Alex.
- You look fantastic.
- That's nice.
But I haven't had a break all year,
with publishing and classes...
And you?
Is the building work going well?
It's fine.
You look tired. Are you OK?
I'm OK.
Things are a little difficult just now.
Difficult?
Do you remember my buddy Alex?
- The photographer?
- Yes, kind of.
He had a car accident.
He drove right off a cliff.
Can you believe it?
He offed himself over some psychopath
he met on Facebook
that he never even saw.
The cops knew right away.
He didn't brake.
He's dead.
Sorry...
Hello?
When someone dies,
what do we do
with their virtual identity?
Leave it as it is?
Delete it?
What choices do we have?
Wait!
I... I wrote this here.
It was... It was vital.
Necessary.
I'd really like to have your opinion
for once. It's important.
I'll read it.
TRUE SECRETS
BY CLAIRE MILLAUD
For a long time, the idea that nothing
would happen between us was unbearable.
Breaking it off was like
renouncing life.
After all,
I found him immensely attractive.
Why give him up?
What would it cost me to try?
The fear of not being able
to take Clara's place?
Alex was going to be unhappy?
I would be there to console him.
Pardon me.
- I feel like I know you.
- Sorry?
I think I know you.
Are you friends with Ludo?
- Ludovic? Yes, I am.
- I knew it.
I'm his old...
An old friend.
You don't remember?
- The oysters?
- Do you remember, on the phone?
Oh, right.
Yeah.
Are you still living with him
in the Somme?
He hasn't kicked me out, yet.
You must really be good-natured.
You're a photographer, right?
Kind of, yeah.
I'm trying to put together a show.
Ludo told me about you.
He showed me some of your pictures.
I really liked them, actually.
Thanks.
I get off at the next stop.
Do you do portraits?
I mean, not only candid street shots,
but portraits of...
Yeah, I do...
I do portraits, portfolios...
I do everything, I think,
except weddings.
I'm going to need a picture
for my next book.
They usually send
their own photographer, but this time...
It's funny running into you.
Maybe you could...
Yeah, definitely.
I'm actually looking for work,
so that would be cool.
Great!
Should I take your number?
If you want.
I forgot your name!
Claire. Claire.
- My name is Claire.
- Claire.
Thanks.
But above all, there's Nora,
in Ibsen's "A Doll's House".
The doll, the good wife...
the responsible mother:
it's her.
The play presents
the awakening of her consciousness.
The emancipation of a woman outside
the role defined for her by society.
And now, more than a century later,
we still relate
to her refusal to conform,
to subject herself to the norms
in which they imprison us.
How did he do it?
Sorry? Who?
Ludo. How did he manage to date
a beautiful woman like you?
You're super-photogenic.
Really nice.
Could we just...
undo your top button.
- The blouse?
- Yeah.
The book is for an academic audience,
I don't know if...
All the more reason
to entice the reader, right?
That's nice.
Great.
And, um...
Go ahead, get comfortable.
More relaxed, like this?
-Yes. Great.
- OK.
Sorry, I moved.
It's OK.
And, um...
Are you married?
Children? Divorced?
All of the above.
Win, place, and show!
In that order, even!
And all before age thirty.
You're hiding something, Claire.
Can I...
Can I try something?
- Do you want a break?
- No, quite the opposite, keep going.
I have nothing to hide.
I was married for twenty years
to a man who was everything to me.
I'd been with other men before him,
but it was so long ago...
I've forgotten almost all of them.
I gave birth to two children.
Two boys.
I thought that nursing them
would make me a good mother.
My breasts have never been the same -
the skin on my belly, either.
My husband left me for a woman
young enough to be my daughter.
When it happened, I thought...
I thought I'd die from the sorrow.
I'm too passionate.
Passionate is the word.
But I can also be very happy.
So, I think...
you know just about everything.
It's crazy.
What?
Nothing. Us meeting.
It's crazy.
It's landscape,
but you can cut it for a portrait.
It's crisper.
I like this one.
Really, it's beautiful.
We have the same one with a smile,
which is my favourite.
Do you agree?
We made love day and night.
We had to make up for lost time.
We moved in together very quickly,
or rather...
he came to live with me.
"Extinguish my eyes,
I still can see you
"Close my ears,
I can hear your footsteps fall,
"And without feet
I still can follow you,
"And without voice
I still can to you call."
Your turn to read.
- Keep going.
- You, please.
- Go on.
- Come on.
"Break off my arms, and I enfold you
with my heart as with a hand.
"Hold my heart, my brain will beat
"Ignite that brain,
"My blood will carry you."
I love you.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
Do you know what I love most
about you?
It's bizarre,
but it's your voice.
Claire's voice, Clara's voice...
Of course Alex was still
thinking about her.
Was I so naive as to believe my face
would somehow replace hers?
How could I forget
I was a consolation
for having lost her?
Worse, that through me,
he loved her.
There is no greater rival
than one who does not exist.
Alex, I couldn't forget you.
It's over with Gilles.
I'm back in Paris, I love you,
I miss you unbearably.
I don't know how you feel,
but if you still love me
meet me at the Café Français.
I'll be there
from 6pm to 8pm.
Don't try to call me.
If you don't come,
you'll never have to hear from me again.
I promise you that.
Your Clara.
Are you ready?
Yes.
- Let's go.
- OK.
We could stay in?
I'd rather eat out.
It's better.
Yeah.
Except that you're the one
I want to devour.
Maybe we could catch a film?
Sure.
Can you check what's playing?
I'm going to go get a sweater.
I'm cold.
NIGHT SOULS
RECENTLY ADDED
Welcome back, Clara.
We hear screams, squealing brakes,
the thud on impact.
And finally, silence.
A film of it could end like that.
And in reality?
Why not imagine a happy end?
Even in an imaginary world,
you deny yourself happiness.
As if you wanted to hurt yourself.
Again.
Over and over.
Who hurt you, Claire?
Who made you suffer?
You know, what I stole from Katia...
It took me a while to understand, but...
my niece's attitude...
towards me,
became more and more hostile
as time went by.
Gilles is her uncle by marriage.
I've heard it often enough,
no consanguinity.
"She loves me, I love her,
"no aggravating circumstances,
only the circumstance of love."
Those are his words.
Actually...
A 27-year age difference
for 20 years of marriage.
Katia didn't go back to Norway,
she moved in with my husband.
I never managed to tell you.
Or even to write it down.
They destroyed me.
She destroyed me.
It was her, your rival,
that you chose as your avatar.
Yes.
I wanted her beauty,
I wanted her youth...
I envied her happiness.
She'd stolen mine.
I was jealous.
It all happens
as if you're refusing reality,
as if you're fleeing the truth.
The desire for eternity,
the illusion of eternal youth.
Yes.
We all want to distance ourselves...
from the prospect of our death.
I'm OK with dying.
But not with being abandoned.
We're never too old to be little.
I needed to be taken care of,
to be soothed,
even with delusions.
How long has it been?
She was admitted to the clinic...
about nine months ago.
It went pretty far.
Alex was completely in her grip.
It was so bad that he had me listen
to one of her messages.
I immediately recognised her voice.
At first I didn't want to believe it.
I thought it was a game...
something a little warped.
I didn't tell Alex,
but I tried to get him to realise
that this girl, this Clara...
was a little too perfect.
So he started to have doubts.
When Clara disappeared,
he deleted his profile.
A few months later she called me.
I told her he was dead because of her...
that he'd committed suicide.
My buddy was going nuts, and I...
I don't like being cheated on.
So I lied.
I don't understand.
He didn't die in a car accident?
No.
He actually just became a dad.
He's living
in the south of France.
He got married.
His first child was born last month.
A girl.
We think we're guilty,
but we're not.
I came to say goodbye.
Sometimes a patient bears within her
something we had
but that we'd lost.
You know, I took your advice.
I starting working
on my manuscript again, and...
It helped me to know that
everything is possible again.
There's not just one possible ending.
No.
Goodbye, Claire.
Goodbye, Doctor.
