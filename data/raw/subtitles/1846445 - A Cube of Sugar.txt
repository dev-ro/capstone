Reza Mir-Karimi - Shadmehr Rastin
Based on a Sketch by
Reza Mir-Karimi -- Shadmehr Rastin
Lesson twenty-eight.
Say "Hi" instead of "Hello"...
...in informal conversations.
She asked what the matter was...
...and what was wrong.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm not bad.
How did they make Pasand
agree with this?
I was not worried about Pasand at all.
She always listens to others.
I don't know what made my uncle
change his mind.
Mother knows how to talk him
into something.
Mom?!
I'm coming.
What are you doing there, Ali?
Don't! Don't!
- Ali!
- Hi.
How are you, auntie?
- Hi.
- Where are you going?
Why did you take your clothes off?
Didn't you learn your lesson last year?
- Hi.
- I have missed you.
- You have lost weight.
- Shush!
What are you doing?
Don't you..
Why isn't it right?
Do you expect me to cry or something?
It's not like we are mourning or anything.
She is getting married, for God's sake!
See? You said we were late,
but we got here first.
Could we be your bridesmaids, ma'am?!
-  Oh, God! Look at them!
-  This isn't her.
-  She will be the next bride.
-  Don't you laugh at us!
We had a flat tire.
Otherwise we would get here
sooner than you.
- Hold the baby.
- No need.
Get the luggage and the blanket
from the car.
- Hello!
- Come in, Hajj Naser!
- Did you have a good pilgrimage?
- Hi, Mother.
Thank you.
-  I hope we could go together next time.
-  You are late again, Hajji!
Were you driving in top gear again?
You could break down your car engine, man.
- Hi.
- Sister Marzieh!
- Come on.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
- I have missed you a lot.
-  Hi.
-  Hi.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Please go get your mother.
Why? Don't you want to come in?
I will come in later.
I don't want your grandma to find out.
Ok.
Instead of taking care of me,
he just hurts me.
You shouldn't cry in front of
the children.
I'll show him.
Go get some sugar-cubes
from auntie, sweetie.
-  He always yells at me.
-  Go now! Good girl!
They make him do it.
He hurts me all the time.
He even shaved his hair
on the wedding day.
I know why he's doing this.
He wants to make me mad.
-  Hello.
-  Hajj Naser!
- Excuse me.
- Hi, Mahnaz.
- Hi.
- I didn't see Hamid here.
- He'll come later.
- Look at Marzieh!
-  You are almost as tall as your mother.
-  Thanks.
Wow! Look at the food.
It smells great.
- What's the problem?
- I can't find my cell-phone.
- Maybe you left it at home.
- No, I had it in the car.
- Maybe it's still in the car.
- I already looked.
It wasn't there. Isn't it back there?
It must be somewhere around here.
Don't worry, you'll find it.
It isn't here.

-  Is my uncle alright?
-  Just do the dishes.
Who came?
Was it Mahnaz?
Yeah.
She's at the kitchen.
- So?
- Nothing.
Look at all these sugar-cubes.
Your husband is a very
accurate man, auntie.
- They're all the same size!
- Her hearing-device isn't working.
She can't hear you.
That's Azam's husband.
- Did you enjoy your pilgrimage?
- It's not him.
Shamsi lives in Qom.
Shamsi promised she'd
take her to pilgrimage.
You naughty!
You remember things
that benefit you only.
- Listen!
- Masoumeh called last night.
Would you like some tea?
She said she'd come tomorrow,
because of Masoud's exams.
I think it's because of Naser.
You should give Hormoz a call.
How dare Hormoz?
He could call.
- I'll make him come.
- Here you are.
- I just made tea.
- Thank you.
Why does your brother look
so upset, by the way?
-  You said he was fine with it.
-  He is.
He's been breaking the sugarloaves
since yesterday.
- Pasand!
- Yes?
Don't touch his things.
He'll be mad.
Come on!
I need some practice for tonight.
Would you like to have a daughter or a son?
If I break it with two strikes,
she'll have a daughter.
That's true you have good son-in-laws.
But she's gonna need a son
in such a faraway place.
Look how they compliment themselves!
Give it to me. Just watch and
learn how I'll break it.
Auntie!
He went to Karbala.
But he not only hasn't brought us anything,
but also he hasn't changed at all.
But he not only hasn't brought us anything,
but also he hasn't changed at all.
- Left or right? Which one?
- Come on, you smarty-pants!
You should take it with your left hand.
Even Ali could do it with his right hand.
You can't do it.
Look what you did!
She'll have a son.
He'll be a bit small, actually!
Remember, auntie?
He broke a sugarloaf for Hamid and
me too and we only have daughters.
Look at the mother and daughter
speaking alone.
Where have those been all along?
If you make a mess breaking the sugarloaf
tonight, we'll show you. Using these!
You don't need a gun to make me
obey you, darling.
I can't believe that your uncle agreed
to put them up on the wall.
- I guess he really likes the guy.
- I want to put it somewhere too.
- Let me...
- How I love you!
You want to show off to
the neighbors, don't you?
Of course not.
This isn't any of their business.
- Yes, it is.
- There!
It looks great!
I take responsibility for that.
Naser!
Naser!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Let me kiss your hand.
- No need.
My hands are wet.
People used to go to pilgrimage with
horses and donkeys...
- How are you?
- You should take care of the stew, Jafar.
We have a lot to do.
Why don't you ever ask Hajji
to do anything?
Wish you were there with us.
I prayed for you at Imam Ali's holy shrine.
How long did it take you to get there?
We took off at noon and the
next day in midnight, we were...
- Two days it was.
- Yes, two days.
We bought you this from Karbala.
We wanted to put off the
pilgrimage to some other time...
...when we have more money but
it was getting late...
...as we had taken a vow to go there
after our children were born.
-  We got this from Najaf.
-  From the same man you told us about.
- No, that's not true.
- It is.
That man is dead,
we got this from his son.
- It wasn't his son.
- Mom!
I am tall enough to walk in the pool now.
I won't drown again!
- I swear it's true.
- Ok.
- Go dry your body.
- Pasand!
Pasand!
It's from them.
Look at that!
Look at that!
That's too bad to have
a rich brother-in-law!
-  Bravo, Jafar!
-  You should pick it up.
Poor he!
You can't leave a long
distance call unanswered.
-  The color looks great on you, mom.
-  The waist is too tight, honey.
- I am too old to wear this.
- I don't know about you.
But my mom is still very young.
Look at her!
- She's standing right here.
- Auntie!
- Yes, honey?
- Isn't your husband abroad?
- Yes, he is.
- Is Karbala abroad too?
- It is, honey.
- I told you!
You shouldn't take all
your pictures with you.
Your luggage will be just heavy.
Let me put this here.
Everything I did, I did for your happiness.
I love you.
Your late dad would be happy too,
if he were here.
Mom!
Mom!
Auntie!
Auntie!
Masoum shouldn't listen to everything
her husband says.
She should have come.
They need to be here when we are
breaking the sugarloaf.
Look! They have a lot of guests.
Since Hormoz went to jail he's been
acting even worse.
He's been like this, since I can
remember.
That's why his first wife left him.
- Who?
- Poor Masoumeh!
- She didn't want him to quit his job.
- He didn't quit.
- They fired him.
- No, sister...
Mom!
Ali went by the pool.
- You can go to him too.
-  Auntie! Auntie!
Can I see your cell-phone?
- It's in the room, honey.
- So, Pasand!
- What was the groom telling you?
-  Yeah...
-  Tell us what he said.
-  Nothing.
Just things, you know!
Wait!
What things?!
It's ok.
The groom doesn't speak Farsi well.
"I have been in love with you since I
were a child, Mademoiselle Pasand!"
"Now let me have a kiss,
if you don't mind!”
"Now let me have a kiss,
if you don't mind!”
(Singing)
How I love her!
She doesn't talk at all.
She is very shy.
Look at her!
It won't remain the same.
When she sees how marriage
life really is...
...she will both wear beautiful clothes
and learn to argue.
- She will change.
- That poor guy!
Don't say that, sister.
It is hard to live away from your country.
Why?
It's actually great.
She'll be away from her in-laws, at least.
And if her husband bosses her around, she
can call the police and get him arrested.
Give me that.
Hello? Is that the police station?
My sister bothers us a lot.
How could we file a complaint?
-  Give that to me.
-  Pardon?
Hold on a second.
What?
What are you doing?
Give it to me.
Excuse me, sir...
I guess you don't have any woman
colleagues, so...
-  Watch the food.
-  Ali!
Only if I catch you!
Ali!
It was your mom's fault.
I wanted to get her arrested.
Shamsi! She's hanging
your children's clothes.
Go!
What are you looking for?
You'll get sick if you touch a frog.
It gives you warts.
There are a lot of frogs here
at the beginning of the spring.
There aren't many of them here now.
Remember?
I'm here, you silly!
Is that your dad?
Isn't he afraid of going there alone?
There are a lot of ghosts in the
stock-house.
Do you want me to catch you a frog?
A frog.
What was that?
They say whoever tramples over a frog,
will lose his dad.
Tell me--
Have you been to that stock-house?
Have you seen the ghosts?
Tell me the truth.
I haven't seen them.
They aren't there in daylight.
You can mostly find them at night time.
Ghasem...
who just took off to military service...
...used to study there.
Maybe he's seen the ghosts.
Take this.
Marzieh!
Please watch the babies for a second.
I'll be right back.
Hi, honey.
Hi, sweetie!
Look at her!
What are you doing?
Crazy kid!
You are unbelievable!
This one is blocked.
Hold it for a second, Ali.
Come on.
Watch them.
I'll be right back.
You behave, Ali!
Drink this.
Drink it.
That's enough.
You can have some too.
There, there!
Don't cry...
That's enough.
Let your sister drink some too.
I can't believe it!
Your sister is hungry too.
You need to wait for your turn.
Do we have more rice, Azam?
We have two buckets full.
Bring the second one too.
We're gonna need it.
- Mom!
- What?
- Take.
- What is it?
Nothing.
Just to take care of the ceremony.
I can pay for that.
Jafar needs this money.
Jafar will get offended
if you don't accept it.
- You have lots of expenses.
- Why should Jafar get offended?
Just forget it.
I'll go get the rice.
Azam!
God won't leave me empty-handed.
Just think that God sent you that too.
Twenty four..
- One... two...
- A lot of great girls here.
-  Isn't it true, honey?
-  I'm hungry.
I'll set the table soon.
Are you counting?
How many times did she bend?
- Twice.
- Bravo!
- Two!
- Wish we had brought Jafar something.
- He keeps talking about it.
- Come on!
It's Karbala.
The best gift you could bring
from there is its soil.
- What are you doing?
- What?!
What are you laughing at, kid?
It will happen to you too.
You naughty!
- Who is that?
- That's the guy who brought the lamps.
He is such a liar!
- Is he a bold kid?
- Oh, yeah!
I went in the pool and
the water was this high!
- How high?
- This high!
Hormoz will come.
I talked to him and
convinced him to come.
Reza! Ali!
Lunch is ready.
I hope he feels like coming,
because if he doesn't...
Here you are, auntie.
He will ruin the wedding,
if he doesn't feel like it.
- Give me my lunch.
- Sure.
He has a good heart.
You shouldn't mess with him.
I didn't say anything.
He starts joking and then he gets
offended all of a sudden!
There is room for him at the table.
It means that he will come.
Mom!
Mom!
What does it mean when there is extra
room at the table?
- It means that a guest will come.
-  Great!
- We will have more guests!
-  Keep it down.
- Did you wash your hands, Ali?
- Yes.
Can I have some fries, auntie?
I want water.
Sure.
Is that true that mom's uncle
has killed a bear with his bare hands?
- Eat your food.
- Mom!
- What does a bear look like?
- I don't know.
It looks like a dog...
It's just a little bigger than that.
The chicken isn't salty, brother.
Kitty!
Would you like something else?
Didn't Ghasem come?
I told him to come.
-  Maybe he couldn't take a leave...
-  You should have called him.
-  I don't want him to feel uncomfortable.
-  He couldn't take a leave.
Even if he can't come tonight...
...he will definitely be here tomorrow
when they'll register the marriage.
You should call so that
he won't be upset.
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Come here.
- Hello.
-  Welcome.
-  Thanks.
I brought you some new
English Conversation CDs.
Did you listen to the last ones?
Were they any good?
- Hi.
- Hi, sister.
Congratulations.
- Did Hormoz come?
-  I made him come because of you.
I hope he won't get into
a fight with Hajj Naser.
Hey!
Come here.
-  Who just came?
- Auntie Masoumeh.
Great, Missy!
You are doing the right thing.
You shouldn't stay in
this godforsaken place.
You wouldn't come if Jafar
didn't call, would you?
Jafar?!
We took off half an hour
before he called.
I didn't tell him because I knew
he would enjoy bragging about it.
You said the engagement party was
tomorrow...
...and the marriage was
the day after that.
- Didn't you?
-  They couldn't find tickets for Thursday.
That's why we're holding it
one day sooner.
We're gonna watch the game!
-  Hi, auntie.
-  Hi, honey.
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.
-  How was your exam, Reza?
-  It was ok.
Why are you standing there, honey?
Didn't you say you had to pee?
-  There's a hole in there.
-  No one can see through it.
Go.
- So, Samira should stand over there.
- Ok. Go.
Samira!
Could you please stand over there, honey?
I'll stand in front of the
hole, so that no one see you.
I told her the same thing.
But she didn't listen to me.
How I love you!
You've become such a lady!
Look at her beautiful hair!
I'm sure mom will buy you
a beautiful scarf soon.
You said you'd stand in
front of the hole, mom.
I'm coming, honey.
You make me fall in love with you,
whenever you wear those shades!
- Who bought you those?
-  My dad.
And aunt Pasand made me a wedding dress!
- It has decorations and everything!
- Great!
- It's very fluffy and I have a tiara too.
- I have one too.
- Mind your business!
- Why didn't your dad come?
- He was busy.
- You need to shake.
Go on and shake hands.
There you go!
-  He's just come back from pilgrimage.
-  May God accept your prayers!
I prayed for you a lot.
Maybe I would still be behind the bars,
if it weren't for your prayers!
Of course not.
Ok, I won't read you any more
of my text messages.
- Just forward them to him!
- Help yourselves!
I brought an LCD TV so that we can
watch the game together.
Masoud!
Where are you going?
Why didn't you eat?
- I'll eat later.
- Masoud!
-  Hi.
-  Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you?
I hope you enjoyed your pilgrimage.
How are you, auntie?
Congratulations, mom!
How are you?
Stop!
Eat this.
Don't touch it!
Aren't you done?
I want to decorate the place.
There is no one to help me.
- What?
- Nothing.
It is two gigabytes.
It will take some time.
-  Marzieh!
-  You should go outside sometimes.
These days, they teach such things to
young people before they get married.
- How does it look?
- Some even have tutors.
What are you laughing at?
Are you laughing at me?
- Of course not.
- Wow! She looks great!
[Giggly talks]
Come on!
Are you laughing at me?
Of course not.
By the way...
How old is the groom?
I don't even remember
how he looks like.
Isn't Keyvan the tall
guy with green eyes?
Keyvan isn't tall at all!
The one Shamsi is talking about
is Shahrokh.
Oh no!
Are you awake?
Oh no!
Are you awake?
You must be ashamed of yourself!
I can't sleep with you here.
She is right.
Shahrokh was the tall one.
He was the best looking
among them all.
- Stop it, Azam!
- Why?
I'm telling the truth.
Maybe it's bitter, but it's true.
Shush!
She's not wearing her
hearing device, is she?
You know, Pasand!
They will ask you personal questions...
...in order to make sure that you didn't
get married just to go abroad.
-  Why? What are they going to ask?
-  Just questions.
Where you met... How you fell in love.
You should tell the truth.
Tell them you don't care about love.
- All it matters is that he is a Vaziri!
- I can't believe you!
-  Where are you going, auntie?
-  You will get tired.
Anything you need, auntie?
Here's your cell-phone, auntie.
I didn't find mine.
The grooms rich.
You should have bought a wedding gown,
instead of making one.
-  Who is going to make my clothes?
-  Forget about you.
- What about Samira?
-  It's ok.
Her auntie will send her
designer's clothes from abroad.
Don't forget it, honey.
How should I do it?
Use pearl and confetti...
Ouch!
-  Mahnaz!
-  It's kicking hard.
Do  you think the ultrasound results
might be wrong?
- Maybe.
- Don't get your hopes high, sister.
These days, girls kick harder than boys!
Samira!
Come here.
Did you shave your hair, because
you didn't have any customers?
- Give it to me.
- I said come here.
I want to cheer you up, so...
I can't believe that even my own child
has no respect for me.
Listen!
Let me read you some text messages.
"Before getting married, open your
eyes."
"And close them, after you get married."
-  Where are you going?
-  Come on.
Give me one.
Match!
Guess you have quit buying
cigarettes, not smoking them!
I made a lot of friends in jail.
Scientists, doctors,
engineers, poor and rich...
They're all into texting.
Prison is like college.
- Did you get your PhD?
- Listen to this one!
"Marriage is made up of
three weeks of courting..."
"Three months of love..."
"Three years of war... ”
-  "And thirty years of..."
-  What are you doing?
- Come here.
- Let him be.
He could hurt himself.
He almost got himself killed last year.
The whole family is crazy.
Their daughters are insensitive.
And they all give birth to girls.
Those who have sons have raised
monsters instead of boys!
Listen!
"When you are single, the only
thing you lack is a wife."
"But once you get married, the
only thing you have is a wife."
- That's by Plato!
- No, brother!
Only if I find her, I'll show you
that I have everything!
So, tell me--
I thought you found the old books and
sold them while I was in jail.
They're not among the other stuff
in the stock-house.
They are buried there.
-  Watch out for the tree, Ali!
-  I'll go find them when no one is here.
I don't want mother to find out.
Oh no! She's coming.
-  You are in trouble.
- Deeply!
Mahnaz!
The decorations shouldn't be
in the middle of the room.
Take them to the side.
Look at my sister's beautiful eyes!
Why are you looking at me like that?
My little sister is getting married.
Such a beautiful lady!
How I love you.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
- Did they bring the decorations?
-  It's your husband.
- Who? Hamid?
- He's your only husband, isn't he?!
Sit down.
Put it down.
- I'm busy here.
-  Look at him.
-  He's trying to look innocent.
-  Mahnaz!
Let him be.
Come and iron your dress.
Good for you!
You deserve it.
He yells at me all the time.
Pasand!
You should take this to
the Louvre museum.
They might buy it from you.
-  The Louvre museum isn't in the US.
-  Any museum would work!
You should do the ironing, Shamsi.
Come here.
- Take this.
- Thank you.
I went to the Vaziris' house once,
when I was a child.
-  I think it was about twenty years ago.
-  I went there a lot.
The last time, I went there
for Shahrokh's wedding.
- I told you I wanted to decorate this.
-  Ok, do as you wish.
-  Please iron this.
-  Such politeness is admirable!
-  Mahnaz!
-  Yes?
- Aren't my eyebrows asymmetrical?
- Let me see..
Yes, this one is shorter.
You shouldn't let the school servant
wax your eyebrows.
-  She took 5.000 Tomans for this.
-  Let me see.
They don’t even listen to you
when they are busy.
-  This one is shorter.
-  No, it's this one.
- Oh!
- Does it look good?
-  Can I go with you, mom?
-  Of course not.
Grandma will get mad.
Are you going to wear these?
Yeah, what's wrong with them?
I look better than you.
-  Look at my skin..
-  Pasand!
Does the groom even remember you?
Maybe he's mistaken her for one of us!
Yeah, and that would be you!
Give me your necklace.
They have seen that before.
Come and take this.
Thanks, honey.
You should lend me your earrings too.
Tell me if you need something else.
Let me go with you, mom.
- Say something, auntie.
- Please take Marzieh with you, sister.
-  I'll see.
-  You should take a young girl with you.
-  It brings luck.
-  It's not like we are old!
Hello, Mrs. Vaziri!
What a surprise!
I can't believe it!
All these girls in the neighboring house
have been waiting for your sons to propose.
Cyrus, Shahrokh, Shahab...
- Fereydoun.
- Right, Fereydoun.
You waited so long that all the good
ones got married.
-  That's the only remaining one.
-  Shall I get dressed or not, mom?
- Did you say your prayers?
- I will.
-  Hurry!
-  Ouch!
There is a hole in your sock,
you beauty queen!
Oh no!
I don't have any other socks here.
- Anybody has tan socks I can borrow?
-  Not tan, but I have black ones.
- I really shouldn't come wearing these?
-  No, we are going to the Vaziris' house.
-  You aren't going to work.
-  You already took all I had.
You can have these too.
Anybody who'd like to lend
me their high-heels?!
Good girl! Good!
What's the rush, honey?
Take your time.
-  Hi.
-  Where are you going?
- To Mahnaz.
- With your shoes on?
You didn't help us wash the rugs and
now you want to walk on them...
...wearing your shoes?!
Hi, Shamsi.
How was your pilgrimage?
- How are you?
- Look at her!
- Why didn't you come here for lunch?
- I was busy with work.
- Mahnaz is changing her clothes.
- Ok, thanks.
-  Hamid!
-  Sorry!
- Azam! Pasand! Everyone! Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Mahnaz!
- Mahnaz!
- What?
- What do you want?
- Didn't you bring me a clean shirt?
- You said you weren’t going.
- l can’t go wearing this.
No, you can't.
Poor he! He doesn't have
a shirt to wear.
That was his excuse to talk to me.
He was supposed to be there with the
shirt he is wearing.
- Just let go of it, Mahnaz.
-  Auntie!
-  Be careful!
-  Fereshteh! Honey!
Come here.
They'll find you soon, if you both
hide in the same place.
Mom is going out.
I'll be back soon.
- Ok.
- Go find somewhere else to hide.
Ok?
- Ok.
- Let's go.
Don't come.
How many times do you
have to count them?
Wish I had some more.
Counting won't make them
grow more in number!
-  Where should I hide?
-  You want to hide somewhere?
Come here.
Come here.
-  I'm coming.
-  Don't!
-  What did you do about the fruits?
-  We washed them all.
They're in the fridge.
How I love you!
-  Don't say anything to embarrass us.
-  No one will embarrass you.
What else?
- Go! Go! Go!
- What about me?
I'm here.
What's up, Reza?
-  Are you looking for something?
-  No.
So, come and help me with these lights.
Come on.
Take them.
Who turned these on?
We could get electro-shocked!
[Singing]
Masoud.
Are you here?
Look if I'm right.
Ghorban-Ali is very punctual.
He turns the power off at
the same time everyday.
This is the university I have applied for.
- Oh! It's your resume?
- Pasand!
- Give me a light, please.
- Ok, sister.
Take it to her.
- Your suit is in the room.
- I don't like wearing suits.
I'll take one of these, auntie.
Thank you.
Listen carefully!
I don't want my hair short.
Ok.
I won't change anything.
-  Don't touch the hair up here, Hamid.
- I know how to do my work.
It brings bad luck
if you cut hair at night.
It's ok, auntie.
It's for the wedding.
Wait!
What did you just do?
- You cut my hair too short.
-  No, I didn't.
- I haven't even started yet.
- You know what?
No need.
I look fine.
You need to cut your hair
for tomorrow, don't you?
Let Hamid take care of it for you.
I can't let him touch my hair
even when it's light.
-  Let alone doing it in this dark.
-  It will be finished soon.
That's exactly why I don't need that.
Why don't you leave me alone?
- Hamid!
Let him be.
- Leave me alone.
- It's their fault.
I didn't do anything.
Now I know who my wife took
after in being so stubborn.
Even bears can't get away from him.
How could you?
Don't be so naive.
If he had killed a bear, he wouldn't
have kept bulls' pictures!
I give him every right to be afraid, if
you cut hair like you do electric works.
I plugged something in
and the fuse went off.
That's not the fuse.
It's an-electricity cut.
We've had power shortage
for two weeks now.
- Didn't you know that?
- Why?
They opened a powerhouse
a month ago.
They did.
But then they remembered that they
needed to change the cables too.
So, are we to break
the sugarloaf in the dark?
Don't worry.
My cousin is the power factory manager.
He will make an exception for us tonight.
- Masoud!
Get down.
-  What a country has it become, Hajji!
-  It's not like phone lines that they can.
C) They cannot let go of their worldly
attachments.
-  D) All the above.
-  Of course it's D.
Which of the followings are the reasons
for development of western countries...
...in comparison to the Islamic nations?
A) Science and development is not
more than a mirage in west.
Excuse me...
B) The western countries owe their
progress to the old age Islamic scientists.
C) The Islamic nations have been
colonized throughout history.
D)  Al-lsra Surah, Verse 20.
Well, I don't know what that verse is.
We need to look it up in the Holy Quran.
What is obvious is that God helps
everyone.
That's the divine tradition.
How should I put it?
The more you try, the more
God provides for you.
Time is up.
You only have twenty seconds
for each question.
I could never raise them,
without your help.
You helped them all get married.
Pasand was born in your house.
-  This isn't my size.
-  It is fine.
That's just what you think.
Even you picked her name.
Here's your watch.
Great!
They may even mistakenly take you
for the groom.
-  This watch doesn't work.
-  It doesn't matter.
It looks nice.
I can't be happy, unless you
are happy, brother.
What are you doing, Hamid?
Give it up for Ghorban-Ali, the
electricity company manager!
I love you, brother.
We all respect you.
Let's leave the disagreements behind.
-  Take it away.
-  This isn't my fault.
Take this hat.
They shouldn't have brought it here.
Unbelievable!
It looks great on you.
Where are you going?
He was pulling my thread!
Oh no!
Azam said I should take care of her.
Auntie!
It's over.
You said your prayers.
You should end it.
I wasn't here, Hajji.
I don't know if she's done.
It is ok.
It's still acceptable from her.
Auntie!
Please pray for me.
-  Don't touch the guests' shoes.
-  What are you doing?
Let me wear these.
You'll see.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you please call Jafar?
-  Azam!
-  Jafar!
-  How do I look?
-  How did you change so much?!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Welcome.
- Congratulations.
- Make yourself comfortable, please.
What are you doing?
- Here you are.
- No, thanks.
- Give him one.
- Come on!
- You can have one as this is a wedding.
- I just told you.
I have diabetes.
Here you are.
-  Have some sweets, please.
-  No, thanks.
- Mansour.
- Yes?
-  What are you doing?
-  That's none of your business.
- What do you want?
- I want to use the bathroom.
Feel free!
Here's the groom.
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!
-  This is from the bride's oldest sister.
-  Please pass this.
-  Here comes the sugarloaf!
-  Pass it to Hajji to break it.
-  Peace be upon Prophet Muhammad!
-  Peace be upon Prophet Muhammad!
-  You should do it.
-  My arm hurts.
Let someone else do it.
With your and Mr. Vaziri's permission...
...let the oldest son-in-law break it.
Go on.
Thanks.
Wish them happiness.
Let's hear it for the happiness of this
beautiful bride and the groom!
That's a cool torch!
With three big batteries,
you can see anything with this.
- Let me see.
- No, you'll break it.
- It's not mine.
-  What's that?
-  What's with the electricity tonight?
-  What the heck are you doing here?
You said you were going to the
bathroom.
I will use the bathroom later.
Where are you two going?
-  We want to go see the ghosts.
-  What is it?
-  You shouldn't have told him.
-  Ghosts?
-  Shall I?
-  Please!
-  Who turned on the light there?
-  Maybe they've forgotten to turn it off.
No.
Maybe the ghosts turned it on.
Shush!
Did you hear that?
I heard something.
What was it?
Maybe we should come back some other night.
Take away the light from us and let's
see what's going on there.
No.
I don't want to make the ghosts mad.
Run!
I told him not to go with us.
It was his fault.
-  Drink this and you'll be fine.
-  Leave him alone.
Go.
He doesn't need that.
I'll take care of him.
But I brought you the test results.
True.
Well, I still feel the same.
I'm nauseous and...
The day after tomorrow.
Why? Why is it canceled, Doctor?
Right!
Oh! Chemotherapy...
No, I'm not worried.
Let's keep it between ourselves, Doctor!
My wife nurses the babies and I don't
want her to...
Hello?
Are you frightened?
Of course you are.
It is frightening.
We didn't even have a gate here before.
It looked like a jungle out there.
You could find anything there.
Lions, bears, wolves...
I used to take my dad's gun with me
whenever I needed to use the bathroom.
My dad was a gunner.
I went to the bathroom once...
...when I heard something
from the back of the yard.
A pair of leopard eyes was staring at
me through the hole...
...in the bathroom door.
I was frightened to death!
I was lucky I was already
in the bathroom.
Or I could wet my pants!
You should drink this.
It's good for you.
Can you take the sugar-cube like me?
Look!
Put it here.
Hit the palm of your hand with your
other hand...
...and the sugar-cube will bounce!
You'll learn by practicing.
-  What happened next?
-  What?
- The leopard...
- Oh! It wasn't a leopard.
It was a cat.
It had a piece of bone stuck in his throat
and that's why he was roaring.
When you are scared, even you see
a cat as a leopard.
Look what you did.
Ali was frightened to death.
- What's this for?
- It's good for the burn.
- It's alright.
- No, it isn't.
You ruined the ceremony.
Everyone thought it was poor
Ghorban-Ali. It's done.
Turn it on now.
- I should connect the fuse.
- Hajj Naser is here.
Thanks for the toothpaste.
The burn wasn't that bad.
It wasn't my fault.
The pickax hit the wire.
Why are you so upset?
You shouldn't get the
wrong idea, Hajj Naser!
I swear I haven't drunk since
I made a promise to you.
- Not at all.
-  Come in, Hajji!
Join us in the fun.
Why are you sitting out there?
He's not serious.
Don't you believe him!
See?
Why did you dig a hole there?
Oh! Let me tell you that.
I found the map.
We'll all be rich.
I swear my shovel hit something.
Hajj Naser!
You shouldn't joke, Hormoz.
He believed it.
-  Don't mess with him.
-  Is this you, aunt Masoum?
- Look at your hair!
- Oh! That's in college.
Yeah, that's where
you got rid of your accent!
- Look at auntie!
- Such a hottie!
- What do you mean hottie?!
- I mean graceful and nice!
Doesn't anyone want
to get some sleep?
She's getting married tomorrow.
She shouldn't be giving auntie a bath!
She wanted to do it.
Yeah, auntie doesn't let anyone but
Pasand wash her.
-  Where did you find those pictures?
-  In aunt Pasand's album.
-  I haven't seen those.
-  Is this aunt Pasand?!
Look at her!
She looks like Samira a lot.
- Who is this guy?
- It's Ghasem.
-  Her cousin?
-  No, he is auntie's nephew.
They raised him after he lost his
parents.
-  Shush!
-  Why didn't you dye my hair?
I will. I'll do it right away.
I told mom about it when Ghasem
came here to get ready...
...for the university entrance exam.
I told her that she shouldn't let him
come here...
...if he doesn't want to let Pasand
marry him.
That's what our uncle wanted.
He wanted for Pasand and Ghasem to
get married.
It's not his decision.
Ghasem didn't even propose.
He just comes here anytime he has
a leave and he never says anything.
- What are they doing?
-  Let me see.
-  Marzi!
-  She is pregnant, for God's sake!
Come here, auntie.
The wedding we're holding is very
much different from theirs.
What if they hold the same party for
men and women?
- No, Hajj Naser wouldn't allow that.
- Azam!
This could break.
[Singing]
Is the game still on?
Even if you find the treasure, you
should make sure if it's lawful or not.
Isn't it true, Hajji?
- Did you hear him, Naser?
- It's lawful for you.
You don't have to give away anything.
I won't forget to give you your share.
Hajjis get as much as they could
from people!
- All these troubles are because of you.
- What have I done?
Suppose that you find the books.
What the heck are you
going to do with them?
- I'll use the money to get a second wife.
- That's because you are an idiot.
I don't care.
You shouldn't make
the same mistake twice.
Are you happy with your marriages?
Are you?
Of course you aren't.
- It's Reza.
- Come in.
Come in.
Why are you standing there?
Do you want to watch the game with us?
- Come on.
- Like you.
-  What do you wish for?
-  Well, cows had no benefit for me.
Maybe I'll start a turkey business!
Maybe that will be beneficial.
You are all about animals!
What about you, Jafar?
I won't let you watch.
- I don't want to watch.
- Please!
Just answer me.
- Come on! Tell us!
- Well, you know?
These days, there are a lot of
construction workers out there.
A lot of competition...
There is this shop, that..
- I shouldn't have even talked to them.
- Spain has a good team.
They're gonna score.
Bravo!
Smart boy!
Give me five!
-  That was a foul!
-  Not a good game.
- They are losers, even if they win.
- How are you, man?
Having wisher isn't a sin, is it?
That hole you dug,
reminds me of a grave.
- A grave?!
- This sucks!
Hajji!
Where are you going?
-  We were talking here.
-  I'm allergic to too much talking.
I'm going to the roof.
There is not as warm as here.
Of course.
He has no worries, as he's sure
he'll be sent to Heaven.
We need to practice taking the heat,
as we could use it in Hell.
Stop it.
Hajj Naser isn't that well tonight.
-  He's never well.
-  Don't take off my clothes, auntie.
-  Ok.
-  Tell me a story.
You are tired now, honey.
I'll tell you one tomorrow night.
Ok?
-  You promise?
- I do.
The kids must have played with this again.
It wasn't working yesterday, either.
Nothing works in this house.
This place will turn into a ruin soon.
Ghasem is the only one who
fixes things here...
...every now and then that he shows up.
Well, I-- I wanted to say that...
You shouldn't eat that.
I'm heating some bread.
- I'll get it.
- There are like ten men here today.
And no one went to buy some fresh bread.
Kitty!
I'm still here.
And I'm not gonna go anywhere
in five or six months.
It's ok.
I'll be gone for a few days only.
Uncle Ezzat.
Uncle Ezzat!
Mom!
Mom!
-  What?
-  It's Uncle Ezzat.
What's the time?
What about your uncle?
- Oh God!
- Wake up!
Is he breathing?
Ezzat!
Ezzat!
- Give him his pill.
-  Uncle Ezzat!
-  Must be a cardiac arrest.
- Ezzat!
Brother!
-  Leave him alone.
-  Give him CPR.
- I don't know how.
- Masoud knows.
- Masoud!
-  Come here.
- Can you hear me, Uncle Ezzat!
- Uncle Ezzat!
- Marzieh knows how to do it.
- He isn't breathing.
He has a pulse.
Don't worry.
- He'll be fine.
- Go get a doctor.
- Do you want me to go with you?
- No.
-  What happened?
-  Just go!
What is it?
Is it Uncle Ezzat?
-  Don't worry.
-  Put a pillow under his head.
- What happened, Jafar?
- I don't know.
-  What's wrong?
-  Don't go there.
- It's nothing.
-  I want to see my uncle.
Uncle Ezzat!
- I can't believe you!
This was the fastest ride
I've ever had.
Sorry.
Let's go.
- I need that bag.
- Ok.
- Here you are
- Let's go.
- Lock it.
- Ok, I will.
- Hello.
- Come in.
Congratulations!
-  Hello.
-  How are you?
Hello.
- How are you, man?
- Is it your heart again?
- His heart beats.
- And he has a pulse.
- Did this happen in sleep?
-  What is it?
-  Will he be alright?
Please stay back.
Unbutton his shirt, please.
- Will he be ok, Doctor?
- I hope so.
- It's been fifteen to twenty minutes.
- God will decide about that.
We gave him CPR.
Marzieh did.
Oh!
Look at these old scars.
Is that a cat?!
Must be a leopard...
Oh!
Let them cry.
Let them cry as much as they want.
Are you his grandson?
No.
He was my mom's uncle.
Your mom's uncle...
May he rest in peace!
[Reciting a poem]
That guy made me hurry.
I forgot to bring my license.
I hope I have the stamp...
Thank God I do.
This is the death certificate.
Here you are.
God bless you, son.
See you.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Auntie!
Where are you going?
-  I'll go wake Ezzat.
-  It's too early.
-  I should make him tea.
-  Not now.
- I'll do it.
-  Let me go.
-  Auntie!
-  God bless you!
Please stay there, auntie.
I'll make tea.
Go hide her hearing aid.
Hello, neighbors.
Hello, neighbors.
[Announcing the death]
My mom says that the smell of the dead
remains in the house for three days.
Go! Go!
Go away! What are you doing?
May late Ezzatollah Rasoulian
rest in peace!
Peace be upon Prophet Muhammad!
That's enough.
- Don't be upset.
- Eat your drug, you'll have headache.
- You go inside.
- Where were you?
You just went to get a coffin.
What took you so long?
- The cemetery is very close.
- Of course not.
- I had to go to the new cemetery.
- Ok.
This one looks better
and is more decent.
Here you are.
Here are the black shirts.
Give one to Jafar.
-  Someone needs to go to the cemetery.
- I can't go.
I have to take care of Mahnaz.
- Have some sweet water, Mahnaz.
-  Give me my black chador.
- I want to go.
-  Where do you want to go?
You can't go.
Pasand!
What's his cousin's number?
- 6-6-2-4-4-2-0.
Where do you want to go?
You can't go to the funeral.
Azam!
Azam!
Ok.
Ok, bye.
You can't wear black clothes today.
Uncle Ezzat doesn't want you to be
unhappy either.
Why can't I wear black?
The black scarf
you are wearing is enough.
Come here, Hamid.
Mahnaz isn't well.
What happened?
What happened?
Get up!
Get up!
- Let me wear that black dress.
-  Come on.
Come on.
[Reading Quran]
Hajj Naser!
Hajji!
-  Hajj Naser!
-  I'm coming.
[Children singing a song]
- Louder, guys.
-  Lie down.
You can't go anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere, either.
I'll be right here.
Louder, kids!
Don't worry.
You can go.
Wish I could go too.
What would people think?
Go get some pots from the
stock-house.
Why are you back?
They said I should help
Javaher make dinner.
You'd better go if you mean to work
with your laptop instead of helping.
No, I will help.
Late uncle Ezzat used to blame people
for doing things at the wrong time.
He had reproached me for that a lot.
Now he took his revenge on Vaziri by
dying at the wrong time!
God knows why this happened.
We are having a funeral instead of a
wedding  now.
What?
Nothing.
- What do you want?
- I want to get the pots.
I'll get them.
Go help Javaher.
Just go!
[Singing]
[Singing]
Ouch!
Damn it!
-  We were playing, mom!
-  You should get something to eat.
- Sit down.
- I am surprised all those people...
...showed up at his funeral
in this hot weather.
- I'm not hungry.
- Would you like something else?
I'm just not hungry.
That red bus-- it was coming
from Ardakan.
When did they hear of it?!
A lot of people came here to go
to the cemetery with us.
-  The Vaziris were astonished.
- We were astonished too.
- Is Uncle Ezzat dead?
-  You shouldn't underestimate him.
Javaher said he used to bring enough
meat for the whole Shams-Abad...
...whenever he would come back
from hunting.
- Isn't it true, Hormoz?
- Don't sit on the floor.
- You can catch a cold.
-  It's very warm in here.
Poor he!
He was always worried about us.
- I want some water, mom.
- Me too.
Could you please give me two glasses?
-  May he rest in peace!
-  Where is Hajj Naser?
He said he'd stay at the cemetery to
pray for the deceased's soul.
Maybe we should get some meat.
Don't get back home from the
cemetery soon, when I die.
Stay by my grave for a few hours.
Feel free to die, Hormoz!
Because I am planning to set a tent and
stay by your grave for a week.
- Ok?
-  Ok.
But I wish someone else had made
that promise.
Someone who would still be alive when I die,
as I do not intend to die before you!
Shush!
-  You know what, Mahnaz?
-  What?
You must be ashamed of yourself.
We are mourning here.
Vaziri's oldest son was talking to Jafar
about the wedding at the cemetery.
- Bring some food for your auntie, Azam.
- Sure.
-  You didn't eat anything, mother.
-  She hasn't eaten since morning.
What do I tell them?
Their return tickets are due to the day
after tomorrow.
They can cancel the tickets and get
new ones.
It's not about the tickets.
It's the embassy.
They have made an appointment.
If they don't go now, it will be delayed
for a couple of months.
-  What's that pretty guy called?
- Shahrokh.
- Oh! The polite one.
-  He's lost his hair.
Really?
He said he knew someone
at the registry office.
He suggested that they make it official
tomorrow, without telling anyone.
-  Without telling anyone!
- What?!
Without telling anyone?!
Great!
That's true they are rich and we aren't.
But they can't treat us like that.
- Why are you mad at me?!
-  I'm not.
What do you want?
-  Someone needs to talk to Pasand.
-  Pasand?!
Someone needs to talk to
Pasand's mother!
Shush!
She could hear you, Mahnaz.
Well, that's true.
Pasand listens to everything mom says.
By the way...
Did you notice your mother
at the cemetery?
She didn't cry at all.
She isn't well.
She didn't cry at all.
She isn't well.
Of course she isn't.
This isn't at all what she expected.
Jafar!
Azam!
Ghasem is here.
What do we tell him?
Grandma!
Ghasem is here.
Hello.
May he rest in peace!
- Come in.
-  Welcome.
- Hi, mother.
- Hi, son.
Come on. Come on in.
You are too late, anyway!
He went to the cemetery after you left.
He wanted to leave from there.
Naser saw him and brought him home.
Poor he!
He probably didn't feel comfortable.
He is heart broken.
Give me the tray.
Give it to me.
I'll take it.
Let me.
I'll take it.
- Go.
- Shall I?
- I tripped.
- It's ok.
I'll clean up.
We have more food.
No worries.
We have more.
- Hi, Ghasem.
- Hi.
- Sorry for your loss.
- Sorry for your loss.
- How is auntie?
- She doesn't know.
They have hidden her hearing aid.
The food will get cold.
Hajji!
You still have one other prayer to say.
I'll do it later.
Pasandideh!
What happened?
He was sitting here.
He was nagging about his
radio that wasn't working.
I brought him breakfast.
I went to get some bread.
When I came back, I found him...
I don't know what happened.
Mom!
Mom!
Not enough.
These aren't enough.
I need to get some Qurans
from the mosque.
Where are my glasses?
You are wearing them, mom.
And I was looking for them!
Put the dishes away.
Marzieh!
Put the dates in the tray.
-  Hello.
-  Hello.
- Please accept my condolences.
- Sorry for your loss.
-  Thank you.
- Hi, Hajji!
- How are you?
Please accept my condolences.
-  May he rest in peace!
- God bless his soul!
-  Thank you.
-  Hello, Hajji.
-  Hello.
-  Sorry for your loss.
-  It's one hundred thirty five.
-  One hundred and thirty five.
-  Sit down.
-  We need some more in that room.
-  Give me ten more.
-  Masoud!
- Tell the kids not to eat now.
-  Please help yourselves.
Please sit.
Anything else you need?
Peace be upon Prophet Muhammad!
Hi, auntie.
Hi, auntie.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me, auntie?
-  What is it?
- I am Ghasem, auntie.
- Ghasem.
- I can't hear you.
-  Well, that...
-  It was disconnected.
- I fixed it.
- The wire...
This is the problem. I don't
think it's anything else.
Let me...
That's where it should be.
Auntie!
This is Ghasem.
Late Seyyed Reza's son.
Your nephew.
Where were you?
- Right here.
- Not here. He came today.
He's on a leave again.
True.
But this is the last time.
Next time I come home, I'll stay with you.
Pasand!
Come here, Pasand.
Mrs. Vaziri is leaving.
Can you make us a house?
Remember the last time we
made one together?
It fell apart!
Please make us another one.
-  Are you Fereshteh?
- No, I am Samira.
- Wow!
- Bravo!
- Thanks a lot.
This is one beautiful house!
Thank you very much.
-  Please give me my food.
-  Could we have a door too?
Wait!
Let me see what I can find.
-  Take this, Samira.
-  The child is outside.
The child is outside.
Why did you let her go?
She's all dirty!
Mom!
You don't have to do anything.
We'll take care of everything.
We want to set the table
for the children to eat.
-  Aren't you coming?
- I don't understand.
You are a clergyman, so you probably
know how to sing an elegy.
- Sing something.
- Leave me alone!
My voice is husky.
I can't sing.
Just sing something short,
so that she'll cry.
It's nothing serious.
If I sing, I might burst into tears,
which isn't professional.
I can sing.
Shall I?
Forget it, Hamid!
This is no joke.
She will die out of grief if
she doesn't cry tonight.
-  Do you understand?
-  Of course I do.
I really can sing.
Why don't you believe me?
He is telling the truth.
He doesn't have a bad voice.
Come here, Hamid.
Masoud!
- Haven't you seen Ghasem?
- He left.
-  He said bye to Uncle Jafar and he left.
-  He left?
Where did he go?
He said his leave was over and that he
had to be at the base in the morning.
He said he wouldn't find a taxi if he
waits any longer.
- Did he leave a long time ago?
- No, he just left.
- I can go after him, if you want.
-  What? No...
[Singing an elegy]
-  She's finally crying.
-  Thank God.
-  He sings well.
-  He does.
- Thank God the food was enough.
-  It was.
May he rest in peace!
- I am thirsty, mom.
-  Have some coke.
-  I'm thirsty, mom.
-  Just drink it.
- I want water, not coke.
- Didn't you bring water, Shamsi?
-  No, I forgot.
-  Pasand!
- Sit down.
- Water...
Sit.
Whoever wants water, can go get it.
We've been here for two days and
you've been working all the time.
Who knows where we're gonna be
tomorrow.
Here.
Have some.
-  Shall I get your phone, auntie?
-  No need.
Sit.
Well...
What should we tell them?
I don't know.
We'll wait...
And we'll give them an answer when
forty days passes Uncle Ezzat's death.
That's for the best.
It was a great funeral.
- All the neighbors showed up.
- Ali!
- Don't make a mess here.
-  You want some water?
No.
How I love you!
