- I'll get you a new one.
Can we please do something? I'm so bored.
I don't know how you can
just lie in the sun all day.
No, I'm gonna go back to the room.
I told Stuart I'd give him a call.
(CHUCKLES)
Bring me a drink back. Thank you.
Yeah, you wish.
Nice ass.
(LAUGHS)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
I want to make a toast.
Come on!
Thank you so much
for bringing me on vacation.
It's gonna be the best time ever.

What are you talking about?
I lied about why Stuart isn't on this trip.
- What?
- He's not working.
What do you mean?
He left me, Kate.
He broke up with me.
(SOFTLY): Oh, my God.
Why didn't you tell me?
'Cause I was embarrassed.
Do Mom and Dad know?
(SMACKS LIPS, SIGHS)
The one good thing in my life,
I managed to fuck up.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
What happened?
It's my fault.
He got bored.
He actually said that?
Yeah. (LAUGHS)
Kind of, more or less.
And then I thought if I came on
this trip and I came away with you,
and I had fun and I showed
that I could be fun,
somehow he would come back, but...
(DEEP BREATH)
(CRYING)
Come on.
- What?
- Come on, we have to get dressed.
- For what?
- You and I are going out.
Going out where? It's 1:00 in the morning.
(LAUGHS) Lisa, it's Mexico. You and I are
the only ones who aren't out. Come on.
I've been dying to do this all week.

25-foot great white sharks.
They come right up to your cage.

- You have never seen anything like it.
- KATE: How much does it cost?
- (MEN SPEAKING SPANISH)
What?
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
Bueno. It's like $100 each.
We-we know Taylor.
He's like a friend of ours.
Great.
Uh, mmm... I don't know.
What are you gonna do...
sit by the pool all day long?
(LAUGHS)
- Seriously?
- I-I don't even know how to dive.
I will teach you everything
you need to know.
But I need one of those, like,
diving card certification.
You took that whole class!
Okay, okay, look, look.
This is Méjico, okay?
It's not even diving.
You're gonna be in a cage.
You're only down five minutes.
- It's totally safe.
- LOUIS: Exactly.
It's like you're going to the
zoo, except you're in the cage.
- Yeah, and-and underwater.
- Sí.
Come on, it sounds amazing.
Please?
I don't know.
You could just think of the photos.
I mean, they won't be the type of

we're gonna go talk to the captain.

Oye, Captain!
I... really, I feel
super uneasy about this.
Come on, it'll be fine.
I mean, is this even safe?
We don't know anything about these people.
Remember what the concierge said?
That we should book
all activities and tours...
Yeah, he works for the hotel.
He has to say that.
I've just heard horror stories about
tourists going on these shady trips.
And Stuart even told me that...
Stuart is a prick, Lisa.
It'll be fun. Come on.

So-so maybe we're just a bit too deep.
Maybe... maybe if I swim up a tiny bit,
then-then we'll be back in range, okay?
I could tell them that we're alive,
and they need to come and get us.
Yeah, but what about the sharks?
They can sense us down here, right?
I'll swim as close to the cage as I can.
I'll be okay.

Um, the gauge is at 47 meters.
I had to come up to hear you...
I'm at 40 meters.
I'm am so freaking scared. What do I do?
TAYLOR: All right, listen, Kate.
I need you to get
back in the cage immediately.
It's the only safe place from the sharks.
Do you understand?
Javier's coming down to you now.
He's going to hook up the cage
to our spare winch
- and pull you up.
- Okay.
And remember, Kate,
whatever you and Lisa do,
don't try to race to the surface.
You'll get the bends.
I'm going back down now.
Promise me you'll come.

and reserve your air.
Okay.

Just keep breathing.
I made contact with them, Lisa.
(BREATHLESSLY): I made contact.
LISA: Yeah? Yeah?
What did the say?
Javier is coming down.
He's gonna connect the cage
- to a backup winch.
- He is?
Oh! Thank God, thank God, thank God.
Oh, okay. Oh, thank God.
- We need to conserve our air.
- Okay. Okay.
Oh, it's almost over.
I was so frightened, Kate,
waiting for you.
I thought that you were never coming back.
I'm so sorry I got us into this.
The other night at the hotel,
what did you mean when you said
that your relationship
was the only thing you were good at?
You're always doing such fun stuff, Kate.
Traveling around the world
doing crazy things,
guys always chasing after you.
I could never compete with that.
I was always just
your boring older sister, but...
my relationship with Stuart
was the one thing I had that you didn't.
We were never in competition.
Maybe you weren't.
What do you think Stuart would
say if he could see you now?
(LAUGHS)
(BOTH LAUGH)
What?
He would lose his mind.
- (LAUGHING)
- Yeah.
Listen.
(RUMBLING IN DISTANCE)
What is that?
Oh, my God, that's the boat's engine.
Oh, my God, they've left us!
They-they wouldn't have left us, okay?
- Oh, God.
- Maybe it's something else.
- Maybe it was a different boat.
- We would've heard it arrive.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?
I've got to go and try
and get them on the radio again.
Kate, what are we gonna do
if they're not there?
KATE: They will not have left us, okay?
Taylor, can you hear me?
Hello, are you there?
Please answer me, someone!
Taylor, it's Kate. Can you hear me?
Hello, is anyone there?
Please, someone answer me!
(SCREAMS)
Lisa, open the hatch!
Open the hatch! It was a shark!
(SCREAMS)
I can't open it! It's caught on the chain!
It's coming! Oh, my God!
Hurry, hurry!
KATE (SHUDDERING): Oh, my God.
I thought it was g...
I thought it was gonna get me.
I thought it... I was dead.
(BOTH SHRIEKING)
The cage is gonna break!
It's gonna get through!
(BARS CREAKING)
KATE: Be quiet! Quiet, be quiet.
LISA: It almost broke through the cage.
We're not safe here anymore.
Did you make contact with Taylor?
They weren't there.
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.
They're not just gonna leave us here.
They said they were sending someone down.
But we heard them leave, didn't we?
They also said they were gonna
come down here
and attach, like, a spare winch
to the top of the cage,
but did you even see one
on the boat? I didn't...
They are not gonna
leave us to die down here, okay?
- You need to calm down.
- So we have to get back up to the top.
No, Lisa, listen to me,
we cannot just swim up.
- We can swim fast.
- No, we can't.
- We can!
- We will get the bends.
Do you know what the bends is?
It's nitrogen bubbles in the brain.
The only way to go up is to ascend slowly
with a decompression stop
for five minutes.
Unprotected, in open water.
(WHIMPERING)
I'm so scared we're gonna die down here.
- I don't want to die down here, Kate.
- We are not gonna die.
We're not gonna die down here.
It's okay, they're gonna come and get us.
Read me your air.
Um... um...
it says 80 bar.
I don't know what that means.
At this depth, that means
we have about 20 minutes, tops,
before you run out.
What about you?
Kate.
30 bar.
LISA: Oh, my God.
KATE: I'm gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.
LISA: You're gonna run out of air.
(RADIO CRACKLES)
Listen.
Javier?
(PANTING): What is that?
I-Is that Javier?
LISA: There! There!
There, there, there! Hey! Hey!
Can you hear us?
We can see your flashlight.
(LAUGHS)
Javier!
Hey!
KATE: Why isn't he coming towards us?
LISA: May-Maybe he's out of range.
Hey! Javier!
KATE: We need to make sure
he knows where we are.
(CLANGING)
LISA: What's he doing?
KATE: I don't know.
LISA: Well, if he heard us,
why didn't he just signal?
We need to get that winch cable.
(BEEPING)
LISA: 17 bar. You're almost out of air.
Okay...
Okay, I'm gonna go out there and find him.
You just need to tell me
exactly what I need to do.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Okay.
Keep as close to
the ocean floor as you can.
Sharks attack from below, so if you
keep to the floor, you should be fine.
This button inflates your BCD.
Use it to go up.
This button deflates it.
Listen to me, this is so important.
No matter what happens,
no matter how panicked you get,
do not go straight up.
You will die. Do you understand?
I'll be right back.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Get down on the floor
as quick as you can, okay?
That's good. You're doing so good. Okay.
Keep your breathing slow.
Just focus on the flashlight.
Lisa, I can see the shark!
It's coming towards you!
Hide! Hide!
(SHRIEKS)
(PANTING)
KATE: Lisa? Lisa, can you hear me?
Are you safe?
- Lisa?
- I'm okay.
I'm okay. I'm in a cave.
The shark almost got me.
KATE: Where is it now?
I think it's gone.
(SCREAMING)
KATE: Lisa? What's going on?
Lisa, are you okay?
Lisa? Answer me, please.
I'm okay.
(BEEPING)
I'm getting low on air.
I can see the flashlight.
I can see the beam. It's getting closer...
Oh! Oh, my God. Oh.
KATE: Lisa, what's wrong? What's wrong?
I'm at the edge of some sort of cliff.
I can't see the ocean floor.
KATE: We're running out of time.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Okay, I can do this. I can do this.
(RADIO STATIC)
KATE: Are you doing okay, Lisa?
I am so scared, Kate.
I can't even see what's below me.
(SIGHS)
(GROANS)
(SIGHS)
I see it! I see it!
I see it!
I found the flashlight.
(GROANS) Javier?
(PANTING AND GROANING)
He's not here, Kate. Javier?
I'm gonna come back, okay?
(PANTING)
Which way did I come from?
Oh. Oh.
Kate? Oh.
Uh-oh. Um...
Kate, can you hear me? Hello?
Kate? Kate, please answer me.
I'm really lost,
and I'm freaking out right now.
(PANTING AND GASPING)
Oh, my God.
(GROANING)
Stay calm. Stay calm and make a decision.
Kate!

I need you to bang a rock or something
when you see the flashlight,
so I know which way to go.
- (BANGING NEARBY)
- (GASPS)
I can hear you, Kate!
(SCREAMS)
(GARBLED RADIO TRANSMISSION)
(WHIMPERING)
He's got no air. Damn.
Okay, I have to...
I have to get the winch.
I have to get the winch.
(PANTING)
Oh. Spear gun.
Oh, God.
(PANTING)
KATE: I can see the flashlight.
You're getting closer.
LISA: Oh. Okay. I can see the
lights on the cage. I'm coming.
I'm coming, Kate.
Lisa, I thought you were dead.
Where's Javier?
The shark ripped him to pieces.
I have the winch cable.
Oh, I was so lost I thought
I would never see you again.
Thread it through this end.
Hey, the cable looks really thin.
Do you think it will hold?
It has to. Give me the flashlight.
I'm gonna swim back up, and tell them
- that we have to come up now.
- Be careful!
I'll be right back.
(PANTING)
(PANTING)
Taylor?
Taylor, can you hear me?
(PANTING)
Taylor, hello!
- TAYLOR: Kate?
- LISA: It's Lisa.
We managed to attach the cable
to the top of the cage.
We need to come up right now!
- TAYLOR: Is Javier with you?
- No!
- Javier is dead.
- What? Oh... Jesus.
Get back in the cage!
Get back in the cage now!
I'm bringing you back up!
They're bringing us up now.
- They are?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Oh. Thank God.
(PANTING)
(CREAKING)
Kate, do you hear that?
(WHIRRING)
(LAUGHING): Do you hear that?
Oh. Oh.
(LAUGHTER)
- Oh. See?
- Yeah.
Look. We're starting to move.
(CREAKING AND WHIRRING)
We're gonna go home!
Oh. Oh, thank God it's almost over!
Oh, we're gonna go home!
(PANTING)
It's working. Look. We're getting higher.
You did it, Lisa. You saved us.
The gauge is starting to move. Look, Kate.
Kate, it's at 46 meters.
45. (PANTING)
44.
We're gonna get out of here.
Yeah.
TAYLOR: Kate, Lisa, can you hear me?
Taylor, we can hear you.
We're at 36 meters.
35!
34!
33.
BOTH: 32!
(LAUGHING)
BOTH: 31!
TAYLOR: Good. Good. We're almost there.
BOTH: 30!
TAYLOR: Nice and slowly.
BOTH: 29!
- 28...
- (THUDDING)
- Taylor!
- Taylor, cable's breaking!
- TAYLOR: What?
- LISA: Taylor, help us!
TAYLOR: All right, listen, stay calm.
- Don't move! I'm gonna slow it down.
- (WHIMPERING)
Taylor, help.
Taylor? Taylor?
(SNAPPING)
(BOTH SCREAMING)
(SCREAMING)
(CRYING)
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off, Kate!
Oh, my God! Okay.
(SCREAMS)
It's stuck, I can't move it!
(LISA MOANS)
(GASPING)
(BEEPING)
We're running out of time!
I've got to get ahold of Taylor.
Don't leave me, Kate.
I don't want to suffocate.
KATE (PANTING): No, it's going to be fine.
I'm going to come back.
Taylor, it's Kate.
- TAYLOR: Are you hurt?
- Lisa's trapped.
Her leg is stuck and we have no air!
My gauge is on five bar.
It's gonna run out any minute.
TAYLOR: I'm going to send down
extra air tanks.
But, Kate, there's a reason
that I didn't do this before.
Moving onto a second tank
is going to increase
your chance of nitrogen narcosis
dramatically.
You're going to need to watch
each other closely to make sure
that neither of you is behaving
strangely or hallucinating.
I've notified the Coast Guard.
They're sending a team that's fully
equipped for deep sea rescue.
They'll be here in less than an hour.
LISA: I'm so scared.
KATE: It's gonna be fine.
(BURBLING)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(INTERMITTENT BEEPING)
Look. (PANTING)

It's the oxygen tanks.

I'll be right back.
(BEEPING)
Shit.
I'm almost out of air.

(GRUNTS)
LISA: Kate, did you find it?
(HISSING, KATE SIGHS)
Kate, are you okay?
KATE (GASPING): Yeah.
Okay.
They sent down some flares.
All we have to do is wait for
the Coast Guard to arrive.
I've got the spare tank.
Kate, get down.
Stay down.
Where is it, Lisa?
It's right above you, don't move.
(GASPING): Oh, God, I can't see it!
(CRYING)
I'm going to make a break for the cage.
No, Kate, no, no, no, don't move.
Stay down, please, stay down.
Open the hatch.
(LISA SCREAMS)
(SCREAMING): No, no, Kate!
(CRYING AND GASPING): No, no, no, Kate.
(CRYING): No.

I thought that you were dead.
Oh, God.
I managed to escape.
(PANTING): Sharks, are circling me.
I'm hurt.
- How bad, how bad?
- Bad.
I'm bleeding a lot.
It's... it's attracting more sharks.
How much air do you have left?
30 bar.
The shark punctured my BCD.
My oxygen's escaping.
(CRYING): I'm scared, Lisa.
I know, I know.
Okay, I need you to listen to me.
You need to remain calm.
They are going to come down and get us.
I need you to concentrate
on your breathing, okay?
Breathe in and out,
like you told me, okay?
In and out.
- (SIGHS)
- In and out.
KATE: So cold.
Right, I'm gonna come and get you.
I'm gonna come and find you right now.
KATE: Tired...

Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Stay with me, Kate.
Stay with me, okay?
Just keep talking to me.
KATE: I'm not going to make it.

Kate, can you see the beam

KATE (WEAKLY): Lisa... Lisa...
I'm so cold.
Kate, keep talking to me, please.
Can you see the beam from my flashlight?
KATE: I see you, I see the flashlight.
Yes! Yes, I can hear you!
Okay, I'm coming to find you.
Stay right where you are.
Kate?
Kate, can you see my flashlight?
KATE: Over here.
Kate!
Oh, God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
(PANTING)
Kate, you're bleeding to death.
Kate, we have to go up now.
I'm not gonna let you die.
Come on, we can do it.
- (SCREAMS)
- Come on.
(KATE GROANING)
Use the flare, Kate.
It'll help ward off the sharks.
Taylor?
Taylor, can you hear me?
(KATE GROANING)
Taylor?
Taylor, can you hear us?
Taylor!
TAYLOR: Hello?
- Can you hear me? Lisa?
- Taylor, can you hear us?
TAYLOR: Lisa, I can hear you.
Oh! Okay, um... we are heading up now.
TAYLOR: No, it's not safe.
You need to stay in the cage.
LISA: We don't have a choice.
Kate has been badly hurt.
We are coming up now.
TAYLOR: All right, but you
need to go very slowly.
Do you understand?
If you ascend too quickly,
you're going to get the bends.
LISA: Okay.
(KATE GROANING)
TAYLOR: Look at your gauge.
Tell me what your depth is.
LISA: Um, we're at 30 meters.
TAYLOR: You need to slow down.
If you get nitrogen bubbles in your brain,
you are dead, do you understand?
Yes, I understand!
We are coming.
(KATE GROANING)
We're getting there, Kate.
We're getting there.
Come on, you just need
to hang on a little bit longer.
(KATE PANTING)
(LISA GRUNTING)
LISA: We're at 20 meters.
TAYLOR: Okay, good.
Now you need to stay there for five
minutes and do a decompression stop.
LISA: Okay. Okay.
TAYLOR: You need to let
the nitrogen leave your bloodstream.
Four and a half minutes.
LISA: We need to light another one, hurry!
KATE: Okay.
I have two more.
(KATE GROANS)
I dropped it.
LISA: Here, take the flashlight.
Where is it? Where is it?
I can't find it, Kate.
Oh, got it!
Got it!
TAYLOR: Just three more minutes.
(LISA SCREAMING)
Taylor, there are sharks everywhere!
And we're on our last flare.
(LISA SCREAMS)
We're gonna make it, Kate.
We're gonna make it,
just stay with me, okay?
(LISA SCREAMS)
We're out of flares!
What do we do?

Drop your BCD and swim!
Swim!
