[radio stations tuning]
[woman] Some people called it the
greatest love story of the 20th century.
The king who gave up his throne
for the woman he loved.
Wallis Simpson, as she was known,
was not distinguished
by great beauty, money or class.
- [telephone rings]
- But 40 years later she would
spark a constitutional crisis,
when the King of England,
Edward VIII, decided to abdicate,
in order to marry this
twice-divorced American woman.
Exiled and stripped of a kingdom,
they become
the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
[telephone continues ringing]
Their romantic legend lives on today.
[stations tuning]
[answering machine clicks on]
[man] Hey, Wally, it's me.
l'm still in DC.
l'm not gonna make it back tonight.
l haven't even made my speech yet.
Gotta run.
l'll see you tomorrow.
Love you.
[woman on radio]
Wallis had been married twice,
before her romance with the Prince.
Her first husband,
Navy Lieutenant Earl Winfield Spencer,
swept Wallis off to the exotic world
of Shanghai in 1 924.
The marriage ended in divorce
three years later.
[man] Wallis?!
Wallis?! Where the fuck are you?
l'm in the bath!
[man] Where's my dinner?
l'm hungry!
[cries out]
[grunts]
Don't you tell me to wait!
l want my food now.
l waited six hours for you.
[groaning]
- Win, not the baby!
- [grunts]
[groans, sobs]
l'm hungry.
[continues sobbing]
[woman] This is a very
unusual situation, Wally.
[Wally] Well, what are my options?
[woman] You're only 28.
One of your options would be
to relax and keep trying.
[Wally] We've been married six years.
We've never used birth control.
l'd like to start lVF.
[woman] What about your husband?
Would he be willing to come in?
- There could be something...
- No. He wouldn't.
He says he got his girlfriend
pregnant in college.
[woman] Still, lVF is a very aggressive
approach for a woman of your age.
Perhaps l could refer you
to a nutritionist?
Or maybe you and your husband
could go away on a vacation?
My husband doesn't take vacations.
[tapping on wine glass]
[woman 2] Excuse me, everyone,
l would like to make a toast.
l know you heard it earlier
at the awards ceremony,
but l would like to personally
thank you, William,
for all of your hard work
on behalf of terminally ill children
and for your tireless effort
and support for our foundation.
You could easily
make a fortune as a shrink,
treating the problems
of the rich and shameless.
[woman 3] What's wrong
with the rich and shameless?!
[woman 2] Absolutely nothing, Daphne,
as long as you keep writing the checks.
To our very own Prince of Wales,
Dr. William Winthrop.
[all] To William!
Your husband, what can l say?
Generous, smart, and PS, gorgeous!
Lucky you.
Wally.
- Wally.
- Arabella.
How are you?
- You must be so proud of William.
- lt's such an honor.
What's it going to take to get you two
down to the Hamptons this summer?
Edgar's starting to think
you don't like us!
That's not true. l just wish l could
get William to go away for the weekend.
He never wants to leave his patients.
Well, that's why he wins the awards.
- You are such a lucky girl.
- Thank you. l'll see you inside.
[woman on TV] Her name
was Bessie Wallis Warfield.
She was born into a poor,
southern family on June 1 9th, 1 896.
Forty years later, the King of England,
the handsome and dashing Edward Vlll,
fell in love and decided
to marry this American woman.
Tomorrow, Sotheby's begins previewing
their impressive estate.
An estate now owned
by Mohammed Al Fayed,
the colorful and controversial
owner of Harrods in London.
Sotheby's says they will be auctioning
off more than 44,000 pieces of history.
Objects which tell a tale
of luxury and romance.
[faint sirens]
Who's the blonde?
What blonde?
The one you were talking to all night?
[William] l talked to
a lot of people tonight.
Everyone but me.
ls that your new girlfriend?
You're my new girlfriend.
Very funny.
[siren blares]
[men shouting faintly]
[shouting]
[quiet chattering]
[woman] Well, if it isn't Sotheby's
number one research hotshot.
- Tenten!
- Oh, my God.
- l miss having you around!
- l miss being here.
Oh, please! What do you miss
about being overworked and underpaid?
- Everything.
- You look great!
Miss Brooks needs help
with the luggage vignette.
Don't you dare leave
without filling me in.
l want to hear everything,
married lady.
All right.
- [Wallis] Marie?
- [maid speaks French]
[speaking French]
Oui, madame.
[Marie] Oui, madame.
[wine glasses clink]
- l'm sorry. l didn't...
- No.
lt's no problem. We have plenty
of 1 8th century crystal in the back.
l believe it's 1 9th century.
[man clears throat]
[ticking]
[Wally] l went to
the fertility doctor today.
[William] Does she know
what's wrong with you?
[Wally] Yeah, l need to relax.
l want to go through with lVF.
[heartbeats]
[William] lVF?
You can't make these decisions
without consulting me.
[Wally] You're never around.
[William] Jesus Christ...
[Wally] We're talking
about children, William.
[deep breaths]
[William] No...
You're talking about children.
[up-tempo music]
[William] Oh, come on, they were Nazis.
Or at least Nazi sympathizers.
- [Wally] Says who?
- [William] Everyone.
lt's common knowledge.
Thank you.
They went to Germany
in the '30s, met with Hitler.
Because Edward was desperate
to avoid a war.
They might have been naive,
but doesn't make them... Nazis.
- lt's all documented, Wally.
- Well, it's not actually.
- Most of it's based on rumor.
- Let's agree to disagree.
l thought doctors relied
on empirical evidence, not gossip.
This doctor is off duty tonight.
[Wally] Lucky me.
- [William] Speed limit.
- [Wally] Civil War.
- [William] Old news.
- [Wally] Bad luck.
Safe sex.
Unconditional love.
- Tongue twister, or spoonerism?
- l'll definitely have a tongue twister,
because l don't even know
what a spoonerism is.
- You don't know what a spoonerism is?
- l don't, l'm afraid, miss.
- l don't believe that.
- Try this one.
Round and round the rugged rocks
the ragged rascal ran...
- You make it sound so sexy.
- ...in a truly rural way.
- [elevator dings]
- Hm?
- Try that.
- [pager beeps]
Shit. l've got to go
back to the hospital.
- Now?
- Yeah.
l'll be back as soon as l can.
Wait up for me, all right?
- OK.
- Bye.
[dials telephone]
[ringing]
[woman] Hello, New York Presbyterian.
ls Dr. Winthrop there?
- Uh, no. We haven't seen him tonight.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, ma'am. l'm quite sure.
- All right. Thank you.
[rain falling]
[thunder rumbles]
[sneezes]
- [man] Bless you.
- Thank you. This infernal cold!
Look, we don't have to go to this thing.
Are you out of your mind? l've spent
six months ingratiating myself
with Thelma to get us this invitation.
[scoffs] l understand that, Wallis.
But you're not feeling well.
[sneezes] That's not the point.
l'm not letting Thelma down.
You know how hard she works
to make these weekends perfect
for His Royal Highness.
We can't disappoint him.
Disappoint him?
He doesn't even know us.
Which is precisely why
we're going, Ernest darling.
l swear, you are the most
stubborn woman l have ever met.
[Wallis sneezes]
- [Wallis] Excuse us.
- [Ernest laughing]
[Wallis] l'm just trying to be polite.
- Thank you, darling.
- [honks horn]
[Ernest] Oh, there's one left!
You know what l don't understand?
Why Thelma calls the Prince, "David,"
- when his name is really Edward.
- His full name:
Edward Albert Christian George
Andrew Patrick David.
Only his family call him David.
Thelma is not family.
l'm sure she'd like to be.
- [both laughing]
- [Wallis sneezes]
[Ernest] Bless you.
Can you believe we're here?
Ooh!
Darling...
...l'm just happy
to get away with you somewhere.
Ernest, we have to practice.
- Yes... Yes, OK.
- Come here.
- Your Highness.
- [kisses hand]
- Left foot.
- OK.
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.
- Two, two, three.
- Two, two... Ow!
- [Ernest] Sorry.
- [Wallis laughs]
l hope you don't mind
if l dance with the prince.
Darling...
...l'll be upset if you don't.
[chattering]
[low-tempo music]
- David.
- Mm.
Connie, you look lovely.
How are you, darling?
- Connie.
- Goodness me.
Hello.
Your Royal Highness.
How do you find
living in England, Mrs. Simpson?
l love it.
Except for the lack of central heating.
l'm always cold.
Maybe you need someone
to keep you warm.
lsn't that what husbands are for?
l don't know, what are husbands for?
[Wallis] You might have to marry
someone to find out, sir.
And how do you find marriage,
Mrs. Simpson?
Everything's a compromise,
isn't it?
Doesn't sound very romantic.
Ah, romance.
That's another matter altogether,
Your Highness.
Are all Americans girls
such good dancers?
l wouldn't know, sir.
l haven't danced with many.
Excuse me, ma'am, we're closing now.
l'm sorry.
l was just daydreaming.
lt's no problem.
We're still closing.
OK.
l miss this place. lt's so good
to be sitting at a desk again.
- Please put me to work.
- Uh-uh.
l've been here 1 2 hours.
l need a distraction.
l told you before.
l want to hear everything.
[man] Ladies and gentlemen,
the exhibition is now closing.
The exhibition is now closing.
Excuse me, ma'am? Ma'am?
You forgot your umbrella.
Thank you.
l'm Evgeni Kolpakov.
Wally Winthrop.
You were one of
Miss Brooks's girls, hm?
They don't talk much to the help.
- Have a good night.
- You, too.
- Mm-hm.
- Shut up.
[man on lnternet] Wallis had already
left the country,
and had arrived in France.
The ex-king went to Austria,
to begin his exile.
They spent the next five months apart.
She was with friends on the Riviera.
But he sent her dozens of letters,
and telephoned every day.
[man 2] l have never known,
in the course of all knowledge,
one person so utterly
possessed by another...
...as he was by her.
lt was very remarkable.
lt wasn't domination.
lt was a form of possession.
[Wallis] You know, you're quite pretty.
My endowments were definitely
on the scanty side.
Nobody ever called me beautiful,
or even pretty.
l think you were.
l mean, you still are very attractive.
Attractive, my dear,
is a polite way of saying
a woman's made the most
of what she's got.
The only thing l could do was
dress better than anyone else.
lf everyone looked at me
when l entered a room...
...then l knew my husband
would feel proud of me.
Don't you think a woman has more to
offer than the way she's dressed?
Of course. But men are such
visual creatures, darling.
So it's a good place to start.
The most important thing is your face.
The other end, you just sit on.
[William] Am l interrupting something?
No.
Nothing.
- l was just...
- lt doesn't look like nothing to me.
What does it look like to you?
lt looks like you're trying
to be someone you're not.
Where were you tonight?
- l was working.
- And last night?
- You never even came home.
- What is this? An interrogation?
l was working.
- l slept at the hospital.
- l called the hospital.
- They said you weren't there.
- l was in the emergency room.
l'm not having
this conversation again.
l don't have
a nine-to-five job, Wally.
You could have called.
l tried your cell phone.
lt was off.
l was worried!
You were worried?
[scoffs]
[laughs]
ls that why you
got dressed up like a whore?
l don't know, William.
Why don't you tell me?
What does a whore dress like?
[gasps]
[William] l can't compete
with the Duke of Windsor.
- [cameras flashing]
- [people chattering]
[man narrating] lt was
a marvelous reception,
which the King received in South Wales,
on his visit to the long-suffering
communities of that depressed area.
[speaking Welsh]
- Hello, sir.
- Very nice to meet you.
Evening, sir.
Hi, there. God bless you, sir.
[speaking Welsh]
[Edward] Thank you, sir.
- God bless you, sir.
- Sir.
Thank you.
Hello, there.
[speaking Welsh]
Sir, l don't think
that's a good idea.
Thank you for having me
into your home.
[man narrating] They travelled
through the desolate villages
of the Rhondda, Monmouth Valleys.
The whole region was dying
for want of work.
Your Highness,
what is your impression of South Wales?
My impression...
My impression is that this is
a place of decent men and women,
living in indecent conditions!
- And something must be done!
- [crowd cheers]
[man] Thank you!
Thank you, Your Highness.
[man on radio]
"Something must be done."
This natural sentiment
was seized on by some,
- and called "political meddling."
- [cocktail shaking]
[Wallis] But why the outrage
if you're just stating the obvious?
The King is not meant
to have an opinion.
You wanna play deaf, dumb and blind?
- Precisely.
- Well, where l come from
we say what we think
and we mean what we say.
- l like where you come from.
- Baltimore?
[chuckles]
- [stammers] Your Royal Highness!
- Ernest!
l just made his Royal Highness
a martini, would you like one, dear?
That would be lovely, darling.
- [doorbell rings]
- That'll be Connie.
- [Ernest] Excuse me.
- Thelma called,
she said she might
be a little late.
Then you'll just have
to keep me entertained.
l make a mean martini.
Let's start there
and see how it goes.
- Sorry we're late.
- Darling, Connie's here.
- Your Royal Highness.
- Connie. Marvelous to see you.
Hello, Wallis, darling.
l hope you don't mind,
l brought some thirsty friends!
- The more the merrier!
- Lovely to see you. How are you?
Who are you?
[♪ Blind Blake: "Love, Love
Alone Duke and Duchess Remix"]
- [man] Shall we?
- [Connie] Love the frock.
- [man 2] Hello.
- Hello, how are you?
Your Highness.
Let me get you drinks.
Stay right there.
l know what you like.
[all chattering]
Your drinks are becoming legendary,
Mrs. Simpson.
Well, your Royal Highness,
something had to be done
with those awkward hours
between tea and dinner.
Ah, Thelma, there you are, darling!
David.
- You're here already?
- Yes.
What took you so long?
- Hello.
- Hello.
[music continues faintly]
[chatter on security radio]
[woman singing on radio]
[Thelma] l must say Marmaduke's been
such a gentlemen about the divorce.
- [Wallis] One lump or two?
- One.
lt almost makes me have
second thoughts about leaving him.
You know what they say:
never jump into the same river twice.
Anyway, after ten minutes with David,
l soon forgot all about that river.
[both chuckle]
He took me to see Tosca last night.
- Divine.
- Tosca or His Royal Highness?
Both!
- Thelma, can l ask you something?
- Of course.
Do you call him Your Royal Highness?
Well, you know, do you call him
Your Royal Highness...?
No.
l only ever call him David.
Or darling.
l do hate the thought of leaving him
on his own while l'm in America.
- How long will you be gone?
- Three months.
Promise me you'll look after him.
David so adores you and Ernest.
No one can fill your shoes,
but we'll do our best.
Thank you, Wallis.
You're such a good friend.
[man] Ladies and gentlemen,
the exhibition is now closing.
The exhibition is now closing.
Hi.
l can give you another
1 5 minutes while we lock up.
No, thanks, l was just leaving.
OK. Have a good night, Miss Winthrop.
Mrs. Winthrop.
- Mrs. Winthrop. Have a good night.
- You, too.
[man] You don't think, ma'am,
that women have suffered somewhat
over the last 30 years by being
too competitive with men?
They've lost something of their
essential character and charm.
- [woman] No, l don't think so really.
- [William] Wally?
- l don't think they have at all.
- Wally?
- l'll be right out.
- ...use their femininity in business.
Both you and the Duke would have
liked to have had children?
Yes...
l'm a jerk.
[both breathing heavily]
William?
What is it?
ls it me?
No.
l just wish we could have sex
without the constant pressure
- of your need to get pregnant.
- l never said anything about that.
No, but it's always there!
l'm sorry.
Maybe l don't want a kid.
Since when?
l don't know.
Do you want to talk about it?
- Not really.
- William...
You told me you wanted to have children.
That you didn't want me to work.
- l gave up my career.
- lf that's what you want to call it.
Regardless of what you think,
it was work to me, and l enjoyed it.
Calm down.
[door slams]
[piano plays soft music]
[plays lively notes]
Are you...
...finished?
Sir, you don't believe all this nonsense
about Thelma and the Aly Khan.
She's devoted to you.
Devoted to me, to her husband
and now to a camel jockey.
She's extended her stay to America
by another month.
Well, then she deserves your pity,
not your jealousy.
Jealousy? Who says l'm jealous?
Well, all men are territorial.
l'm not all men.
But you're a man.
l'm a man who needs a drink.
Tell me about your day.
How did your meeting go
at the House of Commons?
Disastrous. l was accused
of being a socialist.
That's quite a feat. Only last week,
you were accused of being a fascist.
Well, they'll say anything
to undermine me.
Anyway, l'm sure you don't
wish to talk about my work.
Actually, l do. l just finished that
book you suggested on social reform.
l think what you're trying
to do is incredibly important.
One olive or two?
Two.
There we are.
Everybody deserves
a roof over their head.
Now you sound like a socialist.
Well, if the Germans can do it...
...why can't the English?
Wallis, you're the only woman who has
ever shown any interest in my work.
Am l... sir?
Please, call me David.
[door closes]
Your Royal Highness...
...what a surprise.
Really? l've been here
every night this week.
Will you be staying for dinner, sir?
lf you'll have me.
lf you don't mind having chicken.
- Again?
- Again.
- Would you like a drink, dear?
- Yes. Yes, please.
- Oh, Mrs. Winthrop, hello.
- Hi.
Whoa. [nervous laugh]
Sorry, you can't come in here.
- Why not?
- VlP entrance.
You have a pass?
Where do l get one of those?
lt's very complicated.
You have identification?
[Tenten] Wally!
How's that for identification?
Miss Brooks has sent her KGB officer.
[Tenten] So l see
someone has an admirer.
What's his story?
Russian intellectual,
slumming as a security guard.
Dime a dozen.
[up-tempo jazz playing]
- [Ernest] l'm dreading tonight.
- [Wallis] Why?
Lady Cunard can be so tiresome.
She dislikes everybody.
That's not the point.
lt's Thelma's coming home party.
And Thelma's a dear friend.
We have to go.
l suppose you'll be seated
next to Peter Pan.
- Don't call him that.
- Why not?
A man can be envious of a fellow
who doesn't have to grow up.
lt seems like an unfair advantage.
- What are you going on about?
- l hope you don't ignore me all night.
Ernest, darling.
How could l ignore you,
when you look so dashing in your tuxedo?
Not as dashing as the prince.
Now you're just being silly.
- Run along and let me get ready.
- OK.
Go on.
[Ernest] See you in a few minutes.
[no audio]
[all chattering]
How's your meat cooked?
A bit dry?
Here's an idea, we could do the red
and then the green in the same room.
David?
Maybe we could come up
the fort next weekend...
- [glass clinking]
- ...or the weekend after?
l'd like to make a toast
to my dear friend Thelma,
who's been gone far, far too long!
London's been dreary without
you, darling. Welcome home.
- Thank you.
- To Thelma!
- [all] To Thelma!
- Welcome home.
David, you'll never guess
where l visited in Manhattan.
- Where?
- The Empire State Building.
l went all the way to the very top,
1 02 floors. Can you imagine?
The view was breathtaking!
Sounds dangerous.
[woman] You couldn't pay me enough
to go to the top of that building.
Nobody one could
pay you enough, Emerald.
You are married to
the wealthiest man in England.
l thought l was
the wealthiest man in England.
My God, David, look what you've done.
[chatter stops abruptly]
You've torn my dress.
l'm so sorry.
Well...
...it is Schiaparelli.
[door opens, closes]
[Emerald] More wine, anyone?
[chatter resumes]
[Evgeni] l see potential danger
in the jewelry department.
Yep. l'm sure you do.
Just doing my job, Dwayne.
Yep. l'm sure you are.
You've been extremely decent
about all this, old chap.
How can l be anything but?
l love her.
l will always love her.
All I can ask is that
you do the same.
You have my word.
Your Majesty.
l think this belongs to you.
[gasps] Oh.
[Wallis] Are you trying to seduce me?
[Edward] ls it working?
[all singing] ♪ For he's
a jolly good fellow
♪ And so say all of us
- [party horn blows]
- ♪ And so say all of us

lt's not my birthday.
Oh, it's like Fort Knox.

"All for love and the world well
lost. Happy Birthday. W.E."
Thank you, David.
Who's "WE?"
Wallis and Edward, silly.
That's so sweet.
[laughter]
Your tea, madam.
[Wallis] Your Majesty!
You certainly know the way
to a woman's heart.
l wasn't aiming that high.
[people clamoring]
- Are you all right?
- Your Majesty,
- how long do you stay in ltaly?
- We may stay some time.
Wallis, darling.
Turn around. Try to enjoy it.
David, are you sure these photos
won't run in England?
Don't worry, darling, Fleet Street and l
have an understanding.
Don't we, Slipper?
- l hope you're right.
- Well, Slipper's never wrong.
Your Majesty, his popularity
is not in question.
lt seems the worse he behaves
the more he is loved.
lt's a pretty kettle of fish we're in.
Fleet Street is all over me about this.
Even the American press
is starting to wag its tail.
Sign of the times,
isn't it, Prime Minister?
What are you suggesting?
l'm not suggesting anything,
Your Majesty.
He seems to have made his bed,
hasn't he?
[up-tempo music]
[man singing in ltalian]
[newspaperman shouts indistinctly]
Get a life.
Are you OK?
l'm fine.
l don't know what's wrong with me.
l don't know what's wrong
with you either.
Look, l'm due for a break.
Why don't we go get a cup of coffee?
OK? Come on.
[Evgeni] So what is
your thing with them?
- [Wally] My thing?
- The Duke and the Duchess.
- lt's a long story.
- Can you make it a short one?
Little girls love fairy tales?
- OK.
- The happily-ever-after kind.
How do you know
they lived happily ever after?
- Don't rain on my parade.
- Excuse me?
lt's an expression.
Yes, l know.
So tell me about your family.
- Like what?
- How's your mother?
My mother?
She named me after Wallis Simpson.
She and my grandmother
were obsessed with her.
l guess they wanted me
to marry a prince.
And did you?
That's the long story.
- What about you?
- What about me?
- Where are you from?
- Vermont.
Very funny.
Refugee camp in Vermont.
ln Vermont?
Vermont is full of surprises.
l like your watch.
Thank you.
- [Wallis] lt looks old.
- lt is. A gift.
From?
My wife.
- You're married?
- Was.
l'm raining on your parade again?
- [chuckling] No.
- You remind me of her.
ls that a good thing?
lt's not a bad thing.
[cell phone rings]
- Hello?
- [William] Hey, it's me.
- Hi, William.
- l'm not going to get home tonight.
This thing is running late,
and l'm behind at work.
l've got some papers to write.
Are you all right?
- You started dinner?
- [hangs up phone]
[panting]
[sobs]
[William] ls that why
you're dressed up like a whore?
[screaming]
[breathing heavily]
[man] Wallis sent us a letter
inviting us to Fort Belvedere,
first week in September.
Yes, it should be great fun!
We're used to getting
our invitations from you, David.
Oh, l'm happy to let Wallis
write my letters.
She's much better at it than l am.
How lucky you are.
How much longer will you
be staying in the... [stammers]
- South of France.
- [Edward] Until September.
So sorry for the delay.
Lunch will be ready any minute.
Edward was just telling us
how indispensable you've become to him.
And where is your husband these days,
Mrs. Simpson?
He's working.
ln London.
- [tires screeching]
- [crashing sound]
Wallis...
- ...you all right?
- Why do you ask?
- You left in such a hurry after lunch.
- Did l? l'm sorry.
Wallis. What's wrong?
Lunch with your brother
and sister-in-law.
- They are rather dull, aren't they?
- They'll never accept me.
You're gonna let Bertie and
Elizabeth dictate our future?
lt isn't just Bertie and Elizabeth.
lt's everyone.
lt won't be once we're married.
David, let's stop all this talk
about marriage. lt frightens me.
And l can't see any good coming of it.
Why?
Your family will never stand for it.
The prime minister won't stand for it!
Then l'll give up the throne!
And l will be the most
despised woman in the world.
Why do you belittle yourself? They would
be lucky to have you as their queen.
You're delusional!
lf l had any sense at all
l would just disappear.
Don't you understand?
You can do whatever you like,
go wherever you want,
but whatever you do... l'll follow you.
[dog barking]
[man] Quiet, Chester!
Apparently, she invited a string of
Americans to stay with them in Cannes.
How common.
[Elizabeth] Well, you know
how fond David is of Americans.
l'm sure the rumors
aren't entirely true, Your Majesty.
[man] Which rumors?
That he's... well,
rather serious about her.
What do you mean "serious?"
She's a married woman!
[man] David has always had
the most atrocious judgment.
l pray to God he never marries her
or has children.
Nothing comes between Bertie
and Lilibeth and the throne!
Your Majesty, David has always
been destined for greatness.
And in any case,
l'm sure it will never come to that.
- [dog barks]
- [man shouts]
Have you seen Father already?
- No.
- But we're meant to have dinner.
- l'm not staying.
- You promised.
[stammers] Please don't leave me
on my own with Father.
- l'm sorry, Bertie.
- David!
What shall l tell him?
[sighs]
l don't know. Tell him...
Tell him l've lost my appetite.
Wally! Hi.
- Evgeni.
- l was looking for you.
Um... [clears throat]
l have something
that l want to show you.
l think you'll be very interested in it.
But you have to go to the preview area
after we close and wait for me there.
Are you in a rush?
- No, l'm not.
- No?
OK.
Ten minutes.
[Dwayne] You can't you take her
to a bar like a normal person?
[Evgeni] Don't worry.
She practically works here.
That's good. 'Cause if anyone
finds out, we won't be.
Relax, baby.
l've got everything under control.
Shh.
Are you ready?
- [cork pops]
- Ooh!
A toast.
[speaks Russian]
What does that mean?
- To love and...
- Other disasters?
...to the time to enjoy her.
Cheers.
Please.
Oh, my God.
[plays quiet melody]
One more thing.
[Wally] Evgeni?
- What are you doing?!
- What does it look like l'm doing?
What? You don't want to try it on?
l don't want you to lose your job!
Why? Are you going to run off with it?
- Evgeni, no.
- Come on.
Relax. lt's a fake.
[man reporting] King George lll has
died, and the nation mourns.
As the popular Prince Edward
ascends the throne
the public are startled
by news of a romance
that threatens
the very monarchy itself.
The newly crowned King
intends to marry a commoner.
An American,
Mrs. Wallace Simpson,
and his decision has sparked
a constitutional crisis.
What are you
thinking about?
The strong-minded King is at odds with
Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin
who demands that the marriage
must not take place,
on pain of abdication.
What it must feel like
to be loved that much.
And what is your
definition of love?
He gave up everything
for her.
[Wallis] Why do people only
focus on what he gave up?
- That's true.
- What's true?
What about what l gave up?
[Wally] She gave up a lot, too.
My privacy. My freedom.
My reputation.
- l don't know how she did it.
- Did what?
l never looked
to the past.
l always wanted to embrace
the new things that life had to offer.
The whole world turned against her,
but she never backed down.
Darling, they can't hurt you...
...unless you let them.
l should go home.
- lt's getting late.
- OK.
Can l walk you home?
lf you put your pants on.
Right.
You play beautifully.
You see, we're not all gangsters.
No, you're not.
Thank you.
lt was my pleasure.
See you soon.
You don't want me
to walk you all the way?
lt's OK. l live just here.
Thanks.
[Wally] William?
William?
You here?
[Wallis echoing] Darling,
they can't hurt you...
...unless you let them.

[auctioneer] Ladies and gentlemen,
that concludes the auction for today.
- So... are you or aren't you?
- Huh?
- Going to bid on something?
- Oh, God no.
Why?
Too nerve-wracking.
Plus my husband would hate me wasting
money on something so trivial.
But...
it's not trivial to you.
He wouldn't see it that way.
He's a shrink. He'd find some
way to use it against me.
Mmm.
- Shall l walk you home?
- lt's OK. l'll take a cab.
OK.
[Wallis] l still don't understand why
l have to go to this dinner with you.
[Edward] Sooner or later my prime
minister must meet my future wife.
- Your future wife's still married.
- A technicality.
Ernest isn't a technicality.
He's still my husband.
He's been nothing but decent
through all of this.
Quite right.
But he's agreed to it, hasn't he?
And now it is just a matter of time.
You do realize l'll have
to go to Suffolk to file.
And then l'll have to live on a
bloody cow farm for six months.
Promise me you won't come and visit.
[Edward] l'm not promising
anything of the sort.
[Wallis] You have to.
l want a clean divorce.
l can't be associated
with you or any man.
- l'm not any man, l'm the king.
- Well, Your Majesty,
that's the law in your country.
[Edward] Then that's one more thing
l'm going to have to change.
You don't have to change everything.
Some things are better left alone.
But you're not one of those things.
l don't know what to say.
- [reporters shouting]
- [Edward] Don't say anything.
lt might be held against you.
How's your husband, Mrs. Simpson?
Get on back to where you came from!
Yankee harlot!

- [William] Home at last.
Why were you in the dark?
lnteresting day?
You're drunk.
OK, let's start again.
- lnteresting day?
- Not especially.
- Well, l had an interesting day.
- Don't you always?
l don't always get
a phone call from the bank.
About what?
You spent over $1 1 ,000 at Sotheby's.
l'll pay for it out of my own account.
Your own account? lt's all my money!
You're the one who won't let me work!
That's not the point.
When you're spending my money, you ask.
You mean the way l have to ask
if you're coming home every night?
Or the way l have to make
an appointment to speak to you?
- This is not about me!
- To spend time with you?
Or the way l have to ask you for sex?
Why don't you want to have sex with me?
- William?
- Please, Wally!
Don't do this to me right now.
lf you're having an affair...
- ...just tell me.
- Get off!
William...
l want to know,
where do you go every night?
Tell me.
Answer me.
Answer me!
- [grunts] Answer me!
- Stop it.
That's right...
You go make yourself another drink.
Maybe that'll help you get it up.
- You...
- [breathing heavily]
You have no respect!
What did you spend all my money on?
l fucking feed you,
l clothe you,

You couldn't even give me a kid if

Hello, Wallis? Are you there?
[Wallis sobbing] Yes, l'm here.
[Edward] l need you, Wallis.
[Wallis] Your country needs you.
[Edward] l'm no good
to my country without you.
[Wallis] You and l can only
create disaster together.
Please, David!
- Please let me go!
- You don't understand.
lt's all over.
The instrument of abdication...
...is already prepared.
The what?
The only condition under which
l can remain in England...
...is if l renounce you
for all time.
And l will never agree to that.
Wallis? Are you there?
[Wallis] "Dear David, this is
a difficult letter to write.
l must really return to Ernest.
I feel secure with him,
and l'm only left with my side
of the show to run.
True, we're unable to do the attractive,
amusing things in life,
which I must confess,
l do love and enjoy,
but weighed against a calm,
congenial life, l'd choose the latter.
For l know, that though
l shall suffer greatly now,
l shall be a happier, calmer old lady.
I'm sure, dear David,
that in a few months
your life will run again
as it did before.
l shall always read about you.
And you will know,
l want you to be happy.
l feel sure l can't make you so.
[thunder rumbles]
And I honestly don't think you can me."
Ladies and gentlemen, sadly
and wonderfully, the final lot.
- Lot 432, the abdication desk.
- [applause]
The desk where King Edward delivered
his final speech as King of England.
But before the bidding begins,
we'd like to show the actual newsreel
of this most historic event.
[man on TV] ln Windsor Castle,
the greatest drama of our time
approaches its world-stirring climax.
London is tense with excitement.
Crowds gather at 1 0 Downing Street.
Prime Minister Baldwin
leaves for Parliament.
ln his pocket is the document signed
by the king, announcing his renunciation
to his 500 million subjects
throughout the world.
From the House of Commons
comes the word that shocks the empire.
King and Emperor Edward Vlll prepares
to publically renounce his throne
for the woman he loves.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we interrupt our programs at this time
to present a most momentous address,
by Mr. David Windsor,
former King Edward Vlll of England.
[man 2] This is Windsor Castle.
His Royal Highness, Prince Edward.
[indistinct voices on radio]
[Edward on radio] At long last,
l'm able to say a few words of my own.
l've never wanted to withhold anything.
But until now, it has not been
constitutionally possible
for me to speak.
A few hours ago,
l discharged my last duty
as King and Emperor.
And now that I have been succeeded
by my brother, the Duke of York,
my first words must be
to declare my allegiance to him.
This l do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which
have impelled me to renounce the throne.
But l want you to understand
that in making up my mind
l did not forget
the country or the empire,
which, as Prince of Wales,
and lately as King, l have,
for 25 years, tried to serve.
But you must believe me when l tell you
that l have found it impossible
to carry the heavy burden
of responsibility
and to discharge my duties as king
without the help and support
of the woman l love.
This decision has been
made less difficult to me
by the sure knowledge that my brother,
with his long training
in the public affairs of this country...
...will be able to take my place
without interruption
or injury to the life
and progress of the empire.
And he has one matchless blessing,
enjoyed by so many of you,
and not bestowed on me...
...a happy home
with his wife and children.
Ever since l was Prince of Wales,
and later on,
when l occupied the throne,
l have been treated with the greatest
kindness by all classes of the people
wherever l have lived or
journeyed throughout the empire.
[indistinct voices]
For that l am very grateful.
[indistinct chanting]
l now quit altogether public affairs...
...and l lay down my burden.
And now, we all have a new king.
l wish him and you, his people,
happiness and prosperity
with all my heart.
God bless you all.
God save the king.
[chanting] Long live the king!
Long live the king!
God save the king.
[auctioneer] Two hundred and twenty-five
thousand. You are a splendid audience.
Four hundred thousand dollars!
Four hundred thousand.
Four twenty-five!
At four hundred and twenty-five
thousand dollars in the center.
Any more at four twenty-five?
ln the center.
[dialing cell phone]
[ringing]
You've reached Wally.
Please leave a message.
Excuse me, Tenten.
Sorry, have you seen Wally today?
No.
Have you spoken to her? Do you know
if she's going to be coming in?
Maybe she's got something better to do?
No, there's no way she'd miss
the last day of the auction.
[Evgeni] Uh, is Mrs. Winthrop in?
- Who may l say is calling?
- Evgeni Kolpakov.
From Sotheby's.
[glass crunching]
Hello?
Wally?
- What happened?
- [shuddering]
Who did this to you?
lt's OK. l'm here.
You're OK? Shh. lt's OK.
[reporters clamoring]
[man reporting] From the
House of Commons comes the word
that shocks the empire.
The king is going into exile.
For God's sake!
Quick, quick!
On the floor! On the floor!
[clamoring]
Come inside, Wallis. You poor thing.
Welcome.
l'm going to put your things
in the bedroom, OK?
l'll sleep out on the sofa.
Bathroom is right in here.
OK? So...
What happened to your wife?
She died.
Three years ago.
Will you play something for me?
Yeah.
[plays low-tempo music]
Here are the keys.
Feel free to snoop around.
See you tonight?
[clock chiming]
[people chattering]
[man singing]
[Wallis] Pain under the ribs.
Under the heart.
The struggle between it and the brain,
to gain the upper hand.
The brain trying continuously
to rationalize.
To mend.
To save the situation.
The pain clawing
and tearing like a bird of prey.
[thunder rumbles]
Where'd you learn to play like that?
My grandfather taught me.
He had great expectations.
You know what they say.
What do they say?
Expectations lead to disappointment.
[both grunt]
[Wallis] Darling...
...l know this can't come
as a complete shock.
God knows it was
never planned or wished for.
Our marriage has become untenable.
lt's unfair of me to continue
to string you along...
...especially now that the king
has made his intentions clear.
You know l adore you.
And I hope you will
find it in your heart...
...to forgive me.
[whispering] Tonight...
...l love the whole pathetic,
glorious, ridiculous world.
And you, my darling,
most of all and more than ever.
OK, this place is fantastic.
- What's it called?
- Zablozki's.
- lt's Russian?
- Of course. What else.
- Me break?
- You break.
You didn't leave me anything.
What am l meant to hit?
- The ball.
- From here?
A little softer.
Oh!
[telephone rings]
Good morning, Black Box Gallery,
can l help you?
- [man] ls Thierry there?
- Tomorrow. l can take a message.
- No, I'll call back.
- OK. Bye.
- [dials telephone]
- [ringing]
- [Tenten] Hello?
- Tenten. lt's Wally.
- Wally!
- Did you see the piece in the news
- about the letters?
- Yeah, why?
Do you know Mohammed Al Fayed well
enough to arrange a meeting for me?
- Why do you want to meet with him?
- l have to read those letters.
- OK...
- l know it sounds crazy.
- What are you thinking?
- l'll say l'm a writer,
- that l'm writing a book.
- OK. Let me see what l can do.
OK. Thanks, Tenten.
l've decided to go to Paris.
[Evgeni] Sounds romantic.
[Wally] Tenten arranged a meeting
for me, with Mohammed Al Fayed.
- [Evgeni] Mohammed Al Fayed?
- Apparently he has hundreds of letters,
that he decided not to sell.
[Evgeni] Why do you need to read them?
l need to find something out.
[Wally] Thank you.
[woman speaking French]
Did the duke and duchess
really stay in this suite?
Madame, why else would we call it
"The Duke and Duchess
of Windsor Suite?"
Right.
Please show Madame
the Duke and Duchess's Suite.
- l shall wait outside, madam.
- Merci.
[Edward] Hello, operator.
l'd like to place a call
to Buckingham Palace, London.
It's the Duke of Windsor,
calling from Paris.
Yes, it's urgent!
l know how busy he is. Please remind him
before he was king he was my brother.
Right. You keep placing
the blame on Downing Street.
Downing Street places it on the Palace.
ln the meantime,
the duchess and l are no closer
to coming home to England.
Your Majesty, His Royal Highness,
the Duke of Windsor
is calling from Paris.
- He says it's urgent.
- The king is otherwise engaged.
You know what he's calling about
and you'll give in
if you speak to him.
- He's my brother.
- The last thing you need
is your brother, the Nazi,
dashing around England
with that trollop of a wife.
He didn't know. Nobody knew!
They dined together.
That is enough for me.
[stammers] Churchill dined with Stalin!
My brother is not a Nazi.
You're not being...
We're struggling to maintain an empire.
And you're doing so well.
- Tell him l'm busy.
- [man] Yes, Your Majesty.
What a degradation.
Being kept out of England
by my own brother.
Don't they understand
l just want to serve my country?
They don't want a folk legend
waltzing back into the country,
and stealing Bertie's thunder.
- l'm not a folk legend!
- l warned you this would happen.
l wasn't even allowed to fight
in the Great War for God's sake.
l had to stand and watch
while brave men died.
How can they deny me this,
after everything l've given up?
You wouldn't listen. l warned you they
would never accept me as your wife,
with or without a title.
We've got nowhere to go. What kind of
life do you think we're going to have,
wandering around as the world's
most celebrated parasites!
[sobbing]
At least you have each other.
This isn't some kind
of fairy tale. Wake up!
[gasps]
[vomits]
Madame Montague?
Monsieur Al Fayed is expecting
you. Please come with me.
[Wally] l read that you kept
a collection of letters
from the duke and the duchess.
Yes. Hundreds.
And in amazing condition.
Why didn't you put those up for auction?
[clears throat]
Miss Montague...
...when you buy an inkpot or a dress
you cannot add to it an opinion.
But when someone reads a letter,
especially an intimate one,
this is open to interpretation.
Would it be possible
for me to look at them?
l don't generally show them to anyone.
Mr. Al Fayed, l completely understand
and respect everything you've said.
lt's just l think it's important
to tell the story
from her point of view.
From the point of view
of the foreigner...
...who fell in love with a royal.
People seem to only focus
on what he gave up for her.
But what about what she gave up?
They never consider that.
[exhales]
Let me think about it.
How much longer
will you be staying in Paris?
As long as it takes for you to say yes.
lt was a pleasure meeting you,
Miss Montague.
You too, Mohammed.
- [Wally] Hi.
- [woman] There is a message for you,
- from the office of Monsieur Al Fayed.
- Merci.
Monsieur Al Fayed apologized
that he can't be here.
The letters are
in that box on the table.
Thank you.
[man] l will leave you alone.
[door closes]
[Wallis] "Dearest Aunt B... We arrived
Thursday and once again, it's raining.
lt's so dull for the women
as there's no form of excitement here.
Darling, l'm so sorry for
not having written for a month,
but l can't begin to tell you
what my life has been.
The Duke remains despondent
by the behavior of his family.
The constant whisperings
that we supported Hitler
and his diabolical behavior
are preposterous.
The rumors hang
over us like a black cloud.
ln spite of my efforts to cheer him up,
he's often inconsolable.
Sometimes it seems l have no one but you
to lighten my burden.
Aunt Bessie, I feel ashamed
to admit l feel suffocated
by his constant attention.
Like a child, he continues to
bemoan his lack of usefulness.
Yet, how can l change
that which l caused?
He used me to escape his prison
only to incarcerate me in my own.
The US press has practically ruined
two people's lives,
however, they go on, hounding away.
lt does get one's morale down.
But l'm so tired of it all.
Even my heart has been acting up
and l've been put to bed
for a week's complete rest.
- No calls, no callers.
- [reporters clamoring]
Everything everywhere
seems to get worse and worse,
and you can't help
but be depressed by it all.
We have nothing but a series
of unpleasant business.
l cried myself to sleep last night.
No talks to a boy.
And today, all the lines
are down in Cannes.
l really can't continue to carry on
with all of England taking cracks at me
and no decent society speaking to me.
What have l done
to deserve this treatment?
l've never had a word said in my defense
or a kind word in the press.
Oh, Aunt Bessie,
l feel l've disappointed him.
Though he'd never let on.
l know how badly
the duke wanted children."
[Wallis echoing] Win, not the baby!
"l'm sorry to bother you, my darling,
but l feel like an animal in a trap
and there's two buzzards
working me over.
By the way, you're losing
your popularity through me.
Together, l suppose, we're strong enough
to face this mean world.
But separated, l feel...
and scared for you, your safety.
Hold me tight, please, David.
[whispering] lt is not an enemy
who has done this thing.
But mine own familiar friend.
[echoing] ...familiar friend.
[both] You have no idea how hard it is
to live out the greatest romance
of the century.
And now, l will have
to be with him always.
And now l'll...
have to be with him always.
And always and always."
What shall we do tonight?
Shall l read to you?
Would you like me to rub your feet?
l want you to dance.
Dance for me, Wallis.
[starts record]
[♪ Chubby Checker: "The Twist"]
[footsteps approaching]
Wally, hi.
l've got some good news for you.
- [birds chirping]
- [people chattering]
[Wallis] Well...
...l suppose this is goodbye.
l suppose it is.
l think these belong to you.
l often find myself wondering
if there was some sort of plan
that controlled my life.
My Aunt Bessie insists that
l've always had one germinating
in the back of my mind
for everything l've done.
