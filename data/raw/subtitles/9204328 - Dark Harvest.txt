It's Halloween.
You know what that means.
Old Sawtooth Jack is gonna
rise from the cornfields
and try to make its way
to the church
before midnight.
It's gotta be stopped.
Kill or be killed.
'Cause see,
out here,
where the wind
blows fierce
and the dust
rolls in...
you gotta give something
to get something back.
It's what has to be done.
What's always been done.
But you already
know about this.
After all,
you grew up here.
You know the story
as well as I do.
Over there.
Okay. Look, look, look.
Come on. Come on.
I think
I saw something.
There!
Let's go!
Over there!
It's Jim! It's Jim!
Come on, Jim!
Get him! Get him! Get him!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Jim's the winner!
Jim's the winner!
Jim's the winner!
Jim's the winner!
Jim's the winner!
Jim's the winner!
Yeah!
Jim's the winner!
Jim's the winner!
Jim's the winner!
Jim's the winner!
Whoo!
Jim's the winner!
Jim's the winner!
We,
the Harvester's Guild,
present to you,
the Shepard family,
a fresh start.
A brand new beginning
in a new model home.
Thanks to
your brave service,
we can now move beyond
the darkness of this...
...unfortunate night.
And move optimistically
into another long
and fruitful year
of peace,
prosperity,
and prize crops.
With you, Jim,
as our emissary
to the larger world,
riding high
in a brand new,
shiny...
Corvette.
Well, let the midnight dance
begin!
I'll write soon.
Take me with you.
Come here.
I love you, Baby B.
There ain't no stop signs
on the black road!
Oh, fuck, dude!
Damn these kids!
The reaper
that grows in the field.
The trick
with a heart
made of treats.
The butchering nightmare
with the saw teeth...
And he's gonna get you.
That's what they always
told you.
He's gonna get you...
So, you know
you've been got.
Laugh it up.
No, get it all out
now 'cause,
this is not
a fucking game!
One of your classmates
will certainly die.
That thing grows
all year long in our fields,
only to rise up
every Halloween night
with a single,
solitary purpose.
To destroy
our way of life.
Hey, we're gonna
win this thing.
Get the slide.
You've all heard
the stories
about that one time
we failed at our duties.
And that black duster
rolled in and destroyed
our crops, our lives.
It must die,
so we can live.
Your sacred duty,
is to take down
Sawtooth Jack
before that church bell
rings at midnight.
And to get you
fat little nancies ready,
we make you
hungry for it.
Three days.
No food, no mommy,
no nothing.
Locked up alone
in your bedrooms
to sit and think long and hard
about what you have to do.
And on
the night of the Run,
when one of you
fulfills your duty,
you all will fill
your bellies full.
Now the fun stuff.
Thank you, Officer Ricks.
So...
Who wants
to be the coolest kid
with the hottest car
in town?
Chevrolet Corvette, 1964.
Next year's model.
Winner
of this year's Run
gets the keys
to this beautiful tank of gas,
and some traveling
around money.
A gift from
the Harvester's Guild.
Jim Shepard,
last year's winner,
he, uh...
he's out in California.
Seeing the world. Now...
The fuck
is he doing here?
Oh.
His big brother won,
and now he thinks
he's Mr. Westside.
Gets a chickenshit waiver.
I'm doing it.
Who fucking volunteers
to do the Run?
Huh? We all...
We don't have a choice.
Some of us do.
They can force us
to do the Run,
but no one can force me
to kill anything.
Shut up, pinko.
This whole thing
is horseshit.
It's rigged.
Sawtooth, too.
You really think
that's friggin' real?
Officer Friendly there?
He buses in
a boogie inmate
from the Dixie Springs
Correctional.
I heard this, too.
He stuffs his britches
full of candy,
puts on a big fat pumpkin,
on his woolly head...
and boo.
I saw it.
It's real.
When was this?
When I was nine.
My mom, she, uh,
told me not to look outside,
no matter what I heard.
But...
I looked outside
my window anyway.
He was there.
Who?
Sawtooth Jack.
I saw it.
On my neighbor's porch,
in the old Partridge place,
before they moved
to the Westside...
Shut the fuck up.
Beaner.
What do you know about
doin' the Run?
Mexicans ain't even
allowed to win.
-Fuck you.
-Bullshit, says who?
Whoa, Westside Boy
getting mad now.
Get bent.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
You don't belong here.
Come on.
Out!
The movie
already started.
No, I know.
I, uh...
You hiding?
What?
No.
I, uh, wanted a snack.
Most kids go to Waltons.
Waltons doesn't
have jujubes.
We don't have jujubes.
Right.
You know...
Can I just have a small
buttered popcorn?
Riley Blaike
is a real asshole.
Who?
On the house.
Really?
Why not?
Betcha.
You're Jim Shepard's brother.
You're the new girl.
I know a lot
about your brother, but...
I don't know anything
about you.
I'm hard to pin down.
Sure.
Could I get me a pop, too?
You know what?
I've never met someone
from somewhere else before.
Where you from?
Another small town.
You're not going
on a trip, are you?
One day.
Are you going
to the midnight dance?
I'm not invited.
Why not?
Well, after I win the Run,
I'll make sure
you get invited.
You can duck into the movie,
if you want. It just started.
Nah. I should really...
Dig you later.
Be careful out there.
-That girl is trouble.
-Who?
The betty
you're makin' eyes at.
She's fuckin' bad news.
Burned down
Old Man Bagley's barn.
The one we used
to throw rocks at?
-Where'd you hear that?
-Pat Shanley.
Says she lit up that old
mine shaft, too,
over on Route 12.
Hey, you better
watch yourself, man.
She's got an axe to grind.
This way.
Oh.
Hear your brother's
up in Santa Clara.
What's he doin' up there?
Seeing the world, I guess.
Well,
they got a great
varsity team.
When are you gonna
play ball, aye?
Not my thing.
Well,
if you have half
the arm your brother has,
we'd be in good shape. Hey.
You oughta think about it.
You know,
maybe he
is up in Santa
whatever, I dunno,
who fucking cares?
I don't wanna go home.
-Let's breeze outta here.
-Hey, so...
What?
It's curfew.
Don't be such
a pantywaist, Bud.
Come on,
come smoke with us.
But it's curfew.
What?
See you guys tomorrow?
So that's
your big idea?
Come on, man.
You should do it.
You know I'm not allowed.
Fuck it. Just 'cause
your brother won
the Run last year?
Look, Jim's
a great guy and all...
-but you're faster.
-I know that.
-Tougher.
-You know...
Try telling that to my folks,
all right?
They worship the ground
my brother walks on.
It's embarrassing.
If I was to make a bet...
Scout's honor?
I'd pick you
over your brother
to win the Run any day.
You really mean that?
Really?
Shit, I say we
do it together, man,
You and me, let's do it.
You know, and then
I can move into
your neighborhood again.
We can live next door
to each other,
just like before.
Like nothing's changed,
you know?
We better get going.
Dear Lord, bless this food
and grant that we may
thankful for thy mercies be.
Amen.
Amen.
Oh.
This came for you today.
This is it?
No letter, no nothing?
I saw Annie last night.
At... At Bible study.
Poor gal. She still holds
a flame for Jimmy.
And who can
blame her, really?
It's not her fault.
She doesn't have the same kind
of opportunities that we do.
You're very lucky.
So I've heard.
- Watch your tone, boy.
- What?
She talks like we weren't
living on the East Side
just a year ago.
When he comes home
for Christmas,
Jimmy will have
to set Annie straight.
I'd hate to see that girl
get her heart broken,
but...
Been doing a lot
of thinking lately.
Thinking about what?
Doing the Run, maybe.
Why would you say that?
Jim got to do it.
Why can't I?
Because your brother won.
So?
Richie, listen to me.
Everything you see,
all this,
the house, the car...
We already have it.
You can't win it again, son.
It's not... It's not fair
to the other boys,
-and the other families.
-Donna. Donna.
What you want,
it doesn't matter.
And you know this.
You know this.
So I need to
hear you tell me
why it does not matter
what you want?
Tell me right now
because why?
- Because why?
- Because it's against the--
Because it's against
the rules, that's right.
Fuck the rules.
I...
I'm the bad kid?
-Sorry.
-Is that it?
I'm the bad kid,
and Jim's the good kid?
I'm just supposed to be
thankful and lucky
for the rest of my life?
For what?
This big house
and your shitty Cadillac?
I'm good at things, too,
you know.
Please sit down.
I'm smart.
You're my baby boy.
Richie, please.
I'm doing the Run.
You can't stop me.
Richie.
Hi, Richie.
You're homesick
for the East Side?
Annie.
Got a postcard today.
I've always wanted
to go to New Orleans.
Hey, asshole.
You think you're better
than me, huh?
You think you're special,
smart guy, huh?
What's this? What's this?
I'll be taking this.
No. No. No.
Give it back.
You don't have
the stones.
Whoo!
How are you
Jim Shepard's brother?
Whoo!
" I looked
up one day and...
saw it was one year later
and I thought,
'Hey, Baby B
must be 18 by now.'
Happy belated.
So, you're probably
sore at me
for not writing
a proper letter sooner,
and I'm sorry about that.
I can't have you come out
right now, not just yet.
All this traveling
and seeing the country
can get pretty lonely.
I think about coming
back home sometimes.
Maybe get hitched
to good old Annie,
if she'd take me back.
Get a job at the mill.
Settle down for good.
Ah, but heck,
I can't come home now
with everyone thinking
I'm some hero or something.
I know every dumbass kid
wants to be tough
and prove himself, but...
if I were you,
I'd just stay put."
"Winning the Run
ain't everything."
"I'll be home soon,
I promise you that,
okay?
Just be good for now
and watch after
Mom and Dad.
They need you."
There ain't no stop signs
on the black road!
Where do you think
you're going?
Get out of the car, Richie.
Shit.
Mom.
Let me out!
Let me out!
Open the fucking door!
I don't wanna do the Run!
Let me out
of this fucking room!
-Open the fucking door!
-Let me out!
I'm fucking starving!
I know
you fucking hear me!
I fucking hate you!
I fucking hate you!
Mom! Dad!
I'm so fucking hungry.
I'm so fucking hungry.
Just a slice of bread.
A glass of water.
Anything!
-Please!
-Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Open the fucking door!
I said open
the fucking door!
I'm so fucking hungry!
Think he'll make it?
He'll make it.
You got yourself a pretty bad
bump on the head, boy.
How long was I out?
Three days.
Whoa, whoa. Easy.
Listen. Joe Grant,
I spoke to him...
And I got a job for you
over at the Perry Mill
right after you graduate.
And then you can
start working there
full time.
I'm doing the Run.
Just...
You're not hearing me, son.
You're gonna listen to me.
Come here, son. No.
No, no, no. Richie.
Richie!
Richie!
Your favorite.
I just made them.
Pray with me.
Pray with me.
Let me go.
Let me go.
Let. Me. Go.
You guys have
anything to eat?
My old man
found my stash.
I'd cut my fuckin' nuts off
for a Twinkie, man.
Whoo!
Shit!
Fuck!
Crenshaw
and his rattletrap.
Hey,
that ain't playing fair.
He can't drive a friggin'
truck, can he?
You're not allowed
to do that.
Says who,
ya fuckin' square?
Says me!
- Get out!
- We'll see.
Run!
Run!
Try it again.
You're giving
it too much gas.
There he is.
Come on!
-You made it.
-Who do you think
you're dealin' with?
Where'd it go?
The fuck hell
you doin', huh?
You think
you're tough?
Huh?
- Oh, yeah.
- Y'all just pissed off
you didn't think of it
yourselves, losers.
Give it a little gas,
not a lot.
There we go.
Hey, back off!
All of youse!
See ya at
the dance, fuckos.
Hey, screw you, Crenshaw,
you cheat!
Hey, get your ass
out of that truck
and on the street!
Whoo!
Here. These are for you.
You guys ready?
Come on...
Come on
to the violent world
with me.
My mom
gave me a sleeping pill.
With warm milk.
And honey.
What the hell
are you talking about?
I was wide awake.
I could hear
the older boys outside,
hunting for it like dogs.
You okay, Bud?
I saw it.
Saw Sawtooth rise up,
floating over some kid,
some older kid,
and I was waving at him,
yelling.
Trying to warn him, but...
What's the matter
with you?
It was too late.
He turned around and...
Shit!
Fuck!
- Shit!
- Where'd it go?
Could be... Could be
the whole thing's over.
Could be, right?
It ain't over.
Come on.
I'm good.
Skid marks start here.
See if there's
any more footprints
down in that ditch.
Shine the light
up there.
Hey, don't!
Kill first.
Eat later.
Remember?
I'm so fucking hungry.
You must've hit him, Mitch.
Busted him open
like a pinata.
You won.
Where's the body?
Hey, hey.
What?
There!
Charlie?
Charlie?
Charlie?
Charlie!
Charlie?
Bud, no!
Charlie!
There!
Richie...
Let's go.
Bud?
Bud?
Bud, where you going?
God.
You saw it?
Did you kill it?
Then let's go kill it.
Hey, hey.
Don't go that way.
You're gonna want
a better weapon
than that, trust me.
-Like what?
-Like a fucking gun.
Do you have a gun?
Here.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
You can't win this alone.
What? You want
the prize money
when I win it?
-Is that it?
-No.
I don't give a shit
about the prize money.
Then why are you
doing this?
Girls aren't even allowed
to do the Run.
Neither are you.
Fuck the rules.
Fuck 'em.
I got an idea.
Mommy, please. Let me in.
Mommy, please.
Mom, let me in. Please.
Do us proud. Now.
I don't wanna die, Mom.
-Do us proud. Go.
-Mommy.
Mommy, please.
We need this.
Okay, honey?
We need this.
Hey, hey.
Be a man!
-Do me proud.
-Mommy.
Bud!
Bud! Bud!
Bud!
Watch out!
Bud!
Look out!
Bud!
Look out behind you!
Look out behind you, Bud!
Sawtooth is behind you!
Please! Please!
Sawtooth's behind you!
Sawtooth is behind
you, Bud! Look out!
It's Bud. Let me in.
- Let me in!
- There's no room.
I'm not big, come on.
- Let me in.
- Twenty bucks.
I don't have 20 bucks.
That's what everyone
else paid, so...
I'll pay you back tomorrow,
first thing, promise.
-Just... Just...
-Cash up front, man.
-That's the deal.
-Please.
Look, it wouldn't be fair
to everyone if...
No, no. Let me in.
Let me in!
Open the door!
-Open the door!
-Turn off the lights.
- Turn off the lights.
- Open the door!
Turn off the lights!
Help me! Help me!
Let me in!
Please, let me in!
Don't open it.
He... He's hurt.
Shouldn't we...
- I'm not opening it.
- Please... help me.
-We can't just let him die.
-I'm not opening it!
-We have to help him.
-No. Don't.
-We gotta get him
outta there.
-No fuckin' way.
- Please! Please!
- Stop!
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home.
What are we doing here?
Keep an eye out.
Jesus!
Take this.
This is why
we stopped here?
That's my dad.
Your dad?
Why did your dad
come here?
Come on.
Whose house is that?
Officer...
Dick's.
You wanna go for a ride?
Get your pansy ass out here!
You thought
I wouldn't find out, huh?
I got eyes and ears
everywhere, Chief.
I know every single
goddamn thing
that's going on this here--
Do not!
Fuck!
Where did you learn
how to do that?
I know things.
Okay.
So...
What's the plan?
That was my plan.
Get a gun.
Jer, you there? Over.
Jerry, the burglar alarm
at Jarrett's
is ringing like crazy.
There's some big commotion
going on over there
on Main Street.
Someone said
they spotted Sawtooth.
What the fuck? Get back!
Get... Hey.
Get back. Get back.
Give us
a fucking sandwich.
Get back!
Is that all
ya got, savages?
Back!
Oh. Oh.
Oh, fuck off.
My dad's
gonna kill me.
Jesus Christ.
We better move.
A girl?
The fuck is all this?
Hey...
What are you doing,
Shepard?
Let her go.
Wait...
Wait
a pick-a-ninny minute here.
Are you making it
with a Negro?
Let her go...
now.
Uh...
Why don't you fight
me for her?
Ugh! You little bitch!
My nose. My nose.
You got a gun?
I got a gun.
That's not fair.
That's a gun.
And she's a girl.
And I'm a Negro.
With a club.
That fair enough for you?
I'll be taking this.
Let's go.
Whoo!
You're looking at
this year's winner
of the Run.
Any of youse doubt it?
Yeah! Yeah!
What about you, copper?
Think you got what it takes?
Come and get it.
Front for a rock band
in Jersey?
Where'd you hear that?
It's what
everyone's saying.
No. No one is saying that.
I heard he got an album
coming out.
Teenagers From Mars.
Jim Shepard
is not in a rock band,
okay?
He couldn't carry a tune
even if he...
"HG."
What is that, like,
"The Harvester's Guild,"
maybe?
They own
the movie theater.
They own everything.
If you wanna leave town,
even for a vacation,
I heard you have to ask
for the Guild's permission.
That can't be true.
You're not like
other girls around here,
that's for sure.
Let's try this.
What do you know about me?
What have you heard?
People say you're...
Uh...
What?
I don't know.
Pat Shanley says
you burned down
Old Man Bagley's barn.
Why would I do that?
I don't know.
That's stupid.
Forget it.
It doesn't matter.
What else have you heard?
Pat Shanley also said
you burned down
the old mine shaft, too.
Who is this Pat Shanley?
He's got a big mouth.
I mean, is that what
people are saying,
that I'm some
kind of pyromaniac?
It doesn't matter.
They're lying.
Okay.
Hey, look,
I didn't believe him, okay?
And it doesn't matter,
either.
I mean, who cares, right?
This town?
People talk.
They like to run their mouths
about things they know
nothing about.
I know.
Like my brother?
Everybody's got
their own opinion
about where he's at,
what he's doing.
Like he's some sort of...
hero.
But Jim,
he was just my brother,
you know?
He's just a normal kid
like me. Nothing special.
I mean, he played baseball
real good. Sure.
But even after some big game,
he still found time
to hang out with me.
Work on cars.
We really liked
to work on cars.
We were more like
best friends.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
He doesn't want
to be found, I guess.
I get that.
My parents are dead.
Car accident.
Last summer.
My dad, he lived here
long before I was born.
He never talked
about this place,
except how he never
wanted to come back.
So...
After the war,
he settled
somewhere else.
Met my mom,
had me.
That's why
I was sent here.
I live with
my auntie now and...
She don't like me
all that much, you know?
She thinks I'm wild.
Wild?
I burned down
Old Man Bagley's barn.
Oh.
He called me
a nasty name.
He had it coming.
What about
the old mine shaft?
That was just for fun.
Bitchin'.
Jer, are you there? Over.
Jerry, I just got a call.
Sawtooth was spotted alone,
hiding over on Oak Street
in front of the Guild's
Country Club.
It's getting
close to midnight,
so you might want to tip off
some of the boys
to his location. Over.
Good work, Edith.
I owe you one.
You betcha.
Jesus.
The hell's
going on out here?
You get your ass
back out there. Now!
What the hell
happened to you back there?
Stupid.
I'm so fucking stupid.
Why didn't you...
All these boys...
Don't fucking move.
Out of the car now.
You know
somethin', Ricks?
I don't think I care much
for this Podunk town anymore.
Out!
Of the car.
This guy's
stuck in one gear.
You.
Kelly Haines.
I know you.
I knew your mommy
and your daddy, too.
Ooh, he had a lip on him,
your dad.
He tried to get away
by jumping the line, but...
I caught up with him. Hmm?
They thought they
could get away, too.
See how that turned out.
Go, go!
You mother...
Fuck!
Richie, you came home.
Who's your friend?
Get some ice and towels.
Do it!
Here.
Who won the Run
the year before Jimmy?
Curtis Johnson, of course.
Where is he now?
Somewhere East.
East of Eden,
was the name of the book
he wrote, I think.
He's a famous writer now.
That can't be right.
And the year before that?
Bobby Rokos.
What happened to him?
He died
in a terrible car accident.
You know that.
And the year
before that?
Doug Steckles.
You remember.
What happened
to Doug Steckles?
Richie,
I don't understand.
Why all the questions?
There ain't
no stop signs
on the black road!
Jim's the winner!
Jim's the winner!
Jim's the winner!
Jim's the winner!
I need you
to be honest with me.
Okay.
Don't lie.
Lie?
Did you write the letter?
What letters?
The letter from the other day,
did you write that?
The postcards?
Did you pretend you were Jim
to get me to stay home?
Mom, please.
No. I...
Honey, why would I do that?
Please. Come on. Tell me.
Mom.
Are you sure you
don't want another cupcake?
Mom.
Let me get you some milk.
Mom.
Mom!
Tell me the truth.
Please.
It has to end.
Mom?
Put an end to it, Richie.
Mom? What the fuck!
What now?
I'm not doing it.
I've had enough.
There's only so much
a man can take before...
Yeah, you're gonna do
what needs to be done.
And that's that.
This fucking night.
You and your wife,
you like living in that
big house you're living in?
Hmm?
It's...
not worth it.
Casey.
You remember
my brother Casey?
When Casey went missing,
my old man,
he marched straight out
into that dust storm
to go look for him.
For hours, me and my sister
were alone in that house,
the wind rattling at
the walls, the windows...
And when that black duster
finally passed, days later...
I found my big brother.
He was a hundred yards
from the front door, just...
lying there,
bloated...
An arm reaching out
for our house.
And when my old man
fell to his knees
and lifted his eldest
into his arms...
Casey's body,
it split open
and sand poured
out of his belly.
That freak
made it to the church
before midnight
one goddamn time...
and for nine
long fuckin' years
this town went
a little mad,
and all because of some
panty waisted daddy
who didn't have the stones
to do what needed to be done.
Are you that guy, Dan?
Huh?
If that thing isn't dead
by midnight,
this whole goddamn town
is going straight to Hell,
and your wife and that
piece of shit son of yours
are gonna find themselves...
...buried in a cornfield
somewhere.
He's your responsibility.
Huh?
Get it done.
We could sneak out.
While everyone is preoccupied
with the Run,
we could leave.
Get out. Just...
Run away.
Let's run away, Richie.
No.
Why not? Let's just go.
Get out of this
fucking place now.
If he gets to the church
in time, then...
There will be no winner...
To sacrifice.
I'm ending this.
Tonight.
I'm coming with you.
Jer, we got a call on a fire
over on Maple Avenue.
The old Shepard house,
I think. Over.
I'm on my way.
Over and out.
- Whoa, hey.
- Relax.
The hell do you want?
- Sawtooth.
- Huh?
I just saw him. He's...
He's a couple blocks over,
in front of the Healy place.
Everything's gone
nuts tonight.
-Get in the car.
-What?
Get in the car!
Where are we going?
Congratulations, kid.
You're this year's
big winner.
What the...
Come on.
Let's go look.
Where'd everyone go?
Do you see anything?
No.
Let's check inside.
Dad?
What are you doing here?
Just doing
what has to be done.
I know the truth.
Not all of it.
I'm going to save him.
Richie, I need you
to listen to--
I'm going to end
all of it.
Listen!
There's no winning
this thing, son.
If that...
thing...
walks through the church door
before midnight, I--
Say his name.
I came here to stop...
Say his name!
I...
Say his name!
Say. His. Name.
Jim.
Jim.
Your brother.
My son.
I came here to...
To stop my own son.
He has to lose. Again...
Knowing what you knew...
Richie, I swear to you,
I didn't know
anything at first.
When Jim won the Run,
your mother and I...
We were thrilled.
Then we were brought
into the Guild
and we were
told the truth.
And we were
sworn to secrecy
and that was that.
That was that.
I never had a say
in any of this, Richie.
None of us did.
-Not me. Not your mother--
-Why didn't we just leave?
Because they
would have killed us!
If you're born in this town,
you're cursed.
They would have
murdered us.
-No one can ever leave, son.
-Who?
-They'll...
-Who?
Ricks.
The Harvester's Guild.
Richie, look at me.
Look at me, son.
Tonight, some other boy
will win the Run
and we will move on.
You understand me?
We will move on.
And our family will no longer
have to suffer--
But somebody has to die.
Yes.
But not you.
Someone who's
not in my family.
Mom's dead.
Tell me.
What could be worse
than losing your own son?
Your wife?
All for what?
A big house?
Is that it?
Is that all
you care about?
You all were willing to
sacrifice your own sons
for a fucking Cadillac?
You disgust me.
Richie, Richie.
No. Richie.
Richie. Richie!
Wait!
It's okay.
Jim, it's okay.
It's okay, Jim.
Come on.
It's me.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on.
Come on.
No!
Goddamn it.
Come on. Come on.
Get up.
Get it done.
Come on.
Come on. Come on!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.
Come on.
No. No, no, no, no.
Me. Who? Me.
I've never thought
I'd win the Run.
No, I can't.
I'll do it!
You don't fucking
touch him.
No. No, no, no.
I'm sorry.
Well, I'll be...
Congratulations, kid.
Richie. Richie!
- Damn, Richie!
- I'll be taking that.
Richie's the winner!
Richie's the winner!
Richie's the winner!
Richie's the winner!
Richie's the winner!
Richie's the winner!
Richie's the winner!
Richie's the winner!
Richie's the winner!
Richie's the winner!
Richie's the winner!
Richie's the winner!
Ugh.
I gotta hand it to you.
I didn't think you
had it in you.
You're gonna be remembered
for a long, long time, Richie.
Future generations
of young boys with big dreams
will look up to you.
You're a hero.
Pack your
things and wait for me
at the crossing.
You wanna run away with me?
Say it.
I want to run away with you.
Where would we go? You and me?
Anywhere.
You just pick a place
in that little book
of yours and we'll go.
Anywhere you want.
They're gonna
come after us.
I know.
We probably won't
make it out.
Maybe not.
I won't stay here
any longer.
No.
Hold me.
Thanks
to your brave service,
we can now move
beyond the darkness
of this unfortunate night.
And move optimistically
into another long
and fruitful year
of peace,
prosperity,
and prize crops.
With you, Richie,
as our emissary
to the larger world,
riding high,
in a brand-new, shiny,
Corvette.
Take it for a spin.
Take me with you.
Please.
I'll do anything you want.
Richie, please.
There ain't no stop signs
on the black road.
Just doing
what has to be done.
What's always been done.
I've been hearing
that line of bullshit
from you all year long.
You got a backbone
all of a sudden?
I let one son down.
I'm not about to let
another one down.
Oh, boo-fucking-hoo, Dan.
Stand back.
All you had to do
was keep your kid
locked up for one
friggin' night.
One night!
But you couldn't even
manage that,
could you now?
I said stand back!
No, your piece of shit son
had to go and prove himself
and win the goddamn Run.
And now I have to put
the little fucker
into the ground.
Hey, you weren't followed?
Not yet.
Whoo!
Oh, Rich.
We're gonna make it.
Get down.
-Get down. Get down.
-Okay.
Shit!
What are we gonna do?
Hands up where
I can see 'em!
If I'm not back
in 10 minutes...
leave without me.
Richie, no.
Hands up.
Where I can see 'em!
Let me see 'em!
Whoo.
Walk towards me now.
Walk!
Slowly!
Slowly.
Slowly.
Huh?
Your old man
tried to save you.
Get your ass over there.
I said get it!
Go on. Move.
You know, you and me,
we never really did
get along, did we?
Hmm.
And yet,
in spite of it all...
I do respect you, Richie.
I ain't a hard guy.
And that's why this is going
to be especially hard--
You piece of shit.
It's over.
You killed my brother
and all those boys.
And for what?
I was just doing
-what had to be done.
-For who?
That's what's
always been done!
For who?
How does it even
fucking matter anymore?
Huh? Huh?
Please.
Please. Stop! Stop!
No.
No!
Go.
Get out of here, now.
Go on.
Please.
Before someone sees you.
Richie.
Please.
Fuck you,
and fuck this town.
Richie.
What are you doing?
Burn it down.
Burn it all down!
