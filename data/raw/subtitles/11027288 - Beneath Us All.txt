him in the woods,
so we have to take
care of him, okay?

I think he'll eat anything.

- I'm sorry, we should
have let you know sooner.
- Oh, it's fine, hey.
It's just the last time
that I saw the family,
they just seemed so-
- Rebecca, this
is not your fault.
There are some
families, some cases
that we, we just
can't help everyone.
Look, I had a thought.
I know this has been a
lot, and with the divorce-
- That has not affected my work.
- I know, I know.
I was just thinking
that it might be best
for everyone if we reassign
you to Oakland County.
- No, Mikaela, come on.
My caseload is full right now-
- Janet and Deb will take over.
(Rebecca sighs)
This is not a
punishment, Rebecca.
You are the brightest
social worker we have.
I'm just trying
to avoid burnout.
- Yeah.
- There are kids in the
boonies who need help, too.
(slow orchestral music)
(slow orchestral

(Rebecca sighs)

(birds chirping)
- Dumb kids, how is
this even a show?
(television chatters)
- [Janelle] Well, if
you hate it so much,
just change the channel.
- There's nothing else on.
Hey, hon, in a couple of
minutes I've gotta get going.
I've got some stuff I gotta do.
- What stuff now?
- It's not gonna take
long, don't wait up.
- You're kidding me, right?
I mean, we agreed not to-
- Relax, it's not like
I'm selling crystal.
Like I said, don't wait up.
- Right. (sighs)
(television chatters)
- [Julie] All right, guys.
(bird cheeps)
- [Erica] Aw, he's singing.
(bird cheeps)
- He does sound
better, doesn't he?
- Yeah, soon he could
get back to his family.
- I know, bud, his family.
(bird cheeps)
All right, we have
to put him away
for right now, okay, guys?

- So how long have you
guys been fostering kids?
- Well, it's, it's been
almost 15 years now.
- 15 years this spring,
but you already know that.
- I'm not interrogating
you, I'm just asking.
- Well, the doctor said
we couldn't on our own,
so we decided to open up our
home to kids in need, you see.
- We've had over 50 kids
come through this home.
God knows what
would have happened
to them if it wasn't for us.
- I'm sure they're
very grateful.
Now, with Julie.
- Julie is a very
emotional girl.
There was this incident
with an injured bird
and she didn't handle
that particularly well.
- How long was she gone before
you went looking for her?
- For crying out loud.
- Todd.
- No, I'm just saying,
she's old enough
to know not to run
away from home.
- Oh, an hour, maybe less.
I find she responds better
when she's given a
little time alone.
- But this time?
(slow orchestral music)
- She didn't come back.
- Look, I'm not here
to pester you guys
and dig into your home.
I just want to make
sure that Julie
and the other kids are
being taken care of.
- They are.
- And I'm sure that's the case.
In any regard, I would
love to speak with Julie.
(Rebecca knocks)
Julie?
My name's Rebecca and I'm
here to check up on you.
(door creaks)
(slow orchestral
music continues)
(slow orchestral
music continues)
I just want to know
why you were found
in the middle of the
road, did you get lost?
- I was just walking.
- Hmm.
Why didn't you
want to come home?
(slow music)
(slow music continues)
(slow dramatic music)
(birds chirping)
(birds continue chirping)
I'm sure everything's
gonna be fine.
The state is gonna
want to follow up soon,
but she seems like a bright,
sensible young woman.
I'm sure this was an
isolated incident.
- Thanks for coming out.
(slow orchestral music)
- Sure thing.
- We love Julie so much.
It makes us sick to wonder what
could have happened to her.
- I'm sure.
(slow orchestral
music continues)
(car engine revs)
(slow ominous music)
- [Stephen] It's me.
(Julie gasps)
- [Julie] You scared me.
- [Stephen] I didn't mean to.
- I know.
Come here.
- [Stephen] What's going on?
(slow orchestral music)
- It's hard to explain.
- You never tell me anything
that the grownups
are talking about.
- I do it to protect you.
- I'm getting older, it's
okay to tell me things.
- I'm your big sister.
You'll understand
with the little ones.
(slow orchestral
music continues)
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I was gone.
- Why didn't you come home?
- I don't know, there was
something in the woods.
There was this feeling,
like I was bringing
something bad back with me.
(slow ominous music)
(Julie sighs)
It's hard to explain.
I don't want you to worry, okay?
- I don't want you to leave.
- Me neither, me neither, buddy.

(slow rock music continues)
- [Manny] I was starting
to wonder where you'd gone.
- Yeah, well, it's been hard
getting away from the house.
- Old lady giving
you trouble at home?
- Kids.
- Ah, the wife and I,
we took a trip the day the
youngest moved out of the house.
The party hasn't stopped since.
So surely you didn't arrive
empty-handed, did you?
- No, it's all there,
you can count it.
- That's not necessary, I'm
sure you're good for it.
Besides, that table over
there needs another.
- Whoa, I can't believe it.
(poker chips rattling)
I'm sure you'll play well,
you're a lucky man, Todd.

(slow music)
(slow music continues)
(traffic roars)
- God.
- Whoa, where is the fire?
- I'm so sorry, I'm a
head case this morning.
I have two home visits and
another hearing this afternoon-
- Well, you might need
to push it back a bit.
Sarge is here.
- Here, as in here, here?
- As in, in your office.
- Shit.
- Oh, come on.
- It's exhausting having
to keep up with him.
- Get it out of the way and
go on with your day, trust me.
(Rebecca sighs)
- Ah, well, that's not bad.
(phone beeping)
- Hey, Sarge.
- Hey, Sarge, huh, people
still call me that?
Check this out, that
is the high score,
really, and my kid
just downloaded the
game for me last week
and I just beat his high score.
I can't wait to tell him.
- So what can I do
for you, Donovan?
- I'm just stopping
by, checking up.
I didn't see you at the funeral.
- Yeah, I had a case, I
couldn't really get away.
- Hmm, I see.
You burning your candle
on both sides of the
stick a little bit?
- What's that?
- You know what I mean.
It's important to know
when to remove yourself,
especially when it comes to-
- Burnout? Yeah.
- Burnout, yeah.
- Yeah, I've been hearing
about that a lot lately.
- See, that's why I like you.
I don't even think you're
the kind to burn out,
even if your boss tells you so.
That's not why I'm here, though.
I'm wrapping up my time
as detective in Oakland
and I got myself a
nice, cushy federal gig.
It's more crisis management,
not so much investigative,
but I wanted to
gauge your interests.
- For a job?
- Yeah, I mean, it would mean
relocating down the coast
to DC and the pay would
more than make up for it.
- I really don't even
know what to say.
- Don't say anything
at all just yet.
How about you, you spend
some time thinking about it,
kick it around a little
bit, and let me know.
The position isn't even mine
until the end of
the month, deal?
- Deal.
- [Donovan] Well, it
was good to see you.
- It was good to see you.
(birds chirping)
- Groceries.
(birds chirping)
(birds continue chirping)
(bags rustling)
Hey.
I need you to do a better job.
- With what?
- Cut the shit, you
know what I mean.
You're out of here in
a couple of months.
The rest, they're here to stay.
- Why don't you just adopt them?
If you did, the checks
would be stopped coming-
(Julie gasps)
- Goddammit, look
what you made me do.
Get the rest in the house.
(slow piano music)
(slow piano music continues)
- [Stephen] Are you okay?
- Yeah.
(slow piano music continues)
Stephen, what are you doing?
- I don't know, something,
something in the woods, I
can feel it, I'm afraid.
- Of what?
- I don't know, something.
- Well, I used to
be afraid of dogs.
- Dogs, why?
- Well, when I was your
age, I was bit by one.
She wanted the piece
of candy in my pocket
and it made me afraid of
dogs for a very long time.
- I like puppies.
(Julie laughs)
- Me too, me too, bud.
(slow piano music)
But
one day,
I decided I was going to
not be afraid anymore,
so I went to the
neighbors' house
and I faced my fear,
you understand?
(slow orchestral music)
You know,
sometimes
you have to face what is
making you feel so afraid.
It'll make you feel better.
(slow orchestral
music continues)
- What happened?
- With what?
- The, the dog, was she nice?
- Yeah, (sighs) she was.
She was nice.
But after that day, I
wasn't afraid anymore.
- I want to be brave.
(slow guitar music)
- We'll do it together, come on.
I have something to show you.
(slow guitar music continues)
(birds chirping)
Come on, let's go this way.
(slow rock music)
(poker chips rattling)
- Goddammit.
I fold.
- How goes it, Todd?
Maybe you have better
luck on the next hand.
- I just looked at the
time, I gotta get home.
- What's the rush?
Grab another drink,
take your time.
- I gotta go, I just-
- Listen, Todd, we both know
you owe the house
quite a bit now, okay?
And I know you don't have it.
If I let you walk out that
door, when are you gonna pay up?
Is it gonna be another
month before I see you?
- No, Manny, I just-
- I suggest you sit back down
and you play another round
with the fellas, okay?
(poker chips rattling)
(slow rock music continues)
(slow rock music continues)
(slow ambient music)
- I don't want to go in there.
- Don't worry, I won't let
anything happen to you.
Come on.
Hello?
You there?
- Can we go?
- Hold on, I think he's afraid.
- Please?
- I brought a friend
and some food.
(door rattles)
(slow ambient music continues)
It's not much, but at
least it's something.
(slow ominous music)
(wrappers rustling)
(slow ominous music continues)
You like it?
(Frey grunts)
- Does he have a name?
(Frey growls)
- Do you have a name?
Like, my name is Julie.
This is Stephen.
(Frey grunts)
- Frey.
- You can talk.
- I don't like it.
Where did he come from?
- I found him in the woods.
- [Stephen] I don't
like this thing.
- I know, little man,
I know, it's okay.
- Should we call Mom and Dad?
- No.
He's gonna stay
here for a while.
He doesn't like the sun,
so we can only
visit him at night.
And don't call them that.
Janelle and Todd
are not Mom and Dad.
(slow ominous music continues)
- Should we go?
- Go, we just got here.
(slow dramatic music)
Yeah.
We can go.
(slow dramatic music continues)
I'll be back, I promise.
(door rattles)
- Let's see, okay.
(pages rustling)
Oh my God.
Aged 17.
(slow orchestral music)
They want more kids?
(slow orchestral
music continues)
(slow orchestral
music continues)
- This is
new.
- I know this is unexpected,
but I just came here
to check on Julie.
(slow music)
How is she?
- Much better.
- That's good, that's good.
(birds chirping)
(slow music continues)
So what do you say?
- I don't really
have a choice, do I?
- I like to extend the courtesy.
(slow music continues)
- Julie!
(Julie slurps)
(upbeat radio music)
- Hey, you almost got it.
- That was good, I haven't
had a milkshake in forever.
- I feel like adults have
almost forgotten
how good these are.
- I'm not an adult,
not yet, anyway.
- That's true, but
17 is a fun age.
But it can be pretty tricky.
(Julie sighs)
So have you thought much about
what you're going to do next?
After your birthday, I mean.
- I don't know.
I haven't really thought
about it, to be honest.
- What about college?
- It's hard to figure all
that stuff out by myself.
- Yeah, I know, but that's
why I want to help you.
- With college, how?
- Applying, student loans.
People work and go to school.
There's even a great community
college right up the road.
- It's just, it's all so much.
- Yeah, you're right, but
that's why I want to help you,
because I feel like
nobody else is.
(television chatters)
- So what did you say?
- Nothing, she just wants
to help me when I turn 18.
- Yeah, hmm, we'll see.
(television chatters)
- [Speaker On TV]
Good night, baby.
Take care of her, Lieutenant.
- [Speaker On TV] I can
take care of myself.
- [Speaker On TV] She won't
be late, good night, Marshal.
- [Speaker On TV] Good
night, sir, uh, Sergeant.
- [Speaker On TV] Good night.

I feel much, much better.
Don't be afraid.
That's it.
(slow ominous music continues)
- Did something happen?
- [Frey] The more I feed,
the stronger I get.
- I, I could get you some food.
- That is not what I desire.
(slow ominous music continues)
I need fresher meat.
- I could go to the store,
I just need some time.
I'm gonna need some money.
- I need to hunt.
I need to feed.
I'm almost there on my own,
but I need your help.
(slow dramatic music)
I have no one else.
- Catalina. (clicks tongue)
Catalina, (clicks tongue)
where are you, kitty?
That's weird.
Catalina? (clicks tongue)
- [Officer] Animal attack?
(walkie talkie mumbles)
- I don't see what else.
I'll set up a

I'm not sure who's there
since Somerset retired.
- Yeah, I don't know either.
(walkie talkie mumbles)
We good?
- Yeah, it's just
not what I expected
from a last call, you know?

all be so lucky.

- I don't want these goons
coming here like last time.
(Janelle sighs)
Stephen, sit.
- [Stephen] I haven't seen her.
- She'll eat when she's ready.
- She's probably
outside chasing a mouse.
Circle of life, girls, dig in.
(silverware clinking)
You eating meat again?
Girls, you gotta grow up
to be like your big sister.
If you do, you'll grow
up big and strong.
(Frey whispers)
- I like meat.
- I like pizza better.
- You know what, I
like pizza better, too,
but that's not what
life's all about, is it?
We don't always get
what we really want.
(Frey whispers)
Sometimes you've gotta
eat your vegetables.
It's better for you than
pizza, more healthy.
- Put it down.
- It's just like
raising you kids.
It's hard opening your home
to a bunch of strangers.
Some kids come when
they're little,
some kids come when
they're bigger.
Everybody's different, you never
know what you're gonna get.
(Frey whispers)
But we have to do what
we know is healthy,
even though it's not
what we really want.
- You, you don't want us?
- Oh, Stephen, no, that's
not what your dad meant.
We just want you to take
these life lessons out
into the world with you
when you're done here
because we won't always
be there to protect you.
- You know, like Julie.
She's been a great role
model for you kids.
Pretty soon she won't
be here anymore.
- Where is she going?
- I don't want her to leave.
(Janelle laughs)
- Well, she's almost
all grown up now.
She needs a new place to live.
- Do we have to go, too?
- Oh, heavens, no, not
until you're much older,
but that's how it always is.
Someone leaves and
someone else comes.
(slow ominous music)
- I want you all to
remember Julie here.
She's been a great
example for you kids
in more ways than
one, thank you.
(Frey whispers)
You're going to college, right?
At least someone is.
- [Janelle] All right,
enough talk, let's just eat.
(Julie yelps)
(knife clatters)
- Jesus.
- You've gotta be more careful.
That could have cut someone.
- You got butter
on your fingers?
(slow ominous music)
(slow ominous music continues)
- May I please be excused?
- What have we just
been talking about?
Just eat your food.
(wolf howls)
(slow ambient music)
(door clicks)
- Where are you going?
- I'm
just going out.
- You're gonna see
him, aren't you?
(Julie sighs)
- It's fine.
- I don't think you
should go, he scares me.
- He's not bad, he just
looks kind of scary.
- He makes me feel bad,
like, in my stomach.
- You mean your gut.
- It doesn't matter,
he's trouble.
- He's hurt and I need to
help him, I'm all he has.
- We need your help, you
used to be there for us.
- I'm sorry, Stephen,
but I have to do this.
(slow ominous music)
- [Frey] You can't hide from me.
Yes, I'm here.
(faintly speaking)
(slow ominous music continues)
(slow ominous music continues)
- [Julie] Frey?
- [Frey] Thank
you for returning.
- Of course.
I brought something for you.
- Ah, ah.
This is not gonna
sustain me for very long.
- But I, I-
- I need, I need
better, fresher sustenance.
Otherwise, I'll die.
- You can't die.
(Frey sighs)
- I stay here
in this place,
then I surely will.
(slow ominous music continues)
(Frey sniffs)
My, my, my.
You're hurt.
- I cut myself.
- Let me see.

- [DJ] Hey, what's
up, everybody?
That's the newest track
from the band Sick,
titled "The King Must Die."
Awesome stuff, hope you like it.
Hey, heads up everyone in
Burton and Oakland counties,
a local couple was
recently killed
by what authorities are
calling an animal attack.
What kind of animal
killed two grown adults?
Well, whatever it is,
I know I don't want
to find myself face
to face with it.
Bring your dogs inside
and load those shotguns.
Anyway, here's the next track
from the band Take Back.
If you dig it, let us
know at BBZ's 554-2424.
(slow rock music)
(traffic hums)
(Donovan sighs)
(police radio mumbles)
(phone rings)
- So I take it you thought
some about my offer?
- I, I still have some
things to take care of.
- All right, just don't
leave me hanging forever.
- I heard about the animal
attack in Oakland County.
- Oh, yeah, I was on the scene.
That was a bloody mess.
- Was it a black bear?
- Well, what else?
- [Rebecca] Where did
it happen at exactly?
- It was Madison and 95,
just outside of town.
Why, what's up?
- Nothing, (sighs) I have a
family close by, the Gibbs.
They have small children.
- Yeah, they, they should
definitely stay inside.
- Yeah, I'm actually
heading there now,
so I'll make sure to
relay the message.
All right, talk soon.
- Hey, hey, Rebecca?
- [Rebecca] Yeah?
- I really do need to
know, you know, soon.
- I'll let you know
soon, I promise.
- [Donovan] All right,
well, you have a good day.
- Mm-hmm.
(slow ominous music)
(doorbell rings)
(birds chirping)
- What the hell, back again?
- I just came to drop
off some stuff for Julie,
college applications,
pamphlets, you know?
- Could have mailed them.
- It's no trouble stopping
by, I live pretty close.
- She's upstairs.
(slow ambient music)
(slow ambient music continues)
- Well, what do you
think about this?
(slow ambient music continues)
- I don't know.
(Rebecca sighs)
- Have you given
this much thought?
- No, not really.
- Okay.
I have a friend and she works
in the Admissions Department
at the local community college.
She's ready to meet with
you whenever you're ready.
(slow ambient music continues)
They even take early submissions
and you could start
in the winter.
- [Frey] Be together, you, you,
(slow dramatic music)
you and me.
- What if I don't want to go?
- That's okay, I mean,
there's plenty of jobs.
There's plenty of jobs out there
that don't require a degree.
Have you given much thought
about what you'd like to do?
- I'd rather stay here.
- Stay?
Well, your 18th
birthday is coming up,
and when that happens,
you're free to go
wherever you'd like.
- I want to be with the woods.
- Well, we will have to see
what we can do about that.
What has happened there?
- I hurt myself.
- How, I'm sorry,
let me take a look-
- No!
It's fine.
- [Rebecca] I'm sorry.
Would you pardon
me for a moment?
(slow ominous music)
(slow ominous music continues)
(television chatters)
- [Stephen] Ms. Rebecca?
- [Rebecca] Hey, buddy.
- [Stephen] There's
something wrong with Julie.
- [Rebecca] What do you mean?
- [Stephen] She met
a man in the woods.
- [Rebecca] A man?
- [Stephen] He's scary,
I don't like him.
(Janelle laughs)
- That's preposterous.
- Mrs. Gibbs, the
signs are all there.
(Janelle sighs)
- No, no, no, no.
Stephen has a wild imagination.
He loves scary stories, I
always see him reading them.
There is no man
living in the woods.
It is simply not true.
I don't know what
she said to him
to make him believe
that, but kids.
- You don't think that this
could be a cry for help?
- Oh, God, look, let me
put this bluntly. (sighs)
Julie has been with
us for three years now
and she has always
been difficult.
She's a smart kid and she
uses that to her advantage.
- Children often show
signs of acting out
when they've been abused.
- Are you saying that someone
in this house has
been touching her?
- Mrs. Gibbs-
- Look, we may not be perfect,
but neither my husband nor I
have ever touched that girl,
at least not in that way.
- I am just saying that maybe-
- I know what you
are just saying
and I think I want
you to leave now.
- I have been patient
with you, Mrs. Gibbs,
since the first day
that I walked in here,
but if you think that
you can force me out,
you are going to have a lot
of people poking around here,
whether you like it or not.
- Bye now.
(slow dramatic music)
(birds chirping)
(car door slams)
- [Sarah] You can't catch me!
- Girls, be careful out here.
You're paying attention
to that, right?
(birds chirping)
(birds continue chirping)
(car door slams)
(birds continue chirping)
Hey, you want to grab a beer?
(upbeat rock music)
(poker chips rattling)
(upbeat rock music)
- [Guard] Going
somewhere, let's go.
- It's time, Todd,
I need to collect.
- I'm trying, I just need
to wait 'til the
first of the month.
- Patience, my
patience has worn out.
- Get off.
- Shut the fuck up.
- Consider that a down payment.
I never, ever want to
see you in here again,
unless it's to pay
off your debt with me.
If I do, I'll blow your fucking
head off, you understand?
Good, get him out of here.
(birds chirping)
- [Erica] Fly, horsey, fly.
- A few minutes, girls.
- Okay.
- Want to trade?
- No.
I want to play
with the toy truck.
- No fair, I want to
play with the toy truck.
(Frey growls)
(bird caws)
- Maybe it's Catalina.
- [Sarah] Here, kitty, kitty.
- I don't like this,
I want to go home.
- Girls!
(Erica screams)
(funky radio music)
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Pull up a chair, stay a while.
- Great, well, hey, a Atwater
IPA if you've got it, thanks.
So what's up?
- Just dealing with a case.
You know that family, the
Gibbs, the one I told you about?
- Yeah, oh, thanks.
(funky radio music continues)
- I can't do it.
- You can't do what?
- I can't take the
job, I'm sorry.
- I see.
- I know the stats, I know
one day I will wake up
and I won't be able to get
myself to work, but geez,
after today, this girl,
she reminds me so
much of myself.
I was lost in the system
and I didn't have a shot.
Now she's showing signs of
abuse, and her brother is saying
that she's spending some time
with this man in the woods.
This family, they shouldn't have
even been granted foster
status in the first place.
On top of all of that,
they have three other
kids in the house.
I feel like I'd be
abandoning them.
- Yeah, but Rebecca,
you can't save everyone.
- I can try, I can do that.
I could try.
- I respect that, I
really do respect that.
- Thanks.
- You know what,
you're probably right.
You belong in the
field with the kids,
not in some stuffy
office in, you know,
wherever, DC, or-
(phone beeps)
- Well, they'd probably
be chasing me out
with torches and pitchforks.
What's that?
- Something happened
at the Gibbs's place.
(slow orchestral music)
- [Donovan] Erica?
- [Rebecca] Sarah?
- [Donovan] Sarah?
- [Rebecca] Sarah?
Erica?
- [Janelle] Sarah?
- [Donovan] Erica?
- [Rebecca] Where
are you, girls?
- [Donovan] Sarah?
(slow orchestral
music continues)
- Oh, God.
Oh, God, our Father
who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,
on earth as- (gasps)
Oh my God, oh my God.
- [Rebecca] Erica, Sarah?
- [Sheila] Oh, oh, God,
(cries) it's Sarah.
Oh, no, oh, no, darling girl.
(crying drowns out speaker)
- [Donovan] Dispatch,
we found them.
(slow ominous music)

(Frey whispers)
(slow dramatic music)
- You're saying this
isn't the first time?
- There was a couple
a few miles out
and it looked like it
could be the same animal.
(no audio)
- It would be a great
idea for you guys
and the children to
stay at a hotel tonight.
The state will provide, you
just need to pack a bag.
- I don't think so, the
kids are comfortable here.
- We don't want to
leave our house.
- Look, I understand,
it's difficult-
- You understand nothing.
This is all we have,
this is our safe space.
The world outside
took those babies.
If they had stayed at home,
they would have been safe.
- I'm sorry.
- The state will provide
counseling for the children.
If you two would like,
we can schedule something
for you, as well.
- We can't make them leave.
- No, I understand, though.
Well, again, (sighs)
I'm so sorry.
(slow orchestral music)
(slow orchestral

(slow orchestral

(slow orchestral

- Ms. Rebecca?
- You head to the car
and get it started, okay?
I'll be right there.
Oh, Stephen, I'm so sorry.
- I don't want to be here.
- I know you don't, but your
parents want you to stay.
- I don't care!
(car engine revs)
- How about this, how
about I come back tomorrow
and you and I can see
if we can talk to them
and maybe change their
mind, how does that sound?
Take it easy, okay, bud?
(slow ominous music)
(car engine revs)
(slow ominous music continues)
(Julie growls)
(slow dramatic music)
- We're never leaving, never.

- [Frey] Hello, my friend.
- Frey, Frey, did you?
- [Frey] I fed tonight.
I'm stronger than ever before.
- But, but those girls.
(Frey growls)
- We are fighting
for eternity, Julie.
(Frey growls)
With Sarah, I'll grow.
(slow ominous music continues)
Yes, we need one
more night to feed.
One more,
then we'll have all
the control we desire.
(Frey growls)
But I need your help. (growls)
I need several humans to
make our transformation,
healthy adults.
(dramatic choral music)
Can you bring them
together? (growls)
- My house?
- [Frey] Yes.
Your house.
Tomorrow we feed. (growls)
(dramatic choral

(Julie growls)
(Mikaela knocks)
- Hi, Rebecca.
- Hey.
- Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt your lunch.
- You didn't really
interrupt anything.
I'm not that hungry anyway.
- I want you to take a vacation.
- What, now?
- Yes, I talked with Donovan
and he told me about the job.
- So then he also told
you that I turned it down.
- Sure did, that doesn't mean
that I'm not worried about you.
If anything, this
makes it worse.
- Mikaela.
- Rebecca, I'm serious.
Just take an extra long
weekend, see your mom.
Go and get drunk at a bar.
Do whatever you need to do,
but I just need to make sure
that you are taking
some time for yourself.
- Fine.
- Good, I'll redistribute
your caseload this afternoon.
Get out of here.
(Rebecca scoffs)
(phone rings)
(Rebecca sighs)
- Oh, man.
(upbeat radio music)
- That bag was full of potatoes.
- Oh my God. (laughs)
- There you go.
- Thanks, man.
I don't even, it was
the craziest thing.
- Oh my gosh. (laughs)
(phone rings)
Okay, hello?

- [Julie] Hi.
- Oh, oh, gosh, one second.
(upbeat radio music continues)
- Hey, this is Rebecca,
may I ask who's calling?
- [Julie] This is Julie.
- Julie, I wasn't
expecting to hear from you.
Is everything okay?
- [Julie] It's Janelle,
something is wrong.
She's having a breakdown.
(slow ominous music)
Please help.

better get out of here.

- Oh, I don't know, (growls)
I think we're gonna

comfortable right here.
(slow dramatic music)
(Julie growls)
(Janelle gasps)
- Julie?
(Julie growls)
Who did this to you?
- What do you mean, you did.

so you must die.

Look, Julie.
I know you, okay?
You're a good person.
