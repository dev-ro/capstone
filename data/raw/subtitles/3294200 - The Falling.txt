And those are not regulation.
Stop your clowning!
It'll get you nowhere, Abigail Mortimer.

An egg is a cell.
It has a nucleus and a membrane.
When the yolk matures,
the follicular sac ruptures.
If any blood vessels cross the stigma,
a small drop of blood may get on the yolk
as it's released from the follicle.
It's what causes most blood spots in eggs.
Egg first or chicken, Mr Hopkins?
The egg's still a mystery to scientists.
It's complex.
It's a tiny centre of life.
LYDIA: And then she's like...

No, I don't think so, Mrs Lamont.
Oh, come on!

Thanks, Abbie. You're an angel.

Let's do some magick,

I could do a spell.

When's that ever worked, hmm?
KENNETH: You know,

A talented and popular pupil

who was energetic.
And dependable.
Her passing is a true loss to us all.
She will be remembered as a loyal friend
who enjoyed art and reading poetry
and as the founder
of the alternative school orchestra.
Abbie's life was full and happy

Is there any friend in particular

So, who was the first person

If you don't want to
talk about it, just say.
Any history of illness in the family?
My cousin, she has fits.
Have you witnessed a seizure?
When you first noticed your symptoms,
had anything happened?
Exams?
An illness around you? A death?
If I were a fly on the wall in your house,
what would I see, Janet?
Just... Like a normal family.
Normal like normal.
PSYCHIATRIST: Your teachers,
what are they like?
Well...
Miss Alvaro, she wouldn't care
if we were all dead.
And Miss Mantel,
she's a malicious prude.
I like
Miss Charron.
LYDIA: She's been sick, too.
PSYCHIATRIST: She's close in age to you?
That's important, isn't it?
I think so, too.
PSYCHIATRIST: Have you had
sexual intercourse?
Yeah.
No.
I can't really remember.
Your mother? Well, is she?
I haven't caught anything off her,
if that's what you mean.
Do you like the attention you get
from your mother when you faint?
I hate it if she gets concerned about me.
Have you had your first
sexual experience, Lydia?
LYDIA: I don't do things like that.
PSYCHIATRIST: Could you expand?
I don't put dates on things.
You know, I read
that one person is really

The person you think you are,
the person other people see,
and the person you really are.
You're a bright girl, aren't you?
Don't patronise me.
Is that what you think I'm doing?
I don't know what you're doing.
If anything.
I'm...
I'm not...

I'm not.
PSYCHIATRIST: Your father?
I don't know him.
She drove him away.
She squeezes the life out of everybody.

Do you ask everyone that?
Just female patients, of course.
It's important to have

No one wants the truth, do they?
That does make me angry. Write that down.
I think there's quite a lot going on
under that anger.
It's racing.
It's like it's gonna jump out.
I resent this idea that
we're just emotional.
This is real.
It's real in its consequences, yes.
What's important here is

Real to me? What does that mean?
It's real to all of us.
Something's seriously wrong.
Why is everyone ignoring us?

LYDIA: They don't seem

My advice?
Don't take the pills.
And try and hide your symptoms.
I'm finding,
being in the more advanced stages,
that my symptoms
don't show as much anyway.
- The advanced stages?
- Yeah, Connie.
Being further along, I'm ahead.
You just can't stand
that we're all feeling ill, too.
No! I'm glad you're ill.
Well, no, not glad, but
you know what I mean.
I'm gonna get my parents to arrange
for us to see a leading medical specialist.

- Susie.
Come on!
I'm not gonna let you down.
Hysterical contagion, that's the diagnosis.

MISS MANTEL:
Standards of behaviour must be kept.
This is a school, it's not a
mental institution.
This generation,
they think they're so misunderstood.
If they had any idea what it's like
to be a middle-aged woman,
they'd know what misunderstood meant.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

Sounds to me
like they didn't find anything wrong.
The tests weren't advanced enough.
You didn't go mentioning me to them,
did you?
The world doesn't revolve
around you, Eileen.
You know, I'm supposed to go
and see another psychiatrist.
I don't think you'll have much choice
but to come.
They'll ask lots of probing questions
about you, you know.
They're very interested
in exactly why I am like I am.
Have you got any idea what it's like
having you as a mother?
It's so unfair! I never
asked to be born to you!
Get away from me!

KENNETH: Wow.
What's Crazy Face gone and done now?
(DOOR CLOSES)
You know, I'm definitely
in the advanced stages, too.
That specialist of yours
will just put it down to female hormones.
I mean, it could be all kinds of things.
For all sorts of reasons.
Tastes metallic.
You're nothing like her, you know.
You've never actually cried for Abbie,
have you?
Anyway, I've not come to see you.
I came to see Kenneth.
Kenneth.
We've started seeing each other now.
You know, we've got a real thing.
I requested to see you, Lydia, because...
You never liked her, did you?
Excuse me?
Her name's Abbie.
As much as I'd like
to take a close interest in every pupil...
Are you going to tell me
exactly what's going on?
Are you?
- You're afraid of me.
- (SCOFFS)
You're merely a girl.
- What are you writing?
- It's nothing.
It's about me.
You go around in that thing.
You're so...
You're so...
The school secretary is personally
visiting your mother this morning
to deliver the news.
It is for the best, Lydia.
It is with regret that I must inform you...
You can't.
You can't get rid of me. I have rights.
MISS ALVARO: So we thank you,
Miss Charron,
for your invaluable contribution
in recent years
and give you good wishes for the future.
And finally, in response to recent events,
I wish to clarify
that absolutely nothing
has been found in any tests
on the school or on the pupils.
We have a reassuringly
clean bill of health.
Anyone that says otherwise
is wilfully wrong.
You'll never get rid of me.
I will not tolerate such
conduct in this school.
- You all know something is wrong.
- Get her out.
Are you not gonna fight for the truth?
What have you been reduced to?
- MISS ALVARO: Prefects, get her out.
- Inertia?
You're all asleep.
To be free you must be conscious.
Kill the system. It's killing you!

(SOBBING) Abbie.
Lydia?
You really should leave.
To be free you must be conscious.
Why does everyone want to get rid of me?
Get off me.
There's something here.
I can feel it.
Something so poisoned, so wrong.
Lock the door.
Stop it.
- What have I done to you all?
- Done? You haven't done anything.
He should have kept me in the hospital.
I'm mad, I'm crazy.
You are not crazy, Lydia.
You are not crazy, you're not mad.
We're normal.
If it's real to me...
I made it up.
I've never really been ill. (SNIFFLES)
SUSAN: What? What about us?
- We've all had it, Lydia.
- I've not.
We've all got it.
Nobody can just faint.
I guess I started it.
Well, it happened to me very early
and I can assure you I'm no faker.
I'm... I'm not a copycat.
All of the tests were negative.
And how come
the others recovered so quickly?
That psychiatrist said
if it was real to me...
- I don't think it is.
- You know what, Lydia?
You're the fake.
(THUMPS WALL)
Everything's wrong.

- LYDIA: So...
- (DOOR CLOSES)

...I'm expelled.
Good for you.
Teenagers!

Get off!
Get away from her!
Go on, you get the hell away!
Get out of my house! Get out!
- Stop it!
- Get off me!
Go on, get out of my house!
Go on!
Stop looking at her, I mean it!
You disgust me.
You ought to be locked up.
You're dangerous.
I...
I forgot he was my brother.
(SCOFFS) You forgot?
Oh, you've not been ill,
but you are sick and
you're sick in the head.
There's not a man to be trusted.
I know he went and left you,
but you must have trusted him once.
- I mean, you had two kids with him.
- One.
Two. There's me, remember?
- One.
- Two!
- I can count.
- (SCOFFS)
What?
You're not his.
(SCOFFS)
That's why he ran away.
Whose am I?
- Forget it, it's history.
- It's my history.
Who is he? Is he still alive?
Oh, come on, you've got to tell me!
Well, was there...
Is there something wrong with him?
There was, wasn't there?
What's wrong with me? Who am I?
He came from the shadows.
What?
And then he...
He...
You mean...
You were...
You were...
I'm...
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHS)
And I look like him, don't I?
I've grown up
looking like him.
(SIGHS)
I always knew something was wrong.
Now I know.
It was me. It's always been me.
- I should never have said.
- I'm glad I know the truth.

Let's meet underneath it the same day
every year for the rest of our lives.
The time has come...
Abbie!
Abbie!
Abbie!
Abbie!
I feel so free!
Lydia?
Lydia, sweetie, please come down.
Look at me, Mum! Look at me! Watch me!
Watch me! Watch me!
- No, sweetie, please! Just come down.
- Abbie!
Lydia, please. Come down.
We could go to the seaside.
(LAUGHING)
That'd be nice.
We've never been to the seaside.
I feel so real.
I feel so awake, free!
So conscious.
Lydia.
Abbie!
