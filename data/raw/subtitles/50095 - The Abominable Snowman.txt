The Abominable Snowman.
Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha
Have you seen this specimen, Foxy?
Yes, it's a variety of
Meconopsis Napaulensis.
It's an uncatalogued variety.
Dr. Rollason, here's the refreshment.
-Oh, that's kind of you.
- Are you too absorbed
in what I've shown you?
- Absorbed indeed, sir.
- Me, too, sir
I thought I knew every type of plant
in these mountains. But these?
These plants will be employed
to cure sickness of the skin.
And where does it grow?
The monks go in parties
to seek all these plants.
They take many days.
- Can they show me?
Now is not the time. Soon a
heavy snowstorm will come.
And the valleys will be dangerous.
- Oh.
Take what is there. Take what you need.
But these are four medicines.
We have a great stash
of all these herbs.
-You can really spear them?
Take what you wish, now, so will have
every spec...
- Species?
- Species.
It's a long time since
I have studied your language.
The Research Foundation
will be greatly in your debt, sir.
Mr. Fox, you do not drink your tea?
-Oh, I do, well, I mean I will.
I think I'm going to like some
jars to put these in.
-It will be cold.
-Well, really, I quite like it cold.
Excuse me.
Mr. Fox doesn't enjoy
tea made in our fashion.
To him I think it still seems
a bit greasy and unpleasant.
- But you?
- I've come to enjoy it.
- And your wife?
She also enjoys it?
-Well, she's working on it.
- Well, she's a brave person
to come here at all.
She can't be comforted in
those poor quarters I have provided..
This is a hard, rough place built for men.
-You've been very good to us, sir.
-Tell me, Dr. Rollason...
You are content with this land,
these people, our customs?
-I think so.
I know the Himalayans very well
through climbing and now this work.
- You're a climber,
to the great peaks.
-I was.
But I had an accident, a stupid one,
but a bad one, so I gave it up.
And now your wife comes with you
to make sure of that?
- Helen comes with me as a colleague.
We work together.
And the other party, who's coming,
How long have you waited?
-They are six days overdue.
- Your wife, Dr. Rollison,
she knows they're coming?
Coming to help you with your work?
-Of course.
But there will be little left to do,
now that your work is almost completed.
-They'll want to see things for themselves.
You permit?
These other men were also sent by
your foundation, or are they not?
They're not.
-Do you know something about them?
-I know they will be here tonight.
I have sent guides to meet them.
You're not pleased?
Of course, this is wonderful news,
but I had no idea they'd been see.
- They have not been seen, but
they will be here in a few hours.
-Helen.
- Yes?
- Specimen jars.
The old boy's just made us a present.
A pick of his
collection of dried plants.
-That's wonderful, Foxy. Does John know?
Well, he's over there
now, waiting for jars.
-And why this sudden generosity.
- I do not know.
They've got to get rid of us.
And so I'm ready... the
sooner we get out of here,
out of this infernal country
with its cold and bad smell,
And the superstitions...
- Take it easy, Foxy, take it easy.
From the misery and ignorance,
and this awful, cold,
-And the Tibetan tea.
- Say, are you busy?
- Just a few diagrams to finish, why?
Will you be an angel and take these
over to John for me, will you?
Yes.
- now I can get on with the re
indexing of the new specimen.
- Here it is.
- Foxy?
- I have another arm.
- Of course. Sorry.
I hope that I can get a few
more details about these.
The possible elevation
in which they can be found...
- Dr. Rollason, what do you know
about those men that are coming?
-Know about them?
Not very much. I have a message from them
suggesting we meet here.
- From their leader, a man named
Friend?
- That's right, Tom Friend.
You've heard of him?
- He passed these ways
before some months ago.
But he did not come to
me, as is his custom,
- Perhaps he did
not wish to pester you.
-And now he returns.
What is this man searching for?
- Before I can say that,
I must have a talk to him.
-You can say now.
Dr. Rollason, why do you
want to help these people?
I suppose for the pursuit of knowledge.
-Whose knowledge? Yours alone?
-All of human knowledge.
-Human knowledge?
Is that reason enough?
I'm afraid we're taking your time, sir.
I don't know what's happened to Fox.
-He is not coming. She is.
Your wife. She's approaching now.
- But how do you know?
- I've been hearing.
-Is that all, sir?
Here I have developed
the senses. All of them.
There's time for the
learners of many things.
Have you not found it so?
Come in. You're welcome, my dear lady.
- Thank you.
- Foxy told me to bring you this.
- Oh, yes thank you. We have been presented
with some remarkable new specimen.
- I know, Foxy told me.
-We have not met many times, Mrs. Rollason.
-No, no we haven't.
I was talking a lot to your husband,
but not to you.
I'm sorry, I've had quite
a lot of work to do.
I have been concerned for your comfort
but your husband reassured me.
- Of course. I bet we put you
to a lot of inconvenience.
- You are welcome to remain
under my protection
while her husband is
on his climbing expedition.
- Climbing?
- To the peaks.
Now, unfortunately my duties
make this meeting all so short and...
I must leave you now.
- What climbing expedition, John?
- That was deliberate.
I guess I hadn't told.
- Why don't you tell me now?
Helen, I was going to explain to you
before, but they may not have turned up.
-They?
-It's a party led by a man named Friend.
They should be here in a few hours.
- And you have arranged to go with them?
-Provisionally.
Oh, Helen, please, please.
There was no point in talking about
it before. I haven't even told Foxy.
- Thanks, it's nice to
be back to "Together".
- You know I didn't mean that,.
- What about the Botanical Foundation?
Have you kept them in the dark, too? - This
has nothing to do with the Foundation.
Only that they financed this year
and they are waiting for our report...
And we are already behind schedule.
- Yes, I know that.
Without it being all about loyalty,
Don't you think we ought to get on with it?
- Helen, please
try and understand.
-I am trying.
But at this time of year
with the fresh snow
falling to go peak
climbing, just to...
-But they might not even arrive.
- Why did we come up here, John?
- Why?
-Right up here so out of the way?
It wasn't just to search
for rare plants, was it?
Was it, John?
- No - I've had my eye on you.
I kept remembering the
things you wrote once.
But I said nothing. I didn’t want
to remind you. - What I wrote?
-I'd hoped you'd forgotten.
- Your theories about the high valleys,
about what might be there...
- Listen, darling. You're
getting upset about
something that might
not even happen.
- I don't want anything to do with it.
I can't bear it, John!
I don't want you to get into danger.
Into the mountains to
look for this creature.
What's all this event of?
Oh, it's just one of
their regular ceremonies.
- You think they've chosen
tonight on purpose?
- Maybe.
- Hey, come inside and shut the door.
How do you expect to have anything
hot if the wall's hot?
How's it coning?
I think it may be
enough for an extra four.
-Maybe even more!
- Hey, you're not going to ask me
to feed his porters, too, are you?
- It will be an awful waste
of food if they don't.
-You know something, Foxy?
Nothing would give me more
pleasure than to have to waste it.
-They're here.
-Let me know how many.
- You the head man here
Do you speak English?
Where is our guide? Hey, Kusang!
-He's bringing up the rear.
Do you know Dr. Rollason?
- Rollason!
-Tom Friend.
-Oh hi.
- Hey, Kusang!
- I'm here, Mister.
- Get the storage under
cover, take care of the ponies.
- Is this in our honor?
- I don't know.
- Hey Jock, stick close.
These guys eat you.
Mr. Friend, I am
very glad to meet you.
Mr. Rollason, I presume.
It's a great honor.
- What was giving you up?
- We ran into a little bit of bad weather.
- We happen to think that you've been gone.
- This is Ed Shelley.
Mr. Shelley. - Hi.
-Jock, our photographer.
- How do you do?
- And this is Peter Fox, my assistant.
- I hope you're all hungry.
There is a banquet upstairs.
- Beef stew.
Leave me to it, I could eat a yak.
- I'd better warn you
about Ed's table manners.
- Oh, and this is my wife Helen.
Tom Friend, Mr. Shelley and Andrew...
Andrew McNee. -Sorry.
- How do you do? I have four
portions between the three of you,
so come on up everybody.
-I take your word, ma'am.
Come on, Jock.
This is home cooking.
- You didn't tell me about your wife.
- We always work together.
Hardly a trip for a woman.
No, she stays here with
Fox, I already fixed that.
- Fine.
- If I come.
-If you come?
Dr. Rollason, this is the... this is the
expedition that's not gonna fail.
We're gonna find that
creature they call the Yeti.
No.
Yes.
Can we stable under there,
under your living corners.
-I told you it was built for.
-Kusang!
- We covered a lot of
miles today. How many, Tom?
- About ten...
- Ten?! My feet said about a hundred.
I rolled the rockiest tracks
in this stinking country.
Thank you.
- Ed here objects to the primitive.
- Come on, move over.
-Primitive?
I don't know what's worse about it,
The stink of everything.
Or the ignorant natives,
or the filthy food they eat or what.
You tell me.
- I find this country attractive.
- Attractive?
-Oh, come on, Ed, knock it off, will you?
- Oh, even what we'll
look for is abominable.
That's what they call it, isn't it?
The abominable snowman?
- It doesn't exist.
- Helen.
You don't subscribe to your
husband's theories, Mrs. Rollason?
- No.
- And about what this creature might be?
- No, I don't.
- Neither do I.
-Well, skeptics right in camp back here.
When the whole evidence there is
based on a few footprints in the snow.
Have you ever seen
these footprints, Mr. Fox?
-I have not.
-I have.
-Where?
In Drolambao glacier.
With a climbing party, two yeas ago.
I found a line of... fresh footprints
like human ones, only
bigger and far broader.
-You didn't see what made it?
I followed them for a mile or so and then
they finished in a bare rock face.
It was... it was just long enough to get
a sense of what I might be tracking.
- You are an impressionable man,
Mr. McNee.
Well, this is a sort of impression
you won't forget.
- Alson, there have been
photographs, Mrs. Rollason.
1951 Shipton expedition took
pictures of similar footprints.
They were published by the Times.
- They could be made by a bear.
-But they weren't.
- Look, in your message, you said
something about having special evidence.
So this seems like a
good time to produce it.
- This came into my
possession a short time ago.
Solid silver.
Native craftsmanship.
If you can see what it says
around there, translate it.
-The protection of the great...
No, something like... powerful...
The powerful beings is besought.
At the land of Rong-ruk.
- This monastery?
- That's right.
It was stolen from here some years ago
by a German explorer.
The powerful beings
probably means local gods.
-Now watch.
The ornamentation hides the join, but
it finally does unscrew and you see.
-A tooth!
In the Middle Ages it was a usual thing
to preserve bits tooth and
bones in the bodies of saints.
That's what that is.
A relic. Of course you know
more about that, Doctor.
-It's unbelievable.
The size of it!
- It seems to be genuine.
- It is. I had it sectioned and tested.
- It's like the canine tooth
of an ape, a gorilla.
- Yes, but it's about three times as big.
- Let me see.
- I read your views, doctor,
about the possible
size and bone structure
of these creatures.
- That would fit, wouldn't it?
- Yes, it would, but it's not a fossil.
-It's living ivory.
-What is this, a war dance?
- These people are Buddhists,
they don't believe in war.
- Holy men doing a holy dance. Hey,
this is good. Jock, take a picture.
-They don't allow it.
- Are you sure they don't mean trouble?
- You can take my word for it.
-Well, I hope you're right.
I got no responsibility over
where my porters' lives are.
- Their religion prevents them
from harming anyone or anything.
- Okay, just so they know it.
How about some more stew?
- Just a minute, did I hear right?
You're not taking the porters with you?
- Not beyond this point.
- You're doing this climb alone?
- Yes, just the five of us.
- You're mad.
-You better tell your plan.
Well, so far no expedition ever got
even near this thing they call a Yeti.
You know why?
Because they were tramping
up the peaks with 50,
or 60 porters behind them
like an invading army.
It's enough to scare any living creature.
We don't want that.
So it will be just the five of us.
- On what do we live? On vitamin pills?
-Tell him Tom.
- We've been up here before,
Ed and I, last summer.
-Yes, I heard that.
- Took fifty men loaded up to the
limit up to the north valley.
Saw to the way supplies
and stored them in
places where they would
be safe from the snow/.
Rock caves and so on,
all on the route.
- And you think these
supplies will still be there
with fifty men sharing this secret?
- They don't. We took turns.
One of them marched them on while the
others stayed behind and hid the
the batch that they had just unloaded.
Single handed. It was
murder, but we did it.
-The north valley.
- It's the steepest and crookedest and
blocked by the worst ice you've ever seen.
-like the mountains of the moon!
If I were a creature who wanted to lurk
away from humanity, that's where I'd lurk.
- John, this is completely irresponsible.
Without porter and without a guide.
- Correction, ma'am, we're
taking along one local guide.
Kusang, you saw him down below.
- One Guide. And how did he
qualify for this unique position?
-Because he's seen a Yeti, ma'am.
-He's seen one?
-This is the time to do it, doc. Winter.
The heavy snow's forced
anything up that valley down for food.
- Yes, but...
- It's gonna be tough going, we know that.
We're gonna need an expert climber.
And a double capacity.
We need you with us. What to you say, doc?
-Yes, John, what do you say?
- Id like to show this to someone first.
- Who's that?
- The person who seems to be its
rightful owner. The Lhama.
- Whenever you say.
- Now.
- Keep the food hot.
- I'll come, too.
- How long is this war?
- Sometimes for several hours.
-Put that away, John.
-Yes, I know this.
It was taken from here many years ago.
However you came by it, Mr.
Friend I'm grateful.
You return it now.
I happen to do so, sir.
You... you know it opens, then?
-The carved tooth.
-Carved?
It was made according to what I heard
by monks a far distant time.
It was meant to be a tooth
the god Manjushri, the all powerful.
-Made?
Did you think it was a real tooth?
- We thought perhaps it was.....
- You men of the west.
You are driven by curiosity.
You would risk your lives in the rains
and ice and coldness to search for this...
- "Animal".
- He's known all the time.
-This animal you only imagine to exist.
-You also think it doesn't exist?
Dr. Rollason, you've made no contract.
You are under no obligation
to go up there with us tomorrow.
But we're going.
And if it's humanly possible,
will find this creature.
-I'll come.
-Don't worry. He'll be alright.
We'll look after him, he'll be just...
I have my party and myself, but
thank you for your hospitality.
-Small return, Mr. Friend, for this.
Okay, emergencies knapsacks
pack and checked.
- What's next?
- Climbing irons.
Kusang's getting them.
Kusang, where are you?
Watch these guys.
They got a greedy look.
- I do not think...
- Just watch them, that's all.
Come on. Give me that.
Hey Kusang, did you talk
to the other porters?
Yes, mister. They want pay now.
They'll get paid
when we get back.
- How come we only got three packs?
- Rollason says he's got his own gear.
- Goodbye Foxy. Look after her.
- I will.
- See you soon.
-Well, I better get back to that report.
-Foxy disapproves.
You'd Better bring us together again.
- I thought we said...
- I know, John.
But it's those men, Friend and Shelley,
I don't trust them, I don't like them.
- You're doing storm in a glass of water.
- No, I feel it, John.
Listen, Friend talks too much, agreed,
and Shelley could use a few manners...
- I snore. They will be the ones to suffer.
- Don't joke about it, John.
- Helen, darling,
Look, you do understand.
I've written and talked enough about it.
And now I've got the chance to put it all
to the test. I have to take it, haven't I?
Come on, now, give me a hand with this.
John, for the last time
I’m asking you, don't go.
-Look, darling...
You won't come back, I know it.
I'll never see you again.
Hey Doc! Kusang!
Come on, we got to move.
- Be careful, my darling.
Be careful.
- I can take look after myself.
You know that.
Rollason!
Kusang! Let's go!
Hey Tom, wait a minute.
We've got to keep this pace up?
We've got to make that hut
before nightfall.
We went an easier way
last time, over those ridges.
-This time of year, they're all snowed up.
- Yeah? Look at those guys.
They seem to be doing alright.
Yeah, well, they're not
going where we're going.
- You all right, Doc?
- So far.
-Well, let's keep moving. Nice and steady.
Get a rhythm, maybe you ought
to sing her something.
Yeah, you do that. Sing!
♫ John Brown's Body... ♫
-Oh, come on. Sing.
- Save your breaths, will you?
- We're making good time, ain't we?
-Yeah, but wait until we start to climb.
- Come on, Ed. We got to keep this pace up.
-Why pick on me? What about limp foot?
- Well, him I can do without,
You I need.
- Stop bickering, We've got
less than two hours till
sunset. We've got to be in
a safe campsite by then.
-When we get to
the hut, we'll be all right.
-Where exactly is this hut?
-Over that ridge.
-There's another rough weather coming up,
we'll never make it in time, unless...
- There is a shortcut.
- Where?
- Across the column, on that side.
- It looks awfully steep.
-Oh, let's give it a try.
You're the prized climber in this
party, Doc. Why don't you take over?
-Alright, everybody wrap up immediately.
Kusang rope.
- It will be a short, sharp climb.
- So long as it's short.
-Fairly short, it will be easy as hell. You
will be in minimum positions for safety.
-I like safety, too, Doc.
-We'll be alright if we keep
our minds in what we're doing.
-Alright, let's get roped
up and get on with it.
- Kusang, you first.
-How's it going, Doc? Come on, Ed.
-Ok, we're coming!
Hey, Jock.
Spread out.
Don't crowd 'em!
Avalanche!
What happened? -Uh, nothing. Just
some little stuff came down.
For a minute there, I thought
we had an avalanche starting.
-And It might have been it,
with him yelling like that.
- You're crazy!
- No, he isn't.
A sharp sound, a sudden
vibration is all it takes..
Let's have no more
shouting unless it's vital.
Right, You got that, Ed?
- Okay, okay.
- Come on, let's go.
-There it is, the hut.
-Oh, there's nothing else  here, Tom.
It was all sealed in these containers.
- Fill the hole up again.
- Fill it up?
They will be up this spring and will think
that the earth devils have been here.
-Go ahead and fill it
up, or want to scare do
you want to scare these
poor natives to death?
- You are a civilized man.
- Alright, tomorrow.
If this is the way you planned the rest
of our trip a caution is out of the call.
-You wouldn't get a meal like
this out of an emergency pack.
- Who's for more?
- Not for me, thanks.
I thought altitude was
supposed to make you hungry.
Kusang!
-You talk about this as if it were a joke.
-Have you seriously
considered what might happen?
-Look, Doc, I've been running
into people all my life
Who'd cried off because
of what might happen "if".
I went ahead and did it.
Now for some facts: I've got some
real supplies cashed up ahead.
This was just a snack on the way up.
-What else have you
 got cashed away besides food?
-Everything we need, from tents, to fuel.
Look, 18, 000 feet.
We'll stop, make our first camp,
and search at the foot of the ice wall.
20,000 feet the same procedure,
and then again at 22,000.
And we've got oxygen if
 we want to go higher.
We've got everything we need
to get up above above this creature.
Search it out in its own
ground and track it down.
Now, how about some
more of your contribution?
- Oh, such as?
- Expert advice.
Let's know the nature of the enemy.
What's it live on?
Of small animals. Hares, mice, those.
But we've seen none.
We don't see them, but
he's right, they’re there
- Carnivorous, then, huh?
- No, they needn't be.
There are roots and plants under the snow.
It's probably adaptable like man.
-Man? What you're
suggesting roughly is that
this may be some kind
of a missing link?
-That's a bit too rough.
Say parallel development.
-Not with you.
-Parallel with mankind?
-We are not far
north of India.
Now, some millions of years that was a
breeding ground of huge ape-like animals.
Primitive anthropoids, their possible
bones are dug up from time to time.
Now, the latest evolutionary theory is
The very same has
branched off in two directions,
One to become the great apes,
chimpanzees, orangutan, and so on,
And the other man.
-Darwin's theory all tidied up. So?
Will, suppose...
Suppose there were
a third line of descent.
-The Anthropoid X.
As different from man as the apes are.
-Probably.
-This calls for very fancy guesswork.
But what would have happened to them?
-Gradual extinction through
change of conditions and enemies.
-Might include both apes and men,
-Most likely it did,
though only a remnant survived.
Adapting themselves to living where
nothing else would. In these mountains.
The highest in the world,
and above the snow line.
-There's no proof of all this.
-Oh, not yet, but a hundred
years ago there was no
proof that primitive men
had ever existed, either.
-Look, how do you see it? I
mean, it walks on two legs.
-There's no doubt
 about that. The tracks prove it.
They show a foot 13 inches
30 cm long and very wide indeed.
The stride of a six foot man,
yet his legs would be far more massive
and short in proportion to his height.
-Now, you see what that implies?
- It's big.
Perhaps 7 or 8 feet high?
- What do you think, Ed?
-You know, can try.
- Go on, drag it out. Good a time as any.
- I'm not with you.
-Oh, me might as
well let you in our little secret.
The fact of the matter is that
Ed here is an expert trapper.
-Yeah, everything from
foxes to grizzlies.
Now, this is a tungsten steel net,
it's just a little sample.
-Do you think it will hold it?
-Oh, if not, we have
 other things up there.
-What things? More guns?
-So that's what this is.
A hunting party.
-Well, what did you expect us to do?
Look at it through a telescope?
And Jock here take a picture?
You said this was a
research party investigation.
It is, bonafide, and I want one
alive, and so do you.
- And what is your interest, commercial?
- And if they are, they're ours/
-Then why all the secrecy?
-For a thing just like this.
Outraged indignation.
- I wanted to be well under away before...
-Listen...
- Listen!
- What is it?
-I was certain I heard something, but
you were talking so loudly.
- Outside?
- What?
-A sort of cry.
- You see anything?
- Keep your voices down.
- Over there. Snow man mark.
- Are you sure?
Quiet!
- No, it's nothing.
- But I'm sure I heard something.
-Any the rest of you heard anything?
- Kusang?
- No, no...
It's false alarm.
-Jock, you need some sleep.
We all do. Come on..
I'm sorry I broke out
at you like that just now.
-We're all a bit on edge.
may be the altitude.
-Yeah, but I think I ought to explain.
Frankly I'm here as
a commercial venture, but
I don't think that
cheapens my motives in any
way. - And what's at
the end of the line?
- A circus? A zoo?
- No, neither.
Thanks.
- Look.
I'm not exactly a golden character, Doc.
After the war I did a little smuggling
around on the coast of Europe.
hard gun for the angry little countries.
I lived on the two basic drives of
humanity: Fear and hunger.
When they began to dry up on me,
I looked around for another one.
On curiosity,
human curiosity.
Funny thing. Ever think about it?
-I suppose I suffered under it.
The world is full
receptive, inquisitive people...
People who are informed,
responsive to new ideas.
The radio and television,
films, these things
have gone in to the
very homes of people
And stirred up a healthy curiosity
about the earth that they live on.
These are the people I work for.
If I can I'm gonna bring them
one of these creatures...
They can learn and profit from it.
-You really believe all that?
-Sure I do, Doc.
They give the world a whole new concept.
A new slam on humanity,
Help us to know and
understand ourselves better.
Don't you think that's important?
-You'd appear with this creature?
Show it on television?
-All the means, I'll use them.
Look, don't you understand?
Dr. Rollason, writing
little boring book in the corner...
isn't enough anymore.
it's a new age of awareness.
It's a big age. You got to
measure up to it, Doc.
-You better get some sleep.
You got an early start.
-Yeah, well, you think about it.
-I can not understand them.
-Foxy! Foxy!
-Come on, get inside.
Now, what's the matter?
All right. You get paid
when Sahib comes back.
Now shut up!
Now go on, go on.
It's alright, they're only Friend's
porters. Apparently they haven't been paid.
they gave you a bit of a shock, huh?
Now, you sit down there, have a spot
of this, you'll feel much better.
-Why do you suppose he
didn't pay them, Foxy?
-Oh, just to make sure they're
here when he comes back.
It's customary and reasonable.
Then why did they
suddenly behave like that?
-Well, you know how they are,
when they got nothing to do they...
they stand about and chat for an hour,
give them work themselves out...
Drink this.
- What's that?
- What do you mean?
- It's as if they knew something.
-As if they knew Friend wasn't coming back.
- Now, Helen...
Or John, or any of the party. They're
going to die and everybody knows it.
-Now, stop it, Helen,
You're talking raving nonsense.
Now, come on, drink this.
You didn't sleep last night, did you?
make sure you do,
if not, take some tablets.
-I stayed the whole night just thinking...
I never felt so lonely.
Just heard from time to time
the gong and the wind.
Foxy, you know these
things these people believe in.
Clairvoyance? Thought transference?
- Sham magic.
- Is it sham?
Helen, this country is
rotten with superstitions.
It’s only dangerous because we are
surrounded by people who think it's real.
We can slide into thinking it's real to.
Now, come on, drink it
 up. You'll feel much better.
Make sure you're not pursued by
the lads of the village again.
I think I'm going to have
 a word with the llama.
- It's a good idea, I need to...
- You stay right there.
And if you should feel
 like another nip of that...
nobody's going to call you a tippler.
-Sir?
Is anyone there?
Sir?
Sir?
- They're particularly out of sight.
- Yes, they are going well, too.
- How much longer will this take?
- I found what I wanted.
-Evidence of possible food supplies.
A type of moss, highly nutritious.
- You mean it's food?
- It might be.
Look, let's go on.
I don't want that swine
to get too far out of sight.
- You don't trust him?
- Tom Friend? No more than you do.
-You're not a very good climber, either.
Why did you come on this trip, McNee?
-I had to.
-You had to?
Ever since that time, two years ago,
I...I felt that this
what I must do. it's a..
.it's a sort of obsession.
Perhaps a psychologist could
explain it; I don't know.
All I know is I've got to find the thing.
Getting hint of the fall
this whetted your appetite.
It's all that matters.
- I...
I...I applied to join all sorts
of climbing expeditions...
Hoping I'd be able, but
I was turned down, every time!
-Then you heard about
the Tom Friend expedition.
-He wasn't so particular.
I...I paid him to let me come.
-You paid him?
-I...I can be useful, I'm good
with the camera.
-But not good with
an ice axe, and
men like you could be dangerous
-No, I'll try not to be.
-Come on.
-Hello!
-Friend! Where are you?
-He said pitched camp
at the ice wall.
-We're right at the middle of it now.
They can't be far away.
Hello!
-Wait a minute.
I thought I heard something.
Voices.
Ahead of us..
Are you there?
-Hello!
A trap. A steel trap.
-Get it open! Try!
I can't. It passed onto the rock.
-Hey, don't smash that!
Is valuable.
Here, here, let me do that.
- Did you set this?
- What do you think?
-Without warning us?
-You wanted me to put
 a flag on it, or something?
And I knew he was coming this way.
-Get him!
-Okay, get your foot out.
-He's down her path.
-This is why my improvement of the
bear trap. Digs deep but doesn't tear.
-It didn't even bite through the boot!
-Oh the idiotic, manic ideas.
What did you want to achieve
setting this trap?
-We've achieved it.
before you blow your top, Doc, listen.
- It worked.
- What?
-We caught one of those things.
You don't believe me?
Well, come and look.
-Watch out. It's ice up here.
- Give me a hand.
- Here.
-We found these little trace, see?
So I set traps on the chance that
whoever made them might come back.
- Little tracks?
- Yeah. You wait and see.
- Hey, Tom, they're here.
- Good.
Kusang. Pull it tighter.
Pull me that top one.
-Oh, finally made it, huh?
We couldn't wait on you.
There it is.
-Not very big, is it, Doc?
-Not more than four feet high.
But Kusang has no doubts.
- Kusang tell what it is.
- Yeti.
- The same as you saw before?
- Same.
- Like that?
- Same.
That's the expert, Doc.
I guess maybe we might
have made a mistake ,huh?
Let's get it covered.
-Let it go.
- What do you mean, "Let it go"?
- Is a langur, a monkey Himalayas.
You'll find him in all the
zoos in the world.
-Kusang said...
-Forget about Kusang, he's never
seen the creature we're looking for.
-Yeti. Yeti.
-Knock it off will you? All your little
trapping's done is defected one of our men.
- Doc?
- Yeah, he just happened to fall into one.
- Where can I treat him? In here?
-No, that's just our supply.
Let's take him over to the tent.
- Come on, Jock.
- Come on with me.
-You'll be alright.
-Steady, now.
-Kusang, tie him down.
-How is it?
-Apart from the bleeding,
maybe a cracked bone...
But without an x-ray I can't tell.
-Does it hurt?
-Hey, are you sure you
got the right station on?
-It should be.
-I fixed it. Waiting to see if they
give us a weather forecast, Doc.
And now short weather forecast
in English for Himalayan climbing party.
First the Tom Friend expedition in
western Himalayas.
You may expect occasional
snow storms...
Rising to blizzard
force by tomorrow night.
Further outlook
heavy snow continuing.
Next, Devon expedition
in eastern part of the Himalayas...
- Blizzard. That's all we need.
- We've got 24 hours.
-This man can not march tomorrow.
 It's out of the question.
- Tom, we'll dig out the sledge.
- You've got a sledge?
Yeah...-Yeah, but
it's not for him.
So what's it for, then?
Listen, Doc, this expedition
cost a lot of money...
And I'm not going back empty-handed.
That animal we got in the cage out there,
you say it was some kind of a monkey...
- Of course it was.
- Well, that's mysterious Yeti...
or snow man, we proved that.
 Kusang here confirms it.
Meaning?
Meaning that from now
on, we sell that fact.
I got to get that brute down to India. That
particular, verified specimen of the Yeti.
- Sales promotion.
- I can do it, I know how to handle it.
- Sure, Tom, like with Francini that time.
- Shut up!
-Francini case?
Were you mixed up in that?
-He doesn't know
what he's talking about.
-There is no Tome Friend
in it if I remember .
How long have you
used that name?
-I use what name I like.
Just what case
do you think you're
talking about?
-The Indian wolf tomb.
That he did live by
wolves in the jungle.
Alright...
But after a while turned out to
be plain well mental detectives.
-Alright, that's what the people wanted.
-Another new concept of humanity.
-You're nothing but a cheap trickster.
Shut your damn mouth!
-Watch it! The radio!
-Shut up!
-Well, that's taken care
 of the weather forecast.
-It's the altitude, right?
-I don't know. it makes
you lose control.
-I'm so...I'm sorry, Doc.
- Forget it...
-How do you feel, McNee?
McNee?
- What does he have?
- Hush! Listen!
The cage.
Give me the torches. Careful.
Bring some flares.
-Yeah.
Come on, we may need you.
-Look at the cage,
is all twisted.
-He's gone. He's got away.
And the door, it's all etched off.
-I just don't understand this.
-Let's see...she if we
can figure out the tracks.
- Oh, the snow's all trampled about.
- Hey, watch this.
-Look, there's his track.
Hey, look at that.
They're two different kinds.
- Look at the size of it!
- 15, 16 inches long.
There is no doubt about it,
there was something else out here, too.
-Put out that torch out.
-Yeah. What are we going to do?
Try to follow it?
Kusang, get the rifles, quick!
Kusang, run, get the rifles!
- What was that?
- Light the torch!
-There's something by the tent!
-Kusang.
-Kusang, what was it?
It was you that yelled us? Kusang!
-Hey, Tom, look!
Those big tracks all around you.
-McNee.
McNee.
- Are you alright?
- What was it?
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.
Give me your gun a
Nd some of those spears. Come on!
- Enough?
- Yeah!
-What did it look like? What did
you see? Kusang, tell me.
-I see...I see...
what...what man must not see.
I see true Yeti.
- Kusang.
- You made me see!
-Kusang!
Kusang!
Come back, Kusang!
Kusang! Come back!
Kusang!
- Find him?
- No, but I found something else.
- What's that?
- One of your traps all broken up apart.
Come on.
-Alright. Any sign of Kusang?
-No. You can bet he's
 headed back home by now.
Going down, it will only
take him a few hours.
- He was out of his mind.
-Yeah, well, he had good
cause if he saw what did this.
With this and those footprints
we should get a pretty
good idea the weight of
the thing that made it.
-Looks like you were right Doc.
-Okay, but don't forget
 the vital part.
This creature may
have an affinity of a
man. Something in
common with ourselves.
-Just remember that,
before we start shooting.
-Sure, sure.
- Hey, is he getting delirious?
- I'm afraid so.
-You took care of his ankle.
-I did what I could, but this here is no
hospital. That's where you ought to be.
- Oh, give another set of dope.
- No, that's enough.
-Alright, McNee, alright.
Go to sleep, old boy.
You're fine. Did you hear
 what I said, McNee?
- He's almost in a condition of trance.
- Trance?
-This is the way I thought
of the thing being here.
-What are you getting at?
-I'm not sure.
-You mean he's affected
 by him in some way?
It's not impossible. If he were
hypersensitive to their presence.
-Their presence?
When it gets like this
they might be close?
It's only a wild guess.
- McNee, McNee
-The eyes...
-Mcnee
- He's in a complete state of trance.
McNee, can you understand me?
Can you hear me, McNee?
-His pulse.
-Tom, I think... there's
something out there on the ice..
I got it, Tom! I got it!
-Careful, Tom.
-He's dead.
So that's it.
Really it.
Abominable Snowman.
-The size of that body!
-Looks like you underestimated, doc!
Must be ten feet.
Could be eleven feet high.
-Yeah.
-There's more of them!
-They know.
-First we've got to get
this thing back to camp.
Us three will be able to manage.
Ed, go get the sledge
and give me the gun.
-Right.
-Foxy!
Foxy, wake up.
-What's the matter?
- The poser has come back!
- The poser?
-The one they took with them.
The man named Kusang.
-You must be dreaming!
-No, I'm not. I saw him in the courtyard.
He seemed exhausted and
could hardly stand up.
He's not there now.
They took him away.
He was there, Foxy.
They took him to that door.
I've got to know what this means.
-Helen, for heaven's sakes.
- I'm going to see the Lhama
- Helen, calm.
- Helen, you never see
 him at this hour. You...
-Drink this, drink it.
You've been frightened.
One of my servants
found you wandering
in the secret part
of the building.
I was looking for you.
Kusang's come back/
-Kusang?
-The porter who went with
my husband and the others.
- I saw him in the courtyard.
- You're mistaken.
-No, but I am not mistaken.
I saw him, I tell you, in the courtyard.
-It was not Kusang.
-But I swear I saw...
-You are concerned for your husband.
-He's in danger, I'm sure of it.
-Danger?
Yes. They are in danger.
Danger?
All of them?
From their own actions?
-I don't understand you,
but you've got to help
me do something. Warn
them, bring them back.
- I can do anything.
- Why?
-It is not possible to
bend the destiny of men
The fate of your husband will
be governed by his own nature.
Mr. Fox, you will conduct this
lady back to her
living quarters.
-I'm so sorry about this, sir. Come on.
- Get me away.
-You're gonna be Kay, now.
- Get me away.
- Of course yes.
-Do they not even realize
the hopelessness they're in?
We've got to find him, Foxy.
There's no way of telling
where they are by now.
-With three or four native guides
we have some chance.
- Native guys?
- I'll talk to the porters down there.
-You'll never persuade them to go,
not into those high valleys.
I think I can.
But suppose that the
llama forbids them to?
-Listen Foxy, they're waiting
for money, aren't they?
Well, I can give it to them.
-For heaven's sake,
Helen, you're
not going to give them all that.
I'll give them all I've got, Foxy.
-Alright, but let me handle it.
We don't want to overdo it.
There's one of them now.
Where are the others?
Where are the others?
Well, call them for me. Call them.
-Alright. Alright. Now
 I want all four. All four.
Alright, now, wait, wait, wait.
-Hey, Doc.
- Hawk, the Harold angels.
- What's the matter now?
- Doc! Come down here!
-I'll come when I can!
They're noisy.
We'll transverting to the cave.
It will
give us protection
against heavy snows.
-Don't tell me Friend is
delaying here for my sake.
Oh, no. No he's not.
He says ??? ....
In a couple days this
 all should be usable.
-Thanks to you.
Tell me, what does it look like?
-The dead one?
-Uh-huh.
Well, you'll see. There's a
lot of nothing but guesses.
It''s massive and its height
is about ten foot five inches.
Weight 650 pounds,
age is difficult to assess.
-No, that's not what I mean.
Didn't you see what it looked like?
-The face?
-Yes, but there's nothing apelike about it,
There's nothing human, either,
but I thought it had...
-Go on, go on.
-Sadness and there's probably
only a surface resemblance
of wisdom.
-Rollason, we need you down here.
- How does it feel?
- Better.
-But try to ease the boot on slowly.
And I'll take these packs and
 come back down for you.
-Hold it there a bit. Alright?
Doc, come around this side.
- Gee, Ed, pull.
- Ok.
Let's see if we can get a little more
inside.
Let's see if we can pull more ...???
-Well, I'll get you down there now.
McNee.
McNee!
McNee!
-He's gone.
-Gone?
-Yes, without this and without ???
-Up there, look.
-McNee!
McNee!
McNee!
McNee!
McNee!
-Watch out!
He must have hit the rock,
it would have been instantaneous.
-They killed him.
It was the sound of that howling.
He couldn't stand it. It drove him mad.
-He failed because his foot was useless.
-They killed him!
Ed.
Ed, you alright?
What happened?
I just got to it. The
gunmen...I just got to them.
What happened?
-They came at me! Two of them!
You just don't know what it's like.
In the light...
- They, they...
- Here, take it, Rick.
- But how did it happen?
- Take it easy, Ed.
Go on.
- I... I just came of the cave and the two
came running towards me.
The size of them!
They were incredibly fast!
-I got my gun!
-I know!
You blasted off
enough to start an
avalanche, but you missed them.
Yes, it was like
this, the sun was in
my eyes and I couldn't
get organized.
-Tom, they're after me.
They know it was me who did that.
Now get out there... -They're after
all of us! They just killed McNee.
-Why say that? It was an accident.
-It's me next. They know it was me.
Oh, don't worry. I've had this before.
Me and a grizzly once,
we ran a war for
the whole winter.
I can handle it!
-But we want to act, that's
what we're gonna do! Right now!
Hey, Tom, let's get
some action! why do we just sit around?
We know they are up there.
Why don't we go up there and find them?
-Look, kid, I've got an idea.
You've had a lot of tough assignments.
Can you handle one more?
-That's what I want, yeah, action!
-Can you rig that steel net
up on the roof of that cave?
Yeah, I guess some
 sort of little trap or
anything if I go in there?
-Yeah, I can do that.
What about to bring him in the trap?
Who does that?
-I get it.
I do.
I'm in the back there
I think as bait, right?
- Right.
- You're a catcher, Tom.
-Oh, sure I'll do it, I told
you that's what I wanted.
Let's get to work while
you still got me in mind.
-Yeah, well, let's get it cleared.
Give me a spade.
-Ah, here's one. Why do you
want a spade for?
-Oh, yeah, Jock.
-Foxy.
Foxy. Foxy, a food container.
They've been here. We must go on.
-We damn hope not.
We're gonna camp here.
Listen, if they realize
where we go, they will all
desert. And this time,
you'll never get them back.
-Tom, it's all fixed.
Come and look.
- Alright.
-Well, there she is.
One pull on this and the
whole thing comes down.
-I'm sure it will work.
-Ah, test it and try!
Nice work, eh, Doc?
You know what I feel?  I don't like
the idea of you parting least of all.
-If you want advice...
-Listen Doc, he doesn't need your advice.
He can pull up any time he wants to.
- -Who wants to pull out?
-It's your business of course.
but the risk cannot be calculated.
-When that thing falls anything
underneath it will be fully occupied.
That's Tungsten-steel with a break
and strain of 20,000 pounds.
The more it struggles, the more
 the whole thing tightens on it.
An addition to which...
here you are, Ed, clean and loaded.
-Thanks, Tom.
Just in case I should need it.
- Just in case.
- Ah, you can trust me.
-I am trusting you with
this unique specimen when it shows up.
It began to snow out there again.
Listen, Ed...we...
we'll keep you covered from the
tent and check every half hour, but
oh, if anything happens, you signal.
- You bet I'll signal.
 - Alright.
-This is complete madness, Friend,
and you know it.
-Relax, will you? He
knows how to hold his fire.
This blizzard...
- You can see the cave?
- Yeah, so far.
-You better call it off.
-Call it off?
 This snow may be just the
thing they're waiting for.
-That man is depending on it.
-If he gets in trouble, I'm gonna help him.
Don't worry.
Friend, why not settle
for the one we've got?
-I've said no.
-You've cracked the mystery. You've proved
this creature exists. Settle for that.
- Take back a dead one?
-If we can.
H-ave them pick it, write
out running reports,
take a skeleton and call
him something Rollason?
-I'm not looking for credit.
-No, not gonna be like that. He's mine.
-Like the famous wolf children?
-Just the opposite, this is not fake,
That's why I’m not gonna give up.
-I'm gonna prove to them
 I can bring the real thing.
-You can't drag this down to a
personal level. It's far too important.
-Not to me.
-Listen, it's a long land creature.
It's strong, intelligent.
And they have powers
we haven't even developed.
It might have been headed to
 the earth. Something they keep hidden.
And hinted is the last of a species,
hiding away where nothing else will live.
Waiting in misery and
despair for final extinction.
In addition there is also a moral issue....
-Look, if they drop the
H-bomb, your...
your descendents, too
might end up in the ice.
-Did you see anything?
-Well... I thought...
No.
No. Let's ...let's have a cigarette.
-Tom!
-It's okay, we're turned.
Stop.
-I can't see a thing.
Rollason, let's keep together.
 Come on!
-There it is!
Ripped to pieces!
Ed!
Ed!
- He's dead.
- Dead?
Well, but...
-How did they kill him?
-I can't find any mark.
It looks like a heart attack.
- His face...
- I think he died from shock.
He didn't use the gun! Why?
-There.
- Just a minute.
-the magazine's empty.
It's strange.
Each shell has been
fired in it but it didn't go off.
They didn't go off, Friend.
You loaded shotgun.
What with? Fake ammunition?
-I didn't want another dead one.
I knew he would fire
even if the net held.
He was scared.
-They did want this.
The shotgun must have frightened him off.
I think that was what
 all they wanted.
-You mean they went after Ed?
-No.
- But they killed him?
- No, they didn't, Friend.
-You did.
-Think that will stop them?
-It will give us a fighting chance
if they decide to attack.
- If they do.
- So you think they won't, eh?
Let me tell you something.
We're not gonna
take any chances of
losing that one.
Plus, We do like you said, Doc.
Be satisfied with the one we've got.
-I think this is a little late.
It's cold in here.
- Want a drink, Doc?
- No, no thanks.
-Yeah we go to keep alert, keep
our circulation up, be ready for them.
We had to hit the first time.
There may not be a second chance.
-What's on your mind?
-I wonder if they'll try.
-Try?
-They know you've got a
gun and what it can do.
-They knew Ed had a gun
and it didn't stop them.
-Bet they knew what you
knew about Shelley's gun.
-You mean they get...thought transfers?
Oh, don't give me that.
Let's get something,
Doc. These are animals.
Dangerous killers. And
that's all they are.
-McNee died from an accident.
-Shelley died of his own fear.
-There is much out
there that's dangerous.
So much as Moxy and us.
-What are you doing there?
I'm wondering...
wondering how old that face is.
It's seen a long life
longer than ours, I should say.
A hundred years, perhaps more.
This isn't a face of a savage thing...that
-It's gentleness.
-Gentleness?
-Suppose they are not just
a pitiable remnant waiting to die out.
They're waiting yes...
waiting for us to...
-For mankind to die out?
-There's something the Llama said,
about taking thought of man's successors.
I didn't understand then,
but suppose we are the savages?
-We're what? Are you
out of your mind, Doc?
-Perhaps then we'd be in the Dark Ages.
protected ourselves too long.
Perhaps we are not  Homo
 Sapiens, the thinking men,
But has our thinking brought us to.
But Homo Westerns
They're the destroyers.
When the world knows about these
creatures, they're destroyed, too.
And because we are men,
we can only be here to destroy them.
They must be aware of that.
- I mean, we're the enemies?
If they can deal with us,
your secret's kept.
- It's our only chance of survival.
- Up here on the ice?
Survival for what? - It's enough
until their half of the time comes.
- Doc, you better have a drink.
- We could have something to eat.
-That's a good idea, then
 we'll turns on watch.
Throw me some in those
 self heating cans will you?
It's like living inside
of an iceberg here.
-Soup coming up.
And now short weather
forecasts in English
for our Himalayan
climbing party.
First the Tom-Friend expedition in
the western Himalayas.
You are warned to return
to base immediately.
Abandoning all gear.
I repeat. Abandon all
gear and return.
- Friend.
- Yeah?
- Where's the radio?
- Over there. It's all smashed up.
-Smashed?
- If you were thinking of
trying to fix it, you can forget it.
It's broken.
-Didn't you hear?
-Hear what?
I told you that thing is wrecked.
- Friend, we must get out of here.
- What's the matter with you?
We're gonna get out of here
when it's daylight and not before.
What is the matter with
 you? Are you cracking up?
-Yeah, maybe that's it.
A touch of altitude sickness.
-Yeah, well, go get some
oxygen, right over there.
Alright, just turn the tap,
 it's all ready for use.
- I'll use it.
Don't want you going sick on me.
Won't be easy managing
 that sledge tomorrow.
All that new snow will bound
 to make it unstable.
Feeling better?
-Yeah.
- Is that better?
- Yes.
It's gonna be tough going
we'll just have to get out
of the middle of this glacier
and just keep going.
That's all, keep going.
-Help!
Help me!
-Ed...
-Tom...help me!
Tom, help me!
-What's the matter with you?
Didn't you hear that?
-What...can you hear?
-Tom, help!
-It's Ed. I can hear  him
yelling out there. They got him.
- Stay here, wait!
- Ed, I can hear you! I'm going!
-Don't you understand? that it isn't
Shelley, it isn't anybody.
- But I can hear his voice.
- It's in your own mind!
It's just happened to me too.
- I've got to save him!
- Listen, Shelley's dead!
- No, no, that's a mistake!
- You need to stop. Can't you understand?
Ed, I'm coming!
Friend!
-Tom, help me!
-Ed!
Ed.
I don't understand, Ed!
Ed, where are you?
Ed!
-I'm here!
I came to help you and
 this time I mean it!
-Friend!
Don't use the gun!
The snow!
The snow!
Help, Tom, help!
Help! Help me!
Ed, I can't see you!
-Stop firing!
Come  back!
Where are you, Ed?
Where are you?
Where are you, Ed?
Friend!
Come back! It's an avalanche!
Get under cover, quick!
Friend!
Friend!
Friend!
Friend!
Friend!
Friend.
-Helen!
Helen! Helen!
Helen!
Here, wake up! Grab one of these.
Follow me. Come on!
-John!
John!
-Helen!
-I found him!
I found him!
- I'm sorry, this has
 been for you a severe trial.
All your companions
dead and all these accidents.
And  through all this sufferings,
You did not find what you went out to seek?
- I'm afraid I was wrong.
- Wrong?
What I was looking for does not exist.
-You are certain of that?
-Yes.
There is no
Yeti.
