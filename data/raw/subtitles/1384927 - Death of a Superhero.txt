Oh God, not again.
Why do you think you're here?
Donald.
Why do you think you're here?
Me thinkin'.
What are you thinking about?
Hmm?
Come on...
what are you feeling?
- Sometimes we can be so...
- What time is it?
Don't worry. Plenty of time.
Are you...?
Are you leaving?
Yeah, I have to get nuked.
All of these sick little boys...
Oh, they all need my
attention, don't they?
Now, where did I put
my thermometer?
Uh-oh.
Somebody's lost all his hair.
Ohh...
poor little sad baldy-boy.
Hmmm.
I've waited so long for this day.
Show time!
You don't look so hot.
So many ways to die.
So little time.
So Jeff got in this morning.
He's a bit jet-lagged, but
he's dying to see you.
Yeah, he can't wait.
Oh, I put you down for
higher level maths.
Mr. Duggan reckons you're bright enough.
I think you're well capable.
Oh, and you need to
try on your new...
They're marathon girls, man.
None of this Catholic guilt shit,
they're up for it, you know.
Oh, I gotta live there.
I gotta live there, definitely.
Best sex I ever had in my life.
- What about Joanna?
- No, she's not bi.
- No, I mean are you still going out with her?
- Yeah.
You dirty dog.
I, uh... I hear you're gettin' lifts
home off the Gardes these days.
You gotta stop all that.
You're drivin' Mom crazy, Don.
Eh, she falls asleep there most nights.
She's practically a
professor of cancer now.
And have you heard about Dad
turnin' to God?
- No way!
- Yeah, he sneaks off to mass on Sunday.
Think he's tryin' to make some type
of deal with God or something.
No, I can't blame him.
Not meant to die before
our parents, are we?
Sorry.
Oh, there was this one chick,
she's 25, ballerina, she moved
down for the summer, right?
So she was exactly the same as us and
she had around five mates with her,
and they all lived there in one...
Help! Help!
Oh, my God. Help me!
Oh my God, quick! Hurry!
Oh, please, please help me!
You saved my life.
What do you look Like
underneath that...
[Screams]
So, you wanna make love?
Oh,
oh, please.
Pretty please?
Are you stoned?
- No.
- Are you smokin' dope?
- No!
- I'm not an idiot, Donald. I can smell it!
I'm not...
What's goin' on?
Mom! Can you get out. Get out!
This is my room, get out. Out!
He's very angry.
We're just afraid he's
gonna do somethin'...
stupid, or harm himself.
Of course, he's angry.
Wouldn't you be angry?
Thing is, it's he's seen everyone in Tupholme,
you know, he's seen every psychologist, so he won't...
- You see, he won't... he won't let anybody in.
- We don't know what to do.
- And, and he will not talk. Not to us, not to anyone.
- Not to me.
I read your book on art therapy.
I think you could really... just connect with him and...
This is all he's interested in,
is drawing, just drawing.
Spend hours in his room, doin' that.
He's a good boy.
Ah, here we are. Shelly Fitzgerald,
I have you down in 4C.
It's O'Riley.
Oh, they have you down here as Fitzgerald.
I don't go by that name. But don't stress it,
I won't be long here anyway.
So you're the hero,
grabbing all the headlines.
Well, let me introduce myself.
They call me...
The Glove.
You've heard of
the circle of life,
well this is the
circle of death!
Do you know who I am?
Shrink number 6?
Do you do Greek at school?
No.
The Greek word for "death" is thanatos.
I'm a thanatologist.
Doctor Death?
Sometimes I can help people if they're...
afraid of dying.
I'm not afraid.
Oh, excellent.
So, are you gonna ask
me any more questions?
Well, I mean, uh...
Do you feel well?
Look, I'm here because me parents are
just a bit freaked out, that's all.
Why is that, you think?
Mom says I'm not fightin' the disease.
Is that true?
What's the point?
I'm not gonna win, am I?
Well, nobody's gonna win.
You're right there.
Always, death wins.
These are pretty crappy paintings, you know.
That's right, your mother said
you were a bit of an artist.
Yeah, but more this century sort of stuff.
Like what?
That wouldn't be your bag.
Wait, well...
I've gotta go, so...
Alright.
Oh...
are you going to commit suicide?
Do you think.
Your parents said you've
already given it a go.
- Yeah, I have.
- Right.
Well, let's not make another appointment.
The place smells of soup.
Don. What is this?
Go on, try some.
It's good.
Oh, God, that's
actually so disgusting.
- It's wheat grass.
- Wheat grass?
- Yeah.
- What's that?
I don't... I don't even know.
Mallow rat!
Don, what happened to your eyebrows?
Shut up, Michael.
How are you keepin', Don?
- No, I'm good.
- I think it's cool.
The eyebrows, it's kinda X-Men.
- You know, that guy with the...
- Yeah.
- Hi, Hugo.
- Hey, how you doin'?
To speak, or not to speak.
That is the question.
Or, more pertinently perhaps,
that is the dilemma,
each and every one of
us must grapple with,
if we fear the truth will wound.
To quote professor Milton Eames again,
and in conclusion,
stay silent and the truth
will stay silent with you.
Speak low if you lack the
strength, but speak.
And give not these lies of silence victory.
Um, very good, Miss Fitzgerald.
Excellent.
Surprisingly intelligent.
It's O'Riley.
Mmm.
Walk slowly!
Remember, feet not hooves.
Nice essay.
I'll see you later.
Okay, Donald, I'm gonna be direct with you.
To save time.
Why are you here?
It proves I'm legitimately mental.
So the cops have to leave me alone.
Okay, so it's in your interests then.
- Yeah.
- Great! Let's get cracking, shall we?
Yeah.
Let's do...
the shrinky thing.
Do you want to live?
Life...
is a sexually transmitted disease.
It's spread by people having sex.
And then in the end it kills you.
Who said that?
Was it, uh, was it The Glove?
You are very, very talented.
Stupid bastards! That is mine,
they had no right to give you that.
And how would you like it if
someone came into your house,
and started lookin' at all
your weird private stuff, huh?
Would you like something to eat?
Even for a superhero, he's...
he's pretty cool, isn't he?
But, why doesn't he ever say anything?
The women go crazy for him.
Well, why is he so
depressed all the time?
'Cause he can't get laid.
Yeah, but...
- but women are throwing themselves at him.
- I know, it's so messed up.
Well, why can't he have a girlfriend?
'Cause he's a superhero, isn't he?
He's too busy saving people.
Donald, what were you thinking
when you were standing up on the bridge?
I'm not gonna die
like some old lady.
Is that how you plan to do it then?
Jump off a bridge?
Who cares?
OD, jump, or somethin'.
Well, I care.
Well, you shouldn't. It's my life, it's my call.
It shouldn't concern you.
Yeah, but if I was the one who found you,
fellow human being lying in the street, dead,
broken,
I think it would take a long time to
get that image out of my head.
Yeah, but that would be your problem.
Yeah. Yeah, it really would.
Why do you give them tails?
- What?
- Those women in your drawings.
Are they meant to be some sort of devils?
No. No, they're...
um...
no, they're just stupid doodles, that's all.
Are they the kind of girls you like?
Sluts with big tits?
I think I'll go home after this.
Another dose of Chemistry. Please!
Like anyone in the real world's
ever asked me what a molecule is.
So what are you into?
Besides drawing.
- Umm...
- I'd say you're into writing.
Like, you seem like you're
in your head a lot.
- No. No, not really.
- Well, I'm the opposite.
Blurt stuff out all the time.
If somebody doesn't like it, that's fine, that's me.
What can you do?
Alright. Well, I'm off.
Good luck with your porn.
No. No, it's not porn.
Will you stop moving.
I didn't.
Hurry up, anyway.
Morning, Billy.
Donald, can you come with me?
Your folks are here.
See you later, sick boy.
Well, the white cell count is stable.
There's been no further deterioration, so...
you'll be very glad to hear, Donald, we
can at least get rid of that Hickman.
- So that's good, right?
- Yes, the radiation is really helping.
Well that's... I mean, we just...
just keep it up.
Keep fightin' the fight.
- Jeff!
- Yeah.
- Remind me to get some petrol, too.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here you go...
get some pizzas, DVDs, get a few beers.
- Alright.
- No, don't... No, don't get beers.
- Get a few beers!
- He's in remission, we're celebrating.
- Don't get beer.
That's not enough.
- You guys kill me. That's it.
- Thank you.
- Come on, we're gonna be late.
- See you, players. Good luck, guys.
Thank you, and, and, listen, um...
just one, um, beer for Donald.
So, eh, Jo... what are you doin' in college?
- English and Sociology.
- Oh.
The old man wants me to do law
but that's just... not happening.
- I couldn't hack a nine-to-five job.
- I'm not gonna go to college.
- You wouldn't get in, Michael.
- I would, I just don't want to.
I'm gonna take a year off, slow down.
What about you, Donald?
What are you gonna study?
Thanatology.
Oh yeah. Cool.
- Alright, lads?
- Yeah.
- Are you coming?
- Alright.
See you's later, yeah?
What's this? Ach! Can we
come and watch?
The legs on her, man.
Serious piece of work.
That was pretty clever.
What's... what's thanatology?
Yeah, what is thanatology?
Where is that from?
- Well?
- No, it definitely needs more alcohol.
This is a bad idea.
Did I, uh... did I tell you about Hugo?
Popped his cherry.
What?
- It means that he's no longer a virgin.
- Yeah, I know what it means. Is that true, Hugo?
- What?
- Michael said you popped your cherry.
Yeah. The weekend, yeah.
- With who?
- Who do you think?
- Sharon.
- Really?
- Yeah. It's no big deal, like.
- So, I mean, what was it like?
Oh, she's filthy, man. She's wild.
Seriously, she does... she does anything,
everything and anything. She's nuts.
What? Like what?
Give us the details.
I'm not givin' you details, you creep.
Where are them drinks, Michael?
Get up! Get up, get up, get up!
I'm gonna go get mine!
- Joanna.
- What is it?
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
Let's do it.
- I'm the one with cancer.
- Yeah, and you're gettin' better. Okay?
He's been suspended a week.
- That's if I live that long.
- Don't talk like... why are you talking like that?
- So ground me.
- You're in remission, okay?
And you've got a big
important year ahead.
You've got your exams, you've got...
I wanna organize that trip to France
and I'm not gonna be able
to do that for you...
if you don't get your head in the right place.
- Mom, look at me. Look!
Look at me.
Nothing is gonna change the
fact that I am fucked!
Now can I please just have a
little bit of fun before I check out?
Is that too much to ask for?
No one is sayin' you
can't have fun, son.
No one's saying that.
Mom, don't.
Please don't.
- Jesus, can you just stop it with the tears all the time?
- I'm not... doing...
- Don. Don, will you calm down?
- This is the nightmare that I have to live with...
- Don, please, will you calm down?
- I'm sorry if I'm getting upset about...
It's all right. It's all right, it's all right.
- Mom, you're wrecking with my head!
- Don.
- Just get out.
- Don.
- Please, can you just get out?
- Calm down, son.
- Dad, can you take her home?
- Son, we love you. We...
- Stop this! Fuck it!
- Don!
Anybody home?
Well, that went well.
They fuck you up, your mom and dad.
They may not mean to, but they do.
- You're not in pain?
- No.
They don't get it. They don't understand.
It was just a piece of graffiti.
And who really cares?
I don't give a shit!
Is that it?
Is that the...
the full extent of the...
Donald armory? The
full "rage" is it?
You know, I mean, if
I get angry I can...
I can really...
tank it, you know?
I'd really like to see you get angry.
I mean really angry.
Go on, show me.
Show me what you can do, Donald.
Go on.
Let's see the full fire of Donald.
Raaww!
That was terrible. Do it again.
Come on. Really, really... agh!
Go on. Go on!
Go on, you can do it.
Go on!
Kind of...
How come you miss so
many days of school?
Hospital stuff.
Handy excuse when you don't
have your homework done.
I sat the Junior Cert last year.
It's a doddle, seriously.
Don't sweat it.
So why're you repeatin' then?
I failed most of it.
And I got expelled.
- Ah, no, you're grand. I'll do it, it's fine.
- I've nothing better to do.
Okay.
I just couldn't be bothered
with the whole thing, you know?
Who gives a shit, really?
Whole exam thing is beyond ridics.
I know.
So how long have you been sick?
Um, just over a year.
Sucks.
Yeah.
What color was your hair, anyway?
Sorry?
Tryin' to imagine what
you were like before.
I don't know, it was dark.
- So, is the hair loss permanent?
- No, no, it's just while I'm in treatment, you know.
I like it.
It's edgy.
So, um, who's the guy on the motorbike?
Why?
Are you jealous?
There you go.
- Take it. It's carrot juice.
- I don't want carrot juice.
There's orange in it. It's nice.
- Do you want any?
- Coke.
A Diet for Jo.
- Please.
- Please.
Hey. Hey!
Have you read
this stuff?
It's your mom who needs the shrink.
She thinks you're gonna
get out of this alive.
Oh, Jesus.
Well, thanks Dr. King, that's, uh...
that's really professional.
- Well...
do you want to start talking?
Blah, blah, blah. Cancer. Cancer. Blah, blah.
- Right.
You don't wanna do any work.
I've got my own things to do.
You can let yourself out.
Fine.
Who is she?
That's my wife, Sophie.
I thought you were gay.
Why would you think that?
Just a vibe.
No offense.
So, is she a shrink too?
No, she's dead.
I went to your school.
To see your graffiti.
So what do you think?
Well, it wouldn't be my bag.
I want to show you something.
Here it is.
So, this is...
This is called a pieta.
It's a really important thing in art.
Oh, this is terrible. I've actually
done a better one somewhere.
I'm not really into religious type of stuff.
Well, no, neither am I.
So... why Mary and Jesus,
or whoever that is?
Well, because...
I get the feeling
it's bigger than that.
I mean, I've never managed
to pull it off, but
to capture that essence,
and emotion,
with clarity and a few simple strokes.
Not everyone can do that.
Takes a special kind of talent.
Thing is, Donald, that's what you've got.
You were here.
Whether it 'tis nobler in the mind to
suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and, by opposing, end them.
To die, to sleep, no more,
and by a sleep to say we end the heartache
and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation...
- Devout.
- ...devoutly to be wished.
To die, to sleep, to sleep
perchance to dream.
Aye, there's the rub.
For in that sleep of death,
what dreams may come, when we have
shuffled off this mortal coil,
must give us pause.
- Carry on.
- There's the respect
that makes calamity
of so long life,
for who would bear the whips and
scorns of time... that op... the oppressor
The oppressor's. Oppress.
The oppressor's.
The oppressor's wrong, uh, the man...
- Yeah.
- Quiet!
- Miss Fitzgerald.
- It's O'Riley.
The pangs of despised love,
the law's delay...
Hi.
How was school?
- It was pretty good, actually.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, what's that?
- Oh, chocolate cake.
Chocolate cake.
- That's not chocolate cake.
- Yeah, it is... well, it's carob, but it's the same.
- Apparently.
- It's not the same.
- No?
- No.
More sugar, I think... just...
put some more sugar in there.
It's gonna be okay, Mom.
It's gonna be okay.
Okay. Yeah.
Come on, hug over.
Thanks.
More sugar.
Careful!
Is it Tuesday?
No.
- Are you all right?
- I'm grand.
Do you wanna hang?
Hang?
Sophie and I used to come here all the time.
This is where we first kissed.
- No way.
- Yeah, right here.
- You still remember that?
- Of course I remember it, you cheeky sod.
A really... really profound moment for me.
It's really hard to describe. It's like...
it's like, it's like all your...
you know, you're in this incredible
heightened moment and all your...
your senses are working overtime
and your heart is thumping like crazy and, uh...
the excitement of it.
I'm breaking it though, I mean...
I... I've never... been
out with a girl before.
- What are you supposed to do?
- Well, you can do anything.
That's the point, that's why
it's so exciting. You just gotta...
close your eyes and
give yourself in to it.
What's her name?
- Shelly.
- Uh-huh.
Well, go on then, what's she like?
She's cool.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she's good. She's...
she's different,
you know?
Hey, you know the other day
you were talking about...
standing on the railway tracks
and the train was coming towards you?
What were you feeling?
All right, no Adrian, I'm just
doin' mental, that's all.
No, no you're not.
Like, uh... like I had...
control over somethin'.
For once.
Yeah.
Maybe death does win.
But at least I can decide when.
What are you gonna do
with your boat, Adrian?
It's just lyin' there.
You should do it over.

So what's with the name, anyway?
Is it O'Riley or Fitzgerald?
O'Riley.
So, where's the Fitzgerald come from?
That's the name of the bastard
who used to be my father.
My pathetic mother insists on us keepin'
it on even though he dumped us.
That sucks.
Yeah, at least it was quiet in the house.
The fighting was getting out of hand.
Do you see him much?
No.
I don't really get on with his girlfriend.
Besides, their havin' a baby soon, so...
I swear the day I turn eighteen I'm out of here.
You won't see me for dust.
- Where'll you go?
- Oh, New York... Paris...
- What will you do?
- I don't know.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I haven't found anything I'm good at.
You're like the smartest
girl in the whole class.
Yeah, who gives a shit about school?
I'm talking about
having a real talent.
Much like what you have, Donald.
Your drawings are brilliant.
I give anything to have a talent like that.
I'd love to be good at something.
You're amazing.
For what?
Everything.
Like...
you've just got your own take on things.
Not a talent.
But, like in English,
right, where you just made up that Hamlet essay,
on the spot?
- That was just drivel.
- It wasn't drivel! It wasn't.
It was brilliant, it was genius.
Like, nobody else couldv'e pulled that off.
Seriously, I think you could be
a writer or something.
Get us a drink.
Okay, hold on one sec.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
We're gonna just keep asking,
have you done it?
What are you talkin' about?
- Fucking shit!
- I'd say she's ready for a ballin'.
You had a lap-dancer of your own and
you never told any of us about it.
- What?
- Lads, I've got the clip!
He has the clip.
- I've got the clip.
- Come on, come on.
Wait, lads, that's, that's pounce!
Wait, look, look, look!
- Whoa! Go on!
- That is quality!
- Tits! Unbelievable!
- Yeah, tits! Look at the tits, man!
- Does she do that for you?
- Only in private, wanker.
I knew she was mental.
I knew she was mental!
Fair play, Clarkey, your girlfriend is nuts. She's dirty.
Well, she's not my girlfriend,
I barely even know her.
- Oh, well done, lads. It doesn't get old.
- Let's order in.
Shelly, whoa. Wait a sec.
Hold on.
It's fine.
- No, don't go! I just want to talk to you, that's all.
- Why?
You're not my boyfriend.
Shit.
I fuckin' blew it. I blew it!
- Do you want to come inside?
- No!
I wanna come inside a woman twat.
It was my one chance at love,
my one chance at any kind of
relationship, and I have just...
Tell me what happened.
Why?
So you can sit there and analyze me
and tell me what I really mean?
No, I'm done talking,
I'm done with the...
with the whole stupid therapy thing.
Okay? I'm just done with it. I'm finished.
Did she say something to upset you?
They're all filthy sluts anyway.
No, no, can you
just leave me alone?
Okay, you don't have to pretend
to be my friend anymore. Okay?
I'm not pretending, I am your friend.
Shall I call your parents?
Don't worry,
you'll get your money.
Why are you saying that?
Just leave me alone! Okay?
Just fuck off!
You know, it's rude to stare.
What age are you?
- Same as you.
- I'm six.
I'm 30-12.
No you're not.
What's your name?
Maya, what's yours?
I'm Maya, too.
- Same here.
- You're a man.
Yeah, my real name is Billy.
And what are you gonna
be when you grow up?
- A dancer.
- Wow.
I'm going to be a prince.
What's your real name?
- I'm going to be a super hero.
- No you're not.
Well, hello there.
Long time no see.
You didn't think we were done, did you?
I'm tired of waiting.
So young but so ripe.
Help me!
Donald.
Help me!
It's okay, son.
- It's just a nightmare.
- He was cuttin' me open!
- Shhh.
- He cut me!
- It's just a panic attack.
- He cut me open.
It's dad! It's dad, it's dad, it's dad, it's okay.
- It's okay, it's okay son.
- No!
- It's okay.
- Make it better, daddy.
Where's your grass?
- What?
- Your grass, where is it?
I don't smoke grass.
Are you any better?
Much better, thanks.
Yeah?
Hey, give us another go.
How cool is this, huh?
You know I'm only letting you do this
because it alleviates anxiety?
Absolutely.
So if your mother asks,
- Mmm?
- you know what to say?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
You'll back me up?
Thank you for being
here with me, guys. It's...
it's great.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes, we have lift-off.
Ooh!
Yeah.
Ah.
Very nice!
Very nice.
Everything's gone just a little bit to the left.
You know, you've been the
most incredible son to me.
You've given me so much.
So much,
that you will never know.
You're an amazing man.
Amazing.
And I love you.
I love you so much, son.
Thanks, Dad.
- Jeff.
- Yeah?
I think he was talkin' to me.
He is dying! Donald is dying!
Get that into your head!
- Well, he's alive now, isn't he?
- Yeah.
We had one joint.
- We talked. We had fun.
- I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not doin' it no more.
- I'm finished.
- He talked to me!
You're bringin' him to the hospital!

His treatment wasn't very intensive today.
Can I ask you not to stay too long?
Hi, Don.
I, uh, found this picture.
I know you didn't give it to me...
officially or anything, but, um
I really like it.
So, you could sign it for me, or somethin'.
I'll come back another time.
You know, all that stuff at
the party was... bollocks.
It was ages ago.
I was just on a mad one, you know?
Look, if you... if you wanna hang out,
when you're back on your feet, like.
That'd be cool.
Have either of you guys seen Shelly?
I don't know about Shelly, man, maybe
you should just forget about her.
Did you tell him about Sharon?
Oh yeah, we broke up.
Bummer.
It's no big deal,
I've moved on.
There's actually a party on tonight,
if you wanted to, I mean...
Yeah, but we're not invited.
It doesn't matter, we're crashing.
Always need guys.
What if, um... we asked around at school?
- Asked what?
- Donald's not gonna die a virgin, agreed?
- What, like a sympathy shag?
- A shag is a shag, Michael.
Well, fast, fast, fast.
Morna.
- Morna.
- What?
- Do you know, eh, Don?
- Who?
- Donald Clarke, from your year.
- Yeah.
Do you like him?
- What?
- Morna.
Give me a second.
Why?
Would you be willin'
to have sex with him?
What?
- Would you be willin' to have sex with him?
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
- No.
- Hugo, that's gross!
- That's fair enough.
Fair enough.
I told you.
- Are you havin' a piss?
- No, it's a real situation.
You guys are weirdos.
Okay, it's... that's fine.
We understand handily.
- Weirdos!
- Okay.
- It's like nearly sick.
- Okay, okay, fair enough.
If we were to... give you some money,
would that change your mind?
No!
I don't know about this, guys.
Look, we're here now, Jeff, you're not chickening out.
Okay, look at her. Over there on the
left, white wooly top with the tits.
- Look at her.
- Stop pointing, will you?
- I think she's all right.
- Okay.
- All right, Jeff, ask her.
- Wait, why me?
- 'Cause you're the oldest.
- What do you mean "the oldest?" This was your idea.
Okay. Excuse me.
- Excuse me, yes.
- Wait just one sec, Hugo. Hugo, stop!
- Hi.
- You all right, lads?
- Yeah, yeah, we're fine thank you.
- Um, no, we're not.
- Just ask her!
- He, um... he, he wants... he's...
he's lookin' for some...
- What do you mean, me? I don't want anything.
- Shh, just ask her.
- Umm... how much?
- For the three of you's?
- It's gonna cost you, love.
- Just think of them as ladies... for hire.
- Don't worry about mom and dad.
Just take your pick.
- I'm not sure about this, guys.
- We've tried everything else.
No one in school would agree to do it.
Would agree to do what?
Did you two go around asking girls
if they'd have sex with me?
- No!
- Yes.
- Did you?
- Keep it down, lads, please.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
- Did you?
- No.
- Well, hello, handsome!
- Superhero, my ass!
- Oh, pick me, pick me!
- Oh, you handsome boy!
You can have this, honey-bunny.
Choose.
Still thinking about that schoolgirl?
Billy died.
His parents are on the way in.
Okay.
What a night.
Was he in a panic?
No, no.
Excuse me.
Donald asked me to give you this.
Thank you.
So, Jeff was telling us all
about the New York Knicks.
- The stadiums, the girls.
- Yeah, I know. He never shuts up about America.
Come on now, it's a fascinating place.
Yeah.
So I was thinking maybe we
could go over, you know?
When you're feeling up to it, catch a game?
Yeah.
- I'll just get some coffees.
- Yeah.
Is he all right?
- Don't worry about us.
- I'm not worried about you.
You may be a mental control-freak, but...
you're strong.
I don't think he is, though.
He might need a bit of lookin' after.
So listen, I'm gonna go and do a shop in a bit.
Any special requests?
And this mysterious friend of yours,
what's his name?
His, his name is... Donald,
and he is...
he's a... a... he's a young man...
- Is he eighteen?
- Yes.
And you're sounding me out?
No! No, no.
Well, actually yes, I suppose
I am, really. I am, I am.
'Cause I just... I just need to know...
Adrian, rest assured.
I'll treat Donald with absolute sensitivity.
Thank you.
He's not eighteen.
He's never going to be eighteen.
Tonya, this is going to be his first,
and his last, experience.
Keep an eye on.
- I've got no clothes to put on.
- Just get into the bed!
- This is stupid. I look ridiculous.
- Not at all. - You look great.
Don't worry about it.
Oh, my hair?
Oh, my hat, it
might be in there.
What if a nurse comes in?
Just snore really loud.
- Your limo, sir.
- Thank you.
Right. Well, off you go.
It's, uh, second floor, number 21.
Hi.
You must be Donald,
come on in.
I'm just making myself a gin and tonic,
what would you like?
Um, I'll just have the same.
Ice?
Yeah.
Actually no, can I...
can I just have a Coke?
Sure.
Why don't you get comfortable?
Sit down, Donald.
Can I ask you something?
Of course.
What's sex like?
Really like.
And there's just a few things that I'd
quite like to clear up before you...
Well...
when you're with the right person,
you could say it's like...
it's like a competition,
where you're both trying
to let the other side win.
- Have you ever been in love?
- Sadly, no.
But why not? I mean, you're so beautiful.
A lot of men find me attractive,
but that's just a physical thing.
Being in love is so much more.
I hope to experience
that one day.
Adrian tells me that you're
a brilliant artist.
Would you like to see my drawings?
I would love to.
They are great.
Wow.
I'd give anything to
have a talent like that.
Wait, what did you just say?
I'd give anything to
have a talent like that.
I'm gonna miss you.
You're so weak.
Even a kiss could kill you.
You're toast, lover boy!
