Sonuvabitch screwed up
my whole night..
howled everytime..
...you pulled the trigger
lf we shot him in the back...
there'd have been trouble
Asked him to get lost
''but he fell on his knees,''
grovelling
lts difficult pulling
an encounter on a wimp
How can one kill a crying man ...
one should enter this world smiling
and depart the same
''Who was it, sir ?''
Forget it. ls it past 12 ?
''No, there's time yet''
''Who was it, sir ?''
- Nata...
Whose horoscope is that?
Mumbai's
''Sir, Nata''
Mumbai's horoscope!!!
So what does it predict?
''Sir, what about Nata?''
''- Yes, Nata's history..''
dead.
- When?
Yesterday and today somebody else is
''Going to get lucky, is it 12 yet?''
The two of you are Abbaji's men?
Just as you are
''mughal's girl, princess !''
Don't kill me please.
Hey none of that..
''Bastard, don't you know how''
to run this business?
Remember the first rule?
No targetting family.
Look up..look here..
Why did your gang kill
Abbaji's brother?
What did you guys think..?
You could eliminate his mob?
The 40th day of mourning..
ends at 12' o clock
lt will end tonight for you gang
Tell us where Mughal is
We'll let you go.
Miyan has given his word..
Listen...stop bawling...
Panditji is never wrong
Ask him what Mumbai's forecast
predicts.. Abbaji or Mughal..?
Maqbool..
Miyan Maqbool.
Greetings Miyan
Where is Mughal ?
- A word in private
Greetings Miyan.....
yes..at the bungalow in Gorai.
And Boti.. ?
Borivli..
at his in-laws.
Father in Gorai
and son in Borivli
''l'll take on Mughal..,''
you two take care of Boti
l'll go to Mughal's
Just do what you've been told
Fine
why don't you
go along with him too.
Why? embarrassed to kill
in front of me.
''Fine, then l'll accompany Miyan''
Stay put..
''Careful, son''
He's not your son
he's your dad.
''That's enough, Purohit sir..''
no more
''Drink up, princess..''
celebrate...
today's your lndependence day
What sir? lndependence day..
in November?
You've been freed from the clutches
''of Mughal's bed today, haven't you....''
Neither Abbaji nor Miyan
are into men..and guess what ?
Nor are we
''Watch it, man''
You have painted Mumbai red.
Which one of us betrayed..?
Lets get going
Hello..
''- Give it to Abbaji, Asif'
He is in Chhoti's room.
- Then call him
What news..?
''- Go on, call him''
Chhoti's not well...
He'll skin me alive
if l knock
''Fine, tell him we're off'
to the farmhouse
''When he gets time,''
he should ring up there
Mughal's dead..?
- Yes
And Boti..?
Papa... Papa
Get lost
Take the blasted kid outside
Want to work for us ?
Miyan and in love!
Miyan and women
What else is Miyan inheriting?
Your bad days are over.
You'll get what you desire
Whatever
For instance?
Bollywood
Bollywood! That's Abbaji's
brother-in-law's turf
That Asif will come howling
to him.
Your comet has entered the
7th position in your Venus chart...
This position heralds
your kingly reign
Forget Bollywood...
''ln 6 months, Abbaji's throne''
is going to be Miyan's..
King of Kings.
Shut your trap sonuvabitch..
shut up
lf l believed any of
''this mumbo jumbo, Pandit,''
l would have sliced
your tongue off right here
''Slice it off, miyan...''
Whatever he says happens.
6 months ago..
he just casually said..
Your neighbour's going
to die of AlDS..
''And guess what,''
this healthy buxom woman..
drops dead in 5
months. Unbelievable!
''You should feel grateful, wretch''
Miyan! He would forget
to take his weekly commission...
but never his daily dose of her
Don't Laugh. His
tongue foretells evil.
Any forecasts for me Panditji...
Take your time
Remarkable! lt's a miracle
you're still alive!!
You too ? Wise one..
l've shot as many guys as Miyan
that includes today's lot
l've seen your son's chart
The lad has real promise
He's the antidote to miyan
Speak up man
You fine...
Yes.. Fine
''Hey, this guy's really in love''
Who's this new chick. Name?
Purohit's neighbour
should i call her over...
for the night?
Hello.... Who Devsare ?
call at the station in the morning..
''Here, you speak, our man''
only speaks English
Who in the world is this Devsare ?
- Your new ACP
Heard a lot about you two
Who is responsible for this?
''- Sir, not the Police''
Where were you two
at the time of the crime?
''On Duty, Sir....''
Then you could have stopped it.
Things would have escalated.
The balance of power
is critical in this city.
Fire has to fear water.
Without moving a muscle we managed
to wipe out an entire gang sir..
And whoever's left is
on our side
''l mean, under our control''
lts far easier to
''control one gang, sir''
What's his name ?
- The Father.
l want his name not your
relationship.
Jahangir Khan...
Lalji bhai's commander-in-chief
at one time.
Started off his operations
smuggling gold. And after his death...
took over all the contract killings
and land mafia operations
The messiah..
of the minorities
whichever party he backs never
loses at the elections
Any arrests ?
Once..12 years ago
Attempts to arrest him only
resulted in riots all over the city
May Allah have mercy
its an irreparable loss
One has to pay for one's deeds
l'm in your hands Abbaji...
Be brave...
wounds take time to heal
Your father and my brother
are both lying in the earth...
And we do not even know
who killed my brother?
Who was the traitor?
Because of whom?
You were about nine
at the time of the wedding...
you are the only living memory
Rukhsana left me with...
...and memories should
not be trifled with
''l'll go away to Dubai, brother-in-law''
There's only one journey left..
and only one of us
can take it..shoot me
l can't..
Shoot me.. Asif.
- No...
Asif shoot me
Boti will hit back
at the first opportunity
He's been spared once...
and for all
''But, Abbaji..''
l don't go back on my word ever
This discussion is over
None of you will touch Boti
Anything else ?
What about the film industry?
Who's going to look after it?
Maqbool.
''Abbaji, l wouldn't know what to do''
with it..
Restore Abba's glory
''Bhabhi, give me the recipe for this!''
Filling!
But you keep wanting more
Festival food takes
on a blessed flavour
''Enough, my darling!''
Keep some room for dessert
''No way, l've had enough...''
''Uncle, l've made it''
Little one cooks just
like her mother..
Abbu!
''Ok, 'Little one', Sameera..''
everyone eats dessert.
And sings its praises ..
Water..
ls that all you're thirsty for ?
There's someone called Devsare...
''Yes, he is on his first posting..''
''Now, a new convert has to say his''
''prayers five times a day, Abbaji''
''Sir, three of our men killed in a week''
This is Chinna and that's Tavde..
they look after our
businesses in the suburbs
So Miyan..
how's Bollywood treating you ?
You may as well ask.
Trapped in a den of thieves.
''slimy people, slimier films''
You get a film made
on Abbaji's life
it will turn out to be
an all- time blockbuster
Got a pretty heroine for yourself...?
- That's already taken care of
Oh! Who is the beauty
who has enticed Mr.Stone heart ?
Abbaji.. Boti wants to arrange
meeting
''Don't evade the topic Miyan,''
who's the girl ?
Should we call him tomorrow ?
''Jahangir, we have go''
to the dargah tomorrow
You ask God for too many favours
lf only one was answered !
They'll all get answered bhabhi...
''Abbaji, Nimmi's''
got to have a film this year.
Just name the director you want
''Karan Johar, Subhash Ghai''
or Ram Gopal Varma ?
Well..
we could also consider Mani Ratnam
Stop ....
''l'll go walking from here,''
barefoot..
God forbid dear...
you'll get bruised
l'll offer up my bruises.
- Now what am l suppose to do?
You carry on in the car
Leaving you alone
What's the matter Abbaji ?
Love is a disease Miyan
The world is in my grasp...
except for this runt of a woman
wants to walk barefoot
''You carry on, l'll escort her''
Who's this heroine of yours ?
Pretty....?
More than me....?
That lnspector Pandit
is a rank liar
You'll never be able replace Abbaji
Why ?
''You're a wimp, that's why''
''Oh, l see''
Of course! and my passion
would consume you.
But don't have
the guts to even touch me..
Guddu is the rightful heir
''if there's no son , the''
son in law becomes the next in line
Son-in-law?
Sameera and Guddu!
How do you know all this?
l just do....
Rubbish ...
lt's a lie....isn't it ?
You're lying...
You never had the courage
to look me in the eye
''Still, l knew you wanted me ''
There are 12 moles on my body
Do you want to count them?
You can die for me
and even kill
''Now, is that a lie ?''
We stand face to face
O worship of my eyes
This is the sacred ground of love
Where none may commit offence
''Therefore, bow down your head''
And offer prayers in reverence
We stand face to face
O worship of my eyes
Grant me but this favor
That when l fall at your feet
May l never rise again
May my life run its course
Grant me but one vision
For though you are before me
''You are hidden, veiled''
Unaware of my anguish
Grant me but this favor
That when l fall at your feet
May l never rise again
May my life run its course
Face to face
My beautiful beloved...
Thus thinks an innocent heart
How glorious to have love
tear your soul apart
And so l go insane
And such is my insanity
That storms lie at my feet
And obsessions ravage my thoughts
Grant me but one vision
That l may dedicate my life
And shower it over you
O grant me one vision
For without you my life has no meaning
And my prayer has no substance
A life without meaning
A prayer without substance
Without meaning...
Without substance...
And so l go insane
And such is my insanity
That storms lie at my feet
And obsessions ravage my thoughts
Greetings Abbaji..
greetings..
Please don't go back to
the city today
Why?
The Minister says
he'll resolve the case within 2 days..
What case?
Devsare has taken out a warrant
in Abbaji's name
l'm too old to be on the run.
Let's go...
Who's parked these cars here?
ls your name Jahangir Khan?
Hey...come tomorrow morning.
We'll have the bail ready
ls your name Jahangir Khan?
- Address him as 'Abbaji'...
We've seen dozens of
cops like you
ls your name Jahangir Khan
How much do you want ?
We'll send it.
Get lost- go!
Miyan..no Miyan..
No Miyan
Sit down
You may leave
lts early morning.
No tea ?
Oh Dear!..
A Transfer. Where to ?
We're going miss you
May the lord be with you
''He's gone, right ?''
No need to blow his brains out
Fine..
l'll take his heart!
No point starting a new war
Bhosle's never going
to approve.
Then Bhosle's in for a public slap.
Ask him if he would like that...
Come
''Here, hit me...''
Cool off or you'll
burn the lot of us
''l, Jahangir, had to bear''
the humiliation not you
Ramzan begins tomorrow..
let's have peace till Eid
''Abbaji, Eid greetings !''
To you too..
''Abbaji, isn't there a feast''
at the mansion ?
Bhosle keeps provoking me.
This is a good time of year - Eid.
''Come for Bakr-Eid,''
we'll feed you mutton
How will you like your betel-nut
wet or dry ?
No thanks.
l don't eat paan.
lf you don't mind..
l didn't like the fact that
you were arrested.
Bhosle could have averted
it if he wanted
''Abbaji, l just need your blessings''
l can topple this government
within 6 days.
Bhosle will be left dancing
naked in the parliament
Eat
No thanks
Eat.
- l don't eat paan.
Get a good taste my dear...
it'll help block your tongue
Red looks good on your shirt
''Darling, do not get upset....''
l'll speak to madam
l've waited two years..
for these two days...
l'll be forced to lodge
a complaint with the association ....
''Darling, no threats please''
Hi! How's it going..
Get me some good role too
''Tell Jahangir sir, l wont pay up''
lf you want to shoot me..
go ahead and do it
Riyaz regards you as a father.
The deal was struck
for 3 billion with Mughal
We'll carry the consignment to the edge
of international waters.
There onwards...
you will have to escort it till
it reaches the shores of Bombay
Where will it be used..
''Kashmir, Delhi or here ?''
lt doesn't matter. But the money
will be sent to you...
all of it and that too before
the job is done
Some suicidal businessman
we have here!
''Even if we mess it up,''
you still pay up?
Not everyone works for a profit
We've come here to befriend Abbaji.
We're not worthy
of your friendship sir
Our business expertise..
and our feet are both grounded
on land.
Can't even swim...
''and hence, we stay away''
from the waters
''lf you wish, you could spread your''
business all over the world.
Mumbai is my sweetheart...
can'tjilt her at this age and
settle down in Karachi or Dubai
Would you care for some tea..?
''Abbaji, 3 billion rupees!''
''And that too, before the deal''
comes through
''lf we don't do it,''
somebody else will
One who doesn't care for a profit...
cannot be of any gain to anybody.
Always remember
Can't yet piss accurately and you're
opening your mouth about business?
''Next time you speak out of turn,''
l'll slice your tongue off
l'll gouge those eyes out..get out!
l can't use an English lavatory.
lndian one you can squat on?
Hey Miyan!
See the resort at Mauritius...
''Fantastic, isn't it?''
which is Miyan's room?
Where is Abbaji?
- He's resting
''He's resting man, you heard me.''
- At this hour....?
With her
Do sleep and desires have
fixed hours...?
Greetings Abbaji.
- Greetings
Magnificent!
lts really magnificent
Except for the number of cars
The betel's not soaked
''properly, dear''
Sameera..Sameera..
Let me introduce you
to our lord and mistress..
Without her approval...
we cant decide on anything.
''Speak dear, do you like it ?''
Good..
Good or very good?
Wonderful
Wow dad...
Where is my room?
- Right next to mine
l'm not staying next to stinky
pants.. will die of the stench
Miyan!
Yes...
Have you given it a thought..
Who's going to run this?
Who'll go to Mauritius?
Guddu
l'm not going anywhere.
Guddu will go to Mauritius.
- Why Guddu..?
Guddu will go.
- Why Guddu man..Why don't you go ?
Guddu will go.
- You son of a...
l've only one son and
he's not going anywhere
''Abbaji, Guddu will go to Mauritius''
What's up Miyan?
Why do you want to send Guddu?
l've fed Sameera since she was a baby
she means the world to me
What do you mean ?
Go ask the apple of your eye
What is he saying?
Bastard.
You bastard
You are carrying on behind our backs?
Even a dog never pisses
in the master's house
You son of a...
You really love her?
Will you marry her?
Then Maqbool is right.
You'll have to go to Mauritius
My daughter can't remain
in this swamp
Get up..
We are the ones giving
away the girl...Mr. ln- Law!!
Forgive me Miya....
for old friendship's sake
But l am never going to forgive you
Look what state you've
left our bridegroom in
He's the heir in the family now
lsn't he ?
lf Abbaji had heard of
your affair from elsewhere..
we'd both be dead by now
Precisely what he wanted
Ungrateful wretch..
you should thank Maqbool instead!
''lt's because of him, you are alive''
''You are really naive, father''
Can't even make out
the serpent from the charmer
That bastard must be
in mourning tonight
You!
We've suffered bullets for each other
Sameera's like his daughter
Anybody else in your place
would be dead by now
Relax dad. Finish your food
Not hungry
Listen son...
we're a small shrub
of a family
Don't poison its roots...
it'll perish
''Uncle, we need the red ones..''
Looks like you've plundered
the gardens of Mumbai
Too spicy
Don't want any mistakes tomorrow
Trust me sir
Greetings my dear
Everything's in a mess here
Your Miyan's done nothing
Neither the florists nor
the cooks are to be seen
What?
lt's the first engagement ceremony
''in the family, Jahangir''
Don't worry dear.
l'll stay back for the night
Just get my trousseau from
the tailors' tomorrow
See you dear
l'll slit your throat
Later. At night
What's this?
Give it back
''First Say, give it back my love''
l can kill you..
Say my love first
My love
You doing me a favour?
Say it with some passion...
My love
My love
Again
My love
''You, O love of my life''
''You, O love of my life''
My love
My love
Fine
Fine. My love
You can have it back
Why don't you go back to Lucknow...
you whore
''lf you agree to come along,''
what's Lucknow...
l'd go to the almighty.
Hey ..
Let me weep
Till l am spent
To my heart's content
But ah! My eyes...
They never seem to dry
So have they filled up with tears
That l shall weep for many years
When the rain drips down from trees
The leaves appear to cry
But those who live in fairer weather
Does no one hear them sigh?
''Give me, then, a sorrow new''
That l may adorn these eyes with dew
These tears are needed
- heaven-sent -
So let me weep
To my heart's content
What did you ask for ?
That every day should
pass..just like tonight
Not possible whilst he lives.
And after Abbaji is gone..
Get in quick.
Before the engagement happens...
you won't be able
to see Sameera...go on
''Where's Maqbool, dear?''
Cooking Biryani on the terrace
''Grind them well,''
get some garlic moron!
Don't chop it like that.
ls this the way to slice coriander..?
Move it..
Where the hell is my garlic?
Dear heart.. Come here
Somebody watch this pot
Seeing you cook with so much love...
Feel like throwing myself in the pot
''Here, take your license''
''Next time,''
look where you park
Commissioner sir
Not bad Boti.
- Rolex!
''With this watch, Boti's''
bad times also come to an end
To darling daughter Sameera..
one little 3 bedroom
''apartment, from Uncle Bhosle''
Great Uncle Bhosle!
Do what you like a politician
will remain as twisted as a snake
Even the gifts
are government donations!
''That's all, ''
What about you two?
Came empty handed?
''Yes, You two..?''
Not at all..
We've come with happy tidings
Devsare's got banished to the
high seas.. shifted to customs
''Abbaji remember, there was''
a raid on the day of your wedding
''The bloody cops frisked me all over,''
right from my turban to my underwear
What was the name
of that commissioner?
Deshpande
Lalji bhai blew his
head off with his own hands.
Wouldn't he have been
pleased if he were here today?
Don't remind me of him Kaka..
feel orphaned without him
You people just can't be trusted
That ACP Morya... Lalji bhai
considered him his own brother
the bastard blew his
ribs away.
''Abbaji, don't...not today..''
today's a festive day
Wipe your tears
Miss Mohini's here
Khusrau! The night of union
l spent awake with my beloved
''Sharing bodies, sharing minds''
Until all that remained was one
Abbaji's new heartthrob
''How simple her talk,''
how simple her thoughts
''But ah, the slyness of her glance!''
Alas l am torn - dare l walk
The path to my lover's home?
How embarrassing to be caught
The slippery courtyards of his house
''Red-footed, as l tread''
Forgetting my steps in fear
Oh l am driven insane!
Ah! Colour - glorious colours
My beloved's home
Bathed in magical hues
For the one whom l sought
''Both, home and afar''
''Behold, at all times''
He is by my side
Only Dilip Kumar could
have bettered that..
What..? What Dilip Kumar..?
lf he hadn't been
in the underworld...
he would've been a great film star.
What an actor Abbaji is!
There were three
people in the room..
''Lalji bhai, ACP Morya and Abbaji.''
Only he came out alive
Guess who's the traitor ?
The Police
Who's the bitch ?
The Police.
''His name, hidden in henna hues''
Burns my palm like a secret flame
Even my feet shine with eagerness
And l could die of shame
''l hesitate, unable to decide''
Should l go or should l stay?
Oh l'm driven insane!
Get lost!
Hey Miyan
Search for your name
You dance pretty well
''l'm so happy,''
l'm quite beside myself
Shouldn't you be dancing too?
l'm about to become a
brand new mother-in-law
''Now, let's see how well you dance''
By blessing of the Holy Ones:
''The Saints, Nizamuddin Auliya,''
''Qutubuddin Auliya, Farid-ud-din Auliya,''
''Alauddin Auliya, Nasirudin Auliya''
''They,the beloved of Allah''
''They, that light up all the world''
ln colours - glorious colours
Bathing in auspicious hues
My beloved's home
lt's time you sacrificed me too
Jahangir has got a new mistress
How can l face going home?
Everyone knows
l'm Jahangir's mistress..
He looks disgusting
with his clothes off
Must be my father's age
And he is my father!
l've been brought
up in this house..
Even dogs are brought
''up in houses, Miyan''
l can't see you wagging your tail
grovelling behind Guddu
You'll have to kill one of us..
Me...
or Jahangir
No trace of clouds in the sky
You really think it will rain?
''lt will only rain in June,''
at the wedding
Wedding..?
Any problem?
The girl is cursed
She'll leave behind a trail of
corpses before she weds
''So, what were you saying''
This is Maqbool's house..
Safe as a mother's womb
''Now, go have some milk''
He's been with me for 25 years now.
l owe my life to him
Hey.. Usman..
Take off your shirt
''Hey, don`t feel shy''
Turn
6 in the Byculla incident. Turn
4 in Kandla. 3 in Kolhapur
Not a single bullet could
scrape me to this day
He can do anything for me.
Anything
Anything?
Anything
Drink this
Drink Usman
''Pick up the bottle, Usman''
Usman..!
Strange night
For the first time in 70 years..
l'll see rain in this season
Have you decided?
lts critical to maintain the
balance of power in this world..
Fire must fear water
Hey..let's race
Mine flies higher..heh ! heh !
Ramzu.. Ahmed..
Why hasn't the blood
been washed off yet?
lts clean sir
''Fine, leave''
They're coming!
Kaka...
- Go back
Don`t you dare touch me
Go back
You heard me once..
Get out!
Nobody's going to split us.
We're brothers.
Kaka...
What did you get usurping
Abbaji's place?
That's what l want to know.
What did l gain by serving him...
Like a dog for 25 years?
Faced bullets..killed..
Only to see this day
Even you think that l killed Abbaji?
l don't know
Now tell me..you know or not?
tell me sonuvabitch
''Look at me, Kaka''
Look at me
Either shoot me
or embrace me
That's enough tears for now..
pack your bags
and get ready to leave
Guddu's coming for the
Niyaz ceremony tomorrow
''What's this brother, tell me''
Strength..power
and this..
''tell me, what's this ?''
Begging bowl!
Now is the time to stay together
lts been 40 days..
and nobody knows who did it?
There were three people
in the room..
''Usman, Abbaji and..''
''Anyway, we'll know by''
tomorrow
Whoever doesn't accept Maqbool's
invitation is Abbaji's murderer
ls it true that Nimmi and
Miyan sleep together?
That has nothing to do
''with business, brother..''
And the rules of our business
dictate that..
whatever was Abbaji's once..
now belongs to Miyan
Be it daughter..be it mistress
Miyan...
''Miyan, don't feed the serpent''
it'll turn on you
You'll be the first to be bitten
Are the Niyaz preparations over?
The only way Guddu will enter
this house in the evening...
is over my corpse
''Wait till it's dark, darling''
You remember the prayers by heart..?
''Yes, why ?''
Haven't seen you say
your prayers ever
You look like a child.
l am not assuming command by force
''Anyone wants to say anything,''
say it now
Kaka and Guddu
haven't come as yet
Talk about yourself
Look Miyan...
We all have faith in you
All of us
Palekar has been waiting
for this day
One misunderstanding amongst us
and the govt. will collapse
lf we stay together...
long live Maharashtra!
Turn that off
Relax dad! lts because of
you that l'm going. Get that!
''Now, go to the temple''
''And while you're at it, ask God''
to knock some sense in to you.
lsn't Kaka asking for a bit
too much today?
May God grant peace
to Jahangir Khan's soul
Wherever he may be..
may he accept our wishes
Miyan..!
Miyan.. at Kali's temple...
Before the mother goddesss...
Died before we could
reach the hospital...
Kept murmuring through the way..
Get me to the mansion
Who was it ?
- Who do you think it was ?
That bastard he'd brought up..
who else ?
Guddu..!
He'll not find
a place in hell
Take him away.. He's alive..
Take him away right now...
he's opening his eyes
Move it
He's dead Miyan..
He's dead..
Look..Kaka's dead.
Takes us for idiots..
Does anyone kill their own father ?
''Don't get worked up, Boti...''
everybody knows the truth
But till Bhosle's backing him..
nobody will raise his voice.
l wont dance like a eunuch
''at his court, understand!''
He killed my father
Don't get nostalgic about
your daddy.. or..
you'll see him before your time.
Where is Guddu?
Get in scum..
Where is Guddu?
- l don't know
Really...?
''- Really, l don't know''
''He's at Abdul Chacha's, isn't he ?''
At Mayman Mohalla..
Stop the van
Get off
Now run
''Come on, move''
Run..
Run...
Run...
Fire! Damn it.
Why did you let him go ?
lts critical to maintain the
balance of power in this world
Fire must fear water
''Salutations, O learned one..''
Did you miss your period
this month?
The chart shows that your stars
have entered the house of Jupiter..
Nobody..nobody
dare touch you
Except Guddu.
Find him!
Miyan!
You are on your way
to becoming a father
Congratulations Miyan !
Three months already
When was the last time
you slept with Jahangir?
lts yours Miyan.
l know its yours
l'll have an abortion if you want
Can't get Guddu out of your mind?
He's killed Abbaji...
our father..
''l give you my word,''
we'll get that bastard
l'll find an even better
match for you
Watch it..That's Venus..
have Mars instead
What the hell are you doing?
This is Saturn
What will it consume?
''- Here, this is mars..''
What if l swallowed saturn..?
''Men don't eclipse saturn,''
Saturn feeds on men...
''and these days, its famished''
Who does it want to swallow?
Who do you want eaten?
Where is Nasir's motel?
lf kababs are what you're after..
then l suggest you try out
''Abdul's inn, you wont regret it''
Without a skewer...
its impossible to roast kababs
And you obviously know where
the goats are chopped
and where the meat comes from ?
''Uncle, one plate roast chicken with..''
more chutney and less onion
Only Maqbool can foil this plan
Else l can topple this government
within 6 days
l'll have Bhosle dancing naked
in the parliament
What will we get in return?
lts me who's come asking
You cripple Maqbool
l'll start working on his head
Watch it man!
Miyan.. Miyan..
''Thana, Panvel, Kalba, Ambarnath''
each and every district has been
targeted
Tavde's dead too...
Who was it?
- Don't know yet. Bhosle's also...
Nimmi..
Bhosle's screwed. 15 of his party
members have gone missing
He's asked for you at once
Nimmi..
You handle it..l can't come now
Miyan..!
That whore will be the
death of us all
''What happened, Nimma?''
Doesn't let me sleep
Who.. ?

Don't harass my dear wife

like a good baby
He wont sleep
Keeps wailing all the time
Are you crazy?
You can hear it?
Yes.. l can hear it wail
all the time..
''After all, we killed it's father''
lt's father's alive
This baby is mine.
Understood... mine
They just got tired
working day in and day out
Nobody was forced
They deserve a proper rest..
vacation!
See how happy and fresh they look!
3 billion!
''Yes, 3 billion''
lf we are to save
this government..
we have to pay double
of what Palekar's offering
Chinna and Tavde are dead
lt'll take time to rebuild the family
lf Palekar comes to power...
you'll be the first
''into jail, remember?''
''But, how do l get 3 billion''
in three days time?
Go ask your darling wife..
''Watch that tongue, brother...''
Go and spew all this
bile where its needed
Miyan.. you here !
You should have
just called for me
Who has tried to mess
in Maqbool's domain ?
''l have no clue, Miyan, honest''
This guy just doesn't speak up
Who was he?
''- Honestly l don't know, Miyan..''
See.. l told you Miyan
wont spare me.
Tell me who..?
Let me ask him in
''front of you, Miyan''
Speak bastard..
speak up damn it...
Who was it ?
Miyan..Miyan..
We'll find out soon Miyan
Boti and Guddu are not kids
''lt's all the moon's fault, Miyan''
''No, it's all Abbaji's fault..''
he let Boti off to prepare
for Miyan's last rites
Everything has gone haywire
in the last two months..
There's supposed to be an eclipse
in three days time...
...as long as that passes
l need 3 billion..
..before your eclipse appears
How much..?
There hasn't been such
an eclipse for 80 years now
Many big boys drowned then
Will l sink or sail?
How can you sink Miyan ?
The police are with you.
Bhosle's backing you up
That leaves Guddu and Boti...
And if l don't bump them off
by tomorrow...
go ahead and banish me
Will l sink or sail?
''Now, if the sea comes up to your house,''
then you'll sink.. obviously sink..
The sea will come up to the house..?
Will it come walking or will
it be chauffeured in a car?
''Why, it can also take a plane.''
''it will visit the house,''
ring the bell...
ding dong..
ls Miyan at home?
- Who's there?
''Sir, it's me, the sea..''
have travelled from
afar to drown you
The sea will come to drown you
''Before it comes to you,''
you crash into the sea
Where in the world had you
run off to..rascal..?
Didn't even remember us
''for a day, did you?''
That girl is at the end
of her tether.. come in
what are you standing
outside for.. come
See.. your sweetheart's here
''Now, no more of that mad howling..''
''- Lay off, witch''
Why snap at me ?
You devoured my father's
''blood, you witch''
Sameera... the child will needlessly
die in the womb
''Anyway, you don't even deserve''
''to be called mother, whore !''
This area is under
my command for the next week..
Right from Kandla till..
about 30 nautical miles north
Money..?
- On delivery
The ball's in our court now...
''First swim on the high seas, then..''
we'll decide about the money
What..!
Nothing can be fixed
for the next 48 hours
lt's a miracle Sir.. considering how
precarious her condition was
Visitors are not allowed Sir
''No, let him go.. please..''
Where's daddy?
Hey man..
What the hell do you
think you are doing ?
Keep the child alive..
l'll come back for him
Why are you toying with her life..
what has happened?
The sea has come up to the house..
Ya.. tell me..
The boat has sunk
The government too
The customs guys are after my life.
- Then start running
You were a friend..brother
you were a friend
''Yes, Abbaji's''
We're still with you miyan..
Just let this eclipse pass..
then everything will be fine
''Hey, why did you let him off..?''
lts critical for the balance of power
Fire...
- Must fear water
The room's not been cleaned for ages..
See.. the blood has stained
all over the walls..
How will it come off now?
- Where...?
There...can't you see
Oh God ..even the sheets
haven't been changed..
Let me go...
These servants are
good for nothing...
who is supposed to look
after the cleaning up..
Let go Miyan...
The stench of blood is
''all over, let me wash it up''
lt will keep us up all night
''l'm going mad, aren't l?''
Tell me
l am going
''insane, aren't l?''
Aren't l?
Miyan....was everything a sin.. ?
Everything...?
''Our love was chaste,''
wasn't it..?
''Miyan our love was pure,''
wasn't it..?
Wasn't it Miyan..tell me..
''our love was chaste, right?''
Tell me.. Miyan..
''Our love was chaste, right?''
Tell me..
Tell me..
What the hell are
you two doing here ?
This area falls under
''our purview, Sir..''
''Come soon, Miya..its''
almost time for your flight..
Take care..
