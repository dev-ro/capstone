She's so pretty.
Ruka is like the very top
of the social food chain.
[Girl 2] I wish I had her legs.
[Girl 1] She could be a model.
[both] Right?
This is ridiculous,
they're clearly jealous of Ruka.
- [Suzu scoffs] Hiro.
- [Hiro] Mm.
And on top of that,
she's also got the qualities
of a natural born leader.
She's like the sun,
everyone revolves around her.
- So true!
- [laughing]
Yup, still annoying.
Lucky for you, you're like
the far side of the moon,
so ignored that people
forget you exists.
She's also hot like the sun too!
- [Suzu] Hiro.
- Huh?
[Suzu] Could you maybe cool it
with the commentary?
- [Kamishin] Join the Kayak Club!
- Huh?
Hey buddy, you
interested in kayaking?
[Boy] Whoa, back up Kamishin.
- Hey, how about any of you?
- [girls whining]
Impressive, starting the Kayak
Club all on his own like that?
Except he's the only member.
I wonder why.
What do you mean?
- Kayak!
- [girls scream]
Oh, hey!
- You wanna try kayaking?
- [Girl screaming]
[Kamishin] Where are you going?
Come back here.

he was a kid, right?
[clears throat]
And did you know,
that this one time,
Shinobu actually proposed to me.
[Hiro gasps]
Shut up, you're serious?
He said, "Suzu,
I'll protect you."
- When was this?
- We were six.
[Hiro sighs] That doesn't count,
you were babies.

happened years ago too.

[Woman] To jump into
the river like that,
it was like she

[Man] Trying to swim
in a raging river
is nothing like
swimming in a pool.
[Man 2] She died for
a stranger's child
and abandoned her own.
[Woman 2] I don't think
I'll be bringing my family
to play by the river anymore.
[Man 3] That's what happens
if you try to be a hero.

Good afternoon!
Hiro! [whimpers]
Guess what happened! Bell she...
I know. She made it on U's
Global Music Viral Hits Charts,
just as I expected she would.
No! That's not it!
She's being dragged like crazy!
Also as I expected. This is
typical internet behavior.
Hm. If you're only getting love,
you only have hardcore fans.
Not really famous.
If you want real stardom in U,
you gotta expect mixed opinions.
But half of them hate me!
I'm so dead!
So what? The other
half doesn't hate you!
Don't forget that.
Now what's the secret
to your success?
[Suzu] I look like Ruka.
[Hiro] And?
[Suzu] People do really cool
arrangements of my songs.
[Hiro] Um, what else?
You're my producer
and the costumes,
and the dances, and...
[Hiro] No!
Well I mean yes, but no!
The biggest factor
is that it's in U!
With its unique body
sharing technology,
U is able to draw out
a user's hidden strengths.
So without it,
you wouldn't be singing at all,
but instead depressed and
crying all the time, as usual.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
take a look at this.
[Suzu] "Who is Bell?"
No!
It's actually kinda funny
how totally wrong they are.
I mean, people are guessing
all these celebrities.
Couldn't be further
from the truth. [laughs]
This isn't funny!
Nobody in their right mind
would ever guess that
Bell's user is actually
a mousy nobody like you,
from some remote town.

You're scary.
[Hiro] This is more fun
than any video game.

[Hiro] They can't blame Belle.
It's that Beast guy's fault.
He deserves to be unveiled.
Why does he do stuff that
will make people hate him?
[Hiro] Oh, he probably thinks
he's being cool.
There's gotta be
a better reason.
[Hiro] He's just flexing.
You think so?
We should just find
out who he really is
and just unveil him ourselves.
Oh, hey Kamishin,
why the huge bag?
I've got an away match.
Woah! And I take it you do, too?
You and I are nothing alike.
{\an8}THE STRUCTURE OF U
The way it works is,
the AS is constantly in sync
with the user's biometric info.
It's how they prevent you
- from having two avatars.
- [Suzu] Oh.
I searched all over the internet
but there's no data
about the Beast's
nationality,
age or gender.
All I learned was that
he suddenly appeared
seven months ago.
So there's no way to find them?
Not the user.
But I did manage to
locate the records
of all his
past opponents.
Okay.
In total he's won 369 matches,
lost three and tied two.
Lucky for us,
most of his 374 opponents
have other public
social network accounts
linked to their U one.
We should track them down,
talk to them,
and see what they know.
[intense music]
[Suzu] "We will be using
the study room."
[gasps]
[Hiro laughs]
I have a question for any
of the Beast's opponents.
Who is he?
- It's a mystery.
- They're definitely not AI.
- Way too aggressive.
- Got a bad personality.
- Why does he act out?
- I have no clue.
I was one of the first
to fight them.
His back didn't have quite
as many bruises then.
So those are battle scars?
Question for those few of you
who have beat him before.
How were you able
to win the match?
Out of the blue,
he threw the match.
It seemed like to me
something distracted them.
[gasps]
The Angel!
[Hiro] Do you know something?
[both gasp]
[Hiro]
Someone must know something!
Come on, even a rumor?
- [Man 1] No clue.
- [Woman] Maybe it's this guy.
[Man 2] Oh yeah, him?
The bruises are similar.
[Hiro] Wait, who? Huh.
His name is Jellinek.
He's an obscure modern artist.
Six months ago,
he started getting tattoos
that look like bruises.
That's around the time
the Beast showed up.
And since then
his artwork's value
has increased twenty times.
[Suzu] That's suspicious.
[Hiro]
Oh! His agent's contact info.
We should call it!
What?! Are you serious?
I'm not talking.
[Hiro] Why the tattoos?
Who are you anyways?
[Hiro] Last night, where were
you and what were you doing?
[Jellinek] Why can't you all
just leave me alone?
- [Hiro] Why won't you answer?
- I'm done talking!
JELLINEK: EXIT
That guy is definitely
hiding something.
[tense music]
[Hiro]
Okay. Who else could it be?
[Man] Dunno.
But I know people like that.
[Woman] Oh, you mean
annoying people.
[Woman 2]
People who are always
claiming to be a victim.
[Woman 3] Oh yeah,
maybe it's her.
A woman?
On that day, I was
having a birthday party.
[Hiro] Oh, happy birthday!
No, it was for my husband.
Let me tell you,
it was a lot of work
but my daughters helped me
bake the cake at least.
[Hiro] Yeah I'm looking at
your Instagram right now.
You are?
[Hiro] You have
such a lovely family.
Oh, you are too kind!
Does that mean
I'll make it in your
"how to be
an ideal housewife" article?
Absolutely!
I'm sure my readers would
love to hear all your tips.
We'll reach out
to set it all up.
She doesn't really
seem like a bad person.
Are you kidding?
She was lying through her teeth.
And she doesn't have a family.
And that cake's store bought.
- Huh?
- [Hiro] The cameras outside
her home
have only captured Amazon
and Uber Eats deliveries
for months.
And all the pictures on
her social media
are actually stock photos.
Like this one.
This one, and this one.
[Suzu] I don't get it,
why would she do that?
[Hiro] No alibi. And aggressive.
Is her "They hurt me"
post about bruises?
She could very well
be the Beast.
[bat cracking]
Now there's a rumor going around
about superstar slugger Fox,
who played in this
year's World Series.
And word on the street is
that this baseball giant
has been hiding a rather
dark secret for years now.
- Go on.
- Well, some are claiming that
he is an extremely violent man
who's wearing
a gentleman's mask.
And that's the reason why you
always see him so covered up,
no matter what
the temperature is like outside.
[Host]
I guess every celebrity's
got a skeleton or two
in their closet.
Wouldn't be the first time
we were disillusioned.
Hello. My name is Gogo Doggo.
Mr. Reggsignation here.
- Have you heard yet?
- About what?
There's an AS that's
gaining popularity
among children right now.
- More popular than me?!
- Are you popular?
- Serious. Genuine question.
- No. No! Who is it?!
The answer is, the Beast.
I thought everybody hated him.
His hideout is this
place called The Castle.
Yeah, everybody's
searching U trying to find it.
What happens
when they find it?
I would take a selfie.
I would shake their hand.
But he's the bad guy.
That dude doesn't talk much.
Yeah, but I think that's
kinda cool though.
Isn't he scary though?
To me... the Beast...
He's my hero.
Hero.
Yeah. It's been the three
of us for awhile now.
It's been tough since
they lost their mom,
but at least they're happy.
We just take it day by day.
Enjoying the little...
[Suzu sighs]
Oh, yeah.
The two of us go way back.
We hit it off immediately!
Do you even know how
loaded that guy is?
Just click on the link
below if you wanna know
where his mansion's located.
[Man]
Wait, what? Who's this Beast?
[Woman] No seriously, who?
[Man 2]
I mean really, who is he?
[Man 3] Who the heck
do you think it is?
{\an8}MENU
[Hiro] Two rice dishes
with sides, Mrs. Tsuitsui.
[Mrs. Tsuitsui] Mmm-hmm.
What is wrong with you people?
it's not a publicity stunt.
It was a terrible accident.
And I'm still in mourning.
My art is a part of
my grieving process.
I put the tattoos where
my lover was scarred.
I guess it's true that everyone
is hiding some kind of secret.
You're too gullible.
He's only sharing the secret
in order to hide
an even bigger one.
You're too skeptical.
Of course I am. I have to be,
if we wanna find out what
he's really trying to hide.
What's wrong with secrets?
Everyone has them.
- You mean like you?
- You got secrets.
Who me?
I don't have any secrets.
Like the wallpaper on
your phone's lock screen.
Our physics teacher. Terada.
Shh, shh!
Don't talk about this in public!
Okay. Here.
Two rice dishes.
[Hiro] I'm nobody to him.
Another face
in a sea of students.
Just promise me you won't
tell my parents, okay?
They still think of me as
their perfect little daughter.
Your secret's safe.
If my mom found out,
she'd start foaming
at the mouth and die.
I mean just yesterday...
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
Really, I am.
Forget it. It's just that,
I guess I didn't realize that
you actually still talk
to your parents that much.
After Mom,
it's just me and my dad,
but we hardly ever talk
to each other at all.
I want you to know
I'll always be here for you.
[Man sighs]
It's crazy how long it's been.
- [Hiro munching]
- [Man] I'm thinking about
moving back in with the folks.
[Hiro] Now quit your moping
and eat already.
Hey, can I also get two
orders in noodles, please?
Sure.
[gentle music]
[Suzu] Are you sure
the castle's way out here?
[Hiro] I'm positive
I'm right this time.
[Suzu] Then why don't
you come with me?
[Hiro] Mr. Terada's teaching
a makeup class. Laters.
[Suzu stammers] Ugh.
[Mermaid 1] Are you
looking for something?
[Belle] Who are you?
[Mermaid 1] I am an AI.
I know everything.
[Belle]
I'm looking for a castle.
[Mermaid 1]
That's what I guessed.
[Belle] Uh, what?
What is this?
- [bright music]
- [birds chirping]
[Mermaid 2] Do you need help?
[Belle]
I'm looking for a castle.
[Mermaid 2] I figured as much.
I'll tell you, but only you.
[gentle music]
- [Mermaid 3] Do you need help?
- [Belle gasps]
You're looking for
the castle, right?
I'll tell you but you
must keep it a secret.
Wait! Uh, where am I?
I can't see a thing.
[Angel] Don't listen to them.
They were lying.
You'll never find them
like this.
Play with me instead.
Come, just follow the path.
[enchanted music]
[gasps] Woah.
Is anyone here?
- [Angel] Hurry!
- Oh.
[mermaids muttering]
[tense music]
[mermaids muttering]
- Pretty.
- I grew them.
They're secret roses.
Secret roses?
Why keep them a secret?
[Dragon]
What are you doing here?
[growling]
You are trespassing!
No, I followed the angel.
Then get out.
- But...
- [growling] Get out now!
Hold on.
I came here because
I wanted to ask you something.
Who are you really?
Please, just talk to me.
Leave...
or I'll bite your head off.
[Angel humming]
Where are you going?
[Angel humming]
Wait...
Wait.
[Angel] Trouble?
Are we in trouble?
No. You don't have to worry.
Everything will be okay.
Which side of you
is the real you? Which?
Come back!
Wait!
Suzu is in love.
With a bad boy, I bet.
I'm not! You're wrong!
Why say that?
[Nakai]
It's written on your face.
[gasps]
They can't resist
those bad boys.
I know I couldn't.
Tough on the outside,
soft inside.
And you think
"I can reform him", right?
- [women laughing]
- I already told you, I'm not!
[Hatanaka] Why don't you give
him a present to show you care?
During my senior
year of high school,
I studied abroad
for a while in Ohio.
And I met a guy there with
these razor sharp eyes.
But he was always
all by himself.
You mean like a lone wolf type?
What can I say?
I found it attractive.
So I decided to give him
a birthday present.
So what'd you get him?
- A song.
- [all] A song?
That's right, a song.
I wrote him a song and
then I sang it to him.
- [Yoshitani] That's so sweet.
- [Kita] A love song.
[Hatanaka] That's when I saw him
smile for the first time.
He told me it made him happy.
[Nakai] Did you guys go out?
- [Hatanaka] No.
- [Nakai] Why not?
[Hatanaka]
He was still in eighth grade.
[Okumoto] Eighth grade?
That was a twist
I didn't expect.
[Hatanaka] He came to
see me off at the airport
and actually cried.
It was really touching.
[Suzu] I've never tried
writing a love song before.

Huh...?
What?
So many texts?
[Girl 1] She and Shinobu
were holding hands.
- [Girl 2] What a show off.
- [Girl 3] Why her?
[Girl 4]
They're childhood friends.
[Girl 5] That's no excuse.
[Girl 6]
She's so full of herself.
Wha... what is this?
[tense music]
[phone ringing]
- [Hiro] Suzu!
- Hiro!
[Hiro] Did you ask
Shinobu out or something?
What? No!
- [Hiro] Did he ask you?
- Of course not.
[Hiro] What was it then?
[Suzu] So... our hands...
[Hiro] You held hands?
[Suzu]
No! He just grabbed my hand.
[Hiro] That's all?
But it's going viral.
Guess it shows
how popular he is.
'cause they're all
keeping tabs on him.
[Suzu]
But I didn't do anything!
[Hiro] Well everyone's
getting worked up over it.
This is clearly triggering
some unresolved issues.
I mean, the pettiness,
the name-calling,
not to mention the over-share.
So tense right now.
[Suzu] But I...
I thought they were all
supposed to be friends.
[Hiro] Guess it
takes real conflict
to know who your
true friends are.
This is gonna turn
into an all-out war
if they continue on like this.
[Suzu] What do we do?
[Hiro] I'll pinpoint
the biggest hotheads
to stop their rumors
from catching fire.
Suzu, you go talk some sense
into the reasonable girls.
[Suzu] I'll try!
Listen!
Nothing happened!
He'd never date me!
[Hikari] So true.
[Sana] We overreacted.
[Girl] Uh, can everyone
just like chill a little bit?
TRUCE
[Suzu grunts] I'm here!
Well, I managed to
put out that fire.
[Girls] Sorry.
People can be so heartless.
They only reacted this way
'cause you're such
a gloomy wallflower.
If it had been Ruka they
wouldn't have even cared
and life would've
gone on as usual.
Speaking of Ruka,
"I know this is sudden,
but are you free to talk now?"
The timing is odd.
Why would she text you
right at this moment?
[Suzu] What do you mean?
[Hiro] Maybe she
started the rumor.
[Suzu] She would never do
something like the that.
[Hiro]
She must be into Shinobu.
She's pretty. She doesn't
need to do that to get a guy!
[Hiro] I really can't stand
girls who act this way.
[Suzu] She probably
wants my opinion
'cause we grew up together.
[Hiro] I would ignore her, but
then again, I'm not that nice.
What do I do?
Kamishin's really committed.
[Shinobu] Yeah. He sure is.
- [Suzu] Shinobu!
- I've been here for forever,
just waiting for
him to wrap it up.
Hey, did something happen today?
You can tell me.
Well, actually there's something
I've been meaning to ask you
for kind of a while now.
Okay.
You see... well, it's, um...
I...
[Kamishin] Hey, Suzu!
You headed home?
I just finished
my practice laps.
Whew, I'm so wiped out.
Uh what's going on?
Uh Kamishin, uh yeah,
how did that away match go?
[Kamishin] Oh right!
Well, I went and competed.
But then guess what happened?
Okay. So I like,
traveled all this way.
Even took a bus overnight
'cause there's this recruiter
there I really wanted to impress
from this college
I had my eye on,
but I was way off my game and
got one of my worst times.
Oh, yeah.
Do you want to see a pic?
I guess it could've been worse.
I do feel guilty though.
You know, for the guys
who didn't make nationals,
You mean, you qualified
for the nationals?
[chuckles] I did.
Seriously?
That is so awesome!
I'm rooting for you!
You are?
- Shinobu?
- [Shinobu] Huh?
If she said she's going
to root for me then,
does that mean...
- [Shinobu] What?
- [clears throat]
Is this your way of telling
me you like me, Suzu?
Oh. Guess that's a no then?
That's what your
silence means, right?
Go put your stuff away already.
I was kidding, of course.
See ya later, Suzu.
Thanks for your support.
- [Shinobu] Just hurry it up.
- Yeah, yeah.
So uh... what was it
you wanted to tell me, earlier?
- Nothing.
- Did you forget?
[Suzu] It's no big deal.
- [Shinobu] You sure?
- I'm sure.
Listen...
you don't have to waste your
time worrying about me anymore.
[Shinobu] Huh?
Suzu!
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.
[inaudible dialogue]
RUKA
[Suzu panting]
I'M HERE FOR YOU.
THANKS, SUZU!
WHAT A SURPRISE.
I FEEL ENCOURAGED.
[Suzu whimpering and crying]
[somber music]
Who's that?
[music continues]
Bruises.
Get away.
I'm sorry, but your
bruises... they're...
You think they're ugly?
Is that it?
No! Are they painful?
I'm sure they are. I just...
You have no clue about anything.
Then why don't you
explain it to me?
[growls] Get out of here!
[Belle panting]
[mermaids chattering]
- [Man] You there!
- [gasps]
What are you doing over here?
Were you meeting
with someone?
For example,
an ugly monster?
[Belle gasping]
- [dramatic music]
- [Justices gasping]
Hold on.
You're Belle.
Why are you here?
Do you refuse to answer?
All right.
- Then tell me this...
- [Belle gasps]
What is your true identity?
There!
[Justice] It's him!
Let's get him.
[music continues]
- Look, he's scared.
- What a wimp.
[gasps]
[all yelling]
[glass shattering]
[whimpers] We're gonna crash!
[Justin] Where did
that monster go? Where?
Damn it.
[Dragon groaning]
Stay back.
Leave me alone.
[Dragon breathing deeply]
I think that I know you
a little better now.
This is where it
really hurts, isn't it?
You saved me back there.
Thank you.
[gentle music]
Belle.

Please?
[Hiro] "Isn't Belle doing
another concert?"
"Why won't she sing?"
This one says,
"She must be afraid.
It's because of the Beast.
Someone should unveil him."
[Suzu]
I'm gonna leave him alone.
Why do we need to know
his secret anyway?
[Hiro]
It's not up to us, though.
U isn't like a small group
text from class, you know.
{\an8}WHAT A SCUMBAG
Nobody can stop it.
[Woman] The AS commonly
referred to as the Beast
threatens order in U.
Contact us
with any information
with the hashtag
#UnveilTheBeast.
What do you wanna bet
he's some old shut in?
[Woman] They're like some
young gaming prodigy.
[Man] He's a she and
a really sexy one too.
[Man 2] I heard that
it's a billionaire.
[Man 3] Once they're unveiled,
I'm suing them for mental
distress from our match.
Jellinek, who is this?
Is this your new girlfriend?
- He is amazing.
- Look, I'm not dead, okay?
Oh, wait, she isn't?
I never said it was my
girlfriend who I was mourning.
Those tattoos were
to copy the Beast.
All of his art is plagiarized.
All she does is lie!
He's a con artist!
That loser
should just shut up.
- Excuse me?
- Plagiarize?
I would never do that.
I wanted to address
the rumors out there
that I'm harboring a secret
because I don't show my skin.
Why, just the other day, someone
in U was causing a scene,
accusing me of secretly
being the Beast.
But there isn't anything
villainous about me,
nor am I a violent man.
Now, it's always been important
for me to be a role model
and hero to the children.
I hope this isn't too shocking.
When I was little,
I had a lot of medical issues
and because of that, I needed
several major surgeries,
but I overcame these obstacles
and still managed
to play baseball.
So to all you kids
watching out there,
don't give up and
keep following your dream.
I hope you'll
receive this message
the way I sincerely
intended it.
[crowd cheering]
So then who's the Beast?
- [Woman] Unacceptable!
- Huh?
[Woman] Absolutely unacceptable!
I refuse to forgive
anybody who hurts me.
[Hiro] Wait, are you that
housewife I interviewed?
- Huh?
- Why are you a baby?
Uh, must be because I have such
an innocent and pure heart.
Oh, you wish.
You think if you act all cutesy,
then you can get
anything you want.
- [Hiro grunts]
- Shut up!
This is emotional abuse!
[Woman 2] Is it true
Belle's gonna sing again?
[Woman 3 speaks
foreign language]
[Man] It's just a rumor.
[Man 2] I heard it will be
an impromptu show.
[Woman 2] That can't be true.
[Man 3] But what if it is?
[Belle gasps]
Hey, wait, where did Belle go?
Belle?
Belle?
[ominous music]
[Justin] Do you understand
why this light
represents the power of justice?
Well, do you?
Normally, the biometric
information scanned by
your U device is converted
to the AS through
a specialized process.
But this light I carry
invalidates the conversion.
Exposing the user,
projecting them here in U.
This is how "unveil" works.
It means that I,
single-handedly,
have the same power that only
the Voices, U's creators, have.
Have you ever wondered why
I was given such power?
Or wondered why there are
no police for the Internet?
Why is it that there's
no law enforcement in U
when it's so much
like the real world?
It's a good question.
And everybody
wants the answer.
But the Voice insist
we already have
everything we need to
maintain a fair society.
But that is where
our perspectives differ.
And every society
has its villains:
those who like to cause trouble
and disrupt the order of things.
But they just do as they please
while scoffing at
the rest of the world.
We need the ability to
fight these scoundrels.
Justice is necessary,
no matter where we are.
In order to destroy evil,
you need power.
And that power
belongs to us!
The Beast...
The ugly Beast...
He must be unveiled in order
to maintain the integrity of U.
However, that said...
Why is it you are
always with the Beast?
I'm not.
Tell me where he is right now
or you will face
the consequences.
This is your last chance
to answer me.
I will unveil you right here
and now if you don't.
[ominous music]
I wouldn't tell you
even if I knew.
- What?
- You don't care about
maintaining justice,
you just want to
control people.
So I'm not telling you.
- [clangs]
- [Belle shouts]
Now you listen to me!
I am not going to let you
make a fool of me anymore.
If you think I won't unveil you,
you're sorely mistaken.
So why don't we take a peek?
I'm sure people would love
to know who's behind
the world-famous diva.
What the true face
hiding underneath
the beautiful mask
looks like.
I have a feeling it's nothing
like the one you wear in here.
Is it? [laughs]
When the truth is revealed...
what do you want to bet
no one will want to
pay any attention to a single
one of your songs anymore?
Huh?
So if you don't
want that to happen,
tell me where he is and
tell me who he is right now!
[Mermaid]
Are you looking for something?
Huh?
[Mermaid]
I'll tell you, but only you.
What's going on? [grunts]
Don't tell anybody else, okay?
[all laughing]
- Be gone!
- [mermaids scream]
[fire crackling]
[water splashing]
- You!
- [gasps]
[both grunt]
[chuckles]
- Thank you for saving me.
- [mermaids muttering]
I'm so glad you're okay.
[Suzu] He's in danger.
I can't abandon him.
I have to help him.
[Dad] Suzu.
[Suzu gasps]
Yeah, what?
You know, if you're ever in
some kind of trouble, you can...
- I'm not.
- I'm here if you are.
Everything is good.
I GOT PEACHES FROM SOMEONE AT WORK.
HAVE SOME. -DAD
Suzu.
Oh.
Hey, Ruka.
[Ruka] So, I bailed.
Your support gave me the courage
to at least go talk to him.
But when I was actually
in front of him, I just froze.
[Suzu] Hm-mm.
[Ruka] He looked at me and said,
"What's wrong with you?
You're creeping me out."
You're kidding!
But you can't really blame him.
It's my fault.
I was so insecure and
awkward, I was being creepy.
No, I don't believe it.
There's no way you
could have been.
Oh, Shinobu's such a jerk!
Oh, no, no, no, it wasn't him.
If not him then...
It's Chikami, yeah.
[Suzu] Chikami?
Chikami Shinjiro.
[Suzu] You mean Kamishin?
[Ruka laughs]
You're so cute!
- It's nice.
- [Suzu] Good.
Know what?
I think I figured out
who it is you like, Suzu.
Don't say it.
I'll die of embarrassment.
So uh, when'd it start?
[Suzu] When we were six,
he said, "I'll protect you."
And my kid brain thought it
was like a love confession.
But what he meant was that
he'd protect me from bullies.
He didn't mean anything
more than that, of course.
After my mom died,
I was always crying
and most of my
classmates avoided me.
He probably assumed I was
being bullied or something.
You know?
So this might sound
a little bit weird,
but I've often thought
that the way he's
constantly watching over you
and worrying about
you is like mothering.
- You think?
- Yeah.
When it comes to you,
he stresses over
every little thing
and is always
checking up on you.
Shinobu just isn't like
other high school guys.
[gasps] I said his name!
[laughs]
Ah, I'm dead.
[both laughing]
[Ruka] I'd love to see
that elementary school
you two went to.
- Let's do this again.
- [Suzu] Mm-hm.
[gasps]
Kamishin?
[gasps] You're here?
Oh!
I'm rooting for you.
- Who, me?
- Yes, you, you're great.
Is it true?
If she says she believes in me,
then does that mean...
Are you trying to tell me
that you have a crush on me?
No, wait, I was only kidding.
It was a joke, it was a joke.
What?
[gasps]
No, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!
Why are you running away?
[Kamishin] No girl's ever
said they liked me before.
[Suzu] She just said
she believes in you though.
[Kamishin] Good point.
[Suzu] So, doesn't
that make you happy?
[Kamishin] It does.
I... I...
- [gasps]
- [Suzu] Where are you going?
[Kamishin] I don't
know what to say.
[Suzu] Well, just say anything,
like "thank you" or
"I'll do my best."
Ruka?
- Yes?
- Uh...
What kind of stuff do you like?
Music. What about you?
What do you like?
I like Belle.
You like her?
I like her too.
[Kamishin] Really?
That's so cool.
[Ruka] I'd give anything
to sing like her.
You probably won't believe this,
but like people told me
that I look like her.
I totally see it.
You're just saying that.
I'm telling the truth.
You look a lot like her.
Hold up.
Are you related?
You know, my family goes
to Hakodate every summer
so we can visit my grandfather.
Which means if you
wouldn't mind it,
I could watch you
compete in nationals?
If you would come
to cheer me on,
then I would definitely win.
I know.
Mm-hm.
[sighs] That was close.
I hope it works
out for those two.
[Shinobu] Suzu.
- Seen Kamishin?
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-mm.
- [Shinobu] Which is it?
[Suzu] Mm-hm. Mm-mm.
Which one?
[cars whooshing]
Suzu, listen.
There's something I really
wanted to talk to you about.
Suzu, I...
Wait, wait, wait, I'm sorry.
Me too. I mean, I also
have something to tell you
if that's all right.
Okay.
It's that I, uh...
- I already know.
- So the thing is, I'm...
Suzu. You're Belle, right?
[Suzu gasps]
In U, you're Belle, am I right?
Suzu?
You're wrong!
- What?
- [cars whooshing, honking]
It's not true!
Huh?
Suzu, where'd you go?
Suzu!
[Suzu wailing]
What do I do now?
How will I ever tell him?
[phone vibrating]
- Huh?
- [Hiro] Suzu,
the Beast is in trouble!
[dramatic music]
[Man] His castle...
[Woman] Finally.
[Man 2] They actually found it?
[all shouting]
We will show him no mercy.
We'll unveil the Beast and
reveal their true identity.
[Justices grunting]
Today, in front of
everyone in U,
we shall make him
pay for all his sins!
[beeping]
[Man] They're finally
going to unveil the Beast.
[Woman 2] Wow,
who do you think it is?
[Man 3] That's the big question.
[Man 4] I heard a rumor
that he's a psycho killer.
[Man 5] I heard a crooked
businessman who evades taxes.
[indistinct chatter]
[Man 6] The Beast is
a waste of space.
[Woman 3] Who needs him?
[Man 7]
I, for one, won't miss him.
[Man 8]
He deserves to be hunted!
Hey, Beast, you watching this?
- No way. I doubt it.
- All the kids around
the world, they're out there
cheering you on,
and lemme guess,
you're not watching, are ya?
The Beast is being bullied
by the adults!
I feel so bad.
Someone should
help him now!
Everyone, let's show
the Beast we care!
What are you doing? Help him!
Cheer the Beast on.
Look at these idiots.
Their viewer counts are
only in the single digits.
They got like zero clout.
- They're just try-hards.
- Wannabes!
[Hiro]
Meet me at the old school.
Okay.
[panting]
[phone chimes]
[Belle gasps]
[dramatic music]
What happened?
Please, protect our master.
You have to.
When they refused to tell us
where the Beast is,
these are the consequences.
You're cruel.
How could you?
What do I care?
They're just AI.
[Belle gasps]
I couldn't find him.
It's fine. Let's go.
We'll just burn down
this castle.
What do you want to bet
that he'll come scurrying out
like the vermin he truly is?
[chuckles]
Behind you, look.
I'll tell you, but only...
[bricks clattering]
[Belle panting]
[Dragon groaning]
[Belle gasps]
It'll be okay. Stay calm.
Hang in there. Don't worry.
We'll leave together.
[Dragon]
Everything is going to be fine.
I just have to endure this.
Endure?
Belle, I can't
tell you the truth.
Sorry.
Wait! Don't go!
[somber music]
[flames crackling]
[glass shatters]
[rumbling]
Hey, Shinobu.
- Have you seen this yet?
- Hm?
[Kamishin] Some crazy stuff's
going down in U.
- [Shinobu] Suzu.
- [Kamishin] Suzu?
Do you have any
idea where she went?
[Kamishin] No.
[Ruka] Well, we were
just talking earlier
and she said something about
your old elementary school.
Is that near here?
Uh, Shinobu?
Wha... Ruka, wait! Uh...
Suzu, you're late.
Sorry.
[Hiro] I'm currently
auto-searching
anything that might be related.
We have to find his identity
before Justin figures it out.
How will we do that?
How are we supposed
to find one person
out of five billion accounts?
- It's impossible.
- Where is he?
Hey, where did he go?
Where are you?
Did anyone see him?
Look, it's Belle!
- It's Belle?
- Seriously?
I knew she'd come back.
[indistinct chatter]
[Belle] No, stop!
I'm looking for someone.
Let me go, please!
[indistinct chatter]
[Man] Belle's gonna sing again!
[Woman] The rumor
was true, she's back!
[Man 2] Belle, we've
been waiting for you.
[Girl] I wanna hear Belle sing!
[Girl 2] Sing for us,
sing already!
[Hiro] Everyone,
we're running out of time!
You need to let Belle go now!
She's surrounded.
This is bad.
But if we go now,
then she'll figure out...
That we knew this entire time.
However, we should still go.
I'm begging you, let Belle go!
[Suzu] Come on, think.
Who could it be?
Who is he, really?
Emotional abuse!
[Suzu] Is he like that woman?
Is he lonely,
like she is?
Then again...
[Jellinek] I put the tattoos
where my lover was scarred.
[Suzu] But his bruises
are real, not art.
[gentle tense music]
- [bat cracks]
- [grunts]
When I was little,
I had a lot of medical issues...
[Suzu] And they didn't seem
like surgical scars either.
If the U device scanned him
for traces of physical pain,
then... then his real body
might also
be covered in bruises.
But why were
his bruises throbbing?
And his eyes.
When I looked in them,
they reminded me of a child.
[gasps] A child!
[child humming]
[Suzu] That kid's voice!
Huh?
[Suzu] That's my song.
We're the only two that know it.
There, find out who's
singing that song!
- Is she okay?
- [Suzu] Where are you?
Come on, where are you?
[child singing]
♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪
♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪
♪ La, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la ♪
[gasps]
[Suzu] That kid,
I recognize him.
To me...
the Beast, he's my hero.
It's been tough since
they lost their mom,
but at least they're happy.
- [child continues singing]
- We just take it day by day,
enjoying the little
things in life.
We support each other...
[Suzu] How does
he know this song?
I'm gonna zoom in.

♪ La, la, la ♪
♪ La, la, la ♪
[Suzu gasps] It's Belle.
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la ♪
[Hiro] So does that mean
this kid's the Beast?
[Suzu] Something's off.
What do you mean?
I can't explain why,
but I don't think it's him.
Me neither,
and I didn't see any bruises.
- [banging]
- [gasps]
♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪
Tomo.
What is that you're singing?
I'm trying to focus
on my work.
I can't do that when
you're making a ruckus.
[Tomo singing softly]
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la ♪
[glass crashes]
Why don't you ever
listen to anything I say?
The world is full of rules
that everyone has to follow.
And in this house,
I make the rules.
If you can't follow them,
what's going to
become of you, huh?
Are you listening?
Do I have to repeat myself?
Do you need to be
taught a lesson?
- [Suzu gasps]
- [Boy] Stop it!
Tomo didn't do anything wrong.
Move it!
Please don't!
[Man] How dare you?
Now move!
Tomo, don't listen.
[Man] If I can't work,
how am I supposed
to provide for you?
All of this is my fault, okay?
It's not yours.
[Man] You're already 14, Kei.
You should know better!
I'll be here to protect you.
[Man] How will you ever be the
man of the house like this?
- Huh?
- There, there,
it'll all be okay.
[Man] If you guys don't want
to listen to me, then leave.
- Get out of here!
- [Kei sobbing]
[Man] Go on, just, just leave!
[Kei groaning]
I just have to endure this.
This boy.
He's the Beast.
It's him.
Look.
Huh?
[door shuts]
How could he?
There's no excuse.
Hey, Kei, are you all right?
I see.
I think I get it now.
Kei wanted to be a hero so
he could be there for Tomo.
Kei?
[Hiro] Look at the situation
they're in.
This is why the Beast
is so strong.
Since U's
body sharing technology
reveals the hidden you,
enduring all this pain must
be the source of his strength.
It's not unlike how
Suzu became Belle.
[melancholic music]
ACCEPT
[Computer] Connected.
[Suzu] Hello?
Can you see me?
Can you hear my voice?
Um, I saw what happened.
Don't... don't worry.
Everything's going to be okay.
Can...
Can I come and see you?
Just tell me where
you are and I'll...
Oh yeah?
- Who are you?
- [both gasp]
He's never met you in real life.
[Suzu] I'm Belle.
- Belle?
- Yeah, sure you are.
[Computer] Connected.
[Man] See, what'd I tell you?
[Man 2] Better call the cops.
[Man] Straight up child abuse.
[Man 3] We could totally do that!
[laughs]
[click, dial tone]
Are you also
the kind of person
who laughs at others' pain?
- [Suzu] No.
- How was it?
Did you have fun watching
how miserable we are?
[Suzu] No!
You're wrong.
I... I wanted to help
you in some way.
That's actually
why I called you.
I just want to help.
Help us by doing what?
"I'll help you, I'll help you,
I'll help you."
I've heard it so many times.
"Let me talk to your father,"
or "I've already
talked to your father,"
or "I think that I got
through to your father,"
but nothing ever changes.
"I'll help you, I'll help you,
I'll help you."
Is that so?
How exactly will you help?
"I'll help you,
I'll help you, I'll help you."
What the hell do you know?
"I'll help you, I'll help you,
I'll help you."
Those words are
easy for you to say.
Everyone's always
saying the same thing.
"I want to help you,
I want to change things,
I want to make it better.
I'll help you,
I'll help you, I'll help you."
You just repeat it
out of sympathy.
In the end, it doesn't
change one little thing!
"I'll help you, I'll help you,
I'll help you.
I'll help you, I'll help you,
I'll help you, I'll help you!"
Shut up already
and leave us alone!
[Suzu gasps]
[shouts]
- Kei, wait, come back!
- You're disconnected.
Please, Kei, where are you?
He isn't going to tell you!
Why should he?
He has no reason to trust you.
So what do we do now?
There's one thing you can do,
- sing.
- [gasps]
[Man] Everyone,
make room for Belle!
[crowd chattering]
Mark my words,
her song will draw him out.
He'll show up for her,
just like he did before.
I know he will.
[crowd chattering]
Don't do it as Belle.
You need to do it as Suzu.
- It's the only way.
- What?
Have you gone totally insane?
We need some way to
get his attention
and this is how we do it.
Do you know what you're saying?
Do you know what happens
if she does this?
It means it's the end
of everything Suzu and I
have worked so hard for.
But you need to gain his trust
and this is the way.
Suzu, think about why
you've been doing all of this.
Do you really want to
go back to the old you?
Back to crying all the time,
is that what you want?
You don't want that, do you?
[Suzu crying]
Though you didn't mean to do it,
you unveiled him
to the entire world.
So if you keep on
wearing a mask,
how do you expect to
actually help him?
And how are you supposed
to connect with him
if you won't even show him
your true self?
[crowd chattering]
Damnit! Why isn't she singing?
Come, on!
[whooshing]
Sing now!
Sing so we can draw out
your precocious beast.
Sing to him!
What are you doing?
- Use your light on me.
- What?
Your light!
I want you to use it on me.
[light whooshing]
What's that?
Are you crazy?
If I do that, you'd be unveiled.
No one wants that!
[mysterious music]
[crowd shouting]
[crowd shouting]
What is happening?
It can't be. Is that Belle?
- She looks so different.
- Except they both have freckles.
[Woman] Belle was unveiled?
[Man] Who unveiled her?
[Man 2] She did it herself.
[gasps] This is bad!
Why did someone
unveil Belle?
Weren't you listening?
She did it to herself.
- [Man 3] She did? But why?
- [Woman 2] Yeah, what for?
That's Belle?
She's just an ordinary girl.
[crowd chattering]
This whole time,
she was just like me.
[gasps] We worked so hard
to keep this all a secret!
[Shinobu] Do you have the music
streaming app on here?
- [gasps] You can't!
- Suzu.
["A Million Miles Away"
by Belle]
[Girl] She's gonna start!
It's time to sing.
She can't do it!
That's why she needed
a different persona!
She can.
But what if she fails?
- Poor thing.
- Oh, Suzu.
- Come on.
- Suzu.

Um, Belle?
You there?
Are you there?
- [Woman gasps]
- [Tomo] Can you see us?

You reached them by
being your true self.
Shinobu.
Thank you!
I'm so relieved!

Huh?
[glass shattering on recording]
[Man on recording]
Why don't you ever listen
to anything I say?
[Man] What the hell is this?
All right, our address is...
[Tomo gasps]
Are we doing this again?
- [Kei] No.
- Kei, cut it out!
- [Kei] Stop.
- Move it!
- [Tomo] Kei!
- You too!
Get outta here!
[all gasp]
[beeps]
[Kita] Those two kids
are in danger.
[Yoshitani] Something
has to be done.
[Okumoto] But where are they?
We never got the address.
[Ruka] I think I have an idea
on how to figure it out.
- [all gasp]
- Earlier, over the video call,
I heard the evening
broadcast chimes.
You did?
First was "The Sunset Glow"
and then later "The Coconut."
Those get played
during the daily PSA's.
It's usually one.
Then they must be in
between two other cities.
But which ones?
[Shinobu] I'm looking it up.
I have a recording from earlier!
[whirring]
[chimes playing]
[Nakai] She's right.
[Kamishin] Whoa,
Ruka's got some sharp ears!
[Okumoto] Hey, look at
the window.
Can you zoom in?
[Nakai] What are those,
high-rises?
[Kita] Luxury condos?
[Hatanaka] Hang on,
there's two of them.
But where?
We have to find out.
I know, but we need more info.
Hey. Hm. Mm. [gasps]
Ruka! I actually think I might
know where that is!
- [all] Huh?
- Hang on.
Okay, um, where was that?
Hurry it up!
- I found it.
- Where is it?
[Shinobu] Out of
the five condos in Tokyo,
the ones with two
tall buildings are
between the Ota District
and Kawasaki City.
Is this it? Look!
It's matching all
the criteria. I think we got it!
- Nice work.
- Yeah!
- Yes!
- [laughs]
Hello? I need you to
do a wellness
check on a couple of children.
I don't have an address,
but I can give you
the neighborhood.
Huh?
Why can't you do anything?
It's the law?
You have to wait 48 hours?
But what if something
happens before then?
I have to go.
Suzu!
I'll drive you to the station.
Suzu!
[both panting]
[engine revving]
There are no more
flights to Tokyo.
And driving will take too long.
Will she be okay on her own?
I think that she's going to be.
[Suzu] Sorry I left without
saying anything, Dad,
but I needed to go somewhere.
[Dad] I received a message
from the choir ladies.
[Suzu] And I'm sorry
I've been so selfish.
[Dad]
Don't worry, I trust you.
[Suzu] Someone important
to me is in trouble.
[Dad] So you're doing
this to help somebody.
[Suzu] But I don't know
what to do.
How do I help them?
[Dad] You've...
You've been so sad ever
since your mom died.
I can see
that you're suffering.
Life's been tough for you,
but at the same time,
you've grown up to be
such a caring person.
You relate to and understand
what people are feeling.
Suzu, I think...
you are so kind
because of the way
Mom raised you.
So just keep on
being that kind girl.
THANKS

you would show up.
I've wanted to meet you,

Same with me.

After watching you stand up
for what you believe in,
it was at that moment
I knew what to do
and that's why
I'm going to fight.
You know what?
I learned from you too.
Because of you, I found
strength I didn't know I had.
I'm finally free.
Thank you.
You're my hero, Belle.
Thanks for that.
Yeah, Belle, you're great.
You're amazing.
And I think you're beautiful.

[Kita] Oh, great idea.
Lord knows we need the practice.
[Hatanaka] Oh, right,
the concert.
What should we sing?
[Kita] I think
it's pretty obvious.
[Yoshitani] Of course, that one.
Suzu!
Huh?
[Yoshitani] Will you
sing the lead?
[all] Yes, sing!
Uh, huh?
You can do it.
Hm.
Great, ready?
