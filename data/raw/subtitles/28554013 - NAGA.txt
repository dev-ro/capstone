He went to the grocer's,
and he'll be back very soon.
[woman] Been ready for half an hour.
[mother, wryly] Sorry for being late.
We were in the ER. [sighs]

- You have time.
And I'll send you a nice picture
of your brother to use, okay?
They don't do that anymore.
Don't you remember Um Mishary's huge cake?

-You will surely sigh
-[man 2] Sigh
[man 1] A mere touch from me
-You'll feel the pain
-[man 2] Pain
[man 1] Persist, and your effort
-Will be in vain
-[man 2] Vain
[man 1] We once gave you gifts
A child enchanted
-Today, you flaunt strength
-[phone rings]
-So undaunted
-[call disconnects]
[man 1] Tread carefully
For the wolf draws near
He will shatter your hopes
-Make peril clear
-[man 2] Wow, very good!
[father] A real poet.
He speaks from the heart.
[man 2] It's the match tonight.
It's very important.
I'm sure you've prepared
the poem for the national team.
[Sarah] Dad, can you pick me up
at 11 instead of nine?
[man 1] I do have one.
But I'd rather present it after they win.
- [father clicks tongue]
- [man 2] Shall I consider this a promise?
If the national team wins,
I'll call you myself from the studio.
[man 1] Yes, call me and be optimistic.
[man 2] Good. Abu Fahad is optimistic.
We'll look forward to hearing your poem.
[Sarah] What about ten?
[father, gruffly] Uh...
[indistinct, distant chatter]
[Sarah] Here. That's her, Dad.
1:00 P.M.
[clock chimes]
[father] 9:59 exactly.
Be ready. Not a minute later,
not a minute earlier.
[Sarah, flatly] God willing.
[somber string music playing]
- Sorry. We had coffee without you.
- [Sarah] It's fine.
Mom is annoying me.
She's more worried about my wedding
than I am. As if it was hers.
[motor reverberating in distance]
[friend] I don't blame her.
We have a lot to do for the wedding.
We still need perfumes.
And we need the rest of the cloth.
[muffled] Wow. Look. It's really pretty.
- [music cuts out]
- Careful.
[Sarah] Sorry.
- Look, I can use this for pillowcases.
- [Sarah] Yeah.
Did you even see it?
Touch it. [clicks tongue]
- [Sarah] It's nice but rough.
- [friend] Because it's grand.
- Excuse me.
- [seller] Hello.
- [friend] How much is it per meter?
- [seller] 360.
[friend] Why is it so expensive?
[seller] It's silk. Italian silk.
- No, thanks.
- [seller] Ask other vendors.
- What's that?
- [Sarah] Could you bring a cake for Fahad?
He hurt his eye,
and Mom wants to cheer him up.
I see. You're going through with it?
[Sarah] Yes. Didn't we agree?
That you go and leave me,
not treat me as a servant.
Oof. I'm fed up.
[Sarah] Don't make me beg
when I've carried your bags
for the last two weeks
without complaining.
- So you don't want to help me? Fine.
- [Sarah] What do you mean?
You left me behind
in sophomore year to rot in the sun.
Your mom yelled at me.
Sophomore year? You never forget.
You are so spiteful and mean.
[Sarah] How many times
have I told you not to call me that?
[friend] I'm sorry, but it's true.
If someone once wrongs you,
you hold a grudge forever.
[tense string music playing]

I didn't see you. I'm sorry.
[vendor 4] Come and see what we have!
[man 1] This one is yours.
- Shut up.
- [man 2] Calm down, man.
Abu Mishary, forgive him.
- Listen. Don't talk.
- For my sake.
- Please. Let's stop fighting.
- That man got me.
- [grunts]
- Pay it no heed.
[Abu Mishary] Look what you've done!
My blood pressure!
- You're a headache!
- [man 2] Seriously!
[man 1] Every day, you say,
"The electrician will come tomorrow."
We're suffocating.
We've been breathing
this gas for a week! Enough!
[Abu Mishary] What do you want me to do?
I told you the shop is closed.
The guy got busy.
You want me to kill him, or what?
- [man 1] Sort it out.
- [Abu Mishary] How?
- [man 1] I'm losing customers.
- [Abu Mishary] The handyman doesn't show!
Take it easy, Abu Samy.
It could be a blessing in disguise.
- You never brought me anything good.
- It is a blessing.
- Believe me.
- [Sarah] Is the shop closed?
[calmly] Sure. Sorry. I'll open later.
- [Sarah] Ugh. When will you close?
- [Abu Samy] 9:30 p.m. God willing.
- [Sarah] I'll come at nine.

The henna on your hand is pretty.
It reminds me of my grandma.
May she rest in peace. [exhales]
Did you bring it?
Where?
- [boyfriend inhales]
- What's that?
- Trust me.
- [Sarah] What do you mean?
Abu Kholoud mixed it with the tea.
[Sarah] Why?
What do you mean? It's the good stuff.
- Is he still with that crazy woman?
- [boyfriend] Yes, he is.
They might go with us to the camp.
- [Sarah] What?
- We're going to a camp.
A camp? A camp in the desert?
No. A camp in the road.
It's far. No.
- No, no, no.
- [mockingly] No, no, no.
Just listen.
It's not just the camp.
I swear, I've never seen anything
like this in my life.
- Yeah. Whatever.
- [boyfriend] I'm serious.
You want me to get slaughtered

Three people stopped me on my way here
to ask me to buy it, and I refused.
Swear we'll be back before nine.
[boyfriend] We won't be late.
I swear. We'll be back before nine.

Abu Nayef, from the camp.
He said he would send me the location,
and he still hasn't.
I'm not sure
if he fell asleep or something.
[Sarah] That's fine.
I don't want you
to waste your time for nothing.
[Sarah] That's fine.
I'm here for you,
not Abu Nayef or Abu shit.
Are you shy?

It's okay if you've changed your mind.
- No. It's okay.
- I mean it.
Me too.

It never made me pass out.
Can you drive safely?
Yes, yes. Don't worry.

That's the second time
I've heard that today.
"A blessing in disguise"?

[seller] Be patient, please.
- [lighter clicks]

- It's fire, man. [laughs]
- Fire! Hey!
- Hey! Out! Stay out!
- [punk 2] What do you think?
- Huh?
- Stay outside. No, no, no, no, no.
- What's this? It's fire!
- Out! Out! No!
Out! Out!
- I said open up.
- [window opens]
- [seller] It's dangerous! Don't do that!
- He's Muslim, man. What's wrong with you?
- [seller] Out!
- Open up, man!
- He's a customer. What's the problem?
- I said, "Out." No fire!
- No fire!
- [punk 3] He's a customer.
What do you mean, "no"?
We're only having some fun.
- I want ice cream. Now.
- [seller] What is that?
- [punk 3] He's not listening to me.
- [punk 1] Come inside.
We can't? What do you mean, "We can't"?
[punk 1] Oh wow! Come in, man! Come in!
Wow! Come on!
- Too much ice cream, man!
- [seller] Leave the machine, guys!
[punk 1] Listen to me.
You can't do anything.
- [seller] Enough! Enough, guys!
- Eat some, man!
That's nice ice cream, isn't it?
[indistinct shouting continues]
[punk 2] We want ice cream. [laughs]
[chanting] We want ice cream.
- We want ice cream.
- Have you seen a wild camel?
- Huh?
- Hellooo?
Do you have... a light?
[indistinct shouting continues in truck]
[punk 2] Set them on fire!
Set them on fire!
Sure?
[punk 1] Do you have vanilla ice cream?
I don't like chocolate ice cream!
Do you have vanilla?
[shouting continues]
[punk 2] Come on.
Let's go. May Allah forgive him.
- [quad engines start]
- [man] May God protect you.
[radio blasting]
[punk 1] Whoo-hoo-hoo!
[punk 2] Whoo-hoo!
[punk 1] Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
You are the wild camel on the run.
[clicks tongue] I need to ask,
why are camels called spiteful?
Um... because if you hit them,
they remember.
I thought it was more of a metaphor.
How would I know?
- [cell phone vibrates]
- [Saad gasps]
- Yes! Got the location.
- Huh?
Abu Nayef sent me
the location of the camp.
Are you serious?
It's too late. We can't go now.
No, it's very close.
- Ten minutes away, maximum.
- Even if it's two minutes, no.
Don't be such a boring toad.
- Boring toad?
- Yeah.
I mean, we already came such a long way.
The least we can do
is go and see the damn place.
[engine puttering]
6:00 P.M.
[clock chimes]
[Sarah] Don't say we're lost.
Saad, let it go and let's head back.
I wanna go back.
What's wrong? Don't worry. We're not lost.
But Google Maps is never accurate.
It's the fences.
I'm sure we're near the camp.
Put some music on and chill.
- [Sarah] Watch out! [screams]
- [camel groans]
[brakes screech]

[Sarah breathing shakily]

What kind of idiot are you?
Can't you see?!

Open the damn window!
Open it, or I'll break it!
- [window squeaks open]
- [tense music playing]
- [Saad] I'm sorry.
- What do I do with your "sorry," then?
What will your "sorry" do
if you hit my herd, asshole?
Answer me!
- [Saad] Okay. Calm down.
- Don't you dare tell me to calm down!
- Calm down.
- [herder] Don't tell me to calm down!
Why are you here? What are you doing here?
- [Saad] We got lost.
- What the hell are you looking for?!
- [Saad] We got lost looking for a camp.
- Camp? What do you mean, camp?
Why are you here now?
[Saad] Abu Fahad's camp.
[tense music fades]
[calmly] Abu Fahad's camp?
These are all his.
- Blessings upon both of you.
- [Saad] Yeah.
My apologies, brother.
May Allah be with you. [sighs]

- Abu Nayef, you screwed us up!
[Abu Nayef on speaker] Man,
if you saw how hectic things are here.
Everyone is bringing their friends.
Okay, I'm here.
Yes, yes. I see you.
- You're in your old man's car?
- [Saad] Yeah.
- He doesn't know I took it.
- Your dad is wilder than you.
Park, park.
- [ethereal music playing]
- [car alarm chirps]
Do you know him?
[Abu Nayef] You got here
at the right time.
There'll be a lot of fun.
There'll be dancing and music,
and we have a singer.
- Who?
- The one and only Shabah Bisha.
You haven't!
[quietly] Yes. I kept it low-key
so we don't get a crowd here.
You have a plus-one?
- [clears throat] Welcome. Welcome.
- [Saad] Thank you.
Come.
- [Sarah] Plus-one?

Why aren't you picking up?
I kept calling you, and you didn't answer.
Sorry, Mom. My phone was on mute tonight.
I didn't notice.
I was worried sick.
[sighs] How are you, my child?
All is good, Mom.
And how's Hadeel? Are you done shopping?
[hesitates] No, we're still shopping.
Uh, Mom, Hadeel is calling me.
Did you get the cake?
- Yes, I'll pick it up at nine.
- Good.
Your dad will pick you up at ten.
- Don't keep him waiting. He's tired.
- [rustling]
[mother] And listen,
if you're close to Al Hamood,
can you get half a kilogram of cashew nuts
and half a kilogram of salted seeds?
God willing.

Sorry.
Isn't that Abu Kholoud's girlfriend?
That's strange. Where could he be?
[epic hip-hop playing]
[Saad] Recognize him?
Abu Fahad Hamad Al Waswas.
The famous poet.
[flatly] That's him?
I've never seen him before,
but Dad loves him.
- Don't know why.
- [Saad] Please.
He's considered a genius. A professor.
- [Sarah] The nose of a professor.
- [Saad] A history professor.
[music ends]
Why's he here?
Why? The whole event is organized for him.
Yesterday, he won Poet of Najd. Amazing.
Oh. There he is. Finally.
Hey!
Just a second.
Would you like tea, coffee, or water?
[intriguing music playing]
[man 1] Guys, you need to listen to me.
[indistinct chatter]
[excited chatter]
[man 2] A cup of tea, Mohammed. Hey!
Hello! Where's your car?
I didn't see it outside.
- I came in my cousin's truck.
- [kisses]
- It doesn't even start.
- At least I have a car.
- [tapping on microphone]
- [entrancing string music starts]
[Shabah Bisha singing in Arabic]
[electric lights thrumming]
[audience singing along]
[guy 1] What's wrong?
Want some?
No, thank you.
Don't be shy.
[guy 2] Don't be pushy.
[guy 1] I'm not being pushy, dude.
It's called hospitality.
What's up, uh, sweet smile?
[guy 1 grunts] Shut up.
[guy 2] You know what?
I never saw meat and dancing together.
Meat? Have some respect.
[guy 2] Oops. She's gone.

This is not a place for you.

[Sarah panting]
[eerie music playing]
[man] Yeah? What happened next?
[Abu Kholoud's girlfriend] Hey, Soso!
What's wrong with you?
[laughs]
- You see the guy I was with?
- No. He's left you behind.
[phone powers down]
[girlfriend] Girl, what a cool shirt.
[sighs] You have a Samsung charger?
[girlfriend] It's too noisy.
Check here,
but I don't think you'll find one.
[live percussion music continues
in distance]
- [footsteps approach]
- [girlfriend screams]
- What's wrong?
- Put him on the table.
[injured man moaning]
Careful, careful.
Hold his head from the back.
Take care. Slowly.
[man 1] Yes. Lift his arms.
- Slide him.
- Lift him up a bit.
[man 1] Enough.
Uh, what's wrong? What happened to him?
[man 2] I have no idea.
We found him like this.
And half the sheep, the same.
- Adham, say nothing to Abu Fahad.
- [man 1] First aid kit.
- [Adham] We won't tell Abu Fahad?
- The first aid kit.
- [Adham] If he says something?
- [man 1] He won't.
[man 2] We need to cure him.
[herder moans]
- [man 1] Bring it. Quickly.
- [Adham] God!
[man 2] We won't say a thing.
Be patient. Pass the water.
Please. Please.

- [music cuts out]
- [girlfriend screams]
Uh, animal guts don't make me sick.
- [Sarah] Have a Samsung charger?
- What's the problem?
The problem is
that her dad will make trouble.
Do you have a Samsung charger
so she can get home?
Maybe. There might be one around here.
[girlfriend] She's scared.
Her dad is ruthless.
[scoffs] Your dad really is scary.
If I were you, I'd be terrified.
But on a serious note,
is that thing behind your dad's ear
because of the incident?
[Sarah sighs]
[nurse] No, Doctor.
Her husband's angry
because he only wanted a female doctor.
[doctor] This was an emergency.
He was the one who brought you
to a hospital full of male doctors.
[shooter] I didn't want him
delivering my baby!

- Huh?
[mocking] "Huh?"
[girlfriend] What do you mean exactly?
Are you kidding?
Everyone was talking about it back then.
It's not my fault.
And we were just kids.
We talked about everyone then.
[hocks, spits]
Right back at you! What?
- Just piss off.
- You piss off! You're spiteful.
What a drama queen!
Drama!
- [waiter] What a load of nonsense.
- Uh, excuse me.
- A Samsung charger?
- Huh?
- Samsung charger.
- Check over there.
- [girlfriend] My heart is beating fast.

[Sarah panting]
- [sounds distort and echo]

- [woman 1] What?
- [man 1] We have to do something.
- [woman 1] Take her!
- [clamoring]
- [woman 1] Is she gonna be okay?
- [woman 2] Reem?
- [clamoring continues]
- [woman 2] Reem?
- [woman 1] An hour to get some water?
- [woman 2] Oh my God.
- [man 1] Tissues, please.
- [waiter] I don't know. She went that way.
- [man 1] Can't you find tissues?
- [clamoring]
- [man 2] You need to help me.
- [man 3] Take care.
- [woman 2] Reem! Reem! Reem!
That's the girl who was with her.
- Are you sure?
- [waiter] I swear.
Guys, water, quickly!
- [Sarah] What's wrong with her?
- What's wrong?!
She's asking, "What's wrong?"
- It's serious.
- Should we send 50 people for it?
- Two guys went to fetch some.
- You're lying, or she's lying.
I swear, it's her.
- [woman 2] Reem! Reem! Reem!
- [man 2] Reem!
Are you lying to me? Is she conscious?
- Guys, calm down.
- I'm not talking to you.
[woman 4] I'm really so worried.
Don't shine the light in my eyes.
Point it here.
- You left her like that?
- Don't come near me.
Enough with the light!
- [woman 5] Think that's okay?
- Keep away!
- Put the flashlight away. It's in my eyes!
- They're getting it.
Shine the light on her,
or don't help at all, man.
- Calm down, guys.
- Shine it on her. Not on my face.
- Guys, guys!
- [gasps]
[man 1] Are you crazy?
- [woman 5] What?
- [Sarah] Get off me!
- [woman 5] Where are you going?
- [Sarah] Hey!
- I won't get back, and you will answer.
- [Sarah] Get off!
[Sarah panting]
[man] No. Calm down. Enough, please!
- [Saad] Sarah!
- [man] Leave her. Let her go.
- [Saad] Let me talk to you. Wait.
- [Sarah] Eat shit.
[Saad] I know I'm trash,
but let me take you home.
[Sarah sighs]
Who's gonna take you home?
- You won't find anyone in the desert.
- [shrieks] Get back!
[panting]
All right. Okay.
When you calm down, let me know.
[Sarah sighs]
Don't tell me to calm down!
Look at my face!
Can't you kick her out?
I can't kick anyone out.
Why are you whispering?
I am ordering you to kick her out.
Or I swear,
you'll live to regret it! [huffs]
Damn it.
[tense music playing]
[man] You really messed that up.
What should I do?
You know who her father is?
Start the car.
[alarm deactivates]

You're taking your time with this poem.
We just want a few compliments
for the national team. That's all.
There's no need for a lot of fuss.
No, Abu Fahad. Bless you.
I am writing an excellent poem.
Terrific.
- With a lot of effort and pride.
- Fine.
Read it to me.
"Our team's a dream with art supreme"
- [Abu Fahad] Espresso?
- [assistant] Huh?
- [Abu Fahad] Coffee. Do you want coffee?
- Espresso? Yes, please.
Come. One espresso.
"Our team's a dream"
-"With art"
-[Abu Fahad] "With art supreme"
[both] "On the pitch"
"And on the pitch
Like the top, the cream"
"Our Hawks, the Saudis, always win"
"Our Hawks, the Saudis..."
- And then?
- "Always"
[Abu Fahad] "Always win"
- "And on the pitch..."
- "Never"
-"Never"
-"Once"
- "Once in a championship did they seem"
- [rustling]
"They seize titles"
"That radiant did gleam"
- "On the fields, they are a winning team"
- [tense music playing]
Anyway, leave the notebook with me.
I'll revise it.
Indeed. I'll just leave it here.
Do you know of any chalet for sale?
[Abu Fahad] Huh?
[assistant] Abu Fahad?
I want...
[tense music building]
[cups clatter]
Out of there, you ass!
[rustling hiss]
- [slams]
- Show yourself!
Who are you?
[Sarah] Who are you?
[Abu Fahad] You're the intruder!
- [Sarah] I was charging my phone!
- [Abu Fahad] My God!
And you had to charge it here?
Is that how people charge their phones?
Huh? I don't believe you!
[Sarah] You're scared
because you're a fraud.
[Abu Fahad] What?
[Sarah] Chill out.
I'll charge my phone somewhere else.
She said what, Abdullah?
- No idea, Abu Fahad.
- What?
[Sarah] All right!
I'll charge it somewhere else!
Chill out, man!
You. You there. Go, bring the telephone.
Fast! Fast!
Hurry up!
[shoes squeaking]
[Abu Fahad sighs]
[Sarah, firmly] No. No!
- [waiter] Phone, please.
- [Sarah] No!
[waiter] Sir, she not...
She not give me phone.
[Abu Fahad] Take it! Take it from her!
- [Sarah] No!
- What?
- [Sarah] No!
- What?
- [Sarah] No!
- [Abu Fahad] It's not up to you!
[leather upholstery squeaks]
You're not leaving until I see your phone.
[Sarah] I told you, it's dead.
[Abu Fahad] Then charge it.
[Sarah] I'm in a hurry.
[Abu Fahad] Then charge it quickly.
- [crickets chirping]
- [tense music pulsing]
What did she say?
- "I'll show you."
- [Abu Nayef] Show us what?
Let's not.
Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, no worries.
- It will be fine.
We didn't do anything wrong.
It is unbelievable
how she yelled at us for nothing.
[sighs]
The world doesn't work like that.
Don't worry about it.
Keep calm.
[unsettling music playing]
[music fades]
Your generation is a joke.
That's the truth. Just trash.
What do you know about poetry, huh?
Your generation
can't string a sentence together.
Seriously, seriously,
you're nothing but a failure.
- Am I right, Abdullah?
- Absolutely, Abu Fahad.
Those... those swords inspire me.
I wish to kiss the swords
Their blades are shining
Abu Fahad. A word, please.
Wait. Close the door and sit down.
I'm off, Abu Fahad.
[Abu Fahad] Ah, yes. Goodbye.
Speaking of swords...
[grunts]
If an enemy attacks you like this,
how do you defend yourself?
First, you hit him
with the hilt like this. Ha!
Then, you pull the sword
and throw the sheath. Like that.
Then you grasp it
and strike right there. Pah!
If you want to chop off his head,
then you hold it like this, you see.
And you direct the strike
towards the neck. Ha!
Stand still.
But if the enemy is lying on the ground
like this, then it's the sting of death.
The sting of death goes like...
[upbeat ringtone playing]
The radio.
Yes, sir. How can I help?
Of course. Yes.
They want to record the poem.
[Abu Fahad sighs]
Abu Nayef, my notebook.

Don't mess with us!

- [soccer commentator on TV]
[owner] You lost your family?
[water running]
[commentator in Arabic]
I'll praise them deservedly.
Tonight, I'm not hiding my bias...
[in English] Excuse me.
It's not a Samsung charger.
Huh?
Yes, it is. Samsung.
My phone is also Samsung.
My phone is Samsung. Hmm?
Mm-hmm.
The Samsung charger fits, see?
Uh-huh.
Um, doesn't it fit your phone?
No.
I've got an idea.
Why don't you use my phone?
- I don't know their numbers.
- Then call the house.
- All out.
- Ah. That's a problem. [sighs]
That's a real problem.
[commentator in Arabic]
...the ball is passed to the right.
[in English] A big problem.
[commentator in Arabic]
It reaches Otayf. The third goal!
[exclaims, grunts]
[in English] They did it!
They did it! [laughs]
Super!
[commentator in Arabic]
...one day we'll recover.
No matter how long we falter...
[in English] Sorry, but you'll have
to deal with a lot of traffic tonight.
It will be busy.
If they win.
[commentator in Arabic]
The third goal for our national team.
[in English] How much
do you rent the quad for?
[owner] The store
is supposed to be closed,
but a group who rented some quads
haven't come back yet.
I called them earlier and shouted at them.
If you wait, they'll be here soon.
I can drop you at the main road.

[punk 2] Oh! That's too bad!
We'll miss the game!

You're the one who's getting stuck

Answer. What's wrong?
- Want to come with us?

Speak, girl. Speak. What's wrong?
It's okay. Speak.
- We're all friendly. Except him. He bites.
- Shut up!

Hey, boy! Turn off these quads
and park them. Move it!
- Chill out, man. No need to shout.
- I told you to move it!
[tense music ends]
[punk 3 making kissing sounds]
[punk 2] What? What do you mean,
an extra 300?
[owner] You were one hour late.
I called you and warned you
if you were late even a minute,
I'd make you pay extra.
And you agreed and went like this. "Tsk."
Ah, "tssk" means no.
Tssk.
Uh-huh. He just agreed with you.
- Said, "Tsk."
- No, I went, "Tssk."
And that means, "Tssk. We're not paying."
- Oh, really?
- Tsk.
Listen, man. "Tsk" means yes.
"Tssk" means no.
Tssk.
[owner] You're just keep changing
your expression.
Listen carefully. "Tsk" means no.
You get it?
Come on, man. We told you "tsk" means no.
- Tssk.
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Tssk.
- Tssk.
"Tsk" and "tssk" and "tsssk."
Many different meanings!
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Listen up.
Stop playing games.
- [tense music rises]
- And pay the extra money.
And if you don't pay,
you won't get back your IDs.
[punk 2] I'll show you.

till you see a small mosque
with a green minaret.
Then turn left.
[epic orchestral music fades]
[energetic electronic music pulsing]
[herder] And go straight till you see
a sign on the right.
{\an8}SUMMER IS BETTER WITH FAMILY
- There's a crossroads.
- [Saad] Okay.
Then you turn right.
You skip the first turn,
the second, the third.
- And at the fourth turning...
- [Saad] Fourth turning?
[herder] Yes, at the fourth turning,
turn right.
After 200 meters, you'll see a sheepfold
on the right. Go past that.
[sheep bleat]
And about 700 meters after that,
you'll see Abu Fahad's camp on the right.

- [man 1] Don't worry!

[commentator in Arabic] Feras AlBrikan...
Feras. And the ball goes out of bounds,
and it's a throw-in.
[retches]
[commentator] The throw-in will be played.
[Sarah coughs, spits]
[commentator] ...play has stopped
at the moment,
after Hassan Altambakti's injury.
Feras AlBrikan attempts...
[commentator] Too much stoppage time,
however...
[sobbing]
[commentator] The ball's still in play.
And the whistle is heard.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
It's a green night in Marsool Park.
Three goals have sealed it.
What a wonderful and confident victory!
What a performance from Salman AlFaraj
and Ali AlHassan and the rest of the team!
Bravo to each and every player,
and to everyone who gave us
this amazing team.
This joyous team
that reminds us of our old glory.
The nostalgia.
We do not rest on our laurels.
We're coming back.
I'm sure about that.
It's a matter of time.
Congratulations, everybody...

[Hadeel] Where are you?
I've been trying to call you.
And you didn't send the location.
My phone battery was dead.
I'm sending you my location. Hurry.
If I leave now, It will take me forever.
The streets are jammed.
- Take an Uber.
- There's no Uber here, stupid!
- Are you dense?
- Listen.
Yelling and screaming won't help you.
I'm just giving you advice.
It's your call.
And honestly, we're grown-ups. It's okay.
My dad once caught me going out with guys.
- He yelled at me, and it passed.
- [ice-cream truck jingle plays]
He grounded me for a month,
but in the end, he appreciated my honesty.
- You bugger off.
- After all...
[ice-cream truck jingle continues]
[man clicking tongue]
[Sarah panting]
[exhales weakly]

[seller] May Allah come to our aid.
- Take me to Riyadh.
- No, there is a hospital near here.
- I want to go to Riyadh.
- The problem is it's an emergency, so...
[Sarah] Take me!
Okay, okay, to Riyadh.
May Allah forgive me.

Someone's evil eye is cursing them.
Sarah, dear, this cake is for you.
From the best bakery in Riyadh.
Please eat. This is grace from Allah.
- May Allah watch over you, my love.

[father] God willing, she'll be fine.
But the shock takes its toll.

Don't say those other things.
[father] She'll be fine.
I'm not saying otherwise.

if the national team won, and they did.
I hope the poem is ready because we'd love
to hear it, as promised.
