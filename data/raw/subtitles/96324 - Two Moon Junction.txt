The tradition of our Sisterhood
at Phi Gamma Kappa...
goes back to the days
when cotton was king.
And just as it has been
for generation after generation...
the friendships you have
so lovingly cultivated...
and nourished here...
will remain amongst the most
treasured possessions of your lives.
Through times of happiness
and times of sadness...
good fortune and tribulation...
you will always remember...
this time together.
You are at a crossroads...
a junction in your lives.
May the road you travel speed you
toward your dreams and goals...
with no sudden curves or detours...
to divert you from your path.
For those of you who are graduating...
this is your farewell ball.
Congratulations, girls!
And God bless you!
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I have the pleasure of presenting...
the queen of the Phi Gamma Kappa
Spring Ball...
Miss April Delongpre.
And her fiancé,
Mr. Chad Douglas Fairchild--
the president
of our brother fraternity...
Alpha Lambda Chi.
The next time we all
will be dancing together...
will be at their wedding.
This is a dream
come true for me, baby.
From the moment I first laid my eyes
on you when we were a freshmen...
I knew that one day
you'd be my wife.
And this is just the beginning.
I've got it all planned out.
What I want is to make you happy.
What I want is to give you everything
your little heart desires.
What I want, Chad,
is to run away to a tropical island...
and live in a grass hut.
Eat coconuts
for the rest of our lives?
Coconuts and mangoes
and papayas.
Don't do this to me, baby.
You're drivin' me nuts.
That's the idea.
April! Come on!
We got a present for you.
Come on!
- Your hair!
- It's beautiful. Hello, darling.
- Your hair looks great!
- Outrageous!
What are you girls up to?
You just have to have this
on your wedding night.
We can't wait.
Frederick's of Hollywood.
What do my little sisters
think I am?
- Good Lord, look out!
- Sorry.
Hey, what are you doing?
Okay, that does it.
You're in for it now.
I'm gonna get you.
Come back here.
Get off my sister!
That's a hell of a shot, son.
You know, if your daddy and I weren't
so keen on you becoming a lawyer...
I swear I'd sponsor you
for the pro tour.
Well, Senator, I like things to work.
I like 'em nice and neat.
One of these days you're gonna hook
a shot, son, and get stuck in the rough.
And that's gonna give you character.
I mean that
with all best intentions.
Please, April. Please.
- Come on, April.
- Go on with us.
Just one more time.
Please, girls,
we really should go home.
Just one more time?
It's so much fun.
I'll get 'em off for you, miss.
I used to be a goddamn elephant tamer.
Kyle, leave 'em be. Move out of the way.
This one's on the house.
How about you, princess?
- Wanna take a spin?
- I'm not a princess.
I knew a real one once.
She was from the Sudan.
Her daddy was king for a day.
You better do what he says, ma'am.
'Cause if you don't, he'll just hold
your kinfolk hostage till you do.
I'd really rather not.
Come on, April. One more time.
It's so fun.
You'll love it.
I've known a May and a June,
but never an April.
I wish I could say somethin' to persuade
you to get on that ride, ma'am.
Wipe the seat off for the princess,
Kyle. That'll make her feel better.
If not for him,
then for me.
My blood pressure's high,
my heart's weak, my days are numbered.
There's only so much more
a man my age can take.
Come on, girls.
We're going home now.
- Could you please let them out?
- Cut 'em loose.
You tried hard,
but you can't win 'em all.
Round one goes to the princess.
He must like you girls.
He usually doesn't back down so easy.
Is there a Miss Delongpre
in the crowd?
Darlin', I'm talkin' to you.
I found this on the ground.
Thank you.
How do I know who you are,
princess?
How do I know
you're the real April Delongpre?
And who's this good-lookin' devil?
He your husband?
- Not yet.
- Two more weeks.
Choo-Choo?
What kind of name is that?
His real name's Chad.
She just calls him Choo-Choo.
- May I have my wallet back, please?
- Sure thing. Anything you say.
Hey, Choo-Choo.
I wanna wish you the best.
Now you say hello
to your mommy and daddy for me.
And tell your daddy I'm lookin' forward
to havin' a special dance...
with him at the wedding.
Let's go for a ride. Get a motel room
or somethin'. What do you say?
We're gonna have the whole rest
of our lives to be together.
You drive me crazy.
You do.
I'm never sure about you.
I never know what you want.
Bye-bye.
It won't be long now.
April?
Mrs. Chad Douglas Fairchild.
We're ready for the wedding.
Oh, Chad, you drive me crazy.
Does your mama know
where you are, huh?
- Can anybody here identify you?
- Her name's Kay.
- How well do you know her?
- Went to school since kindergarten.
What's she got on her mind?
Why are you following me?
What you got down there?
How's it doin'? Wanna come with me?
Which one of you girls
wanna come with me?
You better use it while you got it
'cause it ain't gonna last forever.
Smiley, Bock,
you cheap sons of bitches.
One of these days this whole carnival's
gonna come down around you...
if you don't start putting some money
back into it.
You gotta spend money
to make money.
Fuck you, Perry.
That's good, Smiley.  Fuck you
covers just about everything.
- I paid for that beer.
- Don't be so goddamn stingy, Bock.
What goes around comes around.
The more you give the more you get.
The cup's half full, half empty.
Reality is all in how you perceive it.
Isn't that right, Kyle?
Everything you say is right, Perry.
If you ain't the most beautiful bastard
I ever seen, I don't know who is.
God, I love you.
You got it all, kid.
You're an angel, you're a saint,
you're a cowboy, you're an Indian...
you're the devil sent here
to keep us all honest.
Are you in or out?
He's in.
Definitely in.
You talk too much.
I'm coming. I'm coming.
I know you love me.
I love you too.
If you didn't bite everybody, I wouldn't
have to keep you in here all the time.
And you're so fucking tough.
Good-looking, but so tough.
Remember me?
The man who returned your wallet?
Aren't you gonna talk to me?
You know the first thing I thought about
when I saw you here?
I really did think that--
no, hope's a better word for it--
that you were out here
lookin' for me.
Are you?
I couldn't sleep.
I know you've got a lot of things
on your mind right now...
with the wedding coming up...
and everything.
I can understand that.
So...
I'll be saying good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Let's go, young 'uns.
You sure you don't wanna come?
I hate leavin' you here all alone.
I'd rather not, Dad.
It's just the weekend.
Besides, I have so much to do yet
before the wedding.
- You take it easy, honey.
- I will.
- Maybe I'll take a swim at the club.
- That's a good idea.
Bye.
IfJessie calls, make sure
to give him our number at the lake.
Don't you worry, honey.
Have a good time.
Be good.
- We'll be going now, Miss April.
- Thanks,Jimmy.
Lookin' forward to the big day.
The gardenias your mom and I planted...
are special for your bouquet.
They're lovely. You make sure
and take some home for yourself.
Thank you, Miss April.
- Good-bye.
- Bye-bye.
I want you to get out
of my house.
Do you hear me?
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to inconvenience you.
It's just I needed
a nice hot shower.
This sure is nice-smellin' soap.
I'm warnin' you.
No wonder women smell so good.
What is it? Essence of lilac?
I want you to leave immediately
or I'm gonna call the police.
No, ma'am,
I don't think you will.
Our chance meeting last night
clued me into you.
Is this for extra dry?
My hair's awful sensitive.
I don't care about your hair!
Just get your dog and go!
How can I do that when it says
right here on the bottle...
Wait three minutes after conditioning
or your hair will be unmanageable?
If you got any ideas
about goin' near that phone...
I might just take it upon myself
to walk out on the front lawn...
naked-- bare ass naked.
You wouldn't want that,
would you?
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
You had your chance,
but you didn't run away, did you?
No, I didn't.
And you didn't
call the police either.
No, I didn't.
Why not?
Do you suppose--
I hope you don't mind, but I helped
myself to a bottle of champagne.
We usually try not to drink
during the day, but...
this being a special occasion,
I figured what the hell.
You frighten me.
I understand.
I'm sorry I had to come
into your house like this, but...
since I'm only gonna be in town a day
or so, that doesn't give us much time.
And I knew you wouldn't mind.
I mean, let's go over there...
sit on the couch...
and we'll get to know one another.
You're the cockiest son of a bitch
I've ever met in my life.
No, not really.
I just like to hear myself talk.
And I like beautiful things.
And a woman like you comes along
only once in a lifetime.
- Bullshit.
- I swear.
When I leave...
I'd like you to give me
a bottle of your perfume.
And as I'm driving
from town to town...
I'll put a little on my hand...
right there...
and I'll bring it up to my nose,
and every time I smell it...
I'll remember you
and how beautiful you are.
You got a mole on your shoulder.
Looks like a little kiss.
Help me if you don't have
beautiful skin.
You smell so good.
I can't keep my hands off of you.
I was gonna come and just have
a shower and a hot cup of coffee, but...
you excite me so much
I can't help myself.
Nothing like this has ever
happened to me before.
Oh, boy...
there it is.
I went to a store in the Mojave
out in California...
and the man there taught me
how to use one of these.
Thought for sure
I was gonna buy one.
Told me...
he shot a video of his wife
playin' with herself.
Can you imagine that?
A total stranger...
tellin' me something like that?
Look. There you are on TV.
How about a little smile?
You don't feel like smilin'?
I can understand that.
But April...
darlin'...
I didn't just show up here
by mistake.
You invited me.
You might not know it,
but you did.
It's all right there
in your eyes.
It's me, baby.
I just spoke to the real estate agent
in Tuscaloosa.
The condo's ours.
Congratulations.
I'm gonna stay up here a few more days
and lock things down...
and make sure everything is perfect
when we get here, okay?
I love you, baby.
Big kiss.
Bye.
April, honey.
Let me look at you.
You're gonna be
the prettiest bride...
since your grandma walked down
that staircase on her daddy's arms.
We got that photograph of you
and that handsome beau of yours...
just dancin' away
at the sorority ball.
Wait a minute. Belle.
I got a surprise for you.
Look who come to visit.
Well, I can see.
April, honey...
how wonderful of you to come out
all this way just to see us.
Are those flowers for me?
Do I smell freesias?
My favorite?
I stopped and picked them fresh
on the way over.
How thoughtful of you.
I watched you drive in.
I see your daddy bought you a new car
for graduation.
It's for graduation
and the wedding, Belle.
Chad's parents bought him one too,
only his is red.
I can still see
that Lincoln convertible...
that Belle's daddy bought
for her graduation.
It was white...
and it had the softest tan
leather upholstery...
you ever laid your eyes on.
April...
you turned out to be
a beautiful young woman.
Belle and I are so proud of you.
Thank you.
Well, come here and tell me, child.
Have you tamed Chad yet?
And don't you do it either.
Just keep him wild
as long as you can.
You're incorrigible, Grandma.
Well, now, don't you
Grandma me, April.
You know very well
what I'm talking about too.
I've been watching you
at parties...
with boys ever since
you were a little girl.
And I might say,
you come by it naturally.
I know I seem so sure
of myself.
Sometimes...
I get this feeling inside, Belle...
and I'm so scared.
I really find that
hard to believe, April.
When I was your age,
I was expecting a baby.
That was the year my father died
and everything fell on my shoulders.
Your grandfather,
rest his soul...
he wasn't much help to me.
But he was the most handsome
and virile man in the county.
And every woman that set
her eyes on him wanted him.
So...
I disciplined myself to play the cards
that life dealt me.
And you never had second thoughts?
Oh, April, second thoughts are a luxury
I've never afforded myself.
And neither should you.
It's just everything
is moving so fast.
I feel...
that I haven't had enough time...
for me.
Delilah, if my mom or anyone else calls,
could you tell them I'm here...
but that I'm out taking a walk
or something.
I just don't feel like
going home yet.
I don't know if your father told you...
but I'm arranging for you
to have this house after I'm gone.
This house and the property
from here to Two Moon Junction.
I don't know what to say.
There'll be a trust to take care
of the taxes and general maintenance...
and all I need you to do...
is to make sure
that when your time comes...
you see that it stays
in the family.
Can you do that for me?
Of course.
And I also wanna say...
how proud I am...
that you've chosen to wear
my wedding dress.
You deserve it, honey.
Earl, it's Belle.
Belle. How are you, sugar?
I'd like you to do
a little somethin' for me.
No problem.
I'll keep an eye on her.
Remember, save me a dance
at that weddin'.
Excuse me.
You from the welcome wagon?
- I'm looking for the other man?
- What other man?
I'm the only man.
I'm the last one left.
The rest of'em are gone. If I find me
a good woman, I'm goin' too.
The other man, Perry.
Do you know where he is?
Oh, him? Do you know he got
run over by a train, lost both his legs?
He died this morning.
Good-bye.
I think I'm in love.
Got any liquor in your purse?
Well, you got some money.
Go get me some.
Go with her.
Bourbon. Get me some bourbon.
Go on.
Don't pay any attention to him.
He's just drunk.
Maybe she's right.
Maybe I should come back
when you're feeling better.
Bourbon.
Get me some bourbon.
You fucking asshole.
What the hell am I doing here?
Well, he does have a certain charm
about him when he's not like this.
What are you gonna do,
you know?
Let's just go get the son of a bitch
some liquor.
Keep me company.
Tom, get in the back.
You ever been in one of these before?
- No, I haven't.
- Oh, you're gonna like it.
It's a little bumpy.
I swear to God, I can't stand 'em
when they get drunk.
Believe me, I learned you never wanna
mess with them when they get that way.
You just gotta ride it out
till it passes.
With most, if they ain't drunk,
they're dull.
I'm glad you came along 'cause he was
startin' to drive me crazy.
- You got a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.
Fucking dickhead!
God, I wish I had that discipline.
I tried to quit once...
and I thought I'm gonna die
sooner or later anyway.
What'd you say your name was?
April?
I knew it! You're the one
that's about to be married, right?
Perry told me all about you
the first time we met. I'm Patti-Jean.
Hang on.
Did that son of a bitch make you take
an AI DS test before he fucked you?
I didn't think so.
He said it wasn't 'cause
he was afraid of dying.
He just didn't want to be spreadin'
the disease on down the line.
Personally, I think he didn't want to
die and have people think he was gay.
He's pretty enough
to give that impression.
Kind of humiliated me.
Wanna really talk about humiliating?
I know this girl who flies
with Savannah...
and she told me that when people
die on airplanes...
they lock 'em in the fuckin' bathroom
until they land.
Now, I ask you, if that ain't
the ultimate humiliation, what is?
Ending up your life on a toilet seat
3 5,000 feet in the air.
You know? Shit.
Hang on.
We're here.
Shit. Hey! What kind of liquor
did he say he wanted?
Bourbon, right.
You got a bathroom?
Good. I'm gonna pee my pants.
Get the liquor.
I gotta go to the bathroom bad.
Now you know my secret.
I put a little rouge on 'em.
Makes it easier to see
through my blouse.
It's a real '60s thing to do,
but I think it's cute.
Boys would just howl when I wore
pink angora sweaters in junior high.
I love angora. You ever put yours
in the refrigerator?
Makes it real fuzzy.
I bet you got great tits.
I can tell.
- You shouldn't be ashamed of'em.
- I'm not.
And your hair would look a hell of a lot
sexier if you wet it and slick it back.
I know. I'm a hairdresser.
I know what the fuck I'm talkin' about.
If I do one,
I do 30 makeovers a week.
And that top would look so much better
if you weren't wearing a bra.
- Wanna let me try it on?
- What?
I'll shut the door.
- Come on. Let me try it on.
- Okay.
That's nice.
You wanna try on mine?
Come on. I designed it myself.
It'll look so cute on you.
You've got the perfect figure
for it. Perfect.
Come on. Don't be shy.
Just put it on say good-bye
to princess.
Sorry.
Look, I know it would look good on you,
and I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
Perry will love it.
Looks good, doesn't it?
Let's see.
It's at moments like this I can see
why guys like women so much.
And this damn bull--
he kept workin' around
in the undergrowth.
Here, honey, money.
Help!
Holy shit!
It's closed. Oh, damn it!
I can't--
Speed, where are you?
How do you stop this thing?
Somebody get Perry!
Hey, rube!
Stay in your cars. Stay in your cars.
Wait till they all stop.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You all right?
You see that,
you cheap son of a bitch?
Those kids could have been killed!
People put their lives in your hands!
- You got a responsibility to them!
- Fuck you!
Fuck you.
Everything is fuck you/
Everything boils down
to fuckin' money.
You want money? Here.
- Take it! Take it all!
- Money, that's what I like.
Stand back!
What you got there, Bock?
Is that a gun?
Get 'em, Perry! It'll take the French
Foreign Legion and the National Guard...
and the battleship Missouri
to take my Perry.
I gotta tell you something.
He got me so hot the first time
I thought I'd go through the ceiling.
He was even better than my second
husband and he was from Pittsburgh.
Come on, boy!
Holy shit!
Hang on.
Motherfucker!
Jerk!
Scumbag!
Cocksucker!
When's the last time
you took a bath, moron?
Thanks.
Stand back! Move back
before somebody gets hurt!
Easy. Come on now.
Take it easy.
Get off him!
Let him alone or I'm gonna--
I'm gonna--
Get your fuckin' dog
and your fuckin' girls...
and get out of here, now!
You want some?
The lady's got a secret...
don't ya?
I ain't got no secret.
I ain't got nothin'
except a bike...
a truck...
a post office box
in Clearwater, Florida.
So what color's your living room?
White, but it's not my house.
It's my parents'.
Is your bedroom white too?
It's beige in a floral print.
My whole place is wood-paneled.
I never lived in anything else.
Except when I lived in Vegas.
I was married to this guy
in the air force.
They put us up in this place
that was gray.
A prefab with a balcony.
You wanna dance?
Come on. We're here.
Let's have fun.
This is my favorite song,
and you're gonna dance with me now.
Go to him.
Ask him to take you for a ride
on his bike.
Nothing but the sound
of the engine...
and the clouds in the sky.
Don't worry about me.
I'm takin'a bus out of here
in the morning.
I don't know where I'm goin'...
but I can't wait to get there.
Delilah? It's me, April.
April, honey?
Did my mother or anyone else
call for me?
Why, no, honey.
Well, if they do, could you just
tell them that I'm on my way home?
- Of course.
- Thanks.
Bye-bye.
It's okay.
You can stay.
- Where are you from?
- Puerto Rico.
Is that your sister?
Cousin?
Can you ask your friend
why she's not wearing any underwear?
She said she washed them last night...
and they're not dry enough
to wear this morning.
She only has one pair?
You son of a bitch.
Bed's barely cold, you're already trying
to get someone else into it?
What the hell. I figured
as long as the room's paid for...
I might as well get
my money's worth.
You hollow, manipulative
piece of shit.
Everything you are
is between your legs.
Then why don't you come over here
and give me a kiss good morning.
I tried to go home. I don't know
what the hell I'm doing here.
It's called lust.
Yeah. There's no mistaking it.
What's happened to April is she's come
face to face with her libido.
Fuck you!
I don't have to take this shit!
I bet you didn't think I knew
what that word meant, but I do.
Libido!
Unchecked desire.
Who the fuck do you think you are?
You come to my house and take me--
That's not your house, sweetheart.
It's your mommy and daddy's house...
and you invited me.
I don't recall giving you
my address and phone number!
You came here
'cause you wanted to.
You can believe anything you want.
You're so far gone, there's no hope.
You're psychotic.
You know what that means?
Fundamental mental derangement.
You are beyond social redemption.
- It's better than being hysterical.
- You lose, mister. You're all alone.
You don't care about anybody,
and nobody gives a shit about you!
That's right, baby.
I'm the phantom of the night.
- Asshole.
- Princess.
- Motherfucker.
- Sweet pea.
- Cocksucker.
- Dreamboat.
- Scumbag.
- Precious.
- Pig shit.
- Dumpling.
- Scumbag!
- You already said that!
- You bastard!
- You better be careful what you say...
or people around here might think
we like each other.
You can rot in hell,
for all I care.
I'm sorry for the disturbance, folks.
You got to admit,
that's one special wacko chick.
I'm gonna buy you breakfast, asshole.
You know, I have a grandmother...
that I'm sure was about
the hottest thing on the planet.
There was a time
every Saturday night...
and they dressed up in tuxedos
and gowns...
and all go down to our pavilion at
Two Moon Junction and dance all night.
- Two Moon Junction?
- Yeah.
That's my favorite place
in all the world.
My great-great-grandaddy
was a pirate, you know.
Really.
Yeah, he and LaFitte
and a bunch of the others...
got very pissed off
at the slave traders...
and started raiding their ships and
setting slaves free in South America.
My grandmother says it was because
they had this dream...
of America being
the last bastion of freedom.
But then they realized that the problem
was bigger than they were...
and they really couldn't do
anything about it.
So they settled on the land
and started raising cotton.
And put the slaves to work
on the plantation.
My grandmother says he did it...
because he finally came to understand
there would never be heaven on Earth.
For as long as the Earth turns,
there's always going to be corruption.
Nothing was ever going to be perfect.
What you mean to say...
is that there was more money in cotton
than in being a hero.
Something like that.
You're going to make
a hell of a lawyer, sweetheart.
I expect to live
a double life.
Maybe even a triple one,
if I get lucky.
And here I thought you were
just another tight-ass princess.
Well, you look like a princess...
you talk like a princess...
and you definitely have
a tight ass.
Darling...
don't ever take
a Southern woman for granted.
Excuse me, son.
Is that your rig parked
over there at Malcolm's place?
Well, there they be, son--
Jonah and Jonah,Junior.
They're so old, they can't remember
who is Pappy and who is son.
They're weird
and full of superstition.
Burying a dead animal
on their land...
could cause the cows
to give bloody milk...
or bring on a swarm of locusts.
Jonah? Jonah,Junior?
I told this boy here
if he'd dig up his animal...
I might be able to persuade you
to drop the charges against him.
You see, it was dark,
and he wanted...
a nice place to put
his animal to rest.
He didn't know he was trespassing,
and he's sorry.
Do yourself a favor, son.
I loved my dog.
The song they're singing goes way back.
It's a kind of prayer.
So...
where did you say
you hail from, son?
The East.
Anywhere near Cambridge, Massachusetts?
No, sir.
My grandson's going up there this fall
to Harvard Law School.
I wish him luck.
We're talking about $3 2,000 a year
tuition, room and board.
But it ain't gonna cost me a penny,
no siree...
because, thank the Lord, we got
people around here who recognize...
and support outstanding achievement.
You know who Little Richard is,
don't you?
Sure.
I remember when he used to ride
around here in his Cadillac...
always raisin' Billy hell.
It got so bad, finally the judge had to
throw his black ass out of the county...
and told him
never to come back.
What I'm trying to say, son, is...
not much goes on
in this county...
that I don't know about.
Savvy?
Did you get your manicure?
You look absolutely beautiful.
Jenny, you have done a wonderful job
on the dresses. Thank you so much.
They look great.
You know...
Alice in Wonderland
has always been my favorite story.
I always dreamed of having
a storybook wedding, and now I am.
The shoes and the hat--
It's perfect.
Wow.
Pretty exciting, isn't it?
I just love these dresses.
They make us all look so good.
Makes your tits look bigger this way.
If you don't mind, April, honey,
I'm planning on using...
these kind of dresses
for my wedding...
if I ever get married,
which I probably won't.
But if I do,
these types of dresses would be nice.
You're welcome to it, sugar pie.
I won't be needing it after tomorrow.
Besides, next time I get married,
I'm gonna run off to Las Vegas...
and do it in a hot tub.
You bite your tongue!
Carolee, honey, could you give us
a moment alone, please?
This is gonna be a wonderful wedding.
I can't wait.
Honey...
there's so little time,
and I thought--
Well, I thought
since you and Chad...
are still going to school...
I figured you're not counting
on having a family right away...
so I took the liberty...
of putting together
this little...
care package for you.
I don't know. There's a lot of things
here, and I-- There's so much...
and I don't know
what you would use...
but what do you think?
Well, honey,
I know that you know.
We never really talked.
Oh, April, I'm happy.
Sorry, Mrs. Delongpre,
but April, you have to see this.
Come with me.
Come on.
You are so beautiful
To me
Can't you see
Everything I dreamed of
You're everything I want, baby
He's one gorgeous hunk of a man.
Can't you see
Isn't he the one at the carnival?
You know,
the one that found your wallet?
Till tomorrow, April.
Bye.
I don't recall.
Oh, shit.
Thank you.
- What's going on here?
- I have no idea.
Good afternoon, Belle.
- Hi, Grandma.
- Oh, you beautiful girls.
You're getting more beautiful
every time I see you.
Aren't they turning into
lovely young ladies, Delilah?
Oh, yes, they are.
They certainly are.
Is that any way for the future
Mrs. Chad Douglas Fairchild...
to be dressed
the day before her wedding?
We've had fittings all day.
Oh, you poor thing.
What is that monstrosity?
It's a tent, Belle.
Well, I can see that.
Whatever does your mother
have in mind?
It's for the buffet.
Looks more like a circus to me.
Girls, would you please take
these cold drinks...
out to those poor
hard-working boys out there?
- You look beautiful, Belle.
- Why, thank you, dear.
What about me?
That goes without saying, Delilah.
I told you it was him.
It is him! It is him!
He said we were the cutest girls
he's seen all month.
- Come on, girls.
- He's gorgeous!
You know, it used to be
that I knew the Christian name...
of every day worker in the county.
Nowadays, you just open
the Yellow Pages...
and dial a number and take
your chances with the riffraff.
Delilah and I are contemplating
carrying pistols in our pocketbooks.
Ain't that the truth.
Not only is that tent an eyesore...
it's a potential hazard.
Young man.
Young man, can't you do something
about those guy lines?
Somebody's bound to trip on that
and break their neck.
I think this will solve
your problem, ma'am.
Oh, and by the way, that's
a beautiful outfit you're wearing.
The finest of imported silk pongee
the likes of which...
I haven't seen since
Mademoiselle ran that layout...
on Princess Di's trousseau.
You're pushing your luck,
aren't you, young man?
I'm just trying to earn
a living, ma'am.
Minimum wage.
$3.3 5 an hour.
It's not much,
but I can make it work.
- You know, there's a line--
- Of course. That's what holds the tent.
That's not the line
I'm referring to.
The line I'm talking about
is the line...
between good manners and bad manners,
order and chaos.
- Cross that line--
- If you mean the state line...
I've already seen it.
There are place settings
for 36, April, darling...
taken from the court
of King George...
and handed down from eldest daughter
to eldest daughter--
every other generation--
from the time our forefathers decided
to legitimize themselves...
and join a civilized society.
Since that time,
the Delongpre family can claim...
three governors,
two United States senators...
three electives
to the House of Representatives...
a Supreme Court justice...
and an ambassador to Chile.
And at our table,
we've had the likes of...
General Patton...
presidents Woodrow Wilson...
Jimmy Carter,
Lyndon Johnson...
the actress Tallulah Bankhead...
and Truman Capote...
and that film star Grace Kelly,
before she married her prince...
and Betty Ford
after her rehabilitation.
Come election time,
where do our Yankee brothers...
come a-courtin' but here?
For where the South goes...
so goes the presidency.
And why is that?
'Cause we here in the South
take care of our own.
Always have, always will.
Perry, please come out.
I don't have much time.
I said to myself, if she comes here
and she's wearing high-heeled shoes...
then she's come
because she wanted to come.
There's almost $5,000 here.
Please take it and go away.
I saw your fiancé today.
I love that song he was singing.
He showed good taste there.
I bet you his friends are giving him
a stag party tonight. Say if I'm right.
I'm leaving now. If you don't want
the money, give it to charity.
Keep your money.
How come you aren't wearing
any panties, April, darling?
What kind of a way is that to come see
somebody you don't want to see?
I know.
Don't tell me.
You washed them out before you
went to bed, and they're not dry yet.
You know,
you're a real son of a bitch.
At first, you excited me.
Now you repulse me.
You've got no mystery.
- Everything you are--
- Is between my legs.
It's crazy.
I run a million miles...
and who should I fall in love with...
but the very girl
I was running away from.
You're lying.
You lie about everything.
Am I?
Come here.
I want to show you something.
To the merging
of two great Southern families.
Good luck to you, Chad.
May God bless you.
His name's Max.
I was gonna call him Tom II...
but I figured he needed
his own identity.
He's beautiful.
I was thinking about giving you one
for your wedding present...
but then I figured it would be
kind of hard for you to explain.
My cousins and I used to come here
all the time when we were kids.
It was our place.
We did everything together.
In the summer we used to sneak around at
night and watch our parents make love.
Then we'd come in here,
strip down...
and touch each other all over.
And one night after a party...
they both got crazy drunk...
took their father's Lincoln Continental
and crashed it into a telephone pole.
Timothy, the one who was driving,
lived.
But Charles died.
Two months later,
Timmy put a gun to his head...
and shot himself
out of despair.
You remind me of them.
We used to play this game...
my cousins and I.
They'd blindfold me...
and I'd try to guess
which one of them I was with.
I'm not your cousins.
What cousins?
What do you want?
What time's the wedding?
Noon.
Yeah.
I'll wait around...
till then...
see what happens.
Everybody, they're here!
Come on. they're here!
Come on, big fella.
Looks like she's not coming.
Come on, kiddo.
We're on.
Is something wrong?
Darling?
What's the matter?
I need a minute.
- Sugar, are you all right?
- Yes. No.
Belle, I think you should go back
and see what's happening.
Good God.
Oh, darling, you look so beautiful.
We're so proud of you.
Belle, I don't know
if I can do this.
But we love you...
and we only want
what's best for you.
- What's going on?
- What's going on, son...
is that you may be about
to get some character.
- Don't tell me she's got cold feet.
- No, no.Just a little holdup.
Don't worry.
I'll handle it.
If y'all just hold on a minute.
The bride's got a wrinkle in her dress
or something. You know how this is.
- Don't anybody go away.
- Big day, Senator.
I won't let you throw your life away
on a passing fancy.
Passion fades.
Believe me, I know.
What are you talking about?
I was afraid this would happen.
He will never interfere
with your life again.
Belle, what did you do?
He asked me for money.
I gave it to him.
That's not true.
He would never take money.
Everyone has his price.
Not him.
April, my beautiful,
courageous child...
have I ever lied to you?
Now--
I'm too weak
To believe you're lyin'
Lord knows I'm weak
To even read your mind
Gonna put you down
Can't stand your runnin'around
Baby,you don't realize
Not even weep and cry
If you should change your ways
I'd be so glad to say
Won't you be mine
I been hurt
But I love the pain
Lord, it hurts so fine
I'll never be the same
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to inconvenience you.
It's just that I was in the neighborhood
and I needed a nice, hot shower.
Sure is nice-smelling soap.
