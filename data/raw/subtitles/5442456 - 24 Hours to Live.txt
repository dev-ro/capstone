ZERA [NARRATING]: I remember
the first time I set foot in Africa.
Thought I'd hate it just like Iraq, you know?
Figured, it's just more fucking
sand to kill each other over.
But I was wrong.
It was the most beautiful place I ever seen.
Took my fucking breath away.
Then I signed with Red Mountain
after my second tour.
You know they offered
four times what the Army paid?
Better equipment, choose your deployments.
My family's piss-poor,
so I thought I hit the lottery.
You know? Get rich to make the world safe?
Fuck, yeah.
Yeah, so much for that.

[JAZZY MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO]
There you go.
I hope that's not the bait knife.
[LAUGHS]
The fish hate you, you know.
You think?
Yeah. Fish like older men.
If you read more,
you'd know about these things.
And because they hate you,
we haven't caught anything.
Now, why is it they hate me, exactly?
Animals in the natural world
are drawn to the souls of men.
OLDER MAN: They can see the light
that emits from inside us.
Well, is this a theory,
or something you read, or...?
Yeah, in a book in the library.
[LAUGHS]: Library.
You've never been to the fucking library.
It's called Shamanistic Spirit Animals.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
My point is, you've got no soul.
And there's no light inside,
and they know that.
They see it. They smell it.
But fish can't smell.
[BOTH LAUGH]
You are drunker than me, Frank.
Are you ready to do this?
No.
I can't believe it's been a year.
At least they're together.
- Yeah.

- TRAVIS: What?
FRANK: The shortest distance
between two points is a straight line.
TRAVIS: Yeah.
That's brilliant.
Why are we not doing it?

- We made it.
- Oh, shit.
We left the couch on the beach.

Where are you going to sleep?
[GROANS]
I'll sleep on the floor.
That's because you're such a hard ass.
No, it's because... because I love your rug.
Want some water?
[SIGHS]
All rivers run into the sea

Good night, Frank.

I'm going to... go for a walk.

They loved you.
Don't forget that.

You know, they were my best guys.
I'm not impressed.
So, you don't call,

Uh-huh.
You know, I feel like
a prom date the day after.
Well, I told you, I'm on hiatus, you know?
I know. I know.
So, what do you want?
I want you to have a drink.
Hmm?
Try a peanut. They're great.
I want you to put a pin
in your vacation for a couple days.
I need you to kill somebody for us.
Mm-hmm.
You do that for me,
zip back here and resume your reflection.
Just call me on Monday when I'm back, huh?
It can't wait till Monday.
Then get somebody else.
You really need me to say it, huh?
You want to hear it? Okay.
Red don't want nobody else. They want you.
They want the best.
How about that?
Still tough shit. I don't work for anybody.
I'm an independent contractor.
- Yeah.
- Like you used to be.
Yeah, they're well aware of your free agency.
Well...
thank you for the drinks.
I'm leaving.
You want to hear me out?
No, I don't. Say hi to Jasmin.
Wetzler's offering a million a day.
One million.
That is a suspiciously
high number, even for him.
Yeah, well,
the job comes with a mop.
Somebody else fucked it up.
How high are you authorized to go?
One point five.
Wow. And you take your usual cut.
You know what?
I don't do this for laughs no more, buddy.
Oh, shit.
You get that offer doubled and I'm in.
There you go.
MORROW: There he is.
There's your target.
His name's Keith Zera. He's 26 years old.
He's one of their own?
Mm, he was.
He's now scheduled to testify
on camera for a U.N. investigation.
- Against Red Mountain?
- Mm-hmm.
For what?
See, I just got you two million reasons a day
why the answer to that
question doesn't matter.
Now here's what matters.
Yesterday while in transit
across the Namibian border,
an attempt was made on his life.
And now Interpol,
they've hidden him off grid.
They're sending somebody
to take his deposition in the field,
but the location's unknown.
When's that going to happen?
Sometime Friday afternoon.
So I got 72 hours to find
this whistle blowing do-gooder
somewhere in Africa, and terminate him.
- There you go.
- What went wrong the first time?
Red Mountain used local militia,
tried to make it look
like a kidnapping gone wrong.
- Numb nuts.
- Fucking stupid.
- [SIGHS]
- You see,
they underestimated
one element of his protection team.
Her name's Lin Bisset.
Now, she's the last person seen with him...
and the reason he's still breathing.
Interpol, huh?
Huh.
Mother of one?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I don't worry about that part.
It's starting to feel kind of ugly, Jim.
Yeah, well, they're all ugly.
$25 billion corporation involved.
Half the U.S. Senate
is beholden to Red Mountain.
I know. I know. I know.
It's bullshit.
But they want him taken out.
Keep reading, pal.
We're wheels up in 10.
How did you do it?
LIN: I fell at work.
You know how clumsy I can be.
Are you minding your grandmother?
Not really.
Christopher.
When are you coming home, Mom?
Tomorrow night. I promise.
Okay. I can't wait to see you.
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
- Yes?
- Hi.
I'm sorry to bother you
so early in the morning.
I'm not even sure if I have
the right address.
I'm looking for an old friend, Lin Bisset.
We spent a semester
abroad together at Oxford.
VICKY: Uh, yes.
VICKY: That's my daughter.
What's your name, sir?
My name is Dennis Merrick.
I'm from the States.
Is she here? Could I... could I speak to her?
Unfortunately, no. But if you like,
I can tell her you came by.
All right, I appreciate that.
Dennis Merrick, okay? From Oxford?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Um...
actually, if it's not too much of a bother,
I was really excited about
the chance to surprise her.
And do you know where she might be?
How I could find her?
CHRISTOPHER: She's flying home tonight.
TRAVIS: Is that Lin's son?
CHRISTOPHER: We Skyped last night.
She hurt her hand,
so she's coming home early.
Who are you, anyway?
I'm Dennis Merrick.
From Virginia.
Old friend of your mom's.
Never heard of you before.
- [LAUGHS]
- Christopher!
It's all right.
He's just watching his mother's back.
I respect that. I got a son
about the same age as you.
What are you, 10 and a half?
Yeah.
What is that?
Is that a Wolverine bag?
Can I... can I see that?
See, I went to the store today
to get one of these for my son,
but all they had was the Hulk.
So I didn't get one. I don't know why...
Because the Hulk sucks.
[LAUGHS]: Yeah.
That's right. Because the Hulk sucks.
All right, listen, you two,
thank you so much.
And, you know, I hope we get
to meet again sometime.
Bye-bye.

Hey, you know an 11-letter word

Nothing, huh? I knew it.
Excuse me, do...

[IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[IN ENGLISH]: I do a lot of
traveling for work internationally.
I'm trying to learn a little bit as I go.
Obviously I need to learn more.
[IN ENGLISH]: You have a nice flight, too.
I'm going to need another beer.
BARTENDER: Here you go.
Thank you.
- No, no, no. Fuck off, man.
- What'd you say?
I said that's my girlfriend's seat.
Christopher.
I'm sorry.
St. Christopher.
Eleven letters.
Nicely done. Thank you.
My son's name.
Really? Huh.
What happened? You miss your flight?
Canceled.
1:00 p.m. tomorrow.
Oh, damn.
I thought I had it bad.
Got about 6 1/2 hours to kill.
I know a much better restaurant than this.
Can I take you out to dinner?
[IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
All right.
Let's settle up here.
What happened to your hand?
A work accident.
A work accident?
That sounds suspicious.
What do you do?
I think I'm starting to like you,
so I don't want to answer that.
So you're a stripper.
[LAUGHS]: No.
No, no.
Let's just say that, um...
my company tries to convince
people to buy things
by persuading them
they can't live without them.
And is that what you're doing right now?
Trying to convince me to buy?
I don't think of myself as a product,
and I certainly don't think
of you as a customer.
Don't you have someone back home?
I did.
I lost my wife and son a year ago this week.

My name is Helen. I'm a doctor.

Just follow the sound of my voice.
Just stay here with me.
It's all going to be okay.
His pulse is stabilizing.
Just stay here with me, Travis.
There we go.
You're doing well.
Hey, man.
What the hell's going on, huh?
The Interpol agent...
she shot you.
Do you remember?
She killed you.
And we just brought you back
from the abyss, my friend.
That's impossible.
Well, it's not, actually.
Red Mountain, they've been
developing this procedure
for years now.
And you wouldn't believe
what they've done to make this work.
Truth is, some of it's pretty fucked up,
- and...
- [DOOR OPENS]
...it's classified.
What do you mean it's classified?
How come you didn't tell me?
WETZLER: Top clearance, Travis.
Or, quite simply,
because you hadn't been killed yet.
Moments prior to your death, you made a call
stating that you knew
the location of the safe house
where Keith Zera is making his deposition.
Do you remember the location?
We've less than two hours
before he makes his deposition.
This information is vital.
1220 Longmarket, Room 102.
WETZLER: You're certain of that?
Yeah.
Good.
This fucking procedure is finally paying off.
This is on you. Kill Zera.
- Personally.
- Personally?
I'm sorry, is that a problem?
MORROW: I'm a handler now, sir.
No more wet work.
I gave my word.
To whom? Your wife?
Jim, this is the moment, you realize,
that the unseen line between
friendship and profession
is not where you thought it was.
And because Conrad went soft
and let the Interpol agent live,
you'll take care of her as well.
Yes, sir.
Now, this is it, Travis.
You're one hell of a weapon.
Godspeed.
Hey, Jim, get me off this thing.
[SIGHS]
I can't do that.
What do you mean?
This was always going to be a patch job.
You're never going to leave this box.
I'm going to get the doc in here.
Give you something to make it go quick.
We've done some fucked-up things.
This is how it ends, buddy.
I'm sorry.

Your body will reject the drug cocktail.
Your mental faculties will break down.

there's a built-in fail safe.

Don't make me regret this.
I'm sorry.
FRANK: Travis, you disappeared on me.
TRAVIS: Believe me, you have no idea
how much I wish I was there.
FRANK: Well, where are you?
I'm in South Africa.
Jesus.
I'm not coming back, okay?
Not, uh...
not ever.
What? What's wrong?
I'm in a bad way, Frank.
Bad like what?
[LAUGHS]: Well...
oh, um...
let's say bad as it gets.
It all caught up with me, pal.
You were right.
I don't think I do have a soul.
Probably never did.
You were such a great father-in-law.
You really were.
TRAVIS: I wasn't there for them.
No excuses.
Travis, you meant everything
to Kate and Adam.
Don't give up.
TRAVIS: Hey, taxi.
Taxi!
Give me that cell phone.
All right, now give me the keys.
Give me the keys.
We'd been working security
on a crude pipeline
stretching from interior Congo to the coast.
[DOOR OPENS]
And one day we got a call for reassignment.
INVESTIGATOR:
By "we," you mean who specifically?
ZERA: Rapid-deploy unit.
Red Mountain's top crew.
We'd been...
we'd been all over.
So our orders were to be
in Namibia by next morning.
So tell me about the events of that morning,
June the 7th last year.
We traveled through the night.
Fifty kilometers northwest of the border.
It was real remote bush, you know?
Typically, we'd take in two SUVs
or maybe even a Blackhawk,
so I was surprised when I was told
to bring up heavy equipment.
What kind of equipment?
Two loaders, a dozer, and a dump truck.
ZERA: They took us out
to a remote container yard.
INVESTIGATOR: And what was inside, Mr. Zera?
Bodies.
Everywhere. The place was packed with them.
Militia bodies?
Civilian.
Men, women, and kids.
Was there indication of how they died?
No. Not at first.
At least not to us.
And then, yeah, we started noticing
that each one had scars on their chests
and on their wrists.
Turns out they'd been medically
fucking experimented on.
And how many bodies would you say?
I'd say at least 70.
By that night, we'd dug a pit
half the size of a football field,
and we burned and buried them.
Each one. All 70.
All into a single mass grave?
Yeah.
ZERA: Which was when they reminded us
about our confidentiality agreements,
and told us that we'd each be getting
a $50,000 danger pay bonus.
You know, I took two tours of Iraq,
so, yeah, I've seen some shit.
But I...
I never signed up to burn
a dump truck full of dead civilians.
And that is something I will never,
ever get out of my head as long as I live.

they should chisel that on his grave.

- TRAVIS: Take this car.
Go home. Go back to your life.
Send somebody back for the bodies.
What do you mean, bodies?
I've only got 16 hours
and 4 minutes left to live.
That's my personal "on and off" switch,

This is as far as I go.
It's a fucked-up outfit, Lin.
Somebody's got to do something about it.
Just not me.

Can I speak to Travis, please?
It's someone for you.

Congratulations, pal. You're wet again.
We've got her kid, Travis.
If she wants to see him again...
you'll bring me the card.
That's all I want.
Come on, you know how this works.
You know what's on that deposition, hmm?
Just tell her to bring it in.
You're a real charmer, pal.
You got any more secrets for me, old friend?

they've taken Christopher...
in exchange for the deposition.

Lin.
Christopher.
TRAVIS: Listen to me.
I'm going to help you get your son back.
I promise.
I promise.
TRAVIS: You know, he's already
on their jet flying here.
They're going to bring him
to their corporate headquarters.
Okay, I know the route
their escort vehicle takes,
so we'll hit them before

Yeah, I wish I could say the same.
Who's your friend?
Amahle, Lin. Lin, Amahle.
TRAVIS: We met in '94, back in happier times.
Yes, when we were both real soldiers.
You know, we call him Travis the Cat,
because he has nine lives,
he always lands on his feet,
and licks his balls.
[ALL LAUGH]
And now this stray has wandered into my home
at this time.
For what?
What do you know about Red Mountain?
They provide a lot of assistance here.
Money for sanitation,
training, youth programming.
LIN: Over the past two years,
hundreds of refugees have gone missing.
[CHUCKLES]
My sister, please.
Tell me something I don't know.
They were abducted
and murdered by Red Mountain.
Used for experimental medical procedures.
Real Mengele-type shit, you know?
Human beings used as lab rats.
You know there are a lot
of people in this township,
people that work for me,
whose families have gone missing.
Come, let's go for a drive.

All right, the rest of you, let's hustle.

a car fire on the main road.
Requesting permission to reroute.
BASE COMMAND [OVER RADIO]:
Permission granted.
Just get your passenger to base ASAP.
Units 2 and 3, we're taking
a detour around this mess.
[CHILDREN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
[DOG WHIMPERING]
Is that Travis Conrad?
Fuck, man.
Units 2 and 3, dismount,
but let me handle this.
Hey, man, what's your name again?
You can call me Z.
That's right, Z. How are you?
Can't complain, Travis.
- How are you?
- I've been better.
I got $318,000 in this bag here
I'd like to give you
in exchange for your passenger.
Well, that's a very generous offer,
but you know I can't do that, right?
Yeah? It's worth your life to you?
What you going to do?
I got you outgunned 12 to 1.
[WHISTLES]
[MEN MURMURING]
TRAVIS: You see all these people?
These are the families and the friends
of those villagers who you guys
somehow made disappear.
Hey, I had nothing to do with that shit.
Yeah, well, I don't think they give a fuck.
Well, maybe you do give a fuck, all right?
You don't remember me,
but I served under you.
Musizi Bridge, Congo.
I know how you roll, man.
It doesn't have to go down like that.
What's your name again?
- Z.
- No, your real name.
- What's your name?
- Zack.
All right, Zachary, listen to me.
I wasted my whole life
learning how to hurt people.
I kill people for money, just like you.
And you know what it got me?
Nothing.
It took my wife, it took my son.
It took everything, you understand?
So I got a lot of work to do...
before I forgive myself, all right?
So I'm leaving here with that boy.
And you can either walk away
with a bag of money,
or I'm going to walk away
over your dead body.

Christopher!
Christopher!
Stop!
No!
[SCREAMS]
[ALL SHOUTING]
[GUNSHOT]
TRAVIS: Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Shit. Let's go!
- He's in the other vehicle.
- How do you know?
Because the passenger
never rides in the rear vehicle.
Never. It's protocol.
Out of the way! Out of the way!
[HORN BLARES]
Faster! We can't lose them.
Shit.
There they are.
[CAR HORNS HONKING]
[IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
Just trust me, all right?
- Christopher!
- CHRISTOPHER: Mom, is that you?
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
I can't see. Take this thing off.
[SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
How have you been?
Oh, I love you so much.
Get out of here. Go, go, go, go, go.
KATE: I can't do this alone, Travis.
TRAVIS: Kate, listen to me.
I talked to them. This is the last time.
The next time I come home, it's for good.
I promise.
TRAVIS: I promise.
We need to get you to a hospital.
It's a little late for that.
You saved my son.
Well... well, no, you did that.
Come with us.
I still have some work to do.
TRAVIS: And you need to get
that testimony to the authorities.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
[GROANING]
Travis.
Zàijiàn, Wolverine.
Zàijiàn, Hulk.
AMAHLE: Travis.
Is he still alive? Whoa, hey!
That's my ticket downtown.
Okay, guys.
TRAVIS: I hope you know I know every protocol
for bringing in a passenger.
So if you deviate,
try to expose my position,
I will not hesitate to eliminate you.
- Okay.
- You got it?
Yes, sir.
So call it in, all right?
Calm. Just be calm.
- Just call it in.
- Okay.
Red Mountain base, this is Retrieval Unit 2.
Inbound with passenger.
Over.
WOMAN [OVER RADIO]: Retrieval Unit 2,
this is Red Mountain Base.
Please identify.
DRIVER: Whiskey-foxtrot 9-3-4-2.
WOMAN: Confirmed. Your team missed
your last mile marker check-in.
What's the status of the passenger?
Passenger is secure.
Approaching east gate now.
Copy that. Proceed.
- [SIGHS]
- All right, you did a great job.
You can relax.
You know, I just probably should let you know
that I'm going to be dead
in about 18 minutes.
So the only thing I give a shit about
is fucking with these guys long enough
to let this woman and her child live.
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.
If you'd like to see tomorrow,
you just keep making shit work.
MORROW: You saved my ass back there.
TRAVIS: Semper fi, buddy.
TRAVIS: Is something going on?
We've been through
some crazy shit, huh, buddy?
TRAVIS [LAUGHS]: Hell, yeah, we have.
We've always known the risks.
Right?
The people that we go after...
can retaliate.
TRAVIS: Something happen?
Something happen to Jasmin?
No, man.
Kate and Adam.
TRAVIS: What?
They're...
they're gone.
Man, I'm sorry.
What the fuck?
This is not a kid.
- DRIVER: Please don't shoot me.
I'll do whatever you want.
- Sit up. Sit up!
[ALARM THROBBING]
WOMAN: Excuse me, sir.
There appears to be a disruption
occurring at the north gate.
Loading closed-circuit video now.
[SHOUTING OVER VIDEO]
Put us in full lockdown.
Then tell Mr. Morrow I'd like to see him.
Yes, sir.
Sir, we have a situation at the front gate.
Yeah. I know.
Fucking Conrad.
[ELEVATOR DINGS]
[INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER SURVEILLANCE VIDEO]
Sir?
Explain.
TRAVIS [OVER VIDEO]:
Go home. Get out of here!
Go home before I change my mind.
All right, Travis. Now let's get to work.
What are you thinking?
Patch me through to the gate.
WOMAN: Right away, sir.
Let me talk to him.
MORROW [OVER SPEAKER]: Travis, it's me.
It's over, buddy.
MORROW: You hear me?
These guys,
they're not like us.
There is no loyalty.
There is no code.
There's only one code that I live by, Conrad.
WETZLER: And that's for people to do
whatever the fuck I say.
I just ordered a team to find and kill
your father-in-law.
Give us the memory card.
That's all we want.
Nobody gets hurt.
Oh, Jim, we both know that's not true.
Patch me through everywhere.
WOMAN: Right away, sir.
Oh, come on, Frank. Come on, Frank.
- [LINE RINGS]
- Shit.
WETZLER [OVER SPEAKERS]: Move in
and capture the driver of that vehicle.
If he tries to retreat, resist or advance,
shoot to kill.
- [FUNKY MUSIC BLARING]
- [VIBRATING]
Oh, shit.
[LAUGHS]
Looks like we're both fucked.
All right, Travis.
The shortest distance between
two points is a straight line.
This one's for you, Frank.
[ENGINE REVVING]
[YELLS]
[SCREAMS]
MAN: Hold. Go, go, go, go.
Secure the vehicle first.
[INDISTINCT VOICE]
Make sure he's dead.
[BLUES MUSIC PLAYS DISTANTLY]
MAN: One, two, three.
Cover me. Left side.
Sir, the vehicle is inaccessible.
The stairwell's totally blocked.
Go around.
MORROW: I want a team up here now.
Yes, sir.
Echo Team on me. Move.
Send a strike team to find the Interpol agent
and that fucking card.
WOMAN: Yes, sir. Right away.
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING DISTANTLY]
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING LOUDER]
You got the right place.
And the right time.
# Tell me, how do you feel? #
# Well, now I feel pretty good #
# Tell me, how do you feel? #
Motherfuckers.
# Well, now I feel very good #
MAN: Strike team, moving out.
Copy that.
I want a status report.
On the target right now.
MAN: Copy that.
Approaching the vehicle now.
[ALARM BLARES]
What is that?
[TIRES SQUEAL]
- MAN: The security gate is down.
- Open it.
WOMAN: Sir, a security system
breach has been detected.
All perimeter gates are unresponsive.
It's him.
He's still alive.
Sir, there's nobody in the vehicle.
He's protecting the girl.
He's trying to fuck with us.
Shit. Sir, we got C-4 wired to explode here.
- MAN 2: We got another here!
- [ALL SHOUTING]
MAN: Watch it, watch it,
watch it, watch the lights.
WETZLER: Secure the room.
No one gets in here.
Tech, you copy?
WOMAN: Yes, sir. What can I do for you?
Send the chopper.
And get me an outside strike
team on that Interpol bitch.
Call me the second you have her.
Stay frosty, boys.
What are you doing?
I'm having a drink.
[MEN GRUNTING]
You want one?
[MEN GRUNTING]
A million dollars to the man
who kills Conrad.
But only if he fucking stays dead!

[SOBS]
WETZLER: Come on out, Travis.
[YELLS]
WOMAN: Sir, your transport has arrived.
[GRUNTS]
[PANTING]
WETZLER: You don't want to shoot him,
because you think he's your friend.
He had no problem looking the other way
when I ordered Adam and Kate to be killed.
[GROANS]
A man with no family has nothing to lose.
[GRUNTS]
You knew.
He didn't want you to quit.
He didn't want you to quit.
You could have saved them.
TRAVIS: We could have saved them.
I was protecting my family.
[SIGHS]
It was mine or yours.
Do it.
Shoot me.
[INHALES AND SIGHS]
I don't want to kill you.
I want the fish to like me.
WOMAN: Sir, we've located
the Interpol agent and her son.
The local strike team
is being patched through now.
I got eyes on him.
MAN ON STREET: Should I take the shot?
Negative.
[SIGHS]
MORROW: Stand down.
Let him live.
[CLOCK CHIMES]
Semper fi.
You know what this is?
This is the moment where you realize
that the line between
friendship and profession
is not where you thought it was.
Fuck you.
Drop your weapon! Drop your fucking weapon!
MAN: Put it down!
Don't do it.
[GUNSHOTS]
[WHIMPERS]
Hey.
- Come here.
- Dad, Dad, I caught a fish!
What'd you catch? Show me what you caught.
I caught a fish.
Well, show me what it is.
- Adam!
- [GIGGLES]
Adam, show me what you caught!
HELEN: Travis, can you hear me?
Listen to the sound of my voice.
It's all going to be okay.
Stop fighting and stay
with the sound of my voice.
Can you hear me?
[MONITORS FLATLINING]
You let me live, remember?
