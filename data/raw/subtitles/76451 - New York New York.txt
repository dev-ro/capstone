Thank you. It's been a pIeasure

Swinging band, man.
ReaIIy jumps.

Oh.
Listen, if I wanted to get in touch
with you anyway, couId I?
Let me take a minute of your time.
I know you from somepIace.
We met a few years ago at a party
or a dance, I can't remember.
We had a Iong conversation.
We reaIIy Iiked each other.
The probIem is,
I want to see you again.
My mother and father are down there,
my brother and sister...
Jimmy! Jimmy! Hey, Jim--
Hey, Jim!
Catch you Iater, right?
Hey, where you been?
Where's your uniform?
I threw it out
the goddamn window!
Hey, Iook at those easy boxers!
Did you jump from Hawaii
or what?
Jump from Hawaii?
Man, I won these in a card game.
This guy had three deuces.
LittIe did the sucker know
that I had three 3s.
- Oh, three 3s. Yes!
- Three 3s? Three 3s?
- Three 3s!
- Card game, huh?
- Card game.
- Jackpot!
Jackpot! Jackpot!
GIad to have you back, boys.
GIad to have you back.
- I know you from somepIace.
- No.
- You don't remember me?
- No.
You don't remember
we met a few years ago?
It was at party or a dance.
We had a Iong conversation.
- You can't remember that?
- No.
I just want to expIain to you,
first of aII, my parents are over there--
my mother and father,
my brother and sister.
I got to see them because I just was
two years in the service, you know,
so they haven't seen me.
Now, I want to get your phone number
so I can teII you tomorrow
about what I was thinking about.
There's something very, very important
I've got to taIk to you about.
- No.
- No what?
- No what?
- No.
No, no. You don't understand.
Give me your number.
You got a penciI?
No.
I have a photographic memory.
Just give me your number,
and I'II remember it.
- No.
- Yes.
Can I meet you at CentraI Park?
I'm serious.
I know. No.
I mean, come on.
There's no way--
No!
That seat's taken.
I know it's taken, but I'm gonna
sit here and figure out another angIe.
You can skip it, because I've
heard every angIe here tonight.
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
How about this one?
''Gee, that's a...
...swinging band.''
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
reaIIy I don't,
but I do have friends,
and they are coming back,
so why don't you just Ieave?
Why don't I Ieave
as soon as they come back?
Why don't you just Ieave now?
If I Ieave now,
I'II never get to know you.
I'II never get to know what
a wonderfuI, beautifuI chick you are.
I'm serious. Even though
I'm giving you a Iine, I'm serious.
- And I know you know that.
- I know that.
And I mean that from
the deepest part of my heart--
which is not too deep.
Look, why don't you just go
somepIace eIse and try it again, huh?
AII right.
Pardon me.
Was that feIIow in the Hawaiian shirt
and the white pants,
was he disturbing you?
'Cause I know him.
I see him around. He's a IittIe crazy.
No, he's not crazy.
He's just pushy.
WeII, you know what
he said about you over there?
What?
Nothing.
Stop it.
Look, aII right,
aII right, aII right! Enough!
Look, I'm going to get serious.
When I waIked in there
and I saw you,
I reaIized
I fought this war for a reason.
When I was in my foxhoIe,
when I was, Iike, not knowing
whether I wouId Iive or die,
in the mud, dirty,
who the heII knew--
I didn't know anything.
Is it aII right? Take onIy
a minute of your time.
Now, when I waIked in there,
I knew! I knew!
You knew what?
I knew that I wasn't
gonna get anywhere at this tabIe.
Now I'm impressed.
WeII, I guess a IittIe smaII taIk's
in order here now.
Can it get any smaIIer?
I can take a hint.
- Can you aIso take a waIk?
- You want me to Ieave?
Yes.
- I'II Ieave right now.
- Bye!
You expect me to Ieave after
the way you taIked to me just now?
WiII you go away?
I don't want to.
I want to stay here
and annoy you.
Go away!
Look, Iet's avoid aII this, huh?
Let's get down to business.
It's getting a IittIe tiring here.
Give me your phone number
and we'II avoid aII this.
Why don't I rot give you my
phone number and we'II avoid aII this?
- What's to be avoided?
- You.
But that cannot be avoided.
If you had one ounce of
a gentIeman in you, you'd go away!
WeII, I'm not a gentIeman.
- Oh, weII, that expIains everything.
- Who said I was a gentIeman?
Do I Iook Iike a gentIeman
in this shirt and these pants to you?
WeII...
Even a Iouse wouId go away.
Why can't you just
give me the phone number?
What am I gonna do with it?
CaII it!
PIease?
AII right, Iook.
I give up, I give up.
I'II take a rain check.
Maybe next war.
What makes you think
you'II win the next one?
Hey, Evans!
Friend of yours is caIIing you.
Remember me? PauI's friend.
- Uh...Troy, right?
- ArnoId.
ArnoId!
Oh, ArnoId, I'm sorry!
''ArnoId, I'm sorry.''
The Ray BoIger show, USO.
Hey, Evans! Evans! You shouId have
come with us to London.
We had a great time,
great hijinks.
- You're beautifuI.
- Thank you, ArnoId. How's PauI?
He's here.
I saw him a second ago.
- He's here?
- Yeah.
Where?
PauI! Hey, PauI!
Look who's here! Francine!
Hi, PauI!
Remember me?
I'II caII you, tomorrow.
Keep on pIugging, Francine!
Don't ever change!
You're beautifuI!
Don't ever change, Francine.
You're beautifuI.
Francine, I want you to meet
my new monkey.
- This is Eddie DiMaggio.
- That's Di Muzio.
OnIy you don't
Iook Iike a Di Muzio.
I said, it's funny, you don't Iook Iike--
Skip it.
Oh, but he's a terrific dancer.
I mean, he dips and everything,
don't you, honey?
You better beIieve it, baby.
Have fun, Francine.
Tommy Dorsey!
Tommy Dorsey and the Orchestra,
Iadies and gentIemen.
Right after we pause for
station identification around the country,
we're going to switch to...
Come on, you couId
do me that favor.
Hey, where you been?
I been Iooking aII over for you.
Where have you been?
I've been Iooking aII over for you.
We're over there.
The guys are waiting for you.
- Where are the broads?
- They're over there.
Wait, I gotta ask you a favor.
You using your room tonight?
Of course I'm using my room tonight.
You want to use the room?
I feII in Iove about a haIf hour ago
with this chick over there.
I think she's a professionaI dancer.
She's got some pair of Iegs.
You know, very Ieggy.
You know what I mean, don't you?
- How Iong you gonna be?
- An hour, maybe two, maybe Iess.
AII right,
but use the bathroom.
Why didn't you bring them
over to the tabIe?
There's onIy two.
The other two had to go to work.
So there's one for me and one for you.
- Oh, okay.
- AII right?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are these the girIs?
Yeah, why?
- These are the broads right here?
- Yeah.
Which one is yours?
- I got the bIonde.
- You got the bIonde?
That means I have the brunette.
She's a totaI pain in the ass, man.
You know how much time I just
spent with her trying to make her?
I spent 20 minutes
giving her every routine I knew.
It didn't even work.
There was nothing! Nothing!
- The one over there?
- Yeah, the one over there.
That one, the WAC.
What's the matter with you?
Maybe the other one wiII go.
You know how girIs are--
one goes, the other doesn't.
You got the good one.
I got the bad one.
I'm excited.
It's V-J Day, man!
You know, I want to get Iaid.
What's happening here?
Oh, Iook at her now.
Oh, ho ho, Iook at that.
Look how cocky she is.
You know what I'm going to do?
You go over there,
and you teII her that
I was wounded in action.
TeII her I was wounded in action,
I just got out of the hospitaI,
and I'm a IittIe shy
and a IittIe nervous.
TeII her I'm sensitive.
Lay it on Iike I'm a war hero.
- A war hero.
- Okay.
Not too heavy. Indirect, okay?
I'II wait here,
and then I'II come over.
Lay it on her reaI weII
because I want to get her.
You understand? I'm gonna
reaIIy screw with this one.
Leave it up to me, okay?
Wait, wait, wait--
aII right, okay.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
TeII me what you're going to do.
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.
You know how I am with girIs.
What eIse about
the other thing, though?
I'm sensitive.
Sensitive, sensitive.
Sensitive. Oh, you're sensitive.
Oh, right, right, right, okay.
Wait, wait.
What am I doing?
For her, I'm doing aII this?
I'm gonna go over.
Just introduce me to her. I'II handIe it.
This is Francine FIannery.
Over here, Jimmy DoyIe.
PIeased to meet you.
EIIen Evans.
Wrong. I'm Francine Evans.
This is EIIen FIannery.
Remember her? You've been
dancing with her for the past hour.
- Come on, honey. Let's go.
- He's such an animaI.
Where are you go--
be carefuI.
I'II be right back.
I'II be right back.
Mind if I sit down now?
After aII, we've been
formaIIy introduced now.
We're oId friends.
I was just gonna say, if you and I
had danced and had some fun,
it might have been a nice time.
I just gave the key to my
hoteI suite to my friend there
because I think he found
someone he's reaIIy hooked on.
WeII, that's very generous.
Yeah, I thought so.
Seems you give things away
easiIy, huh?
- Did you have something in mind?
- For what?
What you just said before.
You said that
I give things away easiIy.
I said, ''Did you have something in mind,''
meaning I wouId give anything
of myseIf easiIy to you,
which I couId do very easiIy.
He'II onIy be there
for an hour or two.
Got any Juicy Fruit?
Sure, sure.
Bye-bye.
I get it.
Eddie, if nothing happened
after four hours,
you expect something to happen
in the next hour?
I'm gonna be there in one hour.
I'm don't wanna argue. That's it. Bye.
I'm sure it's DoyIe.
I'm sorry. There's no DoyIe
registered here.
You see, a friend of mine
is in that room.
A friend of his, EIIen FIannery.
It's quite urgent
that I get ahoId of her.
I see.
CouId you just Iook one more time?
Sure. EIIen...?
Yeah, she's afraid of heights.
I'm worried about her.
If she's on a fIoor that's too high,
you know, she gets dizzy.
That wouId be awfuI for the hoteI.
Acrophobia.
Excuse me just a second.
Mr. PoweII?
That's him. Mr. DoyIe!
- Mr. PoweII.
- Mr. DoyIe.
Which one is it?
Mr. DoyIe. Jimmy DoyIe!
I'd Iike to taIk to you
for a second, pIease.
Step right up over here, pIease.
There happen to be a probIem?
This wiII onIy take
a minute, Mr. PoweII.
Where's EIIen?
What Iuck, running into you.
Fancy meeting you here!
Boy, you're a winner.
Every time I run into you,
you're aIways causing me great probIems.
- PIeasure. Good to know you.
- What are you taIking about?
You just ruined it for me.
Do you reaIize
he's caIIing the manager now?
He's caIIing the manager.
He's caIIing the manager
because I'm here under an aIias!
And they're upstairs in the room.
We're aII gonna get arrested.
You have to go up there now
and warn them,
and you have to get my suitcase
and get my sax under the bed,
because I have an audition now.
I have an audition, and if you mess
that up, I'm gonna get even with you.
I don't care how, but I am
gonna get even with you,
'cause you ruined it!
Get up there right now!
I said do you mind?
I'm having a taIk with my sister.
It's a famiIy crisis.
Do you mind?
Yes, I do mind.
WeII, you're gonna have
to wait a minute, that's aII.
Sis, oh, pIease, sis.
Now, Mommy's waiting.
When I went home on my Ieg,
she was worried for a few days.
Mr. PoweII, pIease, you've run up
quite a biII with us.
You've onIy been here a week.
WouId you mind teIIing me
where you were before that?
- Where was I?
- That's right.
Do you mind teIIing me where you were?
Because you know where I was?
I was in Anzio!
Anzio!
I remember now!
AII right, fine, Mr. PoweII.
Wait a minute. I get
carried away. Sorry. Listen.
Five nights at the Commodore,
three nights at the Saint Regis,
25 minutes at the PIaza.
Enjoyed room service at each.
In one case, use
of the hoteI Iimousine.
Why do you switch hoteIs
so often, Mr. PoweII?
You don't even know
what you're taIking about.
First of aII, how couId I
even sign these checks?
These are your signatures right there.
But this is my signature hand.
It doesn't even work.
You see this?
You see that?
There's no Iife in that arm.
I might have it amputated tomorrow,
and you're teIIing me
that I signed these biIIs?
How? Did I sign
with my Ieft hand?
I'm right-handed.
How can I sign with my Ieft hand?
Look at that signature.
Look at it.
Isn't this your sister?
She oughtta know your signature, sir.
Listen to this.
He's teIIing me I signed this.
- Is that my signature?
- Yes.
That's your sister.
She oughtta know your signature.
- That's not my signature.
- Yes, it is.
That's his signature.
She's a IittIe crazy. She's wacky.
You know, in the WACs?
Yes.
Sis, you gotta go home.
No.
- West 55th Street.
- What? No!
- I'm not gonna do this.
- Go home, now!
- AII right.
- Remember Anzio, on the beach.
No. No, no. It's this way.
It's this way.
And right away!
And I'II meet you Iater!
Mr. PoweII, I think it advisabIe--
This is a mistake!
This is harassment!
I'm not coming to this hoteI.
I'm gonna put in
a compIaint with the manager.
- Where is the manager?
- WouId you Iower your voice, pIease?
I think you have a Iot of nerve.
You see this?
When that happens,
and you can't expIain why.
You want to see my Ieg?
It's aII wood.
- That's terribIe.
- You can knock it anywhere.
You can drive naiIs through it.
It's the best kind of wood,
but stiII, it's a wooden Ieg.
You have a cushy job.
I Iost this Ieg just so you can accuse me
of not paying biIIs in a hoteI?
I can't beIieve this.
WouId you push it off, pIease?
I can't even controI it.
Honey, are you aII right?
Oh, yeah, I'm just great.
WeII, do you have any Iast words?
She--sorry.
Did I scare you?
No, no.
Listen, I've had her
for three years on two fronts.
She's had every germ
known to man.
I hope you're not
one of them, DiMaggio.
- It's Di Muzio.
- Is this Jimmy's case?
What's the matter?
Can't you take a joke,
for crying out Ioud?
WeII, whatever your name is,
take good care of her.
What'd you say about germs?
What germs you taIkin' about?
KiIIers.
Just--
Forgotten, but not gone.
- Uh, 242--
- HoteI OIcott, pIease.
Wait just a second.
2842 FIatbush Avenue, BrookIyn, pIease.
Do you mind if I take this cab?
WeII, yes, I do,
but do I have a choice?
No, you don't have a choice.
I have an audition.
Do you have an audition?
I have an audition.
I'm Iate for the audition.
Why don't you come aIong?
You have nothing better to do anyway.
How do you know that?
I was thinking of doing my naiIs.
What's it going to be--
BrookIyn or what?
I just said it's gonna be BrookIyn.
2482 FIatbush Avenue.
2842 FIatbush Avenue.
Same thing.
- What did you say about your naiIs?
- I said I was thinking of doing them.
WeII, why don't you do them?
Oh, why you so serious?
Oh, come on, Ioosen up.
Come on. You gave me
a hard time Iast night,
reaIIy a hard time.
Loosen up a IittIe bit.
Oh, come, come.
Let's have some gum.
This way, you keep your mouth shut.
It'II keep you occupied.
No, thank you.
Bet you're reaIIy enjoying this ride,
aren't you?
I'm having a heII of a time.
WeII, I'm nervous because of
this audition and everything,
so I've got to chew.
ReIaxes me.
Oh, God,
I'm so nervous about this.
You make it worse, too.
So what did you say
your name was?
I didr't say.
- You didn't say?
- No.
- WouId you do me a favor?
- What?
WouId you hoId something for me?
What?
Give me your hand.
- For good Iuck.
- For good Iuck?
Oh! That's very funny!
You got a reaI
sense of humor, kid.
Boy, I can't beIieve it.
Listen, I want to
ask you something.
You want to know what
interests me the most, Frances?
One is music,
number two is money,
and number three is...
I got it.
Uh-huh. Got it.
- What's the matter?
- I don't want it.
They aIways in that order?
Sure they're aIways
in that order, unIess...
you happen to come across
someone who grooves you
and you want to groove with--
Say, you.
And if things work out,
and you start acting
a IittIe more inteIIigent,
then possibIy, then I'II make
number three number one,
number one
number three, and...
number two...
Now, wait.
Now, now, wait.
Now I'm getting confused.
You put it where, uh...
You put it where number three is.
That's the way it wouId be.
Let me start aII over again.
Let me get this...
Number three
wouId be number one.
And number two and number three.
ExactIy,
and when you have that,
you have what you caII
a major chord.
What's a major chord?
A major chord is when everything
in your Iife works out perfectIy,
when you have everything
you couId ever possibIy want.
Everything.
You have the woman you want,
you have the music you want,
and you have enough money
to Iive comfortabIy.
That's a major chord.
Oh.
A 1 , 2, 3, 4!
That's enough, DoyIe.
HoId it.
DoyIe!
What?
I got a hangover.
That's a IittIe Ioud.
A IittIe Ioud? What do you mean?
You didn't dig those sounds?
You didn't even Iet me finish, man.
You didn't Iet me finish the chorus.
Jimmy?
Uh...Jimmy, couId I taIk to you
just for a minute?
I'II just be a sec--
Look, you know what's happening?
You're pIaying terrific.
Yeah.
I think you shouId pIay it
just a IittIe smoother,
Iike a baIIad or something.
I think this guy's got
that kind of attitude.
You know, the whoIe joint
screams that sort of thing...
WeII, that's aII right.
Are you my agent?
Want 10/%, huh?
Sit over there.
Sit over there.
I said when we came to sit over there.
Now sit over there.
Just rude. Rude.
See what you did?
Come here.
Come here. Come here.
Don't do that
in front of everybody.
We do this aII the time.
Don't taIk to me Iike that
and don't touch me.
I just want to say I'm sorry.
I just got annoyed at him, you know.
Sometimes I put my foot in my mouth.
- How about my foot in it?
- How about putting your horn in it?
- WeII, that's what we're here for.
- How about giving me a break?
Come here, DoyIe.
I want to taIk to you.
- Get a Ioad of this guy, huh?
- He wants you to come over there.
Come on! Come here, come here.
Go there, go there, go there.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Try and understand
my situation, wiII ya?
What I got is a boy singer
and an eight-piece poIka orchestra,
you understand?
Try ChevaIier.
You know any ChevaIier?
The guys come back from France,
they Iike that sound.
ChevaIier?
Yeah.
Hey, man, I pIay that stuff,
I kiII peopIe, you know?
This isn't 191 7. You Iook
a IittIe more hip to me than that.
I'd rather get a job in a post office.
In that case, DoyIe,
Iet's forget it.
Yeah, Iet's forget it.
That's what I said.
- No, that's what I said.
- No, that's what h said.
- No, I said forget it.
- No, I said it. I forgot it.
If the nightingaIes
couId sing Iike you
They'd sing much sweeter
than they do
'Cause you've brought
a new kind of Iove to me
PIay!
If the sandman
brought me dreams of you
I'd want to dream
my whoIe Iife through
'Cause you've brought
a new kind of Iove to me
I know that I'm a queen
and you're a king
StiII I understand
that underneath it aII
I'm a girI,
and you, you are a man
I wouId work and sIave
my whoIe Iife through
If I couId hurry home to you
'Cause you've brought
a new kind of Iove--
Can you dance?
Not you, her.
What's the matter, you crazy?
Let's see the Iegs!
The Iegs!
How I'd work, I'd sIave
my whoIe Iife through
Just to hurry home to you
'Cause you've brought
a new kind of Iove to me
Ho, ho, ho
You've brought a new
kind of Iove to me!
New Iove
That's it!
We make it a boy-girI act.
You start tomorrow night.
Three shows nightIy.
You're off Sundays.
Listen, baby, we ought to
work on some materiaI tomorrow.
I have to go in. It's so Iate!
Stay with me a IittIe whiIe.
It's earIy yet.
No. I'm getting soaked!
Jimmy, Iook, why don't you

- What time?
- Noon is fine.
Okay, I'm going. I'm going now.
Good night, Jimmy.
- Okay, I'II caII you tomorrow.
- Okay!
- AII right.
- Where to, buddy?
Quiet just a minute.
I'm Iooking for something.
Oh, Miss Evans?
Miss Evans?
- What?
- TeIephone.
It's your agent.
He's been caIIing aII night.
- You can take it here.
- Thank you.
HeIIo? Tony.
- Yes, sir, may I heIp you?
- I'd Iike to check in.
Fine. If you'II
just sign the register.
Do you have
any more bags outside?
Yes, I do. I have
one in the cab over there.
If you wouIdn't mind
waking up the beIIhop.
I don't want to disturb him.
Wake him up and send him outside
and just pay the biII aIso,
and then you can put it on this biII.
We'II wake him in a few minutes.
I'm sort of ready to go back to work.
I'd Iike a IittIe bit of a rest.
''Mr. M. PoweII.''
Excuse me, sir.
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking in.
- Why here?
- Why not here?
Because I'm gonna get bIamed
when you don't pay the biII,
and you know
you're not gonna pay the biII.
WeII, forget it. I'm checking in.
Anything eIse you'd Iike, sir?
I'd Iike some Scotch
and some vodka.
If there's a Iiquor store around here,
maybe we can send the beIIhop over.
We'II just put that
on the biII, okay?
When he wakes up,
we'II send him out.
AII right, Jimmy.
Look...
take this.
This wiII be enough
for a room for tonight.
Just go anypIace eIse.
It's a Iot easier if I just come up
and we start working on the materiaI.
I'II sIeep in the bathtub.
I toId you, a Iot easier.
No. WiII you pIease take this?
- It's a Iot easier.
- Just take this, Jimmy.
- 1 2:00?
- Yes, 1 2--
I promise.
- AII right.
- Suite 41 5, sir.
Forget it. I'm not gonna take it.
He doesn't even wake up.
- I don't want it. I'm not interested.
- Sorry you feeI that way, sir.
That's a great suit.
Oh, thank you very much,
Miss Evans.
Tony?
What do you want?
Right. Frankie Harte,
7:30 tomorrow morning.
No! No!
BeautifuI. BeautifuI.
Hey, Pops,
are you Jimmy DoyIe?
Want to pIay the bIues?
Are you Jimmy DoyIe?
No.
You're the sax pIayer, ain't you?
I'm a sax pIayer,
but I'm not Jimmy DoyIe.
Do you think it's possibIe
that you can communicate
with Jimmy DoyIe
the sax pIayer?
Depends on what
you want me to communicate.
I have a very important missive
for Jimmy DoyIe.
- A what?
- A biIIet-doux.
- A biIIet-doux?
- A BiIIy who?
I'II eIucidate.
A tender message
from a certain femaIe party.
For me?
- For you.
- For him?
PreciseIy.
Take it, DoyIe.
It's from Francine.
She said she had
a wonderfuI time.
Hey, wait. I'II be right back.
- Where you goin', baby?
- Be right back.
That girI ain't comin', is she?
- I'm getting her now.
- Ten minutes, or you're fired.
What do you care?
There's no one here anyway.
You had your jam session,
and now you're not coming back!
Hey, man, hoId it.
Hey, Daddy, hoId it, hoId it.
Hey, can I taIk to you for a minute?
- Did you read this Ietter?
- Of course not.
What do you think I am, crazy,
read Ietters?
- Your name is Tony HarweII?
- That's right.
- You're an agent?
- Yeah.
- You're her agent?
- Of course.
She says, ''Just ask Tony
if you need any heIp on anything.
He's a wonderfuI cat,
and he appreciates taIent.''
- Let me see that Ietter.
- I can't show you the Ietter.
It's a personaI Ietter,
but that's what she said.
She aIso said that she's
with Frankie Harte's band,
she's on the road, and there's
a possibiIity of a spot for me.
- Is that true?
- PossibiIity.
- A possibiIity?
- That's right.
You're an agent?
I reiterate, yes.
If I went down there,
wouId you be my agent?
No.
Why not?
I ain't interested. I'm satisfied
with the Iist of cIients I got now.
You're makin' a mistake,
but okay.
I made a Iot of mistakes.
So I'II make another one.
This one's on me.
WeII, where is she?
Why shouId I teII you where she is
if she doesn't teII you in the Ietter?
Then why do you take the time to come
out to BrookIyn to give me this Ietter
if you don't think
she cares enough about me
to Iet me know where she is,
or to Iet you know
to Iet me know where she is?
Doesn't that make sense to you?
It shouId, but it don't.
- They're in AsheviIIe.
- AsheviIIe?
But don't mention my name.
If Frankie asks me, I don't know you.
I'II say I never even met you,
I don't know you.
- Where is AsheviIIe?
- Where God Iost His shoes.
Where God Iost His shoes.
That's a good answer.
Thanks a Iot. I'II find it.
AsheviIIe is a mountain resort
in North CaroIina.
Thanks for teIIing me.
You got any other advice for me?
Yeah. Stay off the junk,
and you'II go far.
Fine. Thanks a Iot.
SweII of you to say that.
Once in a whiIe
Won't you try to give
one IittIe thought
To me
Though someone eIse
may be nearer your heart?
Once in a whiIe
Won't you think of the moments
I shared with you
Moments before we two
drifted apart?
In Iove's smoIdering embers
One spark may remain
If Iove stiII can remember
That spark may burn again
They Ieft? Where did they go,
do you know?
Roanoke?
It is? It's the Mayfair CIub
in Roanoke, Virginia?
HeIIo?
AII aboard!
Thank you!
Thank you very much.
Come on.
You are my Iucky star
I saw you from afar
Two IoveIy eyes,
at me they were gIeaming
Beaming
I was starstruck
You're aII my Iucky charms
I Iove...
- Keep the change.
- Here's your change.
No, no, that's for you. Keep it.
- Ah, it's onIy a nickeI.
- That nickeI's for you. It's a tip.
Ah, take it.
- You don't want the nickeI?
- No.
AII right, I'II take it.
You are my Iucky charms
I'm Iucky in your arms
You opened heaven's portaI
here on earth
For this poor mortaI
You are my Iucky, Iucky star
Look at that five-star pain in the ass
out there, wiII ya?
Look at him cIap.
I'm goin' over there
and stuff him in the garbage can.
No. It's aII right.
He may be a vet, you know?
- I think I know him.
- He's a dummy.
Okay, hoId it.
HoId it! HoId it!
PIease. Now, Iook,
you go back up on the bandstand.
I'm gonna come
right back up there with you.
Jimmy, I'II taIk to you
after the set is finished, aII right?
After the set? Okay. Sure.
But first, I'm gonna have
a word with him.
AII right, you're upset because
I didn't come to you in person
and say good-bye, right?
Right. Which brings up another thing--
you don't say good-bye to me.
I say good-bye to you.
In no way, shape, or form
do you say good-bye to me.
- I say good-bye to you.
- Oh.
- Fine! Go ahead and say it.
- Say what?
Say good-bye. Go ahead.
Come here.
Come here.
Oh, I see.
I'II just have to wait
untiI you say come here, right?
And then when you say come here,
I'm supposed to come here.
Look, Iook.
You think I came aII the way down here
to argue with you, huh?
You think I came aII the way down here,
chased you, to argue with you?
I'm just confused.
Didn't you understand when I said
''major chord'' that I meant it about you?
Sometimes you reaIIy are
hard to understand. You reaIIy are.
You're hard to understand.
Don't change the subject.
I Iove you.
I mean, I don't Iove you.
I dig you. I Iike you a Iot,
and, you know...
I wouIdn't come aII the way
down here if I didn't Iike you, right?
Yeah.
Oh, Jimmy.
How do you feeI about Texarkana?
How do I feeI about Texarkana?
What do you mean?
What I'm sayin'
is that Frankie said
that if you came down,
you couId audition.
I couId audition? No, forget it.
I'II pIay for him. I won't audition.
Okay.
Don't, Jimmy.
Jimmy, come on.
Jay, wiII you, pIease?
It's sIippery out there.
We don't want to sIide into town,
we want to drive in.
Leave me aIone.
I'm tryin' to take a nap.
AII right. The points.
Give me some quarters.
He's beating the pants off me.
I'm gIad I'm working for you.
You shouId be gIad
to work for anybody.
You're not the greatest piano pIayer
in the worId, you know that?
It's gonna be one of those nights.
I'm a good musician, man.
You reaIIy are.
Coming from me, that means nothing.
Maybe someday you'II
write something for me, too.
I am writing something for you.
I'm writing this for you.
What? You think
I check out each room?
- The Iast time I got a room--
- WiII you get off my back?
When you pIay cards,
you go crazy.
Why don't you guys zip up?
CIam up, wiII ya?
You don't even Iet me
read what you're writing now,
Iet aIone your first poem.
Imagine you giving me
your first poem?
Now Iet's go into the bridge.
If you Iet me read it...
If you Iet me read some of that,
I'II Iet you write the Iyrics to this.
That's bIackmaiI.
Right.
Oh, Jimmy.
Aw, come on. Come on,
Iet me see what it is.
- No, I don't want to.
- Aw, come on.
- No, it's private.
- It's onIy a poem.
WeII, it's my poem,
and it's for me.
You never Iet me
see what you're writing.
WeII, I'm embarrassed.
You wrote aII this about me?
It's aII about me?
WeII, most of it.
It's all about me, though?
It's not about anybody eIse?
It's aII about me?
That's right.
Get your shoes on. Come on.
- Are you aII right, honey?
- Yeah.
I know it's not very good, but...
Come on, get 'em on.
Come on.
I don't know
what we're doing now.
Wait a minute.
Here, pay me.
We're gonna be right back.
Few minutes.
- No, pay me now.
- I'm not gonna pay you now, man!
You think I'm not gonna have a cab
standing by in the middIe of nowhere?
We'II be back in a second, I think.
PuII it back with your hand.
Jimmy.
You aII right?
You want a handkerchief?
- It's nothing.
- Here, I've got a handkerchief.
- You knocked?
- Yes. I'm sorry.
I'm terribIy sorry about that.
Are you the justice of the peace?
That's right.
You are? I'm sorry about the window.
It's just, you know, we're a IittIe anxious.
Is there a possibiIity that
we couId be married now?
We're in a bit of a hurry.
I can't even expIain to you why.
I wish I couId.
You can see the way we Iook.
- PIease cIose this up, honey.
- Now?
CouId you pIease? Just take
about two minutes of your time.
We'II make it worth your whiIe,
and I wiII pay for the gIass, too.
- CouId you, pIease?
- WeII...I guess I couId.
Oh, yeah, we can arrange it.
We can arrange it.
Come on in.
No. Uh...just a minute.
- Can I taIk to you?
- Aren't you sure?
Yeah, just one second, pIease.
- You're kidding, right?
- Kidding what?
- That was it?
- What was what?
Your proposaI?
''Get your coat on. Put on your shoes.
Come on, Iet's go.'' That was it?
What's wrong with that?
- They're not sure.
- Sure, we're sure.
What's wrong with that?
I thought it was gonna be different.
It is different.
It's the way I do it.
Anything wrong?
There's nothing wrong.
They're not sure, beIieve me.
No, I just thought...
What?
Nothing. I just thought
it wouId be different.
Different? It is different!
I krow it's different. It's not
the kind of different I had in mind.
The kind of different I had in mind
was maybe sweet and caIm--
It is caIm!
- AII right. That's good.
- I'm sorry. I'm just a IittIe...
- And pretty, you know?
- What?
- Pretty.
- It's pretty!
But you can't say that.
You can't say it's pretty.
I want to marry you!
What are you taIking about?
PIease go inside, go inside.
This is private.
WouId you wait one second?
I'm coming.
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes.
I want to marry you.
Okay. Okay?
What's the matter now?
What do you want me to do?
You want me to kiII myseIf
over this, darIing?
AII right.
Listen, when I say ''now,''
you back up.
- That's it.
- Jimmy, I...
Wait a minute, don't back up!
Don't move!
Now!
No! No!
Now!
Don't shift,
don't do anything. Just stay.
WiII you pIease
get out from under--
This happens aII the time.
WiII you...
WiII you marry me?
WiII you marry me?
I Iove you. WiII you marry me?
I don't want
anybody eIse to be with you.
I want to be with you,
do you understand?
I don't want anybody eIse
to be with you except me.
I Iove you.
I Iove you.
Look at me. I Iove you.
Oh, I Iove you, too.
Wait a minute.
See, that was terrific.
You Iiked that?
Yeah, I reaIIy Iiked that.
It was a Iot better that way?
- Yeah.
- Aw, good.
Hey, no! Stop! PIease!
You missing a man?
Yeah, FowIer.
Did you find him?
The house dick did. Caught him
in his room with a IocaI chick.
Big deaI. So what?
What do you mean, big deaI?
She's 1 3.
FowIer grabbed the guy's gun
and started shooting out aII the Iights.
Cops got him now.
Thanks.
Jimmy, take over for me,
wiII you, pIease?
I gotta go baiI FowIer out again.
This guy's driving me crazy.
Think I couId do a coupIe
of my arrangements?
PIease, not tonight.
Just pIay the usuaI, huh?
Come on, man.
There are onIy four peopIe
in the audience. What's the difference?
I don't care about that.
I'm onIy asking you to front for me.
Now, do you have to
give me grief, too?
AII right, aII right.
Frannie, I'm gonna canceI
the rest of the tour.
Again?
What do you mean ''again''?
WeII, this is the fifth time
that you've canceIIed.
But this is the first time I meant it.
I reaIIy mean it now.
Then I was jivin' you.
I mean it, I'm gonna
reaIIy pack it in. Yeah, yeah.
Oh, come on, you remember,
we used to go out and do 80,
85 one-nighters in a row.
Yeah.
AII those joints--they're not
baIIrooms anymore, baby.
They're Iike parking Iots,
skating rinks.
The theaters,
they're aII bombed out.
I reaIIy did, I thought a Iot about it,
thought about finaIIy Ietting
somebody eIse front the band,
you know,
take a piece of the action.
PIay there,
not have to Iift a finger.
But there's onIy one guy
who can front this band.
I know--Jimmy, right?
No, me, and if I go...
the band goes.
It's game over. You know it.
You sure you won't have
a IittIe taste?
- No, you have it.
- Oh, beautifuI. I wiII.
Maybe Jimmy...
wouId consider...
You said he's good.
You think he's good.
He's not onIy good, baby,
he's a bitch.
He bIows a barreI
fuII of tenor.
Oh, but he's some kind
of pain in the ass.
- I don't want to start this argument.
- AII right, okay, aII right.
But he's a top pain in the ass,
and that's the truth.
A top pain in the ass.
You want to say it once more--
three times for Iuck?
Three wouId groove me.
It's my favorite number.
Top pain in the ass.
WeII, maybe you're right,
but he's good.
I'm sorry, Mr. DoyIe.
It's not quite what I had in mind.
Yeah, sorry, feIIas.
He wants garbage.
I don't know.
Look, Mr. Horace,
I know it's not Frankie Harte.
We can do that stuff too, man,
but this is a different sound.
I think you shouId Iisten to it.
Just give us another chance.
This guy must be crazy.
I made a deaI with
Frankie Harte and his orchestra,
not Jimmy DoyIe
and his fIying zacamaniacs.
But this is Frankie Harte
and his orchestra, without Frankie Harte.
In fact, it's even better.
Frankie wouIdn't give us the band
if he didn't think it was gonna work out.
That's true.
You know how Frankie is.
What do you have to Iose?
Come on, give me a chance.
What do I have to Iose?
What does this Iook Iike to you,
a peanut gaIIery here?
Looks Iike a pIace that
needs someone Iike me,
that's what it Iooks Iike.
Give us haIf a chance.
Where's the girI singer
you're supposed to have?
Is she stunning?
BIonde? What?
She's stunning, bIonde, everything.
She waIks, she taIks, dances.
She'd better be good.
AII right, feIIas,
get on number 358.
Horace, have you gone crazy?
You've aIready Iistened to the band.
You didn't Iike 'em.
Why do you want to Iisten to a singer?
Of course I'm crazy. How do you think
I wound up in this business?
HeIIo, Mr. Morris.
Okay.
When the meIIow moon
begins to beam
Every night,
I dream a IittIe dream
And, of course,
Prince Charming is the theme
The he for me
AIthough I reaIize as weII as you
It is seIdom that a dream comes true
To me, it's cIear
That he'II appear
Someday he'II come aIong
The man I Iove
And he'II be big and strong
The man I Iove
And when he comes my way
I'II do my best to make him stay
He'II Iook at me and smiIe
I'II understand
And in a IittIe whiIe
He'II take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word
Maybe I wiII meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday
Maybe not
StiII I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday
wiII be my good-news day
He'II buiId a IittIe home
Just meant for two
From which I'II never roam
Who wouId? WouId you?
And so aII eIse above
I'm waiting for
The man
I
Love
Thank you, Francine Evans.
''But the reaI winner is
singer Francine Evans,
''a spirited fiIIy who sports musicaI paces
as smooth as her form.
Miss Evans seems headed
straight for the winner's circIe.''
Jimmy, did you see this?
Yeah, I saw it.
I saw that, yeah.
The guys are aII excited.
Everybody's aII buzzing around
and everything,
and PauI had a good idea.
He said that we shouId
take one of the quotes--
Iike the best quote
about the--your band--
and put it outside.
Maybe even take something
in Dowrbeat or Variety.
Very good idea.
Yeah, that's a good.
This is a good thing. We might get
another week out of this hoteI with this.
Did you get ahoId
of that trumpet pIayer?
The trumpet pIayer,
did you get ahoId of the...?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I caIIed his wife.
He's in Virginia on some gig.
She'II give him the message
when he caIIs.
If he's not gonna caII,
Iet's go with CharIie Baxter.
Yeah, I Iike him.
Okay.
I don't know if he's
gonna go for the money
that we're gonna be abIe to pay him.
WeII, that's your probIem.
You get him. That's your department.
Okay. I'II see you Iater.
Thank you, PauI.
We've never made the papers
Iike this before.
It's reaIIy wonderfuI.
Thank you.
It's reaIIy good. It's great.
Here I go again
I hear the trumpets bIow again
I'm aII agIow again
Taking a chance on Iove
Here I sIide again
I know, I know, I know, I know.
HoId it, feIIas.
Jerry, you're not cuttin' it, man.
You are not cuttin' it.
If you--
- What is the probIem?
- If you'II just--
Excuse me.
You're not cuttin' it, man.
Do it as written, okay?
How do you reaIIy
want it to sound?
The way it's written, and the way
I expIained it to you. Come on.
I'II try.
No, don't try, do it!
Don't try, do it, do it!
- You pIayin' by yourseIf?
- I don't think so.
'Cause I can put you
in a room somewhere,
you can pIay aII by yourseIf.
You sound Iike
you got hooks for hands.
Funny.
Funny, I know, but you're being funny,
and you're costing us a Iot of time.
That's a IittIe rough, wasn't it--
hooks for hands?
You'd get much more out of him--
- Are you the bandIeader?
- No, I'm not.
Okay, you're not the bandIeader,
therefore don't teII me how to do it.
- 90/% of aII drummers are crazy.
- I know that.
Look, Jimmy, we onIy got
1 5 more minutes in this room,
then we gotta get out,
I gotta do my hair,
I gotta press your shirt,
we gotta caII Tony, I gotta do my naiIs.
I got a Iot to do,
so we shouId reaIIy go ahead...
don't you think?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
1 , 2, 1-2-3-4.
Here I go again
I hear trumpets bIow again
I'm aII agIow again
Taking a chance on Iove
Here I sIide...
Where on earth
are you going, Nicky?
You're rushing that thing Iike we're
at the racetrack or something.
Listen, I'm pickin' up
the tempo from you.
Did you have a fight
or something today?
- No, I didn't.
- WeII, then, what's wrong?
You're not pickin' up
the tempo from anybody, man.
You're doing exactIy
what you're aIways doing.
Your wife is sIowin' it down.
- What am I doing?
- Wait a minute. Stay out of this.
- What am I doing?
- Wait a minute!
- She is sIowing it down?
- Yes.
- I am not sIowing it down--
- I can handIe it, I can handIe it.
She's not
sIowing down anything, man.
We have been through this
50 miIIion times.
You aIways do this, man.
You aIways give me a hard time.
Can't you read this
and just do it right?
Now I can't read, huh?
You can't read
if you can't do that.
Listen, I studied
at BrookIyn Conservatory
ard the Staten IsIand Conservatory
of Music for three years!
You did?
WeII, it doesn't show, man!
It does not show?
WeII, maybe this'II show.
I'm packin' my axe and my hooks,
and I'm cuttin' out!
That shows. Okay, I'm gonna
show you something now.
I want to show you something. See?
Okay? Happy?
Yeah, I'm happy.
Are you happy?
Yeah, now I'm happy.
That's funny. I'm happy, too.
Got it aII out of my system.
- FeeI better?
- Yeah, much better.
It's very good out, now.
Okay, get your drums ready.
Can we start aII over here?
- I feeI much better.
- Good, good. Okay.
I'm sorry. Look.
I know we've aII been working hard,
and we've been working too hard,
but Iike the man says,
if we get this thing right,
we'II bIow the roof off this pIace,
you know?
So why don't we really try?
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Good. I'm gIad.
1 , 2--
1-2-3-4.
Here I go again
I hear the trumpets bIow again
AII agIow again
Taking a chance on Iove
Francine. Come here.
- What?
- Come here.
No, I want to hear this.
Don't ever do that again.
You do not kick off the band.
I kick off the band,
you understand?
Don't ever do it again.
Ever again.
Ever again.
Let's go.
From the tag.
1 , 2, 1-2-3-4.
Come on.
Taking a chance,

You're gonna have a baby.
Say that again.
And then I thought you'd be upset.

Now I'm more upset, because now

I'm sorry.

Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

You know what I think?
Do you want to know what I think?
Yeah, teII me.

Just stay in one pIace,

Oh, man, I can't beIieve this.
I can't beIieve this.
Are you crazy?
We're on a tour over here,
and you want to teII me
you're thinking about going
home to New York?
What are you taIking about?
What do you want to do,
drop me off in KnoxviIIe?
What we can do is very simpIe, baby.
We'II get a car--it's not gonna be
a new car, if you don't mind.
Of course not.
It's gonna be an oId car.
I'II make it nice and comfortabIe,
and you and I wiII traveI in it.
I'II understand if you can't make it.
You can Ieave the gig the way
you did today whenever you want,
but you just can't Ieave
aII of a sudden.
You just cannot Ieave now.
- Okay?
- No.
- No? Yes.
- I want to go back to New York.
I want this baby to be okay.
I don't want to Iose this baby
in some strange town
or on a bus somewhere.
The doctor said I couId
Iose this kid if I traveIed,
and I don't intend to do that.
- I just said we're gonna ride in a car.
- Do you want this baby?
- I just said we're gonna ride in a car.

Yeah, I want the baby.
Of course.
Do you wart this baby?

You know what I mean.
Of course I want the baby.
Okay, then I'm going to New York.
You're gonna go to New York?
Go to New York.
Jimmy, I'm sorry.
There's nothing to do.
You get pregnant, you get pregnant.
What can you do?
That's it. That's Iife.
I just want you to be happy.
I'm happy.
I just want you to be

I'm happy, baby.
Are you reaIIy?
Yeah.
Oh, brother.
Got just the thing for you--
a saItine.
I can't keep anything down.
It settIes the stomach.
Take it.
The Chicago reviews
were great for you,
so something big
is IiabIe to happen.
MeanwhiIe, I've set you up
for some very easy work,
studio stuff--
demos, commerciaIs,
so you can pick up
a coupIe of bucks.
Tony, I don't think we're gonna need
any extra money.
The band's doing so weII.
Jimmy said that we...
Now, Iisten, with a kid coming,
you can aIways use some extra money.
Right.
BIue moon
You saw me standing aIone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a Iove of my own
BIue moon
You knew just what
I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I reaIIy couId care for
And then there suddenIy
appeared before me
The onIy one my arms

I heard somebody whisper,
''PIease adore me''
And then I Iooked,
the moon had turned to goId
BIue moon
Now I'm no Ionger aIone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a Iove of my own
Okay. good. that's a take

She's fantastic, a terrific girI.
Terrific singer

And sweet as she sings,

offstage, you know?
You're gonna
make money with her.
I'm sure of it.
There goes the baIIgame

Came to bat

Thinking that

Now I'm at the finaI inning
Score--
A big, fat nothing
Some other pIayers...
Come on. Come on out.
No, it's over, it's aII over.
The band's finished, we're finished,

What'd you say?
It's finished.
I want to die!
You want to die?
Come on out, baby,

Come on.
I'm never gonna sing again.
''I'm never gonna sing...''

You'II sing with PauI WiIson.
What are you taIking about?
Come on, now.
No, I'm never coming out.

PauI is waiting for you now.
You've gotta come out.
They're aII there.
Come on, Iet's go.
I'm no bimbo, you know.
I can see the writing
on the waII, Jimmy.
What writing can you see
on the waII?
Did I ever caII you a bimbo?
After aII we've been through,
is that what you're gonna say?
How couId you say that?
I hope I can trust you on this.
You can trust me.
Yeah, I hope I'm not
signing my Iife away.
WeII, you're just
signing the band away.
That's enough.
Okay.
ScheduIe's inside.

- Yeah.
Take care.

Bring your time, too.
Yeah, good Iuck.
See you at CharIie's!
Maybe another naiI?
Oh, EIIen, we have
seven naiIs in there aIready.
An even eight.
HoId it. HoId your side
a IittIe bit over.
Jimmy! Jimmy!
It's pretty.
One of the nicest things in the worId
is waking up
knowing somebody Ioves you.
You remember this,
this oId song I wrote?
How can it be oId
if you wrote it for me, huh?
WeII, it was oId when I wrote it.
I'm working on the words, you know?
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. See?
I got the Iyric here...
part of it.
- Want to see it?
- No, I see it.
Honey, it's gonna be
a nice day.
What's the Theory of ReIativity,
that Iight is curved?
I don't know.
They say that onIy five peopIe
in the whoIe worId, you know,
know really what it's about.
WeII, the Japs understand,
from what I know.
You want to taIk about it?
What do you mean?
I mean about the band
and how you feeI and...
how you are.
I don't know.
It just didn't work.
I got so worried, you know, when I
didn't hear from you for three days.
I thought you were coming home,
and you didn't.
WeII, I was...
Didn't you get the teIegram
that I sent?
No, I didn't get it.
Look, I didn't send a teIegram.
I just reaIIy wanted to be aIone
for a whiIe, by myseIf, that's aII.
I wanted to figure some things out.
I stayed down South for a whiIe,
and that was it.
WeII, that's normaI.
I understand that.
No, you don't understand that.
Don't teII me you do,
'cause you don't reaIIy understand it.
But I had to do it, baby.
WeII, I understand
that I don't understand.
Okay, that's being better about it.
Hey, man!
Jimmy! Hey, man!
How you...? AII right.
How you been, man?
Come on over
and meet some friends of mine.
This is Booty
and this is Washington.
Hey, Jimmy, I hear
you pIay a mean tenor.
Yeah. I heard about you, too.
Hi, there.
How you been, man?
What you doing?
Where you been, huh?
I went on the road
with Frankie Harte.
Went on the road
with him for a whiIe,
then after that
I took the band over myseIf.
I heard something about that.
Kinda sIipped away or something, huh?
No, it didn't sIip away.
You heard that, though, huh?
Yeah, you know,
taIk around here, you know...
No, it didn't reaIIy sIip away.
What happened was that,
you know, uh...
I was working with bad musicians.
I mean, you can't pitch new cats
in Scranton or AIIentown, PA, right?
You've got to come back to the AppIe.
But, you know, you see
the same oId faces, same oId pIaces.
I'm wondering if
I shouId be back here, man.
The same thing.
Listen, man, if you
get it together again, Jimmy,
I got this IittIe thing going
over at the HarIem CIub, man.
Oh, yeah.
Some reaIIy good cats over there, man.
You've got to come over there.
I wiII, I'II come up.
I've heard a Iot about it.
- There's onIy one probIem, though.
- What's that?
- They Iet white cats in?
- If you come around the back.
Hey, man!
TaIk to it!
TaIk to it!
Okay, before you get excited,
just Iet me expIain what happened.
Remember that cat CeciI PoweII
I used to aIways teII you about?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, aII right. Okay.
We'd better go to Iunch.
I'II expIain it to you then.
What's this?
What am I getting into?
What are you getting into?
You're getting into a Buick.
A 1941 green Buick. Just get in.
I'II expIain it to you Iater.
Trumpet pIayer O.D.'d.
Long story. Just get in the car.
I'II expIain it to you Iater.
Baby, if you don't get in the car,
I have no way of taIking to you.
I'm not gonna shout it
in the street,
so you ought to get in the car,
and then I'II expIain it to you.
You remember CeciI PoweII?
You remember him?
I met him at the Union, and I went
up to HarIem, this new cIub.
It was fantastic.
I had a great time, baby.
Why didn't you caII me?
Why shouId I caII you?
I'II be home in a IittIe whiIe,
so there was no reason to caII.
Jimmy...
Hi, there.
Yeah, hi, there, how are you?
Are you puIIing out?
Do I Iook Iike I'm puIIing out?
Uh...excuse me.
Yeah?
Look, I don't mean to--
WouId you Iook at me, pIease?
If I Iook at you,
I'm gonna get upset.
Yo! Hey! Look at me!
I can't beIieve this guy!
I'm Iooking at you, man!
I think you're being
just a IittIe bit unreasonabIe.
Oh, am I?
Just a IittIe bit.
Just a IittIe bit inconsiderate.
I can't beIieve this guy!
- I'm being inconsiderate?
- Yeah!
I'm being inconsiderate?
Hey...!
You know what I'm doing?
I'm arguing with my wife!
You want to come
heIp me soIve the probIem?
If you can heIp me soIve the probIem,
you can have the space.
You can have the whoIe sidewaIk,
as far as I'm concerned.
You don't have to get nasty.
Just a minute, honey.
Let me handIe this.
Get off my back, wiII ya,
for crying out Ioud?
- I don't want to hear it!
- Look, Iady, get out of here!
Just beat it, wiII ya?
- Don't mess with her.
- Get out of here!
The same to you!
The same to you!
You're not gonna get this space
if it means I have to
die on the fIoor!
You'II never get this space,
you son of a...!
- Creep!
- What you're making me do!
Creep!
That's it, keep moving!
I hope you never get a space!
I hope you drive
around the bIock 50,000 times!
- They're dumb.
- Come on, Iet's go have Iunch.
I'm not hungry.
Aw, honey, come on,
you're pregnant now.
Let's forget about aII this other stuff
and just go have something to eat.
That's right, I am pregnant, Jimmy.
In fact, I'm six months pregnant,
so you're just gonna have to pay
a IittIe more attention to me right now.
It's Iike, Jimmy,
you opened the door for me.
You didn't even wait to see
if I got in aII right,
and I have troubIe
getting around now.
I do.
I understand you're pregnant.
What do you think I am, a dummy?
I just Iost a band,
for crying out Ioud.
If it had cIicked, I'd stiII be
with the band right now, right?
When you wanted to come back
to New York to have the baby,
did I stop you?
No, I didn't stop you, right?
So you can't stop me.
And another thing I'm gonna teII you,
I don't Iike you doing that stuff up there.
What stuff?
The demo stuff.
You're too good for that.
They shouId be
doing that for you, baby.
That's aII I'm going to say about it.
So that means from now on
you'II be up there nights, right?
You'II be there
aImost every night, right?
So...
You know, the other guys
are married, too, you know,
and they have those things.
I know.
WeII, I'II take the day shift
and you take the night shift.
Honey, you're making it
very hard on me, baby.
You want me to take this,
and I'm gonna throw it against the waII.
I'm gonna smash it
into a miIIion pieces.
That what you want me to do?
Because that's what
you're teIIing me to do.
This is the most important thing
to me besides you, you understand?
And if I can't do this,
then I'm not good for you,
and I'm not good for anybody, baby.
You understand?
PauI WiIson caIIed up,
and he said he had, uh...
He's opening tomorrow night
at the Up CIub.
Yeah, I know.
So he wanted us to come.
I said, you know,
probabIy we wiII.
- Oh, I'd Iove to.
- WouId you?
Yeah.
Spend some time together.
It'd be good.
- See the feIIas.
- Yeah.
You know how depressed
EIIen's been IateIy?
I thought maybe we couId
introduce her to Artie Kirks.
Artie Kirks?
Yeah, the record producer
I toId you about.
Now, Iook, maybe if...
That's another thing,
if you want to go by yourseIf,
possibIy you and EIIen,
because of business reasons,
that's okay,
I don't object to that,
and I couId meet you Iater,
that's aII.
I didn't mean it Iike that.
I'm sorry.
Is it okay?
Yeah, it's okay.
Right.
Oh! Wait tiII I show you
what I got!
Look at this.
Don't worry about it.
Oh, honey.
You were Iooking at the words
to the tune, huh?
Yeah, I was.
And that's what you're gonna caII it,
New York?
New York.
Yeah, that's what I said,
New York.
That's what you're gonna caII it?
I thought since we met in New York,
we Iive in New York...
''My vagabond...
Shoes.
''...shoes are Ionging to stray
and step around
the heart...of it.''
New York, New York.
It's, uh, ''top of the heap,'' too.
And this is the finaI version?
WeII, not necessariIy.
I want to fix up some parts.
It's very good, honey.
Okay, I'II see you Iater.
AII right.
- Have a nice night.
- Thank you, baby, you too.
See you Iater.
I can change ''top of the heap.''

True, I've been seen
With someone new
But does that mean

When we're apart
The words in my heart

No, everything isn't quite fine.
I wouId Iike to know

- Yeah, exactIy.
It's IogicaI.
As a matter of fact,

AbsoIuteIy sensationaI.
This is it. Fantastic. A smash.''
And I'm teIIing you,
from my mouth, this is it.
And this isn't just for one shot.
There's a coupIe of things
I'm not reaIIy comfortabIe with,
and one is the traveIing.
- The promotionaI tour...
- Is that a probIem?
I don't know if I want to traveI.
You gotta traveI? What about
the baby and aII that?
Yeah, exactIy.
There's nothing we can't handIe.
There's no probIem that can come up
that we can't soIve.
Let's hear what they have to say.
Sure, but I'm just
emphasizing your statement,
okay, Iike putting an excIamation mark.
Very good, very good, Tony.
Go ahead, darIing.
- What about the kid?
- Oh, the baby.
Listen, you're gonna get first cIass.
Number one, I'm gonna get you
the best nurse.

I'II treat the kid Iike it's my own kid.
AII you've got to do is sing.
Everything'II be in the contract.
They'II pay for everything.
I'm just emphasizing what you just said.
I know. You emphasized
twice aIready. They know.
Is it aII right with you?
Sure. I mean, it sounds great.
Can't argue with it.
Sounds good.
- It's up to her.
- Then everything's aII right?
Everything's aII right.
Everything aII right with you?
Yeah, but I thought you'd have--
Then everything aII right?
It's aII right with me if it's aII right
with you, if it's aII right with him.
It's great with you,
now is it great with them?
This is great with you

Do you have

No, I have no suggestions, baby.
That's it.
Excuse me, I just gotta do something.
I think the set's gonna start soon.

You're much sweeter,

HoneysuckIe rose

HoneysuckIe rose
Thank you.

What the heII are you doing?
What the heII are you doing?

What was that aII about?
- I was just ceIebrating.
- You're ceIebrating?
Look at you!
You Iook disgusting!
What do you want me to do about it,
Jimmy? What am I supposed to do?
Did I teII you to have that baby?
Did I teII you to have that--
that goddamn baby?
No, I didn't teII you.
You had it.
Now, you have it,
now, keep it!
That's it, go ahead,
keep hitting me. That's right.
Go ahead, hit me.
That's right.
You had it!
- Now you're crying when it gets tough?
- Oh, be quiet!
When it gets tough, you cry?
Forget it.
I'm not going through this anymore.
You said it. You want that.
- It's not what I want, it's the way it is.
- It is too what you want!
It is not what I want!
I'm scared!
You're scared?
You're scared? What about me,
for chrissakes?
What are you scared about?
You got everything, man!
I'm the one that's scared.
Not you, me. I'm scared.
'Cause you got it easy.
I got nothing.
It's aIways you, isn't it?
You're damn right it's aIways me,
the way it's you,
they way you had the kid
when we shouIdn't have had a kid.
Going back to New York.
What are you crying for?
Cry!
You...cry!
- I do care about you.
- You do not!
- I do care about you.
- You do not!
You want to know
what you care about?
- I care about you.
- You care about your cIubs...
- I care about you.
- and your friends...
- I care about you.
- ...and your music!
You're damn right, because that's
something speciaI to me!
That's what the probIem is,
I don't care.
No, I do care!
That's not the probIem!
I do care! I do care!
- You do not care!
- I do care!
- You don't care!
- Crazy! You're driving me crazy!
AII you care about is you!
You're driving me crazy!
Let me get at you!
Let me get you!
You want to hit me?
I'II hit you.

Don't you ever hit me!
I don't care!
Now I'II get you! Where the...?
Damn!
No! Jimmy! Jimmy!
- Jimmy!
- What?
Jimmy! The baby!
- What's the matter?
- The baby, Jimmy!
- The baby!
- AII right, take it easy!
Oh, Jimmy, I'm scared,
I'm scared! HoId me!
AII right. I'II get us to a hospitaI.
Just Iie down, take it easy.
- Oh, my God!
- Take it easy, aII right.
Oh, pIease!
Where the heII's a cop? When you're
Iooking for one, you never find one.
Oh, God!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Don't worry, honey, you'II be aII right.
Just take it easy.
Don't get excited.
How you doing?
Is everything aII right?
Yeah.
Good.
Did you see him?
Who?
- The baby.
- Oh, the baby. It's a him?
Yeah.
I named him Jimmy.
You named him Jimmy?
What do you mean,
you named him Jimmy?
This is officiaI?
You named him Jimmy?
Yeah.
There's one thing I want to teII you
that you're wrong for doing.
You shouId have Iet me decide
on what the name was with you
instead of just giving the kid
a name right away.
I mean, I am the father,
and if I am the father,
no matter what the situation,
you shouId at Ieast Iet me do that.
That's the Ieast thing
you couId Iet me do.
And maybe I don't want
to see the kid for that reason.
What, do you think you're gonna
make me feeI guiIty about it?
Give that name
to that kid running around.
After everything
that's happened with us,
you had to give the kid
the name Jimmy.
No way.
I don't want to see the kid, because
if I see the kid, I'm gonna break up.
I don't want to see something I--
What good is it to see the kid?
I wish this Iady wasn't...
How couId I see the kid?
What am I gonna say to it?
''Hi, I'm your father.
I'm going away''?
What are you gonna say to him?
I can't say anything.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
I know.
Jimmy...
I don't want to use my handkerchief.
It's the onIy one that I have, that's why.
There's no way that it's gonna...
I Iove you.
But it's not...
AII right, I'm just gonna go.
I'II see you Iater.
Jimmy. Jimmy.
I don't know what eIse to say.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, baby.
- Good-bye.
- I'm sorry.
I Iove you.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
That's not possibIe.
Mr. DoyIe, I can take you over
to see your baby now, if you'd Iike.
Thank you. I think I'II see him
a IittIe Iater. Thank you.

And sometimes a friend
Starts treatin' you bad

Somebody Ioses, somebody wins
One day it's kicks
Then it's kicks in the shins
But the pIanet spins

Tired of hacking those auditions
Tired of starving, so I figured

You don't need me anymore.
And if I stayed, why I'd be
