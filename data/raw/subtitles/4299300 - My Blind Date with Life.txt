I wish my days away, it's true

Every day, every night,
I can't get you off my mind

You follow me and do everything
just like me. Yes?
Always away from you,
it seems I'm just passing through

My mind is a one way track,
it's gone too far, no turning back...

frisee and sugar snap peas.
Enjoy your meal.
Not bad for an intern.
(young man) My name is
Saliya Kahawatte.
I once read a sentence
from a guy called Buddha.
"There is no path to happiness.
Happiness is the way."
From today's perspective
I completely agree with him.
But Buddha or no Buddha,
This path really didn't have to be
had to be so damn rocky.
I was even allowed to serve guests.
They never allow interns to do that.
The personnel manager said,
if I want to do the apprenticeship there,
their doors would be more than open.
That sounds really great.
- Stop it, he's bursting with pride.
He can be proud,
if he owns the hotel.
This is our impoverished nobility
from Sri Lanka.
What kind of napkin origami is this?
- Classic: the bishop's mitre.
What is it?
(Sali?
All good.
"The Metamorphosis" is a
story from the year 1912
by Franz Kafka.
Um... the...
Sorry.
The...
(Students laugh)
(Teacher) Well, Saliya,
can't you decipher the writing?
You're making a fool of yourself here.
Sit down.
(clacking)
(Can you recognize anything?
No, too blurred.
Is it getting better?
No.
(quiet piano music)
(steps)
Sali, will you please come?
You can sit down here.
Our investigations have shown that
that you suffer from a bilateral
congenital eye disease.
Unfortunately, this has
due to complications
to a retinal detachment
in a very short time.
You have lost 80% of your eyesight.
Your optic nerve is also defective
and hardly transmits any impulses.
We have to operate,
to preserve at least a small part
of your eyesight.
(quiet piano music)
(Door closes.)
(She sobs.)
At least I have 5% left.
I'm not completely blind.
I was even lucky.
I'll help you where I can.
(Sali) I don't go to a special school.
I want to do my Abitur here,
at a normal school.
And then the hotel management apprenticeship.
That was always my plan.
Just because of my shitty eyes
I'm not giving it up.
Read.
Read to me.
Come on, I want you to read to me.
(father) Normal school!
But you are not normal.
Promise me that I
I can stay at my school.
Yes, I promise you that.
(The chain rule again.
Y equals e to the power of 4x
plus 2.
We substitute 4x plus 2 with u,
the outer function
y equals e to the power of u.
You let me know,
if I'm going too fast, Saliya, right?
I will, Mr. Dönges, thank you.
The outer derivative
therefore remains y equal to e to the power of u,
while the inner derivative of 4x plus 2
is 4.
(Classmate) What's he talking about?
(rattling, clattering)
(chewing, scratching, rustling)
I don't get it.
(distorted voices)
(Dönges)
...equal to e to the power of 4x plus 2 times 4...
That is, y dash...
- ...equal to e...
...equal e...
- ...high a...
(Sali)...high u...
...times 4.
Another number as a factor...
- Another number as a factor...
Don't you want to take a break?
You're already tired.
Taking a break
I can also take a break after graduation. Go on.
Two breaks...
- Two breaks...
The sum...
(The sum...
...of Arcus-Sinus and Arcus-Cosinus...
(Sali joins in)
...is constant...
(Sali)...is constant...
...and amounts to...
(Sali)...and amounts to...
With all due understanding, Saliya,
but does it really help? This...
...mumble after?
Um...
The derivative of the arc sine of x
is 1 divided by the square root of 1
minus x squared.
This means that the sum
of arc sine and arc cosine of x
is constant and amounts to...
...Pi Halbe.
Or also 1.570796327.
Yes... then we'll continue.
Mom? Sheela?
(quiet piano music)
I got my high school diploma.
2,7.
(indifferent) Congratulations.
I've probably gone blind,
so I don't have to see you anymore.
(Sali) I am hereby applying
for an apprenticeship in your hotel.
I used to spend a lot of time abroad.
Even then, I had already decided
"hotel management assistant".
This summer I graduated from
at the Kant-Gymnasium in Neustadt
passed with 2.7.
Unfortunately I was diagnosed with
diagnosed with an eye condition,
that severely restricts my vision.
Nevertheless, I did my Abitur
at a completely normal school.
Training with my disability
will not be easy,
but I will do everything I can to make it happen.
"We are sorry,
to have to send you a rejection.
We have chosen from many applications
for other candidates."
Because disabled people are difficult to dismiss,
they are not hired.
5-star hotel. Mr. Kahawatte.
Be realistic.
Given the severity of your disability
are only a training
as a telephone operator or masseur
in a disabled-friendly
facility.
I can only advise you:
Stop dreaming. Huh?
How is that supposed to work?
Should I perhaps
get a dream disability?
(lively music)
You are applying to a 5-star hotel
and want to keep it quiet?
Yes, there's no other way.
I want to lead the life
that I want to lead.
Without people saying,
I can't do that with my disability.
(PC voice) Privately run since 1841, the award-winning
and multiple award-winning
Bayerische Hof with 340 rooms
is an institution
among luxury hotels.
The live entertainment is legendary...
(further information fast forwarded)
(Eye contact.
That is the most important thing.
And don't forget,
keep talking to me.
Okay.
So, Mr. Kahawatte,
So you want to
complete an apprenticeship with us?
That is my wish, yes.
That's why I applied to you.
That's too low.
15% higher, then you have the eyes.
Yes, perfect.
And now keep making eye contact.
Okay.
So you are ready,
always be equally friendly,
no matter how a guest treats you?
I will read his every wish
from the sound of his voice.
Very good.
Then I would like to welcome you to our company.
Thank you.
You have to shake my hand.
Stick it out first,
so that the other person has to take it.
Again.
Then I would like to welcome you to our company.
I want you to shake my hand,
not my breast.
Sorry.
(quiet music)
(traffic noise)
(streetcar bell)
(Music stops.)
(Sheela) So once again: entrance, revolving door.
Then 12 o'clock,
20 steps to the passage.
Then 45 degrees left
and another 10 steps to the sofas.
Then I stop and wait,
until the HR manager approaches me.
Perfect. Good luck.
(quiet piano music)
No matter what happens, we love you.
(The music speeds up.)
(The music stops abruptly.)
(Here. See you later.
(loud footsteps, rattling)
(babble of voices)
Mr. Kahawatte?
Fried. I am the HR manager.
- Thank you for the invitation.
While we're talking,
I'll show you the hotel.
You graduated from high school. Why did
you decide not to study?
I have decided FOR an apprenticeship
in your company.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Max Schröder.
- Our appointment was over an hour ago.
Yes, I know, but a truck
crashed into the streetcar.
It derailed
and got stuck in a building entrance.
Full closure.
You may have heard this on the radio.
I heard.
Hello.
(quietly) Thank you.
Well then, come with us.
We'll start at the top.
After the internship
you made the decision,
to work in a 5-star hotel?
Actually much earlier. When I was 14.
My father comes from Sri Lanka.
We often visited his brother,
who works in a big hotel there.
What fascinated you so much about it when you were 14?
I grew up in Neustadt.
Not exactly the big world.
I had the feeling in the hotel
that the whole world comes together there.
The different languages,
cultures, religions, clothing styles.
And everyone is respectful
and polite to each other.
Just as it should be,
as it should be everywhere in the world.
This way, Mr. Kahawatte.
Everything okay?
- Thank you.
So, this is one of our suites.
Housekeeping would be
also one of your training...
...stations.
IF we take you...
Mr. Schröder.
Have you seen these?
It's a blast, isn't it?
(loud whirring)
(Fried) In the kitchen area
you will learn the basics
for upscale gastronomy.
(Chef) Two black-feathered chicken,
one veal fillet, one king bream.
Quickly.
(Yes, sir.
(instructions)
(kitchen noises)
Yes? No? Kiss my ass?
(Yes!
- That's pretty cool, isn't it?
Our hotel has always been your dream?
Always have been.
- Even at 14, like Mr. Kahawatte?
Yes, of course.
Our head chef, Mr. Krohn.
Hello.
- Hello.
He worked for a long time
worked on a cruise ship for a long time.
Hence his strict regiment here.
Finally, I will show you
one of our restaurants.
15 tables, almost always fully booked.
It's really busy every evening.
Mr. Kleinschmidt manages the restaurant
the restaurant and the adjoining bar.
(soft violin music)
(Kleinschmidt)...third warning.
From tomorrow you can finish your training
in a youth hostel.
He really takes a lot of time
for the trainees.
Do you have a moment?
It's about tonight.
Wait here.
We'll continue with you in a moment,
Mr. Schröder.
I don't know what it is,
but there's something wrong with you.
You said it was always your dream
to work in this hotel.
That was a lie.
Because if it really was your dream,
you wouldn't be wearing the smoky clothes
from last night.
And not drunk through,
which you can smell despite the probably 20
"Fisherman's Friend" smells.
Shit.
You wouldn't have ended up
ended up with a girl.
Which is surely the reason
for your delay.
Where do you want...
- Perfume.
Unless you're into it yourself
"Little Princess" by Vera Wang.
Are you the Indian Rainman or what?
A normal nose is enough.
It may be that all this
Mr. Fried has not noticed.
But if he does, he will 100%
want to know why exactly this hotel?
When it's always been your dream.
(quietly) Fuck.
Built in 1841.
Just two years later, so distinguished,
that the king
was a guest twice a month,
because his residence
did not have a bathtub.
Hotel with the highest turnover
in Germany.
Belongs to the
"Leading Hotels of the World.
Where were we? Oh yes, your dream.
What do you want
be on your business card?
"Hotel manager".
And why exactly our house?
Or are you only here
because your father sent you here?
That has nothing to do with it.
I'm talking about the Bayerischer Hof.
Multiple top-selling hotel.
One of the "Leading Hotels of the World".
Even the king comes to bathe.
Cam.
- Kam.
Come with us.
Mr. Schröder, will you wait here, please?
Have a seat, Mr. Kahawatte.
I like what you
about the hotel in Sri Lanka.
Unusual answer.
You want this
with all your heart, don't you?
Yes.
I consider you
as an honest person.
This makes you a good fit for our company.
What is it?
Mr. Kahawatte?
Nothing.
- Well then.
I look forward
to welcome you to our company.
(Music: "Take Me High"
by Roland Spremberg)
Thank you.
Take a seat.
They took me.
- What?
They thought I could see normally.
Give me the strength to rearrange

Modest view.
Be glad you can't see anything.
Well...
Okay, so,
now 28 more steps to the traffic lights.
Turn left at the traffic lights.
Then continue straight on to the stop
and there you can
take any streetcar.
They all stop after five stations
directly in front of the Bayerischer Hof.
So.
(traffic light signal)
(Tram rings.)
(Sheela) This is the last street
before the entrance.
Stage.
There are about 30 people standing there.
(babble of voices)
Now you have to manage on your own.
- Yes...
(quietly) You can do it.
Good luck.
- Thank you.
(The babble of voices gets louder.)
Hey, Sali. Well?
From now on it gets serious.
Never sleep in again.
Are we complete?
Please follow me.
Let's go.
Dear trainees, we have selected you
from almost 300 applicants,
because we believe
that you have talent for this profession.
The task now is
make something of the talent.
From now on you represent
the Bayerischer Hof.
Its tradition, its reputation
and especially how we treat our guests,
who is always the center of attention.
Be aware
aware of this responsibility.
Of course, not everyone will
go through everything at the same time.
That's why we divide you into groups.
Mrs. Riedinger?
Hannah Kümmerle...
- Yes.
Saliya Kahawatte,
Tim Wasmuth,
Irina Saizew-Müller,
Jala Asgari and Max Schröder.
You start your training with me.
Follow me.
(Music: "Nothin' To Lose"
by Vincent Stein/Konstantin Scherer)
♪ Sometimes you feel like
you got nothing to lose
Follow me
♪ If you got nothing to choose
Follow me
(Riedinger) So, and now
I'll show you again,
how to fold a hospice corner.
And that, Mr. Schröder,
I never want to see that again.
Should I ever catch one of you
ever catch one of you sitting down,
we have a problem with each other.
Watch carefully.
You don't learn that at vocational school.
Like this! And finally
take a step back
and look at the room
through the eyes of the guest.
It looks difficult at first,
but in a few weeks
create the room
in less than an hour.
So, let's try it out.
Each of you gets a room.
Because it's your first day,
you have two hours.
Follow me, please.
(squeaking)
(distant siren)
(Sali quietly) Man,
That's not possible!
Why doesn't it go away?
I knew
something was wrong with you.
What have you got?
- Why?
Dude, I've seen the magnifying glass.
Retinal detachment.
I only see 5% of what you see.
Practically nothing.
And you didn't say anything?
Would you have taken me then?
Nope.
- You see. So please don't tell anyone.
I can't do that.
I have to tell Mrs. Riedinger.
I can't cover up fraud.
Dude, I know,
you can't do it, but...
You should see yourself now!
Dude, awesome!
Man, of course I don't tell anyone.
I'm not an ass.
I'll help you with the mirror.
So what you need...
...are fresh towels.
Not this mini flap here.
And lots of glass cleaner.
(Sali coughs.)
Apply in large quantities.
So, towel one.
Use this to dry off. Here.
And then polish with the second one.
If the mirror is clean,
you throw the towels
into the laundry chute.
Just don't get caught.
- You know your way around.
My father is in the same business.
He has restaurants.
Is that why you're doing the training?
- Nonsense, on the contrary.
I breezed through my Bachelor's degree twice.
My old man turned off the money tap.
This is the compromise.
I want to and I can't.
And you can, but don't want to.

Eight steps and then six steps.
(Sali counts quietly.)
Sorry, uh, seven steps. I...
(Max clears his throat.)
(Woman speaks Dari.)
Hello.
- How do you do?
You need to acquire knowledge
about cutlery types...
(Sali)...types of cutlery...
You can memorize all that?
- Mmm.
Different types of glass
can be assigned.

Your breakfast is here.
(Will you put it by the window?
- With pleasure.
Good morning to you.
- Good morning to you.
Please let me know
if you need anything else.
All in.
I'm out.
And you have the boy, right?
Please take a look.
I want to see it.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
- Fuck!
How do you know every time
that I'm bluffing?
(He counts quietly.)
(bell)
Housekeeping.
(Groaning in the next room)
Hello? Housekeeping.
(groan)
Hello?
(Oh, the room boy.
- Oh.
I'm sorry about that.
(Hey, Sali!
Max?
Come on in. There's plenty of room here.
(Music: "Blue"
by Reverend and the Makers)
(knocking)
(Housekeeping!
Saliya?
(Music stops.)
You can.
The whole suite in 110 minutes.
Not bad for a trainee.
I was basically
a bit skeptical about you.
But you have really
improved a lot. Congratulations.
Thank you.
("Blue" starts again).
(babble of voices)
(Are there any things left on the grill?
(Max) Quote from Stevie Wonder:
"Better blind than black."
Not good?
- Well...
Someone is watching you.
- Who is?
No idea. One of the dishwashers.
Make it faster.
Max, get the trolley with the dirty dishes
from the return.
Clean it up properly,
otherwise we'll all get into trouble here.
Do you have problems with your eyes?
Let me know if I can help you.
Thank you.
Where are you from?
- Afghanistan.
What brings you here?
I have fled. From Kabul.
I worked in a hospital there.
Formerly a surgeon, now a dishwasher.
Hey, Hamid! You're not here
to chat! Go back and do the dishes!
Let him talk.
The main thing is that I'm in Germany
and AOK-insured.
Come on, guys, let's hurry up!
And?
- Surgeon from Kabul.
He knows about it and wants to help me.
And Kawasaki, you take out the trash.
Yes, what is it? Don't fall asleep!

- Exactly.
And that's how you know
that this is the woman of your life?
Exactly.
What if she is insanely ugly?
I don't care.
That's right, you don't see them anyway.
She can't be ugly,
with that voice.
Watch out for the puddle! Another one, another one.
Yes!
- Ass.
And now? A "blind date"?

We would like to tell you something pleasant.
The following...
Really?
Me?
Yes, of course I'm coming up.
See you soon.
Hey, Kahawatte.
Jump in for me for a minute.
The organic farm will be here soon.
I have to go to the personnel office.
I'll be right back.
- No problem.
(Morning.
(rattling)
Where is Bernd?
In the personnel office. I'm standing in for him.
Okay.
Shall we get started?
- Yes.
Thank you.
I'm Sali, by the way.
- I am Laura.
Are you new here?
- I'm just starting my training.
Fresh from the foil. So to speak.
Sali is an unusual name.
Comes from Saliya.
Is a Sinhalese name.
It's called "The Pious" or something like that.
You're from Sri Lanka?
- My father.
I come from the deepest province.
Neustadt... an der Eisch.
Also nice.
- Mmm.
Also nice.
So the pious one?
Yes.
(If I find out who that was,
I'll pull his ears out!
Bag rats!
- What's going on?
"Employee of the month".
I am supposed to pick up my certificate
in person to collect my certificate.
I'm still falling for it too.
I'll continue. Thank you.
- With pleasure.
Fried looked at me,
as if I...
completely crazy...
...become...
(Sali?
Oh, I... have to go back.
- Sali!
Ciao! Nice to have met you.
Likewise.
Bye bye.
(Music: "Endlessly" by Michael Geldreich)
Sali, ten minutes ago you were supposed to
cutting mortadella for the buffet.
You know the slicer?
On, off, set the thickness.
Here is the mortadella, very simple.
I want to be able to read the
to read the newspaper, right?
(Machine whirring.)
Not like that.
How deep is it?
- Not so bad.
Hamid, bandages!
- Yes!
Bandages! Bandages!
(Sali gasps in panic.)
When was the last tetanus?
- I have no idea.
(Hamid) We'll stop the blood
the blood for now.
Hi, I want to see you today
after work today. Got it?
(groan, impact)
(Get out of here.
(Man ♪2) Have a nice evening.
It'll be fine.
Have a nice end to the day.
- Likewise.
(clearing throat)
Sali?
Can you come here, please?
(rattling)
Okay, what's wrong with you?
You have two options:
You tell me what's going on,
or you don't have to come back.
I have a problem with my retina.
I have very poor vision.
How bad?
5% of what you see,
and it's even blurred.
Why are you hiding it?
Because as a "visually impaired" person
nobody gave me a chance.
I can't be responsible
that an accident like this happens here.
We dismantle the slicing machine
I'll explain it,
you put them back together again
and then you control them.
Yes?
Thank you.
- Come.
So, first reach for the cable.
Unplug. This comes out here,
on the side. Unplug.
Never reach in here.
Always keep your hand outside.
On the cutting blade
always from the inside to the outside.
Now loosen the slide.
Remove the top.
There is a thorn in the center,
that has to go into the hub.
Now in the middle. Very nice.
(snappy music)
Sali, that's enough.
Hmm?
And?
- Pretty.
But not so pretty,
that she's just pretty.
Next.
- Slim. Beautiful, defined arms.
Probably from milking cows on the organic farm.
Next.
- Not too big.
Blonde hair. Plait.
Perfect.
She smiles a lot. And...
...and she has a boyfriend.
What?
- Sorry.
And you're quite sure?
Well, yes. Still making out.
Come on, let's wash it down.
(Dance music)
Everyone has several great loves in life.
Do you agree with me?
Probably already.
You just have to quickly
move on to the next great love.
Is it that simple?
- It is as simple as that.
Maybe it's one of the two,
looking over at us.
Yes, yes.
Yes, I swear. 14:00.
(girl) Tonight I'm going to
the Indian at the bar!
One of them wants to
"the Indian" tonight.
It's perfect.
Firstly, I am not Indian,
secondly, I am still officially in mourning,
and thirdly, she has bad luck
with her voice.
Objection rejected.
Okay, she's coming.
Green cocktail dress. Red hair.
(I would prefer blondes.
You are blind.
Are you still making demands or what?
Hello with a double O!
My name is Max, this is Sali.
Hi, I'm Tina.

(She groans.)
(Do anything with me,
anything you want, yes?
(She moans lasciviously.)
(loud groan)
(She moans lustfully.)
What's going on?
Nothing. Everything is great.
Oh God. Oh God.
(Oh God! Oh God!
Oh God.
(pointed groan)
(shrill groan)
(She screams.)
Oh God...
(We're waiting, Mr. Schröder.
First the primary flavors please.
(Max sniffs audibly.)
(Earth...
...bears.
Bears?
Well, we have berry flavors
in just about every wine.
This can certainly be made even more specific.
(silently)
Earth bears?
That's right. What else?
We are waiting.
Violets?
Not bad, Mr. Schröder. Please.
Scallops, how long?
Done.
- Out.
Two lamb shanks?
- Three minutes, boss.
Sali, get out the dirty sauté pans.
Sautéed vegetables, polenta, how long?
As good as finished!
Good, polenta in three minutes for me.
Max! The salmon!
Let's go! It has to go in the pipe!
Jan shows you how to fill it.
Properly scaled? Sloppy!
(So, Tim...
(Hamid) Oh, boss is here.
Jala. Hannah. It was nice.
- Thank you very much.
Irina. Good.
- Thank you very much.
Next stop is reception?
- Yes.
I'll stick with the sink.
Good luck.
Thank you.

The service shows a good hotel:
They start,
before the first guest has arrived,
and you stay,
when the last guest has left.
You are always there,
when a guest needs you,
Silently, unobtrusively and above all:
with a smile.
Remember:
The smile comes from the heart,
the guest knows,
that you love your job.
And I will neither be sloppy
nor unpunctuality nor laziness
tolerate anything else,
that damages the reputation of the hotel.
The men fetch the drinks,
and the ladies sort them.
Hm! Delicious, delicious, delicious.
Sali, can you help me?
What's up? The authorities again?
- Yes, another letter.
Salim aleikum.
- Greetings.
So. "Dear Mr. Hamid Mousafa,
regarding our letter
regarding your request
for the review of the opposition
to the request for change
of the current...
of the current
employment relationship..."
Laura waved.
You didn't wave back.
Now I've waved for you.
Now she's gone.
- Where has she gone?
I went out.
- I'll be right back.
(pain sound)
Whew!
Fuck.
Laura?
Hamid said that you waved.
I didn't see it.
Okay.
What are you doing with Hamid?
- I'm helping him with letters from the office.
He is a doctor and now wants to
apply for a job as a paramedic.
But according to his passport
he is only allowed to work as a dishwasher.
Complicated.
How are you?
Quite good. And you?
Good.
How are things going with... Irina?
You are a couple, aren't you? Aren't you?
Nope. Definitely not.
Not a couple.
By mutual agreement. Not a couple.
And you? How's it going with your...
...colleagues?
Um... separated.
Not by mutual agreement.
Oh...
I'm sorry about that.
- Don't be, it was an ass.
That's a bit off the hip, but...
Do you want to have dinner with me?
What makes you think that?
Uh, I...
- No, that was just a joke.
Tomorrow? You choose the restaurant?
Uh...
I can't make it tomorrow evening.
Um, Saturday?
Good. Nice.
See you then.
(quiet instrumental music)
We fill the long drink glass
carefully with the bar tongs
with a few ice cubes.
(Ice jingles.)
Now the measuring cup, called a jigger.
Add 1.5 cl of vodka one after the other,
white rum,
Tequila, gin,
2 cl Cointreau,
and a dash of lemon juice...
...into the ice-cold shaker.
Put the lid on.
Shake vigorously with a few
defined movements.
Take the strainer and strain.
Fill the rest of the glass
with cola,
Cut off the lemon zest and roll,
a splash, turn out.
Two lemon slices for decoration,
Straw,
Stirrer.
And then...
...we serve the Long Island Ice Tea.
We swipe the card
through the cash register,
Select table,
You will find the numbers on the list,
and then
print and file the receipt.
Any questions?
Voilà. My old man's restaurant.
Go ahead and look around.
(Max laughs)
(Sali) 8962 Campari Soda.
Classic... Mojito.
Cuba... libre.
How much cl there?
4 cl white rum...
Cuban rum.
- Yes.
12 cl cola and two limes.
(Sali joins in).
One, two, three...
- Stop! Stop.
Too much.
Again.
(Okay, so...
(quietly) One, two...
Hm, almost!
(burping)
- What if we do take water?
Nonsense.
Water has a different physical density
than vodka. So, once again.
Okay, so. One, two...
Clean!
(Max) And again for practice.
One, two...
- Good.
One, two...
Very good.
Fantastic.
(Sali counts.)
- I'm proud of you, mom.

Menu and wine list.
You can memorize it at home.
Thank you.
- Will you pick them up?
Too complicated. And too much risk.
I ask her if we can meet here.
Wouldn't it be easier
if you told her the truth?
Then it's all about that.
And I don't want a first date,
where it's all about blindness.
Then I might as well forget it.
- But when are you going to tell her?
I have no idea.
Definitely not on the first date.
Don't look at me so skeptically.
I don't.
I look at a girl on the street.
You don't.
- Well.
You know what?
Order gnocchi with tomato sauce.
They can be eaten "blind".

The risottos are great.

How long have you been working on the farm?
About three years.
Before that, I lived in the city.
Do you like it?
So, do you have nice bosses?
Very nice. They are my parents.
The farm belongs to your parents?
- Yes, I grew up there.
And you went back again?
Yes, it wasn't my dream idea,
to live with my parents again,

That was the best option.

do it again.
Did you understand that, Kahawatte?
Yes.
- Good.

Ready?
- Almost.
You stay here,
until you have learned.
Come on.
(loudly) All over again!
Give it to me.
Nope, not again, Kahawatte.
Again.
No. Tell me if it's clean.

You will be able to tell
whether a glass is clean or not?
I don't know.
- What?
I don't know. I am tired.
I can't take any more!
You keep going until you know.
Do it all again. Rinse and polish.
Oh, and one more thing, Kahawatte.

Can you not control yourself with guests

This is the first warning.
By the third, you're out.

Oskar has a lot of energy.
Laura?
What are you doing there?
I'm sorry,
I thought you were asleep...
Is that what you do with sleeping women?
- No, I...
Sali, you should play along!
Oh, sorry... Your son is calling.
("Hello My Love" continues).
(cheering)
I will, my darling.
Oskar wants to ask you something else.
Hey, Oskar.
What's up?
- Are you an alien?
What makes you think that?
Because on your planet
there is no soccer.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not an alien.
- Okay.
And if you do, will you promise me
that you won't eat my mom and me?
I'll even make sure
that no one else eats you.
Okay. I'll go to sleep now.

Well, two people have found each other.
Shall we have another drink?
- Gladly.
(Music gets louder.)
What happened to Oskar's father?
- No more contact.
Oh.
- Yes.
At first he was all fired up,
and then when Oskar arrived,
he wanted his old life back.
He has moved to Berlin.
No longer in touch.
That's great.
- It's easier without him than with him.
And I no longer have to
about his constant lying.

Now for the main course.
The basic principle here is the same:
Never pass food over the guest's plate.
Always keep
the service direction...
It's your first day at the restaurant
and you're late.
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't hear the alarm clock.
This is your second warning.
This time you will receive it in writing.
You are one step
before the red line.
What is that?
What about your tie, Kahawatte?
Should we call you a tie in future?
Would that be easier? Hm?
Just for you.
(loudly) What did you say?
It makes it easier for you.
I hope you have no problem
with heartfelt dislike.
No problem. I know it from home.
You should feel at home.
Now to the next point:
Setting a table.

and valuables.
He has also

Mom needs a job,
to pay off the loans on the house.
Which won't be so easy.
Dad never wanted me to work.
- I know that.
Can I help you?
Pass your training.
Then I'll have one less thing to worry about.
Sorry.
I can transfer 200 euros
from my salary
and look for a part-time job.
Hamid also works at a bakery.
How is that supposed to work?
You're already totally overworked.
I can manage that.

who wants this job more than I do.
Now I think I have
already met this person.
Thank you.
Her flair for wine is excellent.
You can start with me in the restaurant.
With additional training as a sommelier.
That makes me incredibly happy.
But I can't accept your offer
unfortunately not accept.
I'm planning something of my own with Max.
They never cease to amaze me,
Kahawatte.
Well then. Good luck.
You have really earned it.
- Thank you very much.

And...
Hooked on a feeling
♪ I'm high on believing
# That you're in love with me
Lips as sweet as candy
Its taste is on my mind
(Sali) As the saying goes: if you want to go fast
walk fast, it is best to walk alone.
But if you want to go far,
is best done in good company.
I've always been
more the long-distance type.
Here you go.
♪ I just stay a victim
♪ If I can for sure
Can I help you?
Laura?
I tried to explain to Oskar
why we don't see each other anymore.
He then said,
He would have lied once, out of fear,
I wouldn't love him anymore.
Looks like you could use some help.
And how.
Good.
(Music: "Tomorrow's Calling You")
I think Sali is having
the best moment of his life.
(ringing)
A gift from us.
What is that?
A ball with a bell in it.
To play soccer for the blind.
It might be more fun that way.
Comm.
I'm stepping on your toes.
I have two eyes.
They're enough for both of us.
