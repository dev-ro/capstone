Wait!
Are you looking at me?
Hey!
My hair!
Police!
Somebody help!
Wait, the bus!
You're late, Pecker.
Sorry, Mr. Bozak.
l was taking pictures.
Late is late no matter what.
Finish this order.
l'll be right there.
You got customers.
Here, Miss Emily.
Don't forget to come to my show.
Remember,
this ain't no art gallery.
lt's a restaurant.
Your friends better
buy something tomorrow...
or l'll throw them out.
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Asshole.
Hope to see you tomorrow.
Bye.
Here you go, Pecker-man.
Special delivery.
Where'd you get this?
l got myself
a five-finger discount.
Dude, you're gonna get popped.
Not me, bro.
l'm invisible.
Ready to play?
Shopping for others!
Hey, you! Brats.
Next in line, please.
Would you hurry up, please?
This is not mine.
l don't care if it's not--
This is not mine.
l wouldn't eat these rice cakes.
What is this?
l didn't buy this.
There's nothing wrong
with my butt.
Watch your mouth.
l don't eat meat.
l'm a vegetarian.
l'll be right with you.
Hold on.
l'm sorry.
Void that receipt.
lt's OK, ma'am.
Just a minute.
What's going on?
Some jerk
in the produce department.
Hey, you!
Stop, thief! Somebody help me.
You gonna pay for that?
Hi, Shelley.
l got fluff and fold duties.
Just a few pin-up shots.
You can't work every second
of your life.
But l don't have all day
for your stupid art.
l gotta refill
the change machines...
unpack the mini-soaps.
Beautiful.
How could l be beautiful
with all the dirt l put up with?
l don't know, but you sure are.
See him?
Ring around the collar.
Chin up.
Lean into the light.
And her.
You wouldn't believe
the B.O. stains on her blouses.
You're so sexy when you work.
You know that?
How can l be sexy when l know
that she has dingleberries?
She does?
Yes siree, Bob.
You're my Venus de Milo.
You know that?
You're crazy. You see art
when there's nothing there.
Hey, buddy, no sitting
on the washing machines.
You, no slamming doors
on the dryer.
Trying to make me deaf?
One more shot.
Oh, God,
it's a Pecker moment.
Oh, my God.
You can't dye your clothes here!
l don't have any fall colors.
Laundromats have rules.
Can't you read the sign?
Get out, and take your tired
wardrobe someplace else!
You're barred from
the Spin n' Grin Laundromat...
for the rest of your life!
Look.
l killed a worm.
l got you something.
Goody.
Let's say hi to Mom.
l don't know, Joyce.
Miss Betty, l think it looks
very fashionable.
The layered look
is in this year.
Hi, Mom.
Hey, Peck.
What do you think?
Looks cool.
l found a pair
of Calvin Klein underpants, too.
Good for you.
Outsider Al, Miss Betty,
get together.
Come on, Al.
Go on.
There's a good-looking couple.
Fresh!
Sir, everything on that rack
is half price.
Check the tag and divide by two.
Every day is a sale here.
You really know how to make
homeless people feel good...
about how they look.
Thanks, hon. We know how
to make a dollar holler...
here at the Bargain Hut.
You know what l always say.
lf you've got 15 cents
in your pocket...
l can make you look
like a million dollars.
l want more candy.
Little Chrissy,
you just had a candy bar.
Your teeth are gonna rot
out of your head.
l said l want candy!
Don't mind Miss Tooth Decay.
She's all sugared up.
Ain't that a beaut?
Twenty-five cents. Want a bag?
l'll wear it out.
Didn't l say the word ""candy""?
l loved the seventies, too.
Somebody please
give me some candy!
Would you mind taking
Little Chrissy home for me?
She's been aggravating me
all day.
Sure, Mom.
Come on, Little Chrissy.
l thought you could use this
for your show.
Thanks. You rule.
This darn claw machine!
lt's rigged!
You can't be a winner
every time, Guzzles.
Have a drink.
l'm broke, Jimmy.
Your damn claw machine
got all my money.
lt's on me, old-timer.
Thanks.
-Hey, Pecker.
-Hey, Dad.
Afternoon, Guzzles.
Hi, Chrissy. How you doing?
How's it going?
Always got
that broken-down camera...
his mama found
at the thrift shop.
How's my little
sweet tooth today?
Little Chrissy wants a Jolt.
She does?
Slow day?
Slow's not the word.
l got a shot for you.
Put this in your show.
lt's that damn Pelt Room.
How am l supposed to compete...
with a stripper bar
across the street?
Lesbians, l hear.
Showing full bush.
B-E-A-V-E-R.
That's all men want
in a bar these days.
lt says it here...
in the Board of Liquor License
rule book.
'"Section 12-203, paragraph 3.
'"Pubic hair and liquor.""
lt's just plain illegal.
Let's have a big hand,
gentlemen...
for T-Bone the stripper!
She's all lesbian all the time!
That's why we're here!
What are you looking at,
assholes?
The nastiest girl in Baltimore!
Yeah, baby!
Take it off!
That's it! Come on!
l got it!
We show it all!
You like looking at lezzies,
don't you, suckers?
l love it!
Full frontal lesbian nudity!
You think men got
what women really need?
l got it!
Bush City!
You're wrong...
because this beef curtain
stands alone!
Hey, you little Peckerwood!
l was just looking!
There's no free peeking
in the Pelt Room.
l should tell your father!
One pit beef sandwich
with horseradish and ketchup.
l tell my lady friends...
""Give a man
a pit beef sandwich...
'"and he'll be back for seconds.""
Best pit beef in town.
There you go. Bottom round--
just the way you like it.
Four dollars.
Keep the change.
Thank you kindly.
l'll see you tomorrow.
l need to talk to you.
Hi, Memama. How's business?
All Baltimore
loves a pit beef sandwich.
Can l get a shot?
Sure can.
She's doing it again.
She is? When did she start?
Early this morning.
Come in and take her picture
if you don't believe me.
Come on.
You open?
Hold your horses!
-l'm hungry!
-Be right back!
l want my pit beef!
Sometimes there's things
more important than pit beef.
Come on.
She's been a regular
blabbermouth all day.
l can't wait.
Wait till you hear her voice.
There she is.
Hi, Mary.
Full of grace!
See? She's talking.
lt could be a real miracle.
A real miracle.
Full of grace.
You think so?
l do.
l was blinded by the blue
of Mary's cloak...
when l was just seven years old.
l been praying to her
ever since.
Sure has paid off, hasn't it?
lt sure has.
Full of grace.
We hear you loud and clear.
You know what? Why don't
you two sit over there?
Perfect.
You two look like a holy card.
We do?
Wait till you see this picture.
Full of grace.
She likes you!
l like her, too.
Full of grace.
Honey, we're home!
Be right down!
ls Memama up there with you?
We're taking pictures!
She's got customers!
Sweetie, come on. Give it back.
You have to wait
till after dinner.
But l'm hungry now!
Everything always looks good
through here.
Where are you going?
l'm making Sloppy Joes
for dinner.
l can't stay.
You've got to eat.
Why do you think
we called him Pecker?
Never did eat properly
as a child.
Just pecked at his food.
l'm not hungry.
Besides, l'm late for
my photo shoot with Tina.
We love your big sister...
but you know how we feel...
about that place
where she works.
The devil's workshop!
At least they don't
show pubic hair.
That's one good thing.
Honey, don't say ""pubic""
in front of Little Chrissy.
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, sweetie.
Please bring me a soda!
Bye, Dad.
Don't be too late.
Evening, Mr. Nellbox.
-How you doing, daisy bait?
-Good.
Still taking them pictures?
As long as it's OKwith you.
l told your sister Tina...
""Pecker ought to forget
about his stupid camera...
'"get on the bar and dance.""
Show his bony ass,
make some real money.
Thanks, sir,
but l could never do that.
Can l take your picture, though?
Knock yourself out, buttplug.
Hold still.
l'll hold it
any way l can get it.
See you later.
Have a ball, kid.
Here you go, champ.
There you go.
Thanks. Another beer?
Another beer.
Let's hear it
for Larry the Lughead!
Larry's 21 years old...
heterosexual, uncut,
on probation...
and currently makes his living
as a burglar.
Come on, baby!
How about Seafood Sam
the Sailor Man?
He may be straight,
but he's on leave...
so don't ask, don't tell,
just get him to a hotel.
Thar she blows!
Bull's-eye!
Hey, Larry...
No teabagging.
You know the rules.
No balls on foreheads.
Teabagging is forbidden
here at the Fudge Palace.
l understand.
You teabag a customer
one more time...
and Mr. Nellbox
will fire your ass.
You're gonna like this one.
Look at this.
Be careful.
lf it wasn't for you,
Pecker-man...
l'd never know
this shit existed.
'"Teabagging""?
Jesus. l thought
l had heard of everything.
Dude, have you ever heard of
giving someone a Dutch oven?
What's that?
lt's when you fart in bed...
and quickly pull the covers
over your partner's head.
l gotta try that sometime.
Damn.
Look at her.
She's scary.
l don't know.
l think she looks proud.
Whatever it is,
it's a cool fucking picture.
You sure got the eye
for this stuff.
lt's weird.
Sometimes l'm amazed
they even turn out at all.
There's my girl.
Shelley sure is something.
She ought to take off work
once in a while.
Have some fun.
Work is fun, Matt, if you're
doing something you love.
l guess, but look at me.
l'm the best thief in town,
and l can't even get laid.
You hear them footsteps?
lt's her.
Quick. One more shot.
Little Chrissy.
Say, ""Sugar.""
Sugar.
l love you.
No matter what.
This one l like OK.
lt's out of focus...
but it ain't depressing
like the others.
Makes people
feel like buying something.
Can l help you?
They aren't even in color.
You can't look at the pictures
without ordering something.
-l'll have a macaroni salad.
-Right.
Look.
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, honey.
Here you are. Macaroni salad.
Can l get you something?
Hi, Mr. Bozak.
That's all right.
We're just here
to look at the art.
Little Chrissy
can't eat outside food in here.
And they have to buy something.
l'm sorry.
All right.
You can't have it.
Four medium Cokes then.
l want my Jujy Fruits!
We're not allowed outside food.
You're getting a Coke.
We're here to look at art.
Get the Cokes.
Honey, l said--
l want my Jujy Fruits!
You're going to have a Coke
in a minute!
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Here you go, Little Chrissy.
Who's that in the picture?
ls that Little Chrissy?
That's one of my favorite ones,
too.
Sweetie, you are so talented.
lf only you could concentrate on
pretty scenery or something...
instead of our boring lives...
you might make a real career
out of this.
Get back to work.
That's me!
lt's a miracle
they don't take it down.
l know what you mean.
You believe these pictures?
What in the...
l can't figure out
what this one is...
but l kinda like it.
Those homos.
Your pictures are glorious.
There's nothing gay about it.
l'm sorry l'm late...
but wait till you try
this new product.
lt removes lipstick stains,
deodorant rings.
Thanks, honey.
That's really sweet.
Can l take a short break?
lt won't be long.
Come on. Please?
You're off the clock then.
Just for five minutes.
Come on.
And you two, don't even think
about using the rest rooms.
Look. lt's all you, Shelley.
Oh, my God.
You look so pretty.
You don't think l show too much?
That's why they call them
figure studies.
What will my customers say?
They'll say you inspire me.
lt's just me
in my stupid Laundromat.
What's the big deal?
Excuse me.
Are you Pecker?
l am.
l'm Rorey.
-We're his parents.
-Hi.
l'm from New York City
where l have an art gallery.
l'm here to meet
with the Baltimore Museum...
and l saw your flyer.
Your pictures are amazing.
They're the real thing.
Thanks.
This is my girlfriend Shelley.
l love your look.
Tell me about this one.
lt's...
lt's kind of...
lt's the pubic hair
of a stripper!
That's it.
This is a family restaurant,
and you're fired!
l should hope so.
That was disgusting.
Fired?
What did l do?
Chrissy, don't eat that, honey!
Look, Chrissy...
Hurry up! l gotta go!
Go!
Listen to Daddy.
You want to get rickets?
How much?
For my picture?
You wanna buy it?
Of course. lt's great.
-Thirty dollars.
-Sold.
Mom, Dad, l just sold a picture.
l'd also love to give you a show
in my New York gallery.
There you go.
Look.
There's another opening
down the street.
-At Pat Hearn's Gallery.
-Got good reviews.
Why don't we give it a chance?
All right.
That's my little sister.
Some wine?
May l?
Certainly.
lsn't she a doll?
Darling!
My God, you've gotta listen
to what they're saying.
This is The Times.
'"A teenage Ouija...
""who's paintbrush
is the broken-down camera...
""he found
in his mom's thrift shop.""
Lester Hallbrook never raves
about anybody's first show!
He's over there.
Thanks a lot, sir!
You don't have to do that.
Look at this one.
l saw that book at the Strand.
There's Venetia Keydash.
She's a writer for Art News.
l want to introduce you to her.
Your pictures are sublime, son.
Thanks a lot, ma'am.
lf l knew how
to make 'em any better...
they probably
wouldn't work at all.
You know what?
Excuse me a second.
lsn't he gorgeous?
He is.
We don't have boys that cute
in New York.
You having fun, hon?
How could l?
These people
don't go to Laundromats.
They go to dry cleaners.
Here's who l wanna meet.
Shelley, this is one
of the biggest collectors...
of modern photography
in New York, Lynn Wentworth.
You are so sexy, young lady,
and you don't even know it.
Sometimes l know l look good.
You know, Shelley...
she runs a successful Laundromat
in Baltimore.
l know she does, and l bought
all 12 pictures of it.
You did?
One thousand, three hundred
dollars for one picture?
l really didn't do anything.
Here you go. Gypsy, right?
Honey, no.
That's enough chocolate.
We're gonna have
a big fancy dinner soon.
You are rich!
They really are
something special.
Pecker's like
a humane Diane Arbus.
But with a wonderful
streak of kindness.
l'll be right back.
Excuse-moi.
Hi, Mary.
That's me.
l beg your pardon?
l work in a gay bar
in Baltimore.
We call everybody ""Mary.""
You got a little sugar in you,
don't you? Sure. l can tell.
A little light in the loafer.
l don't mean nothing.
l love fags.
l'm Jed Coleman,
curator at the Whitney.
This is Lester Hallbrook
of The Times.
Your brother is a very
talented individual.
You got that, Mary.
l can't believe
you want my autograph.
l don't know.
There you go.
lt looks so fun.
-Let's do it at Balducci's.
-Where's that at?
Wouldn't they just die
at Dean & Deluca's?
ls that a store?
Gourmet anarchy.
You can steal for me any day.
Do you get aroused
when you shoplift?
l guess so.
Would you girls like
to get together later?
l'd like to introduce you
to Redd Larchmont.
Redd!
This is Pecker...
and Shelley, who's so lucky.
Pecker, darling, l must have
""Little Chrissy's Sugar Fix.""
The whole edition
of that one's gone.
Look at ""Rats Make Love.""
lt's one of my favorites.
There's Cindy.
Who?
Cindy Sherman--
the famous photographer?
Right.
Hey, Cindy!
Thank you for coming to my show!
-Hi, Jed. How are you?
-Very nice.
Coming through.
Excuse me!
Ladies and gentlemen,
here she is!
Full of grace.
That's right.
Our Lady herself, Mary--
right here in New York City.
l promise you it'll be OK.
Seriously. l'm Pecker's mother.
lt's fine.
Honey. Hi.
Here. Hold my purse
and watch Little Chrissy for me.
Be right back.
You got spare change?
Spare change?
You poor thing.
You must be so hungry. Here.
Thank you.
Can l have your jacket?
Sure.
Certainly you can.
There you go.
Don't they have good
thrift stores in New York?
No, ma'am.
They're so expensive.
Where l come from, you can get
an Easter outfit for 25 cents.
You can?
Fuckin' lousy art galleries
are ruining this neighborhood!
Stupid blank paintings
and out-of-focus pictures...
and those ugly ass sculptures!
Sir, l understand.
l know.
lt's really hard, isn't it?
lt's hard to appreciate
new things...
if you don't have
the proper outfit to wear.
Take this. Accessorize.
Tie it around your neck.
Don't be afraid of fashion.
That looks wonderful.
lt's a whole new you.
Listen up.
They're having
this artist's dinner...
at this place
called the ""B"" Bar...
after my son's opening.
You all should come.
Free food, and who knows,
maybe you'll get a new outfit.
Excuse me, Lynn.
Shelley,
you're right next to Pecker.
See you later.
l was wondering where you were.
Do you believe this?
We're in a nightclub.
ls this your first time
in New York?
You bet.
ls all this free?
The depth and maturity
of his work.
lt's fantastic.
There's Bryce.
Hi, Collin. Hi, Pat.
Be careful of that guy
over there.
He's from Coagulum.
lt's a magazine.
You're so good.
-Here you are, ma'am.
-How fancy.
For you, miss.
Don't be frightened.
These are just vegetables.
They won't hurt you.
l'd like to propose a toast.
To Pecker:
a brilliant photographer...
a sweet boy,
and a brand-new art star.
To Pecker.
To Pecker!
You have to stand up.
These people are here for you.
-Speak.
-Oh, God.
lt's your night.
l shouldn't have taken off work.
l should be at home
in my Laundromat doing my job.
l'm sure it'll be OK.
Thank you all
for being so nice to me...
and buying my photographs.
l wanna thank Rorey
for liking my pictures...
even though some
are out of focus...
and sometimes l don't
get the exposure right.
You don't know
what my customers are like.
They wait for me to leave town
so they can defy my rules.
You're just imagining things.
l'm not.
People with their dirty laundry
can be animals.
l'd like to toast my dad
for teaching me how far to go.
Take a bow.
He's a great guy, isn't he?
ls it legal to show pubic hair
in New York?
l'm not really sure.
And my grandmother...
for teaching me
to believe in myself...
no matter what anybody said.
She's a real saint.
Full of grace.
My customers will do anything
if l'm not there.
They could be pissing
in my dryers as we speak!
lt's going to be OK.
And my big sister Tina...
for helping me to understand
all types of human behavior.
Come down to Baltimore,
the trade capital of the world!
Thanks, Tina.
And my little sister Chrissy...
Want a Valium, honey?
for teaching me life is nothing
if you're not obsessed.
Honey, you're flinging.
And Matt, the best assistant
a photographer could ever have.
Without him,
l couldn't even do my work.
He's a big help.
And my mom, for helping me
pick out my outfits.
Actually, she helps us all
pick out our clothes.
You look beautiful, Mom.
Give her a hand!
Can l have your blouse?
This is a private dinner.
We're on the list.
You're gonna have to leave.
They're sort of with me.
You said
we could get new clothes!
Do you know these people?
l didn't know.
l thought someone
could help them.
lt's OK.
Everything's different
in New York, right?
l shouldn't even be in New York.
l'm a Baltimore girl,
and that's where l should stay.
And most importantly,
to my girlfriend Shelley.
To Shelley, the real reason
l take pictures at all.
To Shelley!
Honey, what does this mean?
""...Pecker's
delicious photographs...
""of his culturally
challenged family.""
'"Culturally challenged""?
l don't like the sound of that.
That's just art nonsense.
That's me in the paper.
Are you homosexual?
l'm not.
You wouldn't understand then.
Do you think this stuff is OK?
Sure.
This is a big article.
'"A stain goddess""?
The Village Voice called me
a stain goddess.
l just means you look good.
Hey, what are you doing later?
Maybe l'll be
in the Catholic Review.
You're gonna be a holy day
of obligation, Mom.
Here's the part l like.
'"Over 62 of Pecker's
edition prints...
""were sold for prices
as high as $1,300 each.""
They have that in the paper?
lt's our stop.
Oh, my God.
Mom, Dad.
What?
They've seen your pictures.
l'm out of here.
See you later.
Let's check it out.
Hold it, buddy.
Officer, it's our house.
Have we been robbed?
l'm afraid so.
But don't worry.
They're long gone.
Did they get my hot rollers?
l hear you're rich.
TV is gone.
So is the VCR.
l'll check upstairs.
How about the kitchen?
Nobody's hurt.
That's what's important.
See what happens
when you leave Baltimore?
Thank God Mary was with me.
Oh, God. My darkroom.
My Liza Minnelli CDs are gone!
They ate the cookies, too!
The negatives,
they're all here.
So are the prints.
They didn't even want my stuff.
They took the clock-radio
and your electric shaver.
l wonder if they were cute.
Sweetie,
did they take your cookies?
lt's no wonder we were robbed
with that Pelt Room nearby.
Pubic hair causes crime.
Full of grace.
lt's OK.
l hate vitamins!
lt's Rorey. ls Pecker there?
l have fabulous news.
Hold on.
Phone's for you!
We were just robbed.
What do you mean?
Burglarized?
lt's Rorey.
Take pictures.
This could be your next show.
Your mom's loss,
your dad's sadness.
Get close-ups.
l didn't even think
to take pictures.
Pictures?
Guess what?
The Whitney Museum wants to
schedule ""A Peek At Pecker""...
in their upcoming schedule.
The Whitney Museum !
Pecker's off work.
Call back during business hours.
This is all my fault.
What they call art in New York,
young man...
looks like plain misery to me.
Don't become an asshole.
l beg of you.
Don't become an asshole.
l don't understand this.
'"The haunting image
of financial despair.""
l was kidding around
with Pecker.
l've still got customers.
We still have food on the table.
Right?
Captain Crunch!
Don't!
My hair's a mess.
You look the same as always.
lt's awfully early, isn't it?
l got it.
Thank you.
Rorey--She's always in a hurry.
l was on MTV.
What?
l was talking to Larry
the Lughead on the phone...
and he saw Pecker's picture
of me on MTV.
Oh, Mary, l'm a model.
""Mary"" is not
a homosexual term.
Oh, my God! The cover!
Memama?
Oh, my God in heaven.
We're all famous.
Just like the Jackson family.
Don't say that.
l'm gonna show it to Monsignor.
l'd wait. l really would.
Some Catholics
might not understand it.
l'll get it.
Move over, Kate.
Outta my way, RuPaul.
See who it is first!
Her comes Tina, supermodel!
Ciao, ciao, ciao!
l'm Dr. Deborah Klompas.
l'm an M.D. with Baltimore
City Child Protection Services.
And you're Little Chrissy.
How may we help you?
lt's more about how l'm
gonna be able to help you.
We don't need anybody's help,
lady.
Protection Services
saw Little Chrissy...
in the Sun papers.
There's nothing wrong
with Little Chrissy.
Little Chrissy's wired.
She's just
a sugar-sensitive child.
That's all.
She does fidget.
l'll get it.
More good news.
Hold on. We're in the middle
of a family crisis.
l am sorry to inform you...
but your child has attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder.
She needs Ritalin.
This is important.

You have to hold on.
Greg Gorman is the photographer.
He shoots all the celebrities,
and he wants you to model.
l can't talk now.
l'll call you back.
She does climb excessively.
Would she eat better?
You think of these as Mother
and Daddy's little helpers.
Dad, all kids love candy,
though.
lt's for her health.
Go ahead and take
your medication.
Come on, Little Chrissy,
give me a pose.
What do you think you're doin'?
You remember me
from the thrift shop?
Wait a minute.
That's my dad's radio.
You robbed our house.
So? You took my photograph
and didn't pay me.
Come on, man.
That's not the same thing.
These are real-life shots.
Fuck you. lt's my life,
real or not, asshole.
We're even now.
Wait a minute!
My sister wants her CDs back!
No cops this time, right?
Don't worry about them.
They couldn't catch
a goddamn cold.
Your pictures are everywhere.
Tell me about it.
l'm trying to get new stuff,
but everyone knows me now.
l know. No doubt.
Here.
Don't even try it.
That's my private garbage.
Sorry. No hard feelings, l hope.
Get a real job.
You stole from charity.
l'm callin' Jerry Lewis.
l didn't sign no model release,
and l'm gonna sue your ass.
He didn't even get paid yet.
What would you know, fartmouth?
The gallery gets half his money.
You can suck my fat ass, Matt.
Do you think
l should move to New York?
Can l help you?
l think we're just looking.
Do you have any Guess jeans?
This ain't GQ, buddy.
We got real clothes
at regular prices.
Just trying to look my best.
How about Jordache?
l just told you.
Any Kathie Lee?
Sold out.
l'd like to fill out
a job application.
l knew it was you, stupid.
And you're Peckerhead, right?
Pecker, ma'am.
l saw those pictures, dumbbells!
You're both caught.
l was gonna put it back, honest.
We did it for the art.
Art-schmart.
Give me that camera.
Give me that camera,
or l'm callin' the cops.
OK, you two. Whip it out.
What?
l said take out your units.
Look, we're sorry.
l said unzip!
That's what l call
a Peckerprint.
Smile.
You're on Candid Camera.
l've never been caught
shoplifting in my life.
Maybe this will
teach you both...
that some people
don't feel like being art.
lf l can't steal,
l don't want to be famous.
l quit.
We're sorry. Matt's a thief,
but he's a nice person.
ls this the stain goddess
l heard about on Howard Stern?
How do l get rid
of Pecker-tracks?
Eat one, asswipe.
Be a good little girl and put
your vagina to the phone.
Shove it, fuckwad.
Stop taking my picture!
You're ruining my life!
l'm sorry. l thought
l was making your life better.
Want to take my picture?
You can't do that in here.
Go to New York.
They love that stuff.
Take my picture. Please?
Don't you dare.
Come on!
Before my quarters run out!
Spin n' Grin.
lt's me.
l sold three prints
of you today.
ls Pecker there?
Another obscene call.
lt's your girlfriend, asshole.
Can l work in peace?
Hi, honey. lt's me, Rorey.
Did you get my little present?
lf this is Pecker,
don't call back.
Spin n' Grin.
lt's me, Peck.
A dryer overheated,
and some idiot flashed me.
Call Rorey.
Maybe she feels like talking.
Could you get that door?
Are you sure this outfit is...
the way it's supposed to be?
-Looks great.
-Turn this way.
Let's see the Polaroid.
Stop mauling me! Get off!
Background ready?
Five minutes.
Hold still.
l'd never wear this ugly rag.
lt's comme des garçons, darling.
You should be so lucky.
Close your eyes.
Don't tell me about fashion.
Mr. Gorman, l'm not so sure...
Pecker is so comfortable
about modeling today.
But your son's
a fashion natural.
He's going to look great.
Can l see?
Shake your head, darling.
l look like a simpleton.
You with the rash, put this on.
My scalp itches.
Look at Mommy.
Honey, look at Mommy.
What? Oh, sweetie, is it time
for your medication?
Here we go.
l don't know about these pills.
Here. There you go, sweetie.
Wash it down.
You don't want any soda?
l wouldn't wear this
to the shelter, you twit!
Don't fight me, darling.
You can wear this anywhere.
You trying to blind me?
Jesus, what the hell
have you done to my mother?
l look silly, don't l?
What a beauty.
l'm not a beauty.
l'm a photographer.
Please, l'm more comfortable
on the other side of the camera.
You know what?
l don't want to be in Vogue.
Everybody wants to be in Vogue.
Background action.
Miss Betty, Al,
you don't have to do this.
Are they getting paid?
Nobody went over this with me.
Wait. l said no.
Don't we get food?
Did anyone hear me?
We're not doing this.
Get the hell off me.
Al, Miss Betty, stop it!
You don't have to model
if you don't want to.
He's poor...he's white...
but he sure ain't trash.
God! l don't want to be a model.
Oh, my God.
What's the matter?
She's choking to death!
Take a sip.
Spit it out.
Good. Great.
Somebody please call the doctor!
This is great. Good.
-Stop taking my picture!
-A little over there. Good.
Spit it up.
There, it's all better.
Got your shot?
l guess we can retouch.
The Lord is with me.
l know.
Full of grace.
You sure are.
You're a virgin, a mother,
and you're all mine.
Who is it?
We're the Friends of Mary,
and we've come to see Our Lady.
Be right down.
lt's all right. Be right back.
-They can't do this.
-Look at that baby.
Goddamn it! Pig!
Long live bush!
Cover it up.
Get off me, motherfucker!
Shave it off!
Pubic hair harassment!
Beaver brutality!
Pubic hair is against the law.
We want bush!
l'll make the money
off my Pelt, not you!
T-Bone! l didn't want anybody
arrested for my pictures.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Can't you see what pubic hair
is doing to this neighborhood?
Sinking your property values!
Get off! l didn't do anything.
These nice ladies
have come to honor you.
Full of grace.
You're saying that yourself.
What do you mean?
You heard me, faker.
l need Mary's help.
Oh, you have company.
This is my grandson Pecker.
These are the Friends of Mary...
or so they say.
They're not being nice to her.
We can see her lips moving.
lt's just a matter of faith,
ladies.
Here. Come on.
Shut your eyes
and think of the color blue.
No, you don't. Heretic!
Maryolatry is not a joke.
Full of grace.
This is too much
for my Catholic ears...
and l'm telling Monsignor.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women...
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
You can tell the pope
for all l care!
My grandmother's a saint!
Ask Mary to make my life
like it used to be.
l'll try.
Pecker has a request.
Come in, Mary.
lt's me, Memama.
lt's me, and l'm talking to you.
Mary was silent
for centuries, right?
l guess you can't expect her
to talk on demand.
Talk, goddamn it!
lt's your pictures.
See what they've done?
They've ruined my miracle.
Come on!
Right here, waiting.
Come on.
This is a gay establishment.
We know.
We're here for the teabagging.
What teabagging?
We saw Pecker's pictures.
They're hilarious.
Give me that.
Listen up!
There's no teabagging here...
and there's no straight people
allowed, either.
What?
Come on, all of youse.
l need to see some gay l.D.,
or you're out of here.
Take the money.
Who will be
Mr. Rough Trade Baltimore?
Get away.
Did you hear me?
Will it be Death Row Dave?
Dave's a three-time loser.
He's sentenced to the chair,
but he's still got a boner!
His last request--
one more hum job before
they pull the switch.
Here he comes.
He's Matt the Thief.
He's barely legal,
but he's got the beef.
The kindest face
you'll ever find...
but if you own a store,
he'll shoplift you blind.
You ruined my career.
l'm sorry.
-Billy Heckman!
-Dad?
You are queer!
No, Mom, l'm trade.
The queers blow me.
l don't blow them.
l'm still straight.
You get off that bar
and cover yourself!
Come here.
Watch your beer, sir.
Come on.
We're getting out of here.
Tina, you're fired.
Oh, God, no, Mr. Nellbox.
This is all my fault.
Don't blame Tina.
Please.
Trade is my life.
Because of your pictures...
look what you did
to your sister.
Washing Machine Pervert, right?
Fabulous.
l sold this one to L'uomo Vogue.
Good.
This one--Don't you think
it would be perfect...
for that special edition...
Parkett magazine
wants you to do?
Sure.
We got to talk.
These pictures...
they're just suddenly all shit.
Nonsense.
Your work just evolved.
Congratulations.
What's this?
We're doing great.
And for your Whitney show...
it will be a triumph of pain.
That's a terrible poster.
l want to like it. l just don't.
Shelley's out of context.
She's not like this.
How can you be
so kind and gentle...
and still have talent?
l just try to do good work.
Could we be together just once?
You mean...
For the Whitney?
But you're my art dealer.
That's right. l am...
and l also understand
your vision.
Just once--
for art.
Oh, my God!
lt's not what you think!
lt's all about the work!
l hate modern photography!
l'm sorry. l didn't mean
for this to happen.
You're not supposed
to have sex with people...
you're trying to help.
l didn't plan it.
l like Shelley.
She's a sweetheart.
l just wanted a real boyfriend,
not some art person.
Cancel the Whitney.
You can't do that.
l want my friends, family,
and career back!
Let's talk.
Don't leave.
We can work this out.
What about New York?
They can come to me.
l'm going to have my own show
here in Baltimore.
But the Whitney!
What am l supposed
to tell the Whitney?
Shelley, l love you!
l love you more than Kodak!
Wait!
Help, police! He took a dump
without buying anything!
Get off me.
Police!
l'm making a citizen's arrest!
Matt, l got paid.
l'll give you a job,
and this time, you're on salary.
All right, Pecker-man.
You're the boss.
Bastards!
Voting card, please.
You can take the second booth
on your right.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Your voting cards, please?
l don't have it with me,
but l'm registered.
My name is Pecker.
Excuse me.
Do you have a bathroom?
This is a polling place,
not a filling station.
Excuse me.
Voting booths
are private places, Mr. Pecker.
lf l were you,
l would concentrate...
on my own personal choice
of candidate...
and not the choices of others.
l really have to use
the bathroom.
One would think
a serious voter...
would eliminate
before leaving home.
But it's an emergency.
All right. Here.
Thanks.
lt's through that door
and to the left.
To the left!
Mr. Pecker?
l'll be right back.
l'm trying to vote.
Come on.
Mr. Pecker, did you hear me?
Oh, God.
Let me stand in your bag.
She can't see me now.
Attention, voters.
No two people are allowed
in a voting booth.
More than one person
inside a voting booth...
is a federal offense...
punishable...
by up to three years in prison.
Please come back.
Without you, my work is shit.
Rorey's your work.
lt's you that l love.
l don't understand
that art crap.
You could
if you just opened your eyes.
l work in a Laundromat.
Art's everywhere.
ln my endless bags
of dirty laundry.
lt is, if you think about it.
What?
The brilliant green
of a grass stain?
That's art.
The subtle yellow
of a urine-soaked sheet?
Keep going.
lt's what you see every day.
The aqua blue of cold water...
as it dilutes a violent
red blood stain?
You got it.
Be spontaneous
for once in your life.
l'm scared.
The almond brown of a stubborn
mildew stain can be beautiful?
Let your mind go,
and you'll be free forever.
l think l finally see it.
Art.
Use a condom.
Settle down, folks.
l know we're all excited.
Take it away.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to Pecker's Place.
We're here with Pecker's
grandmother Memama.
Tell us, why won't Mary talk?
She went up, that's all.
Mary's broke.
But if channel 45's viewers
pray hard enough...
maybe Our Lady will speak again.
l'm Sloane Brown,
Channel 45 News...
live at Pecker's Place.
What's going on?
How you doing?
You're going through.
l know you.
Look.
Friends of the Whitney...
this is Baltimore.
Wonderful. Let's get off.
Look...
a row house.
With white marble steps.
lt's just like his pictures.
lt's so dignified.
So powerful.
lt's almost sexual, isn't it?
You with the goiter in the back.
How you doing? You.
Excuse me, l'm Jed Coleman.
This is the Whitney group.
lt's four dollars
for each of you.
l didn't know
there was a cover charge.
l thought you liked it
when l stole.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
lt's not just me.
lt's my friends, my family.
Everyone here inspires me.
Pecker sees New York
from the outside looking in...
and if you just open your eyes,
you'll see it, too.
l see what you mean.
That skinny lady in the photo--
That's fucking hilarious.
l love it.
We're open for business.
What do you got to trade?
l do own a bakery.
How about complimentary
birthday cakes...
for each member of your family
for two years?
lt's a deal.
l'm putting it
in my rumpus room.
Mr. Coleman,
so glad you could make it.
How does it feel to be
in front of the camera?
Well, it...
takes a little getting used to.
Hi, Mary! Welcome to Baltimore.
l didn't know Pecker
was showing this work.
Pecker, darling.
l want to see lowlife.
Show me down and dirty.
lt's just us, Lynn.
You remember Shelley, right?
Congratulations.
Oh, my God.
You look daringly original.
There's not a catalog, is there?
Nice tits, ma'am.
lt's the liquor lady.
Want to dance?
l only had two drinks
that night.
Think l care?
l drink, too.
Set 'em up.
There you go.
Oh, Miss Betty,
that looks wonderful.
l don't know.
Will it wrinkle
if l sleep in it?
Not that fabric.
That's flameproof, too...
in case someone
sets you on fire.
All right. l'll take it.
Good.
lsn't fashion something?
Here comes the vegan.
Chrissy's a good little girl.
She looks so different.
Little Chrissy's off the drugs.
She's sugar-free and on the road
to a balanced diet.
Thank you, honey.
Come on, gorgeous, be honest.
When was the last time...
a straight guy
asked you to dance?
Go on, Venetia.
Get it, girl.
Go on. You're in Baltimore.
Congratulations, Pecker.
Shelley.
Thank you.
l'm glad you could come.
This is my new discovery Randy.
He's from New Jersey and is
the first blind photographer.
l feel portraits,
and l smell landscapes.
l'm giving him a show
in November.
ls that outsider art?
No more light readings.
No more focusing.
Maybe you should give him
a show in your Laundromat.
Send me some slides.
l'll do that.
Go, T-Bone!
All right, T-Bone!
No pubic hair!
No vagrants!
Take your pants off.
Teabag him, Larry.
Brilliant work.
Thanks, Mr. Hallbrook.
Shake it, sweetheart!
Ride it, bitch!
Ride it like a butch bottom !
New York was never like this!
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
She's talking,
and l'm not saying anything.
Full of grace--
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Our prayers have been answered.
Full of grace.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Grace. Holy.
Grace. God.
Holy.
Do you think
it's a real miracle?
Quiet, please.
Quiet, everybody.
Come on in. Gather around.
Pecker, get up here.
l have a toast.
To Pecker.
To Pecker!
And the end of irony!
What's next?
Well...
l think...
You know what?
l'm thinking
of directing a movie.
