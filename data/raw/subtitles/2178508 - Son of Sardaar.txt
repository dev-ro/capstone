Sometimes i have a question in my mind
if sardar won't be exist in the world
then what would happen?
Sorry dude but world is useless
without son of sardar.
It's fire
you should set in your chest
not on your lips
and you are smoking cigarette
being a sardar

Did you forget what legendry
jasvinder singh said...
if you won't smoke you will never ill
first you save the money and second
you can make your body
who is this legendry jasvinder
singh randhava?
That legend is standing next to you
if yourtongue is not good but
you should speak good things
go home your mom must
be waiting foryou
if god gave you the mouth so
why you are speaking with hands
you didn't go yet
why are you getting angry?
Sometimes have smile.
Don't make fun of sardar and don't
assume him ajoker
because if you will raise your hand
to sardar's head
then sardar will send you higher
you adopted him
now who will adopt you
take anything
but never mess with pathan's friend
otherwise pathan will...
anybody left?
I am left here
if you will spare something then
we will use it
you have ruined my entire club
you have been here from six months
and you have got 14 fights and
4 police cases

requesting you
we are requesting you in
english that look

Look london is not made foryou
so please get a ticket for india
otherwise we will go to haji ali
swear on your life

pathan will sacrify his life for him
i will kill that man who will
try to send him from here
you stay on the side never interfere
while elders are speaking.
Here is your courier
you have been called to india
i won't go back to india
everybody will call me hindustan lever.
Why?
Who left india people call him
hindustan lever
it means they will also call
me hindustan lever
stay on the side
it's a government notice
i have a land in paghwarah
government wants to buy for 5 million
but i don't have any property
in paghwarah.
It's yourfamily land,
my mom nevertold me about that
your mom didn't tell you
many things
it's an old story
yourfamily had an emity with
sandhu family for small reason
they fought like cats and dogs
generation got over but their
enmity never get over
and from this enimty even your dad
couldn't survive
he killed mahindar singh sandhu
and sandhu killed your dad,
jassi my son!
Take revenge of my death
i have shot all the bullets in
his chest
nobody's in gandhara's house
his deadbody is lying there
his wife escaped with his son
what we do now we have guests here
shall we welcome them orfinish
this marriage first?
No marriage will take place
take swear of yourfather
until you both won't take revenge
of yourfather's death
you won't eat ice cream
and you won't drink cold drink
and until i don't take revenge
of my uncle's death
i won't get married.
And that's why your mom took you
along and wandered everywhere
so sandhu couldn't find you
and she nevertold him that story
do you know why?
She wanted that this enmity shall over
listen son!
I have called your mom my sister
i won't let you go to india
they will kill you
we three will adjust here
but i won't let you go.
His dad left 5 million for him
those sons are lucky who got
father like his dad

i will come with you,
pathan and sardar will deal
with everyone
no friend you already owe me alot
and it's been 25 years they must have
forgotten after all they are humans
i will be back after selling
my property
i don't think that sandhu must
be waiting for me
priest!
Whenever some priest tried to
attend my wife's marriage
you have attended his funeral
you are such an expensive priest

in this village

his childhood photo
that must be small photo
what's the big deal?

lion comes from his mood and right
now lion is not in mood
lion is feeling sleepy
and lion is going to sleep.
Where did he go?
Tell me one thing which one is cheap

titto!
Yes!
Double up the men
that sardar shouldn't escape
between the guests

i always keep smiling
i left my house
that's why i have become emotional.
Really?
I can't live without my family
liar!
Really!
I wanted to talk to you
i know everything
you knew it?
How?
I can see everything
you think i am a fool
i have known when you were
prentending that you are injured
so you can't tell me earlier
i am wandering scared here
you can also tell me earlier
you would have tell me in train

you will pacify him if i will survive
keep smiling
you looks good when you smile
take care!
You are here fortaking care of me
you are much intelligent,

We both are sardar and others
are useless
sardar is falling in love
do you know?
Sardar becomes dangerous when
he felt in love
come here you intelligent sardar
how do you know?
First sardarfelt in love
then his heart broke down
then sardar starts drinking
and you know that drunk sardar
is very dangerous
i know...
because we both are sardars and
others are useless
you are speaking like sardars.
So your sardar becomes your headache
he is sardar he won't tell
me everything
their marriage is fixed

Have you ever seen the fate?
Look at her!
She is amazing!
Whoever have it he would
win the world
and you are making her cry,
don't cry!
You are not my fate that you are crying
you are his fate,
look you are not sunny deol
that entire panjab will take their
daughters afteryou
you have got it,
so deserve it.
I have known in 2 days but
you didn't know
that if you will find the entire world
you will neverfind a girl like her
somebody shall give his life for her
it's heart

My uncle died in these hands
and he told me only one thing
before death
revenge of enmity

the house
you will also have to come outside
the house
then i will see who will protect you
jasvinder singh
you are dead!
I didn't live properly
you guys won't go
we will go.
But first we will kill you
don't makejoke with sardar and
don't assume himjoker
because if you will raise your hands
to sardar's head
then sardar will send you higher
i wanted to talk to you
that you don't want to marry me
i also don't want to marry you
i know that you love jassi.
When you knew that i love jassi
so why did you agreed for marriage
to save jassi's life
jassi is the same person
whom sandhu family is looking
for 25 years
to take yourfather's death revenge
i have seen his property papers
in his bag
what are transferred on harjeet's name
jassi's name is jasvinder singh
you love her...
when i found out so how could
i let him die
we created your marriage drama
so he could escape between the guests
but that sardar came behind you
his life is in danger
they will kill him
don't worry he is enough for
many people
before he is gone you go...
i will handle billu jee...
and your marriage?
Don't worry about me
you go...
bobby! Why don't you say something
look! If your headache will go then
you will give me headache...

Won't you say all the best to me.
Stop!
We don't kill the guest in the house
we have taken him out very hardly
you brought him back inside
so shall we go out again
you have come!
Where you have been?
We were waiting foryou
in gurudhwara
what happened to you?
Why both are wet?
Look at him carefully!
He is randhava's son
for whom we were waiting from
25 years
he is our enemy
enemy!
We don't have enmity with anyone
which enmity you are talking about?
We don't have enmity with anyone
you are very dramatic
you know very well.
That he is the son of that randhava
who killed your son
today you are not changed
with monto's bike
you remember everything
you are pretending like you don't
remember anything
which memories hert you...
it's betterto forget them
you also forget that
for sukh's sake...
you have spend 25 years in
enemy's rage
your own were dying foryour love
but you share any moment
of love with them
i will forgive you on one condition
that you will become a permanent
guest of this house
if i will go out so you won't
kill me
if you will leave sukh
then i will kill you
smile sometimes...
i have decided our kids names
one kid's name will be happy and
second kid's name will be ending
