Call down to the yard.
Tell them to notify me.
Call them on the radio!
Cosita linda, linda. Despierta, perra.
¿ Y tú, qué, cómo anda?
¿ Tocando el piano? ¡Qué rica, mami!
Dame la maleta. Voy al aeropuerto.
Read this, puta.
Thanks.
Want a date, honey?
Money, money, money.
Check this out.
You wanna stop?
No.

# Cheeba cheeba, y'all
# Let me tell you a little tale
about Peter the Pimp
# Sucka MC'ed, tryin' to cop a limp
# Rode around town in a couple of cars
# Got gagged by the man
tryin' to stick up a bar
# The judge said,
"Boy, what was on your mind?"
# He said, "I had some cheeba cheeba,
cocaine and some wine"

Yo, Tubes, my boy, what's up?
- What?
- What's taking so long, man?!
This'll take a few minutes.
We ain't got a few minutes, man!
We got to get busy!
Do me a favour, all right? Here.
Calm down, all right? Relax.
Yo, let me show you how to test this.
Hecho in Paraguay.
Ciento por ciento puro.
Right. It's dope! It's dope, Tito!
Yo, man, you ever get the feeling
you was being watched? Damn!
You got any soda, man?
Like some root beer or something?
I hurt my leg playing ball and I got
these aspirins to take, you know?
Man, what the fuck is he...?
Turn this shit off. What kinda help
you got? Watching cartoons?!
Tell him to turn the TV off and get me
a soda. Una Coca-Cola, por favor.
Baja y búscale una Coca-Cola.
Yeah, and make sure it's cold.
I like my shit cold when I'm playing ball.
You play ball?
You don't look like you do,
but yo, nice gloves.
- Hey, Jump.
- What's up?
- It's copacetic.
- Now maybe you satisfied.
Maybe now I wanna check out
another one. I'm no Joe Neckbone.
- Trust ain't one of my stronger qualities.
- I guarantee this shit!
To hell with testing.
Let's get to the large plus 10 per cent.
Did he say 10 per cent?
Tito, man, we had a deal! What's up?!
What 10 per cent you talking about?
Transportation costs, amigo.
I got expenses.
Well, take the train!
Why you wanna be greedy, Tito!
That's our price. No-one else even talks to
you goddamn coños! Take it or leave it.
Why you wanna talk to me like that, man?
Take it or leave it...?
Take it or leave it?
I'll take it.
Cos I like you, I'm gonna take it.
Pack this shit up.
El verde, negrito.
You in power, Tito. You in power.
You the king, Tito.
Where's my soda?
Apresúrate con la Coca!
What the fuck is this?!
They're for the bullet holes, puta!
Room service, motherfuckers!
There's somebody here to see you.
What's in the cup?
Root beer.
You want some?
There's some things I don't do.
Bop bop bop!
Wo-o-o-oh!
Pah!
What's happenin'? Hey, look at you!
Welcome back home, Frank!
- All right!
- Yo, congratulations, Frank!
Congratulations, man.
The Colombian motherfuckers...
...took permanent vacation in hell,
if you know what I mean.
Well, I must have been away
too long because...
...my feelings are dead.
I, uh... I feel no remorse.
It's a terrible thing.
I heard jail makes
you feel like that, man.
I got a present for you.
They were King Tito's.
But he don't need them where he is now.
I thought maybe you would donate 'em
to a clothing drive or somethin'.
That's great, man.
Having a good time, huh, Jump?
Hey, man, I've been waiting years for this.
Emilio Zapa... sends his regards!
Ah! Ah!
You know how I love money.
Well, help yourself.
Is the meeting set with Dalesio?
Downtown.
You need to let me bust a cap
in that motherfucker's ass.
Word!
He's a fuckin' glitter boy, looking to get
sprayed, laid, played and slayed!
I heard that!
So...
...are you gonna come down, say hello?
You can hobnob with them homos
if you want to.
I'm going downtown, find me a girl,
get my knob polished.
Time for a real party!
Jim...
...how come you never came to see me?
Who wanted to see you in a cage, man?
Of course.
- Later!
- Later!
Champagne. Let's break out.
Yes. Yes.
It's King Tito's.
King Tito's glove!
It's a good thing he's dead,
cos I'd wrap that glove right round...
Sex.
And it's how much?
Well, wait for the paperback.
It's too fuckin' much for me!
- You should read it.
- Why?
- Because you might learn something.
- What? How to be good?
Joey, just don't say a word, OK?
I don't want you to say anything.
- We're going home, right?
- I know. I'm tired. Where is he?
Welcome home, Frank.
- Hi.
- Good to see you.
Nice to see you.
Thanks for everything.
To freedom.
Come on.
Earl, nice to see you.
- Earl, Charlie, you know Frank.
- How are you?
Judge, how are you?
I want to introduce you to...
- I wanna say hello to your junior partner.
- OK. Fine.
Be more careful of the affairs
you attend, Counsellor.
One is known by the company one keeps.
Right, Joey?
- Pete, how are you?
- Hey, Frank. Welcome home.
Hello, Frank.
Welcome back.
You know everybody here, I think.
Pete, how's the family? Brian? Dennis?
Better than when you left town.
They're all working. And you?
Back from the dead.
Frank White, I've heard a lot about you.
And it's all bad.
Don't believe everything
Pete writes in the columns...
...because, well...
Anyway, I've been reformed.
A lot of people will be happy
to hear that. Huh, Pete?
What can we expect from
the reformed Frank White?
I wanna be Mayor.
Thinks I'm kidding.
First...
...I wanna talk to Arty Clay.
Relax, we're supposed
to be having a good time here.
I wanna talk things over with him.
He's a fuckin' animal.
He won't meet with you.
Maybe I can get one of his lieutenants.
Tell him... Frank White wants
to talk business with him.
Just tell him that... all I wanna know
is where and when.
Counsellor, they did a wonderful job
with this gentleman.
He's better than ever.
If you'll excuse me.
I'll see you people in a little while,
if I'm still around.
Look at you!
Look at you.
What's the matter?
Are you not glad to see me?
You belonged where they put you.
Maybe this time you'll stay out of trouble.
That depends on
how good my lawyers are.
I thought people like you didn't
believe in the legal process.
I thought people like me
were the legal process.
You know what? Uh...
You know what I'd like to do... to you?
I would like...
...to take you on the subway.
What can I do for you?
Tell Arty I need to speak to him.
- Wait here.
- Sure.
There's some yarm out there
that wants to talk to you.
Ace is still the better.
- Arty, you're...
- What's happening here?
200.
I'll put 200.
I gotta see you, too.
All right, one shot. Last ticket.
Johnny, give me something good.
Arty. Gentlemen.
- Chi è chisto?
- Nun sacc'io.
- Who goes?
- Arty.
All right. I bet 200. Go ahead.
I got a message from Frank White.
He wants to sit down, he wants to talk.
Tell him I don't talk to nigger lovers.
All right, what's down?
He says he's got things to discuss with
you. He wants to know where and when.
Tell him in fuckin' hell, that's where!
He's gonna wish his lawyer left him
fuckin' the sambos in the joint!
I was making a lot of money
off them Colombians.
That's right.
If that's what you want me
to tell him, I'll tell him.
Why, it ain't clear enough?
Tell that son of a bitch
he made a big mistake with me.
And tell him something else.
This is what Arty Clay has to say!
Shit, man!
You tell him personally, from me.
Stay outta here!
Come on, sit down. Let's go.
I missed you.
Your watch and your wallet, blood.
Whoa!
How about that?
Come by the Plaza Hotel.
I got work for you.
Ask for Frank White.
It's up to me, right?
You guys are in trouble. I bet 200.
OK. Hurry up, will ya?
I'm down a lot of money here.
Let's play cards.
I got your message, Arty.
You stupid son of a bitch.
You running games here? I wanna play.
Sure, Frank, play. Bring your friends.
Nah. I wanna play with Arty.
Let's go, will ya?
Jump deals.
Blackjack, house out.
Hey!
You got some balls, coming here.
Pick up the card.
Pick up the card.
Pick it up.
OK.
From here on,
nothing goes down unless I'm involved.
No blackjack, no dope deals, no nothing.
A nickel bag gets sold
in the park, I want in.
You guys got fat while
everybody starved on the street.
It's my turn.
You think you're gonna live long enough
to spend that money, you fuckin' hump?
If any of you...
...are tired of getting
ripped off by guys like that...
...you come with me.
I'm at the Plaza Hotel.
You're welcome. You're all welcome!
Enjoy!
Man or ghost, I'll kill you again!
Ed.
Ed!
Aisha, how you been?
I'm very upset about
what happened today.
Frank, I did the best that I could,
and you know that.
- Edward... how are you?
- Hello, counsellor! How are you?
- Alicia, how are you?
- Aisha.
The city councilman
was explaining to me...
...why that hospital in the South Bronx
didn't survive the fiscal cut today.
I'm telling him how disappointed I am.
I was explaining that there simply
wasn't money in the budget.
In a city of 12 million,
I find that hard to believe.
I'd hoped we could do better.
I'd hoped so, too, Frank,
but there simply was no money.
If you think it's so easy,
try funding it yourself.
- Maybe I will.
- OK.
How about 16 million
by the end of the quarter?
Tell your friends they'll have the money.
Counsellor,
you're this man's legal advisor.
Explain to him the hard financial facts
of running a municipality.
I know what this city needs.
Privileged districts shouldn't be
the only ones with hospitals!
- Forget it, Frank.
- I want that place kept open.
The city can't afford it. Neither can you.
The city doesn't know
where to get the money.
Let me give you some expensive advice:
Go where you can stay out of trouble.
That's what I pay you for.
- Hello, Frank. I wanna talk to you.
- I don't think so.
Come on!
O'Neill can wait for two old friends.
- I'm not your friend.
- Come on, Frank. We missed you.
- I thought about you, too.
- I heard a rumour about you.
What's that?
You got AIDS getting
dicked up your ass in prison.
I thought about you
every time I jerked off, dickhead.
- Why don't we take this outside?
- Next time, wear a tie.
- Get Abe.
- Here we go.
Excuse us, folks. Excuse us. Easy. Easy.
Excuse us. Excuse us. Easy. Easy.
Here we go.
- What the hell is this?
- Taking him in for questioning.
On what grounds? This is harassment.
You're welcome to come along.
Even your client's got a right to counsel.
Come on, get out!
- Look inside.
- Yeah, take a good look.
Let's go.
- What's that?
- You tell me.
- I don't know.
- This is your only chance.
- Are you arresting me?
- Fuck, here we go.
If not, I got people waiting for me.
Shut the fuck up, motherfucker!
Frank, I wanna tell you something. Come
here, Frank. Here, Frank. Meet somebody.
- What is this shit?
- All right, that's it! That's it!
I'm gonna cap the mother!
Get in the fuckin' car! Get in the car!
This how you do things?
I know what you're up to, White.
Forget it.
I'll make you and your friends
disappear long before that.
Welcome home, fuckface!
Gilley! Get in the fuckin' car!
Last fuckin' time, you fuck!
We're onto your fuckin' ass!
Give your friends that message.
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?
The best man has something to say.
I'd like to thank Tommy Flanigan for being
the only black male at an Irish wedding.
- Are you comfortable, Tom?
- Yeah, real comfortable.
- All my buddies are here. All my brothers.
- He's sweating! OK...
Uh, Joe... Joe Mulligan, father of the bride.
Joe provided these lovely decorations.
Where'd you get these, Joe?
An AA meeting?
And he paid for the whole thing!
The whole $200!
Joe, by the way, put your shotgun away.
The tests came back negative!
All right, all right.
Roy Bishop, do I detect a little Afro sheen
on that unusually wavy hair of yours?
Tip... Kathy... the finest couple I ever had
the pleasure to know. Join me, folks.
They're the only couple still together
in this neighbourhood!
I wish you health, wealth...
...happiness, a lot of babies, no cops.
We don't need no more degenerate
donkeys runnin' around with guns.
All bullshit aside, I think I speak for
everybody. We love you. God bless.
- Hear, hear!
- Here's to youse.
- How did I do?
- I'm proud of ya.
Hey, Father, thank you for coming.
Let's get Father laid. Come here!
Give me a real drink.
Would you get us a drink over here?
- Get the house a drink!
- Yeah!
The bar's not open now! You pay!
That's my wife!
It was a fuckin' joke! Will you relax?!
Virginia, come here. Come here.
Tip! Take a tip. Gilley's after your wife.
- Obvious, isn't it?
- It's more than obvious...
...by the vampire marks on her neck!
Get him outta here!
- What's what, my friend? How you doing?
- What's what? Terrific.
- How come you're not dancing?
- I'll leave that to the father of the bride.
Are you gonna make it through the night?
Are you kidding?
I'm the one that needs the honeymoon.
- All they do is stay in bed all fuckin' night!
- Do me a favour.
Give this to the kids.
I got a million things to do.
- You sure you won't come in?
- Nah, I'll see you during the week.
All right.
You take it easy, uh? Take care, Pops.
You can tell your boyfriend...
...to forget about it.
He ain't got enough money.
- Maybe he'll surprise you.
- I don't like his fuckin' surprises.
He's got a lot of nerve
even sending you here.
You could step all over that shit
and still get 120 a gram.
And I got 220 pounds of it.
Comes to 15 mill, street value.
And I want guarantees
nobody in this town can give.
Especially him.
Look, Larry,
why don't you set the terms?
I'll go back and I'll tell Frank.
If you two see eye to eye,
we make a deal.
If not, everybody goes
their own way, still friends.
- What do you say?
- That cocksucker ain't got no friends.
And before I sit across a table with him,
he gotta know one thing.
I ain't no fuckin' greaseball
named Arty Clay.
You got it.
And he pays for your cut.
Yeah.
Why don't you stick around?
I got Frankenstein coming on next.
Stop fuckin' with my lady...
I told him, stop fuckin' with my bitch.
And when he started crying like a bitch,
he got fucked like a bitch!
You hear what I'm saying?
We're gonna shoot the bitch!
Shoot the bitch!
Hey, what you want, man?
You want white meat, right?
No, dark meat!
Don't shoot me!
Can I help you?
You can give me 15 pieces
of chicken, motherfucker.
I want barbecue and I want crispy.
- You getting this all down?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want six pieces of corn,
and I want, uh...
Yeah, give me eight spare ribs.
And, uh... 12 pieces of shrimp.
Uh... some onion rings...
- You want tartar sauce or ketchup?
- Tartar sauce.
- You got potato salad?
- We ain't got no potato salad.
Look, get away from the games!
You ain't got no money! Just get away!
- What the fuck is the matter with you?
- Yo, is that it?
Yeah, that's it.
Make sure you get my food. Get it now.
And don't be drooling on it, man.
And I better not get none of that cat.
I want chicken.
Here. Y'all go play the games.
No offence, ma'am.
But you make sure
they get what they want, huh?
Go ahead, go ahead.
Y'all go play them games.
Play them games. Here, baby.
Here, go play the games. Go ahead.
Yo, what's happenin' with the food, man?
I ain't got all day.
- That'll be $56.70 total.
- Did I say I was finished?
Maybe I want birch beer.
You got birch beer?
We don't have no birch beer.
- You got root beer?
- We ain't got no root beer.
- How much is this?
- $56.90.
$56.90? Fuck you very much.
Hey, scumbag! Guess what?
You're under arrest.
Police!
It's all over, Jimmy.
You're under arrest for the murder
of Mata, Tito, and Santo Domingo.
You have the right to remain silent,
so shut the fuck up.
- Did you use this on Mata?
- Yeah. Same one I'm gonna use on you!
For the rest of your life,
you gonna be somebody's bitch!
Some motherfucker named Bubba!
- I'll slap the black off of your face!
- Take the cuffs off!
This is the happiest day of my life,
cos we got a real, live witness.
- I don't leave no witnesses!
- Oh, yeah? You must be gettin' old!
I'm gonna get you fuckin' guys!
I'm gonna fuck you up!
This is our nursery.
Without private assistance,
everything we've seen will close down.
I can't stress enough
how much your help could mean...
...to the families that depend on us
for medical care.
Please, just look around.
Look, Larry.
The most anybody is gonna give you
for your stuff is 30 grand a key.
That's about $3 million on a bulk sale.
So whoever buys it is gonna cut it, bag it,
sell it on the street, for 150 a gram.
That's $150,000 a key,
five times what they paid you.
So now your quintal's worth $15 million...
...a mark-up of 11 million something
that you get no part of.
I know you don't have the manpower
to peddle the uptown streets, but I do.
You put up the stuff,
I put up the guys to sell it.
I take the heat and the risk...
if there is any.
We divide the difference, setting aside
something for places like this.
What do you say?
If I was into socialised medicine...
...I would have stayed
in the Peking province.
I want cash for my goods.
- How much?
- Three million up front... like you said.
Plus another half a mill
when you unload it.
- That's a lot of money.
- Well, I got a lot of shit.
Make up your mind.
- Very well.
- You know something, Frank?
This conversation... made me realise
just how fuckin' crazy you really are.
Everything's all set up.
I don't think you should go alone.
I don't trust that fuckin' crazy Chinaman.
It's Enrico Mata. He's in a hospital
with a police guard around him 24 hours.
He's agreed to testify for them in court.
They got Jump cold this time.
It's murder one.
Did Abe get them to set bail?
- $1 million apiece.
- So go sign 'em on.
Posting that much will raise
more problems than it solves.
Get Abe to see if his friends can get
this cop transferred or retired.
I want him out of my way.
He's the chief investigating officer.
Don't even think about it.
Ask him...
...before I blow Bishop's brains
all over his fuckin' wing tips.
Get some guys and pick 'em up.
You got it, Frank.
Yo! Captain Crunch
and that Doughnut Crew is here!
Yo, fellas.
What's up? Long time, no see.
We having a party.
Bring the Chocolate Wonder.
Your mother's coming.
We having a real good time.
Gimme some!
Black man!
Here, get some flowers for your witness.
Jimmy, we got business to do.
Get some cheap ones.
And you can kiss my ass, too!
- See you downtown.
- OK, yeah.
What?
Proud of yourself, Counsellor?
You know, if you got a problem,
take it to the judge.
Get him! Get him!
Where's the stuff, Larry?
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
...Mr Freddie Jackson.
# All my life
# I've been waiting
# For a time when I'd be free
# How I prayed
# For liberation
# And a little bit of dignity
# I heard the heartbeat of the city
# How it pounded
and it sounded in the night
# The children's voices were so pretty
# I'm gonna reach out,
I'm gonna take it
# I'm gonna make it all right
# Dream on
# For a better day
# When we can live our lives
and our hopes won't fade away
# Dream on
# For a better way
# We'll join our hands together
# And build a brand-new day
# Dream on
Thank you. Thank you.
You are all so tremendous.
I was born in this neighbourhood
and, as I grew up, I used to pray...
...that, once I got out, I would never
have a reason to come back.
I'm glad those prayers
weren't answered...
...because my neighbourhood's
looking mighty pretty lately.
And I've been encouraged,
both in public and in private...
...that, where there's a will to help,
there's a way to do it.
So on behalf of the council,
myself, and New York City...
...I thank you for what you've done.
And I ask for your continued support...
...until we have the kind of general hospital
this borough needs.
# I'm gonna reach up,
I'm gonna take it
# I'm gonna make it all right
# Dream on
# For all that could be right
# We can make it happen
# We can make it better
# Just dream on
# For a better way
# We'll join our hands together
# And build a brand-new day
# Dream on
We're reporting live
from the Harlem Ballroom...
...where city luminaries are celebrating
the project to rebuild the general hospital.
One local politician said, "It's a proud
moment for the city and all New Yorkers."
Roy... He's a movie star!
Frank is a fuckin' movie star now.
Oh, my God. Help me, gentlemen.
Help me.
A toast.
A toast.
Come on! Toast! Frank! He made it!
- All right?
- Fuckin' King of New York.
- The King... of New York.
- King!
We, on the other hand, waste our time
interrogating witnesses...
...liftin' fingerprints -
my favourite, and yours -
...court orders - right, Roy? -
...so Frank's Park Avenue attorney...
can get him out in ten minutes.
Ten minutes later... he's on the street.
I thought we were what's right.
I thought the law counted for somethin'.
But this whole system...
...favours the scumbag.
We make - what? - $36,000 a year?
- $36,500.
- $36,500. Thank you.
I was the best man at your wedding.
Thank you very much.
$36,500 to risk our lives
every night of the week...
...and Frank gets rich on killing people.
Roy...
Roy...
...there's only one way to get Frank.
We can make it look like a rival gang,
if that makes you feel any better.
Are you gonna shoot everybody
you can't arrest, Dennis?
That's not your fuckin'...
You know what my problem is with you?
I can't do my job.
My job is to protect the people of this city,
and you won't let me.
You do anything stupid,
I'm coming after your ass.
With or without you...
...l'm gonna get rid of Frank.
OK? So now you know.
This guy belongs in a fuckin'
rubber gun squad. He's a nut.
You know, Roy...
...every time Frank
kills somebody out there...
...it's our fault.
Can you live with that?
I can't.
# "Saturday Night" by Schoolly D
# It was Saturday night
and I'm feelin' kinda sporty
# Went to the bar, caught me a forty
# Got kinda high and-a kinda drunk
# So I kicked the ass of this little punk
# Forgot my key, I had to ring my bell
# My momma came dressed,
she said "Who the hell?"
# "Wait, Momma, wait,
it's me, your little son"
# Before I knew it, my mom pulled a gun
# "I know who y'are,
but who the hell is that?"
# I turned around, man, this bitch was fat
# I really don't know,
she got into the car
# I musta picked her up
when I left the bar
# Y'know I'm horny-homey man,
I wanted to chill
# But you know how mothers are,
she wanted to ill
# So I said,
"Hey, baby, is you on the pill?"
# "Cos tonight I wanna be your lover"
# "Just one thing. ;
I forgot to buy a rubber"
# Wait a little while,
then we snuck upstairs...
It's something that you've
looked at all your life.
It crosses your mind that
you'll never see it again.
I've lost a lot of time.
It's gone.
From here on I can't waste any.
If I can have a year or two,
I'll make something good.
I'll do something.
Something good.
Just one year. That's all.
I want to get into a series of instruments...
...with respect to buying
the dollar against the yen...
...not against the Deutschmark,
the Swiss Bank, or any other currency.
Salvador Tito,
Miguel Mata, Emilio el Zapa...
...Arthur Clay, Lawrence Wong.
Take a good look.
You represent the man responsible.
Are you out of your mind?
You're a lawyer.
How can you be part of this?
- Part of what?
- Don't pretend you don't know.
I don't pretend.
You got evidence? Prosecute.
By then it'll be too late.
Bring him in.
We're gonna go see Frank, all right?
# I'm Black! Too damn powerful
# I'm still a bad boy, get an eyeful
# And if you're tired of the other MC's
# Well, come on in
and get a listen from me
# Because the rhymes, 14 carat
# You suckers, you wanna grab it
# But you run like a little bitty rabbit
# Pullin' my cape is a very bad habit
# Cocaine - you still smoke it
# Homey dude, you must be jokin'
# My fat chain, I am chokin'
# All through the school,
you should be votin'
# On the MIC, I'm like a pit bull
# My brain, my brain is so full
of words, verbs, adjectives, pronouns
# Come on in and sit on down
# Just listen to what you been missin'
# On the floor, your eyes will glisten
# I see you wishin' on the wishbone
# My name's Schoolly School,
I'm never alone
# Just rough and tough,
and takin' no stuff
# All I really wanna know, y'all,
# Am I Black enough?
# Am I Black enough for ya?
# I'm Black!
Yo, Joey D, what's up, my boy?
You ain't gonna introduce me
to your friends?
I wanna make a good impression on 'em.
- I wanna know who I'm selling drugs to.
- You don't sell drugs - you shoot people.
Yo, I'm unemployed, man!
Ain't nobody left!
I can't help you with that.
# Am I Black enough for ya, America?
# I don't need no ice
# All I need is my blackness
# Some others seem to lack this
# Black joy and my Black vibe
# Gonna be a Black man
till the day I die
# Just rough and tough
and takin' the stuff
# All I really wanna know, y'all,
# Am I Black enough?
Yo, yo, yo, yo! Wake up, wake up!
Frank...
- This is, uh... XL Carter.
- How you doin'?
- How's Los Angeles?
- Hot.
You want me to get you
something to drink?
No. If you don't mind,
I wanna get right down to it.
You got a lot of shit to move, and Joey
thinks I might be interested in pursuing it.
Taste it.
Shit!
Price tag's 12 million... cash.
I can get you six...
...and I'll give you another six
after I recoup from street sales.
- For half the cash, you get half the drugs.
- It's all or nothing, man.
I'll leave Carlos here to walk through
the rest of the shit, and I'll be back later.
Good.
So how far to the shit?
It's right next door.
Come on.
I'll see you later.
You got your stuff?
Take him upstairs.
Come on, let's go.
Let me get a light.
Back!
Let's go!
Watch out!
Follow me, motherfucker!
High time, motherfuckers!
I'll kill you, motherfuckers!
Get off the fuckin' car, man!
You motherfucker!
Get off the fuckin' car, man!
Oh, shit!
Nobody rides for free, motherfucker!
Go! Go!
Shit! Fuck you!
Fuck you, motherfucker!
Slam your fuckin' brains out, Frank!
Get the fuck in front of 'em!
Oh, shit!
Get the fuck out the way!
Move your fuckin' car!
Move it outta the way!
Shit!
Shit!
They're gone.
I don't believe this.
I don't fuckin' believe this.
Wait, wait, wait.
What's that?
Nothing!
Fuck!
Come on, Jimmy!
It's me and you, buddy!
Where's Frank, huh?
Tired of being his fuckin' flunky?
I see he left you, huh?
Come out, Jimmy! Where you at!
It's me and you, Jimmy!
Hey, Jimmy, guess what?
I got a piece of chicken here!
You chicken-eatin' motherfucker!
Come on!
Come on, be like a man!
Jimmy!
Come on, Jimmy!
Just me and you!
Jimmy!
Let's talk it out, brother!
Come on!
Where the chicken at?
Yo, Black!
And a soda?
Where's my soda, Black?
You know I like soda.
What? What? What?
- Where's your girlfriend, motherfucker?
- Hey! Scumbag!
Fuck you!
Kill me, motherfucker!
Come on!
All right. You're not bad, you're not bad,
you're not bad. You gotta relax.
No, no, no. Listen, relax.
Can you take a breath?
Can you take a breath?
All right, let me help you.
Let me help you.
Tommy? Tommy?
Tommy!
Tom! Oh! You...!
Tommy? Tommy?
I got the motherfucker!
I killed the motherfucker!
Kill me!
I love you.
I love you, Tommy.
Daddy!
What am I gonna do without him!
You motherfuckin'...!
You motherfucker!
Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Hey. You.
Bring his ass over here!
- Get up! Get the fuck up!
- I can't get up! I can't get up!
Come on! Get up! Get up!
Where's Frank?
Get up. Frank's coming.
- Come on!
- Don't hurt me! Don't touch me!
- Don't fuckin' touch me!
- Yo! Chill! Chill! Chill!
Frank... Shit, man, listen.
You gotta listen to me, man.
Frank...
...they gave me some names. I checked
them out. They were fuckin' cool, man.
I had no reason to think they were cops,
man. Those motherfuckers set me up!
They set me up just as much as you,
Frank. You gotta believe me, man.
It ain't like it seems, Frank.
- It ain't like it seems.
- No me niegas.
No estoy negando, Frank.
Somos amigos. Just tell me why.
Don't lie to me, man. Just tell me why.
Just tell me why.
It was the money, all right?
It was the fuckin' money!
- Puta!
- Motherfucker!
Don't!
They offered me more money
than I'd ever seen, Frank.
I'd be in the protection programme.
I was out, man, I was free.
You can understand that.
- Where's the money now?
- We've got it.
He was carrying it around with him.
Bury it with him.
Frank... Frank...
Yo, Frank! Frank! Frank!
Frank!
I'm sorry, Frank! Frank!
Frank!
Frank, I'm sorry, man!
When the DA's office investigated
the sudden death of Arty Clay...
...they found that he left a $13 million
estate. How do you explain that?
Then there's Larry Wong, who owned
half of Chinatown when he passed away.
Larry used to rent his tenements...
...to Asian refugees, his own people...
...for $800 a month...
...to share a single toilet on the same floor.
How about King Tito?
He had 13-year-old girls
hooking for him on the street.
Those guys are dead...
...because...
...I don't wanna make money that way.
Emil Zapa.
The Mata brothers. They're dead...
...because... they were running this city
into the ground.
You expect to get away with
killing these people?
I spent half my life in prison.
I never got away with anything.
And I never killed anybody
that... didn't deserve it.
Who made you judge and jury?
Well, it's a tough job
but somebody's gotta do it.
Now, for the likes of Arty Clay
and the rest of those bums...
...you slap a tag on me for $50,000.
You make me public enemy...
number one.
Is that some kinda joke? Well...
I got a message for you and your friends.
You tell 'em I got a quarter-million-dollar
contract on anyone involved in this case.
Now we all get to know
what it's like not knowing...
...when some asshole's
gonna blow your head off.
I want you to know
what it's like to live that way.
You tell 'em what I said.
- And you'll still be around to see that?
- Where's the fuckin' phone?
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about
taking over drug cartels.
You think ambushing me is gonna
stop what makes people take drugs?
This country spends $100 billion a year
on getting high.
And it's not because of me,
all that time I was wasting in jail...
It just got worse.
I'm not your problem.
I'm just the businessman.
Take out your piece. Be careful.
Careful.
The cuffs.
Cuff yourself to the chair.
It's a stupid thing to do, huh?
Sit down. Put 'em on the chair.
Now you know what it's like.
Welcome... to the circle.
Bang, bang!
White.
A man with a price on his head
shouldn't ride the subway.
It's over.
- Let it go.
- You let it go.
See this?
Come on, you wanna see something?
How bad do you want me?
Don't worry, but don't move.
Frank, put the gun down.
And make it easy? I've done things
you wouldn't even think about.
Why should you be different?
You got that gun. Use it. Come on!
No more stories, Frank.
Put the fuckin' gun down.
See this woman? Nice woman.
Do you have a family?
I don't wanna hurt you, but I will blow you
away if I have to. You understand?
Yes, sir.
Could you do that?
Leave her alone, Frank. It's me and you.
Me and you.
You can't hide behind her for ever.
I don't need for ever.
Just drive.
