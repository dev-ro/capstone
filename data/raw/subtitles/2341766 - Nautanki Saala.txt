Ladies and gentlemen
please clap heartily.
Dramebaaz Theatre Company presents.
Raavan Leela welcomes you.
l am Ram Parmar, actor and director.
l request you to put your
hands in your neighbors pocket.
Please switch off their cellphone.
Plastic bags, hand bags..
Please exercise the same caution,
even with bangles.
Howeverthere is no rule
against laughing and clapping.
For your information all
the characters of this play.
Are not imaginary in the least.
So have fun.
A great actor is one who
can lie with utmost conviction.
And one who can lie
to uphold the truth.
That is a one hell of a drama queen!
The curtain neverfalls
on this real life drama.
This is why l can't
fall asleep doctor.
So you can't fall asleep?
Since when?
Mr. Parmar? Ram?
RP
lt's common for us creative
folks to face insomnia.
Doctor, you're a psychiatrist.
Just give me some sleeping pills.
And l'l be fine.
Since when are you
unable to fall asleep RP?
Forthe past three months.
You can't sleep even
for a few minutes?
Not a wink, even after
downing an entire bottle of rum.
Afull bottle!
Everyday? Forthree months?
Calories doctor. A human
body needs 2500 calories per day.
l need this since
l can't consume a morsel.
No food in three months?
What is the girl's name?
RP? C'mon its very common..even
l have gone through the same.
You shouldn't punish yourself
so much over one break-up!
Three break-ups! ln 3 months?
Actually that suicide attempt
Suicide attempt as well?
Suicide attempt..
lt happens. A break-up, then
loss of appetite, sleep then alcohol..
On top of that you're an actor.
All this culminating
in a suicide attempt.
No, no doctor. Reverse gear.
A suicide attempt started
this entire drama.
Drama. Please explain.
Doctor, there is a Chinese proverb.
Nee jo luh tah de sheng ming,
ta de ming jo you fuze.
lf you save a life,
you are responsible for it.
Go on.
l am a theatre actor, director.
3 months ago our
hit play 'Raavanleela'.
Had completed 1500 shows.
lt was also my girlfriend's birthday.
And, l was late to see her.
Hi Chitra!
Where are you?
Happy birthday!
Again? - Yeah once again.
l'lljust put you on speaker phone.
Hurry Up.
l'll be there soon.
You said the same thing an hour ago.
That actorwho plays Ram.
What that idiot?
Chandra sir had almost
packed him off today..
Why does my boyfriend have
to carry the weight of the world?
You know in life.
l know, in RP's rule book
everyone should get a second chance.
Bye, love you.
Oh shit!
Let go! - No!
Leave me! - No way!!
Don't move, careful.
My name is RP.
What's your name?
Be careful, you will cut yourself.
Don't move, don't shake!
What do you mean no?
Bro, where were you going?
lt's housefull up there man.
Listen. Go home.
Have l met him?
Met him? You danced with him!
Harish's wedding? Don't you remember?
Hey buddy! Are you ok?
What's his name?
Oh come on Chitra!
Don't embarrass me now!
He was part of our gang!
Buddy? He was the soul of the party!
Always smiling.
Full of..
Life.
So 'buddy'..
do you remember our dance?
Everyone will remembertoday's show!
Chandra sirwas so happy!
Show collections were five
lakhs fifty three thousand and..
and 390 rupees!
390 rupees.
How is the fish?
Dead!
No.
Bloody hell! Horrorfilm!
l almost died of a heart-attack!
l couldn't even take my own life.
l am good for nothing.
A burden on earth.
You shouldn't say this.
..especially about yourself.
l brought a rope..
..chose an auspiscious moment.
l was dying in peace.
Why did you save me? Why?
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry. Actually if l
hadn't seen you hanging that way.
l am genuinely sorry.
lt was my first time,
won't happen again.
Again?
Do you know how much courage it takes?
l'm sure.
God knows when l will
be able to try it next.
Why are you speaking like this?
Why don't you try living?
lt's not a bad idea.
Ask yourfamily.
Holy shit!
Holy shit!
You ok?
Holy shit holy cow bloody hell!
Oh God no! - Relax!
The only family l have is my ajji.
What?
Ajji means grandmother.
My grandmother. She raised me.
Good show.
She raised you well.
Two days ago l sent her a letter.
Suicide note!
Sent it?
Already?
lf she reads it.
Oh god!
OK. OK. You posted
it 2 days ago right?
So she will get it tomorrow?
We'll go there early in the morning
and grab it before she gets it.
No one will ever know
such a letterwas written.
Where does your ajji stay?
My leg was in a cast when
Harish got married. Fracture.
Oh Yeah! lt was hurting real bad.
lt hurts even more when you lie to me.
Trust is very important
in a relationship.
Well that guy.
You don't even know his name.
lf l had asked his name,
he would be dead by now.
He was committing suicide.
Oh my god.
l am sorry.
People like asking for help,
you like helping them and l like you.
lt is like a vicious cycle.
You could have dropped
him at his place instead.
That's what l am
about to do sweetheart.
He won't stay here for another minute.
l'll drop him at his grandma's place.
lmmediately and be
back before you know it.
Where does she stay?
Nearby Not too far.
Where exactly?
How do l explain this? l'll
go straight, then left, then right.
And then continue straight
on the expressway via Chemburto Pune!
Sorry?
Why are you sorry?
''The world's asleep.
The sky's asleep.''
''The world's asleep.
The sky's asleep.''
''The destinations are asleep.''
''So are the routes.''
''The world's asleep.
The sky's asleep.''
''The destinations are asleep.''
''So are the routes.''
''The world's asleep.
The sky's asleep.''
This is the accelerator
and his is the clutch?
Actually opposite this.
Yes.
There is a brake as well?
l should drive.
''As the night grew those with homes,
slept in their homes.''
''As the night grew vagabonds like us,
were lost in the darkness.''
''The destinations are asleep.''
''So are the routes.''
Stop.
stop stop!
That is my ajji's house. Go.
Me?
Definitely not me!
lf she has survived my letter.
Then she will definitely die on
seeing me, thinking that l am a ghost.
Who do you want?
Hello Ajji.
Who are you?
l am a friend of your grandson.
Mandar's friend?
Yes yes Mandars friend.
l wanted his birth certificate.
Now?
When Mandarwas growing up.
He had attended a theatre workshop.
He seemed so happy!
He had written me a
beautiful letterfrom there.
His first letter.
And?
And now this l received
it just this morning.
Have you read it?
l just had a cataract operation dear.
How can l read it?
You read it for me.
of course ajji,Who better
than me to read Mandar's letter!
l waited so long for someone
to come along and read it to me.
Read son read.
Tell me quickly!
My dearest,ajji my respects.
My Mannu best wishes
to him,read ahead.
My life is a disaster.
Was.
Now it's moving along beautifully.
Nobody was willing to give me company.
Job!
But now l've got a good job
and plenty of respect in the office.
l'm very sorry l couldn't call you.
Where does he work?
lt is a very big company ajji.
Really? So they pay him too?
Pay? He says he's a manager!
With a lot of respect, he adds.
How is this possible?
Why, ajji?
Mannu is a 12th grade fail.
They were so awed by my personality.
They didn't even ask
me for qualifications!
l can't believe it.
Mandar can only do one thing.
What ajji?
When you can't do anything else,
you become an actor dear.
And what happens to the
person who can't even act?
He becomes a director.
Zero respect for artists.
That's all he has written ajji.
Wait son.
Hasn't he written
anything about Nandini?
Bloody drama queen!
Yes, Nandini's the past now.
He's over her.
The 'totally over,
no chance of going back' type.
Wonderful!
l expected this from my Mandar.
l forgot to tell you, he's also
written that he's found someone else.
She's a doctor.
And a model.
Homely doctor model.
And now l'm off to commit suicide.
What?
Commit myself to a new business.Start
it myself. Something like that.
Ok, read on.
Just this much.
Seeking your blessings, Mandar.
Ok Ajji, l should leave.
Wait, you came by car right?
Yes, why?
The dholak is placed properly right?
Yes ajji.
Where is yourtemple? Close-by?
Still far away. Come close.
l have to tell you a secret.
Something's been bothering
me for many days.
There are some medicines
on the dashboard if you need.
Do you know Nandini?
Would you like chewing gum?
Nandini. She had called
me six months back.
Let me check for Marathi
songs on the radio.
She was so upset!
She felt that Mandar
wasn't happy with her.
Should l turn up the air conditioning?
You must be feeling hot.
She started asking
what should l do Ajji?
How should l make him happy?
l told her straight 'you
can bring a donkey nearwater.
. He might also drink it,
but will that make him a horse?'
NO!
l asked her do you
want to see Mandar happy?
Then leave him.
She cried a lot!
But l convinced her ultimately.
Then she just vanished
from Mandar's life.
Just like Seeta had disappeared.
Has anything happened to my dholak?
Your dholak is fine.
No one would enjoy doing
this to one' own grandson.
Great. That's my temple.
Carefully Ajji.
Now l realize why you saved me.
So that l would live to see this day.
My own blood has betrayed me.
Good god. l am good for nothing.
Sorry.
''My heart's always
surrounded by grief.''
''There's just darkness
in my life now.''
''ln darkness.''
Hey Chitra.
Did you drop him off?
Actually what happened is.
Oh God RP.
Please don't get involved in this.
Mark my words, you'll be caught
between hospitals and police stations.
l know.
Even your rule book doesn't
permit a third chance
l will do something love.
Should l call a cab for you?
Anyway. VT station is that
way and a bus stop is this way.
Can't l wait here?
Wait forwhom buddy?
l have to go to work.
Come on, don't be like this.
Brother, l am not putting up an act.
l am really acting in a play.
l have directed it.
l am also an actor.
l am a nobody.
Come on!Your ajji said.
She said that you liked
acting when you were young.
Then come watch my play.
You'll love it. Come on.
Can't we go by your car?
This the last warning. Go!
Don't worry Seeta mummy.
if he troubles you one
more time he will be gone.
Oh!Director sir is here.
Let's talk later. - Hi Sita
Chandra sir l want a ticket.
Why can't you say it at least once?
'Mr.Producer l have a role for you.'
Yes of course l was
almost about to say it.
But l need a ticket right now,
for a special guest.
lf it's a paying guest
only then it's special for me.
Otherwise it's nothing.
Don't mind RP l don't mix
friendship with Laxmi Mummy.
Here's yourticket.
l'll see you afterthree hours.
Okay.
Three hours?
There is an interval. People have
some snacks there, at the canteen.
Snacks?
You can have some too.
Ok. Take care.
Can l come inside with you?
Why? This is the best
seat in the entire theatre!
Special seat.
This will definitely fall on me.
How do you know?
Something always
keeps on falling on me.
l am a favourite with
the pigeons and crows.
This theatre was built by the British.
A hundred and seventy years ago.
BMC has not even glanced at it once.
Nothing has fallen till date.
There is a first time for everything.
Mercy Lord Mercy.
Who?
Who has dared to do this to my sister?
Who?
l will teach him such a lesson.
That even the God of
Death will start fearing me.
Who has done this?
The second son of King Dashrath,
the king of Ayodhya.
The younger brother of Ram my Lord.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty?
The second son of King Dashrath?
Ram's younger brother?
Lakshman!
Lakshman .
Where is he?
Who?
Who is where, Your Majesty?
Lakshman! Who else?
ls he like this with you too?
What do you mean?
What l mean is 'Aren't
you two close to each other?'
Now you are not a real life Seeta.
To stop him from coming in your house.
You are not a real life Ram either.
l have heard that Ram's
wife is accompanying him.
So now that we are at the hospital,
should we go to the police?
lt was an accident! He will
fine once he is here for a day ortwo.
And afterthat?
Fill up the form quickly
else the patient will die.
Sorry?
Fill up the form quickly
else the patient will die.
Madam is saying fill up the form
quickly else the patient will die.
Your patient is one
hell of a drama queen!
Really?
What do you want to do?
Can you do me a favour?
Go ahead.
l even asked that nurse,
but he didn't listen to me.
Tell me.
l want some morphine.
Morphine is a drug! Drug is the enemy!
Future is black when sugar is brown.
He is getting it. From that blue tube.
But why?
Please share it with
me for just ten minutes.
lt is hurting real bad.
Please give me some morphine!
lt is not so simple.We
can both go to jail!
l already feel like l am in a jail.
Mandar stop.
You won't get any morphine.
Give me some morphine!
Mandar. You shouldn't
frighten the patient.Stop!
But l want morphine!
Don't you dare.
Morphine. Morphine!
You need to live a little
instead of asking for morphine.
And you can't find life in such tubes.
You need to go out and find it,
meet new people.
You are right l need to find it.
Thank you.
l am very grateful.
You are welcome.
You are beautiful, a beautiful person.
Just like my Nandini.
Same to same. Have you ever met her?
My Nandini is very beautiful!
Who knows where she is,
what she is doing.
ls this cotton or polyester?
Nandini wears only cotton clothes.
l miss her. l don't know
whether now she is a Miss or Mrs.

Nandini!
Hi.
Should we talk to him?
Do you know a good doctor?
He has some kind of a throat problem.
Not.
His throat RP, about his life.
Don't get started on his life now.
He is heart-broken.He hates himself.
No, no. Flip side. He's a narcissist.
AWhat?
Someone who loves himself a whole lot.
Like Devdas.
Oh, ok.
And Mandar is not a normal narcissist.
He is a wounded narcissist.
Stop it now. He is my friend
now and he isn't all that bad.
Wounded narcissist
Bad! He's good.
How do you expect the poor
thing to handle so much pressure?
Pressure?
His best friend is getting married.
That's pressure no?
But what does our marriage
have to do with Mandar?
He will now want to
repay the loan, wont he?
Loan?
RP. You have spent so much on him.
lf he is not able to repay that
he will naturally feel pressurized.
And he won't feel like
staying here forever.
l am requesting on his behalf.
please help him stand on his feet!
He was standing on
a suitcase four days back.
And he is still standing there.
To flow with the water
he has to first jump in it.
Don't just give him fish,
teach him how to fish!
Hello.
Ram is dead fish.
But Chandra sir?
He didn't spare even Shurpanakha.
She's quit!
So l am sending our
Ram on permanent exile.
Chandra sir how do we?
find a replacement
on such short notice?
l have already found
two-three options.
Let me know if you
have someone in mind.
Chandra sir how can l think
of options on the spur of the moment?
''Glory to Sri Ram.''
''Glory to Sri Ram.''
''Glory to Sri Ram.''
What can Mandar do?
RP tell me quick
who can play Ram's role?
l have just the man.
Pardon me Sita. l was bringing
the deerto console you.
to protect you.
Ok!
What a bore.
He is stretching it man.
Just say the end line.
What?
Are you sure you want to marry RP?
Of course. Why?
Because l think he is retarded.
This actor is oozing talent
and l don't even have a drop of it.
No Mandar.
RP has rehearsed
with you so many times.
Just believe in yourself
and go say your lines confidently.
lt's pretty easy.
Hanging myself from
that tree was easier.
RP We cannot find a better
Ram in this time and age.
He is as good an actor as me.
Confirm him.
l think he is too generic.
Very common.
Common man wants this.
A hero. Veerassa
Veerassa? Please. Very lame.
l think we should
look at other options.
Mandar Lele?
Mahi, l am going home.
No. You are going on stage.
Mandar Lele? Mandar Lele?
Who was saying great things
about him the other day?
Go.Go.
Naseer sir?
You mean Naseeruddin Shah?
Yes. Resume?
Yes. He's the one!
See see!
Topper at London School of Drama.
He was as good as kidnapped
by New York Broadway.
Thank God Paresh Sir
brought him to Mumbai.
Paresh Rawal?
Should we start?
Ok. Mandar Lele.
Let's do Ram's monologue
after Seeta is kidnapped.
So l'll give you 3 counts.
You take it from there.
Ready? 3,2,1 start.

Exile!
My real exile has started.
Please come back.
Seete!Come back.
One more time.
You're good. You're very good.
You have created a revolution
on this audition stage.
The way you stayed in character
while seemingly out of it.
How do you do that?
Audience will definitely
go out after seeing this.
Only a few people
can actually understand.
the importance of this performance.
Only those whose hearts pump for
theatre can catch these undercurrents.
l will require a shock treatment
with all these currents. l will die.
Art for a director,
heart attack for a producer!
Don't take it to your heart Mandar.
You're good, you should know that.
Just wait forthe call.
Ok? Keep that down. Good.
One minute.
l want to take his volume test.
You must have done
this before Mr Mandar Lele.
Like this.
Volume up.
Volume down.
Now you do it.
Ready?
Are you a singer as well?
What a ham!
Mandar le le?
Take Mandar.
RP actually you are perfect for Ram.
Natural role for you.
We all know that RP
is a great human being.
Wow.
However he is still
a mere human being.
And human beings are
prone to committing mistakes.
What is your point Chandra sir?
Suicide point.
What do you mean?
l won't let you take your
careerto a suicide point!
Forget RP.
RP? RP
Freeze!
Turn slowly.
Stand.
Doesn't he look like a complete..
Total!

Do you really want a role Chandra sir?
Of course!

And Ram will be played by Mandar Lele.
Done.
Cheers to that.

He is a bigger dog than

sis in laws nephews nephew?
lts such a one sided affair.
l am the only one who is faithful.
He's not faithful at all!
Open your eyes and ears madam.
There is no network here at all.
''You're such dramebaaz,
l am a dramabaaz.''
''Everyone's a dramebaaz.''
Oh Loli a little slowly.
lt's broken.
Broken.
Looks badly broken.
lt will never be fixed.
Yeah, no chance.
Nandu l want to talk.
Shut Up!
Don't mind!
Nandu, just cheel.
Want some water? Cold drink?
Get out!
Please don't mind!
lt's getting a little awkward.
l think l should leave.
Wait don't leave please.
l'll give you another plant.
Okay.
Nandu. What you saw there.
And heard.
Yeah that too but it just happened.
lt wasn't from my heart.
Really, it wasn't from my heart.
l don't want to know where
that was from. You and that..
Hey, it was nothing.
lt was absolutely casual.
And then suddenly
she was all over my lips.
And look at my luck,
you had to catch me then.
See, l'll do one thing.Look
Wiped it off. Now l'm fresh. Cheel.
Nandini, this happens.
Hey, Sir.
Me?
Yes you.
Please explain to
herthat this happens.
l don't think so.
lt's never happened with me,
norwith my friends.
Why should l lie man?
Nandini, listen, please.
Go from here Lokesh. You're a dog!
Hey. l'm your puppy.
Yourfavourite puppy.
Who just got caught
up in a silly kiss.
But l'm all yours Nandu.
lt's over Lokesh.
lt's over.
Loki Loli.
l think it's best if you just leave.
Trust me buddy.
Cheel!
And now!
The next contestant to
try and lift this bow and win.
Princess Seeta's hand in marriage.
The eldest son of King
Dashrath of Ayodhya Ram!
''Glory to Sri Ram.''
Lord of lords Mahadev's grand bow
Will be broken today.
By the grand archer.
Sri.
Ram.
''Glory to Sri Ram.''
''Glory to Sri Ram.''
And in that manner
Sri Ram lifted the bow.
And broke it.
You know something?
l'm frightened of loneliness.
Nandini.
George Washington said it is better
to be alone than be in bad company.
But life is meant to
be shared with someone.
Not if that 'someone'
is an unfaithful dog.
How can you ever be
with such a man again?
l know Loli has made a mistake.
But forgiving him will be
an even bigger mistake. Trust me.
How so?
Just imagine its a
hypothetical situation.
lf Loli tells you he's
stepping out to buy vegetables.
What would you think?
That we don't get
vegetables near my building.
Genius.
Of course, exactly!
So then where did he go? To a hotel?
A hotel room? A car?
ln the backseat of a car? With a girl?
Enough!
l'm sorry.
l didn't want to make you cry.
l want you to see
ahead of the darkness.
There is light outside of it.
Where you will find a valiant leader,
worthy of your loyalty.
Yourfearless leader.
Not someone. You.
Ok, you. You, take care of yourself.
l'lljust leave ok?
That day, you saved my order.
And today me from breaking apart.
Well, l guess this is
what you call a coincidence.
Yes.
Yes.
Please give your blessings RP.
Live long.
My brother.
Shurpnakha?
Did you see that?
Yes.
Then why don't you
do something about it?
What is bothering you?
He has humiliated me!
You couldn't save my honour.
Atleast save your Lanka!
What do you want?
Finish him!
Whom?
Ram!
ls he that bad?
He is a culprit.
Move.
Do you know how he holds the bow?
And what is that
noise his throat makes?
Amitabh Bachchan's voice
was rejected by All lndia Radio.
Do you know the name
of the person who rejected it?
Nobody knows.
Only those people are remembered.
who can find a diamond in a coal mine.
A diamond.
ls this Raavan Leela orthe circus?
lf this is Amitabh Bachchan.
then l am MGM's lion.
Meow!
Fire him tonight and end this circus!
Mandar. Which is your
favourite restaurant?
Let's go afterthe show for drinks.
Was l that bad?
Not at all dude.There
is some good news for you.
Give it to me now, please.
Patience dearfriend.
The timing and lighting for
this good news must be perfect.
Okay.
Why should l come to dinner?
Chandra fired him from the show.
ls that your good news.
l won't be able to see that.
He is so cute!
Control Seete control.
l Mandar might be getting fired
from the role of Ram but this Raavan.
Has made sure that his real-life
Seeta is around the corner.
Sorry?
You'll be sorry.
lf you miss this moment.
l got down
l have directed his Nandini's
real-life drama so brilliantly!
Here l will tell him
that she is available.
There Nandini will be running
towards Mandar in slow motion.
And then the fact that he
has been fired won't mean a thing.
Just pay forthe champagne.
What?
This was Nandini's favourite
restaurant, mine too.
lt still is.
We used to come here all the time.
OKeverybody! The good news is.
Yes?
ls that Chandra has decided
to make him Ram permanently.
l am sorry.
Excuse me.
Which was the scene
that he liked most?
lnterval.
Raavan, photo. Raavan, photo.
Of course.
Ok, l'm Raavan. Hi, hello.
No no no, with Raavan. Photo. Raavan.
Your Mandar Lele is ruining
me even in his last show.
l feel like crying!
These tickets are good
only for making paper rockets.
Even those will go farther
than your Ram's arrows.
Clapping! Go inside, clapping.
Welcome to lndia. Big show.
Hey Abhi. l have heard that
when'Bombay to Goa' was being shot.
That time the great Mahmood Sir.
Told the entire unit to
applaud whatever Mr Bachchan did.
lt worked wonders on
getting his confidence back.
l really need you to be Mahmood
Sirfor one of my actors today.
Please consider it
an actorto actor appeal.
Only a theatre actor
has the powerto grasp.
The audience with his performance.
Let's go.
Come on. Come on.
''Glory to Sri Ram.''
''Glory to Sri Ram.''
''Glory to Sri Ram.''
Come on, pack up and leave.
Chandra Sir.

Chandra Sir. Fantastic.
What a show! Very well done.
You know my name Abhi sirji.
You know RP.
Yeah.
You know RP, your new Ram
takes the show to a whole new level.
What's his name?
Actually his name is.
Mandar Lele.
He is my discovery. Abhishesh sir.
Really.
Yes.
Abhiji l am telling you
if l was auditioning yourfather.
.At All lndia Radio then
l would have never rejected him.
Just think what would have happened.
Ah there is Mandar, Chandra sir.
l willjust give him your message.
Which message?
That one your honour and his end!
What honour RP?
lf Mandar is Amit sir
then you are MGM's lion meow.
You have a great sense of humour!
Leave it.
Anyway how do you know Abhishesh?
l will tell you later.
K. Abhishe-K.
Abhishe-K.
Take money, take photo.
Take money, take photo.
Ram. Ram. Ram.
''Glory to Sri Ram.''

on earth anymore Mandar.
Live up to your potential Mandar.
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
''You're such dramebaaz,
l am a dramabaaz.''
''Everyone's a dramebaaz.''
''You're such dramebaaz,
l am a dramabaaz.''
''Everyone's a dramebaaz.''
Hanuman, keep my ring with you.
When you meet Seeta,
then show it to her.
She will definitely talk to you then.
And do tell herthat l
am going to rescue her very soon.
And tell herthat.
l think of her all the time.
Long live Sri Ram.
Long live Sri Ram.
Long live Sri Ram.
How was l?
Even l think of you with
every breath l take My Lord.
Mandar?
What happened?
Mandar! Mandar!
Mandar!
Ram is supposed to
be on stage in two minutes.
Do something RP.
Mandar!
Mandar open the door.
Mandar open the door.
Hello! What?
l don't want to do it anymore.
But you are so good at it.
Everyone likes you.
Abhishek Bachchan himself.
My heart is pining.
For Abhishek?
For Nandini.
Her eyes.
Her skin is so soft.
And you know what? Whenever she
used to lay her beautiful eyes on me.
.She used to stroke
her neck just like this.
What?
Yes.
She would gently caress it.
That used to be my green signal.
And then l would.
You have an entry in one minute!
l don't want to go on stage anymore.
Mandar!
Stop acting! This is a theatre.
Being a drama queen won't work here.
You and your show. That is
all you care about in this world!
You are so so..
What 'so'? What?
Self-centred.Selfish.
lnconsiderate.lnsensitive.
Selfish?Me?
l have literally been your
baby-sitter and changed your diapers.
.l don't like to boast Mandar.
but actors will kill
forthis Ram's role!
l was killing myself.
But you saved me and made me Ram!
You are exploiting my talent,
crushing my feelings!
Mandar.
Then the glorious Hanuman found Sita.
l will kill you!
Then kill me! lt is much
betterthan living without Nandini!
l will gladly sacrifice
myself for Nandini.
He has lost his mental balance.
For Janaknandini Seeta!
You have come to help me out again.
How much can you handle
when you are alone?
Now that LoLi is completely
out of your life right?
Because it's best that way.
But keep in mind that he will
try his best to get back with you.
Take you out for dinner maybe
to yourfavourite restaurant.
Candle light dinner and you
will start melting before the candles.
And then anyway it's
your personal matter.
No say it.
Well l don't know what
the equation is between you two.
But you should be
aware of how men think.
Theirthinking pattern.
Anyway let's change the
topic it's getting very personal.
No no tell me. The thinking pattern,
what were you saying?
Well if man is a dog then
his thoughts are like a dog's tail.
Doesn't change at all.
One track mind always
thinking of that one thing.
That thing?
That thing.
lt is getting very personal.
And the thinking pattern
is not just LoLi's.
.But about all those
men who are narcissists.
Who are what?
Narcissists.
Those who love themselves a lot!
Like Shahrukh from 'Devdas'.
Oh?
And LoLi isn't your normal narcissist.
He is a wounded narcissist.
What are you saying?
Shahrukh from 'Darr'.
DDD Dangerous combination.
Someone who has been rejected.
The magic in your eyes!
Narcissists don't want to hear a 'no'.
They stick to you like a
chewing gum sticks to your shoe.
See?
Hello.
Can we meet today?
l can't meet you today.
Tomorrow?
Not even tomorrow!
Ok, day after?
Never!
Why?
Because you.
Please Nali please.
You are a wounded narcissist!
Wounded narco?
What?
Google it!
l don't know what l will do now.
Life is beautiful Nandini.
Go out and bask in the sun,
get drenched in the rain.
Revive old friendships.
But with whom?
You will love my favourite restaurant.
Sorry?
l was thinking if you are
free for dinnertonight then..
No No lt's Sunday, how can l make it?
Oh sorry.
l became a little too personal.
No it's ok.
l don't want to go out with Lokesh.
But l can't avoid him
as he lives in my building.
He will definitely
persuade me to be with him.
And do you know?
l am very afraid of being alone.
l know.
What makes you think l'm angry?
l can see.
l made chicken biryani just for you.
Forthe first time in my life.
And you are going out.
We will go for dinnertomorrow.
Like the time we
had gone on my birthday?
Hey come on Chitra.
l was seriously beginning to feel
that you weren't serious about us.
But then suddenly you proposed,
so beautifully.
l thought we were
ready forthe next level.
But no! We are back to square one!
l am going for a meeting.
While having dinner?
lt's urgent.
Can't you postpone it?
By tomorrow someone
else will seal the deal.
Trust me, if this comes through,
we'll be the happiest.
lt's very tasty.
So.
Why is this restaurant so special?
Food, ambience.
Beautiful memories?
My memories are farfrom beautiful.
But memories help keep
us going during difficult times.
Like who had you mentioned
that day umm Mandar?
lt was Mandar, right?
How do you know Mandar?
How can l know him?
You were the one chanting his name.
lmpossible!
Well, you were crying remember? l
was handing out tissues and you went.
'Why is all this
happening to me Mandar.'
Really?
Yes.
l don't remember.
How can you remember?
You were distressed and probably
that's why you thought of him.
Yeah.
You know your heart's
trying to tell you something.
They have a unique way of reminding.
You of the people
you cannot live without.
Yes and Mandar.
ls definitely not one of them.
People change.
Not Mandar.
We were so hopeless together.
24/7 l had to take care of him.
Like a plant.
But you are very good with plants.
Only with those in my shop,
not in real life.
l want someone who will
lovingly take care of me.
Excuse me.
Take it off.
You're on a date, make sure
your boyfriend doesn't look away.
Where can you find such
men who have eyes for only you?
Don't take it off then.
Seems like you came with Mr. wrong.
No no. The one l came with.
He saved me from Mr. wrong.
Drama. Perhaps he is Mr. right.
How will l know?
Sweetie its 2013.
You are in control.
Me. How?
Be coy. Be dramatic.
ln real love.
You need it.
l don't buy that.
Cool.
One day you will realize a little
drama is needed to get to the truth.
Bye.
RP!
RP!
Hey wassup?
l was trying to catch your eye.
For a long while,
but you don't notice me!
Really.
So still upset?
Don't be silly! So are you
having your dinner meeting here?
Yeah.
Same pinch!
Didn't you prepare biryani,
then how did you end up here?
My fiance ditched
me on our dinner date.
So a sweet friend of his
brought me here for dinner.
What?
You jealous?
Mandar is here too?
Yes, we are sitting overthere.
Where is your VlP party?
Producer.
Looks very young.
His father earns and this
guy spends it. Usual shit.
Don't get Mandar here.
Why?
l'm trying to give him a surprise.
lmpressing the producer.
We're making a production
with Mandar in the lead.
ln Delhi, outside Bombay.
Afterthat just assume that
l've made Mandar into a fisherman.
l love you!
Thank you.
Go.
You go.
Please go.
You go.
Go on.
You go on.
Sorry- lt's Okay.
Remember me?
Hi.

Just wanted to give him this.
Don't kidnap him ok?
He's mine.

Vikas?
Right, Vikas.
But you had undergone
a sex-change operation.
Yeah, so l repeated the procedure.
Undo.
Now back to pavilion.
Sorry, old friend.

No.
Yup. Should we leave?
lts stopped raining.
ls lovely outside.
Okay let's go.
So where do you stay?
Nearby first left.
Chitra.
Chitra Housing Society.
Too many mosquitoes these days.
Are you okay?
Yeah l am fine.
So l have heard.
that every flower
has a specific meaning?
Yes.
Like a red rose means.
l know what it means.
ls there any Facebook
type flower in your shop?
Facebook type flower?
Something that says it's complicated?
But if you honestly
speak your heart out..
Why should it be complicated?
lt will be a disaster if l do that.
Then give that special
person some flowers.
l did just that and got trapped.
But the flowers gave a message
which l neverwanted to convey.
Oh!
What happened?
l am getting very confused.
Chuck it. lt's complicated.
Chitra.
l had a wonderful time. Thanks.
Hey. There is no sorry
orthanks in friendship.
Kiss me.
No kiss me. Definitely no kiss me.
LoLi!
LoLi?
He is watching us.
So?
lf he sees us kiss then
he will never pester me again.
Serious.
Yes.
Ram please kiss me.
No.
No dialogue
Thanks.
Welcome.
Good night.
Good night.
''Come back to me, beloved.''
''Come back to me, beloved.''
''l yearn for you.''
''Come closerto me.''
''l yearn for you.''
''l yearn.. for you.''
''Why do you seem like a dream?''
''Why do you seem like a dream?''
''There's a fire burning in my eyes.''
''My heart's only for you.''
''You're my life, my soul.''
''Come closerto me.''
''l yearn for you.''
''l yearn.. for you.''
''Come back to me..''
''Come back to me..''
Where are you going?
Not me, her.
What!
Permanently.
Why?
She couldn't take
your daily drama anymore.
Taxi.
l do a daily drama!
Flower, flower.
The flower you gave another girl!
She saw it.
Are you serious?
Yes.
As soon as we came home
she started packing up.
You didn't do anything?
Of course l did!
l gave her my suitcase.
What?
Yeah, she didn't have a bag.
You didn't say anything?
Course l did!
l said l can understand your pain..
..l've gone through it and..
Oh shut up!
Taxi!
Chitra, Chitra,
come on please, please hear me out!
Drive on please.
Chitra, she was Nandini.
Mandar's girl!
l was trying to patch them up.
God promise!
Stop the car please.
And take the bag out as well.
Don't go.
Chitra, what's the point of this
drama in the middle of the street?
lf you have any problem
we can sort it out at home.
So you can lie to me again.
My problem isn't that girl,
who is quite hot by the way.
Nor is it Mandar, who is very sweet.
Hey come on, l'm hot and sweet too.
Sorry, it's not enough.
Honesty is important too.
Don't be annoyed by these little lies.
Which are lies at the end of the day!
Lies you only tell me..
..because you don't want
to share your problems with me.
l will be alone even
when l am with you.
l don't want that.
Chitra, l love..
At least don't lie to yourself.
You're not that good an actor.
Stop playing God Ram.
lf you can't tell Mandarthen
at least tell Nandini the truth.
Keep her away from this drama.
Let's go.
Hi..
l want to talk to you.
ln fact l was going to call you.
Really?
Actually, l wanted to tell you that.
l am sorry.
Actually,
whatever happened that night.
l kept kissing you because
Lokesh was still standing there.
l know!
He was looking.
Yes.
l was just waiting for him to leave.
And till then we kept acting.
Yes.
And that's why l held yourwaist
tightly.
And that's why l hugged you.
Very lovingly.
Yes.
And that's why l..
Held yourface, in these hands.
lt was all a drama.
You're quite a natural actor.
l am an actor.
You gave one hell of a
performance without being one.
Very natural.
lt's great.
That we could clear
all this with honesty.
Truth will prosper.
''Come back to me, beloved.''
''Come back to me, beloved.''
''Come back to me, beloved.''
''l yearn.. for you.''
RP.
RP.
What RP RP! Can't you see
that l don't want to talk right now?
Ok, tell me, what is it?
Take it.
For me?
lt's got your name on it too.
l have nevertold you this but
RP because of you today l feel light.
l don't feel like
l'm a burden on earth.
l have found my calling.
Actually,
l'm alive today, only because of you.
Don't you think all
this is a repeat telecast?
l've said all this before?
When you were high on morphine.
Make up with Chitra.
Tell herthat her nemesis
Mandarwon't be in herway anymore.
What are you saying?
Yes.
You know the guy who plays Hanuman?
He's got a double
bed in his single room.
l even finished packing up.
l used your suitcase though,
hope you don't mind.
l wish everyone finds
a friend like you.
l'll be back.
Mandar, Mandar!
l have found Nandini.
Brilliant!
Bombastic!
Mind-blasting!
Yay! You found my Nandini!
RP where? Tell me, how is she?
Marriage? Marriage?
No.
Have you seen her?
Yes, but from far.
Now do you understand why
it was so hard to get over her?
She's beautiful, even from a distance.
Come on.
Right away?
Yes.
Are you crazy?
l just want to see where she lives.
That's all.
l can sense her vibrations.
vibes!
Shall we move on now?
Yeah.
Parking is this way.
Heaven is this way.
Stairway to Heaven is under
construction. Try and understand.
Just one 'Hi'.
Then you can call an ambulance.
My heart will be pumping
rose milk-shake by then.
Don't forget who you are now Mandar.
Ram. A leader!
Valiant! Milk-shake days are over!
Fearless leader. Fearless leader.
Let me go now.
DO you really want to go there?
Remember she ditched you!
What should l do then?
Show some attitude dude.
Play hard to get.
Do something such that.
she will come to you.
Stop being childish.
Rose milk-shake..
''The girl's hot.''
With ice-cream..
''She's like tequila shot.''
''The heart's in trouble.''
What is he doing here?
Do you know him?
No. Not at all
What is he doing with Nandini?
Leave her alone you dog!
She doesn't love him.
What? l can't tell from here
whetherthat person is male orfemale.
..Then how do you know
that Nandini doesn't love him?
Profile test.
Profile test? Means?
lt's Simple. lf she loved him then
she would have faced him straight.
Face to face..
but she is showing her profile..
..Which can only
mean one thing no love!
lt's science.
Yes!
Go back loser.
!Take your profile
and get it out of here.
You are my guru RP!
Loli.
No Profile. Nandini, profile!
Profile!
Mandar!
This is forceful entry.
How can he do this?
That too forcefully.
Let's call the police.
That inspector is yourfriend right?
How much will he
charge for an encounter?
Why did you take me
there in the first place?
Right, l dragged you there.
Then why did you
say that she is single?
l only said that she isn't married.
She can invite whoever
she wants to her bedroom.
Why are you saying this?
l can see that image now!
Why did you have to say bedroom?
How does the room matter at all?
lf it has to be done,
it can be done anywhere!
Hall, staircase.
On the kitchen shelf.
Bathroom,
in the shower, on the dining table.
Terrace, underthe open sky.
Why are you increasing the images.
lmages.
Now jabbing your eyes won't help.
Fact is fact.
l think it's time that we.
l mean you accept it and move on.
lf you had feelings
for her like l do then.
Then probably l could understand
what you really felt right now.
l am leaving now.
''lt's pounding. The heart's scared.''
''lt's pounding. The heart's scared.''
''Beloved, let go.
Don't pluck this bud.''
''You're my sweetheart.
You're so beautiful.''
You don't know how
l controlled myself.
He is safe because l am a vegetarian.
lf you hadn't been a pure vegetarian.
l would have made minced
meat of that RP the other day.
You don't know anything
about Ram..so refrain. Ok!
This. Oh!
All the best.
What do you know about him?
He doesn't make me
feel like l am all alone.
He taught me how to
get drenched in the sun.
And bask in the rain.
And when he holds me.
l just melt in his big, strong arms.
..Cheel.
''You're my relief. You're my love.''
''My life's connected with yours.''
''l've your vivid memories.
lt makes me breathless''
''lt makes my eyes wet.''
''My heart says.''
''Don't every go away.''
''Let me touch your lips.''
''Let me dwell in your breath.''
Bloody hell.
Absolute bloody hell.
''Beloved, let go.''
''Don't pluck this bud.''
''You're my sweetheart.
You're so beautiful.''
''lt's pounding. The heart's scared.''
''lt's pounding. The heart's scared.''
''Your spell's working.
lt's enthralling me.''
''l'm losing my senses..''
You won't believe
what l did yesterday!
l climbed to her
balcony like Spider man.
Oh God! Who does that? So juvenile.
The point is that you
were absolutely right!
Tea.
Me? About what?
She doesn't love that baboon!
She was alone when l reached there.
l just kept looking at her.
l was about to go in.
Then?
l remembered what
you told me yesterday.
What exactly?
She should miss me.
She must get impressed
with me somehow.
..l was thinking of a makeover,
new look, new hairstyle.
What are you thinking of?
l am thinking how l should kidnap her.
Kidnap, Your Majesty?
Yes! l will steal his love.
That will be worse than killing him!
RP, what is this?
RP!
RP. RP.
You'll have to ring the bell.
Bell? - Yes.
Doorbell. He's way too drunk right
now. l'll go find the replacement.
No no, he'll be fine. Rp, Rp?
Ding dong?
Yes?
Oh. You. l don't want to buy anything.
Thank you.
Hey stop all this.
Come on, we have to go.
No. l will not go. l will not go.
What is going on?
lt's time for ourwar
You will fight me? Will you?
Do you know everything now?
Yes, you have kidnapped my Sita,
so now there will have to be a war.
Kidnapped? Me? No! l..only.. once.
Once? You'll have
to do it every night!
Every night?
Yes.
You're saying this.
What has the world come to?
l want to hide from myself! Hide!
Rp! Ram!
l'm not Ram. l'm Raavan.
l'm Raavan disguised as Ram.
Actually,
you're Ram disguised as Raavan.
And that's Seeta. My entry's
from the right wing. l'm going.
Ok ok, maybe there's no need
for an entry. Just lie down for a bit.
l want to tell everyone
how great you are.
And you're my bff.
l have kidnapped your Seeta.
l'm guilty!
There's no need to feel guilty.
You drank a bit, it's fine.
l'm not guilty about that.
How can l kidnap yourwife?
How can l just take your girl man?
You're ok with kidnapping right?
l have no issues.
Let's go.
Listen to me this one time,
go and meet Chitra.
l am going to the saloon.
Do you want more milk?
ln your coffee?
Holy shit!
l used to be theirtarget before,
seems you are stealing my luck dude!
So what do you have in mind?
l want to impress a special friend.
Just make me sexy types.
Ohkay. Sexy types!
How is the taste
of your special friend?
What?
How is her hairstyle?
Just like her. Beautiful.
Seems like the special
friend is truly special.
Soft.
Very soft hair.
That's nice.
And they move like this,
like this, wavy.
Long. Sometimes she leaves it open.
And when they trouble herface.
She ties it up into a top bun.
And pushes a clip through it.
ls she a special friend to both?
l think l should leave.
Chitra, Chitra.
''You're my relief. You're my love.''
''My life's connected with yours.''
''l've your vivid memories.
lt makes me breathless''
''lt makes my eyes wet.''
l want to talk to you.
Yeah?
l agree that you are one
in a billion but me being me.
l tend to help everyone around me.
So why did you have
to misunderstand me?
Alright?
Alright.
l know you are very beautiful.
But that doesn't mean l have
fallen head over heels for you.
Understand?
Yes l do.
Any guy would like to
spend his entire life with you.
Mornings, evenings,
nights, then mornings again.
But l am not one of them.
l don't feel like that.
OK?
OK.
Ok. l have decided.
we won't meet from now on.
Then l guess you should
take this ring back.
You had left it in my balcony.
Enough of this drama.
''My heart says.''
''Don't every go away.''
''Let me touch your lips.''
''Let me dwell in your breath.''
''l'll die.
l will nevertolerate separation.''
''Forthe sake of love.''
''l've your vivid memories.
lt makes me breathless''
''lt makes my eyes wet.''
''Let me touch your lips.''
''Let me dwell in your breath.''
l want to ask you something?
But you have to promise
that you will tell me the truth.
Pure and crystal clear. 100% truth
What do you think of me?
Physically?
What do you think of my body?
Good.
Pretty good.
l feel that l am not attractive.
She won't like me.
RP, RP, Tell me the truth.
What?!
lf l work out for a few days,
visit the gym.
First l will tone my body like Salman.
And only then will l go and meet her.
l think its a good idea.
How much time will l require?
To become Chulbul Pandey?
Eight, ten days?
No, more than that.
Maybe a month. Minimum.
One month?
6 weeks for safety.
Where are you going?
You're my biggest well wisher.
if even you don't
have confidence in me?
You can't even meet my eyes.
Mandar.
Do you love her a lot?
More than myself.
Then my valiant leader.
Meet hertoday at 4pm.
l am sure her heart will
turn into rose milkshake.
Good god!
Go get her a gift.
And wear something smart.
l'll become like Salman by 4pm?
''Are you my sky?''
Hello. Nandini?
''Or are you my God?''
''Everywhere l look.''
''lt's just you.''
''Not just my world.
But, l've lost my life too.''
''You're my faith.''
''lt's just you.''
''Delicate dreams.
That's what this closeness was.''
''They just shattered.''
''Leaves in the sun.
Like the candle flame.''
''l kept burning. And just faded.''
''Are you my sky? Or are you my God?''
''Everywhere l look. lt's just you.''
''Not just my world.
But, l've lost my life too.''
''You're my faith. lt's just you.''
Are these tears for me?
That's ok.
RP l met Nandini as you said.
Really.
Yes.
And l think Nandini and me.
All thanks to you.
All thanks to me?
Yes.A miracle. l reached
there and Nandini had broken up!
Who breaks up on the phone?
l think that douchebag
crossed all his limits.
Was she alright?
She had collapsed completely.
Really?
l have never seen anyone
cry so much in their life.
Then what happened?
We spoke quite a bit and
then l even tried that position.
Position?
That love position!
Love position!
Profile test.
She didn't show me her profile
even once. lt's science. She loves me.
Did she say that?
Not yet.
Here she is.
My Nandini.
l am screwed!
Why did you call her here?
To introduce you two. Come!
Come on.
RP, this is my friend Nandini.
Nandini this is RP, my guardian angel.
Hi.
Hi.
RP found you.
Just for me.
Oh so all this wasn't
just a coincidence.
Mandar your VlP pass
is at the box office.
Be right there.
You guys just..One minute.
Mandarwait.
You are a very natural actor.
l told you.
l am an actor.
Enjoy the show.
lt's the best seat.
You can see everything
clearly from there.
l wish l had seen
everything clearly before.
''My dreams were shattered.''
What happened?
l don't know.Go see, find out.
Nandini!
Nandini!
Nandini What is it?
Did l say something wrong?
''Just one faith, one love.
You're that one for me.''
''Fall in love once.
Fall deeply in love just once.''
''Just one faith, one love.
You're that one for me.''
''The heart's so naive. lt
thinks the heart's its destination.''
''Now, loneliness is my companion.''
''The heart's so naive. lt
thinks the heart's its destination.''
Seete! lt is impossible for
you to free yourself from my clutches!
You are caught in my web now!
''Now, loneliness is my companion.''
''Fall in love once.
Fall deeply in love just once.''
Mandar!
Mandar!
''Fall in love once.
Fall deeply in love just once.''
Mandar!
''Fall in love once.
Fall deeply in love just once.''
You nit-wit,
pumpkin head, stinky shoe..
..damp sock!
Hey! My car!
What are you doing to my car?
Whoops, it's not RP's. Sorry!
There's been a little scratch on it.
l'll show you what a scratch
is you idiot!Wait there!
So, this was my 3 month long Dramayan.
What happened to Mandar?
He changed his contact details.
His ajji told me he doesn't
want to stay in touch with me.
And your show?
Must go on.
Chandra sir has found a new Ram.
Nandini?
ln these 3 months yourfiancee,
your love, and your.
Bff.
Right. Bff. You broke up with all 3?
And became a real life Raavan.
You know,
these 3 will neverforgive me.
Sorry.
Hey? Prescribe some medicines?
Any advice?
Say sorry. Ask forgiveness
from them whenever you meet them.
And before that,
apologize to yourself..
Learn to meet your own eyes.
Sometimes in life, a sorry is enough.
Hey RP Police arrested
our Hanuman yesterday.
What?!
Yes.
He forgot to take off his costume,
and rode his bike.
People at the signal were freaked out.
And you are telling me this now?
How are we going
to perform without him?
Don't worry RP.
l have already asked one
of our actors to stand in for him.
Who?
So? All set?
Thank you Chandra Sir. l had
a bit of a fever, but l am fine now.
Good to have you back!
Hi.
l need to get ready.
Will be right back.
Mandar l wanted to do something
else and it turned out to,
be something different altogether.
lt.it just happened.
My intentions were quite clean.
l'm sorry,
l know l hurt you in the process, but
l also fell in love,
and l'm not sorry forthat.
But it's good,
it's good that you've come back.
And we're talking about
it like civil,mature individuals.
The time to talk has passed.
it's time for some action.
Do you know why l
love theatre so much?
lt's so unpredictable!
Anything can happen to anyone.
At anytime!
So take care.
Brother.
Long live Sri Ram!
Seete! lt is impossible for
you to free yourself from my clutches!
You.
You?
You.
You are completely under my control.
You are caught in my web.
l agree. You posed
as a saint and came to me.
You made me cross my boundary.
You kidnapped me!
l didn't intend to
put you in this situation.
What kind of a man are you? Aren't
you ashamed to cover your guilt?
lt is entirely yourfault!
lt's Ram's fault.
Vikas?
Your Ram crossed the line first.
He neverthought about
the consequences of his actions.
He is your real culprit.
He isn't worthy of you Nandini.
Forget him!
Do you think he will
be able to forget me?
Never.
And your mere memory will
serve as a punishment for him.
Every moment away from
you will be a torture for him.
l just received a symbol of
Lord Ram's affection from Hanuman.
What do you think?
You are the only one
capable of laying a trap.
l don't see a trap anywhere.
You are still alone.
l am never alone.
He is always here.
ln front of me.
lt seems you know Ram
betterthan he knows himself.
l know this much.
That Lord Ram cannot watch
people in pain and distress.
He always strives to make them happy.
He wishes only the best forthem.
That is what l love most about him.
l know that whateverthe distance
between us, l will never be alone.
And he will never
be complete without me.
Our love story will
be remembered forever.
''Are you my sky? Or are you my God?''
''Everywhere l look. lt's just you.''
l saw this last week,
wasn't this different?
Seems that these two are doing
their real life drama on stage.
This is an international conspiracy!
This is Made in China Ramayan!
l nevertold you this,
but l love you so much.
And l love my Ram.
Did you hearthat?
l can hear nothing
but your heartbeats.
Corny! You have become
quite the drama queen!
