NETFLIX PRESENTS
Stop! Militia!
Hey!
Hey!
Tell him to make it louder.
What?
Tell him to make it loud.
Turn the sound up.
CITIZENS' MILITIA
Get him booked.
- What?
- What do you think, idiot?
Yes, sir. Sorry.
- My office. Both of you.
- All right.
He wants to see us.
- You, book him.
- Yes, sir.
- They make you sign something?
- Just this form letter.
- What's all this about?
- Hyacinth, I guess.
- What's Hyacinth?
- They're just writing up the queers.
Ah.
I want you on the Gregorczyk case.
What about the Pewex case?
That was good work.
Kind that leads to promotion.
When the SB steps in,
I don't ask questions.
It's not promotion time yet.
Why does SB want a thief?
Search me.
Homicide.
You need a guy with experience.
Mmm. Not experience.
I need a guy I can trust.
That's why I'm putting you on it, Nogaś.
Well...
Robert can't stand the sight of blood.
Shut up. Ass.
Don't piss me off, Nogaś.
This Gregorczyk guy was well-to-do.
They found him in the park.
Put someone away for it, and quickly.
This is a merit bonus.
VOUCHER, 220 ZLOTYS
- Is he in?
- Yeah.
So, we caught the Pewex case?
Looks like.
He's small-time.
Let us take down the whole ring.
The ministry has a job to do.
And so do you.
Sergeant.
Don't fight it, man.
It's a losing battle.
Okay. Here we are.
Jeez. You keep yanking that stick shift
like it's a dick or something.
It's shitty.
Go buy a new one, all right? The keys.
I'll take upstairs.
FILES
All clear upstairs.
That could be evidence.
I'm checking it out.
Something homemade?
Secure this.
Looks like we got some Hyacinth stuff.
Mm-hmm.
MASKS
- Hey.
- Hey.
Here's your mail.
When did it arrive?
Just today.
Aren't you gonna open it?
"This is to inform you
that Sergeant Robert Mrozowski
has been accepted
into the officers' academy."
Yes!
What a shame!
What a shame! Congratulations.
- Aren't you glad?
- I'm glad if you're glad.
Congratulations.
How did you know?
I know everything.
Hello, darling.
Hi.
They'll make a man out of you, son.
- I thought I was a man.
- Always room for improvement.
- Here you go.
- I got a murder case.
At the vic's house, we found a video with...
a video with men.
The Hyacinth files could come in handy.
Ah, thank you.
You're welcome.
They'll come in handy for other things.
Enough shop talk. Do you mind?
Militia! Open the door!
Irena, he won't be long. It's all right.
He can stay until 10:00, no later.
Where did you get this?
That's our wedding gift from my father.
Technical has the same one.
- Do they have tapes too?
- I do.
I got a tape you wouldn't wanna see.
Is that right?
Explain yourself.
This is great!
Thanks, Dad.
Who told you that?
It's obvious.
My father got this for us.
So should I throw it out?
No.
Wait a second.
Let me help you.
Don't forget the time!
The old lady will have a heart attack.
Shoulder dislocated, broken fingers,
facial contusions...
He either got really drunk
or he died fighting for his life,
like... like Bruce Lee.
What's the cause of death?
There.
He was stabbed several times,
once in the heart.
Found him in the park near the Mushroom.
You know what that means.
Yeah, we know he was a queer.
I live close by.
I've seen my share of them.
A while back, I had a similar case.
House is clean. No witnesses.
He had no family in the region.
We're gonna have to ask questions.
All right.
Robert goes in first.
See if anybody's around.
No sense taking chances.
If we can't get a win out of this...
Back-up, two units on the radio.
We nab some guys, bring 'em in,
and if one of 'em gets roughed up
a little bit, that's all right.
One fucking thing.
Make sure they can still talk.
We need to get information on Gregorczyk.
What about guns? Can we shoot?
I could shoot you. Yeah.
He get sucked into a black hole?
- Units one and two, we're moving in.
- Copy that.
Let's go!
Hold it!
Stop it right there! Stop!
- This way! Come on!
- What's his problem?
I got two
running on the avenue.
Trying to cut them off
at the next corner.
Come on!
Hide!
Let's check here.
They're raiding our spots, those bastards.
Well, sure they are. Like always, right?
Lately, they've been going crazy.
Saw a couple of them
head that way, but they're gone.
- What do you mean, gone?
- They disappeared.
There's a million alleys.
Could be anywhere by now.
I heard one guy
got stabbed to death.
Who did?
They called it off.
Let's go. Come on.
Did you see those idiots?
I'd be embarrassed to get caught by them.
If that's the best they got,
I guess we'll be okay.
Yeah, no.
They're not all like that.
What do you know about it?
- Huh?
- I'm just teasing.
- You go there a lot?
- That was my first time.
So you having fun yet?
To your first time.
Drink up.
I got an exam tomorrow. I gotta go easy.
- On what?
- Hegel.
I major in German studies.
And yourself?
You in school? You work?
I help out some.
I studied social rehabilitation in Kraków.
I just moved to the area.
- I've been helping out some kids.
- Troubled youth?
Yeah.
You should help me out then.
Arek.
Robert.
That bastard.
Did you get lost?
I had three units looking for you.
- I had to chase a guy down.
- Where is he? He got away?
No. Nobody got away.
But we have an informant now.
Dad'll be proud, right?
Let's do this.
First name?
Paweł.
- Last name?
- Młynarczyk.
Had some reason to go in the Mushroom?
I had to take a piss.
I mean, I went into the bathroom.
It was...
It's the only public toilet for miles.
Where am I supposed to go?
Mm-hmm.
Ever seen this guy before?
Mmm, never. Don't know the man.
Take a good look.
Told you I don't know the guy.
You want me to lie?
I don't know the guy.
Okay, in here.
Tell me, you like to fuck?
N-no. This is the first time it happened.
I went there by accident.
I-It's never gonna happen again.
I promise you that.
You know this guy?
No.
Gregorczyk.
N-no, I... I never heard that name.
I swear. Please don't let this get around.
I mean, I'm begging you, comrade.
I'll be on my ass, you know.
What were you in the Mushroom for?
Why does anyone go
in the Mushroom? It's a public toilet.
Any kids?
Yes, sir, I do.
- And your kids know?
- The shop foreman, that's all I am.
You'll never get a job again.
I don't know any of them.
Then your life is over.
Your wife'll know about this.
So will your kids. So will your mommy.
Come on, please don't press charges.
I... I got a wife and kids, you know?
I got a family too!
I don't go fucking men up the butt.
Ever get a nightstick up your asshole?
How 'bout that?
That'll give you a reason to cry.
Now how did you know Gregorczyk, huh?
Thank you.
- Your name?
- Tad Morawski.
Nice to know you.
What kind of name is that? Tad?
It's Tadeusz.
You know a guy named Gregorczyk?
Know this face?
We have a file on you.
You have priors.
Want to screw up your whole life?
Here. Think it over.
You gonna let me go home?
You have to pony up.
He pays.
He employed some guys.
Where at?
I may have heard about a villa.
What exactly did you hear?
Just some rumors that get around.
Tell me, bitch,
you wanna get your legs busted up?
Get this fucking queer out of my sight.
Do they have brothels for queers?
Gregorczyk apparently was
hiring these male prostitutes.
I'll ask my contact.
Yeah. Okay, man. Do that.
How was the exam?
Come on.
What's the occasion?
Your exam is over.
Here. Cheers, then.
I got a problem.
I think one of my kids is selling himself.
If you go cruising,
you can always find a kid who needs cash.
Yeah, but there are stringers, right?
Who deliver the boys.
You don't think that I...
No. Of course not.
I just thought you might know something.
Forget I asked.
I heard about a taxi driver downtown.
Julian.
Only a rumor, but...
Thanks. I'll ask around.
There's a party at my place Saturday.
- Swing by.
- Sure.
Kwiatowa 34, apartment six.
Gentlemen, where to?
Julian Piwek?
Mmm?
Adam Gregorczyk. Know him?
Nobody shows me their ID.
Ever seen the guy?
Never.
Fuck! Wanna chat here, or would you rather
speak to us down at the station?
- Officer, come on.
- You brought him boys, right?
Who? I did?
We booked him this month for prostitution.
I don't know. Seriously, I can't recall.
You know one of them, that's for sure.
- Mm-mmm.
- Better look at them.
Oh!
Uh, yeah, that guy. Yeah.
I might have driven him.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I think so.
We'll talk again.
So, should we arrest this guy?
Not if he plays nice.
Open up!
Oh, good evening.
- We're here to see Kamil Barczyk.
- Yes, but he's not home.
We'll see for ourselves.
Nothing.
- Hey! Shit. Fuck. Hey!
- Excuse me.
- Okay.
- Pretty good shape.
You went to see Gregorczyk.
So what? So did everybody on the street.
Go bother the other guys.
Fine. Give us all their names.
I didn't even...
You...
You can't put me in prison.
Prostitution,
assault and battery,
destruction of public property.
You put a dent in my car.
I'm gay, so I'm guilty.
Because you need somebody
to hang for the murder of Greg.
Adrian got stabbed by a psycho,
but you guys did fuck-all.
Get rid of all the queers.
Yes, convenient.
So who's Adrian?
Suck my dick.
Be polite. Give us his last name.
Adrian Sobolew.
So he's dead?
He got knifed to death.
How do you know?
Maybe you're the one who stabbed him.
No, I swear,
I'm not the one who stabbed him.
Then why run from us?
I thought it was them, not the police.
Who's them?
Adrian was supposed to give
some money to Gregorczyk.
- For sex?
- No.
Some pictures he had.
How do you know this?
- No, I can't tell you.
- Who was it who took them?
We should maybe talk to this this Sobolew.
Go ahead.
Yeah, go ahead.
In the meantime,
me and this queer can have a talk.
- Hi. How are you?
- I got a question.
I already said yes.
To what?
I said I would marry you, you asshole.
All right. Yeah.
Can you show me a case file?
What case?
A homicide. Adrian Sobolew.
Sure. I'll pull it for you.
Don't forget you owe me.
Love you, babe.
I know you do!
Hey.
Look.
Fucker bit me.
But he confessed.
Confessed to what?
Whatever we want.
I think could work like this.
What does a millionaire
have in common with a junkie?
Besides the place of death?
CASE FILE
ADRIAN SOBOLEW HOMICIDE
Okay, since you're so smart,
where would you take it from here?
You got a witness. I'm sure you'll manage.
Hmm.
Guard!
Help! Get help!
A knife. Cut him down.
A knife! Go!
The case has been closed.
Not completely clean,
but we basically cleared it.
What do you mean, cleared?
The taxi driver said
that this dead guy knew Gregorczyk,
that he went to see him.
He also admitted
that he knew Adrian Sobolew.
We obtained his confession
for the murder of Gregorczyk.
He'd have confessed
to murdering the pope after that beating.
Thank you for solving this
so expeditiously.
You both did good work.
Get back to it.
Wait a second. Chief, the Sobolew
and Kamil cases are similar.
- We could maybe look into that.
- What for?
Just to make sure.
Mr. Mrozowski, you must learn
to savor small victories.
- We have no evidence.
- We have better.
We've obtained a confession.
You want to interrogate a dead man?
- Someone was in that cell.
- The guard said nobody went in.
- He wasn't even around.
- He stepped out to the bathroom.
You're going
to the officers' academy soon.
Drop this shit already.
Take a week to focus on your wedding.
- Yes, good morning.
- Morning.
Uh, I'm here about Kamil. Uh...
Ah, Kamil. I'm afraid
he isn't home anymore.
Ah, would you like to come in?
Yes, a little while ago,
there... there was a guy here.
- A guy? He's militia?
- I'm not sure.
He just threw things around
and then he left.
You see, but Kamil was gone.
He'd left by then.
And it's a good thing.
Come on. Do come in.
I'll make you a cup of tea.
Same thing happened during the war.
They came for Franek
in the middle of the night.
I don't even know who it was,
who took him.
That was years ago,
and nothing has changed in my time.
You'd think that people would wise up.
All the problems, all the time.
I say just keep your head down
and steer clear if you can.
Sugar?
Do you take sugar?
Yes, please.
Anyway, a good cup of tea...
I'm sure that you can understand.
Not a good time.
Hang on a second.
- Isn't he your son?
- Yes.
Robert.
Ah, there's a resemblance.
I really must go.
SURVEILLANCE FILE
KAMIL BARCZYK
So what's wrong?
Listen, that suicide case is really...
That case has been cleared.
Dad, look, I've been...
First, don't call me "Dad."
Call me "colonel."
Second, if your superior officer
tells you something is closed,
that means you drop it. Dismissed.

Password?
I'm just joking. Come on in.
Pretzel?
- Is Arek here?
- No.
But I am.
Arek.
Chill out. He'll be here.
Come on, come on.
House special, right here.
Take this rag off. You'll be hot soon.
Here you go.
Anyway...
Hey! Leave that alone!
It's his mother's favorite dress!
The queen of Poland
has summoned you to the ball.
Cold outside! Cold as the Cold War.
Who's this, now?
Robert.
Robert. Hi.
Hey, girl.
For the last three weeks,
I've gotten two out of each of these jars.
For the last three weeks!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Darek is Dariusz,
but Marek isn't Mariusz.
Famous Tad delicacy.
Flaming hot sausages.
Oh, my goodness.
Yes, that Tad, truly a wizard.
- Trying to burn the house down?
- Naturally.
The party is here!
- Uh, hold this.
- Mm-hmm.
- I heard there's a party here.
- So they say.
Mind if I come in?
Sure, yeah. Come on in.
Hi. Look what I got.
Turns out
it's that Gregorczyk guy.
I warned you.
So what now?
I don't know.
We'll just be careful.
And that villa?
Listen, Tum-Tums, this thing
has nothing to do with the villa.
Yeah. Keep telling yourself that.
Maciuś, it's not your problem.
It's everyone's problem.
No. It's not your problem. That's all.
It's as simple as that.
I hear you're from Kraków.
Because I've been to Kraków.
Hey. Just beat it, okay?
Lola!
Lola! Lola! Lola! Lola! Lola!
Arek, Arek!
Hey! Go, go, go!
- You got him now!
- You got him!
Drink, drink!
Let's go skiing!
Time to ski,
time to ski, time to ski!
- Okay. Give me it.
- Olé!
Yeah?
Want to borrow it?
You had it right.
He's one of us.
I knew I'd seen this face.
Maybe at the university.
He's one of the lecturers.
Nice party.
Hmm.
Might be the last of its kind.
They've been sweeping us up, arresting us.
- Soon they'll ban us from meeting up.
- Well, can't be that serious.
Poles don't like Poles
to be any happier than them.
In fact, they hate it.
Tad,
you better stop fooling around,
or else you'll get AIDS,
and even I won't be able to help you.
Should I stay home
like the rest of you old poofs?
At least they closed
that brothel. Less temptation.
Your mind is a brothel.
Ooh, keep an eye on him.
Yeah, I gotta go.
Stay.
Some kids to see in the morning.
Sure. So, another time.
Robert?
Come back. That'll give you an excuse.

UNIVERSITY, SCHEDULE
Sergeant Robert Mrozowski.
What do you want?
Where was this taken?
I told you everything I know.
Told who?
Why won't you guys leave me alone?
I could show
these graphic pictures to everybody.
Your students. The rector.
Who sent you to me, anyway?
I signed what you wanted.
The deal was you would leave me alone.
Robert Mrozowski.
Next time I speak to your superiors,
I'll speak very well of you.
Of your curious nature.
If you'll excuse me,
my soup's getting cold.
We got married in August.
They say months with an A bring good luck.
Well, I'm not superstitious.
Did you pick out a wedding dress?
Robert bought fabric.
I need to take it to the dressmaker.
- Robert?
- Mm-hmm.
Hey.
Maybe I could
buy something new for myself,
or even order something custom-made.
Ed, put that out.
Well, what do you say, Robert?
Will you be an honest man?
He's the best officer I know.
Hmm.
Yeah, well, "the best."
What does that mean?
If he knows how to keep his nose clean,
he could have a career.
His work is
above and beyond the call of duty.
You should just do
what's required and nothing more.
Which is to say?
Please, you're not alone here, gentlemen.
Stay out of this, all right?
You're not at the precinct, Ed.
Oh, wait a second.
Here.
With this, you won't ever miss
a single important memory.
Thank you.
Thank you so much. May I?
Of course. Enjoy.
Oh, this is too much.
The latest model.
Hmm?
Darling.
Are you okay?
- Do you think your folks still do it?
- Jesus!
Stop it.
What?
It's just that your dad
is always so uptight.
True.
Take mine now.
Robert!
Why are you so nervous?
- What am I supposed to say?
- Just be honest.
If he finds out my dad's SB,
he'll kick us out.
Half of Poland has
something they wanna hide.
- Bless you, Father.
- God bless. Are you on your way inside?
We want to get married,
but we have a small problem.
His father is secret police.
You understand.
You're only responsible
for what you do yourself.
We're both militia officers.
That doesn't matter.
It's your faith in God.
That really matters.
As I live and breathe.
- And what are you doing here?
- Looking for a place to rest.
- What'll you have?
- Some tea.
Vodka.
I remember where I saw you.
- Party at Arek's.
- Mmm.
My memory's good.
I'm going.
- Where?
- Hey, man,
city needs a hero.
Later.
Brother?
No one told me.
What are you gonna do
after you graduate?
I don't know.
I can't think that far ahead.
Make a plan, or others will do it for you.
Don't be such a wet blanket.
- Keep a lookout.
- Yeah. I got your back.
- What the hell?
- Come on. Let's go.
Are you insane? Defacement of property.
- It's all in the plans.
- You fucking idiot!
Are you looking to get in trouble?
Can't always be running scared.
You can't be scared of liberty.
Hey.
What's this?
Robert.
Please, someone could come in.
Robert...
Robert!
What's going on?
Nothing. I'm just in love with you, okay?
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Come on, out of the file room.
Close the door.
What is this?
- They closed the murders with no evidence.
- So?
That always happens.
You were supposed to return these.
You could get me fired.
No one's getting fired.
Once in a while, think about me.
I do.
No, you don't.
You only think of them.
You always leave the wedding plans to me.
Robert, does marriage scare you?
I'll drive you over
to get the dress, all right?
Do you think
I need someone to drive me around?
Robert, this has to be a partnership.
You're right.
I'm not the driver.
- What?
- I'm not only a driver.
We have to leave. Come on.
Where to?
- Take me to the villa.
- What villa?
You drove this guy?
Nah, that'll be the end of me.
I can't. Sorry.
They do whatever they want.
So do I.
Go.
Wait here.
Get rid of everything here.
Strip the walls, caulk up the holes,
and then paint it plain white.
And don't breathe a word of this...
or there'll be trouble.
You can start with this wall here.
- What's next?
- Keep your mouth shut.
Follow him.
Follow him!
And now what?
Back up! Back up! Back up!
Arek.
I have to talk to Tad.
He mentioned a villa.
What is it?
Tad's in the hospital.
What bastard did this to him?
You have to ask? Pigs.
Police stabbed Tad?
Is that so strange?
Motherfuckers.
I'm sorry. You can't stay.
I'll sit outside the hospital and wait.
There's nothing to wait for tonight.
Go have a drink in his honor.
Come on.
- Where was he found?
- No idea.
- Who found him?
- Arek.
Hurry up.
Let's go wait outside.
- What can I get you?
- A bottle of your purest substance.
We need to leave this place.
Go where?
Anywhere else.
Change will never come here.
Here's to Tad.
Want another one?
Yeah. Pour.
What the hell?
You win. You get the couch.
Yeah? Hey, hey!
Everything all right?
Did something happen?
Not yet, but it will.
The commander has
recommended awards for you and Wojtek.
Of course, I put in a word for you.
That so?
For the way
you solved the Gregorczyk case.
Solved it? Huh.
Job well done.
DIPLOMA
They sent you to do it?
You told my wife.
It's over for me, anyway.
This is personal.
Take a seat.
Who ordered the murders?
Security Service?
You've been working for them?
CLASSIFIED
I recruited some boys for them.
At the university.
I was blackmailed.
I didn't think it would come to this.
I'm sick about it.
Excuse me for just a second.
Oh, my God!
Somebody get help. Call the police!
Shut the door.
You were behind this.
- This what?
- Everything.
You fucking had me tailed?
Was it a mistake to?
Wanna play around with homos?
Go right ahead.
You know what to do.
Your last name.
Krajewski.
Arkadiusz.
Profession.
Student.
Are you in the habit
of frequenting homosexuals?
Do you correspond
with homosexuals from other countries?
No.
And how many partners
have you had sexually?
Only one lately.
Tell me the first and last name
of your most recent sexual partner.
Can't remember.
Techniques and positions used
during your sexual encounters.
You take pleasure in this?
Sign this.
HOMOSEXUAL ID FILE
- I said sign it.
- No.
You practice prostitution.
- Never. That's not me.
- We have evidence.
Who else was in that villa?
Give us all their details
and we'll let you go.
We'll wipe the slate clean. Come on.
- Look, nobody showed their ID.
- Really?
Then how do you know Gregorczyk?
The men in that villa.
I want their names, now.
Who were they?
I don't know...
- Names, you son of a whore!
- Enough!
I'll say when it's enough.
- He's innocent.
- Innocent?
He made a queer of my son.
Get out.
Get the hell out.
This matter has now been settled.
Okay. Now I'm done.
Arek!
- Arek!
- Better get tested.
You might've caught sick.
- Excuse me, boys.
- Halinka, I'm worried about him.
Who's that man?
Set me up because of that case.
Would you just tell me the truth for once?
Don't I deserve that much?
You won't look at me.
I was working late.
- Stop. Enough.
- Well, what can I tell you?
The truth.
That's all. For once in your life.
I'm in love with her.
What kind of joke is that?
I have to pick up a few things.
Yes, sir.
PERSONAL FILE
SC RINGLEADER
- Hello?
- Is Arek there?
Arek is with Tad.
- You mean at the hospital?
- I don't know.
He said he was going to see Tad.
- You lied to me!
- You lied to me!
- You went to that villa.
- Robert, enough.
Tad is dead.
See? They're hitting every single one.
Anyone who was in that villa.
- You gotta get out of here.
- I don't like being bossed around.
You seem to enjoy it, though.
For once, just listen.
You better leave.
I'm so sorry.
What for?
I lied. I lied to everyone.
Except yourself.
- Thank you for your service.
- Thank you, sir.
CITIZENS' MILITIA
FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE
Congratulations.
Well done.
I'm getting chills.
I guess.
Keep up the good work.
Congratulations.
I watched the tape.
I truly commend your attitude.
Glad we have
such dedicated officers in the service.
We will thoroughly be
keeping an eye on your career.
Here's your medal.
Congratulations, one and all.
Now, let's all relax
and enjoy some refreshments
and, of course, a little dancing.
Music!
- For you.
- Thanks.
Not here! We're in public.
- Let's dance.
- I don't know how.
Just follow me.
That for me?
Wanna dance?
Please, let me explain.
You don't have to.
I have to go.
I know.
Can my son be kept out of danger?
I beg you.
Of course.
He's your responsibility.
Yours personally.
The car keys.
- What's going on?
- Just give me the keys.
Did something happen?
- Need some help?
- I have to do this alone.
Don't do anything stupid!
Arek. Arek.
We have to get out of here.
They know you're here.
Just trust me, all right?
Come on!
You're all right.
Go hide.
Run.
What?
Run away.
Together?
You come with me.
Hey.
I'll find you later. Now, just run.
Go.
In 1985-1987,
as part of Operation "HYACINTH,"
thousands of LGBT community members
were surveilled, detained and questioned.
Over 11,000 "pink files" were created
and used to blackmail
and pressure homosexuals.
To this day, most of the files
have not been recovered.
