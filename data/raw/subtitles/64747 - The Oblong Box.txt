Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Edward!
Oh, my God!
Edward!
Edward.
Go back!
Edward, no!
You leave me no choice. Ruddock.
- Edward!
- Don't do it!
Edward! Please, control yourself.
Down here, on the bed!
Stop!
Get them.
- I'm asking you.
- I don't know.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.
I don't know what you and him are up to,
but you've got to get him out of here.
- You're being paid.
- And paid well.
Barely well enough.
If the police come, what's the answer?
You've nothing to fear, Hackett.
You're running a lodging house
for drunken thieves and whores.
It's that filthy stench.
What's he doing in there?
- That's what I want to know.
- That's enough! About your business!
Anyway, he'll be gone soon enough.
The sooner the better, if you ask me.
- It's not ready to be seen as yet.
- But it will be by tonight?
Yes. Have you brought the money?
- Gold?
- Guineas.
But not till your work is done.
When it is, you can take this
back to Africa with you...
on the same boat that brought you here.
You'll be a rich man, N'Galo.
That's what you want.
Do you think it will work?
When he takes this,
he will sleep as if dead.
Look...
even if we do get Sir Edward here...
can he really help him?
I have seen what witchcraft can do.
Believe me, Norton.
You have seen what another man
of my powers has done already.
Have you not?
Yes.
We have knowledge of things
you know nothing of.
I've been thinking it over, Julian.
And I've decided that I want to
get married at sea on an open boat.
Yes.
In a brilliant scarlet dress to amuse
all the sailors and shock my father.
What? I'm sorry Elizabeth.
I was miles away.
So I noticed.
Back in Africa?
Why do you think that?
I would have thought it was obvious.
Since you've been home
you're a totally different person.
- No, that's nonsense.
- No, it isn't.
Look at you.
Always brooding, heavy-spirited.
Half the time you seem to forget
you're with me and we're going to get...
Elizabeth, dear, I am sorry, truly.
What happened out there?
What's on your mind all the time?
Please tell me.
No. It's not worth your worrying about.
When we're married, Julian,
I want to share your life.
Don't let's start out with secrets, please.
Let me start sharing now.
I may have things on my mind,
but that doesn't mean that I've changed.
Then prove it.
I didn't really mean that.
I meant...
I'd like to see you smiling
the way you used to smile.
There!
Yes, it's your usual
good report, Trench.
- Thorough and precise.
- I'm more than pleased to be back.
- Africa is a heathen place, and no mistake.
- Yes.
Thank you.
Yes, we've had
a distasteful time of it here, too.
Properly handled, your African plantation
could keep you living well...
to the end of your God-given days.
You and your brother.
We mustn't forget Sir Edward, must we?
Sir Edward wouldn't eat
any of his dinner, sir.
Thank you, Ruddock, I'll try later.
How is Sir Edward now?
How did you expect him to be? Better?
I had hoped more normal.
Yes, he did seem to be more normal...
so we took off the chains.
But the madness only overcame him again.
He tried to break away, to escape.
Ever since then
he seems to have grown steadily worse.
Every man wants to be free.
How can he be free,
looking the way he does?
Don't you understand
his mind is going, too?
Sometimes that sickness strikes him
with such ferocity...
he's as dangerous as an insane beast.
Perhaps an asylum?
No.
We mustn't even think about that.
I couldn't bear the thought of my brother
screaming his life away...
in Bedlam with the rest
of those unfortunate creatures.
And surgery is out of the question?
Do you think those carrion doctors
could put his face together again?
Do you think they could even
lay hands on him...
without wanting to experiment? No.
I'd like to see him.
I don't allow anyone
to see him but myself.
- He's much too dangerous.
- I'm not afraid.
He seemed so pleased
to see me the last time.
Yes, he did seem to be better
for a while after you saw him.
Very well, you may go up.
But please,
don't let him see you're shocked...
by how much worse he has become.
And don't get too close.
Remember, if the madness
comes over him again...
your only protection
are the chains on his feet.
- Thank you, I'll remember.
- Ruddock.
Take Mr. Trench to see Sir Edward.
- I'd keep my distance, sir.
- It'll be all right, Ruddock.
Sir Edward?
Sir Edward. It's me, Trench.
There isn't much time.
I just want you to know
that I've come back from Africa.
- Have you done what I asked?
- Yes.
When will it be?
In two days. It'll be ready.
You will be well rewarded.
Unless you fail.
I must get out of here, Trench.
I'm counting on you. Before it's too late.
It's as I feared. You've upset him.
I'm afraid I can't allow anyone
to see him again ever.
Good night.
Look!
What happened?
Body snatchers, Master Julian.
They got away.
The doctors still require
their warm guinea pigs.
You're not shocked?
It's better that they practice their
barbarities on the dead than on the living.
- They pay a handsome price, I suppose.
- Of course.
And for some of our people,
that kind of money is the difference...
- between a full belly and an empty one.
- You're not shocked?
I can see how important
it is for the poor souls.
Better than a good mark in heaven.
It is for God to judge, Parson,
and not you.
It's horrifying, Julian.
Far worse things
are known to man, Elizabeth.
I'm going to put it all out of my mind.
The only thing to think about is us.
- Are we still getting married soon?
- Sooner.
Because Father may succeed
in driving me off to Italy, away from you.
- But I thought we had his blessing.
- That was before.
Before?
Before you returned
from the dark continent.
Before you dismissed
most of the servants.
Before the town started to talk.
You mean they're talking about me?
About the house?
Don't you see what a hermit
you're becoming? Of course they talk.
Wild tales of demons
and ghosties with rattling chains.
But you don't believe
any of that nonsense, do you?
There's nothing to believe, is there?
- What do you think?
- I think they're all madmen, fools.
Good.
For the master.
- From Mistress Elizabeth, Master.
- Thank you, Ruddock.
Have you taken up
Sir Edward's dinner yet?
No, sir, I'll take it up right away.
"Dearest Julian, I am no longer able to fight
my father's wishes to send me to Italy."
"He is disturbed
by your strange behavior..."
"and wants to be sure
that I do not make a mistake."
"You must know that it is not my wish
to leave you and end our betrothal."
Master Julian!
Sir! It's Sir Edward!
What is it, Ruddock?
You'd better come, Sir.
Edward, why did they have to take you?
Can your soul ever forgive mine?
Ruddock...
bring Trench to me.
And no one else is to know.
Very well, Sir.
There's Trench now.
- My brother Edward has died.
- I'm so sorry to hear that.
There's no need for sorrow.
In his case oblivion
was a merciful release.
- When is he going to be buried?
- As soon as you've found another body.
I don't understand.
It's been so long since there was
a funeral in this family, Trench.
You've forgotten.
The Markhams go to their grave
with a sense of occasion.
The villagers must pay their respects.
We must lie in state for the world to see.
But we wouldn't want the world to see
what Edward was really like.
So you want another body
for the villagers to look at?
Correct. Edward
is already in his coffin.
Once the town has gaped at the proxy
corpse, then we can bury the real one.
I won't be involved.
You've been involved with this family
most of your life, Trench.
Do you realize the penalty
for body snatching is hanging?
- It's the same penalty as for forgery.
- What?
I said forgery.
With these papers you have managed...
to extract 1,000 guineas
from our plantations, is that not so?
I'm a lawyer, not a businessman.
You're a forger and an embezzler...
and now you're going to become
a body snatcher.
Not willingly, Julian.
They say the deeper you get,
the easier it becomes.
- How long have you known about this?
- I've suspected for some time.
But now I know.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to give you
another 1,000 guineas...
or turn you over to the authorities.
Very well, Sir Julian.
Your brother shall have the traditional,
dignified funeral.
Just give me enough time
to find a body for him...
that won't disgrace your noble line.
Will you join me in a brandy?
Thank you.
Have you brought the money?
- Well?
- I was sent for.
- It happened?
- Yes.
When do we let ourselves into the house
to rescue Sir Edward?
We don't. Not now.
Why not?
Because, my dear Mark,
Sir Edward is already nailed in a coffin.
What?
And securely locked behind a door
to which we do not have a key.
I don't understand.
There are, however,
still opportunities for making money.
How?
Julian doesn't want anyone to see
his brother looking the way he does now.
He wants another body
to show the townspeople.
That's madness!
Madness or not, we are going to
provide him with another body.
We haven't got to do anything.
At least, I haven't.
My God, Trench, have you forgotten
Sir Edward alive in that coffin?
Control yourself, Mark.
I've already told you,
there's nothing we can do about that.
Julian is offering 1,000 guineas
for a dead body.
And that's what we're going to do,
give him one.
So how do we get it? Answer me that.
N'Galo, I feel, can help us further.
- Good. You know what to do?
- Aye, Doctor.
They put it in, we take it out.
As fast as that.
What about the last one you promised me?
We had a bit of trouble, but don't
worry yourself, this one will be warmer.
I've come to pay you.
Inside.
Yes. Here we are.
Well, go on.
Help yourself.
I think you'll find it's all there.
I'll get Mr. Hackett. I will.
- Mr. Hackett.
- I'm afraid he's busy.
- Not too busy to see me, love.
- Good evening, madam.
- Yes?
- Mr. Hackett, I'm afraid, is not too well.
- What is it this time?
- I fear he's had a little too much to drink.
I'm not surprised.
But I can assure you
that he'll be up presently.
Ruddock, tell your master
that Samuel Trench wishes to see him.
On a matter of the greatest importance.
This is Mark Norton.
- I told you to do it alone.
- I couldn't do it alone.
Hadn't you better get your prize inside?
Yes. Ruddock.
Since our return from Africa,
as you know...
my brother has been forced
to live in seclusion...
the victim of a tropical disease.
However, in his will, he has not
forgotten the village of his youth.
There is a substantial donation
to the church...
and generous bequest to the poor.
Our Father which art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name...
- 1,000 guineas and this.
- Blood money.
Hardly. The man was already dead.
- Tell me, what really did happen in Africa?
- What do you mean?
- Nothing. Only it is curious, isn't it?
- What is?
That no one's ever heard what Sir Edward
did to deserve such a terrible punishment.
Retribution.
That's just what I've come
to think it was.
- Retribution.
- God's vengeance.
You were never impressed
by the Christian myths before.
Sin and retribution.
We sinned out there
in Africa, all right.
Plundering their land,
and we're still stealing their wealth.
Though they're too innocent to know it.
Yes, Edward's fate
can only be our punishment...
our kind of retribution.
You're only making me more curious.
'...of whom may we seek
for succour, but of thee, O Lord...
'...who for our sins
art justly displeased?
'Yet, O Lord God most holy,
O Lord most mighty...
'...O holy and most merciful Saviour...
'...deliver us not into...'
Why did you never tell me?
I would have understood.
I couldn't be sure, Elizabeth.
I didn't know how to tell you.
Sending that letter to you.
I'm so sorry. So very sorry.
You're my last chance, Elizabeth,
for some peace, some happiness.
- You will stay, you will marry me?
- Of course I will, darling.
He has found some peace at last,
as he never could have on earth.
'...dear brother here departed...
'...we therefore commit
his body to the ground...
'...earth to earth...
'...ashes to ashes...
'...dust to dust.
'...in sure and certain hope
of Resurrection...'
- Poor Edward Markham.
- We'll open the house again.
It'll be like it once was.
We'll let the sun stream
in on a new life.
Help! Murder!
- Murder!
- Right, hold him.
Move yourself.
Come on.
Easy.
Come on.
Giddy-up now!
Move yourself, lads. Come on.
I thought you were
never going to get here.
These things take time and caution,
Doctor, as I'm sure you realize.
Yes.
- What have you got for me this time?
- Male. Just buried.
His name and where he comes from
is my business. You know that, too.
By the way, we've got something
extra special for you tonight.
- What do you mean?
- All right, bring it in. On the table.
Slightly damaged, I'm afraid.
We couldn't take one without the other,
if you see what I mean.
- You murdered him.
- Well, the law might call it that.
We ought to call it a lucky accident.
Lucky for you, because you've got
twice the stuff for your knives and needles.
Lucky for me and the boys
in the usual way.
Of course, you know...
you'd better never ever
so much as whisper about this, don't you?
Weller!
You would do well to realize
that you are in this as deeply as I am.
Remember that.
It's all in the course
of science, isn't it?
Why don't we spend the honeymoon
in Africa?
No.
A long time ago, when you first met me,
you said you loved the land out there.
But not any more, Elizabeth.
I never want to go back there again.
- Why?
- I've seen too much...
of what Africa can mean...
and what we have come to mean to Africa.
In fact, I...
Yes?
I've been thinking of abandoning
everything out there before it's too late.
What would that mean?
Well, it would mean that we'd still be
Sir Julian and Lady Elizabeth...
but there wouldn't be anything
to go with the title.
I see.
For years now, this family has been
nothing but an empty facade.
- And yet, still you'd abandon Africa?
- More than ever.
That's the only way we can find peace.
You'll make a splendid host, Doctor.
And I feel very much at home here.
- I'm obliged to you.
- And I'm obliged to you, Doctor.
Particularly as you're going to
give me shelter.
Are you suggesting that I should
hide you here in this house?
Why should I?
Your body snatchers seem to have
thrown you on the murder trail last night.
Would you like anyone
to know about that?
Anyway, the penalty for grave robbing
is the noose, isn't it?
And happily or not,
my body's alive enough to tell the tale.
Just who are you?
- Don't you know whose grave they robbed?
- I do not.
Empty graves eventually
tell their story.
You're mistaken.
They show no signs of having been opened.
So, you're the only one
who knows of my resurrection.
I couldn't have wished for better.
I'm in your good care now, Doctor.
Indeed. And for how long?
As long as need be.
I must stay hidden.
You're going to keep me
healthy as well...
until I've paid back
some very urgent debts.
Duke!
What have you found, Duke?
Come on, Duke!
The servants have returned.
Now that you've safely taken charge
of your remarkable cadaver...
What shall I say to them about you?
Tell them...
I'm a relative, badly burned abroad...
who prefers not to frighten people
with his scars.
Yes, I suppose that's reasonable.
- You really are a very fortunate man.
- Why do you say that?
You're looking at someone who must be
quite unique, even in your experience.
A man turned inside out
through sorcery...
by a handful of powders
and obscure drugs.
My mind's been unhinged,
my face destroyed.
I've been killed and then brought
miraculously back to life.
I am a very remarkable creature, Doctor.
And you are only concerned
with what the servants will think.
- One has to observe the conventions.
- Be done with it, and get out!
Lock me in here if you wish,
and don't worry about the servants.
I'll only do my prowling by night.
Poor fellow. I wonder who he was?
We'll find out.
This is Master Julian Kemp, Doctor.
He found the body.
- My dog did, actually.
- You uncovered a mystery, Master Kemp.
Whoever he is, he wasn't drowned.
He died, it seems,
from natural causes...
and either fell
or was pushed into the water.
Thank you.
Thank you, Sally.
A beautiful girl.
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- Merely a comment.
Perhaps you'd be good enough to tell me
how long you propose to stay here?
I've told you, Doctor.
Until I settle my debts.
I hope I'm not interfering
with your work.
In fact, I intend
to help you financially.
It must be just awful
to have your face so badly burned...
that you can't let it be seen.
I'm sorry for him.
- He sounds such a gentleman.
- Don't let your sympathy go too far.
- Mrs. Hopkins!
- You needn't Mrs. Hopkins me.
I know your dealings with the gentry,
Sally Baxter.
It's not faces you're interested in,
is it girl?
Well, Mark, everything's ready
exactly the way you asked for it.
A draft on the American Bank,
and the balance in gold.
Aren't you going to say thank you?
Thank you, Trench, for your worthless
promises and the blood on my hands.
You needed money. I helped you get it.
You didn't mention that getting it
meant murder!
You really are frightened, aren't you?
Yes.
My dear Mark, if Hackett's body is found,
there's nothing on it to prove his identity.
And what about Sir Edward? Buried alive.
An unfortunate accident.
I've forgotten the entire affair and
I suggest the sooner you do, the better.
I'm leaving England.
I wish to God
I'd never set eyes on you, Trench.
I pray to God I never shall again.
I think it's time for tea, Graves.
Don't you?
All right. To Dover.
Hey there, driver!
No need for knives, highwayman.
Not if you tell me
where the witch doctor is.
- Sir Edward.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
- Too late for lies now.
- I swear, I don't know.
- Then you are useless to me.
Good evening, Madam.
It's so nice to see
the house open again.
Yes, a change.
Very interesting.
- Sir Julian.
- I'm so pleased you could come.
Charmed.
Baron, I'm so pleased to see you.
Sir Julian. You've never looked better.
Time you were married.
Yes, I agree.
- Kemp.
- Julian.
Lovely to see you.
I'm so pleased you could come.
I want you to do a portrait
of my beautiful Elizabeth one day.
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
She looks radiant tonight.
- What is it?
- It's a man. A man in a crimson hood.
It must be a highwayman.
Ruddock!
Bring the other servants.
There's a prowler about.
- Right. Out in the garden and search.
- Right.
No, please, everyone don't leave.
Don't leave. Believe me,
there's nothing to worry about.
The servants will take care
of everything.
I want to drink a toast.
To my wife!
Lady Markham...
I see nothing but happiness
and comfort ahead.
More than enough for just two.
Please, now, let's dance.
To assist you in your experiments.
Good night, Doctor, and sleep well.
- Aren't you frightened?
- Why should I be?
Me, a stranger, hiding under a hood.
You don't know...
You little slut! You were with him
last night, weren't you?
- Well, what if I was?
- That man is dangerous.
That man's in pain.
You wouldn't feel sorry for a crippled dog.
- Have you seen his face?
- No.
But he's burned, isn't he?
Why should I be afraid of scars when I see
all the dead bodies that you handle?
It makes my skin crawl.
If that's all that's disturbing you,
you have nothing to worry about.
You're dismissed! You can go home.
I'm sure that with your abilities
you will find suitable lodgings...
and an appropriate position.
I'd need some money for that, Doctor.
I said, you'd have to make it worth my
while to leave such a wonderful position.
Otherwise the village will hear more
about your surgical research.
Very well.
But don't imagine that you're going to
indulge in a little blackmail...
or breathe a word about that man.
What if I do?
I might find myself buying
your pretty little body one day.
For a guinea or two.
- Where is Sally?
- She's gone.
Gone where?
Gone away.
Why? I wouldn't harm her.
You can say what you please,
but she's not coming back.
Remember this...
you need me, and without my help
you wouldn't last one minute.
I've read your reference, Sally, and I see
no reason why you shouldn't start at once.
- Thank you, milady.
- Sally, why did you leave Dr. Neuhartt?
A relative came to stay.
There was no room for me.
If you do your work satisfactorily here,
I think you'll find it a good situation.
- Thank you, milady.
- Come with me, Sally.
Pleasant-looking girl.
I want everything
to be perfect for you, Elizabeth.
It will be.
The house looks wonderful, Julian.
- There's only one thing that frightens me.
- What's that?
That room upstairs.
- Here, look after him.
- Thank you, sir.
Sir. Hello.
You doing anything tonight, sir?
What do you got that mask on for?
Hey now, get a hold of him.
Hey, Gov'nor.
I'm very sorry, gentlemen.
It's perfectly all right.
- Perfectly all right, sir.
- Have you been to a party?
- Looks like he's been to a fancy dress ball.
- Come in and have a drink.
- Thank you, but I really haven't time.
- Come along with us.
- Come to Macgregor's and have a drink.
- You're very kind, but I must be going.
- Wait till you see what's going on there.
- Come on.
You're very kind,
but perhaps another time.
See what I mean?
- Sorry, dearie.
- What's he doing in that hood?
He must be very important
to hide his face.
Or very ugly. Or both.
How are you tonight, dearie?
Isn't that Prince what's-his-name?
Can they let him out at night?
- Too proud to show your face?
- Sally?
My name is Heidi.
But for every taste we have a name.
If you want me to be Sally,
I will be Sally.
Come with me.
How do you want me?
No, I shouldn't be here.
Of course you should.
What's the matter with you?
Are you frightened?
You can leave on your mask.
I don't mind.
I like you as you are.
That will cost you extra.
Give me the britches, darling.
And the dress.
I said extra for the dress.
That's my wife there,
mister, understand?
If you're the Prince of Wales, it's gonna
cost you money to get outta here.
And if you are the Prince of Wales,
it'll cost you even more.
And he has gold in his pockets
enough to blind you.
Has he now?
You'd better hand it over then.
Who the devil are you?
Come on, Heidi. We might have
a real treasure on our hands here.
Let's see what's behind this mask.
No. You won't get out of here...
until I see your face.
- It's a bear!
- It's a dancing bear.
- Dance!
- It is a bear!
Dance!
Yes, dance for us.
Dance.
Get off me!
Get him.
Boy! Stop!
Come back here!
Stop him, someone.
What's the matter with him?
Here, cut it out!
Murder!
Murder!
Bloody murder.
- What kind of a beast did that?
- I've told you. It was the man...
- I know. The man in the crimson hood.
- Going downstairs?
Away, all of you.
Out of the way. Go on.
- You must know who he was.
- Well, I don't.
And you didn't want to lose
this future customer?
No.
You don't think I'd set a loony
straight out of Bedlam on my lady, do you?
Knowing you, Harry, I'd say yes.
But we'll find out, won't we?
If anybody knows anything,
bring them along.
Very good, Mr. Hawthorne, sir.
You say this hooded figure had money.
So Heidi told me.
Which you were both going to
relieve him of?
No, we weren't.
No. You wouldn't do
anything like that, would you?
No, of course not.
- Would you say he was of the gentry?
- I don't know. He never talked to me.
Excuse me, sir. Take a look at this.
A cloak with blood on it.
- Hey, that's his cloak.
- That's his, all right!
- And he was wearing this cloak?
- Yes.
'J. N.'
- I wonder.
- What?
If there's anything
underneath that tape.
'E. P. Higgs.'
'Tailor.'
'Langford.'
There we are. Now you take those
and come back to see me in two days.
- Good bye.
- Bye, Doctor.
Hope you feel better soon.
- Dr. Neuhartt?
- Yes?
I'm a Crown Officer from London.
I want to speak to you.
Very well. Won't you come in?
These are your initials, Doctor,
and this is your cloak.
The tailor who made it told us so.
Yes, they are mine.
Why, that's blood.
Blood of a tart in London
who got her throat cut.
- Throat cut?
- By someone wearing that cloak.
I don't understand.
Dr. Neuhartt,
I must ask you some questions.
Where were you last night?
I was at the house of Mr. Jenkins,
the local magistrate. I was dining there.
He will confirm that.
Could you possibly explain how your cloak
came to be worn in London?
Why, no, I can't. I lost it.
I must have left it somewhere.
Where?
If I knew that, Mr. Hawthorne,
I wouldn't have lost it, would I?
I suggest you obtain confirmation of
my presence in Langford last night...
and continue your investigations
in London and take these with you.
- Good day to you.
- Thank you, Doctor. Good day.
- What did you tell them?
- I told them nothing.
You killed that woman, didn't you?
That's an interesting group
you have up there.
Thank you, Julian.
That's a fine composition.
I have a great deal of work
to do on that yet.
Here is a portrait that I just finished
for Lord Wallace.
I'd suggest the same size
for Lady Elizabeth.
A different style, of course,
for her entrancing beauty.
Julian, here are some more things
I think you might be interested in.
- That's a wonderful landscape.
- I think I can really be pleased with that.
You see this strong line coming
from left to right, right across the picture.
- Another line...
- Who is that a portrait of?
It's just a sketch I did from memory.
From memory?
Yes, some unknown man
my dog found dead in the river.
Now this other strong line
coming from top...
- Julian?
- Yes.
You don't know who it is, do you?
Quite a shock it was.
It just caught my eye.
Yes, it's quite an interesting face.
One plummets the depths for answers.
Only the customs...
Would you sell it?
Sell it? My dear Julian,
you can have it for nothing.
- Mysteries just disturb me.
- That's very kind of you, thank you.
Now for this forest picture,
I tried to get the feeling of the forest...
But I'm afraid I'm going to have
to be running along now.
We can work out the sittings later on.
Thank you so much,
I've really enjoyed...
You and Norton threw that body
into the river. Why?
- That's rubbish! Who says that?
- I do.
Because it's now in the hands
of a parish magistrate.
There was nothing on the body
to say who it was.
Except that it had been viewed earlier
by the people of my village...
as the body of my late brother.
And not only that.
The man who found it was an artist.
He made a sketch. Look.
Fortunately,
I managed to get hold of it.
Why didn't you put the body
back where it came from?
- Because it was too risky.
- Why?
Because it was. That's why.
Trench...
how did that man die?
- What are you so inquisitive about...
- What grave did it come from?
- What's this all about?
- You heard what I said. Answer me.
What are you hiding?
- I've got enough troubles of me own!
- I'm not hiding anything, man.
There's something going on
I don't like the sound of.
If it's as important as that
for you to know...
then it'd be far more important for me
not to tell you. And I'm not going to!
And another thing. After this,
there'll be no more dealings with me.
You've become far too nosy.
In my business,
that's taking too much of a risk.
- Weller...
- Good day, Doctor.
After Edward was free,
what happened then?
Nothing.
You locked him up, you nailed him down.
- Our plan didn't work.
- Go on.
Rescue was out of the question.
My God, Trench,
do you know what that means?
It means that my brother
was buried alive!
It's all gone.
I'll go and get some more.
You haven't been looking for me,
have you, Trench?
And we did have a bargain.
My God.
Sir Edward.
- I thought you'd been...
- Buried?
Yes.
Waking up in that horrible oblong box.
No air to breathe.
Trapped and no escape.
The earth raining down on the lid.
Every shovelful burying you more deeply.
No, Sir Edward. Julian...
Julian is to blame. I can explain.
All I want is that witch doctor!
That was the bargain, after all.
The Starbuck Inn.
Shoreham.
Shoreham.
Trench. Why Shoreham?
He was waiting...
for a ship.
Waiting? Why not waiting for me?
Are you the man I made my medicine for?
Yes.
It worked only too well.
Tell me.
Have you seen a face like mine before?
Once.
I want to know. Can you help me?
Yes. For gold.
Sit down.
Do you know what happened in Africa?
Why they did this to me?
I must know.
You are riding through the plantation.
A white king amongst his black slaves...
who are too ignorant to know
that you are an enemy.
No.
No!
I don't understand.
I know it wasn't me.
You are the man they call Markham?
It is also the name of my brother.
Markham.
You changed nothing!
It's still the same!
You've got to help me, Doctor.
You've got to give me something
to keep me going until the morning.
Very well, come with me.
- What's amusing you?
- It seems you started a fad, my dear...
when you claimed that you saw
a man with a crimson hood.
I did see him, you know I did!
Everybody's seeing him now.
There's a story here about a man...
in a crimson hood who murdered
a woman in London. He slit her throat.
- What is it, Sally?
- I can't believe it!
- What?
- That he'd do such a terrible thing!
Sally, have you seen
a man in a crimson hood?
There's a man staying with
Dr. Neuhartt who wears a hood like that.
- A man who wears a hood.
- I promised not to tell anyone!
Dr. Neuhartt. Yes, of course.
Elizabeth, forgive me,
I'm going out for a little while.
Look after Sally.
Ruddock.
If you don't keep off your feet,
you'll be dead in the morning.
That's all the time in the world
for what I have to do.
- More debts?
- The final debts.
And more blood?
First I want the reasons, Doctor,
then perhaps the blood.
'Blood will have blood, ' so they say.
Can't you understand?
You know what's been done to me.
Wouldn't you want the truth
and then your revenge?
How do you expect me
to know how you feel?
Here, drink this.
What is this?
It's what you wanted. Something
to keep you on your feet until the morning.
Or something to put me
back in the grave for eternity!
Why don't you sit down, my dear.
You look very pale.
I feel a lot better now.
I think we could both do
with a little brandy.
No, I'll get it.
Hello? Anyone there?
Open up! Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Who did this?
He attacked...
A man in a crimson hood?
Where did he come from?
He was still warm and straight
from the grave. Was that it?
Where did he go? I must find him.
Markham Manor.
Markham.
- No!
- Sally...
- You have to help me!
- You're a murderer!
- You don't understand anything!
- Please don't kill me!
- I must find Julian. Where is he?
- He's not here!
You're lying!
Elizabeth. What happened?
It was Sally.
She was here just a moment ago.
- Sally?
- Look!
- It's Edward.
- Edward?
Yes. I can't explain it now.
I'm going out. You stay here, Elizabeth.
- Julian!
- Please, stay here!
Edward.
Edward, stop!
Why, Julian?
Edward, stop! Let me explain!
Why, Julian?
Edward, it was an accident.
You!
- This should have been you!
- Yes, I know!
They were looking for a Markham
to pay back their debts.
They found their Markham,
but they took you and not me.
There was nothing I could do.
It was too late.
It's not too late, Julian.
Let them have both of us!
This is the one you wanted.
- Edward Markham?
- Yes.
Go now.
Markham.
Where is Sir Julian?
I think he went
to the top of the house, madam.
Julian, what is it?
Nothing.
- This is Edward's room, isn't it?
- No, Elizabeth.
This is my room.
