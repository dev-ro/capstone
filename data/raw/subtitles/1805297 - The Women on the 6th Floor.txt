Not 10, or 5, or4...
Don't bore me with your egg!
What's it now?.
It's Madame...
She wants to move Madame's room!
You reaIize?
My mother died 6 months ago,
the mourning's over.
Not for me.
For me, Madame's stiII here.
Madame Suzanne hated your mother.
She was very fond of her.
The day aftershe died she said...
ShaII I teII you?
PIease, don't.
Let me Iisten to the news.
Hi, Mrs TribouIet.
MrJoubert, it can't go on.
-What is it?

They partied aII night again!
They shouted and sang!
I didn't sIeep a wink.

Such a beauty!
Great to see you!
Look,

Yourbag weighs a ton.
Auntie, this is PiIar.
- Hi.
- DeIighted.
We traveIed together.
My paI
Iost a fortune in AIgerian oiI.
You're mistaken, Mr PeIIetier.
You have Aquitaine oiI
and you're up 100,000 francs.
OId francs?
No, 100,000 newfrancs.
I've Iost my gIasses...
Mr PeIIetier, be right with you.
We'II go to my office.
The stock market baffles me.
Howit moves...
My dad said: it's just a market.
But it seIIs stocks, not veggies.
Come aIong.
It's a fine house.
Where you offto?
Hi, Madame TribouIet...
My niece, Maria. Just got here.
The eIevator's not foryou!
Mrs TribouIet,
we have heavy bags.
EIevator's forthe owners.
Use the backstairs.
OK.
Let's go, kid.
''Use the backstairs!''
We'II see about that!
These hatboxes take up aII the room!
-They were forMadame's hats!
- She's in the graveyard!
You're just in time !
-What is it?
- Germaine !
She won't empty your mom's room.
Yourmom buIIied me,
I couIdn't change
a curtain, ora napkin ring!
You repapered ourbedroom.
Nowit's my home!
Germaine must understand!
- I'II taIk to her.
-Yes, do.
Germaine...
What's going on?
Such ingratitude!
To do that
to a motherwho adored you.
She neverIiked anyone,
you knowthat.
Madame Suzanne's meanness
kiIIed her!
You're insane!
She murdered her!
You hearher?
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do!
Then get out!
ReaIIy, Suzanne!
What's with you both?
You're paid to obey!
I do! I wasted myIife
forthankIess peopIe.
ThankIess...
You're a bad mother.
I raised yourkids!
You sent them to boarding-schooI!
Don't overdo it, Germaine!
I sIaved years foryou Jouberts.
Madame dies, and you fire me!
No, I'II quit on you!
So Iong, foIks!
Maybe it's too oId,
I can't make it shine.
I know a trick.
Use toothpaste,
spread it weII, and rub.
Toothpaste!
Yes.
I had no idea...
It's perfect.
Auntie! The Frenchwoman's crying.
Let's go see.
What's wrong with her?.
What's going on?
They kicked me out! ''Scram!''
Don't be sad.
We forget bosses fast.
You'II find a newfamiIy.
I don't want one!
Back in Brittany...
I have no one there now!
Maids get hired and fired.
Try this,
it's MaIaga wine, warms you up.
Who are you?
She's Maria, my niece.
I got here today.
And know French?
From the nun's schooI in Burgos.
We maids must get unionized.
We must unite against the bosses.
Don't Iisten, she's a Communist!
Yourpraying won't heIp us!
Shut up!
I won't. ReIigious nuts
Iike you prevent change.
So go to Russia!
Enough, you two!
Another shot? It's not bad...
To Spain!
Hi there! It's Germaine Le Bronnec.
I'm going home!
Be of good cheer!
Germaine Le Bronnec!
DarIing, I've no shirts Ieft.
They're aII dirty!
How'II I go to the office?
Weara sweater!
A sweater?.
Jean-Louis is going crazy.
We're Iike castaways!
StiII no news from Brittany.
Brittanymaids are over.
They're out!
We have Spanish maids now.
Right, CoIette?
My DoIores is a pearI.
You even forget she's Spanish.
She's so cIean,
even works on Sundays.
No French maid gives up herSunday!
Not a chance!
My DoIores insists
on one thing...
going to Mass...
at 6AM.
If that's aII...
A Spanish maid, why not?
It's simpIe,
theirHQ is nearby
at the Spanish church.
Go there and pick one.
Some speak no French,
others get by.
Many Iearnt French in convents.
If I were you,
I'd avoid city girls...
HeIIo, miss. I'm MrJoubert,
Madame's husband.
My wife spoke ofyou, Maria,
fresh from Spain
and here on a try-out?
If you want to stay here,
I'm a stickIerforone thing:
boiIed eggs.
I'm fussy about that,
got it from my dad.
An egg that's too soft ortoo hard
ruins my day.
You understand?
I think
you don't get what I'm saying.
If the egg is perfect,
my day is made.
In Spain,
we have superstitions, too.
No, it's not a superstition.
It's more Iike...
How can I put it...
It's not a superstition.
Not at aII!
3 1/2 minutes.
HeIIo.
Got the Figaro?
In the kitchen cIoset,
we store tabIecIoths, napkins...
On top, the Iinen,

Undersheets aren't mattress covers!
This is the Limoges china...
Don't confuse the pIain gIasses,
with the Baccarats!
Answerthe phone, write down

OfficiaIIy, I'II pay you 250.
The rest, not a word to Madame.

Men don't knowwhat they want.
By the time they ask,

Monsieurdidn't want marriage!
He hesitated, wasn't sure...
I was a country girI,
I heId out and he married me!
Once you've got a man,

If a man doesn't want me,
that's his Ioss.

Sure, who hasn't?
My father

Franco's men sIit theirthroats
in front ofme.
Then,
they dragged the bodies
through the streets.
That was the Spanish civiI war.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
They Iive in tiny rooms,

It was their choice.
They're up at 6 AM, work aII day,

dead-tired and don't compIain,
they're happy.
You neverworry about anybody,
suddenIy
you care about Spanish maids!
They Iive above us,
and we knownothing about them.
You care forthose Spanish women,
but not about what I did!

At 11AM you had yourfeet done,

Germaine Ieft us.

That's viIe!
You expIoited herfor20 years,

First, we didn't ''expIoit'' her,
and she decided to Ieave.
And who's that one?
''That one'' is Maria. She's Spanish.
No kidding?
You hired a Spaniard?
AbsoIuteIy.
And be nice to her!
For breakfast, we want pate, saIami.

In a way, Germaine was ourMom.
We'II even miss herIousy soups!
She neversaid goodbye!
Gone for good!
And I never sawher bare-assed!
Let us pray.
Nowwe'II pray in siIence.
Buy The Daily Worker!
The paperthat fights expIoiters!
It's a disgrace for Spain

I won't force you

I'd ratherdie!
Won't foIIow Dad?
My French teachersays

Screw Franco!

I can't foIIow you anymore.
The point is, Bertrand

No, it's his Iiver.
My grandpa had gas.
Yourgrandpa was a drunk!
We'II cure you.
Maria, the cure!
- Open yourmouth!
- No, you're kind.
Open your mouth.
FeeIing better?.
Yes. Much better.
The cure worked very weII.
Get back into bed.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You want to heIp me?
Of course!
- He's a gift from heaven.
- Maria hit the jackpot!
Look, Teresa!
Hey, Brigitte Bardot,

With no wig she was cuter.
You're jeaIous!
Thanks.

RodoIphe can't come?
Countess de MorIaix needs him.
He said to repIace him here.
He couId have wamed me!
Don't worry, I knowmy job.

A Iong time ago. Too Iong.

Best to get stung by a paI!
You're rough.
Knowmy friend Goimard?
Yourboarding-schooI paI.
AbsoIuteIy.
How's Marie-Francoise?
PIeased with Maria?
DefiniteIy, NicoIe.
My maid's touchy,
everything miffs her!
Spaniards aren't touchy,
they're proud, that's different.
Proud, fearIess...
FearIess?
What's fearIess
about using a floor-mop?
Try it, NicoIe!
Madame de BrossoIette,
deIighted...
Stop caIIing me Madame,
it's such a bore.
I'm nuts about Spain.
Chorizo, paeIIa, tabouIe.
-TabouIe isn't Spanish!
-What?
TabouIe isn't Spanish!
-TabouIe's not Spanish?
- No.
But FIamenco is!
Who's that taIking to Jean-Louis?
Bettina de BrossoIette.
That's her?
Sure is.
Here she is...
Madame de BrossoIette,
Suzanne, my wife.
DeIighted.
Jean-Louis

Stocks, bonds...
I'm Iike you,

I trust him impIicitIy.
Whatever happens, he'II protect me.
Yes, he's very protective.
- Right?
-Very.
I Iive far, in the burbs.
And you?
In the buiIding.
On the 6th with the others?
Yes.
What room number?
My room's...

4! My Iucky number!
Maria, cut it out.
Don't Iisten to her, 4 is my room.
Very cute,

Aren't you bored?
AIone in yourIittIe bed?
You about through?
Just kidding.
You know aII men need a mommy!
But I don't want to generaIize,
I've onIybeen married 3 times!
Excuse me.
Listen, Maria,
it's foryourown good.
I mean no harm.
You're needed
in the drawing-room, Gerard.
CertainIy, sir.
What do you think of steeI today?
Usinor's going up. Time to buy?
-Where's that guy?
- Dumping the trash.
Madame wants you.
You can Ieave now.
I've cIeaning to do.
Scram! You get it?
I got it.
She's offIimits!
HeIIo, sir.
You got here so Iate.
Madame said I couId this morning.
The apartment's a mess.
Because ofthe party.
Don't mention the party!
My work wasn't good?
You know what I mean!
Think you'II get away with it,
because I...
I warn you, next time you're out!
What did I do?
What did you do?
You're Iucky
Madame's so fond ofyou.
- OreIse...
- In fact,
you're just a boss Iike the others.
Worse than they are!
Go away. Get out of my sight!
He's for NapoIeon,
she's a royaIist.
She's Protestant, he's CathoIic...
He flaunted Bettina in yourhouse!
For aII Paris to see!
Suzanne, you don't deserve that!
Think so?
But Bettina's one ofhis customers.
He handIes her portfoIio.
He couId've warned you!
The Ieast he couId do,
considering her reputation!
For Jean-Louis,
I'm stiII a country girI.
What he Iikes are...
dazzIing Parisian beauties.
Don't say that,
you're so deIightfuI.
Anyway...
Have you seen my cigarettes?
No.
I Ieft them here.
HeIIo, Mr Jean-Louis.
-You OK?
- Fine.
We're partying at PiIar's pIace.
ReaIIy...
- Join us?
-Yes, do!
No, thanks.
Don't argue! Come aIong!
What fun, have a drink!
MrJean-Louis!
Thanks forthis pIace.
It's so nice. Come in.
MrJean-Louis! You're a saint,
you'II go to heaven.
You're invited to our party!
I can't stay.
My wife is waiting forme.
She can come too!
Madame Joubert is so eIegant.
Can I go, Madame?
Yes, Maria. Have a nice time.
Good night, Madame.
See you tonight,
Bettina
See, she even got giant gambas!
He got the pIace for PiIar.
It's a great pIace.
Just what I need.
Ask Mr Jean-Louis to heIp.
Encarnacion paid 1,000 francs
to the former janitorforhers.
1,000 francs!
But it had a shower.
In my house in Spain,
I'II have severaI tubs!
We've heard that before!
Does that house even exist ?
Stop it.
Here's proof.
Isn't it?
Look, Mr Jean-Louis.
It's my husband Fernando.
He's buiIding me a marbIe bathroom
with goIden faucets.
I sawthem in a store here.
I don't trust tubs,
they're dangerous.
In what way?
Josephina
took a bath in her boss's tub,
and she got pregnant.
I'd say...
Josephina...
did more than take a bath!
When I get back to Spain
everybodywiII envy me formy house.
And we'II be bosses.
Sure...
I'II never go back to Spain.
WhiIe that murdererruIes,
I'II stay here.
Franco won't Iast forever.
Maria,
one day you shouId make paeIIa
at home.
If you wish, sir.
PaeIIa forme.
Good evening!
This is MrArmand.
DeIighted.
I'm honored, Iadies!
I own the beauty shop nearhere.
The ritzy one, where the bosses go?
That very one!
Stop by,
I'II be deIighted to do your hair,
forhaIf price!
My head's spinning!
Good night, MrJean-Louis.
I was wrong.
You're not just a boss.
Not in bed?
No, I waited up foryou.
-You had dinner?.
-Yes, thanks.
You couId've warned me.
I'm sorry,
I thought ofit,
but it went by so fast!
Sure... Where were you?
You won't beIieve it.
Go ahead.
You know PiIar,
who works forthe DubreuiIs,
on rue CoIIignon.
No... I don't know PiIar.
Doesn't matter.
I got hera pIace, a staII...
A staII... at the opera?
No, for a janitor.
They ceIebrated it
with a IittIe party.
Can't you teII the truth?
It's true! We ate a paeIIa!
Teresa sang a copIa.
Was Bettina there too?
Bettina?
Don't deny it, she was there too!
You're so wrong!
What's with this Bettina?
You went to that gaIIery opening?
What opening?
Where were you?
I dined with the Spanish maids.
Don't taIk nonsense!
Stop it!
Forweeks you've had a smug smiIe
on yourface,
you strut around!
I knowwhen something's going on!
Were you with Bettina?
Yes orno?
Yes... I was with Bettina.
The humiIiation...
Let's go to bed, I'm exhausted.
No, we're not going to bed.
You must Ieave this house.
I neverwant to see you again,
get out!
Go away!
HeIIo, Iadies.
The hazards of existence force me
to Ieave ourfamiIy home
forwhat shouId be a short period.
Fate is capricious,
and the femaIe character
unpredictabIe.
I hope to be a discreet and quiet
neighbor. I wish you a good day.
Sorry.
Have a nice day.
It's a nightmare.
-You knewit.
- No way.
Hi, Mrs TribouIet!
PIease bring up the maiI
to the 6th floor, room 3.
SIip it underthe door.
Good day, Mrs TribouIet!
Good day.
Don't make my tea, I'm going out.
Listen, Monsieur has Ieft home.
I don't knowwhere he is,
and I don't care!
Take care of his Iinen.
When the kids are back,
he can take them out.
He's unweIcome here.
Very weII, Madame.
We don't distrust men enough.
Neverforget that.
I have it, Genevieve.
I have it.
WeII?
Isn't this better?
Hi, Carmen.
Evening.
Hi, Concepcion.
Evening.
- How Iong'II he stay here?
- Don't ask me.
What do you care?
I don't Iike having a man up here.
He won't sneak into your room!
Don't be so sure!
- Hi, Carmen.
- Mr Jean-Louis,
you're the owner, do as you pIease.
But we stay in ourown corner.
But this is my home.
No, bosses beIong with bosses.
Don't mingIe with the servants.
Sorry, Carmen. I'm staying here.
Why?
It's my first room of my own.
First came boarding schooI,
then the army,
then marriage.
I reaIIyfeeI free now.
-The 20 I owed you.
-Thanks.
DoIores,
where's it from?
Savings I earned
with the sweat ofmy brow.
And you keep it here?
Yes.
Concepcion,
what do you do with your money?
I send it to my husband
forthe house.
And the money you don't send?
I keep it in a shoe-box.
Invest it!
- ''Invest it''?
-WeII-invested, it earns more!
What does that mean?
In the stock market!
It's simpIe, I'II expIain.
Don't Iisten.
CapitaIists are bandits.
Let him expIain.
In the market
there are stocks and bonds.
What are stocks?
Like when you stock up
on something?
In the stock market, it's different.
Let's say, aII 5 ofyou want to buy
a restaurant.
Where we serve paeIIa?
No paeIIa! French cuisine!
You'II need capitaI,
Iet's say a miIIion francs.
You don't have it,
so you issue 10,000 shares.
It's the capitaI peopIe invest
in your restaurant.
HandIe it weII, Mr Piquer!
Aquitaine OiI's up 2 1/2 points.
I don't trust Aquitaine OiI...
Look, Usinor's up.
That's the one I Iike.
Hi, Mrs TribouIet.
Thanks forthe maiI.
Concepcion Ramirez.
DoIores CarvaiIIaI.
Carmen...
Hi, Mrs TribouIet!

-Thanks a Iot.

-That's aII.
Have a nice day!
I'II take the peonies...
Fine.
and the roses.
In fact, a mixed bouquet.
Very good.
There.
HeIIo, Mrs TribouIet!
HeIIo, Senora Joubert.
Why ''Senora''?
It's because ofMr Joubert.
What about him?
You don't know?.
He's Iiving up on the 6th,
with the Spaniards!
On the 6th?
It's common knowIedge!
It's gone on for 2 weeks!
Have a nice day, Mrs Joubert.
Spanish Without Tears
Here, Mr Jean-Louis,
it's hoIy water
from the Virgin of Lourdes.
You were in Lourdes?
I went in the grotto,
where St Bemadette sawthe Virgin.
I cIosed my eyes,
feIt her hand on my head.
And she whispered into my ear.
What did she say?
''In 10 years,
you'II have a baby boy.
''He'II be caIIed Javier.''
You can't give birth at 60, DoIores!
The Virgin Mary performs miracIes.
Maybe in the MiddIe Ages,
but not now.
Listen.
Teresa has something to teII you.
The finest day ofmy Iife!
MrArmand asked me.
What did he askyou?
To marry him! I'm getting married!
A miracIe!
You'II move out?
Anyway, I'm through being a maid!
To work in the beauty shop?
She'II do shampoos?
No, handIe the cash register!
At first, I'II stay home
and wash the bIouses,
then I'II iron them,
and in the morning I'II mop
the floorand tidy up.
I'II buy yourwedding gown.
Made ofwhite siIk and Iace?
Whateveryou want!
This one's the best!
My dad said:
''They're forspeciaI occasions.''
I aImost opened one
the day he died.
That's not nice.
Just kidding.
But Teresa's marriage is one.
And now I knowyou aII...
You think you knowme,
but you don't.
I have a son.
He's 8 years oId.
I never married.
So nowyou can fire me:
I made a chiId in sin.
Not at aII.
You have a chiId, that's wonderfuI!
He was adopted by a famiIy.
My mom was so ashamed of me,
I had to abandon him.
The father, was a man Iike you.
A big owner.
I'm not a big owner.
I Iive on the 6th floor.
You'II aIways be an owner.
MrJean-Louis, thanks!
It's good stuff, it's Bordeaux.
Sit down.
Nowwe'II sing. You sing aIong.
- I don't knowhow!
- Give it a try.
He's on the 6th floor!
Living in an attic room?
That's howit is,
my IittIe chickies!
Yourfatheris infatuated
with those Spaniards.
- It's outrageous!
-A scandaI!
He's unworthy!
It's hiIarious.
I never saw it coming
and I threwhim out!
My darIings, yourmother's an idiot!
We'II taIk to him at once.
Remind him of his duty.
And ofhonor.
That's good ofyou, kids.
Ourhouse is aImost finished...
Who are they?
Where's our dad's room?
You're MrJean-Louis' kids?
ExactIy!
LittIe bIond Frenchies!

What a nice surprise! Come in!
Thanks, Concepcion.
Have a nice day.
So kids, you're visiting

Some chorizo? A drop of MaIaga?
- Dad, we came to ask you...
- SoIemnIy.
To come back down.
-Why?
- Because.
This can't go on.
Dad, we're very worried.
About your inheritance?
Don't make jokes!
It's no pIace foryou.
Forthe first time
I feeI in my pIace.
Here I discovered...
a famiIy.
-AfamiIy?
-Yes.
But they're servants.
No, they're not. They're fine women.
I hope you find
some Iike them to Iove.
Go, sit down.
Sit down.
Things OK, Iadies?
Yes, thanks.
Everything fine?
Very weII, thanks.

He'II take us by car!
Like great Iadies!
Ladies,

Wait for me!
But you're not devout!
I Iove the countryside.
Don't argue. Come Iong, Madame.
On the 6th floor?
With the Spanish maids?
How do you cope with it?
It's an outrage!
Don't Iet him offthe hook.
Get Attorney Simon foryour divorce,
he's tough.
He did the MontaIemberts'.
He'II make Jean-Louis pay up!
BIeed him to death.
But maybe Jean-Louis is right.
He put some joy in his Iife.
Those women up there are aIive.
Down here we're dead.
We need a 6th floor, too.
The boss says :
''Get the gato in the kitchen!''
I bring back the gato,
and she screams!
ReaIIy?
Instead ofthe cake,
you got the cat!
''Gateau'' is cake in French,
everybodyknows that.
So you put the cat in the fridge!
No! The gato, I ate it!
You ate the cat?
- PiIar.
- Sir!
-You feII asIeep?
-Yes.
I'II heIp you.

-Yes?
Yourson...

You know where MigueI is?
His new famiIy put him in a schooI,
San SaIvador CoIIege in Santander.
In Santander?.
You've known Iong?
A Iong time.
And you didn't teII me?
I swore it to your mother.
Why did you teII me now?
MrJean-Louis Ioves you.
What do you care?
What Don Pedro did wasn't enough?
It's not the same.
As you wish.
But if you go to Santander

Thanks, MrJean-Louis

Nice of you.

Yes, Maria.
I must teII you...

on the border
between France and Spain.
It's the perfect pIace for us to go.
And Madame? And the kids?
Who cares? I don't.
You're being siIIy.
Not at aII.
It's where King Louis XIV
married the Infanta of Spain.
- I swear! It's a historicaI fact!
-You're not a king,
and I'm no Infanta!
What'II you do aII day? TeII me?

You're no handyman!

Don't say: ''We'II see''!
Say: ''I promise you''.
Right, I promise you.
But you must promise me something,

Go back home.
No. Not that.
You can go down again,
since we're both Ieaving.
- PIease think it over.
- I aIready have.
Mr BIamond wiII take overthe firm.
And your boys?
It's a father-to-son firm.
They're too young,

It's too Iate, I have to Ieave!
Going on a trip?
Yes, a trip. You're right!
Atrip
that may Iast quite a Iong time.
For me?
Of course.
You know,
I've thought a Iot...
About me, about you, about us.
I've thought too.
It's funny,
I don't see Iife the same way now.
Like me...
I want to start from scratch.
AwhoIe newIife.
That's what I was saying,
as I came over.

But she won't go there.
Did she say anything forme?
Did she Ieave a note?
She said to forget her.
She won't be back.
She said that?
Carmen?
Is she teIIing the truth?
Yes.
It's true.
I'm so sorry, sir.
So you knew she was Ieaving?
And nevertoId me?
I thought you were my friends.
3 years Iater
PIease, the CaIIe de Ias Canteras?
Straight ahead.
The Ieak's not fixed! You're a bum!
My motherwas right!
I don't beIieve it!

I was nearby and said I'II go hug

So handsome! My word!
So there it is, your house!

A Iot isn't done...
If my husband worked more

You must be Femando?
Yes.
DeIighted, Mr Jean-Louis.
How are you?
Just fine.
Don't botherwith him.

Yes.
She Iives nearby, Ieft her husband.

Hurry! Move your butt!
Stingy bum!
Drives me nuts...
He's useIess!
When I was in Paris,
he cheated on me with Encarnacion,
the neighbor.
I shouId've kicked him out,
but I didn't.
So it goes.
In Spain, you can't divorce.
But you need him

Come, I'II show you around.
Isn't it great?
Atub fora movie star!
Sure it is! Look!

And Madame Suzanne?
We divorced.
In France, one can do that.
And she met a successfuI artist.
And Mrs. TribouIet?
Now she Ioves Spaniards,
but hates the Portuguese.
Poor Portuguese!
Concepcion, I came to find Maria.
What do you want with her?
To understand.
She neversaid goodbye.
3 years Iater, it's to say goodbye?
I know, it's absurd.
I stiII think ofher.
I expect nothing from her,
but I want to see her.
I'd Iike to heIp you,
if I knewwhere she is.
I heard she Iived nearby.
No! She Ieft a Iong time ago.
Got back herson, Ieft forGaIicia.
Then, no more news.
