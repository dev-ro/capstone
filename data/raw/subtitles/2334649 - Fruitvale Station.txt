He's on a breathing machine, right now.
His breathing is stable.
The main problem is the internal bleeding.
We've had some difficulty
stopping the bleeding..
that's getting his blood to clot.
He hasn't fully responded
to the transfusions, yet.
But he's going to make it right?
But he's going to make it.
I promise you, we're gonna do
everything we can okay?
Please do whatever you can, please.
We gotta lift him up, you all.
We gotta lift Oscar up.
You all, let's pray.
Heavenly father...
We kneel before you..
and ask you..
to put your healing hands around your child.
We ask you dear Lord...
to operate through these doctors;
Breathe strength into their hands Lord,
as they work on him.
We are asking you right now,
to heal him.
Oh, Heal him lord,
so we can hold him and see his smile again.
In your name, we pray. Amen.
He didn't make it.
I need to see him.
Okay, you can see him.
But they don't want you go into
the room and detach him.
Cos they ruled it a homicide.
I need to see him.
I need to see him.
I can take her.
- Okay.
I told him to catch the train.
I told him to catch BART!
I didn't know they were gonna hurt him.
I should have just let him drive.
I should have let him drive.
I wanted him to be safe.
You gotta let me hug him.
Please, let me hug him.
Please.
He didn't like to be alone!!
Come on, T.
Where’s Daddy?
