The story of this film is
based in the city of Chennai
Since the local language is Tamil
many characters speak only that
With an expectation that everyone
understands Tamil to a certain extent...
...and seeking your blessings too
we begin the film now
'Caste, religion, our land, language,
reality, science, nature, living things...'
'...poor, rich, clever, fool, birth, death,
wedding, funeral, joy, sorrow, night, day'
'A common factor
oblivious to all this exists'
'TIME'
'TIME'
'There are 2 types of time'
'Good time and bad time'
'Good times make
a pauper a prince'
'The reverse is true
if bad time falls'
'Bad time befell
a man in USA...'
'...a gathering of VIPs
there was a bomb blast!'
'Using that as an excuse
his wife divorced him'
'I worked 24x7
only for my wife'
'When she is no longer with me
why do I need all this?' he felt
'He willed his wealth
to an ashram...'
'...and became a pauper'
'His bad time reflected on my boss
in Chennai who depended on him'
'He could not pay
his workers their salary'
'New recruits were
given the pink slip!'
'My bad time began then'
'I had applied for a bank loan
for my younger sister's wedding'
'That also came to a full stop'
'In one's bad time, a bomb in USA
can circulate its stink here!'
'To conduct my sister's wedding
I asked Loan Shark Raja for a loan'
1st question Raja asked me
'Got a wife?'
- No
- Why?
I'm not yet married!
- Do you own a house?
- He shares a room with me
What did you say
your name was?
Matthew
- Uh...?
- Matthew
Listen, John
1st point
No wife and
no property
2nd point
You are his collateral
On the 3rd of every month, on the dot
he should pay me the interest
3rd point
Capital amount should
be settled within 4 months
Okay
Raja, I'll somehow
return your money
But don't come here,
to my house for your dues
'God! This isn't his house?!'
Yesterday was your deadline
You dare hang up on my calls!!
Are you a big shot?!
Raja...somehow
I'll pay you back
Trust me, Raja
Get up
Sit down
Your house...your dining table
your chair...sit down, Mayilu
Just pay me what's due
I'll vanish immediately
Such a beautiful house
Your bedroom is awesome
Your rest room is even better
Italian marbles, huh?
I slept there last night
So pay me...instead
of bamboozling me
I'll somehow repay you
'It wasn't me'
'It was the chair
scraping the floor'
This settles the interest
What about the capital?
I'll pay you within
the next 2 or 3 days
2 or 3?
I gave you jewelry worn
by my children and wife
2 or 3?
3 days
Right point!
Correct?
Cash...?
Correct, brother
Come, let's go before
he asks more questions
John, what are
we getting into?
Don't be scared
If we pay up on time
he'll be fine
- You will, won't you?
- Of course, come
I thought you said
this is his house
How did I know?
He gave this address
I assumed it is his
Black...?
White...?
Bro wants us
Get the egg
Sometimes brute force works
more than beseeching words!
If you don't stick to your time frame
your Ambassador car will be mine!
Okay, Raja
You know me
only too well, Mayilu
Toe my line
You are demanding too much
Sorry, you are
NOT qualified
'4 months since
my sister got married'
'First 2 months I somehow managed
to repay capital and interest'
'Past 2 month I've been
dodging Raja asking for extra time'
'Now I don't know
how to answer him'
'Today is the last day'
'If I don't settle the money today
Raja will probably kill me!'
'I've asked John
Wonder if he can get it for me'
'Jeena...!'
'When I was in the 6th grade,
she joined as a 4th grader'
'I ignored her because
I was so focused in my studies'
'2 years later she reached 6th grade
I was still in the same grade!'
'That day it dawned on me
there is victory in failure too!'
'Girls who are ugly ducklings
generally grow up to be swans'
'Same with her too'
'As soon as I got my job
I went to propose to her'
Hope I'm not
stinking of cigarette
Jeena...a huge fire at
the Vadapalani Junction
2 vehicles collided
That's why I'm late
Am I still stinking
of cigarette?!
I wanted to
tell her something
Grass?
Grass!
My friends tell me quite often
that I'll give my wife a hard time
Are you ready
to suffer with me?
Whaaat?!
I just wondered
if you don't mind the trouble
It would be awesome
if you agree, no?
1 week is over
2 weeks have sped past
3 weeks galloped fast
I've also been waiting 3 weeks
to profess my love for you
You've never been on time!
Tomorrow I'll be on time
I won't come tomorrow
Oh! Now what will I do?
- Idiot!
- Me!?!
I've been waiting for you all these
weeks...what more should I do, idiot?
Nothing more, right?
Aiyo!
Sorry
"As a door opened slowly silently
who darted into my life unknowingly?"
"For whom is she yearning
expectantly...like a sentry waiting?"
"Who is she so frank and up front
who dreams with me, never hesitant"
"Who is she who knows when I'm fibbing
More than my shadow, always following"
"As a door opened slowly silently
who darted into my life unknowingly?"
"Whom is she expecting
longingly...like a sentry waiting?"
Good Lord!
Her face isn't pretty at all
As if you saw her face!
"Through poetry or prose romantically
can love be expressed exotically"
"How do I pinpoint exactly when
doors of my heart chose to open?"
"Times when I inflict pain unknowingly
my love, you look into my eyes adoringly"
"When you found me, searching far and wide
I was clueless of your love for me inside"
"As a door opened gently silently
who walked into my life unexpectedly?"
"For whom is she yearning
expectantly...like a sentry waiting?"
- Who is she?
- My sister
Where are you going?
Home
Are you drunk?
Who...me?!
"My faults have no boundary
lam just a gift so ordinary"
"Piling more than I deserve really
Love you shower so generously"
"Though I see myself mirrored in you
still you are my 'forever friend' so true"
"As you relate to me as my soul mate
you didn't profess in words till date"
"As a door opened slowly silently
who stepped into my life unknowingly?"
"For whom is she yearning
expectantly...like a sentry waiting?"
"Who is she so frank and up front
who dreams with me, never reluctant"
"Who is she who knows when I'm fibbing
More than my shadow always following"
'First kiss'
'By the sea-side'
'Sunset'
'Oh God!
Make it unique!'
- Uncle...?
- Indeed!
When did you come
from Coimbatore?
- Get lost, boy!
- What's up?
Go home, my girl!
Go! Go home
He and his inquiries
Get lost!
'I went with my sister
and brother-in-law...'
'...to Jeena's house asking
for her hand in marriage'
'Her dad agreed
without many objections'
I wanted to talk to you
Good that you've come now
What is it, uncle?
How's your work front?
Not yet got a proper job
I am trying hard
Oh yes! Sure...you are trying!
You lost your job
the day you got engaged
I've been hearing this
like a broken record
It was sheer foolishness
to have consented to this alliance
I'm waiting to get a job
that pays a good salary
It'll come through soon
After you have sent me
on a funeral parade?
I'm also a dad who wants
a supportive son-in-law
I'm not interested
in this alliance any more
Listen, dear...?
Let's give him some time
For our daughter's sake
You mind your business
instead of interfering
From now on, you can't
roam around with my daughter...
...to the beach, theater or send
endless text messages
Do you understand?
- Uncle...?
- Don't 'uncle' me
I gave my word to Jeena
Not to you
And vice versa
she has promised me
Think it over
and decide properly
Otherwise, I'll be forced
to think differently
This is my house
Drink your tea and leave
Ma...Jeena, see you?
- Shall I take leave?
- Okay
I'll call you later
- Tell me, Jeena
- Hello, Matthew?
It doesn't seem like dad
will change his mind
I'll be leaving home
in another half hour
It's all in your hands now
What happened?
I can relate to only
those who keep their word
The groom's side is
coming to 'see' me tomorrow
I can't stay here much longer
I'm leaving right now, Matthew
- Listen carefully-
- No...wait...l know!
You don't have
a job as of now
I have to take care
of you till you do
Also you smoke
And when you get
drunk, you blabber
Also, you snore loudly
You'll go bald...isn't that
what you wanted to say?
Jeena! All that is right
But not only that
This is an important
decision in your life
Like your papa Says"-
...later on you mustn't feel
it was a foolish decision
So come with me only after
thinking it over very well
Jeena...?
I'll wait near Church road
Have you thought it over?
I'll wait there for you
Okay, I'll go to John's office
to collect the money
You wait right there
I'll come and
then we'll decide
Okay
Hello?
Brother?
What, Matthew? Are you
settling the cash today?
I've asked John for it
I'll call when I get it, bro
Whether you ask John or
any other son of a mongrel!
You've been promising and
dodging me for a month!
Today is your last date
If you miss it,
I'll send the boys home
And slit you
John's calling
I'll talk to him and call you
You know me well, Matthew
Be careful what you do
Tell me, John
What happened?
The cash is ready
Come over and collect it
Thanks,da
- I'll be right there
- Come soon
Jeena, have you left?
She has left, you dog!
Where are you?
'Wonder if she has left home
why her phone is not with her?'
Brother...?
Rs 500?
Nit wit! By evening you had
better settle the balance
Here!
Brother...?
Clutch plate and break
are not okay, bro
Road belongs to my dad
Whoever comes in your way,
trash him away and keep driving!
Get lost
Where's the cash?
Sorry, I was actually
stuck up with some work
So I couldn't get in
touch with you, Raja
- What's your name?
- Manick
That day you gave
some other name...?
Manickam is my name, dude
Are you trying to pull
a fast one on me?
What's your full name?
Manickunju...!
Manickunju...!
I thought Manik Basha the don!
You said you will
settle it last week
I couldn't get the money
But I'll surely arrange
and give it to you
Don't show off
It won't work with me
Come here
Come here, da!
Oh Lord!
My dear brother
Don't take this
It's a birthday gift
from my brother
Don't you know Chacko Nair
Jeweller from Kerala?
- No...
- Then I can't give it
I lent you money because
your brother is filthy rich
If you don't want him to know, settle
the amount by 2:00 or 2:30 p.m today
- 2:00 or 2:30?
- What?
2:00 or 2:30?
Okay 2:00 evening
I will ready you
But you shouldn't
inform my elder brother
Okay? Please?
Oh forgot!
Bro, can you
lend me 500?
- Hello brother-in-law
- Matthew! How are things?
- How's work going?
- Good...what else?
How's my sister?
What does she lack...?!
I came here to
Chennai on work
I thought I would
visit you at your office
I've taken off today
Tell me when your work is done
and I'll come and see you
Okay then!
I'll call you when I'm done
Okay
Why didn't you shave?
Come to my cabin
He wants me in
his cabin to shave me!
Don't grin
You give this to Loan shark-Raja
Don't call me
if you need anything
I'll be in a meeting
Why did you shave?
Oh! Female...sorry!
- Hello?
- Matthew? It's me
You forgot to take
your phone, right?
Why don't you remember to take
everything when you leave home?
I called you
Your dad answered
So I didn't talk much
Where are you now?
In a booth
near the bus depot
Matthew...and-
What happened?
My dearest Jeena
Can't you be careful?
If you can't be careful
why do you wear it?
Matthew, what can I do?
Okay, forget it
Don't be upset
I am in the next street
I'll pay Raja and come
Okay

Where is John's office?
Who are you?
Don't you have manners to come into
my classroom without permission?
This is not a fish market, okay?
Country creeps!
What are you looking at?
I'll call the security!
Security?
Security!
Enacted and produced

And the specialty of this film is
it's been shot in a single room
Brother...l gave Matthew the money
He has gone to hand it over to you
I was being tolerant
because you are youngsters
And you dare play with me?!
You've been dodging me for a month
He's not picking up my calls!
Call him now
John...?!
My gawwd!
He's not picking up
I'll definitely talk
to him and call you
Please, brother
Go tell that to some
naive kids, not to me
You have just 1 hour more
He doesn't pick up,
finish off this fellow
You know about me well, John
Better toe my line
They've gone?
Who are they?
One minute

Is it a holiday today?
How to go inside?
Go in that way
You've spelt Mandaveli wrong
Wonder from where
such specimens come!
Is this a police station or what?
Sir?
Sir!
What do you want?
I have come to

Oh! I see
- Did he ask for money?
- No money or anything
Did not demand money?
He kidnapped her

Thank you, sir
"Wicked Lord Kannan..."
Hello?
Hello, Matthew
Where are you?
Jeena...?
What happened?
Someone snatched away
the money I was to pay Raja
I don't know
what to do now
Matthew, don't get tensed
You come here
We'll try somewhere else
Hello?
Brother!
You scum bag!
You won't pick up my call?
Do you think
you are a big shot?
When I got the money from John...
...someone stole it
from me, brother
See if your other parts are with you!
Next you'll say
someone stole that as well
What holds good for you
holds good for me
Don't try and spin
a yarn on me
Only 1 point
You have time only
till 5 this evening
Capital + interest
If there's a mess up...
...I'll take care of you whichever
corner of the world you are in
No other points!
Hello?
I'm good, dude
What, you dog?!
- Hello, Matthew?
- What happened, da?
Hello?
How much?
- How much?
- 50000?
I can't hear you properly
As if you could
think of only me!
I'm getting married next month
Actually...
Ask me anything but money
I'll lay down my life for you
lam in the church
Call me later
My foot!
I'm in a tight spot
I'm locked outside my house
I don't have a single
paisa with me
Let me ask my dad
Tomorrow is Jhansi's birthday
Buy a quarter
Come to my room
Let's discuss it
Sorry, dude...not today
Hello?
I'm Sub Inspector calling
from Mandaiveli station
Tell me, sir
Where have you
hidden Jeena?
Sir?
Where have you
kidnapped Jeena to?
Sir, I have no idea
what you are saying?
Aren't you a Malayali, you moron?
She's my fiancee
Why should I kidnap her?
Whatever it is...!
You had better land up here,
at 5:00 p.m with that girl
If you think you can
string me along...
...I'll strangle you from 'sa' to 'pa' and
punch your 'ma' like off key notes of a song!
You'll end up as
Chenchurutti raga!
Sir, who has given
the complaint?
Your...!!!
Come to the station first,
I'll tell you then!
Hello?
- Hey senior!
- Sir?
- Will you finish painting today?
- Definitely, sir
Huh?
Must have been her father
That Coimbatore toad
Hello, dude
I need a packet
For how much?
- 5,000
- 5,000?!
Are you already stoned?
No, I meant a girl's rate!
Get me for about 500
500...where are you?
Here only...near
Mandaiveli station
That sub-inspector is weird
Better scoot from there
As if my brother
has no clout?!
I'll come here
and you call me
Whaaat?!
See you?
Where did he lock his shop
and disappear?
Come, guys!
Good Lord...dad!
It has been 7...no...8 days
since I got the card
Oh! Forget it
Give me a BSNL coupon
Coupons are out of stock
Available only in the evening
Should I wait till evening
to make my calls?
- Will this phone work?
- Yes, sir
- When will you finish it?
- Today, sir
Past 2 days you've been
repeating the same dialog
- Sir?
- What?
Sir...uh...nothing, sir!
Sir, I'm Johnnykutty
I had complained about
my missing daughter
Did you get any leads?
I spoke to the boy
But there appears
to be some issues
He said she was his fiancee
Have they eloped
by any chance?
I gave you his number
so that you could arrest him
Not for you to enquire
about his well being
At least call him again
Smooth-talk to him
Find out where he is, catch him,
lock him up and deal with him
He will sing out
the truth like a parrot
Who gave a person like you
a post in the police force?
- Mr Johnnykutty
- Yes?
You go straight to
the Commissioner's office
They'll give you
an application form
You must fill it in capital letters
And they'll give you a letter
They'll call you
for police training
After you finish the training
become a higher official than me
Then boss me around
I will comply
Advising me is like teaching the musician
Chembai Vaidyanathan to sing?!
Nincompoop!
- How much?
- Rs 3, sir
Charges are high
But no coupons
I'm in traffic
When will you
return my money?
- Dude, I'm in traffic
- My money, dude
Idiot! I'm in traffic
Lord!
Beautiful girl
Excuse me?
I need to call my friend
Can I borrow your phone?
It's okay
I'm Manick
Hello? Matthew?
I'm Jeena here
Jeena, I saw you
But Loan shark Raja
was right next to you
So I was rooted to the spot
Top of it, your dad has complained
to the police that I've abducted you
Nonsense! I don't know
where all this will end
It's all my bad time!
Be brave
It will all be okay
Don't worry about
my dad's complaint
I'm there with you, no?
Stay at one of
your friends' place
After all this is over,
I'll come and take you home
Okay
Don't be stressed
Everything will be fine
by this evening
Okay
Bye
I will take the phone
like this and...!
Oh dear!
Thank you
It's okay
Well, I'm Manick
Malayali, right?
- What's your name?
- Jeena
"To live here
and to die here"
Is this eyes or magnet?
Jeena...you are very beautiful
Thanks...I'll g-
Huh...Jeena?
Go for a coffee-chat?
Excuse me
We are Malayalis
Let's chat over a cup of coffee
Where are you from?
Trissur or Kollam?
I'm sorry
I'm engaged
- You are busy?
- No, I'm committed
My wedding is fixed
It was only for
a coffee-chat!
Jeena!
"I float and fly way above
Softly silently from earth, my love"
"I'm buoyant...weightless
Like I'm on the moon's surface"
"100 dreams in your blue eyes innate
When they flutter to see me, I levitate"
"I float and fly way above
Softly silently from earth, my love"
"I move...weightless
Like I'm on the moon's surface"
"Like elusive dewdrops your words greet
and refresh me nectarine sweet"
"100 dreams in your blue eyes innate
When they flutter to see me, I levitate"
Church!?
'She has gone'
'3 hours left for 5:00 p.m'
- What can I get you, bro?
- Water
Why water...let me
serve you fruit juice?
Fresh papaya, mango, pomegranate
pineapple, sweet lime, apple, orange
Water melon, musk melon
I'll make fresh juice for you
Bro...shall I?
What a weird guy!
Wasted my time on him!
What can I get you?
All kinds of fruit juice
- Hello...?
- Where are you?
Mandaiveli
I'm in Mandaiveli too
Where in Mandaiveli?
Fruit shop
near the bus depot
Why are you in a juice shop
when it is lunch time?
Come straight to Royal hotel
We can eat while talking
Okay
'Born only to eat!'
On his way
Yes, sir?
What do you want to eat?
No...l don't-
1 mutton biriyani?
2 mutton Biriyani
1 bicken chilly
Chilly...chicken fry!
When I get hungry, my mouth
automatically blabbers!
Enough?
I'm planning to
start a new business
That's what I wanted
to discuss with you
Then...what about
your present business?
That was a good one
But it ran into loss
People in my town
started bad mouthing me
To make their jaw lines drop, I want
to start a business in a big way
I will explain everything later
Before that I want
Rs 50,000 urgently
By this evening
You have many
friends here, right?
It needn't be a loan
Remember, you owe me
the balance dowry...?
That's enough!
Only if my business
is good and I'm happy...
...can your sister be happy!
Only then, when you visit me
you can eat yummy biriyani!
Go ahead...eat
Sir, bill?
What's your tearing hurry?
I haven't finished eating and
you shove it down my nose?
Bring me a juice
- Sir, for you?
- Nothing
Pineapple juice
Sir, juice
Bill?
Sir, bill
Hey brother-in-law!
This is darn cheap here
Look?
I must meet a couple of guys
Shall we leave?
You carry on
I promised to
meet a friend here
I'll wait for him
Okay, I'll call you
after 5:00 p.m
Don't forget, my dear,
sharp 5:00 okay?
'464...!'
'Grinder...?'
'I can't grind batter!'
'Where is the exit door?'
'What if I just run out?'
- Bill...?
- I'll pay
'Lord! What will I do now?'
'Just run...that's it'
Hello...John?
Please come
to Royal hotel
It's near your office
Please, da?
I am there
Please come soon
What happened?
What the hell were
you doing...
...while he snatched
the money from you?
After you left Loan shark
barged into my office...
...and humiliated me
in front of everyone
Do you know
how disgraceful it was?
Like standing nude in
the middle of a church festival?!
I warn you, if you don't pay
both of us will be in trouble
And I will be the most harassed
'I'm lending the money with
your word as collateral' he said!
Matthew, I've done my best
to help you as a friend
Do what you want
I'm leaving
John...John!
I know there is absolutely
no use talking to you
I'm paranoid here with a knife pointed
at my throat...and you hog a gourmet meal!
My brother-in-law came
and ordered all this
I've been sitting here for half hour
not knowing what to do
I'm totally broke
Just this once
I'll somehow
repay you...please
Okay
This card isn't working
- Varkala (Town in Kerala)?
- Doesn't work!
- How much?
- 464
Where are all the coins?
ls there a hole in my pocket?!
Is it okay?
Look! You know Loan shark
Raja well, don't you?
I don't care what you do
Better pay him up by 5:00 pm
You can kill or
loot a bank or whatever
Come to my room
only after you pay him
Bro, I'll pay for this
in the evening, okay?
'I'll pay if my head
is not chopped off by Raja'
He isn't picking my call...that dog!
Give me your phone
No balance, bro
You can't make a call
Low balance
Shut up
Where's the button?
This is...tu...stuch screen
Touch screen
- How much?
- Rs 10,000
- Really?
- Yes, bro
You spent 10,000
and no button!
Dial
9-88-4-2
2-3-3-4-4
- Dialed?
- Dialed?!
Manick?
Loan shark Raja
A hot chick with you
makes you a hero or what?
We have your lover
Pay up and take her back
Which girl?
The one you were
drooling all over
I don't even know
who she is
She is not my love
I'm not a dumb ass
to believe your stories
What is he-
Pay up before 5:00 p.m
and take her back with you
I'm used to a meatless kuska
biriyani for just 10 bucks
She looks a spicy mutton biriyani
I hope you got what I said
Mr Raja...?
You dare dope yourself and
cook up some hare-brained scheme...
...I'll squeal to your bro
Please don't tell my brother
You know me very well, Manick
Don't mess with me
Hello...please
don't tell my brother
Here...your phone
She must be his lover!
'I must pay
Loan shark Raja'
'I must pick up Jeena'
'Before that, I must prove
her dad's complaint is false'
'Then I need to pay
that hog balance dowry'
'All this by 5:00 p.m today'
'If only experience was not
a criteria for all those job interviews...'
'...I won't be sitting here
like some roadside tramp!'
'My faith in God
is dwindling'
'2 jobs in this world
without experience'
'One is begging'
'The other is...snatching'
Please don't tell my brother
- Had tea?
- Yes, sir
Have you seen that girl?
No, sir
See properly
Don't try to show your
sleazy side and fraud ways...!
- I swear, sir
- Oh! Malayali?
After you took over
we've turned over a new leaf
You are a super hero, sir
Shall I tell you a story?
When I was in
my 2nd year of college
While ragging the juniors
I came across a beautiful girl
Anyone would fall for her
I was no exception
I decided then and there
I'd marry only her
I stood on my head
and got her all to myself
We dated for 3 years
Then came this guy from Dubai
She just dumped me
and went after him
To get herself a better deal
She ditched me
Are you also
treating me like that?
My dear chap! Don't try
your tricks with me
After you took charge we don't do
such nefarious activities, sir
You are after all
this city's hero, sir
Isn't that what
he just said in Malayalam?
Constable, lock them
all up in 1 single cell
Let them think peacefully
You are in that cell, sir
Put them somewhere, dude!
Johnnykutty wants to talk to you
Johnnykutty, I am enquiring
your case right now
If I get news
I will inform you, okay?
I'll...call-
Whether they earn or not
they all have a credit card!
Won't you check this
before you snatch?!
Yeah, go and ask 'sir,
do you have card or cash'?!
Trying to escape,
a bullet grazes his throat!
Why won't you talk?
Why get riled?
I was just making fun
Gold covering?!
What's this?
My mother always says
before doing something good-
Eat a sweet
Go to the temple
As I was going
to the temple-
- Temple...?!
- I was walking near a temple
One idiot was counting money
in the middle of the road
I walked past him
Just at that time, he got
a call from some rogue
He picked the call
I picked his cash!
He chased me
with such vigor
Thank God
you came at that time
How did you land up there?
Nancy called me up to say
her husband was not at home
I was on my way to see her
I suddenly see you
rolling on the road with him
I knew if it was you
some cash would be involved
I called Fernandez
to bring his auto
And helped you escape
50000 bucks
Instead of such paltry amounts
we should deal with a lump sum
I'm also thinking
the same way
I have a plan
Whaaat?
When?
Where?
Which hospital?
Okay...start the car
What happened, bro?
Accident while I was
crossing the road
If that auto had hit me
I'd be dead by now
This was the guy who saved me
in the nick of the moment
Me...?
This boy?
Thank you
What's your name?
Matthew
Do you know when
my brother was born?
When my elder brother had
a son, he was born to my parents
I brought him up
like my own son
I made sure he never
missed our parents
Dress...food...music
There he goes!
Even now he sleeps
only if I sing
It's a childhood habit
My son, you must be
in terrible pain...?
Don't worry
You go to sleep
I'll sing for you
"Hari...
Murali..."
Did you get the number
of the auto that banged him?
TN 07
T 5305
Call Ukken?
- Which Ukken?
- Our Sub Inspector
Yes, bro
An auto driver hit
my brother and escaped
In the next half hour, the driver
and owner must be here before me
My boys will
tell you the rest
Tell him
Do you know
the number?
Yes, sir
Okay, tell me
TN 07
T 5305
Where do you work?
I am hunting for a job
What have you studied?
B.E Computer science
I see
Why didn't you try for a job
in my company?
Your company name, sir?
Company name...?
Sir, I had come
But since I didn't have
the required experiance-
Who asked?
Not us
Some experience is necessary
What do you know
in computers?
I know Basic COBOL, C, C++,
Photoshop...l know all this, sir
Do you know
to write a CD?
I know even
to write a DVD
Then you have experience
Come to my company
I'll tell my wife about you
- Can you...help me?
- What?
Is anyone related
to the patient here?
'A girl voice'
He has an older brother
- Who is that?
- I am here
Doctor wants to see you
- Tell him I'll come
- I will
'She has left?'
Matthew, be here with my brother
I'll see the doctor and be back
We found the auto driver
He lives in my neighborhood
Start the vehicle
- Sir! What about this?
- Leave it there
What's the time now?
Almost 5:00
- Correct time?
- 4:58
Loan shark Raja: 'You have
time only till 5 this evening'
Loan shark Raja:
'Capital + interest'
Loan shark Raja: 'Pay up before
5:00 p.m and take her back with you'
Loan shark Raja:
'...or I'll squeal to your bro'
John: 'You know well
about Loan shark Raja'
John: 'Pay him up at 5:00 p.m
and then come to my room'
Jiju: 'Give me 50,000 bucks
by this evening'
Ukken: 'You had better land up here,
at 5:00 p.m with that girl'
Jiju: 'I'll call you after 5:00'
Loan shark Raja:
'One point...'
Loan shark Raja: 'You have time
only till 5 this evening'
Loan shark Raja:
'If there's a mess up...'
Loan shark Raja:
'No other option'
What happened to you?
Accident while I was
crossing the road
If that auto had hit me
I'd be dead by now
This was the guy who saved me
in the nick of the moment
I'm quite fed up of him
What's your name?
Johnnykutty, we are
hunting for your daughter
No need to be worried
We will find
Jeena for you
You don't need to
call us repeatedly
Some idiot has kidnapped
this fool's daughter!
If I get hold of him...
...I'll strangle him from 'sa' to 'pa' and
punch his 'ma' like off key notes of a song!
He is the sole person
for all my troubles
To every fool who complains
why do you give my mobile number?
You were the one who-
Not us
Not me, sir
What is your name?
Ukka? What happened
to our complaint?
We found the auto owner
He is outside
What's his name?
Loan shark Raja, sir
- What's his name?
- That Shylock!
You handle this matter
Why me, sir?
You can do it yourself
You don't know about me
I might even kill him
- Why me, sir?
- Come with me
You can-
You can't refuse
Come with me
Go
Make sure I don't lose my cool
Loan shark Raja
What's this, man?
Owner knocked out
It was an accident
Is he dead?
'I wanted to kill him'
Wipe it off your face
Drooling all over!
When are you
planning to get married?
We'll repay what we borrowed
from you and then get married
Yes, bro
Vetri, Manick, Matthew,
Pushkar...then who?
Light house
Instead of such paltry amounts
we should deal with a lump sum
I'm also thinking
the same way
I have a plan
Hello?
Light house?
Money is ready, bro
Shall I come
to your place?
Come, bro
I'm here
On the way
Start the car, let's go
to Light house's place
No...let me drive
We'll carry out our plan
properly and then escape
Okay
Careful...that Shylock
is on his way here
Your good time, Light house
You paid up in time
You know me inside out, no?
Next month, same way, I must
get the interest on the dot
Okay, bro
Car...bro...go
Catch him
Run, you dumbos
Catch him
Stop the car!
Bro...aiyo!
Don't let him go
Climb up, bro
You can...bro
Climb up for God's sake
Super
That's the way
Listen to me carefully
I'll hand over the cash
to Loan shark Raja
Kalan will take the car
Raja will turn back
In that split second, you should
grab the money from his hand
Okay?
Got it?
What did you understand?
I'll grab the car
He'll grab the money
Right?
What will you do?
Tell me
Wait
Hey moron!
Listen to me
with all ears
Me Kalan
- Huh?
- Gawd!!!
Me, Light house
Kalan
I'll give the money
to Loan shark Raja
Kalan will grab the car
Loan shark Raja will turn back
In that split second, you should
grab the money from his hand
Got it?
Why are you paying him?
Oh! I get it, he knows you
but doesn't know me
We'll get back
the money we give him
But Fernandez...even if timing
gets missed a little...
...I'll escape
You'll be in a soup
If I get caught...?
You are dead meat!
Understood?

Drive carefully
He's dead!
Toe my line
You are a doll!
I'll never forget this favor
Thanks, bro
Road belongs to my dad
Whoever comes in the way,
trash him and keep driving!
Get lost!
Yov! Move aside
Move...move
What are you crowding
around for?
His bad time, bro
He got banged in
his vulnerable spot!
He breathed his last!
Jesus Christ!
Move...move aside
I'm sorry
He's no more
He didn't die
an easy death
I killed him
You stand in a mortuary
and check his pulse?!
Mortuary?
Are you really
a doctor?
Bald headed idiot!
Ukka...file this as 'ascident'
and close the case
I want this city to know
I killed Loan shark Raja
- Got it?
- Yes, bro
Sir, I'll leave now
Matthew, you wanted
a favor from me?
I don't think
it is needed anymore
You can join work tomorrow
Thank you, sir
What's your name?
- Matthew
- Go
I called you this
morning, didn't I?
No, sir
Ukka, he is our company staff
- Your company staff?
- Then what?
Okay, go
Mr Johnnykutty
You promised to find me
my daughter by evening
We've sent photos to
all the police stations
I will let you know
as soon as I get information
I am Jeena's mother speaking
Tell me
Don't listen to this man and flash
my daughter's snap all over the place
She went with him willingly
This man agreed to
get them married
As soon as he knew
that boy lost his job...
...this man broke his promise
and found another groom
That's why she ran away
Like an idiot, don't listen to
this man and waste your time
- What is your name?
- It's a nice name!
What, sir?
I didn't hear you
Tintu (Little Johnny)
I have nothing
more to say
Tintu?
Who was it on the line?
Chief Minister
Oh yeah!
I heard something
about a photo, eh?
Mahatma Gandhi's photo...
- Wall?
- Aah...to hang on the wall
Let me take leave now
Yov! Come, let's go
Tintu...?
Give the Chief minister...my regards
Who is the present Chief minister?!
Not us
I am the one who knows
all the people he lent money to
lam the only one who knows
whose wife and whose money we took!
Hey! Dumbbell
Name and address of-
Please carry on
I am his successor
Loan shark Blackie...that's me
Dai! What are you looking at?
This watch?
As if I have
something special
Go...take care!
What do I have
that you don't?!
What are you
gawking for?!
Some chap hit me
You are bleeding
Who hit you?
I don't know
Just come
That's him
Hey! You...!
Jeena...?!!
Matthew...!
I asked you to wait for me
in your friend's house?!
What are you doing
in the boot of a car?
Get lost, da!
Let's go?
Was this girl
all along in the car?!
Jeena...
Leave me
Look! My gold chain
He was the one
this morning...
Let's go
Brother-in-law! You called
at the right time
I just got the money
from my friends
Where are you now?
Okay
'How did Loan shark Raja die?'
'Why did he kidnap Jeena?'
'How did I see those
thieving scumbags?'
'Why didn't the sub-inspector
recognize me...'
'How I landed up
with a job...'
'How did all this
happen in 1 single day?'
'In spite of all these
unanswered questions...'
'...if I can happily smoke
and hug my girl friend'
'...I'm reminded of what
someone somewhere remarked'
'TIME'
'There are 2 types of time'
'Good time and bad time'
'Good time always
follows bad time'
