Rakesh Suri, very good.
92%.
Shankar Prakash, 95%.
Umesh Bhairav.
Excellent. 97%.
And finally we'll hear Student of the Year's marks...
who failed for just two numbers.
Shrinath Prasad...
Whenever its result time...
he always runs off to the bathroom.
But... - Sir.
Bhai says, "Do me a favor that, don't ever do me any favor".
But I say do me a favor.
Please give me two more marks, sir.
Shankar and Loy have done me a favor.
By making me proud.
Shankar's going to join IPS.
Loy will join IAS.
- Thank you sir.
And Roshan is going to IIM.
Sir, I am going to IPL.
You're not going anywhere.
You're going to stay right here with me, in this class.
Because your antics, dog's tail...
..and Katrina's Hindi can never straighten up.
Sir, these days she speaks better Hindi.
Get out of my class.
- What, sir?
I said get out of my class.
Sir, I...
That's my paper, sir.
First you fail me and then forget.
Go ahead.
Tripathi, there can't be a better auspicious occasion...
for your daughter's marriage.
 - Yes.
Even God can't stop this marriage.
- Yes.
Excuse me.
Sir, come here.
Excuse me.
Come here.
Come, Come..
Why are you whispering in my ears?
You don't need to hide this from the people.
Shinu abducted my daughter!
Don't take it personally.
But your father Tripathi will never change.
For just two marks...
he didn't just sc*** my future, but yours too.
Bappa!
Just like You wanted, I abducted Tripathi's daughter.
Will he pass me now?
Bow to Him!
I never said this.
Look, Shinu, don't make me your partner in crime.
You know there are just three things in life I love.
What?
 - On television, Amit sir's Crorepati
In Tennis, Mahesh Bhupati.
And in Gods, my dear Lord Ganpati.
Thank you.
People butter me...
but you always fool me.
No Bappa.
- Shinu!
Bye Bappa, I'll catch you later.
Okay bye see you take care.
I hope no God ever gets a useless devotee like you.
Hey come here.
Shinu.
Son. Let my daughter go.
Tripathi sir, just give me two more marks.
As soon as I pass, she'll be with her papa.
Tripathi, sir.
Prasad.
Prasad, your son kidnapped my daughter...
from her wedding.
I see, very good.
- Come on.
Prasad, my daughter.
- Oh yes.
What did you eat when he was in your womb?
Whatever it was, you fed it to me.
Shinu, open the door.
My son, open the door.
My son... He won't listen so affectionately.
Hold this.
Shinu, open the door, son...
otherwise I'll abdicate you from my will.
Now you learnt your lesson.
- Relax.
My daughter.
 - Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
This is my glasses.
My daughter.
Sorry, dear.
 - Dad.
Sorry, dear.
- Dad.
Sir, sir.
Sir come, come, come.
You don't need to hide this from everyone...
and whisper it in my ears.
The groom's family ran away.
Who will marry my daughter now?
Tell Shinu to marry her.
Tell Shinu to marry her!
Shinu.
Marry her.
No.
- Well, you had to get married one day.
And she's the professor's daughter.
He'll pass you next year.
Yes.
Take him away.
- Go on.
Dad.
'She's so fat, if she stands on the weighing scale...'
'...it will only show 'To Be Continued'.
Srinath Prasad, you're not so unlucky.
I am not so unlucky...
that I've to marry this duffer, papa.
Come on, son.
Eat your dinner, it'll get cold.
Not fair, mom.
I did so well in my exams.
I wrote three page long answers for every question.
But still Tripathi failed me.
I am sure your answers must be right.
But his questions must be wrong.
- Yes.
Yes.
Pass me that bread.
 - Yes.
You know Verma's son...
went to Bangalore to complete his studies.
And Shinde's son went to Pune.
We're so fortunate.
Our son doesn't leave us and go anywhere.
And day before yesterday...
our servant left the job to complete his degree.
Here, son.
From tomorrow morning be at the shop.
I will not come to the shop.
I will go to Bangalore.
And get a degree there.
Degree?
- Degree?
Bengaluru isn't that way, son.
It's this way.
I am going to the toilet.
He won't get a degree...
instead he'll give us third degree.
Mama, pa, see my popularity.
The entire city's here to bid goodbye.
Son, goodbyes are given with just one hand.
Take a closer look.
They're waving both their hands.
That means don't come back.
They're feeling so good in saying bye.
Now that you're leaving...
don't return until you achieve something.
Go on.
Eat on time.
"Come to me."
"Come to me."
Here I am.
Hi. Hi. Hi.
Girls, this is my seat...
- Hello.
Don't try to get too friendly.
Go and sit on your seat.
Excuse me, this is my seat.
Uncle - Tell me son..
I am joining the IPS for such hoodlums.
I'll get rid of them...
and protect Mother India and her daughters.
Excuse me, wherever we sit that seat belongs to us.
Yes, but... - So please sit somewhere else.
Listen...
 - U-turn.
Go.
Am I your touch-screen phone...
that you're constantly touching me.
Sorry.
Come on, girls.
How about you play a round with us too?
But it's important to drink before you sing.
They were getting Ranbir Kapoor...
but I guess they're destined for Shakti Kapoor.
Baby, have some.
Weren't you going to kill me...
and protect the daughters of India.
Don't look now, but goons are misbehaving with girls.
Go on, what's stopping you?
Hey, hero.
I was waiting for that dialogue to beat you up.
Uncle, will you please hold my jacket.
Tell him about me.
Do you know who Babu is?
Who Babu's father is.
Who Babu's brother...
- I'm going to beat up your Babu...
that he'll never beget a baba or a baby.
"I am bad."
Should I hit you on the face or the chest?
Hit you on the face...
- Hit hard.
"I am bad."
You'll have to pay for it dearly.
- That's okay.
I hate cheap things anyway.
Out!
Out!
Out!
Go.
- Thank you so much.
It's okay.
This was...
Can I have my seat now?
I'll get my jacket.
Uncle.
Shinu, my brother.
Even Dennis is not such a menace compared to you.
I remember, it was a Saturday...
when you entered my life as bad luck.
I came to Bangalore from Ooty only to escape you.
But I pray every day.
Send beggars to my house.
Send illness in my body.
But never you.
I guess that's a beggar.
Aren't you happy to see me?
I am very happy.
I was just thinking about you.
I swear.
- Very good.
I took admission in your college.
And do you know what the good news is?
- What?
I'll be living in your house with you.
But bro, you'll be living for a few days, right?
Are you crazy?
Few days?
I'm here to get a degree.
I can't leave until I don't pass.
That means you'll never leave.
Right now I'll go take a bath.
- What are you doing?
Let go of my underwear.
Where's the bathroom?
- Straight and right.
I hope it's clean.
- Yes.
From today even kids will say...
"Mom, I want to study in the same college as Shinu".
Oh no, he's seen me.
Lord Krishna, here.
So, You followed me to Bangalore as well.
I am God.
From Powai to Hawaii, you'll find me everywhere.
You know I love only three songs.
Raj Kapoor's "Rammaiyya Vastavaiyya".
Bappi Da's "Ta Thaiyya-thiayya".
 - I see.
"Bada Nathkhat hai Yeh Kishan Kanhaiyya."
- That's my song.
You forgot, I am the original butter stealer.
Don't try to butter me.
God, I've decided.
- What?
This time I will concentrate on my studies.
- Good.
And help me score at least 90%...
- 90%!
Fine, at least get me pass marks.
And keep me away from every attraction and distraction.
Okay.
I mean... girls.
- I'll try.
Shinu look at her.
She's not bad.
Lord, I came here to get a degree...
but You sent me after girls, just like You.
But the problem is, when You do it it's Divine play.
But if I do it, I'm a Casanova.
OMG.
You blessed me by dropping this flower.
Too much.
'Duffer, the breeze was strong...'
'...that's why the flower fell down.'
Where is she?
Where is she?
Where is she?
Hey, my name is Shinu.
Full name, Srinath Prasad.
Actually, this is a new college, new city...
so when I saw you, I felt I should make new friends.
If you don't mind, can you show me around your campus?
I can show you... my campus.
- Nice try.
But it's much more fun if she shows me, not you.
Nice try, but she isn't interested in showing anyone anything.
Come on.
Why does your jealous friend always interfere...
whenever I try to talk to you?
Oh...
Barfi...
The boy's crazy, but he's cute.
Turn around!
Turn around!
Turn around!
Bro, what are you doing?
- Why?
Do you know who you're flirting with?
You're my friend, aren't you?
So she's your future sister-in-law.
There are 200 girls in this college.
 - Yes.
And you had to like her.
Sunaina's the entire college's sister-in-law.
Just think... Brad and Angelina.
Brangilina.
Sunaina and Shinu.
Sunainu.
Sunainu!
Stop dreaming.
She's Angad Negi's future wife.
Who is Angad Negi?
Anger is one of the most destructive emotions.
Especially in a relationship.
A cat scratches in a fit of rage.
A donkey kicks.
Angad's a kind of an animal.
In fact, he even looks like one.
What do you think?
What animal does Angad look like?
I feel like Angad looks like a scavenger.
I feel Angad looks like a stray dog.
He does everything openly.
What happened, Angad?
Aren't you feeling angry today?
No doctor, I am miles away from anger.
Are you sure?
Doctor if I was angry, you wouldn't be alive to ask the next question.
Good control, Angad.
Good control.
Excellent.
- Thank you.
Angad, today's your last class...
so before you go, just want to ask you few questions.
Do you still love Sunaina?
 - Knock-knock.
Knock-knock.
Who is it?
 - Sunaina.
Sunaina who?
- I don't know either.
Brilliant. Brilliant.
See... this is how you deal with it.
I am so proud of you.
You can be Angad too.
See just look at him.
Your friendship cost me dearly too.
No boy ever flirts or talks to me.
Sorry.
Hi. - Bye.
Beat it..beat it..just beat it..
Hi, I am Hari. I am a new student.
If you don't mind, can I sit here?
Mom!
What are you doing, Angad?
If you keep doing this, it will only spoil your relation.
Sister-in-law.
Look, Sunaina, don't be scared.
I am trying to be a better person.
For your sake I even attended anger management classes.
But, just like in chess...
if the pawns get a chance to meet the queen...
then it only ruins the game, sister-in-law.
"Just beat it."
"Beat it."
Knock-knock!
Knock-knock!
- Who is it?
Who is it?
AG.
Who is AG?
Who is AG?
Hear me clearly.
If anyone sits with Sunaina, he's gone for good.
Bro, why are you looking so confused?
Just sit anywhere.
After today, I won't even sit at my dining table.
What's wrong with him?
From Drunk driving to vandalism...
Angad saved you from every case.
And in return, all he asked for...
was to keep an eye on sister-in-law Sunaina.
Take off your glasses.
After today no boy should befriend Sunaina.
The line's clich? but the emotion's real.
Do you want to make friendship with me?
Class, canteen or library...
no boy should be sitting with her.
I want to study with you in the classroom.
Eat with you in the canteen.
And peek in your books in the library.
Spread so much terror around...
that no one dares to press the send button...
to send a message to Sunaina.
I want to text you, mail you, Tweet you, Skype you.
And if you still don't reply, I'll poke you.
On Facebook.
Brother Angad come fast.
Hey, mom.
Pardon me, but I forgot.
My mother sent this for you, from Meerut.
Just arrived from Agra.
Their traditional dress.
I don't know about a degree, mom...
but I will certainly bring back a girl.
Bye.
I've told my mother about you.
I swear on my mother's beans...
I will win your heart in Bangalore...
we'll get married in Ooty...
and honeymoon in Goa.
He's quite low-budget.
- Shut up.
You scare me more than Angad.
Let's go, Esha.
Sunaina, we can even go to Australia.
New Zealand.
Kenya. No, that isn't nice.
Wherever you want to go.
"Since I saw you I am completely shaken."
"Feels like my heart jumped out."
"Since I saw you I am completely shaken."
"Feels like my heart jumped out."
"I'll take you to see my mom and dad."
"Everything I say you think is wrong."
"Turn around."
"Where are you looking?"
"Your hero's right here."
"Where are you looking?"

"Where no one can cast an eye on us."
"Everything I say you think is wrong."
"Turn around."
"Where are you looking?"
"Your hero's right here."
"Where are you looking?"

"Why does the world say to me?"
"It's not easy to get you."
"I'll endure your attitude."
"I swear on you... I'll hang the moon outside your window."
"I can hang my heart... outside your dress."
"Everything I say you think is wrong."
"Turn around."
"Where are you looking?"
"Your hero's right here."
"Where are you looking?"
"Your hero's right here."
"Where are you looking?"
"Your hero's right here."
"So turn around."
"Do you know?"
"Your hero's right here."
"Where are you looking?"
"Your hero's right here."
"Where are you looking?"
"Your hero's right here."
Shinu stop.
What happened.
- Where are you going?
Angad Negi's boys are looking for you.
- Me?
Yes.
But what did I do?
Run!
Wow!
I never imagined our first date will be in a classroom.
Shinu, I am no normal girl you can win over.
If you don't stop following me...
then you'll definitely die in Bangalore.
Your body will be cremated in Ooty...
and Angad will immerse your ashes in Goa's sea.
Why are you so scared of Angad?
Lodge a complaint with the police.
Do you know who Angad is?
Maybe I was unfortunate...
that one day this hassle came till my house.
I think it's the driver.
- Yes.
I'll be right there.
Hello.
Hello, aunty, Angad Negi.
Your friendly neighborhood policeman.
Sari for you.
Hey.
Sister-in-law Sunaina looks just like her mom.
Who are you, and what you want?
Uncle.
Hello, uncle.
This suit-piece is for you.
It's Raymond.
- Because everybody loves Raymond.
Give sweets to everyone.
 - Yes.
Elders say after you eat something sweet..
It's difficult to say harsh words.
Sir, this is my horoscope.
Don't worry.
 Now that our hearts have matched...
so will our horoscopes.
They have.
Sister-in-law, hello.
Sunaina.
After all, I am deeply in love with Sunaina.
Let's take a picture.
Brother, sister-in-law, let's take a picture.
Come to closer.
Smile please.
Smile come on.
Give each other a hug.
You two are going to be together...
Stop it.
Dad.
How dare you?
Barge in my house and dare...
to speak about marrying my daughter.
Let's make one thing clear.
My daughter doesn't like you.
I am a respectable citizen of this country.
My taxes pay for your salary.
And if you ever look at my daughter again...
then I will complain to your seniors.
Brother, don't get furious.
Don't get furious.
Don't get furious.
Calm down.
 Calm down.
I am not getting angry.
I am not angry.
He's like my father.
I am sorry, sir.
He said sorry to you.
Let's shake hands and forget all grievances.
Shake hands, uncle.

What did you do, uncle?
You shot a policeman.
Peter, for how long will he be jailed?
By the time he comes out...
your children will call us uncle.
Peter, knock-knock.
Who is it? - Scapegoat.
Scapegoat, who?
- Him, the one who's trapped.
Daddy, the decision is in your hands.
Either you go to jail for this bullet...
or Sunaina comes to my home.
If anyone sees us together...
- Don't worry.
Just be calm and have faith in Shinu.
You know what, whether you live or die...
I really don't care.
You know what?
Whether I live or die...
I think you do care.
Don't just stand here...
with hockey in your hands and jockeys in your pant.
Let your sister-in-law go.
Sister-in-law?
She's your sister-in-law, don't stare.
Where is he?

Guys, I am not in the mood right now.
Please come back some other time.
What mood?
Look, we borrowed these hockey sticks...
and baseball bats from other students.
We cannot return them without using it.
I see, is that so?
Then I'll give you three options.
I'll bash the first one.
Thrash the second one.
And I'll thrash the third one, put him back together...
and bash him again.
That's my favorite.
Vicky.
Giri.
Goldie.
Now for the thrashing.
No. 2.
Now for the 3rd, my favorite.
Goldie.
"I am bad."
Don't push.
Didn't you hear what he said?
I'll bash the first one.
Thrash the second.
And I'll thrash the third one, put him back together...
and bash him again.
That's his favorite, you go.
What are you doing?
Hurry up, I am getting late for class.
I've three options.
First, I'll run.
Second, I'll run faster.
And third... That one's my favorite.
I'll disappear in thin air.
Tell me name.
- Sir, his name's Shinu.
Full name, Srinath Prasad.
Sir, I came to Bangalore to study.
Actually what happened is I entered college at 9am.
At 9:05 I met lord Krishna.
And 5 minutes later he introduced me to Sunaina.
So it's not my fault.
Continue.
Sir, I followed her around the campus...
like the doggie in the mobile network ad.
I even sung a song for her like AR Rehman's jingle.
But when I found out that...
this prepaid card has already been registered...
in the name of Inspector Angad Negi.
I stepped back, sir.
I don't want relations, sir.
He followed Sunaina like a doggie.
He even sung a song.
You didn't tell me.
Sir, actually I am from a nice family.
See you. Peace.
You think Sunaina has the guts...
too fall in love with someone else?
If a girl truly loves a boy...
then she won't be scared.
And if a boy really loves a girl...
then doesn't really make a difference...
whether she's the Minister's daughter...
or some Police inspector's girlfriend.
All the best.
I'll give you one chance.
Try to win Sunaina's heart.
Me?
I came here to study, sir.
And half the college loves Sunaina...
anyone will accept it.
No, no.
You will do it.
Only you.
"I am bad."
By the way, sir, I believe that 99.99%...
she will definitely fall for me.
And in just three days.
But for those three days better tell these scoundrels...
"The flowers and the stars have to say."
"For the next three days Sunaina's only mine."
If you don't mind, I mean...
Sir.
Angad, this boy's a rascal.
What if he wins over sister-in-law?
Angad, I forgot to tell you one thing.
- What?
Taking Sunaina around, to the movies...
buying her coke, taking her to a disco 9-12...
will cost money.
"I am bad."
She's your girl so you'll have to pay for it as well.
Yes, that's true.
After all it's the question of sister-in-law's comfort level.
Think of it as loose-change.
You've a big heart.
I've small expenses.
Don't forget to pray for me.
I am your younger brother.
Peter, knock-knock.
Knock-knock who?
 - GK.
GK who?
What's the point of this boy's life?
For the sake of teaching Sunaina a lesson...
he will have to die.
Shinu?
Hello coward.
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
"Dil jumping japak jumpak-jumpak."
What are you doing?
By the way, do you celebrate Diwali at home every day?
Why?
- Why are you so scared?
You're scared of Angad.
You're scared of his cronies.
I am not scared of anyone.
Hello, uncle.
You're even scared of your dad.
Look, please go before mom-dad come here.
Mom and dad are at home?
Then, mom-dad... Shinu's coming.
- Shinu, please.
Nice room.
Wow.
- Shinu stop it.
Double-spring multipurpose mattress.
Daddy's spent well.
Oh, your cheeks were better when you were a kid.
But you've better legs now.
Shinu, please leave.
 - Okay.
Not that way.
Shinu please stop
I am ready to do anything.
Anything?
What are you doing?
- Anything.
What are you doing?
- You said anything.
What are you doing?
Sometimes you say I've better legs, sometimes...
I don't get you.
If you want to understand...
then come to CCD tomorrow, okay?
Okay.
Bye.
Hi uncle.
 Aunty.
I came to show Sunaina my six-pack abs.
Okay, bye.
So did you go to CCD in the morning?
- No way.
The further I stay from Shinu the better.
You might stay away but he's coming closer.
You made a big mistake not coming to CCD.
Now I'm going to say it publicly.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Found it.
I love you!
Didn't you hear?
I...love... you!
You can take all the time you want to reply.
Day, 1 day, 2 days, 2 days...
but maximum 3 days.
Today you're scared of Angad.
Tomorrow it may be someone else.
The more you fear them...
the more they'll scare you.
Nice catch.
What?
What are you staring at?
Hit me.
Hit me. Hit me.
You dogs, remember your boss' instructions.
For three days you can watch, bark but no biting.
Move!
Bro, sister-in-law's slipped from our hands.
Shut up!
How many would you give her?
4 on 10.
8 on 10.
I'll give her minus.
Losers!
How much for me?
- Number?
4 for Gauri, minus points for Isha.
We just...
- He got it.
Don't interfere.
You say.
- 10 out of 10.
You're giving number to sister-in-law.
Don't you dare call me sister-in-law.
Learn to respect women, not disrespect her.
Whether she's of any shape, size or color.
Got it. - Yes.
Indian woman... wreaked havoc on Angad's crony.
Go on. - Should I?
Don't be scared, go.
Well done.
What are you doing? Everyone's watching.
Coward, let them watch if they want.
And I am not a coward.
"The sickness of honesty..."
"Forsake the sickness of honesty and come to me."
"Come running to me."

Where's Srinath Prasad?
He retired from the cricket team long back.
He must be in the commentary box now, sir.
Sir...
There he is.
Why do you want to sacrifice your life for your friend?
Where is he?
I saw him in the theatre yesterday with Sunaina.
They were sitting on the same seat and watching a movie.
Sister-in-law on Shinu's lap.
The matter's out of hand.
Sir, I am not your level.
Please, put me down. Please, leave me.
Yes tell me, where are you?
How did they disappear?
What's the point in helping you.
Search them everywhere.
They must be somewhere.
Come on, Dhoni.
We need a six.
We need a helicopter shot.
What a shot, Dhoni.
What a shot.
Come on.
Angad.
Why did I come here?
Why? Why?
Why?
Oh yes.
Sunaina's fallen in love with me.
Actually... she's deeply in love with me.
Brother, that's your kind of love.
Look, she's calling.
Hello, sister-in-law.
Hello.
- What's my baby doing?
She called him baby?
- Sunaina.
Actually, I want to hear you say those lovely three words.
Baby.
Shinu called her baby.
I can hear that too.
Say it, Sunaina.
How many times do I say it?
I love you, Shinu.
Listen, with a bit more feeling...
and stress on "Love".
I love you...
You're killing me.
Can't take it.
One more. Last.
Now a sweet, soft, strawberry flavored...
Shinu wants to eat ice-cream.
After that you need prayers.
I am coming.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
Peter, find yourself another sister-in-law.
Negi sir, bye.
- Enjoy it.
Lovedale Street, House No. 24, Ooty.
Your mother teaches small children...
at Little Angel school and your father...
runs the only supermarket in Ooty.
Right?
You know my home's geography...
you know my parent's biography.
But unfortunately... you didn't find out my entire history.
Since I was a kid I was thrown out of 15 schools.
10 police officers even took transfer because of me.
And few MLAs even deserted their post because of me.
When I was leaving city...
the entire city came to bid me farewell.
I look sweet, innocent.
But actually, I am a big rascal.
"I am bad."
And Angad, if you ever think about...
my mom-dad or Sunaina, then...
I'll catch the next train to Meerut.
I'll go to alley no 14, house no 12...
touch your mother's feet and say...
Aunt, please forgive me.
Because I am going to make your son's plight...
same as Sachin and Sehwag did to Pakistan in 2003 World Cup.
Right, brother.
They both played so well.
Shinu!
So you've finally shown your true colors, Angad.
First you trapped Sunaina's dad...
by shooting Peter.
Today you're trapping Peter by shooting me.
It's always Peter who's trapped. Right, Peter?
- Yes, he's right.
Move, Peter.
Turn your gun to the other side.
- Come on shoot.
Control, Peter, control.
To hell with control, turn the gun around.
Shoot.
- Peter, move.
Angad, this won't do.
- Come on shoot.
Peter, move.
Peter, move.
Shoot.
Peter, move.
Come on shoot.
Don't shoot.
Peter.
Angad, you shot me again.
Peter, I told you to move.
Sir, what's going on here...
Sir...
How did you enter my house?
Wait. Please...
Sir...
Knock-knock.
Knock-knock, Peter.
- Who is it?
Scapegoat.
- Scapegoat who?
The one that got trapped.
"I am bad."
"I am bad."
"I am bad."
Wow, my hero.
I am no hero, I am just an ordinary boy.
You got Angad suspended.
- Yes.
Showed my mom-dad your six packs.
- Yes.
But how did you do it?
"Nothing's gonna change my love for you."
"You ought to know that by now that I love you."
"One thing you can be sure of."
"Nothing's gonna change my love for you."
Shinu!
Shinu!
Shinu!
Help!
Shinu!
Shinu!
Sunaina!
Shinu!
My leg..
Shinu.
- Sunaina!
Shinu!
Sunaina
Sunaina
Hello, Shinu.
Not Shinu.
Full name Srinath Prasad.
Angad, where's Sunaina?
What do you think I abducted Sunaina?
Helicopters are not my budget.
His power and budget is limited on the ground.
Peter, shut up.
Angad just tell me where's Sunaina.
Remember, few months ago...
during the Ooty to Bangalore train-ride...
Do you know who's Babu?
Who Babu's father is?
Who Babu's brother is?
Not him, stupid.
There was someone else on that train...
who was floored by your punch lines and punches.
I wonder why?
This will cost you dearly.
 - Fine.
Anyway, Shinu doesn't like cheap things.
Get out!
That day on that train your fate changed.
Ayesha Singhal fell in love with you.
Do you know who her father is?
Vikrant Singhal.
Asia and Africa's biggest gangster.
The world's helpless in front of him...
but he has just one weakness.
His daughter, Ayesha.
Vikrant's men came to us looking for you.
We said Shinu's a rascal.
You can't get your hands on him so easily.
But if you take Sunaina...
then he'll follow you like the mobile network's dog...
singing AR Rehman's jingle.
Hey...
Son, you've two options.
Either go to Bangkok and marry Ayesha.
Or face Vikrant's bullet.
Peter knock-knock.
Knock-knock who?
Pop. - Pop who?
We'll enjoy the popcorn now.
There's a twist in the story now.
Come on.
Let's go.
Eat some popcorn, and get healthy,
"Where are you looking?
Your hero's right here."
"Where are you looking?
Your hero's right here."
Jesus, you here.
Ganpati and Krishna have told me everything about you.
And your slam-bang tactics won't work here.
Look, there's difficulty ahead.
But these difficulties can be solved only with love.
So take your love away with love and not violence.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
- Ali sir, that boy has arrived from India.
Greet him, boys.
Greet him. - Okay.
Daddy, he's come.
Welcome, son-in-law.
 Welcome.
I was wondering what made Ayesha crazy about you.
Now I realized that she saw the same thing..
..her mother saw in me years ago.
Just like every coke isn't cola..
..every chickpeas can't be made into a curry.
Similarly, not every innocent looking boy is nave.
Balli darling, do you want cola or chickpeas?
Vikrant bhai, forget the words understand the emotion.
Emotions.
Shinu.
You think I am a kid.
You think I can't take Sunaina away.
Sir..
I hail from a small city like Ooty.
And every Indian who doesn't get a chance..
..to be born in the Tata's or the Ambani's family..
..dream for an opportunity to win over their daughter.
The groom is ready, sir.
Where's the bride?
I like him.
I like him.
I like my son-in-law.
Even I like her, what a beauty.
I like you.
My lady.
She's my sister-in-law.
- Sister-in-law.
Vikrant's girlfriend.
- Okay.
Veronica.
Calm down, Balli.
Everyone makes this mistake.
Viki darling, I missed you.
- I missed you too.
But sir where is the Ayesha, mother.
Mummy.
Ayesha's mother..
When Ayesha was four, her mother and my first wife passed away..
..and since them I am a widower.
Widower.
Widower. Widower.
Sir, why do you..
- What do you mean?
You mean.. - Balli darling.
Vikrant was born in the valleys of Manali.
So often his voice echoes.
Son, whenever you miss your mother..
..you can come to me.
Shower me with your affection..
Don't ever do that.
But there's a small problem.
Sunaina.
Sir, middle-class girls should be left in the middle.
Smart boy.
You're marrying my daughter tomorrow, got it.
I don't care.
Father-in-law, give me 10 days.
So that I can get to know Ayesha. Bonding.
Son-in-law, the wedding's tomorrow.
Dad, I waited so long for Shinu.
So, can't I wait for 10 more days for his happiness?
Just do as he says.
Emotional blackmail.
As you wish my princess.
Come on.
Thank you, daddy.
Anything for you my darling.
- Sir.
So sweet.
- Sir.
Very handsome.
-Yes.
Sir, here.
- Yes.
Sir, I was saying now that..
..your daughter and I are getting married..
..then send Sunaina back?
- Why?
Because if my ex stays here..
..then I'll feel extremely uncomfortable.
Vikrant.
Like every beggar needs a signal
Like every Gym needs a dumbbell.
Similarly this girl needs to stay here.
Balli darling, do you want to beg with her or..
..go to the gym.
Vikrant bhai, forget the words understand the emotion.
This girl will guarantee that Shinu won't run away.
Got it.
The girl stays here until you two don't get married.
No, sir..
 - I said it.
But..
- No.
Shut up.
Let's go, darling.
Dadzu.
Okay.
Remember one thing..
Dad..Dadzu, no violence.
No violence. No violence.
Bye Dadzu.
Come on.
I hate you.
Hi, Sunaina.
My dad's been pampering me..
..since I was in my diapers.
Whether it's clothes or shoes..
..my dad always brings me an extra piece.
You didn't get time to pack before you left.
So I got these for you.
You can wear my designer dresses.
Wear my Jimmy Chu's shoes.
Use my makeup.
What's mine is yours.
Except for Shinu.

Shinu cheater.
You coward.
You try it too.
I saw your styles, I just need to see your aim.
Ayesha, I've a problem.
Looking London Talking Tokyo.
I can't..
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
To aim right and to look right too.

Now I know..how Basanti felt..
..when Veeru was teaching her to fire a gun.
Fire.
Balli darling, I think son-in-law will be ready..
..to join the family business.
He shoots so well.
Shoots. Shoots.
You like Tommy.
 - Tommy?
Tom Cruise?
- Yeah, I'd love to take a cruise with him.
And..Yes.
Dhoni.
- Yes, he's my Mahi.
I love Mahi.
And then comes..
Oh yeah.
You shouldn't ask such small questions in a big country.
Correct.
But do you love Tony, Dhoni and Shahrukh.
No. - Exactly.
You were impressed by few of my punches..
..and you thought it was love.
Ayesha, you like me.
You don't love me.
I don't love me.
I love you.
I love you.
Okay, Ayesha you love me.
But true love is never one way, its two ways.
Like..when I saw Sunaina for the first time..
..bells started ringing in our heart.
When you saw me on the train..
..did you hear bells ringing in your heart?
No.
There were no bells ringing.
I am ready to leave Sunaina for you.
But there were no bells ringing in your heart..
..so who says you love me.
What kind of logic is that?
Bells..b***s?
Where's Shinu?
 - I don't know.
I was sleeping.
Just like May comes before June.
Just like six comes after five.
Similarly, every dog has his day.
You mean..you're a dog of this house?
Yes, I am the dog of this house.
And I know that..
Shinu is hiding somewhere in this house.
I'll wait outside.
Okay.
Goodnight.
- I'll be watching for him tell him that.
Okay, bye.
What did you say?
Middleclass girl should be left in the middle.
Sunaina, I want romance.
I want romance.
 want romance.
Shinu, this isn't romance.
Okay, okay.
Sunaina, it's been three days.
Aren't you happy to see me?
Shinu, this is no joke.
They aren't Angad and his goons..
..these guys are dangerous.
- I know, Sunaina.
And I am sorry that you got in this problem because of me.
But..if you love me, then trust me.
Shinu.
I trust you.
That's why I love you.
So come on.
Now?
Now!
Come on hurry up.
Peter, check all entry and exits.
All entry and exits. - Okay sir.
Don't even let a mosquito out of this house.
- Right sir.
But, Balli, how can Shinu escape on your watch?
Just like Superman wears a cape.
Just like King Kong's called an ape.
Similarly..
- This is the Great Escape.
Balli, forget the words, let's find Shinu.
Follow me.
- Yes.
Shinu!
This way.
Come on.
What now?
Now He'll do whatever needs to be done.
"I haven't seen Kashi, or Neelkanth."
"I haven't seen Baidnath or Devgarh."
"O Lord, my eyes yearn to behold you."
"Glory to..Bholenath."
"Bholenath! Shambhunath!"
"Listen to the voice in my heart."
"I'll worship You all day, all night."
"I've dedicated my life to You, you're my benefactor."
"Glory to..Bholenath."
"I am obsessed now, Lord, you don't know."
"Lord, you don't recognize my devotion."
"I'm standing at your
threshold to behold you."
"Why don't You understand?"
"Bhole, my heart.."
"Bhole, my heart.."
"Bhole, my heart doesn't listen."
"My heart wants to.."
"My heart wants to.."
"My heart wants to behold you."
"My heart's restless, it's eager.."
"..about You, I don't know why."
"Bhole, my heart.."
"Bhole, my heart.."
"Bhole, my heart doesn't listen."
Hail Bholenath.
It's over.
- I know.
Wow, son.
See, Balli darling, the house where death's..
What is the point?
The point is he took the Lord's name in this house.
Thank you, sir.
Shinu, you're a good son-in-law.
- No, hold on. Hold on a second.
Tell me one thing.
There's a huge idol of Ganesh in this house.
So why worship this painting?
Balli, isn't he Bappa's Papa?
 - Yes, so?
So first comes Papa, then comes Bappa.
Got it.
- No, no, tell me one thing.
Who worships the lord at 4 in the morning?
Balli, Gods should be worshipped from the heart..
..not according to time.
So did you write this song in Ooty, son?
- Yes, sir.
What's the source?
- Sir, it's original.
Original.
Original. Original.
Original.
See, Bappa.
Your Papa saved me today.
Hail Bhole.
Shinu, you didn't spare my Father either.
I wish to strangle you with my trunk.
Sir there are two indians.
Let them both in.
Oh, God!
Everything so nice.
Brother angad.
Amazing.
Oh, God!
Sir, Shinu's Mercedes.
Shinu's waterfall.
Shinu's swimming pool, the entire palace is so huge.
Shinu has hit such a big jackpot.
Sir, you can take sister-in-law to your 200 sq. ft..
- You..
True love doesn't happen in palaces.
There's devotion everywhere you see.
Hello.
- Hello.
Welcome.
- Greetings.
Why are you touching the feet?
These clothes are better than ours.
Hey, Angad. Who gave you the visa to come here?
Anyway. Welcome to my land.
Thailand!
 Thailand! Thailand! Thailand!
Come on, come on.
Vikrant sir, our deal was..
..I'll give you Shinu and you'll give me Sunaina, so..
I'm here to take her back with me.
That's not possible.
You can take Sunaina back with you..
..when my daughter gets married.
And that's after 10 days, tell him that.
After 10 days.
After 10 days.
10 days?
- That's not the deal.
I know that's not the deal.
But don't worry, time flies.
10 days will fly.
Fly. Fly.
Why does he sound system play in surround sound?
Because he was born in the valleys.
- Yes.
Congratulations on your marriage, Ayesha.
I am sorry about the slap.
But she's not Ayesha baby.
She's my girlfriend, Veronica.
Tell him that.
Cool down, baby.
Everyone makes that mistake.
Sorry.
But..anyone can make this mistake..
..seeing this gorgeous lady standing next to the old building.
Sir..can I at least meet Sunaina.
Of course.
Call Sunaina.
- Yes sir.
She's a nice girl.
Look after her.
Mr. Singhal, Sunaina is missing.
Find her.
That rascal Shinu must have eloped with her.
Don't move - Father-in-law.
Dadzu.
- Ayeshu.
What's happening?
Why are you carrying this gun?
I wanted to bless my son-in-law with my gun.
I mean..
Vikrant, we've found Sunaina.
What?
- Yes.
This middleclass girl was dancing in the bathroom.
Okay, got it.
We're just going for a long drive.
Of course, go, go, go.
Ayesha, go.
I want to talk to father-in-law.
 - But..
Ayesha, please.
 - Fine.
We are here.
Dad, you ruined everything.
- Listen to me..
Tell me, father-in-law, what is this all about?
Nothing, son-in-law.
- There's something.
You're holding a gun.
Angad's here too.
Something's definitely wrong. Tell me.
He came here to take Sunaina back.
Sunaina was nowhere to be found.
And you were missing too.
And this idiot said you're eloping with Sunaina.
So I picked up my gun.
That's what we do in the Mafia..
- What the..
That means any idiot can come and tell you anything..
..and you will believe him? - No, no.
I am your son-in-law.
 - Yes.
And you doubt me?
Me?
- No, no, no.
What's the point of living?
What's the point if you don't trust me?
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Shoot me. Just shoot me.
Shoot me. Just shoot me I say.
 - No.
Are you mad?
You could've died.
This is fake sympathy.
If you don't trust me..
..then send Sunaina back with him?
I trust you.
This is all his fault.
It's all his fault.
You don't mean it.
Send Sunaina back with him?
I swear on this, I trust you.
No one trusts me, send Sunaina away with him.
Vikrant sir, when Shinu's insisting so much..
..then do as he says.
And send Sunaina back with us.
No, keep Sunaina with you.
Remember one thing.. What's your name?
- Peter.
I trust Shinu as much as I love my daughter.
Sunaina will stay in this house..
..until the wedding day.
Vikrant, it's been served.
The plates have been served on the dining table.
Got it.
Come on, son-in-law, let's have lunch.
I've cooked Chicken Peri-Peri personally for you.
I cooked it.
I cooked it. I cooked it.
Chicken Peri-Peri?
You're so concerned about me.
Thank you.
My son-in-law.
You two can leave.
Vikrant sir.
I'll stay here until Shinu and Ayesha's wedding.
What?
And anyway, my mother had said..
..don't come back without my daughter-in-law.
Balli, serve two more plates.
Ayesha's wedding will be the grandest wedding in Bangkok.
Kok! Kok!
Okay, consider it done.
Why are you staring at me?
I am your friend Ganesha.
 - Friend.
Is this how you treat a friend?
You're not worried about me.
My life's in a dilemma.
And now you sent Angad here too.
I know. I heard. Don't bore me.
Fine, ring the bell thrice and leave.
"Oh my friend Ganesh, always be with me."
I've seen it five times, please help me.
Shinu.
Shinu.
Shinu.
- Yes.
It happened just like you said.
- What?
Bells ringing.
Not once, not twice, but three times.
What?
 For whom?
It's a boy.
- I know it's a boy.
But who's this lucky boy?
Come, I'll show you.
Okay, come.
Where?
There.
Peter.
Good choice.
- No, the other one.
Angad.
Even better choice.
Angad.
Are you sure?
 - Yes,
But how did it happen?
Sorry, ma'am.
But, Shinu, don't tell anyone okay.
Just a minute, I'll be back in a minute.
Bappa! Bappa!
Bappa! Bappa! Bappa!
If you keep answering your devotees prayers like this..
..then, from East to West, from WeChat to Twitter..
..your followers will keep multiplying.
Ayesha and Angad, what do I say Lord?
Bad idea, Shinu.
This was just coincidence.
Brother. - What?
Sister-in-law's coming.
- Where?
Look ahead.
 - Where?
Wave at her.
You get nervous every time you see sister-in-law.
That's why you..
Sister-in-law..
- I'm doing..
Wow, Peter. Early morning massage.
You really look after Angad a lot.
Angad's worth everything.
By the way, Peter, even I need a massage.
Shinu, which oil do you like?
Cashew nut oil, coconut oil.
I've both.
Peter, I don't take massage from men.
Don't mind.
By the way, who do I ask?
Who do I ask?
Who do I ask?
Who do I ask?
Got it.
See you later. See you.
Shinu's going to get a massage from sister-in-law.
See you. See you.
Brother Angad.
Shinu.
Shinu!
Yes.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Ayesha.
Feeling coy in the water.
People usually swim laps in a swimming pool..
..but you were on Angad's lap.
You were getting cozy with Angad.
Shinu, don't trouble me, go.
Okay, okay, I'll go..
..because you don't need me any more.
That's not it.
- That's it.
I say that you go and tell your dad..
..that you love Angad, not me.
Shinu, you forgot.
You're the one who told me love's not one way only.
It's a two way thing.
I said it.
Forget it.
Angad will say 'I love you' to you in a day or two.
Trust me, I've seen it in his eyes.
 - Okay.
But, Shinu. Don't tell anyone.
- Sure.
Promise.
- Promise.
Swear?
- I swear.
Go, go.
- Okay.
Tell your dad.
No, dad. I was wrong about Shinu.
As soon as he saw Vikrant's wealth..
..he forgot me and was inclined towards Vikrant's daughter.
What do I do now?
You tell me.
Dad, I never understood Angad's love.
I was so wrong.
But now I know he truly loves me.
I can't find a better boy than him.
How do I say 'I love you' to Angad?
But if he expresses his love, then I'll say it too.
Angad, I love you too.
I do.
Where is she?
There she is.
Oh..
Sorry!
I'm sorry again.
"I am bad."
All okay?
Flirting.
Shinu, there's something in my eye.
Come here, in the light,
Show me.
One more.
One more please..
Balli, I thought it was a gang-war.
They're children, let's give them some privacy.
By the way, my son-in-law's become Emran Hashmi.
Hashmi. Hashmi.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Balli, come on.
Thank you, Shinu.
All okay, Shinu?
 - Never been better.
Stop it.
Let Ayesha catch her breath.
Shinu.
Are you going to kill her with your kisses?
Balli, what are you doing?
One Romeo and two Juliet.
Sometimes Ayesha, sometimes Sunaina.
"I am bad."
"I am bad."
"Sweetheart, the way you smile..isn't fair."
"Putting your lover in trouble..isn't fair."
"Sweetheart, the way you smile..isn't fair."
"Putting your lover in trouble..isn't fair."
"The day I met you..I was just 19."
"I still remember the day, it was Valentines."
"Dwelling in my heart and leaving..isn't fair."
"I am bad."
"Touching the heart and disappearing.."
"..is a bad habit you have."
"Showing glimpses, and hiding again.."
"..is a big problem."
"Love is something that happens gradually."
"Never be hasty and take a risk."
"I am bad."
"Dancing in skimpy clothes..isn't fair."
"Staring at us with that look..isn't fair."
"I am bad."
"I am bad."
"I'm starting to slip with you gradually."
"I'm starting to find my feet in your arms gradually."
"Control yourself, girls."
"It's unfair to flirt with me openly."
"If you do it, it's right..and if we do it, it's..unfair."
"In love no one knows what's right and what's..wrong."
"The day I met you..I was just 19."
"I still remember the day, it was Valentines."
"Troubling your old lover..isn't fair."
"I am bad."
"Sweetheart, the way you smile..isn't fair."
"I am bad."
Johnny-Johnny..
- Yes, papa.
Telling lies.
 - No papa.
Open the packet.. - Hahahaha.
Johnny filled Nebo with salt.
Johnny, I have many illegitimate businesses.
But there's one business which..
..I run under the name of my daughter Ayesha, fisheries..
..and it's completely legitimate.
And you adulterated with that as well.
Why?
Hail Vikranta.
I swear on my benefactor.
Raju's now a gentleman.
Balli darling, Johnny loves watching films.
So from today Johnny's no longer Johnny..
..but Johnny Gaddar (Traitor).
Vikrant, I was thinking..
..if Shinu shoots Johnny Gaddar today..
..then he can join the family business today.
What a brilliant idea.
Balli darling, you're wicked.
Okay, son-in-law, your turn.
Sir.. - Yes, shoot him in the head.
But..
- Now take this gun and shoot this a***.
Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot him.
You sing wonderful hymns for the Lord..
..and love songs for girls.
- Yes.
Sometimes with Ayesha, sometimes Sunaina..
..you sing really well.
 - Yes.
Now let's see you play.
Play.
Raja Babu.
Dulhe Babu.
Jamai Raja.
Will you be my friend?
Shoot him.
Balli.
Son-in-law fired, I'll call you later.
What did you do?
Take it.
Johnny..
Father-in-law.
Balli?
Johnny killed Balli.
Run Milkha run!
Johnny!
- Run.
Welcome back.
Welcome back.
Balli, I am so happy to see you.
Balli, forgive me.
I couldn't save you from Johnny Gaddar that day.
Please forgive me.
No point, Balli can't speak.
- What?
Balli can't speak.
That means..Balli's volume is on mute now.
But..Balli can hear everyone.
He can understand, right Balli.
But he can't speak.
But how will we know if he has to go to the bathroom?
With this bell which the doctor installed on his wheelchair.
All the best, Balli.
I guess he has to go to the bathroom.
Okay.
I'll take him.
Me.
Don't worry, Shinu.
The good news is Balli can get well anytime.
He can speak, he can get up..
How can he get up..
What?
I mean how can he get up on his own?
I will help him.
Just like sweetmeats have 'Mewa'.
In dancing there's Prabhu Deva.
Similarly, I will look after Balli.
Wow.
He's leaving.
Balli darling, I found Johnny to get you revenge.
Saved.
Father-in-law, Johnny's in the yellow drum.
Yellow-yellow, he's a dirty fellow.
Dirty fellow?
Saved?
Dadzu..
What game are you playing?
We're playing 'Shoot the drum'.
Red is my favorite color.
Okay, red is your favorite color.
 Try it.
Sir, she can shoot too?
 - She does.
Watch.
Hey he is in blue.
Hail Vikranta.
Dad.
Myself Prasad.
What were you stuck in?
'Haathi Mere Saathi.'
Sir, they are my mom-dad.
 - I know. I know.
I invited them.
You two are getting married, remember.
He forgot. He forgot.
But nothing to worry about, relax.
Relax.
That day you jumped from the boat and escaped.
Today my in-laws saved you.
But, the day my daughter gets married..
..my bullet will pierce his heart.
It will. It will.
 It will.
Johnny, you should've listened to them.
- Take him out.
Take him out.
Take him out.
Mom-dad, this is..
- This is Ayesha, my daughter.
Dear, greet them.
Sorry.
Hello.
- Not that much.
Simple people.
Thank you
- Hello.
What kind of a house is this?
Instead of the veneration platter..
..daughter-in-law welcomed us with a gun.
They are dangerous people.
Listen, let's go back.
Sunaina, my parents.
Hello.
- It's okay, dear.
Who is she?
She's the one I want to marry.
So who was that?
She wants to marry me.
Brother, after getting suspended life is beautiful.
Only rest.
Rose?
Brother.
What is it?
Sister-in-law.
Why do you always lose, baby?
It's cheating.
Losing in love is a sign of manliness.
Who is it?
He's up.
Come on.
Balli, what happened?
Balli, take me there.
Sunaina.
Sunaina.
Where are you?
You in my room?
And that too so late..
- Ayesha, are you ok.
Vikrant is coming.
- Don't worry, I'll take care.
Go, go, go.
- Where?
Ayesha open the door.
Move, move.
Dad.
Someone is in the house I'll find and shoot him.
Anybody in the bathroom.
- Dad, what's going on?
What happened?
Balli's trying to explain by whistling..
..that someone's in the house.
Anybody in your bedroom?
- No.
Father-in-law, as long as I am here..
..how can anyone dare to get in Ayesha's room?
I mean who can dare too..
..enter my future wife's room?
Who is it?
I'll check.
Who could be here?
Who is it?
No one's there.
No one's there.
There's no one inside.
- No one.
Let's look here too.
No one's there, Balli.
I'll check in this cupboard.
Johnny..
- Gaddar.
Walker. Walker.
 Walker.
I am sleepy.
Sir.
- Yes.
Sir, you looked everywhere, check the bathroom too.
Peter, you..
Father-in-law, I'll check.
Shoot.
Not me.
Shinu you..
Should I tell Vikrant?
"I am bad."
Father-in-law.
- Yes, shoot him.
There's no one here.
And Angad isn't here.
I need a drink now, Balli follow me.
Yes why no.
- Not with you.
Okay.
Angad's ready in the bathtub inside.
Shinu.
He'll definitely tell you his feelings today.
And listen.
If he doesn't then shoot him.
Saved.
Come on hurry up.
Come on hurry up.
Everyone's gone.
You can come out now.
Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am.
I'm leaving now.
I really like you, thank you.
Angad.
Shinu. Only three days left for our wedding.
- I know.
And do you know what Angad said to me last night?
What?
Thank you, ma'am.
I really like you.
So that's love.
Tell your dad..
Wait.
Do you like Katrina?
 - By God.
Do you like Vidya?
 - Ooh la la.
Do you like Sachin?
- Of course.
You like all of them.
- Yes.
But, Shinu, do you love any of them.
Similarly, Angad likes me but he doesn't love me.
But, Ayesha..
 - As long as he doesn't say..
..those three magical words, I can't tell dad about him.
Ayesha. Ayesha.
My dear friends.
I am standing here raising a toast for my dear son-in-law.
What do I say to this old man now?
But before that I would like some of you..
..to say some nice things about him.
And I would like to request Shinu's father first..
..because he's his off-spring after all.
Cheers!
Cheers!
What's going on.
25 years ago, there were no Ipods or Ipills.
And Shinu was born.
Why was he born?
 Now I know why.
So that he can be Singhal sir's son-in-law.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
You know.. Shinu has made me realize who my true love is.
She's talking about you.
Shinu has made me realize..
Who my true love is.
She's talking about me too.
A toast for the son-in-law of the Singhal family.
Cheers.
I want to say something too.
What?
Balli can speak.
Balli can speak.
- Speak up, Balli.
Balli can speak.
Balli can speak.
Speak up, Balli.
- Speak up, Balli.
Just like every double-cross is deceit.
Deceit.
Just like every boundary is a four.
Four.
Similarly.. there's a right moment to..
- Speak up.
What words.
What emotions.
Time for double celebrations.
Balli can speak.
B for Balli.
B for Bubbly.
Let's have some champagne please.
Man has awakened.
Man has awakened.
- Johnny.
Forget it, buddy.
Balli. - Dad.
Dad.
Dad, it's a party.
- Oh yeah.
Please dad.
Johnny, Balli will decide your fate today.
Let's party.
Let's party.
Let's pop some champagne.
"I am bad."
Yes, Balli.
Speak up.
Balli, what is this?
Balli, words no whistle.
No, I don't like this.
I am eager to hear your voice, come on.
Shut your mouth or I'll really shoot you.
Balli can't speak.
Balli you dumb man.
Balli, sometimes whistle or bell.
You gave a moment of happiness..
..and went back to mute mode again.
Why?
You're missing your sister.
Here you go..
Peter, a man usually holds his head like this..
..when the girl slips out of his hand.
Now I will marry Sunaina in front of your eyes.
Have you said 'I love you' to Sunaina?
- No.
No.
Has she said 'I love you' to you?
Never.
- Never.
I say first go say 'I love you' to her.
Then we'll talk.
Okay.
See you later.
I'll say 'I love you' to Sunaina today.
You can't do it, sir.
Whose side are you on?
I am on your side, sir.
Sunaina.
Sunaina.
I am right here.
 - I am here too.
Sunaina, you know I am a bit weak in romance.
But today..
Today I want to tell you something..
..which I never told anyone.
- What?
Is she Sunaina?
Yes, its her.
Sunaina.
Sunaina.
Sunaina.
Let go.
Sunaina.
Sunaina.
I can't control myself.
I just want to say.. I love you.
And if you want to say something to me..
..then, I am waiting inside.
Angad, there's just one thing I want to say now.
I love you too.
I love you too.
"Fire."
"For your love.. I've announced."
"For your sake.. I bounced the hearts of all the girls."
"For your love.. I've announced."
"For your sake.. I bounced the hearts of all the girls."
"I feel restless, but can't understand."
"I stay awake.."
"..how do you sleep without me?"
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
"I stay awake.."
"..how do you sleep without me?"
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
"From 11 o'clock its become 12 o'clock."
"Everyone's asleep." "But my eyes look for you."
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
"I've counted 1600 stars."
"I keep awake, I wonder how you fall asleep."
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
"Gradually our love has progressed."
"My ties with you have strengthened."
"When I saw you, stars glittered in my heart."
"You turned out to be my lucky girl."
"By God I say."
"I want to be with you."
"I can't stand any distance from you."
"You don't come to meet me, and I nearly die."
"Skips a beat."
"Skips a beat."
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
"Fire."
"All the days of the week passed some how."
"When the seventh day came, I stretched."
"7:30 in the evening my desires are on a high."
"By 8:30 I get restless."
"Don't waste time, come to me."
"I waited a long time, I can't wait any longer."
"Anymore delay makes my heart yearn."
"Yearn."
"Yearn."
"One, two, three, four."
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
"I stay awake.."
"..how do you sleep without me?"
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
"Sleep. Sleep. Sleep."
"I cannot sleep."
Oh sorry.
"Saturday night I can't sleep."
Shinu. Whenever a daughter's born..
..the father always hates the boy..
..who will steal his princess.
But there can't be anyone more fortunate than me.
Because a boy like you is going to steal my daughter away.
Son-in-law, today I am assured..
..that you will love Ayesha more than me.
And I like that.
- Thank you.
That father is blessed whose top you have come out from.
Come out. Come out.
No, no, no.
Yes.
I love you.
I love you my son-in-law.
You're the best.
You're the best.
Father-in-law.
The love that you gave in the last 10 days..
..is more than what my parents gave me in 25 years.
See..so easily he's humiliating his parents.
But it's important to ask Ayesha..
..who makes bells ring in her heart?
Why ask her?
You made bells ring in all our hearts.
- That's true.
Dad, wait.
There she is.
Today I want to say what's in my heart.
Love at first sight is not always right.
Thank God I got these 10 days.
Because now I know who my true love really is.
I love..
Shinu!
And I am so lucky I am marrying him.
Sorry, Shinu!
God, you've been my friend since I was a kid.
Sometimes as Krishna, sometimes as Christ..
..or as Ganesh.
You've always supported me in different forms.
The first time I fell in love You blessed me.
But today..
..I'm going to lose my love.
I need You the most today.
And You aren't helping me.
Why aren't You saying something?
Otherwise all the time you keep saying..
..Shinu do this, Shinu do that.
No one's going to help you today.
Not even your God.
You made bells ring in Ayesha's heart for me.
But..we're going to play the trumpet on your wedding.
Thanks to you, Ayesha fell in love with me.
And taking advantage of that..
..I told her that I love her.
After that the poor girl was ready to say anything I wanted.
She took your name in front of Vikrant because of me.
Knock-knock.
No?
Forget it.
Why play 'knock-knock' with someone..
..who's already been knocked out.
Come in.
Will you knock before entering the room..
..after we're married?
We won't step out of the room in the first place.
Every night will be a wedding night.
But before you are climbing the Mt. Everest..
..you need to go Nepal.
Wedding night is too far-fetched..
..you haven't even kissed me yet.
You want me to kiss you.
Of course, Angu.
Lord hasn't created these lips only for lipstick.
Peter.
Yes. - I must admit.
What?
What happened?
Your boss..defeated me.
Oh my, God.
I can't believe this.
Let's congratulate him.
You've a big heart.
- Thanks, dude.
You're so sporting.
- Let's go.
I haven't even touched any girl, forget kissing her.
So touch me and kiss me too.
Come on, Angad, even the lights are switched off now.
Don't waste time.
Yes, good idea.
Peter.
Angad, you kissed Peter.
Angad?
Don't tell anyone.
What?
Sometimes you shoot me, sometimes you kiss me.
This relation is getting too complicated.
I was going to kiss Sunaina..
..where did you come from?
No, no, I think Sunaina came between you and Peter.
No, no, no.
Sunaina, I was going to kiss you.
I really love you.
I don't know where he came from?
I was nervous, I never kissed anyone.
That's all.
Don't worry, Angad.
I'll teach you.
Because kissing is an art.
So I want to learn the art.
Okay, so first hold the gorgeous lady's beautiful hand.
Okay.
Who's the teacher?
- You.
Correct.
First hold the gorgeous lady's beautiful hand.
Twirl her around.
Pull her closer.
- Okay.
Bend over.
You got it..
- And..
"Fire."
I can't believe this.
See how Shinu kissed sister-in-law.
Angad, learn something.
One more time.. One more time..
You..
Shinu.
Mother-in-law.
Save me from this white gorilla.
You animal, why are you troubling my son-in-law?
Mother-in-law, Angad kissed Peter.
And now he's furious with me.
Is it my fault that I caught them in the act?
I always doubted these two.
Especially this midget.
- No, no, no, that's not it.
I'll tell you what happened. - Okay.
Shinu said to Angad that..
..kissing your future bride is an art.
So what did you say?
I said I want to learn the art of kissing.
He did.
 - So what did you teach him, Shinu?
So I displayed my art.
How is that?
It's like this.
I held Sunaina's beautiful hand.
Twirled her around.
Pulled her close.
Bent over.
What did I do next, Peter.
- Kissed her.
Yes.
"Fire."
That's the sequel of Kiss.
After Krish 2 this is Kiss 2.
Shall I do it again?
Hey.
Shinu.
Stop, or I will shoot.
Shinu..
- What happened?
Why is he running after you like a bull?
Nothing..
Dad, I said to him that kissing your future bride is an art.
Correct. You're right.
And what did you say?
I said I want to learn this art, I don't know.
Yes, Angad said he wants to learn it.
Correct.
- Shinu will teach you.
Come. Come, Shinu.
Isn't this the same art I taught you?
Yes, dad.
This is the same art you taught Sharmila aunty..
..after mother went to the market.
Shut up. He's lying.
You know that you taught me this art.
Naughty. Naughty.
First hold the gorgeous lady's beautiful hand.
Twirl her around.
Pull her closer.
Bend over.
And then..
"Fire."
After Krish 3 this is Kiss 3.
- Shut up, Peter.
Balli, save me from him.
Balli, this rascal kissed my bride three times.
Me?
Yes, I did.
- You..
Do you want to see it?
Stop ringing the bell.
I learnt all I had to.
I can teach you too.
First hold the gorgeous lady's beautiful hand.
Twirl her around.
Pull her closer.
Bend over.
And then..
- Hold on.
Actually..I feel shy..
Close your eyes, please.
 - Yes.
Dad..
Father-in-law, see.
That rascal kissed my wife one day before our wedding.
He kissed her.
Kissed her.
Kill him. - I will kill him..
I will kill you. - Hold on.
Come here.
Even though you know my daughter's going to marry him..
- No. No.
..how dare you do such a thing?
Dad, I love him.
- What?
Me.
You saw that?
He's not the right boy for you.
He's corrupt, he's a Rowdy, he's a goon.
Goon. Goon.
Oh, God.
Dad, are you talking about Angad or yourself?
Because even you are all these things.
They say every girl looks for her dad in her future husband.
That's why I've chosen Angad.
And that's my final decision.
But..
How will I explain Shinu?
Explain him.
Explain him. Shut up!
Son-in-law.
Son-in-law.
No, son-in-law.
Greeting!
Son-in-law.
He's calling you.
Let's go there, in the corner.
Corner. Corner.
But why corner?

I think this time it'll be done.
God's being unfair with me..
..just like I was with Sunaina.
But what happened?
She loves Angad and wants to marry him.
- No!
No.
If I don't get married..
..then how will I face anyone, sir.
Who will marry me?
When my parents pass through the lanes of Ooty..
..people will say, "look there go the parents.."
"..of the unmarried son".
He's overdoing it.
You became a widower after getting married.
But you made me a widower without getting married.
Widower. Widower. Widower.
Dad.
He can make the entire world widower.
If I don't do as my daughter says..
..then I will lose her forever.
My daughter's life lies in your hands.
Hands! Hands!
Fine, sir.
 Fine.
I even sacrificed my love, my Sunaina for you.
So once again, for your happiness..
..I let Ayesha go.
"I am bad."
Let go of my hand, sir.
Balli.
Balli.
Balli.
Your true love made you the live-in son-in-law.
Ask Vikrant sir to adopt me as well.
"Where are you looking?
Your hero's right here."
"Where are you looking?
Your hero's right here."
Wow, Shinu.
You fooled Vikrant for 10 days.
He didn't know that you came to Bangkok to take me back.
I look sweet, innocent type.
But actually I am big rascal.
Oh, really.
I love you.
- I love you.
I love you, so much.
I never came across a bigger rascal than you.
Say thank you.
Thank you, Shinu.
Look after her.
Really.
They look so happy.
Made for each other.
- Yes.
They will give you grandchildren..
..and make the Singhal family proud, sir.
But who will plough my field now, sir?
Shinu, it's not wrong to tell a thousand lies to save one marriage.
Now see how I make your fields flourish again with one lie.
Flourish! Flourish! Flourish!
Sunaina, Shinu is a nice boy.
Please, I don't want that boy.
He's already left me once for the sake of your property.
Tomorrow if he finds someone richer..
..he'll leave me again.
Sunaina, you're wrong.
Shinu is a gem.
He took 10 days not to know my daughter better..
..but to bring Angad and Ayesha closer.
Right, son-in-law
Yes..something like that.
Exactly sir.
- Yes.
Good.
Really?
 - Yes.
Fine, then I am ready to marry Shinu.
Great. Great. Great.
- Shinu!
What a lucky man I am.
Today I don't just have two daughters..
..but also two sons-in-law.
What do you say, Balli?
'Just like evidence is called proof in English.'
'The ceiling of the house is called a roof.'
'Similarly, in every language you're called fools.'
