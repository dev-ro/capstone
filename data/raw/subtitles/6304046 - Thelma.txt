Come.
Quiet.
...can be both a particle
or a wave, -
- depending on what kind of
instrument we're using.
- Hey, mom.
- Hey.
- Is something wrong?
- No, I'm home studying. Why?
We've been trying to call you.
I saw that,
but I was in class.
What kind of class?
Bio began today. I was going to call,
but things got a bit hectic.
- Isn't that in the morning?
- What do you mean?
I thought it began at 8.
Biology is in the morning, right?
Your dad showed me how we can
follow your schedule online.
Yes, no...
They moved it to 6 for this week only.
But I'm cooking food and...
What are you making?
- Just pasta and some stuff.
- Alright.
- We can talk some other time.
- Let's talk tomorrow.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Ok. We love you.
- I love you too.
- Bye then.
- Bye.
Hello?
Hello? Hey!
Is somebody calling an ambulance?
Did you go a long time without eating?
No, not really.
Did you drink anything?
Alcohol?
- No, I'm not really a drinker.
-"Really"?
- No, I don't drink.
- And you never experienced this before?
No.
- Is it epilepsy?
- It's too early to say.
Do you have a history
with epilepsy in the family?
- No, not that I know about.
- I should look at your journal.
Can I call your previous doctor?
Not really. I don't want my
parents to know about this.
They don't have to know.
I'll just talk with your doctor.
Then you'll decide if you want to tell them.
Alright.
-
- Is it anything serious?
- Not as far as we can tell.
But we'll call you to run a few
more tests in the future.
Try not to worry in the meantime.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I wanted to say hello because
I was present when -
- that thing happend.
You had a...
- Anyway, I'm Anja.
- Thelma.
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes, I'm much better now.
That's great.
- Are you attending chemistry too?
- No, biology.
That's good.
- Perhaps I'll see you in math.
- Yes.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- It's in here.
- ln here?
That's good.
- But when somebody talks about it, do you get...
- I don't quite understand what you mean.
I remember Sofia and Gunnar's dad.
- Aksel.
- One time, when me and Sofia were attending a camp, -
- begynte han å snakke om at fossiler
stammer fra syndefloden og sånn.
Yes, you didn't say much,
but you finished a bit abruptly.
Marthe's parents are like that too ...
We met Marthe at the mall.
Was it last week?
- She says hi.
- That's nice.
They are very nice people.
But they believe that life on earth
began 6000 years ago.
I was visiting them,
and there was this documentary ...
That's enough, Thelma.
Don't make fun of people.
I wasn't.
But don't you agree that it's a bit odd?
I'm not comfortable with this kind
of talking.
- What do you mean?
- Knowledge don't make us better than others.
How did life occur where there wasn't any?
Do you know why?
No.
You talk like you know everything.
I don't believe I am.
- Are you sad?
- Yes, a little.
Would you like to sit down?
What is it?
Sorry, dad.
I don't know what's going on with me.
Sometimes I think
that I'm better than others.
And I know that I'm not,
but it just happens.
I'm glad you're acknowledging it.
Is that all?
When I see other girls with
friends and boyfriends, I think they're -
- uglier than me, says stupid things,
and I don't understand why they are ...
I see that there's some new friends
on your Facebook page.
What is it?
I'm talking to a few people before the lectures,
but that's all there is to it.
It seems like everyone but me knows
someone already.
But they have to get to know you..
You're so great.
Thanks.
It just takes time.
We'll call when we get home.
Take care of yourself.
- See you soon.
- Have a safe trip.
Hi! So nice to see you.
Are you leaving ...?
No, I was supposed to meet someone,
but they went elsewhere.
- Hi.
- Julie.
Is it just coke?
- Yes.
- Just that?
- Regular coke?
- Yes.
- Can I ask why?
- No, my family is Christian so it's ...
- I grew up with it.
- Is that true?
Strictly Christian?
No. Ordinary Christian?
That's cool.
It's exotic. I just...
I think it's strange
that people believe.
-"Why is it like that?" "Because God ..."
- Or Santa Claus.
"Santa says that's the way it is.
Santa says contraception is wrong. "
"So we'll just have 14 children."
"Santa says you're supposed to cover up."
I don't understand it, it's weird.
- You don't believe in anything?
- No.
I believe in things that can be explained
scientificly.
How do you explain
how your phone works?
- What do you mean by that?
- How does it work?
- It's not because someone says it's working.
- Well, there's signals.
- What kind of signals?
- First of all, it's not God.
I'm sure about that.
But signals as in ...
Help me out here...
It's similar to radiation.
-"Radiation"!
- It is.
It's radiation in the air,
and you get cancer from it.
- Hi dad.
- Hi.
Sorry for calling so late.
My phone was in silent mode.
- Is everything OK?
- Yes.
 Your mom gets so anxious when
you don't answer. 
I know. Sorry.
 She's been thinking a lot lately,
being in pain and such. </I>
-  Where are you? Outside?
- Yes. </I>
I've been out with some friends.
I've had a lot of fun.
Yes.
 It's great that you're having fun.
Just be careful.
I am.
<I> Okay. We'll talk tomorrow. </I>
I love you.
I love you too. Tell mom I'm sorry?
Yes, I'll do that.
Okay. Goodnight then.
Goodnight. Bye.
Bye.
Hey.
Hey.
Thelma?
Thelma?
Thelma?
- Is there anyone you want to call?
- No, not now.
Sorry.
About what? Don't worry about it.
Are you tired?
Yes.
Why were outside yesterday?
Didn't you text me?
No, I don't think so.
- No.
- Did you know where I lived?
I have to.
Yes, I've probably told you.
I got pretty drunk yesterday.
I barely remember anything.
...from the extreme value theorem, because...
So a simple use of the theorem...
I remember my dad holding my hand
above the candle.
He removed it before it left
any mark. But it hurt a lot.
Then he said...
"That's what Hell is like all the time."
Are you kidding me?
Are you...
Aren't you mad at him?
Well, it's...
It's a long time ago.
He's a nice guy.
Ok?
He really is.
I can talk to him about anything.
- Do you talk to your dad about anything?
- Yes.
Is there anything wrong with that?
No, but I think I've talked
to my dad about...
Ten times.
Shit.
He doesn't live in Norway.
And he's got lots of children.
I'm not really sure if he
likes kids.
Are you angry with him?
I think I was for a while.
But as I'm getting older, -
-there's less need to involve
him in my life...
So I'm fine with it.
"Jesus poop"?
That's not quite right.
"Jesus pussy".
The worst what?
The worst thing you can
say as a Christian.
Mixing the holy
with the less holy.
"Jesus t_"
- What did you just say?
-"Jesus fu...".
- Louder.
-"Jesus fucker".
- Why are you whispering?
-"Jesus fucker"!
There's one there too.
It's like that everywhere.
- A man?
- Yes.
World's smallest man.
- It's nice.
- Thanks.
- Everything alright?
- I'm not very experienced.
You don't have to smoke.
Let's go inside.
- Thank you for letting me come.
- You're welcome.
It's great of you to come.
It's always nice meeting Anye's friends.
Have you been here before?
No, I haven't.
It's beautiful.
I think we're supposed to go over here.
- Look. Have some to eat.
- What's that?
It's a food bar.
- I don't want chocolate.
- You haven't eaten anything.
It's ok. I don't need to.
Why couldn't Daniel come?
- We broke up.
- Shit! What happend?
Don't tell mom.
She loved him.
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine.
Lord, take it away from me. Get rid of these thoughts.
Take them...
- Long day?
- Yes.
Are you able to get some rest
when you get home?
Yes.
Are you cooking food every day,
or do you eat out?
I'm mostly cooking at home.
What have you been eating today?
I made some vegetable soup.
Are you shopping down there?
Yes.
What is it, Thelma?
Nothing.
I can tell when there's something wrong.
I...
I...
You can tell me anything.
It's important that you do.
I've been drinking alcohol.
And I'm very sorry.
How much?
Two beers, with a couple of friends from the university.
Was that on the same
day you didn't call until late in the evening?
Yes.
Yes.
It's probably alright.
You're a grown up now.
You have to experience things.
One beer doesn't hurt.
Be careful not to lose touch
with who you really are.
I know that.
- I'm not.
- Lot's of people drink too much.
It's easy to lose control.
Yes.
- I'm really sorry.
- It's alright.
It's alright, Thelma.
Don't worry about it.
I'm glad you told me.
- Try to get some sleep.
- Yes.
- Ok. Talk to you later.
- Yes, we'll do.
- Bye.
- Bye.
The power that overcame death
lives on in those who believe in him.
The tomb is empty,
Jesus lives
in honor and power.
Death is forever beneath him.
The tomb is empty,
Jesus lives...
Hello! Come inside.
Hey.
There you go.
- Sorry, do you want something else?
- No, I'm good.
Are you sure? Cool!
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You're drinking?
- Yes.
Where have you been?
Did you not get my messages?
I did, sorry. There's been a lot
going on lately. I forgot.
I'm sorry I had to leave. Could you
tell your mom I had a good time?
I'll do that.
- Are you ok?
- Yes, why?
Did you arrive here with Kristoffer?
Yes, we walked together.
Ok.
Hey!
I'm not having any.
- There's lots of people here not smoking.
- She knows that.
I'm leaving.
Inhale it into your lungs.
Oh, shit.
- Do you feel anything?
- Perhaps a little bit.
That's good. What?
One more time.
Now I feel something.
- Yeah?
- You're wasted.
Is this common?
Yes.
Hey!
Hello?
I'm just messing with you.
There's no weed, only tobacco.
Get it? They're idiots.
- Yes, they were joking.
- Yes, we messed around.
- It got out of hand.
- Did you think that was cool?
No, it wasn't cool, but...
Oh, shit.
- Are you alright?
- Sorry.
The scan we just did rule out brain tumor.
I'll be sending you to an epilepsy clinic.
We'll have to measure your brain activity
during a sizure in order to diagnose you.
- Why?
- They've got room for you.
They're able to monitor you over a longer period of time.
I'm sitting here with your journal.
It says you had a seizure when you were six years old.
It was diagnosed as a nervous breakdown.
Are you sure about that?
It says that you were put on
antipsychotics afterwards -
-for irregular sleep–wake rhythm.
- I didn't know that.
- They gave you Nozinan.
Nozinan is a very powerful drug
for a child.
Yes.
Apart from that, there's very little here.
Almost nothing.
My dad is a doctor,
so he always took care of things.
- You're dad is a doctor?
- Yeah, a general practitioner.
You should ask him about this then.
- He'll probably be able to explain it to you.
- Ok.
Mom?
Yes.
Not right now, Thelma.
Can't you see that he's eating?
You!
Go downstairs and draw something, ok?
There you go.
Mattias?
Mattias!
Where's Mattias?
Did you take him? Don't do that.
Where did you put him?
- I don't know.
- Tell me where you put him.
Tell me where you put him, Thelma!
Thelma, where did you put him?
Quiet. Trond!
Trond! He's here!
Be careful. Yes.
One more time. Could you open your eyes?
Breathe in and out.
Good!
Could you close your eyes?
Open up your eyes,
then breathe a bit faster.
Breathe in.
Notice how you're filling up your lungs.
Keep it in. And breathe.
Good.
We're ready to begin.
To provoke a seizure,
we have to -
- go to some rather unpleasant
places.
If it gets too uncomfortable,
just say so.
Ok.
How are you now, leading up to the exams?
Are you stressed?
Yes, quite so.
It's alright for you to answer.
You may also nod or shake your head.
Think about the things I'm asking you,
and let the thoughts come to you.
You said you had a breakdown
as a child.
When you were six.
Do you remember any of it?
Do you remember anything about
your parents from back then?
- It must have been difficult for you.
- Yes. No, I don't remember much.
You moved to the city
not long ago.
Have you gotten any friends?
What about boys?
If this is painful, try not
to block it.
Is there someone in particular?
Perhaps it's not a boy?
Close your eyes.
Breathe a bit faster.
Faster. Good.
Breathe even faster.
Hello?
Hello?
Open your eyes.
Watch the light.
Breathe faster. That's good.
I can tell you're thinking about something painfull. 
Don't ignore it. Reach into it.
Go deeper.
Breathe faster.
Breathe in and out.
Lord, take it away from me. Get rid of these thoughts.
Take it away from me.
Hey, it's Anja. Please leave a message.
I'm forwarding a bit here.
Watch this. Nothing happens.
If it was epilepsy,
there would've been a significant change.
So it's not epilepsy?
No, it's not.
What is it then?
What is happening to me?
It fits with so-called non-epileptic seizures.
Ok?
These seizures could be the result
of something else.
The body reacts to something being repressed.
- I don't understand.
- It could be because of stress.
It could be some sort of trauma.
Lots of different things.
But I've been looking a bit at
the genetic systems.
Your grandma had a history of
mental health problems.
- Are you saing that I'm mentally ill?
- Not at all.
- Am I crazy, like grandma?
- No...
Calm down.
I'm not sure what she suffered from.
But she was admitted for a long period of time.
You probably know more about that
than I do.
No, I don't. She died a long time ago.
That's strange.
It says here that...
She was admitted to Hellersmo in 2016.
The point is that further examinations
were done by a psychiatrist.
- That can't be right.
- It is.
It says here that she was admitted
to Hellersmo during the spring in 2016.
That's the latest one.
A psychiatrist will examine you from now on.
You'll be able to discuss these things
in further detail.
Psychological non-epileptic seizures is a
very misunderstood disorder.
She's having a grand mal.
For 3,000 years, people believed it was something supernatural.
That you were being invaded -
- or posessed by witches
who punished the sick.
The word "seizure" means being
posessed by external powers, -
- either gods or demons, depending
on what century they were living in.
Hello?
Grandma?
It's Thelma.
Trond's daughter.
Hey, it's Thelma.
She's been like this for years.
I don't think she knows we're here.
She used to be more lucent,
but then the delusions were stronger.
I think the medications she's on
is too strong.
What kind of delusions?
She took it pretty hard when
her husband disappeared.
- What happend?
- They never found his body, only the boat.
She thought it was somehow her fault.
She was awfully confused.
When she got cancer,
she thought she had given it to her herself.
- What do you mean?
- Well, she meant...
That she made things happen.
I told your dad the last time he came by
that the drugs were too strong.
He didn't seem too concerned.
Hei, it's Anja. Please leave a message.
...pretty clear. Apply the algebra for n-tuples to all values of n.
But then there's these
two and three-dimensional interpretations...
Something happend. I had a seizure.
I don't know what's going on. A girl...
What? What's going on?
A girl has disappeared.
And I know that it's my fault.
I can't stop thinking about it.
I know it's my fault.
Can I come home?
Of course you can, sweetheart.
Ok.
I know that it's been costing you a lot of money
for me not having to work during my studies.
- I'm sorry it turned out this way.
- You can graduate another time.
Don't worry about it.
What's wrong with you then?
I've been having these seizures,
epileptic seizures.
- But it's something else.
- Psychological seizures?
Yes.
I had a patient who were diagnosed
with that a few years ago.
- Ok?
- It turned out fine.
Drink your tea.
Don't worry about it.
The doctors says it could be stress,
but I don't know. I don't really understand.
Are you alright?
Yes.
I'm just tired.
Don't be scared.
We gave you something to calm you down.
We know what's happening to you, Thelma.
We'll help you.
I have to tell you something.
It's gonna hurt a lot.
"Quack, quack." Mom forgot the rag,
and you have to behave.
I'll be right back.
Could you watch this for me? Good!
Already up?
Just go back to bed.
Trond! Trond?
Mattias!
Trond!
Where is he?
Did you do anything?
Say it.
- Tell me if you did anything.
- I didn't.
I can't find him!
Is he down there?
He's not up here either.
Why aren't you answering ?
No! No!
No!
There'something in you. If you want something,
if you really want something, -
- what you're thinking, feeling,
something in you makes it happen.
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes.
Are you awake?
Are you able to get up?
Open up.
Lift your tongue.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have let you go.
I thought it was over. Nothing has happend
since you met God when you were little.
I'll help you.
Holy God, have mercy on me
who's offended you -
- with evil thoughts and actions. Give me a clean heart,
strength for a new life.
Give me a clean heart,
strength for a new life.
Holy God, have mercy on me
who's offended you -
- with evil thoughts and actions.
Give me...
I'm angry.
I'm angry with you, God.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
I'm angry with dad too.
I'm not worth it.
He's got to stop. I can't handle it anymore.
Why can't I just be myself?
Why isn't that possible?
What about the poor girl?
Who disappeared.
Were you angry with her too?
No.
I was in love with her.
And she was in love with me.
She didn't love you, Thelma.
Think about it.
Did she like you before you wanted her?
Do you think she had a choice considering
what's inside you?
You were probably just lonely.
You needed someone.
- I didn't want her to disappear.
- You wanted it in your innermost thoughts.
It happends.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
This isn't working.
We can't sit here
and kid ourselves.
What if she does it again?
You'll never be able to forgive yourself.
You...
You're a good man.
You're so kind.
But this is about something
much bigger than the two of us.
We're being tested.
You said that if this
doesn't work out, -
- we'll have to face the consequences.
No matter how painful it is.
Or how much we love her.
You've done everything you can.
And we'll all be united again.
- Hey, Trond.
- Hey.
Is that Thelma?
- Is she visiting?
- No, Thelma moved back home.
That's good.
It's alright. I'll take care of it.
I went to see grandma at the hospital.
Are you doing the same thing to me?
Is it?
Could you please let me go?
Get some sleep.
Trond?
Trond?
Trond!
Trond?
Where's Trond?
What's happening?
Thelma, don't go. Thelma!
Thelma!
Thelma! Thelma...
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You look like a real babe today.
- Thank you.
You too. You look nice in my jacket.
