Joe.
Where's Joe?
There's this thing I always do
after I give work to Kong.
I try to memorize everything about him.
I don't even know why I do it.
It just feels like we might not
see each other tomorrow.
Moment.
One hundred please.
Fon.
Want some ice cream?
- Say 'thank you' son.
That's okay.
Thanks, dear.
- No problem ma'am.
You bought durian, huh?
Me too.
I'm all washed up, man.
Know what I'm saying?
You remember what I taught you?
Someone gives you a gift, you pay it back.
You got to get revenge.
Is this how you pay me back, huh?
Over there!
Hey jerk, what's in the bag?
You deaf or something?
Dummy! He really is deaf.
'If Joe's there, bring him
to the coffee shop - Aom'
If you wanna' go, you go on your own.
What's going on?
Look, if you've got a job,
just give it to me.
If you don't, why the hell did you call me?
Iced tea and coffee.
- Hot coffee.
So, can we get back together again?
What for?
Things are good the way they are now.
What is it? What did I do wrong?
Oh! This is just fucking ugly!
Call you back.
Hong Kong says it's too much.
They won't pay.
Why's the price so high this time?
Shit! I would have
knocked him out by now.
You can't kill with your fists.
You should try doing it
before you talk about it.
Is that a new chick, brother?
Tell Mam not to go with that guy? Alright?
Wanna' have dinner, baby?
What do you want to eat?
Tom 'Fuck' Gai.
Go 'fuck' your mother!
Eyes straight!
How many times have I told you? Listen.
Good!
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

FIRST MURDER
ON HONG KONG UNDERGROUND
DRUGSTORE
Fon! Let's close up quick.
I want to go out tonight.
Fon.
- What?
That guy's really cute. Look!
What? I thought you had a broken heart.
- Hey, give me a break.
Look at him. He's got a broken heart
for sure. I can tell.
Here comes a customer.
You take care of her. Wish me luck.
May I help you?
- Kids cough syrup, please.
Hi! Are you sick?
Oh, you've got a sore throat, right?
Umm - just a second.
I think he's deaf.
The medicine you bought is wrong, okay?
This medicine isn't right for you.
I'll get you something else.
Now, take this medicine instead.
It's 50 Baht.
F-i-f-t-y B-a-h-t.
Could you understand him?
It wasn't that hard.
Thanks for yesterday. I'm better now.
Do you have cod-liver oil?
Could I have a bottle of it?
Do you prefer liquid?
Let me see. Is it syrup?
- Yes.
Fon, that's that deaf guy, isn't it? Huh?
You're giving us a ride home, are you?
Sure you can take all three of us?
I'm just kidding. I'm off by myself.
Bye bye.
My house is over there. If you
want to walk me home.
Walk.
What's your name?
You. What's-your-name?
Motorcycle? Why?
For me to ride? No thanks.
I fell off one once.
I got hurt.
It hurt.
What's your name?
Kong.
Fon.
Now you're all...
...better, right?
This is my house.
Why don't you bring
your friend inside, dear?
You should go now.
Your friend didn't say hello to me.
Don't mind him, Grandma. He can't speak.
If he's sick he should still say hello.
How hard can it be?
Nuk, let's go eat in a minute, okay?
Nuk?
Now, what's your name, dear?
He's mute and deaf, Grandma.
I know, I know.
Your friend is very polite.
He doesn't talk too much.
I know, I know.
What's your name, dear?
Don't swing too hard, it'll break.
Really, what do you do?
Kong! What work do you do?
Work. Like me - I work in a drugstore.
And you? What work do you do?
Wait! Let me guess.
We usually meet by day,
so you must work at night.
What are you?
You're a bartender?
You must be a bartender.
Right?
No?
You're a...
You're a security guard.
No?
Not a bartender, not a guard.
You're a...
I've got it.
You must be...
A gas pump attendant! Right?
You're a gas attendant! Really?
Good guess, wasn't it?
Strange, huh?
Hey, are you free tomorrow?
Don't move.
I said don't fucking move.
Give me your money!
Hey! Give me that gun, quick.
'I'm very scared.
I need to see you now - Aom'
What's happened?
What is it?
I need you to be with me Joe.
Who made you like this?
Who?
'BOXING MAFIA-MAN SLAIN'
Shit! Who's fucking with
my clients? Whose hand's in this?
We're working on it sir.
- I don't give a fuck. Just find them fast.
Shouldn't be too hard, sir.
We have leads.
Motherfuckers!
The Hong Kong job's not paid for.
Hi. What can I get you today?
Or is it Fon you're after?
She hasn't been in for days.
Fon. Hasn't come to work. For days.
Understand?
Aom.
I'll never leave you again, ever.
Get ready to die.
Do you know what you did wrong yet?
This job isn't ordinary.
- I think we should...
Money is not an obstacle.
Are you sure you want to hit this guy?
It's going to make big headlines.
Yes. But this is strictly secret.
Only you and me know about this.
Anyway - It's already too late
to turn down the job.
I haven't said yes or no yet.
What do you care who the target is?
Trust me. There's not
going to be any trouble.
Things will go as usual.
Just don't tell any of your goons.
Never let anyone know who the target is.

I've been shot.
It stinks in here.
Alright, check it out.
It's a body, sir.
Nonzee district, over.
We've got a body at Sam Saen.
We need forensics down here.
I don't care who they kill.
But killing our own people is not on.
The guys who did Joe will be
at this place tomorrow.
Don't!
I don't know anything about Joe.
Let me live.
Please don't. Don't shoot me.
Can you fucking hear me?
The boss ordered it.
See, I said there'd be no problem.
No problem?
Did you see the fucking news?
The police are going
to stick on this, sure.
What can the police do?
My right-hand man is an ex-cop.
Now, I want you to silence
the gunman, fast.
Then the whole story's finished with.
You know that's the only way to play this.
Fon, your friend's come.
Why don't you go out and see him?
I don't have to Grandma.
Fon, the bathroom light's blown again.
Please get me a new bulb.
Okay, Grandma.
I'll go get one now.
Why didn't you buy it during the day?
I told you but you didn't do it.
'I have to avenge Joe.
The boss ordered everything.'
Kong, listen to me.
Please don' t do anything else.
They killed Joe.
They can kill you too.
I don't want to lose my only friend.
This is a special news update
following the murder...
...of a national television executive,
gunned down in his car this week.
Police say the victim was driving home
from the Kao Mai restaurant...
...when a single motorcyclist fired shots
at close intervals...
...into the left side of the car.
Police believe the assassination
may be linked...
...to recent bidding for provincial
broadcast licenses...
...worth billions of baht
over which the victim had final say.
The only evidence found
on the scene was a 9mm bullet.
Meanwhile, the victim's family
and friends...
...gathered today
at his memorial service...
...to pay their respects, while the public
remains stunned by this tragedy.
Special police teams are following up
all leads and suspects.
He was a good man.
He shouldn't have been killed.
How could they do it?
Get them both!
- Go! Get 'em.
Quick! Shoot them.
Go!
Go!
Go on.
Who you looking for?
I said who do you want?
What the hell?
Open the fucking door!
Stay calm!
Don't! Don't anyone!
I said don't shoot!
Come here.
It's one guy, dark blue shirt. Find him.
Don't let him get away. Go! Go!
Hey! Did you kill him yet?
Who...
Cover the perimeter. Now!
This is Panfa, over.
We've got gunfire at Panfa, over.
We need two backup teams, code 05,
at the water plant on New Road.
Don't shoot...
Stay calm. Put it down.
Let's talk first. Just put the gun
down and free the hostage.
Don't do anything stupid.
Police are all around.
Fon, I'm writing this letter to explain
what I do.
I know...
...you know.
...what I am.
But I'm so glad I got to meet you,
- to know that someone cared about me.
I think maybe we shared love.
Today, I'm very sad.
My friends are all dead now.
I feel for the families of those I killed.
I'm very sorry for what I did...
...but I've got no more chances to
make it right. I have my own way now.
