Let him fight for it, then.

Get any poorer.
You're gonna have to
eat that dog.
[ Growls ]
I hope it'll be as tasty
as the one you're enjoying.
Real kings Iive in castles.
Like Lord Munkar.
Munkar was my magician.
That castle was mine
and will be again.
It is said that once
an entire army marched
against him.
A real army.
Munkar waved his hand
and turned the whole army
into a flock of sheep.
An army isn't the way.
A brave man could get
inside Munkar's castle
and kill him.
You need a fool.
No.
A hero.
[ Dramatic music plays ]
Heroes and fools...
...are the same thing.
I'll offer you anything you like!
Even all this isn't worth much
to a sheep.
I'll give you position.
You can stop living
like an outlaw.
An outlaw is free.
He's taken my daughter from me.
In olden times,
there were great heroes.
Men who'd ride off
to save a maiden
with never a thought
to their own lives.
Well, those days are gone.
I steal and kill to stay aIive.
Not for the luxury of glory.

KANG: I am Kang.
General of the great

It's your duty to give up
the sword.
Be on your way.
I will not give you the sword.
My Lord!
-Transform instant to serpent-

Hyah!

Or is it, Munkar?
[ Groans ]
MUNKAR: With this amuIet,
the life blood of generations,
I change my form
and slip your grasp.
[ Maniacally laughing ]
Get the amulet.
-He is heIpless without it-
-[ Squawks ]
Hurry!
[ Squawks ]
WOMAN: Lord Munkar's sorcery-.-
reaches even here.
[ Squawking ]
What was that amulet?
WOMAN: It is one
of the Three Powers of Creation.
Munkar controls two powers.
He came here as Kang
to get the sword.
The sword?
Join three things separate
to be the power.
More powerful than Munkar.
Toralva, don't talk to me
in riddles.
TORALVA: Just as the amulet
is the key to life
so the sword is the instrument
of justice.
I will tell you how to find it.
With your strength and courage,
Deathstalker,
you can use the power
in the sword
to get the amulet.
He who wears it cannot die.
With sword and amulet,
you can take the chalice,
and reunite
the Three Powers of Creation.
Look! Let me show you.
Munkar already holds
the first two powers.
The Amulet of Life
and the Chalice of Magic.
[ Laughing ]
MUNKAR: You are very close now
to the power, Deathstalker.
But it will not be yours
for long.
TORALVA: The power wiIl come
to he who becomes a chiId.
Toralva,
you're sending me into battle
against sorcery.
Would you stop talking to me
in riddles?
Power is nothing
if it is given to you.
Go! Reunite the Three Powers.
And after they're together?
TORALVA: You can do anything.
You will be the power.
[ Birds squawking ]
[ Frogs croaking ]
[ Water running ]
[ Sighs ]
TORALVA: Deathstalker!
Your thirst should be only
for the First Power.
Enough riddles.
I'll just take my chances
with my sword.
TORALVA: Look behind you!
Salmaron waits there.
The keeper
of the Sword of Justice.
Why didn't you just...
...say so?

Salmaron?
[ Hisses ]
I was sent by Toralva.
She gave you something
to safeguard for me.
[ Hisses ]
I live in this damp cave,
trapped,
eating mice, moss, bugs.
And you come here
looking for gifts?
[ Growls ]

Move it, move it, rats!
Cockroaches got 'em.

You don't have anything to eat,
do you?
No, I didn't think so.
It-- It cut through stone!
You must take me with you.
[ Scoffs ]
I don't think so.
I'm a victim of Munkar's curse.
I was once a man like you.
A warrior. Brave.
Dashing.
Every spell carries with it
a way out...
...that is no way out.
Your riddles remind me
of Toralva.
I can only be led to freedom
by a boy
who is not a boy.
With the power in this sword,
you can set me free.
[ Dramatic music plays ]
You know, I'm not accustomed
to the Iight.
Been in this cave for 30 years.
Oh, it's bright-
[ Groans ]
Take my hand-
I can't see anything.
Ah! That's better.
Kid, kid.
Where are you?
Wh-- Uh-oh!
[ Splash ]
[ Shivering ]

Dashing and handsome.
Are in the eye of the behoIder.
[ Bird squawking ]
What will you do with it?
Reunite the Three Powers.
And I will be the power.
[ Dramatic music plays ]
TORALVA: Munkar will set
many traps for you.
Choose your allies well.
[ Screaming ]
Get down-
Somebody's coming!

I owe you my life.
My name is Oghris.
Stalker.
[ Whimpering ]
No. No!
OGHRIS: Just running past
on my way to Munkar's castle.
If I'd known your allegiance
was with Munkar,
I'd have let them kilI you.
It's not loyalty
that takes me there
...but fighting.
This has the makings
of the greatest tournament ever.
I don't know a warrior
in the land
that's not bound for it.
-[ Woman sobbing ]
-The tournament?
Never fought for a prize
like this before.
To be made Munkar's heir.
Think of it.
That doesn't sound like much
of a prize to me.
lnheriting everything
from a sorcerer who never dies.
OGHRlS: No one's time
lasts forever.
I'Il ride with you
to this tournament.
[ Birds chirping ]
[ Fire crackling ]
[ Frogs croaking ]
Thirty years of frogs and...
toads, tubes,
and... spiders,
and things l don't even know
what they were.
That's a... magnificent sword.
May l see it?
[ Horse neighs ]
Spirits.
Spirits don't make noise.
[ Frogs croaking ]
Come out and show yourself
like a man.
Whoever you are.
Kill him and you'll die
before his eyes are closed.
Show yourself.
I'll take his hood off for him
...and his head.
[ Grunts ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Oghris yells ]
I had a dream we would meet
two men on the road.
I didn't think it meant anythingÂ¤
but now...
[ Grunts ]
Two men, huh?
Dreams are not
what they used to be!
I may be a woman.
My sword has cut down
greater men than you.
And I've dealt
with better women,
with a different sword.
Enough!
Save your boasting and your sword
for the tournament.
What are you doing here?
I'm Kaira.
I'm on my way to Munkar's
tournament as well.
Alone?
You ride the rest of the way
with us.
I'll join you
until the contest begins,
then I'll stand by no one.
Then it wouId be my pleasure
to be the one
you stand against.
Be wary, my friend.
Of what? A dream?

But only the strongest
will take my place.
We shall see in the battles
of the next two days
who will claim my kingdom
and whether good...
or evil...
will rule.
Evil!
[ Splashing ]
So I expect.
But the tests begin tomorrow.
Tonight you are my guests.

My Lord, Deathstalker is alone

Ah, little Howard.
Here, kitty, kitty--
Oh.
Deathstalker will not live
to compete in the tournament.
MAN: Good.
I would hate to see him win
and become your heir.
You cretin.
There will be no winner.
And when the contest is over,
there will be no warrior alive
strong enough to oppose me.
-Ah! You will kill the winner.
-Yes.
And you will kill Deathstalker
...tonight.
MAN: I will take ten
of my best men.
You will go alone
...with this.
Someone he won't suspect
must kill him.
MAN: He won't suspect me?
He won't suspect...
Princess Codille.
But she would never...
Wait, I know what

You could have ordered them
to be a little more gentile.
[ Chuckles ]
I want him dead.
Well, I can do it.
[ Chuckles ]
Not so easily.
With that sword in his hand,
he can't be harmed.
Then, I'll get it away from him.
No.
After all, my Lord...
I am his friend.
Do it, then.
