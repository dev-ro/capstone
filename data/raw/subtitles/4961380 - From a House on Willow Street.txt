- Hello.
- Hey, it's me. I'm outside.
Alright.
Daddy's little Princess.
So you want me to get in close?
Look for a way in?
Maybe check for an alarm system?
No, don't worry,
they have an alarm system.
Don't worry?
Ade, trust me.
It gets a lot worse than just
a fuckin' alarm system.
This needs to be surgical.
No mistakes. We gotta cover all the angles.
It's gonna take time to plan this.
Six weeks, that's what we've got.
You can't rush this.
We got six weeks or this doesn't happen.
If you can't do it, tell us now
so I can find someone who can.
All I'm saying is that
I've been doin' this
for long enough to know that
there are only two outcomes
to this little situation of ours.
One is where we plan this properly.
The second is where we don't get caught.
Look, none of us are here
because we wanna be.
Okay, this is the last chance
we're gonna get
at a normal fuckin' life.
We've taken things this far
because we all understand
the risks involved.
They're completely predictable.
Yeah, that's the first mistake.
We can't assume anything on this job.
He's got access to diamonds.
A lot of diamonds.
Owns a chain of distributors.
Has access to all the safes all the time.
Expect the unexpected,
that's all I'm saying.
Coming from a guy
that's been in prison twice.
Third time, they throw away the
key. You know that, don't you?
Yeah, we're gonna learn
from your mistakes.
That's why we're cousins.
Yeah, that's a zippy new hairdo
you got there, Goldilocks.
You hiding from someone?
Are you running away from something?
Sometimes, all you can do is run, Mark.
I think we can all agree on one thing.
The sooner we get this
over with, the better.
This thing has to go down
without a glitch.
It needs to tick-tick like a Swiss watch.
You boys all good?
Apart from freezing my balls
off, I'm just peachy.
You have balls, James?
Turn right here.
Hey, protection only.
Yeah, for protection only.
Ade, take the front.
James, take the back.
Yeah, got it.
- Okay, you ready?
- Yup.
Yeah.
Let's do this.
Huh?
That's... Interesting.
What the fuck?
That's right.
Do what I say and I won't hurt you.
Go, go!
Ade, lock this bitch down!
Perfect.
Who's there?
Remind me to scrap the we'll
return-your-daughter-unharmed
part of the ransom video.
What the fuck's going on here?
We didn't do this.
Stick to the plan, no matter what.
Well, something's not right.
Looks like we rescued her from that house.
Stick to the plan.
Drink up. We have a busy night.
Fuckers.
What did you say?
You should really let me go.
It'll be better for all of you.
Please.
Please just let me go.
I haven't seen your faces.
I don't know how many
of you there are. Please.
This may be the last footage
anyone ever sees of you.
Make it matter.
Fucking wiring.
Mr. and Mrs. Hudson, good evening...
It's a sick joke, mom!
Don't believe them!
You know the rules here.
The quicker we get this done,
the quicker you go home.
Take two.
Mr. and Mrs. Hudson,
we have your daughter...
don't pay them, daddy!
They're in over their heads.
Hey, hey, stop. I got this.
Leave it.
Hey.
You wanna know a secret?
You're gonna make it out of this unharmed.
Okay? This..
It's all for show.
The last thing we wanna do is hurt you.
Now I know you love your dad very much.
He's done bad things to some people.
Taken things that don't belong to him.
Now your daddy's rich.
What we're taking,
he'll make up very quickly.
This is just what we have to do
to get the money.
It'll all be over
very, very quick if you behave.
Rehearsal's over, okay?
Okay?
Okay.
Mr. and Mrs. Hudson,
here is your daughter.
She's having a really bad night.
We want the 300 carats of diamonds
you keep in your various premises.
This is a time-sensitive matter for us.
Mom, dad, please do what they say.
Give them the diamonds, please!
I wanna come home!
I wanna come home, please!
Send it. I'll make the call.
No one's answering!
Try again.
- The number you have reached is not in service.
- Shit.
Try their cell phones.
Ade, you're certain
these are the right numbers?
Yeah, I checked them over and over.
Fuck!
You wanna wait it out?
Because you're the one who said
this thing needed to be slick, quiet
and most importantly, fast!
I know what I fucking said!
Haze, you need to stay calm.
This is me calm.
You guys need to go back to the house.
- No.
- No? That's it?
You wanna bring somethin' else
to the table here?
That's not the plan.
Yeah, it is the plan.
It's called plan B.
What if it's a trap?
They don't know
what they're tryin' to trap.
We haven't made contact yet!
There's no way they've watched the video
and gone to the cops
in the last three minutes.
We can't babysit this girl
for days, alright?
People are gonna know
that I'm up to something.
I've got a court date in three days
and I need to be out
of the fucking country.
I need to be in Panama.
This deal needs to go down like we planned.
Then you fuckin' go.
I'm with you, cuz.
Just scope it out. Stay in touch.
You hear anything, you let us know.
Yeah, I gotcha.
Hey.
You be careful, okay?
Yeah.
The wiring in this place is fucked up.
Just go. No one's afraid of the dark.
Maybe you should be.
It's just a power trip.
I don't think the system's fried.
How brave are you feelin'?
I'm not.
Look, getting the scanner up
and running is top priority.
I need you to check the breaker switch
while I reboot the system.
Remember that foster home we had?
The ones that never paid
their electric bill?
- Yeah.
- Well, it's just like that.
The switch is in the basement though.
Of course, it is.
It'd be great if those two could do
some of the dirty work every now and then.
Yeah, man, this is a fuck-up!
Keep your eyes on the road.
Let's at least try not to kill
another family member.
Nice.
That's a good girl.
You just stay there.
You should really let me go.
Or you're all gonna die tonight.
Your dad's smart.
He'll get you out of this.
How do you know that song?
I used to sing that when I was a kid.
That's not all I know.
I also know why you kidnapped me.
Why you chose me.
But it's not gonna bring them back.
I know that your parents died in that fire.
You shut up.
And that you feel responsible.
Responsible because you lived
and they died.
Don't you think for a second
that I can't become the bad guy.
For the right reasons
I'll become your worst fuckin' nightmare.
Hello?
This place stinks.
You smell that before?
No.
Hey, same as before.
We find the parents
and get to the bottom of this.
Sneaky fuckers.
You think you're safe
by hidin' in the basement.
We've got your daughter.
Why our little girl? Why this house?
Why our little girl? Why this house?
Why our little girl? Why this house?
Why our little girl? Why this house?
Why our little girl? Why this house?
Why our little girl...
Fuck!
Oh, my god! What the fuck!
Fuck!
James?
Cuz, is that you?
Oh, thank god.
Ade! Are you okay? What happened?
I fuckin' saw Georgie.
That's impossible. George is dead!
You think I'd make this shit up?
It's this place.
It's this place, it's fucked!
It's completely fucked!
The parents, her parents are dead.
Yeah, and there are two
more dead bodies downstairs!
Well, their... their... their chests
were ripped or torn or somethin'.
Jesus, fuck, it's a mess!
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit, we're gonna get blamed for this.
No, the fucking cops are gonna
think that we did this!
That we broke into the house
and we did this!
We need to get outta here. Now!
Okay, okay, okay. Let's go!
Come on.
Ade, get up!
Come on!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Easy, man!
Shit!
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Sarah?
Daddy?
Jesus. What the fuck?
Ade. Ade.
Cuz?
I'm gonna get help, cuz.
I'm gonna go get help.
I'm gonna get help, cuz.
James.
James!
Oh, fuck.
James!
James!
James!
Come on. Come on, get it together.
Come on.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark?
Mark?
Mark?
Mark!
Hey!
Aah!
Hazel.
Mom?
Come to me, Hazel.
Where the hell have you been?
I heard something.
What, what do you mean
you heard something?
I saw Sarah.
What?
I know you think I'm fuckin' crazy.
No, no, no. No.
That's what scares me.
James!
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?
Come on, we gotta get back. Hey.
Ade, I saw my mom.
She came back.
She came back to fuck me up even more.
Hey, listen to me.
Alright, your mom died
five fuckin' years ago.
Okay, that bitch is in hell. Now come on!
Fuck!
Hazel!
What happened?
Is he gonna be okay?
It's not like
we can rush him to a hospital.
Look, could this be
some kind of a reaction?
Reaction?
Are you fucking kidding me right now?
Did he tell you what he saw in the woods?
Did he tell you he saw his dead mother?
There's something very wrong
with that house on Willow street.
What are you getting at?
I'm fucking losing my mind.
What did you see, Ade?
What did you see at the house?
Did you find the parents?
Oh, yeah. I found them, alright.
- Good.
- Dead.
Dead?
Sorry, is there a fucking echo in here?
So we're not getting the diamonds.
No, all this means is
that the game's changed.
Changed? No. No, no, no.
You don't fucking get it.
Alright, there's no game anymore!
This is now survival 101, alright?
I don't care about the score.
It's not about the fucking jail time.
This is life or death.
Get it?
Something fucking wrong
happened in that house
and we brought it back here
and locked it in the fucking basement.
Are you saying that she killed them?
They weren't the only bodies we found.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
James said he found
priests in the basement
for an exorcism.
Like fucking human pin cushions
there... there were garden tools
sticking out of them.
So to answer your question
I don't fucking know if she killed them.
But I do know she survived
a hell of a lot longer
in that house than anyone else.
Okay, so what the hell happened?
Let's find out.
So whatever's on this tape,
we need to stick together
find a way out of this, okay?
It's not gonna change anything.
Play it.
I think I messed up big time.
I found this, this sign in the basement.
It turns out that this house has a
a strange history of deaths
dating back to the early 1900s.
There was even a church
investigation in the 1920s.
In 1941, Mary Ellison
and her grandson, Bradley
moved into the Willow street house.
Two weeks later, she kills him..
...by taking a cheese grater to his throat
while giving him a bath.
Don and Sam Forbes move in with
their two kids in the 1960s.
He comes home one night
after visiting his mistress
to find his wife gauging out her eyeballs.
Their two kids peacefully in bed
poisoned with drain cleaner.
The next notable case
is Mary and John Davies
and their kid, Hazel.
There's no remaining photos.
John Davies was
my father's business partner.
A fire rips through the house
killing everyone except Hazel.
Sounds nuts, right? Just wait.
Wait, what the hell?
You lived in that house?
Jesus Christ. That's how
you knew about the diamonds.
After my parents died, Katherine's dad
took over the diamond business.
Moved into that house, my house
and before I knew it, I was on welfare.
That's the story. Let's move on.
So this is personal.
It doesn't matter how they were chosen.
They fitted what we were looking for.
Isolated house, single daughter, wealth.
These are parameters
that you guys came up with.
- Then why didn't you tell us?
- I did.
I told you I knew about the house.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Now please, keep playing the tape.
Mary Ellison lost her son
Bradley's father in the first world war.
Don Forbes was grieving the loss
of their third and youngest son Carl.
John Davies moved here with his family
after his brother
was killed in a diamond heist.
I know this sounds crazy
but if you're watching this,
I need you to believe me.
If you move into this house
and you're grieving
you're in for a pretty bad time.
The curse of Tranguul.
Devourer of tormented souls.
So what's tormenting me?
I had this taken out of me three weeks ago.
I haven't told anybody. Nobody knows.
Katherine, are you okay in there?
So this happened in the last six weeks.
Completely predictable, huh?
What else is there?
I wish I could
I wish I could tell you
what it sounds like.
You know when you, when you think a thought
in your head and you hear your own voice?
Well, I'm not... not hearing
my own voice anymore.
It's, it's something else.
It's telling me what to do and..
And -and the worst part is
I wanna do what it tells me.
That's the end of the tape.
He comes in my dreams.
Darkest night with taunting screams.
He comes and won't let me dream.
And all they do is scream and scream.
Here, try this one.
We don't have a lot of time for questions.
Now you know that girl in there
is not your little girl
anymore, so be quick.
Time is against us.
Why our little girl? Why this house?
The oldest, most complete
manuscript from the Bible
the "codex vaticanus"
is kept in the Vatican library in Rome.
This manuscript is said to be
authored by god himself.
Not like other religions or scriptures
not written by scholars or prophets.
Written by god.
You understand the weight
of that statement?
Now we find a lot of demonic activity
along this line of latitude
almost as an insult.
A mocking gesture towards the spirit.
Now imagine a spiritual force field
that gets weaker and weaker
the further you get from the manuscript.
Your house lies here.
The furthest place on the planet
from the "codex vaticanus."
We need somewhere quiet to tie her down.
Hold her down. Hold her down.
Untie me! Let me go!
Let me go!
Mom! Mom, please.
Dad, please.
You know what we have to do.
You know our only job, only mission
is to make sure that he doesn't
walk or crawl out of hell.
Okay, that's what we get paid to do.
I'm sorry, but Tranguul
is a leach on Katherine's soul.
It's become one with her.
You know we're not gonna
be able to do anything
to separate one from the other.
What does it want?
This demon
this Tranguul
it brings your worst nightmares to life.
And through that vulnerability,
possesses you.
It wants to manifest in true form.
True form?
It needs a total of four
living souls to consume
and then it'll walk the earth.
Four souls, one for each corner of hell
where it's trapped.
After that, it's unchained
from its suffering
and it's free to walk the earth.
Well, how do we beat it?
The only way..
...is to burn the first possessed.
This is a very powerful spirit.
We cannot let it consume more souls
and it will do anything to survive.
The more souls it takes,
the stronger it gets.
We're dealing with one
possession here with Katherine.
Tranguul's spirit will double in intensity
for each soul he collects.
We cannot let that happen.
He'll be unstoppable.
This is too much! You're killing her!
- Hold him back!
- You gotta stop!
You're killing her!
You've gotta stop this right now!
We're not fighting for her body anymore!
We kill her now or this thing
will take us all!
- Stop!
- Get off me!
Please, stop.
Come, let's get you to bed.
We'll be getting visitors soon.
Oh, shit.
I say we get the fuck out of here.
You saw the tapes, what the priest said.
That thing's gonna possess us all.
And then what? What comes next?
We're all tormented souls.
We're all mourning someone.
We're fucked if we stay here.
What about Katherine?
What about Katherine?
She's the last person that
we need to be worried about.
I say we pack our shit
and get the fuck out of here.
But there's still a girl
trapped inside there.
Then we do this.
We leave her here
and then when we're a safe distance away
we call the cops.
Make it their problem.
Yeah, he's onto something.
Let them call the priest
or wait for the second coming
or whatever, fuck it.
Yeah, okay.
James!
James!
He's gone.
Well, there's only one way out of here.
Whoa! Whoa!
Jesus Christ!
It's her! She's doing this!
Fuck this shit.
You better know where you stand with us.
I swear to god if you don't leave us alone
I will blow your fucking face off!
There's no escaping.
There's no running.
You must just accept it.
Your souls are mine.
Holy shit.
Move, Hazel! Find the others!
Go, go, go, go!
If I possess you, Mark
you go to hell forever.
I know you wanna see your daughter again.
You wanna make a deal
with the devil, Marky?
I need two more souls.
You give me Hazel and the kid
and I promise you walk away free.
Georgie! Holy shit.
Look, man.
What happened to us was
just a, just a shit situation.
Just bad fucking luck, alright?
I woke up from that car crash
and you were already dead!
There was nothing I could do.
I moved your fat fucking body
to make it look like you were driving.
So fucking what? So fucking what?
Hazel.
Ade?
Hazel.
Now the fucking cops know everything, man.
They fucking know everything.
I'm out on bail right now awaiting a trial.
I'm fucked. Fucked!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so fucking sorry.
James!
Cuz?
Ade!
No! No!
Fuck!
Ade.
He was gonna kill me.
Come on. Let's find Mark
and get the fuck out of here.
Oh, Jesus.
Where is she?
- Fuck. Fuck!
- Hey, hey. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.
When we get out of here,
just you and me in Panama.
We start a new life together.
Yeah, I don't wanna run anymore.
I'm tired of always being on the move.
- Get your hands on the desk.
- Mark.
Get your hands on the fucking desk.
Mark, dude, what are you doing?
Get your hands on the fucking desk...
- Mark, please. Fuck.
- Now! Now!
Don't you get it? There is no out of this.
You motherfucker.
You stay the fuck down.
Where the fuck are you?
Shit.
Holy shit.
No. No. No.
- Katherine.
- She can't be saved!
Mark, what are you doing?
Only one of us gets out.
Bullshit, that thing will kill you
the first chance it gets.
I brought you them.
Hazel has the keys. You have your souls.
I get to see my daughter again.
Oh, fuck!
Fuck!
Come on, she's like your sister.
Please, we need to do this together.
You leave us in here, then...
then you've sold your soul.
There is no going back from this, Mark.
- Down! You get down!
- Alright! Alright!
You unlock her. You unlock her now!
You wanna do this? You do it yourself!
- No, Mark, don't! Don't!
- Mark, come on.
I'm sorry. I'm fucking sorry.
Oh, my god.
Mark, what have you done?
What have you done?
Oh, shit! Stay the fuck away from me.
Mark! Please! Help him!
Oh, my god.
Mark, what have you done?
Mark, you son of a bitch!
Oh, Mark!
Go!
Move! Get out!
Come on.
Go, haze. I got this.
Haze, you gotta go! Please!
Come on.
Wait! Wait! We gotta go back for him.
Come on!
Come on! Quickly, come on!
Let's move it.
Quick! Go, go!
Come on!
Come on, we need to move.
Where?
Come on. Follow me. Come on, let's go.
Here. Here.
Oh, fuck. It's jammed.
Move.
Ugh! Come on!
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.
Hazel, come on!
Move it! Come on, quickly!
What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Mark was right.
- No! Come on!
Come on. What do you mean?
Only one of us can get out.
Ade! No! Ade!
All you can do is run, Hazel.
Oh, fuck.
No! Ade!
No! Ade, no! Ade, no.
No, damn it!
- Come, come.
- Ade! Ade!
No, no.
Oh, fuck. Oh!
Fuck.
Oh, fuck!
No!
Oh, shit.
Come on.
Burn in hell, you bitch.
