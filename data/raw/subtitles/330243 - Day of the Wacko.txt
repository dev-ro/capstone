present:
Marek Koterski's film...
The Day of the Freak
Starring
I'm afraid to get up in the morning.
I'm afraid of the day.
Every day...
...every morning I'm afraid to open my eyes.
Because of the dawn, that frightens me...
...I completely don't know
what to do with the upcoming day.
Damn, I can't.
Oh fuck.
In the name of Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
I do have some obligations, but...
Emptiness.
Like it wouldn't completely matter
whether I get up or not.
Whether I do something or not.
Goddamn it.
Hygiene, Food...
Work, Food...
Work, Smoking, Drugs, Sleep.
Goddamn it, oh fuck it.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
Do you, guys, have to be so fucking loud...
since the very morning?!
If I don't mark the fucking sheets
in the factory...
...at 7 am, then in your labour opinion
 I'm some kind of a flax?!
And you can fucking play with that hence the
very daybreak, not giving a fuck about people?!
So that the poet could not sleep more than
you, just a little more than you...
...even though he had felt asleep in the morning!
So that I could fuck up my whole day
at the very beginning!
The most important thing is, that the guy
gets fucking fucked up! For the whole day!
You'll come back here when I start working!
Nowadays I pull it in for the day whole.
I've been doing it for years,
for years I've been doing it.
I take the clock...
...unfinished night tea...
...and the infertile newspaper, in which I have
stuffed yesterday night before falling asleep.
I take the alarm clock to the room...
...probably only to...
...make him terrorise me
with the passing hours.
And I open the balcony door, to air the room,
and free it of the yesterday cigarettes' stink.
I drop the used newspaper in the hall...
...on the one, which I am supposed to dump.
This one.
I take the cup with the yesterday tea
to the kitchen...
...and I run the hot water for a
cup situated in a sink...
I put the milk there, in order to warm it.
Now it's time for seven drops
of a mineral water.
Because it's healthy,
and prevents from ulcers.
Three...
Four...
Five...
Six...
Seven.
And when I come to my mind,
that I'll have to shave today...
I rather try to see only the movement of blade
on my skin, rather than... watch the whole face.
I look with disbelief and envy
at men in the movies...
...who dr..., wipe their faces off shaving foam.
But I would... feel, throughout the
whole day, on my face, skin...
...not properly cleaned foam, that.
And they almost don't gargle after
brushing, with toothpaste, the teeth.
What the fuck do they do with it? They eat it?
Swallow? Fucking shit, what do they do with it?
I even gargle after brushing my teeth.
Garghle.
I put the bowl under the tap in the
bath to avoid wasting the water.
And I wash my face... Also for seven times.
Three times hot water,
including moistening and playing with ears,
with the ends of my wet thumbs.
And four times cold water.
Also including playing.
Finally I'm sitting on the desk,
and trying to learn some English,
which I will probably never overpower.
And I'm trying to make something up
on the closet.
I wipe my bottom for a long time.
'Til the paper's clean.
Sometimes... But very rarely,
it's done after four times...
Usually I keep polishing, shining it for seven,
or thirteen times...
...or twenty one.
Sometimes it takes half of the toilet roll,
before I'm satisfied.
I water myself for seven times...
Bottom takes three times...
I do it, sitting on the bath.
And I spread my legs.
Cock and crotch takes four times.
Altogether it's seven.
Today it's not the bathing day,
so it's only feet that's left to be cleaned.
I wash myself, including my head,
in odd days.
Theatre, doctor, or dates are the exceptions...
But there are no dates...
I wash my feet in that water left
after face, and bottom.
Cheaper, and more economical...
'Cos I see thirsty children in my mind.
And I think of drought in India.
Death caused by dehydration.
When I prepare the breakfast,
I usually turn on the radio,
and listen about traffic jams.
About assholes sitting in those fucking cars.
[All bridges are closed in the
centre of the city.]
[Roadworks caused a huge gridlock
on the Balczynska street.]
I drop a handful of standard
cornflakes into the bowl.
A handful of honey flakes...
A handful of fruity ones...
A handful of sprouts...
A handful of brans...
A handful of walnuts... Shelled, of course.
A handful of Cleopatra.
Altogether it gives 7 handfuls.
Hands.
Cornflakes are ending up today, so I'm throwing
all that's left in the bowl...
...counting it as half a handful.
Fuck! Goddamn it.
I hate food wasting.
In general.
My wife... Ex-wife keeps dumping the bread,
while there are millions starving in the world.
I eat with my TV, for I have always
hated eating alone.
[Bravo!]
[Scandal!]
[Bravo!!]
[Dishonour!]
Poland is ours only!
Only us! Poles!
- Bravo!
- Scandal!
There's only one reason, and me!
We have it!
Bravo!
Dishonour!
There's only one reason...
- Bravo!
- Dishonour!
The one, that's with us!
- Scandal!
- Scandal!
- Bravo!
The reason is only mine.
- Bravo!
And it's the holy one...
- Bravo!
- Scandal!
Because even if it's yours...
...then mine is more mine than yours...
- Scandal!
...and it's my reason, that's the most mine!
How many times have I promised to myself:
I won't disturb myself with it.
I won't disturb myself with fate of the
country I can't even change.
Because I don't believe in anything right now.
How am I supposed to believe...
...if my biggest efforts spoil through their...
Your!
Hands...
You can... say anything right now,
promise, vow...
Give me, to me give it!
Give it to us at this instance!
It is us, who must have the biggest part!
We won't give anything to you!
We are obliged to have the biggest part! We!
I want to have the most!
No, it is me who wants to have the most!
Give it! Give the biggest part to us!!
Prosac - for a will to live.
Geriavit - to slow the age process.
Neotropil - for better workings of
 brain metabolism.
I take Encopirin preventionally.
And then I sip it seven times with my night tea.
After fourth gulp I lick my lips...
I take a little pee to assure myself...
...that I won't have any doubts,
after I start drinking my upcoming coffee.
One...
Two...
Three...
Four...
Fuck.
Five...
Six...
Seven...
Eight...
Nine, ten, eleven...
Twelve, thirteen.
Coffee hill is not always
created symmetrically.
Sometimes even one grain can
 destroy the symmetry of a...
...coffee hill.
Okay.
To make it boil.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
To make it not boil.
I always drop some.
If nothing drops, it means that there was
too little coffee in a cup.
I try to do all my activies on the hour.
In the worst case on the half an hour.
One, two...
Three...
Four...
Five...
Six...
Seven.
I'm trying to cheat myself, but I know it won't
make any good.
I swam into the dry space of the ocean.
The wagon falls into the green,
just as the woading of a boat.
Along the bustling waves of the meadows...
Through the floods of the flowers...
I bypass that coral storm spur.
Could you lower the volume?
Could you?
COULD YOU LOWER THE VOLUME?!
My dear.
- It is Chopin!
- Come with me.
Can you hear that? It is only you,
who can be heard in the whole block!
My dear...
It is a competition!
How can you not listen to it?!
But not through a concrete,
 ceiling, door, floor!
I also can listen to it, whenever I am in 
mood, willingness for Chopin!
Because I love Chopin, and listening to him.
But not from you!
Because you have a will to listen to him under
the shower, whereas I have to hear him!
My dearest sir.
I also have to listen to...
...many of your strange sounds...
...when you have your visitors!
When I have my visitors?
Anyhow...
It's okay now.
Okay.
What does he sense in me?
I'll better do something,
or else he might fuck me.
Noone has visited me,
since I have been living here.
I can hear very well, what you...
...are doing there on the sofa.
On the sofa?!
What is being done over there.
It even makes the whole sofa move.
It's dick in your ass, which moves!
- He increased the volume intentionally, 
fucking asshole.
- Or let's take Vietnamese.
Take a look at those yellowheads.
Take a look at that treachery!
They keep flooding our market
with socks with a rubber.
They do it for a reason.
And you know why?
Yeah?
So we could catch a disease.
So we, my friend...
So it could, my friend, oppress our
 legs, my friend, our veins...
Obstruct our bloodstream, and then, my friend. 
Three months, and the disease is ready!
And another amputation... Feet, cut!
Knee, cut! Thighs...
But if you have your feet cut off, then you
won't use those socks... You won't use them.
It doesn't matter.
They want to kill us all with those socks.
But not me!
Those yellow knuckleheads' ears
 are too thin and yellow.
Take a look, my friend!
You see that?
I buy them... from those assholes.
Cheap oppression stuff.
And... cut!
I take care of that rubber with a razor-blade.
And the sock is...
...oppression-free, healthy.
Oppression-free socks, healthy, 
oppression-free.
I swam into the dry space of the ocean.
The wagon falls into the green...
...just as the woading of a boat.
Along the bustling waves of the meadows...
Through the floods of the flowers...
What are you waiting for me to do?
You want me to hit you, or something?
I'm working here!
Do all women think, that if someone 
doesn't leave the house...
...on 8 o' clock, then he's not working?
I swam into the dry space of the ocean.
The wagon falls into the green...
...just as the woading of a boat.
Sounds just like if someone would have
 been shaving the beard off the giant's dick.
Goddamn it.
That moron is trying to cut the grass 
with a shaver stuck on the pole.
Hey, man!
Are you fucking trying to shave 
everything here, using this?
Shave?
You can't call that cutting.
What's your problem?
You want to fart with that 'til the 
very night right under my window!?
I'm not gonna finish that this day.
I'm not gonna finish that today anyways.
Ordinary people are working at this time.
I am working here!
I'm also working here!
What are you thinking?!
Do you think, that if I don't mark cards
 in the asbestos factory since 7am...
...and if I don't fuck around with
 letters at the post 'til 4pm...
...then I can be considered as 
an unemployed person?!
Do you understand, or have you lost
 your brain on the last bus stop?!
I have been working here!
Am I not working here?
But with this... that... it?!
They've stolen the bigger one.
You can shave your head in your ass with that!
Shave your brain, man!
Go away!
Do your job!
I swam into the dry space of the ocean.
I am extremely tired...
...but it's still morning!
I'm completely destroyed.
I'm dying here, Mom!
My life...
Mine...
...was supposed to be completely different.
Locked.
Was it locked for sure?
Surely yes.
Have I surely not pulled it?
And it will keep torturing me...
On first, third, and fifth... 
Only after leap ones.
Fuck!
Jesus, fuck...
You'll have your Chopin.
[CRIMEAN SONNETS]
And I'm getting some kind of a block.
I'm looking at the table, where they 
are judging me. They finish the writing.
A journey into, not-so-distant 
from Odesse, steppes.
Wild steppes...
...which had been treaded not so 
long ago by swift Tatar horses.
They make him sigh...
...with a clean air.
With a silence...
...after the market commotion of 
a life in the harbor city.
They continued the journey.
A nomadic one...
Behind four horses.
'Til...
...they reached Accerman.
Mountain peaks...
...darkened in the night with 
an impassable wall.
He wasn't describing it...
He was creating them, from the beginning!
Their image...
More powerful, better than they were.
He was creating everything from the hence
beginning. Enclosing it with a word.
A shipping.
A sea storm.
And a silence on the sea.
The silence is...
...more silent.
One would say...
It's impossible to hear with an ear...
...like a...
...silence of a heart.
I'm looking for...
...just a pair of listening eyes.
Yes.
There they are, right before me.
Wise and girlish.
How come I couldn't find them before?
Just as castaway can't see the coast.
My whole world diminishes to her faithful eyes.
So I'll talk to them.
I'll tell them everything, only for them.
A ship navigator, without a breath.
Mayday, mayday.
For the only person who listens
to me during my lesson.
And in that silence...
...I prick up my ears interestingly...
...that I could hear a calling voice
from Lithuania.
Let's go.
There's nobody calling.
What happened to you, Sir?
I hit a box.
A box?
Yes, a mailbox.
No. That's unbelievable.
That's impossible.
Eight years in a basic school.
Four years in a secondary school.
Then five years of a higher education.
A standing out diploma.
Twenty years of experience.
And that's how they're paying me.
Just like if somebody would have smacked my face.
[777 Polish Zloty = about $200]
Goddamn it, fuck.
Oh, my fellow Polish teachers.
And beloved female Polish teachers.
There were one hundred thirty of us
 on the first school year.
We were thinking, that we have
 caught God's legs...
...that we have been accepted 
at a Poetry School.
Poetry School.
Jesus, goddamn it, fuck!
During five years, hundreds of pages...
Youth spent in libraries.
And then poverty.
Poverty and disappointment.
And then lack of hope and old age.
And paralysing contempt of the government.
From the dictatorship to the democracy.
Treating all of us like something less
 important than zero.
Why does the authority treats me like a trash?!
It doesn't matter, whether it's black or white
 I'm trash for it anyways.
Fuck, I feel like a mongrel, no matter what
the current authority is.
Why am I not a bastard with a bat in my hand?
Somebody would at least care about me,
if I threw a brick at somebody.
And we are supposed to be the heart of the land.
This land.
Despite we are not a primitive force...
...it is poets, who destroy the dictatorships.
They need us then.
Desperate masses.
Who can't see further than a piece of sausage.
Who can't see further.
So they still accept people at my age?
What happened to You?
Eat something.
Mum, I'm not hungry. I hit a mailbox.
A mailbox?
Eat the soup, a plate of a hot one,
a tomato soup.
At least it's tasty.
Mom, I don't want a mail soup,
I want to talk with Mom.
A mail soup? You can eat and talk.
Mommy...
Mom, I don't want to eat.
I haven't finished my lesson, Mom.
You'll finish it the other time, you'll eat.
How come you didn't finish it?
They were farting.
Don't use that language!
They were winding.
Couldn't you tell them anything?
What should I tell?!
Whom should I talk to?
I would tell them.
Mom has a solution to everything,
but nobody knows what to do with them.
After every Mother's advice
I feel worse than before.
I left in the middle of my lesson!
Such a good job!
Bad!
You like it!
I hate it.
If you hadn't left the college,
you would be a Professor by now.
No, I would be a scientist.
Then I don't know how to help you.
Eat...
Maybe it needs a little salt?
I need to take a break, Mom.
I need to take a good break.
Yeah, a good break.
Mom is not listening to me at all!
Of course I am, to take a break.
You can take a break now.
The problem is I can't.
Because I can't rest.
I ran out of ideas.
Or maybe some pepper?
Pepper not good for kidneys.
I'm so tired...
Of course you are, go to sleep for a while.
What are you tired with? Again?
With everything.
With myself, with my life...
With your life? You're a young man, yet!
I'm fourty nine years old!
Seven multiplied by seven.
Fourty nine years, I'm seventy!
Ten multiplied by seven.
You've got whole life to live on.
If I could spend my whole life once again...
Mom's already had a life.
I also won't have two lives.
Your soup's getting cold.
You have to scrape it, because it is frozen.
It will spread easier then.
Okay, Mom, I am scraping.
I always scrape, and I always hear,
that I have to scrape it!
I can't listen to it any longer!
I only wanted to tell you, that you
have to scrape it because it is frozen.
Make an upper light.
Mom...
I make the upper light I need.
It doesn't matter to me.
But it's about me!
Not about mom!
I have reminded you about that ten
thousand times. I hate upper lights!
I'm hearing that for the first time!
Because Mom's not listening to me at all.
I'm always listening to you.
Never.
I feel that...
...you have never...
...listened to me...
...to my word, sentence...
...to anything.
Have you at least disinfected that?
Eat the soup, it's getting cold.
Yes, yes... with Neomecin.
Soup...
Soup, soup!
I'm afraid I could kill my own mother one day.
Why do sons kill their own mothers?
I guess it must be fear...
...that they can get killed
by their own mothers.
She's poor again now.
She stayed at home.
I feel nasty and I resent her again.
Soon everything will require a dog,
so it could keep an eye on things.
I see one alternative for you.
Either tranquilizers and sedatives...
Or...
The option I would call the best...
A prolonged...
...and very painful for you psychoanalysis.
Why painful?
Because you could learn things about you...
I don't think, that somebody could show me
in a worse light I see myself right now.
We could finally come up to a solution...
Who you actually are?
What would you actually like to do?
Summarizing...
You would have to emerge...
...actually, be reborn for another time.
...as an independent existence.
Totally mother independent.
Nope. She won't like this one.
During the first half of my life
I was afraid of her...
...and then, now I'm afraid about her.
Every day I fear that she might die.
Every day I fear that I might die before she
does, and She won't manage to survive.
Away from the shadow.
I think I've chosen the best ones for her.
Everything I've been doing had a reason.
I didn't want to disappoint her.
And still she did not want to forgive me, that I
had abandoned the assistance at the University
and I hadn't become a Professor...
...but a teacher.
I just followed my vocation.
Paranoia.
Just next to the window.
Just to the front.
Just to the side.
Just to nobody knows why.
Why is paranoia a part of my life?
So there are no drugs for this?
No.
My acquintance told me...
...that you've given him some anti-epilepsy
drugs, and they made him feel better.
No.
He slept afterwards.
No.
He really did.
Unfortunately.
Maybe you could go with this to Dr. Malejka?
Go to Dr. Malejka with this, these problems?
He's a surgeon.
You've always had trusted him so much.
I'll go to him, if I'll have to have my leg
cut off - not a head.
And I regret that I have said that.
Because I see, that I have noone to
talk with anymore.
She has always fought for everything.
For every detail, tooth for a tooth.
She's taken my whole life, and now
I can't even say no.
Now judge, for example Pinochette.
I prefer to give you something certain.
He's prescribing me Trebretol,
usual stuff for mentally ill people.
And Melery - for suicidal thoughts.
If you have, such...
...to that window...
...you want to jump out.
Now I can go and visit my son.
Fifteenth floor. Yeah.
Can't you hold that dog for a moment?
And you are... fumbling somehow with that.
What fumbling? I'm just correcting
the plaster, dressing.
Am I supposed to suffer,
die because I'm with a dog?
Do not raise your voice,
because he's getting angry.
- Hey, son.
- Hi.
I'm exhausted, I must get a rest.
I don't know, why I'm telling her about it.
Sure you have to.
I'm going to the Freedom Legion meeting.
With clothes?
Clothes?
With a dressing-gown?
You're dragging the belt on the floor.
Yeah, dragging.
Silvester, my son.
I've bought you chocolate brooches
in the fridge for the supper.
Mommy bought them for you, with chocolate.
Mom bought brooches.
Brooches?
Brooches? For the supper?
You've probably lost your mind.
My ass!
You lost it a long time ago!
You've always suffered from the womb rabies.
Go buy yourself a pin, and keep sitting on it.
Maybe you'll get calmer.
Pig.
Twat!
I'm getting married.
With dog.
With shit.
A bitch should marry only a dog.
And don't hide the phone!
What do you need it for anyways?
Giving ass requires nothing but hands.
How about repeating English?
Dad, no, what's wrong with you?
Conjugate "be".
Dad, come on.
Go on.
Stop it, Dad.
You don't know how to conjugate it.
Yeah, right.
So conjugate.
Come on, I...
I...
Am...
Am...
I am...
I know, I am...
You are.
You are...
I'll do it by myself!
But you're not saying anything.
- Because you...
- What me, what me?!
...are stressing me.
I am stressing you?! Goddamn it, you've been
learning it for five years, in school and on
private lessons, and it's like blood...
...blood spilled in a sand.
Yeah, blood.
What were we conjugating?
What what?
What word were we conjugating?
A word, normally.
Auxiliary verb!
Yeah.
Which one?
Auxiliary.
Which auxiliary?
To...
Am?
To be! Fuck!
Or not to be!
You haven't heard of that either?!
You must admit, that there's noone else
who would do that better than me.
Indeed.
There's noone, who could beat your hood.
It's fucking good.
Only in the deepest depths of my soul,
just like a burning tooth...
...I fear that dizzy generation gap.
My father has also struggled with
the leaving, like me.
And that madness will not probably
end up that easily.
Silvester, it was a suicide to buy you that
Leevis light orange jacket...
- Levis!
- Levis.
They might kill you for it one day.
It's fucking good.
There have been so many muggings lately.
Muggings?
Dad, you are...
- We'll see, after you get married and...
- I'll never get married.
- Yeah. And after you see your first kid...
- I'll never have children.
Your fucking gives me headaches.
Dad! Don't use that language, when talking to your kid!
Why don't you want to marry any girl?
Just follow your heart's voice.
Do you know how big experience is
an ecclesiastical marriage?
But you didn't have an ecclesiastical, dad?
We didn't have, but I still would like to have
one... The problem is, I don't know with whom.
I won't take ecclesiastical for sure.
Why not?
Because if it dies, or falls apart, then you can't break it.
But you can't assume, that everything will fail.
The better option would be to believe,
that it will succeed and it will last
for the rest of your life.
But you have to take care about your marriage.
Cultivate it like with garden.
What's the most popular Chopin's work?
Chopin's?
Polonez az dur. Revolutionary etude.
But the most popular. The one everybody knows.
Prolly revolutionary etude.
It is said he wrote it for a chick.
For a chick? It probably wasn't
revolutionary, then.
I wonder if she had spreaded legs for him.
If she what?
Well, if he had zipped, nailed her.
Well, it's time for me to go.
I must hurry. Gotta go.
Where do you have to go, Dad? Fuck...
I'm fucking hurrying to my house.
You fucking hurry to your house?
Fuck, you are right...
What happened to you?
I fucked onto a mailbox.
Hehe, man, fucking cool.
If I could meet Elzbieta, my first love...
I would start everything from the scratch.
I meet all others, but not her.
So many years from drifting apart.
So many years from escape from her,
from my only love, So many years.
Unfamiliar woman pushes me, like if I
would have been a dignity-devoided kid.
What are you doing with that hand,
you keep pushing me!
I'm pushing you?
You were doing that all the time insolently!
I was just holding my hand like that.
What a bag!
Only not a bag!
Offhanded!
And you're not acting like a real man.
Abrupt!
How is he talking to a woma...
I'm not talking to a woman, but to a pusher,
which was pushing me off like a bulldozer!
I would touch a man, but not you.
Not a vampire.
Bag keeps on pushing me like an item,
thing and eating fudges.
Vampire.
- Bulldozer!
- Vampire!
- Panzerfaust!
- Vampire.
- Tank!
- Vampire.
- P-75.
- Vampire.
Fudged tank!
Crazy vampire!
Fuck.
Like if I knew, if it fits on her ass,
goddamn it.
Those asses come to the newsagent's to
make a show, not to shop.
- Is that the last copy of "Woman" magazine?
What's more, that stupid poop is yelling
right into my ears.
Woman, is that the last one?
Yes.
So I, although I don't need it and completely
don't give a shit about it...
I'd like that Woman, if I can... I can.
Oh my! Maybe you don't need it that much?
No, why? ...I'd love to browse it.
And I'm leaving happily.
Well, maybe half-happily.
Fuck, now those fucking kids. Goddamn it, I can't.
[LEFT WING ST.] [RIGHT WING ST.]
[TAK = Yes] [NIE = No]
Man, what a stupidity to make a
manifest with seven people.
That's what democracy is for - so that even
a single person could express what he's feeling.
With such idiotic messages?
With the most idiotic - that's tolerancy.
Man, fuck the tolerancy.
It is you, who's fucking wrong.
Only not fucking, 'cos I can smack you
in the face, smack.
I also can smack you, smack.
Is it impossible to clear the place up,
after their beloved pets are done?
It's a plague.
What's the shitness difference between
animal shit and human shit?
What would they do, if I started to shit
on playgrounds, in the shadows...
...in the arcades.
Leave my faeces on the concrete,
pavements, shit on the clearings.
I've got to buy a gun.
I don't have time for correspondence.
I receive letters from Rossmann...
...Pizza Hut.
Maybe it's finally some kind of
fate transformation?
It's terribly here.
I can choose the cheapest gold and
diamonds in Warsaw.
It will be your gold year.
Is there anyone in this holy world
on lower position than me?
In 7 minutes it will be half past 2.
I pour the tea, and wait seven minutes,
minding the prescription.
And I start mixing. Three to the right...
Four to the left.
Seven.
It hurts me, when I throw away extras from the
newspapers. I can imagine in my mind those
disappearing forests.
Throwing extra named "House" I see falling oak.
"Tourism" - lime.
"Messages" - spruces fall like winter flowers.
"Auto-Moto" - like masts pines fall.
"Supermarket"...is a larch.
Maple..."Real Estate".
"My computer" - and beech hides under his own roots.
Their wounds bleed with resin more
and more with every extra.
Oh. A friend of mine has died.
I fear, that I could die unexpectedly.
I fear it.
I'd die and leave nothing for my son.
A child must be taught the way to swim...
...and you want to leave him a lifebelt?
I'm totally destroyed. Gutted out.
Deafened by food.
And with the remnants of my strengths,
I leave. With remnants.
Get away, man!
You me play?
Leave now!
Fuck this kind of playing!
Nobody wants to listen to this any more!
What do you think? That you're playing on Praga
before war or right after it?
Have you been laying under
the ice for half an age?
- Whom are you playing for?
- For people!
D' you know what I do, when I need music!?
Here! From Cocker to Mozart!
Or for example I can, for example,
listen to, for example, Chopin!
Without any problems!
And you want to sing for me some banned songs!
FUCK OUT WITH THAT HARMONY!
Or I'll shoot you in your ass!
Easy...
What am I supposed to do now...
Drink coffee after a tranquilizer...
If I could only meet Ela... My first love.
I could start everything with her
from a scratch.
Since I saw her for the first time...
What are you doing?!
What?
You are shitting with him right under my window!
It's just a dog! Just!
So what? Does he have a less shittier shit
than human?
- Get out!
- Easy, Totty, easy.
What, if I would shit under your window?!
Under you?!
What the hell?!
I'm shitting, just like your dog.
You're ill-minded!
Dogs are obliged to show the same discipline
and obey rules of coexistence
just like people have to.
Freedom of some units cannot cost
freedom of another.
Now I'm a poet...
...and I'm writing a poem.
In the garden, there sits that royal couple.
Not to reach for it and not to write...
As there is no pen...
...or to reach for it and write nothing?
...as I will be mad about my broken imagination.
So that my invention will get ruined by irritation.
But on the other hand, not ruining anything
I won't be able to write.
In the garden...
...there sits that royal couple.
I feel no inspiration, but irritation.
Ouch!
- Feely?
- Ouch, I can feel!
- Feely?  - This one fucks the most.
Today the right one, yesterday the left one.
- Feely?
- Those are needles, aren't they?
Feely.
- Feely?
- Yes.
- Feely the electricity?
- Yeah, it's making me kinda angry today.
Acupuncture good electricity.
- Ouch!
- Feely, hurting?
As hell.
Hurting, feely.
Ouch!
Laying twenty minutes, not moving toe!
Ah hell, why should I give a fuck
about this yellow doll?
- Jesus!
- Moving toe!
Fuck, I've got a stiff leg!
Moving, stiff leg! How many years have you?
Forty nine, seven multiplied by seven.
Fifty, seventy seven.
- Yah, I can cee that.
- Name your?
Miauczynski Adas. Adam.
You eat your teeth very much.
I grit them hard.
Every coffee I drink, I grit them
harder and harder.
One day you won't open them.
We should think about making a splint.
You'd be putting it for nights protectively.
What if I swallow it?
Leave, pull the trousers down.
Mrs Doctor?
This lady is asking, if Mrs Doctor
would service her today.
Double up!
And where does she live?
Pilsudski Street,
formerly known as Mickiewicz St.
So what? Problems with urination?
Double up! Do not huddle like a dog while pooping.
- Maybe not problems, but I don't urinate
like a... fire truck?
I'll take it.
And I always have the feeling I don't ful...,
fully urinate.
Tell her to wait.
How long have you been suffering from that?
Since the childhood. I have always had to
take additional pees before sleep.
Youthful prostate.
Do not lower your head.
I can easily notice, that you are too modest.
Heads up!
And heads up! You are an important
person after all.
He's afraid of a dachshund, silly!
You're silly!
You manure! Kicking an invalid, you?!
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus...
He's killed me! Marian!
Jozek!
I'd better run, I could get killed by
those local drunks.
In any case, I'll just reject I did it.
Or maybe I'll cut off my moustache.
And once again I'm acting unassertively, fuck!
Am I a madman?
If I could meet Ela...
...I'd be saved.
If I could only find my first love...
...everything... everything could still be different.
...I could start everything from scratch.
Everything could be possible. Still.
There would still be a chance...
Still... there would be a chance.
Ela...
My first and the only one.
Jesus, God. Deja Voo.
Deja Ve.
Well... Deja Vu.
I want to die.
Or I'll leave the city.
But on 6th?
Ah, I took the light ones.
I won't be wearing those dark gloomy,
darkies gloomy all the time.
Maybe eventually I'll... write
something of my own in the train.
And English... I still can't learn it.
For sure?
Okay, I've locked it.
But have I turned the taps off? Gas taps, water taps?
Have I turned them off for sure? Every one of them?
Main gas tap? Yes. Those near the cistern in
the bathroom behind the mirror?
I'm sure I've turned them off, but what
about the one under the sink?
I've already fucking flooded once that
asshole from the lower floor.
I haven't turned it off.
Fuck, how do seniors turn off the taps, which do not move a bit?
I forgot to sit!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Fuck, I forgot to kiss Jesus,
the Little's feet before leaving!
What I first choose is a compartment.
Nonsmoking compartment, of course naturally.
You must know, that there is nothing
more deadlier than breathing with a
cigarette smoke for a couple of hours.
If they won't... open and close while
stopping and starting?
And if they are not too tight... so I would
not have to tug with them every time
I want to pee, take a piss.
Whether they screech when turned, or not.
If it's empty, and I sit not towards
the direction of the drive.
At least it won't wind at least...
...in case of some asshole's airing, but it has
the disadvantage, that I'm the first
one to whom they are going to join.
Because there is only free place towards
the direction of the drive here.
Nice catch for somebody, who has a kid.
I take a place towards, and I'll catch a cold.
I take a place not towards, and put my bag
on the place towards, and
a sweated fatty will emerge next to me.
Okay, I'll take a place not towards.
It's a little bland though, to say the truth.
But it's the safest in case of a crash.
If anything bad occurs, I'll tell them. Maybe
 it'll be free up from Central Warsaw Station.
I'll get separated from the
cattle when I still can.
Do not talk, do not talk at all.
In the garden, there sits that royal couple.
Now I know, that he'll be sitting next to me.
Make the shades.
What the? Madwoman.
You're a madman. It won't matter to you, if I?
But why? It's a broad daylight.
Midday. 4 p.m., September, it's not 6 p. M yet!
Eh, you're a madwoman.
I'm nothing but ashamed about you, nothing.
It is you, who is a madman.
What do you need that for, madwoman?
Broad daylight, midday, 4 p. M...
September, summer, that man
says it's not even 6 p.m.
I hate you!
It's quarter 'til departure, and I'm already wet. The end.
I was supposed to write a poem, poem.
Fuck the writing, fuck the reading.
I won't understand "Sport" in the
 newspaper, I'm powdered.
Completely demonted.
I'm out, crazy madman.
And you sit here, mad crazyman!
Or maybe I just attract weirdos?
In the garden...
I'm sorry, are those free seats?
- Yes.
- Sisters!
Come, come!
Now it's stinking in the whole compartment.
Dog burgers, maybe even mixed up with kennels.
And I'm waiting for the dog.
Just like performing the execution.
Because it had already been judged.
There, on the platform.
Is it free?
You really mean those?
Moronic idiot.
Doggy surely won't make you any
trouble, he'll be on my knees.
He's leaving wet traces on my light
trousers. Christ, eh...
What do I!? How do I?!
With those traces near the flt, like what I?
Like what I were doing?
I'm supposed to hold my hands
there all the time?
Nice ass. Pear one.
And she's different.
A wife, I'd say.
There's nothing worse than a chick with an apple ass.
Or a plum ass.
In the garden, there sits that royal couple...
It was the last one.
Last one!
I sleep, sleep, sleep in the night...
- Me too.
- Me too.
And I walk, walk in the day.
- And me.
- And me.
I sleep, sleep, sleep in the night.
Like chicken.
- Me too. Me too.
And I walk, walk in the day.
- And me.
- And me.
Wife.
Seducer, stupid cunt.
Well, I eat, eat, eat breakfast.
Yes?? Yes??
And I shop, shop.
Yeah? Super!
And I eat, eat, eat breakfast.
Yes?? Yes??
And I shop, shop.
Yeah?? Super!
Where do those nightmares come from?
Freaks, fucks from under the bush.
He dated with me, dated, dated.
Oh my!! No!
And I kiss him, kiss him, kiss him.
Extra!
He dated with me, dated with me,
dated with me!
Oh my!! No!
I kiss, kiss, kiss!
Extra!
He dated with me, dated with me,
dated with me!
Oh my! No.
I'm trying to catch...
...10 seconds without cackling on
the watch, but I fail.
Five seconds is too much, too.
And so 3 hours 48 minutes each one of them.
That gives 11 hours 24 minutes.
I kiss, kiss, kiss!
Extra!
Stupid cunts.
Feel the wrath of my dick, fucking layabouts.
I'm just waiting for it.
Would you be so kind to help me
take my bags off?
- No.
- Coo coo?
Excuse me?
Simply no. Does anyone help me?
You're a man after all, aren't you?
I'm totally for the sexual equality of
women and men.
I'm a real protagonist.
And you are an fully equal woman.
But you are probably not a real man.
You see us, men, only...
when you need us to take the trash to the bin...
...fix the plug... free a seat in the tram, bus.
I'm not a full man any longer, because
there's no need for me to be like that.
You are a real man.
Since my mind has been working and where
I can reach with my memory...
...these desks have always been falling.
And why?
Because throughout many years
some thoughtless morons...
...under the leadership of other
thoughtless morons...
...put lavatories in trains in the vicinity
of the wall, so that the desk
is dipped towards the lavatory!
And, if let go, it must fall down.
Tens of years, the holiest Jesus Christ...
What if Poland...
...is that pissed-all-over desk?
First class.
I'll live without that money.
No dogs, kids. Nobody's talking.
Now I feel like I'm in heaven.
Go on, go on!
And I'll go with this!
And I will play like that!
I'll be the first one on the beach.
Second...
'Cos one glance was enough...
...to notice the fucking neighbour standing
 right after the bath and looking at the sea.
I run, leave, hide, no matter. He'll catch me
somewhere else, in the middle of relaxation,
and fuck up everything.
I will have to count the resting from
the beginning afterwards.
I'll better go by myself and I'll get it over
with. After it I'll only have to rest.
Good morning, my neighbour.
I'm sorry?
Hello, my neighbour.
At last some sun.
Sun is up at last.
Excuse me...
Sun is shining!
Sun!
What's up?
I didn't succeed in my life, I wasted it.
I ran away from my first, and the only love.
And then I married without love...
And the only person I love... My son...
...has been brought up in hell of my marriage.
Just as I was brought up in the hell
of the marriage of my parents.
And the fact, that my son Silvester
will be as unhappy as me...
...breaks my heart.
Job, which was my vocation...
...turned out to be a torment
for a few pennies.
I'm being killed by loneliness.
...which I had made myself.
Noone and nothing awaits for me.
I can't see any future for me.
I'm powdered, scattered.
Burnt out, demonted...
Deadly tired, though I have not managed to
do anything during my life.
I have to stop in the race...
...though I didn't race at all.
And take a rest.
Take a rest for God's sake.
I can't hear at all.
My hearing's all right, but...
All I can hear - noise.
Maybe it's the sea, the noise, the sea...
Then...
...'cos my wife, in the shop.
Then...
- Have a good resty.
- Thank you.
After all what a relief, rolling noise
and emptiness.
I'm resting, it's wonderful.
Everyone, just for itself.
Talking. She is.
She's fucking yelling to him all the time.
He's thinking all the time, doesn't listen.
They're coming, of course, to me.
Seven metres, maximally thirteen from
me on the empty beach.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!!
The noise of eternal waves has always
soothed me.
Still, I'm resting.
Fuck!
Beach for dogs?!
I'm gonna kill the motherfucker.
I'm gonna smash the mother's fucker!
I'll make a fucking burger out of him!
Agar!
Agar.
Lie down.
Though I'm still resting.
I must rest here.
Get out!
Get the fuck outta here!
Fuck!
Once I was swimming straight forwards,
like between those lines.
Now I'm on the rampage with the doggy style.
Finally it's quiet.
A brat or something, damn.
They left a kid, alone, not so long before
the night on the beach, a brat.
Can't those assholes play in different
way than shrieking?!
I must rest!!
I must rest here...
When the soldier lays on his face,
then it's over.
Or maybe it was the other way round?
You look bad.
No, it was backwards. Laying on the face, and it's over.
I'm dying.
How come?
I won't be young any more?
I won't fix once commited nonsenses?
I thought I'd still be able to stay
with my first love.
What a grim absurdity.
To decide about life in the youth.
When you're a moron?
I'm dying, mom.
Nah, dying you say, you're a young man.
You think it's that easy to die. Drink the milk,
warm. Will make you feel better.
Oh, there's that dinner soup you like,
tomato soup. Tasty.
Bury me, next to Silvester!
Silvester's still alive, you old idiot.
Mom, get a life, Mom.
I'll put you next to me, Dad.
I always thought I would never die.
What a shame I'll die.
I feel so humiliated about that.
He was so wise.
And now he's dying.
He was so wise...
...and now he's dying.
He was so wise...
...and now he's dying!
But even in the moment of my death
I dream, that I'll meet that woman of my life.
And I'll manage to live with her through
the rest of my life.
You hit a mailbox?
Yes, she knows it, she understands it at once.
There's no: What happened...
- What's your name?
- Elzbieta.
Ela...
- Oh my God, so it's you.
- And from now on, we'll be together forever.
But noone can talk to me 'til noon.
I'll adjust myself.
But I hate, when woman watches soaps with me...
And you surely love to watch some...
You like to watch?
I don't.
Fuck! If there would exist a Comittee...
...to examine crimes against polish language,
then television should be the first
and main accused person.
I did not think about it.
It is television, which is responsible for
spreading the ubiquitous moron "likely".
Nowadays nothing is interchangeable and clear,
but "likely to be clear", fuck!
Indeed.
Or about that accentuation, fuck,
stressing on the first syllable...
...instead of stressing on the second counting
from the last word. It's also television's job.
Where did they get it from?
From political chit-chats?
Southern Poland slang?
And now everybody says "prolonging war"...
...instead of "prolonging war".
No "picnic mood", but "picnic mood".
You're right.
And there's no "in whole Poland",
but "in whole Poland", fuck, goddamn it!
I'll be turning off the sound.
And when I see those fucking balls, bangs,
twangs before ads... and those actresses...
...expressing their emotions and feelings while
washing or talking about sanitary towels.
I'll be switching off the video.
But I'm kinda fast in love.
It's nerves. You will get calmer with me.
And you'll be able to last as long
as you will want to.
But actually I...
...have no place and time for the
woman of my life in my life.
I dream about her, but...
...I have no place and time.
I won't take them away from you.
I'm only your dream.
Oh, then it's okay.
But, well, I dunno...
I don't know, maybe I'll wait
for the other one.
She'll be better, maybe I'll find her.
But how should I escape, from this one?
Don't leave me now!
Don't leave me now.
Don't leave me now!
I must write something finally, create.
In the garden there sits that royal couple.
Unpredictably I'm starting to feel better.
Where are the Lithuanians coming from?
Hah, yes yes!
Lithuanians?
And right after I come into my house...
...I instantly switch the TV on, just as
Robinson did with his surviving desk.
Fearing the empty flat.
I must make the supper.
Fuck, I don't have to do anything.
Who said, that I have to? I don't...
...have to eat supper.
I don't have to sleep.
And once again I make, prepare the supper, fuck.
Don't play there!
No dildoing above me!
Don't make your knight feel your
dandruff on his mouth.
Scurvient Total cleans totally.
[ANTl-WORM]
Fagoss?
Nah, cockoss.
If you break the air,
while being with the company...
...Antifarter will save you.
You smell nice, what is it?
Dick essence.
Dick essence!...
...is your scent.
Anx wax vaginex...
...is a (more than 40% better) training...
...of Kegl's muscle of labia minora...
...and anus sphincter.
One, two, three, four...
...five, six, seven.
How long is it going for me to change my
behaviours, which only involve every night
smoking and switching tv channels?
How many times have I achieved everything in my mind?
I have only managed not to become a communist.
Osteoporosis.
Pollakisuria...
...and no holding of the urine...
Anus bruises.
Prostate.
And, finally, cancer... by the way...
Prostatic cancer, anus cancer...
Bladder cancer, lungs cancer,
and throat cancer...
Pancreas cancer, and skin cancer.
I'm terribly afraid of cancer.
I'm afraid of everything.
Parkinson's disease.
Alzheimer's disease.
I'm afraid of the night.
Or maybe that's not the reason...
I can't go to bed.
Although I'm tired and sleepy.
Some kind of anxiety...
...squeezes my heart. How come?
Is it the end of the day?
Nothing more will happen today?
When the night gets down at last...
Before I lay down my head on the pillow...
Here I bring my prayer...
...to the God, Father, and Son...
Beat that motherfuckin' neighbo.
Asking I'm nothing for mo...
Just fuck him tighly, please.
Who am I? Small Pole.
Small, envious, and dishonourable.
What's my sign?
Bloody eyes.
Here are my prayers...
...to God, Maria, and Son.
Destroy that motherfucker.
My countryman, and my neighbour.
My enemy, my blasphemy.
Make them burgle his garage...
Make his mother betray him...
Make them burn down his shop...
Make him taste the brick like The Top.
Make his daughter with a nigger...
And generally, make him feel bad.
Make him suffer from AIDS and cancer...
That's a prayer of a Pole.
I thought...
Lithuanians?
What Lithuanians, I thought.
Because I didn't understand.
I was thinking about it all night.
And then it rang a bell.
Where... are the Lithuanians... 
coming from, am I right?
I didn't understand it at the beginning.
They are coming back from a trip...
...night trip, by the way. I thought...
I'll knock by, 'cos my neighbour spoke to
me using poems, and I haven't even responded?
Where are the Lithuanians coming from?
I didn't wake you up?
I was just going to the bed...
I thought: Lithuanians...
I won't make it 'til the morning.
I'll go, knock at the door, and tell him,
that Lithuanians...
...are coming back from a trip.
Okay, Lithuanians, you've already
told me about that...
I'd like to go to sleep.
Ahh, I'm sorry, but...
...it wasn't me who started with those Lithuanians!
You're asking, where are Lithuanians coming
from, so I'm responding.
Isn't that, what it's all about?
That's good, Lithuanians.
I didn't say it for a reason, fuck them.
Well, Mister... What do you mean, fuck them?
Firstly you start, and then you get mad?
Have a good night.
As usual I'm thinking about commiting a suicide.
If I'm not doing it...
...then maybe it's because I'm thinking of my son?
Because I lack courage?
Because I got used to it?
Because mom used to say:
You've to live on!
So I live.
A half of Tucikodin for cigarette cough.
The one with cross for headaches,
also caused by cigarettes.
And a half of Lereevon for black thoughts
before sleep and depression.
And it makes it easier to fall asleep.
And a half of Imovane...
...for first sleep.
Add a half of Stilnox...
...to maintain that dream.
Aspirin just in case.
I advise to take a glass of milk warm
before going to sleep.
Take a cold shower...
...and then wet jump to the bed.
No sleeping for one night.
Answer the letters...
And it will be easier to fall asleep
the next night.
I'd have to answer Pizza Hut or Idea.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen!
And a nerve pee.
Proform, a check.
Sounds like a galloping pony, fuck, goddamn it!
What the heck, have you rented a room
for a pony?!
Did he run away from poles?
No, it's like a thrown glass ball.
What are you doing with that ball?
Got totally kiddish?
That bouncing shit...
...is jumping on my brain!
Ball?
I'm sleeping under you!
Under me?
That's over the top, Jesus.
C, C, C W K, CWKS Legia!
My journey comrade.
You have built your life...
...blocking, like a termite,
vents to the world.
And huddling...
...in a cocoon of habits.
In a choking ritual of every day's life.
And though it kept driving you mad
every day...
...you slowly rose a creature from this ritual.
Against all the storms...
...tides...
...stars, and feelings.
It costs you enough efforts to keep
forgetting daily about your human condition.
Today the clay you are made of...
...dried.
And hardened.
Nobody will find anymore in you...
...an astronaut...
...a musician...
...an altruist...
...a poet...
...a man...
...who had maybe lived in you once.
