If you love stories
about families that stick together
and love each other through thick and thin
and it all ends happily ever after...
this isn't the film for you, okay?
This is my city. I've seen it all.
Look at 'em.
Boring people living boring lives.
I'm not judging.
Yeah, I am.
I've stared into a lot of windows, okay?
I've seen happy families, supportive
families, functional families. Ugh.
But the best stories are always
in the windows where nobody looks.
No, look down.
There they are. Hidden.
I'm the narrator, by the way.
And a cat. Get over it, yeah?
This family's story is weird, you know,
hidden away from the modern world
in their old-fashioned home.
I'll show you around.
Fantastic mouse hunting here.
When I say "old-fashioned,"
I mean they go back a long way.
A family legacy of tradition, invention,
creativity and courage.
Their greatness passed down
like their magnificent facial hair
from generation to generation
to generation.
Until this one.
- I so love being a Willoughby with you.
- Oh, smoopsy buns. I'm so happy!
Let's jump ahead a few months,
when this loving
and perfect marriage produced...
Well, you know.
- What is that?
- Oh, dear.
I'm your father,
and that sweet woman that you insulted
with your rude birth is Mother.
If you need love, I beg of you,
find it elsewhere. Thank you.
Oh, you are Tim,
and you are a Willoughby.
Good day, sir.
His loving parents
had no love left over for Tim.
All they gave him was his name.
Ooh!
Willoughby.
Oh. Willough...
...by.
Oh, and siblings.
A sister named Jane...
Our parents will hear you!
...and twin brothers,
both named Barnaby. They're creepy.
- Thanks, Barnaby.
- You're welcome, Barnaby.
Why are we staring at this wall?
Because, Jane, we are Willoughbys.
Okay, this Willoughby story
is odd, all right?
But it's not all bad. At least
they ate every family meal together.
And by "they," I mean these two.
- You like it spicy, don't you?
- Oh, I don't just like it...
I loaf it.
They just forgot to share
with their kids.
I do not predict leftovers.
But I'm so hungry
I just want to eat my own tongue.
- Me, too.
- Me, too.
Us, too.
What if we dress a Barnaby up like food...
- Bad idea.
- Terrible idea.
No, Jane.
Okay, then, what if I go?
- Stop what if-ing!
- Yeah.
No what-ifs.
I know you're hungry,
but Willoughbys do not beg for food.
We wait.
Oh.
May we have food?
- Food?
- We eat today's food.
You eat yesterday's food.
But you ate all
of yesterday's food yesterday.
So there is no food left over for... Jane!
Huh? My name is Mother. Who is this Jane?
You call your mother names,
and you expect us to feed you?
- No, no, no.
- No?
I mean...
Yes, Mother. Don't!
Don't?
You do not tell your mother
what to do not do!
- You selfish boy. You ate it all.
- No, I didn't!
Oh, Father,
I'm going to starve.
It's that girl!
- She brought the small one.
- They are creepy.
Hi, Mommy.
What are they doing here?
- Nothing.
- Bye, Mommy!
- They're, uh, going...
- Hungry.
These children, always wanting.
- We're fine. Jane!
- The Barnabys could use another sweater.
- One's good.
- We like one.
- Barnabys!
- You want two.
Stop talking.
- Look at me, I'm fretting.
- Dreadful.
- I'm all a-fret.
- Appalling.
- I can't knit!
- This is all your fault!
My fault? Wha...
Son, you insist on bothering us
with your childish needs.
Go to the coal bin!
Good day, sir.
Poor Timothy.
That's a rotten place for a hairless kid
in short trousers, innit?
Sometimes,
I wish I wasn't a Willoughby.
We used to be great.
We were soldiers and scientists,
kings and philosophers,
explorers and aviators, artists and poets!
We climbed the unclimbable,
and we always ate together...
at tables, like a family,
where every Willoughby had a mustache,
even the women.
We could be great again.
No...
We will be.
Against all odds, the Willoughby children
still had determination...
- Nice job, Barnaby.
- You, too, Barnaby.
Bye-bye, dirigible!
...imagination...
and hope.
♪ Through the glass, over the hedge ♪
♪ Follow the rainbow to... ♪
- Quiet!
- I can't knit!
♪...where my dreams begin... ♪
She can't knit!
I will be free.
If she misses a stitch...
- I feel faint!
- Oh, Mother, sweet.
Ugh!
Let's face it.
This Willoughby family isn't great,
and by the looks of it,
they never will be.
Not without a little help.
Maybe it was the dark and stormy night,
maybe I've looked in one too many windows,
but this story got to me.
I know, narrators aren't supposed
to get involved, but just a little nudge.
A well-timed cat's...
- Something's outside.
- Definitely something outside.
- Jane.
- There's something outside.
That's a yowl. A beastly yowl.
Wow! What a mystery.
It's like we're in a book.
- Come on, Barnabys.
- Bad book.
Scary book!
Shh! They're still awake.
Dance, dance for your papa.
What kind of a beast yowls like that?
I'm really scared. Are you scared,
Barnabys? 'Cause I'm scared.
Maybe we shouldn't...
Do you remember that book
about beasts with all the drawings
of teeth and claws
and huge piles of half-eaten kids?
- Don't.
- Stop talking.
It was a lot of blood,
wasn't it, Barnabys?
- Blood is bad.
- I'm gonna have a quick look
to see if it's dangerous.
If it is, run. Different directions,
zigzaggy and stuff.
- So it can only eat one of you.
- What's this feeling I'm feeling?
- Fear. Fear.
- Definitely fear.
Remember, twins, zigzaggy.
Zigzag. Zigzag. Zigzag.
Stand back, Barnabys.
I know what you're thinking,
'cause I'm thinking
exactly the same thing:
What's in the box?
And can we empty it so I can sit in it?
Hi, beast. I'm Jane.
I hope you're a nice beast
because, um, we're nice.
Please don't eat our faces.
Father, I love the smell
of fresh yarn in the morning.
Gah! Parents already up? Despicable!
Harvesting your mustache
makes such lovely yarn.
Do it!
- Mmm-hmm.
- Ugh. How am I gonna get by?
Keep going.
I knit, you provide. It's simple.
Was that always...
Oh! You want Mother to have yarn,
don't you?
You must. You like the sweaters.
Oh, pretty!
There you go. Phew.
Huh?
Jane? Twins?
Great Uncle Edmund! Shh!
They'll hear you.
We must be quiet
while Mother and Father are still...
Tim!
Here beastie, beastie, beastie.
- Jane! What are you...
- Over there.
Catch it.
- Get it!
- Get it!
Are you harboring a raccoon again?
Pfft. No.
That is something!
Is it more of a some or more of a thing?
- Get it!
- What is that?
- Aw!
- A baby!
- No thumping!
- I can't knit!
Shh!
Where did you get that thing?
We found her outside, living in a box.
She's an orphan.
- Smells like an orphan.
- Looks like an orphan.
Got a box like an orphan.
♪ Orphan friend, box all alone ♪
- Why are you singing?
- ♪ We're glad you came here... ♪
We are getting rid of it at once.
Give me that!
- No!
- Gimme! Gimme!
Jane! You know our parents hate children,
and babies are the most
childish children of all!
Well, I love her and nobody's gonna
take her away from me.
- Barnabys, bring it to me.
- Yes, Tim.
Hey! Barnabys, give me back my orphan.
- You got it, Jane.
- Barnabys, thing.
- Sorry, Tim.
- Barnabys, orphan.
- Yes, Jane.
- Ah, Barnabys.
- You got it, Tim.
- Barnabys.
- Barnabys. Barnabys.
- Barnabys. Barnabys.
Barnabys. Barnabys. Barnabys!
Barnabys! Orphan?
- Got away.
- Pretty fast.
What?
The beast is loose!
Oh, no, no, no!
Huh?
- What is it?
- A baby.
Oh, not again.
- Why does this keep happening, Mother?
- Parents!
How are you... Oh.
Parents, I got this. I got this.
Stay.
Do not move a baby muscle.
Get it off. Get it off.
Get it off! Get it off!
- Ooh.
- Roasted baby.
No!
- Mother's balls are burning.
- No.
Yes.
Ball burner.
Barnabys, catch her.
No, no, no. Oh!
Gotcha, you little rascal.
Oh.
- It's not even a Willoughby.
- Is this thing yours?
- No.
- What? No, I didn't...
You eat our food, sleep in our coal bin
and now you expect us
to rear another child?
- He's always doing this.
- What? No.
- I mean, we've tried everything.
- Ignored him.
- Coal bin.
- Neglected him.
- Coal bin.
- It wasn't me.
- Never played with him.
- Coal bin.
You'd think that would work!
Nope! Nothing works.
I can't knit!
Oh, Mother, sweet.
- Children.
- I wish we could kick them all out.
Ooh.
- I've decided to kick you all out!
- Do it, Father.
But my home!
Do not return till that thing is gone!
- You are...
- Do it. Do it.
- ...punished!
- Yes!
- This is all your fault!
- What? It's their fault.
We should kick them out.
How will we restore honor
to House Willoughby
if we are not living
in the Willoughby house?
- Ugh. But...
- We have to get rid of it, fast.
No, Tim!
Oh, the ordeal is over.
Let us return to our home.
What? What? How!
Tim, she needs a home,
and if we don't help her,
we're as bad as our parents,
who keep sullying
our great Willoughby name.
They have sullied it so much.
I know where we can find
the perfect home. Follow me.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Hello, outside!
Outside? But... I've never...
I guess it's hard
to leave home for the first time.
Although, I was six days old when I left.
All my folks ever did for me
was lick my eyeballs open,
sent me packin'.
He'll be all right. Maybe.
- Jane! Where are we going?
- To the end of the rainbow.
End of the rainbow? How far is that?
Not far. Right, orphan friend?
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Walk.
- Ooh!
- Barnabys!
Excuse me. Coming through.
Yep, sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Jane, the people! The people!
This way.
Wait for me!
Yes! Over here.
Jane! I got pee in my shoes.
Are we getting close?
We're almost there.
This looks like the bad part of town.
Self-taught.
Look at that.
Isn't it wonderful? The perfect home.
Usually
in old-fashioned stories,
rainbows have treasure at the end,
don't they?
Not this one.
"No trespassing"? Well, that's a bust.
- Look! Duckies!
- Jane.
- Factory!
- Barnabys!
No!
Hi, duckies! They're so chubby!
Barnabys! Jane!
Willoughbys do not trespass!
The perfect home. Yay!
- It's a candy factory!
- So many machines.
So many buttons.
- Levers. Levers. Levers.
- Buttons. Buttons. Buttons.
♪ Under the rainbow, I will spin ♪
♪ The perfect home for my best friend ♪
Wow!
Rainbow food? This place has everything.
- Hey!
- Orphan has a home. We go home.
We can't just leave her outside.
It's not safe.
What if there are... wolves?
Wolves?
Here.
You found her in a box?
We leave her in a box.
- Wolves do hate boxes.
- Balance restored.
Um, uh... Tim, wait!
What if we gave her a name?
A proper three-syllable name,
like, uh... oh, Taffeta!
T-A-F-F-E...
Hey!
- Her name is Ruth.
- Ruth?
Yes. Because re-orphaning her
makes us the ruthless Willoughbys.
Now be ruthless and say goodbye.
Okay.
Oh, Ruth.
I'll always know where to find you.
At the end of the rainbow.
To home!
Jane!
Who disturbs my work?
We're trespassing!
Who...
Huh...
What is in my box?
Ruth? You're not candy.
Such a magnificent mustache.
This is the perfect home.
I really hope we're doing the right thing.
Of course we are, Jane.
A great man with a great home
must have a great family.
Just imagine what
that lucky orphan's life will be like.
Ugh. I wish we had a home like Ruth,
where we didn't have to steal food
and nobody would say,
"Shut up, Jane!"
Oh, we would eat at a table
like the great Willoughbys of old.
Our mustaches would grow long,
and no one would ever have to go
to the coal bin again...
unless they wanted coal.
- I want a factory.
- Big factory.
Wait. We could have all of that.
Except for the factory.
How?
What if we became orphans?
That is your iffiest what-if yet.
We have parents.
- Bad parents.
- Terrible parents.
But what if we didn't?
It's like in the books.
Pollyanna's died of cholera in India.
James, that peach fellow's parents
were eaten by a hippo.
I thought it was a rhinoceros.
Think about how great our family
could be if they were gone.
Jane, are you seriously suggesting...
We orphan ourselves. Yes!
- Ghastly!
- Ruthless.
No! Getting rid of an orphan is one thing.
How do you propose
we discard of two insidious grown-ups?
Easy.
- No!
- No. Not there. There.
- No!
- No. There.
Wha...
...$999, and all your troubles
will be gone for good.
- You'll love it.
- Gone for good?
A folded piece of shiny paper?
We can send them away.
What if we orphaned ourselves?
Yeah. Cracking idea, Tim.
To home!
I love this plan.
Okay, humans, calm down.
Don't get all sensitive.
"Ooh! This is bad."
It's nature. It'll work out.
Look, these kids needed a change. Y'know?
I did warn you
this story wasn't all fluffy and fuzzy.
Oh, blimey, those are sharp scissors.
Watch the eyes!
We shall craft a murderous adventure
that gives our insidious parents
exactly what they want.
To be left alone with their love.
Precisely. A romantic getaway,
hiding deadly orphaning opportunities.
If they do not melt
in the hottest places on Earth...
...they shall drown in the wettest.
Cannibals will feast
unless they freeze in glacial ice,
or dissolve in fields of acid first.
They shall not escape the bears,
but if they do,
we have saved
the deadliest spot for last...
the Unclimbable Alp...
in Sveetzerlünd.
He who goes up does not come down.
The Reprehensible Travel Agency.
No children allowed.
- Behold!
- Wow.
Mmm.
Ah. Exquisite.
- What?
- Hmm?
- Father.
- Yes, poopsie.
What is it?
- Hmm.
- What does it say, Fatherkins?
- "See the world."
- See the world?
"Have adventures."
I'd love to have an adventure!
- You know what else, Mother?
- What, Father?
No children allowed!
I would love that.
Do the hula, my love.
You make me spin whirlybird style.
No. Stop. Wait.
If we leave these children here alone,
they'll ruin everything.
Oh.
What if we didn't
leave them here alone? Huh?
We could get them a nanny.
But aren't good nannies expensive?
Yes, Mother. So we'll hire
a not-good nanny for cheap.
To adventure.
Are they gullible or what?
I mean, I never thought
they'd fall for it. Did you?
Oh, you are my muse, flipsy-poop. Mmm.
Now that's gonna be a fun ride.
Go on, pick me up.
Put me in sideways.
Mother's been friends
with her fork.
Well, that was easy.
- To adventure!
- Ooh!
Everyone got what they wanted.
To adventure!
All good.
Told you this would work out.
They're gone? We did it.
- We...
- Are...
Orphans!
Whee-hee!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Orphan home. Orphan home.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Hmm...
You are punished!
Great Edmund, enjoy thy wall.
Willoughby...
Timothy,
you are the man of the house!
With great responsibility
comes great mustache.
Tim, Tim, Tim...
Tim, Tim, Tim.
Tim.
Tim!
- Tim!
- Is it morning?
- We're hungry.
- Haven't eaten in hours.
- Days. Starving.
- What's food?
I hear your childish needs,
and as man of the house, I will provide.
See?
Told you this would all work out.
Let the greatness begin.
Oh, Tim.
Warm thy Willoughby self.
Simply divine.
Dinner is served!
A proper meal for a proper family.
Delicious lobster on a bed of coal! Ta-da!
Tim, is that from the wall?
- Old lobster.
- Really old.
Old food
is the best food.
I'm going.
What? You're skipping the cheese plate?
Charcuterie mouse!
- This is getting weird.
- I pass.
I'll eat it.
What? Hey!
Where the Willoughby are you going?
Out. Ruth has rainbow food
at her place and...
We did not orphan ourselves
so you could go toodle-doodling,
eating fancy rainbow food
with your friends.
I am an orphan and I do what I want.
- No, you can't.
- I can.
- You shan't.
- I shan!
- No, you...
- Hello!
- Stranger.
- Danger.
Trespasser!
Fear not, skinny orange boy,
for I am your nanny!
No, I'm in charge!
I've read about nannies.
What kind of nanny are you?
Did you fly in on the east wind
or the west?
- West.
- Where's your umbrella?
- Here.
- Do you eat children?
- Sometimes.
- Why are you here?
I was hired by your loving parents.
Loving?
Parents?
I've got no qualifications,
but a cheery disposition.
Here to service all your childish needs.
I cook, clean... sing!
What? You sing?
- Yeah! All nannies sing.
- I sing, too.
What if we sing together?
Yeah!
Everybody, come on!
Never trust a nanny.
Ow!
Whoa!
- This is amazing.
- Yay!
- Insidious!
- I love it!
What is she doing
to Jane's head?
- Now it's pointy.
- And she looks younger.
Devil woman.
- We have to get rid of her.
- Rid of her?
- Fast.
- Ooh.
Nanny is working for our parents,
and now she's brainwashed Jane.
She has to go. But how?
Perhaps another brochure.
- How about this, Tim?
- It'll work.
What the Willoughby is that?
- It's a nannapult, Tim.
- Nannapult?
Nanny goes here, in the nanny-cup.
Lever.
- Nanny gone.
- Problem solved.
Whoa!
This is... a terrible idea.
First off, too many levers.
Do you honestly think
she's just gonna walk right in here
and plop herself down in your nanny-cup?
This is the library.
The twins mostly do stuff here.
Wow.
Did you little mushroom heads make this?
A bouncy chair?
- Whoa, it looks like a nanny-cup.
- Bouncy...
You guys are like little baby
Albert Einsteins but with weirder hair.
- What are your names?
- Lever.
- That's Barnaby.
- And that's Barnaby.
- Both of you? Okay.
- Pull it.
What if I call you Barnaby A?
- Do it!
- And you're Barnaby B?
- Lever!
- I can tell them apart now.
- I like B.
- I like A.
- I love all the levers! Or is it leaver?
- No, no, no.
- Lever.
- No, leaver.
Can I pull it?
Whoa! Fun. Ooh, what's this one do?
Nothing, huh?
- Who's hungry?
- Yay!
Stupid nannapult.
Not great. Oh, look at them over there,
chewing food in their mouths,
- eating it up. Ugh!
- Skinny Bones?
- What's his deal?
- Jealous.
- Definitely jealous.
- Yeah. It's a classic power struggle.
Hmm.
Traitorous Willoughbys.
More like Will-not-be's.
Will not eat Tim's food.
Hey, Tim.
I know you miss
your old-fashioned parents.
Change is hard. I've been there.
I think maybe you just need to eat.
- What? No, no, no.
- Come on. Here we go.
- Hmm.
- Put some oats on those skinny bones.
Tim, you have to try this. It's so good.
Way better than that wall lobster.
Willoughbys do not eat oats.
I know you can do this, Skinny Bones.
Now eat.
No, thank you.
- Eat.
- Nope.
- Eat.
- No.
- Stop it.
- You stop it.
- Let go.
- You let go.
- Eat.
- No!
You disrespect my oats, you disrespect me.
I have no choice but to put you in...
The coal bin? I was gonna say time-out.
You know, I have no choice
but to put you in a time-out.
Why in the world would your parents
ever put you in a coal bin?
Having childish needs.
- Like food.
- Sweaters.
Love.
Oh, taking in an orphan.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You took in an orphan?
Yeah, we did.
But she was a baby, and babies
are the most childish children, so...
We got rid of her.
What? Back up the abuse caboose.
Where'd you get rid of a baby?
The perfect home.
Oh, this is the worst home ever.
Poor little orphan.
We should not be trespassing.
Disturbing this great man's work.
What great man?
Who disturbs my work?
Wait a minute. Commander Melanoff is real?
Um, yes.
Wow. That is a...
That's a strong fashion choice.
- Do you dress like that every day, sir?
- I, uh...
- Are those medals candy?
- Uh, maybe.
- Can Ruth come out?
- No! Go away!
- Hey! Hey! Where's the orphan, candy man?
- Shh.
- No!
- Baby!
- Ruth!
- Factory!
Oh, diddly-do.
- May I touch your mustache?
- What?
Uh-oh.
- Baby? Where is she?
- Ruth!
This is bad.
We have to get her
before she has a sugar crash.
Oh, no, no, no. Not again.
You trespassers! Stay!
Yes, great one.
Oh, baby. No, no, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
Nuts and nougat,
nuts and nougat.
Oh, diddly-doodle.
Ah! Not the candy crusher.
Ruthie!
Gotcha!
- Ooh, that was exciting.
- Okay, but we're supposed to be staying.
Ruth!
You! Big-haired lady.
Give me back my baby!
Your baby? I don't think so, sugar daddy.
A nanny knows things,
and this nanny knows these messed-up
Willoughbys left a baby on your doorstep.
Wait, are you the angels
who brought her to me?
- Uh...
- Maybe.
I wouldn't call them angels, exactly.
- Oh, my.
- What are you feeding her?
Candy! I'm Commander Melanoff,
and I live in the land of fun!
- Whoa.
- A moving painting?
How did they get
the tiny people in the box?
Ruthie likes it, don't ya?
You like those toasty oats.
All kids love oats.
So, you're like the real
Commander Melanoff? You're famous?
Well, maybe.
I do make every tasty treat myself.
Do you live here alone, or...
Yes. Well, I did.
Ruth moved in
and she needs a lot of attention.
'Course she does, don't you, baby girl?
How could something so tiny
make so much poop?
- I haven't slept in nine days.
- Oh, that explains a lot.
I called Orphan Services for help, but...
Orphan Services?
No, you shouldn't have called them!
Well, I mean, "Find an orphan
you don't know, call..."
- Oh, oh.
- Oh, oh.
No. Giving a baby to them
is like locking a puppy up in a cage.
Oh, my! I love puppies.
It's a good thing I hung up, then.
Oh, you did?
You see, I've grown fond
of her childish needs.
I want her to stay.
Okay, but...
This factory isn't baby proofed.
She can't just eat candy
for the rest of her life.
I mean, next thing you know,
she's going off to college, she could...
She could be a doctor.
Maybe she'll write the next Moby Dick,
or paint the next Mona Lisa.
Fly an airplane to the moon.
I mean, she could be the next president.
You know? And then you're gonna
have to go to the White House
and maybe not wear a candy suit,
you know? It's a lot.
That sounds sweet.
It's time for this candy man
to become a family man,
who also makes candy.
Well, if you ever need help,
you know who to call.
Oh, the service for orphans.
What? No, Skinny Bones!
You could call me. You know, I'm a nanny.
- I will.
- Just put your number in there.
If you ever need a candy factory, or...
Ooh!
Yay! The perfect home.
Oh,
you Willoughbys are wonderful.
Here, son, catch!
Whoa.
- Is this a hug?
- I don't know. But I like it.
Aww. Unfortunately, these Willoughby kids
would soon get some disturbing news
that their parents were still alive.
They say that love conquers all.
It does for these two.
How many lives
have these cats got?
Oh, Father, I do so love
adventuring with you.
- Oh!
- Bug.
Unfortunately, Mother, our adventuring
is soon to be over. We are broke.
Does that mean we'll have to...
Ugh. Go home. I'm afraid so.
You mean, back to that old-fashioned home?
- Yes.
- Oh!
If only there was a way that we could
reach across time and space
and just sell it.
Uh, you could always use the Internet.
- Ina...
- Nets?
Uh, see here. Old-fashioned homes go
for a lot these days.
Oh, my.
Piranhas!
- What in blue blazers is this thing?
- So many pictures.
Ooh. I get it.
Irene Holmes.
Hello, we'd like to sell
our old-fashioned house.
- Quickly. Tell her quickly.
- Immediately.

That was a great day out.
I'm glad you had fun, Tim.
Must be the Commander texting already.
- Nanny...
- Oh.
What? Father?
As you wish.
Huh...
"Slide to unlock."
Okay, yeah.
Why is it not work...
Yes!
- Nanny! We're selling the house.
- Huh?
She's working for our still-alive parents!
- Tim, you're acting weird.
- Oh, am I?
We're selling the house.
- Dispose of the children as you wish.
- Do it, Father.
No.
Oh, yeah. And here's what
that Nanny wrote back.
"As for the children...
I will take care of them."
- Do you wanna be taken care of?
- I do not.
Oh, no.
Money!
Another trespasser!
Money!
Hello!
Open house tomorrow.
I'm gonna sell your home.
Money!
Oh, no, you won't.
Who could sleep
on a night like this?
Well, I could, actually.
I'm a great sleeper.
But these Willoughby kids can't.
Go, go, go.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
- Orphan Services.
- Oh, uh...
Hello, I'm an orphan in need of service.
I'd like to report a bad nanny.
Oh-oh.
Ding-dong!
The house is open!
Buy it. Buy it. Buy it. Buy it.
Like mice nibbling
at the edge of a trap,
these hopeful people were about to get
caught in the war of the Willoughbys.
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
Exquisite!
Oof!
Ha-ha.
Huh?
Oof!
Huh?
Hey.
- Yes!
- Help!
Worst open house!
Darn it!
Well done, Willoughbys.
Today, we saved our home!
While the Willoughbys
defended their home bravely...
Whoa. Where you going?
...they were no match for this.
Welcome. Right this way.
Would you look at that house?
The perfect family.
♪ Perfect family ♪
It's what we've always dreamed of.
Looks like home, sweetie!
Insidious. Go.
There's space for my roses.
- ♪ Ooh, roses ♪
- Big sister, I love you so much.
No, I love you so much, little brother.
We love you, too, kids.

But they be perfect.
Come on.
It's like the Willoughby massacre
of 1775...
Trespassers!
It's haunted!
I love you!
Something scared the perfect family?
- Beastly.
- Definitely a monster.
We'll just take a look.
Jane! No, no, no.
Shh.
What happened to our library?
- I'm scared.
- Definitely scared.
What the Willoughby?
I am the Willoughby beast.
Enter my home and I shall feast!
Eat one of the Barnabys.
Zigzag. Zigzag. Zigzag.
Leave this place and you be free,
unless thou be a Willoughby!
Zigzag. Zigzag.
It's not working.
I be a Willoughby.
Is that so?
Then I guess we're cool...
Skinny Bones.
Nanny?
Here to serve the little children.
Yay! I knew you were good.
Rubbery arms!
But I locked you up in your room.
Oh, come on, Tim.
All nannies know how to pick a lock.
Ooh.
I was building this all night
'cause I really wanted to help.
Help who? Our parents?
We can't trust her. Remember this, Nanny?
"As for the children,
I will take care of them."
Why are you being all evil?
Hear it in my voice, okay?
As for the children,
let me take care of them.
Oh.
When you say it like that,
I do wanna be taken care of.
Tim, I might work for your parents,
but my duty is to look after you guys.
I should have told you
they were selling the house.
I'm sorry.
But I just couldn't bear to break
your weird little hearts.
Oh, thank you, Nanny.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Any time, tiny girlfriend.
- Wanna hug Nanny.
- Huggy.
Get in here, you little mushroom heads.
Hug us will all six arms.
Tim, are you okay?
Thank you.
Aww, Skinny Bones.
Huh?
What?
Department of Orphan Services is on site.
- Unit 4. Cut off the exits.
- Orphan Services? We have to go. Now!
No children in or out.
Hurry, kids. Stick with me. Come on.
- Where are we going?
- Back door.
- No, follow me. Come on, you two.
- Nanny, what's happening?
It's okay. Stay together. Come on.
Come on. Don't panic.
We have reason to believe
a bad nanny is harboring orphans.
Orphans?
As a Willoughby,
I demand you leave our home.
You're the orphan.
Yes.
No, no, no. They have parents.
You leave them alone.
Linda? Is that you?
Uh, yeah.
- Linda?
- But I'm a nanny now.
Are you wearing toilet paper again?
Yes, I am, but it...
Oh, you look ridiculous.
It's a costume. I was...
Once an orphan, always an orphan.
Uh...
Nanny? You're an orphan?
No, I mean, I was. I mean... I...
I am.
We tried to find her a home,
but no one ever wanted her.
That's not true. We want her.
See? They want me.
Oh, Linda.
I'd like to report
a bad nanny. We do not want her.
Tim?
That's you? Your voice?
- Tim.
- How could you?
No, no...
Oh, children can be so, so cruel.
- I didn't mean...
- You did.
I was just trying to be a good nanny.
- But you are...
- No longer required.
No, you are required.
Go, Linda,
before these children hurt you more.
Nanny, don't. Please!
Jane...
You did this.
I didn't mean...
You lied about Nanny.
You made me get rid of Ruth.
That was our parents.
- Always just bossing me around.
- Jane...
You're a mean,
mustacheless, short-panted...
- No!
- Fighting children must be separated.
You can't.
For your own good.
No!
You will adopt
standard childhood experiences.
Homes will be allocated.
Schools will be assigned.
Until your biological parents return,
you are officially orphans.
No!
Have a nice childhood.
Stop! I don't want to go!
- Help! I don't wanna go!
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Tim?
- Jane?
Please. You can't do this.
All children
collected and protected.
- No.
- Good work, team.
These poor kids. Alone, scattered, lost.
Like me, really.
The Barnabys were cared for
in a modern home,
plugged into the Internet,
their little brains flooded with...
Well, you've been on the Internet.
Jane's hosts believed in
the healing power of music.
You okay, kiddo?
But Jane's song was gone.
Her what-ifs? No more.
Tim resisted change, running away from
well-meaning families like the Wilsons,
the Walters,
the Waddingtons.
He wanted his old-fashioned
Willoughby life back.
Sold?
No, no, no, no!
But it was gone.
No home. No family.
Someone's gotta look after him.
This is unit three.
We have him.
It's tough out there,
in the city.
Sometimes, you're the cat.
Sometimes, you're the mouse.
At least he's got a box.
Okay, it's a bit dark, but, uh, y'know.
Poor Nanny tucked her tail
and ran away from her past.
Y'know, never look back.
'Course, it's nobody's fault, really.
Fine. I'll stop the bus.
Happy now?
Let me off. Let me off!
What the Willoughby?
This is good, right? Exciting.
Oat time.
Hmph. Not hungry.
Oh, I think you are, Skinny Bones.
Huh? What...
Hungry for freedom.
Nanny?
Call me Phil.
Get in the oat cart.
I'm busting you out.
I do not deserve
this busting you speak of.
Leave me, Phil, to my short-panted guilt.
Oh, pity party, huh?
Guess I didn't get my invitation.
Sure, you screwed up.
I screwed up, too.
I left you kids there alone. I ran away.
But I came back,
and I'm not leaving here
without a Willoughby.
I'm just a Will-not-be.
All I wanted was to be
a great Willoughby with a great family.
Hey!
- Are you saying Jane's not great?
- No!
- Barnaby A's not great?
- No.
- Barnaby B's not great?
- Ow!
- You're not great?
- Okay, okay, I get it! Stop!
Look, Skinny Bones,
you have a family.
They need you and you need them.
My head protector.
Let's blow this pop stand
and do something great, bro-bro.
Let us get blowing, brother-brother.
I admire your ruthlessness,
but this is crazy.
Shh. Almost there.
I mean, uh, uh...
Just taking the oats
for a walk.
Oats love walking. Come on, oats.
- Is there an orphan in that cart?
- Uh...
Phil?
Oh, boy, orphan in an oat cart?
I've never heard of such a thing.
That's preposterous.
Uh, don't touch that.
Don't look in there.
Oh, my! My back!
How dare you?
You think oats grows in fields, Phil?
Do you know how long
we have to soak these oats
so they're soft enough
we won't choke a child?
Code Blue! She's not a real Phil!
It's Linda!
- Stop right there, fake Phil.
- Nanny!
- Tim?
- Ow!
She's stealing an orphan.
He's not an orphan.
And she's not a Linda.
- I'm Phil.
- Phil this!
Ow!
Whoo-hoo!
Gotcha.
She's getting away. Stop that Linda!
I knew Phil had a sweet car!
Nanny, the gate!
Gate, schmate. Phil ain't no sheep.
We have stories
of people in very different contexts...
You know,
it is nice to see Linda taking initiative.
Hmm.
Tonight, a skinny-boned boy
escapes a juvenile detention center.
The hunt for his...
Tim was in a box.
Barnabys.
I need your help.
- Okay, Tim.
- Sure, Tim.
Let's go!
- Nope.
- No?
What do you mean, no? We have to hurry.
No need to hurry. We got the drums, baby.
We got the drums.
Jane, please.
We're not the Willoughbys
without your what-ifs.
Hmph!
What if... I say I am sorry?
What if you did?
What if you accept my apology?
What if you stop telling me what to do?
What if you stop getting me into trouble
and stuck in a coal bin while you get
to play with orphans and eat meatloaf?
I accept your apology.
- What?
- Yay!
♪ Tim says he's sorry ♪
♪ 'Cause he was wrong
About all the things I'll list... ♪
DOS. Open the door.
We gotta go.
- Can I help ya?
- We're looking for missing children.
Oh, they've been found, mister.
Bye!
As long as they think you guys
are orphans, they will never give up.
There's only one way out of this.
You're not going to like it,
but what if we get our parents back?
- What?
- Parents?
Nanny, hands on the wheel, please.
Sorry. Sorry.
But you guys have bad parents.
Yes, I know they're despicable,
but they're the only ones we've got.
Look, the Orphan Service lady said
that if our biological parents return,
we can stay together.
We have to get them back.
Well, we do know where they're heading.
Sveetzerlünd.
He who goes up...
Does not come down.
- Careful.
- Huzzah!
Aren't these pointy hats
splendid, snugglebug?
Those pitons add such brawn
to your manly feet.
To adventure!
How could such clever kids
come from these two?
I mean,
this is Darwinism at work, isn't it?
Ugh. Do we really have to save them?
Willoughbys?
I love your factory. I need your factory.
Give me your factory.
Tonight.
Hiya, Mel.
We have to build something
to get us to Sveetzerlünd.
Okay.
- Plan A.
- Plan B.
Do it.
Whoo-hoo! Yay!
Mmm.
Whoo!
That's what I call a dirigible.
- Nice work, Barnabys.
- Good dirigible.
Delicious dirigible.
To Sveetzerlünd.
Easy, Ruthie.
All right, you kids go pee.
I'll be right back with the oats.
- Yes. Oats.
- Whoo!
Look at this.
Ruthie wants to help.
It's almost like...
They're a family.
Starting route
to Sveetzerlünd.
Ah, Sveetzerlünd.
You're gonna love it there, Ruthie.
The land of chocolate, cheese and knives.
Whoa!
What? Tim!
Do you think Nanny will be mad we
snuck out and ran off with the dirigible
and stole her phone?
- And her purse.
- She is definitely mad.
But we orphaned ourselves.
We will unorphan ourselves.
I'm alive! I'm finally alive!
Check it out.
Whoa.
As these Willoughbys flew east
towards the sunrise,
I'm just along for the ride, in this cone.
I told you this story would be exciting.
Will they reach their parents
in time? Dunno. I'm in a cone!
A-ha. Unclimbable Alp, they say.
Doesn't compare to the mounds of love
we've climbed, sweet Mother.
Oh, Father, take me to the tippy top.
What are you doing, you idiots?
Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother.
Mother, dear!
Ooh.
- Oh, look, snow.
- Ooh.
Fill her up, buddy.
- Sugar in the drain pipe.
- Sugar in the gas tank.
Good morning, we're going to stop
our parents from killing themselves.
Bye!
Yeah! Nice!
Keep up, honey, keep up!
So much better than walking.
Barnaby, Barnaby, Barnaby...
Huh?
I don't believe I can...
feel my nose.
No.
We're out of yarn.
I can't knit!
Oh, Mother, sweets.
Father, we've made a horrible mistake.
We must go back home.
Oh, Mother,
you are my home.
Oh.
You have arrived
at your destination.
There it is.
Whoa.
They could be anywhere up...
There. Look.
I suspect our parents
had something to do with that.
They do make a mess of things.
- Something outside.
- Definitely something outside.
Looky, looky.
Willoughby red. Human fibers.
Silky smooth. Father's tardigrades.
I can't knit.
Mother's yarn!
- Yes!
- We got 'em now.
Follow that yarn!
Hang on, Willoughbys!
I can't see a thing.
No visibility.
Ice to see you.
Great pun, Jane.
Oh, no! We're losing power!
Barnabys, what's going on?
- Altitude. Keep driving.
- We need more rainbow.
Faster, guys!
Rainbow. Rainbow. Rainbow. Rainbow.
A-ha! Punch it.
Rainbow. Rainbow. Rainbow!
Whoo!
Unclimbable, but not unflyable.
Look! The yarn leads right to...
Oh, no!
'Tis like a yard of graves.
Hurry!
They have to be here!
- Split up!
- Splitting!
Tree. Tree.
- Tree here, too.
- Another tree.
No sign of them.
This is impossible!
We're all going to freeze out here
if we don't find them.
I hear something.
Me, too. Definitely hear something.
Is it a some or a thing?
It is some and a thing. Go!
- Not a tree!
- It's parents!
Their kiss, it's still warm.
Heaters. Fire.
Come on. Come on.
We have parents.
- A mommy.
- And a daddy.
Children?
Ah, Fatherkins, are we back home?
No, dearest. On an alp.
We have come to your rescue.
Rescue? Us?
But how?
- We knew where you were going.
- We sent you away.
The Reprehensible Travel Agency.
The brochure?
Mother's balls! This was... you?
We wanted, um, to orphan ourselves.
- But we were wrong.
- Very wrong.
Oh, my.
Look, we are not a perfect family.
We're not even a good family.
But you need us to get down this alp,
and once we're down there, we need you
so that we can all stay together.
You don't have to love us,
but will thou be our parents again?
Please.
Oh, Father, maybe we were wrong.
We can do better.
Shall we? For love.
For love.
- Get out of my way!
- Ugh.
Would you look at that machine?
Oh, I do love to fly.
Run, Mother. Run as fast as you can.
I did not see that one coming.
- I didn't bring my running dress.
- Lift those limbs.
Here I come, Father!
To adventure!
Mother, where did you learn to drive?
I thought you were driving, darling.
Unfortunately, the Willoughby
parents remained thoroughly...
- What do these pedals do?
- Oh.
...incredibly
and utterly selfish.
Oh, dear.
Huh.
Any chance they survived that?
I don't think so.
Oh, no.
All the determination, imagination.
Doesn't matter how good you are, does it?
The world can be a pretty cold place.
We have to stay warm.
Oh, Tim.
It's frozen.
Definitely frozen.
- Hot!
- Get the hot.
No! Barnabys! No! Stay together!
Oh, the hot is gone.
Tim, what do we do now?
The yarn!
We followed it up.
We can follow it back down.
Tim! Come back! Please! We have to...
No!
It's hopeless.
Come back.
Cold.
Sweater.
No.
One last what-if.
- I heard something.
- Me, too.

It's a Swiss gyrocopter.
Whoo! There's a can opener!
That's a corkscrew.
Lickety twist!
- Oh, Skinny Bones.
- Nanny?
After all we've been through,
you abandon us? Oh!
But how did you find us?
We followed the rainbow into the storm.
Then Ruth heard your jolly jingle.
You heard my song? Wow.
It was beautiful, Jane.
I'm sure your folks loved it.
Speaking of folks, where are they?
I want to tell them
how great their kids are.
They stole our dandy dirigible.
We have really bad parents.
You mean had.
We're orphans. For real.
- What?
- Oh.
No parents.
- No home.
- No place to go.
We've lost it all.
But we have each other.
Look, we sailed a candy dirigible
over an ocean,
climbed the unclimbable.
- We didn't actually climb.
- I know, but it's a nice speech.
So as long as we stick together,
we'll be okay.
With or without parents.
What if...
We became a family?
Hi, Mommy.
I'm all in!
Diddly-dee! Same with me!
Commander, get us out of here.
It's too cold to be mushy.
Grandy dandy!
Why aren't we using the helicopter?
We don't need no helicopters.
We're family.
Okay, it's a bit weird,
all right?
But we got there in the end.
Determination, imagination, hope.
Told you I know a good story
when I see one.
The best stories
are the hard ones, y'know?
Hmm! It's not bushy.
Still, it is a mustache.
I think we know
what that means, right, Tim?
We're not doing
the great thing anymore,
since that happened.
Mustache.
Well, if you ate your oats, Tim...
you'd have hair everywhere.
Maybe hairless Tim wants something new.
I call it Melanoff meatloaf!
Ooh.
- Ruth.
- Oh, no, no.
- Ugh. Oh.
- Ugh!
Look, Tim.
Ruth has a meat mustache.
Willoughby.
Look at them,
a perfectly imperfect family.
And while they didn't get
everything they wanted...
Here we go!
...they got what they needed.
I guess we all need love. Even me.
I love my mustache!
See?
They all lived happily ever after.
Which is more than I can say for...
you know.
Oh, mushy buns,
I do love seeing the world with you.
Even the wet bits.
Nothing will stop us
from adventuring, Mother.
