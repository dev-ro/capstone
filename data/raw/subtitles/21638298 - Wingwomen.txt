[grunting]
- All good, Alex.
- [soft rattling]
I got the diamonds.
- I'm waiting for you.
- Really nice of you. Thanks.
[cell phone chimes]
[on radio] Fuck, that safe
gave me such a hard time.
And then I ran into a few security guards.
But it's all good.
I don't think anyone saw me.
- [gasping]
- I hope.
- Fuck me.
- What?
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Did I set off the alarm?
- They coming? What's wrong?
- I've got a problem. I'm speechless.
And I'm out of breath,
so tell me what's up.
[sighs]
It looks like
he's dumping me by text, Carole.
- [exhales]
- [phone ringing]
He's calling, be right back.
- You're gonna pay for this.
- Just a sec.
Hello?
Right. What do you mean?
Okay, I hear you,
but can we meet up somewhere?
To talk it over.
Yeah, maybe, but don't...
- [call waiting beeps]
- Hang on a second. I'm really sorry.
Please, babe,
I'll be back real quick. I promise.
All right, babe, you there?
Come on, Alex. Fuck, I'm lost.
I don't know where I'm going.
You need to get me outta here
before they find me.
He wants to talk about it in person.
What do you think?
- Wait, who?
- Babe, Karim.
Babe, what's the difference
if it's in person?
You're still getting dumped.
Anyway, you're with me tomorrow.
I need you while I trade the diamonds.
Stop screwing around!
- Call him, tell him to fuck off!
- Okay. One second.
Goddammit, Alex! What the fuck?
Well, Karim, you there?
Well, forget about tomorrow.
I'm so... so busy. I'm so sorry.
Oh? All right.
Yeah, six o'clock works. Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I miss you so much.
[phone beeps]
- All right, babe?
- Yeah?
- Oof, you're gonna kill me.
- Give me your position.
Otherwise, I won't be able
to find you to kill you.
Oh, yeah, that's right. All right, so...
Three hundred meters south-west.
Finally. On my way.
[music continues]
Where the fuck are you, Alex?
Babe, are you serious?
I'm right behind you.
Oh. Sorry.
It's so hard to see in this fog.
[sighs] All right, let's get going.
What's with this weather?
It was so pretty earlier.
It's fucking Switzerland.
Who cares? I'm in pain over here.
[engine starts]
All right, come on.
[birds chirping]
[Alex] You never liked him anyway.
[Carole] Look, this guy is texting you
to dump you after dating for a month.
I mean, come on.
Not a big loss, to be honest.
He had way too many red flags.
- Really?
- Oh yeah. Tree!
[engine revving]
[suspenseful music playing]
- Hear that sound?
- No, what?
- Fuck, they sent out some drones.
- Where?
[drones buzzing]
- [gunfire]
- Damn it.
Faster, Alex, hurry.
[engine revving]
[loud whirring]
Can you see how many there are?
Uh, I've only seen two so far.
[whirring]
Fuck, they're coming in
from every direction.
- [gunfire]
- Ah.
[rapid gunfire]
Hang on.
- [Carole grunts]
- [rapid gunfire]
- [glass shattering]
- [Alex] No.
Fuck, Karim won't be able
to reach me now. Bummer.
You fucking serious right now?
All right, let's swap.
You sit in the back
and take care of shooting them down.
I'm ready, let's do it. Go!
[suspenseful music continues]
- [drone buzzing]
- [gunshot]
[rapid gunfire]
[Carole yelps]
[Alex grunting]
[gunfire continues]
Fuck, what's wrong with me? I can't focus.
Just think of Karim.
- [Alex] That's much better now.
- Glad I could help.
All right. Lemme try the machine gun.
- Try to keep it stable, for fuck's sake.
- Easy for you to say.
[machine gun firing]
- [drones whirring]
- [bullets ricocheting]
- Ah!
- [whirring continues]
- [gunfire]
- [groans]
- You all right?
- Yeah.
[Alex] Wow, the second one is nasty.
I can't get rid of it.
Hang on. Nice and easy.
- [shotgun blast]
- [whirring]
Come to mama.
[shotgun blast]
Yeah!
- [laughing]
- Yeah.
- Whoo-hoo!
- [laughing]
- Ah!
- Whoo!
[music fades]
[gentle nature sounds]
- Goddamn it.
- What now?
[liquid dripping]
- Did you fill up the tank?
- Of course I did.
Oh no.
They shot up the gas tank.
- Bastards. Fuck.
- We'll have to walk.
I feel like I can still hear it.
- The drone in my head. It's weird.
- Yeah, me too.
- [drone buzzing]
- [gunfire]
Ah.
- [drone buzzing]
- [gunfire]
Fuck. Hurry, run.
[Carole] This way. Uh, this way.
Holy shit, how many are there?
You got anything left?
You're gonna fuck with me?
- [Carole] Awesome.
- I'm gonna take care of it.
- No, no. Bad timing.
- Okay.
[drone whirring]
[buzzing loudly]
- [buzzing stops]
- [drone thuds]
- You got it?
- Yeah.
Holy fuck.
This shit wore me out. Now's a good time.
Right.
[gentle music playing]
And maybe I already found him
and I let him get away.
[Carole] You haven't found him yet.
- [Alex] How do you know that?
- I just know.
Do you think I scare them away?
Why would I? I'm pretty normal.
[chuckles]
Why do I never get
a beautiful love declaration?
It'll come your way.
- And how do you know that?
- I just know.
[Alex] Oh. Wow. You're amazing.
You thought of everything.
[Carole] I did.
[Alex] A yummy bar.
What else does a girl need?
- Aw, my nine millimeter.
- Aw...
What else you got?
Wow. Now this is good.
- Mm. Chocolate.
- Swiss chocolate.
[inhales]
[sighs]
Damn it, I left my smokes in the ATV.
No, that's too much.
[Carole] What else can I get you?
I feel like asking for a man.
[laughs]
- I'm sorry.
- No man?
No man.
I keep hearing the sound.
It's in your head.
No, I swear to God.
Man, that's unbelievable. Can you hear it?
- [drone whirring]
- Now, I can.
- All right, get down.
- [sighing]
Come here. I'm ready, you son of a bitch.
- [loud buzzing]
- [gunshot]
It's like someone is
always fucking with us.
- You know?
- Always.
[Carole] I'm so tired
of doing all these jobs.
How about we go
on vacation for a few days?
[falcon screeching]
- You know what I'm thinking of right now?
- No.
[peaceful music playing]
Go ahead, lemme hear it.
{\an8}[Alex] I'm dreaming of a warm baguette,
with merguez, samurai sauce,
{\an8}French fries, and a touch of Sriracha.
Doesn't that sound good?
{\an8}[Carole] I've been
a vegetarian for ten years.
{\an8}Funny how you just can't remember that.
{\an8}[Alex] You're right, I just can't.
{\an8}Then how 'bout we only share the dessert?
{\an8}Wanna have matcha mochi?
{\an8}The soft ones, you know? Those are good.
{\an8}- [Carole] Oh, you mean the red bean one?
- The ones you always get.
{\an8}- Yeah, that's pretty good.
- What would you have now?
{\an8}What are you dreaming of?
{\an8}[Carole] This instant? Remember
those cookies they sell down the street?
{\an8}- [Alex] Ew. No.
- I really like the salted caramel ones...
{\an8}...with, um, white chocolate chips.
{\an8}[Alex] Nah, that's for
depressed New Yorkers.
{\an8}I think we should buy a fryer.
{\an8}- [Carole] We should buy a what?
- A fryer.
{\an8}- [Carole] What for?
- Well, uh, to make French fries.
{\an8}- And a waffler.
- [Carole] A waffle maker?
{\an8}Oh yeah, we use that way more often.
[music continues]
[Alex] Wow.
Switzerland's beautiful, actually.
[Carole] A panini grill.
- [Alex] Oh, that's an awesome idea.
- Yeah, it's so cool.
- [Alex] You know what?
- What?
When we land, I mean, when we get home,
- let's buy one right away.
- You got it.
[Alex] Do you know if we're landing soon?
I feel like this flight's taking forever.
WINGWOMEN
[muffled heartbeat thumping]
[music fades]
[Carole sighs]
- Here.
- Thanks.
Well, um...
How many weeks am I?
Given the size, I would say... six.
Does that sound right to you?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Yes. Perhaps.
- [chuckling]
- Six weeks, yes.
Somewhat. [inhales sharply]
It just makes no sense though.
We were always told
I could never get pregnant.
That's what the surgeon said
after your surgery,
so probably, he was wrong.
Well, he was wrong big time.
Hm.
How much time do I have
to decide if I wanna keep it?
Seven weeks if you proceed with medicine,
14 if we perform surgery.
I'm a bit, um, overwhelmed.
Listen, it's a high-risk pregnancy.
So, it's gonna require
lots of peace and quiet.
You think you could take
some time off for a while?
- Hmm...
- [doctor chuckles]
[Indian pop music playing on speakers]
- Got some semolina.
- Oh.
How about getting something
we can actually cook.
And what did you get us?
Ew. Chocolate, mint and chili?
Like, you got
chili con carne with chocolate?
Pick something we can both drink.
- What do we have left in the fridge?
- Uh...
I guess eggs, hummus, and yogurt.
Actually, how long is
yogurt good for after its expiration date?
Well, let's get more yogurt.
Okay. And, uh, You got tampons?
I'm not sure.
Let's get some more of those.
No, the tampons in here
are made from oatmeal. It's gross.
- Okay.
- Why do we even shop here?
Let's move it,
I wanna get this meeting over with.
[man yelling indistinctly in distance]
I really don't want to see these guys.
[Alex on radio] Ugh. I feel you, girl.
It smells like pee where I'm sitting.
It's okay, when we're done,
we get to go home and have expired yogurt.
What's up?
[clicks]
You won't mind if I feel you up a little.
[Alex] Babe, I'm in position.
- Did you like that?
- Just get on with it.
I so wanna put a bullet in his head.
The goods?
[bag rattling softly]
[Alex] We all have
some bad tattoos we want removed,
but what the hell has he got going on?
Is it a pineapple?
Looks like he's got
a fruit salad on his arm.
How'd it go?
[Carole] In Switzerland?
What do you wanna know?
There's chocolate, fondue, bank secrecy.
And mountains. No air pollution.
Not like here.
[Alex] His fat friend
reminds me of a Pokémon.
I'm blanking on his name, let me think.
Bulbasaur? No, not Bulbasaur.
What're you laughing about?
Nothing.
How is it, Eddy?
It's great stuff. There's approximately
six carats per stone.
Very good cut. Perfectly white.
- [Alex] Charmander?
- Holy shit, it looks rare.
- No, it's not Charmander.
- Taz.
[laughing] It's a rare gem, buddy.
Oh my God. Squirtle.
He's Squirtle with Clint Eastwood's voice.
[Eddy] Unbelievable.
Why do you keep laughing?
Enough. Where's the money?
I gave it to your boss, so talk to her.
That's not what we all agreed to.
Give her a ring.
- I guess you don't trust us.
- I don't.
Just like Godmother.
She asked us to pay upfront, that bitch.
Calm down, Taz. Take it easy.
Get the hell out, we're done.
You think I'm afraid of you?
[Eddy] Come on, guys, take it easy.
- [Taz whistles]
- [dog barking]
- [Eddy] What the fuck, man?
- [barking]
[Eddy] Taz, stop.
You see, I whistle again,
he'll bite your face off.
[Alex]Yeah. And all you gotta do is wink
and I'll smoke his ass.
[barking continues]
Now it's my turn.
If I just wink,
you'll end up in a wheelchair and
your buddy here can push you around.
Who's Clint Eastwood now, bitch?
- What's so funny?
- [Eddy] Yo, Taz.
[dog barks, whimpers]
[Alex] Surprise, motherfucker.
Come on, Carole. Just give me the word.
- [Eddy] Carole, don't fuck this up.
- Come on.
- It's good. No one's messing with you.
- Just playing.
I hope not.
- Don't make me come back here.
- [Eddy] It's all good.
So long, losers.
- [sighs] I'm exhausted.
- Wanna take a cab?
No, I'm just exhausted.
I'm exhausted of everything.
This life is exhausting.
- Right.
- These two wore me out.
[Alex] Come on, let's go home.
[Carole sighs] You know what?
- I want us to quit.
- Quit what?
All of this. I'm done with this shit.
[Alex] You say that every time.
I know, but this time
I really want us to quit.
You know we're never gonna quit.
You'll go see Godmother
and she'll tell you
"she calls the shots, she made you."
I know, but I'm seeing her tomorrow,
and this time things will be different.
[door slams]
There's the love of my life.
You all right, my baby?
You're so handsome. Gosh, I missed you.
My little guy.
You doing okay?
I hope you didn't destroy the place.
[Carole] Oh, he absolutely did.
[Alex] It's okay, Mommy loves you.
[synth pop music playing]
[Alex] What're we gonna do if we quit?
I don't know how to do anything else.
[Carole] Me neither.
Try this. Follow my lead.
We'll figure it out.
[laughing]
Well, I don't give a fuck
as long as I'm with you.
Me too.
[music fades]
[woman in film in French]
You can't start your life again, François.
There are words, big words, as you'd say,
that you rammed down my throat
ten years ago.
Love is a miracle.
Amazement.
Grace.
Birth.
Love doesn't start again, François.
[in English] What a pity.
Right in the middle of my favorite scene.
But I love you much more
than my favorite scene...
- [snaps fingers]
- [film sound turns off]
You forgot to mention they
had armed drones as security.
- I almost got killed.
- [Godmother sighs wearily]
Right now, sweetheart,
please tell Godmother stories
she has not already heard about.
All right then.
[clears throat] We need to talk.
Most certainly, darling.
It's been on our minds for...
a little bit now.
[sighs deeply]
We want out.
Out of where?
No more jobs or risks,
explosions or getting shot at.
We want out.
[Godmother sighs]
To change our lives.
Change your lives?
Like what?
You mean Little House on the Prairie?
- Maybe something less drastic.
- [Godmother] Yes, of course.
Oh, this nonsense. You're in way to deep.
I'm over it.
Would you please wait outside, gorgeous?
- Me?
- Yes.
- Why?
- No reason.
Because I asked you to. Go for a walk.
Treat yourself to
a gluten-free banana ice cream.
Or whatever.
Have a smoke.
- I'm trying to quit.
- [scoffs] Honey, don't quit.
It'll help you die young.
It's fine, just go.
[Godmother] You should know that
I'm not the kind of person people leave.
And you will learn
that we've built coffins
in cemeteries
for those who've tried to.
Is that a threat?
No, just a warning.
Godmother doesn't threaten.
Warning me about what?
- That you'll kill me if I leave?
- No, I'll get you a unicorn as a present.
[sighs deeply] You have
other people that work for you.
You're my masterpiece.
If you were half as good as you are,
you'd still be the best.
And you're the only one I can trust.
You're priceless.
Although... [sighs]
- What's your number?
- [gasps]
You know I don't care about the money.
[inhales sharply, laughs]
[laughing] That's so adorable.
[clapping]
Oh, St. Carole, tell me to which charity
I should mail the next envelope to.
[thunder rumbling in distance]
There won't be a next time.
I have enough money.
Thanks to who?
You know, I got you out of your misery,
but if I lift a finger,
you're right back where you started.
[thunder rumbling]
[church bell tolling]
[Alex] What are you doing up here?
Oh, I'm thinking.
Wow, you're spooky when you're thinking.

This is taking so long.
Alex.
- [Alex] Fuck. I think I forgot my charger.
- Who cares? There's no signal.
[Alex] Damn it!
What am I gonna do without WiFi?
- We're so far from everything.
- It's a hideout.
If we don't want Godmother to find us,
the whole point is to be hidden.
Oh my God, I am so fucking hungry.
[Carole] Been a while
since you complained.
I'm this close to eating the bunny.
[Carole laughs]
- What if Karim calls me back?
- Enough!
[music stops]
Enough.
Holy cow.
[panting] All right.
[birds chirping]
- So... you don't know where it is?
- I do.
No, you don't.
- [scanner beeping]
- Ah.
[door thuds, hisses]
[Alex] Hmm.
[Alex] Well, at least we're sure
Godmother will never find us here.
Hey, I can't stop
thinking about something.
Really?
- Wait, are you listening?
- Well, yes, of course.
Okay. Let's say that,
even though it'll never be the case,
let's pretend that Godmother lets us go.
She accepts it,
no more contracts, it's all behind us.
So, we need to switch to
something completely different.
What do we really want?
We love peace, we love nature,
we wanna have fun. Hmm?
Basically, here's what I suggest,
let's see first
how much money we have and invest it.
Pick a nice, cool place
where we would retire.
I thought about it, and I've got an idea.
You ready for this?
A rotisserie.
It's popular, it's easy money,
and it makes people happy.
You don't eat meat, doesn't matter.
You might know the reason
why some rotisseries are better
is the sauce.
A great, unique, green sauce,
so that people come for that,
drive out of their way for that.
The number one aspect
to think of when you invest is "location."
Where do we wanna retire?
I would suggest
somewhere sunny, on a beach.
This way, you handle the orders,
then you go sunbathing,
you do your little workouts... [gasps]
Please close your eyes immediately.
You're gonna go crazy.
Close your eyes. Trust me on this.
Now open your eyes.
[laughs]
[Alex] Would you like
to have one last dance before you die?
[laughing]
[Alex] Would we hang out
if I had this haircut?
- [Carole sighs happily] Yes.
- I love you.

I'm about to tell you the most

Your wife will
probably never tell you this,

ever seen on a little rat.
And, actually, I'd love to cut them off.
So, I know where you live,
and if you keep ignoring me,
just look over your shoulder.
I warned you.
Whatever you do,
I'll always find you. Ciao.
Jesus Christ, men. What are they good for?
Why'd you fucking send those people?
Nice to see you too.
Join me for some lunch?
Actually, I don't know what got into me.
You know I can be a bit paranoid.
I thought you were serious
last time I saw you.
That you were
suddenly resigning, without warning.
Just abandoning me.
Therefore, you sent killers.
You're fine.
Are you bleeding? You hurt?
You know how Albanians are.
If they wanted you slaughtered,
you'd be dead.
They were only shooting at Alex.
What's the point of
putting a bullet in her?

How much?

A bit pricey, though.
But you're a good girl.

["Amore Addio" by Brice Davoli playing]
I have a new mission.
It's extremely simple.
Zero risk. Hm?
You'll just rob something,
and bring it back to me.
It's kind of a vacation. Hm?
You'll spend your time
lounging in the sun. Hm?
You might like that.
Where is it?
Corsica. By the beach.
You'll put together a team.
You're in charge, 100%.
As a bonus, I'm well aware that
you're depressed when seasons change,
this comes with
light therapy as a courtesy.
Mm...
Because Godmother loves you.
Okay, but it's our last mission.
[song stops]
[Alex] Well, if she said
it was the last mission,
then we can
definitely bet our lives on it.
- How much further?
- [Carole] It's only ten minutes away.
But since this was
the only possible rental...
- [loud horn honking]
- [Carole] Oh. Give me a break.
What's his problem?
Move it. Just come
and run us over, why don't ya?
[horn honks]
- Hey, I was just wondering...
- Yeah?
- Abner...
- Mm?
You think he could help me
find who killed my bunny?
Yeah. Abner is not
the sharpest tool in the shed.
Sometimes he's helpful, but... no.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
[clock ticking]
[clock bell ringing]
So, tell us, what are we gonna rob?
It's quite something.
The Grande Odalisque.
Ah. Well.
It's on loan, uh,
for a temporary exhibition in Corsica.
And it should be returned one month later.
We're gonna make sure
that never happens. Get my drift?
- You mean the one by Ingres?
- Not at all.
Let me clarify, it's not that one.
Ours is the fly one.
What flies?
Wait a second. What flies?
I mean, I don't know.
You're not making sense.
[Carole] What? Wait, wait.
- Wait...
- [chuckles] Did you get it?
Hang on, hang on.
We're taking this from a wall right?
Well, of course
we'll rob this from a wall.
Please try harder, ladies.
I mean, come on.
- Yeah, sorry. My bad.
- [woman] Hey. Shh.
- [Abner] Listen.
- Hey. Oh.
We will rob The Grande Odalisque,

there's a fly. [chuckles]

- Who's the old lady?
- Well, this is her... her house. Rose.
Is she your girlfriend?
[Abner] No, no, it's complicated.
[Carole] Is she smoking a joint?
I'm the one who suggested she smokes weed.
Why did you suggest she smoke weed?
- Because she has glaucoma.
- Oh.
Anyway, um, one thing
we don't know, though,
is when they'll deliver the painting.
All right? But once they know,
we'll know as well.
- Is there anything we know about this job?
- Yes. We know where
- the painting will be displayed.
- Ah.
In a center for the arts,
which is much easier
to break into than a museum.
And that's a real blessing for us.
Oh, man, all of a sudden
we feel so blessed, really.
Do you know where
this center of the arts is?
Uh, it's a convent.
It's Saint-François.
Near a town called Sartène.
- Are you "Sartène"?
- [chuckling]
- [Abner] Seriously?
- I couldn't help it.
What a wordsmith.
Look at you. Good work, Carole.
I am "certain." In Corsica, yes.
- And do we have a map?
- No.
- [Abner] Of course not.
- Of course not.
Of course we don't.
Let me explain.
The architect firm
that handled the remodeling...
[metal scraping]
Rose, please. Rose?
Shh. We're sharing little secrets here.
So, the architect firm is in Bastia,
where you'll find the blueprints...
- Oh.
- [laughing]
- I'm sorry.
- Carole.
[Carole] I'm sorry.
- [chickens clucking]
- [cow mooing]
- [laughing]
- [Abner] Come on.
Look at you. Hey.
You got a loose screw up there, huh?
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
So, you'll need to collect the blueprints
with all the technical details,
and remember,
don't forget to meet with the, uh...
- driver that, uh, Carole asked for.
- Oh yeah.
- Hm?
- You asked him for a driver?
Well... [blows air]
- I mean, why?
- Well...
Well, what? My driving's
not good enough for this mission?
Well, uh...
[thunder rumbling]
[tires squealing]
["Barcarolle" by Offenbach playing]
- [loud banging]
- [music stops]
[metal screeching]
Whoa. Awesome.
Goddamn it! How much longer
are you guys gonna keep making me pay
for doing a little off-roading in Poland?
Off-roading? It was more like an accident.
Sounded like an idiot to the insurance.
When will you believe me?
I already told you, I saw a dog and
had to veer off the road to save its life.
- Here she goes with the goddamn dog story!
- Nobody ever saw a dog.
Hey, no dead dog
means no proof, means no insurance.
All right. You guys are brutal.
Still doesn't make sense.
- No big deal. Don't worry about it.
- We're brutal?
Okay, for the weapons,
you'll go to the convenience store
located in Saint-Florent
and speak to Clarence.
He'll get you whatever you need, okay?
I reserved a villa
and a car for you, top-of-the-line,
it's gonna feel so cool,
you're never gonna wanna leave.
You'll get to be
in vacay mode for two weeks,
and then I'll join up with you.
- We're gonna be roomies again?
- Call it what you want.
[neighing]
- [Alex] Wait...
- [Abner] Here you go, cutie.
- Wait a second. Who is that?
- This is Spirit.
[Abner] Yes, you're a cutie patootie.
- I love you. Look at the beautiful pony.
- [Rose] Oh, no, no.
[Rose] What the heck
is this animal doin' in here again?
- This is not a place for an animal.
- [Abner] Oh, why not?
And for the driver,
you'll find him at the track, at Le Mans.
Ask for Sam.
All right. And how well
do we know this Sam?
Don't worry about that.
Finding the right people's my job.
[upbeat rhythmic synth music playing]
[car engines roaring]
And what makes him an exceptional driver?
- Oh come on. Don't start hating on him.
- All right.
[driver] Shit.
Your settings are crap.
What'd you do to it?
Remind me his name?
- Wow, you're really having a hard time.
- [laughs]
I had zero downforce.
It's impossible to drive.
Sam.
Abner thinks
he's the best possible choice.
I was stuck in the Ford chicane.
What am I supposed
to do with this tractor?
[Carole] He lost his wife
in a car accident a few months ago.
She was a stunt woman.
So, be extra nice to him.
Be so nice. [kisses] All right, let's go.
Come on. Let's go.
It may not be due to my settings.
"May not be due to my settings."
You fucking with me now?
Looks like he probably killed her.
Anyway, I'm sure I'm a better driver.
[Carole] Alex.
Come on, man! How could you
possibly hear me over this fucking noise?
[car engines roaring]
[intense music playing]
[engine revving]
I told you not to charge it.
[tires squealing]
Why did you guys...
Bitch just stole my car.
[woman] I mean, this girl is insane.
Look how she's taking the bend.
- Yeah. Woo! Come on.
- What's the problem? Huh? Is it me?
I'm pretty sure
I'll never get along with him.
Will you please go order me
a ten-piece chicken nugget with BBQ sauce?
- [man] Look at her time.
- [Alex] This is pointless.
- Let's go home. I'm for real, I can drive.
- Alex, all right.
All right, there's no problem
with the settings. Sam!
Hey, Sam.
Ooh, she's Sam.
- So she's our driver.
- No.
- Yes. That woman is our driver.
- Mm-mm.
- No.
- Yes. You're so disappointed.
Sam's a girl, you're so mad.
I don't give a fuck.
It doesn't change a thing.
That was sick.
You did the fastest time of the day.
- Told you there was no problem. Right?
- It was the driver.
Hey! Days of Thunder.
[driver] Well, you know what, Tom Cruise?
You're fired.
What the fuck?
- What are you doing?
- With pleasure.
Wow.
She is incredible.
We should definitely buy her a drink.
[sighs] And some clothes.
[Sam grunts]
[Carole] Wow.
That's the deal.
And we split the money three ways.
[Sam] And how much is that?
It's a lot of money.
Besides, you're unemployed.
Not an issue, I could find one easy.
Not with that kinda attitude.
What's next for me?
Is there a try-out or something?
There's nothing normal about this job.
- You start right away, no trial period.
- What do you mean?
What if she sucks? We need to try her out.
What if we're not compatible?
- Like, besides driving, what will I do?
- Shoot guns?
No.
- You a geek? Any good with computers?
- Not much.
So you're good at nothing then?
What if I no longer wanna work with you?
Can I drop out?
- Of course.
- How about you just don't start?
Tell me about your expert skills,
I mean, besides getting on my nerves.
Here's my area of expertise. Sniper.
I can smoke a guy a half mile away
in the middle of the night.
Congrats.
Put me on any type of motorcycle
and I'll drive circles around you
like you never seen before.
Well, if we ever start a circus,
we'll give you a call.
- Thanks for your time.
- [Carole] Hey, guys, let's tone it down.
I'm sure that you'll be a great fit.
What else are you gonna do?
Alex is sweet as pie, you'll see.
So?
Let's leave it up to destiny.
- You think you're the Dalai Lama?
- Alex...

- He really did.

- Can you just butt out?
- Alex.
And the bedrooms?

[Sam] Oh, no, no.
Is that how you guys roll?

["Madamicella" by

[Alex] So, who is this Clarence?
I mean, besides being an arms dealer?
How does Abner know him?
His father is
the ambassador of some country.
And I think he uses
his diplomatic pouch for,
well, his trafficking.
Well, girls, here we are.
You sure it's this guy?
Doesn't really look like an arms dealer.
- I think he's a local.
- [sighing]
Sorry.
[Carole] Hello.
We're looking for Clarence.
You have every right.
Um, is he here?
So they say.
Oh. All right. Thank you.
[banging]
[banging continues]
Anyone here?
[banging stops]
Yeah.
Oh. Clarence?
- [Clarence] Yeah.
- Abner sent us.
[Carole] That's a cute kitchen towel.
- You came to talk fashion?
- [Alex] No.
More like Mossberg Patriots,
threaded barrel, 300 Win Mag.
[chuckles] That's better.
[Carole] Here's our shopping list.
[chuckles]
- [Clarence] Stay right there.
- I'll be right here.
Okay.
I got your tranquilizers.
You'll see I gave you a Zev M4.
And Glock custom pistol in black and gold.
Just for style.
This is great.
You can kill a fly from 500 meters,
hit your first target from 800 meters.
This'll be a real pleasure.
No problem, pleasure is all mine.
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]
Would you have a Blaser in .308?
Of course. But I have
something faster, the HK417.
- [Alex sighs]
- It's like honey.
[Alex] Oh, wow.
With a full metal jacket ammo.
These really penetrate.
I just love penetration.
I also got you a 92. That work?
Well, yeah, Beretta, that's perfect.
Here. I wanna show you something.
This. What do you see?
- It's a fruit.
- No.
A grenade.
Ah!
A grenade that looks like pomegranate.
You got it.
- And the sausage your friend's touching...
- [both laugh]
- How could you see that?
- Smoke bombs.
- Oh. Oh wow.
- [Clarence] Oh yeah.
And, so, like, um, what's that over there?
- This?
- Yeah.
It's an egg.
Oh.
[Carole clears throat]
All right. You guys went
way overboard over here.
We're absolutely not buying all that.
But, I do want a second handgun
because, uh, we got a student to train.
- What?
- Put down the teriyaki.
Man, how could you tell?
[Clarence] Gently.
Gently.
That's it.
[gunshot echoing]
[Carole] All right, one more time.
Remember, when you shoot,
the gun comes alive.

I didn't even need to watch
to know it was terrible.
It's so loud!
It's fine, you'll get used to it.
Don't worry.
- Scared me.
- You have to work on your breathing.
But first, you need to stand up straight.
- Breathe in.
- Hey, baby?
What? No, please don't,
I know where you're going with this.
Well, it was absolutely
not about Clarence.
All right, fine. It was totally about him.
- Breathe in and out...
- You're not a fan?
So, we're gonna completely
ignore all the red flags?
What? Just 'cause he sells guns
and has a closet full of weed?
No, that's fine.
It's a hobby you have in common.
All right, hang on.
You're gonna try with both hands.
Super slowly.
All right, bend a little.
Place your hand... there you go.
- Breathe in, focus on your breathing.
- Okay, then why?
Did you see his feet?
[chokes]
- We were making eye contact.
- Should've looked at his feet.
The ugliest sandals I've ever seen.
- And that's not...
- [Sam giggles]
You also had a pair of ballerina flats.
We all made faux-pas, right?
- [Sam laughs]
- Hey, focus on the target.
[mock laughs]
Breathe in.
- [inhales]
- Aim.
Keep your shoulders relaxed.
You really gonna shoot
like losers all day or what?
Are you gonna keep falling
for losers your whole life?
Are you... Go fuck yourself.
[laughs] Well, there you are.
Okay. Whenever you want.
- Yeah. That's better.

Everyone shoots guns.
This place is so cool.
Why don't we just move here, actually?
Right? That would be great.
We should live in Corsica.
Hey, watch where
you're pointing that, Sam.
- It's loaded?
- Seriously. It's loaded, and dangerous!
You have to pay attention.
- [exhales] What the fuck? Put it down.
- This is really fun. Kind of like...
[Carole] Her girlfriend passed,
she lost her job,
I bet that's pretty hard for her.
- She, uh...
- Sucks?
- You're cruel.
- Well...
She's a diamond in the rough
with big potential.
- There's plenty of things she won't...
- Won't suck at? I'm listening.
Can I pour myself a drink or what?
Nope. Look, it's empty. That's too bad.
- Here, have mine. I'm not drinking.
- Thank you.
[Carole] Uh, take this. This...
This is your Samsung
and you can have your SIM, Sam.
[Alex guffawing]
And what is it for?
To download the blueprints.
I'll explain it later.
Amazing.
Why don't you drink anymore?
Because it makes me...
What? It makes you play the guitar?
[laughing]
Rock 'n' roll.
Oh, God, she can't even put a SIM card in.
I mean, come on.
You need help, Sam?
It's okay, Alex, I'm not an idiot.
All right, dinner time.
It looks like we're eating egg soup.
[laughing] Oh my God.
Oh my God!
- You scared me.
- Sorry. What are you up to?
Midnight snack.
I was hungry.
Yeah, me too. What are you having?
- Pickles.
- Ew. But you hate pickles.
Well, those are pretty good.
But...
What?
[gasps]
Oh man, I knew it.
I swear to God, I could tell.
So weird.
- But I can't believe it's happening.
- Mm.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because...
Because what?
I mean it. You could have told me.
We always find solutions.
You're in menopause.
You're a bitch.
- Wait, why?
- I'm 39!
Well, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
You're getting old.

How the fuck is that possible?
I can hear you!
And you're not sleeping with me tonight.

[peaceful music playing]
[birds calling]
[Carole] What's up? Did you sleep well?
Yeah, pretty well.
You know what?
Last night, I was wondering,
you and Alex, how did you actually meet?
Oh, wow, Alex.
Years ago. She was 14.
She had just run away from her family.
Just like I did.
I met her in Amsterdam,
I was working on a diamond heist,
not sure how it happened.
I, um... I had an intuition
that she was trustworthy
and I partnered with her on a job,
and she's never disappointed me.
I've always believed that
it's not what you do that matters,
- but who you do it with.
- [Sam] Mm-hmm.
[Alex] Hey. You had a good breakfast?
- [Sam] Yeah.
- Slept okay?
- I did, thanks.
- Awesome.
Meet me in the front. You're gonna suffer.
Good luck.

- For fuck's sake. Just watch how I do it.
- Why don't you do it?

- You told me, "Keep doing that."
- Stop pointing your weapon towards me.

- Yes, Josée. Thanks for calling me back.
- Are you okay?
Uh...
- Are you okay, hon?
- No, no, it's just...
No, I'm doing great.
I just wanted to tell you...
Tell me.
I wanna keep it.
Oh! Amazing. I am so happy for you.
Mm, right...
Yeah. You'll see, it's going to be great.
Mm. Thank you so much,
I'll call when I'm back in Paris.
Call me any time.
- Thanks.
- Take good care of yourself.

[Alex] I gotta admit, I went a little hard
on her training just for fun.
I totally messed up on the pasta.
No. It's really good.
It's just a bit too salty,
but it's really good.
It is way too salty.
Nah, it's all right.
[Carole] No, it's disgusting.
[Alex] No, it's not.
[Carole] I messed it all up, I...
I was ready to prepare
something nice and healthy,
but suddenly, I don't know what happened,
I just completely messed up.
[Carole sobbing]
I have no idea what I was thinking.
- Thinking about what?
- Well, I wanted to make zucchini.
I wanted to sauté some veggies,
it's super simple.
[sniffling]
But suddenly I changed my mind
and then I wasn't sure...
[sobs]
And next thing I know, I was
making something super complicated.
Calm down. I promise
it's all right, it's not that important.
I should've opted for some
pasta with butter, which is super simple,
but I don't know what happened.
Babe, I'm serious, look,
this food's delicious.
I'm gonna eat it all.
- I promise it's delicious.
- Because you're a sweetheart.
No, because your food's amazing.
[Carole sighs]
- Because you're hungry.
- I'm not really hungry.
[laughs]
I'm sorry, I'm a little anxious.
I know, I feel you.
- So, for the blueprints,
- Hm?
I've been thinking,
- Tell me.
- You'll do it with...
You'll do it with Sam.
Oh, no.
Yes, you will.
- No one will be in the office.
- [sighs]
This is the easiest part of the mission.
You just have to not set off the alarm.
Okay.
You won't need me.
She's ready.
[Alex] She looks super ready.

[church bell ringing]
[motorcycle engine revving]
All good? You standing by?
[Alex on radio] Yeah, I can see you.
Hey. Don't look at me.
Sorry.
Okay.
- I said don't look at me.
- Oh shit.
[suspenseful music playing]
[Alex] Keep going, Sam,
it's just a hallway.
You can make it through, I believe in you.
There are no alarms.
Believe me, this is easy.
- You find the office?
- I think so.

Great job on keeping the noise down.
Okay. There's the computer.
[sarcastically] Wow, you're so good.
Alex, keep fucking around,
I'll take my earpiece out. Seriously.
- So...
- Fine by me.
- Take it out. Hope you don't die.
- [Sam] Okay...

To see if you can stay focused
while you're multitasking.
I'm a woman
so I multitask all the time. But thanks.

It worked.
I logged in.
All right.

- I found the blueprints. Cool.

such a great job, right?

a record time or something.
Right. I mean, just as a reminder,
it is ridiculously easy today.
And, seriously, compared
to how Carole and I started,
you're totally unprepared.
- Meaning?
- Our first job was a diamond heist.
So, first off, trust me, we're really not
talking about the same amount of stress.
And, in fact, um...
we were almost out of the building,
I messaged her...
Fuck. Some men are coming your way.
Who was it?
No, there are men coming your way, Sam.
- My way?
- Ten of them.
Kidding, right?
No. I'm not kidding this time.

- [Sam] Alex.
- What?
What have you done?
I did my job, sis.
There's no need to thank me.
[intense music playing]
Well, thanks.
[glass shards clinking]
I see one that's not sleeping.
Alex, do something.
[Alex] Oh, fuck.
Can't you do anything for yourself?
Just think of your training.
Knock him out or shoot him in the face
You can do that, right?
[Sam] Don't let him
hit the alarm, Alex. Please.
No ammo. We're fresh out.
You do something.
I'm paralyzed, I can't move.
I'm frozen. Alex!

Actually, you suck.
Please, do something, Alex.

I'm gonna kill you. Sam. Goddammit!
[Sam] Woo!

Did you really have to ride so fast?
We just went around
Corsica in five minutes.
Why are you yelling at me?
We lost them, didn't we?
We lost who?
Who's been chasing us from Bastia? Nobody.
Ugh. I'm gonna puke my guts out.
I messed up, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- [Alex sighs]
Anyway, you did all right.
Appreciate it.
[Sam chuckles]
My visor's down.
[bleating continues]
[Alex] How are you? Not too tired?
[chuckles]
I'm fine.
What about you guys? Did it go well?
It went amazing.
- We got the files?
- Yup.
Thanks. Here.
And did you get along?
Are you guys friends now?
- Hmm.
- Well, we are.
- Well, I guess.
- [yelps]
- [sighs]
- [spitting]
[Alex] Yeah, we get along pretty well.
But, man, I'm so bored right now.
- So fucking bored.
- Mm, are you?
I gotta either
fall in love or fuck somebody.
Otherwise, I'm gonna lose it.
I'm talking anybody.
- One, two, three people...
- Why not?
- Let's meet up with Clarence.
- That would make one less to find.
Plus, I found roller skates in my bedroom.
You guys should see on those.
I am beyond good.
Just... Just relax, girls.
If we let go,
you're gonna fall on your face.
Hey. Wow. What is going on?
This village fair is legit.
It's super cute.
They have a bunch of local foods.
They're playing bocce.
Let's get ice cream!
[Alex] Now we just gotta find him.
You see him?
- Who? What?
- Clarence.
- Fuck...
- Alex, we just got here.
- He told me he'd be here.
- We just got here.
- I'm gonna see if I can find him.
- You're impossible.
I'll go grab a bite.
[Carole sighs]
[indistinct chatter]
[guinguette music playing]
- He looks like a perfect match for you.
- Mm-hmm.
- But I don't need anyone.
- [laughs] Oh yeah?
What about you? You're always thirsty.
He's not bad, right?
- Oh, forget it, she's under a spell.
- [Sam] What do you mean?
She waiting for her prince,
like Snow White
in her coffin made of glass.
You can say you want,
she won't hear a peep.
I might tell her, for example, that, uh...
she's going to get tired
of running around trying to find somebody.
She should try loving herself a bit more.
She could consider that
it's time to be on her own.
In her house. Have a pretty garden,
Ah, la, la.
Well, we both know
that's not gonna happen.
What happens next is,
Prince Charming arrives in stinky sandals.
And she'll be ready to start the party.

[Sam] My girlfriend's name was Emily.
When her and I met,
she looked at me right away.
I didn't pretend to be someone else,
I didn't need to.
And ever since she passed away,
I feel so alone
without her loving eyes gazing at me.
It's freakin' crazy how much I miss her.
[sobs]
It's so horrible to lose someone
who's always been there for you.
[inhales shakily]
I am here for you, Sam.
We all are.
[band playing
"Je l'aime à mourir" by F. Cabrel]
Um, uh... so when are we gonna bang?
Wow, you're really romantic, aren't you?
Would you prefer
a boat cabin or a beachside villa?
- I'm surprised you're romantic, actually.
- It's because of you.
What?
That I'm romantic.
I have no idea what you're talking about,
but I vote for whatever's closer.
- Over there.
- Perfect.
Now help me before I fall on my face.
- Make sure I don't die before we fuck.
- Oh no. I got you.
[song continues]
Wait. There's another guy.
No, there's no one else.
There was Karim, but that's over.
No, in the bedroom.
There's another guy right there.
Good evening.
Good evening, sir.
- Wait, do you know this guy?
- No. Do you?
Course not.
- [Clarence] Are you in the wrong room?
- Actually, no.
I, uh, was watching you earlier
as you two were dancing,
and, um, you're a lovely couple, yeah.
And, so I was wondering
if it would be possible to, um...
[inhales]
...participate?
[scoffs]
Wait, what?
Sorry, but what are we talking about?
You two.
[Clarence] Whoa.
You never done it?
Well, no.
- So, you don't wanna try?
- Well, no.
[Alex] Why? Sharing can be romantic too.
It's okay to be nervous.
- No...
- Please, you should trust me on this.

[Clarence] The guys you asked me about,
the Albanians who killed your rabbit,
I found them.
Their boss is called Skender Lulgjaraj.
- What do you know about him?
- Baby-faced, big black eyes
He has two clubs on the coast,
but he's based in Bardi, Italy.
He's flashy and he's always
talking about how much money he has.
- Okay.
- He's a bad guy, he's dangerous.
Great.
- Promise you'll be careful?
- I will.
[stressful music playing]

[Carole] I don't really like

Listen, I woke up this morning

I missed you.
What is it you want from me?
Listen, your new recruit...
are you finally gonna
replace the other one?
No.
I want them both.
[music continues]
- What do you want?
- What I want?
Just to be right here,
with the sunshine of your love.
With you.
Do you remember our first missions?
When it was just the two of us?
We were the best team.
And now, when you
deign to give me something,
it's only for work.
Like our team was all about work.
[sighing]
Are you jealous?
Or melancholic?
I'm much more than that.
Yes, you are.
[music stops]
I missed you, Alex.
Did you have fun last night?
Tell you about it later.
I found the bastards who killed Santos.
Let's go get 'em.
- Fuck. What happened to your face?
- Oh, nothing.
I mean... isn't it a bit dangerous?
So what?
Babe, we're not really prepared.
- And?
- Okay.
I should tell Sam,
see if she comes with us.
Okay.
- Cool. I'll go find her.
- Okay.
- Sam?

We're taking a ferry to Italy tonight.
We're gonna get revenge for my bunny.

[Alex] What's up, Abner?

Hey, I'm Sam.
- [Alex] Hello.
- I know.
I'm Abner.
That's Rosa, this is her farm.
{\an8}THE GREAT ODALISQUE
[Abner] Right. Let me explain.
- So, we doing this tonight?
- No. Tomorrow night.
Why? What are we
waiting for, robbing season?
Funny. No. It's the Ajaccio-Bastia derby.
The guards will be glued to the TV.
So, they'll only patrol at half-time.
It's very important that you
wait for my signal before going in.
You stay hidden in the chapel. Okay?
Don't move until the second half.
Okay.
[Abner] The painting is
displayed on the top floor.
You will come from the tunnel
so you'll have to... mm-mm.
- We'll go up?
- Hey. That's it.
- Yeah. We'll go up.
- You got it.
What about me? Where will I go?
You will wait for
Alex and Carole in the car.
When you have the painting,
we all meet up at the gazebo. Hmm?
All right, that's how we get out.
How do we get in?
You don't have to worry about getting in.
You'll already be inside.
- Ever heard of the Trojan Horse?
- Mm-hmm.
We'll do the same thing the Greeks did.
Just that simple.
- Do you guys know what they call me?
- No.
- [Sam] What?
- The Brain.
- You sure?
- Oh yes, I'm sure.
They love to call me that,
especially behind my back.
[Carole] That might be sarcasm.
[laughing]
And where will you be?
I'll be in the food truck

hot dogs.
Is that clear enough for you girls?

- [Abner] Hi, Sam.
- What's up, Abner?
[Gregorian chant playing]
[Alex] I'm wondering.
Do I know the father? Did I ever meet him?
[Carole] No, it was a one-night thing.
He doesn't need to know about it.
[Alex] This is insane.
You're having a baby without a man.
Just like I imagined it.
Except I thought I'd carry it.
[Carole] Right. Well, I'm sorry.
It was a surprise for me too.
[Alex] That means she won't look like me.
Too bad. Could've had
my body and your wisdom.
[Carole] Fuck off.
[Alex] And you know what?
I'm done waiting for Abner.
I'm already getting a cramp.
[Carole] What are you doing?
It's too early.

Trojan Horse thing was stupid.

Both of us are out now.
Abner?
Come on, pick up.

All right, then I would like
one hot dog and an order of fries.
It's from production, right?
Yes. Uh... of course.
Let me get set up.
[man] Guys, production team's
ordering hot dogs, come on.
- [Abner] Rosa, help them.
- One hot dog, dude, please.

[Alex] Holy shit,
this is a treat. Look at that.
- Clarence gave me an Extrema Ratio.
- Oh, so cute.
That's love for you.
Oh my gosh.
He even put a pair of infrared goggles.
Calm down, calm down. We're not
gonna use all this stuff, are we?
- Fine. I told you.
- What?
You're gonna be a very annoying mom.
- I will make up for it.
- [radio beeps]
Well, Sam, we're going in.
We came out of the statues.
If you speak to Abner, you tell him that,
and we're... we're moving forward.
Abner? Abner, can you answer if you copy?
- Hey. You have to move.
- What's...
This is reserved for the trailers.
- I'm sorry, what?
- Didn't you get the layout for base camp?
- No.
- Of course.
Because nobody cares about
the call sheet, anymore. Am I right?
- I'm sorry, what do you want from me?
- Can you go over there?
- Uh-huh.
- Thanks.
Mathew. Mathew for Leo. Do you copy?
- Mathew. Mathew to Leo?
- Abner?
Abner, I'm not sure
if you're there but listen.
First off, the girls are going in.
And a girl walked to the car
demanding I move it.
Was that part of the fricking plan?
'Cause I'm going to a new position.
And... I don't know
what a call sheet is. I'm sorry.
[Sam] Girls, you heard that, right?
We got company at the convent.
[samba music resumes]
[Alex] Hang on.
Oh, this is whack.
I'm not into tranquilizers.
I prefer real bullets.
Yeah, but they're real guards.
We can't kill real guards.

is 2-0 for the Bastia team.

[Carole] We should go up.
I'm not getting a signal here.
- Sam?
- [Sam] Yeah, Carole?
[Carole] Yes, finally.
Are you ready to go?
Kinda, but I had to move.
I can't stay here either,
I'll be in the field.
What? You're in a field?
What are you doing in a field?
Duh, the field of view for the camera.

The camera? What is she talking about...
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you?

[Alex] Awesome.

sequence number two for continuity?
[woman 2] I checked everything.
I just forgot the color of the boa.
- [woman 1] She should check the script.
- [woman 2] Okay,
[woman 1] We also need to
tighten Mylène corset again.
[woman 2] Yeah. And she
has to go to hair and makeup.
- [woman 1] Yeah.
- Lunch is early today.
[woman 1] What time? Very important.
[samba music continues]
[indistinct chattering]
I can't believe it.
Uh, should we cancel? Reschedule?
[Carole] No, no, we won't cancel anything.
We use it as a diversion
and we'll leave quietly,
as if nothing ever happened.
Okay.
Abner for Carole.
- [order bell dings]
- [Abner] There you go.
[woman] I'll take two hot dogs,
both with ketchup.
Mustard?
Oh, missing an order here.
- One hot dog with fries.
- [music stops]
[Carole] How could Abner
have missed such a thing?
- [Alex] Are you really surprised?
- No.
- [man on TV] You can feel the tension...
- Ah.
- [Alex] Oh, another surprise.
- Yup.
Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.
- Affoufable!
- [grunts]
- Hey!
[groans]
[grunting]
- [Carole] Hang on, let me through.
- Sure, go ahead.
Man, you're impossible.
- Why aren't you taking anyone's advice?
- What?
Your OBGYN said "no physical effort."
And "save your energy."
Okay, I'm not ill, I'm pregnant.
What I shouldn't do is carry things.
So, can you take care of that?
You girls are really killing it.
What does "affoufable" mean?
Yeah, affoufable?
I have no idea. I made it up.
[samba music resumes]
[Alex] Holy fuck. It's hot in here.
[unzips]
[Carole] So, here we go.
[softly] Shit.
- [Carole] Alex?
- What?
There's another guard,
he's just behind me.
Can you deal with him, please?

[Sam] Okay. Well, I'm in position,
but it's a different position.
I have to go
to another position, so let me...
I'll reach out
at the last minute with the location.
- [crew] Hey. Not here.
- Right. Yeah, I know.
I gotta move it. I hear ya.
Yeah. So you can park
next to the grip truck at base camp.
There's another truck
coming with the projectors.
And come back to help us
in the green room for Mylène. Got it?

was total bullshit.
Can you guys hurry this shit up?
So, I need to reorganize this room.
Wow. This exhibition really blows.
[samba music resumes]
[music stops]
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Holy cow.
I was told that there would be guards,
but actually we can see the paintings.
Cool, huh?
And now with
the light from the spotlights...
it looks amazing, doesn't it?
- Right?
- [Carole] Yeah.
Oh, God. He's so annoying.
Can you just tell him to shut up now?
[guard groans softly]
Uh... what are you doing exactly?
I'm cutting the false canvas.
Oh.
As was part of the plan that we...
that we had with the... decoration team.
Wait, that's a fake painting?
Yes, of course.
- Oh fuck!
- [laughing] Imagine?
Okay, all right. I understand.
- That's why there aren't any guards.
- There ya go.
Fuck, of course. I'm a moron.
The real ones are worth millions.
Of course. I'm an idiot. [chuckles]
Right. Anyway, it's cool.
It's not every day we get
to work with such a big star.
Shut the fuck up.
You know what I mean? It's crazy.
Shooting a video for Mylène Farmer, huh?
Oh, wow.
What! No fucking way. [gasps]
- It's crazy.
- Are you serious?
- Mylène?
- [Carole] No?
- Yeah.
- Yes? Yeah.
- You're obsessed with her.
- Mylène.
- Mylène
- Me too, I love Mylène.

but we won't change the plan at all.
You can come out of the statues.
It's showtime!
No way.
Well done.
Time for a champagne.

- Yeah.
Now it makes more sense why
you have so many girlfriends.
Oh stop.
- All over the countryside.
- [cell phone buzzing]
- Thank you, Abner.
- Yes. Thanks for calling me back.
[man] Yeah, they gave me your message.
Go ahead, tell me.
I need your help with something.
Okay. Is Godmother involved?
No, no, she's not.
Keep Godmother out of this.
For the moment.
- I'll put a team together.
- Okay.
I'll call you back with more
details about it later. Thanks.
Sure, you're welcome.
- Who you talking to?
- You.
So, I talked to Clarence earlier,
he told me he's going
to spend six months in Mexico.
So I was like, "What about us?"
And he was like, uh,
"Well, I need to go off on my own,
I can't have you saving me forever."
That means "Goodbye," right?
Thought so.
You know I love you.
Me too.
Anyway, soon I'll be busy with the kid.
And tomorrow we make
our last delivery to Godmother.
Then we're free.

[Godmother] Ah, pop art.

to everything kitsch.
I told you Carole was the best.
Is my transfer done?
Gentlemen, it's been

So, do you like my color?
It's surprising.
Don't worry.
I'm still the darkest blonde.
We need to chat.
Of course, my darling.
Let's go over there, yeah?
It'll be quieter.
[Alex clicks tongue]
Damn it, she's moving.
[tense music resumes]
[breathing heavily]
What a bitch.
Carole, I have no more visibility.
So, don't move an inch. Okay?
I've memorized exactly
where you're standing.
Listen to me carefully.
There are two stories.
One is called fiction,
the other is reality.
I don't care about fiction.
This is real.
I'm sitting with my back to the window.
Yes, me.
[chuckles] And, I know what that means.
So, I'm going to explain what's next.
I'm not going to move.
Alex is going to form
a team with that new girl, Sam.
And you're gonna stay with me.
Nobody dies.
Nobody is sad.

Did you hear me, Alex?
In your stupid earpiece.
Do I need to repeat myself?
You know that I don't like
to repeat myself. I hate that.
Oh, fuck. What's happening here?
You afraid?
I trust you.
- What about you?
- Do I trust you? No.
Never.

We'll never find out.

Are you crazy or stupid?
I'm much more than that.
I know.
But remember...
if I bleed, so will you.
Alex.
[intense music continues]
Noon.
[music fades]
[people screaming]
[Sam] What's going on, guys?
Don't tell me I just killed Godmother.
[Sam] Her bodyguards are on the way up.
Remember what we were doing
the first time we met?
All right, stop talking to me.
[music continues]
Fuck. There's guys at the door.
Don't move. I'll keep you covered.
[officer on radio] Active shooting
situation has been reported
on Eugène Manuel Street
in the 16th district.
[Carole] We were in Amsterdam.
You were sitting at a café terrace.
You were arguing with a guy.
And you threw him in the canal.
[Alex sighs]
I loved you right away.
[chuckles] Right away.
- [gunshot]
- [grunts]
Back then, when guys pissed you off,
you beat the shit out of them.
- [gunshot]
- [grunts]
I hope you have a plan for later
or else we're both fucked.
- [gunshot]
- [groans]
[Sam] Guys, the cops just got here.
[sirens wailing]
[officer] Back up! Ma'am, get outta here.
You can't stay here.
Fuck, I don't think I can get them all.
[gunfire]
Back then you didn't talk so much shit.
What the fuck are you doing?
I've been watching you
for the last few years, losing yourself.
I don't give a shit about that.
I'm trying to focus.
- You're so scared of not being loved.
- Stop.
You accept anything from anyone.
Enough.
[Carole] It's not your fault
you only find assholes.
It's not you.
[sirens wailing]
Very few men
are able to love a girl like you.
[gunshot]
Because girls who are kind...
- [gunshot]
- [glass shattering]
...smart, funny...
[gunshots]
...women who don't
need to be protected, well...
[sighs] It's not easy to love them, it's...
it's scary.
I wouldn't be afraid
to love you if I was a man.
[gunshot]
[Carole] Can you promise me that...
That you will take the time
to let someone into your life who...
who deserves you.
I'll promise you nothing.
If you keep going with Sam,
you'd be free, you'd be your own bosses,
you'd make a great team.
I don't give a fuck,
it's you I wanna be with.
Fuck this game. Tell me what to do!
I won't make it, we know that.
Come on, Carole, focus, I beg you.
Think about the baby.
We're gonna be a family.
[door handle clicking]
This is no life for a baby.
[Alex] No, please, not like this.
Just go up on the roof.
Figure something out,
do something. Please!
- [bangs]
- [grunts]
[siren wailing]
[officers clamoring]
- Alex?
- [Sam] Carole, they're in the building.
- [Alex] Fuck.
- Move.
Just jump off the roof, Carole,
please find a way.
Please don't leave me alone.
[Carole] Alex, you need to go.
[emotionally] No.
I can't do it without you.
Of course you can, my love.
You're the strongest.
You've always been the strongest.
I'm sure you're gonna make it. Now move.
No, I won't.
You do as I say. Now. You move!
No, Carole, please.
Move! For once in your life you need
to get the hell out of there, you hear me?
Don't you see I'm doing it for you?
They stole so many years from us.
Go on, split. You're free.
- [panting]
- [footsteps approaching]
[music fades]
[sound muffles]
[police, faintly] Put your weapon down.
[indistinct yelling]
[muffled gunshots]
[panting]
[gasps]
[breathes shakily]
- [panting]
- [normal sound resumes]
[on radio] We have an active shooter
with five people injured.
[dramatic music playing]
[officer] There's a sniper. Take cover.
A sniper on the third floor.
I can see him.
[police radio]
There's a sniper across the street.
Alex, they spotted you,
they're coming for you.
Leave your weapon.
I'll take care it. Come on.
You gotta get out of here.
[sirens wailing]
[footsteps pounding]
[cocks gun]
[panting]
[banging]
Goddamn it...
Fuck.
I'm not gonna make it.
- [Sam] Alex. Take a deep breath.
- [sobs]
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Focus.
Focus and find your way to room 82.
It has access to the roof.
All right, 82.
[door rattles]
Oh fuck.
[dramatic music playing]
AMBULANCE
[music continues]
[music fades]
[birds chirping]
[intriguing music playing]
[gate creaking]
[music continues]
[Alex] Want some coffee?
[Sam] Coffee?
After four years, that's it, Alex? Coffee?
Not even a kiss or a hug? Nothing?
Not even a "It's really great to see you,
but I'm sorry, I never paid you a visit,
I was too fricking sad."
I mean, you're right, I was too sad.
[birds chirping]
I called you so many times.
I know.
- My phone gets incoming calls also.
- Oh really?
- [laughs]
- I bet it's a recent model, right?
Want some coffee?
Mm-hmm.
[Sam] I came to find you
because I need you.
And because I miss you.
Just one round trip, I promise.
One last time.
[Alex] I haven't
touched a gun in three years.
I'm not here to recruit you, sweetheart.
I just want you to come with me.
If you're bored, just fly back.
You have ten minutes to say yes
or I'll trample all your tomatoes.
They're absurd.
[laughs]
Not possible, sorry.
[horse neighing]
[wind whistling]
[horse snorting]
So...
[horse nickering]
What are we doing here?
[cloth flapping]
[sniffles]
[toy gun sounds]
Can you tell me your name?
Raoule, spelled with an E.
