We all ALLAH solders
We're hijacking this airplane
in the name of ALLAH
We are HIS soldiers, cover your hair
Cover you hair
Sit down
We are the GIA, I
order you to stay put
- Understood
- Cover yourself
Cover yourself
- We will die for ALLAH
- This is bad
Take off immediately
I can't the boarding steps are
still attach to the plane
Then call and tell them
to remove the steps
Allahuakbar
Cover your hair
Hello we are the GIA
We in control of this plane now
remove the boarding steps
at once, understood?
Remove the boarding steps!
No I don't know
we just heard about..
200 passengers, 4 horrified hijackers,
4 men for sure
- A woman maybe with them
- Who told you?
We Imbaladers team
share information,
but you wouldn't
understand that Carole
Go to hell
Transfer all the important
call directly to the crisis unit
Thats been done, blinds 4 is all yours
I want to be first one
to know anything, got it?
Now this hijacking got
the GIA written all over it
The question is, what
is their objective
Our agents will attempt to make
contact with their
leader Djamel Zitouni
The GIA works in an
independent cell,
months can go by before the
cell leader contact Zitoyni
Zitoyni may not be aware of this
that may be so Carole but I
want put a face on all this
so we can negotiate with someone
for now the Algerians
government is
rejecting the idea that the
French intervention on their soil
Leroy investigate all the
way we can get around them
We bring back the airplane
to France without losing any lives
The moment it enters our airspace
the hijacking become a French issue
This may be very well
end in a blood bath
I don't want a single drop
landing on my scene
Leroy
Warn the GIGN
Go
An Air France plane was
being hijacked in Algiers
we have orders to do an intervention
drills, they're waiting for me
Ok gentlemen get ready
How about the work force?
full deployment is in affect, all
men with enough 300 miles
radius is on their way to the barracks
call those on leave
who haven't left yet
Roger that sir
No, not this time
I need your help here
in the office and with the families
- Yes commander
- Thank you
Shit
- Can we give this away?
- No, of course not
Before we leave you, we have
breaking news form Algeria
and from France as well,
just moments ago, Air France
issue a press release
one of their airplane
which was headed for Paris
has been stop at the Algiers airport
The aircraft is currently
surrounded by armed men
Mummy

I repeat remove the
boarding steps immediately
Remove the steps now!
Take the step away
Let the children and the elderly
go and we will remove
the boarding step
Josef, come out here
I would be happy to let the
children go they just a nuisance
We just end up wasting precious
time getting them to shut up
That's a good point
- Bring the cop over here
- Alright
Move it, go
Listen closely, we're sending you
 with a message for the government
tell them we demanding
Abassi Madanii and
Ali Benhadjar be set free
at once, is that clear?
Is that clear?
now get out
Carole Jeanton,
they're waiting for you
President and prime
minister will be listening in
The hijacker just kill a hostage,
an Algerian policeman
In Algiers, The President is
withholding information from us
He refuses to considers
GIGN involvement
It's all happening on their soil
true, but the plane
is legal in embassy
How would France look in
the international community
if we don't intervene
we have to show our fangs dammit
We have no choice
As you can see in this live footage
the hijacker has began
freeing women and children
Are they letting everyone go?
No, just the women and children
The freed passengers
appear to be in harm
So how does it go with Favier?
oh he left me
Sir, how long do your
first mission last again?
17 hours behind a rifle
It was cold, thats insane
- We waited 10 hours
- 10 hours? Wow
Be right back
I know, I have no business
being here right now
it's ridiculous
I can't do it
I feel like I'm going crazy
It's on every channel on TV
I don't want you to go
I don't
We pick them up and bring
them back nothing more
That's it
I know
So?
- See you tonight
- Tonight?
Come on sweety
Bye bye daddy
We're not scared of you
You huskies
Traitors
You don't move, you stay here
- Sit down
- Traitors
We need your cooperation,
tell us your demand
Don't let me down, I want
a picture, a name,
something concrete and I want it
quickly, you have my fax number?
Yes
- Call me back
- Alright
The Spanish are authorizing
us to take position in Majorca
An identical airbus A300 will
be waiting for us in Rozyre
Get everyone on board
and get over there
Roland, bring the late comers with you,
meet in in Majorca with a trans off
Commander
Algerian national
- We have to get it off the ground
- Yes, we all agree on that
very well
The hijackers are puppets, the master
mind of the operation is Ali Touchent
better known to our people as Tariq
Operation Cresateno
He's one of the big fish
at FIS that we're after
He's the only one that got away
We were told he was hiding
out in a safe in Sonacotra
But when we search it,
he already vanished
This guy a commander, he rumoured
to be a double or triple agent
- Agent for whom?
- Algeria, Russia and probably us
- What exactly do you have in mind?
- Buying peace
The GIA had three years of civil war
The organization has no money left
We should avoid a confrontation,
we have to talk to their wallets
Do you realize, if we fail,
we'll be financing terrorism?
Are you going to remove
the boarding step?
Will you remove them or not?
You have to ask them, go on
Algiers runway, this
is Air France 8969
Could you please remove
the boarding step?
Algiers runway, this
is Air France 8969,
this is the captain
speaking, do you copy?
Makrouf
Get the Vietnamese man
Lets go
Move, lets go
Look at you, aren't you ashamed, huh?
Lets go, move it, move it
This miscreant is near ALLAH
Carol, come to the crisis unit
We want you to explain your idea
Its all goes back with
this man Ali Touchent
38 years old from
Algeria upper class
He studied history at Sorbonne
and then work at the GIA
His biggest enemy Algiers, not Paris.
That much is certain
-So?
-That mean that we will talk to us
We can negotiate with him,
the security general gave me a contact
He knows where Touchent is
We just have to give
him some incentive
How much will it cost?
Miss, all of my brothers are married
Yahya has a son, Mustafa has 3 sons
even Salim
I'm the only single one
thats not good
You're not wearing a ring
Makrouf
I'm listening
My name is  Carol Jeanton, I work at
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
I'm speaking on it's behalf
Can I ask with whom I'm speaking?
Are you Ali Touchent?
I'll pass on the information
you gave me to him
very well my superiors
wish to negotiate to him
I just need a direct line with him
I'll call this number in an hour
Prepare to take the highway 
84 to a Marne-la-Vallee
Ali Touchent is in France?
Jocque you go with her and take over
Carol you observe
If this thing go wrong its on you
[Praying]

Palma de Majorque Airport
Hurry tidy yourself up a little
Wait there for mummy, hang on
Is that daddy?
Daddy
Wait here in the car,
you don't have any business here
I can't guarantee your safety
What did we do?
Do what they said, do not
exceed 30 miles per hour
What?
at the next junction, follow sign
to the industrial areas
Don't move I said
Don't move, who's talking?
Who's talking? Answer!
I am
Come on, move it
You can take it off
If you wanted to see me,
it means you have an offer
I'm listening
700,000 francs, it yours
For your Organization
or for you personally
Once you decided to
take this money,
we have no control
over its destination
- You want what from me?
- Tell them to stop everything at once
Is that all?
I must be too idealistic
I believe that you would
promise to force my
government to free my
incarcerated brothers
but instead, you come
to me with small change
I could slit your throat for that
You don't know who
you're dealing with.
You dealing with people
who are determined
and who will never retreat
Even if this war would last a
1000 years, we will fight,
our son will take our place
and their son after them
We will hit you where
we like and when we like
I don't accept it, but I'll keep it
- We part ways here
- Why are you in Paris sir?
You don't ever quit do you?
The Plane will be in Paris soon
They will be a press conference
- We have things to say
- But you don't honor the Koran sir
You're saying our battle is a lie?
The god are watching you
They're writting down
your every action
They know what you do
The righteous shall has
his reward with god
but the corrupt shall receive
God wrath with their sins
They shall burn in hell
on the day of retribution

to check or a woman
[Saying Prayer]
Allahuakbar
Allahuakbar
Allahuakbar
- Its a suicide mission
- Meaning what?
This hijacking is unlike
anything we seen
I believe their aim is to
crush the plane in Paris
Can you prove the
claim you're making?
Touchent is in Paris but he
never intended to negotiate
He only wanted a front row seat
I think that they,
that they are targeting
a symbolic place or building
We cannot act on you intuition alone
All I know for certain
in this whole
affair is that spend
the special funds,
- Lets resume
- Alright
Can the French guy
drive the step?
I can bring him over
here and we can ask him
Should I do that? Hang on
- Can you drive?
- Yes
Open the door
- What your name?
- Yannick Beunier
Alright Yannick you should not
be scared,
you would go down, and
take the boarding step away
- I do not know if I..
- You'll be free afterward. Go!
Release the hostages, we can talk
I repeat, release the
hostages, we can talk,
release the hostages,
we can talk
What's wrong?
There are jacked-set into the
ground. I can't take them out
We need your cooperation
Tell us your demand
- My brother
- What is it?
Maybe I can help you
Come here
- Peace be upon you
- and upon you
I know how to remove the steps
I done it before, I
work at this airport

You work where?
Customs

Shoot him! Shoot!
Run! Run!
Give me the gun. Give the gun
Mustafa
Enemy of ALLAH
We are ALLAH soldiers
Allahuakbar
You're all traitors
greedy for money
That's all you want.
ALLAH enemies
Money, that's all you
were interested in
Please stop!
You get up
What's going on Yahya huh?
What's going on?
No body moves
Stay where you are
No body moves
No body moves
Go on talk

My name is Yannick Beunier
I work at the French Embassy

If you don’t do anything,
they will execute us
You have to do something
I swear to you I will put a bullet
his head and throw him to you
Don't you see we're are
not afraid of you?
You're dealing with the men
with men who has great faith.
Men who will never retreat
if this battle goes on for one year,
and we will fight for one year
We are not afraid because
we are ALLAH soldiers
ALLAH entrusts us
with this holy mission
We will hit whatever we want to hit,
whenever we want, is that clear?
So big guy, do you have 
anything to say to me?
Yahya
Go ahead
You can stop everything
Its not too late to stop Yahya
Please my boy
I love you mother
but I love ALLAH more than you
We will each other again in paradise
Have you thought about your boy?
and what about me?
you can't leave me like this, don't do this
Please don't do this
Yahya, Yahya
Yahya please listen to me, I have a
massage from the Algerian government.
Your life will be spared if
you release the hostages
Do you I'm a fool or what?
You have until 9.30 pm to get
this plane in the air.
Do you understand?
Then I'll have a surprise install
for you. We will blow up this plane
and everyone in it and there
is nothing you can do about it
I am running out of patient
Open the door
Please, Don't do it
This miscreant is near ALLAH
Madam please get
back into the car right now
Sit down
We are ALLAH soldiers
Allahuakbar
We are ALLAH soldiers
Don't treat me like a fool,
listen closely
A French national is just executed
If the plane doesn’t take of,
we'll contact the UN security Council
Is that clear?
Go tell your president that
Earlier this afternoon, Prime Minister
Édouard Balladur returned to Paris,
he went to a Hotel where
he met with his ministers
France authority said, they
will protect the passengers first
The government plan of action
has been clearly defined
to do everything to ensure
the safety of the hostages
especially the French hostages
and The Air France personnel
The islamic commando deliver a
new ultimatum this evening
If by 9.30 pm the plane
has not taken off
A frenchmen would be killed, the
ultimatum expires and 8 minutes later
The commando carry
out his threat.
The Frenchmen,
Yannick Beunier from
the French Embassy in
Algiers was then killed
As the result French and Algerian
authorities gave their go ahead
and at 2 o'clock in the morning
Air Traffic controller tower
calling Air France 8969, over
- Air France 8969 I'm listening,
- You have authorization for take off
If we storm the plane,
I'll go in first
We're not there yet.
First, we have to negotiate
as much as possible
You're doing your job,
your doing political reasoning
but those guys are warriors
Warriors don't engage in politics,
and when they do they don't negotiate
They want two mujaheddin
to be set free
Yeah
A hijacking for two known names
Why Paris?
This operation will
be unfavorable
We didn't choose the
field or the weapons,
There will be losses
There will be losses
and yet you still
want to go in first,
What does that mean?
I'm listening
So, you know the situation, in
order to have electricity on board,
we used the backup engine.
10 tonne of Kerosene remain
- not enough to get to Paris
- What does that mean?
Either we wait of Algiers
to fuel the plane or we
take off now go to Marseille,
refuel and go to Paris
We'll go to Marseille
I'll tell them
at 1:45 am at Algiers airport
Three Mechanics
went to the plane,
they remove the obstacles from the
runway and take the step away
At 1.55 the plane began to shake
5 minutes later, it took off
The captain was in a hurry to leave
He told air traffic
control at Algiers that...
It's just the first victory 
I spoke to the Prime Minister
I mentioned the
possibility of a suicide
mission and he's
extremely concern
The interior minister has taken
over but he wants you on the case
Very well
Everyone two Mirage 2000
will escort the plane.
If it doesn't land in Marseille,
it will be shot down
Arrival in the zone in 30 minutes
Marseille, Marignane Airport
- Hello
- Hello
It will be here in an hour.
We're going to need the full
cooperation of all your personnel so
We can set up our operation
We rerouted all the air
traffic to other airport
Which landing strip is the
farther-est from control tower?
Number 3, I think number 3
That's where it will land
We set up our PC ops
in the nearest hangar
No problem, we organized all of that
Did you prepare all the
material we requested?
We did, everything’s in the hangar.
I'll take you there
Thanks
Ready?
Next step, set up the
negotiation with the chief.
- Yes
- Good
I'll get on your frequency
Everyone, this is Dennis.
Deployment of armed
back up on the runway
The plane is approaching,
it just appeared
over the mountain
It has begun landing
end of mission order
Everyone, the airbus is
approaching
I'm coming
Welcome to France,
we're happy to have you here
I do not want to talk to you.
We are going to Paris and you
will us fuel. You have until 9.00 pm
9.00 pm, not 1 minute longer
I will do everything in my power,
how much Kerosene do you need?
- 29 tonnes huh?
- They only need 9 to get to Paris
They're making a flying bomb.
More Kerosene mean more fire.
They want to crash into Paris
They want to be a symbol
They only introduce Mr Solignac,
- and you are?
- Carole Jeanton from foreign affairs
I work for that Mr. Solignac
The Prime Minister sent
us here tonight to
relay this information and make
sure its taken into account
Then, that airplane
will not leave Marseille
Didier to Dennis for the IDs
Two terrorist in the cockpit
Boss is the one in
contact with tower
Warrior is the one
carrying Kalashnikov AK-47
Two terrorists in the back,
Curly is the one in the passenger isle
and little is the one that looks young
Do all the shooter copy the IDs?
Christian, Ok
- Didier, Ok
- Geck, Ok
Neil, Ok
Paris, Monday December 26 1994
Hello
You want me to hold? Okay
Yes I can give it to you now,
30 passengers deaths 10 GIGN deaths
Ok, Bye
What was that?
An estimate of deaths in
an event of a assault
from Marrianne
We got a problem, the fuel workers
refuse to go near the plane
They're discussing it,
its understandable
I don't care, if 9.05. Make a
good gesture, free a hostage
The only reason I'm
here is to get fuel
I told you, 9.00 pm it is 9.05, you
want to know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to need more time,
I cannot give you what I
don't have, I'm sorry
- How much time?
- I don't know
an hour?
Fine, I want a press conference
- Dennis?
- Yes
Ahh Shit
Mummy
Where are we going?
Come on honey, lets get out of here
Yes?
Hold the line, The interior
Yes? Yes sir
No, no I don't agree
We're in negotiation,
we still have argument left sir
An assault would be premature sir
We all due respect, the GIGN will
intervene when we decide its time
Major Favier? Yes, this
is Carole Jeanton,
We met at the ministry
before you left
Right
I understand you doubt
about storming the plane
but I would like to suggest that
we establish a plan of conduct
You will intervene
in two cases, if the
hijacker is in danger passenger
lives or if they try to take off
Fine by me
never do that again
The airplane is still
the Marseille airport
where it was forced to land
because their fuel reserve has run low
The hijackers make
a new ultimatum,
demanding a refueling
and a press conference
French police have
taken position around
the aircraft and
they are currently
- Well chief?
- Clear out the first row Yahya
Make room for the
journalist and cameras
We're ready, they can come
Yahya you know that the French
government is waiting for a gesture
and its time to free hostages
I will let 2 hostages go,
that is our final gesture
When they are on the ground,
you have 20 minutes to bring the fuel
Otherwise we will kill everyone
It is 3.30 pm, 2 passengers,
a man and a woman are seen
leaving the plane
She seem weak.
They are the first
hostages to be freed since
the plane landed in France
Thank you
- That is valuable information for us
- My daughter, Laila
She's in the plane
Please, get her out
Please,
I made a gesture, now its your turn to
show us if you're a man of your word
I am doing my best. The fuel worker
still refuses to go out there
Leave the fuel truck 600
feet away from here
and then tell the driver to
leave the keys and go away
- What do you say Chief?
- I will see if that possible
Of course its possible, I said so
and I want a press conference
There's a problem Yahya,
the truck are very big
You need a special permit to
drive them, its dangerous
You're lying, you are
making all of this up
You don't want to give us fuel,
you're liars and you are
conspiring against us
Dennis, Yahya is very hostile
I think we should move in
Come on
Hey that's my toy not yours,
its mine. Give it back to me
No
Its ok, don't cry
Their last ultimatum is almost expired
They might take action now
They're heavily armed. We'll be
fighting in a very small space
These guys are not
average maniacs
There's to be absolutely no doubt,
no question in your mind when
you go in that airplane
If a colleague is hurt, if a
colleague hits the ground
even if he is your partner,
you keep going
Go
Everybody in position
The plane's moving
Lock the runway with the tank
Start the movement
Roget that sir
Give me the bolt cutters
Tank in position,
runway lock
In position support fire?
Support fire is in approach
The airplane has just stopped
Go to your gunner
Oh God, give your blessing to our
dead, our presence and our absence,
our young and our old and
our male and our female
Thats the death prayer
You have to act now
Dennis, what are you dong?
The shooters are taking positions
And action!
Shit, its starting
Didier, confirmation?
The two hijackers in the
back is going to the front
Now!
Allahu Akbar
GIGN, nobody move

Come on lets go, move
Look at me a Thierry, look at me
Follow the light
Get the vehicle folks
Come on
We need you in the field, get up
Get up please
Lets go. Move it
They were call on
to speak to the hijackers
under the authority of
interior minister, Charles Pasqua
and it became obvious to us all
that the only way for us 
to save human lives
was to storm the airplane
That is, the decision I made
I would like to emphasize the fact
