HAYATHNAGAR, HYDERABAD
Shankaranna, how are you?
Yeah, I am good.
He is a good-natured boy,
earns a five figured salary.
This is a very good alliance for us.
Your wish is my command, father.
"Oh woman... Oh woman...
Does the world know your value?"
"Oh woman... Oh woman...
Is there a limit for your endurance?"
"You are ubiquitous...
You are all over the world"
"You are always on the run,
in the house and outside"
"And yet, you'd never say
you're tired even a bit"
"You'll fill all your path with light"
"Oh woman... Oh woman...
Does the world know your value?"
"Oh woman... Oh woman...
Is there a limit for your endurance?"

-Here is your rent amount, uncle.
-Thank you.
-Oh no, count the money.
-Hey...
I know the count would be correct.
"Unless you open your kohl-rimmed eyes,"
"there won't be a dawn on the earth"
"Unless your bangle-clad hands move"
"there won't be any
further existence of anything"
"You are in every relationship like
an attachment, weaved with love"
"Your endless struggle
is beyond quantification"
"Oh, embodiment of primordial energy
who doesn't seek for temples,"
"there won't be any light
in a world without you"
"Under your love and affection,"
"every man is, in fact, an infant"
"The genesis of every sparkling
smile that adores countless lips"
"is you!"
"Oh woman... Oh woman...
Does the world know your value?"
"Oh woman... Oh woman...
Is there a limit for your endurance?"
[cicadas crittering]
[horns blaring]
[laughing]
[engine sputters]
[thunder rumbles]
What happened, brother?
I'm asking you... what happened?
Vehicle breakdown.
Why would there be breakdown now?
[dialling]
Buddy, I am on the service
road beside the ring road.
There are three girls in my
car. But the car had a breakdown.
Come here.
Come fast.
Pallavi...
I feel suspicious about him.
He seems to be hinting someone about us.
Check for cabs.
There are no cabs.
That's true.
[phone vibrates]
[dialer tone] The number you
 are calling is not answering...
Tsk!
[car honks]
Hey...
-Hey... Stop... Stop...
-Stop...
Stop... Please stop...
No one stops their vehicle in this route.
[thunder rumbles]
I am getting scared now.
There are no cabs around.
No one's giving us a lift either.
What do we do?
-Stop!
-Lift... Stop...
-Lift please...
-Lift please...
-Stop...
-Please...
[tyres screech]
Vishwa?
He was your schoolmate, wasn't he?
Yes.
-Hey, Pallavi!
-Hi, Vishwa.
How come you are here?
We were returning after
attending an office party.
And suddenly, our cab had a breakdown.
Well, I am not headed to the city.
I am going to dinner with my friends.
Actually, Vishwa...
 we can't find any cabs around here.
If you don't mind,
please take us away from here.
Please.
-Alright, come with us.
-Thanks, Vishwa.
Zareena, come on.
Hey, who are they?
They must be his friends.
Get in.
AFTER A WHILE
Start the vehicle.
[tyres screech]
Oh damn!
-Go now.
-Okay.
[groans in pain]
Vishwa, don't spare these girls at all.
How come they did this?
[car honks]
Move aside.
Doctor.
[coughs]
[machine beeping]
We shouldn't have gone with them.
Maybe this wouldn't have happened.
It seems his head got severely injured.
What if something happens to him?
[machine beeping]
Sir...
His eye?
There were pieces of glass
in it. We removed them.
By the way,
do you want to file an MLC report?
MLC report?
Legal procedures... police?
-No... No, sir.
Just take care of the patient first.
We will take care of all such things.
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. Sure, sir.
It's a contract worth 130 crores, sir.
Sir, if you put in a word,
it will be done.
When we are not in power...
we must make sure our acts look like
they are for the welfare of people.
And after we get back into the power,
we must be selfish.
Since we are in power,
consider it as done.
Thank you, sir. I shall take leave.
-Sudhakar...
-Sir.
give my son a call once.
Okay sir.
[phone ringing]
Hello.
Greetings, uncle.
This is Shiva speaking.
When did it happen?
Well Uncle...
It happened last night, uncle.
Were there any stitches?
Yes... yes, uncle.
He had to be stitched up.
How many?
Well, it must be around 7 or 8, uncle.
I hope his eye is alright.
His eye is fine, uncle.
But we would know about it only
after the bandage is removed.
Where did this happen and who did it?
Well... It happened
near by Moinabad, uncle.
I hope there's no problem.
No. There's no problem, uncle.
Please don't stress.
 I will take care of it.
Okay. Later, make him speak to me.
Yes, uncle. I'll do that.
[indistinct dog barking]
[honks] [bike revvs]
Hey.. Hey...
[groans]
Hey... Hey... Get lost!
Uncle... Uncle...
Get up.
I hope there aren't any bruises.
Hey, give him some water.
Uncle, are you okay?
Kids have turned out to
be very rash these days.
Here, have some water.
Your limbs are fine, right?
Are your limbs fine?
Drink. Drink some water.
Call for an auto-rickshaw.
He needs to be dropped close by.
You live in Srinagar Colony, right?
I'll get your bike
delivered at your home.
Go home safely, uncle.
Go home and do me a small favor.
There are three girls, who are
living in your Laxmi Vihar apartment.
Make them vacate immediately.
They are not good girls.
They are very shady...
Shady when it comes to
money and the way they charge.
They got into a fight with one of
my friends and almost killed him.
If someone like them rents out your place,
your reputation will be ruined.
Make sure you get them to
vacate as soon as possible.
Okay?
Today, you were just hit by a
vehicle and luckily, you got escaped.
Tomorrow, if you are hit by a truck,
your helmet will not
be able to protect you.
You might straight away... die.
Auto-rickshaw, get moving!
Uncle...
I hope nothing bad happened to you.
No, dear.
I am fine.
But, they even called the
colony president to put...
some pressure on you to vacate this flat.
May be the colony residents might object.
This is my apartment, dear.
It's my wish.
Who the hell do they think
they are to give me orders?
There is no need for you to go anywhere.
But, I think it would be better if you
take some sort of an action against them.
I mean... like any police complaint.
No, uncle.
We don't want to make
it into a bigger deal.
Alright, dear.
Your wish.
I'll take leave.
Be careful, dear.
They don't seem to be good people.
Hey! Hello?
What happened?
Sorry.
Damn!
-Anwar?
-Why did you interfere in those issues?
What is it with you?
How long has it been since
you were given notices?
Why don't you vacate?
How can we vacate the place?
You said you'd give us an
alternative place to stay.
Did you, then?
We'll vacate only when you do.
Otherwise, we won't. Do whatever you want.
[overlap of voices]
Vacate the place.
Hey, throw them away.
Can't you understand?
Oh no!
[cursing]
[kid crying]
[chaos]
Open it! Hurry!
They are opening it. Hold on!
Just hurry!
Why are you creating a ruckus?
Is it going to cost your
life if it gets late?
If you don't hurry, a lot of people
there are going to die soon!
So, open fast.
Okay. Guys, open it.
When everyone is vacating,
why are you settling in?
Do you need to be told specifically?
Get out!
[glass shatters]
Brother! Why are you hitting us?
This is non-notified slum.
The government gave orders
that this place must be vacated.
The Municipal office gave
notices for the same.
What do you want us to do?
Sir, they said they would
get us alternative housing.
But they didn't do that.
How can we vacate when they didn't
provide us alternative housing?
Please, tell us.
You promised to get them
alternative housing. So, do that.
If you indulge into hooliganism
instead, this would be the cases.
Sir!
Uncle, he's been like an
erupting volcano till now.
But he has cooled down
with a gulp of booze.
What is this?
He would be in control
only when he is intoxicated.
As soon as he gets sober,
he would react to every small thing.
Generally, anyone who gets
intoxicated loses control.
How can he control his
senses when he is drunk?
That is his nature.
Everything he does is unique.
Why do you still keep punishing yourself?
It's because I cannot blame
anyone, so I am punishing myself.
Come. Come with me.
You are not supposed to be here.
We cannot, anyway, stay here.
But we must stay somewhere or another.
Let's go, sir.
Whether Lord Rama lives in
Ayodhya or a forest, he'd live happily.
It's his disciples who are pained
when they see where he has to live.
We are unable to watch you in this state,
sir.
I won't listen to your excuses.
Unless you come with me today,
I will not move from here.
What did the doctor say?
What would he say?
Can't you see? Huh?
Once I find Pallavi...
I will...
Of course, where can she go?
-Wait and watch what I'll do to her.
-Why are you instigating him?
Vishwa, just shut up!
Why? Are you scared?
Why did you become such a coward?
Bunty,
Bunty, pull over.
I will talk to her right now.
Hey... Hey...
What are you going to talk to her about?
Hello
Pallavi?
Who is this?
Why do you care who it is?
Who do you want to talk to?
You.
The thing is that, you have hit my friend.
Now, it looks like he might lose his eye.
How do you want me to retaliate for this?
Listen,
I am really sorry.
It wasn't intentional.
It just ended up that
way in that situation.
Shut up!
Did anyone abduct you?
You came with us by choice.
Of course.
But when he did that, I got angry.
You were angry then.
And now, my friend is getting angry.
And I am getting enraged looking at him.
You are going to have
a tough time ahead.
Are you threatening me?
If you are brave,
come and stand in front of me.
If I come in front of you,
you are going to beg,
"Please leave. Leave."
That is how you are going to beg me.
Hey! Don't be a coward and keep
threatening me over the phone.
If you have the guts,
come and see me in person.
What the hell are you going to do?
Hello
The girl is very feisty, buddy.
Getting her to submit to
us will be a lot of fun.
Since the incident happened in Moinabad,
so register your complaint there.
But, sir... They are threatening us here.
So, you made up your minds to file
a complaint against them, huh?
Yes, sir.
Madam, do you know how it would
seem when you go to a police station
and lodge a complaint?
It looks like you are courting
trouble when it would simply blow away.
It would be a fine mess getting rid of it.
At least, you could give
those boys a warning.
Warning them isn't such
a big deal. Let's do it.
But, you guys physically
assaulted the guy.
So, if he comes and files
a complaint against you,
an FIR would be filed
against you in reverse.
Moreover, you are at a marriable age.
Tomorrow, if there is a prospective
groom seeking your hand,
they would enquire about you, right?
If you register a case and
this leaks out during enquiry,
your parents' reputation would be ruined.
Well...
it is God's grace that nothing
untoward happened to you on that night.
You know how things are
these days, don't you?
I am telling you this
as a police officer...
At times, even the dead
bodies are being found.
If girls resist,
they are being stabbed with knives.
Or, they are subjected
to acid attacks as well.
You have such a beautiful face, madam.
Sir,
what are you saying now?
Should I file a report
at the police station...
...which is located in the area
where the incident took place in?
You wouldn't file my complaint here?
Of course, we will!
Isn't that why the government
introduced 'Zero FIR'?
No matter where the
incident took place in the state,
you can go to any station
and file your complaint.
-The report writer is over there.-Sir...
Go ahead and file your complaint.
-Get lost!-Sir...
How could you head directly...
...to the police station to register
a complaint without consulting us?
Do you know what the police would do?
Do you think we can trust them?
So, what are you saying?
Are you asking me to
withdraw the police complaint?
Or else, are you asking me to apologize
to them and beg for their forgiveness?
Pallavi,
don't you know why we left our homes
and are staying far away from them?
If we don't send monthly
expenses to our parents,
my mom wouldn't be able
to get her treatment.
And the construction of her
house would get stalled.
Your father will not be
able to repay his debt.
We are here to work and stay peacefully,
but not to keep wandering
about the police stations.
I am not apologetic.
Please, Pallavi!
Don't complicate this any further.
Tomorrow, we are going to call
them and apologize to him.
That's all.
They are weeping and
confessing that it was all their mistake.
They are even ready to call and apologize.
That's all well and good.
But what I've planned for
her would be even better.
Hey, you were not even there on
that day, in the first place.
What exactly is your problem?
If I was there,
things wouldn't have gotten out of hand.
Anyways, when it comes to girls,
we should make them know their place.
If not, they'd take things
for granted and harass us.
Once in a while,
we need to react in such a way
and remind them about their position.
Let's set that aside.
Are you ready to compromise?
Because, they are ready
to call and apologize.
You just don't listen!
[phone ringing]
It's Zareena.
Should I answer her call or not?
Hello, Vishwa.
Hi, Zareena.
Vamshi is right beside me.
I'll pass the phone to him.
Talk to him.
Talk.
Zareena,
listen to me.
I have no grudge to hold against you.
Where is Pallavi?
Vamsi, that incident took
place in the heat of the moment.
-If we talk...-Zareena...
I've told you that I have no
problem with you, haven't I?
Just don't interfere.
Give her the phone.
Vamsi, listen to me.
I am apologizing to you.
Zareena!
Where is that **** Pallavi?
I need to hear her apology. Period.
Do you understand?
Please, Vamsi.
Please, don't speak that way.
Hey! How dare you try to lecture
me like some righteous woman?
Give her the phone!
Get that bloody **** on the line!
I need to talk to that ****!
Get that **** on the line.
Do I need to repeat myself?
I don't have any problem with you!
But I have a problem with you!
I have a problem with you, your language
and the crappy thoughts in your brain.
Huh!
Are you even a human?
You are talking so vulgarly!
What do you think of yourself?
You thought that I called you
because I was scared of you?
Pallavi just damaged one eye.
If it was me in her shoes,
I would have damaged both the eyes!
Wait and watch what's going to
happen to you and your bloody life!
You are going to rot in jail!
Huh!
Hey!
She is here... She is here.
-Bro, is it her number?
-Yes, Bro.
She is looking at us.
Madam, the boss wants to speak to you.
Sir...
Zareena, have a seat.
This is embarrassing.
Sir?
Zareena,
we are a big BPO company
and our reputation matters a lot to us.
Sir, someone is intentionally framing me.
I understand, but...
Sir, I know nothing about this.
-Zareena.
-Sir
Do something...
Take a few days off...
And after that...
try to look for a job in another company.
There is no future for you here.
Sorry.
Okay.
Please ask them to clear
the dues on my account.
Yeah.
[phone ringing]
Hello.
Hello, what's your price?
-Will you join us for an entire night?
 -Do you provide massages services as well?
There are two more guys along with me.
You are looking so hot, baby.
You are going to everyone.
 But what's your problem with me?
Will you come outdoor?
 I'll pay extra. Just come.
Is is all at once or one by one?
Can you give me a massage, baby?
[autorickshaw honks]
[gasps]
Don't get lost in your own
thoughts and walk, woman.
Walk carefully.
Hey Teju, wait up...
Bro, wait up.
Sister, come on.
Hey!
The girl is really strong.
Hold her legs tightly.
Don't leave her.
[muffled voice]
You shouldn't have gone
to the police, baby.
You made a big mistake by going to them.
You want to shout?
Go ahead and shout!
Let's see who comes to rescue you.
-Help!
-Shout!
-Shout!
-Help!
Help! Help!
Why are you shouting so much?
You told me over the phone to
meet you in person if I had the guts.
I am here.
Bunty, I am going to forget
everything that happened.
-Please... Please let go of me.
-[clicking tongue]
But I won't forget. Huh?
I will make sure you remember
it for the rest of your life!
Sorry... Sorry... Sorry...
Please, let go of me.
Bunty, you take care of...
I will take care of...
Okay?
[muffled voice] No... No...
[muffled voice]
What's with your tender
way around? Make it rough.
She must remember this all her life that
we abducted her just
to take revenge on her.
[muffled voice]
Sweet memories!
Remember it for the rest of your life.
Don't tell anyone. Mwah!
Get lost.
[tyres screech]
Hey! Are you drunk?
Why are you standing in
the middle of the road?
Hey... Mow him down.
Mow him down I say.
Hey! Bugger off from here!
Do you think your father owns this place?
Hey...
Do you think your father owns this place?
This isn't your father's
place either, douchebag!
[ringing in the ears]
Huh! Why the hell are you going overboard?
[groans in pain]
If you think you can step on the
accelerator and break the rules,
your bones too would break.
Hey...
Can't you see this is
a residential colony?
Can't you see children moving around?
Get the hell out of here.
What are you looking at? Get out!
Move...
[engine starts]
Come on, move it.
Why did you create such a huge
mess in such a short time, sir?
Would it be peaceful instead
of a mess if you make late?
Take this.
Pallavi! Pallavi!
Sister!
Pallavi!
Zareena sister, come fast!
What happened?
Pallavi... Pallavi...
Pallavi, what happened?
Pallavi...
Get the towel!
Pallavi...
Pallavi...
Pallavi...
Pallavi...
Pallavi!
Pallavi!
-Get the towel!-I am getting i t!
Pallavi...
Pallavi...
What happened?
Pallavi, come out.
Pallavi...
Pallavi...
Pallavi, what happened?
Can you hear me?
Pallavi...
Pallavi...
Pallavi...
Pallavi...
Pallavi, can you hear me?
Pallavi...
What happened?
Pallavi...
They wouldn't let us live here.
We have no choice but to
leave this house and city.
-Hello-Sir...
Sir, very good morning, sir.
This is CI Yugandhar here.
Tell me, Yugandhar.
Sir, fifteen days ago,
a girl came here and
filed a complaint against some very
prominent people who are close to us.
Who are they?
MP Rajendra's son, sir.
I neither registered any
FIR nor took any action, sir.
But they have again targetted
her by abducting and threatening.
The girl came to us and is pressurizing
us to take action against them.
I am unable to understand what to do.
Please advise me, sir.
-Yugandhar...
-Yes, sir.
Don't take any action now.
I will speak with the MP and then tell
you what needs to be done.
You've grown big like an animal but
your brain did not grow at all!
Aren't you ashamed to roam around with
these these immature jerks around you?
Because of your reckless behaviour,
I had to go and apologize
to some Tom, Dick and Harry!
If this goes on, how will you be able
to contest in the coming elections?
Who... Who is it?
We are here from Moinabad Police station.
Who is Pallavi here?
I am Pallavi.
-Come, let's go downstairs.
-Why?
Why?
The Sub Inspector madam
wants to speak to you.
Why can't we sit down here and talk?
Hey... What can I talk?
Come downstairs, the
inspector would speak to you.
Aren't you unable to
understand my words? Move...
I am coming, madam.
Let go of my hand!
Enough! Let's go!
Why are you shoving me?
Madam... Madam...
Let go upstairs and talk.
Do you think I came to attend some ritual
in your home, to go upstairs and talk?
Come, let's go!
Madam, what's the problem?
There is an arrest
warrant issued on your name.
You have been booked under 307 section,
attempt to murder.
We've been searching for
you for almost a week.
-Come, let's go.
-Ma'am! Ma'am!
I was the one who filed a complaint!
Why would you arrest me?
Whatever you want to tell,
do it at the police station, not here.
Let's go!
-Madam, stop!
-Please stop.
Madam, we are the ones
who filed the complaint.
There is some confusion, madam.
[siren wailing]
Madam! Please listen
to what I have to say.
-Madam!
-Start the vehicle.
-Madam! Madam!
-Zareena!
Pallavi... Pallavi...
-Pallavi!
-Don't worry.
We will follow you to the station.
-Don't worry! Don't worry!
-Zareena
This is what happens when
you let the girls stay alone.
That's true.
Look at the situation they got into.
Sir, we have been waiting since morning.
Madam isn't here yet.
Yes, she isn't here.
What do you want me to do?
If she was here, you would see her, right?
First, you all get out of
here and sit there! Go!
I thought my daughter was lucky
because we found a good wedding match.
We thought she might be engaged soon too.
If the groom's family gets wind of this...
-Sir...
-Sir...
You are still here?
Why are you wasting your time here?
-Just leave! Go!
-Sir...
Please let us meet Pallavi
once, sir. Please, sir.
That's not possible.
Don't keep pestering us.
If the Inspector madam comes,
she will rant at us.
First, get out of the station.
No one is allowed into
the station after 6 pm.
Go! Go away! Get out of the station!
They keep annoying me.
[stove sizzling]
Uncle, you please leave.
It is already late.
We will take care of it.
How can I leave in this situation?
[siren wailing]
-Sister...
-Uncle, seems like the inspector is here.
Come.
Madam, please allow us
to meet Pallavi. Please.
-Kavitha...
-Madam.
-Take them to Pallavi.
-Come with me.
Thank you, madam. Thank you.
Why did you come here, father?
Please, go home.
Father, please.
Just go home.
What are they saying?
They are asking us to go
to the court and get bail.
There is an attempt to murder
case registered against your daughter.
She smashed a bottle on a guy's head.
What if he died? Huh?
Do you even know what
your daughter is up to?
She says that she is working as a software
engineer but she is into [voice muted]
Madam!
-How can you talk like that, madam?
-Hey!
Shut up!
I'll rip your skin if you blabber!
She too is just like your daughter.
Her name too is in the case.
Here is the FIR.
Leave now!
[scoffs] Police complaint?
Give me that paper.
Pallavi was arrested
and placed in the station.
Zareena...
Zareena and Divya.
Now that you know us, give me the paper.
They have really planned well.
They picked her up on Friday.
So that she wouldn't
get a bail immediately.
Is it because you are intoxicated
that you don't understand?
That is a non-bailable warrant.
There is no way she would get a bail.
Why wouldn't she? She would definitely
get the bail if you apply for it.
If you take a very good
lawyer to the judge's house,
he would issue an emergency bail.
Do you even know the law?
Section 324: Causing grievous injuries.
Section 307: Attempt to murder.
section 383: extortion and
of course, prostitution.
These are all non-bailable offences.
But you can apply for an
emergency bail plea that is...
under the court of
criminal procedure section 437
Well, that means...
In the case of children and women,
they can be granted emergency bail even
in the cases of non-bailable offences.
Ranganna... you got me worried.
He gets drunk and puffs up
like he is some big shot lawyer.
Let's go.
His words indeed make some sense.
And his deeds would be beneficial to all.
Who? His words?
Yes.
Do you know who he is?
Who is he?
Saab.
Vakeel Saab (The Advocate)
-Sister! Sister! Wake up quickly.
-Umm...
-Sister...
-What is it?
Just wake up, I'll tell you.
Look at this.
Hey, Divya...
That's not my point, sister...
Look how prominent a lawyer he is.
What he told last night might be right.
Shall we go to him and ask him
to help us get Pallavi's bail?
Never mind! He is a drunkard who
would be intoxicated all the time.
Do we really need to take his help?
We are least bothered
about what his nature, sister.
All we need is to get Pallavi out.
Let's go and ask him, sister.
Please.
Please, let's seek his
help for this time only.
Please.
Is sir at home?
We need to apply for a bail.
He is under suspension.
He cannot work on your case.
What do you mean?
It's been an year that his
suspension has been lifted.
We read about it on the internet.
The bar council has lifted the
suspension order against him.
But the suspension he placed
upon the court is still on.
[scoffs] Didn't I tell you?
They are just all name and title.
They don't care about
common people like us.
They need only sensational cases
that fetches them money and fame.
Why would anyone stand up for us?
No one would.
This is all just a
waste of time. Let's go.
What are you talking?
Who do you think you are talking about?
It is as if you are mocking
great philantropist Karna.
The path he has chosen for himself,
the way he stood up to people,
all that he endured and suffered...
all of that was for people like us.
Brother...
we must make sure that the minister
doesn't enter in the university.
The university is our home ground.
Who is going to stop us there?
To attain that position,
he used our students for protests
and to block the roads for boycotts.
Now, he just stopped
paying us any attention.
He didn't even put the
DSC notification yet.
Neither there's news about employment
opportunities nor about the scholarships.
And he isn't coming here to attend
the function even now.
He wants to lease out the university
lands to the real estate companies.
Students must always be our support.
They should never be an obstacle.
Okay?
Clear them.
[students sloganeering] The atrocities
of the police should be condemned!
Everything clear, sir.
We arrested everyone.
But...
we couldn't find one.
Who is it?
Someone named Satya... Satyadev.
It's just one person, right?
What can he do?
Minister is coming.
[students sloganeering] Go back...
Go back... Minister, go back...
[students sloganeering] Go back...
Go back... Minister, go back...
[students sloganeering] Go back. Go back.
Minister, go back. [siren wailing]
[students sloganeering] Minister,
go back. Go back... Go back...
ACP, what is happening?
I will take care of it, sir. No problem.
"The sky is the limit for his aggression"
"And he moves for the
welfare of the lives"
Sir, he is the one who's been left out
from being arrested from that batch.
And he is the reason
behind this protest as well, sir.
If we arrest him, the rest of the
students would just scatter away.
-Go and arrest him, right now!
-Hey!
This ain't one set of
hands to arrest and handcuff.
[students roaring]
Order your men to arrest him, lock
him up and thrash the pulp out of him.
Come!
-Come!
-Go, sir.
-What are you thinking? Go and arrest him.
-I am waiting for you! Come!
Arrest him, right now!
Charge!
"Oh youth, step forward without any fear"
"Your fierce honesty will become your
strength and take you forward"
[gas hissing]
[glass shatters]
Sir, the entire media is here.
If you stay here,
you will lose your reputation.
It would be wise to leave
from here immediately, sir.
Let's go, sir.
Please, sir.
[students sloganeering] Go back. Go back.
[whistles]
Go.
[siren wailing]
Let's go.
[students sloganeering] Satya... Satya...
Excuse me,
I love you.
I don't have time for all these things.
But, thank you.
[indistinct chatter]
What is it with him?
Would the problem get solved just
because he stopped the minister?
Why is it that only he has a
problem and no one else does?
It's a manufacturing defect.
I've been watching him from his
childhood. That is his nature.
He always stands up strongly for the weak.
He thinks everyone must be
facilitated with everything he has.
That is why he distributed
his hundreds of acres of land
and his huge wealth amongst the public.
How can someone like that
resort to these methods, sir?
I've already told you, haven't I?
Manufacturing defect. That is his nature.
Whatever it may be, I can't do anything.
Go to the court and get the bail.
Alright, fine.
We will deal with it over there. Let's go.
Goodness! What's wrong, son?
Looks like you are bleeding a lot.
Well, there was some
scuffle at the university.
Well, why did they arrest you?
We live in a village
that is beside this city.
My grandfather was born there.
My father too was born there.
My children too were born there.
All of our births, birth ceremonies,
social relations, celebrations
and deaths occurred there.
Now, the government gave
the orders to vacate our land.
Once upon a time, roads were built to
enable transportation to the villages.
Now, they are vacating the
entire villages just to lay the roads.
I went around asking for justification
and every time, they just lock me up here.
Well... In this country,
a beggar would get food...
and the one who works
hard would get a shelter.
But, a poor man can never find justice.
He can never find justice.
Man survives on hope.
If that hope is dead,
death seems to be a peaceful option.
Hey old man!
You keep protesting and creating a ruckus
every day about your village and land.
Your wife comes to the station
everyday, begging to let you go.
What an annoying people you are!
Come, let's go.
At least now, try to be careful.
Okay, sir.
I too got an admission to
pursue PhD in Nuclear Physics,
in Delhi University along with you.
-Here is your admission letter.
-Go away!
If you continue this path, the university
will miss out on a good scholar.
Just come with me to Delhi.
[clamour]
What happened?
You have done such a terrible thing!
You have done so much injustice to me!
Oh God!
You have left me behind and went away!
I am all alone here without you.
All the people have vacated the
village for the construction of roads.
But you didn't.
Though we met many people for
this, we never got justice.
There are so many
lawyers and leaders here.
There are officers in high positions.
But not even a single person
came for our rescue.
You have left your life instead
of letting go of the village.
Oh you!
Oh God!
You have done me wrong!
Who should I live for?
How do I live now?
Take me away, God.
Oh God!
You left me all alone here.
[sobbing]
Don't take any decision out of haste.
If I take a decision out of haste,
I can only help a few.
But if I think it through and take a
decision, I will be able to help all.

VAKEEL SAAB SUPPORTS SINGARENI WORKERS
[people sloganeering]
Long live, Vakeel Saab!
Hey, it's the court.
-Quiet! Quiet!
-[people sloganeering]
Brother, no...
-What are you doing?
-Sir...
we won the case because of you.
If you didn't stand up for us,
the management wouldn't
have increased our wages.
We are forever indebted to you.
Sir...
for the good deed that
you've done for us...
the families of all the workers
will cherish you forever in their hearts.
You are our God, sir.
We are lucky that you have
deemed this case worthy of your effort.
Please come to our colony
once and partake in our hospitality.
Sure. I'll definitely come. Take care.
Forgive me.
But, do you know me?
I know you very well.
-How?
-Well...
Excuse me.
I love you.
Sorry, I don't have time for all this.
Thank you.
Sir... come, let's go.
You've been following me all these days?
Not just days.
I've been following you for years.
What if I didn't notice you?
Well, I would have waited
until I caught your eye.
I knew for sure that someday,
all this waiting is going
to move you in my direction.
What's your strong faith?
We've been together for
the past six lifetimes.
How can we be apart in this lifetime?
"Eye-lash... Eye-lash...
couldn't you have told me..."
"Despite the great many dreams
that you've dreamt up?"
"Oh, bells of the anklet,
there's been no jingling"
"despite the many days
you kept me company"
"Your arrival is the time for sowing
seeds, your gaze is a love letter"
"You didn't just stop yourself,
and met me like a ray of the sun"
"You have become an endless
love and come this far"
"You've burdened me with
such sweet responsibilities"
"These new stories have begun..."
"These new stories have begun..."
"From now on, instead of me and you,"
"it's the beginning of 'we'."
"I wonder what happened to
the loneliness inside my heart"
He donated all his wealth to the village.
How did you think that I would give
my daughter's hand to someone like him?
Do you have any sense?
Hey!
"I wrote our names together on time"
"The sky is our umbrella,
and this earth is a flower bed."
"Let us make a wall of love that
will shield us from others' eyes"
"Let's not leave any moment
to become close to one another"
"Let's make memories that
will fill up our hearts"
"These new stories have begun..."
"These new stories have begun..."
"From now on, instead of me and you,"
"it's the beginning of 'we'."
[hicupps]
[seizure]
[siren wailing]
You brought here saying
that she had seizures.
But she is conceived.
But, if she has seizures
when she is pregnant,
it is dangerous for both
the mother and the baby.
If you take care of her well, it's as
good as taking care of your baby.
He has always been a public person.
And I came to him as I
consider him as my world.
Imagine how well he will take care of me.
Don't worry, doctor.
As long as he is beside me,
I will not have any problem.
You are so lucky, Satya.

[people lamenting]
Sir... Sir...
Hold on! Hold on!
Don't get distraught.
Tell me what exactly happened.
At school,
they were separating the rich landlords'
children from our children in the classes.
When we said that this was wrong,
our landlord has got angry with us.
Like a pack of jackals
attacking the sheep,
they attacked our colony,
burned down our houses and crops.
[chaos]
Oh God!
[overlap of voices]
Sir, they weren't even considerate
about women or children or old people...
and killed whoever they found.
Just because we raised our
voices, they slit our throats.
My son will die!
Sir... Sir...
My son will die!
-Sir, please help us in getting justice.
-Please get us justice.
Sir, you are our only hope.
You are our only hope.
[overlap of voices]
Please, you have to help us.
Please help us get justice. Please, sir.
No.. no... Get up.
[overlap of voices] I promise you. Get up.
Sir...
I am here for you.
I will be your support.
I will definitely stay by your side.
Please head home carefully.
Please protect us, sir.
Okay. Farewell.
Look here.
Your daughter is wishing you all
the best by kicking in my womb.
Listen.
All the best.
Ranganna?
Madam!
The tablets are over.
Go and get them for me.
Okay, madam.
Come fast.
I have placed the juice
over there. Please drink it.
Is he the one who raided your homes
and killed your people on that day?
You don't have to fear anyone.
You don't have to fear anyone.
Isn't he the one who
did all those on that day?
Sir, the one who has bashed
us and killed our people...
He isn't the one.
He isn't the one.
But the other you have told me
he was the one, haven't you?
Sir, the thing is that...
we are reiterating that this man
is in no way connected to us.
This man haven't done anything to us.
Your honour, this man
is scaring the witness.
Please send him out of here, and take
the evidence from them, your honour.
-It's a request, your honor.
-Hey, lawyer!
Were you championing the
cause of such cheap people?
Order! Order!
They are people with no honour.
They will do anything,
if we threaten them.
Order! Order!
Even the justice would run away from
them when it gets to smell their stink.
Hahaha...
Order! Order! Order!
What the hell are you talking?
Mr Satya Dev,
this is contempt of the court.
I am referring you to bar council.
Huh!
Sir...
She told me that she ran out of
medicine. So, I went to get them.
By the time I returned,
she had a seizure and fell down.
By the time,
I got her to the hospital...
[sobbing]
The mother and the child...
[weeping]
[glass shattters]
He used to serve justice
to everyone in the world.
But he couldn't serve justice
to his wife who was his worldsss.
He lost everything for the people.
And that very same people did not stay
true to their word and betrayed him.
As he had manhandled
landlord's men in the court,
the bar council suspended his
license to practice law for four years.
With that, he lost all
his hope and ambition.
But his rage is still intact,
which erupts upon witnessing injustice.
Alcohol became his
only way to supress that.
He couldn't blame anyone for what had
happened, so he keeps punishing himself.
It's okay if you don't
understand such person...
but don't misunderstand him.
He is a true altruist who
stood up for us unconditionally.
And it is our misfortune to
have distanced ourselves from him.
-Madam...
-Madam... Madam...
-Madam... Madam... Please, madam.
-Madam... Madam...
-Please madam.
-Madam, please let us speak to her once.
Just for one time...
Just for one time... Madam... Madam...
-Pallavi... Pallavi...
-Pallavi...
Don't worry.
We will talk to the lawyer
and get the bail by any means.
I had a fever yesterday.
The entire cell stank of urine.
I cannot take this anymore, Zareena.
I am unable to tolerate it.
I don't know what to do.
-Pallavi...
-Pallavi...
-Pallavi...
-Pallavi...
-Pallavi...
-Pallavi...
We will make sure that you'd get a bail.
-You don't worry.
-Pallavi...
What? She attacked an MP's son?
I cannot get her a bail.
-Sir... Sir...
- Sorry.
Please, sir. Help us.
Please, sir. Please, sir.
Go away, lady.
Why drag us into their mess?
Sir... Sir...
Sir...
We were told that the bail will
get a bail if we meet the judge
and apply for an emergency bail.
Who told you that?
Lawyer Satya Dev.
You mean that alcoholic lawyer
Satyadev who was suspended?
Yes, sir.
-I hope there isn't any problem.
-There is absolutely no problem, sir.
We get hundreds of similar
cases in our nation, everyday.
Everyone is busy with their own lives.
Who is going to care? Tell me.
Well, those girls have no
considerate background.
They hail from the middle class families.
No lawyer would take up this
case because you were behind it.
They won't either.
I will take care of it.
Sudhakar.
Try to deal this carefully.
If this thing gets big and
catches the eye of the media...
I will lose all all my reputation.
Nothing to worry, sir.
But that lawyer Satya Dev...
Satya Dev?
Satya Dev isn't practicing, right?
He isn't practicing the law but he
is helping the girl with some advice.
You just take care of
that lawyer Satya Dev.
I will take care of the case.
Satya Dev.
Sir,
we didn't know who you were and
talked to you in a bad manner.
Sorry, sir.
All the lawyers are scared of them and not
coming forward to help us with the bail.
We too are confused about these
court procedures and protocols.
We don't know what to do, sir.
Will Pallavi be able to come out?
We hail from the middle class families.
Well, we wanted to turn a blind
eye to it and compromise...
but our self-respect isn't
allowing that to happen.
We want to fight this and move forward.
But the society is pointing fingers at us.
We came to this faraway city to
work and support our families, sir.
We don't know anything
other than working hard, sir.
We have no other choice on the horizon
except leaving the city and moving away.
Could you please...
apply for the bail?
Apply for the bail...
Sir,
you lost a lot for the public.
But ever since the society lost you,
a lot of people are losing
their lives as well, sir.
Your silence should never become
a curse to people like us.
Even now,
if one begs, they would get food.
If one works hard,
they would shelter as well.
But whatever we do, ordinary people
like us are unable to get justice, sir.
In this country, if one
 begs, they would get food.
If one works hard,
 they would shelter as well.
But, poor people would
 never get justice, sir.
Ordinary people like us are
 unable to get justice, sir.
Your silence should never
 become a curse to people like us.
Medicine?
[sniffs]
Hey, this isn't medicine. This is alcohol.
You...
Hey...
You are making a mistake.
He would be in control
only when he is drunk.
You are denying him alcohol.
You will surely meet your end.
Oh, really?
So what if he is not intoxicated?
Is he going to kill me?
Hey... We are here to kill him, you old...
[groans in pain]
Okay, sir... I got it.
MP Korentla Rajender, sir.
[siren wailing]
Don't worry, sir.
The entire department is here.
Even if he comes here,
he cannot do anything.
[people shouting]
[heavy collision]
Hey!
Step aside.
Stop, sir. He is an MP. If you touch him,
that is going to be a law-and-order issue.
Sir, if you don't stop,
I am going to arrest you as
part of a preliminary action.
-What did you say?
-I said I was going to arrest you.
Rambhupal, did you forget about the
fake encounter case in Karimnagar?
That case is still in the courts.
It's still going on.
Please, sir. I will lose my job.
-Move...
-Please, sir.
Listen to me, sir. Stop, sir. Let's
sit and settle down the matter.
Rajender...
Why did you send your men?
To threaten you.
Did you see any fear in me?
Did you see the fear in my eyes?
No.
Then, why did you send?
I was afraid you might take up the case.
Be afraid.
You should be scared.
You know what I am capable of...
Yes, I do.
I know what you are, your story
and the atrocities you've committed.
I am taking up the case.
Do you understand?
I am taking up this case.
I am going to support those
girls who were subjected to injustice.
I will see how your people escape this.
Those girls were the
ones who made a mistake.
The court decides on who is
right and who is in the wrong.
The court isn't your turf to
threaten people and settle the case.
I pity you.
The people you stand up for,
will be the ones to betray you.
They are ordinary people.
When people like you offer
something, they'd get greedy.
They'd get scared if you threaten them.
Their lives hang like a pendulum
between these two extremes.
Even if they are by my side or not...
I am always by their side.
Always by their side.
It's been four years since
you have been to the court.
What the hell can you do now?
No matter how many years pass,
my anger will not subside,
my goals don't change either.
Once I put on my lawyer's coat, there
will be no place for petitions or bails.
NEW DELHI
-Greetings, Mr Nanda Gopal.
-Greetings.
Please come in.
I don't accept a case without
giving it a thorough study.
And so, I don't lose any case.
You know, I always want to win.
We know that, sir.
We know that if you accept a case,
it's as good as getting
a judgement in our favour.
That is why we came to you.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
But I must tell you one thing.
If you hire someone like me for a case
such as this, it's a waste of my time
and a waste of your money.
Money is not a problem, sir.
It's not just my reputation
that's at stake here,
it is also about my
son's political future.
I understand.
But this is a very small case.
You are unnecessarily getting worried.
I am not worried because of the case.
I am worried about the defense lawyer.
Who is that defense lawyer?
Advocate Satyadev.
Vakeel Saab?
[trimmer whirring]
Silence! Silence!
Stand up, everybody.
[bell dings]
Case number 79/20.
State vs Vemula Pallavi.
Prosecution may proceed.
Your honour...
We call our nation as Mother Bharat and
accord respect to women and revere them.
Even in such societies, women are being
subjected to assault and it's very sad.
But for the safety of these women...
we strengthened the existing laws and
created additional laws
such as Nirbhaya, Disha.
Unfortunately, some women
take advantage of these laws,
frame and blackmail innocent men
and try to extort money from them.
And there are some who stand by
such cases and want to win at any cost.
And this is exactly what
has happened in this case.
On May 4th...
Vemula Pallavi, along with her
friends, asked for a lift on the road.
The only reason Vamsi
agreed to give her a ride
because she was
acquainted with a friend of his.
But when they got into the car,
she said that she was hungry...
So, in an act of humanity,
he took the girls for dinner to the
resort that he was actually headed for.
There, this girl made sexual
advances and Vamsi declined.
But the girl blackmailed him for money
and threatened to file a rape case against
him. Even then, Vamsi didn't give in.
Then, she hit him very hard
on his head and tried to kill him.
And this act was totally
unprovoked and vicious, your honour.
After that, the girl along with
her friends ran away from there.
This is clearly a case of trying to
extort
by inflicting grievous
injuries, Section 324,
and attempt to murder, section 307.
And the point to be noted here,
your honour, is...
women such as these
who prey on innocent men
and abuse such laws are a
disgrace to womankind, your honour.
Such people should be
punished very severely.
That's all, your honour.
Mr Satya Dev.
Nanda...
Sir...
The lecture you have given is very
good and very pleasant to hear.
You have great command
over Telugu language.
I appreciate you for that.
Even though there is
no silver screen here,
you made sure to narrate a
fabricated story very well.
Anyway, you are
a multi-talented personality.
Your honour...
These men have used the desperate
situation that the girls were in,
misbehaved with my client
and assaulted her sexually.
The police have ignored Pallavi's
complaint due to their political influence
and issued a charge sheet based on
the case filed by Vamsi, your honour.
To hide the mistake
that they have committed,
they continued to threaten
Pallavi and her friends.
Shiva, Bunty here along with
two other guys kidnapped Pallavi
and sexually assaulted
her again in the car.
The case filed against
my client is a false one.
It is a clear-cut case of
vindictive litigation, your honour.
The actual cases they should have filed...
must have been section 354:
outraging the modesty of women,
section 506: criminal intimidation,
section 362: kidnapping,
section 340: wrongful
confinement, your honour.
Wrongful confinement!
Vakeel sab, just because you
recite the sections like a parrot,
that will not lead to a punishment.
There is a due process.
Your honour, I request the presence of,
PW1 investigation officer, Ms Sarala.
Proceed.
Madam, on what basis did
you file the charge sheet?
Sir, immediately after
the incident took place,
the boys approached me
and filed a complaint.
I hesitated because
they were girls and so...
I did not take direct action.
Instead, I conducted a
detailed investigation.
Good.
When I went to Prakruti
resort and conducted an enquiry,
I found that...
these girls were right there
at the time of the incident.
That is why, I filed the charge sheet
based on the complaint given by the boys.
Alright.
But why is it that you didn't
arrest Pallavi immediately?
Sir, this girl was absconding.
Your honour,
MO bar 1 material evidence.
The evidence of the bottle that
she used to hit the victim.
Pallavi's fingerprints are all over it.
Your honour,
the victim is deeply injured
because Pallavi has hit him hard.
If Vamsi's critical artery was cut due
to the assault, Vamsi would have died.
And this is the doctor's
report about it. MO 2.
Your honour...
PW 2...
I request to call the resort waiter
Srinivas to the witness box.
-Srinivas...
-Sir.
Is she the girl who attacked Vamsi?
Yes, sir. She is the one.
What exactly happened on that night?
Sir, that day when they arrived with
the boys, they were in good humor.
Looking at the way they dressed
and behaved, I grew suspicious.
Sir!
Sir, we were wearing very ordinary dress.
Don't speak out of your turn.
[-You will get your chance.
-But... sir...
So, based on the way
that these girls dressed,
you figured their nature.
-Yes sir.
-Objection, your honour.
Mr Nanda, that's not been proven yet.
Vakeel Saab,
I am not the one who
keeps beating around the bush.
I strike at the exact crux of
the issue and proceed from there.
Relax.
Please proceed.
After a while, we heard
loud noises and screams.
When I ran to look at what's happening,
I saw these three girls running away.
The victim was severely injured.
His entire face was covered in blood.
That's all, your honour.
Ms Vemula Pallavi,
there are some serious
allegations against you.
Do you wish to say something?
Proceed.
Sir...
everything they said was a lie.
Everyone was lying.
Please write.
The accused has pleaded not guilty.
This session of the court is adjourned.
I didn't think you would
return to practicing law.
Why? Are you scared that I returned?
All the evidences are in our favour.
So, this case doesn't stand a
chance. Let's finish this fast.
Advise the girls into admitting that
they did all this to extort money.
I will make sure that they are
let off with slight punishment.
And don't ever worry that you
wouldn't find any work ever again.
Come to me.
Then?
You want me to bow down to you,
worship you and work as your slave?
I am not a lawyer who works for money.
I am a lawyer who works for public.
Vakeel Saab, you have taken
up a case which would be lost.
You will lose.
One who is greedy will see
things as winning or losing.
Someone who is
goal-oriented focuses on the journey.
If you keep holding
these sorts of principles,
you will be left all alone.
Truth is always alone, Mr Nanda.
But everyone has to surrender
to the might of the truth.
You came here to win and
I came here for justice.
Yours is a selfish interest
and my motive is righteousness.
Let's see.
The potential groom's family got to know
about your daughter being arrested
and the details of this case.
That's why they are
letting go of this alliance.
I am sorry, sir.
Please say that I don't know anything
about your sister losing her job.
That's because if she gets to
know about it, she'll be anguished.
I think as long as I am alive,
my children are bound to suffer.
-Hello
-How are you father?
It's been so long. I want to see you.
Tomorrow, I am going to
catch a bus and come to you.
No... No, don't come. I'll come there.
What is it, child? What's troubling you?
Have something went wrong?
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened, father.
Okay? See you.
Divya Naik.
Aren't you from a tribal area
'Thanda' in Adilabad district?
Yes, sir.
Tell me, how long have
you been doing this?
Sir, I am not that kind of girl.
These people have filed
a wrong case against us.
Have you been
acquainted with Bunty before?
No, sir.
If that's the case, why did you go
into a room alone with Bunty on that day?
I went to use the toilet.
Who closed the door after
both of you went into that room?
I don't remember.
Don't remember?
I will tell you.
You did it.
Maybe, I did.
After using the toilet, were you in that
room with Bunty for a long time?
Yes, sir. But...
Don't beat around the bush.
Just answer to the point.
Were you or were you not?
Yes.
That's all, your honour.
Your honour, I would like to cross...
Dear Divya...
Divya, why did you use the bathroon in the
other room instead of the one in yours?
Sir...
Vamsi said that the flush in
that room wasn't working...
and directed us to use
the one in the other room.
That is why I went.
Why did you go with
Bunty instead of going alone?
The other room was locked.
He sent Bunty along to unlock it.
That is why Bunty came with me.
Why did you close the door?
Sir, I was in a hurry to use the washroom.
When we went inside,
Bunty started to switch on the lights.
I must have closed it
without giving it a thought.
To close the door for the safety
is the natural habit of women.
Why were you in the room
for such a long time?
First, I went to the washroom.
When I came out of the
washroom, the lights were off.
Everything was dark.
I was very scared.
Even when I called for Bunty two to
three times, there wasn't any response.
Slowly, I heard him laugh.
He caught me suddenly and
threw me onto the bed.
After that,
he used his hands...
he used both his hands...
My...
My...
There you've heard it, your honour.
Mr Nanda...
What Divya said isn't some folk tales,
they are the actual truth.
I hope you now understand why Divya went
into that room and what happened there.
But, the points you have
raised got me new thinking.
That is a girls safety manual.
Principle of women's
safety and protection.
Rule no 1:
No girl should go
anywhere alone with a boy,
be it the movies or the
restaurant or a resort.
She mustn't go to the toilet at all.
If she does, everyone imagines that the
girl is ready to get physical with a guy.
And everyone believes that the
girl has now given complete consent
to be touched and held
by the guy in any manner.
Vakeeel Saab, this is a court.
Why are you spouting morals here?
Let's not moralize issues.
Let's talk about facts.
That's all your honour. Please go on.
Your honour, I would like to call
upon Koduri Ramana, alias Bunty.
Koduri Ramana... Koduri Ramana.
Mr Ramana, did you go to another
room with Divya on that night?
Yes, sir.
What did you guys do for so long in there?
Sir, it's embarrassing to talk about
this in front of so many people.
Please try and understand.
He is lying.
You don't talk!
You go ahead.
That night, in that room,
she slowly touched me
and told me not to
worry about the charges.
She said that Pallavi is going to
talk to Vamsi and set it all up.
She began to kiss me and
undo the buttons on my shirt.
I was scared and pushed her away.
I told her that I wasn't that kind
of a person and that this is wrong.
Did you say it was wrong?
A beautiful girl is all
alone in the room with you...
What you say is incredulous.
Sir, I have a girlfriend.
And I am committed to her.
Okay.
We come from a very traditional family.
I object, your honour.
What for, sir?
I object to that over-action.
Bunty, your acting skills
are not up to the mark.
I am unable to tolerate such
award-winning performance.
Sir, whatever he said is a complete lie.
He kept flirting with Divya
all through that night.
We will know soon who was
flirting with whom, pretty soon.
Your honour, I would
like to call upon Vamsi.
Mr Vamsi, what exactly
happened on that night?
Actually that night, me and my friends
were heading to a resort.
These girls were on the
road and asked for a lift.
-We agreed.
-Objection!
We haven't started anything
yet and still you object?
Vamsi, you are from a political
family. Your father is an MP.
You studied in a top international
school in Hyderabad.
You went to study engineering in USA.
And then, you finished your MBA in London.
Even though you are so well-educated,
you still find it difficult to understand.
Take your hands out of your
pocket. This is a court.
Yeah, sure.
Okay, you agreed to give them
a lift and they got into your vehicle.
But why did you take them to the resort
instead of dropping them in the city?
As soon as they got in the car,
they said that they were hungry.
We felt pity.
We thought they might have
dinner with us at the resort.
Vamsi, they are total strangers to you.
You've never met them before.
Weren't you suspicious when they
seemed too friendly in the car?
I really didn't
suspect anything in the car.
I just thought that they
were a friendly bunch.
But... when we went to the
resort, I grew suspicious.
How?
They gave hints such as over-glancing
at us, touching us while talking etc.
She didn't ask you directly?
Not at that time, sir.
When we went into the room,
Pallavi fixed me a drink...
sat beside me and began to touch me.
Obviously, I have responded.
Then, she asked me on the face.
What did she ask?
Did she tell you that you
can pay her and enjoy her?
Yes.
After listening to that,
you got scared, right?
Yes.
Objection, your honour!
Mr Multi-talented Nanda, if you wanted to
play double role, why did you call him?
Keep playing his part and yours,
and we can be done with this!
Mr. Nanda Gopal,
please don't lead the witness.
Yes, sir.
Go on.
So, like I was saying,
when she asked me directly...
That is when I
understood about those girls.
So, I told her,
"Listen, I am not interested. This
isn't right. Please leave from there."
But she didn't listen to me.
"Doesn't matter if you've enjoyed
yourself or not, you will have to pay me."
"If not, I'll scream that you have
raped me." That's how she threatened me.
Even then, I didn't accept.
With that, she got really angry
and hit me on the head with a
bottle that was right there.
That's how it went down, sir.
That's all, your honour.
Your honour...
Yes, carry on.
Mr Vamsi
you mentioned earlier that
Pallavi gave you a few hints.
What type of hints?
She was talking very openly,
smiling while she was talking,
touching me while talking etc.
Smiling while speaking and
touching you, is that all?
Yes.
Your honour, rule number two.
No girl shall talk to a guy
openly and with a smile.
And when she speaks,
she mustn't touch the boy.
So, if she speaks with a smile, it is
concluded that she gave a hint to the guy.
And if she touches the guy,
it means she gave him a signal.
So, when boys talk with a smile,
it is lauded as good communication skills.
And when a girl does the
same, she is immoral.
Something as basic as a smile
decides a girl's character.
It leads to her being branded
as a promiscuous woman.
It leads to branding.
Prakruti Resort Case has
 taken on political tones.
The cunning girls have
 targeted boys with rich background.
Girls who are addicted to city life are
 ready to go to any extent for money.
Because they spent the
 night at a resort with boys,
it has led to a lot of suspicion
 about the girls' character.
Hi-tech prostitution cases are on
 the rise in the city these days.
The netizens are of the opinion that
 this case belongs to the same category.
Buddy, look at her...
Prakruti resort case.
Oh goodness! The girl looks so hot!
What did you say?
Nothing, sir. Nothing.
Don't escape. Don't hide. Face the world.
Sir, what I'm telling you is the truth.
These girls return home
very late in the night.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Not just me,
a lot of people from the colony saw it.
Sir, guys too keep going
to their home at nights.
-This is a very regular thing, sir.
-Sir...
That's all, your honour.
-Mr Chari,
-Sir.
The guys who visited them in the
night might be their friends, right?
Yes, they might be their
friends or otherwise.
So, you mean to say you
crawled into their balcony using the pipes
and peeked inside to see
how the boys were behaving?
Of course, not! It's not right
to peek into other's houses.
So, you never saw what was
happening inside their homes.
No, sir.
So, you never saw them taking money
from the boys or sleeping with them?
-No, sir. But...
-Hey!
There is no place for the word 'but'
between the truth and a lie, Mr Chari!
These days people are getting
very creative, your honour.
Since there is no tax
or GST to imagine things,
everyone is letting their
imagination run wild.
But the important point that he
mentioned in what he told was,
the girls return home
very late in the nights.
It's a point to be noted, your honour.
Rule number three.
The small hand in our wall-clocks
too judge a woman's character.
When a girl goes alone in the night,
the bikes, cars and every
other vehicle slows down.
The side mirrors gets adjusted down,
people sprout a long neck like a giraffe,
and their gazes get sharper.
But this great human
behaviour comes out
only when they see a girl
going alone at night, on the roads.
But this behavior is not
exhibited in the morning, your honour.
When the boys go out at
night, it is deemed as fun.
And when the girls do the
same, it is immoral behavior.
Your honour, I would like to
cross examine my client, Pallavi.
Go ahead.
Ms Pallavi,
how did you get acquainted with
these guys and how did you meet?
That night, the vehicle in which we
were travelling broke down suddenly.
When we couldn't figure out how to get
out of there, these guys showed up.
Vishwa is my schoolmate.
Vamsi and Bunty were with him in the car.
So, one of the guys who
came there is your friend.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
After they came, we felt safe.
That is why we went with them.
When you got stuck in
the middle of the way,
they gave you lift, took you
for dinner and cared for you.
But why was it necessary
to hit Vamsi with a bottle?
He pulled me violently
towards him and held me.
And he didn't let me go.
When someone touches you wherever
they please, it would be very disgusting.
I begged him numerous times to
let me go, but he didn't do that.
At that point of time,
I don't know what got into me.
I didn't know what to do.
But...
I am really sorry.
I really didn't expect that
it would hurt him so badly.
It wasn't intentional.
When someone tries to assault
you, what can one do, sir?
Okay.
This is what happened, your honour.
Drama! Drama! High voltage drama!
Your honour, this girl isn't just acting.
She is simply living the lie.
She twisted the events of the night to
suit her narrative
and illustrated it very well. Brilliant!
But I am going to make you
spill all the bits of truth you hid.
Does your family own a home in Hyderabad?
Yes, sir.
Where is it?
Hayathnagar.
What is the reason to live with
your friends instead of your parents?
Sir, I am a working woman
with a software job.
There is a shift system at where I work.
It's very difficult to travel
that far, late in the night.
Moreover, my parents won't
sleep until I reach home.
They keep worrying.
I didn't want to trouble them, that's why.
Is it because you didn't want
to trouble your parents
or because living with them makes
it impossible to do such work?
Your honour, there are lakhs
of working women in Hyderabad.
They take the bus or a cab or
even metro to travel from
one corner of the city to another and
return home happily after the work.
Why is that you have a problem
with that unlike all other women?
Okay.
I will ask you directly.
What do you charge?
How much did you charge them?
Objection, your honour!
Mr Nanda Gopal!
Be careful with your words!
And Mr Satya Dev...
Present your arguments. Don't make noise.
This is a court.
If you repeat this again, I will
consider this as contempt of the court.
Sorry, sir.
Continue.
Your honour,
Pallavi's story is incredulous.
Would any girl go to a resort
with a guy who she has just met?
It's because we knew them and felt safe.
I shouldn't have gone with them, sir.
I made a mistake.
This isn't a mistake, madam.
This is a calculated move.
You've cleverly devised a plan to
do this and put it into action.
No, sir.
You told us that those guys seemed safe.
What does that mean?
It means that they are good
guys and are safe to be around.
Yes, sir. But...
See, this is your mode of operation.
You use the ruse of car break down
and ask for a lift from
people driving in a rich car.
And you pretend to be hungry after you get
into the car and go to a resort with them.
And once you reach there, you'd
blackmail them and extort money.
This time, that plan didn't work out.
And out of that anger, you have hit Vamsi.
Sir...
Why're you coming up with false narratives
despite having all these truths?
Sir... I didn't know if they were
rich or influential people at that time.
Okay. Alright. Okay, your honour.
Let's assume that
you have been to the resort for
dinner without any vested interest.
But, why did you booze?
Why did you have a drink?
Answer me.
He offered it to me.
Your honour, the photographic
evidence is with you.
Sir... the table there was very small.
Vamsi was quite far away.
When he asked me, I poured him
in a glass and gave it to him.
Note this point, your honour.
She has fixed the drink
and got Vamsi drunk.
She is very intelligent.
As soon as they went into the room,
she began to implement her plan.
Sir... He was far...
Your honour, she went with people
who were total strangers to her.
So, instead of focusing on
her statements as evidence,
I request you to look
at the video evidence.
Footage from camera one.
Zareena was the one who came out first.
Behind her, Divya and Pallavi came out.
The three of them discussed about money.
And they went back inside the room
once they decided on the amount.
Footage from camera two, your honour.
Divya came out with Bunty.
Both of them went
into room number 503.
Bunty went inside and switched on
the light. Divya closed the door.
After some time, the lights went off.
This is footage three, your honour.
Zareena came out with Vishwa
and went to another room.
After some time, there were
screams heard from Vamsi's room.
Everyone ran towards Vamsi's room.
Inside the room,
Pallavi has demanded for extra amount.
Vamsi didn't agree to it.
So, Pallavi attacked Vamsi with a bottle.
And your honour...
Just look at this.
As soon as she understood the
gravity of what's she's done,
the three girls fled together.
They just ran away.
If they were not at fault,
why would they run away from there?
Shouldn't they have gone
directly to the police station?
But, why would such kind of women
approach the police station, your honour?
They can't.
So, your honour,
I would like you to notice two important
points discussed over here today.
One, the statement given by
the eye witness, waiter Srinivas.
And secondly...
even in the area where
these girls are residing,
there is a suspicion that these girls
have been carrying out such activities.
This is bloody bullcrap!
Pallavi! Language!
That's all your honour.
What you and your clients
were saying are lies!
Sir... Sir... We didn't
go there for money.
They said that they would drop us after
dinner. So we believed them and went.
It's because we believed
them, so we went with them.
Sir...
the entire room was filled
with cigarette smoke.
Divya didn't return from the next room.
That is why Zareena went
out in search for Divya.
And when I wanted to
go out to talk to them,
he caught my hand and
pulled me towards him, sir.
I requested to let go of
me, but he didn't do that.
He caught me tightly and tried
to force himself on me, sir.
I didn't know how to escape from
there and so I hit him with a bottle.
If he does something like this again,
it wouldn't be a bottle.
I would break his skull with a rod!
Pallavi!
Next time under this is court...
-What else do you want me to do, sir?
-I will have you removed!
The court is adjourned!
Sir!
Sir, I didn't ask for money.
-Sir, I didn't take any money.
-Pallavi...
-Pallavi...
-Sir...
We are not such kind of
women. Believe us, please.
Please believe us, sir.
They are all lying!
Please believe us.
Zareena,
send Pallavi to our home in the evening.
From now on, she is going to stay at home.
"The deep cries of pain
that touch the sky"
"Who is going to listen it?"
"The sighs that constantly
escape your heart,"
"Who is going to correct it?"
"Such a charming life is being blemished"
"The eyes that dreamt are
now overflowing with tears"
"Every new day brings pain"
"Such a beautiful life is
now in constant turmoil"
"What is your sin?
What is your crime?"
"Everything slipped into
darkness in an instant"
"Your pain is never going to go away
and this world will never change"
"No matter the number of generations,
your story remains the same"
"Oh woman... Oh woman...
Is there no value to your heart?"
"Oh woman... Oh woman...
Is there no smile written into your fate?"
"They take you for
granted and belittle you"
"From ages, you've been the weak one"
"They blame you and
they excommunicate you"
"It's a mistake that
you were born a woman"
"Oh woman... Oh woman...
Is there no value to your heart?"
"Oh woman... Oh woman... Is
there no value to your heart?"
"Oh woman... Oh woman...
Is there no smile written into your fate?"
"Oh woman... Oh woman...
Is there no smile written into your fate?"
Your honour,
I would like to call inspector Sarla Devi.
Proceed.
Superwoman!
Sir?
Superwoman!
Mr Satya Dev.
Super... Super...
Superwoman, Sarla Devi.
Why didn't you arrest Pallavi immediately
after the boys filed the complaint?
Sir, she was absconding. We've been
searching for her but to no avail.
She must have been secretly hiding, sir.
Well, if she was secretly hiding,
how is it that you found
her at her home so easily?
We received a tip-off, sir.
-A tip-off?
-Yes, sir.
Who gave you the tip-off?
Our undercover constables were
placed around her apartment building.
Undercover constables were
placed around her apartment building?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Why are you lying, madam?
No, sir. The constables were
there around the building.
She is lying, your honour.
It's very evident from her face.
Why will I lie, sir?
You are lying.
No, sir. Our policemen were there.
You are lying.
No, sir.
It's a lie!
-No, sir.
-It's a lie!
-It's a lie! It's a lie! It's a lie!
-No, sir.
Objection, your honour.
Please instruct the defense
lawyer to stop scaring the inspector
and prove his claim with facts.
Of course, Mr Nanda.
We shall do that for sure.
Let's get to the exact point and carry
forward from there, Mr Nanda.
Enough with your performance. Please, sit.
Did you write this report, sir?
Yes, sir. I wrote it.
You weren't on duty on that day, right?
Apparently, you went to a
relative's wedding in Alwal.
Isn't this you?
Yes, sir.
This sparkling diamond
necklace too looks beautiful.
If it's true that you
were off-duty on that day,
how did you write the report?
Sir, I returned by that time.
So, you returned from Alwal
function hall to Moinabad police station
in just 15 minutes?
Well, the distance is 40 kilometres and
the route is covered with flyover works.
Generally, the journey time would
an hour and half for anyone.
But superwoman Ms Sarla Devi
took only fifteen minutes.
Please tell us your secret, lady.
Is that magic or a secret?
Whatever it is, tell us.
Shall I tell you your secret?
You must have wings like a bird
or you must have the ability to fly
in the air like Lord Hanuman.
Or else, it's impossible.
Sir, since it was a very important issue,
I just came there in jet speed.
Wow!
Jet speed!
So, you started the car in Alwal,
travelled at the speed of 300 kmph,
hit whoever came in your way and
reached Moinabad Police station?
Woah!
Amazing!
Did you get it now why I have
called you a superwoman?
You do not belong in
the police department.
You should have been in
the F1 racing circuit.
In the police department,
all you'll get are small diamonds.
But if you are in racing, you would
get big diamonds... very big diamonds.
It's useless to stare at me in anger.
Okay,
let's assume that you did get to
the police station in jet speed.
Well then, what about the report?
Why did you write only two lines?
Only two lines...
Is it because the government
is practicing austerity
that you wrote only
two lines in the report?
Two lines, your honour.
Two lines.
Vemula Pallavi tried to kill Vamsi
by hitting him with a bottle and caused
grievous injury, at Prakruthi resorts.
Sir, since the message is conveyed in
two lines, what else is there to write?
Oh really? How can it be clear so easily?
You have mentioned Pallavi's surname, but
why haven't you written Vamsi's surname?
So, is there any closeness between
you and Vamsi? Any friendship?
What's there between both of you that
made you skip writing his surname?
Sir, I just wrote what's
necessary for the case.
What more can be written on
that incident in the diary?
So, you wrote only what is needed
for the case as per your convenience.
-Right?
-Sir, how can we write like that?
It's because you wrote exactly in that
manner that led to these questions.
This is the past report which you
wrote for a cell phone theft case.
Borukapu Kiran Kumar
has his phone in his pocket when
took a shared ride in an autorickshaw.
But when he got down and checked his
pockets, he couldn't find his phone.
You wrote G4. But you have struck it
off and and corrected it as 4G as well.
What is with your
dedication for this case?
And after those details,
you wrote another ten lines of the report.
When a China-made mobile phone
was lost, you wrote an epic.
But for such a big issue and incident,
how come you wrote only two lines?
Two lines?
Why?
Why?
Because there was only a little space left
on that page of the
complaint diary for that date.
Am I right?
Pallavi filed a Zero FIR against
Vamsi and his friends on May 10th.
But you haven't taken any
action and neglected the issue.
Because of the your sheer negligence,
they've kidnapped and molested her.
If only you had taken some action,
she wouldn't have been molested.
Despite that, the girl was bravely came to
you and pressured you into taking action.
You realised that the incident
was taking a serious turn.
Then, as per the plan, you've fabricated a
report dated May 5th which indicates that
Vamsi was the first to file
a complaint against Pallavi.
You went back to that
date and filed a case.
Your honour,
if Vamsi really did file a complaint
immediately after the incident...
Pallavi has been to the police station
and filed a complaint after five days.
Why didn't the police arrest Pallavi then?
Why didn't they arrest her?
That's because Vamsi
haven't filed a complaint yet.
After my client Pallavi
reported the incident,
the police hurried to register Vamsi's
complaint by backdating the report.
They have colluded to file
a false FIR, your honour.
They have filed a false FIR against
an innocent girl, your honour.
[glass shatters]
Vamsi, this is a court-case.
You shouldn't be fighting on
the roads or in the toilets.
you should do it in the court.
Well, what do you want me to do, sir?
He has examined all the loopholes in our
case and turned the case in their favour.
It is not that easy.
Don't take unnecessary action
and complicate this case.
Alright. Do something.
Better do something and fast, please.
Miss Pallavi...
are you are a virgin?
Objection, your honour.
Is it relevant?
Yes, your honour. It is relevant.
Tell me,
are you a virgin or not?
In that case, we can do
this session on camera.
You wouldn't feel uncomfortable.
No, sir
I didn't do anything wrong.
-I can answer this openly, in the court.
-I like the spirit.
Tell me now.
Are you a virgin?
Okay.
Now, tell it loudly so
that it can be heard.
Are you a virgin?
-No.
-No.
At what age did you lose your virginity?
Objection, your honour.
Mr Nanda...
what's the relevance of
your questions to this case?
There is relevance, your honour.
We must know the character of this girl.
Vakeel Saab, will you please chill?
You tell me.
At what age did you lose your virginity?
Twenty-one.
I didn't hear you.
-Twenty-one.
-Twenty-one!
Really?
Or is it before that?
Objection!
Tell me.
Twenty-one.
-With whom?
-Objection!
Satya Dev.
How many times?
Objection!
Satya Dev!
With how many guys?
Objection!
How much did you earn?
What kind of questions
are you asking me, sir?
Did you have an abortion or not?
-Objection!
-Nanda Gopal!
-What kind of questions are you asking me?
-Did you have an abortion or not?
Objection!
Satya Dev!
Order! Order!
Hey Nanda!
-Are you a pimp or a lawyer?
-What is it now?
-How is this related to the case?
-What are you going to do?
-I would ask... What can you do about it?-Order! Order!
Would you ask your sisters
in this similar manner?
Mr Satya Dev!
Hey Nanda...
-Is this something you ask a girl this?
-Are you going to hit me?
Order! Order! Order!
Mr Nanda Gopal!
-Are you a rowdy or a lawyer?
-Go ahead and hit me!
-Hit you?
-Go ahead.
-Hitting you is not a big deal for me.
-Come on, hit me.
-I can hit you in a very bad way.
-Satya Dev!
-Mr Satya Dev!
-Should I hit you?
-Should I hit you?-Nanda Gopal...
Come on, hit me...
-Satya Dev.
-Sir... Sir...
What is this?
Sir... Sir... Please sir.
This is outrageous! What are you doing?
This is contempt of the court.
I am referring bar council
to suspend both of you.
Vakeel Saab has physically
 assaulted lawyer Nanda Gopal in the court.
The judge has referred
them to the Bar Council.
The future of the girls
is in a great doubt.
Will the girls be served with justice?
Will Vakeel Saab be able to practice law?
Sir, it is his thing to physically assault
lawyers in the court and destroy property.
The other lawyer provoked Vakeel Saab.
That is why he has reacted in that
manner. What's wrong with that?
So? Does that call for physical abuse?
If provoked, what else can one do?
-It's wrong to physically abuse.
-He is wrong. He provoked first.
[overlap of voices] What are you talking?
It's because he did the same thing
before and got suspended for four years.
If he is left unchecked,
he would do the same to us as well.
That is why his license needs
to be cancelled permanently.
Yes!
[sloganeering] His license
should be suspended!
[mic echoes]
[sloganeering]
Your job is to argue for those who fight.
But why would you
fight amongst yourselves?
It's ridiculous!
Huh!
Mr Nanda Gopal...
Being a senior,
how come you lost
control of your temper?
Anyway,
since you were physically
assaulted, we are excusing you.
Mr Satya Dev has been suspended
earlier due to a similar incident.
This time, everyone is demanding
that his license be revoked.
But,
as a human rights lawyer,
looking at the contribution
he has made to the society,
we are issuing a final
warning against him.
If he threatens or assaults anyone
in the court one more time,
his license will be permanently revoked.
He will never be able to practice
law in his life ever again.
Be careful!
Sure sir.
Sir...
Thank you, sir.
Satya...
Most of the lawyers here fight in
the court just to win the case.
There isn't a single one amongst them who
wishes to fight for the triumph of justice
I know that your's not anger.
It is an aggression born
out of watching injustice.
It's not your weakness.
It's a weapon.
Use it carefully.
Sure sir.
Your goal is much greater
than your aggression.
All the best.
Thank you, sir.
People need you now.
Bye, sir.
Your honour,
in the last session of the court...
Mr Nanda kept questioning
about Pallavi's virginity.
Pallavi was twenty-one at that time.
That means she was an
adult in the eyes of law.
Kindly note this point.
Who was the guy?
Sir...
It was my boyfriend Abhi.
Did Abhi pay money?
Sir, what kind of a question is that?
Just answer the question.
Did he pay you or not?
He didn't.
Well, if he didn't pay you
for money, did he force you?
Did he force you?
He did not force me...
nor did he pay me.
We liked each other.
We were in love with each other.
We wanted to do it and we did it.
That was an act of love.
So, it was based on liking
each other and love.
-He didn't pay you.
-Yes, sir.
He didn't force you.
Kindly note this point, your honour.
It happened because of Pallavi's consent.
No one paid her and no one forced her.
Pallavi...
That day, in Prakruti Resorts,
when Vamshi tried to force you,
how did you tell him in no uncertain
terms that you did not interest?
Pallavi, answer me.
Sir... I did not give my consent.
Answer properly.
What did you say to him
and what did you do?
Sir, I...
I pushed him away.
I told him to leave me
alone and not to force me.
What else did you do?
I said, "Don't..."
"No."
I said, "No."
Pallavi, say it loud enough
for the court to hear.
Say it loud enough that all the
people in the court can hear you.
I said, "No."
I said, "No."
You said, "No."
You told him no. Am I right?
Yes, sir.
Good.
She said no, your honour.
She told him 'no'.
Despite that, Vamsi haven't let her go
and tried to force.
Unable to bear that,
she reacted in that manner.
When a girl repeatedly kept saying no,
he ignored that and tried to force her.
What else can a girl trapped in such
a situation do to protect herself?
That is why she took it a step further.
To defend oneself, it is constitutionally
granted fundamental right.
It's a right of private defense.
It is a fundamental right to
protect themselves, your honour.
Fundamental right!
Thank you.
Okay. Okay, your honour.
According to the defense, Pallavi reacted
that way because she didn't consent.
But why didn't Zareena
hit Vishwa with a bottle?
Why didn't Divya do that to Bunty?
It's because these three girls
went to the resort for money...
and I'll prove this in
this court, your honour!
I request you to please call up Zareena.
Are you the only earning
member in your family?
Yes.
So, your entire family is dependent
on your earnings for survival?
Yes.
Your mother has a kidney problem.
So, her treatment such as dialysis
must be costing you a lot.
Yes.
How much is your monthly salary?
Thirty thousand.
Thirty thousand!
So, that means you badly need money.
Yes, sir but...
Yes, you do... You do.
So, how are you managing?
Do you have any other financial support?
No?
Do you know someone who runs a travel
business, and goes by the name Anwar?
Yes, sir.
He is my friend.
I go to their home too.
So, the business is run
from home? Home service.
Objection, your honour!
Vakeel Saab,
I am not the one to beat...
Yes, I know. I know you
don't beat around the bush.
You'd straight away get to
the point and connect the dots.
But make sure you
don't break any connection.
Yes, I am on that job... I'll do it.
Your honour,
this is Zareena's bank statement.
A copy of it has already
been submitted to you.
If you take a look at this, you would
understand what sort of a woman she is.
Anwar and Zareena are not friends.
This is a pure business relationship.
He is a regular customer of hers.
Objection, your honour!
How can you talk like that, sir?
Because I have a proof, madam.
For the past three years...
there's been a money transfer of 25,000
rupees from his account
to yours every month.
What does that mean?
Sir, I took a loan,
for my mother's treatment.
I am repaying that money.
Why don't you show talk
about that transaction?
I am getting to it, your
honour. I am getting to it.
She's been repaying it.
But how long has that been going on?
Only after this case has been filed.
She already knew that this detail is going
to get revealed during investigation.
She is an expert who does
everything with a well devised plan.
She is a professional.
Sir, why is it that you are
circling everything back to that?
We have decided to get married.
Our families have agreed to it as well.
But, the wedding was called
off because of this case.
That is why I am repaying him.
You are repaying him, madam.
You needed the money and so, you took it.
That's the nature of your family.
You constantly need money.
That is why your resort to this kind
of work and fulfil your need for money.
Right?
You went into another room with
Vishwa for this very reason.
Objection, your honour!
A girl went into another
room with a boy, your honour!
Objection, your honour!
-Counsels.
-I've submitted her mother's bills as well
Objection your, honour.
Counsels.
-This is their only income source.
-Objection your, honour!
-What's with is your objection?
-Objection!
Why are you pointing your hand
at me? Are you going to hit me?
Are you thinking about
hitting me like the other day?
I was wondering why I didn't hit
you and let you go on the other day.
Order!
Mr Satya Dev!
Nanda Gopal!
Please keep the dignity of the court.
Sorry, sir.
I am sorry, your honour.
Tell me.
My friends too would help me.
So, your friends help you
in getting your ends meet?
I too have a lot of friends but none of
them help me in getting my ends meet.
Admit it!
Just admit to the truth that you earn
money through sleeping with others.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have gone into
another room with Vishwa on that day.
Yes, I shouldn't have gone!
I shouldn't have gone!
I have been suffering right from that
day until today for having gone out!
If I had not gone out...
all of this wouldn't have happened?
If it did happen, only the two of
us would have been the victims.
Such kind of antics do
not work here, madam.
Everything about you got revealed.
Did you take the money or not?
Are you going to insult me
like you did to Pallavi?
Just answer the question.
Did you take the money or not?
Are you trying to prove in front
of everyone that we took money?
I am one hundred percent
certain that you took money.
If not, this wouldn't have happened!
You would have gone home and they
would have gone back to their homes too.
You are trying to ruin my
innocent clients' honour.
You already knew that
they were a rich bunch.
That is why you have targeted them.
You took them there and
blackmailed them emotionally.
-Okay! Okay! Okay!
-You took the money...
-You took the money...
-Okay! Okay! Okay!
-We took money.
-You took money.
-She accepted...
-Objection.
-Objection.-She accepted...
-We took the money!
-That's it, your honour.
Zareena!
Your honour, I need to talk
to my client. Your honour!
Sir, please.
Please allow me to speak.
I need to speak.
We asked for money.
We demanded for money
and we took the money.
Sister, why are you saying that?
We didn't take the money.
Divya!
Please keep quiet.
Your honour, I need to talk to my client.
Please sit down, sir.
Please sit down.
Please let me speak.
Sir, we took the money.
But after we took the money,
Pallavi changed her mind.
She doesn't want it. She told him no.
She kept telling them
that she doesn't want it.
But, Vamsi...
when he caught her and
tried to molest her,
She... she reacted in that manner.
You tell me, sir.
You tell me, sir...
Was her act wrong, according to law?
Was her act wrong?
Or his act?
[sobbing]
This session of the court is adjourned.
Sorry.
When Vakeel Saab
fought for people like us...
they have deserted him in the
middle of the case at that time,
and now, we did the same.
When we admitted that we took the
money, the case was as good as done.
Now, we don't have the
courage to face him.
Please tell him to forgive us.
Zareena...
you were so brave to admit in the
court about what you haven't done.
But why would you be scared now?
Defeat is not something
that others get to decide.
We should be the one to decide about it.
We are not defeated until we admit it.
When you stand up for the
truth, you'd lose a lot of things.
You must be ready for all
that and move forward.
Still, the case is alive.
Get ready for tomorrow.
We've almost won this case.
The only thing remaining
is the final judgement.
But there is a last
chance for them to win.
Cross examining you tomorrow.
Whatever he asks...
make sure you provoke
him by answering calmly.
If he loses his balance even a
bit, he will lose this case.
His license would be cancelled.
He will never be able to
set foot in the court again.
Spoiled brat! Vamsi.
Objection!
Okay, just Vamsi...
So, if a girl comes to you,
talks to you with a smile and touches you,
do you think she is
inviting you to sleep with her?
No.
I didn't say that.
But, that's how it was
written in the complaint.
I only told about this case.
At other times,
it depends on the circumstances.
Depends... on what?
Depends on when, where and how they meet.
So, according to you,
does the place of meeting
determine a woman's character?
So, on that night...
I mean the night of the
incident at Prakruti Resort,
were you intoxicated?
Yes, I was.
So, you were intoxicated...
while you were intoxicated,
you held Pallavi tightly...
but she didn't consent,
so you tried to force her...
and she has hit you.
It could have happened that way, right?
Yeah...
it could have happened but that was
not what had happened on that night.
Congratulations!
Heartfelt congratulations!
I heard that your wedding is fixed with
the Minister Devikarani's daughter.
Excuse me?
What's the connection between
my personal life and this case?
Even the case you have filed against
my client is not connected to her.
I see where you are going with this.
Are you trying to prove that I
am characterless just like them?
I don't have to prove it, Mr Vamsi.
Are you getting angry?
You are scowling badly.
Well, I am asking you about your
marriage, not about some stranger's.
I am not getting anger.
But why are you talking
about my personal life?
Mr Vamsi, is this how
you behave all the time?
If someone doesn't listen or obey you,
do you get angry like this? Huh?
Why the hell are you
constantly bringing this up?
What did you say?
Why the hell are you constantly
trying to bring this up?
Vamsi...
So informal?
I've been addressing you so respectfully
and you on the other hand,
were being disrespectful.
Sir, blame it on your upbringing
and his manners.
What can we do about it?
Do you visit sex workers?
No, sir.
So, it was your first time in that resort.
Yes. That was my first
time in that situation.
-Are you a virgin?
-What?
Objection, your honour!
You can ask this question to the
girls but I can't ask the boys?
Is it fair, Mr Nanda?
Please sit down.
Sit down. That's enough.
Alright. Do you invite every girl
that you meet, to dinner?
-They said that they were hungry.
-Uhuh.
They said that they were hungry!
So, we invited them.
How am I to know they
were promiscuous women?
I was being humane.
That's the mistake I made.
So, you gave them a drink
because you were trying to be humane?
Pallavi was the one who fixed the drink
on that day. Didn't you see the photo?
Mr Vamsi, why are you
not admitting the truth?
Are you scared that you might lose
respect and as well your political career?
Or are you scared that your
marriage with the minister's daughter
would be called off?
Shall I tell you?
You are scared that you'd end up in jail
if this sexual assault case gets proved.
That is why you have
fabricated a case against my client
and filed a counter case against her.
Objection, your honour!
What's there to object, Mr Nanda Gopal?
The girls already admitted that
they took money, your honour.
You sit down.
Carry on, Mr Satya Dev.
Thank you, sir.
Do the women in your family booze?
No, only men consume liquor.
What about your mother or your sister?
Women from a good
family do not drink alcohol.
Do they go to parties?
They attend family gatherings.
They go to functions organized by the
relatives. They do not go to parties.
So, the women who go to functions are good
and those who go to parties are bad.
Okay.
Your sister was seen
drinking liquor at a party.
What do you have to say to this?
Hey... What are you doing?
Put that photo down. Just put it down!
Do you know who you are speaking to?
Go and talk to your father
-He will tell you.
-Objection, your honour!
He is asking unnecessary
questions and scaring my client.
Some truths do scare, your honour!
Some truths absolutely scare!
This is nonsense!
My sister doesn't do
things in this manner.
Attending parties and going
to resorts upon calling...
Women like them indulge
in that kind of behavior.
Girls from good families do
not indulge in such behavior.
And you know what?
Such kind of women will
certainly face things like this!
It must not happen!
It should definitely not happen!
You think it's your birth-right
and have been doing such things.
Objection, your honour!
One second, sir.
Let me talk!
Heading to the resort as soon as
they were invited and cracking jokes...
Not just me, but any guy would
think of that girl to be of that kind.
I too thought the same!
Otherwise, why would
they come to the resort?
Why would they come into the room?
Why the hell would they
come into the room?
They didn't know that they
were going to be raped by you.
-Rape? What do you mean rape?
-Vamsi!
One second, sir.
Ask anyone who is here...
Women like them will always be
subjected to such kind of treatment.
Do you know what they call such women?
-[voice muted]-Order!
They are called... [voice muted]
These people are nothing
but low grade [voice muted]
Vamsi, behave yourself!
They are road side [voice muted]
-They sell their bodies for money.
-Vamsi!
-And you dare drag me to the courts?
- Keep the dignity of the court!
As soon as you get an invite...
-Sir...-you'd come to resort.
-Vamsi, you can't talk like this!
-I will show you what I'm made of.
-Mr Nanda Gopal! Control your client!
-I will skin you all alive!
-You will pay for this... [voice muted]
-Order... Order...
Order...
Satya, yours is not anger.
It is the aggression that is born
 out of watching injustice.
It's not your weakness!
It's a weapon.
Use it carefully!
Nothing else.
Nothing else.
-Vamsi... behave.
-Mark my words, Satyadev.
You've done the biggest
blunder in your life.
Thank you, Vamsi.
Thank you.
Your honour,
you've seen for yourself
the kind of mindset he has.
That's why that incident
took place on that day.
Drinking alcohol is injurious to health.
It applies to both men and women.
Don't assume that men would fall down and
women sleep around when they are drunk.
How can an individual's
character be judged,
based on the habits they
possess, your honour?
Girls must not wear jeans, skirts...
They must never wear
what they want to.
Women's clothing is not a danger to them.
It's a danger to the boys.
That's because they get so much tempted.
That is why we must protect
innocent boys such as these.
But...
A nine-month-old girl baby,
a six-year-old female child
who plays in the yard,
a ten-year-old girl who goes to school,
a twenty-five-year-old
mother who stays at home,
and even a bedridden sixty-year-old
woman... None of them are being spared.
How are these women tempting them?
How are they tempting them?
If it is a woman and if she
is alone, that's enough!
They would do anything to them!
-Anything!
-Objection, your honour!
Defense lawyer is generalizing the
issue and trying to gain sympathy.
But we need focus on this issue.
The so called natured of these
girls have already been proved.
They admitted that they took money.
And you have already examined the
evidence with regards to that.
Please, your honour.
Consider the pieces of evidence and
please punish them
with stringent punishment.
You must save my innocent
clients as well as the society.
That's because,
women such as these are
dangerous to the society.
You are right, Mr Nanda.
Women such as these are really
dangerous for the society.
That is why, impose a
curfew for women after 6 pm.
Don't educate them and
don't let them do jobs.
Confine them behind the doors and veil
by tying them with shackles of tradition.
Because she was born a woman, she doesn't
have the right to go out after 6 pm.
She doesn't have the right to
wander on the streets alone.
She doesn't have the right
to laugh amidst people.
She doesn't have the
right to cry if she is sad.
She doesn't, at least, have the right
to breathe fresh air outside either!
Because, we seek only
amusement from women.
As soon as they demand their rights,
they will be made to stand inside the
witness box and branded as prostitute.
A woman is not a sketch that would
be found on his bathroom walls.
She is the mother who gave birth
to a man and raised him.
When the pests are in a man's head,
they are trying to spray the pesticide on
women? How is that right, your honour?
How is that right?
Your honour,
a girl doesn't like to wear a
dress which she doesn't like.
If that's the case, how is she going
to react when someone touches her
without her consent, your honour?
No man has the right to touch a
woman who doesn't wish to be touched.
When she says no, it is an
absolute no! That's it. Period.
When she says don't touch,
she mustn't be touched!
Doesn't matter if it is her friend
or her boyfriend or even her husband.
That night, if she didn't protest,
she would have remained
as a Nirbhaya or a Disha.
That is when the humanity in us
would kick in and we'd light candles,
shower flower petals on the photo of
the victim, march at the Tank Bund,
arrange debates on television,
post tweets on Twitter
and forget all about it
after a week, your honour.
That is what we can do.
What Pallavi did was right, your honour.
Not just Pallavi, any girl in that
situation must react in the same manner.
Not just patience,
but women have the courage
and the ability to revolt as well.
They must revolt, your honour.
Women must revolt.
Your honour...
Law is codified righteousness.
The saying that the entire nation
believes is, 'Truth alone triumphs.'
What is right must stand
and the truth must triumph.
Truth alone should triumph, your honour!
Truth alone should triumph.
I rest my case, your honour.
Jai Hind!
Case passed over for judgment.
Judgment will be announced tomorrow.
Because of those girls,
my family's reputation and my political
career has been completely damaged.
I won't leave them.
Zareena...
Come, let's go.
Hey... Hey...
What's up, kid?
I know how to argue a case in the court
as well as thrash the hell
out of you by removing my coat.
Ow!
[glass shatters]
[glass shatters]
[groans]
The court believes...
this is a new beginning.
The allegations against Vemula Pallavi
are Section 307, attempt to murder.
There are evidences to prove so as well.
But the court believes that this
case was registered with malintent.
That is why, the court dismisses
all the charges against her.
There is no evidence for the charges filed
against Zareena Begum and Divya Naik.
The court finds Korentla Vamsi guilty
under section 506: criminal intimidation
and section 354: outraging
modesty of a woman.
Korentla Vamsi is sentenced to
seven years of rigorous imprisonment.
Kasarla Shiva,
Bunty alias Koduri Ramana...
For kidnapping and molesting Pallavi,
they are sentenced 3 years of imprisonment
and a fine of 10,000 rupees each.
Along with this,
it's been decided that Vishwa
should be let off with a warning.
The court is dismissed.
Thank... Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Mr Nanda...
Losing is not humiliation.
It's an opportunity to better ourselves.
All the best.
Thanks.
You are welcome.
Sir...
Thank you.
[overlap of voices] Vakeel
Saab... Sir... Sir...
Vakeel Saab!
Vakeel Saab is here for us.
He has come for us once again.
We came here with petitions
hoping that you'd bring us justice.
Sir, our village has been at
the receiving end of injustice.
Please help us get justice.
You must help us.
I don't think we need to go
through these formalities.
You know the kind of person I am.
And I know very well about your sorrows.
You and I are not different. We are
one and our problems are the same.
Let's fight together!
[in unison] Let's fight together!
-Let's fight together!
-[in unison] Let's fight together!
-Let's fight together!
-[in unison] Let's fight together!
[chanting]
Zareena...
I am sorry, Zareena.
Please don't come to my office ever again.
Don't try to meet me ever again.
Zareena...
(Chants)
Congrats!
Thanks.
