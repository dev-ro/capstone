Once upon a time.
There were three brothers.
Ákos the marketing manager, Tamás
the movie director. And... András.
They all had their daydreams:
Ákos about his girlfriend Timi...
and Ági... and Kati...
and Zsuzsi...
Tamás about directing his first film.
 "The City of Sin".
And András
about his lottery numbers.
One day a Hollywood producer
named Alex Brubeck showed up
with the offer to finance Tamás's film.
 If the boys contributed with 60 million.
And the brothers teamed up
to make Tamás's dream come true.
Ákos used his connections
to raise money.
Tamás used his girlfriend
to convince Alex...
Everyone liked Alex. Even the
soap opera addict cleaning lady.
Aunt Terka. Was swept
off her feet by him.
Eszter started to take her role
as a seducer too seriously.
But in the end. Alex turned her down
and ran off with the money.
Taking Timi with him.
The guys were left there. Scammed.
 One of their dreams did come true:
András won the lottery.
To the memory of lla Schütz
Eulalia! Can you forgive me?
Oh, Rodrigez, you have caused me
so much pain.
I know. I tore you away from your love,
I kidnapped your child,
I set your hacienda on fire,
and I wasn't even punished for all that
because I ran away
to Tasmania.
Darkness reigned in my heart, Rodrigez, but
now the sun will finally shine brightly.
Look! A rainbow!
The rainbow of forgiveness.
That's right. The good Lord
will forgive my sin.
- Eulalia, don't!
- Yes! Now you'll pay! You... You...
You dirty bastard Rodrigez.
This is the end of the series
as well as you, Rodrigez!
You can thank Teréz Tyokodi...
for your death!
- We've come to bid a final farewell...
- You can do it when you try.
... to our beloved sister. Terka.
But City of Stink won't be like this,
will it?
City of fucking Sin!
We are all sinners.
And the Lord says.
Delivered of earthly sin...
- Are we shooting on Monday?
- Ask Little Bro. He is the moneyman.
I hope it'll be a good movie.
All the lottery money's in it.
Don't worry.
Dead certain investment.

A KIND OF AMERICA 2
Hello, Bala.
Long time no see.
Sure.
Don't you want
to ask me how I'm doing?
- How are you doing, Bala?
- God awful, Alex, God awful.
You look well fed, though.
I hate it when I'm tricked.
When somebody promises something
only to scram in America.
To America.
And you know what happens
when I hate someone?
I was put into the can. I meant to call
you but I had to cool it for two years...
Last bits, Boss.
Must buy some more.
So you were put in the can, right?
I had a good laugh at that one.
So, as an exception,
you'll get another chance...
How do you say sunflower seed
in English?
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you...
Would you stop that?
You'll go crazy.
Where did I go wrong?
I simply don't understand.
It happens that something doesn't
come off the way you planned. Next time.
So you, too, think it's bad.
- I didn't say it was bad.
- Why not? Go ahead, say it.
One of the critics says
City of Sin is Hungary's
only weapon of mass destruction.
Compared to that
'bad' sounds like real praise.
I'd like you to move on at last.
To start something new.
That's what you, women are like!
You only fall for success.
I'd be happy if you Just brushed
your teeth for once.
Right. I'm off to work.
It's choir practice tonight, but
we could go see a movie afterwards.
Fine. City of Sin
is still playing in Csömör.
Who can that be?
Is that you?
- It's late. Come back tomorrow.
- Today is tomorrow.
It sure is. Coffee?
Make some for me, too, will you?
You should find someone
to replace Aunt Terka.
Have you seen my socks?
So, what's up?
I'm broke.
I have hardly a few pennies left of the lottery money.
I have no clue what I can do.
You shouldn't have promised
to finance City of Stink.
- Where's the bathroom?
- To your right.
Maybe we should have read
the screenplay.
Maybe we should have.
- Where's the bathroom?
- To your right.
- I have a distinct déJá vu feeling.
- They're twins. Where was I?
What should I do now?
János,
would you take over?
Tomi doesn't answer the phone.
Of course, Eszter, Just go.
How much money
have you got left?
Too little. I won't be able to pay
even for the apartment.
- Move out.
- I already have.
Really? And where to?
Now listen, you think,
Just because you're broke...
Bye now. We're off.
And don't fret about what happened
last night. It happens to anyone.
- You couldn't?
- Okay, you may stay.
But one more
word and you won't, either.
What's this?
The distributor returned
the copies he couldn't sell.
- I tried to call you a thousand times.
- Sssh!
- What are you doing?
- I'll throw them all out.
Only together with me.
It has nothing to do with Timi.
One Just needs a bit of a rest.
A few days
and anyone can get it.
Except for blond, squeaky,
nit-witted, thieving sluts!
How lucky you
cope with it so well.
I won't buy any DVDs.
I've seen it. It's shit.
Fuck you.
You bum.
What's this?
Eszter told me that either these will
disappear from her apartment or I will.
You want to bring them here?
Are you crazy? I left.
They Just came with me.
You broke up?
They break up, they patch up,
it's so boring.
She keeps nagging me
that I should go to work
and I also have the feeling that
she doesn't really like City of Sin.
You expect too much of a woman.
- Can I sleep here?
- No.
- Ákos can't get it up.
- Really? Because of Timi?
It has nothing to do with Timi.
There's more to life than screwing.
I can't think of anything right now
but I'm sure there's more.
I'll stay, then.
I'm back.
Tamás!
Tamás!
Don't get too comfortable.
If we don't get some work
now I'll lose the flat by the fall.
I can't work. I'm depressed.
- Yes?
- Well, then I'm depressed, too.
Great! Do you know what I am? I have a
10 million mortgage on the apartment
because somebody said that even though
it was a flop in the cinema
it will be a hit on DVD.
This place is dirty.
What's this?
A striptease bar in New York.
It was in the mail today.
They don't know, poor things,
that your interest is rather tepid.
Www.broadway.com/eastwest.
What the hell is that?
That's fucking Alex
I knew you'd turn up again
one day, you scum.
Producer Steve Garbarek
has announced that he is going to stage
the play East West.
Holy shit! He's got a brand new alias
and he lives like a lord!
What makes you think
that he is Garbarek?
There are three people
in that picture.
Go on.
Although the play was a flop
on Broadway earlier,
the producer from New York has already
announced his claim
for the rights
that will soon expire.
Gotcha. You scum.
A pity that he's on the other side
of the world.
I don't care. We go there and
beat our 60 mill out of him.
And we keep beating him
afterwards Just for fun.
And where will you get the money
for the tickets?
- You said you had a little money left.
- Right. With the emphasis on "little".
We won't run all the way to America
because of a postcard
sent from a New York
whorehouse. Forget it.
No drinks and no sticking notes into
the girls' pants. Got it?
Don't fret.
- Eszter would not believe this.
- Call her up.
The hell I will. She kicked me out.
I have my pride to think of.
Besides, she's switched off.
Timi! Timi!
Timi!
- Hey! Hey! You!
- I'll kill her. I'll kill her.
Who is Irina?
- Me.
- Timi?!?!
They only employ Russian girls.
Kto sivodnya atsustvuet?
Nikto ne atsustvuet.
He hasn't got a clue what it
means but he loves it.
Tantsevala repka smakom.
A petrushka spomidorom.
Are you sure this is okay?
Shouldn't we come back after closing?
At least like this he can't
touch me.
- So it was you who sent that card.
- How did you guess?
You used one of the club's.
- Aren't you smart!
- Where is Alex?
- How should I know?
- Listen, Mashenka,
if you think you can
fuck us again...
Listen, I want to take revenge, too,
okay?
He said I'd be a star, that he'd
help me get into a theatre
but he dropped me here
and took off.
Here you can show
everything you know.
Tell him to shut up or else
I won't say no more.
You don't know where Alex is.
That's a fact.
- But I know where he'll be
on the 1st. -  Where?
In some copyright thing.
There is a play, East West.
- He wants to buy the rights.
- Buy?
- I don't think he knows that word.
- He must.
There is this Hungarian Mafia man,
Bala something.
He's called that because he owns half of
Lake Balaton. Bala-ton. Bala. See?
Alex tricked him, too.
He talked him into staging a play,
then he drew the advance
and disappeared with it.
Surprise, surprise.
But this Bala is not such a loser
as you.
He came after Alex
and told him
that he'd shove his balls down his
throat if he didn't stage the show.
Since when have Mafia men
wanted to become producers?
Since thieving sluts've wanted
to become actresses.
What's up. Áki-baki?
Have you missed me so much?
And now what?
We go to that copyright place,
catch Alex and beat him up terribly.
I have a better idea. We buy the rights
of the play and offer to give it to him
if he gives us back our money.
- You think he'll give 60 mill for it?
- Wouldn't you? For your balls?
Especially, if they worked.
Hang on.
Did I understand it correctly that if he doesn't
stage the play the Mafia guy will do him in?
Seems like it.
How do you want
to buy the rights?
- How much money have you got left?
- I knew you would ask.
- Chill out. This is a dead certain
investment. -  Can we go?
With you? Where?
I'll show you that copyright office,
if you buy me an airplane ticket.
- I'd rather you swam.
- How about moving it a bit?
What happened?
Good place but you can only resign
if you die at the same time.
Dosvidania.
I Just borrowed that money, okay?
I would've paid you back out of my first fee.
And Tamás? Didn't you care
how he would make his film?
We heard András's stupid
lottery figures on the radio.
We knew you had won, so those couple of
mills wouldn't have counted anyways.
And the 2 unforgettable years we
spent together?...
- 4 unforgettable years!
- Don't try to change the subJect!
Simply, don't talk to me.
I didn't. I screamed.
I turned my eyes off the road only
to look for the clutch.
- But this one is automatic!
- So that's why I couldn't find it!
Shut up! Here he comes.
Surprise!
- Hello, boys! You here?
- We missed you. And we missed out 60 mill.
- Right. Let's talk about it.
-  Fine. But first we'll beat you up real bad.
You may not be able to talk afterwards
but when your fingers heal
...you can write us a letter.
- All right, chill out, man.
You should obey Tamás.
He knows what he is talking about.
By the way, I've seen City of Sin.
It's fantastic.
- I sent it to a few producers.
- You bastard!
Watch him. We're going in
for the rights.
This is it.
Your problem is you can't bear it
that I dumped you.
What I can't bear is
that you nicked my money.
What rights are the boys after?
Shut up or else
I'll put you in the trunk.
Do you think I don't know
where you got the money from?
Hard work.
I have long hands.
Not your hands
and not as long as you think.
It's not East West, is it?
One, I didn't cheat on you.
Two, I didn't get the money
from women.
- Three... how do you know?
- From Auntie Terka.
Auntie Terka? Damn...
...and I arranged
a VIP funeral for her.
Auntie Terka has died?
And you Just say that like this?
And didn't she tell you where she'd put
my shoes with the imitation diamonds?
- We've got the play. Where's Alex?
- Dumped him in here.
- You've bought the rights?
- We sure have, you bum.
And you will only get them
if you cough up our 60 mill.
- I won't.
- You will.
Otherwise that Bala guy
stuffs your balls down your throat.
But don't worry.
I'll smash them first for you.
I haven't got the sixty mill. I haven't got a penny.
That was what I tried to tell you.
- What do you mean you haven't got
a penny? - Ask her.
So what?
It wasn't my fault at all.
Damn it. God damn it!
You really don't have any money?
- Not a penny.
- Then it has to be plan B. B as in Bala.
- Don't. Wait.
-  What's up? Have you got some little nest egg after all?
- I have a suggestion.
- So do I. Kiss my ass.
Why don't you stage the play?
It has already been translated.
All you have to do is to direct it.
- The biggest flop in the history of
Broadway? - It may be a hit in Budapest.
On the opening day Bala gives
another 20 million.
Flop or no flop.
You can have that.
Guys, I think we should trust him.
Why not?
I'm in deep shit.
If you don't do it, Bala will do me in.
That's worth 20 million for me.
And where do we get the dough?
I haven't got any left
and Ákos can't get it up.
- He can't get it up? How cute.
- But I can.
You'll raise it. You're clever at that,
if I remember correctly.
- It stands like this when I want it.
- You Just don't praise us.
This hard.
Everyone will benefit from it.
You get 20 mill and I will stay alive.
- That's not good enough for us.
- Here's my phone number.
Think it over and let me know.
I suggest we do it. Here's the Job
we've been waiting for.
I agree. It would do you good
to do a bit of directing again.
This play is total shit.
You do it in two weeks,
we grab the 20 mill and that's it.
Provided Alex is telling the truth,
which hasn't happened often.
That's true.
I may not be able to direct
any more.
Maybe you never have.
- That's true.
- Fuck you.
- I say, Let's do it.
- I say, let's not do it.
- What is it? Why are you looking at me?
- We are out of a Job, becauseof your film.
That's true.
And no money
so you owe us that much.
And where shall I get a theatre?
I'll get you a terrific place.
You'll see.
Isn't it fantastic? And it's free.
The actors will be here at two.
Chill out. We'll only use it for rehearsals.
We'll rent a real theatre for the show.
Okay. May we have your attention,
please.
Hi! Thanks everyone for coming.
I'm Tamás Várnai, the director.
We're staging the play East West
which almost shocked America.
Before we start the casting, I have
some good news and some bad news.
Bad news is that your fee will be
minimal, paid from the revenues...
- How many are there left?
- Ten, twelve.
Then the good news is,
casting is over. You're all in.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Hi, everybody.
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to the rehearsal.
I mean, on this continent.
A real play at last!
Do you think I'll miss it?
- What am I playing?
- Nothing.
- But seriously.
- Seriously nothing.
Why are you such a bum,
because you can't get it up?
Sorry, Timi,
we're looking for people
with theatre experience.
- You want me to go, too?
- What have you done so far?
Porn. But they say
I'm good at lines, too.
We must check that out. Can you show us
something of your earlier works?
Come on, do you think she'll dig that
stupid bullshit?
I don't care. Is there a bed
or an operating table around here?
We'll find one.
Try to understand, Mother, freedom
awaits me abroad! A new life!
You cannot go! I forbid you.
I will report that boy to the police if necessary.
But I love him.
And don't you love your mother?
Don't you love your country?
Let me go, mother.
You'll have to let me go one day.
You mustn't defect!
I will never see you again!
You will. Maybe in a new, a better
and free world.
I am back in action.
- Bravo!
- She's a great talent.
Crisis meeting at the Old Man's tonight.
I told you I couldn't direct!
- You could have said it more loudly.
- I also said it was a shit of a play.
This Sigmond Mór is an idiot.
- Can I have some milk, please?
- You bum.
Trouble, little one?
- You look familiar.
- Congratulations on the little one!
What little one?
- Who is the father?
- Must we discuss it here?
I asked something.
Who's the father? Stop Joking.
What shall we do now?
I'll tell you.
We need a few naked women.
Guaranteed success.
They take off the commie raincoat, there's
nothing underneath and they sing.
-"Tear me apart, what are you waiting for?"
- You are a genius!
- Really? Shall I get some naked women?
- No, we need singers.
We'll make a musical!
I'm much better at that.
And it costs even more money.
What made West Side Story work
was the few good songs in it.
- But there's none in this one.
- András will write some.
What András? Me, András?
What do you mean, András?
The Communist girl and the revolutionary
boy fall in love with each other.
They sing a lot and then they'll die.
I'll rewrite it in a week.
- But where will be the naked women?
- Who told you I could write music?
- Don't we need some permission to rewrite it?
- We do. We'll call that Mór guy.
- Here's the number.
- You never listen to me.
- You want to call him? Now?
- Why not? It must be 4 pm in New York.
Even I don't dare to listen to myself.
It's ringing.
He is sitting in a bar, too.
I hear the same music.
That's a heavenly sign.
Besides,
a musical is not a bad idea.
The fucker.
Did he have the cheek
to turn up here again!
I don't understand.
Do you know Sigmond Mór?
This is Sigmond Mór,
alias Alex Brubeck,
alias Steve Garbarek,
alias bloody bastard.
It's swell to work together again,
isn't it?
Hey, what's going on here?
Stop!
Hang on,
aren't you the porn producers?
We are. We're preparing a new film.
You don't want to be in it?
You could be Little Moe Maggot.
What did I tell you would happen
if I saw your mugs here again?
I don't remember.
Neither do I.
There he is.
Stop. Stop.
I need to catch my breath.
You've busted my balls.
Leave my head for tomorrow.
A bird in the hand?
Is it really you
who wrote this shit of a play?
Hey, my whole youth is in it.
You should make the most of it
because you'll never grow old.
But why did you want to buy
your own rights from yourself?
I didn't.
I wanted you to buy them.
- What?
- I was in trouble.
Bala would kill me if there's
no show. But I didn't have a penny.
So I needed someone else
to do it for me.
But why us?
Is this some kind of conditioning you have
that you screw us every now and then?
The play was a terrible flop,
so nobody would've bought the rights
unless he wanted to screw me.
- And Timi helped you, right?
- No.
I Just told her what the situation was
and asked her not to tell you
- in case you had an idea to take revenge.
- God, how blond!
What do you mean Little Moe Maggot?
You fucking bastards.
Go!
You fucking bastards.
You shouldn't think
that everything's all right now.
I don't want you to love me
Just let me in on the business.
I may not have mentioned it before
but Bala will only pay
if he thinks that I am the producer.
I may not have mentioned it before
but I may tear your balls off.
You've mentioned it before.
But if you take me in, I'll give you
five million. Now. That's good business.
You said you didn't have a penny.
Yes, but some idiot paid 25 thousand
dollars for the rights.
Am I right in assuming
that we should do you a favor
so that you would give us backthe
money you conned out of us?
I said it was good business, not fair.
But if you don't want it...
See you at the rehearsal.
Here's your new lines.
The songs are being written now.
As soon as they are ready, you'll get them.
Hear, András? As soon as they are ready.
Good.
We'll start rehearsing and as soon
as the singing coach arrives...
She has arrived.
So the coach will help you
with the songs and...
What are you doing here?
You Just said
that I will help with the songs.
But you are a pharmacist!
But also a choir leader
and I know the scores.
Whose stupid idea was this?
Ákos's but you are right.
It was a bad idea.
I thought you'd thrown me out.
- Not you. City of Sin.
- That's the same thing.
- Don't underestimate yourself.
- What do you mean?
Hey, no hacking. Eszter,
thanks for coming. The floor is yours.
How could you call her?
Three reasons. She can sing, she was
free and would do it for nothing.
- But she has thrown me out!
- Stop whining. This is show business, bro.
Hello, sorry for being late.
Where are my lines?
Hey, what is she doing here?
She sings, she is free and she will do it for nothing.
This is show business, bro.
Chewing gum out and shut up.
Here we go.
What am I playing? I won't have
my lips botoxed for three sentences.
- You're not playing anything.
- Don't tell me.
I'm telling you.
- If she can be here, I can, too.
- As you wish. I'm off.
- Eszter stays, Timi goes.
- Timi stays, too.
- But Eszter goes.
- You're not going anywhere.
Why, you didn't want me
to be here in the first place.
I didn't want to break up
with you, still, you kicked me out.
I didn't kick you out.
- So, I'm asking for the last time,
what am I playing? - Nothing.
- Honestly, it boggles my mind.
- It won't make too much noise.
- I hate you.
- Shut up.
At last.
This is the place
where we rehearse, Bala.
We couldn't get anything else
for the time being,
but of course, we will rent
a theatre for the show.
What do you mean we?
You've done a lot, too, indeed.
This is Ákos Várnai. My co-producer.
- Your partner is the...
- This is Tamás Várnai, the director
and András
who is writing the songs.
And this is Timi, our starlet.
She had an important stage career
in New York. Right?
- And this is... er... er...
- Eszter Molnár...
Music coach and silly goose.
And this is Bala,
our generous supporter.
This is Vivi, my daughter.
She wants a part.
Goes without saying.
Boys we'll find something for her.
The main role.
Hang on for a sec. I am the director
and I won't give a part to someone...
Hello, welcome. Can you sing?
Never mind if you can't...
Mónika stays here to look after her.
Bye, love.
If you need something,
let Alex know.
Alex.
He is the boss here.
Fine. So here we go. Vivi,
here are the lines.
You said I was going to play Klára.
Easy come, easy go.
- You'll be Didó, her friend.
- I don't even know who she is.
- A whore.
- Oh... Okay.
- Shall I read this out?
- No, honey, fold it into an airplane...
I mean, read it out, please.
Mónika?
Mónika. Sándor Mónika.
You call me Mónika.
András Várnai.
You call me Irén.
Eszter! Eszter!
I Just wanted to thank you for your help.
It's very decent of you.
I agree. Anything else?
I know that I've been
quite stupid lately.
But it would be nice to talk
because I...
I've wanted to ask you something...
for a long time, in fact.
Yes?
But you should know that it'll kill me
if the answer is no.
Yes?
Do you really like City of Sin?
I don't believe this.
You bloody fool.
Things are working out well,
aren't they?
Sure, the play is shit, the actors are amateurs,
my girlfriend's Just left me again...
- Maybe I can help.
- Thanks, you've helped enough.
I'll get the Palace of Arts
for the opening.
Sure. Provided we collect
half the rental fee.
- Free of charge. Barter.
- Let's get drunk.
Problem is it's fake. You need
visual effects for a musical.
- Chill out. You'll have everything.
- We need dancers.
- Leave that to me. I'm back in form.
- Because of Timi?
This has nothing to do with Timi.
Listen, a man in the loo
offered me a part in a movie.
What's the title? Loo loo, you too?
Bum.
So... How many dancers do you need?
20? 30? A female orchestra?
No, but we need a choreographer.
What for? I'll do it.
True. A choreographer costs too much.
And we don't need one more...
We should talk.
Okay. I'll begin.
- Uhh!
- Ouch. Did you know it hurt so bad?
- That's why women prefer slapping.
- I see. Sorry.
So you are still mad at me.
That's a good sign.
Why should I be?
Because you lied?
Or because you stole
the boys' money?
Because I sent you away when
you wanted to come with me.
Go to hell.
If I had told you who I was
would you still have come with me?
- No. -  You're lying.
That's why I sent you away.
You should know.
You're an expert liar.
I had everything planned,
that's true.
Except you.
What a shitty line.
Is it from your play?
I Just wanted you to know.
Do you think
everything is fixed with a flower?
It's not bad for a start.
So we very badly need
a choreographer.
How much?
Not much.
- Oh-oh. -  But if it's a hit,
everything will be hunky-dory.
Hunky-dory?
Super-duper.
Hanky-panky.
I really don't understand how much
better she is than I am...
One whole size. At least.
If you like her tits so much
I can tell you where she bought them.
- Do you have a wife at home?
- What?
A wife. Who shouts when you come
home late and don't give you sex?
- No.
- Okay. I'll do it.
I love this.
Totally lame.
Attention!
Here are the new dancers,
Szilvi and Kitty.
- Ildi.
- I won't argue.
I'll bring another three tomorrow.
Bite off more than you can chew.
Or five.
I'll sacrifice my lunch break.
Try to be a bit more passionate when
you say, I don't know what to think.
And then you kiss. Action.
What's the matter?
- Shall I kiss him?
- Sure, why, what did you think?
Then kick him between the legs,
I don't give a shit.
- Go on, do it.
-  What for? I can do it. I have a sense of the absolute pitch.
- And you have absolutely no voice to speak of.
-  Enough. I refuse to rehearse with her.
Shut up. Eszter dictates,
Timi does it.
You're puffed up because
you're the director's girl.
After the City of Sin not many
people envied me.
Eszter!
Sorry. I have to go to work anyway.
- Timi, this is the key role.
- A small key.
You're the narrator. The whole play begins with you.
This song has to be a hit.
- We need a choir.
- Can you work together or not?
From now on we'll rehearse
at my place. Every afternoon.
City of Sin?
Yes. My movie.
You have a movie?
Must be very sexy.
Well, yes, you may say so.
I have a DVD on me by accident.
Lilike, my bag, please.
I have a DVD on me by accident.
Girls, come let's do the whores.
Listen.
I've rewritten one of my songs a bit.
Okay.
Don't you want to hear it?
No. I'm sure it's fabulous.
- This is really good.
Have you studied music? - A bit.
I used to have a guitar teacher.
He was old but he was a good guy.
- I miss him.
- Is he dead?
No, he is in Jail.
Armed robbery.
You could help me.
- We could really do with a pro.
- Aren't you one?
- Not at all.
- What are you then?
I was a millionaire last.
But it's over now.
- Do you really
want to become an actress? - No,
I Just wanted to upset my Dad.
I'm sorry he passed me on to you.
I know I'm a cow.
Perhaps you should listen
to Tamás more.
You think so?
He's something like a director,
you see.
The actors usually do
what the director tells them.
My father always tells me
not to obey others.
Except when an AK-47 is aimed at me.
Surprise.
- I managed to shake Mónika off for a while.
- My father will kill meif he finds out.
You don't mean that literally,
do you?
No. He would never hurt me.
Just you.
We won't be allowed backstage.
- Hello, Mózes.
- Alex, old pal,
long time no see. Come.
- Hello, boys.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- What's up?
He's the guy I told you about.
András Várnai.
Alex sent me over your lyrics.
Quite good. We'll spruce up the music.
Seriously?
2 minutes, guys.
We need something like that
for the warden's song.
Bye.
See you in the cemetery.
I wanted to play the bass guitar
when I was little.
Cool guys.
They have a trash metal band.
- What's this you are wearing?
- We swapped. Cool, isn't it?
Shall we go somewhere else?
- What's up?
- András!
I'm wanted by the police
and I don't think Bala would be happy,
either, if Vivi was taken to the station.
Leave it to me.
Long live the force.
Move, damn it.
You are under arrest.
Do you want to write a report
all night because of a drunken idiot?
When I was young I wanted to be
a policeman.
A real idiot.
Go home and
have a good night's rest.
Damn it!
So what does
"fuck the police" mean?
To Europe.
Isn't it time for you to learn English?
You'd better show some respect.
We've already translated half of it
so you have no reason to sneer.
Switch it off.
What's going on here?
I'm working, sweetheart.
Why aren't you sleeping?
- I was learning my lines.
- Ssss!
Go to bed. It's rather late.
- Hello.
- Hi, Vivi.
Hi. Good evening.
You know how I hate it
when you bring work home.
I'm almost finished with it.
Dad...
Dad, tell Mónika to get off my back.
He's there to protect you.
Actors are a bad lot.
I know. But it would be nice to do
what the director says, sometimes.
I don't like this theatre thing.
You should choose
a proper profession.
- Like a policewoman?
- Watch your tongue.
Come on, Daddy.
Now that you have dumped me
on them, I'd like to do it right.
You're an exact copy of your mother.
That's why I can
never say no to you.
- Can I have my belly button pierced?
- No!
Will you talk to Mónika then, at least?
Okay. But you promise
to go to university in the fall.
I must go now.
Sweet dreams, sweetheart.
Thank you. It was quite good.
Vivi. Ádám.
Let's take it from the kiss.
- From mine?
- If possible. Mónika?
- Go ahead.
- Honestly?
- You don't mind? You are not armed?
- You are the boss.
Then let's take it from the kiss.
Vivi!
You must come with me!
Trust me!
I really don't know
what to think any more.
What was that?
I said, kiss him.
- What was that? I want to see a proper kiss.
-  Wasn't it proper?
No, no, honey. This is proper.
Just for you to know
what you're missing.
- Where are you going?
- I'll go get a female platoon
or company, one or the other.
Look, I've brought another version
of the warden's song.
- Not bad, what is it?
- Tankcsapda.
They told me to tell you
you may use it.
- Try it, Béla.
- Okay.
No, it's slightly false.
Let's do it from the top.
Never mind.
Once more please.
No, listen.
After "d" you Jump to "e".
Go.
That's it. Fabulous.
Did you attend the Music Academy?
Prison choir. 1994-1997.
Great.
Would you help us out?
We should try to beat the song
into Béla.
I mean,
you could practice with him.
- Can I look at the music?
- Sure.
This is it. How do you like it?
- When can we rehearse?
- Unfortunately, only a few days before the opening night.
It's hard for me to say it,
but thanks.
Go, look around.
Incredible. A genuine theatre.
- Mónika!
- Yeah?
Have you ever sung
on a stage as big as this one?
Over here.
Acoustics are much better here.
Hey, what are you doing? Wait!
Vivi! Vivi!
- Pull me up! Pull me up!
- Coming.
This is so boring! I need the stage
and the bustling.
Okay. Go bustle.
I won't bore you any longer.
- What's the matter again?
- Nothing. I've Just had enough.
I goof off on the Job
Just to play for you.
I can't sleep because
I spend half the night rehearsing.
And what do I get in return?
Everybody takes me for a fool,
you pull faces and Tamás
doesn't even look at me.
Are you together
or aren't you now?
Frankly? I have no idea.
I thought he'd understand that I'm
doing the whole thing for his sake,
but he's either a stupid idiot,
or he's too busy gaping at Cinthia.
I can understand that.
- She's not such a hot number.
- You crazy? She's totally hot.
I hate her.
A guy might also notice
if you have some brains.
Sure, if you inJect it into your tits.
You know what? I don't care.
If you didn't dress like a
retired chemistry teacher
you'd turn Tomi on.
- Do you really think
it would make a difference? - Sure.
Although who the fuck understands guys?
I'm sexy, my clothes are hot,
you could crack nuts on my butt still Ákos
chased after every other girl on the globe.
Do you understand
what the matter is with me?
- In my opinion you are great
as you are. -  Aren't I?
Damn you!
- And now, where to?
- Away from here,
- this place gives me the creeps.
- Why?
I'm not enough for this.
- I can't even kiss properly.
- That's rather strange, indeed.
I had no one to practice with.
Come on.
There was this boy once who tried to kiss
me, but Dad set his bicycle on fire.
It was in kindergarten.
Do you mean,
you haven't even??
After all that, how many do you think
wanted to experiment with me?
I got no bicycle.
How about life insurance?
How about
Just rehearsing the scene?
- You mean the kiss?
- Mónika said, you were allowed.
- That wasn't so bad.
- It's not perfect yet, though.
- Where has everybody gone?
- I don't miss any of them.
- Last night I watched City of Sin.
- Really? And?
I loved it. It must be a great hit.
Yes, it stirred up some reaction.
The part where the man
and the woman
are sitting facing each other
Just looking for a long time
and nothing happens,
that's very erotic.
Where he tells her
that his father has died?
I'm not sure. I fell asleep,
they sat there so long but it was as
if I were sleeping with you.
Cute.
I didn't know you had
some better pieces, too.
- You gave it to me for Christmas.
- That explains it.
It's pretty, but somehow
it doesn't look like me.
But that's the point, isn't it?
Now go. They are supposed to be
in the Palace of Arts.
- Thanks for the extra tuition.
- Any time.
- What's up?
- Nothing.
And when the man says
"This is a place of sin, a city of sin"
does he have
eroticism on his mind?
Rather the pointlessness of existence,
of everything becoming empty.
He doesn't think of eroticism?
Oh yes. That. Too.
Eszter, what are you??
- What's up?
- Nothing.
Right. So let's do the whores'
and policemen's dance.
Where's Eszter?
- Will you watch me?
- Sure.
You know
what's happening tonight?
Will I lose my virginity?
I hope so.
And if I screw up?
And cut. Thank you.
How did you like it?
There won't be any problems.
It went quite well.
Tell Eszter to...
Where's Eszter?
- Mr. Bala, are you satisfied?
- Who's that?
Why do you ask?
If he touches my daughter again, I'll cut
his throat and kill his whole family, too.
I don't know him.
Vivi!
We're off.
Dad! Dad!
We either castrate our little brother,
or move to Chile.
Haven't you seen Eszter?
It's strange that she hasn't shown.
Why? Alex isn't here, either,
thank God.
What is it?
What is what?
You didn't come to rehearsal.
But I was there last night
in the Palace of Arts.
And?
And.
We broke up, after all.
Yes, I've realized that myself.
There was nothing.
It's Just that everybody messed
with me so much
and Cinthia was nice,
she had faith in me.
Can you quote something
from City of Sin?
Sure.
The best part.
The end.
Are you wrapped?
- Is something wrong?
- Matter? No, why?
I Just wanted to talk to you about...
How about coming to my place
and talking about it until morning?
No, you don't want to talk to me.
Cinthia. You are a special girl.
Really.
There are hardly more than two people who
like City of Sin and you are one of them.
And you look really hot and I'm
an idiot to miss the opportunity.
Wait, slow down,
I don't understand a word.
I love Eszter.
I've understood that.
A bit of sex with me before you
go back to love Eszter?
Stop tormenting me, will you?
I'm an idiot. I Just wanted
to say I was sorry.
Couldn't I come in to talk it over?
Please!
Sure. Come in.
Victor!
Fuck you Victor!
It's about time you introduced me
to your parents.
I wanted to talk to you.
- I saw the rehearsal, Alex. It's quite good.
- I'll tell the boys. They'll be glad.
But I'm not glad.
You said it would be a flop.
I give you twenty mill, you give me
a receipt for eighty, the play is a flop
and disappears forever and no one will
ever know how much money was in it.
- That was a good plan.
- But it won' be a flop!
I don't know what this silly musical
is about but it works!
I took Vivi there because I thought
a flop would discourage her
from playing theatre.
I want my flop, Alex. The flop you promised me.
The flop I'm paying for.
It may straighten out itself.
As far as I know,
the director has problems.
- What problems?
- Heart.
Big deal, who hasn't?
My cholesterol is eight.
- Nine.
- It's ten.
Do something about that play
or else I'll tear off your balls
and shove them up your ass so
from then on you'll use them to blink.
What are you doing?
I thought I'd find a place where
I can throw up
but there's
such a terrible mess here.
Go to bed.
You'll have a rehearsal tomorrow.
- No rehearsal.
- No rehearsal?
I'm not making a show for that sly
and shifty bastard.
Alex?
Eszter is with him.
There's a girl upstairs. Do you
want her? To forget your troubles.
Idiot.
That's an exaggeration. She's not
very clever but it suits her all right.
Leave me alone.
- There's such a mess here.
- Find a cleaning woman.
Sorry, honey, I Just had to
straighten out my little brother.
I wish I had simply
killed him instead.
- You have a visitor.
- Vivi, it's me.
- What's this on you?
- Disguise.
Very discreet.
Won't you come down?
I'm not allowed to leave my room.
Daddy will only let me out for the premiere.
Then I'll...
There'll be no premiere anyway.
What do you mean?
What are you doing here?
I'm the sentry. I'm supposed to kill
whoever tries to climb up.
Why will there be no premiere?
Eszter got off with Alex. Tamás hasn't
done anything but cleaning for three days.
- What will happen now?
- I haven't got a clue.
- Can I see you though?
- Dad forbade me.
Couldn't you perhaps?
You'd better scram, pal.
You?
I'm waiting. There might be
a rehearsal after all...
This is the first time in your life that
you've been on time. Totally in vain.
This is so unfair.
I got a part at last.
I even learned my lines.
If you had paid me, I would've had
my tits fixed, too.
And then this.
What's wrong with your tits?
Too small.
Depends for who.
I would've been good.
I feel the character so much,
I can totally identify with her.
With the prostitute
who has syphilis?
But she also has a heart.
Never mind.
We'll see what happens.
Bye.
Action.
I'm Irén Borsodi,
75 years old, a widow.
Single.
I enJoy hiking.
Sorry.
With the head only?
With my whole body.
Profile.
- Aunt Ani.
- Budapest.
53, unfortunately.
You'd like to clear up your feelings
inside you, but childhood desires
well up in you.
Action.
Fine. Thank you.
So far so good.
Hey, what are you doing?
I said, the rubbish.
Is that rubbish for you?
No, I haven't seen it.
I haven't seen it,
but I would like to.
City of Sin?
I'm from Ózd.
No.
No.
Unfortunately.
No, yes.
My sister may have,
This is a sinful place.
A city of sin.
Well, ladies?
What's your opinion?
Thank you.
You'll be informed of the result.
- Good bye.
- Thank you.
- Good bye.
- Good bye.
- Good bye.
- Bye, bye.
What are you doing?
I wanted to give them DVDs.
Enough of this nonsense.
Go back and rehearse.
No! I told you I'm not doing
a show for Alex.
And take off your shoes.
We've Just vacuumed the place.
This is my apartment.
The table will get dirty.
My table.
My armchair.
My sofa.
- Congratulations.
- And this? I'll help you. Your bag.
And what is this? Your damned film.
The same. The same.
And what's this?
Your t-shirt.
And what's this? Your pants.
And this? Your belt.
- What are you actually doing?
- I'm actually throwing you out.
- You are a wonderful brother.
- You need a doctor, not a brother.
You are driving me mad with your
movies, your plays, your cleanliness,
but most of all
with your constant whining.
Did you hear that?
He's right.
Don't you understand that I cannot direct!
And I don't want to, either.
I don't give a shit about
what you want or don't want.
Just once in your life try to consider
other people not Just yourself.
Do it for me, or...
for Ákos!
Or for any of the stupid actors!
That's right. Do it for Timi!
Or for Eszter. She's been sweating
her guts out for you all day!
Except later she ditched me
for that cheating bastard!
The hell she did! You ditched her.
But the fucking idiot you are,
you didn't even notice!
Cut.
Don't worry.
We'll solve it.
Yes? Can you direct?
Sure. No big deal, you Just need
a bit of confidence and charisma...
Hey, when I stand on the mark
at the second chorus,
shall I react immediately
or hold it for a bit?
And a dictionary for me to understand
what they are on about.
Come on, kids,
let's not fall apart.
Eszter Molnár... Eszter Molnár...
She is in a meeting right now.
- Can I take a message?
- No, thank you. Or rather,
please tell her I've been trying to
reach her. And that I must talk to her.
Tell her that I've been a complete idiot.
She had every right to bolt with Alex.
I don't even deserve her
to forgive me.
However, if it should have not come off for
some reason then don't tell that to her
because I'd like her
to give me another chance.
Surprise.
- Have you been let out?
- I escaped.
Daddy had some colleagues
visiting from Chechnya.
- Move a little...
- Is the show happening?
I wouldn't bet on it.
Okay. Right.
Jump up and down.
But the gist of it is,
I love her very much anyway.
I know it wasn't quite apparent
because film and theatre
was always more important
with the rest of the
self fulfillment bullshit.
I think there's nothing interesting
about me, apart from Eszter.
No, wait, don't tell her that
She may realize that I'm right
and she won't call me back.
Just tell her to forgive me.
Or rather...
...that she should call me back.
Eszter!
It's yours.
What's going on? I thought Tamás
called off the show.
Ask the new director.
Okay, everyone. You grab your stuff
and carry it to the truck.
We're off to the Palace of Arts.
There we can rehearse one more time.
Hold it, guys.
There's a bit of a problem.
I hope you're suffering
from a deadly disease.
- The theatre is gone. No more Palace of Arts.
-  You said you took care of it...
I had but then you called off
the performance.
So they rented it out
to someone else.
God damn it.
I'm very sorry.
Hello? Administration, please.
Is that you my dear?
Great. It's Alex.
I wish to cancel a booking.
Okay.
I think this is the perfect moment
for us to get really and utterly drunk.
You're not going anywhere. We'll rehearse.
There'll be a performance on Wednesday.
- Would you tell me where?
- Here.
Here?
Industrial quarters in the 1970s.
Here you are.
We are here. All our stuff is here,
what else do you need?
- You can't do it here.
- Just you watch.
We promised a real theatre to Bala.
He may not want to pay for this.
- I don't give a shit.
- Slow down with that shit.
We're happy you're back on you feet, but
if there's no money, what's the point?
You. And them. Remember?
You said so.
Yes. But mainly because of
the twenty mill.
No, you were right. We wasted
too much time for me to let it go.
Come on.
I told you: Rehearsal!
At least he is enthusiastic.
That's what finishes us off, usually.
I need them back Sunday by noon,
otherwise we'll have a standing event.
- No problem. Thanks for coming.
- Sure.
And here comes the competition.
If you know the answer you'll win two tickets
to the musical East West
which has a new venue.
The Budafok Champagne Factory.
 Tamás Várnai. The director is here
with us. Hello. Tamás.
My first question is...
Go and get ready.
We'll start soon.
Call Timi. I'd like to see
the beginning once more.
- Are you sure you want it now?
- We must.
What if Dad kills you
after the show?
Timi, Tamás wants
to rehearse the beginning.
Right. As we agreed.
Go get the money
and give it to Alex.
Alex!
Give it to him.
Vivi! Open it.
I know you are in there.
Vivi! Open it now!
Can't you hear me?
Okay, you asked for it.
What is it Daddy?
What do you want?
- Where is he? Where is he?
- Where is who?
- Inside the monkey, is he?
- In the monkey?
You think there's somebody
inside that monkey?
See?
- Gee, the Mafia Daddy.
- Hello.
- Come with me, I'll show you the best place.
- As soon as this is over, we're off.
Do you have a wife at home
who doesn't want to give you sex?
Sorry.
Are you all right?
Timi, do your utmost. We have no
proper amplification
so you have to fill the whole
space with your voice.
One more time.
- What's that?
- Eszter's choir.
Good evening, Tamás.
Eszter said you'd need a little help.
She taught the kids the songs,
you Just tell us where to come in.
Is she here, too?
No. She said she was busy.
So you are packing again.
But this time I have two tickets.
The Orient Express.
Destination: Venice.
Are you so sure
that I'm going with you?
What's against it?
What's in favour of it?
Your suitcase...
What shall I do with a conman?
At least I know what I want.
And whom.
You were right. I lied to you.
If you had asked me,
I would have gone with you.
I knew it.
But I would have regretted it.
I can't help it.
I fall in love with idiots.
And with conmen?
And with conmen.
But I prefer idiots.
Sorry.
So am I.
- A certain Viktor is here to see you.
- Tell him, to come on up.
I have something to take care of.
- I see. I'm off.
- Shall I see you?
I want to see the show.
I have some presents in there
for the premiere.
- Well, then. Good-bye.
- Bye.
Eszter!
Tell Tamás...
to be careful
with the scaffolding in the back.
- With what?
- Just tell them.
There's nothing wrong with it...
Did you get my message?
Of course, there isn't.
Just another trick of his.
I did.
My hands are still sticky.
Otherwise why would he have
warned us?
Timi! Timi!!
I'm all right! I'm fine.
I can play.
Eight million,
eight million ten, twenty, thirty...
It's all there.
- Or don't you trust Bala?
- Of course I do.
I'm doing the whole thing for you.
What if you've brought more by accident?
- What's in that one?
- My stuff.
- I'm going to Venice.
- Venice?
Venice is a cool place.
There's a film festival there.
- What's it called again?
- The Venice Film Festival.
That's right.
I dig the flicks.
Guys!
I'm not going to the hospital.
Do you hear? Don't touch me!
- But you have a broken leg, miss.
- Never mind, give me some painkiller.
Take her.
- I'll go out and send them home.
- No, no, no!
What else can I do?
It starts with Timi's solo.
Eszter knows the song, too.
- Very funny.
- You helped her learn it, didn't you?
Okay, now listen.
I am a pharmacologist.
Eszter can dance, too.
Eszter can kill, too.
No, leave her. I can't ask her to do it.
Let alone myself.
I hate you!
God,
I was terrible, wasn't I?
- I love you.
- The right answer. Thank you.
But I won't always dress up like
a whore to make you remember you do.
I'll go see what the dancers
are doing.
I told you.
Tamás is a genius.
My genius.
You were great. You were great.
You were clumsy.
You were great. You were great.
Bravo!
- Have you seen Daddy? How does he
like it? - He hasn't shot anyone yet.
Go get dressed.
Nineteen million nine hundred
and ten twenty, thirty...
and it's all here.
Victor, thanks.
It was a pleasure
working with you.
I wrote a play once, too.
Except that one was good.
Not like yours.
That's very kind of you.
Brutal, but very kind.
It was about a bodyguard
who screws the boss's girlfriend.
And his daughter.
And his mother.
- She's quite good.
- Think of all the effort I put into it.
Yeah. Same here.
The truck leaves tomorrow.
You must come with me.
Trust me.
I don't know
about trust anymore.
Go, get her off.
- How?
- I don't care. Go.
I'll call Victor and tell him
not to give Alex the money.
Trust my love for you.
I love you. Too.
Then you have to choose.
How can I choose between
my love and my father?
Choose freedom, then.
Is it that easy
to leave your country?
My country has left me.
I have my roots here.
Those roots Just pull you back.
- He took my part!
- Thank God!
I mean, I'll talk to him.
Then he does the boss in.
I see. Very original.
Listen, if you're out of a Job,
make sure not to call me.
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a train to catch.
Is he out of his mind?
Sorry, sorry.
He was great.
The boss Just called.
Your plan's fallen through.
Success?
I don't know.
But he wants his money back.
How about splitting?
Fifty-fifty?
- With twenty million it means seven for you.
-  Give me the bag.
Open it.
How smart...
- Who said you didn't have any brains?
- You did.
It was a mistake.
Don't fret, Alex.
Go eat some...
..."fuck-you" instead.
Get lost.
Hey, little bro.
Have I praised your music yet?
No.
Well, one day, perhaps.
Hey, watch out.
Let it rain.
That's my daughter.
The one that's been shot.
She was great. Really great.
Oh, no. Is it over?
See, if that guy didn't Jump the queue
in the hospital, we could have made it.
- He had an axe sticking out of his head.
- They can always find some excuse.
- Who played me?
- I did. But it sucked.
I do hope so.
You'll play it next time.
Next time?
Some guy was here who said
he'd take the show on tour.
V v!
How did you like it?
It wasn't bad.
But you dying up there...
- Haven't you ever seen anyone shot dead?
- Don't worry. I won't be acting anyway...
- Thank god.
- András and I will form a band.
- What? - And I'm sleeping at his place
tonight if there's a way...
Before you say something, boss,
Vivi is not a minor any more.
Shut up, Pop Idol!
Also, she holds title to all your dough
you've been hiding from the cops.
All right. I don't mind.
Talking about money.
I know this is not a proper theatre.
But wouldn't it be still possible
for us to get the 20 million?
Sure it would. Who do you
take me for? We agreed.
- And when can we get the money?
- I've given to Alex it. To Alex...
- Oh, no!
- And where is Alex?
On his way to Venice, I'm afraid.
The damned fucking bastard.
But since he didn't fulfil
his side of the agreement
I took it back from him.
What's this? What's this?
- What the fuck is this?
- He must have swapped the bags.
Oh, you Jackass.
Didn't I tell you he was a fraud?
And what about the boys?
- Will you pay their share, or...
- I'll pay them, don't worry.
And I'll get this from Alex back.
Back from Alex.
I can hardly wait.
Mónika, Viktor, we're off.
- Where to, boss? - What do you mean
where to? To Venice.
Come on, Victor.
What a great movie!
"This is a sinful place,
a city of sin."
It made me shiver.
That's unbelievable...
That you have
more than zero fans?
No, that Alex has fooled us again.
- Speak of the devil.
- May I congratulate you?
Drop dead.
You've stolen our money again.
That's Just compensation.
She's all yours.
She's worth much more,
believe me.
You know what? You're right.
I don't give a shit about the money.
Besides, Bala is on his way to Venice
to make you cough up his money.
Well, I'll try my best to dodge him.
By the way, a few moments ago
I had a call from Ron Richards,
one of the biggest independent
Hollywood producers.
I sent City of Sin to him.
He loved it.
He wants you as director.
Sure, Alex. I'm sure that's true.
What you say is gospel to me.
I Just wanted to alert you.
I've given your number to him.
He said he'd call you right now.
You know what? Forget my number.
Once and for all.
What did he want?
He said some producer would call me
to direct something in America.
- It must be stinking.
- Right. Disgusting.
So?
- Shall we Jump?
- Sure.
What shall we do now?
Chill out. The boys will be here, soon.
What boys?
The boys from Allianz.
And what do they want from you?
They issued all my insurance policies.
I even trusted them with my money.
Rolling!
- Are you on the NET?
- Yeah. Mobile. Pretty fast.
Visiting porn sites, are you?
I've never visited
any porn sites in my life.
We'll visit them tomorrow.
Right turn in fifty yards.
- Hey, does this work at home, too?
- Sure.
You can upload the map of any country.
Right turn ahead.
- That's fantastic.
- Take it. It's yours.
- How come?
- It's a prop. We must give it back.
Rolling.
- Did you play 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?
- Why do you want to know?
Just because the Jackpot is
2 billion Forints.
How much!?
Sorry, sweetheart, I Just had
to straighten out my little bro.
Worse than a Hoover?
- I'll be right back. Set it up.
- Are you crazy? It's live.
This is T-Home TV.
We'll continue when I get back.
Look, this one has
a video collection too.
Really?
Have they got the City of Sin?
