WOMAN: Still living with a woman?
Yes, still a lesbian.
Still on the farm.
She thinks it's safe there.
Nowhere's safe.
Too many people with nothing to do
but cause trouble.
How's work?
They look through me
when I speak, forget my name.
There's no respect anymore.
Have you missed me?
I miss you all the time.
(MOANING)
I'm curious.
How do you manage this life?
Is there a husband?
You better go now.
I forgot to tell you,
my mother's ill.
I have to take care of her,
so I won't be here next week.
Will I see you the Thursday after?
I'm not sure.
Why don't you ring the agency?
Give me your number.
I'll ring you direct.
No. Ring the agency.
"That had usurped upon a living
thought that never more could be."
Why did Wordsworth use
the unusual verb form 'usurp upon'?
Because 'usurp upon' means
to intrude or encroach upon.
"The clouds cleared, the peak was
unveiled, and we grieved to see it."
Why 'grieve'?

What is the reason for taking
a course in Romantic poetry?
It's mainly for the atmosphere.
Are you enjoying the course?
I'm not that crazy about Wordsworth.
Wordsworth has been
one of my masters.
Maybe he'll grow on me.
Maybe.
But in my experience, poetry speaks
to you at first sight or not at all.

Didn't he die young?
They all die young
or dry up or... go mad.
I must go.
Stay longer.
Why?
Because you ought to.
Why ought I?
Why?
Because a woman's beauty
does not belong to her alone,
it's part of the bounty
she brings into the world.
She has a duty to share it.
What if I already share it?
Then you should share it more widely.
I must leave.

No.

As we saw last week,
notoriety and scandal affected
not only Byron's life
but also the way his poems
were received by the public.
(WOMAN WHISPERING)
(READS) "At times resign his own
for others' good
"But not in pity
"Not because he ought
"But in some strange perversity

"That swayed him onward
with a secret pride
"To do what a few

"And this same impulse would
in tempting time
"Mislead his spirit
equally to crime."
So...
What kind of creature is this Lucifer?
MAN: He does what he feels like.
Doesn't care if it's good or bad,
he just does it.
(GIGGLING)
Exactly.
Good or bad, he just does it.
He doesn't act on principles
but on impulse,
and the source of his impulses
is dark to him.
Read a few lines further.
"His madness was not of the head
but heart..."
A mad heart.
What is a mad heart?
Never mind.
Note that we are not asked to
condemn this being with a mad heart.
On the contrary,
we are invited to sympathise.
For though he lives among us,
he is not one of us.
He is what he calls himself, a 'thing',
that is, a monster.
Not possible to love...
...and condemned to solitude.

I can't.

MAN: Where can I find Professor Lurie?
Here I am.
Professor, what you have done
is not right.
You should be ashamed of yourself!
We never thought we were sending
our daughter into a nest of vipers!
Won't you come to my office?
So help me God if I have
the wrong end of the stick,
but I don't think so.
I can see it from your face.
Excuse me,
I have business to attend to.
Professor Lurie! Professor Lurie!
You can't run away!
You haven't heard
the last of it yet!
I was thinking of seeing Lucy
after the inquiry.
Of course I haven't told her.
Well, let me tell you,
everyone already knows
about this latest affair of yours
in the juiciest detail.
Really?
The story is she took sleeping pills.
Come on, David,
we shared a bed for 10 years.
Why should you have secrets?
Was she in love with you?
No, Rosalind, I'm afraid
it wasn't that dramatic.
(SIGHS)
What an inglorious end
to a brilliant career.
What if you lose your pension?
They can't cut me off without a penny.
You haven't asked me
whether I was in love with her.
For God's sake, David, you're 52!
Will you be able to resume your post?
I'm not sure I want to.
The whole thing is disgusting.
Disgusting and vulgar.
And I don't mind saying so.
(DOOR SLAMS)
(APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS)
David, is there any member
of the committee
whose participation you feel
might be prejudicial to you?
Not in a legal sense.
Let me remind everyone
this is not a trial but an inquiry.
Now, the first complaint
comes from Miss Melanie Isaacs.
You all have a copy
of her statement?
Yes.
Yes.
Will Miss Isaacs
be appearing in person?
Miss Isaacs appeared
before the committee yesterday.
Now, if we could push on.
The second and related charge
comes from the Registrar.
(READS) "The record shows
a mark of 70%
"for a mid-term test
which she did not sit."
I'm sure this committee
have better things to do
than rehash a story
over which there's no dispute.
I plead guilty to both charges.
Pass sentence
and let us get on with our lives.
Professor Lurie, we are here
to listen to both sides.
Perhaps it would be better
if you were represented
by someone who is more familiar
with our procedure?
Why? I can represent myself
perfectly well.
Despite the plea I've entered,
must we continue with this hearing?
We want to give you a chance
to state your position.
I've stated my position.
I'm guilty.
Guilty of what?
Of all I'm charged with.
You are taking us in circles.
Have you read Miss Isaacs' statement?
No, but I'm sure it's all true.
Would it not be prudent
to actually read her statement?
No.
There are more important things
in life than being prudent.
Have you consulted anyone?
A priest, for instance,
or a counsellor?
Would you be prepared
to undergo counselling?
No. I'm beyond counselling.
I've made my plea.
Is there any form
of public statement
you would be prepared
to subscribe to?
What do you want
the statement to contain?
An admission that you were wrong.
I've admitted that. I'm guilty.
There's a difference
between pleading guilty
and admitting you were wrong.
And that would satisfy you?
An admission I was wrong?
No. First, Professor Lurie
must make his statement.
Then we can decide
if we can accept it.
See if it comes from the heart.
From the words I use, you can see
if it comes from the heart?
Very well.
I took advantage of my position.
It was wrong...
...and I regret it.
The question is, does it reflect
your sincere feelings?
That's enough.
Let's play it by the book.
I plead guilty.
I'd become a servant of Eros.
WOMAN: That's him! Here he comes!
Professor Lurie!
Excuse me, Professor,
can we talk to you for a minute?
What about?
You know, the hearing.
I can't comment on that.
Are you sorry?
No.
I was enriched by the experience.
He was what by the experience?
WOMAN: He was enriched.

You didn't tell me you broke up.
Aren't you nervous on your own?
I've got the dogs.
And I've started a boarding kennel.
Anyway, if there's a break-in,
I don't see how two people
are better than one.
Very philosophical.
And I have a rifle.
It's never been used,

But here it is alright, I think.
Thanks.
Petrus helps me out.
He's also co-proprietor.
Since when?
Does he live on the property?
I've put electricity in the old stable.
He stays there.
What would you like to do first?
Would you like a cup of tea
or a show-off around the farm?
Show me what you've been up to.
Rosalind rang me,
filled me in with the details.
What happened with the hearing?
They wanted me to go through
some kind of public repentance.
I'd prefer to be put up
against a wall and shot.
So you left the university?
I was asked to resign.
Oh, dear.
Will you miss teaching?
Ah, my daughter, the one who comes to
teach learns the keenest of lessons.
Those who come to learn,
learn nothing.
Well, we start at 5:00

What's the story with Petrus?
Can he just come in here

We have an understanding.
He got a Land Affairs grant
earlier this year,
enough to buy a hectare
and a bit from me.
We share the dam, and everything
from there to the fence is his.
If he gets a second grant,
he'll build a house
and move out of the stable.
He's very busy.
You should give him a hand.
Give Petrus a hand? I like that.
I like the historical piquancy.
And will he pay me?
I'm sure he will.
Why don't you ask him?
And what can I do for you
while I'm here?
You can help me with the dogs,
you can help Bev at the clinic.
You mean Bev? Help Bev?
I don't think Bev and I will hit it off.
Don't expect to get paid.
You'll have to do it
out of the goodness of your heart.
Hmm, I don't know, Lucy,
these animal welfare people
are a bit like Christians.
Everyone is so cheerful

Hold public collections, donations.
We get a grant
for putting the dogs down.

Dr Oosthuizen, our vet.
But there are too many of them.
So I help out,

(SIGHS)
Come on, Juzzi.
When you were small,
our next door neighbour had a dog,
a golden retriever, remember?
Dimly.
It was a male.
And whenever a bitch went past,
it got excited, unmanageable.
And with Pavlovian regularity
its owner would beat it,
so that at the mere smell of a bitch
the dog would run around the garden
with its ears flat
and its tail between its legs,
whining and trying to hide.
I don't see the point.
Well, you can punish a dog
for chewing a slipper,
the dog can accept that.
But desire is another story.
Is that the moral?
Males must be allowed to follow
their instincts unchecked?
No, that's not the moral.
What was ignoble about the spectacle
was that the poor dog had begun
to hate its own nature.
It no longer needed to be beaten,
it punished itself.
At that point, it would've been
better to shoot it.
Have you always felt this way?
No.
At times I've felt just the opposite.
That desire is a burden
we could well do without.
