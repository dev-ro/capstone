we can't afford good wine
or pink champagne
we ain't got
no open fireplace flame
but we celebrate
the happiness we've found
every night In the best
bedroom In town
every night In the best
bedroom In town
[ cheering, whistling ]
thank you.
thank you very much.
any fool can see
that love Is blind
here I am to prove it
one more time
forget about my pride
I didn't mean to catch you
by surprise
I hope that Isn't pity
In your eyes
I've tried so hard
to stay away
and keep you off my mind
I know I should
but it's no good
as time goes by
and I'm not
over you
I'll gladly be a fool
In love again
If there's a chance
that you might see me
touch me, want me
never leave me
'cause I'm still goin' crazy
over you
I'm never gettin' over you
it's been a month.
how do you like it ?
one more cup of coffee
then I'll go
but there's one more thing
I think you ought to know
the days go by
but nothin's changed
I'm still here
for the takin'
and just a touch
would mean so much
to one whose heart
Is breakin'
over you
I'll gladly be a fool
In love again

tryin' to find
my way around again
same old drink across
that dim-lit bar
checkin' out
who the singles are
bartender
send her one on me
she smiled and turned to me
cautiously
I hear my guitar on--
what the hell
are you doin' here ?
I was hopin' to say hello
to sue anne.
get harry In here right away.
you stay away from her.
do you hear me ?
you stay away from her,
or I warn you, I'll have
the law on you.
all she remembers about you
Is a mean drunk tryin'
to beat up her mama.
- you're dead as far
as she's concerned, mac.
- how you been ?
she never thinks about you.
she's happy.
lady, you're not tellin' me
what to do.  You never have.
harry, get him out of here.
I do not want him around.
who the hell
does she think she Is ?
she starts yellin' at me.
he Is jealous of me because
I am successful and he's not.
it's the way it's always been.
bullshit.
bullshit !  Make sure
he doesn't see sue anne, okay ?
all right.
just make sure he does not
see sue anne.  You understand ?
all right.  Settle down.
okay ?
settle down !
how could--  what--
I--  you know, sometimes--
jesus christ.
you're home early.
uh-huh.
concert must not
have been very long.
it was the regular time.
I left early.
why ?
I didn't care for it.
why not ?
sonny In bed ?
uh-huh.
what you been doin' ?
[ sighs ]
not much.
you watch your tv ?
nope.
then why are you so quiet ?
are you mad about somethin' ?
my god, woman.
don't tell me you're jealous.
rosa lee,
are you jealous of dixie scott ?
[ clears throat ]
maybe I am.
why ?
[ sighs ]
'cause, you know.
no, I don't know.
well, because she's rich
and famous, and you used to be
married to her.
my god, don't be jealous
of her, rosa lee.
she's poison to me.
she's absolutely poison to me.
then why did you go
listen to her sing ?
someday I'll tell you.
why can't you tell me now ?
because I can't.
why not ?
because I can't.
why ?
because I can't.  Goddamn it,
don't you understand english ?
I understand english, and
you don't have to yell at me.
you'll wake up sonny.
[ sighs ]
look, mac.
If you went hopin'
to see your daughter,
I could understand that.
I mean, you could come right out
and tell me that.
I'd be lyin' If I told you
that was the reason.
why ?  Didn't you want
to see her ?
of course I did.
I tried to, but dixie saw me
and pitched a fit.
[ sighs ]
how long's it been
since you saw her ?
since before the divorce--
seven, eight years.
[ sighs ]
sorry.
[ harry ]
mac, dixie told me to bring that
back to you myself--
tell ya it ain't no good.
she told me even If it was good,
she wouldn't sing it,
and she don't wanna have
nothin' to do with you.
I don't want anything
to do with her either.
I just wrote this song.
I thought it was a good song
for her.  I guess I was wrong.
now did you get a look
at it ?
yeah.  I looked at it.
well, what do you think ?
I don't think
it's no good either.
[ harry ]
it's a different game now.
well, that's fine.
ma'am.
I don't give a goddamn about
any of this no more, so what
In hell Is wrong with me ?
I guess it's about sue anne
bein' grown up and all.
no, no, no.
it's gotta be hard on you
not bein' able to see her.
[ engine starting ]
I love you, you know ?
every night
when I say my prayers...
and I thank the lord
for his blessings and
his tender mercies to me,
you and sonny head the list.
thank you.
would you, uh,
would you sing the song
you wrote to me ?
- well, it's no good.
- well, I sure would like
to hear it.
all right,
but it's kind of corny.
I don't care.
well, you asked for it.
let me get your guitar
for you.
all right.
let's see now.
baby,
you're the only dream
I've ever had
that's come true
there's so much more
to reach for
thanks to you
all that I have Is--
[ voice fades ]
got no voice.
you know I don't like a song.
I never have, and I never will.
mac.
hey, don't feel sorry
for me, rosa lee.
I'm not dead, you know.
I don't feel sorry for you.

[ horn honking ]

you dumb son of a bitch ?
are you crazy ?
- hi.
- hi.  Is mr. Sledge around ?
no, he's not here right now.
tell you the truth, I don't know
where he Is, and I'm not real
sure when he's coming back.
oh, well,
I just wanted to holler
at him If he was here.
um, we're playin' at a dance
around here this saturday night,
and I was wonderin'
If we could leave one
of our posters with you.
oh, sure.
thanks.
well, I'll be seein' ya.
sometimes
some things
are hard to break
with me
it's reality
and though someone
will take my place
I'll go on
lovin' you
through eternity
but, oh, it hurts
so much to face
reality
I wonder where mac Is.
[ rosa lee ]
I don't know, sonny.
he's older than you are.
he's 15 years older than you.
that's no secret.
everybody knows that.
I didn't know it
till they told me at school.
well, I would have told you
If you'd asked me.
was my daddy
older than you ?
mm-hmm.  Two years.
let's see, uh--
I got married when I was 16,
and I had you when I was 17.
and I was a widow at 18.
then how come he went
to vietnam ?
[ vehicle approaching ]
[ vehicle passing ]
he got drafted.  He didn't know
I was gonna have you till after
the army got him.
boy at school says his daddy
told him all they learned
In vietnam was to take dope.
do you think that's right ?
I don't know, sonny.
I hope not.
-you think my daddy took drugs ?
-no, I don't think so.
the kids at school
take drugs.
I don't wanna hear of you
takin' 'em.  If you do,
I'll have your hide.
what are you so mad about ?
never mind that.  You just
listen to me about them drugs.
where are you goin' ?
I don't know.
I don't wanna stay around you.
[ sighs ]
all right.  Look, sonny.
I'm sorry.
come over here with me.
come here.
look.  I--
I didn't mean to yell at ya.
I'm just a little nervous
tonight, okay ?
what song Is that ?
um, that's somethin'
mac wrote.
[ humming ]
I wish he'd come on home.
where do you think he Is ?
I don't know, sonny.
your guess Is as good as mine.
[ woman on tv ]  fur.
[ man on tv ]
very good.
[ laughing ]
come on.  Alpaca ?
[ man ]
alpac--
[ sonny ]  Is he here ?
no.
why'd you turn off the tv ?
because I was sick of it.
you goin' to bed ?
yes.
when ?
soon.  Go to sleep !
[ vehicle approaching ]
[ vehicle passing ]
show me thy way, o lord,
and teach me thy path.
lead me In thy truth
and teach me,
for thou are the god
of my--
[ car approaching ]
[ car door slams ]
...salvation, on thee
do I wait all the day.
[ key rattles In lock ]
mac ?
that you ?
I'm not drunk.
I bought a bottle,
but I poured it all out.
and I'm not drunk.
- have anything to eat ?
- no.
are you hungry ?
I guess so.
let me get you something.
[ sighs ]  what do you want
to eat ?  I made some soup.
want me to heat it up ?
a little soup
will do me.
okay.
I rode by here
six or seven times.
I could see y'all
sittin' here watchin' tv.
- see me ride by ?
- no.
I rode all over town tonight.
started twice for san antone.
turned around and came back.
started for austin;
started for dallas.
and I turned around,
came back.
you remember that song
you took over
to that guy In austin ?
yeah.
remember those boys
who had that band who came
down here to see you ?
well, two of them came by
today, and they, uh,
left off a poster.
and, uh, I asked them
If they could read music,
and one of them could, so...
I asked him to teach me
that song you wrote, as I--
I thought I'd try to
surprise you by singin' it
when you came home.
[ chuckles ]
I think it's
a real pretty song, mac.
[ sighs ]
well, and he did too.
and he thought--
well he'd like
for his band to sing it.
I said I didn't know.
I'd have to ask you.
I did say I would ask,
but I said you probably
wouldn't care.
it's an old song.
it wouldn't make any difference.
oh, it's no old song, rosa lee.
I only wrote it last week.
that's why I got upset when
harry said he didn't like it.
I been writin 'em all along.
I-- I even got more In here.
you say the boy liked
the song ?
he said he did.
I sure liked it.
what are the names
of some of your other songs ?
well, one Is called
"the romance Is over,"
and one Is called
"god can forgive me,
why can't you ?"
[ chuckles ]
did you learn the song ?
not well enough to sing it.
can't read music.
how did you learn
to read music, mac ?
I had an auntie
that taught me.
she had an old,
half-busted piano,
and she sat me down
at that piano one summer
when I came In from the fields.
she taught me.
I've been missin'
my music.
it may not be any good anymore,
but that don't keep me
from missin' it.

- he got In just a minute ago.
- you said you were going
to wake me up.
- I forgot.

I don't care If you give
that song to those kids
to play.
all right.

I've ever had
that's come true
come on.
If you just hold

I'll climb

come over here.
you just walked
right outta here.
drinkin' canada dry
since my woman said bye
yes, I'm up here In the cold
and I want to get home
but I'll settle for a high
and as each double
goes down
I toast
another lonely town
this bottle's all I can see
till she comes back with me
drinkin' canada dry
I call on
all the radio stations...
and try to get 'em
to play our records.
I've gotten to know
some of those boys
pretty well.
I was tellin' 'em
about this song--
the ladder song you let us play.
yeah.
they, uh--
they said we ought to try
to talk you Into
lettin' us record it.
hi.
course, they thought
the best Idea would be...
to try to get you to give us
another song too.
and then--  then these
friends of mine said--
I do have another song.
come by the house,
and I'll let you listen
to it.
okay.
thanks.
yeah.
how you doin' ?
mornin'.
what'll you have ?
bag of feed.
okay.
see,
we've been at this now
for four years, and
everybody's married but me.
jake's got
a little girl too.
we still gotta travel
all over the state
to get engagements.
yeah, we didn't clear
but a hundred bucks
last week.
we showed up at the golead
the other night, and they had
another band a-pickin'.
how many recordings
you make ?
three.  But I haven't exactly
told you the truth
about that, though.
they broke even
on all our records, but--
yeah ?
even so, they're not gonna
record us with our own songs.
yeah, it's a--
it's a dirty business.
maybe it's
the best thing that can
happen to you for now.
world Isn't gonna come
to an end, I'll tell ya.
yeah, I guess, but, uh,
like I said,
we heard last week
they'd record us If we used
two of your songs.
I gave you my permission.
I told you that.
yeah, but, uh--
it's not just your songs.
they want you to sing 'em.
who does ?
the record company.
what record company ?
it's called the aztec.
never heard of it.
how do you make it
on a hundred a week ?
[ all chuckling ]
we all got other jobs.
jake's In construction.
I'm a substitute teacher.
I don't know.  Uh--
thank you.
you bet.
uh, let me think
about it.
sure mean a lot to us.
you understand that.
it'd be a real Incentive
for us all.
I'll tell you what.
I ain't promisin' nothin',
you understand.
I'll give it a try.
If I don't like
the way it sounds,
we'll just back away from it.
- okay.
- give me a couple days
to think it over.
thank you.
[ woman ]
hey, mister,
were you really
mac sledge ?
yes, ma'am.
I guess I was.
[ chuckles ]
see that cloud
there In the sky
so lonely
drifting by
well, that's the way
she's adrift
from me
keep all my pride
to myself
I know
there's someone else
but, oh, it hurts
so much to feel
reality
how you doin' ?
[ rosa lee ]  hi, mac.
you got a visitor.
where ?
living room.
yeah ?
do you recognize me ?
yes, I do.
how did you
recognize me ?
I just did.
y'all
excuse us, please ?
you've changed.
you don't look like
your pictures anymore.
don't I ?
well, god knows
when the last picture
of me was taken.
it don't make a whole lot
of difference, but I did try
to get In touch with you.
I wrote a few letters.
did you ever
get 'em ?
no.
well, your mama didn't have
to give 'em to you.
courts gave her
complete jurisdiction.
quite rightly,
I guess, considering...
my state at the time.
I told mama
I was comin' here.
she told me she'd have me
arrested If I did.
and harry reminded her
that I'm 18 now, and
I don't have to mind anybody.
mama says you tried
to kill her once.
[ sighs ]
I did.
why'd you try
to kill her ?
well, she got me mad
some way.
I was drunk.
I don't know.
one of those things.
someone told mama the
other night you were the best
country singer they ever heard.
- [ chuckles ]
- mama threw a glass of whiskey
right In her face.
she said they were just
sayin' that to spite her.
you think you ever will
sing again ?
oh, I think about it
once In a while.
sometimes I think I'd like
to earn a little money to...
make things a little easier
around here...
or to help out
If you ever needed anything.
I don't need any money.
mama set up a trust fund
out of all the royalties
she ever earned...
singin' the songs
that you wrote.
I can buy myself
anything I want.
anything I got
has come from your music.
well, I'm happy for that.
but it wasn't just my music.
it was your mama singin' it too.
you mustn't forget that.
- I know.
- yeah.
you have some supper
with us ?
- well, thank you, no, I can't.
I have a date tonight.
- oh.
plays In mama's band.
we have to sneak around,
'cause mama don't like him.
would you like to meet him ?
he'd like to meet you.
[ breathes deeply ]
I don't think that's
such a good Idea.
I really wouldn't want your mama
to think we was gangin' up
on her behind her back.
I could tell her
I was bringin' him here.
well, all right, then.
how about
tomorrow afternoon ?
fine.
- 2:00 ?
- anytime.  I'll be here.
you know, you haven't
spoken my name once
since I've been here.
don't you know my name ?
sure, I know your name.
I just kinda been
figurin' out to myself
what I ought to call you.
when you were a little girl,
I used to call you "sister."
I started to call you that
this time, when I saw you,
but I didn't know
If it would mean
anything to you or not,
or If you'd remember
me doin' that.
there was a song
you used to sing to me
when I was little, I think.
it was somethin'
about a dove.
mama said she never heard
you sing it to me, but...
I think it went
somethin' about a--
"on the wings
of a snow-white dove,
he sends
his somethin'-somethin' love."
I don't remember that.
I don't.
so who else had
a good science project
besides you ?
uh,
cy henderson.
cy did ?
what'd he do ?
he made this gigantic picture
of the world...
[ car engine starting ]
and he showed the crust
and the--
the core of the earth,
and you could open it up.
when jesus went down
to the waters that day
he was baptized
In the usual way
when it was done
god blessed his soul
he sent him his love
on the wings
of a dove
on the wings
of a snow-white dove
he sends his pure
sweet love
a sign from above
on the wings
of a dove
on the wings
of a dove
[ sighs ]
I'm still goin' crazy
over you
and no, I'm never gettin'
over you
over you
I'd gladly be a fool
In love again
I know I'm never
gettin' over you

[ sighs ]

I try to tell her a lot
of people have been married
at 18.  Some of 'em got kids.
dixie was married
at 18, but I guess

I guess so.  Yeah.

no boy.
thirty years old.
been married
three times already.
look, If you see her,
If you hear from her,
ask her to please
call her mama.
all right.
I will.
I shouldn't have said
what I did about your music.
it's all right.
I can't promise ya
nothin', mac,
but I'll take the song
with me to nashville.
I'll show it
to whoever I can.
what's the $500 for ?
it's earnest money.
it's good faith money.
I owe you that.
no way, harry.
no, sir.
- come on, mac.
- no, sir.
you don't owe me
anything.
besides, I've got...
other plans for the song
right now.
you got other songs, mac ?
yeah, I do.
- you gonna show 'em to me ?
- no.
- come on, for christ sake !
- no, goddamn it, harry.
don't you understand english ?
I don't want
to show 'em to you.
why ?
because I don't want to,
so stop buggin' me.
you can't get sore at me
for askin' you that.
change the subject, harry.
this Is my business,
for christ sake !
look, you want to do
somethin' with your music,
you know how to get ahold of me.
all right.
you were 16
when you got married ?
yeah.
dixie was, what, 18
when I married her,
and I was 17
when I married
the first time.
you never told me
you were married before dixie.
no ?
uh-uh.
I thought I told you
everything about me.
oh, well, you didn't
tell me that.
well--
I was tryin' to get
started In the business.
I was singin' In any
honky-tonk bar that would
let me through the door.
and I wandered
from town to town,
city to city,
lookin' for places
to sing.
findin' any kind of work
I could In a day
to keep me alive...
so I could sing
and play at night.
finally, lois--
my first wife's name--
couldn't stand it;
she went home.
and I went back
six months later
lookin' for her,
and I found her
livin' with another man.
said she wanted a divorce,
so, hell, I gave it to her.
swore I'd never
marry again.
and when I met dixie,
it changed my mind.
[ chuckles ]
I was makin' a few records
by then, and she was singin'
when I met her,
and she said she'd give it up
when she got married,
but then she recorded
a song of mine,
and she done well with it...
and said she wanted to sing
for five years and get it
out of her system.
never happened.
never did.
[ chuckles ]
never did.
when at last
I kneel on the shore
and the fearful
breakers wall
which span
the peaceful lands
the valley of the blessed
then I hear him saying
to me
then I
will finally see
upon your profession of faith
In our lord jesus christ,
I baptize you In the name
of the father...
and of the son
and of the holy spirit.
upon your profession of faith
In our lord jesus christ,
I baptize you In the name
of the father...
and of the son
and of the holy spirit.
[ man ]
amen.  Amen.
well, we done it, mac.
we're baptized.
yeah, we are.
everybody said I was gonna feel
like a changed person.
I guess I do feel a little
different, but I don't feel
a whole lot different.
do you ?
not yet.
you don't look
any different.
[ chuckles ]

any different ?

they got a wire this mornin'
that my daughter was killed...
In an automobile accident
somewhere...
In northern louisiana.
I didn't catch
the name of the town.
[ acoustic guitar: waltz ]
a little child
boy or girl
will dream at night
In their own dream world
and as they play
they pretend that they
believe
well, I'm no child
but times it's true
I pretend
I'm not losing you
because it hurts
so much to face
reality
dixie's not doing
well at all.
what about
sue anne's husband ?
well, he's gonna live.
In the hospital.
he-he was drunk.
it was all
his fault.
dixie wanted a closed casket
on account of the accident.
I thought it would be
easier on her,
on-on everybody...
If we left this down
at the funeral parlor, but...
she wanted it brought
back home.
little sister.
dixie ?
dixie, mac Is here.
where Is he ?
he's right here.
hello, dixie.
hi, mac.
mac,
why has god
done this to me ?
why has god
done this to me ?
[ sighs ]
oh, you know, I did everything
I could to stop her.  I--
I begged and I pleaded
and, um,
I gave her everything
In the world she ever wanted.
[ sobs ]
I had nothin'
when I was her age.
do you remember ?
[ whispers ]
yeah.
[ sobs ]
I gave her everything
money could buy.
[ sobbing ]
that was
our little girl, mac.
[ sobbing continues ]
no, see, I want to see
my little girl.
I brought her back here
to be with me.
just let me out !
I want to be
with my little girl !
let me go, you son of a bitch !
no !  No !
[ wailing ]
be still.  Be still.
[ wailing subsides ]
[ hens clucking ]
mac ?
you okay ?
I was almost killed once
In a car accident.
I was drunk...
and I ran off
the side of the road
and I turned over four times.
and they took me
out of that car for dead,
but I lived.
and I prayed last night
to know why...
I lived and she died,
but I got no answer
to my prayers.
I still don't know why
she died and I lived.
I don't know
the answer to nothin'--
not a blessed thing.
I don't know why I wandered out
to this part of texas drunk...
and you took me In
and pitied me and helped me
to straighten out,
marry me.
why ?  Why did that happen ?
Is there a reason
that happened ?
and sonny's daddy died
In a war--
[ Inhales sharply ]
my daughter killed
In an automobile accident.
why ?
you see,
I don't trust happiness.
I never did.
I never will.
[ brakes squeal ]
where's mac ?
he's outside.
he got you something.
it's In your room.
how did my daddy die ?
- I don't know, sonny.
- was he killed In battle ?
honey, I just don't know.
didn't you ever ask
anybody ?
yes, I asked someone.
and they couldn't tell me
anything except
that he'd been found dead.
see, he was alone
when they found him,
and they couldn't be sure
how long he'd been there...
or If he'd been In a battle,
which battle, because there were
three In the area that week.
it could have been
In any of 'em, they said.
or he could have been
out walking, they said,
and a sniper got him.
where would he
be walking to ?
they didn't have
any more Idea than I did.
he was just a boy.
but he was a good boy.
I think he would have been
a fine man.
I think you would have been
proud of him.
I know he would have been
proud of you.

of a dove," Indistinct ]

of your true love
broke them down

In my heart tonight
when the morning sun
comes shining through
I'll still be holding you
