You're a big boy.
Take care
of everybody.
Bye.
You stay
in school, OK?
Be a good girl.
Come on.
Be good, yes.
Shh, shh, shh.
Quiet.
Quiet.
You bring it back
to us safely.
This lance is
the life of our people.
94 WYSP, Philadelphia.
Classic rock 'n' roll...
Charlie, can you
give me a cup
of coffee?
Yeah, ok, Buster.
If you have something
you'd like to hear,
right now we'll take care
of a call
from Center City,
Philadelphia,
for Gregg Allman,
when the bullets fly.
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, on your way,
sister.
This is for paying
customers only.
Charlie,
she's with me.
Yeah?
You look real
beautiful tonight.
Kind of brighten up
the place.
You want to party?
No.
But I'll buy you
a drink.
Bourbon and coke.
Step out
of the car.
Check this out.
They're gonna fuck it up.
Who?
The cops.
May I please
see some license
and registration?
You don't like cops?
I hate them.
Is that your
current address?
Yeah.
Check it out.
What did I do?
Come on.
Hey.
I wouldn't go sit
by that window.
Legs out.
Feet back.
Out of the car.
Hands on the back
of the car.
Get down!
Drop it!
Drop it!
I said drop it,
or he's dead!
Now!
Ok. Take it easy.
Shut the fuck up
or I'll blow his fucking
head off.
Let the officer go,
then we'll talk.
I mean it, man,
I'm gonna kill this
motherfucker!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Charlie, I'll have to
catch you next time.
Put them down! Now!
Ok! We're
putting them down!
Put your
weapons down!
Put them down! Now!
Put them down!
Come on! Now!
See?
What's all
the commotion here?
What's going on here?
Get out of there!
Hey, buddy.
I'm just trying
to find my fucking car, OK?
Get out of there!
Why don't
you just relax?
I'm really
sorry about this.
I can't find my car.
You should relax.
You'd have a much
better time.
Just relax there,
buddy, OK?
Hey, hey!
What are you doing,
man, huh?
Let's see
if you got any brains.
You tell your fucking friends
to drop their guns now!
Drop your guns!
Drop it!
Ok, asshole!
Come on!
Come on, asshole!
Now!
Ok, let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
Do it now!
Get him over here.
He's packing,
Sarge--.38.
Who the hell are you?
You're a menace,
and this city doesn't
need people like you
getting in the way
of police business.
I guess you should've
stayed home?
You got a license
for this?
Yeah.
Where?
Right here.
Come on, McHenry.
See ya around, guys.
Be cool, man.
Officer McHenry, this
is detective Geddies.
We've met.
I'm aware of that.
You will now apologize
to detective Geddies.
What should I do,
promise I won't
hit him again?
Damn it, Buster.
You can't go
hitting cops.
The guy
put his gun down.
He's got no brains,
no balls. Cigarette?
I'm trying to quit.
I thought you
were on vacation.
Don't I look
relaxed?
You look like the inside
of a chicken coop.
You working something
on your own?
You could try
talking to me.
Maybe
I can help.
I don't need help.
No backup, no report.
What do you mean,
"No report"?
No paperwork.
Just give me
a couple days.
If you're going
after somebody
in the department--
Now what's
going on here?
Mike, I spent a night
in the drunk tank.
I'm tired.
I'd like to go home
and take a shower.
Fine. Go home.
Go to Nassau.
Just don't
fuck up again,
because I can't
cover you next time.
If I fuck up,
I'm going to be dead.
That's not funny.
I'll give you a ride.
There they are.
How are you doing?
Nema.
Hey, Corvo.
Showtime.
I hope so.
What's going on?
The guy's
not here yet.
You want something
to drink? Eat?
No, not your food.
No, not your food.
Nothing changes.
What do you say?
How you doing?
Good.
Have a seat.
I gotta talk to him.
I hope
you understand.
Yes, I understand.
Ok.
I'll call you.
Ok.
You're late.
Yeah.
So where's
the cop?
Why, are you
nervous?
Why, should I be?
We're going in
for a great deal
of money.
You're not nervous?
That makes me
very nervous.
You got
the combination, right?
The cop gives me
the combination, then I--
The deal changed.
The bookkeeper will have
the combination.
I brought you...
the best deal
on this planet, man--
$2 million
in stolen diamonds,
completely untraceable.
Your end of the deal
was the damn cop
gives me the combination.
That's my security!
Who the fuck
do you think
you're talking to,
some street punk?
You brought this
to me. Thank you.
It works out great.
You help me,
I help you.
You feel you can't
trust me, walk out.
You already know
how to use the door.
Hey...
forget it.
Let's just get it
over with.
He's right.
Let's go.
Yes?
Uh, I'm here
to pick up a ring.
Ray Danelli.
Mr. Rosen said I should
come by this morning.
Just a minute, please.
Ok.
You can see
Mr. Weinstock.
He's inside.
How are you?
Normally, we like
to have the person
who took care
of you help you,
but Mr. Rosen
is no longer with us.
I think you'll be
pleased, though.
The setting
is very popular.
Tell the receptionist
to open the front door,
Mr. Weinstock.
Now.
Do it.
Live to collect
that insurance.
Rose!
Would you buzz open
the front door, please?
Nobody's out there.
Just do it, please!
Yes, Mr. Weinstock.
Come on!
Get up.
Get in the back.
Open the door,
please.
Come on!
Sit down!
Don't play with me,
old man.
Sit down.
Put your head down.
Take anything you want,
but please don't
hurt anybody. Please--
Aah!
Shut up, bitch.
Keep your eyes
on the fucking wall.
Eyes on the wall!
I said shut up.
This is nice.
It's nice.
You know, I'd
really appreciate it
if you'd turn around
and face the wall,
and, uh...
no alarms for, let's say,
uh, 10 minutes. Please?
Or this
is what you'll get.
Come on, man,
let's go.
What the fuck
are you doing?
There was supposed
to be no shooting.
Guys. Guys.
He was weak enough
to make a deal,
he's weak enough
to talk about it.
We're wasting time.
Go around the back!
Go around the back!
Go around
the fucking back!
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
Go!
Ok, let's go!
Let's go!
Come on,
let's get out of here!
Come on!
Come on!
Stop! Police!
Freeze!
Come on!
Fucking idiot.
Freeze!
Get out of the way!
Stop! Police!
Go!
Everybody down.
It's clear.
Come on, Bob,
we've got to move.
Let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Goddamn it.
Come on, Bobby.
We ain't
got time for this.
No! No.
George!
Back off.
Come on.
You drive, partner.
The lance.
Jesus Christ, man!
That way!
Hey, watch out,
you lunatic!
Let's go.
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?
Just give me a second here!
Kill him, man.
No! Come on!
Move!
Holy shit!
Watch it!
Hey!
Hey, this guy's
stealing my car, officer.
Watch it!
Shit.
H-Hey.
Aah!
Watch it.
Watch out!
Watch out!
Watch out!
Oh!
Nice driving, partner.
Turn left over there.
Right there.
Yeah.
No!
Close the door.
Unh.
Ohh.
Hey, Bob.
Look who's here.
Boss, boss...
I'm so glad
I found you guys.
Thanks for your
help, partner.
Hey, boss,
I tried, boss.
Get me to a hospital.
Please.
Police officer.
You can't die yet.
I need you alive.
We're here.
This is not a hospital.
You got any
money on you?
Come on. I don't
have all day.
In the jacket.
Got it.
Can you walk?
Good.
I'd like a room.
Indian, huh?
Two beds.
How much will
that run me?
40 a night.
I'll take it.
Come on.
I'm sorry, chief.
Elevator's
out of order.
I ain't going to make it
up the stairs.
Ohh!
Must be on
their honeymoon.
What's up, Captain?
One of your men
may have been involved
in that jewelers' row
armed robbery.
Buster McHenry?
Maybe he was
in the area.
He's been
working undercover.
He wasn't there
as a cop.
He was part
of the crime.
You sure about that?
Since when has McHenry
been working undercover?
Uh... he's doing
something on his own.
Like what?
Lieutenant,
I've got two men dead,
people shooting at cops,
five vehicles
busted to shit.
Now, slowly,
for my enjoyment,
say you don't know
his assignment.
He'll call.
I'll check it out.
Get his ass in here, OK?
Before I get pissed off.
What's with you,
Lieutenant?
Why do you always
take the heat
for that kid?
He's OK.
I don't think so.
He's a fucking crook
like his old man.
So just shut up!
Get out
of my office.
George is gone.
I'm sorry.
Dad...
I need your help.
I thought you might.
He'll live...
I think.
You did good.
The Lakotas...
as far as I know,
have never been without
the lance.
I'll get it back.
I know you will.
When you left home
I thought I lost you forever
and that hurt me.
But then, when you came back,
at first, I didn't
understand why.
I got tired of being
on the road.
No.
You came back because
that's where you belong.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Nice girl.
Nice girl.
Hey, Bobby.
Girl.
He's a cop.
A dead cop?
Nobody knows
anything.
They haven't
found a body.
Assume he's alive.
Get the word out.
Find him
before the cops do.
You got it.
Mmmph!
We're getting
out of here.
Do that to me again,
I'll kill you.
Expecting company?
I don't know.
You tell me.
You want to tell me
what I'm doing here?
You're going to help me
find your partner.
I'm taking back
what he stole.
Then I'm going to
kill him. Let's go.
Hey.
Was there an old Indian
praying over me
the other night?
That's right.
You don't believe
in that shit, do you?
I am that shit.
I don't see him.
Hey.
Outside. Outside.
Is your daddy home?
No?
Is your mama home?
Do you know where
my clothes are?
No.
They're in the wash.
Jimmy, why don't you
go watch some TV
or something, OK?
I brought you
something to eat.
Thanks.
So how long
have I, uh...
been asleep?
About a day or so.
24 hours, like a day?
That's right.
Smells good.
Glad to see
you're feeling better.
I hate to disappoint
you, chief,
but all you got
was a cop.
I'm a police
officer.
I was working
undercover.
Don't lie to me.
You don't
believe me?
Do I have
to prove it?
Yeah.
Prove it.
I don't have to prove
anything to you.
Is that right?
Hey.
That guy that killed
your friend...
his name is Marino.
He had a bad cop
working for him.
I was going for the cop.
I never expected it
to go down like that.
I'm really sorry
about your friend,
OK?
He was my brother.
We'll get
started tomorrow.
Do you know
what this is?
Yeah, Dad, I know.
It's your medicine stone.
I've had it
since I was 14.
It's brought me
a lot of luck.
Now, there's your
good luck stone.
Could I get
something to eat?
You better take it.
I think you're
going to need it.
What have you got?
The address
on the Indians
didn't check out.
What about family,
friends, uh...
anybody connected
to the museum?
There's a woman
in Frankfurt.
Well, all right.
You got an address?
Yeah.
99 Chissler Street.
You want these?
Uh, yeah.
Just drop them
on my desk, OK?
Sure,
Lieutenant.
You do good work, chief.
I feel great.
Thanks.
I might have died, huh?
You still might.
Hey...
you want Marino, right?
So do I.
I like to work alone.
Why don't you let me go,
and I'll go find him.
I'll bring your spear back.
What'd you say?
Get moving.
Okay, fine.
But we do things my way.
Ok.
First thing we gotta do
is go to my place.
I gotta get some guns.
If you're nice, I might
even show you my badge.
I'll drive.
Trust me, I'm the Indian
around here.
Thanks.
What are you trying to do,
flood it?
No, I'm putting some gas
in the carburetor.
Right here.
See that thing here?
Butterfly valve.
Put your finger on it.
I'll start her up.
Still got your finger on it?
I'll drive this time.
Chief, come on.
My wounds.
Ow! Okay.
Ok, it wasn't
a nice thing to do,
but I don't wanna hear
you talking about
killing Marino.
I'm gonna take him down,
and if we're gonna work
together, you don't kill him.
And I promise I won't
try and ditch you.
What's so funny?
No, really,
I appreciate a good story.
My brother, George,
you know,
the one you killed?
I didn't kill him.
He used to lie a lot
when he was younger.
Just like you.
One day, an older boy
took a hunting knife
and cut his tongue.
It's just a little cut
but it must have hurt.
It scared him.
That's the funniest story
I ever heard.
Shit.
Keep going.
Cops?
Yeah, they were watching
my goddamn house.
What about the guns?
I got another idea.
Turn left up here.
I bet one of these guys
will be packing.
Is that so?
My old man
used to always say,
"You got to trust
somebody sometime."
My dad told me
that when I did,
I'd pick
the wrong person.
You ain't got
no problems here.
We seem to
get along fine, chief.
Listen,
I'm not a chief,
so don't call me
Chief.
My name is
Hank Storm, ok?
Sorry,
about that, Hank.
Buster McHenry.
Nice to meet you.
First sign
of trouble,
I'll break
your neck, Buster.
How are you
doing?
Fine.
How are you doing?
Good. Chief here
needs a little
something
to take back
to the reservation.
Put some crack
in them peace pipes.
Can you help us out?
Yeah, I think
I can help you out.
Come on.
That's far enough,
gentlemen.
Now, I have to
see the money.
Well, uh,
we got to see
the stuff first.
Wait here.
Have you ever been
to Philadelphia
before, Hank?
Nope.
No, no,
no, no, wait.
Dogs love me.
Watch this.
Hi, puppy.
Hello.
Jesus.
Son of a bitch.
Chief, there is something
wrong with that dog.
Yeah.
Fuck, I don't
believe this.
Hank, what the hell
are you doing?
Hank, close the door.
Here, puppy.
Ok, I'll take
the skinhead.
What's this shit?
Get inside!
So, you're
the injun?
Oh, you're sharp.
How much money are
we talking about?
1,200.
Well, let me see
the money.
No.
Let me see
the money, chief.
I wouldn't
call him that.
He really
doesn't like that.
I don't give a fuck
what he likes.
Now!
I'd show him
the money.
Why not?
Hey!
It's tucked into
my boot.
Check him.
Hey, wait a second.
This is completely
unnecessary.
All we're trying to do
is have a clean deal.
Oh, shit.
Hank!
Hank!
You OK?
Give me the gun.
It's mine.
Sorry.
Come on.
Ok, I'll take
these guys.
No way. Not today.
Freeze right there!
You're under arrest.
I'm ordering you
to drop your gun now!
Drop it!
I said drop it!
Drop it!
It's not worth it.
We got away.
That's all.
Ok, jump.
Are you crazy?
I got to take
a couple of steps.
Whoa!
Son of a bitch!
What are you,
crazy?
Give me the
goddamn gun.
That's my gun.
Give me the
goddamn gun!
You want the gun?
Yeah.
Take it.
Oh, shit.
Oh.
Well, I'm having
a good time.
How about you?
You're lucky
I'm wounded, chief.
We've wasted
enough time.
Let's go find
your friend.
I'm going to
find him,
and he's
not my friend.
I, uh, pursued the suspect
across the roof.
You sure
it was McHenry?
Yes, sir.
I'm pretty sure.
I pursued them
across the roof,
and they got away.
You can go.
Yes, sir.
I'm through
messing around
with this guy.
I want a warrant
out on McHenry.
Ok.
What are we
doing here?
Trust me.
Sure.
Yes, Mr. Dibiossi,
how are you today?
That's fine.
Yes, we have a reservation
for you at 8:30.
Uh-huh. And, uh...
I'll see you later,
Mr. Dibiossi.
I got to talk
to you.
What are you
doing here?
Shut up!
What are you, crazy?
Don't.
Take it easy.
What are you
looking at?
Get up against
the wall.
Get on the floor.
Now!
Move!
Grab a piece
of wall, asshole.
Up against
the wall now!
Get up
against the wall.
Now. Now!
You're asking for it.
Who the fuck
asked you?
Spit that out!
You move,
and I'll blow them
out your back.
You understand me?
Get in there. Move!
What are you doing?
Get out of here!
Man, go away, man!
I got one question
for you, asshole.
One time.
Where's Marino?
I don't know!
I'll fillet
your ass.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Ow!
Where is he?
He's at the girl's house.
You know, Barbara.
Where?
The apartment over
the beauty parlor!
Where?
89th and Snider.
Get up!
Just watch the cars!
Shut up!
OK, I didn't
do nothing.
Give me
the car keys.
Did I do
anything to you?
Come on.
Shit, man.
Come on, really--
Get in
the goddamn trunk.
I ain't going
in there, man.
Please.
I'm claustrophobic.
Get in
the goddamn trunk.
Come on, man,
watch it.
Come on, let me out!
Hey, guys,
this ain't funny no more.
Come on,
let me out of here!
I got to go to
the bathroom!
Come on, please.
This ain't funny no more.
Yes.
I'll take care of it.
We got the cop
and the Indian.
I think he wants
his spear back.
If you'd checked with me,
we wouldn't be
dealing with this.
I'm sorry.
It happened.
This is a clean
operation, no guns.
There's nothing
to worry about.
I'll take care
of the cop.
No.
You don't like
that idea, Lieutenant?
No, I don't.
Now, you stay
out of this.
I'll handle it
from here on.
So, who's
the old man?
Is he your
grandfather?
Father.
Is he the chief?
No. He's
a Wichasha Wakon.
He's a medicine man.
He has visions.
How about you,
your old man a cop?
He was.
He had visions, too.
They just weren't legal.
He did, uh, two years
in the state pen
for receiving
stolen property.
He was in with
a couple bad cops.
He was the only one
who did time, though.
Come on,
let me out, man!
Come on, please.
Please!
Aw, man, come on.
Let me out of here!
Ok, Annette,
here I come.
Ready.
Nice place
you got here.
Tell Marino I'm busy,
and I can't see him.
No, you don't understand.
We should talk
back there for a sec.
Talk here. Annette
doesn't mind, right?
I don't mind.
Who's your friend?
You mean the chief?
My name is Hank.
Hi.
Look,
you're making me
nervous, OK?
Talk. Otherwise
I don't need
you guys
hanging around
my shop.
Yeah. Excuse us,
Annette.
Do me a favor
and call upstairs now.
My mother
lives upstairs.
You want to
talk to her?
Just do it.
Do it yourself.
Is Marino upstairs,
or isn't he?
If he is,
he must be hiding.
I haven't seen him
in days.
Where the hell is he?
I got to speak to him.
You owe money
and want to
pay him back.
Ask his friends
where he is.
I don't need this.
This is not
a goddamn joke.
Hey, hey.
We have to find Marino,
and we can't ask his friends.
Can you help us out?
Who the fuck
are you?
Right. Look,
I don't want
trouble in my shop.
Why don't you guys
just leave, ok?
Oh, god.
Move, move, move.
Get down!
Run!
Go!
What the hell
is going on?
There are two guys
coming down the alley
with guns. Go, hurry!
Freeze!
Drop your weapons!
Freeze!
Halt! Freeze! Police!
Come on. Let's go.
You got to promise me
you'll let me
take Marino alive.
Sorry, I just
can't do that.
I wish you'd
change your mind.
What's wrong
with you?
Get out of here!
I had to do it.
He would've
screwed things up.
Come on.
Holy shit.
What the...
excuse me.
No way.
Yeah.
So you thought
you lost him, ok?
Ooh.
Oh, are you ok?
Oh, yes,
thank you.
Thank you.
You over here?
Yes. The taxi
over here.
You could do me
a huge favor.
While we're talking,
look over
my shoulder
and tell me if
you see an Indian
following me.
Yeah. A whole tribe...
with war paint,
coming this way.
Excuse me.
You have a nice day.
Where do you
keep your car?
Outside
the beauty parlor.
What about money?
Excuse me. I forgot
to take my purse.
Hi, guys.
Nema.
I want you to
do something for me.
Take the kids
to the store
and buy them
something for me.
You've been
too noisy?
No.
No.
Ok. Let's go, guys.
I can lose him here.
It'll take a minute.
You're
a real lunatic.
A crazy man.
Just give me
five minutes, ok?
Excuse me.
Sir, may I help you?
No.
Pardon me.
Excuse me,
can I help you?
Give me the phone.
We need
security here.
See you.
Jesus Christ.
I don't think
he's all right.
It's this
gentleman here.
I think there's
something wrong
with him.
All right, sir,
if you'll--
Oh.
Goddamn it.
The store doesn't
want trouble.
We'll take care of--
Police officer.
Freeze, don't move.
We'll handle this.
You guys have done
a phenomenal job
already.
This asshole
has been pretending
he's an Indian.
I want a badge number--
Fuck off, asshole.
I'm making
an arrest.
Here.
What did you do,
jump off the train?
Pretty slick.
What are you
doing here?
Nothing in my size.
Here.
Come on, Hank.
I have to
see my father.
It's open.
Good evening.
I'm Lieutenant
Michael Finch.
I'm with the Philadelphia
police department.
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.
Is your son
Hank Storm?
Yes.
We have
reason to believe
that your son
has been seen with--
What are you
doing here?
Where's the Indian
and his friend?
Please tell me.
You came
to the wrong place.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Damn it!
What did you do?
He pulled a knife.
What did you do?
Drop it!
Drop it!
Now, who do you
think you are?
I have the diamonds.
We're not talking
about diamonds.
The man is dead.
What's he going
to tell us now?
Ask him.
Out.
Wait right here.
Hank.
We got to go.
I was doing it
all for him.
Then you got
to keep on it.
Come on.
Bobby, no!
No, Bobby!
No!
Hank!
Get me an ambulance.
Freeze!
Drop your guns!
Hands behind your head,
both of you!
Now!
Hands behind your head!
Up against the car.
Get over
against there.
Get your hands back!
Check for other victims.
I'll take over.
Get some men
and check
inside the house.
I'll get it.
I'll take over,
officer.
We got it under--
You got a problem
with that?
Come on,
take him along.
Mike, I'm sorry.
Shut up.
Wait here.
Mike.
Put him in the car.
Whose car is this?
Well, well, well.
Look who we got here.
Hiya, Lieutenant.
Take the car back.
I'll ride with them.
Is this your car?
Yeah. Get in.
You're a regular
crime wave, McHenry.
It must run
in the family.
Back off, Denny.
Listen
to me, Buster.
You're in
real trouble
this time,
you know that?
Murder,
armed robbery.
You got anything
to say to me?
Give him to me
for 10 minutes.
He'll talk.
Shut up.
Talk, Buster.
You were
going under
to find a cop.
What about that?
I haven't found him,
but I will.
How close
are you?
Real close.
12 hours.
Could you find
him in 12 hours?
Mike,
don't do this.
I'll say
what he does.
There's
a warrant out.
12 hours.
Can you do it?
Yeah.
I'll bring you him
and the $6 million
in diamonds.
The report
I read said
2 million.
No.
No, I was there.
I opened the safe.
6 at least.
Fine.
Ok, let's go.
Jesus Christ.
Help the Indian.
I said
help the Indian.
You bring him back
with the diamonds
to me.
I'm trusting you,
Buster.
It's my ass.
Ok.
I owe you,
Lieutenant.
That car was there
when my father
was killed.
That's right.
He was a friend?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
So am I.
Where you going?
Marino's ranch?
You son of a bitch.
Man's got to
make a living.
I'll go with you.
Good.
Now I can get
them both.
He's too smart
for his own good.
Damn it!
Go right.
Right?
Yes, right.
Check it out.
Straight.
No. We should
go left.
There's too many
houses that way.
Right leads
to the highway.
Straight ahead.
We got to talk.
Upstairs.
Damn it! We're
completely lost.
They got to still be
on the main road.
Come on, let's go.
What do you think
you're doing?
This way.
Are you
kidding me?
Trust me.
I'm the Indian
around here.
Great.
Want a drink, Mike?
No.
I'm having one.
What about you,
Bobby?
Not when
I play poker.
What do you want,
Mike?
Taking all
their money?
Anyone who's
not happy
is free to leave
the game.
Yeah.
6 million
in diamonds, Bobby.
Not 2.
You caught McHenry.
He let him go.
I tried telling him.
What the fuck
are you--
Watch your mouth, Bobby.
I'm not
one of your slugs.
I have other cops
besides you...
you don't have me!
Who could--
Like ransom?
Who else you got?
You were a punk
when I met you,
and you still are.
I should have
walked away.
I'm a punk,
and you're
a dirty cop.
Who do you think
respects you?
Give me my cut.
We're finished.
Where's McHenry now?
Both of them
followed us.
The Indian?
Good.
McHenry's
got to go, Mike.
You know that.
Look, the kid's father
was my friend.
We both could've
done some time...
but he took the rap.
You could still
do some time, Mike.
Stop the car.
What now?
Son of a bitch.
Roll over it
a few times.
How many of them
out there?
They were alone.
Don't sound like that
to me. Let's go.
Benji, stay
in the house.
Lights on.
Here, you want it?
Come and get it.
Let's go.
JJ.
See where
Frank and
Rob are.
Shit.
Come on.
Frank and Rob
are both down.
Who's out there?
I don't know.
There's no crowd.
The Indian will go
for the house.
Shoot a flare.
Denny, let's
cover the back.
Shoot some flares
in the loft.
You sure?
Do it.
Shit!
Aah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Can you ride?
No.
You go.
I'll cover you.
It's good luck.
It couldn't hurt.
Move.
Not the horses!
Hold your fire!
Aah.
Unh!
Hyah... hah!
Buster!
Come on,
you son of a bitch.
Shoot! Come on!
You don't
understand.
I trusted you, Mike.
Nobody else
has to get hurt.
Is that what you said
to my old man?
He didn't
have to go down.
He made a bad move.
That's all.
So did you, Mike.
Put your hands
on your head.
No.
Aah!
Unh.
Ah!
Ohh.
This valley is where
our grandfathers'
grandfathers
fought the last big battle
before we signed the treaty.
The battle of Round Ridge.
The cavalry
outnumbered us 2-to-1.
We still
kicked their butts.
That's the last time
the lance was carried
into battle.
The cavalry
came from the north.
Our people were here.
Hey, you're
under arrest.
Buster.
How you doing,
chief?
Good. It's good
to be back.
You're a long way
from home.
Yeah, they
made me leave town
for my vacation.
I'm actually
on probation.
My story stuck,
though. I'll be ok.
I might get
a commendation
after
the investigation
is over.
You might
even deserve it.
Yeah.
Uh...
I really
came out here
just to say thanks.
I'm going
to be in town
a couple days
if you want
to find me.
I found you last time.
Yeah, you did.
