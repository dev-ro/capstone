Sadness has many faces.
Like flowers, birds and winds.
I tried to tell through some of
my closed friends...
...the sadness,
love and sorrow.
Although it has been deemed
incomprehensible and...
...inconceivable by some people.

Hope fully next week.
The prison authorities have notices
that certain inmates don't...
...comply with the prison rules.
- What else shall we do?
- Those inmates will be punished.
- As if they don't punish.
As it is known, all kinds o f leaves
are suspended as o f martial law.
Yet, some inmates still
ask for leave.
Anyone who'll get caught in
posession o f dishes and cutlery...
...during a search will be punished.
Certain inmates perform their
tasks in a careless manner and...
...treat the warders
without due respect.
Good conduct is essential
in order to qualify for trans fer...
...from penitentiary ward to
the prison ward.
Those who don't meet the standards
of good conduct will be sent back.
Nobody's talking about the bath.
It's been 3 weeks.
- Tea.
- Thanks.
Come over here. He doesn't
know a thing.
Let me see. Your tooth is cracked.
I don't want anyone ill,
tired or lax, right?
It's the armies order. The convicts
must behave like convicts...
...and the guardians
like guardians.
Discipline precedes everything.
Write down all who raise difficulties.
Send those who don't work,
to the cell.
9 convicts to the coal mine.
7 to the road construction.
Agriculture 14 people. Guardian
in charge; Veli Özen.
23 to label work. Guardian
in charge: Hüseyin Sari.
3 painters. Move, move!
I repeat, I'll punish those
who violate the rules.
- Hope it's going smoothly.
- Thanks.
Good morning.
This bird's song is a good sign.
Hope so. I received no news from
home. We talked with Mr. Sabri
about the leaves.
He said "We're waiting too."
What's up boy?
Why are you so cheerful today?
Is there some good news? Am I
getting mail from home?
Good news pals! The leaves are
granted. The list is in the garden.
Good news!
The leaves are granted.
They hung the list.
Attention: The convicts who don't
return to the penitentiary...
...a fter the end of their leave will
be accepted as fugitives.
In case of disease, accident or
any incident, the convicts on leave...
...are to contact the district
attorney ship or the martial law...
...head offices and surrrender.
Any medical reports taken...
...during the leave are invalid.
Those who come late...
...will be punished, despite
medical reports and send to...
...the covered penitentiary.
The Penitentiary Directorship.
Attention! Attention!
- Thanks.
- Where to?
First Adana, then Urfa.
- Are you from Urfa?
- Yes.
- Where are you going to?
- Konya.
- Are you from Konya?
- I'm not. My wife and my kids...
...are there. With my father.
I'll gofrom here to Diyarbakir.
First I'll stop at Adana.
Look at the picture.
I look like a killer.
They'll think I'm a killer.
- What crime did you commit?
- Murder.
- You shot someone?
- Yeah.
- Why did you laugh?
- You said "I look like a killer."
Yeah. Just like a killer.
Konya passengers!
Stop there. Don't you know
it's forbidden to walk out.
I didn't know. I'm a convict.
I'm on leave.
This is my permit.
- What's this?
- My leave permit.
Leave permit? Are you a soldier?
Come with me!
It's forbidden to be on the streets
till 5 o'clock. We have martial law.
There's plenty time till 5.
Even 1 minute is too much for me.
Besides, my father is a
night watchman.
Who cares about a watchman?
We got orders. It's forbidden.
Don't waste your breath!
Don't upset them.
They'll beat you too. They
crushed to guy s heads.
- Got any cigarette?
- Yes.
- Give me one too, bro.
- Don't you have any?
They sell it on the black market,
to those who can a fford it.
Can I have one too?
- So, are you a convict?
- Yes, I am.
My son's a convict too. In Edirne.
I wanted to see him
but I missed the bus.
- Will we stay here till 5 o'clock?
- Yes.
It's the army. They don't care.
No use to object. We
don't know what to do.
Mom... Mom...
Mom...
I'm home. Your son! Seyit.
Thanks God, I could see you.
I was a fraid I wouldn't
see you again.
Seyit, my son.
- Who are you?
- Your dad got married.
What?!
Don't you know? It's been almost
two years. You have a brother now.
Where's my family?
My wife, my son?
She turned out to be dishonorable.
She disgraced us.
She left your son and ran away.
Don't you feel ashamed.
You were in jail. Your hands were
tied. Others should feel shame.
- Don't you take your things?
- Things, yes.
Go right to the bath. Take a bath
and pull youself together.
He dranktwo bottles brandy.
He also had beer.
- God! What are we going to do?
- We're splitting. I'll go to Urfa.
- Have a good leave.
- You too. I'm not going to return.
Say "Hi." to the fellows.
It's up to you.
- So you eat without me?
- Hey! Mehmet, come.
We've parted in Bursa,
but we're united again.
- Did you buy a ticket?
- No I didn't. First let's have to eat.
- That's how things are Mehmet.
- How did it happen?
One night they take them
saying for work.
- Where?
- Out of town.
- Who?
- You know.
Then they pull out
their weapons.
They execute them. The villagers
find them in the morning by chance.
He lay there covered with blood.
It was a miracle he survived.
He stay s in bed now,
for three months.
He stay s in bed now,
for three months.
It make me sad, to
see like this.
- I don't know what to say.
- I'm alive, just to spite the enemy.
How's your wife?
She's a precious person.
Very devoted and brave.
What's bothering you?
Seeing you like this...
Whatever, your situation is
much worse than mine.
At least... I'm still standing.
Tell me. We could find a way out.
We've been through many hardships.
You know, I'm married
and I've two kids.
I love my wife. I think
she loves me too.
But my father-in-law, mother-in-law
and their relatives don't want me.
I believe my wife's under
their influence.
But she did not break off me.
She say s in her last letter...
..."On the one hand my two kids...
...on the other my family."
She's undecisive.
- Why don't they want you?
- This has to stay among us.
Of course.
You remember my late
brother-in-law. Once we came here.
- One of his eyes...
- Is blind.
- I remember.
- They blame me for his death.
They say that I left
him and fled.
They say "If you hadn't fled
he wouldn't have died".
But I ran away a fter Aziz was
shot and he fell.
My wife asks me too if I were
responsible of Aziz's death.
- How did it happen?
- Let me tell you.
Aziz cam to me one day and said
"There's a job. Would you help me?"
He was going to rob a jewelery.
I was driving a cab at those times.
I did such things, from time
to time when I went broke.
But things didn't go well.
The cops shot Aziz.
If a patient expects help from his
phy sician, he has to be...
...open and honest. To give false
info, would be misleading him.
I'm not a prosecutor, nor a judge.
I'm yourfriend.
- Tell me the truth.
- I'm telling the truth.
You're ly ing. Things did not
went the way you said.
- You're right.
- Why did you feel the need to lie?
It's hard to accept it.
Mehmet!
Don't leave me Mehmet!
I got scared when I heard
the shots. I panicked.
- You could have waited.
- Were I not a fraid.
If I were not scared,
I could have waited.
If I did wait, Aziz wouldn't
get shot. He wouldn't have died.
He yelled at me a fter I moved.
He was shot long a fter
my move. I caused his death.
Thanks.
- What does your wife think?
- I told her, I would come on leave.
She wrote that she'd make
her mind a fter listening to me.
What are you going to tell her?
I don't know.
Search. Take out your ID's.
Come on!
Don't move.
Spread your legs.
Where have I put it?
I can't find it.
- It was in my pocket.
- Did if fly away?
He's a convict, just like us sir.
We're from the same dorm.
He's got no ID, no permit.
How shall I know what he is.
We went on leave together.
He's our friend.
Shut up! Don't interfere.
- What's going on?
- He's got no ID, sir.
You can leave. Move.
Bon voy age.
- I had a permit but I've lost it.
- Move.
- We went on leave together.
- I said you can leave.
We'll askthe penitentiary,
whether you're on leave or not.
You'll stay under custody,
until everything's clear.
I'm only on leave for one week.
My permit will end until you...
...find out about my situation.
Today's saturday, tomorrow sunday.
Enough! You shouldn't have
lost your papers. Take him.
Give the bird to Leyla.
She'll understand.
- She'll get what I mean.
- Don't worry. I won't forget.
Everything seems to
have changed.
There used to be a small
baklava shop here.
Hi friends. Is there any
free seat? Hi.
Surrender. I give you a last chance.
I don't want any bloodshed.
I warn you the last time.
Come out and surrender.
I'll count three. If you don't surrender
then, I'm not to blame.
I'll ruin your houses.
One...
Two...
Three.
Prepare to shoot!
Don't shoot!
We surrender.
Hold your hands above your
head and get out.
We surrender! Don't shoot.
Ömer!
You!
Turn!
You. Over here!
Your ID.
Here you are.
Search.
- Where are you going?
- To Sancak.
Your destination appears
to be Konya.
My wife and son are in Sancak. She
went to Sancak to her father because...
...she didn't know I'd come on leave.
I'm going to them.
May you recover soon, here.
- Is it like this every night?
- Yes. These are bad day s.
They search all around.
Every day a raid.
Every day a couple death.
Smuggling is dead business.
The soldiers doesn't
take any chances.
Fear is the guard
of everyone's house.
You can't even claim your
own bodies.
It's much more worse
if you're a kurd.
He should surrender. It breaks my
heart. I can't take it any longer.
I can't take it. One day they'll
bring his body.
Shut up. Allah is with him.
Won't leave him alone.
Does he have a secure place?
Which fugitive has a secure place?
Today secure, but tomorrow fucked up.
There's plenty of informers.
- I hope he won't hear your arrival.
Otherwise he can't resist.
- Heaven forbid!
- They'll shoot him if he shows up.
- Don't say it.
- The soldiers will shoot him.
- I told you not to say it!
- My bride will...
- That's enough! Enough!
Seyit.
- Such a surprise. What's up?
- I'm going to Sancak.
It was necessary.
- Did you finish your job in Adana?
- Almost.
Cigarette?
- I can't get no sleep.
- Me either.
Are you educated?
- I've finished middle school.
- I've left in the third grade.
In the primary school. I had
an uncle, who passed away...
...he alway s said "Whenever you
don't grasp something...
ask for advice. " Can someone's
own mind, be his enemy?
- Well, mine is.
- How come?
Enemy.
- Let's keep it as a secret.
- Don't you worry.
Read only this part.
We've found her in a
whorehouse in Sogukoluk.
Ve took her back to our region.
She's sentenced to death.
She y ield to temptation.
She didn't think of me, our son,
ourfamily honour.
When I was put
in jail I called her.
I said "Zine. Look.
That's the situation.
What do you say? Think about
it and let me know. " I said.
She said "It doesn't matter,
I'll wait. " she said.
"Don't you worry."
But she couldn't wait.
Why, she should have waited
And not embarass me.
Did you love her?
We grew up together.
In the same village.
She was my uncle's daughter.
I was 3-4 years older.
I had a shepheards pipe. When I
played the pipe she used to cry.
She couldn't resist.
I don't know how she y ield
to the devil. I don't get it!
I don't get it.
- Are you sure?
You've read the letter.
Her family wrote it.
Would they have written it,
if it were not true?
Would they disgrace
themselves for no reason?
What do you think? Are you
going to do what they want?
There's pity in one corner
of my heart and hatred in the other.
After all those years
there's Diy arbakir.
My poor children, my wife.
Those who love me
despite everything.
The ones who'll feel
happ y to see me.
My father-in-law, mother-in-law
and brothers-in-law.
That's weird.
This is Diy arbakir.
Finally we've arrived.
We'll part soon.
We're on the road for two
day s now. You have arrived.
I have plenty to go.
- Let's say farewell.
- Yes.
We may leave and not return,
return but not see each other.
Farewell.
I came to kiss your hand.
I don't mean to de fend my self.
I'm as sad as you.
Don't kill yourself with grie f.
I'm suffering too.
Let me kiss your hand.
Daddy. Don't leave again.
- Daddy. Don't leave again.
- Alright my daughter.
I'm telling Ahmet that
we have a father too but...
...he won't believe. You see,
we have a father too.
If you're smart you'd leave.
Don't get me in trouble.
I came to see my wife.
My kids. If you allow me...
Your kids are there.
Take them and leave.
What about my wife?
Your wife's there too. Take her
too if she wants to come.
If she's that dishonorable to
follow someone who's caused...
...her brothers death, then take her.
If she's that dishonorable...
...god damn her, she's not our
daughter. Take her.
Your husband wants to take you.
What do you say?
You goddamn dog! Coward!
You fled.
He wouldn't have died
if you hadn't ran away.
Emine, I came here for you,
for our children.
What are you saying?
Is it true? Did Aziz die
because of you?
I beg you tell me the truth.
Swear on our children.
I want to know the truth. Did you
really abandon Aziz and flee?
I want to know the truth. Did you
really abandon Aziz and flee?
You didn't run away and abandon
Aziz, did you? Answer me!
It's true. I was scared.
I fled.
Aziz died because of me,
my cowardness. That's true too but...
Don't but me. Don't you ever
dare to see us again.
We're enemies from now on!
Tickets please.
Like this.
Seyit Ali.
All three of us took the decision.
My dad, me and Cinde.
My father said, "It's not just Seyit's
honor that's been disgraced...
...It's our honor too. The girl
is ours. She's the one dishonored.
It's up to us to clean
this stain."
He said "The decision is yours.
If you say that it's our duty...
...it is ours. We'll take care
of Zinde. But if you say it's mine...
...duty, that's your business.
Think it through and decide.
I've decided already.
It was my responsibility.
I'm dishonored more than
aynone else. It is my duty.
Everything has its time.
It's the winter that worries me.
So what?
How am I supposed
to go to the village?
The winter was long this year.
The cold is terrific.
And there's fog, blizzards and
avalanche.
I'll give you my horse.
But your clothing is very thing.
You need to wear thick clothes.
You can't cross the Cobantasi pass.
You go like this,
you'll freeze to death.
- Will I?
- Yes. The pass is very windy.
You'll freeze in one hour.
Saliho's bride froze to death
just 2 day s ago. And her two kids.
You have a long way.
At least five hours. Be care ful.
Saliho's bride froze
in two hours distance.
They sweat. They got
excited and sweat.
Then they were exposed to the cold,
got stuck in the snow and fell asleep.
This will happen to you too.
This would do.
I don't need no weapon.
Take it. Just in case.
Do you have toothache?
- I can't stand the pain.
- Open your mouth.
- This one?
- Yeah.
Your tooth is cracked. The pain
will go if the burn it.
- How are you going to burn it?
- Our Barber Elim.
He knows what to do.
First you have to heat up a piece
of wire until it gets red.
Then we'll stick it into the crack
and burn your tooth.
- Can you stand the pain?
- I don't know. Is it possible?
- Are you ready?
- Yes I am.
Don't you shut your mouth or shake
your head to left or right.
Hold him tight. Don't let him move.
Hold him tight.
We'll marry as soon as I get released.
As the head of the family...
...my word counts. You'll have to
accept everything I say.
If I say it's black, you'll
know it is black.
You won't talk to men or joke
with them. I'll get mad.
You won't talk with other men
except for you brothers and closed
relatives. You'll do what I say.
You won't go against my word.
No talk of like let me put on these
and that. I'll get angry, very angry.
I will determine what you will
do and put on. Got it?
Alright. How nice you've put it.
Did you learn all these, in jail?
Who knows when we'll meet again.
Write me letters. Long. Long letters.
Send them to your new house's
adress. Don't send them to us...
...or my dad gets mad.
- He's an old fashioned man.
What age do we live in?
I just don't get it.
Who's Meral, ha? Who?
She's my fiancé. I mean,
she's going to be my wife.
Is there anything
worse than this?
This is our custom.
Don't you know how people gossip?
Who cares about them? Do I
interfere in their business?
- Don't drink, you'll get drunk.
- What's it to you?
Call those two detectives too.
Let them also interfere in my raki.
Two detectives, to watchman,
moving right behind us.
Why?
Just in case something happens?
What could have happened,
I'm asking you?
Damn you, your two detectives too.
Come in.
Come in.
Don't look. Come.
Isn't that ours?
Come baby.
- What's today?
- Friday.
Come in!
- Go to number 4.
- Number 4! I won't go to number 4.
- What's your number?
- Are you crazy or what?
He's obsessed with
numbers. Piss off.
Anything but number 4.
- I'm waiting at number 11.
- 11 is okay. Don't be late.
Don't come late, come early.
Don't come late, come early.
I'm just wondering, why did you
not go to number 4?
4 is the number of my dorm at jail.
You know what? I don't like neither
the dorm, nor the detectives. Got it?
No I didn't.
I didn't enjoy this leave at all.
How could you flee?
- What happened dad?
- Emine has run away.
Cinde.
- Father, Seyit is here.
- Let me kiss your hand.
How did you get here
in this snow and weather?
- It was pretty hard.
- How are your parents?
Fine. They've sent their regards.
- Did you talkto Sevket?
- I did.
What do you think?
The same.
Tell me... when?
I'd like to take away my wife and
son tonight if you please.
- Where?
- To Sancak. To Sevket's place.
You have something on your mind?
I have.
Did she see you?
She did.
8 month...
She's tied up there like a dog.
Her leg is chained up.
She didn't see day light for
8 month. It's forbidden.
She's forbidden anything but
bread and water.
No water touched her skin since
8 month. That's what she deserves.
Are you happ y to see me?
She wants to arouse pity for herself.
Seyit Ali, don't you grow soft on her.
Don't let your hands shake.
She's blackened the name of
our family. Don't you pity her.
I'm going to take you to your
uncle. We'll take your mom too.
- We shouldn't take her?
- Why?
She's filthy.
Your uncle said "Take Zine and
my nephew. " he said.
- Are you going to talk to Zine?
- I will.
Well. Talk. But be aware. She's devil.
Don't be taken in by her. Be brave.
Use your hatred and anger.
I'm ashamed of you Seyit.
I told you I would wait
but couldn't. What shall I say?
What's done is done.
What shall I say?
I became thinner and thinner.
What could I do?
What good would
it do if I'd say I'm sorry?
What should I weep for,
why should I complain?
What's gone is gone.
I've deserved it all.
I'm in this barn for 8 month.
Don't resemble a human anymore.
Ljust have bread and water.
But you behaved to me like a human.
You know what I think. I have no
more bread to eat, water to drink...
...in this world. They were waiting
for you, and here you are.
Don't kill me like this.
Let me take a bath, put clean
clothes on, comb my hair...
...purify my self and
do my prayer.
What else?
- I'd like to embrace my son.
- What son?
You know.
I came here to take you to Sancak
to your big brother Sevket.
I'm not going to shoot you.
May God punish you.
Whatever you say.
I know how I'll end up.
I ask from you not to hand
me over to somebody else.
Give me what I deserve.
We've shared the same bed.
My Seyit. We have a right
on each other. A marital right.
Please don't deny me my last wish.
I'm not the Seyit Ali
you used to know.
I'm not the old Seyit Ali.
I used to proud and honorable.
But now...
I don't have the nerve to
go out in public anymore.
I'm burning inside.
I asked you. You said you
could wait.
Is this how you were supposed to
wait? But I swore not to harm you.
God will punish you.
Open the door!
What the hell?!
Goodness gracious. Things have
gone dogs. You rotten shits.
Excuse me. Get out of the way!
Mommy, Daddy!
God damn you.
You infidels.
Beat them up!
Mommy! Daddy!
Beat them!
Some things are hard to tell.
They're hard to tell and
to understand.
So what? Are you going to
understand it and we're not?
That's not what I meant?
What do you mean then? You've
been busted in the loo.
Isn't this shame ful?
It's a shame for you.
For me it's necessity.
Cut it short. What necessity?
Do you have any marriage papers?
We're not officially married.
But we have kids.
How shall I know if the kids
are somone else'.
Let's hand them over to the
security forces at the first station...
...with our report. There are rules
and regulations in this country.
Let them be punished.
- Are the kids really yours?
- They are.
You should be ashamed of
your children.
Take the kids inside.
Come.
How are you going to
go out in public now?
God damn you all.
You wretch!
You should thank your children.
Otherwise I wouldn't let you go.
Don't you go out. They will tear you
to pieces. Stay where you are.
You better talkto the
people at the door.
Okay people. Return to
your places.
It's just a hastily couple.
Immorals!
You evil!
You should have dressed down.
Alright. Evil, immoral,
this and that. Break it up!
It's their own trouble.
Break it up!
Seyit said "I will take you
to Sevket."
That's what he said to us too.
"Let Zine have a bath...
...give her clean cloth and a
comb for her hair.
We'll set off when the moon rises.
So he had pity on me.
He thought it over and...
...pitied on me.
I'm a fraid. I'm a fraid.
I accustomed my self to death.
But Seyit said such things,
I don't know how to put it.
A hope grew inside me. I wasn't
Afraid of death in the past.
I wanted it. But now...
now I'm scared.
Se fer. Don't shoot.
Seyit, wake up!
The moon has risen.
Be brave my son. If you get soft
on her and your hands shake...
...I will hound you
even in the next world.
Don't forget, these two hands won't
leave you in peace.
Remove this stain from our faces.
Clean our honor.
Farewell sister. Maybe we won't
see each other again.
- You have so much right on me.
- Nobody has. May God forgive you.
I kept this for bad day s.
I don't need this anymore.
- Take it.
- I won't.
Why?
That gold has the thing
of your flesh and bone?
What thing?
You sold your flesh
for that gold.
- Forgive your rights on me.
- What's there toforgive?
May you have
a good journey.
Zine is weak and ill. She can't
endure this journey in winter.
Does she have the strength
for the way?
She's ill, her clothes are thin.
She'll freeze and cause them trouble.
Let her freeze and die.
You can't cross the
Cobantasi Pass like this.
- If you go like this, you'll freeze.
- I'll freeze?
You'll freeze. The pass is pretty
windy. It will freeze a man instantly.
Saliho's bride froze two day s
ago. And two of her kids.
You have a long way ahead.
At least five hours.
Oh my God.
Give me strength.
Don't leave me here.
Give me strength.
That's the Syrian border. The border
is stuffed up with barb wires, mines.
Those mines have blew apart my
fathers and hundreds of villagers...
...limbs and heads. The borders which
are the grave of hundreds of villagers.
The Syrian teritory is just
But you can't go. Because you can't
explain your situation.
Nobody wants to understand you.
They say go, finish your sentence.
Abuzer is a fugitive, you're a fugitive.
They say, what are we going to do.
I wish I knew. I can't accept it
anymore. I'm fed up being depressed.
They want to wed you. They say
you'd be docile when you get married.
But they got no money.
I won't marry. I don't want to
leave a widow behind me.
Halil, I saw a girl when I came here.
I know her but I'm not sure. Her nose...
That's Müslüm's daughter.
Her name is Gülbahar.
She's a strong girl. She was a kid
when you were put in jail.
- What's that father?
- A horse carcass.
I'm worn out.
Oh God, give me strength.
Seyit!
Seyit!
Don't leave me here.
Seyit!
Dady!
What?
- My mom lags behind.
- She'll catch up.
But she can't. She's shouting.
Seyit! Save me!
You wished she wouldn't
have come with us.
You brought her.
Then you shouldn't have.
I don't feel my legs!
I can't walk.
My legs don't move!
Saliho's bride froze
in two hours distance.
They sweat. They got
excited and sweat.
Then they were exposed to the cold,
got stuck in the snow and fell asleep.
My legs... My legs...
They don't carry
me anymore.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Forgive me. I can't
look you in the face.
Forgive me. Forgive me.
Don't let the beasts feed on me here.
I'm willing to be your slave.
My hands... My hands...
I don't feel my hands.
My hands!
My hands!
I'm dy ing Seyit.
I'm dy ing.
Forgive me. Forgive me.
I'm ashamed of you. Forgive
your rights on me.
You were a very good man. You
used to play the pipe so nice.
I wept when you played.
Zine! Zine! Wake up!
Wake up! Don't fall asleep Zine.
If you sleep, you'll freeze.
Don't sleep. Zine!
Wake up. Zine wake up.
Don't fall asleep.
Zine wake up. Don't sleep. Zine.
Get up Zine. Get up.
Zine, don't sleep.
Don't sleep.
Zine don't sleep!
Get up!
Mirza. Hit your mom so
she won't sleep. Hit her!
Hit her!
What's up?
Are you Sevket?
- Your sister?
- My sister.
She froze to death.
My condolences.
- My father?
- Heaven forbid! I hope it's not him.
My father?
My father?
God knows. We can't know.
I hope it's not him.
Friends, this country is our country.
We have no differences.
Yesterday night there was a
clash at the border.
You must have heard the shots.
Yet we were not able tofind
any papers for identification.
Look at the dead, whether you
know them or not.
We're going to give the corpses
to their relatives.
Look and tell us if you know them.
The corpses are in the truck.
Look at them.
We're sorry too.
But law is law. That's what happens
to those who break the laws.
Cooperate. Look at the corpses and
tell us whether you know them.
You'll be punished if you
know them and don't tell us.
Do you know them?
No. I don't know any one.
- Is there anyone you know?
- No.
- Is there anyone you know?
- No.
Get out.
My condolences. You know,
I'm your husband know.
That's the code.
Seyit!
Don't let the beasts feed on me.
Save me!
Seyit!

My father-in-law, mother-in-law
and brothers-in-law.
Those who hate me.
That's weird. This is Diy arbakir.
