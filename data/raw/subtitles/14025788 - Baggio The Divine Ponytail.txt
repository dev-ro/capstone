Baggio is totally focused
as he approaches the penalty spot.
He's positioning the ball.
Everyone is staring.
The stadium goes silent.
Baggio steps back.
Baggio takes a shot!
Who is Roberto Baggio?
Well, I was born 17 years ago
in Caldogno, where I still live now.
NETFLIX PRESENTS
I started playing soccer
when I was two or three years old.
I was always carrying
the ball around the house.
And in these last five years
I've been playing with Vicenza.
People are saying
good things about you, hey.
Yes, yes, I know
people say good things about me.
And at 17, how does it feel?
Well, I'm happy.
This is already amazing,
but it's...
important to prove that on the pitch.
Is Vicenza too small for you?
No, I'm fine here.
When will you make the big leap?
The clubs will have to make that decision.
Now we need to win this championship.
So let's hope this is the year.
Come on!
Dinner's on the table!
On my way.
Eddy, hurry up!
Nadia, come and help mum.
Coming.
Eddy, call Walter.
He's still talking
to his girlfriend on the phone.
♪ You are my dream come true ♪
- Walter, dinner's ready.
- ♪ That's what you are ♪
- Roby, is what's in the newspaper true?
- Yes, but you don't say anything.
- I'll tell them later.
- Tell them, please!
Ugh!
Please, can you give it to me!
- Dinner's ready?
- Of course it's ready!
Rice and peas.
Go and wash your hands.
Did you wash your hands?
- Yes. Calm down.
- You're making my head spin.
- I can't hear myself think!
- Okay, I'll bring the wine.
Well, what's all this ruckus!
Finally.
Well then?
Eddy, tell Daddy what you got in History.
I got a B.
Good boy!
Daddy, I went to the market with Mum.
They didn't have the cheese you asked for.
But we found the one you like.
- Daddy, I'm out later, hey.
- And I'm going to talk to Sandro.
He said that they're not hiring now,
but maybe in the future.
I signed with Fiorentina.
For 2.7 billion liras.
Mother of God!
When were you planning
on telling us this, dear?
Uh, well, I was waiting
for Dad to come home.
- They'll give all the money to you, then?
- Well, no.
No, they give it to Vicenza, but, uh...
I will be given a salary.
- A good one.
- Great.
Well, you can pay me back for the windows
you broke in the workshop.
It's not like he practices penalties
in his bedroom.
Anyway,
I can still come back now and then,
to come and help you out in the workshop.
With what Fiorentina is paying you,
you should focus on earning instead.
Do you even care that I'm in the Serie A?
- What am I meant to say? Bravo?
- Yeah. Would it kill you?
As far as I'm concerned,
you're all the same.
Even if you earn more,
you're no better than your brother
who's busting his ass at the factory.
And if you stand there waiting for someone
to say "Good job" at every turn,
trust me, you won't go far.
You must focus on the work and fly low.
And what do you know about aiming high?
I had eight children.
Eight.
And fed everyone.
I couldn't go off racing bikes
and leave your mother to look after you.
Ah, so it's our fault
you didn't become the next Eddy Merckx.
If you carry on talking,
you're going to scare the ducks away.
See what happens when you fly low?
Come! Go get it.
Roby!
They're going to start training
without you if you don't hurry up.
Careful. You'll hurt yourself.
So you'll come with me to Florence?
Yeah, right. Sure.
But what about all my school work?
There are schools there, too, you know?
I'm not sure they're going to let me.
Insist, then.
If you insist...
sooner or later...
My dad would have a heart attack for sure.
Shouldn't we start walking?
You see? You give up too easily.
Look.
- Come on. Let's go.
- See what happens when you insist?
- Go.
- Ready?
Yes.
MAY 5TH 1985 RIMINI-VICENZA
How does it feel to be
the best paid 18-year-old in all of Italy?
Well, it's a big responsibility, hey.
These are the last games
you play in Serie C.
Don't be too ruthless
against us, will you?
- What did he want?
- Who, Sacchi?
Ah, nothing.
He's scared I'll score against him.
Make sure you do.
Come on!
- Pass!
- Get the ball!
Anterior cruciate, capsule,
meniscus, and collateral.
We made a hole
in the head of the tibia with a drill.
Then we cut the tendon,
we had it passing inside the hole,
we pulled it up,
and secured it with 220 stitches.
Two hundred and twenty?
When will I be able to play again?
When will I be able to play again?
Just focus on getting better.
I'll come by later to see how it's going.
Mum.
Tell me everything, sweetheart.
Mum's here.
If you love me, kill me.
What are you saying, Roby?
Don't say such things.
It's not a joke.
Don't even think about it.
Oh, Baggio.
So, you made it.
Good morning.
Welcome.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Give me that. Give me that.
Well, thank you for bringing him here.
Thanks for having him,
even in this current state.
Ah, well, come on now.
Nice and slow, right?
- Roby, I'll wait for you inside.
- Yes.
- Well, thank you. Goodbye
- Goodbye.
The 1970 World Cup,
in the final. Italy versus Brazil.
We lost 4-1.
I was there, broken.
And you came to me,
and you said to me,
"I will win the World Cup
against Brazil for you.
I promise you."
Do you remember?
How is it possible?
We're in the finals for once.
Couldn't we play well just once? No?
Brazil has won the World Cup.
Dad, I was only three.
How could I remember?
Listen.
This injury is the best thing
that's ever happened to you.
You thought you reached the top
and all of a sudden you lost everything.
Don't take anything for granted in life.
No one gives you anything for free.
You're lucky
you found out so early in life.
So lucky.
We'll see.
Roby!
Listen, Roby, there seems to be a problem
with your salary.
What?
Well, it seems as though
it's not been cashed yet.
- Did the company send the checks to you?
- No.
I never played. I mean,
you're paying me to do nothing.
Oh, Roberto,
you're not the first injured player
in the history of football. Come on.
Go and cash those checks, for God's sake.
And cheer up, will you? Hey?
Come on, cheer up.
Do you need help?
Yeah.
Any chance they've released a new album?
The Eagles? No, sorry.
This is the third time you've come here
asking for the same thing.
You do realise they haven't released
a new album since 1979.
Baggio, are you all right?
How do you know my name?
You really think I wouldn't recognize
Viola's great hope?
- Ah, yeah, such a great hope.
- Hey!
What are you talking about?
- Everybody here says that you're...
- Yeah.
- I'm predestined. I...
- Predestined.
Maurizio.
Roby.
Look, if it's okay with you,
I'd like to give you something
that helped me feel so much better.
Have you ever heard of Buddhism?
Why are you laughing?
You see,
I had the same reaction initially,
but then, I began walking the path,
and changed my life.
"The Human Revolution."
Mm-hmm.
And, I'll give you my address.
So, if you'd like...
...you can come over now and then,
so that we can practice together.
What do you say?
Huh?
Okay. Maybe next time, huh?
When The Eagles release a new album.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
JANUARY 1ST 1988
Nine, eight, seven, six...
...five, four, three, two...
...one! Happy New Year!
Yes.
Happy New Year, my love!
Hello?
What's happening?
I quit, Andre.
I feel so bad.
- I'm coming back to Caldogno.
- No, but, wait, I don't understand.
Mum, would you turn the TV down please?
They want to transfer me to Pescara.
In Serie B.
Do you know what that means?
Come on. I'll come home.
We can be together.
Are you still there?
Listen, Roby.
You survived an injury
that someone else by now...
Did I Andre?
I played two games in two years.
Yeah, and you scored
a goal against Maradona.
Everyone here remembers it, you know?
And your father told me
that you promised
you would win the World Cup for him.
Is that the true story?
I can't stand anymore.
You have to keep going.
If you don't give up, sooner or later...
You taught me that.
Anyway, I insisted,
and I convinced my dad at last.
I'll be moving in with you soon.
- You mean it?
- Yes.
Don't beat yourself up.
The only thing you need is...
the strength to carry on.
That's all, you know?
Happy New Year, my love.
Bye.
Baggio?
Come on, baby. Just be patient.
He's a friend in need.
He's really in a state.
Come on, baby.
You can't always be like this!
Don't get pissed!
Am I intruding?
No, it doesn't matter. She'll get over it.
Right!
Let's start. Easy half an hour,
just to get the hang of it.
- Well, that doesn't sound like very much.
- Too little?
No? I mean,
we could practice for an hour or two.
I mean,
I have nothing to do the whole day.
Nothing to do the whole day.
Well, we'll keep on going
till you're enlightened. Come on.
- Who's that guy?
- Daisaku Ikeda.
My sensei and my master.
- So, do you need to speak Japanese?
- No, doesn't matter.
With time, you will understand
that enlightened minds
can communicate in other ways.
Well, so, how does it, uh, all work, then?
So, read here.
This is old Chinese.
- Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.
- Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.
- Bravo.
- What does it mean?
It means,
the fundamental mystic law of life.
And if I repeat this sentence every day,
will it make me feel better, then?
I mean,
you have to commit yourself a little.
This is no "hocus pocus."
You have to focus on your objectives,
elevate your vital condition,
clean your karma.
What is it I'm cleaning?
- Your karma.
- What's that?
Karma is the sum
of all of your actions, you see?
So, it's a bit like a, uh,
criminal record.
Yeah, well, not really, but...
If you behave in a good manner,
your karma is clean. If you behave poorly...
- It's dirty.
- Exactly.
Okay, but I think my karma's clean enough.
I never hurt anyone.
I mean, except a few ducks while hunting.
Here you go. Listen up.
Take that. Come on.
Two over here.
This one, like this.
Perfect. Very good. Come on.
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
nam-myoho-renge-kyo, nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
nam-myoho-renge-kyo, nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
nam-myoho-renge-kyo, nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
nam-myoho-renge-kyo, nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
nam-myoho-renge-kyo, nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
nam-myoho-renge-kyo, nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
nam-myoho-renge-kyo...
No. Serious, serious.
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
nam-myoho-renge-kyo, nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
nam-myoho-renge-kyo, nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
nam-myoho-renge-kyo, nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
nam-myoho-renge-kyo, nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
nam-myoho-renge-kyo...
The important thing
that you must understand
is that it all depends on you.
Your life is in your own hands.
You are the one
who determines your existence.
You determine your future.
So, you focus on a specific target,
you write it down,
you visualize it clearly,
and then you put
all your energy into it, Roby.
And please believe me,
if you don't commit,
things won't just happen on their own.
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, nam-myo...
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo...
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo...
- It's okay.
- Thank you for everything, Roberto
Bye. Thank you.
At the 1970 World Cup, in the final,
Italy versus Brazil,
we lost 4-1.
And you came to me,
and you said to me,
"I will win the World Cup
against Brazil for you."
Do you remember?
You made me better looking
than I actually am.
- You're such an idiot.
- You're getting better and better.
Why don't you do it for real?
Sure. Come on. Drawing is not a job.
While kicking a ball around is?
What's that got to do with it?
You're talented.
Oh, no, no.
You're just lacking a bit of confidence.
That's all.
Actually, you know,
there is one thing that might help you.
Well, at least, it helps me.
For the last two months,
I've been praying.
What, you mean mass?
I've become a Buddhist.
You're not being serious.
I'm deadly serious.
What, you mean it, Roby?
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.
So you pray to Buddha?
Two hours a day.
One in the morning, one in the evening,
in front of the Gohonzon...
Two hours a day?
You must be mad.
But why is that?
Well, because...
You told me yourself that I needed to find
the strength to go on.
And I'm finding it.
Roby, that's a sect, for sure.
Look, babe,
they're just trying to steal your money.
Look at me and tell me,
am I better or worse?
♪ Yeah, it really hurts, you know ♪
♪ If I see that you never look at me ♪
♪ Yeah, and I keep wondering
If some day you could go out with me ♪
♪ Yeah, you're always laughing now ♪
♪ You're always laughing
when I talk to you ♪
♪ Oh, yeah, you say that you don't know
If you love me the way that I love you ♪
♪ I swear that it's true,
I swear that it's true ♪

NATIONAL TEAM CALL-UP
Hmm.
I should have specified.
I meant a credible objective.
Why isn't it credible?
I mean...
They're sending you down to B. That's it.
And I actually played it down.
Why?
What did you want to write?
Winning the World Cup against Brazil.
Tomorrow half past six, then?
Yes, and thank you for coming.
And you? What's your aim in life?
Maybe you wanted to become
a famous drummer.
Bravo. Keith Moon.
From The Who.
And what went wrong?
Nothing. Why?
Well, it seems that just...
- No, it's...
- Listen.
Keith Moon died at 32. An overdose.
Who do you think is doing better now,
him or me?
What the world gives you
is not what makes you happy, Roby.
- Well, I still want to win the World Cup.
- Good.
You will have to practice a lot, then.
Oh, Baggio, I was looking for you.
They're waiting for you in Pescara.
What do you mean, Pescara?
I thought the deal was off.
The National Team, Roby.
What don't you understand?
You've been called up
for the friendly game against Norway
in Pescara, 19th of October.
Get dressed quickly. La Domenica Sportiva
is expecting an interview.
- With me?
- No, with me. Come on, get going.
6 YEARS LATER
...the highlight of the day
is Roberto Baggio's personal success,
as he was awarded the Ballon d'Or of 1993
by French magazine France Football,
an award assigned
to the best player of the year.
Good evening,
dear listeners!
USA WORLD CUP 1994
I'm coming to you live
from the Giants Stadium
in New Jersey, near New York,
where Italy is about to embark
on its adventure in USA 1994.
In a few minutes,
the Azzurri will face Éire,
the Irish Republic,
in their first match of the World Cup.
Come on!
I bet on Italy in the finals.
Come on, kids! Get to your seats.
- Hurry up!
- It just has to settle.
Italy! Italy! Italy!
Come on, love.
Enough with the cards already.
The game's about to begin.
Come on, put them away. Come on!
♪ Italy called, yes! ♪
ITALY - IRELAND 0-1
One touch.
One touch.
I receive the ball and pass.
One touch and pass. One touch and pass.
But no. We were too stretched, weren't we?
So, instead of being here, here, and here,
and here, what did we do?
We let them find us here.
We knew Ireland
was far stronger physically, right?
How long did we study them for?
Two months.
We studied them for two months.
And then we still allowed them to...
We played their game
instead of playing ours.
A touch! A touch!
Coach?
How can I beat an opponent
with just a single touch of the ball?
What do you mean, Roberto?
If every time I touch the ball
I need to pass it straight away,
then how can I make use
of my skills in dribbling?
Everyone come watch the video.
We're going to watch the match again.
Except you.
Come here.
You're aware that you're not playing
like in the qualifiers?
I'm in the wrong role, coach.
I don't know what to say.
I'm feeling cut out of the game like this.
And we lost against Ireland.
- I know.
- But...
Look, Roberto,
you need to stay calm, okay?
You have to put your trust in me.
Because you see, for us,
you're like Maradona for Argentina.
You're fundamental.
Would you ask Maradona to play one touch?
It will be a true test
for our national team.
They need to make everyone forget
the bitter taste
of the match against Ireland.
...again for Baresi.
Falls short.
The captain manages to free himself.
- Come on, come on! Go!
- He gets closer to the...
He kicks!
That's all right anyway.
...the outside
of the right foot...
Pass for Baresi. No luck...
Bjørnebye, Rushfeldt... Oh, watch out!
We find our defence unprepared.
and Pagliuca...
- No!
- That was a penalty.
- Yeah, outside the box.
- ...the opposing player...
...is sent off!
Come on! Really! This is no good!
Pagliuca sent off...
He needs to replace a forward, of course.
- But what the bloody hell happened?
- They've sent off Pagliuca!
No!
I can't believe it.
Why are they taking off Roby?
Did he take Roby off?
What do you mean, Baggio?
...Baggio is asking,
"Who, me?"
He's crazy.
Did he say, "He's crazy"?
- He what?
- He said that Sacchi is crazy.
I don't like the way this is going.
It's not good.
Baggio's expression.
Then Sacchi.
- They pulled out a Ballon d'Or. Bye!
- ...Marchegiani.
You wanted to see me, coach?
ITALY - NORWAY 1-0
Come, come.
What did you say when I took you off?
That I'm crazy?
On global TV?
You think
you can make me look like an idiot
in front of a billion people?
Well, let me tell you a secret.
The fact was you looked stupid.
You proved to the world
you're immature and arrogant.
You told me
I was fundamental, coach, remember?
You're all the same to me.
And if I'm down a man,
I think about winning the game,
not about protecting
the player's sensibility. Get it?
And by the way, yes, I'm crazy.
I'm really crazy, yeah.
If you're not crazy, you wouldn't even try
to change Italian football.
You can go.
I'll see you tomorrow at 5 a.m.
We still need to practice moves
without the ball.
We're still lacking precision. Okay?
We're a disaster!
The referee blows the whistle.
It's over, 1-1.
- He didn't do anything!
- Useless match.
Ah, useless! Useless!
The real issue
is the pressing in midfield.
No, it's this Sacchi
who doesn't let them play.
ITALY-MEXICO 1-1
So, you're all experts now?
Sacchi won everything,
he knows what he's doing.
Sacchi...
The kid looks totally inconsolable.
I think he needs us.
He needs his family.
...and they're hoping
for a repechage.
We should go there.
If there's a repechage,
we're going to go.
Right, Florindo?
All right.
Mr. Agnelli,
the owner of Juventus,
said that Baggio looked like
a wet bunny against Mexico.
A tough remark
for the most anticipated player
of the national team
and the most pampered of Juventus.
♪ Shakedown 1979 ♪
♪ Cool kids never have the time ♪
♪ On a live wire
right up off the street... ♪
- Look who's there.
- Where were you? It's almost noon.
A disaster. We got lost.
That stupid taxi driver gave us a tour
of all of New Jersey.
I know it better than Caldogno.
Your father can get in arguments
over here, too, that's for sure.
- Oh, my darling.
- I love you, Dad!
Oh, baby, I love you, too.
- Hello, my love.
- Hi.
How are you?
Well, how am I?
I'm good now. I feel good.
Where are the bags?
- That guy over there took them.
- He told us to put them in that trolley.
This is really happening, isn't it?
Albertini!
Donadoni!
Ball to Massaro!
What fucking ball?
There's no ball.
The Nigerian team is faster
and more physical.
And so we really need to forget
all about the repechage.
Our World Cup begins now.
We're in the knockout stage
of the World Cup.
And...
we're Italy.
We're in the round of 16.
This is a direct elimination round.
The winner will continue.
The loser will be sent home.
Italians have always played football
the same way as they fought wars.
Shooting only after we have seen
the opponent has made a mistake.
Ah!
For God's sake, referee!
He should get a yellow card.
He should really get a yellow card.
Is this the Italy you want to be, hey?
A nation that has no new ideas,
unable to change?
No! We fail every time because we think
exclusively about ourselves.
So, I want you now to become a team,
not just 11 players.
Carlo, the line-up, please.
Marchegiani.
Mussi,
Maldini, Costacurta, Benarrivo.
Donadoni, Berti, Albertini.
Baggio Roberto
and Massaro.
High corner...
The ball... Goal!
No!
In the confusion, Maldini...
What a bummer. I'm going home.
Yekini seems to be
the one who scored.
Let's watch the replay.
A few minutes to the end.
This is heartbreaking.
Come on, Roberto.
They are trying again.
Watch out!
Pass to Baggio.
Roberto Baggio scores a goal
at the 43rd minute of the second half.
Roberto Baggio brings Italy back!
Roberto Baggio.
It looked like it was over.
You see that, guys.
I told you, he's got past it.
Lob for Benarrivo.
Goal! Penalty! Penalty!
Calm down! Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.
It's a penalty, not a goal.
- Nope.
- How long is left now?
Moments of great emotion
and great anxiety.
At the eleventh minute
of the first extra time,
Roberto Baggio against Rufai.

ITALY - BULGARIA 2-1
I'm not missing the Brazil final
even if it kills me.
- It was hot in the stadium.
- Yeah.
I noticed.
Hundred degrees, 100 percent humidity.
No wonder you're hurting.
I made you a promise, you know?
What do you mean?
When I was three.
The final against Brazil.
You promised you were going to win.
You haven't won yet.
What are we doing?
We'll do some shots.
- Here?
- Yeah.
I want to test that leg.
Harder.
Put all your strength into it.
Again.
Again.
Again.
- Enough already!
- No!
- Do you even want me to play in the final?
- Yeah, but I want to see if you can.
Maybe you're hoping I'll get injured
so that I won't be able to play, huh?
What did you say?
If you win the World Cup without me,
you'll be able to take the credit,
but if I play and overshadow you,
it won't be a clear Sacchi,
it'll be a clear Baggio.
Let's get this clear. You think
I want you to get injured on purpose?
I don't believe it.
I've found someone more paranoid than me.
Look, I'm going on to that field.
If I don't play well, you can take me off.
Good evening from TG1.
The Italian National Team beat
Bulgaria 2-1 as you've all seen.
...in Italy
big screens are positioned
in schools and on the streets.
...with the most savage fans
in the fountains of the square,
and we can hear all around us
a thundering choir of people honking...
THE FINAL
Italia! Italia! Italia!
Italia! Italia! Italia! Italia!
Italia! Italia! Italia! Italia...
Your whole life you dream
about playing against Brazil
in the World Cup final.
And when that dream becomes reality,
the referee whistles
the end of the 90 minutes,
and it feels like you didn't play at all.
"Nil-nil, draw," says the board.
But you don't remember a thing,
as if your brain
didn't register any of it.
Extra time begins,
and it runs out in a second.
Time ends up in a black hole.
And the whistle from Puhl.
The 15th World Cup,
for the first time ever,
will be awarded in a penalty shoot-out.
And before you know it,
penalty kicks have fallen
into that black hole, too.
Time has been sucked away.
You don't understand where you are,
what's happening.
All you know is on that scoreboard.
Dunga.
Goal.
Amo Dunga!
And then, all of a sudden,
the black hole that swallowed time
spits it out again.
What was very fast
becomes slow, almost still.
Suddenly, every second
seems to last a lifetime.
And when time doesn't follow the rules,
the present and the past are blurred.
Brazil is in the lead.
Roberto Baggio will shoot
our last penalty kick.
We still have
a faint hope.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the champion of the 1994 World Cup
is about to be revealed.
Goal! Goal!
Beautiful penalty kick by Roberto Baggio.
And Italy are the World Champions!
All of his teammates are surrounding him.
The whole stadium is cheering
and screaming his name.
Roberto Baggio! Roberto Baggio!
Roberto Baggio!
Goal!
Goal!
6 YEARS LATER
What's wrong with it?
Nothing. It's just old and tired.
It doesn't bear fruit. One of these days
I'll have to cut it down.
Are you a gardener now?
I'm unemployed.
Soon they'll have to cut me down, too.
But the Japanese wanted you.
How much did they offer?
Fourteen billion.
Fourteen billion liras a small sum to you?
Why are you still here?
I'd rather stay here.
You're still thinking about the World Cup.
Don't you understand
that nobody wants you here?
Not even at Vicenza.
I heard, you know.
What's the matter with you,
pissing off the coaches?
You'd have to ask them.
I'm not doing anything wrong.
I just want to play.
No. I'm asking you.
You must be partly to blame, huh?
I must threaten them.
I don't know what else to say.
I'm not a pain in the ass.
I train, I meditate, end of.
There. Your "practice."
Couldn't it be
that this whole Buddhism thing hurt you?
- I'm just asking.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
Careful. If you keep doing weird things,
they'll think of you as an outsider,
and people won't trust you.
You're thinking of yourself,
not as part of a team.
There you go.
You said it. You finally said it.
Still going with the old story,
"Baggio is not a team player."
Give me a break, will you?
That's just bullshit
that coaches came up with
to get rid of me.
I only know you always wanted
to overshadow your brothers.
Who, me?
You were the one who always treated me
worse than the others,
instead of believing in me
once in your life.
Listen, you're the one who has to believe
in yourself, not the others.
Had you believed a little more,
you wouldn't have missed that penalty.
I can't believe I've been so stupid.
Anyway, thank you for reminding me, huh?
Penalty again?
How the fuck did I miss it?
I've never shot a penalty kick
so high in my life. Ever.
Do you know what I think, Roby?
I think that everyone loves you so much
because you lost that World Cup.
Because you showed them that you're human,
that you make mistakes, that you suffer.
Like everyone else.
I'm going out for a walk.
Don't worry. Go back to sleep.
Vittorio, I'm sorry about the time.
Am I bothering you?
What did you have written
in your notebook as your first goal?
I wrote so many. I...
But Roby, the important thing is the path.
The real goals,
you discover them along the way.
Why are you asking me this?
Because you're my friend, you know,
not just my manager.
Of course I'm your friend.
Or I would never have driven 120 miles
at 5:30 a.m. to get here.
I want to go to Japan.
Did you change your mind?
Do you want to accept the offer?
No.
In two years,
the World Cup in Japan and Korea.
I want to be there with the Azzurri.
I understand what you're saying
about the path, believe me.
But I really should be there,
wearing that shirt.
This is why I'm here, Roby.
The thing is
I don't have a team, Vittorio.
- I won't be called without a team.
- I'll find you one. Fuck!
There must be someone out there
who hasn't gone mad yet.
Just like that scene
in Forrest Gump,
where people start running behind him,
here is Roby Baggio
with an entire town running beside him.
Since he came back to train at home,
this scene repeats itself every day.
A collective rite, very emotional.
The champion is back
into the arms of his native town.
- Gino?
- The kids of Caldogno...
- Ginetto?
- What is it?
Excuse me, but since you have a team
of crappy players,
why don't you get Baggio?
You do know he doesn't have a team?
How long will this last?
Is Roberto Baggio's career really over?
Thank you for meeting me. I appreciate it.
As you know, we've been through
a few complicated situations
with some of the coaches.
Everything that Roby represents,
his values,
the great love that people have for him...
- Well, for some people it's a problem.
- You think I don't know that?
Some of my colleagues
are real drama queens.
But I understand you.
You're at your best
when you're the centre of the squad.
Those situations, there's no debate.
Well...
I just need to feel
that I have people's trust
like, uh, like anyone.
Here in Brescia, we trust you.
And we don't have to win the league,
of course, just not be relegated.
Will you save us, then?
Well, we can try.
I realize
that this is quite an articulate draft,
but what matters to me
is protecting the man,
not just the player.
You have to remember, Mr. President...
So, explain to me,
what's so special about Buddhism?
Well, nothing. I'm a Buddhist.
Well, your manager is Buddhist.
Your wife is Buddhist, hey?
You know you won't be able to convert me.
Well, my wife was even more sceptical
than you at the beginning, you know?
But you go hunting.
Which Buddhism is surely against, right?
No, well...
When I was little, I used to go hunting
to be with my father.
So your father wasn't around, then?
Well, he was always working and...
and he had seven other children,
not just me.
Thing is,
I've seen a lot of players in my time,
and they're all the same in the end.
They tend to see
their coach as their father.
That's why you've always had
so many problems with them.
You wanted all the love for yourself.
It's understandable, with seven siblings.
Well...
I don't know about that.
Relax. As long as I'm here
the only game plan is that
everyone passes the ball to Baggio,
and you score a goal.
How about that for a plan?
What is it?
Oh, nothing. We're just happy.
About what?
That you're playing with us.
We still can't believe it.
Come on. Let's play, then!
- Yeah! Let's go!
- We might even win this! What do you say?
And, Roberto, make me smile!
CAPTAIN BAGGIO
BAGGIO IS THE CAPTAIN
BRESCIA IS REBORN
- ...to Mazzone!
- To Mazzone!
Roberto Baggio wins once again
against one of his former teams.
BAGGIO'S MASTERPIECE
BAGGIO SAVES BRESCIA
With Baggio,
the race for the UEFA Cup begins.
THE FANS LOVE HIM
Brescia has never been
such a beautiful team.
Roberto, warm up. Come on, now.
BAGGIO SCORES!
DIVINE HAT TRICK
BRESCIA FINISHES
IN EIGHT PLACE
Roby! Roby! Roby! Roby! Roby! Roby!
Roby! Roby! Roby! Roby! Roby!
Coach! Coach!
Brescia! Brescia! Brescia!
Brescia! Brescia! Brescia...
JANUARY 2002
I've been following you.
You're in good shape.
He almost looks like
the Baggio I used to train.
I feel good, coach.
I'd like to thank Mazzone.
You know what they say, Giovanni.
Mazzone is the poor man's Trapattoni.
No, Carletto would say
that I'm a rich man's Mazzone.
That's true.
Uh, you want me to say
I'll call you for the World Cup?
It's in six months, Roby.
That's a long way off.
I know. I understand completely.
I just want you
to take me into consideration
when you make your decisions.
Giovanni, you know that...
this is the last World Cup for Roby.
But if he keeps playing like this, I mean...
Well then, if you're fine, I'll call you.
I guarantee you.
This, though,
is all I can possibly say to you.
Good enough.
Come, Mum, come here.
Yes, honey, I'm coming.
Stay still just for one more second.
Stay put a second.
- I told you to stay where you were.
- Mum?
- Yeah?
- Dad is injured.
Hi.
Hi, Andre.
How's he doing?
I spoke with the surgeon. He says
that he wants to see him in the morning.
No.
Why not?
He says...
...that he doesn't want to get
another surgery.
He can't... do it anymore.
So what's all this about?
It's over, Vin. Enough.
And you'll tell this to Master Ikeda?
And say what?
That you're giving up
on the World Cup in Japan, his home.
Roby, this is your World Cup.
FIFA increased the players to 23.
Fuck, you know they did it for you, hey?
I'm too old to get another surgery.
You had your face in the mud, Roby,
when you got hurt.
This is the image the world has seen.
The whole world saw it.
Baggio crying, his face in the mud.
I don't know if you're fine with it.
I'm not.
So, you'll pick yourself up,
you'll fight,
and even if only for a minute,
you'll play.
That's what we'll do.
This is the image we will give,
Baggio, on the pitch, standing up,
his head held high.
The surgery took an hour and a half.
We reconstructed the cruciate ligament,
and we removed the meniscus.
How did it go?
In six months,
you'll be back on the pitch.
I can do it in three months.
What's he doing?
When your dad decides
he wants to do something,
he becomes completely crazy, you see?
Come on. Let's go get him
before he injures himself again.
Roby, please. Come in, will you?
Roby, now.
- No, no, I can do it.
- No, I'm serious.
- No, I'm walking.
- No, it's way too soon. You know it.
- All right. I'll lean on you, then.
- All right.
Vale! Come here, would you, please?
Mattia!
I'll give you three steps.

He's coming back to the field

So, why are you out here, then?
- ...177 days is not that long.
- And you?
Look...
I can't even bring myself to watch him.
If he gets hurt again, then...
He's got it into his head that he wants

He's as stubborn

MAY 2002
Everything was out of the ordinary.
Pep gave you the captain's armband,
and that's no protocol, hey.
He couldn't do that.
Then, in 20 minutes, two goals.
First, an overhead kick,
right in the top corner.
- Oh, my word.
- The second was easy.
I could've done it myself.
Even Mattia could've done that.
But the thing is, it wasn't a rebound.
It was actually
the ball declaring its undying love
to the predestination...
Who is it?
It's Trap.
Hello, Coach.
I'm good, thanks.
But you told me that, uh...
Yes, it's clear.
Yeah, yeah, thank you.
Roby?
They've been playing me for a fool.
"If you feel fine, I'll call you."
"If you feel fine,
I'll call you."
What more could I have fucking done?
What more could I have done,
for fuck's sake!
Nothing. Couldn't have done anything.
You did all that was humanly possible
and then some.
It only took you 77 days
to get back in the game.
Giovanni made a mistake.
He doesn't understand you're a symbol.
A symbol.
I can't believe it. I... can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you...
Shall we hold
a press conference, Roby?
What are you doing?
Roby.
Roby.
Roby, just stop, hey.
Roby!
You were right, you know?
It's the path.
The path.
You're not even that angry.
I'd be out of my mind
over something like this.
Anger is useless.
Who said that, then? Buddha?
I'm sorry.
I promised you I'd win the World Cup.
You were three years old.
And you were sleeping.
You never saw Italy-Brazil.
You mean, I never made you that promise?
No.
Tell me you're kidding.
So, why'd you say it, then?
Because you had something I never had.
Talent.
I didn't stop racing because of you.
It's 'cause
I was mediocre, period.
You, on the other hand,
you had a gift, one in a million.
But you were lacking a goal,
something to push you forward
in a difficult situation.
So I gave you something to aim for.
For fuck's sake.
So, you're telling me that...
that story that you told me,
and on which
I only happen to base my whole life,
you made it all up, then?
I was afraid you didn't have character.
I thought you were fragile.
Sometimes it looked like you played
just to hear people say you were good.
Look, if that was your only goal...
Come on.
Come here, or you'll scare the ducks.
Right now,
I have a strong urge to shoot you, yeah?
Just be careful not to aim too high again.
Oh, go fuck yourself.
And in the end, this World Cup wasn't...
Gone.
You have something better.
Know what it is?
People love you.
I know I wasn't the father you wanted,
but I had to prepare you for life.
Look, it's never easy for people like us,
who have nothing.
Yes, Dad, I understand, but...
"But." Well, there's always a "but", Roby.
I did what I could
with what I knew.
Then again,
I'm sure I've done something good.
And I can finally tell you.
What are you going to tell me now?
That you're not my father?
That I'm proud of you.
