Hanif! Quick!
You miss...
You carry.
The Kangaroo smells
your stinky feet.
Then runs away.
That's why I miss.
Jundah! Make a fire!
Who do I thank for dinner?
Hanif or Woorak?
Who was it?
My rifle... something is wrong.
You are wrong.
It was not my stinky feet...
that scared off the kangaroo.
Before you shoot...
I let out a big fart.
Woorak must return
to his people.
Men's business. Ceremony.
We should join him.
Visit the tribe, for a time.
Coobering has asked
to speak with you.
Jundah, look!
Stay there.
He is Sikh.
We must burn him.
You attack a white man.
Trouble now come
for you and me.
It's over.
I must leave your country.
Come speak with Coobering.
Like Jundah said.
My country is far away.
Over water so big, you see
no land for a long time.
The cost to journey that far
is great.
You must hear
what Coobering has to say.
I cannot speak his words.
Then go,
if that is your decision.
I will meet you there.
Some tools and flour.
Jundah's dried dates.
Keep them.
You're a bad hunter.
Especially with that rifle.
Hey, kid!
Hey, come here!
You're insane.
Bringing a white man here.
What are you thinking?
After a white man
killed Jundah.
We must go deeper
into our country.
It is safer for us there.
Coobering allows
the white man to stay.
But only until we go.
Then he must find his own way.
Told you it was broken.
The women can use itâ€¦
To dig for bush potato.
Hold him down.
Hold him
or his wound will reopen.
Crazy white man.
First time Jundah brought you
to us, you didn't say a word.
Just stared at
the women's breasts.
You have been kind.
Taught me much.
Will the white man live?
His scars... He has been shot
before and lived.
Those scars are from spears,
not white man weapons.
Tomorrow, these boys will go
through ceremony.
Sent into the desert, alone.
With nothing.
If they return, they are worthy
of a wife, as men.
We offered Jundah this chance.
He said...
Yes.
He was to go through ceremony.
Our lore.
As one of us.
Jundah knew where he belonged.
Who his family was.
Do you?
Now I see why
you help this white man.
Already you invite
great danger.
By bringing him here,
to my people.
But this?
He is no threat.
He is alone.
Alone?
They are never alone...
This yellow rock.
They go mad for it.
Break oaths.
They kill.
All for this rock...
We have no other far away place
to run to, like you...
You come and go like the wind,
with no care for the dust storm
you kick up behind you.
You are a boy.
I was a fool.
To think that you would
walk with us one day.
N-no, Adeeb. Please, I will...
No, I'll help. Let me.
I said no... I said no.
You have many camels
to tend to.
This is my mess.
I swear, you two will fight
over anything.
Your mess.
We all know he left Chadwick
so he could chase native women.
Don't let Adeeb get to you.
In the daytime
working with camels,
this land doesn't feel
so different to home.
But at night...
No matter how long I am here,
the stars are all strange.
Backwards...
This is when I feel
far from my wife.
My children.
When you get home, Hanif...
Look at the stars for me?
May God keep watch over you.
