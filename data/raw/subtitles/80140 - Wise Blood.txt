There's too many people
on the streets.
- How long you been here?
- Two days.
I been here two months.
I work at the zoo.
- I didn't catch your name good.
- Hazel Motes.
Hazel Motes. You look I i ke you m i ght
be fol leri n' them hicks.
Stop! Don't you see that -
Now, what do you thi nk that thi ng
is up there for?
Maybe you thought that red was for white fol ks
and green ones was for ni ggers, huh?
- That's what I thought.
- You tel I al I your friends about these I ights.
Red is for stop.
Green is for go.
Men and women, white fol ks and niggers -
al I go on the same light.
Now, you tel I al I your friends
about that now, you hear?
So that when they come to town,
they'I I know.
I 'I I look after hi m.
He ai n't been here but two days.
- I'm obl iged.
- Wasn't nothi n'.
I reckon I 'I I go along
and keep you com pany for a whi le.
Sure wouldn't wanna get messed up
with no hicks...
particularly the J esus kind.
I know. I done a lot of that myself.
I was 12 years old, and I could si ng
some hymns good I learned off this nigger.
So this here welfare woman
traded me from my daddy...
took me off to Boonvi I le
to I ive with her.
She had a brick house,
but it was J esus al I day long.
Reckon she was 40 years old,
and she was ugly.
Her hai r was so thi n, it looked I i ke
ham gravy trickl i n' down her skul I.
I got out though.
Wanna know how?
I scared the hel I out of that woman.
That's how.
I studied and I studied on it.
I even prayed.
I said, "J esus, show me a way
to get outta here. "
Durned if he didn't.
I got up one morni n' just before dayl ight.
I went i nto her room
without my pants on...
and pul led up the sheet
and give her a heart attack.
Yourjawjust crawls, don't it?
Don'tlyou never laugh?
I t's that boy, Papa.
I can smel I the si n on his breath.
- What'd you fol ler me for?
- I never fol lered you.
- She said you was fol leri n' me.
- I ai n't fol lered you nowheres.
I fol lered her.
I don't want that thi ng.
T ake it. I don't want it.
You take it and you shut up
before I hit you.
I won't have it.
You take it I i ke I told you!
He never fol lered you.
I got it, but it ai n't m i ne.
I fol lered her to say I wasn't beholdi n'
to none of her fast eye...
I i ke she give me back there.
What do you mean?
I never looked at you with no fast eye.
I onlly watchedlyou tearin' up
that tract.
Papa, he tore it up i n I ittle pieces.
- He tore it up and spri nkled it al I over the ground I i ke salt!
- Shut up!
He fol lered me.
Nobody could fol ler you.
I can hear the urge ofJ esus
i n his voice.
J esus.
Nowlyou listen to me, boly.
Jesus is a fact!
- You can't run away from J esus.
- No. You I isten.
I come a long way
si nce I bel ieve i n anythi ng.
I come halfway around the world.
You ai n't come so far that you could keep
from fol leri n' me, though, have you, boy?
Some preacher's left his mark on you.
Did you fol low me for me to take it off
or to give you another one?
I hear 'em
scrapi n' thei r feet i nside.
Get out the tracts.
They're fixi n' to come out.
- What we gonna do? What's i nside that there bui Idi ng?
- Program lettin' out.
Here, take this, boy, and go up
to the other side and give out.
I 'I I stay here with the one
that fol lered me.
Now you go to the top of them stai rs
and repent, boy, and renounce your si ns...
and distri bute these tracts
to the people.
I'm as clean as you are.
Fornication, blasphemy.
What else?
I f I was i n si n, I was i n it
before I ever com m itted any.
There ai n't no change come i n me.
I don't bel ieve i n si n!
Nothi n' matters
but that J esus don't exist!
Go distri bute them tracts
to the people.
I 'I I take 'em up there
and throw 'em i n the bushes.
You be watchi n'.
See can you see.
J esus cal Is you.
J esus cal Is you.
Hey! Lookee down yonder.
Do you see that bl i nd man
down there?
He's givi n' out tracts and beggi ng.
J esus! You ought to see hi m.
And he's got this here ugly chi Id.
Now you better get
on the other side, lady.
There's a fool down there
givi n' out tracts.
Don't pay no attention
to that fanatic up there.
Don't I know what exists
and what don't?
Ai n't I got eyes i n my head?
Am I a bl i nd man?
Let me tel I you somethi n'.
Maybe you thi nk that you ai n't clean
because you don't bel ieve.
Every one oflyou are clean,
and I'll telllyou whly.
I f you thi nk it's because
ofJ esus Christ crucified, you' re wrong.
I ai n't sayi ng he wasn't crucified,
but I say it wasn't for you.
I'm gonna start a new church -
the Church ofTruth
Withoutjesus Christ Crucified.
And it won't cost you nothi n'
to joi n my church.
- Blind preacher here, folks.
- I t a i n't started yet, but i t's gonna be.
I don't need J esus.
What do I need J esus for?
I got Leora Watts.
Hawks. Asa Hawks's the name
when you go to fol leri n' me agai n.
Si n is a trick on niggers.
Si n ai n't on my books.
Hey.
Now we got shut of them, why don't we
go someplace and have us some fun?
Heard about there's this house we can go
and have us some fun.
I could pay you back next week.
I got busi ness of my own.
I seen just about al I ofyou I want.
I been here two months,
and I don't know nobody.
People ai n't friendly here.
I thi nk I seen you
someplace before.
- You ai n't from Stockwel I, are you?
- No.
Looked I i ke you had
a ki nd of fam i I iar face.
Good-bye.
I'm goi n' thisaway too.
My daddy made me come.
I ai n't but 18 years old,
and he made me come here.
And I don't know nobody, and nobody
here wi I I have nothi n' to do with me.
They ai n't friendly.
Look a-here. You want a woman, you don't
have to go fol leri n' nothi n' ugly...
I i ke that kid you give a peeler to.
Look, get away from me.
People here ai n't friendly.
You ai n't from here,
but you ai n't friendly neither.
And you don't know nobody neither.
I knew when I fi rst seen you that you
didn't have nobody or nothi n' but J esus.
I seen you. Yeah, I knew it.
That's ri ght.
Standi n' around acti n' I i ke you got
wiser blood than anybody else.
But you ai n't, 'cause I'm the one that has it.
Not you. Me.
What are you tal ki n' about?
About I know thi ngs
I ai n't never learned -
how I can see signs.
I t's somethi n' that just happens,
and I got to do some thi ngs someti mes.
I got to do some things
sometimes I don't even wanna do.
And sometimes inside me,
I can feel it.
I can feel it pullin' and tuggin' at me
and pushin'...
and I can feel my blood beatin',
and I got to do this thing right now.
It's - It's wise blood.
It ain't everybody has it.
See, it's a gift.
I t's a gift like, uh,
the gift of the prophets.
Now, I ain't sayin' I'm a prophet.
No, it ain't like that, but it's like that.
You're crazy, boy.
You get away from me,
and you stay away.
I'm goi n' where I'm goi n'.
I got a woman.
I got a woman, see?
And that's where I'm goi n' -
to visit her.
She told me where thely live.
That girllyou give a peeler to -
she said to visit 'em and to bringlyou there.

...repent to the Lord and burn lyour elyes clean.
You'll see lyourselves
for what lyou was - filth.
A generation ofblasphemers
and whoremongers, every one oflyou.
There ain't one oflyou is a clean man
or woman or child.
I tell lyou there ain't no finer act
than God's judgment.
Repent before he cas ts lyou down
into the burning pit ofhell...
like s tones into a lake of fire.
You don't j ust wa I k i n here I i ke that.
I ' I I s how you

- Let m e see Sl ade.
- What you wa nt to see h i m for?
I wa nt to see hi m about thi s here car.

How m uch do you fi gure?
Give us an esti mate.
- What do you want?
- I want this here car.
- I m i ght take $300 for it.
- I wouldn't pay no more than 200 for it.
That car, you can't buy I i ke that every day.
I t's got new ti res on it.
They was new when it was bui It.
They bui It good cars several years ago.
They don't bui Id good cars no more.
- You wanna get underneath it and look at it?
- No.
T old you you wouldn't bust them ti res.
What'I I you give me for it?
I'll take two and a half.
That wouldn't be worth
what it'd cost to cart it off.
I won't argue with you about that.
This car wasn't bui It
by a bunch of niggers.
I fyou don't want this one, there's plenty more
you can look at just the same price.
What do you want for it?
I'll take two and a quarter,
and you can pay me when you leave.
- Two and a quarter and some gas.
- T ank's ful I.
I wanted this car mostly
to be a house for me.
I ai n't got no place to be.
You got to switch it on
with them two wi res right there.
You gotta let the hand brake down.
He would die 10 million times...
have his arms and his legs
stretched out on the cross and nailed-
10 million times forjus t one soul.
Even for that boy there,
he wou I d d i e 10 m i I I i on ti m es.
He will chase him
over the waters ofsin.
Iflyou doubt thatjesus
walks over the waters ofsin -
This boly has been chas tened,
and he will be redeemed.
Jesus will never leave him ever.
Jesus will have lyou in the end.
What a re you doi n' pa rked
i n the m i dd I e of the road, son?
T a ke you r ha nd off my s hou I der.
I ' m read i n' that s i g n.
There ain't a person or whoremonger

Look. I'm looki n' for that bl i nd preacher

" Muv-se-vum. "
Wal k easy. I don't wanna

He ai n't very friendly with me.
You see that there notice?
I t says he was once as tal I

Some A-rabs done it to hi m

Took all the blood out ofhim.
Then thely done it to him.

I swear to you.
Wait. I think that's it.
I'm trying to help lyou find it, Hazel, but -
I can't use none of your hel p!
You I ied to m e.
You ai n't got any better i dea

- N o, i t ai n't true. She told me -
- You I ied to me!
You been runni n' up and down this city...
just to show me some ki nd
of dried-up dead man...
and a cage of monkeys
and a - and a hoot owl.
And now you can't fi nd 'em because
you don't know where they I ive.
U h, if a room's free,
I'd I i ke to rent it.
Room's for rent, al I ri ght.
What do you do?
I'm a preacher.
- What church?
- Church ofT ruth Without Christ.
Protestant... or-or somethi n' foreign?
Oh, no, ma'am. I t's Protestant.
You can look at the room.
I t's $20 a week, i n advance.
Man named Hawks I ives here,

Downstai rs i n the front room -

I t used to be a fi re escape there,
but I don't know what happened to it.
Wel I, I 'I I take the room.

that one that keeps fol leri n' me.
Get away.
What do you want?
I I ive here now.
I thought ifyour gi rl

What I give you the other day

for what I seen you do.
It was lyou give me the elye.
You should've seen hi m, Papa.
He looked me up and down.
I started mly own church.
I'm gonna be preachi n' it
on the streets.
You can't leave me alone,
can you, boy?
I didn't ask you to come here,
and I ai n't aski n' you to hang around.
What the hel I ki nd of-of a preacher are you
not to see ifyou can save my soul?
Goddam n J esus hog.
Wel I, look what you used to be.
Look whatlyou tried to do.
You got over it.
So wi I I he.
I don't want hi m around here.
He makes me nervous.
Listen here. You hel p me to get hi m.
Then you go away and do what you please,
and I can I ive with hi m.
He don't even know you exist.
Even if he don't, that's al I right.
That's how come
I can get hi m easy.
I want hi m, and you oughta hel p.
Then you can go off I i ke you want to.
Al I right, but you better make it work
ifyou want to eat after I'm gone.
I 'I I get hi m.
That m ight be just fi ne.
Might be the oi I on Aaron's beard.
Listen here. I t would be the nuts.
I'm just crazy about him.
I never seen a boy
I liked the looks of any better.
Don't run him off.
T el I hi m how you bl i nded yourself for J esus
and show hi m that cl i ppi ng you got.
The cl i ppi ng.
Mly church is the Church Without Christ.
I am a m em ber
and a preacher to that church...
where the bl i nd don't see
and the lame don't wal k...
and what's dead stays that way.
What church you belong to?
You, boy. There.
- I said, what church lyou belong to?
- Church of Christ.
Wel I, ask me about my church,
and I 'I I tel I you...
it's the church that the blood ofJ esus
don't foul with redem ption.
Listen here. I'm gonna take the truth
with me wherever I go.
I'm gonna preach it
to whoever will listen.
I'm gonna preach
that there was no Fall...
'ca use there was noth i n'
to fa I I from.
N o redem pti on
'ca use there was no Fal I...
and no judgment
because there wasn't the first two.
N othi n'm atters
but that J esus Christ was a I iar!
- Hazel? Listen here, Hazel. I found it.
- What do you want?
I found it - the house where they I ive.
You shouldn't have oughta hit me, Hazel.
It weren't nothin'I done

I only thought it was a three. But I found it,
and I 'I I take you there ifyou want.
I know where they I ive.
- I I ive there now, see?
- You know where they I ive?
But ifyou didn't know and I told you,
then you'd know now.
Oh, get outta here.
All he can do is hang around
and make a fool out ofhimself.
He don't know whether
he's comin ' or goin '.
He-He ain't nothin '
but a shiftless, crazly boly.
Ifjesus Chris t had redeemedlyou,
what difference would it make to lyou?
What d i fference wou I d i t m a ke
to that crazy boy?
There's no peace for the redeem ed.
If there was three crosses there...
a nd J es us Chri st
hung on the m i ddl e one...
that wouldn't mean no more
to you or me than the other two.
What you need is somethi n'
to take the place ofJ esus...
somethin' that would speak plain.
Now, the Church Without Christ
don't have a J esus.
But it needs one.
It needs a newjesus -
one that's al I man,
without blood to waste...
that don't look like anly other man,
so lyou'll look at him.
- Give m e such a J esus.
- I got him!
I m ean, I can get hi m.
H i m - you seen hi m yourself.
Him that I showed to lyou -
the newjesus.
I ' I I get hi m.
I ' I I get hi m for you, H azel.
You look at me
andlyou look at a peaceful man -
peaceful because
mly blood has set me free.
- Who i s i t?
- It's me.
Com e i n.
What do you wa nt?

how com e you don't get h i m
to cure you?
H e bl i nded Paul.
Where did you get them scars
under your eyes?
Get me that cl i ppi ng.
Here. Read that.
That's how I got the scars.
He done it with lime.
And there was hundreds converted.
Anybody that bl i nded hi ssel f
for justi fi cati on oughta be abl e to save you...
or even som ebody of hi s bl ood.
N obody wi th a good car...
needs to be justified.
The bastard got away with my cl i ppi ng.
Go get it.
Wel I, you got another cl i ppi ng,
ai n't ya?
The one that says,
" Evangel ist's Nerve Fai Is. "
Thief!. Thief!.
I been here al I the ti me,
and you never known it.
What do you want to hide
i n my car for?
I got busi ness before me.
I ai n't got ti me for any fool ishness.
Let's drive a bit.
My name is Sabbath -
Sabbath Li ly Hawks.
My mother named me that
just after I was born...
because I was born on the Sabbath.
And then she turned over i n her bed
and died, and I never seen her.
- U h-huh.
- H i m and her wasn't married.
And that makes me a bastard,
but I can't hel p it.
I t was what he done to me
and not what I done to myself.
- Bastard?
- A real bastard.
Do you know what?
"A bastard shal I not enter
the ki ngdom of heaven. "
- How could you be a bastard when -
- Do you read the papers?
No.
Wel I, there's this woman i n it
named Mary Brittle...
that tel Is you what to do
when you don't know.
- You couldn't - - I wrote her a
letter and asked what I was to do.
- You couldn't be a bastard when -
- I said, " Dear Mary, I am a bastard...
"and a bastard shal I not enter
the ki ngdom of heaven, as we al I know.
" But I have this personal ity
that makes boys fol low me.
" Do you thi nk I should neck or not?
"I shal I not enter
the ki ngdom of heaven anyway...
so I don't see what difference it makes. "
- Listen here. I fyour daddy was -
- Then she answered my letter i n the paper.
She said, " Dear Sabbath,
I ight necki ng is acceptable...
"but I thi nk your real problem
is one of adjustment to the modern world.
" Perhaps you ought to reexam i ne
your rel igious val ues...
"to see if they meet
your needs i n I ife.
"A rel igious experience can be
a beautiful addition to I ivi ng...
"ifyou put it i n the proper perspective
and do not let it warp you.
Read some books on ethical culture. "
You couldn't be a bastard when -
You m ust be m ixed up.
Your daddy bl i nded hisself
for J esus Christ -
Then I wrote another letter.
I says, " Dear Mary,
what I real ly want to know...
"is should I go
the whole hog or not.
That's my real problem.
I've adjusted okay to the modern world. "
- But your daddy bl i nded hisself for J es -
- He wasn't always as holy as he is now.
She never answered my second letter.
You mean i n his youth, your daddy
didn't bel ieve, but he come to.
- I s that what you mean, or ai n't it?
- That's right.
You quit feel i n' that -
my leg with yours.
Can you turn down that di rt road?
Ho-How did he come to bel ieve?
What changed hi m
to a preacher ofJ esus?
Why don't we get out and sit under the trees
where we can get better acquai nted?
Was he always such an evi I-seem i n' man
before he came to bel ieve...
or just part-way evi I seem i n'?
Al I-the-way evi I.
Stop the car.
Let's get out here.
Let's sit down for a whi le.
I gotta be goi n' back to town.
I ai n't got ti me to set i n any woods.
I suppose, before he came to bel ieve,
he didn't bel ieve at al I.
I can save you.
I've got a church i n my heart
where J esus is ki ng.
I bel ieve i n the new ki nd ofJ esus -
the one that can't waste his blood
redeem i ng people with it...
'cause he's al I man
and ai n't got any God i n hi m.
Mly church is the Church Without Christ.
Wel I, can a bastard be saved i n it?
They ai n't any such a thi ng as a bastard
i n the Church Without Christ.
Everything is all one.
Bastard wouldn't be any different
from anybody else.
That's good.
There was this child once
that nobodly cared if it lived or died.
I ts ki n sent i t around
from one to another of them...
and fi nal ly to i ts grandm other,
who was a very evi I wom an.
And she couldn't stand
to have it around...
'cause the least good thing
made her break out in these welts.
She'd get al I i tchi n' and swol e.
Even her eyes woul d i tch her
and swel I up.
And there wasn't nothi ng she could do
but run up and down the road...
shaki n' her hands and cursi n'.
And it was twice as bad
when this child was there...
so she kept the child locked up
in a chicken crate.
I t seen i ts granny i n hel I fi re...
swol e and burni n'...
and i t tol d her everythi ng i t seen.
And she got so swol e
unti I fi nal ly she went to the wel I...
and wrapped the wel I rope
around her neck...
and let down the bucket
and broke her neck.
Would you guess me to be
17 years old?
Wouldn't be any sense to the word
"bastard" i n the Church Without Christ.
Ai n't my feet white though?
Why don't you I ie down and rest yourself?
Don't make any difference to me
how m uch you I i ke me.
I see you.
I see you.
Get away from me!
Come on, ifyou don't want to get left.
What'd you do to my car?
What's wrong i n there?
I t's a good car, ai n't it?
Look, m ister.
That's a good car.
That car'll get me
anywhere I want to go.
I told you this car'I I get me
anywhere I want to go.
She may stop every once i n a whi le,
but she won't stop permanent.
- How m uch do I owe you?
- Not a thi ng.
- What about the gas?
- Nothin'.
- Not a thi ng.
- Al I ri ght. Thank you.
T old you this car'I I get me
anywhere I want to go.
I t's a grand auto.
Goes as smooth as honey.
Wasn't bui It by a bunch of foreigners
or niggers, nor one-armed men.
I t was bui It by people
with thei r eyes open...
who knew where they was at.
Some folks
is-is-is alwalys disputin ' everything.
Some folks thinks that thely -
that thely owe...
everyth i ng that they got
to J es us Ch ri st cruci fi ed.
Wel I, i n my economy, there a i n't
nobody that owes nothi n' to nobody.
Are you gonna stay and I isten,
or you -
are you gonna wal k away
I i ke everybody else?
Well, go on and go.
But remem ber, the truth
don't I urk around every street corner.
Fol ks. Fol ks Come on. Come on.
Come on, you fol ks.
Stay now. Come back here.
Come on. Come on back here.
Yes, ma'am. just come on.
Come on now. Staly.
I was just fixin ' to telllyou all about me.
I wi sht I had my gui tar.
Somehow it's just easier for me...
to say somethi ng sweet with m usic,
rather than just - just plai n.
Listen to me, friends.
Before I met this prophet here...
I didn't have a friend in this world.
Do any ofyou know what it means...
not to have a friend i n the world?
Ain't no worse than nobodly who wouldn't stick
a knife in lyour back when lyou wasn't lookin '.
You sai d a m outhful
when you sai d that, fri end.
Everybody, fri ends,
I want to i ntrod uce mysel f to you.
My nam e i s Onni e J ay H oly...
and I am a preacher.
I don't - I don't m i nd you knowi ng that.
But I don't -
I don't want you to bel ieve anythi ng.
And I wouldn't ask you
to bel ieve anythi ng...
that you did not feel
right i n your own hearts.
Friends, everybodly that's born
onto this earth...
is full ofsweetness and love.
You know that
when a chi I d gets bi gger...
that sweetness just doesn't
show so good, does i t?
I m ean, troubles come
to perplext hi m, fol ks.
I mean, the sweetness gets driven i nside.
Then he becomes miserable
and lonesome and- and sick...
and, lyou know, he starts to saly...
"Now, where's mly sweetness gone?"
I f som ebody's sweetness, fri ends,
they m i g ht j ust des pa i r com pl etely.
H uh? I m ean, despai r.
N ow that - that's the way i t was
with me, friends.
I know what of I speak here.
Before I met the prophet.
Before I found out
he was out here to hel p me.
I mean, he's out here preachi ng
the Church of Christ Without Christ.
Now I want you al I to I isten to hi m.
I want you to I isten to hi m and to me,
and I want you to joi n our church.
The holy Church...
ofJ esus Christ Without Christ.
That - That man ain't true.
- I never seen him before tonight.
- I wasn't true, friends.
I wasn't true before I met this prophet here.
I want you to know that. I wasn't true.
I didn't preach the truth. But I'm
gonna give you some reasons right now...
why you can joi n this church,
why it's best for you.
The fi rst thi ng is
there's just nothi ng foreign about it.
- No. Nothi ng foreign about it.
- No. No, I isten.
Blasphemy ain't the way to the truth,
whether you understand it or not.
- Hear the prophet! Hear the prophet!
- This - This man is a liar.
- I never seen him before tonight.
- I I ied before I met this prophet.
I'm gonna give you some more reasons
why you ought to joi n this church, friends.
Some more reasons are
is this church is right up to date.
Now you hear me. I t's up to date.
You belong to this church, nothin' or nobody
is ever gonna be ahead ofyou, right?
Nothin' or nobody will be ahead ofyou.
Nobody's gonna know somethi ng
that you don't know.
No, si r! I mean, al I the cards right out
on the table, friends. That's a fact.
That's a natural fact. Now, it's gonna cost
each and every one ofyou here a dol lar.
- What's a dollar? A dollar's a few dimes.
- Here's my dol lar.
- That's not too much to unlock the little rose ofsweetness inside lyou.
- Li sten.
- J ust one dol I ar.
- I t don't cost you any m oney -
- H ear the prophet!
- to know the truth.
You can't know it from money.
You see?
A dol lar's not too m uch, friends.
You see? The prophet
don't care nothi n' about money.
I t's not too m uch to know the truth,
just one dol lar.
U h - U h, fol ks,
I'm gonna have to leave you now.
But we're gonna meet here agai n
tomorrow night i n this very same spot.
- Right i n this same place. I gotta
catch up with the prophet right now.
Where you goin'?
There must be at least $ 10 out there.
What's the big hurry, friend?
Now I isten. You and me
have got to get together on this thi ng.
- You know what you put me i n m i nd of
when I fi rst seen you?
J esus Christ and Abraham Li ncol n.
You're -
- Get out.
- What are you sayi n', friend?
Hey. I've been on the radio
for three years.
I'm a real preacher, friend.
You better I isten to me now.
- Get out!
- Listen. You want to get anywhere i n the rel i gion busi ness...
you've got to keep it sweet.
Listen, friend!
Listen. You got some good ideas.
You got good ideas.
Al I they need is a I ittle promotion.
That J esus idea is a good one.
- Al I we gotta do is promote it.
- Look. Look.
There ai n't any such a thi ng
as any new J esus.
That wasn't nothi n'
but a way of sayi n' somethi ng, Holy!
My name ai n't Holy.
My name is Hoover Shoates.
And you better remem ber it, friend,
because I'm about to run you out of busi ness.
I mean, I'm gonna be back here
tomorrow night with a new prophet.
I can fi nd prophets for peanuts, friend.
I 'I I do my own preachi n',
you understand me?
You better watch it, 'cause what you need
is a I ittle com petition. You understand?
Now, then, you can get out.
Now you can leave me alone.
Hi, Hazel.
I don't care iflyou hit me.
I ' m stayi ng with you.
I ' m not goi n'.
He ai n't bl i nd.
Your daddy ai n't bl i nd.
I thought anybody

He's just a crook.

Without his glasses. And -
And he saw me too.
Listen.
The m i nute I set eyes on you...
I said to myself...
that's what I gotta have.
J ust give me some of hi m.
I said, " Look at those pecan eyes
and go crazy, gi rl.
"That innocent look don't hide a thing.
" He's just pure filthy...
"ri ght to the guts, I i ke me.
"The only difference is...
" I I i ke bei ng that way...
and he don't. "
Yes, si r.
I I i ke bei ng that way,
and I can teach you how to I i ke it.
Don't you want to learn
how to I i ke it?
Yeah. Yeah, I want to.
T ake offyour hat,

Something he gotta have.
Something that'll save

And he'll do something with it,
'cause it don't look like no other J esus.
You just give it to him.
Well, I declare.
You're right cute, ain't ya?
Who's your mama and daddy?
Oh!

And where you are...

Your conscience... is a trick.

And ifyou thi nk it does...

Knocked mly car in a ditch!

He bought me this suit...
and I thrown my other one away.
T ake it off!.
T ake it al I off!.
Two thi ngs that I just can't stand -
a man that ai n't true
and one that mocks what is.
You should never have tem pered with me
ifyou didn't want what you got.
I gave my mother...
a lot of trouble.
Never gave her no rest.
And I stole that there car.
And I never told the truth to my daddy.
I told them where his sti I I was...

Where are you goi n'?
I'm goin' to another city

Hazel!
Hazel Motes!
Hazel.
Okay. I want you to fil I the car with gas...
I want you to check the oi I

I ' m goi n' on a tri p.
- Where you goi n'?

Look.
Nobody with a good car needs to worry
about nothi n'. You understand?
Yep.
You got two leaks i n the radiator.
This here ti re wi I I last
maybe 20 m i les ifyou go slow.
This car is just begi nni ng its I ife.
A I ightning bolt couldn't stop it.
Ain't no use putting water in.
I t won't hold it.
Well, put it in there just the same.
I wasn't speedin', was I?
No. You wasn't speedin'.
Well, I was drivin'
on the right side of the road.
Yes. You was on the right side
of the road.
That's right.
What'd you stop me for then?
I just don't like your face.
Well, I don't like yours either.
- Where is your license?
- I don't need a license.
No. I don't reckon you do need one.
Well, I ain't got one if I do.
Look. Would you mind following me
down the road just a little ways.
There's a view
I want to show you there.
Prettiest viewlyou ever did see.
Fol low me.
I thi nk you'd better get out.
You'I I see the view better
ifyou were outside.
What you gonna do with that,
Mr. Motes?
He's done it!
H e's bl i nded hi ssel f!.
He blinded himself!.
H e bl i nded hi m sel f!.
H e gone and done i t. H e bl i nded hi m sel f!.
Just t-take it easly.
That gi rl is gone, Mr. Motes,
I ' m happy to say.
She left ri ght after
you did what you did.
Said she hadn't counted on
no honest-to-J esus bl i nd man...
and she run off
to catch up with her daddy.
Real trash, Mr. Motes.
I run a orderly house,
and that gi rl was trash if I ever saw it.
Now...
here we are.
Everythi ng is just the same
as before.
T omorrow I 'I I bri ng your chai r back up.
I'm obl iged.
Not at al I, Mr. Motes.
I want you to be comfortable i n my house.
Oh, here. Let me hel p you
get out of these clothes.
Oh, no, no.
I can - I can take off my own clothes.
U h, I don't need no more hel p.
Wel I, al I ri ght.
You just cal I me ifyou need me.
Welcome back, Mr. Motes.
Why don't you start preachi ng agai n,
Mr. Motes?
Bei ng bl i nd wouldn't be a hi ndrance.
People I i ke to see a bl i nd preacher.
Could get you one of them seei ng dogs.
You and hi m could get up quite a crowd.
People always pay to see a dog.
Certainlly ought to start it again.
Give lyou something to do.
You haven't done a thi ng
for months but wal k.
Why don't you start preachi ng agai n?
I can't preach.
Whly?
I ai n't got ti me.
Mr. Motes.
That wire.
What's that wire aroundlyou for?
What you do these th i n gs for?
- T o pay.
- Paly? Paly for what?
M r. Motes, what do you
wa I k on rocks for?
I t don't m a ke a ny d i fference what for.
- I-It's not natural.
- I t's - I t's natural.
Wel I, i t's not norm al.
I -I t's I i ke one of them gory stories...
that some people have quit doin '.
Like boiling in oil
or being a saint or walling up cats.
Th-There's no reason to i t.
Peopl e have qui t doi n' it.
They - They ai n't qui t doi n' it...
as I ong as I ' m doi n' it.
People have quit doi n' it.
What do you do it for?
I ai n't cl-clean.
I know it.
You got blood on that shi rt...
and in the bed.
That ain't the kind of clean.
There's only one kind of clean,
Mr. Motes.
You can't see.
I wouldn't be surprised
ifyou wasn't some kind of a...
agent ofthe pope or...
g- got some connection
with somethin' funnly.
The way you I ive,
Mr. Motes, is terri ble.
You-You m i ght as wel I be
one of them monks.
You m i ght as wel I I ive i n a -
i n a monkery.
It's not good forlyou, Mr. Motes.
I ai n't argui ng with you about this.
Hear that wi nd, Mr. Motes?
I t's fortunate for you to have this...
warm place to be and...
somebody to take care ofyou.
Every bl i nd and sick man
isn't so fortunate as to...
have somebody that cares for hi m.
Let me tel I you, Mr. Motes...
few men are as fortunate as you.
But I - I can't keep cl i m bi n'
up and down those stai rs.
It wears me out.
I've been thinkin ' ofwhat
we could do about it.
I know you I i ke it here,
and you don't want to leave this house...
and you' re a sick man and need somebody
to take care of you, beside bei ng bl i nd.
So I been thi nki n'
