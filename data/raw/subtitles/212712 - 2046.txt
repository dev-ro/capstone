In the year 2046
every railway network spreads the globe
A mysterious train leaves for 2046
every once in a while
Every passenger who goes to 2046
has the same intention
They want to recapture lost memories
Because nothing ever changes in 2046
Nobody really knows if that's true
Because nobody's ever come back
Except me
If someone wants to leave 2046...
how long will it take?
Some people get away very easily
Others find that
it takes them much longer
I forget how long
I've been on this train
I start to feel very lonely
As I recall many have gone to 2046
You're the first to come back
May I ask why you left 2046?
Whenever one asked why I left 2046...
I gave them some vague answers
Before...
when people had secrets
they didn't want to share
...they'd climb a mountain
They'd find a tree and carve hole in it
And whisper the secret into the hole
Then cover it over with mud
That way, nobody else
would ever discover it
I once fell in love with someone
After a while, she wasn't there
I went to 2046
I thought she might be waiting
for me there
But I couldn't find her
I can't stop wondering
if she loved me or not
But I never found out
Maybe her answer was like a secret...
that no one else would ever know
All memories are traces of tears
Didn't you promise not to come back?
I came to see you
Why?
I have no prospects here
So I'll see how things are in Hong Kong
When are you leaving?
The boat sails in two days
Why are you telling me?
I thought we might go together
You know nothing about my past, do you?
If you'd rather not tell me
I don't mind
If you win, I'll join you
She found an indirect way
of rejecting me
As I recall...
...that was the very last time
we saw each other
Right after that, I left Singapore
I got back to Hong Kong
at the end of 1966
There was riots in Kowloon
due to the price rise of ferry ticket
I wasn't sure how long I'd be staying...
So I took a room
in a small hotel in Wanchai
I wrote columns for the Newspapers
They paid HK$10 per thousand words
It was pretty tough at first
As long as I could make ends meet
...it made no difference
what kind of stuff I wrote
'Diary of the Bezooke Hero'
The new star at Club Luk Kwok
is Fai Fai!
A knockout beauty with amazing bezookes!
A smash hit with tit-lovers!
Hang on, of course I exaggerate
I can't say her tits are fake, can I?
I soon got used to this kind of life
I became an expert of ladies
Lots of one-night-stands
Never mind
nothing lasts forever anyway
24-Dec-66
Is that really true?
Why would I lie to you?
You really know me?
Weren't you in a show
in Singapore in 64?
Yes
You're Lu-lu
I was then
Not anymore
What's your name now?
Why should I tell you?
On Christmas Eve 1966...
...I ran into a friend
from Singapore in a nightclub
We'd been rather close
But that night...
...she'd apparently forgotten me
Have we really met before?
How could you forget?
You said I looked like
your last boyfriend
You taught me the Cha-cha
Go on...
You were always dragging me
to the casino
You'd hit a losing streak
You owed a fortune
My friends and I paid for
your passage to Hong Kong
You talked a lot
about your last boyfriend
A Chinese Filipino from a rich family
You planned to marry him
But he died young
You said he was the only love
of your life
At this time of year...
I shouldn't bring back sad memories
But do you remember
that Christmas night...
we went drinking?
We talked a lot
Was she just pretending
she'd forgotten me?
I took her back to her hotel
She was drunk
She'd had too much to drink...
...so I left quickly
On my way out
I noticed very a familiar number
If I hadn't run into her that night
I wouldn't have seen that number
...and I wouldn't have written '2046'
Can I help you?
Is Miss Lu-lu in?
Lu-lu? There's no Miss Lu-lu here
There was a Mimi...
...but she's moved out
But I was here two days ago!
Do you know where she's gone?
No! What do you want with her?
Nothing, really
I have her key. I wanted to return it
You can give it to me
Thanks
You want to rent the room?
I'm just back from abroad
I don't have my own place yet
If the room's vacant I could take a look
This is just a small hotel
But our residents are all decent people
What's your line of work?
I write for newspapers
Great! A fellow artist!
I haven't always done this
I used to be an artist too
Really?
I took singing lessons in Haerbin
By then, I was a tenor
It'll be a pleasure to have you here
When will you move in?
As soon as possible
But...
2046 has to be redecorated
2047 is vacant
Take a look at it
Never mind
I'll come back when it's ready
Why that particular room?
Maybe it's the number
It has some significance for you?
I'm joking
Tell you what...
Take a quick look at 2047
If it's okay, you can move in
Then switch to 2046 when it's ready
How about it?
Can I see the room?
Of course! Please...
Once I moved in, I found out...
just the night before...
Lu-lu was stabbed by a jealous boyfriend
A drummer from the club
She'd really liked him...
...and compared him with a bird
that could never land
For all these years...
She has been looking for
her leg-less bird
Most of her affairs ended badly
But she didn't mind sad endings
No matter what happened...
...at least she was always
the leading lady
Good!
Sure!
Go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
I'll go with you!
Good. I'll go with you!
Sure!
I understand!
You know what I mean?
I know... I understand
I got it!
Can I go?
I can go!
Sure!
I understand!
Got it!
It didn't take long
to finish redecorating 2046
But by then I was used to 2047
Sure!
I started hearing a strange voice
through the wall
I thought someone had moved in
But it was the daughter
of the hotel owner, Mr. Wang
Definitely!
I'm definitely going!
Okay, let's go!
I had no idea what she was saying
The staff told me it was Japanese
It seems she had a Japanese boyfriend
Tell the driver 220 Granville Road
Ge... ran... wei... 220 Granville Road
Turn from Humphrey's Avenue near to
Kimberley Road Can you say again?
Don't turn down Salisbury Road
Slowly, please...
I'll draw you a map
No, that's my pen!
I'll repeat it once more
Turn from Humphrey's Avenue
Near to Kimberley Road
But don't turn down Salisbury Road
Understand? No
I'll draw you a map No
Granville Road
Turn from Humphrey's Avenue
Don't turn down Salisbury Road
Remember, don't turn down Salisbury Road
His company in Japan had sent him
to Hong Kong
When he got here he checked
into this hotel
The world is full of men!
Why do you have to choose a Japanese?
Get rid of him!
I will never meet him!
You want my blessing?
Not while I'm alive!
It had been going on for ages
But due to Mr. Wang's opposition
So they had to break up
Can you tell me what you feel?
Do you like me?
Or not?
I'm scared to hear your answer
But I have to ask anyway
Leave with me
Goodbye
The man finally went back to Japan
That's when Miss Wang
began talking to herself
Hey, ask your boss
to turn it down a bit!
Mr. Chow you'd better ask him yourself
Mr. Chow...
Hasn't he left already?
Why is he back?
I will not see him!
If you won't give him up...
Get out! Go away with him!
I assumed that
Mr. Wang played it so loud...
...because he loved his opera
Actually he didn't want anyone
to overhear the family matters
What are you doing?
Come back for me
when you're a little older!
I said, wait till you grow up!
I like it
Mr. Wang's biggest trouble
...is about his two daughters
The elder one was crazy
about her Japanese man
The younger one
was precarious for her age
She kept coming into my room for drinks
Then she ran off with
another drummer from a club band
After she left
her elder sister got into trouble too
Hey, have a word with your boss for me
I'm a bit late with the rent
Anyway, he has my deposit
Mr. Chow, tell him yourself
He's in a foul mood these days
What's eating him?
First, one daughter ran away
Now the other one's in hospital
That's why he's so angry
Why is she in hospital?
He wouldn't say he was quite strange...
Stay clear of him!
So, that's it?
Anyhow, give him my invitation
It's my father's birthday banquet
He can deduct his gift
from the rent I owe
Later they imposed a curfew in Hong Kong
Home-made bombs caused panic
The economy stopped then
I stopped going out
Some thought I was a reformed character
Actually, I was writing
a story called '2046'
All about men and women
looking for love...
...risking everything
to get to a place called 2046
What's that?
Let's go to...
2046
I made it as bizarre and erotic
as possible without crossing the line
The readers liked it
Some didn't take
to the science-fiction angle
But all '2046' meant to me was...
...the number of a hotel room
I made up the whole thing
But some of my own experiences
found their way into it
People I ran into
in the normal course of things...
...turned up in my stories
I felt more and more at ease
in my fiction world
Around that time
Mr. Wang's music got louder again
More trouble with his two daughters...
But also because of the bad state
of the economy
A lot of the rooms were empty
Then in September, the rioting ended
Life went back to normal
Soon, someone moved into 2046
Have you nearly finished?
It's too early in the day for that!
Some of us are trying to sleep!
Peeking?
The woman next door is quite a dish!
What are my chances?
You're off your head!
A father-to-be shouldn't have that
on his mind!
Now she's pregnant
My wife won't let me touch her!
Come on
Put in a word for me
Okay...
How much?
How much have you got?
Only $100...
Wait for my call
Mr. Chow!
Mr. Chow, a call for you!
Would it be too early, huh?
She's not up yet
Why come over?
I told you, it has to be arranged
She's not some street walker!
A fellow artist like you
Show her a little respect, will you?
Yes, I'll tell you right away!
Miss Bai, your key
You're back, Miss Bai
Who is it?
Who are you looking for?
Mr. Chow suggested I come by...
You're back, Mr. Chow
Did you win on the dogs?
I lost! I won a little
Looking for me?
I think you know this person?
What are you doing in that room?
You said you'd arrange it! I paid you!
When did I say it was this room?
I want this one
I said that room
I said this one
Your girl's in that room
I said this one
How embarrassing! Please excuse him
I told you, the room on the left!
I said I wanted that one!
Shut up!
Who is it?
Oh, you again!
I just wanted to apologize
for last night
Forget it. Go away
My editor was out of line
But he's not really so bad
Just a bit stingy! Never pays his way!
Always says he's broke
when the check arrives
So I thought I'd play a trick on him
At my expense? Didn't you go a bit far?
He only fall for it
because you're so beautiful
You're quite a flirt!
Just stating the fact!
A small token of apology
please accept it
I don't want it
You're still mad, aren't you?
Please accept it No!
Come on... No!
It's just a token...
Don't make fun of me. I mean what I say!
Now, get out!
That's good, let it all out
How can I make you feel better?
Slap me again!
Think I wouldn't dare?
Come closer!
Bastard!
Don't be so petty!
That's enough
I'm courteous enough not
to slap you again
That doesn't mean
you can take advantage!
This time I'll give you face
If there's ever a next time
I'll be less polite
It won't happen again
My face is still numb
Accept it!
No!
They're just a token of my regard
I chose them myself
See if you like them
If you don't, just throw them away
Good
I'll leave now
Calm down!
It's none of your business
who I dated last night!
Who?
Dabao!
Which Dabao?
The fat one or the skinny one?
From Shanghai or from Shandong?
The trouble is I know
so many men named Dabao
How should I know which one you mean?
Yes, I did
What are you going to do about it?
Fine!
I'll be waiting!
Let me just say...
Get out!
You think I can accept this?
Her or me
You'd better choose!
Now get out!
24-Dec-67
You're back early!
It's Christmas!
Shouldn't you behaving dinner
with your boyfriend?
What boyfriend?
Then let's have supper!
Come on...
You have so many girlfriends!
You need company?
Go out with them!
They all want to be with me
but I can't choose
The fairest thing is to see none of them
Come on, no point in staying
cooped up in your room
I'm not in a good mood tonight
I might get drunk...
...and slap you again
That's okay
I'm used to it!
If slapping me would make you happy
take that as my Christmas present!
Come on...
Come with me
Let's go!
I didn't expect to spend Christmas
like this
What were you expecting?
We'd made plans
He was taking me to Singapore
He says it's warm there at Christmas
So I didn't even pack winter clothes
What I'm wearing now...
...is for summer!
Have you been to Singapore?
I worked there for several years
What kind of work?
One newspaper
Is it fun there?
It's okay
Tell me more
I won't be going...
so I'll just have to imagine it
What do you want to know?
How's the climate?
Pretty warm
All year round
Sometimes you can't tell
what season it is
The food stalls are great!
Ping and I ate there after work
We'd eat and drink till dawn
Our landlord was a funny man
Short and fat and he always wore a skirt
what the Malays call 'sarong'
But when you're away from home
...it sometimes gets bored
That was a dull meal!
Another drink somewhere else?
You really like to drink?
It makes things easy
When I'm drunk, I have no worries!
Won't your girlfriends
be missing you tonight?
They're not stuck to me!
They see other men too
We just have fun together
They still need to make a living!
I don't get it
Where does all that 'fun' get you?
If you find the right person...
...why waste time on the others?
If I find the right person!
A man like me has nothing much
...except free time
That's why I need company
So people are just time-fillers to you?
I wouldn't say that
Other people can borrow my time too
And this evening?
Are you borrowing me
or am I borrowing you?
No difference!
Maybe I borrowed you earlier...
...and then you're borrowing me
Ridiculous!
Don't get me wrong
I don't intend to take advantage of you
If that was what I wanted...
...I had plenty of options
I just want us to be drinking pals
Is that okay?
It's hard
But I'll give it a try
Okay...
Let's try!
Where to? Let's drink!
Mr. Chow, you seem happy tonight!
I certainly am
my friends are buying me dinner
This way please...
Ping! Is it someone's birthday?
Better than that
Chow has a new girl friend!
Definitely worth celebrating!
Mr. Chow
what would you like to eat tonight?
Something expensive!
Snake?
Yes, snake would be good
Snake isn't cheap
Sure you'll win the bet?
Shut up! Don't mind him
What'll it be Mr. Chow? Snake!
And a lamb casserole too
And bring Hoi's whiskey
Yes! Good!
Can't let this go to waste
it's delicious
Where's your girl, Chow?
It's already 2 a.m. Is she coming?
She isn't coming
She can't be coming
I don't think she's coming
It's all your fault
It's because of you that this happened
Why blame me?
You brought this on yourself
You said she was gentle and obedient
Now we know the truth!
I said she was sometimes obedient...
...and sometimes gentle
But she's full of surprises. That's fun
So, what next? Yes, what now?
What's more I can do?
Whatever you feel like doing
And then what happened?
Tell me!
How are you going to thank me?
Pervert!
Open up!
Who is it?
Open the door!
It's late
You played a fine joke on me tonight
I finished work late
Too late to get there
So I didn't come
What's this?
That's your fault too
How could I know you'd stand me up?
I thought I'd wine few hundred
Instead I lost my moustache
This is all your fault
You deserved it
Who pushed you into the bet?
I'll tell you something...
Ping asked me not to show up
Anyhow...
I wasn't that fond of the moustache
You look younger now
Don't you like it?
You're making fun of me!
You tricked me!
I'll get you for this
How will you make it up to me?
At least give me a kiss
You bit me!
Come and get me!
You're in for it when I catch you!
Don't touch me there!
You fool
are you going to peel my skin off?
You think you are being merciful?
I am bleeding
I wonder if the weather matters
Just a lamb casserole and I am like this
Do you think I've gone wild?
What? Don't move!
What are you doing?
Shaving you Don't!
Who knows where that shaver's been
It may bring me bad luck
Let's go for Round Two!
I don't want it
Why are you dressed?
I'm going back to my room...
I'm exhausted
This is all I have
Aside from loose change for the bus
Here's $200
Please take it
I don't want it
I wasn't selling
That's not how I meant it
I want to pay for your torn dress
Please take it
I see...
You're afraid I'll cling to you
is that it?
Fine...
I'll take $10
Think of it as a discount rate
If you ever want to come over again
...I'll charge the same
I'm going back to my room
Come here
Not tonight
Why not?
Not in the mood?
Can't take the strain tonight
Anyhow, I'm a bit short of cash
Never mind, you can owe me
No...
I don't like being in debt
The reception's at 6, dinner at 8
I don't mind if you can't make it
just send your gift
No more than you do!
You hold banquets all year round!
I've had four birthday invitations
from you this year!
I'll send over
some more invitation cards later
Think of people with money...
Write in their names
and send them invitations!
Okay. That's settled
Mr. Chow, holding another banquet?
You know we have birthdays
in different calendars?
Another of mine has come around
No doubt
Here's one for your boss Alright
Tell him that since we're so close...
He can deduct his gift
from the rent I owe
Make sure he gets it Okay
It's late, what's so urgent?
Just got back from Macau
Chow asked me to bring you a present
You two went to Macau?
Yes, we had some days off
So we went to the casino
Oh, it's beautiful
He says he found some money...
...in his pocket
So before losing it all at the tables...
...he bought you a present
Where is he?
Not back yet. You know what he's like
Extravagant at the start of the month
...and broke wall before the end
He made several thousand hosting
that party
So now he's really enjoying himself!
Is he there alone?
Of course not! There's a gang of them
He likes company
Was he always like this?
Let's not talk about him
Let's have a drink
But I should warn you...
I know you like Chow a lot
Don't waste your time on him
He's not serious!
Guess who?
There's only one possibility!
Let me have a bite first!
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What do you think?
