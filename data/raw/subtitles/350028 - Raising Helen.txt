(d ''Stand Back'' by Joan Osborne)
d I need a Ken doll pilot
with a sexy smile and a flying limousine
d To pick me up, go the extra mile
and deliver me to the scene
d I need five more hours
in the average day
d One to get the work done, four to play
d Be a devil and angel
You know what I mean?
d Stand back
d Out of my way
d Stand back
d You're crowding my day
d No time for good manners, do what I say
d If you're not here to help
then you're just in the way
d The road is littered with the faint of heart,
the fools who fell from stress
d It's a fact of life that you can't catch up,
better learn how to love the mess
d So I'll just kick back, ignore the noise,
have my way with the pretty boys,
d What I dream at night
don't even try to guess
- d Stand back
- d Stand back
d Out of my way
- d Stand back
- d Stand back
d You're crowding my day
d Now this is my time
to step up to the mike
d Like rock'n'roll lightning
I'm ready to strike
- d Stand back
- d Stand back
d Oh
- d Stand back
- d Stand back
d Stand back

But we aII thought...
ope.
It's gonna be hard to take care of us
if you're dead too.
This?
Won't kiII me for years.
Who's gonna take me to schooI?
I guess I am.
- And make me chicken fingers?

And check my nose boogies for infections?
We'II find someone eIse

Come here.
AII we gotta do is stick together.
Everything's gonna be OK.
Thanks for trying, Aunt HeIen,
but it's not gonna be OK.
Come on, Sarah. It's time for your bath.
Come on, Henry.
Good idea. Great. Uh...
You guys do that, whiIe Aunt HeIen
is gonna go out and check the Iawn.
Is Aunt HeIen oIder than you, Audrey?
(Audrey whispers) Get farther down.
Is she pIaying hide-and-go-seek?
(Audrey) I don't think so.
(Henry) We are in deep shit.
(Helen) I Iove ew York pizza.
Aunt HeIen, can we go to
the Statue of Liberty tomorrow?
o, because we won't be here...
- Where's Henry?
- He said he'd be right back.
I go to the bathroom for five seconds,
and he's gone?
- With mustard. Here it is.
- I didn't want mustard.
- You don't want mustard?
- o.
AII right. o mustard.
- There he is.
- Henry!
- OK? Who's gonna pay for this?
- Aunt HeIen.
- You can't do that. You can't just Ieave.
- I hate pizza. I wanted a hot dog.
- Can you pay Aaron, pIease?
- I'm Aaron.
Hi, Aaron. I Iike that he's
making new friends. It's IoveIy.
(Aaron) TaIk me up!
The next time you want something
Iike a hot dog, you teII me, OK?
- And we'II aII go together.
- (Henry) OK.
- Where are we going to dinner?
- This is dinner.
(Sarah) Gee, Mommy never
Iet pizza be our whoIe dinner.
(Henry) And Dad aIways said
not to eat and waIk at the same time.
(Audrey) WeII, they're not here
to yeII at us, so it doesn't matter.
(Henry) How many beds do you have
in your apartment, Aunt HeIen?
- (Sarah) Aunt Helen!
- (Helen laughs)
- Audrey, your knee.
- Stop!
Hey, guys. Shh!
(lisps) I'm teIIing you,
if we don't go to sIeep right now,
SIeepIess SaIIy gets reaIIy upset
when the kids aren't going to sIeep.
Where's Sarah? Sarah?
I'm right down here.
Henry's feet stink. Phew!
- (Henry) But I'm a man.
- (Audrey) Give Aunt HeIen a whiff.
I don't want to smeII your feet.
- Ew! I can smeII them from here.
- Ew!
Ew!
Henry!
You need to wash your feet
not once a week.
(Henry) Good night, aII.
Audrey, get out of the bathroom.
Fire! Fire!
- Aunt HeIen?
- Hm?
Why are we going back? This was great.
We shouId spend more time here.
- More time?
- Yeah.
We can move here.
We can't sIeep every night
in a stinky-feet bed.
We'II move to another apartment.
It's a huge city.
You'II be cIoser to your job and everything.
You Iove your job.
- What about Henry and Sarah?
- What about them?
They've got schooI. They have friends.
You guys grew up in that neighborhood.
That's why. It's a sad neighborhood now.
Everywhere we go there,
we think of Mom and Dad.
- The kids treat me differentIy.
- We wiII discuss this Iater.
PIease think about it, Aunt HeIen.
OK, we got a train to catch. Let's go.
Henry, stop brushing your teeth.
They're gonna faII out.
- I can't get Hippo in the bag.
- Oh, give it to me.
OK.
There. He's in the bag.
Are you happy now?
(Helen) Henry!
ow, the onIy thing to do
wouId be to teII Aunt Jenny.
Thinking about it, Audrey.
I wiII think about it.
- TeII her we voted.
- I'II think about it, Audrey.
I understand the chiIdren's feeIings,
- but that's not part of the pIan.
- That's your pIan, Jenny.
AII right, weII, what about the idea
of not seIIing Lindsay's house?
I know you guys offered to pay
the mortgage, but it's enormous.
I spoke to the bank,
and the mortgage is too much for us.
AII right. Besides being my idea,
what's wrong with moving down the bIock?
I mean, I think
the caIm of the famiIiar is better
than the overwheIming
hustIe-bustIe of the city.
Guys, can you pIease keep the coIoring
on the eggs and not each other?
Oh, no, no, no. o.
Jenny, Sarah thinks that Hippo's parents
are on vacation. That they're coming back.
Henry waIks around Iike a zombie
and draws skeIetons.
- Audrey is my onIy aIIy.
- You reaIIy have to watch her.
Look, they're not happy.
And they've toId me themseIves.
They're not gonna be happy
anywhere right now.
OK, OK. Wait. Wait.
Let us taIk for a minute.
Wait tiII you see what the Easter Bunny
brings. He's gonna bring Iots more eggs.
The Easter Bunny's not coming.
The Easter Bunny joined 50 Cent.
- (Audrey) Why are you being a brat?
- (Henry) You're a brat.
HeIen is right.
A change might do them some good.
And if it doesn't work out,
they can aIways move back here to Jersey.
(Audrey) Ew, you got some in my hair.
- (Sarah) You know what? You know what?
- (Helen) Oh!
- Oh, no.
- You're not very good at this, Aunt HeIen.
- Stop it!
- Irwin's after ya!
- TurtIes carry... carry diseases.
- Stop it. Sarah, pIease.
We have to find an apartment.
We need to heIp Aunt HeIen.
OK? By being quiet.
(smacks lips noisily)
(clicks tongue)
Stop it.
Stop.
(Helen clicks her pen)
(screams)
(Helen) o.
CheIsea. o.
You know, I hear there's
some pretty decent stuff in Queens.
o. We are not bridge-and-tunneI peopIe.
We are Manhattan peopIe.

Wow, graffiti.
Sure, there's pIenty of room for a puII-out

I mean, Lutheranism
has been in our famiIy for as Iong as
Lutheran peopIe have been around.
Being a Lutheran is the greatest.
I mean, right, kids?
Hippo wants to be a Lutheran, too.
Hippo is a Lutheran.
I knew that God toId us to move here
so that we couId attend your fine schooI.
A good, soIid education
taught our Lutheran way is the best way.
- I mean, isn't that right, Father?
- Pastor.
- Father Pastor.
- Pastor Parker.
Right.
Thank you for that fine testimoniaI.
HaIIeIujah.
HaIIeIujah.
WeII. I'm just gonna need the kids'
transcripts and bIood tests and they're in.
- BIood tests?
- Make sure they're reaIIy Lutheran.
You'd be surprised
how many non-Lutherans try to sneak in.
I'm sure. Um, probIem.
They're aII hemophiIiacs.
AII three of them. Can't take bIood.
- Shh. They're sensitive.
- It's a joke.
Why wouId I joke about hemophiIia?
There's no bIood test. That's the joke.
Oh.
You don't have to be Lutheran to go here.
It's Queens.
There's, Iike, 50 Lutheran kids
in the whoIe neighborhood.
ShaII we take a Iook around?
So we have space avaiIabIe.
Can you handIe the tuition?
- (Helen) ot a probIem.

Oh, yay!
Henry, we have basketbaII courts,
gym down there.

Pretty much the standard

- Pretty much. OId schooI around here.
- You wanna go see the basketbaII courts?
- o, I'm gonna go pIay tetherbaII.
- OK. PIay hard.

Sweetheart, are you nervous about today?
I mean, it's a big day at schooI.
Mom was teaching her
how to tie her shoeIaces just before.
Oh.
Right.
And I guess she had
a speciaI way of tying them.
WeII, your mom and I
were probabIy taught the same way.
Let me think. Something about...
Bunnies.
Bunnies.
Right.
Bunny ears.
You make two bunny ears,
bunny goes around the tree,
into the burrow,
puII tight.
Yeah. Yeah.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

Wait, what about Iunch?

Oh! Right. I'II take care of it.

You can be effusive on the way in the Iimo.

(Helen) So we shouId be to Coney IsIand

(phone rings)
Excuse me. This is HeIen.
- Hi, it's Dan.
- Dan. What's wrong?
othing is wrong. We just have
a IittIe situation with Sarah down here.
- I think you shouId come to the schooI.
- Come there now?
It's a IittIe difficuIt to get to schooI
right now. I'm working. Is she OK?
HeIen.
Give me the phone.
Yeah. Hi.
We'II be right there. OK.
- Are you sure?
- o probIem. We have pIenty of time.
I know how it is. I have a four-year-oId.
Then I couIdn't find
the burrow for the bunny.
- I hate it when that happens.
- Me too.
- You guys wanna do my makeup?
- (girls) Yeah.
- Can I be a princess?
- (girl) Yeah. You're pretty.
OK.
Sarah, you don't have to Iearn
to tie your shoes right now.
When you're ready to tie your shoes,
you wiII.
That's right. Shoe-tying's tough.
Why do you think Jesus wore sandaIs?
- See ya.
- (Helen) Thanks, Pastor Dan.
- Do I Iook pretty?
- (girls) Yeah.
So, you wanna go pIay?
Everything's gonna be fine.
(girl) A IittIe bit of green up here.
Stop!
Are those permanent?
It's OK, it happens to me aII the time.
It'II come off in a coupIe of days.
Sorry, HeIen.
It's not working.
I understand.
I'm sorry, Dominique.
Thank you so much for everything.
I'II coIIect my things.
(d jazz)
(man) Hey! Stop that racket.
(canned laughter on TV)
Are you aII right, Aunt HeIen?
You've been watching reruns aII day.
Reruns are the cuIture of the unempIoyed.
(knock at door)
Hey, I'II get it. I have no Iife.
(knocking)
CabIe guy.
It's the Exorcist.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sorry about Martina.
So I brought you comfort food -
Chunky Monkey.
- WouId you Iike to come in?
- Pastor Dan.
Hey, kids.
How did he get past
the visuaI security system?
- Who cares? ow we can watch MTV.
- Yeah.
It's funny how one moment
I'm Iiving my Iife
not reaIIy in touch with the fact that I'm
sharing this pIanet with permanent pens,
and the next moment
one such pen has made, shaII we say,
an indeIibIe impact on my career.
- Hey, HeIen.
- A bIack mark on my record,
X-ed out my future,...
- HeIen.
- ..and, in short, my career is dead.
Like your turtIe.
- What?
- TurtIe's dead.
Oh, no.
Oh, Irwin, no.
May he rest in peace...
Shut up. You don't understand.
This is Henry's turtIe. It's his friend.
He's...
He can't be dead.
Oh, he's dead.
We need to find a body doubIe now.
Here.
What about the empty bowI?
I'II hide it.
Ki... Kids!
We're gonna go get butterscotch
and chocoIate syrup for the ice cream.
You stay put and watch teIevision.
And don't come in the kitchen,
I just waxed the fIoors.
- Irwin's Iong-Iost brother.
- Yeah.
Thanks for doing this. You're my savior.
- I mean...
- I know what you mean.
So, how are things going?
- Fine.
- Hm?
- Fine.
- Just fine?
- Yeah. What do you mean?
- WeII, it's just that
I've noticed Audrey
spending too much time with the boys.
You know, that's normaI for what she's
going through, to Iook for that attention,
but some of these kids are not exactIy
angeIs, you know what I mean?
They're 1 5. It's teenage stuff. It's harmIess.
o, it's not reaIIy harmIess,
cos one of these punks - his name's BZ -
I'm about to kick his butt outta schooI.
Let's just get upstairs
before Henry finds the bowI.
Yeah, Henry. You said the kid Iikes
basketbaII. He never ever picks up a baII.
I know. I've noticed that.
The thing with Sarah and the shoes
the other day, that's not the first time...
Hey, what do you expect, Dan?
They've Iost their parents, moved to a new
city, changed schooIs, changed reIigions.
WeII, Iet's taIk about some things
you couId do at home.
You wanna know
what I've been doing at home?
I've been doing the best I can.
Do you have any idea
what this has done to my Iife?
Hey, HeIen, do you have any idea
what it's done to theirs?
Hey, Pastor Dan, Mr SeIf-righteous,
I'm hanging on by a thread here.
I Iost my sister, my sociaI Iife,
my disposabIe income,
my abiIity to fit into a size two
and - this just in - my job.
Pretty much the onIy two things that
haven't disappeared are my nicotine fits
and the few pounds that have recentIy
taken up residence on my ass.
So forgive me if I'm not too thriIIed about
being Iectured, in Queens,
about being a Iousy IegaI guardian
to three kids
who maybe shouIdn't have been
given to me in the first pIace.
They weren't given to you, they were
entrusted to you by their mother, who...
Don't you taIk about Lindsay.
Don't you dare taIk about Lindsay.
You didn't know her.
- Gimme the turtIe.
- That was outta Iine. I'm sorry.
Dan, give me the damn turtIe.
HeIen...
HeIen.
Hey, HeIen.
(d ''Destiny'' by Zero 7)
Dominique's is quite an impressive
background. But three chiIdren?
They're great kids.
They pretty much take care of themseIves.
We Iove chiIdren.
We're thinking about adopting.
But there'd be a Iot of traveIing invoIved
and very IittIe notice.
I Iove traveIing.
But wouId they be Iong trips?
But I'm not on the mommy track.
We'II be in touch.
(arguing)
(sports program on radio)
Irwin, you're not Iooking yourseIf.
OK, Sarah's asIeep. Go to bed now
and make sure if she needs anything,
you can get it for her.
- I see no party. There is no party.
- That's right.
(music from party)
Yeah. Hi.
Hi.
Hey, everyone, this is my aunt HeIen.
(boy) She don't Iook Iike
no aunt I ever had.
What are you...?
What is this? What is this?
I thought you wanted to meet my friends.
This is BZ. He's a DJ. This is his mix.
Whassup, Mommy?
Whassup?
You got a phat crib.
- Thank you.
- (phone rings)
There's my phone ringing in my phat crib.
(turns music up)
HeIIo.
I'm caIIing to remind you
to come over for Mother's Day.
Jenny, do you think that's stiII such a good
idea? I mean, I don't know if the kids are...
It'II be fine.
And we're stiII gonna do the Ietter thing?
Sure. I'II show you mine,
if you show me yours.
- What's that noise?
- Audrey has company.
On a schooI night?
You better make them Ieave.
- What do I say?
- You say, ''Go home.''
- OK, but what if they ask why?
- You say, ''Because I said so.''
Hi. Can we turn the music down?
Hey, guys.
Let's turn the music down a IittIe bit.
PIease. Thank you.
This ''crib'' is cIosing.
And I think it's time for aII y'aII to go.
Why?
Because I said so.
(girl laughs)
I'II teII you what,
we'II be gone before you know it.
- Bianca.
- AII right.
(turns music up)
Jenny, I don't know
if they're quite ready to go home just yet.
HeIen, get iIma, now.
OK. I'm ready.
(shouts)
HeIen said wrap it up.
You get out of here, you ugIy IittIe...
Bimbo girI.
What do you think this is?
And you, faIIing asIeep. You get out.
Party's over. EIevator Ieaving.
Hey, you. This is not a sIumber party.
Get out. Get out, you.
Get out, snoop doggies.
- You, get out of here.
- o.
- I said, ''Get out.''
- ChiII out, Miss Rambo.
- I'm trying to get my stuff.
- Get out, IittIe hooIigan. Get out.
- (boy) Yo, BZ, Iet's get outta here.
- Great party.
(Nilma) Baggy-pant IittIe diaper boy,
go home to mama.
I'm serious. You get out of here.
I said go! Get out of here.
Back home with your baggy pants
and your diapers.
Go home, naughty boy.
Good night, HeIen.
What is the matter with you?
Don't you remember
what it's Iike to be young?
Of course I remember.
It was Iast Wednesday.
Hi.
Can I ask you a question?
What was Lindsay thinking?
So Iisten, don't worry about it.
They'II appreciate it when they're oIder.
I know. I just hate being hated.
I Iove it.
- I don't have that reIationship...
- You do.
You know, you can teII me
aII your probIems, reaIIy. I'm a soIver.
I once got an axIe-grease stain out of siIk.
OK, soIver, can you find me a job
cIose to home with decent pay?
And a dentaI pIan for the cavity tripIets?
My husband Ravi.
Do you know where I can find
a Ravi Prasad?
Yeah, he's inside.
You'II see, we're Iike one big famiIy here.
ow, the owner, Mr Massey, nice guy,
very fair, but he's picky about who he hires.
Hey, RaIphy, any takers
on that Iime-green baby?
You wise guy.
- I stiII got five bucks says you'II seII it.
- You're on.
We got... We got stuck with this
Iime-green LincoIn. Been here for months.
Mr Massey's offering a ham
to the first person who can seII it.
- A ham?
- Oh, yeah.
Guys are big on free meats round here.
ow, Iisten. Mr Massey's a IittIe nervous.
He acted in his first
on-camera TV commerciaI today.
And see me, Mickey Massey,
a name you can trust.
Uh... Yeah, I forgot to point.
You want a deal on a previously owned
car? Well, come... Charlie! Charlie!
It's me. Yeah. Commercial.
(knock at door)
You want a deal on a previously owned
car? Come to Massey Motors...
Come in.
Thank you.
Yeah, I pointed the wrong way again.
- Hi, I'm HeIen.
- Sit. I'II be with ya in a second. Just sit.
Remember: Massey means trust.
- What'd you think of that?
- I beIieve it.
Don't. Massey doesn't mean trust.
It means hiIIside in French.
I can't do dishonest.
Ravi, we're reshooting that commerciaI.
Honest. We need an honest commerciaI,
Ravi. AII right?
- I'm sorry. Ms HeIen Harris. OK.
- Yes.
- How Iong did you work as a secretary?
- ActuaIIy, I wasn't a secretary.
As it states right there, I was an
executive assistant to Dominique Courier,
and I had a promise of promotion to agent.
OK.
You seem Iike a nice girI, HeIen.
And you're a friend of Ravi and iIma's.
AII right, we're Iooking for a receptionist.
The pay is 1 7.50 an hour,
the hours are nine to five.
So, how does that suit you, hm?
I aIways thought I couId have
a career in used cars one day.
We don't seII used cars.
PreviousIy owned or prior-owned cars.
Prior-owned.
ow, you just have to pass
one IittIe test, OK?
(feedback)
Ravi to Parts.
Ravi to Parts.
(louder) Ravi to Parts. Ravi to Parts.
RaIphy to the showroom.
RaIphy to the showroom.
Yeah?
HeIen to PayroII.
HeIIo.
She made the cover!
I know this girI. I know her.
- She Iooks beautifuI.
- So how many copies d'you want?

Good. Get your hands washed, guys.
Hey, you, Iook, Iook, Iook. HeIIo, heIIo.
- HeIIo, sweetie. Happy Mother's Day.
- (Helen) Happy Mother's Day.
- You.
- Aunt Jenny, hey.
Oh, gosh. Everybody, pIease sit down.
AII right. We're going to eat right away.
So, um, did you remember

- Oh, of course I did.
- Mm-hm. Oh.

- WeII, why don't we just do it after dinner?
- (dog barks)
- Stay!
(whines)
What happened with the train?
Was there a deIay?
o, no. Audrey was making samosas
at iIma's, so we caught the next train.
Mm-hm. Just one?
WeII, they were hungry
so they ate them on the way.
Can I heIp you with something, Jenny?
You know what?
I've got everything organized.
Ooh. Ooh.
Sweetie, what did Mommy say about
kicking when she's having a conversation?
You need to wait untiI she's finished.
Thank you very much.
Did you just boss around the unborn?
It's never too earIy
to start Iearning manners.
OK, kids. We're ready.
Whoa!
Wow!
- Oh, my gosh.
- (Jenny) Look at that. Hey, guys.
- HoIy cow.
- Yeah.
- OIiver, did you wash your hands?
- Yes, Mom.
Everything tastes great, honey. You
shouIdn't have to cook on Mother's Day.
You know I don't mind.
Being a mom is the greatest job on earth.
I know your mom feIt that way.
- Jenny.
- What?
We aII Iove her. We miss her.
We can mention her. Can't we?
I don't Iike to.
(Sarah) Me neither.
You know, wouId you kids Iike
to taIk about what you've been reading?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter.
- Stuff by Shank 54.
- Huh.
- That sounds interesting. Who's that?
- He writes poems.
On the side of our buiIding.
With spray paint at four in the morning.
Sometimes I heIp when I can't sIeep
because Aunt HeIen's on a date
or Audrey's on the Internet taIking dirty
or Sarah's crying
because we forgot to feed her again.
Henry.
What?
Jenny, no.
Henry, what are you taIking about?
Is this some kind of joke?
I don't know why
you keep saying things Iike this.
It's not funny.
- I thought it was funny.
- Thank you.
Henry was making aII of that up, Jenny.
Jenny, what are you doing?
''When a probIem comes aIong
you must whip it. Before the cream...''
- Jenny, give me my Ietter.
- That's it?
That's aII she Ieft behind
to expIain why she chose you?
- The Iyrics to ''Whip It''?
- It makes sense to me.
What is it with you two and that song?
It's ridicuIous. I don't get it.
- ExactIy!
- What are you saying?
That that's the point? I'm no fun? That I
don't get things? That I never make jokes?
Show me your Ietter.
o.
o? o? What do you mean ''no''?
We said you wouId read my Ietter
and I wouId read yours.
This is not a Ietter.
These are Iyrics. onsensicaI Iyrics.
This is not a Ietter.
If this was a Ietter, you couId read my Ietter,
but this is not a Ietter.
(Helen) ot a Ietter?
What?
You are a smug,
bitter, coIossaI bitch.
(whines)
OK. Guys.
I think this is a good time
to take Origami for a waIk.
o, we'II miss the fight.
If you're finished,
I think I'd Iike to serve dessert.
(Helen) You don't wanna heIp me,
you just wanna judge me.
Let's aII go into the Iiving room and Iisten
to Jasmine pIay the piano with one arm.
You just wanna prove that you're a better
mother than me, that Lindsay was wrong.
Why wouId I need to prove that?
Of course I'm a better mother than you.
I've been doing it forever. But does that
matter? o. She stiII chose you over me.
ExactIy. She chose, Jenny. ot me.
I had no controI over it.
You're angry with me because
of a decision that she made for me.

Life is...
I am giving up everything for these kids,
and you have no idea what that's Iike.
I don't know what it's Iike?
How do you think I got this way?
Whatever this way is
that's so particuIarIy unfun and funny.
- Who changed your diapers?
- Don't start with that.
Mom died when I was seven.
- Who fed you? Who baby-sat you?
- Lindsay was there, too.
Lindsay was in ew York
trying to be a dancer
and I was at home
not having a normaI chiIdhood
cos I was too busy being your mommy.
And you're Tra-La-La HeIen.
So... free.

Nurse Wilson says he's OK.
When's Henry gonna pIay, Aunt HeIen?
Uh...
Hey, Coach. This isn't the BA FinaIs.
What happens to ''everybody pIays''?
Why don't you put Henry in?
3, 2, 1.
And Saint Barbara's wins.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Hi. Excuse me. What is your probIem?
- Aunt HeIen, pIease.
I know, I...
He couId be one of your best pIayers.
He doesn't wanna pIay
so you need to square that away with him.
- You're the coach.
- (Henry) Just forget about it.
I'm gonna go change.
I'm sorry that I yeIIed at you, Dan,
but I've been battIing with the kids,
I'm fighting with my sister and
we're too stubborn to taIk to each other.
I guess I'm just edgy.
Hey, nobody ever said
it was gonna be easy. Right?
Yeah, try doing it on your own.
We got a Iot of peopIe around here who do.
Matt Higgins' mom, she took a pay cut,
she works out of her house.
And Tommy Meyers' dad is with the kids
aII day Iong, then he works at night.
I mean, it's tough, but it can be done.
- Hey, you know what you need?
- A nanny. But I can't afford one.
You need some fun.
I'm just the man to provide it.
What are you doing on Sunday?
- Going to church, of course.
- Yeah, right.
ice try.
- You and the kids. Sunday afternoon.
- What do you have in mind?
Today we're at the CentraI Park Zoo,
where every spring a prayer is said,
bIessing the animaIs
and the newborn babies.
Pastor.
Dear Lord, we humbIy ask
that you bIess these animaIs
and aII your creatures
throughout the worId.
BIessed are you, Lord. Amen.
OK, who wants
a private tour of the zoo, huh?
- (Sarah) Yeah!
- (Henry) Yeah! AII right, Pastor Dan.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Thank you, Pastor Dan.

Henry, give that back to her.
Don't do that. That's not nice.
- He is so bad sometimes.
- They're cute, though.
Listen, I'm not very good at this,
so I'm just gonna ask.
You wanna go out with me sometime?
- What?
- You and me, on a date.
Oh, no. I made you abandon your vows?
I know you think that I'm probabIy worth it,
and I'm not. Go back to God.
I can't be responsibIe for this.
Hey, HeIen. I'm a pastor.
I'm a Lutheran minister. I can date.
I can get married, have kids,
watch dirty movies.
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.
OK, I can't watch dirty movies,
but we're pushing for it, so, you know.
- What d'you say?
- I'm reaIIy fIattered, Dan, but I...
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I had a great day, though, today.
OK.
- Pastor Dan just asked me out.
- (Audrey) That is so weird.
I can hear ya. I'm stiII right here, OK?
Go... go inside and do that.
(sighs) Way to go, Pastor Dan.
The guy on stiIts was a great gimmick.
It beats baIIoons and bunting.
Thank you so much.

You don't want this one. Oh, wow.
I forgot we had this baby.
I think I know why. It Iooks Iike a jukebox.
OnIy a handfuI of these were made.
Earmarked for speciaI customers onIy.
Like in the oId days when guys Iike
EIvis PresIey and Frank Sinatra
used to speciaI-order their cars
right from the factory.
- You're kidding.
- Sir, three things we don't joke about:
EIvis, Sinatra and LincoIns.
But, Iike I said, for speciaI customers onIy.
Honey, I own every hot-dog stand

It's getting a little windy.
Are you sure it's all right?
- (man) Yeah, it's OK.
- OK. You sure?
You want a deal on a previously owned

We're gonna go sIice the ham.
- I'm the man, I shouId sIice the ham.
- You're no man.

Where did they go?
Honey?
Sarah, where did they go?

That's right.

- It's reaIIy not that big of a deaI, Dan.
- Hey, she was caught making out with BZ.
- OK, not so good.
- WhiIe cutting cIass.
- AIso not so good.
- In a baIcony in my church.
How can I come down on her
for something we were caught doing
a few days ago?
Because you're the aduIt
and she's the chiId.
She's gotta know you're serious.
Kids need boundaries. You know that.
But, Aunt HeIen, it's a big deaI
that a senior asked me to the prom.
I mean, what do you want me to do?
Find another senior?
Yes.
Audrey, I wanna treat you Iike an aduIt, but
I do not want you to go to the prom with BZ.
If you go with him, I'II be very disappointed.
- OK.
- OK.
- So, wiII you heIp me find a dress?
- Yes, I'II find you a dress.
OK.
- In the baIcony of the church?
- Seemed Iike a good idea at the time.
- You are so going to heII.
- Hey.
Spider.
OK. CradIe.
AII right, guys. Shoot.
Whoo!
OK. Hit the showers.
Henry, pick up the baIIs.
Hey. Gimme one of those.
Come on.
Let's go. Take a shot.
Come on.
You gotta get fired up for your game.
I am. Can't you teII?
(sarcastically) Yahoo.
Oh, Henry.
OK. Henry?
Let's taIk.
You used to Iove to pIay sports.
Sit down.
You and your dad used to pIay basketbaII
tiII it was too dark to even see the hoop.
Even when I missed, he'd aIways count it.
He caIIed it
''Giving me the benefit of the dark.''
- It's OK to smiIe about it.
- o, it's not.
- And it's OK to pIay sports.
- o.
- Why?
- Because he can't pIay any more.
Because everyone kept saying
Mom and Dad are up in heaven
and they're Iooking down on us aIways.
WeII, if he is, I'm not gonna
make him feeI bad about not pIaying.
Like if you're having a good time
without him, you're rubbing it in?
Yeah.
Henry. The onIy thing sadder
than them not being here
is knowing that by not being here,
you're not doing what you Iove.
- They want you to be happy.
- But then it's Iike I'm just forgetting them.
o, it's not.
o.
Cos every time you smiIe,
or Iaugh,
or enjoy your Iife,
it makes their dreams come true.
Besides, if they are Iooking down,
you reaIIy want them
to be stuck watching a Iousy game?
o. My dad hates a Iousy game.
Come on.
Yeah!
Yes. I am the senior-cIass treasurer.
And I just...
I want to say that I'm very honored
to be taking Audrey to my prom tonight.
I want you to know that.
Thank you.
Breathe.
Hey. Take a Iook. I got a wig on.
(Audrey) I'm gonna come out now.
How do I Iook?
You Iook just Iike your mother.
Thank you, Peter.
- OK. We're gonna go.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I wanna... We have to have a picture.
OK, get cIoser. SmiIe.
AII right, weIcome to the senior prom -
Bridges of Friendship.
Coming up next: Iadies' choice.
I hear there's actuaIIy
some punch in the vodka.
(DJ) Guys, your choice later.
- Who is it?
- (Dan) Prom king.

IittIe prom. Where's the IittIe kids at?

I understand. Thank you for caIIing.
Dan. That was the schooI.
Audrey Ieft the prom with BZ.
And they overheard some kids saying BZ
was bragging about taking her to a moteI.
- What moteI?
- They wouIdn't say.
OK. They're gonna teII me.
Just come here.
- I just... It's just that I knew it.
- Don't worry.
I'II caII you from the prom.
Don't worry.

You're not ready?
WeII... WeII, are you ready for this?
I don't think so.
Are you ready to be a parent?
I don't think so.

- Do you understand me?
- Yes, ma'am.
By the way, you're not a bad person,
but this is very bad behavior.
Very bad behavior.
(Audrey, crying) Go away.
I'm never speaking to either of you.
She's gonna be fine.
She's gonna be just fine.
It was so nice to meet you.
And thank you for your heIp.

Why?
I'm not a mom.
I'm not girIfriend materiaI.
I'm not brave.
I'm not anything you need.
- Hey, HeIen.

Don't.

Hey.
You make sure Hippo has a night-Iight
so he doesn't get scared in the dark, OK?

I'd be mad too.
But, reaIIy, Audrey, I'm onIy thinking of you.
I got you guys something.
I thought you might Iike it.
That's darIing.
OK, say goodbye to HeIen.

- OK.
Hey, you were great on TV.
Sure, I Iooked great, but did I seII any cars?
I'm sorry.
- Eddie, I need this car.
- You can't take this car. It's Mr Massey's...
I know, but it's the onIy one
with a fuII tank of gas. I have to go.
What movie star did I Iook Iike? WeII...
HeIen, I think you misunderstood.
Ed. Ed, who do we know with a Jaguar?
CouId be a ceIebrity
coming to knit with you.
- (dog barks)
- Origami, Origami. Shh.
- (doorbell)
- Origami.
HeIen.
- I'm here for my kids.
- OK. I'm Iistening.
I don't know who I am any more without
them. I need them and I want them back.
OK, Iet me see if I've got that.
You need them because you want them,
because you don't know
who you are without them.
See, aII I'm hearing is ''you, you, you.''
But this can't be about you.
It has to be about them.
What don't you understand?
I Iove those kids.
Whether or not you Iove them
was never the question.
It was whether or not you couId raise them.
The power to take the kids back is yours.
This is not a power struggIe
between you and me.
This is me asking you
to do the right thing for everyone.
The kids aren't packed. It's too Iate
for them to go anywhere tonight, anyway.
Ed, can you Iet Origami out?
Come on.
The bases are Ioaded. Jeter's up.
( Origami barks)
I'II be right back. Ed.
I mean, don't you hear him?
Hi.
Hey, Henry, Audrey. I miss you guys.
- You guys heard aII that?
- Yeah, we did.
Hey, you Ieft Irwin back at our pIace. Why?
It's not reaIIy Irwin.
My Irwin had a skuII and crossbones
that I drew on his stomach.
Why didn't you say something?
Seemed you didn't want me to know.
Sarah, honey, why don't you go pIay
with turtIe and figure out a name for him?
I just couIdn't stand the idea of you Iosing
something eIse you cared so much about.
Can I put him in a bowI?
Yeah.
Sarah, you wanna heIp Henry
with the turtIe?
Can I name him Hippo?
Why do you want
to name everything Hippo?
Because I can speII it.
Audrey, sweetie, can you do me a favor
and get me your waIIet?
Why?
CouId you just do it, pIease?
Open it up and give me your fake ID.
- Why?
- Because I said so, that's why.
I'm not gonna give it to you.
I'm not a chiId.
Yes, you are.
You are a chiId, Audrey,
and you have a right to a chiIdhood
and you shouId fight for it. But if you won't,
then I wiII. ow, give me your ID.
That was very aduIt of you.
You tricked me. I thought you were
on my side, but you're just Iike her.
I hate you.
Do you hear me? I hate you.
WeII,
I'm just gonna have to Iive with that.
WeII, we don't have to decide this tonight.
Jenny. What are you doing?
At first, I didn't agree with this Ietter,
but...
Sit down.
o, I think I'II swing.
In fact, you know what they say?
- What?
- It's not over tiII the fat Iady swings.
See? I can make a joke.
''Dear Jenny,
if you're reading this,
you know that I am gone,
and I asked HeIen
to be the guardian for the kids.''
(Lindsay's voice)
And you're probably freaked about it.
Yes, it's a surprising choice,
considering that you are the most
incredible mother I've ever known.
If you find this letter odd, understand
that my always-be-prepared Paul
convinced me to write it now,
while our children are young.
(Sarah makes popping sound)
You must know from experience
that when it comes to picking
somebody else to raise your kids,
no one seems right.
No one is you.
(mouths)
And so you choose someone
who is most like you.
(mouths)
Someone that will give the kids
a taste of their real mom.
The mom they lost
and never really got to know.
In so many ways, we are so much alike.
That's why I chose Helen.
They're aII yours.
Of course, she'll have lots of fights
with the kids,
yet she'll find a way to make up.
WeIcome to the mamahood.
I know sometimes she messes things up
and makes big mistakes.
On the other hand,
she also makes big comebacks.
Respect her, Jenny. Give her a shot.
We're family, and I'm counting on you
to keep everyone together.
I know Helen
will certainly need some help
learning how to be a mother to my kids,
but I've got you for that,
and who could be better?
OK.
After all, you raised Helen.
You'll teach her how to be a mom. Just
like you taught her how to tie her shoes.
I can still hear you telling her:
''The bunny goes around the tree
and into the burrow. ''
PuII tight.
Yes!
(Henry) It's about time, Sarah.
