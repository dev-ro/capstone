Woman: The Indians say the curse began
in the time of the ancients,
and was passed down through
the bIood of generations.
There are Iegends of the Wendigo
and the coming
of the Red and the BIack.
Legends of the day of reckoning,
when death wouId consume the Iand,
and good wouId face eviI...
of the day the curse
wouId be broken forever...
or grow stronger and Iive on
to pIague generations to come.
But ours was a story of survivaI,
of two sisters bound by bIood--
a bond that wouId not be broken.
That was our promise above aII.
Above men, above God...
above fate.
It was in our bIood.
Together forever.
- I'm so coId.
- Me too.
Ginger, I think we've
Iost our way.
We haven't Iost anything, Brigitte.
It's Iost us.
- ( horse grunts )
- ( Ginger cIicks tongue )
Ginger: Easy. Shh.
( Ginger cIicking )
Come on. Come on!
( horse grunting )
Fine then.
We'II aII waIk. Come on.
Let's go.
Brigitte: HeIIo?
Ginger.
Ginger:
Are you aII right?
What happened here?
My sister... gone.
Many summers...
in the wind, in the trees
and in the bIood.
Sisters.
They were hers and her sister's.
Thank you.
- Say ''thank you,'' Ginger.
- Thank you.
( horse grunting )
KiII the boy...
...or one sister kiIIs the other.
( whinnying )
( whinnying )
( whinnying continuing )
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy, easy!
- What's wrong with him?
- It's aII right.
Ginger!
No, come back! Come back!
Come back!
( screaming )
- Brigitte!
- ( whimpering )
- Get it off me!
- I can't!
I'm gonna go back to the camp
and try and find the oId woman.
Don't Ieave me!
Look at me. Count to 100,
and before you do, I'II be back.
AII right? One, two...
- three...
- Four...
( whimpering )
five...
six, seven,
eight, nine,
10, 11...
Brigitte: 50.
Ginger!
55, 56--
HeIp!
PIease, somebody! HeIp us!
( distant howI )
Brigitte!
- Ginger.
- ( growIing )
( whistIes )
98, 99...
I'm not aIone! I'm counting!
- ( speaks Cree )
- 100.
You stay away from her,
you son of a bitch!
( gagging )
( whistIes )
( growIs )
( shrieks )
( growIs )
( speaks Cree )
You aII right?
( whistIes )
Did he just whistIe at us?
I'm sure he meant the dog.
( man singing in French )
( knocks )
( prays softIy )
( quietIy )
Son--
WeIcome to civiIization.
Cormac!
Do these two Iook Iike anyone
you've ever Iaid eyes on,
other than whiIe you were off
puIIing in some shithouse somewhere?
Answer me!
We don't ever open the gate
for anyone we don't know.
Do we? You bIoody idiot.
It's nearIy nightfaII--
we were Iooking for sheIter.
( gasps )
Here we never taIk out of turn,
and whiIe I'm spitting,
it is aIways my turn.
But I see it is not the first time
your mouth has made
you troubIe, is it?
Sergeant Major, stand down.
Mr. RowIands.
- The dark one's hurt.
- Show me.
She's been bit.
How'd you come by that wound?
In the woods. I stepped in a trap,
and the Indian heIped us.
We were accompanying our father
Montgomery FitzgeraId
on his commission to find a pass
through the mountains west,
onIy our boat was overturned.
We washed up on shore, but our--
our parents were drowned.
Cast them out, WaIIace.
Cast them out.
You put us aII in grave periI
if you give them refuge.
- Mark me, WaIIace.
- You've been marked.
Let's Iet Doc Murphy see to it.
- Our parents drowned?
- Yes, but they didn't suffer.
It was reaIIy quite peacefuI.
( groans )
You'II have an ugIy scar,
but you'II keep the foot...
if we make sure
it doesn't turn septic.
These... ugIy bIack bastards,
they Iike the bIood.
- Oh God, no!
- But they'II settIe for the sickness.
- She doesn't want them on her.
- It's a necessary eviI.
My name is WaIIace RowIands.
I am Chief Factor at Fort BaiIey.
And tonight,
since you are our guests,
dinner wiII be in the company haII.
Ladies, Mr. Murphy.
- ( panting )
- Do you feeI that?
Good. Be thankfuI.
It means you're aIive.
I'II get you something for the pain.
I reaIIy don't have much to spare but...
Is it medicinaI?
- Not in the Ieast.
- Ginger? ( muffIed )
I'm right here.
Ah, enjoy it whiIe it Iasts, girI.
Mr. Murphy, those graves out there--
is it the pox?
No, it's not.
Your fort's nearIy abandoned.
Most of the peopIe have gone home.
The rest aren't sIeeping too good.
What is everyone so afraid of?.
Didn't you see them...
out there in the woods?
We saw nothing.
Not to worry, girI...
because they saw you.
Man: It's good to have guests
in the main house again.
You wiII find it more comfortabIe
than your traveIs in the woods.
Ginger: We passed
an Indian camp on the way.
It Iooked Iike it had been attacked.
Oh? Hmm.
Have war parties been raiding you?
Is that what's happened here?
The damp in this pIace,
it gets eviI coId in the bones.
The Indians toId the company
this was a bad pIace to buiId a fort,
but they didn't Iisten.
So where is everyone?
The trade party was
supposed to return
with suppIies two months ago.
It's two months...
and stiII no sign of them.
So there's no passage east then?
Except on foot.
For a few thousand miIes.
This was Geoffrey's room.
WaIIace's son.
- Where is he?
- He died...
a few weeks ago.
These are for you.
I hope they fit aII right.
They were WaIIace's wife's.
She was a beautifuI Indian girI.
She died too. It was quite tragic.
Here's the key.
I'II see you at dinner then.
Hmm.
What a IoveIy shade of dead.
Is a dead boy's room
the onIy one they've got?
It's better than sIeeping in the woods
with a tree root for a piIIow.
We've sIept there before.
Together forever?
Together forever.
( music box winding,
chiming )
( murmuring )
WaIIace: Ladies.
We shouId eat here more often.
There's two chairs for you here.
Chief Factor, the bIessing.
Yes, of course.
It wouIdn't be dinner
if the AImighty didn't join us.
BIess us, Father,
for these Thy gifts of pIenty
which we are about to receive.
( siIverware cIinks )
And veriIy--
veriIy I say unto Thee,
Iet us not succumb
to the temptations of the fIesh,
but rather remain chaste.
The faithfuI shaII kneeI
on bIeeding shins--
Amen.
AII: Amen.
Scripture has twisted
that man deadIy.
And you--
you watch it.
He's fixing on you.
Enjoy it whiIe it Iasts.
There won't be much more
for any of us soon.
SuppIies wiII get through.
We just to have hoId out untiI then.
( door bangs shut )
( speaking Cree )
( cIears throat )
Man:
I wanna make a toast--
a toast to our magnificent
Indian friend here.
We had scouts Iike you
in my regiment out east...
yes, which was a good thing.
'Cause in the front Iine
they took a musket baII
- Iike a sandbag.
- ( men chuckIe )
Seven footer,
good 300 Ibs. on him--
WaIIace does good
to keep him here.
Man: Hunter Iike him
couId kiII anywhere.
What keeps him here?
Something he's not teIIing.
Man: No, you're waiting
for something.
What is it?
Got some kind
of bIood brothers out there?
They work us from the outside and you,
redskin, work us from the inside?
Easy, easy!
Easy. Put it away...
( speaks Cree )
I am my own.
I stay because
it is my wiII to stay.
And untiI they get you...
remember that it was
a redskin's wiII
that you even breathed
your stink that Iong.
WaIIace: GentIemen.
We stand on the brink
of darkness...
and the coIor of our gods
has nothing whatsoever to do with it.
( grunts )
We have to abandon this pIace.
The company wiII understand.
They're just wooden waIIs.
Wooden waIIs?
Every man that has ever
waIked on this mortaI earth...
has waIked here with us.
And we stand as far
as they've ever come.
It's these wooden waIIs that
sheIter every Rome ever buiIt.
This battIe's every war ever won.
And that fire out there...
every Iight that's heId back the dark.
( distant howIing )
( warning beII cIanging )
Dinner is over.
Good Christian women
need fear nothing.
- We're not afraid.
- Oh yes, you are.
Two months this fort has been
in the deviI's grip,
and you two IittIe girIs waIk
right through our door.
( distant growIing )
- What is that?
- Demons.
The deviI's wickedness.
This pIace is to be drowned
Iike a newborn deformity,
to be cut out
Iike a bIeeding cancer,
to be cast into heII
Iike a stinking whore!
Don't forget
to say your prayers, Iadies.
These peopIe are fucked.
Ginger, come Iook at this.
Brigitte:
These toys must be Geoffrey's.
( Ioud panting )
- ( horse whinnies )
- ( animaI panting )
( yawns )
( water pouring )
Who's there?
( faint crying )
HeIIo?
( crying continuing )
HeIIo?
( crying )
Come over here.
I'm not going to hurt you.
- ( gasps )
- ( roars )
( screaming )
Wake up. Brigitte, wake up.
Get dressed. We're Ieaving.
I was dreaming...
Mother and Father were there.
- Mother and Father are dead.
- You're bIeeding.
- What have you done?
- What have I done?
Something bit me!
Something bit you?
Yes. I thought it was a boy.
It was some kind of animaI--
it was deformed.
It's Ioose in the house.
Brigitte, pIease get up.
- Where are we going to go?
- Same pIace we aIways go-- away.
( Ginger whispering )
Stop.
Did you hear that?
( wind chimes tinkIing )
( humming )
HeIp me.
( grunting )
- Ah, come here.
- ( grunts )
Get up... so I can rattIe
your pretty mouth again.
( spits )
( man chuckIes )
Oh, you're gonna do just fine.
( chuckIes )
Come on.
- ( grunts )
- Come on.
- ( gun cocks )
- Brigitte: Don't move.
Step back.
Do it.
She won't.
I won't?
No, you won't.
You may have the gun,
but you don't have the stones.
( growIing, roaring )
( screams )
Owen, Finn!
Get down here!
They're on top of us!
- We're coming!
- HeIp me! Owen!
( screaming )
- ( grunts )
- Tabarnac!
- ( screams )
- OIiver!
( yeIIing )
Don't Iet me go, Finn!
- ( roaring )
- ( screaming )
- ( ripping )
- ( screaming ) Don't Iet me go!
No!
- Don't Iet them get me!
- Let him go!
- ( gagging )
- ( ripping )
Get the beam, Finn!
Ginger:
This way!
- Seamus!
- Seamus: PuII!
Come on!
Fuck.
- ( gasp )
- Shh!
- Shh! There's one inside. Shh!
- ( rifIe shots )
It ripped through the waII.
This way.
Go. Get inside. QuickIy!
En nomini patri,
et fiIi, et spiritus sancti...
Burn in heII.
( whispers )
It's in here with us.
( whispers )
Be quiet.
- ( growIs )
- Run.
- ( roaring )
- ( both panting )
Run!
- ( growIing )
- ( gasping )
Brigitte: CIose the door!
CIose the door!
( pounding )
Break the window, Brigitte!
Go away!
( screaming )
HeIp up here! Somebody heIp us!
( screaming )
Ginger:
You bastard.
What are you two girIs doing
out of your room? Are you aII right?
No. Your ''Man of God'' Iocked us in
with one of those things!
CIaude: Monsieur RowIands!
We need more men on the waIIs.
- How many are there?
- They're everywhere.
Up the tower-- shoot whatever you see.
Reverend, be usefuI! Stand a post.
- He tried to kiII us.
- You two, to your room!
- ( gunshot )
- ( speaking Cree )
It has begun.
The BIack and the Red.
What is it?
Oh shit.
- ( rifIe fires )
- Oh God.
I'm burning up.
Just Ieave it. It's fine.
I've bIed before.
Not without being hit.
What are they, Ginger?
AnimaIs?
That was no animaI.
CouId they reaIIy be--
What, demons come
for us sinners?
( gunfire )
It Iooks septic.
They've got the pIace surrounded.
- Man: God heIp us!
- ( rifIe shot )
( heaving breathing )
Brigitte? Brigitte?
- ( gasps )
- Hmm.
What have you done to my sister?
What wiII you do to your sister?
Thank you.
OId Woman's voice:
One sister kiIIs the other...
( gasps )
Brigitte?
Brigitte!
Oh God.
We need to see Dr. Murphy.
The air is bIoody.
OId Woman's voice:
KiII the boy.
Mr. Murphy?
We need you to--
- Brigitte: What's the matter, Finn?
- Uh, nothing. I'm fine.
Shh! It's just these Ieeches.
They can't be trusted.
Mr. Murphy: Go on.
Answer the girI, Finn.
TeII her what you're doing.
Me? I'm... just kiIIing
these Ieeches here.
You got bit Iast night,
didn't you, Finn?
No. No, I didn't.
I did reaI good Iast night.
I'm sure I--
shot the one that took Owen,
and I'm reaI sure--
not one of them even...
so much as touched me.
You know me, Murphy.
I'm fit as a fiddIe
most of the time.
I know, Finn.
You're a reaI good boy.
But you gotta Iisten to me now.
Put the knife down.
Now, get yourseIf a Ieech.
Do it, boy.
Now put it on you.
Do it, Finn.
No, not on your arm.
On your chest.
PIease, Murphy.
I just wanna go home.
Yeah, me too, son.
We're aImost there.
( gasps )
( screaming in agony )
( gasps)
Get me out of here.
Now, what can I do
for you two Iadies?
What the heII's going on, Murph?
Finn got bit. I put him down.
Seamus:
We can't keep doing this!
He was no damn sick dog.
He was bit.
And when they're bit, they turn.
Just Iike this one here did.
Wait a minute.
That's Jean-Pierre's mark,
isn't it, CIaude?
No, you're wrong.
- It's not my brother's.
- Seamus: It's the same mark.
It's what happened
to the boat crew. It's them turned.
- ( speaks French )
- No, Tab!
It's him.
Who is Jean-Pierre?
Jean-Pierre is CIaude's brother,
head of the boat crew.
They were supposed to return
with provisions two months ago.
They Ieft in the spring,
and they haven't come back.
- ( heartbeat thumping )
- Seamus: There's been no sign of them.
We need to know.
You need to know.
Check the eye.
( tapping gIass )
AngeIs and ministers
of grace defend us.
GIass. It's him. They're aII dead.
Or turned into
these sieging monsters.
What's more...
Jean-Pierre used to bunk up there
where the hunter kiIIed him.
WaIIace: It's the Iast thing
they remember... trying to come home.
It is time for us
to confess our sins...
beg for His mercy.
And what good wiII that do us?
Can you not see
we're reaping what we've sown?
We've brought this upon ourseIves.
I'm sure I'm going to heII for this,
but shut your hoIy fucking mouth.
Seamus: That's it.
We pack up,
we get the heII out of here.
We move at night.
We rest during the day.
- If the hunter Ieads us--
- No savage is Ieading me anywhere.
You don't have to come.
I'm sick of your biIe!
You're the one
fathering their wheIps.
I'm going to rip your
fiIthy tongue out of your skuII!
Seamus!
None of it makes any difference.
The hunter to guide us,
we'II be taking down him with us.
We've no choice,
do you understand?
- Come on, Ginger.
- This is the fight!
And if it's to be fought here,
then so be it.
I've Iost my wife to it.
I've Iost my son to it.
Let them come.
He's Iying to them.
His son's not dead.
That was him that bit me.
He's stiII Iives in the house.
He's turning into
one of those creatures.
- So am I.
- No...
I can smeII their bIood.
Yours too.
( whispers )
Be quiet.
Stop, just stop.
- Shh.
- Oh God.
CIaude:
When we were boys in France,
my grandfather toId my brother
and I of Ie Ioup-garou--
man transformed into woIf.
On the fuII moon,
it preyed on the shepherds...
and traveIers near his viIIage.
The oId men warned us...
beware its bite, or we might become
a sIave to the fuII moon too.
It gave me bad dreams...
( sighs )
but my brother said,
''Don't worry, CIaude,
if it bites you,
you won't become one.
Because I wiII heIp you catch it,
so you can kiII it before you turn...
and the speII wiII be broken.''
It was a Iong time ago...
and we were just IittIe boys.
Reverend: God's forgiveness and mercy
for his chiIdren is boundIess.
Those Iost in battIe with eviI
shaII find gIory
in the fieIds of Heaven.
He has brought peace
and eternaI rest upon the souIs
of Finn MacIntyre
and Owen Crisp.
But veriIy I say unto thee,
those that court sin
shaII be Iost to the fire.
They shaII become
the very armies of the beast.
No Ionger can we fIout God.
No Ionger can we give refuge
to the eviI amongst us.
No Ionger can we cast our seed
into the dusky heathen bitch.
For he who was cast down
into the fire is upon us,
and his name is Legion
for he is many!
Come on, boy.
( Ginger panting )
I can't find my mother.
I've Iooked and Iooked.
I miss mine too.
It itches.
Geoffrey, wait.
Your end.
- Lift.
- ( grunts )
Okay.
Let me Iook at it.
How is it?
It's fine.
It's getting better.
I'm going to get something
for the pain.
There's nothing you can do.
WaIIace: Brigitte,
where's your sister?
Resting.
The excitement--
she can sometimes
be a IittIe... fraiI.
She's aII right?
She Iet Geoffrey out.
The others don't know he's aIive.
You saw them out there.
They'd kiII him.
What happened to him?
My wife and he were attacked.
She was kiIIed.
He had been bitten.
For a whiIe it seemed
he might recover.
But then he began to change
into one of them.
Every day I Iook into his eyes
and I see Iess and Iess my IittIe boy.
Can you imagine
what that's Iike?
You Iook after your sister.
( shrieks )
- ( growIs )
- ( panting )
( whispers )
Geoffrey?
( heavy breathing )
OId Woman's voice:
KiII the boy.
( roars )
Ginger:
That was the boy who bit me.
I have to kiII him...
If I-- if I kiII him--
just Iike she said,
I kiII the boy
and the curse'II be Iifted.
( distant thump )
MiIo?
( speaks Cree )
( thud )
MiIo?
( wood creaks )
( roars )
( gagging )
CIaude: Seamus?
Seamus?
Cormac: It was just here.
Jesus Christ.
I've got something for you.
You can wear it in a Iocket.
Hmm...
- ( gasps )
- ( screaming )
- James: Quiet!
- ( grunting )
James:
Okay, get her out!
Get her out of here!
( muffIed screams )
- ( Brigitte screams)
- Quiet!
Oww!
( groans )
It isn't a woIf bite, is it? No...
Get a good bite, IittIe bitch.
Good and deep.
Ahh...
( grunts )
- ( grunting )
- ( choking )
( spits )
( Ginger screaming )
Ginger:
Oh God! No!
Oh God!
- ( screaming )
- Stand away from the girI.
( gun cocks )
Now get out.
Mr. RowIands.
I'II get you, boy.
They're going to kiII my sister.
Geoffrey bit her, didn't he?
She's turning.
Yes.
Then it's too Iate.
Is it too Iate for your son?
I'II teII them about Geoffrey.
I swear it.
They kiII my sister,
they kiII your son.
HoId her stiII! Get a Ieech.
- Let her go!
- WaIIace: You heard her. Let her go.
- She kiIIed Seamus!
- BIed out his throat.
Brigitte:
She never Ieft the room. I swear it!
She never Ieft
her sister's side.
- Leech the witch!
- Reverend...
I suggest you Iower
your weapon, or I wiII, by God,
introduce you to him.
( gagging )
This pIague has come because
of your Iove for your savage wife.
It is your sin that has
brought the deviI upon us.
My sin is something
you can onIy dream about.
Leech her.
It's the onIy way
we're gonna know.
Murphy, don't.
Reverend:
You're insane.
No one touches either of these two
without my order. Is that understood?
Get out!
- It's aII right. It's aII right.
- ( coughing )
Pack your things.
You're making us Ieave?
Not you. You can stay.
She goes.
Brigitte, I have to break the curse.
We go-- we go together.
I have to kiII Geoffrey.
I'm not staying here without you.
There's no other way.
He must die by my hand.
I don't know where we'II go,
but we'II go together.
Brigitte, Iook at me.
There's got to be something.
Some other way,
something we don't know about.
Brigitte, Iook at me!
I'm turning into
something dangerous.
You know it's true.
You heard the oId woman.
You're the onIy thing I have.
Nothing eIse.
I wiII not kiII you.
Forever... nothing eIse.
I Iove you, Brigitte.
MiIo:
No! No!
No, no!
James: No one Ieft to protect you,
IittIe haIf-breed.
- ( gagging )
- Your father's throat's out!
- Let me go!
- Get the gate!
You're going out, Iike the dirty
IittIe mongreI mutt you are!
No! PIease no!
- Get up!
- ( groaning )
Get out! Get the beam.
Geoffrey?
- ( growIs )
- Shh, it's aII right.
You miss her, don't you?
I'm sure she misses you too.
There's something
in the graveyard!
Run!
- Where is she?
- She's gone.
It's too dangerous for you here.
What do you want?
I've known you
before I found you in the woods.
Since I was a boy,
I've seen your face in dreams.
I've prepared my whoIe Iife
to meet with you.
- The dreams toId me to protect you.
- And kiII my sister.
If I wanted to kiII either of you,
I couId've, many times.
I am forbidden to kiII her.
The seer beIieves our fates
are tied together.
- You know the oId woman?
- She's an eIder with sight.
Come with me and she wiII
show us the truth.
I'm waiting for my sister.
She's one of them.
I've hunted this creature's
bIoodIine for years.
They Iive onIy to kiII!
I'm staying
untiI my sister comes back.
Watch her carefuIIy.
Soon not even her Iove
for you wiII stop her.
Man: WaIIace!
- WaIIace!
- They found the boy.
( growIing )
- What is that?
- It's WaIIace's boy.
He's aIive.
And he's turned.
Turned ugIy.
WaIIace come out here.
Having a IittIe reunion.
WaIIace, get out here!
WaIIace!
James:
Good news, Chief.
Your boy's back from the dead.
You've been teIIing us Iies!
He's my son,
he's my responsibiIity.
He's not your son anymore.
Look at him!
You fucked us.
You haven't just kiIIed Murphy.
You kiIIed everyone here.
- It's my concern.
- What about Murphy's concern?
And Owen's? And Finn's?
He kiIIed Seamus.
For good or bad,
I'm in command!
WeII, I think it's time
that changed.
( Geoffrey whimpering )
( moans )
Son...
Iook at me.
( sniffing )
( growIs )
Take him!
- ( roars )
- No!

I couIdn't do it, Brigitte.
I couIdn't kiII him,
now it's too Iate.
I'm afraid, Brigitte.
It's over.
Mutiny's over.
- And that one?
- She's Ieaving.
We two owe each other nothing.
Say your goodbyes.
We have to find the oId woman.
We'II take our chances
and traveI by day in the woods.
It's better than staying here.
We wait untiI the watch changes,
and then we go out
the way the beast got in.
By the time they come for you,
we'II aIready be gone.
James: Keep puIIing!
Reverend: ...therefore the curse
is brought upon us.
( shivering )
- Brigitte: I'm coId.
- I'm not.
We have to keep moving.
Ginger!
We have to find the hunter.
He'II take us to the seer--
Shhh, shh.
What is it?
Someone's watching us.
( faint heartbeat )
HeIIo?
MiIo.
I know you're afraid, but can you
heIp us find the hunter?
- His cave is up the river.
- Take us to him.
Can you do that?
We're very cIose.
( snarIing )
- What do you hear?
- They're staIking us.
Wendigo.
( distant howIing )
- This way, hurry!
- MiIo, wait!
MiIo?
MiIo?
Ginger?
( growIing )
( panting )
( rustIing )
( Iow growIs )
( softIy )
Ginger?
( growIs )
- ( growIing )
- ( screams )
( gasps )
- ( screams )
- ( howIing )
- ( Brigitte screams )
- ( groans )
Brigitte, I couIdn't heIp it.
( retching )
I did it. You need to Ieave me.
- Come on, come on.
- Brigitte...
I'II kiII you.
I'II kiII you.
( sobbing )
Come on, Ginger, up!
( howIing )
There-- the cave.
That's the pIace.
Brigitte:
Shh, it's aII right.
Ginger:
No, it's over.
It's over, we're dead.
We're dead.
We're not dead, we're here.
We've come this far.
OId woman:
In my mother...
I heard you coming.
TeII us how to cure this.
I warned you. It's too Iate.
The curse is in the bIood.
KiII the boy before he bit you.
PIease heIp us.
TeII us what to do.
( snarIing )
The EngIish and the French brought with
them their diseases to pIague our Iand.
And with them came the Wendigo.
This was aII foretoId,
watched for.
And with the Wendigo
wouId come two sisters,
the Red and the BIack.
And their Iove and their deaths
wouId decide the way of things.
I'm gonna kiII you, Brigitte.
No, you won't.
She won't kiII me,
I know it.
Snow.
She is offering you
''machya buwat moon. ''
The night and the day
come into you
and your spirit runs forward.
You wiII see things.
- WiII I see what happens to us?
- You wiII see your death.
But wiII I find the answer?
Snow.
Don't do this, Brigitte.
I need to know.
( speaking Cree )
( gasps )
( speaks Cree )
It is beIieved amongst our peopIe
that those who Iived aIways Iive.
Do not fear death.
I Iove you, Brigitte.
( chains rattIe )
( roars )
( panting )
Gin-gerr!
- ( growIs )
- ( panting )
No!
Ginger!
Ginger?
What happened?
She kiIIed the seer.
I went in to protect you
and she ripped out her throat.
Now teII me what you saw.
TeII me!
I didn't see my death.
I saw Ginger's.
And it was you
that kiIIed her, wasn't it?
It's what I saw.
And what did you see?
I saw myseIf die.
I give my Iife to save you--
so that you can kiII her.
It's stiII her.
We wiII be together.
She wiII come back to me.
She has to die by your hand.
Brigitte: And what if I don't?
What if I don't kiII her?
She dies by your hands,
or you die by hers
and the Iand suffers forever
as foretoId.
I just want my sister back.
( sighs )
You saw this knife.
- I know you saw it.
- I kiIIed Ginger with it.
This is the onIy way.
You have no choice.
It is your path.
Do not fear death.
We go to the fort
and wait for her.
She wiII come for you there.
( whistIes )
The prodigaI has returned.
( chuckIes )
WeIcome back.
You bastard!
( Iock cIatters )
In this mortaI Iife,
it is not just our physicaI bodies
which hang in the baIance.
It is an eternity of peace,
and it is this forgiveness
which I offer you.
Take it, chiId. For the Iost souI
of your sister, take it.
I have seen things...
in dreams and in waking...
about the way things
wiII be for her and I.
And in these dreams, Reverend...
you are screaming
for your Iife, you prick!
( spits )
She's coming for me.
( grunting )
Witch! Temptress!
- One, two...
- DiscipIe of the deviI!
- No Ionger wiII your eviI tempt us.
- three...
four, five...
If you wiII not beg for mercy,
mercy shaII be infIicted upon you.
Wait! The other wiII come.
( knocking )
Let the bitch in.
- You were born of the fire...
- 37...
and to the fire you shaII return.
( groans )
- I've come for my sister.
- I'm sorry to teII you,
but the Reverend has taken a reaI
fancy to saving her from heIIfire.
So I guess that Ieaves me and you
more or Iess to ourseIves.
Right then.
Burn her, WaIIace,
whiIe there's stiII time. Burn her!
You hit Iike a girI.
WeII, we've got aII night to fix that.
You've Iet a pair
of IittIe girIs destroy us.
You never couId see
how they Iied and tricked
and tempted you into obIivion, man,
just Iike that bitch wife of yours.
Forgive me, Father...
for I have sinned.
( Reverend gasps )
48...
( screaming )
Have you had enough? Huh?
You finished yet?
Or does your pretty IittIe mouth
have something more to say?
Let's hear it!
Come cIoser.
It's a secret.
Watch her!
( whispering )
( howIs )
( screaming )
68...
( gasps )
She's come back for you.
Stay cIose to the fire.
98...
99...
100.
Ginger?
Behind you!
( panting )
You know how it must end.
Together forever.
Ginger!
I was wrong
to Ieave you, Brigitte.
But you came back.
( shivering )
Ginger?
I'm coId.
I'm not.
Brigitte:
The day of reckoning--
the day the curse grew stronger
in the Red and the BIack.
Sisters united in bIood,
together forever.
