Rýza Abi, do something! Dance!
Don't just stand there. Dance!
How am I supposed to dance
wearing a ton of stufflike this?
What shall we do? Run?
- Sure, let's run. This way.
Come over here.
For God's sake, Abi!
You're standing there staring
at the crowd! What's the deal?
But these slippers weigh a ton...
Rýza Abi, please!
Move around a bit. Dance. OK?
Dance a bit. Jump up and down.
Cheer them on over there, look.
- What?
- Cheer on the crowd over there.
You're useless, Rýza Abi.
Pathetic.
Watch the lights.
You stand there like a lump.
But you see, Çetin said to dance.
- OK, so dance then, Abi.
I can't dance normally.
How am I supposed to
inside a slipper like this?
If we'd been shown what to do,
if we'd had some training, maybe...
Training? OK. Remind me, Çetin.
We'll sign Rýza Abi up for school.
What school?
- Slipper college...
Or talent high school.
First high school, then college.
Don't give me that, Rýza Abi.
Or I'll get you under my feet.
What?
Well, you're a slipper, right?
Çetin, a slipper under my foot!
Nice one, Çetin. The guy ribs me
and you laugh. Great!
If the boss cracks a joke, you laugh.
Well, you kind of have to.
How many bosses crack jokes at
their staff? Especially these days...
Look, don't tell anyone. I mean it.
I'm not coming again in any case.
Rýza Abi, anyone hearing you
would think I'd corrupted you.
We got to work.
Look what the guy says to me.
And you just laugh.
So he's the boss.
You have to laugh at the boss?
Have you given up cheffing?
It's a loser.
I'm out of the restaurant thing.
Let someone else do the cooking.
I'll do the eating.
Call yourself a brother, Ahmet Efendi?
Look at the guy, Hadji! He throws
his own brother out on the street.
- What's going on, Lokman?
- I'm no brother of yours!
I have no family
in this neighbourhood! It's over!
Here's your dirty underpants too,
Lokman Efendi!
Hey, what are you doing, Yenge?
Knock on this door again
and I'll break your legs!
You shouldn't play with
a young person's heart, Ahmet Efendi!
Move it, come on.
What happened?
I've fallen in love.
The guy just doesn't get it.
I promised my baby I'd marry her.
What can I do now, Rýza?
Kill myself?
Lokman?
What's happened?
I don't know. There was a big fight.
Ahmet Abi kicked him out of the house.
Calls himself a brother, huh?
Is that what a brother is?
Look, he's your big brother.
Don't make such a deal ofit.
He whacked me three times.
Look, it's bleeding.
Go wash yourself, Lokman.
So what's behind all this?
I don't know. He said something about
being in love, but I didn't get it.
So he'll be staying here then.
He's my brother.
Where else can he stay?
Well, that's what I'm saying.
Oh God! Come here, Lokman.
Let me take a look at you.
- Ayla, can I turn this off?
- I am watching it, Rýza!
- Rýza Þenyurt?
- Yes?
Sign here.
Thanks.
Duran Abi. What's this?
How about talking to a person first?
How about telling that person
to pay you what they owe first?
So it's straight to court, is it?
Would you have been able to pay?
How can I?
Didn't we go under together?
Wasn't it you
who got us into the Jolly Life?
What's wrong with turning to the law?
If you're right, it'll be done with.
Well if you win, what will you want
from me, Duran Hodja?
Whatever we paid out.
Really?
All right then.
See you in court, Duran Hodja.
For goodness sake.
Open your mouth.
- What's that?
Honey.
Where's that come from?
Nursel Abla sent it.
It's really good for you.
- It's worked wonders forthem.
- Nursel Abla sent it, did she?
Ayla, do you go telling everyone
about our private life?
This is Nursel Abla. In two questions
she knows everything. She's a wizard.
Like what kind of questions?
You know, when was the last time,
who was the best? And then she knows.
She asks who was the best?
Shame on her!
I'm not having any.
I need my sleep. I'm not in the mood.
She says everyone goes through this,
that we shouldn't give up, Rýza.
And she shouldn't stick her nose
in other people's affairs.
- Lokman!
- What's up, Rýza Abi?
- Turn out the light.
OK, OK.
You turn it out too, Ayla.
She asks who was the best, huh?
Shame on her!
Here. Lawyer Hüsnü...
He's a really good lawyer.
Oh, Çetin. What is it?
No, no. I'm not doing
ridiculous stufflike that.
A month?
No problem. I'll see.
I'll call you.
I'm not calling. I'll see.
OK, thanks. Goodbye.
How are you doing?
- Hey, Çeto! How are you doing?
- Thanks. Got any phone units?
- Sure. I'll fix you 25.
- Take it easy there. Where's Nihat?
How are you doing, Çetin? Welcome.
- Take it easy.
What's up? How are you doing?
The world's most painful slipper!
Is everyone here?
Great.
Pick yourselves the right size.
What's this?
A month's work. Through to new year.
You've landed on your feet, assholes!
High five...
Pick one, Rýza Abi. Go on.
- What, one of these?
- Yes. It fits you perfectly. Great.
Put it on, Abi. Go on!
The other day, one of our guys
rightly raised the issue of training.
We should deal with
the issue right away. Why?
Because it's all about acting now.
I want you playing characters now.
- Who are you?
- Santa Claus.
Santa Claus.
How does Santa laugh? Çetin?
Ho-ho-ho!
Nice one, Çetin. You're awesome.
He laughs like this: Ho-ho-ho!
Let's hear you then.
Ho-ho-ho!
Nice. Now make it sound happier,
friendlier. Like this: Ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho-ho!
Good. Again. Louder this time.
Ho-ho-ho!
Wait a second, wait.
Rýza Abi, let's hear you.
Ho-ho-ho...
What the hell was that?
Ho-ho.
Rýza Abi, please!
Concentrate a bit.
We're here to make kids happy,
not scare them. Listen. Hoh-hoh-hoh!
Ho-ho-ho!
- Çetin, give Rýza Abi lessons.
- OK, Abi.
I want the better guys among you
to teach the not-so-good ones.
In-house training.
There you go!
No chance! The guy has it in for me.
The guy's right, Abi.
Let's practise. Ho-ho-ho!
That's what I'm doing. Ho-ho-ho.
No, Abi. Sound friendlier.
- But this gets in my mouth, Çetin.
Smile a bit, Rýza Abi.
Ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho-ho!
More like from inside, Abi.
Make your voice deeper.
That's what I'm doing.
How do you mean "from inside"?
What have you got me into, Çetin?
I told you I wasn't doing
anything ridiculous.
Ho-ho-ho. There, I'm doing it.
How else am I supposed to do it?
Ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho-ho, like that?
Am I supposed to frown?
Abi, what's with frowning?
You want to beat the kids too?
God! Come on, smile, Abi!
You're Santa Claus.
OK. Here, ho-ho.
Ho-ho. You know why I'm laughing?
Well, normally you'd go "ho-ho-ho"
to the animals back in the village.
You'd go "ho-ho" to keep them
away from the river and stuff.
How am I supposed to go "ho-ho"?
Ho-ho, what the hell is that?
- They're paying 40 lira a day.
Here you go, ho-ho.
- Ho-ho-ho...
Don't laugh, Abi.
How can I not laugh?
People are looking.
Ho-ho-ho...
Oh God, Çetin!
Ayla, how about fixing
your brother some eggs?
- But you just had pilau, Lokman!
- My mind was on eggs.
Rýza, it's time we went to see
the girl I plan to marry.
Talk Ahmet into asking for her hand
and let's be done with it.
We'll see, Lokman.
Just eat your eggs and we'll see.
Ayla, my eggs?
OK, OK...
Make sure the whites are wobbly.
You know, kind of like jelly.
- Rýza, you want some too?
- No.
Selam aleykum!
Aleykum selam.
- How are you, Çetin?
- Good, Abi.
Santas!
Come over here.
OK, see you.
Good luck then.
- Don't forget. Hoh-hoh-hoh.
- OK, don't worry.
- Emrah. Come round this way.
Turn around.
Rýza Abi, grab Emrah.
Emrah, hold on
to whatever you can.
Emrah... Turgut...
- Thanks, Abi.
- Nazmi... Rýza Abi...
- What's this?
- The name of the shop you're going to.
The ball's in your court.
The job is down to you now.
Don't forget, we're a team.
What are we, Turgut?
- We're a team, Abi.
- We're a team.
If everyone plays well,
the team wins.
You're in charge
of the costumes now.
Don't smoke while you're in them
and be careful when you eat.
Don't use mobile phones
while you're on the job.
Emrah, don't talk to yourself
while you're on the job!
Hello? Yes?
Honey, how many times do I have to
tell you not to call me on Emrah!
So that's the deal, guys. You smile,
you're energetic, you're dynamic. OK?
Good luck to you then, guys.
I'm going this way too.
See you later Nazmi.
Toyzzz... Hah! This is me.
This is my place. See you later.
Take it easy, Rýza Abi. Good luck.
- Good luck.
- Go easy there, Rýza Abi. Take care.
- Here we go then. You take care too.
Selam aleykum.
Where have you been?
You're an hour late.
Well, the agency brought us here
all together, by minibus.
Come with me. Come on.
He's not late! It's a whole month
to go till new year. The guy's early.
- Get on with your work, Pelin.
- OK.
The hours are 9 am to 8 pm.
There's an hour off for lunch.
Nilüfer has the lunch vouchers.
You can get them from the till.
This is where you change.
OK. I'm actually wearing
my normal clothes underneath.
- So I'll leave the stuffhere.
- Where are your eyebrows, Abi?
- What?
- You're supposed to have eyebrows.
Eyebrows?
Well, they didn't give us any.
Get moving, Abi. Move it.
What was your name?
- Rýza Þenyurt.
- Come here, Rýza Abi.
You stand here.
Go on, start, Abi.
OK. They showed us
what to do anyway.
Go on, start, Abi. Go on.
Ho-ho-ho!
Happy new year, everyone!
Have a prosperous new year!
All the best to you!
Ho-ho-ho!
Just stick to the "ho-ho", friend.
Don't do any more.
- But that's the hardest part for me.
- Which part?
Ho-ho. If you're asking why,
back in the village, it's what we...
What village? Get on with it.
Come on! Ho-ho! Let's hear it.
What kind of agency is that,
sending us Santas from the village?
Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho, little boy!
Ho-ho!
Aren't you washing cars any more?
That's over. I'm sick of that place.
I'm not working with that guy.
Look, I'm the boss's brother
and I'm still stuck washing cars.
- I'm going to set up my own business.
- What business is that?
I'll look into it.
That brother of ours is shady.
And that's a fact.
He makes excuses to his own brother,
to me to keep my nose out of expenses.
And he calls himself a brother!
What are you doing with that?
Give it right here.
It's medicine, you animal. Medicine!
You'll be eating us one day.
Where's the lid for it?
On the table.
You're something else!
Welcome, Rýza.
Thanks.
- He's got worms.
- What are you up to, Lokman?
What are you muttering about?
He was eating our honey,
the animal!
Our honey?
Where have you been?
Out working. I've started work.
Work?
Why didn't you say?
It's temporary. Until new year.
Çetin fixed it for me.
What kind of job is it?
In a shopping mall.
There's a toy shop in Ýstinye Park.
I stand there at the door.
- At the door?
- I welcome people, you know.
Great.
It seems like a jolly life.
I'm going to wash my hands.
My real profession
is working as a chef.
But I sold my wife's gold, everything
we had and got the money together...
...to open my own place.
I'd always worked for someone else
ever since starting as a busboy.
I thought I'd open my own place.
And that's what I did.
As soon as I'd opened
people were talking about the crisis.
So you see, forget the crisis,
I couldn't even take talk ofit.
I went to the restaurant one day.
Around noon,
hung overfrom the night before.
The place was empty.
The staff were gone
after not getting paid.
I cooked a few dishes on my own.
Still there were no customers.
I picked up that chair
and slammed it on the cash register.
Then I left.
And gave up on being a chef.
From that day to this
I've never picked up a knife again.
I started hanging round the teahouse.
What else can you do?
Meanwhile, I was gambling a bit.
Teahouse gambling, but still gambling.
I mean, just a bit.
The guy has all the luck.
Look, there hasn't been
a false joker all game.
Whoa, Zafer Abi!
You grabbed the good ones again.
- Keep your nose out, Köksal Abi.
- There's always next time, Rýza!
Dear friends, give me
five minutes of your time...
...and your life
could be a whole lot jollier.
I'm not a salesman.
I'm not trying to sell you anything.
I'm here to offer a partnership.
Abi, you...
- What's your name?
- Zafer.
- Do you want a jollier life?
- Sure.
- You?
- Who wouldn't?
How long have you been playing Okey?
- Since I was a kid.
- How many hours?
- Oh, a couple ofhours.
Two hours is such a long time,
isn't it? A person's life could change.
You make a decision and find
your life's become a lot jollier.
You won't get a jollier life
by playing Okey in the teahouse.
But you will get it
by stirring yourself and working.
Rýza, welcome.
- Thanks. How are you?
- Fine. Come in.
This way.
Relax.
Birgül Haným.
Excuse me. Rýza bey.
How are you? I'm Rýza Þenyurt.
My name is Selim Akçay.
My real profession is as a painter.
I went bankrupt a short time ago.
I was left with nothing at all.
Everything was terrible
until I discovered Jolly Life.
It's been two years since I came
to the Jolly Life meeting.
And now I live in this house.
Me and my family both use
and sell Jolly Life products.
And we have a jolly life!
Life is beautiful
if it's jolly enough.
Louder!
Life is beautiful
if it's jolly enough.
It seems to me like a good deal, Ayla.
You just need to find a load of staff.
The more everyone earns,
the more they make.
It's a great system they invented.
You laugh sometimes, you know.
You laugh to yourself.
This pock-face got up
and said he'd been out of work.
He said he got into Jolly Life
a couple of years back.
Then he showed a photo of the villa
he lives in now. The man, his dog...
He's not the type
to have a dog normally.
But when he got the villa
he got the dog too.
Rýza, you were just like this
when you opened the restaurant too.
Where does that come into it now?
Look, give me the gold that's left
and if I don't double it in two years...
...you can call me a loser.
I need it right away today.
I'm buying stuff tomorrow, you see.
Shall I get it?
As you like.
You're a darling.
A real darling, you know?
You'll see. In two years.
Check your watch. In two years.
Oh, sweet rose,
My hand is broken,
My heart is at odds...
Hello?
Hello, it's Birgül Ýnce.
From Jolly Life. Rýza Bey?
Yes, hello?
How can I help, Birgül Hanim?
Are you ready?
I'm ready!
But hey, how about asking
what you're ready for, huh?
You'll both be a salesman yourself
and find staff to sell on your behalf.
You'll be a salesman and team leader.
You'll be boss and worker both at once.
No one is tied to anyone,
but everyone is tied to everyone else.
Let's say the day comes when your
staff numbers reach 30, 40, 50, 100.
Then you're just the boss, Rýza Bey.
When? In two years!
Maybe sooner if you work well.
Show what you're made of,
believe in your potential...
...and see your dreams
come true, Rýza Þenyurt.
You deserve
a far jollier life, Rýza Bey.
Far jollier.
Just sign on the dotted line.
Here we go then.
In the name of God.
Everyone gives you
half their earnings, right?
Right and I give half my earnings
to the guy above me.
And the guy above me gives half
his earnings to the guy above him.
The guy below me gives me half his
earnings and keeps half for himself.
I keep half of the half
I get from him for myself...
...and give half to the guy above me.
It goes on like that.
I tell you, it's all
a bit confusing to me.
It's not confusing, Duran Abi.
The first payment comes from you.
You buy stuff from the firm, the bag.
From then on its fifty-fifty.
The products are great.
It's healthy, organic stuff.
Look, go for it, Duran Abi,
while you have the chance.
Or later you'll only regret
not being as jolly as everyone else!
Look, I don't want you suffering.
I'm just telling you. It's up to you.
OK, where do we find sales staff, Abi?
Well, I found them in the teahouse.
You'll find them somewhere.
Get it into your heads.
Everyone can do this job.
Just believe in your potential,
believe in yourself.
Don't waste your lives
playing Okey.
Jolly Life has a list.
You sell from that list.
You keep half for yourself
and give half to who?
- The guy above you.
- You give it to the guy above you.
The guy below you does some sales.
Gives half of it to the guy above him.
Who's the guy above him?
You.
Who's the guy above you?
Me.
Half of 5 lira is 2.5.
Who do I give the 2.5 lira to?
- To the guy above you.
- Who does he give 1.25 to?
- The guy above him.
- And so it goes on.
In just two years
the guy bought that villa.
I saw the picture he had.
I couldn't believe my eyes.
In a nutshell, Aytekin and Gültekin,
Duran Hodja...
...plus Yadigar, an ex-carthief,
became my first salesmen.
Hello there. Good day to you.
Can I take two minutes of yourtime?
I'm promoting a new product.
A beauty product.
Skincare, hand cream.
- No one buys the stuff.
- We're getting late.
Remind people who you are.
Take orders.
Good luck then.
Where are you talking about?
The Ministry ofHealth
has banned the sale and import...
...of certain substances
widely used in cosmetic products.
Floroban tops the list
of banned substances cited...
...in a statement from
the General Directorate of Pharmacy.
It is warned that the said substance
could have carcinogenic effects.
People with allergies, pregnant women,
and those at risk from hypertension...
...are warned against the substance.
All products containing Floroban
will be recalled from the market.
So Rýza Abi,
what's this merry life about?
Jolly life.
Well, jolly life then.
What's it about?
Poison, Lokman.
Come on, Ayla.
What are you mad about?
I asked my brother-in-law something.
I was going to tell him.
There's no money in that business.
It was a fantastic product.
How come I didn't see it?
I went underthe same time
as the stuff was banned.
Let's look into it then.
But, Mr Lawyer. I also want to ask
about the fee thing. How much is it?
- We have a scale of charges.
- Really?
- Look at trial court cases.
- What?
Turn to trial court cases.
Can you see trial court cases there?
It says 4400 lira.
But that's a lot.
I don't have that much.
It doesn't matter. I don't either.
No one's paid me what it says there
on a single case yet.
Pay half, that'll do.
I'll do it for Sýrrý.
Thank you.
Half then.
- Yes?
- Yusuf Lokman Bal. Is he here?
He's in the bathroom right now.
Why are you asking?
We're friends of his.
Lokman! Your friends are here.
What friends, Ayla?
How do I know? Have a look.
Hello.
Come here, rapist!
What are you doing?
Hohoho!
What's going on here?
Ahmet, they're beating up Lokman!
Come here for God's sake.
- Hey, what's going on?
- This guy raped our sister.
He raped our sister.
What? Really? You raped her?
- Would I do that, Ahmet?
- Son of a bitch! Bastard!
Ahmet, don't!
Is that why I brought you
here from the village?
So you could go about raping women?
Press down with this.
Did you really rape the girl,
Lokman?
Rýza Abi, rape is
such a horrible word.
Don't lie or I'll beat you too.
Tell your brother-in-law.
The other day, you know
that derelict house up the top?
I was sitting there with Þermin
and, sorry, but she kissed my ear.
She kissed your ear?
Aha. When she kissed my ear
I felt all tingly inside.
So I thought I'd just
pull up her skirt.
Lokman! What were you doing
pulling up the girl's skirt?
But she kissed my ear, Ayla.
So at the end of the day, you...
I'm afraid so.
Now we've had it!
Well, so he raped her.
Who were those guys then?
Her older brother
and her other older brother.
He ate half the honey that day,
the animal.
So the honey works.
Yes, sure. Right. It works wonders.
No, when I say it works...
Sweetie, don't tell me
you're all hung up about honey now.
Have you lost your mind?
I haven't lost my mind, Rýza.
I want children.
And honey's going to do that
for you, is it?
Well, maybe. Rýza, suppose
we go and see another doctor?
I'm not seeing any more doctors.
Keep me out of this.
Ho-ho-ho! Happy new year!
Happy new year to you all!
Happy new year! Happy new year!
Goodbye.
- Hat do you want, Lokman?
- Rýza, where are you?
At work.
Rýza, we're at Ýstinye Park.
Where's the toy shop?
I'm not at the store right now.
They sent me off somewhere.
Go over by the restaurants.
Where, Rýza?
You little shit, Lokman!
Just go to the restaurants.
I'll find you there. OK.
Serkan Bey,
I've got a visitor coming.
Can I go for lunch
half an hour early?
No.
Ho-ho-ho! Happy new year!
Oh, God.
Hey, baby! The toyshop's here.
Look, you see Santa Claus?
Look at Santa!
You won't even smile at Santa, baby!
Look, it's OK. I'll handle it.
Let me treat you to something, baby.
Selam aleykum!
Aleykum selam. Where were you?
You didn't answerthe phone either.
We have to take toys
outside the mall sometimes.
I have a job to do here.
- What are you doing here.
- I'll introduce you. Þermin.
Right. Welcome, Þermin.
Thanks, Abi.
Show him.
Rýza Abi,
it's Lokman's idea but...
Show him, Þermin. Rýza is a gem.
Don't be embarrassed. Show him.
What's she going to show me?
Here, Rýza. Open it up.
What is it?
A pregnancy thing.
What?
Two lines means
you're pregnant, Rýza Abi.
So?
Look. There's two lines.
Lokman, please don't tell him.
Don't cry, baby.
It's all part of the plan.
If we don't do something now
it'll be way too late.
What plan is that, huh?
Rýza Abi, they won't let us
get married any other way.
I thought about eloping
but that's a no-no.
It's crucial we have a wedding
and get some money together, right?
So when did you get to do this?
You only raped her the other day.
Oh, sorry.
We've been doing it for ages.
You've been doing it for ages?
Sure. We've had this thing
for a month and a half.
Whoa! A month and a half?
Rýza Abi, I did it
so they'd have to let me marry her.
They'll kill me, if you don't help.
They'll either let me marry her
or kill me. It's reached that point.
Take that away. Filthy thing.
What's it doing on the table?
Hey girl, was his the only ear
you found to kiss in all of Istanbul?
Ear? What ear, Abi?
- You kissed his ear.
- No, I didn't, Abi.
You did, baby.
What do you mean you didn't?
OK, cut it out.
It's OK, I get the picture.
Lokman, when did you
turn into such a maniac?
Look, her mum cornered her.
She realized we were doing it.
That's why the guys beat me up.
If Þermin hadn't got scared
everything would have been fine.
- What are we going to do, Rýza?
- How do I know?
- Selam aleykum.
- Aleykum selam.
Is Ahmet Abi at home?
Yes. Come in. Come in, Ayla.
Shut the door, Rýza.
OK.
- How are you, children?
- Fine, thanks.
- I've finished your skirt, Yenge.
- Oh, thanks, Ayla dear.
But I don't know
if it's that fantastic.
It is, it is. Look,
these elephants are lovely.
- They're rabbits, Yenge.
- Here we go then.
- How much do I owe you, Ayla?
- Selam aleykum, Ahmet Abi.
You must be joking.
My brother.
He looks well. Mashallah!
- Mashallah!
You weren't at Friday prayers again.
Ahmet, if it's OK with you,
we want to discuss something.
The business of Yusuf Lokman.
What about it, Ayla Haným?
It was your idea to bring
that son of a bitch to Istanbul.
I wish I hadn't gone along with it.
Rýza, it's better
if you explain the rest.
Ahmet Abi, as you know,
Lokman is an ignorant boy.
But what can you do?
He's a brother of ours.
He's been seeing a girl.
I guess he told you too.
They came to see me the other day.
Rýza, they said, it's like this.
I mean, in a word,
he's got the girl pregnant.
Get out, Ayla Haným!
I have no family
in this neighbourhood! It's over!
Don't ever come here again
for that son of a bitch.
Enough! That's it!
For God's sake.
For the love of God!
You don't have to push us around.
You'd expect one real man
in the family, damn it!
I wish I'd charged her
for that skirt.
It took me nine days. You heard, huh?
She called those big rabbits elephants.
What happened?
"Forget this neighbourhood," he said.
"My brother deserves
a wedding at the Hilton."
- He said he'd pay for everything.
- He congratulated you too.
"He didn't just rape the girl,
he got her pregnant too," he said.
He's proud of you.
He beat his chest like this.
Was it really bad
what he did?
The guy shoved us out!
We're finished too,
thanks to you.
I won't be surprised
ifhe asks for rent tomorrow.
Why didn't you go
to Friday prayers, Rýza?
What's that got to do with it?
That's why he has this thing
against us. Because you don't go.
So it wasn't because of the honey.
What?
Well, they've been doing it
the whole time.
So?
That means there's no telling
if it works or not.
Good night, Ayla.
Turn out the light.
Ayla?
If we had a child one day...
...look at the uncles he'd have.
Mashallah, huh?
I thought you were going to sleep...
- Lokman!
- What's up, Rýza Abi?
Why haven't you
turned out that light?
OK, OK.
He always leaves it on.
He's a decent guy, I tell you.
I said I had no money.
- He said, "No problem. Neither do I."
- You mean he's not charging you?
No. But he only wants half.
- How much is half?
- A lot.
If you have nothing,
the full amount is a lot, so is half.
So you see,
I'm working for the lawyer.
But the pasta's good, huh?
Thanks.
Enjoy it, Abi.
- Next time I'll treat you.
- You don't have to.
Ahmet, add this to the bill too.
OK, Rýza Abi.
- Take care.
- Goodbye.
Well, enjoy that, Rýza.
Thanks, Abi.
- Did you put water in this?
- Yes, to stop it going dry.
Look, how many times
do I have to tell you?
It doesn't need water.
It cooks in its own juices.
Cook it yourself then, Mr Chef.
For goodness sake!
Rýza Abi, I didn't leave
the house once today.
Bravo! Help your sister then
seeing you've become a housewife.
Make jewellery.
You eat four eggs in one go.
Cut the jokes, Rýza Abi.
We need to ask forthe girl's hand
orthose guys will do me in.
We'd get used to you not being around.
What kind of talk is that?
OK, Lokman. OK.
We'll say we want our rapist boy
to marry your girl and it'll be done.
You're the only elders I have left.
Can't you understand that for once?
OK, Lokman.
Eat your dinner.
Eat a lot and stick it on credit.
Ayla, it's really good.
Enjoy it, sweetie.
You want some more pilau?
But stop to breathe now and again.
Or you'll suffocate, God forbid.
There are plenty of companies
doing this business by the book.
So you mean I landed
a dud one of those too?
Look, you sold people things
but you have nothing to show it.
What does that mean?
You collected money from people.
Well, you can't do that.
What are we going to do then?
People are pressing charges.
If they don't with draw those charges
we may not be able to resolve it.
We can't resolve it?
But don't worry. I'm a lawyer.
If I can't do that, I'll spin it out.
What does that mean, if he can't
resolve it, he'll spin it out?
I don't know. He did say
don't worry about it though.
But I like the guy. He's decent.
I reckon he'll sort this thing out.
But he said he couldn't.
He didn't say that. He said
it was tough, it would drag on...
Come on, aren't we going inside?
No. I'm not going near those guys.
Look, we're soaked to the skin.
Go on, get in there.
Enjoy your tea.
Welcome. Thanks.
I've just been
to my lawyer, Duran Abi.
We do that sometimes too.
Really? So you going, me going,
does that make you happy?
When you sued the company,
we automatically sued you, Rýza Abi.
When did you learn to sue, Aytekin?
Hasn't it dawned on you
it might not be my fault?
Wasn't it you who kept
talking up Jolly Life to us?
The guy talked it up to me too.
For God's sake, I'm to blame now!
It was him who talked about two years.
He showed off the villa.
He said this, he said that.
And I shouldn't say this but...
...I sold my wife's gold
to get into this business.
Sýrrý, is this man always
going to bang on like this?
"This man"? Is that what
things have come to, Duran Abi?
Why are you doing this with me?
Sýrrý, put it on my tab.
Duran Hodja, it's still early.
Duran Abi! For goodness sake come back
and let's talk like human beings.
Aytekin, Gültekin, bring him back!
Just look at them!
Look at Aytekin and Gültekin.
Rýza.
Cheers, Sýrrý Abi.
I haven't found my place, you know.
They just don't leave me alone.
There isn't one person I can trust
in this neighbourhood apart from you.
At the first opportunity
they stab you in the back.
Who? Not strangers.
Your friends, your neighbours.
And now the girl's gold has gone too.
Gone to waste. Why?
It's the payoff for always
starting out with the wrong people.
You've drunk enough, Rýza.
Come on now, we're closing.
Look at Duran Abi.
Look at that kid Aytekin.
He's suing me, can you believe it!
The guy talked about a jolly life.
He talked about villas.
"Do you want a villa?" he said.
Do you say no to someone
who asks if you want a villa?
How could you?
Then the government
goes and bans the stuff.
Well, what am I supposed to do now?
Sýrrý Abi,
what am I supposed to do now?
Go home.
Shall I sing you a song, huh?
Shall I sing you a real song?
Huh, Köksal Abi?
Go on.
We graze the goats
by the towering mountain...
Don't cry, my love,
this is your destiny...
If you have no one
but your mother and father...
Only uncaring, disloyal people
Isn't that enough...
Have you been drinking?
Why have you started again, Rýza?
"Why have you started again, Rýza?"
Everything gets solved
when you drink, doesn't it?
You drink when it doesn't.
Just look at Aytekin!
He's suing me.
When did you learn to sue?
Scumbag!
Damn it!
Why didn't you wake me up?
I'm not talking to you. How can I
wake up someone I'm not talking to?
Besides, I did wake you up,
but you went back to sleep again.
Hello. Look, I overslept.
Is Serkan Bey here yet?
No, Rýza Abi. Hurry.
Take it easy, you too.
Ho-ho-ho! Happy new year!
Happy new year, everyone!
- Take it easy there.
- Thanks, Serkan Bey.
Happy new year! Ho-ho-ho!
Overthere, kids. Let me
take a photo of you and Santa.
Here we go then.
Hey, what are you doing?
What do you want with my beard?
You little scumbags!
What way is that to speak, mister?
Look, I'm sorry.
I'll go ho-ho-ho and make it better.
Let's make peace, huh?
You stink of alcohol!
Excuse me, who's in charge here?
I am. How can I help?
What's that disgrace
at the door, mister?
The man stinks of alcohol.
He also swore at my child.
I mean, what more?
Why are you laughing?
It's the first time in my life
I've seen a drunk Santa. Sorry...
I hadn't touched it
for three years, you know?
I'd given it up. You see,
it makes me a bad person.
There, I swore at the kid.
It's true.
Is that any way
for Santa to behave?
But when he tugged off my beard
just like that...
The hooligan...
Goodbye.
Give me your blessing.
- Sure, you have it.
- Goodbye, Rýza Abi.
Goodbye, Abi.
You were fired, Abi! What money?
Nuri Abi would never pay you.
You broke the rules of discipline.
You've damaged the company name,
Rýza Abi.
Be grateful
we aren't suing you.
But I worked all those days.
Won't I get paid forthem?
That money's gone. Forget it.
You won't get it.
But I spent
all those hours on my feet.
Then you drank on yourfeet too.
Like at a cocktail party!
For God's sake, Rýza Abi.
Santa doesn't get drunk!
Now I have to send a replacement.
That means a ton of work.
Rýza Abi, go and talk, say sorry.
Get them to take you back.
Nihat! Come over here.
Coming, Abi.
So you reckon
I should say sorry, huh?
Well, it would be too bad
to lose that money.
Thanks, Tayfun.
It's me, Necati, Abi.
Sorry, Necati.
He's back, Ayla.
- Where have you been? We'll be late.
- What's going on?
We're going to see the bride.
Put on something smart.
- OK.
- What's that bag?
The toyshop's thing.
Hurry. We'll be waiting right here.
- OK, OK.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
Well, where has
the last year gone?
I've opened the subject.
The rest is foryou...
- What subject?
- You know, the subject.
I think you know the punishment
for what this boy has done.
But I'm not someone
with old-fashioned views.
Up to now I've worked
for at least 40 companies.
And not once have I complained.
Maþallah!
Business is slack now. But any builder
asks to see me first.
"Where's Ali Usta?"
The important thing is
that they love one another.
In their ignorant way, of course.
But what's done is done.
Let's get them married properly
and be done with it.
You have no choice. This business
will work out either this way or that.
What do you have to say, mister?
Well, what can I say?
Exactly like you said.
Be grateful for
my father's modern views.
Otherwise we'd have killed that boy.
Thank you.
Seeing things are as they are,
you're to cover all the costs.
We don't have the means.
OK, no problem.
That doesn't matter.
You're to have a terrific wedding.
But we won't be coming to it.
You won't be coming?
Why on earth not?
Custom has been broken. We won't come.
We won't get involved.
So long as the kids are happy...
Thank God.
This business has been sorted.
"That doesn't matter."
Well, what does matter, Ayla?
So they should kill my brother, Rýza?
Then everyone stands to gain.
What kind of talk is that, Rýza Abi?
You're saying let them kill me?
Yes, exactly.
It doesn't matter for goodness sake.
Aytekin, I say you should
take back your charges.
And then everyone else
will do the same in turn.
How can I take back
my charges all on my own, Abi?
Look, don't you know
it's not my fault?
But they say, "How could he
not know what was in the stuff?"
For goodness sake!
How would I know?
But they say
you had training, Abi.
The training you're talking about
was two days. That's all.
It's the lawyer.
I'll tell him right off.
Aytekin's pulling out,
so automatically Gültekin is too.
Drop it, Abi.
OK, just hold on.
Hello? Hüsnü Bey, hello.
Well, I'm with Aytekin right now.
Hopefully we've made a deal.
I see. Right, then I'II...
OK. All right.
He says the trial's on Friday.
Talk round everyone by then, he says.
- I know, Abi.
- Know what?
- That the trial's on Friday.
- So what do you say?
Good luck with it, Abi.
Are you taking back the charges or not?
- No, I'm not, Abi.
- You're not.
- No.
OK then.
Shame on you!
- What's that bag?
- None of your business!
If you press here,
it sings and dances.
Selam aleykum.
Serkan Bey,
I went to the agency.
They said I'd broken
the rules of discipline.
They said I wouldn't get paid
for the days I'd worked.
I thought, well, I was
on my feet all those hours.
A guy there said
if I came and said sorry...
...and if they agreed to it
there'd be a chance of coming back.
Sorry, but we've ordered
another Santa to replace you.
Well you see,
they've sent me back.
Look, I'm really not
kind of person to swear.
I can't believe
it just came out with that boy.
Mum, look! Santa's sack!
Yes, little honey. Santa's sack!
Thanks, you too.
Ho-ho-ho!
- You got a deal, Rýza Abi?
- Yes. Here, don't you see?
There you go! You think
they'd find anyone better, Abi?
Unbelievable! They fire Santa
at new year. For goodness sake!
Ho-ho-ho! Happy new year!
Happy new year!
I want my present this year.
You never come to our neighbourhood.
Inshallah! Inshallah!
Excuse me, lady.
Could we speak to Rýza Þenyurt?
Ho-ho-ho!
He isn't here right now.
Find somewhere to sit and wait.
- He'll be back soon.
- OK. Thank you.
Santa, what's your number?
Look, don't drag it out.
Here, it's me. OK.
Who are you?
Rýza. It's me, Rýza.
Rýza Abi, my God! Is it you?
OK. It's me. Cut it out.
Get going, go on.
God! I'd never have thought
this could happen!
- What are you doing here?
- I'm working. What else?
- Now drop it and get going.
- Let me take a photo of you.
Why are you here again?
Rýza Abi, seriously
what are you doing here?
Doing shit, Lokman!
I'm doing shit!
Get out ofhere! I'm working.
Get lost!
Is there a problem?
No, these guys
mistook me for someone else.
They mistook you for someone else?
I'm curious now. Who?
Come on, Lokman. Let's go.
- OK, Rýza Abi. See you back home.
- Go on, move.
- See you back home?
- Well, he's my brother-in-law.
Rýza Abi, look please.
Be a bit more careful.
Look, it's seven, Þermin. I know.
- No, it's nine.
Selam aleykum.
Aleykum selam.
Wait, let's ask him.
Rýza, how many reindeer
does Santa have?
Lokman, the guy gave me hell
all thanks to you.
I'm not in the mood forthis.
Why are you here again?
Rýza, the guys aren't messing around.
They'll kill me as soon as
Þermin's belly starts showing.
- So what am I supposed to do?
- Help! Stop them killing me.
Look, you know my situation.
What can I do?
Besides, is a wedding compulsory?
Elope and be done with it.
Of course it's compulsory.
They'll pin gold on us at the wedding
and that'll help set us up.
Otherwise how are we all
going to fit in your house?
Why would you be living with us?
The wedding hall wants money upfront.
Otherwise the rest is easy.
So you want money from me, do you?
No, Rýza Abi. We'll ask someone else.
You just have to help us.
Santa's supposed to help people.
Look, you don't mention
this Santa thing to Ayla, OK?
Why not, Rýza Abi?
It's great.
I don't want that.
OK, Rýza Abi. You help us
and we won't say anything.
I'll just sit there.
I'm not saying anything. OK?
Come on, Rýza Abi. Please!
- What am I supposed to tell the guy?
- You know, say he's young...
...he needs things, he's a good kid.
Fine, OK.
Do your problems never end?
The bride's side should help too.
The years are just flying by,
but I tell you, so are our lives.
Well, the situation is like this.
What was his name?
Carry on, Rýza Abi.
Now, as the groom's side...
we've tried to do what we can.
But because the money's limited...
I said what I have to say before.
As we've spared the boy's life,
we're having no part in the costs.
Dad, you get the picture about
what kind of person I am, right?
Don't call me 'dad'.
Call me 'Ali Amca'.
Of course, Ali Amca.
If you could help us out...
...we'd sort this thing out faster.
Plus the bad blood would be gone.
The day the girl's belly shows,
in other words when people realize...
...if the wedding hasn't happened
then we'll kill you.
We won't speak to the girl either.
Dad, basically...
Shhh! We won't speak to her.
For life.
Once we're married
everything will be sorted, right?
No. Then we'll stop speaking
to both of you.
You're leaving now.
And I'll look at the news.
Ekber, turn on the news.
Rýza Abi, let's ask to leave.
They've told us to already. Move.
At least we softened them up a bit.
Sure, Lokman. Sure.
The guys are soft as halva now.
Rýza?
How was it?
You should have seen, Ayla.
The warmth, the welcome!
The guy insisted on killing a rooster.
And I said, "We only came fortea."
"But the groom's here," he said.
That's all he said.
Was he really nasty?
The guy was eating nuts
the whole time.
Ayla, Rýza Abi, think about it!
If the guys kill me, you'll be left
with Þermin and the baby!
I'll give my life. I'll be fine.
But what about you?
Will you throw
my girl and baby out on the street?
Ayla, what did they pin on you
at your wedding?
What's that got to do with it?
Rýza Abi, whoever pinned most,
we should ask them to the wedding.
Ask your brother-in-law
about the gold, Lokman.
Are you trying
to say something, Ayla?
I'd have taken it out now
and maybe given it to my brother.
We're talking about
my brother's life, Rýza.
I say Ayla should stop being proud
and go ask our older brother direct.
He should help us. What is this?
I reckon he will if you ask, Ayla.
Don't be an idiot, Lokman.
Let your brother-in-law ask.
I'm never going in that house again.
The guy shoved us out.
I've had the best idea!
Rýza Abi should go to Friday prayers,
ask my brother with everyone there...
...and we'd get help
from the congregation too.
Nice one, Lokman.
Rýza, go to Friday prayers.
Hey, don't spill the crumbs!
What's this, eating at this time?
The boy was hungry.
Hello there, Nilüfer Haným.
Umm, if I asked to go for lunch
half an hour early...
...what would Serkan Bey say?
- What do you want to do?
Well, go to Friday prayers.
Right... Go half an hour early
and we'll handle it, if he asks.
- But don't be late back.
- Sure. Thanks. See you later.
Selam aleykum, Ahmet Abi.
Aleykum selam.
- Let me kiss your hand, Abi.
- No, you don't have to.
- May God accept your prayers.
- May God accept your prayers.
Dear brothers,
the theme of my sermon is new year.
New year is not
one of our customs.
God ordains in the Koran...
Le küm dini küm veliyediin.
Your religion is your affair
and mine is mine.
In fact, there is no cause
for debate either.
The Lord makes
no distinction between days.
Celebration for whatever reason
is good, enjoyment is desirable.
But it's no basis for committing sin
just because that day is new year.
OK, new year celebrations are fine.
They're international. They're good.
Ahmet Abi, I expect you've told them,
but while everyone's here...
...we have a wedding coming up.
Yusuf Lokman's wedding. We're expecting you.
You never said, Ahmet. Aren't you
planning to ask us to the wedding?
Well, of course. Come along.
It's only a wedding.
Thanks a lot, thanks.
Do you have my permission?
Well, that's what
we're after, Ahmet Abi.
Ayla says we should have
a proper wedding for everyone.
Well, OK. You have my permission.
Now go stew in your own juice!
But there's also the money side.
Money... Money, huh?
You lot just have your eyes on money!
Why would we have our eyes on money?
Lokman says you should at least
pay for the wedding hall.
Look, just do me a favour.
Get off my back!
There's no hope, Lokman.
You're kidding, Rýza Abi.
I really pushed for it but...
You call that being a brother?
Is that it?
Drop it! They're expecting me
back at the store. See you later.
You did it in the middle of everyone?
- Sure. I asked everyone to the wedding.
Although we can't do a wedding,
but I said we expected everyone.
So where are we going to
find the money?
Whoever we ask to borrow from,
they say they already lent you money.
What?
Not all of them.
They're just being mean.
- Look at the son of a bitches!
- Where are we going to find the money?
How do I know, Lokman?
I have things to do, you know!
And you call yourself Santa!
Well, the imam didn't say a lot,
but he didn't rave about it either.
Basically, he said
it wasn't one of our customs.
But what's it to us?
We don't even celebrate new year.
What did my brother say?
"Go stew in your own juice.
It's got nothing to do with me."
Unbelievable!
He said decorating trees was OK,
but you know, not to go overboard.
Everyone drinks alcohol, right?
- Take it easy there, girls.
- Thanks.
I've got another favour to ask.
I have to be at court tomorrow.
It's just an old case from the past.
What would Serkan Bey say
if I asked for half a day off?
- He'd say your problems never end.
- He would, wouldn't he?
Find someone to stand in for you.
Tomorrow's the first hearing.
The lawyer said I had to be there.
Not in court. A stand-in Santa.
Oh, right. That would be OK?
We'll take care ofit.
- But just a half-day.
- Sure only a half-day.
But who am I going to find?
Well, I'll find someone.
There's nothing to it.
Do a deep voice like this.
Hoh-hoh-hoh...
You're a guy with a huge belly.
It's more like this. Ho-ho-ho!
Rýza Abi,
is that white beard itchy?
A bit, but you get used to it.
Kids have photos taken with you.
There's nothing to it.
The beard is good too. OK.
Please, Lokman.
Don't let me down.
If Serkan Bey walks past
don't let him see you. Keep quiet.
- OK, Rýza.
- All set?
OK. Now do your stuff, Lokman.
See you later.
It's a temporary job,
until the new year.
You work six days a week
and they pay 40 lira a day.
I did a calculation.
It works out at around 1000 lira
by the end of the month.
So you said half the fee,
but it's only like half of that.
OK, Rýza. No problem.
Muhammed Yazýcý, Handan Tektaþ,
Rýza Þenyurt...
Stand up, please.
Sit down.
Sorry.
One guy said it's harmful, another said
it isn't...
...the report said it could be.
Then my lot said it was a plot.
And the judge postponed it two months.
Is this jolly life
going to land us in trouble?
I don't know.
No one's taken back their charges.
Tonguç Abi, I'll pay half upfront
and half after the wedding night.
After what?
You know, half upfront,
half when it's all over.
What are you talking about?
OK, I'll pay the whole lot
when it's all over.
I want the whole lot upfront.
Come on, Tonguç Abi.
Don't do this, please!
I'll pay half upfront,
half after the honeymoon.
Pay the rest
instead of going on honeymoon.
OK, OK.
What date's free?
The 31st.
What, 31 December?
Great, 31 December.
Hey, it's new year that day!
Aha. That's why it's free.
Timur, you have to write something...
...that's like a wedding invitation
plus a new year thing.
New year what?
What new year thing do you think
if it's the wedding that day?
- I don't understand the question.
- Find something. What are we going to write?
'A new year's party wedding!'
No, we can't have 'party'.
My brother Ahmet hates that word.
OK... 'We're starting
the new year with a wedding'.
'The new year with a wedding...'
Bravo, Timur. You're the best!
What a star. Write that down.
Timur, you know how you used to
nick money off your mum now and then?
- Yes?
- Can you nick a bit more?
How much?
Around 500, something like that.
So you're saying
rob your own house.
How much can you get?
50 maximum. Anything
small enough not to be noticed.
Small enough not to be noticed!
What am I supposed to do, Timur?
You need to nick at least 200 or so.
Timur... Timur...
What have you done
about the wedding?
Hopefully we'll be having it
on new year's eve.
- New year's eve?
- Hopefully.
Hopefully.
- Do you want some tea?
- We don't drink tea.
Tea is for drinking from real men.
Not from inconsistent types.
Inconsistent?
Inconsistent. You know,
saying things that don't match.
Ignorant, something like that.
Oh, OK. They weren't that bad then.
OK, that's great.
70, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 145...
What are you doing?
140 and a bit.
Tell him 150.
Nursel Abla sold my necklaces.
Don't spend it right away.
They may want it back.
You and your snide comments...
I'll handle that, baby.
I told you, I'll handle it.
Why are you crying?
Please!
Look, Þermin.
Shall I talk through my nose?
Þermin, don't cry, baby.
Þermin, don't cry, baby.
Look, OK, baby.
Why are you crying?
- Rýza...
- What?
What's this?
Our wedding present to you.
300?
We bust ourselves to come up with it.
It's all we've got.
Thanks, but the guy wants
2500 lira for the wedding hall.
Whatever. I'll give him 1500.
That's enough.
Who else is he going to
sell new year's eve to?
The wedding's on new year's eve?
There's no otherfree day, Ayla.
I can't wait. There's no time.
Will people come to the wedding
that night?
- People who don't celebrate will.
- People who celebrate won't.
So we forget half the guests, right?
What's that?
Abi, take it. I'll get together
the rest by the day of the wedding.
I've put in 200 as well.
So how are we doing this now?
- Didn't you say 2500, Abi?
- Yes.
- Then you brought it down to 2000.
- No, I didn't.
Then do it now.
I'll get togetherthe rest
by the wedding and pay it then.
There's 480 lira here.
Timur?
Well, I just stuck my hand in
and grabbed what was there.
So I guess it was 180.
Timur!
Abi, round it up to 500.
Hey, what is this?
"Bring it down, round it up..."
Tonguç Abi, please!
They'll pin money on us
at the wedding, right?
I'll pay you back out of that.
They'll pin money, huh?
Seeing I've halved the price...
...I want the full amount
before the day of the wedding.
Why did you say that?
I had a hard time doing it,
that's why.
Why did you say it in front ofhim?
Look, I do the talking. You keep quiet.
I'm handling it.
Why do you butt in?
- I expect you at the wedding, Rafi Abi.
- I want my money, Lokman Abi.
Don't worry, Abi. Don't worry.
Take it easy there.
Thanks.
Timur, what ar e you doing?
They're from the same family.
The invitations are for two.
Oh God, Timur!
I expect you
at the wedding, Caner Abi.
Take it easy there, Þakir Abi.
Thanks, Lokman.
Welcome, Lokman.
Bon apetite.
I've brought you
a wedding invitation.
However mad we are at each other
you're still my elder.
I thought it my duty
to bring you this.
I'm trying to do something
off my own back.
If you come to the wedding too
it'll be an end to the bad blood.
Will you have something to eat,
Yusuf Lokman?
No thanks, Yenge.
I don't have time.
OK, see you then.
Son of a bitch! You addressed
it to 'My Brother Ahmet Bal'.
Aren't you my brotherfor God's sake?
No, I'm damn well not!
See you at the wedding, Yenge.
The boy's right.
Aren't you his brother?
No!
Give me the salt.
Duran Abi?
Knock harder, Sýrrý Abi.
They may be asleep.
Duran Abi!
Hello, Sýrrý.
- Good evening, Abi.
- God bless, Abi.
It's OK.
Go back to bed.
Duran Abi, Rýza is all keen
to sort out that debt business.
Let's not drag it out, Duran Abi.
It isn't right. We're neighbours here.
If you pull out,
the other guys will too.
If the money you're making
an issue about was serious money.
Where's he going?
Well, you said
"If the money was serious money..."
- Well, isn't it true?
- No.
What's this?
Whoever cheated you,
sue them too.
That's what I'm doing.
Give me my money back.
Good night, Sýrrý.
Everyone should sue everyone else.
He's a teacher.
He should tell people to make peace.
Come on, let's go.
For goodness sake!
Just look at the guy.
Look, I've been cheated too.
Why don't you understand that?
What am I supposed to have done?
Capitals around the world are all set...
...to celebrate new year's eve tomorrow.
As always, Australia will be first
to usher in the new year.
Melbourne and Sydney are set for
a sensational new year celebration.
Sydney will be staging its biggest
new year's extravaganza to date...
...with 5 tons of fireworks.
Welcome, Rýza.
Lokman... Lokman!
What is it, Timur?
Where's the money?
They'll be pinning
money on us at the wedding, right?
- I'll pay you right there.
- What if no one pins anything?
Are you crazy, Abi?
You're talking Lokman's wedding!
That's exactly what I'm saying.
It's your wedding.
What if no one pins anything?
Abi, please.
Just show a bit willing.
Look, it's me doing the decorations
even though I'm the groom. You see?
Look, ifl don't get the money on time
I'm turning off the trip switch.
- You hear that, Nusret?
- Yes, Abi.
Get to it then.
The trip switch?
You know that thing
going into the fuse box?
OK, I know, Timur.
You think I don't know
what a trip switch is?
Get back to work.
Blow up balloons with the kids.
Teaching me what a trip switch is.
The motorbike guy is
at the door, Rýza Abi.
The addresses are written here.
Do the deliveries and come back.
- OK. I do the ho-ho-ho thing, right?
- Abi, you're Santa.
The ho-ho is standard.
You do that everywhere.
So inside the homes is OK too?
Sure. Get people excited.
Do your stuff. OK, good luck.
See you later.
Ho-ho-ho!
Happy new year!
Come over here now.
I'm Santa Claus.
I've brought you presents.
Come and see
what I've got in here.
I'm Santa
so I can make you fly!
Thank you.
Happy new year to you all.
Thanks, to you too.
It's great making the kids laugh.
Alaaddin, the woman gave me 10 lira.
So 5 foryou, 5 for me.
- Nice one.
- Here.
Thanks.
No wait, she gave me 9.
So 4 for me, 5 for you.
Hello joy...
Goodbye sorrow...
New year, new year,
New year is beautiful...
Once upon a time
It was a fairytale,
It's a visitor... It's a passing thing...
It's a person...
Life flies by...
Life flies by...
Every new day
is a gift to us...
Hello hope...
Goodbye sorrow...
New year, new year,
New year is beautiful...
Ho-ho-ho! Happy new year!
Happy new year, everyone!
Rýza Abi,
it's time to knock off.
I'm going to be
cruising around tonight.
Tell me where you'll be
and maybe I'll stop by.
Well, we'll be moving around too.
Well, what can I say?
I guess I'll be going.
I didn't do such a great job
but I did the best I could do.
I think you were great, Rýza Abi.
You were too.
Thanks, really.
If I messed up at all,
you'll have to forgive me.
- Merry Christmas, Rýza Abi.
- What?
Turgut, what are you doing here?
I'll get changed and be with you.
I'm not here foryou, Abi.
Honey, get ready and let's go.
I'm all set.
Happy new year, Rýza Abi.
Hopefully you'll be
our Santa every year.
- Happy new year, Serkan Bey.
- Happy new year.
Happy new year now.
- Happy new year, Turgut.
- See you.
- See you. Happy new year.
- Happy new year.
The tosser shows up
and walks off with the girl...
...right in front of your eyes.
You didn't get the chance to talk.
What can you do, Abi?
You get embarrassed. You can't say.
Right. You get embarrassed.
I'll tell you something for example.
Right now, my wife
doesn't know I'm being Santa.
- She doesn't know?
- No.
Haven't you told her?
Why not?
Same reason as you
not being able to say anything.
But still, you get used to it,
you know?
I've really got used to this job.
Whenever kids see you
they bubble with laughter.
I've never seen anything like it.
You're Santa after all.
Make-believe or real.
The make-believe
kids believe in is basically real.
I think you should tell your wife,
Rýza Abi.
If she knew you worked 12 hours a day
to feed the household...
...and for a hard-ass boss like me...
...you think she'd give you hell?
- Don't say that! You're a good person.
OK, well happy new year.
Hope to see you all again.
Goodbye. See you again, Abi.
Serkan Bey,
can you give me a ride home?
- Where do you live?
- Beylikdüzü.
- Whoa!
- But right at the entrance.
Well, OK. Come on.
- Hey, get up off that costume.
- I'm only sitting on it.
But I want to sit on it.
- Selam aleykum.
- Aleykum selam.
Nazmi, thanks foryour hard work.
Rýza Þenyurt... Just a second.
Witnesses!
What was Santa like?
Great, really.
Fantastic, amazing.
I wasn't fantastic.
I just did what I could.
You were good.
Here, Abi. Look, I'm here
at this time just for you.
OK, happy new year, all of you.
Let's pack up here. Happy new year.
What's up, Ayla?
Who says so?
Didn't you say we'd pay him
out of the money pinned on them?
Did your brother Ahmet show up?
OK, honey. I'm on my way.
OK, OK. I'll be right there.
- Come on, let's go.
- What are you doing tonight?
I'm staying in, Abi. You?
Here, let me grab one end
of the chips.
I'm off to a wedding.
Can you believe it?
What, a wedding tonight?
Aha. My brother-in-law
fixed his wedding for tonight.
- It's Rýza Abi's wedding?
- Right. He's getting hitched tonight.
What? You got the money together
to renew your wedding vows, Rýza?
Cut the jokes. It's not my wedding.
It's my brother-in-law's.
OK, Rýza Abi.
Happy new year.
Well, guys. I've got used to you
but I guess it's time to say goodbye.
But aren't you Santa, Abi?
Well, OK. What more could
a neighbourhood kid want, Abi?
Exactly!
What more could he want?
I'm both Santa
and host at a wedding.
Rýza Abi, go and show them
what the real Santa is like.
What is this? Go and show them.
You're not Spider Man.
- Happy new year.
- Happy new year, all of you.
I'll drop the costume off
at the office in the next day or so.
OK, thanks a lot.
Ho-ho-ho! See you then.
My God, I've been
in this neighbourhood since 1972...
...and you're the first Santa
I've ever seen.
What's up, Santa?
Ho-ho. I'm just going to the wedding.
Lokman's wedding?
Wait, I'll give you directions.
You'll neverfind
where the chimney is.
Sure I will. Why wouldn't I,
Köksal Abi? Shame on you!
You... Rýza?
Happy new year, Köksal Abi.
Ho-ho-ho, Köksal Abi!
Alcohol?
Where can I get it, Timur?
For God's sake!
Is my brother Ahmet here?
Not yet.
For God's sake! Ahmet isn't here
and you're asking for alcohol.
Timur, don't make problems.
Solve them, go on.
OK, OK.
Tonguç Abi?
What are you doing? Please!
Look! Is this the deal we made?
Do I have to come running after you?
Abi, I promise I'll pay.
It's shameful in front of Þermin, Abi.
No, that's it. It's over.
Nusret, kick everyone out.
Abi, it's shameful to everyone.
Am I supposed to run afteryou?
Where's the money?
I swear I'll pay, Tonguç Abi.
Ho-ho-ho!
Happy new year, everyone!
Here you go, Lokman.
Turn on the lights!
They're here!
Really, they've come!
I said my brother was kind at heart,
I said he was a sweetheart!
I did, Yenge! Really!
Where are we going to sit?
Come with me.
I've saved you the best place.
Come on... Here.
Dear guests,
dear guests of honour...
...let's have a round of applause
for tonight's happy couple.
Where did you get the money?
- Santa brought it.
- Who?
Santa.
Ho-ho-ho! Happy new year!
Happy new year, girls!
Dear guests.
Oh, sorry.
Hold this.
Dear guests, I had a call today
from the groom, Yusuf Lokman.
"Santa," he said.
"My wedding falls on new year's eve."
"I wonder if you could drop by?"
And I said,
"How did you manage that?"
I said,
"Of course I'll drop by, my friend."
And then I went, "Ho-ho-ho!"
Well, I may be Santa,
but I have a problem. My sack is empty.
But what good is Santa
if his sack is empty?
- No good!
- What good is he, kids?
He's no good at all.
So what are we going to do?
- Fill the sack!
- Fill the sack! Bravo, Sezer!
Now, we're going to
start this job with Ahmet Bal.
Ahmet Abi is one of the wedding hosts.
So we'll start with Ahmet Bal.
Let's hear some applause for him.
Over here, kids.
Don't suffocate the man.
Let him drop
something big in there.
But, Ahmet Abi. Watch out.
You're the lead for everyone else.
People will look to you...
What was that?
We've got some jewellery.
Thanks. You give the jewellery, Yenge.
And Ahmet Abi, you present the cash.
Isn't that right?
Now, that's a gift of... is it 200?
No, 400.
Here we go then.
Do your stuff, everyone!
Fill that sack now! Let's see you!
Give whatever you feel like.
Wait, hold on!
Five pieces of gold
from the bride's mother.
A round of applause
for the bride's mother!
A round of applause!
Now let's hear the music!
Rýza Abi, we have a pile of
jewellery here, we have money...
Good.
I hope it does you well.
Thanks, Rýza Abi.
Þermin, my love,
may I have this dance?
Don't, Lokman!
You really make me laugh.
It's not good for the bride
to laugh a lot.
OK, OK.
Rýza Abi, you keep this.
OK, I'll give it back later.
Hello, Santa.
Ho-ho, Ayla Haným!
Now I understand that sack business,
that talk of standing at the door.
This is easy though.
I was a slipper once. A 2m slipper.
It got so hot inside.
Why did you hide it from me?
It happens that way sometimes.
If you set your sights high
it gets depressing...
being stuck down at the bottom.
Then you give everything to something...
...you're ashamed of doing and you're
ashamed of what you give everything to.
Red really suits you.
Thanks.
They keep going on about having
their photo taken with Santa.
- OK, right away.
- Ahmet, take the picture.
Sure, right away.
We're family, aren't we?
OK, happy new year then
to all of you.
What is this, Rýza Efendi?
You're all dressed up
in foreigners' clothes.
Aren't you ashamed to be
clowning around at this age?
Why should I be? I'm Santa.
I'm not clowning around.
Santa?
May God mend your ways!
All of us together, inshallah!
Here you are, Rýza Abi.
Hand that over.
I'm dying of thirst.
Hey, is there vodka in this?
We put vodka in. But there's
alcohol-free too if you want.
No. I'll make do
seeing you've poured it.
Cheers!
Off you go, bismillah!
There we go.
Have your sack back,
but let me get my shoes out first.
Take the money inside.
- That's yours, Rýza Abi.
- Mine? How do you mean?
You need it more.
This jewellery
is enough for us, Rýza Abi.
Hey, come on!
Don't be crazy!
Well, may God make you happy,
Santa Efendi.
All of us, all of us.
May God keep us from the evil eye!
- May God grant a happy ending!
- Amen... Thanks, Ahmet Abi.
- Happy new year.
- Good night.
Goodbye then.
Good night.
Good night, Rýza.
Happy new year, Yenge.
Happy new year.
Ayla... Are those snowflakes?
Aha.
Nice. Snow is meant for new year.
Kids love it.
Come on, let's go home.
We have one more thing to do.
Let's get that sorted first.
You wait here a minute.
I'll be right back.
OK.
Happy new year! Ho-ho-ho!
Whoa, Santa! Come on in!
What are you doing here?
I've brought you presents.
OK. Bring them here.
Hold this, Aytekin. Go on.
Hold it.
Sorry, I'm putting it on the table
like this...
...but I have to go.
Sorry.
Thanks, Aytekin.
Well, to be honest
I haven't counted this lot.
You guys count it, then divide it
in four and give me your blessing.
If it's still short,
I'll make it up later.
Rýza?
Sýrrý Abi?
Happy new year to you.
Happy new year, Abi.
I hope that's the worst year
we'll ever have.
OK, then. Ho-ho!
Happy new year!
Ayla? You know this really.
You don't need honey or anything.
Your mind just needs to be
free of troubles.
Well? How's your mind now?
Not bad.
Hey, don't laugh!
Don't laugh.
10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5...
4... 3...
2... 1... 0...
