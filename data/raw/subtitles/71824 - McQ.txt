- Hi, Sarge.
- AI.
What are you doing up at this hour?
- Night shift.
- Want the usual?
Just some milk.
How's McQ? Haven't seen him lately.
You know, Lon and his boat.
He's living on it.
How's the gut?
It's not bad.
Good. I got something cooking out back.
- You need anything, give a holler.
- Right.
Hello.
Nuts.
Yeah?
Lon, J.C., did you hear?
What?
I'm sorry, Lon.
Stan went down this morning.
- How bad?
-Shotgun in the back. He's in Harborview. 
They're working on him there. 
Get Doc Merar over there.
He's here.
- Lois would like to see you.
-How's she doing? 
Gutsy. Holding up.
Don't leave her alone.
Get a policewoman with her.
Now, what happened?
Don't know. No witnesses.
Coffee shop guy heard the blast,
but didn't see a thing.
Well, pull the package on Manny Santiago.
I want an intelligence update on him,
and I want to see Stan's log.
Lon, two other officers got taken off, too.
Nine millimeter.
Beat man named Hyatt
and Wally Johnson.
You know,
he works the night watch in Property.
Yeah.
Kosterman thinks it's militants. 
See you.
Hold it!
- All right, now. Just stay back.
- Don't worry.
You know him, Lieutenant?
Patty Samuels. I know him.
He's a hit man. He was waiting for me.
Pete, call the medical examiner.
I better have that for the inquest,
Lieutenant.
Hey, mister, that was a hell of a shot.
I called the cops for you.
Yeah, thanks.
- You saw what happened?
- I saw you shoot him.
- And before that?
- I saw him blasting away at you.
Good. Now I want you
to repeat what you saw...
just exactly the way it happened.
- Hey, look, I don't wanna get involved.
- You already are.
I have a tape recorder here.
- Are you a cop?
- Yeah.
Tell him what happened.
Officer, witness this.
- Well, hell, I was just on my way to work...
- Name and address first.
My name is James Carter,
and I live at 1131 N. 74th.
I was on my way to work this morning...
when I saw this guy trying
to break into this car, some young kid.
And then this guy came out
and chased him away...
and this other guy
started shooting at him, see.
And then the first guy blasted him.
You know, it was a hell of a shot.
- Lon.
- Stan's tough, Lois.
Don't forget it.
- How bad?
- Critical.
He liked to work, Lon.
He thought being a cop was the greatest.
Well, he's still a cop,
and he's still gonna be one.
Sure.
I'm not surprised he was shot.
I've been expecting it.
All wives expect it these days,
don't you know that?
Some crazy getting it off,
a radical doing his number.
We don't have to talk about it now.
You've got some questions,
though, haven't you?
Well, another time.
It's all right.
Police work never stops, does it?
I'm sorry, Lon.
What do you wanna know?
I know he was taking you
to a show last night.
How did he end up alone?
He got a call.
From whom?
I don't know, but it was important.
I could see his face.
I could feel the tightening in his stomach.
You know how he was.
- Did you hear what was said?
- Just pieces.
Well, I have a feeling it had something
to do with...
the drive on against the dealers.
Just a feeling, that's all.
The department dries up the city,
someone tries to dry up Stan.
Any names mentioned?
Manny Santiago's, for instance?
No.
I would have remembered that for sure.
Lois, I hate to,
but I'm just gonna to have to go.
- Can I call somebody, a friend?
- Lon, don't baby me.
I'm tough, too, remember?
We'll all be back out
on that boat again soon.
You'll see.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Calling Dr. Denon. 
Okay, let's go. Everybody out.
Hold it down in there!
- Good morning, Captain.
- Good morning.
I'm in the communications
center right now.
Yeah.
Capt. Kosterman just walked in. Yes, sir.
Chief, the mayor wants to see you.
- Tell him I'm on my way.
- He's on his way.
All right, Ed. It's your ball game.
I want your best people on this,
and I want quick action.
Yes, sir.
This gets top priority.
If there's anything you need, just ask.
I'll talk to you when I get back.
- How's Stan?
- He's hanging in there.
Boy, that's rough.
Homicide's looking for you.
They want your papers
on the Patty Samuels thing.
And the captain's looking for you.
I think you've got him worried.
I put Stan's log on your desk
and the Santiago stuff.
All the same.
Arrested on a felony,
booked on a misdemeanor, released.
- Yeah, he beats them all.
- Yeah.
I got us fight tickets for Thursday.
Don't suppose we'll be needing them now.
My schedule will be busy.
See you.
You know, your Green Hornet
is an attractive nuisance.
Someday, somebody's gonna rip it off.
Maybe me.
You can have the payments, too.
- Capt. Kosterman wants to see you.
- Dean.
Have one of the girls type that up,
will you?
Good morning, Frank.
Watching Kosterman's show?
Sorry about Stan. How is he doing?
- He's trying.
- Yeah.
Listen, if there's anything I can do for him,
for Lois, you'll let me know, will you?
Thanks.
Hey, McQ.
What is this asinine police crap?
This is illegal arrest, man.
This is unconstitutional,
and you damn well know it.
This whole damn place is coming down,
you know that?
You pigs will be out of work,
but don't worry. We'll put you on welfare.
That's all your stinking job is anyway.
Come on, pig. Shoot me.
Pull your piece and blow me up right here.
What's the matter? No guts?
Chicken?
God!
- What happened?
- He bumped into a chair.
Chair?
Good morning.
- Almost got you.
- Close enough.
- You know how I feel about this.
- I saw the hallways.
Garbage.
The whole place smells like rotten cheese.
We're gonna have to fumigate.
Ed, I think we should be
looking for something else.
I'm willing to look at anything.
But uniformed officers
shot down in the streets...
that smells like radicals to me.
How about Patty Samuels
unloading on me?
That's not radical.
Somebody thought Stan
had told me something.
You're still harping on that Santiago thing.
Why not?
Ed, I want this case.
No, not this one. I already put Burt on it.
Stan and you are too close friends.
You know how the department
feels about that.
Emotional involvement
clouds clear judgment.
We both know all you have
to do is just say the word.
Well, I'm not saying it.
Lon, I know you.
I'm not gonna stand for you
making up your own rules.
You're not gonna play
that Mickey Peters thing all over again.
Peters was a hood, and everybody knew it.
You weren't satisfied
with throwing him up on the roof.
You had to go up there
and throw him back down.
Six months in the hospital...
four lawyers screaming
about his civil rights.
Well, it kept him off the street, didn't it?
Yeah, and that's why I'm behind a desk
and you're taking orders from me.
Now, cool it.
- Telephone, Captain.
- Thank you.
Lon, cool it. Don't go away.
I'm not finished yet.
Capt. Kosterman.
No. All press inquiries
go to Chief Grogan's desk.
That goes for lawyers, too.
No, I don't want to talk to them.
Capt. Bennerman, Internal Affairs.
- Good morning, Mr. Santiago.
- Good morning.
- Bob, I thought you'd be in court today.
- No, that's tomorrow.
I was worried about the detective
who was shot last night.
I'm afraid there may be repercussions.
Why should that be?
I did not shoot him.
I was on an overnight plane
from Mexico City.
I know that, Manuel.
But it's my responsibility to caution you...
about the possibility of harassment.
- Good morning, Mr. Santiago.
- Good morning, Chris.
Harassment. Such a nice lawyer's word.
Thank you, Bob. You're very conscientious.
How is he?
Critical.
Shame.
... handling the modern supertankers, 
eliminating the need for ships to travel. 
Detective Sgt. Stan Boyle died
late this morning... 
at Harborview Hospital... 
victim of shotgun wounds
sustained early this morning. 
Boyle's assailant remains at large. 
Police investigations continue. 
This is your weather girl, Barbara Bogey... 
with today's report
on Seattle and vicinities. 
High today in the upper 50s. 
Low overnight 42.
Cloudy, clearing in the late afternoon. 
What was just on the news?
Sorry. I wasn't paying any attention.
The detective that got shot this morning,
he died.
... 400 miles
off the coast of British Columbia... 
with a cold front extending
west-southwest... 
Two climbers from Washington state
are reported missing... 
So, one less detective to worry about.
Yeah, one less detective to worry about.
I got a message from Patty Samuels.
He's sorry he blew it on McQ,
but he rang it up with Boyle.
Send that widow a Japanese tea set.
- Who are you?
- Who? I'll show you who.
That's who.
Patty Samuels made
a deathbed statement.
You put up $10,000
to go bang on Boyle and me.
- You're insane!
- Yeah?
What's the matter? No confession?
Even under duress?
He's taking a shower.
The damn phones haven't stopped ringing.
Upstairs, the city council.
The man has clout.
What did you expect?
His lawyer was gonna let it die?
I never touched him.
Sure, we talked,
but he slipped on the wet floor and fell.
He says otherwise. So do his men.
They're his men.
You're off the investigation, Lieutenant,
pending review.
What's all this?
Everybody knows that Santiago
is the biggest dealer in the city...
in spite of his cover.
Intelligence knows it, and so do the feds.
His "H" comes in from Canada by mule...
Just file your report, Lieutenant.
The commission will be pleased
to consider whatever you have to say.
A date will be set for the review board,
and you will be notified.
That's it.
Until further notice, you're on a desk.
I tried to warn you.
No, wait.
- Wait a minute, Lon, don't do that.
- Too much politics.
Come on. Don't do that.
Go away and think about it.
You put in too many years here, Lon.
You got a damn good record
of arrests and convictions.
Frank, let him go.
He was never part of the team anyway.
Yeah, run it smooth.
Don't do anything. Don't rock the boat.
- You mean to infer that...
- I can infer anything I want now, Chief.
I'm a civilian again.
What happened?
Run this through the lab for me, will you?
See if you can get me a make.
- Lon?
- I'll call you.
- Lois?
- I hope you don't mind my coming down.
I just couldn't sit home.
Glad you did.
Welcome aboard.
My high-heel shoes.
You can't hurt these decks.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
No.
Let me fake it.
Thanks for holding my hand at the funeral.
Big turnout, wasn't it?
Stan had a lot of friends,
that kind of a fella.
The city went all out.
Fifty motorcycles, all that media coverage.
God, why does anybody want to be a cop?
How about a drink?
Yeah.
I'm glad now we never had any kids.
Maybe it would have been better
having some. Who knows?
It's all right. Alcohol purifies.
How do you stand it, this living in solitary?
You get used to it.
Water or soda?
It doesn't matter.
You should get yourself a woman.
She'd at least straighten up for you.
Not enough for them anymore.
Women's lib, you know.
Growing up, isn't she?
You still do your Sundays?
Wouldn't miss them for anything.
Why should you?
If you've got something good, keep it.
I saw your ex in the papers.
She and Forrester
at some lawyers' meeting.
He sure got up there all of a sudden.
I'm glad for her.
Lois, what are your plans?
I don't know. I'm all mixed-up.
Lon, can I be your sister?
Sure.
I'd like that.
All I had were three brothers.
We were always banging knuckles.
Then let's do something crazy, brother.
Let's get in your car and go someplace.
Canada.
Let's get lost for about 10 years. Yes.
Ten years is just about right.
It's all right, isn't it?
Get it out.
It's all right. It's over.
I am tough, see?
What about you?
I heard you quit.
Congratulations.
Nothing lost.
Creeps have made all the gains.
Cops get to listen to lots of organ music.
Go get yourself a good job.
Yeah.
I parked in your spot.
It doesn't matter.
The car's in the shop anyway.
- New bills.
- Yeah.
Sorry about Boyle.
Yeah.
Want a beer?
No, thanks.
Pinky, I want to come in with you.
Lon, there's hardly enough for me.
Some bad checks, door shaking.
Even divorce has gone sour.
Dissolution is putting us out of business.
No salary.
I need the cover of your license, Pinky.
Looking for a base?
That's right. I'll bring my own client.
- Who?
- Me.
I get it. Stan's killing.
Do-it-yourself gumshoeing.
Why quit?
Why don't you just take a leave?
Freer this way.
There's a lot of badasses on the street
carrying your bruises.
They'd love to catch you without the
protection of the departmental umbrella.
Well, that's part of the bundle, Pinky.
How about it?
Well, if that's what you want,
we'll get you registered.
Gee, will Kosterman get hot.
Okay, sign right there, will you, Lon?
His name's Freddie LaSalle.
He's a contract man from St. Louis.
How did he get by the airport watch?
Who knows? Drove in.
Any surveillance on him?
Would be if we could find him.
How about intelligence? Why is he here?
Nothing.
Well, I'm located now. Pinky's.
You got his number?
I can get it.
I'm depending on you
to keep me up on things.
Well, I'll do what I can, Lon,
but my neck only goes out so far.
That's the only way to go.
Rosey? It's me.
Did you get any more...
None of your snitches will help you now.
They know you can't deal anymore.
The hell I can't.
- Don't park it. I'm not staying.
- Yes, sir.
- Lon, this is a surprise.
- Yeah. Nice party.
We're trying to raise some money
for a foster-parent program.
It's awful about Stan.
I tried to reach Lois. I'll keep trying.
- I heard you resigned.
- That's right.
I'm glad.
I'm sorry, too...
that it didn't happen a long time ago.
Is Ginger around? Back from school?
She should be here any minute.
Elaine, I need $5,000.
I hope it's for a woman.
Someone patient, brave, and caring...
who doesn't break out in rashes
being left alone at night.
I'll have to ask Walter.
Hello, Lon.
- You're looking fit.
- You, too.
How about Elaine?
- Looks marvelous, doesn't she?
- Always did.
- Walter, Lon wants $5,000.
- A loan.
I have $6,000 or $7,000
coming from my pension...
but I won't get it for three months,
and I need the money right now.
- All right.
- I've drawn up this paper.
The fund will pay you directly.
That's not necessary, Lon.
Just pay me back when you can.
I'd rather do it this way.
All right. I'll get a check.
Goodbye.
Daddy! Hi!
Hello, Ginger.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.
Look at this, 99 out of a 100. I'm a genius.
I've got a couple of tickets
to the Sunday basketball game.
How about it?
Dad, Jane invited me to her house
at the marina.
She's having a boy-girl party, my first one.
Then you'll have to go to Janie's.
- Maybe next week.
- Lf there's not another party.
I'm getting very popular.
I think it's my charm.
I called the bank...
and told them you'd be down to cash it.
There will be no difficulty.
Thanks, Walter.
I'll see you.
What's the score?
The Lakers are doing it
to them righteously.
There's my man.
I'm gonna transact some business.
Why don't you get something to eat?
Get Daddy something, too, here,
and you be really sweet to yourself.
What you got for me, my man?
That's all right. Walsh is playing?
I'll tell you what, I'm going to run three
on this one, and two...
Watch it.
Baby, give me the hot dogs.
Stay right here.
Daddy's got some more business
to take care of.
- Hello, Rosey.
- I don't have to talk to you.
You're not the heat anymore,
you know what I mean?
- Like, you're useless.
- Hold it, Rosey.
What are you going to do?
Go fist city on me?
I can dig that,
you know, a week in the hospital.
Rest and relaxation for me,
you know what I mean?
There's five bills in this newspaper.
I don't even sneeze for less than 10.
All right. Let's turn to the second section.
There's five more if it's beautiful.
Santiago has got company
from out of state.
Freddie LaSalle?
That's worth zip.
- Enjoy the game.
- There's more.
More hardware.
A cat by the name
of German Kaufman from Denver.
Two hit men.
Three.
A Lou Something-Or-Other from Miami.
Santiago is collecting a murder squad.
- Something else.
- What?
You'd be surprised how the cost of living...
- Has gone up in the black community.
- It stops right here.
A heist team.
A heist team?
Rosey, you're shining me on.
No, this is the straight skinny.
It must be something special.
Drugs?
You know Santiago. Now, what's his bag?
Did Stan find something out?
He's got his own connections.
You ask them.
I'm missing all the action, babe.
Rosey, if this is a shine...
I'm coming back and ironing your face.
Personally, I think it's worth more.
I'll get you some Blue Chip Stamps.
Cocaine, Sal? Let's have them, Sal.
The balloons. Spit them out.
- Spit them out!
- What the hell is this?
You ain't even a cop anymore!
- Go see some basketball.
- Basketball?
You've got a nerve,
picking your way in here.
What is this?
I've got a good mind to call a cop.
- So what?
- I thought you might be interested.
Why should I be? I'm no doper.
Where did you get that idea?
Look, I'm tired.
I've been hustling drinks for 10 hours.
My feet hurt, my back hurts,
and I need a bath.
So go on.
Let's cut through it, Myra.
You were a good friend
of Stan's in the past.
He was a nice guy. He was a gentleman.
It was a damn shame.
Not that there was ever
anything between us.
Personal, I mean.
We were just good friends.
Sure, I know that. He respected you.
- You bet he did.
- He brought the balloons...
and you spoke of things in general.
If I hear anything...
it's my civic duty to tell the right person.
Who else knows?
- Why don't you guys print up a program?
- Nobody knows, Myra.
I was just Stan's very good friend.
I talked only to Stan...
not his very good friend...
and I'm not talking to you.
I don't like you. I never did.
You're a bear.
I don't like bears. Out.
Okay.
Wait.
Skag or coke?
I don't go skag.
I know what you go, Myra.
Can I see one?
You have a bill handy?
"C" note. Class.
Roll it for me, will you, like a good fella?
Do you mind? It hurts my eyes.
You see, the lounge is dark all of the time,
so my pupils get dilated.
Dilated pupils
is a natural condition with me.
That's why some people think I'm a coker.
Myra, did Stan have some information?
Was that why he was killed?
Why don't you take off your coat?
Aren't you hot?
- Personally, I think it's hot.
- Know anything about a drug heist?
- Think I'm fat?
- No, I think you look real nice.
Yeah?
I'm fat. Baby fat.
It needs lifting. Even that won't help.
What I need is a complete overhaul.
Myra, I'm asking you something.
Sure, honey...
I'll tell you.
Be glad to...
in the morning.
You said I looked real nice. You said it.
Myra, in your job...
you must meet a lot
of younger men around.
Sure.
Phone rings day and night,
don't you know...
but I'm ignoring it.
I'm picking you, honey.
- How about some coffee?
- Hi.
I'll fix some bacon and eggs. Okay?
You cool it...
Thanks, Myra, but I got a big day.
Sure.
I'm busy myself.
I don't know what Stan knew.
I didn't tell him.
I didn't know myself until yesterday.
- Some hard rocks from out of town.
- What's the setup?
Drug heist, like you thought.
They're going
for the biggest stash in the city.
- Where?
- You're the detective.
Detect.
Give me some help.
Look where the men in blue hang out.
- I can't believe it.
- So go find out.
Only thing is, you better hurry.
- Hello, Joe.
- Hi, Lon, how are you doing?
All right.
- 2549, cocaine.
- Check.
- 2268, heroin.
- Check.
Hi, Steve.
Hi, Lon. What brings you around?
Just picking some stuff
up out of my locker.
- How's it going?
- Not bad.
The wife's having a little problem, though.
You know women.
- She's going to the hospital tomorrow.
- That's too bad.
- That concludes it. Sign here, please.
- Okay.
Would you believe
you're looking at over $2 million?
I sure would.
Where are they burning it
this time, Sarge?
- Beats me. State secret.
- See you.
Sorry.
What are you doing down there?
I'm looking for a restroom.
It's not down here.
It's upstairs and to the left.
Thanks.
- Howdy, Sarge.
- Good morning.
Drop the boxes! Drop them!
Dr. Chaplin to the emergency room, 
first floor. 
Take off!
Are you crazy?
Get out of that truck!
Open those rear doors.
- Who are you working for?
- I work for the laundry company.
Why did you blast through
those stop signs?
The way you was chasing me,
I thought you were some sort of nut.
Maybe I am. Take off.
Professional all the way.
We found the linen truck.
- The switch had already been made.
- How much did they get?
Property is totaling it up now.
Megabucks.
Must be $2 million wholesale, anyway.
Robbing the police. Man, that's beautiful.
Chief wants to see you at half past.
- Capt. Windott's on his way.
- I'll bet he is.
Sgt. Kennedy. Yeah. Let me have it.
Now, what the hell was that?
Just what the hell was that?
- You hot-dogging it around like that!
- I wasn't sure on my information...
You didn't have to be sure.
Your responsibility is to let us know.
My responsibility is to my client.
Nothing in the law
says I have to tell you anything.
Okay.
Then you better tell your client...
to find himself a new private.
Pending a look into that shootout,
there will be a delay...
in approval of Pinky's request
to take you on.
We're all set, Captain.
I'll search Santiago's place.
I'll cover his house, but even if he's got it,
he's not gonna have his stash there.
Ed, you've gotta help me
with something here.
Let's say for a minute McQ is right...
and Santiago needed the dope
to supply his people...
so he brought in this robbery team, right?
Now you tell me, how did he know
when state was gonna move it...
or how did he know
where it was gonna be burned?
Now,
I understand that's private information.
That's right. State sets the time and place.
- So somebody leaked it, right?
- Yes, somebody.
Ed, what about a connection...
between the robbery
and the murders of Boyle and the officers?
There's a connection, all right.
One of the officers shot was in Property...
Wally Johnson.
Frank, if there's a tie-in, we'll find it.
You're forgetting something. You're out.
And I wanna tell you something. I'm glad.
Just a minute, you still carrying?
Better leave it.
For the time being, your permit is revoked.
And if you give me any more
of your crap...
you will find employment of any kind
is just a little out of your reach.
If you want me to hit you harder,
I can do that, too.
Sir, Capt. Windott's here.
Hi, Phil. Get out.
- Ed, don't you think McQ here...
- Frank!
- Phil. How are you?
- Fine.
We've got a problem.
Franklin Toms, field deputy, city council.
- Capt. Windott.
- Frank.
Nice to meet you.
Let me know how the sweep comes out.
- I'll be going by Lois' house tonight.
- Okay, Lon.
- Hey, Lon.
- Jack.
- What are you doing?
- Buying a gun. This one.
Got a minute? I got something
I wanna show you in back.
Lon, I have a little equalizer here.
We're gonna try to sell it
to the department.
- The Ingram.
- Ingram?
- Nine millimeter.
- Six, seven pounds?
6.25. The silencer makes a nice handle.
Lon, this can here is filled with water.
Go on. Squeeze off a burst.
Why not?
How about that?
Those 32 slugs came out
in a second and a half.
Yeah.
Did you ever see anything like it?
You're not going to take it, are you?
Just say it's a loan.
Lon, it's not licensed!
Jack, neither am I.
I am going down to see my folks.
Why don't we get into that Green Hornet
of yours and go down together?
- I'd like to, but...
- I see.
Lon, why don't you catch on?
Police work can't be done these days.
Crime isn't just organized,
it's institutionalized.
Thanks.
- And you're blowing it, you know.
- What?
Your allotment, brother. You're off
the force. You won't get licensed.
You know, kid, you're empty.
Why don't you do something filling?
I wanna know who did it and why.
You'd think I would, too, wouldn't you?
Hello. Yes, he's still here.
- Hello.
- Lon, J.C. The search is over.
- What happened?
- What we figured. Zip.
Okay, J.C. Thanks.
Go on home.
- Nothing.
- Santiago doesn't have it.
He has it, all right.
He's probably driving it around town.
That's the standard procedure.
Now, what do you think
would be a safe place to stash it?
- Where the police have already been.
- I think you're right.
Do you have to leave?
- No big hurry.
- Refill?
Why not?
Lon, can I tell you something?
Stan and I were having trouble
for a long time.
We were in the same bed,
but it was just sleeping.
Did he say anything?
- Did he tell you I was leaving him?
- No.
I thought you two
knew everything about each other.
Everything and nothing.
I really don't want you as a brother.
I guess I never did.
That's the danger of the buddy system.
Maybe the manual needs rewriting.
- Maybe it does.
- Why not?
A couple of empties.
Like in the songs...
let's help each other through the night.
- Hi.
- Frank, come in.
- Frank?
- Hey, Lon. I didn't know you were here.
I'm glad you are. I need to talk
with both of you, as a matter of fact.
Sit down. Would you like a drink?
No. Yeah, I will. Give me a Scotch
and water, if you don't mind.
The commission asked me
to stop by, Lois...
to see if you needed anything,
if you wanted anything.
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Okay.
And about that job, I know
I can get you clerical work in accounting...
but if you can hold on
just a little bit longer...
I heard a better job
was gonna open in Public Affairs.
- Sounds good to me.
- Good.
I'm sorry about the hassle
they've been giving you downtown, Lon.
And I agree with you,
Ed's on the wrong track.
I mean, he's got this bug
about the militant angle, see.
There's gotta be more to it than that.
I'm gonna talk with him.
I'm gonna change his mind.
That would be a start.
But if I were you,
I'd cool it for a little while, anyway...
because it just seems to me
you're damned exposed.
Yeah.
Have you eaten? And you?
Let's all have dinner someplace.
I'd like that...
but I guess
it'll have to wait till another time.
Good night, Lois. See you tomorrow.
Just ease the gun out.
Make yourself comfortable.
I guess I was expected.
Breaking and entering. Very serious.
Robbery and possession of narcotics.
You're in more trouble than I.
We shall see.
Look.
I don't like what you did to me.
I suppose I can understand it...
the rage of a man who's lost a good friend.
But I don't like what you did to me.
I kind of enjoyed it myself.
You interrupted my coffee. Have some.
No, thanks.
Come on, now. Relax.
One spoonful or two?
Two.
It has been my observation
that policemen like their coffee sweet.
Sugar!
All of it. Sugar!
Where's the stolen sugar?
Do you understand what's happened?
A switch has taken place...
and where?
Where else but the police
department itself?
Actually, I find it quite charming.
I arrange a robbery...
a very difficult robbery.
Stealing from the police itself.
But before I can steal from them...
they steal from me.
My heart bleeds for you.
If you're bleeding, it's for yourself.
Your people are the violators.
Proof again of how unfair things are.
The advantage always lies
with the people on the inside.
Who?
You ask me?
How do I know?
I'm on the outside.
But big people, it would seem.
A big operation...
who else but big people?
How about Stan Boyle? Did you blast him?
I had no reason.
Possibly he discovered...
what was taking place.
Perhaps it's been going on for a long time.
Maybe everything that was ever burned
was sugar.
Now, I find that concept fascinating.
Certain officials...
are my competitors.
See what the world has become?
Well, I can't help you.
Then go.
I have nothing to fear from you.
All this will be destroyed...
and no one will know
of my embarrassment...
except those very clever officials.
Of course.
One more thing.
I don't see anything.
What'd he hit you with?
Powdered sugar. The hell with that, Pinky.
Let's get on with it.
Let's see what we can put together.
- There are two separate frolics here.
- That's right.
Santiago arranged the heist,
and he came up a loser.
Insiders pulled this job.
Wally Johnson stood
the morning watch alone.
It'd be easy for him
to slip out the dope and slip in the sugar.
His murder, Hyatt's, and Stan's
all connect.
And no militants mixed up in it, right?
Yeah.
And that makes you wonder, doesn't it...
why Kosterman was
so eager to stick them.
Yeah, doesn't it?
That's why I need you.
So you check IRS, his bank accounts...
any girlfriend he might have on the side.
You know the routine.
Kosterman. That's heavy.
- What are you gonna do?
- I've got my own angle.
He probably collected and stashed
that dope by now.
If it's not on the street already.
- Sgt. Davis.
- J.C.?
This is Lon.
-Can you talk? 
- Go.
Has a new supply of junk hit the streets?
Not a thing, Lon.
Let me know if it does.
Sure. What is it? What are you into?
Don't ask. Just answer. It's best that way.
McQ.
Coffee.
Go outside and bring the car
around front, baby.
We're not gonna be here much longer.
The air in here got foul.
Just go get the car, baby, and be cool.
What the hell is wrong with you, McQ,
coming here?
Don't get excited, Rosey.
I hear you're holding out on me.
What are you trying to do, man,
run me out of business?
Your stuff's coming down
from headquarters, some top brass.
What the hell are you talking about, McQ?
I get from Santiago. You know that.
I don't know anything about any cops,
either.
I think you do, and I wanna hear it.
- Okay, but not here.
- Here. Now.
You know what will happen to me
if I'm seen with you on my tail?
Man, I'll be out of business in a week.
Look, McQ, on the force or off,
you are bad news...
and if anybody was dirty,
you ought to know who.
What do you mean by that?
Boyle, your buddy. That's who.
Now, there's a cat
that smelled bad all the way.
Back that up, Rosey.
Give me something solid to support it.
Street talk.
The same way I get everything else
for you, street talk.
You ever bad-talk Boyle again...
I'll kill you.
Myra?
Hi.
I don't know if it's healthy
being seen with you.
I hear you're making a lot of people mad.
Sit down a minute.
You heard about the drug heist...
the hit on the state narco officers.
Yes, it's been all over the TV.
And there's a rumor...
that somebody down at headquarters
isn't clean.
I don't know anything about that.
You wouldn't be holding out on me, Myra?
- I'm a tired man.
- No.
I'm not dealing, Lon...
- But when you are rested...
- You know something?
You are attractive.
Sure.
That's all that a girl like me needs,
is a liar like you.
You sure you won't come in?
Thanks.
If you should change your mind,
you know where I'll be.
No. That's all right. Thank you.
Good night.
Just a minute, Lon, honey. I'm coming.
No.
Hello.
Lon, where the hell have you been?
I've been trying to reach you.
- What did Myra tell you?
- Nothing.
She didn't know a thing.
Somebody thought she did.
She's been killed.
Damn.
What the hell?
What the hell?
- Holy Jesus!
- Look at that.
Get some foam on this thing.
- Where are you?
- In the back.
How bad are you hurt?
How the hell do I know?
Get some foam on this thing.
I'm up to my butt in gas.
There's no fracture.
I don't see any other apparent injuries.
It may not be apparent,
but you ought to feel it from my side.
You've been banged up pretty good.
Watch this hammer.
Keep your head still.
I think we'll keep you here
overnight for observation.
Nurse, where is that head injury?
As they say, you're a lucky man.
- What's with the car?
- Totaled.
You're gonna need new wheels,
that's for sure.
It's time I got rid of it.
If it isn't being wrecked, it's being stolen.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Stay right here, Lieutenant,
I'll be with you in a minute.
Thank you, Nurse.
What do you think, Lon? Santiago?
No. He could have taken me
anytime he wanted.
The whole thing's weird.
Why press you in iron?
It's not so weird if they wanted
to separate me from that car.
- Where is it?
- Impound on Olive.
- Why?
- Just a thought.
Okay, I'll split.
If you need anything, I'll be at home.
- Say hello to Ellen.
- Right.
- What's this for?
- You.
No way.
Damn it, Lieutenant. We're busy
around here. I say you get in this chair.
- Hospital regulations.
- And I say it's damn ridiculous.
All right, Lieutenant,
but we're taking it up with us anyway.
I don't make the regulations.
You could be seriously injured
and not even know it.
- Maybe you're right.
- I've had other cases like you, though.
Just last week I had three.
Two of them were okay,
but one of them was...
Well, for Christ's sake.
Olive and 23rd.
Car 10 to radio.
Notify Capt. Kosterman
the subject just left the hospital.
All right, Lon, come on out. 
We know you're in there. 
Farrow.
Come over here.
What's going on?
What are you doing here?
I came to meet a friend.
What is going on?
Captain got an anonymous tip.
Lon's had the stolen dope in his car.
He's in there after it now.
- Lon?
- Why not?
Anyone can go bad.
Goodbye, Pinky, you're in the way.
Take him over there till I can get to him.
Come on, Lon, we know you're armed. 
Now, come out with your hands empty. 
Lon, we got a lot of firepower out here. 
Don't make me use any heat. 
All right, Lon, you coming out? 
Let's have the dog.
All right, bring him out.
Son of a bitch!
Lon, what happened?
The police were here looking for you
10 minutes ago.
- Where are you going?
- Down to see my folks.
All right. Get the car out.
Lon, what happened?
Come on, Lois.
All right, Lon. What happened?
Lon, for God's sake.
Stan was dirty.
I don't believe it.
I didn't want to, either.
He was in a frolic, all right...
to steal dope from the Property section...
and sell it off.
The dope had been switched for sugar
long before the heist.
It was stashed in my car.
I was hauling it around.
- What did Stan have to do with that?
- Everything.
I loaned him my car.
He said his was in the shop.
That's the way they got the dope in there.
You really mean it, don't you?
All the way.
I feel kind of silly...
acting like an avenging angel all that time.
I guess he thought a big crop
would bring me back to him.
I'm glad he's dead.
I'll tell you this, I'm on his side. Why not?
It's the new national sport called grabbing.
Everybody does it.
The senator sells privilege,
the judge takes bribes.
This time it just happened to be Stan.
And some others.
Who?
Somebody tall. Somebody in.
Somebody who killed
Wally Johnson and Stan...
so they could have more for themselves.
Kosterman?
- I'll find out.
- How?
Through you.
I feel kind of silly about that, too.
Lon, you're crazy.
That would be nice.
I'd like it better that way.
No, it started playing back to me, Lois...
when you kept saying:
"Let's get in your Green Hornet
and go someplace."
My car.
And not only once...
at least twice.
You were in it together,
but Stan got double-dealt.
You not only took him off your belly...
you took him out of this world.
You and your new partner.
You are crazy.
We'll see, Lois.
I'm gonna stick with you until...
we find out who comes for this junk.
That's right.
Your friend took it out of my car,
gave it to you...
to move it out of the city.
Now, let's see.
Is it in here?
Maybe it's in this one.
Then, it has to be in this one.
Lon, for God's sake,
there are $2 million there.
Lon, you like me.
I like you.
I can go anyplace. We can go together.
That turnoff up there...
take it.
McQ! He's behind the car!
Franklin Toms.
Servant of the people.
Santiago.
Can you hear me?
I want that junk.
McQ, are you listening?
I said, I want that junk!
What's your answer?
McQ, I'll purchase it from you.
25 cents on the dollar.
50 cents. Now, that's fair.
Come, now. Let's stop the nonsense...
shake hands on an agreement.
If you want it so damn bad,
come and get the stuff.
Get it.
Go on.
Too bad.
Okay, Lon, I had it wrong...
but I didn't turn in your badge.
I could tell you what you can do with it.
You...
Lon, it was my job.
I was transferred to Internal Security.
I've been on you all the way.
Yeah, it's your job.
Lousy damn junk.
All right, Lon, how about it?
There's a bar over there.
Let's get a drink.
