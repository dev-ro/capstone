Dad, come and eat!
Okay, let's see.
It tastes alright.
Then... since I made breakfast...
Can we please have sweet and sour chicken after mass is over.
I cooked the miso soup and your grandmother marinated the kimchi.
But I made the egg roll.
And I paid for the eggs that went into making it.
Why are we relating that to this?
I still took the time to cook it?
If I hadn't purchased the eggs,
could you have made the egg roll?
But I put in the effort to make it,
and it turned out well.
Do you know how difficult it was?
It's too salty! Way too salty!
Hey!
How can you cry so easily when you're a man?
Alright. I hear you, stop playing around.
Really? You can't break a promise!
Then you'll pray for me today during mass.
Loyalty! (soldier term [??] greeting to superior)
God loves each and every one of us.
As long as we pray
and our prayers are earnest,
God will hear us.
But sometimes the things we may pray
for cannot be easily realized.
So no matter what the circumstances,
Even when we are enduring hardships or suffering,
We can never give up hope.
Keep your faith in God
and continue praying,
Because one day, The Lord
will answer your prayers.
Two bowls of black bean noodles (jajangmyeon),
and two portions of sweet and sour pork.
Okay!
Dad?
Yes.
Dad, were you not praying?
Praying? When?
To save Mom.
I did pray.
Did you pray earnestly?
I did pray earnestly.
Then why didn't the Lord listen?
Although
I prayed earnestly to God to save your mother,
Your mother had also been praying to God
for you to be born happy and healthy.
Your Mother must have prayed much
more than I did,
Because God listened to her wishes.
Dad,
Cheer up!
Dad, will you come home very late today?
Yes, please go to sleep before then.
Routine inspection.
Please open the window... Hello?
Officer Choi!
Yeah?
Let me handle it.
If you don't open the window,
I'll have to break it.
Please blow into this.
Blow into this.
Sergeant Park! Sergeant Park!
My son! No! Why!
Dad!
Dad!
Are you okay?
My father is ill.
Is he very ill?
Yes.
If I pray,
God will save my Dad, right?
What is your name?
Park Yong Hoo.
If you pray earnestly,
God will surely hear.
Should we pray together?
Son,
Wake up!
Dad has something to tell you.
Listen carefully to what I'm saying
You have to listen to what
your grandmother’s says.
Try not to upset her in any way.
It doesn't matter to me
if you study badly.
Really?
Just be sure to be a good person.
If you see someone who is suffering,
you need to help them.
If you see someone who is hungry,
share your food with them.
And if you see someone
bullying the weak,
You have to teach them not to.
Right, Park Yong Hoo?
Dad, you're not leaving, are you?
Dad...
Will always be with you.
Dad, no, don’t go.
Dad!
Salute!
[indistinct talking]
You deceive people! Liar! Get out!
Leave right now!
Why would you come here?
My dad died because of you!
Deceitful, murderer, get out!
No, let me go!
Deceitful! Leave now!
Get out!
Get out!
And now, ladies and gentlemen!
The judges and the fighters are ready.
Los Angeles, California,
Make some noise!
If you are ready!
Introducing first,
fighting in the blue corner,
He's a freestyle fighter standing 5 feet, 11 inches,
Weighing officially 170 pounds,
10 wins and 3 losses in 13 games,
From Fort Worth, Texas, USA,
Here's the challenger,
The SUPER MARINE,
John White!
And his opponent across the cage,
fighting out of the red corner,
Attacker standing 6 feet one inch tall,
weighing in at 170 pounds,
With a record of 17 wins and no defeats,
Seoul, Korea, the world's No.
1 MFC *welterweight champion
(*between lightweight and middleweight),
The "Grim Reaper",
Park Yong Hoo!
Gentlemen, we've been over the rules,
protect yourself at all times!
Follow my instructions,
we're gonna have a clean fight.
Touch gloves and let's do this!
Will you just stand by this time?
Revenge. 
Hurry, revenge for Dad.
Revenge.
Revenge for Dad.
Revenge, Revenge.
Revenge.
Revenge. Go.
Are you ready?
Son, wake up!
Yong Hoo!
Dad?
Dad, wait a minute.
God killed Dad.
Revenge for Dad.
Revenge.
Yong Hoo, let's take revenge.
God killed Dad.
Revenge, Revenge.
Damn!
Hyungnim, are you okay?
Flight attendant, we need you!
As you can see the wound is inward,
It looks to have been done by something sharp.
This happened while he was sleeping on a plane.
He could have been stabbed while sleeping.
Don't worry, it should heal within a week.
He's taken the medication
as well as cleaned and disinfected it.
But it still will not stop bleeding.
We will need to do a thorough examination.
The concentration of smog in Seoul is now 228mg,
Which is about 7 times higher than the average.
Hyungnim, have I told you about my niece?
My niece is 15 years old this year.
One day, she began having trouble sleeping
because of nightmares. And she
began to claim that
she saw someone is standing
outside the window in her room.
She started losing her hair.
And one day, her eyes just turned black
and tears of blood began coming out.
My sister was so scared
and took my niece to dozens of hospitals.
They couldn't find out why
this was happening.
I met with my sister's friend,
who is a shaman.
When the shaman saw my niece,
they wanted to recruit her.
Recruit?
Yes!
They said that if she didn't accept within 10 days,
The gods will be angry and ruin my niece’s eyes.
No one believed it in the beginning.
But on the 10th day, we believed.
Her sight was gone.
So we rushed to accept the offer
and she began to regain strength.
Can she see now?
No, she cannot see like we do.
I heard that she can see ghosts.
She's at a shaman's house in Incheon.
If you want to see her, just let me know.
I will help you make an appointment.
I don't believe in that kind of thing.
Ah, okay.
If it were infected,
the results would have shown in the blood test.
But it all came back completely normal.
To be honest,
actually the results were better than normal.
Then why is it bleeding?
I'm sorry.
We can introduce you to a bigger hospital here.
But the results would still be the same.
Let's go see your niece.
Ah, okay.
It's in here.
I'll wait for you outside.
She's waiting for you.
Have a seat.
Damn!
You're screwed!
(slang)
There's a group of ghosts behind you.
Why?
Because of something malicious.
There will be so many fierce and evil souls
that will continue to stay with you.
You idiot!
I really don't understand any of this.
I can hear a voice.
Did you hear it?
Did you answer?
Revenge.
God killed Dad.
It's my voice.
If a ghost speaks using your voice...
Will you always listen to it?
The ghost imitated your voice to deceive you.
What is the shiny thing on your chest?
This is the ring my dad left for me.
Your dad is dead, isn't he?
How did he die?
He was a policeman
who died while trying to catch someone.
If people die while doing good deeds,
Their souls can protect those they care about.
That ring is full of love,
But what is this?
It gives off good energy, it's not evil.
What did you see?
A cross.
There is a cross on the south side of your house.
If you go there at midnight today,
There will be someone who can help you.
God, the Father in heaven.
All holy saints of God,
All holy angels and archangels,
God, the Holy Spirit,
All holy martyrs,
All holy bishops and confessors.
I command you in the name of God.
Tell me your name!
I command you in the name of the Holy Father, the Holy Spirit.
Show your true face!
Your teacher is in hell!
Father Kim,
Chapter 84.
Okay.
Our Father who art in Heaven,
All holy saints of God, Intercede for us.
By the sign of your name,
let your servants be protected in mind and body.
Holy Saints, Holy Saints, Holy Saints,
By the power of God,
I command you, to leave this body
and return to the hell
from which you came!
God...
Father!
God, please save me.
What are you looking at?
What the hell? Damn!
Excuse me!
What is this?
When did it start to become like this?
What is it?
It's a scar of the wounds that
Jesus suffered when crucified.
It's rare but every now and then
It appears on believers who are deeply
immersed in their faith.
We call it a Stigmata.
I don’t believe in that
shit, why is it happening to me?
I asked why it's happening to me?!
Just because I went to pray, I didn’t
even see my father’s last breath.
This priest is lying to you
like the last one.
Kill the priest.
Kill him, kill the priest!
He is lying to you, kill him.
Kill him, kill him.
Hurry and kill him!
Kill the priest! He's trying to deceive you!
Murderer.
Kill the priest.
Hurry kill him, kill him.
Damn!
Kill him, quickly kill him.
Kill him, kill him.
Kill him, kill him.
Holy Saints, Holy Saints, Holy Saints.
Kill the priest!
By the power of God,
Kill him!
In the name of the Father,
and the Son,
I command you, to leave this body
and return to the hell
from which you came.
God please punish evil
and bless the good.
Amen!
Are you okay?
Why do I always hear these voices?
If your home is not far away,
I can help you keep the voices
at bay for some time.
I promise you'll start to feel better.
Give me some time to pray.
If you start to hear voices again,
Come find me.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Father, I can't do this anymore.
I am sorry.
All tests that we are given
are for a reason.
Don't give up on your dream!
Thank you!
God!
Please God, hear my prayers.
Although my mind understands
the value of your tests,
I am afraid that my body and soul
may give out if I keep going on like this.
Please, I beg you, show me mercy.
You are...
Park Yong Hoo’s the boxer, right?
Wow!
I am your fan.
Can you please give me an autograph?
Yeah!
Is this new?
Yes. It’s new, but it’s okay.
It really doesn't matter.
Where is the priest that was here yesterday?
Which priest?
He's older...
and his eyes are large...
Oh, that priest is not from our church.
He came in from the Vatican.
Because the bishop asked,
I lent the church to him for a day.
I can give you the address of where he's staying.
Thank you!
One moment.
Bishop,
Although the exorcism was a success,
We did not catch the one who put the demon there.
The man who did this has a very evil soul.
I am sure that there is
a Dark Bishop in Seoul.
Welcome, Boss.
Have you eaten?
Yes, I have eaten.
How long has he been waiting?
Thirty minutes.
Has he said anything?
He said that if you didn't show up,
that he would start trouble.
Get back to work.
Yes, sir.
Last Friday, because of underage
drinking, the police were called.
If we were hired to do security,
We would handle it before the police
could be called.
We would prefer a 5-year contract
with payment of 30 million won per month
(roughly 25,500 USD).
Sometimes...
In a large, well-established business,
a fire can breakout.
If the fire starts at the entrance,
There is only one other exit that
the guests can get out safely from.
But what if that exit isn't open to them?
Why?
Because a bastard parked his truck
right in front of the door.
If you hire us as your security team,
we can stop the cause of the fire,
so that it doesn't get out of hand.
Boss.
Alright.
Write down your bank account number.
Sacred serpent,
I call upon thee.
You know Dae Hwan,
your business partner?
There's something he's been keeping from you,
that I would like you to know.
Dae Hwan’s gambling debt is more than 2 billion won.
All are usury loans with interest
he cannot afford.
But Dae Hwan will meet with some people
in Yeongdeungpo to sell the company.
Though, when he gets the money, he plans to
escape to Thailand - not pay back his debts.
If you don't believe me, you can call him.
He's meeting with them right now.
The person you are calling is n-
When he sells the company, it will
be in someone else's hands, not yours.
You should stop him before that happens.
You bastard, how do you know about this?
I know some people among the loan sharks.
If you're lying, I'll kill you.
Of course...
It’s bad to lie.
Get in, let's go!
Go back up.
Yes, sir.
Hyung,
Tell me the truth.
It wasn't me, I didn't do it.
It really wasn't me.
Hey, start it up.
I am dedicating the soul of this crime's victim to the Father.
Please give me strength.
My only angel,
Holy snake, please come to me.
Please give me the enemy's heart.
Sacred snake, I believe in your power.
Not me... not me.
It wasn't me!
I am offering the soul of this crime to the Father.
Please give me eternal life.
There are many people
in our parish today,
Including a mother of a daughter
that I would like you to go see.
The daughter is religious but hasn't
attended mass in a while.
She parties and drinks a lot now.
But when she's home, her mother says
that she talks to someone who isn't there.
Yesterday morning has been the worst so far.
Her mother opened her bedroom door
and went in to check on her.
She said that her daughter was on the ceiling.
I will go check it out.
But sir...
Is there a priest that can help me?
It isn't very easy to find one.
The current priests that we have
don't want to do such trivial things.
Before, Father Kim was the only volunteer.
Do you need something?
No.
This belonged to the Pope.
Put it in your bedroom.
What is it?
It is something blessed by God.
Can I use this?
This can only help you trust
that God will keep evil at bay.
The important thing is belief.
As long as there is belief,
there's nothing to be afraid of.
I don't believe in God.
Why?
When my dad died,
God did nothing.
The priest of a church that I went to at the time
Told me that If we prayed all night,
that God would answer our prayers.
But his words were all lies.
When the priest who taught me
how to perform exorcisms died,
I felt very confused.
I had trusted God all of my life,
and only ever did good deeds,
But then I began to question,
"Why did someone like him have to die
all alone?", and wondered if this was worth it.
Because it was too painful to deal with on my own,
I talked to the Pope about it.
The Pope said
"When we're young, we listen to our parents.
Not because we fully understand
the meaning of our parents.
But instead we listen,
Because they really love us
And we believe in their love for us.
God does not want us to understand why
or how he exists but to believe
in him because
God is our father
And will always love us.
All the pain we have experienced is for a reason.
We just have to believe in and follow him."
Sooner or later, I will understand
exactly what the Pope meant.
So what is the reason for the priest’s death?
I think it was meant to give me the motivation
to continue to do this job.
I have something to do now.
Are you sure I can have this?
It's not very expensive, is it?
It's something you cannot buy with money.
What can I do in return?
Consider it as a gift that God meant for you
to have in exchange for saving my life that night.
Get in.
Who was the person who ran out of the church?
Were you outside?
There were a lot of crows going crazy,
so I wasn't able to go in right away.
The crows left after he came out, so I went in.
Is that person not going with you this time?
No.
Let's do this together, then.
It can be done by one person.
The priest who gave you the rosary
wouldn't want you to die now.
If it is God's will.
Is suicide also the will of God?
Going in, it’s suicidal behaviour.
The last time you performed an
exorcism you almost died.
But I didn't. I'm alive.
That's because I went in and saved you.
It was God's will.
Fine, I won't go in with you.
That is also the will of God.
This old man really can't communicate.
Turn right here.
Thank you.
Your name is...?
Park Yong Hoo.
Mind if I wear this?
Where is Soo Jin now?
The devil will read our thoughts
and use them against us.
Be careful.
Wait a minute!
What is this?
A sign of the cross, drawn with
blessed chalk.
The devil can't pass this door.
Let me call you back.
Who are you?
I command you in the name of God,
Demon that has possessed this human.
Mom!
Tell me your name!
Mom!
Mom!
Jesus Christ commands you!
What is your name?
Jesus commands you!
What's your name?
Father,
You can't listen to what my mother says,
Because her illness is very serious.
It's a mental disorder.
She's always talking to herself at night
and says that we should die together.
Her face is covered in bruises
because she hits herself.
Last night, she began throwing out
the religious books we have
and even a Jesus statue.
Maybe she isn't possessed?
Why isn't it showing itself?
Each devil has different characteristics.
Occasionally, there will be a smart devil
that is able to fool us,
because it can hide deep in the body
of the one who it is possessing.
Although it can handle holy water
being thrown onto the body...
having it enter the body would be
unbearable for it.
So, what do we do?
Why? Why are you doing this?
Mom!
Lord of the sky,
Lord of the earth,
Lord of angels,
Lord of the Archangel,
Lord of the Holy Father,
Lord of the martyr,
I was sent by the guy who killed your dad.
Yong Hoo!
Die!
Yong Hoo, calm down, calm down.
Kill him, kill him!
Kill him, kill him!
Kill him, kill this person right now!
Calm down, Yong Hoo. Now.
Come to your senses.
Kill him, kill him!
Kill him now!
Yes, kill him.
Kill him!
Let me go.
Ah, damn it.
What are you looking for?
Is your back okay?
It's not bad.
How did she get like this?
Some priests will make
sacrifices to the devil.
We call them dark bishops.
They like tricking humans
and taking away their body and soul,
then they dedicate the sacrifices
to the devil.
I'm here to find the dark bishop.
This wound on my hand... Stigmata..
It is what you told me about, right?
From what I can tell... yes.
Those who have this gift
are able to help those who are suffering
and create miracles, such as expelling the devil.
But you... have successfully completed
an exorcism in front of me twice
without a prayer or anything like that.
Shouldn't this gift be for those who believe in God?
Because I don't believe in God.
Yong Hoo, it's not about if you believe in God or not.
Because what you have is a grudge
that you are holding against him.
So it's hard for you to turn to and believe in him.
Yong Hoo, you holding this grudge against him...
It shows that the heart is deeply convinced that he does exist
and that you are deeply dependent on him.
Though the trauma that your soul has been put through
may stay with you for a long time.
Although I do not personally know
the priest at the church that you
attended when you were young,
I believe that he did the best that he could.
I know.
But I truly believed the priest's words
at that time, so I
can't find it in me to forgive just yet.
Father,
Soo Jin is alert now.
Soo Jin, do you remember anything?
Have you met someone new recently
that you didn't know previously?
You have been drinking a lot lately with
a young man.
Is it not him?
Ma'am, please let me ask the questions.
Okay.
Maybe that person told you that
he really likes you and that he
would never harm you.
But that is not true.
He approached you in the first place
because he wanted something from you.
Do you know where I could find
this person now?
Mom!
It hurts!
The holy cross is a symbol of light to me.
Please let that holy light repel this darkness.
Evil serpent, go back to where you came from.
Do not try and tempt or persuade this woman any longer.
Evil spirit be weakened by the almighty God.
I command you, to leave this woman alone
and return to where you came from/
In the name of Jesus,
We pray.
Holy Saints, Holy Saints, Holy Saints,
Lord of the heavens,
I command you in the name of the
Holy Father and the Holy Spirit
and the son, our Lord Jesus Christ,
Leave this body and place.
May the blessing of almighty God,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
come upon you and remain with you forever.
Amen!
Please contact me if she needs
anymore help or wants to talk about him.
I am sorry.
I will try and persuade her to
talk to you.
Don’t persuade her, please be patient with her.
If she is meant to tell me about him, it will be God's will.
Okay.
Fighting with the devil really makes you hungry.
Am I right?
Let's go.
Delivery!
Oh, you're Park Yong Hoo..
I am a huge fan of yours.
Do you want me to sign something for you?
No, it's okay.
You can go.
Okay, please enjoy the food!
You seem to have a lot of fans.
When did you start boxing?
I've been boxing since I was young.
But I had a senior in the army
that was a professional boxer,
So I sort of followed in his footsteps.
You don't have anymore appetizers?
I had to go to the US this month for a match,
so I haven't had the chance to buy any food yet.
But can priests drink alcohol?
Yes.
We can smoke and drink.
I often drink red wine.
Drive the devil back to hell,
then have a glass of red wine
and you'll sleep very well.
I hardly drink alcohol.
How do you relieve stress?
I work out.
Boxing is considered a workout,
so isn't that what you normally do?
There's nothing else for me
that relieves stress.
Aren't you interested in falling in love?
My heart doesn't seem to be.
Because your heart is too stubborn.
I don't think this is something
a priest should be saying.
I can say it, because I have been a priest
for a very long time.
But you're still young, you have a lot
of various stages to go through.
I'll listen to all of your confessions.
With what happened a while ago,
What are your thoughts on it?
(the exorcism)
After seeing the scars on your back,
I thought that I would be beaten pretty badly.
I could have done it by myself but I
wanted to see how you would do.
You were hanging in the air.
At that time, I was trying to weight out
how strong our opponent was.
You looked like you were panicking.
I felt more confused than panicked.
I've been completely tricked.
Thank you for staying with me today.
Since you're here, you can say that prayer
and then head home.
The prayer you said before.
I'm drinking, so no.
I'm asking you to please say the prayer.
No.
This is unacceptable.
Why am I so thirsty today?
One more bottle...
You want me to get you another one?
You seem drunk already.
Yes, and this is why I can't pray.
Ah, it hurts.
It hurts!
Don't you dare try and tell the nuns about this!
Don't cry! You're not allowed to cry!
Come on, hurry!
Alright, alright!
What will we do if we get caught?
Don't worry about it. How will they
know unless he tells?
Hurry up, come on!
Ho Seok-ah, lift your head.
Who are you?
I am someone who is going to help you.
You've had a hard time, haven't you?
They aren't treating you like
this out of kindness...
They are bad guys, right?
It's okay, it's okay.
Hyung won’t let you suffer any more.
You believe me, right?
From now on, close your eyes
And repeat what hyung says, alright?
Holy serpent, please come to me.
Holy serpent, please come to me.
I am your humble servant.
Excuse me! Yong Hoo-sshi.
Who are you?
Do you remember me?
I'm the one who ran out of the church a few days ago.
I heard that you have a wound on your hand?
Look, I have it too.
It wasn't so bad at first.
But the more I used this power, the worse it became.
And the priest knows this.
But because he wants to use you,
he pretends like he doesn't know about this.
He will probably call you tomorrow
and ask for your help again.
Please, don't be like me.
Please.
Father
is the devil.
Our father in heaven
hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom comes,
your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Father,
A boy is showing signs of being possessed
here at the orphanage in Paju.
The nuns are currently praying.
Okay, I'll head over there now.
This will become the world's largest MMA corporation.
We have 7 trillion won of Chinese investment.
After 16 years of hard work,
do you know how much that is in USD?
Let me tell you. It's 5 billion US dollars.
Two companies in the US are fighting to partner with us.
God.
Please Lord watch over us.
May God protect this child and us
while wrestling with the devil.
Why won't you shut up?
Please don't let the power of the devil overtake us.
You still won't shut up? Damn you!
Please God punish the devil
but please do not blame the child
that the devil has taken hold of.
Please do not punish us who are
trying to protect this child.
Lord, watch over us.
May God protect this child and us.
Stop!
Please don't let the power of the devil overtake us.
Amen!
Amen!
Hello, Sister Angela.
Please God punish the devil.
Your fear is eating away at you.
Please do not blame the child
that the devil has taken hold of.
But don't pretend to be good and kind, it's disgusting.
When you act this way,
it makes me want to kill you.
With the power of Jesus Christ, I command you!
Tell me your name!
Say your name!
Hail Mary, Full of Grace,
The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now,
and at the hour of our death.
I command you in the name of the Holy Father and the Holy Spirit.
Tell me your name!
Cardema!
I command you to leave this body at once
in the name of the Father and the Holy Spirit
Leave this place!
Yong Hoo,
Compared to the reward you received from
your match with John White,
If you sign with us, I'll make sure
that you will earn ten times more than that.
During our live launch event
I'll make you the main player.
Let's give it a try?
Everything is okay now.
Sister!
Who are you?
We are an army.
How many are there of you in there?
666 brethren all together.
This won't work.
Why? What happened?
What if I offer you more money?
Hello?
Is Father Ahn not there?
Father Ahn and one of our sisters
are in the basement with the demon.
Where are you?
Sister!
He who flung you headlong from the
heights of heaven into the depths of hell,
It is He who commands you.
He who once stilled the sea and the wind and the storm,
It is He who commands you.
Hearken, therefore, and tremble in fear, Satan, you enemy of the faith,
you foe of the human race.
Why, do you stand and resist, knowing as you must that Christ the Lord brings your plans to nothing?
It is He who commands you to answer me!
What is your name?
Hadola!
I am expelling you in the name of the Holy Father
and the Holy Spirit.
Father!
Sister, you should leave, it's dangerous in here.
Go, hurry!
How can I leave you alone
with the demon?
I am not alone,
God is with me.
No. Go, hurry!
I also want to be with you.
In the name of the everlasting God,
Of the true God...
Dear God...
Dear God,
Please save me from my enemy.
From this bloodthirsty devil,
Help me!
Lord, please be my shield.
You... it's time to leave.
Are you okay?
Father Ahn!
Father Ahn!
Are you okay?
My face hurts a lot.
Are you admitting to not being very resilient?
That kid can really pack a punch.
Sorry, I am late.
Ho Seok, try to think back...
Have any strangers talked to you?
He said that he met a priest in his dream.
And that his Roman collar was black.
Do you happen to remember his appearance?
We sincerely thank you for saving our children.
You are welcome.
Go on and give your thanks to him.
Thank you, thank you!
I used to be angry when I saw the cross.
I would always avoid it.
Today, I saw the waiter wearing a cross bracelet on her wrist.
It’s weird, I wasn't angry, instead I thought of you.
Think you've changed me.
I believe in you.
This is an opportunity for you to
tell me that you believe in God.
Ha, don't get ahead of yourself.
Although I do not fully understand God's plan for you.
God does seem to trust you,
Even if you have a terrible temper.
I believe that you can use that drive
to help the weak,
Which is why I believe that God gave
you this ability.
Yeah. That sounds right.
Did you just talk to yourself?
Your father must have been a good
and just person while living.
What makes you think that?
Such a father had a son,
who he taught to do good deeds.
That makes both of you messengers of God.
Your father must be in heaven.
I really want to hug him again,
So that I can have no regrets in this lifetime.
Ho Seok-ah!
Ho Seok-ah, wake up!
I sacrifice this pure soul to the father.
Please, give me strength.
Sacred serpent, come to me.
Hello?
Father,
Ho Seok, he...
Ho Seok...
Ho Seok is dead.
Father Ahn, the child is inside.
Please give us some time, I want to pray for him.
That bastard.
Yong Hoo!
Help me, Father Ahn!
Father Ahn, save me.
Father,
I feel very sad.
Father,
You abandoned me.
You didn't save me.
Father, I am very hurt.
My neck hurts so much,
And I'm cold and scared.
Father Ahn, help me.
Father Ahn, hug me.
Hug me, please.
Father.
Father.
I'm sorry.
Father.
He's a slowly dying human, why do you
like him so much?
I really don't understand it. Huh?
I can not only keep your precious priest alive,
but I can also cure the wound on your hand for you.
All you have to do is raise your right hand
And say that you reject the father, the son and the holy spirit.
No, don't do it!
You might want to hurry...
Otherwise, our priest will be on his way to heaven.
I...
reject
the father,
God, please
protect Yong Hoo.
the son...
Mouthed: Damn it!
How... What... what should I do?
I... please tell me what to do.
Father Kim...
Father Ahn!
Father Ahn!
Third floor, bring him to the third floor.
Our Father
who are in heaven, hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earh as it is in heaven.
Why aren't you doing anything?
Innocent people are dying, so why?
When my father...
You also did nothing when he died.
The old priest trusts you with his whole heart,
So why? Why aren't you doing anything? Why?
Forget it.
I'll handle it.
Are you awake?
It's going to be okay,
I'm going to fix this.
You rest.
Soo Jin...
Please continue to pray for him.
Okay.
Brother,
This is what Father Ahn gave me.
I would like it if you could wear it.
This is an item that the Pope blessed himself.
In the future, when fighting the devil,
It will act as a sort of armour
and protect you.
Thank you!
May God be with you.
I don't believe in God.
If you protect your dark bishop,
Father Ahn and many other lives will be in danger.
Tell me where he is.
I asked you where that bastard is?
Come out you bastard!
But... I'll die if I give you my heart.
Damn!
Dad.
My son, you've grown up.
Dad.
Dad, I've missed you so much.
I'm sorry, son.
You have done well.
I miss you.
I will always be with you.
Ah! Damn!
Thank you.
As always, I am grateful to you, Father Kim.
I have arrived safely in Rome.
And am enjoying eating ice cream.
I wish you were here too.
I have and will always believe
that you will become a good exorcist.
May the Lord’s blessings and graces be with you forever.
No matter what, hold onto your faith.
Do not allow it to waver.
