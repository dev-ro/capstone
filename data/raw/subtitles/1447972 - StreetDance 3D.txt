Ever since I was a young girl...
... you'd find me up in my room
dancing in front of the mirror.
Carly and her street dance crew,
smashing it on some stage...
the crowd going wild.
It kept me going after
I left home.
I came to London where
street dance led me to my new family.
My crew.
I'm still dancing and dreaming
in front of that mirror.
It's just now...
I share my dream.
We're going to be late, man.
Hello? Guys!
We're halfway to New York.
If we dance like that in the finals
who is going to beat us?
Final call for The Surge.
Guys.
- Damn they're good.
- That's why they're champions, Carly.
Guys? Show some class.
- Are you going to get the drinks in, then?
- Maybe.
Jay-2-0, the next UK champions!
I love you.
Your round, Mac!
Guys!
Guys!
Okay, this is... this is the
hardest thing I've ever had to do.
I'm going.
- I wanted to end it on a high.
- Yeah, good one, Jay.
I'm serious. I'm under a lot of
pressure right now...
...at work and Uni...
something's got to give,
and it's got to be this.
- So, what are you saying?
- Jay?
We've all got pressures, bruv...
we've got a chance to be
UK champions...
...go to New York and
represent our country.
And I wouldn't do this
if I didn't think you could handle it.
But, you can.
Carly knows all the choreo,
she can take it from here.
- Can't we just talk about it?
- I've made up my mind.
It's your crew now.
I'm gonna miss you guys.
Come on, man.
This is some joke, t'ing.
I'm going to sort it, alright?
- You're not going to change my mind.
- What's wrong, Jay?
I thought you wanted to win?
Be UK Champions!
Sometimes you've got
to make choices.
Why didn't you tell me?
I looked like such an idiot.
I need to get my head straight.
Have a bit of a time out.
Well, have a week off
and come back.
I mean from everything...
everyone.
- I need to get rid of distractions for a bit.
- Thanks, and I'm a distraction?
The biggest.
- Is it because I said I love you?
- No! It's just a time out.
If you take over the crew,
you won't even notice I'm gone.
Okay?
One jacket, with cheese.
Enjoy!
- He said it was just a time out.
- Oh, cut and run, Carls.
He's ditched us all five weeks
before the finals!
I can take Jay's place
in the crew...
...as your man.
- Yeah, right, Eddie.
Keep practicing!
Let's just concentrate on winning
the streetdance finals, yeah?
Yeah, you're right...
...and then he'll want me back,
won't he?
Blonde and northern.
Tragic, really.
Thanks, Eddie...
Let's get down to rehearsals.
Offer still stands, Carly.
Why me? Shouldn't you be
running the crew Shawna?
- I just dance. You see the bigger picture.
- Will they listen to me?
Not if you sound like that.
You've got to be kick-arse Carly, man.
Come on, give me some heat...
Is that all you got?
Allez. Go into the centre.
I don't get it.
He's lost his family, rude boy.
How can we be Jay-2-0 without Jay?
It don't make no sense.
- Why are they stood outside?
- Just march in and show no fear.
Come on, give me some heat.
Give me some.
Come on.
That was lame.
Kick arse Carly, or kissarse?
Come on guys let's get started.
- Okay, guys, slight hitch.
- You didn't book the rehearsal space.
- Was I meant to?
- Come on, Carly.
You were the boss, right?
If you want to lead,
Frankie, be my guest.
Without Jay,
it's a waste of time.
- Steph, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
- We're supposed to be a crew.
- Don't worry. They'll be back.
Guys... I... can replace them.
- Come on, Eddie.
- You got to learn from the Da Boogie Man.
Listen, guys,
I don't know how to do this yet.
But what I do know is
we have got a heavy crew.
We've got a final in September.
Can't we just find somewhere to
rehearse and get on with it?
Show Jay what we're made of.
Fix up, man!
My hair!
- Oh, Shawna!
- Sorry.
- Gosh, man.
- Alright, Aimee.
- I think I've got hypothermia.
- You're so extra.
- We're supposed to dance outside.
- Not in England.
- America, maybe.
- Then, let's get there...
...but we've gotta be
UK Champions first.
Only if we rehearse in a studio.
Health and Safety, innit?
But we need money.
Have you got any?
Don't get rude, Carly.
If you let us use your studio for free
we'll wear T-shirts advertising your gym.
Hello?
- Bill for your little party last night.
- You what?
You wanna keep your job?
This ain't a drop-in-centre
for you and your mates.
- We only had a few Kit-kats.
- And?
I need every penny
I've got for dance space.
And?
Well, why don't you sponsor us?
Now, that is funny.
Right, off your butt, twinkle toes.
Eddie's late, so...
...you deliver these and I'll
think about letting your off the bill.
With a smile, Carly. With a smile.
That's better.
- Are you the sandwich girl?
- Yeah, is it a chicken salad?
- That's me.
- And one drink...
That's Â£5.50, please.
You're welcome to stay and watch,
if you like.
No, you're alright.
I was looking more
at your room, actually.
- That doesn't say much for my dancers.
- No, they're very good.
They're not really feeling it though,
are they? They look bored stiff.
Why are you interested in the room?
I need somewhere to rehearse
for my street dance crew.
I don't suppose you rent these rooms
for a fiver, do you?
- Are you any good?
- God, yeah.
Got the UK finals in a few weeks.
We'd blow this lot out of the water.
Okay. I'd like to see it.
- Yeah, right.
- Really.
Well, we're dancing in the shopping
centre tonight, if you do mean it.
- Sevenish.
- If I can get away, I'll come.
Really?
How will I find you?
Follow the crowds.
You are Romeo and Juliet.
You could die for each other.
Could I please get
an inkling of this.
- You need a permit!
- It's our money, we've earnt it.
Ain't that your Justine?
You big, ugly bear...
Justine, you come here.
Is this what you're coming here to do?
Shaming me like this.
- Do you want to get the police involved?
- But, it's ours.
- Cool it, Carls!
- Thanks!
- Everyone in Topshop's watching us.
- So, why didn't you help me?
No, you know what? I don't want to
be a part of this anymore.
- Don't you dare flake out, Aimee.
- Flake out of what?
We're going nowhere with you.
Without Jay, this crew's got no chance.
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
You whinge better than
you dance, anyway.
Come on, out! It's all done.
Finished! On your bikes.
On your way. Get your hair done.
You might want to refine some of
those management skills of yours.
Oh, piss off!
Well, whilst you're
in this mood, I will.
Come on.
A little chaotic... but good.
Vibrant.
Come and see me tomorrow
with the rest of your group...
when you find them.
Studio Three, four o'clock.
- Hello?
- Hi...
You shameful girl.
My Justine not dance
with you again.
And then there were two...
I've messed up, haven't I?
Changement, changement,
en force.
Open les bras.
Epaulemnt Allez.
Spot, spot, spot, spot.
Well, would we pay to see
this year's crop?
On present showing none shall
get through the Royal Ballet auditions.
Well, that's not going to dazzle
our benefactors, is it?
What's happened?
More and more I wonder
about our methods.
We drill the passion out of them.
The vital ingredient.
But, I have a plan to drill it back in.
It had better work, Helena.
Funding cuts mean other cuts,
you know?
Today it's all no good.
Carly, Shawna!
Oh, my God, it's you guys!
Oh, excuse me... no, thank you.
Mac!
- You pulled it off, Carly, man.
- Yeah, this place is nice.
Sick, man!
- Can I help you?
- Look at this bronx arse joke, brer.
We were told to be here
by this lady.
It's Helena.
- Have you come to watch us?
- Other way round, more like.
Get this one.
'Have I come to watch them'.
Not in those tights.
- Crap!
- Oh, man!
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I just need to lie here a bit.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
We'll pay for the damage.
I see you've made yourself at home,
but you're in the wrong room.
Hurry up, girls.
- Would this suit your needs?
- Are you kidding?
- This is amazing.
- And you've met my dancers?
- Kind of.
- Gabe, Isabella, Bex...
...Chloe and Tomas.
I have a proposition for you.
Unlimited access to rehearse here
for your competition.
Nice...
If you include my dancers
in your routine.
What?
- No way, we're a street dance crew, it's...
- No, say, no.
It's like a family,
we can't just take on new people.
Say something to her!
- Helena, with all due respect...
- Thank you, Tomas.
I decide the content
for your final master class.
Sorry, Miss, this sounds crazy.
- I'm sorry, I don't know your name.
- Carly.
Carly, if you don't take my dancers,
I'll have to charge you
for the hire of the studio and,
of course, for damages.
It's your decision.
Where are we going to
get the money from, man?
- We can't win the finals with them!
- I say we do a runner.
Guys, are you blind?
Bendy chicks, come on.
- Can they street dance?
- No, you'll have to teach them.
I'm sorry, her teach us?
Yeah.
This is a unique opportunity.
I hope you'll all embrace it and
perform well for the competition.
- I'm getting my dad to call the Board.
- Look at the state of them.
Like clowns.
Let's just have a go.
They'll be crap.
Then we can have the studio, anyway,
and we can get the others back.
Bruv, it's all green.
Where's the real food, man?
How's learning with those clowns
going to get us into the Royal Ballet?
Helena's known for
her unconventional methods.
We've just got to trust her.
What is street dance?
Oh, don't be a bun head
all your life, Bex.
Hey, this is Jay,
you know what to do.
Hi, Jay. It's me Carly...
...give me a ring back
when you can, please.
If you want, or...
if you can, whatever...
Did I say it's me?
It's Carly.
Focus, focus!
Plus fort, plus fort!
Right, it's your turn.
We've got five weeks and
that's what we need you to do.
Yeah, do we have to be so... angry?
That's just the way it is,
ballet boy.
- What are they?
- My feet?
That's not suitable.
Where are your trainers?
You know that trainers are
rule number one.
This is what we dance in.
Do you want us to injure ourselves?
Surprised you don't do that
in your tights, mate.
Do I pass?
Just trainers tomorrow, yeah?
Tap, one, tap, one... and again,
...five, six, seven, eight.
Tap one, tap one, tap one.
Let's try it to the music and
follow us if you lose the steps.
- What steps?
- Has she even heard of words?
All those girls are going to need
some hands on help from the Mac Daddy.
Can't you just calm yourself.
Look at them. They might snap, man.
Five, six, seven, eight...
Come on! You're going to be up against the
best street dancers in the UK in a few weeks...
Five, six, seven, eight...
You're going to make us
look like jokers!
Not good enough. Focus, please.
Five, six, seven, eight...
Carly!
- What did you say to her?
- I didn't say anything...
- You lot are bad, man.
- This is your fault, you know?
- Ours?
- Yeah.
- Carly.
- I can't do it.
- How was rehearsal?
- We're too different.
I can't do it.
- Can't or won't?
- Listen, I'm not a teacher, Miss...
Listen, I'm not a teacher, Miss, and I
think you've got the wrong idea about me.
Then that will be Â£ 250
for the hole in the wall.
Come on, I'm trying to tell you
this crew is going to fail.
Because you think it will,
or because you want it to?
Will you stop answering me with
questions. I don't want to lead this thing.
They're never going to
get it by the 27th!
Then I'll see you again
when you deliver my lunch.
But, go easy on
the mayonnaise next time.
I feel like a chav.
These things wreak havoc
on one's lines.
- I feel more comfy.
- Hey, guys.
More of them!
- Steph, Frankie!
- You're not doing the finals without us.
- Shawna, tell them what's going on.
- What's going on, B?
We got off on the wrong foot yesterday.
So, let's start again.
Street dance for beginners.
Spread out.
Just move like you are in a club.
This should swing it
for the Royal Ballet...
Just slouch a bit.
Do your own thing.
- We don't do slouching, darling.
- So, improvise.
You know that's
how street dance started.
In the streets, in the clubs.
Ripping up the rules.
We're going to break it down
for you...
Like Brook... locking...
Mac... popping...
Steph... breaking...
Come on, Boogie.
Steph, show them your house.
Frankie, new style.
Come on, Shawna. New style.
Finally, Mac. Krumping.
Come on. Pick a move
and get practicing.
Young man, what are you doing?
Delivering.
Helene, can you please
control your street people?
Dancers, Madame. Dancers.
That is a matter of opinion.
- Chicken salad?
- Thank you, Eddie. How's it going?
It's painful, Miss.
You know it might make life easier
if you let me run the classes with you.
Are you trying to tell me
how to do this?
Well, you could do
with the help, couldn't you?
We're doing a street dance...
not a ballet.
So much for ripping up the rules.
- He loves himself.
- Just your type.
- What? It's one way of forgetting Jay.
- I don't want to forget him.
Well, I think the
ballet boys are buff.
We're the teachers.
I'm getting my parents to
call Mr. Harding.
I mean, they're not paying
for disco dancing.
- Dairy's deathly, you know?
- It's alright. It's okay.
Survival has arrived.
- That's my lunch.
- Don't make me laugh.
Look, they can't dance our way
without the proper fuel.
Can't dance? Did you just say
that we can't dance?
That ain't dancing.
That's just flapping about.
Well, at least I don't look like
I'm having a seizure.
Whatever you say, tutu tits.
Tutu what?
You heard.
Food fight!
Discipline. Etiquette. Grace.
A few words I'd like to remind you of.
This is not how we treat our guests.
I can only assume you know what you're
doing bringing these characters in here?
You should be pleased,
Mr. Harding.
Our students are finally
showing some spirit.
Well, I'd rather see it
in their dancing.
You've got to find a way to
work together.
Get out of here.
Have some fun.
Get to know each other.
After youÂve cleaned up this mess,
of course.
Let's ditch them
when the track stops.
Yeah. We've made the effort.
Shawna!
Looks like you're stuck with us.
Come on.
- Carly!
- Aaron, are you alright?
- Are you on?
- We're up next. You been cool, yeah?
- I heard there was a bust up with Jay?
- No, we're just having time out.
- Is this your new crew?
- It's a long story.
Hang around and tell me later.
We'll get a drink or something?
- I will do. Good luck.
- Right, see you later.
Okay, you lot,
you've got to watch these.
These were the UK Street Dance
champions two years ago.
They're the best.
We used to have classes with them.
So this...
this is what we're aiming for.
Who's Jay?
- What's that mumbo jumbo you're writing?
- It's choreography for our routine.
You've got steps,
formations, feelings.
- What, and you're doing that?
- Yeah.
You are actually doing that?
I don't think making sandwiches
is my calling in life.
You've got that right.
Justine, concentrate!
Five, six, seven, eight.
Faster!
Looser.
Okay.
Glimmers of hope, Miss.
Tomas, relax a bit, please.
You're forcing it.
Go back to where you started...
...and try doing it not pointing your toes.
It looks a bit too pretty.
One and two and three and four...
Okay, I'm going to pick it up
from this section, please.
Now, Isabella, I want you to try it
with more attitude.
Five, six, seven,
eight and one, two...
Stop there, please.
Straight away, just slouch over.
Don't make it so upright.
No, no, no, you're not getting it!
Your arms are too flouncy and ballet.
Hands upright. Tight.
You should be able to do that, yeah?
What did I say?
Come on.
We don't have time for this.
Oh, how sad.
Crying over a street dance.
Oh, bite it, Chloe.
- Listen, I'm sorry if I was a cow back there.
- Carly, it's not you.
Do you know...
all my life I've been told to stand up
straight, turn out posture, and now...
Now, they tell me I look wrong.
They say I've grown too tall.
They won't even put me up for
the Royal Ballet auditions.
Come on.
I just... I don't know
where I fit in any more.
Forget them, babes.
You're with us now.
I feel bad.
Your students really
put themselves through it.
They're nothing if not hard workers.
But, they really want to do ballet.
Making them do something else?
I don't understand it.
- Have you ever been to a ballet?
- What do you think?
- Would you like to accompany me?
- I don't know. It's not really my scene.
How do you know...
if you've never been?
Maybe she fancies you.
- Get out.
- You never know with them arty-farty types.
Jay's a fool, you know that, right?
He's never going to call, is he?
- Nope.
- Never in a million years.
Thanks.
- You don't need him, anyway.
- It's all about Jay, though.
Stop putting yourself through it.
Tell you what...
- What are you doing?
- You call him.
- Have you dialled?
- It's on speaker. I want to hear.
Shawna!
Yeah, this is Jay.
You know what to do.
Jay, it's Carly.
I know it's over with me and the crew
and everything, I just wish you'd of said...
Just wish you'd said,
'you're dumped, muppet'.
Carly's taking us
all the way to the finals
with her new ballet boyfriend...
So, go suck on that
'time out', alright?
You tell him, rude girl.
That part of your life is now over.
It's time for the next phase.
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.
Are you some kind of
ballet celebrity?
I used to dance.
- Helena, darling.
- Oh, Michael.
I'm so pleased you could make it.
I wouldn't miss it for the world...
you know that.
Michael, this is Carly.
An exciting young choreographer
who is working with my students.
And this is Michael who is
choreographing tonight's ballet.
I'd love to see some of your work.
Oh, we'll see if
that can be arranged.
Well, enjoy the performance.
You're in every scene.
- He's just an old student of mine.
- Oh, yeah.
What did you teach him, exactly?
I got goose bumps, like.
Oh, gosh...
they never even said a word.
But you understood?
Not everything,
but it was powerful.
- I could feel what they were feeling.
- Good.
- Remember that for your routine.
- But, that's ballet.
Think less, 'this is ballet',
'this is street dance'...
...but more, 'this is dance'.
But, we're still entering
a street dance competition.
I mean, it's a different world.
Same world.
You'll have a stage
and an audience.
What do you want them to feel?
- Jay.
- I got your message.
It was Shawna, she's mad at you.
I'm sorry I didn't call you back
the other day.
You said you needed time out.
- I've missed you.
- Really?
Of course.
Look at you, where have you been?
You look amazing.
You wouldn't believe.
Do you want to ask me in?
Tell me about it.
Sorry.
It's me who should be apologising.
What will your
ballet boyfriend think?
Probably pirouette you to death,
if he existed.
You know I've been waiting for you.
- And you're still going for the finals?
- Gonna try.
Are the ballet dancers any good?
Really good.
Problem is trying to get them
to dance like us.
- You know there's still a place for you?
- It sounds like you're managing just fine.
One minute I think
we're doing good...
...then I think of 'The Surge'
and we don't even come close.
- Not everyone can be a winner.
- Well, thanks.
But... you've got to do your best.
Oi! Fred and Ginger,
there is a queue.
Why now? I don't get it.
He said it was a time-out
and he meant it.
Besides which...
I'm a sex goddess.
He couldn't stay away.
Oh, yeah... forgot that.
