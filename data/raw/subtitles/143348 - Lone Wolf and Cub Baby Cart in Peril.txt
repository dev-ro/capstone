Yuki, In the name of our Lord
we will execute you.
Please, kill Oyuki.
For Assassinations I
charge 500 Ryo.
KOZURE OKAMl
The lone wolf with cub
The heart of a child is
like the heart of it's parents
Directed by: Buichi Saito
While tattooing...
You have to press the skin tightly
with your thumb.
In the process of engraving
colour get's underneath the skin.
The noise that this creates is
called ''Sound of the distance''.
It's beautiful when you got
used to it,
But those who don't know it
usually shudder.
"Shuddering" ...
Because of the tattoo colour you
easily feel cold in winter.
Therefore you have to wear
warm clothes.
This doesn't mean it's more 
comfortable in summer though.
Wearing a tattoo means to train 
patience your whole life long.
She was one of the most wonderful
creatures I've ever seen.
I never touched a skin as smooth
as hers.
If you spend your life tattooing,
you get addicted to skin.
She was perfect.
A woman that stirred your blood.
Her face must have been beautiful
either, but ...
Did she cover her face?
Yes.
She stood over there ...
graceful
She wanted me to tattoo her with
something that would scare others
simply away. Stun them
Hearts should stop beating when
they saw it...
or something that should men 
totally loose control.
She let me touch her everywhere ...
Her back, her wonderful ...
breasts.
I did the mountain-witch on her back
On her breast I tattooed Kintaro, 
the witch's child, catching her breast
It's almost impossible to stand the
pain tattooing nipples and belly.
It is the worst torture imaginable.
But she was brave.
Didn't make any noise. No tears.
I had a suspicion.
First I thought she'd be a dancer
But that was wrong.
She had to be a fighter.
I heard the Lords have female
warriors: the Besshikime.
The way she looked and acted seemed
very much like a Besshikime.
Probably that's why she had to
cover her face.
But why does a Besshikime want
a tattoo of a witch and her child
covering her body
What could be the reason?
In fact it was my masterpiece, but
I sometimes question myself if...
it brings misfortune.
Who are you? who is he?
Who is he? Who are you?
Are you the god of
wealthiness?
Who sits besides him?
- the one with the long head!
Who are you? The god of welfare
and health?
And the Master besides you?
The one with the big belly?
The god of cheerfullness.
And the one right besides?
Who is the one with the
running nose??
Must be the god of a long life ...
Happy new year!
Children, go home!
It's all over, go!
Daigoro?
Daigoro?
Oh, where are you going, Myladies?
Oh? He, little boy.
We're going home.
It's all over now and soon
it'll be dark.
Better return home before!
- before monsters catch you.
Wandering monks
Dad.
Rain keeps falling.
like a long wet courtain.
It's cold. Cold and sad.
The wind blows in the
heart of the little boy.
Waiting for his father,
who won't return.
His father is supposed to be
an Assassin
The little boy knew that his 
father sometimes spent the nights
in abandoned temples.
He knew,
his father kneed before the statue 
of Buddha after his work was done.
He didn't know why. Did he go there
to talk with his mother who lived
in the other world now?
To cure his heart from the pain?
He was looking for his father
These eyes
A fighter living on the edge.
of life and death.
Only those who fought their 
battles know this look
How can such a young boy posess
the look?
Has my eyes turned blunt?
Attention! Pay attention on the
direction of the wind! - Yes.
For the next harvest.
- Yes.
Let's burn the field!
He'll be surrounded by fire.
I can't stand it!
But it is for sure a good
opportunity to test him.
I was right.
Despite the fire he doesn't cry
for help.
Still a child ...
but determined to live ...
What an amazing child ...
Come on over!
What's up?
A child? - It was surrounded
by the fire. We have to help him.
Hold on!
Is he hurt? - He hid in the mud,
so the fire didn't hurt him.
We'll have to hurry,
otherwise ...
He saved himself?
Yes, he was lucky.
You didn't cry for help because, you
thought you were saved.
That's why you weren't scared?!
Drop him!
What are you doing. Why do you 
raise your sword against a child?
His eyes ...
It's Shishogan the look of
a Fighter,
who killed hundreds, but did
survive...
I can't explain it ...
Impossible ...
Even the sword doesn't scare him.
Everybody who choses the way of
a fighter is longing...
to be like him
On the edge between life and death.
- What are you doing?
l'll have to be sure.
- How ...?
Fight!
- What?!
Away!
Or I'll kill you too!
Suio-Style, Ross-technique!!
Are you the child of 
the lone wolf?
Dad.
ltto Ogami ...
Dad.
Gunbei Yagyu.
You're still alive.
I defeated you.
The Yagyu-Shinkage-Style
defeated the Suio-Style.
Nevertheless you had been chosen
as the official Kaishakunin.
Those days ...
The Tokugawa-Shogunat
controlled their Lords
through a merciless Policy.
The Kaishakunin were those
who beheaded the Lords,
who were ordered to commit
Seppuku.
The Kaishakunin was allowed to 
wear the colours of the Shogunat.
This is how the Shogunat gave him
the power,
to behead lords in the name of
the Shogunate
Fool!
Get Gunbei!
The honor and future of the house
of Yagyu is in danger.
Fool!
ltto Ogami will be Kaishakunin
of the Shogunate.
Unbelievable! - How could you
raise your sword against the
Shogun. And Itto moved between
you and him, showing he'd
risk his life for the sake of
the Shogunate.
At least it looked like that,
but ltto had had no Chance to dogde
my strike. That's how it happened.
You idiot!
Even if it wasn't Itto's
intention, at least it looked,
as if he had protected the Shogun
Shogun from your blade.
Get up, Gunbei!
Gunbei!
Thanks to your skills I'll let
you live.
But from now on you'll be known
to be a dead man.
People will think you committed
Seppuku.
You'll change your looks
and you will go to the north.
Call Goroza, the one who can change
faces from the  Kurokuwa-Clan. - Yes.
I'm here.
Goroza.
Since you know Gunbei, it'll be easy
to recreate his face.
One moment.
What you have to do now is for
the sake of the Yagyu-Clan.
Are you ready to die for us?
- I am.
You'll have to slit open your belly.
I, Retsudo,
will assist you.
It shall be done.
Forgive me ...
Officiually the Yagyu-art of
fighting is inferior to the
art of fighting of Itto Ogami.
From now on Itto Ogami, as the
Kaishakunin of the Shogun, will
wear the colours of the Shogunate.
The more than 60 Lords of our
country will tremble with respect.
His fame as a master of the sword
will grow.
The Yagyu Clan will always be
measured by his deeds.
Using the false Gunbei we'll
at least be able to...
restore a part...
of our honour, but it'll never
be the same again.
We must prepare a trap for Itto
Ogami. Making him look like
he's acting unloyal against
the Shogunate.
We will destroy his house and
his name.
And we will get the position of
Kaishakunin back for
our family.
Had I killed you when I had the
chance to,
my brothers wouldn't have had
to die ...
l will take revenge,
ltto Ogami.
And glory will return to the name
of Yagyu.
If I kill you now it'll be over.
Can you defeat me?
Kill me!
Why don't you kil me?
- You are already dead.
Makes no sense to kill the dead.
l speak to Amida-Buddha.
We, father and son, walk the
ways of darkness.
We even kill our own parents.
even Buddha, when we meet him.
Dad.
Once there was a group of people,
they were Goumes,artists living on
the streets, not beggars.
Like street-musicians,
No-dancer, comedians,
actors and storytellers.
They belonged to the Jindayu 
Gomune organization,
They were spread throughout the 
country and had a special status.
Who are you?
I'd like to speak to
Master Jindayu Gomune.
l am ltto Ogami and this is my
only son Daigoro.
I won't let a hired Assassin kill
Oyuki.
Kill him!
You are not my enemies.
Dad.
A scary little boy.
Quiet! You treat your guests in a
disrespectful manner.
Yes.
l don't know, who's there,
but I am Jindayu Gomune.
l am ltto Ogami and I came here
for some questions.
Come in.
- But Master ...
Let him in!
- Yes.
You're trying to find Oyuki
to kill her?
What else could an Assassin
want to do.
Poor girl to have a skilled figter
like you behind her.
Did the Owari-Klan hire you?
Forgive me...
Foolish to ask an Assassin a question
like that.
Oyuki was one of us.
- as you already suspected.
She was trained as a swordfighter
from the time when she was a little
girl. 
Lord Owari, who was travelling 
incognito discovered her because
of her fighting skills.
So he made Oyuki.
his Besshikime to train his
people the art
of swordfighting
As a leader of the Gomune,
I can't tell you more.
Whatever happened to her and why
she got tattooed and started 
being an Assassin, I don't know..
None of my businesses
Sure, I heard some rumors, but I 
never tried to find out more...
And if I knew I probably wouldn't
tell you.
As you also supected,
she isn't a Gomune any more.
On the road to Kiso, close
to Akasaka, there is a
thermal bath named
''Tsuta no Yu''.
It is known that it fulfills
your dreams and desires if you 
go there, pray to the god of bathing
and spend 7 days and nigts there,
doing the neccessary rituals.
If you have a wish, you might
consider going there.
Thank you. l'll have to go now.
Master Ogami.
Oyuki is my daughter.
At the end of this ascent you'll
find ''Tsuta no Yu''.
It's a lonely place.
At this time of the year there's
nobody there.
You challenge me? It's ridiculous.
- Shut up!
l'll expose your deceitful
style.
Where are you looking at?
Look into the fire,
and you'll loose.
Don't look into the fire! 
Concentrate or you'll loose.
Don't fall for my delusion!
Look me in the eyes!
Don't look in the fire!
Look me in the eyes and fight!
The eyes, look me in the eyes!
Look me in the eyes!
The eyes! Look in the eyes!
Look me in the eyes!
Why should such a beauty become
a Besshikime?
Women who seek for the arts
of war are the ugly ones,
unable to get a man.
You regained consciousness, but it's
too late.
Bite off your tung after I'm
through with you.
Daigoro.
He has no mother, please 
be kind to him.
l beg you,
kill
Oyuki!
Forgive me, but those who
come here seek for their desires
to be fulfilled.
Is that what you're here for?
To kill me,
that is your desire.
Yuki, the expelled! ln the name
of the lord you'll die.
Get ready!
- Kill her!
I've already heard you being
after me.
I know your name. You are the lone
wolf with cub.
Tell me. Why do you cut off the
knots from the samurais you killed?
I got expelled from the Owari-Clan.
So it's natural that the head of
the Owari wants me to get killed.
If I cut of the knots of my
persecutors and send them back,
Enki Kozuka, whom I wish to kill
will be sent after me one day.
That is the reason.
Then I ask you: The Families of
these Samurais were dishonoured
by what you did to them.
Many committed suicide.
How will you ever stand the hate
you evoke? The only reason for all
their pain and suffering is your 
revenge against one man.
And I am here to seek revenge for
their suffering ...
I met your father, Jindayu Gomune.
He told me you were his daughter.
My father ...
My father
wants me to die,
doesn't he ...?
Sometimes I think there can be...
no greater luck for a child than 
parents...
whose desire is it's death.
Oyuki.
Finally you have come, Enki Kozuka.
You have become even more beautiful.
This costume fits better to 
the Gomune-people.
You need help?
I won't need help to kill you,
scum!
It's different from last time.
This time you'll have to die.
Where are you looking at?
l teached you not to look
in the fire.
The eyes!
Look me in the eyes!
Eyes ...
Look in the eyes ...
ln my eyes ...
Look me in the eyes!
The eyes!
Look me in the eyes!
So that I can die without
showing my skin,
I'm happy then.
l'll make sure nobody will see 
your skin.
I'm grateful that you come to..
bring me the urn!
One question ...
I hope her death wasn't disgraceful?
She died full from grace.
It's about time ...
One moment ...
Could you, who were here when she
died stay here for a while,
to calm down her soul?
Call it an act of providence 
and tell me from my daughter's
last hours
So you are telling me, he killed
Oyuki andd Enki?
My people saw it with their
very own eyes.
So the rumors are true.
That's not a matter of the
Shogunate any more,
it's a question of honour.
Not only has he violated your 
territory, He's seeking lodging
with these ordinary Gomunes.
That is proof enough.
If you won't react,
you'll make a fool out
of yourselves.
I can't let him go!
Bastard!
Lord! The Samurai of the
Owari-Clan attack us.
What are you doing? We won't let
you through! - Shoot!
Here, here is he!
Back. Stand still!
Are you Jindayu Gomune?
Yes.
What are you doing here?
It is said the assassin, the lone
wolf with cub, hides here.
Hand him over and nothing will
happen to you.
Otherwise we have orders to
kill you all.
I refuse!
- Are you crazy?
Don't you care for yourself
any more?
It's about time for us to go.
- Don't go, Master Ogami!
Master Jindayu,
I came of my free will, so let
me go of my free will.
- You can't.
Will you resist?
Master Ogami
is my guest.
What would you do if we asked you
to hand us over a guest of,
Lord Fürsten Owari?
Don't get impudent, scum!
Who do you think you are?
- Let me tell you something!
Lord Owaris property
is around 619.000 Koku.
he has 4.000 men serving him.
ln comparison there are...
more than 20.000 Gomune-people,
who serve me.
This is not about strength and
power...
It's about respect.
If Lord Owari is human, we
are too...
As well as him we eat the rice,
and shit it out.
We take hospitality for granted.
And we can't hand you over a guest
even when you threaten us.
We Gomunes have pride as well.
Scum!
Keep calm!
- Master!
Damned, you ...!
- finish them!
Keep cool! Do not attack!
Master Jindayu!
Master Ogami ...
Take my head and hand it over
to Lord Owari.
Tell Lord Owari her father
payed you to kill
Oyuki.
Me, Oyukis father has killed,
his fallen daughter,
in in his name.
As her father I ask for his
forgiveness with my death.
Master Jindayu.
The father's heart is like the
heart of his child.
Oyuki ...
As if Oyuki ...
... were calling me.
hurry. I have to ...
... come to her ...
Master!
Master!
- Master!
Guide me to Lord Owari!
Take a bow! Hold on!
l speak to Lord Owari.
l am no prisoner, I am here of
my own free will.
What?
Enki Kozuka is the one responsible
for all that happened.
Oyuki left your clan, because
was terribly harmed by him.
She got rid of the disgrace
by killing Enki.
I have come to tell you this.
You are ridiculous!
Who do you think are you 
talking to?
Jindayu Gomune isn't connected in any
way to the Owari-Clan.
To kill him is inexcusable.
You are irrevent! l am Yoshinao from the
Tokugawa-Family. You know where you are?
Me and my son,
walk the way of hell.
Neither do we care for the Tokugawa,
nor do we care for the Shogunate.
Kill them!
Kill these fools!
Daigoro!
Your life is in my hands.
Don't move!
Don't dare to move or your
Lord's life and all your wealth
will vanish.
are you gonna take the 
responsibilities?
Listen, Master Kashiwagi.
Until we left this castle,
Lord Owari will be our hostage.
Stand up!
Step forward!
You scum!
Don't do anything you'd regret
lateron!
Master Ogami,
wait!
One moment!
Please wait!
Master Ogami,
let me accompany you.
l refuse!
The please spare the life of
our Master.
I won't do himno harm.
Come, hurry!
Lord!
Lord Owari, take cover!
Stop, don't shoot!
- Lord!
Daigoro, listen carefully!
Your father walks the way of hell.
If I won't return, you'll have
to die here too.
You understand?
Attack him!
- Yes.
Retsudo, fight!
Take that!
ltto Ogami, take this strike from
the Yagyu-Clans!
Dad?
Dad.
Dad.
Dad.
Dad!
Daigoro, pull the sword out
of my back!
ltto Ogami, you survived the
fight quite well.
No matter what will happen,
you must survive.
Neither the Yagyu nor the Kurokuwa...
I will defeat you.
One day I will send you to hell
Until then ...
