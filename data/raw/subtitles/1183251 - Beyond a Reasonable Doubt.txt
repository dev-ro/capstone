Does it have to be that tight?
Well, we have to be absolutely
sure you can't see.
Don't we?
Now don't be nervous.
I'll... I'll try not to be.
All right, here we go.
Okay, next.
This is difficult.
- Can I try the first one again?
- No problem.
Here you are.
This one.
Yes, this one.
Now are you sure?
You don't want to try any of the others?
No, I'm sure.
This is the best.
Okay, why don't you take your blindfold
off and see which one you chose?
I can't believe it.
We tested 100 people,
22 of which chose the instant coffee
just like Marsha here.
Another 29 people
chose the canned coffee.
That's a total of 51% who chose
the instant or canned coffee
over the $3-a-cup gourmet brand.
So the next time
you reach for your wallet,
are you really paying
for a superior blend,
or just a very fancy name?
This is CJ Nicholas for the News 8
Shreveport investigative team.
Hey, thanks, guys.
- I really appreciate it.
- That was hard hitting.
- I have chills.
- I hear the networks calling you.
Could you give me some cutaways?
And I'd really appreciate it
if you'd both bite me.
There really isn't much more to say.
Lucinda Harris was 22 years old.
She's never gonna have a career.
- Did I miss it?
- Almost.
She's never gonna have a marriage.
She's never gonna be able
to have her own baby,
hold it in her arms.
And her parents there are never
gonna be able to kiss her again,
watch how her life unfolds.
It's over.
It's done.
And do you know why?
Because this man sitting right here,
Andre Benson, felt that she didn't
give him her purse fast enough.
Oh, she gave it to him, all right.
Just not fast enough for Mr. Benson.
So he shot her.
He shot her three times.
Only once, she might
have been wounded.
Two times,
there would have been
a spark of life left in her.
So he made sure.
He made triple sure.
Now the defense would like to tell you
that our whole case is circumstantial.
There is no eyewitness,
no ballistic match,
no alibi.
Andre Benson was home
in his apartment alone
watching TV.
Probably "Jeopardy."
The defense can also explain
why Mr. Benson ran
from the scene of the crime
when the police came
to his back door.
He's a young black man
in a high crime area.
Naturally you hear a loud bang
on your door, you get scared.
But do you know what?
We made sure too.
We made triple sure.
There's one thing he can't explain.
This cigarette butt
with Andre Benson's DNA
all over it
was found at the scene
of the crime
lying right next
to the deceased.
Now you have heard
the expert testimony
of the crime lab.
The odds of this not being
Andre Benson's DNA
is 6 billion to one.
That's right, 6 billion,
with a B,
to one.
Hunter dribbles behind
the three-point line.
Here comes the shot.
Now if you're willing to take that bet,
then I don't want to be
your district attorney.
- I want to be your bookie.
- Swish.
With this latest victory, you have
never lost a murder case.
Are you going to announce
your candidacy for governor?
- The latest polls have you ahead.
- One at a time, please.
- Are you running for governor?
- It's Paul, right?
Paul, let me tell you something.
A beautiful young woman's life
was taken away in a moment
of incomprehensible violence.
That's what today is about.
Now why do moments like this
keep happening on our streets?
Those are the things
we have to ask ourselves.
Tonight when we all go home,
we have our nice dinners,
we have to ask
what would make a man
take an innocent human life
and treat it with such little respect?
Just snuff it out
like a match in the wind?
Now my only hope
out of this whole ordeal
is that Mr. and Mrs. Harris
will bring some closure to their life.
Today is not about keeping score.
It's not about politics.
Today was a real tragedy.
Thank you.
Could he be smoother?
I got a chubby just watching.
Listen, I'll meet you
back at the station, okay?
Hey, dude, I keep on telling you.
She's out of your league.
And I'm gonna keep on trying.
Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey. Hi.
CJ, you've been
at the trial a lot.
- You noticed me.
- I noticed you staring at me.
That means you were looking at me.
I was looking at you staring.
- You're staring again.
- No, this is my look.
- I'm not staring.
- Hmm.
- I came to beg a favor.
- Again?
We're doing a companion piece
on police interrogation techniques
and I was wondering whether you'd
give me the police interview tape.
Now why would I do that?
'Cause then you get to
go out to dinner with me.
I can't go out to dinner with you.
It's not meal specific.
Could be lunch, perhaps a beverage.
- CJ, I can't.
- Why not?
- You're a reporter.
- And you work for the district attorney.
- I don't hold that against you.
- You don't like Mark Hunter?
- Not much.
- Why?
Or why not?
Whichever is correct.
A lot of reasons.
Too many to mention here.
- Why is correct.
- Give me one.
Too smooth.
Way too smooth.
And I'm not sure he's honest.
You say these things about my boss and
you expect me to have dinner with you?
I don't expect.
I hope.
And I don't want to go out to dinner with
him, I want to go out to dinner with you.
Besides, there's gonna be so many things
that we disagree on over the years...
favorite colors, small dogs...
I hate the little yappers...
electric or manual toothbrush...
countless things we're gonna
have to work through.
I promise I won't look or stare.
You'd really be helping me out
if you could get me that tape.
What harm could it do?
- The trial's over.
- I'll send it to your office.
- In person would be much...
- I'll send it to your office.
- better.
- Chinese.
- What?
I like Chinese food.
Chinese.
Definitely Chinese.
But just dinner. You're not gonna
get me into bed on the first date.
- What was I thinking?
- I have principles.
Hey hey, that same lady who keeps
calling and won't leave her name,
she called twice today.
You're a very bad boy, CJ.
You're my hero.
Oh, I don't know about...
- Uh, excuse me. You can't go in.
- Don't worry about it. He's expecting us.
- You look great, by the way.
- Sir?
- Thank you, Val.
- I got it.
- This is the big one.
- Sit your ass down.
District Attorney
Mark Hunter is faking
forensic evidence to get
convictions in murder trials.
He's not sitting his ass down.
I am though.
Ass is right down.
Snug.
This is his idea.
- I've got proof.
- Sit your ass down.
Hear me out.
Three years ago
Hunter lost a string of cases.
Now that's not something
a district attorney is supposed to do.
And then badda-bing...
17 murder convictions in a row.
Now he's leading the polls
for governor.
You think maybe he's on a lucky streak?
DAs don't try cases
they don't expect to win.
Okay, take a look at this.
Oh my God.
It's the crime scene photo
from the Andre Benson case.
Why am I listening to you?
There was no footprint match,
no fiber match,
no trace that Andre Benson
was even there,
except for this cigarette butt.
So Andre Benson had the presence
of mind to pick up his shell casings
but not his cigarette butt
that he left right next to the victim's hand?
I think you used the word proof?
The interview tape.
Just bear with me here.
The detective on the left,
one Anthony Merchant.
Now before Hunter joined the DA's
office, he was a police detective
and his partner for many
of those years was none other
than Detective Lieutenant
Anthony Merchant.
Now watch.
Okay, here we go.
That's how they got the cigarette
butt with Benson's DNA.
- It's right there in front of us.
- This is your proof?
You going along with this?
All of these 17 convictions
were decided by DNA evidence.
In each case the lead detective was
none other than Anthony Merchant.
How did you get that tape?
From a source.
And I bet this source has a skirt.
Does it matter?
- Not really.
- Then what is it?
I mean, this is a story...
a monster story.
I just received the new budget.
We can't afford the investigation
team anymore.
- What?
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Come on.
- Have you looked at your ratings?
- No.
- Well, it's not a pretty sight.
It just so happens that the folks
who own this place
have this funny little obsession
about ratings.
It seems that ratings pay the rent.
No ratings, no rent.
So you guys are both
going on general assignment.
- Oh, come on.
- I don't like this any more than you do.
Hey, I saw your documentary.
That's why I hired you. I know you're good.
- What about this story?
- What story?
You've got some stones coming
in here using the word proof.
You answer me one simple question:
How in the hell could Detective Merchant
plant that cigarette at the crime scene
when the interview took place
three days after
the crime scene photographs
were taken?
Well...
Pick up your assignments
at the front desk and get out of here.
I would just like to say
that is an excellent tie.
Out!
I've been assigned to our fearless
sportscaster and his lovely toupee.
You're doing a piece on people
over 65 who run the 10k.
Hunter's dirty.
I can feel it in my bones.
And I'm gonna prove it.
I've worked too hard to go back
to baby rhinos at the zoo.
There's baby rhinos at the zoo?
What? No, it's a metaphor.
- You know, baby rhinos, kitten in a tree.
- Right.
- So there's no baby rhinos?
- Would you shut up?
Hey, CJ, that woman
is on the line again.
Yeah, okay.
I'll take it.
- Yeah, line 7.
- Thanks.
- Do you mind?
- No, not at all. Go ahead.
- Get the hell out of here.
- Call me if you need me.
Hello?
Yeah.
Listen, now's...
this isn't really a good time.
Yes.
No, I'm not.
Things aren't going
very well for me right now.
I understand.
Okay.
I will.
I promise.
Thank you.
You should have seen
that 10k.
There should be an age limit
for wearing spandex.
Sorry I missed it.
I didn't come out here
to do stories like that.
Who does?
Right.
You're not staring at me.
You told me I wasn't allowed to.
I didn't think you'd actually listen.
I'm feeling too sorry for myself
to do any good staring.
- That's a damn shame.
- I could try.
Give it your best shot.
That's not too bad.
I could do much better.
This is my B stare.
If I ever give you my full stare...
Shut up.
Keep staring.
I felt so sorry for you.
You looked so sad
at the table.
Ah yes, the whole
end-of-my-career thing.
I was making that up.
It's not the end of your career.
- It's not exactly a promotion.
- Yeah, but it's not the end.
All you have to do
is something really good.
Really good,
and they'll have to put it on.
Well, I...
think I might have something.
Might have.
- Maybe.
- Well, what is it?
Not now.
I just can't tell you now.
I don't even have it yet.
And it's privileged.
Everything I said
when I took my clothes off,
that's privileged.
Morning.
Good morning is right.
Coffee?
Thank you.
What's in your kitchen?
A stove, a refrigerator
that makes ice cubes.
What about eggs?
Yes, eggs.
I can do eggs.
- And maybe even some toast?
- Mmm.
Holy shit.
You won an award.
Yeah, that's what brought me out here.
I was working for a little station
in Buffalo, New York.
You know, Mark Twain once said that to
commit suicide in Buffalo was redundant.
I did this piece
on a girl, Taieesha,
15-year-old kid, got pregnant
by her stepfather
and her mother kicked her
out of the house.
She had no home,
no place to go
in the middle
of December in Buffalo.
You can't even begin to imagine
what winters are like there.
Found her living on the streets
hooking to make money.
It's nice to know people will pay
to have sex with a pregnant teenager.
She was in a snowstorm
when she went into labor.
I'd like to see it.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Okay.
She was so little.
She wouldn't let me show her face.
Felt like she could break
if you held her wrong.
I cleaned her off as best I could.
I knew I had to keep her warm.
I wrapped her underneath my coat.
I could feel her against my breast.
After a while I felt her grow,
you know, cold
up against my skin.
I knew the church,
they'd take care of her.
They'd bury my baby girl.
When I started to walk away
I just couldn't see her wrapped
in all those newspapers
in front of the church.
I couldn't.
I knew she was with God.
Still...
I couldn't look back.
Jane Doe's mother had a...
Wow.
I, uh, don't really know
what to say.
It's... I'd like to see the rest.
Go ahead, take it.
I've got a bunch of copies.
- She, uh...
- What happened to her?
She died of an overdose
two weeks after the interview.
She never got to see the piece
or the attention it got.
So they brought me out here.
It's not much bigger,
but at least I got my own
investigative unit.
And now that's gone.
CJ, you really are
a good reporter.
Hey, no no.
You said you had an idea.
Well, go, follow it.
Look, I told you
this is not a good time.
All right, I will.
Just stay calm.
You dropped your pens.
Later.
Four, four, good.
I'm not close.
Stay on that way.
Focus here.
No seven.
I need you. I need you.
- Come on.
- Come on, I was on a roll.
- Yeah, I noticed.
- What's happening?
How far would you go
for the story of your lifetime?
I mean, you know me,
farther than far.
Would you risk everything?
Depends on what you mean
by everything.
Everything means everything,
including going to prison.
- You're kidding.
- Never been more serious in my entire life.
Jesus. I mean, I don't know.
I'm talking about the biggest story
we've ever dreamed of.
I'm talking about the Pulitzer Prize.
- You're also talking about prison.
- Just hear me out.
When I'm done, you say no
we don't do it. It's your choice.
Of course it will mean you'll spend
the rest of your numbered days
producing ticky tidbits
from a minor league infield.
And it'll also mean
you have no scrotal sack.
We gonna cut to commercial
before we do Final Jeopardy?
Right, cut to the chase.
We both know that Hunter is bringing
in fake DNA to get those convictions.
- Right.
- We don't know exactly how,
- but we know that he's doing it.
- Mm-hmm.
- You with me?
- So far, yeah.
Well, there's one way
we can prove it.
- And is this the risky part?
- Not yet.
First we have to wait
for the right murder.
What do you...
the right murder?
The murder of some
anonymous person, okay?
Some junkie or hooker
where the cops have no suspect
and they really don't give a shit.
And there's got to be some
vague physical evidence
like a tire track
or a footprint.
Not a lot.
And it's got to happen
when I have no alibi.
Who needs an ali...
why can't you have one?
I can't have an alibi 'cause that's when
we plant the circumstantial evidence.
We what?
We plant enough circumstantial
evidence that it points to me.
- You're shitting me.
- I shit you not.
We not only plant it,
you document us planting it.
You tape me doing it,
each time with the day's
newspaper in the shot.
That way we can prove that
the evidence came after the fact.
Aren't there laws
against this kind of thing?
More than one.
Anyway, enough circumstantial evidence
and District Attorney Mark S Hunter
won't be able to resist.
He'll arrest me, he'll indict me
and he'll put me on trial.
And not only will he
have a high profile case,
he will have a truly sexy, juicy,
front page lead story
that'll tie up the nomination
for governor.
And he'll have a white defendant
that he won't be able to resist.
Is there a change of seasons
on your planet?
Because he could never ever
ever afford to lose this case.
And he'll only have
circumstantial evidence.
Some trace of my DNA
will suddenly be found,
just like it was in all the other cases.
Only this time after he introduces it,
you get the video
and we show it in court.
You think there's a chance a judge
won't have much of a sense of humor
about this?
A judge will go stark raving apeshit.
The pandemonium this'll create
by graphically proving
that Hunter is crooked,
that'll overshadow everything.
Do you have any idea
how big of a story this will be?
Do you really think the DA's office
is gonna want to prosecute us
after this thing breaks?
Look, we know a wrong
is being committed
by a man that may become
our next governor.
We are investigative reporters.
This is our chance to prove it.
It's perfect.
I don't know, man.
Come on, this is our chance.
This could be our Pulitzer.
This is the diem
that we have to carpe.
This is the proverbial pot that we
have to shit or get off of.
This right here, right now,
this is it.
God help me.
I'm in.
No, God help Mark Hunter.
I don't know, Ella.
You're either awfully late
for your trial or really early.
You okay?
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.
It's just tomorrow
is my first day as lead so I'm trying to...
Thought maybe the best way to prepare
is sit here in the courtroom alone, huh?
That's what I did at my first trial.
You know, worked for me.
You see that judge's bench,
that big old fancy seal, the flag,
the jury box and you go, "Whoa.
This is big.
This is really big stuff."
And it is.
We put bad guys away.
That's what we do.
And if you're sure...
I mean down to your marrow sure...
that defendant is guilty,
that jury is going
to follow you anywhere.
But if you've got
even an inkling of a doubt,
you'll lose them like sand
right through your fingers.
It's amazing. They can smell doubt.
I don't know how they do it.
So I guess the most important
thing is to be sure.
- Are you?
- Yes.
- No doubts?
- No.
You make them feel that,
you're not gonna have any
problem at all.
That, you know, and maybe work
the room a little bit, okay?
Okay.
- Ella, good night.
- Good night.
- And good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
- CJ, wake up!
- Jesus Christ.
Ow! Shit!
- CJ!
- Coming. Take it easy.
Is she here? I was hoping to
barge in on the two of you.
I'm dying to see her naked.
No, she's got a trial in the morning.
- What's going on?
- Why are you limping?
I came down on my ankle
funny when I got out of bed
because some asshole woke me
up at 4:00 in the morning.
What?
What is it?
Get dressed.
Gentlemen.
And I use that term loosely
with the fourth estate.
How'd you get here so fast?
We do have police scanners
in the newsroom, you know.
Really? Next thing you're gonna
tell me is you have a color TV.
- Who is she?
- Dead black junkie hooker.
Her purse was full of condoms.
Most of her customers must be white
'cause the condoms
are regular size.
Cute. Homicide?
Four stab wounds
to the chest and neck.
I'm gonna go way out
on a limb and say yes.
Got any leads?
Got a witness.
Fella over there saw the whole thing.
Or at least his dog did.
It bit the perp.
- Any physical evidence?
- Got a pretty good footprint.
What about the knife?
Did you find the knife?
Why are you so interested?
The victim doesn't have to be famous
for us to be interested.
Whatever you say.
- I'm gonna check him out.
- Yeah, all right.
Listen, think maybe I could take a look
at the crime scene report and photos?
- Now why the hell would I do that?
- I got two primo Springsteen tickets.
Springsteen?
Bruce Springsteen?
- No, his cousin Ralph.
- Do I look white to you?
What?
Do I look white to you?
Well, in certain angles.
Your Mr. Springsteen does not
do it for me. I am unmoved.
We're talking about The Boss here.
No, he's your Boss.
He ain't mine.
Did I mention backstage passes?
I mean, do you have any idea
what women will do
for backstage passes to Springsteen?
Take a good look at me.
This is exactly
what unmoved looks like.
I'll think of something.
You always do, my brother.
You always do.
Goody bag from Nickerson...
all the reports and crime scene photos.
I knew he couldn't pass up
Springsteen tickets.
All right, let's see
what we've got here.
Ooh, wow. Ha.
Shoeprint came in from some loopy
Italian sneaker called Montalvo.
They don't make it anymore.
Size 10-12. What are you?
11 and a half. He never went
for the Springsteen tickets.
They also found a can
of pepper spray at the scene.
Probably the victim's.
What did he go for?
The witness heard an argument
between a man and a woman.
He heard the man cry out in pain.
She probably sprayed him.
Then the woman screamed,
the dog took off,
bit the perp and the guy ran away.
- Got him Saint's tickets.
- Perfect. What kind of dog?
Jack Russell terrier.
45-yard line.
Jim Carrey, "The Mask"...
love that film.
45 yard line?
That's like my seats. What row?
The witness didn't see the perp but said
he was wearing a dark jogging suit.
Looked like Reebok because it had
two stripes down the side.
He was positive it had two stripes,
sneakers and a dark ski mask.
And he was holding a knife
with a dark handle.
Row 22.
Stab wounds are consistent
with a switchblade, around four inches.
That's the same row as...
Dude, tell me you didn't
give him my tickets.
- You're not telling me.
- It's for one season.
You said one reason, right?
Not one season.
What does it say about the victim?
You are beyond a prick.
I am a prick that is going to win
us a Pulitzer Prize, my friend.
- Now have they ID'd the victim yet?
- Doris Ruth Owens.
Shit.
She was just 22 years old.
Lots of arrests for solicitation,
some for drugs.
A coulpe here in Shreveport.
Nice.
Others in Virginia, Maryland,
New Jersey, New York.
One way to see America...
on your back.
22 years old.
So let's make our shopping list.
We really gonna do this?
You boys lost?
Crate & Barrel is about
four blocks that way.
Actually, we're...
we're looking for a switchblade,
about four inches.
Some bully picking on you during recess?
Taking your lunch money?
- It's got to have a white handle.
- Switchblades are illegal.
- I know that.
- You a cop?
- No.
- What about your sister over there?
Who, me? Cop? No.
Do I look like a cop?
You know?
- It's a prop.
- A what?
We're making an independent film.
One of the characters
has to use it in the scene.
350.
You've got to be joking.
Do I look like the type of man
that tells a joke?
No, you don't.
Come on.
I mean, it's way too much.
Well, why don't you try Walmart?
Maybe they'll have one.
Wait.
350
and throw in a can of pepper spray.
Sounds like a pretty violent
movie you two are making.
- Yeah.
- That's what sells.
Cash only.
You got 150?
How's it going?
All right.
- Can I get a receipt?
- No.
- Why not?
- 'Cause I never sold you that.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Go right ahead.
What happens with that nose ring
when you sneeze?
It gets snot on it.
Okay, let's...
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Are you looking for
a specific type of dog?
A Jack Russell terrier.
Like the kind in "Mask"
or "Frasier."
I think I know what a Jack Russell is.
Thank you.
We have one
that's mostly Jack Russell.
He's out there.
He's not a purebred.
If you're looking for a pedigree,
this is not the right place for you.
- Is he the same size?
- Yes.
Could we see his teeth?
You can tell he's not too old.
These little fellas
can be a real handful.
You might want to think
about getting him fixed.
- He's completely housebroken.
- That makes one of you.
- We'll take him.
- That's a wonderful thing you're doing.
Would you mind holding this up?
For posterity.
I know what it's like.
My wife has to document every occasion
like it's a presidential inauguration.
Well, I hope he brings
lots of happiness
to you both.
- Thanks.
- Appreciate it.
- Come on.
- Here you go.
These doggy treats actually
smell kind of good.
I think I might try one.
- I'm gonna name him Woodward.
- Nice.
All right, Woodward.
That's it, get it.
Bite the pants.
Come on.
There you go, buddy. Bite it.
Yeah, get 'em.
All right, grab a beer.
- I'm gonna throw these things on.
- All right.
Ow! Not yet, you moron.
Finley, get in here.
- What happened?
- Look at this.
- God damn, this hurts.
- Damn! From that little dog?
- Shit.
- Give me the newspaper.
- Put it in the shot.
- All right.
Grab that.
Little bastard wouldn't even wait
for me to get everything ready.
- You got it?
- Got it.
Who the hell wears a Montalvo?
Never heard of it.
We searched every
retailer in Shreveport.
None of them have ever
carried a Montalvo.
They stopped making it in 1999.
That tells you how popular they were.
Maybe the guy is from Italy.
Right, this has all the earmarks
of a mafia hit.
What about a tourist, you know,
looking for some late-night action?
Maybe.
- I don't know.
- This smells like an evidence box
stored next to all those other evidence
boxes of unsolved homicides.
I hate that smell.
I really do.
All right, let's do this.
Okay.
Yeah, there you go.
Okay.
- Got that?
- Yup. Sure you want to do this?
I'm sure I don't want to do it.
It's just the pattern may be different
- if we just sprayed the mask.
- Okay.
Think Katie Couric would do this
for a story?
She had a colonoscopy on national
television for God's sake.
Huh.
Okay, here goes.
God! Shit!
Oh shit. Put your head up.
Grab the newspaper.
- I can't see.
- Grab it. It's right...
Oh God, I'm tasting it.
- Christ, that burns.
- Just hold it up.
You're all heart, you know that?
You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Okay, the water. Give me the water.
Tomorrow night's the night.
We could go to jail for this,
couldn't we?
- It's possible.
- Just checking.
All right, I'm gonna make
a backup disc
and I'm gonna keep the original
locked in my desk.
You can back out now
if you really want to.
Just give me the tape
and the backup DVD
and I'll never reveal
you were behind the camera.
What if they threaten you with jail?
I'll already be in jail,
so what the hell's the difference?
Okay, what if they go all Guantanamo
on you and start doing torture shit?
- Then I'd definitely crack.
- Exactly.
But I couldn't bear the thought of you
winning the Pulitzer all by yourself.
Just remember, we can't breathe
a word of this to anyone.
Not even my own lawyer can know.
Nothing, or he'll be disbarred.
- All right.
- Nobody can know.
Absolutely nobody.
No exceptions.
What about the lady with the fantastic
tits that works at that bar on Piedmont?
- Okay, just her.
- And what about the one with the tattoo?
Shut up.
- I'm just as scared as you are.
- No you're not.
This way.
Come on.
- You lied to me.
- What?
- You said you hated small dogs.
- Oh.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I was at the animal shelter
doing a story.
He was pretty hard to resist.
He promised he wouldn't yap.
- Hello. What's your name?
- You're asking him?
Probably gonna have
a bit of a wait there.
- It's Woodward.
- Hello, Woody.
Your eyes are red.
Have you been crying?
Just allergies from the dog.
- Hello. Oh.
- Would you stop that?
- Oh my.
- I would like to kiss you, you know.
- What's stopping you?
- He is. It'd be like kissing him.
No, there's a difference.
Try it.
Come on.
Don't be a chicken.
Ugh!
See? Now me.
Mmm.
No thanks. I prefer sugar
with my coffee, not salt.
Oh, sorry.
It's understandable,
they're both white.
- Where are you?
- What?
Where are you?
I'm, uh...
I'm just a little distracted.
It's nothing.
I'm sorry.
It's because I said the L word
last night, isn't it?
- You said you're a lesbian?
- Don't bullshit me now.
I'm sorry.
I was an idiot.
I didn't mean to pressure you.
I just got kind of carried away
in the heat of passion.
No. No, that's not it.
I was glad you said it.
I was thrilled.
Actually, I feel the same way.
Was it just the heat of passion
that made you say it?
No. You do?
What? I'm confused now.
No, it wasn't the heat
of passion that made me say it.
You do feel the same way?
You know I do.
- I...
- You don't have to say it.
No, I think I do.
I love you.
Listen to me.
Listen to me very carefully.
- You might hear some things.
- What kind of things?
Things...
not necessarily good things.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm asking you to trust me.
Are you married?
No.
Do you have a brood of illegitimate
children in ports around the world?
- Not a one.
- Do you have a disease
where body parts I like
are gonna start falling off?
- No.
- Then we'll be fine.
Come on.
Here we go.
Oh, man.
I had to see this for myself.
Well, my brother,
you really have done it.
Go ahead, have your fun.
Give it your best shot.
You couldn't take my intermediate
much less my best shot.
So I will remember this sight as one
of those Kodak moments,
which unfortunately was all too brief.
Good news is you made bail.
Your friend Finley
is on his way upstairs.
Last name Nicholas,
first name Christopher,
middle name John;
Driving while shitfaced.
Sign here.
The lesser good news is
your brethren in the press
are gathered outside with
their lights and their cameras
and their need for blood.
They are a hungry bunch.
I arranged for your friend to park
in the department garage
which would allow you
to avoid your colleagues
and sneak out the back.
I owe you.
I really do.
I'll think of something.
I'm sure you will.
Hey, guys.
- You ready?
- Yup.
Thanks again.
No problem.
No problem at all.
No problem at all.
Ella.
Something happened tonight.
No no no, no accident.
I'm fine.
I am, really.
It's just I sort of got arrested...
more like actually arrested
for DUI.
No, don't come over,
I feel shitty enough as it is.
Wait a minute.
Someone's at the door.
Yeah, hold on.
I'm coming.
Ella, I'm gonna have to call you back.
Remember what I said the other morning?
You know, the l-love-you thing.
Well, it's still happening.
I love you.
Shreveport Police Department.
Open up now.
All right, I'm coming.
Just give me a second, for Christ's sake.
Open the door
or we will break it down.
This is a warrant to search your home.
I need you to read it
and then sign it.
Lift your trouser leg, please.
You mind telling me
what this is all about?
The pant leg, CJ.
Let's try the other leg.
Well well,
what do we have here?
- It's nothing.
- No, it most definitely is something.
Lift the bandage and let me see.
- And how'd you get that?
- It's from him.
Hey, Lieutenant.
- Turn around, please.
- What?
Turn around now.
CJ Nicholas, you are under arrest
for the murder
of Doris Ruth Owens.
- Are you crazy?
- Anything you say
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one...
I'm sure Mr. Nicholas understands
his Miranda rights.
- Isn't that right, Mr. Nicholas?
- I understand my rights.
What I don't understand is why
I'm being arrested for murder.
Thank you very much, Detective Nickerson.
I'll take it from here.
- What?
- I said I'll take it from here.
- Are you taking my collar?
- He remains your collar.
No one is taking anything
away from you.
You'll get all the credit for your work.
I'm taking over the investigation
by request of the DA.
I don't get this.
But I also realize when it ain't mine to get.
The best seats to any event
ain't gonna get you out of this.
I called you every day.
I know you have.
I don't understand.
Why haven't you called me back?
- You shouldn't be here.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't want you getting hurt.
- It's too late for that.
No, listen to me.
It's your boss who's prosecuting me.
Your boss, for God's sake.
You can't have anything
to do with me.
I have everything to do with you.
I have no choice.
Have you thought about what would
happened to your career if Hunter
- found out about the two of us?
- My career?
Are you kidding me?
My career?
This is about your life here.
I'm gonna resign from the DA's office
and join your defense.
No. No, you can't do that.
You can't.
I'm gonna be okay.
- You sound like a Martian.
- I'm telling you I'm gonna be okay.
You're in a lot of trouble.
Promise me you're not gonna
do something stupid.
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?
This has something to do
with Hunter, doesn't it?
- Why would you ask that?
- You have some kind of fixation with him.
This has something to do
with him, doesn't it?
I'm asking you to trust me.
There's something
you're not telling me.
Here's what you need to know:
I love you.
And I'm innocent.
I can't have you mixed up in this.
Please help me by understanding
what I'm saying.
Love me enough to trust me.
Can you do that?
Thank you.
