<b>"One Wild Moment"</b>
The sea,
See her dancing
Along the bright gulfs
Reflections of silver
The sea
Reflections shimmer
In the rain
The sea
In the summer sky
Her white sheep fly
With angels so pure
The sea
Azure shepherdess
Infinite
See
Near the ponds
Those tall wet reeds
See
Those white birds
And those rusted houses
The sea
Has calmed them all
Along the bright gulfs
And with a love song, the sea
Has calmed my heart
For all my life
The sea
See her dancing
Along the bright gulfs
Ooh la la la…
What have they built…?
- Yeah.
At least there were independent thinkers.
Otherwise, we’d have buildings and hotels
like that everywhere on the coast.
You knew them?
Yeah, I knew them all.
- Oh yeah?
- Sure.
- Dad?
- What?
- Is it far?
- No.
When I was small,
I rode my bike
on this road every day to go to school.
It took my father five years
to let me have a bike.
Five years!
Oh man! That day...
It was heaven.
I was proud!
I rode into the village,
I rode up, I biked around,
I rode back down.
I rode back up,
I biked around the whole village again.
Hey! Look.
Oh, ok.
- Take the suitcases, we’re here.
- This is it?
Dad, will you take my suitcase?
Keep dreaming.
You're really not cool.
- Thanks.
Not cool.
You must've had a beautiful childhood.
You know, childhood,
it depends on the parents.
It's really far from the sea.
It's far from everything.
Now that makes me feel something.
- We’re going up?
- Yeah.
Well, at least it's in
its original condition.
I cleaned when
I came with the lawyer.
The old man lived in two rooms.
Kitchen, bedroom, kitchen.
Like a rat.
Ah! Look at this! Look!
- That, that is priceless!
- Wow!
I swear...
When you're in Paris,
you can't understand.
You're right.
I think the boar's head is bad.
I’m not staying here.
There's no network. Great!
Stop being stereotypes of your generation!
Ugh, fine.
Admit it, having that on the wall...
It's a little...
What?
How do you say “bad" normally?
In French? It's “creepy”.
It creeps you out?
Me, no.
On the other hand, that, behind you...
That creeps me out.
I love guns.
Truly her father’s daughter.
A real Corsican. You see that?
My father gave it to me when I was 14.
- How do you load the bullets?
- Like that. Cartridges.
What are you doing?
Teaching her how to use it?
Am I scaring you?
Hey.
One more floor.
And look at this dust. Disgusting.
- Seriously.
- Yeah.
You could die of heat, too.
This is it, I guess.
Oh, charming.
Anguish...
Nice digs.
- What?
- Come see!
- What?
- There's a rat in the room.
I’m not sleeping here.
- I'm sick of this already.
- He’s dead!
So what? It's still a rat.
That means they’re everywhere.
Disgusting!
Here. Ok, fine.
We’ll buy poison and eradicate the colony.
Really?
You can’t kill Ratatouille.
You kidding me?
Why wouldn't I do such a thing?
Beware!
- Dinner's ready!
- You're an idiot!
You find a network?
"Network unavailable."
This makes me sick.
Damn.
There’s no network...
No wifi, no TV.
We’re going to die.
You’re always in a bad mood!
It's incredible.
Look out the window!
Look at the beautiful weather!
There’s the sea, the Corsicans,
wild boars running in the forest…
Sausages flying!
Come on, damn it!
Let's go! 2, 3, 4 ...
Hey!
Come on, yeah, yeah!
Good...
I called your mother, she’s not picking up.
You have signal?
Yes, on your grandfather’s grave.
Oh, cool!
There’s a grave in the garden?
Sure, the whole family.
No, sorry, Antoine, but...
it's just that between the rat and the grave,
it's the height of creepiness.
- Stop.
You'd prefer we were in the cemetery?
- I respect my elders.
- You don’t respect your father.
I don’t like him.
That doesn’t prevent me from respecting him.
Me, I think it's grim.
These are your ancestors.
They’re not going to be resurrected.
Aren’t you afraid of bad luck?
It’s the only place where there’s signal.
- The connection’s working?
- Yeah, I’m on Facebook.
- Wait, really?
- Look.
Come on, we need to take a
zombie photo on the grave!
Hold on, I'll find Ratatouille.
Shut your mouth!
- Wait, come on...
- Hold on.
Is it good?
- Awesome.
- Go on, did you post it?
There, done.
- Damn, girl!
- What?
- Romain is in Corsica!
- I don’t believe you.
- Look.
- He set his status to "single"!
I'm going to send him a message.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious.
- Hey, alcoholic.
- Hey.
Dad...
Can we go out tonight?
With whom and where?
- With some friends.
- Friends?
- I thought you didn’t know anyone.
I saw on Facebook that some people are around.
- They can pick us up.
- On Facebook?
- Who?
- Our friends.
How are they getting here?
On scooters.
Oh no, no.
Yeah, no.
- Not on a scooter.
- I'm in agreement.
Fuck, Dad! We’re big girls!
Again, without “fuck.”
Ok? You're too
young to die on scooters.
It’s a quick death.
What time are you coming back?
You tell us.
Midnight?
Seriously?
- Midnight.
- Midnight?
We’re not babies anymore.
1:30 am at the latest.
And I’m calling you a cab to bring you back.
Stop being stupid.
What do you say?
Thank you, Daddy.
- Good.
- Daddy... totally.
- Thank you, Daddy.
- No, I’m not Daddy.
Yeah, he's Papi.
Marion, it's me.
There’s no network at the house,
so it's a bit complicated to contact you.
Leave a text if you get this message.
Texting works...
Sometimes... Listen...
Well, I'll call you.
Louna's in fine form.
Sorry I got upset, but...
Well, it was silly.
It's just the first time we haven’t
spent our holiday together.
- Someone there?
Ok. We miss you.
I miss you.
Talk to you later, I hope.
Hey, Antoine!
Oh!
Hi!
Antoine, remember me?
Of course I remember you.
You think?
- Who's that?
- The neighbor, I think.
You came back a little later…
compared to your father.
It wasn’t easy.
You remember when we went
hunting with your father?
- I remember.
- I took you on my shoulders.
You were always embarrassed
about your little nuts on my neck!
- That’s your daughter?
- The brunette, yes. That's Louna.
Hello.
Beautiful as she is, she must turn heads.
No way! What are you talking about?
She’s still a baby.
They used to be married by that age.
And there, that’s Marie.
- Her friend.
- Hello.
She’s the daughter of my friend Laurent.
Hello, how are you?
You don’t have a wife to sweep?
- Yes, yes.
- Mine is coming tomorrow.
- Really?
And your wife, how is she doing?
She's dead, you know.
Two weeks after your father.
I thought I would see you at the funeral.
- You know, work, work…
- Yes, work…
What's his name?
Loukoum. [Turkish Delight]
But yes.
My companion called him that.
I found a young woman.
A Maghrebine.
They’re good, the Maghrebines.
They’re sweet.
- And they make good couscous.
- Ah yes.
But that's not all...
Loukoum, come!
Let's go.
- Hey.
He’s mega-racist, no?
Why?
You see how he said "Maghrebine”?
Maghrebine, that just means
“A person from the Maghreb."
And isn't that just the bourgeois way,
to not call a spade a spade?
It's alright, Dad, relax.
- What happened? He's so serious.
Admit it, it's crazy!
Two days ago, they were a couple!
But how can you go out
with Romain? He's a kid!
He's older than you!
Not mentally.
- I'm sorry, but Romain is smart.
- Smart?
The guy spends his life stoned
in front of his PlayStation.
There are better guys.
- Fine, like who?
- I dunno.
A guy you can talk to,
who can teach you things.
That’s sexy.
Funny, friendly, intelligent.
- Who cares, I didn’t say I was
spending my life with him.
Why not? That would be my dream.
Seriously. Meet a guy,
now, and love each other till the end.
- Stop!
I don’t believe it! Welcome
to Louna’s Care Bears world!
"I’d like to meet my guy,"
"and stay with him till the end..."
Stop! Ouch!
Bring them back at 1:30.
Ok, I'll be there...
But I'm not going to look for them in the club.
They’re not going to go clubbing.
Right, girls, no clubbing?
No, no clubbing.
You’re not going clubbing.
No, we're going to the beach with some friends.
Ange will be there, you call me
if there’s the slightest problem.
There won’t be any problems, Dad..
Then we agree, 1:30 am at the latest.
- Ok, see you.
And if you don’t come back on time,
know what’ll happen?
What?
- Go!
- Kisses.
- Have fun.
They’re annoying, but they’re cute.
True, we're lucky.
He’s really too cool, your dad.
Yours, on the other hand…
sucks. This is the first time
I've had to change in the car.
She vowed to her mother she would
tell her when it happens.
And her mother is going to tell you?
- She's my wife.
- You're dreaming!
You don't understand. Mothers
and daughters, they're like that.
You, as a man, you will always remain
a strange animal, an alien.
A marked man who absolutely can't be trusted.
You talk to her about sex?
- Yes.
- Yes?
- What did you tell her?
- I didn't go into detail.
I explained things,
I gave her advice.
- Can you see me, talking
about contraception, pills...
- It's not contraception
you have to talk about.
You should talk to her about
condoms, danger, diseases.
About protection.
It's our role as fathers
to protect our daughters.
I'm not comfortable with that.
What do you want me to do?
Buy her condoms?
Why not?
First, because...
I don't know, it's women who
have to take care of themselves.
And what are we even talking about?
Louna is a baby.
She's a baby.
Two! Three!
Ah! It's disgusting!
Take it! Take it!
It's us!
- Take it!
- It's us!
What's the matter?
Fuck off!
Stop!
Do you regret getting divorced?
Yeah, of course I regret it.
Not least of all for Marie.
You know, it's always the same
ones who suffer. The kids.
Oof!
However, Marie doesn't seem so bad.
No, but not so good.
There's always some damage.
And then for me,
for years, you build
something with someone,
to end up alone like an idiot.
It's sad.
You'll find someone.
I'm not sure that I miss it.
That's what you think.
That's what you miss the most.
Yeah?
I have that impression.
Here, look.
- Hold this for me.
- What?
- Wait.
- I'm not your slave.
- Wait. Louna!
- Marie.
- What?
Come on, take a picture.
Wait, you take the photo.
- Take our picture.
- It works.
How does this thing work?
But in three seconds!
- Video!
- No, photo, that's good.
- Like that.
- You are wonderful.
You know what,
I love your pink panties.
They're not pink, they're red.
Show us a tit.
- Fuck off.
- Stick out your tongue.
- Do we look dead or not?
- That's perfect.
Marie, if you're dead,
can I make love to you?
Fuck you!
Go fuck your buddy,
I'll take your picture.
- Hey, we saw her ass!
- Yes, bravo!
- Bravo, bravo, I love it!
- What are they doing?
- Relax!
- Have you seen the time?
Relax...
I don't like being betrayed.
You're exaggerating a bit.
She didn't betray you.
Here.
Wait, wait, wait.
On scooters?
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.
- See you tomorrow.
- Ciao!
Shh! Shh!
How's it going?
Are we bothering you?
By scooter!
Didn't we talk about that?
- No scooter!
- And without a helmet!
Didn't I tell you a hundred times?
Oh, Dad...
And what is this outfit?
Well, uh ...
And you're drunk?
- No!
- We're not drunk.
- Yes, yes!
- No.
I'm not drunk, look.
- I've got you.
- That's enough.
That's enough.
- Hold on...
- Oh!
Off to your room.
It's complicated here,
there are pebbles everywhere.
Tomorrow I'm canceling canyoning!
We're arriving at Lovers' Falls.
We'll go two by two.
Who's next?
- Go ahead.
- Go.
Louna, you're going with me.
Dad, it's Lovers' Falls.
You don't love your father?
Yes, but...
You're my father, you know?
- It's beautiful!
- Seriously!
- Come on, Louna.
Are you ready? Let's go.
Come on, Louna.
That's perfect, good positioning.
Push off with your legs.
That's perfect.
- Everything's alright.
- It's ok, it's ok.
Look carefully where you step.
- Something detached.
- Trust the equipment.
- I don't trust it.
- It's fine, it's fine.
Wtach out, it's a little slippery.
- It's slippery...
- Ok, ok.
- Are you still behind me?
- I'm here.
No, calm down. Calm down.
Calm down, calm down.
I'm here, look. Look at me.
Look me in the eyes.
It's fine. Ok?
We'll continue slowly.
- Slowly.
- Let's go.
I'm here, relax. Are you ok?
- No!
- You feeling good?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Not me.
- Are you holding me?
- Don't worry.
One more effort... Ok.
Ok, we're good!
Ah, damn!
You were magnificent.
I'm very impressed.
So, for you, making a point means
spending the holidays separately?
- That's about it. Well, yes.
- I mean, in the dictionary,
"Making a point"
- is not defined as:
"Spending holidays separately."
- No, but I'm asking you...
- And what's this Ibiza business?
- What's this Ibiza business?
- So you had already planned
to leave with your girlfriend.
- You're taking vacations behind my back, you know.
- And I'm alone, dealing with
Louna at my father's house,
- thank you very much.
What's up?
- You chose the right moment.
There's no doubt.
- What, I'm exaggerating?
Are you there or aren't you?
- Well then, I'm not exaggerating.
I'm not yelling, I'm explaining!
Come on, Dad, tonight is
when there's a full moon.
You didn't have to go out last night,
like a "fuck you" to us.
Coming back completely smashed and dressed like a...
I'm begging you!
We're not leaving for three days.
Don't do this to me.
The best DJs on the beach are there, DJ Snake...
- and there will be 2,000 people.
- That's not reassuring.
Marie's right. It sucks.
- Laurent.
- Yes?
Marie's going out?
- Look at her, she's legal.
- There you go. You, no.
In eight months I'll be legal!
In eight months, there will
still be full moons.
You disagree?
Not really, but it's not a big deal.
I have to play the bad guy.
Wait... who's over there?
Is that the chick that
you liked on the boat?
- She's cute.
- Yeah, definitely cute.
Louna!
- What?
- Come here.
If Laurent accompanies you, I'm ok with it.
Really?
Yeah.
Thanks, Dad!
Thank you too...
- Are you serious?
- Why?
I don't care about DJ Snake!
We can't leave them alone on
the beach, or on scooters.
We at least have to control that.
- Ok.
Take my car.
I'll manage.
You aren't playing the victim anymore!
Are you kidding me?
What a hypocrite!
I don't believe it.
- Too cool.
- Seriously.
Oh, no...
We're leaving, this sucks.
Can you give me 20 euros,
please, Dad?
This is for both of you.
Don't get drunk.
We couldn't do much with that.
- Check-in is in one hour.
- One hour?
I didn't say we were leaving.
I want to make sure
you're not drunk.
Ok.
Come on.
You have to stop following me,
or else I'll call the police.
It's you who's following me.
What do you mean?
It's been 10 minutes since
I saw you turn around.
That's because I was thinking...
I hesitated between jam, chocolate...
You're greedy.
Oh yes.
Why's it always the sexy men
who don't want to talk?
I thought, "I'll finish my drink
and then I'll feel her up."
Can I have two gin
and tonics, please?
Thank you.
Did you come alone?
No, I came accompanied.
By my daughter.
I'm on guard tonight.
How much do you charge?
Why, are you interested?
Yes.
I didn't understand
Good evening.
I ordered you a cup.
I gotta talk to you.
Not now, I love the music.
It's your dad, I swear!
- Huh, my dad?
- He scored a chick.
Who cares?
You have to cover for me,
I'm going to Romain's tonight.
She's old, she's...
old and ugly and she looks annoying.
What the fuck is it to you?
Bitch!
Fuck off!
Please, can we leave?
- Huh?
- Come on, let's leave.
We just got here.
- They got me drunk!
- Huh?
Please, they got
me drunk. My friends.
Come on! Fuck!
- Where's Marie?
- Marie's drunk too.
Come on! Let's go, please!
Let's go, Laurent!
I can't go back, I'm drunk.
Let's go, please. Come on.
Let's go, let's go. Please, Laurent!
- Come on!
- Go find Marie.
Good, I'm going.
I thought,
as we kiss,
Why not right away?
Yes! Right away, let's go!
- You're sure of yourself.
- Well, yeah.
You too, incidentally.
I don't know you well enough.
What do you mean?
I don't know, maybe you're married.
You wear a wedding ring.
Yes, well...
My wife and I, right now,
things are cold.
All married guys say that.
For me, it's true.
Would you want your wife to be
in a cafe kissing someone else?
She wouldn't do that, my wife.
You think your women aren't like you.
I know my wife.
They're good, your women.
Wisely waiting at home,
while you dredge
the cafe terrace.
Dad, can I leave...
I can't drive.
We're taking a taxi,
and I won't come home late.
Please, please, please!
You're going too?
I can't leave you alone in this state.
- Go ahead, I trust you.
- Yes, thank you!
Buy me a drink?
- A drink?
- Well, yeah.
Hey!
Sorry, I didn't see that you called.
Where are you?
Huh? What are you
doing in a bar ?
No, but anyway...
I doubt you're alone.
Who are you with?
Who are these new friends I don't know?
No, I'm not spying on you.
But when you ask,
I answer you.
Fine, I'll tell you.
I brought the girls
to eat a crepe.
I'm taking care of Louna
while you're at the bar.
Well, when are you coming?
I said, "When are you coming?"
I can't hear you.
I can't hear you anymore!
Damn, what is...?
That's your wall.
It's the boars.
Damn it!
- Look. It's the wild boars.
- Damn it!
Fucking critters! Damn it!
- Your wall...
- I don't believe it, my wall!
- How many were there?
Oh, damn!
Come on, let's go swimming!
No, I'm drunk,
I'll sink to the bottom.
Ooh...
I'm not sober, but
it feels good to dance.
- Seriously!
- Really, it feels good.
Yeah. You coming?
- No, no.
- Let's go!
Come on!
No, I'm telling you, it's cold.
Don't act old,
you're not credible.
But I am old!
No!
What are you doing? Stop.
If we don't do it with the full
moon, when will we ever?
- No, no.
- Come on!
Hey, I'll do a little dance for you?
- But I don't want...
- Just for you.
Hey, hey!
Stop!
Don't look at me like that.
What?
Come on, move your ass!
No, stop.
Am I annoying you?
It's not that, but...
Hurry up!
What are you doing,
Louna? Stop!
Stop.
- Let's go.
- No, really, I can't...
It'll do you good!
It'll sober you up!
Come on! Come on!
Come on, Laurent!
Don't leave me alone.
- No, honestly, there are jellyfish.
- Laurent!
We only have one life!
One life!
Are you shy?
What's your problem?
Laurent!
Laurent, Laurent!
- Come on, don't leave me alone!
- Ok!
- Attention!
Laurent is undressing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Laurent is removing his pants!
- Laurent is undressing!
What's with that underwear?
"Where's Waldo?"
Stop! Marie gave them to me.
Oh, the shame!
You're going to swim in your boxers?
You think I'm going to strip
naked in front of you?
It's all good, who cares?
Look at me!
But take off your boxers!
It's good, it's good.
Hey! Stop, stop!
Stop!
Are you crazy, or what?
Stop, stop!
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- I'm cold.
Fuck.
You can't do that, Louna.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what came over me.
I'm sorry. Are you mad at me?
No, it's not that I'm mad at you, but...
I can't... It's not you.
Between Mom calling me and saying
not to tell Dad... my head's all fucked up.
- I don't know where I am.
- No, hold on.
- My head's fucked up.
- I know, I know.
I didn't pick up on it immediately.
I should have
put myself in your place.
You surprised me, you know?
I was really surprised.
It's ok.
I can talk to you, you listen to me.
You don't judge me.
No, I'm not judging you.
It's not that.
But...
Put yourself in my place, you know?
Yeah, I know.
When I'm with you,
I feel like nothing can happen to me.
I feel good. Don't you?
Yes, yes, I feel good.
I'm fucking cold.
Oh, damn...
Come on.
It's ok.
Ok, let's go.
Louna, stop.
Hold on...
Stop. No, no, no.
- Louna, stop.
- Just let it happen.
Please, stop.
Louna, please, stop.
Please, stop.
Louna, what are you doing? Stop.
Stop...
- You know, this is the first time.
- For what?
Well, the first time that...
I've been in love.
- Louna...
- I love when you speak my name.
The words that we say with our eyes
Talking seems ridiculous to me
I jump forward and then step back
In front of a useless sentence
Which would break the fragile moment
Of an encounter
I'll tell her the blue words
The ones that make people happy
The motherfuckers!
What are you doing with that gun?
These motherfucking boars are
trying to eat the garden and
my father's grave!
- That's creepy!
Yes, it's creepy.
Where's Marie?
Marie went with...
- She went with...
- She went to a club,
with friends of hers.
- With her friends.
You let things go completely to
hell when I'm not there!
Why do you say that?
Because you're too kind!
- Stop!
- Definitely too nice.
Well, good night, hunter.
Bisou.
Good night.
Good night.
So?
- What?
- At the party!
At the party?
- How was it?
- The party, it sucked, lame.
Lame, really...
Me too, very lame.
You coming?
What you hell are you doing?
I'm coming.
Hello!
- Stop!
- What?
Louna, last night...
It was monumentally stupid.
Really.
- Really.
- When did this start?
No, Louna. Listen to me...
Hello.
They're nice, your pajamas.
Did you get Mom?
Is she coming?
Yes, yesterday.
She won't be long.
Hello.
I love Corsica, Dad.
This air, this sky... The sun!
That makes me happy.
- Not bad, right? Among family?
- Yeah.
Well, what is it?
It didn't go well with Romain?
Yeah, it was cool.
So, tell me! You slept with him?
None of your business.
Are you ignoring me?
Why?
Do I have a reason to?
No, that's why.
I don't understand.
There are also things
that I don't understand.
Yeah?
Like what?
What are you doing with my dad's boxers?
Oh, they're your dad's?
I found them in your stuff.
That must be it.
So, you have 30 volts.
It'll shake him a little. Otherwise,
we have the same in 220.
This, to warn you, will burn the boar.
But at least you'll have peace and quiet.
220.
Hold on.
It may not kill them?
Kill them, no,
but it'll smoke them.
They won't come back.
No, no.
220, right?
No, frankly,
I think it's
a bad idea to have that in the garden.
There are children, animals...
- The neighbor's dog...
- They won't fuck with me anymore.
Wild boars are like women.
Eh?
With a full moon, they go crazy.
I don't see the connection.
When the moon comes out,
worms emerge from the ground.
And the boars trash everything
to eat them.
Just like women.
Yes...
It is true that women...
220. Come on.
Loads of little asses!
If I weren't married...
- It didn't stop you last night.
- I didn't do anything.
What? She didn't want it?
Hey, look.
There, the black two-piece.
- Ah yes.
- Oh, wow.
Oh, that ass! That ass!
Oh la la.
It's a festival.
Where are these
chicks in the winter?
They work. They're
in an office in Seville.
In Paris, you don't see them.
Here we are.
So?
So what?
So, the boars?
220. It'll grill them
like a barbecue.
My father is a psychopath.
Will you rub lotion on me?
I can't reach.
Who, me?
Ask your father.
Oh no, I'm reading.
Here.
- Come on!
- A lounge chair with an
integrated umbrella!
For the beach, it's brilliant.
I'm going to buy it.
Blue, green, or red.
It's awesome.
A zen chair.
Red, blue, green.
There's no yellow.
Where's Marie? It's been a
while since I've seen her.
I don't know, over there.
Where?
I don't have GPS.
Isn't that her talking
to that little asshole?
Who's that person?
What's the deal?
I'm not responsible
for others' actions.
He's much older than her.
It's alright, he's only...
He's at least 20!
You realize he's old!
Ok.
I'm going for a dip.
What did I say?
Wait for me, I'm coming with you.
Can't I swim alone?
I like swimming alone.
Hey, remember, it was in the same
ocean that we kissed the first time.
Yes, but hey!
This isn't a movie, it's reality, you understand?
Go back to the beach.
Wait, wait!
What?
I'm peeing.
- Marie!
- Huh?
- I'm talking to you.
- Yeah.
I said we can have an afterparty at
the house and have some drinks.
Piss off!
A collapsible wheelbarrow.
This is great.
I'm going to buy it.
You don't have anything else to look at?
- Why?
You're right, your catalog is the most important.
Listen, Louna.
Yesterday evening wasn't anything
- Nothing happened.
- What?
Your father is my best friend.
And you're a minor.
You understand that?
Yes, but we're in love.
No, we're not in love.
I don't love you.
It's normal that you don't accept it.
I saw it in your eyes yesterday.
Louna, fuck!
It's not true, honestly!
Making a point,
I can understand.
With effort, but I understand.
Ibiza, I don't understand.
I don't care if you love dancing.
Yes, and you're with that bitch
who could never stand me.
Yes. Well, listen to me carefully.
Tomorrow, 7:40 pm. Figari.
There's a plane.
I'll pick you up.
She hung up.
Damn... but, Lolo.
Am I right or am I wrong?
Listen...
Ibiza, it stinks.
I love that bitch
I don't know what to do anymore.
Listen, Antoine.
I wanted to tell you...
That I—
You really are my friend.
Where do you think you're going, like this?
What's it to you?
Calm down and take it down a notch.
You think you can go out every night?
I don't think so. I'm sure of it.
No. Louna isn't going out.
Antoine isn't going out.
I'm not going out, and neither are you.
You don't need to.
You have everything at home.
What's that supposed to mean?
By the way—
If you're looking for your boxers,
the ones I gave you
for Father's Day,
they're in my room.
I'm going. Good night, Dad.
You're letting her go out again?
She didn't come home late.
You're not even going out in your dreams.
I'm good here.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to sleep with you.
No, go back to your room. Go!
Dad!
Shh! Please, stop.
Shh, shh! Stop.
Shh! You can stay,
but don't touch me.
You promise?
- Hey! Promise.
- Ok.
Stop.
Hey!
- What?
- Get up, Marie's coming.
- Marie's coming.
- It was so nice.
So nice?
I didn't touch you.
To sleep together.
That's what it's like to be a couple.
We're not a couple.
Get to your room.
But I'm in my room.
No, you're in my room.
Now go to your room.
We have to announce our
love to the family.
But... I don't love you.
That's not how it felt on the beach.
I beg you, please—
Go to your room!
If you don't tell me you love me,
I'm not leaving.
She's opening the door...
She's coming up the stairs...
Stop, stop. I love you.
What?
I love you, I love you.
- You're sure?
- Yes.
- Say it again.
- I love you.
I love you, ok.
I love you too.
Go!
Fuck...
I need to talk to you.
I'm tired.
I really need to talk to you.
I don't want to listen.
- It's about your dad.
- Shut up!
I'm in love with him.
Whore!
What don't you understand
about "shut up"?
Let me explain.
Explain what?
You're a slut and he's a pervert.
I'm aware.
But we're in love!
Shut up!
Do you understand or not? Shut up!
Why are you doing this?
Because I love you.
Fuck's sake.
Damn, what
are you doing here?
I'm sleeping. Can't you see?
Why aren't you
in your bedroom?
Why are you asking so many questions?
This isn't possible, this isn't possible at all!
What? What?
What?
Your daughter is speaking disrespectfully to me.
When I say disrespectful,
she talks to me like a dog.
She talked to you about what sort of things...
No sort of things!
She's disrespectful to me!
There are two solutions:
You set her straight
or I do,
but it won't be the same.
No, no, no!
I'll take care of it.
It's true she's difficult.
I think she's on her period.
No. If Louna was talking to you like that,
I'd put her in her place.
- You understand?
- Yes, yes.
Give me two minutes
to find the right time.
The best time is now.
Now.
You want eggs?
What's with Marie?
Any idea?
Has Mom called you?
I can't tell you that.
Oh, Louna!
Yes, but I don't have to tell you.
What did she say to you?
Nothing.
She talked a little about your stuff.
What stuff?
About your separation, finally...
That's new. We're not separated!
We're on a break!
A break during the holidays?
She talked to you about the separation?
I dunno.
She's looking at neighborhoods
to put me in a good high school.
What's this school bullshit?
She thought, after...
I have no idea.
She's planning to move?
It's your business,
don't take me hostage over it!
Am I dreaming?
How can you do this to me?
Still, what's this business?
- It's not true!
- Yeah, Dad.
I won't lie to you.
What's this collusion
between you two?
I'm in the middle.
I'm not against you, it's a
relationship that has always.
Listen, I'm sorry...
Listen to me carefully.
You know what she told me?
Antoine, listen.
Marion wants to move.
That's super...
Are you stupid or something?
No, that's super...
It's super serious.
Of course it's serious!
Why does she want to move?
I'm going to punch something
if she doesn't answer this time.
That's all you told him?
There are other things,
but it's better if you do it.
- This is 100 euros an hour?
- Oh, no!
Half hour.
You think I'm a pinzutu?
Come on, please, Dad!
Yes!
Your mother wouldn't do that.
Thanks, Dad.
- We don't take cards.
- Fine.
I know the type.
Thank you.
The girl has a boating permit?
Nope.
- And do you have one?
- Nope.
No permit, no jet-ski.
- That sucks!
- That's how it is.
Lolo!
Yeah?
You have a permit.
- Yes.
- Don't you want to take her?
Well, no, I wanted to paddle alone.
You know the full moon, Dad,
when I was with Laurent...
At the same time, if the sea
is beautiful, it's the time to jet-ski.
I'll take you.
You can thank Lolo.
Thanks, Lolo.
Thank you.
The killswitch is there,
you accelerate—
Alright, we know.
I knew I need a permit.
- Did you?
- Well, yeah.
- Hang on. You're going to be scared.
- Why?
- Doing ok?
- No!
What's the matter?
- Stop!
- What? What's wrong?
- Stop!
- Hey, look!
Listen!
What, you want to go back to the beach?
Stop, stop!
- It's cool, look!
- No, it's not cool!
- Yeah, it's cool!
- No, not cool!
But it's so cool!
Stop! Stop!
No!
I'll fall off!
May I?
You're already there, so yeah.
Hello.
- Hi, how it's going?
- Hi, good.
Can I talk with you?
I'll leave you two.
He's really good looking, your boyfriend.
You came to tell me that?
No, I wanted to talk.
I can tell something's bothering you.
Very good sense of observation.
If you want to talk to me, or have me
pass on a message to your father,
I can tell him, ok?
Tell him he's an asshole.
What happened?
It is because of your mom?
- Is that it?
Yeah, it's because of Mom.
Don't worry, things will get better.
And I'm here.
You can count on me.
Ok?
- Gotcha!
- You're screwing us.
It's up to me, so, take that!
Nice!
- Come on, play!
- Nice, nice!
I can link.
By the way, Dad,
Any news from Amandine?
It's been a while since
you talked about her.
I liked that girl. Very funny.
Who is she?
Amandine, naughty girl...
I'll grab you in the kitchen—
- We're playing!
Whose turn is it?
- Yours!
Well then, there.
Why didn't you ask her
to come to Corsica?
What's your thing
with Amandine?
I don't know.
It might make you happy.
But... alright, fine.
I'll ask her.
Ah! There's my driver.
I have to go.
Don't leave
in the middle of the game!
There are things where
it's better not to know the end.
Some days, she reminds
me too much of her mother.
Good. Your turn.
I don't want to play anymore.
Ok, then I'm
going to call Marion.
Seriously?
Who's this bitch?
- Who's this whore?
- Calm down.
And mind your own business.
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not your daughter.
You're not my wife either.
Are you sure?
What are—
- I was nice, but it's over.
- You're hurting me!
No! It didn't mean anything,
and it won't happen again.
It's over! Leave me be.
It's been a long time
since you gave me a hug.
I feel miserable, Dad.
Don't worry,
it'll work out with Mom.
I got her on the phone,
it'll be fine.
It's not Mom.
Is it my fault?
No.
Oh...
Oh la la la la...
That's a tragedy, then.
What's happening, baby?
I don't know if I can tell you.
Of course you can tell me!
You can tell me anything.
You know I often
have good advice.
So...
What's happening?
Well...
It's a boy?
Yes, or...?
Yes.
So, what's happening?
Nothing's happening. Not anymore.
Then something happened?
Yes.
You're in love, is that it?
Very.
What do you want me to say?
Love is beautiful.
But it's nothing serious either.
Yeah?
It's serious?
But you haven't
done anything serious?
Why? I told you not to do it
without talking to me.
What, Dad, you wanted
me to text you?
Hey! When did it happen?
- Well, there...
- There when?
There!
Where, in Corsica?
- Yes.
- When?
Here, but... damn!
Tell me. Where and when?
I'm talking about emotions
and you're asking questions.
It's Marie?
One of her friends?
No, not Marie's group.
Who then?
Who cares?
I'm telling you it's over.
What do you mean?
It just started and
it's already over?
- Yes.
You slept with
a boy who dumped you?
Who's the bastard?
He's a good guy, I swear.
Really? A little brat who...
...my daughter, and dumps her?
Yeah, that's a good guy.
He's not a brat.
Oh really, then what?
He's a good guy, a little older.
Even if he's 20,
he's still a little brat.
He's not twenty.
Sorry?
He's a little older.
Thirty? You realize that
thirty is almost double—
Who cares about age!
No, I do care!
How old is he?
Who is this old fart?
He was your age
and he's not an old fart.
Who is this motherfucker?
- You're bothering me!
You're pissing me off, damn it!
- I want to know who it is.
Tell me exactly who it is!
- Mom's right to steer clear of you.
You're a pain in the ass!
- You don't care about me!
You only think of yourself. Fuck!
Not eating?
You're really pathetic.
Marie...
Louna, can I come in?
Leave me alone, I'm tired!
You're pissing me off! Fuck off!
Antoine, I have to talk to you.
Come on, I need
some fresh air.
I need to take a walk.
I'll beat the shit out of him.
Don't talk like that.
Can you imagine? Louna, my baby?
With a 45-year-old.
Imagine for two seconds!
You see...
You can't imagine. Why?
Because it's unimaginable.
I'm fuming.
Did she say who it was?
I'll find him, don't worry.
Trust me, I'll find him.
If you don't know who it is, it
won't be easy. Corsica's big.
It's big, but it's also small.
- And you'll help me.
- What do you mean?
You'll help me.
Ok, but what do you want me to do?
Your daughter needs to know.
Marie? Forget it.
I wouldn't count on Marie.
She'll never betray her friend.
I know her.
I'll go see her,
don't worry.
Let's start
from the beginning.
- Maybe—
- You know what?
One night, you go out with Louna.
- She likes you.
- Oh, no.
Yeah, she likes you a lot.
You can pull it out of her.
Nonchalantly.
They're little girls,
not strategists.
It'll pay off, believe me.
You do that
in front of everyone?
I'm alone.
You know what I mean.
"You know what I mean," he says.
Hey, want to tone it down a little?
Or what?
Or you'll see what!
Really...
You're happy?
Proud of yourself?
What's the matter?
Your father instructed me
to find the fucker
who put his hands on you.
- Why didn't you say anything? It would all be settled.
What are you talking about?
You've got no balls.
You're scared of Dad.
I'm afraid of your father?
Give me my swimsuit.
I think a sausage
got locked in the car.
Is it good?
Yeah.
Everything ok?
Do you like the house?
It's fine.
- And how do you like Corsica?
- I don't know who it is.
Huh?
The guy who you're looking for.
But if you really want to know,
she has a cell phone.
Only you can do this.
No! She knows
I'll tell you everything.
No, you go out with her one evening...
If necessary, you take a little booze.
You earn her trust.
She loves you.
I'll take care of Marie.
Marie's already going out tonight.
Fuck! I don't understand.
How do you let her
go out every night? Shit.
Calm down, it's the holidays.
I'm cool.
There's cool and there's cool.
I'm normal cool.
Hi.
Hi.
Hello.
Doing ok? Can you
watch my stuff?
Of course, baby.
- We're going to play paddleball.
- Sure, sweetie.
Thank you.
Done.
Coming?
What are you doing? Stop.
Don't stoop to that.
- Eh, what do I care.
- No, Antoine, don't do it.
- I'm going to fuck that asshole.
- Stop.
- There are photos, messages...
- Stop, stop.
Shit! There's a code.
Of course there's a code.
- That's normal.
- Son of a bitch.
Her birthday.
Or yours,
or her mother's,
or her dog's...
Damn, that's not it!
Have a little respect.
Her mother's birthday, you're right.
Enter two wrong codes...
You'll lock the phone
and burn bridges
with your daughter.
- Shit.
Damn it...
Come on, let it go.
Oh, fuck you! What would you
do if it were your daughter?
I wouldn't be looking in her phone,
not my ex, not my daughter, not anyone.
It's not right.
Holy shit...
Ok, tonight,
we'll go have a drink,
and I'll fix it.
There.
Fuck...
I don't know
what I would do without you.
- Stop...
It's good you're here.
Thank you.
What?
It's shocking no one
sees we're a couple.
Because we're not a couple.
That's why.
But assume.
What do you believe?
That people think I'm your uncle,
or your father?
- They see we're together.
- Whatever.
- Here, look.
Even on Facebook,
no on cares.
What are you doing
putting it on Facebook?
Are you crazy?
How do you delete it?
Give me that.
Delete it.
You can't put that on Facebook.
You're deranged.
Louna, delete it.
No, that's all
I have left of you.
You want to get me in deep shit?
You'd prefer I tell the truth?
I didn't say that. Your father tried to
get into your phone.
- Seriously?
Without the code, we'd be in trouble.
He's stupid.
My code is too easy.
I'm being serious.
I'm not joking.
He made up his mind
kill the guy who touched you.
- And this guy...
- It's you.
Ah!
If I weren't 17 and I
weren't Dad's daughter,
then could you love me?
That's not the issue.
No, I need to know.
Is it my fault
we can't be together?
Or someone else's fault?
Well...
It's not your fault.
It's a real mess.
That's just how it is.
We shouldn't have.
Louna...
We'll say that nothing happened.
Ok?
I'm almost an adult.
I'll wait.
You'll always be
your father's daughter.
My best friend's daughter.
It sucks to miss the
chance to be happy.
It sucks, but that's how it is.
Life is for doing things you
remember on your deathbed.
He was there, the fucker!
I missed him!
You're shooting in the garden?
You're crazy! It's dangerous!
They started it, those bastards!
The fence is useless?
They ate it!
They don't care,
they respect nothing!
I'm going up to my room.
How was the evening?
Great. You should have come.
It would have changed your mind.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, darling.
Well, then?
- So?
- It's ok. Drop your weapon.
It's alright, I'm a master.
Master of what? Look at you.
Spill it. The evening.
In my opinion, she's seething at you.
Listen, with the state I found her
in this morning, there's a guy.
Not really.
If there is one, he's not 40.
She told me she told you that
to get your attention.
Marie did the same thing
when we divorced.
Don't compare it!
I'm not getting divorced!
But things aren't so strong either...
Yes, good. Fine.
Did you tell you who it is?
No.
- But you asked?
- Yes.
- What kind?
- Lots, lots of questions.
Stop hurrying me!
I asked... I asked her questions,
But I couldn't let
her catch on to me.
Three hours and you couldn't
extract the slightest thing.
One small clue.
A clue? What, isn't there anything...
Anything coming back to you?
A small clue, small...
Well, if you're on the trail,
who are you betting on?
I would say...
Wait, I mean...
I dunno—
The DJ, maybe?
The DJ!
Fuck that motherfucker!
No, wait. I didn't say it was the DJ.
I said, "You can ask the DJ."
Damn it, these motherfuckers!
They think they're musicians,
they put on music.
The girls are fascinated,
it's so easy to—
Fucker! It's him, it's the DJ.
I'm going to kill him.
Antoine
I didn't say it was him...
You're right. It's him.
That guy isn't 40.
- Sure, he's 40.
- No, that guy, he's...
35, tops, I'm telling you.
Antoine...
Tomorrow morning,
I'll get your daughter one-on-one.
I see clearly
how to tackle the issue.
I'll pull it out of her.
I'll bring back information.
She won't know what it's about.
Ok? We'll do it tomorrow morning.
That settles it, let's go.
Come, let's go. Stop drinking.
You're putting yourself in a
ridiculous state. It's ridiculous.
Come on.
Antoine, it's not him.
I feel it.
- Yes, it's him.
- I swear, I have a feeling...
- It's him!
- No, it's not him.
- It's him!
- Look at him...
He's not a horny guy
who fucks girls...
too young for him.
Fuck!
You fucked my daughter?
You fucked my daughter?
What are you doing?
You're crazy! Stop!
I... I don't fuck girls!
I'm gay!
Gay, gay?
Yes, gay.
I don't like girls, I'm gay!
- See?
- You couldn't say that before?
He's gay, it's not him.
It was you who told me
it was the DJ.
It was you who told me
it was the DJ.
Come on, come on.
- It was you who told me...
- It doesn't matter.
- Stop being stupid.
- You told me it was the DJ.
No, that's not true.
- So I invented it?
- I said maybe.
- No...
- I said maybe!
I asked you, and
you said, "It's the DJ."
Calm down.
You said, "It's the DJ."
You're crazy. You're all wrong.
I asked you
twenty times who it was.
You said, "It's the DJ."
I said "maybe."
I didn't...
You didn't say "maybe."
I said, "Are you sure?"
You said yes, the DJ.
"It's the DJ, it's the DJ."
You repeated it.
- Stop! Stop!
You're completely drunk,
and you're all wrong.
Fuck!
Stupid bullshit!
- You're completely sick.
- Yeah, that's it.
It's me who's sick.
- You went there with that?
- Shh.
What?
What?
Stop.
Stop, stop.
Fucker!
It's Loukoum.
No, no.
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?
I wanted to apologize for last night.
- I was being awful.
- It's fine.
No, I wasn't respectful to you.
I swear, I regret it.
It happens to everyone.
It's ok.
Sorry.
Yeah...
It's ok.
I'm coming.
Have you seen Loukoum?
Oh, fuck.
Loukoum?
Who's Loukoum?
My dog.
He's always around.
He would never miss
his breakfast.
I can't find him anywhere.
If we see him, we'll bring him back.
Yes... Oh, you have boars?
They destroyed your garden.
They were in mine too.
We'll start a hunt.
Sure. I fenced it and it's useless.
See you later.
No, but really...
Killing poor animals...
You're deplorable people.
What are you talking about?
What's she talking about?
Fine then. Marie!
Marie!
It's nonstop.
- It's one or the other.
- What?
When it's not one,
it's the other.
I didn't say come in.
Don't talk to me like that.
How should I talk to you?
Like a daughter to her father.
The father
fucking my best friend?
Stop...
I didn't fuck your friend.
That's not what happened.
Sorry.
You made love to her, is that it?
What do you want me to say?
That I'm not proud of it? Yes.
That I feel guilty?
That I'm sorry?
Yes, I'm sorry. Please—
Do you ever think about me?
I think about you all the time, Marie.
And about Mom too?
Mom, leave her be.
I'm divorced.
It's for you that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Marie...
But look at you, you're pathetic!
You try to be the cool dad,
but you're worse than Antoine.
Marie, please...
- I...
- Don't even touch me.
Fuck you!
- Antoine!
- Stop...
You're going to be
working with your friend.
The dogs will track the boars.
- Ok.
- I'm up there with Ange.
Sounds good.
Let's go.
Ibiza...
What?
Ibiza...
Why did I piss her off?
I'm going to lose her...
I swear...
Behaving like shit,
I'll lose her.
I yell...
I yell because
she wants to go
partying in Ibiza.
And I want to bang the crêpe girl.
I'm a shitty person.
We're all the same.
- No...
- Yes.
- No, you, you're clear.
- Yes.
You're clear, honest.
If you have something to say, you say it.
You see how I am.
I'm incapable of...
I'm incapable,
I'm not honest.
You haven't been very clear.
You're not well behaved.
This is true.
You must see that.
It's true you were on the edge.
But I know you.
It doesn't make you an asshole.
No. No.
Antoine, I assure you,
we all have darker sides.
No. When you got divorced...
When you got divorced, I knew very well.
With Virginie,
you would have fights.
You were unhappy.
But you said things.
It was clear, proper.
I'm not clear.
I want to be like you.
- One has to say things.
- Yes.
That's what I mean.
But I don't say them, you do.
Sometimes I try to say things
but I can't, you know?
It's the people who hold the most in
with whom we have the most trouble.
Sometimes, we try to share
something burdening us
and the person, he has other things to do,
he has his own problems. Understand?
Antoine.
Me, sometimes I want...
to confide everything but I feel
like you're caught up in other things.
It's normal. We lug around our...
That is to say,
we're all the same.
We have moments of weakness.
And we regret it afterwards.
Antoine...
There it is!
Antoine... Antoine, it's me.
Ah, damn.
I know. Antoine...
I'm sorry.
Hey! Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it!
I swear I didn't want to!
Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop, please!
Please, stop!
Stop, stop.
Antoine, stop!
- Antoine...
- What?
- Next time, you tell me...
- What?
I don't know why you
beat the disc jockey.
But if you have a problem...
You tell me, eh?
For the memory of your father.
We'll deal with it.
Where's your friend?
- I don't know, he cleared out.
- How's he getting back?
He'll manage.
It's weird, they're not answering.
Well...
Maybe they don't have any signal.
Marie...
What?
I'm sorry.
You can.
Really, it's not his fault.
I wanted you to know.
A little bit, though.
No, it's me.
You know, he's the adult.
We're at a party.
See you later, M & L
- You have arrived at your destination.
- Thanks!
- Bye, Theo.
- See you, girls.
- Rest well!
- Ciao!
Bye, Louna.
What happened?
Nothing.
We were waiting for you.
