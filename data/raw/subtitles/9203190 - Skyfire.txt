Xiao Meng.
Okay.
The snow is burning.
Honey...
Xiao Meng.
Come on! Move!
Move out, everybody!
Go!
Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue!
Answer me! Answer me!
Where are you?
Sue, answer me! Where are you?
Tao, we are by the west station.
You've got to leave the camp now!
Sue, answer me! Where?
Tao, where are you?
Where is Xiao Meng?
She's with me.
Meet me at Parrot Rock! Hurry!
Come on! Hold on!
Mom!
Daddy! Mommy's over there!
Xiao Meng! Xiao Meng!
Nature doesn't love.
Nor does it hate.
It simply builds as it destroys.
No one can predict
the destructive power of volcanoes.
Tianhuo was the fastest-known
volcanic eruption in history.
The Pompeii eruption took place
over twelve long hours.
Tianhuo's cone exploded
in just twenty minutes.
It was incredibly violent.
It blew open,
and superheated gas and ash flew out,
killing anything in its path.
The victims could never know.
One hundred meters to their left side,
or fifty to the right,
would have been enough
to save their lives.
And yet...
today...
it's been turned into a theme park.
The people who put this park
in that spot
are playing a dangerous game.
Passing 60 meters.
Seismic activity is stable.
Copy.
Xiao Meng, how is it down there?
Visibility's good.
- About to place the core sensor.
- All right.
Standing by for data collection.
Hey, so...
you brought your amulet this time, right?
I am setting up the last core sensor.
Check your temp readings.
You're near 1,000 C.
Stop showing off.
We don't need it that close in.
Xiao Meng.
Mommy, I'm scared.
Don't worry, honey.
Daddy will be here any minute.
Xiao Meng.
Xiao Meng,
if you can hear me, answer me.
Last sensor in place.
Xiao Meng!
Are you okay? Say something!
Pull her up!
I'm okay.
Don't worry.
I am pretty hard to kill.
Teng Bo, what's the situation there?
Heart rate normal.
Body temp high, but still healthy.
- How do you feel?
- Come on.
You did well, Xiao Meng.
More like well-done.
She almost cooked herself.
Oh, yeah?
You worried? I can take it.
Now you just sound cocky.
Unlike you, I actually have guts.
Why don't you answer?
You know exactly what he'll say.
Before we finish,
"I am not going anywhere."
If he can see what you've
accomplished here,
he'll be very proud of you.
He won't.
I'm gonna go change.
Xiao Meng! Xiao Meng!
- Yo! The queen bee returns!
- Knock it off.
- Are we online?
- Almost.
I'll be right back down.
Welcome back.
Gather around.
Are we ready?
All these long days and nights
of hard work and efforts,
even brushes with...
Spare us the speech. Hurry up.
Sure.
I humbly, yet proudly present to you...
the Zhuque system.
It's all there.
You finally did it.
No. I just found another way to see it.
Come on. After working on this so long,
it was all worth it.
Mom...
we really did it.
We still need data in the crater
to see the changes in the magma flow.
I got a helicopter.
We go up tomorrow.
It looks like it's waking up.
The hotel will need
an update about this.
They might need to close up shop.
Hey, hold on. Let's go slow.
There are still a lot of things
we don't know yet.
Asking them to close down
isn't all that simple.
So let's wait until
all the sensors are online,
and then we can decide, all right?
We should let Harris know
as soon as possible.
But the data also has to be
definitive, correct?
The Tianhuo Resorts Hotel
is the brainchild
of international real estate
developer Jack Harris.
This colossal resort is
the very first volcano theme park
that sits on an active volcano.
Harris has enlisted a renowned team
of volcanologists as safety consultants,
headed by Professor Jiang
with team members Li Xiaomeng,
Zheng Nan and Teng Bo.
This resort provides
a unique experience...
My God.
Do we have the CO2 readings yet?
The data's cooking.
The best meal takes time in the oven.
Well, hurry up.
We don't have that much longer.
What's the matter?
Something doesn't feel right.
All the data is right there,
and we've double-checked
all of our math.
There's no way it could be wrong.
Then why do I feel like something's off?
What's wrong with this?
Xiao Meng.
I need to speak to your boss.
He just went inside.
We're pitching to investors today.
Harris is pushing the engineers
to start Phase Two,
but the safety advisors haven't
approved the final plans for it.
How's it going?
Still calculating.
Almost done.
Your father called here last night.
He called again this morning.
Xiao Meng...
losing your mother
was very hard for him.
It was hard for me too.
- Hey! Here for Jiahui again?
- You know it. How are you?
Zheng Nan is here!
Come on, sit down.
Have a seat.
Come on.
She's just upset about things at work.
She'll get over it.
Did you find one?
Have a look.
Wow. Looks expensive.
All right, then. This'll do.
What is that?
Jiahui's grandmother gave this to me
when I took my first voyage at sea.
With this, I never got lost.
I always found home.
So I thought maybe you might
get some use from it.
No, I can't.
That was Jiahui's grandmother's.
Now, you wait in the car.
I'll go talk to her.
You know, by "new drone,"
I thought you meant it was
something pocket-sized.
It's got HD multi-spectral imaging,
gravity differential phase meters,
ground-penetrating radar
just for looks,
and a 24-megapixel camera boom,
a gyro-stabilizer zoom.
Good for you.
Do you not find me dashing?
Sure.
But women still can't stand you.
That's why I hit on you!
You knew he was coming.
Xiao Meng.
The volcano is showing signs.
Please come home with me.
There is a boat.
We can be off the island in two hours.
You came all this way
to just tell me that?
It's not safe here!
Well, I'm not leaving.
I am staying like everyone else.
Xiao Meng, don't be stubborn.
I came to bring you back home.
This island is extremely dangerous.
The data isn't confirmed.
Data?
This is a volcano!
Li Xiaomeng, this isn't a game!
All right, stop it! Enough already!
This is your famous Zhuque system?
I don't see surface pressure readings.
Or CO2 readings.
Here.
Tremor foci?
Here.
Magnetic field densities?
Right here.
We've placed almost
1,000 sensor units,
some deep in the mountain.
By this time tomorrow, we'll be able
to see the data updated in real time.
This isn't something people can predict.
All these numbers,
we don't know how they correlate.
That's why we're trying to study them.
It's a volcano.
It doesn't love, nor does it...
It simply builds and destroys, right?
I've heard it so many times.
I'm not a child anymore.
You pull me away from anything
Mom ever cared about.
Xiao Meng...
This is my job. I'm not giving it up.
The chopper's here!
You're going up?
I'm coming with you.
Whatever.
Mommy, hurry!
When my husband first read about
the story of this island,
he had a vision for renewal.
To bring jobs and opportunities
and to create an escape
for today's tourists.
Phase Two provides a new resort
area for young families,
complete with water park
and daycare center.
Do you have any children, Ms. Wang?
This resort is our child.
Shanshan, do you see?
Beautiful, huh?
3, 2, 1, go.
Base Station paging Alpha Team.
Drone is airborne.
Construction took four years.
We should recoup our investment
by the end of the third quarter.
They shouldn't be here.
Neither should we.
Bringing the cable car
through the mountain
is one of our engineering team's
many accomplishments.
This way, please.
The observation deck was built
with over 200 tons of composite steel.
We call it "The Bubble."
It's made from 120 pieces
of ballistic glass
and can withstand the high
temperatures of the magma.
We're standing in what may be
the safest place on Earth.
Once the doors seal, we'll descend
150 meters into the volcano,
which is as close as we can get
to the lava.
This is the service station,
where we monitor the volcanic activity.
Hey, Jiang.
I've never asked you to coddle her.
But of all places!
You had to bring her here?
She insisted on coming here.
Listen to me.
She has a chance
to make a real difference.
- She needs you on her side.
- What?
That's right.
Like I don't support her enough.
What you give her
and what she needs
are two very different things.
How much is Harris paying you for this?
Is it worth it?
If your actions cost lives,
is it worth it?
Hey! What do you mean by that?
So what's eating you?
I found a safety issue
in the Phase Two plan,
but Harris refuses to hear
anything against it.
Seems like Xiao Meng noticed
the volcano acting out too.
Are you all right?
Forget it. I'll be fine.
Well, here we are.
So my grandpa told you?
Hey! Zheng Nan!
What are you doing?
Just jump in!
No one's here. It's just us.
Come on.
The water's perfect.
Fine.
Come on in.
Need any help?
No need. I got it.
I...
I'm not here to challenge you.
I'm just here to make sure you're safe.
If something were to happen to you...
But you were never there.
When Mom ran with me down the mountain,
you weren't there.
The next morning at the hospital,
you weren't there.
At my college graduation ceremony,
you weren't there.
On my first assignment in the field,
you still weren't there.
For every important moment in my life,
you were gone.
And now you say you want me to leave,
so I'll be safe?
That's the difference between us.
You want me to be safe,
but I just want to feel wanted.
So I'm not going back with you.
Finishing the Zhuque system
to monitor volcanoes was Mom's dream.
I don't want anyone to go through
what I went through.
I have to finish this.
Teng Bo, are we online yet?
All crater sensors are online.
But, Xiao Meng,
these new sensors are picking up
movement on the east slope.
Yeah, it's tremors.
What does Zhuque say?
Micro tremors inside the mountain.
Let's get the tourists out.
Call back the helicopter for me.
I'm on it.
Lava is blocking all the exit gates.
There has to be another way
out of here.
There. We need to follow those pipes.
Hurry!
Base Station calling Alpha Team.
Xiao Meng, we've got trouble.
What is it?
More micro tremors in the core.
The drone is picking up phase readings
in the 7 to 8 range.
It's getting hotter.
- Where's my helicopter?
- Two minutes.
Attention, everyone!
You all need to get off the mountain!
Hey, stop that!
Why are you yelling at my guests?
If you don't leave and someone dies,
you'll be liable.
Everyone, listen up!
The volcano is about to erupt!
It's very dangerous here!
Get on the monorail now
and get off the mountain!
Everybody! It's time to leave!
Jiahui, you okay?
You're all right.
Jiahui!
Are you all right? Come here.
We're okay.
Oh, no. Xiao Meng! Professor!
Come back down!
The magma is rising fast!
The mountain is venting.
Professor!
You have to get back here, Professor!
Run, Professor!
Arriving at the island. Ready to land.
Stay back!
Calling base! Tiahuo is erupting!
I've lost control!
Request support! Request support!
Are we safe?
Get up.
Hurry!
Move!
Where are you, Shanshan?
Come here. Don't be scared.
Move. Come on!
Come on!
Go!
Hurry! Hurry up!
Everyone stay calm!
Hello? Teng Bo? Teng Bo?
I'm here! Is everyone okay?
- The volcano has erupted.
- Are you okay?
Many tourists are injured here.
Tell the resort to evacuate immediately,
one at a time.
You get out too!
This is Tianhuo Base Station.
To all vessels in the area,
please respond.
Tianhuo has erupted.
Bring radios and beacons.
Take the skiff and head upwind.
- You're not coming?
- They need me.
This is Tianhuo Base Station.
Calling all vessels in the area.
Please respond!
Xiao Meng, take my hand!
Come on, reach!
Xiao Meng, grab my hand!
Don't be scared. Daddy's here.
Hurry, follow me!
1,2,3, go!
- Come on.
- Jump!
Jump! Go, go.
Go!
This one's forward. This is to brake.
You can do this!
Oh, no! We can't stay in this car!
Everyone to the other car!
Open up!
Open that door! Open the door!
Count the interval!
It's five seconds!
You first!
You come here! Take a breath.
Don't be scared.
Ready?
Don't worry.
Hurry up. Jump already!
Ready?
You have to jump!
We're out of time!
It's too late!
Look!
Let's check.
I don't know. I don't know!
You're all okay?
No chitchat. Let's get out of here.
You still drive this?
That's your dad?
Now we know where you
got that temper.
Get in the car! Everybody in!
Xiao Meng.
I'm here. What's the situation?
Zhuque is sending updates.
The core is shifting fast.
The drones shows a group of villagers
trapped by the lava.
Lava is flowing towards them,
and they have no way out.
My grandpa is in the village.
I have to go get him.
No.
First, we save ourselves.
Let's get you to safety.
Teng Bo, how much time
do we have left?
An hour, max.
That's not enough time.
Lightning, landslides, hot gas clouds,
the surface will be burnt clean.
We have to leave now.
I'm not leaving.
I can't leave him behind.
Who will help the villagers if we leave?
Teng Bo, find us a route
to access the village.
Copy that.
You're crazy.
Everyone hold on.
Come on!
Get out.
My husband...
he's still at the resort.
You take a look at what you've done,
how many lives you put in danger.
This is the consequence
of your arrogance.
It's not a natural disaster.
It's manmade.
Xiao Meng, what's your status?
The magma has
flown through the river.
The roads to the village
have all been destroyed.
The resort guests
are evacuating right now.
You should get off the mountain
before it's too late!
No. If the lava hits the water level,
every person in that village is dead.
We have to find a way
to get them out safely.
What if...
Are the geothermal pipes
linked to the reservoir?
Yes, that's right.
If we could drain
the southern reservoir...
That would divert the blast away.
Teng Bo, you know what I'm thinking?
You want to pump underground water
into the reservoir
and trigger the dam
to open the flood gates.
Where can we find the pumps?
The northwest geothermal station.
- Can you operate it?
- I think so.
I've seen people do it.
But without the key card,
we can't get in.
I have the code.
Famous Southeast Asian
tourist destination,
Tianhuo Island has experienced
a severe volcanic eruption.
The local government has
declared a state of emergency.
There are at least 50,000 residents
trapped on the island,
who are now in mortal danger.
The eruption of Tianhuo
happened without warning...
The number of casualties
is unclear right now.
The world is monitoring
the Tianhuo eruption closely.
Mama...
Mama, where are you?
Mama!
Mama, I'm scared.
Where are you parents?
Your mom was wearing red, right?
Red.
WOMAN
Mr. Harris!
Quick!
Quick!
Quick! Give me the child!
Get in, Mr. Harris!
Don't leave! Please don't leave me!
I can hear it!
A heartbeat!
Teng Bo, can Zhuque see
the southern reservoir?
Yes.
But if we really drain
the southern reservoir,
you know what happens, right?
I know. We'll be right in the blast range.
You sure about this?
What the hell?
Xiao Meng,
I'm picking up something behind you.
The heat signal is huge.
I can't see exactly what it is
through the ash cloud,
but it's moving really fast.
Stop the car.
Lava flow.
Drive! Hurry!
- Hold on tight!
- It's getting closer!
Hurry! Faster!
Oh, shit.
The car's on fire.
That gas can's gonna blow.
Get rid of it.
Xiao Meng, come back!
Hold on!
Xiao Meng!
This is Tianhuo Base Station.
Calling all boats in proximity.
We require emergency evacuation.
Please respond! Please respond!
This is Huaxia calling Tianhuo Base.
We are directly south from you.
We'll be there in about two hours.
Xiao Meng,
a rescue team is on the way.
Did you hear me?
A rescue team will be there
in two hours.
Copy! We're en route
to the geothermal station.
Xiao Meng, you better hurry.
The lava is about to reach the village.
Teng Bo, we are here.
You're out of time.
The magma is headed towards
the southern reservoir.
Jiahui, what do we need to do?
We need to open the release valve.
- That's the release valve?
- Yes, that's the one.
Teng Bo, I need to borrow your drone.
We need it now.
The window on the roof.
Hit it at full speed.
The drone comes with two afterburners.
I'm guessing you want them too.
Go full power!
Roger!
There it is!
Go! Let's go!
We have just received reports.
Water released from the dam
may change the course of the lava flow.
There's now hope
for villagers to be rescued.
However, geologists state
that it is unknown
whether the eruption
will trigger a chain reaction.
Xiao Meng, the volcano
is gonna go pyroclastic!
You need to get away now!
Xiao Meng, can you hear me?
Xiao Meng!
Drive slower, moron.
- Hey, I got it.
- It's the engine.
The ash will clog the radiator.
Yep, it's overheated.
Zheng Nan.
What is it?
I have to go back and get my grandpa.
But we can't just make them
wait for us here.
Then I'll go by myself.
It's not safe. I'll go with you.
How do we fix this?
We're going back to get my grandpa.
We can't just leave him behind to die.
Be quick about it.
We will come and find you
once the engine cools down.
Come on. Let's hurry.
Static electricity
from the carbon in the air.
Mom told me about this when I was little.
Never thought I'd see it myself.
Your mom and I saw it together
once before.
Parrot Rock.
I wish...
Mom was still here with us.
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Hurry.
Grandpa!
Jiahui!
Grandpa.
You are not supposed to be here.
I am here for you.
Jiahui...
We're taking you with us.
I don't think I can walk.
Jiahui...
be brave.
My boat has come for me.
Seeing you one last time
makes me so happy.
Zheng Nan.
Grandpa, I'm here.
You must take Jiahui to safety.
Take good care of her.
I will.
Let's go. Let's go!
Zheng Nan.
There's no way out of here.
I'm right here.
We'll find a way.
- Get in the car!
- Go. Hurry!
Xiao Meng, the lava
is approaching Base Station.
Where are you guys? Respond!
- Damn it.
- We're stuck.
We're burning!
Lift up your feet!
Come on! Do something!
Do something!
I got this.
Be careful!
Reverse! Reverse right now.
Zheng Nan, hold on!
Everyone, hold on!
We're going to fall! We're falling!
Everyone out!
Give me your hand!
Hold on! Give me your hand!
Don't look down!
You go first! I'll follow!
This is Huaxia!
Tianhuo Base come in!
Tianhuo Base come in!
This is Tianhuo Base.
Copy. Go ahead.
Helicopter ETA, 15 minutes.
We'll touchdown on the south beach.
Copy. Xiao Meng...
Right here!
Get me a medical kit. My dad is hurt.
Coming right up.
Open your hand a little more.
We're almost done.
There.
Forgive me.
I was so scared.
So was I.
I've always regretted...
that I wasn't there with you two.
I never imagined
that what would happen was...
First thing the next morning,
I went to look for her,
and I swore I would bring her home.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I wasn't with you.
I've already lost your mother.
I can't lose you too.
Dad...
Been a long time
since you called me that.
Xiao Meng, she's about to blow!
Leave everything behind. Leave now.
Go across the bridge!
Run! Keep running!
Hurry! Go!
Hurry!
You first! I'm right behind you!
Professor, hurry!
Don't wait for me!
Dad!
I'll get the helicopter.
We'll be back for you!
I'll wait for you.
Xiao Meng, there's no time!
Hurry up!
Dad...
We should go!
Dad, wait for me!
Xiao Meng, there's no time!
Come on!
Let's go!
Calling Tianhuo Island!
The island is in front of us.
Landing in five minutes.
- Hurry!
- Come on!
Keep up!
Hurry!
My dad is at Base Station.
I have to go save him.
It's too dangerous now!
I need to go back! I need to go back!
- Xiao Meng!
- Let me go! Let me go back!
Calling Huaxia!
We're returning to Tianhuo Base Station.
We've encountered further eruptions.
I repeat, further eruptions!
It's my dad!
Dad!
I am sorry about this, Dad.
You shouldn't have come for me.
I'm sorry.
We continue with more breaking news
from Tianhuo Island.
After the volcanic eruption on Tianhuo,
volunteer rescue teams
from nearby communities
are mounting the first
emergency search for survivors,
bravely fighting to save lives.
The national government
and neighboring countries
have rapidly formed
the rescue response framework,
with rescue teams being
dispatched to Tianhuo Island.
So far, work has gone smoothly.
You still have me.
Everything will be fine.
Excuse me, can I see your watch?
The man who gave you this watch,
was he on the same boat with you?
For the moment, there have been
no official announcements
of further alerts or warnings,
but the volcanic ash cloud
from Tianhuo Island
has been expanding rapidly.
Air currents are spreading the ash
in the stratosphere.
It's all gonna be okay.
We'd like to show the footage
we've just received.
This was shot by the Huaxia
Insurance rescue team
during its search of the area.
Xiao Meng, look!
People's lives have been
forever changed by this disaster.
Nothing will ever be the same again.
Here we see the rescue team
has located a survivor.
It's him, the professor!
He's still alive!
He's still alive!
Stay tuned to this channel
for the latest reports from Tianhuo.
Where is it?
Come on! Come on.
It's gotta be there,
but where, where?
Daddy!
Your Zhuque system...
helped me find a safe lava tube,
where I hid from the blast.
You saved me.
I thought I was gonna lose you too.
Not a chance.
I'll always be right here.
Right by your side.
