I am the wanderer,
always searching.
You are in me
and I in you,
and we will meet again.
I cannot be tricked,
I cannot be fooled.
I am the wanderer
and you are mine forever.
These mountains look so scary.
You know it's believed
that the mountains
are a back of a snake.
It lies sleeping on its stomach
and after the rains you can see
the scales reflecting.
And that's how
a rainbow is created.
And every once in a while the
snake will poke it's head out
and if you look very carefully
you can see it.
Don't scare the child
with stories like that.
I'm not scared.
Snakes aren't bad.
In most beliefs they're
bearers of good luck.
And what beliefs are these?
Some African cultures.
They say that snakes carry souls
to the afterlife.
I don't know where
she gets this.
I read it in a book.
That's a clever girl.
SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH AFRICA, 1977
Well, here we are.
Just look at this place.
It's been a long, long time.
It's very dark.
You stay here, I'll go inside
and look for a light.
For God's sake, be careful.
William?
Where are you?
Can I have the candle, please?
Be careful.
You can have my torch.
Okay.
Whoa.
Mary, shit.
Mary!
Mary!
You okay?
What's wrong,
what happened?
My candle blew out.
Why did you wander off
like that, you scared me!
Come.
Let's go back to the car
and wait there where it's safe.
Will, fix up a room
or do something please.
Yes.
You have returned.
So this was my granddad's farm
I keep telling you about.
What do you think?
I love it.
How was it living here?
Oh, it was like any normal farm.
My father would get up early
for work, you know.
Before the sun came up.
Sometimes I wouldn't see him
until the sun went down.
Did you have any friends?
Yeah, some of the local boys
from the village came to play.
There's a village
next to the farm.
Some of their fathers
worked here.
There was one boy in particular,
think his name was...
Siya or something.
His dad was the local
witch doctor.
You mean a Sangoma?!!
How do you know that?
From school.
Wow!
Sangomas can
talk to your ancestors...
who are like ghosts,
but friendly.
Although sometimes
they can get angry.
That's just superstition, Mary.
It's not just superstition
Aunty Sarah, it's real.
Okay, enough about
ghosts and Sangomas
before we all get nightmares.
Lots to do tomorrow,
so get into bed.
- I want to...
- No, no, no, no,
plenty of time
for that tomorrow.
Fine.
Look what I found.
What's that?
Hmm.
It's my dad's old boots.
They're a bit big.
Well done, finally following
in your father's footsteps.
Okay, I'm gonna go see
what's going on around here.
Try and get
that generator started.
At least
we'll have some power tonight.
Can I come with?
You have to stay and help Sarah.
I'll take you for a tour
later, okay?
Promise?
Promise.
Mary?
Mary?
My mommy's room!
Wow!
All these things
belonged to her,
what amazing treasure!
I want to sleep here tonight,
can I?
Please?
I don't know,
it's a big house.
Will you be okay here
all on your own?
Oh, look at you.
Come here,
let me fix your face.
Pssssst!
Pssssst!
If I can just
get this bloody thing to start.
What do you know about
machinery, Mr. Accountant?
I'm trying okay?
What's in that shed?
Will?
Hmm? I don't know, it's locked.
You know, it's not nice to sneak
up on people...
Are you lost little Miss?
Don't hurt them.
Please, sir.
I gave them something to eat.
Thank you, sir.
Is it dead?
Oh, yes little Miss.
It's been dead for a while.
Look closer.
In fact it's alive,
and budding alive.
So you see here...
death is life...
and life is death.
This maggots that you see here,
they need a body to stay alive.
They are not different
from your worms.
They eat from something
and then they
turn into something.
My worms will turn into moths.
My name is Lazarus.
I'm Mary.
Oh, very nice to meet you, Mary.
So...
what are you doing here in the
middle of the forest, all alone?
I just moved to a farm nearby.
I was looking for some food
for my worms.
Would you like to meet them?
Oh, yes please.
These are my worms.
This one's Tiger 'cause it has
all the stripes on its back.
Oh, hello Tiger.
This big one's Mr. Grumpy,
'cause he always
has a grumpy face.
This one's Toto,
William, and Sarah.
And now they will weave
themselves cocoons.
And transform
themselves into moths.
Yes, but they will
never leave me,
'Cause they're
my friends for life.
Can you help me
get back to the farm?
I think I'm lost.
William! Hey!
Mary! Get over here!
Who are you!?
This is Lazarus.
- Quiet, Mary.
- We met in the forest.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I...I didn't mean
to cause any alarm...
I was working for Master Ziel.
Is he here?
Can I help you?
A very good day to you, sir.
My name is Lazarus.
I used to work for your father.
Master Ziel.
Yeah, well, he's passed away,
what can I do for you?
Well, I found this one
wandering in the middle
of the forest, sir.
What? I told you
not to go so far.
It's dangerous out there.
I'm sorry, my worms were hungry.
As I mentioned before,
I used to work for your father,
well, if...if you want any help
- I am glad to...
- Thank you, Mr...
Lazarus.
Lazarus, sorry.
We don't need anyone
at the moment.
Um, yeah, it's a little
too soon, we've just moved in.
But, um, thank you
for bringing Mary back.
Here you go, Lazarus.
Thank you, sir.
Ma'am...
I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to cause
any alarm.
Very pleased to meet you, Mary!
Bye, Lazarus.
Mary, if you ever bring
strangers to this house again
there will be trouble.
We're miles away
from the nearest police station.
Relax. He brought Mary back.
He says he's worked here before.
He's just a nice friendly man.
That's enough, Mary, go inside!
Why do you always
have to be so hard on her?
And we could have done
with the help.
You fixed it!
That's strange.
I'm just gonna go check
something, stay here.
Hey!
What's going on?
Hey. Sir.
It's no good
to have no power, sir.
I saw that you were having
some problems,
so I thought I could help.
What did you do?
The diesel filter, sir,
it was dirty.
That is why there was no diesel
going into the cylinder, sir.
So I cleaned it up.
But I could've sworn I did that.
Well, it's working now, sir.
Thank you, Lazarus.
No problem, sir.
A very good night to you sir.
Lazarus?
You said you used to work
for my father, right?
I'm letting him stay
in the shed.
You did what?
He fixed the generator, Sarah!
I couldn't just let him walk off
in the dark. Who does that?
Plus there's a lot to do around
here, I need help!
No!
He leaves tonight.
What is up with you, Sarah?
He brought Mary back!
He's worked here before
for Christ sakes!
- And he's handy!
- There's something about him
I don't trust!
Oh, Sarah, please.
Mary wants to sleep
in her mother's room.
The bulb's are blown;
I'll have to put a candle
in the passage.
Do you think she'll be okay?
She'll be fine.
Sweet dreams my girl!
You know where we are,
you can come to us
any time you want, okay?
Don't worry,
I feel safe in my mommy's room.
I'm sorry I yelled at you today,
Mary.
It's just my mother told me
never to talk to strangers.
And when I saw you
with that man...
- Lazarus?
- Lazarus.
I panicked.
I'll protect you.
Something wrong?
Sarah?
Nothing...
I was dreaming.
You okay?
Yes... Go back to sleep.
He is back, he is dangerous...
The question is
when is he going to strike next
Obara, respectfully, I do not
understand what you are saying.
We have to sit
like pigs in a cage
and wait
for the serpent to strike?
And tomorrow we wake up
and find another gone?!
I don't understand.
The way to catch a snake
is to be patient,
you have to anticipate
its every move.
Understand the way it thinks. B
doing so, you prepare to strike
Move too soon and
you lose an eye...
He is not a snake he is a demon
A demon who eats the souls
of our loved ones.
Our mothers and our children!
Lazarus,
is but a man, wrought with
pain and suffering,
no man should ever have to
endure that kind of suffering.
In desperation,
he allowed the devil in.
And we have to suffer
the consequences!
this is what happens when
you try to resurrect the dead.
Why didn't you try and stop him
Laaaaazarus...
Laaaaazarus...
Who's there?
Show yourself!
I cannot see you!
What do you want
Lazarus ?
Tell me what do you want?
I want my daughter.
I want to hold my baby girl.
It was too late.
There must be a way
to stop this!
Lazarus simply used to be a
father who loved his daughter.
Vuyiswa!
Mary...
Is that Mr. Grumpy?
Yes.
He died last night.
Oh...
Mary I'm so sorry.
I want to bury him
But he's just a worm.
Maybe I should just
throw him away
No Mary!
You see, this little worm,
so small and insignificant,
has got the same spirit as you.
Inside was something
that can never die.
But everything dies,
my parents died.
I saw them die.
Yes, Mary!
But something was left alive.
That something
floats around like a little moth
and gets carried away
by the wind...
to somewhere...
Somewhere very far away...
Mary...
do you want to bury it?
Okay.
Bring it here.
I like that.
I miss my parents sometimes...
Mary,
I want to show you something...
come with me.
Be careful.
Wait here.
Whoa!
These two,
ah, they are my favorite.
I found them flying all alone,
flying next to an open road.
It was sunset and
the air was crisp.
I chased them
for a very long time.
I want you to have them.
Really?
I can have them?
They're yours.
Mary?
I have to go.
Hide it.
It will...
it will be our secret, okay?
Where were you?
Nowhere... I just have to go
to the bathroom quickly!
Will!
- William!
- What?
There's a man watching me!
Must be from the village.
Lazarus, who's this man?
I don't know, sir.
There is a small settlement
on the edge of the farm.
There were people living there
when I was here.
Maybe he's one of them.
I don't like the idea
of shady people hanging around
then running away
when they see us.
Maybe you should go to the
village and introduce yourself.
I think it's important.
I'll take Lazarus with me,
he can help.
Yes, sir.
Okay, you wait here,
I'll go talk to them.
Yes, sir.
Greetings!
How are you?
Um, how's everyone?
Fine, thanks. And you?
What's your name?
My name is Obara.
How do you do?
I'm very well, thank you.
I'm looking for, um,
Mbu and Zan-em-vula?
Do they still live here?
We play used to play together,
I'm from the farm, next door.
My name is William.
They are both dead!
It's you.
How did you get here so fast?
What were you doing on our farm
spying on us?
No. No, no, no, no, no.
His name is Suno.
He is our scout.
He just wanted
to see our new neighbor.
You are asking a
lot of questions!
You are not welcome!
- Leave!
- Leave!
I'm so... I don't understand.
I think... you better go now.
But we come in peace.
Uh, get in the car, sir.
It's much safer.
I'll talk to them.
What are you doing here?
Go away demon!
Who do you think you are boy,
threatening me
with your simple tongue!
Be gone!
Be warned,
sleep with your eyes open!
You complete your business
with the white man.
We will not intrude,
you stay away and we will leave
you to your evil business!
Be gone!
Listen to this one-eyed man!
He knows what happens
to those who don't obey.
Your eyes are not
the only things you will lose.
Let's go, sir.
What the fuck was that!!??
Superstitions, Master William.
What did I do to upset them??
I don't know.
They kept mentioning
your father.
My father?
What about him?
I don't know, sir.
These people, they don't like
intruders on their land.
They have a feeling you want
to take their land
away from them.
But we can help each other.
We can work the land together.
Don't get to close to them, sir.
They will take advantage of you.
I think it's best
we don't tell Sarah
anything about this, okay?
Yes, sir.
Are you enjoying it here?
Yes, it's nice.
You and Lazarus
are getting along, I see.
He's friendly.
And what do you to talk about.
Things.
What things?
He knows a lot about nature,
like worms and
butterflies and stuff.
I see.
He said that moths and
butterflies can piggyback
the souls of humans
once they've died.
He said that my mommy and
daddy's souls are resting
in two big beautiful moths!
And where are these moths?
Can't say.
Do you believe this?
Maybe.
Well...
bedtime for little girls.
Do you ever wonder why...
Why what?
Why, you know,
we cannot have our own.
Prefer not to think about it,
no.
I just accept.
Yes, well...
it's something to worry about.
Why I cannot give you anything.
I'm like a dead tree
without any purpose.
- Please don't.
- It's true.
Why did God do that to me?
Curse me with a rotten womb?
Sarah, please.
I want a child of my own.
You have a child.
A lovely little girl.
She's not mine.
She'll never be mine.
Your stubbornness
will keep you bitter forever.
I'm hungry...
It's not time yet.
You are getting too
close to her.
You are neglecting me.
That's how I gain her trust.
I need her now...
You know it's not the time yet.
Give me something
to satisfy my hunger.
There is no one.
Go to the village...
You want too much...
You don't love me anymore.
Stop that! Be quiet.
I will go to the village.
I will get you your food.
- What's wrong?
- There's something in the yard.
Something strange.
No, it's nothing.
Maybe just a jackal
or something.
No, it's not,
it's something else.
It's too tight.
- Shall we take a break?
- Yes.
So where are you from Lazarus?
Not far from here.
A village on the foot
of the mountain.
So, do you have any uh...
wife, family, kids?
I had a wife and a little girl.
Both dead.
My wife died while giving birth
and then there was a fire.
I couldn't save
my little girl...
I have been wandering
ever since.
And that's when you came upon
Hemel-op-Aarde?
Hemel-op-Aarde, as you call it,
is a very special place.
It's a... it's a place
where we believe that
there is a crossroad here.
My culture
believe that this is where
we can communicate
with the ancestors.
So what, you telling me that
you speak to dead people?
We all have ancestors,
Master William.
So what, ancestors are a pretty
big deal for you, huh?
Well then, this must be a
powerful place for you.
Do many people know?
Not many people know.
Only those who are chosen
by the ancestors.
Were you chosen?
In my village, I was a healer.
A man who can communicate
with the unknown.
I have a rare gift,
Master William.
After the death
of my daughter...
this gift became a burden.
You guys
just keep on getting bigger.
If you keep eating so much,
you're gonna turn into moths,
like the ones Lazarus gave me.
He's a very friendly man.
Have a good rest, Lazarus.
Yes, sir.
Be quiet mother...
Quiet mother...
I hereby pay my debt...
Quiet mother, it's over.
It's done.
Sarah, can I come in?
Sarah!
What's wrong?
Sarah!
Something tried to kill me!
No, no,
nothing's tried to kill you.
- Nothing's tried to kill you.
- Something tried to kill me.
Nothing is trying to kill you!
You're just stressed,
you're just stressed.
It's all in your mind.
It's all in your mind.
It's all in your mind.
Calm down.
It's all in your...
It's not in my mind, it's real,
it's real, it's real, it's real!
Hello?
I have to get that water pump
working today.
Can't keep bringing up water
from the dam.
And without that,
we can't sell this place.
I don't know, I'm...
I'm starting to like it here.
Thought we could move here.
Don't be ridiculous.
What? Some cows, some chickens.
You can milk the cows
in the morning.
Mary can fetch the eggs...
You have it all figured out,
don't you?
Yeah, all figured out
in my head, yeah.
Well, stop daydreaming
and fix the pump.
Well, Mary thinks it's
a good idea, hey, Mary?
I think it's a great idea!
Good!
Okay. Today,
I get that pump working.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna go find some food
for my silkworms.
It was him...
I felt his presence last night.
We did warn him.
Warning doesn't keep
evil at bay .
I don't care, evil or no evil,
this has got to stop!
I have a plan...
He carries that sack
around with him.
We grab the sack, we grab him,
destroy the sack, destroy him.
Simple.
You are playing with fire!
We have to wait for
the right time.
I am done listening to you.
Don't tell me what to do,
I don't need you permission.
That's my mother!
My mother.
Sleep mother...
Sleep mother...
I will avenge your death.
Sleep now mother.
Sleep.
Psssst.
Would you like to see my worms?
Mary?
...and that one is Sarah.
Toto's over there in the corner.
I had another one
called Mr. Grumpy,
he died a few days ago, though.
But it's okay,
I buried him in the field.
Hey! Who are you talking to?
What are you?
Don't be scared...
Come here...
Come here...
Come here you evil spawn!
Come here!
Look what you made me do...
You had to . He would
have killed me !
Maybe I should have let him!
If you plan on killing...
you have to do better than that
Demon!
I'm not a demon,
I'm the ghost of a father.
Her death was not your fault!
I can give you peace.
Peace... never.
All your curses can be lifted.
Burn me... burn everything.
Burn you...
You turned me into a murderer.
I can't do this anymore.
Can't it be someone else?
It has to be her...
She must be the one...
Then it will be tonight.
William!!!
I told you there was something
wrong with Lazarus.
There's something very wrong.
Not this again.
I told you to leave this be.
Lazarus has a girl
he keeps inside a bag.
Will, trust me,
you have to let him go.
There's something very wrong.
There's gotta be
a rational explanation for this.
He's a murderer and
an evil man.
I think you need a rest.
I need him here.
We need him here.
William, you go and tell him
right now, so help me...
If you don't, I'll take Mary and
you will never see us again.
What are you talking about?
Lazarus isn't a murderer.
Mary, listen I know what I saw.
No! finally there's someone
I can talk to,
- someone who listens!
- Mary, that's enough.
I think you should
listen to her.
William,
you go down there and tell him.
Mary, you come with me.
I'm warning you.
Stop being so pathetic
and take some responsibility
for what you've done to us.
Lazarus, I'm sorry but
we're gonna have to let you go.
It's... Things aren't
working out, and...
Well, we gave it a good shot.
I've got some...
Here's some money, just...
Please take it and... it'll
help you get back on your feet.
You cut your hand.
Oh, yes...
but it will be okay, sir.
Master...
I just want to thank you
for giving me a chance.
But please, sir,
I don't want your money.
I just want to only ask you
if I can stay a night.
Of course, stay the night.
I just want to thank you
personally
for all the hard work.
Lazarus, I hate to ask but can I
have a look inside your bag?
Huh?
I'm just curious.
Of course, sir.
The diesel is finished, sir.
I wanted to go and
get some more.
No. You stay.
And stay the night.
You've had a rough day.
And look after that cut.
I'll get some.
No apologies, sir.
Family comes first.
His hand, Sarah.
He cut his fucking hand!
Do you have any idea how
embarrassing that was for me?
He's gonna stay the night,
and he will leave
first thing in the morning.
That's not good enough.
I want him out now!
Well then, you do it!
'Cause I'm no longer playing
a part in your paranoia!
I'm getting diesel
for the generator.
Then I will do it.
Mary.
Mary are you here?
Lazarus? Is that you?
Mary...
come with me.
I want to show you something.
Where is everyone?
They went to fetch fuel
for the generator.
They will be back soon.
Come with me.
Bring your silkworms with.
Hey guys!
Where are you?
Mary!
Sarah!
What have you done with them?!
Where are they?
Stop the singing.
Stop the singing!
Stop the singing!
Stop your singing!
He has taken her.
The one you call Lazarus.
What are you talking about?
What's going on!?
Sarah!
Sarah!
What's going on?
Sarah, look at me.
Talk to me!
Ahh fuck!
I'm sorry, this is all my fault.
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.
Sarah.
Sir!
You've got to listen to me.
Mary! Where's Mary?
There's no time to waste!
Your family came across a demon.
With the name of Uthuli,
collecting souls,
helped by Lazarus.
Mary's in grave danger.
What's Uthuli?
Go with our tracker!
Fetch Mary!
And bring her back!
I will stay here with your wife.
Go! Now!
Where is she?
Where is she?!
He's taken her.
You tell me where she is right
now,
or I'll blow your fucking brains
across my yard!
If you pull the trigger...
the rest of your family
will be lost.
Mary needs you William!
You must go!
You better not be lying to me,
old man.
I'll be back.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'll be back. I'll be back.
Bring me the goat.
How do you know that song?
The song?
You're always humming it.
I used to sing it for my
daughter before she fell asleep.
Where is she now?
She is asleep.
I lost her quite a while ago.
Looks like you need a daughter
and I need a parent.
Give me your hand.
Go like this.
Now repeat after me.
I promise to take care of you
whenever I can
and to never hurt you.
That's a big promise.
I don't think I will be able
to keep that promise.
I promise I will take care of yo
whenever I can...
and never hurt you.
Now shake.
Now we'll always be together.
Drink up.
We're going to see the stars
at their brightest tonight.
Let darkness subside
and light enter!
They say the stars
are the souls of people
who passed before us.
Looking down at us...
peering through
the dark curtain...
and they remind us...
that they are still here.
Sleep now child,
your work here...
is done.
Forgive me...
I am here,
steady the goat!
- W-why are you stopping?
- Ssshhh!
I thank you
my ancestors, thank you.
Dark and poisonous spirit!
This is not your place...
leave now and
let us never see your face...
Go away evil! This is not
your place, we will kill you!
Thuli...
My debt is paid...
What have done???
Sorry...
Wake up!
Wake up!
Sarah!
Sarah!
My head hurts.
Don't worry,
it will go away soon enough.
This isn't my farm...
You're right,
this isn't your home.
Where are we?
We are somewhere
and nowhere.
In a world between worlds.
A place of emptiness...
and isolation.
But I don't understand,
I was sitting by the fire,
and I fell asleep...
Yes, you did.
You fell asleep in one world
so that you can wake up
in this one.
Come here.
I want to show you someone
over there.
Mom? Dad!
What's happening?
- Mom!! Dad!!
- Calm down.
- Where are you going?
- Calm down.
Come back! No!
- Hey! Calm down!
- Let me go!
- Calm down!
- Let me go! Leave me alone!
Listen to my voice!
Listen to my voice!
Close your eyes,
close your eyes!
Listen to my voice.
Close your eyes.
What do you see?
It's my old house.
I remember that day.
Aunty Sarah?
Mary?
Now you have to make a decision.
This is you, Mary.
This is your soul.
Now you have an option
to go with your parents,
or to return to the real world.
Why did you do this to me?
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry, Mary.
This was the only way
to save my daughter Vuyiswa.
I'm sorry...
I betrayed you.
I'm sorry I broke our promise.
I'm sorry...
I broke your promise.
What's gonna happen to you?
Maybe these rocks will
have sympathy on an old man.
Don't be afraid, Lazarus.
Mary?
You gave an old man
a beautiful gift, my child...
Give me your hand.
Repeat after me.
I promise to never forget you...
I promise to never forget you...
I promise
that one day we'll meet again.
I promise
that one day we'll meet again.
And shake.
Thank you.
I'm pregnant.
What!?
How?
I don't know...
I'm pregnant!
Afternoon...
Seems to me
you gonna need help here?
Thank you...
we're getting there hopefully.
I'm sorry for your daughter.
She's not my daughter...
but we'll manage...
and we'll miss her.
But with your help, we can turn
this place into paradise...
The good tree
bears rotten fruit.
I am the wanderer,
always searching.
You are in me and I in you,
and we will meet again.
I cannot be tricked,
I cannot be fooled.
I am the wanderer...
and you are mine...
Forever.
