Ananta!
Master!
Which month is it?
Falgun, Master.
Is it spring?
Yes, Master,
the "muchkunda" are in bloom.
Do you want some?
Ananta!
Master!
Where does that music come from?
From the Ganguli's place.
Where?
From Ganguli Babu's house,
Master!
Go and fetch the steward.
Yes, Master!
Pessanna Babu!
Pessanna Babu!
Lord Roy is calling you.
Who?
Master Roy! He's on
the terrace. Hurry up.
Why is the Shehnai
played at Mahim's?
For his sors initiation,
Master.
Is it the Shehnai
of Bande Ali?
Yes, Master.
Have I been invited?
Yes.
Did he come in person?
No, Master.
A written invitation.
Will you go?
Am I going somewhere?
No, Master.
So?
I've brought your syrup.
Put it there.
The initiation.
A letter from the bank.
What do they say?
They say...
No credit?
No, Master.
They say the overdraft
already exceeds...
...the limits of
banking payment.
Master!
Mahim has come to see you,
will you receive him?
Mahim?
Janardan Ganguli's son, Master.
This usurer's son?
He wants the exploitation rights
for the river sandbank.
Him?
Yes, Master. He's rich.
A business in town,
a house in the village.
Really?
Will you accept to hear him?
The coffers are empty,
spending is important...
Call him!
In the music room.
Come in.
You are the son of
Janardan Ganguli?
Yes.
What did you put in the syrup?
Some muchkunda petals.
It's perfumed.
You took over the business?
Which rate?
What?
If you work on
Roy territory,
you'll have to abide
by some rules.
Yes yes, I know.
Maximum monthly interest is 1%.
Nothing on overdue taxes,
no seizure,
never bring a lawsuit.
You know that?
I know. We remember
your kindness, Master.
Where have you been before?
I spent almost 20 years
in the west,
Allahabad, Konpur, Lucknow.
Me too, I like music.
I attended musical
parties there.
I can play the percussion,
if necessary.
You can go.
Go?
Will Durgabai come?
Invitation cards have been sent?
Yes, the usual ones.
To Mahim too.
At your service... but...
Usurer's money can't
be used to pay
the initiation ceremony
of my only son.
- Do you have another choice?
- Yes.
The jewels of the Roy family
are still in the safe.
What's happening?
Are you angry?
There's nothing left now.
Yes, my jewels.
Your jewels?
They're mortgaged
but I'll buy them back.
Old fool, do you know the cost
of your last musical party?
The cost?
We have to spend money.
Khoka is my only son.
Am I going to cut down
on his sacred initiation?
My prestige depends on it.
But... mortgaging in
order to pay the singer!
This girl is exceptional.
Her beauty, her voice...
you'll know when you
listen to her.
No, I won't.
Where are you going?
It's 3. I'm going to bed.
Khoka sleeps alone.
Stay a while.
What is it?
What's the problem?
Close the music room.
Why?
I'll be deprived of music.
Music.
A crazy passion of yours.
That becomes one
of your son too.
He neglects his work because
of music, only but music.
And now he wants to ride.
Why do you worry?
He'll ride Tufan.
He'll hunt on Mati.
If not, how could he be
a landowner from Roy lineage?
Landowner? What's left?
Everything has been swept away.
Haven't you seen the
work of the river?
The pretty garden has been
carried away the other day.
The flood?
Already forgotten?
I opened the doors of the
Roy house that day.
One thousand people
took refuge there.
I have also many virtues.
I know. I am anxious.
A nightmare, last night...
Do you know my dream?
In a nymph music room,
there is a big party.
Rambha sings, Urbashi dances...
...and Menaka...
That's enough.
It's very late. Go to bed.
Will we go to Narayanpur?
We'll talk about it later.
Go to bed.
Where do you want to go?
Mother wrote.
Oh! Narayanpur...
Father is very sick.
Mother would like...
You can go.
I consider bringing Khoka.
Good.
And you?
Me? Why should I go?
I'm afraid to leave you alone.
With your crazy ideas...
Let's go there together.
There isn't much work now.
That's absurd.
Who will watch the land?
Who?
You! Watching the land?
Be serious...
Come with us.
Do you agree, if not...
Don't be insistent.
We'll talk about it.
You exaggerate.
Goodbye.
Say "see you soon"
rather than "goodbye".
Be good and behave.
Behave.
What do we hear?
A generator.
A generator?
Where?
At Ganguli's place. From the
terrace, we see the light.
At Mahim's?
He's been said to have bought
some English furniture.
Do you want me to play again?
Did you see the new house
of Ganguli?
What do you think of it?
Quite modern. Not as prestigious
as your palace.
No music room, no fountain.
No garden, no temple, nothing.
Next monday, Beggars' Day
at Ganguli's.
Mahim wishes to see you.
Tell him to come in.
Come in Mahim.
You must visit
my house, Master.
I repeat, would you honour
me with your visit?
On which occasion?
With your blessing, I have
built a house.
The inauguration is on Monday,
Bengali New Year's Day.
New Year's Day?
I already have a party at home.
On the first?
Yes, the lucky day.
The lucky day party?
I have never...
If you insist,
I can put it off.
Will that help?
No, no. It's not necessary.
You're the Master,
and we are...
Your plans first.
I can't do anything, you know.
Everything is already planned.
Please allow me to leave now.
Agreed. Good day.
Did you hear?
And the jewels?
It's the last box.
The last one?
How dare you say "last"
with this trivial tone...
Nothing is final.
Prepare everything.
Don't count money.
And this old musician?
What's his name?
The man from Murshidabad.
Ujir Khan, Master.
Go and fetch him.
He'll play a recital.
Send a messenger to Narayanpur.
Her Lordship and Khoka
must be back on the morning
of the first.
Everything's ready for lucky day.
The guests are arriving.
The boat is not back yet.
Must I send two others?
The storm looks threatening.
Go if you want.
I'll join you.
Is the boat back?
What's happened?
Drawn into a whirlpool.
What do you say?
Into a whirlpool?
Who told you that?
Kali is back.
Only Kali?
Who else? Nobody?
Speak! Nobody else?
The young Prince...
Khoka is back? Khoka!
You're still here?
Yes, Master.
Why?
What will happen
if we all leave?
Nothing.
It's all over.
It wouldn't have happened...
if you had paid more attention.
Because the land...
The land!
Where is it?
Everything is under water,
under deep water.
Devastated...
Everything has been devastated.
The Privy Council
has given its verdict,
everything is lost
except the sacred land.
Would Your Honour
please come downstairs?
Furniture must be sold.
Please...
I will never come
downstairs again.
Do whatever is best.
Listen.
Are Mati and Tufan still here?
Yes, Lord. They're here.
The Royal house of Sundarpur
has made an offer,
but we were waiting
for your order.
They will stay...
My Khoka's favorites.
The musician is downstairs,
should I call him?
Do you want to hear him?
Send him back.
No more music for me.
And your syrup?
Tomorrow I'll go downstairs.
You'll go downstairs?
I want to see Tufan and Mati.
You mean right now, Lord?
You go first and you warn them.
How are you doing?
The horse is sad because
you don't ride him anymore.
Does he eat his chickpeas?
Has the elephant still
his caparison?
I'm going to ask... Ahmad.
Tell him to embellish him.
To go... to Ganguli's house.
Send for the steward too.
I have asked them to adorn Mati.
Put this golden coin
on a silver plate
and bring it to Mahim's,
following the custom.
What are you waiting for?
There is no more
silver plate, Lord.
So take a copper one.
Yes, Lord.
That will do.
Close all the curtains.
Porter!
Servant!
You're here, steward!
Are you all dismissed?
Is there someone left
to announce me?
It's for a meeting.
A business one?
I'd rather talk to him directly.
Could you wait a moment?
This residence...
What a splendour!
Long ago, but now...
After all, even a dead elephant
is still worth 100.000 RS.
What do you say about it?
When you came this morning to
my house on this old elephant...
people greeted him
whereas they stoned and
scratched my new car.
I was driving myself!
The Master is calling you.
And you know why?
Because I have no pedigree,
I'm a self-made man.
Grandpa, you have turned
my invitation down!
Well... sit down.
I was wrong. I was so busy...
I wasrt able to come
in person to ask you...
No, no, it's nothing but...
I can't change my habits
...my age.
Come on Grandpa,
don't talk about your age...
I saw you riding a horse.
No Mahim, this time is gone!
I've grown so old since 4 years.
That explains that cane
in your hands.
Whatever, tonight
you must honour my house
with your noble presence.
Tonight?
Yes, tonight. My music room
is inaugurated.
Do you know Krishnabai?
From Lucknow.
No? Everybody's talking
about her.
It's said at her age...
that dance called...
Kathak...
No one is better than her.
Really?
Krishnabai's dancing,
and the best drum...
Who could appreciate
that as we do?
My car will wait for you
tonight around 8.
No, brother, thank you.
Why not?
I don't want to go out
at the moment.
Even for a concert?
So you won't come?
No thank you.
Allow me to leave then.
But your syrup?
My syrup! I forgot.
Goodbye.
I have to rush to town.
English officials will come...
The music room is closed?
Yes, since the other day.
Where is the key?
The steward got it.
Open it.
I bring a lamp.
What is Krishnabai's fee?
200, Lord!
How much money is left?
How much?
From the sacred land.
Tomorrow I give a concert.
I must get Krishnabai!
Impossible, Lord!
What did you say?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Everything's ready?
Except for some shopping.
Which ones?
Perfumes, candles...
Everything to honour my guests.
Any drinks?
Send Rahamat right away.
Let him ride Tufan.
Ganguli Babu has just
arrived, Lord.
Sit down, Mahim.
Tell me what will happen.
Why?
Well... the atmosphere
is strange.
I said: Is there someone...
to fan us?
Here you go, Grandpa.
How are you?
Are you satisfied?
Hoorah for the dancer!
The host reserves the right
of the first gift.
He failed.
He couldn't do it.
He couldn't do it.
He couldn't do it.
That usurer's son!
He wanted to break the top.
Such an arrogance!
He tries to reach the stars...
In vain, in vain.
Do you know why he fails?
Blood!
Blood in my veins.
Do you know which blood
flows in my veins?
Which one, Master?
You want to see?
You really want to?
Come here, come.
Look at my father.
Ramerswar.
My grandfather.
My great-grandfather.
Tarakesvar.
My great-great-grandfather.
Ravanesvar.
To you!
To you, noble ancestors!
To you!
And to you...
...my noble self.
All gone.
Gone?
Yes, all of them.
The lights too, Master.
Yes, the lights...
The candles are consumed,
Lord. It's dawn.
The sun is about to rise.
The sun is rising?
I'll open the curtains.
Tufan is calling me.
You can't, Lord, no.
My riding habit.
You can't.
My riding crop.
You let him go?
I begged him, but he refused.
God help us!
Blood!
The End
