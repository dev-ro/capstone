I've got this.
I've got this.
Yeah, I know.
Well, don't just stand there and watch,
go fucking do something.
Oh, please...
Oh.
Ah.
♪ Why do I keep wasting my time?
♪ Man, you make it easy for me
♪ So why can't I make you love me? ♪
It's the snapping. No...
You know you love it.
Are we too early?
- Michael...
- What?
We're not going to a party.
- Hey!
- Hi!
Hey.
- Are we too early?
- Oh, no.
Of course not, there's no such thing
as too early. You're perfect.
Michael!
Roads were wide open.
- Good to see you, Paul.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Jon.
- Hey, Grandpa.
Hello, how are you doing?
Good, you?
How are you doing?
- Good, fine.
- Okay, good.
- Michael... Um...
- No, I'll get it.
- I got you a little something.
- Oh, sweetie.
Really, it's nothing, it's just...
It's just a little something, you know.
We didn't really know...
I can't wait to see what the stores
recommend for an event like this.
All right, what is this?
Come on, let me help with...
Let me just...
- Jonathan, you wanna hand me the...
- I have it. I have it, it's fine.
I said I have it. It's fine, it's fine.
Fine, guys. There we go. Oh!
Salt and pepper shakers, look at that.
How sweet is this.
Look at you and me,
and we're dancing.
We had this whole back and forth.
Look at that. Now you can think of me
whenever you put salt
on your wounds, darling.
- Or pepper.
- Or pepper.
- Or both.
- Thank you, Jennifer.
- That was very thoughtful.
- Okay, yeah.
Someone's here.
Okay, yeah. That's... All right.
- So your beds are all made up and ready.
- Perfect.
- It's Liz.
- Oh, great.
Look what Jennifer made.
Jennifer, you made this cake?
Look at this!
- It's the size of a human...
- This could feed a village.
- Thanks, darling.
- Okay.
Okay.
Why is she here?
Oh, I know.
I told Dad it should just be family.
Salt and pepper shakers...
What was I thinking?
I think she liked them.
She pretended to.
She never pretends well enough.
What does that mean?
She lies just badly enough,
so you know she's lying.
Come on, I really think she liked them.
I do.
Besides, it's like she said,
it's not like
there's a perfect gift
for this kind of thing.
They're probably from Kenya or Peru
or somewhere.
I can only imagine the carbon footprint.
Carbon footprint and all, I thank you.
Hi. Hi, Liz.
- Hi.
- Hi, Jen.
You look great.
Wow, your hair looks great.
It does, it really does.
Hi, Liz.
Jonathan, look at you!
He's a great student.
Straight A's.
- One B.
- Mom.
Thanks for coming, Liz.
Sure.
I know it really means a lot
to Mom that we all do this.
Yeah, it does.
It's a privilege.
Anything we can do?
Here's an interesting article.
The local annual Thanksgiving
deep-fried turkey festival
apparently is going vegan.
Unbelievable.
- They're pretty.
- Hmm.
Your mother always had a thing
for white tulips.
Always the white ones.
Even in college.
What's she doing?
She'll be right down.
- Oh, what if she needs help.
- She's fine.
She's fine, Jennifer.
Whatever she's doing,
she'd rather do it herself.
Good.
Is everybody okay?
- Good.
- Everybody's fine.
- Doing great.
- Jonathan?
Uh-huh?
Jonathan has a hard time
talking about it.
No, I don't.
When's it happening?
Soon, kiddo.
Oh...
The flowers look beautiful.
So no one's drinking coffee?
Oh, let me... I can get that.
- I would love some.
- Yeah.
Please, here.
- Mom, you want some?
- No, I'm good.
Dad?
No, I'm fine.
- Liz?
- Mmm, please.
- Cream?
- Yeah.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
Your cup.
There you go.
Should someone call her?
I'm sure she's on her way.
She made that?
Wow.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
Hey!
- Oh, Chris...
- Hey.
Didn't know you were...
Good to see you.
I'm so happy that you came.
What, you kidding?
Of course I did.
Now I have someone
to get drunk with.
Jesus, look at you!
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Mom.
Hey, look at the teenager now.
Hey, I'm Chris.
- Oh, okay, I'll take that.
- Jonathan.
Good to meet you.
Yeah, you're hot.
Must be breaking some hearts, huh?
Hey, sweetie. How are you?
- Chris, good to see you too.
- No, no, come here.
Oh, you know what?
We only made up one single bed.
That's okay, Mom, I can help them.
I can make my own bed.
No, no, no, let me...
Let me help, yeah.
We can catch up at the same time.
Come on, let's get some coffee.
Great, okay.
- Elisabeth's here.
- Oh, fabulous.
It's been a while.
Yeah?
We thought you might come
to Jonathan's school play.
Sorry, I wanted to.
I really wanted to be there,
but there was...
I can't remember, something.
Mmm-hmm.
Here.
And Dad's birthday.
Ah, I wanted to be there for that, too.
Uh-huh.
Hey, thanks for all your texts.
What?
Reminding me.
Oh, yeah, sure.
I really thought you forgot.
Yeah, I realise that.
- Well, it's happened.
- It has.
- That wasn't intended as criticism.
- Mmm-hmm.
Towel's in here, I think.
So, how's the dance program going?
I dropped out.
Oh. Oh, I'm so...
I thought you made this big discovery
and finally found your thing.
I made a big discovery.
I found that it wasn't my thing.
Along with
the weird acupuncture thing,
and the quilting thing,
the yoga therapy thing...
Very informed. Very sympathetic.
All these things that they pay for.
Okay, here we go.
And while we're sharing...
What the hell is she doing here?
Uh, what's Mr Dull doing here?
Mr Dull happens
to be my husband.
Yeah, well, Chris happens
to be my husband.
You said you'd split up.
Well, we got back together.
Are you even sure you're gay?
We've been together
for nearly a year and a half.
God. A year and a half?
Oh, come on, what?
Disappointment, crisis, drama...
Because what was it? She was...
You said she was an immature,
irresponsible shit-for-brains.
Maybe I should wait downstairs.
Yeah, maybe you should. Thanks.
I'm sorry.
Shit.
Chris is helping me get through this.
Ever thought about that?
- You promised not to bring her.
- No.
You told me not to bring her.
There's a difference.
Okay.
Okay, please, just...
Give Mom this one weekend without having
the whole world
revolve around you, Anna?
Just one weekend?
Will you do that?
Hmm?
Can you do that?
- Can you quit being a fucking bitch?
- Okay.
Fuck.
- Last week, 35 pounds.
- Really?
- It was mostly cutting off sugar.
- Uh-huh.
And then cheese,
which was the hard part.
How do you think she's doing?
Dodging every emotional bullet.
Ah.
And how are you?
I'm a little tired of people saying,
"And how are you?"
Yeah, sorry.
How's work?
Work is a...
An undergrad, last week,
refused to read the Odyssey,
because it was "literally everything
that was wrong with the world."
- The Odyssey?
- Mm-hmm, the Odyssey.
Okay, three down,
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O.
Five letters.
What?
- That's it?
- That's it.
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O.
Huh.
Yes, I'm surrendering to Chablis.
- Shall I get a funnel?
- Thanks.
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O, five letters,
that is...
- That's the whole clue?
- What are they doing?
Playing soccer?
It's hard to tell.
So, are you and Chris
living together now, or...
No, it's...
We've been a little on and off.
When I was your age,
I had someone
I moved in with four times.
And out, four times.
With all my belongings, all my books.
And my cat.
- That crazy cat.
- That crazy cat.
That's a lot of moving...
- for a cat.
- Right.
Well, I was confused.
I was out there fighting for free love.
How could I tie myself
down like that?
It gets easier, I guess.
Oh, yes.
The old woman lied.
Water.
- What?
- Water?
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O, H to O, five letters.
Water is the answer.
- H2O... Oh.
- That is brilliant.
He's good, your dad.
- He is good.
- The best.
Did you know that next to Q, X and Z,
"J" is the least used letter
in the English language?
- Hi.
- Honey, have some cake.
Your mom's cake is over there,
it's so delicious.
- It's so good, you have to try it.
- I want some of that.
What?
Jonathan, your shoes are wet.
You should've left them by the door.
Well, you know it's time
when you have to
start drinking your Chablis
from a paper cup.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- I'll get it. I'll get it.
- Good.
- It's fine.
- It's fine.
I'm not.
Glass everywhere.
It's okay. Be careful, Jennifer.
Never liked those glasses.
Those glasses...
Okay, so, 11 across...
E.T.
- A fish.
- Finding Nemo?
Oh, okay. Um...
It's a hat.
- Harry Potter!
- She got it.
Now you go!
Black Panther.
King. A king!
Oh, Lion King!
I wanna see what you got!
You're a...
King Kong!
Yeah!
I'm okay now.
Blow out the candles.
Hi.
Do you remember that night,
that pizza party on the farm,
when we tried acid?
I think you persuaded me.
We needed to listen to the fireflies,
because they were trying
to tell us something.
Probably not to do any more acid
and to stick to mushrooms.
Would you look after my girls?
You don't need to ask, Lily.
They're okay, aren't they?
They're okay.
Hey.
Thank you, Lily.
Thank you, Liz.
You're up early.
Couldn't sleep.
Oh.
How are you gonna do it?
You want me to tell you?
They told me not to worry about it
and make sure
Grandma has a nice weekend.
Well, they were just
trying to protect you.
But I want to know.
You sure?
Tomorrow, after you've all gone,
I'll put her to bed.
I'll give her some medicine in a glass,
and then,
she'll go to sleep,
while I sit beside her.
And then...
That's it.
Yeah.
It's illegal, right?
Yeah, it's...
It's illegal here, but it's legal
in some states, in Washington, Oregon...
We could've gone to Europe,
but this is...
This is our home, this is the house
that she built.
This is where Lil wants it to happen.
She seems okay to me.
She doesn't seem that bad.
Do you know how ill she is?
You've seen how she walks,
how she can only use
her right arm, right?
In a few weeks it's possible
she won't be able to move at all.
To talk, or even to swallow.
Try to imagine the horror
of not being able to swallow.
She'll be surrounded by machines,
to help her breathe,
to remove the saliva and so on.
And we'd have to feed her
through a tube...
in the side, there.
She doesn't want that.
And she's decided that now's the...
Now's the time to do it while she's
still in charge of what happens to her.
Will you go to jail?
After she's gone,
I go out for a walk,
I get back and I call 911.
I tell them what's happened,
that she must've taken the medicine
while I was out, and, um...
And something like,
"Yes, I'm sure she's dead.
I'm a doctor and everything."
Yeah, I tell them...
I tell them I went out for a walk.
And that's why we have to do it now,
while she still has the use of her arm.
Waking up.
- Morning!
- Morning.
- Mmm, cholesterol.
- Morning. Sleep all right?
- Ah, good morning everybody!
- Good morning.
Smells amazing.
Wow. Whoa, Jonathan!
Haven't seen you up
this early in forever.
It's really not that early, Dad.
- Are Anna and Chris up?
- It's 8:30.
No, Jonathan, why don't you run up
and wake them?
I can do it. I can do it.
Anna, Chris!
You up yet? I'm dead soon,
you coming down?
That should do it.
Pancakes.
Yep, that should do it.
Did you know this is one of
the oldest foods in history?
Yes, I did know that, Michael.
I'm gonna get tea.
Anybody want tea?
- Liz, tea?
- Yeah, tea. Great.
Jonno, will you pass the salt
and pepper, please?
Jonno, salt and pepper, please?
Thank you.
You know, the Indian
independence movement started
when Gandhi asked the Indians
to make their own salt,
in an act of defiance
against the British Empire.
Oh.
Just think about it, how
something so insignificant
could lead to something so powerful.
You were always such a rebel.
Did you hear that? I'm a rebel.
You hear that, Jon?
I think she was kidding.
Dad, she's choking.
- No, I'm fine.
- Dad, she's choking.
I'm fine. Fine.
Wow, we really lucked out
with the weather today.
- Will you pass the...
- Yeah, we did, didn't we?
Maybe we should go for a walk later.
- A walk?
- Oh, yeah, that's really nice.
What do you wanna do, Mom?
I really don't know.
Mom, what do you wanna do?
I think a walk sounds like a nice idea.
Then tonight, just to keep you
on your toes,
if it's all right with everyone,
I'd like to celebrate Christmas.
I mean, it's so much better
than boring old Thanksgiving, right?
I think, darling, maybe you could
make us a big Christmas dinner.
- The whole shebang?
- The whole shebang.
And, uh, Jonno, maybe you could
go with your dad and find us a tree.
- Great.
- Okay.
The axe is in the barn.
- The axe?
- Mmm-hmm.
Don't get arrested.
And then afterwards, Jonno,
why don't you help me
decorate the tree?
Sure.
Wait, are we going to get presents?
Oh, I like that line of thinking.
If you are very nice, Santa will bring
you an inheritance, yes.
Cool. Are you rich?
Jonathan, come on.
- I'm fine.
- Why not?
The only stipulation being it has to
all be spent on hookers and blow.
Sounds good.
She means it.
Is this really what you want? I mean...
You could wait
for an actual Christmas...
Jennifer, don't fucking ruin this.
Okay.
Well, I could, um... I could be Santa,
if you want.
- That's a great idea.
- With enough food I can get that belly.
- Dude, that will be so sick.
- Okay.
And now, pass the bacon.
No more green shit for me,
I'm gonna have this bacon.
...place for surgery
used to ask for the hitch back
upon the patient's death.
They would have to sign a release.
And we had to go back to the morgue...
- Listen.
- Yeah?
Is it your idea
that if you wanna have the...
- I like her.
- So do I.
Plus, it's so, so chic to have a lesbian
in the family, did you know that?
We tried it once, remember?
What was it... '73 or '74?
Yeah, it was definitely
a drunken attempt.
Maybe a lack of technique?
Oh, I thought your technique was fine.
She's...
She's fragile, isn't she?
- Anna?
- Anna.
No. She's fine. She's absolutely fine.
She's just a little flighty.
All this back and forth, is that a sign
the relationship is right,
or that it's broken?
Maybe they don't really love each other
or maybe they really love each other.
Yeah, useful analysis, thanks.
I'm out of gas.
- What?
- I'm out of gas.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just need to...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- ...sit down.
- Hey, hey, Paul!
Jen, can you come?
Ah!
Beautiful!
Invigorating, isn't it?
Yes, it is. It is invigorating!
What?
Jonathan, cover your ears.
Why?
- Just...
- This is...
This is where you were conceived.
Oh, my God, that is gross.
Here?
- Right here?
- Yeah.
We were visiting a colleague of Paul's,
who lived right near here and well,
the wife was just fucking annoying.
- Oh, God, she would never stop talking.
- Never stop.
Yack, yack, yack. Never stopped.
Even when she was eating
or something else, she never stopped,
and all that came out of her mouth...
Was shit.
It was the worst.
So I pretended to be sick,
and we ran outside,
and we came here, and then...
- He cured me.
- I cured you!
Okay, TMI. TMI.
And then we just got
so fond of this area
that we bought some land
when it became available,
and then, well, we couldn't
even afford it at that time.
- Couldn't afford you then.
- No.
Well, I'm not surprised that you come
from some place so beautiful.
Aw!
- Sweet.
- That's deep.
That is... that is deep!
What about me?
- What about you, sweetie?
- Where was I conceived?
Oh.
You know what,
I don't really know.
I know, I know, it was when I went
with you to that convention in...
- Buffalo?
- Buffalo.
We stayed at that horrible motel
near the airport
and I got bedbugs, I remember that.
- Oh, no!
- But it was totally worth it!
It was totally worth it. Completely.
- All right, shall we move on?
- Oh, God.
- Shall we?
- Yeah.
Oh, right there.
Let's go.
Oh!
Left-handed.
Anna?
Anna?
Anna.
Come on.
I know.
What did you think I was doing?
Playing Candy Crush,
taking a nap,
getting high?
Anna...
Okay. Okay, yeah.
Yes, I did.
I did and I'm sorry.
- Can you blame me?
- Yes, I fucking can blame you.
You never give me a fucking break.
Look, you arrived late as always,
looking like shit.
God, no one even knows
where you are half the time.
You disappear for a month
eating mushrooms in the desert
or whatever the hell
"off the grid" means,
just as Mom gets sick
and you expect me not to be judgmental.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I just wish...
that with so little time left,
you made more of an effort
for the family.
That's all.
I am going to do that.
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
I made up my mind.
Tomorrow, when they're about to do it,
I'm gonna call 911
and report a suicide attempt.
Okay.
Um...
Shit.
Okay, that's...
Are you sure?
Because she says she's ready.
I'm not ready.
She's ready, but I'm not.
I don't know. It's too fucked-up.
I thought you were against this, too.
What about the effing vegans?
You want me to take care of that?
Yeah, well, maybe some sweet potatoes.
I don't know.
Okay, well...
That it?
- Yeah, that's it.
- What?
Magic potion?
I mean, where is it from?
Google.
How do you know
it's gonna work?
Trust me, darlings.
Enough pentobarbital
in that little package
to kill off half of Manhattan.
As you can imagine,
everything's being organised
within an inch of its life.
Yep, I can imagine.
It is a little insane.
No, no, no, it's not. It's...
The people in this situation, those who
choose to end their lives prematurely,
are characteristically not insane,
not even...
not even depressed.
They're usually
intelligent, articulate,
analytical,
and deeply, deeply controlling.
Thanks.
- Sweet potatoes.
- On it.
I'll get it.
Okay.
This is nice.
Huh? Doing Christmas?
Yeah, I guess.
I like this
spending time together,
man and boy in the wild.
- We should do more of this.
- Sure.
Hey, here's your fun fact about trees.
Do you know there's more
non-deciduous trees in Norway
than the entire continent of Africa?
- It's fascinating, Dad.
- Isn't it? It's...
Here we go,
a lot of good choices over here.
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Huh. How about this one?
- That one?
- Yeah.
It's kind of small.
How about this one?
Okay. Good.
Good option.
Here we go.
- Whoa.
- Fuck.
You okay?
- Yeah, I'm...
- You sure?
No, I'm good. I'm good.
Yeah.
I'm just, uh,
used to a different kind of axe.
- That's enough.
- We need something else.
- What about rosemary for these?
- Rosemary's great.
- Does that really go with beef?
- Oh, definitely.
Honey, what can I do for you?
I'm really... I'm fine.
I'm fine, it'll wear off.
- This has happened before.
- You should sit down.
- Maybe some ice?
- Maybe some frozen peas?
- Oh, yeah, okay. That's...
- Thanks for being so helpful.
- It's okay.
- Okay.
- You're really suffering?
- Oh, no. I'm really... It's fine.
I mean, it's not funny,
but it's pretty funny.
It is kinda funny.
I don't even really need these.
- Jonathan?
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna help?
- Sure.
How about a glass of wine?
So why don't you start hanging
and if you put anything where
I don't like it, I will yell at you.
Okay.
So are you gonna give me
some super important life advice now?
Nah.
Old people are supposed
to be insightful,
and, you know, pass on your experiences.
So I remember them at crucial moments
in my life.
We old people are just pretending
to be insightful,
to give you the impression
that life adds up
to something meaningful
and comprehensible.
It works.
Actually, I think that
the trick is you just show up
and you give life your best shot.
Although handwritten thank-you notes
- and being on time don't hurt.
- Got it.
Your mom made this one.
Cool.
So is there anything
that I should know about you
that the rest of the family is gonna
find out in the future?
I don't know.
Do you want to have kids?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Are you gay?
- No.
- Trans?
- No.
- Anything else I don't know about yet?
No. Sorry.
What do you think you want to be?
I want to be an actor.
Wow. Wow.
Do they know about that?
Um, nobody knows about that.
Except now you do.
Well, I will take your secret
to my grave.
You're doing great.
Wow, smells amazing.
- That is a tremendous tie, Michael.
- Thank you.
It is a tremendous tie.
Where is she?
Oh, she'll be here.
- Jen?
- Thank you.
Short measures.
- Michael?
- Thank you.
I think I might go check.
Hi.
So when do we eat?
- Fantastic.
- You look amazing.
Wow.
- Mom, you look...
- Thank you.
- So beautiful.
- Thanks very much.
- Everybody, ready?
- Emmental.
It's on the front, yeah.
Okay, ready, everyone?
Say cheese.
Emmenthaler.
- Emmenthaler.
- Good, good.
Paul, did you get the tie?
Oh, Dad, could get one with
you in it maybe? Liz, would you mind?
- Good idea, Jennifer.
- Yeah.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
All right, sit. Let's...
I'm going to make a toast.
That's a surprise.
To...
wonderful life.
To wonderful life.
Mmm, mmm.
- Wow.
- So this is, uh,
Gevrey-Chambertin. It's a
Red Burgundy, it's a French Pinot noir.
- I taste sunshine?
- Good sunshine.
- Oh, here's... Jonathan. Wanna try?
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.
- No. No.
He won't, no.
I've had wine before.
- When?
- Hmm.
- Well, it's illegal, so...
- Yeah.
- ...you're not getting any.
- So is killing Grandma.
Ooh, nice comeback, kiddo.
- Whoa.
- Very smart.
You're gonna make an excellent lawyer
someday.
Actually, I'm gonna be an actor.
- An actor?
- Yeah.
- And isn't that a damn fine thing?
- It is.
Well, there's plenty of time
to think about it, so.
I don't need to think about it.
I know it.
Actually, yeah, I think...
I think Jonathan may have written
a little something for his grandma.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Oh, Jonathan, I'm honoured.
- No, please.
- Come on.
Yeah.
It's like a rap.
It's kinda rough,
I don't want to do it right now.
- I've only just written it.
- Well, come on.
Go for it, dude.
- Okay, whatever. Yeah. Okay.
- Yes.
Here goes nothing. Hit me.

- Go, Jonno.
- Jonno!
Really wonderful.
Watch me,
I'm the meat guy.
- No one wants to eat?
- Please.
Oh, my God.
Whoa!
Please don't laugh,
please do not encourage him.
- That's really great.
- How does he...
No one's watching the spoon.
- Thank you.
- Very good.
- Jonathan, this one's for you.
- Cool.
Thanks.
- Hmm.
- What is it?
- A book.
- Yeah?
Thanks.
Um...
- What's...
- It's Rookie. Roukah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- What?
- Whoa. Hundred-dollar bill.
- Now...
- I never had one of these.
How are you supposed to spend it?
- Hookers and blow.
- Yes!
- Do you remember these? Yeah.
- Of course I do.
Thank you.
Well, tell them.
It's so beautiful.
She bought this when we were...
Where were we?
- When we went to that antique shop.
- Yeah, in...
In, uh, Venice.
- That was a great trip.
- The best trips ever.
We saw this in some little
antique jeweler's.
We were imagining what it is and you
thought you were gonna be a contessa.
Love you, Liz.
Oh, wow.
Oh.
- Do you remember?
- Yeah, I remember this.
It's Grandma's ring.
It's the only thing I liked about her.
That is actually true.
I don't blame you, sweetheart.
She's a nightmare.
Mmm.
- Michael?
- I get a present? This is...
I had to look all over for this.
Oh, my God!
That is so great.
He's never gonna
take that off.
Put it on.
- Oh.
- Yes.
He's never gonna
take that off.
- Nor should he.
- What do you think?
What do you think?
Jonathan, I'm going to your
parent-teacher conference wearing this.
This was the first kind of
serious piece of jewellery
that I bought for myself at your age.
This is... this is beautiful.
Oh, look at that.
That really suits you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sweetheart.
I love it.
I don't know if you already have
one of these, but...
you can always use another one.
Oh!
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?
You needs one.
Oh, it's your favourite colour.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my.
- It matches. Oh, my God.
I'm afraid she already has one.
That's not your only present,
I want you to have this.
I've never taken it off
since your dad gave it to me...
- 22 years ago.
- Oh.
Oh, God. Thank you.
Okay.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I think maybe I haven't taken this off
for even longer.
But maybe now it's time
to give it to you.

Thank you, husband.
- Thanks, Grandpa.
- Thanks.
I could die happy right now.
So could I.
Mmm.
- I love these plates.
- Well, you can have them. They're yours.
I'll just eat out of the pot, then.
Yeah, with your salt and pepper shaker
by your side.
Yeah, I'd like that.
I mean, if that's okay with...
Hey, maybe
you could pick something, too.
How about my vinyl? You used to love
all those R&B records...
- Yeah.
- ...and Nina Simone, and...
Yeah, maybe it could wait
until you're actually dead.
I think it's time for a joint.
- What, really?
- Oh, what are you looking at?
Come on, I was at Woodstock.
What's the big deal?
- You weren't.
- All right, well, I was nearby.
- I was there in my mind.
- Bullshit.
Nowadays you never meet anyone our age
- who wasn't at Woodstock, allegedly.
- True.
- Allegedly, I have some.
- Oh, what kind?
- Just Napa Valley grass.
- Not strong enough.
Sweetheart, will you get mine?
- What?
- Wait, uh...
Uh, Mom.
Oh.
Jonathan, uh...
you should never smoke weed
unless you're dying.
- Okay.
- Or having sex.
I already tried it.
- What?
- Excuse me?
- What?
- I don't want you to end up
like some unfocused pothead
who just drifts through life
staring at the clouds.
Hey, I'm right here.
Yeah, well.
You're not exactly
the perfect role model.
And you are?
Just in time.
- Oh, come on, Dad.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
- Thank you.
Great. Great.
Let's all get stoned.
Jesus.
What is this stuff?
- You like?
- Are you kidding me? Yes.
That is some next-level shit.
Oh.
- No.
- Are you sure?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.
It's been a long time.
Hold the smoke,
count to 10.
Hey, I too was at Woodstock.
Metaphorically.
Okay.
Maybe I wasn't.
Okay.
- Come on.
- Oh.
No way.
We're here to do
something together, right?
Yes.
Wow.
Hold it.
- Oh, my God.
- Hold it.
When will I feel it?
In a little, just a little bit.
- Whoa!
- Yeah.
Just... Just chill.
- You okay, Mom?
- Just chill.
Good?
I don't know, I'm...
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
We are terrible parents.
Wait, stop.
Does it have tobacco in it?
It's just... Michael quit smoking.
I'm sure it's fine.
Okay, you know,
I'm really not that bossy.
I'm... I'm actually very sweet.
Yes, you are.
Come on, pass it on, Dad.
The other way.
You know, I know...
I know you guys already talked about it,
but I wasn't there. And, uh...
Anyway, I just wanted to say
that I understand.
Thank you, Chris.
It's just weird.
You're here now...
but tomorrow you'll be dead,
and we know.
But I'm here now.
I'm really here now.
And, you know, once we set a date,
actually, it's funny, but it...
I stopped worrying about dying
and I could focus more on living.
Aren't you afraid?
Are you?
Well, I'm not dying tomorrow.
Well, at some point.
Yes.
And we all know
that it's... it's gonna happen.
I just didn't know that I would know
that I would know
when it was actually happening.
No, but isn't that the point?
I mean,
we sort of, we forget, in order
to just get on with living.
Everything is so much better
if you don't forget,
because then you don't get caught up
in the bullshit
and you can take a risk
and you can bend some rules.
You know?
The days go by too slowly
and the years go by too fast.
- Bingo.
- That's so cool.
It's Magnetic Fields.
What's that?
- It's music, Dad.
- Oh.
Look, I am... I am here now...
- Yeah.
- ...and I am full of good food
and incredible wine. And...
I'm satisfied and...
happy.
I have my... my guy,
my grandson,
the actor slash rapper,
my oldest friend
and the two kids that I am so proud of
and the ones that they love.
"The two kids I'm so proud of"?
Yes.
Why would you be proud of us?
Why wouldn't I be proud of you?
I mean, you barely know us.
What?
What's that supposed to mean?
Sweetie, I raised you to be
strong and independent, and you are.
- Really?
- Really.
- No, we're not.
- Anna.
Look, I'm sorry to break it to you,
but you have two daughters
who are, in their own way,
seriously fucked-up.
I don't think that
that is necessarily...
Look, I might be crazy
but I'm not stupid.
- What are you talking about?
- Okay.
Remember when Chris and I went away
for a month?
- Yeah.
- Well, I wasn't living in the desert.
Where were you?
I was in a psychiatric hospital
because I tried to kill myself.
Jesus Christ.
I can't fucking believe you.
Oh, my God.
Oh, please. Did she threaten
to cut her wrist with a plastic knife
- so she could get some attention?
- Shut the fuck up, Jennifer.
That's what she does every time
- and everybody gets sucked in.
- You didn't raise us to be strong.
You just raised us
not to bother you with weakness.
Oh, my God. Stop.
You're like Martha-fucking-Stewart, Mom.
- Anna.
- What a great mom
you wanted everybody to think you were.
- Anna.
- Be creative with your mantra,
be whatever you want to be.
Just don't disturb the grown-ups
while you're doing it
and be sure to clean up afterwards.
Stop. Dad, come on.
- Stupid little fuck.
- Jennifer.
- Dad, Dad.
- Stop, stop.
- Stop!
- Dad.
I want to go to bed,
I think I have to go to bed now.
Sweetie.
I didn't...
It's all right.
Let's clear the table.
She wants to be alone for a little bit.
What?
She didn't overstate it.
She's lucky that she survived.
Of course,
that's how she describes it,
'cause she wants maximum sympathy.
All right, what do you say
you and I go have a talk?
Come on.
Why wouldn't she tell us?
Well, she said you'd say
it was about attention-getting.
That you'd say
it was about maximum sympathy.
I don't know, maybe you're right.
But then I gotta ask what made her need
that kind of attention?
We'd been on and off for a while.
I wasn't sure,
she wasn't sure, the usual shit. But...
when the ambulance came,
I couldn't even bring myself
to get in with her,
hold her hand, whatever,
just be with her.
All I wanted to do was run
and so that's what I did.
- Is she okay now?
- Is she okay? No.
Well, she's bipolar.
What does that even mean?
Means a shitload of meds forever.
So why aren't you running now?
I don't know.
I like her.
I like her family.
Look, I...
- What?
- Your mom seems so sure
and I really... I really do believe
that it's her decision.
What are you trying to say?
Anna's not exactly well,
and so I don't want Anna's perspective
- to ruin...
- Say it.
Anna's gonna call 911
when your mom is taking the pills.
Wait, wait!
What the hell are you thinking?
- What?
- You let her do what she wants to do.
You got that?
You let her do what she wants.
You can't make that call.
- I'm not!
- Do you understand me?
Tell me you understand.
- I'm not ready.
- I don't care.
What if... What if Dad is wrong?
Maybe it'll be another six months
before it gets real bad.
- Maybe a year?
- He's a fucking doctor.
- He knows what he's doing.
- Doesn't matter.
Doctors are wrong all the time.
Mom knows what she wants
and he knows how to do it.
- That's enough.
- I want to know her.
I want her to know me.
Don't you get that? I need more time.
So do I.
But this is Mom's decision.
It's her life, it's her death.
- I'm sorry you're sick.
- I'm not sick.
- Yes, you are.
- Okay.
What are you doing?
Don't go through my shit.
- Xanax. Serax. Lithium!
- Don't touch my shit.
You know who they give this stuff to?
They give it to sick people.
I'm not sick.
They just keep things in check.
I'm okay when I take them.
But your brain chemistry is fucked
and you can't trust your emotions.
So shut the fuck up from now on
and let her do what she wants to do.
Look at me.
Look at me.
I am sorry
that I've not been there for you.
I will be better. I... I pro...
I promise
I will be better.
But this is Mom's decision,
and that is how it's gonna be.
Okay?
She understands.
Chris...
Thanks.
Yeah.
Hey!
Uh...
What are you doing?
Looking at photos.
Uh-huh.
Uh...
Here we are.
Mexico.
Me, Dad, Mom, Liz.
San Francisco.
Anna, me, Dad, Mom...
Liz.
Hiking in Banff.
And, um...
London.
Me, Anna, Dad, Mom...
and Liz.
Her best friend?
- Yeah.
- Right.
And...
his lover.
- No. No.
- Or something...
No, I mean...
Mom told me years ago
that Dad and Liz had dated,
you know, in college,
before Mom even knew him.
I never thought...
just never,
put two and two together.
And then, last night.
Yeah, what?
I saw them...
kissing!
But like...
for real.
They were probably just...
What?
Just... They were probably just...
comforting each other.
No, no. No.
What if he's in love with her?
What if he always was?
I don't think that
that's something that...
I mean,
wouldn't that cloud his judgement?
Okay, you're really tired.
- Honey.
- I'm not fucking tired, Michael.
- What do you think I should do?
- I think you should sleep!
But should I tell Mom? Should I...
Should I tell...
Should I tell them both
- that I will not support this after all?
- No, your mom has made her decision!
- Okay?
- What do you think?
Lily's been very clear
from the very beginning.
What do you think?
What do you think about all of it?
You? Right here, right now.
What do you think?
I think this is a really
difficult decision,
- and that the family...
- Do you think anything? Do you...
- Do you feel...
- Yeah, I feel things, of course I do!
What?
It's impossible to get
any kind of reaction from you!
If I threw this wine in your face,
you just tell me what district
the grapes were from.
That is not true! I think I'm...
God!
I'm so sorry... Oh, my God!
Honey, here...
Will you close the blinds?
You want to sleep some more?
I want to wake up again.
One more time.
I just woke up one morning
and I couldn't remember
what healthy felt like.
It didn't scare me.
It was a relief.
So I cancelled my plans
with Chris that night.
I took a shower.
Isn't that weird?
I watched the happy people on TV
and I ate a handful of pills
and drank a mug of vodka.
Passed out.
Then Chris came over anyway,
she wanted to surprise me.
She called 911,
the ambulance took me to the hospital
and pumped me out.
I stayed three weeks.
They gave me medicine and...
I still take it and I'll keep taking it.
That's okay.
Why didn't you tell me?
- You always told us to be strong.
- Oh, Jesus.
Be free.
I didn't want to be free,
I just wanted to feel like me.
I am so sorry. I am so, so sorry.
So sorry, baby.
And you had just found out
you were sick.
- I didn't want you to worry about it.
- Oh, my God.
You have no idea how happy it would
have made me to worry about it.
Let me worry about you. Oh.
I'm so sorry.
I love you. I love you, sweet girl.
I'm sorry.
Ha-ha!
- Can I help?
- I got it.
Do you want me...
No sweetie, I got it.
I got it.
Mom?
Okay?
Good morning.
Hey!
- Hi!
- Good morning!
Okay.
Ah...
Okay, so...
Today...
Today, um...
Can we all try to just
behave as normally
as possible?
Just read the Sunday paper and...
nap, uh,
play the stock market, write a play.
Make a...
matchstick model of...
of the Empire State Building.
Just a normal Sunday.
I need...
to have a normal...
lazy Sunday.
I need that from you.
Okay?
- Okay!
- Got it!
- Okay.
- You got it. All right.
Okay, good.
Um...
Juice?
Jennifer?
No, I'm not thirsty.
Should I make some coffee?
No.
Jonathan, why don't you
pass the juice?
Sure.
- Anna?
- Thank you.
Hmm, what?
Come with me for a minute.
Okay.
Remember when you were
about eight years old,
it was summer,
and you came rushing into the house
and you said that you had seen
Dad and Elisabeth kissing in the woods?
And everybody just laughed at you.
Do you remember?
Yeah, I remember.
And people said you were crazy
and people said you were bad.
Yes, you said I was bad.
Well, I think you were...
I think Dad and Liz, are...
lovers.
What?
Last night I saw them together.
Think about it. Every family vacation,
she's been there.
Every important occasions,
it's always been Mom, Dad and Liz.
Why? I mean, that's not normal.
We've grown up thinking that's normal.
That is not normal.
Do we tell Mom?
No! No, we can't, we can't.
Can we?
Well, fuck, I don't know
anything any more.
Look, if he's with Liz,
he can't make a rational decision.
What if she's manipulating him?
We've known Liz all our lives,
I don't believe that's her.
I'm not saying
she's doing it deliberately, but...
But... Okay,
we tell Mom
we've changed our minds and we're
not going along with this any more.
Yes?
Jonathan, go upstairs, please.
- Why?
- Jennifer?
Don't ask questions, just go upstairs.
Jonathan?
- I want you to go upstairs now.
- Too bad.
- I don't want you to hear this.
- Hear what?
I'm part of this, Mom.
- He's right, he should be here.
- What's going on?
Can we just see...
See this through
with a bit of ordinary grace?
Ordinary grace, you fucking hypocrite?
All right, sit down, Jen.
Please don't tell me to sit down, okay?
I won't, I won't sit down, I won't.
This...
This is sick.
Jennifer, whatever it is
you want to say,
do us all a favour and don't say it.
- Everything's been said.
- Well, not quite everything.
Don't do this, Jennifer.
What the hell is
going on here?
Maybe you shouldn't go through with it,
maybe you don't have
all the information you need
to make an informed decision.
What are you talking about?
Dad?
- What?
- Dad.
- What?
- Tell her!
Okay. Okay.
We're not gonna let this happen.
It's not right.
Jennifer, we have gone
over and over this for months,
and we came to the conclu...
As a family, we agreed that
if this is what I want...
But I don't think
you know what you want.
How dare you?
We got behind this
on the basis of a lot of assumptions.
- What assumptions?
- Okay.
Hey, hey, let her talk, Paul, please.
Please,
we're talking with Mom
- right now, okay? Dad, not you.
- Well, who's "we"?
Anna and I agree.
- Anna?
- Anna.
Yeah, Jennifer and I agree.
I cannot...
No, I cannot back down from this. No.
Well, we can.
Jennifer, this is not
what she needs right now.
You can shut up.
This is not your decision.
It's not yours either.
This is your mother's choice.
Is it really?
Or has she been helped along, huh?
What are you saying?
Look, I choose. I choose. Look at me.
I choose not to be locked in a body
that cannot
walk or talk, or eat or drink,
or even breathe on its own.
I am choosing not to be fed
vanilla-fucking-flavoured protein drinks
through a tube in my side.
I choose! I choose.
I am choosing!
There are moral issues, okay?
- Ethical issues.
- Do not make my last
act on this Earth
in defiance of you.
Please, don't do that to us.
Jennifer,
what's going on here?
I saw you last night.
- Saw what?
- What did you see?
What did she see?
You two.
- So what? What are you talking about?
- Jennifer?
No, no!
You don't get to speak.
No, no, no.
I really think it's my turn to speak.
You say I'm having some
love affair with your father, right?
Well, you are, aren't you?
- Aren't you?
- Christ!
Jennifer, you know what?
You were always such a fucking prig.
Look how lucky you are!
A husband who adores you,
an amazing kid
and still, you're always straightening
every picture in the room.
I never managed this family.
Here's my family.
The people I grew up with,
the people I loved and love.
Don't take that away.
Please, don't take that away.
You didn't answer the question.
You didn't answer the question, Liz.
Answer, somebody!
Answer!
Or I'm gonna call 911.
What?
I'm not kidding,
I'll make the call.
Oh, good. What will you say?
I'm gonna say
there has been a suicide attempt
and that they need to come right away.
Answer me. Somebody!
Do it.
Anna!
Wait, wait, wait!
Of course they're having an affair.
Of course they're having an affair.
I begged them to have an affair.
I implored them to have an affair.
What?
All our lives?
Oh, no, no, no...
Since I've been sick.
How can that be okay?
How can it be okay for my best friend
and my husband to love each other?
Don't you see that...
that that makes a space
so that I can do this?
Don't you see?
Love...
is everything.
Love is all there is.
Why didn't you tell us?
Would you have...
approved?
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Okay, now I'm scared.
Of course you are.
Me too.
Look, maybe you all should...
It's time.
- Now?
- Now.
Yeah, I'm...
I'm done, I can feel it.
I know it's coming towards me,
and I do not want it.
So if it's...
okay with you guys?
Jen?
Yeah.
Anna?
Okay.
But I want to be with you
when you die.
- Anna, I don't think...
- Are you strong enough?
Yeah.
Yeah, she is.
I'm with Anna.
Just don't let me die
with my mouth open.
Now I'm frightened.
Don't be frightened.
Where am I going?
You tell me, kiddo.
Hmm.
