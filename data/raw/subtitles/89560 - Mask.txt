How about a kiss in the sun?
How about not a kiss
in the sun?
Why not?
It's very romantic.
Oh, Mr. Romance. Great.
Hey, Mom!
- What?
- You forgot what we
gotta do this morning.
Jesus, who's that?
My son. Did I?
The school, the clinic,
the blood run.
It's today, Mom.
Oh, shit.
Wait a second.
What's going on?
I gotta do a million things
with my kid.
You got things to do?
What about us?
 We can get together
some other time.
What the hell have I
been doing for five hours?
I don't know.
 I don't think so.
I just gave her
a ride home.
Wait a minute.
Mom.
I'm sorry.
Hey, look.
I just gave her
a ride home.
Okay, okay. All right.
Hey, Rock.
Yo, Red.
This the one you
been looking for?
No, I already got
two Steve Garveys.
I told you that
wasn't the right one.
Thanks anyway, Red.
He's trying to find, uh,
Ruby Walters.
Rube Walker,
card number 108.
108. Brooklyn Dodgers.
1955.
Good year.
Seems like yesterday.
You say that
about everything, Red.
Everything does.
I seen you
grandstanding for her.
I was protecting her.
Where the hell were you?
Here comes Mom.
You got the lease?
I got everything else.
Ah, shit.
I told you it
was Rube Walker.
You said...
Shut up. Let's get goin'.
We're late.
What's the matter?
You never saw anybody from
the planet Vultern before?
Mom.
Beep, beep-beep-beep.
Yes, uh, may...
Never mind.
Uh, wait a minute!
Ma'am!
Hi. I'm here to register
my son for the ninth grade.
Well, uh, Mrs...
No "Mrs."
I'm Rusty Dennis.
This is my son Rocky.
Please, sit down.
We're running a little bit late.
So could you move it along?
This is a public junior
high school, Miss Dennis.
There are
special schools...
with wonderful facilities
that might be more appropriate
for his needs.
Do you teach algebra
and biology and English here?
- Of course.
- Those are his needs.
Perhaps I should speak
to the boy's father.
Perhaps you should
speak to the pope too.
He'd be a lot easier to find.
Under the circumstances,
I do feel that for the good of
my students as well as your son,
I'm going to need
some additional information...
Mr. Simms, you know what?
Don't jerk me around.
I'm not in the mood.
I've had a real
crappy day so far.
First I find out we're in the
wrong school district. I gotta
come play pussyfoot with you.
This is a copy of our lease,
this is a copy of
Rocky's birth certificate,
and this is his last
report card from
Stevens Junior High School...
where he was in the top
five percent of his class.
And I got some additional
information for you. My lawyer's
name is B.D. Higgins.
He's told me of my rights.
If you give me shit, he's gonna
drag your ass into court.
Don't worry, Mr. Simms.
I look weird, but
otherwise I'm real normal.
Everything will be cool.
Thanks a lot.
See you next week.
Mom.
What?
We have a lawyer
named B.D. Higgins?
Yeah. Bulldozer.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, you're a lawyer, Doze.
Bullshit rules!
Whoo-hoo!
Okay.
Cranium circumference:
67 centimeters.
Sixty-seven centimeters.
Last one, kid.
Yeah.
All right, Billy.
Mandible:
32.5 centimeters.
Mandible: 32.5.
That's good news.
Let me measure yours.
Rocky, since
your last checkup
in April,
your jaw measurement
only increased
1/8th of an inch.
Wow! I'm cured.
I'm healed. I can go home now.
It's the water in Azusa.
Picture time!
He knows this routine
better than we do.
Oh, wait.
Hold on a second.
Rocky, you look great.
I wanna get
my hair perfect.
You look fine, Rocky.
Okay, shoot.
Okay.
How's your mom,
Rocky?
She's great.
Stand still.
Oh, sorry.
Turn now.
Why don't you fill me
in on this, Doctor?
The patient was
first diagnosed...
With craniodiaphyseal
dysplasia...
at four years of age...
You can turn around.
When it was discovered
that calcium was depositing
at an abnormal rate...
Calcium.
My pal calcium.
Throughout his skull.
- And what have we learned
about this disorder?
- It's extremely rare,
one in approximately
22 million births.
Twenty-two million.
- How was it first described?
- I know.
They call it "lionitis"...
means "look of the lion."
You new around here?
Yes, I am. Cause?
It's caused by two
recessive genes...
and happens to the offspring
of normal parents.
His mother had
an uneventful pregnancy,
didn't ingest any chemical
substance or teratogen
during gestation.
That means it wasn't
my mom or dad's fault.
- Hello, Rocky.
- Hey, Doc Rudinsky.
Good to see you again.
How's it going?
Our data on this patient
supports your article in
the New England Journal...
How are you feeling
today, Rocky?
Good. How are you feeling?
Ehh. You still have
those headaches?
Yeah. They've been
getting pretty bad lately.
Hmm. Is your mother still
using the same method?
Yeah.
Uh, what methods
are those?
Well, she talks to 'em,
and they go away.
No medication?
Nope.
We're ready now, Doctor.
You can get
dressed now, Rocky.
See you later, Doc.
Do you have
any questions?
When you gonna invent one
of these things so a guy's rear end
isn't always hanging out?
Excuse me.
May I see these?
I'd like to do the follow-up
counseling with that
patient's mother myself.
Now there's a great idea.
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?
Oh, definitely, yes.
Dr. Cameron, pick up line two.
Dr. Cameron, line two.
Uh, Mrs. Dennis?
What?
I'm Dr. Vinton.
I need to talk to you
about the test results.
All right.
Hey, Mom.
Hey, babe.
Why doesn't
he wait outside.
What for?
So we can talk.
Talk.
It's about the
test results... on him.
Oh, him.
Him, by the way,
has got a name,
so if you got some information
for him, I suggest
you give it to him.
You don't understand.
No, you don't understand.
He's got a cheeseburger waiting
with his name on it, so I
suggest you hurry this along.
Well, as you know, plastic
surgery is not an option...
until the skull stops
thickening, and there's
no evidence that it will.
The cranium
is growing at such
an accelerated rate,
creating pressure
on the spinal cord
to such an extent that...
the prognosis
is not good.
We, uh, feel that
life expectancy is...
Three to six months.
You're not really gonna give us
that life expectancy
number again, are ya?
You know, for 12 years
I've been listening
to you guys bullshit.
First you told me that
he was retarded, then you said
he was gonna be blind and deaf.
Then you told me he'd never
be able to do anything
regular kids could do.
If I had dug his grave
every time one of you geniuses
told me he was gonna die,
I'd be eatin' fucking
chop suey in China by now.
Anything else?
Bye.
Looks like it's time
to get Dozer to give blood.
Take your stick.
Never has before.
Here comes Dozer's
welcoming committee.
Come on now, Doze.
Red Cross needs some blood.
Come on. It's only
gonna hurt for a second.
Go on, Dozer! Run!
Hey, Rusty!
Look who's here.
The prodigal son returns.
Hey, Rocky.
Ben, when did
you get back?
Yesterday.
He's looking good.
Yeah.
Better than he acts.
Oh, well.
How's your dad?
He was great.
Great for you,
shitty for me.
Here it goes.
Usual crapola's starting.
Watch your mouth.
Hey, you got baseball cards.
I just started
collecting those.
Me too.
You did not just start.
You didn't tell me
Ben was coming home.
It's a surprise to me too.
You happy about it?
Not especially. He's acting
just like his father.
I think the only reason
he's back is his father didn't
wanna pay the bills anymore.
Of course, 18 months
out of 16 years...
doesn't seem like a hell
of a lot to me, but...
Well, who needs them,
you know?
If you take their money,
you gotta take their shit.
The doctor say the usual?
Screw him. He eats everything
that ain't tied down.
That Ben's getting
a real smart mouth on him.
It's the age.
They think they
know everything.
Good slap upside the head,
and he don't know everything.
I never hit Rocky.
I don't believe this, Ben.
You don't even have
a Steve Garvey.
A Steve Garvey,
for Christ's sake.
I do.
I must have left it
at my dad's in Michigan.
You probably lost it.
Garvey's batting
.325 this year.
He's an important card.
You gotta have a Garvey.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, do I have
anything you want?
Nah, we better forget it.
You know, I feel
really bad about this, Ben.
We grew up together.
I should just give you
my Steve Garvey.
You know, I will,
for anything you got.
Anything, like this one.
Who the hell's
"Rubie" Walker?
I think that's
an old Dodger before
they came out to L.A.
Yeah? Well, I'll take it.
My grandpa likes them.
Come on, Doze.
Red Cross needs blood!
Take another stick.
Hey, you remember
we used to talk about
riding Harleys across Europe?
Yeah, I remember.
Well, I had been planning
on going by myself,
but now that you're back...
Yeah. That'd be great.
Anything to
get out of school.
Get that big fag!
Wow, puppies. Oh, cool.
Look at that one.
Can I pet him?
- Take your pick.
- Hi, puppy.
Now he was born
for you, Rocky.
I gotta ask my mom.
Come on, Ben.
Be right back.
I'll save him
for ya.
Try this.
And what's so special
about this, John?
Now this little baby
is dusted with angel wings.
Mom?
What?
I gotta show
you something.
Wait a second.
Am I interrupting
something?
What do you want?
Well, this lady's got
these really cool puppies.
You seen 'em, Doze?
No puppy. No dog.
Why?
'Cause you never
talk to the cat.
You don't feed the goldfish,
the bird or the rabbit.
I'll feed the dog. I promise.
Read my lips, Rock.
No.
There he is!
Go get him!
What's with the big guy?
Is he a dummy
or something?
Dozer just doesn't
like to talk.
Oh.
Hey, well, show her
the other stuff.
Take your pick.
Don't let them bother you.
I mean, my mom's
a pain in the ass also.
I don't believe this.
What?
It's Gar.
Oh, yeah.
Come on.
Hey, look,
it's Gar.
Is that Rocky's dad?
No. I was married
to Rocky's dad.
Who the hell is that?
Just a guy
I used to know.
Damn, it's good
to see you.
Where have you been?
Been on the road.
Damn, you're gettin' taller.
She must be pouring that
health food shit into you.
She is.
Don't cut yourself.
Thanks.
You been okay?
Yeah.
Still planning
a Europe run?
More than ever.
We were just talking about this.
God, this is so weird.
Yeah, isn't it?
How's everybody
else doin'?
Like who?
Like Grandma
and Grandpa.
They're okay. They don't
get around much anymore
'cause it's such a long drive.
We moved, you know.
Oh, yeah?
She talks about you.
Yeah, I'll bet she does.
Go on. Benny's waiting
for you.
Get out of here.
I'll see you later.
See you later, Gar.
See ya, Rock.
Hey, mama, toss me a beer.
T.J.
Gar.
Aren't you gonna
introduce me to your lady?
Yeah.
Angel, this is Gar.
Give him a kiss.
Handshake will do.
You sure?
That a way, Dozer.
Get 'em.
Way to go, Dozer.
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, Dozer.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, babe.
Good night, Bone.
Good night, buddy.
Clunk.
Beautiful.
Marseilles.
Marseilles, Marseilles,
Marseilles, Marseilles.
Oh, my God.
Hey, puppy.
Oh, my God.
Look at you.
Bone?
Dozer?
Yeah.
Scooch over.
I'm gonna make
that fat bastard
eat 30 pounds of dog food.
Trouble is,
he'll probably love it.
Hey, Rock, honey,
your limo's here.
Will you turn that
stuff down, Mom?
Okay.
I don't wanna go, Mom.
Then don't go.
But I gotta go.
Then go.
This is... This is easy
for you to say, Mom.
You're not the one
who's gonna be going
to some school...
where kids are gonna run
in the other direction when
they see you, making fun of you.
Yeah? When they stop
running and making fun,
they'll get to know you...
and think you're terrific,
just like at your other school.
You know, it takes time
for people to get to
like each other.
I don't know why you think
it should be different
for you.
But I am different, Mom.
Yeah. You're more
beautiful on the inside
than most people.
Anybody can't see that...
Screw 'em.
Right. Spoken like the true
son of a redheaded woman.
You're weird, Mom.
Get out of here.
Hey, Dozer.
Thanks, Doze. No, no, no.
I gotta do this alone.
Have a good day.
Hey, kid, why don't
you take off your mask?
All right.
Well, welcome back,
ninth graders.
Okay.
Now, we have two
new students with us
in homeroom this year.
First, we have
Miss Nancy Lawrence.
Where are you, Nancy?
Where are you, Nancy?
Hi, Nancy.
Wow! Thanks a lot.
Our other new student
is Mr. Rocky Dennis,
also in the back.
Wow. Thanks a lot.
See you later.
Bye.
Dempsey, Eric.
Locker number 137.
Combination: Right 46,
left past 46 to 16,
right to four.
Got it all?
Mm-hmm.
Dennis, Rocky.
Locker number 138.
Combination: Left 22,
right past 22 to 12,
left to nine.
You're not
writing it down.
Don't need to.
He looks like Frankenstein.
What's the matter? Haven't
you guys ever seen anybody
from the planet Vultern before?
Beep, beep-beep.
Beep, beep-beep.
That guy's weird, man.
Cut it out, guys.
Forty-six, four, five.
Dick wack!
Is it stuck?
No.
Eric, you're taking
forever. Excuse me.
I lost the goddamn combination.
That's okay.
Try right 46,
left past 46 to 16,
right to four.
Huh?
Right to 46,
left to 16,
to four.
We got enough candy here
to feed an orphanage.
I'll sell mine at school.
What?
More money for the trip.
Oh, yeah. Hey, maybe
I'll sell some of mine.
Come on, come on.
Let's dance.
Hey, Red!
Hey, Rocky,
what a haul.
I got you a present.
You got a Baby Ruth
in there?
For you, man.
Anything for your diet.
How's the kids?
What's to drink?
Hi!
Party time.
- Hey, Rock.
- Hey, Gar!
Thanks. Take this in your room
and open it up.
Okay. Thanks.
Oh, I forgot.
Red slipped me a fiver
for the strongbox.
How much we got saved
in here now?
Thirty-one bucks.
Plus the six we got
for baby-sitting tonight.
Plus the five Red slipped me.
So we got 44.
Forty-two.
Forty-two.
Yeah.
Whoa!
Check this out.
Tear that old sucker
off the wall.
Let's put this thing up.
I am really getting
into this now.
I wish we could just get out
of here and go tomorrow.
Me too.
Wow. You know, Gar always
said the best run was
right here across Europe.
He rode across
all by himself.
You should get some
of those little things...
Map tacks.
Right.
I want to go to every place
I've ever read about,
all those great cities
our relatives came from.
Not mine, Rock.
We're Americans.
Only the Indians were
Americans first. The rest of us
come from somewhere else,
like Paris, maybe,
or London...
or Rome,
Vienna, Barcelona...
Oh, yeah.
Like my grandparents...
are from Hungary or
Budapest or something.
Budapest is in Hungary, Ben.
No kidding.
Is it?
That jacket's the only thing
of yours that's ever gonna be
on my bed again.
Okay with me, baby.
What the hell did you
come back here for anyway?
Winters are
too cold back East,
and I wanted
to see... Rocky.
Can someone tell me how
the Trojan War began?
Those lightbulbs
over your heads
are blinding me.
Okay, Rocky.
Give it a shot.
Well, there was this
huge wedding, right?
And all the beautiful
goddesses in the world
were invited,
all except
for this one goddess.
She got really pissed off.
That's the fact part.
Now, the myth part goes that
she sent this golden apple...
that said,
"For the most beautiful,"
to the wedding,
and this dude named Paris
was supposed to judge
who should get the apple.
Right? Kind of like
a Miss Goddess contest.
He's the only judge.
He was a lucky guy.
Of course, all the goddesses
wanna get picked, right?
So one of 'em
goes up to Paris and says,
"Look, man, if you pick me,
I'm gonna give you this
really hot wench named Helen."
Except Helen was already
married to someone else.
Didn't matter.
Paris saw her and flipped out
because she was
just so beautiful.
She had a perfect body
and this face...
a face that could launch
a thousand ships.
Somebody said that.
So anyway, her old man
had this huge, hollow,
wooden horse built,
and puts all his armies into it,
and wheels it over to Troy,
and says,
"Hey, man, we got a present
for you. Open the gates."
They open the gates,
wheel in this horse and say,
"Wow. Big horse."
And they all fall asleep.
Nighttime comes,
and the horse opens up,
and all the armies come out,
and then...
And that's how
the Trojan War began.
Something like that.
- Thank you, Rocky.
It was very impressive.
- Thanks.
Now, along those lines, class,
let me read you something
from a book that's not...
Not bad, Dennis.
How about helping me?
What do you mean?
Tutor me.
This guy almost
flunked me last year.
It's gonna cost ya.
Huh?
Three bucks an hour.
Three bucks?
Three bucks?
Hey, I don't work
for free.
Better pay the three bucks,
cheapskate. You need all
the help you can get.
Thanks a lot.
Hi, Mom.
Hi.
Oh, Mom. I got an "A"
on a poem I wrote
in English class.
You've been a busy
little boy, haven't you?
Want me to read it to you?
Why not?
Are you going out
again tonight?
Yeah, but go ahead
and read it.
I'm listening.
Okay.
"These things are good:
Ice cream and cake,
a ride on a Harley,
seeing monkeys in the trees,
the rain on my tongue,
and the sun
shining on my face.
These things...
These things are a drag:
Dust in my hair,
holes in my shoes,
no money in my pocket,
and the sun
shining on my face."
Is that it?
Can I talk to you
for a minute, Mom?
I said I was going out.
You're always going out.
I told you
to take down the tree.
What's wrong, Mom?
You've been acting like
you hate me for a whole week.
What did I do?
You didn't do the dishes.
I'll do the dishes later.
Do the goddamn dishes now.
Don't go out tonight.
I wouldn't do that again
if I were you.
I hate you going out
all the time and coming home
wasted out of your mind!
It's none of your
goddamn business!
You're my mother!
Yeah? Well, you're
not my warden!
I can't hack this. You're
always watching me, telling me
how to live my life.
I never tell you
how to live your life.
The fuck you don't!
What's this? What do you
call these? I found these
all over the house.
They were planted everywhere
but in my goddamn
Christmas stocking!
I don't want you
taking drugs!
Don't!
How could you do that?
I hate you.
All you care about
are these stupid cards.
All you care about is
getting loaded and laid.
You wanna
shut the door?
What, were you
born in a barn?
What's the problem?
Shut up. It's my kid.
Wait for me.
I don't wait for nobody.
Then get the hell out.
No problem, baby.
No problem.
Mom. It hurts.
Where does it hurt, baby?
In the back, mostly.
All right, pick something.
I'm sorry about
what I said today.
Pick something.
I can't think, Mom.
It hurts.
Don't think.
Just pick something.
Uh...
The trip with Ben.
How?
Boat.
Okay. Now see it
and tell me.
Uh...
Tramp steamer, big,
black.
Has a red bottom,
and paint's all
chipping off.
Yeah.
Me and Ben on the deck.
We're cleaning
something.
Uh...
The sky's blue.
It's a bit cloudy.
And the ocean, it's dark.
Come on.
Smells good.
Uh, we leave to Spain
in the morning.
Mm-hmm.
I check the bikes.
Tell me about the bikes.
Uh, mine's a 74-inch
Shovelhead...
Mm-hmm.
With a suicide shift,
bright red,
Mm-hmm.
Ape hangers
shoulder high.
Now what are you gonna do?
Make myself well.
Good night, Ma.
You okay?
Yeah.
Thanks for last night.
Gar called this morning.
Said he wants to take
you to the carnival.
Are you coming?
Maybe.
It's okay, baby.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Yeah. I'm sorry about
your baseball card.
That's okay. I have
two others just like it.
You little shit.
I liked your poem, Rock.
I just get scared
for you, Mom.
Ah, don't be.
It's bad for you.
I can handle it, Rock.
What if somebody deals you
bad stuff, or what if
you take too much of something...
What are you, the director of
the Inland Valley Chemical...
No.
Dependency Center.
Yeah.
I get scared something's
gonna happen to you...
Well, don't. Just lay off.
Jesus Christ, okay.
Okay what?
Okay, I will cut it...
down.
Promise?
I said so, didn't I?
Don't push it.
All right. I used to be
a good swinger
when I was young.
Bumper cars!
I saw this amazing
74-inch Harley Knucklehead.
We better
check it out.
Yes!
Gar, you gonna
go on this?
Wouldn't miss it, kid.
All right.
Mom, you gonna ride?
No, babe. You go ahead.
Hey, Rusty. Look what
Dozer won for you.
Hey, Doze,
it's great.
I can use this for
after-dinner mints.
Hey, let's ride
those bumpers.
Yeah!
Anybody else
wanna go ride 'em?
No. Let the boys play.
Uh, you can ride, kid,
but I can't take the blame...
for what happens
to retard here.
I can't take the blame
for what happens
to you, can I?
Huh?
Take the tickets.
Mom!
Babe, this remind you
of anything?
Yeah. A bunch of guys
running around in circles.
Uh-huh.
Goin' nowhere.
Yeah, except my Rocky.
Can I have
a small lemonade, please?
How would you like
something nice
to wash down with that?
No, thanks, John.
Real high-quality stuff.
I promised my kid.
You promised your kid?
I like that.
I'm gonna put that with
"I promised my parole officer"
and "I promised my wife."
Put it anywhere
you want to, John.
You know where to find me.
Watch it.
Did you see
where Mom went?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
Have a good time.
Hey, Babe.
There's something
I've been wanting to give you.
You picked a hell of a time.
I can't take that, Red.
That's your good luck charm.
I kind of think of you
as my good luck charm, Babe.
Well, if you put it that way.
Will you wear it?
Sure.
Okay.
There.
Sentimental old bastard,
aren't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, you guys.
Are you in here?
Shit.
Get any dope
for me, lady?
I didn't get any.
Yeah?
What, you don't
believe me?
Should I?
Hey, I...
Oh, check it out.
Mirrors.
Whoo!
Thanks.
Hi, Rocky.
I'm getting dizzy.
Ben.
What?
Look at me.
Huh?
Get behind me
and look at me.
Whoa.
Get my mom.
What?
Rusty, how about
one of the old numbers?
It's okay with me, Red.
Rock, what do you think?
What?
Little Egypt.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Ladies and gentlemen,
step right up.
See Little Egypt do her famous
dance of the pyramids.
She walks, she talks.
She crawls on her belly
in the dirt like a reptile. Wow.
You gotta love her for doing this.
She's my mom.
Put your hands together
for Miss Rusty Dennis.
Whoa.
 Hey, Gar.
 Hey, Rock.
Whoa!
Good year.
Where are you going?
I'm going where you ain't been.
That's where I'm going.
You ain't going nowhere.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Come on, Rusty.
Sing another one.
You know, you did
a terrific job with
the decorating committee, Rocky.
Thanks.
You going to the prom?
I don't know.
Hi, Rocky.
Howdy.
How are finals going?
Pretty good, Mr. Simms.
I had a great idea for you.
How about a couple of weeks
at summer camp?
I don't think so,
Mr. Simms.
I'm saving up
for something else.
It wouldn't cost you a cent.
A friend of mine
is a director of the camp
for the junior blind,
and he could use a C.A.
For the July session.
What's a C. A?
Counselor's aide.
You help the counselors
with the little kids,
and you get
to go free.
Little blind kids?
Most of em.
Hey, Rocky. I got an "A"
on my algebra test.
- You owe me 14 bucks.
- I got Roy Campanella for you.
It's a deal.
I tutor him.
Oh.
Well, how about
the camp, Rocky?
I don't think so, Mr. Simms.
My mom kind of needs me here.
Somehow, Rocky,
your mother's never given
me the impression...
that she can't take
care of herself.
Well, that's not what I meant.
I kind of organize things
for her.
You know, just kind of
keep things together.
Yeah. I guess
you probably do.
Well, will you at least
think about it?
Okay, I'll think about it.
Good.
Bye-bye.
You okay, Rock?
Hi, baby.
Mom, what would you
think about me
if you were a girl?
That's a toughie,
but let me see.
I don't know. I'd think
you're pretty cute.
I like guys with red hair.
I wanna talk to another
plastic surgeon.
One said you couldn't
do anything until
your bones stopped growing.
I know.
Well, what is that, Rock?
Two years at the most? We've
been doing this for 16 years.
Don't you understand
anything, Mom?
It's girls!
Will you give me a beer?
Come on.
Now, wait.
I don't want to wake up...
oh, shit... my old man.
Shh. Shh. Come on.
This is serious.
Rocky? Rocky, honey,
come on. Wake up.
You got a guest.
Come on, Screech.
Come on, boy.
Geez, what happened
to your face?
W-W-What do you want?
The lady brought me here.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I don't believe
she did this.
Well?
- Well, what?
- What do you want?
You don't happen to have
a Carl Furillo, do you?
Huh?
No, it's just a joke.
Do you wanna sit down?
Mind if I smoke?
How old are you?
Nineteen.
How... How much do you get?
Depends.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Well, how-how much
for a basic?
Twenty-five.
Is that it?
You need a business manager.
No, thanks. I already
got one of those.
Why is your map
all stuck with pins?
Those are all the places
I'm gonna go.
I'm going to Seattle,
Washington.
Yeah?
Yep, as soon
as I get enough money.
Seattle?
Yeah, I got a sister
that lives there.
I get postcards.
It's real wet and clean.
What happened
to your face?
I used to do
a lot of drugs.
No shit?
No, I'm...
I'm just kidding.
Oh.
Where the hell
have you been?
Getting something for Rocky.
Uh-huh.
And me.
I hope it was worth
that 40 bucks you took
out of my jeans.
I remember a time
when you weren't above...
copping a couple bucks
for some snort.
I've grown up since then.
Forty bucks?
You want to take it
out in trade?
Are you all right?
Mm-hmm.
You know, my mama used
to say some people were
born with no place to go.
I don't believe that.
Then how do you explain
all the rotten things
that happen to people?
I don't know.
You know, Lorrie,
I hope you don't
mind me saying this,
but I think you got
a really shitty attitude.
It's pretty negative.
It is, huh?
Yeah. And if you think
like that, then things
will only get worse.
When something
bad happens to you,
you gotta remember something
good that's happened.
Like what?
Well, I got a bunch
of em that I use.
Like the time that we
all went down to Mexico,
or the way my grandma's
kitchen smells.
I don't think I have any.
Everyone's gotta have
at least one, for Christ's sake.
Well, maybe the time...
Nah, I don't know.
Lorrie, I hope you don't think
that I don't like you
or anything, 'cause I do.
You're really pretty
and nice and stuff.
It's just that
I thought it would be...
with someone that I was
in love with, you know?
You know what?
I just thought of one.
Yeah?
Yeah.
When I was in fifth grade,
we had to paint
these pictures...
of a pine tree
with snow on it.
Mine was the best one.
The teacher, she put it
on the wall by the door...
where all the kids
could see it.
She put a big
gold star on it.
And all the kids
saw it.
You want some
more toast, Lorrie?
I gotta go to work.
Oh, Gar. Can you give her
a ride to the bus stop?
Yeah, sure.
Come on, Lorrie.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye, Rocky.
Mom?
Do I look like
a freak to you?
No.
You've always been real big
on telling me my face doesn't
matter, but it does, doesn't it?
You think that I can't
even get a girl to like me
unless you pay for her.
That's not true.
Bullshit!
Bullshit yourself.
Lots of young guys
got problems getting girls.
What if I was your dad
and I did the same thing?
I'd hate that too.
I'm sorry, you know.
Maybe I was wrong.
Goddamn right you were.
But it had nothing
to do with your face.
Bullshit, Mom!
Rock, where
are you going?
Hey, Rocky!
 Rock.
Hey, Rock,
how's it going?
Hey, Rock.
