"...just as Eliza
was majestically removing..."
"...a fifty-pound banknote
from the drawer to her own purse..."
"...we were suddenly interrupted
by old MacDonald himself!"
"We called up all the winning dignity
of our sex to do what must be done."
"Sophia shrieked and fainted, and
I screamed and instantly ran mad."
"Finally, we regained our senses,
escaped and hastened to London."
"We began to think
of returning to our mothers,"
"but accidentally heard
that they had both..."
"...starved to death!"
Fanny!
Goodbye, Susy.
Think of lots of good stories for me
and eat thousands of tarts.
And you, little girl, continue to brush
your hair, but not all off.
Fanny, he's here.
Wake up. Say goodbye to your sister.
- Sorry for the delay.
- Hurry along, then.
- Goodbye!
- Come on, I ain't got all day.
- Bye!
- Goodbye, Mama.
- Give my regards to my sisters.
- Yes, Mama.
And you will write to tell me
when I'm to return?
Mama?
Get on now!
- Bye!
- Bye, Susy!
Bye!
Bye!
Do you hear that?
Black cargo, Miss.
- Black cargo?
- Aye. Slaves.
Probably some captain
or heroic ship doctor...
...brought home some darkies
as gifts for the wife.
Get on there!
Whoa! Stand!
Hello!
- Hello!
- It's 5 o'clock in the morning.
A Mrs Norris arranged
for this girl to be brought here.
- It's her niece or something.
- Mrs Norris lives in the parsonage.
I was told to drop her
at the entrance of Mansfield Park.
Then drop her.
- You must be my aunt, Aunt Norris.
- Yes, yes...
He brought you two hours too early.
Come in.
Ellis, gather up the children.
Now, let us have a look at you.
Well...I'm sure
you have other qualities.
Sir Thomas, she's here.
Our new little charge.
- Hello, Fanny.
- Hello, Sir Thomas.
- Greetings from my family.
- Thank you. How was your journey?
Lovely, sir. I'd no idea
England was so big.
But you came, what?
A hundred miles?
- Yes, sir. Impressive.
- lndeed, it is.
Well, get her settled in with you,
and we'll introduce the children later.
With Mr Norris and myself?
- Yes...I thought...
- No, no, no.
There's been a misunderstanding.
When I suggested
we take in my poor niece...
Please do not trouble yourself
on my behalf.
You speak when you are spoken to.
Would you excuse us, Miss Price?
Good morning.
I am Maria Elizabeth Bertram.
And I am Julia Frances Bertram.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Pleased to meet you.
Mr Norris could no more tolerate
the noise of a child than he could fly!
But it might not be wise to have her
in the house with the boys.
If you breed her up with them, though
she may have the beauty of an angel,
she'll never be more to either
than a sister.
I suppose there's truth to that.
It's settled.
Maria, Julia, listen...
We must prepare ourselves
for gross ignorance,
some meanness of opinion
and a certain vulgarity of manner.
- These aren't incurable faults.
- I hope she won't tease my Pug.
I've just persuaded Julia
to leave him alone.
But you girls must never be
arrogant towards her.
She is not your equal.
But that must never
be apparent to her.
- It is a point of great delicacy.
- Great delicacy, yes.
Dining parlour through there.
Conservatory there. Cellars there.
I hope you don't tend toward sulkiness.
Your mother had the inclination.
Clearly marrying
to disoblige her family.
That's the west wing.
Soon to be repaired if Tom could
set aside his horses and dice!
The billiard room.
For the men, of course.
Remember there is moderation
in all things.
Yes... Tom did it of himself.
Very modern... Very modern...
Sir Thomas' extraordinary library.
Come along, we haven't got all day.
And here is Sir Thomas' study.
Never disturb him here.
He's weighed down
with some great cares.
This is his personal sanctuary.
The maids' rooms.
Manservants' rooms down there.
You will be my assistant,
you understand.
And here, what was formerly
the nursery and the governor's room,
is now your very own room!
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
How long am I expected
to remain here?
That depends, doesn't it?
But if all goes well...for ever.
"Dear Susy, it seems
that Mother has given me away. "
"And I can augur nothing but misery
from all I've seen at Mansfield Park. "
Don't worry. I'm all for crying.
It makes your hair grow.
Don't make fun of me.
Is it working?
- Is what working?
- My behaviour.
- Is it making you feel better?
- It's certainly distracting.
Good... Anyway, I'm Edmund.
So, who do you miss?
"I told Edmund
about you especially, Susy. "
"He asked me if I wished to write
to you. I said I had no paper. "
"And didn't he give me enough for more
stories than you should ever want!"
"By the way,
Eliza eloped to Paris with her lover."
"Unfortunately,
she lived beyond her means"
"and was imprisoned and partially
eaten by her two young sons."
"But she intends
to murder the guards."
"I'll keep you abreast
of any further developments."
"PS..."
"Could you please assure Mother
that I am improving myself daily?"
The history of England.
Henry Vl.
It was in this reign
that Joan of Arc lived
and made such a fuss
among the English.
They should not have burnt her,
but they did.
Henry Vlll...
I'll save you the task of hearing
what you've already heard,
and myself of recounting
what I do not perfectly recollect,
justice and duty...
That disgrace to humanity,
that pest of society, Elizabeth,
who, murderess and wicked queen
that she was,
confined her cousin, the lovely
Mary, Queen of Scots, for 1 9 years,
and then brought her to an untimely,
unmerited and scandalous death.
Much to the eternal shame of the
monarchy and the entire kingdom.
"By a partial, prejudiced
and ignorant historian."
- Fanny, you're awful!
- All those wars!
The men all good for nothing,
and hardly any women at all.
Very tiresome.
It's odd that history should be so dull.
A great deal of it must be invention.
I shall have to bend your supple mind
in more strict a fashion.
I think the situation calls for some...
...Shakespeare!
Fanny Price!
Please try to act with some decorum!
What?
What?
So you like her?
Mrs Shakespeare, she's my refuge.
I can't thank you enough.
My gifts are nothing next to yours.
My writing is wood
compared to your wild constructions.
Yes, I'm a wild beast!
I'm sure Sir Thomas would agree.
Don't concern yourself with his gravity.
He has much to preoccupy him.
Such as?
Edmund!
- It's complex.
- And I'm too simple?
Fanny!
He regrets taking me in, doesn't he?
No, it's...
It's just it's problems with the slaves
on the plantation.
- The abolitionists are making inroads.
- That's a good thing, isn't it?
Well, we all live off the profits, Fanny.
Including you.
Tom, you mustn't be serious!
Come back!
Tom!
You will do as I say!
What, and do as you do?
Even I have principles, sir!
Tom!
You are an angel.
Tom!
"Dear Susy,
news items... "
"Sir Thomas has dragged Tom
to the West lndies to..."
"...protect our interests there."
"Maria has found herself a fiance,
a Mr Rushworth, "
"who Sir Thomas
has approved by post. "
"Everyone seems delighted with him,
except Edmund, who says, "
"'If he had not £1 2,000 a year,
we'd think him prodigiously dim. "'
"Consequently, there's an urgency
for Julia to search for a suitor. "
"And Mrs Norris' husband died..."
"...which did not seem
to inconvenience her at all. "
"She's moved into Mansfield proper,
where life is decidedly less expensive."
"What joy is mine! So..."
"Now there is a new parson
moved into the parsonage, and... "
"...Iife seems nothing more than
a quick succession of busy nothings."
They are half-brother and -sister
to the parson's wife.
Entertain them with suitable
attention and animation.
Not to mention alacrity!
I might need the rest of the morning
to recover from the ball last night.
- I'm just a mite sluggish.
- lndeed!
Mr Russel, if you please!
May I introduce Miss Mary Crawford?
And her brother, Mr Henry Crawford.
This is my sister, Lady Bertram.
Mr Edmund Bertram.
This is Miss Julia Bertram,
who's just come out into society,
as Miss Maria Bertram, here, has just
become engaged to Mr Rushworth.
Perhaps you passed Mr Rushworth's
magnificent estate on your way.
The one with the spectacular gardens,
Sotherton?
Actually, we're planning
some improvements.
And Fanny Price.
Well...you certainly seem a dreary lot!
Please, do join us
in our game, Mr Crawford.
- Well...?
- I like them both exceedingly.
But I like Julia best.
Why?
Because her Aunt Norris advised me
that it must be so!
She seems very ready
to be fallen in love with.
Though Maria is most agreeable.
- Though her choice is made.
- Yes...
And I like her the better for it.
An engaged woman is always more
agreeable than a disengaged.
She is satisfied with herself.
Her cares are over, and she may exert
all her powers of pleasing
without suspicion.
All is safe with a lady engaged.
No harm can be done.
You allow yourself great latitude
on such points, Henry.
But you will be the one
taken in at last.
"'l cannot know
if he loves me,' said Eliza."
"l asked, 'Did he never gaze
on you with admiration?"'
"'Tenderly press your hand?
Drop a tear and leave abruptly?"'
"'Never,' replied she."
"'He's always left the room
when his visit has been ended."'
Edmund... What do you think?
She's delightful.
They're both delightful.
There could be no harm
in my liking an agreeable man.
- Everyone knows my situation.
- Must you always win?
Even when you already
have your prize?
There will be disappointments.
If one scheme of happiness fails...
...human nature turns to another.
You may need your pretty philosophy
in the end, Maria.
Pity Tom, the eldest, is not here.
Or his £20,000 and his baronetcy!
Henry! You know those things
mean nothing to me.
Shall we stay on a while?
Hmm, yes, please.
I must say, the pleasures of life rarely
transcend such a moment as this.
Don't you agree, Pugsie?
God damn you!
Tom, are you well?
Is there war? Where's Sir Thomas?
Edmund, come quickly!
Tom, what of Antigua?
Where's Father?
Antigua... All the lovely people there
paying for this party.
Tom, we thought you were in Antigua.
Oh, please!
Tom returned from Antigua
somewhat sooner than expected.
He spent a while in London. I found
him in the Covent Garden Theatre.
- A theatre?
- Yes. They're restaging this...
...delicious slice of naughtiness
called "Lovers' Vows".
I've heard of that.
Tom was a charming parasite until...
Well...he ran out of cash.
Since I sympathise with the tragedy
of unwarranted poverty,
I chose to deliver him to his family,
whom I now find to be so very...
...Ioving and beautiful.
And solvent.
Solvent?
Mr Bertram?
The baron meets the bastard son,
takes back his lover,
and they all live happily, I presume,
for some time ever after.
- Bravo, Tom!
- Well told, Tom!
More dim-witted fiction
to clutter the world.
Come now, Mr Bertram.
Drama is to life
what ships are to the sea.
A means to traverse it. To plumb
its depths, breadth and beauty.
I couldn't agree more.
Good drama, in which the greatest
powers of the mind are displayed,
in which the most thorough knowledge
of human nature, the liveliest wit,
are conveyed to the world
through the best chosen language.
This is essential.
This is trash!
He's so serious!
That is the worst charge, isn't it?
What do you think, Miss Price?
I'm sorry to disappoint,
but I do not have a ready opinion.
I suspect you are entirely composed
of ready opinions not shared.
Fanny.
- Yes, Aunt Norris?
- What are you doing here?
- I beg your pardon.
- The sewing wasn't cleared away.
You're quite right, it wasn't. I'll...
I'll see to it immediately.
Aunt Norris, surely
the sewing can wait?
Pray, is she out or is she not...
into society?
- I can't see that it matters terribly.
- Forget this nonsense.
Let's stage the play.
Here. Now. Together.
Yatesy, you're a genius.
Why, this is the very room
for a theatre.
And Father's study will
provide for an excellent stage!
It has been mentioned that I have
quite a gift for the stage...actually.
Tom, you're not serious?
Not serious? Me?
"Lover's Vows"? I'm convinced
that our father would disapprove.
I think I know our father
as well as you do.
Manage yourself and let me
take care of the rest of the family.
Don't act yourself if you
do not like it, but please...
...don't try to govern everybody else.
All settled, then?
- Good!
- What?
What's the matter?
I was not asleep.
No, of course not, ma'am.
No one suspected you.
Where's Fanny?
Mrs Norris, get me Fanny Price.
I wish to play Amelia.
But which gentleman am I to have
the pleasure of making love to?
Why has the wish to do what is right
become an unattractive quality?
And now Tom wants
Charles Maddox to play Anhalt.
He's about as discreet
as the town crier!
So this is where you hide. I need
some rehearsing. Would you mind...?
Mr Bertram! Hello.
Hello, Miss Crawford.
- I'll be off, then, Fanny.
- Stay, stay!
Stay! We need an audience.
We all need an audience,
don't we, Fanny?
I live in dread of audiences.
Come. I will play Amelia.
- And you will play Anhalt my teacher.
- No, no.
Read from there,
since Mr Bertram refuses. I insist.
Very well.
"For a long time,
you have instructed me."
- "Why should not I now teach you?"
- "Teach me what?"
"Whatever I know and you don't."
"There are some things
I'd rather never know."
"As you made certain mathematical
problems pleasant to me,"
"l might teach
something as pleasant to you."
"Woman herself is a problem."
"And I'll teach you to make her out."
"You teach?"
"Why not?"
"None but a woman can teach
the science of herself."
Upon reconsideration,
I cannot help but think that...
...despite the displeasure
of appearing inconsistent,
it would be better for me to play Anhalt
than invite Charles Maddox
into this mixture.
Excellent!
"There are some things
I would rather never know."
"What is this? How is this?"
"And why do I find
my mother thus? Speak."
"l cannot speak, my dear son."
"My dear Frederick,
I was not prepared."
"Dear Mother, compose yourself.
Now then..."
Put it down over there.
Hello, my sweet dear girl.
Welcome home, sir.
My word! You've grown in health.
And, I dare say, beauty.
Where are the rest, Julia and Maria?
What's that?
- Well, it's...
- lmprovements?
Baddeley.
Oh, you must be Sir Thomas!
I am Rushworth.
Your future son-in-law.
We are in the midst
of a home theatrical. I'm Count Cassel.
I come in with a blue dress
and a pink satin cloak...
...afterwards I have another fine suit
by way of a shooting dress.
I have two and forty speeches
which is...
...no trifle.
Father!
- Absolutely not!
- It won't be much.
Father...
Tom... So this is what you were
in such a hurry to leave Antigua for?
Oh, Sir Thomas...
I could not have borne
your absence a moment longer.
Come on!
"Dear Susy, all remnants
of the theatre have been erased, "
"and Tom and Yates have fled
the new solemnity that has returned. "
Do tell us more
about the Negroes, dear.
The mulattos are well-shaped, and
the women especially well-featured.
I have one, so easy and graceful in
her movements and intelligent as well.
Strangely, two mulattos
can never have children.
They're like mules in that respect.
Excuse me, Father, for contradicting
you, but that is nonsense.
- You cannot say such things.
- I did not say they are mules.
I said they are like mules.
Long's 'History of Jamaica'.
Read it before you challenge me.
I've a good mind to bring one back
with me to work here as a domestic.
Correct if I am in error, but if you were
to bring a slave back to England,
there would be some argument
whether or not they should be freed.
If I'm not mistaken...
I must say,
you've changed considerably.
I've done some reading on it... Thomas
Clarkson, under Edmund's guidance.
Fanny has a voracious mind,
as hungry as any man's.
And her writing is remarkable,
in a style entirely new.
Yes, good... Yes...
Your complexion is so improved.
I trust you will see as much
beauty of mind in time, Father.
You've gained so much countenance,
and your figure...
Please...
Don't you agree, Mr...Crawford?
- Purity is a decided attraction, true.
- lndeed.
Especially for the impure.
It must be the moral steadfastness
of her heart that illuminates her eyes.
- Please!
- Gentlemen...
Fanny is as fearful of notice and praise
as other women are of neglect.
- Most discerning, Miss Crawford.
- Thank you, Mr Bertram.
I have it! A ball at Mansfield Park
in honour of Fanny!
We shall introduce
Miss Fanny Price to society.
Some young man of good standing
will take notice.
She'll glide about with quiet elegance
and in admirable time.
You must excuse me.
I think I have something...
It needn't be a large affair,
just a few friends...
Fanny, don't be foolish, it is raining.
I see more distinctly through the rain.
- It's just a silly ball.
- I'll not be sold off like a slave!
Don't be an imbecile!
But imbecility in women is a great
enhancement to personal charms!
Fanny...
You're being irrational!
Another adornment.
I must be ravishing.
Fanny, you really must begin
to harden yourself to the idea of...
...being worth looking at.
- You could do worse, Edmund.
- Sir?
She is witty and bright,
and not without...worth.
- How might you measure that worth?
- Don't impress me with your purity.
Her family is well-established,
it is well known.
The Prices?
The Crawfords, Edmund.
I meant the Crawfords...
Mary Crawford.
What are you reading?
Laurence Sterne's
'A Sentimental Journey'.
May l?
"l was interrupted with a voice
which I took to be that of a child,"
"which complained
it could not get out."
"l looked up and down the passage
and saw a starling in a little cage."
"'l can't get out, I can't get out!'
said the starling."
"'God help thee,' said l.
'But I'll let thee out, cost what it will."'
"But it was double-twisted with wire,
and I had to pull the cage to pieces."
"l took both hands to it."
"The bird flew to where I was
attempting his deliverance,"
"and thrusting his head
through the trellis as if impatient,"
"'l fear, poor creature,' said l,"
"'l cannot set thee at liberty."'
"'No,' said the starling."
"'l can't get out. I can't get out,'
said the starling."
You read well.
Thank you.
Father, I wish to speak
to you about Rushworth.
Maria, yes...
Now, you know how eagerly disposed
I was to like your Mr Rushworth.
But you think him
an inferior young man.
As ignorant in business as in books
with opinions unfixed
and without seeming
much aware of it himself.
I'm not blind, Father.
Perhaps the alliance, advantageous
as it is, was too quickly agreed to.
You need not worry, Maria,
I shall take care of you.
Every inconvenience should be braved
and the connection given up,
if you feel yourself unhappy
in the prospect of it.
I will not pretend
he is of shining character.
But I will also not pretend
that enjoying a larger income,
a house in the city and all the other
amiable pleasures it will afford,
are not an attraction.
As for the rest...
Well, he's still young.
And...
...I would like to marry him
immediately.
Within a fortnight.
- I do not understand the urgency.
- I don't understand the delay.
I would like for Julia to accompany me
on the honeymoon.
You wish for Julia to accompany you
on your honeymoon?
She's never been to Brighton.
- Evening.
- Evening to you, sir.
"Dear Susy,
Maria was married on Saturday."
"ln all important preparations of mind,
she was complete."
"Prepared for matrimony
by a hatred of home,
"disappointed affection and contempt
of the man she was to marry."
"The bride was elegantly dressed and
the bridesmaids were duly inferior. "
"Her mother had her salts, expecting
to be agitated, and her aunt tried to cry. "
"Marriage is indeed
a manoeuvring business."
Goodbye, my precious!
Good luck!
Bye!
It is a comfort to think
you will never leave us, Fanny.
- My dear Fanny!
- Oh, no, no...
- I should take the apples to Mrs Norris.
- I want you to stay and play with me.
She must forgive me.
Selfishness must always be forgiven,
because there's no hope of a cure!
So lovely.
Tomorrow evening, the ballroom
shall be lit solely by your beauty.
You do have a fine form, my dear.
No wonder Edmund
so delights in your company.
I'm so evil he knows not
what to make of me.
Would that I had
your sound judgement.
Tell me...
- Does he speak of me?
- Occasionally.
Is that your harp in the front room?
Indeed. It was transported
from London on Henry's carriage.
I tried to hire a horse and cart,
but found I'd asked the most
unreasonable thing in the world!
I'd offended all the farmers,
the labourers and the hay in the parish.
Getting the hay in
is of great importance
in the country...at this time.
And music isn't?
It depends on the music, I suppose.
That's Edmund's favourite.
He seems very alive to music.
Yes...
Edmund says that in church it is music
that best allows the spirit...
...to aspire to the beyond.
Heavens!
Why waste it on drowsy church-goers
starched up into seeming piety?
Give me a concert or a dance.
I'm sure he'd agree.
Forgive me my contradiction,
but I'm sure he wouldn't.
When he takes orders in a few weeks,
he will begin his own services.
Takes orders?
Is Edmund to be a clergyman?
Yes.
But a clergyman is so drear.
A clergyman's wife is even worse!
What profession would you suggest,
Miss Crawford?
I'm not, as you know, the first born.
There must be an uncle or grandfather
to place you somewhere?
There is not.
Choose law, then, it's not too late.
At least you can distinguish yourself
there with language and wit.
I have no wish to blunder about
on the borders of empty repartee.
Your father could put you
into Parliament.
My father's choices
are less than compelling for me.
No, I wish to become a clergyman.
There are worse things than a life
of compassion and contemplation.
She doesn't think evil,
but she speaks it.
It grieves me to the soul.
The effect of education perhaps.
Perhaps I can uneducate her.
Fanny, would that more women
were like you.
I love you more than words can say.
I demand the first dance at the ball.
One's consequence varies so much
at times without any particular reason.
There's a reason for everything.
Your entire person is agreeable.
Yes. Well, tonight
I agree with everyone.
Edmund...
I think you should admit
you're in love with Fanny Price.
Of course I love her, but...
...there are as many forms of love
as there are moments in time.
Perfect! You dance like an angel,
Fanny Price.
One does not dance
like an angel alone, Mr Crawford.
A compliment?!
Let the heavens rejoice!
I complimented your dancing.
Keep your wig on!
- Thank you.
- See you soon.
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.
"A few hours
before Laura died, she said,"
"'Take warning from my unhappy end."'
"'Beware of fainting fits.
Beware of swoons."'
"'Run mad as often as you choose..."'
"'...but do not faint."'
- Good afternoon.
- Hello, Sir Thomas.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- My dear.
I've been thinking about the parsonage.
Not you, too?
Spades are trumps, Fanny.
- I'm all in the glow of a new scheme.
- And what might that be?
Might you rent the parsonage to me?
- But it is to be Edmund's.
- Anyone to purchase a queen?
- At what cost?
- Two shillings.
- Highway robbery!
- Mr Bertram could stay living here.
You can stay close to your family,
and I can continue to improve
and perfect my friendship and...
...intimacy
with the Mansfield Park family.
I have a better plan. Live here with us.
Stay as long as you wish.
Bring all your horses.
Your sister, too.
Be as one of our family.
- We'd thrive on it, wouldn't we, Fanny?
- Of course. A king for three shillings?
- I will.
- Mary! It's exorbitant!
I'll stake my last like a woman of spirit.
No cold prudence for me.
I was not made
to sit still and do nothing!
If I lose the game,
it shall not be for not striving for it.
Well done, Fanny!
Fanny! I must speak to you...
Yes, Mr Crawford?
You must know
why I intend to rent the parsonage.
I wish to continue improving
and perfecting my intimacy...
...with you!
You have created sensations which
my heart has never known before.
The one happiness in life
is to love and be loved.
Mr Crawford, do not speak nonsense!
Nonsense?
I'm afraid you may end
in convincing yourself!
Fanny... You are killing me!
No man dies of love but on the stage.
"The intimacy between them
daily increased,"
"till it grew to such a pitch that
they did not scruple to kick one another"
"on the slightest provocation."
Yes?
My sweet girl! This is a great day,
a great day indeed.
Yes... Is it?
You may make me more proud
than my own daughters.
Please don't say that, sir.
Why is there no fire here today?
- I'm not cold, sir.
- But you have a fire in general?
No, sir, but I have a warm shawl.
Your aunt cannot be aware of this.
I understand.
For as long as you're in my home,
Fanny Price, you shall have a fire.
I am aware that there has been
a misplaced distinction, but...
...I think too well of you to suppose
you will ever harbour resentment.
Thus, it is with more pleasure,
that I inform you that Henry Crawford
has asked my permission to marry you,
and I have given my blessing.
I'd no idea his feelings
had come to such a boiling point!
Clearly, I am too old to follow
the intricate manoeuvrings of the young.
Please get ready
and join me downstairs.
