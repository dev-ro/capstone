[silence]
 [fly buzzes]
 (Jack)
 Where is he?
 (Jack)
 He's a French dealer selling
 a case of liquid heroin.
 Ben, grab the drugs.
 Bobby's at the money.
 Me and Marshall
 will cover you till
 you get back to the car.
 Then we get
 the fuck out.
So my plan, basically.
You came to me,
remember?
 That's him.
 [gun cocked]
 [muffled yelling]
 [gunshot]
[shouting]
 [gunshot]
Bobby.
Sorry, mate.
 [tires screeching]
 (Jack)
 Bobby.
Bobby.
Fuck.
Bobby.
 (Marshall)
 Jack.
Bobby.
 Bobby is gone, Jack.
 We need to leave now.
 Come on.
 Come on, now.
Hi.
Hi, sweetie pie.
 How's my beautiful godson?
 Yes.
[whispering]
Come here.
Hi, sweet pie.
I missed you.
You're late.
Now I'm going
to be late.
 Nice to see you, too.
Someone has been crying
his little head off
all morning.
The bloody
washing machine's broken.
I'm having to wash
everything in the sink.
Speaking of which--
 Don't push
 your luck, Mommy.
Godmothers babysit,
we buy presents,
we don't do laundry.
Someone's very grumpy.
You got your period?
 No.
It's sushi night,
actually.
 You're not still
 doing that, are you?
 Yeah.
You might as well wear
a T-shirt saying,
"Hi, I'm ovulating.
Do you want to fuck?"
What's the romance in that?
 Darling, you do know,
 if I had the money, I'd--
Well, actually,
I'd first go buy
a new washing machine,
but then after that
I'd pay for you
to go private.
 I'd IVF you a baby.
How's Tom?
He's just spending
every waking minute
at the house.
You're so lucky
to have him.
And you're so lucky
to have him.
 (Mike)
 Tom. Tom.
You up there?
What you doing?
Didn't you hear me?
Job I just finished
had a little extra.
 Thought you
 could use them.
You all right, mate?
I think we're going
to lose the house.
 Oh, shit.
I thought you were
coming along.
 Yeah.
Not far enough.
Pumped all
the money into it.
Half my budget
went into this
fucking dry rot.
What does Anna say?
I haven't told her, yet.
She only knows half of what
I spent and she's already
freaking out.
We're trying to start a family.
Can't even afford the rent
on our apartment.
Just talk to her, mate.
She'll understand.
Come on.
If you're up for it,
a friend of mine needs some
painting done next week.
Won't pay much, but--
Yeah.
Thanks.
It's a good thing
I have a Master's degree.
Come in handy.
See you, bud.
Tom Wright?
Yeah.
You're served.
We've got two weeks?
Thanks.
[muffled music]
Ben.
Turn it down.
 [door closes]
 (Anna)
 Hello?
 [door opens]
Hi.
Hi.
It's, uh, sushi night?
 You forgot.
No. No.
I never forget
sushi night.
It's fine.
Nice wine.
 It was just
 a few quid extra.
A very nice wine.
 And I thought
 it was worth it.
Of course
it's worth it.
Come here.
Sushi night.
How's Julian?
He's...loud and--
Tonight,
Yeah?
someone's going
to get pregnant.
Hey.
You okay?
We're going to lose
the house.
No.
No.
We're going
to work it out.
 Mike just got me
 a few days on a good job.
Maybe it's time
we go back.
No.
 No.
Tom.
This was my idea.
I promised you
a fresh start.
I promised you a place
to start a family.
That was then.
I'm not giving up.
So...you can shut up.
[laughs]
Tonight
is sushi night.
I'm feeling lucky.
 [loud muffled music]
 Ben.
 [loud muffled TV]
Ben.
No answer.
Tom.
Ben?
I'm coming down.
Ben.
Ben?
 Oh, Tom.
 [Anna coughing]
Oh, my God.
 [indistinct police
 radio chatter]
I can't believe
he was down here
the whole time.
 Yeah.
 Right below
 where our bedroom is.
Anna.
What?
 Oh, my God, Tom.
220,000 pounds.
What the hell
was Ben doing
with this much cash?
What was he doing
living in our basement
with all this cash?
Well, he was
on disability,
and maybe he had
a big settlement
after an accident?
I just don't know
why it wouldn't be
in the bank.
So, what do we do?
Hm?
We call the police.
Yeah?
 [doorbell rings]
Anna. Anna.
What?
Wait.
 [doorbell rings]
Tom.
Help me.
We shouldn't have
brought this up here.
I know.
You want to help me?
Tom.
Help me now.
I got it.
Answer the door.
Mr. Wright?
Yes.
I'm Detective Inspector
John Halden.
So, Mr. Wright,
what-what is it you do?
 He's a landscape architect.
Oh.
Yeah.
I used to be,
in Chicago.
I had a small business,
a little crew,
but it fell apart
in the crash,
so we moved here
for a fresh start.
We also had
an unfortunate miscarriage
a few years ago, so--
Oh, I'm so sorry.
So sorry.
 It was a nice
 change for us.
 So, now I-I do
 contracting work
odd jobs
and manual labor.
 Why London?
Tom's renovating
a house.
 My grandmother
 passed a few years ago
and we inherited
the family house,
so I thought I'd fix it up.
Good for you.
So, Mrs. Wright,
how are you, um,
how are you liking London?
Anna, please.
I'm a school teacher
at Morningside Primary
School.
My wife runs a clinic
just down the street
from there.
 Sterling House?
 That's a, uh,
 women's shelter, right?
 Yeah. They look after young
 women with drug addiction,
 take them off the streets.
 The government
 has withdrawn its funding,
but they're hanging in there.
My wife, Marie,
isn't one for giving up.
[laughing]
Anyhow...
So, thank you
for the tea.
 It was very good.
How long have
you been renting
the room downstairs?
Uh, not long.
I mean, we just did it
'cause we needed help
with the rent.
Three months, maybe.
 Yeah.
And he always paid by cash.
Did you find this odd?
No, not really, no.
Did he, um,
did he have
any visitors?
Uh, he really kept to himself.
I mean, he didn't have much.
No.
He watched
a lot of television.
 Yeah, that's true.
 Very loud.
Did, um, did you find
anything unusual about him?
When you, um,
when you discovered
the body, did you--
Did you find
anything else?
Um--
No.
The reason I ask
is because the initial
police report
suggests that he died
of a drug overdose,
and the team downstairs
are just looking
for evidence
that he may
have kept drugs there.
No, we had-- I mean,
we had no idea.
Well, it's just, uh--
it's just routine.
For your own safety.
 [Newscaster]
 ...late 40's
 discovered in the basement
 of a flat.
 The cause of death
 is as yet unknown.
 His identity
 is being withheld
 until relatives are traced.
 To the city now,
 and London's markets
 are still not steady.
 There's a new lead
to-to the guys
that gave Julie
the drugs.
I thought Martin
took you off that case.
 Yeah.
Is it dangerous?
 Really dangerous, then.
 Still not going
 to bring her back, John.
So,
why take the risk?
It might save
someone else's daughter.
We'll call Halden
in the morning.
 [clattering]
Tom?
Tom?
 [pounding]
What are you doing?
[sighs]
 We spent our whole lives
 being good, right?
And what
has it gotten us?
Nothing.
So, maybe this money is a gift
 to help us get our lives
 back on track.
Tom.
We don't know
where this money
comes from.
This could be really,
really bad money.
I know.
I know.
But what makes
money bad?
Not the money.
The people make it bad.
What people do with it.
Now, I'm not saying
we do anything rash.
All I'm saying
is we just wait
and see.
He's been dead a week.
The cops came,
they didn't find anything.
No one's come forward
looking for the money.
Okay?
And if they do,
this will look like
Ben hid it.
I say
we just hide it
and wait a week.
Two weeks.
All right.
End of the month.
And then
nobody comes,
we just find it again.
 [telephone ringing]
Halden, where are
the background checks
on the Scott case?
You wouldn't be wasting time
on the Witkowski case?
I told you to drop it.
 Nobody gives a shit
 if Jack Witkowski killed
 his twat of a brother.
 Another deficient shitsack
 off the street is fine
 with this department.
The Scott background checks,
on my desk by five.
 [door closes]
And this has nothing
to do with Julie?
No, no, no, no.
It's just--
It's just a hunch
I want to follow up on.
If I'm going to break
every law I'm here
to uphold,
I'd rather it was
for a good cause.
Okay.
It has everything
to do with my daughter.
Bank accounts,
Inland Revenue,
utility bills, mortgage.
From now on, if Thomas
or Anna Wright sneeze,
you'll know about it.
But I warn you,
there's not much money
to follow.
No, not at the moment.
Okay.
You'll keep me posted?
If Martin finds out,
I'll be fired.
 Martin's a smug
 little prick.
Superintendent Tosspot
can go fuck himself.
 (Tom)
 Detective Halden?
 Yes.
 Hi, this is
 Tom Wright from the--
 How are you?
 We were just wondering
 if you heard anything
 about the next of kin
 for Ben Tuttle.
 No, no, no.
 We haven't located
 any living relatives.
I just ask
because, uh,
we wanted to know
what do with his things,
his clothes and stuff.
 No, no one's come
 forward, yet.
Okay.
And, uh,
do you know,
was it officially--
Yeah, overdose.
Looks like
it was Liquid O.
 What's Liquid O?
Heroin.
 I see.
 Wow.
 Okay.
 Have a good day.
Bye.
 (Jack)
 You met my little brother,
 haven't you?
Always tried
to let him win.
Any game.
Drove Mom crazy.
Said Bobby
would never learn
if we did that.
'Course she was right.
 Jack and Bobby.
 How it came to this?
Mom was a fan.
 She also had
 high expectations.
Where's Cousin Ben?
You know, when you
recommend a guy,
 you're tying
 his name to yours.
Did you know
he was going
to fuck me?
If you tell me
where I find him,
maybe I'll choose
to believe you on that.
Eddie, sir,
could I please
trouble you for a pen?
You done
the right thing.
 But that doesn't mean
 I'm not going to hold you
 accountable.
[muffled whimper]
Anna.
Yeah.
I spent some
of the money.
What?
 The day we found Ben,
 the landlord gave us
 an eviction notice.
 I was going to tell you,
 but you were in such
 a good mood,
 and it was sushi night.
And then we found
the money, and--
I took just enough
to keep the roof
over our heads.
Look, we're in this.
 As soon as we put the money
 in the oven and we didn't
take it out, we were in this.
If we don't start paying off
the mortgage, we're going
to lose the house.
How do we do this?
We spend just enough
to stop the bleeding.
We use cash
where we can,
and we get Mike
to write an invoice.
You want to bring Mike
into this?
No, it's not like that.
We're not bringing him
into it.
But when I do
a job for him,
he usually pays me cash,
and then writes
an invoice.
So, if anyone asks--
 Right, there's
 a paper trail.
What if someone comes
looking for it, Tom?
Anna.
Nobody's come.
Nobody's going
to come.
And if they do,
who's to say
Ben didn't spend it?
How much
are we talking?
Just enough
to stay above water.
The mortgage,
credit cards.
Just so
we're in the clear.
There's only one problem
that I can think of.
What?
You are going to be
really lonely
when the debt collectors
stop calling.
[laughing]
Hi, this is Anna Wright.
I'm calling to inquire
about an appointment.
Yeah, for an IVF
consultation,
if possible.
Hello.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
 [cell phone ringing]
Halden.
 It's Duncan.
Yeah, what's up?
Not much.
I'm calling
'cause we got a flag.
The Americans?
Yeah.
You were right.
A lot of activity today.
Mr. Wright made
five separate payments.
 I've got deposits
 to the current account,
 mortgage and credit cards.
Cash?
Some cash.
Some money transfers.
 He spread it out.
 No single payment big enough
 to raise flags at the bank.
 [train rolling by]
Fuck.
We found the Liquid O.
What about the cash?
 [door opens]
 [clanking]
 [footsteps]
 (Halden)
 Mr. Wright?
Detective.
It looks like someone
came for Ben's stuff
after all.
Yeah.
Who do you think
would do this?
Your tenant crossed
a very bad man.
That man's name
is Jack Witkowski.
So, who called
the police?
No one.
I just wanted
to talk to you.
Yeah, well, why?
Let's go upstairs.
I'm sorry.
It's not back there.
It's in my car.
But I-I-I did just get
an invoice from, um,
Mike Calloway.
This Mike Calloway,
he's a friend of yours?
He is,
but I do a lot
of work with him,
and he owed me
on two jobs,
and we got paid upfront
for this other thing
last week.
If you're holding
anything back,
you better tell me.
I don't quite understand.
 The dead tenant,
 Ben Tuttle,
 drug abuse,
sudden activity
in your bank account,
 and now, coincidentally,
 a break-in.
 I don't want
 to accuse you
 of anything.
I just want
to clarify things.
 (Anna)
 You're welcome.
 [door opens]
Hey.
Hey.
Ouch.
[whispering]
Sorry, I have
to take this.
 Would you do me a favor
 and please don't mention
 the break-in to my wife?
She's been
a little rattled
since Ben died.
No, really, it's fine.
Tom finally got paid
on that big job I was
telling you about.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that.
Oh, no,
that's too much.
Sarah, I got to go.
Okay, bye.
 So, this Mike Calloway,
 he pays you in cash?
Sorry, what
are you implying?
I'm implying nothing.
I was inquiring
about the deposit,
and your husband cleared it up.
So, all's good.
The worst part
is behind us,
right, baby?
[sighs]
Yeah.
It's all good.
Yo.
Hey.
Bloody hell.
What?
Quality stuff.
Yeah.
I thought you said
you were going to lose
your house.
Mike.
 Yeah.
Can I tell you something?
 [cell phone ringing]
Hang on.
This is Tom Wright.
Sure.
What kind of job?
Okay, I'm interested.
Yeah, I'll come by
with my partner.
Fine, I'll come alone.
Okay.
See you then.
Looks like
we might have
another job.
 (Tom)
 French guy, bought
 a big house in Notting Hill.
Mr. Wright.
 Hi.
Please take a seat.
 Thanks.
You can call me Tom.
You're mister--
You must forgive me.
English is not
my first language.
Okay.
And you,
you're American, yes?
 I am.
I live here now.
And you, you just moved
to the area?
I'm expanding
my empire.
Tell me, Mr. Wright,
are you a team player?
I-I guess.
Do you want to talk
about the renovations,
mister...
Genghis Khan.
Genghis Khan?
Is that what you said?
Do you know this man?
Uh, Genghis Khan, yeah.
I mean,
I've heard of him--
He marched
all over the world.
Countries were so afraid
of this man,
they would lay down
their arms when they heard
of his approach.
Do you know what happened
when they did that?
No, I don't know.
Nothing.
Nothing happened.
The Great Khan
welcomed them into
his kingdom with open arms.
But those
that resisted,
felt his full fury.
He burned the cities,
killed the men,
raped their women,
salted their crops.
Okay.
Um--
I'm sorry, I--
I think I'm probably
not the right guy for this,
so maybe
you should get someone else
for the renovations, okay?
 Recently,
 a group of men
 stole from me.
 Where I come from,
 this would not happen.
But I'm new here, so--
It's not the product
that matters,
it's a question
of honor.
 So now
 I'm burning cities,
I'm salting crops.
And you have housed
my enemy.
 Ben Tuttle.
Oh, I see.
Okay, yes--
Have you heard
of Jack Witkowski?
 This man
 dishonored me.
So, here's
my question for you
and your lovely wife, Anna.
 Are you team players?
What do you mean?
Whose team are you on?
I'm not
on anybody's team.
 If you're not
 on anybody's team,
you are not
on my team.
So, whose team
are you on?
Detective Halden,
it's Tom Wright.
I need your help.
Babe, it's me.
Can you give me--
Where's my money?
 Where's my money?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Me and my brother's money.
Are you an idiot,
you fucking cunt?
And he died
getting it.
So, you can understand me
wanting it back.
Now, where is it?
[whispering]
I don't know.
Please.
Please.
Where's the money?
[chuckles]
[grunting]
[groaning]
So, that's how
you want to play.
 [cell phone ringing]
It's fine with me.
 [echoing]
 I didn't want
 to go this far.
Please...
Please, stop.
Please.
Where's my money?
Please.
 Where's is it?
Please stop.
Where's my money?
[shouting]
Fuck!
Hm.
 [train rolling by]
 [door opens]
Anna.
Anna, no.
Welcome home, Mrs. Tommy.
Tom.
[whispering]
The police are coming.
Just stall.
I'm okay.
 [Anna whispering]
 Oh, my God.
That's enough.
Get up.
Up!
This is what Tommy has.
 Didn't you know?
 When you find
 a pot of gold,
there's always
a monster guarding it.
 You smell so nice.
Just relax.
Stop.
It's downstairs.
Bullshit.
I looked all over.
 It's in the window frame.
I hid it
in the window frame.
Tom's lying.
He's afraid that
if he gives you the money,
you're going to kill us.
Fuck.
Where's the fucking money?
Promise me
you won't kill us.
No.
One, two...
 [doorbell ringing]
Stop pissing about.
Which one?
Three, four, five.
 [doorbell ringing]
This one.
It's this one.
 [car horn honking]
 Oh, fuck!
 [honking]
 (Tom)
 We're in here.
 Downstairs.
 He's downstairs .
 [honking]
 [tires screeching]
 (Halden)
 You're in serious trouble,
 Mr. and Mrs. Wright.
You stole some money
and you spent it,
 so you're going
 to prison.
Do we need
to get a lawyer?
A lawyer
won't change that.
Turning it in won't change it
unless you can turn
all of it in.
No, I didn't think so.
And Jack Witkowski
isn't the kind of guy
to forgive and forget.
He'd find a way to get
to you before we could even
bring you to trial.
I've tried to arrest him
for two years.
He's got ties
to the police.
Someone who turns
a blind eye to what
he does.
There are some people
in Scotland Yard that think
that Jack
is doing us
a service.
He kills his fair share
of bad people.
They believe
that one in the hand
is worth five in the street.
Think they
can...control him.
 (Anna)
 But you don't.
After he's paid off
whichever fucking
corrupt coppers
are protecting him,
he sells his stuff
on the street at cut price.
 He targets
 young women,
 single mums,
people he thinks
he can control.
That's his specialty.
There is a way
out of it.
What?
You help me,
I'll help you.
When Jack
comes after you,
we set a trap.
How?
You say he took
your phone.
Yeah.
When he calls,
you agree to take
the money to him.
You want
to use us as bait?
No.
All right, wait--
No.
Just-- If we-if we do it,
that means we walk.
This doesn't go in the books.
If I took this
to headquarters,
Jack would get wind of it,
I'd be out of a job,
you two would be dead.
Find somewhere safe
for tonight.
 (Anna)
 Tom.
 Tom.
 You know he would've
 killed you, right?
 You told me to stall.
 You told me the police
 were coming.
Before.
Why didn't you
just show him where
the money was?
Why didn't you
tell me somebody
broke into our house.
I just wanted us
to have a little money
so we wouldn't get evicted,
so we could have--
 [pounding on wall]
 Shut up!
So we could have a life.
I went
to the fertility clinic,
 and I spent
 some of the money.
I'm sorry.
I feel so stupid.
 It's okay.
Something
was wrong with me.
I just--
It's okay.
Come here.
Come here.
All we wanted
was a family.
 [telephone ringing]
 (Tom)
 It's him.
Hello?
 (Jack)
 Knock, knock.
 Room service.
 So, where have you put it?
 In the hotel safe
 or under the bed?
 How can you fuck
 on that dirty mattress?
 People like you
 are so predictable, Tommy.
All right,
you can have your money.
Just leave us alone.
 I want to see you
 and the money.
When?
Where?
It needs to be in public
for my safety.
 Tomorrow, noon,
 Victoria Park
 by the pond.
And then you
leave us alone.
 [phone off the hook]
What now?
The, um,
the tracking device
is sewn into the seam.
It's virtually undetectable,
and I can track you
on my phone.
As soon as you see him,
put the bag down
and walk away.
Don't run,
don't look back.
No exceptions,
no heroics,
no nothing.
Just drop and go.
And when we're gone,
you'll arrest him?
Yes, as soon
as he picks up
the bag, it's over,
by which time
you'll be gone
and safe.
You'll be under
constant supervision.
My men will be watching you,
but you won't see them.
All right.
Drop and go.
Okay.
 (Anna)
 He's going
 to get us killed.
 (Tom)
 Not if we have back-up.
 [elevator ding]
 Bonjour.
 Enchantée.
You must be Anna.
I take it Jack Witkowski
paid you a visit.
Yeah.
So, tell me,
Mr. and Mrs. Wright,
what is the plan
you want to speak
to me about?
Where is he?
He'll call us.
 [cell phone ringing]
Where are you?
You're late.
 Tell me, Tommy,
 why are our good friends
 from the Met joining us?
Don't worry about him.
He's not with us.
Just let him walk by
and you can have your money.
 I'm not talking about
 that one, you tosser.
 He works for me.
Wave to the good
people, Marshall.
 I'm talking about that
 mangy fuck, Halden.
 [gunshots]
 [people screaming]
Run.
Drop the bag.
Fuck.
Marshall, you fucking dick,
get the fucking money.
Drop the bag, Tom.
 [gunshots]
Drop the bag.
Drop the bag.
Run.
 Anna, run.
 [tires screeching]
 (Anna)
 Why didn't you
 just drop the money?
 'Cause the money's
 the only thing keeping us
 alive right now.
 Halden is dead.
I know.
They killed him.
I know.
Anna.
 What are we going
 to do, Tom?
 Where are we going to go?
 We have one place
 where we can go.
At least
for a few hours.
 (Khan)
 You broke your word.
 Do you think
 I would let you play me?
 (Tom)
 I'm not trying
 to play you, Khan.
When I find you,
just remember
you brought this
on yourselves.
Would you mind
giving us a minute
in private, Mrs. Halden?
Yeah, I was going
to grab a coffee anyway.
What in God's name
were you thinking?
Not only were you wearing
a bulletproof vest,
but you took a firearm
into a public park.
There are children there,
for Christ's sake.
You're an embarrassment.
You should've retired
when your junkie daughter
died.
 [Nurse]
 Excuse me, sir.
 Mr. Halden needs to rest.
 Okay, my apologies.
You rest up, John.
Good news for me is
now I don't have
to pay your pension.
 Who's going to pay
 your pension, Ray?
Scotland Yard or guys
like Jack Witkowski?
I wanted to fix the floor
before I showed it to you.
It's a little
different upstairs.
You want to see?
Yeah.
Remember when we started
working on the house
and we'd eat
take-away on the floor?
Yeah.
Remember when I thought
I'd be done in four months?
Remember when I thought
I'd be pregnant in six?
I'm sorry
I stopped
coming here.
I'm sorry I got lost
in this place.
I never needed
the house, Tom.
 All I needed was us.
 I know.
(Anna)
We're going to make it.
Tell me we're
going to make it.
 [footsteps]
[crying]
 It's okay, Boo-boo.
 I'm coming.
 Give me your phone.
Give me your phone.
 [cell phone ringing]
Sarah?
 (Jack)
 You smell so lovely.
Julian's a real peach.
Hello?
 You want kids,
 don't you, Tommy?
 Me, too.
Such a precious gift.
So, hurting
little Julian
it's not going
to be easy for me.
[crying]
He's so smooth.
 What's your plan, Tommy?
What's your plan, Tommy?
 We can't go out.
 After the park, the police
 are looking for us, too.
We're hiding out
in an old house
in West London.
 I'll text you
 the address
 and you come
 meet us here.
Okay?
No more tricks.
Keep fucking quiet.
[tires screeching]
Better text Khan.
Yeah.
You really think
he's going to come?
 Yeah.
It's all about honor
with that guy.
Sent.
You know they're going
to have guns, right?
Guns are for pussies.
[beeping]
 [cell phone ringing]
Yeah.
(Jack)
Look who's come
for dinner.
Anna?
Get ready.
This is the perfect place.
For what?
 I see no cash.
It's in the house.
Safe.
Don't fuck with me.
 Jack, you can have
 the money
just as soon
as we get Sarah
and Julian.
 Where's Mrs. Tommy?
She's inside,
with the money.
What the fuck.
Honey, I'm home.
Mrs. Tommy.
[cocks gun]
 You got five seconds
 to show me the money
or I'm shooting your husband.
 (Anna)
 The money's up here.
How can I be sure?
 I just want Sarah,
 I want Julian,
 but if you hurt them
 or my husband,
 I will destroy
 all of it.
That's impressive.
I'll get them over.
[whistles]
 Get the fuck out, love.
Now it's your turn.
Well done, sweetheart.
Now the bag.
Jack?
Are you all right?
[weak chuckle]
 [nailing]
Sarah!
 (Anna)
 Sarah!
 [gunshots]
Go out the ladder.
 [whispering]
 Sarah, go out
 the ladder.
[muffled grunt]
Oh, God.
Give me Julian.
Give me Julian
[chuckles]
[grunts]
 [Julian crying]
 [jet flies by]
[beeping]
 [jet flies by]
 [Sarah screams]
 [boards creak]
Andre?
 [boards creak]
 (Khan)
 You betrayed me,
 Mr. Wright.
 You cannot undo that.
You must be sacrificed
 pour le bien de tous.
 [nail gun fires]
 The greater good.
[gunshots]
Does not seem fair.
You are playing with toys
while I am not playing
at all.
You are a worthy
adversary.
 [gunshot]
Ahh!
Anna.
 Anna.
[gasping]
 Anna.
 [gunshot]
 [lady newscaster]
 Metro Police today
 announced a breakthrough
 in a case that's traumatized
 people living in the sleepy
 London suburb of Mortlake.
 It comes just 36 hours
 after a shootout which left
 five people dead
 a house burnt to the ground,
 and the entire community
 in shock.
 With me is Superintendent
 Ray Martin,
 one of the officers
 in charge of the case.
 Superintendent,
 what can you tell us?
 We can now confirm
 that these tragic events
 are directly linked
 to a drug turf war
 which began with an armed
 robbery that turned deadly
 in an East End night club .
 (Halden)
 Remarkable.
Hi.
 ...and extraordinary bravery
 of veteran detective
 John Halden
 a man I consider to be
 a personal friend
 and a colleague.
It's easy to be a hero
when you're writing
your own story.
Uh, the firemen
found this.
It's, um--
It's not much,
but, uh, it's yours.
Good luck.
 [muffled voices]
Hm.
(Tom)
What took you so long?
I just had to do
one last thing.
All right.
Say goodbye
to this hell hole.
Come on.
So, no more
sushi nights.
