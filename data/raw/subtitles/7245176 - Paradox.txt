Get up!
Get up!
Shooting your video so early?
Come on!
Smile for the camera.
Or I'll tickle you.
I'll bite you!
Bite you!
I won't take you out for breakfast.
I'll just eat you, OK?
Come on! Smile!
Hurry up!
Say good morning.
Good morning.
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday, happy birthday!
Happy birthday to you!
Wing-chi!
Happy birthday!
Thanks!
Open it.
Hello, Uncle!
This is Henry.
Classmate?
We met at a coffee shop.
Where do you go to school?
I'm studying on my own.
Working part time at a coffee shop.
Fine!
If you go out at night,
just let me know.
Let's order.
No!
We want to get married.
Maybe you think I'm not a good student.
I look too young
and unreliable.
But I'll take good care of Chi.
I'm serious about her.
I'm sorry!
I want the baby.
Honey!
See? It's moving!
As if It's saying hello.
Did you pick out a name?
Not yet!
I picked a few.
Take a look.
It's OK if you don't like them.
Thanks, Dad!
Soei,
it's been too long since
you sang your Mom's favorite song for me.
Again?
This is an order!
Yes, Sir!
"You ask me how deep is my love"
"how much I love you"
"I love you with all my heart"
"The moon represents my heart"
Yes.
Uncle, this is Jenny.
Chi came to see me in Thailand,
but she has been missing these past few days.
I'm worried something happened to her.
Uncle!
I couldn't find Chi.
Inspector Chui!
What's up?
A girl from Hong Kong arrived 6 days ago.
She lost contact 3 days ago.
Her friend called her
father and he reported it.
Did you check the hospital?
Yes.
No record of any girl from
Hong Kong checking in.
She came to visit her friend Jenny,
who's also from Hong Kong
and has a working visa.
She's a tattooist at her boyfriend's shop.
She's been missing for 3 days.
Anything else?
Where's the father?
Inside.
I did that.
No sign of the room being searched.
Nothing missing.
No suicide note.
I'm also a cop.
Hello, I'm Chui Kit.
Pattaya Police.
Don't worry, we'll do our best.
Ban!
Take the CCTV back to the precinct.
Yes, Sir!
Other than you and Jenny,
does anyone else know she's here?
No.
Not even your wife?
She passed away.
I'm sorry!
What was she doing in Thailand?
Visiting her friend Jenny.
What was she doing here?
She was unhappy in Hong Kong.
She called me up
and asked if she could visit me.
Did you notice
if your daughter had any emotional problems?
I don't think so.
I don't think she's having problems.
Didn't go anywhere?
What was she doing at your shop?
She wanted a tattoo.
Does she have a boyfriend?
Yes, but...
Inspector Lee!
Are you Henry?
You're suspected of having sexual intercourse
with an underage girl.
You need to come in for questioning.
Move!
Move it!
No...
No...
No...
No...
I heard you had her boyfriend arrested.
How is that related to her disappearance?
I was wondering
if she was trying to avoid you.
I did what all fathers would have done.
Sign here!
How would you proceed?
What do you mean?
I don't want to wait around.
I want to tag along.
That depends...
Sign here and wait outside.
Move it!
Take him into custody.
You have a lot of nerve hitting a cop!
Thanks.
Chui Kit!
He's yours?
Yes.
What kind of case?
His daughter is missing.
Where is he from?
Hong Kong.
Why?
Nothing.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Don't tell me.
It's definitely a girl.
Great!
You may go.
Uncle!
What does this word mean?
It's Spanish.
It means goodbye.
What was your Dad's reaction
to your first tattoo?
I didn't care.
I told myself,
the right side of my body is theirs.
The left side is mine.
Are you sure?
There's no turning back.
Half the body is mine. Come on...
Thanks.
We're gathered here today
because we believe
hope will bring power.
We believe in ourselves.
Emphasize ourselves,
not we.
We believe in ourselves.
We have the power to make society better.
Today's victory belongs to you.
Re-elect Mayor Aziz.
Move the light on the left.
The Mayor fainted.
Dr. Ko,
it's the Mayor. We're coming over now.
Breathe...
Relax!
Did he take his pills?
Yes.
Ano!
Yes?
Seal off the staff entrance.
Right!
What about the reporters in the lobby?
Cancel it.
Yes!
Cancel the press conference.
Excuse me... listen, everyone!
There's been a problem with the alarm.
We had to cancel the press conference.
We're very sorry.
Primary cardiomyopathy.
He's likely to suffer a heart failure.
What can we do?
Heart transplant.
The Mayor needs a heart transplant.
We'll definitely win the re-election.
Rest assured.
Thank you, General!
We found nothing in the hotel.
But based on the signal
of your daughter's phone,
this is her last location.
Welcome!
Police!
We need to see your CCTV.
Please come this way.
Police!
We need to see your CCTV.
Sure!
Have you seen her?
No!
She's cute.
Ouch...
Sorry!
You seen this girl?
No.
Sorry!
You seen this girl?
Chinese?
Have you seen her?
I'm good too.
You should consider me.
Have you seen her?
No.
No.
Don't worry!
Go to bed. I'll be home soon.
Come here!
Let me rewind this...
Wait here. I'll go check it out.
Beer.
OK!
Stop it!
What the hell?
Why were you following her?
I don't know what you mean.
You want to play tough?
I really don't know.
He checked out.
When your daughter went missing,
he was out of the country.
Then why did he follow her?
Stop it!
Chill out!
Don't move!
You look awful.
No kidding!
Watch out!
That guy from Hong Kong brings bad luck.
Another premonition?
Give me your hand.
What?
Don't take it off. Wear it every day.
Thank you, Master!
God put them on this earth for us to consume.
It's against nature for us not to eat them.
I always tell my clients
not to think so much.
If it wasn't meant to be,
God would not have made it possible.
You know what I mean?
You know you can trust me.
You agree with the price?
Just give me what I want.
Of course!
Any preferences?
Young and durable.
OK!
You know...
you didn't have to come here by yourself.
I'm trying to be your friend.
Can I have this?
As a gift?
Sure!
Consider it yours.
Drink?
Suit yourself.
I'm talking to you.
Get in.
What? Am I that cheap?
OK!
Have you seen this girl?
No!
Thanks!
What's your name?
Lee Wing-chi.
You know what kind of operation this is?
Abortion.
OK! Just relax.
We'll put you under now.
Hello?
OK!
I'll be right there.
Mr. Lee,
we found a body by the sea.
We need you to take a look.
You can't go in!
Where's the body?
Inspector!
I beg you all...
This is my daughter.
She has been missing for 6 days.
If anyone knows her whereabouts,
contact the Police.
I beg you all...
Please!
Please help me.
Don't worry!
We'll find her.
Try this.
Take 2 before you go to sleep.
See if it helps.
Thank you.
What is it?
I'm bleeding.
Don't worry, Honey!
Call 191. My wife is in trouble.
Thanks.
Honey!
How do you feel?
You feel dizzy?
No!
Wait a minute.
My 6-month pregnant wife is bleeding at home.
South Pattaya Road, Soi 5. Send someone over!
Thanks!
Honey!
I called for help.
They're coming.
I'm on my way over.
Do your breathing.
Take a deep breath.
Kids are naughty.
Just like me.
Let me talk to him.
Baby, this is Daddy.
You must take care of Mummy.
Don't be naughty.
Daddy will sing for you.
"You ask me how deep is my love"
"how much Daddy loves you"
"I love you with all my heart"
"The moon represents my heart"
The moon is for sale. The sun is not.
Mommy is for sale, but Daddy is not.
Mommy is for sale?
Why?
What kind of supermarket is that?
Go easy on Daddy. He's tired.
Do they sell apples?
No.
Strawberries?
No.
Tell Daddy the answer. He doesn't know.
Watch out!
Where's Mommy?
Don't worry, the baby is fine.
The bleeding is from a ruptured polyp
in the uterus.
She's fine after we stop the bleeding.
That's wonderful! Thank you!
See? Told you.
Don't cry.
That's great!
The Mayor often talks about you.
How is he?
What have you heard?
Criticisms from a publishing house.
Nothing to worry about.
He's waiting for a transplant.
Why are you telling me this?
Because you're our friend.
Inland Revenue is onto you.
We took care of it.
What do you want from me?
The Hong Kong father and
his missing daughter...
Tell your son-in-law to take it easy.
You'll soon be a Grandpa.
You'd want everyone to be safe.
A girl from Hong Kong went missing
in Pattaya for days.
Her father arrived in Thailand
and sought help from the Pattaya Police.
This afternoon, the father
pleaded to the media
asking for any leads from
the citizens of Pattaya.
The Police provided the following website
for anyone to upload any footages
from CCTV or dashboard cameras.
Can you pay me upfront?
Don't move!
Don't move!
Have you seen this girl?
No.
Have you seen this girl?
No.
I saw your daughter.
How much is she worth?
I really saw her.
I'm talking to you.
Solicit someone else.
Tell me.
I may need money,
but it doesn't mean I'm lying.
I don't want your daughter to end up like me.
I saw that bastard cop snatch her.
Really?
Can I hitch a ride with you?
Sure! Hop in.
Where to?
Here.
What's out there?
Looking for a friend.
Here we are.
Someone told me
my daughter was taken right here.
Did you tell Inspector Chui?
What?
Are you OK?
What? Just spit it out.
What do you want?
Who told you?
Get out!
Why does it say Footage not found?
Maybe it's an upload problem.
Or someone in the precinct deleted it.
Find out who uploaded it.
It won't take long to find the IP address.
Hurry!
OK!
Another left.
OK!
Thanks.
You want me to sell you?
Can I help you?
Where's the footage you
uploaded for the Police?
Get it. Hurry up!
Anyone home?
Help!
Don't let him get away!
Help me!
Hurry!
Help me!
Come on!
Don't hurt the kid!
Help!
Motherfuck!
Brother!
Get it done ASAP.
Don't take it off. Wear it every day.
We'll operate tonight. Don't worry.
Thank you.
I got what you want.
We'll operate tonight.
Right!
You have kids?
Family?
I beg you...
I beg you...
She's all I have.
She's really all I have left.
You'll get me killed.
You'll get me killed.
You made me do it.
Cottage...
Cottage...
Step aside!
Out of the way, please!
They do organ trafficking.
My job is to take her to the cottage.
How much longer?
Stop! Stay where you are.
Calling Control!
A silver Volkswagen going south,
is carrying a seriously injured passenger.
Send backup.
Don't move!
Raise your hands!
Hands up!
Don't move!
Or I'll shoot!
Kit!
Sir!
How's Tak?
We have done our best.
He had severe cerebral hemorrhaging.
He passed away.
My condolences.
Sir!
We were in pursuit
of a hit and run vehicle.
We found Ban inside, unconscious.
The suspect is the guy from Hong Kong.
Inspector!
We found a phone in the car.
Inspetor, Ban deleted the file.
Is he awake?
Not yet.
While in pursuit of a hit and run vehicle,
the Police found a wounded officer inside.
The Chinese national now wanted by the Police
is the father of the missing girl.
Anyone who knows the
whereabouts of the suspect
should contact the Police at once.
You speak Thai?
Hello?
Hello, I need a kidney.
Try this...
Hello?
I need a kidney.
Are you mad?
Try this one.
I need a kidney.
Who's your referral?
Ban.
I have his number.
I know this guy. He's a client.
Maybe she's with him.
Is that him?
You didn't take any rest?
Ban works for the organ trafficking cartel.
I must wait till he wakes up.
You must eat.
You have a date with Soei tonight.
Have you forgotten?
Did you pick out a name?
Not yet!
I picked a few. Take a look.
It's OK if you don't like them.
Thanks, Dad!
Soei,
it's been too long since
you sang your Mom's favorite song for me.
Again?
This is an order!
I knew you'd say that.
Yes, Sir!
"You ask me how deep is my love"
"how much I love you"
"I love you with all my heart"
"The moon represents my heart"
Hello?
Ban is dead!
Sit down!
I told you to sit.
Kit,
listen to me... stop the investigation.
Why?
Pretend it never happened.
A life is at stake.
I will get to the bottom of this case.
There is no case.
They needed the girl's heart
to save Mayor Aziz.
It'll be in the news tomorrow.
That guy from Hong Kong killed Ban.
Tak's death was an accident.
To them,
the truth is whatever they want it to be.
If necessary,
they can make anyone disappear.
Including you and me.
Look!
Who cares if these people are dead?
Our target is... Sacha,
ex-mercenary.
Over the last few years,
he ran an illegal organ trafficking outfit
targeted at tourists,
under the cover of a frozen meat company.
Put Chui Kit in charge of the operation.
Don't drag him into this.
I thought he's one of us.
According to our informer,
there are 30 to 50 thugs inside,
probably heavily armed.
Shoot to kill.
Chui Kit will be your OC, understand?
Yes, Sir!
I don't want to see that guy from Hong Kong.
Alpha Team ready.
Beta Team ready.
We move out in 30 seconds.
Stop!
Why?
Carry on!
The guy from Hong Kong just went inside.
Take him out as well.
Just do as I say. Carry on!
What are you doing here?
Sorry, where is the toilet?
Get out!
Stop!
Way to go, Papa!
You've come a long way.
You're here for a kidney?
Where's my daughter?
Let's play a game.
If you can find me, I'll take you to her.
Turn around. Up on the right.
Go get him!
Copy that!
Where are you?
Wow! You're really like a wild boar.
Go carve that pig in two.
Where's my daughter?
What are you doing?
This is Commissioner Chai.
I'll take over for Inspector Chui.
Are you ready?
Is it necessary to kill him?
Yes!
Gotcha!
Come here!
Action!
They're here to destroy all the evidence
including you.
They took your daughter's heart
to save the Mayor.
No way!
Go away!
It was my fault!
I'm sorry!
We're cops!
Take me to him.
I can save your wife.
I can't believe
you'd pick my granddaughter's birthday.
We must catch up.
We lost one percentage point at the polls.
The propaganda video will come in handy.
You need to rest.
Happy birthday, Ka-ka!
Blow out the candles with Grandpa, OK?
Smile.
He had nothing to do with it.
Take it up with me.
To you,
other people's lives
are worthless.
People die in natural disasters.
How much are they worth?
Heaven is indifferent.
Your daughter showed up at the wrong place.
When I'm gone,
will Chui Kit and his family be off the hook?
Lee Wing-chi.
I'm so disappointed in you.
How did it come to this?
Maybe you were right.
Or maybe I made a mistake.
Right or wrong,
how can you tell?
Who gets to decide
whose life is more important?
People...
can only see what's in front of them.
No matter how far away you go,
how wide the sky is,
you're still narrow minded.
The bracelet is pretty.
Congratulations! You have a baby.
"You ask me how deep is my love"
"how much Daddy loves you"
"I love you with all my heart"
"The moon represents my heart"
