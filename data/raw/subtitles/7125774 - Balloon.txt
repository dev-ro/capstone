BETWEEN 1976 AND 1988, THERE WERE
APPROXIMATELY 38,000 ESCAPE ATTEMPTS
BY EAST GERMAN CITIZENS
FLEEING TO THE WEST.
AT LEAST 462 MEN, WOMEN,
AND CHILDREN WERE KILLED
AT THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC'S BORDER.
TO THE GDR REGIME,
THEY WERE TRAITORS TO THEIR COUNTRY.
BASED ON A TRUE STORY.

- That's your son.
- Yes, and he's having fun, too.
Thank you, children. Thank you.
- Can you sing along next time?
- Watch out.
- I can make a new son.
- Maybe he'll laugh at your jokes.
As Goethe said:
"Every day, one should
listen to one little song..."
"read one good poem..."
"see one fine painting..."
"and... if possible...
speak a few reasonable words."
More briefly, we can cite Comrade Lenin:
"Learn, learn, and keep learning."
Today, you become accepted
into the community of adults.
- With all those rights...
- Immediately he lifts his finger.
...but also with responsibilities!
Society will demand more from you.
As you always relied upon us,
we will now rely upon you.
Whether with the hammer, the stethoscope,
the sickle, or the firearm in the hand.
For peace and socialism.
This little blue book
is of great value.
It's not just so you
order beer in any pub.
From now on, you are
also responsible for your actions.
And be sure that
we will not let you out of our sight.
- I'm so relieved.
- Shh...
I now ask the 8th grade
to rise for the socialist
pledge of allegiance.
"Are you ready..."
"as a young citizen of
the German Democratic Republic..."
"for the great and noble cause
of socialism..."
"to fight and work ..."
"and protect the revolutionary achievements
of the people?"
Yes, we swear.
The Soviet Union...
That was a nice speech from Meissner.
He always does that well.
And well sung.
Oh, we are so lucky with the weather!
The prospects...
Oh! Listen, Beate!
Uh-huh!
So, when are you leaving?
- What?
- Well, it's almost the holidays!
- Oh, uh...
- We drive abroad.
Bulgaria, the Black Sea.
The best.
- Haven't you booked yours yet?
- It's not that easy.
So, now I'm getting angry.
You could have come over and said:
"Erik, I want a trip."
And I would ask, "Where to?"
And you would say...? Yes, say something!
Well, come on,
where do you want to go?
Well, I don't know.
Come on, say something really difficult.
"Berlin, capital of
the German Democratic Republic."
- What are you saying?
- Well, Berlin would be nice.
There, you see?
A call to my comrades at the travel
agency, and... Bang!...
The Strelzyk family is
in the Berlin City Hotel.
And not on the tour group floor.
At the top.
Up there, you can see West Berlin.
Right, Beate?
Yes.
I always have my binoculars with me.

These are my balloons!
Give it to me!
In the name of the State Security Service,
I thank you for the lift.
- I could not have driven anymore.
- No problem, Mr. Baumann.
- Oh boy, look, the drummers.
- Hello.
- Do you have any plans?
- Yes.
- Maybe another time.
- From now on, call me Erik.
What a beautiful gift.
- A beautiful couple.
- I like your new watch, as well.
Papa, look! They fly to the West!
So, that is called an airspace violation!
But don't worry.
It's only balloons!
The wind has turned.
We have to go to Günter right away.
Fitscher, we'll be right back.
- Are you still coming with us?
- Yes! Come over with me!
- A wonderful idea.
- Today is for celebrating.
- Yeah, it's just that...
- Don't be a spoilsport, Peter.
- Not on a day like today.
- Where are you going?
We have to go to the train station.
My mother-in-law is visiting.
- Maybe later.
- I take you at your word.
- Have you already seen my new watch?
- It has a stopwatch!
I want to get one for
my Jugendweihe, too.
On your marks, get ready, get set, go!
It's too risky.
What?
Günter, are you kidding me?
It's not going to work.
Wait, Günter,
you planned this thing.
This was your idea!
The balloon is ready in our basement!
I recalculated it.
It is too dangerous.
Guys, come on! For weeks
we've waited for the right wind!
The balloon is just not large enough.
It is too small for eight people.
This is just unreal.
And your sick mother...
You wanted to go over to her.
I know,
but the kids are still so small.
If something happens to them...
We cannot risk that.
Believe me, Peter,
this thing will not carry us all.
So, what now?
We are staying here.
What about four people?
- Yes. Four could go.
- Oh God...
What will become of you then?
- We are back!
- Günter, we will have to break contact.
Otherwise, you will get in trouble.
No calls, no letters.
- Father!
- Well, Peter? How was it?
We let the kites fly!
- Oh, hello. You have visitors?
- Good day.
- These are friends. Doris, Peter.
- I am the "bad stepfather."
- We were just leaving.
- Oh, the commotion he always causes.
- I made sauerbraten.
- The best in the world.
Thanks, but we really have to go...
Jugendweihe, and so on.
Petra.
Good luck.
- "Go to jail."
- Ha!
Hey, it's only a game.
- And? Is it on?
- Frank!
- Is what on?
- Please, go to your room.
- What is...?
- We have to talk to Frank.
- But why...?
- Fitscher, upstairs.
Man!
Then I will not tell you anything any more.
What is it, now?
They aren't coming.
What? Why?
We're going alone. Tonight.
Really? Without Günter?
At six, we'll listen to the weather report.
I'll drive up and check the wind.
Until then, we'll pack.
Then I'll get changed, ok?
We're doing the right thing.
Promise me that nothing
will happen to the children.
Trust me.
I'm sorry about earlier.
But it should be a surprise.
- We're going camping tonight.
- Really?
- Where?
- In the forest.
- I'll get Fitscher.
- Good.
- Can I take my bike?
- You can't ride in the forest at night.
But I could ride my BMX
full-speed over the roots!
What are you doing here?
Oh... cleaning.
Doris, we will not be coming back.
As a kid, when I was at summer camp,
I cried into my pillow every night.
I had such incredible homesickness.
The others got over it in a couple days,
but, for me, it only stopped
when I was home again.
Where were you?
We had to clean up a little.
Nobody will call me
a bad housewife.
Keep driving.
Son of a bitch!
Shit.
Our forces...
are all provocations
of the class enemy...
- Paul's son was drafted.
- Maybe you'll forget, Günter?
- I'm not so lucky.
- Werner forgot, too.
Ingrid, he forgot
and then they picked him up.
- Who picked him up?
- The military police.
Early in the morning, at six,
they hammered at his door.
- Told your sister.
- I didn't notice.
If you have an important job,
you may not be drafted.
I'm an ambulance driver.
All because they didn't
let him study physics.
He was five,
when his father went over.
- Mama!
- I'll go.
- Mom!
- Yes!
I'm coming.
It is an honor for the
pilots to demonstrate
to the party leadership
the combat and maneuver
characteristics of their airplanes.
Your mother is worried about you.
- Me too.
- You needn't be.
Your mother will have
the most pleased smile...
if you are okay.
But, you have an obligation
to make sure that you yourself are happy.
There is nothing
the people who love you want more.
Are you happy?
Of course I am happy.
I have my house,
a small garden,
I have your mother,
I have you.
I do not need anything more.
But you do not have to
want the same thing.
You have your whole life ahead of you.
Not a word to your mother.
I have never heard you
speak like this before.
It doesn't happen that often.
- What are we doing?
- That's the surprise.
- I thought we were going camping.
- This is much better.
With this, we will fly to the West.
And what if soldiers shoot at us?
- Over there, you'll get your BMX bike.
- Really?
Promise.
- Let's go.
- Get on.
Hold on to the ropes well.
Do not let go, understand?
Looks good!
- Ready?
- Yes.
One, two, three!
- Mommy, I want to get out.
- It's okay. It going to be fun.
One, two, three!
Frank, are you marking the time?
Everyone okay?
- Almost 300 meters.
- We are so brightly lit up.
They can see us for kilometers.
Yes, we have to go higher.
Through the clouds.
- I'm cold.
- Come here.
How high up are we now?
- 1700 meters.
- And the flight time?
14 minutes.
Then we're about half-way there.
Let me know if we start to descend.
Mom, I'm scared.
When I was your age,
I lay down on a meadow
and looked at the clouds in the sky.
Once, there was a cloud
that looked like
a huge, jumping horse.
I wished that it would carry
me whereever I wanted to go.
And look where we are now.
In the middle of a cloud.
There's another saying:
that dreams do come true.
Something is dripping.
That's the high humidity,
coming off of the cloud.
Is this material waterproof?
When it absorbs all that water,
won't we get pretty heavy?
How is the altitude now?
1700 meters.
Not higher?
It's hard to say.
Shit. We're falling!
800. 700!
We're coming down too fast!
There's the border!
Are we past it?
600!
Damn! Shit!
- That's it.
- The fuel line is frozen.
- What are you doing?
- We have to thaw it.
Matches, quick!
Father, are we going to die now?
- Hurry up!
- Once more!
Once more! Do it again!
It's not working.
Everyone OK?
Frank? Doris?
- All good.
- Yes?
- Did you get hurt?
- No.
Come here. Come here.
Come.
It's over.
- It's over... Shhh...
- Where are we?
How long were we in the air?
32 minutes. Was that enough?
Almost.
Only a few meters more
and we would have made it.
But now?
- What if they find us?
- Let's get out, quickly.
Back to the starting point.
It's at least ten kilometers away.
There could be alarm trip wires anywhere.
We have to wait until it gets light.
RESTRICTED AREA
UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY OR PHOTOGRAPHY
IS FORBIDDEN VIOLATORS WILL BE FINED
A tow truck.
They've discovered our car.
We have to get rid of this stuff.
What a disaster.
What craziness.
- Luckily, nothing worse happened!
- We have to keep our nerve.
- We must go on as before.
- We're done!
- But we were almost made it!
- It's over, Peter!
That's it!
We go back to "normal" life.
You go to school tomorrow.
We go to work.
Don't reveal anything.
At some point, grass will grow over this.
So I don't get a BMX bike?
I trust we are not disturbing anyone?
We wanted to ask if your home
would hang decorations
for the 30th anniversary of the Republic?
Do you have a flag?
If not, no problem.
You can get one from us.
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel,
Lieutenant Strehle.
- This is your border section?
- Yes!
You wake up in the morning to such a mess?
I wish I could sleep as soundly as you.
- Solid construction.
- Mm.
How long has it been here?
Not long.
The grass under the platform is fresh.
Tonight, I suppose.
These tablets were lying
next to the gondola.
To the medical department.
The rest,
to forensic investigation.
- The whole balloon?
- All of it.
And the entire circumference
of 500 meters.
I want every shred documented.
- If necessary, also the bunny shit.
- Yes, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel!
One company for canvassing the area.
- Can we trace the gas containers back?
- No.
The production numbers have been removed.
They were not stupid.
What an effort.
200 meters further
and they would've made it over.
This will become
a pain in my ass.
Why don't we just let them leave,
just let them run?
If they think they will
be so happy over there?
Don't you ask yourself that,
Comrade Lieutenant?
Honestly, no,
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.
Yes, you can ask yourself this,
don't you think?
"Every illegal border crossing
will be prevented."
Yes, I know the order.
But what did we do to these people,
that inspires such robust criminality?
We simply want justice...
Humanity... A better world...
We should be happy
when the enemies of socialism flee.
When we are rid of that rabble, right?
- Is that a serious question, now?
- Yes.
Surely, you have an opinion.
Tell me your opinion.
Don't you understand?
Not all that well, I see.
Where would we be without this border?
It makes us what we are.
Those who challenge it,
challenge us.
You and me.
Let us hope that one of
your sentries saw what happened.
Because I take this sort of thing
very personally.
Me too, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.
Good.
They could have started from anywhere.
- At every little glade.
- It goes on like this.
200 kilometers
to the Czech border.
Who would have thought that we
have so much beautiful forest?
Hmm?
Just wanted to see
if everything was alright.
Is everything ok?
Yes. Everything's fine.
- Why?
- Well...
You didn't come over yesterday.
So I thought...
Something had happened
with your mother-in-law.
Where is she?
Well... she was not feeling well.
She fell at the station.
We had to drive her to the Polyclinic,
to Gera.
We sat there for hours.
- Ah, that wasn't part of the plan.
- No.
What's with your hands?
Slipped.
Sometimes everything goes wrong at once.
Now, I have to ask you a question.
You're such a hobbyist.
- I would call myself an electrician.
- Exactly.
We have a new TV.
Color. Good picture.
But for some stations,
the reception, for some reason,
is not very good.
You want to see Western programs?
Can you do anything about it?
We'd really like to watch
"Charlie's Angels"...
Yeah, you just need a PAL converter
attached to the antenna.
And "Charlie's Angels" will be very sharp.
Could you come over perhaps?
Sure, of course.
Excellent.
One really shouldn't lie, right?
Sure. Lying is shitty.
Then, why are you all lying
to me, all the time?
What are you talking about?
Yes, you never tell me the truth.
Look, Fitscher...
It's just that the truth...
is sometimes... complicated.
The truth is,
that we cannot talk about this here.
Here, in our country.
- You know, there are rights...
- I don't mean that.
What about Czechoslovakia
or Hungary?
Other people have done it.
We cannot put four people
in the trunk.
What about the West
German representative?
That is guarded more closely
than the US Embassy.
Then, we try the Embassy.
The Americans are accepting
politically persecuted people.
To do it, we would have
to contact them.
An old mother
addresses a People's Policeman:
I'm looking for the
department store principle.
Principle?
There's no 'principle' here.
"Yes!" says the mother.
State Council Chairman Honecker
has said:
"In principle, you can buy anything."
If you said the wrong thing,
it could be very dangerous.
But I am telling you,
because I trust you.
And you can trust us.
We did not tell you everything
because we wanted to protect you.
Do you understand this?
Is everything ok?
My medicine.
What about it?
I had the...
...the bag with my thyroid medicine...
I must have lost it in the woods.
Was your name on it?
No, but they're numbered.
They can trace it back.
They will check every prescription.
We left our fingerprints
on the gondola.
We should not have done that.
What kind of parents are we?
Doris, we are not bad parents.
We were just had bad luck!
Bad luck? Bad luck?
- It was irresponsible!
- It is irresponsible to stay here.
- The boys should grow up in freedom!
- We almost killed the boys!
- We had a dream!
- I trusted you!
- Our dream!
- Do you know what I dream?
For weeks, almost every night?
That they take our children away!
My brother went to the
Penitentiary at 14.
When he returned,
he had no teeth!
It's exactly because of that shit
that we need to get away!
What do you think they will do to us?
They will make us disappear.
Fitscher placed in another home.
I don't want to lose our kids.
I don't want to go to another home.
Come here, my sparrow.
You don't have to be scared.
We'll take care of you.
Don't worry.
Nobody is coming to our home.
We pull through this.
- Morning, Doris.
- Morning.
Everything OK?
The kids are a bit sick.
- I have not been feeling well, either.
- Oh, you poor thing.
Mokkaböhnchen?
You can remain seated.
It's much better here, right?
We don't always have to
use an interrogation room.
Congratulations:
You are soon to finish your enlistment.
Thank you, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.
You want to go back to school?
Then, something like this happens,
shortly before your release...
Just so that I understand correctly:
You called your supervisor
and needed binoculars.
Exactly. I saw something in the sky.
Uh-huh.
Why did you not have
your own binoculars?
- Well...
- Yes, these things happen.
Never mind.
And you?
Why did you not alert anyone?
Off-duty?
End of the working day?
Your mind is already on the new girlfriend?
Maybe you would not know it to look at me
But I was once a swimmer
During my studies I knew a lifeguard
There was this fellow...
tanned, good looking
such a very relaxed guy.
And one day,
he was a bit too relaxed.
What do you tell the parents
when their eight-year-old drowns?
"I was tired"?
I marked the passage. Read it.
"It is your duty"
"To use your fighting skills"
"such that you will stop, or kill,
the border violator"
"to thwart any border violation attempt."
"Perform your duties
rigorously and carefully"
"because these traitors can prove
to be highly dangerous."
"Do not hesitate to use your firearm,"
"not even when women and children
are in the party,"
"since the traitors often
use these to take advantage of you."
You know your duties.
We know how to look into cases
of frontier trespassing.
We are not stupid.
No, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.
Nevertheless, we have this message...
that was ignored by Private Klenner.
...because he knew about
the planned border breakthrough?
No, I had no idea.
Or was he just lazy?
- Well...
- If you were helping them, admit it now.
- We'll find out anyway.
- No.
- Why, I have...
- Get out.
You could never be officers.
Don't you see, comrades?
This is exactly what I mean.
Take them away.
"Europe internally"
is the keyword...
There! There she is!
She has red hair!
The brunette looked black and white.
- Yes! Everything is so colorful.
- Yes, no?
If you can manage it, come by
and we'll watch "Charlie's Angels."
You're alright, Peter!
Oh, Erik? I almost forgot.
You have talked about comrades
in the travel agency...
Is the offer still valid?
Where do you want to go?
The seams were
made with professional machines.
We've identified all farms
with any such machines.
Our comrades have calculated
that the balloon was in the air
no longer than 40 minutes,
due to wind conditions.
Did they have to start in that area?
The whole area was searched?
Well, it's huge.
There are about 100 glades...
- What else?
- The truck that was seen, at night.
- Where could it have driven?
- Start the search.
- And the fabric stores?
- We got the list today.
Perhaps we could hear
the medical report.
According to the
medical division,
she is a woman between 30 and 40 years
old, possibly overweight,
and could have a scar
from thyroid surgery on her neck.
- Oh, man!
- What a room.
Not bad.
- Have a look!
- For this we write him a postcard.
- And how do we send the message?
- As inconspicuously as possible.
Is that the West over there?
Yes.
Pretty close, isn't it?
EMBASSY OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Here, it's very close.
"We are being followed.
Please help us."
"lnterhotel Stadt Berlin. Room 3507."
You can just walk
into the American Embassy?
They have a kind of library.
Everyone is allowed in there.
We speak to no one and
we leave the carton somewhere.
Why don't we just call them?
The line is guaranteed to be tapped.
And you believe the Americans
will come here and pick us up?
Yes.
Just keep going.
Shit, they check everyone
who leaves the building.
It is teeming with Stasi here.
They are watching us.
Wait a moment...
- We are completely lost!
- Let's see.
- You know what I mean?
- I know...
- Give me the carton.
- What?
The carton.
- Distract him.
- Frank.
- Frank!
- Come along.
Hello?
Excuse me,
could you help us, please?
We want to go to
the Pergamon Museum.
You go down
Clara Zetkin Street.
To the end, and turn left.
In which direction?
- How long would it take?
- Ten, fifteen minutes.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Come on.
- That way.
- We're in!
- You are crazy!
- It worked!
- That was so brave!
- We have a hero here.
I do not know if I like this.
Until then, the coffee will be unavailable.
- The apricots cost even more.
- Earlier...
I hope the quota is not exceeded.
- Imagine if he had had to shoot.
- Oh! Watch out!
- We're wasting time.
- What balloon?
There was an attempt
with a hot air balloon.
- Really?
- Came down just short of the border.
No idea if they got them.
Well, they're rotting now
in a damp Stasi basement.
Yes.
Should we drive over to them?
If they were caught,
their house will be turned upside-down.
And we'd run right into the authorities.
They said: no contact.
Not knowing what's happened
is driving me crazy.
They are our friends.
They will be keeping it together.
I don't mean that:
What if they crashed?
- Maybe they made it.
- That would have gotten around long ago.
We should not have let them go.
I'm so afraid.
- I've won!
- How?
Here, here, here, here and here.
Let's play again.
Room service!
Just a moment.
Peter! Peter!
Run!
No!
Hello?
Hello?
- Mr. Strelzyk?
- Yes.
There's a man here at the reception.
Something has been delivered for you.
I'm coming down.
You stay here.
You, too.
Be careful.
Excuse me...
Did you receive our message?
The cigarette carton.
That's us.
The cigarettes.
Excuse me, my name is Strelzyk.
You said you had something for me?
Yes, Mr. Strelzyk.
Your wallet was by the pay phone.
Today's your lucky day.
Don't blame yourself.
We were so close.
- We were so close.
- I know.
Only a few kilometers further.
Or a half.
300, 400 meters.
Why couldn't I keep the thing
in the air longer?
It wasn't your fault.
So far, everything in my
life that I have done,
somehow, hasn't worked out.
And now this.
The most important thing in my life.
You and the children.
I have failed.
I've completely failed.
Peter, no...
Shit...
But we flew, father.
- You did not fail, father.
- Yes?
You've brought us up.
Without the moisture in the clouds,
we would have succeeded.
And now?
Do we want to wait
until the Stasi is at the door?
We could build another balloon.
Yes. Why not?
We do not have the time.
It took us two years.
But we know how to do it now.
- We cannot do this without Günter.
- Then, we'll ask him!
They want to leave, too.
We just have to build it bigger.
Maybe they are right.
You want to get
into a balloon again?
No, I really do not want to.
But I'm afraid we have to.
We don't have tent nylon,
only taffeta fabric.
How much do we need?
200 metres.
Oh, I'll have to inquire at the warehouse.
That's at least 200 meters of taffeta.
Sure.
- Let's go!
- Why?
Come on, go, Come on.
- What was that?
- She didn't have to call the warehouse.
The fabric was there in the store.
They are reporting anyone who
tries to buy large quantities.
Then, we need to buy small quantities.
Ten meters, 20 meters.
Then we won't be
finished until Christmas.
We can split up the purchases.
If each of us
buys 20 meters,
we won't raise
their suspicions.
Petra and Günter, too.
Spacing it out,
we can go to the same stores.
Yes...
We probably have no other choice.
Message from Berlin:
"A family wanted to buy
200 meters of taffeta."
"But then they suddenly disappeared."
They are trying once more.
What... you mean a second balloon?
They cannot be that stupid.
Not stupid.
Just desperate.
They are starting to make mistakes.
This will make it easier for us.
- They could have come from Berlin.
- No.
They're coming from the area down here.
They know the territory.
That's why they picked
the shortest route to the south.
For that they'd need the North wind.
Which is rare.
They'd have to be able
to react immediately.
Oh God!
Come in, come in.
Well, the balloon worked.
It flew!
You said: The balloon
could catch fire.
When the gas runs out, we crash.
Is there something, anything,
that could reassure me?
Yes. They cannot shoot us.
We are too high for that.
That's what you say to a
woman with a fear of heights.
Petra, if you join in,
then we can do it.
They took me in.
- When do you need it?
- In six weeks.
- He cannot even get out on the weekends.
- We have to get gas.
I cannot sew every night.
Günter, the Stasi is after us.
They are not going to stop.
Sooner or later they will get us.
Alright then.
I could go on sick leave.
Maybe then I could
get the thing done.
But the opportunity for
the North wind is zero.
If necessary,
you'll have to leave without me.
- I'm not leaving without you...
- I have to report to barracks.
If I don't show up,
they'll pick me up.
At least you'd be over there
with the little ones.
You'll be able to see your mother.
But I can't do this without you.
We'll use umbrella silk
and tent nylon.
We can't be too heavy.
You wanted to build an airplane?
- That was not the problem.
- Then, what was?
The runaway.
Here. I have already made the calculations.
For the new balloon,
we'll need 4200 cubic meters.
That's 1300 square meters of fabric.
The shops around here
don't have that much material.
Buy seven, twelve
or 15 meters at a time.
The more I have to put together,
the faster I can work.
With luck we'll get the motor
for the fan running again.
We have to fix the burner.
We have to solve the gas pressure problem.
And we need a new gondola.
- How thick is the floor now?
- 0.8 centimeter.
0.8?
- It won't hold us.
- Of course it will hold.
Can I jump on it?
Yes!
- It holds.
- Yes, it holds!
You want to come with me?
Kite-flying lesson?
- I'm pretty busy.
- What's so important?
Well, I have to help my dad.
- We're building something.
- What are you building?
- A surprise for my mother.
- He won't miss you, if you take a break.
Take a little break.
Where are you going?
We have to get ready.
- We're just going kite flying.
- I'll be right back!
- Finished.
- I'll go, right?
Uh-huh.
Enough!
Come on!
Wonderful.
Want to hold it?
Do you want to kiss me?
What?
OFFICE OF ERICH MIELKE,
MINISTER FOR STATE SECURITY
I don't give a shit!
Over 300 people in the field
and we're discussing sewing machines!
Find these bandits!
We have now have the
backing of the Politburo.
Resources are in place. We need time.
They've eluded us.
The old man is right.
If someone can get away with this,
we're standing here with our pants down.
Then our assholes face
the state's coat of arms.
I intend my career to
take a different trajectory.
Let's enjoy the capital,
as long as we can.
- Damn it!
- Why can't we keep the pressure up?
- Because the bottles freeze.
- And then we have to heat them.
We can't connect a heater.
- I can't think of anything else.
- Your thoughts are elsewhere.
- You don't mean Klara, do you?
- Look...
We are in this up to our necks.
- I don't know...
- Nah!
- Her father is with the Stasi!
- It's not her fault!
You will not see her anymore.
Understood?
- Wait a moment...
- What?
That's it!
We just turn the bottle over!
Then the gas comes out liquid.
It does not matter,
it evaporates immediately.
The gas was liquid at
the bottom and freezing.
That's why the
pressure was missing.
We'll use the liquid gas from the bottom.
This will give us a bigger flame,
because the gas will have more pressure.
- It's open.
- Yes! We did it! Yes!
- Yes!
What if we don't like it in the West?
Then we can come right
back home, no?
But we will definitely like it.
I will miss my friends.
And we will never get to see
grandma and grandpa again?
They will understand.
They understand.
Can we not at least say goodbye?
It is better if they do not know anything.
Otherwise they will go to jail.
Don't worry so much, ok?
You will find many new friends.
- What's going on?
- We're going to sew here.
- My neighbors ask questions.
- The Stasi live right across the street!
Yes, well, Günter will sew quietly.
I'm going to the lake. Want to come?
- I can't.
- Just the two of us.
Nah, can't do it. Unfortunately.
Maybe tomorrow?
♪ I'm tying an apron ♪
♪ And swept the room out ♪
Good job.
It's Lena's turn.
Mom works at the post office.
I collect stamps.
- And your dad?
- My dad, also.
- He's also at the post office?
- No! He also collects stamps.
And you, Peter?
- What is your dad's profession?
- My dad is a tailor.
I thought he drives an ambulance.
That, too. But he sits all day
at a sewing machine.
- Really?
- Yes.
What is he sewing?
- Do you know?
- I'm not allowed to talk about it.
But you can tell me anything.
The weather forecast:
Tonight in the north and central area,
overcast with occasional rain.
Cloudy to clear in the south.
Lowest temperatures around
eleven degrees Celsius.
Cloudy during the day...
In five days, he has to
report to barracks.
We can't do this.
We have to get the balloon
ready before then.
But we need the right wind.
Then you can forget it.
He has to join the Army,
and we'll have to go without him.
And then our children grow up
without their father.
The kids today
were asked in kindergarten
what their parents do by profession.
And Peter said
his father is a tailor.
I told him
that we sew tents
for campsites.
A tent.
I hate camping.
I can not feel my fingers anymore.
We're over half done.
- This man is a sewing machine.
- Are you taking me home?
- The sewing machine has to go to bed.
- OK.
Wait a minute.
The Stasi is still at work.
We should come up with something,
for why you come out so late every night.
That was again...
a very nice evening... I have to say.
Honey... can you drive at all?
- A little bit, right?
- They should hear us.
- That was close!
- Get home safe!
Bye, you two! Bye!
Bye!
Bye!
Can you tell me what
are you accusing me of?
Are you sure you don't know?
I do not know anything about any balloon!
How many times do I have to tell you this?
Eyes forward.
- Your truck broke down?
- Yes.
The engine is constantly dying.
There are no spare parts here.
So you were standing there,
in the middle of the night.
- What time again?
- Just before eleven.
- Not many cars passed, right?
- No, only one.
With a trailer.
The tape recorder can not see you.
Yes, with a trailer.
Can you describe them?
Well, it was pretty dark, so...
A Wartburg with a trailer.
Man, woman, two children.
- Just like the textile store in Berlin.
- We're making him nervous.
"The People's Police
request your assistance."
- "The Enlightenment ..."
- Let's not go crazy.
- Almost everyone has one.
- But not a barometer modified like this.
We can finish the thing quickly.
We're only waiting on the fabric.
- How much is left to be done?
- It could be done today.
Maybe we can get
enough by tomorrow.
We can't buy any
more in this area.
We could try in Halle.
Or near Erfurt.
We cannot make any more mistakes.
It will be peculiar if we all
purchase the same material in succession.
I have an eye for these things.
My husband says this, too.
He, however, can be unreliable...
- Do you know what model of car it was?
- Not a Trabi.
- A Wartburg, perhaps?
- Yes!
Parked it there,
where the comrade is standing.
Did you happen to get the license plate?
- Definitely an N, district Gera.
- Are you sure?
Oh yes, I'm sure!
My niece is from Pößneck.
She has a license plate like that, too.
I wondered, "Why buy it here?"
District Gera. The lead came
from the shop assistant in Naumburg.
We reconstructed a gas bottle label.
It is almost certainly
from a gas station in Pößneck.
And that's exactly... here.
From there
It's not far to the launch site.
Schirra should get all forces readied.
We received the medical report.
The doctors' offices
have already closed.
Then, we check the pharmacies.
I'm trying to find out
something about the children.
- You can get back to work right now.
- Why?
The guys with the balloon
are from here, from Pößneck.
- You're sure?
- Yes.
The comrades from Gera
are already on the way.
I'm all coming together.
I understand what I'm asking, believe me.
I only ask this
because it's the last chance
to prevent something
very bad from happening.
What do you want to know?
Has any of the kids
mentioned anything about their home?
- Anything unusual.
- What do you mean?
For example, that the parents
like to tinker with large projects.
Or sew things.
And who are you?
You have to tell me what your name is,
if you want the ball.
Peter.
And your family name?
- Here, Peter.
- Thank you.
Yes, there are things being sewn.
Flags for example. And pennants.
For the celebration
of the 30th anniversary of our Republic.
Indeed?
Yes.
There are a lot of people involved.
We can really be proud of this.
Are you nuts?
Inviting your neighbor over!
In this weather, we can forget it.
They'll get us anyway.
Frank,
if it is because of this Stasi woman...
- She is not with the Stasi!
- You're putting us in danger!
Imagine if you let something
slip out to this butterfly...
You do not trust me!
I do trust you.
- But the whole family is at risk...
- Then go without me!
Just pull yourself together.
- There you are.
- Did you get it?
Yes, everything is there.
I've found a liftoff
location, too.
Well. I'm finished the
day after tomorrow.
- After that, I pause for a week.
- I'll make you coffee.
PHARMACY
Six people receive the thyroid remedy.
How many relatives share the drug?
- I cannot say.
- Approximately.
Here in this area, there are perhaps
200 patients with a diagnosis of goiter.
I want to search them all.
- What about the other pharmacies?
- There are two. Both smaller.
Check both.
We are looking for people
with a workshop and a sewing machine.
With gas bottles lying around.
Alfeld: Sperlingweg.
Altmann: Poplar Avenue.
The storms follow
a cold front at night.
- Dad, I wanted...
- Shh...!
...dropping in Bavaria.
Until the beginning
of the week,
there will be a steady
wind from the north,
at a speed of 30 km/h.
The North wind.
Günter! It's beginning!
The North wind!
- Day after tomorrow!
- What?
I just heard it on the radio.
I'll go fill up the propane tanks.
Can you help Günter?
So many police.
I can already see myself in jail.
- And this will support us all?
- Of course!
We could fit three more!
Hello, Frank.
- Are you alone?
- Yes.
What is it?
If we could get away to the West,
would you come with me?
- What are you talking about?
- We have a place for you.
- You want to go over?
- You can come with me.
You just have to decide quickly.
- What?
- I'm serious.
You have a nerve!
Hello, Frank.
- What are you doing here?
- I'll get my coat.
- Are you going to the pharmacy?
- Yes.
- Can you get me headache pills?
- Yes.
What is your father
doing at the pharmacy?
They are looking for someone.
The Stasi are going to pharmacies.
They are looking for someone.
- How do you know?
- From Klara.
- Frank, I have told you...
- They are checking prescriptions!
We can not wait until tomorrow.
- Can we wait until tonight?
- We have to.
- Someone has to tell Petra.
- I'll do it.
You can take my moped.
Come on, Fitscher,
we need the trailer.
Can we come in?
Did something happen?
Forgot the keys.
Petra is waiting for us.
And who is this?
This is you.
That is your grandma.
Here we are.
Stop, stop!
Bang! Bang! You're dead!
Stop! Stop, you traitor!
The wind is getting stronger.
We'll get over there faster.
These tracks are not the same length.
They don't match.
- That's a huge hole.
- The pressure is on the ropes.
If they are well-knotted,
it should work.
We sew over it.
We've gone through almost all of them.
Maybe the old woman at the
fabric store got it wrong.
Or the suspect gets her
medication somewhere else.
- We've overlooked something.
- "Doris Strelzyk."
Strelzyk?
Those are our neighbors.
Do they have a car, too?
A Wartburg, blue.
- He also has a flag, but...
- Job?
Electrical engineer.
A true inventor.
Down here in the basement!
I was just with the son... Frank...
Saw him this afternoon.
Yes, he was so casual, so...
There was a guy and his wife...
who have been visiting lately.
Does he have a name?
Wetzel, Günter Wetzel.
General alert:
blue Wartburg, with trailer.
Roadblocks at local exits.
Take in this Wetzel.
Put the border troops on alert.
I need a helicopter.
You did not know anything!
What is keeping them?
Quickly, quickly...
I have to do something quick.
Crap. We take the other road.
We really have to go.
- Where to put it?
- Behind the trailer.
Shit.
- Papers, please.
- What's going on here?
Papers, please...
I... I just had it...
Searching for the Wetzel family.
Paul, is that a Wartburg with a trailer?
Get going. Go! Move along!
What's keeping them?
- What's wrong?
- The fucking engine.
If it gets too hot,
the piston jams.
- So what now?
- Push. And wait till it cools down.
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel!
Captain Merz,
Grenzabschnitt 46,
ready for area search!
The section of Frankenheim
to the border is on alert!
- What about the helicopters?
- Ready to go.
Shit! Shit!
- There you are!
- All good.
- Alright?
- Yes.
- Grab the rope in front.
- Fitscher, come!
- What was going on?
- All hell's breaking loose.
- Did you knot everything?
- Yes.
Then I'll start the engine.
All forces in position?
All border troops on alert.
They are not getting through here.
Well, we can go.
Come help me get the little ones.
It's starting.
Come on.
This is a hot air balloon.
You do not need to be afraid.
My gloves!
Good, let's go.
Ready? One, two, three.
And off.
- Oh no.
- Frank, what's going on?
- That won't work!
- Once more!
- Cut the rope through!
- The knife!
- Hold tight!
- Help him!
- I can't do it!
- Pull the rope! Take it out!
- Papa! Firmly!
- Come on!
Fire! Fire!
- It's burning!
- Shit!
Where's the fire extinguisher?
Got it.
- You OK?
- Yes.
Frank, you're bleeding!
Sighting west of Blankenstein.
That's near us.
557 Here. Fly directly to the border.
Turn off on insert section.
Shit.
Those are search lights.
Is that the border?
- Possibly.
- That's a long way off.
There. There he is.
Confirmed sighting in the mission section.
Object is located at about 1800 m.
♪ All kids call him:
Bummi, Bummi. ♪
♪ Bummi, Bummi,
brumm, brumm, brumm... ♪
♪ Bummi, Bummi... ♪
- The fuel line is freezing up.
- This can't be happening.
- Now the gas is faltering.
- We had so much to burn.
We're falling.
557 here.
Have lost visual.
What the hell...
We still need to save
some for the landing.
I know. Wait a minute.
It's coming.
There, ahead.
That's it.
Cold, mom...
I'm cold, mom...
They probably ran out of fuel.
- They cannot have gotten any further.
- Now we can get them.
Bypass our position.
Cut off the entire area.
557 here,
border section Blankenstein.
The object is descending
a kilometer from the border.
It's going down pretty fast.
Damn, there's a power line!
Hold on tight!
- Damn it! My leg!
- Günter!
Out!
Come over.
Günter, I'll help you.
Come here. I've got him.
- Here.
- Did we do it?
- Did we cross over?
- How long were we up?
- 28 minutes.
- What? Only that long?
That way's south.
Come on, Peter, let's take a look around.
You wait here.
- Well?!
- No sightings yet, Lieutenant Colonel!
What are you doing there?
- Are we in the West?
- No. In Upper Franconia.
- Yes!
- We are in the West!
- We are in the West!
- We made it!
Yes! Come here!
Yes!
What are we supposed to do now?
What an effort.
- How many of you are there?
- We are in the West! Yup!
TEN YEARS LATER
How many cold nights
will we have to spend here?
That was the question
that moved everyone,
while Hans-Dietrich Genscher informed
the embassy officials inside.
"Freedom!" chants the crowd,
as the Federal Foreign Minister
announces the upcoming departure.
We come to you...
to let you know,
that your departure today
is now possible.
That evening they began.
several small steps to freedom.
No one would have expected
it to happen so fast.
Scenes of Joy.
If you had told me this a year ago,
I would have had you committed.
- Can we go somewhere else today?
- Sure. Where do you want to go?
Home, to my parents.
With my wife.
She has to overcome her fear of flying.
Well then...
