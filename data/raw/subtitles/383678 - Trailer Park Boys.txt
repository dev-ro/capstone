Come on in, boys.
Sorry, I just woke up.
So, what do you want to talk about?
Whatever--
Oh, man...
I got to go get Ray
in here anyways.
Check that out.
That is a 350, 5.7L tuned port injection.
Can't get any better than that.
Guess what year this is?
Guess.
'90.
'87.
Pretty good shape, eh?
Yo,
are you ready?
I'll be there in ten minutes, alright?
Be waiting outside because
I'm not coming in.
Got it?
Alright.
That was Ricky.
Ricky's my partner.
This is my 9mm.
Bought one for Ricky last
year for his birthday.
Small, compact, easy loading, fast action.
Good little starter gun.
Go to 20 Smith. That's where
I'm going to pick up Ricky.
Next message.
Hey, it's me. I am home.
You're gonna have to come get me.
You gotta get over here. We
gotta do this one more job.
That's $600 and I need
it for my fucking woman.
I saved your ass. Just a sec...
Lucy, I'm using the bathroom and
I'm on the phone with a customer.
Just hurry up. I got to get in there.
Not a problem. I'll be out here
in two seconds. Just get out.
Anyway, I'm talking to a customer.
Customer?
Steve, we work with.
It's not fucking Julian, Lucy!
Don't you fucking lie to me!
Lucy, fuck off!
Give me the phone!
- Give me the phone!
- Fuck.
- How many times have I told you.
- Look, I'm really sorry about this, Steve.
Can't believe your doing
this to a customer.
Come pick me up in the morning.
- Lucy, give me the fucking phone.
- Hello. Fuck you! Who you talking to?
It's fucking Julian, isn't it?
- It's some Steve guy. A customer.
- What are you doing? Give me the fucking phone.
- Is this Julian?
Come pick me up for fuck sakes.
Please.
End of message.
- Hi Julian.
- Where's your dad?
He's inside with my mom.
I don't think she likes you very much.
Yeah, well, she got problems.
Do you have a smoke?
I was talking to a Steve
guy that I met from work.
He's a client.
Do you have a light?
I met him at work.
I thought you were trying to quit.
I am.
You know what that costs.
That costs 50 cents per use.
What are you guys doing?
We're doing a documentary
about your dad and Julian.
- I'm working and that's final.
- Oh.
- ...Frankie or Freddie, it was...
- Lucy,
I told you I talked
to a guy named Steve.
I'm going to be gone three fucking
hours working for him.
That's all I know. That's it.
So, it wasn't Julian?
Where's my fucking gun, Lucy?
- Holy fuck. I told you 15 times.
- You all set?
I didn't talk to Julian.
So, you saying that Julian is not going
to show up here out of the blue?
There's a fucking gun right here.
If Julian shows up, it's
not fucking because of me.
What in the fuck is going on here?
So, I decided to hire this
film crew to document my life.
I've got a feeling something
is going to happen to me.
You ever get that feeling?
So, you know,
to have a bit of my life on film, I
thought it would be pretty cool.
I always looked up to Clint
Eastwood and people like that.
Different movies.
I just thought it would be kinda cool.
You know?
People can watch it and learn from it.
I'm not that bad
of a guy really.
I'm just trying to make a few dollars.
I'm a businessman.
I don't need this shit right now.
I just need my gun and I need my belongings
and I have to go to work to bring some
god damned money home to this family.
Jesus!
Who the fuck are these guys?
- Why is there a TV crew in my living room?
- I don't know.
- Why am I on TV in my house, asshole?
- I'll explain later. Let's go.
You show up here unexpected.
I didn't fucking call you
to come here, Did I?
Tell her that.
I never talked to Julian, did I?
Did I talk to you today? No!
I'm taking these cigarettes
cause I got none left.
You're taking my last smokes?
There's three here.
Here fucking take one.
I'm only going to be gone for a few hours.
You're going to take my last smokes?
Lucy, I don't need this shit right now.
You turn off your fucking camera and
whoever this guy is with the mic.
- Get these fucking guys out of here.
- Let's go.
I don't need this shit.
I'm fucking trying to have a
discussion with my wife here.
- You show up, unexpectedly.
- I'm not your fucking wife!
I meant fiancee!
- Get the hell out!
- Fiancee.
Go off with your fucking friend!
I really need this today? No.
This is bullshit!
What does your mom think of Julian?
She thinks he's an idiot.
Julian...
Well, Julian is Ricky's best
friend from when they were kids.
They grew up together
in the trailer park.
I didn't have many friends growing up.
But, Ricky kinda tagged along with me.
Bought a bit of weed off me.
Used to get stoned and have a few drinks.
He kinda grew on me.
Since they grew up together,
they got into a lot of trouble.
They've been in and out of
prison together because of--
I think Julian is pretty smart.
He's probably the one who
gets them into trouble.
I don't really understand
why it's a problem.
Ever since Lucy met Julian
a couple years back,
she doesn't like us hanging
out for some reason.
Lucy,
she's a trailer park hoe.
There's nothing wrong with that
if you're attracted to them.
I know Julian. I knew
Julian before I knew Ricky.
Julian and I went out for a
little while when I was 16.
That's...
that was a long time ago.
I hate him.
Lucy hates my guts and I
don't like her either.
Doesn't bother me.
She put me through hell.
16 years old, we were at
this party one night.
Got pretty drunk.
You ever have those nights where
you just totally blank out
and wake up the next morning?
I had one of those nights and...
woke up with her next
to me in bed naked.
I didn't know what
the hell happened.
I just got out of there.
I didn't know what I was doing
and I think I was sort of
attracted to his dangerous side.
I don't need that kind of thing anymore.
Ricky hooks up with her
and becomes engaged.
His first girlfriend.
One of those first girlfriend things.
He's engaged now and I don't
have the heart to tell him.
I used to fix cars a
little bit on the side.
Used to sell a bit of dope too and she
had a friend whose car broke down.
So they called me up.
I don't know if it was to fix
the car or the dope, whatever.
Usually I have dope on me, so I
went over and fixed the car.
Lucy was there and I couldn't
help but notice her.
She's an attractive woman.
Thanks, hun.
One thing led to another.
We were drunk at a party and
kinda been going from there.
I can't understand it.
He's working hard paying bills.
She sits around the house
all day smoking cigarettes.
Doing God knows what else.
Julian's a problem.
Julian is not a problem.
Julian is the reason we
can afford this house.
Anyway, moving on.
- Why don't you stay here with me?
- Lucy! Lucy!
- I want you to stay
here with Trinity and I.
- Lucy! I don't want to
here about it anymore.
I've got to go to work with him.
That's the only way I have
a way around right now.
Remember I lost my license.
Jesus!
Don't slam the door in my face!
Daddy's got to go to work for
a couple of hours, okay?
I'll be back.
If mommy see that, you know
what's going to happen.
You should go around
back and smoke that.
Julian and Ricky are giving
her smokes all the time.
How old are you now? Six?
- Five?
- Six.
She's six and she's addicted to cigarettes.
I don't give her any cigarettes
I don't believe in that actually.
I think Lucy gives
her the odd one
and Julian gives her
smokes once in a while.
Once in a while?
I'm trying to get her to stop smoking.
Put this down.
I want her to stop smoking
so we put her on the patch.
Show them the patch.
We got her on the patch.
We tried her on the nicotine gum
but she got really sick off it.
You know about the patch, honey?
What did I tell you about the patch?
- Never smoke with the patch on.
- ...smoke with the patch on.
Trinity just go in the house!
Don't burn yourself!
Don't come over here, Lucy.
Don't get in that car
with him, he's drinking!
No shit!
- Who cares? I got to go to work.
- He's drinking and driving.
He's had a couple drinks.
It's not a big deal, Lucy.
Lucy's got a real problem
with me drinking and driving.
It's none of her business what I do.
Ricky got caught drinking and driving
and now he can't drive anywhere.
I'd say that's Julian's fault.
People who get caught drinking
and driving are stupid.
For instance, Ricky.
They got this limit thing.
You can only be below the limit.
Smells like liquor in here.
We were at a party and I slept
outside on a picnic table.
Ricky decides to go home because Lucy
was going nuts, falling on shit.
He had to go and lost his license.
He didn't care and kept
driving for a couple years.
He got stopped again because
he was driving drunk.
When the cops found out his
was drinking and driving
but also had an expired
license they went ballistic.
They hook you up to this
bloody computer machine thing.
You got to blow in a straw and I don't
think they're reliable because I was fine.
According to them I was a
little over the limit.
They fine you and take you away.
It's a big hassle.
What's the big deal having
a few beers driving home?
His license got taken away
and we don't have a way
of getting around.
We don't live in the park
anymore close to our friends.
We have to rely on Julian.
Where are you going?
I'm going to work.
How many times do I need to tell you that?
You're going to hire a couple of whores?
Lucy, that was two fucking years ago.
We don't need to talk about that today.
I fucking hate you, you asshole!
Lucy, get back here!
Get back here and give me a kiss!
Fucker!
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
It don't fucking matter.
Don't be doing coke in
my driveway you idiot.
- Are we ready?
- Yes.
What is with the fucking
guy and the camera?
Told you I'd tell you later.
What's wrong with you today?
You're not yourself at all.
What the fuck's going on?
Huh?
Do you believe in psychics?
I guess so. I don't know.
Depends on what you're talking about.
What's going on?
I was told I was going to die in 5 days.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Fuck man, that's not good.
When did this happen?
The other night. I gave him a call.
A phone psychic?
Man are you fucking retarded.
I don't believe in those
fucking assholes.
That's not a psychic, man.
That's $5.99 a minute.
Let's get some food.
Fuck! Squirrel! Squirrel!
Fuck!
Fuck!
- Did you get him?
- No, man.
I got a joke for you, man.
It might cheer your fucking
sorry ass up because
you're fucking grumpy today
and it's pissing me off.
Ricky, you're not funny.
I don't want to hear any joke.
- No this is a good joke.
- You're not funny.
Here's the deal.
You bake a loaf of bread.
Okay?
Do they call you a baker? No.
You're not a baker because
you bake one loaf of bread.
You drive a truck.
Let's suppose you move some shit from
your old house to your new house.
You rent a truck and your
drive it for one day.
Does that make you a trucker?
Are people gonna call you a trucker? No.
You're not gonna be a a fucking trucker.
However,
you suck one cock...
You get it?
Get it, man?
You sucked a cock?
I didn't suck a cock.
No, what I'm saying is...
What are you trying to say?
You sucked a cock.
It's a fucking joke.
It's a fucking joke, man.
Can't you get it?
Ricky's got a bit of an attitude.
Ever since he's left this park,
he thinks he's above everybody.
Basically, this is the
trailer I grew up in.
I spent all my life there
until two years ago.
Finally got out of the park.
We were living with Ricky's parents.
His dad was drunk all the time.
He was a bad drunk.
My dad used to make homebrew
and everyone was coming
by and drinking.
It was a bad scene.
I didn't mind it.
Friends calling Lucy a trailer
park hoe and all this stuff.
You can't have that with
a little girl around.
So, here we are.
We are a lot happier now.
I won't be doing
this much longer
and we'll just have time
to spend with my family.
Ricky started growing some pot.
And he made a whack
of money doing it.
It's with all that money we got this place.
So we thought, why not move out?
Have a farm.
Urban farmer kind of thing.
At least it's normal.
Fine, you have to leave
the park because you want
to have a baby, get married,
have a good little white picket fence,
garage, backyard, basement type dwelling.
That's fine.
But, you are from the park.
You will always be from the park
and if you think you are better than
me because you don't live in the park
I don't have time for you.
If it was up to me, I'd still be here.
I like it here.
People are great, lots to do
here, always a party going on.
But you know, got a kid
with Lucy now to look after
and Lucy wanted to get the
hell out of the park.
I saved up some money and
got us a house in suburbia.
I could live in a nice house if I
wanted to because I got money.
I'm a hard working guy,
but I like where I live.
And there's nothing
wrong with that.
I don't know man.
I think you got a bit
of an attitude going.
Towards me, you know?
It's really bothering me lately.
Lately, you're a little fucked up.
I don't do as much coke
and stuff as you do.
We're not on the same wavelength,
you know what I'm saying?
And if I want to drink,
if I want to do a bit of coke,
smoke some weed,
sell some drugs,
drive around in my 'vette,
I'll do it.
Because that's who I am.
A lot of people can't understand me.
I got a family now, buddy.
I got responsibilities.
I can't be fucking drinking everyday,
doing coke everyday.
I mean I'll still do a little
bit, but that's different.
I got responsibilities now.
Basically, family to me
is all that matters.
When you got a family, life changes.
You can't always be out drunk all the time.
You can't be doing drugs.
You can't be selling drugs.
You can't be driving around
like a friggin' maniac.
Your wife asks you to do stuff, you do it.
That's what family is to me.
I go to work for a short
amount of time as possible.
I don't do drugs anymore.
I hardly ever drink, apart from
the odd beer with my friends.
I smoke a joint here and there,
but I'm not doing coke and heroin
and everything else you do
in the park once in a while.
I didn't want to be there anymore.
I knew there was something better.
And so here we are.
In this great place.
Anyway,
I'm happy where I'm at,
you're happy here, that's fine.
Everybody's different.
I got a family. You don't.
I've got a little kid. You don't.
You've got an attitude. I don't.
I live in the park. You don't.
You think you're better
than me but you're not.
Listen, buddy.
Once a trailer park boy,
always a trailer park boy.
Remember that.
That's what it's all about.
I may not live here anymore
but I'm still from here.
No, we can do it no problem.
We going to have to meet. Just one second.
Just one second. I got a call.
Hello?
Lucy! Lucy! Just a second!
Just a second!
Listen, I got to go.
I got a customer on the other line.
2 o'clock.
Dairy Queen parking lot.
$350. Tens and twenties.
Yep.
Alright, bye.
Lucy, what did I fucking tell you?
Don't call me on this fucking phone.
Oh, for fuck sakes.
Lucy, I got to go.
There's some fucking jackasses here.
I'll call you right back.
Hey man, what's up?
What in the fuck are
you guys doing here?
What are you guys doing here?
- Wondering if we can get some stuff?
- Did you see the fucking TV crew here?
You're just going to pull up and interrupt?
You guys don't even know
what's going on here, do you?
Don't have a fucking clue?
Can we get some stuff?
What time is it?
I don't know.
12 o'clock.
Alright, when do I open?
- Hey punk! What time do I open?
- 12 o'clock.
I miss hanging out with those guys.
It was like...
me and Cory
and Ricky
and Julian.
We were always kicking.
We rocked this place.
We own this park.
We used to rock the schoolyard.
We used to go there
early in the morning,
wait for the kids
to get off the bus
and kick the shit out of them
just for looking at us funny.
You know what I mean?
Just for wearing park clothes and shit.
Don't come around me 'til nine.
Alright.
Leave.
Boys, what are you doing?
- Just want to get some stuff.
- What the fuck!
Everyday you show up here in
the middle of the afternoon.
He never sells to you 'til 9 o'clock,
and every fucking
day, you come here!
What's going on?
When we were growing
up in the park,
they were always saying that Rick's
parent's were brother and sister.
I don't know if any
of that is true.
The guy is fucking nuts.
He's a prick.
Like, I don't know.
I hate that guy.
I don't hate him.
I don't hate him. I just...
you know what I mean.
You hate him.
No, I don't hate him.
It's cause of the camera.
Just fucking say it.
They're not going to see this shit.
Did you not notice we have
a little TV crew here?
Now, you guys are on film
trying to buy some dope.
Nice.
Shit.
Boys, I don't know what to say.
Get out of here.
They call you punk when
you're walking away and shit.
That's the thing, man.
I mean don't get me wrong.
All I wanted is to say it to my face.
If he thinks I'm a dick, say it to my face.
- But then don't keep inviting us back.
- He's never said it to my face.
He tells these guys
that we're dicks.
- They use our money.
- Say it to my face, buddy.
Knock, knock, boys.
What?
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Two fucking dumb idiots
that drive a big piece of
shit from the trailer park,
that don't know when to
come buy fucking dope.
Now get the fuck out of here.
Leave.
Jesus dude.
You don't have to be a dick and shit.
I'm not being a dick.
You guys are just fucking
driving me nuts.
And this is a biography, like one
of those guys, probably Rick,
sit there and tell you how he stole a car
or Julian will tell you how he did.
But you know what happened?
When they were like 13 years old,
I don't even know if it was Julian or Rick
I don't know who it was but one of the guys
got into a car, got in trouble
and got spanked and shit.
For taking their father's car and
backing in and out of the driveway.
And that's how they stole the car.
And then they walk around like two years
later saying they stole a car and shit.
But all they did was back
in and out of the driveway.
They didn't even go around
the block and shit.
They just backed in and out.
Anybody can do that.
His father spanked him.
- Spanked him in front of everyone in the park.
- Spanked him.
And called him home.
That's whack.
He got his bare ass slapped
right in front of him.
All the kids,
Scagnita,
Rodgrina
all the ladies were there.
It's just...
Aww, man.
You can't have that happening.
You know what I'm saying?
What time should we come back at?
Don't come back!
- What time should we come back at?
- Nine o'clock.
Nine o'clock?
What time is it now?
12 o'clock.
- 12 o'clock.
- For the third time you fucking dumb-ass.
Jesus Christ!
What a piece of shit!
Man, how can you sell
dope to dicks like that?
You're fucked.
You call me fucked?
Man, you got to choose your customers,
cause that is fucked up.
Oh, I'm going to get Mr. Rogers
in buying coke from me.
See you later you fucking dicks.
Jesus Christ!
I fucking come to the
trailer park once a week
and I have to deal with that shit?
Let's just go fucking
take care of this job.
Fuck!
I take care of people's problems.
They give me a call and I take care of it.
I don't like what I do,
but somebody's gotta do it.
We got clients that we have
to perform services for.
Something like that.
I love that.
"Clients."
I started up my business
five years ago.
It took a long time to
get a good client base.
After five years you're
pretty well in there.
You'd be surprised.
When I started here,
I said "How many people are going
to want this kind of service."
Our phone rings nonstop.
It's fucking nuts.
I don't know exactly
what it is that he does,
but he's getting out of it and
he's going to get a different job.
People call us up and they pay
us to do odd jobs, basically.
Are you fucking dicks almost ready?
There's people around here.
We want to get this over with.
You guys gotta keep up.
I don't mind if you follow us around,
but fucking keep up.
Ricky, keep the swearing down, alright?
- We're in a neighbourhood.
- Step aside.
I'm kicking the door in.
- I've got a screwdriver.
- Fuck the screwdriver, man.
- Just let me kick this--
- Ricky.
You want to screw this up?
Just hurry the fuck up.
You got to make sure the timing's right.
And the timing is a key thing.
If you do a job and the timing
is not at the right time,
then you're going to
fuck everything up.
That's not what I do.
I'm a professional.
Hello?
It's Mr. Peterson from next door.
Just checking the pipes.
Okay, we're clear.
We're looking for a black cat here.
It's about eight to ten months old.
It's been fucking the neighbour around.
I guess he's got a bird feeder and
the cats been fucking around,
eating all the birds.
Actually, there's the fucker right there.
Fuck!
Come here you little fucker.
- I'll scare him out the other side.
- Okay.
Make a hissing noise.
Got 'em?
Fuck, I had him.
Fuck!
You little fucker!
See, this is the kind of
shit we got to put up with.
Sometimes little cats fuck us around.
That's why I don't like to do cats.
There's so much shit under this bed.
It's impossible to see
the little bastard.
You don't want to fuck
the place up too much.
People come home and see everything
fucked up and cops are here.
He's right over here.
Fuck!
We're not doing cats anymore, Ricky.
Come on, let's play.
You little fucker.
I got him over here. I got him.
Got him.
Let me see him.
You little fuck face.
Take him out.
Fucking us around, are you?
Yep.
Okay.
Yes, it is.
Yep.
Yeah, we could probably take care
of that for you today.
Throw me some of that.
There he is.
About fucking time.
Basically, I guess you could
say were kinda like...
like pest control.
Not really a dog catcher
or anything like that.
If someone's got a problem with their pets
and like no one else will take care of it,
cause it costs a lot of money.
If you had to go to the SPCA and
have something performed like we do,
it would cost you
an arm and a leg.
You know, that's
where we come in.
Give me some of that.
Whoa! What are you doing?
- I'm having a sip of your drink.
- Let go of my drink.
- What are you talking about?
- Let go of my drink. Let go.
- Just give me a drink.
- I'm paying for this.
Do you got three bucks?
I don't have a cent until you pay me today.
Then let go of my drink.
- Give me a sip.
- Let it go.
Let go, Ricky.
God!
Get out.
Fuck.
I'll cover up front. Hurry up.
That's the subject right there.
Anyway, you guys just wait back here.
I don't want you seeing this and
I'll be out in a couple of seconds.
Just wait back there by the chimney there.
Ricky, stop fucking around, will ya?
Dogs especially can really fuck you around.
And even cats.
People buy them thinking they're going
to be the greatest pets in the world but
no, it's not the case.
Once you got a pet, what the
fuck are you supposed to do?
You can't just get rid of it.
No one is going to come and take it.
No one is going to help you out.
So, you call us up and we'll
take care of the problem.
And I'd say we're very reasonably
priced for what we do.
Fucker!
Three o'clock at the ferry
terminal and don't be late.
We're waiting on two other
dicks and they're very late.
Tens and twenties. Peace.
There's the fucking
guys right there.
You guys, the guys?
- Yeah, we're them.
- We'll, you're late.
- Couldn't be helped.
- What the fucks going on, guys?
- I said one o'clock. It's ten after.
- Hey, chill man.
Had to wait for the old lady to split.
Don't be fucking telling
me to chill, man.
Let's get it done.
It's not a problem.
It's a little poodle at your house.
How do we get in?
You gotta break in and looked
like the dog got in the way.
If we're breaking in, that's an extra $100.
Not a problem.
- I hate that fucking dog.
- Shut the fuck up, Clint.
Okay, let's do it then.
- Where's the money?
- Right here.
- So the extra hundred makes three?
- Whoa, whoa, what's this shit?
What in the fuck is that?
It's a chequebook, man.
I said tens and twenties.
I don't take fucking cheques.
Fine, we'll go to a fucking bank machine.
No, no, chill!
Let's go to a bank machine
and we'll get it done.
Alright, let's fucking go right now.
This is bullshit!
- Butt me, man.
- Fuckin' Enrico Suave here.
Butt me!
I only got four cigarettes left.
- Give me the fucking smoke. Now! Now!
- You got a chequebook. Buy a pack.
Can you ask me a little nicer?
- I'm sick of this shit.
- Take the gun.
Go around back.
Get inside.
I'll make sure everything's cool
out here and I'll met you inside.
So, I'm breaking in again?
- Yes, you are breaking in again.
- Just like the last ten fucking times.
Who pays the bills? Me.
I am responsible for your family, buddy.
Not you.
You're getting soft, man.
No, I'm not.
Get in there.
Breaking and enter? That's
fucking grade 10 shit.
And I'm fucking sick of it.
A fucking alarm system?
Go upstairs and take care of the dog.
I'm going to get something
in the kitchen, alright?
- I'm fucking pissed off.
- Go upstairs.
- I am pissed off! I don't need this shit!
- Go upstairs.
Man, I cannot shot this little dog.
Look at this guy.
Shoot him.
I'm not shooting this dog.
You shoot him.
No, you shoot him.
- You're fucking getting soft.
- Who's the boss here?
- I don't give a shit. You're getting soft.
- Who is the boss? I am the boss.
I shot the last two dogs.
I broke into the house.
- I am not shooting this dog.
- I pay you money to shoot dogs.
Now shoot the dog.
I'm not shooting this dog.
Yes, you are.
I'll be in the car. Take it!
Do you want to get paid today?
- This is bullshit!
- Mr. I need to pay rent because my wife won't work.
Oh, for fuck sakes!
Nothing personal, alright?
Fuck!
You know, through this business, we've
been doing this for a while now.
Julian's been doing it
a lot longer than me but
it seems that every case is
pretty straight forward.
You get a call. You get the money.
You go and take care of it that
day or the next at the latest.
For some reason, Patrick Lewis
and this god damned dog of his
have been fucking us
around for three months.
Right now, the expenses are up $300.
We're only getting paid $600 for the job.
But right now, it's principle.
This guy really pisses me off.
Camera rolling?
Looking for him. He's on his lunch hour.
Oh, my fuck. He's right over there.
That's him.
Who the hell are you guys?
Ah, fuck!
Alright, asshole. Give us the fucking dog!
I'm sick of this shit.
- Give us your dog.
- Give us the dog!
Give me your fucking dog!
Get over here!
- Both of you guys are dicks.
- Give us the dog!
You see this. You fucking see that.
Do you wanna get shot?
I'll shoot you and you're fucking
dog right here, right now.
- Give us the dog! Put it in the trunk.
- Fuck you!
Pop your trunk.
- Put the fucking dog in the trunk.
- Cock suckers.
Caesar's great.
Awesome.
Awesome dog.
He'll come down,
play catch. We'll play it everyday.
He's relentless.
He's always going.
Lot's of energy.
You're a good boy, aren't you, Caesar?
Yes, you are.
I'd say we tried 15 times
to fucking kill that dog
and we can't get him.
He fucks us around.
He's always in public places.
He changes his schedule
walking his dog everyday.
We met up with him a
few times already and
starts mouthing off at us and stuff,
saying he's not afraid of us.
That's the whole part of the job.
You wanna inflict a little bit of
terror into the people you're after.
There's these two trailer park
dicks trying to kill my dog.
I know that sounds crazy,
but they are.
They're trying to kill my dog.
Grab the dog, Ricky.
- Give me the fucking dog.
- Listen, buddy.
- Give me the fucking dog.
- This is my dog.
- Don't! Frig off!
- Ricky! Come on!
Officers, these guys are
trying to kill my dog.
This man is drunk and he's
soliciting us for prostitution.
- That's a lie, buddy.
- You're drunk.
This guy comes up to our
window soliciting us.
He's a prostitute.
- And he's drunk.
- Yeah right, dick.
If you check him, guarantee
you'll find some alcohol.
- I don't need this shit!
- He's lying.
He's lying, guys.
We don't need this stuff.
We're fucking coming along
with a camera crew,
trying to make a nice video
for some friends of ours
and I don't need this bullshit.
I'll be straight up with ya.
I got a bit of a drinking problem.
Yeah, exactly.
Check them. They got stuff too.
It's probably better
if you guys leave.
We gotta go anyway and if that's
okay, we going to take off.
- Leave me alone, you dicks.
- Officer, can you take care of my
hatch there, please.
- Yeah, sure.
- Popped open.
Thanks a lot, officer.
These guys are harassing me.
Hey, I got a knock-knock joke for you.
Knock-knock.
Who's there, dick?
A fucking drunk idiot that's going to jail.
- Okay, guys. Let's go.
- C'mon, guys. Move on.
Search them before they leave.
Fucking asshole. You're fucking dead!
- Get out of here!
- Stay away from me!
Pay attention here. What
do you got going on here?
- Just having a few drinks and walking my dog.
- In the middle of the afternoon?
Yeah.
That's what I do, guys.
We're going to take you downtown
and you're going to cool off.
Take me downtown?
We're going to talk about this downtown.
Why?
I mean, I've got a little bit of history
of drinking in a public place.
Are you walking or drinking?
What are you doing here?
I'm walking.
- I was having a couple drinks.
- You're embarassing yourself in front of your neighbours.
I was doing nothing until
those two dickheads came up.
- Friggin' trying to shoot him and you're doing nothing.
- Mr. Lewis, this happens every week.
We're going to take you downtown
and we're going to talk it out.
- Give me this. Hey!
- No!
Give me him back.
Take him.
I got him.
Alright.
Cocksuckers.
Let me go.
Calm down! Don't make
this worse for yourself.
- You got him?
- I got him.
Let go.
- Can you grab my cuffs?
- Alright.
Fuck!
- You guys are dicks.
- Shut your mouth!
I'm a taxpayer.
And you're saying, Patrick,
that sound pretty strange.
Why would anyone want to
have your dog killed?
Well, I let him be is natural self.
This is a $600 job.
That's a big job in this business.
One of the biggest.
Normally, it's $150 to $200.
$600 is a lot of money.
All the neighbours chipped in.
This dog is pooping and
peeing on everyone's lawn.
I think there's six or seven neighbours
now that have all chipped in money,
and they want this job done.
Not only has he been fucking
us around for three months,
We're getting calls everyday from these
neighbours saying we paid you the money.
This dog is still pooping
and peeing on our lawn.
Poop is biodegradable.
It goes back into the earth.
Helps things grow.
Farmers let their cows poop
anywhere they want to.
So, I don't see
what's wrong with me
letting my dog go out and
poop wherever he wants to.
It's kinda like playing on a sports team.
He's like the team you can never beat.
So, I bought this.
I got this now.
And I don't want to use it.
But I will,
if I need to protect my dog and myself.
I will use it.
Fuck!
I'm fucking tired of this shit, man.
I can't do this anymore.
That was good fucking ice cream, man.
No, pick that up.
- What?
- Pick that up.
- I'm just putting it there for now.
- Don't throw things around in my car.
Put it in your pocket.
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is wrong with you today, huh?
I leave my house in the middle of a
heated discussion with my fucking fiancee.
Have to leave my kid there again
I told her I'd be gone
for two or three hours.
We both know that's fucking a load of shit.
I'm going to gone all fucking
day and night as usual.
And now I got to put with you
in a fucking bitchy mood.
I'm tired of it.
Why are you bitchy again today?
Do some fucking coke
or something, please.
Fuck!
Tell you what you need
is a fucking cigarette.
Here.
Maybe you'll stop being so
fucking cranky, Mr. Quitter.
Light it up for me.
I just got a few things I got to deal with.
Okay, Ricky? They're kind of personal
and I don't want to get into it right now.
Are you thinking about that little psychic?
Man, that's a load of shit.
I'm not saying I don't believe in psychic
cause I fucking believe in them.
But a phone psychic?
That's fucking stupid.
If you actually went to a
shop and you paid your $50
and you sat down, they
pulled out the deck of cards
and they tell you some shit,
then that's different.
But a phone psychic, come on!
My god, man.
What's wrong with you?
Why would someone tell another person
that they're going to die in five days?
Now, the call cost me $150 all together.
To me that is a good psychic.
No, to me that's someone who keeps you on the
phone to fucking take your money from you.
He wasn't keeping me on the phone.
- You're stupid.
- I was the one talking to him.
Whatever.
All I'm saying if it is true,
then I got some things I
got to deal with, alright?
- Well...
- And you're not helping me out any.
Can I have your car if you
die in a couple of days?
Don't even start thinking
about shit like that.
If you're going to die, you're
not going to need your car.
Give it to me.
And that's all you want, is my car.
I'm just trying to make a point
that you're fucking stupid
if you listen to a psychic on
the god damned phone for $150.
- If I die, you want my car?
- I'm just making a point here.
- I'm making a fucking point.
- You're not making a point.
You know what?
Don't you have any sensitivity
in you at all, man?
Listen, I love you like a
fucking brother, alright?
- Don't get into this love shit, man.
- I fucking love you like a brother.
- I'm not saying I love you,
- Don't get into this.
but I love you like a fucking brother
and I don't want to see you die.
A fucking phone psychic told
you you were going to die.
That doesn't mean shit!
That does not mean shit!
My wish is that if something
does happen to me,
maybe you guys can take this film
and show it at high schools or something.
You know, teach people a lesson.
You know, this is real.
My life is real.
I still like coming down
here and hanging out.
I mean, this is where I grew up.
This is my roots but,
it ain't the same. That's for damn sure.
I've been gone friggin' two years
and everything's gone to hell.
Hey, Ravine!
Do I look like fucking Ravine?
Come on down here you little bastard.
I'll fucking Ravine ya.
Apparently people think I look
like this man they called Ravine.
I don't even know who the fuck Ravine is.
Apparently he's this ventriloquist
or psychic or some guy,
and I look like him.
Which is kinda cool. People think
I look like a famous person.
And that's kinda neat, I guess but,
I don't like all these little fuckers
running around calling me Ravine.
Ravine.
I call him Ravine too but he calls me dick.
So I'm justified, know what I'm saying?
- I'd rather be called a dick than Ravine.
- Me too, man.
Not hypnotic that's for sure.
Hey, look everybody. It's fucking Ravine!
Fuck!
What is this Ravine shit, man?
I'm losing it.
Don't worry.
- Ricky, keep calm.
- Ravine lives! It's fucking Ravine!
- Keep calm.
- It's fucking Ravine!
Shut up!
- Stop fucking calling me Ravine!
- Ricky.
Ricky!
He's was 15 years old when he started
growing side burns and shit.
Everyone was calling him Ravine because
he tried to grow this thing here.
He looks like the Wolverine.
He looks like the comic book hero.
He's like Ravine and Wolfman Jack.
He's like the same guy.
Even the kids here call
him Ravine and shit.
I mean that's how bad it its.
I understand you're going
to get bitter and shit but
take it on the kids. Not us.
Ravine,
is not a bad guy, alright?
Don't worry about it.
He's most likely your father, dipshit!
Hey, Ravine!
- Don't fucking! Ricky, get the fuck in here!
- I'm getting the fuck out of here!
- Close the fucking door!
- I'm dealing with this, man!
Close the door!
Close the door!
- Close the fucking door!
- You fucking assholes!
Ricky, shut up!
- Alright.
- Fuck!
This is a little test, alright?
- Well, I failed.
- You ready?
Are you ready?
- You wanna pass this test?
- I'm ready to kill those little fuckers.
See, this is the problem at home.
It has nothing to do with me.
You got a lot of anger
built up inside of you.
Hey, Patrick Swayze!
- See, how does that feel?
- Alright.
How the fuck does that feel?
Yeah, that's a bad one.
- Don't worry about it.
- It's Patrick Swayze and Ravine!
- Did they just call me Patrick Swayze?
- Yeah, they did.
It's fucking Patrick Swayze and Ravine!
You little fuckers!
Hey, dirty dancing!
- Oh, man.
- Alright.
- Okay, alright.
- Yeah.
Got him around my leg.
He's fucking me around.
Five shots that little fucker took.
Hey, man. What's up.
What time is it?
Come on in.
Don't worry about the camera, boys.
Come on in, I'l pay you for it.
'Sup, dude.
'Sup.
So, you guys are looking for something.
Hello.
- Yeah, we just heading out to a party.
- Hey, baby.
No, I told you. I'm not
doing that shit tonight.
I had a couple drinks.
That's it.
No, I'm coming over. Already called a cab.
Yeah, it's on its way.
Yes, I know that. Players Light and milk.
Yep, I'll be out--
Bitch.
What do you guys keep forgetting
everytime you come over here?
The time.
- The time. It's nine o'clock.
- No.
Money.
I've been trying to phone you...
Shut up!
- Trevor!
- If you answered your phone when I called.
Trevor! Shut up!
So, this is the deal boys.
Car washed, lawn mowed. Tomorrow.
Sure.
Help yourself.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thanks, man.
I think your cab's here.
What time are you picking me up tomorrow?
First thing.
Be ready.
Two smokes.
Peace, boys.
Peace.
Fucking dick.
The perfect example of
Rick and how uncool he is.
You talk about Halen,
and he's like "I like the new Halen."
"I like Sammy. I like the ballads."
I don't think he's ever heard Eruption.
I don't think he's heard the
first four Van Halen records.
I'm just not down with a
guy that's like that.
You gotta like them when they
were good with David Lee Roth.
You guys want a drink?
- Sure.
- Yeah.
They think it's cool or something.
I don't know. They're alcoholics.
They're always drunk and driving.
It's all they do is sit and drink.
- It's true.
- It's all they do.
Attitudes.
Everybody around here has an attitude.
Go outside the park, people
looking at me, staring at me,
seeing me drinking.
You know? It's my problem.
I'll deal with it.
And I don't find it is a problem,
so it's not a problem.
Okay. Don't look at me.
They're always doing shitty
things to us in the park.
Hanging me off door knobs, giving
me wedgies, chocolate swirlies
and sticking my
head in the toilet.
It wasn't even funny.
It's just ridiculous.
They've always been like that.
And I mean they were losers.
They had kids half their size punching them
in the face, knocking their teeth out.
Kids were selling their teeth in the park.
That's the way they are though.
Sammy Hagar is not David Lee Roth.
I love David Lee Roth.
I can't get enough of that guy.
The old Van Halen, that's
the stuff that rocks.
When they were dragging around
chit around on the road with them,
in the trailers, setting up the
stage show, blowing up a car too.
Shut up, Trevor.
I have a story for you.
It's about a five year old boy,
who had a puppy dog.
His dad comes home drunk one night,
slips in some dog pee,
cracks his head on a table.
Goes into the bedroom and
takes out his revolver.
Puts it in the boys hand.
Made him shoot him.
The way it goes.
You guys want a drink?
Actually, I think we're going to split.
Yeah, man.
No.
Do you want a drink?
Yeah, sure.
Let's go buddy. Help me up, man.
I want you to help me up.
Come here.
I can't play.
I'm done.
You know what, Caes?
Yeah, I know.
We're going to come out here again,
tomorrow night.
We're gonna drink,
and play catch.
And there's nothing
wrong with that, Caes.
Anyone that doesn't like that,
they can fuck right off!
Trevor.
Get up.
Corey.
Get up, man.
Guys got to get out of here.
Get up!
Hey! Get up!
You fucking dicks.
Going to take a shower.
You guys better be out of here.
I just want this on film.
Lucy, this is my last day
of doing this stuff.
I promise you that I won't be going
out with Julian anymore working.
I start a new job on
Monday in contruction.
Okay?
I'm going to be with you and Trinity.
That's all I want.
- You know that's all I want.
- Yeah.
Things are going to better
now, I promise you that.
Will you please shut the
fuck up for one minute here?!
Jesus Christ!
Anyway, like I said. One
more day and that's it.
It's going to bring
home enough money
to keep us going until we
get things rolling here.
Alright, baby?
- Okay.
- I love you.
I'll be back in a few hours.
Ready?
Bye, honey.
- See ya, baby.
- I love you.
Bye, baby!
Came to a decision last night.
I talked it over with Lucy and
this is my last day, basically.
I'm going to do this one last job
because Julian does need my help on it.
But after today, that's it.
I'm done. Not going to be drinking anymore.
I'm not going to do
cocaine ever again and
that's it for me.
I'm going to find a
legitimate job somewhere.
Ricky did the right thing.
He got us this place.
But he's still hanging out with Julian.
I do really like the guy.
He's a great guy.
He is kind of an asshole, I guess.
Lucy thinks he's an asshole and a drug
addict and a drunk and all that stuff.
Despite all that stuff, one thing
I'll say about him is that
he's got a mind that is clear.
It works really good.
Sometimes I get all messed up and stuff and
people are giving me lists or instructions.
It doesn't really make
sense or whatever.
But he's just got this way.
He looks at it in a
different way than I do.
When he tells it to me,
everything is clear.
It makes a lot more sense.
You know, people can learn from me.
All I know is that if I
go back to jail again,
I think Lucy is going to fucking
leave me and that's fucked.
Me and Ricky and Trinity
have a good thing here.
I am not going to lose
another fucking child
and another fucking woman because
of cocaine and killing dogs.
That is fucking bullshit.
Hey, that's fine but it has
nothing to do with me.
It is and today is my last day.
Good.
- Good.
- I'm fucking done.
- No more coke, no more killing animals.
- You think I need you?
- You think I need you?
- I think you do need me.
Because you don't even kill
cats and dogs anymore.
I fucking shot the last ten dogs
and and the last three cats.
You haven't fucking fired a gun.
That's fucking bullshit
and you're getting soft.
That's what I think.
You're fucking scared and
you're getting soft.
Don't call me scared.
Don't call me scared.
Let's see you fucking shoot
something then, huh?
You wanna see me shoot something?
Alright.
Patrick Lewis.
You wanna see me kill his dog?
Considering this is my last job,
it would be nice to finish
of my fucking career
with you killing the fucking dog
for a change, like old times.
Why don't you fucking go
through it, you pussy?
There's nothing coming.
Oh, for fuck sakes.
What!
Why is everyone fucking with me today?
- You little fucker.
- You fucking asshole.
Oh, fuck.
What a fucking asshole.
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Problem here, guys?
You got a fucking problem with us?
You got a problem with fucking Ravine?
Fuck you!
You fucking cocksucker.
Fucking. Ah, man.
This fucking asshole.
- I just don't understand.
- It's pretty whack.
Oh, my fuck. Look who it is.
- That's him right over there.
- Is that him?
Put your gun away.
There's people everywhere.
- Put your fucking gun away.
- I'm taking him out.
I'm serious. Do you want to get arrested?
- You guys leave me alone!
- Release the dog!
- Leave him there. Walk away from the dog.
- Leave the dog asshole!
Leave us alone!
Release the dog!
Release him!
- I got this!
- Put the fucking gun down!
- Put it down!
- Put it down!
Put the fucking gun down!
Put your gun down, man.
Where is he?
I don't fucking know. I know
he's fucking tired somewhere.
Do you want to go or
do you want me to go?
I'm fucking going cover me.
Fuck!
You alright?
I'm fucking shot!
Fuck!
Where you hit?
- He fucking shot me!
- Put the gun down.
Somebody's hurt here.
You fucking asshole! You shot me!
Cocksuckers!
Fuck you!
I gotta go to the hospital, man.
$600, Ricky. I'm going to get him.
Get the fuck outta here!
Go! Go!
Come on out!
Come on out!
Fuck!
It didn't have to go this way.
Get outta here!
Give me the dog, asshole!
Fuck, Caes!
Sorry, buddy.
Julian, I need some help man.
I'm fucked up over here.
You fucking dick, you
fucking shot me!
I can't fucking do it!
Shoot the fucking dog!
Fuck!
What in the Fuck!
Jesus Christ! I've been fucking shot!
Fuck!
I'm fucking dying, man.
Fucking shot me.
Now we're fucked.
Down! Down!
Shut the fuck up!
Clear!
This is fucked up!
I've been fucking shot!
I'm fucking shot too!
Fuck you guys!
Fucking stupid!
For fuck sakes!
You fucking dicks!
Fuck you!
Ah! Fuck!
- Fuck you, Ricky!
- No, fuck you!
So, I'm in jail.
Been here for two and half years.
I can handle it.
It's not that tough.
But,
I thought I should finish off my
documentary with me being in jail.
Let people know that this
is what happens to you.
If you take the path that
I've taken in my life.
First thing I'm going to say is I'm
really glad Julian did this documentary.
He got this out to the
public for people to see
because I think that's important.
People can learn from this.
They played this in the court
room was our downfall.
If it hadn't been for this documentary,
we would have gotten a year or two.
And that's unfortunate.
It kinda pisses me
off to be honest.
No offense to you guys.
I can't fucking wait to drink.
Through counselling
I was told there was nothing
really wrong with me.
Counsellor says I have
a definite problem.
Says that I use alchohol as a vent.
A way that I lose myself.
Well, you know what?
I think the counsellor's right.
Basically, if it wasn't for Julian,
I wouldn't be here right now.
He's the one who got
me into all this shit.
He was force feeding me cocaine.
My counsellors say the only person
I can really blame is myself.
I also realized that this
whole psychic thing dead,
I thought I was going to die.
And that's what the psychic told me.
But, what I've come
to realize is that,
I'm not really going to die, yet.
My life is just ended for a little while.
It's been put on pause.
Well, I've taken a couple of courses.
I learned how to tint windows for cars.
So I can either start a business
with that or get a job somewhere.
I've only been in prison twice
and that's not that bad.
Most people are in prison
a lot more that that.
I should be able to get a job.
I've got to stay clean.
Cause I don't want to end up back in here.
Even though it's not that bad.
But, it's not good.
Julian feels no remorse whatsoever.
I think if he got out tomorrow,
he'd probably go pick
up a gun somewhere
and start killing dogs and
cats for money again.
I made a lot of mistakes in my life.
And I'm paying the price for it right now.
I'm not upset I'm in jail because
I knew I did a lot of bad things.
I broke the law everyday
and I'm paying for it.
Deep down, I really believe
this is all his fault.
And I will never associate
with Julian again.
I've really got my shit together now.
And I think that I'll be okay.
