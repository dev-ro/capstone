An Ohm s tracks
They' re still fresh
An Ohm s shell
Amazing
I've never seen a perfect shell
Lovely sound
It chipped my ceramic sword
The villagers will be pleased
They' ll have plenty to
make into tools now
Wha t an eye
I wonder if l can carry it
It came free
It' s incredibly light
Mushigo Palm spores
So beautiful. . .
Though in this f orest of death,
your lungs would rot
in 5 minutes without a mask
Who is that?
What can it be?
My heart' s pounding
Those are gunshots
An insect is
a ttacking someone
Oh, I' m sorry !
Over there !
What a thick spore cloud
An Ohm!
That must have been its shell
Don' t run tha t way
Look this way !
They answered !
They' re coming
Who' s that?
Wha t a magnificent Ohm
Go upwind !
Thank you !
Return to the f orest. Ohm
This is not your world
Be a good boy
It' s blinded by rage
I' ve got to calm him
The flares stunned it
An insect charm
Awaken, Ohm
Return to the f orest
It' s awake
The Ohm' s returning to the forest
She tamed that Ohm with
flares and an insect charm
Lord Yupa !
Nausicaa
I hardly recognized you
It' s been a year and half
Fa ther will be glad
I must thank you
You' ve become a grea t wind-rider
Oh. no, not according to f a ther
Oh, of course
I' d compIetely forgotten about him
A fox-squirrel
I' ve never seen one
When a winged insect snatched him,
l took him f or a human child
l had to fire my gun
That' s wha t enraged the Ohm
He' d fainted so was
spared the poison
Better not touch him
Even young. they' re savage
Come
Here
Hey. . .
You' re not scared
You' re not scared
See. . . you' re not scared
See. . .
You were just frightened
Lord Yupa, may I have him?
Why certainly. . .
Thank you
Kai and Kui
Remember me?
A mysterious power
You must be tired
You ran so far
ls everyone well?
What s wrong?
My f a ther. . .
He can no longer fly
Jihl. . .
The forest poisons?
Yes
He says it' s f ate for those
living by the Sea of Decay
I should have come sooner
Oh, no
Thank you f or coming
Lord Yupa, there s something
I want to show you
My secret room
It' s a secret
l don' t want to scare them
I' ll tell them you're coming
Come soon !
Lord Yupa
Would you carry this?
It' s hard to fly with
She certainly reads the wind well
Not far now
Oh. . .
Lord Yupa
Welcome
Are you in good health?
The waters and winds
are clear and calm
Lord Yupa
Hello all, you' re well
Lord Yupa
We' ve missed you
Princess, he has come
Wait
Lord Yupa
Old Mito, you' re hard at work
Tonight l' ll hear
tales of your travels
OK. start it
Seems to work
Yes
This is excellent
Tomorrow, we' ll send
people to get the rest
Come. Toeto
Lord Yupa
This is Toeto' s baby, born this year
Oh. let' s have a look
A fine baby
Reminds me of Nausicaa
as a baby
Please be her godf a ther
Name her tha t a fair wind
may f avor her
l will indeed
l' ll find her a fine name
Thank you
May she grow up
as strong as our Princess
She' s as strong as they come
But we won' t want her
playing in the Sea of Decay
But that' s where
l found the Ohm shell
Put yourself in my shoes
l' m responsible f or this castle
She s made me sick with worry
Let her play in the Sea of Decay
if she finds us Ohm shells
lndeed, her presence
there saved me
Saved by the girl?
This is a fine valley
Being here calms my spirits
How was your journey?
It was terrible
The Sea of Decay consumed
2 more countries to the south
It' s spreading all the time
And yet war and hunger
are everywhere
Nothing but bad omens
Why can' t they live
as you do in this valley?
The ocean winds protect our valley
The Sea of Decay
can' t reach us here
Wha t do you say. Yupa?
lsn' t it time you
settled in this valley?
Look at my condition
It would please everyone
Don' t bother
Yupa' s a man who is f ated
to search forever
Fa te, huh. . .
Obaba, what' s
he searching f or?
Oh, my, don' t you
know. Nausicaa?
Look, see the tapestry on the wall. . .
I no longer see it
The figure in the left corner
''. . . clothed in blue robes,
''descending onto a golden field,
''to join bonds
with the grea t earth
''and guide the people
to the pure land. a t last''
Lord Yupa, l always thought
tha t was only a legend
You mustn' t tease me, Obaba
It' s the same thing
l only wish to solve
the Sea of Decay' s mysteries
Are we humans but a tribe
destined to be swallowed
and ruined by the Sea of Decay?
Tha t is what l wish to know
If only l could help Lord Yupa. . .
Princess, Princess
Wha t is it. Mito?
A strange scent on the wind
It' s nearly dawn
l ll be right there
How is it?
It s one fine storm,
but something' s amiss
Over there !
Look !
It' s a ship
Why would a ship be here?
What is it?
Lord Yupa
It' s a ship
A ship !
It' s coming closer
It' s huge !
It' s a Tolmekian ship
It' s not flying right
It' s an emergency landing
Help me up, Gol
Princess, you mustn' t !
l' ll guide them to the shore
It' s coming about
Off you go !
Teto !
How dare they !
They must have landed before
and killed some insects
Turn away !
You' ll crash!
Turn away !
Turn !
It crashed
The Princess
The cliff s
Let' s go !
Everyone to the rescue
Even the boys !
It' s tha t girl, she' s alive
Where am I. . .
The Valley of the Wind
Save your strength
My name is. . .
Lastel of Pejite
My cargo. . .
Burn the cargo. . .
The cargo. . .
Please, burn it
Your cargo, I understand
Don t worry
It' s all in flames
Thank goodness
Princess !
That' s. . .
The Princess of Pe jite
An insect !
An Ushiabu' s alive
Oh, no, it' s calling its friends
It can' t fly
Bring guns !
No, if you shoot it,
it ll call others
I' ll kill it now
Guns won' t kill an Ushiabu
Then wha t !
Wait
Mito
Bring my glider
Princess !
Return to the f orest
You' re strong, you can fly
That' s a good boy
Princess
Thanks
Thank God
No telling how we' d suff er f or
even a single insect' s dea th
An Ohm. . .
Found one !
Come !
Here !
So those were spores
stuck to tha t ship
They haven' t released
any toxins yet
We' re almost done
l know
We can' t miss a single one
What on earth is this?
The fire didn t destroy it. . .
Leave this mystery
for later, folks
Go and help burn the spores
Be careful. now
Why' d she bring this
bundle of trouble here
Mito, look here
It' s pulsing
Almost like it' s alive
Lord Yupa, what is this. . .
On my journey
l heard ominous rumors. . .
That a monster from the
old world tha t had slept
beneath Pejite,
had been unearthed
A monster from the old world?
Giant Warriors. . .
The Giant Warriors !
They say they were destroyed
in the Seven Days of Fire
This. . .
The Giant Warriors were all
said to have turned to stone
But a single one slept in
the earth for 1, 000 years
ln. . . ln a way, the thing
looks almost human
Tolmekia' s a savage military state,
f ar to our west
And remember the Pe jite
captive who perished. . .
Keep up the good work
What' s tha t?
Tolmekian ships !
Everyone to the castle !
To the castle !
Gather in the castle !
The castle !
Fa ther !
Obaba. hide yourself
l' ll stay right where l am
Princess !
How dare you !
Nausicaa. . .
Stay where you are !
Move and this sword,
carved of insect shell
will pierce your ceramic armor
That' s Yupa. . .
I ask you Tolmekian warriors
Last night, these villagers toiled
despera tely to save one of your ships
We have just now gently
laid one of your dead to rest
ls this how you Tolmekians treat
such a nation. however weak !
lf you would make war,
you must have reasons
You should first send a messenger
to declare them
Nausicaa. . .
Be calm, Nausicaa
lf you fight now,
they will slaughter the villagers
We must survive
Wait for our chance
You. . .
Little wench
Put it down. Kurotowa
But. . .
Look at this mess
Killed them all
Your rebuke stings
Are you Yupamiralda,
the greatest swordsman of this region?
We have not come for slaughter
We wish to talk
Lay down your sword
The Princess !
Princess !
Listen well !
Her Highness Kushana, Division
Commander of the Tolmekian
Frontier Forces will speak
We have come to unif y
the frontier na tions
and build peace in this region
You live on the brink of extinction
beside the Sea of Decay
Accept our rule
and join our enterprise
We shall burn away the Sea of Decay
and resurrect the earth !
Burn away the Sea of Decay
ls tha t possible?
We have revived the
miraculous skills and power
tha t once allowed humans
to rule this earth
For those who submit to us,
l promise a lif e free from f ear of
the toxins and insects of that swamp
Wait !
You must not harm the Sea of Decay
What' s that, you old hag
Take her away
Let her speak
ln the 1, 000 years
of the Sea of Decay,
countless times have humans
sought to burn it away
Yet. . . each time herds
of Ohms, blind with rage,
have swarmed the earth,
like a tidal wave
Destroying nations,
swallowing cities.
the Ohms' rage would not quiet
until they starved to death
ln time, the spores
took root in the Ohms' rotting flesh,
and engulf ed our vast
earth in this Sea of Decay
You must not touch
the Sea of Decay
Enough !
No more of your ravings
Ah ! What will you do?
Kill me. too?
You!
Kill me if you will !
Easy work to murder
an old blind woman
Just as you murdered Jihl
Not Jihl !
How cruel !
He was helpless !
Shut them up !
Show no mercy to impudence !
Wait, everyone !
Please listen to me
l don' t want anymore sacrifices
Please
Princess. . .
You, too, Obaba
We must submit to these people
Step on it
Hurry up
It really is a lovely valley
I' m against it
We have orders to send the
Giant Warrior back a t once
An order we can t possibly fulfill
Even our biggest ship
collapsed from its weight
But you can' t be serious
about building a na tion here. . .
And what if l am?
You expect me to hand over that
monster as a toy f or those fools?
You have a point. . .
I am but a simple soldier
Such a decision is beyond my position
You' re a sly f ox
While l' m in Pejite, your priority
is to revive tha t Giant Warrior
Yes
Can this gun ship fly?
Yes, we found it here
Get this straight
l' m not asking you
But take the Princess to Pe jite. . . .
5 hostages, the gun ship and food. . .
You pick the hostages
Prepare everything
for the morning
Thanks for going as a hostage
We' re fine, but look
They' re taking everything in sight
l will slip away, return in secret
and await my chance
We must prevent that
monster' s resurrection
Yes
Nausicaa
Teto, where is she?
Nausicaa ! What on earth is this?
These plants are from
the Sea of Decay
l' ve grown them
from spores l collected
Don' t worry. they' re not toxic
Not toxic. . .
The air here is pure indeed, but. . .
Why. . . with this deadly poisonous
plant blooming
The castle windmill draws
wa ter from deep within the earth
The sand, too, comes from
the very bottom of the well
With pure water and soil,
the plants from the Sea of Decay
are not poisonous
The pollution lies in the earth itself
Even the earth of our valley
Why. . .
Who made such a
terrible mess of the world?
Did you do this all yourself?
Yes
To cure my father' s illness
and tha t of others
But. . .
l' m closing it down
l just shut off the wa ter and
they' ll soon wither and die
Nausicaa
I frighten myself
l don' t know wha t my rage
will make me do
I don' t want to kill anyone
Princess
We gathered these f or you
Chiko nuts
They' re for you
All of you. . .
So many
You' ve worked so hard
Thank you
They' re very precious
It' s not fair, Princess
All aboard !
We' re taking of f
There. now
You mustn' t cry
Don t worry
I' ll be home in no time
Really?
Why, have l ever lied to you?
No
Right?
Yeah
Promise?
Yes
Go along, it' s dangerous
OK
You promised !
Take care of the Princess !
Aren' t we in Pe jite yet?
My back is killing me
Boy oh boy, did the Princess
ever pick a bunch of losers
Hey, isn' t this strange?
Why do they fly so close together?
Like they' re a fraid of an attack
Toxins swirl below the clouds
Don' t move
A gun ship !
Enemy fire !
They' ve hit ship #2 !
I told you so
Wow, terrifying !
Defense forma tion !
That' s a Pejite gun ship
Pe jite !
Damn ! They got #3
What' s the Korvet doing?
Their ships just crumble
Oh no, he' s hit our tail
The Barge tether snapped
Hurry, Teto
Oh, no, we' re going down
Princess !
Stop ! No more killing !
No more !
Princess
Hurry, Mito !
Princess, we' re doomed
Maybe I can fly it
Are you crazy !
Hurry, Mito !
Wha t? Right !
Start the engine !
Blast open the door !
Come !
Hurry
Get inside
Mito, ready?
Ready or not !
Full throttle when we take of f !
Roger !
Ready
Go !
Put on the toxin mask
Drop below the clouds
to find the Barge
You' re still warm
Don' t give up, Teto
Wha t is this place !
l ve never seen
such dense toxins
Keep an eye on the right tail
It' s nearby
It' s still alof t
Hey ! You' re right !
There it is !
It' s the Princess !
Princess !
Don' t give up, everyone
l' ll throw you a rope
Our hook' s broken
You can' t hook us in mid-air
l don t want to crash and
become insect food !
We' ll leap to our dea ths !
Don' t panic !
Ditch your cargo
Good bye
Farewell !
Listen to me !
Toss your cargo !
Kill the rear engine
Wha t?
The engine noise is too loud
Hurry !
Yes !
Wha t?
Princess. . .
Wha t are you. . .
Your mask, Princess !
You' ll die !
Put your mask on !
l promise you' ll be sa f e
Trust me and dump tha t cargo
We' ll do wha tever you say
Please ! Put your mask back on !
The Princess is smiling
We re going to be OK
Hurry ! Lose the cargo
Princess, we' re in a nose-dive !
Re-start engines !
I inhaled
Hurry, hurry
Princess !
Everyone sa fe?
Don' t move !
You!
Thanks f or saving me
Why' d you save her, Princess?
You' re a fool
You thought l' d grovel
in gratitude?
You know nothing of the Sea of Decay
It isn' t like the human world
There' s no knowing what
a single gunshot will bring
Tha t battle hurled
ships into this f orest
The insects are furious
Look up
The Yamma are sentries
They' ll quickly bring other insects
We must escape now
Throw me your extra rope
Mito, fix the hook
Don' t move
I give the orders
Wha t are you so a fraid of?
You' re just like
a lost f ox-squirrel
How dare you !
Don' t be a fraid
We just want you to go back
to your own country
You. . .
They' re here !
Quiet ! Don' t anger them
This is an Ohm' s nest !
We' re surrounded
They' re examining us
Forgive us. Ohm,
for disturbing your nest
Please understand,
we' re not your enemies
Princess !
He s still alive
Wait, Ohm !
What' s happening?
Their eyes have turned blood-red
What will you do with the glider?
When the waters quiet,
take of f and wait f or me above
lf l' m not back in 1 hour,
return to the valley
But. . .
Princess !
She' s gone
Hand it over
All right, everyone
We' ll do as the Princess said
Princess. . .
Damn !
Who are you?
You think only of killing
My flares and charms
won' t help now
It' s quicksand !
Damn !
It' s been 2 hours already
More and more insects
Princess !
Princess !
Nausicaa
Nausicaa
Come here
Come here
Fa ther
Mother' s here. too
No, I don' t want to go
Stay away !
There' s nothing here
l said, there' s nothing !
Stay inside
It' s a baby Ohm
She' s being used by the insects
Give it to me, Nausicaa
No ! It' s not doing anything bad
lnsects and humans can' t
live in the same world
Please, don' t kill it !
Please !
Teto. . .
Wha t a strange place
Hey !
l finally found it
How are you f eeling?
Where are we?
First, let me thank you
l' m Asbel of Pejite
Thank you for saving me
l' m Nausicaa of
the Valley of the Wind
Where are we?
No wonder you' re surprised
We' re beneath the Sea of Decay
Beneath the Sea of Decay?
Look, we fell from up there.
along with the sand
We' re not wearing masks
That' s right
The air here is pure
Couldn' t believe it myself,
finding this place
under the Sea of Decay
What is it?
Nausicaa, don' t wander too f ar
What a wonderful tree
Even though it' s dead,
wa ter still flows through it
Just like the sand
at the bottom of our well
Grains of petrified wood
sifting down from above
Nausicaa
Are you crying?
Yes
I' m so happy
Lastel was my twin sister
I should have been with her
l' m sorry l didn' t
tell you sooner
Oh, no. . .
l' m sorry
l nearly killed the person
who eased my sister' s pain
l see. . .
So it' s in the Valley of the Wind
This nut tastes really weird
It' s a chiko nut
It' s really good f or you
It doesn' t taste grea t,
but l could ea t a whole boot-full !
Why the Sea of Decay was born. . .
You think the strangest thoughts
The trees of the Sea of Decay
grew to cleanse
a world polluted by humans
They absorb toxins from the earth,
genera te pure crystals,
die and turn to sand
That' s what created
these underground caverns
The insects protect this f orest
ln tha t case, we' re doomed
We can' t possibly survive,
living in terror of toxins and insects
f or thousands of years
At least we can find a way
to keep it from spreading
You sound just I ike Kushana
No ! We don' t plan to use
the Giant Warriors !
You' ll see when you
meet my friends tomorrow
Let' s go to sleep
We have far to go tomorrow
All' s well
On schedule?
The torso is solidif ying well
You' re one cute monster
Makes a poor soldier think
of dusting of f old ambitions
It s grinning
You should' ve slept beneath
the earth til the end of time
Counselor !
Her Highness' planes were
a ttacked by Pejite survivors
All crashed, except the Korvet
Wha t about Her Highness?
Her ship exploded in flight
Counselor
- The villagers don' t know yet?
- No
OK, we'll head out
You stay here and keep working
Either f ortune' s finally smiling
on this lowly soldier. . .
Or it s a trap set to destroy me. . .
Mito and the others have returned,
waiting a t Acid Lake, Lord Yupa
In shame we return without her
No, no, l' m pleased you' re sa fe
Releasing me?
Drown the Giant Warrior
deep in Acid Lake,
and return to your country. . .
Few of your soldiers remain here
We could easily start a fight,
but why sacrifice more people?
Fire and wa ter are powerless against it,
and it' s only a matter of time
before it starts to walk
Don' t you see?
It' s far too la te to turn back
My orders to invade Pe jite
were motivated by fear
that another country had
harnessed its strength
Once its presence here is known,
the great powers will
send their armies
You have but one choice left
Revive the Giant Warrior,
defy both grea t powers
and learn to live with that thing
Look
An insect did tha t. . . ?
Whoever becomes my husband
will see worse than that
Burn the Sea of Decay,
kill the insects,
and restore the human world
Why do you hesitate !
Steal it from us, just as
we stole it from Pejite
We shall not give
the Giant Warrior life
Emergency !
What' s the password?
I' m in a hurry !
Wind
Valley !
OK
Some spores survived !
Wha t !
They' re spreading toxins
and the valley' s going crazy !
Hand 'em over
Hurry up !
Hurry, or the valley' s doomed
We need our tools back
The tools tha t burn spores
can also be used as weapons
We have no choice
Release everything but their guns
The Korvet' s taking of f
Get through this time
Summon all our troops
from Pejite to this valley
Good grief, now
this is a real mess
Hurry
Hurry
Find the Princess
Look a fter the valley
Be careful until we return
We' re going to the valley
It' s no use, the spores
are already here
And on this side, too
Move !
What are you doing !
Oh, no, here, too
Obaba
We' ve no choice but to burn it
This forest is doomed
lf we hesita te, the Sea of Decay
will consume our valley
lsn' t there anything to be done?
This f orest guarded
the reservoir for 3 centuries
Damn ! lf only they' d never come
This is getting out of hand
Let' s go help them
You think so?
l think it looks the same as ever
The insects have gone
l wonder why my heart' s
pounding so hard
We' re almost there
My friends are just
over that mountain
Pe jite looks strange
Wha t is tha t haze?
Asbel, your mask
Insects ! All dead
Head f or Pejite
Be careful, the Tolmekian
army must be there
Even an Ohm. . .
It attacked the Great Dome
Pe jite' s finished
They wiped out the Tolmekians,
but this is. . .
They wiped out?
Wha t do you mean. Asbel?
It' s a Brig
My friends' ship !
They re landing, let' s go !
Asbel !
You' re alive !
Wha t have you done?
We can' t rebuild it
You' ve seen the city
Don' t worry, if the Sea of Decay
swallows it, we' ll burn it away
But the Giant Warrior isn' t here
I know, it' s in the Valley of the Wind
How did. . .
We haven' t exactly been idle
We' ve launched our 2nd phase
We' ll wipe out the Tolmekians
in the valley tonight
Wha t !
What are you going to do?
Who' s this, Asbel?
Nausicaa from
the Valley of the Wind
l owe her my lif e
Valley of the Wind. . .
Tell me. wha t will happen?
You must know, Asbel !
Tell me
They' ll provoke an insect a ttack
So you made them
a ttack Pejite, too !
You' re. . . horrible. . .
We simply have to recover the
Giant Warrior before they revive it
We' re doing it to save the world
And so you' ll murder
everyone in the Valley !
Stop it ! Call it of f ! Please !
It' s too late
Once they ve started,
no one can stop them
We' ve lost most of our
people to the Tolmekians
This is the only way
Let go ! Let me fly !
It' s horrible now, but the Giant
Warrior will purge the Sea of Decay
and rebuild the human world
Liar ! You' re just like the Tolmekians
No, they want to use it for destruction
You drink wa ter from the wells, too
Do you know what purifies tha t water?
The trees in the Sea of Decay
cleanse all the lakes
and rivers tha t humans polluted !
And you want to destroy tha t !
Why did you dig up
that Giant Warrior !
What choice do we have?
Subject ourselves to Tolmekian rule?
Never, never !
Tell them, Asbel, how
the Sea of Decay came to be
How the insects protect this world!
Please, Asbel!
What are you doing !
Don' t move !
Release her
Calm down, Asbel
l m serious
Release her
Nausicaa, go and warn them !
Asbel
Let me go !
Fools
No stopping fighting once it starts
But he warned us to be careful. . .
Quit dawdling and use the tanks
to rescue our men
Counselor ! They got the last man !
Coming our way?
I don' t know
The whole village is gathering
Why do they go berserk
over a little f orest or two?
Just as it was with Pe jite
They got our tank !
Hurry. get it moving
Don' t panic
lncoming fire !
Forward !
Hurry up !
Maybe this is it?
It' s moving !
Which way?
Forward, move f orward
l know tha t
Damn ! Mobilize all the tanks
She survived. . .
So much for my dreams. . .
Your Highness !
We' ll hold 'em off here
Lead everyone to saf ety
by Acid Lake
All right
It s just until the Princess
returns with the gun ship
Hurry everyone !
Stop gawking and help me
My aching back
The tanks are coming !
Hurry !
l know tha t
Are you sure?
It s a Pejite Brig
I saw it peeking through the clouds
OK !
Wa tch out, she' s a wild one
Quickly
Nausicaa, you may go free
Go warn your Valley
Your glider may get you
there in time
It' s waiting
Asbel told me everything
l' ll take your place
Put this on
You' re. . .
Lastel' s mother
Thank you
I' m so very sorry
Everything we' ve done is wrong
Hurry !
Wha t about her?
She' ll be all right. don t worry
Be careful
We' ve treated you so badly
Over here, Nausicaa
Hurry
Thank you, everyone !
Sorry it took so long
Can you launch from here?
l' ll try
A Korvet !
Take cover in the clouds !
Stop firing !
ldiots ! Nothing but wind
and lightning in there
It' s useless ! l' ve lost control !
The ship is breaking apart
We have to leave
the clouds and fight
They were expecting us
Wha t are they up to?
Forcing us into the clouds
so they can board us
Here they come
This is your last chance
No, l ll stay with you
l can' t abandon all those people
and the girl who took my place
Only you can save your people
Please, go, f or our sakes !
The ship is ours
Take no prisoners
Destroy them
Go. Nausicaa !
Asbel !
Princess !
Mito !
Mito ! Lord Yupa !
Princess
Hurry, everyone' s in. . . !
l' ll engage the hook now
Lord Yupa, tha t red lever !
This is their last stronghold
The door won' t hold
Any time
Show them some Pe jite pride
What is that?
A bird?
A ship, a gun ship from the Valley
Wha t !
You. . .
It' s Lord Yupa, here' s
a chance f or glory !
Surrender, your Korvet
won' t be back
This guy s tough
Princess, you' re crazy
The engine' ll blow
Just make it to the Valley
Speed up !
Dear God. God of the Wind
Please protect my people
They won' t budge
They' re waiting f or her return
Return?
They believe tha t girl will
return with their gun ship
Tha t gun ship' s a pain
It' s our chance to a ttack
Do you know what tha t ship is?
It' s from bef ore
the Seven Days of Fire
The one they say
went as f ar as the stars. . .
It' s too strong for our guns,
but bury it in a hole. . .
I, too, wish to wait
lf she really does return from
deep in the Sea of Decay. . .
l' d like a chance
to really talk to her
Made up your minds?
lf you' ll aid our attack,
I' ll let you go
You want to end up like Pe jite?
You' re a Princess, too
You' re nothing like our Princess
Look at my hand
That s wha t King Jihl had
ln 6 more months
it will be stone
But our Princess said,
she liked these hands
They were the beautiful hands
of a hard worker
You want to live
with the Sea of Decay
even as its toxins ravage you?
You use fire
We use it a bit, too
Too much fire
and nothing will grow
Fire can turn the f orest
into ashes in a single day
Water and wind sustain
a f orest f or 100 years
We like the water and the wind
The sight of our f orest
will grieve the Princess
Counselor, we await your orders
Shut up
Yes sir
Who knows what happened,
but she sure looks cute
Let them go, Kurotowa !
Huh? You want to wait?
Feed the soldiers
We attack in 1 hour
Food, huh?
Finally. a real meal
Someone' s coming !
It' s Gol and the others
What is it?
There' s no wind
No wind?
You' re right, the wind s stopped
Obaba, wha t is it?
Obaba
Someone. . .
Someone take me outside. . .
The wind' s never stopped before
Obaba, my ears hurt
The air. . .
The very air is thick with rage
We' re close !
We' re clear of the Sea of Decay !
3 minutes to Acid Lake !
ldle the engines
Drop benea th the clouds
What' s this glow !
Ohms !
The Sea of Decay is spreading
They' re headed f or the Valley
How did they stampede the Ohms. . .
Someone s baiting them
Mito ! Turn towards Sirius
Yes !
It' s there
Mito, a flare !
Ready
Fire !
What is that?
How cruel. . .
They' re baiting them
with a baby
I' ll shoot 'em down!
No, Mito !
Don' t shoot !
Why not ! Why shouldn' t l?
Kill the baby,
and the stampede will never end !
Wha t can we do !
They ll destroy the Valley
Calm down, Mito
Return the baby to them
Let' s try
Wha t are you doing, Princess !
You go ahead and warn them
Princess !
You' re not even armed
That' s not one of our flares
How f ar?
20 leagues
The other side of the lake
ls it a gun ship?
Probably
That' s a distress signal
It' s definitely the gun ship
It' s been an hour, let' s go
Why not wait?
The bloodshed is inevitable
Infantry advance
Your Highness, get inside
I' m fine here
The gun ship !
Fire !
Hold your fire !
Stop it ! Stop !
Princess !
Stand-by
Don' t fire
Your Highness
Where' s the girl !
The Princess !
She' s not here
The Ohm, a stampede
It' s coming this way
Wha t !
The Ohm!
The Princess stayed behind
to stop them
This is no time for battle
Everyone run, find the
highest place you can ! Now !
Obaba, l see a red glow
It' s spreading
It' s coming this way
You hold on tight
There' s no stopping them now
Don' t panic
There' s still time
lf l have to die,
I want to die in the Valley
No, you mustn' t give up,
not while the Princess has faith
Listen, hold them of f
as long as you can
I' ll return soon
Your Highness. not that. . .
It' s not ready yet !
lf not now, when !
Go !
Don' t shoot ! Listen to me !
Damn! She flies like a bird
She' s not an enemy
She wants to say something
Anyone who interf eres is an enemy
We' d better drop the bait in
the Valley soon. or die ourselves
Here she comes !
Let her come in close, then fire
Now ! Fire !
No !
That' s Lastel !
Move !
Ohm. . .
Don' t be angry
Don' t be frightened
l' m not your f oe
l' m sorry
l' m sorry
I can' t ask your forgiveness
It' s too cruel
Don' t move !
You' ll bleed to dea th
Be good, little one, keep still
They' ve f ound us
They' re coming
Stop ! Not with those wounds !
The lake is poison. . .
You. . .
Good baby
l' m fine
They re coming for you
They' re turning away
Ohm ! Don' t !
The Valley' s that way
They' ve forgotten us in their rage
If l don' t calm them, the Valley. . .
Fools ! Drawing them
with their own fire
We' re sa fe
We' d better get away
Check the engine
No. no !
We can discuss this
Take us to them
l must give them the baby
What' s the point. it' s too la te
They' ll never stop
Drop us in front of them, then
Take us
But you' ll die. too
Obaba, will we all die?
lf that' s our f ate,
we must accept it
They don t even waver
Let' s retreat
Idiot ! There' s nowhere to go
Don' t retreat !
Hold your ground
f or Her Highness
Highness. . .
Your Highness !
Get them !
The Giant Warrior. . .
Giant Warrior
It' s rotting
It' s too soon
Burn them !
What' s wrong
Are you not descended from
Earth' s most evil tribe !
lncredible. . .
No wonder the world caught fire
Your Highness Kushana, hurray !
Destroy them !
What' s wrong with you?
Hurry up and fire !
We' re done for
The Giant Warrior is dead
It' s for the best
The Ohm' s rage is
the fury of the Earth itself
There' s no reason to live
if our lives depend on a monster
Princess !
The Princess !
Not there
It' s madness
Princess !
The Ohms are changing color
Their rage has vanished
They stopped
The Ohms stopped
Princess !
The Princess is dead
She calmed them
with her own lif e
She saved our Valley
Look. . .
Wha t is tha t light?
Teto. . .
Wonderful
Thank you. Ohm
Thank you
It' s a miracle
A miracle
Such friendship and sympa thy
The Ohms have opened their hearts
Children, watch well and tell me

The Princess is wearing
strange blue clothes
It' s like she' s walking
through golden fields
''. . . clothed in blue robes.
''descending onto a golden field. . . ''
Obaba. . .
The ancient legend was true
Look !
The glider
The wind !
The wind has returned
