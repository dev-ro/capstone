This painting of St. Sebastian...
...is in effect...
...a Hellenistic statue set against a
magnificent Renaissance background.
His martyrdom and suffering
leaves us relatively unmoved.
Notice how Perugino,
that Umbrian peasant...
...could transform the local rustics
into saints and madonnas.
And see how he rendered
this tragedy of pain...
...and suffering with
serene detachment.
Perugino was reluctant to paint blood...
...as his tears are like drops
of dew fallen from the sky.
His scenes rarely exude
an air of drama.
This is true of his St. Sebastian in
Stockholm and the one in the Louvre.
Everything is bathed in an elegance
approaching the supernatural.
Here, the figure transcends
all human experience.
In a very personal way...
...Perugino had absorbed the lesson
of the great Piero Della Francesca...
...only to decline in his later years...
...into a sort of...
...convoluted and provincial
formalism that decidedly...
...undermines the power and
originality of his earlier work.
That is all for today.
- Do you need any more pictures?
- That's enough.
All right, cover the body.
- Is the attorney coming?
- Yes, we informed him.
Haven't you seen this car before?
I wasn't here, you know.
I was over there.
Fact is, we country people
got no city conveniences and all.
So we pollute, as they say, as best
we can off in the underbrush.
What exactly do you mean?
Well, how should I say this,
excuse me, I came here to...
...take a dump.
Only when I saw him, I didn't feel
like taking a dump no more.
Just kind'a bound up, you know.
Take down all the provisions.
Dear Dani,
I don't understand why you reject me...
...but I know that one day
you will understand me.
Do you remember the promise
you made when you were a child?
Thank goodness you
don't wash your car.
I have 2 tickets for the concert
on Thursday. Franz.
I don't know how to say this.
The pain starts here and
up all the way to here.
- Didn't you say your husband was ill?
- But who cares about him.
When we get home you won't mind
giving me a treatment too.
We live under the same roof anyway.
That's strange!
What are you stopping for?
We are going to be late.
Why did you stop here, it's a curve!
Then take down my license.
I have insurance. Report it.
What license? What insurance?
Hey, come back here! Cornuto!
When I think if a truck hadn't
run into me by chance...
...I would never have known
you were still here.
Some people call it Providence.
Franz would have called it necessity.
