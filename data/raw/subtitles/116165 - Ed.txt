(BASEBALL BAT STRIKING BALL)
MAN 1: Oh, that one's gone!
MAN 2: Okey-dokey, gents.
That there is a perfect example
of how not to get an invite to
pitch for the Santa Rosa Rockets.
So, who's our next victim?
Look at them boots!
(PLAYERS CHATTERING)
Bill's gonna take
this kid downtown.
Thanks.
(EXHALES)
Ow! Damn! (RADAR GUN BEEPING)
MAN 2: Lordy! Let me see
that radar gun, son.
Holy torpedo, Batman!
I think we got a rocket arm.
Excuse me, uh, sir?
Hell of an arm. Thanks.
You ever play pro ball? Nope.
Semi-pro? Nope.
College? High school?
Little League?
No.
Uh, kid, did anyone
ever see you pitch?
Uh, my mom.
(ROOSTER CROWING)

(YAWNING)
Oh, Speed! What did you
let me sleep in for?
Today's the big day.
I love you, too, buddy,
but you got the worst
breath on Planet Earth.
Hey, Speed, wanna
help me get loose, huh?
Set?
(COW MOOING)
Go.
Go get it.
(GROANING)
Don't forget the paper.
(MACHINE PUMPING)
(COW MOOING)
All right, Daisy. All right.
(GRUNTS)
(MACHINE STARTS)
I aim to please, ladies.
(MOOING CONTINUES)
Bon appetit, Wilbur.
Wilbur?
Mornin', Charlotte.
Where's Wilbur?
Wilbur! Mom, you didn't.
Come on, eat him, honey.
It's your big day.
You need the protein.
I can't. I'm sorry.
Well, I can. Give me that.
I'm late anyway. I gotta go.
Deuce, think fast.
You're ready. Get outta here.
So, uh, no advice?
Work hard, son. Dad!
Jack.
Have fun.
Dad, it's baseball.
How could I not have fun?
(WHIMPERING)
COOPER: All right, I gotta go.
You be good, huh?
Wanna get it
one more time? Ready?
He's right. I'm ready.
I love you, Speed.

(HEART BEATING)
(LOUD GULP)
ART: Jack "The Deuce" Cooper,
sure not having
any fun out there.
(LAUGHS) Yikes!
Well, here comes a reason
for Cooper to gag.
The only thing bigger than
his hunk of chaw is his bat.
I am talking about Number 13,
the leading batter in Class A,
Kurt "The Crush" Bunyon.
The Crush sports a .397
average, 22 homers...
(CHUCKLING)
and an attitude to match.
What the hell
you lookin' at, taco?
(SPITS)
MAN: What do you say now, Coop?
(MEN LAUGHING)
(GROWLING)
ART: Cooper's been shaking off
fastball signs all afternoon,
trying to get what we heard was a
mean curveball over the plate.
Get him out!
But, from what I've seen,
it ain't mean,
and it sure don't curve.
God's sakes! Tell me he ain't
gonna throw the curve, Tip.
"He ain't gonna throw
the curve, Tip."
(GRUNTING)
(SPECTATORS EXCLAIM)
Whoa! (SCREAMS)
Sorry.
Oh, no, no, no. Not your fault, Joe.
Not your fault.
That scared the crap out of me.
The rookie's pitching today.
ANNOUNCER: (ON TV)
Baseball's a game...
(SIGHS) Poor guy.
But in his minor league debut,
the pressure's causing
a slight choking problem.
That proves it.
He's a choke artist.
(CLEARING THROAT) What are you
doin' about it, Chubb, hmm?
Kirby, I'm working on it.
I'll tell you this much.
"Chokeitis" is
a very delicate matter.
And only an idiot would be
rubbing his nose in it.
Hey, tell me something
I don't know.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Anyhoo, the reason I'm here.
(KNUCKLES CRACKING)
What the hell is this?
Innovation, Chubb.
Dad bought him from the estate of a Mr.
Mickey Mantle.
It'll put butts
in the bleachers,
and that, my friend,
is money in the bank.
Come on, you're not
serious, are you?
Look at me, Chubb.
Chubb, do I look
like I'm joking?
No, sir, I can...
I can see you got
your thinking cap on.
It's just that the boys
aren't gonna like it.
The boys aren't paying
your salary.
Neither are you.
Your old man is.
Hmm.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
(CHUCKLES)
MAN: I'll catch up with
you a little bit later.
(PLAYERS CHATTERING)
Hey. Don't sweat
the pitch, Jack.
Your luck's gonna change.
Before cut week?
(LAUGHS) Well, you're not the
only guy wonderin' that.
Look at a guy like Carlton Fisk.
He couldn't even
get arrested in Boston,
so he moves to Chicago,
changes his number,
and where's he headed now?
That's right. Cooperstown.
Coop, Fisk ain't headed for Cooperstown
because he changed his number.
The way you've been pitching,
the only thing you're
ever gonna have in common
with the Hall of Fame
is your name.
Now, here, pick this
guy up tomorrow.
8:00 a.m. at the bus.
Well, why me?
Well, I guess
it's your lucky day.
Thank you.
COOPER: Excuse me.
I'm, uh, supposed
to pick up a ballplayer.
Last row.
(CHUCKLES)
Hey! Hey, buddy, wake up!
Hey! (GROANING)
Wow! What a glove!
(SNARLING)
Ooh! No!
(BUS DRIVER LAUGHING)
(CHITTERING)
Huh?
(BUS DOOR CLOSING)
This is some kind
of a joke, right?
Just what I need, a monkey.
(CHITTERING)
All right, very funny.
I'm laughing. Ha-ha.
Can we go now?
All right, come on.
Get in the truck.
All right, be a good boy.
Now, get in the truck.
(WHISTLES)
Come on. Get in the truck.
(CHITTERING)
(SIGHS)
(CHITTERING CONTINUES)
Fine, suit yourself.
But it's a long walk home.
And you got some
seriously short legs.
Hey. Hey! Stay. Stay! Stay!
Stay! Stay!
(CHITTERING)
In the back. In the back.
No, no, no, no! You in the back!
In the back! Get in the back!
(SNIFFING)
In the back!
(CHITTERING)
Open the door.
(CHATTERING)
Stop messin' around. I had
a really bad day, okay?
Open the door.
(UNLOCKING DOOR) All right.
(LOCKING DOOR) Oh!
Open the door! Open it!
(KISSING) Oh, that's attractive.
Open the door.
Open the door!
(EXCLAIMS IN FRUSTRATION)
Open it! Don't play with those.
Don't play with those!
Come on! Don't...
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!
Please, no! Come on!
This is ridiculous.
Thank you. Oh.
I suppose you drive too.
(CHITTERING)
(PLAYERS CHATTERING)
(CHITTERING)
CHUBB: Wait a minute.
Hold on there.
Easy, easy! Hold your horses.
Slow down, rookie.
PLAYER: Oh, yeah!
Uh, fellas, I want you to
meet Mickey Mantle's monkey.
Curious George! Cool!
I have read all your books.
Randall.
Gentlemen, meet your new mascot.
Kirby figures
he'll sell tickets.
This is my assistant.
Buderick J. Halsten.
The pleasure is mine.
(CHITTERING) Hey! Oh.
(CHUCKLING)
You call me Buddy, okay?
KIRBY: Buderick, no!
Ow!
BUDDY: Gotta get a tetanus shot.
I am Mr. Woods, your owner.
Now, you keep that in mind, and
we'll get along just fine.
Nice monkey, okay.
Oh, no! It's not a toy.
That is private property!
BUDDY: Stop that. You give the nice
man back his hair. Put it down!
Back it up! No!
Back it up! No!
(STUTTERING) No. Give, give.
Watch this, Jack.
Where are your manners?
It's mine!
(ALL LAUGHING)
Cover me. Cover me.
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)
Carry on, gentlemen.
(SIGHS)
I expect you to treat
him as an equal.
That shouldn't be too difficult.
(BLOWING RASPBERRY)
Hi. I'm Randall Cszonka.
Where's The Man
in the Yellow Hat?
CHUBB: Cszonka, I don't think
he wants to talk right now.
Hey, why don't you
hit some balls, huh?
Knock some of those rocks loose?
PLAYER: Come on, now.
Come on, now. Let's go.
All right,
everybody back to work!
Coop, did he do anything
on the ride over?
Well, on the freeway, he stuck
his face out the window
and slobbered
in the wind like a dog.
(CHUCKLES) That's all?
Yeah. What do you expect?
He's an animal, Chubb.
It's not like he
plays ball or anything.
Well... PLAYER: Heads!
(ED SCREECHING)
UMPIRE: Out!
(CHUCKLES) No, Coop.
It's not like he plays
ball or anything.
Oh, uh, how's your arm?
Can you throw too?
(LAUGHING) (CHITTERING)
(CHITTERING)
(LAUGHS GOOFILY) Cool.
COOPER: Whoa!
Whoo! (LAUGHTER)
Hijole, nobody could
beat his throw, Mano.
Dudes! Dudes!
With an arm like that,
man, it would make us
look great!
You're kidding, right?
No, no, no, no. Come on,
come on, hey, Coop.
Look, remember,
biologically speaking,
he's this close to you and me.
Okay, and there ain't much to bein' a
ballplayer if you're a ballplayer.
Look at Zonk.
(GROANING)
(ALL LAUGHING)
Hey, Coop, what's his name?
I don't know. "Ed," I think.
You guys play with the monkey, all right?
I got work to do.
Eduardo, as they say back
home, mi casa es su casa.
Eddie, hell of a rifle you got goin', bud.
Welcome aboard, dude.
(GRUNTS)
(LAUGHS) He's strong, man.
You're tickling me.
Yo, come on, Ed. Hey, come on.
Get him! No! No, no!
(LAUGHING EXCITEDLY)
Not a bad idea.
(EXHALES)
CHUBB: Come on, ladies, don't be shy.
Take your chances.
Short stick rooms
with the monkey.
PLAYER: Hey, it won't be me.
I'll tell you that right now.
(CLEARS THROAT)
(CLEARS THROAT) You okay, Chubb?
Come on, take it, for cry...
(PLAYERS MURMURING)
(CLEARS THROAT)
Gee, I wonder which one
I'm gonna get.
Well, I'll be dumped
in sheep dip.
(PLAYERS LAUGHING)
Sleep tight, rookie.
(PLAYERS CHATTERING)
PLAYER 1: Don't get
too close, eh, Coop.
PLAYER 2: Sorry, Coop.
How the hell did that happen?
Well, I guess
it's like I said, huh?
Must be your lucky day.
Forget it, Chubb. No way.
Come on. Everything
was fair and square.
Chubb, he doesn't even like me.
(CHITTERING)
Yeah, he does...
Look at that, huh?
(LAUGHING)
Yeah, well, I don't like him.
Oh, I don't care. You room with Ed.
Case closed.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Watch the door!
This is a classic.
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTS BACK)
All right, this way. Come on.
Oh, no, no, no, no. I carry
my food, you carry your food.
Look, Mom! LYDIA: I know
he's up there, Liz.
No, he...
He would've talked to me a dozen
times already if he wanted to.
Mom, just look.
(LAUGHS) Excuse me?
Uh, you know, most
people just get a dog.
COOPER: Oh, he's not mine.
He belongs to the team.
He's the new mascot.
I'm sort of baby-sitting.
LIZ: He got a name, Mr.
Deuce? (GROANS)
Yeah, Ed. His name's Ed.
Hi, Ed. I'm Liz.
I live downstairs.
He's pretty cute.
Yeah, I guess.
Do you like back hair?
(LAUGHING)
Well, it works on him.
Uh, do you want
to come over for dinner?
Only if Ed comes.
I'm making spaghetti.
Honey, there's one more bag in the car.
Could you go get it?
Uh... Whoa! Ed!
(CHITTERING)
Would you look at that?
The perfect man.
(CHUCKLES)
Look, Mom.
He likes your flowers.
Well, that proves it.
I'm glad someone around
here stops and smells 'em.
Are you trying
to tell me something?
No, I just invited you over for
spaghetti, trying to be neighborly.
Thought people from
Oregon were into that.
COOPER: Apparently,
people from Oregon
are into choking
when it really counts.
Until I work out
of this slump, I...
I gotta take a rain check.
But thanks.
(WHISTLES)
(LAUGHS)
LIZ: Bye, Ed.
(CHITTERS)
See you later.
He is one troubled guy.
I guess. But he's
got a great butt.
Elizabeth!
(CHITTERING)
(GROANING)
COOPER: What? I just moved in.
Give me a break.
And that business downstairs
with the groceries.
Oh, you're such a brown noser.
Yeah. Look at it.
It's totally brown.
(CHITTERING)
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
(HITS ED'S BACK)
(COUGHS) Huh?
Didn't your mother ever
tell you not to do that?
Get down! Get down off of there.
(KNOCKING ON TABLE)
Get down!
What's the matter with you?
(LOUD WHIMPERING)
Oh, oh, okay. All right.
Come on. Outside.
Outside. Come on. Outside.
Hurry up. Come on.
No, no, not in my bathroom!
Get out of there.
I'm warning you.
(UNZIPPING)
(ED GRUNTING)
Don't you do it.
(FARTING)
Oh, bad monkey! Bad! Damn it!
(ED MOANING)
Get outta there!
(TOILET FLUSHES)
You blew it, pal.
How could you poop where
I go to the bathroom, huh?
Oh, I'm gonna be sick. Hey! Come here!

with the air freshener too.

Where do you think you're going?
Not in there.
That's my bedroom! No!

(QUIET CHITTERING) (CLATTERING)
(EXCITED CHITTERING)
Whee! (GASPS)
Very impressive.
Does this mean you want
to help me practice, Ed?
All right, watch this.
(CHITTERING)
You think you're the only guy
with an arm around here, Ed? Huh?
No problem.
(EXCITED CHITTERING)
(GROANS) Why can't I
do this in a game?
Oh, geez, we're late! Ed!
Enough goofin' around.
Let's hit it.
(CHITTERING)
Nice.
ART: The Sharks are eating
Cooper alive in the fourth.
Hi, Uncle Art.
Hey, Lizzie.
If you weren't my niece,
I'd make you pay for that.
One day you'll
thank me, Uncle Art.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, Cooper leans in
for the sign.
He's shaking it off, again!
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Oh, no, Deuce, don't.
Even start thinking about it.
Hey, Coop. He'll tag it.
Don't throw the...
(GROANS)
My God, he's gonna
throw the curve again.
BARNETT: Show time.
Sit down, Barnett!
Whoa!
In!
ART: (OVER LOUDSPEAKER)
That ball is history.
(LAUGHING) Oh, boy!
And from the look on Chubb's
face, so is Cooper.
Guess we know where he's headed.
RODRIGUEZ: Hey, Coop, turn around.
PLAYER: Hey, Jack.
(LAUGHING) I know you got a lot on
your mind, but, I mean, come on.
RODRIGUEZ: Turn around.
He's washing the bad luck
off his uniform, Anderson.
Yeah, well, he better stand
under Niagara Falls for a week,
with a case of Tide
and a wire brush.
Yeah, right, dude.
(LAUGHING) BARNETT: I'm
only trying to thank him.
Thanks.
Look, nobody's ever thrown
a perfect curveball,
so I know that's
still up for grabs.
But the world's worst curve,
that can never be thrown again.
Because, Deuce,
you just threw it.
Great speech, Barnett. Just so
I don't forget a word of it,
why don't you take that
pencil out of your pants
and write it down for me?
(PLAYERS LAUGHING)
Dude.
KIRBY: Hey, Cooper,
got a minute?
Yeah, Cooper, got a minute?
COOPER: No. Good.
KIRBY: All right, then.
Enough levity.
We're all big boys here.
Really big boys.
A little word to the wise.
You choke, you croak.
Okay?
Cooper! You left
the water on again.
California's half desert, son.
Waste not, want not.

(PLAYERS LAUGHING)
(PLAYER WHOOPING)
(CHUCKLES)
I said yes, but later.
Well, what's the occasion?
Since when do you need a special
occasion to drink a beer?
No, I just meant...
Why the umbrella was on it.
Huh? Oh, those.
We're 30 games in.
Already?
(CHUCKLES) Let's start
with a real easy one, huh?
(TISKS) Barnett.
Heads.
Looks like he'll be
in the majors someday.
Still works.
Cooper.
Well, hacksaw my legs
and call me "Shorty".
Okay, shorty, I'll try it again.
No, no. No.
Let it set there a while.
We'll see what side
Cooper comes up on.
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
How about that?
Here you go.
(MICROWAVE BEEPING)
Stuff builds

(CHITTERING)
No, I'm not eating that.
Mine's right here.
Ooh. This looks good.
Uh-uh-uh-uh!
(WHIMPERING)
Right there. That's yours.
Right there.
(SIGHS)
Hey, Speed loves this stuff.
Look. Look at that.
Gold medal. See that?
Now, dig in, stinky. (WHIMPERS)

It's great.

Oh, my God, there's so

I couldn't believe it.
I didn't come here with the

Wastin' what?
"Wastin' what?" Duh. The luck.
Man, this is precious,
you know, like gold.
(PLAYERS CHATTERING)
Oh, my God!

Who's seen my bag of dirt?
(SNIFFING) Have you seen
my lucky bag of dirt?
Oh, that is fresh.
(LAUGHS)
(TIPTON CHUCKLES)
TIPTON: Cut week's comin', Ed.
You'll see guys hangin' onto the
craziest things you've ever seen.
Rabbit's feet, earwax.
But it's all rubber crutches.
They'll collapse if you
lean on 'em too much.
There ain't no luck in here.
(CHUCKLES)
All the luck you'll ever
need is right in here,
and in here.
And I got a little something
for you to wrap
and protect it in.
Now, what do you think of that?
(CHITTERING)
(EXCLAIMS EXCITEDLY)
That a boy.
(CHITTERING)
We even got you number
seven, just like the Mick.
(LAUGHING)
He sure loves this game.
PLAYER: Let's get
a good one today, fellas.
Lucky guy.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
In here and in here. Huh?
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
(LAUGHS)
PLAYER: That a boy, Coop.
Use that luck.
(CHUCKLING) Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
(CROWD CHEERING)
Get him out! Get him out!
Get him out!
(STADIUM ORGAN PLAYING)

(GROANS) (CROWD BOOING)
You can lead the boy to water
or you can take the fish
out of the country,
but you can't make
the horse drink, Chubb.
Yeah, that's clear as mud.
What's next?
ART: The pitch is popped up!
Way, way, way up.
ANDERSON: I got it!
Anderson's under it,
and he's... down.
Can you believe it?
I had to ask.
Give him a hand.
ART: I've seen
better hands on a snake.
Time, Ump!
UMPIRE: Who you
gonna sub, Chubb?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
ART: The ump calls time
as they haul the lanky third
baseman back to the dugout.
Ooh, but that gives me a chance
to remind you good folks
that Tuesday is Rocket Day
at Joe's Quick Lube.
Come in for an oil change, and
get a free ticket to the game.
It's a good deal
for those tired wheels.
Okay, Ed, let's
give it a shot, huh?
(CHITTERING EXCITEDLY)
Hey, Chubb! Sub the monkey.
He's the best looking
player you got.
Farley, that's the first good
idea you've had in 20 years.
ART: Oh, isn't that cute?
Ed's tagging along with Chubb.
Hang onto your peanuts,
Rockets fans.
Playin' third, Chubb?
Well, reserve third.
A hell of a glove.
What the hell's
going on here, Bobby?
Tell Chubb to get this
animal off the field.
We got a ballgame to play.
Can this animal
play ball, Chubb?
Why, it's all he does.
Stats, rule book!
Player eligibility.
There exists no rule that requires a
player to be of Homo sapien origin.
Homo what?
(LAUGHS) Oh, wait a minute.
You guys are yankin' my chain.
You're in on this
together, right?
It's a monkey,
for crying out loud.
A chimpanzee, actually.
His name's Ed.
(STUTTERING)
Sullivan. Ed Sullivan.
I think he's serious, Greg.
No, no, he's not serious.
Chubb, you're not putting
that monkey in this game.
That monkey does not play
in this baseball game.
Look, we let all kinds
of people play this game...
Oh, that's big of you, Greg.
Now, that's not what I mean.
You know that's not
what I mean, Bobby.
But when it comes to a
monkey, I draw the line.
No, no, it's not a monkey.
He's a third baseman.
Fine. But I am not gonna be
a part of this travesty!
Oh, fine! You're outta here!
Fine!
(CROWD CHEERING)
Baseball is America's game.
Every American,
regardless of race,
creed, color, species,
body hair, brain size,
has the right to play the game.
(CHITTERING)
Take your position, son.
Play ball!
Why not? No outs, bases loaded,
top of the sixth, ape on third.
You know, I'm probably the first
announcer in history who's said that.
I'll alert the media.
Oh, darling.
I am the media.
(CHITTERING)
UMPIRE: He's out!
(CROWD CHEERING)
UMPIRE: You're out!
(CHITTERING)
Damn!
That's the first unassisted
triple play I ever seen, Chubb!
Tip, I, just this second, became
totally unafraid of dying.
(CHEERING)
Looks like we got us
a third baseman.
(LAUGHING) Yeah!
(CHEERING)
He's short, Chubb.
Real short.
Teeniest strike zone
I ever seen.
Now, look, we can win

Four balls. Four balls.
Am I gettin' through

Here you go.
Snafu, Ed. We don't carry
bats in your size.
(GRUNTING)
(LAUGHING)
PLAYER: Get him, Ed. We do now.
(LAUGHING)
ART: How do you pitch to a guy
with a strike zone
smaller than the ball?
Well, folks, with the
game tied in the ninth
and the bases loaded,
the Devils' pitcher
better figure it out fast.
Come on, come on,
what you say, Ed?
Banana daiquiris

UMPIRE: Ball one!

(CROWD CHEERING LOUDLY)
Here we go, Ed.
Get something going. Go.
(CHITTERING)
Huh?
(CHUCKLES)
Goddamn!
Fellas, I hate giving this talk,
but, well, that's my job.
We've had a great ride lately.
We're right back
in the pennant race,
and, well, you all
should be proud.
You played hard,
and that's what counts.
So don't take it
personally if you get cut.
PLAYER: I don't wanna get cut.
CHUBB: That's just business.
If it was up to me, I'd

Okay.

What's Dizzy gonna do now, huh?
Play dirt leagues for 10 years,
find some crappy job and die
knowing he wasn't good
enough for the Show.
What the hell do
you know, Barnett?
Huh? Dizzy will be a

Does your mom make you do all your

Duh.
Well, that's it, Liz. See, it doesn't

There's still work stuff that you
gotta do before you can have any fun.
Prioritizing, you mean?
(CHUCKLING) Yeah, that's it.
You got it.
If I use a semi-bad word,

Oh, I heard you,

I'm gonna tell you
something I never told
another ballplayer
in my whole life.
Lighten the hell up.
It's called a ballgame.
It involves a ball,
and it's a game.
It's... Well, it's
supposed to be fun.
When was the last time
you had any fun?
I don't know, Chubb.
That's what I figured.
Now, take the day off.

Hey, Liz, do you think your mom would

Whatever it takes, big guy.
I think I can

Ed's just earned me

and you'll be worth
a lot of money, too.
You traded him?
I sold him!
Hey, you guys. The Rug sold Ed.

(ALL PROTESTING)
CHUBB: Yeah, Coop's right.
The Rug sold him.
Now, look, I want you to concentrate

And remember, I loved him

TIPTON: All right, all right.
(ALL GRIPING)
COOPER: It's not right, Chubb.
He's not an animal, Chubb.
He's a ballplayer.
Ballplayers get traded.
Remember what Durocher said. "God
watches over drunks and third basemen."
But he didn't say
anything about pitchers.
Now, one more thing.
Woods is bringing Lasorda here
for the championship game.
The way you pitched today, you pitch
like that when Lasorda is here, and...
It could be a ticket
to the big leagues for you.
(CHUCKLES)
(SIGHS)
How do they expect him
to play without his glove?
I don't know, honey.
But it's his property.
COOPER: Well, the way they
see it, Ed's just an animal.
So, I guess he really
doesn't own anything.
He owned third base.
Oh, Liz.
(SIGHS)
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
What am I supposed to do?
Ah! Hey!
Kirby sold him. What
do you want me to do?
Steal him back? Yeah!
There's an idea.
Come on, Lydia, I can't do that.
When Jack Cooper is in trouble,
you work twice as hard.
When it's anyone else,
it's just too much trouble.
That's not true!
That's great, Jack!
If Liz ever gets kidnapped, remind me not
to go after her. It's too much trouble.
If your best friend can't
count on you, who can?
Don't choke now, Deuce.
Hey, Deuce.
Hey.
Wait. What the hell
are you doing here?
You're starting today
for the pennant.
Yeah. But, I left my glove in
the locker room last road trip.
It's my lucky glove, you know?
Hey, you better hurry.

you're gonna make me owner.

And that'll put the go-ahead run

Folks, Cooper has carried his

throws a 100-mile-per-hour fastballs for
nine innings without paying the price.
(SIGHS)

Top of the ninth, go-ahead
run at the plate, two outs.
And the bad news?
Ladies and gentlemen, now
pinch-hitting for the Devils,
Kurt "The Crush" Bunyon.
(CROWD CHEERING)
Don't get much badder than that.
The Crush has been
on injured reserve,
but the way he's been

he is gonna bite the bullet
for a shot at bringing the
championship home for the Devils.
Your ace is here.
Tough luck, Deuce.
Take it easy, huh?
Just take it easy.
Chubb, I need a decision.
Okay, ump. All right.
