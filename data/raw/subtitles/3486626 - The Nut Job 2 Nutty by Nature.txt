You might think life is easy
for a cute little squirrel
with a fluffy tail,
but it's not.
Sure, when kids see you in
the park, they go, "Aww!"
Aww!
- If you're lucky, they give you nuts.
- Huh.
If you're unlucky,
they are nuts.
Being the little guy means
everything's out to get you.
Bikes.
Cars.
Gum.
Ugh.
Whoa!
But things got a whole
lot better last summer
when the nut shop
went out of business
and left a lifetime supply
of food in the basement.
For once,
the little guy at the bottom of
the food chain came out on top.
Cannonball!
- You the man, Surly!
- Ha-ha! Thank you. Thank you.
I call that one the Peanut Buster.
Patent pending.
Excellent. A very tight tuck.
And a high degree of difficulty.
Pfft. I prefer a cleaner entry.
A little too much splash.
Whoa! Nice. Ten.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
gotta get back to slacking off.
Looking good, Surly!
Hey, Bruce, remember to pace yourself.
Why would I wanna do that?
Playing with your food. Nice.
- Look out!
- Whoa!
Slow down or someone's gonna get hurt.
That's the plan!
Yee-ha!
Precious. Come on, that's
disgusting. We talked about this.
- No lick-licks.
- Uh, sorry, boss.
It's hard to respect your personal
space when you taste like peanut butter.
There's a peanut butter
machine right there.
No way! Peanut butter!
Come on. Daddy needs a new pair of shoes.
What do you need shoes
for? You're a wild animal.
Come on, snake eyes!
One peanut colada coming right up.
Keep 'em coming, Morty!
All right, clear a path.
Mixed nuts coming through.
Stuff your face until it's pink.
How many peanuts can you drink?
Hot, fresh popcorn!
The fun never stops
with the corn that pops!
Popcorn here!
Get your popcorn!
No fair. Mine didn't pop.
That was awesome!
This is the life, Buddy, huh?
Kickin' back. Literally doing nothing.
Remember when we had to
work for these things?
Come on, Dad. Hurry up.
Careful, sweetheart. Not too fast.
There it is.
With a little hard work and
determination, that nut will be ours.
Uh, Andie,
why don't we just get free nuts
from the nut shop like everyone else?
Does anybody else think that's a good idea?
- Uh, yeah. I do. I do.
- Ooh, ooh! Ooh, ooh!
No. It's a terrible idea.
Ooh.
Come on, guys. We're wild animals.
Living off the nut shop is unnatural.
But their products are a
hundred percent organic.
Now, who thinks we should go get that nut?
Guys, this is when you're
supposed to put your hands up.
- Right!
- Okay!
That's better.
Now, pay attention because
this will be on the test.
Remember, the nut is your friend.
It's been waiting its whole life for this.
Place your hands at ten
and two and gently pu...
Gently pull.
Uh, Andie, will this be on the test?
Please hold all questions until
the end of the demonstration.
- The nut shop's looking better and better.
- Mm-hmm.
See, class? Hard work always pays off.
Ooh!
Ooh!
See? That wasn't so bad.
Now we can squirrel that
nut away for the winter.
Who wants to go to the nut shop?
Nut shop!
Whoo-hoo!
Johnny's got the early lead,
but Jimmy's close behind.
Official eating contest
rules are in full effect.
Any regurgitory reversals will
result in disqualification.
Yay!
Whoo-hoo!
Here come peanuts!
Attaboy, Johnny! Show
those nuts who's boss.
Are you joking?
An eating contest?
What? It's good for morale.
Surly.
Hold that cranky response.
I got you something.
- A Brazil nut?
- Yeah.
It's, uh, exotic. I, uh,
thought you might like, uh...
That's really sweet.
I... I can't believe you saved it for me.
But, you know, I won't
take food from the nut shop.
Well, that was supposed
to play out differently.
Living off the nut shop was okay in the
beginning, but look at what it's become.
And Jimmy tries to take the lead
with his patented hammer-head technique.
What a tremendous athlete!
Ha-ha! Classic.
This is not what animals do.
We work hard. We store. We save.
Look at all of you. Lazy and spoiled and...
fat.
Who you calling fat?
Hmm.
Come back to the park, Surly.
It's where we belong.
That's my favorite thing about being mayor.
You get to sign your own permits.
Hear! Hear!
Every square inch of this
city is generating profits.
How else could we skim enough off the top
to build ourselves that
private golf course?
Am I right, people?
Fore!
But I've got a thorn in my side.
One part of this city
puts nothing in my pocket.
Liberty Park.
Nothing but grass and trees.
Sittin' on premium city real
estate, generates zero profit.
And I can't very well charge
children to climb trees now, can I?
I'll look into it, sir. Dollar a climb?
No need.
I got bigger plans than trees.
Andie, come back. Come on, what's with you?
- Why are you so mad?
- The animals are losing their instincts.
They're not gathering or
storing anything for winter,
and they're not working together.
Take it easy.
That's all anybody does around here.
Take it easy.
♪ For she's A jolly good eater ♪
What's wrong with easy?
Easy doesn't build character.
Easy doesn't last.
That's ridiculous.
Look at 'em.
Working together, building character.
Morale is at an all-time high.
- You've got to get with the program, Andie.
- It's a house of cards, Surly,
and it's only a matter of time
till it comes crashing down.
Relax. It's not like the
nut shop's gonna explode.
Aah!
Oh, no.
The peanut butter machine was in there.
Oh, I can still taste you on my lips.
No.
Oh, dear.
Mole, you had one job.
What was that again?
Shut off the boiler so it doesn't explode.
It's not my fault. I told Jimmy to do it.
I told Johnny to do it.
I told Jamie to do it.
And I told Mole to do it.
Oh, right. It is my fault.
What are we going to do, Surly?
Yeah, what are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna get food?
It's okay.
It's okay. We'll be fine.
We'll just go back to scrounging
and gathering like nature intended.
- This will be a good thing.
- What?
You think the nut shop
blowing up is a good thing?
Well, I got news for you.
Nobody's gonna gather.
Nobody's gonna scrounge.
Nobody's gonna break their back
collecting dirty old stale acorns.
Sit down, put your feet up and
Surly will take care of everything.
It's over, Surly.
Things can't go back to the way they were.
I'll find a new place, even
better than the nut shop.
Like a nut market.
Or a nut emporium.
In fact, why limit ourselves to nuts?
The city's got everything.
Popcorn, doughnuts, hot dog on a stick.
Hot dog on a stick?
Yeah!
I love hot dogs.
I love sticks.
What do you say, Buddy? You in?
You can do it, Surly!
Bring us back a smorgasbord!
Hot dog on a stick! Hot dog on a stick!
There are no shortcuts in life, Surly.
Oh, really?
Come on, Buddy. Let's take the shortcut.
When we find food, Andie's
gonna be all like...
"Oh, Surly, you were right all along
and I was wrong all along."
"Please, Andie, don't
beat yourself up about it."
"Oh, Surly,
you're so wise and forgiving
and kind and nice and furry."
"Shh.
Don't worry, Andie. I forgive you."
Huh?
Jackpot.
Or should I say... Le Jackpot.
Oh, baby, you gotta
try this "es-car-got."
Oh, that's good!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Move it, Buddy! Let's go!
Get out of my restaurant,
you disgusting rodents!
Jackpot.
Salty, overpriced snack
food jackpot. Come on.
Thank you, popcorn.
Oh! Yes.
Buddy, look. One left.
Oh, come on!
All units, we have a
code seven in progress.
That's half-priced
doughnuts, people.
- Get moving.
- Dibs on the jelly! Get in there! Get in there!
Jackpot. Deep-fried, honey-glazed,
artery-clogging jackpot.
You... Get back here!
Not the doughnut. Not the doughnut.
Wow. Those guys are
serious about doughnuts.
Ah, let's face it. There's
no food for us out here.
Let's go back to the park.
This is our stop.
Pay attention. Timing is everything.
One, two, three.
I forgot to account for the mailbox.
Everyone is gonna expect us to have food.
So we're gonna need to
let them down easy. Got it?
All right, follow my lead.
Look.
- Hey, Surly's back.
- Huh?
- Come on.
- Yay, Surly!
- Surly!
- Surly!
Did you find food?
Uh...
They found food!
What Buddy means is we found
food, but it's complicated.
Did you find popcorn?
Buddy!
Did you find doughnuts?
Here's the thing.
- How many doughnuts?
- Everybody, hold on.
Eight doughnuts?
There is no food!
We're all gonna die!
Everybody calm down.
Calm down.
Thank you.
Come on, guys. Look around.
We're the luckiest animals in the world.
Our park has everything we need.
♪ This park's our home ♪
- What are you doing?
- Singing.
It felt like the right thing to do.
When's the last time you saw somebody
spontaneously break into song?
Oh, come on, they were into it.
It was a little awkward.
You're not a great singer.
Honestly, it was kind of pitchy.
Geez. Tough crowd.
We all love the park, but please,
please never do that again.
One question! One question!
Ladies and gentlemen of the
press, welcome to Liberty Park.
I think we can all agree this boring
old park needs a shot in the arm.
Behold!
Libertyland!
The greatest place on Earth!
Who wants a regular park
when you can have an amusement park?
It's more fun, more rides, more games.
And more profit.
Libertyland is my greatest creation!
You told me I was your greatest creation.
No, no. Of course you are, sweetheart.
Now, Libertyland is my
second greatest creation.
No, no, no. This is all wrong.
I want the Tilt-a-Whirl
here, bumper cars here
and cotton candy here, here,
here, here, here and here!
That's a lot of cotton candy now, snookums.
We don't want your teeth to fall out.
But I want it!
Okay, she wants her teeth
to fall out. Let's do it.
Can we get some more cotton
candy in here, please?
- Yes, sir.
- Now!
- This doesn't look good.
- Why don't you sing a song about it?
Mr. Mayor, over here. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor.
What's going to happen to
the animals in the park?
Ah. Nobody cares about these animals.
Nobody cares more than me.
But don't you worry. I
will take care of 'em.
I will make sure they're all taken care of.
And without further ado, let
the ground-breaking begin.
Look at that sign.
They're gonna destroy the park.
We're all gonna die!
Calm down. It's a fat
guy with a tiny shovel.
How much damage can he do?
Oh, I get it.
The tiny shovel was a symbolic gesture.
Oh, no!
Run!
Well, my work here is done.
You see, sweetheart? I make
the speech, they do the work.
Whew.
Aah!
Abandon park!
Hey, where's everyone going?
Wait up.
Andie. Andie!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, slow
down. Who put you in charge?
This isn't about who's in charge, Surly.
It's about keeping us safe.
Are you saying I can't keep us safe?
You had your chance to take care
of the group and you blew it.
Instead of doing what was
right, you did what was easy.
Easy? Ha.
Look at you. You're running away.
What could be easier than that?
I'm sorry. What do you think we should do?
We, uh...
We fight.
- Fight the humans?
- We're all gonna die!
Tiny animals do not fight
humans with giant machines.
If you wanna tuck tail and run, go ahead,
but I'm staying here.
This park belongs to us,
and I think it's worth fighting for.
Let's go get 'em. Who's with me?
We're with you, Surly.
Heck, yes, we are.
Ha.
Please, Surly, think
about what you're saying.
- For the park!
- Whee!
Let me show you guys how it's done.
In the name of the park, I order
you to stop your vehicle and... Aah!
So much for peaceful protest.
Let's see you drive without this.
Aah!
Whoa! Surly!
- That was awesome.
- You okay?
I'm good.
But you guys get the next one.
So I told the foreman, "My head's
so thick I don't need a hard hat."
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
Hold on! I'll be done in a second! Whoa!
Don't forget to flush.
Let's trash this place.
I'm defiling this thing.
This is what I call a number three.
Whoa, whoa! Hey!
Look what I found. Hut, hut, hut!
Whoa! It's good!
I wonder what this thing does. Whoa! Whoa!
You guys gotta try this thing.
Trailer trash. Ah!
Nobody cuts down a tree in my park.
Fire!
I may not be aerodynamic, but
I'm an excellent projectile.
Ha! Now we both got a squished-in face.
One left. You ready, Buddy?
Go, go, go, go!
No, no, no! No, no, no! Back in the hive!
No! Not yet! Ouch! No! No!
Huh? Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Nice work, Buddy.
We took a lot of stings
for the team on that one.
How did you not get stung?
Aah!
You better run.
I'm off leash, on a rampage.
Hello.
Yep, this is he.
Yes, I received your bribe.
Oh, did I say "bribe"?
Why, I meant "campaign contribution."
- Gotta go.
- No, no. Sir...
Come in!
Um, M-Mr. Mayor?
Well, look who it is.
How nice of you
to take time out of your busy day
to come down here and let me know
that construction is right on schedule.
Actually, sir, that's not why I'm here.
Well, then you must be here to tell
me that we're ahead of schedule.
- Uh...
- 'Cause I know you ain't here to tell me
that we have fallen behind.
Sir, we were overrun by animals.
They threw our potty in the river.
Libertyland will proceed according to plan.
Some mangy little rodents
think they can stop me?
Well, I'll show them what happens
when you mess with Percival J. Muldoon.
Oh, yes, I will.
Oh, yes, I will.
Way to go, Surly!
- You saved the park!
- You did it, Surly!
Let's just say that bulldozer wrote
a check its scoop couldn't cash.
Ah. Stop that. We talked about this.
Oh, come on. We're celebrating.
Fine. One more lick, then you're cut off.
Ooh. Thanks, boss. I'm gonna make it count.
Whoa, it's gonna be a good one.
It's gonna be a good one!
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wow. That was intense.
Ooh, you taste good today.
Stale acorns, with just
a hint of bulldozer.
Way to go, everyone. We did it.
I know everyone is hungry, so I
brought you all a little surprise.
Ta-da! It's all the nuts
I was saving for winter.
Ugh. Yech!
Not exactly what I'd call "fine dining."
Oh, come on, Surly. Have one.
We're all in this together.
Where'd you get this thing,
the bottom of a vacuum bag?
Delicious!
Whew. More like dust-licious.
Hey, what the...
See? There's life after the nut shop.
Hmm.
Oh, don't be like that.
Hey. There you are.
I never got a chance to
say you were amazing today.
I'm always amazing.
Today you just happened to notice.
I'm serious.
I didn't think we stood a
chance against those bulldozers,
but when you pulled everyone
together, we were unstoppable.
Well, don't get used to
it. It was a one-time thing.
Today was a good day. Why are
you so intent on being grumpy?
Are you happy it's gone?
Surly...
Answer the question.
I'm glad we're all living
together in the park again.
- Yes.
- Even if we starve?
We're not gonna starve.
Quit being so dramatic.
Animals did just fine
before there were nut shops.
Well, sorry if I'm not as
excited about it as you are.
It would be nice if you could be.
- Excited?
- Yes.
About scrounging for dusty old nuts? Ha.
The animals look up to you,
Surly. You need to set an example.
And what do you expect me to do?
You could start by getting up at sunrise.
Get a head start on the scrounging.
The animals will wake up
and see you working hard
and think, "I should work hard too."
I'm gonna have to give that a hard pass.
I'm sleeping in.
Well, you know what they say.
"The early squirrel gets the nut."
That's not even a thing.
You just replaced "bird" with
"squirrel" and "worm" with "nut."
Well, it doesn't make it any less true.
Good night, Andie.
Rise and shine, people.
Today is going to be a great day.
I think I'm having a nightmare.
Up you get. Clap your hands.
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.
What does that make yesterday?
Hey, Precious, wake up.
She's still sleeping.
Aah!
Aah!
Hey, Andie. I'm starving.
What's for breakfast?
Whatever you want.
As long as you gather it yourself.
Are you kidding me?
Please, Andie, stop.
Quit while you're behind.
Why lounge around
when you can scrounge around
for some nuts on the ground?
Take your rhymes somewhere else, sister.
You're right. You should hang back.
Wouldn't want everybody to see that
Surly Squirrel has lost his instincts.
Hmph.
Try and keep up.
Nuts.
That's strange. Where did those come from?
♪ Uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh ♪
♪ Uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh, uh ♪
No instincts, huh? How do you explain this?
- Aah!
- Surly!
Well, this is embarrassing.
Surly's trapped. Come on.
Pull!
We're all gonna die!
More specifically, you're gonna die.
Way to keep it positive.
Get me out of here!
Pull!
It won't open. It won't open!
Mr. Mayor, you have called
the right man for the job.
You'll be back to building
your amusement park in no time.
Let me demonstrate.
The little squirrel having a nice day.
He sees a nut. "Hello there, nut."
Cage closes. We drive him
to the forest, let him go.
Good as new.
I see. And this won't hurt the animals?
Oh, no, Mr. Mayor. Humane traps only.
Nobody's hurt. Everybody's happy.
- Well, may I?
- Of course.
I don't want humane.
I want painful, gruesome termination!
Mr. Mayor,
that is a horrible and twisted
way to deal with the animals.
- Daddy.
- Oh.
I can help. I'm good at shooting
cute, little defenseless creatures.
Oh, sweetheart, Daddy is so proud of you.
Oh, look.
We got one.
Go get 'em, Frankie!
Go, Frankie! Go!
On three. Everyone, pull together.
One, two, three!
You okay?
I'm fine. I-I'm fine.
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
You had me worried there for a second.
Wait. What's that sound?
It's probably the little
paranoid voice in your head,
screaming at the top of its lungs again.
I'm serious.
You certainly are.
You know, you're not as
funny as you think you are.
Dog! Run!
Precious, help!
Aah!
Okay, someone's gonna pay for that.
Whoa.
Why is he looking at me like that?
What a beauty.
That smushed-in face. Those bulging eyes.
She's like... an angel.
Just go with it.
What? No. Gross.
You gotta go talk to him, or
that mutt is gonna rip us apart.
Ohh!
You owe me big time.
Hey there, handsome.
Hey there, precious.
What? How do you know my name?
What, your name is actually Precious?
Whoa.
My name's Frankie. It's long for "Frank."
Hey, I just had the most
unbelievable thought.
I'm Frankie. You're Precious.
That makes us... Frecious.
Keep him occupied. Try
using your feminine charm.
This is my feminine charm.
So, uh, tell me more about you.
What do you do for fun?
I would be more than happy to show you.
Come here, you! Come back here!
- Get going.
- I can't look away.
This guy's dumber than a bowling
ball with a face painted on it.
I'm gonna get you.
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
Huh? Huh?
Gotcha.
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Frankie's got a girlfriend!
Daddy, I got a new dog!
My little prince met a princess.
- Surly!
- Precious!
I'm coming for you,
Precious! Hang in there!
Ha-ha! Come on, boys!
Tonight we dine on squirrel!
Aah!
Aah!
Over the... Guys in a...
Slow down. What are you saying?
Uh...
We're all gonna die!
Oh, no! Everybody scatter!
My egg!
No one's getting scrambled on my watch.
Oh, thank you.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Everybody out. We gotta go.
Leave it. There's no time.
Guys, wait up!
Get back here, you chubby little beast!
Come on, tiny legs. Go faster!
This is so much fun! Ooh!
Oh!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ow! My fingers!
And stay out!
You're gonna pay for this.
Fire in the hole.
That's not good. Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Huh?
Aah!
I'd say we got him.
Smile.
You've completely destroyed this park.
And I must say I am a fan of your work.
All right, you layabouts, get moving.
Buckle up, sweetheart.
You know Daddy's got a lead foot.
Precious!
Surly!
We gotta rescue Precious.
It's my fault she was
taken by that crazy kid.
You and Buddy go after Precious.
I'll find us a new place to live.
- What?
- Look around, Surly. It's over.
We have to leave the park.
- Where are we gonna go?
- There's another park on the other side of town.
We'll check it out and report back.
What about the rest of
us? What should we do?
You have the most important
job of all, little guy.
Try to not get killed.
I'll try, but I can't make any promises.
Okay, let's get moving.
Hey.
Be careful out there.
Yeah. You too.
Out of my way, riffraff!
I don't have time for traffic.
Aah!
Whoa!
Faster, Daddy! Go faster!
Slow down!
I know this relationship is moving fast,
but when it's right, it's right.
No. Slow down the car!
Aah! Aah!
I voted for you.
Very nice to meet you.
Have a good day. Bye-bye.
Aah! Whoa!
Whoa!
Ow! Come on, man!
Aah!
Silly doggy. Your new home is this way.
Help!
I'm not a rescue! I need to be rescued!
Run, doggies! Run!
Whoa! Ow!
Whoa. Are you okay?
Your owner is deranged.
Yeah. She's got a screw
loose, that's for sure.
Who wants to eat today?
Oh, come on. She's gonna feed us.
I make it a rule to never
take food from psychos.
But I'm starving.
Frankie, sit.
Stand on your hind legs.
Stand on one foot.
What are you, a circus dog?
I could be. You got a
thing for circus dogs?
Play dead.
You got me. Ooh! Ah!
You got me.
Man, that is dark.
Good boy.
Life is easy when you do
exactly what you're told.
Now it's your turn.
Roll over.
I said roll over!
What are you doing? Roll over.
I don't know how. I'm
not classically trained.
Oh, boy. This ain't gonna be good.
Aah! You better learn to do some tricks
or you're gonna be hungry.
We've gotta find the mayor's
house and get Precious back.
Who are you waving to?
Oh.
No time to make new friends, Buddy.
Come on. This looks like a shortcut.
Oh, don't tell me you're scared.
Everyone knows there's nothing
safer than a dark alley.
Come on. Aah!
Just a... lovable little dolly.
Well, that's shoddy workmanship.
Aah!
Dead end. Oh, no.
This is bad.
I'm too young to die.
I'm too furry to die.
It's been nice knowing you, Buddy.
Oh. Whew.
I thought we were in real
trouble there for a second.
You scared us, you cute little guy.
Boop.
Aah!
I shouldn't have booped
his cute little nose.
Don't call me cute!
The boop was too much.
This is my city. You are on my turf.
How can someone so cute be so violent?
Ohh!
I said don't call me cute!
Got it.
My name is Mr. Feng.
I was cursed with these big adorable eyes
and this fuzzy little body.
But make no mistake.
I'm a weapon of mouse destruction.
Witness the power
of my
1/16th-of-an-inch punch.
Aw, that's cute.
And painfully efficient.
The city is no place for park animals.
My army is unstoppable.
Each mouse more deadly than the last.
If you're telling me that the
first mouse is the least deadly,
I'd like to speak with him.
Any last words?
Yeah. Just one.
Cat!
Aah!
Come on, Buddy.
There's no cat. Get them!
You were right. No more dark alleys.
Taxi!
No! Buddy!
- Run!
- Get the rat!
Get me your hand, Buddy. I got you.
Come on. Jump!
Don't let go!
If you ever come back to
the city, you are dead!
See you later, you cutie patootie.
Wow. That sounded tougher in my head.
Hurry up. The new park
is right over that wall.
What is taking them so long?
Huh. Huh. Whoa.
Huh. Huh. Whoa.
Huh. Huh. Whoa.
Huh. Huh. Whoa.
Huh. Huh. Whoa.
- Come on!
- We were just doing what the sign said.
It's as pretty as a picture.
A picture of a beautiful park.
It's perfect.
Yeah. You're right.
It's not bad.
Ohh!
- Out of my way!
- No way! Me first!
How good is this?
And we've got the place to ourselves.
Hello!
Everyone's gonna love it.
Mole can dig a new hole right over there.
The chipmunks can live in
that beautiful old tree.
Gradually hollowing it
out until it stops living.
This park has everything we need.
♪ This park's our home... ♪
- What is it?
- Beats me.
Looks delicious.
It's stuck.
Get it out!
Get it out!
At this point,
I'm tempted to let natural
selection take its course.
Get it out!
- That thing stole my ball!
- You gotta play it as it lays.
- Aah!
- That's a stroke.
That's a stroke.
I'm counting all these, Barry.
Spit that thing out.
- I'm trying. I'm trying.
- Look out!
It came out.
- Aah!
- Run that thing over!
- Look out!
- Hey!
Aah!
Aah!
Nice park, Andie. This place is great.
Buddy, look. It's the mayor's car.
Hang on, Precious. We're coming for you.
Mailbox. Good lookin' out, Buddy.
So many mailboxes.
Come on down, Buddy. I gotcha.
Were you aiming for my face?
This is gonna be a stealth mission.
So shh. Don't say a word.
That shouldn't be a problem for you.
Aah!
Okay, that's a little creepy.
Buddy, check this out.
I call that one the Flying Squirrel.
Ooh, I'm gonna kill you!
You kept me on hold for 10 minutes!
Anyhoo, the roller coaster
was delivered today.
Got a great deal on a used
one that was condemned.
Safety-schmafety.
I want profitability.
My name's Emma, and
this is my sister, Maddy.
Can we come in and play?
No way! You have no bodies.
Our castle is for body people only.
Fine.
We'll use our piranha
teeth and chew our way in!
Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh!
And this is what they mean when they say,
"There were warning signs."
Yeah. You sleep better if you don't watch.
Hey, what's wrong?
- You're hungry, babe?
- Starving.
She ever gonna feed me?
Hard to say. But don't worry.
Frankie's got you covered.
Dinner is served.
You want me to eat your
barf? That is revolting.
Revolting? No, girl. Regurgitation.
There's a big difference.
Whatever it's called, it looks nasty. Hmm!
Sorry, sweetie. I was just
trying to do somethin' nice.
I didn't mean to gross you out or nothin'.
Hmm. No sense letting this go to waste.
Oh, no!
Well, no sense letting that
go to waste either, right?
It's amazing how quickly
rock bottom sneaks up on you.
Psst! Precious!
What are you, vegan? This has no taste.
Hey, Frankie, what's that behind you?
Huh!
You want to see me catch it, don't you?
Hey, get back here. Get back here, you.
Help, help! They're eating everyone!
I'm gonna get ya. Oh! Oh!
- I'm gonna meet up with you. I'm gonna catch ya.
- Shh.
I'm gonna catch ya. I'm gonna
catch ya. Come on. Get back here.
Come on. Get back here.
Get back here. Hey.
Hey, what's goin' on?
Sorry, Frankie. You're not really my type.
I was just pretending to
like you to save my friends.
Pretending?
But together we're Frecious.
Come on.
Huh?
Aah!
Hop on!
Come on! Move it!
I'm a pug! I'm not built for
speed! Or power! Or looks!
She's shooting at us!
Giddyup. Yee-ha! Ride, ride, ride!
Stop kicking me! I'm not a horse!
Good idea, Buddy. Watch the rear.
When I catch you, your
heads are going on the wall!
I don't think that's an empty threat!
Hang on!
This is the worst rescue of all time!
Daddy!
What's all this ruckus? Hey, now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Gotcha!
Stop! Stop! Throw this puppy in reverse!
Get back here!
- Aah!
- Bottoms up!
- Ohh!
- Yee-ha!
Daddy, they're getting away!
Hold up. There's something I gotta do.
Come on! We gotta go!
Buddy, you worry too much.
Well, well, well. We meet again.
Hyah!
Little mayor!
It's squirrel season.
Whoa!
Ha! Is that all you got?
Buddy!
Buddy, no!
You got one!
Buddy!
No!
And stay out!
Andie.
It's Buddy.
Oh, no.
What happened?
He's hurt real bad.
Here, let me help you.
Oh, his chest is moving. That means he's
breathing. That's gotta be good, right?
It's all my fault. If I hadn't been
so reckless, he'd still be okay.
Let me get this straight.
Liberty Park is destroyed,
the backup park was a bust
and now Buddy's hurt too?
Yes, yes and yes.
Wow, I'm never right.
Now it happens three times in a
row, and I'm not even happy about it.
Hey, Buddy, remember when we...
we hid in that jack o' lantern
so we could steal Halloween
candy from the trick-or-treaters?
I didn't notice the candle
and my tail caught on fire.
Meanwhile, you got away
with two bags of candy.
Or that time we mailed
ourselves to the peanut factory.
You got there fine.
I got flagged as a suspicious package
and spent two weeks at the FBI.
It should have been me
who fell off that ledge.
You're the lucky one. You're
the one who always ends up okay.
- Hey, you need a break.
- I'm fine.
Tell me about Buddy.
How did you guys get to be so close?
I've known Buddy forever.
Met him the year of the hurricane.
The sky was a terrible color.
Never seen anything like it.
Surly!
Surly!
- Wow! That sure is a howler! Bad as I've ever seen!
- Oh, totally.
Then I saw him, the
tiniest little rat.
He couldn't have been
more than a few weeks old.
Oh, no! We have to help him!
It's too late! There's nothing we can do!
- No!
- Seal the door!
Wait! Ohh! I'm coming
for you, little buddy!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Little guy! Little buddy!
Aah!
Hang on!
Hang on!
You got it? You got it?
Get down!
That's when I blacked out.
I have no idea how he kept me alive.
He never spoke a word about it.
Or anything else.
When I woke up, he was there,
and he hasn't left my side ever since.
Can you believe this
goofball saved my life?
Sounds like you saved each other.
Bring it down nice and easy.
Okay, that's good.
Library Land?
Oh. That doesn't sound fun at all.
It says "Libertyland," you moron.
- You should have gone to Library Land when you was a kid.
- Ooh!
Tell your crew of illiterate
layabouts to hurry up!
Mr. Mayor, if we go any faster, we're
going to have to start cutting corners.
So cut 'em. I never liked corners.
I prefer rounded shapes myself.
And look at this ride.
Those are office chairs.
Kids love office chairs.
What if somebody gets hurt?
That is an excellent point.
I'm going to need you to make a sign with
large red letters that says, "No refunds!"
We've got to do something.
So do something.
We need you to come up with a plan.
Your plan is for me to come up with
a plan? Oh, that's a great plan.
News flash, Andie. My
crazy plans don't work.
Look what happened to Buddy.
Look at them, Surly.
They've lost the nut shop.
They've lost the park.
There's nothing to eat,
but they're still here.
Why do you think that is?
'Cause there's nowhere left to go.
They're here because of you.
They need something to believe in.
I need something to believe in.
What happens if he doesn't
wake up, Andie? Then what?
Hey, Buddy. I never got a chance
to say thanks for breaking me out.
Leave him alone.
I was just tryin' to say thanks.
Did... Did he just move?
Come on, Buddy. Wake up.
- Come back to me, Buddy!
- Surly.
- Lick him again!
- But...
- Do it!
- But you just said...
Who cares what I said. Just do it!
Come on. Come on.
Ha, ha! I knew it!
Even in a coma, nobody can stand
to have dog slobber on their face.
Hey, I resent that.
I've seen the places you lick.
Oh, touché.
Now hit him with everything you got.
Buddy.
I thought I lost you.
My licks are magical!
Hey, anybody else need one?
No, we're good.
I'm so sorry, Buddy.
I promise I'll never do
anything reckless again.
Don't turn over a new leaf just yet.
We still need to save the park.
What do you expect me to do? Lead us into
battle against the mayor and his goons?
Destroy all the rides and take back
Liberty Park by force? I mean, come on...
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Geez, guys, that's kind of lot of pressure.
You can do it, boss. It's all you.
No. It's not all me.
If we wanna stop these guys,
it's gonna take everyone.
Gather round. Let's make a plan.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.
What are you waiting for? Take my picture!
Oh, that kid's a monster.
Her and her dog both.
Hey, Frankie's nothing like her.
You've got no idea what he's been through.
Come on, Frankie. Move it!
Mr. Mayor, what do you say to allegations
that this amusement park is
an environmental catastrophe?
Well, I, uh... I, um...
No questions? All right,
well, then hit the switch.
"Lie Land"?
I-I'll get that fixed right away.
Nah, don't bother. No sense in
running up the electric bill.
- Mr. Mayor!
- Mr. Mayor!
Hey, what's going on?
Now, now, tonight is an exclusive
event for my campaign contributors.
You will be more than welcome to
buy your very own full-priced tickets
when it opens to the public.
Perfect timing.
Launch the aerial campaign!
Aah! My eyes!
That's the sign! That's the sign!
- Remember your training!
- You had training?
Waah!
Whoo-hoo!
I'm good to go! I'm good to go!
Aah!
I'm flyin'! I'm flyin'!
Ooof!
Time to eat my vegetables.
And by vegetables, I mean ketchup.
Huh?
Yahoo!
Yeah.
- White tuxedo.
- Target acquired.
When that clock hits 9:00, we attack.
That clock hasn't worked in 30 years.
What? Ahh! All right, fine.
Everyone go! Just forget
the clock! Just go!
Ahh! My white tuxedo!
Dive! Dive! Dive!
Get 'em! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Stop pecking me! Stop!
Ohh! Aah!
Drink up! Drink up!
Get it! Whack that mole!
Whack-a-mole? How
do you like it?
How do you like it?
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
The very existence of this game offends me.
Nice chewing, guys!
I want that squirrel's
head deep-fried on a stick!
- What are you doing?
- What?
Nobody likes a parking hog.
Ugh. Fine.
Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Aah!
Dad!
Spread out! Spread out, boys!
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Yeah. We're not gonna hurt you.
Punch it!
- Aha!
- Whoo!
It's Groundhog Day!
You are a terrible driver!
What do you expect? I'm a groundhog!
I need backup! I need backup!
- Ha, ha! I got him!
- Watch the road! Watch the road!
Ohh!
- What the...
- Let me go!
Got 'em. Six more weeks of winter.
Yeah, that's a groundhog joke.
Whoa! Ohh! Everybody take cover!
Come here, fuzzy little guys!
Where do you think you're going?
Buddy, stay behind me!
- Surly!
- Precious, look out!
No, let me go, you...
Precious!
No! Buddy!
No! Buddy!
Ah, got ya, you little critter.
Okay, boys.
Andie!
Andie, up here!
Surly, they've got everyone.
The groundhogs, Mole, even Buddy.
- We can't win this thing.
- Sure, we can.
No, Andie, we can't.
Not with only two of us.
But... we have to try.
Save yourself.
Surly, stop!
Find somewhere to hide!
Surly!
That's all of them, Mr. Mayor.
Ladies and gentlemen, get back
out there and have a good time.
I assure you that our little
rodent problem has been solved.
Aah!
I know you're out there! Come and get me!
Mr. Feng will be happy to see you.
Aah!
Get going! Move it!
You were a lot cuter
before you had a weapon.
You're a long way from
the park, little squirrel.
Yeah, you're in the city now.
Aah!
Ohh! Ahh! Ow! Ooh! Ohh!
I told you to stay out of the city.
You didn't listen.
Now you gonna pay.
I came to talk to you.
- Get rid of him.
- What's the problem?
You too cute to face me yourself?
Cute!
Never call me cute!
Yeah, yeah. Never call
you cute. I heard you.
But guess what. You are cute.
And no matter how many
times you kick me... Ohh!
Or punch me... Ohh!
It's not gonna change
the fact that you're cute.
You're an animal, and all animals are cute.
Well, with the exception of the
platypus. Those things are rough.
Why are you here?
I need your help to take back the park.
I don't care about your park.
I used to live in a park.
We all did.
We were peaceful and happy,
but people called us vermin.
They forced us out and turned
our home into a golf course.
We hid in the city
and vowed to transform
from cute and peaceful
to armed and dangerous.
We trained with the kung fu
masters of the Shaolin temple.
We grew strong and made sure our
home would never be in danger again.
Now I'm a city mouse, and I hate parks.
There's no such thing as a
city mouse or a park mouse.
We're all animals, and we need
to look out for each other.
Don't you see? They're doing the
same thing to us that they did to you.
This is your chance to do the right thing.
Enough!
You might as well do it,
because if you don't
help me save my friends,
I got nothing to live for.
Mm.
- Andie.
- She's awake.
Mm.
Is everyone here?
Everyone but Surly.
What happened to Surly?
He's probably got those animal control
creeps right where he wants them.
You're not gonna like where you're going.
What's going on? Where are they taking us?
We're all gonna die. Definitely gonna die.
Stop!
Hello, roadkill.
- Now!
- Charge!
Surly?
Before you get mad, just remember,
you're the one who wanted a crazy plan.
I'd like to you to meet
my new friend, Mr. Feng.
Oh, he's so cute!
That reminds me. Don't call him cute.
How did you convince a gang
of city mice to come help us?
We are not city mice. We are just mice.
A long time ago, Mr. Feng and his friends
were chased out of their homes too.
Nobody was there to stand up
for us, and we lost everything.
But Surly is right.
We are all animals, and
we are in this together.
Individually, we might be
tiny, but together we're giants.
- For the park!
- For the park!
Hey, how's it going?
There's so many of them!
Lift!
Wow! That was close.
Dig, dig, dig, dig. Run!
All right, Buddy, let her rip!
Yeah, Buddy!
That is what I'm talking about.
Hey, guys, there's more
of them over... Ohh!
Popcorn! Popcorn! Aah!
Oh!
Whoo-hoo!
Hey, Frankie.
Thought I'd stop by, see how you're doing.
I'm fine.
I also wanted to say that I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
I'm used to people treating me bad.
Nobody deserves to live like that.
You know, you don't need to
pretend to like me anymore.
Hey, I'm not pretending.
Then why'd you run out on me?
I don't regret running away, all right?
I regret not taking you with me.
You looked out for me. You're
a good guy with a good heart.
That's not something
I'm gonna walk away from.
Why should I trust you?
What...
Wh-What are you doing?
I'm trying to regurgitate
something for you.
Sorry. I haven't... eaten in a while.
Whoa, babe! You'd do that for me?
Like you said, together we're Frecious.
Knock them out.
With pleasure.
- Now!
- Look out!
No, no, no! Precious!
I'm fine. It only hit my collar.
Go! Go! Go!
This is crazy! You literally
took a bullet for me.
That's like true love!
- I guess it is.
- Take the shot!
Bye-bye, little doggies.
- Help!
- What are you doing? They're getting away!
Ow! Tiny teeth are so sharp!
Do I have to do everything myself?
Ooh.
Stop touching me! What
do you have against me?
Not so defenseless now, are we?
Andie, turn him this way! Buddy, fire!
- Nice shot!
- You shot me with a dart?
Ooh, ooh. Not good.
I don't feel so good.
Uhh.
Ahh. Whoo-hoo!
Hello, doggies.
Heather, sit!
Whoa! Play dead!
Man, I'm good at this. I should get a dog.
It's coming right for us!
Take cover!
Whoa!
Hey! Hey, stop!
No!
Stand up!
All together! Right. Left.
Right. Left. Right. Left.
Whoa, Dwayne, are you okay?
Get him!
Flying fist!
Look out!
Get down!
Don't mess with the little guy.
I'm not getting paid enough for this!
No, you can't leave!
Stop! Stop! I order you!
Stop right there.
Oh! Please accept my formal resignation.
Hmm?
Mmm! Ohh!
That is a lot of sugar for a little guy.
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Aah! Ha! Ha! Ha!
No!
No!
Yikes.
That has got to be a safety violation.
Whoever's in charge of
this place is going to jail.
Whoo. I would hate to be that guy.
Ha!
So long, suckers!
I hear Canada is nice this time of year.
You're not getting away that easy!
Ta-ta!
Huh?
Aah!
He's getting away!
Buddy, we don't have time for rides!
Please keep your arms and legs
inside the ride at all times.
If an arm or leg becomes detached, you
can pick it up at the lost and found.
And remember: no refunds!
The balloon! Buddy, you're a genius!
Maybe we should put the safety bar down.
Safety bars are overrated.
Humans actually like this?
Whoa!
Aah!
It's too far! We're not gonna make it!
Good idea, Buddy. We
only got one shot at this.
Aah! Aah! Here we go! Here we go!
Three, two, one... now!
Aah!
Oh, I'm going to mount
your head on my wall.
Time to take down this sack of hot air.
I should've exterminated
you when I had the chance.
All right, time to take
down this sack of hot air.
You destroyed Libertyland.
And now you're going down.
Aah! Aah! Get off! Get off me!
Whoa!
It's times like this I wish I had rabies.
Get off! Get off!
Whoa! Aah!
Where is he? Where'd he go?
- Howdy!
- Aah!
Oh, this is gonna be fun.
Whoa!
- Surly!
- Andie!
Uhh! Ohh!
Whoo. My taxidermist is
gonna have quite the job
putting you back together again.
Ohh!
Huh?
What-What the...
This one's for Buddy!
Whoa!
- I'm okay!
- Attack!
Aah! Aah! Help! Help!
Help! I'm not okay! Help!
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!
Wow. Those guys are hungry.
Use your teeth, fellas! Get in there!
Mr. Mayor, you're coming with me.
Oh!
Sarge, we're gonna take this
into evidence. Code seven.
Copy that, rookie.
Get your hands off of
me! Do you know who I am?
You, sir, are going to
jail for a long time.
Help! I can't go to jail! I'm rich!
Get your hands off me!
Do you know who I am?
Aah!
You. You shot me with a dart!
Please, please, let me explain.
Help! Help! Somebody call the police!
Her tiny teeth are so sharp! Ow! Ow!
This amusement park is closed!
Way to go, Surly!
Hey, where's Andie?
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Way to go, Andie!
Yay, Andie!
- Whoa.
- Yay, Andie!
Way to go, Andie!
Way to go, guys! We did it!
Ugh! Buddy!
Ugh! Precious, no licking.
We talked about this.
Ohh! Come on, man, we just met.
Ohh!
Great. Two slobber monsters.
The mayor is gone! The rides
are destroyed! We're all gonna...
live!
It took a lot of clean up
to get rid of Libertyland,
but everyone in town pitched in.
Turns out, some humans
aren't half bad.
Sure, they're ugly and they've got
no fur, but they're not half bad.
So I bet you're wondering if I learned
some huge lesson from all this.
- Nope. I'm happy to say I didn't learn a thing.
- Surly.
Okay, fine. I learned that
we're better together.
We put aside our differences and work
as a team, there's nothing we can't do.
Mr. Feng and his friends
moved into the park
and started exploring
more peaceful pursuits.
Tai chi. It's like fighting in slow motion.
Tough!
And cute.
Oh, and one more thing.
I learned to appreciate what
was right in front of me.
Uhh!
All right, all right,
stop lickin' Uncle Surly.
I am so sorry. I don't
know what got into them.
But, Dad, you said it's a
dog's job to chase squirrels.
Frankie, what are you teaching these kids?
Hey, I'm teaching them the skills they need
to be competitive in the dog marketplace.
Come on, pups. Let's
go mark some territory.
You know, Andie, you were right.
I'm so happy we're back in the park,
living off the land like nature intended.
I can honestly say I'm a changed squirrel.
Well, that's great, Surly, because I...
What is that smell?
It's... a nut cart.
Please! Please! I promise
I'll only take one bag.
Better make it two.
Because I am not sharing.
Yes!
This is why I love you!
Let's get nuts.
- Hyah!
- Whoo-hoo!
Ride, Precious, ride! Hyah!
Aah!
Ow, ow!
Witness the power of my
1/16th-of-an-inch punch.
Aw, that's cute.
- Can we do it one more time? That one didn't feel right.
- Cut.
- Take 28.
- Aw, that's cute.
- Ah-choo! Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Cut.
Take 44.
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Just too funny. Ha, ha, ha.
Can we try one without the punch?
I said, don't call me cute.
Get them! Do-do-do-do-do.
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Aah! You are going to face
the furry of my... Aah!
