Brad!
Brad!
Hello?!
Lucas?!
Okay.
Hey.
Brad. Brad.
Hey, it's Jenn. Hey.
Hi. I-I'm gonna help you, okay?
Shit.
Okay. Okay, just...
Oh, f...
Help!
Somebody help!
Okay.
Okay.
- Jenn.
- Hey.
Did you see it?
What?
I need to find you water.
Water...
Here.
Brad.
Brad.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Hello?
Shit.
Ugh.
Oh, my God.
Jesus.
Come back!
Hey, come back!
Please, please.
No, no...
No!
Oh, shit!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Oh, shit.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
We're here now.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
God, this place is beautiful.
- It's a miracle.
- It's incredible.
Mmm. How is there soda here?
There was a family here
a long time ago,
and they left a bunch of stuff.
Mmm.
Mmm.
So, whenever you guys are ready,
we should get out of here.
Uh... back on the raft?
It isn't safe here.
There's...
...an animal...
Sweetheart, I'm sure
there's a lot of animals.
It's a monster.
Okay, I saw it.
It crawled out of the ocean
and it walks on land,
and it drags its food
back out to this...
There's a, there's a black hole
out there.
Okay? Zack washed up.
He was already dead,
and I saw it
drag him out there.
Okay. The family that-that
I was telling you about...
Look at this.
- What is this?
- Do you see that?
Th... Those are,
those are his eyes.
- It killed them.
- How could you know that?
Because I found their graves.
They were buried here.
Well, then what happened to
the person who dug the graves?
Now... Okay.
Well, there's clearly a current
pulling things
towards the island.
All right?
We all washed up here.
I say we wait, we'll see
if anyone else arrives.
Same. What if Brad shows up?
Brad's dead.
Brad's dead?
Yeah.
Oh, fuck...
I'm sorry, I...
What happened to him?
Okay, I buried him.
I buried him deep into the
ground and this creature came
and dug him up.
What does this thing look like?
It's massive.
It-it has two sets of eyes,
and it smells.
Look, I-I got it last night.
Okay? That's black blood.
Was he, was he in pain?
Mia, he knew
that he wasn't alone.
He knew that
I was there with him.
You still love that sound?
I guess everyone does.
Don't think I'll be coming
to the beach much after this.
You know, out on the raft,
for the first time in my life,
I thought I was gonna die.
I really thought that...
that that was it.
A-And it's funny because
all I was thinking about
is how embarrassing it would be.
Everyone back home's
just waiting for me to fail.
Out on the raft,
you don't hear waves.
You don't hear anything.
I'd rather die on the raft
than this place.
You don't know
what it's like out there.
So, we're gonna head west.
I saw a bunch of planes
go that way.
I'm pretty sure they'll see us.
Okay, hey.
- I know this all sounds crazy.
- Yeah.
I really need you to believe me.
I do.
It's just a lot
to process, all right?
I mean, we just need
a little bit of time, okay?
I'm gonna get more food.
We should bring
as much as we can.
Can I borrow this?
Thanks.
Hey, make sure she gets ready.
Okay, there's enough for a week.
We got to be smart
with what we have.
All right,
let's load up the raft.
Jenn.
We're not leaving.
- What?
- Not right now.
- Not in our condition.
- We can't do it.
I understand that you're tired.
Guys, I'm tired, too.
I'm exhausted, but...
We're not just tired.
We're weak.
All right, we've barely eaten.
- Just need to rest up, all right?
- No, you don't rest here.
Jenn, you've been alone
and you're scared,
and I get that.
But whatever you've been seeing,
this animal...
- It's not an animal! I told you that!
- Hey, okay, listen to me,
there's nothing for miles, Jenn.
Okay? I-I say
we light a huge fire.
Y-You said there
are planes, right?
We'll-we'll light a fire
and they'll see us.
It's getting dark.
Get ready to leave.
Sweetheart, are you even
listening to me?
We are not getting
on that fucking raft!
Just not tonight, all right?
We'll figure this out.
Okay.
Lucas.
Hey! Jenn!
Hey!
Stop it!
Stop! Jenn! Wait!
Hey! Stop!
- Get off me!
- Calm down.
- Let go of me! I'm leaving!
- Stop! Stop!
Stop. Just stop.
No!
Hey!
Hey.
- I'm leaving, I don't care!
- Calm down!
I don't care! No!
Stop!
Hey.
Shh. It's okay.
Where is Lucas?
He's just taking a look around.
Don't worry, it's been dark
for a few hours,
and we haven't seen anything.
You had to tie me up?
I think just for now.
I'm sorry.
Really, I... I shouldn't have
hit you like that.
I just... I didn't know
what else to do.
Yeah, I don't care.
Just...
untie me.
I think we've all been
through something traumatic,
and we're all just trying
to cope with it in our own
different ways.
I'm just as guilty, I am.
Guilty? Who's guilty?
I didn't make this up.
I'm not lying to you.
Right.
Like when you got mugged
before we left.
Jenn, it's not that
I don't believe you.
It's just that, over the years,
you've made it pretty hard
for me to believe you.
This is a little different.
I just want what's best
for everyone.
I really don't need you
to tell me what's best for me.
I didn't see anything.
There's nothing out there.
'Cause it doesn't come
from the trees.
I just want you to feel safe.
We're all just trying
to figure this out.
Figure it out?
- Yes, figure it out.
- We need to
get away from this place
as soon as possible.
Do you want me to give
you guys a second?
- Okay.
- Thank you.
She's really sorry
about what happened...
Yeah, she mentioned it.
Lucas, untie me.
Not until you promise me
you'll relax.
You all right?
I just want to make sure
that you're okay.
You're fine.
There's always a black cloud
hanging over your head.
You know that, right?
This whole thing, Jenn.
It's so crazy.
I was having a great time
all week.
On a boat with my friends,
weather was perfect.
Brought you
on this incredible trip.
Everyone's having a great time,
except you, right?
And the night you come up
to tell me
that you might not be happy,
that you maybe don't want
to be in this...
...storm clouds roll in.
How perfect is that?
No matter where you go,
there's always a storm
right behind you.
Lucas, you know I love you,
but this is not the time
to talk about this.
Let me go.
So, what were you gonna do?
- What was your plan, exactly?
- I told you.
- Head west.
- No, I get that.
But you head west, you get found
and brought back home.
And then what?
You've got no one else.
Where you gonna live?
You gonna go back to school?
And afford it how?
I pay for your life.
And you pay me back
by taking the raft
and leaving me here
to starve to death?
You don't starve here.
That's not what happens.
You get torn into pieces
and dragged into a hole
in the middle of the ocean.
That's what happens here.
Mia thinks you're starting
to sound a lot like Zack.
What happened to Zack?
Lucas.
Shit.
Lucas!
Run. Now.
Are you sure?
I've never seen it
during the day.
There's nothing
you could have done.
Give me a hand?
I'm gonna see
if there's anything else
we might need
from the old campsite.
All right.
Climb in.
Shit!
It grabbed me.
Help me!
Shit!
Aah!
You said it wouldn't come out
during the...
I'm writing this letter
hoping it serves
as some sort of proof.
A little more than a week ago,
my boat went down in a storm,
and I've been surviving
on this island since.
Zack and Brad from our group
are both dead.
Brad washed ashore
with me already injured
and died shortly after.
Days later,
Zack washed ashore,
already dead.
I never knew their last names.
Shit.
Mia Reed and my boyfriend,
Lucas Griffin,
arrived on a raft
a few days after.
And they were both killed
by a monster
that lives
just off this island.
And there's nothing I can do
to prove that.
For a lot of my life, I've
struggled with being believed.
The truth doesn't always come
with a receipt.
Sometimes all we have
is our word.
There's no way for me
to show you
the things that I can tell you.
That there's a monster here
taller than any man
I've ever seen,
twice as fast in water
as it is on land,
and it bleeds black blood.
For a week I've run from it
and hid from it,
but not anymore.
If you find this note, what's
left of my body will either
be on this island or deep
in a hole off the west shore.
I hope this letter is enough
for you to believe my story.
