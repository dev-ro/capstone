Who?
A'la?
- Just hurry up Mr. Arab
- What's wrong?
A'la cut his vein, search me
It's okay, go
A'la!
Hey, A'la!
Get up, what is it A'la?
A'la!
I'm talking to you
What?
Here's to the honor of Akbar
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Come and blow out the candles
One two three
Careful not to waste any of the cake
Get back pal
Get away
The cake got ruined
Eat it with bread to get full
Bread
Akbar!
Akbar!
Hold on, what happened Akbar?
What's with you Akbar?
Hold on Akbar
What's with you?
Go to the office
Get out
Come here
What?
Nothing sir
Solitary
Why are you hitting me?
Just so you invite me the next time
you throw a party
I just wanted him to have some fun
before he's sent to the adult section
So you're the one to give fun
to all those who are having fun
Let it go
- Two days in solitary
- I won't go
You won't? I'll beat you up
- Piece of shit
- Knock it off
- Shut up
- Be nice
- Throw him in solitary
- Okay
- Throw him there
- I will, you go
Come
You asked for it
I'll beat the living shit out of him
the minute I step out of here
- No you won't
- He is not logical
You don't seem to
understand what you did today
What did I do?
I had a festivity, is that a crime?
Who are you to remind that poor soul
it's his eighteenth birthday today?
- He's my friend
- Is that how you show friendship?
I just wanted to make him happy
- So why didn't he get happy?
- I don't know
But I know
He's eighteen years old fix today
Meaning it's time for his execution
Got it now?
Take him
Jump up
Don't you panic
I have a feeling the guy
will finally give his consent
Just be careful
Adults' section is different than here
You won't get close to anyone there
And you'll leave everyone alone
Just be yourself, got that?
Okay
And if you're released and come
back here empty-handed. . .
I'll throw your ass in solitary for a week
You're leaving early today
I'm going to see the boy's complainant
Aren't you tired yet?
It's the last time
There might be hope yet
You're only disrespecting yourself
That fellow won't give an inch
It won't hurt to go though
Remember what I told you two years ago?
I said if we meet that
fellow ten years later. . .
If we beg him, and preach him. . .
He'll still want capital punishment
Now you believe me?
I would have let go if it were
anyone else besides Akbar
But that kid doesn't deserve to be executed
Two and two is four
You'll have to be executed
if you kill someone
This is called justice
and the rest is bullshit
Bring something on the way back
A'la has cut himself and
is dying Mr. Ghafourian
Where is he now?
In the toilets
They're coming
Hit me
Come on do an '' X ''
Hold it right
Cut me you idiot before he comes
don't worry, do it
Go on
Goddamn you piece of shit
I got here a bit eary didn't I?
How did you kill your father coward?
He's killing everyone
Cutie
Get out of here
Why did you want to cut yourself?
So we take you to the hospital
and you can escape from there
How stupid do you think we are
not to know what goes on in your heads. . .
After four years of dealing with prisoners?
I want to get out of here
What's going on out there?
Your wife and children are waiting for you?
Or your parents?
I have things to do
Have you found new work?
Or the same shit and stealing?
I'll run away from here
Go on
Do it
I want to do it for Akbar
To do what?
To get his consent
No way
I'll do it
I've done everything I wanted
to do in this world
Thanks a lot
You'll go and mess things up
worse than they already are
What are they going to
do if things get worse?
Will they execute him twice?
This isn't your responsibility
Whose is it then? You?
How come you haven't been able
to do it then?
I would have done it if it were
possible you idiot
I'll do it
I'll stick to him in twenty four hours
and get his consent
I'm a bastard if I don't get it
Do it when your time is up
He'll be executed by then
I have to go now
It's out of my hands
Go in the ward
And you do things like that once more
and you'll find yourself in solitary
Now
How much more is left of your jail time?
Twenty eight days
I would have been able to help you
if you had good diciplinary things
But you're always either
fighting or hitting yourself
My record is black anyway
But Akbar's is full of good things
For him
Get your hand off
I swear if I get out of here
and get consent. . .
I'll be back by myself. . .
And I'll spend two months instead
of twenty eight days
In order for the first good diciplinary
report to go in your record. . .
You'll bring my that cutter right now
Sure thing sir
Get lost
You've changed
I even did my morning prayers
How many times?
I said how many times?
I prayed for all the days I haven't
Did you shower before it?
Did you see these photos?
Animals
Can I go now? Is it done?
You'll bring the rest tomorrow
I swear there is no more sir
You shouldn't lie when you pray
There are more
- Sure sir, I'll bring them
- That's it
Bring his file
let's see if there's anything we can do
Put a couple of good behavoir
reports in there as well
Never mind that
He only has about a month left
of his time anyway
If he were going to change. . .
He would have done so
during the past couple of years
Besides the twenty some days left
of his time is for extra punishment
You know his fines
A'la Pour Salehi
A'la Pour Salehi
Get your belongings and come to the office
Pour Salehi to the office
Do you see that blue window?
That's Akbar's sister's house
You'll talk to her
And you'll go to the old man's house together
You'll mess things up if you go alone
Remember not to talk shit when you go there
And don't get into a fight
Be nice
Get out
Who do you want to see?
Who do you want to talk to?
What's it to you?
I said who are you here to see
in this house? Don't be smart
With my friend's sister
- Akbar?
- Is she here?
- No
- When will she be back?
There's no telling
Tell me, I'll give her the message
I have to tell her
She's out
Give me a cold drink
Do you want some?
Don't drink it kid
Give it to me
You're a bit sick aren't you?
Get out of here
don't cause trouble
Why did you bring the kid here again?
What do you want keep knocking?
Get in the house
You're stupid to bring the kid out
here in the dust and mud
- Yeah I'm stupid
- You'll eventually kill the kid
- Are you Akbar's sister?
- Get out of here
What do you want?
I was with Akbar, in the rehab
- Didn't I tell you. . .
- None of your business
Do you have to bark at anyone
passing by here?
- You're the dog
- Get in the house
Shut your mouth
- Is he your husband?
- Never mind
What's new with Akbar?
Is he alright?
Yeah
He's just scared
Why?
It's time for his execution
Easy baby, let me see what I can do
When are they going to hang him?
Not much longer
He begged for you to go and get
the complainant's consent somehow
He won't
I've tried it a thousand times during
the past two years
I cried, I begged him
I begged him
The last time I bent down to kiss his hand
He punched me in the head
I've had a headache for a month now
I'm embarrassed to go and visit Akbar
How can I keep lying to him?
Doesn't Akbar have anyone else but you?
Like who?
We wouldn't be in this mess
if we had anyone watching over us
As far as me too
It's no difference if I go or not to go
So you don't want to do anything for him?
Like what?
How much more can I drage the baby. . .
And go and keep getting
beat up and cursed out?
Maybe he wants money
No he doesn't
Besides I don't have any
even if he wants money?
Get out of here pal
Don't come around here anymore
Leave her alone
Stop there
What did you get from that addict?
Pardon?
Sorry ma'am, do you know him?
He's a relative
Can you bring us some water?
Give him his bag and let him go
- Is there something wrong sir?
- No, it's nothing
- How about a drink?
- Is it cold?
Come here, it's cold
A stranger coming in this neighborhood
means he's here to buy drugs
Come in and wash up
No, just give me some water
Where is Akbar now?
I'll find out for you
No
Just don't tell him you saw
me if you go to visit him
I won't go to see him until
I get the consent for him
- You want to go and meet his complainant?
- Yeah
Do you have his address?
I'll get it from the rehab
We'll go together then
When should I come?
I'm home till noon everyday
then I go to work
Stand over that line when you come
- I'll see you from my room
- Okay
Does your husband sell envelops too?
- No
- Bye
Who is it?
Here's the key
- You're leaving early
- I have things to do
Give me an envelop
And pain killers the rest
You still haven't gone to see a doctor yet
Sorry I'm late
It's alright
- I'll bring this
- Thanks
Watch the other way
Take this
And this too
Walk him a bit if he starts to cry
Give this to me too
Don't you want me to come in?
Let me go in this time
- Hello
- Hello
- Is your husband home?
- No he's out
For God's sake
Do you know how far I've come
here in this heat with this kid?
You're gonna be ruded out again
Haven't you had enough?
Let him do it if it makes him feel better
Can't blame him
Let me come in for God's sake
Let me see what I can do
Why are you upset?
Why did I come here then?
To babysit?
You don't know him yet
He'll get pissed off if it's the two of us
But I'm a woman and alone
He'll take it under consideration
I'll call you if he's in a good mood
What can I do?
He doesn't want you in
You let me come in, tell him I forced my way
You come and go but I have
to bear his bad attitude for two days
Please, I won't come anymore
He'll give consent today hopefully
and you won't ever see me
- His got a patient in the room
- Please, I'll wait till she leaves
He's not in a good mood at all today
He went to the cemetery
I'm so sorry, let me come in
Just two minutes
I'll leave soon
- Don't tell him I let you in then
- Okay, don't worry
Gather this up or I'll throw it out
There is a Qoran on it
Will you throw that out too?
Let me talk to you for a moment
I have to go out
Mr. Abolqasem!
Pick this up and then talk
Mr. Abolqasem!
Akbar turned eighteen
They took him to the death row
He's not the same boy you saw
two years ago in the court
He's gotten old, he's a corpse
He's a bag of bones
He's gotten tortured as much
as ten executions during the past two years
I would have brought him personally
if he had the nerve to do it
You'd have given consent
There's no time left Mr. Abolqasem
They'll hang him if you don't give consent
Was that all?
I don't have anyone else besides him
All my hope is for him to come
out in five or ten years. . .
And to take care of me
Don't waste your breath
I won't forget my girl's death
I swear to God Maliheh wouldn't
be happy about Akbar's death neither
Don't use my girl's name
Who let you in here?
Do you belong to this house?
- Hello
- Hi
Give me your hand
The baby is hungry
Tell her mother to come out and feed her
The milk she'll give the baby now
is more like poison to him
What do I do then?
Give him to me
Someone help me
Shame on you, she's a woman
Did he hit you?
Why are you lying?
I saw him throw you out
What are you gonna do?
He's got no right to raise
his hand on a woman
Come on out if you dare to
Come on out you. . .
Quiet
Get back
I told you to get back
Where is my baby?
Didn't they give him to you?
He notices all the animals in the forest. . .
To have a party for him
The deer becomes happy
I have to take him dear
That's the end of our story
But not the end of all stories
Come
You wanted an evelop
You want to write a letter
to your girlfriend?
Doesn't she have a phone?
She's worthless if she doesn't have a phone
Specially for someone who's in prison
If I told you not to come in. . .
It's because I knew that's
how it would turn out to be
I'm willing to do anything for Akbar
To belittle myself
To be cursed, and to beg
And to lie
But I don't want anyone to see me that way
Stop in front of the hospital mister
- Fare for two
- No just one
No the two
Pay attention
Act like I don't know what you want here
He'll put me through hell if he finds out
Why isn't he coming then?
He's washing up
- Who is it?
- I think it's a patient
Hello Haji, how are you?
Hello son, sit down
Sorry it's a bad time
Would you like to do your prayers first. . .
I'll bother you later then
I'll pray at the mosque
Sit down
Come closer
What's the matter?
What is your sickness son?
Nothing
Why are you here then?
I have a letter for you
Where from?
Someone who told me
to make sure you get it
Who?
You'll know when you read it
Should I read it to you?
Go on
In the name of God
Hello Mr. Abolqasem Rahmati
Now that I'm writing this letter to you. . .
I've turned eighteen and. . .
I'll be executed in a little while
I know hearing this. . .
Is difficult for you
But I didn't want to kill your loved one
I meant to kill her and me both
I was supposed to kill myself first
But Maliheh said that if I killed myself. . .
She's kill herself too
You loved her a lot
Maliheh had told me about it a few times
But I want you to know. . .
That no one loved her as much as I did
And she didn't love anyone more
than me after you of course
I don't mean to ask you
To give consent so I won't be executed
I wanted to be executed two years ago
But I don't deserve to be executed
It's not all my fault
Remember how you beat her up
once in front of me
The pleasure you find in venges. . .
I mean in forgiveness you won't
find in taking revenge
May God accept it
May God accept it Haji
Just give me an ear while you're praying
I understand you
You lost a dear one, and you're angry
And you think you'll feel
better once he's executed
But I swear to God you won't
I swear to Quran if anything changes
You'll be the first one to feel bad
once he's executed
Do you believe in the very God
you're praying to now?
Refer him to God
Doesn't he deserve to die?
God knows it better than you and me
what's right and what's wrong
He'll do such a number on him
worse than a hundred executions
For instance, once he steps out of jail. . .
He'll get run over by a car
It's nothing for God
He'll take care of it
But if you don't believe me. . .
That means you have doubts in God
Besides there is a difference
Your girl didn't know she was going to die
It was over in a moment
But my friend knows he's supposed to die
For two years
Until he's hanged. . .
He'll die a hundred times a night
Now is that the same?
You be the judge of that
Hold on Haji
I want to talk to you
Even if my own brother
had committed murder. . .
I wouldn't have left everything. . .
To go and get consent for him
But Akbar doesn't deserve execution
So I won't give up until I get your consent
I'll be on you night and day
Now it's up to you
Okay go on for now
Until I think it over
Thanks a lot Haji
Where did she go again?
My pretty baby
Mother's baby
- Hi
- Hi
Abolqasem isn't in
I don't want to come in
Here you are
Why do you keep spending money girl?
No matter how much I spent
it's not enough for you
These are nothing
Thank God Mr. Abolqasem's gotten a bit soft
Says who?
He told me last night
He went to the court this morning
To give consent?
Didn't he say anything to you?
Execution is his final word
Last night he'd gotten a bit soft
He didn't curse out nor did he beat me
He listened to everything I told him
How dare did he go to the court?
I'm not a kid to play me!
I'm tired anymore
Do whatever you want to
Come in and see him yourself
Don't worry
File a complaint and they'll take care of it
For as long as they have hopes to
get my consent. . .
They won't let up on me
So are you going to give consent?
How can I? He killed my girl
Why are you here then?
I'm here to see if there's anything
I can do to speed things up
And for them to stop hoping
You waited for two years
and you can wait a bit longer
They'll execute him
But I'm fed up with them coming and going
Well just as much as you loved your girl. . .
They love the boy too
You can't blame them for trying
To stop their boy to be executed
What can I do for them to realize
I won't be giving my consent?
If you don't want the
execution to be postponed. . .
Go after coming up with the blood money
I told you I don't have any money
But you have to pay the difference
between a man and woman's blood money
He killed my girl. . .
But I have to pay so he's executed?
The victim is a woman and
the murderer is a man
The blood money of the victim
is half of the one of the murderer
I'd told you this before
So my girl's life is worth half
of that bastard's life?
According to the law the blood money
of a Muslem woman. . .
Is half of a Muslem man
Are you a Muslem or not?
I sure am
I believe in the same God
and prophet that you do
This is the laws of Islam
And the law says anyone
who's loved one is killed. . .
Has to pay a couple of millions
so you could execute the murderer?
Or is that what you say?
This money isn't going in my pocket. . .
Or to the government
It goes to the murderer's family
And I don't have time to explain
the logic behind it
Is there any logic to this anyway?
The same religion you believe in. . .
It is hasty when it comes to someone
being killed. . .
And for another person to be
killed because of it
So it's put barriers on your way. . .
So you would forgive
I won't
You will God willingly
It's more of a good deed
One thing us poor people have a lot
in this world. . .
Is doing good deeds sir
So think about preparing the blood money
- Bye
- Take care
Mister!
Are you his relative?
No I'm his friend
Akbar's friend
Do they have anyone to pay money for them?
What money?
For consent
I thought you said your husband
won't give consent
What if I persuade him?
Do they have anyone with money?
How much?
Enough to cure my daughter
From what I gathered from your husband
he won't give consent even with money
He only listens to one person
I'll to him
He'll make him give his consent
even if it's for the cure. . .
Of my daughter
Who?
The praying leader of the mosque
You have to stand up to him
You're the one who has to forgive
A mother is more righteous than a father
I mean she was your child too
And say you want to forgive
Maliheh wasn't my daughter
She was the only memory
of his late first wife
You can't blame him for not forgiving
Just don't let him find out I talked to you
And if they gather enough money. . .
Let me know
You haven't had lunch have you?
I had
Okay eat this too
It'll be your dinner
How do you know?
Where do you stay at night?
In my mother's house in Niavaran
Funny!
When will you be done work?
Why?
Let's go to get consent
His wife said she'll force him to accept
it if we come up with money
Tell your mother in Niavaran
to loan a couple of millions
It's possible to come up with the money
if they don't want it all at once
How?
We'll come up with it
Why were you in the rehab?
For robbery
When should I come to pick you up?
I'm here tonight
So tomorrow
- Are you full now?
- Not really
Yes Haji?
I looked the Quran for you
You did?
Your wife told me to ask God
for advice for you
What for?
For your problem
Sit down
My wife came to you without telling me
I don't need advice
Everyone needs advice
when you are in doubt
And what better advice than God's?
But I'm not in doubt
Sit down anyway
Here
[ reading the Quran ]
Anyone of you did something bad. . .
And if he repents and corrects himself. . .
And of course God is
merciful and compassionate
This holy verse. . .
Doesn't precisely tell you what to do
But it's talking about mercy and forgiveness
I have a question Haji
Hasn't the Quran given me the right
to ask for revenge?
Doesn't it say murderers
should pay for their acts?
Haven't I been subjected to injustice?
So why does it keep putting
barriers in my way?
It's as if I've done something wrong
And I'm the oppressor
I swear to the prophet there is no one
else more oppressed than I am
Don't say something you might regret later
I won't forgive
But God's happy if you do
In that case God isn't just then
Don't talk blasfemous
I'm not
But I'm upset with God too
We the residents of Shams Abad. . .
The businessmen. . .
The people of the mosque area. . .
The workers of the textile factory. . .
Testify that. . .
Mr. Abolqasem Rahmati. . .
The son of Karim
The father of the victim. . .
And the fired worker. . .
Is ill. . .
And in poverty
And doesn't have the power. . .
To pay for the blood money. . .
Thus we are asking. . .
For him to reach justice. . .
For this amount. . .
To be paid by the government
And the verdict
And the execution of the murderer
To be carried out
I took her to the doctor yesterday
He went over the tests
He said she can be operated on
Scratch out the fired worker part
But he said once she's older. . .
The operation will be harder
It's too late already
I want to do the surgery
How much is it?
There are a couple of operations
He said about four million tomans
Or perhaps less
Write small so there will be enough
room for a lot of signatures
Listen to me
If I had that kind of a money. . .
I'd pay the blood money to take
revenge for my daughter
We won't pay anything
Instead of executing the boy. . .
You can get the money from them
Rewrite it
Let me see you
I would have thrown him under
the train if he weren't your husband
Was I wrong for hitting him?
No, you were right!
Why did you take my side
if I did the wrong thing?
You're my brother's friend
Well he is your husband
I'll take his side the next time
All the injustice to the God's prophet
All the problems caused for the
leader of the Muslems
But he forgave
What's the first verse of the Holy Quran?
It goes
In the name of God
That's right
In the name of God
Our religion is the right religion
Why doesn't it say
In the name of the Angry God?
It says the Compassionate God
Well that tells us something
Read the Holy Quran
Read it
So many verses about mercifullness
and forgiveness
Humans are the top of the creation
And humans are valuable
since they're God's creations
Any kindness we do to any other
human beings. . .
Means we've done so to God
Peace be upon prophet Mohammad
[ singing a song to the child ]
Hi
What happened Haji?
I told you sister
I can't do anything if you're in a hurry
Sure, anything you say
You can't blame him anyway
He feels if he gives consent. . .
- He's made a deal over his girl's life
- Hello Haji
- Hello
- So he doesn't agree?
It's not something you do in a day or two
It takes time
But there is no time left Haji
They're going to hang my brother
You get the blood money as soon as you can
I'll persuade him
Really?
I'll do it
Goodbye
What is your name?
Tell me your name
A'la
Tell me it doesn't suit me
What?
Tell me what your mother. . .
In uptown, what does she call you?
They all call me A'la
They call me Andy
Tell him to be serious
Ask him where his house is?
Shahr-e-Ziba
Ask him how old he is
I'm younger than you are
A couple of years
How old are you?
Tell him a year old
I'm talking about you
Does it matter?
No
But you're older than me
Do you what I thought the first
time I saw you?
I thought you were about twenty three
What about now?
Now. . .
I think about thirty two
I don't want to
It's too much
Eat it, don't be shy
What is it?
Nothing
Can I take a smoke?
- No
- Why not?
I don't like the women who smoke
But I like it
How much pal?
Be my guest
Three thousand and three hundred
Hold on
I'll take you
No I'll go by myself
Will you come tomorrow?
When should I come?
Sooner
In the morning
What?
At the hospital yesterday. . .
Why did you ask me the reason
I went to the rehab?
No reason
You asked for Akbar's money
I have to come up with that money
I can do it
You hate women who smoke. . .
And I hate men who are thieves
And keep stealing
They're constantly in and out of prison
Why haven't you gone to work yet?
I'm tired
Take this
I quit
There they come again
Take these inside Firouzeh
I'm talking to you
They'll arrest me
- Hello officer
- Shut the place down
I swear I'm working legal here
close it down
Where are you taking me?
Let go of my hand
I swear I'm been here for three years
The guy wants to move to Tehran
His money is honest
Is it cash?
It's enough cash to solve your problem
I'll guarantee him
He's a friend
He'll pay the rest bit by bit
I know him
I've found a place for you too
The rent is not much
and you can handle it
Forget the building
you have to price the land
Should we write up the contract?
- Sure
- Here you are
Does it have city gas?
The plumbing is done
It'll be connected anytime now
- Here you go
- Thanks
What's wrong ma'am?
Go to the clergy in the mosque. . .
Tell him Abolqasem is selling his house
Bring him over
Like I said before. . .
It's up to him
He's not a kid
You can't force him
Legally he's got the right to anyway
He can ask for execution
What do you mean?
Is it right for him to ruin his family?
To pay the blood money to execute
his child's murderer?
Are you worried for his family
or thinking of your friend?
It's to his advantage too
Instead of the execution he'll
get some money to cure that girl
This is a better of a good deed
Since when you can decide on what's good?
You aren't entitled to decide
what's good and what's not
Why?
A five year old child can distinguish
between the two
Yes, this way a life is saved
But the society is not safe
[ reading the Holy Quran ]
Do you know if an unwanted
person is executed. . .
How big of a good deed it is to others?
What unwanted?
My friend is a very nice boy
How did he commit murder then?
He was young and stupid, only sixteen
He was in love and blind I
He was going to kill himself too
I have to pray first anyway
You do the same for now
He'll sell the house if we don't rush there
He won't give consent if
he puts the blood money together
- What do you suggest me do?
- Go now if possible
- Hello
- Hello
The people are waiting for me
- Is praying more important
than saving a life?
- Yes it is
I'll send someone to bring him here
Come to the agency and
take the cheques tomorrow
Don't forget the documents too
- The whole thing
- God bless you
Bye
Is your cheque money?
It's cash
It was meant to be
You couldn't have found a better
house than that. . .
And he wouldn't have found a buying
customer in this neighborhood anytime soon
I'll come to see you at the agency, thanks
- Bye
- Bye
It's nothing personal
I don't want your family to get tortured
- Says who?
- Your wife's heart isn't in this
And I don't want to have the curse
of your family on me all my life
And take this from me. . .
Don't treat your family like this
Don't break their hearts
This is more urgent than anythingelse
You'll excuse me, bye
- It's alright
- Bye
It's over
Thanks a lot
What are you doing?
Someone help me
Help me
Somayeh!
You're crazy
and have driven us crazy too
Two years
You want me to live in rented houses
with this handicaped girl?
How could you be so vengeful?
Don't I own a part of this house?
I won't sell
I would have done so years ago
to spend it on my daughter's treatment
You're not worried about your kid
You're only concerned with your share
I would not have married you. . .
If that was the case
Why are you embarrassed?
Just tell me you wanted a servant
and not a wife
I've worked so hard for you
Eversince the day I stepped in this house. . .
You've never treated me decently once
Have you ever touched me
except for beating me up?
I came into this house with my girl. . .
So you'd be a father to her
Didn't I do so much for your girl?
Why won't you let go?
Your wife died, and so did your girl
You won't bring them back to life
by killing yourself
Somayeh!
Let's go dear
Do you want me to take your hand?
Thanks
Her uncle's house is here
We'll manage from here
I'm not here to get your consent
I just want to say something and leave
I went to see Akbar today
I told him you won't change your mind
He doesn't have hope to get
your consent anymore
He knows he'll be executed in a little while
But he wanted me to tell you something
He said that he doesn't want the blood money
And so don't sell your house
to come up with it
He said he'd consent to be executed
without the blood money
Just make sure he's executed
as soon as possible
And he finally said. . .
To tell you. . .
To forgive him
Tell them to bring the blood money
I'll give my consent
God bless you Haji
You're the best
- What is it?
- He gave consent
He gave consent not to execute Akbar
- You're lying
- I swear to God
Akbar won't be executed
Are you serious?
I swear to God
Thank you God
He gave consent
He says Akbar won't be executed
He'll be free
He said it himself
Oh God, he gave consent
I ran all the way to here
We have to tell Akbar
Where are you going?
I came by to tell you this
A'la!
Why didn't you come today?
I didn't go to work
I thought you'd come for sure
I kept waiting by the window
I don't like it
- Me?
- No, myself
Why?
Akbar sent me here to get consent
Not to back stab him
What back stab?
You have a husband, it's not right
I'm not the type
Where do you sleep at night?
Anywhere possible
In the park or the terminal
Don't leave
Stay
Sleep in here
What if your husband comes?
I don't have a husband
Isn't he the father of your kid then?
That's all he is
I divorced him a year and half ago
But you are together
But everything between us is seperated
What is this on your finger then?
How do you think I've been living
in this neighborhood?
Just like this
A ring, and an addict
whom everyone thinks is my husband
Here if you don't have a man
You'll be faced with a hundred
men every night
Why did you divorce him?
I didn't want to have to sell myself. . .
Everytime he got hard up to make
money for his fix
Where is he now?
Don't worry, he won't be released
anytime sooner than a month
Sleep
I'm a lonely woman with a child
I get paid fifty grand a month
and I have to pay rent with that too
Even if I put everything I have together. . .
I may stretch it to be three hundred grand
Let's say I get a loan too
It'll be seven hundred grand
What will I tell Abolqasem
with seven hundred grand?
Ask him to forgive his girl's murderer
with that money?
I swear I wouldn't have hesitated
if I had the money
Why did you keep coming here then. . .
And forced me to work on the old
man to give consent?
Would you like me to talk to
the doctors at the hospital?
They might be less expensive
Not every doctor can do this operation
The expert doctors said she might
become paralyzed after the surgery
Let alone those fake doctors
You be in my shoe
what would you have me do?
What can I do?
Can't you let me know soon
so the old man makes his decision. . .
To have the boy executed?
He hasn't been sleeping nor eating
eversince he's decided to give consent
He's about to have a heart attack
Take your fuits with you as well
I'll come up with the money
- How?
- Never mind how
Don't even talk about it
So you want him get executed
for a couple of millions?
I keep telling you I hate men like that
So what?
Who are you anyway to be preaching me?
Don't I have the right to know?
- You don't know. . .
- I don't want you to go to prison
I swear to God I won't
I know my work
I've done this many times
Is that why you've spent seven
years of your life behind the bars?
I'll show you now
A'la!
Don't go for God's sake
Okay, stop
For me
Suppose I had the money to loan it to you. . .
It's just spending good money after bad
Remember how you sold your life
to have her operated on?
Did it make a difference though?
What if she becomes paralyzed after
the surgery?
What will you do then?
She'll be a piece of meat for
the rest of her life
That stupid Abolqasem doesn't
have a good head
You have to be wise
I've been wanting to tell you something
for a couple of days now
- But I'm embarrassed
- What is it?
There is a boy. . .
The one I told you who comes
and goes for the consent. . .
He's a simple kid
I thought now that they
don't have the money. . .
Is he a clean kid?
He's got guts, that's obvious
He went through hell and high water
Until he forced Abolqasem
to give consent
That's great
Your girl is handicaped
but not in the brain
Let him have her
What if it's imposing the boy?
What? You've been imposed
You have a stupid husband and
a handicaped girl
But if he doesn't want your girl
he can come up witht he blood money then
So the boy doesn't get executed
Ten
Why won't you tell him personally?
That's not right
I don't want him to claim that my
girl was given to him by force later on
You talk to him and send him over
In fact tell him in your own words
Tell him you've found a good girl for him
Make him like her slowly
You women know how to talk to each other
Hopefully when they're wedded. . .
We'll take Abolqasem to the court
To give consent so your brother is freed
What did they want here?
The same thing
Why did you cry then?
They want money
We already knew that
they didn't need to come here for that
They want the whole blood money
not just four million
Bullshit
that's what they said before
What's the difference?
I don't have the money. . .
Whether it's four or ten million
- Did you tell them you didn't have it?
- Yeah
It's useless though
They're looking for an excuse
to execute Akbar
They're going over their words
Take this
Thanks a lot
- Where are you going?
- They have to stand by their words
Don't go
I know how to convince them
- You go in
- Why are you scared of them?
A'la!
Is someone here?
A'la
Give it to me dear
Go and get freshened up a bit
Put on my colored scarf
Come in quickly
Hello
Why don't you eat something?
- Do you want me to cut them up for you?
- No I don't
I'll eat
- Did Firouzeh tell you to come here?
- Yeah
She's a nice girl
she wants the best for you
She's talked to me about
you a couple of times
I told her it's all up to fate
Eat something
Didn't you bring sugar cubes dear?
She panics everytime someone
comes to propose to her
I'll get them
Talk to the guest dear
Hello
- What?
- We got a guest
The boy who comes here for consent I
- What does he want here?
- It's a good thing
I'll tell you
Come here
- Hey mister!
- Firouzeh!
- Leave please
- I'm talking to you Firouzeh
Please leave
- Mister please
- Firouzeh!
Firouzeh!
Firouzeh!
Why are you running from me?
I'm late, what is it?
What should I do?
- What about?
- The condition they have
What can I say?
I can't tell you to marry her
to save my brother
I'm stupid, I'll do it if you want me to
What should I do Firouzeh?
She's a nice girl
- So are you
- Me?
I have a child
I'm older than you
I'm not good for you
But you were good for me
till just a few days ago
When did I ever tell you that?
You think I'm in love with you just
because I was good to you for a while?
I noticed you were busting your
bones for my brother Akbar. . .
So I was kind to you
You're lying
You want to force me to marry her
for your brother's sake
Don't then, if you don't want to
Why should you sacrifice yourself for Akbar?
I'm just telling you not to count on me
- Hold on
- I'm late
Shahr-e-Ziba
Shahr-e-Ziba
Shahr-e-Ziba
- Shahr-e-Ziba
- Which part?
- The rehab
- Where is that?
The Rehabilitation Center
Amininan
You have to make the decision
I can't
That's why I'm here
Does his sister love you?
A lot
Can you forget her?
- No
- Marry her then
What about Akbar then?
Do you know why Akbar killed that girl?
He loved her
How can you kill someone you love?
He didn't want for someone else to have her
What would you do
if you were in Akbar's shoe?
Would you have killed the girl as well?
I'd have forgotten her
So you can forget someone you love
Right?
You can forget Akbar's sister too
if that's possible
No, it's not
- Remember Shahin?
- Yeah
Remember why he had committed murder?
They didn't have the money
to pay for her mother's debts. . .
So they had to kill the guy
Yeah
Shahin didn't have a father
He loved his mother
He didn't want her mother to go to
prison for her heavy debt
He couldn't bear it
He killed the man
in order not to lose his mother
- Do you think he did the right thing?
- No
What would you do?
Would you have killed the guy
or have forgotten your mother?
I'd have forgotten my mother
So it is possible to forget someone you love
No it's not
I can't
It's easy to tell others to forget
The judges who gave death sentences
to Akbar and Shahin and others. . .
They too thought the same
What should I do Mr. Ghafouri?
I would have forgotten about
Akbar's sister if I were you
But I may fall in love some day
and won't be able to forget
Even if it's at the price of someone's death
Go and see the guys
Think it over, I'll be right here
If this boy marries your girl. . .
He'll destroy his and her life both
I know this boy
This condition is neither to yours
nor his advantage
It's been two years
Take off the black shirt
- Don't unwrap it
- Why not though?
I won't give consent
I won't step out of this house
unless I get your consent
Leave me alone for God's sake
Why do you keep torturing me?
Move away from the door
