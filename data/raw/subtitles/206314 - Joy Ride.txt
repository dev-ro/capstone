You made him cry?
I broke up with him.
Wouldn't you cry?
Listen, Venna,

I was kidding.
Well, I'm not
in the mood to go home.
Wish I had a car,

Decompress a little bit, you know?
Ifyou had a car, you could

Tellme.
Awesome!
I'd make you feel good.

You would?
If I were there and I asked you to,

That's my point.
Dude, I'm gonna gimp it.
I'm not just gonna run in there.
God! Just sit here.
I'll work us a deal, okay?
One more goddamn maid knocks

Sorry, Mr. Ellinghouse.

Sorry, my ass!
Where's your boss?

Can you understand that?
hi. Could I get a room for the night?
You can disturb me all you want.
I love towels.
Not done here, friend.
I know that, amigo. I'm just--
I haven't slept in two days.
You'd best not mess with me.
You just take care of your own shit.
Peace.

much-deserved revenge?
Are you crazy?
Come on! Do it!
Calm down.
This is amazing!
]

Rusty Nail. Hey, there.
Candy Cane.
I thought I'd lost ya.
Well, I guess fate
wouldn't allow that.
Glad to know you're
thinkin' about me.
Listen, I'm pullin'
over for the night.
You wouldn't be interested in
gettin' together later, would ya?
I thought you were
meeting with Black Sheep.
Well, that was the plan, but
how about I blow him off...
and take a chance with you?
-God.
I love you, man. This is so great!
Relax.
But I'm not sure that
I'd be what you'd expect.
Please.
Well, you are a man, aren't you,
with a soul and a heart?
That's all I'd expect.
Great.

Listen, I'll be
at the Lone Star Motel...
in Table Rock,
if you're interested.
Pink champagne.
Tell him that you like
pink champagne.

And if there's anyway you could
bring some pink champagne...
it's my favorite.
That was good.
What room?
Room 17. Midnight.
You got that, baby?
I got it.
I can't wait.
That was mean.
I know! I know! This is awesome!
That guy sucks, okay? he totally
body-checked me on the way out.
All you do is put
Do you miss home?
Yeah. I miss...
Mom's chocolate chip cookies.
Playin' football with Dad, Sundays.
Goin' to Oh, wait. That's
somebody else's childhood.
What I meant was,
''N-No-o.''
You should call sometimes.
You know, when
you don't need bail money.
Yeah, but how often is that?
I'm serious.
I call.
Yeah, I know exactly what he says
every time he hangs up the phone.
That I'm the world's biggest loser.
That's comin' from a plumber.
That's comin' from
a guy who wears...
a full-length lime green
jumpsuit to work every day.
They don't need me.
I don't need them.
It works like a charm
if you repeat it enough.
Listen.
hit the TV.
Oh.
It's Rusty Nail! It's him!
Shh.
Who the hell is it?
I brought the, uh, the drink.
This is amazing!
I brought the, uh,
pink champagne.
Is this a goddamn joke?
I swear to fucking God.
What are you--Are you Black Sheep?
Why don't you come overhere?
Are you fuckin' with me,
standing in the dark?
This prick is such an asshole!
Show me your face. What was that?
That was weird.
hey, you know what I think?
I think someone
might have gotten hurt.
No. No, we would
have heard that.
We did. That was a gasp.
Bet that Rusty Nail guygothurt.
No, it wasn't a gasp.
That was a laugh.
hey, where areyou going?
What, areyou calling Mom?
Front desk.
hi, we just, uh--
We just heard some disturbance from
the room next door, in, uh, Room 17.
Yeah, hi, this is the drama queen
from Room 18
That's hard to say.
It was like a like a thud.
What are you--
No, we think someone
might have been hurt.
And we thought you'd want
to check that out, maybe.
All right. Thankyou.
You know what's
gonna happen now, right?
Prick's gonna kill
the night manager.
hello?
Guy said everything's fine.
Allright. Thank you.
The guy said everything's fiine.
What'd I tell ya?
Goodmornin'.
how are you today?
Pretty good.
how are you?
Where are you boys from?
Originally, NewJersey.
Uh-huh. What are you doin' here?
We're drivin' cross-country.
My brother-Yeah, Lewis.
Your brother?
Where is he?
In the room. I don't know.
We had a little incident here
last night. Did you hear anything--
any sounds, or anything
out ofthe ordinary?
Yeah, actually, uh, uh, next door
I heard some sounds.
-Nextdoor?
Yeah.
-Could you describe those sounds?
Yeah, sure.
Theywere like, uh--
No, wait.
Like that.
What's goin' on?
All right, this is Lewis.
There was a ''sitchy-ashun''
last night. That's all I know.
So after you heard these sounds,
uh, did you look out your window?
Did you open your door?
No, sir.
What happened?
Afteryou closed your door,
around 10:15 P.M....
you didn't see anybody else until
I knocked on your door this morning?
That's right. Well, we did call
the night manager, because we were...
uh, concerned, right?
Right.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. he mentioned that.
And he also said that one ofyou
had an altercation with the victim.
Which ofyou was that?
Wait. The nightmanager said what?
Apparently one ofyou had words
with the victim, in the motel offiice...
when you were checkin' in?
No, no. We never met--
What?
Ellinghouse.
Ronald Ellinghouse.
he was staying in Room 1 7.
The huge guy?
Yeah, I met him.
-Buthe's-he'snot the one--
What happened to him?
It wasn't comely.
I'm sorry. I don't know
what that means.
he was found early this mornin'
lyin' face down...
on the highway median.
So, you're saying that the--
the huge guy is the victim.
You have no idea who might have visited
Mr. Ellinghouse's room last night?
No, sir.
I wish-I wish we could be
more helpful, but I--
Is he dead?
Coma.
You know what I'm thinkin'?
I'm thinkin' that a little look-see
might ''refreshify'' your memory.
Takin' a look-see at what?
Ripped hisjaw...
clean off.
That is the pain in my ass.
My own personal file of on going shit
that I got to deal with.
And now, guess what?
Now, I got me another one.
Mr. Ronald Ellinghouse...
layin' two inches from dead
in my jurisdiction.
Why? Because you sorry-asspunks
thought you'd have some fun.
Fuck!
I'd keep you retards in custody
if I thought it would help answer...
one of the hundreds
of new questions I got.
But, no. All you know
is his damn C.B. handle.
And maybe he drives a truck.
Doyou understand the kinds
of shit I got to grapple with now...
because ofwhat
you assholes did?
You! You got out ofjail when?
Yesterday?
I wantyou outta here.
This is like an old-fashioned western.
I want you out of Wyoming
before the sun goes down.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe you told them that...
we invited Rusty Nail back.
They could have
thrown me back injail.
A man is halfdead
because ofwhat we did.
Oh, bullshit.
Bullshit!
What,you order ten pizzas
for your neighbor...
a delivery guy gets there and
your neighbor opens up with an AK-47.
Is that your fault?
Yeah, maybe it is.
Fine.
Be the martyr all you want.
No, that's not what I'm doin'.
I'm trying to fiigure how I'm gonna
drive away afterwhat we've done.
Do what I do.
Just remind yourselfthat
in 1 00 years, you're gonna be dead.
It's the closest thing
I've got to a philosophy.
No, you know what? I'm taking you
to Denver, and that's it.
Great.
Eastbound, looking for a
westbound...

I think that you can

Tell him it was a joke.
-Uh, I talked to Candy Cane...
about last night.
And she said
that she's not interested.
No!
She's not interested in you--
Don't do this.
...or your pink champagne.
I need to find... Candy Cane.
You need to find...
a highly-qualified psychiatrist--
not a psychologist--
you're gonna need some drugs.
You're gonna have to fiind
a damn good lawyer...
because the cops
are all over your ass.
Goddamn!
Give it to me.
Hey, there,
Rusty Nail, you hear this?
That was me, all right? I'm a guy.
It was just a joke.

Apologize to him?
Yeah.
I-I'll do it.
No.
Listen, you sick fuck...

lonely walkie-talkie...
freak show motherfucker, you're
not getting anything from me.
Know why? I have something
more powerful than your psychosis.
It's called a volume knob.
And the only thing I need to make you
go away is to turn it counterclockwise.
Got that?
You copy that?
You know, Black Sheep,
you really ought to get that fiixed.
Get what fixed?
Your taillight.
-Do you see anything?
Yeah. Cars and trucks.

So.
I want to tell you how much
I appreciateyou doing this.
Picking me up.
It's pretty much the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.
This is the part
where you kiss the girl.
Well, historically.

hey, the room's this way.
Yeah, but the bar's this way.
here's to--
...Nebraska!
To states? All right.

Let's see what you're made of.
And... go.
Mm.

Yeah.
I'll be in my presidential suite.
Excellent.
We're gonna head to our--
our spinning hotel room.
Okay. See you later.
Good night.

This one.
hey! See, I told you
this was a good place.
Adult channels.
Good. hey, are you
in the mood for...
a story, or, like,
a collection of scenes?
She isn't a Navy SEAL.
God! Takes me right out.
hey, Venna's great, man.
She's got--
I mean, you guys--
You guys are just friends, right?
I mean,
that's what you said.
Right? You're just--
just hangin' out, and--
'Cause if you're anything
more than that...
you tell me right now,
and I'm gonna just-I'll--
...off.
You know?
Great.
Oh, we never got
those last drinks.
Yeah, um...
you know, ifwe're gonna
get an early start...
we should probably
just crash and go to bed.
Yeah. But, hey...
I'm a-I'm a licensed bartender.
Yeah, I'd show you my license,
but my hands are full, so--
Oh. Where's your better half?
he's busy. Snoring.
Well, you know, I really don't
think that I can drink anymore.
I disagree.
And I'm a professional.
Youknow what'samazing?
Nobodyknows
where weare rightnow.
Just kinda...
out there.
Floating.
If anybody wanted to find us
for some strange reason...
they couldn't.
What am I talking about?
I have no idea. here, try this.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Is Lewis okay?
he doesn't normally drink so much.
Yeah, he's totally fiine.
Fuller, get the phone.
hello.
Now I thought
you said there was no girl.
What?
You said there was no girl.
Fuller.
Listen, there--
There isn't any girl.
Then, what's she doing
in the other room with your brother?
he's out there!
he's watching us!
Rusty Nail?
he just called me.
Who's Rusty Nail?
he called you on the phone?
Yeah,just now. he knew you were
in here. he's watching us!
There's somebody watching us?
he just called.
What did he say?
he said, ''I thought there was no girl.''
And whatyou were doing...
in the room with her,
which is an excellent question.
We're gettin' out ofhere, so
put on your shoes.
I already paid for this room.
-Just do it!
how scared am I supposed to be?
Much more than usual.
Okay, there's nobody behind us.
Can somebody please talk to me?
he knows we're brothers.
how does that happen?
All right, we're goin' to the police,
we're gettin' offthe highway...
then we're goin' home!
Lewis, goddamn it!
Something weird happened to us
before we picked you up.
I didn't wanna tell you 'cause
I didn't wanna freak you out.
Tell me what?
You want the short version?
Talk tome.
There's this sick guy.
he put this guy in a coma.
Sick how?
This Rusty Nailguy
didsomething?
Because of something that we did.
What did you do?
hey, man, what the hell
are you doing?
he wants us
to look in the trunk.
There were signs
spray painted back there:
''Look in the trunk.''
Signs? What makes you think
they're for us?
Look.
What's going on here?
That's a pretty elaborate
thing to do, paint those signs.
No, no, no! No!
What? God!
Don't open it!
Why?
What ifthere's a head
or a body in there, man?
Oh, man, could be a bomb.
Think a bomb's a reason
not to open the trunk?
he's in the trunk!
I say we don't open the trunk!
I'm not getting back into the car
till I know what's in the trunk.
What areyou doing?
Oh, shit.
Okay, we plug it in,
and we don't talk on it.
We just listen.
And whatever he says, we just--
We just go straight to the police.
I'm not going to go anywhere...
until somebody tells me why
I should be afraid ofa radio.
Candy Cane, are you there?
Oh, that's right.
I don't mean my Candy Cane.
I mean yours.
Venna?
how does he know my name?
We're not getting into it
with this guy.
Let him talk all he wants.
Just tell me where we're going.
You know when a corpse
can't be identifiied?
No next of kin.
No one to claim the body.
What they do is,
they cut off all the fingers.
All ten of them.
And then they cut off the jaw.
They cut off
the person's jaw...
and they put it all in a jar.
They put it in a jar
with some number on it.
Oh, my God, that's Charlotte.
What?
That's Charlotte.
That girl? Your roommate?
Yeah, yeah.
hey, what the hell do you want?
I wantyou to go to the State Line
Truck Stop parking lot.
I'll fiindyou there.
Venna, please help me!
And if you go to the police...
I will take her apart
piece by piece.
Good morning.
hey, he's back.
We're here.
Okay, here's what I want.
Fuller, Lewis...
I want you two
to head inside.
Take a seat at the counter.
Order six cheeseburgers each.
What about Venna?
She stays put.
But you two are
going in... naked.
Naked?
If we go in there dicks hangin'...
they're just gonna call the police.
Aw, come on.
It's just for fun.
Bullshit,
I'm staying here.
Just stay up front.
I wantyou to keep the car running.
And if you see anything,
honk the horn and drive.
God, I can't fucking believe
we're doing this.
Billy, come on.
Get in the car.
Sissy.

Now they know what it feels like...
to be the brunt of the joke.
Your heart pounding.
Face burning hot.
Now they know what it feels like...
tobe the fuckingpunch line.
They told me what they did
toyou, and I'm very, very sorry.
Well, it's a little late
for that, isn't it?
I bet your friends
had a really good laugh...
seeing me standing there
in the rain, holding my bottle.
Well, that's a lesson your friends are
gonna have to learn the hard way.
You wanna see Charlotte alive again?
here's what you're gonna have to do.
Twelve cheeseburgers, please.
You want fries with that?
Is this a fraternity stunt?
Because if this wasn't
my restaurant--
A man's gonna kill our friend
if we don't come in here like this.
I'd say it was
a pretty good one.
We're not joking, man.
Oh, shit!
Man, we should be going to the cops.
We're not going anywhere
till we find out what he wants.
Right up here.
This is where we turn.
That's-That's what he said.
You out there?
We're here.
Something special's
waiting for you.
I'd say it's about
a hundred feet up the road.
So, get out of the car.
Wait. I'm not walkin'
one foot out of this--
We don't have a choice.
We're doing what he says.
What? he's-he's got Charlotte.
Get out ofthe car.
Wait!Goddamnit!
-Get out of the car!

It's just flooded, right?
You'll get it started.

-Just take it and turn it
all the way off, then on.
Right.
Want me to show you?
You gotta hesitate it for two seconds.
There it is.
All right, perfect.

Thanks a lot.
Where the hell you goin'?
That's my truck!
Everything's going to be all right.

You're gonna
