Put your cardigans back on!
It's freezing in here!
- You'll get sick! Put them on!
- We're thirsty.
- Louder. She can't hear.
- We're thirsty!
Wait 'til you've cooled down to drink.
That's what Thérèse says.
If you catch cold, your father
won't let you spend your holidays here.
- Shall I read to you?
- No, that's boring!
L'ESPÉRANCE
SUMMER 1922
Keep still. It's too hot.
- Will you come back tomorrow?
- Not every day. Then we'd get bored.
And my brother's coming
from Paris tomorrow.
- Thérèse! Dinner's ready!
- I'm saying goodbye to Anne.
You know what everyone says?
In a few years you'll marry my brother.
APRIL 1928
Careful, the ferns are very dry...
it hasn't rained for a long time.
- See the sheep-pen over there...
- La Bienvenue?
From la Bienvenue to I'Espérance
we have 2,000 hectares of pine forest.
My stepfather has 500
and my mother 1,500.
And between la Bienvenue and
Argelouse is mine, Larroques.
That's 4,500 hectares of pine forest when
we're married, Mrs Bernard Desqueyroux.
Yes. Soon.
Bernard, I'm also marrying
for the sake of the forest.
- Do you think that's wrong?
- Not at all.
Father says it's in my blood...
...but you're also in love with my forest.
There's nothing odd about it.
- Your beautiful head is full of ideas.
- Crazy ideas?
Some of them... like with all of us.
So you'll get rid of them
for me.
I feel I belong in your arms.
I long for you so much.
- One of the Azevedos.
- Lovely... he sings beautifully.
The son has TB for sure. His sister
died of it. Runs in the family.
- "Azevedo" is Portuguese, isn't it?
- Yes, maybe.
Whatever else... they're Jews...
You're not getting
too involved with Thérèse?
- Don't toy with her.
- I'm getting married to her!
- Can I have something to eat?
- At this hour?
Yes, I'm hungry. I'll get Balionte
to fix me an omelet. Balionte!
Balionte!
She's an upright, family-oriented girl,
but she thinks too much.
And she smokes like a chimney.
Her father is stubborn, like all radicals.
His thinking is all wrong!
Her mother was a believer,
but Thérèse was very young when she died.
- She's determined like her father.
- He's a man of influence.
He has a future in politics...
but remember... your future wife
is richer than us!
- Your husband spends too much.
- You'll ruin your appetite!
- Me? Never!
- Shall we go?
- See you at dinner?
- No, your husband teases me.
Nice outfit, Anne! - Hello, future
son-in-law... that sounds good!
- Same to you future father-in-law.
- Where are you going?
With guns and dogs...
where do you think?
Fetch it!
Drop it!
What a beauty!
Shall we give it to Thérèse?
- Do it.
- Don't you want to see your fiancée?
We see each other nearly every day. I'm
staying here. We'll get pigeons tomorrow.
- The first?
- Yeah.
- Is it satin?
- Silk satin.
- How elegant!
- Yes, but I doubt...
Weddings are all about tradition.
Muslin's quite enough. That's thunder!
You stay here.
End of discussion!
- What is it?
- Anne's staying the night.
Poor thing!
It's nothing. It's just thunder.
- Aren't you scared?
- What of?
In a month,
when you're married to Bernard...
- Of sleeping with your brother every night?
- Yes.
- Doesn't it scare you?
- No, I never think about it.
- You're lying!
- No, I swear... never!
- Some people like it, but others...
- Yes, we're all different.
- I don't think I'd like it.
- How would you know?
Have you tried?
Some girls in the convent school
do it to themselves, at night.
- That's a sin.
- A nice sin, perhaps.
- Didn't you ask them?
- No. Stop teasing me.
I think too much.
That's what scares me,
not sleeping with Bernard.
When I'm married,
it'll all fall into place.
I don't know how,
but it'll all fall into place.
The marriage will be my salvation,
Annette. Then I'll stop brooding.
I'll just have peace.
- I choose peace.
- Peace is completely uninteresting.
In novels, love isn't peace...
it's ecstasy!
Rapture... ecstasy.
You're my little sister.
My little girlfriend.
You said she was pretty.
Hi, Thérèse.
Bernard! Bernard!
HOTEL IN BADEN-BADEN
MAY 1928
"Dear Anne, we're staying at
the Black Forest's swankiest hotel"-
- "where your parents
had their honeymoon. "
"Maybe you were conceived there?"
"I'm called 'madame'.
They can't pronounce 'Desqueyroux'."
You should see it
when it's sunny.
"We lose money in the casino,
and eat cabbage and sausage"...
"and drink mineral water. "
Fetch!
Here boy! Here!
"I don't like writing. "
"But I promised,
so I make myself because I love you. "
"I miss you.
I've met a wonderful man!"
"If you knew how happy I am!"
"Do you remember the boat
Azevedo bought for his son?"
- Good morning!
- Good morning.
- I'm Jean Azevedo from Valméja.
- I know.
Give me a hand?
Thérèse!
Thérèse.
God almighty!
Can you feel how it's beating?
- Why... what happened?
- I don't know.
I became dizzy and felt faint.
Horrible!...
Maybe the food?
Are you still reading
that letter?
"Now I've experienced it, too. "
"I also have a man in my life. "
"Are you having the same good luck
with your husband?"
"Mr Desqueyroux. Personal. "
From your mother...
Does that piss you off?
No, this is more interesting...
three letters from your sister.
- The one who doesn't like writing.
- Here's your personal letter.
Anne admits she's in love with
the Azevedos boy who has TB!
It seems serious. She wants to get
married as soon as she comes of age.
Listen:
"Your sister has gone crazy.
What if Deguilhem finds out and backs out!"
Think about it... Open those letters...
Quick! Don't shilly-shally now, Thérèse!
- Open them now! What are you waiting for?
- For you to leave.
I'm counting on Thérèse. "
"She's the only one
who can straighten Anne out. "
You're our salvation, darling.
It's nothing to laugh at.
It's a disaster...
...if Anne doesn't marry Deguilhem.
Azevedo is richer.
They make Saint-Émilion wine, own land...
- They're Jews!
- An old Bordeaux family.
Yes, yes...
You're just trying to be difficult.
It's nothing. I'll have to get used to it.
Anne with an Azevedo... a TB-sick...
What'd your father and grandfather die of?
And mother? You think about that?
We get TB and syphilis, too.
Now you're going too far.
That's not even funny.
- Are you smoking again?
- We always sweep it all under the carpet.
- Luckily the servants keep us informed...
- I'm not listening.
I'll just wait 'til you're finished.
I know you think it's funny.
But I warn you, joking like that
does not go down well at home.
Thérèse, do you have anything against
going home earlier?
Any time you like, Bernard.
"My parents keep me locked up,
but I'm willing to wait. "
"Nothing will stop me
from seeing Jean. "
Mr Hermann, book 22nd class tickets
for Bordeaux in the morning.
"You showed me where. "
"It was you who chose where
I'd find happiness. "
"I don't get to see Jean.
I'm locked in. "
"They believe that you will
straighten me out. "
"I know you're on my side.
Hurry home so I can explain. "
"I'm happy and I'm suffering.
I gladly suffer for Jean's sake. "
"He writes that he's suffering too. Write
back... tell me what you think of Jean. "
"Do you agree he's the handsomest
in the world?"
I'm lucky to have a wife
like you.
What's happening with Anne is worrying,
but I'm also very proud.
My family depends on my wife
saving the situation.
We'll see...
They have Rhein wine. I've never tried it.
It's not cheap...
It's overrated.
Doesn't compare with Bordeaux.
"Not bad, but I prefer wine. "
- Anybody there?
- Yes, of course.
Doesn't seem so.
- What are you thinking about?
- I was thinking about...
...that I was also lucky
with my husband.
Yes, we make a good couple.
It'll be nice to get home again.
- Aren't you going to finish your dessert?
- No.
What's the matter, darling?
Is it the heat?
- Are you feeling sick? Already?
- No, I'm not expecting children, Bernard.
I was thinking of Anne's adventures...
and so I think about the family.
The family... most of all.
"I'd give up everything
for Jean Azevedo's sake. "
"We pulled back last time we cuddled,
because of him. "
"He says no. I want to go further. "
"He's proud he can withstand
temptation, where others give in. "
JULY 1928
No... no mail for you Miss Anne.
Thanks.
- Two letters from Mr Azevedo!
- Again already?!
The postman was happy
to give them to me.
- The postman can gossip.
- No, we know too much about him
- A little wine, mother?
- Thank you. - Serve Mr Larroque.
- Some soup, Mr Larroque?
- I never eat soup.
Some soup, Miss Anne?
- Excuse me.
- Tell me, dear friend...
Shall your miraculous Mr Briand
become a skilled leader some day?
Briand is for peace and reconciliation
with Germany.
Let's talk about something else. Parentis
forest, which we bought thanks to you.
Soon our family will own
a sixth of the county.
Bravo! We don't share opinions,
but our properties are made for each other.
Life's not worth living if you
don't own land. To democracy!
This is a family dinner, Dad.
I prefer when we're at loggerheads.
- No thanks.
- Make an effort, Anne.
Let's make an effort...
Where are you going?
- Where are you going?
- Let her be.
Go to Biarritz with your parents
so you can calm down.
While you're away I'll talk to Jean
and explain the situation.
That you're locked up and you love
him, but you both must be patient.
- I can't go away.
- You're not supposed to meet him!
No, but I know he's nearby.
You haven't had a letter.
Isn't it strange he doesn't write?
- Well, I don't understand...
- He's supposed to be going away, too.
In a month, to study in Paris.
What's so special about Jean Azevedo?
You wouldn't understand...
it's nothing I can explain.
Nothing would hinder me
if I really loved a man.
- Will you talk to Jean if I go?
- Yes, I told you so.
Give him my letters?
Write and tell me?
- Yes, I'll do that.
- Promise me?
At least YOU love me.
- Did I feel something in your stomach?
- Yes.
It's been moving
for a few days.
Thérèse will ask the boy to leave
Anne alone. We can rely on my wife.
See you, my lad!
Trust me, honey.
Everything will be okay.
Have a good trip!
You're doing the right thing.
Who are you talking to?
OCTOBER 1928
- Your feet go to sleep.
- Fourth month already...
Women suffer for men's sake.
You'll get tired and worn.
What would Miss Clara
know about it?
There it is!
I've been looking for it everywhere.
Pregnant women need to get up and walk.
Is she eating properly?
- Yes, she's eating.
- Put your slippers on.
- How do you feel darling?
- I feel fine.
Good. Would you like me
to stay with you for a while?
What's with you dogs?!
Quiet down!
- They're so restless! - You too...
go on! The pigeons won't wait!
Have you seen such beauties!
We netted them.
- Half a dozen... Fine and plump!
- Here.
- Thanks.
- Take them away!
You'll probably like their flavour.
"October 30, Saint Wilfrid. "
We're not German?!
It's October 30, Thérèse.
The month's end...
and mother waiting for news.
He's due to go to Paris.
You haven't spoken to him.
- "Him?" Jean Azevedo?
- Yes... him!
His name is Jean Azevedo.
Can you feel how it's beating?
Is that normal?
I don't know what you can feel,
Bernard.
Just because your father died
of angina...
Stop carrying on.
It's impossible at your age.
- Are you really afraid of dying?
- Yes, of course.
Really?
- Do you want some valerian?
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
Maybe you should go to Bordeaux
and see Berthier?
- Do you think it's serious?
- Go to Bordeaux.
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right... come in.
- Please sit down.
- Thanks, I'd rather stand.
- Jean Azevedo?
- Mrs Desqueyroux?
Thérèse, Anne's sister-in-law?
Pleased to meet you.
Anne's often spoken about you.
- Should I get married?
- Anne's crazy about you.
Anne's a lovely young girl, but it was
never definite regarding marriage.
- Is it forbidden to play for a bit?
- Anne is like my sister.
She wasn't playing.
It wasn't just a fling.
I know you won't be shocked...
- I know it's not... - You're not
like others in this neighbourhood.
She said that. She said one can talk
to you about meaningful things.
Anne certainly shared
her life's passions with me.
- What do you know about them?
- I know. You know as well.
You know what I'm talking about...
the life that awaits Anne.
The life that awaits all women
around here.
A bleak provincial life.
Proper, conventional and rigid.
- We're too young to be tied down.
- Hunters coming!
- They won't find us.
- Why not?
I have to get going.
Have you read "Fruits of the Earth"?
"Let every emotion be capable
of becoming an intoxication"
"Does what you eat affect you?
If not, you are not hungry. "
"A passionate existence is better
than peace and quiet. "
It's obvious you've read it.
Desire, pleasure...
Gide describes the good...
and seeks God.
- It's easy to believe.
- No, it's more complicated than that...
Purity is also beautiful.
I don't remember being clean.
At last you're shocked... admit it!
No... just surprised.
I'm not used to talking about feelings.
- What do you talk about at home?
- The weather, hunting, the latest gossip.
Or avoiding the subject.
That's what we're good at.
You put up with that?
A woman like you?
Well...
Goodbye then, Mrs Desqueyroux.
And Anne? We haven't talked about
what to do about Anne.
Why can't you write to her
and bring things to a close?
An affectionate letter
that also finishes things?
- There's nothing wrong with me!
- You're hurting me.
Sorry. According to Berthier, I'm a bit
anaemic. Anaemic! Can you imagine!
He wants to treat me with arsenic.
Balionte can go to the pharmacy.
- I have to get an appetite!
- I've spoken to Azevedo.
Good for you!
A letter will be perfect!
- Did he go along without any problems?
- Yes, he didn't really want to marry her.
Hullo there!
Did you believe that?
You really are naive, darling.
An Azevedo doesn't marry a La Trave!
It's simply not possible.
They're smart.
They don't risk losing anything.
- It's delicious soup!
- Nothing to shriek about!
Look at her and speak slowly.
Your soup's delicious.
I'll have to make it again.
- How is he otherwise?
- Who?
Jean Azevedo,
who wants to have my sister.
He's a young man.
- You're not eating. You have to
eat for two! - You manage that.
True.
I've got my appetite back.
As soon as I'd seen Berthier
I felt better. Unbelievable!
"My dearest Anne, soon I'll just be
a pleasant memory. "
"Now we must now ensure
we find our place in life. Regards... "
No, "regards" is a bit cold.
"Jean. " I'll end with just "Jean",
that'd be better.
I'll post it on the way home.
It'll be delivered in the morning.
What do you think?
I think...
...that it sounds horrible!
- If I were Anne...
- But you're not.
Anne's a simple little soul.
She'll soon get over it.
And she'll come to be happy about it,
I promise you.
One, two, three, four...
And one more... just to be sure.
it's good for you.
"I'm going to Paris tonight.
I'll miss our talks and walks. "
"See you in a year.
By then I'm sure you'll be free. "
"You were silent... properly so. "
"The silence of Argelouse
doesn't suit Parisians. "
"Without you,
I'm entering an endless tunnel. "
"A country
without roads or paths. "
"You didn't answer my last letter.
Aren't countrywomen worth it?"
"A pregnant woman
is not a pretty memory... "
What are you doing?
- Are you writing?
- I'm coming.
- You're going to bed too late.
- I still can't sleep.
- Is it because of the baby?
- Probably.
- See you soon.
- Good night, Bernard.
"You must have thought me boring.
A fool... "
- "but not because of wrong circumstances
and attitudes. "
"I ordered the books you liked.
I understood nothing. You see, a fool. "
- Where's Jean?
- Did you get here from Saint-Clair?!
Where is he?
- He's left.
- I don't believe you.
They were not his words in the letter.
I know him!
You dictated them!
You betrayed me to save me!
You soon became one of the family!
You're worse than my mother!
At least she doesn't pretend to
be emancipated! You disgust me!
- Where are you going?
- To Valméja.
- I'll wait for him.
- He's in Paris!
- You're lying!
- Wait, Anne!
Stop!
Leave me alone!
Don't touch me!
I'll go to Paris.
I'll find him.
What are you doing here?! That's enough!
- Let her go!
- Careful! She's hurt!
- You get to bed!
You know what we do with bitches
that run off... we lock them up!
- I'm not scared of you!
- Shut up!
- See what your husband's like!
- Quiet! Get upstairs! Upstairs, I said!
- Are you taking your walk?
- Yep.
It's good for the baby.
I'm walking, not the baby.
- Shall I come?
- Not necessary thanks.
"My husband treats me
like a fragile vase. "
"What's in my womb
is all that matters to him. "
"It feels like I no longer exist. "
On, two. three, four...
DECEMBER 1928
"For my sake
and for the sake of the child... "
- "I'll give birth at my in-laws
amidst that Holy Family. "
She's got Bernard's wind.
He screamed like that as a baby.
This morning she didn't want to breastfeed.
Not last night either. She'll need a bottle.
Play now, Anne!
You are so sluggish, my girl!
She needs a nappy change.
Balionte! Balionte!
- You want me to take her?
- Yes, if you want.
Balionte!
- Balionte!
- She likes it with you.
- She prefers me.
- Yes. Annoying...
- She's so sweet...
- Balionte!
AUGUST 1929
500 hectares yesterday! 500!
Can you believe it?!
If the wind had changed
the Balisac forest would have burned.
- One two, three, four.
- Stop counting your drops!
Lucky that wasn't a north wind!
Villages never burn.
It's weird.
Fires prefer trees to people.
- How is it?
- Beating hard.
The fire's making you nervous.
Shut the window! The smell is unbearable!
We'll suffocate.
- If only it would rain.
- It'll never rain again.
Why do you say that? Stop kidding.
Fires are nothing to joke about.
I know that, Bernard.
- The fire's far away.
- No, it's coming this way!
It's in the Hosten's.
It's coming full speed!
It's burning in the south, non-stop!
We must sound the alarm.
No, people will only panic.
This is worse than the summer of '21...
from Saint-Flovier to Bienvenue!
- I'll get her.
- A third of Deguilhem's forest!
Mrs Deguilhem hasn't recovered yet.
- Do you mind if I change her?
- Not at all.
I forgot to take my drops!
One, two, three, four.
- Bernard, the mayor is here.
- Yes.
- The fire is close. We must
sound the alarm. - How close?!
- Close, Bernard! Nobody listens to me.
- In the Hosten's or Mano.
- What a stink!
- Can't we close the windows?
Even if we close the windows
it'll smell of burnt resin in the house.
Oh my God! I thought
I'd die of heat stroke!
You did the right thing taking it easy.
It's burning in Mano. It won't come here.
I'm dying of thirst!
Did I take my drops?
One, two, three, four.
You've taken it all calmly.
It hurts.
- Has he eaten anything special?
- Just fresh almonds.
- That may be it.
- No, it's because of the fire.
We were so worried.
And this terrible smell makes him sick.
Thérèse... Thérèse!
I have to throw up!
Six, seven, eight, nine.
- Where are you off to?
- I want an omelette.
- Eggs, after two days in bed?!
- I need to recuperate.
Mother was right.
It was the fire's fault.
- Here!
- I almost forgot the drops!
I should give them to you.
One, two, three, four.
yes, I always count my drops.
- I'll get Balionte to make an omelet.
- Thanks darling.
Mr Desqueyroux
isn't feeling better I see.
- And how's little Marie?
- Excellent. She has an iron constitution.
That's good.
Regards to your husband.
Hope he gets better.
Thanks Mr Darquey. 'Bye.
It's not paratyphoid.
He has a high pulse rate and low fever.
A bad case of 'flu... i don't know
what else it could be...
He's not getting better.
We need a specialist.
- Pédemay's a good friend, though he gets
mad. - Bernard would only get worried.
- She's right... that would be worse.
- Thérèse!
Dear God...
Mrs Desqueyroux? Madam!
- Madam, can you hear me?
- She's awake.
- You gave us a fright!
- She's here day and night.
- She doesn't eat or sleep.
- It's orange wine from last year.
- It does the trick.
- Give me some. I need to calm down
- Now I feel better. - You are
totally exhausted. You need to rest.
I hope it's not the 'flu.
Maybe I should consult
a colleague.
"We returned to Argelouse.
The air is better and hospitals closer. "
My handwriting's been falsified.
I never prescribed that amount!
There?
- And there?
- Poor thing seems to have lost feeling.
There?
- Since when couldn't he move his legs?
- Late this morning, doctor.
Can I talk to you?
Counterfeit prescription and paralysis...
Don't leave him alone with his wife.
- I understand. - Did you hear?
- Can I drive you?
I'll do it. Stay here.
Keep his wife away
'til we get help.
What will happen?
Easy for you to say things, but...
It's best that you
leave here.
Best you go.
Wait!
She can't sleep
without this.
A hospital in Bordeaux?
Why not in Paris while they're at it?
What could they find?
What's wrong with our doctors?
Are you hungry, honey?
Pédemay is going to charge you
with falsifying prescriptions.
How could you?
How could you do that?!
- Good day, Balionte.
- Good day.
Thanks.
- Good day, Balion.
- Mrs Thérèse...
- My husband is waiting for me.
- Who is it?
It's Marie...
You can let me in.
I promise nothing will happen.
- Hullo.
- You can go, Balion.
Sit down.
It's not fitting that we
'thou' each other anymore.
- You think that's funny?
- No, Bernard.
You're probably right.
Have you prepared
your defense?
- No.
- Of course not...
We do it together,
but then you must tell me everything.
- All the judge and your lawyer says.
- My lawyer?
Yes, attorney Duros...
a family friend who we trust.
- "We?"
- Family, me, your father...
You may move there some day.
Well, you can't be happy staying here!
- I can live with Aunt Clara.
- Yes, it's closer to the court.
Was that all?
- Can I hug Marie?
- No, better she doesn't see you.
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.
Good evening, Anne.
Thanks, Balionte.
- She's gone now.
- My son is a saint.
He protects the family
at any cost!
"On the road I met a stranger. "
"He asked me to pick up his prescription
at the pharmacy. "
"I did not know it was false
and that he was owed money. "
"I did not know him.
He was simply dressed "...
Oh my God, Thérèse! Come up with
something else, for the sake of the family!
What a cock-and-bull story!
Dr Pédemay has charged you with forgery!
He's covering himself!
If he doesn't retract, we're done for!
It was too dark.
I didn't see his face.
- He didn't say where he lived.
- Why did you take it for him?
- You knew nothing about him.
- I felt sorry for him.
I did it out of Christian charity.
- Next day he brought medicine to the house.
- And no one else but you saw him?
No, Your Honour, no one else.
I'm sorry.
Right. Mr Desqueyroux will testify tomorrow,
did you hear that?
My regards to your husband...
He must confirm that you mentioned
the stranger's prescription.
- Mrs Desqueyroux, are you listening?
- Of course... I heard you.
Say that I mentioned the man's prescription
and that he brought the medicine.
But don't say I was careless.
Yes, we mustn't exaggerate.
It must be watertight, simple, believable...
...trite and commonplace.
We need to play it all down.
- How's the judge?
- Logical, methodical, analysing...
- He likes simplicity.
- Yes, watertight, simple, believable.
- They get a good, unembellished story.
- Simple, not serious.
- He is intelligent, cultured.
- Sure. - Come on in!
Good evening, sir.
It's time for the little one's bath.
- Marie, come on now.
- No.
- Well, come on.
- What fine, rosy cheeks!
Although it's been raining for days!
Do you want to go out
and play with the dogs?
You're tired.
I should go. See you tomorrow.
- Thérèse?
- Yes?
Duros hasn't sent his bill.
I want to pay for each session,
not a lump sum.
He's not cheap... Ask him to send
his bill immediately. Don't forget.
No, I won't forget.
- What's he intend saying?
- I'm tired.
What will Bernard say? You're not fighting?
This is no time for that.
- My wife mentioned the prescription that
evening. - Did you say something?...
- About receiving prescriptions from
strangers! - Yes, that she's too timid.
She really thought
he was desperate.
She should have been wary
and been careful, but...
- Have some water, Mr Desqueyroux.
- Excuse me.
I never counted the drops.
I took a wrong dose.
Seemed to go well,
but you never know...
- Ask Balionte to get me something to eat.
- Are you thirsty?
- I'll tell Balionte. 'Bye then.
- 'Bye, Thérèse.
December 7, 1929
LAST DAY OF THE HEARING
- Goodbye, madam.
- Goodbye, Your Honour.
- Counsel.
- Your Honour...
Case dismissed!
- No unpleasant surprises?
- Not at all.
- Thanks to my son-in-law's testimony?
- Pédemay withdrew his lawsuit.
- A victim's testimony...
- No one has died!
Yes, my son-in-law is alive.
- "Victim of abuse. "
- Is the car far away?
Balion's parked on Place des Gemmeurs.
We couldn't very well pick you up here!
Soon, it'll all be forgotten,
but now we have to fix this mess.
This is the last time
you'll have to drive me.
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.
Goodbye, madam.
Are you going home this evening?
Yes, my husband's waiting for me
at Argelouse.
He's feeling better now that
the hunting season's approaching.
I thought I'd stay a few days...
No! Are you crazy?
You can't leave your husband now!
You must be inseparable!
Do you follow me?
Don't you understand that?
And you must obey your husband!
- Get in now!
- Goodbye. All's well that ends well.
Bernard.
Bernard, listen to me
without interrupting me.
The way I see it...
...from my point of view.
You'll understand.
I didn't want to do anything criminal.
I don't know what I really wanted.
Do you understand?
- Do you believe me?
- I understand you, Thérèse.
I believe you.
I forgive you.
You forgive me? Is that true?
I'm thirsty.
Would you go down to the kitchen
and fetch something to drink?
How dare you smile!
"No one can help me. "
- Good evening, Balionte. What are
youdoing here? - Good evening.
They'll stay here with us now.
There's chicken broth and wine in your room.
You must be famished!
Why don't you go to bed?
It's late!
- The case was dismissed.
- The decision was definite.
Let me disappear.
- That's all I ask of you.
- Quiet. How dare you demand anything!
From now on, you listen to me
and obey my orders.
- I decide everything and you obey.
- Or what?
You testified in my favour.
You could be accused of perjury.
I did it for the sake of the family.
I lied for the good of the family.
I don't count.
People must believe we're a couple.
I'm staying here.
But we don't share rooms.
You can eat in your room.
- And Aunt Clara?
- Don't interrupt me.
That's the way it'll be.
You are not allowed
in any other rooms in the house.
I'll see you on Sundays at Mass
and Thursdays in the square.
Marie stays with mother
who'll travel to Biarritz with Anne.
We'll blame your health.
Did you think you'd get to keep the
little one? She'll inherit the forest.
- Do you think that was the reason?
- What else?
It doesn't matter.
I don't care.
You mean nothing to me anymore...
but you still bear my name.
I'm going to bed.
Balionte's prepared the west room.
It's got everything you need.
I'm afraid.
It's your aunt, ma'am.
OCTOBER 1930
- Did I scare you?
- You're not allowed in the kitchen.
I'm just getting tea.
Since you're here...
Can we be alone?
Certainly sir. Come on.
Everyone seems to believe
we get along well.
They think you're sick, depressed.
Some people even feel sorry for you.
You think you want to stay here and that
I visit sometimes, which is good.
I leave tomorrow. You won't go to Mass.
You're still not a believer.
- And Marie?
- The girl's doing well, thanks.
Ask Balion to come back
when you go out.
"Dearest Anne, you'll never read this.
I'll burn it. "
"So I still wrote it? Even if you read it
you wouldn't understand anything. "
"You don't understand
what I've done "...
..."or what's happened to me. "
"Or how the poison germinated under our
feet in that summer in Argelouse. "
What a pigsty!
It stinks! What's the point of carrying
water up here? You don't touch it.
It's your fault!
"You can't understand
how I've suffered. "
"This country without roads
where I've been a prisoner... "
Sooner or later
you'll set the house on fire!
You won't burn holes
in these sheets!
"Just like your brother, you're
a hopelessly uncomplicated individual. "
"I saw you love...
and I hated you for it. "
"I saw you suffer, but even your suffering
was clear and understandable. "
"Now I'm trying
find myself again. "
"You'll take your place without knowing
what role you played... "
..."in our story... in my crime. "
"You Marry Deguilhem
and forget Jean Azevedo and me. "
"I'll vanish as a relative
you are ashamed of in the photo album. "
"Marie will forget my name. "
"I will no longer exist
for you, my daughter or my family. "
You have a letter from Mr Bernard.
Can't you read it? If he's coming
I must have time to prepare everything.
"Balion has told me
you are well. "
"I'll be there on the 20th
with Anne and François Deguilhem. "
"The Deguilhems wants their son
to meet you before they post the banns. "
Pull yourself together, ma'am.
The master and the betrothed will
be here in ten days.
The betrothed?
With ten days, we've time
to get you on your feet again.
I've cooked chicken. You may eat
in the kitchen with us, by the fire.
And I bought red wine
and cigarettes.
- Pull yourself together now!
- I'm tired.
She's doing the best she can.
We can't force-feed her.
Mr. Bernard can train dogs.
He puts a choke-leash on them.
That'd get her to obey quick-smart.
She scares me.
Maybe I should wash her hair...
- You aren't too cold, darling?
- I am a little.
Old houses like this
are impossible to warm up.
- Do you have a cellar?
- No.
The floor will start to rot, for sure.
Though you could always put down
a layer of cement.
That's quite possible!
- See what she's doing. Maybe she's sick.
- She won't come down.
- She'll surely find an excuse.
- And no kisses on the cheek, thank you!
- To take her hand is bad enough.
- Stop it!
The worst part is her hypocrisy!
Being a murderer's one thing,
but this hypocrisy is horrible!
- Yes, but think of the family.
- That's just what I'm doing!
Otherwise I wouldn't be here!
- She's coming!
- I didn't hear anything.
What is it? Don't look at me like that.
I'm alright.
I've not been able to go out
and have lost my appetite.
Better that than getting fat...
Good day Bernard...
Good day... in-laws!
Good day, Thérèse.
Anne... Anne...
My darling... I'm so happy!
I'm so happy for you!
You are really lucky, sir.
I know that, madam.
Well, tell me about the wedding
and your wedding dress.
You don't have long winters here,
do you?
But there's always something
for a housewife to do...
How many loads of resin
do you get from Balisac?
- No more than four.
- Four? Tell me more.
- Don't you want to hear how Marie's going?
- Yes... for sure... really!
- Tell me about Marie.
- She's adorable!
- She's talking well now?
- She repeats everything you say.
In her way... she's funny.
If she hears a rooster or a toot
she points like this and says:
"Did you hear the music, Nanou?"
She calls me Nanou.
She is just wonderful...
Has she really fainted?
The Balion pair have some
questions to answer!
Careful... they know too much!
And Balion is the only one who knows
where the property boundaries are.
Drink this. It'll cheer you up.
Everyone has left.
You're scared, Bernard.
You're afraid I'll die.
Nonsense!
You're not going to die.
Right! What would people say then?
No, Thérèse.
We said two after each meal.
Yes, you are right.
- Weigh yourself this morning?
- Yes, I've put on two kilos.
Great!
A little more. Walking's the best exercise.
Then, in the evening you'll eat well!
Shall we go to I'Espérance?
It takes a bit long. Another time.
I'd rather go home.
As you wish.
Thérèse,
wait until Anne's wedding is over.
Everyone needs to see us together
for a while longer.
- Then you can leave.
- I can leave?
That's what I said.
Then I'll go to Paris and stay in a hotel
or apartment.
No, at a hotel.
At least to begin with.
As you wish.
Are you afraid the footpath
will catch fire?
In Paris there's something
called ashtrays...
Thérèse, I'd like to ask one thing.
I want to know...
Was it because you hated me?
Did you think I was horrible?
It was to keep all the pines
for myself, Bernard!
I don't believe that anymore.
Why did you do it?
Maybe to see you worried.
Confused.
Curious.
Everything I'm finally seeing now.
Seriously... Why?
Do you always know
why you do what you do?
I'm not trying to hide anything
from you.
But I can't give you any good explanation,
just lies.
- You must have decided on a particular day?
- On the day when it burned in Mano.
That day it was as if
it was my duty.
Yes, a horrible duty.
- Just say what you wanted.
- I know what I didn't want.
I didn't want to pretend to be
someone else... and play a role.
But the Thérèse who was proud to get married
was also me.
- Are you leaving?
- I don't want to miss the train.
I understand. Bernard?
- Yes?
- I would like to apologize.
I'll get my things
and say hullo to Marie.
No, that's not necessary.
I promise to take care of everything.
You can come to weddings and
funerals. They're plentiful.
Well...
- Aren't you hot?
- It gets cold in the car in the evening.
- You'll feel lonely.
- Don't worry about me.
Every generation's had its bachelor.
Too bad we didn't have a son
who can carry the name on.
No... stay there.
- Goodbye, Thérèse.
- Goodbye, Bernard.
Everything is already paid.
The bill, I mean...
