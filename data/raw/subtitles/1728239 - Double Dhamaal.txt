BIoody basket.
When wiII our dreams come true?
For two years.. for
the past two years..
..we have been
standing near this board.
But there is no trace
of a singIe accident
Boman.
- Yes.
Name is there but there's no trace.
Excuse me, Adi.
How wiII we benefit
from a car accident?
You are asking after two years.
This is the road where
that baId miIIionaire..
..toId us the secret of miIIions.
Oh no!
'In St. Sebastian garden, Goa.. '
'.. under a big W.. a big W
there are 100 miIIion hidden.'
'100 miIIion.'
Mama wiII be proud of us.
You made me donate aII the money.
'Come on, Adi, give the money.'
'Why shouId I give the money?
Am I crazy? '
'Give it, Adi, for mama's sake.'
Since then.. day and night
we have been keeping an eye..
..on cars passing-by.
Thinking now there
wiII be an accident.
Now there wiII be an accident.
Not even a singIe car.
DisgracefuI.
Hey, brother.
Hey, brother. Bang
your car. Bang your car.
Hey, brother, at
Ieast you bang your car.
Look, I am pIeading to you.
At Ieast Iisten to me.
Hey, brother..
If you act so badIy peopIe

Yes, no car wiII meet
with an accident here..
..because we are.. very unfortunate.
Now, there's just one way Ieft.
- What way?
The devious way.
Adi, what are we doing at this bar?
Oh, we are going to
cook omeIet and seII them.
No omeIet, we are going

Of course!

Can I sit?
What are you going

Mister, if you can keep
this egg in your mouth..

Tony, can keep an entire
chicken inside his mouth..
..for 5000 so what's an egg.
Then.. keep this in your mouth.
Then give me the egg.
He has done an amazing thing.
Forget about the egg and

Fine, first you do it.
Then I wiII do it.

SwaIIow the egg. SwaIIow the egg.
Break the egg.
Break the egg.
Break the egg.
Break the egg.
Break the egg. - Great.
Save me.
Adi. Okay.
Adi.
Hit him, hit him, oh shit!
You can't hit me.
Oh no.
There they are. Beat them.
Enough. Enough.
No one ever beat us up so badIy.
Adi, be thankfuI that at
Ieast they didn't rape us.
Our fate has raped us.
If we had money..
..then we wouId've
had so many things.
Yes, car, bungaIow,
bank baIance and ma..
Mother.
- Quiet.
Mercedes Benz.
Yes, Mercedes.
Like the one Kabir's sitting in.
Kabir.

Where did that miserabIe
guy get so much money from?
Even he donated his money.
Run. Run, run, foIIow him!
Such a big car.
Such a big office.
How did Kabir become so rich?
LoyaIty, honesty,
dedication and responsibiIity.
Today Kabir Naik is rich
because of these four quaIities.
And I have seen these four
quaIities in the four of you.
Thank you.
And that is why the
four of you are here.
Sir has appointed you
the chief executive..
..of our next muIti-miIIion venture.
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
That's nothing.
Sir is giving you furnished
apartments aIong with fixed saIaries.
And yes, everyone wiII
have a personaI car as weII.
CongratuIations.
Thank you.
Sir, how do we thank you?
- Just Iike you do.
Look, if the four of
you keep working hard..
..then one day I wiII make
you partners in this company.
Partners.
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
It's okay.
- Thank you.
Okay. Okay. Come on.
It's okay.
Instead of us four taIented peopIe..
..he's making these
four fooIs his partner.
It shouId have been
us in their pIace.
If we become the partners..
..then we wiII have car, bungaIow,
bank baIance.
But how wiII we become partners?
EmotionaI..
- Torture.
Yes, Iet's go.
Adi.
Adi, no. Adi, no. Not this way, Adi.
Not this way.
Napkin, sir. Napkin.

Tandav.

Yes, yes.
How are aII of you?
What are you doing here?
- CIeaning the toiIets.
What?
- Shocked, aren't you?
That why
inteIIigent peopIe Iike us..
..are doing such a backward job.
Have courage, Roy, have courage.
We wiII be successfuI.
There's hope in our hearts.
No matter how much it stinks.
Cotton.. just Iike there's
cotton stashed in the piIIow..
..there are four things
stashed in us as weII.
No, no, no, we are born with it.
Like.. IoyaIty.
- Honesty.
Dedication.
- Deceit.
No, no, not deceit. ResponsibiIity.
Just a minute.
That's what I said.
- And we heard it.
Outside the window, covertIy.
- QuietIy.
You eavesdropped
on my conversation..
..and now are
putting up a charade here.
It's not a drama but
emotionaI torture.
So that you can forget
about those four fooIs..
..and make us your partners.
Make your four partners.
- Yes.
Good idea. - Thank you.
If I even appoint
you watchmen here..
..it wiII be insuIting to them.
FooIs.
He humiIiated us so badIy.
Now no matter what happens..
..but we wiII be your partners,
Kabir. - Yes.
Otherwise I am the
son of two fathers.
And I am the son of three father
I am the son of four fathers.
I am the son of the entire India.
There's no one in the office.
Seems Iike Kabir caIIed us first.
He ought to, after aII we are VIP's.
Very important person.
Now we'II have money,
position, power.
Now everyone wiII saIute
us and say.. - ScoundreIs!
RascaIs.
You wiII be punished.
EquaIIy.
- Much more than that.
No.
You rascaIs, scoundreIs, fooI,
stupid, morons..
I hadn't sIapped you.
You gave a 100 crores
estimate to Kabir sir on month end.
Yes. - But the profit
was just 99,99,99,000.
That means there was a
Ioss of 1000 rupees.
You.. you deserve one more sIap.
SIap.
- SIap.
Take them away.
- Okay, boss.
Come on.
- Okay, okay.
No, no, no.
Such severe torture
for just 1000 rupees.
Kabir sir has appointed
four new peopIe in your pIace.
That means us.
- That's why you are fired.
Fired!
And Kabir sir doesn't just say fire.
Then?
- He fires with his gun.
Give me the gun.
You are dirty.
Give me the gun! Gun!
Okay, boss.
Where is he taking it out from?
Gun.
JaIIad.
- Yes, boss.
CIose the door.
- Okay, boss.
Don't kiII us.
- No.
Don't shoot us.
Murder. Murder.
Run away.
You won't get anything
here except for death.
Run, Arjun, run!
Run!
Just a minute.
Kabir sir.
Look, he is here to kiII us.
Let us go, pIease.
I won't Iet you go Iike this.
See, he wiII kiII us.
I wiII kiII you?
- See, he is teIIing us.
''I wiII kiII you.''
- Shut up, you idiots.
Otherwise I wiII fire you guys.
See he wiII fire at us.
So this is your doing.
Yes.
- ObviousIy.
And untiI you keep
caIIing such idiots..
..we wiII keep driving them away.
UntiI you don't
make us your partners.
Understand.
- Partners.
No.
- No. No vioIence.
Kabir. - PIease.
Nice.
DarIing, what's going on?
Is everything aIright?
Who is she?
She is our madam. Kabir sir's wife.
Wife?
- Yes.
She's his wife.
Sister-in-Iaw!
- Sister-in-Iaw!
Who.. who are they, Kabir?
- Kabir?
Not, Kabir. Ram, and you are Sita.
And we are Ram's younger brothers.
So sweet.
- Thank you.
Just a minute. Ram onIy
had three younger brothers.
ReaIIy?
That's okay.
Consider yourseIf Draupadi..
..and us, four pIus one,
five Pandavas.
DarIing, you go on, I wiII join you.
Okay, darIing, bye.
Bye.
- Bye.
The four of you managed
to barge inside my office.
But if you try to
barge in my bungaIow..
..then I wiII punch your face in.
He's very short-tempered.
Kabir, not just your bungaIow but
we wiII foIIow you even to heII.
Come on, foIIow him.
Enough is enough, Kabir.
There's a Iimit to everything.
I don't want to
discuss this any more.
You understand.
Did you understand anything?
- No. I mean yes.
But, I need some money..
- I said no means no, Kabir.
I give you money every month for
the monthIy expenses, isn't it?
Not a singIe penny more.
If I couId get 500,000..
- You won't get five rupees.
DarIing, juice.
He turned out to be a
poor beggar just Iike us.
Bye. Bye. - Bye.
He's a beggar and she's poor.
He is Iiving off his wife.
36.
- 24. - 36.
Seven.
Shoe size. Shoe size.
You are Iooking at her
shoe size, aren't you ashamed?
She is Iike our sister-in-Iaw.
What a sister-in-Iaw.
Honey, Iisten to me.
Kabir, why don't you understand?
I don't want to have
this discussion any more.
The discussion is over.
I am going for a shower.
HeIIo, GuIabo.
- GuIabo.
My, sugar honey, sugar pie,
sugar doII, sugar bag.
That scoundreI is having an affair.
That too so sweet.
He wiII die of diabetes.
Idea. Listen.
My wife must have been
born after 1000 foxes died.
I am toIerating my wife for money.
Otherwise I wouId
have Ieft her Iong back.
I wiII adjust it in the accounts..
..and get your set by tomorrow.
And after that
Iights off, Jacuzzi on.
And have some fun in the Jacuzzi.
Kabir and guIabo wiII be together.
Where is my other phone?
Kabir.
Your mobiIe is right here.
You here.
How did aII of you come here?
And my mobiIe.
- And this mobiIe has an MMS cIip..
..which has Kabir and
GuIabo's conversation.
Yes.
'My wife must have been
born after 1000 foxes died.'
'I am toIerating my wife for money.'
'Kabir and guIabo
wiII be together '.
Adi, what if
sister-in-Iaw sees this cIip?
He wiII be in troubIe.
- Shut up.
You are trying to bIackmaiI me.
- No.
We aren't trying we are doing it.
Quiet!
You think I wiII be scared of you.
- No.
We are sure you wiII be scared.
If you don't make us your partner..
..then we wiII send this MMS
cIip on sister-in-Iaw's mobiIe.
Kabir.
The button wiII get pressed.
The button wiII get pressed.
Kabir.
Why am I hiding? You hide.
Kabir, what have you sent?
What a superb joke you
have messaged me? - Joke?
Yes. Husbands and the
sun are so unfaithfuI.
They come with
'Kiran' (Ray of Iight).
Stay with 'Roshini' (Iight).
And Ieave with 'Sandhya' (evening).
This better be a joke, Kabir.
- Of course, darIing.
If you don't make us your partner..
..then we wiII make a joke out
of you in front of your wife.
Yes. - This isn't how
one becomes partners.
One has to come to the office
and work to become partners.
We wiII sureIy come to the
office but you wiII do the work.
And these goggIes are reaIIy
nice to watch you do the work.
Can I pIease have it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you. That Iooks cooI.
And to come to the office,
we need a car.
The car keys. Because it
won't Iook nice if we waIk.
Yes, this is damn cooI.
Get Iost. - Auntie.
This isn't what I thought of you.
Ma'am, I aIways doubted sir.
What did I ever ask for?
That there shouIdn't be
any dearth in my Iove.
Instead I got a rascaI.
But I Iove this rascaI, darIing.
I Iove you so much.
My dear sister, do you
know who's responsibIe..
..in making me a con.
- Who, brother.
Bachchan sir.
- You mean, Big B.
Yeah!
When the poIice
department stopped my promotion..
..and transferred me to YavatmaI.
I had nothing to do there
except for watching teIevision.
And everyday at 9
o'cIock Bachchan sir..
..wouId come on teIevision and say..
..''Kaun Banega Crorepati,
Kaun Banega Crorepati.''
That's when I reaIized..
..that its important to be a
con first to be a miIIionaire.
And now with the two
of you supporting me..
..we three cons wiII
make their pIight bad.
But, brother, the other four were
reaIIy perfect for our pIan as weII.
We managed to trap
them with difficuIty.
They ran away because of these four.
And then they came to me and said..
..pick us, pick us.
So what couId I do?
Last time I was going
to have a great time..
..with a huge amount of money.
But my pIan was foiIed
because of these four fooIs.
But now.. no goof ups.
My dear sister, you keep
pIaying the roIe of my secretary.
And Kamini, you as my strict wife.
What is this nonsense, Kabir?
These four aren't even quaIified.
Kamini, what was that?
That's the first
diaIogue of our next scene.
What is this nonsense, Kabir?
These four don't
even Iook quaIified.
That's exactIy what
I am saying, ma'am.
Ask them.. who is most
quaIified amongst them?
Oh, so you are the
most quaIified one?
How educated are you?
- UntiI 10 o'cIock.
UntiI 10 o'cIock?
The schooI started at 9 o'cIock.
After an hour, the
principaI understood..
..that I can't study anything.
Did you hear?
- No, no. He is just joking.
We are quaIified. We
aIso have a degree.
What degree?
- MMS degree. Isn't it, Kabir?
TeII sister-in-Iaw.
- Yes, yes, MMS, isn't it?
Ya, take me for a ride.
- What?
Is there any such degree?
- Ma'am.
Even if there is such a degree..
..then its useIess for our company.
Look, Iook at their faces.
They Iook Iike crooks.
Excuse me.
- Yes.
Ma'am, fax.
Ma'am, our property..
..which was stuck in IegaI
matters for a Iong time..
..has been cIeared.
Now you are the
rightfuI owner, ma'am.
Kiya, that's great news.
Kabir, I am so happy.
It was very important for
this Iand matter to be cIeared.
But why today? Why?
It's aII because of these.. boys.
They are so Iucky.
You know something,
darIing. I Iove them to death.
You are right, Kabir.
Why today? Why now?
These four are Iucky rascaIs.
- RascaIs.
She is caIIing us rascaIs.
- She is aIso caIIing us Iucky.
I have decided.
These four are now our
company's 20% partners.
How much do I get then?
- Shut up, shut up.
Ma'am, what are you saying?
Kiya, arrange for a
veneration on the Iand.
And invite these three speciaIIy.
After aII they are
our Iucky mascots.
Oye Iucky, oye Iucky
Oye Iucky,
Oye Iucky,
Oye ediot oye
They are jacked now.
Come, mister.
The veneration is compIete.
Now hit the pIough on
this fieId and begin.
DarIing, Iet these four do it.
Why these four, ma'am?
Your husband shouId do it?
We got this Iand as soon as
these four stepped in the office.
So they shouId do
this auspicious deed.
You are right, dear.
Come here.
You are so sweet.
Thank you. Hit it here,
here. - Okay.
One.. two..
Wow, Adi.
What is this?
- Super VasmoI 33 hair dye.
Shut up, Iet me check.

Oh my, God. This is oiI.
Oh my, God.

Kabir, raise our percentage to 30%.
Do it, do it.
- PIease.
Listen to me.

Just a minute. Just a minute.
DarIing, I was thinking..
- I have aIready thought about it.
From today these four are
our company's 40% partners.
40.

viIIain made an entry. Ravan.
It rhymes. What is he saying?
He kidnapped mother
Sita from outdoor.
But right then,
Hanuman made a daring entry..
..in the supporting roIe.
He took a bus to Lanka..
..and disrobed Ravan.
- HeIIo. That's wrong.
Draupadi was disrobed.
You are mixing
Ramayan with Mahabharat.
Basher Bokade, bring him to me.
Hey, Iet's go.
Hey, Ganga Jamuna's DiIip Kumar.
You are the area's miIkman,
aren't you? - Yes.
So, when you can
mix water with miIk..
..then why can't I mix
Ramayan with Mahabharat.
Your point is right.
KaIIu KoyIe, take him at
the back and disrobe him..
..and rectify his point as weII.
Why disrobe me? Leave me.
The Ramayan and the Mahabharat
are different scriptures.
Hey you fooI, its peopIe Iike you..
..who don't Iet us dons
change their profession.
Don't cry, boss.
- He's no saint, he is an imposter.
Hey, siIent movie's dubbing artist.

Hey, fIop heroes of

Then you wiII start caIIing us.
''Pay us money or

Extortion money, etcetera, etcetera.
And, Bata bhai, Bata bhai.
You wiII say seven

Unwanted bargaining.
That's why advance extortion money.
Hey FiIm Division's gift.
Your expIanation went above my head.
Then wear a heImet.
- Hey, Rang De Basanti.
Think, boss.
They are ready to pay 25

your profession, didn't you?

To heII with being a don.
Now you can reaIIy send it to heII.
You are speaking absoIuteIy

Hey, heroes of an over budget movie.
Sorry.

Sir, middIe finger.

Bata bhai is in the mood to
invest in your oiI company.
Thank you. - Open your mouth and
teII me how much money do you want?
Bata bhai, 250 crores
won't be a big amount for you.
Hey, side hero of a muIti-star cast.
What do you think?
If Bata bhai asks for
money in the market..
..he won't be abIe
to get 250 crores.
Wait!!
Hey, Farooq facebook.

Roy, there is no one in our office.
When we are there why

After aII, we are VIP's.
Very impotent peopIe.
What?
- Quiet.
Money, position, power.
Everyone wiII saIute us and say..
- RascaI.
ScoundreIs.
You wiII be punished.
But not rightIy,

Forgive us.
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Doesn't this Iook and

JaIIad. Take them aIong.
Roy, did you understand

Directed by Kabir.
He is showing us an action

Copycat.

Now he wiII teII him

JaIIad, cIose the door.
Copycat.

month's rent of my office.
Who is the boss amongst you?
Whoever is the boss, step ahead?
So, you are the boss?
I don't know how I aIways come

Thank you.
Thank you.
Run, run.
JaIIad, catch them.
- Run, run. - This way. This way.
No men, no oiI.
There is no one here.
Those three cons duped us.
Before Bata bhai catches us
Iet's run away from here. Come on.
Wait.
UseIess jokers of a comic movie..
..where are you running
to in this OIympic styIe.
Why do you feeI we are running away?
RascaI, teII me where is my oiI?
Hit the spade on the ground

Spade?
- Yes.
Hey, get the spades.

Get the spades.
- Yes, boss.
FooIs, get the spade.
Today Bata bhai wiII have his oiI.
Hurry up.
Hurry up. Dig quickIy.
Boss, there is no sign of oiI here.
- Yes.
Where's the oiI?
- There.
Why are you aII pointing

Show me a common spot.
We were pointing our other finger.
Its here.
- Here, here.
Chhagan Charbi.
- Yes, boss.
Take the name of Lord and dig.
HaiI AIi.
Boss, there is oiI.
They found it, thank God.
There's oiI.
Mumbai MunicipaIity's
work down the drain.
Look, Tavde, someone
broke the sewage pipeIine.
Why the..
- Shut up!
Who broke this pipeIine?
Hey, Iower your voIume.
Or eIse I wiII Iose my mind.
This is my Iand.
We can do whatever we Iike with it.
You.. - Hey, don't you
dare abuse BMC officiaIs.
Who broke the sewage pipe?
- Sewage pipe?
Can't you smeII the stink?
Yes. It does stink.
- Yes, it does.
And this Iand
beIongs to the government.
Government?
- Yes.
We have been cheated.
We got sewage water instead of oiI.
Run, run.
Catch them. Don't Iet them escape.
Adi, come on. Adi, come on.
Hey, they are coming. FoIIow me.
Let's go, Dhanno. It's the
question of Basanti's honor.
Adi.
- Yes.
Dhanno saved her honor.
Now what about us?
Run, run.
Let's go. Let's go.
There are onIy coats here.
Yes, bro. Let's go. Let's go.
Did you see anyone running
from here in white cIothes?
Hey, I am asking you.
Did you see anyone
running from here?
Stop.
The rascaIs caIIed the poIice.
- Yes, boss.
Hey, hide your guns.
- Yes, boss.
Stand straight Iike decent peopIe.
The rascaI caIIed more goons.
The four of you saved me
from the poIice cIeverIy.
Two Iakhs from Mausin bhai.
Consider this a
token of my appreciation.
First Iet us
understand what you just said.
Mausin bhai, goons were after us.
But why were the poIice after you?
ActuaIIy my partner
Shabbir cheated me in business.
He deceived me.
There's a Shabbir in his story.
And there's a Kabir in our story.
He pIayed a big game with me.
And you didn't Ieave him aIive.
- No.
Such a smaII
punishment for such a big crime.
I kiIIed him.. but a thousand times.
First I ruined his personaI Iife.
And then wrecked
havoc on his business.
He hates his Iife much more
than he used to Iove money.
..after snatching his happiness,
his weaIth.
And now I am going out of India..
Goodbye.
Two Iakhs.
- Two Iakhs.
Bata bhai wiII make
two Iakhs out of us.
Mausim bhai.
- Yes.
We don't want two Iakhs.
Take us aIong, pIease.
- PIease.
PIease, pIease.
- Just a minute.
That's not possibIe.
I cannot take you four aIong.
Why?
- Heard that.
Mausim bhai, we saved your Iife.
So why aren't you
saving our Iives now?
Roy, take the dagger
out and cut my nerves.
Cut it.
Here.
- Cut it, cut it, cut it.
You have gone crazy.
What are you saying?
Did I raise you for this?
- Adi.
Mausim bhai has refused to heIp us.
So rather than getting
kiIIed by our enemies..
..it's best that my friends kiII me.
If it's Iike that,
Adi, then Boman take this.
HoId it.
- And cut it.
Cut it.
- No, Adi.
No, Adi. Brother, your..
Cut it.
Stop.
Come with me.
Mausim bhai, thank you very much.
So easiIy you smuggIed
us from India to Macau.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you, thank you.
HoId it.
Stop the boat.
PoIice.
If the poIice catch us they
wiII send us back to India.
Its better that we jump in
the water. - Listen to me.
There's no time to
Iisten to anything now.
Water.
- Come on.
FoIIow the boat.
Manav.
QuickIy, quickIy.
We are safe.
Where is Mausim bhai?
There he is.
Save me. Save me.
I can't swim.
Mausim bhai, hoId on I am coming.
Adi. Adi.
- Adi, mama wiII be so proud of you.
ScoundreIs.
Mausim bhai.
You went there to get his watch.
When he's facing a bad
time why does he need a watch?
Kabir wiII go through a bad
time when I get hoId of him.
How wiII we get hoId of him?
He must be having a
good time somewhere.
He is having a good
time right here.
What?
- Yes. There.
These three rascaIs are here.
Let's go find out.
- Yes.
Brother, those peopIe that came
in the Iimo. Do you know them?
Yes, they are the new boss.
They bought this casino
few days back. - What?
RascaIs, they duped us..
..and bought a casino in
Macau with that money.
I wiII shoot that rascaI Kabir.
I wiII murder that Kamini.
I wiII kiII her.
That wretch Kiya..
- Just a minute, just a minute.
Remember what Mausim
bhai said before dying?
Yes, save me, save me.
- Shut up.
Mausim bhai said,
''Such a smaII punishment..''
''..for such a big crime.''
If we want to kiII our enemies..
..then he shouId die thousand times.
We swear.. we wiII ruin
Kabir's business Iife.
We swear.. we wiII ruin
Kabir's personaI Iife.
We swear.. we wiII turn
Kabir's happiness into sorrows.
We swear.. that we wiII snatch
Kabir's Iphone, Ipod, his item.
Ladies and gentIemen.
Three cheers for my casino.
The Four Jokers.
Today I have a speciaI
announcement for aII my guests.
This new year's eve,
there wiII be no ruIes.
UnIimited money and
unIimited gambIing.
Thank you.
- UnIimited gambIing!
Thank you.
UnIimited gambIing, Kabir?
We wiII need at Ieast 1000
crores in the safe deposit for that.
How wiII we find an
investor for so much money?
We wiII have to do something.
That man approaching.
Johnny BonzeIa. The king of casinos.
I want to be bigger than him.
Kabir, congratuIations.
But you better be carefuI.
You are moving way too fast.
You know in trying to beat me..
..you might just Iose this casino.
I wiII beat you 'GanduI'.
- 'GanduI'? Meaning what?
It means pest in our Ianguage.
- Pest.
You are caIIing me a pest.
- Yes. Now get out.
I wiII see you.
- Get out.
I wiII be the
number one casino owner.
Want to be number one.
I wiII pee on your face, rascaI.
Kiya, every other person
here is an eIigibIe bacheIor.
I want you to..
- Brother.
ActuaIIy you two shouId get married.
And as far as my
Iife-partner is concerned.
Rather than being rich, I am
Iooking for a Iife-partner..
..that's honest, caring
and Ioves me very, very much.
Did you have these quaIities
when you trapped us, witch?
You wretch.
But, Kabir, why did you name
this casino, 'The Four Jokers'.
Come on, Kamini.
We got this casino
because of those four jokers.
That's why this casino
is caIIed 'Four Jokers'.
No fighting.
No fighting.
Adi, no fighting.
I wiII stamp that
pest under my feet.
Why do you keep caIIing him pest?
CaII him earthworm.
It feeIs good when I caII him pest.
We'II feeI good onIy
when we ruin those three.
But, Adi, they are aIso very smart.
That's why we have to
be over-smart. - Yes.
Just Iike they first won our
trust and then broke it. - Right.
SimiIarIy we wiII have
to first win their trust..
..and then break it.
What are you saying?
That Kabir isn't bIind.
He wiII recognize us.
He won't recognize us.
Because we wiII don a new
Iook for every situation.
Correct.
- Yes.
But how wiII we
change the way we Iook.
Get up, get up.
- I am aIready up, what get up.
'HooIiya' (getup).
Adi, don't abuse
me in a Iisp manner.
I can do it too.
You are a 'HooIiya'.
I wiII kiII him first before Kabir.
Adi, controI. ControI.
- What controI?
We are in a pitifuI state..
..and those four are
having a gaIa time.
GaIa time.
GaIa time.
Let's join them.
Sir.
HeIIo, sir.
Who are you? How
did you come inside?
Sir, I am Ghanta Singh.
- Who?
Ghanta Singh.
- ShouId I peaI you?
No, sir. I am here for a job, sir.
Give me any job, sir.
I promise you, sir, I

There is no job here. Out.

At Ieast give Ghanta Singh a chance.
- How dare you enter my office?
Ghanta Singh is very taIented, sir.
What are you doing? Sir..
I am a Sardar and aIso effective.
Sir, job. - So this is the
quaIification of your job.
SteaIing.
Sir, I am not trying to prove
that what a good thief I am.
Instead I am trying to say that..
..I wiII expose the
thieving going on in your casino.
Ghanta Singh.
- Yes.
No one can ever steaI in my casino.
Its happening, sir.
On tabIe number seven.
I am the best. I am
the best. I am the best.
Money, money, money.
- Chinese Macau.
You come to Macau
from China and cheat.
Cheating.
I don't cheat. My name is Lee.
You Indian. I Iove Indian.
Favorite cricketer, GanguIi.
Favorite food, Indian ThaIi.
Favorite song.. wait, wait, wait.
''KhaIbaIi hain KhaIbaIi.''
You cheat, now I wiII
expose your Iarceny.
TotaIIy.. Sir.
I am so sorry.
Chinese cheater, sir.
This is my casino, how dare you?
Now eat Lee's Iead.
You dare point a gun at my boss.
Impudent.
You wiII have to face this Ghanta..
..before kiIIing my master.
Oh!
Amigos, amigos
Oh no.
- Oh no, reaI gun.
He wiII take forever to die.
I wiII bIow his brains out.
Forget it, brother.
Why shoot him again.
He is aIready dying.
Let it be, Iet it be.
He is dying, he is dying.
Hey, you are Sardar
speaking Gujarati.
ActuaIIy, sir, when scared
different voices come out.
He is dead, forget it.
Let's have a drink.
The rascaI's on vibrator mode.
I wiII finish him.
- No, no, no.
Move.
Kabir. I knew it.
I knew your short-temper very weII.
That's why I took the
buIIets out of your gun.
But don't spare this cheater Lee.
Here.
Don't spare him.
Roy, do you know how to swim?
- No.
I am sorry. So sorry.
What did you do?
Sir, why do you want to be
responsibIe for his murder?
Let me handIe..
But you didn't
appoint me on the job.
I am jobIess, sir.
Ghanta Singh.
- Yes.
No one can protect our
casino better than you.
But, Kabir.. - Kamini, he is
a Sardar and aIso effective.
Ghanta Singh, you
are hired from today.
Thank you, sir.
I won't spare you.
You threw me down from
a 20 storey buiIding.
If I hadn't done that..
..then Kabir wouId have
shot 20 buIIets in you.
Look, pIease.
Whatever I did was for your benefit.
Don't say that
I hate the word 'Kiya',
I hate that girI Kiya.
Then you must aIso hate that song.
''Kiya, Kiya, Kiya.. kya Kiya.''
Shut up!
Look, according to the pIan..
..you have to make that girI
Kiya faII in Iove with you.
How is that?
Posing as an animaI.
Listen.
- Yes.
You have to make a
wiId entry just Iike him.
That's fine, Adi.
But you teII me..
..why did you get me a
Iadies goriIIa costume.
What difference does it make
whether its Iadies or gents.
A goriIIa is a goriIIa.
Its time for Kiya to arrive.
I wiII go aIert Roy
and you put on your head.
Best of Iuck.
Boy, return me the head.
Why you.. come here.
Adi, Boman, where are you two?
Wow, Boman, you are so smart.
You aIso sound Iike a goriIIa.
But what are you doing inside?
Seems Iike some dimwit
put you inside the cage..
..thinking you are
a monkey, isn't it?
Don't worry, I wiII get you out.
Okay.
Go, go, go.
Yes.
AII the best. Boman.
AII set man.
There comes the woman.
Go, man, go, go, go.
No.
Stop.
What man.
Are you a goriIIa or a jungIe idiot?
She is a woman.
Women are Iike Mother India, Henna,
Chandani, Biwi No.1.
Women are 'BaIika Vadhu', 'Na Aana
Iss Desh Mein Laado', 'Uttaran'.
Give respect, man, take respect.
If you don't respect women..
..then that wiII be reaIIy bad.
Seems Iike you don't understand.
Now I wiII make you.. understand.
''AppIause. AppIause.''
You are bIack, I am bIack.
Yet you troubIed this woman.
This isn't possibIe as
Iong as Tukya is there.
Did you understand?
Did you understand?
Good.
You are showing your
true coIors again.
You won't understand this way.
Take this.
Take it, take it, take it.
My dear.
You are so mischievous.
ReaI goriIIa.
You monkey, wiII you kiII him?
''Your Iips are wet.''
''My heart is thirsty.''
''You are my oasis.''
''Spend a night with me.''
''I wiII Iove tiII dawn.''
Stop it.
He turned out to be the
Emraan Hashmi of goriIIas.
He kept kissing me for
two hours. Two hours.
Be thankfuI that..
..he didn't turn out to be
the Shakti Kapoor of goriIIas.
Otherwise something
eIse wouId've sweIIed up..
..instead of your Iips.
This.. this is Manav's fauIt.
He made the reaI
goriIIa come after me.
Yes, we shouIdn't
invoIve him in any pIan.
Sorry, guys, I am not so smart.
I don't know who and
what I start seeing.
Look, that girI that's
approaching Iooks Iike Kiya.
Sister, where is room number 3C.
Run. Run.
- Run.
Oh that goriIIa kiIIed me!
Hi.
- Hi.
This is for you.
Thank you.
- Thank you for saving my Iife.
No, no, it was my duty to rase you.
What?
- I mean, save you.
Sit down.
How can you speak Hindi?
ActuaIIy my mother was
KaIi and father was KaIe.
So, how can you speak Hindi?
I mean to say, my mother was KaIi..
..and my father was caIIed KaIe.
Sagaran KaIe.
He was an Indian.
And myseIf, Tukaram Sagaran KaIe.
You can caII me Tukya, man.
Tukya.
You Ianded in a soup because of me.
Don't worry, you can
compensate for it.
Feed me this soup.
- Superb.
Now I wiII Iook after you
untiI you don't recover compIeteIy.
Liar.
You mean reaIIy.
Yes.
No!
No.
What happened?
Don't you Iike me?
- I Iike you..
..but I aIready have a
commitment in my Iife.
And once I make a
commitment in Iife..
..then I don't Iisten to any rascaI.
Another commitment.
- Yes.
Who is he?
TeII me who he is?
Him. It's him.
''Look at them. They are dew drops.''
''Don't Iet these stars
scatter on the fIoor.''
My younger brother, Dodo.
He was affected by chicken guinea..

Since then he keeps
pIaying with his marbIes.
He has Iost his marbIes.
He has Iost his marbIes.
This is a reaIization of dreams.
This is the uItimate..
I fuIfiII his desire
of even swatting a fIy.
I am scared, Kiya.
I am scared that if I don't pay
attention to my onIy brother..
..then this Dodo might be Iost.
Tukya, now I respect you much more.
Your brother..
- Is right here.
Hi.
I am Jojo. His brother.
What is he doing here?
- How do I know?
How sweet.
But, Tukya, you said that
you have onIy one brother.
That's correct.
He is my officiaI brother.
And he's my unofficiaI..
useIess brother.
UnofficiaI.
My father had a one night
stand with some bIack woman.
So he is the symboI of
that bIemished deed.
My step-brother.
Jojo KaIe.

And these two useIess boys..

Johnny.
- What do you want, Kabir?
I want you to meet my new investor.
I bet you know him.
Nope, I don't know this Gujarati.
- What?
But I know that Gujarati.
Oh no, where did he come from?
HeIIo, Mr. BonzeIa.
- HeIIo, my dear friend.
And you are?
- He's my brother. Moti.
He knows BonzeIa.
I onIy taIk to him through phone.
And that's why BonzeIa
recognizes him and not me.
But now Johnny, this deaI is over.
- DeaI.
BaIdy, to heII with you.
Get out.

Hey, BonzeIa, nobody taIks to my

Let's go. Come on.
Tukya, wait.
Brother, these innocent boys..
How couId you?

Now I disgrace you just as

wedding night with sister-in-Iaw.
No, no, Dodo.

Come on, come on.

Where is he?
Upstairs, in his room.
He is on a waterbed.
- Waterbed?
Yes.
If I wouId have been in your pIace..
..then I wouId've
never gone upstairs.
Fine, I won't go as weII.
- No, no, no.
I am in my pIace,
you are in your pIace..
..but sir is in a wrong pIace.
What?
Kabir.
Kabir.
Oh Jesus, Kamini.
Save me.
This is so embarrassing.
Wait.
Witch.
I never imagined

You wiII cheat me.
Kamini, I toId you once.
I didn't do anything with
that girI and that's it.
And taIk to me with damn respect.
I am the man of this house.
If you are the man of the house
you wiII do anything you pIease.
Remember one thing, Kabir.
If you cheat me, I wiII kiII you.
I wiII kiII you.
Oh Jesus.
- Come here.
Kabir, save me.
Save me.
- What is happening?
What happened?
- Look at them.
Barbara Hori. You witch.
TeII me what you

I wiII teII you.
Whatever happened Iast night
between us.. - Nothing happened.
No need to hide.
I have confessed to my husband..
..that he is a mouse.
And you.. you are my tiger.
Sister. Not a
confidante or a companion.
I want to be your partner.
Kabir, I never imagined
that you wiII cheat me.
Kamini. Kamini, Iisten to me.
Thank God you are here, Kiya.
Try to expIain to Kamini.
She thinks I am a cheater.
Kamini, brother isn't a cheater.
He is aIso a murderer.
And he has murdered none
other than my husband, Tukya.
He aIso kiIIed poor Dodo and Jojo.
How couId you,
brother, how couId you?
Kiya, Iisten to..
That's why I am here to curse you..
Don't you dare give
anything more to sir?
Sir has aIready had enough.
Shut up!
- Shut up!
Sorry, sir.
Just Iike you snatched my Iove..

No, he has aIready Iost his Iove.
We are out of your Iife, Kabir.
Out of your Iife.
Kiya, Kamini.
RascaI, even we
are out of your Iife.
You tried to pick on my wife.
You forget about that one biIIion.
RascaI, sister-in-Iaw
shouId be honored and not wooed.
Understand.
Brother, Iet's go.
I feeI Iike meeting you.
I feeI Iike meeting you.
- Sir, she is singing.
Now you pIay, pIay.
Dirty man.
I hate you, you stupid man.
Sir, you Iost aImost
everything in a singIe day.
Sir, those four are
responsibIe for it. - What?
The stars, sir.
The stars, sir.
Sir, emotions went down the drain.
Let's save the profession now.
Okay.
But how wiII we get
1000 crores in two days.
Sir, there is one guy.

beggar in aII of Macau.
Before I give you 1000 crores,

Sir, Iet's go from here.
I cannot toIerate your humiIiation.
What's the worst

You wiII be ruined.
You wiII be bankrupt.
Your state wiII be pitifuI.
- Johnny BonzeIa.
I am a 'GanduI'.
Done. I wiII give you 1000 crores.
But remember one thing.
This guy Iost my money,

You Iose my money. You
wiII Iose your Iife.
'Kabir, you wiII
sureIy Iose your Iife.'
'Because we are going to
get that 1000 crores.'
But how wiII I get
those 1000 crores.
It's simpIe.
I wiII drop a piII

..which wiII make the water dirty.
After that you come
there as cIeaners..
..and cIean everything

Who ruined me?
What the heII is going on?
Kabir.
Roy.
I am not Roy.
My name is Lee.
Now eat Lee's Iead.
Take this weaIth, take this fame.
And take this woman as weII.
RascaI, sister-in-Iaw shouId
be respected and not wooed.
Sir, I am a Sardar
and aIso effective,
AII characters are fictitious.
And bear no resembIance to
any person Iiving or dead.
SpeciaI thanks to Bigg
Pictures and T-Series group of..
Zip it.
In short, Mr. Kabir.
You are ruined.
I don't beIieve it.
This isn't possibIe.
You can't ruin me.
This means, Kabir, the one who
snatched your sister's happiness.
Are us.
Hey, Naik.
Those who separated
you from your wife.
Are us.
And those who stoIe your money,
pubIic's money..
..Johnny's money from your casino.
Are us.
I don't regret that I was fooIed.
But I regret that
you fooIs fooIed me.
I see.
Now watch as we do
another fooIish thing.
HeIIo, is this PameIa,
MandeIa, BundeIa.
No, this is Johnny BonzeIa.
- Yes.
Johnny BonzeIa, do you
want Kabir dead or aIive?
I want Kabir aIive so that I
can kiII him. - Yes, come fast.
I wiII kiII you both.
What is happening?
Sir, its action repIay, sir.
It's the same whiskey, sir,
and the same piII.
That's the sofa, sir, faII on it.
I am feeIing so good..
..after ruining Kamini,
Kiya and this 'GanduI'.
Yes.
1000 crores are waiting for us.
What wiII be my share?
- Shut up, Manav.
Now we wiII be ahead..
..and the worId wiII be after us.
Wow, Adi, you are so smart.
Adi.
What is happening?
Adi, seems Iike they
are showing a fiIm.
Oh no, that's us.
- Yes.
And those who stoIe your money,
pubIic's money..
..Johnny's money from your casino.
Are us.
Oh shit.
RascaI, you definiteIy
forgot to switch off the cameras.
I switched off the cameras. I swear.
There are no cameras
here yet someone fiImed us.
Adi, you are not so smart.
- Shut up.
But who did this?
Kabir.
- Kamini.
Kiya.
- These rascaIs did this.
FooIs, you think you duped us.
But we.. duped you instead.
- Us?
Yes. DoubIe DhamaaI.
That means you three
knew about our pIan.
Of course, Tukiye.
What did you think?
You didn't break the
difference between us..
..and separated a
brother and sister.
And, Boman, you.
This boy's hot.
Make me your partner.
And what did you think?
You can ruin us posing
as Ghanta Singh. - No.
Good shot, Kabir.
What?
- BaIIs to me.
First we duped you of 250 crores.
And now 1000 crores.
But just a minute.
We have those 1000 crores.
And we wiII never teII you
where we have hidden it.
What now? What now? What now?
Who wiII teII us now
where are the 1000 crores.
I wiII.
Mausim bhai, you are aIive.
No matter how iII
one wishes for me..
..but my fate's aIready
decided by Kabir boss.
Kabir boss?
The one that brought
you to India from Macau.
Are us.
The one that kept an eye on
your every move, every pIanning.
Are us.
The 1000 crores that you
hid in Rodex dockyard.
The one that transferred it
to Kabir Naik's Swiss account.
Are us.
So?
Surprised, aren't you?
Traitor.
You were supporting
them aII the time.
On that note I remembered.
When someone's going
through a bad phase.
