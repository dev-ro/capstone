GATE ONLY FOR PRISONERS
Ulrik!
We want to wish you good luck.
- For the rest of your Life.
- Alright. Thank you.
Look, Ulrik. Once you
step out of that gate, -
Look forward. Never Look back. Forward.
Deal?
Forward, Ulrik. Forward.
- Ulrik
- Yeah.
- It's been a while.
- 12 years.
Time sure goes fast. I thought
you'd be getting out Thursday.
No, no.
- Do you want anything?
- A cup of coffee.
Coffee.
- Have you been travelling?
- Something Like that.
It's on the house.
Get out!
I don't want your money!
What are you doing?
- I thought you were getting out tomorrow.
- No.
- They told me that.
- I got out today.
Why did they tell me
you'd get out tomorrow?
- I got out today.
- Are you sure?
Hug him, Rolf
- What are you drinking?
- Coffee.
- Three cups of coffee.
- Not for me.
- We're drinking coffee with Ulrik
- But...
Three cups of coffee.
God damn! Shit.
- What are we doing here?
- Jensen's big sister lives here.
- Is that him?
- Take it easy, Karen Margarethe.
Ulrik
- Can he pay?
- Pay? He's a mechanic.
A mechanic.
Rolf
The toilet is down the hall.
You buy your own toilet paper.
This is a lot like your cell.
Are you being funny?
- Did you visit mom and dad's grave?
- Yes.
- Did you take them flowers?
- I did.
- Isn't this good enough for you?
- It is. It's quite good.
Let's deal with the
money-issues right away.
Eight.
Welcome
- Now you have a roof over your head.
- I want to thank you, Jensen.
For everything. For the
money you gave Wenche and Geir.
For everything.
I Look after my own, Ulrik
God damn.
- Welcome to your new home.
- What's that?
- It's a welcoming gift. You told me to...
- You bought a star-eye.
A star-eye.
- I just grabbed something.
- These are women's flowers
- I don't know anything about flowers
- I can see that.
But you know.
Ulrik..
We found him.
Alright
We know where he works, but
we don't know where he lives
Calm down. He just got out of
jail We'll do this nice and slow
He works here in Alnabru.
Tall that bastard and
find out where he lives
Try to figure out where we'll do it.
It's time to settle the score.
- Storing those boxes cost
a Lot of money. - Thank you.
- I have feelings too.
- Thank you.
Don't smoke in bed.
What do you want?
Are you Sven?
Perhaps.
I'm a mechanic. Jensen said
you might have work for me.
I haven't worked in a while
For 12 years.
I don't know what you were
doing, and I don't want to know.
You did a 12-year stint and now
you've paid your debt to society.
Everyone deserves a new chance
in order to ensure their future.
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.
- Sven.
- Ulrik
You start at seven on Monday.
Ulrik
Hello, Ulrik
- Show him the coffee-maker
- It's right there.
Show him where it is.
There. Are you satisfied now?
Did you do time?
- For what?
- Murder.
- Who did you kill?
- A man.
- How?
- I shot him.
And?
You're supposed to be
a better person now?
I don't think people
can become better people
No.
Don't even try to sleep with me.
You buy your own milk Sven and
I don't use milk on our coffee.
Let's Look at this weather-map
Strong winds are arriving on the coast.
On the days to come...
In southern Norway...
... calm weather. In
Finnmark and Tromssa...
... during the afternoon...
I cook too much.
I'll throw it out if you don't eat it.
- Smells good.
- Anyone can cook a cod.
I don't have any cutlery
Eat.
- What did you do to the TV?
- I don't know.
- Is that a Russian channel?
- Polish
Don't get funny with me.
- Tastes good.
- I know.
- Can you win something there?
- Apparently a car.
The picture is clear
Do you think that blond is pretty?
Henriksen found him.
By chance.
He was getting rid of his fridge,
and the man was working there.
It was plain Luck
Chance and Luck are the same.
Not quite.
Chance can be something bad, Luck can't.
Shut up, Rolf
I was right.
- That's him.
- It sure is.
- You don't have to kill him.
- Do you have any suggestions?
You could break his arms as a warning.
Ulrik was in jail for 12
years because of that snitch.
Do you think he can take that?
There has to be some
justice in this world
My people don't Leave scores unsettled
Stay away from Merete.
She's not your type.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
This movie sucks.
That bearded man is the girl's father.
- Why do they need the horse?
- They're trying to win money.
- Why?
- To get money for a surgery.
- What surgery?
- Eye surgery.
The child went blind in the accident.
But the jockey is possessed by
that man with the eyeglasses
- He's her father.
- No, he tried to kiss her.
But it's Poland
The food was good.
- Terrible film
- Thanks for the food.
- Hey!
- Hello.
- Is Merete here?
- She comes in at nine.
At nine? I'm here early
Hey. I'm Kristian. I'm her husband.
- My hands are dirty.
- That's alright.
Tell her that her husband came
by, and will come back soon.
Hey.
Your husband says hello.
- My husband?
- He said his name is Kristian.
I know his bloody name.
He said he'd come by soon again.
- He was here?
- Yes.
Don't touch me!
- Who's the husband?
- We don't talk about him.
- He came by.
- You just don't stop, do you?
They're divorced and he
has a restraining order.
I don't understand men and women.
You hurt even when you Love
I think Kristian Loves Merete a great
deal At Least he hurts her a great deal
Merete has Lost her belief
in the concept of Love
Some children are hurt more than others.
Sven!
His medication.
It's his heart again.
I'll call an ambulance
I'm going to the hospital again.
We need to keep this workshop open.
I trust you, Ulrik
People rely on us to fix their cars.
They can't live without their cars.
They have to go shopping, pick
kids up from daycare, go to work.
This place can't be shut down because
of some ventricular fibrillation
The world just passes by.
Ulrik!
Summer tires, winter tires.
The world can't stop turning.
They're coming, Sven.
- Let's close up for the day.
- I promised I'd keep it open.
See any cars that need fixing?
Does he hit you?
Let's both keep to our own business,
and everything will be wunderbar.
Tasted good. Thanks for the food.
Come on. Since you feel like it.
Do you need me to write
you an invitational Letter?
Lord in heaven!
My god!
Lord in heaven!
Jesus Christ!
Don't get any ideas.
- Is everything good?
- All is fine.
You can pay your debts
when you feel up to it.
3 75 a year for the storage and 12
times 1500 to the kid for 12 years.
- That's about 215000.
- 216000.
- We were thinking about the plan
- What?
Have you been tailing him?
I don't have a car.
Be careful with the
shifts. Two doesn't work.
You can't trust the gas meter.
I trust you. You have
to settle the score.
Don't smoke in the car.
- I see. You got out.
- Yes.
I thought you weren't
getting out until next month.
- How are things?
- How do you think?
What do you want me to say?
I respect what you did.
You did what needed to be done in
the situation. I like that in a man.
But you ruined our lives,
and that I will never forgive.
- Did you get the money?
- Yes. Once a month.
I was alone with a 13-year old boy.
I had to live with what I made off
of this diner and with Jensen's 1500.
''Forget about him, Geir'', I
said when you went to jail
''You no Longer have a
father. Forget about him. ''
And that he has. He no Longer
talks of you. You're gone.
He has a girlfriend
and his own apartment.
He's a grown man.
He's studying to be an engineer.
An electrical engineer.
Leave him alone
You've always eaten with such grace.
You haven't got Laid in 12 years?
I haven't.
I'll give you a quickie.
After all, we were Lovers once.
Are you coming?
Stay away from him. He
is no Longer your son.
He no Longer has a father.
That's just the way things are.
We're just two old farts.
It's just best to be quiet
and hope not to get ill
- Hello.
- Hello, son. It's your father.
- What?
- Ulrik
I can Leave if you want.
Thanks.
- I just got out.
- I see.
- I never heard from you.
- I know.
You could've sent me a postcard.
Circle out the window of
your cell. ''I live here. ''
Hello!
Hi.
- Hi.
- He's Ulrik My uncle.
- Hi.
- Hello, uncle Ulrik
I didn't know that Geir has an uncle.
- He travels a Lot
- All the time.
- To exciting and exotic locales?
- Yes.
- Like Poland
- Poland?
- Poland?
- Poland
I have to go. I got a job
at a maintenance station.
- Tell me if your car needs fixing.
- We don't have a car.
I've told her that my father is dead.
It was the easiest thing to do.
- Bye then.
- Bye.
The same people sell guns now.
It isn't like the old days, when
the Norwegians were in charge.
I miss the times when we took stolen cars into
Poland and returned with a boat full of liquor
- We need to stay cool now.
- What? Rolf, you're not coming with us.
You watch the car. One can't Leave a
Mercedes unwatched around these parts.
Sit on the footstool, Rolf
God damn is he tiny.
Hey, shorty. Are mom and dad home?
Who got you pregnant?
Uncle-Otto sends his regards.
Who the fuck comes up
with these retarded names?
- We don't.
- Fuck Uncle-Otto
Sit.
Benelli, . 22, official model,
made in Korea. Polygon-barrel.
A stable, precise gun.
Tangfogllo. A Long slider, the trigger is shaped like
a cube, extended clip, single shot, nut-wood handle.
Manurhin. French military
revolver, . 9, iron sights.
Bul M-5. An Israeli. 40, big clip release pin,
polymeric framing, light and fast with precise aim.
Glock 1 7. Straight from Austria. Firing
pin safety, 1 7 rounds, plastic overmolding.
- What the hell is this?
- A Ruger.
Do you think we're in a
flea market? Fuck this gun.
Hi, Joha. At the hotel
How's the menu?
Listen! That restaurant is mine!
I've told that gook-eyed bitch
that we serve sour fish sushi!
Tell the chef that I will shove a barrel
full of sour fish up his ass unless he obeys!
Yes. Bye then.
9000. 11000. 12000.
12600. 14000. 13400.
- Could you get that bike pump out of here?
- Alright.
Don't care about the money, it's on me.
Good choice.
Take the car, Ulrik. Use a
few days to Learn his ways.
Rolf!
- Are you insane?
- It was just waiting there.
- Don't we steal cars any more?
- We don't. Get in.
Damn, was that midget tiny.
They're called dwarfs, Rolf.
- It isn't the same.
- It's just a different expression.
That same kid was short. His mom
wanted him to be tall and handsome.
The midget's mom always knew, that he wouldn't
be winning the high jump-Olympics any time soon.
You shouldn't mock something
that can't be helped
- Look who's talking.
- I wasn't the one making fun about midgets.
I wasn't making fun about midgets.
- Three coffees.
- I'd like some tea.
I fixed the car. The gas meter was fine.
Great.
I won't do it.
- You won't do it?
- I won't.
The Pakistanis, Albanians,
Arabs, Russians, Romanians.
This country is full of people
who want to rule the weak.
No man is stronger than his crew.
If the crew is weak, so is he.
You're in my crew, Ulrik.
Henriksen had an ileostomy. He's walking
around with a bag of shit on his stomach.
Gunnar had a stroke and
can't even speak properly.
You never know what he's
saying and he drools.
He drools.
If my crew is weak, so am I. If I appear to be
weak, those bastards will think they can rule Jensen.
I Looked after your son
when you were in prison.
They got money once a month.
It's my revenge.
Life goes on.
Life doesn't go on.
It stops if someone
doesn't settle their scores.
That someone Loses his friends.
Loses his woman. Loses everything.
Nothing is free, Ulrik.
You must make a choice.
Do you want to settle with
me or with that snitch?
Me or the snitch?
I choose you, Jensen.
I see.
Rolf! We know no one from this place.
Make the slaves to
debt Leave their seats.
Closing time.
It's supper.
You're getting dessert
today. A fruit cocktail.
There you go.
They have ''Dancing with
the Stars'' in Poland too.
Come.
Come on, since you have to.
- My food will get cold.
- You talk too much.
Dear God!
Shit! Lord!
Jesus Christ!
- Now that's how it's done.
- Was there a fruit cocktail too?
What are you doing here?
Don't hurt me.
- Don't touch me!
- What are you afraid of?
You slut! Bitch!
Shut up!
What are you doing?
You don't beat kids.
And you don't punch women.
You're taking a taxi to the hospital, and you're
going to tell them that you fell down some stairs.
If I see you again, I'll
kill you. Do you understand?
Taxi!
I don't think he'll do that again.
Sounds too good to be true.
That's the way it is.
That asshole.
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.
Thanks anyway.
Hi. How are you? I
have something for you.
I've got diabetes.
Flowers make me itch. I'm allergic.
- Are you recovering well?
- It's 12 in the afternoon.
It's the day. Who's
working at the workshop?
- Merete.
- She can't repair cars.
It's pretty quiet at work now.
I'll go back right away. I'll hurry.
Was there something else?
I just didn't want you staring
at the celling all alone.
I was also thinking about my pay.
Things are a bit rough.
- I don't cheat people out of their pay checks.
- Of course you don't.
What are you doing?
There you go.
As thanks for all the food.
What are you, a playboy?
Being married with Sven
was hardy dancing on roses.
- Sven?
- He's allergic.
Flowers made him tickle all over.
No one said ''Thanks for
the food'' in our home.
Not much is needed
to make a woman happy.
But a pinch of attention,
showing some Love...
Kind words. Smiling. A man
should be able to give those.
Otherwise the woman will
become bitter and cold.
She gains weight. Becomes
obsessed with cleaning.
And the royal family. It's sick.
Tonight we'll do it nice and calm.
Women like that.
Tonight we'll do it nice and calm.
Come.
Calm.
Calm, Ulrik. Calm.
Ulrik!
Someone called. Geir.
- Here's the number.
- He's my son.
He's studying to be
an electrical engineer.
His bride's name is Silje. She's
pregnant. They have a nice apartment.
He's doing well.
She has beautiful hair.
You can ask me out.
- I won't force you to it.
- Wait.
Alright
- Not today, though.
- No.
I don't have any money today.
We could eat at my place
- We don't have to.
- I'd Love to come.
- I can make fishballs.
- Sounds good.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I don't know many people
who know about cars.
We're going to buy one.
You need a car with a baby.
- I forgot to wish you good Luck.
- Because of the car?
Let's hug.
Drive it in, and we'll see.
I found a photo of our fishing trip.
You did? Those were good times.
Weren't too many of them.
You were in prison so much.
I did a lot of time.
- I still go fishing.
- You do?
Our next fishing spot
is the Namsen-river.
- What do you think?
- Namsen is a good river for fishing.
I meant the car.
- What does he want for this?
- 28 000.
Haggle it down by 5 000
and it's a good deal
If Sven finds out about you borrowing
cars from the shop, he'll have a stroke.
We need to test run these
cars after they're fixed.
What do you eat in prison?
Whatever you can get.
- So you shot a man?
- Yes.
Picked up a gun and shot him.
- Where'd you get the gun?
- Back then I always had one.
Have you been to prison
for other things?
I've wanted to kill Kristian many times.
I used to dream about doing it.
But I never had the guts.
It's perfectly normal to be
afraid of killing someone.
But you weren't.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
It's been a Long time.
I hardly know you. I don't
know, how you kill people
How do you usually do it?
I shoot them.
I'm almost disappointed.
Haven't you ever used a knife?
- Those things are used to eat.
- What about a frozen, sharp bone?
- One shouldn't play with food.
- Wouldn't a car be good?
The spare parts. The jack.
Or if you just ran them over.
Or starter cables in water.
Car vax, vinyl paint...
Gas could work.
If you had the matches.
I should probably take my jacket off.
- Very good.
- It's the only dish I can do.
- I made the remoulade myself
- I can taste it.
- You can't stay the night.
- Alright
We aren't even married.
Hi.
Did you have a pleasant evening?
Food was ready at the
same time it always is.
- I won't interfere with your business.
- I was working over-time.
- At Sven's workshop?
- We're pretty busy right now.
- Because of the moisture.
- Moisture?
It's the weather. It's
a moist time of the year.
I actually bought you some chocolate.
Why do you smell like fishballs?
That's what the cleaning fluid
at the workshop smells like.
The stench is everywhere.
You must be starving
after your overtime.
Fish steaks.
Forget it.
Did the work take away your prowess?
Excuse me.
Entschuldigung.
I apologize for being so stupid.
You won't sleep with other women, right?
- Promise?
- I promise.
Want to go dancing tonight? It's
a Friday, so we could sleep in.
- Changing your clothes for food?
- No. I'm going out.
Sounds exciting.
Not like that.
I'm going to a convention.
- Convention?
- The mechanic convention.
We meet and discuss spare parts,
tools and overtime procedures.
- I suppose you don't want to eat.
- Of course I do.
I have some time before I go.
I hope you'll enjoy your convention.
Fruit cocktail
Do you feel it?
What?
When you wake up, -
and realise that your life isn't over.
Aren't you energetic!
- We must speak.
- Speak.
Karen Margarethe, you are...
A fantastic woman.
I am thankful for you
taking me to live with you.
And for the food.
- And for your companionship.
- And?
And for the TV.
I have met someone else.
Someone, who makes fishballs.
Is it Merete?
She's a tramp.
I don't think so.
No.
- But you think I am.
- What?
A bitch to use at your Leisure.
At my Leisure? No, Karen Margarethe!
- Even tramps have feelings.
- Of course they do!
Shit.
Hi, Geir. Does the car work?
- It's fantastic.
- I got you a little present.
Since you're getting a baby.
It's an exercise toy.
It's like a jungle. Everything is soft.
There are animals. A soft parrot.
A monkey and a tiger.
And there are some soft butterflies too.
Look at the tiger's tall.
There's a mirror in the giraffe.
- I don't know what that's for.
- I know those toys.
Listen...
When I met Silje, I told
her that my father had died.
I told her that that isn't true.
I told her that you're my father.
That's for the best.
I told her what you had done.
She wasn't pleased.
Her family doesn't like
that. They have an orchard.
Silje doesn't want the baby to have
a grandfather who shoots people
She has her principles.
It isn't normal to shoot a man,
even if he is screwing your wife.
A lot of people wouldn't
be so violent about it.
- Back then that's the way I was.
- Silje thinks you still are.
I don't think of you
as my father any more.
Take the present though. You
can say you bought it yourself.
Alright
- Bye then.
- Bye.
I thought that we had a deal
A deal about keeping the shop open.
Hello.
We also agreed that you
keep your hands off Merete.
I believe in giving everyone
their fair chance. I am no fool.
After all, we're all just people
But you screw up both the business
hours and the inter-work relationships, -
so I must express my disappointment.
I must say that your
future isn't with us.
You got a chance, but
you failed to grasp it.
I have a cabin.
I have a cabin. Are you listening?
- Ulrik is here.
- I can't see anyone.
I want to settle a score.
With Kenny. Not with you.
Rolf, hug.
Can we got coffee? And a tea?
Welcome home, Ulrik.
You Leave in five minutes, -
park in another street
and walk to the house.
Shoot as soon as he opens the door.
Don't give him a chance to escape.
Then you come back calmly
and change your clothes
Put the old clothes into the bag, and throw it
into the waste dump at the construction site.
The dump is emptied at five.
Throw the gun into the sea.
Then you pick me up from
Ulven, and we go to the pub.
Many people will see you there.
Maybe the cops will never
find you. If they do...
Show them this. You were in the
cinema when that bastard was killed.
Then you went to the pub, where
there were many witnesses.
You were at the movie with your
friend Jensen, who also has his ticket.
Rolf cried during the film
when the girl died of cancer.
There you go.
One thing is bothering me, Jensen.
Where's my ticket?
You don't get one,
because you're stupid.
If you were on the stand,
we'd all go to jail.
Go home, sleep, and
keep your mouth shut.
You did something stupid, Rolf.
Let's get this over with.
Put the dog into the bathroom.
Remember me?
- Do you?
- I got you to prison.
Count to twelve.
What?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...
10, 11, 12.
That's how Long I was in prison.
You shot my brother.
What would you have me do?
Everyone knew it was you guys.
Henriksen, Jensen and Rolf.
He was fucking my wife.
He was my big brother.
I couldn't Lay silent.
He was in on the car deals
as well. I kept my mouth shut.
I told him ''What are you
doing with Ulrik's wife?''
He called it Love Things like
that aren't open for discussion.
Bullshit!
If you would've just beat him up, shot
him in the knee or broken his arms.
You can break my arms.
Couldn't you do that?
Break my hands.
12 years.
Would you like me to make some tea?
Sounds good.
Don't smoke inside, please.
The kid is a bit asthmatic.
We hope it'll pass.
I'm happy to keep paying.
Or should I talk about that with Jensen?
Bye then.
Thanks.
- Who is it?
- Ulrik.
You can't come here.
- I just want to speak with Geir.
- No.
- Hello?
- Postman here.
I'm Leaving the moment
I've talked with Geir.
I want my children to grow up
with good and normal people
- I told you when I'd Leave.
- I'm calling the police.
I'll go. Don't get upset. I'll Leave.
Tell him that I won't come back.
He's fishing on the Namsen-river.
With a friend called Petteri.
Should I Leave him a note?
Tell him, that his father is dead.
My water broke.
Oh god, my water just broke!
I told him not to go so close to Labour.
I'll take you. I have a car.
- It hurts so much.
- No, no.
I told you! We're going
to the hospital now.
Who do you think? Your
fucking murderous father.
Burn in hell!
I'm giving fucking birth
and you can't make it!
- You asshoIe!
- Calm down.
The Namsen. That dick.
The baby is coming now!
Think about something
else. Sing something.
I don't know what to do. What do I do?
Calm down.
Fuck.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Did she give birth in your car?
- I'm borrowing it.
- Why were you there?
- I needed to see you.
About what?
Nothing.
I'm proud of you.
Hey.
Did you catch any fish?
Dad wasn't here, -
but grandfather was.
Ulrik.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Thanks to you.
Where were you? I'm freezing.
- It didn't go according to plan.
- But did you do it?
- No.
- No?
No. I didn't do it.
You ungrateful bastard.
I Looked after Wenche and Geir
for 12 years. Think about that.
Didn't Kenny pay them?
Kenny! Why else would he give you money?
He deserved it.
2 000 a month for putting
my best man in prison.
2 000? You only gave 1 500.
- How is that settling the score?
- Screw Kenny and you too.
- What's the blood from?
- A woman gave birth in the car.
What a mess. I've done
everything for you.
I got you the storage, the apartment, -
cigarettes and a job.
I even bought you a gun.
I Loaned you my car. You smoked
in it and made a mess of it.
You were just supposed
to shoot the informant.
You couldn't even do that.
No, you turn the car
to a fucking hospital.
What the hell have I done
to deserve you and Rolf, -
and Henriksen with his shitbags
and the drooling Gunnar?
And that old hag, Karen
Margarethe. I can't do this any-more.
- Jensen.
- What?
Be still
- You're back.
- My car is a mess.
Looks nice.
- Enhanced body.
- Mercedes S?
Used to be.
Alright
Alright
Thank you.
- I became a grandfather Last night.
- You did? Congratulations.
- It's coming.
- What?
Spring.
