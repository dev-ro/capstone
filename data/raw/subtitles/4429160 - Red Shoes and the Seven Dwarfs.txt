This is Fairytale Island.
A magical land of princes and princess,
and witches and monsters.
Here - accidents from strange events
happen all the time.
That's when people call us - The Fearless 7 -
the greatest heroes on Fairytale Island.
Especially ME - Merlin.
But everything changed the day we defeated
a dragon and saved a princess.
We thought we'd saved a witch -
so we attacked her.
But we were wrong. She wasn't a witch --
she was a princess.
The FAIRY princess!
How were we supposed to know?
She looked like a witch, and everyone knows
that a princess doesn't look like a witch.
Anyways, she wanted to teach us a lesson.
So, she put a curse on us.
And this was a nasty one,
that turned us into ugly little green monsters
whenever people looked at us.
And the only way to break the curse is to get
a kiss from the most beautiful woman in the world.
Are you kidding me?
With this face?
Hello, your majesty.
Good morning ma'am.
Good morning.
Magic tree, magic tree let this morning be the time
that you perform your duty...
...Of bringing me the shoes of youthful,
eternal beauty.
Yes.
WOW!
Change me... Finally.
Not again! How long must I wait?!
Oh No.
Clear these away!
Oh head down.
Oh, pull yourself together.
Here you are.
Oh! Thanks!
Huh? That wasn't here before.
What is she up to now?
Huh?
You weren't here before.
Whatever.
Owe!
Yes!
I can't believe my beloved daughter
Snow White has turned eighteen.
I only wish her mother could see the kind of smart
and beautiful young woman she's become.
Strange thing happened during the party.
The castle guards brought in a woman -
named Regina.
They said she was a witch.
But she was too beautiful to be a witch.
I have married Regina,
Everything feels so perfect!
...Except for Regina's strange looking mirror.
There's something not quite right.
People around the castle
have been disappearing one by one.
Is it because of that peculiar mirror?
I saw it with my own eyes!
Regina - talking to a tree!
She must be a witch!
I should send Snow away, to a safer place.
My dear Snow
by the time you read this,
my fate will be uncertain.
She's coming for me now.
I only hope you can find The Fearless Seven
and ask them for help!
Apples... the most suspicious of fruits.
Oh, papa, where are you.
But they don't look dangerous.
Regina?
No!! My shoes! Get her!
Owe!
Can I borrow this?
Okay.
Thanks!
What?
No!
Short, chubby and green.
Green is like an ogre.
Blue or yellow could have
made us look cute and cuddly.
Quit your complaining, Merlin.
I'm figuring out how to take this curse
and kick it where the sun don't shine.
Listen, we need to find the most
beautifulest princess to kiss us,
and we've just about run out of options!
How would a beautiful woman even see you,
Mr. Invisible?
What was that? Some kind of bird?
Magic Mirror full of wisdom,
who's the fairest in the kingdom??
The woman who wears the red shoes.
And side-note: "wisdom" and "kingdom"
don't really rhyme.
Cut the sass and tell me her name!
Ha!
How should I know? I don't get out much.
Well, you are the magic mirror.
"Magic" is just my first name.
It's short for "Magitchard," like Richard.
What can you do then?
I just reflect what I see.
The truth. And the truth is,
that you should see yourself right now.
Watch it.
Distribute wanted posters to every town, village,
valley, forest and forge in the kingdom and find her!
I feel my power draining. I don't have much time.
The aging is accelerating.
And only three bumbling bits of kindling for help.
Perhaps you should recruit another.
Someone who stands to gain from your success.
How about this fellow?
Interesting. Tell me more, Magitchard.
Hey, hey, over here, over here!
Si', si' come, very quick!
Look at us! Look, look, look!
What is it?
I know a lot about silhouettes.
And I think this shape... is a witch.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Yes, it could be a witch, or -- yah, it's a witch.
The witch who cursed us!
Let's catch her and make her break the spell!
En garde!
Wands where I can see 'em, witch!
Fraulein!
NO, NO, NO, Stop!
I baked you some revenge!
beautiful.
I didn't know anyone could be so beautiful.
How did she end up with us?
Hello, dear lady.
Welcome to my home-slash-command post.
I have six roommates, but my name's on the lease.
I pay the rent.
YOUR home? Oh my gosh, I am, I am so sorry. I was,
I was starving and I wandered into this home --
There's no need to apologize.
We didn't mean to interrupt your stolen meal.
If you're still hungry,
I can whip up something simple --
You see,
I marinate the celery root in a mustard aioli--
Who is that?
Ahh-who?
Wow! I look so...different.
I mean my face, and my waist. My waist? My waist.
Oh my gosh! What happened to me?
Well...
Ha! Must have gotten up so quickly.
My back is killing me!
You mean your head, right? Do you need help?
No. I'm fine.
Um, is that really what I look like?
In the mirror. Do you see the same thing?
You're beautiful, miss.
Like an angel?
Wow, really?
Could it be...?
Excuse me, but who are you?
Oh, I'm Sno--
"Snot"?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
My name is... Red Shoes.
Yep, it's me, Red Shoes!
Cool name.
By any chance would that be "Princess" Red Shoes?
Of course she's a princess!
How could she be so beautiful if she weren't?
Obviously! Right, miss?
Obviously...I mean, I am a princess...
Who are you guys?
I'm Merlin, part time hero, full time romantic.
And this is Jack, Hans,
Arthur, Pino, Noki, and Kio.
No way! Your names are the same as F7!
The Fearless Seven. I'm looking for them!
Let me guess, Merlin's your favorite.
No, not really.
Nah, that Merlin's not your type.
You seem like a Prince Arthur fan to me.
Honestly, none of them are really my type.
Oh. Well, that's fine because we're not them,
we're actually completely different people.
In no way are we the same guys put under a curse
and changed into different forms,
but only if someone looks at us,
it's very complicated..
Glad we're all clear.
So how can I assist you, my fair lady?
I need to find my father.
And I know that the F7 can help...
We know the F7 very well,
and their schedule is fully booked.
Leave it to me!
I'll find your father within the month.
I can do it in one week.
Four days.
Three!
Two!
One!
--and a half.
I already found your father like two weeks ago.
Really?
I just need a few days
to get him across state lines.
I seriously need to find my dad.
Hold on.
Nobody has seen the F7 in over a year, right?
You're not going to find them now.
We're your best bet.
Wow. No one's offered to help me
for such a long time.
You guys are awesome.
Really? You think... we're awesome?
Yeah, you guys are caring, and sweet, and...
...And not completely hideous to look at?
No. You guys are totally adorable.
I think I hit her too hard.
But she is a beautiful
She can help me break the curse.
Who is coming to my birthday party?
Has Ariel rsvp'ed?
She says she can't make it, sir.
She has to wax her legs.
But she's a mermaid!
What about Sleeping Beauty?
Doctor's appointment.
Is she sick?
Says she has insomnia.
If she's not going to sleep,
she can come to our party.
What about Rapunzel?
And don't tell me she's getting her hair done.
No, she's writing something called... a book.
Princess Cruise?
That's a ship, sir.
Princess Leia?
She's a general now.
I demand glorious guests!
I couldn't be any more unpopular.
And I don't understand why.
Greetings, Prince Average.
It's pronounced "AVE-VOO-RAHJ."
Sure it is.
If you're here
for the We Love Our Peasants Gruel Giveaway,
that promotion has ended.
Grab your wrinkles and go.
Move along.
Do you think the people would respect you
if you celebrated your birthday
with a beautiful woman on your arm.
Finally, someone talking sense!
This horrible crone gets it.
Then may I suggest inviting...
...this young lady.
She's beautiful! When can she get here?
Well that's up to you.
You see, she's stolen something from me.
You find her, bring her along with you
and you won't look like such a loser,
and I get my shoes back.
Fear not, loyal hag.
I, Prince Ave- voo-rahj, shall find this fugitive
and make her pay for her crimes.
By making her attend my birthday party!
There shall be balloons!
I just thought of that!
Let's have a lot of balloons!
More like buffoons.
It looks just like papa.
Papa won't recognize me.
Huh? Why won't these shoes just, just come off?
Oh, yes. This is me.
Would you like to join me in a moisturizing mask?
Oh, thanks. Oh, oof, but I am so tired.
Are you sure?
It's very important to take care of your skin.
Positive.
but this is the finest French recipe meant
to hydrate skin.
It is made of French poopie!
Papa?!
A spell that makes you fall in love...
Ah. There it is.
Merlin, have you seen my cookbook?
Have you checked in the kitchen?
Ah, silly me. The kitchen. Of course.
Now. Where was I?
Merlin. Have you seen my moisturizer?
It's nowhere to be found...
No. Whatever it is. I haven't seen it.
Now please - go away.
Someone's got anger management issues.
Getting a kiss was never a problem with this face.
Red Shoes?
Papa? Papa, are you there? Papa!
Boys, I'm telling you,
sweet treats are the way to a woman's heart.
It works. I call it an auto- portrait!
I call it, the dupli-cata-tron!
I call it, selfie!
Red Shoes must love it!
Monsieur, Monsieur.
She doesn't want sweets and selfies.
Women want...
...diamonds.
Merlin?
"The Book of Spells to Make You Fall in Love?"
Huh?
Okay, big, terrifying wooden bunny.
You're a nice bunny.
You're a vegan bunny, right?
What... was that?... Lightning?
Actually, it's called magic.
I do it.
Really?... Then... do some!
Keep running! And whatever you do,
don't look back!
But I can't leave without you -
You're looking back! Don't do that!
But...
Hate to zap you, long ears.
But I gotta impress a beautiful woman.
Big, scary bunny! Over here!
Red, stop putting yourself in--!
Danger...
Arthur! I got you!
It's no use, Red Shoes.
I'm slipping away. Not much time.
Just... need to... use that core of mine...
I see that light at the end of the funnel.
Time for me to kick butt in heaven.
I had a good run. Hashtag blessed.
Oh I used to be able to bench 250...
Before I go, how about a farewell kiss?
Red Shoes! Oh, thank goodness you're safe.
Do you need CPR?
I'm basically an expert.
And don't worry, I brushed my teeth. Twice.
No, no-no-no, I'm fine, but Arthur - he's stuck.
He tried to save me,
and then he got stuck underneath...
Would you get up.
What? He's not hurt?
Only his pride.
Seriously, Arthur.
You need to find a better way to hit on girls.
Stand back. I may have to risk my life again.
Someone call for three inventors?
For three geniuses?
Ooh! That sounds like us!
Everyone came running to help.
Great...just great.
Everyone except Merlin that is.
Ah. Super. There he is now.
Where have you been?
Something awful could have happened
to Red if I hadn't shown up.
You?! Don't even... go there... I saved... her first.
Right?
I was worried about you.
I was worried about me too. But mostly you.
No one needs to worry.
Arthur's here. Please, my lady.
Um... OK
You shouldn't go into the forest by yourself.
It's a nightmarish landscape fit only
for bloodthirsty warriors like myself.
And squirrels.
I thought I saw my father.
Turned out just to be that big bunny.
Well, if you ever make such a dangerous
and weird mistake again,
just know that I can protect you.
That's very kind.
And if you really want
to express your gratitude, you can...
Oh, I am so sorry!
That was much... slapper than I intended it to be.
Oh, it happens. No problem.
Maybe an apology kiss then?
Bravo, mon ami!
Nice try.
Red Shoes!
Gentlemen, to break this curse we're going
to have to work as a tightly-knit team.
Which means you do everything I say.
Excuse me?
Huh?
What? No.
You got to be kidding
Hans and Jack will search around the dismal lake.
Triplets, you search the caves of despair.
Red Shoes and I will go to Golden Goose Avenue.
Golden Goose Avenue.
Which happens to be your go-to place for dates.
We are going to focus on the mission.
And then see where the evening takes us.
The only thing you're going to shop
for on Golden Goose Avenue is rejection.
And you can't even afford that.
I like my odds. You saw what she did.
An expression of affection.
Every woman shows it differently.
You took your shot, you got slapped.
May I remind you that this is the closest thing
to a kiss anyone's had since the curse.
Let's work together
to guide Red Shoes' feelings towards me,
so We can break the curse.
What about the rest of us?
After I resume my princely form,
the word about F7 will be out.
Ladies will be begging to kiss your green mugs.
Really?
Sounds reasonable.
I'll bring the gelato!
Getting one kiss sure is easier than getting seven.
This is not a plan! He's just out for himself.
A half-baked plan is better than none.
Don't worry, Merlin.
I have a big assignment for you.
Hmph. Big Assignment?
Here you go. I drew this up last night.
I can't tell if this drawing is terrible
or really avant-garde.
Awe, my neighbor's a great art teacher,
Pablo Picass-ogre.
One thing's for sure, Daddy's on the big side
...of big.
You must take after your mother.
No, I look a lot like pap--
Oh, yeah, my mother. Gosh, we, exactly. Twins.
Alright, you know the plan.
Let's move! Deploy!
Thunder dwarfs are go!
And where do you think you're going?
Your post is right there.
You watch the savage monster.
I call him vicious.
I call him "Woodbottom."
Don't worry, Merlin,
we'll make sure you get kissed, too.
Eventually.
we will split up here.
Alright. See you later.
I know exactly where we should look
to find your father!
Really? Where?
Daddy!
Wow!
Is this what I think it is?
I present Excalibur, a legendary sword trapped
in this rock for centuries,
waiting for a man of great strength to release it.
It says: "Do not attempt to remove by force."
Oh, right. I guess, uh,
the truth is, I realized you are the woman
of my destiny the first time I saw you.
I thought if I could show you my strength...
...I would be worthy of your affections.
Oh! Oops! I'll put it back.
No! No, no, no. Can I hold it?
Oh, Arthur, it's just beginners luck.
You want me to maybe pull it out for you again?
No. I'm not humiliated at all.
Let's go.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm the real prisoner here.
What? You're hungry?
and fetch
Hop along, big guy.
There's no way Arthur is breaking this curse alone.
Excuse me!
Arthur, where are you going?
Oh. Okay.
See you later.
Hi.
Oh, look at what you made me do!
You...
I'm sorry.
made me make it perfect. Thank you.
I'm so sorry.
No. Don't be. I'm sorry. Are you all right? And...
don't worry about this.
What?
Ta-da!
Excuse me, have you seen this man?
Arthur. I was thinking.
What if I just like pull out the Excalibur for you?
our secret.
Really? We have a secret now?
Yeah.
I like a girl who can keep things classified.
Let's find your pops, Red!
Bye Guys
What?
Hey, you. ...No.
Hey!
stop!
C'mon!
Oh, you guys don't have to help.
That's not her. C'mon.
Sorry, miss.
Red Shoes! Red Shoes! Where has she gone.
Where's Red Shoes?
That's what I'd like to know!
Wait a minute,
who said you could leave your post?
I'm just walking the bunny.
Red Shoes, where are you?
Hey, you've seen this girl?
Look what I found.
Oh, those are mine. Um,
can I actually have my shoes back?
No way! You're not serious, are you?
I'm really not in the mood.
Could you just please give'em back to me?
Ha! They won't even fit on you!
They're gonna fit me better than they fit you.
Hey!
Red Shoes?
Guys, guys, I'm here!
Red Shoes!
Red Shoes, where are you?
Even the hideous dwarfs won't help you.
Those dwarfs are not hideous,
and I don't need anyone to help me.
Ahh-Owe!
Freeze! Put the shoes down, get on your knees,
and put your hands behind your head.
On second thought - they're yours.
There's no need to push me into a corner.
This is super scary.
Your red shoes, m'lady.
Thank you.
Excuse me miss, have we met?
Umm... well...
that's kind of a complicated question.
Red Shoes?
Gotta go. Be safe.
Umm...
Guys!
Where has she gone?
Red Shoes!
Stop!
Hold on!
Huh, wait a minute.
Gotcha now, don't we?
Ha-ha... I don't get it.
Now we know how fast bunny can hop in a pinch.
Thank you for helping me, Merlin.
Pleasure my lady. But I also did it for us.
By the way, what is this?
Gush it sounds silly,
but it's my shoes. they're magical.
I know they're fabulous,
but why they are after you?
No my shoes, they are... actually made of magic.
Red shoes!
Are you a criminal?
No, of course not.
I know girl this pretty
couldn't possibly be a criminal
Look we should head out now.
There could be more guards around any minute.
Don't worry about them. I've got these bad boys.
This is going to make so much harder
to find my dad.
I have an idea!
What do you think?
That is amazing. Thank you.
You had a thing on your cheek
Alright, let's go.
We've been walking for hours.
And we'll keep walking till we find her.
Now we've got her
Are they gone?
Who cares.
Com'n let's go see.
look at that!
Wow!
awesome
Who's that?
It's the girl's father.
But where is the girl?
It saids to go to risky rock,
so she must be there.
But why risky rock?
We should ask the girl.
Perfect! Where is the girl?
It saids to go to risky rock,
so she must be there.
But why risky rock?
We should ask the girl.
Um... where is the girl?
It saids to go to risky rock,
so she must be there.
But why risky rock?
We should ask the girl.
Owe! What was that for?
You, sir, are sabotaging my relationship
with Red Shoes.
What "relationship" are you talking about?
Red Shoes and I share a secret.
I would tell you what it is.
But it's a secret.
Well, while you're busy keeping secrets,
I'm going to break my curse.
You're nothing without your spells, magic boy.
And you're nothing without Excalibur.
You're not waiting for someone
to pull it out for you, are you?
How did you know??
Is it true?
Hans, you shouldn't have!
Something sweet for someone sweeter.
This is, this is spectacular!
Awe, it's nothing.
Just let me know what you want,
anytime, for the rest of your life.
Do you like fondue?
Behold, carved by the finest jewelers out
of all the jewelers I know.
Which is a lot.
It's pretty.
And it's yours, Miss Shoes.
Yours, in exchange for nothing.
Maybe a kiss.
That's really sweet, Jack, but I can't accept it.
I don't want your jewels,
only your good intentions.
My intentions are more than good.
They're super-bon.
Testing, one two.
Testing. No I'm pushing that, you dolt.
Attention, hideous dwarfs!
Is it dwarfs, with a "F", or dwarves, with a "V"?
I want to use whatever's more offensive.
Oh, it's that loser, Prince Average.
Heard that! It's "Ave-voo-RAHJ."
Oh, please.
Inside your amateurish attempt
at a facade of a sham of a travesty
of a veneer of a castle
is a gorgeous wanted criminal.
I hereby command that all of you exit the premises
and surrender post haste!
Fail to comply,
and you will never see these two again.
You have until three...
One...!
Two...!
I lied! Charge!
Am I the person you want?
Yes. Yes, you are.
Though I don't know if you're a person
or a vision of beauty,
some kind of angelic... thing with wings...
angelic wing thing.
I will come with you.
But only after you release my friends.
Do it. Do it!
Now. Here's the good news.
It's my birthday --
and you are going to be the belle of the ball.
The invitation sounds great, really. But...
It wasn't an invitation, more of an order.
Prepare the lady's carriage.
She said she doesn't wanna go, Average.
Ave-voo-rahj. Don't troll me, troll.
So rude!
I couldn't agree more!
Subjects these days. Now, shall we?
Get her!
You hold off the guards,
and I'll get her out of here.
No, I'm faster! You stay here and buy us time.
Here's a thought. Stop fighting...and fight!
What's the plan?
Let's rescue Red Shoes.
Like the old days, guys.
Arthur!
Can we get this over with, they're just dwarfs.
Hey. Did you guys hear something?
Come on!
Uh oh.
Hi guards, are we taking a break?
Well FYI -
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!
Who's throwing vegetables? Huh?
Yeah! You just got Merlin'd!
Run!
Jack!
Duck!
I'm so sorry, are you alright?
No, I'm not.
Gentlemen, he surrenders.
What?
Engines, full power!
Shields up!
Turn on the mini-fridge!
Superhero landing!
Hooray for us!
We did it! It was mostly me.
What?
You got to be kidding.
Finally, the big guns. Thank you!
FIRE!
FIRE!
Ooh, close.
The cannonball, not you.
OK Time out, time out! Everyone time out!
You almost blew her up.
And she can't come to my party if you blow her up!
Sorry sir...
All right, time back in.
Surrender, monsters!
No - Wait!
Huh, that's pretty cool.
Everyone inside! And hurry!
WHAAAA!
You messed with the wrong prince!
There's nothing Average about Ave- voo-RAHJ!
I shall return!
On Tuesday.
No, wait, let me check my calendar... Thursday.
I shall return Thursday!
We'll be ready!
And waiting!
Arrivederci!
Chow for now!
Bye, bye!
You just got dwarfed! Is that better?
I think Merlin'd is better.
You should have seen the look on his big,
ugly face when Bunny came running at him.
That's how you see everything, isn't it?
With my eyes?
You always talk about what someone looks like.
I do?
I wouldn't say that.
But I can't wait for you to see the real me.
What kind of Merlin is the real you?
You might not believe it,
but the real me is famous, handsome
and even popular.
Not short, stumpy and green.
Yeah, you're short, stumpy and green.
But you're also a wonderful and charming person.
I'm not explaining it right. If you saw the real me,
you'd know exactly what I mean.
I think I can see the real you.
And I like you, just as you are.
That's hilarious.
Here - close your eyes, and imagine the real me.
I guarantee you it'll be different.
I do feel something different.
-- Really?
But eyes opened or closed,
to me you're still Merlin.
Now tell me, who am I to you?
You're a gift.
A gift that'll transform me into someone amazing.
Just like you're amazing.
Actually, I want to show you something, too.
Do you need a hand?
Hold on! Nope. Stand back. I got this.
One, two...Okay, yeah. I need help.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Nope.
Thank you though.
You know the weird thing is,
they're super comfortable.
No, I'm just saying, where were you
when the facade was falling?
I mean that was terrifying.
What are you doing here?
I've come for my shoes.
Well, I had them. I mean, I saw them.
But those, those dwarfs.
It's dwarves. With a "v." So you failed?
I did not fail.
I took a time-out.
Yeah, this is a calculated time- out,
I'm going to return on Thursday,
we all penciled it in.
Silence!
Have a bite.
For strength.
Apples. The most suspicious of fruits.
I don't have much time, Prince.
You could still have the best birthday ever.
But remember what's bad for me,
will be very bad for you.
She is gone...
Ah, what's the worst that could happen?
It's kinda sweet...
Don't move.
Okay.
Pino, Noki, Kio - show us what you got!
Okey-dokey!
Here we go!
Our pleasure!
Keep going, little to the left. right there.
Now that looks like a real home.
Yeah. I could get used to that.
Nu-uh. I cannot.
It's a perfect copy of my drawing! That's incredible!
Let me try.
Wow. This will definitely make it easier
to find your dad.
Unfortunately, this thing ain't flying.
It's grounded.
Why does it need to fly?
The posters are no good
if we can't distribute them fast.
Guys, thank you so much
for everything you're doing for me.
Hi~
Wow! look at that!
Wow.
opening doors!
You know, merlin?
I feel so lucky that I've meet you.
I feel the same way!
I feel like anything is possible!
Merlin! watch out!
Merlin.
Merlin.
Merlin!
everything OK?
Of course, sure!
Nothing to be embarrassed about.
So why are we even talking about
that when we should be going...
this direction.
Hey, wait!
So, about these magic shoes.
Are those still bothering you?
What kind of magic do those shoes have?
Well...How do I put this?
Merlin, I used to be strong. Really strong.
And, I was always proud of that.
But the shoes' magic, um,
it made me a little dainty.
Sorry to hear.
The shoes made me lose a little bit of weight.
Could be worse.
Ok, a lot of weight.
Ah.
Well, I know what it's like to look different
on the outside from what you feel on the inside.
Merlin, I'd like to do give you a token
of my appreciation.
Oh, here. Hand me one of your spells.
Why?
Oh come on, I'm not going to zap you.
Give me a sec.
There. Consider it your good luck charm.
Thank you.
Merlin, do you think we'd be happier
if we were our old selves again?
Yep. Yep, yep, definitely we would.
I don't know. I like how we are.
Right here, just, right now.
Even if I'm an ugly green monster?
I don't care about your height
or what color you are
that's the way you feel about me, right?
Yes, of course! I mean, duh.
I think we're both just trapped
under the same spell.
Wait. Keep your eyes closed.
Don't open them until I say.
When you open your eyes,
there will be a handsome man in front of you.
Someone worthy of you.
Someone you'd be proud to be seen with.
I think you're right.
Ready, and...
It's such a good day to break a curse.
Now!
Tada! You just got Merlin'd! Ha-ha!
What do you think?
Mission impossibly handsome, right?
It's okay. I know this is a lot to take in.
But you can let your happiness flag fly.
This. This. Is the real me.
Ha Ha it's stupid.
What? Wait a minute.
My hands are still green sausages.
No. I look the same.
Yes. Impossibly handsome.
This doesn't make sense.
You're the most beautiful woman in the world!
Why do I look the same?
What are you talking about, Merlin?
Do I need a longer kiss?
Two kisses?
Let's try again.
Um, you're not making any sense.
Hurry!
What is that?!
This kingdom has a serious monster problem!
You all right?
No, I'm not.
Thank you.
Pleasure my lady.
Whoa!
Watch out!
Ha ha. Yes!
What?
What do they want?! Besides smashing us?
I don't know!
The old me would have nailed that!
You just got Merlin'd!
Hurry!
Red, close your eyes.
Um, this is no time for kissing, Merlin!
Just trust me. Close your eyes.
Please! Close them!
That was too close.
Don't look at me.
You see that tree on the other side of the bridge?
Yeah.
On my signal, run towards it as fast as you can.
No, I can't leave you here!
You have to. And don't look back, okay?
Look right at that tree until I say it's safe.
Promise you won't look.
Um, okay. I promise.
Now!
What's that?
You just got Merlin'd! Yes you did.
Hey, block-head!
Hey block-head bear!
You're even more
of a block-head than Prince Average!
Ave-voo-rahj!
Prince Average?
You just got Merlin'd.
Take a look, Red Shoes.
Merlin!
I have triumphantly saved the day!
Merlin! No!
No!
Merlin!
Snow White?
Snow White?
The thief was Snow White this whole time?!
Interesting. She could remove the shoes.
You're going after her yourself?
What? Were you going to go?
I get it. I don't have legs.
So. Here I am. Well, the real me.
I bet you're disappointed, huh?
You're the girl from Golden Goose Avenue.
Red Shoes!
That's not my name. It's Snow White.
Princess Snow White? So your father is --
King White, yeah.
By the time I figured out his new wife Regina
was a witch, he'd already disappeared.
And the monsters who attacked us were sent
by my stepmother to get these shoes.
I guess being beautiful is really worth
that much to her...
Have you thought about just giving them back?
And give up their magic?
If I'd given up their magic you wouldn't have
helped me find my father, would you?
Would you?
I thought we were both under the same spell,
but I see now that, I was wrong.
Listen, I can't get into all the details,
but I'm under a curse too.
You still don't get it, Merlin.
I'm not talking about our curses,
Merlin, I'm talking about the kind
of spell you never want to break.
He likes you more than he likes me.
What would have happened if she had
taken off her shoes that day in the barn?
You think that's important?
I just wonder what I would have done
if I had seen the real Snow White.
Seriously?
It's still all about appearance for you.
No! Not exactly.
But I can't live looking like you
for the rest of my life!
Kind of proving my point, other me.
Alright, let's try this--
who do you like more, Snow White or Red Shoes?
Easy! It's Red Shoes.
Now, which of us do you think
Red Shoes likes more?
Easy! It's-- me,
wait, no, it's you?
You're a gift. A gift that'll transform me
into someone amazing.
Well, I know what it's like to look different
on the outside from what you feel on the inside.
look at that!
The shoes. You're wearing them?
I thought you left.
You should take them off again.
I can't.
Ugh, you just had to make things complicated.
Maybe this will help.
Eat the apple, and they'll slide right off.
Where did you get that?
I want to help you, Snow White. Please.
Red Shoes?
Merlin?
Merlin??
What terrible timing you have.
Uggh, we're going to have to do this the hard way.
Regina?
Aw. Such a tender family reunion.
So sad we can't stay.
Red Shoes!
C'mon. Let's go, long ears!
Hey! Wait for us!
How about you go back and get the others.
And make lots of copies of this.
Let's go!
We can do this!
Your power, my lady, it has drained you.
You think? I don't need you tell me how I look.
I'm a mirror. It's what I do?
M-I-R- O-R. I can't spell.
Enough!
Bind her. It's snack time.
How can you sleep-eat at a time like this?
I'm not supposed to talk when I have this on,
but I gotta ask - do you think they've kissed yet?
I hope so. Because it'll feel better
to punch Merlin when he's pretty.
We've been waiting forever! Where have you --
Did you break the curse, yet?
Ah, Merlin - are you hungry?
Those are bears.
Uh, hi. This is from Merlin.
Wow. This is so cool.
Okay, sword.
If you think you've humiliated,
embarrassed and otherwise frustrated me...
You're right.
But that ends now!
Oh, please end this.
Hey! Wait! you are running the wrong way!
The castle is over there!
Uh, "sit."
Eat this, darling, and you'll get your freedom.
Where's my father?
Uggh. Royal, loyal little girl,
pining for her papa.
This is getting a little boring.
So I need you to take a bite, and I'll tell you.
I won't let you win. You've torn apart my family,
and you will not get away with it, Regina.
Ooh, so scared, Snow.
Very well. A different approach, then.
Merlin!
Eat the apple or watch him die.
That's your choice.
Red Shoes! Don't do it!
Promise to me you'll let him go.
Oh absolutely. When the third bell chimes,
everything will be just like it used to be.
Red Shoes, don't do it! No!
Save my papa for me.
The Legendary handsome Merlin,
fearless rescuer of princesses...
...sitting in a tree. Not getting K-I-S-I-N-G'd!
Burn! I can't spell.
You don't have to do this.
Just take the shoes and let us go!
Ugh, I wish! They're made of pure magic apple --
the fruit of temptation and want.
They feed on your desires.
And once they give you what you desire,
the bond is permanent.
That's not true. She took them off in the river.
That doesn't make any sense.
How could she possibly want to save you
more than she wanted to be beautiful?
What did you do to her?
Did you cast a spell?
What's going to happen to her?
Well, once she eats the apple,
its magic will turn her into a magic apple tree.
Gong! First bell sounds. Very dramatic.
The tree bears fruit at the second bell.
Gong! Excitement mounts!
The morning sun touches the fruit,
turning it into a new pair of red shoes.
Gong number three! The circle of life!
And then what?
Regina will be the most beautiful person
in the kingdom. Forever.
I don't care about her! What about Snow White?
The tree withers and dies. And so does Snow White.
No!
Yas! Oh! I'm rotting! I'm dying.
Why don't you come back and play.
Not so fast.
It's gonna hurt.
Oh yeah! Stretch it out.
Uh oh.
Smoke! Smoke!
We're here, mate. Are you OK?
Yeah
I never thought I'd say this,
but I'm so glad to be chubby and green again.
Seven to one, I like those odds. Let's go.
We like those odds even better.
Are you up to this, muchacho?
Wow. You finally pulled out Excalibur!
Uh huh. Yeah, yeah, I did it,
that's exactly how it went down.
Here you go, Merlin, you're gonna need these.
Thanks.
Here comes the sun.
Now let's all get dwarfed!
This is where your fairy tale ends, trolls!
You missed.
Au revoir, mirror!
Finally..!
It's a good day to break a curse!
...Eternal beauty!
I'm sorry, Snow White.
Noo!
Extraordinary no more carrots for me.
Woah!
We're back!
Yippee!
Papa!
Snow White!
Oh, Papa!
Snow!
Wait.
Where's Merlin?
I'm so sorry.
He sacrificed himself to stop Regina.
Merlin, no!
Merlin!
I thought you were gone.
You're the most beautiful woman in the world.
Whether my eyes are open or closed.
No...
I got Merlin'd.
You're Prince Merlin.
Yeah. That Merlin.
The one who's not really your type.
I kinda liked the short and green Merlin.
But I'm still that Merlin inside.
Yes. Yes you are.
Yay!
Yes!
Hooray!
Nice!
Any idea who that girl is?
Not again.
