It was
in all the papers at the time.
Men searching in the Arctic
had found a yellow metal.
Gold.
A mad fever spread
as far as word can travel
and thousands more rushed to
the North to try their luck.
These men needed dogs.
Big dogs with strong muscles
to pull their sleds.
Good morning there, Buck!
Buck
was neither house dog
nor kennel dog.
Here you go, boy.
His master
was Santa Clara County judge.
Hey!
Whoa! Watch it, you!
In this
realm, Buck was king.
Damn it, creature!
Careful!
That's Judge Miller's dog.
You wish the judge
a happy birthday from me.
Thanks, will do.
Come on, Buck! Let's go.
News of the Klondike!
Thousands of gold rushers
converge in Dawson City!
News of the Klondike! Oh.
Here you go, lad.
Buck, stop!
Buck!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Buck!
- Get! Stop it.
- Come here!
Lady,
call your dog! Look out!
Buck! Come here!
Out of the way!
Come back here
right now! Buck! Stop!
Buck.
No!
I'm so, so sorry!
I'm sorry.
That dog's a menace.
Oh, he's just spoiled.
Buck means well.
Usually.
Abigail, cook needs you.
Buck.
Go wake the girls.
Oh.
Grab the roast!
Uh... I'll look out!
Out!
No.
Remember we talked
about this, Buck.
Today you need to be
on your best behavior.
Buck?
Hmm.
Your Honor.
Smells very, very good.
Happy birthday.
Everyone over here first.
All right, Molly.
You look beautiful.
All right. Settle.
Buck.
Why don't you
sit out here
and you think
on what you've done.
No. Not now, Buck.
This wasn't the first night
Buck spent on the porch.
Come on, Buck.
Come on.
He was less attentive
to his master's commands...
Hey, Buck.
I got a treat for ya.
...than he was
to his own instincts.
Come on.
Get the treat. Come on!
Good boy.
Good boy.
Get the treat.
Get the treat.
Good boy. Good boy!
He answers
to the name of Buck.
He'll fetch a fine price
where he's going.
Hold up!
I'll need extra hands
for this last transfer.
What in the world
is in this thing?
Dog.
How many?
Just one.
Locked in that box...
...he couldn't eat,
drink, or sleep.
Buck had no idea
where he was,
where he had been,
where he was going.
Easy, boy.
All you have to do
is sit.
This ain't
the Southland anymore.
Go on.
See it.
See it, boy.
It's the law of the land now.
The law of club
and fang.
No one above it.
Now what's it
gonna be, doggy?
Good.
Good.
You a fast learner.
Buck stood no chance
against a man with a club.
He knew that.
He was beaten.
But he was not broken.
Hey!
Come on!
Skagway, Alaska.
Gateway to the Yukon.
The edge of nowhere.
Most anyone looking for gold
went through here first.
All right,
let's go, let's go.
There you go.
Get your caribou stew!
Right there.
Buck was
a long way from home.
Do you betray our Lord
for your lust of gold?
Don't mind them.
Come on.
No. This way. This way.
Come on! Move.
There you go. Come on.
Come on.
Come on now, buddy.
It's just snow, Buck.
Come on.
Hey! Buck, come on!
Get over here!
Buck!
All right.
That's it.
The house is hers?
Yes, sir. The house
and everything in it.
That's good.
She deserves it.
All aboard!
Not much luck up there
this last year.
Seems more folks coming back
pockets empty
than full of gold.
I'm not looking for gold.
Hey! Jeez...
Watch yourself.
Last boat
to Dawson leaving now!
Miss it,
it's only sleds till spring.
That's mine.
Hey! Thanks.
Buck!
Got ya.
Buck's his name?
Come on, let's go.
Thanks, Buck.
You're a fast one.
All right. This way.
Good morning.
Perrault!
Been a long time.
Good to see you.
How've you been?
Good, good.
So, telegraph
hasn't put the mail service
out of business yet?
Not yet.
I need two dogs
for my team.
You wanna go?
Don't wait for me!
Bonjour, Francoise!
What have you done now?
This is Buck.
Two. We needed two.
What? He's big.
Too big.
- He'll never make it.
- He'll make it.
What do you know? Aah.
Okay, let's you
meet the team.
Buck, meet Spitz.
Your new boss.
Stay out of his way.
That's Dolly.
Pike.
Jo.
Billie.
Dub.
Dave.
And Sol-leks.
You are here.
Welcome to the team.
We have a new route,
so everyone pay attention.
You, too, Dave.
We are here.
We deliver mail 500 miles
all the way to here.
Dawson.
They don't understand you.
Buck, just do
what Spitz does. Okay?
He leads, you follow.
Team, ready?
Remember, we don't
just carry the mail,
we carry lives!
And, mush!
Come on, mush!
Allez!
Allez!
Spitz! Gee!
Whoa! Whoa!
See, Buck?
Now all our fates are one.
They're dogs!
They don't understand.
Oh, yes, he does.
Oh, yes.
Buck, we're all
tied up together now.
We fall all together,
but so do we get up as one.
Come. We try again.
Easy.
That's it, Spitz.
I think
your dog is broken.
He's not broken.
He's just got
Californian feet.
Out here,
under an open sky...
Buck felt a cold
he'd never known.
Out!
Dogs sleep outside!
Growing up
in the world of man...
Buck had learned
to listen to their voices.
Tonight,
he would begin
to hear his own.
Come on, Buck!
We have to get on the day.
Allez!
On by!
Mail!
Thanks, Perrault.
- Mail!
- Thank you!
That's better!
You are a heavy one.
Spitz! Gee!
Yeah! That's a turn!
You see?
He learns quick.
Doing
the work of a sled dog
brought Buck confidence
and joy.
Now, he belonged to a pack.
Gee!
Yeah, that's it!
Fantastique!
You're a real sled dog
now, Buck!
Hold up.
Buck, stay.
No, no, no! Francoise!
Francoise!
Francoise!
Francoise!
You okay?
Buck!
Buck!
Save him!
Buck!
Buck!
Buck!
Buck!
Buck!
Buck!
Buck!
Buck.
Buck.
Buck.
Oh, Buck.
Oh, Buck.
Crying for a dog.
No.
No, no.
I wasn't crying.
You were crying.
No.
I wasn't.
In all his years
hauling the mail...
Perrault has never
been on time.
Not once.
But he drives every day
like it might happen.
He believes.
But I never saw him
believe in anything
as much as
he believes in you.
Now I do, too.
A pack
can have only one leader.
Spitz had had enough.
Spitz!
Spitz!
Spitz! Spitz!
It's not like him.
I looked all morning.
I can't find him anywhere.
It's like he's vanished.
Spitz!
We have to go.
Without him.
Can't lose the day.
Sol-leks! Oh.
Buck? Back in place.
Allez!
Sol-leks has got
more than five years on you.
Get in line.
Ooh.
Buck.
Just because you pull good
don't make you ready to lead.
Okay? Allez.
I don't think
he's gonna move.
Oh, he'll move.
Buck...
Move.
Sol-leks, come.
Come.
Allez!
Here.
Hey. Come here.
Hey.
What got into this dog
this morning?
No. Hey.
I think they know something
you don't know.
There's nothing I don't know.
Hey. Where did he go? Hey!
We can't make up
this much time.
They'll close the office.
No!
No!
No, no, no, no, no!
We were going
to be on time.
Just once!
Fine.
Take it.
It's not that bad.
I lost my lead dog.
We'll be two days behind
if we're lucky.
And we've never been lucky.
You might wanna...
- ...hang on.
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay, Buck.
And, mush!
Whoa!
Hey!
Yeehaw!
Go, Buck!
Go!
Yeah!
Yes, Buck!
Go!
Yeehaw!
Haw!
Buck, haw!
Turn left!
Left!
Turn left!
Go! Turn left!
No! No!
No, no, no!
Are you crazy?
No, no, no! No!
Go, go, go, go!
Faster, Buck! Don't stop!
Perrault?
Yeah!
This is it! This is it!
Don't let up now, Buck!
Yeah, that's it! Yeehaw!
Clear the way!
Move!
Go!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Did you see that?
We made it!
We did it!
Tupper.
Here's one for Kelly.
Yeah.
McCarthy, right here.
Anything for
Elizabeth Snow?
Is there
something for O'Malley?
- Laverne?
- Shaw.
I got three!
Laverne!
Doyle? Kennedy?
I've got
one for Smith. Here.
Lynch.
See, Buck?
We don't carry mail.
We carry lives.
We carry hope.
We carry love.
We leave in the morning.
Let's get some rest.
O'Neil? Walsh?
Gallagher?
Look.
Dearest Sarah.
The soul seems to have
gone out of me now.
Each day
starts with the memory
of our dearest son.
Tim's approaching birthday
reminds me
of all that's been lost.
The warmth of our home...
...the adventures
our son dreamed of.
I wish I'd found the words
to express how I felt
before the silence became
unbearable.
And I left.
I search for a place...
I might feel some
peace.
Though I fear
I will never find it.
Because I know
that as I am,
there may be no home
for me in this world.
- Don't leave. Don't leave!
- Mush!
No, no, no!
Whoa!
Buck! What?
You got time for one
more before you leave?
You're late.
It's just that
it's my son's birthday.
And I need to send
this remembrance to my wife.
You should have come
when we were taking.
Took time
to find the words.
Oh.
You learn to read,
we won't need Perrault anymore.
You are lucky.
Buck is the boss.
Anyone else?
Hey, Buck.
I remember you.
Thank you.
- Thank you for stopping.
- Now we go!
Ready, Buck?
And, mush!
Line up!
Yep!
Nice, Buck!
Yeah, that's it!
Straight ahead!
Yep!
2,400 miles in 80 days?
Buck is gonna
sleep till fall.
Perrault! One for you.
Looks official.
What's the news
from down south?
Good work.
Perrault?
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
You did nothing wrong.
You all done good.
Okay?
I'm sorry, Buck.
They don't need me
and my sled anymore.
By summer,
the telegraph will reach here.
A new way
to send the mail.
It's your team now.
You still have
a mighty journey ahead.
The ground
had shifted under him again.
Buck had lost another master.
Now he would have to be
the leader himself.
Until a new master
came along.
I promised you, didn't I?
And here we are.
You promised me gold.
Where is it?
In the dogs?
Get the sled loaded.
It's time to
stake our claim.
Let's go.
And...
Mush!
Mush!
Are they broken?
No. They're just lazy.
Buck?
Mush!
Charles,
persuade the beast.
Not the club.
Charles!
Put that down or I'll...
I won't go a step!
Charles!
Remember me?
Yeah, I know.
Your runners are frozen.
You'll help your dogs
a mighty lot
if you take the gee pole
and break 'em out.
Gee pole?
What is he doing?
Sir! Watch the Victrola.
Where are you
headed, mister?
It's none of your concern.
You didn't buy that map
in Skagway, did you?
- No.
- That old fairy tale.
Lost cabin.
River of gold?
You're setting off
too far into the spring.
Half that trail
is on the river.
Well, that leaves
half the trail fit for travel.
Oh, it means the ice
is gonna break up
with your companions
and the dogs on it.
Why don't you lay over
till the spring thaw?
Save your dogs
and your companions
the suffering.
And let some old prospector
beat us to the gold?
I'm not a prospector.
No, thank you.
I paid a fortune
for this team.
They'll pull my sled.
They're good dogs, sir.
They'll pull your sled.
They'll pull your sled
till they die.
Thank you.
Let's go.
All right, let's go.
And...
Mush!
You lazy mutts!
I'm not so sure
about those dogs.
Maybe you should've bought
a different team.
Maybe
we should feed them.
We should've stayed
on the trail.
Mush!
Make it stop!
Maybe they need
a little encouragement.
Mush!
Mush!
For the first time,
Buck knew
more than his masters.
Mush!
But the whip
offered him no choice.
Son of a...
Well, now,
we're going across.
Move!
I say you go.
Hal, he can't.
Move.
Don't you dare.
Hey!
That river ice is gonna
break up any minute!
You fool!
That dog is trying
to help you keep your life!
Hal!
Why are you so keen
to stop us?
You know where
the gold is, don't you?
You keep your filthy hands
off of my dogs.
Hal.
Hal, he said
we shouldn't cross.
Hal, are you sure?
Maybe we just leave the dogs?
I know
what I'm doing.
Mush!
Mush!
Don't do this.
Not to them.
Mush!
What am I gonna
do with you?
They're not here.
They're gone.
You've been sleeping
for two days
in my bed.
I'll be back.
Stay. Go.
Do what you want.
Whiskey.
I want the bottle.
They're all gone!
My dogs ran off.
My fortune lost.
You called it a fairy tale.
You didn't want me
finding the gold.
Easy, Buck, easy.
Buck.
- Easy.
- Well, you all saw.
This man and I
had business
and the dog went
for my throat.
Probably rabid.
You leave
that dog alone!
Buck, settle!
You see?
I say it gets put down
here and now.
- No. Come on, mister.
- You don't touch him!
No one puts
any creature down.
Until we hear
all the facts.
The man sucker punched me.
Buck, easy.
What might you have
on that belt, friend?
No guns
on the premises!
You okay,
John Thornton?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
What?
What are you
looking at, huh?
You got something to say?
Buck!
That's not very nice.
What did you do that for?
Hey, Buck!
Buck, what...?
Buck?
Bring that back.
Now what are you
gonna do, huh?
Buck? What are you doing?
Bring that back.
Buck, don't do this.
That's mine.
I need that.
Don't do this to me.
What'd you do?
Where is it?
Just, would you...
Get off.
Get off.
Buck.
Darn, you're big.
This was his birthday.
My son.
After he died,
his mom and I...
...we just grew apart.
She didn't wanna
be around me...
I didn't wanna
be around anybody.
So, I came up here.
Then I met you.
Hell.
It's around here somewhere.
Good, you're awake.
I put it...
Here it is.
Something I want
to show ya.
Come here.
This is a map
of the Yukon.
My son was always reading
adventure stories,
and he was crazy
about the news
coming out of the Yukon.
It wasn't the gold.
He didn't care about that.
It was the mountains.
He spent all day
looking at maps
and at pictures
of the mountains.
Dreaming about
what was on the other side.
Places no one had been.
Wild places.
"Let's go," I said.
He said, "Yeah, Pop."
We'd start there,
but then
he grabbed a pencil
and he drew a line
off the map
and he said,
"But let's go there.
"Off the map.
Where no one's been."
It's... It's a trip
he would've loved.
A real adventure.
We could go.
You and me.
See what's out there.
What do you think?
It's a canoe, Buck.
We're gonna ride in it.
Settle. Sit. Sit.
Sit, Buck.
Good. Good boy.
Ha. What are you doing?
Begging?
You're not my pet.
Are you comin'?
Get in here.
♪ Row your boat ♪
♪ Gently down the stream ♪
♪ Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily ♪
♪ Life is but a dream ♪
Come on, Buck.
Give us a song.
Maybe not.
Whoa!
Whoa!
I'm glad you're enjoying this.
Oh, you like that, huh?
I guess
we walk from here.
Your ancestors
used to roam here.
And mine.
Back when we were wild.
We come and go,
don't we?
This is always here.
What?
I don't know. Which way?
You tell me.
Go on. You lead.
Buck?
Ah. Look what you found.
Boy...
Look at this, Buck.
I don't think
we're off all maps.
A prospector, I guess.
Trash.
Trash.
Trash.
Treasure.
This is mine. All right?
Just leave it alone.
It's mine.
Good day.
It's your ancestors.
Wolves.
That's good, Buck,
but more like this, huh?
Damn fairy tale's true.
That's more like it, Buck.
Attaboy!
What?
What you looking at?
Go take a look.
Go on.
Go on.
Just be back before dark!
Buck!
Here,
so far from home...
I can see a change
in Buck.
Something's pulling him
into the forest.
Into the hunt.
That's beautiful, Buck.
Beautiful.
He's still the same dog
with me,
but I find it hard
to imagine him
back in civilization.
Is there any house
big enough to hold him?
This journey seems to be
leading Buck to his destiny.
Where is it leading me?
Not this time.
Long after dark.
You've been staying out
later and later every day.
Yeah, I know,
there's a lot to explore
but world's
a dangerous place.
You never know
what's coming.
You never know.
Fever took Timmy
in two days.
Hell.
Okay, Buck.
It's been
a beautiful summer.
You know what, Buck?
I've been thinking.
I might buy myself
a railroad.
Is that my hat?
That's my hat.
Come on.
Give me my hat.
Give me my hat.
Give me my hat.
Give me my hat.
Buck!
Buck!
Come on.
There you go.
Ooh.
Timber wolf.
Beautiful.
This is their domain.
They own these hills.
You wanna go?
Go.
Just...
...be careful.
He had been
both spoiled
and he'd suffered
at the hand of man.
Now, Buck found himself
with his own kind.
How far he has traveled
to find his home.
How far I have traveled
from mine.
Here, look, Buck.
Groceries.
For life.
No man needs
more than that.
It's time for me
to go, Buck.
Go home.
Whatever's left of it.
Pick up the pieces,
or at least try.
No.
I'm not asking you
to come with me, Buck.
You got something here.
Something important.
Hang onto it.
I'm leaving
in the morning.
Come say bye.
You're a good dog, Buck.
You're a good dog.
You came
all the way out here.
You knew something,
didn't you?
Easy.
You wanted it
all for yourself.
Where is it?
Where's the gold?
It's everywhere.
Take it.
Take it all.
It won't change anything.
It won't
bring back the dead.
Ah.
You know this, do you?
Good.
You see it, boy?
You see it?
Good.
Buck.
Yeah.
You came back.
Wow, Buck.
What an adventure, huh?
It's okay, boy.
You're home.
There is a place
in these mountains
where a new breed
of timber wolf roams...
wiser than man or wolf...
...because of the dog
that runs at the head
of the pack.
Now they live
without fear,
raise their young,
and flourish.
Some say
it's just a legend.
Not so.
You see,
I knew him once
when he was just a dog
at a man's side.
And even though
this land is his,
every summer
when he comes down
to the valley,
he remembers kind hands
and old masters.
Before he went
to his own,
became his own master.
Before he heard
the call.
