- How we doin' out there, Leila?
- Fuck you!
How you doing, my ass!
I'm totally soaked out here.
Aw, come on now, I pay you
two bucks a day, don't I?
Get off your lazy ass
and come and help me!
Cut me some slack, will ya?
I'm workin' hard too, you know.
[Game Beeps]
[Beeps, Dings, Static]
Now what?
- Son of a bitch. Pantucci!
- Ow! Shit, man!
[On Headset]
I'm flyin' blind up here,
Brainiac. I thought
you fixed the radar.
- It's a little temperamental.
You have to be gentle.
[On Headset]
Gentle, my ass.
The whole system
just crapped out on me.
- Killed off by your
negative vibes, no doubt.
- No doubt.
[Zaps]
- Are you hittin'
that thing again?
No.
[Yelling In Korean]
You know, where is it

out there and work?
I mean, you know, Finnegan,
why don't you get your ass
out there sometime?
I love you too, Leila.
- Everything all right?
- Just peachy.
[Man]
We are on schedule, are we not?
You didn't hire me
for my social graces.
We hired you for
your reputation.
You better live up to it.
- Where are we?
Right there.
Middle of nowhere.
- And our final destination?
- Right... there.
- Middle of nowhere squared.
- Finny.
Yeah, I heard of you.
But I thought you'd be older.
Like a fine wine,
I'm aging gracefully.
Thank you.
Like a fine wine, my ass.
You look more like
a keg of beer to me.
[Laughs]
Any questions, Mr Finnegan?
Nope. I get paid to shut up
and do my job.
So I shut up and do my job.
You're not the least
bit curious as to
where we're going?
Like the sign says,
If the cash is there,
we do not care.
Very good.

[Pinging]
- Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen.
Mesdames et messieurs.
If I could have your attention
for just one moment, please.
On behalf of myself,
Captain Atherton and his crew,
welcome to the maiden voyage
of the Argonautica!
[Cheering]
Each and every one of
the hundreds of men
and women... in service
upon this vessel...
has but one objective:
To make your dreams
come true.
As for myself,
my entire life...
I have had but one dream:
To create the greatest,
most luxurious,
most expensive pleasure ship
ever built.
And tonight, seeing
all of you here...
so beautiful, so elegant,
so rich...
[Everyone Laughs]
I realize that my dream
has come true,
and I thank all of you from
the bottom of my heart for
making it so.
To the Argonautica!
Good times forever!
[All Shouting]
Forever!
[Percussion Resumes]
[Passengers Laughing]
[Woman]
We're having a wonderful time.
This ship is so smooth
we can't believe it!
[Man]
She's state-of-the-art.
Not another ship
like her, ma'am.
She can hit a 40-foot
swell and not even put
a ripple across your martini.
It's been very nice
meeting you people.
I hope you enjoy the
rest of the cruise.
- Thank you so much, Captain.
Oh! Excuse me.
- Non, non, excusez-moi,
mon capitaine.
Really, very sorry.
Au revoir.
[Thunder]
[Scoffs]
Nice picture.
[Distant Wailing]
I hate this bloody water stuff.
- That reminds me, I'm hungry.
- You're always hungry.
Yeah. So?
I'm a growing boy, you know.
- You're still growing?
- You got a problem with that?
- Be happy I don't eat you.
- So what you realizing,
Mamooli?
Uh, well, that my goal in life
before I die...
is to make love to a woman
from every country on earth.
Like, countries
acknowledged by the U. N?
Or like, made-up countries too?
- What the hell does that mean?
- Like T. Ray's country.
Shut your face, Billy.
Australia's a country.
- Australia's an island.
- Well, technically,
it's a continent.
Ah, shit, man. Island,
country, continent.
If there's women there,
well, I'm interested.
You come to my country,
I shoot your ass.
Does he ever talk about
anything else but women?
Nah, not that I recall.
The only way to shut him
up is to shoot him.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah?
[Gun Cocking]
You ever thought about it?
[Man]
Every day.
[Knife Unsheathing]
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[Man]
Come on, boys.
- Sit down, right?
- Ooh, ooh.
[Chuckling]
Go back to Australia.
[Man]
All right, what's this, now?
Ooh, a book without pictures.
Well done, mate.
[Moans]
- You know what I want to eat?
I'll take a couple of
nice, greasy pig's feet,
some pickled monkey
brains and one of them
big elephant eyeballs.
Raw, so they pop
when you bite them.
[Imitating Popping, Slurping]
[Men Laugh]

Hey, knock it off. You're not
getting paid to party.
Ah!
[Finnegan On Headset]
Pantucci! Pantucci!
You're not where I think
you are, are ya?
Hola.
Listen, this radar's
still funky.
I can feel it, and it's
a very bad feeling.
You know how many uncharted
islands are out here?
I don't know. Two?
Very funny.
Wait 'til I crash this rig into
some goddam, no-name island.
What is this, a talk show?
I need some quiet time.
Over and out.
Whoa. Nasty.
[Hydraulic Lift Hissing]
- Whoa.
Hit you.
Oh, shit.
[Gasps]
Oh, shit.
- I'm feelin' a real
lack of love here.
- Get in there!
[Billy]
Ohh.
- Well, what do we
have here, fellas?
I found him snoopin'
around the cargo.
If there's anything I can
do to make your trip
more comfortable, come to me.
- G'day, mate.
[Men Shouting, Pantucci
Grunting And Groaning]
[Fighting Sounds

Well, don't just sit there!
Go help him!
- Are you kiddin' me?

No shit!

- I find you live
longer if you don't.
Finnegan!
[Punches Landing,
Men Laughing]
[Spears Piercing Metal]
[Pantucci Moaning, Panting]
We got a contract.
Twenty hours out and back.
You beat my engine man
to death, it's gonna take
a hell of a lot longer.
Which is okay by me, since
overtime will run you
double rate.
He was nosin' around
in my cargo.
Okay, so he's nosey.
The contract was
no questions asked.
Yo, fellas. I vote...
we kick this little
piece of shit overboard.
[Grunts]
- Well, I vote we kill him.
I vote we kill him,
then we throw him overboard.
Well, we don't vote here.
See, it's not a democracy.

Everybody okay? Anybody
gonna shoot anybody?
You know, you boys
ought to get out more often.
That's a year off my life.
[Thunder, Lightning Crashing]
Please enter
your security key card.
Good evening,
Captain Atherton.
- Good evening to you.
- The vault is now open.
Oh, choices, choices.
Ooh, you're a big, bad boy,
aren't ya?
Hmm. You're more my size.
Et voila, le necklace.
[Clearing Throat]
Good evening, mademoiselle.
- Hello.
- Red-handed. My God, what
a cheeky little trollop you are.
Good evening, gentlemen.
I was just on my way out.
[Chuckles]
- Or maybe not.
- A good decision.
There's no place to run.
The nearest land is...
What, 600 miles, Captain?
- Nearer 800, sir.
- According to this
fax we received...
- Oh, that's not a very
flattering photograph, is it?
You're wanted for burglary,
robbery, forgery.
Oh!
And attempted murder.
My ex-boyfriend.
What?
Six arrests, five convictions,
and wanted in four countries.
How does a beautiful woman
as young as yourself...
amass such an incredible
record?
- Trust me, it wasn't easy.
- I think it's because you're
not very good at what you do.
- Oh!
- Steady on, Canton.
No need for that.
Uh-uh!
I believe that's my card.
- Thank you.
- Do we have a brig
on this ship?
Yes, we do, sir.
But it's not finished yet.
- Can't put a lady in the brig!
- True.
But you, mademoiselle,
are no lady.
Hey, watch it!
[Sighs]
Hmm. And you, Mr Canton,
are no gentleman.
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Ow. Ow!
They must be 30 feet long, man.
They're not nukes or nothin',
but the bang sure would
make your butt pucker.
You ever pull that shit again,
I'll kill you myself.
Hold still,
you big dummy.
I'm sorry. It stings!
Hey, do you think we
could pull over?
You got any novocaine?
Oh, yes, my little love bug,
but just a little.
- I think I need
a higher dosage.
- You always need
a higher dosage.
- How many of those
things are there?
- Huh?
I don't know. Eight
or nine of 'em.
Enough to sink a damn
aircraft carrier.
This is just great.
Now I got bombs in my basement.
Maybe it's just me, but if
you'd ask a question or two
before accepting a job...
[Pantucci]
If the cash is there,
we do not care.
What kind of life philosophy
is that, man?
Torpedoes.
What the hell are they
gonna do with torpedoes?
[Soft Beeps]
[Beep]
Yes!
Gentlemen.
Say hello to the Chinese...
M1-L1 triple-pulse
assault rifle.
Rotating barrel,
thousand-round capacity.
- Auto cooling, watertight.
- Yeah!
Cheers, babe.
Mm-mmm!
[Electronic Whirring, Beeping]
[Beeping Continues]
[Crew Members Chattering]
- What?
What's happening here,
gentlemen?
Communications,
what's your status?
All thermal and laser imaging
generating a negative
white screen response, sir.
- That's impossible.
- Captain, radar not
responding either.
Right. Switch to
auxiliary power, Mr Lewis.
Let's do a circuit check.
No response, sir. We have
a complete mainframe meltdown.
- What about the
communications gear?
- Gone. All completely gone!
- Maybe it's the storm, sir.
- No, no. That's nonsense.
- This ship is
impervious to weather.
- Can we still send?
Our signal goes out
static, sir.
I've never seen
anything like it.
This equipment is
state-of-the-art!
Top of the line!
Mr Canton, please!
We are in a very dangerous
situation here.
We are running... without
radar or any form
of imaging; we are
sailing blind.
- No way to communicate
our situation.
- I have something here, sir.
- What is it, Colin?
- I don't know, sir,
but whatever it is,
it's, uh, big.
Probably just a pod of whales.
Moving at 31 knots, sir?
I don't think so.
- Where's it coming from?
- Directly beneath us, sir.
160 metres directly beneath us
and rising very quickly.
150 metres. 140. 130. 120.
110. 100 metres.
Ninety, eighty.
- Seventy, sixty.
- What are they?
Fifty metres.

Looks like some kind of...
It's a torpedo launcher.
- I... I don't like this.
- Yeah, I know. Neither do I.
- How much longer?
- Another 22 minutes,
we'll be right on top of,
uh,

in the starboard bow.
- Taking water?
- A little, but it's just

I got no power coming
from Jezebel.
She's out cold.
[Leila]
Something's wrong with Hercules.
He's not getting any petrol.
That's it.
I'm shuttin' her down.
Shit!
What the hell did we hit?
- We got a big-ass hole here!
- Get it out! Get it out!
Get it off the cases!
What the hell was that?
Whatever it was, it nearly
took my bloody head off!
[Laughing]
[Mamooli]
What are you laughing at?
'Cause we're alive,
you idiot.
A direct hit on any of
these warheads and pfft!
We'd be history, mate.
We got a hole in the starboard
bow the size of Nebraska!
What's the status down here?
- Old Jezebel got it
right through the brain pan.
[Finnegan]
You got me.
- I think we killed
a speedboat.
- A speedboat!
We're hell and gone
from the nearest land.
There's no way a speedboat
gets out this far. No way.
Ow! Shit, man! Finnegan,
nothing works!
Hercules is shot to shit.
His gears are all mangled.
His cylinder head
seized up, I think.
We're leakin' fuel fast.
I give us 20 minutes, half hour,
tops, and then we're dead
in the water.
Finnegan, you do something.
We have a job to finish,
a schedule to maintain.
- Man, would you listen
to this crap? -
Shut up, grease monkey!
- You're expendable.
Know what I mean?
- Yeah, I know.
Story of my life.
Hey, get your asses up here!
- There's something out there.
- What? Well, let me see.
- W-Wait! [Muttering]
- Let me see it. Let me see it!
Whoa. It's a...
It's a cruise ship.
[Finnegan] Do you think
she could spare some fuel?
And a few minutes
in her machine shop.
[Together]
Absolutely.
[Finnegan]
What the hell...
[Guns Cocking]
We'll take over from here.
You know, Hanover,
a ship like that,
they got half a dozen different
ways to call for help.
Not any more.
Pantucci,
can you fix this thing?
If I can get into
the Love Boat's machine shop,
yeah, maybe I can fix
this hunk of junk.
She ain't gonna run pretty,
but she'll run.
They've armed all
the bombs, man. They're alive.
All right.
- Finnegan and the grease
monkey will come with us.
- The three of us
stick together.
- From now on, you'll
be sticking with me.
- Billy!
- Yeah, Chief.
Finish the torpedo launcher
and watch the lady.
- Aye, Chief.
- I'll watch her.
I haven't done Korea.
Hey, Mr Comedy, leave my
girlfriend out of this.
You trying to fuck with me?
Hey, hey, hey!
Behave yourself. [Whistles]
- She'd eat you
alive anyway, eh?
[Man]
Hey, cool out.
Knock this shit off.
This is worse
than high school.
Cruise ship's not movin'.
Why ain't it movin'?
I don't know.
All right, gentlemen.
- You know the drill.
- Okay, let's move out!
♪♪♪
[Alarm Beeping]
Bingo.
[Finnegan] Relax, Hanover.
This is a cruise ship.
- You're not gonna
need your guns.
- What if they attack us, man?
With what?
Margaritas and tanning oil?
This place is a mess.
You want me
to call housekeeping?
Use any and all
force necessary.
The intimidation
factor must be high.
There's a lot of passengers
on this ship.
Yep, and half of 'em
are packin' lipstick.
- Careful you don't
get glossed.
- Cheer.
That was kind of fun.
Well, it was.
Everybody's in the atrium.
We'll pin 'em down there, then
split up and finish the job.
Sound off!

The hulls on these ships
are supposed to be impregnable.
[Mamooli]
So what are you sayin'?
If the hull's impregnable,
why are my feet wet?
It's a ghost ship.
- I vote we leave.
Who votes we leave?
- Shut up.
Mate, that's it.
They thought they were sinking,
so they abandoned ship.
Stupid bastards.
Oh, my God. He's right.
You're right. Yeah.

It was almost as if
the ship had struck a
reef or something.
It came to a sudden,
violent stop.
And then suddenly they
were everywhere.
Th-The passengers all panicked.
[Captain]
It all happened so fast,
there was no time
to do anything.
- Couldn't even use
the lifeboats.
- You okay?
Trouble is, nobody knows
we're in trouble.
Couldn't send an S.O.S.
Well, then, mon capitaine,
I think the first order
of business should be
a call for help, don't you?
- Yeah, man, call
in the Marines.
- Yeah, let's do it now.
Look, you don't seem to
understand.
- Something has
jammed the systems.
- Not something. Someone.
Who are you?
My name is Simon Canton.
I own this ship.
Hanover had a connection
on this ship,
somebody to knock out
all the communications.
[Gun Cocking]
[Finnegan]
You two know each other.
- It was you.
- What?
Very quick, Mr Finnegan.
- Is this true, Canton?
[Finnegan]
How do we fix it?
[Gun Cocking]
I said how do we fix it?
Answer him.
- Answer him, you
son of a bitch!
[Muttering]
All the systems were
melted at their core.
There's not gonna be
any calls for help.
[Gasping]
- For God's sake, man, why?
- Damn it!
This is supposed to be
your life's work, I thought.
This ship's gotta be worth,
what, a couple hundred million?
Four hundred eighty-seven
point six million dollars.
The insurance.
That's what
the torpedoes are for.
You loot the ship, and then
you sink it for the insurance.
I spent my whole life,
my entire fortune,
building this ship.
I'll be damned if I'm
gonna lose it to a bunch
of pencil-necked bankers.
[Captain]
Lose it, you greedy bastard?
What are you talking about?
- The ship was operating
at full capacity!
But the problem is that the cost
of keeping it operating...
is a hell of a lot more than
we're ever gonna take in.
You mean, we're all gonna
die because you screwed up
on the math?
[Canton]
I simply misjudged the market!
What about the passengers?
Were they insured?
I may be a crook,
but I'm not a savage.
The passengers, the crew and I
would've been safely evacuated
on the lifeboats.
Don't you get self-righteous
with me, Mr Finnegan.
I know all about you.
- You despicable,
lousy bastard!
[Grunting]
- You sold us out to
the bloody insurance!
- All right, knock it off!
Do you realize how many
innocent people you've killed
on this ship?
- Hey, hey, break this up!
- Innocent passengers!
[Hanover] That's enough!
[Canton]
Nobody was gonna get hurt!
- What?

[Wailing Recedes]
What the hell
are these goddam things?
I'm beginning to fear
that our friends here...
may be some kind of
strange offshoot...
of the Archaea
Ottoia family.
Oh, the Ottoia family.
And to think I was
startin' to worry.
At 4,000 feet,
the Ottoia are about
as long as a pencil...
with bodies about
the size of a golf ball.
But those at 20,000 feet...
have been found to eat
full-grown sharks.
At thirty
or forty thousand feet...
Well, you do the math.
This, uh...
This is not good.
Are we talkin' some kind of
mutated sea monsters here?
Who gives a shit what they are?
Just tell us how to kill
these motherfuckers.
The Ottoia
are very crafty.
[Canton]
They hide in burrows...
and catch their victims
with spiny tentacles,
and then they-they crush them
between massive jaws.
Yeah, and then they
eat you, right?
No, they drink you.
They drink you alive,
sucking all the fluids out
of a body before excreting
the skeletal remains.
All right, that's it.
Lesson's over.
- Here's the plan.
- Hey!
I'm still givin' the orders
around here, mister!
You stay here and give
all the orders you want.
I'm gettin' back to my boat,
cuttin' it loose and gettin'
the hell outta here.
Yeah, man.
I second that motion.
- Mind if I tag along?
- Feel free.
[Steam Hissing]
[Finnegan]
Which way now?
At the end of this passageway,
there should be an underpass
on the port side that'll
take us to the upper levels.
- The starboard.
- Port.
- I've got the blueprints to
the entire ship right here.
- Who do you think gave
you those blueprints?
[Electrical Shorting Sound]
I ask you, man,
could it get any worse?
[Power Surging Sound]

Thanks, Joey.
[Humming Girl From lpanema]

They must have ripped
a hole through the hull.
That's how they got in.
The power of these things,
it's-it's awesome.
- I'm glad you're so impressed.
- Shit!
- There's no way out
through this door.
- It's buckled right
to the frame.
- We can't go back
the way we came.
- Okay, Canton, it's your ship.
Any ideas?
There are more hatchways and
stairwells on the other side
of this wall.
The only way outta here
is down those steps.
[Water Lapping]
[Beeps]
- He's right.
- How far?
[Beeps]
[Sighs] It's 20 metres.
- Somebody's gonna
have to go and check.
- I volunteer to wait here.
- Me too.
- No way.
I'll go. But you're
comin' with me.
[Chuckles]
Good luck.
- And what are we
laughing at? Hmm?
If we make it through,
I'll fire two rounds.
- That means it's safe
to come through.
- Okay. Hey! It's mine.
Let's give the lady
a real gun, shall we?
You know how
to use that?
Yeah. If something comes at me,
I'll just pull the trigger
'til it goes away.
Careful with that.
It's got a hell of a kick.
I can handle it.
Well, if we're goin'
for a swim,
I think it's your turn
to carry the parts.
This is turnin' out to be
one hell of a day.

- Grabbed him.
[Mulligan]
No way this is happening!
This isn't bloody happening!
- Who's next?
- Now where do we go?
There are more elevators through
that hatchway over there.
I ain't goin' up in no
more elevators, man.
I agree with these gentlemen.
How much longer before
we can expect a rescue?
- I'm not waitin' on
any rescue party.
- We checked in just
before sunset.
It'll be another 24 hours before
they start searching for us.
Are you saying they're not
even gonna start looking
for this ship for
another day or two?
- Be a bit late by then, folks.
And we got creepy crawlies
swarmin' all over,
killin' us off left and right.
Makes for a bit of a tight jam,
don't you think?
I say we stay right here!
- Are you insane?
- No. No, man. He's right.
There's plenty of food here.
We can hold out until
they rescue us.
They're right.
This is the galley
for the crew.
It was built to be almost
entirely airtight
in case of fire.
With these hatches closed,
there's no way those things
can get in here.
You wanna wind up in jail,
Mulligan?
Better that than in the belly
of one of those things.
I don't care what you do, but
I'm gonna keep on goin'.
It's our only chance.
Back off!
They're wiping us
out one at a time.
I say we make a stand.
Right here, right now.
The whole damn
ship's infested, Finnegan.
We're not gonna make it
back to the boat anyways.
I'm not stayin' down here,
and that's a fact.
- Now, back off that hatch.
- I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I swear to God, I'll kill you.
- I'm not mucking about here.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Don't get hasty, man.
- We're not staying
here, Mulligan!
- I say we are!
[Weapons Cocking]
Last stand, eh?
[Mulligan]
We'll kick ass and take names.
You back off right now,
soldier,
before I put you down.
I once saw a guy
put a fish in a bottle.
And then he corked it
and sealed it tight...
and threw it
to a baby octopus.
Now, the octopus, he felt his
way all around that bottle.
And in less than two minutes,
he got the cork off,
slid inside,
and ate the fish.
And the moral
of this story is?
We're the fish.
Listen.
The ship's already
starting to sink.
What if they don't
get here in time?
[Trillian]
I-I don't want to drown.
[Pantucci]
Yeah.
Look, Mulligan,
you can do whatever you want,
but I am gonna
get my ass to the surface,
pray to God that my boat
is still there...
and those things
aren't crawlin' all over it,
and then I am gonna
bail the hell outta here.

They're pushing us
toward the bow of the ship.
What the hell is
at the bow of the ship?
- Which way?

back into the hold.
That's the way up,
through there.
