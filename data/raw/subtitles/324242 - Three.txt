Your symptoms...
...appeared after she left?
I think so
You weren't getting on well?
We sometimes argued
Well, your symptoms suggest...
...mental dissociation?
Mental dissociation?
Let me explain
Say you're very attached to someone,
and you separate
It may not be a real break-up
But when your loved one isn't there...
...this disorder makes you rather unstable
Is memory loss one of the symptoms?
What can't you remember?
What she was wearing at the time...
Why she left...
That's what I can't remember
It's a mental blockage
It's not uncommon
We'll keep an eye on you
Actually...
I'm also seeing strange things
I'm afraid something
bad has happened to my wife
WELCOME TO NEW TOWN
WHERE DREAMS COME TRUE
Dry Cleaning receipt
Home Phone Number
Back early, today?
Still no news?
No
You know, there's something
strange about this place
Back when there were still workmen on the site
and hardly anyone had moved in yet...
...I had a real weird experience
Who's there?
And that wasn't the only weird thing
This place must be cursed!
You know what once happened here?
My daughter should be home by now
I should go up
Oh, right
You go ahead
Message playing
You have one new message
...can't take your call...
Say something!
About what?
About what happened!
If I knew that, I wouldn't feel so frustrated!
Are you sure she hasn't called you?
What do you mean?
You think I'm in touch with...
my sister without telling you?
There was no message
I told you, she didn't call!
You know...
I can't shake this bad feeling
I passed a car-crash on the way home
A woman in the car had her face smashed
I have the feeling...
...something bad has happened to my wife
Suji Apartments
To Suji, please
Be a good girl now, Eunji
Don't let it get to you
Okay, thanks
Hey! Where are you going?
Mister! Mister!
Honey?
Darling...
WELCOME TO NEW TOWN
WHERE DREAMS COME TRUE
These puppets are imbued with my life and soul
When my time comes
They should pass on with me
Any person who dares to resist
or disobey these words...
...will know disaster and an agonizing death!
Don't hurt me!
I'm scared!
Master Tao! It's me... Gaan!
Let go of me!
I'm scared! Don't hurt me!
Don't be too sad, wife
Death comes to all of us
Sister, you were too young to die!
What happened, Gaan?
Why did Master Tao...
...send his wife and son out on the boat at night?
I overheard Master Tao...
...telling his wife to drown the puppets
Drown them?
Why would he want to get rid of them?
He loved his puppets!
Was he afraid that someone would steal them?
He'd rather destroy them than lose them?
There's a curse on those puppets, Master Tong
A curse?
Since Master Tao fell ill...
...he's often raved about the curse in his sleep
I took no notice at first
But then bad things began happening...
...to members of our troupe
Several people ran away
So I began to believe in the curse
You think the curse caused...
...Nuan and Little Dang to drown?
Master Tao knew something bad was coming
Why else did he want the puppets destroyed?
Maybe he made up the curse story...
so that no one would dare
steal his treasured puppets
Please excuse me,
I must go back to look after Master Tao
Be comforted, wife
Master!
Master!
Help!
Master Tao's house is on fire?
Quick!
Hurry!
Quick!
May he rest in peace
I don't like this
Wife, don't take what Gaan said too seriously
I don't believe in the curse
Then how do you explain what has happened?
It was his karma, wife
Now that it's over we should leave,
shouldn't we
Please?
Please!
No!
I'm staying!
Bua, don't go in there!
Now your fortune is mine, you bastard Tao!
What is that?
It's a piece of net, Master
Master, are you alright?
I'm fine
You can go now
Come here, Gaan
Have you ever performed Khon, Gaan?
Never, Master...
Master Tao only taught me puppetry
I was still learning from him when he fell ill
If you want to learn Khon, I can teach you
Really?
What if he dances like a wooden puppet?
I wouldn't be able
to stop laughing till my last breathe
Have you been hurt?
Bua!
Where did you get that?
Give it to Grandma!
Give it to me now!
Give it to Grandma now!
Mother... calm down...
tell me what is it...
Master, I mean no disrespect
but please be wary of the curse!
You think it was caused by the curse?
Fine!
Well then...
I'll undo the curse myself!
Now it's my time, you bastard Tao!
Your puppet is in pieces!
We'll see what your curse can do to me!
Hear me well, all of you
These are new puppets
And I'm the one who makes them live
You too will have a fresh start and...
...lead better lives than before
I and I alone control the spirit and destiny...
...of these new puppets
May all that is sacred be my witness
Master? What's wrong?
I don't know
There's a sudden pain in my leg
Father, let me handle the...
...hero puppet instead of Gaan
Why should I?
Because he is stealing my girl away from me
That's nonsense
After all, he's a better puppeteer than you are
That's an excuse! Why are you against me?
Because you're as bitter...
...and violent as the demon Tosagan!
Father...
Am I so much like a demon, Father?
Good luck to you all
Im, help me back to the boat
These puppets are imbued with my life and soul
When my time comes
...they should pass on with me
Any person who dares to
reSister-in-lawst or disobey these words...
...will know disaster and an agonizing death!
You will know an agonizing death!
No! No!
Come on, Master Tao! You don't scare me!
Die, you accursed thing!
Where the hell are you?
You two deserve to die!
Scum of the earth!
Ghosts!
Help!
Help! Fire!
Father...!!
Bua, my daughter... Let's get away from here
Bua...
No! Don't touch it!
What are you doing?
Bua!
No!
What is that?
It's a piece of net, Master
Gaan, you think these puppets are cursed?
Yes, Master
What is it?
Nothing... You can go now
