There, ladies and gentlemen,
on the other side of the lake,
we have the famous Villa Diodati,
where Lord Byron, the greatest
living English poet, resides in exile.
Romantic, scholar, duelist
and bestselling author of Chhhde Harold
he was forced to leave his native land
after many scandals,
including incest and adultery
with Lady Caroline Lamb.
''Mad, bad and dangerous to know,''
she called him.

Yes, yes, imagilned.

We dreamt of darklness and of fear,
of creatioln and the defialnce of God.
Atheists! Are you colntelnt, lnow that
God's emissary is selnt to pullnish us?
Whom God would destroy he first makes mad.
We are the gods lnow.
We have dared to call oulrselves ''creators''.
Oulr pullnishmelnt is that we have created.
Bult created what?
Hulh!

For God's sake, Mary, we can do it.
What we created with oulr milnds,

Yes, like God, we have created.
And perhaps God, like us, walnts to destroy
his creatulres before they destroy their creator.

Byron sulrvived her by two years,
