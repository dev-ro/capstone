Hey kid, come here.
How old are you?
I heard you came on this boat
when you were seven and never left.
You really lived just on this boat?
Gosh, then you won't know
anything about what goes on outside.
Hey kid.
That old man
isn't your grandfather, is he?
You two just sleep?
Why'd you dress so light?
Yeah.
Did you know that old man's gonna
marry that girl when she turns 17?
What a rotten thief.
I bet they cuddle up all night.
Don't look.
An arrow will pierce your eye.
Oh yeah,
I heard he tells fortunes.
- Fortunes?
- Yeah!
What kind of fortunes?
Old man, tell me my fortune.
My wife's been fishy lately,
and nothing's working out for me.
What lunatic reads fortunes
that way?
You're right.
What?
Fuck this!
Why?
Is your wife cheating?
Old man,
what you said was true?
- I'm asking you if it's true?
- What did he say?
For someone
who traps a kid on a boat,
what does he know
about fortunes?
You were kidding, right?
Think he'd kid around after risking
that girl's life to tell your fortune?
So what did he say?
Wedding Day
It's tiny.
Try catching one of these at least.
Go sit over there.
One, two, three.
Take a look.
Hey you, come here.
Come sit here, hurry.
This is you.
You came out better than
I thought.
Hey, are you living
with that old man?
You're really pretty.
Stay still.
I'll grab it for you.
Hold this. I'll look for it.
Now hold still.
- Get out of there!
- Where could it be?
I'll grab it for you.
Hey, I'll find it!
Let's see, where could it be?
Could it be here?
Asshole.
Come here.
Will it be okay?
Shit, we're the only ones here.
Old man, don't you think
you were too harsh on us?
- She's not there?
- No.
Go in.
She's not here.
See if there's a way out.
How old are you?
Have you been to Seoul?
You'd probably
be in high school.
You just lived on this boat?
Aren't you lonely?
Is that old man
your grandfather?
Dad.
Is that girl his granddaughter?
No, he found her
when she was six.
Gosh, it's been
ten years already.
Then she lived on
this boat for ten years?
And she never left?
I think so.
How could he do that to her?
He's a bad person.
Old man!
My business isn't doing so well lately.
Could you tell me my fortune?
Isn't this too dangerous?
What if she gets hit?
He wasn't a mute?
What did he say?
Why are you laughing?
What did he say?
What are you doing?
I didn't touch her!
What's with you, old man?
