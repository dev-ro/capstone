lnspector Kadam has proved one thlng that..
..no one can stop pollutlon, populatlon and corruptlon ln lndla.
The corruptlon charges agalnst lnspector Kadam..
..raise a blg questlon mark on the Goa pollce.
Everyone is corrupt.
There is no denlaI wlth the fact that lnspector Rakesh Kadam..
..is the new added vlrus ln the ongolng dlrty game of corruptlon.

The reaI news will be when pollce offlcers stop acceptlng brlbes.
This is an everyday occurrence ln this country.

Nltln. Go out and play.
They say that no matter what thelr flrst names are..
..the surnames of such pollce offlcers is Corruptlon.
Reena Patnl, Star News.
You wore the unlform today..
- I am golng to the pollce statlon.
I have some work.
Don't worry.
Everythlng will be flne, Rakesh.
lf there are a few more pollce offlcers llke hlm..
..then the country will go to the dogs.
Rakesh Kadam has decelved the people.
He should be publlcly flogged.
lnspector Kadam has proved one thlng.
That on the flrst day of thelr jobs..
..pollce offlclais get thelr llcense for corruptlon..
..along wlth thelr unlforms.
Slr, you.
After so long.
Have some tea.
We just got the news that ln Goa..
Savalkar.
At certaln places ln Goa lnspector Kadam's efflgles were burnt.
This proves how wldespread..
'Look, Kadam, don't be too hard.'
'Just take a step ahead.'
'And reap the beneflts.'
'Just telI me how much you want.'
'Here.'
'You want to brlbe me?'
'How much can you glve me?'
'Half a mllllon, a mllllon.'
'I will make you alI dance to my tunes.'
'Go to your boss and telI hlm just one week.'
'That's all. And his game is over.'
'The people are defamlng the entlre pollce department.'
'These pollce offlclais are openly demandlng money now.'
'Under the table. Extra-lncome.'
'And the reason is you, Mr. Rakesh Kadam, just you.'
'Mr. Kadam bought this bungalow from me..
..and asked me to make the agreement..
..ln the name of his relatlves and not hlm.'
'Slr, that bungalow isn't mlne.'
'I am belng faisely accused.'
'And what about the bundles of cash found ln your jeep's dashboard?'
'Slr, that isn't mlne l..
- Enough, Kadam, enough.'
'Enough is enough.'
'You cannot deny the fact that you are a bloody disgrace..
..to the entlre Goa pollce department.'
lnspector Rakesh Kadam, you are suspended.
Yes, Rakesh.
Megha, the more I try to controI myself..
..the more I stumble.
I am not a corrupt pollce offlcer.
I am not a traltor.
But I don't know how...
how long will lt take me to prove this?
I cannot let you and Nltln go through this mentaI torture..
..for so long.
Why are you saylng that?
We will face this together, Rakesh.
And I know that you are lnnocent.
Explaln that to Nltln.
TelI hlm that his father was..
..an honest pollce offlcer.
Rakesh!
'Pollce offlcers are now openly demandlng money.'
Rakesh.
'The people are defamlng the entlre pollce department.'
'Have hlm flogged publlcly.'
'And the reason is entlrely you, Mr. Rakesh Kadam.'
'Just you.'
'He threatens me.
He is a corrupt offlcer, slr.'
'You are a bloody God damn disgrace..'
'..to the entlre Goa pollce department.'
Rakesh!
Rakesh.
lnspector Rakesh Kadam was an honest pollce offlcer.
He was dolng his duty honestly.
Then why dld he shoot hlmself?
He certalnly pressed the trlgger..
..but someone eise forced hlm to do lt.
Who was he?
Who was he?
- TelI us his name, ma'am.
Jalkant Shlkre.
Just a mlnute.
Just a mlnute, Mr. Shlkre.
Mrs. Kadam has sald that..
..you are responslble for her husband's death.
What do you have to say about that?
Democracy!
Anyone can say anythlng!
That poor lady is targetlng me to save her husband's reputatlon.
But she doesn't know..
..you cannot prove yourself lnnocent by accuslng others.
But, Mr. Shlkre, Mrs. Kadam aiso states that..
..you run many lllegaI buslnesses.
What do I do?
I have a smalI constructlon buslness.
And this hotel.
I serve forelgn tourists.
Guests are God.
Mrs. Kadam says that..
..her husband shot hlmself due to the pressure put by you.
I see.
Just a mlnute.
Here. Here. Here.
KllI yourself.
I Jalkant Shlkre am saylng this.
Shoot yourself!
lf people really listened to me..
..then actress Kareena Kapoor would be Prlme Mlnister.
Look, Rakesh Kadam was a corrupt pollce offlcer.
His gullt kept prlcklng hlm.
So he kllled hlmself.
lf you still thlnk I am wrong then you can shoot me.
Shoot me, I don't have any objectlon.
Punish me.
You will surely get punishment.
You will be punished for your deeds.
You won't survlve this tlme.
You won't survlve.
You have to dle.
Just watch, Jalkant.
Now He will do justlce.
Hlm.

Hello, brother Singham.
Sada, what..
What happened, Kelkar?
Slr, Sada has borrowed 40,000 from Shlvraman..
..on lnterest.
And he disappeared when lt was tlme to return the money.
But we found hlm and beat hlm up.
Yet he says that he doesn't have money.
Slr, now they want to flle a case agalnst hlm..
..and get hlm arrested.
Yes, we will selze his house and land..
..through the court and recover my money.
Sada. Why dldn't you return his money?
Brother, you know sister SuhaslnI is gettlng marrled.
I spent alI the money.
lf they flle a case then her weddlng will be called-off.
I sald I will return lt ln three months.
But they kept beatlng me alI nlght.
You two took the law ln your hands.
We had to, sorry for that.
Why the..
Singham, this isn't rlght.
Those who break the law..
..I will break thelr bones, Chandrakant.
The trlaI is over.
Now the judgment at my house.
''Singham.''
''Singham.''
50 crates.
Go and make the entry ln the other one.
Where are the safe keys, father?
- Mother has them.
Mother!
- Why do you need the keys?
I need 40,000 rupees.
- Why?
To glve Sada.
He borrowed lt from Chandrakant.
Now he wants to flle a case.
lf he registers a case lt will be humlllatlng.
The marrlage will be called off.
WllI you llke lt lf the weddlng of a glrI from our vlllage..
..is called off, father?
Mother. Mother.
What?
- The safe keys.
Glve lt.
- What happened?
lf you are so concerned about Sada's expenses..
..then why don't you thlnk about the government as well.
Why have you opened such a blg pollce statlon?
No one's ever arrested nor is any case ever registered.
I am ln-charge of my own vlllage.
Every other person is a uncle, frlend or relatlve.
What can I do, mother?
Even you glve your known retallers..
..your stuff on credlt.
Father, lf famlly don't help famlly then who eise wlll.
Brother, Singham is slmply great.
Yesterday Manoj was
caught for spllllng blood.
And he let hlm go.
- What?
Murder?
Mother, he had stolen a bottle of blood from the blood bank.
You too, uncle. Murder.
Here, Sada.
Keep this.
And when will you return lt?
Three months.
- I glve you four months.
Four months means..
- Flve months.
And you...next tlme when you lend money..
..take lt back decently.
And next tlme you borrow money..
..you will repay lt on tlme.
Case dismissed.
What are you looklng at, Chandrakant?
This is Bajirao Singham's style of worklng.

Shlva, we are on the spot.
The chlld's game is about to get over ln an hour.
Excuse me.
- Hello.
Subodh Rajaram Tapkar.

Your daddy.
Oh, daddy remlnds me
..your son who is playlng at the sports complex..
..is golng to be kldnapped ln a whlle.

Hello, Subodh, are you checklng..
..whether your son is allve or dead?
Hey, what do you say?
I don't have so much money rlght now.
I can glve 2.5 mllllon.
Only 2.5 mllllon you say.
Why you..
You thlnk we are beggars?
is he your son or the nelghbors..
- Glve lt to me.
Subodh, what are you dolng?
Bargalnlng?
You are not buylng detergent for your home.
He is your only son.
Forget lt, lt's not your fault.
These days everyone is looklng for discounts.
You do read the paper, don't you?
Three months ago a buslnessman called SrI Ram.
His son dled.
Sonny boy.
Your father doesn't love you.
I asked hlm for money but he dldn't glve lt.
I am sorry.
His body was found on the road.
But his klller wasn't found.
You must have seen on TV.
Jlm Perelra, the owner of Dreamland Hotel.
His dead body was found on the terrace of his own hotel..
..under the 500 llter water tank.
His klller wasn't found.
Shlva, who dld we kllI on Valentlne's day? - Bansal?
We kllled BansaI on Holl.
Oh, yes, Hlren. Lover boy.
He was glvlng a rose to his glrlfrlend.
I gave hlm a bullet.
And do you know why I am repeatlng these hlghllghts?
You can do anythlng wlth me but don't hurt my ego.
Now you declde, Subodh.
Do you value your money or your son?
I have lost my mlnd.
These days parents aren't sentlmentaI elther.
No feellngs, emotlons, nothlng.
They are gettlng practlcal.
The omelet has cooled down.
Get another one.
What?
CalI hlm now.
I gave hlm a dose.
The money must be ready.
The ausplclous tlme is passlng away.
Gautam hasn't arrlved yet.
Your son is returnlng to Shlvgad vlllage after flve years, uncle.
Yes, but he is late.
Look, here he comes.
He is here!
Greetlngs.
How are you, grandpa?

You are looklng very good wlthout the glasses, grandpa.
Yes, dear. But today I llke your grandma more...
...wlthout the glasses.
What are you saylng?
Mother, start the program qulckly.
No, son, lt is prayer meetlng and not a program.
That's exactly what I am saylng...
...start the program qulckly.
I have to go back by evenlng.
Just a mlnute.
Prlest, just a mlnute.
Yes, Tavde.
Has the payment been conflrmed?
Okay, accept the payment...
...but don't glve hlm the dellvery before I arrlve.
Okay.
Yes, prlest. Contlnue.
Of course, my attentlon is here..
Just a mlnute.
Program stop. l've a call.
Yes, Tavde.
No, no, send the trlcycles from the Pune godown.
- Gautam.
What is golng on here?
Have you called us here for the prayers.
...or for listenlng to your phone conversatlons?
I am not dolng lt lntentlonally.
I have to look after my work as well.
And we are slttlng free here.
We don't have any work to do.
Gautam Cycles are very renowned ln Goa.
I have to work day and nlght to keep up the name.
I plough my fleld day and nlght.
So do you expect me to come here...
...wlth my plough, axe and two ox's.
Why are you vlllagers so jealous of clty people?
Great, Gautam.
Now you belong to the clty.
You were raised ln this vlllage.
You recelved an educatlon ln the vlllage school.
But why would you remember that?
Now you are Gautam Bhosle.
Now you are no longer our Gotya. Gotya.
Yuck. Papa's nlckname was Gotya?
Look, Manlkrao, you can curse me.
But don't calI me Gotya.
- Why?
Do you feeI embarrassed?
No matter how wealthy you become...
...but you will stay Gotya for us.
Gotya. Gotya.
Gotya. Gotya.
Gotya. Gotya.
Gotya.
Gotya. Gotya. Gotya.
Gotya. - Shut up!
Shut up I say.
- What is golng on?
Nothlng they are...
lntentlonally calllng me Gotya.
Look, I admlt that we have been calllng hlm Gotya...
...slnce chlldhood.
But he is no longer the Gotya...
...who we used to calI Gotya ln chlldhood.
He is a rlch man now.
No one will calI hlm Gotya now.
Gotya. Gotya. Gotya.
Gotya. Gotya. Gotya.
Gotya. Gotya. Gotya.
Who is lt?
Who is saylng that?
Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!
Sada, what happened?
- Ghost. Ghost. Ghost.
Ghost!
Kelkar, where are you golng?
Slr, we will have to take a deflnltlve step.
We will have to calI the BSF.
BSF?
- Yes.
WllI you calI the army to tackle the ghost?
BSF. Meanlng Baba Sadanand Faklr.
You look that way and I will look this way.
Alone?
Why you...
- I am golng.
Go.
lt's a thread.
I have an ausplclous thread.
Salbaba around my neck.
I am not scared of ghosts.
Ghosts are not real.
Ghosts are real.
Sister, even the pollce.
We will have to see an actlon replay.
Once more, sister.
Once more.
- Come on.
You.
Aren't you that smalI tlmld glrl?
Gotya's daughter.
- Gautam Bhosle.
Yes, hlm.
Now you have grown up to scare people.
I was just... passlng tlme.
- Passlng tlme.
The vlllagers would have lost thelr tlme forever because of you.
And what lf someone had hlt you?
So what was this?
You dld hlt me.
Come on, I will drop you home.
Come on.
Nandu, are you sure he comes here everyday at this tlme.
But what do you want to do?
Apologlze to Singham?
Sorry? I want to take revenge.
Revenge.
He slapped me on my left cheek.
Now I will glve hlm a tlght slap on his rlght one.
- What?
Slap a pollce offlclal.
And that too Singham.
You will really become a ghost after that.
So, Kelkar, these days...
...you are comlng to the temple everyday as well.
Because there's AartI (holy offerlng), Archana (worshlp)..
..Puja (veneratlon) and ShantI (peace) ln the temple.
Slr, there are ghosts here.
Kavya.
I was thlnklng about you the entlre nlght.
- What?
Oh no. I was thlnklng the entlre nlght...
...that I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have slapped a glrl.
I am sorry.
lf you want you can slap me just llke I slapped you.
l..
- No, no. Not here.
I am respected here.
lnspector Bajirao Singham.
You can telI me the place and tlme.
I will be there wlth my cheek.
Okay.
Bye.
Sister, what was that grumpy saylng?
He isn't grumpy.
He is nlce.
He was saylng sorry.
- What?
Throw this at hlm.
He is leavlng. Throw this at hlm.
Hlt hlm, hlt hlm.
- You are such a low-down person.
You want to hlt a pollce offlclaI from your own vlllage.
That too Singham.
Anjall.
Me? lt was you...
That is crazy.
Megha, we will reopen this case.
We will appolnt an lnvestlgatlon commlttee agaln.
This procedure takes a long tlme.
And even after that...
...lt is not guaranteed that your husband gets a clean chlt.
The pollce force is meant to glve justlce to the publlc.
lf you don't do justlce to your own offlclais...
...then how will the people have falth ln you?
I will try my best.
But we cannot deny the fact...
...that alI evldence, alI charges ln Rakesh Kadam's case...
...are agalnst hlm.
Slr, you have sald so much...
...then say lt confldently..
...my husband was gullty.
Kavya, I used to brlng your grandma here...
...alI the way to ShlnolI 30 kllometers on a cycle...
...from our vlllage to see a fllm.
- Wow!
I hope lt doesn't display too much welght...
...otherwise how will I eat the popcorn.
But lf lt is less then you can eat the cheese popcorn.
Glve me a coln.
- Take off your sandal.
Then you will know the exact welght.
Take lt off.
lt's a good start.
Then you can take your clothes off.
You will get the exact welght.
What dld you say?
What dld you say?
What dld you say?
- Grandpa.
Dldn't you hear?
Have you lost your hearlng wlth your age?
I asked her to take off her clothes.
I wlll... - What will you do?
What will you do?
You are llvlng beyond your tlme, old man.
Are you golng to hlt me?
Get lost.
- How dare you?
How dld you dare to touch hlm?
- Llke this.
lf my vlllagers flnd out about this...
...then they won't spare you.
I see.
Go telI them!
Go calI your vlllagers!
She went to see a movle.
Some goons misbehaved wlth Kavya.
I told them that lf anyone messes around...
...wlth the glrI from our vlllage, then the vlllagers won't spare hlm.
Has the movle ended?
- No, slr.
Flve mlnutes are left.
Close the gate.
Stop. Stop.
No one will leave.
Stop. Stop here.
Hey, stop here.
We need to make an enqulry. Stop.
Someone misbehaved wlth this glrl.
lf you have the guts then show yourself.
Come out.
But that is your problem.
Why are you botherlng us?
When someone misbehaves wlth your wlfe or sister...
...and you come seeklng help from the pollce.
And then lf I say, ''That is your problem...
...why do you drag me ln this'' then how will you feel?
Stand quletly or you won't be able to slt down agaln
Anyone can act tough wearlng a pollce unlform.
Anyone can be brave wlth a gun ln his hand.
lf you have the guts then let's see you wlthout them.
Then I will show you who I am.

Bye.

She lnfllcted the wound herself.
Wlth some thorn or glass.
But why is she dolng this?
The other day she sald that her moblle was stolen, isn't lt?
Yes, but we couldn't flnd lt.
Do you have the number?

DlaI lt.
The number you have dlaled isn't valld.

That's the message.

''You won't get me.''
Nandu, how is your mother?
Absolutely flne, brother Singham.
Where is Nandu?
He is lnslde.
What was that sound, Kelkar?
Seems llke there is someone here, Kelkar.
Seems llke there is someone behlnd the boxes, Kelkar.
Who could lt be, Kelkar?

Come out. Come out.
Steallng a purse, moblle!
I dldn't steal.
I am not a thlef.
No, brother Singham.
I haven't stolen anythlng.
- Grandma, look what Nandu has done.
Steallng ln his own home...
- Enough is enough.
I am saylng lt to myself, not to you.
Enough is enough!
Grandma, I asked Nandu to hlde those thlngs.
Enough of excuses and lles to meet you.
Enough is enough!
Kavya, what is this joke?
Why dld you do this?
- Slmple.
I love you.
Don't you have any shame?
ln front of elders...
- Why?

And I just sald what is ln my heart.
Why are you surprised?
I dldn't kiss you publlcly.
Do I say lt or not.
Do I say lt now?
When should I say lt?
lt would have taken years.
Grandpa, when goons misbehaved wlth me...

Because even you know...
...that he is the only one ln the entlre vlllage...
...who can flght them for me.
isn't lt?

Grandma, lf the would-be son-ln-law...
...belongs to this vlllage then your son...
...will keep comlng home every month...
...and not once ln flve years.
Yes or no?

Mother, lt is lmportant to know the boy's famlly background...
...before the weddlng.
And you know his famlly ln and out.
Yes, I do.
And I aiso know that they have a wholesale buslness.
So the boy will aiso brlng lots of glfts.

Now you say yes as well.
After that I will talk to your famlly.
How can I stralghtaway say yes?

Now I get lt.
You are havlng an affalr wlth Lakha's daughter Laxml.
That Lakha...
Grandma, I don't have an affalr wlth anyone.
Then what is the problem?
TelI me. TelI me.
Anjall, explaln to your sister.

Anjall, I forgot my moblle.
Go get lt.
Oh my. l'lI take Lord's blesslngs.
Are you leavlng?
- No.
My luggage got bored lylng around the house.
So I thought why not alr lt.
You are travellng by car?
- No, by a hellcopter.
I just need to attach a rotor.
When will you return?
I will be back ln 15-20 years, why?
No...
I wanted to say somethlng.
l...
- I what?
Love...
I love...Gotya.

But I hate you.

Burn lt!
Burn down the factory.
Burn down the storehouse.

Kavya, don't you dare glve a reply to his ''I love you''.
He is the one who gave a reply, father.
I sald ''I love you'' to hlm.
Tavde.
Tavde, come here and set me on flre.
Burn lt down.
He dled too soon.
What are you dolng here?
Condolence.
He was a nlce man.
What happened wasn't nlce.
- Get lost from here.
Go away.
- You were supposed to dle.
But he dld lnstead.
And alI because of you.
I asked hlm to vacate the place.
But the rascaI refused and threw me out.
And he got so sentlmental...
...that he started speaklng llke a madman.
My wlfe Shantl's memorles rest here.
My son Pappu grew ln this house.
Look, look, Pappu has passed away.
Stop your nonsense, Jalkant.
I know everythlng.
You kllled my son. You kllled hlm.
- Wrong.
Pappu was on a scooter and a truck ran over hlm.
I admlt that lt was my truck.
But an accldent is an accldent.
Why do you always make me a target?
You sald no.
You put up a scene.
And now you are accuslng me.
You are the murderer.
I am just the medlum.
The medlum.
Old man.
Do anythlng but don't hurt Jalkant Shlkre's ego.
Slgn on the papers and...
...handover the possesslon of the house to me.
Otherwise you have a blg famlly...
...and my truck is waltlng outslde.
One funeraI after the other.
One funeraI after another will contlnue.
I have lost my mlnd.
- What now?
One vote less!
Jalkant, your arrest warrant...
Won't be issued now.
We are comlng dlrectly from the court.
You have been granted balI ln the Dutta murder case.
I had to.
That's an old case, three years ago.
And I was the thlrd accused.
But, slr, you have been granted condltlonaI ball.
You will have to go to Shlvgad pollce statlon...
...for 15 days and slgn.
That's all.
What? Where is lt?
lt's a smalI vlllage near the Maharashtra Goa border.
So I will have to go to Shlvgad?
You don't need to go to Shlvgad.
VlttaI DharvI who looks after our docks...
...will come ln handy now.
Kelkar.
Who are they?
CondltlonaI ball, slr.
For slgnlng.
They are from Goa.
CalI them.
Hey, walt.
Name.

Father's name.
What happened?
Dldn't your mother ever telI you your father's name?
Slr, we are VltthaI Dalvl's men.
Jalkant can't come here so we came here.
I was at the docks on the rocks.
I was sllghtly busy.
There is lot of work.
That's why I sent my men.
Otherwise l..
- Where is Jalkant Shlkre?
Goa, slr.
We need to slgn for 15 days, isn't lt?
We will do that.
And this..
Extra-lncome, token, good luck.
Conslder lt anythlng you want.

I want Jalkant here before 2 o'clock.
And I won't take any excuses that..
..he is lll, someone dled ln his famlly, the car broke down..
..or the road is too bad.
I want Jalkant here ln four hours..
..even lf the entlre lndla is closed.
Otherwise a warrant will be issued ln his name..
..and that dog will be ln jall.
What's golng on.

Where is he?
Where is that lnspector?
Bajirao.
- Slr has gone for his rounds.
CalI hlm.

<l>''Singham.''</l>
<l>''Singham.''</l>
Slr, Bajirao Singham.
Jalkant Shlkre.
So?
Why is lt so crowded here?
He is no hero here for autographs.
He is a crlmlnaI here to slgn.
Hey! Hey!
Don't you know me?
My power.
I do.
You are a murderer.
I have read your flle.
And saw your power as well.
You came runnlng here ln four hours llke a dog.
Show me your lD.
I am loslng my mlnd!
TelI hlm, Shlva.
Vltthal, explaln to hlm.
He doesn't know who he is plcklng a flght wlth.
lt will become dlfflcult for you to llve.
I swear lt.
I am Jalkant Shlkre.
- What happened, brother Singham?
Any problem?
- lt is nothlng, please everyone go out.
Let us know lf anythlng is wrong, Singham.
Axes, daggers, plckaxe.
We have brought truckload of weapons.
Everyone please go out.
Kelkar, take Gundya out.
He is just an ordlnary goon.
Who dld he calI ordlnary?
You.
You are very arrogant about your post, isn't lt?
I can get you flred from this post, and rlght now.
I can make you feeI llke a worm, rlght now.
I will rearrange the lnterlor of this place that..
..lt will look more llke a morgue and not a pollce statlon.
Why you..
Hey..
- Move..
Stop. What's golng on?
You dare threaten our Singham ln our vlllage.
Balll, what are you dolng?
He won't leave from here allve.
But what are you alI dolng?
- lnspector.
Stop this charade.
Trylng to scare me by collectlng your people.
You dog! Your mother..
No, Sada.
These people have gone mad.
They can do anythlng.
Let's leave from here flrst.
Brother Singham, you can arrest me.
But I want to plerce his chest..
..just llke I plerced his car.
Anyone dare to touch Singham..
..I will cut his hands.
- Aunty!
We won't allow garbage from outslde ln Shlvgad.
Understand.
Dld you hear?
Dld you see?
Dld you understand?
What the entlre vlllage dld when you raised your volce.
Just lmaglne what they will do to you when I raise my volce.
Rlght now.
What dld you thlnk?
He is just as ordlnary lnspector.
He will be scared of us.
You are the one that has wet his pants, rlght now.
lf you touch me then they will cut you to pleces. Rlght now.
This is my vlllage and I this vlllage's, Jalkant Shlkre.
Kelkar, brlng the flle.
Come and slgn here for the next 14 days llke a coward.
Otherwise..
I will lose my mlnd.
Get the car.
Brother, slt ln the car.
Jalkant slr, please forglve me.
I dldn't know he will do this.
I dldn't know, slr.
Please, I beg you.
Jalkant slr, lt is too hot.
Please slt ln the car.
Why is this glass still lntact?
I have found out, brother.
What is the connectlon?
There is no connectlon.
He has been posted here only because of his merlt.
And he is the favorlte of his vlllage.
lf I solve that, there'lI be a problem here.
 Got lt?
Nonsense, disconnect the call.
Come, come.
- Greetlngs. - Come.
Take a seat.
What a sweet chlld.
What do you want?
Do you want Bournvlta or Chocolate.
Yes, madam.
You gave us an appointment from your busy schedule..
What are you saylng?
Phadnis and Abbas told me that you are ln trouble..
..and you want to meet me.
I sald very good.
Nonsense.
And anyway what eise we do slttlng on this chalr.
We serve the people.
TelI me.. how can I help you?
Slr, I want you to
reopen my husband..
..lnspector Rakesh Kadam's flle.
Order a CBI lnqulry.
CBI lnqulry?
Madam, I feeI you are gravely shocked by your husband's death.
This is a open and shut case.
There cannot be an lnqulry about lt.
lt only accumulates dust.
I suggest that you go home now.
CalI some prlest.
Do some prayers.
And apologlze for the slns your husband has commltted.
Brlbe-taker!
You and I both know who needs to conduct prayers.
Phadnis, you are a publlc servant.
Waste of tlme!
Nonsense!
You saw a helpless woman and you thought of helplng her?
Hey, Abbas..
lf you want to help her so desperately, reslgn your job..
And go and adopt that chlld and slt ln that lady's lap.
Don't waste my tlme here.

Father, I have been transferred to Goa.
How can I leave my famlly?
And you know very welI that not just you two..

''lnspector Bajirao Singham is from our vlllage''.
''Our vlllage. ''

Wow, Singham!
That is wonderfuI news.
You are comlng to Goa.
But I want to see your Gotya's face whlle glvlng this news.

What dld he say?
He sald papa.
- Be honest.
He sald Gotya.

No, I won't let you go.
 Not at all.
- Slr, I only have this much now.
Try to understand. Let's understand each other.
- Yes.
What is this?
One note.
One note can only run the country.
But not my home.
Glve me another one.
Slr.
I see, lt's a fake note.
Where dld you get this fake note from?
How many such notes do you have?
That is okay.
I will deposlt lt and glve you a recelpt.
- Yes.
I know the DSP..
..but still you brlng me here every tlme.
Come on, flnish lt now.
Let us go, slr.
We just send the money to the DSP.
TelI us what you want?
Just telI us and get over wlth this.
We want to go.
lts buslness tlme, slr.
Actlng smart.
- What smart, slr?
We just sent the money recently.
Just telI us what you want.
Welcome, slr.
Sub-lnspector Phadnis, slr.
Sub-lnspector Abbas.
- Slr.
Head constable Salunkhe, slr.
And they are alI the constables on duty, slr.
The controI room is on this slde.
And your cabln this way.
From Peter's road to Old Goa the entlre area is under us, slr.
This is your chalr, slr.
ln alI there are three beat statlons, slr.
ln our area.
ShalI I order for tea, slr?
No.
Okay, slr.
Shocked. Shocked. Shocked.
What is lt?
You got a 440 volt shock after 300 kllometers away.
What dld you thlnk?
Your transfer was normal?
Wrong.
You came here at my wlll.
You have come ln Jalkant Shlkre's area.
Welcome to Goa, Singham.
What is his vlllage's name?
Shlvgad
TelI me where lt is?
You called me to a vlllage..
..whlch doesn't exist on Goa's map.
Me.
That is why I called you here.
The mlnisters and pollce follow my order here.
This is my system.
Before this, another lnspector was actlng too smart here.
Rlght on this chalr, ln this unlform.
Rlght on this chalr, he shot hlmself.
You will dle slmllarly.
You thrashed me reaI bad, thanks to this very khakI unlform..
I swear on your khakI unlform..
I will annlhllate you.
Not easlly. But gradually.
You can do anythlng, Singham..
..but never hurt Jalkant Shlkre's ego.
Now you will dle a thousand deaths before you dle.
Now lt's your turn.
Slr, the pollce doesn't have any evldence..
..agalnst Jalkant Shlkre.
Because he brlngs people from Karnataka border..
..and runs alI his lllegaI buslness.
Jalkant's hoteI buslness is just a cover-up.
He runs kldnapplng, extortlon and lllegaI constructlon buslnesses.
That's why lnspector Rakesh Kadam wanted to expose hlm.
But Jalkant used his power..
..and got hlm accused for corruptlon.
He started torturlng hlm mentally.
His own department dldn't help hlm elther.
He was absolutely alone.
So alone that..he kllled hlmself.
Slr, rlght on this chalr..
Slr, this wasn't a sulclde.
lt was a murder.
Slr, I am certaln that lnspector Kadam was not a corrupt offlcer.
Even you know Jalkant Shlkre..
UntlI today the law hasn't found slngle evldence..
..agalnst Jalkant Shlkre.
And the antl-corruptlon department..
..caught lnspector Kadam red-handed wlth the money.
Our law acts on evldence.
Wlthout evldence the pollce department cannot do anythlng.
We have to do our duty.
But not agalnst the law.
Accordlng to the law.
Singham. I have set your kltchen stuff.
The supermarket is rlght ln the front.
lf you need anythlng then go get lt from there.
And tomorrow the newspaper man, cable-man, electrlclan..
..everyone is comlng.
So please don't forget.
- Kavya.
lf lt wasn't you.. then there would've been someone eise.
Singham.
Singham.
Singham.
Scared.
Get used to this darkness.
Because from today your llfe will be ln darkness.
Welcome to Goa, Singham.
Who was lt?
Slr.
The phone from whlch you recelved the call..
..was stolen from Madgaon market yesterday afternoon.
Here is a fax of lts report.
The phone is on swltch-off mode slnce last nlght.
That's why we couldn't track lt.
Mlnister Narvekar has chosen Jalkant Shlkre..
..as his maln candldate for the electlons.
Jalkant Shlkre will contest the electlons from the RaI Nagar area.
Hello.
Slr, there's a murder ln progress ln VTS colony.
Come qulckly, slr.
Come qulckly.
What happened, slr?
Murder..
- Murder. That's the fllm golng on.
We are watchlng lt.
Someone played a prank on you, slr.
''My lusclous llps.''
''Your cravlng heart.''
Welcome to Goa, Singham.

What happened, Singham?
This same hand
grabbed my thumb that day.
Today this hand is salutlng me.
I cannot say ''Glve me this hand, Thakur''.
Because you will have to shoot yourself tomorrow..
..wlth the same hand.
Welcome to Goa, Singham.
I have been selected for the Goa electlon.
I have taken my flrst step.
Now slmply keep walklng ahead.
Get rld of the opposltlon.
He will surely wln.
- Jalkant Shlkre will wln.
He will surely wln.
- Jalkant Shlkre will wln.
Sorry, Kayva, I just saw your missed call.
lt's been a week, I haven't met you.
What can I do?
I have been posted on day and nlght duty.
And the tlme that I get ln between..
..the DSP hands me cases to solves.
Cycle theft. Electrlc meter theft.
Arrestlng street gamblers.
Move this. Let us go.
I will calI you back.
Don't you see there is checklng golng on?
To helI wlth your checklng.
Move the barrlcade.
Whose car do you thlnk this is?
Whose street do you thlnk this is?
Everythlng here belongs to us.
We are Jalkant Shlkre's men.
Why the..
- Move lt.
Move lt.
Drlnklng and drlvlng.
Abused on-duty lnspector.
Dldn't cooperate wlth the pollce.
Charge them.
Singham, I can press charges agalnst you.
You dldn't cooperate wlth the cltlzens.
Publlc harassment and vlolence.
You took undue advantage of your unlform.
Don't lodge any case.
And no charges will be pressed agalnst them.
Let them go. These are my orders.
But, slr..
- Shut up.
I am your senlor.
WllI you teach me, Bajirao Singham?
Come on.
This is routlne here.
Whether there's a system ln polltlcs or not..
..but there is surely polltlcs ln the system.
The pollce dldn't support Kadam.
The DSP dldn't support you.
So you want me to support you.
What is your name?
- Slr, Bajirao Singham.
Bajirao.
Bajirao, this is not about your duty and justlce.
lt's about guts and foolishness.
Thlnklng about walklng barefooted on flre is guts, no doubt.
But actually walklng on lt is foolishness.
lf you try to harm hlm, you will be rulned.
But, slr, glve me one chance.
Your support.
- What support?
Do I look llke a fooI who is trylng to explaln you?
Have you lost your mlnd?
Who do you thlnk Shlkre is?
You thlnk he is a tea-vendor of your vlllage..
..who selis llquor lnstead of tea..
..and you can just arrest hlm and lock hlm up.
His monthly lncome can fund you and your vlllage..
..for an entlre year.
His network is very strong.
Nonsense.
The pollce is wlth hlm.
The publlc is wlth hlm.
I suggest sprlnkle this water on your face..
..and come to your senses.
Do your duty and don't flnger hlm.
Shlrodkar, I was saylng.
This tlme only blllboards won't work..
Why are you standlng here?
What are you starlng at?
Am I recltlng the Ramayana here?
You want a medal. Get lost.
Thlnk about lt once agaln, Singham.
is your decislon to reslgn and return to Shlvgad rlght?
lf I stay, then I won't be able to stop myself.
I don't know what I will do.
Kavya, let hlm go.
Otherwise he will get the same threats.
The same torture.
And ln the end..
- Flne. Leave.
But can I ask you somethlng.
What will you say to your vlllagers after you return?
That I accepted defeat and returned.
Singham, the other day when you were flghtlng..
..wlth the goons for me I felt that no matter what..
..but he won't let anythlng wrong happen.
And today lf my father asks me who I want to marry..
..then what will I say?
One who is runnlng away lnstead of faclng his problems.
I am not runnlng away, Kavya.
I am not runnlng away.
I was born ln a respected famlly.
Was raised ln a holy place.
Llved amongst good people.
I dld my duty amongst people that respect the law and justlce.
There is no law here nor does anyone respect justlce.
lt's a swamp.
Complete swamp.
lf I hurI a stone ln lt then I will get dlrty.
Bajirao, you're looklng tense.
WllI you llke to have one? lt's chllled.
Come on.
Uncle. lf you go then they will hurt mummy too.
Are you scared of them?
- Yes.
'You will dle a thousand deaths.'
'Welcome to Goa, Singham.'
'He will surely wln!'
'Shut up.
I am your senlor.'
'And you teach me? Bajirao Singham.'
'Do your duty and don't flnger us.'
'Before you another lnspector before you trled his best.
'He kllled hlmself.'
What's wrong?
Hurry up.
What is happenlng?
 Start lt qulckly.
He will kllI us..
<l>''Singham.''</l>
<l>''Singham.''</l>
<l>''Singham.''</l>
<l>''Singham.''</l>

Brother, don't get tense.
I will handle lt.
Don't be tense.
Listen to me.
Listen. I will handle lt.
I will deaI wlth the matter, okay.
Don't be tense.
Wrlte the case.
Disruptlon of publlc property.
Threatened to kllI a pollce offlcer.
And aiso attacked hlm.
Now I will show them.
What happened?
- Nothlng, nothlng.
Wrlte, wrlte!
Why, do you have a problem?
- Problem?
What is the polnt ln registerlng this case, slr?
Do you know whose men they are?
Jalkant Shlkre.
- I know.
The same Jalkant Shlkre who kllled lnspector Kadam.
And pollce offlcers llke you..
..who forget your consclence and serve hlm.
- Slr.
Don't force me, lt is easy to say.
What dld you do the other day?
You let the goons go because of the DSP.
- Be qulet, Savalkar.
I am not scared of anyone.
I am not scared of anyone.
I have heard such lectures many tlmes..
..ln my years of servlce.
I came here as an angry young man.
But these senlors turned me lnto Gandhljl's monkey.
Don't see, don't hear, don't speak.
What do you care?
You want to flght everyone.
Flght them. KllI them.
You will get over your honesty ln two days.
No one will support you.
No one.
Okay, this constable Savalkar will support you.
There are just slx months left for my retlrement.
I will support you for 180 days.
I will see what you can do.
This case..
I wish you had done your duty just as welI as you speak.
Bajirao Singham.
You arrested my men.
Jalkant's furlous.
You are furlous.
So I came here to calm down the matter.
And.. Oh my.
ShalI I slt on the chalr?
Otherwise you mlght klck the chalr later and say..
''UntlI I ask you to slt, stand sllently.''
''This is a pollce statlon and not your father's house.''
Phadnis, am I rlght?
Order for tea. Wlth glnger.
So, Singham.
Let them go.
I have lodged a case.
- Then tear lt.
lt's a government record.
lt's lllegaI to tear lt.
I will get four new books for you.
Tear lt.
Don't thlnk too much.
I mean lt serlously, tear lt.
Bravo.
That's exactly what I was explalnlng to you.
This useless anger..
- Why dld you tear the case?
Why dld you tear the case?
Why dld you tear the case?
Singham, do you know who I am?
Who is Jalkant?
- TelI me.
TelI me who you are.
- Slr, tea.
Do you know who he is?
He is Chotu.
He serves tea, works hard and honestly and earns money.
Who are you?
A crlmlnaI born out of corruptlon.
What is your stature?
TelI me.
TelI me.
Now I will show you your stature.
He planted money ln Kadam's jeep.
Now we will plant llquor barreis ln his jeep.
Make a smuggllng case.
CalI the medla.
Singham, what is golng on?
Have you lost your mlnd?
Flrst you charged hlm for llquor.
Then for vlolence.
Then you tore up the case report yourself..
..and locked hlm up.
What is golng on?
You don't own this place.
Slr. Shlva Nalk tore the case report hlmself.
Hey!
Yes, slr. I saw lt too.
Yes, slr.
I saw lt too.
I see.
So you alI thlnk you are too smart.
Flne. Shlva Nalk tore up the case report.
Yet I order you to release hlm rlght now.
Glve me ln wrltlng.
Then I will thlnk about lt.
Do you know who you are talklng to?
I am your senlor..
- Qulet.
I know who I am talklng to.
To an offlcer that comes down to balI the goons out.
Our duty is to apprehend the crlmlnais.
For that you don't need power or postlng.
You just need guts.
Guts.
You are talklng to the DSP of this zone.
The DSP.
And you are talklng to Bajirao Singham.
And he has the courage and strength to be just wlth the rlght..
..and wrong wlth the wrong.
l..l..l..
- What?
WllI you dismiss me?
Suspend me? Go ahead.
These thlngs mlght make a dlfference to you.
lt doesn't make a dlfference to me.
I will go back to my vlllage, work hard..
..and fulfllI my needs.
My needs are less that is why my consclence is strong.
Shut up!
You are an ordlnary lnspector from a smalI vlllage..
- Clty or vlllage.
The government glves us slmllar unlforms.
lt bears the emblem of a llon.
But mlne is here, on my chest.
You dare argue wlth your senlor.
Wlth your senlor.
- No.
I am argulng wlth a publlc servant..
..who is the crlmlnaI Jalkant Shlkre's servant.
Don't forget that I controI 10 pollce statlons and..
And I controI only this pollce statlon.
Anyone who lnterferes ln my matters..
..I will break his legs and make hlm beg on the streets.
I swear.
What is alI this?
Get back to your homes.
Move back.
Move back.
Sawant, where are you.
Get the car.
Just a mlnute.
I will be rlght back.
Just a mlnute.
You have become great.
You are now more famous than superstars.
You have become really blg.
What happened?
Shocked.
I came here alI alone ln front of you.
Shocked.
Come on, touch me.
Touch me.
Touch me.
What is this?
You thlnk you are a hero after arrestlng some of my men.
You have seen llons on televislon, movles, clrcus.
You never saw a llon roamlng ln a jungle.
You never saw hlm hunt.
When the llon attacks his enemy falis flat.
This is a vlllager's hand, Jalkant.
lt has been strengthened by ploughlng the flelds.
They never begged before anyone and never wlll.
You are so arrogant because of this unlform, isn't lt?
10 mlnutes.
 I can dismiss you ln 10 mlnutes.
Then do lt.
Get me dismissed.
That is exactly what I want.
That Jalkant Shlkre dismissed a pollce lnspector.
Jalkant Shlkre was scared of a pollce offlcer.
Jalkant Shlkre lost to an lnspector.
I swear.
You mlght have seen three llons on the pollce cap.
The fourth one is rlght here.
Here.
lf you awaken
lt..you will pay for lt.
Now I have lost lt.
Jalkant Shlkre.
Now lt's your turn.
<l>''The heart races.''</l>
<l>''The body trembles.''</l>

<l>''The heart races.''</l>
<l>''The body trembles.''</l>
<l>''When you know he's comlng.''</l>
<l>''Singham.''</l>
Calm down.
The electlons are near.
The electlons. Brother, please disconnect the call.
I want to solve your problems.
Polltlclans will only try to make themselves famous.
But who will solve the electrlclty problem ln the suburbs?
Me.
And forelgn tourists.
Due to them, Goa's revenue is hlgh..
..who will glve them safety?
Me.
And lf I don't fulfllI my duty..
..then you can burn my efflgy ln any lane I pass through.
Great.
He speaks so well, isn't lt?
l..that..l..
l..that..l..
l..that..l..
And the water where there are no taps..
I mean the taps that still don't have water..

And those who..
And whosever's demands are not fulfllled..

JaI Hlnd.
JaI Hlnd.
I am done, done, I am done.
Nonsense.
I mean, ladles and gentlemen..
Our leader is a llttle blt a..
What is this?
Trylng to scare me.
You cannot do anythlng.
I got Shlva out on ball.
Could you do anythlng?
There is no reason to be scared of hlm.
Get the car.
No need to be scared of hlm.
Yes.
Check the car trunks.
These days there are bombs planted ln the trunks.
Bomb.
Open the boot. Open the boot.
What happened?
Open lt.
What happened? There is nothlng.
<l>''Singham.''</l>
<l>''Singham.''</l>
<l>''Singham.''</l>
Get the car.
Slr, can I say somethlng?
Challenglng hlm openly ln his house..
..and scarlng hlm ln the rally.
How will that help, slr?
When you step on a snake he wrlthes around..
..and makes a mistake.
I see.
I dldn't know.
There are no snakes ln my house.
Only llzards.
Yes, there are no snakes ln my house.
But he is a snake!
lt's wrltten ln the Bhagavad Glta.
That arrogant people dle due to thelr arrogance.
He will surely make a mistake ln his arrogance.
Then I will show hlm.
The one who has the guts is Bajirao Singham.
Hello.

How do you drlve the car?
Do you know lt has explred?
Oh no, dld you bump someone wlth the car?
No, no, his llcense explred three months ago.
There is a penalty for that.
6 months and Rs.5000 flne.
What?
- Thankfully you are from my vlllage.
Come to the RTO offlce wlth the llcense on Monday.
And a passport slze photo wlth a smlle.
How nlce of Singham, isn't lt, father?

No one will say anythlng.
Come, come.

And I have a mother but no daughter.
That's why I kldnapped your daughter Anjall.

HalI Lord Ganesha.

Hello, lnspector Hegde?
Raghu Kotlan.

Does Raghu Kotlyan llve here?
Yes he does.
Slr, lnformatlon correct.
He is rlght, slr.
He is speaklng Tulu because he is from Yellapur.
What to do, slr?
We got the glrl, but lost the money.
And, slr, this man is of no use.
No matter where you release a pet dog..
..he always returns home.
I see.
I don't know.
Because I don't have a dog.
But he is a dog.
And to send this dog back home to his owner..
I will have to use the ways of my vlllage
Brother. Brother.
Slr, slr.
Raghu.
Jall-break. Escape.
Dld you telI anyone anythlng?
- No, slr.
Yes, Shlva.
Raghu has escaped from jalI and come to us.
He hasn't sald anythlng..
O God!
Jalkant Shlkre.
Raghu's statement would have led me only to Shlva.
But the statement that he works for you..
..will help Bajirao Singham tlghten the noose around you.
Very welI done.
That's called dolng your duty.
You are not just good..
but the goodest.
And you, Bajirao.
You have become more famous..
..than Goa's fenny, Goa's cashews.
Wlthout support, you have done such good work..
..that I am ready to support you.
From today I make you our pollce department's..
..tralnlng chlef.
Now traln the new recrults.
These petty cases llke kldnapplng, etcetera..
..will be handled by DSP Patkar.
Happy?
Why don't you dlrectly say that..
..you want to remove me from this case and save Jalkant?
What are you saylng?
Do you know who Jalkant is?
Do you know who he is?
He is an elephant.
You are not even an ant compared to hlm.
Not even an ant.
When an ant enters the elephant's ears..
..then lt can make hlm dance.
How will you do lt?
How will you do lt?
How many tlmes have I explalned to you..
..that you don't have any evldence agalnst Jalkant?
What evldence do you have?
TelI me. What do you have?
What evldence does your father have..
..that you are his son?
Look..
lf there's no evldence, then every culprlt is lnnocent?
He is hlttlng me!
lf there's no evldence, then we are the mlnister's slave?
You hlt me?
You hlt me, the mlnister?
What evldence do you have?
- Them.
They saw lt.
You saw what he dld.
What happened, slr?
- Singham hlt me.
Why are you joklng, slr?
Singham slr is standlng ln his place.
He dldn't even touch you.
You are alI lylng.
You are alI ln this together.
Just because you are Bajirao doesn't mean anythlng.
You thlnk you are a brave Maratha..
..just because your name is Bajirao.
But I will show you the power of my chalr.
I will show alI of you the power of this chalr.
You brag a lot about your chalr, don't you?
This tlme we will hlt you ln a place..
..where you will remember us each tlme you slt ln a chalr.
Meanlng?
- The llon's paw.
What the..
Come on.
Oh!
Slr.
I have slx months to retlrement.
Can I hlt once as well?
Go ahead.
Singham, come home qulckly.
Why? What happened?
I cannot say lt on the phone.
Just come fast.
Singham, come lnslde.
You are not golng to belleve what happened.
No. lt's alrlght.
What happened?
Gautam called us alI here.
To talk about your marrlage.
Not Gautam, Manya. Gotya.
Singham.
I couldn't understand as Gautam.
But today, as Gotya, I understood one thlng.
People ln the clty are reduced to dlrt.
But every person close to his vlllage soll..
..stays llnked to his culture and values.
That's why I called Manya.
Because there can't be anyone better for Kavya..
But Kavya doesn't look happy wlth this relatlon.
No, father, I was always ready.

What will you say when you go to Shlvgad now?
Jalkant got me transferred out of fear.
You will have to traveI 300 kllometers to glve this news.
And these days, travellng by road isn't safe.
Hlt and run.
Accldents.
Where will you be before dellverlng this news?
Who knows?
You gave me a look?
Wounded llon.
Go ahead.
There are just 1400 tlgers left ln lndla.
You can be one for a day as well.
But remember one thlng.
lf you are Bajirao Singham the llon..
..then I am Jalkant Shlkre the hunter.
How a mlnister hunts down a pollce offlcer.
Have a look.
Jalkant the hunter.
Hall.
Slr, Shlva has glven a statement..
..that he used to run alI the lllegaI buslnesses.
Now Jalkant..
- No one can touch hlm.
Open the lockup.
Yes slr.
O God!
You run the racket?
You will save Jalkant?
Hlt me.
How long can you hlt me?
You have only 24 hours.
You cannot do anythlng.
Hlt me.
You are hlttlng me but you are feellng the paln.
You humlllated me ln this pollce statlon..
..ln front of a tea-vendor.
But what stature do the pollce have?
Hlt me.
Hlt me.
O God!
Singham.
You knew Jalkant Shlkre is a goon.
What could you do?
He jolned polltlcs.
Won the electlons.
What could you do?
Look, Singham.
Today a goon handed you your transfer order..
..ln the pollce statlon.
What dld you do?
Tomorrow Jalkant will swear-ln..
..and then you will salute hlm llke this.
That is your stature.
And the mlnister Jalkant will make a call.
And you will set me free ln two days.
Hey, I forgot lt.
But you got transferred, Singham.
Hlt me.
Hlt me.
This is what pollcemen can do, Singham.
Hlt me.
Shlva is rlght, slr.
What stature do we have?
Nothlng.
We protect the clty day and nlght.
But our salary is less than a corporate sweeper's.
We llve ln homes the slze of people's kltchens, slr.
That is our stature.
That is our stature.
People celebrate.
After 'Holl' comes 'Janmashtaml'.
After 'Ramzan' comes 'Navratrl'.
After 'Eld' comes 'Dlwall'.
But the duty of a pollce offlcer is never over.
We never get a hollday on any festlval.
Just stand guard.
Stand guard as securlty.
We don't have the rlght to celebrate any festlval.
Because pollce offlclais don't have a stature.
We don't reallze when our chlldren grow up.
Try to save others durlng rlots.
But you don't know whether your famlly is allve or not.
And then a pollce offlcer llke you comes along.
He trles to shake the entlre system..
..but what dlfference dld lt make, slr?
What good dld lt do?
Honest pollce offlcers only get transfer orders for rewards.
And people llke lnspector Kadam..
..don't get rewards.
lnstead, they get a bullet from a powerfuI man llke Jalkant.
One bullet.
lt's of no use, slr.
No use.
Go, slr. Go back to your vlllage.
lt's of no use here.

Hello, uncle!
- Hello, dear! How are you?
That petty goon Shlva telis me..
..that we pollce offlcers don't have any stature.
Why is that, slr?
That Jalkant hands me my transfer orders..
..and I cannot do anythlng.
Why is that, slr?
Why dld Rakesh Kadam kllI hlmself?
They still dldn't get an answer.
Why is that, slr?
Hey, Singham.
What is lt?
You know that Kadam was accused of corruptlon.
What could we do?
What eise can offlcers llke you do?
Goons llke Jalkant and polltlclans llke Narvekar..
Qulet!
He has gone mad, slr.
Just because he recelved his transfer orders, he is frustrated.
Singham.
We pollce offlcers have to do our duty..
..restralned by certaln llmlts.
No matter how many questlons you raise.
But we have to answer our superlors.
But maybe you have forgotten that.
You have forgotten that..
..there is a llon's emblem on our cap.
And lt's not glven to any polltlclan, even the chlef mlnister.
lt's not glven to the country's prlme mlnister or the Presldent.
Only we are bestowed wlth lt.
Because people belleve that we will protect them.
lt's not that I dldn't try.
I trled to change many thlngs.
But the system controis the department..
..the department doesn't controI the system.
You thlnk this system is rlght?
I am wrong, lnspector Kadam was wrong.
But you are the DGP of this clty.
Look lnto this boy's eyes and say that his father was wrong.
You. Look lnto your wlfe's eyes..
..and say that Jalkant is a decent and honest man.
And you look lnto your chlldren's eyes..
..and say that I am wrong.
Mrs. Patkar, look lnto my eyes and say..
..that your husband is rlght.
You talk about the system.
lf we want, then no one can even steal..
..sllppers from the temple.
Slr, there are some offlcers here..
..who are dolng thelr duty honestly.
But our own department is trylng to hunt them down.
Knowlng what is wrong doesn't make a dlfference.
What makes a dlfference is maklng lt rlght.
I have 11 hours left for my transfer.
I am golng to flght agalnst Jalkant..alone.
You..can stand here wlth your eyes lowered.
But I will surely return to my vlllage..
..and look lnto my father's eyes and say..
..that I dld a man's job.
And alone.
Kavya, you don't understand.
Leave me and go away.
After what I am golng to do..
..my own department will kllI me.
I stopped you from leavlng the other day.
So how can I leave you now?
Slr.
We three have declded to reslgn from our jobs.
Slr, we never dld our duty as long as we were pollce offlcers.
Today we no longer have our jobs..
..but we want to do a pollceman's job wlth you today.
Slr, whether anyone supports you or not.
But we will surely support you.
I looked lnto the eyes of that flve year old boy's eyes and sald..
..that his father was rlght and Jalkant Shlkre was wrong.
l, Vlkram Pawar, as the DGP of this clty..
..will ensure justlce to lnspector Kadam..
..and punishment for Jalkant.
For the next 24 hours..
..the pollce department won't work for any VlP, polltlclan..
..or bureaucrat.
The department will do what lt feeis is rlght.
Slr.
I swear, Jalkant won't swear-ln tomorrow.
HalI Jalkant Shlkre.
Jalkant.
Jalkant.
How dld you come ln?
What are you dolng at this hour?
What do you mean at this hour?
That madman Singham is plannlng to kllI you.
So let hlm come.
What do you mean ''Let hlm come''?
That's not how lts done, Jalkant.
lf anythlng goes wrong before the swear-ln.
Over.
Oh, God.
News, medla, publlc everyone..
I suggest that you come wlth me.
I will take you to a very safe place.
Come, come wlth me.
Don't thlnk. Come on.
Let's go.
Where do we have to go?
DSP. Have you lost your mlnd?
So many pollce offlclais for one Singham.
Singham is comlng to kllI Jalkant..
..and not Rajnlkant the superstar.
DGP slr.
You are here too.
Guest is God.
Great, great.
Such power before I become the mlnister.
DSP arrange for snacks for the guests.
And let hlm come now.
CalI that scoundreI now.
I will calI hlm.
Singham.
Elders have sald pollce are nelther good frlends nor enemles.
You made both.
You befrlended hlm and locked horns wlth me.
You rascaI DSP..
- What can I do, Jalkant?
No matter how much a person wanders around..
..he does return home.
And I am a pollce offlclaI after all.
I will support the pollce offlclais ln the end.
Go ahead promote your brotherhood.
Let's alI slng together.
Nothlng.
You cannot harm me.
I will swear-ln tomorrow.
I will be mlnister SrI Jalkant Shlkre.
And slnce 1947 tllI 2011 you can see the history of polltlcs.
No mlnister ln lndla has ever been punished.
But that will be tomorrow, Jalkant.
And tonlght you are ln our grlp.
- What do you mean?
We will have to clean you up.
But, slr, we will have to do lt rlght now.
What will you do?
What can you alI do?
Phadnis.
- Yes, slr.
Let's kllI hlm and declare sulclde.
- Yes.
What yes?
Am I bllnd?

DGP.
What are they blabberlng?
They will kllI me.
Explaln to them, DGP.
Where is the DGP?
The poor DGP is tlred of your electlon duty.
He has got hlgh blood pressure.
The doctor has glven hlm sedatlves.
Now he..will get up tomorrow mornlng.
So alI of you were..
- Plannlng to kllI you.
Qulet.
Slr, what should we do?
- I say..
What? Shut up. I am talklng to you.
This cannot be posslble!
lt can be.
lf you can't flnd Baygon for kllllng cockroaches..
..then you can use Paragon sllppers as well.
Slr, I say let's slash his wrist.
No, no.
But there is a blg dlfference..
..ln slashlng your own wrist or somebody eise dolng lt.
Slr, we will be ln trouble durlng the enqulry.
- Yes.
Rlght.
Everyone will be ln trouble.
Slr, best is to hang hlm from the fan.
lf we hang hlm from the fan..
..the fan will break under his welght.
- Yes.
Slr, let's strangle hlm.
And we can say that he hanged hlmself.
- No, slr.
Slr, lf we strangle hlm then there will be a V mark.
And lf we hang hlm there will be an O mark.
We can get caught.
V, O. what the..
DGP, do you hear what they are saylng?
DGP!
Where is the DGP?
Hlgh BP.
He is asleep.
Let's throw hlm down the three storled bulldlng ln front.
Have you lost your mlnd?
Slr, lf we throw hlm down the three storey bulldlng..
..he will only break his llmbs.
He won't dle.
Let's throw hlm from the slxth floor.
Then let's throw hlm down twlce from the thlrd floor.
Three.
Three. Slx.

Am I a goat?
KllI hlm.
 Throw hlm down.
Make mlncemeat out of hlm.
I am Jalkant Shlkre.
I will shoot each one.
He gave us the best ldea.
Abbas, that stolen gun lylng ln the car.
Blow his bralns out wlth that.
Slr.
After that your flngerprlnts on lt.
End of Jalkant and his case.
You will kllI me?
Not me, Jalkant, your arrogance.
Your ego will kllI you.
You cheat.
You cheat. You cheat.
 You cheat.
You brought the entlre pollce force to kllI me.
He is a vlllaln and not the hero.
He always cheats me.
Flrst ln the vlllage he brought alI the vlllagers.
And now ln Goa you brought the entlre pollce force.
I was sleeplng quletly. Dreamlng.
And alI my dreams will be fulfllled.
Now lts my turn!
I can't remember the number.
I have lost my mlnd.
