Ready.
I am V.R. Krishna lyer,
that's my name.
I was a lawyer, later a Minister,
after that I was a Judge.
Now I am 88 years old.
Based on my experience,
I strongly support abolishing
the capital punishment.
This is not my personal view.
From time immemorial it has
been a part of our tradition.
Gandhi also used to say,
God has given this life,
only God has the right to take it.
Neither court nor the state has
any right on it.
Kindly note that death penalty
is another kind of,
judicially sanctioned murder.
Thank you.
My name is Munuswamy.
I have hanged 46 people till date.
- Do you feel guilty?
What?
Do you feel guilty of taking
so many lives?
Initially I had guilty feeling,
but now it has become
my profession.
I don't that feeling now.
This is special Manila rope noose.
Every time we change this.
As the face is covered
by a black mask.
Protruding of the tongue & popping out
of the eyes are not seen.
There is no need for
the witnesses to see them.
Marappan. - Death penalty.
I was a head master of a
school for 30 years.
One day some boys came & told me
that few boys were creating trouble.
When I went to check, I learnt that
the trouble maker was correspondent's son.
I warned him to stop,
but he didn't.
I beat him and he fell down dead.
I'm not obsessed of that sin.
God has destined me to do that.
Regretting the incident I went
home to commit suicide.
My wife said, "A teacher mustn't
set a bad precedent".
So, I went to the police station
and surrendered.
Later, they made me go from
pillar to post in courts,
Now, I am in the death row.
A mercy petition was filed, but
I don't know what happened to it.
I am now hanging, without a noose,
between life & death.
On the whole we arrange
a decent death for criminals.
I don't know what is decent
about this death.
If this is judgement and
this is justice,
I would hang myself.
My name is Angela Kathamuthu.
I am now in central prison.
I am involved in a research about
the validity of capital punishment.
We are abiding by the law,
not in the interest of this society,
but more out of fear of
the punishment, that is true.
To protect society & law,
there is an opinion which
says punishment in necessary.
There is another opinion which says
law has too many loop holes.
Like men, law too has
committed many mistakes.
There are many evidences
in the history.
Many times law has magnanimously
re-written it's judgements.
But there's one judgement which even
the law can't re-write.
That is death penalty.
Go inside.
My name is Peikaman.
I took examination in 2000 and
came here as Sub-jailer on promotion.
What's the problem, man?
- There's no screw in the door.
One minute.
Come with me man.
- I think today our given time is over.
We've got permission tomorrow also.
We'll come & take interviews.
We've come here with permission.
No problem... is camera running.
Switch it on quickly.
I'll finish it before
he comes back.
Narayanan, death penalty.
Anyway I am going to die, I will
tell you everything before that.
Too many irregularities are
happening in this jail.
Atrocities of Peikaman are unbearable.
Everything bad is happening here.
Cell phones, drugs are going
around the jail.
Jailer is a good man,
but this Peikaman is...
Any problem?
Did he say anything?
Prisoners in death row
are very moody people.
They'll laugh, cry and
whatever they say are lies.
You could've asked me.
Mr. Cameraman. - Sir.
You have left your lens cap here.
Thank you.
Will they telecast it bravely?
They'll not develop cold feet, will they?
Why? Definitely not.
We must be afraid only if
they are Government servants.
Tomorrow, I will come prepared
with 4 or 5 extra tapes.
What if a few more
Narayanan's talk to you.
Girish, you also deserve to be
in a jail. - Of course.
Do you know I was very nervous.
Madam, you've done doctorate
only in civil law.
I've done doctorate in cheating.
Watch me tomorrow.
Shall we add this shot or...?
Keep it inside as important.
Let's think about it later.
No need to invite trouble now.
Let's see what is in this jeep.
I am not able to recognize
who is in there.
Move... move.
Move away.
Bloody rascal! What do you think of
yourself? I will wipe all of you.
Shut up. Don't shout.
Inform Angela has come to
meet the Jailer.
They have come to meet the Jailer.
I want to clean up the whole mess
during my tenure here.
For that I want...
- Sir, that lady interviewer...
Ask her to come in.
Giving a ready made
explanation for everything.
Hello, good morning.
Morning, madam.
Please take your seat.
Any how it's not a good morning
for me, it's very bad.
Why?
Prisoners are fasting inside
and outside trouble & commotion.
Brother, please don't take out.
- Okay. - Leave it.
Any small issue is enough for them
...this time it's a death.
Our heads will roll if anyone
dies in our custody.
Okay, forget about it.
You will complete your interviews
today, won't you?
Please finish them. Don't take them at in
yesterday's place.
It's very sensitive.
I have allotted this block.
It will be convenient for you.
Try to finish it today
so that it will be...
Yes, just 2-3 interviews
are pending. - Okay.
We left an interview half way yesterday.
We've to continue it.
Okay. Who was he?
Was it teacher Marappa Gounder?
- No... no...
I think he was Narayanan.
Death sentence prisoner? - Yeah.
Any problem? - Nothing.
Please wait outside.
This place is in chaos.
We need help from committed
people like you.
Okay.
You can't interview Narayanan.
- Why?
He fell ill yesterday and died
on the way to the hospital.
Don't kill the prisoners...
Prisoners here are suspicious
about his death.
You can hear them, can't you?
Sir, his relatives have come
to claim the body.
Wait, I will come after
few minutes.
Narayanan was more dangerous
compared to other rowdies.
One minute.
A lady is coming, isn't it?
Open the main gate.
You come in madam.
For a rowdy's death,
They are resorting to fasting
as if he was a Mahatma.
Jailer is a good man.
That isn't enough here.
You need an iron fist.
IPS Officers will never have it.
Only officers like me who come
from the cadre, have it.
Or else... they will resort
to fasting like this.
Sir, I didn't commit anything wrong.
- Wait, I will come.
You come madam.
I think you are upset because you are
unable to interview Narayanan.
Oh no.
Don't worry, there is another
more interesting case than him.
The people we are going to meet now,
both of them together have massacred
24 people in Theni District.
They then tried to kill each other.
Now both of them are in jail.
One is going to gallows.
One is serving a life term.
You would have heard
about Virumaandi case.
I had investigated that case.
We are now going to meet second
accused, Virumaandi's sworn enemy.
Kothaala Thevar.
C. K... Chinnakolarpatti,
Theni District.
Life.
...Life term.
Tell me further.
Direct descendants of Sundara Pandi Thevar
who ruled before Thirumalai Naicker,
No, talk in your normal way.
I don't want your old history.
Don't you? - No.
Tell me your opinion
about death penalty.
Death penalty is a must.
I don't mind 10 innocents
like me dying,
but, blood thirsty criminals shouldn't
have a free run in the country.
But law insists that let 10 criminals escape
but not one innocent should be punished.
That is why we respect natural justice
and fate more than law.
According to justice, if he should die,
that's his fate.
That is what law also says.
What do you understand from this?
There is God.
Who the law is insisting to die?
- That man!
That's the point, who is he?
Virumaandi.
Did you see? It's difficult even
to utter his name.
Appearances are deceptive.
I may appear like a villain,
but actually he is the real villain.
He instigated people of 2
villages to fight & die.
Which 2 villages?
C.K. Patti... Chinnakolarpatti and
Nallama Naickenur.
Beautiful villages.
It was 'Jallikattu'(Taming of bull) in
Nallama Naickenur that year.
Nallama Naicker had killed my father.
He spent 4 years in jail for that.
Everyone in this village knows it.
We don't have cordial relationship.
Despite this, in the interest of
the village, forgetting the past,
I make it a point to attend
such public functions,
like a peace loving dove.
Ladies & gentlemen, who have come
here to attend this festival,
young courageous men,
affectionate young man,
taming of the bull is about
to start. All of you be ready.
Temple bull is coming up first.
If you want good to happen,
don't touch it.
There the temple bull is coming.
Offer prayers to it.
Temple bull is coming first.
It's coming, give way to it.
Temple bull is coming.
Temple bull is coming.
Don't touch it, if you touch it,
you are finished.
Holy motherl
Offer camphor.
Hey, move man.
Don't touch it.
Worship the bull and
stay away from it.
Apply little sandalwood paste.
- Hey, don't fall on me man.
Bull is coming...
Give way to the bull.
Let it go...
Temple bull is coming...
Listen to me. Don't try to tame it.
Next one will be
Nallama Naicker's bull.
Do you know it's name? Veerapandi.
Bull from Nallama Naickenur.
Everybody listen carefully.
Don't make noise.
Hey, go & tell them.
Go & tell your people not to tame bulls
from their native village.
Natives shouldn't tame it.
Do you know the name? Veerapandi.
Who is Veerapandi? Is there any man
here to tame this bull?
Do you know who is Veerapandi?
He Legendary Veerapandi Kattabomman.
Skies provide rain, earth produces.
Why should we pay you tax?
This bull comes from a place that
belonged to the great warrior.
If you consider yourself a man,
stand before it.
Hey, stand away...
don't touch it's tail.
If you consider yourself a man,
stand before it.
Hey, watch it... Catch it.
... Pin it down.
Don't leave it's tail.
Hey, look there, they are pinning
down our bull... - Our bull...
Someone please come & save it.
- Pin it down.
It's Veerapandi, isn't it?
That's why they could pin it.
Naicker is looking at us.
What's this? Your bull got
tamed so easily.
Bull isn't well.
- It seems bull isn't well.
What's the problem with the bull?
Why are you announcing it?
It's fine.
It seems bull is fine.
Move... move.
You have tamed it, haven't you?
They'll give the money. Go & get it.
Hey, was money our only aim?
Are we doing it for money?
Taming the bull is game of valour.
Great warrior! Hey, why are you
biting the tail?
After biting sheep & cattle,
will you bite humans next?
Why are they still pinning the bull down?
Tell them to leave it.
Who had tamed the bull?
Come & collect the prize money.
Don't make noise.
Shall we give it sir?
Take it. Sit down... sit down.
There's a watch also.
Will you give watch also sir?
There's watch also. Sit down... Looks
like they will remove my 'Dhothi' also.
Release it... release it.
Heroes who have come to
tame the bull.
The bull you have been eagerly
waiting for is coming up now.
What is the name of bull?
Sorimuthu reared by Annalakshmi.
Annamuthu brought up by Sorilakshmi.
Hey, don't make noise...
They will hack you all.
It belongs to Annalakshmi, daughter of
Kothaala Thevar's late elder brother.
Why is he announcing my name?
He should be announcing bull's name.
Listen one thing... be careful,
all of you be ready.
It is no ordinary bull.
It had butted down 50 people
in Alanganallur 'Jallikattu'.
It struck people at the gate itself.
- Hey, move...
In another place it injured many people.
Now, it has come here.
Men who dare can tame it or
else go & sleep safely at home.
Heroes who have come to tame bulls
listen carefully.
No native of Chinnakolarpatti
must attempt to tame it.
That is the condition.
A condition to be followed strictly.
- Hey... move man.
No one must defy it.
- Hey, don't touch it.
A bull brought up by Annalakshmi.
If any stranger nears it, it'll rip him
apart like Annalakshmi, be careful.
Courageous men, brave men.
- Don't know who's going to be ripped apart?
Get on to the platform.
Because the bull will tear
you apart, be careful.
Bull is coming.
Run to safety.
Bull is coming charging.
Look back... turn back.
You are going to get kicked by it.
Look there, don't stand in a corner,
you'll get kicked to death.
Please listen to me. That's it, throw them,
only then they will realize.
That's it, pin them down.
Yes, come aside...
it's attacking... turn.
Listen... catch it, don't leave.
If you throw dust into it's eyes,
I will kill you.
It's attacking. Clear away.
Why do you come to tame the bull
if you're afraid of death? Stay out.
Hey, don't go inside.
Hold this.
Hey Sorimuthu... go out... go out.
There are cows in the house.
Hey, chase them out.
It must live.
Why are you embarrassing me?
- Go out.
Chase it out. Competitors are waiting,
aren't they? - Go out.
Chinnakolarpatti people shouldn't
tame it. Listen to me.
Why shouldn't we? We will tame it.
Tell us the reason.
Once I say no, I mean it.
People from your village
shouldn't tame it.
Can an outsider tame it, then?
- Outsider? Who is that?
Our Singapore brother-in-law.
He's grandson of Kupputhai.
Don't you know?
Oh! Singapore brother-in-law!
Kupputhai's grandson.
- Who's he?
He went to Singapore to do cloth business.
- Say that away from the microphone.
Singapore brother-in-law
will tame the bull.
Tame it, let us see.
Virumaandi come down.
Virumaandi, my dear son
tame the bull.
Come... come down.
May I? - Come.
He's Prince in taming bulls.
Enemies don't come down from skies.
We create them ourselves.
It's rumoured that Virumaandi's father
and Nallama Naicker killed my father.
We didn't take the rumour seriously.
Catch it.
Move... move... move... - Come.
- Be careful.
Be careful brother, it's coming.
Don't leave it. Pin it down.
Don't leave it. Be careful.
Virumaandi brother, don't leave it.
Are you hurt? - No.
Release Sorimuthu from them.
You said Singapore man will tame it,
but all have joined to pin it down.
Hey move... get up from it.
- Where's he?
Do you accept?
He has accepted. Leave it.
Leave me.
Drink this... drink.
Drink...
It is burning. Is it good stuff?
- Be careful.
AYNGARAN DVD
Sporting flowers around the horns.
Sporting a dot on the forehead.
A bull brought up by a maiden,

Come on your moped &

flag of victory for the hero.
AYNGARAN DVD
Come & count the wounds
of valour on my chest.
In one & two's...
Bulls which roamed untamed are now
cooling heels in cattle sheds.
Shall I unsheathe the sword
from the scabbard on my hip?
Shall I show you the
identity of devastation?
You would have understood my power.
Your bull will come to
scratch my back.
I am not a bull to wag it's tail
at the sight of a woman.
I will mind my own business.
Hey, Stop! Reckless man!
Can't you hear me calling you?
My mother has fondly named
me Virumaandi.
Will I respond if you
call me something else?
Whatever you may call yourself,
world calls you a reckless man.
What did Nallama Naicker say?
It seems he had sent a message.
What did he ask you?
He asked me if I am
interested to sell my lands.
What was your reply? - I told him that
I'm going to talk to you.
I am asking
what was your reply?
In this entire area only my well
has water at 20 feet.
I told him respectfully.
I will not sell.
Goto hell man. I am asking about the land.
Where are you going?
- We are going to Theni.
Who told you we are going to Theni?
Brother, you only.
No, we are going else where.
You go there.
What's this?
Go fast... go fast.
Go fast... go fast.
Is the road his father's property?
Tell him to remove it.
- Sir, it's Kuppatha's cart.
Hey, what is that nonsense?
Remove it.
Go... go.
Virumaandi came home drunk and
asked to feed all his friends.
He poured a bucket of water on the
sleeping old woman.
She died.
Fun turned into a disaster.
Go man. - What happened man?
What?
Hey, come here.
What happened?
Mother was sleeping.
Brother woke her up and
poured water on her face.
When he touched her she was dead.
- Did he pour water?
There is no use in making a hue & cry.
A life is lost forever.
Oh great soul, have you
left this world?
AYNGARAN DVD
Why you are so late?
I had been out of station.
I am coming just now.
Give me my 'Dhothi'.
Have you gone away leaving all your
kith & kin without telling anyone?
You came from the sky.
Have you gone back to the sky?
Oh my dear, I am devastated
with your death.
I am speechless with sorrow.
Virumaandi owns the last bit of
land on the bank of the river.
Nallama Naickenur is
on the other bank.
If we own it, we can fish and
impound water from this side.
I expected Nallama Naicker will usurp
the lands after the death of Kupputhai.
Sit down... sit down.
- It happened.
Enough of drinking Virumaandi.
Do you also want to die?
There is no one to look
after you hereafter.
Stop roaming around with
these useless men.
Try to earn something,
marry a girl.
No, I and my uncle...
- Uncle! - Yes.
We are going to do agriculture.
Is it enough?
Wife & children?
No, if I need a woman,
I will go to a prostitute.
Is this the way to talk
to a policeman?
Today you are drunk.
- Look, a policeman has found it.
Hey one more cut.
Cut my throat,
I will go into the grave along with
my grandma as this policeman said.
Okay, leave it.
I've made all arrangement
to bury your grandma.
Whose grand mother?
- Your grandmother.
That's okay, bury your
grandmother there.
I have selected a place
for my grandmother here.
I will bury her here only.
Inside the well?
It's not our tradition.
Is your grandmother, Lord Ganesha?
Don't talk, I will bury
her on my land.
Don't talk like a mad man.
Go away, why are you following us?
Hey, you can shave his head later.
Hey, be careful, it's a well.
Don't I know my well? Who are you?
- Okay, you know it well.
Nallama Naicker will pay a
good price for your lands.
If you bury your grandma there,
it will lose value.
Will you arrest me if
I bury my grandma here?
Will police dare to arrest me?
Talk in low voice.
It's between us only.
I will not arrest you.
I said your lands
will lose value.
I have high regard
for my grandma.
I have no regard for
anyone or anything else.
I don't care if it is Nallama Naicker
or Kothaala Thevar.
They are all here only.
Uncle, come here.
I and my uncle are going to do
agriculture on all my lands.
Are you going to do agriculture?
Me? No way. All I have to do
is go to a doctor.
Madam, please come, brother is
creating a scene there.
He will listen to you only.
You have made him to get drunk and
now you complain he's creating a scene.
Why are you killing me?
Come man.
Look there.
Virumaandi, why are you creating
a scene after getting drunk?
Village elders have come,
please come, son.
You all worship 3 Gods.
My grandma taught me
to worship 5 Gods.
Earth, water, sky, air, fire.
We must worship all 5 Gods.
It's famine if we earn the
wrath of any one God.
Upper pod is for home,
middle stem is for cattle.
Roots are for earth,
only when they spread inside,
look, water at 15 feet
for that reason only.
Wealthy people have sucked up
all water like blood sucking devils.
It has made others to use 250 feet
deep bore wells to suck out water.
No son, don't talk disrespectfully
about others.
Okay, I will not talk in front of you.
- Oh my dear son.
Elderly people, forgive me, I didn't
mean to disrespect you.
I will do agriculture here only,
get lost. - Go away.
Brother, water is oozing out from
the grave dug for grandma.
Water... did you see this?
Village elders come here.
Come here.
I have called village elders,
why are you coming, uncle?
There is no such elder
in our house.
Please come here.
My grandma is Goddess.
It's offering of God. - Listen to me.
You must perform her last rites.
If you get drunk & create a scene.
- Virumaandi... please stop son.
You can see it later, please come.
Come, I say.
Did you see?
This isn't water.
This is my grandma's blood.
This land has been developed with
the blood of my grandma.
This is not land.
This is my grandmother's land.
Are you trying to
put a price for it?
This is not for sale.
This is my grandma's body.
I will never give it to you.
Don't talk like this.
Go away. Why are you
staring at me?
Go away... go away.
- Please come sir.
Bloody policeman.
This is my grandma's body.
Go away.
My grandma's body.
Who's that? Leave me... leave me.
You don't tie the garlands.
Enemity with Nallama Naicker
isn't good for us.
He's good for namesake only.
He is like a king cobra.
Even if Naicker leaves him,
he will drink to his death.
That will be good.
His land will become heirless.
But, village council is there in
Nallama Naickenur, isn't it?
Will Nallama Naicker spare it?
Won't you hand over the land on a platter
to Nallama Naicker by hook or crook?
Brother.
- Didn't you speak to him?
I was speaking to him about something
else. - I know you very well.
You were a chameleon from
our school days.
Brother, my police station is
in Nallama Naickenur.
But, my heart is in Chinnakolarpatti.
Thevar sir, ask me anything you want.
Betraying my caste people,
will I become a broker to Naicker?
I will take him to task.
- What can you do?
By now, Nallama Naicker would have
fixed a time & rung the bell.
AYNGARAN DVD
Lord Aandiyappa who rules

Vilvanathan, sister Pechiamma &
Peikaman all are within you.

AYNGARAN DVD
The sound of your bell
has been heard.
Lord of this dark age(Kaliyugam)
Please, come out.
As we had vowed on the auspicious
Friday of Tamil month Adi.
Lord, please come out to
accept our offerings.
Virumaandi who had
subdued Peikaman.
Pechiamma is calling you.
Entire community is waiting
with offerings.
Come & save our faith.
AYNGARAN DVD
A god given to us
by our ancestors.
It's a sin to subdue you
by the beat of the drum.
If the dead demon Kaman
comes back alive.
Where are we to go?
Who is here other than you
to save poor people?
Sins committed by sons,
Goddess will be merciful and pardon them.
Prove yourself to be the
omnipotent & omnipresent god.
Pechiamma once appeared like goddess
Kali in a Karmathur forest. - Go & check.
She Offered vegetarian offerings,
prepared in a mud pot.
What is that?
What happened?
What's this blood?
What happened?
They attacked Virumaandi.
I had expected this when
Nallama Naicker turned into his enemy.
Yes sir, they were Naicker's men only.
I couldn't see them
clearly in the darkness.
Even Nallama Naicker was
there with a sickle.
Mad man, you are accusing a village
elder without seeing him clearly.
You just now saw them, didn't you?
Do you want us to fight and
go for each other's neck?
Go man... take him away from here.
Hey, take him to a hospital.
Come... come... quickly.
This side... this side only
...here only.
Who is that? - Hey, keep quiet.
Sir!
...come here.
Hey, who is that?
I am asking, who is that?
What happened?
- Don't venture out.
Trouble has erupted between
Virumaandi & Nallama Naicker.
Hey, no one must venture out.
Don't allow children to go out.
Don't peep out.
Hey, close the door quickly.
Move man. - Hey come,
let's go with him.
Move man...
No one should get into the vehicle.
Sir, the sickle used to
kill him is missing.
It is an evidence.
Is sickle more important now?
It is all god's grace.
If he had died that day,
I wouldn't have ended up in jail.
We can't foresee our future, can we?
I prayed to God with utmost devotion
to save his life.
He came back after spending
2 months in hospital.
Did he leave me after that?
No, he came to me as soon as
he got out of the hospital.
Hey, door has opened.
Hey, you all stay here only.
Sir has asked only you to come in.
It will go for the tank only.
Hey, what?
Come Virumaandi.
Greetings sir.
Are you fine?
You are the right man to ask that.
Greetings.
You carry on.
It's god grace.
Do you understand?
What are you looking at?
You refused to sell your lands.
I can't beg from anyone.
Whether it is 200 or 300 feet,
it will be my house, my well.
I will get water.
You will not get water.
Take your hands off me.
Leave it man, spoiling my dress.
Why will you not laugh?
You would have known, if you were dead.
If I had died, I wouldn't
have known anything.
Now, you will make fun
and taunt others.
I and Nallama Naicker,
both had asked you.
Did you see its result?
I am digging a well and
he has attacked you.
This is the difference between
a gentleman & a rogue.
Hey, take it inside, making noise!
We are in a discussion, aren't we?
It seems you didn't tell
anyone's name to the Police.
I'm asking you, ain't I?
I was drunk, so I couldn't
recognize the killer.
Entire village claims to have seen
and you say you didn't see him.
You lodge a complaint
against Nallama Naicker.
I will manage the rest of the show.
Nallama Naicker's men will come
to buy your lands. - Yes... yes...
Don't sell to them,
lands are yours, got it?
Are you going to use a razor?
It's summer time, it will burn.
No, it will be irritating.
Apply powder, it's summer time.
Where did I leave it?
Powder is under your arms.
Hey, keep quiet man.
Where? - Lands...
Sell your lands and
settle down in Madras.
You were in Singapore.
This place will not suit you.
Do you get me?
What are you saying?
You don't know what brought me here.
I am indebted to your entire family.
Money is no problem to me.
I have Rs.10 lakhs staked in the bank.
They are paying me interest
every month.
I came here to tell you that
all my lands & water is yours...
You are asking me to go away.
I want to become your partner.
My partner?
Why? - Asking me why?
Annalakshmi saved my life.
Annalakshmi had packed me
in coconut leaf mat,
and sent me to
the police station safely.
What is it uncle? (Paternal uncle).
This is not for you.
Is it true? - What?
Go away from here.
Give this to that big dog.
I am asking you, am I not?
- What?
This one.
Didn't you tell them?
Whether it is a donkey, a pup or a man.
Can I watch them die?
That dog will not bite.
Don't make noise.
You said it will not bite,
but it has bitten him.
Hey, move away. - Why are you
playing the fool here? Go away.
What's that noise?
Did you switch on the Pump Motor?
Oh Honey beesl
Gone! They had disturbed
the honey comb.
Brother, tie it in the cattle shed.
Do you have a match box?
Take it.
Excuse me...
Will you please untie that dog?
Will you give me a 'Beedi' please?
- Take it.
Why are you making so much
fuss for few honey bees?
Oh, they are stinging.
Hold it...
they won't harm anyone.
What is this, you have
untied the bull?
How much time will you
spend in water?
Catch her... catch her.
Sorimuthu, don't go away.
I will beat you.
Uncle, don't over-react.
Brother, Virumaandi & Annalakshmi
are coming back.
They has stung me also,
a wealthy & a powerful man.
Why is your face swollen?
Annalakshmi is an innocent girl.
Young agel
Don't know what made her
to get close to him.
A man who tames raging bulls,
has talked his way to trap her.
I should have cut the budding
relationship then itself. I missed the chance.
Serve...
Serve some more.
Don't know where all the food
is getting deposited?
Hey, don't make fun of a man
who eats without inhibition.
I am not making fun of anyone.
He is eating which I generally
cook for 5 people.
Hey Annalakshmi, keep quiet.
- Let her say, she's telling the truth.
Your food intake depends
on the cook.
Dear, you scold but
don't stop cooking for me.
Oh, won't you wash your
hands before eating?
Roaming in filthy areas,
you are ready to eat straightaway!
Get up! Wash your hands.
I have washed my hands, haven't I?
Whatever it is,
she'll not relent.
Go & wash your hands.
We are hungry... go.
Quickly.
Aunt, serve here.
He is not feeling well,
he will not eat much.
Pour.
I think you are a cannibal.
You have blinded both my eyes.
Yuck... uncle, my eyes...
Go away. Wash your hands again.
He's a sweet talker.
I too got charmed with his talk
and made him my partner.
Annalakshmi fell into his trap
like a fly in a cobweb.
On the Eastern bank,
Your parents are lying
dead...
if you go there,
they will spread their wings,
Are you going there?
We are searching them and
they are roaming here.
They say after going for sheep & cattle,
they will come for humans.
Like that, he manipulated
to get close to me.
I ignored it for the sake of Annalakshmi...
When I asked, "What will society
say about this affair?"
He got drunk and
came to kill me.
Have you gone mad?
You keep quiet, let him talk.
If you talk disrespectfully,
I will not spare you.
Leave him.
Dear!
Oh no! Please leave him.
If I had killed him that day,
24 people wouldn't
have lost their lives unnecessarily.
Annalakshmi & my wife took up
cudgels on his behalf.
He still had few years to live,
so he survived that day.
Hey, leave me.
If you do wrong & seek forgiveness,
will the wrong become right?
I was a mad man.
I loved my brother's
daughter very much.
So, I took him under my wings again.
Let the case get solved.
...you and Virumaan...
You and Annalakshmi are getting married.
This is my decision.
I will announce this in
tomorrow's council meeting also.
Tomorrow we are going to council
meeting at Nallama Naickenur.
No one will dare to touch you.
I will protect you.
Me? Get scared?
I knocked down Chinese men
also in Singapore.
Anyone with Chinese eyes is
not a Bruce Lee.
Nallama Naicker has called
for a council meeting.
You are saying as if Tirumalai Naicker
has called a meeting.
Hey, stop it boys.
My son Peddarasu
is attending the court everyday,
because he is an advocate.
I went to court 18 years ago.
If your father had been alive,
he would've told you.
You see Kothaala Thevar sitting there.
I tried for a compromise between your
father & his father Thavasi Thevar,
but it ended in a big fight.
Thavasi Thevar was the first to take
out the sickle, I killed him.
When I came back from
jail after 4 years,
I made a vow never to touch weapon
or step into a court again.
I am still following it.
That's why, people have accepted
me as their leader.
Because of that vow you and
Kothaala Thevar are still alive.
Oh! If you say I am still alive
because of your mercy,
and my life is like the night soil,
I don't want it.
Come, let's settle it personally.
Is any one ready?
Don't throw challenges and...
Hey, my son will not touch
a weapon, if he does,
my son who had saved your
father will kill you.
Mother keep quiet.
Have you gone mad?
Don't incite people here
with your theatrics.
It's just a false case,
so withdraw your complaint.
Which case are you saying is false?
You tried to buy my lands,
I refused to sell.
You tried to kill me.
Hey, keep quiet.
Weapon as well as my mouth,
both will do the talking.
I am telling here, listen carefully.
- Go ahead son-in-law.
Even if you offer millions,
I will not sell my lands.
Look, Coimbatore Kondarasu
is sitting there.
Even his wells have plenty of water.
If you are so thirsty, why don't
you quench it from his wells?
He will sell anything.
Are you insinuating that I am ready
to sell anything?
The Poker faced Kothaala Thevar
who is sitting behind you,
will sell anything.
You will lose your honour.
Don't make a witness an enemy.
Kothaala, if you have guts,
fight directly.
Why are you attacking hiding
behind Virumaandi?
This is a council of gentlemen.
Hey, why are you talking to him?
I had lodged the complaint.
Talk to me.
What do you say
this is a council of gentlemen?
I am also a gentleman.
I am announcing in this
council meeting.
I will write off a part of the
property for public cause.
Ask Naicker also to
donate his property,
then I will accept him as a gentleman.
Hey Son-in-law, do you know
what you are talking? - Keep quiet.
You are talking about donating
for public cause.
No sweat. Will he take it with him
in the grave? He will donate.
I am announcing publicly,
a part of my land and the well which
has water at 15 feet,
I am bequeathing it to the
people of Chinnakolarpatti.
I will give it in writing,
will Naicker also do it?
What do you want him to donate?
Once upon a time when
'Zamindari' system was in vogue,
this entire village belonged to him.
He has already donated this village.
You are now speaking in anger.
You will back off when it actually
comes to writing on the paper.
For me, word given is paper and
decision is the pen.
Once said means it is a promise.
If Naicker doesn't want to donate,
forget about that.
Kondarasu, who is his sidekick,
tell him to donate the land.
You say Naicker had
donated this village.
You got it as charity.
Please return it to him.
He's thirsty for water, isn't he?
Dirty 'Dhothi' wearing landlord.
How are qualified to badmouth him?
What right do you have to
talk about him? Shut up.
If he is dirty 'Dhothi',
you are dirt.
Wait... wait... let him talk.
Are you talking about our father?
Didn't they kick you & throw you
out from Singapore?
I know everything about you.
I know every bit of you.
Great! It seems he knows
everything about me.
Okay, if you know everything about me,
I have an itch somewhere,
tell me where it is itching?
I don't know where you are
feeling the itch?
But, I know if Kothaala Thevar
feels the itch.
You are thing to scratch it with.
I know that very well.
I am not a thing,
I am a relative.
Let Naicker tell me,
I will give away my entire
property to anyone.
I will give away my property.
But, I will not discard my relatives
for property like Kothaala Thevar.
He wants your land, your well,
for that he handed over his
brother's daughter Annalakshmi.
He will hand over his wife also
for more property.
Hey Kondarasu, what is this?
- Wait, I will finish.
He says he'll give up his wife
also for other's property.
I am warning all of you.
Disperse peacefully.
I will kill you.
Put it down. Put it down.
You have a weapon.
My hands are empty.
I will rip you apart with bare hands.
I have iron hands.
Go... go...
Keep quiet.
Go... go man. Take him away.
I don't know whether it is
true or false,
but fate had decided to play with me.
At that moment,
bad times befell on me.
Hey, get in...
Sir, no one has seen it.
I took every insult in
my stride for him.
Hey, go inside...
He abused me & you. We should have
ripped him apart there itself.
Why did you stop me?
Can he accuse you of becoming a
pimp to your wife?
Shouldn't you have killed him
then & there itself?
Do you know the meaning of his words?
- Hey, keep quiet man.
He said only once and he's
painting the village red with it.
Annam is coming.
Don't tell her anything.
She will scold me for
picking up a fight.
Look, I have to get scolded
by a young girl for you.
Uncle, did you go and
create trouble there?
No, I didn't do anything.
Tell her, son-in-law.
You now say tell her, earlier you
had accused me of having a loose tongue.
Okay, your aunty...
...his wife...
Oh God! - What oh God?
Don't touch it.
Who is that?
It's Lord Rama's slipper. Ponnarasu is
going to coronate it, right?
Will you please come aside?
- Where?
Why?
Why?
I am asking you why and
you are just walking away.
Look at her anger.
I will find out & come.
You keep the sickle ready.
That man.
You wanted to sacrifice a goat,
didn't you? - Yes.
I will give you Kondarasu.
- You will do it.
You will eat that also.
Generally a man's anger must subside
after few words of wisdom.
He is like wild forest fire.
Hey Virumaandi is missing.
Hey Kottasami... hey, Achi... get up.
Pick up your weapons.
Son-in-law has gone out.
Virumaandi has gone out alone.
We must rush to save his life.
Before we could reach there.
Virumaandi started to
hack & stab people.
We had no choice but
to join the fight with him.
Hey come on boys.
Leave him sir, I will
take care of him.
Hey traitor!
Please save me.
Don't stand & watch the fun,
go & kill them.
Son-in-law!
Before I could bat my eye,
he killed Kondarasu barbarously.
Don't spare anyone...
- Come... come.
In that enraged mood he couldn't
understand my sane advice.
He pounced on me.
Before I could control him, my men
killed everyone there.
Don't spare anyone.
Kill everyone here.
Whom are you playing the fool with?
Enraged Virumaandi lost the
sense of justice & fairness.
Sir, it's infant... leave him.
Oh my child has fallen into
the well. Please save him.
Before his anger calmed down,
many people had lost their lives.
Get up. Why are you guys fighting?
He has accepted in public
that he is my relative.
Now, we can't abandon him up even
if he's a murderer, can we?
Go... go.
Go man. Has he gone mad?
- Go man.
He's beating me. - Go man.
We have come here to save you.
What the hell! Will you save my life?
Leave him, I will kill him.
Hey keep quiet.
Hey, look!
Hey, he is running. - Kill him.
Don't spare him.
Catch him... catch him.
You have helped a witness to run away.
Have you gone mad?
He's going that side.
- He's running... catch him.
I am coming.
Oh my grand son.
What did an innocent child do?
I didn't do anything.
You didn't do anything,
but some one else committed all these
murders in your name.
I am telling you,
I didn't do anything.
Wait, you have accepted you
were with us, haven't you?
Why are you denying it now?
You mustn't lie.
Leave him... listen to me...
Look, he has picked up a spade.
Look here.
Hey Virumaa... come with me,
listen to me.
Go & see what's it.
Look, police have arrived.
Oh no, don't make me a widow,
say all this later.
Virumaan is innocent.
Nothing will happen to him.
Son-in-law, I will accept the crime
to prove your innocence, then?
I...
Greetings.
Sir.
What is it, Kottasami?
- Nothing sir.
Nothing?
Ridiculous. - I have brought the witness.
Shall I inquire here
or at police station?
Let it be here only.
Go. - Come... come.
Mr. Advocate, you too go inside.
You need to talk, don't you?
Virumaandi, don't get scared.
I will take care.
Eye-witness Ramarasu has
come here trusting us.
We must protect him.
You repeat the same what had been
tutored to you. Judge is a good man.
Witness Ramarasu...
Silence please.
Order... order.
Mr. Naicker, what is this?
Tell them to keep quiet.
Hey, what is this man?
You were with Kondarasu on the day
this incident took place, weren't you?
No sir, I had gone to
Madurai on that day.
Did you go to Madurai or
Kothaala Thevar's house to collect money?
I strongly object, your honour.
What are you objecting to?
Objection sustained.
You know about Nallama Naicker trying to
buy Virumaandi's lands, don't you?
No use of shaking head. Say yes.
- Yes sir.
It ended up in a fight,
do you know that? - Yes sir.
Regarding the same issue Nallama Naicker
attacked Virumaandi,
a case pertaining to it is
pending in the same court.
Do you know it? - Yes.
- Your Honour.
Both are different cases.
The line of examination is not
at all pertinent to this case.
No, your honour. It is very
pertinent.
Thank you.
What did he say? - He said pertinent.
- He says pertinent. - Finished!
God save him.
Do you know about Naicker trying to buy
back Kondarasu's lands donated by him?
Yes sir.
Did Kondarasu sell back his
lands to Nallama Naicker?
No.
The anger which Naicker showed on
Virumaandi for refusing to sell lands,
he could have shown the same anger
on Kondarasu also, couldn't he?
Answer me.
He could have, sir.
On the complaint of Nallama Naicker,
under section 302 persons arrested are,
Virumaandi Thevar,
Kothaala Thevar, Kottasami.
Rasikalai, Chinna Karuppu,
Kodangi and others.
There is no evidence to prove that
they are the culprits.
This court absolves them of the crime
and releases them,
and I order the police to investigate
and apprehend the real culprits.
The entire village spat on him.
But, I got him exonerated from the murder
charges as he was my partner.
I didn't expect him to be loyal,
but can he betray me? Tell me?
Forget about me.
Could he betray Annalakshmi?
He did.
If he had asked me, I would've
got her married to him.
He is happy in plundering anything.
If she was from a poor family,
she would've given in to him.
Annalakshmi is from a wealthy family.
She didn't give in to his lust,
so he kidnapped her.
I had brought her up fondly.
He tortured and beat her...
He tried to enact a
drama and escape.
It didn't materialize,
justice prevailed.
I shouldn't be saying all this.
Don't show it on T.V.
Girl's matter...
No... cut it, Girish.
Are you finished? - Yes.
Come, Kothaala.
They say our life will get shorter
if we get photographed.
I escaped from the gallows and
got a life-term.
Photograph nicely.
When will it be telecast?
I will tell you. You come with me.
Hey, after locking this man
in the cell, you open his cell.
If we allow both of them to face
each other... it will be trouble.
Dangerous criminals, madam.
I have heard that you are from Thanjavur.
Are you from Tanjore?
No Keezvenmani.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Behave properly.
If you create any problem...
Got it.
Don't stare at me.
We are all a kind of weapon.
Interview.
This is going to be
shown on T.V.
Can we see what you have
recorded till now?
Why?
Not for me. He'll be executed within
2 weeks. That's why.
I'll show it to him once I complete
the shooting. - Right.
Now, if you don't mind...
Even you are related to this case.
So, if you can go out...
You can see in this.
Once I finish recording your statement,
I'll show it to you.
Now, it might distract you.
Can we start? Switch on.
Roll...
Ready.
Tell me your opinion about
death penalty.
Sorry madam.
Is everything alright?
I've posted a warden outside.
- Okay, thank you.
You had kidnapped Annalakshmi
and raped her.
After that...
Okay, leave it.
There must be a reason for everything.
What's the reason behind this?
- Can I ask you a question? - What?
Can I ask you a question? - Yes.
What is the size of your Bra?
- What?
Size...
Switch it off.
Virumaandi, I've come here
on humanitarian grounds.
I believe that death sentence is not
the right punishment for a murder.
I'm not a rich woman to do
social service to pass time.
I want death sentence
to be abolished.
So, respect my views.
Ask me some decent questions.
Answer my question.
- Look, answer her questions.
No. I can't answer your question.
- Why?
When you go to a shop to buy Bra,
won't you tell the size
to the shop keeper?
I'll tell it to a shopkeeper.
But to a rogue who had
raped a girl...
Sorry.
I won't tell a man
who had raped a girl.
Similarly, I've told
everything in the court.
I don't need to repeat all that to a
bitch who has come with a camera.
Warden... - Don't get angry.
- I meant her & not you. - Warden...
What's it, madam? - Nothing.
I understand.
What are you going to gain
if I answer such question?
This will be a lesson to some
like you, that's why.
Take your camera & get lost.
Warden...
If you call them, will they hang me?
I'll call them.
Hey, you wardens...
Hey, you Virumaandi...
Tell the Inspector that I don't want
to talk to them.
Put me back in the cell.
Okay madam. Come let's go.
Girish, will you just listen to me?
One minute, please wait...
Why?
Whom are you angry with?
Why are you so angry even when
you are facing death?
Is your anger a manifestation
of your fear of death?
What do you know about death?
Hey Virumaandi...
Now I have understood that
you all are aware of fear.
I don't know what it is.
That was my crime.
Switch off the light.
I told you not to record.
Anger, justice, death penalty,
Annalakshmi, myself, noose tightens
and I die.
Do you know what these things are?
If you read these things in books,
you will not understand. You will not
know what they are. - I can understand.
I know. - What do you know?
- Listen to what I say.
My father was hanged
to death in this jail.
His name is Kathamuthu.
He toiled hard & educated me.
He took loans & performed my marriage.
I became Angela James.
Later, to save me,
he killed James, accepted his crime.
He came here & died.
I again became Angela Kathamuthu.
Doctor Angela Kathamuthu.
Doctorate in Civil law.
I also know what is death penalty and
what happens when noose tightens.
Madam...
No. Please wait outside.
Tell us if there is any trouble. The door
is open & we are waiting outside.
Do you know what it is? - No.
- Tell me, do you know what it is?
No. I don't. Tell me.
My life line.
My fate.
It brings back memories of Annalakshmi.
Her nail.
They would've said that
I had raped Annalakshmi.
Do you know who is Annalakshmi?
She is my wife.
If she had been with me,
I wouldn't have been here.
If she had given testimony,
all lies would have been defeated.
Fate.
I was ill fated.
My mother died when I was 12,
after that, my father
took me to Singapore.
I was living happily there.
He too died.
I had some problems over there and
I was forced to come back here again.
My grandmother brought me up.
She brought me up like a bull.
When man experiences happiness,
he doesn't know what it is?
Only when it is lost...
After winning many prizes in
'Taming the Bull' competitions.
My friends & I got drunk,
and were returning home.
Pour...
Drink... drink.
The bull had gored with it's horns...
Is this good liquor?
Oh grandma!
If you want the bulls to gore you...
If you want to die that way,
take it from me.
Look at his face.
Were you showing your back
for it to attack?
Oh my God blood! - I have blood
that's why it is bleeding. Forget it.
Fix pipes & give it to others.
I caught the bull & turned back.
But it hit me. What to do?
You would've turned back
and ogled at girls.
Don't laugh.
Don't scold a grown up boy.
Take this, Virumaandi.
Priest, I don't care who you are...
Get lost.
I told you to watch the amusement
standing on the electricity pole.
Did I ask you to come here?
Electricity pole!
To die of electric shock?
To hell with your bloody mouth.
If he dies, I must suffer all alone.
Someday we all have to die.
Hey mike! I'll pull that, be careful.
You always pull things.
Come & take your prize.
To hell with your bloody prize.
If he dies, can you bring him back to life?
Tell me, can you bring him
back to life? We will give.
We will give you lot of money.
We will get you money from our boss.
Sell your land to my boss.
Lets name our grandchildren & die.
We?
Will you accompany me?
You ugly black dog.
Should I sell my land to you?
You will add western fertilizers
and ruin my lands.
Our agriculture is different.
Only my grandson must cultivate my land.
Don't think he doesn't know anything.
I'll teach him.
I taught his father too. Never underestimate
him & brand him as a wastrel.
He is very clever.
Like you...
Hey you wastrel.
You useless fellow, let's go.
Grandma, 3 of us.
Can't your bike carry 3 persons?
Why do you keep it with you then?
Where's your chain?
- Here it is.
She won't forget. Start...
Shall we go?
I am sitting in the middle. - Okay.
Let this bull sit at the back.
- Okay.
Have you sat? Let's go.
Yes, grand mother.
I'm holding you.
I'm coming with you.
Oh my grandmother! Go...
Give it to him.
On top of the Banyan tree,
There are beautiful birds.
Males & females,
to make love... come.
Let's go home.
I'll kill you if you go home.
All of you come, eat & go.
Don't shout. - Grandmother...
I tamed Kothaala Thevar's bull.
They gave Rs.1000 as prize money.
It is now fit only for milking.
She is sleeping.
Is she?
Don't act as if you are sleeping.
I'll act as if it is true.
Now I'm going to blow a
conch on your navel.
Rs.1000 & Red bananas.
We have won them.
Look at her acting.
Are you trying to act smart with me?
I'll pour water on your face.
- Don't do it. She might die.
She's not getting up even
after pouring water on her.
Check, what has happened to her?
Keep quiet, don't cry.
Don't shake your hands.
Let's take her to the hospital.
Are you playing the fool,
you scoundrel?
She has left me.
Can't you see?
What did you say?
What did you say when
my father died?
You said you are keeping alive only to
perform this orphan's marriage.
You said you will die only
after my marriage.
My mother is also dead.
What am I to do now? Tell me.
You lied to me that you'll
live for another 10, 15, 25 years.
You said that you'll live till
my son goes to college,
and die on the way to his college.
She said all this, didn't she? She even
smiled. I believed her words.
What am I to do now?
You old woman! Get up.
My mother, what am I to do now?
She left me... my mother.
Who lit the lamp in the street?
Who tied the jasmine to the fence?
When it thunders in the east,
will it rain in the west? Oh my motherl
You pampered me and now, is it
fair to leave me alone?
You never got tired.
Now, you are dead.
How can I bear this loss?
AYNGARAN DVD
I'm a wastrel without a job.
You toiled hard to bring me up
and it has all gone in vain.
You flowed like a river.
I was a wastrel.
Though I'm stone hearted,
yet I'm crying.
I've not repaid the debt I owe you.
You have left me as an Orphan.
You never said a word
before you left me.
I don't have anyone
to share my grief.
O my motherl Tell me what
was in your mind.
I've no peace of mind.
Our men fight for land & women.
I was attacked for the land
and water in that land.
Who's that?
Go.
He went this way. I saw him.
Who unchained our dog?
Who is it? - What happened?
Don't come out.
Fight between
Nallama Naicker & Virumaandi.
Don't come out.
Don't let children come out.
Close the door, quickly.
Wait...
Hey Virumaandi...
I had warned you earlier.
But you never listened to me.
Who hacked you?
I must file an F.I.R.
As long as I was in the hospital,
I felt that Annalakshmi
gave me my life back.
I was on bed for couple of months.
You tamed the bull.
But, were you able to
tame your heart?
She's a nice girl...
I dreamt, that grandma & Annalakshmi
were taking care of me. - Give this to her,
and you keep the money which is
on my fore head. - You have it.
Take this pill Virumaandi.
Your pain will reduce.
Sister, give this pill.
Open your mouth.
Your friends have come
to see you. Come.
Are you fine?
- Do you want anything?
Annalakshmi...
- Wow! He wants Annalakshmi...
After getting discharged
from the hospital,
I went straight to
Annalakshmi's house.
My grandmother was right.
I tamed the bull,
but could not tame my heart.
The bull has come under our control.
- Yes.
The bull has come under our control.
But that girl...
I'll hack you if the bull is hurt.
She says she will cut you.
You are going to become 'Briyani'.
I meant you & not the bull.
Come here. - Yes, I'm.
I called the bull.
- Bull?
She is calling you, isn't she?
- Come... - Go.
Wow! It is under his command.
- Yes, it is under his command. Stop.
Wow! It is under my command.
Tried to behave so wildly.
You donkey!
Oh! She says it is a donkey.
We thought that it was
a bull & it won prizes also.
If you talk any more,
I'll cut your tongue.
He is saying that he's dumb
and wants you to hack him.
He wants you to spare him.
- Keep quiet.
It's getting scared. - Which one?
I meant the bull.
Look, these guys are also using
double meaning words.
What's all this?
The village is in bad state.
Give me my pant. - Here.
When a girl & a bull(man) are alone,
villagers might talk bad about them.
- Yes, let's go.
That's why I'm going with the bull.
I must save her reputation.
You must save the bull's
reputation also.
You go.
Wear the pant first.
Then we'll go peacefully. - Go away.
Keep quiet. Let them unite...
Take your hands off the bike.
I tried to push because,
I found a hump on the road.
You are getting angry.
I came to thank you,
but you are shouting at me.
Why are you talking
to me unnecessarily?
You gave me life.
What's wrong in talking to you.
No use of talking to me.
Go away.
Where do you want me to go?
- My home is here.
You've to cross the railway gate
to go to your house.
What's it?
Hey, what are you doing?
- I thought of repairing it.
Rub the spark plug & it'll start.
You'll come near me under the
pretext of repairing it.
You'll rub against me in the
name of rubbing the spark plug,
and you want me to fall
for you, don't you?
I don't need anything.
I'll go like this.
It's your wish.
- Don't get hacked again.
Whom will you marry after hacking me?
Look what he says!
As if I'm after you to marry me.
I'm going to get married
in a rich family,
and live like a queen.
How can I marry a
reckless man like you?
What's wrong if you
marry a reckless man?
You'll give birth to tiger cubs.
- No thanks. Humans will be okay.
Okay, no problem.
How many do you want?
Looks like you will take care of my
delivery & name the children too.
Why not?
Pulliyeru Pandian. - What's that?
My father's name... to our child.
No one can utter that name.
If you want it to be uttered,
we can name our child as banana.
Since it is going to be our child.
Shall we name him as Red banana?
Look at her, she's laughing.
Chandra Bose. - What?
Name.
Keep quiet, I'll name my
child Tendulkar.
It doesn't sound a familiar name.
Is Chandra Bose your neighbour's name?
But, he's such a great man!
What great man?
Will he slam centuries?
Will he hit sixes?
No. He could hit only the Britishers.
Soorimuthu... - Take your hand off
the bull.
The train is about to come and
it may get crushed under it.
Yes, it's coming to hit my bull.
You are right, you are always right.
Okay. We will name him Tendulkar.
If you accuse your husband of not
allowing you to name the child Tendulkar.
It will be a disgrace to me.
What's the nick name of Tendulkar?
Is it tent?
Shit! - What's it?
I must curse myself for discussing
my child's name with you.
Wow! She has understood.
- I told you not to touch the bull.
Let me atleast touch the bull.
You shameless bull.
Why are you after him?
Come home. I'll lash you.
Shall I come home? Will there be
something for me too?
What? - I'll come there often.
Why? - I & your uncle have
become friends.
I may have to come there often.
You haven't yet reformed even
after God saved your life.
Out of frying pan into the fire.
You are one of those.
Look, what she is saying!
Are others going to live for 1000 years?
Let's live life every moment.
When I talk to Annalakshmi,
I feel as if my heart had wings.
She has fallen in your tarp.
On the Eastern bank,
Your mom & dad,
Are lying dead on the
banks of the river.
If you go there...
They will spread wings.
Are you going there?
AYNGARAN DVD
O reckless manl My eyes have
started to look at you.
I'm alone... look at me.
Morning & evening...
Your face appears in front
of me and makes me go mad.
The village is looking
at us strangely.
It'll spread rumours about us.
- I don't care. Forget it and reply to me.
AYNGARAN DVD
Who's that? Watch carefully.
Your image is chasing me.
My heart is like an untamed bull.
It is getting tamed with
your thoughts.
If I was a winged white ant,
I would go in search of light.
Become the source of
light & devour me.
Though I fly, I wish to unite with you.
What else can I ask for?
Leave them.
I'll beat you...
If this reckless man gets his act,
it's trouble for you,
It will hasten you to marry.
Oh my godl
Virumaandi, the village must be fertile
and there must be rains.
The goat has shaken it's head. Slaughter.
They searched for you at the
place where goats are sacrificed.
You were not available.
Do you know that they sacrificed
it without you?
I know.
Then why are you sitting here?
I don't like it.
Sacrificing the goat?
Yes.
You cooked meat yesterday.
Today, you say you don't like it.
You can cook meat only
after killing the goat.
That's different.
When I see the scapegoat,
your face comes to my mind.
My face must have come to your mind
when you see a tiger.
Why did it happen on seeing a goat?
It shouldn't have happened.
But it did.
There is a medicine for it.
- I...
Why are you wiping it?
Don't you like me?
- Did I say that?
Enough.
How can I marry a girl
who doesn't like me?
No need.
You mean this or our marriage.
No need of anything.
What happened?
The one who is standing on top.
Is he my uncle?
Don't turn immediately.
How did you find that out?
I'll tell you. - Tell me.
I'll tell you once we go home.
This is the sickle which
was used to hack you.
It's from this house.
Look at the initials.
Is it Kottasami?
This is "Koth" not "Kott".
But it is the big bull.
My uncle.
Son-in-law... - Go inside.
Where were you?
I've sent men to search you.
Have you gone mad?
Your initials are imprinted
on that sickle.
It was used to kill me.
Answer me.
You mean to say that
he tried to kill you.
You keep quiet. Let him talk.
Mind your words or else...
Wait... wait...
I've understood.
The same sickle.
Kottasami. - Boss.
Don't you remember this sickle?
When our vehicle broke down,
we left it in Nallama Naickenur.
We lodged a complaint to the Police
about a weapon stolen from it.
They said that they were not aware of it
and stood like innocent persons.
This sickle was also
in that vehicle.
Look how cheap Nallama Naicker's
character is.
Look at his treachery.
They are jealous
about our friendship.
What are you looking at?
I don't care about anyone.
But I treated you as my brother.
Are you suspecting me?
My brother is suspecting me.
I can't bear this disgrace.
Was this the sickle which
was used to kill you?
Boss, no... - Leave me...
Listen to me, boss.
Oh my god!
Leave me.
Leave him...
- Father... no...
My son!
Oh god, someone stop them.
Hey Virumaandi, get up.
Hey Virumaandi, leave him... get...
Annalakshmi is not to be blamed.
Anyone will do like that only.
Though you had suspected me,
I'm not angry with you.
Don't you believe me?
Let the case come to an end.
You & Virumaandi...
You and Annalakshmi are marrying.
I'm definite about that.
I'll announce it in the
village council also.
We all are going to council meeting
in Nallama Naickenur.
No one will touch you. Don't be afraid.
We are there with you. - Afraid? Me?
I smashed a Chinese guy in Singapore.
Anyone with Chinese eyes
is not a Bruce Lee.
Nallama Naicker has
called for the village council.
You are talking as if Tirumalai Naicker
has called for it.
I can beat them black & blue
single handedly.
Do you really have to go to
that village council meet?
If we don't go, they'll call
us cowards. We must go.
Yes, we must go. Go.
But they'll try to provoke you.
Don't get angry and
answer them properly.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
My goodness! Looks like she will
tie him to her apron strings.
She has already tied him
to her apron strings.
The bull has been tamed.
When Kondarasu said that
I'm Kothalan's tool used to scratch.
I didn't understand.
Instead, I got angry
and it ended up in violence.
Whether he insulted me & you,
We should've hacked him
to death there itself.
Will you please come here?
- Why?
I'm asking you, why?
You are simply walking away.
Look how angry she is...
I'll ask her the reason.
What's it?
I'm asking you & you're simply...
I can't talk to you.
If you are a human,
I could've talked to you.
Hey, move...
There is no difference between
you & this bull.
If the door is open.
You'll hit someone.
You are similar to that cow.
So, you mean that one.
I thought you were making fun of me.
No one is making fun of you.
The entire village in
talking bad about you.
Elders mustn't curse us.
They must only bless us.
Whom are you referring to?
Is it Nallamma Naicker?
Do you know he hacked me?
Neither you saw him nor did I.
Did you see him? Leave that.
Why did you beat Kondarasu?
Kothaala stopped me.
He spoke bad about your aunt.
- No...
No, he spoke the truth about
my uncle. That's all.
To differentiate you from a bull,
You must behave like a human.
If not...
Hey, what do you think of yourself?
No woman should talk to me like
that other than my grandma.
This woman will talk.
Now, I've the responsibilities
of your grandma too.
I'll not only be your wife...
What do you say?
What does that mean?
What are you trying to say?
Withdraw the case you filed
against Nallama Naicker.
Looks like you'll ask me to
seek his forgiveness also.
He who forgives is a human.
He who seeks forgiveness
is a great human.
What do you want to say?
You mean to say that
I am not a great human.
You mean to say that
I'm not at all a human.
You can't become a
human at my bidding.
You must become a
human by yourself.
What do you want me to do?
Say that and leave.
Enough of drinking. Go.
Eat & sleep.
Who's that? I say who's that?
I'm Virumaandi.
Wait Konda...
I've not come here to fight.
Then Why have you come?
What's in your hand?
- You slippers.
No one is with me.
I've come alone.
That's what I'm asking you
why have you come? Stop...
He is asking you to stop, isn't he?
Stop, go & eat.
Mind your business.
Look, as a human...
No. She said something else.
Who?
He who can forgive is a human.
He who seeks forgiveness
is a brave man.
Okay.
I'm a brave man.
Are you a human?
Take your slipper.
Will you limp wearing
one slipper?
What's it?
I'm a human. Come.
Where?
To sit.
Sit, you brave heart!
Go & mind your mind.
Ramarasu, get up.
Sir...
The coffee shop would be open by now.
Bring 2 cups of coffee.
Don't go to your favourite shop
if it is open.
I'll kill you.
He's a drunkard.
Look, the baby is crying.
My wife.
He is Virumaandi.
Don't get scared.
He has come seeking forgiveness.
My slippers.
Sir, Kottasami is coming
with men & sickles.
Oh my God! - Oh no! Please come.
You scoundrel! You've shown your
true colour. - Listen to me.
Have you gone mad?
Listen to me.
Oh please, come here.
- I'll kill you.
I will take care of them.
- Traitor.
Son-in-law.
How dare you throw
slippers at me?
Please leave me...
Have you gone mad?
I came here for a compromise.
The dog which threw the slipper is dead.
Forget it.
Don't leave him, I'm coming...
Hack him.
Don't leave any witness behind.
Kill all of them.
It's enough, come.
No one should be left alive.
Come in fast. - Lock the doors...
Where is he?
They are breaking the doors
go & hide elsewhere.
Open the door man.
Ramarasu, open the door.
Oh my God! Save me.
Oh my God! - Go... go.
Don't kill me...
My child... please spare it.
Have gone mad? He's trying to kill me.
I came to save you.
You murderers.
Don't spare him. He's running away...
Catch him... catch him.
Have you gone mad to
save an eye-witness?
There he is... go & catch him.
He's going... Catch him...
Catch him.
O my child! My child is dead.
Hey, come here. I'll kill you.
Don't shout, don't shout.
- You slapped me, didn't you?
There are 20 men with deadly weapons,
they'll also kill you. Keep quiet.
Ask them to kill me.
My child is also dead.
Son-in-law, where are you?
This was destined by God.
What had to happen, has happened?
Come, let's take bath & go.
Before the escapees brings
the police, let's run away.
My hands are full of blood,
let's wash & go.
I say let's go.
- Have you gone...
He is telling you. Go.
I say go.
No use in fighting amongst ourselves!
Ask her to go. They have come.
Hey, go aside.
Hey go to the side.
Greetings madam. Greetings sir.
Please give some way, madam.
They have killed my husband.
Wait... wait.
Please don't touch anything.
They are evidences.
Oh my child... they left you on the road
like an orphan's corpse.
Mr. Naicker, return back my child to me.
Oh my Goddess. I asked you save me,
did you only me, bloody?
Hey give back my child.
Did you see? She's the only witness.
How can I file the case?
She has gone mad.
...my husband will get up and...
What are you doing here
without your shirt?
It is very sultry, isn't it?
That's why I didn't wear. Go to school.
Give my shirt. - First
I will send children to school.
They haven't been going to school
for some days. - Why?
School is in Nallama Naickenur,
we aren't in good terms with its people.
What will they do to our children?
Other children are also going.
No child, will go from
Chinna Kolarpatti.
Nothing will happen if they
don't study for 3-4 months.
Come.
Did it happen as
I had warned you?
You've inflicted an unhealing wound on
the traditional enemity, haven't you?
Are you happy now after
spoiling my life? Go away.
Run... run for your life.
Wherever you go,
your sin will remain your shadow.
I didn't do anything.
- Yes you didn't.
Someone else resembling you
did it, right? - What happened to you?
I got what you people didn't.
My senses. Forget it.
Nallama Naickenur people will kill
your husband because of him.
Why did you give me hopes?
You promised me, didn't you?
Bloody rouge, why did you dash my
hopes of marriage before marrying?
I didn't do... I didn't do.
Didn't you come with us?
Now you are trying to escape.
We went in a group.
Whatever it is, we have
to fight together.
No sir, if he blabbers something to
the police... Shouldn't lie.
Virumaandi listen.
Hey, why are you pushing me?
Hey leave.
What I have been accused of
I am going to do it now, murder.
You and Kothaalan are the killers.
Is it true or not?
True... it's true...
Which is true? - We... I... Kothaalan.
Virumaandi, leave him.
- I have killed all of them.
Hey Virmaa, leave him.
- You didn't do it.
My Virumaa come, listen to me.
Did you hear what he said? It wasn't me.
Cover with this cloth.
- Okay, go... go...
Silly, don't make me a widow
discuss about this later.
Virumaan is innocent,
nothing will happen to him.
I will accept the crime to
prove your innocence, then?
Why do you have to prove it?
I am innocent, that's the truth.
You have killed them that's the truth.
Greetings.
Greetings.
What is the news Kottaisamy? - Nothing sir.
Nothing?
I have brought the witness.
Shall I enquire here or
at the Police station?
Better here.
Mr. Lawyer you also go. - Go...
You have to argue, go.
Virumaandi, don't be afraid.
Eye witness Ramaraj has
come here, trusting us.
We have to take care of him.
You have joined the winning party.
Nothing will happen to you.
I will take care of the rest.
Did you have your food? - No sir.
- Pechi, get the food ready.
Peikaman come. Son-in-law, come.
Naicker insulted me in public.
What did he say?
He accused me of taking bribe inspite
knowing the truth from Kothaala.
What did you say?
I said, I swear I didn't take any bribe.
Did you see?
It was good that I had asked you to
take bribe after doing the work.
Or else it would have been
a false promise.
Hey I didn't kill.
Decision of the court will be
the same, won't it Peikaman?
No. We have to force it
to give such a decision.
Is it court or joke?
I didn't any crime.
I can tell this to any court.
Okay, if they ask who has done it? - He...
My husband and children
will get ruined.
Don't identify him.
I am requesting you and
considering you as my brother.
Please save my husband.
On the day of that incident,
did you go to Ponnurasu's
fields to see him?
Speak the truth.
No sir, I was in Kothaala
Thevar's house with him.
Oh God... oh God! - It is a lie... he is lying.
Order... Order
They have killed people.
I have killed the truth.
I lied and defeated truth.
I was accounted for other's sins.
It is wrong... You were good when
you were in the well.
You have started lying after coming out
of it. It was wrong to bring you out.
As per the complaint filed
by Nallama Naicker.
Under sec.302, following
persons were arrested.
Virumaandi Thevar, KothaalaThevar,
Kottaisamy, Rasukalai,
Chinnakrupu, Kodangi and others.
Since there is not sufficient
evidence to prove their crime,
this court finds them 'Not guilty'
and releases them.
I order the police to investigate
further & nab the real culprits.
Remember one thing.
Don't think falsehood has won.
Only truth will prevail in the end.
I can't sleep peacefully
till then, Can you?
Our soul is the real court.
All this is secondary.
Take the car.
Burst this crackers let that
village resound with our celebration.
I allowed people to dirty my well.
I allowed people to dirty
my grand mother's well.
I must get rid of this
burden of my sins.
Shall I will all my property to
this village as repentance?
Oh no! Don't do like that.
- I have done it.
Secretly, I have willed my property to
people through Mr. Naicker's lawyer.
What about you?
I have money in the bank.
You will spend it.
Land will have everlasting value.
How could you will your entire
properties like a fool?
I still have one property
with me? - Which one?
No... no, you don't have any
relationship with them.
Go somewhere.
Run away as far as you can... run away.
Are you asking me to go alone?
You said that you are
grandma & wife to me.
Was it a lie?
Take me also with you.
Now you are my wife.
Within 2-3 days, lets inform Kothaala.
- Oh God... without informing anybody,
Today, right now.
Now I'm not talking as your wife
but grandma.
Lord Virumaandi & Goddess Pechi,
you must save your children.
They haven't brought any offerings.
Here... tie it... tie it...
God, grant them long happy life
with children.
Virumbu, please turn.
You didn't give me offerings.
I'm going urgently.
I have deposited some
money in the bank?
You are saying later!
I don't disbelieve you,
but It's traditional to offer money to
the priest on happy occasions.
You can offer whatever
you have with you now.
Not money, but I am offering gold.
Oh... okay.
Oh Lord Virumaandi.

May you be blessed with a long &
happy life with your husband.
I thought it was one of your jokes
when you said, "I am coming with my wife".
Okay, she looks good.
You are lucky to have married him.
It's rare to find such a good man.
God didn't give me a son like him,
but gave me a rogue son.
What to do?
You will stay here for
few days, won't you?
We will be here for 2-3 days.
Why just 2-3 days?
Stay here permanently.
This is his house. Did he tell you?
Hey, didn't you tell her?
I will tell her. - You will not.
Give my keys, I will go.
Give me 2 Beedies and a match box.
Give 2 Beedies and a match box.
Hey give money and go.
Go.
Wait, I have to tell you something.
He took the blame for my son's
crime in Singapore.
He has come back losing his job.
Okay leave it. - I have already left him.
He is enjoying in Singapore
after marrying a Chinese girl.
He isn't coming here
for any festival.
No letters also from him.
I don't bother about him anymore.
After my death, all my properties
will go to him only.
Then, it'll take 100 years for me to
get your properties. - Come here.
I will go to a movie tonight.
You enjoy tonight.
Come brother.
When have you come?
Look, he has come here
after getting married.
Is it? - Yes, they are going to
enjoy here.
They are on their honeymoon here.
I am also going for the
night show of a movie.
What do you look so downcast?
How come you married a fool like me?
There is nothing lacking in my husband.
Why should I worry?
I have came to a decision.
What?
No more Tendulkar. We will name
your father's name to our child.
Leave me.
Don't... please listen...
What is this... like a beast?
What is this, you obstinate man?
Did some one stab you?
While taming the bull,
it's horns hurt me. - Oh god!
It's all part of the game.
How?
Shall I tell you?
While grappling the bull, like this.
You will get hurt won't you?
What?
I have a mark of hurt every time
I tamed a bull.
How's it, I didn't get hurt
taming an untamed bull?
Show me your hand.
Oh! What are you doing?
Mark...
My life time...
I will get the medicine.
Don't you want me to apply medicine?
Shall I apply sacred ash?
Only if you leave me.
Please leave me.
I say leave me.

Shall we ask for some other boon?
Lets seek an immortal life from god.

Give me a coffee.
You have opened your shop
early in the morning?
Why did you come here?
I thought you were sleeping.
So I came here to have coffee.
Brother, do you want Jaggery
coffee or black coffee?
Black coffee. - Okay brother.
Thinking that you both,
would be sleeping.
I came and opened the shop.
Kottaisamy & Rasukalai came
in search of you from the bank.
They asked for you.
I told them that you were sleeping.
Did they meet you?
Son Virumaandi, where are you going?
Come in.
Madam, finish your interview quickly
& leave the place. - Why?
We are expecting trouble in the jail.
Pack up all these things.
Move.
Take him to main gate office and
handcuff him. Handcuffs them.
Okay? - Okay sir.
Come in Arumugan.
I will bring the visitors
through main gate.
As soon as I cross
you lock the doors.
Move... move... quick.
Come.
You raided without
giving any intimation.
Don't think of enjoying alone by
spoiling our livelihood?
This will not happen.
- What is it man?
Madam, you get going.
Hey take her.
Come madam, .
Why are you screaming
infront of outsiders.
Don't blabber without understanding
the facts.
This jailer will not enjoy
and will not allow others to enjoy.
He has conducted this raid.
I am not involved in this.
If he gets hold of the packets,
we'll lose Rs.30 lakhs.
Who will answer the persons
who provide it.
My family is outside.
Raid is going on in the kitchen.
If anybody blows the whistle fearing
beatings, we'll be in a fix.
I have 2 more years.
If anything happens... - Hey, go away...
Don't shout unnecessarily.
Ups and downs are
natural in business.
Think that our time
isn't good today.
Your time isn't good.
You took away 50o/o profit
without doing anything!
Hey... wait... wait...
Drugs are worth Rs.30 lakhs.
If anything happens to the lot,
Gone. - Gone, we will
create a riot in the jail.
Go and create a riot. I mean it.
There will be an inquiry only if Jailer
comes out & writes the report.
If you allow the police men
to file the FIR, then we had it.
Did he commit 24 murders!?
Didn't I get him death sentence
by filing the FIR?
You will also face the same
fate if Jailer comes out.
Don't let him out.
Make sure Jailer gets
killed in the jail riot.
Reddy, go and start the riot.
Hey call them.
Where are you going? - Come here
Do you have a cell phone? - No.
I will send it. - Go.
It will be authentic only when there are
loss of lives on both sides.
Got it?
Hey switch off the camera.
Switch it off man.
What are you watching man?
Go and snatch it.
Arumugan come in...
close the door.
Madam.
Sir, that lady and the cameraman are
running towards C-Block on the left.
Handcuff them.
- Hey close the gate & catch them.
Okay, over sir.
What is happening there man?
Who is at the gate?
No.
Don't... I am warning you.
Sir, I am Peikaman speaking.
Mr. Jailer is lying wounded
in the kitchen.
Large scale violence has broken out.
Hey if anything happens
to jailer, that's all.
Okay, is jailer near you?
Yes but he can't talk. He has been
stabbed. There is a huge loss of blood.
I don't think he will survive.
Hey, you don't touch anything.
You come to C'block immediately.
There is an important task for you there.
Throw away the walkie-talkie,
it'll have your finger prints.
Hey, Gopal. Hey come here.
Sir, they have started writing.
Catch them and come.
Sir, is it easy to go in?
I can't go.
Sir, I have a family to support.
Hey, its here and you are shouting.
Throw this over the compound wall.
Ask our leader to collect it
from the jail compound. Go.
Hey, if you reveal this to anybody.
I will kill all of you.
Okay, you all have a job to do.
That Jailor's body...
Hey move.
Hey what is this?
Why are you asking 'what'?
He is having a pistol.
Ask our people to come out.
Let all the items which are kept inside,
go out. Take it.
Lets lock him inside and go out. Go.
Hey go. Hey lift it up.
If you catch them.
- What will you give me?
What do you want?
Annalakshmi.
I and Virumaandi got married.
Now, I don't belong to this house.
I don't want any properties.
Hereafter, I will not come this side.
He has tied auspicious thread.
Leave me.
If I leave you,
then you will file a case
claiming your rights.
No... I swear on my auspicious thread.
I will not do such things.
Leave me... I will go with him
If he comes to know about this,
then you are dead.
Hey sit.
Are you threatening us by
showing the auspicious thread?
I'll snatch it off and tie it again.
Hold her hands.
. - Oh no, I will not...
Tie it... - Oh no I'll not.
You tie it to her.
Tie.
No sir. She may die.
Kothaalan, what is it?
If she dies bury her.
Kothaalan, open the door.
If she is alive,
let her life as your wife.
Okay come.
Oh God! What did you do to her?
Why are you coming out?
You go inside, you are the groom.
Hey go away.
Hey, take that bottle.
What happened?
- She is crying a lot.
She is very angry.
She is a poor girl.
Please leave her.
Hey shit. I will slipper you. Go away.
- You keep quiet.
Hey go man. Go and have
your nuptials with her.
Sir, it's day time.
- Hey, go man.
Night Watchman's don't have
nuptials in the night,
They will have it only
in the day time. Go...
Sir... - Hey, what happened?
What happened?
Annalakshmi, went inside
the kitchen & locked it.
Annalakshmi, hey Annalakshmi.
Hey, open the door.
- Break the door.
Muthu, break the door.
Hey Annam... don't want,
listen to me. Hey.
Hey go man.
Hey Annam. - Oh God, Annalakshmi.
Oh god, Annalakshmi,
they have killed her.
Ask what is possible. Money?
Can you commute my death sentence?
Oh, don't harm me.
I refused to tie
the auspicious thread.
All of them forced me.
Murder case will be filed against you
...go away... - Let's go.
Don't harm me.
Viruppa, I am not the one.
Kottaisamy, had tied
the auspicious thread?
Where is Kothaalan?
- He is in the house.
Really? - I swear. - Show me.
Hey open the door.
Who is it? - Kodangi.
Are you not feeling well?
Hey, open the door.
Brother, go away Virumaandi has come.
Brother, Virumaandi has come.
Who is it? What is the noise there?
Oh God! Oh God! He is killing him.
Oh, please leave them.
Oh God!
Sir please leave him.
Don't...
Brother, please leave my husband.
If you take another step,
I will throw him down.
Then, he will die.
Oh please save me.
Oh God, please save me.
Oh god, don't leave him.
Don't leave my child.
Virumaandi, save him.
Virumaandi, don't go.
Virumaandi, kill my father.
Don't leave him kill him.
Hey Virumaandi, don't run... stop.
Constables, catch him from that side.
Hey, start the vehicle.
Oh God. - What happend?
What happened? Where is he?
Virumaandi stabbed him
and went away.
Is he alive?
Hey, break the doors.
First admit him in hospital.
Sir, it's locked. - Hey move.
Go away. Go.
Hey Virumaandi, I know
that you are inside.
Come out.
Come out man.
Hey, catch the bull.
Hey he is running away.
Catch him. - Sir, he is gone.
Sir, there is a power failure.
Hey, catch the bull.
Listen to me.
You can't escape by running
inside the forest.
Hey, switch off the light.
Look there.
Along with the police,
the entire village is coming.
Come, get into the vehicle.
Why?
Enemy's... enemy is a friend.
There is no time to talk further.
Come on...
Hey, go.
Greetings. You carry on.
You eat well and leave this place.
Keep this cell phone.
First eat. Then I will give you.
Don't stay in one place.
You sleep in the running
bus during night time.
In the day time, don't
come out & stay in some place.
I will consult Vaidiyanadhan
& tell you about your surrender.
Serve him some more. - Okay.
Police has come. Inspector has come.
Has he also come here?
Who is it? Who is it?
No one... you carry on.
Sir, you eat.
You carry on.
Goddess will protect you.
Good people will not face sorrow.
You eat.
Virumaandi get up...
- Oh, let him eat.
There is no time for that.
Police has come.
You should send Virumaandi
out immediately.
Hey, get inside.
Sir, it seems Inspector wants
to search the house.
When I asked him for the search warrant,
he said that he doesn't have it.
Naicker sir, I said it isn't
necessary if it's an emergency.
He is a murderer.
6 people have died.
It is a crime to help him.
I believe that you will not do it.
You believe me, don't you?
Then, why are you searching here?
Why are you unnecessarily standing here,
when we are wearing our saris?
Forgive me. - What is this sir?
Like a dog entering the house!
I will go out. - First you go man.
Mother, I will go and come.
Long live.
Oh goddess.
Sorry sir, I am doing my duty.
No problem, I'm not faulting you.
You can go.
Hey, stop that van.
What is that van? Hey stop
...stop the van.
Hey move away. Hey move.
Hey move. What are you looking at?
Why have you stopped?
Beat the drums.
Where is Virumaandi?
- He is under the van.
Move the van.
Hey move it.
Go without disturbing us.
See you, Naicker sir.
Is it Virumaandi? How are you?
I am okay. I don't know
whom to believe.
Don't worry, I will explain
everything to him.
Yes, I meant the lawyer.
You go to Madurai,
after I tell you.
Till then.
We'll settle our enemity later.
I want Virumaandi.
Orelse I'll kill all of you.
Even your age will not be
a deterrent to me.
What do you say?
Aarthi. What should I say?
I am coming out of fear.
This side...
Sir, Virumaandi speaking.
- Yes Virumaandi.
Yes, it got disconnected.
I am coming to see you only.
Sir, I am in Chennai.
I am Chennai.
You stay there
I have come near you.
Hey, take that cell. - Sir.
Take it man.
Move man.
No one has touched
anything, isn't it? Go.
Go man... go... Take it. Go...
Go.
Hello, yes, it is me only.
Hey shit.
Oh god, when?
Shall I come?
Okay you come here
I will be here only.
Yes, I will be here.
They have seen the body just now.
Hey shit, why are you shouting
like a wounded pig?
Take him to the hospital?
Say that his hand got caught
in the pump set.
Don't blabber gun... etc
You scoundrel, go.
You surrender in the Madurai court.
What?
It is prudent, that we shouldn't
believe police men.
You have been paid to protect us,
yet you are asking me to surrender?
Don't insinuate without knowing the law.
I am telling you to surrender
to save your life.
Before Virumaandi gives his statement...
Mr. Lawyer... explain to him.
After you give your statement,
it will be called
First Information Report.
Then, it will become second.
Sir, Naicker's people are
coming here.
Hey move away. Hey go man.
Hey move man.
Don't simply watch, go that side.
This is Naicker's cell phone.
Virumaandi number is stored in it.
It is very easy to find his place.
Before you surrender,
I will find him.
I know man.
Don't behead him foolishly and throw
his head in the river.
I am telling this for your own good.
Dig deeply... put more salt.
Police dog is very
dangerous. - I know man.
My dear son.
My son who killed you?
Oh my dear son.
Son, who will look after me now?
He had tried to phone
someone before he died.
He would have tried you.
But he has a cell phone, didn't he?
Definitely, it will be Virumaandi.
That's why, they say don't
feed milk to the snake.
You are also suspecting
Virumaandi, are you?
I should file an FIR.
Yes. We must find the
person who killed your father.
You also know where
Virumaandi stays, don't you?
Mr. Palpandi, I may not be a
great lawyer like you,
but still I am a lawyer like you,
an honest lawyer.
My father had commanded
me to be one.
So if you don't mind.
Okay, you carry on.
I know who has killed
my father? - Who?
You also know that.
My father had told me
that 'truth never hides its face'.
I am following that till now.
Not a single child will talk
against Virumaandi in this town.
They will know
what we are talking about.
I am telling you all this personally
because I respect you.
For beating the policemen
black and blue.
And for burning the police station,
we are all ready to surrender.
Since my father's procession
should proceed without any disturbance,
we aren't creating any problem.
Mind it.
I have told them.
D2 & D1 accused have come.
Will reach there in a short while.
Hey go that side.
Mr. Lawyer, no problem should crop up.
Otherwise there will be
law & order problem!
Did you hear?
Hey, has 'PP' come?
Hey go that side.
Go... catch her.
Don't look at them. Go...
Vaidiyanadhan's car is coming.
You rascal, why are you stopping the car?
Greetings. - Greetings.
You shouldn't support him sir.
Sir, I didn't come to work.
Did you see my face?
It has been 4 days
since I have shaved.
Have you ever see me in the
court with an unshaved face?
Greetings madam. Greetings sir.
I am that old Govindarajan.
He is Govindarajan my old client.
He has murdered 2 people
by your grace.
Is it necessary for you?
I want to meet the
magistrate personally.
Shall I take leave?
Why do you seek our permission?
Hey remove your hand.
But one thing.
That man won't come to
the court alive. That is for certain.
I will most certainly pour
yellow water on him.
Why do you talk like this
in the court?
Go quickly. Why wriggling like a snail?
Didn't I ask you to prepare
a tea? Did you?
Quick.
Come on.
Get inside quickly.
Madam, I don't know how to thank you.
Go man.
Hey, catch him... catch him...
Don't leave him.
Virumaandi is running. Catch him.
In the case of Nallama Naicker,
no body has given
statement against Virumaandi.
Your honour, I don't care about it.
After investigating the
murder of Annalakshmi,
and murders committed earlier,
I can prove that Virumaandi is
linked with all those murders.
Repeat what I say. - Yes sir.
I swear... - I swear.
Say loudly. - I swear.
I will speak the truth, .
- I will speak the truth,
nothing else but the truth.
- Nothing else but the truth.
Friend. - Shut up & keep quiet.
Oh lord!
Was Annalakshmi alive, when you
saw her the last time.
Yes sir.
Is there any witness for that?
Greetings sir. He will not
commit any crime.
These 4 guys said that
they are coming from the bank.
I am a fool.
I showed her house to them.
I didn't know that they had
come to kidnap her.
Those who helped you
in committing the murder,
you killed them to destroy
the evidence.
We have found your hand print along
with the hand prints of those 4.
At the place of the incident.
There is evidence of
raping Annalakshmi.
What is this?
Your honour forensic report stipulates,
that the semen of the accused Virumaandi,
matches with the semen, found in the
body of Annalakshmi.
Yes your honour. - Okay... Okay...
It has been proved that you had
sex with Annalakshmi by force.
Understood?
It is proved by the Post Mortem
report that you had raped her.
What? I raped her?
Then, are you denying it?
No, I didn't say 'no'.
Sir, it is true that
we brought that girl,
because we were afraid that Virumaandi
may kill us if we refused.
I swear.
Those people brought her
very roughly.
And made her as your sacrificial goat.
Your honour, that girl
struggled a lot,
and scratched you with her nail.
Your flesh has been found
in Annalakshmi nail.
You have a wound on your heart.
You have, haven't you?
Then?
After raping her, to destroy the evidences.
You killed that girl.
And you are asserting that
she committed suicide.
Am I right?
Forensic report shows that
you had sex with that girl.
But you are saying that
you didn't rape that girl.
How is it possible?
Sir, there was no need
for me to rape her.
She was my wife.
Where did you get married?
I had performed
Virumaandi's parent's marriage.
I had only named him Virumaandi.
If he had told me, I would have
performed his marriage also.
He never told me.
So you mean to say that you didn't
perform his marriage in the temple?
Sir... what? I swear...
I didn't perform his marriage.
If it was performed,
then your statement will become false.
Okay, you go.
That's all, your honour.
Mr. Vaidiyanadhan, do you want to
re-examine accused No.1?
No, Not necessary your honour.
I want to re-examine A1.
I may be permitted please.
Permission granted.
- Thank you your honour.
Accused Virumaandi.
So, it is established that your marriage
wasn't performed in the temple.
Do you have any other record
of your marriage, like registration...
No sir, I don't have
that much knowledge.
I thought it was enough
if we inform the priest.
You know how to registrar
your properties in the village,
how can I believe that
you didn't know this?
If you pretend to be good person
infront of people,
you can't escape from the murder charge.
Sir, he hasn't committed any crime.
Those who are giving false
evidence such dogs will go to hell.
Kottalan Devan was behind this murder,
first call him to
the witness box.
Judge sir, give justice
to our brother.
Order...
Yes proceed.
Your honour,
Kottalan Devan, who has become an
approver & admitted his sins,
I humbly request you
to show mercy to him.
There has been many murders
committed in 'kundarasu' garden.
Even though, Kottalan Devan is linked
with those murders,
since Virumaandi provoked him,
I humbly request you to give
him severe punishment.
In 'Theni' district.
Kottalan Devan, who helped
Virumaandi to commit 24 murders.
Under Sec. Act 302 of Indian Penal Code,
he has been given life imprisonment.
Under IPC Section 302,
accused no.1 Virumaandi
is sentenced to death.
Sir, why did you do like this?
Sir, please change the judgement.
Give sentence of death
to that rascal.
Sir, why did you give
him sentence to death.
After giving a deep thought.
After giving a deep thought.
Without any hesitation.
I am handing out this judgement to them.
Come on, brother... Come on.
Hey catch him.
Break his hand and legs.
Even if you murders so many times,
you will be hanged only once.
Leave me.
Brother... Oh Godl
Can you nullify my death sentence?
What can you give me? Man.
Hey talk respectfully.
Listen to me.
Anything that will make you happy,
I will make arrangements to get it for you.
I feel happy to see
you dying in this riot.
Come on... come on...
All of you come out.
Come... AII of you come out.
Kottalan?
What Kottalan?
I will give Kottalan
as the sacrificial goat.
You find that girl and the tape.
I will hand over Kottalan to you.
In this riot,
whatever you do, no one will
come to know about it.
How will you hand over Kottalan?
You find that girl and the camera.
I will definitely hand him over to you.
Hey junior jailer sir
wants to talk to you.
What will I get in return?
Okay, I will do it?
Do you want that girl &
the tape?
2 persons? Okay.
Don't include 'Virumaandi in your list.
I will see to him,
Carry on. Okay.
Come on. - Come on...
Brother that lady...
She's running away along with that man.
Give me that.
What are you doing?
What is it? They may come here.
- Come on.
Brother.
Leave me.
Beat him.
Beat him again.
I had beaten him.
- Beat him again.
That's enough! Come.
Sir, where are you going?
I want to meet Chennai jailer.
- Then?
I don't know anything. I have to
hand you over to Peikaman.
Stop.
Come.
Come...
Go... go...
Hey, where is the camera?
Hey, if you come near me,
I will kill her.
Hey, don't come. I will kill her.
- Kill her.
Hey, leave him. Catch him.
Sir, we are all waiting for you.
Have you sent the Firing squad inside?
Yes sir.
I am telling the truth.
Enquiry can start, only
if the jailer comes and gives the report.
If you allow policemen
to file FIR. That's all!
Did he murder 24 persons?
Didn't I file a FIR &
got him death sentence?
If jailer comes outside,
you will also face the same situation.
Don't allow him to come outside.
Oh No! My God!
This tape is an important evidence.
I believe you more than Peikaman.
We should immediately
take her and the tape outside.
They have given the shooting order.
Don't go in prisioner's dress.
They will shoot you.
You wear one of our men's dress
who is lying wounded.
Hereafter they don't need this.
Hey move away. Don't disturb.
- Can't you listen to me?
No comments.
Everything is in our control.
Please break the front door.
I should break the door.
Carry sir, let's take him.
No I am dead meat.
Sir.
Don't be lumbered with me unnecessarily.
You don't worry about me.
I want to safe guard
my honour, understood? - Yes sir.
No harm should come to our people.
If anything comes, shoot at sight.
You don't worry.
What is happening there?
There is a riot here.
He has escaped. I am searching for him.
He too has gone.
- Okay, I will come there.
If there's any danger,
He will take care of everything.
You don't worry.
Who? Who is going to leave?
Excuse me sir. If you permit,
I will go inside.
Virumaandi, I shouldn't be doing this.
I will give you this
trusting you. Take it.
Take this. Take this.
Sir, no... I am not used to it.
Thank God. Don't learn also.
It is good that you don't
know all these things.
Go...
Brother, we couldn't break the lock.
It won't work out...
It will not.
Come on... man... come on.
Throw it down.
Come on. Take.
Virumaandi take this.
Go...
Come on.
Come out... come out.
AYNGARAN DVD
God is coming out from the sanctuary.
It is a day for getting justice.
It can't be controlled by law.
Who dares to stop him?
It is employee's time
to give them back.
It is time to get money for those
who committed sins.
AYNGARAN DVD
Those who have committed mistakes,
won't God come Himself &
punish them?
We aren't getting justice
though we have the law.
Is there any use of law?
AYNGARAN DVD
Today only we are getting true justice.
The way master of justice go,
our Virumaandi men also follow him.
Who can dare to stop him?
Hey stop... Hey Virumaa...
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, please.
Hey bring them safely.
Is there any way?
Sir, they can come from that side.
Come that side.
You can get down from there.
Oh God, Virumaandi.
Don't want. Don't want, Virumaandi.
Another murder isn't the
punishment for a murder.
Don't do another murder... please.
Those who believe that jail is a place
where criminals are punished,
and it is a place to reform them.
I want to tell one thing to them.
Sir, I don't think such well meaning
ideas are bearing fruits here, .
According to my knowledge.
Now they have clearly shown in the
media what really is happening here.
There will be enquiry if the Jailer
comes out & submits a report, right?
If you allow police men to
file FIR. That's all!
Did he commit 24 murders?
Didn't I file a FIR & got
him the death sentence?
Today he has come here by getting
special permission from the jail.
He has been accused of the crimes
he hadn't committed,
and he has been sentenced to death.
Mr. Virumaandi, since you are
an accused sentenced to death,
What is your opinion?
Great persons like
Doctor Anjali madam,
are seeking Governer's pardon for me.
If they forgive and release me.
I don't wish to live.
I will be grateful to them
& try to be a good person.
If you ask me, will I be happy?
No sir.
I would just count my days
in the absence of Annalakshmi.
That is it.
If they decide that
I am a bad person, a criminal,
and sentence me to death.
Sir, I'll accept that also.
As Annalakshmi died,
I will be happy thinking,
I am also dying like her.
Sir, Annalakshmi used to
tell one thing frequently,
Those who know to forgive,
are called 'human being',
and those who ask for forgiveness
are great persons.
Those who ask for forgiveness,
are great persons.
Sir, now I am trying to
become a great man.
Law will change and one day
it will give respect to human beings.
Instead of waiting for that.
I too support doctor Aanjala
who is struggling to initiate reforms in it.
But Doctor Aanjala.
If we abolish Death Sentence,
Murderer will lose the fear of
extreme punishment,
and won't the percentage
of crimes increase?
That is unsubstantiated hypothesis.
85 countries in the world have
abolished Death Sentence.
But India which supports Ahimsa
is still hesitating to do it.
According to me,
except natural death,
other deaths are murders!
