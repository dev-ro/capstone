We could not have been
more wrong all of this.
I'm not quite sure
what time I'll be home,
maybe around...
7:00 or 8:00 tonight.
Um...
I was telling you about this...
Filming thing we got going on.
You know, I was telling you they do
these internal communication things
at the space agency.
Anyway, they asked me if, um,
they could, sort of,
have a day in the life.
They want to do day in the life of some
of the senior members of the agencies.
Um, I'm not...
So how does this work?
Should... are you guys
rolling now or...?
Yeah, that's why they're here.
Hello, everybody,
welcome to our home.
Um... this is
my lovely daughter, Mary.
- Hi.
- She's a good girl.
She's at university.
And, uh, she's very smart
like her mom.
Is it, like, going on the telly?
Mm-mm.
I'm not going on telly.
No, it's just for internal...
Communications.
- It's so they have a kind of resource.
- Okay.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, right, okay.
Okay, I'm gonna change.
All right, sweetie.
Okay. See you in a bit.
She's a bit shy.
Can I get you guys a coffee
or a tea or...?
Well, I mean, obviously
she's incredibly inspiring.
Um, I think,
especially nowadays,
uh, to, like, have a mum who's
the head of, you know, one of the
biggest international space agencies.
Obviously, my mom's Canadian,
um, but my dad was British.
They met, uh, at university.
He was doing a semester.
He was very special,
very special man.
He was a peacekeeper.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We don't talk him that much,
I suppose.
As much as we should.
Oh, no.
Um... I'm really sorry,
I think I have to get this.
Just... sorry,
bear with me one moment.
Hello?
What?
You're kidding me.
Uh, no, I can be there
in about 25 minutes or so.
Yeah, yeah, just, uh,
just hang tight.
Ask... yeah, get Alex on it.
Just tell...
Okay, good, he knows.
No, no, no, just, uh,
just hang tight.
Um, I'll be right there,
hang on. Okay.
I'm so sorry, babe.
Uh...
Something has come up.
I'm really sorry.
I have to go.
ISS, be advised.
Thermal increase detected
in nodes two and three.
I repeat, thermal increase
detected in nodes two and three.
Permission to attempt top hover
and reboot of node two.
ISS, please confirm
to mission control
when you are ready to proceed
with the module rack replacement.
3va hatch in three, two, one.
Unity node,
module visibility confirmed.
Copy that, Jim.
Jim to Francois, come in.
Reading you loud and clear, Jim.
Good 'cause you owe me
big time, over.
ISS, copy that.
Connecting additional
cable harnesses
for electrical
and data systems rerouting.
Fluid lines check confirmed
for thermal control.
Copy that, Jim.
Data systems routing
is good to go.
Copy that. Making my way back...
Receiving interference
with your last transmission.
Can you please repeat?
Can you confirm a strange sound
being picked up by our radios?
We don't recognize
that frequency band.
Please check and confirm
if this is a comms breach.
Uh, that's a negative.
All radio frequency bands
are nominal.
Whatever that sound is,
it's not coming from us.
Whoa.
Mission control,
you seeing what I'm seeing?
We seem to have lost
your video uplink.
Please elaborate on
your last transmission.
It looks like some kind
of solar storm disturbance.
Francois, do you see this?
Jim, I see it.
Whatever that is, it's
disrupting our communication.
Were there any solar storms
expected to be coming our way?
That's a negative, Jim.
No solar storms
have been reported.
It looks like the fourth of July
up here right now.
Heavy vibrations.
I can see it on the panels.
Whoa!
Francois, engage the airlock.
Airlock engaged.
I'm making my way back, but...
This is so bright,
I'm being blinded right now.
Jim, it looks like your tether
is becoming unstable.
We suggest you use the handle
grips to maneuver.
I can feel tension
on this thing.
I'm gonna have to disengage.
I got to disconnect this thing
if I'm gonna get back.
Jim...
I can't see anything.
My tether...
My tether, I can feel is tense.
Come in, Jim.
Tell me what you see.
It's still not known exactly
what caused the power outage
on the ISS,
but what's complexing is that
all of the satellites
that were in orbit
were affected at the exact same
moment as well.
Now, of course,
the tragic outcome
is that astronaut Jim Marcell
is currently missing,
presumed dead.
And... it's possible that
his tether was disconnected
during the incident.
Uh, well, firstly, I just...
Want to say that, uh,
I've known Jim for a long time
so, um, obviously this
is a very difficult time,
but we've...
We've got to get on.
We've got to find out
what happened.
Um...
We have a lot of footage
that's come down
from, um, the ISS.
And we've got a team now that's
going through that frame by frame,
and we don't know
what it is yet.
Uh, we do know that it's not
a solar flare,
we know that it's not
an electrical storm.
This isn't the first time
that an anomaly has appeared
above our planet.
We first encountered it in 1990.
And it was visible
for about two months.
But before we could get
any further data,
any meaningful data,
it vanished,
never to be seen again,
until now.
Yeah, good morning.
Yeah.
Yeah, I will update you
as soon as I'm in.
Well, um...
Basically, when I got the call,
um, I'd been asleep
for about 45 minutes.
I've been working on a project
for the last eight months,
um, so it's been pretty intense.
They wouldn't tell me
anything on the phone,
space agency protocol,
only that it was
of a classified nature,
which requires my expertise in
the field of gravitational waves
and space anomalies.
The idea that this anomaly
is emitting some form of
gravitational wave surprised us all,
and it was definitely outside
anything predicted by science.
What could cause
such a phenomena?
I don't know yet.
This morning,
the space agency reported that
astronaut Jim Marcel was killed
by incoming space debris
whilst on a maintenance mission
on the ISS.
A space agency spokesperson
said this is a tragic incident.
But Jim Marcell was
passionate about his job,
and their condolences
go to his family.
A name was given
to this anomaly.
We started calling it
"the void",
which is way better
than "anomaly 234-b."
it had the appearance...
Well, similar to the remnants
of a supernova.
But, due to its proximity
to earth,
we knew it was something
completely different.
But during its appearance,
we also detected
a short-burst radio wave
and the signal was...
It was...
Transmitted in a very
specific frequency,
1420 megahertz.
This 1420 megahertz frequency,
a very strange
and complex phenomenon,
also known as
the "hydrogen line,"
the radio astronomers
who first recorded it,
they chased their tails trying
to find the source of the...
Of the signal,
to no avail.
And then it disappeared.
All these years later,
we're still trying
to find the source.
Never reoccurred.
If we miss any opportunity
to investigate this now,
we may have to wait for another
25 years for it to reappear,
if it reappears.
And what we need to know is,
who put it there?
Where did it come from?
Is it intelligent?
Is it trying to
communicate with us?
I mean, these are the questions
that we need answers to.
So we have reconnaissance
probes in orbit
to do routine external examinations of
spacecraft and satellites in orbit,
as well as
planetary exploration,
when the time comes.
So I made a call to authorize
a probe be sent on a recon
mission into the void.
Maneuvering in space
isn't quite as simple
as it's often portrayed
in the movies.
Um, to move from
one orbit to another
takes quite a lot of energy.
So we had to...
Adjust the craft's orbit
to intersect
with that of the void.
If something goes wrong here
with the probes,
that might be it.
It might be our only chance
to have a look.
We always expected
to lose communication,
just not necessarily that soon.
But, thankfully,
all is not lost.
Our probes are fitted with
state-of-the-art, high-definition cameras
that stream directly
to our servers here.
And, even in that brief,
briefest of windows,
we were able
to maintain a signal,
and we captured imagery.
As our probe moved closer,
we noticed this
tunnel-like structure,
just directly ahead of us.
Now, have a look at this
light at the center.
This is light and cosmic matter
entering and leaving,
so what we're potentially
looking at here
is a wormhole.
And, you know, we all know that
there is an entrance and an exit,
so if this indeed a wormhole,
then the next question is,
what is on the other side
of the void?
It looks like we're dealing
with a wormhole.
We still need to run more data
and have a look over all the
images that we've been sent back,
just to know exactly
what we're dealing with here.
Technically, this is
not a wormhole, huh?
Well, not in my opinion.
In the case of the void...
Well, we are sure
that an entry point exists.
We call it "the throat."
The question is whether
a second throat exists,
an exit point.
Would whatever we send in there
emerge the other side
or would it remain stuck there
for eternity?
Our finding was
a little bit like, uh,
jumping and looking
over a really high wall,
but only getting a glimpse
of what's on the other side.
However, each time you jump, you
capture a little bit more information.
And what began to emerge for us
was a kind of flash frame
of what appeared to be a
spherical shape in the distance.
Now, upon closer examination
of this flash frame,
we began to see the potential for
this spherical shape to be...
Another planet.
We could be looking at the first
contact with intelligent life.
That is a major possibility
that we're looking at right now.
Now we have something,
something really big.
Perhaps too big.
I don't think we're prepared
or have the resources
to investigate further.
I mean,
something of this magnitude.
I want to send
our astronauts up there.
I understand what happened to Jim Marcell.
I can appreciate that.
I want it noted
that I flatly object.
I cannot support that.
The reality is that
we have to get information.
How are we going to get it?
We can't continue
to send probes up there,
they don't have the capability.
We need to be in communication
with somebody on the other side.
Same conversation
for the next two years.
If we miss the window,
we miss our opportunity.
What stage are the probes at?
What stage are we at
with their development?
We've lost them.
They went through,
and we have no signal
whatsoever.
Totally interrupted,
totally blacked out.
It say here that so far we've
lost a total of, uh,
$3.5 million in technology
with the probes.
It's not a bottom-line thing here,
we're not talking about a spreadsheet,
we're talking about probably one of the
most important things that has happened
in... in space exploration,
and I think we need to
move forward on that
and I think we need to
move forward now.
What do you suggest?
Our immediate focus
is to define this mission.
Several ideas were discussed, but nobody's
interested in sending more probes.
The determination was to
finance a full mission.
And we were able to raise
a large sum of funding.
In fact, the largest sum
of funding ever raised
in the history of
space exploration.
Because...
The mere glimpse of a
potentially habitable planet,
well, I have to tell you, that
raised an awful lot of interest.
Regardless, it was agreed upon
to keep this mission classified,
for now.
A complete media blackout,
until we have
a greater understanding
of what exactly it is
we're dealing with.
The first step we took was to
provide a cover story to the media
in order to provide a distraction
as part of the media blackout.
In time, we will provide
full disclosure to the media,
but, right now, the space agency
feels that the public
is just not ready to know about
the mission involving the void.
This notion of the...
Space agency's
to send a human astronaut
through to the other side...
It's not going to happen.
Because, physically,
we as human beings
couldn't possibly endure
the extreme stresses
that such a venture
would entail.
For decades,
we've been developing suits
to protect our astronauts
from the dangers of space.
What we're gonna need
to do now to...
To protect our astronauts from travelling
through the void is something...
Quite frankly, I don't think we have
the technological capabilities to do.
As I've implied
a few times before,
sending a human astronaut
would be suicidal.
In order to survive a wormhole,
he or she would have to endure
gravitational waves that would
spaghetti-fy them.
The only feasible,
though problematic, solution
would be to use
robotics or probes.
People all over the world
are reporting
strange activities in the skies.
Civilians from New York,
Australia and Asia
are reporting what can
only be described
as a terrifying distortion
of clouds.
I think they're doing
some kind of project.
Maybe they're testing some
new weather machine.
It was pulsating.
Like, with light kind of.
It just, like... you could see
the clouds moving.
It's really scary.
We're receiving new data
from the void.
We weren't expecting this.
Not so soon.
So over recent weeks,
our orbiting satellites
have been observing the void
and collecting
as much data as possible.
We can see that the void
has been emitting
a series of invisible waves.
And it's this
invisible wavelength
that has been
growing and expanding
at a very, very fast rate.
And we believe
that this activity
occurred at the same time
as the strange dark orbs
that have been appearing
in our skies.
So we have, um, run this
information through
our simulator to predict
its activity
based on what we currently know.
The simulation is
forecasting a storm
of invisible forces,
which could consist of
dark matter and velocity fields
and other unknown fields
and waves
that we know nothing about.
So when this storm reaches us,
our planet will be in the midst
of what could be
a huge cosmic wave.
Since the appearance of
the black orbs in our skies,
each nation's defense department
has declared the situation
as a global security threat.
The defense department reached
out to us in the space agency.
They realized our problem with
sending astronauts through the void.
They believed
they had a solution
and they directed us to their
transhumanism division.
When we learned about
the space agency's problem
of sending astronauts
through the void,
we offered our classified
technologies as a solution,
but, frankly, I don't think
they have an alternative.
Within the defense research
and tech divisions
were classified programs,
and they were taking place within
the areas of neuroscience,
transhumanism and synthetic
biology for advanced soldiers.
Now, you see, these programs
were classified
for the obvious reasons
of ethics
and were definitely not
sanctioned officially
by the government as such.
Particularly,
the human 2.0 program
because the nature
of the technology,
utilizing the fusion
of human cells
with synthetic biochemical
structures
to create a new body powered by
the soldier's preserved brain.
The brain can live
without a body,
but the body can't live
without its brain.
It's that simple notion which
drives the human 2.0 project.
Our aim was to
create a prosthesis
that could house
the human brain,
a substitute body.
But most importantly,
we wanted it to be recognizable
as a human.
Okay, I'm gonna up the back
if you want to have a look.
Okay, so this compartment
here's gonna house the brain.
And you see the red
jell-o-looking substance here?
So that's actually
a coolant gel,
and it travels
throughout the body,
and it houses millions
of tiny fiber optic threads
connecting the brain right down
to all the synthetic muscles,
and even to really
superficial sensors.
But the brain's gonna
sit in here.
And the gel also acts
as a shock absorber,
so should the human 2.0
receive any impact,
the gel will dissipate any force
protecting the brain.
But here let me,
let me show you this.
Okay.
Don't worry, he's not alive.
That's just a synaptic
nerve reflex.
Uh... but a transplant hasn't
been made into this body yet,
so, essentially,
it's just a body.
Um... it's like... a bit like
a computer without a hard drive.
In the recent week, we have
covertly searched the globe
for candidates who are willing
to push the barriers of science.
Now, officially, the selected
candidates will be on a mission
to the international space
station to conduct research.
However, once the transplant
takes place,
they can never return
to the lives they left behind.
Their families will be informed
and will be given
an appropriate explanation
that will, of course, protect the
mission and the space agency.
A closed-casket funeral
will take place
to provide closure
to the families.
Now, for the record, um...
Do you understand the classified
nature of this mission
and the legal non-disclosure
agreements that you sign,
which prohibit you from ever
discussing this projects
to anyone outside of this room?
I understand.
Then you understand
the full nature of this program?
Yes, I'm fully aware.
And what do you feel
your strongest asset is
that'd you be bringing
to this mission?
I'm hoping to bring to this
mission my virology expertise.
Military background,
and in the short time I've been
in the space program,
I have rised the ranks faster
than anyone in the history
of the space program.
But you know this.
It's... it's the unknown.
It's the possibility of
something else out there for us.
Even though there's some...
Pretty scary risks...
To know that there's a chance
to do so much more.
Well, I think it's in our nature
to want to rise
above our limits.
I feel that I want to do
something great, you know?
Like, I want to be like my dad
and be remembered for something.
Sure, I've spent
the great majority of my life
in a chair.
Half of my body does not work,
I do not want sympathy for that.
I have come to terms with that.
I've made my peace with that.
Sure, for...
Also for most of my life,
I have dreamed
of being and doing
something more.
And part of coming to terms
with my situation
is resigning myself
to the fact that that,
that is not something that could
happen, happen for me.
I will not... be...
The person I thought I could be.
What you're doing
right now, sir,
is presenting me with a chance
to fulfill that dream,
that desire.
I have cancer, I...
If my body is limiting me,
then I need to go beyond that.
This is the only way
I can do it.
Are you sure that you're aware
that this is...
A one-way ticket?
We select, not only
on physical prowess,
but also on
the ability to emote,
to... to be empathetic.
Could I go through
with the procedure?
There's just too many ethical
issues to think about.
There would have to be
a massive, massive reason
for me to go ahead
with something like that.
And, uh, I can't think of one.
So, no, couldn't do it.
The subjects would have
to pass a series of tests
as well as internal exams
from our psychologist,
and fitness and medical checks.
The process in itself
is painless.
The subject will be administered
a cocktail of drugs
by I.V. Drips,
which will stop the heart
for a few hours.
Simulating a peaceful death.
The most time-consuming part
is the wiring up, the remapping
of the artificial spinal cords,
connecting to the brain, thus
allowing for mind-body communication
to function,
very much like it does
in each of us.
What you need to
understand is...
It's this fusion process
where the, where the brain
imprints with the synthetic body
and comes together,
that's the creation
of the human 2.0.
That's the marvel.
But we must remember,
these human 2.0s
aren't entirely mortal.
The brain also degenerates
over a period of time.
Now... the difference
being that, unlike humans,
their bodies last much longer,
so the period of life
is extended for much longer,
but not forever.
The vetting process for the human
2.0 program is extremely high.
Basically these candidates
will become ambassadors,
representing the human race
on the other side,
and are selected based on their
extraordinary cognitive abilities.
We only have two synthetics
available for this program,
so the selection process
has been extremely critical.
We've decided to action
the first transplant
before making
the second selection.
For the first transplant,
uh, Carl Roberts.
He's, um, not as academic
perhaps as the other candidates,
but his cognitive skills
are, are...
Beyond our expectations.
When I opened that bit of paper,
it-it...
It contained the information
I wanted it to
and I was accepted.
Man.
Yeah, that is everything
I wanted, man.
I'm... I didn't know if I'd said
everything I needed to say
in that interview.
I can't describe the excitement
I feel right now.
I mean, I'm gonna
get out of this chair.
I'm ready.
Bring it on.
He has a certain hunger
that this requires.
It's that, um...
Sense of adventure that
will drive this mission.
And we're very,
very pleased that, uh,
that he's on board.
Today I'm having
a full-body scan
to allow the human 2.0 body
to be as close to me as
possible, warts and all.
Apparently, the agents think that
if first contact to be made,
then it should be in human form
so that the extraterrestrials
would know what we look like.
It's, uh, it's lucky I'm so
attractive, don't you think?
So the bodyshell is
a breakthrough
in nanomaterial technology.
It's made of
a military-grade grapheme,
so millions of its tiny fibers
are woven to make
the bodyshell impenetrable,
yet it can also maintain
a flexibility,
which is important
for some areas,
uh, such as the joints.
Its eyes use nano-based optics,
which allow the retina to adjust to
several different lighting conditions.
And, yeah, you are
probably wondering why
the human 2.0 is breathing.
Uh, well, this is just
one of the many features
incorporated to help
feel more familiar.
The breathing effect
is actually caused by
a mechanism within
the synthetic body, um,
to help with thermal regulation.
A tight regulation of glucose
and oxygen metabolism
is essential for
brain physiology.
So we developed a compound
called "z02h",
which releases tiny amounts
of electrochems into the brain.
This compound, essentially,
it mimics the properties
of glucose and oxygen,
therefore fueling the brain and
keeping it alive organically.
The original design
of the spacecraft
was intended
for human astronauts,
so we now stripped it bare
of any hardware or technology
needed for life-support systems,
as the 2.0 human group
won't need it,
therefore making it
smaller and lighter,
which means it's faster
and it uses less fuel.
They will be jacked
into the sockets
so that we can monitor
their diagnostics.
But it also means that
we can feed information
directly into their
cerebral cortex.
I mean, that's a remarkable
thing, don't you think?
First contact, of course, is of the
utmost importance, how it's presented.
Concern for us:
What are we communicating to?
What exactly are
we going to discover
when we make contact with a...
Intelligent extraterrestrial
life form?
Are we thinking in terms
of a human?
Um... perhaps a microbe?
It's very, very difficult
for us.
So what we've done is we've put
together a golden archive drive.
This is an upgrade,
it has, um, more visuals,
more sound, videos.
And, uh, well, hopefully,
when we do make first contact,
we will be able to communicate.
And all of the images,
the sounds, uh...
An essence of who we are,
and our intention.
Oh, no, no, no,
it's good, it's good.
I'm all right, sir.
- Thank you.
- There you go.
Vitals look good.
Yes, sir, everything works.
Waist up.
Have you been made aware
of the actual proceeding?
- Come here.
- Thank you.
Have you been made aware
of the procedure?
Uh, I think so.
I think, uh...
Yeah, quite a bit I don't know.
Okay, well, let me take you
through it step by step.
The only level of,
let's say, um...
Un-comfortability that
you might experience is,
just at the very beginning,
we need to make an incision
just around here to be able to
gain access into the spinal cord.
You have to look at this
as a procedure.
Not everything is going to
happen straight away.
The actual time taken will be
right about three days.
Your awareness begins to
fade very slowly,
and your heart rate
will begin to slow down.
As the heart rate slows down,
your level of consciousness
will actually expand,
before then beginning
to come down.
Okay, so I'll just fade,
fade out.
That's one...
That's one of being able to...
I go to sleep.
It's a very peaceful sleep.
- All right.
- A very peaceful sleep.
I guess this is
my last interview
before I transplant
into the new body.
I wanted to...
Go out into space,
and live there forever
among the stars.
And he told me...
That I could do whatever
I wanted to do.
As long as I put my mind to it.
So...
This is for you, dad.
The military have been
doing recon fly-bys
to get a closer look
at the spheres.
Now what's complexing
is that the spheres
don't seem to be reacting to us.
The space agency has convinced
leaders of key nations
not to initiate an attack
without us analyzing the data
to further understand
what the spheres are
and what is their connection
to the void.
Our advanced satellite
geomapping indicates
that the spheres are scattered
across the entire globe.
Although we don't have
an accurate number,
it's estimated that there are
hundreds of these spheres,
floating in our skies,
with more appearing every day.
The geomapping also revealed
a pattern
within the formation
of the spheres.
It's... it's as if
they are aligning themselves
in preparation for something.
At 8:35 this morning,
our first human 2.0 transplant
attempt... failed.
Our subject was pronounced dead.
There will be a second attempt
tonight, I presume.
I'm devastated.
We lost someone who was so
supportive of this mission,
of this... of this cause.
But we're losing time.
We have to launch
within a week, and...
We can't afford
to lose that window.
Carl's transplant revealed that
the brain couldn't fuse
with the synthetic body.
And it rejected it
during the fusion process.
And, pretty much,
scrambled the brain
synapsis badly.
The brain just overloaded.
To prevent another loss,
uh, the idea is to update
the original synthetic
body printing technology
with a new integrated tissue
organ printing system.
Introducing a tiny amount
of the subject's actual cells
into the synthetic gel
means the brain can make
the connection
with something organic
and not freak out
when it comes into contact
with a foreign body structure
it's not used to during
the fusion process.
My professional opinion?
This whole thing
is being rushed.
We need more time.
Uh...
Look, the only way
that this could work,
the... the feasibility of it,
is to ensure that the human
transplant is tested
with the enzyme beforehand.
We would need to test
each candidate.
But this would require
several months.
We don't have months
or even weeks,
we're really up against it.
We have the military human 2.0s,
we should deploy with them.
Sending one military human 2.0
is one thing,
but sending two as a replacement
to our astronauts...
Well, I think you have
to ask yourself,
"do we want soldiers
representing humanity,
especially in that
state of mind?"
And I can confidently tell you
that that is not something
that I am comfortable with.
Thankfully, I have been advised
by my medical science team
that there is
a potential solution
which would fit in
our timeframe.
Ever since our probes have been
sending back samples
from the moon mining missions,
the Mars rover missions,
those samples have been
kept in storage
in the space agency facility.
As protocol,
we take blood samples
and urine samples
of all space agency staff
to monitor any radiation effects
coming from the labs.
And this protocol is, in part,
us keeping our team safe,
but also conforming to science and
technology workplace regulations.
Out of the entire agency,
only three came up with
a positive match for the enzyme.
One is an astronaut who's
just come back from the ISS,
the other is our head of I.T.,
and the other is our
expert cosmologist
on the subject of the void,
Jessica Johnson.
Yeah, can I take your coat?
Oh, yeah, lovely, thanks.
- That's it.
- Yeah, great.
- How's things? How's Mary?
- Good, she's good.
- It's really nice to have her back.
- Oh.
- I haven't seen her for a little while, so...
- Yeah, she...
- Hey!
- Hey, how are you?
Yeah, I'm good.
- A long time.
- I'm laden with a cat.
Yeah. Aw.
So good to see you.
Um, when am I gonna
see you again?
Um, I don't know.
- Soon?
- Um... yeah, soon.
- Sooner than, sooner than...
- Yeah, definitely soon.
- ...this time, okay?
- And I promise,
I will definitely text you back.
Okay. Enjoy the puzzle.
- Good luck. I'll see you.
- I'll be back around 8:00.
Good luck, Mary, take care.
Yeah.
Obviously,
you know why I'm here.
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah.
Um, and to be honest,
I'm having some
reservations myself.
Of course.
I'm coming to you
sort of off the record
- and as a friend more than a colleague. Um...
- Mm.
I respect that and I get that this is
a really difficult decision for you
as much as it is for me,
I know that.
And I... I want to make
the right decision
that I'm better going ahead
with the procedure
- than... my knowledge being here.
- Mm.
But also... there's no way back.
There is no way back.
And...
I'm sorry, but, um...
Excuse me.
I need to make sure my family
are really well cared for.
- That I can guarantee.
- Yeah?
I can guarantee that your family
will be taken care of.
And it needs to...
Be delicate,
the way you tell them.
I will be sensitive.
- Thank you.
- Of course.
You don't need to
worry about that.
This can't be for nothing.
And I'm aware that
we've got one shot at this,
- and time is running out.
- Yes, it is running out.
It's... it's very pressing.
You know, you will go down
in history books
for what you, potentially,
if you agree to do it.
Well, Jessica is faced with
a very difficult decision.
She is the best candidate that
we have at the present time
to participate in
the human 2.0 project.
Of course... it's not
an easy choice to make.
I don't really know...
I really don't know
how to convince her
to make this choice.
I feel terribly conflicted
because we all know that...
Her life will change
irrevocably.
And, uh...
There's no guarantee
that she will, um,
you know, make it out
of this process alive.
It's a very big
responsibility for me.
And it's, uh,
ultimately, up to her.
- I'm going to do it.
- What?
It makes perfect sense.
I know this mission
more than anyone here
and I understand the objective.
I'm the only person here
who understands
what could potentially
be on the other side.
You don't have to do this.
You're much more
valuable to us down here.
Well, given the tight timeframe,
you know that this is
the right thing to do.
Look, we'll have to run tests. And besides,
we have the other two positive candidates.
- What makes you think...?
- The astronaut, James good,
firstly, just back from the ISS,
secondly, he has a family.
And David Jennings in I.T.,
I mean, seriously,
the guy is so defensive.
Definitely not
first contact material.
I've already done the psych test
and I'm cleared
for the procedure.
Now I haven't worked
directly with her,
but in light of
recent communications,
it's clear that she's volatile
and, frankly,
a ticking time bomb.
I don't think we should have
someone like that
lead a scientific investigation
in what could possibly be
the most important discovery
in the history
of space exploration.
She has, um,
this ability to focus
and this attention
that she applies to her work,
which is very impressive.
And she has this
exploratory nature
with veering that she does.
Always looking deeper into ever
anomaly that she's researching,
drawing conclusions
from the data
and, and thinking about things
in a way that's very
valuable and unique.
And, really, I think Jessica's
the ideal person
for this mission.
When Jessica was
making her decision,
she came to me
to find out more about
what it was gonna be like
in the human 2.0 body.
So, obviously, we discussed
the physical differences,
but she was more concerned about
her emotional capabilities.
And I reassured her,
um, you know,
this is the most important
aspect to us;
preserving her
emotional intelligence
and, in a moral compass,
you know, that's what
makes you human.
And it's a human that
we want to send up there.
Well, it's, um,
absolutely incredible
what they can do.
Um, it's very overwhelming.
Um, but Alice was wonderful.
She told me exactly what is
entailed with the procedure.
Um, I know a bit more
about it now.
Um...
It's... it's incredible.
I'm ready.
Um, I absolutely
have to do this.
And, uh, yeah.
The hardest part
of this decision
to go ahead with the procedure
has been calling up
my friends and family
to just hear their voice
one last time.
These phone calls
really made me realize
the sacrifices I'm making.
Even if I do survive it,
I am well aware that
this is a one-way mission
and there is no point of return
to my original life.
The fusion has been successful.
We have our first human 2.0.
We are literally god right now.
When I watched her eyes open,
and when I saw her
take her first breath,
it, uh... it was like
she was reborn.
But it's like you're watching
consciousness come alive
right in front of you.
And this unprecedented mix of,
of human consciousness
and technology.
Okay, guys,
can you check on this?
Okay, Jessica,
just calm down, it's okay.
The speech synthesizer, it needs
the reconfiguration, okay?
But just calm down,
this isn't permanent.
We can fix this, okay?
But try, try and relax yourself.
Uh, so we're having some issues
with the speech synthesizer.
Basically, the electrode
that's implanted in the brain,
which is communicating telemetrically
with the neural decoder,
this is where, I think,
we're having some issues.
We need to do some
reconfiguration here.
Strange hearing my voice.
I don't feel like myself.
But I'm just in a new body.
My... I can feel pressure when
I touch my fingertips together.
But I don't have
any sense of pain.
When I look in the mirror,
I see my old face,
only inside a new body.
Sometimes, when I close my eyes,
I totally forget that I am
in a synthetic body.
Everything which makes me
who I am,
it's in my consciousness.
I'm told that I will have to go
through extensive rehabilitation
to get my brain used to
the synthetic body.
After the first time,
when we lost Carl,
I sometimes doubted
that we'd be here today.
Seeing her now,
alive...
It changes everything.
That's, um, that's so profound.
Sorry, I find it really,
um... staggering.
And I suppose mixed in
with that is, uh...
The fact that she is a woman,
a human being like you and me.
Um...
And she must be wondering how
it's all gonna work out as well.
But I think
she's gonna be just fine.
I would suggest that this is
the beginning of the future
of astronauts to come.
I won't deny the fact
that our human 2.0 solider may
possess certain hardware attributes
within its synthetic body,
which will differ from
the synthetic astronaut.
Yes, he is carrying small arms,
which is part of the human 2.0
soldier body design.
You don't send a soldier
on a mission without a weapon
and considering that we do not
know what is behind the void,
it is inherently dangerous
to be unprepared.
Human 2.0 has just docked on
and looking good.
Prepare for launch countdown.
Five, four, three, two, one.
We have ignition, engines start.
Lift off.
Power is nominal.
Engines at 101% and nominal.
Altitude is 2,000 feet
and climbing.
Avionics power is at nominal.
Altitude is at 10,000 feet
and climbing.
Engines remain nominal.
Preparing for main engine
cut off.
Two minutes to EPOS.
Sequence 30 seconds.
Speed, 7,200 miles per hour.
Stand by for stage one
and EPOS separation.
ESS is disabled and we have
stage one separation.
Payload separation
in three, two, one.
Eject.
Alignment and trajectory
is looking good.
We still have good, strong
telemetry in the RCC.
Standing by
for human 2.0 connection
in three, two, one.
Jessica, we see
what you see, over.
Please commence
on observation report.
Pressure stable inside
the craft.
It's all looking good.
Jessica, you are a go.
Engaging on board
trajectory system.
We're getting closer.
We're approaching the void.
I can almost see it.
It's almost within range.
There it is, there's the void.
Wow. It is beautiful.
Be advised,
we are no longer receiving
craft telepatry.
As we get closer,
I can feel everything around me.
It's starting to move too.
Oh, the pressure's so strong.
Pressure readings are fluctuating.
It's becoming irregular.
There's a strange light coming
in from all around, up ahead.
Oh, wow, this is incredible.
Especially since the void is
starting to distort everything.
Here we go!
We are losing your transmission.
If you can still hear us,
good luck and godspeed, Jessica.
Well, we don't know, uh,
exactly when we can expect
our astronauts to return.
Um, we can only
speculate and hope,
and I hope that they will be
back, you know, within the year,
but it's possible that it could
take several years,
several decades even.
And there is also the remote
possibility that we...
May never hear from them.
Uh, we're prepared for
every eventuality.
We're tracking them right now.
And, um, well, as you can see,
we're all working flat out,
keeping tabs on what's going on.
And everybody is listening,
every single second.
There's been an accident.
And...
I'm afraid that Jessica
has been involved.
There was, um, an explosion...
On the rocket and...
I'm really sorry to say, but...
We've lost her.
Everything that's dangerous,
must be...
And why was she on it?
It's her job.
Couldn't they have put
someone else on the rocket?
No, darling.
No.
Yeah, that was tough,
my goodness.
Uh...
Oh, it's all very complicated
I've never lied to my daughter
about anything before.
And, um, of course, the last time
I had to tell her somebody died,
it was my husband.
Um, and it's not pleasant to
have to go through that again.
I knew that, um...
Well, if she could know
the truth and if she knew why
she would forgive me.
That's hard.
This morning, one of our defense
ballistic missile radar systems
picked up a...
A fast-moving object
heading towards
the Atlantic ocean.
We use this to
track space debris,
uh, satellites.
This object, it has
the same size, velocity,
trajectory as the craft that
we sent through to the void.
I mean, we were awe struck,
that's for sure.
I mean...
Within a few days
of launching, um...
To return so quickly...
Well, when we arrived, we lifted
the craft out of the water
and I remember smearing black
residue off the side.
Well, usually, when you see a
craft with that amount of aging,
you would expect that the craft had
been out for a long period of time
and had a very forcible entry
back into the atmosphere.
From my experience
from previous missions,
what would happen is that
you would enter the craft
and there'd be
two astronauts there.
But in this case, the military
astronaut was nowhere to be found.
We need to consider
the fact that perhaps
that this whole void...
Is a Trojan horse.
That...
That this could be perhaps
a message, a warning.
I don't think it's a failure
that it's come back
in seven days.
I mean, we have something
that has been through the void
and come back.
Now our next step
is to start doing tests.
As standard protocol
for all our astronauts,
we have to keep miss Johnson
in quarantine
to prevent any form of
biological contamination
she may have been exposed to.
We have to prepare ourselves
for the fact that
the mission is a failure.
What we need to do now is
get ready for next steps.
To be honest, whether she wakes
up is another thing.
She may physically wake up now,
or even next week, or next year.
When a patient has suffered
severe brain damage,
then... they go into a coma
or vegetative state.
It's possible that
the sustained injury
is impairing their normal
brain function.
When we plugged her
into the transcode bay,
we discovered that the recorded
data in her brain
showed several years-worth
of new memories recorded.
Yet she had only
been away for five days.
It's possible, even probable,
that the time on the void
is well different
from our concept of time.
What is a couple of years
the other side
may well just be
a few days here.
The transcode process works by
tapping into the connector
where the memories are stored.
This is made possible by artificial
intelligent chip implants
that's stored
at the side of the brain.
So this helps us encode memories
and also stores them
as synaptic connections.
What our transcode
technology does
is it unscrambles this chain
of synaptic connections
into a stream of data.
Our software then processes
this stream of data as imagery.
So when played back,
it's.. It's incredible.
It's actual memory footage.
We've transcoded
bursts of memory.
And, although short,
it's very promising,
in fact, it's... I think it's
better than anybody expected.
Um, at this stage
of the game, however,
it... they are short because
it's very, uh, taxing mentally
for Jessica.
So she needs
a certain amount of time
to recover for the synapses
in her brain
to recover from the experience
that she's had
to, sort of,
re-gather, as it were,
um, and then we start again.
So, for me,
there's a priority, obviously,
which is to
take care of Jessica.
I certainly don't want
the information that she has
to be compromised in any way
by pushing this process
too quickly.
However, there is an imperative that we
get the information as soon as possible.
We have some very worried people
here at strategic defense committee.
With the heightened
activity in our skies,
national security alert
was elevated to code red.
Now bear in mind, we have
protocols set in place
for this kind of event.
Since the '40s.
Something must've triggered
her brain synapse like a switch.
Her brain activity
lit up like fireworks.
Her diagnostics were normal.
Nothing seemed damaged.
Well, her brain did
have a level of trauma,
but that's to be expected,
and her memories will
take a while to reconnect.
Despite my professional advice
to the space agency officials,
not enough time was given
to allow for her recovery.
There were too many questions.
And everyone wanted answers.
Jessica, I'm gonna
ask you some questions
and it's very important
that you answer them
as clearly as possible
so that we can prevent confusion
with the memory transcodes.
I understand.
What do you remember
from the launch?
It was so much light.
I remember thinking
to myself that
this light is going to blind me
if I keep my eyes open.
Can you tell me what happened
with the soldier 2.0?
The solider... he remained quiet
as we went into the void.
But as the light flashes
became more violent,
I... I couldn't watch him, I had
to close my eyes for a moment.
And when I opened my eyes,
I noticed
that he was no longer
in the craft.
I looked outside and I could
see him floating away.
Jessica, sorry,
can you confirm that again?
I said, there was no way that he
could've left the craft via the hatch.
He just floated there
as if frozen.
He had a look of fear
in his eyes
and he kept looking down
at his arm.
His arm exploded into
a white flash of light,
which looked like
a nuclear bomb detonation.
And then the craft began
spinning out of the void
and towards what
looked like a planet.
I must've passed out because
I then found myself
on the planet's surface and
had no idea how that happened.
I kept walking and walking.
It was as if I was drawn to
a specific location.
Jessica,
did you make first contact?
Yes.
I saw them.
But they had no shape or form.
I felt their presence as if they
were trying to communicate with me.
And there was a flash,
and I found myself inside
a white environment.
In the distance...
Was something approaching me.
I felt paralyzed.
I-I just couldn't move.
I know I should've been
scared or terrified
but I wasn't.
I actually felt calm.
It was Jim Marcell.
But he didn't physically speak.
I could hear him,
though, in my head,
telling me that everything
is going to be okay.
What are their intentions?
He kept saying
it's going to be okay
and that our time has come.
It was strange,
I could feel what it was saying.
It-it...
it wasn't a voice as such.
It was just information being
presented into my mind.
Many in the committee
are questioning
the validity of
Jessica's memory transcodes,
in particular, the appearance
of astronaut Jim Marcell.
Um, they are questioning whether this
is a manifestation of her imagination
or a kind of mirage,
if you will.
However, I have to wonder why
he appeared in the first place.
And, to me, I think
it's important to, perhaps,
examine the idea that
astronaut Jim Marcell
is alive and well,
and on the other side
of the void.
He's not damaged in body
or mind, seemingly.
So perhaps this would indicate
that their intentions towards us
are positive and that
they mean us no harm.
We have to be extremely cautious
in our response
to Jessica's statements.
We have to run...
A whole lot of tests
to ascertain whether
or not she's suffering
from any form of
post-traumatic stress.
She's been through one
hell of an experience.
It's bound to have
some side effects,
even if they are temporary.
We have a lot at stake here.
And we can't afford to make any
rash conclusions at this stage
about what the transcodes are
and where they come from.
Are they really Jessica's
own organic memories?
Or are they imposed,
placed there,
by someone or something else?
This is ISS, be advised
of incoming debris.
The blowback does not look good.
Multiple collisions with our
outer-orbit satellites
and the debris speed is
accelerating rapidly.
It's heading right at us.
Standing by for collision
avoidance maneuver.
100 meters and closing.
75 meters and closing.
50 meters and closing.
25 meters and closing.
Ten meters and closing.
Five meters and closing.
Three meters.
Brace for impact.
We were so wrong.
We could not have been
more wrong about...
All of this.
We were so blinded
by our own paranoia
that we couldn't see
what was really going on.
We thought that
we were being attacked.
It didn't occur to us
in our wildest dreams
that actually
we were being saved.
That thought
never crossed my mind.
And I am feeling...
Uh, humbled I think
is the word that comes to mind.
And... um, you know,
you see something,
I guess you can't help but
question everything that you...
You think you know.
Breaking news, today,
not matter which race,
religion or political view
you hold,
or wars which you are fighting,
everyone on this planet
is witnessing
a historical event,
which experts are calling the
cosmic event of our lifetime.
Since the event, Jessica's mind
is less constricted
and more memories
have been transcoded.
The more we've transcoded,
the more we've learned about
Jessica's first
contact experience with them
and their intentions.
He said that this
is all part of the cycle.
A process created by them
to keep the universe stable
and working.
I had to ask, "why us?
Why did they save us?"
Whatever they
learned about us...
Perhaps made them decide
that we were a species
worth preserving after all.
Regardless of our flaws.
He said their work is done
and, in time, they will return.
I never thought that
the gad would've played
such an important part
in saving humanity.
We designed it to inform
extraterrestrial intelligent life
if they bothered reading it.
Uh...
It happened, they did.
Human beings,
when faced with the unknown,
there's an immediate reaction
to go on the offense.
You have two choices really:
Fight or flight.
That was our mindset.
Of course,
having the military involved,
that's going to be part of how
we approach these things.
And I think from early days,
you know,
since the beginning
of this discovery,
we gradually entered
onto that path
of feeling that
we were under threat.
And I have to say it never
really crossed our minds
for one single second
that there was something out
there that was helping us.
Now, I don't know why that
didn't occur to us,
but maybe it's a question
we need to ask ourselves.
Is everything
that we don't understand,
is it something to be feared
right off the bat
as a knee-jerk reaction,
or is there space that we can
make to contemplate
that there could be
forces out there
that really are on our side,
and that are part of
helping us evolve?
Nothing...
We thought we knew
about physics, science...
About intelligent life,
nothing that we've theorized
could ever have
prepared us for this.
There's no physical,
scientific explanation for this
or why it happened.
Although the scientists and other
members of the space agency
are overwhelmed by this event,
the defense department can't
help but ask the question
about these aliens.
Is it in their best interest...
If the human race survives?
Every astronaut is fitted
with a tracking device.
So, in the early hours
of this morning,
the military honed in
on a tracking signal
that was consistent
with the device
carried by astronaut
Jim Marcell.
They found him wandering around
in a state of complete shock
in the Arizona desert.
And, um, we have no idea
how he got there.
I think maybe
we can assume that,
now that the void
has disappeared,
his role as a conduit
is no longer necessary.
Unfortunately, um, Jim Marcell
has no recollection
of what happened to him
on the other side of the void.
And he will need some time to
come to terms with recent events.
We really have no idea
what he experienced on
the other side of the void.
Since the disappearance
of the void
and the black spheres, we've
been noticing a lot of strange
and fascinating activity
above our planet.
An aftermath of recent events.
This swirling cloud of gas,
and dust and ice
could be seen producing
what appeared to be planets
and their moons being pulled
down into their own gravity.
It's now looking like
we have a new solar system.
The fact that
it's actually happened,
unsettling on, sort of,
the deepest level
because it throws into question
every single thing
that I and my colleagues
have learned about our earth,
our solar system,
space and beyond.
What resulted was the formation
of a new planet...
Right next to ours.
Like a sister planet
directly in our orbit.
Our unmanned probes performed
atmosphere and surface scans.
And the resulting data indicated
that this new planet
has all of the ingredients
required to sustain human life.
From surface temperature,
to magnetic field,
water, oxygen.
It was as though this planet
was custom-built just for us.
This new planet and its mass,
it's almost identical
to our planet.
With a 10% variation in size.
That's why we're starting to
refer to it as "earth two."
Future world populations
predicted to soar
above 12 billion
and resources are running out,
it's impossible to
accurately determine
how long we'll actually
sustain life here.
So when a mission
like this comes along,
leaders of the world's nations
will pay any cost to be part of this.
The arrival of earth two
has set off
what can only be described
as a 21st century gold rush.
Corporations
and governments alike
are quickly
positioning themselves,
and their country's interests,
for our new neighboring planet.
The U.N. Has called upon
all leaders from key nations
to come together to discuss
interplanetary strategies,
which include the use
of nuclear power
to assist in colonization.
Meanwhile,
people all over the world
are taking to social media
to express their hopes,
thoughts and concerns.
Earth two is a chance
to build a new life.
What I'd like to know is
who is making those decisions?
Rich and politicians,
they can't be the one
to make this decision about
our children's future hope.
I mean, what if there is
life on the new earth?
I mean, what are we gonna see?
What are we gonna find
when we get up there?
We're gonna absolutely
destroy that planet.
Because the governments
are corrupt.
We should go to earth two
because that way
they can stay here
and they can continue to fight.
I don't buy it.
I think this is
a mining operation
for minerals and resources.
This discovery changed
everything we know
about the universe
and about ourselves.
Not like democracy
exists anyway, right?
But we should vote on the kind of
people that we want to send there.
The very best scientists,
the very best artists,
the very best philosophers,
and people that actually
think and care about humanity.
Well, this occurrence has
opened up the Pandora's box
of whys.
There's also a whole host
of-of...
Other complicated questions.
Specifically, how do we proceed?
It's been 12 months
since we last saw the void.
Yet I have this sure feeling,
they haven't really left us.
And, if anything,
they're still observing us.
Today, we are sending
the first manned spacecrafts
to earth two.
The space agency decided that
we send only human 2.0s first
with the intention of
running tests on earth two
in order to lay down
the foundations
for when the time is right
to commence sending humans
to settle down
and colonize for
future generations.
But one does wonder whether
we will make the same mistakes
we've been making for centuries.
How can we ensure this new home
brings out the best in us?
Or how we, and our
future generations,
don't make the same mistakes
we did in our past,
and prove that our existence
was worth saving.
We were so obsessed
with discovering new life
when, on reflection,
we have still yet
to discover ourselves.
We now have another chance
to do just that.
