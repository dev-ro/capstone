Yes, who is it?
Benjamin,
Angelo's brother.
I sent a telegram.
Hello!
I'm Miranda, your sister-in-law.
Well, sort of.
Never had a sister-in-law before.
Lucky me.
What should I
call you? Benjamin?
Bennie is good.
Are you in the Navy, Bennie?
No, I work on a cruise ship,
Infinity Lines.
I'm a waiter, sort of.
You are much younger
than I thought.
I will celebrate 18 on Sunday.
In three days!
I'll throw a party.
Great.
Let me see if he is awake.
Because he has a hard time
to stay asleep, you know?
Tetro.
Are you awake?
Your brother is here.
I was just a little kid when he
went on his writing sabbatical.
It was the last time I saw him.
I'm so happy to see you, Bennie...
and to meet you and all that, but ...
He really doesn't want to
know his family any more.
Guess he's about.
No. He wants me to go in.
But you can stay here tonight.
Thank you.
You know, he's really...
I don't want  it to have
your feelings hurt.
Good night, sweet.
Rest.
"I promise you that I'll come back
and get you."
"Love, your brother Angelo"
What the fuck happened?
I walked into a bus.
She get your coffee?
No, I just woke up.
She's been really nice.
I hate nice.
Especially the word.
I hate the word nice.
Are you okay?
What happened, Bennie?
You're getting a fight with
the Great One?
I ran away from military school.
Escaped from prison, more like it.
Tell me about it.
Dad does not know where I am.
I got this job because
I knew how to wear a uniform.
I lied about my age.
Just took off.
Yes.
Just like you.
Come on, baby.
Good morning.
Look how beautiful
my baby is.
Look at that face.
Doesn't she look like Ava Gardner
with the hair like that?
Who is Ava Gardner?
I'm surprised to hear from you, Bennie.
Well, that boat had
an engine malfunction.
It will take about four
or five days to fix it.
So, you're working on a ship, huh?
Come on.
Well, just... I'm a waiter,
but caught that travel bug...
...through you.
Through me!
Well, let's hope that's all
you caught, then.
You remember when you moved in
the attic and you had all those maps?
Remember that? With Tahiti and
Pacific and Pitcairn Island?
So, they are fixing
the engine on the boat, right?
- Yes.
- So you can still sleep on the boat?
You can stay with us.
Why not, Tetro?
It's only one week.
Let's go out and show him the Boca.
Okay, let's go for a walk.
- Go ahead, put on pants on.
- Okay.
Little Bennie...
Able body seaman.
I'm not even a waiter.
Not even ...
- Take Bennie in the shower and I'll be
ready in 10 minutes. - Miranda.
Just me and him, OK?
Sure.
Of course.
Listen.
You stay one week, okay?
When your boat sails, you're on it.
Sure. Thanks, Angie.
Angie is dead.
My name is Tetro.
- Hello, Tetro!
- Good morning.
- How are you?
- Whats up?
Sit here.
- Hello, Tetro, how are you?
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Silvana!
- Okay?
- This is my friend Benjamin.
Well, my friend too.
How are you?
Now come, yes.
How come you say I am
your friend and not your brother?
Do you speak Spanish?
Enough to understand that.
People around here
don't know much about me.
Miranda doesn't even know
who our father is.
I'd like to keep it that way.
I don't care. Yes.
- What? -It's just gonna be the
tough holding on a conversation...
if I can't ask any questions.
Who wants a conversation?
Not me.
Excuse me.
- Pasta flora, specially for Tetro.
- Thank you.
Medias lunas.
Ready...
Milk.
- Please.
- Yes, I'm coming.
So why did you come?
I don't like questions.
Hey ...
don't do me.
Do you, I'll do me, okay?
It's just... it's not fair.
You left and never came
back and got me.
And I didn't get but an explanation.
And you're my brother?
- We shall set sail on Tuesday at 2 PM.
- Okay.
Don't forget to call in.
- Hey, Bennie.
- Hello, Anica.
So you've survived
four of that accidents?
And one more,
with his mother before that.
You know we have different mothers.
His died in a car accident.
Yes, but ...
Tell me about your mother.
- About mine?
- Yes.
She's been in a coma for nine years.
We are going to have
some good things this week.
A family needs to have as much fun
as they can get, don't you think?
Jose, you son of a bitch!
I'm the son of a bitch?
Look at who is talking ...
Son of a bitch!
No, no ... is Armani!
It's Armani, I'll kill you.
- No, please, I beg you.
- I want to see you play cool now!
It is Giorgio Armani.
I'll kill you, bitch.
- Anna, no! No!
- You can kill me.
- I do not want to know!
- Why are you doing this?
I do not care!
This shit does not matter!
Now you will see!
Actually they are
very much in love.
That's love?
Did you ever sleep with a girl?
What? No.
Okay, what else? I've been waiting, yes.
Three hours, yes, already. Yeah, a kiss.
Abelardo Vaca Castex, calls the "cocoa"
and leases the pub. What do you think?
How could he do that?
What can I do? Hermano closed
our business. You know how it goes.
What am I to do? Excuse me ...
Yes .. Ship to Mexico ...
I'm waiting for you, Dad.
- José!
- What is the problem?
No, wait!
You know how how expensive that guitar is?
I dont care!
No. ..!
My guitar!
Unbelieveable!
What position more tempting ...
We were undoing a lot
of things.
That's Abelardo Vaca Castex,
- Abelardo, these are my friends...
- ...founder...
Tetro illuminates
your show.
- It would be good to take it from there ...
- Let's get it out ...
- Put the poster.
- Let's see ...
Tetro is one of the best
illuminators of Elmo La Boca.
Look, how beautiful.
Excuse me.
- Okay.
- Let's close this ...
- Magnificent!
- Perfect!
- We are in business!
- We are in...

Well, Bennie, would you like
for your birthday? Tell me.
Just this. Being here with you
and. .. with Tetro, here.
You know? There are Tetro's ..
I don't remember.
How do you say... this...
Cast.
Tetro's cast is coming off today.
I bet he'll be back to his old self.
Can't wait...
What's that like?
You can't imagine.
Full of interesting things,
you know, brilliant...
Also, he has one part...
Well, more of a one part
that he's got lately. Of course.
Are you married?
As if I were.
- Hello.
- Hello, Jose.
But what I'm seeing.
Look at my love.
The doctor said I can walk
without my cane very carefully.
- Easy.
- No problem.
- He broke it again!
- My leg!
- You're alright, right!? Easy...
- Miranda's kiss.
- Miracle.
- Miranda's kiss.
The miracle cure.
She fixed me right up.
One kiss and it's perfect.
Fixed me!
What were you doing?
Dancing for Bennie?
Just doing my workout.
Dressed like that?
- As always.
- Your workout?
Asshole!
Okay ...
I need to return the car
to my father.
- Take care!
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
- Good luck to you.
All the best.
Bye, Bennie.
Thanks, Jose.
Sorry to intrude, Miranda.
Bye.
So you call him your
brother and me your friend?
What is that?
Would you like to go back to the boat,
Bennie? Sleep on your hammock?
You can just say it,
"brother".
Brother.
Okay?
Yes, thanks.
Happy to have my cast off.
Have you yet start
your work again?
My work?
- Your writing.
-I don't have a pencil.
- Where you were on this...
- I don't have pencil.
I am a writer too.
What do you write about?
I walked away from that.
How do you walk away from your work?
Doesn't it follow you?
So what was it about?
It's about brothers.
Yeah, and?
One brother,
a prodigy in music...
and the older brother,
also a great musician.
Theme's ancient.
The rivalry.
You're writing the story of our father.
One brother goes to New York City
and becomes a big star...
and does nothing to help
the older brother,
who taught him everything he knew.
Uncle Alfie?
On the candy?
Uncle Alfie.
Yes... Uncle Alfie.
You know what?
I'm breaking my own rules.
What rules? What about your mother?
She was like this famous singer,
I know, and she died,
but no one ever told me
anything about it.
Bennie, we
had an agreement.
What agreement?
What about my mom?
Listen,
I divorced myself from
my family, OK?
Fathers, sisters...
all of it.
All of it. Alright?
I do not want to talk about it.
That's it.
Don't you love them?
Yes, I love them.
You know what love does
in the family like ours, Bennie?
It's a quick stab in the heart.
I knew your mother died
in a car accident,
but it's just that I never knew
that you were driving the car.
Well, now you know.
She didn't tell me, Tetro.
Wait! She didn't tell me!
Thanks a lot, Miranda.
She didn't tell me, Tetro.
I ...
Tetro, Miranda didn't tell me
anything. I figured it out by myself.
I only have a few days more.
Maybe I should just move
back on the boat.
What is with him?
He's like a genius, but...
without enough accomplishment.
You know?
That's why his behavior is like this.
A day is ... And another day
he's completely an asshole.
You sound like a doctor.
I'm a doctor.
When I met him, was his doctor
in the asylum.
Asylum?
What kind of asylum?
It was called La Colifata.
 Welcome to "La Colifata"!
Viva! </ I>
 Straight Edge, "La Colifata "...</ i>
 LT 22, Radio La Colifata "</ i>
We did  radio for one hour
a week on Saturday. </ i>
 "Onward, O people, the rescue"
( "Avanti popolo, alla riscossa") </ i>
 "red flag!"
( "bandiera rossa, bandiera rossa !")</ i>
 "Onward, O people, the rescue"
( "Avanti popolo, alla riscossa") </ i>
 "red flag will triumph"
( "bandiera rossa trionfo .")</ i>
I came from Europe to Argentina
to study with the founder
of La Colifata,
who realized that
whoever had the microphone
finally had found
someone to listen.
 "And with you the thoughts of
our dear Cláudia Alessandra ..."</ i>
Well ...
I am very grateful for
the opportunity
for this presentation.
 that is much bigger than I am ...</ i>
 I'm just a grain of sand on
beach that is "La Colifata" </ i>
 A drop of water in the ocean
of "La Colifata "...</ i>
 Unlike you, I do not
want to give my opinion </ i>
 Why you are the worst people
I met across this planet! </ i>
 No! No! No!
No. .. </ i>
What is your name and
why are you here?
Do not want to talk to the microphone ...
- Why don't you want to talk?
--Because I don't want to talk into a microphone!
I just wanted to thank
this station from my heart.
He said he was a writer
and he held everything he had written
against his chest.
It was the only copy that existed.
That is where I met him.
Then finally he said...
 "My name is Tetro..."</ i>
 I want to talk about my father, </ i>
 my father was a lover without love. </ i>
A poet without a poem,
was a failure!
He could not act as a father.
My father worked in
an estate
selling houses where we lived.
We had no money.
I robbed,
pharmacies
warehouses...
You were arrested?
I had a gun.
Did you use it?
A toy gun.
Nothing you said is true.
My father is  ...</ i>
 a real son of a bitch. </ i>
My father could be very mean
and very violent.
He could hit hard.
Then I did...
I did unforgivable...
crazier than my crazies patients...
I fell in love with him.
"He was the older brother
But Alfredo,
the dear, sweet Uncle Alfie
was summoned downtown
by The Great One,
like a schoolboy who has done something wrong. "
It's not a big production.
Rigoletto, down and dirty.
Small orchestra, rented scene...
But if it goes bad,
the newspapers will call it
the shit Tetrocini Rigoletto.
It won't be a shit Rigoletto.
Alfie, why don't you just
conduct under another name?
You want me to change my name?
Thank you.
Yes.
I had the Tetrocini name before you did.
Shit!
What are you doing, Bennie?
Sitting there?
I'm just sitting.
Just sitting?
Just sitting.
- Hello!
- Hello, Ana.
What's up Tetro?
Jose is driving me crazy.
I'm going to visit an uncle in
Punta Del Este.
I have spoken with Miranda.
- It 's okay.
- Right.
- Yes...
- All right.
You are very kind. Thank you.
Jose told me that if not ...
... he would cook and eat
with the poor.
- Okay?
- Yes.
No problem.
- Problem, that's how it's called, Problem.
- Yes?
Yes.
Give him a kiss.
Thanks, bye.
Bye.
Bye Ana.
Hello.
Hello.
Happy birthday, Bennie.
I bet you always wanted a puppy.
Tetrocini family came to this
country in the year 1901.
The first Benjamin made great
in a hosehold chicken business.
But he liked to sing
and he played the mandolin.
Mr. Shakespeare,
what is free verse?
Something that doesn't rhyme.
- What else?
- It has...
no fixed number of syllables.
You know, everything that I love, that
I'm interested in, I picked up from you.
You were the one who took me
everywhere and show me books
and strange movies.
And "The red Shoes".
You thought "The Red Shoes"
were strange ?
What about Tales of Hoffman,
Coppelia, the dancing doll?
Yes, The Tales of Hoffman
always reminds me of you.
Love,
what is love?
Love is...
nothing.

It's Bennie's birthday.
Happy birthday, Bennie.
How are you?
Hello.
You're going the festival of Patagonia?
Yes, whenever possible
I am going.
Well, I gotta go.
But you just came?
I have to test the machine
to see if it fits.
- Do not go falling in love with the place.
- Happy birthday, kid.
Bye, thank you!
- I knew a song of that name once.
- Really?
You know why he's in
such a jolly mood?
I don't really know.
Maria Luisa ...
The cockroach ...
It is "La Cucaracha".
Because my boat's leaving,
with me on it.
No, no, no.
He's excited because tomorrow
he runs the lights.
He loves to do that. He becomes...
The Phantom of the Opera.
Sorry!
Do not touch the door.
I love the settlements,
balances
the changing seasons,
burning ...
And standing offer!
Welcome to the world of Fausta!
You came for something else.
Shall I take this?
To turn up?
A few seconds.
Go back to your world red
with envy and glory!
- I lose memory?
- Be young and wise!
How many guests?
- Hello!
- How are you?
I was invited by Abelardo Vaca.
No, you have to pay.
No. .. you have to pay.
It's 10 pesos.
- It is a work of art!
- I came because I was invited!
- Get in!
- Thanks.
What I want is clear ...
Your soul!
Not a bad deal ...
I want all of yours!
Hallelujah!
How alive is the life!
The future welcomes you!
It's my aunt.
The future welcomes you!
To be young is to be naked.
Youth is naked!
Soon the time talks!
Alas ...
What beautiful thing.
And it is better than the preachers.
Take it off!
Silence!
Silence!
I am the author, damn it!
Silence!
I am Abelardo Castex Vaca, the author.
Abelardo Vaca Castex.
God ...
Oh, what a waste!
- It is critique now?
- Abelardo!
Why, I don't see anyone.
Only the one who failed with the light.
This time this
light is the truth.
The truth?
This light is a shit!
Set the tone, please.
Come here.
My dear ...
Josephine!
Come here!
Tetro, what are you doing?
Please look at me.
I'm crying.
Okay, okay, okay.
Please!
What are you doing? I'll kill you!
Bastard!
Come here!
Josephine!
Firm flesh!
Silky hair ...
Legs hard!
Tits hard!
Touch my flesh and feel ...
What penetrating aroma ...
And it's not content ...
Mercy!
What vulgar woman!
It's Chanel No. 5.
Please!
Chanel No. 5?
Come on.
What is this?
These lines are a disaster!
You do not understand!
Because I speak Castilian ...
Abelardo, what you said is not
important. This language is dead!
Go fuck yourself!
Come with me.
Okay... Come...
Come on.
Down!
Son of a bitch!
Do not throw that chair!
Son of a bitch!
Abelardo ...
Welcome back, Alone.
Who is it?
Ladies and Gentlemen,
is a pleasure to have
her here with us.
Alone.
Welcome back, Alone.
I understand here is being
presented a new work in verse.
Fausta.
- Yes.
- Correct?
Yes.
"Faust" as a woman.
It's fun, you will like it.
For me it is very funny.
A woman ...
But let the play continue.
It will be an honor for us.
Come on, boys, come on!
At your posts!
Careful with that!
Come!
His clothes, Josefina!
Come!
- It is important!
- Come on!
Come!
- Caio!
- Coming!
Josefina, hurry up!
- It is a disaster, a disgrace!
- Hurry up!
- All...
- The accordion, please.
Mrs. Alone, champagne?
Who is that?
That's the most important critic
and writer in South America.
She uses the pen name "Alone".
She runs The Patagonia
Festival, you know.
Here, we ...
See ...
She was your brother's
teacher and mentor until...
Until what?
Until she turned against him, you know.
There are many different stories why.
No one knows the truth.
Let  </ i>
It is a mystery.
- Let's get this!
- To </ i>
Like the mystery of your father
and who he really is.
"Carlo Tetrocini comes from
Genovese ancestors
who emigrated to
Argentina in 1901.
He was was discovered by
Austrian conductor Erich Kleiber,
who took him to Berlin.
He is one of world's great
symphonic conductors.
Carlo Tetrocini is Tetro's father?
It's our last name.
"Tetrocini has conducted
Metropolitan Philharmonic Orchestra
New York for 35 years."
Three decades and a half.
How did this get into my home?
Your father is Carlos Tetrocini?
Of course, how didn't I notice that?
But you told me in "La Colifata"
that your father was...
...a failed writer.
- Remember?
- This was me ...
I told you many stories.
But you said money was
always a problem,
even made you to robberies!
Money was a problem.
He had money, I didn't.
Okay, let's read on.
"His wife, the acclaimed soprano
Angela Panzara, was tragically killed
in an automobile accident.
- He remarried several times ... "
- OK, enough.
I'll be at the other insane asylum.
I need a break
to clear my head.
How could you do this to me?
How could you do that, huh?
How could you do it me?
You broke our oath.
I never made any oath,
I never agreed.
You make rules an it doesn't
mean I have to follow.
I make rules for my own house, Bennie.
This is my house.
-These rules are only for my house.
- It's just a little house
- It's not that you rule the kingdom.
- It's my house and my business.
Our family
is our business.
Why don't you call your boat, Ben?
Why don't you call them up?
'Cause I think they all miss you over there.
Every boat needs a little rat on it.
So why don't you call them up and see if they want you back?
Hello, I'm calling because
my brother's an asshole.
I'm the asshole now?
I'm the asshole?
Good move, good turnaround.
I'm going back to my boat.
Go back to your ship.
Good idea.
You're real good.
But I just want you to hear
something first.
You want me to hear your confession of all those sneaky things
you've done behind my back?
"Dear Bennie:
I am sorry to to be writing
and that's not be able to tell you in person ...".
- No...
- Hey, I don't want to hear that.
"I'm going away for a little while...
but I promise you that I will come back...".
Read it for yourself.
Why? Because you remember
writing it? Do you remember this?
OK,  you're running away now, you're
running away from your own writing.
"I promise you that I will come
back and get you.
I know things are very hard
sometimes in our family.
"I need to go away for a little while
on a writing sabbatical...
I do not want to hear it. Go.
- Get out.
- "I want to do something with my life.
"Someday you'll understand.
You're very young now, but someday
you'll understand. I promise
that I'll come back and get you.
Love,...
"Love...
"Love, your brother...
Angelo ".
"Love,
"your brother Angelo."
"X does whatever he can to avoid
the topic. But one summer day,
trailing behind C
on the beach,
X brings the news to his father. "
Dad ... I don't want
to continue with pre-med.
If not pre-med, then what?
Philosophy.
How do you make a living of philosophy?
I want to be a novelist.
Novelist? Writer?
Yes, that's what I want to do.
Well, to make a living as a writer,
you have to be a genius.
So?
There is only room for one genius
in this family.
Amalia, listen to me.
I do not want to hear from anybody
family any more. That's all.
OK? I'm just asking you
to stay out of my life.
That's all I'm asking.
That's all I'm asking, OK? Very simple,
just stay out of my life. Okay?
- Angie, we love you. Pop loves you.
- Yeah, but don't love me, OK?
Be my sister but don't love me.
- Don't say that, I don't want
to hear that.  - You know what?
Let's blame me.
I'm a bad person, okay?
Why don't you just go on to the
sabbatical, do your writing and...
- ...just with our blessing?
-I dont' want to talk to my father,
...I do not want to talk to
anybody from the family ever again.
Papa will send you the money.
All the money you need.
I'm getting off the phone now.
Good-bye.
Again! Sorry!
Let's start again.
Letter Q.
Good!
Monday, eleven o'clock.
So,
you're going on a sabbatical.
To write?
One of these checks
will arrive wherever you go,
every three months.
I expect you to cut out this nonsense
about Bennie once and for all.
For your own sake,
someday you will understand.
Go, go on this sabbatical...
to write ...
or to find yourself.
And when you go on this
writing sabbatical, Angelo,
what will you write about?
I said, what will you write about?
This.
Dammit, Bennie!
What did you do?
What is this?
Please ...
What is this?
Bennie, how could you do this?
What if he walks in?
I fell asleep.
Yes, I see that you were asleep.
You can't be careless
and have him find you like this.
You haven't seen him really blow.
It's all backwards and in code.
Maybe you should tell him you
have this and ask his permission?
Here. How did you find this?
- How?
- It was accident.
An accident?
Yes.
An accident.
Alright.
