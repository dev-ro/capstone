"SACHY, WE DEDICATE THIS MOVIE
TO YOUR EVERLASTING MEMORIES."
-GOLD COIN MOTION PICTURES
IN MEMORY OF ANIL NEDUMANGAD
IN MEMORY OF RAHUL RAVI
What we witnessed was beautiful.
But what we're about to witness
is even more beautiful.
I am talking about the final battle…
of the 16th All Kerala
Tug-of-War Competition
organized by the Areekkara Club.
We have thousands of
tug-of-war lovers here…
cheering, celebrating and focusing
their utmost attention on the game.
{\an8}The winner is going to get the most
attractive game prize offered in Kerala.
It includes Rs. 88,888
and a full-grown goat.
A best of three battle is about to happen
between the teams who have
won each set as equal forces.
Who will win the golden cup today?
Who will cross the centerline first?
Fourteen champion players
are here to battle it out.
Come on, clap for them!
The score is 1-1.
President.
Come on, write it in
the police team's name.
Yeah. The second prize, right?
Do you want to bet?
Let those boys win the cup, man.
Which boys?
Aren't you ashamed
to support Praveen's team?
Why should I be ashamed?
He's a policeman.
Ask him to play for the police team.
It's been only two years since
he joined the police force.
He's been playing for Kings
since he was really young.
Okay, stop it. That's enough. Come on.
-How do you feel?
-Better.
Hey, move.
If anyone from our team gets
hurt, we will take care of him.
-You needn't intervene!
-Calm down.
-Move!
-But I didn't see anyone here.
What are you mumbling?
-What did I do, sir?
-You're not a physiotherapist.
Let it go. Don't mind him.
He's creating a scene for no reason.
Don't bother about him.
Sports lovers,
our dear candidate, Miss Betty Jose,
is visiting the playground.
Welcome her with a big round of applause.
We need your applause
and cheers for this battle.
On one side, we have
Ernakulam District Police Rural,
who have defeated their
well-equipped opponents…
with their brains and brawn,
and won the cup for the last two years.
And on the other side…
Why did you do that?
{\an8}…shocking those who
had written them off,
the dark horses of this
tournament, Kings Piravom.
After the final battle, who will kiss
the cup? Who will embrace the cup?
We will find out in a few minutes.
Come on, clap for them!
A warm welcome to our dear
Superintendent of Police, Mr. Rajendran,
who has come here to hand
over the prizes to the winners.
Will he be able to present
the cup to his own team?
Let's wait and watch!
Keep cheering for the teams!
{\an8}The playground is full of
excitement and fervor.
{\an8}Fourteen champion players…
{\an8}are about to begin their battle.
Team, ready?
Ready?
Start!
Come on, clap for them.
The battleground is about
to witness some tense moments.
{\an8}Who will cross the centerline first?
Searching for the answer,
here are Praveen Michael and team!
Come on, clap for them!
{\an8}The rope is swaying. With the fervor
of applause from the sports lovers,
without any intention to lose,
and with the speed of a cheetah,
fourteen champion players
are battling it out.
Praveen Michael and team…
are inching towards victory.
-Pull it!
-Come on, clap for them!
Pull it!
With the speed of a cheetah
and the precision of a vulture,
both the teams are
building a strong defense.
{\an8}By understanding the opponents' skills…
{\an8}and exploiting their weaknesses,
who will march towards victory?
{\an8}Seems like it's going to be Praveen
Michael and team! Clap for them!
{\an8}Will Kings Piravom cross the final
ten feet and emerge victorious?
Come on, cheer for them!
With thunderous applause
from their supporters,
Praveen Michael and team
are inching towards victory.
Clap for them!
{\an8}And Kings Piravom has won the game!
Defeating the mighty Kerala Police…
the dark horses of this
year, Kings Piravom!
Kings Piravom!
Clap for them!
They've offered a memorable
game for the audience out here.
A battle that has rewritten history.
This amazing performance
was displayed by…
Kings Piravom!
Around 68 champion teams…
from 14 districts had
participated in this competition
conducted by the Areekkara Club,
Areekkara.
Defeating those 67 teams,
the warriors of Kings Piravom
have won the first prize.
And they have become the champions
of this competition.
Mr. Praveen!
You know the drill.
I don't have to explain, do I?
It's a postal vote.
Here's your mother's election slip.
I know you'll vote for us,
but I'm just reminding you again.
Just give us the postal ballot.
We'll do it.
I haven't got it yet.
-Oh.
-How is your mother doing?
She's fine. She's resting inside.
Do you need a car to bring your
mother to vote on election day?
-No, I'll manage. Thanks.
-Okay, then.
Bye.
Hey, Praveen!
Why aren't you dressed yet?
How can you be so lazy when you
have to go meet a prospective bride?
I have had enough of it.
You're getting late!
Go and get ready!
I'll do the rest!
-I--
-Go!
I'm going!
Auntie, look!
She posted this photo yesterday.
And this one, in the morning.
Look. She posted this one
just five minutes back.
-She is having a blast there.
-Dad, look at this.
Why does he have to get
depressed thinking about her?
What can I do, dear?
-He doesn't listen to me.
-Dad, hold this.
Hey! Come here!
What are you doing?
-Hey--
-Please don't play with it!
I can barely handle your
dad playing with it!
-Come here.
-Why are you scolding the child?
Our husbands won't come home
until we marry off Praveen.
That's why I'm taking all this trouble.
-Hey, see you at the club in the evening.
-Okay.
Are you going to meet
the girl dressed like this?
Praveen! Hey!
Where are you going now?
They are waiting for you!
DySP has summoned me.
I'll lose my job if I don't go.
Ask them if they'd get their
daughter married to a jobless guy.
If they are okay with that,
then it's alright.
Okay, dude.
I'd told you, right?
How are we supposed to go
to that girl's house now?
Enough.
Prepare tea for me.
Which doctor are you consulting now?
How did you land up in front of the SP
when you were on medical
leave for your back pain?
He gave us the trophy yesterday.
Do you know what he said to me?
He asked me to refer you to the
medical board and get you fired.
I have gotten you exempted from that.
For your father's sake.
Your local station duty is due, right?
Go get your passport from
the camp and join there.
Can you operate a computer?
-No, sir.
-No one admits it even if they can.
We've exhausted the
additional quota for diesel.
If we've caught some tipper motortruck
without a pass, get them to fill it.
He's new. Tell him about his duties.
Okay, sir.
-Sir, will you be going out?
-No.
Then, may I take the jeep?
I've got information about an LP
case accused. I'll go and check.
The driver is out on
permission until noon.
Do you at least know how to drive?
Yes, sir. I have the authorization.
Charge a couple of suo motu
cases on the way.
Okay, sir.
Who all are there in your family?
Just my mother.
You might have known my father, sir.
He was an ASI.
He died eight years ago in an accident
while he was posted at Ramapuram Station.
Oh, yes! Mr. R. K. Michael!
Oh! You are Mr. R. K. Michael's son!
His initials were not R. K.
but his last name was Michael. Yes.
Yes, right!
He had a paunch, a bald head…
and eyes that almost popped out.
His eyes were full of rage.
Mr. Michael!
We used to call him "R. K."
Your father was the one who trained us.
-Time flies so quickly, right?
-33 mobile, respond!
33 mobile answering.
Location, Panambukad!
Remember, you have to pay
attention to this set.
Stop here.
You can go.
Don't go alone, sir. I'll come with you.
I haven't come here to catch a culprit.
I forgot my bike here
last night as I was drunk.
Don't tell this to anyone.
Get going. I'll see you later.
Okay, sir.
Stop!
Please register your valuable
votes for Betty Jose here.
Mom!
I'm okay. I just got into the car.
I'm coming to the station.
If you want to file a complaint, you'll--
No, sir. I'm a policewoman.
You're late today, Sunitha.
Namaste, sir. I was on outdoor duty today.
She's our girl.
See you at the station.
Ask them to come to the station.
I'll give them the money.
And ask the workers to keep
the cement sacks covered.
I had sent it.
Got it?
Okay.
-Mom, I've arrived at the station.
-Plant those properly.
See if you can get
some cow dung for this.
Apply cow dung all around it
once you finish planting them.
Yes, sir.
Hey!
This isn't the police camp.
You don't have to salute
me every time you see me.
Sir!
Sir, the writer is calling you.
Newcomers have to give
the seniors a treat.
Next Friday, the breakfast
after the parade will be on you.
-Okay. We'll make it grand.
-Platoon, attention!
Platoon, stand at ease!
Father, has your assault
case been compromised?
Don't hit people so roughly or
else, they'd die.
-What grade are you studying in?
-Eleventh.
Does your family know about this?
-What's your name?
-Albert.
How can you trust guys like him?
You're not even an adult yet.
-Where does your dad work?
-He works abroad.
What were you both doing in the car?
Do your parents spend money
on your education for this?
Look at her face!
What happened?
She was roaming around with
this guy during her free period.
One of the members informed me.
-What's your name?
-Albert.
-Where do you stay?
-Pala.
-Louder!
-Pala!
-Is there any case in your name?
-No, sir.
What's your name?
Krishnapriya.
Inform their families.
-Give me your parents' number.
-It's 97…
-97?
-466…
I will be late.
Go to the clinic, Mom.
I'll join you there.
The number you're calling…
Mr. Maniyan… we're collecting
money for Mr. Babu's son's wedding.
The Director General has
issued a new order…
that says we should go on
a trip to reduce our stress.
They won't make us do yoga, right?
I hope we get the day off.
Maniyan, DySP has said that no one can go
home until the pending files are closed.
If you have too many of
those, you're doomed!
Get lost, you idiot!
What is this?
POLICE
Take that girl to the women's cell.
Get away from her!
Step aside, girl.
If you're on driver duty,
you should be near the car.
I had gone to the toilet, sir.
Is this the time to shit?
Stop near that black gate.
What are you doing? Only three
days are left for the competition.
Is this how you're going to dance?
Show it to her.
Do you remember the first step?
One…
She must win this time.
I have spent a lot of money.
I can get her three A grades.
But the first, second, and third
prizes are decided by the judges.
You're a cop.
Come on, use your influence.
Start from where you went wrong.
I don't think it's possible.
-Where is your phone?
-I am leaving.
-I've been calling you for so long.
-It must be lying there somewhere.
I must know my daughter's whereabouts!
I'd told you yesterday that she has
a holiday today. You must have forgotten.
Haven't I told you not to leave
her alone with her teacher?
You don't know the kinds of things
that are happening out there.
Half your problems would be solved
if you get rid of this uniform.
Do you want some?
How many times do I have to tell you?
Raise your elbow!
Praveen!
Come here!
It's okay. I'll wait here.
Come. Have some jackfruit.
She's won all these prizes.
This one at the district level.
This one is for the Atham competition.
It's the State Youth Festival
day after tomorrow. Have a seat.
She's competing in three categories.
Story narration, folk
dance, and monodrama.
She will win this time.
The election's also around the corner.
If my leave is not sanctioned,
I'll take medical leave.
Hey!
Come here.
This is our artist.
Perform your monodrama for Uncle.
-Now?
-Yes.
"Grandma!
Grandma!
Why do we have to sell our
ancestral house, temple, and farms
to buy a new apartment?
Grandma, can't you tell my
father not to sell all this?"
"Oh! My dear!
My children don't obey me anymore.
-On the contrary,
-Hello, sir!
-I have to obey all of you.
-I'll be there right away.
I'm left with no other option.
I can't advise…"
33 mobile, please respond.
Mobile 33 answering.
We're waiting at the boundary.
It's clear.
Roger.
Sir, mic one will be here soon.
Get in quickly.
Hey! Don't assign me any
duties for the next two days!
Got it?
I have to attend
the association's meeting.
If the government falls
after this by-election,
it'll be a hell lot of work for us.
It won't fall, sir.
The Chief Minister is
running the campaign, right?
Too bad that the CM didn't
give a seat to Joshy Mathew.
He was always with him
working really hard.
How can the CM take any risk
when the seats are at 69-70?
Instead, if he gives that chance
to a dead person's daughter,
he will get sympathy!
Praveen, yours is a postal vote, right?
Praveen, last time when
he went with my ballot,
he promised to get me
transferred to vigilance.
I'm having a great time
in vigilance now, aren't I?
Don't forget the name,
Advocate G. Raveendranath.
Why did you go to their house at night?
It was her birthday, sir.
I'd gone to give her a gift.
You could've done that during the day.
I'm sorry, sir.
Praveen.
What's the issue, sir?
We've got an order from the authorities
to kill that boy we met at the station.
He'd gone to his girlfriend's house
last night to give her a gift.
And that girl is related to a minister.
I've been asked to book him
with a non-bailable offense.
Even goons have the freedom
to accept or reject such orders…
but we don't.
-I just talked to your superintendent.
-Oh.
First room from here.
Let the bottle remain here.
John M. Thomas, son of Thomas,
of Palaykkal House…
situated in Piravom of Arakkunnam village
has given this statement
on 19th November 2019
to Maniyan KP of Piravom Police Station.
"As part of a property dispute,
22-year-old Arun, son of Shekharan,
of Attumangalath House,
had threatened to kill me.
Last night, i.e.
on the night of 18th November 2019,
after all of us went to sleep,
he broke into our house…
poured petrol all over
the place and set it on fire.
Had we not extinguished the fire quickly,
we would have been dead by now.
He's still sending us such death threats,
so I humbly request you to take
strict actions against him."
I have read the statement and signed it.
Okay.
Your mother is inside.
Her creatinine level has increased
quite a bit. I think it's because…
she has been taking medicines
for arthritis for years.
I'll give a reference letter to
a nephrologist at Amritha Hospital.
I have also booked an appointment
for the day after tomorrow.
You must go there without fail and
start the treatment immediately.
-She has suffered so much.
-You should make her understand.
She's coming. Talk to her directly.
Okay, then.
-Bye.
-Bye.
They're here to talk about Biju.
Go inside, Mom.
What is it, brother?
Why did you report this
at the station, dear?
What other option did I have?
You're doing all this
because I am helpless, right?
I'm struggling so much to complete
the construction of this house.
Please don't trouble me.
You know how he is, right?
He's crazy. Later don't say
that we didn't warn you.
I'll handle it, brother.
Go inside, Mom!
I've told you not to talk to
these people unnecessarily.
Don't worry about that, sir.
She liked it, right? Then, buy that one.
Don't worry about the price.
We can do that.
Yes.
Okay.
Yes.
-Sir!
-Wait a second.
The CI has asked us to issue
a memo to latecomers.
There'd been an accident in front of
the hospital and he's really angry.
Go quickly.
-I was going to ask him for leave.
-Go. You'll get it right away.
Yes, sir.
Okay, then.
Don't look at them, Mom!
You should go home, Mom.
There are workers at home, right?
-I will talk to the CI. Don't worry.
-Okay.
Go.
Yeah, I'll be there.
Hey!
How dare you spit on that wall!
This is a police station!
Why are you getting angry, sir?
-Let it go, sir.
-Should I wipe it?
-Wipe it.
-Alright.
Just wipe it!
-You're messing with me?
-Sir! Leave it, sir!
-Let it go, sir.
-Come, sir.
Don't you dare leave without wiping it!
-Let it go, sir.
-Just wipe it.
-I'll make him do it, sir.
-Come, sir.
-Wipe it!
-Come, sir.
-Wipe it!
-I'll make him do it.
-I'll make him wipe it.
-You won't leave without wiping it!
Let it go, sir.
-Come, sir.
-Move!
Please, sir.
-You won't leave without wiping it!
-I will do it.
I will do it. Please, sir.
What happened, sir?
He's my relative, sir.
He keeps harassing me.
I'd asked the Circle
Inspector to talk to him.
Tomorrow onward,
all those who are on traffic duty
must get to the duty point on time!
Or else I'll get you all fired!
I'm the one who has to suffer
because of your damn mistakes!
-Where are you going?
-Hello!
-You'll be called.
-I said I can't do it!
-What?
-I need leave for three days.
It's the election.
I can't grant you leave.
I have to take my mother
to the hospital tomorrow.
All the ministers are holding conventions
here from today, including the CM.
I need to provide force for all that
and you want me to grant you leave!
Sir, there's no one else
at home to take her there.
Don't trouble me now! Get lost, idiot!
If you can't grant me leave, say that.
You don't have to abuse me.
Anyway, it's urgent.
-So, I'll take medical leave.
-I'll see how you take medical leave!
I'll get you fired!
Get lost!
Sir, give me that phone.
Bow down and get it.
We don't bow down anymore, sir.
It's a thing of the past.
You won't leave until I get my phone.
What is this, sir?
-Let him go, sir.
-I'll punch your face, you idiot!
If you touch me, you'll lose your job!
-What about me?
-Stop it!
You…
come here! I'll not spare you!
-Lock him inside!
-Let go of me!
Let go of him!
Let go of him, sir!
You'll have to pay for it!
Let go of him!
-Move!
-We won't spare you!
-What's happening here?
-Sir, he hit me! He's drunk as well!
Take him for a medical checkup
and book him under PDPP!
Where's the paper?
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!
-If you hurt our boy,
-If you hurt our boy,
we will barge into your
house and kill you!
-Scram, all of you!
-Hey!
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!
-Move the gun away!
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!
What's your name?
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!
-Hey, Mr. Maniyan!
I'll fill in the details, sir.
Getting back at me, are you?
He'll learn once he goes
to jail for six months.
Why wait for six months, sir?
Let's settle this right here! Come!
Let's do it!
Please get here quickly, brother!
Biju is getting beaten
up at the police station!
But I wasn't the one who started it.
Whatever it is, the situation
in here has become chaotic now.
What have you done, sir?
If you were the GD,
would you have let this happen?
If the public comes to know about
this, I'll lose my job!
The CI said he'll charge a case!
What's your problem?
You arrested that guy just based
on Sunitha's oral complaint!
What else was I supposed to do?
Quietly let him hit our officer?
Chacko, release him!
Sir!
Sir, he's drunk and we have beaten him.
If we release him without a medical
checkup, we'll be in trouble.
What can I do?
The SP asked me to release him!
He's saying that it's a caste vote issue
or some damn thing like that!
Why did I have to quit
my job at the school!
Hey! You are free to go.
What did Rameshettan say?
Let him come first.
We'll decide after that.
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!
-Hail CPDS!
Okay.
Let me see if something can be done.
I'll try to figure something out.
Okay.
Okay, thanks.
I'll call you later. Bye.
They've got themselves
admitted to a hospital.
I hope they don't gather people
and start a police station siege.
He has joined just now.
But you've been in service for 20 years,
right? Can't you show some maturity?
-Apologize to them and sort it out!
-It wasn't a deliberate action, sir.
Our biggest problem is that we
released him without a medical checkup.
That's true.
If we lose our jobs because of
this, no one will help us.
I have talked to Mr. Mathew.
It'll be taken care of, sir.
He is your relative, right?
Capitalize on that.
Let's go.
Vote for Betty Jose!
Yeah.
I'll be there after attending
the program in Attingal.
We'll decide once I am back.
Yeah.
-Switch off your phone.
-Yeah.
I already told you, right?
That's enough!
As far as I know,
this election is very crucial.
Ask your boys not to host a protest
march or a police station siege for this.
But the boys have taken
this issue very seriously.
So?
Well, in the current situation…
we should promise something good for
our community just to pacify them.
That engineering college in Attachira…
we've been asking for it
for so many years, sir.
If you could do something…
then I would think about
it after the election.
Alright.
I trust you, sir.
And sir…
once the election is over,
please get those troublesome
police officers suspended.
Bye, sir.
I am here at the hospital.
No, it's alright. I'll deal with it, sir.
I'll call you later. Bye.
Sir is here.
-What is it?
-This is the video I shot.
Send it to me.
This shouldn't be leaked at any cost.
Once the police record your statements
tomorrow, all of you leave from here.
-Got it?
-Okay.
I just met the Chief Minister.
If we don't create any problem
until the election is over,
we'll get the college and the land.
We don't need the college
or any damn thing!
Hey!
-Keep quiet.
-What?
Don't create a scene here!
When I was beaten like a dog at
the police station, no one did anything!
I will get back at all of them!
The association won't be responsible
for your drunk or stoned debauchery!
-He's just agitated--
-Got it?
-Let it go, man.
-Let it go.
Hey, we'll go together to the wedding.
I'm not coming, sir.
Fine.
Bye. See you tomorrow.
Are you still thinking
about that incident?
Cops who do their job honestly
always end up getting in trouble.
Others are awarded the Good Service Entry.
I have talked to Mr. Mathew.
He will sort it out.
You don't need to worry.
But sir, I'm not invited.
What?
There's only one invitation
for the entire police station.
You don't know who it is, right?
It's Mr. Babu.
He used to be very close to your dad.
He'll be very happy to see you.
Let's go have a couple of drinks. Come.
You don't need to drive today.
Come!
The story of an octopus
Slashed by the knife of envy
It turns like toddy
-It seems like a grand function.
-Hey, you eight-legged…
Come, let's have food.
No, I have to call the travel agents.
Don't worry about the ticket. Come.
No, I have to call my
friends before I leave.
Okay, come once you're done.
He's going to the Middle East tomorrow.
-Where in the Middle East?
-Saudi Arabia.
By the way, I don't drive after drinking.
-He'll drive then.
-His wife stole the sweet toddy
And the backwaters turned red
-Hey, you eight-legged drunk octopus
-We're leaving. I've got the pilot duty.
Drop Sunitha off at the
station when you leave.
-Okay, sir.
-She's having food.
Hey!
Take your mother to the hospital
and get back to work at night.
Thank you, sir.
This is Mr. R. K. Michael's son.
I used to visit your
house when you were young.
Nice to meet you.
While climbing up the coconut palm
The knife glitters
And his wife grins in his dreams
Come on! Have a drink!
He doesn't give two hoots about her
He chops her into pieces
Until the knife's sharpness wanes
-Oh, my dear octopus
-Oh, my dear octopus
-Watch your step, you're drunk
-Watch your step, you're drunk
Sunitha… we'll go together!
-Drink up!
-Laugh all you want!
-Until you have an upset stomach
-And your head spins
-Pour yourself…
-A lot of toddies
-A jar full of toddy
-My dearest
The toddy of moonshine
The knife glitters
And his wife grins in his dreams
The way he chopped her into pieces
May I chop you into pieces?
-Crawling
-Slipping and swaying
-Along the pavement
-Before the idol
-Throw up
-If you want to
-Drink up!
-The sour buttermilk
The toddy of moonshine
Hey, you eight-legged drunk octopus
You, who stole the toddy of the moonshine
-Hey, do you know?
-Hey, do you know?
Once he chopped her into pieces
Using his knife
-His wife stole the sweet toddy
-His wife stole the sweet toddy
And the backwaters turned red
The knife glitters
And his wife grins in his dreams
Get me one more drink.
It was Mr. Babu's longtime
wish to get his son married.
When he was in service,
he used to talk only about that.
Today, his wish finally came true.
Sunitha…
you should also get married as
soon as your house is built.
Don't delay it.
And you as well.
I'll get married after
I get back from the Middle East.
What?
I'll get married only after
I'm back from the Middle East.
I wasn't talking to you.
I meant you, Praveen.
Don't grow old like this.
-You heard me, right?
-Yes.
Your mother will be really happy.
Even you should have a family.
You still have a lot of time, boy!
We'd have a grand wedding
once you get back from there.
There's nothing like
having our own family.
Hey! Stop near that ATM!
Withdraw Rs. 20,000 and keep it with you.
-There's no need, Uncle.
-Come on!
You have to buy the ticket, right?
It's a gift from me! Take it!
The pin is 5858.
Go.
I couldn't refuse when he compelled me.
Yeah… I'll be there in half an hour.
Okay. I'll call you later. Bye.
When are you leaving?
I've got the visa.
If I pay the money tomorrow,
I can vote on Saturday
and fly after that.
Yeah, go! There's no point
in staying here anyway!
Hey!
Sir!
-He is alive.
-Hey!
-Hey!
-Hey!
-Hey!
-Hey!
Sir, this is Jayan.
Which Jayan?
Biju, who caused a commotion at
the station, it's his friend.
Praveen, let's go.
-This will get us in trouble! Come!
-Sir, he's alive!
-Lift him, sir!
-Come on!
Lift him!
Dude, it's Maniyan! Let's go!
We'll get in trouble!
Lift him!
Open it. Quickly.
Open it! Hey, come and help us!
He is throwing up.
Hey!
Praveen, start the car.
Sir.
Hold him.
Suresh, get the stretcher!
-Hold him.
-Hey!
Come on.
Is it an accident case?
Yes.
-Sister, connect the monitor.
-Yes, doctor.
It was our car.
When did this happen?
About half an hour back.
Have you boozed?
I have to inform the police.
It's a medicolegal case.
We're the local police officers.
We've informed our station.
You can inform his relatives then.
The patient was brought dead.
What is this?
What happened? What is this, doctor?
Hey, Biju!
Come here quickly!
It's Jayan! Those idiots dumped him here!
Run quickly!
Catch them!
Open the door!
Sujith, go through the other side!
Quickly!
Hello! Sir, it's me, Praveen!
-What is it?
-We--
There is one problem.
Are you at the station?
We're coming there.
-Yes, I am at the station.
-Okay.
-Get here quickly.
-Okay, sir.
Is she asleep?
I'll be there in half an hour.
Sir, he was alive when
we took him to the car.
I get that… but would
anyone else believe you?
Moreover, you had consumed alcohol.
Sir, my nephew was driving.
He hadn't boozed.
Where is he then?
No one has seen him.
Even if we charge a case against him,
people will say that we fabricated it.
Don't worry.
We'll figure something out.
Sir!
All three of them are here, sir.
None of them were driving, sir.
Sir.
-Hello?
-Mr. Maniyan.
This is Joshy Mathew.
Leave from there immediately.
The Chief Minister…
What is it, sir?
Hello?
Mr. Maniyan, this is Joshy Mathew.
Leave from there immediately.
The CM has asked the superintendent
to charge a case against you all.
DALIT YOUTH DIES IN A CAR ACCIDENT
THE CAR WAS DRIVEN BY
DRUNK POLICE OFFICERS
Maniyan, do you have a cigarette?
-Don't you want to light it?
-Yes.
-Sir!
-Come here!
Sir, what are you doing?
Come on!
-Come!
-Sir!
Come here quickly!
-Let go of me!
-Don't do this, sir! Let go of him!
Close it.
-Start the car!
-Sir, come here quickly!
Maniyan!
Hey!
Maniyan, stop!
-Sir!
-What happened?
They have escaped, sir!
The number you're calling
is either switched off or--
Who is it?
It's uncle, Mom.
Get me some water.
I'll make tea for you.
-Who is it?
-It's me.
I was in this area for work.
Is your daughter's
dance competition over?
It's tomorrow.
It's in Thrissur, right?
Yes.
Where is Rahul?
He'd gone out with you, right?
He came back after that,
took his bag, and left.
What happened?
What is it?
Is there a problem?
What is it?
The number you're calling is either
switched off or not reachable.
What happened, sir?
The number you're calling is either
switched off or not reachable.
Please try again later.
Start the car!
The number you're calling
is either switched off or…
The number you're calling
is either switched off or--
Sir!
Where are we going, sir?
The number you're calling is either--
If we don't find Rahul,
we'll get trapped, sir.
He's not at home and his phone is
switched off! What should I do?
Even if we find him, what if he
doesn't admit that he was driving?
Can't we tell the superintendent
that he was driving?
Yeah, right! Go, tell him that!
You'll learn your lesson
when you're remanded!
But sir, how can they book
us without any evidence?
Just shut up!
We're in this mess because of you!
This is not the time to play
the blame game, sir.
What's wrong with what I said?
What do you even know?
What are you going to do then?
Nonsense!
I've been doing this
for about 20 years now.
Let me tell you what's
going to happen now!
An accused was harassed at
the police station for a personal grudge
upon a policewoman's complaint!
All of this was filmed by a person
whom we killed in a car accident.
Then we took him to the hospital
to frame it as an accidental death.
Isn't this enough for them
to book us for a homicide?
Sir, we are police officers.
Why would we be held as the culprits?
Police, my foot!
The guy who died was a Dalit, like me.
The by-election is
just around the corner.
This government can win only
if they get those votes.
So, they will definitely
declare us as the culprits.
Got it?
Please drop me off at home, sir.
We need to get away from here
until the election is over.
And we should disprove the case
framed against us at the High Court
with the evidence we have with us.
We'll only be acquitted if
the CBI investigates this case.
I want to go home, sir.
Yeah, alright!
Drop her off at home!
What? Start the car!
Hey!
-Hey, stop!
-Sir!
Sir!
Get in!
Get the car!
Quickly!
Hey! Everything's alright!
No! I am fine!
There has been a small problem!
I'll solve it and come home!
Go to sleep, okay?
No!
Don't cry! You'll scare our child!
Hang up!
Three police officers, ASI Maniyan KP,
WCPO Sunitha Krishnan,
and CPO Praveen Michael, who are
the culprits in a murder case…
have escaped in a mobile unit
vehicle from the Piravom Station.
It's a white Bolero.
Its number is KL01AQ1233.
There's a special
instruction from Tiger…
to take this vehicle and the culprits
into custody immediately.
Note the names of the culprits once again.
ASI Maniyan KP, WCPO Sunitha Krishnan,
and CPO Praveen Michael.
If you feel this message is not
clear, contact Tiger.
Throw away your SIM cards!
I lost my phone at the hospital, sir.
From what we know so far,
the culprits are police officers.
A murder case has been
charged against them.
The government will always stand
by the departed young man's family.
During this election,
what's the government--
The Election Model Code
of Conduct is in force,
so I can't say anything further.
We've got to know that
the culprits escaped
with the help from the local police,
so the investigation has been
handed over to the crime branch.
Ma'am, I was in the toilet
when they escaped.
Only an aged ASI and a lady constable
were present at the station then.
Look, they are police officers.
Stop waiting for them
to switch on their phones
and try to locate the station
mobile unit they took.
They must have left it somewhere.
As soon as you find the vehicle,
do a tower dump of the nearest tower
and get me all the details. Got it?
Okay.
Ma'am, none of them were driving
when the accident happened.
Then, why did you charge them with 302?
The superintendent asked me to do that.
Why are you useless people
roaming around in this uniform?
-You are the reason why--
-Stop it!
You're going to see
a bishop tomorrow, right?
-Yes.
-You may leave now.
You can go on leave for six months.
Sir.
Sir, those three police
officers escaped because
of the call ASI Maniyan
received on his phone.
It was from Mr. Joshy Mathew.
He had called him from
a migrant worker's phone.
Joshy Mathew?
He's the youth wing
president of your party, sir.
-Why had he called him?
-It could be personal or political.
We can find out only if we question him.
I will handle him.
No one else needs to know about this.
The media, to be more specific.
Also, show this smartness only
while catching the culprits. Got it?
Sir.
Come on!
Hey!
-What are you doing here?
-I'd stopped to pee, sir.
In the middle of the road?
What's in the vehicle?
I'm on my way to get it loaded, sir.
Get going!
Was he hiding anything, sir?
No, there were just empty sacks.
Come on, let's go.
Sir…
Yes, sir.
We are checking all the vehicles.
Stop!
Pull over.
I have a friend in Udumalpet.
We cannot take that route.
There will be strict checking
at all the checkpoints.
What happened?
It's the police.
Hey! Why did you stop here?
-Sorry?
-What?
Turn it off!
-What's in the vehicle?
-Nothing, sir. I'm going to get it loaded.
-Hey!
-What?
Pull over…
and show me the vehicle's documents!
Go!
Why did you stop there?
For no particular reason, sir.
-What's in the vehicle?
-It's empty, sir.
-I've checked it.
-It's empty.
Go!
You may go!
Get going!
Go!
Hey… go!
Pull over!
Proper checking is happening
on all the routes, right?
Inform us immediately if
you get any information.
Wait a second.
Ma'am, the service history details of
those officers and the other details…
of their friends and relatives have
been collected from the SP office.
Okay, that's great.
Ma'am, we've asked the cyber
cell to monitor the numbers
of people who have frequently called them.
-What about the vehicle?
-The local police are looking for it.
As soon as they get any
information, they'll contact you.
Okay.
The last information we got about them
was that they were seen at Sunitha's
house at 11:30 p.m. right?
What's the maximum distance they
can cover in two and a half hours?
-About 150 kilometers, right?
-Yes, ma'am.
Strict checking is taking place on
the Kottayam, Ernakulam, and Moovattupuzha
routes. So, they won't take those routes.
But they might go to Idukki.
Checking is not that
strict there at night.
Or they might just be here… right?
-Hello!
-Yes?
Ma'am, we've found the vehicle.
When we did a nearby tower dump,
it showed that Praveen made
a call from someone's phone here.
They left with Praveen's friend Hakkim.
-Hakkim's phone is switched off now.
-Okay.
Get the details of the vehicle
that was used to escape.
Check all the CCTV footage to
find out about the route.
-Okay, ma'am.
-Got it?
Yes.
Mom has to be taken
to the hospital tomorrow.
-Make some arrangement--
-Hey!
-I'll get it done.
-Get going!
Whom will you send?
-Either Sudhi or I will go.
-Hey!
Just go!
Why were you stopping him?
The police must have identified
him and his vehicle by now!
They will be here any moment!
Are you both here to attend a wedding?
Sir…
what's the plan now?
What plan? Do you have a plan?
Tell me!
I'd warned you not to
take him to the hospital!
Now don't do anything stupid!
Just do as I say!
-What stupidity are you talking about?
-Sir!
-What do you--
-Sir!
-Don't fight, sir--
-Move!
We are in this mess because of you!
I got trapped in this while helping you!
What nonsense!
You hit him because you were pissed
at him. Did I ask you to help me?
Of course, you'll say this!
-You are just like your father!
-Sir!
If you curse my father,
I won't consider your age, mind you!
What will you do?
-What will you do?
-You idiot…
Hey! Sir, please don't fight!
-Move!
-Sir!
What's your problem?
Hey! You imbecile!
Are you blind?
You had to jump in front of my vehicle?
Hey! You idiot!
Brother, three cups of tea, please.
I've just opened the shop.
It will take five minutes.
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.
Okay.
Brother, do you have a phone?
My calls are not going through.
Hello, sister. It's me, Sunitha.
Auntie!
Your daughter had called.
She is fine.
She's told me to tell you not to worry.
Don't be upset.
Whatever information you
get, let me know.
Could you track the number?
Okay.
Upon arriving in Munnar,
I want to meet the van's driver
and the person from whose phone
they made the call. Got it?
Call Munnar Station
and ask them to be alert.
Okay?
12 mobile.
12 mobile control.
12 mobile.
-Hello?
-Is this mobile located in Munnar?
Okay, sir.
12 mobile control.
12 mobile answering.
There's urgent instruction.
Three police officers who are the culprits
in a 302 case have arrived in Munnar.
Do a thorough check
of the town and surroundings.
The message is clear.
Sir!
Wake up, sir!
Sir, we've got a message
that the police officers
who escaped from Piravom
have arrived in Munnar.
We shall go there and check.
-Or else we'll be in trouble.
-Okay.
The sea of life
Is searching for another shore
Destiny is far away
Like a funeral pyre
-Shadows are eating up all the light
-Shadows are eating up all the light
-Termites are covering the entire body
-Termites are covering the entire body
Those times of the past
This journey
Is turning dark
The hunter
Is right behind us
Searching for the prey
Hey, what is this?
Why didn't you wash the vessels?
I am paying you! What more do you want?
Oh, really?
Two cups of tea.
Didn't you wear it today?
This one!
Here. Go and wear it.
Chenduvarai, anyone?
-The vehicle is here. Let's go.
-Coming!
Come quickly!
-Wait, I am coming!
-Hurry up!
Hey, old man! Come!
-Coming!
-Come quickly!
-Hey!
-Let's go!
The State School Youth Festival
had a colorful start in Thrissur.
The festival began with
a grand procession--
{\an8}Violence erupted during
the protest against
{\an8}Jayan's murder in Ernakulam district.
{\an8}There's no information
so far about the three
accused police officers, Maniyan
KP, Praveen Michael, and Sunitha.
Those who helped them escape--
-How much for one cup of tea?
-Ten rupees.
-How much for two?
-Twenty rupees.
Give us water!
Come on!
Come!
Come on!
Who are you?
Sir!
It's you!
How are you?
Who are they?
Hey, these are our people! Shut up!
I need help, Moorthy.
What happened, sir?
Tell me! I'll do anything for you!
This is the SP's daughter.
He has eloped with her.
I had to intervene in this issue.
Police are looking for us.
We need to stay here for two days.
Two days?
You can stay here for two years!
But we don't have many facilities here.
There are sacks lying inside.
That's the only problem.
Today is the last day of the festival.
So, we can get them married tomorrow.
That's not necessary. Police are looking
for us 'cause she's the SP's daughter.
We just need to stay here for two days.
As you wish.
Brother.
What's all that commotion about?
That's just… our lifelong crisis.
An argument over water distribution.
Police might come here.
Police? What can they do?
If we go to the police or the court…
they would ask for the documents,
witnesses, and evidence.
All we need is some water.
We'll figure it out somehow.
Hello?
Hello!
{\an8}Youth wings and associations
of the opposition party
{\an8}are leading large-scale
protests all over Kerala.
{\an8}Twelve hours have passed
since Jayan left us.
{\an8}The state has never witnessed the kinds
of incidents that are happening now.
{\an8}The accused police officers have managed
to escape from the police station.
{\an8}The Kerala Police haven't
succeeded in finding
{\an8}the culprits even after several hours.
{\an8}Questioning the police is
not going to work here.
{\an8}Because the accused are
also the police officers.
{\an8}It was the police who helped
the culprits to escape as well.
{\an8}I have only one thing to say.
As long as this government is ruling,
{\an8}I have no hope that the backward
classes or the Dalit people of Kerala
{\an8}would ever get any kind of justice.
{\an8}This incident is very inhuman!
{\an8}Our society will definitely respond
to this through the ballot papers.
{\an8}Mr. George…
{\an8}the upcoming by-election
is extremely crucial.
{\an8}Are you sure your party will be
able to win this by-election?
{\an8}Aparna, you need to understand one thing.
{\an8}The government which is ruling
now is committed to its people.
{\an8}Just because some criminal
police officers did some atrocity,
{\an8}they are trying to play caste
politics to gain political mileage!
{\an8}That won't work here!
{\an8}This is Kerala!
{\an8}Remember this!
{\an8}Our government registered
this murder case…
{\an8}and transferred it to the crime branch
within 24 hours of the incident.
{\an8}So, I am 100% sure that we will win
this by-election, and along with that,
{\an8}all the culprits in this case will be
taken into custody before the election!
{\an8}Mark my words!
{\an8}Mr. George, one night has passed
since this incident happened.
{\an8}And you are still repeating whatever
the Chief Minister said last night!
Within these 12 hours,
what action has the police
taken on this issue?
Excuse me, sir.
Hello.
-Sir!
-Yes?
Sir, we've arrested the driver
who helped the culprits escape
and the Tamilian who gave them his phone.
-Good. I am with the CM.
-And--
Let me put you on speakerphone.
Sir, we have an update.
With your permission.
Sir, we've arrested the driver
who helped the culprits escape
and the Tamilian who gave them his phone.
We've got visuals of them traveling on
a tractor around the Top Station area.
They've gone to Vattavada, sir.
About 10-15 years back,
ASI Maniyan had gone there on duty.
So, he has contacts there.
We are heading to Vattavada now, sir.
I must know whatever action
you are going to take.
Sir.
Hold a press conference…
and declare that we've arrested
those, who helped the culprits escape.
Yes, sir.
Raid the culprits' relatives'
and friends' houses and arrest them
in the presence of the media.
-They shouldn't question us hereafter.
-Yes, sir!
Ask the makeup man to come on stage.
Okay.
We're here at the club, sir.
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
We'll do that, sir.
Sit there.
No, sir. There aren't any
other law and order problems.
Hello!
I am near the Mariyamman Temple.
Where are you?
Okay! I can see you!
Ma'am, I am Jayaprasad.
Any information?
We've got the information that
three new people have been
spotted in Kottakamboor.
-Kottakamboor?
-Yes, ma'am.
This is our border, ma'am.
There is a forest beyond this point.
There were many cannabis
farms over there earlier.
About 500 Tamil families stay here.
All are farmers.
Does that route lead to any other place?
If we go by car,
it'll take us back to Munnar.
The other one is the forest route that
leads either to Kodaikanal or Palani.
Only those who are familiar
with that route can go that way.
-Okay. When will we get there?
-It will definitely be past 5:00 p.m.
But it wouldn't be possible
tonight because of the fog.
We have a couple of informers.
We haven't been able to communicate with
them because of the network issue.
Okay.
It's hot.
Arrange the dog squad…
and get the clothes of the accused so
that the dogs could trace their location.
Mr. Praveen!
Mr. Maniyan and I have had
several escapades here.
Fifteen years ago…
there had been a cannabis
raid in this forest.
I was also with them.
You can't imagine what all we had done!
It's funny to think about it even now.
Sir.
Have some coffee.
Here you go, sir.
Brother.
Can we reach Tamil Nadu if
we take the forest route?
If you take the forest route,
you'll reach Palani after two days.
But the problem is that there would be
wild elephants and tigers on the way.
You'll have to be careful.
Dear… what happened?
Are you not feeling well?
I have a headache.
Apply this to your forehead.
You'll feel better in no time.
Sir, stop drinking alcohol.
Have some coffee instead.
Today is the last day of the festival.
I'll be back.
Brother… your mundu is torn.
A dog must have torn it.
It doesn't look like a dog's doing.
That's the police in you talking!
What else can we expect from you!
Keep this.
-Mr. Mani, I'll be back soon.
-Okay.
We need details of all
the homestays here.
Check whether Maniyan has
contacted anyone here.
-Okay?
-Ma'am!
There are about three homestays here.
Only North Indians and
foreigners are staying there.
There are a couple more
in the interior areas.
We'll contact them as soon as possible.
How many days does this
festival go on for?
Today is the last day, ma'am.
-Hello?
-Sir, we have arrived in Kottakamboor.
We are collecting information
about them from the locals.
Now we are going to check
the homestays, sir.
The primary information is
that there are no Malayalis there.
One pack of cigarettes, please.
And one pack of sanitary pads.
-How much?
-That'd be Rs. 130.
Sir… wear a jacket.
It's really cold.
Here.
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.
Okay?
Groundnuts taste the same no
matter where they are from.
I'm not lying.
They're nice.
Sir!
Come, let's eat something.
Do you hear that song?
It's nice, right?
My father wanted me to be a singer.
My daughter was born when
I was in this forest back then.
For the cannabis hunt.
I saw my daughter's face
15 days after she was born.
I had promised her…
that I'd go with her to her competition.
It's tomorrow.
And even now, I am here.
I'm starving.
Porridge?
Sir.
Didn't you add salt to this, Sunitha?
I did, sir.
It doesn't have salt.
It doesn't have salt at all.
Why are you complaining, sir?
It's not like we're really hungry!
If we suddenly have to escape from here,
we might not get to eat anything!
We're also worried!
What are you worried about?
Ever since my daughter was born, I haven't
been able to go with her anywhere…
as her father, even once.
I have a headache!
I don't even have my medicine.
It's them.
Hey!
Move, dear!
Apart from Kottakamboor,
what other villages are nearby?
If we go through the forest,
then there are small villages like
Kilavarai, Kadavari, etc.
As they're under the forest department's
observation, they can't stay there.
If they go northwest from here,
then they can go to Kanthalloor
via Pazhathottam-Chenduvarai.
From there,
they might go to Tamil Nadu by car.
They are here.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have
taken this route from Munnar.
Someone is helping them here.
The farmers are bursting crackers
to chase the pigs away, ma'am.
Shobi, come here!
Hey, Moorthy!
Is it our man at the court?
-Why? What happened?
-He's lying there drunk.
Shobi, come on!
Maari, put this in
the temple donation box.
They are going to Palani.
Shobi!
Shobi, come on!
Mr. Mani!
You started drinking early today!
Sir, this used to be a court long back.
It's a perfect place to booze.
Sir!
Can you please stop boozing?
We're trying our best to escape
from this problem.
And you're boozing all the time!
Going to jail is better than this!
If you keep doing this,
we won't be able to escape from here!
DALIT YOUNGSTER'S DEATH: STUDENT'S
YOUTH FESTIVAL DREAM SHATTERED
Brother…
can we go to Palani with the people
who went this way earlier?
You can't go now, sir.
They would have entered
the forest by now.
You won't be able to take Mr. Maniyan
along in his present condition.
Another group is going there tomorrow.
If you want to go with them, you'll
need to pack some food for the journey.
-He had come here yesterday.
-At what time?
-Just before I closed the shop.
-What did he buy?
Cigarettes and sanitary pads.
What's the update?
Sir, they're here. They'd been
to one of the shops last night.
Don't you have the dog squad with you?
Sir, the street is covered with
turmeric because of the festival.
Dogs are unable to trace them.
Then, find them with the
help of the military!
This is not the time for a one-man show!
Sir, it's not practical.
You don't know the
geography of this place.
This village is surrounded by a forest.
Many people here are into
the cannabis business.
If we send the force,
the culprits will find out immediately.
They might escape into the forest.
-It's risky, sir.
-What risk?
Do you have any bloody idea
of the situation I'm in?
And the pressure from
the CM to solve the case?
You haven't found the culprits even
after two days! Now call off your search!
I'm sending the force.
Where is today's newspaper?
Moorthy took it with him.
Who is Moorthy?
He does farming on the other
side of that hill, ma'am.
Didn't you say that there
are no Malayalis here?
Yeah. There are no Malayalis here.
Whose phone has a signal?
Ma'am.
Sir, Anuradha here!
Sir, please give me two more hours!
Please, sir!
Sir, we're almost there!
Please, sir!
Thank you, sir.
Sir, the situation is quite critical.
All the survey reports are against us.
Sir, this incident has strongly
influenced the neutral votes.
As per the intelligence
report I received,
Dalit associations have called for a press
conference at seven o'clock tonight.
If we don't arrest the culprits by then,
they'd boycott tomorrow's election.
Sir, they have about 50,000 votes.
We've been getting about
90% of those votes for ages.
So, it's crucial.
Sir, Anuradha had called now.
They've got information
on the culprits now.
We're very close to nabbing them, sir.
I need a solution before seven o'clock.
Come here only when you have that.
Ma'am, it's the DGP.
Hello!
We've located the culprits, sir.
Arrest them!
They are not in a position
where we can arrest them.
What is stopping you?
They are at a place from where they can
easily spot us, no matter where we go.
The forest is right behind them.
They have a dog with them.
Moreover, one of those three
people is not with them now.
We have to wait, sir.
We cannot wait in such
a crucial situation!
I need action immediately!
Sir, their local supporter is with us.
We've arrested him.
They plan to leave for
Palani tomorrow morning.
No… I don't want to hear any excuse!
Enough!
Sir, we can try going in disguise.
But if something happens,
you have to take the risk.
Hello!
Hello!
Sir, we've located the culprits.
-They are under our surveillance.
-Then, why don't you arrest them?
Sir, we need some additional force there.
That's what they are waiting for.
Sir, it's risky to delay it until then.
It'll be late by the time they're
arrested and brought here.
There won't even be a news
article in tomorrow's papers.
That will affect
the polling in the morning.
Sir, they will decide to boycott
the election at 7:00 p.m.
We must find a solution before that.
Sir, we can try going in disguise.
But they are police
officers, so that's risky.
They also have a dog with them.
If they feel the presence of the police,
they will enter the forest.
Once they enter the forest,
we won't be able to trace
them or meet our deadline.
What if they escape before the evening?
Sir, the man who helped
them is in our custody.
They plan to leave for
Palani tomorrow morning.
Are you 100% sure you'll be
able to arrest them today?
Yes, sir.
{\an8}The three police officers who are
the culprits in the Jayan Murder Case
{\an8}have been arrested. They've been
brought to the Aluva Police Club.
{\an8}You can see those visuals now.
{\an8}The three of them will be
thoroughly interrogated here.
{\an8}Following which, they might be
presented in court tomorrow.
This Jayan Murder Case
was a strong weapon that the opposition
had found against the ruling government
just before the election.
As the election is scheduled
to happen tomorrow,
{\an8}this arrest will be a huge
relief for the government.
{\an8}No doubt about that!
The third one is here.
Forget it, man.
I will be okay.
I never expected that
they'll go to my house…
and do this atrocity.
I've been running around as their
hunting dog for about 20 years!
I never committed any
atrocity for my own sake.
Anyway, I will be okay.
You should also forget about it.
We should find some other
job when we go back home.
This is not meant for people like us.
Where are you going now, sir?
To crap.
Move!
Will we be acquitted
if we go to court, sir?
Mr. Maniyan will figure something out.
I will quit this job once I get back.
Sir!
Sir!
Mr. Maniyan!
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Hello.
Hello!
Sir…
we've got the culprits.
But one of them hung himself, sir.
What?
Two of them moved unexpectedly.
By the time…
we chased them and got here,
the third one was hanging
dead at an old building.
The remaining two are
in our custody, sir.
Sir?
Hello?
Hello!
Hello!
Sir…
one of the culprits hung
himself to death in Munnar.
I will tell the media that the police
gave me distorted information.
Then, you'll have to answer them.
Call Rajan.
Hello! Who all are there with you?
Only my team, sir.
Listen!
Because you'd promised that you'd arrest
them today, we made a dummy arrest here.
The CM had asked me to do it,
but he's washed his hands of it now.
Look!
Both the culprits and the corpse should
reach the police club at the earliest.
If the case gets complicated,
it'll be transferred to another agency!
You'll be held responsible for the death!
What the fuck!
Shut up, you stupid!
I won't take the responsibility!
I know what to do!
Fuck you!
Pull it down slowly.
Hold the leg carefully.
I'll hold it from behind.
-Hey!
-Find something to cover it.
What the hell is happening?
Who asked you to untie the body
before the inquest procedures?
Ma'am, what was our fault?
-We weren't even--
-Hey!
If you blabber over here,
I'll kill both of you!
Take the body!
Ma'am, please come.
The order is to take the body to the
club, come what may. I will do it.
Will it be the end of this?
No.
What can you do, ma'am?
You might say all this
to the media or the court.
Earlier, an IPS officer spoke against
the state on humanitarian grounds.
He has been in jail for two years now.
He didn't even get out on bail.
I've been in service
longer than you, ma'am.
Our fate is not far from that dead man's.
Take the body.
Catch him!
This is my dying declaration.
That car was mine…
but I wasn't driving it that day.
My sister's son was driving it.
Those innocents were
just traveling with me.
My daughter shouldn't live
as a murderer's daughter.
The court should consider
this as my dying declaration
and investigate this case truthfully.
Those innocents should be acquitted.
I'm ending this.
-Is there another copy of this?
-No, sir.
Sir…
it was Rahul who drove the car
when the accident happened.
We realized it was Jayan only
when we carried him to the car.
Just before the accident happened,
Rahul had withdrawn money from an ATM.
If you check its security
camera, you'd spot Rahul in it.
Or if you locate his
and our mobile towers,
you'd find out that
we were together, sir.
Praveen…
from what you're saying, we can prove
that there was someone else in the car.
But the fingerprints on the car's
steering wheel are yours.
This argument won't stand in court.
Sir…
our department will be able
to prove the truth, right?
Praveen…
you know that the department cannot do
anything against the government, right?
Especially in this situation,
because the media has created such
a negative image of your case.
As the election is happening today,
we cannot expect anything
else from the government.
Just like you, the DGP and the entire
police system are locked in this case.
We must solve this at any cost.
Give it to me.
This is your statement which says that…
Maniyan committed suicide after he got
here. Both of you will have to sign it.
We can prepare Maniyan's suicide note
with the help of a handwriting expert.
Maniyan will be declared guilty.
All of us will be safe.
We don't have any other option now.
I won't do it, sir.
Even if I'm hung to death for
this, I won't do it.
Just before he died…
he was talking about his daughter.
He lived his whole life for his daughter.
That girl shouldn't have to live
as a murderer's daughter.
I can't do this.
This has Maniyan's declaration
video, right?
The outside world is
never going to see this.
And you said you can prove scientifically
that Rahul was driving, right?
Give that to me.
My name is Rahul.
Sir, I was driving the car that day.
All of them had consumed alcohol.
When Mr. Praveen saw Jayan,
he started the steering car.
When the accident took place,
I got scared and ran away.
If this goes to court,
you'll get nothing short
of life imprisonment.
Both of you are young.
Give it another thought.
We have time until we have to go to court.
-Sir, the forensic team is here.
-Okay. Call them.
This is a huge relief for
the state government…
as they were able to catch all three
culprits of the Jayan Murder Case.
They were brought last night to the
Aluva Police Club, which you can see here.
One of those police officers committed
suicide earlier this morning.
The inquest procedures of the dead
policeman are happening right now.
The remaining two police officers
will be taken to court shortly.
The police have arranged tight
security here prior to that.
Because chances are that
large-scale protests might happen.
Anyway, the crowd has
gathered here already.
Like I mentioned earlier, this is
a huge relief for the state government
because a very crucial
election is happening today.
So, capturing these three culprits is
quite beneficial for the government.
That's what we can say right now.
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!
-Go to hell, police!
-Go to hell, police!
-We will teach you a lesson!
-We will teach you a lesson!
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!
-Long live the revolution!
