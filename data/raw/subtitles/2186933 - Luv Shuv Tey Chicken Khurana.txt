Hi!
Omi Khurana... -Chang...
Chang.
Business or pleasure?
-Business...
Business. -Yeah!
Nice girls... right?
Yeah!
You... you want to meet girls?
No problem! -Come on...
Okay! -Yeah come on!
Come on buddy.
That's enough, guys.
Have some drinks, on the house!
Beat it, Jackson.
Tell me...
Trust me, Shanty...
l'll pay back every penny...
-Not penny, its pounds!
Pounds with the Queen's portrait.
Fifty grand!
Give me a few days...
A few days? Why?
Struck another deal?
Deal?
l'll show you a bloody deal!
Real estate... Stock market...
you've blown up my money!
How do you intend
to give it back?
l could kill you and
sell your kidneys...
Brother... -Answer, Omi...
l can't stop my finger
any longer...
My home...
l'll get my family
to send the money!
You have a tree that sprouts
Pounds back in Punjab?
Oh no, Shanty bro...
my grandpa runs a renowned
eatery in Punjab...
so it's Pounds all the way!
Get them to transfer it tomorrow.
lt's quite a bit...
wouldn't it be better to transfer
in smaller lots?
Manty! -Yes, brother?
Meet my cousin Manty from
Jatanna new to UK.
How's it going, man?
All good, brother.
Get him a return ticket to
Punjab and pack him off!
Sure.
He'll bring my Pounds.
Oh no, Shanty bro l don't
need to go there!
Unless you have my Pounds,
l won't let you come back.
Don't do that...
l've slogged hard for 10 years
to finally settle down...
lt's my dream, bro!
lt's a fair deal, Omi.
l have your dream...
you have my Pounds...
Return my Pounds and
live your dream!
Let's go, Manty.
Get him on the plane.
Let's go! -Shanty bro...
l said let's go!
Shanty bro...
-Let's get his ticket to Punjab.
Come on! We're getting late.
-Will you stop pulling me!
Keep your voice down.
Coming back from the UK?
How can you tell?
lt's written all over your face!
Every day it's a new guy
at the airport...
One whiff and l can
name the country!
l'm kidding!
l saw the tag on your luggage.
After how many years
are you back?
About 10-12 years...
Whoa!
That's a very long time! -Yes.
Your parents live with
you in London?
No,
they passed away 20 years ago.
My grandpa lives in Lalton.
Why don't you just
look at the road!
Stop!
The red house on the left.
See you.
Yes?
Anyone home?
No, sir. They're all out.
How may l help you?
Well, you could--
Are you a relative?
Yes...
Make yourself comfortable.
Let me take your things...
-No, it's alright.
Grandpa around?
No.
lt's been about 10 days his
condition got worse...
Shit man!
That's not what l meant.
He was admitted to the hospital.
Everyone's gone to bring him
back since he's fine now.
Grandpa will outlive all of us!
Have a seat, l'll get some water.
Listen...
What's your name?
Dalidri.
Dalidri!
Sounds like a warrior's name.
l'll get you some fresh lime.
That would be great!
Why don't you understand?
All my friends are
going overseas...
why can't l?
Grandpa, all l'm asking for
is 600 thousand rupees!
Give me one year.
And if l don't quadruple
that in one year...
l'm not worthy to
be your grandson.
Our neighbour's son went to
Canada six months ago.
He's got a job at
a petrol pump...
110 dollars a month!
lt makes no difference if he
is in Canada or America!
Listen, Omi...
we are satisfied with
what we have.
We don't want you to
go away from us.
l think you should help grandpa
at the eatery...
l don't want to eat dirt all day!
Why don't you tell your
son the same thing?
What are you trying to say?
Are you not my son?
Never mind...
lf he wants to go overseas,
let him.
Destiny will take care
of the rest...
You better not get into this.
Don't pamper him so much
that he ruins his life.
l'm afraid he'll fall into bad
company and throw away his life.
So, it's decided!
Omi,
you are not going away from us.
To hell with your decision!
You are not my dad!
That's enough...
that's enough!
That's not how you talk
to your uncle.
Dalidri...
Who are you?
He's a relative, Titu uncle.
Relative?! -Yeah!
What do you mean relative!?!
You let anyone walk in...
...is this your pop's house?
-No...
...not your pop's either!
You will pay for this...
l'll peel your skin!
Dalidri... -Do you need help?
No, go on we'll be there...
Jeet, be careful...
Yes, mom.
A few days away from home and it
doesn't look like home anymore.
Grandpa... slowly...
The chilli is where l left it...
...the clothes are still on the
line wonder what he does!
Slowly grandpa...
Come dear.
A few more steps, grandpa...
-Take this inside...
Yes.. -Here, grandpa...
The medicines too...
-Here, grandpa...
back home at last.
You'll get well soon come.
Careful, dear.
Take it, it's a small bundle.
Slowly...
Slowly... keep it here.
Titu!
You're never there when needed.
Give Jeet a hand.
Come here.
At your service!
Coming.
Grandpa, you look handsome.
A good home cooked meal and
grandpa will be fit in no time.
He looks better now...
Yes?
Grandpa... sorry.
l'll make you proud one day.
Here, drink some water.
You've got a visitor,
brother-in-law.
l do have a name, you know?
Brother... Omi!
My brother!
How have you been? -You're back?!
Omi is back...
My brother is back!
Where did you go?
You had us worried.
Give me a hug, my dear...
-l told you, Omi will come back!
l can't believe it!
You're all grown up.
You ran away and look what
happened to grandpa.
He's lost his memory.
Omi, perhaps he might recognise
you... -Come...
Grandpa...
lt's me, Omi.
Omi. -How do you like your
chicken? Grilled or fried?
No more butter, please!
l'm stuffed!
Dear! -Here you go brother.
That's enough...
Omi, pinch me.
What?
- Pinch me. -Go on, do it...
This isn't a dream.
You haven't changed, aunt Lata!
We may not be your parents but...
we love you just the
same as Jeet!
My two princes!
Right?
My dear sister,
l'm no evil uncle either...
just pass some butter so that
your food becomes edible!
What nonsense, Titu!
You've grown like a bull and
you're asking for butter!
l get no respect at all!
Come on, uncle... have my butter!
Why can't she just give me some?!
Mom, just give him some!
Here... stuff yourself!
ls this fresh?
He has to complain...
that ticks me off!
Right!
As if you're a gourmet chef!
Here you go... tea...
Dalidri... did you heat the milk?
Yes, it's been a while.
l forgot. -Listen...
Dalidri, right? -Yes, brother.
You've got a kickass name!
-lsn't it?
Yeah man!
Dalidri's like a son.
-Let me get cookies, brother.
Hey you...
Yes?
-You didn't offer me any tea...
Well, you don't have tea.
Have you forgotten your manners?
Come on, uncle...
Don't patronize me.
What would this young lad
from England think?
This is how servants
behave in lndia...?
Auntyji, are you on the terrace?
Come here...
-l'm searching for you downstairs.
Mom has sent these
sweets for you.
Greetings. -Bless you, my dear.
That no-good tailor you suggested
ruined all my clothes.
Never mind your clothes.
Keep the sweets.
Take a look guess who is here...
Don't recognise?
What about you, Omi?
That's strange!
Look at her this is Harman.
Harman and you would go to school
in the rickshaw... remember?
She's a doctor now.
Oh... right... Hi!
Why do you look so coy?
No... not at all.
Hello...
Omi,
we've got a surprise for you...
Harman and Jeet are
getting married.
That's brilliant, Jeet!
You didn't tell me about it...
Well... it skipped my mind...
lt's been a year...
since you planned their wedding.
And your darling has
been putting it off.
What nonsense, Titu!
Jeet was busy with work.
l'll make sure they get
married next month.
Let's see...
but l really doubt it.
His nonsense never ends.
Auntyji, it's getting late...
please get me grandpa's
medicine box.
Why are you in a hurry?
-Just get it, please.
Okay...
Grandpa...
how are you feeling?
Are you feeling good
after returning home? -Jeet...
lf l were part of Harman's
family...
l would've checked your family
jewels before the marriage.
Why can't you look around
before you talk?
Just talk whatever you want.
Here it is.
Didn't the naturopath give
grandpa's digestive mix?
Of course he did.
lt should be there.
Here it is. Hold this, please...
Grandpa, open your mouth.
He's recovered quite a bit.
-Yes, he has.
Here are the medicines,
let me show you.
Give this before his bed time.
l'll take your leave now.
Alright, eat something.. -No!
What's wrong with you?
Why are you running? -l've work..
You can eat it.
-What's wrong with her today?
That's enough!
Omi has come back after 10 years.
Are you telling me,
l can't even feed him?
l can't believe it!
You have a way of twisting
my words!
He didn't do us a favour...
he stole from his family...
Trust me, people never change...
some day he will get
us into trouble.
Please, that's enough!
Don't poison my mind.
He didn't even say 'hello'...
but that makes no difference
to you.
Not at all...
and you welcomed him with
open arms, right?
Tell me?!
Keep an eye on the jewellery
and money...
Not another word!
All l said is keep an eye...
Listen to me.
l have your dream...
you have my Pounds...
Return my Pounds and
live your dream!
Bloody crow!
No, no...
don't you swear, he-man!
That's your grandma!
Grandma?
Very funny, uncle!
Your grandpa says that
she is his wife.
Don't shoo her away...
That's what your grandpa says.
He believes the crow is your
grandma's reincarnation.
Oh please! Stop!
Scoot!
He-man! -Yeah?
How about a duel...
They've all gone nuts!
Hey! -Bloody crazy!
Dalidri... come here!
Yes?
My underwear is wet...
and l want it dried soon...
l'll see what l can do.
Thanks.
This is all you have?
l forgot to pack more.
My Omi won't wear the
same underwear.
What size do you wear?
l'll manage... don't bother...
How can l not bother!
There's plenty of underwear...
Jeet! -Why are you calling Jeet?
The label is worn out...
What's wrong?
What's your underwear size?
l don't remember.
Well,
it changes with the season...
What's going on?
Looks like parliament
is in session.
He forgot to get underwear.
Wear mine... problem solved!
What nonsense, Titu!
As if you've ever worn any...
...or ever will! -What's the matter?
At least l have a big heart!
How about uncle's underwear?
Shut up! -You shut up, Titu!
You could cover a truck
with his underwear!
But he doesn't wear
these 'V' shaped...
He can go commando today.
Have you lost your mind?
l'll give him mine.
Omi just wear mine.
Jeet, hurry up!
Jeet, come back.
Look at that... it's dry.
l know it's dry...
but l'll get new ones
for you today.
Wait, why are you in a hurry?
Titu! Help him buy underwear.
Come on.
Hey hotties!
-Get lost, you sleazebag!
They'll thrash us!
Relax, we go back a long way!
Lovely,
where are the latest designs?
Dad, they are all around you.
Take a look.
Position them right,
position is everything.
Uncle, is there no other store?
Why? You get the best here.
Let's go.
Titu... welcome...
Show him some fancy undies.
Go on...
Omi Khurana!
How're you doing, Lovely?
Very well... it's been ages, man!
Haven't seen you since school...
Where have you been?
ln London, these days.
London!
l'd like to see those...
Hunk.
-Titu, something for you perhaps?
When did you arrive?
Dad, mom has sent tea.
Give it, dear.
Be careful, the flask is hot.
Harman, you didn't tell
us that Omi is back.
l guess l forgot...
-How can you forget?
Everything we have is because
of your grandpa.
Give me a 420.
We are grateful to him.
lt's our good fortune that she
is marrying your brother.
Dad, l've to rush to the
hospital. See you.
As if the patients will
die without her!
Shut up! -Watch out, Lovely!
Have some tea.
Sorry! All l have is pounds...
No big deal,
we'll figure it later.
l don't advise people to
go to the temple...
ln fact, l myself don't go...
because,
my temple exists in my mind.
With a temple in your mind, you'll
*hear the bells ringing in your heart.
Turn down the volume.
Let it be.
Omi!
She is your uncle's aunt!
Your grandpa's cousin.
She ran away in her youth,
now look at her...
Wow!
See the plight of the saints!
Auntyji, grandpa's blood
pressure is normal.
Thank god! Omi...
Yes, aunty. -l think it's time to
change your bandage.
lt's fine... l'll manage.
Relax... the doctor is
practically family...
Harman,
please change his bandage.
lf you insist.
How do you do?
What's wrong?
Lost your tongue since l left?
Auntyji, he's been cured.
Omi, l missed you a lot.
Bro...
Sorry, Jeet.
l broke your eye.
l was aiming at that
scoundrel Haddi...
and you got in the way.
Forget it, Omi.
lt's an old issue now.
Easy for you to say.
l know you always cared for me.
l know it.
Let me take a look...
Can you...
get tears in this eye?
Never mind me...
let's talk about England...
Everything good for you?
Of course it's good.
So, what do you do?
Well... you see...
l'm a lawyer.
Lawyer?!
What the--
Lawyer?!
Well...
do you have a house there?
House?!
l've had a mansion for ages.
And... how far is it...
from the Queen's house?
Queen?
Queen of Elizabeth...
Monarch of London...
You mean, Buckingham?
-From Buckingham!
Say this is the queen's house...
l got the queen.
and here is a big park.
Of course, the big park!
Two blocks after the park...
One... two...
Yes, this..
Not that lane, man.
That lane is where...
the steel magnate, Mittal lives.
We'll get to him later.
Hold on.
You see the mansion
in the corner?
This?
With a Ferrari parked
in the front...
The red Ferrari?
That's my mansion!
That's as close as our house
is from the animal clinic!
Bingo!
That's wonderful, Omi!
You've become a lawyer...
you have a mansion...
and have a Ferrari
which is red...
you must be a millionaire!
Well, l don't keep track anymore!
l pretty much control
the stock exchange.
lf you ever want to invest,
just let me know...
and soon you too will have
a mansion in London.
Times are tough these days...
but let me have a
word with dad...
No, don't do that...
why do you always have to
get uncle involved?!
You're just a--
So, what's going on in your life?
You're getting married...
l'll get drunk and do the
bhangra at your wedding!
Omi...
Tell me something...
lf someone...
Falls into the river...
What are you doing?
What if someone falls...
-Time to head home, Jeet.
What if someone falls
into the river?
Stop doing that!
Will they remain in lndia
or flow away to Pakistan?
Jeet.
Hey! What are you doing?!
A damp wind is blowing...
Silence, Jeet.
Or you'll wake everyone up.
Go to sleep... please!
lt's a fair deal, Omi.
l have your dream...
you have my Pounds...
Return my Pounds and
live your dream!
Grandpa...
l don't like to complain but...
Omi has left me with no choice.
What did you do?
Nothing at all, grandpa.
She's just making up things.
l don't believe this...
he's accusing me!
ln the presence of the whole
class, he asked my daughter...
'Will you kiss me?' -Don't lie!
Silence!
She is right.
Why did you ask when other
students were around?
You should've asked when
you and her were alone.
Grandpa,
that's not what l'm saying.
Why did he have to ask?
Of course! l agree...
Why did you ask...
you should've just kissed her.
Grandpa,
that's not what l'm saying.
l mean,
it's wrong to ask for a kiss.
Omi, you better remember that!
Never ask for one...
just go for it.
Am l right?
Never mind... it doesn't matter.
Let's go home...
and stop grinning!
C'mon.. -What happened?
You rascal!
Very smart, are you?
Grandpa, it hurts...
Please, grandpa...
let it go... please!
There... how's that?
Stop farting, grandpa...
it's embarrassing!
When you fart among your dear
ones, you spread love!
My ear hurts!
l hope that lady won't
complain again.
Perhaps not...
but some other lady might!
You scoundrel!
Let me get home,
l'll give you a hiding...
Oh god... my legs!
How l've yearned for you,
Our love was so true,
We'll be together until
the end of time,
We'll be together until
the end of time,
My soul cries out for you,
as for you l pine.
Move your hands fast...
we've come for breakfast,
don't make us wait untill dinner!
What nonsense, Titu!
Mom... did l tell you?
Omi is now a renowned
lawyer in London.
He has a mansion and
a red Ferrari.
l knew Omi would make it big...
l always believed in
his brilliance.
lt's all because of
your faith in me.
Did you hear that grandpa...
Omi is a lawyer.
Chicken tandoori or with butter?
Shift...
Do you always have to barge in?
Listen...
do you handle rape cases?
Of course!
Omi, what about marriage?
Not right now...
l'm working on some important
cases and there's a lot to do...
Are you seeing someone?
Let's focus on Jeet for now!
Mom, l'm off to work.
l'll be late tonight,
l'm going to the shrine.
Okay.
No god can help him...
He is useless... get it?
Poor girl... so unfair...
What are you trying to say?
There's something wrong
with his piston!
You understand piston?
l understand that and a lot more!
Uncle,
what are you trying to say?
See how delicious she is...
how can a real man resist her?
You look like a hunter.
l'm sure you've hunted some
white tigresses in London!
This scoundrel is still
in business?
Of course!
He would send his son to spy
on grandpa, remember?
That scoundrel Haddi!
The local crowd doesn't
go there...
but he controls the
highway business.
All the truckers eat here.
Oh come on...
he is nothing compared
to our eatery.
What's wrong?
No one told you?
Told me what?
Cut the suspense!
Our eatery is no more.
What?
You know grandpa alone knew how
to prepare Chicken Khurana...
You mean, grandpa didn't share
the recipe with anyone?!
No...
Grandpa's health wasn't
the same...
Dad tried to manage
the place but...
it wasn't the same without
Chicken Khurana.
We were forced to shut down...
Grandpa would often say...
'Omi will manage Chicken
Khurana'.
But you became a lawyer instead.
See how it's falling apart...
So, what do you think?
lt's mind blowing!
l'm proud of you, Jeet.
All thanks to grandpa.
This is nothing...
you've really made it.
And all on your own.
Omi...
to be honest,
l always looked up to you.
You were cool, confident, hip...
Leave it!
Khushi...
Khushi... come here...
come here... -Very cute.
Good morning, Jeet.
-Good morning.
This is my brother, Omi.
Hello... Omi, from London.
Shama... Shama Singh Chatterjee,
pleased to meet you.
Khushi, stand properly. -Sweet kid...
Dad! -Khushi!
That's uncle Omi... not dad.
l am sorry. -lt's alright.
l'll see you...
Do l look like her father?
Shama's husband was
in the army...
he passed away a few years ago.
Oh! That's tragic.
The goddess who rides the lions
*fearlessly, l bow in front of thee!
Please stay quite, goddess!
That was great... superb!
Brother...
Everything okay?
Of course... everything's good.
You look worried?
Me?
Last night you were acting
funny after getting drunk.
Trust me, l'm fine.
'You're fine.'
l don't think so.
lf something's bothering you...
Bloody hell... my finger!
Harman... -Yes?
Will his finger be alright? -Yes.
lt's nothing... just a scratch.
Thank the goddess!
Hello...
yes, sir, hello...
Hold on... please...
Omi, l'll be right back.
Yes. Hello!
probably the network...
Let it go now. Sorry.
Burn in hell!
Omi... -Yes?
Let me drop you home.
Something important has come up.
Relax, l'll take a rickshaw.
A rickshaw will take hours.
Harman... -Yes?
Aren't you going home
to see grandpa? -Yes.
Perfect...
you can take Omi along.
Jeet, l'll come to your showroom.
Hello... -Jeet...
Yes, sir, l'm on the way...
l'll be there soon.
Shall we?
l really miss the fields
in London...
So, a doctor now, eh?
You've lost weight too.
Say something, my lady.
Get off!
Get off!
l was just trying to break
the tension, Harman.
Enough with the Queen's English!
You think you're great?
Who the hell do you
think you are...
you think your sad jokes
will set things right?
But, nothing will ever
be the same again!
l said l am sorry...
Sorry?
That's all you've got?
Sorry is all you had
ten years ago, too.
Here's your bloody letter...
Sorry, honey...
l'm gonna make money...'
This is what you wrote!
Relax...
there's no need to over-react.
l'm not over-reacting... got it?
Hold on...
l didn't ask you out...
you came with a box of 'Fruit
and Nuts' for me. -So?
l mean, l didn't want
to break your heart.
We were good friends but then
you got all emotional...
Listen... l didn't get emotional.
You would hang outside
my place...
like a loser.
'Harman, you complete me.'
You said that.
Probably one of your
other admirers.
You're right, l was a fool.
But didn't you ever feel
like calling me?
At least tell me you are alive?
Omi...
l deserved that, at least.
lt makes no difference to you.
Let's talk on the way.
Get off my scooter!
Okay.
Shameless!
Harman...
Harman, how do l get home now?
Hi folks,
on this enchanting evening...
l bring you this age old classic,
from a time gone by...
gladden your hearts...
''They elude..''
''Moving past breezily..''
''Eagerness keeps rising..''
''..hear it, or know it for yourself.''
''Eagerness keeps rising..''
''..hear it, or know it for yourself.''
''The heartbeat..''
''The heartbeat..''
''..pace swiftly.''
''Eagerness keeps rising..''
''..hear it, or know it for yourself.''
''..hear it, or know it for yourself.''
Old fellow,
you think this is edible?
daughter-in-law calls food.
lsn't there something
you remember...
Think my lovely..
chicken, tomatoes, onions and...?
Tell me you wizard, what was your
*secret ingredient in Chicken Khurana?
Aren't you fed up of eating this?
Of course, you are helpless...
but have you no pity on me?
Don't you wish you could
tell me the secret?
You know how l loved
Chicken Khurana...
but you are happy
to see me suffer.
Enough nonsense, Titu!
Be grateful that l cook.
Dad had a piles attack
last year...
Oh the bleeding!
The doctor couldn't
figure it out.
l gave an offering at the shrine
and the bleeding stopped.
Jeet... l'm eating here.
Of course, carry on.
Hello?
You have a call, Omi brother.
For me? -Yes.
Hello? -Enjoying the vacation?
Hello?
Cat got your tongue?
Hello...
Hello...
l can't hear you...
And now your ears have given up!
Hello... -He is just fooling
around with us!
Hello?
Omi, now you are screwed!
Have you forgotten the beating?
Don't test my patience...
You'll wish you were dead!
He hung up on you!
Now he's gone too far...
trust me.
Who was it?
A wrong number...
This happens quite often, dad...
l am done!
You hardly ate! -l'm stuffed.
What? -Acidity, l guess.
Omi...
Uncle, l'm busy right now.
You've got nothing to fear!
l act like a lunatic so
that l can stay here.
l mean, look at me...
Do l look like a lunatic?
We're two peas in a pod.
l hate to work.
And l thought this is the
smartest way to an easy life!
Can l sleep now?
Sorry...
l thought finally,
l have a confidant...
a buddy,
l could share my feelings with
Oh well...
good night. -Uncle... please!
You're up?
You know...
l had a friend once.
We'd go to the mental asylum and
act crazy for shock treatment.
He was crazy about white women...
Colour didn't matter to me.
One day,
we decided to travel the world...
...and meet as many as we could.
But he betrayed me.
You know... the number of
mental attacks l faked...
hoping to meet him at
some mental asylum.
But l never saw him again.
My dream broke into
a million pieces...
it was all over.
Come on, uncle!
l'm your friend, cheer up.
You mean it? -Of course, uncle!
So, tell me what's so special
about white women?
Uncle, the fact is...
you can travel the world...
but lndian women are
something else!
Good night, uncle...
sweet dreams.
l think l'll sleep here tonight.
What the--
Let's get to know each
other better...
get under the quilt or
you'll feel cold.
Give me.. -Here come, take..
This is from your aunt..
take this too..
Take it. -Very good, take..
Hold it. -Get going.
Come, let's go in. -Yes, come.
The stuff from Ambala
is the best.
Don't you worry about
the invitations.
l'll get them designed...
lt's my sister's wedding...
it has to be grand!
Omi... Omi dear... -Yes.
Come here, dear.
This is Omi.
Of course we met...
He came to buy underwear.
We're planning their wedding.
Next year, they'll be husband
and wife! -Of course!
lt's true...
l didn't think about it.
And perhaps cute grandchildren
too...
now that would be perfect!
Don't you agree, Lata?
lf we get them married in
the next two months...
they get 10 months to...
you know...
Mom, that's embarrassing!
Jeet, don't be embarrassed!
That's quite natural
after marriage.
l'm looking forward to the day *when
cute little children will call out,
uncle...uncle...'
You should come to London
for the honeymoon!
lt's a romantic city.
l'm sure Harman will
also like it.
lt's a deal then.
You will fund our honeymoon!
Of course!
Did you hear what Harman said?
Well, give me a chance...
and l'll make it a
trip to remember!
l need to make a call...
it's urgent. -Okay.
Have a drink with us.
l'll fix one for you.
Omi, how about a drink?
-Come on...
Take care of uncle.
You're smiling a lot.
Omi...
You okay? -Couldn't be better!
What would you like?
Whiskey.
tell me...
are you interested
in real estate?
As in?
As in... if you want to invest
in lndian real estate...
l'm your guy.
Lovely Realistic Estate!
Thanks mate.
Any mistake?
Of course not! lt's perfect.
Going to London was a smart move.
Look at me, selling underwear.
Once my real estate business
takes off...
l'll be set for life!
Have you thought about
the eatery?
What do you mean?
l mean, l had a good deal but...
your family refused. -Refused?
Lovely, dad is looking for you.
l said... Dad is... -Fine!
And drink less.
We'll catch up later.
-Sure thing.
Dog!
Witch!
Khushi... Look who is here?
Doctor aunty! -Hello!
How are you?
Good... how about you?
l'm good too.
Hello...
it's been so long...
Look at me...
l'm seeing you after
a long time...

Manty bro... take it easy...
-Let's go for a walk.
We sent you here to party?
Look's like you've forgotten us.
That's not true...
Then what is it?
You were hoping Shanty would
forget everything?
You think we're a bunch of fools!
You blew away Shanty's pounds!
l'm working out a deal here...
so l can come back to London.
Has anyone ever escaped Shanty
and Manty's wrath?
Don't l know?
Shanty brother told me
to blow your head off!
What are you waiting for?
Kill me!
But will that bring
back the pounds?
You're a smart...
intelligent dude...
think about it.
Fine!
You aren't such a bad guy either.
Anyway, l'm going to my
village for a few days.
l miss my mom.
How sweet!
l'll talk to Shanty.
-Thanks mate!
You better get the pounds!
-l'm on it!
You see, the next time...
l'll let my gun do the talking!
Wicked bro!
Manty, l'm in awe of you!
Get back to your party!
''My handsome boy, who thinks of you!''
''You're fit to be a groom!''
Bloody joker!
Omi...
listen...
Yes, aunt Lata?
Help him sit.
Can you do me a favour?
Of course!
l've to go see the priest.
Can you give grandpa his
medicines in some time?
Sure but...
l hope l don't get it wrong.
What do l give and when...
-lt's simple.
This is the prescription.
Everything is mentioned on it.
This is the medicine box.
l should get going...
Dalidri, come on! -Let's go.
Hurry up or the market will shut.
Take care. -Sure.
Oh grandpa...
Take it easy, grandpa.
Uncle...
Uncle... Wake up! Please!
Just kill me!
Why can't you guys let
a man rest in peace?
Grandpa has vanished. -What?
Grandpa is missing.
Finally, a relief!
What's wrong with you!
Stop messing around.
l'm shit scared.
l got him to sit on
the commode...
and all l found are his pants!
Relax, Omi... -What the--
l know where he is.
You do? Tell me!
Get the scooter out.
-Come on, hurry up!
Enough with the sermon!
Why are we at the eatery?
Relax! l know where grandpa is.
Oh grandpa...
Let's go!
l told you.
Help him stand up.
The ride back home will be a
pain. -in a minute... hold on.
lf you say so!
Enjoy the silent movie.
Oh grandpa,
you are the eternal romantic!
Don't burn your hand...
come sit with me instead.
l'd set the whole world
on fire for you!
Relax,
the chicken is almost done.
You aren't keeping well yourself.
You can't digest anything,
you've lost your appetite...
Got the digestive mix?
Stop worrying about me,
l'll be fine.
Here's the digestive mix.
Don't lose your heart
when l'm gone.
l've already lost
my heart to you.
My darling.
Stop flirting with me...
l'll come back as a
crow to haunt you.
That smells great.
Really?
What is it?
Try it.
How is it?
l've never cooked before.
This is the most delicious thing
l have had my whole life.
Really? -Yes!
ls it that good?
You are such a good cook...
l suggest you start
your own eatery.
As you wish.
You bake the bread...
and l'll cook the chicken.
l'll feed you every day.
Promise me?
l promise.
Listen...
What will you call the eatery?
You tell me.
Chicken Khurana!
What do you say?
Perfect!
How's the pain now?
l can't feel it anymore...
''When you leave for your
mother's home, behind you, O dear..''
''..l'll follow on my bike.''
''You're under my oath, don't go.''
''Don't leave my abode.''
''For you, dear,
l present love and Chicken Khurana.''
''Love..''
You rascal!
Why did you run away?
How l've missed you!
You little devil...
you sedated me and ran
away with my money.
Rascal!
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Grandpa...
please! -Didn't you miss me?
Of course l did, grandpa...
-Didn't you?
You need to rest, grandpa.
Ouch! That really hurts!
Don't you dare go away from me...
l won't grandpa, l won't...
Stop it, grandpa... please...
Muskaan... sweetheart...
guess who has come back...
guess who has come back...
our Omi is back!
Omi is back!
Promise you won't leave me
again.. -l promise, l won't.
Muskaan, Omi is back...
He is back!
Don't ever leave me...
-Grandpa, you should rest.
Grandpa...
Don't ever leave me again!
Grandpa, what is it...?
l promise... l won't!
Muskaan...
Grandpa... what's happening...
Grandpa...
Uncle!
Grandpa... -Don't leave me.
Grandpa... Uncle, hurry up!
lt's not just the old
man we've lost...
we've lost Chicken Khurana too!
Keep a portrait of a chicken
next to grandpa's...
we'll mourn for both!
Enough nonsense, Titu!
Not today at least!
How much more do l have
to suffer, almighty?
Oh! Grandpa...
Great,
the celebration's already begun!
Where's the old bugger?
grandpa has gone senile.
l'm sorry for your loss.
This way, grandpa.
Why are you sorry?
You're just no fun!
Have you seen Omi?
He must be around.
Everyone is looking for you.
ln a minute.
Grandpa missed you the most.
lt was always, 'Omi this...
Omi that...'
l'm glad he saw you again.
Harman...
You really cared for grandpa.
Thank you.
Grandpa bequeathed most
of his property to you.
Great! Bring out the sweets. Titu!
Except for Muskaan Tractors
which goes to Jeet...
and the eatery 'Chicken
Khurana'...
goes to Omi.
Congratulations!
Here is a copy of the will.
l'll take my leave now.
You didn't eat anything...
Nothing compares to grandpa's
chicken...
but those days will
never come back.
l agree.
See you.
Hold on, Mr. Lawyer...
Omi is a lawyer too... in London.
lf you ever need counsel...
you know where to get it.
That's nice.
Come to my office some day.
Yes... l will...
lt's now or never!
He won't have spare time later.
Thank you.
Omi brother...Yes?
A call for you.
Please hear me out...
l gave those pounds to you
because you were like a brother...
but what a loser you
turned out to be.
l'll pay back every penny!
Not penny, its pounds!
Of course... pounds!
We good now?
Not yet, Omi!
l want my money back.
Or you'll find yourself
in a coffin!
Relax, Shanty...
Now you'll get your
Pounds in cash!
l like the sound of that.
Time is of the essence!
The battle begins!
l get it!
Any problem?
No, no problem.
You studied law in England...Yes.
How many years did it take?
Well...
about three... four years. Okay.
Who was the guy dancing
with you at the party?
An old friend... from school.
Okay
Tell him he better not bring any
weapons in this house again!
l wonder why grandpa passed
the eatery on to you?
Well...
What's done is done!
This guy wants to
buy the eatery?!
Bulls-eye!
Let's go in.
No way, l can't sell the eatery
to this scoundrel.
Let's try somewhere else.
Take it easy, Omi.
Only this scoundrel can
pay you your price.
Be practical. Let'go.
What do you want me to say?
Tell me...
l've already said it, remember?
l offered his uncle a deal
but he got worked up.
What do l care?
Keep selling your tractors.
Don't take it personally, Omi.
The fact is...
your uncle has no business sense.
l'll give you ten million
rupees! What?
Ten million rupees!
But you have to get me the recipe
for Chicken Khurana.
Now... that's called business.
You're a star, brother.
l'm impressed.
You never cease to amaze me!
Come here...
Don't sweet talk me...
it'll get you nowhere.
You'll be left selling underwear.
Next.
What's the problem?
Why don't you tell me yours?
We don't treat animals here.
That was really funny, Harman.
Will you at least listen to me!
Harman...
please listen to me.
l'm listening.
l need your help.
For what?
l want to make Chicken Khurana.
You know...
get the eatery going again.
lt was grandpa's last wish.
That's very sweet...
what do you want from me?
l can't cook.
No big deal.
Ask aunt Lata for help.
No...no way!
l want to surprise the family.
Please don't tell anyone.
ln case you haven't noticed...
l'm a doctor, not a chef.
Oh please!
l remember the taste of parathas
you'd make for me.
Please help me...
as a friend?
Friend
Since when are we friends?
Well, l've been a friend as
far as l can remember...
why don't you start from today.
You are such a fake!
Now that you want something,
you're flashing that looney smile!
l swear, you are the most
selfish person, ever!
l know we have a history but...
you've got to stop living
in the past!
l've apologised to you.
What else do you want me to do?
Should l jump off the cliff?!
Never mind...
l'll do without your help.
l came to you because of grandpa.
And what's with the staring
all the time?
Grow up!
Lower your voice,
this is a hospital.
Sir, just a friendly warning...
she bribed her way to
become a doctor.
She herself needs to be checked.
Omi!
Hurry up... get yourself treated!
''lnky, pinky, ponkey..''
''..father had a donkey..''
''lnky, pinky, ponkey..''
''..father had a donkey..''
''Keep flying higher..''
''Whether it's chillies
or cumin seeds.''
''Tangy or sweet.''
''Test it to find the recipe, O boy!''
''O sister!''
''O aunty!''
''Try it out..''
''Try it out..''
''O boy!''
How the hell did you do this,
grandpa?!
Bloody hell!
Get started, dammit!
You don't have it in you.
You know...
l'm here only because of grandpa.
What's this?
You bought the whole market?
Chicken Khurana is
no ordinary dish.
You can't even cut tomatoes! And
you're attempting Chicken Khurana?!
Move it... not your cup of tea.
Fine!
l'm not your servant.
Pass the onions.
Here... you try...
Let me show you...
nice and firm.
lf you had learnt from grandpa,
you wouldn't need my help.
lf he had taught me...
l'd gladly learn.
Now time to put the chicken
in the pressure cooker.
Your grandma was very beautiful.
l didn't bribe my way
to become a doctor.
Fine, l'm sorry.
You know l didn't mean it.
But how -What do you mean?
You struggled through
high school.
We'd cheat on the exams
together... remember?
Bad company, l guess...
got rid of it at the
right time...
Right...
And you...
sweet-talking liar to
smooth-talking lawyer... How?
When you're really determined,
nothing is impossible!
When did l ever lie to you?
Never mind...
Listen...
Tell me something...
no hook ups after l left?
The whole town is crazy about me!
ls it?
But once you've tasted dirt,
you really wise up!
Poor you.
There's no remedy.
Men are inherently untrustworthy.
What the--
Relax,
it's only the pressure cooker.
The chicken is ready.
Looks beautiful.
lt's hot.
Not bad...
Nothing like grandpa's!
We could try again tomorrow...
Harman...
Thanks!
Uncle...
Uncle...
what's wrong?
l'm trying to get rid of the
awful taste of my sister's cooking!
l'd like one too!
l feel miserable today.
l really miss the old fellow.
The poor guy would sit
in the corner all day.
When everyone abandoned me,
he allowed me to live here.
A real brave heart!
And then, there was his chicken!
Oh the taste...
l always wonder what the
secret ingredient was!
What the hell was it, grandpa?
Omi...
Why don't you sleep here tonight?
Those were the good old days.
Grandpa did all the
work himself...
he let us hang around.
Singing, eating, laughing,
having a good time.
Grandpa bought all
his clothes here.
He had good taste in clothes and
even better when it came to food!
l thought it was pomegranate
seeds!
What say?
l am a pure vegetarian.
lt's a wild guess but...
l think it was garlic.
''O boy!''
''O sister!''
Every time he passed by he
would call out to me.
He'd prepare a special
paneer dish for me...
with lots of cardamom.
Once he accidently told
me the secret...
Asafoetida...
Every brick in your house
has gone from my kiln.
My father was close to grandpa.
There was a delightful
tangy flavour...
it could be tamarind.
Omi...
Where are you going?
Thought l'd go to the temple.
Temple? -Yes.
With whom? -Lovely.
He was the only one who truly
understood my pain.
There was no drinking
partner like him.
he drank like a fish,
and never got drunk!
He knew everything about cattle.
And l mean everything!
l'd say even more than
the cattle themselves!
What was it...
The only thing that comes to
my mind is black pepper.
''This confusion, this helplessness..''
''Search for it..
it's stuck like a bone..''
He proposed to me while we were
having Chicken Khurana.
l was so lost in the taste
that l said yes.
Next thing... we were married.
''Come along, it's deja vu.''
Chicken Khurana was our hang out!
We'd celebrate with grandpa's
chicken...
and if we'd lose, your grandpa
offered it as encouragement!
l think it was... vinegar.
l would say whole red chillies.
l think it was brown
mustard seeds.
l can be sure of one thing...
he served it with sweetness.
''O brother!''
''O woman!''
How about some asafoetida?
Go ahead.
You look charged up.
Wait and watch...
Today we'll find Chicken Khurana!
lt seems better than yesterday...
Some cumin seeds?
Sure.
Make it your way.
Ladle?
Now where did l keep the ladle...
Here it is. -Thanks!
Salt...
Let me take a look.
lt'll be fine by morning.
Does it hurt?
What is it?
Tell me!
Do you remember the time when
you sat on a hot clay oven?
You couldn't sit in the
classroom for months.
lt's not that funny.
Crazy girl!
You still got the burn marks?
Take a look.
How is it?
lt's tasty.
lt's good. -lt's good but...
it's not Chicken Khurana.
lt's good, isn't it?
lt's terrible!
Well...
the cumin seeds are burnt...
the chicken is still raw...
and the spices aren't roasted...
but it's good.
Wear the helmet.
This fishbowl?
Yes!
Let's go!
''Your gently sly smile..''
How much longer?
About half an hour...
Are you sure?
l suggest you sell the scooter
and buy a bicycle.
Tea...
l took a sip from this one.
You still slurp while
drinking tea.
You know, l've been dying to
drink the lassi from the old market.
Oh...
How about tomorrow?
l have to go to the hospital.
You can always bunk!
lt's not like the patients will
die if you don't make it.
What say?
-You always make me bunk.
Only tomorrow...
''Your gently sly smile.''
''lt makes me blush pink..''
''Your sly smile..''
l'll end up dreaming
of lassi tonight.
Relax, it's only lassi.
The little things you
miss in London.
Stop!
What is it?
Just walk it up from here
someone might see us.
Drop me a little further.
No way... are you nuts?
Fine.
Don't turn it off.
Here's your fishbowl.
Bye.
Bye.
Tomorrow... 2 o'clock.
''The bond is true..

You've added a lot
of chilli today.
Yes, from the market.
lt tastes really good tonight.
Don't you like it?
lt's nowhere close to
Chicken Khurana.
But, it's not bad.
Well, at least you're trying.
And along the way,
you've learnt to cook.
We will try again tomorrow.
Forget it.
We are wasting time...
it was a stupid idea...
really stupid idea.
Forget it!
You really won't try
again tomorrow?
No.
Here's your rickety scooter.
And don't ride too fast.
lf you crash into somebody,
you'll have to treat them yourself!
Harman... what's wrong?
What is it?
Thank you.
When is your phony God-woman
aunt arriving?
l've got cramps in my leg.
lt's only been ten minutes
and you've got cramps?
Do me a favour...
please be courteous to her.
We'll see who is rude!
Finally... there she is!
Long live the saint!
Make way for the holy goddess!
Bless you all!
l hope you had a pleasant
journey.
lt was alright...
but the roads here are terrible!
l apologise for the discomfort.
lt's given me a backache.
l'm at your service.
l've kept a room ready
for you to rest.
Who is this?
This is Jeet. -Jeet?
My son, Jeet.
He was a little kid when
l last saw him.
He's all grown up now.
Bless me... -Bless you!
Oh god! ls that a marble eye?!
Move aside!
Bless me too... -Sure...
who the hell is this?
He is Lata's younger brother.
He lives with us.
He is mentally unstable.
So l've been right?
About what?
The disease runs in the family.
Let's get some rest.
Dalidri, get something to drink.
Lata, come, my darling...
What time is the memorial
service?
Don't worry about it.
We should be done by
midday tomorrow.
Who is that?
That's Omi, my nephew.
He is difficult to deal with.
Difficult is fine...
but smoking?
He is out of control.
Enough with the flowers!
Holy cow!
Onions should be finely
chopped...
Can l help you with anything,
Jassi brother?
Don't worry, Jeet.
Everything is under control.
My only request is the food
should be finger-licking good.
All hail the saint...
l surrender myself to you!
Keep walking...
the devotees are waiting...
Please put in a good word for me.
l need some air.
Tell them l've gone to the loo.
Bless you!
Keep smoking...
keep smoking...
Your grandpa was really
proud of you!
You are just like him...
a rascal.
Thank you for the compliment.
What's bothering you?
Nothing.
Life is filled with misery...
Everyone here is suffering...
and they think l'm
the miracle pill.
Bloody morons!
So,
she is the cause of your misery.
She is Jeet's fiancée.
What a bummer!
l think you two would
make a cute couple.
Here...
Not good enough for me.
Keep smiling, my boy...
A smile looks good on you.
Keep smiling!
What sermon did you deliver in
grandpa's room last night?
l was right.
You are just like your grandpa...
a rascal!
The disease runs in the family.
l was looking for
his medicine box.
Why?
lt doesn't matter...
l couldn't find it.
What if l get it for you?
Can you?
Here you are.
How the hell did you get it?
l've had it since the day
grandpa passed away.
This is it!
The same smell!
You also have digestion problems?
Give me a cigarette, quick!
''l follow you..''
''l've become a crazy chick.''
Now this is good...
organic!
Weed?!
lt's the miracle medicine...
it lights up the path!
But grandpa used this
as a digestive.
Everyone has their shortcomings,
my boy.
You aren't the only
rascal around!
And nobody knows about it!
lgnorance is bliss, my boy.
lt's bliss.
Have a drag.
No, thanks. l don't do it.
Just one drag...
-l said l don't...
Try it my boy!
Smoke away your misery!
Be a sport!
What the-- -Hey...
''O my beloved..''
''..l can't live without you.''
''When l saw you..''
''..l felt like l saw the world.''
''l thought that..''
''..l'll visit my
maternal home tomorrow.''
Chicken Khurana!
Chicken?
This is eggplant stir-fry but...
it does smell like
Chicken Khurana!
l bet my boom box that this
is Chicken Khurana!
Can you not smell it?
Hemraj... Lata...
lt's grandpa's spirit at work...
This is a miracle.
lt smells the same!
To hell with the smell...
just dig in!
''When you leave for
your maternal home..''
''l'll follow you..''
''..on my bike.''
''You can buy new cosmetics.''
''You can buy a new dress.''
''l'll bribe you with new gifts.''
''You're under my oath, don't go..''
''Don't leave my abode..''
''For you, O dear,
l present love and Chicken Khurana.''
''Love, love..''
''..and Chicken Khurana.''
''How can l live without seeing you?''
''How can l live without
cooking for you?''
''My days won't pass without you..''
They insulted me...
they refused to let me in!
lf it weren't for you,
l'd have shot the old guy.
That's my uncle...
watch your mouth.
Bad mood, huh?
But not my problem.
Out with the pounds.
l'm flying back to London
in a few days.
You'll get the money there.
Don't you act smart now!
No more grace time.
l want the money now or your
uncle bites the first bullet.
How dare you stare at me?
Bloody loser!
Dare you touch my family...
l swear,
your gun will talk to you.
Get lost!
You'll pay for this, Omi...
You'll pay for this, Omi...
Get lost!
You'll pay for this, Omi.
You're messing with
the wrong guy.
How dare you hit me?
Now your days are numbered!
Are the documents in order,
Lovely?
l've checked the documents.
Omi, go ahead and sign.
Just do it and give
him the recipe.
We need to get your tickets too.
Don't you need to get back?
Go on, sign.
One last time...
Here you are.
Congratulations!
That's great.
Half the job is done.
Now, why don't you hand over
that elusive recipe?
Of course! Come on, Omi.
Start with... ginger, onions...
That goes into almost everything.
What's wrong with you?!
Tell him, Omi...
Chicken...
Omi...
Speak up.
What's wrong, buddy?
Oh...
Here you go, feast your eyes.
l have your dream...
you have my Pounds...
Return my Pounds and
live your dream!
Satisfied?
Pepper... ginger...
garlic has to be there...
cumin seeds...
Aw shucks!
What the hell are you doing?
What's this?!
The eatery belonged to the
Khurana's and will remain with them.
What the-- Lovely? -Hold on...
l'll sort this out.
Omi, you're turning your back
on ten million rupees!
l really don't care!
What will you do with
that run-down eatery?
lt's worthless!
lt will flourish again.
You want to give up paradise
to cook chicken?!
Have you lost it?
There's no place like home.
And there's no such thing
as a menial job.
The truth is,
it should make you happy.
What rubbish is this?!
The man whose chicken curry
drove people crazy...
was crazy about your
lentils in butter.
But as soon as the riches came in the
door, the taste went out the window!
The love went missing.
Bloody hell!
l just gave you the secret
ingredient free.
lt would be smart
to write it down.
See you, Lovely.
You're a scam artist!
Get up and get lost.
Go back to selling underwear!
That's the only thing
you're good for.
l'll make sure l bury your
reputation, mark my words!
Stand up... and get lost!
How dare you comment
on my underwear?!
People swear by the
underwear l sell.
A dozen holes appear
in as many days!
Underwear dealer!
Watch what you say!
Go to hell!
You go to hell!
Scoundrel... rascal... dog!
lf l ever see you again,
l'll break your legs!
Harman.
Rest for a while... l'll be back.
l'm cooking for the family...
at the eatery.
And...
lt will be nice to
have you there.
Omi...
Omi, this is the ladies ward.
l'll see you.
My helmet?
Thank you.
You can wipe those tears.
l'm here to help you.
''Your gently sly smile..''
''..your face blushes pink..''
''Your sly smile.. lights up..''
''Reveal it slightly..''
''..your sly smile.. lights up..''
''Slowly.. unite me with my beloved.''
''l would lay down my life for you,
happily.''
''l would lay down my life for you,
happily.''
Why are we here?
l don't have a clue.
Jeet, what's going on?
-Did he tell you?
No, he didn't.
Who cares!
This looks good!
Omi, what is this all about?
l've cooked Chicken Khurana
for all of you.
Have a seat, Dalidri.
You know how to make it?
Well, l'm still learning.
ls this a joke, Omi?
Of course, he is kidding.
Doesn't the smell give it away?
Enough with the questions.
Let's dig in!
Just a minute, uncle.
l have to say something.
l'm dying of hunger...
l'm not lying.
The thing is even l
won't lie today.
l am...
l am not a lawyer, l don't
have a house in London...
and l don't have any money.
Actually...
Actually, l am nothing.
l'm neither a good brother, nor
a good son, nor a good friend.
l've never cared for
anyone in my life.
l've only managed
to hurt everyone.
after 10 long years...
your welcome was like
that of a war hero!
You overlooked all
my shortcomings.
Stop it, Omi.
Jeet, let me say it. l don't know if
l'll ever muster the courage again.
You see...
l was about to sell
our eatery today.
This is who l really am.
l'm not worthy of your love.
And to tell you the truth... l
don't deserve this eatery at all.
lt belongs to you.
And l am... l am going back.
Omi, my brother...
don't say that.
Listen...
Why did you...?
You're still an idiot.
But, uncle...
To hell with your excuses!
l have decided!
lf you ever step out of
the house again...
trust me, l will break your legs!
Uncle l...
Don't ever think l'm
not your father!
l've got used to having both my
sons at the dinner table now.
Even l am fed up of
eating on my own.
You better not go anywhere...
never ever!
l won't be able to take it.
Come!
Come here, my dear...
This thing tastes really good.
Save the drama for later,
have the chicken.
lt's getting cold.
Enough nonsense, Titu!
Sit down, Omi.
You too, dear.
lt may not be Chicken Khurana...
but it sure is Chicken
Omi Khurana!
He-man, l'm coming back for sure!
You're crazy, Titu!
Listen... while we are at it...
even l want to state a truth.
The truth is...
l'm not a lunatic.
Let us decide that, Titu.
Enjoy your meal.
As you wish!
But l was brave enough
to be honest.
l'd like to clear my mind too...
Of course!
You see...
l don't know how to cook.
Tell us something new!
That's common knowledge.
Enough nonsense, Titu!
What about you?
Yes...
Since you are insisting,
l'll tell you the truth.
Remember you would send home
cooked food for me?
Yes...
l never ate that.
l'd have the community
lunch at the temple.
Nothing can beat that!
Dalidri...
what's the matter?
Well...
l love all of you very much.
How sweet! My dear son.
Today is a good day to come
out with the truth, Jeet.
What is your secret?
Secret? -What is your secret?
Come out with it.
He has a secret...
l'm sure of it.
What's wrong?
Out with it!
l want to--
-How long will you hide it?
Jeet? What's wrong?
Jeet...
What's up with him?
Finish the food first! -Jeet...
Where is everyone going?
Finish the food first!
Shama...
Shama...
Shama...
Shama!
Stop it, Jeet.
Shama!
What are you doing?
You'll wake up the neighbourhood!
Sha...
lt's me...
Have you lost your mind, Jeet?
[ln Bengali]
''You're my poetry..''
''..the melody of my song..''
Bengali gentleman!
''My dream.. my desire..''
''..is to be with you forever.''
What? -A Bengali song.
Bengali song...
''You're the melody of my song..''
Bengali song...
''My dream..''
Shama...
Shama...
What are you doing, Jeet?
My life is futile without you.
What are you doing?!
Listen..
You know how much you mean to me.
Every moment spent
with you is treasured.
But.. l'm not worthy
of you and your family.
Harman.. she's a nice girl,
if you marry her..
No, Shama!
l've lived a meaningless
life all these years.
l can't live without you.
No, dear..
l want to confess to
my family that...
we love each other.
l cannot lie to them anymore.
lt's very sad that you couldn't
confide in us.
You thought we wouldn't
understand?
lt's alright, Jeet.
We might be old...
but we sure aren't old-fashioned.
We have enough love in our heart
to accept Shama into our family.
Shama...
Bless you.
Mom!
Oh no!
l can't bless you! l'm younger!
Bless you, my son.
Omi...
Come here...
Harman, please forgive us.
l don't know how to face
your parents...
lt'll be good.
Everything will fall into place.
Don't you worry, auntyji.
l'll talk to them.
Have all of you gone blind?
There's a fine young man standing
in front of you.
Charming, handsome...
can't you see?
That is a brilliant idea!
For the first time your
words make sense, Titu!
Omi...
will you marry Harman?
As you wish.
My dear!
Dad...
Khushi...
Khushi, come here.
Wow!
Such a sweet and intelligent
child.
She's already calling Jeet 'dad'.
Kids these days have
become smarter.
Well, mom, she is my daughter.
Of course,
now she is your daughter.
Goes without saying.
No, mom...
what l mean is... Khushi is ours!
What?
Auntyji!
Let's take her inside.
Lift her... hurry up.
Omi...
She's in shock. -Mom!
Unbelievable!
He raided the soldier's bunker!
What did you find out?
Why are you staring at me,
like a dimwit!
Go and find out! Go!

''Open the windows..''

''..you've sure got me hooked.''
''Speak your heart, O girl..''
''Speak your heart, O girl..''
''Speak your heart, O girl..''
All you could find is that phony
saint for the inauguration?
lt's alright, aunt Lata.
Hello Khushi...
Khushi, how are you?
Look your friends are there.
Bye.
So, what have you decided?
l'm still thinking...
But your folks have agreed!
They have agreed,
but l'll have to put up with you.
Stop pretending...
you know there are lots
of girls here.
Dare you look at anyone...
l'll tear your eyes out!
Go ahead.

Remember me, Omi?
Shanty,
this is between you and me.
Don't drag them into this.
l have your pounds.
lt's not about pounds anymore.
lt's about respect.
Hold on a minute... -Uncle...
l'll call the cops...
Get lost, you loser.
-Dad, are you alright?
Take it easy, that's my uncle.
l don't give a damn!
Let's step aside and talk, okay?
Step back, Omi.
Who wants to get the
first bullet?
Who are they?
Uncle...
Uncle...
Stop, he has a gun.
Uncle... -Someone stop him!
Someone stop him! -Titu?
Titu?
How dare you... you bloody...
Manty... take it easy.
-Who the hell is he?
l said, take it easy!
You bloody traitor!
You went away, leaving me here?
l'm no traitor, Titu.
Enough! -Please listen to me...
Please listen to me...
Do you remember Ruby?
That hot chick?
You had a thing for her...
and so did l...
lt was like a Mexican
shoot out...
one of us had to go...
So, l went away.
Told you l had a reason.
Guess what...
Ruby turned out to be a guy!
Sorry, Titu.
Trust me,
l never forgot about you.
And you never will.
What are you doing?
lt's a real gun.
Let's go for the shock
treatment...
Titu come on...
-But first a bullet!
Titu... don't...
Bloody hell!
