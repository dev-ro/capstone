Hi.
Oh, Grace, I'm sorry.
I thought I heard you moving around
in there. Um, listen, I can't decide.
- Did you hear about the callback?
- No. Not yet.
I got some new head shots though.
- What happened to your furniture?
- I had to sell it all.
Even your bed?
Yeah, I'm not gonna need it.
What do you think?
I liked the old one.
I still have it
taped up on my fridge.
I like that one.
It's more... you.
More me?
How more me?
Well, all of these, it's like you're
acting. This one is, like, you.
The real you.
The real person.
You have beautiful eyes.
This one it is.
- Thank you, Grace.
- You're welcome.
What is it?
Is it Neely?
He frightens me.
Why does he wear that thing?
- Did someone beat him up?
- Shh! He's a freak.
He's been following me around
the neighborhood. I swear to God.
Did you know that
the landlord came by yesterday?
And he knocked on your door
for, like, five minutes.
I know. I was in there.
Were you?
Listen, thank you.
Thank you for coming in. I'm sorry
if I've disturbed your beauty sleep.
No. John,
I could lend you the money.
I don't... Are you kidding?
Come on. I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
Things are happening for me now.
I mean, I really nailed that audition.
It's a great part.
No. They'll call you.
I know they will.
You'll be great in the role.
A real leading man.
It's Neely,
your next-door neighbor.
What do you want?
- Hurry, please.
- You can't come in here, Neely.
- Close the door. He may be coming.
- 'He' who?
- You can't come in here.
- Close the door.
I've been authorized
to offer you a proposition.
Please sit down, my friend.
This is very serious.
I'm not your friend, Neely.
I got problems of my own.
Oh, we know you have problems.
We know many things, my friend.
Listen carefully.
You must take this blue suitcase to
Baker, California.
There, within 24 hours,
a trucker named Cowboy will arrive
to take the blue suitcase from you.
If you will do this,
we will give you...
twenty-five thousand dollars.
That's absurd, Neely.
You gotta go.
John, there is a way out.
There is a gateway to the other side.
I could help you find that door.
What size shoe do you wear?
- Good-bye, Neely.
- Hey, they come at night, you know.
- Through these very walls.
- It's been fun, Neely, but you gotta go.
- Good-bye, Neely.
- Here's what we know.
Your stage name is John Person.
We know it's not your real name.
Ten years ago you came to Los Angeles
with a dream of becoming a movie star.
But after only two commercials and
one sitcom that was soon canceled,
your dream fell into the abyss.
Your life became empty.
Your existence, futile.
I've seen you following me.
Oh, many people
have been watching you.
We had hoped not to have to
delve into more personal issues,
but, if you insist.
This morning at 10:17...
you lay here on this very floor
masturbating into a sock...
while fantasizing about this
particular lingerie model on page 32.
We've already examined
the sperm samples, John.
- Sperm samples?
- You're a very healthy man.
- Neely, who are 'we'?
- There are many questions I cannot answer.
Look,
if you will deliver
this suitcase,
we are prepared to give you...
$25,000.
- I don't believe you.
- Fine.
Shall I then describe an incident...
last week involving
Vaseline applied liberally...
No.
We are prepared...
upon your acceptance,
of course...
to pay your back rent
of $1,875...
and to give you $1,000
to cover your expenses.
Wait. All I have to do...
is deliver this suitcase,
up to Cowboy?
A gun?
This blue suitcase
must not be opened.
If anyone attempts to
open, steal,
or defame this suitcase in any manner,
you must defend it with your life.
Jesus, Neely.
I'm not doing this.
It's a very simple job, my friend. But it
does have very serious responsibilities.
So, what is it? Is it drugs or money?
What's in there?
I cannot reveal the contents.
And you have got to leave here
by 10 o'clock tonight.
No way,
I gotta wait for a phone call.
I had a callback audition. I nailed it.
I got this part. I can feel it.
You have no messages.
That sound familiar, John?
Don't you think they might've
called you back by now?
I'll do it...
for $27,987 and six cents.
That's my debt.
That takes me back to zero.
What you're asking me for...
could cost me my life.
Well, make a decision.
That's my deal.
Whew.
You drive a hard bargain.
My friend.
Grace, it's John.
Are you skipping out?
No. No.
I need you to do me a big favor.
This is my back rent.
Give it to the landlord, okay?
I wrote down the number where I'm gonna be,
but don't call it unless it's an emergency.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
I just have to courier this suitcase
out to the desert. It won't be long.
- A delivery this late?
- Yeah.
It's Neely. Okay, he hired me.
It's like a freelance thing.
- Neely? John, what's in the suitcase?
- I don't know.
- This can't be a good idea.
- I need to do this.
- It's one fell swoop.
- You don't need to do this.
John, what about that callback?
You said you'd start rehearsals right away.
- Grace, I can check my messages.
- A gun?
- John, what on earth's going on?
- Don't worry, this isn't a real gun.
It's just... It's a prop.
'Cause I have to rehearse for the...
John, I'm worried.
- There's something wrong.
- There's nothing wrong.
This is a simple courier job.
I do this every day.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
- John Parson?
- I'm John Person.
He described you very well.
Six-foot, 220, a big head,
average-looking...
- I knew it was you the second I saw you.
- Who?
I'm Elron.
That's my name.
I'm the night manager.
Welcome to the Royal Hawaiian.
No, I meant...
I mean, who described me?
Oh. Fella called Cowboy. He come here
looking for you about an hour ago.
Uh, mean-looking dude.
Wears this stupid long, black duster.
- Wait, Cowboy was here already?
- Already here and already gone.
Well, was he angry? I mean,
I was supposed to meet him.
That guy's a friggin' weirdo.
Said he'd be back in
a couple of three days.
- 'A couple of three days'?
- That's exactly what he said.
Hey, um, check this out.
Welcome.
Wel, welcome...
to the hotel.
That's excellent.
Um, I'm gonna need a room.
Oh, okay. That's a little
Hawaiian space jam...
I've been practicing.
Um, okay.
You're, uh...
You're not John Law, are you?
- John Law? No.
- Then you're into hookers?
Hookers?
We got a regular rotation
come around to service truckers.
A couple of lookers too.
Oh, Candy's due tomorrow night.
I got her Polaroids right here.
You can have a... that. Here.
I'll, uh, give it
some thought. Thanks.
Got a sign-up sheet right here.
All right. Okay, here's your key.
Is there a place around here a
guy can get a drink this late?
Damn. That's the exact same question
that weirdo Cowboy dude said.
- I thought that you said he was...
- Going to LA?
Yeah. He-He... Well, he did. He was.
But first he said he was parched.
That's exactly what he said.
'Parched'.
Well, where did you send him?
The only place to go
for a drink around here...
- is Pikes across the road.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, uh, Jonathan?
We-We got free Joe and doughnuts
every morning in the lobby, 6 to 9.
You just missed him.
Left five minutes ago.
Did he say he was coming
back here or anything?
He didn't talk to me. He just sat
down there at the end of the bar.
But you could tell by the look in his
eyes, a crazy motherfucker.
I'll have a gin and tonic.
A double.
Sorry 'bout the satellite.
Comes and goes.
Got some change. You got quite a
selection here. Mostly country...
Come on. Tell me where!
It's in the car.
The suitcase is in the car.
- Shut the fuck up and don't move!
- He won't shoot ya.
- Where is she? I'll kill this guy.
- She doesn't wanna see you.
- But why?
- She's all talked out, Randy.
- Stella, please!
- Don't 'Stella, please' me, Randy.
And leave the poor guy alone.
You don't even know him.
- Sorry, dude.
- Now go home, Randy, and get some sleep.
Don't make me call
the highway patrol.
Look, will you tell
sweetie that I love her?
She knows you love her, Randy.
- Will you tell her that I dropped by?
- I'll tell her you dropped by.
- Sorry about that.
- Tell her that this time I'm really sorry.
Randy, put the gun away.
It scares people.
Dude, look, I'm really sorry.
It's just that sometimes
women can drive us crazy.
Look, I'm gonna buy you a drink.
Stella, I'm gonna buy him a drink.
Can you put it
on my tab, please?
Look, I'm gonna
introduce you to Baker.
It's really
a nice little truck stop.
My name is Randy,
and I'm sorry, dude.
Randy, go on.
- Look, this won't happen again. Okay.
- Okay.
I'm sorry about that.
Randy gets a little tripped out sometimes.
Lovers' quarrel kind of thing.
Anything else?
Hey, mister.
I got your wallet.
Stella sent me over
from the bar.
Thank you.
She found it under the stool you
were sitting on. Must've dropped it.
I didn't even know it was gone.
Got an awful lot
of money in there.
You know, you oughta be more
careful with all that money.
- Right. So what's your name?
- Ruthie.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ruthie.
I didn't see you over at the bar.
Well, if that's it then.
Hey, don't let all that money burn
a hole in your goddamn pocket.
Hey, Ruthie?
I'm sorry. Here you go.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you very much.
That's all right. I know you're not
some big high roller or anything.
- You live around here?
- If you call it living.
Hey, John-Boy.
Saved ya a claw
and a cup of Joe.
Damn truckers would take
every last one if they could.
- Hey, these you?
- Yeah, those are me.
- I'm an actor.
- An actor?
Damn.
Well.
Well, you're good-looking.
Hey. They filmed
a porno here once.
Right here in this very room.
And, uh, I got to watch.
One word.
Bullet train.
Could be two words too.
It's gonna make a ghost
town outta this town.
You know, I saw some surveyors out
there in the desert last night.
- You know what they were doing?
- Bullet train?
Surveying for the bullet train.
You ask me...
this bullet train is one
big cover-up for the FBI.
You see too many alien
sightings along the highway,
so you know what
they're gonna do?
They're gonna put all these
people on the bullet train.
They're gonna liquor 'em up and
shoot 'em out across the desert.
Ain't nobody gonna see
them UFOs.
Nobody but us locals.
And everybody thinks
we're fuckin' stupid.
Hey, check this out.
That's an alien claw hand.
Very rare.
I found it in the lake bed.
Used to be pure black,
but, well,
now it's kind of...
I'm gonna shellac it.
Looks kind of like
a-a chicken's foot.
Yeah.
Tasted like chicken too.
Do you know they will
steal your sperm?
And they can take a woman's
eggs right out of her neck.
Elron says that they're harvesting
eggs and sperm to start a master race.
Uh, could you pass
the salt, Dan?
How'd you know my name was Dan?
Hey.
- Come here a minute.
- Ruthie, right?
Do me a favor.
Buy me some beer.
I don't know.
How old are you?
Asshole Eddie in there won't sell to me,
as if there could be a cop for 100 miles.
Would I be contributing to
the delinquency of a minor?
Look, I'm not asking you
for conversation.
I'm asking you
to buy me some beer.
The way I figure, I did you a good deed
last night. You could repay the favor.
All right.
All right, sure.
Okay, I need a 12-pack of High Life
and a bottle of Jack.
- Okay.
- Oh, and a can of whip cream.
For later.
Oh, man, this is fucking nuts.
What am I doing?
Here you go.
And I got ya...
I got you a rose too.
Sort of like
a thank you for yesterday.
It's, uh...
It's the last one they had,
but with a little bit of love,
it might come back to life.
Hey, uh,
you got an extra sixer there.
Yeah. You get kind of thirsty
waiting around in a town like this.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Hey, um,
you wanna go up to Devil's Crest,
maybe drink some beers?
Nah, I-I really shouldn't.
I got a job to do here,
- and I shouldn't leave.
- Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm supposed to
meet this guy,
and it just wouldn't be good
if I missed him.
All right.
See ya around then.
Thanks, though.
Nice to see you again.
You know what?
Hang on a second.
I will go with you.
What the hell, you only live once, right?
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
I'm a virgin.
I intend to stay that way.
Hey, I'm in the middle
of nowhere here.
I could use a new friend.
Come on. Live a little.
All right.
But you gotta promise...
that you're not gonna hit on me,
'cause you ain't getting anywhere.
I can promise you that.
I promise.
I mean, even if
I get all drunk...
and just beg you to fuck me?
Sometimes I just get all horned
up and I just can't help myself.
- Scout's honor.
- Are you really a Boy Scout?
Are you really a virgin?
Sometimes down in the lake bed they
find, uh, motor homes,
like trucks and cars,
but no people anywhere.
Just, poof... vanished.
They don't find 'em, huh?
- They make the jump.
- The jump? What's the jump?
Well, the lake bed is a jump
station for the UFOs.
It's where they come to abduct
travelers and leave others behind.
Right. Right.
It's kind of like an
interplanetary truck stop.
- Yeah, right.
- A gateway. A crossover.
And what? People just vanish out
there in the middle of nowhere?
You really believe this?
Why don't you go build us a
fire, Boy Scout, huh?
Okay.
Take it easy, kid.
Take it easy.
- That's powerful stuff there.
- Mm-hmm.
That's firewater.
There we go. There we go.
Okay. Everybody gets
the finger in this town.
Oh, here, here.
I was wondering what this was for.
You should try it.
Yeah. Maybe if you clean that bottle off,
I'll try it.
Oh. There,
for the dead homies.
Open your mouth and close your eyes,
I'm gonna give you a big surprise.
Open your mouth, close your eyes,
I'm gonna give you a big surprise.
I love mixing the whipped cream
with the Jack.
- Oh, yeah, it's great stuff.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, it just gets all sweet
and sticky at the same time.
I know.
Wow, hey, easy with that stuff. Okay.
Take it easy with that stuff. Seriously.
Okay.
Take it easy.
I don't feel so good. I think you
should take me back to the bar.
To the bar?
No, I'm taking you home, young lady.
No, the bar is my home.
Stella's my mom.
- Tell me you didn't.
- I didn't. I swear.
- We just knocked back a couple of beers.
- Mister,
Ruthie could drink
a six-pack for breakfast.
She obviously had more
than a couple of beers.
Mommy.
Baby.
- I love you.
- I love you too, sweetie.
We better get her out of here before
Randy sees her. He's a little upset.
They were supposed to get
together, talk things out.
- Randy?
- Randy.
He says his heart's about broke.
You know he's been a
little unhinged lately.
Yeah, I'd say.
That Cowboy guy came
back looking for you.
Cowboy, was here?
I sent him back
over to the motel.
Blood?
All up and down the arms
of that stupid black duster.
And that Stetson... the guy's like
a walking Western wear store.
But I told you to
tell him to stay.
Well... You don't tell
that maniac nothing.
You really should have
been here.
When I told him you were gone,
I thought he was gonna kill me.
Anyway, he went off with Candy.
Then he left
about 10 minutes ago.
So, you were messing around
with Ruthie? Oh, goddamn.
- I sure hope Randy don't find out.
- What did Cowboy say?
He said Candy gives
a damn nice hummer.
What did Cowboy say about me?
Oh. Oh, he said he'd be back soon and
that you'd better be here, or else.
Or else?
He left you this.
Said to look after it for him.
He wanted me to emphasize,
do not open the bowling ball
bag under any circumstances.
Oh. And you got an emergency message
earlier from a girl called Grace.
Murdered?
The landlord found him in
his apartment this morning.
It's horrible. Where are you?
Agent Banks is asking about you.
Agent Banks?
He's with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
I mean, first Neely's shot...
murdered... then you disappear.
I didn't disappear. I'm right here.
What did you tell him?
Nothing. But he keeps asking
about the blue suitcase.
It seems very important.
John, what's in that thing?
Don't tell him anything, all right.
I knew it.
This is not good.
I'm afraid.
Something bad is going to happen.
- Why did you have to get mixed up in this?
- Grace, I didn't kill Neely.
I know that,
but Agent Banks doesn't.
John, you need to come back
to clear your name.
To clear my name?
Wh-What am I, a suspect?
Well, he's very suspicious.
And it's the way Neely was murdered.
First, they shot him, then they cut
off his head, John, and it's missing!
Neely's head is gone.
John? John?
Are you there?
Who is it?
Hi. I'm Candy.
I'm working here at this motel.
Can I talk to you?
Hey. Is that Cowboy
a friend of yours?
No. I don't know him. I was supposed
to meet the guy, but I missed him.
He's got me freaked out.
I think he might be really dangerous.
- Dangerous? Dangerous how?
- Can I come in for a minute?
- Yeah, sure. Sorry. Come on.
- I don't have a lot of time.
My next appointment
is in 10 minutes.
You'd be surprised at how tired
your feet get from fucking.
Yeah, I never really
thought about it.
Wow, I love bowling.
So, um, do you bowl?
Actually I do. Yeah.
This belongs to Cowboy.
- I'm just watching it for him.
- Cowboy bowls?
I don't know what Cowboy does.
All I know is I'm supposed to...
deliver him something
and I'll be on my way.
Well, I would be careful
if I were you.
Three strippers from Vegas were
abducted a couple months ago.
They were last seen getting
in a motor home...
with some guy in
a black duster and cowboy hat.
No one's seen 'em since.
Did you ask Cowboy about it when he
was, uh, you know, in your room?
No. I was scared to death.
He's got these eyes
that, like, hypnotize you.
And then his thing... I don't
wanna get into it, but it's huge!
It's like a rocket ship.
No, I didn't say a word.
Then when I came out of the bathroom,
he left me a thousand dollars.
A thousand dollars?
And I don't even charge
a thousand dollars.
Do you think
he's a serial killer?
A serial killer wouldn't have
left that much money.
Well, I would be careful
if I were you.
Sorry, I don't even
know your name, but...
Oh, I'm John.
John Person.
John Person, the actor?
I thought you looked familiar.
You were on that sitcom...
the one that was canceled about three
years ago with the guy and the girl.
- In the diner. Yeah, that's me.
- I loved that show.
It was only on three times.
I wrote a letter to the network.
It was one of the greatest
shows ever on television.
- Thank you so much.
- This is gonna sound really stupid,
but, um, would you sign
an autograph for me?
- Really?
- Yeah!
You know what? I, uh, I actually have
my head shots. Pick one out here.
I think I'll go with this one.
- Pen?
- Thank you.
Wow. Look at that.
You are so good-looking.
I should get some of these done
instead of my dumb Polaroids.
You have no messages.
Did you fuck her?
Ruthie? No. No.
No, I swear I didn't.
I was supposed to get
together with her tonight.
I was going to ask her to marry me.
Well, that's great, Randy.
Yeah. But then you take her up to
Devil's Crest and get her all fucked up.
No sway, um...
Okay. I see what...
All right.
I met her, we were buying... We
were both separately buying beers.
Look, if I find out that you fucked
her, I swear to God I'll kill you.
Okay, that's not a problem.
It's... It's not an issue.
I don't want you ever
talking to Ruthie again.
'Cause I'll bury you in the desert,
and they won't find your sorry ass.
Okay. This is good.
This is working out...
really well.
Here's Johnny.
You look like hell.
I brought you some room service.
Hey, Randy find you?
He come looking for you late.
Yeah, he found me.
Ahh.
Damn, you're here early. What are
you doing still hanging around here?
You thinkin' about
moving here maybe?
No, Dan.
I'm waiting to deliver a mysterious
suitcase to a hooker-killing cowboy...
who's supposed to
give me $27,000.
On top of that, I've got my neighbor's
head in a bowling ball bag under my sink.
Hmm. You know Elron
over there at the motel?
Did you know that he won the Barstow
to Vegas motorcycle race in '85?
Made him world-famous.
Oh, and then he had the lead the next year,
but his wheel hit javelina hole
and it threw him right off.
Put his head right into
a petrified cactus.
He's got a steel plate
up there now. Yeah.
That's why he mostly works nights.
If Elron worked...
Fuck.
- Come on. You want a ride?
- You didn't tell me about Randy.
- Tell you what?
- What, that he's your boyfriend?
That he might get a little jealous...
and wanna kill me if we went
to Devil's Crest together?
Are you mad at me?
Not mad, it's just Randy stopped by and
offered to kill me if we hung out again.
Don't pay any attention to Randy. He's
crazy. Thinks we're going to get married.
I broke up with him for good this morning.
He tried to hit me and tie me up.
So, I took the truck.
He tried to hit you?
Yeah. Hits me all the time.
Ruthie, you should...
you should never let a man hit you.
Randy's got a bad temper.
I should go, 'cause if he sees us
talking it's just... it's just...
- What are you scared of Randy for?
- I'm not scared of Randy.
Okay? I just don't want
any trouble.
Your mom wasn't too pleased when
I brought you home last night.
Well, Stella likes you.
We were talking about it this morning.
- She said that?
- She says you got a nice face.
Kind eyes and a strong chin.
Things a man can do
with his chin.
Makes me shiver.
What's with the shovel?
You burying bodies out there
in the Big Empty?
Yeah. Body parts. Got the
chain saw out in the bus.
Well, I hope you're
burying them deep enough,
'cause those coyotes
can get pretty persistent.
So that Ruthie,
she's a piece of work, huh?
Yeah, she is.
She's not long
for this place, though.
Next time she runs away,
I'm gonna have to let her go.
You two seem a little more
like sisters to me.
Maybe that's 'cause
she's sort of adopted.
When Ruthie was maybe two years old,
she just wandered up out of the desert.
Little girl lost. They made a big search,
but they never found her real parents.
People around here still think that
she was left behind from up there.
Don't believe 'em, though,
she's just a little girl.
Once Ruthie runs off,
I'm gonna sell this place.
I got a nice little bankroll
stashed away for a rainy day.
Maybe move to Hawaii,
open a little crab shack,
or maybe I'll just lay back on
the white sandy beach all day.
Sounds great.
- You want another?
- No. I'm done.
Welcome sight
for a weary traveler.
What can I get ya?
Tomato juice.
Twist of lime, pinch of pepper.
- Gambler?
- Excuse me?
- What's your game?
- My game?
Don't look like a poker man,
to me.
Couldn't bluff your way out
of a paper bag with that face.
- Uh, let's settle up, Stella.
- I'm guessing slots.
Don't have to think too much. Complete
game of chance, that ol' one-armed bandit.
You just sit down, play slow, let the
house honeys bring you the free drinks.
See you're fond of
the old gin and tonic.
That used to be
one of my favorites.
Honey, bring this man another
gin and tonic. He looks parched.
You know what?
I'm going to be heading out.
Sit down, John.
My name is Banks. Agent Banks of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
And I suggest you take
me up on my little offer.
Not very often you can drink a
gin and tonic on Uncle Sam's tab.
- Well, in that case...
- I'll make it a double?
- So, am I under arrest?
- Break any laws?
I broke no law,
but I know why you're here.
My neighbor Neely was murdered.
Somebody cut off his head.
I noticed this shovel here.
Belongs to the bar.
Forgot to put it away this morning.
- You digging ditches, honey?
- I use it to bury assholes.
I'll just bet you do.
I have a few questions
for you, John.
I found these two files in Neely's
apartment. What can you tell me about 'em?
Never seen 'em before.
The first one contains some
personal information about you.
Financial records.
Details about your career.
And it also contains some things...
more personal, deeper.
Medical records.
Masturbatory techniques.
Preferences.
John, did you provide Neely
with sperm samples?
What do you think?
No.
Then there is this incident involving
Vaseline. Liberally applied to...
- Listen, what do you want from me?
- You ever drive an RV?
- RV?
- Motor home-type deal.
No.
Do you own a black Stetson or a
long, black leather duster?
What is it that you want?
I'm just asking questions, John.
It's our job.
We're the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.
So, you're an actor.
- A thespian.
- A rude mechanical.
- Hmm?
- A rude mechanical.
It's a term that means actor.
Shakespearean.
Boy, that Shakespeare.
He sure could write a play.
You know,
I did a production of...
'The King and I' once
back in high school.
They made me play a slave.
Had to wear a skullcap.
Make me look bald.
Fucking thing itched.
John, this second file...
contains a list of
over 75 people...
that have disappeared without a
trace over the last six years.
I'd like you to have a look at it,
see if you recognize any
of the names on this list.
I mean, nothing looks familiar.
Seventy-five people, John.
Gone. Vanished without a trace.
And they all had families.
I'd like to think I could
provide them with an answer.
Where there loved ones have disappeared to.
I'd like to think you could help me.
Nothing?
Look, I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
Maybe they don't wanna be found. Maybe
they got on a spaceship and flew away.
And there is one other
possibility, John.
They may have all been the victims of,
say, a single, diabolical serial killer.
Maybe somebody who entices his
victims to a remote location...
middle of nowhere,
where he has his way with them.
And then buries their bodies...
somewhere out there,
deep in the desert.
- Wish I could help you.
- I wish you could too, John.
Grace tell you where to find me?
No, you're pretty little
neighbor covered for you.
That's a brave girl you got there, John.
Lying to the FBI.
You oughta keep her.
Here's my card.
If you should happen to remember
anything... anything at all...
please give me a call.
Or, if you'd like to
research a role,
I've worked with
a couple of big actors in town.
- Fact is, I even wrote a screenplay.
- Really?
Yeah. Well, it's the story of
a mediocre guy, really.
Ordinary in just about every way.
Suddenly he finds himself on the lam.
Alone. You see, he's running away
from himself and from the law...
because of a crime that he may
or may not have committed.
- You'd be perfect for it.
- Thank you.
Send me your head shot.
Oh, John.
One more thing.
Neely was last seen with a blue
suitcase and a bowling ball bag.
You have no clue as to the
whereabouts of those two bags?
No. Sorry.
So you wouldn't mind if I took a
quick look around your motel room?
It's all right, John.
I already searched it.
Your friend Elron was only
too happy to let me in.
Lucky for you all I could find
was some Bun Boy wrappers...
and a half-empty bottle
of hand lotion.
Must be the climate.
Listen, asshole, you couldn't
bluff your way out of a paper bag.
I don't like being lied to.
When I figure out what you're up to,
I'm going to take you down, motherfucker!
Do not fuck with the FBI!
Had you there, didn't I?
Just a line
out of my screenplay.
I could of been an actor.
Slave, my ass!
I should have been the king.
- Why would you let Randy in?
- Why not? He's a friend of yours.
- He's not a friend of mine.
- Well, you said he was.
And then that FBI guy came, and he had
a badge. I had to let him in Johnny-O.
And you're not my friend either,
so stop calling me Johnny-O or John-Boy.
It's John Person.
Check the goddamn register!
You really do have a
steel plate in your head.
Who told you that?
Dan?
- I hit a javelina hole.
- Now, where's Randy live?
At the junkyard.
The junkyard.
Drop it!
I've got nothing,
and you wanna take it all away.
I told you,
stay away from Ruthie.
I saw you talking to her this
morning in my fucking truck!
Hey, she pulled over,
she said hi. I said hi.
- What's in the suitcase?
- Nothing.
- What the hell are you doing?
- She broke up with me.
So you tied her up?
Did you hit her?
Just you and me now, dude.
Don't be an idiot.
I got a gun. I'll shoot you!
Then shoot me, asshole.
I don't care.
Exactly. I'm gonna carve you
like Thanksgiving dinner.
- I'll do it!
- You won't!
I will! Now,
put down the fucking chain saw!
- We're gonna get married.
- You can't marry a dead girl, Randy.
Now drop it!
- You don't have to yell.
- I said drop it!
You don't have to
go all psycho on me, dude.
Now, get the suitcase
and put it in the bus.
What's so special about
this suitcase?
I don't know!
Just put it on the fucking bus!
- Are you all right, baby?
- You were gonna shoot me!
I wasn't gonna shoot you.
I wasn't gonna...
You cocked the goddamn trigger!
There's no bullets in
the fucking gun, okay?
Don't say a goddamn word, Randy.
This is not how
you treat a woman.
You don't kidnap a woman.
You don't tie her to a chair.
You don't put a gag
in a woman's mouth.
- And you never, ever hit a woman, Randy.
- I never hit her.
You stay away from Ruthie, okay?
She's got plans.
She deserves respect.
She deserves to be treated like a woman.
You think she likes to be trapped
in the middle of goddamn nowhere...
with some loser
who ties her up and beats her?
You think about
your life, Randy.
You think it through.
You make some-some plans.
You develop some hopes and
realistic dreams for your future.
And then you act
upon them, Randy.
- Look. Hey.
- Don't do it. Don't say a fucking word.
I came here to do a simple job...
to deliver a blue suitcase.
And as soon as that job is done,
you will never see me again, Randy.
I'll be gone from your life.
And I can promise you one thing.
I am not leaving that goddamn
motel room, until this job is done.
Don't even ask.
It's all right, Mom.
He rescued me.
It wasn't him that tied me up.
It was Randy.
Randy did this to you?
- Bring her inside.
- Mom?
Now!
You have no messages.
Hi, it's Grace.
Please leave a message.
Hey, Grace. It's John. I'm really sorry
it's so late. I'm still in the desert.
Now listen, I-I met
Agent Banks today.
He found out where I was. I just
wanted to tell you everything was okay.
I cleared my name, okay?
I didn't want you to worry.
And I really want to thank you
for not telling him where I was.
Good-bye, Grace.
Go away, Ruthie.
Just thought you might want a cold pop.
Gets awful lonely out here.
Please. I don't want any trouble.
Randy'll kill us both.
Fuck Randy.
He's a loser.
Hey, I just wanted to thank you
for what you said this afternoon...
about me being a woman
who deserves respect.
You need to get away
from that maniac.
The thing to do is just get a one-way
ticket out of here, hit the highway.
Where is Randy?
Lieutenant Gates went by the
junkyard and arrested him.
- So he's in jail?
- Wherever.
I hope he's gone
for good this time.
Hey, uh...
I got you a present.
I did just like you said.
I gave it some love.
It's beautiful.
No one's ever given me
a flower before.
But, I just wanted you
to have it, you know?
Being that you're
going away and all.
I don't know. I just wanted you
to have something...
to, uh, remember me by.
Come on.
Live a little.
Twenty-seven thousand?
What are you gonna do
with all that?
I'm gonna pay off
my credit card debts.
But with all that money?
I mean, we could just...
We could steal Randy's truck
and just drive.
- Where are we gonna drive?
- Anywhere but here.
We could just disappear. Just... I
don't know. We could drive to Hawaii.
All those palm trees and white sandy
beaches and cool ocean breezes.
We could just fly away into that
big, blue sky that goes on forever.
What do you wanna do?
We could do anything.
- Ruthie, listen...
- Come on.
Ruthie, listen to what you're saying.
Twenty-seven thousand
dollars is not a lot of money.
It's enough.
Enough for what?
To-To steal Randy's truck...
and drive to-to Hawaii
and live happily ever after?
You're not very optimistic.
I am.
I'm very optimistic.
I started off good. You know, I had
nothing, but I had a dream and a purpose.
You know, then suddenly
I'm lost...
and I'm out of money and lonely.
You know? And I did nothing wrong. I
mean, I swear to God, I did nothing wrong.
I just wanna get back
to where I started.
You started with nothing,
and that's what you wanna get back to?
- And what about me?
- You?
Here's what you
need to do, Ruthie.
You need to forget about me and
you gotta forget about Randy.
And it's time for you to leave this
town, okay? You gotta see the world.
You gotta just go
and not look back.
I should probably go.
You know, you're a good man.
I can tell.
Good things are gonna happen for you.
Thank you.
There'll be the last words
you ever speak, movie star.
We're goin' for a ride.
Randy...
What are you worried about?
You're a good man.
Good things are
gonna happen for you.
Randy, let's talk
about this for a minute.
- Shut up!
- Ow! Goddamn it, Randy!
Get that suitcase
and put it in the truck bed!
You want to hear a sad story?
Keep fuckin' digging, dude.
When I was a little boy,
I lived up in Vegas.
My daddy worked security
at the Sands.
Then when he'd get off
late at night,
he'd go out partying with
the pretty little showgirls.
Then he'd come home
all fuckin' drunk,
and he'd beat my mama.
So one night...
I'm 10 years old...
and I'm waiting for him,
and I'm hidden,
and I got his
10-inch hunting knife.
And that night,
first time he hits my mama I bury
that motherfucking blade in his back.
Twenty, maybe 30 times.
And my mama, she's screaming.
She's trying to pull me
off him, but she can't,
because I wouldn't let
that fucker touch us again.
And I remember
the look in her eyes.
I miss you, Mama!
Get up.
She looked into my eyes,
and I knew she don't see
her little boy anymore.
She only sees
the eyes of a killer.
Randy, please don't do this.
- Turn around, dude.
- Please.
I said, turn around.
What I learned...
is that you never take away...
the thing that
somebody else loves.
Real sad story, Randy.
- Who are you?
- Call me Cowboy, dude.
Where did you come from?
Your mama sent me.
She asked me to give you this.
Top of the evening to you, John.
- Cowboy?
- Let's go, partner.
But... He'll be taken care of.
Bring the suitcase
and the shovel.
Boy, that Randy sure could talk.
Look, I appreciate you
saving my life and all,
but... where did you
come from?
Born out of a devil's
wedlock, partner.
Right.
You mean, how did I get out here
in the middle of goddamn nowhere...
just in time to save
your sorry ass?
Yeah.
That's a mystery, ain't it?
- What's with the cowboy getup?
- What, you don't like it?
You got my money?
You'll get your money,
buckaroo... 27,000 and change.
But this night's not over yet.
There's been a little hitch in the giddyup.
What? You got your suitcase.
I'll explain when we
get back to the motel.
Hey, got a little surprise
waiting for you there.
Now, listen to me.
You will not leave this room.
We need you to watch these blue
suitcases till just after midnight.
Then you load them
into Randy's truck.
Courier them to a dry lake bed
about halfway up Devil's Highway.
Turn when you see the Indian.
- His name is Bob.
- Bob the Indian.
Yeah.
He'll be waitin'.
He'll ride in the back,
guide you the rest of the way.
Okay, you know what?
I'm done. Okay?
Neely said bring up the
suitcase, deliver it to you.
A deal's a deal.
I want my money.
Yeah, well, Neely fucked up.
What did you do with his head?
Where's the bowling ball bag?
It's buried out back.
Then dig it up.
I need it.
You know what? I'm not doing this.
I'm through, all right?
Go ahead. You can shoot me if
you fucking want, but I'm done.
You ain't got
no choice, partner.
No choice?
I don't have a choice?
Everybody's got a choice.
I told you I had a little surprise waiting.
Yeah, well, I want my money.
I'm leaving.
- A deal's a deal.
- Open your mouth and close your eyes,
and I'm gonna give you
a big surprise.
Fuck you, asshole.
I got a surprise waiting for you out here.
Since you're such
a stick in the mud,
I figured I'd better bring
along a little extra insurance.
I'm sorry, Grace. I don't know what's going
on here. I don't know what's happening.
- Hand me the gun, John.
- I'm sorry, John.
He said you were in trouble,
and that I'd be able to help.
- Wasn't part of the deal.
- The gun, John.
Don't worry.
Now, here's the deal, John.
You do exactly as I say.
You go dig up the bowling ball
bag, and you bring it to me.
Then you'll deliver
the blue suitcases...
exactly as I asked you.
You do that simple job,
and your girlfriend Gracie here...
will live a long
and fruitful life.
Whoa. Where's Grace?
She'll be fine.
You do your job, I'll do mine.
Now, this will need
to go with the suitcases.
Promise me if I deliver
these suitcases...
that you'll leave
Grace out of this.
I'm a man of my word, John.
Why me?
I help people move on, John.
Help 'em to escape their
mundane, ordinary lives.
If you want to keep living
this life of quiet desperation,
that's up to you.
Hey, John-John.
- Ain't that Randy's truck?
- He, uh... I borrowed it.
I gotta make a delivery.
Tonight's the night.
Tonight's the night they come.
It's a freak show.
I wouldn't go too deep in the desert if
I were you. You might never come back.
In fact, maybe you'd better stay
here with us till it's over.
Sorry, I... I gotta do this.
But it's been
real fun meeting you.
Well, if, uh,
you change your mind,
we'll be in there.
But knock first.
You Bob the Indian?
No, I'm Lawrence
of fucking Arabia.
Nice guess, kemo sabe.
You want to get in, Bob?
No, no.
I'll ride up top.
You... go that way.
Pull over by the cone there.
Whoa. Good.
Now, you unload these suitcases,
and you arrange 'em
in a big circle...
exactly 12 paces
from each other.
I think that might be
your job, Bob.
Well, I think your girlfriend
Grace's life depends on it.
Just... do it.
Do it.
Jesus Christ.
What do you want me
to do with this?
Head to the center.
Then what?
Stand there...
and wait.
Wait for what?
What's happening here, Bob?
It's the same old same old.
Am I gonna die?
We all die, John Person.
It's just a matter of when.
It's the way of the world.
You finally ask yourself,
'Was my life worth living?'
'Did I make the right decisions?'
'Did I do the right thing?'
'Will I be remembered?'
It's a tough old road
we follow, isn't it?
Myself...
there's a lot of things I want to
accomplish before I leave this earth.
Yeah. Me too, Bob.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna get goin'.
- You take me with ya?
- Don't even ask.
You know how he gets.
Bob, don't leave me out here.
I'm gonna go back to bed.
It's too late for this spooky shit.
It gets old.
Bob!
Hey, Bob, don't leave me here.
Look! It comes!
Ruthie!
What are you doing?
She's been instructed
not to speak with you.
What's going on?
Done a fine job here, John.
Yeah, where's Grace?
Patience, my friend.
Patience?
What are you all doing?
Are all you people crazy?
What's happening here?
- It's time, John.
- Time for what?
Time to go.
It's the chance
of a lifetime, John,
but you only get one chance.
Put these on,
and you're on your way.
On my way where?
To paradise, my friend.
There's no such place.
Oh, yes, John.
There is.
Make a choice.
There's a whole
other world out there.
One chance, John.
Make it count.
You goin' too?
My ticket is open-ended.
And my work here is never done.
Where's Grace?
It's time to go, partner.
Are you okay, Ruthie?
What's going on here?
Go with me.
Go with you where?
Out there.
Maybe it's a better place.
Ruthie, I'm not going anywhere.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Are you?
I am.
Thank you, John.
Thanks for your help, John.
A deal's a deal.
Let's start a new game, John.
What are you?
I'm just a cowboy, John,
pure and simple.
John?
- Grace.
- John.
I thought you were dead.
That cowboy threatened me.
He threatened me, and he made me stay
in that awful motel for three days.
He killed Randy,
and-and he took Ruthie away.
And all those people in the... in the
blue track suits, they're all gone.
Just calm down.
It's all right.
You don't know what you're saying.
You've been out here for three days.
John, let's go home.
- Get you some rest.
- Three days?
John, why are you still
carrying that suitcase?
It's locked.
I can't open it.
Cowboy gave me this.
He said you'd know what to do.
- Case closed?
- Orders from above.
Seems this one really
tickled a few funny bones.
- Didn't you go back to Baker?
- We did. Came up empty.
- But it happened.
- John, I got the file right here.
It contains your whole story...
Neely, Cowboy, the blue suitcase,
the alleged murders,
the alleged incident in the desert.
But they were there. There were
15 people getting on a damn RV.
John, do you really expect me to
believe you were abducted by aliens...
wearing track suits?
Says here in your statement,
you believe they
have stolen your sperm.
I don't know.
It's what Dan said,
that Elron says.
It's the only thing
that made sense.
We checked out every
detail of your story.
John, I would like to
thank you personally...
for coming in here on your own.
It was very courageous of you,
but we've done everything we can.
But Ruthie... she's gone!
Yes, she is. We spoke
to Stella about that.
She's convinced that she and
Randy ran off together somewhere.
And we asked around, but Ruthie's gonna
be of legal age in a couple of weeks,
so it's a dead issue.
- Of legal age?
- Oh!
We did find Neely's head...
in a Dumpster outside a
bowling alley in Reno.
Coyotes had been at it. You can imagine.
The man was ugly to begin with.
- What about the money?
- We looked into your accounts.
It seems that last week you
did pay off a sizable debt.
Lucky for you.
Credit cards can be a nasty business.
Lucky for me mine's
a government card.
But the money didn't
just appear.
Baker's pretty close to the state line
or Vegas. A few hands of blackjack.
Couple of quarters in the slots. Who knows?
Those jackpots can really build up.
So you think I won the money?
A lot of fortunes have been
won and lost out there...
in the middle of the
desert, John.
Now it's just a matter
for the IRS.
- The IRS?
- And this Cowboy fella.
That's quite a mystery,
the way you describe it.
We'll be sure to keep
an eye out for him.
- So the IRS is...
- Just another government agency...
with a job to do, John.
It's not my department.
I wouldn't worry about it, though.
Oh, and John, we're not gonna tell
you that we don't believe you.
Maybe we do,
maybe we don't.
And there is still the matter of
those 75-plus missing people...
- we've been charged to investigate.
- But...
But, when people like
yourself and others...
come to us with tales
of blue suitcases,
cowboys and aliens,
well, let's just say...
that's not the kind of story...
the government wants to tell
the families of missing people.
Listen to me.
I'm not fucking crazy.
I'm telling you what happened.
It's the goddamn truth!
Now. something strange is going on out
there, and people's lives are at stake!
John, that was incredible.
You know I didn't make this up.
Didn't say you did.
Didn't say you didn't.
But you're an actor, and from what
I've just seen, a damn good one.
Why you're not a big star
beats the hell out of me.
If I were you, I'd forget
about this whole sordid story.
Send me that head shot.
Yes!
Did you see that?
Yeah, two strikes
in a row. Finally.
I told you they'd call.
I knew it would happen.
Wasn't exactly what
I was hoping for, but...
John, you'll be great.
You can't be the lead
every time.
A supporting role is... good.
Thank you, Grace.
You look different tonight.
It's the tenth frame.
You get one more chance.
Make it count.
Then we start a new game.
