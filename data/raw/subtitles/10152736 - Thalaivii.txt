-Come quickly!
-Come on. Let's go!
Get the camera ready!
-Ma'am, what is your next plan of action?
-They've jailed your MLAs overnight.
If MJR were alive, would he…
How are you going to prove
the innocence of your party?
Respected Speaker.
I shall now present before you
the budget for the coming financial year.
Don't read it!
Respected Speaker…
please listen to my argument as well.
Before presenting the budget,
the Chief Minister will
have to answer my questions.
Why have you imprisoned my MLAs?
False cases of corruption
have been slapped on us.
Our phones have been tapped.
Are you the Chief Minister or a despot?
Right here, right now,
you must tender your resignation.
Calm down!
The government is only doing its duty.
The Opposition is answerable
for their evil deeds during their regime.
Our evil deeds?!
Sir, what is he trying to say?
You are pointing a finger
at MJR and his government!
The man who spent his entire
life in the service of people.
Who are you to sling mud at him?
-Who are you to speak on behalf of MJR?
-Gopal--
Are you MJR's wife?
Or his daughter?
Or a relative?
Are you his political successor?
Who the heck are you?
You have to tell us the truth today!
What was your relationship with MJR?
It must have some name.
Even MJR did not acknowledge
this nameless relationship,
then tell us,
what do you expect from the public?
Hey! Mind your manners!
You are just blabbering now!
Hey, be quiet.
You're talking about my manners?!
Just because you all stand
behind her and scream "Thalaivii,"
that doesn't mean she's
a great leader, or she can replace MJR!
Hey, shut up!
How dare you say that!
Hey, please calm down.
Let go of me!
All this has happened because of her!
All this has happened because of you!
You and your men humiliated me today…
in front of everyone in the Assembly…
the same way Draupadi was humiliated
by the Kauravas when they
tried to disrobe her.
She had won that power struggle.
And I shall win this power struggle.
Because the other name
for the Mahabharata is…
Jaya.
I take a vow today…
that I shall return to this
Assembly only as the Chief Minister.
Start camera! Sound!
Ready! One! Two!
-Mr. MJR is here.
-He is here.
-Sir is here.
-Leave all that aside, and let's go.
Who is that?
Hey, look!
She is standing so close to MJR!
She is going to ruin his life, I'm sure!
Ma'am, you seem to be getting
too close to MJR nowadays.
Look. You can talk to him
at the shooting or on the set.
There, you can even hug him or touch him.
No problem.
But you can't do that…
in front of the public…
because for them, MJR is not a hero.
He is God.
And we pray to God only from afar, right?
So, the distance between you two
should be a minimum of six inches.
Keep that in mind.
I only get paid for my acting on the set.
Not off the set.
Off the set,
I won't pay heed to what you say.
And don't forget that
we're not done shooting the film yet.
-Murugan, let's go.
-Yes, ma'am.
What's the matter?
We don't have a shoot today.
Then why did you call me?
Murthy.
Yes, sir.
Hey, I am asking you.
Why did you call me here?
Come inside. Quick.
Yeah, put it down here.
Go on.
Did you collect all the reels?
Hope you didn't forget anything.
No, sir.
Whether you're done shooting the film…
or not…
I don't care.
I only care about MJR's reputation.
Nothing is more important
to me than his reputation.
Neither the heroine nor her mother.
Now we're done.
Sir, Sandhya has
a beautiful 16-year-old daughter.
She is good at acting.
She will be a good choice for our film.
Even Mr. Banthul feels the same way.
How can I be paired
opposite such a young girl?
What's the problem with that?
My dear husband.
If you work with young girls,
you will look more youthful.
Tell Mr. Banthul that he has said yes.
Okay, sir.
Ammu, you are very lucky.
You got a chance to work
with MJR for your first film itself.
He is not just a hero.
He is God in the eyes of the public.
Even if you get to do one scene with him,
you will be set for life.
-Sir is here!
-Sir is here!
-Namaste, sir.
-Namaste, sir.
Namaste, sir.
Ammu, get up.
Get up.
Come on, get up.
Ammu, what do you think of yourself?
Because of you, RNV schooled me!
Your career will finish
before it even takes off.
Ammu! Ammu, listen to me!
Ammu… respecting others won't
make you any less of a person.
Respect should come from within!
Keep a cool head and think about it, Ammu.
If you would have just stood up
from your chair, it wouldn't have--
Am I a doorman to keep
standing up for everyone?
I left my studies midway to act
only in films, not in real life!
Didn't I do that for you?
What else am I supposed to do?
Yes, of course.
You're doing everything just for me.
When you become a famous heroine,
only your name will appear
on the posters, not mine.
Ammu!
How immature!
If you want to sustain yourself in this
industry, you have to learn the ways here.
-Listen--
-Got it?
Ma'am, she is just a kid. Let her be.
Please.
Yeah, take her side! Carry on!
Amma.
Fluffy.
I will greet him in such a way tomorrow…
Sir is here!
-Namaste, sir.
-Hey--
Namaste.
-Hello, sir.
-Namaste. God bless you.
Namaste, sir.
Wait a minute.
Namaste.
Namaste, boss.
Namaste.
-Namaste.
-Namaste.
-Namaste.
-Namaste.
Namaste. Namaste, brother.
Namaste.
Namaste.
-What is she doing?
-Namaste.
-Namaste--
-Ammu, get up. What are you doing?
-Have you gone mad?
-Why? What's wrong?
If those with two legs
get so much respect,
then those with four legs
should get more respect, right?
Don't look down upon him.
He does his work after
the shooting is done.
He safeguards the entire set.
So… he also deserves respect, right?
She is so childish.
-Madhavan.
-Yes?
I did the right thing, didn't I?
Yes, ma'am.
You did the right thing.
But what your mom did…
was wrong.
She was leading the life of a queen.
She was so happy.
Then she lost her husband.
For the sake of her child's
upbringing and education,
she left Mysore
and got settled in Madras.
That was wrong.
To keep her child's life colorful,
she didn't care about her colorless life.
And then she made the biggest mistake.
Well, every parent makes this mistake.
The mistake of having
expectations from their children.
Thinking that their children
will be there for them.
That was also wrong.
In fact, your mom is always wrong.
You are absolutely right though.
What happened, Madhavan?
I am sorry, Mom.
I am sorry.
Rolling!
Action!
Sir.
Hey, come here quickly.
Sir, please continue the scene with
another artist. We'll take care of him.
I can always work with another artist…
but when will this man get
a chance to work with me again?
Brother… don't worry.
Only when you get well
and come back will we shoot this scene.
Take him.
Veerappan!
Take him to the hospital in my car.
Slowly. Be careful.
Inform his family members.
Veerappan will take care
of all his hospital expenses.
Yes, sir.
Good.
You voluntarily stood
up to show him respect.
I had said that respect
should come from within.
Today, it came from within.
For a good human being.
Are you feeling shy?
Are you still feeling shy?
Cut!
What are you doing?
Your acting should look real.
-Saraswati, please make her understand.
-Okay, master.
Come here.
-Ready, master!
-I hope she got it now.
Yes, she did.
Sir, let's do it one more time.
Sorry, sir.
Take, sir.
Sound!
Ready. One, two…
Hey! Cut!
What are you doing?
Whatever you're doing,
please do it with emotions.
-Explain it to her again.
-Yes, I will.
Didn't I just tell you how to do it?
Keep your hand on his shoulder gracefully.
And then you have to hug him.
Ready, sir?
-Ready?
-Master!
Let us shoot this after a break.
Is the step difficult or…
is it something else?
Do you get scared when
you hug your mother?
No.
What does your mother call you?
Ammu.
Have it.
Ammu.
Imagine that I am your mother…
and hug me.
Are you feeling shy?
Are you still feeling shy?
Your eyes are mystifying
What are they implying?
Are you feeling shy?
I am…
Oh, a song?
-Why don't you sing it?
-A song?
Me?
I can't sing.
That's a lie.
What's there in your eyes?
There are dreams in my eyes.
Sing it.
Or else, I'm leaving.
Hey!
What's there in your eyes?
There are dreams in my eyes
Who comes into your dreams?
Someone who belongs to me
Who is it? Is it me?
No, sir
It's not you
Who wouldn't want to act with Mr. Shivaji!
But the dates…
We need the dates in March, ma'am.
In March, probably--
Ma'am, after the 10th March,
we can give them a week.
What about the AVM film?
It starts only after the 28th.
Do think a little about me
There are many like you
-Cut!
-But that moment never seems to arrive
Why do you do this to me?
Let it be, sir.
It's just a matter of one film.
This had to happen
I just have to find a place in my heart
Sir, if we had signed Jaya for our film,
the film would have been completed early.
Shut your mouth.
I do what I desire, it is me
I am brave at heart, this is me
That's why I ran away.
Raju.
Shall I wear it?
You look good.
The shot is ready, sir.
Ma'am, the shot is ready.
Okay.
I'm not giving it back.
There should be only one chair on the set.
MJR's chair.
I do what I desire, it is me
I am brave at heart, this is me
Cut!
Superb, sir! Superb!
Wonderful! Amazing!
I really enjoyed it.
It was great.
-Hey--
-Ammu!
Where does it hurt? Here?
Here.
Give me some water.
I thought about you, and you came
May you live long
I asked you, and you gave me
Your beautiful heart
Cut!
Superb, sir! It was a great shot!
Sir, can I get a still, please?
Can I ask you something?
Yes.
When you hug me, whom do you think of?
Sathanandavathi.
She is Mrs. Sathanandavathi…
Mr. MJR's first wife.
He was deeply in love with her.
She is no more.
Be mine if I say yes
Without you…
Amuda!
Amuda!
Amuda!
Tell me, can I step into your heart?
My heart is your home
Stay as you like
Please come and take me in your arms
But first, tell me it was me
Yes, it was indeed you
Sir.
You have a dialogue here.
Your dialogue is, "Amuda,
I need to tell you something important."
Shall we do the shot after lunch?
Raju.
Namaste, sir.
What are you trying to do?
Sathanandavathi is not
a character from one of my films.
She is a part of my life.
She will always be.
I know,
but…
I want to become the person that you like.
I want to talk
about the things that you like.
When you smile, I laugh.
When you don't talk
to me, I feel suffocated.
I am sorry.
Ammu.
I used to call her Ammu too.
-They said, "Come back next week."
-That's good.
Your calendar seems to be
even busier than you are.
It just keeps us waiting.
Why aren't you giving us the dates?
I have back-to-back shoots.
So, it seems difficult.
We'll see.
We're facing a huge loss.
Please give us the dates.
I will talk to Veerappan.
Sir, please write one
check for the staff.
Thank you, sir.
-Sir.
-Sir.
Sir, I am getting constant calls
from Mr. Shivaji's manager.
He wants to sign Jaya for his next film.
I told him that I'd ask you and get back.
What should I tell him?
My next four films' producers
have already booked Jaya.
It seems difficult.
Convey the same.
No. Don't worry.
The meeting will be over in half an hour.
-Please be seated. I'll be right back.
-Okay.
-Is he in?
-Yes, sir.
Get some tea quickly.
Do you know who has come to Madras?
Who? Pataudi?
Are you going to see him?
What do you mean?
Are you not coming with me?
Me?
I will get it.
What do you want?
I need to talk to sir.
It's urgent.
We are discussing something more
important than your urgent matter.
-Who was it?
-No one.
You'll come with me, right?
You know I have absolutely
no interest in cricket.
What will I do there?
I want to see both my heroes together.
But how can I watch my
heroine admiring another hero?
Be careful.
I've heard that girls swoon over Pataudi.
Is it so easy to swoon Jaya?
-He's coming.
-How long do we have to wait?
Only five minutes.
Stop.
Producers have been waiting here.
What important discussion was going on?
Medu vada.
MJR was saying that the less
someone meddles with a medu vada,
the better it turns out to be.
Sir, namaste.
Open the gate.
Oh, God! What just happened? Get up!
Please say something!
-No…
-Sir.
Deepan! Call the ambulance!
Keep your eyes open. Doctor…
Namaste, ma'am. Please come.
Wait here. The doctor's checking him.
Brother.
He was saved by the grace of God.
This doctor and his
knowledge have saved him.
Knowledge is God.
Doctor, thank you so much.
You saved my husband's life.
It's my duty.
In fact, it's an honor for me.
What is it?
Just a minute.
Take it.
HOW CAN I CAMPAIGN IN THIS CONDITION?
You don't need to campaign.
You don't even need to say a single word.
Just contest the election.
That would be sufficient for us to win.
I am not saying this.
Anna has sent this message.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
Veerappan.
In this election,
-we should pay more attention to--
-Thank God, you are okay.
You are…
you are Jaya, right?
Yes.
You are the talk of the town these days.
You are doing well.
But…
how come you are here?
This is not a film shoot, right?
-Hello?
-Ammu.
I saw you.
Why did you go from there?
Are you upset?
We'll meet soon.
Let's meet right now.
How can we meet right now, Ammu?
Uncle.
-Please get some rest.
-Yes.
We'll meet soon, Ammu.
Hello?
In the recent election,
Anna's party has emerged victorious,
and it has formed the government.
Seventeen years of Congress regime
has come to an end today.
For the first time in Indian politics,
a regional party is forming
a government with a complete majority.
Ramachandra.
TAMIZHAGA MAKKAL KAZHAGAM
Life goes on well when
it is properly balanced.
Doctors have advised you to get
rest, and you are campaigning.
Stop worrying about me, Ammu.
I can never stop worrying about you.
Karuna and I have always
shared the same philosophy.
"Think good for your people.
Do good things.
And it'll always benefit you in return."
You and your politics!
I find politics very bad.
-So do I.
-Then why are you in politics?
We don't want white clothes
or cars with flashing lights.
We just want to become
the voice of the people.
So that their voices are heard.
This state is in the need
of revolutionaries, not politicians.
And there is no bigger
revolutionary than Karuna.
We have come to power
for the first time in the state.
We won't let people's dreams be shattered.
Politics gives us so many things.
Money, power, position, recognition.
But it takes away a lot too.
And in this give-and-take,
man moves very far away.
Sometimes, from himself
and sometimes, from his own people.
You know so much about politics.
Come and join us.
I'm asking you to get rest,
and you are busy trying to ruin my peace.
God, save me from this politics.
How can we just give you the story? Now--
-Namaste, sir.
-Namaste.
Namaste.
Ammu, he is the producer
of our next film.
Okay.
I'll go and get ready.
-Please wait for a while.
-Sure, sir.
-The interview is over.
-But sir, I…
Sir.
Man can never experience
truth and joy together in life.
MJR's joy lies in Jaya.
But the truth is that if Jaya
continues to associate with him,
his political career will be done for.
Truth has to lose to joy.
What are you doing here?
There is an important discussion going on.
Let it conclude. Wait outside.
But--
-What happened? What did he say?
-You and MJR together will be a hit.
Yes.
Hey, come on! Let's go!
Murthy!
Who was that girl?
What is this?
Your full and final settlement.
Your role is over.
The film is not even half done.
And what about my intro song, for which
I have been rehearsing for a month?
The thing is, your character
in this film is going to die.
If a dead girl starts singing,
it'll look strange, won't it?
How is she going to die?
She wasn't going to die until yesterday.
You changed the story today?!
It's my story.
My money.
And my wish.
So, I'll have to decide whom
I want dead and when, right?
Do one thing.
Go home.
Go home and make medu vada.
Go. Pack up.
Sir, I spoke to the party
members many times.
-Why didn't you tell me?
-They were not ready to listen.
What does it matter
if I was in the shoot?
But what does that--
RNV removed me from the film.
Ammu, it's just one film.
It's okay. You'll get another film.
Why are you getting upset?
He removed me from the film. Without
my knowledge, he cast another actress.
And I can't even get upset?!
I cannot discuss this now.
There are party people around.
Try to understand. Go home.
We will discuss this later.
Let's go.
So, I was saying that please let me
know when something like this happens.
This guy is hell-bent
on ruining your career.
What should we do now?
Let's make medu vada.
But in Jaya's style.
Call the press.
Mr. Shivaji is like a medu vada.
A little salty, a little spicy,
a little soft, and a little hot.
All the other heroes are
like idli before him.
Uninspiring and plain.
If a hero can reach within ten feet
of him, it's a big achievement.
This is great news, ma'am.
Thank you.
Why is she praising
Mr. Shivaji all of a sudden?
This is front-page news.
That's true.
Ma'am.
You've made your statement,
but I wonder what Mr. MJR would feel.
Forget that.
Think about what Mr. Shivaji would feel.
I'm sure he'll call up his manager.
After that, just wait and watch.
Ma'am, I have a doubt.
Who is the better actor of the two?
It is difficult to say who is better.
But shall I tell you…
who the best actor is?
I am.
It is not a joke to get
to work with Mr. Shivaji.
He is such a huge star,
and I am so inexperienced.
Just give us your dates.
He will take care of the rest, ma'am.
To work with Mr. Shivaji, I'll have
to focus exclusively on his film.
I'll have to forgo two other films.
I am only worried about that.
Ma'am, don't worry about it.
You can decide your signing amount.
Whatever you think is fit.
Goodbye.
Didn't I tell you?
I am the best actor.
But Ammu…
Mom…
I am going to work with Mr. Shivaji.
When my posters
with Mr. Shivaji are all over the city,
RNV will understand whom he messed with.
The place you have come to
Is a good one
Welcome, my queen
From now on, you must be showered
With sweet pleasures of love
Why didn't you tell me before leaving?
I don't think I have
a place in that house.
How was I supposed to tell you?
What are you saying, Malathi?
Only a woman can
understand another woman.
What is this, sir? What did you do?
Whose idea was it
to kill Jaya's character?
That person murdered the entire film.
All the theaters are empty, sir.
Give it a thought, sir.
Yours was a hit pair.
Now she will appear on
the screen with every other actor.
We've incurred a great loss, sir.
Why isn't your fever going down?
Mom.
Is MJR here?
Really?
Look at him.
No matter how distant his people are…
he always remembers them.
He remembers them…
only when there is a necessity.
If there is no necessity,
people don't even remember God.
Whatever MJR says now…
please don't object to it.
Why shouldn't I?
He loves you a lot.
He cares about you a lot.
Remember. If he acts entitled…
don't hurt him.
Even if that hurts me?
Dear, speak to touch his heart…
not to wound it.
Ammu.
I am just an actor.
I'm obliged to listen to the producer.
And the public as well.
But when I heard the voice
inside me, I couldn't ignore it.
That's why I am here.
I have made a decision.
My next film will be with you.
Great.
Everyone except me is making
decisions about my career.
Ammu.
At least, hear the story once.
What's the point? What you narrate
will never see the light of day.
There are two heroines in the film.
That has become a custom now!
Mom asks me to stay quiet,
but I am inured to speak out.
There are two heroines…
but you will play them both.
Double role?!
Sir.
There is a parcel for you.
MY LOVING GIFT TO YOU
-JAYA
You tried to kill her once,
and she bounced back with two lives.
She is indestructible now.
Madhavan,
the parking space is good, right?
Yes, it's very good.
Ma'am.
It's a beautiful house.
It will only add to your dignity.
-When shall we get the registration done?
-It's your house now.
-You can get it done whenever you want.
-Okay, thank you.
You did a nice thing.
You are bringing back your mother's joy.
But that's my responsibility.
You have worked very hard.
Now you should think about your future.
Every newspaper has been
publishing only one thing.
"Does Jaya love MJR?"
Who doesn't love MJR?
Lord Krishna was just like that.
He used to reside in everyone's heart.
But Radha was not just one of many.
Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister,
Mr. Annadurai,
breathed his last today
in Madras due to illness.
His body has been kept in
Rajaji Hall for a final glimpse.
Following Anna's demise,
the PWD Minister, Mr. M. Karunanidhi,
has been elected as
the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.
My dear brothers and sisters.
Our state is in safe hands.
We will not be able to find
a better leader than my friend, Karuna.
And we shall follow
the principles of Anna and Periyar.
This is our promise.
Thank you.
Now our Honorable Chief Minister
will say a few words.
I don't know…
whether I deserve your
love and trust or not.
But I will definitely make
an effort not to let down…
my friend's trust in me.
If I am here today,
it is because of MJR.
That's why,
I would like to read
a poem in his honor.
"He is no God,
but he is no less than God.
My dear friend, MJR."
Sir, it's time for the shoot.
-Right now?
-Yes, sir.
But Karuna's speech--
It's quite late, sir.
We are getting constant calls.
"My dear friend, MJR.
He taught us to win…
-Inform them that I had to leave.
-but he never disowned those who lost.
That is the kind of man
my dear friend, MJR, is.
We shall keep your name eternal.
There will be no one else…"
Thank you.
What happened at the rally is different
than what the newspapers
are trying to portray.
What did you see?
Didn't you see it?
The whole crowd was there to see you.
Very cleverly they
removed you from the frame,
and only printed Karuna's picture.
Let it be, Ammu. It must be a mistake.
Mistakes don't happen at such high levels.
Only conspiracies happen.
I feel Karuna wants to become not only
the leader of the public but also God.
Ammu, this is not a film poster.
This is politics.
And Karuna is the hero.
If Karuna is the hero, then who are you?
-Sir.
-We have a party meeting today, right?
What are you all doing here?
Sir, they're saying that…
if you have a shooting, then you will
leave the meeting halfway through.
Mr. Karuna has said that you
should complete the shooting.
We'll take care of the meeting.
It's time to settle accounts with him.
Is it wrong to ask about the party funds?
No, it's not,
but you should be qualified for that.
He has no stature to do it.
So, now you don't see MJR's stature?!
We'd better not discuss someone's stature,
which is decided by film journals.
Everyone is interested
in only one thing…
where will he go for his
third honeymoon with Jaya?
Everything published in
the newspapers is not true.
That's what I am saying.
Aren't you questioning us
about the funds, believing the newspapers?
Then why can't we question
you based on what they write?
You've tarnished the party's image.
Wasn't it getting tarnished when you
were asking for votes in his name?
What did you say?
Did we win the elections because of him?
Look, I am not saying that
the party has won because of him.
But even he has put in a lot of effort.
Everything published in
the newspapers is not true.
You should at least make
him the education minister.
-Hey, what the heck are you saying?
-How can we do that?
How dare you say that!
Mind your tongue!
It's just wrong!
So, is this whole game…
for the sake of the minister's chair?
Not for the chair.
I want to do something for those
who placed their trust in me…
and voted for the party.
And a lot can be done in
the field of education.
Let's assume that you become a minister.
Now tell me, how would you
take time out for your ministry?
You are signing up for films back-to-back.
Will you do the shoots…
or run the ministry?
You have changed a lot.
You're bringing politics
into our friendship.
When you wanted votes,
you needed my films and me.
But not anymore.
It's your choice to sail in two boats.
And now…
you're putting the blame on me.
If you want to be a minister,
you have to give up not
only films but everything.
Everything.
Think about it.
It is you who needs to think, Karuna.
This paper boat of yours
will not float for too long.
Don't make such heavy statements.
Right. That's what you are good at.
I am good at speaking the truth.
I want to help my people out.
And I'll do it my way.
Once you leave,
don't ever think of coming back.
There will be no need for that.
Today, you have made
the gravest mistake of your life.
Whatever Karuna said was totally wrong.
But he was right about one thing.
Jaya.
If people don't accept us together,
then how come all our films are a hit?
Sir, films are different from politics.
We do anything in films.
Sir…
if a hero becomes a leader,
then people cheer for him.
But when a leader tries to become a hero--
What are you trying to say?
This relationship has no future, sir.
Then why are you still with her?
Not only Jaya but also millions
of other people will be hurt.
Only you can decide…
whom you want…
in this new and better
chapter of your life.
We almost drove through the entire city…
but there seems to be no end
to this road or your silence.
Where are we going?
To the place where only we
can hear our conversation.
Your expression was flat,
but your dialogue was very romantic.
Why is that?
If there'd been an answer for every "why,"
we wouldn't have had to meet this way.
When it comes to someone we love,
time and place do not matter.
We should just say what we feel.
Do you love me?
Sometimes you've hugged
me like my mother.
Sometimes you've made me
feel safe like my father.
Sometimes you've taught me like a mentor.
And sometimes, I've held you in my
heart and worshiped you like God.
God does not belong
to a particular individual.
I don't own my life anymore.
I have more responsibility toward
this state than my own people.
I don't understand what you're saying.
It's better for your future if
we are not together anymore.
Please don't leave me.
Are you leaving me?
Those in the heart…
can never move too far.
Day has broken into pieces
While night has set in fragments
Day has broken into pieces
While night has set in fragments
What sort of joy is this…
That keeps locking with grief?
The storm under the eyelashes
Is confined to the tears
It is confined to the tears
Day has broken into pieces
While night has set in fragments
Day has broken into pieces
While night has set in fragments
Mom, did the doctor examine you?
What did he say?
The doctor said that I don't
have to worry about anything.
After I am gone,
MJR will take care of you.
Nothing will happen to you.
We will go to our new house together.
We will certainly go.
But probably,
I won't be able to walk then.
Namaste, ma'am.
Mr. MJR has sent you a present.
To look happy is also an obligation
With a scream smothered in the heart
Silence speaks of the distance
My own has created from me
I have to suppress my tears
And I have to laugh as it's a necessity
Every day, my half-hearted spirit…
Ma'am, please eat something.
It appears complete to the naked eye
It appears complete to the naked eye
Ma'am, please sign this check. Then we
will transfer the amount to this account.
While night has set in fragments
I don't understand anything.
What can we do?
You must take care of everything.
How long can it go on like this?
While night has set in…
I heard about your mother.
I felt really sad.
But you were so busy that you
couldn't come for her last--
I wanted to come, but…
If you were in my place,
you would have probably understood.
I will never be in such a place.
We don't choose our destiny.
Destiny chooses us.
And what has our destiny chosen for me?
These secret meetings of ours?
I will decide the fate
of this relationship.
If you cannot meet me
in front of the world…
then I cannot meet you in secret either.
Respected MJR has been elected…
as the Chief Minister of
Tamil Nadu for the second time!
This victory is not his
alone but yours as well.
Therefore he is here among you
to thank you all for your support.
You all have gathered here
in such huge numbers for us,
and I am really grateful for that.
You guys have…
Did you see that, sir?
You have won their hearts.
It's a grand victory.
But if this victory gets to my head,
it can be more damaging than defeat.
Keep that in mind.
Have you checked the vote share?
We're not much ahead.
It's a narrow margin.
What are you saying, sir?
The public is here because you are here.
We have won only because of you.
An individual can be the face of a party.
He cannot become the entire party.
There is no dearth
of stalwarts in the Opposition.
Whereas we have no stalwarts at all.
Who pays such great attention
to scripts these days?
But your script is really good. Excellent.
You have agreed to do the film,
so we are very happy.
If you could give us your dates…
There are a couple of dance shows…
but we will manage.
Madam has said that your
film is the priority now.
You don't have to cancel anything.
We'll schedule around it.
We just need a week of madam's dates.
We will adjust the shoot accordingly.
Yes.
One week?
As per the script, your film will
require a minimum of 40 to 50 days.
Madhavan, didn't you tell her?
What are you talking about, sir?
We've approached madam for
the role of the heroine's elder sister.
What are you-- When did you tell me this?
How is this possible?
How can you say that?
Mr. Sureshan!
-What is happening?
-We had told him.
A tiger may get old…
but that doesn't make it a cat.
This is the timetable, sir.
We'll start the program
with a prayer at 4:00 p.m.
Please attend our program
if you find the time.
-I'll be there.
-Sir.
We think it'd be lovely if Miss Jaya
could perform at
the World Tamil Conference.
Who would want to watch
Jaya dance at this age?
Don't you have a better option?
Well…
If you think that Jaya is
a good choice for this program,
then you can approach her.
Okay, sir.
Let it be, sir.
This would be her last show.
Don't stress!
Mark my words, nobody will turn up.
Rajamma, what's this?
Ma'am, why are you doing this?
-I'll do it. Give--
-It's okay. I am quite free.
What is it?
There's this show.
I told them… that I'd check
with you and let them know.
What's there to check?
Dance is all we do now.
All my dates for this month are
also available. Say yes to them.
Where's the show?
Madurai.
It's a government program.
MJR will also be there.
Step on it. We're running late.
MJR must have arrived.
Quick.
Sir, I think Mr. MJR is here.
So much crowd?!
Where are the police?
Move! Get out of the way!
Come on! Move!
Ma'am!
As our eyes meet
Love flows through my veins
My heart flutters with anxiety
My breath starts getting heavier
The world echoes
With symphonies of love
Love rises
With an overwhelming emotion
Earth and sky
Are in close proximity
Yet the distance between them remains
Can night and day exist together?
Can silences speak?
Can the sun and rain
Ever unite?
As our eyes meet
Love flows through my veins
As our eyes meet
Love flows through my veins
My heart flutters with anxiety
My breath starts getting heavier
The world echoes
With symphonies of love
Love rises
With an overwhelming emotion
Are you in a hurry?
I thought of meeting you numerous times.
I thought a thousand times
about what I'd say when I see you.
Where would I begin?
What would happen?
You used to think so much about me?!
Didn't you ever miss me?
I did.
When I saw you today…
it all came back to me.
You haven't changed at all.
If I had changed, you'd have forgotten me.
I don't think you're happy to see me.
The man whom I considered my world…
is right in front of me today.
How can I not be happy?
But when I think it is just an illusion…
how can I be happy?
Ammu…
I want to say something.
If I weren't the CM, then I--
Just a minute.
If I weren't the CM…
do you know what I would've
done after watching you dance?
What?
Ammu.
I want you to enter public life.
But that's what I already do.
Acting and dancing are
a part of public life.
No. I mean you should join politics.
Politics!
It has taken everything away from me.
I hate that word.
That's the problem, Ammu.
People who truly belong in politics…
have a problem with it.
Politics is just like love.
Showing love is easy…
but standing by it is difficult.
I strongly believe that you'll own
the public just like you own the screen.
That's a different story.
Without a woman, a film falls bland.
But when a woman…
takes a position of power,
everybody gets irked.
Besides, I have no
understanding of politics.
What's there to understand?
It's plain and simple.
Love the public,
and they'll love you back.
-Look, there's a car coming. Go.
-Let's go.
-Buy some bananas from us.
-Please buy them, sister.
-Sister, please buy some.
-No, dear. We don't want it.
-Please buy them, sister.
-Come here.
Don't you go to school?
If I go to school, what will I eat?
By selling these, at least, I get to eat.
But you get food at school.
Look over there.
It says so on the poster.
REVOLUTIONARY LEADER, MJR
EAT HEALTHY AND GET HEALTHY
There's food only on the poster,
not in school.
How can I eat it from the poster?
GOVERNMENT PRIMARY SCHOOL
Sister, you were saying that
we'll get curry and broth here.
But this is just starch, and it stinks.
Okay, do one thing.
Close your eyes.
But why, sister?
Just do it.
Now open your mouth.
Good boy.
Now, this is sambar.
And…
this is rasam.
And lastly…
this is curry.
I'm in charge. What's the matter?
Does the government pay
you to feed kids such awful food?
Who gave you the right to question me?
Panchayat?
MLA? MP?
Or the CM?
Don't make an issue
out of anything. Leave.
Mind your language!
You're speaking to Madam Jaya!
Yeah, I know.
Just because she worked
with MJR in some films,
she thinks she is the CM.
You don't need to teach us
how the government works.
She's trying to teach me!
Sir.
Madam Jaya is here to see you.
What is she doing here?
Send her in.
Alright. I'll see you later, sir.
What's up, Ammu?
Have you decided to join politics?
Right now, I have only decided
to have lunch with you.
I have brought food for you.
After all, "Feed the hungry"
is your party's slogan.
Ammu… this looks stale.
Oh, really?
I have an idea. Close your eyes.
And think of this…
as sambar.
This is rasam.
And this is paneer.
I don't get the joke.
This is no joke.
This is the food
from your Midday Meal Scheme.
You wanted every kid to go to school,
to study, and to eat well.
But this is what your people…
feed the kids in your name.
Only announcing the schemes is not enough.
You also need to execute them well.
Why is she back?
Don't you get it, lady?
Walk straight in!
What's all this?
Food.
Good food.
Who do you think you are? MJR?
I don't think so…
but he surely does.
Sir.
Good day, sir.
What brings you here, sir?
Namaste, sir.
You… what are you-- Let's go home, sir.
I'll serve you good food.
Your termination letter.
But sir…
Stay home, and enjoy your good food.
But sir…
Don't you have a tumbler?
No.
Eat all you want today.
You won't get such food at school again.
Don't worry.
You will get such food every day now.
Thank you, teacher.
Don't thank me, thank her.
She's not just anybody.
She's Amma.
Where love
Is found
New bonds are formed
Even strangers
Become your own
Didn't I tell you, Ammu?
Love the public,
and they'll love you back.
The Midday Meal Scheme is
now your responsibility.
New beginnings and new destinations
New companions and new emotions
-I am here.
-Where there is an exchange of love
There, you'll find your true companion
Keep the good work going
Times are changing for good
It's a new dawn
The sun is setting to rise brighter
Amma, why don't you eat with us?
-Take this file. Give it to sir.
-Okay, ma'am.
We were expecting a girl
for the campaign, right?
Ma'am, she's the one I told you about.
The video camera lady.
She's Sasi.
Not many people know
about the Midday Meal Scheme.
We must take this scheme
to every household.
MARUMALARCHI TAMIZHAGA MAKKAL KAZHAGAM
Wherever time has led you
There rests all that belongs to you
If the time has taken your side today
There must be a purpose
Whatever your role demands
You've got to do it sincerely
It's amazing how paths cross
It's amazing how they walk together
It's amazing how the night descends
-Namaste, ma'am.
-Greetings, brother.
You gave us food.
Now please solve our electricity issue.
Amma!
How can the government that
couldn't protect the Lord's spear…
protect its people?
The Lord's spear has been stolen.
The priest has been murdered.
Where is the responsible
minister, RNV, now?
Why is the Chief Minister silent?
Do you really wish to cast your
valuable votes for such lousy people?
It's my challenge!
There is no one left in MTMK…
who is man enough to come here!
"NO ONE IN MTMK IS MAN ENOUGH."
If none of you are going, I'll go.
Sir, don't make decisions
in the heat of the moment.
Let things calm down.
The truth will come out eventually.
Truth has no wings or feet
to make an appearance.
They're shaming the men in our party.
-How can I not go?
-I'll go.
Sir, it's TMK's house.
Even the cops hesitate to go there.
It's not advisable for a lady to go there.
This won't end well, sir.
Please don't send her there.
What if something goes wrong?
John is right.
It's not safe for you to go there.
I'll go.
When the commander is here,
the king doesn't enter the battlefield.
-MJR… down down!
-MJR… down down!
-MJR… down down!
-MJR… down down!
Hit her!
Hit her!
Hit her!
Stop!
Don't hit me.
I am on your side.
MJR… down down!
MJR… down down!
MJR… down down!
MJR… down down!
I know that the title CM doesn't
make somebody a chief minister.
One has to work like a chief minister.
From the public temple,
God's idol has been stolen.
People's feelings are hurt.
But where is MJR?
He's busy feeding kids midday meals.
He doesn't realize what's more important,
kids' meals or God's offerings.
God gives us water.
And what is MJR doing?
He's trying to protect that water.
He is in a meeting…
with the Central Government
to discuss the Cauvery crisis.
It's not God's duty to bring
electricity to our households.
Or supply water.
God gives us water, not River Cauvery.
If he can't understand this, then how
can he become the chief minister?
MJR…
-Viva!
-Viva!
A million dreams depend on you
A million hopes are pinned on you
Because you are
A compass in a storm
Everyone is connected to you
And you are connected to God
You are amazing…
People had predicted that we won't even
get a hundred votes in the election…
but we won, and it's all because of you.
I've only done what I've learned from you.
From today,
you are our propaganda secretary.
What kind of post is that?
I guess it's a special post
created for a special friend.
Yeah, that's right.
A special post for someone special.
It's time for new gatherings
Where there is an exchange of love
There, you'll find your true companion
-Long live MJR!
-Long live MJR!
After having midday meals,
kids began to throw up and fall
unconscious leading to public fury.
Doctors have found out that
its cause is food poisoning.
The Opposition has demanded
action against Jaya.
Look at her. She just walks in
wearing a sari and thinks…
Such great speeches, such great
promises, but such small minds!
Just to put me down,
you are playing with children's lives?!
What?
What did you say?
I am playing with children's--
Don't give yourself too much importance.
Got it?
If you flap your wings too much,
you'll fall flat on your face!
I have just spread my wings.
I am yet to take off.
Time will decide…
whether my flight is higher or the sky.
Ramalingam.
Muthuswamy.
Sadashiv.
Why don't they ever
attend the party meetings?
They haven't even participated
in a rally for so long.
They say that they don't need
to attend these meetings or rallies.
We can't even say anything to them.
Write a notice.
A show-cause notice.
Sister, some of them are seniors leaders.
What does it matter?
No one is bigger than the party.
Namaste, sir.
What kind of a joke is this, sir!
What happened?
Now a film actress will teach
us what politics is about?!
Sir, she is throwing her weight around
only because she has your support.
You even created a new post for her, sir.
Propaganda Secretary.
Is she the Propaganda Secretary
or the Party President?
A gun is only valuable as
long as it has bullets.
If the party is a gun,
then we all are its bullets.
Only the hunter knows what sort
of bullet is good enough for a hunt.
And that hunter is Jaya.
Sir, I agree no one can match up to Jaya.
But who can make our party
leaders understand that?
They feel that seniority also matters.
It's true.
They may be seniors…
but we must respect
efficiency, not just age.
Sir, if Jaya comes here…
there will be dissent in the party.
Only if she stays here, right?
I am sending Jaya to Delhi.
As an MP.
Rajya Sabha MP.
She'll work on the alliance
with Congress for which…
we've been struggling for years.
Sir, do you think Jaya will be able
to do what we couldn't do in years?
What if she could?
Then it would be great, sir.
Our party's senior leaders
will automatically fall silent.
If she couldn't do it, it's still good.
At least, she wouldn't stay here.
AIR INDIA
Keep everything ready. We
have a meeting in the evening.
Okay, sir.
Ma'am.
Because of the protocol,
it is impossible to meet the PM
without a prior appointment.
How long can we sit here?
There's no need to worry.
Our work will be done today.
Okay, sir.
We want to meet Madam Indira.
Do you have an appointment?
Please inform her that
Mr. Karunanidhi has sent us.
-Let me check.
-Okay.
Ma'am, Mr. Karunanidhi has
sent someone to meet you.
Okay. You can go.
Yes, ma'am?
Yes. Sir?
You can go.
Whatever task Madam Indira has
assigned you, complete that first.
Oh, it's you.
What are you doing here?
We've come to meet Madam Indira.
You just want to meet her, right?
She will be visiting Madras
for some important work.
If you want, you can meet her
there after her work is done.
Okay?
It would be of no use though.
Because she is coming there
to topple your government.
Gopal!
She had summoned me to discuss the same.
Respected Speaker.
I request you…
to give my remaining speech time
to our South-Indian,
young parliamentarian, Jayalalitha
for her debut speech in the Parliament.
So that she can shed some light
on issues faced by Tamil Nadu before us.
Mr. Advani…
your request has been accepted.
Miss Jayalalitha.
You may begin your speech.
I, Jayalalitha,
extend my heartfelt greetings…
to all the eminent leaders…
seated in the House and to the Speaker.
Madam Prime Minister!
Our Honorable Chief Minister
of Tamil Nadu, Mr. M. J. Ramachandran,
is not one person.
He is the voice
of the four crore people of Tamil Nadu.
Unfortunately, because of
the language and political barriers,
he has not been able
to convey our problems to you.
That is why he sent me here.
This is my very first time.
But I do realize the value of this seat,
which was once occupied
by the great leader, Annadurai.
Prime Minister.
I have come to discuss
the electric power crisis of Tamil Nadu.
Our Kalpakkam Power Project is
under the Central Government,
and we have to share our
electricity with the other states.
I am not given enough time
to discuss the entire statistics
of the issue with you, but…
I tried to meet you.
Prime Minister, I don't
know if you are aware.
In Tamil Nadu,
people call you Amma affectionately.
And we expect…
our mother to treat all
her children equally.
Together we have built this nation.
Together, we can take it to great heights.
But we need your unbiased
love and support.
Madam.
Dravidian people are very competent.
Very intelligent.
I assure you…
if you give an ounce to Tamil Nadu,
it will give you back a pound.
Thank you.
The House is adjourned for a break.
I didn't know South Indians
could speak such good English.
I also didn't know North Indians
could understand such good English.
Wow! Beauty with brains!
What an amazing combination!
I'll ask MJR why he kept you
away from Delhi for so long.
-Thank you.
-Excuse me, ma'am.
Madam PM has given you
an appointment at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.
Sir, Jaya turned out
to be prompt in her actions.
She directly fixed
a meeting with Madam Indira.
I am sure you are aware of this.
I got no such call.
This is strange, sir.
Such great news, but you…
What sort of propaganda
could be behind this?
I have sent her on a good mission.
Maybe she'll tell me
when it is accomplished.
Ma'am, here are the statistics
I was talking about yesterday.
And the issue of electricity that…
we've been struggling with for so long…
What would we gain out of this alliance?
If you allocate us more
seats, we may consider it.
Definitely. I will speak to Mr. MJR.
What happened, ma'am?
I have done what no one in
the party could do until now.
-We should inform Mr. MJR, right?
-No.
I know when to inform him.
Following the meeting,
the alliance between MTMK
and Congress was sealed.
Addressing the press in Delhi,
Miss Jayalalitha said that
this alliance is significant…
You were right, sir.
Jaya has proved her capability.
The only problem is that we're
getting to know about our own party
through the news on TV.
Hello.
A trunk call?
From where?
From Delhi?
Yes. Please connect it.
Ammu.
Congratulations, Mr. RNV.
Madam Jaya has worked wonders.
We had never considered
an alliance with MTMK.
She is an exemplary leader.
We didn't know that…
she makes all the decisions of MTMK.
Sir.
Gopal had called from Delhi.
Nothing is in our favor now.
-Go on. I will see you in the office.
-Okay, ma'am.
Okay. Thank you.
Find yourself a taxi.
This car is for party officials.
What do you mean?
What I mean is, you have been removed
from the post of propaganda secretary.
I will send the dismissal
letter to your home.
You don't have to come
to the party office.
It feels so good…
to see you in pain.
You sent me to Delhi
not to win, but to lose.
You're not able to tolerate my success.
Had I failed, you would have
removed me using that as an excuse.
You have been removed
from the party even now, haven't you?
This is what they call politics.
So many people like you just come and go.
I never liked politics.
Nor did I ever need a party.
You had come to me then! Even now,
if you want to win the elections…
you will need me!
One more thing.
Many of them will come and go.
But there will be no one…
like Jaya!
What happened?
Nothing.
Are you not feeling well?
No… I am fine.
Some important news coming in now.
Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister,
Mr. M. J. Ramachandran,
has been admitted to Apollo Hospital
today due to sudden illness.
-Madhavan!
-What happened, sister?
MJR has been hospitalized,
and no one even told me! Get the car!
-How did it happen?
-Madhavan!
-I can't believe it.
-Madhavan!
-Get the car! We must go to the hospital!
-Wait, ma'am.
Mr. MJR has been taken
to the US for treatment.
Sir.
Mrs. Indira Gandhi has been assassinated.
She has been shot.
I got your campaign schedule, RNV.
I don't see Jaya's name on it.
It will be a great loss
for us without her.
Especially when MJR is also not there.
Mistake.
It was a typing mistake.
If she is not part of the campaign,
consider the alliance is over.
Yeah.
Campaign… she will do the campaign.
In the recent elections of Tamil Nadu,
MTMK has won in 195 constituencies.
-Long live MJR!
-Long live MJR!
-Long live MJR!
-Long live MJR!
-Long live MJR!
-Long live MJR!
You are great, Mr. MJR.
Even when you were not in
the country, you were able to win.
This could not have been
possible without Jaya.
Where is she?
Hello?
Hello?
Wait.
If you want to…
we can even speak in silence.
Think about something.
And I will know it.
Then you must also know
that I want to see you.
I want you to feed me with your hands.
Can we meet?
Right now?
Yes.
Rajamma!
Quickly make some sambar,
rasam, and lentils gravy--
Can we get some fresh fish now?
Also, make fish fry,
chicken gravy, mutton fry,
payasam and badusha.
Quick. Make it fast.
And make some halwa with saffron as well.
For how many people, Amma?
Just for one.
Rajamma!
Is the fry ready?
Give it to me.
Thank you.
Ma'am, Mr. MJR…
is no more.
What?!
Yes, ma'am.
Stop there! Move!
-Move aside! What are you doing, ma'am?
-I am a party member.
-Move!
-How can you stop me?
Come this way!
Move back!
Go from here!
Move back, ma'am!
Move!
I need to open the gate.
Move! Leave from here!
Move back!
Move back!
Back! Go back!
Make way!
MJR!
I am MTMK's general secretary.
And in the true sense,
I am Mr. M. J. Ramachandran's successor.
Who is Jaya to decide who
his political successor is?
Then what were so many senior people
doing with MJR for so many years?
Were they sitting idle?
We have been with him since the beginning.
Who has been with him since
the beginning doesn't make any difference.
What does make a difference is
who can take the reins
of the party today.
And the most important thing is whom
Mr. MJR considered as his political heir.
MJR has only one successor.
And that's Madam Janaki.
She is our party's general secretary.
We will make sure she wins the upcoming
election, and we'll elect her as the CM.
We have just received the results
of the Tamil Nadu Assembly Elections.
Tamizhaga Makkal Kazhagam
has won with a margin of 150 seats.
Mr. Karunanidhi has once again become
the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.
-Come on, quick!
-Please come.
We have won!
Who is the Opposition? Is it Congress?
Is it Madam Janaki?
No, sir.
It's Jaya.
Next time we will definitely win.
Let's think of this as
an experience and move forward.
But the public doesn't feel the same.
They have accepted Jaya as his successor.
Not me.
Truth is always bitter.
But I am ready to accept it.
I don't want politics.
-Hey, let go of me!
-Keep quiet, and just move!
Let go of me!
They are targeting our
leaders to settle old scores.
What did I do? Let go of me!
-Keep moving!
-Let go!
They have imprisoned all our MLAs.
Why have you imprisoned my MLAs?
False cases of corruption
have been slapped on us.
Our phones have been tapped.
Are you the Chief Minister or a despot?
Who are you to speak on behalf of MJR?
Are you MJR's wife?
Or his daughter?
Keep quiet!
You and your men humiliated me today…
in front of everyone in the Assembly…
the same way Draupadi was humiliated
by the Kauravas when they
tried to disrobe her.
She had won that power struggle.
And I shall win this power struggle.
Because the other name
for the Mahabharata is…
Jaya.
I take a vow today…
that I shall return to this Assembly…
only as the Chief Minister.
Whatever happened was not right.
This is a black day in
the history of politics.
-Namaste, sir.
-Namaste, sir.
Namaste, Mr. RNV.
Let's go.
All your life, you must have
considered me an adversary.
But I simply stood by MJR.
I am ashamed.
I just want to say that
in this very world of politics,
these kinds of attacks keep happening…
on our dignity and life.
But if you stay strong…
victory will be yours.
Forgive me.
Please wait.
If there are two warriors instead of one,
then courage and strength
will both increase immensely.
The party needs you as much
today as it needed you yesterday.
I guess she is totally
shaken after the incident.
Is she retiring from politics?
Good. Very good.
She is our leader.
Say a word against her, and I'll
make sure you regret it for life!
We should request the Central Government
to provide us security.
Your enemies are agitated.
You shouldn't go
anywhere without security.
When a woman is not safe in the Assembly
among those who protect the Constitution,
who can provide her security?
But sister…
DEVAKI HOSPITAL
-No, please--
-You need bed rest for at least
five to six months.
You cannot move at all.
Sir.
We just heard from the Center.
The Election Commission is
calling for a press conference.
And?
Elections for the CM post
may be held at any moment.
RNV, you don't seem to understand.
Your leader is not in a condition
to contest the election.
Your party won't be able
to win this election.
Mr. Rajiv,
please don't make a hasty decision.
If you remember,
the same thing had happened to MJR.
Still, we had won the election.
RNV.
Jaya is not MJR.
I am not MJR.
-Ma'am.
-Sister, careful.
But I have learned from him.
A warrior may get wounded in war…
but he should never turn back and flee.
I will contest this election.
Forging a new path
Whoever marches on
He owns the world
He owns the earth and sky
As thoughts transform
And words take a new meaning
Society will change too
Give such new direction
To the world around here
March, Thalaivii! March on!
With courage in every step
March, Thalaivii! March on!
Bringing every step closer
Pick up the staff in hand
And make the sky your companion
March on taking the world with you
No matter how bad the times
were, I never gave up!
I never bowed out or backed down!
Politics is not drama…
where you can just wear
makeup, and you're ready.
They have turned politics into drama.
They are fooling people.
The same people who line
up to cast their votes
without caring about the sun or rain.
First, they accused us of the accident.
And now that they are left with no weapon,
they're using tears.
One can't play politics using tears!
Am I not a part
of Mr. Rajiv's rally on the 21st?
No. He has sent a message saying that…
there is not enough time,
so it is better to campaign individually.
This is the battlefield
With all the conspiracies
We are falling short of time
So, do all you can for victory
However beautiful the dawn
And however amazing the battle may be
I am her father in politics.
She is just a kid in front of me.
When Lord Krishna killed
Kans, he was a kid too.
Age has nothing to do with prudence.
Pick up your scepter
I promise you today…
that I will always be by your side.
But I need a promise from you as well.
I want you all to promise me that
even you all will be by my side.
March, Thalaivii! March on!
Bringing courage with your every step
This is people's fight.
It's the fight for the people.
It's the fight between good and evil.
From the reports coming in just now,
our former Prime Minister,
Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, has been assassinated.
The primary investigation revealed that…
he was killed by a human bomb during
the election campaign in Sriperumbudur.
We plan something, but destiny has
its own way of working things out.
Brother… this is a man's world.
It's run by men.
And we have allowed a woman to lead us.
We will have a mortifying
defeat in this election.
She couldn't even protect herself.
How would she protect the party?
We are here because of Mr. Rajiv Gandhi.
Now he is no more, and there is
no money left in the party either.
What should we do now?
How are we going to face the election?
Hey!
What are you blabbering?
Yes, it's true…
that this world is run by men.
But has it ever occurred to you…
that it is a woman who enables men?
When will you trust us?
How long do we
have to keep proving ourselves?
These are my house papers.
Mortgage them.
This is my jewelry.
And these are my entire earnings.
I have wagered everything I own.
But remember…
we shall win this election,
not with money,
but with our ability.
And if you don't have it in you,
you can leave the party right now!
Our fight is for people.
It's for justice.
It's for our self-esteem.
We may fall in this battle.
We may get wounded.
But now… we cannot back down.
The public wants to see us in power.
This time, the end of MTMK is certain.
Ma'am.
Ma'am, I'll get going.
Give me the injection and go.
My backache is killing me.
Ma'am.
So many steroids have been injected
into your body in such a short time.
You are an intern. Don't try to act like
a doctor. I have spoken to the doctor.
Just give me the shot.
What does it matter
to you whether I live or die?
It does matter to me. Of course, it does.
I know… that your victory is
going to be every woman's victory.
It's going to be Tamil Nadu's victory.
You have saved me
and millions like me from hunger.
You have given me…
the gift of life…
and my education.
I remember even today…
about the time when your car had
stopped at the railroad crossing.
Sleep at least for an hour.
You've got to stay alive.
For us.
Don't concede defeat
Don't break the journey
Be broken, but keep shining
Be broken, but keep shining
Every step that you put forward
Don't ever back down
Pick up your scepter
Pick up your scepter
March, Thalaivii! March on!
With courage in every step
March, Thalaivii! March on!
Bringing every step closer
Pick up the staff in hand
And make the sky your companion
March on taking the world with you
It's a new day
Your enemy's defeat is certain
Pick up your scepter
In the Mylapore district,
the MTMK candidate is leading
with 2000 votes over the TMK candidate.
I have the results in my hand.
TMK candidate, Mr. Ilamvazhuthi,
has won with 5000 votes.
If this woman continues to lead
us, we will fall flat on our faces.
Forget that. We are not even
fit to form the Opposition.
Congress candidate, Mr. Annanagril,
has won against TMK's
Anbalagan with 25,500 votes.
From Tugdiyal Constituency, MTMK's J. Jaya
has won with a marked difference of
25,540 votes against the TMK candidate.
Hello.
Sir!
Hello?
Sir!
Two seats, sir!
Two seats?
-Only two seats?
-What are you saying?
-Is this some kind of a joke!
-It's such a shame for us!
-I had warned you not to trust her!
-Hey, calm down.
Tell me now. How many seats have we won?
I can't believe this.
Okay.
Damn!
We have won.
We won!
We have defeated them!
Tamil Nadu Assembly Election
results have been declared today.
In these elections, Tamizhaga
Makkal Kazhagam has lost miserably.
Only a few leaders like Mr. Karuna and
Mr. Ilamvazhuthi could register a win.
Under the leadership of Selvi Jaya,
MTMK has won in 225 constituencies…
I am…
going to resign.
I, Jayalalitha, swear in the name of God…
that I will bear true faith and allegiance
to the Constitution of India
as by law established,
that I will uphold
the sovereignty and integrity of India,
that I will faithfully
and conscientiously discharge my duties
as a Minister for the state of Tamil Nadu…
and that I will do right
to all manner of people
in accordance with
the Constitution and the law,
without fear or favor,
affection or ill will.
I take a vow today…
that I shall return to this
Assembly only as the Chief Minister.
Didn't I tell you, Ammu?
Love the public
and they'll love you back.
-Namaste, ma'am.
-Namaste, ma'am.
Have a seat.
-No, it's okay.
-We are good, ma'am.
Sit down.
-We're good.
-We're good, ma'am.
Take away the chairs.
Remember this.
If you consider me your mother…
then you will have a place in my heart.
But if you just consider me
a woman, then…
