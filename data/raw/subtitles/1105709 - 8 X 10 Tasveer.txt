Of some unseen picture.

There are visions. -Yes.
There are visions. -Yes.
There are visions. -Yes.
There is some intoxication,

ls this some problem
or some mistake?
Danger of the past events.
Danger of other things.
Of all the forgotten moments.
There are visions.-Yes.
There are visions.-Yes.
There are visions.-Yes.
Of some unseen picture.
There are visions.-Yes.
There are visions.-Yes.
What happened, Jai? Tell
me. What happened, Jai?
l'll be there.
Hi Wayne.
Buddy, why do you
keep coming back?
The bears hate you.
-And so do we.
All right buddy. You
know the drill.
Hands behind your head. And
step away from the trap.
Come on.
What are you smiling at?
No evidence. No crime.
Freaking mad man.
Well, call me for the funeral.
Come on. lt's almost
been four minutes.
Guys, listen up. 100 foot cliff.
Four minutes under the water.
And that ladies and gentlemen,
is a new world record.
Stop exaggerating John
But drink's on me tonight.
One bear trap as evidence.-Thank
you.
They've been waiting for
you all morning. -Who?
Those ladies over there.
Why? -No idea.
Hello Ms. Soniya, how are you?
l'm fine. Thank you. She
is my friend, Emily.
Hello. -Hi.
Her husband is missing.
She needs your help.
Why don't you take
her to the police?
She went there. lt's been a
week. He is still missing.
Jai, if not for you. .
. .today my child wouldn't
have been alive.
ln your case, you were lucky
as you had a photograph.
She has a photograph too. That's
why l've brought her here.
Please.
Okay, l'll try.
When was this photograph taken?
-Just at that time.
A minute after clicking the
photograph, Emily went to the bathroom.
When she returned,
he wasn't there.
l'll need some luck, because after
a minute my life will be in danger.
Oh, it's really good
l'm just going to
he ladies' room.
Hurry back. We have to get back
to the cabin before dark.
Okay.
l'll wait here by the car.
He fell in the ravine.
Sampson Trail.
Near Mile marker. 0.4.
He is alive, but injured.
He is alive.
Thank you so much. -Thanks, bye.
Take good care of your
husband. Okay.
Jai, l've been trying
to call you !
There's been an accident.
Dad. Dad. -Jai, On the
boat. On the boat.
l saw. .
How are you, Savitri?
How are you?
As per Jatin's wish, l'm going
to read out his will.
There are 12 pages
of legal terms.
But the gist is this.
'l'm leaving everything
for Savitri.'
Savitri, you have to
sign some papers.
l don't believe this. How can
a father do this to his son?
As it is, l never
wanted his money.
l know. But it feels bad.
When one doesn't leave anything
for his only son.
Does it matter? lt's all
right. lt's okay.
All right. As it is, what do l
care when you're with me? -Thank you.
l felt bad about what
happened yesterday.
What is there to feel
bad, Mother?
You know what l think
about dad's business.
Don't be so angry with your dad.
l'm not angry, Ma. l'm just sad.
Dad never understood
my point of view.
That's not it, Jai. Jatin
was going to change.
Jatin was going to transfer
all his wealth. .
. .in your organisation's name.
ln the name of my organisation?
He knew that this was the
only way to win you back.
Maybe this is what he wanted
to tell me that day.
That day in the morning,dad
came to meet me.
'Good morning, Dad.'
'Are you sure you won't
come with us?'
'You know my answer.'
'Today is a special day, Son.'
'What's so special, Dad?'
'Your oil company's
annual party.'
'Announcement of profits.'
The environment's loss and
your profit. That's all.'
'l know you're not happy
with my business.'
'But today l'm going
to do something. .
. .which will make you
proud of your dad.'
'Good. Good, Dad. l
am happy for you.'
l was not ready to
listen to him.
Son, please. -Bye, Dad.'
lt's okay, Jai.
'Help me, Son.'
Same dream again? -No.
Now we will have to deal
with another dream.
l love you.
Will you marry me?
l don't know how this question
popped in my mind?
l know it's been only a year
since we've known each other.
But l feel l've found
my life partner.
l don't want to lose you
the way l lost dad.
Will you be Mrs. Jai Puri?
Yes.
Great smile.
Yes.
He wanted us to remember
him this way.
A drink in the name of life.
Jai, someone's here to meet you.
Yes?
Hi. l'm Habibullah Pasha.
Also known as Happi.
and not a Y.
Yes. -How can l help you?
l forgot. l'm Detective
Habibullah Pasha.
Also known as Happi.
With an l.
Shall we sit?
lt hurts after a while.
Your father was a nice man.
He helped me a lot
when l came here.
He gave me money,
a place to stay.
Everything.
l live in Toronto.
l've come here unofficially,
straight from the airport.
The case doesn't look
that straight.
Your father was a good swimmer.
All his life he travelled
in boats.
So how did he drown so easily?
He didn't drown. He suffered
a heart attack.
Did he have any enemies?
Many people were upset with him.
l was one of them.
So did you do this?
What?
Now listen, detective
Happi with an l.
Leave with your guns and
weapons. Okay, goodbye.
Look, l want to ask you
something before leaving.
Who benefited from his death?
Think about this.
l have a theory. Will
you listen to it?
No?
Hi baby face.
Happi, how are you? -Very
fine. Thank you.
Let's go.
Sir, could you please
walk me through it?
l was standing there
on the boat.
And l heard a sound.
Sunder shouted out.
Well, l gave him his drink.
And he sat there.
And suddenly he slipped. -Why
did Mr. Puri sit on the railing?
That was his favourite spot.
He always sat there
Who was standing closest to
Mr. Puri when he fell?
What conversations did you have
with Mr. Puri on the yatch that day?
Just casual. You know we've been
friends for a very long time.
Was Jatin a good swimmer?
He was a very, very
good swimmer.
Where were you when
he fell overboard?
l had to go and see to the food.
Hi. -Hi.
Good morning. -Good morning.
Hi -Good morning.
lt's a great day today.
Let's go.
Hello. -This is Happi
with an 'l'.
l thought we have spoken,
Detective.
Last night l checked your
father's case file.
l told you it was an accident.
Do you know my friend Andy
wanted to conduct his post-mortem?
We did not have legal rights.
We could only request.
And?
Someone forbid her from
conducting the post-mortem.
Who? -Your mother.
You think l've murdered
your dad.
No, Mother. l just want
to know your reason. .
. .for refusing the post-mortem.
The reason is that l didn't want
your dad's body to be dissected.
As a Hindu, how could l have
given permission for this autopsy?
Ma, this is bullshit.
Can't you forget these religious
things to get to the truth?
What truth are you
talking about?
We all were there. Your dad's
four well-wishers.
We saw him slip into the water.
We saw him getting
a heart attack.
He died in my arms.
l am sorry mother.
But what do l do?
l met that man called
Habibullah Pasha.
What did you say is his name?
He calls himself Happi.
-Happi with an l.
How do you know?
We'd helped him when
he had shifted here.
He told me.
He must have also
told you that. .
. .he was dismissed from
the police force.
Because he suffered from
paranoid delusion and OCD.
To escape ignominy, he
ran away to Toronto.
No?
You can't trust him,
Son. He is insane.
Thank you very much.
ctually, he is quite harmless.
l've known him for a long time.
l would appreciate if he stays
away from me and my family.
lf you need anything else,
just give me a call.
Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.
Hang on. Hang on. Please.
Listen to me.
Listen, l've told the
police everything.
lf you don't want to get
arrested, then just get out of here.
But we have to find your
father's killer?
My father was not murdered.
He was. To prove this,
l need your help.
l'm really tense. And l don't
want to talk to a crazy fellow.
Just go.
Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.
Please. Hang on.
Assume this just for a second.
Jatin was murdered.
lf he had been alive, he would
have told you that l'm not insane.
But he is no more.
lt's so sad.
For me and for you too.
Listen to me, and go
back to Toronto.
l was not dismissed from
the police force.
l myself left the service.
You can think whatever you want.
But l'll surely catch
the murderer.
'On the boat l saw. .'
'What truth are you
talking about?'
'Jatin was murdered.'
Good that mom clicked this
snap before the accident.'
Show me the truth, Dad.
'Jatin, enough. You've
had enough to drink.'
Savitri, from tomorrow our
new journey will begin.'
'ln the name of that journey. .'
'Cheers. -Cheers.'
'Cheers.'
'Cheers, Uncle.'
'With this champagne, l
cleanse all my sins.'
'Sunder, another glass, if you
please. -Sure. l'll get it.'
'l'm serving lunch.'
'l'll help you with
that, Aunt. -Okay.'
As my friend and my lawyer, you
have always supported me.'
'And l'm sorry about what
is going to happen.'
'What are you saying, Uncle?
l'm indebted to you.'
'Thanks. This is what
l wanted to hear.'
'Sunder, my glass please.
-There you go.'
'Thank you.'
'Do you mind?'
'When has my opinion ever
mattered to you. .'
. .that today you're playing
this charade?'
'Come on, Sunder. Money
is not everything.'
'Help, help.'
Oh Sheila.
How is he?
The doctor said that never
before has he seen such a case.
He had to be given a
blood transfusion.
Are you hiding something
from me?
Jai used to get these fits
when he was a kid.
What fits?
He'd become almost lifeless,
with his eyes staring.
He would regain consciousness,
and know somebody's secret.
As if he had peeped
into their past.
Hey, champ. -Hi.
How are you doing? -Okay.
Sheila, you rest.
l'll stay here.
He is going to be discharged.
All his reports are normal.
Wonderful. -l'll go and get
the discharge papers.
Sit.
Tell me. What's the matter?
l know you very well. Something
is surely the matter.
l think dad was murdered.
What?
Dude, l think because of this
emotional breakdown. .
No, it's not an emotional
breakdown.
So how could you think of
something so senseless?
l have a secret.
Through the photograph, l went
there. On the same boat.
At that same time. l saw
what happened there.
That railing broke. . -Hang on.
You can say this to a foolish
man. Not to your friend.
That's why l didn't tell Sheila.
Do you even know how
weird this sounds?
Your dad's death was
an accident. Fact.
You can't cope with it. Fact.
You can see the past with the
help of 8x 10 photograph?
lnsanity.
Am l interrupting something?
Nothing, Sheila.
l don't even know why l
am this idiot's friend.
He has gone mad.
'Uncle Sunder was
closest to dad.'
'He saw him slipping
into the water.'
'Why didn't he mention
the broken railing?'
And if the railing was broken. .
. .Who repaired it?'
Why did you run away?
Leave me.
Why have you come here?
l called you so many times.But
your cell is switched off.
There is a reason.
That police officer
is following me.
Why? -He suspects me.
Have you've murdered dad?
You're asking me this?
Oh, God.
l'll find out the truth.
Can we talk?
What's your theory?
What's your theory?
Massive myocardial infarction
resulting due to hypothermia.
Heart attack.
He fell into the cold water.
That's why his heart stopped.
We all know that. how
is it your theory?
Do you know what are
beta-blockers?
l consume these small pills
for my blood pressure.
Due to stress, l get mad.
So l have to take them.
Happi's pills.
lt slows down the heartbeat. And
the blood pressure remains normal.
l don't understand.
All the people on the
boat knew that. .
. .Jatin had suffered two
heart attacks, right?
Somebody gave him extra
beta-blocker.
And then pushed him
into cold water.
That's why he suffered
a heart attack.
Neither did my dad slip, nor
did anybody push him.
How can you be so sure?
lf l told you, you
won't believe me.
My dad always sat on the
railing of the boat.
Keeping his feet on the cooler.
Putting his weight on the railing.
Somebody cut the rod
before his arrival.
He sat there. He put the weight
of his body on it.
That railing broke. And he
slipped into the water.
After that, the railing
was repaired.
So that nobody gets suspicious.
-Nice theory.
But who did it and why?
'Leave me.'
Uncle Sunder.
Oh. -Why were you following
Uncle Sunder?
Didn't l tell you?
lf you had told me then
would l have asked you?
He booked a ticket to lndia.
Can't you stop him? -No proof.
We need evidence to make
our theories work.
'Jatin, enough. You've
had enough.'
'Savitri, in the name of
a new journey. Cheers.'
'Sunder, another glass, if you
please. -Sure. l'll get it.'
'l'm serving lunch.'
'l'll help you with that, Aunt.'
'No hard feelings, okay.'
'What are you saying, Uncle?
l'm indebted to you.'
'That is what l wanted to hear.'
'Sunder, my glass please.
-There you go.'
Thank you, Sunder.'
Uncle Sunder murdered dad.
Uncle Sunder. .
Hi, Sweetie.
Forget all that. Now that you're
awake, tell me clearly.
What the hell is going on?
You won't believe me.
Let's see. You accuse people
of murdering your dad. .
. .when you know it
was an accident.
Every alternate day, you're
admitted to the hospital.
And your state is such that even
the doctors are shocked.
l'm standing in front of you.
l'll believe anything you say.
Even that Dracula comes
and sucks your blood.
l'll tell you everything
in the car.
So through a photograph you have
found that your dad was murdered.
Exactly.
l saw uncle Sunder mixing the
pills in the champagne.
You know how crazy it
sounds, don't you?
l know.
That's why l'll have
to do something.
lf uncle Sunder has
murdered your dad. .
. .then we should inform
the police.
Why have we come here?
Nobody will believe us.
l want to threaten him and make
him spill out the truth.
Bad idea.
You stay here.
Uncle.
Uncle.
Uncle.
Bad idea.
Okay.
Listen. l'll search upstairs.
You search downstairs.
Search for what? -The proof.
ln movies, normally a dead body
is found in such a situation.
One, two, three.
Jai.
You should take a closer
look at this note.
Hi. -Hi, Happi.
Can l have a quick word
with him? -Sure.
Thanks.
Hi, Jai.
You must be Sheila.
Happi with an 'l'.
So this was your proof?
Your theory was right.
Uncle Sunder mixed the
pills in dad's drink.
How do you know?
What about the suicide note?
Are you fooled by the suicide?
At the moment, all doors are
closed. -l don't believe
There is somebody else.
Sheila, l suggest don't let
him do anything foolish.
l will try but he won't listen.
That vehicle is tailing us.
Which one?
l'm observing it since
the last 10 minutes.
Are you okay? -Don't touch me.
l'm sorry. -Your obsession
will kill both of us.
This incident proves that
there is somebody. .
. .who doesn't want me
to know the truth.
What price will you pay
to know this truth?
Your life, or maybe mine.
l promise you. Nothing
will happen to you.
Why don't you forget this
photograph nonsense. .
. .and let the police
do their work?
lf this is nonsense, then how
did l know what happened in the boat?
There is no evidence, Jai.
No evidence, no proof.
Just your theories. And, maybe
this is your delusion.
What do you think?
l've gone mad?
l don't know. Okay.
l just know that along with
you l am going mad too.
Why are you so angry?
Because l know that you'll
never listen to me.
And you'll again visit that
ill-fated photograph. .
. .or wherever it is that you go.
l'm fed up, Jai.
Okay. l won't do it again.
Really?
My heart has found solace.
My heart is happy.
What do l tell you?
Now this journey
has become easy.
With you as my life partner.
My heart has found solace.
My heart is happy.
What do l tell you?
There is no pity, beloved.
You're near me.
There is no pain, no sorrow.
When your love is with me,
everything is fine.
Somewhat like this.
Your company is like
a prayer answered.
This moment and this
weather is ours.
Come and lose yourself
in my love.
My heart has found solace.
Somewhat like this.
My heart has found solace.
Somewhat like this.
My heart is happy.
What do l tell you?
l really think. .
l really am sorry about
what's happened.
Am l disturbing you?
Jai, its not what you think.
lt's disgusting, Mother.-Please.
Please let me explain.
What is there to understand,
Mother?
Everything can be clearly
seen. -Hang on.
Before uttering any nonsense,
listen to me.
Yes. l love your mother.
l've always loved her.
But she chose Jatin. And
l had to accept this.
Now when dad is dead,
you both. . -Quiet.
How dare you, Jai.
l think you both murdered dad.
-Again the same nonsense.
This photograph business
is driving you insane.
Sheila told you?
You should consult a doctor.
Fantastic. Now he also
knows about it.
That's not the case. You're
very confused.
Maybe you all are
in this together.
But l'll surely know the truth.
And yes. .l'd brought my
luggage to live here.
But l guess, it's overcrowded.
Please, Jai.
l had some urgent work. That's
why l called you.
Did you murder dad?
You're drunk.
Forget that. Did you do it?
l've asked everyone.
Only you were left.
l hope you understand.
Come on, Jai.
Maybe you had arguments with
dad regarding business.
Maybe you both had a fight
and you got angry.
He was like a father
figure to me.
More than you, he considered
me his son.
l don't understand what to do.
There are so many questions.
But no answers.
l can't trust anybody. And
nobody can believe me.
Everybody is saying
l have gone mad.
What do you think?
Have l gone mad?
Nonsense. Listen to me.
Stop following ghosts.
Chill.
Jai. Shit.
Today is my happy birthday.
Happy with a 'Y'.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
l called up EPS many times.
They said you haven't come
to work since a week.
l needed some time off.
Who will know this
better than me?
Your mind is muddled
with thoughts.
l want you to meet Bibiji.
She is a renowned person.
Maybe she can help you.
You know. .
You too don't believe me.
Going inside the photograph,
seeing the past.
Can't digest it.
After all, l'm a police officer.
l too had many problems.
But Bibiji's miracle cured me.
What? What?
ls Bibiji there?
This photo depicts death.
Can you tell me what this is?
Have l gone mad, or
am l seeing things?
The life of a man, is like a
journey through pictures.
Many pictures.
Like these tarot cards.
Every picture captures a moment.
Our ancestors would draw
pictures on walls. .
. .and we click pictures.
The motive is still the same.
Capturing the moment.
What has that got to do with me?
You have the power,
using which. .
. .you can use current
photographs as a medium. .
. .to peep into the past.
But how did l develop
this power?
There must have been
an incident. .
. .that prompted this power
inside you to awaken.
What incident?
Only your past has an answer
to this question.
Remember, the more time
you spend in the past. .
. .returning to the present will
get difficult. -l know.
lf l stay in the past for
more than one minute. .
. .it feels like l barely
escaped death.
Be careful, you can lose
all means of returning.
What do you mean?
The pictures are your
way in and out.
lf you are inside the picture. .
. .and someone destroys
it or tears it apart.
Then you will be trapped
in there forever.
There's just one thing
left to do.
Look for the truth.
Only this picture will
reveal the truth.
lt ends today. -Damn
that Bibiji.
Thanks man, for being with
me. -Damn that Bibiji.
Uncle Sunder was not alone.
Someone was with him.
We just have to find
that out. -l agree.
But what will we do now?
-Just wait and watch.
Where do we have to go?
Damn that Bibiji.
What's wrong?
She's the reason,
why l ran away.
Hi, Sally.
Look who's back from the dead?
Happi, with an 'l'.
You know you are a scoundrel.
You ran away leaving a girl
stranded on the marriage dais.
And that too when l was bearing
all the expenses of the marriage.
After convincing my parents. .
. .that you are not as
cheap as you look.
l gathered my entire family
scattered all around the world.
Just so that l can spend
my entire life. .
. .with a lousy police
officer like you.
Do you want to say something?
l need a favour.
You know l can lose my
job for this. -Yes.
l feel like strangling
you Habibullah pasha.
Yes, Sally.
God, you frustrate me.
lf you need me, l'll be at the
nurse's station. -Yes, Sally.
No one will come inside.
She's quite scary. -Not scary,
she's very lovable.
Ready. -Yes, but for what.
Just be ready to transfuse
the blood.
When? -When l come back.
From where?
'Stop it Jatin, you
have had enough.'
'ln the name of that journey. .'
'Cheers.'
'Sunder, another glass, if you
please. -Sure. l'll get it.'
'And l'm sorry about what
is going to happen.'
'Savitri, l was asked to bring
the papers. -l know.'
'lt would be too late tomorrow.
-lt's his decision.'
'We must stop him. -l am
not a part of this.'
'You can't just agree
with him every time.'
'Help. Help.'
Look, the beep is
getting slower.
ls he dead?
Sorry, l called her here.
l thought you are dead.
You would have done the same
if you had seen yourself.
Staring with eyes wide open.
Sheila, he's going to do that
again. Please stop him.
Please sweetheart.
-Just one left.
Either l do it here in the
hospital, with everyone.
Or l will do it alone.
But Sweetie, l will do it.
Stop it Jatin, you
have had enough.'
'From tomorrow, our new
journey will begin.'
'Cheers. -Cheers.'
Sunder, another glass, if you
please. -Sure. l'll get it.'
'l'm serving lunch.'
'l'll help you with
that, Aunt. -Okay.'
As my friend and lawyer, you
have always supported me.
'And l'm sorry about what
is going to happen.'
'Adit. -Yes, Uncle.'
No hard feelings. -What
are you saying, Uncle?
l was always indebted to you.
'Thanks kid. That's what
l was waiting to hear.'
Thank God. -Yes.
We thought. .
You have put me in
trouble again.
Sally, come let's go.
l know everything now.
Hi.
Hi.
l called him.
Hey buddy.
He'll drop you home.
l have some urgent
work to attend to.
l will have to leave.
Go on.
l am not going anywhere, sweety.
l'll be right back.
So you know.
You couldn't stop meddling,
isn't it?
Why did you do it?
Money, Jai.
That's the most obvious answer.
Adit, help Jai to the wheel
chair. -Sure, Sheila.
Come on, buddy.
l am going to help you.
l'll keep this.
Did we get an answer
to our questions?
Nothing at all.
Did you ever miss
me? -Yes, Sally.
God, you frustrate
me. -Yes, Sally.
You came back when you needed
a favour. -Yes, Sally.
You should think about me
as well. -Yes, Sally.
Let's meet on Saturday.
-Yes, Sally.
Get some rest, l'll
see you later.
Bye sweetheart, see
you later, okay.
Bye, thanks so much.
-My pleasure.
Time for a joyride, buddy.
Don't try to act smart like
you just did in the lift.
Now we'll get into the car,
take care of business.
And you, my friend,
will be a good boy.
What do you think, you won?
The game is not over yet.
Are you fine? -Stop him.
'This picture depicts death.'
'Some incident.'
'What happened, Jai?'
lt's okay. lt's okay.
lt's okay. You are not
in danger now. -Hi.
He was here the entire night.
Didn't leave you alone
for a moment.
Did you catch Adit? -No,
he disappeared.
Office, house, bank accounts.
He took everything, and left.
Don't worry?
He can't run far.
Are you happy now?
lt's not over, is it? -No.
Hello uncle.
One day, Jatin called
us all for a meeting.
'l called everyone here
for a special reason.'
'l have an announcement
to make.'
'l am going to transfer
everything in the name of EPS.'
Savitri, Sunder, Adit and
l, as the shareholders. .
.would incur huge loses because
of this decision.
'That's not fair.-Why, Jatin?'
We were trying to stop him.
As the majority shareholder,
this is my decision to make.
l was hoping that Savitri
would help us.
But Mother wouldn't agree.
She always wanted to
take father's side.
Oh, so that's what you were
telling mother that day?
'Jatin asked me to get
the papers that day.'
But before he could sign them. .
Don't worry, his last wish
is being fulfilled.
Now the company is
in Savitri's name.
And now, she's going to
do what Jatin wanted.
Today, the entire wealth will be
transferred in the name of EPS.
Today? -Sheila, gave all
the papers to Savitri.
And whoever murdered dad for
the Canoil deal, he can. .
Oh my God, mom.
So suddenly, without informing.
Come.
Your timing is perfect.
l was about to sign
on the agreement.
l am very happy today.
At last Jatin's dreams
will be fulfilled.
Come on.
A toast. ln the name of life.
Pick up the phone, mother.
Mom. No, Mom.
Up in the attic. . Father. .
Please stay with mom
in the hospital.
l need to take care
of something.
l'll stay with her, don't worry.
Hi baby, what's up?
-Where are you?
Going home, from
the office. Why?
Get out of there, you are
not safe. Go home.
What do you mean? -Sheila,
it's not over.
l have to do something.
Jai, when will this end.
Try to understand, l know
everything now. Okay.
l'll see you at home, bye. -Bye.
Please don't tell me.
l hope your useless friend
won't deceive me again.
l'll make sure that
doesn't happen.
But please, l need your help.
Please.
This is an adrenaline injection.
You will regain consciousness
instantly.
But remember, you can
even lose your life.
Thank you.
Hello, Happi. -Sally called.
l hope it isn't about those
pictures again. -Yes.
The truth was always right
in front of my eyes. .
. .but l could never see it.
Congratulations. Will you
explain me this new theory.
Dad wanted to show me that.
On the boat, l saw. .
Dad saw someone else on the
boat other than those four.
But when the entered the
pictures the first time. .
. .l came out without knowing
the entire truth.
Jai, you should stop doing this.
lt can be fatal. -This
is the last time.
Partner, that's what you
said the last time.
Even Sally thinks
it's too risky.
Happi, listen Don't deceive
Sally again. -l won't.
But please listen to me,
it is very risky.
Bye. -Partner.
'Cheers. -Cheers.'
'l am serving food. -l'll help
you with that, Aunt.'
You have greatly helped me in
this.'way in and out of it.'
'The photos are your only
way in and out of
'lf you are inside, and
someone destroys it. .
. .or eradicates it, you'll
be trapped inside forever.
An incident, that provoked. .
. .this power inside
you to awaken.'
'The answer lies in your past.'
'What happened, Jai?'
'What happened?'
'Why are you quiet?'
'Jai'
'Tell me something.'
'What happened, Jai?'
'Where is Jeet?'
'What happened with Jeet?'
'Jai. Jai.'
'There are some treatments. .
-We've tried everything, Doctor.'
'There's an extreme method.'
'But normally l don't recommend
it to anyone.'
'Get rid of all of Jeet's
memorabilia.'
'His clothes, his toys.'
'And especially, his
photographs.'
'l don't know how he's
related to it.'
'But keep these photographs
away from him.'
'There shouldn't be anything
than can remind him of Jeet.'
'lf possible, you should leave
this city as well.'
'We have a vast business
in Canada.'
'Why don't we shift there?'
Hello, Brother.
Same to same.
Switch that off.
l wish Jai could see this.
Thanks to Bibiji, my
work got lot easier.
No knives or gun.
Just set a photograph on
fire. And he's dead.
Are we ready baby? -Absolutely,
darling.
We are completely ready
for the switch.
And we are going around
and around and around
Just imagine, l am Jai Puri.
The sole and sad inheritor of
millions of Canoil company.
God, you are brilliant Jeet.
No Jeet. No Jeet, get into the
habit of calling me Jai. .
After so many years, Brother.
And l thought you died
because of me.
That's what you wanted.
That was an accident.
No, l want that life back which
you snatched from me.
You said he's dead.
l checked his breath
a minute ago.
Should have checked properly.
What do you mean, l should
have checked properly.
And you left a loaded gun
by his side. How stupid.
Just shut up. -Shut up.
Why did you do this, Sheila?
Stop this emotional crap, Jai.
l love Jeet, and l always have.
What you and your family
did with him. .
And l loved you. -l
know, sweetheart.
You loved me, protected me.
You wanted to marry me as well.
Well done.
Jeet.
Jeet, be careful.
Hi, Happi. What's up?
Jai isn't picking up his phone.
ls he fine? -Yes, why?
He's sleeping.
No. . He said he'll be entering
the picture again.
Sorry, l didn't understand?
Happi, everything is fine.
No, but Jai said
Oh my God.
l am sorry, Happi.
He said if l tell you anything
he will kill Jai.
Happi, l am Jai.
Don't believe him.
-Happi, l am Jai.
No he's lying, l am Jai.
Happi, he shot me. Look.
No, don't be fooled
by him, Happi.
He's lying. l am Jai
-Help me Happi.
Jai. -Shut up.
Sheila. You tell me. -No.
Yes. Jai.
l am Jai, Happi.
Okay. Put down the gun.
-No Happi, he's lying.
They are both in this together.
Fine, if we are together.
Then why don't we go to the
police and decide this?
Fair enough.
He's putting up a charade.
Don't provoke me to shoot you.
Down. Come on.
Hands at your back.
Trust me, you are doing
the wrong thing.
Don't deceive Sally
again. -What?
Don't deceive Sally again.
Jai. Sheila. .
Sorry Sally. .
lt's time for you to
go meet dad, Jai.
lf you wanted to take my place
then why wait until now?
Sheila, shall l tell Jai
everything? -Of course.
Part one, l had to associate
Adit in the plan. .
. .because you need finance
for every plan.
Adit, this is Jeet.
He thought we needed
a scapegoat.
Uncle Sunder was a
greedy bastard.
lt didn't take us long
to convince him.
But that day, when he
thought you were me. .
. .everything was about
to be ruined.
He had to go.
l enjoyed strangling
him to death.
Part two. -Making you
fall in love with me.
And that was very easy.
Whether you believe it or
not, we both think alike.
Kinky.
Part three, l started learning
every thing you did.
The way you eat, the way you
sleep, the way you do everything.
Even the way you breathe.
lt took a lot of effort.
But slowly, Jeet became Jai.
Now there was only one thing
left in the plan.
To replace real Jai.
Everything was going fine.
But one day, suddenly
dad decided. .
.that he'd transfer the entire
wealth, my wealth. .
To your environment company.
We had to change the plan.
Adit stole the blood
pressure tablets.
l went on the boat,
cut the railing.
You know all that.
l hid there and watched
everything.
So that nothing goes wrong now.
Plan came back on track.
And, dad died before he could
transfer the company,
And as if that wasn't
enough our mother. .
. .the pious woman decided to
fulfil our father's last wish.
Jai. -No, Mother.
lt's me, Jeet.
Tell me Jai, is that fair.
l have been wronged, isn't it?
Sweetie, will you help
me with this?
l'll come back.
Goodbye, Brother.
The night, the ambience
The river banks, the
capricious breeze.
No more meeting slyly.
Let's go home now, all right.
l'll go get the champagne.
Jeet!
Jeet.
Don't force me to
kill her, Jeet.
Drop your gun.
Damn it Jai, why don't you die?
l know you have been wronged.
Thank you.
You did enough justice
by saying this.
l want my life back.
l want my life back.
You snatched it from me.
Brother, give me
a chance please.
Please. Listen to me.
Whatever happened in our
childhood, was an accident.
l didn't want to hurt you back
then, nor do l want to today.
Brother, l am on your side.
See, no tricks.
Please.
l have found my brother
after so many years.
l don't want to lose him again.
lt's too late. -lt's not.
The truth will always
remain between us.
And there is no evidence,
Brother.
Just me entering
the photographs.
And no one believes in
it, you know that.
We can live together again.
We can be family.
ust think, Brother.
Jeet, what are you doing?
Put the gun down.
Jeet, shoot him. -Please,
listen to me.
Jeet, shoot him.
Brother, can everything
be fine? -Of course.
We can stay as a family.
-Of course.
Family. Jeet, shoot him.
Brother.
This story didn't have
to end like this.
Brother.
Don't do this to me.
Give me the picture.
Who got the 8x 10?
l need the picture.
Go get the 8x 10.
Who got the picture?
We got the 8x 10.
l got the picture.
We got the 8x 10.
Give me the picture.

Who got the picture?
Go get the 8x 10.
l got the picture.
