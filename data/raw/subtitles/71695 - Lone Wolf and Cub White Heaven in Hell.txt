Lone Wolf and Cub
White Heaven in Hell
According to rumours,
Itto is now an assassin with a child,
living by the ''crossroads to hell''.
lf l might enquire,
why does such a thing concern you,
my lord?
You old fool!
What's wrong with the Yagyu clan?
Why have you still not dealt with Ogami?
Old man, the Yagyu clan are besmirching
the office of Official Executioner!
I'm told that officials of the Shogunate
have discussed a sanctioned manhunt.
A sanctioned manhunt?
If Itto Ogami is declared
a wanted criminal,
all domain lords and their deputies
will be ordered to pursue him.
When that happens,
the reputation of the Yagyu clan
and the office of Executioner
will be in ruins.
My lord, I beg you
not to authorise such an action.
I still have a daughter remaining,
my lord.
She is my youngest daughter, Kaori.
She is stronger
than any of her brothers,
she can destroy Itto for certain.
She will destroy him.
You have my word, my lord!
Still too slow.
How can you expect to defeat Ogami's
Sui-O style techniques like that?
Next.
If you want to avoid
the falling blade,
you must first deal with the others.
If you want to avoid
the other blades,
then beware of the falling one.
Next.
Impressive, Uzuki!
You've deduced the secret
of my falling blade technique!
Match both blades
to the enemy's movements.
React and adjust accordingly.
Visualise the thrown blade
as being directly above your head.
Then simply lure the opponent
into the space you occupy.
Your deaths will not be
without significance.
Forgive me.
Kaori.
Yes, sir.
The only remaining survivors of
the Shadow Yagyu clan are you and I.
You are the Yagyu family's last hope.
You must avenge your brothers.
Slay Itto Ogami
and his only son Daigoro!
I understand, sir.
Farewell, then.
You may go.
Ozunu, the leader
of the Kurokuwa Group,
will escort you to Itto's location.
I've been informed by my men
that Itto Ogami is heading to the capital
along the Sanyo Road.
I see. You are dismissed.
Lady Kaori, allow me to escort you.
I will go alone.
But my informants have already
ascertained Itto's whereabouts.
But can your men kill Itto?
''The wolves headed west.''
''The wolves are crossing eastwards.''
Well, if it isn't Lord Ogami! Welcome.
You are most kind.
This way, please.
Azami...
...I am about to take Daigoro with me
to the very heart of Edo.
Once there, I must slay Retsudo Yagyu
to restore our name.
''The cub is here.''
-Daigoro?
-Over here!
Daigoro?
Let's go home!
Bye!
One and two,
two and three! ! !
Three and four
And bloom like the flower
of the cherry tree! ! !
Beanbags filled with iron filings.
You are?
I am Kaori Yagyu!
You killed my three brothers.
Now I'm the only child
left in the family!
I will take the lives of both you
and your son, Itto Ogami!
Three brothers? Then you must be...
I'm Retsudo's daughter!
Fight!
With that mirror,
my brother Kurando was defeated!
Any choser, and i'll be within
the effective range of her technique!
How...
...could you keep your son
on your shoulders...
...after you'd seen through
my falling blade technique?
How dare you use your own son
to save yourself!
As a father...you are a coward!
We, father and son,
both live at the crossroads to hell.
We exist at the gateway
to the netherworld.
Lady Kaori is dead!
Kaori?
Hyoei!
Hyoei, are you there?
It is I, Retsudo.
Answer me, if you are there.
Your three brothers...
...and your sister...
...were all defeated by Itto Ogami.
Now you are the only one
that remains alive.
If Itto Ogami is not destroyed,
not only the Shogunate
but also the Shadow Yagyu clan...
...will become the laughing stock
of the nation.
All that's left for me now...
...is Hyoei...
You are all I have!
Hyoei, the time has come,
as the new heir
of the Shadow Yagyu clan,
for you to destroy Itto Ogami!
The time has come for you to make
yourself known to the world as my son.
So my siblings, the legitimate heirs
of the Shadow Yagyu chan, are dead!
And now you expect me
to call you my father?
And out of desperation to slay Itto,
you have come to my mountain lair!
How considerate of you!
Hyogo, Kurando, Gunbei and Kaori.
All were highly-skilled swordsmen,
yet all were defeated.
And now you say
I am the only one you can rely on?
You must destroy Itto,
for the sake of the Yagyu clan.
Simply because I was the child
of your concubine,
you abandoned me in the mountains
when I was only five.
Can you imagine how much
that innocent five-year-old child
yearned for a mother and father?
It's remarkable that I'm still alive.
-Hyoei...
-Listen!
The only ones I regard as my parents
are the Spider Demons
of the Kiso-Ontake Mountains!
Hyoei, have you lost
your sense of reason?
I refuse to be called a Yagyu.
The Yagyu clan shall taste
the bitter ashes of ignominy!
Wait!
Hyoei! Won't you wait?
I call upon thee, all the gods who
reside in tranquillity in the heavens.
I pray to thee, almighty gods
who watch over this land.
Three chosen souls were sent
to the afterlife to be purified.
I now beseech you
for the return of their souls.
I pray to thee, almighty gods,
and humbly send you my request.
Reveal yourselves, brave warriors!
Mujo.
Muga.
Mumon.
The three of you were buried
for 42 days.
Through the 42 Days Rite
of the Spider Demon Tribe,
you have been reborn as divine spirits.
Though alive,
you are not mere mortals.
Though dead,
you are not mere corpses.
Our time has come!
As Spider Demon clan members,
we must live to our fullest,
and as samurai, honouring
our Spider Demon principles,
we shall usurp the Yagyu clan
and make our mark on the world.
Destroy Itto Ogami!
The Yagyu clan means nothing to us!
We shall destroy
the Lone Wolf and Cub!
Oh, what an adorable little boy!
Here. See, it's a whistle.
Here you go.
It stretches, it shrinks,
it stretches again!
And it melts in your mouth so softly!
-Yes, please!
-Certainly!
You, too?
How about a sweet for your son, sir?
I'll take one.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.
Here, they taste good.
Thanks.
Won't you come and buy some?
Daigoro!
Wherever the two of you venture,
father and son,
innocent people will die!
Who are you?
The lady troubadour
and the sweet seller,
neither had anything to do with you,
and yet they are dead!
How tragic!
Everywhere the two of you venture,
innocent people such as they
will lose their lives!
Sorry to bother you this late,
but I'd like a room for the night.
Just coming, sir!
Welcome, sir!
You must be tired, I'm sure.
Thank you.
Omatsu, put the cart away.
How adorable!
I'll light the lamp for you.
Come on inside.
There you go.
I'll bring you some food right away.
It won't be much
but please be patient.
Thank you for waiting.
Who's there?
If the two of you request
a room for the night,
or food, or if you request
anything from anyone,
those innocents that you talk to
will die!
How tragic!
No matter where the two of you go,
there will be a bloodbath of carnage
and a tempest of death!
The Spider Demon ''Five Wheels''
technique will strip you
of happiness, anger,
sadness, joy and fear!
The five human emotions
and the five senses will be erased!
A Spider Demon?
We'll take from the two of you
all your happiness and sadness,
all your anger and joy,
leaving you immersed
in nothing but fear!
That is the Spider Demon
''Five Wheels'' technique!
The two of you are nothing
but harbingers of death to begin with!
Step by step,
you will walk the path
of bloody carnage!
Lord Retsudo,
I have a report for you.
Proceed.
I'm afraid that Lord Hyoei is using
unprecedented techniques
to pursue Itto Ogami and his son.
Hyoei is doing what?
It seems that Itto Ogami is finally
starting to show signs of fear.
That dishonest bastard!
-Lord Retsudo...
-Quiet, Ozunu!
What's the matter
with the Kurokuwa clan?
Are you holding back, scared of Hyoei?
Hyoei is a Spider Demon.
I'm afraid that is not
his true afiliation.
The fact is, as surely as your blood
runs through his veins,
he is a true Yagyu heir.
True...
but he rejected my sincere request.
He grew up in the mountains
amidst the birds and beasts,
he grew up in total isolation.
Because of this, the only one
who can influence him is...
-Who?
-Lord Hyoei's younger sister.
Lady Azusa.
Nobody else can possibly do it.
Azusa?
Ozunu, go and find her at once.
Lady Azusa...
...please listen to what I have to say.
This message is on behalf
of your father Lord Retsudo.
You must try to convince Hyoei,
as he will listen only to you.
What is he burying?
Daigoro.
He's a very cautious fellow...
I am a chief advisor of the Zeze clan,
Kyudayu Kenmochi.
I am the assassin ''Lone Wolf and Cub''.
It is way past the time we arranged
in the signs by the road.
I'd like to know the reason
for your tardiness.
I have no excuse for being late, sir,
but due to unforeseen circumstances,
I wish to withdraw my request.
I humbly ask you to accept
50 gold pieces as a cancellation fee.
I know how selfish it is of me
to do this,
but I ask for your understanding.
May I ask the reason?
I believe that it is best for both of us
if I do not reveal that.
Then why did you come?
If the supplicant does not show up,
naturally the request is voided.
As you are the former Official
Shogunate Executioner, Itto Ogami,
an ordinary assassination
isn't worth your time.
Tell me the reason why you wish
to cancel the assignment.
It seems that you would
consider it dutiful to do so.
If you put it like that,
I have no choice.
I wished to keep silent
for your own benefit.
It's the Yagyu clan.
I am aware of the bad blood
between you and the Yagyu clan.
To wrest the position
of Official Executioner from you,
the Shadow Yagyu
arranged to entrap you.
After you fell victim to their ruse,
they say you chose to become
an assassin to get revenge.
But that was until yesterday.
The situation has now changed.
How so?
I'm told that the Yagyu, with many allies,
will soon begin a manhunt.
A manhunt?
In other words,
you'll be declared a wanted criminal,
and the domain lords and deputies
will be ordered to pursue you.
Lord Ogami, you may take my boat.
You can then head north across the lake
and escape beyond the mountains.
When I receive the Yagyu's order,
I'll be forced to go after you as well.
I hope you can see that
what I'm telling you is the truth.
I thank you.
Daigoro...
-What are you doing?
-You have no respect!
No samurai disrespects his sword by
standing on it! It is a part of his soul!
When you arrived,
you sat down wearing your sword.
How do you explain that?
And you've covered your face.
You may be a Zeze clan advisor,
but you do not behave like a samurai!
You're no samurai.
It's obvious that you're a Spider Demon!
Well done, Itto Ogami.
You saw through my deception.
I lied about being an advisor
to the Zeze clan.
I am Hyoei of the Spider Demon clan!
Itto Ogami,
you're about to die a warrior's death
by our Spider Demon swords.
What do you have to say to that?
Is silence your answer?
When a samurai dies,
his name is not forgotten.
That being so, before brandishing
your sword at another,
you should announce your name
and request a duel.
I told you,
I'm Hyoei of the Spider Demons.
Hyoei, a Spider Demon?
That's ridiculous!
To begin with, why would
the Spider Demon clan want me dead?
-You're following Retsudo's orders!
-I know no such Retsudo.
I heard that Retsudo had
an illegitimate son...
...and that he was named Hyoei...
Silence, Itto!
All this talk of fathers and sons
is nonsense!
I, Hyoei, shall destroy you,
and I will force Retsudo to taste
the bitter ashes of ignominy.
Our name shall become renowned
and replace the Yagyu!
He who makes his true name known
when making a challenge
exhibits good manners
in the face of death.
Will you fight honourably
like a samurai
or dishonourably like a ruffian?
Perhaps you'll resort
to your magic tricks to attack me.
Are you that afraid
of my Sui-O techniques?
Speak, Hyoei!
Of course, Spider Demon swordsmen
are nothing but cowards!
What?
How amusing for me to abide
by the code of the samurai,
in order to slay you,
the demon of the crossroads to hell!
If you wish for us
to duel as samurai,
then let us fight honourably.
Be gone! All of you!
Now fight, Itto Ogami!
Very well.
Hyoei Tsuchigumo
of the Spider Demon style.
Itto Ogami of the Sui-O style.
The Spider Demons must replace
the Yagyu clan at all cost,
so the world shall know us
to be true samurai.
You must understand
that every day that I live
at the crossroads of hell...
...is another day
of suffering for me.
I am aware of that.
Like you, there is one matter
that I must settle before I die.
My request is that we part ways
for the time being...
...for we will meet again,
if we both survive.
Very well.
Before I die, I must...
Brother!
What are you doing, brother?
-Bear my child...
-Brother!
Let my child - our child -
lead the Spider Demon clan!
Azusa!
We cannot let Retsudo and
the Yagyu clan have their way!
Our tribe cannot hide
in the mountains forever.
Azusa! Bear my child.
Bear my child for me!
Bear me a son to lead
the Spider Demons!
Brother!
This is my way of showing Retsudo
that I have opposed him
to the very end!
You shall cultivate my seed, Azusa.
Hyoei, have you gone insane?
We two have stepped
into the netherworld of beasts.
Please kill us both.
Father!
What a fool you've been...Hyoei.
You could have finished off Itto Ogami!
However...
...you were a fool!
You requested an honourable duel
as a samurai and lost!
Spider Demon tribesmen,
prepare yourselves!
You're now under my command!
-We refuse.
-What?
Allow us to carry out
our leader Hyoei's command
and slay Itto Ogami on our own.
We never imagined that
he'd lure us into the snow.
If we remain here for much longer,
our techniques will be useless.
It's no use.
We'll freeze to death.
Now!
Indeed...you are terrifying,
Itto Ogami,
for you have defeated the Spider
Demon Five Wheels technique.
How I wish I did not have
to wear this face...
...at least as I lie dying.
How tragic...
What's tragic is your Spider Demon
Five Wheels technique.
I've been waiting for you, Retsudo!
Itto Ogami, I've lost my six children,
six Yagyu heirs, because of you.
I am all that remains.
You're the one who caused it all!
Yet your only son Daigoro
is still alive.
I hope you go insane with loneliness!
This shall be the final reckoning
to avenge all our dead.
I wish the same!
Attack!
Daigoro!
Daigoro!
Lord Retsudo!
Attack!
Take that!
You fool!
Now!
Lord Retsudo, it is best
if we leave now. Please hurry!
Itto...
He may be the ''Lone Wolf and Cub''...
...but one day I will slay him!
Pa!
Daigoro...
The End
