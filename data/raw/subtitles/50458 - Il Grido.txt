THE CRY
I don't know if it's good or
bad news, Mrs. Irma... That's
beside the point...
What news?
Your husband died in Sidney
3 weeks ago...
This letter's from the consulate...
You must be aware,
He was working in a factory.
His things will be forwarded
to you on arrival.
- No, keep them here.
- Why?
I'll be back tomorrow.
...excuse me.
Aldo, Irma's here.
Irma!
Aldo!
Hi! Wait up.
I'll leave your lunch.
Wait, I'll be right down.
Give it to him, please.
- Of course.
- Thank you.
Where's Irma?
She left... anything wrong?
- Why?
- She was crying.
Crying?
I'll be back in 10 minutes, sir...
alright?
Alright.
You come in or not??
- Where's mama?
- I don't know.
Papa, I got a low mark.
Fine...
Have you seen Irma?
No.
I thought she was here.
Why are you home?
Your sister's acting queer today.
Why?
Hello Auntie.
Hi kid.
Tell Irma to stop by my place
later... I'm going home.
Is it true what happened?
And now?
You'll have to tell everything
to Aldo..
You know he's waiting for you?
Why were you crying?
My husband died.
Why didn't you wait to tell me?
I didn't want to... not there.
Now we can discuss it calmly.
Discuss what?
There's nothing to discuss.
We'll get married finally.
Yes, I know
It's not right to be glad when
there's been a misfortune.
But 7 years.
7 years we've been waiting.
Irma...
What is it?
Nothing, Aldo... it'll pass.
Irma.
Irma...
Aldo, there was something else
we should have discussed last
night.
What else?
What else...
Sit down.
We should have discussed it 
long ago.
It's just the one of us has
drifted apart...
You're crazy?
No, Aldo, I'm not crazy.
But if I continue...
... it's just that I've changed,
Aldo.
But I love you
I do love you still,
only not like before.
It's probably my fault.
But I don't think I'm making a
mistake.
... in doing the right thing.
... because I am sincere.
Just suddenly, like that?
Not suddenly.
Then why would you wait?
Because now we have to decide.
Decide? Decide what?
Better I don't say more, Aldo.
Just let me go away.
Go away ?
But where ?
To someone else.
What ?
What did you say ?
You understood me perfectly.
Irma...
Who is it ?
Did you hear ? Who is it ?
Don't ask me that, Aldo.
What good would it do ?
It wouldn't change anything.
But then...
All these years...
Nothing...
Nothing was real.
Everything was true.
Until four months ago.
Maria!
Hello.
Have you seen, at Porto Tolle ?
The dam yielded
and it flooded at Ca' Zuliani.
Let's hope that the alluvia
will do like last time,
wipe away the old
to make place for the new.
- Good day.
- Goodbye.
Now, what will I give to Rosina?
And if you leave ?
Have you forgotten you had a
daughter ?
I thought of that, too.
I should have expected something
like this...
A woman who...
While here husband worked in
Australia for her...
You didn't have any scruples 
about that!
For what it gave me...
And to think...
that I had someone else.
That I could have married.
There's still time...
Elvia's a fine girl.
And me,
what am I to you?
Go ahead, say it... what am I?
I've only one thing to say...
You're not leaving, you stay here.
You're staying here, for better
or worse.
Irma!
I braught you the eggs.
Four.
Five.
And six.
It was six ?
Yes, I think.
Ok, so goodbye.
And thank you.
What are you looking at ?
The envelopes.
Haven't the courage to say
what you think?
Courage ? What courage ?
He's looking for an argument.
Now, even the vegetables are 
delivered.
What we gain in convenience 
we lose in quality.
You also wanted potatoes?
No, thanks.
Thank you.
Why'd you come here?
How so ?
Afraid I'd suddenly disappear ?
Listen, Irma.
With a little good will...
In our case, it is useless.
Try, at least.
Alright, I'll try...
What should I do?
You tell me.
Irma...
Come here.
Let's go in a moment.
That belt in the window last week.
Yes, I still have it.
It was black patent leather with
a gilt buckel.
That one ?
Yes, that's it.
Try it on.
What?
You said you liked it.
You changed your mind ?
Let's see another.
Why throw your money away for
nothing?
For nothing.
For nothing ?
I may pass by again.
See you, Irma.
See you, Aldo.
So everything's suddenly
forgotten, eh?
I've forgotten nothing, Aldo.
It's because I didn't forget 
anything that I prefer to put
an end to it.
It's humiliating for us both.
And I don't want that, Aldo.
I'm so upset I can hardly talk.
What can I do about it?
It's like something I can't
control.
I must see Luigi
He must help me.
Is he home ?
No, I've seen him leave earlier.
Did you talk to Aldo ?
I ran away.
Otherwise, I'd have married him,
I would have done according to
his will.
Don't think about him anymore.
Maybe I shouldn't think only
of myself.
Also's been so good to me these
7 years.
that I begin to have doubts.
About making another mistake.
A man younger than I...
Feelings are not dictated by
reason.
Age doesn't matter.
If you're sure...
For myself, I'm sure.
But is that enough?
Want me to get him?
No, there's too many people.
It's not the right time.
Suppose, instead of dying, Irma's
husband had returned?
What Irma would have done?
I never said anything... but you
did wrong...
Think whatever you like. People
have gossiped... 
They've always gossiped.
And gossip is like hail...
where it falls it stays.
Furthermore...
It's the gossips who see that Irma
is prettier than they are...
... but a pretty woman's one thing,
a bad woman another.
First her husband, then you,
now another...
Too many men for an honest woman!
Now you come to your mother...
What can I do?
You'll have to work it out yourself.
There must be a way
to bring back her feelings.
I know.
He'll keep Rosina, you'll see.
She's as much his as mine,
she has his name.
I'll regret this, too, one day!
Luigi.
He saw me.
- Shall I call him ?
- No, he's with his friends.
Anyway, tomorrow everybody
will know.
I want it to be clear with
Aldo first.
Maria.
Aldo's going crazy looking for
Irma.
Ok, thanks.
Bye.
It was Maria, you heard ?
He'll come here, too.
I'll handle d'Aldo.
You watch out for Luigi.
Keep Luigi here.
Or something terrible will happen.
Irma...
Not to go would be a mistake.
Now, come home.
You heard me?
Now, Aldo, it's really finished!
See how nice the town looks, 
Goriano.
As if everyone there was happy.
Rosina ?
Rosina, wake up.
Wake up.
Come on.
Look !
Edera !
Edera !
- Edera, bring me a rag.
- Come and get it.
The motor-boat broke down.
What motor-boat ?
Papa, I'm staying here to watch.
Elvia, they want a rag.
- A rag ?
- Any kind.
Aldo!
Hi, Aldo.
The living always meet again, eh?
I hope it's not too
unpleasant a surprise.
- How are you ?
- Fine.
Well, not too bad.
We work, we live.
And you ?
So-so.
I wanted to see you.
And, since I was passing by...
Edera ? You were this high
when I saw you last!
And you were like this...
Here.
Staying ?
I don't know.
Stay and eat with us.
Alright...
Everything's still the same here.
Even you, you haven't changed.
A bit thinner, maybe.
Maybe you feel better that way?
- No, I'm not married.
- I know.
Do stay and eat with us... Help
prepare the table. Are you alone?
- No, Rosina's with me.
- Rosina ?
My little daughter.
Didn't you know?
She's so big!
How quickly time flies!
What brought you to
Pontelagoscuro ?
I already asked.
I left Goriano.
I don't live anywhere.
It's better like this.
I don't like being tied down.
You have a screwdriver?
Yes, in the drawer.
Five guys from Ferrara
are placed bets on the boats.
We're going to race today.
A race?
Yes, if we get ours fixed in time.
Motor trouble?
I don't know what it is.
And the pilot?
He knows even less.
- May I see?
- You're a mechanic?
Mechanic?.. Best in the world!
- Shall we?
- Yes.
I'll come along and meet your
daughter.
Thank you!
What makes all that foam?
The propeller.
Makes me thirsty.
We'll go drink and eat something.
Ok.
Also, what about your job?
I'll find another.
There are sugar refineries
here, too.
And they may need me.
Come on!
He's third.
But he's gaining.
You seen that?
Let's bet that he win?
If 19 win,
tonight, you take me dancing.
At the dancing Azzuro ?
No, there's a mill there now...
But there's a new one in town.
It's a bet.
Elvia...
He's still third.
It's because of the motor.
No, it's his driving.
- Come under my umbrella.
- Bad weather !
Rosina !
Let's see up there. Come.
My shoe!
Come.
Let's go together?
I want to go alone,
there's no danger.
Of course there is.
We'll see.
Papa, what is it, this car?
What do you care?
Come on!
This year, winter never end.
She's nice, isn't she?
Look at my sister.
I thought we agreed.
I do what I want.
Why you do that?
Rosina,
Want a chocolate or a caramel?
Both.
And you?
Rosina, come.
Sit down and keep quiet.
You're Elvia ?
Yes.
I'm Irma.
I've hear alot about you.
But to meet you in those
conditions...
In those conditions?
Aldo et I are going through a
crissi..
We've seperated.
It was my fault.
Aldo was furious, he took our
little girl.
I thought he came here 
Why here ?
He'll come, sooner or later.
Why?
You've know each other for a 
long time.
Aldo's often spoken well of you.
I'm persuaded that...
May I leave this valise ?
There's some of his things...
...and Rosina's.
To take her like that...
Tho' I can understand his reasons.
She'll be a burden to him...
Don't you agree?
Not if you say it was all your
fault.
May I leave it ?
Over there.
I'm sure Aldo loves you very much.
To put an end to such a relationship.
You'll regret throwing that away.
Maybe.
Hello, Elvia.
You work Sunday, too?
What else is there to do under
this weather?
How about a movie?
Now?
No, I don't feel like it.
Then tonight? We go dancing?
Tonight, I can't. Next Sunday,
perhaps.
You already said that last Sunday.
Five ribbons, please.
One, two, three,
four and five.
Thanks.
Elvia !
Let's give them to Edera, she has
lots, that way she'll be elected Miss.
There she is.
Thanks.
Look how many he have ?
One, two...
He have 5, 15 already.
Why don't we leave ?
Just as the fun's starting?
I've something to tell you.
What is it?
Edera.
You're staying ?
She can stay.
Aldo...
During all those years,
Was there ever a moment when...
you thought of me?
Certainly.
Parce que tu étais curieux de savoir
if I could live without you.
Is that what you wanted to tell me?
First, I want you to know that...
it hasn't been easy for me.
I'm sorry.
Then why'd you come back?
If Irma kept you
you never would have come.
Yes, that's true... but...
Tell me what you want of me
then please go away
As soon as possible.
I don't really know what I want
of you.
I just wanted some peace of mind.
And you're the only one with whom
I can stay.
Irma sent a valise with
your clothes.
What did she send?
That's all that worries her?
Throw them in the river!
She didn't come herself, eh?
No.
Now,
We better go back home.
But where is this light?
Ah, it's you?
Did you know I won the contest?
And you helped me the most!
What nonsense, eh?
How my head's spinning.
They made me drink.
Some jerk told me I smell like
a flower.
Come on, time for bed.
Is it true I'm like a flower?
Is it?
Trying to get rid of me?
I was elected Miss.
Go to bed, go.
Irma...
Same measurements
or longer?
A little longer.
And less grinding.
Understood.
He left this morning.
We only talked a few minutes.
What did he say?
Nothing.
Just that he was leaving.
But why ?
I didn't ask him.
So you sure it will be
ready for Wednesday.
Yes, absolutely sure.
Ok, thanks, goodbye.
Goodbye.
Are you sorry he's gone?
yes.
I'll give you a job for your
kid's sake.
It's up to you.
Are there any lodgins around here?
None at all.
I could certainly use 1500 
lire a day.
But how'll I manage with her?
It's impossible!
- Impossible.
- I don't know what to say.
It's a pity, thanks, goodbye.
Welcome.
Want more ?
Go to hell !
I told you to be careful crossing
streets...
You must be careful, understand ?
Stupid.
Shoot !
Rosina !
Why are you crying ? They won't 
harm you. They're quite gentle.
Don't fear, they are inoffensive.
Luigi, Francesco, Osvaldo,
let's go.
Come, Francesco, we're leaving.
Don't cry.
They're all really gentle.
Come on, don't cry, Rosina.
Don't cry.
Dry those tears.
There, there.
Papa, are we going there ?
No, cities are too expensive.
We'll find a small town.
So you can go back to school.
But look at your dress...
just look...
Didn't you bring another?
Yes, but I forgot.
Remember, tomorrow.
It's my pretty dress.
When mama comes,
she'll make me an apron, too.
He ran over my cloud.
Get out, police ahead, I'm
not supposed to give lifts.
Pick you up tomorrow.
Alright.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Virginia !
Everybody's dead.
The old fellow's run off again.
I'm fed up, you understand?
Fed up!
Aren't you confortable here?
You've got your bed, your radio.
What do you want?
You can't sleep outside, papa!
It's getting cold... look...
I'm all soaked...
Go in... I'll be right back.
- I'm coming.
- Alright.
Last night I fined a woman-driver.
She was in a nightgown,
you could see everything!
And you fined here, stupid ?
You heard that ?
It's bad for him,
but he drives me crazy.
Regular or super?
I'm super enough around here.
She's telling me!
- Still drinking?
- Until the last drop.
And then?
Then... long live Jesus!
Too many cops around... pick
you up tomorrow.
See you.
It's bed-time, boys!
In God's ear!
Is the town nearby?
What town?
I don't know... any town...
Look... can I stay here a while?
I'm not the boss here.
Virginia!
He wants to stay a while.
It's easier to get a lift here.
with so many trucks passing.
So are you staying or going 
to town?
Oh no...
- How much?
- Fill her up.
Can I see a road-map?
How do I get on the highway?
Where are you going?
To Bologna.
Where's Roma?
Further south.
There... off the map?
There.
What are those stains?
Mountains.
I never saw mountains.
- Ah?
- I never go out.
Am I dumb!
The pressure gauge is broken.
You were not too smart.
If you wanted to go to town, I
could have fixed it with the cops.
Have I known...
- How much?
- 1400 lire.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Don't worry.
Sooner or later, you'll get a
lift... it's a long day.
But I can't arrive at night in
a town.
I've got to eat, sleep...
and I've a little girl with me.
She's yours?
Why's she with you?
What kind of place are you
used to?
"Used to"? You can imagine...
That's not the point.
I've been wandering for 3 months.
Then see if that shack
there will do.
If that's ok...
Open up, please.
In a moment.
Sorry, but someone wants
Number 40.
Number 40?
Number 40 oil...
It must be here.
See what a life!
No rest.
Goodbye.
How is it? Cold, eh?
Rather, yes.
It's better in the house.
I should have put you up with
my father.
You father?
What did you think... in my bedroom?
Aren't you the sly one!
You called me stupid before.
When? Ah yes.
Well, what have you decided?
Are you leaving tomorrow morning?
It depends on many things:
Money, willingness and a job...
What do you have least of?
Willingness.
Good night.
Well, did you decide ?
You could've come in the kitchen.
You wouldn't have disturbed me.
Thanks, but I'm waiting for a truck.
You're in such a hurry ?
That's beside the point.
But what'll I do here?
Where will you go ?
I don't know. Lereo, maybe.
I heard they need laborers.
But any place would do.
I get it.
Two liters.
- How much ?
- 350 lire.
No, ma'me. This much.
Hooligan.
Crook!
Bastard!
That...!
Did you see what he did?
I know that kind.
What'd he do?
Police!... Where's the police?
They're always here when you
don't need them! Always horsing
around here.
Hey, wait... stop!
Let's go, step on it.
Papa, how old is mama?
- What?
- How old are you?
Come on, Rosina...
So, chief?
- How much?
- 10.
Thanks, Carlo.
- When do we see each other?
- When it will be worth it.
I even accepted his apology.
I'm really too nice.
A car stopped, I sold 10 liters
regular gas.
1420 lire.
You found a job quick, eh?
Like it?
We're waiting.
Never mind.
I have another.
It's got a neck, no head, two
arms and no legs... 
- What is it?
- What?
It had a neck, but no head, two
arms, but no legs.
You have to guess.
No legs?
It's a shirt!
You didn't find it.
A shirt?
I didn't understand.
Yes, a shirt have a neck,
but no head.
The head is yours.
Of course!
My head is mine.
I'm telling you a joke?
I'm listening.
A little boy
tell his grandpa...
Rosina, it's late. Let's go to bed.
Good night.
No more tonight! 
Go to bed!
Go to bed!
Five regular.
What time is it?
7h30.
My, I'm late.
I'm going back in.
If she wakes up...
I just looked, she's sound asleep.
For once you can relax
like a gentleman...
Bums! Hoodlums!
Cutting down a healthy tree!
We'll plant another, OK?
No, one tree isn't another tree!
But what do you want?
We bought your land...
the barn, the animals, the trees.
And gave you a roll of thousand lire
notes like this.
Now leave us alone and go home!
That's enough, now!
You're pushing it,
you'll see!
Were the trees yours?
All of them.
Why aren't they, anymore?
My daughter didn't like being
a farmer.
Since my husband died, I've
needed help...
How could a woman run a farm
without help?
So when we were offered a gas
station franchise here... We took it.
But I'd like to travel and see people
and places... like you do.
You see beautiful places and people.
There are lots of ways one can
get around.
Mine's only one way...
I suppose so.
But imagine, I've never been 
anywhere.
You never even saw a mountain?
How do you know?
I know.
Virginia!
Wait here.
Virginia!
If it's the last thing I do, I'll
incapacitate him.
- What is it?
- He came with a little girl.
Started insulting us and threw
stones.
He's got to stop it!
- Don't get excited.
- Yes!
Carry on alone then.
A little girl? Where is she?
At my place.
You said she was asleep.
Aldo...
Fill it up, please. Super.
Pardon, is there a lady's room?
A lady's room.
Thanks.
"Dynamite the large domains"
"And the royal palaces"
"Stab the coward bourgeois"
"Stab the coward bourgeois"
"That leave us starving"
A nice picture for your kitchen, lady?
A landscape, the Mona Lisa, a
scene from "Othello"..?
Something for the bedroom.
Just the thing... a beauty!
- How much?
- 350.
Too much.
Too much for "The Buttefly"?
Alright, here. 300 and 50.
Look Virginia, this pump...
Oh,-the pump!
What do I care about it?
What did you buy?
I bought
a picture.
You bet that...
What are you doing? Careful!
There, I was sure.
You happy now ?
Slowly.
It can't go on.
He keeps running off...
Picking fights...
Upsetting everyone.
It's as if he was a kid again,
that's all we needed.
He behaves only when he's drunk
and drinking's bad for him.
Now even drinking doesn't quiet him!
Let's not exaggerate.
Today he wrenched a foot, tomorrow
it'll be his spine.
He'll paralyze himself!
He needs a private nurse...
No, I'm right... there's nothing
else to do.
It's your decision to make.
I've already decided...
As soon as he can walk...
G-damn it all !
Rosina, to bed, you too.
Right now.
Straighten up!
Don't make a fuss.
Aldo.
Morning.
We just fill out these forms
and pay.
... and let's go or I'll start
feeling bad.
Rosina.
Some blue plate, eh?
Where you going like that ?
Going our way, babe?
Leave me be.
Say!
Leave him alone.
Leave him !
Aldo !
- Where's Rosina ?
- I don't know.
Couldn't you keep an eye on her?
I can't even take care of my father!
I'll go look for her...
You should have left her home.
Come.
Aldo, don't upset yourself,
she couldn't have understood.
I didn't at her age.
...and I slept with my father and
mother... in the same room...
Aldo, tell me if you're angry
with me?
It's not my fault.
I told you to leave her home.
I knew something would happen.
And it had to be this...
Irma...
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Also, the food's ready...
call Rosina.
Why don't you call her?
If she's hungry, she'll come.
Also, this can't go on.
We must put her someplace, too.
I know, Virginia,
I must do something about it.
When will you come ?
I don't know, Rosina.
Rosina, I won't forget you.
Don't tell mama anything about
your Daddy.
Because I'll come back.
Rosina,I can't explain why you
can't be with me now...
Why I don't feel like working 
anymore, but it'll change.
Papa loves you, Rosina.
He'll always love you.
Gualtiero !
We caught two porcupines.
Gualtiero !
- What?
- Two porcupines.
They're very good roasted.
We'll skin them,
and let's have 'em for dinner.
Let Gualtiero do it.
Let's go.
Mario, look what we bring back.
Excuse me.
- You the boss ?
- Why ?
Do you need a mechanic ?
A mechanic ?
You'd think it impossible
For an animal so small to
be so tough...
Imagine, a hippopotamus steak,
From an animal that weighs 3 tons...
...is as tender as butter.
You're ate some?
I had it in Kenya, before the war.
In Venezuela,
I once had iguana...
You went there ?
How they make a living ?
How they make a living ?
Say, who swiped my matches?
His matches?
Here.
The iguana is a kind of crocodile,
although not really a crocodile...
There was a river where I landed.
As I approached the river,
infront of a tree,
in the water,
what looked like six motorcycle
lights.
coming toward me.
Do you know what they were ?
Three iguanas.
So I said to myself :
"It's over
"you've had enough of Venezuela."
So I went to Chile.
Ah, those Chilean women!
When you mix Indians and Germans!
Oh boy.
Weren't you ever homesick?
Homesick my eye! Drink up.
Tomorrow you may be dead!
God forbid.
Salute.
Santé.
But tell me.
If a good mechanic went there...
How'd you earn money?
Licking boots, my boy, licking
boots.
Señor, mister, monsieur...
Seven years of crawling, that's
what the dredge outside cost me.
How'd you get here?
I got a lift... hello everybody.
Good, want a drink?
What is it? Red wine? No...
I don't like that.
Cigarette, then?
Cigarette for Andreina, boys.
And don't you be a jerk.
No, no, it gives it a bad taste.
Aldo...
Off we go ?
Ciao.
Have fun.
It tells you here what you need.
Papers, working contracts...
Everything.
Look, there's even a map.
Say, Venezuela's a big country,
isn't it?

You there, help me, will you?
It must be higher or it can't be seen.
Let me.
I'm going to bust.
I feel it.
Where have I seen you?
Ah, yes !
With those guys working the dredge.
A week ago.
So you're the one ?
Better cover up, you're shaking.
Leave me alone! What did you become
- a nurse?
You must think of yourself.
I can't think of anything...
I'm thirsty.
Where are you going ?
To put up the signal for the doctor.
My God, Andreina !
How you look?
Look at your eyes and...
That skin!
Yellow as a lemon.
How dried-up you look!
My mother was right.
One shouldn't live alone!
Don't think about your mother,
you're ill
you shouldn't be on your feet.
That's what feet are for...
don't be stupid.
You're the patient ?
No, she is...
Honored !
What do you have ?
I've got fever.
- De la diarrhea ?
- No.
Sore throat?
Headache ? Vomit ?
Wouldn't it be better to examine her?
I'll stop by tomorrow... it's only
malaria... take quinine.
Come down... now!
I've calls.
And what is this.
Careful.
What you doing ?
You won't get away with this, young
man...
I'll teach you your place!
How?
How? I'll report you to the police.
Come here.
We'll think of something jolly.
Do you ever ?
Sometime.
After I've had some white wine.
I'll get the flag...
Leave it where it is.
In the army, they taught me flags
are taken down at night.
- Andreina !
- What ?
The police.
That bastard doctor...
What a greeting!
I'd hoped for something better.
What you doing here ?
I came to see you.
What for?
Just felt like it.
Who told you I was here?
That place isn't as big as Texas, 
you know!
Did the police bother you ?
What police ?
Oh, those two... they were just
passing by.
They weren't after you... relax.
Shall we go?
Where at?
To my place... it's better than here.
I'm fine here.
Here?
Darn it all!
I can't understand why things
are so bad in these parts!
You're feeling better, I see.
Not bad, thanks...
Say, what kind of fish is that?
Glit-head... want some?
I never liked glit-head but
I'm hungry.
Come on, Aldo, let's eat.
And then, you better leave.
Me? No, I'm staying with you.
And where will you sleep here ?
I can't find a bed ?
Do you always do this ?
No, in summer women can find work.
Threshing, cutting hemp...
What happens to your money ?
Oh, it's safe enough.. it's in
circulation.
Aldo, look how lovely.
Say, I've known some odd types.
but never a guy as sad as you.
I didn't used to be.
I remember once in Ferrara, we
were setting up a refinery...
With my friends...
Ever been to Ferrara?
I was suppose to go with my cousin.
Well, one Sunday,
some friends came...
All men ?
No, some women, too.
They wanted to go dancing as usual.
There was one... 
her name was Irma...
"Always dancing!" she said. "Let's
go there instead"
And so we two.
We went to a museum.
So?
Nothing. We saw the museum.
What kind of a story is that ?
What's the end ?
I don't understand you.
That's it
You can drive a person nuts!
First you ramble on, then clam up...
Whatever's convenient for you...
If you're like that at work.
Well, work's not there for your
convenience, my pet...
Not at all?
At the refinery,
I had a steady job,
with responsibilities.
From the refinery tower
I could see my house, the river...
My daughter
returning from school
and playing in the courtyard.
You have a daughter ?
Rosina.
As soon as I've some free time,
I'd like a daughter, too.
I was pregnant once...
but it went wrong...
It was too good to be true...
I'd have been married...
with a man of my own...
Somewhere...
"In this grocery store,
"Who doesn't pay, gets turned away."
And you, who knows you?
You don't because you're the
sedentary type.
What am I?
"In this grocery store,
Who doesn't pay, gets turned away."
Then we'll fast.
You know what?
I'm through... I'm going back to
my brother in Contarina.
He'll be mad as hell, but what
am I doing here anyway?
The water's rising... in two days
everything will be under.
Stay, if you like
And keep an eye on my shack.
Always something missing....
Now that I have a roof on my head,
I have no food to eat.
What would you do without me?
I'd wait for good weather.
And then?
Look here.
Are you trying to give me advice ?
How old are you ?
80.
Well, I'm 90.
Let's do something.
Let's do nothing!
I see, now.
Nothing will happen
unless I arrange it...
Where are you going? It's raining!
I'm going for a walk...
Be seeing you!
Andreina!
Andreina !
Andreina !
- What do you want ?
- Come back.
No, I won't... let me go.
Andreina, come back !
Stop shouting! Why should I
come back?
Don't you know why I came here?
Because I'm hungry... hungry!
And you're hungry too.
And if you say you're not, you're
lying.
I've had rotten luck.
But who do you think you are?
You've got troubles, alright...
It would take a month to tell
you all mine!
Where are you going ?
Wait !
Let's talk it over, can't we.
Where are you going ?
You go to hell!
Cold, eh ?
50 liters, Miss.
I swear, no more night service
in winter!
Still looking for work, eh ?
Or other things ?
Aren't you fed up ?
I'm more than fed up, alright,
Virginia.
You left your valise here...
I don't know if you remember.
Where is it ?
In my father's room.
You returned ?
Just passing through.
I thought you were...
Attaboy, grandpa.
You're alright!
A postcard came for you.
A card ?
I kept it a while.
It was from Irma.
Where is this card.
It said nothing important...
I mislaid it.
How come you lost it ?
It said Rosina was well... 
She'd grown... best wished,
the usuals.
Nothing else?
Yes, there was something else
but I forgot.
You forgot? But I must know!
Halt!
You can't go this way.
Why not ?
Orders.
But I must go to Goriano.
I can't do anything.
And that way ?
Its authorized.
Thank you.
Citizens! Landowners
Threatened by Disposses Notices.
Today, at 15h,
Big Protest Meeting
at Community Center.
Aldo!
I won't ask how you do or what
you doing here,
we're having a meeting...
They're expropriating everything
here...
to build a jet-plane air-field.
Why they need jets right here,
I don't know..
I really don't know.
But they're going ahead.
Only it won't end this way.
Because after the meeting
we're seeing the Prefect.
Guido, I'm going that way.
Ok. ciao.
Rinaldi !
À vos ordres.
Stop ! Where you going ?
He's coming !
Isn't that Aldo ?
Yes.
When did he get back ?
I don't know.
They've set fire to the fields !
The fields !
They're burning everything.
- Bianca.
- Aldo !
- Have you seen Irma ?
- She was just here.
I'd like to know one thing.
Why are you worrying about the
farmers ?
They're better off than you are...
They're all landowners...
So what if they lose a piece
of land?
It's for the country's defense, no ?
Maybe so, but you can't talk
away the people's solidarity!
Mama !
Anna...
Anna, I'm going out a moment.
Put him to bed right away.
Dry him well first...
Aldo !
