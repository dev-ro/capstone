Between the late 18th century
and throughout the 19th century
there were a series of
conflicts in Europe
many of which had a
common denominator:
tensions between the
old and new regime.
This story is based on actual
events and characters.
This world is constantly changing.
It is unstoppable.
Sometimes, however,
it seems unchanging
before our eyes.
It is nothing more
than a mirage.
Under that surface, it is
continuously changing.
My brother Miguel Joaquin and I
lived in the same changing world,
but we dealt with it in
very different ways.
The years went by and Joaquin
was the first to die.
Later, our father died.
Since there was little
room in Altzo cemetery,
I would have to remove my
younger brother's bones...
to make room for our
father's remains.
What?
There's nothing.
The grave was empty.
My brother's bones
had vanished...
As if that changing world
had swallowed them up.
CHAPTER 1: MARTIN'S EXILE
Where's Maria?
What?
Is she coming?
Don't know.
Why?
Just curious.
Look!
A wolf cub.
Where are you going?
Don't!
Watch out, Martin.
The mother must be nearby.
Martin...
Well, I'm off.
Thanks.
Wolves.
They'll be down from
the mountain...
looking for men.
That's bad news.
Maria...
Stop looking out the
window, come back to work.
Soldiers.
Traditionalists, I think.
Quick, let's go!
Quick!
First the meat, then the rest.
They're getting close!
Joaquin!
Martin!
Come down here!
I need them for
work on the farm.
Otherwise, we'll
starve to death.
All you farmers say the same.
You all support the charters,
but when it comes to fighting,
no one wants to do his bit.
You'd rather others did it.
Why defend all of this
if there are no men
to maintain it later?
We'll take one of them.
You choose.
Joaquin, you stay.
Why me?
What are you saying?
Joaquin stays, I said.
Why do I have to go?
You heard. One of you has to go.
But why me? - Because I said so!
All right, we'll
take the other one.
I don't want more
problems on the front.
Wait, wait...
No.
I'll go.
Don't worry...
I'll be back soon.
And when I do, we'll
both run the farm.
All right?
Father won't always be around.
Well done!
Take anything you
want from them.
He's from Altzo.
Nieves, the girl from Oiarbide,
has been secretly seeing
Jacinto from Arretxe.
All of Altzo found out
before her husband did.
Imaz the bard is writing a
musical verse for them.
God, he doesn't waste much time.
What else?
I suppose you already know...
Your brother Joaquin
is with Maria.
I didn't know a thing.
Oh... Well, they're courting.
Seems serious. Some say
they hear wedding bells.
What?
I thought you'd know.
We're doing well.
But much remains to be
done to win the war.
We still run the risk
of losing our rights.
As we have been winning
battles lately...
the general has decided
to grant home leave.
Two weeks to join your families
and help with the harvest.
Antonio, is Joaquin at home?
Yes, he's there.
How many nights will
you be staying?
Ten and four nights, I think.
BILBAO
Everyone getting on with
their lives and we're here.
Hey, Fernando...
Do you understand what the
hell we're doing here?
What do you mean?
What are we fighting for?
I'll be honest with you,
I couldn't care less
about all this.
When this is over,
I'm going away.
Where to?
America.
America?
I can't move my arm.
Don't worry, you will.
And what if I don't?
The war is over.
It's time to go home.
CHAPTER 2: MARTIN AND THE GIANT
THREE YEARS LATER
40 if they can't!
40 if they can't!
40 if they can't!
41 if they can!
42 and a half if they can't!
That's the one.
42 and a half if they can!
I won.
Give me work and I'll
forget your debt.
What?
If you give me work
you owe me nothing.
Don't beat about
the bush, do you?
I don't need you.
Next.
Where would he be from?
From Altzo?
Must be huge.
And strong. - Very strong.
Anyone there?
Isn't that Martin from Ipintza-zahar?
- Yes, it's him.
Wasn't he dead?
Martin, from Ipintza-zahar.
Father, father!
Your brother is here.
Is it easy to eat
with just one arm?
It is now.
I got used to it.
Why didn't you come
home until now?
The war has been over
for three years.
I had a lot of things to do...
Can I have a bit more?
Not much left.
If you plan to stay, you'll
have to pull your weight.
I won't be staying.
With one arm, I won't be
much use on the farm.
I heard about a business
opportunity in America.
But I need money for the boat.
Look, I don't know what
you expected to find,
but there's no money here.
Can't you give me an advance?
Not a lot...
I said there's no money.
Please, father. - No!
Joaquin! Don't start!
Pick it up!
What are you doing?
You said we'd run this
between the two of us.
Me? I said that?
Yes! Yes, you said it!
Leave him alone!
I'll be back and we'll
run the farm between us.
I was waiting for you!
Things change, Joaquin!
Why?
Why would they change?
You must have changed!
I carried on here.
Same as before.
Evening, Antonio.
What brings you here?
This is for you, as a
sign of good will.
We didn't have meat this year...
Why this now?
My son Martin is back.
Really? He's alive?
That's great news!
He can help you on the farm.
He can't move his right arm,
so he won't be much use.
He's asked me for some
money to go to America.
Keep me out of this...
I'm not asking for money.
I just want you to spare
me part of the rent.
That's like asking me for money.
The land is poor,
the soil is dry.
If Martin stays with us it's
one more mouth to feed.
Lord, Antonio, this will make
me look like a scoundrel.
I'm not the one avoiding
paying the rent.
I know, you're right, but...
We'll pay for losing the war.
They've already put up taxes
and they'll go up more.
If you don't pay me as agreed,
I can't pay my taxes.
Then two families will
be damned, not one.
Sorry, Antonio.
I'm sure you'll make a
go of it with the farm.
Go on, pick that up, bring
it with the rest next month.
Good bye.
The gentleman talking to father
is Jose Antonio Arzadun.
He's an impresario.
What's he doing here?
He's telling him we can
earn lots of money.
If we put you on show.
Put me on show?
To show...
what you're like.
Let me explain it to you...
No! Why put me on show?
Because you're big.
Huge. Let's be honest.
You should have seen them
staring at your clogs.
Shut up!
I know how you all laugh at me.
What are you on about!
No one is laughing at you.
Oh, no? In Tolosa,
as it happens!
We all have to do
things we don't like.
Stop it! Leave me alone!
Carry on like that and you'll
end up like the Sarasuas.
Meaning?
What do you think? Think they
knew they'd lose the farm?
End up begging? Go and ask them!
See what they say.
You and me can't
run this farm...
But we can run this business.
Father won't agree.
Until Arzadun tells him
how much we can make.
Pay to see a tall lad?
People are willing to pay for
something they've never seen.
The world is going mad.
2.24 metres!
Three centimetres taller.
He just keeps growing.
Going already?
Yes, to Bilbao.
Right now it's just a test.
If it works out, we'll
put on more shows.
Good luck, then.
We'll see.
Let's go, Martin.
Yes, all right.
We'll be back in a week.
Goodbye.
BILBAO
We'll walk.
Slowly, but without stopping.
He's nervous.
He hasn't been out for a year and
a half unless it's in Altzo.
They'll laugh at me.
Don't worry, Joaquin.
You'll get used to it.
People adapt to everything.
It's always that way.
Come on, Joaquin.
Come on.
MADRID
Mr. Colossus.
Good afternoon.
Mr. Colossus?
Are you there?
I'll talk to him
in his language.
Mr. Colossus, are you there?
Here... I am...
Are you ready?
Mr. Colossus will now
stretch out his arms
so that you can see how
tall he is compared to you.
Up you come, walk under them.
You try it, too!
That frock coat?
Excuse me?
That. Where you buy it?
This? A tailor made it
for me on Arenal Street.
Arenal? - Yes.
It nice.
"This huge man,
who has been with us
for several weeks,
is able to ingist 20
litres of cider a day."
"Ingist"
What does it mean?
Ingest.
To drink.
Looks good.
People will love it.
Forget it!
I'm not wearing an Isabelino
soldier's uniform!
You're in Madrid.
Do you want to dress
as a Carlist?
If they find out back home...
Don't worry about that.
Look at this.
You're in the newspaper.
There's a drawing of you.
What is this?
It doesn't look like me!
They don't even come
up to my knees!
That's not a problem.
All they do is lie.
Let people imagine it.
You're here...
but out there your legend is
spreading by word of mouth.
Growing even more than you are.
Until next Sunday.
- May God be with you.
Please!
Don't forget to lock the door.
We'll be back at nightfall.
You look very smart, Martin.
Oh... Thank you...
Do you think so?
You don't look like yourself.
All right, farewell.
Goodbye.
Walk underneath
and see the distance
between your heads
and the enormous arms of
this marvellous being.
See
how your heads are well below
the arms of the Colossus.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Yes, sir?
This circus act is
all well and good,
but when we hired you our aim was to
look into other aspects of gigantism
from a medical or even
psychological point of view.
Very well.
And what do you suggest?
I suggest a question
and answer format.
All right.
Go ahead.
To break the ice, I'd like to ask
the actual giant a question.
I don't know how
to address him...
I don't think "Mr.
Colossus" is acceptable.
What is your name?
Your name.
What I would like to know, Mr.
Eleisegui,
is if you had this disease from when you
were born, or if you contracted it later.
Were you born this way?
No.
No, no.
He was normal until he was 20.
Then he get ill in bed.
Then he grew.
And he go on, and on...
Who might you be?
His brother. Martin.
From your appearance, I thought
you were a new member.
Until I listened to you.
"And he go on, and on..."
Silence, silence please.
You're saying he
doesn't stop growing?
Did you understand my question?
Yes, we understood
you perfectly.
You understood correctly
what Martin said.
Believe it or not,
Miguel Joaquin
continues to grow.
People laugh at me.
Oh, you poor thing!
Yes, but not because you're tall!
They laugh at the way you speak.
Is it my fault I don't
speak Spanish properly?
Learn it!
You've had plenty of time!
Why are you dressed like that?
The Turkish suit or the
Isabelino uniform, yet
you look like you just
came off the farm!
What is wrong with you?
They asked us to dress this way.
It's what they expected to see.
Please make it stop,
please make it stop...
Please make it stop,
please make it stop...
It won't stop...
What won't stop?
I hear my bones.
I hear them growing.
My head aches.
Easy, Joaquin.
Don't worry.
Come. Sit down here.
I try and stop it with
all my strength, but...
I can't do it.
My body doesn't react.
No one can grow forever.
What if it doesn't stop?
I want to go back to Altzo.
What do you want to do in Altzo?
First of all, buy the farm.
Then settle down, have a family.
Do what everyone does.
What happened with Maria?
It was impossible with Maria...
She wasn't the one for me...
I thought she was the
one who left you.
Why would she leave me?
And why would you
want to leave her?
You ask a lot of
questions, don't you?
Remember how they got us mixed
up when we were little?
Yes. - They didn't
know who was who.
CHAPTER 3: JOAQUIN GROWS TALL
Come downstairs. She's
waiting for you.
I see you sent money home.
What?
You've put glass in the windows.
Oh, yes.
I hadn't noticed.
I heard you want
to buy the farm.
Yes. Well...
Joaquin and my father.
Not me.
Why is that?
There aren't many things that
are worth it around here.
Thus, 40% of the house belongs to
Antonio Eleizegi and his son Joaquin.
The rest shall be
paid in installments.
Failure to pay three
installments in a row,
will result in you losing your share
and not recovering the upfront cash.
Agreed?
Yes.
Six centimeters.
Six centimetres more
than the last time!
Good, good!
Long live the Altzo Giant!
Hurrah!
You need to explain
something to us, Joaquin.
Is it true you built the Zuaznabar
Handi wall by yourself?
What?
Nonsense.
Told you so.
Yes you did! I was there, remember?
With those weathered stones.
That's not true.
Good God!
Go away, all of you!
Come here!
We came to see the giant!
Take your nonsense elsewhere!
Why can't I go out?
Arzadun says it might spoil the
shows he's organising here.
Does he understand me?
No, no he doesn't.
Is he backward?
No, he's Basque.
Oh, I see.
Could he say something
to me in Basque?
Naturally, Your Highness.
Say something to the
queen in Basque.
But she won't understand me.
It doesn't matter.
Say something to her.
Whatever you want.
We should never have left Altzo.
People treat me differently now.
I'm not saying that.
Your Majesty, Miguel
Joaquin, the giant of Altzo,
is pleased that...
- Are there many giants there?
Just him.
True. With one hundred like him, you
traditionalists would have won.
Yet you lost the war.
I presume you are
traditionalists?
We are liberals, Your Majesty.
How do you know he's
the tallest in Europe?
There is no evidence
of a taller man.
If Your Highness enjoys
the performance...
it would enable us
to travel abroad...
Are you completely proportioned?
Could he undress for me?
She asked you to undress.
Get undressed!
Careful.
Take my hand.
Mind your head!
Bend down.
Good. You're doing very well.
Bend down, Joaquin!
Hide, Joaquin!
One more step.
Hail Mary...
full of grace...
the Lord is with you...
Don't let them see you.
Careful!
Please make it stop,
please make it stop...
please make it stop...
Ladies and gentlemen!
The world's tallest person!
Did you see this?
It must measure at
least 15 metres.
Who could have put
those stones there?
Here comes the first one.
ENGLAND
Saad, out you get.
Joaquin! Come here!
Saad, Joaquin.
Joaquin, this is Esther.
Esther wishes to meet
people of her height and...
and I told her I know
the nicest of all.
Go on, take a walk together.
Where?
Anywhere.
It's all pretty here.
CHAPTER 4: AMERICA
You won't believe it,
but I heard so
much about Joaquin
that when I saw him I
thought he looked small.
By the way, I just heard.
I didn't know your brother
was off to America.
Who?
Isidro, your brother.
Can I have a word, father?
What is it?
What's this about Isidro
going to America?
Yes, the decision
was made last week.
And why wasn't I told?
You were away working and...
And then with all the
fuss about the wedding...
And you paid for his ticket?
An advance on his inheritance.
The advance I asked
you for at the time.
What are you on about?
You're earning a lot
of money with Joaquin.
But you knew I wanted to leave.
At the time! But things change!
This is your wedding day, this
isn't the time to discuss it.
May I have this dance?
What about if we go
to America, too?
Now?
Yes. Why not?
We're always putting things off.
I don't know...
Just like that...
Trust me. I've been overseas...
and I know you'd be happier
away from the farm.
I'm happy here.
Honestly...
I'm fine here on the farm.
I don't care if there
are a lot of you.
Why do you always find excuses?
Like you don't want to move on!
I didn't say that...
But if we go there and
it is not so easy?
If we were starving here...
That isn't the case.
We're fine... you're
earning money.
My brother isn't badly off,
either, but he's leaving.
When they told me I thought:
it was just what
I always wanted!
Could you write underneath
"Te espanish goliat"?
Written like this.
Good.
"Espanish" what?
The Spanish Goliath.
In English.
Why not the same as always?
"The Guipuzcoan Giant".
I prefer that name.
I want it to say "Handia".
They don't know what
"Guipuzkoan" means in England.
Well I prefer it. "The
Guipuzcoan Giant".
Why don't you look at me?
What?
You never look at me.
You always talk to
Martin or my father...
You never say anything to me.
See? You're doing it again!
Don't look at him! I'm
the one talking to you!
All right, we'll discuss
it some other time.
Some things are going
to change around here.
From now on, no more hiding.
We talked about that, Joaquin.
And I want you to give me
my share of the money.
And you can give
him my share, too.
Please don't move.
BORDEAUX
Keep moving, Joaquin.
LONDON
Sorry, what was that?
Do you mean "Toulouse"?
No, no, Tolosa.
Hello.
Sent the money.
Did you already send yours?
I did it yesterday.
But did you tell him...?
Yes... To "Tolos",
in one installment.
You explained it a
thousand times.
Will you trust me
once and for all?
Notice anything?
Could you not choose a
more discreet place?
Raised insoles.
That way I'm six
centimetres taller.
A few more centimetres won't
make you look taller.
What about with this top hat?
What do you think?
Now what's wrong?
Look, Joaquin...
I've made enough money here. As soon as
we get back, I'm leaving with Maria.
What?
But what will you do in America?
People go to make money, you
already have that here.
I always wanted to go abroad.
And where are you now?
On the farm?
You can change places,
but you will never change.
Meaning?
Not on the farm...
or on trips...
You've never been able
to adapt to anything.
Perhaps I need
something different.
Yes.
Perhaps you need to
be far away from me.
That isn't true.
I've always been here for you.
By your side, helping you.
By my side?
You always want to
run away from me!
But while you've
been making money...
it's bearable.
Everyone has to live their life.
I think it's best
for Maria and I.
Each live his own life?
But you've never been able
to fend for yourself!
You live off me and you'll
go to America thanks to me!
I had to make sacrifices, too.
Please.
You have everything
thanks to me.
Expensive clothes, money
for trips and your wife.
What did we get from you?
Breathe...
Again.
You have gigantism.
Curvature of the spine. You have
to support a lot of weight.
Do you have desires? - What?
Erectile problems? - What?
With your penis.
It can be cured, can't it?
He doesn't know. Headaches,
aching joints...
Common in many cases. Like
in your brother's case.
Have you thought what you will
do with his bones when he dies?
The scientific community would
pay good money to study them.
I'll be buried in Altzo.
How old is Joaquin?
29.
He still has time, doesn't he?
These giants not only
grow on the outside,
their organs also
develop inside,
they grow and age prematurely...
until they die.
Arzadun told me that
Esther is in Paris.
Do you want to meet up?
All right, my friends.
It is important that
you do not move
in the next few minutes.
Otherwise, the image
will be blurred.
Joaquin, please look at Esther.
Comfortable?
As if the world opened its eyes.
The world was blind.
We only knew the
past from hearsay,
but we could not see it.
Now we can.
Reality can be seen.
Reality.
You no like?
Get out!
Halt!
What happen?
Highway robbers.
Take it easy.
Do what they say.
Where did he come from?
Inside the carriage!
Boss!
Boss!
Not bad!
Let's go.
How much money was there?
How much money?
You told me you sent it by post!
Nothing was sent to Altzo?
I was wary.
You were wary?
Do you realise what you've done?
You're not only a
giant, you're a fool!
You lost your money and father's!
Everything!
So tell me.
Now what do we do?
Splendid.
Goodbye.
Don't worry, Martin.
We'll do another tour and get
back everything you earned.
I'm sure.
No, Joaquin.
You've done quite enough.
No.
To work on the railways
you need strong arms.
I'm willing to do it.
Do you honestly see yourself
working with a shovel?
But are there no other jobs?
Yes.
But not here.
What are you doing?
Measuring the child?
Stop it, Martin!
He's growing a lot.
What do you mean?
Can't you see he's all right?
He's much taller
than others his age.
Please, Martin!
If he'd married the giantess...
but I'm not sure about this.
The audience won't be happy. And
that's not good for business.
Why?
People expect to see
a big, strong giant.
And even though
Joaquin is young...
he's worn out.
People imagine
something different.
I don't understand...
You always said that to sell more
tickets, let people imagine.
Now you're telling
me the opposite.
That people imagined too much.
That's how it is.
It's ironic, but
that's how it is.
Decadence is very hard to avoid.
We'll think of something.
Don't take this the
wrong way, but...
business is not
your strong point.
Didn't you all buy the farm?
Why not concentrate on that?
Farming will see better times.
You'll all adapt.
It's always the same.
The ability to adapt
is people's most valuable asset.
Well I believe the opposite.
It's the most wretched
thing we possess.
Come on.
It's going to get cold.
LAST CHAPTER: THE
ONE-ARMED GIANT
There... put it higher.
No posters left in Spanish?
They won't understand
a word in French.
The drawing is what matters.
The drawing? - Yes.
The drawing doesn't give
much away, it's torn!
Don't help me. You
need to keep hidden.
Now.
Now.
What are you doing?
Nothing...
Trying to move my right hand.
But it's no good.
It's useless.
I know what I'm talking about.
I feel guilty, Martin.
Why?
Because we're together.
You and me, alone.
Trying to get ahead
though I know you would have
preferred something else.
Because this is the seventh one.
The seventh outlet.
Eat up, Joaquin.
Seven cutlets. Isn't
that amazing?
You said it would
be like a tribute.
That's why we charged you less.
But it was disgraceful making my brother
dance with the carnival figures.
Here.
Stop here!
I'm getting out here.
Go and announce my arrival.
You can't stay here.
We can't afford to
worry about that.
If they see me, we
won't sell tickets.
All right.
Climb up and rest.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Would you like to see a giant?
If you wish, for
just half a real,
you can see a giant who
measures two and a half metres.
And where is he?
In the forest, nearby. If
you wish, I can bring him.
He can drink 20 litres
of cider a day...
and eat eight cutlets.
Shut up, will you?
Here.
Thank you.
I heard of him. They call
him the Giant of Bilbao.
No.
The Guipuzcoan Giant.
Whatever you say, but
I did hear of him.
He's famous.
I heard that he's very tall,
but that he can't do much
because he has a lame arm.
No!
The giant's arms are
perfectly all right.
Really?
Didn't he lose an arm in the war?
- No.
Where did you hear that?
I don't know. It's
what I was told.
I'm freezing to death.
What happened to you?
Why are you here?
Did you find an audience?
You need it to go to America.
We have to get more money.
We barely have enough for food.
You have to sell me better.
Use all your skills.
Invent something...
Make changes to the show!
I'll do whatever you ask.
Let's go home.
I'm going to freeze to death.
This is the last will and testament
of Miguel Joaquin Eleizegi Arteaga.
All the assets go to his
brother, Juan Martin Eleizegi,
and to the latter's son,
Miguel Maria Eleizegi Zuloaga.
24,000 reales for his brother,
and 15,000 for his nephew.
Did you know Joaquin
had that money?
No.
How could he have so much money?
Now you have enough
to leave here.
Where?
I've become used to this.
Father...
Why did you choose me?
What do you mean?
I mean the war.
They let you choose
between Joaquin and me.
You didn't hesitate.
You decided that I
should go to war.
I didn't choose you.
Yes.
You did.
No.
The traditionalists arrived
and took the eldest son.
This world is constantly changing.
It is unstoppable.
Sometimes, however, it seems
unchanging before our eyes.
It is no more than a mirage.
Under that surface, it is
continuously changing.
Maria.
What?
It moved!
What?
My hand!
My hand moved!
I never moved my hand again.
But I would always maintain I
managed to do it that day.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Not everyone believed me.
Despite not acknowledging it...
sometimes I also doubted
what my own eyes had seen.
It happened right now!
In the village they said
that I exaggerated...
like when I talked about my
adventures with my brother.
The stories that I
told about Joaquin
were more exaggerated
than before...
Far from disappearing...
Joaquin continued
growing deep inside me.
Joaquin's possessions gradually
scattered or disappeared.
Hats, gloves, shoes...
Nothing remained.
The grave needs to be emptied.
There's nothing here.
Joaquin's bones went the same way
as the rest of his belongings.
Some said that the bones were
in a famous British museum.
Others said that Joaquin himself
had sold them to a doctor
to leave money to our
family after his death.
Nothing was proven and Joaquin
's bones never appeared.
There was nothing but
emptiness around.
Just an enormous hole.
And it was myself who
filled that hole.
