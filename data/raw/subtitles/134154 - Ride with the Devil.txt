A little late.
Ain't it so?
[Indistinct Greetings]
Mornin'.
[Preacher]
Giver of all graces,
the author of everlasting light,
send Thy blessing...
upon these, Thy servants...
this man and this woman
whom we bless in Thy name...
that as Isaac and Rebecca
lived faithfully together,
so these persons may surely
perform and keep...
the vow and covenant
between them made.
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here...
[Continues]
What's ticklin' you?
Do you smell
somethin' funny?
Fool. It's the cologne
my ma slapped on me
this mornin'.
...signifying unto us
the mystical union...
What brings you so late
to sister's funeral?
I mean wedding.
My pa had me workin'.
Huh.
Son.
[Preacher]
Let him speak now, or else
forever hold his peace.
(sing)(music)(music) [Fiddle]
[Chattering]
Do you believe all those men
are necessary, Horton?
We can take
no further chances, Asa.
You and I both know
it'll soon be war between us
and the Yankee aggressors.
With that black republican
Abe Lincoln in the White House,
Missouri's no longer safe from
the depredations of Jennison
and his Kansas Jayhawkers.
They've yet to strike
this deep into Missouri,
Horton.
Lawrence, Kansas,
and its abolitionists
are a long way from here.
There are Union men
even here amongst us, Asa.
Schmidt and his Germans formed
a militia at Independence,
and his Lawrence cohorts
have eyes and ears amongst us,
even here.
[Chattering, Laughter]
[Woman]
Good-bye.
[Man]
Take care, now.
I've been thinking, Jack Bull,
a wedding is a peculiar thing.
It's no more peculiar,
Jake, than slavery.
That's certain.
That's why I've often
wondered for what cause
those Northerners...
are so anxious to change
our Southern institutions.
When both North and South,
men are every day enslaved
at the altar,
regardless
of their state or color.
When there's
a type of subjugation,
we should avoid it, Jake.
Happily, my poverty insures
my freedom from such a fate.
Oh, no. Not if my mother
can help it.
I heard her
singin' your praises earlier
to the sister of the groom.
Good day,
Mrs. Chiles, sir.
Father.
Please give our regards
to your father, Jake.
You know he's invited.
He's more comfortable
workin', you know.
You must at the least bring
Mr. Roedel some of the cake.
I will, ma'am.
Thank you.
Guten Morgen.
Guten Morgen.
Guten Morgen, Jakob.
Guten Morgen.
Guten Morgen.
Father, Mrs. Chiles
sends her regards,
a piece of the cake.
You are to see tomorrow
Mrs. Kreitzer.
The war is sure to come now,
with the secession.
Mrs. Kreitzer's husband
will take you in St. Louis.
Pa, I told you,
I'm not gonna huddle with all
the Lincoln-lovin' Germans.
It is safer.
For us, this is no war.
Pa, you may have
bore me in Germany,
but I was raised here.
These are my people.
And if it gets hard...
Your people?
No, Jakob,
this they are not.
You will always be
a deutschman, a German to them,
no matter with who
you are friends.
Promise me you'll go
to Mrs. Kreitzer.

Where is he?
Where is he?
[Man]
I got him! I got him!
[Woman]
No!
Let's go, Asa.
My son's gone.
Where's your boy?
[Gasps]
Jake, my pa.
[Panting]
He told me to run, Jake.
He told me.
Did you see
who they are?
Jayhawkers, Jake.
Lawrence men.
[Woman Screaming]
Father!
Come on! Don't
you die here too.
Find the boy.
Let's go look
in the mill.
[Whooping,

Check the barn.
Find the boy.

Ted. Riders.
Gentlemen,
Captain Henderson, Company D.
You boys have rid
a bit far from home.
Hell, spent two night trackin'
this bushwhacking bastard...
and his Confederate friends.
What are you boys doin'
this far into Missouri?
Just rootin' out rebels
and conscriptin' chickens.
Been through Cass
and Lafayette Counties.
Killed our share.
Not much action
in Lafayette.
We got four Sunday last.
Stretched their necks.
They're still hanging.
Hey, George, fetch
a busthead out there.
So you men were in
on Lafayette?
Yes, sir.
[Sighs]
We were tired of chasin'
these rebs into the bush.
Can't trust
none of these locals.
They're all hiding 'em.
I wish we had
a real army to fight,
not these sneakin' bastards.
Battles and armies...
it's all back east.
Down here in Missouri,
you just have the people
to fight ya.
Ted.
Ted!
- So you were in on Lafayette?
- [Woman Screaming]
- Bushwhackers!
- [Men Grunting]
[Screaming Continues]
Whoo!
[Woman Sobbing]
Doin' business with
the Yankee invaders, huh?
No. They forced me.
[Grunts]
[Woman Screams]
[Woman Sobbing]
He's dead.
You killed him.
Shoot me too, please.
We don't hurt women, ma'am.
[Sobbing Continues]
We took her man.
We should leave her the store.
Come on, Jake.
It's gettin' hot in here.
Enough of this, boys.
Let's load up!
Hyah! Hyah!
[Jake's Voice]
"Dear Mrs. Chiles,
by this letter you will know...
"that I and your son
Jack Bull are living yet.
"We long for news of you,
but our horses' backs
remain our only residence,
"and it is yet too dangerous
to return home.
"Our news is this.
Jack Bull and I at last...
"met with Captain Warren,
the killer of your husband,
"and he and four of his
accomplices breathe no more.
"I know it must be painful
to recall the night your
husband was taken from you,
"but we hope you will find
some comfort in knowing
how our work continues.
"Often we don the Union Blue
to lull the Federals
into a false serenity,
"and the Yanks pay dearly for
their belief in appearances.
"Under the disguise, we wear
our bushwhacker vestments
close to our hearts.
"They may not be regular
army uniforms,
"as there is no Southern army
out here for us to join,
but where we find
true Missouri men,
we make our own army."
Black John!
[Chuckles]
George Clyde.
Whoa!
[Jake Continues]
"If you should happen
upon my father,
"kindly express to him
my truest regards.
"He will not accept news
from me directly, as he
disapproves of our cause.
"Please tell him, though,
that in my disobedience to him,
"I still obey the call to honor
he himself taught me.
"With warmest love
from me and from your son,
Yours Sincerely,
Jakob Roedel."
Always loved ridin'
with George Clyde.
He makes Yankee killin'
as entertainin' a pastime
as greasin' ganders.
Whose guns are those?
You mean Holt over there.
You'll get used to him.
That's Holt.
That's George Clyde's
pet nigger.
Don't call him that
in front of George, though.
George don't like that.
He carries those?
Yeah. He's
a damn fine scout.
When George
tosses him a gun,
a good Yankee killer too.
Him and Clyde
growed up together.
When Jim Wayne's boys
come for Clyde, Holt sent
three of them to heaven,
so he rides with us now.
'Cause them Yankees
want to kill him real bad.
Yeah, well, a nigger with guns
is still a nervous thing to me.
[Chuckles]
[Footsteps Approaching]
We're lookin'
for the Dorr's place, ma'am.
It's just up the road.
Who are you?
Why, we are Southern men,
and hungry.
You don't look
like Southern men.
How do I know?
Woman, my name is Crawford,
one of the Six Point Creek
Crawfords.
Do you know me?
I knew the father.
Well, come on.
Eat as what we have.
[Sniffs]
Whoo.
[Quiet Chattering]
You're an interestin'
foreigner, Jake.
Why is that?
I hear your pa's a Dutchman.
That you're loyal to here and
not the North. It's uncommon.
No, Jake may have been
born a Dutchman,
but my ma and pa
practically raised him.
He's as Southern
as they come.
[Chickens Clucking]
[Gun Cocks]
Where's the other one,
you devil?
Speak up now,
and maybe you'll live.
I'm alone.
That's my daddy's horse.
He was shot off it
three days back.
He's lyin'. Let's
parole him to Jesus,
and right now.
[Gunshot, Horses Neighing]
Jake, get in here!
Get the horses!
[Gunshots, Shouting]
[Horses Neighing,

Damn!
They took my pinky!
You boys, cover all sides!
[Shouting Continues]
Damn! Cover the women!
Go over there!

- Ahhh!

Please, ma'am,
get over there!
No!

- Ow! Damn!
Don't fret
about that now!
[Coughs]
- [Screaming Continues]
- Cease fire!
- Cease fire!
- Hold your fire!
I said, cease fire,
goddamn it!
Control your fire!
[Panting]
Do you kill women?
There's women in here!
[Man]
No, we don't kill women!
Send 'em out now...
and they'll be safe!
Please, ma'am,
you and your daughter
got to go.
We are goin', son.
You best believe it, there
ain't no way we're not goin'.

Get back, Lewis!
We'll kill them yet!
We'll just have to take
our chances running!
They'll whittle us down!
There ain't so much as a stump
out there for cover!

Did you see my brother?
Uh-uh.
- Black John. With him alive.
- With Black John? Alive?
Whoo!
That was sure enough!
They left us hurt.
This way, boys.
Hyah! Come on.
Turner.
[Turner Gags]
[Man]
Jake? Well, Jack Bull.
Jake Roedel.
Well, Alf Bowden,
you sure are in a fix.
Seems so.
Surely does seem so.
Do you know this man?
Certainly.
His daddy's place
is just downriver
from the Chiles'.
Hemp growers.
Jack Bull.
Goes it at home?
No, no, no.
It all just goes on.
Some may have died,
not most.
What of my mother?
Well, now...
Well, she is watched.
All the secess
are watched.
And my father?
He comes and goes.
He's a Union man.
He ain't bothered by no one.
You must know that.
You must know the whole town
talks about you boys
out here black-flaggin' it.
Some friendliness
may be lost for your kin.
[Man]
Come on, now.
You been fed?
Not so as you notice.
I'll look into it.
Roedel.
Now, take this down. This
is for the Lexington Union News.
So do it fine
the way you do.
Gladly.
"Dear Citizens,
"The stakes are most common
these days in deadly foray.
"The Federals
are to hang William Lloyd
and James Curtain,
"two fine sons of Missouri.
"But by a provident
cut of the cards,
"four Federals
have been dealt to me,
"and it is their hope that Lloyd
and Curtain are not hanged,
"as they would provide
the sequel to these murders.
"However,
if our boys are released,
"I will, as a gentlemen,
"release these unfortunates.
"The choice is yours, citizens,
so make it wisely.
"Signed, John Ambrose
and George Clyde,
Commander and First,
Irregulars."
That's good.
Put a note on it that says,
"What you think we ain't,
we are. Remember it."
Who will deliver it?
There are Federals
all over Lexington.
We could slip
a man in there.
We done it before.
Oh, I reckon a citizen
could be pressed into service,
if one could be found.
That might be a job,
for citizens are cautious
hereabouts.
You got some
better idea, Dutchie?
Maybe you should
volunteer yourself.
Well, there is a way we could
prove more things than one.
If we send a prisoner, it would
prove we have prisoners,
and also, he can attest
to our intentions.
It seems to me he could get
more quickly into town as well.
And time is short.
Lloyd and Curtain will be hanged
right quick, I would think.
It's a good idea.
Some fine touches to it.
Yeah, you should
speak up more, Roedel.
You're not near so dumb
as you let on.
Awww.
Now, go put one of them
Federals on a horse
with that letter.
Convince them to see
this deal through, Alf.
We're only askin' to be treated
like the soldiers that we are.
We shall do the same
for your companions here.
Do your best.
Huh.
What are you lookin' at?
(sing)(music)(music) [Banjo]
[Chattering, Laughter]
Jake.
Aw.
Black John
says you're lettered.
It's Union mail.
He wants you
to look it over, tell him if
there's anything to learn.
All right.
Well, it's just stuff
from up north.
There's no military
intelligence in here.
[Black John]
Well, maybe you could read it
to us just the same.
Read us this letter,
Dutchie.
That's someone else's letter.
Was. I wanna
hear you read it.
I don't think I care to.
Oh, is that so? Well,
I think that if you think
a little bit more, Dutchie,
you'll think you do
wanna read at me.
Right now, too.
How do we know there
might be secrets in it?
Read it at us.
[Man]
Yeah, come on, Dutchie.
[Laughter]
All right.
This here is from
Mrs. Mary Williams
of Bear Lake, Wisconsin.
"Dear Sons,
No word of you in so long,
"right past first frost
of the year last.
"Your father is better,
but his feet
are still bloatin'.
He won't walk right
on them."
That's the blood does that.
The blood bloats the feet.
"Fire hit the old church.
Burned down.
"The new one was just ready,
so no great trouble
was had of it.
"Margaret is married
since the frost
of this year last.
"You wouldn't know it,
for how could you?
Her husband is Walter Maddox.
"He is out of the war, with
one arm busted at New Madrid.
"But it works fine enough.
"The dirt was turned over,
and the smell and deepness
gave me heart.
It is just black rich.
You boys know how that is."
My daddy was up there.
He was up there
way before they hung him.
He said the dirt was so rich
you could've et it
like porridge.
Yeah, very good dirt up there.
Short grow season.
Yeah, sounds like
real good dirt to me.
"That girl Dave got sweet for
is in town and still
single and about.
"She asks of you, but I have
no news since first frost
of the year last.
"Without news,
I cannot answer her.
You are both missed here.
Your mother."
Sounds like my mother.
What a woman does.
One mother's
very much like another.
Remember one thing:
Her boys will kill you
if they can.
[Sighs]
What is it, Jake?
I hear you ruminatin' louder
than a cow chaining my ear,
and it's keepin' me
from my sleep.
Do you think Alf Bowden's made
it back to Lexington as yet?
There was a minute there
when I saw him ridin' off,
and I thought maybe
you and me could join him.
That we could all
ride home together.
Just ride back home.
What have you left at home
you're so anxious
to ride back to?
Nothin'.
Just a passel of memories.
Mostly memories
of you and me.
Of your father,
old Asa Chiles.
We'll stick together, Jack Bull.
We'll get all of it back.
You're a black magician
who can raise the dead, are ya?
No, my father's
under the dirt to stay.
Like that's
goin' to stay too.
My finger?
Mm-hmm.
Well, so it is.
And it makes me notable
by the loss.
You sound pleased,
as if that finger had been
pesterin' you for rings.
No, it was a fine finger,
and I'd rather have it still.
But it was took from me,
and it's been et by chickens
for sure.
And I say,
"What is the good side
to this amputation?
And there is one.
Name it, Jake.
Well, say one day
some Federals...
catch up to me and
kill me in a thicket.
They would riddle me
and hang me,
and no Southern man
would find me for months.
When they did, I'd be
bad meat, pretty well
rotted to a glob.
You're scientifically
accurate, I'm afraid.
I've seen it.
I'd be a mysterious
gob of rot.
People would say,
"Who was that?"
And surely someone
would look up and say,
"Why, it's nubbin-fingered
Jake Roedel."
And then you could go
and tell my father
I was clearly murdered,
and he wouldn't be tortured
by uncertain wonders.
And that's the good of it?
Yes, sir,
that's the good.
[Chuckles]
Go to sleep, Jake Roedel.
[Snickers]
[Black John]
It is time for our winter
hibernation.
I have gathered
the names of loyal Southerners
who shall provide for us.
We'll group in fours.
I'll send word
the beginnin' of spring
for where to rendezvous.
We shall
to the Evans farm, boys.
Their place
is about half a mile
from the Willards',
where there resides
a certain Miss Juanita,
to whom, if I
do not flatter myself,
my attentions are not
unfavorably regarded.
You mean to say we're to spend
the winter in Lafayette...
solely on account that you're
sweet on Juanita Willard?
That's as good a reason
as any, Dutchie.
Nolan's brought
some news from home.
Hank Patterson is murdered.
Our old neighbor Jansen got him
with his gang of militia.
That's sad. He was
a good Southern man.
What of Thomas?
Oh, he is murdered too.
And Sally Burgess
married a Federal from Michigan.
[Laughs]
Her whole family
hides their faces.
And...
well, Dutchie,
that Federal,
Alf Bowden,
he rode straight from here
and killed your father.
He shot him in the neck
down by the river,
then booted him
along Main Street till he died.
I spared Alf Bowden.
You all know it.
You taught him nicely,
but he forgot the lesson.
But my father...
My father was a Unionist
like all the Germans.
An unconditional Unionist.
Well, yeah,
but he was mainly known
as your father, Dutchie.
You got a reputation now.
[Man]
Come here, boys.
[Clyde]
Good day, sir.
Abel Evans.
George Clyde.
Sorry we can't all be
of proper hospitality, but
with the Federal patrols...
We're much obliged.
May I ask after Mrs. Evans?
My wife. Well, she's as well
as can be expected.
Our other Mrs. Evans,
Sue Lee...
Well, she was a Mrs. Evans
for but three weeks...
until my son joined
our Confederate forces.
He was killed
in the fightin'
at Independence.
We're sorry
to hear of it.
Yes, well,
you boys lay low.
We'll come by
from time to time
with provisions...
such as there are.
[Clyde]
We're much obliged.
[Grunting]
[Grunting,
Digging Continue]
Been a while since we done work.
Somethin' soothin' to it.
Yeah, well, work has never
been my main ambition.
We've done much work.
I think I've spied
an easier way to riches.
Spell out this miracle.
You just ride on up
and take it.
Ah, good old rule.
Simple plan.
It's a workable method
that is proven.
[All Grunting]
George, you got
mud in your eye.
[Both Laughing]
[Jake]
Rider's comin'.
Let's go see our visitor.
[Woman]
Good day. Don't shoot
or some dumb thing like that.
Whoa.
Well, how do? You
must be Mrs. Evans.
I brung you some supper.
I'm, uh, pleased
to meet you, Mr...
Chiles.
Mr. Jack Bull Chiles.
This is Jake Roedel.
And...
George Clyde, Mrs. Evans.
Mr. Evans wishes me
to apologize for not havin'
sent you food sooner.
The Federals
have been on the move.
Don't you call me Mrs. Evans.
My name is Sue Lee Shelley.
It's a good one,
and I am a widow now.
Reckon I'll go back to it
and use it.
Please pardon me.
Won't you come in?
It's not much to gaze upon,
but I reckon we could assay
some hospitality.
George.
After me, ma'am.
[Jack Bull]
Right this way, ma'am.
Excuse me.
[Sue Lee]
Thank you.
Damn.
What are you smilin' at?
I'll see to that mule.
Wait a second.
What did you say?
I say I'll look to him.
You better go on in there,
let that woman see your face.
Damnation, Holt.
I think I know best how
to handle my personal affairs.
Now, you see that lady's mule
while I check on what
she brung to eat.
[Jack Bull]
Excuse the mud. We'll just...
There you are, ma'am.
My! Aren't you
bushwhackers the gentlemen.
We try to make
the effort when
possible, ma'am.
Do you think manners
should be dropped
in times like these?
No. But I don't think
horse sense oughta be
dropped either.
It's cold.
[Chuckles]
You're so kind
to think of us, ma'am.
You men think of us more.
You do the good work.
I know it's dirty
and it's dangerous.
Those are good words
to hear, ma'am.
It's not always
we hear them.
[Clears Throat]
Well, I really
should be goin'.
Mrs. Evans will worry
if I don't.
Uh, ma'am?
We're awful sorry about
Evans, Jr. Gettin' killed.
Well, we all suffer,
but he suffers no more.
He was a good husband to me.
For three weeks
he was a good husband,
but he didn't last.
What's he doin' here,
inside?
Oh, ma'am,
this nigger's with me.
His name is Holt.
Well, wouldn't he be more useful
off in a field, plowin'?
[Chuckles]
Oh, no, I reckon not.
No, ma'am.
That's one nigger I wouldn't try
to hitch behind a plow.
No, I wouldn't try that.
Well, now.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Mr. Evans asked
that you come to the house
tomorrow evenin' after dark.
He's up on latest
Federal movements, and he
could post you on 'em.
Why, we'd be honored.
Um, I'm not sure about him.
Mr. Evans...
You ain't got nothin'
to worry about on that score.
You needn't worry about Holt.
I'll be takin' Holt with me
to the Willards' tomorrow.
We won't be comin'
to your dinner.
Mr. Clyde, honestly,
I didn't mean to speak ill
of your nigger.
He's not my nigger.
He's just a nigger who
I trust with my life every day
and night, that's all.
- That's very high praise.
- Yes, ma'am, it is.
I see.
Well, gentlemen,
I really must take my leave.
I hope the food'll
please you.
It looks wonderful.
Why, thank you.
Now, good night, all.
- Good night.
- Good night, ma'am.
Holt, the lady said
good night to all.
Touch your hat
and say good night.
- You don't tell him nothin'.
- He's bein' rude.
- Gentlemen, please.
- He don't need no tellin'.
George.
Good night, missy.
Good night, Holt.
I'll see the lady
to her mule.
Holt.
It won't be
a hardship, George.
Well, let's eat.
This smells good.
Be careful.
Holt, you want my bacon?
I could eat more.
Go on, then.
I appreciate it.
Roedel...
do you want my bacon?
Yes, I could eat it.
Well, I'll shit it
out by the oak tree
in the mornin'.
You can just go
and help yourself.
[Laughing]
[Laughs, Coughing]
[All Laughing]
And why, if you do not mind
my askin', did you not join
the regular army?
Army? Well,
we thought of it.
I suppose we decided
this fight's got to be made
in our own country,
not where some general
tells us it should happen.
It soon will be everywhere.
My family and I,
we will be quittin'
this house in the spring.
As soon as the roads are clear,
we're gonna be tryin' for Texas.
About half of Missouri's
went to Texas.
Now, the whole state's
thick with invaders.
We cannot
drive them away.
We have different thoughts.
I still want to fight.
I reckon I'll always
want to fight them.
Always.
Have you ever been
to Lawrence, Kansas, young man?
[Scoffs]
No, I reckon not, Mr. Evans.
I don't believe I'd be
too welcome in Lawrence.
I didn't think so.
Before this war began,
my business
took me there often.
As I saw those Northerners
build that town,
I witnessed the seeds
of our destruction being sown.
The foundin' of that town
was truly the beginnin'
of the Yankee invasion.
I'm not speakin' of numbers,
nor even abolitionist
trouble-makin'.
It was the schoolhouse.
Before they built
their church, even,
they built that schoolhouse.
And they let in
every tailor's son...
and every farmer's daughter
in that country.
Spellin' won't help you
hold a plow any firmer.
Or a gun either.
No, it won't, Mr. Chiles.
But my point is merely...
that they rounded every pup
up into that schoolhouse...
because they fancied
that everyone should think...
and talk the same
free-thinkin' way they do...
with no regard
to station, custom,
propriety.
And that is why they will win.
Because they believe everyone
should live and think
just like them.
And we shall lose because we
don't care one way or another...
how they live.
We just worry about ourselves.
Are you sayin', sir,
that we fight for nothin'?
Far from it, Mr. Chiles.
You fight for everything
that we ever had.
As did my son.
It's just that
we don't have it anymore.
Mr. Evans, when you
get back from Texas,
it'll all be here
waitin' for you.
Jack Bull and me,
we'll see to it.
Well... yes.
Thank you, son.
Well, enough of this war talk.
Let's have the ladies join us
and think nobler thoughts.
Lydia!
[Jack Bull]
Fine idea.
Some company
would be splendid.
We should be thinkin'
about gettin'back.
The Federals
could pass by anytime.
Sue Lee!
Oh, put a gown on, Jake.
It's too cold.
They'll all be
in front of the fire
examinin' their plunder.
I, uh, have it in me to sing
Shall we have a sing-along?
Oh, yes.
I like those the best.
[Clears Throat]
My voice is not
what it should be,
but it was once rumored
that I could carry a tune.
- And you, Mr. Roedel?
- I believe I won't sing.
Young ears are present.
- I bet you sing lovely.
- You would lose that bet.
He really does sing
very poorly, but he imitates
the turkey first-rate.
- [Giggles]
- I best do my gobblin'
out of doors.
You go ahead and sing along.
I'll keep my eye on the road.
- Do you really think that...
- Good man, Jake.
I'll relieve you soon.
[Door Closes]
[Clears Throat]
(sing)(music)(music) [Faint Singing]
(sing)(music)(music) [Singing Continues]
[Clattering]
Clyde back?
I believe he's fixin'
to pass a few more hours
with Miss Juanita.
Jack Bull?
He's covered
in Miss Sue Lee Evans.
You mean Sue Lee Shelley.
Roedel?
Yeah, Holt?
What's that?
I've been keeping 'em.
Nobody ever learned me letters.
When you were readin'
the mails out loud,
it was somethin' the likes
of which I'd never heard.
Got me thinkin' you might
sometime try it again.
So you packed those
and kept 'em all this time?
It might not be
too amusin'.
It might just be a bunch
of borin' thoughts from one
stranger to another.
That one you read
from the mother was fine.
You recall it?
Yeah.
She said things
I enjoyed to hear.
[Opening Letter]
All right, here goes.
"Dear Brother, I must
write this right quick...
"'cause I say good-bye
to Massachusetts
and our home in one hour.
"Yes, Danny,
I've joined the fight,
"and a difficulter decision
never before was made,
"as I've been just about the
only eligible bachelor to dance
with at Parlans' this year.
"Without my favorite brother,
it is not the same,
"although the beer
has been free,
"as I've been drinkin' it with
one of the Parlans' daughters.
"Which one, I will not tell.
Here's to you, Danny, and keep
your head low out there. Bill."
It could come to where
you could maybe like that man.
Yeah, in other times
he would not be so bad.
I think, though, I like
the one from the mama best.
Holt, where is your mother?
Ahh...
Kansas or Kingdom.
I don't know.
[Sighs]
I know she was sold into Texas.
I reckon she in Texas.
How was that?
Was that George that sold her?
No, sir. George and me,
we growed up neighbors.
It was George
what bought me out
when Master Henry passed,
but he didn't have no means
for my mama or my sister.
- So Clyde owns you?
- No, sir.
Not in greenbacks
and coppers, no how.
No, he don't own me
that way.
Nope.
He made it out a gift.
[Knocking]
It's me.
Hey, Jake.
[Grunts]
Hey, Miss Wild,
you splattered poor Holt.
[Sue Lee]
Well, it surely is.
Oh, no. Mm-mm.
[Screaming]
[Laughing]
Whoa, mule,
settle down there!
Mule? A mule?
Just calm down.
Well, do I look
muley to you?
Why, no.
Well, does that look
like a mule to you?
Does that look like
the rear end of an animal
that hee-haws in the night?
It looks like
it might could be.
Jack Bull Chiles!
Just 'cause I'm a widow...
don't mean that you can get
that familiar with me.
Pardon me, ma'am,
but I believe it was you that
shoved your rump into my face.
That was only
just to make a point.
You made it.
I'll always know your rump
from a mule's now.
Several differences.
Don't know how I missed
'em before.
[Gasps]
Well, don't be mean.
I can't tolerate
meanness.
Is that too mean?
No. It's really
not too mean at all.
Oh, for cryin' out loud!
We're sittin' right here.
Show us some mercy.
[Panting]
He really is quite right.
I better get back
to the house.
Cover your tracks
in the snow too.
You'll be leadin'
curious Federals
right onto us.
Don't be rude.
There's no reason to be rude.
There happens to be
a war goin'on...
everywhere but between
your two ears, you dumb ox.
Dumb ox, am I?
[Grunts]
Sorry, Jake. My leg
just did that on its own.
No thought behind it.
I hear you. I hear you.
But Holt and me ain't dyin'
just so you could be kissed.
Leave Holt out of this.
Holt ain't even here.
Holt ain't nowhere near here.
I don't think anybody's
about to die from my kiss.
In fact, she seems
to be doin' tolerably well.
Well enough
to get goin' too.
Good day.
You reckon George Clyde'll ever
join up with us again,
or do you think Juanita Willard
will be his only cause and
comfort from here on?
Ah, George is efficient
when it comes to comfort.
This thing with Sue Lee and you,
will it go on?
I reckon.
Well, that's good for you.
Yeah, I believe
I'll marry her.
I believe you should.
Sue Lee'll be by
this evening.
Oh, good.
It's been near a week
since I've seen her.
Yeah, all this warmth
has the Federals out
for jaunts.
It's kept her home.
It won't be long before
we join 'em out there.
No, it won't.
That's why I want to ask
somethin' of you and Holt.
Name it.
Well, future best man,
I'd like to ask you
for some privacy.
Oh, you would, would you?
It's not much to ask.
And what are Holt
and me to do?
Anything you'd like.
Throw walnuts at squirrels.
Play mumblety-peg.
I reckon we could come up
with a better use of our time
than that, eh, Holt?
It's possible.
Howdy.
Ahem, brung you two
somethin'.
Try this bread, boys.
Why, thank you.
Did you make it?
No. Miss Evans' sister
lives in town.
She's a Federal,
but a sister still.
She gave us two loaves.
Well, that's kind of her.
You thank her for us,
won't you?
I don't suppose
I'll tell her where it went.
That might not do.
[Clears Throat]
Well, this good weather has me and
Holt wantin' to fling walnuts...
at mumblety-peg players
or something
along those lines.
All right.
Now have fun.
[Whispering]
Jake, one hour, please.
[Jake's Voice]
"Dearest Ruth Ann,
"I trust this letter
will reach you before winter.
"Here it is always
a sort of winter,
as folks are so cold now.
"Rebels are out of the city
as far as armies go,
"but there are copperheads
around performing misdeeds.
"So much cruelty goes on.
"Prison is full of rebels
and they are left to waste away
so pitifully.
"They are traitors
but also human.
"If you looked in on them,
you would not believe
that they were...
"for they so resemble
scarecrows now.
"Father believes
the war will go on and on...
"but is ever more committed
to the... struggle.
"He manages to send
ever greater numbers of slaves
up north...
"to freedom and away
from the grasping hands
of their masters,
"who even in the midst of all
attempt to lay claim to them.
"The Confederates claim that
we strike at their liberty
and rights,
"but what kind of liberty is it
that takes away the liberty
of others?
The war will end."
Has it been an hour yet?
No, ain't an hour
passed yet.
Roedel,
you know my name?
It's Holt.
No, my whole name.
My whole name is Daniel Holt.
Daniel,
like that lion's den man.
You know his story?
Of course I do.
They throwed Daniel
to the lions, but he weren't
never ate.
Daniel.
That's what my mama named me.
Is it an hour now?
An hour and two...
[Gunshots]
That's the Evans' place.
[Gunshots Continue]
[Horse Whinnying]
- [Sue Lee Gasps]
- Jake.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Gunshots in the Evans'.
I heard 'em.
Holt!
Jake.
Sue Lee, you stay put.
There's gonna be a fight.
[Jake]
Holt, got 'em guns?
[Holt]
Take it easy.
Bring her in! Bring her in!
Jack Bull, let's go!
[Horse Whinnying]
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
[Screaming]
Boys, they killed him!
How many were there?
They killed him!
He's dead!
[Woman Crying]
He's... He's...
What will I do?
Heard all the way
from the Willards'.
Thought you boys
might need a spot.
How many?
I don't know!
A dozen or less.
Well, shit,
then let's get 'em!
Come on!
- Hyah!
- [Holt] Roedel!
[Crying Continues]
- [Gunshots]
- [Horses Whinnying]
[Shouting]
[Shouting Continues]
Die, you bastards!
Ow! Damn!
Jake! Go pull them!
Get them, Holt!
Jake!
[Horse Whinnies]
Hyah!
[Jack Groaning]
[Groaning Continues]
[Yells]
[Grunting]
Oh, shit.
You'll be all right.
You'll be okay.
[Grunting Continues]
[Jack Shouting]
- That fire's got to go out.
- We're heatin' water.
Heat it quick.
They'll come back with more men
if they got 'em.
We can't have 'em
smellin'that fire.
- That arm's gonna
have to come off.
- [Grunts]
He's gonna need it.
We can heal it.
Dutchie, we got no medicines
or doctors amongst
the whole group of us,
and I can't go shanghai
a sawbones neither.
Federals'll likely be on us
pursuin' him.
[Sighs]
I'll mend them.
I can nurse him with Jake.
As you say,
but you watch out green rot
don't get started on him,
'cause once it does,
it's over.
That look none too good,
Roedel.
Goddamn it,
don't nobody say that again!
- We're gonna burn
the wound closed.
- No!
[Jake]
Hold him.
[Jack] No.
[Jack Yelling]
[Screams]
[Door Opens]
There's men on the road.
[Clyde]
How many?
More than a few.
They been comin'
into the woods.
Keep the watch.
I wanna fight away from here
if we got to fight.
What came of Miss Evans
and Mary?
The Willards took them up.
They all headed out of here.
Willards too?
Said they was goin'south.
Maybe I should try
to find us a doctor tonight.
Where from?
There's one in Kingsview.
You can't make it there
and back in one night.
I know that, Dutchie.
I can lay up near there
and try and drag one back
next night.
If I can't find a doc,
I'll head on
to Captain Purdee's.
Holt'll look after you
and the widow.
I wish you luck.
[Gags, Coughs]
That arm done for.
Oh, I know it.
I hoped it wouldn't be.
It's done for.
Maybe George
will bring the doctor.
He may see something we don't.
You know good as I
George Clyde done ride
straight to Captain Purdee's.
It's just us now, Roedel.
It's time.
The longer you wait,
the harder it gets on the man.
Will you shut up on that?
Please, just give me peace
for a while.
Jake.
Jack Bull.
You look sad.
We're takin' care of you.
You'll be mended.
We're fixin' it.
I always knew
we'd be killed.
One or both of us.
Do you recall the pies
on Mother's sill?
Of course I do.
Those were good eatin' times.
Right they were.
I always thought
it'd be you, Jake.
I'm dyin'.
I was certain
I'd have to bury you.
I wish you were.
[Laughs]
Me too.
Sue Lee.
I'm right here.
Good.
That's good.
Them veins is blackenin'
all the way up to his armpit.
We've got to do it now.
Can you do it?
[Grunting]
[Jack Yelling]
If he screams too loud, we may
all die. Put that in his mouth.
Don't let him scream too loud.
Keep his jaw clamped down
on that stick.
Holt, you hold him down
whenever he starts to flop.
[Grunting Continues]
No!
[Screaming]
[Screaming Continues]
We should be gettin' to
Captain Purdee's.
I gotta head south first.
Sue Lee, you'll need a place.
We'll go to the Brown's farm.
Those are Cave Wyatt's people.
They're far away
from all this.
You're not to worry, young man.
She'll be just fine.
Just give us time.
[Footsteps]
Jake.
The war hadn't
come down here yet.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Holt and me...
Well, George Clyde
should be missin'us.
You don't have
to go back, Jake.
Mr. Brown says you boys
are more than welcome
to stay here and work the farm.
He could use you.
You'll do all right here.
Holt and me will come by again
just as soon as we can
and see to it.
[Man]
Who goes there?
Who the hell
do you think we are?
You smell like a couple
of piles of fine Southern shit.
Welcome back to hell, boys.
While you boys
were sunnin' yourselves
down at the border,
things have turned
rather interesting here.
Federals everywhere.
[Clyde]
Welsh's boys got caught
down in Pattonsburg.
Heads... cut off.
Some of us still ride.
Anderson, Todd...
Scalpin' every nigger
they can find.
Except, of course, our own.
[Clyde]
But there's still riches
to be had, right, boys?
(sing)(music)(music) [Banjo]
[Man Singing, Indistinct]
[Singing Continues,
Indistinct]
Best to stay clear
of Black John right now.
[Man]
You know, when that women's jail
collapsed in Kansas City,
his women folk were in it.
Three of' em
done in by the Federals.
He's been acting kind of itchy,
if you know what I mean.
Word is Black John called
for Quantrill and his boys
to come join us.
- Quantrill?
- [Singing Continues]
There's some crazy talkin' here.
Quantrill's plannin' on ridin'
on Kansas is what I hear.
Maybe that.
[Jake]
A raid into Kansas?
We might get over there, sure,
but gettin'back
will be suicide...
once the Kansas Fifth
gets on our tail.
You got that, Roedel,
but why not?
It's suicide sittin' in these
woods, waitin' for them Federals
to pick us off anyhow.
I'm short on cash.
Will these do?
That's two nigger scalps?
I'll see you with one
Dutch scalp.
I'm out on this one.
I just got money.
Don't worry, Turner,
we'll take your money.
[Laughing]
[Men Shouting]
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
Come on! Get him!
Holt.
Come on over
and share some whiskey.
I got work back here
to finish.
Well, when
you're finished up then.
[Man] Well, lookee here.
You two sure got to be pals now,
didn't you?
I mean, ever since you boys
come back, you been clappin'
your gums together.
Regular as crones.
George.
My boys,
today I am a sad man.
I am sad because I mourn for
our sisters and mothers...
who slept
in that Kansas City jail...
who slept until the walls
fell down around them
and they died.
I am sad, boys,
and I am tired.
The best of us are dead,
and now we're just dogs
chased into the woods.
I am sad, boys,
but I am vengeful.
And I shall not sleep...
I shall not sleep again until
I stand upon Mount Oriad...
and I look down upon
the abolitionists of Lawrence.
Yeah, kill those thieving
Jayhawkers!
Yeah, kill them!
I shall ride through Kansas
to get there, boys,
and meet any Yankee army
put in my way...
because I will fight them myself
if I have to.
But I shall reach Lawrence.
That's right.
I will... fight them all myself,
unless there be any men
among you...
who would ride with me.
[Chattering]
So I'm asking...
are there any men here
who would ride with me?
[All]
Yeah! Let's all go!
Then, hell, boys,
ride with me to Lawrence!
[All Shouting]
To Lawrence! To Lawrence!
Let's ride to Lawrence!
[Shouting, Whistling]
Down to Lawrence!
All right!
Yeah!
[Shouting Continues]
Yeah.
Two miles ahead, sir.
Well done, Colonel.
All clear!
Round up!
Come on, boys!
[Clyde]
Get on your horses, men.
Let's move.
[Man]
All right, boys. Join up
at the back of this column.
[Chattering Continues]
[Man]
Come on, men.
I wanna see you awake!
Wake up!
We'll make it before sunup
if you ride now hard!
Come on!
Pick it up now!
Sweet dreams, Dutchie, huh?
[Chuckles]
Go back to sleep.
You just may wake up
in Lawrence tomorrow.
Ride, men.
[Black John]
You and the boys
take the river north.
I want you scoutin'up
toward the west.
Make God's work of it, boys.
We'll wait for first fire.
Head out.
I want your boys
to be settin' up a post
on Mount Oriad.
Watch the road
from Fort Leavenworth.
Any dirt kicks up,
I want word sent down
straight away.
Here's the death list.
You shall cross off
every name.
[Horse Approaching]

Where is your army?
Who are we to fight?
Who are we to fight?
You are cowards all!
Send him to hell!
[Screaming]
[Men Shouting]
Let's get the hell out of here!
See that pipe there
on the end?
And some tobacco.
All right, Rocky.
We had thought
this would be a real fight.
But it's just bad luck citizens
finding out just how bad
luck can be.
They ought not to murder
the young ones.
[Man]
Just another nigger.
[Jake] Holt,
let's get us some eggs.
Yeah, Roedel. Let's get us
all the eggs they got.
And some ham.
Hey, boy! You...
[Grunting]
Hey!
Hey, this man's with us,
you fool!
Huh?
That's George Clyde's nigger,
you fool!
You were makin'
breakfast there?
Yes.
[Jake]
What were you makin'?
Potatoes.
And coffee?
Yes.
Let's have us
some breakfast then.
- Mister...
- Shut up.
More coffee,
if you please, ma'am.
Jake Roedel.
Whoa!
Pitt.
Bring those two outside.
I wanna show 'em somethin'.
We'll see to them
once we've had our vittles.
Why, you little Dutch
son of a bitch, you do what
I tell you or I'll kill you.
And when you figure to do this
mean thing to me, Mackerson,
is this very moment
convenient for you?
It is for me.
Let's just take him out.
Nope.
That won't work.
The hell with it.
There's plenty more of them
Jayhawkers to kill anyhow.
I'll see you back in Missouri,
you tiny sack of shit.
You know where to find me.
[Man]
That's Pitt Mackerson,
ain't it?
I hear he'd as soon kill a man
as mash a tick.
My, what a scary fella
he is.
I like you, son,
but that bastard will have
your scalp if you ain't careful.
Thank you, mister.
Thank you. There ain't
enough thanks in the world...
Oh, you go to hell!
[Man] Now, now, boys!
Federals comin' eight miles out.
Let's go!
Come on!
Get on your horses!
Thank you, ma'am.
Have a good day.
Get those horses round up!
[Shouting, Chattering]
[Women Chattering]
[Shouting, Hooting]
We're too slow, men!
Drop that damn piano!
Let's go!
Hey, Roedel.
I heard disappointing words
on you, Roedel.
Is that so?
Are you a traitor, Roedel?
You know I'm not.
Well, you spared, boy.
I told you not to spare.
Don't think you are a good man
'cause that will spoil you.
[Man]
Federal troops, sir,
closing from behind.
This is it, boys!
This is our last chance!
I'll do what I can for you.
[Man]
Remember your families!
They're right behind!
Goddamn it!
Company halt!
Halt!

Hyah! Hyah!
Let's go!
Fall back!
[Man]
Stand firm, boys!
They'll be coming!
Passing through!
Ride on through!
[Shouting Continues,

Secure your horses
and form a line.
Cover the left.
Secure your horses
and form a second line!
Form a line!
Stand strong, men!
Hold your fire
till we feel their hooves!

Come on.
Holt, come on!
Let's go, Holt.

He's dead, Holt!

Fall back! Fall back!
Come on, Holt!
We gotta go!
[Shouting, Indistinct]
George!
Go right now!
[Screaming]
Pitt, I'm gonna kill you!
[Screaming Continues]
We'll make
for the Brown farm.
Are you gonna make it?
[Sniffling]
Yeah, you're gonna make it.
I'll set you boys up
in the parlor here.
Much obliged, Ort.
[Woman]
Ort, who is that?
Well, take a look.
I'll just be stayin' the night.
[Woman]
Is that my little Cave?
Aunt Wilma.
Oh!
Oh, it's good to see you,
Cave.
Are you hurt again?
Well, yeah.
But I didn't do it
to myself, you know.
Holt and me,
we been shot.
Well, you should have
expected it.
I hear you sayin' it.
[Baby Crying]
[Crying Continues]
Well?
What do you think of her?
Cave, dear, come on.
Come on, Cave.
[Door Closes]
Her name's Grace.
Grace Shelley Chiles,
as far as I'm concerned.
Okay.
Looks all right to me.
[Baby Fussing]
Here, I'll change her.
[Grace Crying]
Oh, Grace.
There you go, sweetie.
Come on now.
[Sue Lee]
Let me take a look
at your bad spot, Jake.
- I wanna make sure it's clean.
- Oh, yeah. It's clean enough.
No, Jake.
Clean enough ain't good enough.
You should know that.
And you too, Holt.
Let me take a look.
[Whinnies]
Remember, when you're fixed up,
you can come down,
join the Regulars with me.
Maybe that.
Uh, Ort tells me
when you brung that girl here,
she was already pregnant.
You better marry her, boy.
It ain't right not to.
- Me?
- Yeah.
No, no. Not me.
I ain't gotta marry nobody.
Is that right?
You're that kind of man,
Dutchie?
Well, I will
take care of her, Cave.
It'll be took care of somehow
when it can be.
Well, that's all I ask.
'Cause everybody likes her
real good, you know.
Ort and Wilma there...
they already think of her
as somethin' of a daughter.
Well, that's good to hear.
[Door Opens, Closes]
How's your rib?
None too good.
How's your leg?
Same.
Mmm.
I have a thing or two
to say to you, Jake.
Well, speak up.
Uh, think I'll take a walk.
[Sighs]
[Sighs]
What's this trash I hear
about you bein' my fiancé?
Ah, so you've heard that.
Well, that was sprung on me
by Cave.
You see, they all seem to think
you was carrying my kid...
'cause l...
well, after Jack Bull...
I brought you here.
Oh.
So do you figure
I ought to be married?
Yeah, if you want to keep
fingers from waggin'
in your face.
That doesn't bother me.
Well, it's also another thing,
Sue Lee.
See, they got a name
for kids without daddies.
You know, it ain't a good one.
I know that.
So do you want
to marry me?
No, not too bad.
Good. That's good news,
'cause I wouldn't marry you for
a wagon-load full of gold.
I bet you wouldn't.
I wouldn't marry you...
even if you weren't
some runty little Dutchman
with a nubbin for a finger.
Fine.
That's damn fine.
I wouldn't want a wife
that didn't know how
to keep her place.
Anyhow, it's a proven thing
that being your man is just
plain bad luck,
and I don't need to marry
any of that.
Well, it's true.
Guess it's true.
Oh, you're not bad luck.
You just had bad luck
is all.
I need convincing
you mean that.
I need convincin'
that you were right.
Thank you, ma'am.
You're welcome.
Think I might catch
some air.
Well, breathe some for me.
Perhaps you boys can
watch after this little one
while I'm at my chores.
Uh, maybe it's best
you talk to him about that
particular line of work.
Who, me?
[Sue Lee]
That's right.
[Fussing]
'Bout time we have some help
around here.
Be back around noontime.
Sue Lee, wait a second.
[Jake]
Oh. Come on.
[Grace Crying]
[Crying Continues]
Oh, come on.
[Crying Continues]
[Laughing]
Hoo! Hee!
Hi! Hoo!
[Crying Continues]
[Crying Stops]
I knew that nubbin
would be good for somethin'.
[Footsteps Approaching]
[Door Closes]
Where you been?
She been screamin' for hours.
Sweet thing wants some sucklin',
but Mama's been busy.
Here, I'll feed her.
No, you won't.
I just got this thing
taken care of.
- She needs to be suckled, Jake.
- Oh, hell.
[Sighs]
[Whispering]
[Fussing]
[Fussing Continues]
Mm-hmm.
[Whispering]
Yes.
They're all busted up.
[Jake]
Quantrill?
Headed to Kentucky.
Anderson?
Dead, I've heard tell.
Clement.
Most of  'em dead.
Pitt Mackerson.
He's got himself
something of a gang,
but these days,
they spend most of their time
robbin' for plunder.
And they don't care
whether they take it
from Southern folks or Federals.
Anyone gets in their way,
off comes their scalp.
Anyhow,
they don't ride much in Jackson
or Cass Counties anymore.
Word has it
they're headin' south.
Probably make you a visit.
Word is, they're makin'
a plan of it, Jake.
[Sniffling, Sighing]
[Sighs, Moans]
Can't sleep?
No.
These quilts are too heavy.
They make me sweat.
Mine too.
You know, Holt, I probably
got one more fight in me.
I'm gonna kill Pitt Mackerson,
either when he comes here...
or when I can get up to find
him out, you know that, Holt?
Yeah, I know it.
What you gonna do
after you kill Pitt?
Join up with them Regulars?
Fight for the cause.
What about you?
You really askin' me?
What cause you think
I got, Roedel?
When them Yankees come
and kill George daddy,
and his brothers
and all his people,
I stood with George Clyde.
Yeah, he was as good a friend
to you as Jack Bull was to me.
Yeah, and they's both good
and dead now, Roedel.
Just as dead as they can be.
Where does that leave
you and me, huh?
Where does that leave me?
Right here, Holt.
Yeah, I know
we's right here.
This ain't nowhere for me.
Reckon I just
don't understand it.
That day George Clyde died,
it changed me.
I felt something that day
I ain't never felt.
You felt that loss.
That hollow feeling.
No.
What I felt was...
free.
I thought that's what George
gave you when he bought you out.
That wasn't really his
to give, was it?
And, George, God,
I believed I loved him.
But being that man's friend...
weren't no different
than being his nigger.
And, Roedel,
I ain't never again
gonna be nobody's nigger.
How you feelin', Dutchie?
Oh, not so bad.
You look like you feel
right good.
You feel good?
I don't feel too bad.
Ah, you seem about
all healed up to me.
Ah, still hurts some.
My leg does.
I gotta go to Hartwell today.
Be back by night, though.
You want me to come along?
No, you go on.
Finish healin'.
I'll take Holt with me, though.
He's a handy man with a gun,
I hear tell.
That's right.
You always gonna stare
like that?
Long as I can.
Well, you're pretty near well,
so it won't be much longer.
Reckon you and Holt will be off
to get shot by some different
fellas here pretty soon.
Maybe I won't.
What'll you do then?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe trek me on over
to California...
and catch me a sailboat
to somewhere sunny.
Is that right?
What grand spot
have you got in mind, Jake?
Sparta.
In Sparta, they have olives.
I got that out of a book.
I could eat me some olives.
I wonder about me.
I ain't goin'sailin'
nowhere, and I know it.
You'll do all right.
A chicken, Wilma?
It ain't Sunday even.
What's with the special favors?
Oh, nothin'. I know Orton
will be mighty tired tonight
when he gets back from his ride.
I intend to feed him well.
That the man?
That's him.
Dutchie Roedel.
- What is this?
- This here is the Reverend
Horace Right.
You're gettin' married
today, Dutchie.
You're gettin'married
or you're gettin'out.
I'm what?
You heard me.
You're all healed up.
I just wanted to make sure
you didn't die slow on me
before I did it.
I can't have it in my house
the way it is.
Holt, saddle my horse.
We're gettin' out of here.
No, you should do right, Roedel.
What on Earth
does that mean?
Let's talk.
Come on.
I do believe that
is a roastin' chicken I smell.
[Sighs]
Are you goin' to or not?
It's bein' shoved
down my throat.
If a thing has got to be shoved,
I like to do the shovin'.
Okay.
[Sighs]
Then get in there
and shove, Jake.
I thought you said
you wouldn't want me...
for a wagon-load of gold
'cause I'm a nubbin-fingered
runt of a Dutchman.
I remember you sayin' that.
Well, I guess I lied.
Are you lyin' again now?
No, I wouldn't lie
to you, Jake.
You just told me
you lied to me before.
Well, that's different.
That was romance.
And now's what?
The truth.
This here now is the truth.
[Reverend]
So you, Jakob Friedrich Roedel,
bein' the man,
take you,
Sue Lee Shelley Evans,
bein' the woman.
So, by the power vested in me,
the two of you is right married.
Ain't it so.
Well, that was sure
a fast ceremony.
Well, I reckon that man would
marry stones to stones if there
was a chicken at the end of it.
That's neither here
nor somewheres else.
He just done
made you legal, boy.
Good night, boys.
Good night, Ort.
[Snoring]
[Snoring Continues]
So you a family man now.
How you feel?
I feel the same, Holt.
Hell, it's only words.
No, that's an oath.
That's words you gotta back up.
Yeah, I know that.
I reckon we'll be haulin' her
and the kid with us now.
Where to?
I don't know.
What do you think
of California?
Boy, what is you doin'?
What am I doin'?
Have you gone blind?
I'm goin' to sleep, Holt.
Fixin' to get me
some sleep.
Roedel,
I gotta tell you this?
Tell me what?
[Chuckling]
You supposed to sleep
with the wife, Roedel.
You got to know that much.
You supposed to share her bed.
That way, if some other man
do that, you shoot him.
Yeah, I know all that.
You bet I know that.
But, hell, this ain't
some regular marriage situation.
What, you don't like her?
You gonna sit up there
and tell me you don't like her?
I like her.
She's pretty enough
and all that.
It's just this marriage thing
has swept up on me kind of
all of a sudden.
Yeah, well,
it is over you, Roedel.
I mean to say,
you done the milkin',
you might as well
have the cream.
Jake.
Hey, take your clothes off.
You don't come to bed
in dirty duds, Jake.
That's a rule.
Just how many rules is it
you got for me, girl?
Don't get mad.
Here, I'll help you.
Hmm.
Are you a virgin?
I've seen plenty.
But have you ever bedded
a woman before?
Girl, I've killed 15 men.
[Chuckling]
Come here.
[Sighs]
Roedel, I'd do a lot for you,
you know that?
You know I do.
It's equal.
Yeah, don't say it.
I got a thing to say.
All right.
Uh,
look, I'll travel with you
and yours till we get passed...
them Injuns and riffraff
in the nation, and then
I got to go off somewhere.
Where is that, Holt?
Well, I ain't decided that
to a definite aim,
but I'm goin'.
I'm goin' to find my mama.
I believe she was sold to Texas,
so that's where I commence
the lookin'.
If she was sold there,
I'll go there and pay
to buy her freedom.
Holt, you done already
paid more than enough to...
Yeah, I, I hear you
sayin' it.
- I wish you well.
- Well, it ain't yet.
I ain't leavin' you till
your little narrow Dutch ass
is past Pitt Mackerson.
Didn't I just through
tellin' you that?
Yeah, you did.
All right.
All right.
[Scissors Snipping]
[Jake]
Good-bye bushwhacker curls.
[Snipping Continues]
There you are, Dutchie.
You look 21 again.
I'm just now 19, Ort.
That so?
Well, you never look
that young.
I said I wouldn't cut my hair
till I was finished
with the war.
And you didn't, Roedel.
You didn't.
Militia find those,
you're not likely to get further
than the nearest hanging tree.
Oh, hell.
Good luck, y'all.
[Wilma, Grace Crying]
[Sighs]
Shh.
[Jake]
Hyah!
[Jake Whistles]
[Chattering]
[Man]
Yes, sir!
[Branches Snapping]
[Horse Whinnying]
[Grace Crying]
[Horses Approaching]
Why, Dutchie, I didn't expect
to see you no more.
Howdy, Pitt.
Turner.
[Turner]
Howdy.
Water's boilin'.
Want some chicory?
I think I will.
I think I'd like
some chicory, Dutchie.
[Grace Fussing]
How are you, Holt?
Rather well.
You two alone?
Just us now.
We've been on the run.
How's Black John?
That's a big question, Dutchie,
'cause the man is dead.
[Pitt]
Black John is dead.
Hell, who ain't?
They got him at Dover.
Put his head on a pole.
Paraded him
right down the street.
Put a picture of it
in their paper.
Quantrill too.
Over the river.
It's been rough times
for them who stuck it out.
Yeah, the war is lost.
No shit, Dutchie.
Who the gal and kid
belong to?
That's my wife.
[Chuckles]
Well, if that don't beat all.
You got a wife, Dutchie.
- Where you headed?
- Newport.
Hell, man.
There's 200 Federals in Newport.
We just rode through 'em.
You can't go on in there.
Wrong, Dutchie.
I am goin' in there.
I'm for certain
sure goin' in there.
I want a drink,
and they have drinks in Newport.
They'll kill you.
You best stay clear
out of there.
I don't think so, Dutchie.
I don't reckon I'll clear
out of where I was born.
You see,
that there was my hometown,
and I reckon I'll go on in
and have me a drink there.
Turner, you too?
They'll kill you sure.
What a horrible fate.
Oh, what a horrible fate!
Oh, boy,
you got me now, Dutchie.
Oh, boy, you got me now.
Jake.
Come on, Turner.
You gonna shoot him?
So long, boys. We'll raise
our glasses to you in Newport.
[Breathing Heavily]
All right.
It ain't right,
and it ain't wrong.
It just is.
[Sighs]
So now?
Are you certain you wanna ride
with your gun like that?
Let me wake 'em, Holt.
No, Roedel.
You let them sleep.
I ain't too much
for good-byes.
But, uh, maybe
I'll just tip my hat.
All right.
Daniel Holt.
Jakob Roedel.
