"Hey, eh...!"
The memory can never forget the beauty
of a young rump...
"Heh heh, "yeah not even after death...""
What a piece! Hey!
Such vulgarity...
Well what did you expect...
with a mother like Zaira?
And with a papa like Andre...!
Is it true that he's the father?
"Nothing is true,
and nothing is untrue..."
"Hey, Maestro!"
"Oh, hah hah..."
"I'll strangle you, you little wart!"
"Well, didn't she get here yet...?"
"No, not yet..."
"Will you stop looking at the clock,"
"you're not going to find her there,"
your obsession is unnatural...
What's wrong?
You are not happy?
'very happy... Huh...!
You bother to ask...?
"Ehh, his obsession was my obsession
at his age, heh heh..."
"Naa-naa, when we were young,"
"you fooled around with me,"
"not with a dumb poopy-doll. The likes
of her, come out of nowhere..."
"What do you mean "nowhere","
she's Zaira's daughter!
In fact... imagine a woman...
"...who worked as a hat checker in the
cloakroom of a transatlantic liner, huh!"
Well what's so bad about working
in a cloakroom?
Because she came back...
knocked-up and unmarried!
She returned with Signor Andre...
"What a pair, Zaira and Mr. Bang-a-bang!"
"Bang-a-bang, you kidding"
"...he was considered the best,
unequaled Chef the Normandie ever had!"
Listen I say what you see you believe...
and I see Signor Andre living in
Ca del Mosto sitting on his ass...
"together with a lady who acts
as his governess,"
"but is his lover, as everybody knows..."
"...and a young lass,"
"...who he treats like a daughter,"
despite the fact that her surname
is her mother's!
"Ah, 'tis the life I would lead!"
Blessed is he who can do it...
"'mmnaahh, look at you slobbering,"
"but I can tell you one thing,"
...nobody's getting our son
without my approval!
"Besides what's the hurry,
they're too young yet!"
Ehh... How about if
they've already consumed...?
"Oh yeah, well that's just too bad,"
'cause I know my son
He doesn't take after his father!
Hey... he's no fruit!
Oh you can bet on that and he's not
indecent either like you are...!
Well he is my son too... or isn't he?
"Hmmm! Ohhh! You piggy...!"
Make Waaaaaayyyyooweeee!
See you are very lucky...
What do you mean I'm lucky?
You're lucky 'cause you're fun...
"Hmmm... yeah, lots o' fun...?"
Hmmm...
So what does that mean?
'you come with me I'll show you...
Hey...
You're supposed to knead
the bread today...!
"Look I don't get paid, but you do..."
"Oh... come on, hug me...!"
My hands are full of dough
Give here...
What are you doing...?
Cleaning you what else...?
"Oh you're right, Lola, I'm so lucky..."
No... you excite me too much...
And so...?
And so first we have to get married!
"Oh, with me no and with whores yes huh?!"
"For your information,"
I don't go with those kind of women!
"Don't be wayward with me, Lola..."
or you'll make me lack respect...
"Don't be wayward with me, Lola?"
You must be an idiot!
"Listen, Masetto..."
they say virginity is only
a crumb of bread...
and the first birdie that comes along
takes it away...
In other words...?
You're just a dodo!
"You're almost naked, most of the time..."
"It's so hot,"
"What do you want me to dress
like, a nun, huh?"
Who do you think of all the time...?
"Of you, just you, all the time..."
"Oh god, y' driving me crazy..."
And I'm here waiting...
"Oh, yes..."
Signor Tommaso...
the bread too has risen!
"Should I pick you after lunch,
about 3 o'clock?"
"No, go respect somebody else..."
Shameless thing...
Talking to me...?
Could've brushed up 'little bit
"Oh, I leaned on some flour sacks..."
"Huh, I'll tell y' what you leaned on!"
I'll brush you dear...
Ouch...! Why did you hit me like that?!
Well...?
Of all the cheek!
Blessed the cheek...!
Heh... I think I prefer them headless...
bodies alone are more expressive...
and above all... they don't lie...
"Right, the quintessence of being...
Coito... ergo sum!"
"En effet, all the rest,
is nothing but, distraction..."
"No, go ahead say it,"
"an illusion, a fraud a lie,"
"no, no even worse, eh... a curse!"
"Work, success... progress..."
It's all bullshit...
"Only there... I, am...!"
Some of the credit I think is due to the
black and white...
"Eh, huh... Zaira was made for
black and white!"
I'll never forget...
first time I saw her...
It was in Le Havre...
I was already a chef on the Normandie...
and she was in charge of the cloakroom
in first class...
"Huh... - She was wearing her
black uniform,"
...White collar... black stockings...
"pure, white skin..."
A bombshell!
She was having an affair with
somebody else...
and she gave him up for me...
"She eh, sacrificed him for me..."
"And you, in exchange,"
"sacrificed travels, adventures, 'n'
straying about as you pleased... hmm"
All I gave up were today's myths
That boom of theirs will blow them up...
"When I'm out here I can laugh at all the
trouble the world's getting itself into,"
all I need is what is in my plate...
and in my bed...
"that is "la joie de vivre","
Pepe... Ca del Mosto...
your friendship...
Hmph... Zaira's derriere
And... Lola's... smile...
Must I imagine she's not
your daughter Andre...?
It is not for you to imagine...
"Ughhh! That looks sinful, Ma-ma..."
They're already blessed...
Praised be the Lord...
Praised be... - Now and forever amen
Now and forever amen
"I've something for you, dear"
"...the good Pope, John the 23rd,"
he'll always protect you...
See if the water's boiling
and check the salt...
...a little bit too salty...
For Andre nothing's too salty...
He's all salt I know...
"All right let's get a move on,
wash your hands,"
"and fix a tray with 2 plates, 2 glasses,"
a bottle of wine and four rolls...
Yeah yeah...
"Here... take it up to the Master,"
he's in the studio with Pepe...
"What's eating you, Zaire?"
Eh my daughter's no longer a child...
Praised be the Lord...
Here Padre... this is the
heel of the salami...
the prior's portion...
"Oh, the hindquarter, thank you child"
"Thank you and God bless, thank you..."
Is it true that you and Maxime
had a mistress in common...
the famous danceusce?
"Oh, she was famous all right
But not for le dance"
She once had 12 men on-the-trot
one after the other
She likes ceremonies
But Maxime was impotent; was he not?
he got her warmed up and then
I took over
"Like I said she likes cerem...
Pepe, Attenio!"
"Oh Lola, Bonjour mon petit"
What a pleasure to see you
"Bonjour, Mr. Pepe"
Mama prepared you something
to eat and drink
Mmm... the smell of baked bread!
More likely of baker boy
Incidentally how is Thomas Santou?
What do you care?
You don't have to marry him
"Well, if he makes love the way
he bakes bread...!"
You are a very lucky girl
Monsieur Pepe
Merci
Can I leave the tray here?
Or does it hinder the projector?
Leave it there. Leave it there
Thank you...
It's not the tray that's going to
blur our view...
Ah-ah... not that!
It's off limits...
I'm like Bluebeard...
every door except one
"And that, where did you get that?"
One of my old ships...
The Atalante...
It's still working...?
I think so... take a look
Help me...!
"All right, all right, come on,
come on then... hm..."
What are you doing? Put me down
"All right, you can go now..."
...run along
Take them as a present...
Come on! Let us get on
with our work...
"Yes, very delicate work...
you never know,"
you could mistake one ass for another
She's simply delightful...
She's a Charlotte Russe...
And something even more...
An unquenchable pussy of
natural talent!
'Lola...?
No! That one...
Ah! Who's that?
"A country bride, name's... Carla"
"...shameless, twat"
"Yet she lives in constant fear,"
which lends a certain licentiousness
Where did you come across her...?
"She was in Michelle's atelier
looking for a dress,"
"'t was just a candid shot,
she wasn't really posing..."
"I'll shoot her later this afternoon,"
full service in the buff...
With the hat though...
I guaranteed her that the pictures would
only be published in France...
although no Italian editor would dare
take the chance. Andre...?
You come along too...?
"Yes, of course..."
Only eh... I feel sorry for her...
Ahh... she's going to be disappointed...
what we want from her... is far less
than she's willing to give
You do me a favor if you come
Oddly enough...
Michelle is rather jealous when I'm
alone among such models...
"Well, you know women,"
always trying to turn you
into someone else...
that's why every now and then I have to
make it very clear...
that I will continue to ehh... give
free rein... to the rest of my desires
"Bravo Andre,"
"show everyone that "toi c'est toi...""
and that it's their choice whether to
take you or leave you
"Merci, mon ami, I'll walk with you..."
it's a beautiful day!
...Betrothed...
Unbetrothed...
And what if someone came
walking through?
He'll enjoy the view...
The Normandie was a
floating house of pleasure...
And what pleasure!
"There, there, there..."
"Ahh, now it's as pink as a rose"
"Ahh, I like that"
"Yes, lovely"
"Pepe, prepare her!"
Pepe...
"I, have finished..."
Our trophy is up for the bidding...
I shall be the first...
And then the others will all join in
How many others...?
Twelve...
"As you wish "mon amour, mon chef!""
Sante... Merci...
Eleven to go...
"I could turn that bakery into
something you wouldn't believe,"
"a big, modern money-making factory..."
Quiet! Ch-ch-ch...
"Eh th-th-th There... there...
Don't make noise, quiet!"
"The-they're the, Cavaliers,
cavaliers of Italy, hey!"
"I really don't see any Cavaliers,"
A couple of twats maybe
"He who sees sees huh! He who sees sees!
The Cavaliers of Italy..."
He's nutty...
They call them Gildo the Voyeur
Everybody knows him...
What's a voyeur...?
"It's somebody who gets his rocks off
spying on you,"
like those Italian Cavaliers there...
Well who are the Cavaliers of Italy...?
They're our dickey-birds...
...cavaliers... He keeps
going peek-a-boo...
"Oh, he doesn't hurt anybody,"
he just looks that's all...
"Like I was saying,"
"I want to set up a factory, real modern,"
"for the mass-production of breadstick,"
"sandwich-bread and fresh egg noodles,"
for export mostly in Germany...
"And raise laying hens,"
"mass-production eggs for our noodles,"
"automatic heaters and automatic feeders,"
"'got so many things in mind
we can do together, Lola..."
And I have only one!
"Let's get outta her, that nut's there"
So what...
' doesn't seem to bother anyone...
didn't you say he just watches...
"I want you, Tommaso"
"Take me Tommaso, now! - Ohh!"
"Do what you have to do whatta you
waiting for, Tommaso?!"
What I'm waiting for is for us to get married!
"Look he's not waiting, poor thing,
you're cruel. You're gonna make him cry"
Get your bloomers back on...!
"No, I'll do nothing of the sort,"
not before you avoid respecting me...
Avoid...?
"Rape me, screw me, do me!"
Are you crazy...
"...only a few days before our wedding,"
n' you want to ruin it all...
Don't worry it's not gonna get ruined
"What if I don't like you,"
and it's all wrong...
"One must experiment before the wedding,"
"I have to know beforehand,
and make sure that you love me, ahh..."
You want to be sure of my love?
My respecting you is the
very proof of it
"You're being silly, Lola,
you're talking nonsense!"
"I want an apology, Lola..."
An apology?!
"Where do you think you are,
in a tearoom or something?"
I know what you got spinning your head
"You're worried I'm gonna betray you,"
and put the horns on you
"Which is what you deserve probably,"
you think virginity...
is an insurance policy against
your getting the horns!
The poor boy...
"I could put horns on you before
and after our marriage,"
just like that!
"Faggot! Go on, go marry
your noodle factory!"
"Come back, Lola, where are you going?"
To find somebody who's less of a jerk
than you are!
"A virgin, ole..."
Is there anyone willing
not to respect me...?
Come back here
"Hey you, Voyeur..."
What's going on...?
I scared him too
"No, you what you should
listen to me... Hmm?"
Stupid...
...so stupid... Let go...
...You're right I'm pretty stupid
Oh the dressmaker! I had an
appointment at five...
"Don't worry, we'll make it..."
"Sonia, come"
...it's so nice here
Come...
"Get the damn thing started,"
"I don't wanna get there too late,"
for my bridal gown I'm supposed to
try it on...
"What's the point in going, if you're
not gonna marry me anymore?"
You can go fly a kite while I marry
somebody that I like...
What the hell is the matter with this
all of a sudden?!
"Look if you don't hurry,"
you're gonna bleed to death
before I get to the dressmaker...
"Yeah well you better get out
and get my handkerchief,"
...in my side-pocket...
I don't feel any handkerchief...
There's really nothing much in there...
Shuttup
Not very much...
"Put anything on it,
a strip of your blouse,"
"your skirt, whatever!"
Wait a minute...
Don't worry...
Hold still...
"The juices of women are a potent,
and immediate disinfectant..."
Wow! You're really too much for me...
"Well, it's true..."
"What goes on in that little head
of yours anyway, huh?"
Only because today is Easter...
It's the last time I'm going to step in
I just find it inhibiting...
What is this disgust?
I'm surprised at your repression!
"Knowing how talented your finger is!
Ow, ahhh, goddamn bird..."
what've you been eating?! -Ahh...
"Let me take care of it,"
give here...
"What are you tugging there, stupid...?!"
You'd like me to have one like that
wouldn't you...?
"It's late, come on!"
"Oh, just barely in time..."
"Hey, wait up..."
"Can't we go together, slow down?"
"You crazy,"
"Showing the gown to the groom,"
"spells a marriage of ill-fated doom""
Watch out with your dressmaker huh?
A french seamstress who whores
on the side...
that can get kinda heady
"She can influence you,
don't forget that, Lola!"
Shut up!
How I could fall in love
with an idiot like that!
I'd be waiting at the bar
"All of a sudden it rains,"
"what weather, look at it..."
"Unpredictable like women, yeah, 'eah..."
"Un moment, j'arrive... mon Dieu"
"Oh it's you, cherie..."
I was about to call you...
"I'm sorry I'm late, Madame,"
it started to rain and I was on a...
"Yes-yes-yes, all right, come along"
"Huh, with lightning too"
Voila...
"Ooohh how beautiful,
a work of art Madame..."
"Yes it's coming along well,
undress and try it on"
Yeah...
Ehhh... I'm afraid it's not possible
Et pourquoi?
Don't have any panties
What...?
"You lost them by accident, cherie?"
"Well, in a way..."
it was an emergency
"Oh, je comprend..."
at your age it's very common
"and it happens often,"
Oh but I have what you need...
So you undress and I'd be right back
"Hurry, vite, vite..."
"Vite, vite? Ou'est-ce qu' il y a?
...Pourquois?"
Go on...
Here we are... these come from Paris...
they are trimmed with lace...
tre's chic cherie
Thank you Madame Michelle...
You'll have them tomorrow
"Oh no no, you can keep them, darling"
It will be my wedding gift
"This is a lovely gown, dear..."
But I think you look best...
When you are in the nude
"Well, I can't go to church
with just a veil..."
What a shame...
You're perfect as it...
"There are men who I know, cherie..."
who would... pay a fortune for a girl...
"...like you are, dear"
Might you be virgin...?
"Yeah, I feel like a dope..."
You said that they would pay a lot...
"Beaucoup, beaucoup d'argent..."
So many girls sit on a fortune
without even knowing it
"lmagine, there's a gentleman I know
who is ready to pay an enormous sum,"
"just to be near you... and admire you,"
...in total respect...
"Oh, no. It's a mania,"
ooohhh... in total respect!
"No, dear Michelle,"
"I thank you,"
but love's a lot of fun...!
And if it isn't I don' wanna do it...
Oh... excuse me a minute...
Madame Carla...?
Good evening
"...and how are you, Michelle?"
Through there...
Thank you
Silly tarts
Oh mon chou... you're a veritable angel
What... your husband Madame Michelle...
What kind of photos does he do?
"Photos of art, my dear..."
But models in Italy have no class
"Paris is another world, plus chic!"
Ahhh... Then why didn't you stay
where you were?
For many reasons... my dear
...la guerre... politics...
"And Cinema, the movies,"
I worked in wardrobe
and he was cameraman...
But that was a long time ago...
"Voila... Perfection... not yet,"
You are missing the veil...
No moving... you're full of pins
...they hurt
"I accepted only because they're
artistic photos, Signor Andre..."
"But of course, Signora Carla...
eh, artistic, and... poetic!"
Don't squeeze your legs together then...
Now lift your slip...
Very good
Lean forward...
...it has got to stick out
The highlight!
"We've just met,"
I naturally wouldn't want you to
think badly of me
"On the contrary, I think very
highly of you, Signora Carla..."
"Oh... pardon, I was looking for a veil',"
"Carla, you are worthy of D'Annunzio..."
Am I pretty...?
Hmmm... a... bijou
D'Annunzio...
Here you are darling
"And your veil, you like it?"
I dunno...
It's a veil...
"What's the matter, dear..."
Are you upset?
"Oh, it's nothing..."
"could be because the day is gloomy,"
and that we're in the dark...
"It often happens the first time
you put on a wedding gown,"
"but you get over it,"
"it's just a bit of, "cafardness""
Huh? Bit of ca'...?
"En francais you say "cafard""
"Ahh, I know that's "melancholy","
Andre says that to Mama when she's sad
Oui... you're melancholy and sad?
"No, I'm not sad, it's only that..."
"Only that, it itches like hell!"
"Oh bravo, Lola"
"when it itches it itches,"
which of course has nothing to do
with your being a bride
'pretty long time...
I took the time it took...
Did it come out right?
Hmmm...
Wanna drink or something?
Hmmm... Marsala wine...
That's pretty strong...
"Too bad, I feel like Marsala..."
One Marsala
"Look, what a nice wedding gift
I got from Madame Michelle"
Cover up!
Why?
They're looking at you...
Well it's too bad
"Ohhh... you're staring at the girl,"
you're gonna get the guy all riled up...
So whatta y' worried about...
It's not like we were back in Palermo...
we're up North...
"They're nice, they don't get offended,"
when you happen to look at their broads
Sit like a lady or there'll be trouble
"Ooph, Tommaso you're such a bore..."
"Oy-yo-yo-yo, I'm dying, she's crazy..."
Now the fun starts...
"Come on Lola, let's get outta here!"
I'm not going anywhere
What do you mean?
No! ...besides it's raining...
I gotta go to the John too
If you need help...
I'm at your disposal
Got him right on the beak...
You deserved it
"Look, he's starting to get angry"
What the...
That's enough now...
Whatta you crazy or something...?!
You're coming with me!
Watch your manners
"Let go of me,"
who do you think you are anyway?!
And you dance with me from now on!
We made the North jealous...
"You fucking Bedouin,
I'll bust your head in!"
Get your hands off of him
"Hold him, hold him, we'll giv'm a lesson"
Bash his head and see if it scores...
"On the pinball? Hey, not on the machine"
"I don't have to marry you,"
I'm free-free to do as I damn please
"Yeah, I wish I were too..."
Good-bye
"Break, break..."
That's enough!
"Miss, Hey Miss... hop in
I'll give you a lift"
I will go where you go...
wherever that is...
"Come on, hop in"
"What are you afraid of, I'm a gentleman"
"I am, can't you tell...?"
"Oh, c'mon Miss get in the car..."
Lola!
Lola...
"Get in, let's go!"
Lolaaa!
"Now, now..."
"No Lola, where you going..."
How'd it go? You lost your gadget?
What gadget?
"With the dude who was hollering
like he had a fever,"
you're Lola huh?
Lola...?
No...
Oh really...?
My name is Zaira...
"Zaira, it's a pleasure,"
"you are talking to Lenzi Remo
the furrier,"
"absolute best furrier in the business,"
A- Number-one
Would you like to take a peak?
Go ahead...
feel how lush they are...
You got a pretty good chassis
there Zaira...
You ever think of modelling?
You'd look great in a mink coat...
How about a little music...?
"That's it, relax honey,"
"then you'll tell me
where you have to go, huh?"
"Maybe you want me to,
close the window...?"
"Ehh... no don't close it,"
I need the air and the rain drops...
What are you afraid of?
"Zilch, o' nobody, nothing..."
"Yeah, you're a winner... Ohh"
...every little bit...
Whatta bush...
"I get your fur, Zaira,"
"and you're gonna get all of mine,"
fair exchange huh...
"Oh, more, even more...
You are "la joie... de vivre...!""
Formidable... A dream...
in black and white
What the hell are you doing?
Where am I anyway?!
"You're with me honey, take it easy"
Let go. I wanna get outta here...
Oh c'mon...
"You come in my car without any panties,"
and then all of a sudden you wanna
turn me into a sucker or something?
"I don't have to turn you,
you already are!"
"Ah, so pussy's being sarcastic,"
"Well I'll teach you a lesson
you'll never forget,"
"Come here, Miss no panties..."
"Get ya filthy hands, Hmmm!"
"Ohhhh... Ahhhh... you bitch,
you crazy or something"
"You wanna get hit smart ass,"
"here, now stop it!"
You wiggle your ass then you do
virgin martyr bit?
"Zaira, you know what you are, huh,
Zaira you know what?"
"A hunk o' tail, a hooker, yeah..."
"Where the hell do you think
you are going, Chippy..."
"Where the fuck do you think, Ahh,"
"...no you don't, gimme a piece of that!"
"Ahhhhh, you cunt you, right in the
soft parts, right in the nuts..."
I'll get you yet...
Oh yeah...?!
"Then come on out, I dare you...!"
That's not fairplay... not fairplay
...it's not...
"Coming, coming..."
It's your Masetto...
"Well, don't keep him waiting"
Enter dear
Ahh... a splendid book
"Here's someone who finally says
loud and clear,"
"that they shouldn't
close down the house,"
"and that as a result,"
Society ladies are now
putting out for free
That bitchy senator...
it's all on account of her...
She's probably doin' it for nothing...
"I didn't come here for any senator,"
It's you I come for
"Heyyy... look at you,"
you'd think you were shipwrecked...
"Got in a brawl, huh?"
...you can tell me...
"Look I came here to get laid,
not to fuck around..."
"Yeah well, before you start tootsie,"
"let's dry you up a little, huh?"
"Relax now, take it easy"
Your Wilma's here with you
"...good boy, you dry your hair now..."
Let's hope you didn't drench
your money too
"Ah, let go I'll do it... Hmm?"
"So, what happened to your finger?"
Need a new bandage?
It's coming apart...
See... I'll do it for you
What... wha' did you use it
as a Band-Aid?
"Ah I'amour, I'amour..."
"She must really be in love with you,"
if she's ready to give up
her panties for you
"So tell me what did you fight over,"
another of your ugly jealous rows?
"None of your business what I do,"
I'm here to get laid...
No you are frustrated...
...and I got to be your scapegoat
"With the houses closed,
everybody get his on the run,"
no longer any room for foreplay...
"In the old sporting houses I heard say
girls conversed a lot with the clients,"
joked and sang...
It was a question of principle!
For me it was...
A question of principle for fuck?
My poor little Tomasetto...
Shut up...
Here... slip it on...
"You're always... so exciting, Masetto,"
Come...
So... how do you want me...?
"Yes darling, do what you want..."
...and don't think about her
making you angry
"Come, come, get on me..."
"Jump on me,"
kiss me if you like... ohhh...
"Yes, I'm ready,"
You're driving me crazy...
This is how you have to screw
that dumb twat of yours...
"Shut up, don't talk..."
"Forgive me, I won't talk,"
let's just enjoy!
"I'm the dumb twat,"
"...not her,"
"just me, just me!!"
Lola
"Tell me something, Wilma..."
Why is Lola so spiteful?
"Oh, sweet boy... you should know..."
...that love is all a spite...
Hmph! What happened to you?
Ah caught in a rainstorm...
Aren't you up early?
Was getting ready to go out hunting...
Pepe's coming by later...
And Mama...?
Upstairs... asleep...
Yeah...
Dry yourself...
you'll catch your death...
Here...
"Gotta take these off first,
they're so sopping"
Then hang it in front of me
if it bothers you
What's the matter?
"You're the father you say you are,"
aren't you...?
"All done, you can dry me now..."
Finished?
Is something missing? It's all I got...
"Well, what happened, did you eh...
Have a fight with Tommaso?"
It's over with him...
Ahhh... Go on. What happened?
The usual...
he's your opposite...
"With him there's no kidding,"
"no fooling around, no dreaming..."
"He keep's saying: no, no, no as usual"
"He's always making a scene,"
"he's jealous of anybody,"
I say hello to...
Even of my father...
Hmph... Maybe he's right
You can't lock up la joie de vivre...
Or could he be wrong...
Do you love him?
I don't know...
There are two Lolas...
One wants Masetto...
and the other...
Dry yourself...
"Here... drink this, it'll do you good"
"Hey, what is that?"
Find me a dress that's dry
Look inside my room
Not even please...?
Why don't you go and fetch it yourself?
Because if I go...
Who knows if I'll return?
What are you looking at...?
"The moon, it's so white"
Yeah... So am I...
And... elle est belle...!
Like a posed photograph...?
Oh better... Like a woman!
"Right, that's enough, get dressed"
"No, you dress me"
"Come here... here put this on, here"
How'd you find this one?
I just followed my nose...
"I can just see you snooping around
in my room,"
"when I'm not there, huh?"
And you come snooping around...
even when I'm here
"You're still going to marry
Tommaso, huh?"
"No, not anymore..."
Then you can carry on making him jealous
"I'm not marrying Tommaso,"
...you wanna bet?
Easy... Bet what...?
Me...
"Don't joke, baby girl"
"No, it's a fact..."
"Though I'm promised to Tommaso,"
"it is you who are, luring me away..."
Don't talk foolishly... I'm your father
"Well are you... or, aren't you?"
Andre! Lola!
You little slut! Dirty slut!
"All right, all right Zaira, all right,
nothing happened!"
The wench!
Look who's talking?
"I saw your sleazy bordello photographs,"
...congratulations!
"I can accept the others,
but not my daughter!"
"Dirty lech, you turned her
into your lover, huh?"
"Admit it,"
"I want to know, I want to know!"
"What's there to know,"
"you jealous idiot,"
"she came in here soaked to the skin,"
and I helped to dry her!
"That is all, that is all..."
Now I want to know everything from you
Everything what...?
And this time...
I want the truth...
Is Lola my daughter...?
"Got it on your mind, huh?"
"She could've been your daughter,"
but you preferred her to be mine!
"...and I played along,"
"letting you live in the doubt,"
"a doubt that would protect her,"
"...while saving our own love,"
"but nothing will stop you, nothing!"
"Because your libido is so perverted
that instead of showing restraint,"
"'cause she's your daughter,
it excited you,"
you pig...!
Lola's father is Jean...
"Go on, take another swat at me..."
Good ole Jean...
your machinist friend on the Normandie
"Ehh, he introduced us..."
...he was my lover
And you knew it all along
Lola was already on her way
before I met you...
...it was that pig's good-bye present
Nice huh?
You pig...
"...and now that you know
Lola's not your daughter,"
"run to her, go ahead, go ahead,
run to h'..."
"No no, it's not true, no, no..."
You know I could never love
anybody but you...
"You are a pig no, a pig, a pig,
pig-pig, you're a pig"
"No, no, no, no..."
"Can't you feel me? Ahhh,"
feel the way I love you...
Yes... yes...
"I sense you love yer,"
it's she you want...
"No, no-no-no..."
You know that's not true...
"No, that's for you, for you"
No...
No woman has ever excited me the way...
"Yes, you excite me so quickly..."
"No, no, I saw you..."
You didn't see anything
You know... there's only you
I could never love anybody...
...the way I love you...
You pig!
"Yes... Bite me,"
yes... Bite me!
"Will you shuttup, ballbreaker!"
What's wrong you don't like the song?
"No, and you neither..."
"Well, what's to look at?"
The rolls aren't done yet?
"Huh...? Obviously not if I closed
the oven, stupid!"
It's strange...
...according to the clock
they should be out
Oh really!
"You're gonna tell me how to run
a bakery now, are you?"
"Look if you can't get your
rocks off with Lola,"
...don't take it out on me
...son of a bitch!
Listen sweet pea...
"you just mention Lola's name
and you're dead,"
...is that clear?!
Yeah loud and clear...
mustn't name... uh huh
"Clear my ass,"
you pud puller!
"That's the end of you,
you little cream puff!"
"The bread, the bread's burning!
What?"
Hurry hurry
Stupid... look what you did?
"Ahhh... what "l" did?"
Maseetttooooo!!
Anything else?
Some fresh buns...
"Ahh, I'm sorry..."
"but the hand-rolled bread is gonna take
a little longer, Signora..."
"Really, why ever...?"
"Ah, it's the whimsy of ovens..."
"...and of bakers,"
whose thoughts are far from their work
"You're being unjust,"
"come on, they're about to get hooked"
Unfortunately... The girl's a
tropical disease which is incurable
"Yours son's marrying the disease,
not you,"
and he's probably immune...
'better pray the girl doesn't take after
that whoremongering Signor Andre...
"Oh, you're talking of a future in-law..."
In-law of that scoundrel?
"If I learn that Lola is officially
Signor Andre's daughter,"
...you can be sure
she'll not marry Masetto!
Good morning!
"How you doin' Lola, the usual?"
"No, today no bread,"
...just Masetto
"You just stay outta there, you hear!"
"Eh, he's got a supplementary
batch to do,"
don't distract him sweetie...
Hah
Hmm... 'they burned the bread
by chance...?
Will you just look at her...! Hmph!
Hi... You burned the bread huh?
"Don't get cheeky,"
Iook at the way she shows up!
"Well, as far as that goes,
you look like a pretzel"
"Every minute of the day you're jealous,"
"you in that bar with those
soldiers and all,"
and then you ordering me to get into
the car of that awful man
I ordered you to get in the car
with that man?
"'was you're doing yeah on account of
your sick jealous phobia,"
"'nd you wanna know what
took place in there,"
...want the details...?
Go on...!
Poor Tomasetto...
"Don't gimme that shit, talk... Go on!"
I was forced to consent!
Forced to conse'...
"One word outta you, you're dead,"
...mind the ovens!
Take that!
"What's all this bullshit,"
"if it's true I'll strangle you,
you little bitch..."
"...talk, go ahead talk, go on!"
"I was forsaken, forsaken..."
What the fuck does that mean...?
I took a back alley the minute
I got into his car
"The pervert finally parks,"
"and I'm sitting there like a goose,"
then all of a sudden... he notices
I don't have any panties
"I did everything to break away,"
"but he, he, he... jumped on top of me,"
and tied my arms and legs...
"Then I called out, called out to you,"
"oh how I called out to you, Masetto,"
...you'll never know
I was forsaken...!
And...
"And I said you mustn't, you mustn't..."
"to a virgin girl, no you mustn't
I am a virgin..."
But all he did... was to spread me
with all the force he had...
and unleashed his libido...
"Oh c'mon, spit it out, what did he do?!"
"He took his dick out and
slipped inside me,"
"you got it, lunkhead?"
"He took my cherry is what he did,"
my virginity and...
...it's all your fault! Hmph!
That's a lotta crap. You made the
whole thing up. I know you...
"Instead it happened, it happened,"
"...and if you don't believe it,
take a look!"
What?
Take a look at what?
"What's to look at, you little slut,"
"I'll give you something to look at,"
"here, you slut, you cunt, you wench,
wench, wench, wench..."
"Slut, ahh..."
"Yeah, slut, cunt, horny little wench!"
"Ah deflower me, deflower me..."
"You lied to me, you lied...
why'd you lie?"
You liar...
Tell me why you made up
all that baloney...?
To help you take the initiative...
give me a towel or something
I'm such a mess...
"Here, take this. It's clean"
We use it to cover the dough
to help it rise...
"It's just what I need,"
"especially now, I could start
getting big all of a sudden"
Doesn't matter...
we'll just tell the dressmaker to
hurry up and finish your gown...
I love you-loveyou-love you
Hey hussy... what's your cock doing here?
The poor thing's in mourning...
Of all the lovelies gathered
in our midst...
there's but one who heads the list:
who else... but Lola!
"If you're tired, my young baker,
rest up tonight,"
...and let me take her!
"Give me one too! Yoohoo, give me one too"
Coming dear... Hmmm?!
Here... take this... take it...!
Hmmm... Eh my conjugal duties require...
that I uphold my husband's offer...
"A toast to our first night, Monsieur..."
"I'm bursting, so full, careful it's
holding me up, careful no, you idiot!"
"It's yours Boss, Wow!"
I've never seen one of those...
"'Give the bride a buss, lad!
Buss the buss the bride..."
"A buss, a buss..."
"Buss the bride, buss the bride...
buss the bride"
"You been bawling since we
left the church,"
let's kiss and be c'mon gimme a...
I have to do something
it won't take long
Pee pee...?
And...
Whatta y' mean and? Startin' in again?
"Ah, ah... Y'r not to ask questions,"
wait and I'll tell you...
They've never seen such a wedding
in these parts...
And you couldn't have done more
had she been your daughter
"Yes, I think it's all gone
wonderfully well, my darling..."
"But I better go check the wedding cake,"
la piece de resistance! - Excusez- Moi
"All right Zaire, let's have one,
you kissing the groom! Go ahead..."
They say there are only three things
in the world that leave no traces...
a gull high up in the air...
a halibut in the ocean...
And a cock inside a pussy
...yeah that's my Wilma...
"We thank the Lord for womanhood,"
"we thank the Lord we think it's good,"
"and I, a friar..."
"I touch one there and whoops,
I feel it here!"
And tomorrow we shall all be penitent...
"Oh stop your moaning, Agnes,
for goodness sake,"
"eat up the good food,"
and tonight I'll do you...
Not here...
Ahhhh... I ehh... I have
a present for you...
And I too...
Only you mustn't tell anybody
else though...
It has to be our little secret...
Like mine...
"I, declare you... a member... of my club"
"Oh, Andre... It's stupendous!"
"All right, all right...
Now what about my present?"
As you know... you were right
I married Tommaso...
and so... I lost the bet
"You won, Andre... and I, have to pay"
"...Must stop, stop!"
You're making a mistake...
I'd like to give you a souvenir
to remember me by
"Here, look... you have every right...
You won!"
"Ohhhh... Lola, I... I've never met
anybody like you..."
Nor I like you...
I am a very lucky man...
"Didn't you know that whomever
gives me pleasure,"
...is surely lucky... huh?
"The bride, we want the bride"
"Get your bride, son before I do:"
we want the bride!
"We want the bride, we want the bride..."
You okay...
Are we ready...?
"Kiss her, Masetto"
"Buss the bride, Buss the bride..."
"buss the bride, buss the bride,
buss the bride"
"Buss the bride, buss the bride,
buss the bride"
"Hmmm - Come on, let's dance!"
"Think it'll last,"
...or there'll be cheating?
Her on him or him on her?
It works both ways...
They're wild about each other...
that's all that matters...
What does fidelity have to do
with living?
Hmm... everything...
"No-no-no, it doesn't...
It has nothing to do with it..."
"It does, it does..."
Look what a nice gift I got from Andre?
"Oh it's beautiful,"
are you wearing the
dressmaker's gift too...?
"No, no panties...!"
"What do you mean, "no panties"...?"
"I removed two things, my panties
and the veil when I went upstairs,"
...they made me itchy...
You're always itchy...
Yup!
"Be on the level, Lola..."
So long as you don't ask...
I'll always be on the level
Don't tell me you're still jealous
now that we're married...
Above all now...!
You feel sorry for having done it?
"Well, I'm not so sure...
it's the first time I get maried"
You mean you're already
thinking of cheating...?
Well-I'm not so sure...
it's the first time I get married
