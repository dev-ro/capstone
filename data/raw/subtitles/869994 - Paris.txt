Khadija!
Do you ever wonder
where these wires come from?
No, I never wonder about that stuff.
Well, I wonder.
And where do they go?
- Where is it?
- There.
- The Pantheon?
- Montparnasse Tower?
- The Pantheon?
- No, Montparnasse.
There.
- The Pantheon?
- The universe!
And the muniverse?
The muniverse?
The muniverse is tired.
Where is the universe?
- Mom!
- Where is it?
Everywhere.
The universe is everywhere.
Hello.
Lift your head.
Don't forget your feet.
Your head, sweetie.
At the same time.
There you go! That's it.
That's the center of the heart.
The heart's heart, if you like.
If I zoom in too close,
we can't see much.
Your heartbeat's regular.
The treatment seems to be helping.
But...
But?
But what?
I don't want to see the foliage.
Hide the foliage.
Hello!
There! Now the mushrooms.
That's what makes it look
like autumn.
I don't want to see...
What a ninny! Unbelievable!
There!
Now fan out the bouquet a little.
- Hello! Feeling better?
- Yes, thank you.
Solène, you had a customer!
Passionate Paris.
Party Paris. Singing Paris.
Heartfelt Paris.
But also working Paris.
Commuting Paris.
Ritzy, shabby, trashy Paris.
Paris, you have a thousand faces.
Paris, who are you?
The capitail abounds in...
Shit!
- Ca-pi-tal!
- Cut!
Give it a rest, Lorenzo.
This is Roland Verneuil.
I can't make it.
I'm sorry this is so last minute
but I'm kind of tied up.
Nothing serious, I hope.
Well, sort of.
I have a burial to go to.
Oh, I see.
I hope it isn't anyone too close.
Well, yes.
In fact... it's my father.
What can I say?
Nothing. He's dead, that's it.
I'm just sorry
to cancel our meeting, yet again.
You're like some old geezer!
Get some exercise!
Can't those jerks fix the elevator!
I swear!
They just put in a new one...
When was it?
Two years ago?
- Two years.
- This younger generation!
In shambles before their time.
Dad!
Come on.
Pull yourself together. Shit!
He was 95 years old.
That's some score!
He died peacefully.
It's not as though... Come on!
It's hard to leave him.
Come on...
A nice bowl of soup,
a little blow job from Mélanie...
You'll see.
You're dumb!
What's your name, girly?
Let me go!
What did you do?
- Did you whistle at me?
- No, I...
Like I'm some mutt?
No, sorry, ma'am.
Fuck! Beat it, asshole!
So?
- What is it?
- Come in.
You sounded weird on the phone.
Well, I...
I'm sick.
It's a heart thing.
My days may be numbered.
They're not too optimistic.
I may need a heart transplant.
Even then I may not pull through.
They say 50% but...
I guess that means
a 40% success rate.
What does that mean,
a 40% success rate?
Well, 40% means
a 60% chance it won't work,
that it'll be useless.
You know, I feel like
it's barely started and now...
How long have you known?
It started 3 months ago.
It took me a month
to go to a doctor.
Then all the tests and everything...
I've known for a month.
Why didn't you say anything?
Because... I don't know.
We haven't seen each other
in a long time. And...
- I don't wanna tell everyone.
- I'm not everyone.
Right! Your sister, your family...
you don't give a shit!
- Fuck!
- There! That's it!
What, "That's it?" That's what?
I may die,
I tell you...
and you fucking yell at me.
I'm sorry. Shit!
And Mom and Dad?
Have you told them?
No. I can't tell Mom and Dad.
Can you imagine?
Okay, so how do you...
live? Moneywise?
I live on
the little money I have left but...
- That's running out.
- I'll take care of that.
You're all alone here?
How do you spend your days?
I watch a little TV
but that's pretty boring.
I've started gardening.
I plant stuff.
What blows my mind most
is looking out the window.
- Meaning?
- I watch other people live.
I wonder who they are,
where they go?
They become the heroes
of my little stories.
I like that.
It's not much, but...
frankly, it keeps me going.
Here's your change, sir.
Thank you. Have a nice day.
- Hi.
- Hi, Lauryn.
How are you?
Oh, you're Lauryn's mom?
I'm Simone's mom.
I saw you at school.
Oh, yeah! Right, Simone.
Lauryn's always talking about her.
Simone's the one
who doesn't know her father.
Yes. You told me that.
So, I'll take a kilo of apples.
Okay, a kilo of apples!
This one's a real beauty, isn't it?
Yes, fine.
I'll even cut you a deal.
- What?
- A special deal
- 'cause you're so pretty.
- That's nice.
Careful, he's a Don Juan!
But he hates caviar.
Peddle your bananas
and leave me alone.
I do what I want.
I'm warning the lady.
Cut it out with Franky.
Wanna go for a drink?
Me?
I guess not!
You're not into that?
Happy? I do what I want, too.
Anything else?
Pull it with your left hand
then a quarter turn.
Didn't you make knots in school?
This is really incredible!
Hello!
I can't keep you on,
if this keeps up.
- Madam.
- A baguette, please.
- A "tradition"?
- No, a normal one.
They say to hire young people
but kids don't want to work
these days.
- It's only my second day.
- Right!
It wasn't like that in my day!
- Thank you.
- Thank you so, so much.
Oh, I forgot to tell you...
Simone's best friend's mother
works at the market.
Oh?
Crazy, huh!
This place is a mess!
Why do guys live in such pigsties?
Are you forced to leave
these disgusting... I don't get it!
Shit, don't dump
all your guy problems on me!
If you don't feel like doing
that stuff, don't feel obligated.
I don't feel obligated
but I feel obligated to clean.
It stinks. Really!
Mamé.
Benoît!
Miss! Miss!
Do you like flowers?
Fuck off!
Bernard, she's for you!
She's your "style!"
- No way.
- Leave the girls alone!
Nothing better to do?
You jealous or what?
Of who? Her? Jealous of her?
No! Sometimes I'm jealous of me.
Know what I mean?
I think, "Boy, am I lucky to be me."
I see myself and think,
"What a fuckin' babe!"
Then I realize...
"Hey! That babe is me!"
I don't have to be jealous.
If you get my drift.
I get it. What a saleswoman!
You can sell anybody anything!
You want me to sell you something?
Okay, Caroline,
do you mind if we go to work?
See ya.
Caroline,
this is your last week with us.
- Jealous?
- No.
We separated a year ago.
Flirt if you like.
But I don't have to watch that shit.
Chill out. I'll be outta here soon.
Hello.
Did you do your hair with dynamite?
- A head of lettuce.
- The lettuce...
Like you,
they're not too pretty today.
Thanks.
Take some avocados.
From Cameroon - beautiful, round.
They'll put color in your cheeks!
- How much?
- 7,000.
7,000?
- Too much.
- That's the best price.
- I'll give you 5,000.
- 6,000.
- Five.
- Six.
I came to say goodbye.
I'm not working here anymore.
- You lost your job?
- Yes. That happens here.
We'll miss you.
Me, too.
If you still plan to come to France...
- I'll leave my number.
- That's nice. Thanks.
- Call me, if you come!
- I will. If I come, that is.
Bye.
So you're... How many are you?
Two adults and four children.
My brother's coming
from Cameroon soon.
Then there'll be
three adults in the house.
You absolutely must find
those pay slips...
Excuse me, if you want my help...
Without those pay slips,
you can't get any subsidies.
What month was that for?
You're only missing two!
I'm missing two pay slips.
Have you looked everywhere?
All the documents are there.
Yes, but you're missing some.
- What's the problem?
- It's my brother.
He was supposed to arrive a while ago.
She's getting impatient.
Try to be on time
for these meetings!
Sorry.
Before we move on
to general business,
Elise has a personal announcement.
Over the next few months,
I need some time for myself.
So if I could go on half-time
or even 4/5-time,
that would help me out.
Have you spoken to Diedrich?
- Not yet.
- He'll never agree.
- Not now!
- You say time "for you."
What does that mean?
Well, it means...
"for me."
I need to spend time at home.
You okay, there, "Marie-Antoinette"?
Just great!
I'm buying tons of evening gowns
to waltz around the Hall of Mirrors.
Take it easy!
Hearing you say "time for myself..."
I need time for myself, too.
We all do.
- Look at Suzini!
- What, Suzini?
You need time for yourself, too!
- I don't give a damn about myself.
- That's what I meant.
I need some time for myself!
I think I do enough
for everyone else here.
I'm not gonna tell my life story.
I mean,
I'm just asking for a little solidarity
for a short time.
Your life is your life.
Your problems don't interest me.
But I remind you,
you're an elected representative.
Yeah, that I know.
And you wanna leave now,
during negotiations.
I know. It's a drag but...
I can't carry out those responsibilities
during this period.
You just think of yourself!
- I'd love that.
- Thanks.
It's always been like that in Paris.
The common opinion
that there's an old Paris
and a modernity
that's brutally struggling
to destroy and deface it
is completely false.
An ancient city
continually recreates its modernity
out of this conflict
between the old and the new.
I'll be frank with you.
I'm very torn.
The very idea of popularization
depresses me completely.
I'm not sure we do any great service
to history,
or the audience,
by democratizing everything.
It's not some expert's caprice.
When I watch
those educational programs
on the national networks
with my colleagues elucidating
on Louis XVI,
the Commune, the French Revolution,
the history of World War II...
I'm not sure they're of much use.
I understand your reticence.
For a great historian like you...
Don't start! You think,
"He's not buying this shit,
I'll butter him up!"
No, not at all. You're mistaken.
Don't wear yourself out.
I'll think it over.
It's in your hands.
Not to "butter you up"
but there aren't many great historians
with a Paris specialty.
Just out of curiosity,
how much do these things pay?
Somewhere in the neighborhood
of 100,000 euros minimum.
Of course, on top of that,
there are points.
All these people
visit the Palais Royal.
Everyone has a curiosity
about our heritage.
Everyone has a right
to your vast knowledge.
Why wouldn't they?
It's appalling
what I'm about to say...
but I'll do it.
French researchers mostly research
how to make ends meet.
Whatever your motivation,
I'd be thrilled.
And not just me. The public, too.
All these people who...
All I know about Paris,
I offer to you,
ladies and gentlemen.
Everything I know shall be yours.
Verneuil...
I have something to tell you.
I'm giving a "Merovingian Update"
at the colloquium.
What I've got on Pepin the Short
and the Carolingians
will bring the house down!
You're coming?
I'm not sure. I have a new job.
Oh! I got hold of some coins
in Angoulême
that completely contradict
the theory of direct taxation
under Dagobert! Yes, sir!
Remember my old professor, Vignard?
The thesis advisor
who liked you so much.
I don't want to become Vignard.
He's become this hideous old fossil,
rambling on about stuff
that interests nobody.
I feel like, if I go on like this,
giving my little courses,
skulking around libraries,
consulting absurd archives,
I'm doomed
to become Vignard - a rat!
A rat!
Maybe it's naïve, but
I've always thought knowledge
was about opening the mind,
a kind of awakening.
But Vignard scares me.
I'm afraid of his obsession
with historical minutia,
his maniacal, obsessive side.
These days,
everything seems pathetic to me.
You ought to take up squash again!
Your classes going okay?
Yes. They're fine.
The other day in class,
I had a genuine illumination.
Apropos of what we already
know about Haussmann
and his rectilinear layout
of the avenues,
I'd like to touch upon gardens
and the relationship
between the city and nature.
Three students
have prepared presentations
on three spatial approaches,
reflecting three ways of thinking:
French gardens, English gardens,
and Japanese gardens.
Which garden
is your presentation on?
- French gardens.
- Go ahead.
When I saw that magnificent girl,
I thought beauty really is horrible.
Added to youth,
it's completely unfair.
Almost indecent.
I studied her face, her eyebrows,
her eyes, her mouth.
Her face was sublime.
And I thought, why?
Why her? Why is she so beautiful?
And why are all the others so...
not ugly... but, let's say,
banal, invisible?
There's something horrible...
Beauty really is disgusting!
Did you see her after class?
That's not his style.
Well, I almost did.
Really? And?
Obviously, some kid beat me to it.
The idea of waiting on line
was depressing.
Then I overheard what she told him.
What did she say?
Laetitia!
She said,
"0603
"435363."
That telephone number
was engraved in my brain.
Maybe it was its musical quality,
with its repetition of threes.
Or its progressive quality -
43, 53, 63...
Anyway, it was like a magic formula.
So it stayed with me.
Did you approach her?
Did you call her?
Worse.
I sent a text message.
A text message?
A text message.
I followed her after class.
I masked my own cell phone number.
She went for coffee
and I sent her a text.
I pretended to be a young guy.
I know. It's moronic.
- What?
- Why?
Because I'm an old fart!
Trying to see her
seemed out of place.
What did you write?
I wrote, uh...
We R in class 2 gether
U R awesome
I'm 2 hot 4 U
Oh, no. You didn't?
Yeah.
"U R awesome. I'm 2 hot 4 U."
You okay?
We just got here.
We're sleeping over.
Me and the kids.
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi!
Can you say hello?
- Hello.
- How are you?
And you?
- What?
- What did you tell them?
Not much. I'd rather you told them.
It's better if it comes from you.
What did you say?
Well, I said...
we were camping out at your place.
It's fine!
We've gotta be honest
and say I'm gonna croak.
That's not certain.
Then it'll be a nice surprise,
if it's not true.
We're not saying you're gonna croak.
We could say...
you can't work for a while
because you're weak...
because...
You can say it's better for you
to get your strength back up
to confront...
No, that's bullshit.
They're not dumb!
Let's be straight.
I think that...
your uncle
has something to tell you.
Okay.
Your uncle has...
a serious illness.
A very, very serious illness.
He may even die.
That's why we moved into his place.
Because
I'd like to take care of him.
Why are you telling us all this?
Because it's the truth, sweetie.
Are you gonna die, for sure?
Well, no. They don't know.
They may cure me.
But still... I don't know.
Even if I do... We all die!
- We all die!
- We just don't know when.
And we want it to happen
as late as possible.
But if it happens, it's no big deal.
You just have to be prepared.
They're in bed.
Think she's got a guy?
There's a good chance.
- Why?
- Because she's pretty.
And you? How come you don't?
Because I did
and now I don't anymore.
Hey, it's not easy!
At my age, it's not...
At your age!
You're 40. Not some old bag.
Things aren't the same at 40.
You don't know how men are.
They don't like women like me.
Women who talk back scare them.
They like silly young girls best.
Like her!
She's not necessarily silly.
You're saying nobody'd like you?
It's a fact.
I'm not 20 anymore. Thank God!
Your life's not over.
You just say that
'cause you got dumped.
No.
It's true,
I expected more from François.
We had a baby together.
I thought my life
would be different.
Fuck... work's a nightmare, these days.
Lay-offs, paperwork...
Your days aren't numbered.
You're alive, you've got time!
Enjoy it!
You're so fucking pessimistic.
And for no reason!
Elise, you're in great shape.
Take advantage of that!
Give chance a chance.
I believe in you!
Your life's not over!
Maybe it hasn't even started.
- Miss?
- I'm responding to your ad.
Can you come back
this afternoon instead?
Yes, if you prefer.
Stand off to the side.
Madam?
A baguette, please.
- Anything else?
- That'll be all.
Eighty cents, please.
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.
Do you have any sales experience?
- I majored in AES.
- What's that?
A retail and economics
training program.
I don't need an economist!
I also did some internships.
I worked in a bakery for a month,
as an intern.
You like that? Bakeries, all that.
That universe really attracts me.
It's a universe all right.
Hold on... Stand off to the side!
- Sir, madam...
- A baguette.
A "tradition"?
Ninety cents.
- Are you French?
- Yes, ma'am.
Really? Where were you born?
In Thiers, ma'am.
She's from the Auvergne region!
That's how it is! Like it or not!
That's Paris!
Have a nice day.
- What's your name?
- Khadija.
Of course!
Take my place and we'll see.
We'll be right with you.
- What can I get you?
- Pastries.
- How many?
- Four.
- This box?
- What do you think?
A doily!
Which ones would you like?
Elise!
Look at this.
My first sweetheart
took that picture.
Incredible!
I gotta go. Look at the time!
I'm really late. Shit!
I'm off! See you later.
Elisabeth Deleforges.
Elisabeth?
It's Pierre Bellanger.
We were in the 6th grade together.
Yeah, exactly.
I wasn't calling for any reason...
Just to say that...
Remember when we slow-danced
at Beatrice Horn's?
I don't know. In 7th or 8th grade.
I'm really glad.
It was at Viviane Chocas' house?
I just wanted to say...
That was the first time
I ever danced with a girl.
And it may've been
the happiest moment of my life.
That's it.
Sleeping outside,
it's hard to endure such temperatures,
which are...
damned cold.
Yes, of course.
Have you been here before?
I feel like...
You haven't?
Have you tried 115?
- What?
- The toll-free number.
Oh, shit.
Meaning?
Oh, fuck!
Listen, I'm on my way.
Rachel!
I have an emergency.
Can you help me?
I'm sorry, sir.
My colleague
will handle your problem.
I have a problem.
You'll be okay.
You'll be okay.
She remembered me.
I had the feeling...
she was happy to hear from me.
She was surprised but...
Rinse out your mouth.
I was so in love with Elisabeth.
I didn't dare tell her.
I think she got that.
- You think?
- Yes.
Shouldn't you see the cardiologist?
For?
You're completely nuts.
The heart problem.
Pierre's heart.
- Take a deep breath.
- Yes, yes.
It's hard to concentrate
with all this commotion. Let me relax.
It's your first shot.
We'll get there.
- Let's go.
- Everyone ready?
Roll camera. Extras action!
It was here, in the Hôtel Pimodan,
or the Hôtel Lauzun,
dating from the 17th century,
that Baudelaire
wrote his famous poem,
"Invitation to the Voyage."
It was here
that the Hashish Club met,
where Gerard de Nerval,
Theophile Gautier,
Daumier, Balzac
convened
to unite drunkenness and creation.
It's right here,
under the aegis of Baudelaire,
that we begin our portrait of Paris,
eternal city.
In his preface to Paris Spleen,
Baudelaire said that work had
"neither head nor tail."
It was a modern form of poetry,
fragmented,
"without meter or rhyme."
He justifies his desire
to compose prose poems,
by saying,
"Above all, enormous cities,
"with their incalculable
interconnections,
"beget this obsessive ideal."
Today's cities also have
"neither head nor tail."
Paris is
a fragmented wellspring of men,
stories, eras,
monuments, places...
Let us also try
to discover that universe
in a fragmented way.
To discover,
in those scattered shards,
why, "Here, all is order and beauty,
"luxury, calm and voluptuousness."
I just had one beer.
I had such a craving.
With your daily cocktail
of beta blockers,
Digoxin, Captopril and Carveditol,
one drop of alcohol and you vomit.
You have to save your strength.
You can't live the same way.
I get that but sometimes it's hard.
We're gonna have
to see each other regularly.
I have the results of your tests.
The whole team met yesterday.
All your doctors.
Endocrinologists, shrinks, everyone.
We've all studied your file
and come to the same verdict.
Our suspicions have been confirmed.
I won't lie.
This heart isn't working.
We all recommend a transplant.
Obviously, we need your consent.
It's freezing in here.
Is the air on? Or is it me?
Don't hesitate to call me.
By the way,
I'm doubling your dose of Digoxin.
That's important.
I'm looking for Orthopedics.
This is Cardiology.
Orthopedics is one floor down.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
Hello.
I go to your bakery...
where you just...
Well, uh...
Well... Have a nice day.
Come back soon.
Call me.
We used to have girls from Normandy.
I loved them.
They're workers!
Like the Alsatians.
There is a difference.
A Breton will never work
like a Norman or an Alsatian.
They're more...
They're tough as nails,
those Bretons!
Not to mention the Corsicans!
All that's to say, guess what?
I made a discovery.
- North Africans!
- Really?
Yes, North Africans.
I have one here.
Khadija. She's a gem!
It's true, they are temperamental.
But, at work, they're there.
They're upright.
Hello!
They give of themselves.
I like that.
What can I get you?
A baguette, please.
And very warm!
And a pain au chocolat.
Everything okay, Khadija?
Why?
No, I'm just asking.
That'll be 2.40.
Close the drawer. 2.40.
Punch it in. Here and here.
I was sure of it!
"Your head, your bearing,
your gestures
"A re fair as a fair countryside
"Laughter plays on your face
Like a cool wind in the sky
"The sonorous color
You scatter on your dresses
"Cast into the minds of poets
A flowery dance"
Who the fuck are you?
"Those crazy gowns are the emblem
Of your multi-colored nature
"I hate and love you equally..."
You're not some little asshole,
you're a real psycho.
"The springtime and its verdure
So mortified my heart
"That I punished a flower
For the insolence of Nature
"Some night
When the hour for pleasure sounds
"I would like to creep softly
Toward your precious body
"To punish your joyous flesh,
"Bruise your innocent breast
"To make in your surprised flank
A wide and deep wound
"A nd, dizzying sweetness!
"Through those new lips,
Brighter and lovelier,
"To infuse my venom,
"My sister!"
Bones from the Carmes Convent
January 25, 1814
Construction of the catacombs
began in 1780,
just a few years
before the French Revolution.
The numerous mass graves
at that time
made certain neighborhoods
uninhabitable.
Like the current
Place des Innocents.
They were...
The bodies... the bones
were moved, one by one...
and stacked...
stacked...
I can't. I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm sorry.
No offense,
but I don't believe in this.
I've always found
all this stuff ridiculous.
All what stuff?
Well, you, this...
The couch, psychoanalysis.
I find it completely stupid.
I find it moronic.
Really?
Then why did you come?
I don't really know why I came.
But the problem is
I don't believe in it.
You have to be completely naïve
to do this.
To do what?
Well, to go there.
To tell your life story,
your childhood,
that whole Oedipus complex thing.
"I'm so attached to my mommy.
How much do I owe you, Doctor?"
Isn't that kind of pathetic?
No.
I can't imagine that
lying on that couch
and blathering on for hours
about your past can,
I don't know,
heal wounds.
I'm pragmatic. You understand?
I'm concrete.
All that guru stuff's not my thing.
I'm the opposite of naïve.
I only believe in what I see.
And what do you see?
Well...
I'm an historian.
In my field,
we follow tangible leads.
You're thinking,
"This guy's really sick."
"He's really sick.
"He came
but he won't admit he's really sick.
"He acts like he's in great shape.
"He's acting out
his defense mechanisms," as you say.
Isn't that what you're thinking?
I'm listening.
If you came here,
you must feel that something's wrong.
You talk about tangible leads.
What tangible things led you here?
Well, I...
I started a new job a few weeks ago.
I'm doing a sort of
popularization thing for TV.
The other day, I completely snapped.
That's never happened to me before.
I'm afraid now. I'm afraid.
It's an anxiety
I can't wrap my mind around.
It's weird. I don't understand it.
I've always been pretty good
at analyzing things.
Digging up what's not working,
solving problems.
That's my basic activity,
solving problems.
I spent my...
I'm sorry...
I just can't...
It's completely stupid.
Crying like an idiot.
You're good! You won!
I haven't won a thing.
You know, I don't take pleasure
in seeing you cry.
It's no big deal.
Yes, some things are a big deal.
You've admitted
that you're suffering.
You've just realized
something important.
I just realized something?
Yes. You've just realized
the unconscious exists.
It's just given you
"tangible" proof, as you say.
They say that deciding to see a shrink
is already half the battle.
Has anything
happened to you recently?
No. Aside from that new job...
Yes. Oh, yeah...
Now you'll laugh in my face.
I'm not here to laugh in your face.
Go on, tell me.
It may have no relation at all.
Go ahead.
My father died a month ago.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Come and see.
Hold on, that's not it.
That's the entrance. I'll show you
the lobby to give you an idea.
People look happy here.
Oh, that's just an animation thing.
3D stuff.
I went to see a psychoanalyst.
A shrink? Why?
I'm sorry, I'm stunned.
Why a shrink?
I'm obviously not well.
Nervous depression, I think.
You're just fine. You're like me.
You're not depressed.
I'm not like you, please.
And I'm not "just fine."
I know that's not a Verneuil thing.
I'm different.
You've always done what you should.
Never a problem. I'm not like that.
I've always done what I should?
It's always been that way.
Even Mom and Dad were like that.
You did everything well.
I was the pain in the ass,
the weirdo,
the problem child.
If that's how you see me...
That's how you are.
That's why we'll never get along.
We've just spent an hour here
and you can't see I'm not well.
You can't even see I'm not well.
You're blinded by wedded bliss,
by your plans to have a baby.
Can't you see I'll never make it?
I could never be like you.
A normal guy.
Completely normal.
Want some herbal tea?
What does "being normal" mean?
I don't know... Nothing.
Roland said I was normal.
He's gotta heal himself.
He's not normal!
Exactly. He said that, too.
He is healing himself.
He's seeing a shrink.
Really?
Why?
I don't know.
He says he's not well,
he's depressed.
He said
I always did everything well.
Do I do everything well?
Well, no...
That's what I said.
Not really.
Not especially.
You haven't got a clue
about lots of stuff.
Lots of your projects aren't...
Some things you blow completely.
Frankly, I think that's unfair.
Anybody here?
Are you my kids?
I have three kids?
That's not what I planned.
I made a mistake in the blueprints.
We'll be Mickael, Marie and Rose.
No, I had something else in mind.
- Look, it's fabulous.
- Yes, it's beautiful.
That's not what I designed.
I imagined
a completely different façade.
- Great to see you.
- How about a movie?
Mommy, look!
I love this neighborhood.
I love this city.
I love this building!
It's impressive. So many floors!
Think you'll finish on schedule?
Great work, guys!
So close to the mall.
- It's so airy!
- What a great vibe!
Do you think you're all normal?
Do you think you're all normal?
Everything's perfect, dear.
I'm normal.
So are you. Very normal!
- Are you okay?
- No!
That's enough, now!
Are you okay, dear?
I'm sorry.
Yes, I'll be fine.
It's you?
It's me.
Obviously,
this is very embarrassing.
I don't feel well.
I don't feel well at all.
That's all you can say?
I'm truly sorry. Really sorry.
You should be.
You're completely nuts!
Do you realize what you did?
How humiliating this is?
It's horrible!
What's your trip?
You think people are puppets?
You smile, on top of it!
I'm not smiling.
I'm embarrassed. You can see that.
Sit down.
Please, sit down.
I'm really not
some Machiavellian pervert.
It was just awkwardness.
I was just trying to...
Sit down.
You didn't answer me.
What's your fantasy?
Manipulating students?
Not at all.
They've got video games for that.
If you're into virtual manipulation.
You pick a character
and go beep-beep,
like some asshole!
All done?
All done what?
Have you gotten it out of your system?
Not enough.
I forgot it could be so good!
Has it been that long?
Ancient times!
See that old tome on that table?
I think the date is marked in there.
High Middle Ages!
I'd have to give my cock
a carbon-14 test.
You're funny!
No, I'm not funny.
I'm incredibly anxious.
Like all people who make jokes,
I'm filling the void, fear of death.
You can be pretty unfunny, too.
Are you okay with the student-
screwing-her-professor cliché?
I even like it.
And are you okay with it, sir?
Please, make an effort.
Stop calling me sir.
Watch out for cars!
Wait, Jules.
Simone,
I hear you're in love with Nicolas!
