Mademoiselle...
- Are you Sophie Bonhomme?
- Yes, madame.
I'm Catherine Lelièvre.
Please, sit down.
Thank you, madame.
Would you like something...
a cup of tea?
Don't bother.
I insist!
Another tea, please.
Let me explain the situation.
We live in an isolated house,
near a large village
about ten kilometres from here.
It's quite large
but there are only three of us.
My stepdaughter only stays with us
some weekends.
We entertain now and again,
it's a little more work.
The house is well equipped.
I'm not afraid of work, madame.
I usually do the cooking,
my husband shops once a week
or else we call in the order.
Your working day won't be too long.
I know how to cook.
The house is isolated. Is that OK?
I don't know.
I can take you to town
once in a while, if you like.
I manage an art gallery.
Would you like to see my references?
Of course.
Mrs Dutoit can't keep me,
her husband died.
She's joining her son in Australia.
My goodness.
So you're available straight away?
I was with her a long time.
There were never any problems.
She'll tell you.
Here's her number and address.
I'll call her tonight.
I don't foresee any problems.
The house is quite hard to find.
I'll pick you up at the station.
Do you know what train
you arrive on?
9 a.m.
When shall we say...
Tuesday?
What day is this?
Saturday.
That leaves you Sunday and Monday.
That OK?
Tuesday is fine. Thank you, madame.
It's a deal. See you on Tuesday.
Mrs Dutoit paid me 5,500 francs.
Oh, sorry...
6,000 francs?
That's fine.
Well?
I'll tell you all about it.
We expected you last night!
I was busy.
You could have called.
Your dad was concerned about you.
You need a hand?
That's kind but I've almost finished.
Where are the men?
They installed the satellite dish.
They're glued to the screen.
Look at this Gorgo,
it's fantastic!
It's fantastic.
Just pick something!
What do you want to watch?
A sunset.
Well?
Touch wood...
This girl might work.
Naturally.
Not the TV, you idiot!
I meant the maid, dear.
How degrading - the maid!
What should we call her.
What's her name?
Why not housekeeper or domestic.
Imagine saying "my domestic"?
Honestly darling,
calling her "maid" is just fine!
Maid...
"Made-to-do-everything!"
Who could complain?
You're an idiot.
These are good!
Can the maid cook?
Fool! You ask stupid questions!
Her former employer said she's good.
She's got a trial period?!
I stupidly forgot to mention it.
I'm sure she'll be fine.
We need someone.
That's for sure.
I hope she's not ugly.
You want to have a go with her?
He likes pretty things.
Thanks, Gorgo!
Don't mention it.
Every valid question
deserves an answer.
Let me think...
I don't know.
I would've noticed
if she was hideous.
I hope she's not as bad
as the last one.
No comparison.
Finished?
Unless you want to eat the shells...
You can judge for yourselves
on Tuesday.
She arrives at 9 a.m.
I thought I'd missed you!
No, I took an earlier train.
I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long.
Let's go...
My car's out the front.
I was lucky to find that spot.
Madame Lelièvre!
Sorry to bother you,
I'm the postal clerk from St Coulomb.
Yes, of course.
Would you drop me at the post office?
Sure.
My bus won't be here
for another hour.
I can't leave Annie alone.
Sit in the front with me, Sophie.
After you.
I like to take three days a month
to see my family.
We can take our holidays
when we want.
You could take a month
with your family?
I wouldn't like that at all!
Sophie, would you be kind enough
to check the glove compartment?
There should be some cigarettes.
Sorry.
- Thanks.
- Not at all.
She must be wondering who you are.
My husband can't stand her.
This weighs a ton.
Don't worry,
the house is easy to handle.
I'll take it!
Follow me.
You're strong.
Here we are.
The shower's next door.
Unpack your things.
Take your time...
I'll show you around later.
I can come now.
I'll unpack later.
I'll have some coffee.
Do you like the room?
I don't know, madame.
I mean yes. It's fine.
Thank you.
"JUSTICE IS BORN
OUT OF HUMANITY"
This way.
This is your domain.
We'll look at it later.
Come on.
The cleaning things
are under the stairs.
The dining room.
Careful with the rug, it's fragile.
The floor is easy,
soap and water will do the trick.
My room.
Could you change the sheets?
It's up to you to keep it tidy.
The library.
I'm late!
Is everything clear?
I don't know.
I think so.
I've got to dash.
I'll be home at around 6 p.m.
If you need anything,
call me at the gallery.
The number's by the phone.
Gilles comes home at 5 p.m. See you!
Have you prepared the vegetables?
Yes. I'll bring them right away.
Is she good?
Until now, she's been wonderful.
Let's cross our fingers.
Anyway the place is tidy
and her cooking's simple and good.
Does the gourmet approve?
It's OK!
Put it here please.
We'll serve ourselves.
We should teach her to serve properly.
She must know how.
We can't ask her to take a test.
When are we leaving, Daddy?
The boat's ready on the 20th.
I'm handling the plane tickets.
I hope we won't be fighting again like last year.
We can stay longer if you like.
No. I'm going to my dad's.
My friend's having a great party.
Is Sophie going away?
She's just got here.
Where would she go?
At least we're not invaded by her friends.
Not one call or letter.
Thank heavens she's got the TV.
This chicken looks succulent!
You want to pacify her with that TV.
Honestly!
My life's easier.
I don't even have to talk to her.
She's like a slave.
She's not a robot.
Don't you think you're exaggerating a touch?
You can clear the table!
Impeccable,
except she avoids the books!
That suits me,
as long as she tidies my papers.
Don't you see
you're making her stupid?
- Why don't you let her use your car?
- What about yours?!
I don't think
she knows how to drive.
I'll see about that tomorrow.
If she doesn't know how,
we can pay for lessons.
Well, Melinda?
Not too paternalistic?
Paternalistic, no. Patronising, yes.
I said no smoking.
It's easier not to start
than to give up.
I'm curious about something.
Why don't you use the dishwasher?
I don't like machines.
This is faster.
If you want to go into town,
my wife can lend you her car.
I don't know how to drive.
We'll pay for lessons.
No, I can't. My eyes are bad.
Don't you have glasses?
I don't know.
They're old.
We'll take care of that straight away.
I'll make an appointment for you on Friday.
I'll drop you off.
Melinda can pick you up.
Fine.
Melinda will be here at 11 a.m.
Have a walk around.
Have the bill sent to me.
Fine.
Have a good day.
Don't you have any change?
Yes you do!
You've got the exact change.
Can I help you?
Any lighter lenses?
Certainly, follow me.
Not too expensive?
Not at all. Look!
I've only got 100 francs.
Then you're fine.
I'll take them.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It's all right, mademoiselle.
- When will they be ready?
- What?
Your glasses.
Wednesday.
That'll give you the chance
to come back to town.
Are you settling in OK?
Not too much at the house?
They're demanding.
Don't let them get the better of you.
They're happy with you,
take advantage of it.
I understand.
Could you iron my white suit?
Thanks in advance
Don't get up,
I just want a glass of milk.
"Please iron my white suit?"
That's for you.
I'll iron my things later.
If you have time...
I'll do it. I like ironing.
Got the tickets?
Are you kidding?
Philippe, this is for Fournier.
Yes, sir.
I'll send a postcard.
I hope you won't need anything.
There'll be a delivery of groceries.
If you need anything, just call.
We'll be back on the 2nd.
That's it. Have a good week.
Don't forget to pick up your glasses.
I'm delivering Mrs Lelièvre's order.
There's one more.
This work makes you thirsty.
Do you have a beer?
Don't bother.
See the telethon last night?
We really came through.
500,000 francs just from Brittany.
- I don't know.
- It's true.
You have to sign...
for the... delivery.
I don't know how to do my boss's signature.
Sign your name, then.
Just sign it.
Come on.
There you go.
It's official.
Got to go.
If you need anything...
just call and I'll be right over.
No! Not those.
These are better and cheaper!
- Is it milk chocolate?
- See?
Extra fine milk chocolate.
- Thanks.
- No problem!
How's your new job?
Fine.
Especially when they're gone.
Have they written to you yet?
They're lucky to have you.
They've been looking for a while.
Thanks.
I'm going home.
Can't you stay a while?
There might be calls.
I'd drive you
but I have to get back to work.
I work all day.
If you're in town, stop by!
It's so quiet,
I have time to read.
Am I disturbing you?
You got a card.
I was in the area.
I'll let you in.
Don't bother!
You have a car?
It's old, but it's hanging in there.
Here!
I don't have my glasses.
I'll read it, if you don't mind.
"Having a great time.
The water's nice.
"Thinking of you, Melinda."
I don't take holidays.
I don't like them.
They say Corsica's dangerous.
They've got pirates!
Pirates?
Yeah, guys who blow up boats.
It's really big here.
You must have lots of work!
What a job!
You could eat off the floor!
You could come to my place, too!
What class!
What a TV!
Must've cost a bundle!
- How does it work?
- I don't know.
You never tried?
So many channels!
All these books! I love reading!
I took a book. Do you mind?
Journey To The End Of The Night.
Is it good?
I don't know.
Céline, that's my mother's name.
They've got some library!
Do you think I could go upstairs?
How do you turn it off?
Let's be friends.
If you want...
I like the way it's decorated.
They sleep in the same room?
All these clothes!
You can see she was a model.
Some doubt it, but...
models change their names
like actresses.
Are there any photos around?
I modelled as a kid...
They didn't pick me.
They chose a skinny blonde.
I'm sure it was her... as a blonde.
I'd really like to be an actress.
Wouldn't you?
I don't know.
I saw her photos.
One day she was in the post office.
We recognised each other.
She was watching me.
Maybe she wasn't sure
and wondered where she'd seen me.
I wonder why she's living in the country.
Maybe she wants to hide,
after the way she lived in Paris.
Odd things must go on here.
This house has
a strange reputation in town.
And he's a shady character.
Is it true he always listens to music?
Sometimes.
Someone in his factory told me
he listens to music in his office.
He's the girl's father.
Is she nice?
She's not too bad.
This is it?
It's not the biggest,
but it's not bad
They gave you their old TV.
I don't even have one.
I can come and keep you company.
If you wish.
Relax, we're friends!
I'd better get going.
- Can I wash my hands?
- Yes. I've got some soap.
Don't bother!
Maybe we can go out one day.
I volunteer at the church.
It's good to help others.
They need a hand sorting clothes
and other things.
Interested?
Maybe.
- Are you free on Sundays?
- Maybe.
They don't even respect the Lord's day!
Stand up to them!
See you soon.
And thanks for the tour.
Drop in for a visit
whenever you want.
You have a problem?
It's the battery again.
I just got it fixed.
Want me to look?
Could you?
I'm hopeless with cars.
Don't expect much,
but I'm good with cars.
Not me.
- Poetry's my thing.
- Really?
Trying to get published?
Not yet.
I'm waiting a while.
Try starting the engine.
It works.
The battery must have a short circuit.
Thanks a lot.
Have you got a rag?
I have a hankie.
Thanks.
Thanks again!
No problem.
If I were you I'd see a mechanic.
What a nice surprise!
Haven't seen you lately.
Got a boyfriend?
No. I have exams.
Already?
I've got to study.
That's true.
You still like hunting?
Maybe.
Where are Catherine and Gilles?
They're taking a walk.
They're mushroom hunting.
Why didn't you go?
You know how it is.
Shall I clean the guns?
Sure. It won't do them any harm.
Is our precious Sophie
taking driving lessons?
She never brought it up again.
Gilles says he often sees her in town.
Maybe she prefers walking.
So, do I clean the guns?
I'll try to make it one Sunday.
No promises.
Then I'll clean the guns.
Sophie! You never stop!
Even on Sundays!
I like ironing.
Go ahead. Pretend I'm not here.
Do you mind giving me a lift?
My scooter's on the blink.
Of course I mind. Come on.
See you tonight!
Come here, you.
I'm running late!
I have a meeting this morning.
I'm afraid I won't be back.
I left a shopping list
next to the phone.
Call them around 2:30.
They'll deliver it later in the day.
Don't forget, because there's
nothing left to eat.
Thanks. I'll see you later.
What brings you here now?
Can you help me?
Our phone's down.
I have to order groceries.
Can you do it for me?
Give me that.
First I'll call the repair service.
Don't bother.
Mr Lelièvre is going to call.
He should've taken the list.
He didn't know about the list.
I forgot to tell him.
It's beneath him anyway!
I want to place an order.
For the Lelièvre family.
Two packets of spaghetti,
two heads of lettuce,
four veal cutlets,
eight lamb chops,
four rump steaks,
four cans of sardines in oil,
three cans of sardines with pimento...
Why sardines?
They make their own.
Must be better than theirs.
Got that? Sardines?
Six bottles of Vichy Célestins water.
Four packs of coffee.
Yes, Carte Noire.
Two packs of blue napkins.
Five kilos of OMO washing powder.
OK, I'll tell them.
Thanks a lot.
They didn't have...
the bottles of Vichy, the coffee...
the washing powder
and the napkins... out of stock.
Big stores run out of things, too.
Try next door.
Thanks. It was nice of you.
Wait a minute!
Look!
Do you want to see this?
Sure. Why not?
I love Paul Newman.
Can I come over?
Yes. When's it on?
Look... On Sunday!
I'll take you to the church first.
They're collecting for winter.
I'll pick you up at noon.
I need Carte Noire coffee,
six bottles of Vichy Célestins...
OMO washing powder,
and blue paper napkins.
You have that?
You're really loaded down!
Poor Sophie. Get in.
Some things were out of stock.
I got them somewhere else.
That's nice of you.
Anyway, I like walking.
It's Melinda's birthday on Sunday.
Can you help out with the guests?
Well... Sunday...
I volunteer at the church.
Really?
Well, it's good to help others.
The postal clerk and I
are going to sort clothes.
I understand.
Do what you can.
I'll try to manage myself.
Quick, it's really windy!
Did you see this?
Wait, I'm helping Sophie.
No blue napkins.
I'll manage.
- Why are you home?
- I'm working.
Just look at this package.
It was opened and badly resealed.
You think so? What's in it?
Looks like a gift for Melinda.
She'll think I opened it.
Don't be foolish!
It's obvious
the letters are resealed, too.
I've had it. If they hire misfits,
they should at least do their job!
Misfits!
Exactly! Her daughter
ended up in the hospital...
then she died!
- I didn't hear about it.
- It's true!
They couldn't prove child abuse,
but she was arrested and charged.
How do you know?
It was in the papers.
Don't you remember?
You know I don't read the papers.
Maybe it wasn't her.
It was.
I recognised her photo right away.
She'll be hearing from me!
That's no proof.
It is, or I would've complained.
How's it going, Sophie?
Can I help?
No thank you, mademoiselle.
You did all this?
No. Just the quiches
and cheese tarts.
How nice of you.
It was nothing.
Is it noon yet?
No, it's 11:30.
Don't worry, you're not late.
It's Jérémie!
At least he's not late.
- You want this?
- Yes.
- Happy birthday!
- What is it?
Why don't you open it?
Is it party time?
My brother Gilles... Jérémie.
Great!
You like it?
It's the best one, for the price!
Can I borrow it?
- I'll steal it.
- Just you try!
Come and meet my parents.
Concerto for flute and harp, K 299.
You did your homework.
Here's Jérémie.
Meet my parents.
Look what I got.
How wonderful!
Dad, he listens to Mozart.
- You like Mozart?
- Very much.
Melinda says you're a music buff.
Put it on the table.
Have a seat, Jérémie.
Welcome.
You're our first guest.
We're waiting for
some friends and cousins.
Darling, can you ask Sophie
for some ice?
Really, Catherine,
these quiches are divine.
Our Sophie made them.
She's a bit odd, but a real pearl.
You're so lucky!
How does it feel being 20?
No big deal.
I love the gifts.
A philosopher once said...
"Let no one say 20
is the best age in life."
It could be worse...
Speaking of quotes,
I have one that's less well known
but also rather troubling.
"There are aspects of good people
I find loathsome,
"least of all the evil within."
My God. Who said that?
Nietzsche.
I didn't prepare a huge feast.
It's more a light buffet.
What a good idea!
Thanks. Where's Sophie?
She's not there!
What do you mean?
It's all ready, but she's gone.
What's going on here?
Excuse me.
I can't believe it!
She's taken off.
- You took your time!
- I couldn't come sooner.
It's OK. Look what I found!
Mushrooms! You like them?
We'll cook them at my place,
then sort clothes at the church.
The bastards wouldn't let you go?
They have guests,
it's Melinda's birthday.
But I sneaked out.
Good for you.
I'd like to see their faces.
It's not just her birthday,
it's mine too.
Really?
We'll celebrate with the mushrooms!
That's great!
Get the wine from the fridge.
I hope there's not too much garlic.
It can't hurt.
The bread's fresh, I got it this morning.
A little wine.
Is it nice?
Is it really your birthday?
I know something about you.
Something good, I hope.
You killed your daughter.
- Who told you that?
- I just know.
- How do you know?
- I just do.
It's not true.
It was her own fault.
Anyway, they couldn't prove it.
- Want to see photos?
- It wasn't you?
I said no!
The judge said there wasn't proof.
How could a mother kill her child?
It's not possible.
Even if it wasn't normal.
I know something about you.
Do you like chocolate ice cream?
It's in the freezer.
Take it out, let it soften.
It's cold, but good!
Isn't that you in the photo?
Read it!
OK, then, I will.
"The fire was criminal,
but the criminal runs free.
"The fire that ravaged
15 rue de la Providence
"was proved criminal in nature.
"Mr Jacques Bonhomme
died in the fire.
"The arsonist remains at large.
"The victim was cared for
"by his daughter,
who had just left to go shopping.
"She was quickly proved innocent.
"Can the same be said
for the property developers
"who put up a luxury building
on the site of the modest home?"
Isn't that you?
You are Sophie Bonhomme?
Leave that, we'll do it later.
Did you kill your father?
They couldn't prove it!
Enough of that.
Let's go and do some good now.
We need a change.
Wait!
Hello, Mrs Lantier.
Thanks for coming.
We need you.
I've brought a friend with me.
- Sophie, Mrs Lantier.
- Nice to have your help.
We get a lot of donations,
mostly unusable.
Come this way, here we are.
- To work!
- What do we do?
Do what I do!
Keep the good stuff, get rid of the rest.
I can sew the missing buttons on this.
Forget it! It's falling apart...
Chuck it!
Hurry up!
You're late! The priest's waiting!
You're 15 minutes late, children.
Hurry up!
This thing is full of holes.
What charity!
What's that?
It's the choir rehearsing.
How generous!
Arithmetic, levels one and two...
What nerve, they really use us
as a rubbish bin. Don't you think?
I don't know.
Mrs Lantier reeks of old tobacco
and the priest smells like pee.
My father stank of pee, too!
I hope there isn't too much mess
after the party.
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.
- Sophie told me.
- Have a good evening.
Come on, this way.
Quick, turn it on!
Is that channel two?
No, that's channel one.
Damned ads!
All this way to buy stamps!
It's not my fault.
These have been systematically
opened and resealed!
It's not the first time!
My packages, too.
I'm going to complain!
I don't know. They arrive like that.
It's not my fault.
An investigation will clarify things.
I had no such problems
with your predecessor!
Anyway, you can't prove it!
You look at me!
I can see you just fine.
Lack of proof got you off once,
but not a second time.
Who do you think you are,
accusing me of opening your mail?
I know all about you.
You read newspaper gossip,
but I know who you are!
Your wife's a whore
and your first wife was no better!
I'd kill myself, too!
Excuse me.
Did you see that guy?!
Did you let her have it?
The woman's crazy!
- Where are you going?
- Football.
Sorry to bother you.
I left an important file at home.
I'm sending my driver to pick it up.
It's on my desk.
The file says...
- What happened with the file, Sophie?
- I didn't find it.
It was under your nose.
No one was here when he came!
The line went dead.
I called right back.
It didn't ring.
- I have to go to the kitchen.
- Wait.
My driver said no one was in.
I went shopping.
Is my husband home?
Here you are!
Your hired help
is getting on my nerves!
She's not a secretary, Georges.
She's simply a maid.
It doesn't take Einstein to find a file.
She hangs up and takes off!
Unbelievable!
You can't expect her
to do certain things.
Doing orders, phoning
and tidying books are beyond her.
Excuse me, but the house is perfect.
I excuse you,
but I'm getting fed up.
Don't you see she's changed?
Sometimes she's really insolent.
And she's here less and less.
Listen, darling.
I don't want to start this all over again.
No question of that.
But no one's irreplaceable.
That's true...
but finding her was hard.
I've got to get back to my meeting!
Poor darling.
I hope it won't be long.
Eat without me.
- We're watching a film tonight.
- TV dinners?
- Without me?
- Without you!
A good film, too!
Her omelette was good!
Yeah, great.
Why?
I mean Sophie's a good cook.
Yeah, she is.
That's nothing new.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Be nice. Get my cigarettes
from the bedroom.
Right now?
Do you mind?
Not at all.
He's odd, isn't he?
He won't talk.
Thanks, darling.
Want one?
Am I allowed?
You can smoke, but only in my presence.
Anything to keep you happy.
Something's bothering me.
I don't think Georges
and Sophie are getting along.
Why do you say that?
He says she's getting complacent.
I didn't notice.
She's here with her friend.
Her friend?
You know, the postal clerk.
What?
She's here?
Georges will be furious!
Don't tell him.
You think so?
What choice have you got?
I can't.
I can't start hiding things from him.
Why can't things ever be easy?
Can I come
and watch a film tomorrow?
Just stay out of sight.
I'm afraid I've got something
unpleasant to tell you.
My wife and I don't wish
to interfere with your private life.
You can see who you want.
But we don't want...
your friend in our house.
- She didn't do anything.
- No discussion.
I'll have no one in my house who...
tells lies about us...
and who opens my mail.
I can't stop you from seeing her.
That's your business.
Look what you made me do.
You look upset!
It's the maid!
I don't know about you,
but I find her...
Revolting?
Exactly.
If your mother wasn't so anxious...
I'd throw her out now.
When are you getting
your scooter back? I'm not a taxi!
- Missed me?
- It's not that.
- Is he on your back again?
- You can't come over any more.
I knew it.
See how they're using you
and you keep kissing their feet!
You sucker!
Even his daughter calls him a fascist.
His wife picks up men all day long
in her so-called "gallery".
You call that a gallery!
And the son's out of his mind.
He's the one who said I was there.
You can't see whoever you want?!
What bullshit!
I won't listen.
They're pathetic!
What do they know,
they've got it all!
All they have to worry about
is what car to buy
or what cousin
stole half the inheritance.
I'd be happy with a tenth
of what they have.
I'd have the life I wanted.
Not what I have now.
They won't get away with it!
Drop me here.
I'll drop you at the door.
No one's here at this time!
Why's the girl's car here?
Can't hang on to a boyfriend
so she runs home to Daddy.
She's so spoilt!
Do you know anything?
You should. You never say a word.
I'll drop you here to avoid trouble.
Find out what you can.
Then tell me... for once.
See you later.
I'm home to make a few calls.
Jérémie's in England.
They're not expecting you.
I'll call now.
How are you?
Hanging in there?
I'm fine, but I'd rather be with you.
How are you?
I've got a problem...
Is it serious?
Kind of...
I'm ten days late...
Is that usual?
No! I'm sure I'm pregnant.
I feel nauseous.
Don't panic.
First buy a pregnancy test.
If it's positive,
we'll have a few weeks to think.
If you want an abortion...
or if you want to keep it,
I'm with you.
How do you feel?
I don't know.
I need to think.
I'm not jumping for joy.
It's too early.
But I swear I'll stand by you.
Dad'll be livid.
You're over-reacting.
You don't understand.
He's obsessed with sex education.
He's talked about birth control
since I was 12.
He thinks it could happen
to anyone but me.
And I'm on his health plan.
He'll know if I have an abortion
and he'll disown me.
That's not true.
What matters is us, not your dad.
We'll talk and decide what to do.
Then I'll talk to him. OK?
Call me tomorrow?
OK, I will.
I love you, Melinda.
We'll have kids.
If not this time, we'll try again,
don't worry.
I love you. I'll call you.
You'll strain your eyes.
How about some tea?
Why not?
So your friend's not allowed over.
That's right.
You should see who you want!
Dad always thinks he knows
what's best. It's so fascist!
Jeanne and I help out at the church.
I know. You told me.
Where are the cups?
In the draining rack.
What would you call your baby?
I don't know.
I don't like my name.
Sophie's pretty.
You know it means "wisdom" in Greek?
Is there any sugar?
Let's have some fun.
I saw a good quiz.
"Are You A Bitch?"
They don't mince words.
"1. He says he's in love
with a man.
"A) You laugh...
"B) You make him take
an AIDS test...
"C) You ask for a divorce...
"D) You ask to meet his lover...
"E) You all shack up...
"F) You want it kept secret."
I know, you ask the questions
to see if I'm a bitch.
I've got work to do.
It's not long!
I don't have my glasses.
There they are!
Did I upset you?
I'm sorry.
Let's look at the clothes.
I like that better.
Are you dyslexic?
I'm sorry...
I mean...
I didn't realise.
You can't read. I didn't realise.
You should have told us.
There are plenty like you.
I can teach you if you want.
The other day, I saw a TV programme...
about illiteracy.
A doctor was talking about
her method of helping
people like you,
and others even older.
Dad could send you to see her in Paris.
If you say a word to anybody,
I'll say you're pregnant.
What?
If you talk, I'll tell.
I'm not the bitch - you are!
Mind your own business.
We're home!
Where's Melinda?
My little girl.
What a nice surprise!
What's wrong?
I'll leave you.
No, please stay.
I've something to tell you.
What's so terrible?
She's illiterate.
What?
It can't be true!
Of course...
We should've known!
I'll admit I never thought of it.
Does it still exist?!
Imagine being so ashamed.
It's still no excuse for blackmail.
I'm sorry, but she's fired!
Yes. We can't ignore this!
What a pair! One can't read,
and the other reads our mail.
Well, children...
You know why I'm here.
Melinda told me everything.
I'm sorry,
but I won't tolerate blackmail.
I know life is hard...
and if you're illiterate,
it's probably not your fault.
I feel sorry for you.
But blackmail... no.
I won't tolerate it.
I'm turning this off.
Are you even interested?
I could throw you out tonight!
We have no contract.
I don't want to be too hard.
You can keep your room for a week.
Let's see,
today's Thursday...
I want you out in a week.
Understood?
You'll get all your work records.
But I don't want any calls
asking for references.
It's in your interest.
If you find something sooner,
don't hesitate to go.
The sooner you're out, the better.
Naturally you're relieved
of your duties.
They're so slow!
What is it?
It's the church collection.
We're here to collect,
I don't know... old clothes...
or cans of food.
Usually, the priest comes.
This time it's us!
The priest's busy.
Come in.
Who is it?
The girls from the church.
- We put some things aside.
- Should I get them?
No, I'll handle it.
I put this aside.
You always come around now.
Looks like a pile of rubbish!
What?!
We're not the municipal dump, you know.
- What are you doing?
- Sorting!
Come and help.
This... out it goes!
Just look at this!
This stinks.
You can keep this.
Honestly!
It's expired!
Are you trying to poison the poor?
- What is it?
- Come and see!
The rest is rubbish.
Thanks. See you next year!
I'll call the church!
Next time, keep your junk!
Heathens!
Once we deliver this stuff we're done.
We had a laugh, eh?
Did you finally get Sundays off?
They fired me.
The bastards!
I knew it.
Was it Melinda?
Damn car!
The battery short-circuits.
Tell me everything.
First we'll drop this off.
This stinks!
Here you are!
We collected this.
It's all good, we made sure.
Put it in the corner.
Father wants to see you.
Father, it's Jeanne and Sophie.
Coming.
Here you are!
I have something
very serious to say.
I suppose you do the best you can,
but we can't accept the way
you conduct yourselves.
We're very tolerant.
We can't expect too much
from volunteers.
But our reputation is at risk,
and your behaviour is unacceptable.
We've had complaints,
and I must say I have trouble
believing what I've heard.
I don't know what got into you,
but you've gone too far.
In a word...
we no longer want you
working with us.
You don't want our help?
Maybe you should see a doctor.
What a very good idea!
He scurries and scurries,
the ferret in the woods...
He screws, he screws,
our Father, the priest...
With Mrs Lantier.
Think so?
Well, well!
Tell me how they fired you.
There's nothing to say.
You never spill the beans, do you?
Come on, let's eat at my place.
Yes. I'm hungry.
I'm not sure I've got any food.
I love your coffee maker.
Why stay with those bastards?
You'll have no trouble finding work.
In the meantime, stay here.
Think so?
It'll be a laugh.
We'll get your stuff later.
Melinda's pregnant.
Were they upset?
I don't know.
How did you find out?
It's no problem for them.
Keep it or get rid of it...
no problem.
Too bad there's no food!
Great meal!
Please, darling,
it's just ham and salad.
Wasn't the salad perfect?
Don't push it.
Melinda made it!
I'm not pushing it.
It was perfect.
The concert starts in ten minutes.
Hurry up!
Come on, move it!
Let's move the TV into the library
for the stereo.
How do we move this thing?
It rolls and there's an extension.
You decided to join us after all?
I like opera.
Can I tape this?
Sure. I'll set it up.
What impressive handiwork!
Bully!
It's connected.
I hope Jérémie doesn't call
during the second act.
He called twice.
The happy event isn't for tomorrow.
I found the Italian-French
bilingual score for the opera.
It's in the CD.
It's not the same.
Mozart, here we are.
- Is it recording?
- Yes.
When I was pregnant and all alone,
nobody was there to dry my tears
or to tell me what to do,
where to go for an abortion.
But I wanted it, I wasn't afraid
to bring it up alone.
The cops who accused me
of killing her
should've known I could've
dumped her from the start.
She never cried or bothered me.
She stayed in her corner,
never complaining.
She was twelve days short
of her fourth birthday.
I came in with my groceries.
Something brushed my leg.
I didn't know it was her...
It scared me.
My reflex was to kick it off.
It was winter, the stove heater was on.
I took the groceries
in the kitchen...
I was putting things away,
I can't remember too well...
When I came into the room,
she was against the stove.
Her cheek was all blistered...
I panicked,
I don't know what I did...
I went next door for help.
All the bitch said was,
"What have you done?!"
She's the one
who called the police.
I wasn't capable of doing a thing.
The police wouldn't believe me
and took me to prison.
I could never figure out
what the judge was thinking.
Maybe nothing at all.
Next came the verdict.
The judge wasn't hard on me.
He said there was no proof against me.
He said it was a terrible accident.
So they let me go.
The post office
gave me my job back.
They transferred me
here from Rennes.
To avoid gossip
or things like that.
What about your old man?
Stop here.
Why? We're getting your stuff.
I'm asking you.
You're still afraid of them?
Come on, hurry up!
Want some hot chocolate?
Hands up!
They must like hunting!
They do.
Let's go upstairs.
No, let me.
They've been screwing!
Take that, bitch!
They'll know it's us!
So she won't be jealous!
How about some cocoa?
Hang on, we have to pour it!
Anyone for coffee?
I'm taping!
No. Between acts.
Come on, clothes!
Come on, beauty!
Come on, dress!
Phone's dead!
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.
Let's scare them.
How does this work?
No, not like that.
I saw him do it.
- What hidden talent!
- I even know where the bullets are.
- You'll break it!
- You're supposed to.
You stick those inside?
How do you like it?
It's very homogenous.
No one's stealing the limelight.
Did you hear that noise earlier?
It's Sophie sneaking back.
She's creeping in.
Wasn't it glass breaking?
No. It was the opera...
the stereo.
Are you dozing?
No, thinking.
Digesting what I heard!
What was that?
I think the postal clerk is here.
Think so? I'll go and see.
Let them say their adieux!
I'll be a minute.
You'll miss the start of the second act!
What's going on here?
Put that down
or I'll call the police!
I told you to keep out!
His goose is cooked!
What was that?
A gunshot?
It's the postal clerk's old wreck.
Here's my favourite part.
What's Georges up to?
He just shot those two loonies.
Go and see, Gilles.
I'm worried.
Quiet! He's just throwing them out.
Come on, let's go.
Please, Gilles. Go and see.
Where's my husband?
He's dead!
Good.
Well done.
I have to go.
You know what to do?
I'll clean up.
After, you call the police.
Say you found it like this.
They'll never prove it.
I'll take this.
I want it!
Melinda got it for her birthday.
She won't be needing it.
Bye now!
Oh, shit!
The car was right in the middle
of the road with no lights on.
It was too late to avoid it.
The poor thing!
It was clearly not your fault, Father.
It was just fate.
The poor child!
What's this?
A radio.
You think now's the time, Crenn?
Please, Gilles. Go and see.
Where's my husband?
He's dead!
Well done.
