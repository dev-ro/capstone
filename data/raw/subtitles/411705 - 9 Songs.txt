9 SONGS (2004)
When I remember about Lisa,
I don't think about our clothes
or her work, or where she was from
or even what she said.
I think about her smell, her taste
her skin touching mine
The first time I met her...
... it was at the Brixton Academy
[B.R.M.C. (Black Rebel Motorcycles Club)
- Whatever Happened To My Rock 'N' Roll ]
One, two, three...
You was a part of me
You want the whole thing
You want to feel something more
than I could ever bring
You want it badly
You want it tangled
I want to feel something more
than I was strangled
I fell in love
with the sweet sensation
I gave my heart
to a simple chord
I gave my soul
to a new religion
Whatever happened to you?
Whatever happened to our
rock 'n' roll?
Whatever happened to my rock 'n' roll?
She wants it hollow
She wants it tainted
She wants to feel something
more than she was naked
You want to hide away
You're scared to touch it
I want to feel something more than
I care to take. I fell in love
with the sweet sensation
I gave my heart
to a simple chord
I gave my soul
to a new religion
Whatever happened to you?
Whatever happened
to our rock 'n' roll?
Whatever happened
to my rock 'n' roll?
You can't have it
crying.
Neither with your disguise.
Was so sweet, yes.
She's not the leader
of religion.
Go save your soul, ok.
Where are you going?
I have a meeting this morning.
An appointment
with my supervisor.
The Antarctica
13,800,000  square kms of ice.
A continent of ice.
A place where no man had ever been
until the 20th century.
[The Von Bondies - C'mon C'mon ]
On another day. C'mon, c'mon
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong?
Now we grieve
cause now is gone
Things were good
when we were young
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood of a thousand men
who have come and gone
Now we grieve
cause now is gone
Things were good
when we were young. Is it safe to say?
C'mon, c'mon.
Was it right to leave?
C'mon, c'mon.
Will I ever learn?
C'mon, c'mon.
C'mon, c'mon.
As I make my way-
C'mon, c'mon.
These better nights that seem
too long
Now we grieve
cause now is gone.
Things were good
when we were young
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone
Now we grieve
cause now is gone
Things were good
when we were young
Is it safe to say?
C'mon, c'mon.
Was it right to leave?
C'mon, c'mon.
Will I never learn?
C'mon, c'mon.
C'mon, c'mon.
Is it safe to say?
C'mon, c'mon.
Was it right to leave?
C'mon, c'mon.
Will I never learn?
C'mon, c'mon.
C'mon, c'mon.
And know this day these deepened wounds
don't heal so fast.
Can't hear me croon
of a million lies that
speak no truth
of a time gone by
that now is through
Oh Baby, pay attention to me..
I was gonna make you breakfast
Ah, yes.
Fuck me
- Fuck you?
- Please...Please?
- Say again, again..Again?
- Please!
Sit
Come here
Fuck me
Fuck me
Let me inside you
Do it faster.
Fuck me faster.
Come inside me!
Come inside me! Come on....!
Coffee?
Yeah...
- Why not?
- I will put it back on you
Do you think I look like a boy?
Yeah, that's why I like ya
Boy?
Girl?
I have really big muscles
They're like wings!
You look like an angel
There's a big clog
Only unhappy people have had dances
- How does American dance?
- Like this
Um...Turn around
Like this?
I even went to Brazil
They dance like this, they can't help it!
This is how we dance raves in America
This is how we dance in England
That's fantastic
Think we'll ever make love
without using a condom?
No!
Why? I did all the test...
make sure I am clean
I know
But I like better this way
I'm going to take a bath
Yeah...you should do, you stink.
Hi, Natasha.
Um, last night was fine
I just kinda finished work and came home.
What happened to you?
Um.mm! You always get good boys..!
Um..What's his name?
Well... I'm going to work at six
Yah...I'll see you then..
OK..
Bye..
Natasha always comes back with these ridiculous stories
about this really random men that she meets.
Really, really fucking weird men
The weirdest people come into our bar...
...the princes,
Sons of whoever and daughters of whoever
and their girlfriends
and boyfriends and prostitutes
and God knows what...
I went out with a guy
who always carried a briefcase with him
And rumor had it
that it was filled 20,000 Euros at all times.
Did you ever see the money?
I saw 10,000 of it.
[ Elbow - Fallen Angel ]
All the fallen angels
Roostin'
in this place.
Count back the weeks
on worried fingers.
Virgin mother,
whats'erface
You don't need
to sleep alone.
You bring the house down.
Choose your favourite shoes
And keep your blues
on cruise control.
All the gelded mongrel
Bear their teeth for you
Drag your feathers
'cross the dancefloor.
Throw your shapes
electric blue
You don't need
to sleep alone.
You bring the house down.
Choose your favourite shoes
And keep your blues
on cruise control.
- Woman
- Man

Yeah!
[ Franz Ferdinand - Michael ]
So sexy.
You're sexy. Come and
dance with me
Those glasses are so ugly...
I'm trying to look ugly.
Well, you look stupid
Tryin' to look stupid.
So close now.
Come dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Michael, you're a boy
with all the leather hips.
Sticky hair, stickyhips, stubble on my sticky lips
Michael, you're the only...
I've had one from Colombia
one from Brasil,
one from Argentina
one from Germany,
when I was in highschool
And I..have....an English boyfriend
Ahh...isn't this romantic?
Beautiful morning...
No it's not....it's gray
Hang on..
I don't want to be scared..
The only reason I would swim in there
is if I really loved it.
That so boring!
I don't think this is a nude beach.
Matt, don't go in the water, it's cold
I can't take you anywhere!
I love you!
I love you!
[ Primal Scream - Movin' on Up ]
I was blind,
now I can see.
You made a believer, out of me
I was blind,
now I can see
You made a believer,
out of me.
I'm movin' on up now
Gettin' out
of the darkness
My light shines on
My light shines on
My light shines on
I was lost,
now I'm found.
I believe in you,
I've got no bounds
I was lost
now I'm found.
I believe in the rock and roll
I got no bounds.
I'm movin' on
up now
Gettin' out
of the darkness
My light shines on
My light shines on
My light shines on
Shines
Shines
We like to shine.
Shines
Shines, shines.
Shines, shines.
Shines, shines.
Shines
Shines
Shines, shines.
Shines
Shines
My light shines on
The ice sheet can be 4 km deep
The ice found there can be
half-million years old.
The air trapped in the ice..
which caused the climate when the ice was formed.
The Antarctic is the planet's memory
a memory of time before there were people.
She's 21, beautiful, egotistical
careless and crazy
Hey!
listen to this
"Immediately after undressing
I was a little embarrass to discover that I had a hard-on.
And I lay down on my stomach beside her
one of them have shaved their pubic hair
And you can easily make out her slender,
delicate slit.
'I really go for that type of pussy'
Vallery said in a low voice.
"It makes you feel like
slipping a finger inside.
"As she lay down...
I can make out of the
thick plump lips of her pussy "
"I heard footsteps approaching
across the sand
and I closed my eyes again. "
It sounds very hard on your skin
Don't wave that belt on my face
You know I got hurt once
while waving a belt in my face
Oh..no, don't put my stockings on
No..I can't see..
Forget who you are ...
Forget where you are...
You're in a beach in San Juan.
Your eyes are closed
So you can't see them
You feel them watching you
There's a couple behind me
Am I right?
I can feel them looking at me
I put my hand between my legs.
I am so wet.
And she slides down her boyfriend body
she has most amazing breasts
And she's rubbing them
And she's covered with oil
She leans toward ...to her..
her boyfriend
Grabs his balls
Puts his cock in her mouth ...
Fuck me, Matt.
Come up here and Fuck me
Come up!...come up here...
... Fuck me!
Matt,
Fuck me.
Fuck me.
Fuck me faster.
Fuck me!
Fuck me!
Faster!
Fuck me!
Fuck me faster!
Good.
Fuck me!
[ Dandy Warhols - You Were The Last High ]
I am alone but adored
By a hundred thousand more.
Then I sin,
when you were
the last.
And I have know love,
like a whore, from
at least ten thousand more.
Then i swore, when you
were the last
When you were the last
high.
You were awake
And I should've stayed,
But wondered
I was only out for a day
Out for a day.
It was Chicago
for a moment,
and then it was
Paris and London for
a few days.
I told I'm alone,
but adored
by a hundred thousand more.
Then I swore when
you were the last
You were the last high
Thanks for supper
No problem
So listen, it's Thanksgiving tomorrow
I know
We should do something
I've got some dinner plans
with some friends of mine from America
You'd hate it.
It's really good though
Do it harder
Massage my pussy
Sometimes when you kiss me
I just wanna bite you
Not in a nice way, like I wanna hurt you
Like I wanna bite your lips really fucking hard
and make you bleed
Um..that's him
- You gonna talk?
- Um.... I just gonna go right out
Ok.
See you in a bit.
[ Goldfrapp - Horse Tears ]
The night has fallen
mute and cold.
My horse is crying
But you know
all this time
But you know
all this time
that you'd never want
keep you still
Dare to come
But you love me,
still.
But you love me
Tears too cold
OK?
Lisa didn't want to go to the
gig that night,
so I gave her ticket away.
Five thousand people in the room and
you can still feel alone.
[ Super Furry Animals - Slow Life ]
Move you
Buy and sell you
Terrorise you.
Mass destruct
you.
Flaunt you.
Disconnect you
Cluster fuck you
We will crush you
Rocks are slow life
Rocks are slow life
Rocks are slow life
Rocks are slow life
Rocks are slow
life...
Did you put sugar in my tea?
Possibly
I don't like sugar in my tea
It's good for you, it'll pick you up.
I don't wanna be picked up.
You're not gonna drink your tea?
It's too hot.
And it's got sugar in it.
You are so boring today!
Bo-ring
Bo-Boring Bo-ring
There's someone named Bo...Boring
Boderick
You're so fucking interesting when you start taking pills at this time of day.
You know what?
I haven't even taking any fucking pills at this time of the day
I took my prescription pill
that I take everyday, that I have been taking
since you've fucking met me
I didn't take any of those pills.
Did you see me taking any of those pills?
You've been sitting right in front of me, are you sitting in front of me not looking at me?
Don't pay any fucking attention to me?
Hey
Hi
I brought you a present
Fuck me?
Just Kidding
[ Elbow - I've Got Your Number ]
Don't put this note
by your face on the pillow
Don't put this letter
on the pocket near
to your heart
Keep it in the bottom drawer
where you hide the sex tools
I pray you always need them
I
know what
you
have done.
- Do my nipples feel sore to you?
They are.
Really?
[ Franz Ferdinand - Jacqueline ]
Jacqueline was seventeen
Working on a desk
when Ivor
peered above a spectacle.
Forgot that he had wrecked
a girl.
Sometimes these eyes
forget the face they're
peering from
when the face
they peer upon
Well, you know
that face as I do.
And how in the return
of the gaze
She can return you the face
that you are staring from
It's always better
on holiday
So much better on holiday
That's why we only work
when we need
the money.
It's always better
on holiday
So much better on holiday
That's why we only work
when we need
the money.
Gregor was down
again. Said:
"Come on, kick me again". Said:
"I'm so drunk.
I don't mind if
if you kill me
Come on you, gutless
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
and how i know it
But for chips and for freedom
I could die."
It's always better
on holiday
So much better on holiday
That's why we only work
when we need
the money.
It's always better
on holiday
So much better on holiday
That's why we only work
when we need
the money.
Exploring the Antarctic is almost
like exploring space.
You enter a void
Thousand of mile with no people..
no animals...
...no plants...
You're isolated on a vast...
empty continent
Claustrophobia and Agoraphobia
in the same place
like two people in a bed
We spend my birthday in the hotel
where friend of Lisa's worked
Lisa gave me a book on the Antarctic as my present.
The Ice is everywhere and everything
It spreads to all sides, an unbounded void of
alien whiteness in geometric rigor.
Antarctic is the highest,
windiest, driest continent.
Its topography and dynamics
is simpliest on earth
An exercise of reductionism
The iceberg is the microcosm
of Antarctica
It's a fragment torn loose from the
continent, both substance and symbol
within its ice the burg contains
record of all ice terrains
As it moves away from the massive ice
it gradually disintegrates
Most burgs will last less than
two month in an open sea.
So your back goes like that
It's just this, back and forth
But you have to move your ass more
- Do you love it?
- Turn around
Bend over.
What time is it?
I don't know.
Have a light?
That's so attractive.
Yeah, I got it.
We'll save the rest for later
It was Michael Nyman's
60th birthday concert
That was the night she told me
she's going back to America.
You look like a ganster like that.
Trying look like a gangster.
You look ugly.
Trying look ugly.
It's just for a year..hm..?
Sometimes you have to
have faith in people.
- You miss me?
- Always
There's only a week
before her flight to home
She was like a tourist on holiday in London
she bought souvenirs
and Christmas presents
She was happy to be leaving.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!
One, two, three!
Like this?
- Yeah.
- I see in your future...
Hey
The day she left was the first time
she invite me to her apartment
She didn't want me to come to the airport or
to the station with her
She didn't want any long goodbyes
When you fly over the continent
you see the journey of the ice in reverse
The sea, the Iceberg, the sea ice,
the ice shelf and the ice sheet.
Each year the Ice inches its way
from the heart of the continent
to the sea into which, it finally melts.
It's beautiful!
[ Black Rebel Motorcycles Club - Love Burns ]
You might know this one.
Never thought I'd
see her go away
She learned I loved her today
Never thought I'd
see her cry
And I learned how to
love her today
Never thought
I'd rather die
Then try to keep her
by my side.
Now she's gone love
burns inside me
Now she's gone love
burns inside me
Now she's gone love
burns inside me
Nothing else can
hurt us now
No loss, our love's been
hung on a cross
Nothing seems to
make a sound
And now it's all
so clear somehow
Nothing really
matters now
Now we're gone and on our way
Now she's gone love
burns inside me
Now she's gone love
burns inside me
Now she's gone love
burns inside me
She cuts my skin and
bruise my lips
She's everything to me
She tears my clothes
and burns my eyes.
She's all
I want to see
She brings the cold
and scars my soul
She's heaven sent to me
Now she's gone love
burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns
inside me.
Now she's gone love
burns inside me.
I never will believe that I left
you that way I did.
Kiss my love and wish
you
go.
Can kiss my love and
wish you go.
I never will believe that I left
you that way I did.
Can kiss my love and
wish you go.
Can kiss my love and
wish you go.
Now she's gone love
burns inside me
Now she's gone love
burns inside me
Now she's gone love
burns inside me
