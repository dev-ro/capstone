FRAME OF MIND.
YOU' RE JUST A REGULAR
HARDSHIP CASE.
SOMEONE ALWAYS TRYING

OR GIVE YOU FIRST AID.
ALWAYS FEELING SORRY
FOR YOURSELF.
IF I DON'T,
NOBODY ELSE WILL,
AND YOU' RE JUST
AN ALL-DAY SUCKER, BITCH.

I'VE GOT MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS TO DO.
MY HAIR IS FALLING OUT.
SIL, MAN, HE'S BLEEDING.
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO KICK
THE SON OF A BITCH
IN HIS DAMN HEAD?
SIL, YOU'D BETTER COME OVER HERE
AND SEE ABOUT YOUR NEPHEW.
CAN'T YOU SEE
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN?
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE RUN
HIS DAMN MOUTH SO MUCH.
GIVE ME $15 FOR THE MOTOR
AND A SHIRT FOR COLLATERAL,
AND IT BE SLICK.

SHAKE A HAND
IF YOU CAN.
BE TRUTHFUL TO ME.
I'LL BE TRUTHFUL TO YOU.
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU SO,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
SO LET'S CALL IT A DAY.
I SAID ALL I HAVE TO SAY,
EXCEPT DON'T FORGET TO PRAY
AND SHAKE A HAND EVERY DAY.
THROW MY GODDAMN SHADES DOWN.
THROW MY GODDAMNED SHADES.
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT LIVING
WHEN I CATCH YOU.
THE ONLY THING
THAT LOOKS GOOD DYING
IS A ROSE.
HEY, TRUMAN DOYLE.
TRUMAN DOYLE, WAIT A MINUTE.
HEY, TRUMAN DOYLE.
IS THAT YOU, MAN?
WHO THE SHIT

OOH, THAT HIDES
THE GLOW OF A ROSE,
WHAT GOOD AM I?
HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS.
LORD, THIS BITTER EARTH,
YES, CAN BE SO COLD.
TODAY YOU' RE YOUNG.
TOO SOON YOU' RE OLD.
BUT WHILE A VOICE
WITHIN ME CRIES,
I'M SURE SOMEONE
MAY ANSWER MY CALL,
AND THIS BITTER EARTH,
OO-OO-OO-OO-OOH,
MAY NOT, OH,
BE SO BITTER AFTER ALL.
MEMORIES THAT JUST

RABBIT SKIN STRETCHED
ON THE BACKYARD FENCES,

MOT DEAR, MOT DEAR, MOT DEAR
DRAGGING HER SHADOW

ON THE RIM, THAT'S ALL.
I AIN'T GOT NO SPARE.
WE'LL RIDE BACK
ON THE RIM.
STAN JR. DONE LEFT
THIS HOUSE OPEN.
I'M GONNA
KILL THAT BOY.
IT'S GONNA RAIN.
AND THE ROOF
STILL NEEDS FIXING.
DADDY, WHAT MAKES THE RAIN?
WHY, IT'S THE DEVIL
BEATING HIS WIFE.
IS THAT ALL I GET?
HMM.
STAN JR.?
STAN JR.
YOU KNOW YOU HEAR ME
CALLING YOU, BOY
I KNOW THAT BOY HEARD ME
CALLING HIM.
OH, GIRL.
WELL, WELL.
LOOK WHO'S VISITING.
HONEY, TELL ME WHY
YOU' RE WEARING
THAT PRETTY SMILE
ON YOUR FACE.
WELL, SHE'S GONNA
HAVE A BABY.
I THOUGHT HER OLD MAN
WAS SHOOTING BLANKS,
BUT I SEE HE'S DROPPING BOMBS
ON OCCASION, I GUESS.
THIS BITTER EARTH,
WELL, WHAT FRUIT IT BEARS.
WHAT GOOD IS LOVE,
MMM, THAT NO ONE SHARES?
AND IF MY LIFE
IS LIKE THE DUST,
OOH, THAT HIDES
THE GLOW OF A ROSE,
WHAT GOOD AM I?
HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS.
LORD, THIS BITTER EARTH...
YES, CAN BE SO COLD.
TODAY YOU' RE YOUNG.
TOO SOON YOU' RE OLD.
BUT WHILE A VOICE
WITHIN ME CRIES,
I'M SURE SOMEONE
MAY ANSWER MY CALL,
AND THIS BITTER EARTH,
OO-OO-OO-OO-OOH,
MAY NOT, OH,
BE SO BITTER AFTER ALL.
I'M JUST GOING HOME.
I'M JUST GOING HOME.
GOING HOME.
