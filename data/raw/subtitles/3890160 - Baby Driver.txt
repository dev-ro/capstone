LAWYER: How would you describe your
relationship with the defendant?
DEBORA: We were friends.
And I think we both wanted
to be more than that.
He got himself
into a bad spot.
I was just
trying to get him out.
I believe the defendant
is of good character.
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.
CARJACK LADY:
Was the strangest thing.
He finally drove off,
and he threw
my purse right at me.
Then he actually said,
"I'm sorry."
LADY TELLER: He looked at
me and he shook his head,
like he was warning me, somehow
telling me not to go inside.
He looked concerned,
like he was, uh, trying to save me.
INTERPRETER: He made a mistake
when he was younger,
and it's haunted him
ever since.
When he tried to get out,
he was pressured even harder.
It was never his fault.
He's got a good heart.
Always had. Always will.
JUDGE: With regard to
counts 1 through 19,
and count 21,
I hereby
sentence the defendant
to 25 years in
the federal penitentiary,
subject to a parole hearing
after five years served.

SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
You got a letter, kid.
DEBORA: Hey, Baby.
You know, it's funny.
Even though I heard it so
many times in the court case,
I still can't get used to the fact
that your real name is Miles.
It's a cool name, though.
I can think of a lot
of great Miles songs.
But we still have to get through
all those Baby songs first.
I can't wait until
the day when it's just us,
music and the road.
See you later, Baby.
All my love, Debora.
