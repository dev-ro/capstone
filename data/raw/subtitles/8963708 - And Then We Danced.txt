From the top.
Stop. Stop!
You should be like a nail.
Start over.
Come on. Focus now.
Three, four. Go.
You're too soft.
You need to be more
like a monument, OK?
And your eyes are too playful.
Your gaze should be here.
Understood?
They must convey purity.
Virginal innocence.
Did I say something funny?
There is no sex
in Georgian dance.
This isn't the lambada.
Hello.
Who are you?
I'm Irakli, the replacement dancer.
Replacement for who?
Go stand over there.
From the top.
Get over here.
What is this?
It's an earring.
Do you know where you are?
The Georgian National Ensemble.
So take it off!
Just go stand over there.
Where are you from?
Where are you from?
Batumi.
Show me what you got.
Do the Adjarian duet.
Go.
Get ready.
Four.
- Hey, can you watch out?
- I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Mr. Shalva, could I get
half of my salary early?
No.
- It's really an emergency.
- Get to work, we have customers.
Dick!
- Hello.
- And our beers?
I'll bring them now.
What the fuck is his problem?
- They want to get drunk.
- The fuck with them.
- How many?
- Three.
I'll take it out.
Thanks.
What is this? Take it,
I'm telling you.
You gave me enough.
Thank you.
I'm leaving.
Be a good boy.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I need some potatoes.
That's enough.
- Is everything good at home?
- Yes.
- Bye.
- See you.
It sounded like a circus
in there again tonight.
Come on Aurora, lay off it.
Lay off it? The whole damn yard
knows her business!
I'm home!
What happened?
Careful,
so she doesn't wake up.
I told you not to bring
any leftovers!
What have you told that woman?
Does she think we are poor?
What does it matter? It's a shame
to throw it away, that's all.
What kind of potatoes
do you bring home?
Those were the best ones, sorry.
The dead have arisen.
- Mom, can I have some coffee?
- Now?
I don't want you up all night
sleeping all day.
Take out the bread instead.
- Where is your brother?
- You tell me.
What?
You put on such a scene,
the whole neighborhood heard you.
It's not paid yet.
He wouldn't give me an advance.
Some pocket change I got in tips.
Why don't you ask your Lasha
to help us?
I can't, his father is sick.
Of course you can't.
But when he needs you
to clean his home, you're there.
Are you his cleaning lady?
Yes, Mom, I'm his cleaning lady.
You know what?
He should marry you.
Then you can go live with him,
and we can both finally rest.
Dear Lord, what days we've lived.
Get up. Let's go.
Your brother just got home.
I know Aurora,
thank you for the newsflash.
- He woke me up!
- Good.
- Hurry up.
- Gotta take a dump.
Then let me go first.
Knock it off!
Hurry up!
Stop banging,
you'll wake up your mother.
I'm not feeling well.
Got the runs.
I'll meet you there.
Stop fooling around,
go with your brother now.
Fine, Grandma.
- Lend me 10 lari.
- I don't have anything.
- Stop it! Let go!
- What the fuck is this?
I'm going to buy Mary a milkshake.
I'll buy everyone milkshakes tomorrow.
Go fuck yourself.
Look at those tits.
Do you know how much
these main ensemble guys get paid?
Plus, they get to travel
the whole damn world.
Continue.
From the top.
What is your name?
Merab Lominadze.
Are you Ioseb's son?
Yes.
How is he doing?
Fine, I guess.
Where does he work now?
At the Eliava Bazaar.
I see...
And what is your name?
Mariam Kipiani.
When did you start dancing together?
We got paired when we were 10.
What is Georgian dance?
Tradition?
Georgian dance isn't just about
achieving perfection.
It's the spirit of our nation.
Alright.
The main ensemble
is looking for a dancer.
Quiet down.
A male!
They'll let us know how many of you
they want for the auditions.
Let's go again.
- Excuse me.
- What?
When will the auditions be held?
Soon enough.
Take your positions!
Three, four!
This new boy is so strange.
Just asking Aleko questions like that.
I agree.
You know why the main ensemble
needs a replacement, right?
- Why?
- They kicked Zaza out.
- Zaza?
- Why?
There was a scandal
when they performed in Yerevan.
What scandal?
Some of the guys beat him up real bad.
He could barely walk.
What happened?
They caught him having sex.
With a man. And an Armenian!
Who told you that?
My cousin. Why?
Don't you believe me?
His family sent him off
to a monastery,
way up in the mountains.
You can barely drive there.
Why did they send him there?
What do you mean?
To make him normal again, of course.
- Is the smell gone?
- No.
You guys remember crazy Marina?
She's still alive.
I hadn't seen her in two months.
I was on my way,
she fell so I helped her up.
She sees my muscles and says:
"You must jerk off a lot!"
You know why she walks like this?
Cause Rati's grandpa used to bang her
three times a day!
- You're Irakli, right?
- Yes.
Have you been to Roena's brothel?
No.
No?
She's got some new Ukrainian chicks.
Why don't we go
and check them out?
I can't, I got a girl in Batumi.
Really? Is she any good?
What did you say?
Say it again!
- Come on man, he has a girlfriend.
- I got it.
Sorry, I was just fooling around.
Peace man, no offense.
- Rati?
- What?
Fuck off!
You never learn!
Where are you going?
Their electricity got turned off.
I told your brother
to go talk to your father
to see if he can help us.
He reacted as if I'd asked him
to go kill someone.
I can't bare being without light.
How's Mary these days?
I don't know. She's good I guess.
You know, maybe I could talk to Irina
ask for more shifts at the store.
She might agree if you stop
fighting with everybody.
Don't start, Mother.
This reminds me
of Shevardnadze's time.
Do you remember?
Give me your other dance shoes,
I'll repair them too.
OK.
Emotional, fiery with temperament,
but most importantly,
his dance had a story behind it.
His dance was spiritual.
He wasn't just dancing,
each one of his moves had a narrative.
Ms. Mzia?
Can you let me in?
You're doing it wrong.
You keep landing wrong on this leg.
You'll hurt yourself.
You need to straighten this.
How long have you been dancing?
Since I could walk.
You?
Since I was 13.
What?
Nothing. Gotta take a piss.
See you later.
Take a break.
Take a break.
Irakli.
You'll do the Adjarian duet
from now on.
Take your place, now.
Three,
four...
My aunt brought them from London.
Keep them.
Thank her for me.
They're much better than ours.
They taste different.
According to my dad,
we get the bad cigarettes
the Europeans won't smoke.
I can't wait to go back to London.
Do you think Aleko
will change his mind?
We've been rehearsing that routine
for a year.
I don't know.
He's Adjarian, the dance fits him.
So you think he's better than me?
No, all I'm saying is,
that he is different.
That's all.
Yeah, right.
Don't forget these.
You can keep your fancy cigarettes.
What's wrong with him?
Is he pissed about being replaced?
They're from London!
- Do you want a milkshake?
- No.
If you only knew how amazing
the milkshakes are in London.
You'd go crazy.
My favorite is salted caramel.
It's the best.
It's both salty and sweet.
It's delicious.
There is this small cafe...
Hello.
Do you know where Ioseb has his spot?
Straight down and to the right.
Thank you.
Listen to this girl
rather than your grandma.
It's really tough to dance
and study at the same time.
But I think it's really important.
What? I told you 10 times
to enroll with me this semester.
Listen, son.
I never wanted this life
for you or your brother.
There's no future in Georgian dance.
Do you want to end up like me?
I guess not.
Being a dancer is a dog's life.
You destroy your body.
For what? So you get to perform
at La Scala once?
You performed at La Scala?
No.
- But his grandmother did.
- Really?
She never told me.
His mother and I danced
at Royal Albert Hall.
Seriously?
You don't know anything, do you?
- Sorry.
- Everyone knows except for him.
Great.
I only knew about The Metropolitan.
Stop squabbling.
Fine, alright.
Do you want a sip?
What is this?
The main ensemble has lost
a male dancer.
And?
So they're looking for a replacement.
And so?
I'm going to apply.
Boy! It's not for you.
Don't you understand?
Your brother, however,
if he cared enough...
So I'll practice everyday.
You'll need to practice 24/7.
Fine!
What do you want from me?
I could make some calls
and talk to Aleko.
Aleko couldn't care less
what you have to say.
I don't want you to waste your time,
that's all.
Do you need money?
No.
Give this to your mother.
This is all I have right now.
Your brother got the electricity back.
God bless him.
I know a guy who works there.
He helped me out.
- What did you do?
- Don't worry, brother.
My baby boy.
Where did that woman
put the nuts?
They're over here.
If you miss another rehearsal,
you're out.
I don't care.
What about the pay?
What pay? Are you kidding me?
- I'm going out!
- Alright.
Eat up.
Come on, eat up.
Hey.
Sorry about the dance thing.
Not my fault.
Yeah, whatever.
Listen, I'll come with you
to the studio now.
OK.
But help me get my brother up.
Or he won't come at all today.
David.
David.
Wake up boy!
Get up!
Hey, cool posters.
Get up!
It's the same as your tattoo.
I gotta puke!
Listen, Aleko will kill you
if you don't come today.
Go and I'll meet you there.
Who is this boy your brother
brought home?
Mind your own business!
Hello,
I'm Irakli. Nice to meet you.
What a nice young man!
- What a sweet lady!
- Are you kidding me?
It looks good.
Wait...
I'm so hungover!
Fuck, I lost my earring.
It might be in the locker room.
Maybe in your bag?
Does Ninutsa have a boyfriend?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
I think she's into me.
Not like that.
I really like her.
I'd like to take her out sometime.
Forget about it.
She only likes
really expensive places.
Then I'm fucked.
Why?
I send home all the money I make.
My dad's lungs are failing.
He used to work in construction.
My dad used to work
in construction too.
Are you and Mary a couple or what?
Something like that.
How did you get this scar?
I was dropped as a baby.
- Seriously?
- Seriously.
I've always had it
and my parents won't say a word.
So I think they dropped me.
And now,
they're too ashamed to tell me.
- But I like it.
- I like it too.
I just meant that it suits you.
Everybody, get in line.
- Where is David?
- He is sick.
Is he dying?
I don't know.
What?
No.
Tell him that if he skips
one more class, he's out.
- Can I dance now?
- No.
I was told by Mzia
that you and the new boy
have been rehearsing.
He is very gifted, don't you think?
Look me in the eye.
I guess.
You're smart.
Trying to learn from someone
better than you.
Good then.
You two will do the Kintouri duet.
But,
what about me sir?
It's my only duet.
Go ask David.
But why am I being punished?
Did I say you could talk?
No.
Then step back.
I'm stepping back.
Let's go!
This hand of yours needs to...
Quiet down.
Beso has selected the dancers
for the audition.
After consulting with me of course.
Quiet!
Gela.
Vakhtang.
Be quiet.
Luka.
Quiet!
Irakli.
And Merab.
That's it.
There is one hour of rehearsal left.
From the top.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Three...
What's happening Merab?
How did it go Merab?
This is how he looked.
So did you!
Check out the tourists.
They're watching a group
that can't even dance.
Let's show them.
Come on, let's go!
Thank you.
This bread is to die for.
Get up, let's go.
- Where?
- Let's go.
- Where to?
- To the park.
Why do you want to go there?
Where did you get that?
- Ninutsa gave it to me.
- What?
So what? Sopo is doing it too.
Seriously?
Does Sopo have a boyfriend?
What do you care?
Why not?
Listen,
the first time should be special.
Not just anywhere, in some park.
Fine. Whatever you say.
- Eat up.
- I'm fine.
Poor you.
Sopo, should we take you home?
We're going tomorrow, right?
Definitely.
Come here.
- Which way are you?
- Sevastopol Street.
We're going the same way then.
This used to be an Armenian cemetery.
Really?
Yes. Oh shit.
What?
- I forgot something!
- What?
Hurry up!
Wake up, Grandma.
Sweet boy.
Are you hungry?
- Who is this nice boy?
- This is Merab.
- He's my friend.
- Good boy.
- He dances too?
- Yes, very well.
I will have a fig, then some jam.
Givi.
Merab.
Why haven't I met him before?
I didn't know him then.
Merab.
Merab.
If I repeat your name,
I'll memorize it.
Merab!
Where were you last night?
Out drinking.
We got wasted and came home.
It's not healthy.
It was just this one time.
We're grown-ups.
Who is this boy?
I don't recognize him.
Merab, Grandma, Merab!
- Are you into soccer?
- I love it.
That's Messi, I like him a lot.
Yeah, I know who he is.
I don't know any
other players, though.
Shouldn't you fix these?
I use it when I dance at weddings.
Seriously?
You dance at weddings?
I do. What?
It pays really well.
Try it on.
No, I'm good.
- Come on.
- No, I'm OK.
I'm begging you.
Look at little Aleko!
You know when Aleko gets mad,
he walks back and forth.
Then, he always starts to scream.
He is so neurotic.
"Do the Adjaruli."
He's actually very entertaining.
This is perfect for Georgian dance.
Do you want it?
Yeah, why not.
It's ancestral, you know.
Only one of us will be selected
for the main ensemble.
So you don't need to bother.
What "hm"?
They'll choose me for sure.
If you say so, the spot is all yours.
Why not though?
Well, I guess...
You're up against me so...
Seriously though,
we should rehearse this weekend.
Definitely. In the morning.
- In the morning of course, when else?
- True.
Let's do it.
Last night was so amazing, right?
I danced so much, like a crazy person.
I had a great time.
I'm just...
I'm just really tired and all,
I can't wait
to lay down and crash.
Yeah.
I'm really tired too.
OK, I'll go then.
- I'll see you tomorrow at Mary's.
- Ok.
He takes after his grandfather.
No, after his mother.
Leave the boy be. Let him eat.
He needs energy now
for the audition.
I'm off!
Don't stain your shirt.
Grandma, you're so beautiful.
And you have truly lost it
from all your practicing.
I need those for the eggplants.
Thank you for being
an amazing grandma.
Thank you
for being the best grandchild!
Although you're acting crazy.
I can't believe it!
No!
They always play this song
on the bus!
Do you know the lyrics?
Of course! Everyone does!
Come on! Sing along!
My darling, my angel,
the most beautiful...
My daughter.
I would like to toast to Mary
with all of you.
Cheers to Mary!
And cheers to youth!
- Cheers to you Mary!
- Thank you.
What's the latest with the Russians?
The border keeps moving.
That's what is happening.
Mary's family is pretty well off,
right?
They used to be pretty loaded.
But they still like to show off.
Keep this to yourself though.
I'll sleep on the floor.
You'll freeze to death!
Sleep in the bed.
Boys!
Do you guys need anything?
Are you guys that sleepy?
- Your hands are cold.
- Yes, I'm a little cold.
Look at them.
Let's go get some sleep too.
We're going.
- Sweet dreams, don't freeze.
- OK.
- See you tomorrow, Merab!
- See you!
What's wrong?
- Huh?
- What's up?
Nothing, I'm just tired.
Mary, is that you?
Get in here.
Yes.
Did I give you permission
to take the car
to go see that idiot father of yours?
Did I?
Calm down, I'll be right up!
Oh, did I tell you about Zaza?
- Yes.
- No, not the latest.
So apparently,
he escaped from the monastery.
The counseling priest
took advantage of him instead.
- What?
- He had sex with him.
Zaza managed to escape
but couldn't return home.
- He stands by the circus now.
- The circus?
Selling himself.
- Hey Granny!
- What's with you, have you lost it?
What do you want for breakfast?
I'm not hungry.
Dear God, have you gone mad?
Dear Lord...
Get the fuck out of here!
Leave now!
Out!
In this ensemble,
there is no room for criminals!
Is that understood?
Get ready!
I'm going to kill him!
What have you done?
Nothing. They can't prove shit.
How did you fix the electricity?
- I helped some friends out.
- What friends?
Are you deaf?
Use your head!
He never wanted us in the ensemble!
He hates Mom and Dad.
Don't you get it?
Wake up!
He is such a fucking asshole!
Can you get me work
at the restaurant?
Come on, man...
Come by this evening.
You're the best.
Hey, where were you today?
What did they say?
He'll put you on trial for five days.
Five days, seriously?
I can't do anything!
Take it or leave it.
No remaining balance.
Two eggplant rolls
without pomegranate,
just as you asked.
David?
Pardon me.
Can you watch my
tables for 30 minutes?
- I get the tips?
- Fine, but do a good job.
Go.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.
Speak to me normally.
- Tell him!
- Tell him what?
What happened?
I saw him buying drugs.
Bullshit!
Take your brother and get out!
- Is it true?
- Don't touch me!
This job is all we have!
How dare you?
I told you to get the fuck
out of my face!
Call the police!
Get out!
You're dead to me!
Dick!
Get out of here!
Don't touch me!
You too, get out!
- Please, I really need this job.
- Please?
- Leave!
- Go fuck yourself!
Excuse me!
Do you have one lari?
No brother! What lari?
Do you have one lari?
I really need to refill my phone.
Let me check.
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much!
Hey, what's up?
Why aren't you answering?
Hey.
Hey!
Can I bum a cigarette?
Thank you.
I saw you on the bus.
- Have you been crying?
- Me?
Never mind.
So what's happening?
I'm just waiting for some friends.
Fuck them, they're always late.
Let's go.
Come on!
This is my best friend's bar.
I'm always here.
It's gonna be so much fun!
Where the hell is this taxi?
I'm cold!
Is it coming?
Taxi!
Look at these fucking freaks.
We missed the exit,
but it's OK.
I need to get some money.
I'll ask Nata!
Get out, get out!
Nata!
Who is this faggot?
You whore!
- Where to, cunt?
- To Bassiani.
So what's up?
Cut it out.
Give me my money.
What money? I don't have any.
But when I warn you of the police,
you sing a different tune.
Bitch! Hand it over.
Lika, get over here.
- Spot me 40 lari.
- I'm broke. And you owe me a shaver.
You suck dicks all day
and you're still broke?
Shut up and give me what you have!
- Who's this boy?
- Merab.
I'm Likuna.
- Listen, I don't...
- Give me that!
Hello.
Excuse-me.
Hello.
Is Irakli home?
No, he's not. Who's asking?
I'm a friend.
Where is he?
He is in Batumi.
What's the matter?
Nothing's the matter...
When is he coming back?
How should I know?
I'm just the neighbor
helping out the old lady.
Right.
Thanks.
Stop.
Merab, stop. Enough.
Enough!
Merab!
Enough boy!
You're too heavy!
Did you drink water?
That's not the only thing
he's been drinking.
Am I talking to you?
Sorry, sir.
You can't drink water
before practice.
Show me a spin.
Ready.
Begin.
Stop.
Enough.
Merab, stop it!
It's enough!
Great!
- It hurts so bad!
- Keep still!
- Where does it hurt?
- My ankle.
It'll be alright.
Cold water is good for you.
Don't move for two seconds.
Don't move! Don't take it out!
Hey!
Can you hear me?
Irakli?
Hey man, sorry I didn't call.
I had no credit left.
I'm in Batumi.
My father is very sick.
Will you make it to the auditions?
I don't know...
Merab, can you hear me?
Yes.
Can you hear me?
Thank you for helping me.
It doesn't hurt anymore. I'll be OK.
Are you sure about that?
Do you want a milkshake?
Are you insane?
- Why?
- No thanks. Have a good one.
This life is not for everyone.
And considering your family history...
You know, Georgian dance
is based on masculinity.
The Kintouri and Adjarian routines
used to be softer
but we changed it fifty years ago.
There is no room for weakness
in Georgian dance.
Do you know
when Irakli will be back?
I don't think he'll be back.
He'll be back.
I'm very sorry about your foot.
We'll manage the rehearsals
and auditions without you.
I'll be fine.
I'll put some ice on it tonight
and practice on my own.
Can I go now?
Are you still going to audition?
Faggot! I saw you last night!
Come over here!
- Repeat that!
- I said I saw you!
- And?
- Your brother knows you're a fag?
Shut up!
You should tell him!
Get over here!
Bastard!
What's wrong with you?
Listen to me one second!
What places are you going to?
I can't believe you'd be so stupid.
Don't you know what happened to Zaza?
Why don't you get it?
They could finish you!
I'm not like Zaza!
Leave me the fuck alone!
Congratulations!
What the fuck now?
- Your idiot brother is engaged.
- What?
Great, pretend I'm not here.
- He got some girl pregnant.
- Who?
What's her name again?
Sopo! I already told you!
You fucking idiot!
How can we afford a wedding?
I don't know.
He claims her family has money.
The wedding is in two days.
It makes sense.
They want to save the girl's honor.
What choice do they have?
Do you love this girl?
Yes Grandma, I truly love her.
Where are you having the wedding?
In a restaurant.
We want a small gathering.
- Why?
- We don't want a big wedding.
We'll have a small party
at Sopo's house.
At her house?
Are they poor?
Are they wealthy or not?
Yes they are. Her father owns
a construction company.
I'll work for him.
What are you doing?
What's up with your foot?
Don't talk to me.
- I heard she's Armenian.
- Really?
- Who told you that?
- Aurora.
- Jesus Christ, Mom!
- Well, it could be true.
Who cares if it is?
When did you get back?
Just now.
I'm sorry I disappeared like that.
What the fuck?
From Adam and Eve's times,
the Lord identified Adam as a man
and Eve as a woman.
From then on, a man is a man,
and a woman is a woman.
But in these times
of "globalization," as they call it...
My darling boy.
Sorry. I'll call you right back.
- Sorry.
- It was just my mom.
When did you come back?
Like yesterday, sort of.
I ran into your brother on the street,
so he invited me.
What? You don't want me here?
Should I?
Of course not.
I want you here.
Easy. Someone could walk in.
I don't want that.
You only came back
for the auditions, right?
No.
I'm not going to audition.
What? How come?
Because I'm leaving Tbilisi.
That's why.
Because...
I had a girl in Batumi, remember?
Yeah.
Listen, my father is dying.
And my mother is all alone in Batumi.
The situation is really bad.
I'm all she has.
So I got engaged.
Really?
Congratulations.
I'll get going then.
Wait.
I found your earring.
You can take it.
I don't need it anymore.
Merab!
Wait!
Mary, I'm so sorry!
Please, forgive me.
I didn't understand.
What happened to you?
I got into a fight.
First Luka came at me
and then the rest of them.
- Do you want ice?
- No.
OK.
Luka said you're a faggot.
I had to protect your honor.
So, did I take a beating in vain?
Maybe.
You've always been better than me,
Merab.
I don't care what Dad used to say.
I will just end up
a drunk fat Georgian man
who works for his father-in-law.
But I'm fine with that.
You need to get out of Georgia, Merab.
You have no future here.
Do you understand?
Come here.
What? I want to see
what those old farts have to say.
They'll flip out if they see you.
I don't care. I'm done here.
An English cigarette?
Don't you ever run out?
You know what,
I ran out ages ago. So I put
Georgian cigarettes in the pack.
Are you serious?
What? It's like placebo.
It works.
I'll go inside.
Meet me here after?
I'll be waiting for you,
right here.
OK, I'll go inside now.
Thank you. It's enough.
Merab, we get it.
You can go now.
- What the hell is this?
- I'm not sure.
He is mocking Georgian dance!
Look at his hands!
