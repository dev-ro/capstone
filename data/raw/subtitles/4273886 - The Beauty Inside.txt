"NEXT ENTERTAINMENT WORLD presents"
"a YONG FILM production"
I need to be quick.
I can't be seen like this.
It always happens like this.
Woo-jin?
My hand was bigger than my face yesterday.
But today. . .
it's twice as big.
It's not that bad.
This is temporary.
It'll change tomorrow.
Man, woman, old man, child
and sometimes a foreigner. . .
I wake up to a different face every morning.
My eyesight and
voice varies
and I have to adjust to that every morning.
I don't know why this happened.
Nor how to go back
to normal.
I make furniture.
I design it
and make it alone.
It doesn't bother me.
Everything is possible
since you never have to show yourself
when you're online.
Sang-beck is the only friend I have.
Woo-jin. . .
Right?
There's a designer who can't decide on a knob
and the entire production is on hold. . .
You know who I'm talking about.
Listen, we're not making
royal furniture for the Queen .
Mr. Kim Woo-jin, designer of ALX!
Okay, I'll make up my mind .
Nice face by the way.
It'd be a waste not to have fun with it.
Let's go.
What. . .
Do you come here often?
Not really. My friend does.
I have a friend
whose face changes whenever he wakes up.
No way. . .
- What is your name?
- Kim Woo-jin .
Kim Woo-jin.
He wakes up a man or maybe a woman.
Sometimes an old man, and sometimes an old woman.
I'm serious!
- What do you do for a living?
- What's your job?
- I'm in public service.
- I'm a dentist.
A comedian.
So basically you can do a different guy every day.
That's not possible. . .
He lives on this very earth!
I have to wash my hands.
Sure, you can go.
Just leave your coat.
That must hurt.
Shall we go?
My skin was nice yesterday. . .
I can't even see anything today.
I can never fall in love
for I have a different face every single day.
That's it for today.
It all happened 1 2 years ago.

It was my 1 8th birthday.
What?
Who is this person?
Is it me?
I thought I was dreaming.
Welcome.
Mom . . . Mom. . .
"KlM WOO-J IN"
I don't. . .
Why did this happen?
I don't know. . .
Mom took me home,
not to the hospital.
She cried. . .
saying she's sorry.
"GRADUATION"
Obviously, I dropped out of school.
I was never allowed a normal life.
- May I help you?
- Sorry, I'll come later.
While my friends were
graduating and dating
I can't see clearly.
How about these?
I lived a different life.
A life that no-one would ever understand .
I was beginning to accommodate to my life style.
HeIlo, ma'am.
He came again.
Is Woo-jin here?
Of course he's not.
Please give this to Woo-jin.
He likes fishballs.
By the way, you gained weight.
Too much stress?
My childhood friend Sang-beck.
Raspberry wine goes perfect with this, right?
I once drank up
your raspberry wine with Woo-jin
and filled the empty jar
with cheap So-ju.
I apologize for that. . .
I mean So-ju. . .
Ma'am?
Who are you?
So ma'am . . . you're saying you're Woo-jin.
Woo-jin woke up as you. . .
So you're Woo-jin. . . What the heck am I saying?
Let me ask a few things.
What did we usually go to eat after classes?
Stir-fried rice cake.
- Spice Girls?
- Posh.
Starcraft?
Zerg.
- What is my favorite Zerg trick?
- Four Drones.
Damn it!
Who's my favorite Japanese actress?
Aoi . . .
- Sora.
- Aoi Sora, indeed!
How do you know that!
- Yo!
- Yeah?
Then . . .
he bursted into laughter.
So you woke up like this today?
Shouldn't you be at a PTA meeting?
And I laughed, too.
You idiot. So you're like this.
It's you. . . no one but my buddy, Kim Woo-jin.
I know.
What are you talking about?
I mean. . . you're my friend.
Friends for 1 5 years.
You know what? I'm really happy
that we are friends.
Couldn't be happier.
What's up with you?
What I mean is we've been best friends.
For 1 5 years! We've been through a lot.
So. . . for the sake of our friendship,
let me do you .
Are you crazy? Hell no.
I'm not crazy. Just do me once.
I've never seen a girl like you in my life.
And if you don't do me in that body,
you're making a huge mistake.
And I won't let you do that.
- So don't make a mistake.
- You're crazy. . .
- It's me, Woo-jin!
- And I am Sang-beck.
So please. . .
Shit, drop it. Fine. I was just kidding.
Fine. I'll drop it.
Just let me see your boobs.
Least you could do.
Wait. . . my eyes. . . they hurt. . .
Go away! Back off.
- Hold on for a second . . .
- Damn it. . .
Just once. . .
Woo-jin? Right?
Hey man.
Damn. . . I can't take it anymore.
God damn it.
I quit!
Why?
This is ridiculous. . . Look at this.
My company is copying your design!
Those cheating bastards.
They have zero creavity.
My friend's design!
I need something unique. . .
Haute-couture. . . ?
Haute. . . what? Hottie?
Everyone sits on a chair in a different position.
Some in the corner. . .
and the some on the edges.
How about making
a unique custom-made furniture for each customer?
We measure the body size and make it custom-made.
What do you think?
Sang-beck suggested we make our own brand .
Such a high-end concept. . .
You must be a genius.
We named it. . .
ALX.
Let's work together.
You design, I'll make and sell it.
How about that?
It felt right.
"TODAY"
Han!
What's up, dude?
HeIlo, sir.
How about merging furniture and home appliances?
Like a hidden oven inside a table or
a computer monitor popping out of nowhere!
Transformer style!
I'll design the furniture.
You just sell them, okay?
You're a genius in making furniture.
Like the angle of this knob.
It would be perfect if you adjust it just a tiny bit.
Your compliments hurt me.
Fine. I'll adjust it.
But please use less expensive materials. . .
Like the knob?
I chose one already.
I know you idiot. It's too expensive.
No, I'm the boss, here. Mr. employee, please.
I'm begging you.
Shit.
Oh you're a writer.
Do you usually cross your legs when you write?
I'm not sure.
You have rather long legs. . .
so this might not be the perfect choice.
I never knew my height had
anything to do with my chair.
Are you looking for a specific style?
A comfortable chair
with bright colors and arm rests.
Something like that?
This chair is made of a special type of wood.
It's made of the lumber
from old and abandoned ships.
Isn't it special?
Once a tree, then a ship,
and now a chair.
Are you looking for a specific design?
I sit in an unusual position when I work.
How should I put it. . . I sit as if I ride a horse.
So I want a chair
shorter than a stool but taller than a usual chair. . .
That's what I want.
Can l guess what you do?
You make furniture,
right?
I saw you choosing knobs earlier.
Do you know the brand ALX?
It takes a while to receive it,
but it's custom-made and they use good materials.
This is its website. You can order online.
Is this allowed?
Of course not.
I come here all the time.
How come I've never seen her?
It's made of oak.
And the leather makes it fashionable.
This one is made of teak wood .
So it's solid yet sophisticated.
Have a seat.
I went to see her every day.
Does it take long to finish your meals?
Do you change your position a lot?
Have you ever been to Myanmar?
This top plate is made of mango wood from Myanmar.
I would like to recommend this.
She would always treat me the same,
This is my card, please call me
if you have any questions.
for I was only a new customer to her.
Should I ask her. . .
Nevermind .
She won't recognize me tomorrow.
But my heart is telling me otherwise.
Of course I prefer being handsome
and younger
the better.
A tall and
"I . . . CAN'T"
handsome person. . .
"SPEAK TODAY."
HeIlo.
FINALLY!
YES!
People say true beauty Iies inside,
but first impressions are equally important.
May I help you? Are you looking for something?
I am. . .
May I help you?
Are you sure you're okay with a floor sample?
We can send you a new one in 2 days.
It's fine. lt took me a lot of
courage to get me this.
Okay then. I'll see you again.
Well. . . is this chair better
than the one you talked about?
Wood or
steel?
Steak or sushi?
Excuse me?
Sushi , l guess.
Good, hop in.
I love sushi, too.
Thanks but I can't.
I have to work all night. . .
It has to be today. . .
You need to eat anyways. . .
No, thank you.
Enjoy your sushi .
Wait!
The truth is. . .
I practiced this a lot.
Inviting you to dinner. . .
But. . . why today?
- We're not eating here?
- No.
I'd better get back to work.
I know a place much better than this!
87061 2-1 77541 6.
01 0 21 91 2431 ,
#27-1 2 Nonhyun-dong.
What?
My social security number, cell number. . .
I'm not a weird person.
You can check.
What's your number?
You will like that place.
Isn't this the ALX factory?
My boss adores this brand!
She reaIly wants them in our store.
I sent them tons of e-maiIs, but never heard back.
How about you?
I love them!
Your own uni¤ue furniture.
It's a bit expensive, though.
That's. . .
- inevitable.
- inevitable?
Do you work here?
I guess so.
Go ahead .
Can l?
Of course not.
I haven't had sushi in a while.
It's good.
- Can I borrow that?
- What?
This.
Is it okay to eat here?
Sure.
It's like the table's making the sound.
That's an idea.
A speaker inside a table
so when you touch a button
the table makes the sound!
Like a Transformer?
Would it be weird?
I'm so full.
It's pretty far, isn't it?
I should've drove.
This is me. See the persimmon tree.
- Call me.
- I will.
I'm home!
You're late. Dinner?
I ate. Something good .
With a man. I can so tell.
"DI NNER TOMORROW?"
"I FlNISH AT 6PM ."
"WILL BE THERE BY 6."
I'm staying up.
Why didn't I think of this before?
At least I know now.
Are you sure?
I'm never sleeping again.
What are we doing now?
Do you Iike music?
Wow. . .
you come here often?
Please, sit here.
Wood is a special thing.
That it can make a guitar
make this sound. . .
Ramirez.
Jose Ramirez. The brand of the guitar.
- Do you know this song?
- Yes.
I was surprised you chose this.
- Why?
- Well. . .
I feel like you are like me.
You wanted to come here again?
Bon appmtit!
Why do you always tie
your hair after the first bite?
It's like saying,
'Now I am really ready to eat.'
But what do you do here?
Something like designing. . .
Are you the designer?
Yes. . . me. . . yes.
Sure, I see.
Yes. . . Okay.
At least clean the table after eating. . .
How have you been?
I missed you a lot.
A love chair for the lovers.
They must go crazy at night.
Like this. . .
No. . . No. . .
Boobs. . .
You thought I'd never
eat the leftovers like this.
You're wrong, my friend.
This is good .
No!
Don't. . .
I understand how it is. . .
Why do you keep calling? Let me sleep.
Tell me a funny story.
Go sleep, you moron.
I'm sorry.
I'm late.
It's fine. . . Maybe. . .
two hours?
Just like that. . . Right. . .
Just like that. . .
How do you know this place?
This place. . . soothes me.
They're rings?
Pretty.
You look like you're going to faint soon.
Like you haven't slept for days.
Didn't you sleep well last night?
I am alright.
Are you sure?
I am.
Tomorrow. . .
I need to go home early tomorrow.
Let's have breakfast then.
Did you sleep?
Yes? No. What?
This is a special gift from your dear sister.
What's this?
It's femidom .
- Femi . . . what?
- Femidom.
A female condom! You little teenager.
No, no, no! We're not like that.
Then why are you taking it?
You can be honest with me.
You feel only butterflies now
and you think it's true love.
Then bam! You do it!
Mister, are you already done?
- It can be like that.
- No way.
It's possible!
It's amazing.
It's like I've known him all my life.
Are you sleeping?
He seems a good man.
HeIlo! Wake up!
We're cIosing down.
I thought it would last forever.
I was wrong.
I promised to see her again
but she awaits yesterday's me.
Yes, boss.
When are the recruits coming?
Next week.
The resumes will come in soon.
I was just testing you .
By the way, where are you?
Sorry, I overslept.
Overslept?
I'll be there soon.
You better be.
Okay.
"HONG E-SOO"
This is the end .
"SORRY, CAN'T MAKE lT
TO BREAKFAST - WOO-J IN"
E-soo!
I am looking for something of antique style. . .
"WANTED: TEMPORARY STAFF"
"HONG E-SOO DELETE CONTACT?"
"WHAT'S UP W ITH YOU?
I WAITED QUITE A WH lLE."
She's waiting for me. . .
I can't disappear like this.
I would do anything for her.
I always knew. . .
the pretty ones are good at their jobs, too.
I just sent them e-mails. That's all.
Great!
E-soo, take care of training the recruits.
Yes.
Learn and work hard and
you'll be hired full-time in three months.
Yes!
You're good.
Where did you learn it?
My name is Han Chae-kyoung.
Nice to meet you, Chae-kyoung.
- Keep up the good work.
- Thanks.
By the way. . .
Nothing. Nice to meet you, too.
It gets better.
It's okay. I'm fine.
- Chae-kyoung, right?
- Yes.
Are you. . .
free after. . .
E-soo!
HoId on.
Talk to you later, Chae-kyoung.
- What is it?
- Boss wants to see you. . .
Gather around for wrap up.
Good job today, everyone.
See you all tomorrow with smiles. Thanks for today.
- Thank you.
- Thanks for today.
- See you tomorrow.
- Thank you.
See you all tomorrow.
Thank you.
Do you have dinner plans?
Aren't you hungry?
How about having dinner. . .
Do you have something to say?
Kim Woo-jin. . .
Do you remember him?
This is the first time someone's here.
Remember?
What are these?
Why are they at your place?
E-soo, listen to me first. Let me explain.
What are you , Chae-kyoung?
Please don't get me wrong.
Have you stalked me?
It's not like that. . . I just. . .
I better get going.
I am Kim Woo-jin!
Not. . .
Han Chae-kyoung, l am Kim Woo-jin.
I know that it sounds crazy,
but please look at this.
Hong E-soo.
I went there a lot, but I never saw her.
Her voice. . . Her eyes. . .
I can't get her off my mind.
Once a tree, now a ship. . .
then a chair.
We're very similar. That's it for today.
I haven't felt Iike this before.
It's a miracle that I stayed up for two days
and I don't know what will happen
but I don't care.
That's it for today.
They are. . .
all. . .
me.
I . . .
change every time I wake up.
So. . . all these different faces
and different bodies. . .
are Kim Woo-jin.
It doesn't make sense.
The chair made of an old ship,
the music we listened to at the factory. . .
And . . .
the antique shop. . . the Ramirez guitar. . .
I know it doesn't make sense
and that it sounds crazy.
But. . .
It's all me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I just wanted to tell you.
The truth.
Why are you doing this to me?
Let me show you the texts that you've sent me. . .
I don't ever want to see you again.
Please. . .
I've grown accustomed to that face
of unbelief.
I saw the same look in the mirror
the first day when I changed .
Then on mom's face
after she saw me that day
and later on Sang-beck's face.
Once again. . .
I am alone.
"CHANG ING APPEARANCES"
"EVERY TIM E YOU WAKE UP. . ."
Why so serious?
What are you searching for?
Sis.
Do you think transformation
is possible for humans?
Sure.
Look at those celebrities.
They show up with different faces in every season.
Giving excuses like they gained weight. . .
blah blah.
Are you still seeing him? Something's wrong?
I have no idea.
Why? What is it? Something happened¤ right?
Right? You did it?
No, it's not.
Actually. . .
I don't know. lt's complicated.
Go ahead .
We were waiting for you.
- Wonderful.
- We have sandwiches.
I want this table.
Where's the music coming from?
- Wow, it resonates.
- It's so beautiful.
Excuse me.
I bought a chair
and i'm Iooking for a table to match it.
The color of the chair is like brick.
I draw a lot so I want the table
to be large enough.
A large table would do.
Woo-jin?
Sorry?
Sorry about that.
I came to see
Kim Woo-jin.
Some tea?
Or anything else?
But you don't speak. . .
I can't speak Korean
but can understand it.
Are you really Woo-jin?
Yes, I am.
So. . .
You like me.
Maybe not.
I do like you.
Then let's sleep together.
I want to see it myself.
You changing into a different person.
Since when
did this begin?
Since I was 1 8.
Ever since.
I don't know
why it happened,
and I . . .
still don't.
How old are you?
The social security number, was it real?
I'm 2¤.
The number is real.
So we're the same age. lnteresting. . .
Will you ever die?
I don't know. l never tried.
Anything good about it?
Sorry?
- Right, you don't understand Japanese.
- Sorry.
It's really confusing.
Anything good about it?
I get dates when I'm handsome.
Why. . .
me?
I was used to this. My condition.
I was fine with it.
But since I met you
it became awkward
and painful.
I wanted to meet you
and talk to you.
I missed you.
But I couldn't.
That's why I told you.
Will you be okay
with what's about to happen?
Woo-jin. . . ?
You were Japanese. . .
It's a miracle for me to meet the same girl
for more than a week.
Really?
I met her everyday.
We'd taIk about the silliest things
and go to the craziest places.
Does it hurt?
Do you Iike it?
Well, not bad.
But I can't clearly see what's written.
Can you do it in Korean?
A day is too short. . .
I wanted this to last forever.
I was no longer alone in my pictures.
HeIlo?
God, you're a middle-aged man today.
Wow. Just look at that.
Hmm?
I just. . .
want to get familiar with today's Kim Woo-jin.
- Are you done?
- Nope.
It is so weird.
How can you be like a stranger every day?
Sorry.
- I have a question .
- Yes.
What appearance do you hate?
E-soo.
Could you . . . at least. . .
call me ma'am?
The one thing. . .
Want some fried beef?
- I do know is that E-soo
- No, I want the liver.
will be the most loved girl on the planet.
It's so soft. Try it.
You should say please'
when talking to older people.
- I told you to call me ma'am .
- Why should I?
- Do as I say!
- No, I won't!
Cheers.
Look out!
Cheers.
Your body can never lie, I guess.
I am so drunk already.
Woo-jin?
Good lord .
How much is it?
60 bucks.
I got this.
Here. What?
This one?
He's funny.
Is he your son?
He's my friend. . . 's son.
I feel safe around her.
I am no longer alone.
Hmm?
It's just. . .
your face changes every day.
So I need something to recognize you by. . .
your scent or touch. . .
I'll hold your hand like this.
I'll find you before you find me.
Ta-da!
You didn't eat, right?
No, I had something.
- Coffee.
- Oh please.
Too much of coffee isn't good for you.
It's delicious. Just like my mom's.
Isn't it?
My dad made it.
- And you. . .
- I packed them.
Sealed with all my love and care.
Sir.
That's it?
Indeed, sir.
Bon appmtit, sir.
Why do you call me sir?
It's just. . .
I look like a thug, don't l?
No, not really. . . yeah. . .
"SANG-BECK"
You reaIize you haven't completed the new line.
You gave me a sketch. That's alI.
I've been waiting for the samples for a month!
You're not the only one in a relationship.
I've been procrastinating. . .
You should work today.
I'll catch up on laundry, cleaning, and stuff.
You wanna come with me?
Can l?
Honey, I ¤uit clubbing years ago.
I have a very common face.
We have to try something new. It has to be new.
- Want some coffee?
- Wait¤ do you want coffee?
- No thanks.
- I heard a lot about you.
You reaIly have long hair and
fair skin as he kept telling me.
How about putting heat rays beneath?
Am I the only one who's cold?
It can be the follow up for the speaker table.
- It's good , right?
- What do you think?
How about making a second line of ALX
that produces standardized sizes
at a moderate price?
That way, more people could
have access to ALX world .
It could open a new door for you.
Second line of standardized sizes. . .
It's a briIliant idea!
Really?
Who the hell are you?
Everything she says is fine?
You didn't even listen to me when I pitched the
the speaker table or about the second line. . .
Damn it.
Have a seat, E-soo.
How is it?
I like it.
I heard your studio is holding a party.
Thank you for the invite,
but I don't think we can make it.
We're very secretive
and you know Woo-jin's condition. . .
And I only attend parties with hot girls.
Don't take it personally.
When is it?
I like the furniture here.
Me too.
Damn it. God damn it.
Should I just go?
I'll say I'm E-soo's grandma.
Nevermind .
I don't ask for much.
Please. . .
Let me be a man.
Why didn't you bring him?
Everyone brought their date.
He can't come?
Tonight's biggest issue was
your date.
Why is that?
Because everyone describes a different person.
They're just curious.
But. . .
You do have a man. . . Right?
I do. You'll be surprised when you see him.
Drop it.
If he's the man who leaves you alone
on a day like this,
he's useless. Find a new one tonight.
Look around .
Am I too late?
No, you're not.
How do you do?
Wow.
Nice to meet you. I work with E-soo.
Well. . . I should leave you.
Enjoy the party.
Good God, wow.
I tried really hard.
I was a grandma!
Stop staring at each other.
I feel like vomiting.
Let's go somewhere nice and have a drink.
Drop that! I warned you!
Look at you, dumbass.
Your eyes are literally sparkling.
Jesus. Stop it already.
Isn't this guy handsome? It's useless.
Because it keeps changing everytime he wakes up.
One day he's Chinese, the other day, a woman.
He once woke up as a hot girl. I almost did him.
Don't listen to him!
But I won't change.
I want to live with you.
What are you talking about?
There's no such person!
You see one right here.
Woo-jin, talk to her.
You must be drunk, Sang-beck.
Am I? Yes, you might be right.
To tell you the truth
I hate you , E-soo.
Huh?
Don't mind him. He's drunk.
Right. Didn't you order a Iove chair?
Why did you use a pseudonym?
And use your address?
You dog. . .
You and E-soo. . .
He's kidding right?
Of course he is. . .
E-soo
He's a nice guy.
Please don't hurt him.
I know you're a wonderful person.
But that's what worries me.
I'm sorry I hate you.
I am just way too drunk.
Let's me go pee first.
My bladder's about to burst.
Bladder. . . What a great word.
Shall we go?
Before he comes back?
Will you marry me?
I'll raise the children .
I raise the kids¤ you raise the money.
What's this?
Oh it's that thing!
That's it for today.
What's this?
Why are you looking at my phone?
What's wrong with you?
- You're so good, sis.
- At what?
Who are these men?
This is my mom's shop.
And she is my mom .
Oh. . . I see.
No you have to hook it through here. . .
Shall I undo it?
Let's try again. . .
- Turn it like this. . .
- Good, just like that.
Put it here. . .
Wind it. . .
I will just knit one for you .
Okay.
Welcome.
This is hard.
Woo-jin said he was a bad son.
That he doesn't visit you enough.
Are you okay
being with him?
It must be hard on you.
I don't want anything else.
I just hope you don't get hurt.
Cheers! Long time!
That's how I saw it.
How is your handsome boyfriend?
Oh, is he the one I saw in front of our store?
You saw him?
When I was working late.
He looked a bit different.
How long have you been together?
Didn't he come with Mr. Han the other time?
- Right.
- Call him to join us.
- Yeah!
- Call him now.
Incoming call!
It must be him! Tell him to come right now.
Next time, next time.
Is he with someone? Bring him too!
Where are you? I am here.
I am here, too.
Where?
Find me.
What?
I said, find me.
Stop it. Where are you?
Sorry, I thought it would be fun.
"WOO-J I N"
I've grown accustomed to her.
"I'M SORRY¤ E-SOO.
I WON'T DO IT AGAIN ."
I never thought of it in her perspective.
"WOO-J I N"
E-soo, l'm really sorry.
I didn't know it would freak you out.
"KNOCK, KNOCK."
"OPEN THE ¤OOR, PLEASE."
Don't smile.
I am still mad at you.
Then why are you here?
I should be the first one
to witness tomorrow's Kim Woo-jin
so that he won't mess with me.
- So you're sleeping over?
- I don't know!
You're so mean.
I'm really sorry. . .
Don't ever do that again.
HeIlo?
Why didn't you wake me up?
I would've taken you home.
I came back just fine.
Why are you whispering?
Eun-soo and dad are still sleeping.
So I'm in my room.
Oh. . .
HeIlo?
Breakfast, E-soo!
Dad, look at her!
She fell asleep while preparing herself for work.
E-soo, wake up!
What's with her lately?
What's with you lately?
I heard about a moron who's crazy about a girl,
and it turned out it's my best friend.
I know l'm delaying things. I am sorry.
I'm not your biggest problem .
Just call your mom sometimes.
Why do you make her call me?
You should've told me.
Was it me who's not calling?
Or was it you who's not answering?
I am sorry.
Shut up and put these in the fridge.
Your mom told me several times
to keep them in a cool place.
What the heck. . .
I made them with E-soo.
Why don't you just live together?
That's what I said. I thought the same thing.
You ugly looking shit. Stop trying to be romantic.
Find yourself a cure or something.
What should l do with you?
Marriage?
Could it be possible?
But it is the obvious choice.
There we go.
I got some cuts while making the ring.
It'll be okay tomorrow.
The cut looks really natural
as it is made of prime wood.
What wood is this?
Um. . .
What are the measurements?
I think. . .
I will. . .
Thanks.
HeIlo.
This chair is made of prime ash wood. . .
Pills. . . again?
No.
E-soo, come see me in my room.
Okay.
E-soo.
Are you ill?
I just have a digestion problem .
I haven't been sleeping properly.
I know what it is.
It's a man problem¤ isn't it?
Listen.
People are saying that
you're seeing a different man every day.
The boss asked me about it.
Of course I told him they're all lies.
But I'm still worried.
A healthy girl like you suddenly drawn-out
taking pills all the time. . . You can telI me.
It's nothing, really.
You'll be the first to know.
Can you describe your symptoms?
Where to begin. . .
It's. . .
I love a pecuIiar man.
He's changes every time he wakes up from sleep. . .
into a different person.
It sounds weird.
Can l record what you're saying?
- I forget things a lot, lately.
- Go ahead .
It's nice to be with you .
Just us two.
It was a rough day.
I wish this would last forever.
With you not changing.
Like me.
E-soo.
Yes?
Shall we get married?
I'm kidding. How's the wine?
Maybe marriage. . .
Are you mad?
No.
Is not an option for me.
Can you pull over?
Please?
There are too many things to consider.
Have you thought about them?
How I should introduce you to my family. . .
Stuff like that.
E-soo.
Whenever. . .
you Ieave me at dawn after spending the night,
I can't help but think
that I need to be with you.
How come. . .
you only think about yourself?
Even you need time to get used to yourself.
You look into the mirror
you test your vision, you measure your feet. . .
I need time, too.
It takes time for me to accept it's the same you
even if you change
every time you wake up.
How can I make everyone accept who you are
when it's hard for me?
What should l tell them?
She's right.
And that makes me more mad.
We need to think this through .
You need to give me time
to think about it.
I am really trying here.
Can you just give me more time?
It's really okay. Forget it.
Look at me, please?
I thought we were on the same page
but now I realize that
we were reading different books.
Can you. . .
recognize him?
He said he would find me.
He would hold my hand . . .
when he sees me. . .
But doctor.
When I Iook at him holding my hand,
there's a stranger. . .
smiling at me.
Then I smile back.
I need more time to get used to him .
Have you been under intense stress recently?
When he touches me,
I keep telling myself,
it's him. . . it's the man that I love. . .
but I still can't be sure.
I try to feel him with my eyes closed ,
then it feels okay.
I feel like I am going crazy, doctor.
Do you want to end it?
He wouldn't survive without me, doctor.
What if you tell him honestly how you feeI?
If you bottle this in,
the wounds of the heart
will eventually transfer to the body.
I feel dizzy.
She seems to have taken too many pills.
Just a second. Sir?
Do you know when she started . . .
Yes, I see. Thank you.
Guardian for Ms. Hong E-soo?
The psychiatrist will be here soon. Please wait.
- What are these pills?
- Risperidone.
They were in her bag.
Didn't you know she was taking them?
Since you're not sleeping well¤
let me prescribe a higher dosage.
Remember this is not a cure.
It could get worse.
I recommend you
not seeing him for some time. . .
Can you do that?
I don't understand.
Why didn't she say anything . . .
"SlDE EFFECTS OF RISPERIDONE"
I never knew. . .
What was I thinking. . .
Have l been dreaming alone. . . ?
I guess she hinted at this before. . .
I was the blind one. Blinded by this fantasy.
Mom .
Is something wrong?
It's as if
I'm with a daughter.
It's nice to have daughter time with my son.
Is the child. . . taking. . .
pills often?
Yes.
It's exactly the same.
I guess there's no solution. . .
What are you talking about?
She will be fine. . .
As long as you two aren't together.
She'll get better eventually.
What are you saying?
You are. . .
just like your father.
He, too,
changed everyday.
I loved him . . .
but people began gossiping.
They said I was promiscuous.
I tried to ignore it at first.
But one day. . .
I lost him.
It happened in a matter of seconds.
I met him that morning
but I couldn't remember his face.
And then it struck me.
I would never know if anything happened to him .
I wouldn't be able to find him
if he disappears.
It was hell for me.
I was so afraid.
Then one day,
your dad disappeared
leaving me a letter.
It's not that he disappeared.
I . . .
made him leave.
It's hard for her too.
She can't talk to anyone. She's scared.
Why didn't you tell me?
That I'm
a freak like dad?
You said dad left you . . .
Should I do the same?
You're saying that E-soo is
experiencing the same thing.
Mom .
What should l do?
Can l live without her. . . ?
I enjoyed seeing E-soo
as a different person every day.
She never criticized me for enjoying that.
I believed that
we would spend our lives together.
They say love is the answer to every problem . . .
but it also ruins everything.
See you tomorrow.
- Have a good evening.
- See you.
- Bye.
- See you!
Why didn't you call first?
I'm meeting my friends tonight.
I need to give you something today.
Why today?
Isn't this part of a pair?
Mhmm. But I wanted to make
one that fits you perfectly first.
Have a seat.
Do you Iike it?
Of course.
It's pretty isn't it?
I haven't seen snow in a while.
It's strange that it's not cold.
Shall we walk some more?
- E-soo.
- Yes?
What shall we do tomorrow?
Let's break up.
What's wrong. . .
It's the right choice. . .
Stop taking those pills.
Okay?
Go on inside. It's cold.
Woo-jin.
This is the blueprint. They want a modern style. . .
I can feel you around me.
But I can't say anything.
I'm not quite sure what to make of this. . .
Am I relieved?
What's this?
I see. . .
Men go but things remain.
Is this custom-made for you?
Seems like it.
Sis. . .
I remember everything.
Where we went, What we ate but. . .
I can't remember his face.
I can't. . .
Everything turned back to normal.
I can sleep without the pills.
I started working out and planning little things.
And sometimes. . . sometimes I ask myself
'Am I the same person as I was yesterday?'
I wake up to my own face
but my mind flutters. . . changes. . .
Maybe you weren't the only one that was changing.
"1 0 MONTHS LATER"
It's perfect for your private space.
We have single armchairs.
Take a look around.
Look at this. A blogger posted these pictures.
What do you think?
They look good.
- Aren't they?
- Sure.
Apparently they're from
Czech. From the country side.
Thank God we have the internet!
Find out who's the designer
and if he has an agent.
Let's do this.
And . . . don't we have to renew
the contract with ALX?
I'll call you back after I talk to the manager.
I'm sorry. . . It was an urgent call.
Where were we?
I'm here for the business, Sang-beck.
So you don't have to be so defensive.
The orders will be ready in a week.
Thank you. We'll arrange accordingly.
You could have just called.
Can you assign someone else for me?
How is Woo-jin doing?
Is he well?
Czech Republic. . .
That's so far. . .
- I'm home.
- Welcome.
Dad.
Hmm?
Don't you miss mom?
It's hot. . . What did you say?
I asked if you miss mom.
Why should I?
What would you want to do the most
if she were around?
Well. . .
Grow old together?
I am growing older by the second ,
but she just stays as she is.
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Morning.
You're early today.
What was I afraid of?
The gossip?
The things that we would have to endure?
I just can't endure being without you.
Are you. . .
Great song.
What the. . . Woo-jin?
How are you.
What are you saying. I'm busy.
What should l do.
I can't understand you at all.
How's mom?
She always says she is.
Lufski . . . what? What the. . .
Are you drunk? Call me when you're Korean.
E-soo. . .
I'm hanging up.
HeIlo.
Hi .
I'm here to see Kim Woo-jin.
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
There's no one here by that name.
I thought he's staying here. Are you sure?
Yes. I'm sure. Sorry.
Wait.
This is LEA furniture. Right?
Do you mind if I go inside and
take a look around your furniture?
I'm a buyer for the mamastudio
in Korea. It's a big furniture store.
Would you like some tea?
Do you work alone?
Yes. I do.
My company is interested in your work.
I came across your design in Korea and I was so drawn by it.
I could've just email you.
But I wanted to see you and talk to you.
And here I am.
Woo-jin.
I am. . .
I am fine now.
You'll be sick again.
I know.
But being without you. . .
is worse.
I'm so sorry.
Can you just. . .
Can you just be with me?
E-soo. . .
I thought about it a lot.
I want to be with you.
You keep everything to yourself. . .
You can't live alone Iike this.
I saw you change once.
When I woke up before you.
I saw it happen.
Honestly, I was scared. . .
I was scared even though
I knew that you would change.
But as time passed,
I was grateful for that day.
Because I met the real Kim Woo-jin that day.
I don't care about your looks.
I don't care if you change.
I know it's you.
I love the Kim Woo-jin inside, right here.
I am so sorry for taking so long.
Woo-jin.
Yes?
Will you marry me?
Well. . .
I remember someone once said
that you need think it through carefully.
For a long time.
You meanie!
So?
No, you do it. . .
You propose.
Go there. Pop the question .
Go ahead!
"THE BEAUTY INSlDE"
At first, I was scared. And I was mad at you.
I was afraid. . .
if our baby would be like you .
I couldn't handle it. l was too young.
I couldn't be with you . . .
I've been watching you from a distance.
I knew how you felt.
I knew it, too.
Sometimes. . .
I could feel that you were there.
I am not afraid of being hurt anymore.
But another thing scares me.
What if something happens to you
while you're drifting away from me. . .
Then we would be done without having been
together with each other.
Can you just. . .
be with me?
