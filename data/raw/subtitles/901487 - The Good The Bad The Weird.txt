Pay attfention!
Ah, yes sir.
Take this map to Kanemaru now
And bring me the promised money.
What is this, sir?
If Kanemaru wants this,
it must be something big.
Watch that mouth of yours!
If word gets out,
bandits will be hounding all over it.
Make sure word doesn't get out.
They're in the independence army, too?
Do you know Park Chang-yi?
He's in on this, too?
Yes.
All you have to do is give this map
to Kanemaru.
Chang-yi will see to the rest.
Kanemaru will be on the train to
North Manchuria with a map.
That map is very important to us.
We need it.
And why should I help you?
'Cuz there's money in it.
It depends on the amount.
What's the reward money
on Park Chang-yi's head?
Will that be enough?
Not bad.
We have no other choice
but to pay you to do this.
So don't screw up.
Yes, sir.
Remember!
You've never set eyes on that map,
understood?
Of course, sir.
Now, go.
Your job is to get on the train.
And steal the map back
from Kanemaru.
We get paid and the map back.
Everyone's happy.
Manchurian soldiers are escorting him.
Be careful.
Are you worried, sir?
Of course not.
I know what you're capable of.
You're the best in all of Manchuria.
Just Manchuria?
Best in Manchuria means best
on the continent.
Forgive me, I'm not good
with words.
Here.
Your train ticket to Gando.
Park Chang-yi…
What the hell are you doing?
Bandits don't need train tickets.
Then?
We'll stop it.

What's going on?
Who are you?
Can you speak Korean?
Do you understand Korean!
What?
Don't know any Korean, at all?
Bags!
The bags! Hurry!
Get 'em down!
Hey, you!
Get that one down, too!
Quickly!
Get the big bag!
Hurry up!
Now, the other one!
Hey, is that yours?
Hey!
I said, is that yours?
Wait!
Do you know who this is?
He's Sir Kanemaru.
President of Japanese Imperial Bank!
Kanemaru or kangaroo! Come here!
What's that?
Stop! Drop to your knees!
Get him! Get him!
You! Go get him!
Shh! Shh!
Get out!
Get out! Go!
Hurry up!

Shaoling! No!
Please let her go!
Open up!
Move!
Does it hurt?
Find the map!
Give me the rifle!
Who the hell is that?
Stop the train, now!
Byung-choon?
Yes, sir?
What do you think
is going on over there?
No clue, huh?
No, sir.
I think.
It's the fool up front
who has the map.
Man-gil!
Let's go! Hurry!
Park Chang-yi The man behind him is a
bounty hunter named Park Do-won.
Yoon Tae-goo The man behind him is a
bounty hunter named Park Do-won.
What a nuisance!
Get rid of him!
Yes, sir.
–Who was that?
–I don't know!
Isn't the guy on the bike
a friend of yours?
Yes, but not anymore.
–Did ya get anything?
–Sure did!
What?
I'll show you later.
Let's go!
Alright! Let's go!
Get moving!
What do you think it is?
Well… Not sure.
Where is it?
Maybe Manchuria…
But with the Russian writing,
could be the Maritimes Province.
Wait…
Hey!
This is a treasure map!
A treasure map?
Before Qing Dynasty's fall,
they buried a great treasure
somewhere in Manchuria.
This is the map!
No way!
It came out on the Ghost Market
once then suddenly vanished!
All the bandits came to
the Ghost Market for it.
Go find out everything you can
about that map.
Gotcha.
Leave the map.
What? You don't trust me?
It ain't that. Leave it and go.
Come on, man.
It's dangerous to be
carrying it around, fool.
And…
Exchange this for money.
Whoa!
They'll be worth quite a bit.
Be careful.
They might've trailed us here already.
No way. They wouldn't dare!
This is my turf!
Just be careful!
Okay, I got it!
Bastard.
What in the world is this?
Russia…
Border…
Treasure…
Absolutely no idea.
Who's there?
Hold on.
What should we do?
Who is it?
It's me, Byung-choon.
Byung-choon?
What the!
You freak!
Get out!
Sorry! Sorry!
Don't move!
Get out!
Shit!
What happened? Tell me!
Where's the map?
Hurry up and give it to me.
Before I do…
You must pay your dues.
Ah, right.
What do you think you're doing?
I should've known. Fine.
I'll give you what you want.
Just give me the map.
Crazy bastard!
You've got some nerve for someone
who's hired to kill!
Gone insane over money!
You worthless son of a bitch.
I took you in when you were
wandering around drunk.
I saved your sorry life!
I wanted to end this nicely,
but now you give me no choice.
No matter how notorious
of a ruthless killer you are,
you can't dodge a bullet.
A bastard who kisses the asses
of traitors…
What a pitiful end you'll…
Funny, ain't it?
People must know
they'll all die someday.
But they live as if they never will.
Damn funny.
Well, well…
You lived long enough.
Selling off your country.
We found out, sir
It's the Ghost Market thugs
and Park Do-won.
Knowing I, Park Chang-yi,
would be after it?
Yes, sir. But…
Looks like Park Do-won
was after you, sir.
The Ghost Market?
It's a market for stolen goods.
There was a gunfight last night.
The fool who stole the map ran away
to the Ghost Market.
He'll probably sell it there.
How many men can we round up?
About a dozen, sir.
Get the boys and go
to the Ghost Market!
Pack it up.
–Yes, sir.
–Yes, sir.
Come in. Cheap prices!
Good lantern, sir?
Come in and look around.
Umbrellas for sale!
Out of my way!
Umbrellas!
Granny?
You sure do live long.
You'll probably outlive me.
What happened last night?
Byung-choon came after me.
The idiot even said his name
before shooting.
Why?
For the map?
Probably.
So did you find out anything?
It's gotta be
the Qing Dynasty treasure map.
Not only the bandits
but the Japanese army's after it.
Let me see it.
There's gotta be something…
Forget it! Give it back.
Hold on! I know this!
This is the Russian Empire…
Alexand…
Sand? Desert?
Alexander.
What's that?
–Give it to me!
–I know what I'm doing!
Next word is…
'Buried'.
It says, “Buried”!
Like a buried treasure?
That's right!
Then it says…
“Excavation”!
Ex-vacation? What's that?
It means dig up.
Then…
“In large… volumes”?
Then this all means, buried, dig up,
in large volumes?
Hold on!
–Are you sellin' it?
–Nope.
You crazy?
The Ghost Market thugs are after this.
The word will get out quick.
The chief here will probably give ya
at least 1000 won.
You idiot!
This could be worth millions!
Are you out of your mind?
The reward on your head
is 300 won.
What?
I'm only worth a piano?
A used one at that.
They think I'm just a petty thief?
You, Mr Train Robber,
ARE a petty thief.
Let's just sell it at the
Ghost Market for 1000 won.
Forget it. I'm gonna see
if this is worth gold or shit.
Granny! Granny!
Know what this is?
It's a treasure map!
If we find the treasure,
it's goodbye to this for us.
We'll eat all we want
and live in luxury!
Where do you wanna go?
America?
Where else? France?
En toi, c'est dah di dah.
Je t'aime, moi non plus?
What?
Damn! Shit!
Shit! I told ya they're fast!
Where are they?
Out the window?
Get out! Hurry!
Get Granny!
Granny! Granny!
Those bastards!
Run!
Bastard!
Granny!
It's not safe here.
They went that way!
Stay right here.
Don't lose this
and don't show it to anyone.
Even if Man-gil asks,
tell him you never saw the map.
Damn!
Watch Granny!
Hey! Move!
–The Ghost Market Gang is coming!
–Get back!
Damn sons of bitches!
Yoon Tae-goo, age 35,
300 won reward.
What are you saying?
I don't speak Korean.
You're Chinese, are ya?
No! Please! Stop!
I knew it was you.
You have the map, don't you?
Who are you?
Yes or no.
Just answer the question.
You're after the map, too?
Damn bastards.
I did, but not now.
So there!
Where is it?
Use your brain, fool.
I'm in this shit 'cuz of that map.
You think I'd just go and tell ya?
The independence army wants it,
not me.
Independence army, my ass.
Think I'd fall for that?
Talking doesn't get through
to ya, does it!
Wait!
Okay! Okay!
I've got an offer for ya.
I don't make deals with scoundrels.
I'll tell you a big secret
about that map.
You know what it says?
“Treasure, Buried,
Dig up, Large volumes”.
What?
That's what it says on it!
It's a treasure map!
So you and me can go find it!
If there's a treasure,
we split it 60-40.
Me 60, you 40.
How 'bout it?
That's how you
make a deal, man!
Did ya say your name was
Park Do-won?
You must've heard of who I am.
Of course you did.
Then do you know the Ghost Market?
My boys there will…
–Hey!
–Sorry.
You crazy bastard!
You evil son of a bitch!
I've never seen a Korean
so mean and vicious!
You can't do this to me, man!
How old are ya!
You little…
Hey, Yoon Tae-goo.
Don't even think about escaping.
Give me some water.
What did you catch this time?
What's this?
Get some sleep.
You got a rough day ahead.
Get me some water, girlie.
It can talk?
Water, please.
–Song-yi!
–Coming!
But…
Going somewhere?
Escaping?
No, of course not.
I just gave it a tug
and it just fell out.
You folks
shouldn't be so careless.
Fine. Go back in and sleep.
Hey, it's raining!
Boss?
We saw Yoon Tae-goo, today.
He's the one who took the map.
Just as you wanted.
Everyone's happy, huh?
I get money.
You get the map.
And the original's safe where it is.
If this map is wrong…
or there's no treasure,
then I'll find you.
And make sure you get buried alive.
That's no way
to talk to an old pal.
Look at what they did to my place.
Man-gil, that idiot.
Where the hell is Man-gil, the fool.
Granny!
Granny?
Granny!
Granny!
Granny!
Damn! You scared me!
You slept in here all this time?
Damn Man-gil!
Told him to watch Granny…
Where's the map, Granny?
Where'd you put it?
Where is it?
No, not candy!
The big map I gave you.
The map!
Just once.
Once?
Did someone take it?
Who did you give it to?
Let go.
Man-gil?
Did he take the map?
I had to come and see you.
Do I know you?
You're alone?
Yoon Tae-goo's a friend
of yours, right?
Where is he?
And who might you be?
I'm Park Chang-yi.
Park Chang-yi?
You bastard!
Help me!
Tae-goo…
Tae-goo…
Hey!
Where do you think you're going?
–Give me another knife!
–Yes, sir.
I have a message.
A message for Tae-goo.
So stay calm.
And listen up.
Tae-goo!
Got it?
This blade's blunt!
Sharpen it!
Hurry up!
Damn rain…
What! Run!
Retreat! Retreat!
This way!
Man-gil!
Man-gil!
Stay right here, okay?
Shit!
You! Run to the other side.
So I can see
where they're shooting from.
Why should I be the one?
Then who else?
Should I run straight on?
Or zigzag around
and make 'em confused?
Fine. I'll decide.
Hey! Come here!
Follow me!
Give me a gun, man!
Hey!
Give me my gun back!
Do-won! Where're ya going?
Come back!
Give me my gun!
Where are you going?
Come on! Give me my gun!
Gun! Now! Do-won!
Gun…
Shit…
Man-gil! Man-gil!
Man-gil!
Man-gil!
Man-gil!
Man-gil!
Over here!
Watch out!
Watch out!
What the!
–Cover me!
–Get back!
Get the horses!
Are you Korean?
Yes.
Is Yoon Tae-goo in your gang?
You think we'd mix
with a schmuck like him?
Damn! That way!
When our gang gets here,
you're all dead!
Yoon Tae-goo.
Park Chang-yi.
So we meet, here.
This is awesome
but why's it so damn heavy?
I'll take this.
Where the hell is Man-gil, anyway?
Got any more?
Are they Chang-yi's gang?
Damn, they're nasty.
Why's it so quiet?
Are they planning something?
Get on! Hurry!
Go, Boss! Run!
The Ghost Market Gang is coming!
Man-gil!
Man-gil!
Man-gil!
Man-gil
Man-gil! Man-gil!
Tae-goo…
Park Chang-yi came for you.
Chang-yi? Why?
You didn't lose the map, did you?
How's the meal, boss?
There's something I was always
curious about.
I heard you once had a duel
with Yoon Tae-goo, boss.
Is it true?
Then who won, sir?
I heard many different versions.
Some say Tae-goo is the best.
Get up.
Sir?
I'll show you who's the best.
Get up.
That's not what I meant…
Get up if you don't want
your head blown off.
Listen up.
You'll all witness who's the best
And who's the legend, real soon.
Don't die till then,
and be sure to watch.
Hey, let me ask you something.
Just when I'm about to sleep?
It just popped into head, man.
Why are you so bent on
catching Chang-yi?
Ever heard of the Finger Chopper?
The Finger Chopper?
Chang-yi's the Finger Chopper?
Yup.
I heard he came to Manchuria
but no one's ever seen him.
It's Chang-yi, for sure.
There was a guy in Wonsan who claimed
he was the Finger Chopper.
When Chang-yi heard about him…
he found him and butchered him.
Just 'cuz he claimed
to be the Finger Chopper.
He shot him and cut him up
like a piece of meat.
Along with five of his men.
Even cut off his finger, too.
If you weren't in the way,
I could've gotten him.
What's so funny?
The rumors.
You say Chang-yi's the Finger Chopper
but it's different from what I know.
So you're after him
'cuz he's the Finger Chopper?
'Cuz he is bad.
That's it?
And for the money.
You scare me more than him, man.
If you have no country,
you still gotta have money.
You're the most cold-hearted Korean
I've ever met.
You'll end up rich for sure.
The map and Chang-yi's head
will get me 6000 won.
I'll hand over the map
as soon as I get Chang-yi.
Just hope he takes the bait soon.
If this really is a treasure map,
he's sure to follow you.
Even if it's to hell.
Hey, wait a minute.
This map ain't his!
He's after me 'cuz I stole a map
he wanted first?
It ain't right!
Thieves got rules?
You don't know, man.
Thieves have rules, too.
If someone's in the door before ya,
you back off.
Chang-yi's goin' against the rules!
Pisses me off…
Hey, wait!
If he's still following us
after getting beat at the market,
That means this is
a real treasure map!
Yes! That's right!
Keep following me,
Park Chang-yi!
What's so funny?
I'm happy, man!
I'll tell ya since we're
in this together.
If we find a big treasure there,
whatever it may be,
You know what I'll do with it?
Wanna hear what my dream is?
I'm going back home
and buying me some land.
I'll build a house, raise some cows,
horses, and sheep.
That's it?
And some dogs and chickens, too.
Anything else besides buying land
and raising livestock?
I never thought beyond that.
Why buy land
when your country's stolen?
For folks like us,
it's the same
living under nobility or the Japs.
Now, it's your turn.
For what?
If we find the treasure,
what do you want?
Wait, I shouldn't be chattin' away
like this.
Let's sleep.
We got a big day ahead.
How did you end up in Manchuria?
I came to live a new life.
Why Manchuria of all places?
Did you steal in Korea, too?
Don't ask, man.
It's sad.
Every Korean has a sad story.
Hey. Yoon Tae-goo.
Everyone has the right
to dream big but…
Did you know?
What?
Hurry up.
I gotta sleep.
If you chase something
to get something
Something else will come chasing you.
Life is about chasing
and being chased.
There is no escape.
Let me sleep, man.
Stop making me think!
This map…
I don't believe in it.
But if it's for real
and someone asks what my dream is…
I'd say…
You asleep?
Are we there yet?
Beyond this hill is a plain.
Then a small hill
in the middle of the plain.
Beyond that within a 30m radius
should be the marked place.
Go and check.
Yes, sir.
Hejun! Shengying!
We finally made it!
We're here!
I see it!
I see it!
I see the ocean!
The ocean?
It's the ocean.
The ocean?
What the hell!
Byung-choon.
What happened?
Damn that Man-gil!
Food and drinks, please.
Got a spare room?
Yes, right down this way.
Sir.
This used to be called
a stable house.
Where people stay and rest
with their horses.
But now…
What is this place?
Don't worry, sir.
Who are you?
You don't know me,
but I know you well, sir.
You robbed that train, didn't you?
Don't get excited, sir.
I'm Suh, a fighter for
the independence of Korea.
Crazy from too much opium?
Even opium dealers are now
into the independence movement?
Let's discuss the details
in the private room.
What's going on?
They're just the barmaids.
Don't worry, sir.
Embarrassed to say,
but opium funds the movement.
Our primary customers are
Chinese, Russian, and Japanese.
You must know how difficult
the situation is in Korea.
If you'll allow me…
Anna. My staff.
As you know,
The Japanese took over Korea
Manchuria as their puppet.
And now they're set on
taking Gando.
But Gando originally belonged to us!
This land is rightfully ours.
We owned out to here
in the past.
Whatever, Mr Independence.
My map's got nothing to do with that.
So forget it.
Not in the face, girl.
Your map is the key to the future
of Russia and Manchuria.
If it succeeds,
it'll have a huge impact on…
Hey, you!
What the heck are you
talking about?
You're not making any sense.
Stop smoking!
He's already giving me a headache!
The future of Korea,
rests on that map, sir.
Japan is trying to take over
the inland continent as we speak!
More than ever
Your map will be
a great help to Korea.
So, I ask you…
Who are we?
What are we?
If you hand over the map,
you'll be greatly rewarded.
I get it!
Mr Independence wants the map!
You won't find anything
even if you get there.
Oh! Mr Independence really wants
the map, huh?
Wait!
Didn't I already say that?
I said it twice, right?
I did, didn't I?
Right girls?
Stop smoking.
Tell 'em to stop, man.
Girls, I can't think
with all this smoke!
Damn.! He's so heavy.
It's me.
I got the map so tell Capt.
Ishihara to get the money ready.
Of course I caught him!
I told you he'd come this way.
It's the border.
Wake up, mister.
Please, wake up!
Mister?
Who are you?
You a new girl?
Where's the scumbag?
New, my ass!
Here I am, shithead!
Close your eyes, kids!
Independence fighter my ass!
He fell for it good!
Out of the way, kids!
I'll take the map.
You can go to hell!
What?
You little…
Close your eyes, kids!
I've been in countless wars.
But I've never seen
such gruesome deaths.
Damn Koreans.
Perhaps he's a pervert?
Did you find the map?
No, sir.
We lost it again.
I hear you're looking for the map.
No…
The one who has the map.
Yoon…
Tae…
Goo.
Capt. Ishihara!
It's time to make a decision!
Send all the troops
Mobilize all forces out there both
Japanese and Manchurian.
Yes, sir.
It's not just some secret facility.
It's Japars last source of funds
to finance the war.
So the rumor was true.
We must destroy it before
the Japanese get to it.
Wait, Na-yun!
We can't rush into something like this!
General!
Make you decision, sir!
There's no victory without bloodshed!
We don't have the forces
to take 'em on, now!
Give us the command, sir!
If you don't hurry,
Tae-goo and Do-won
will get there first.
I don't know what your deal
is with Tae-goo,
But stay away from him.
Never saw anyone come out
alive against him.
He'll survive no matter what.
Hey!
Your damn mouth is
always the problem.
Hold still!
What if an independence fighter
took the map?
If that's the case,
it could mean disaster for us.
Where's Do-won?
How would I know?
Just 'cuz I work in a dump like this…
This is an urgent matter!
They're headed for the Korean shelter
on the great plain, now!
The Japanese troops are
headed there, too!
Hurry! Go!
Who the hell are they?
Byung-choon?
Mom… Mom…
That way!
Fire!
It's the last resource for
our nation's prosperous future.
Capt. Ishihara!
We must find that map!
Byung-choon?
What's going on here?
Isn't that the fool
who has the map?
I think so, sir.
Blow the horn! Tell the others
to get the fool on the scooter!
Yes, sir.
By the way, sir.
What really is this map we're after?
Yoon Tae-goo!
Hey, Tae-goo!
Stop!
Or I'll shoot!
Who do we go after, sir?
He's the one with the map!
The one up front!
Get him!
Yes, sir!
All forces! Charge!
Don't kill him!
He may not have the map!
Tell the boys up front!
Catch him alive!
Blow the horn!
Who the hell is that?
Get him alive!
The Japanese army is here!
Should we open fire, sir?
Hurry up! Fire!
Wipe 'em all out!
Yes, sir!
Open fire!
The Japanese army is here!
That bastard!
What do we do now?
Shit! Forget the map!
Let's go!
Stupid son of a bitch!
Fight till the end!
Son of a bitch!
Shit!
You scared me!
Found it after all, huh?
Park Do-won!
Following me all the way here!
Where'd you go?
I missed ya.
This is the place.
It's right here.
What's this smell?
The treasure's rotting?
Dig!
Ah, sure.
I'll dig!
But why am I the only one digging?
We split it 60-40, so I dig first,
is that it?
You don't trust me, do you?
Bingo.
Not till I see it first.
Think I could ever trust you?
Think this is a joke?
Go on. Dig.
Put the gun away while you can.
Then you think you can beat me?
Are you trying to be funny?
The reward on you shot up.
Real high!
Tragedy at a happy moment like this.
Damn!
You escaped my punch, huh?
Come here you!
Put 'em up!
You're on thin ice, man.
What the hell is this?
Is it a treasure house?
Where's it coming from?
Park Chang-yi, that bastard!
The sick bastards!
What the hell is that?
I knew it.
There's no treasure here.
Know what I thought about
while coming out here?
I lost everything.
All thanks to you, two.
They died like dogs.
Died in vain.
Actually, no one dies in vain.
Only those left behind feel empty.
So I've decided…
To fill the void…
I'm gonna play a game with you, two.
A way to get rid of both of you
at once.
A fun game.
A game to decide who is the best.
Where no one knows
who will shoot whom.
Where only one man survives.
Right here, right now.
I'll kill both of you.
That'll never happen.
I'll shoot you down first.
We'll see about that.
Tempted, aren't ya?
Come out Yoon Tae-goo!
That's it? That's all?
Killing us to fill your void in life?
That's just stupid!
You moron!
Why the hell did you chase me
all the way out here for?
To find out who's the best!
You can have it!
Have the honors, I don't care!
Tell people I lost,
I don't give a damn!
If that's your reason for living,
mine's finding the treasure!
We don't see eye to eye, man.
Got that?
So, see ya.
Then how's this!
Reason enough for ya?
How's that for a start?
The survivor takes it all.
Looks good to me.
But why drag me into this?
Can't call it a real game
without Park Do-won.
Think you got the skills?
We'll see about that.
Reason enough for me.
Tae-goo's in, too.
You crazy sons of bitches.
It's 'cuz I can't stand you two.
So split it between ya.
I don't care!
I'm outta here!
Ciao!
Damn!
They're asking for it.
Still got my finger?
Finger Chopper!
Hear that?
Was it fun?
Remember?
Wonsan, five years ago.
Winter.
I never forgot that day.
Park Chang-yi.
I left everything behind
when I left Korea.
So you forget it, too.
How can I ever forget!
There's no way out of this one.
Guess you're stuck, Tae-goo.
Or should I say,
Finger Chopper.
You're diggin' your graves.
Don't regret this, boys.
Let's roll.
What the…
What the hell is that?
I came to the wrong place?
Why am I so heavy?
Never thought the past would
come back to haunt me.
Forget everything, man.
You're goin' to hell anyways.
This is for your trip there.
Coming all this way for nothing.
God damn it.
Damn Korean!
Retreat! Retreat!
Damn luck! Shit!
Dead
Wanted: Yoon Tae-goo
Reward 3500 won

You know Yoon Tae-goo, right?
Tell me where he is.
What?
Where's Yoon Tae-goo!
You bastard!
I'll ask you one last time.
Where's Yoon Tae-goo?
