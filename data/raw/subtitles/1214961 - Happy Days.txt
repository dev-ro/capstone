# Hey Chandu #
# Every day, Every minute
is very important #
# If we do something today#
# Think about the value added because of that#
# What are you thinking of achieving in life..
..and how you are going to achieve it #
# With clarity....one goal
you should have a proper plan #
# Hey!
Wake up! #
# Life...clarity....
What will I know dad #
# Why am I so tensed today.. #
# I dont understand at all #
# Fear?....Or excitement? #
# Never in my life I got up so early..
today seems new #
# Hey...mom's awake..
so early? #
# Looks like she never sleeps #
# She might have definitely made kheer #
# just like the day I wrote EAMCET..
and the day results were out...hmm..#
# Dude...wanna come to the temple?
No ma #
# That monkey also might have got up...#
# Dad....so early...another lecture? :( #
# Chandu...parker pen dude #
# My dad gave it to me....
On the FIRST day of my ENGINEERING College #
# Its yours....from now on..
take it..and Best of Luck! #
# Lecture would have been ok...
Sentiment..no no.. #
                 Tensed?
Dont worry...everyone will feel the same on the first day 
If any problem, just go to the principal
He will take care of everything
Give her his cell no.dear
   hmm..yeah
If anyone in college asks, tell them u can sing
# Hello..hello..I lose a lot of hair these days..#
Putting  some oil will be enough na...
instead of being stylish..
Not u ma...I am telling the girl in the radio
Why did u ppl have to come dad?
As if some operation is going on
How much more distance will u ppl come??
Why did mom have to put oil on my hair??
Why did u tell princi that I sing well??
This is one idiotic radio
Dad...until now, 147 cars went along this road..
 single driver cars.
That would mean....300 litres of petrol per hr
Suppose these ppl travel in buses or metros..
We might save about 10 crores of petrol per yr!

What happened?
Yo u dont want to write?
I got it
If i see its once, thats enough..
I like that boss
Heard that you are hitting on a senior on the first day itself
That was fast
Thats the way he works dear
He'll do it if he likes it
Chandu, you will need to bring him
 to college from tomorrow
Me coming to college daily is impossible
I am sorry, I just helped him..
bringing him to college daily would be diffiult
It'll  already be late when I reach home
Your house is somewhere else
Kukatpally
Hey..I'll write mine..u write yours..ok?
You are asking me why you should help?
Why is he writing notes for you?
Why did you try to stop a senior
 from hitting him just now?
This is called humanity dear
I can see that u  lack in that
Pandu come, lets go
You need not write notes for this guy
Wait..please wait..
Where do you stay in Kukatpally?
Housing board colony :)
Pandu, come
Hey Chandu
You did the right thing.
I liked it
I really like it a lot
Finished the assignment?
Give us the copies..common..
So, finally, our first day of college was over
Was a bit tough..
and a bit funny..
it somehow went by
Ma..
Ma..I need a half-saree..urgent..
Here..I got one
This one? :(
Dont know who asked you to,
but its good to see someone bending u :P
Madhu was fighting with her 8th Class half-saree
Shankar...already started preparing 
as if it were final exams
And rajesh...desperately trying to upset the fatty
And for rajesh's sake..
tyson too is in his own world.
It seems you said there was a rash..
Hey..we know these tricks..
Sorry...er..saree doesnt...
By tomorrow morning, you should 
wash them and press them
Appu understood that fooling seniors is risky
Chandu..u only supported him
I know he is like that
College radio right?
Yeaah :

Come lets go..propose your idea
No Chandu..not now
not now please..
Dont be afraid..
I'll be there na
Excuse me...We have..she has an idea
Instead of a notice board,
we can have a college radio
We can play songs, debates...
Hey..get lost from here
Chal, get up!

And this is low cost..and pretty economical
Please give me one chance
Hi

haha...was just waiting for you..
So..how was the idea?
hmm..they actually liked it
but may be next year..
this year...it seems they are building
 a hospital in the neighbouring village
Better luck next time..atleast u tried
But that half-saree guy is just killing me :(
You can wear that and come tomorrow na
He'll leave u then may be..
Hi Madhu

Will you come in my car?
Please Madhu, u can come na..
Freshies?

Thanks again Madhu
Even though I am a senior, 
U need not wear it for me na
Actually, it was not only you
Two other seniors asked me to do so..
Thats why I wore one
Oh
Why are u in such a hurry?
Dont know how to carry this half-saree
And moreover..that fellow's PITA
He's killing me
Always follows me, everywhere
Or...shall I drop u?
No, thats ok. If he sees us again,
he'll die crying
Hey Madhu
You..are looking really, really beautiful today
Is she beautiful??
yeah
Tera baap..
Chal..
Write 1000 times
"Madhu is my sister"
Only then, to the class
Madhu?...my sis?
Just shut up and write
Hey Chandu
If you are found close to Madhu again,
I'll kill you
Understood?
I am serious about her, she is mine
I am not joking
Understood?
Now write
Chandu
Whats this?

Get lost
Half-saree effect....or donno why...
That day, i just wanted to be with her
Wanted to talk to her
May be..even wanted to touch her
Lots of feelings..
When I was just wondering how to...
"Announcement for tomorrow's drawing class
Everyone should bring their own drafters..
And everyone should bring their own textbooks"
Hey Madhu
I am going to buy the drafter,

Oh thanks

Lets buy N D Bhatt too
We'll go right now, otherwise that 
half-saree guy will catch us
Ya ya right..
Hey, but its raining
Its ok, come
First time, someone other than my sis
is sitting on my bike
And that too, it was Madhu
And that too, in a half-saree
And that too, it was raining
I think this is LIFE!
Come, have tea and go
My mom is a chai specialist
Forget abot the chai
her mother
her house
and grand-mother
total family..i just loved them
Come, I'll show you my room (by Madhu)
And finally...Madhu's room..
Superb!
Donno what..but I just get the feeling that 
this girl is getting too close to me
Hey bro, shall we play carroms?
Body at one place and mind at another
May be this is what it is
Even though its so long since I came here
My mind is still hovering in Madhu's room
Dont know what the hell is going on..
Hi
Hi

And also, need to take Snoopy out for a walk
Oh..walking..
Shall I join?
You just left right..
Ya, but..generally..

Ok
Weather is good
Your dress is also good
Nice dog
Hey, whats going on?
Actually, I am feeling bored at home
thats why
But we had a good time right
Yeah
Hey Thank God
that idiot didnt catch us
Still, why is that guy so crazy?
I think he is obsessed
Just the sight of a half-saree,
I think he goes mad
He keeps irritataing me 
checking from top to bottom
May be he thinks...u r really very cute
Anna, one kg flour and 12 eggs
Am I looking so good?
Shall I tell u the truth?
You are just superb!
Seriously!
Thanks anna
