I'm pregnant.
Good.
That's real good.
¶ Hey, hey, now, now, baby ¶
¶ Let's just go
all night long ¶
¶ Well, on, on,
on, on, darlin' ¶
¶ I just want you
to go on more ¶
¶ There won't be
no tutti-frutti,
no lollipop ¶
¶ Come on, baby,
just rock, rock, rock ¶
¶ We gonna rock all night ¶
There it goes.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Yes, timing's still off
'bout two degrees.
Looked fine to me.
What you think?
I think we won.
¶ Ooh! My head ¶
That's fine right there.
Now, come on. Come on now.
Now that's a fast car
you fellas got.
And it's mighty fine of you
to let us boys race with y'all.
Whoo!
¶¶
Come on now!
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Get ready to dance
with ol' Virgil. Come on.
Damn Richard, slow down.
All right now.
Where you going?
What you think?
Like it?
Like what?
This spot, right here.
This field?
Yeah.
This field not a half a mile
from my house I've been knowing
all my life?
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, I like it.
I'm gonna put the kitchen
right back here.
Richard, stop this.
I don't know what you're saying.
I bought it.
This whole acre.
I'm gonna build you a house.
Right here.
Our house.
Mildred?
Yes?
Would you marry me?
Come.
He said he'd bought
the whole acre for me.
And then he asked
me to marry him.
No he didn't!
Yes.
Right out in the field?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, Lord that man
might be crazy.
Well, when you gonna do it?
He didn't say.
Soon, though.
Before the baby comes.
He gonna take my sister from me?
No.
We'll be right down the road.
Everything looks fine.
Thank you, Miss Lola.
We'll see you soon.
We'll be here.
Hey now.
Hey, Mama.
They out back.
How we doing?
Mmm.
Get that board and
get up under there.
See if you can't get
the collector loose.
So I'm gonna take Mildred
up to D.C. to get married.
So, you sure about that?
Yeah.
And you need a witness?
No.
I'm gonna ask her Dad
to come up there with us.
Rich is gonna take Mildred
up to D.C. to get married.
String bean?
Don't make no damn sense.
You'd be fine
living in the house.
No wife, just fine.
You don't need no wife.
Why she gonna be your girl?
Why you wanna get married?
Don't make no sense now.
You think they'll see us today?
Yeah, I called up there.
Seem like a long drive to me.
Thanks for coming, Jake.
Daddy, what's the city like?
It's fine.
Marriage is an institution
of the highest importance.
And it's made honorable
by faithful couples
who are committed
to each other for life.
Do you have the ring?
By the power vested in me
by the District of Columbia,
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.
I may not forgive him.
Come on now.
You lucky if I forgive you.
No reason to go
all the way up there
for this and not take us.
We took Daddy.
Like that means a thing.
Richard said there would be
less red tape in Washington.
That's all.
You can stop looking at it
String Bean,
you know it's purdy.
¶ For that's what love
will do ¶
¶ Darling, I'm ¶
¶ I'm so surprised ¶
¶ Oh, when I first realized ¶
¶ That you were fooling me ¶
I'm turning in.
What you think 'bout a bedroom
in the back?
I'll like it however
you make it.
¶ Darling, they say
that our love won't grow ¶
¶ But I just wanna tell them ¶
I'll be in there soon.
Mm-hmm.
¶ For as long ¶
¶ As you love me ¶
¶ Our love will... ¶
¶¶
¶ Is everything
all right, babe ¶
¶ Is everything all root ¶
¶ Is everything
all right, babe ¶
¶ Is everything all root ¶
¶ Is everything all right ¶
¶ Oh, rooty-toot ¶
¶ Then let the fun begin ¶
¶ Hope it'll never end ¶
¶ Let the fun begin ¶
¶ And hope it'll never end ¶
How about something like this?
¶ I wanna love you,
love you, baby ¶
¶ All over again ¶
¶ Is everything,
is everything, is everything ¶
¶ Is everything,
is everything all right ¶
¶ All right, baby ¶
¶ All right tonight ¶
Hey, Mama.
Sheriff's Deputy came by
looking for you.
What did he want?
Wanted to find you.
Did you tell him where I was?
I didn't have nothing
to tell him.
Applesauce good.
What you like, Rich?
Ford or Chevy?
Don't make much difference.
But which one faster?
That depend on who built it.
That's what I said.
How much money you win
with that car?
Boy, why you asking him
'bout his money?
He don't have to answer me.
How many races you won, Rich?
A lot.
You need my hand, you need my
hand too? Count on this one.
Didn't think he was gonna stop.
I wanna know, you know?
In here!
What you doing in that bed boy?
Richard!
What're you doing in bed
with that woman?
I'm his wife.
That's no good here.
Get your pants on, boy.
You get out of that bed.
Get out of that bed!
Come on.
All right.
She goes in there.
It's all right.
Come on.
It's okay.
Richard Loving?
Yeah.
You made bail.
Bean. Bean?
Richard?
Go on down.
What about her?
Just you.
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't pull me again.
Come on now.
That's not right.
Bean.
Richard?
It ain't right!
Come on.
It ain't right!
Sign at the bottom.
What about my wife?
You'll have to talk to the Judge
about that on Monday.
Monday?
All right just rest.
Rest, rest.
Richard.
Yeah?
Bring me that fresh water
and take this one out.
Bear down. Bear down.
Here Mom.
Leave that down.
Wait, wait.
What you gonna do?
How did they know
to come get us?
Somebody talked.
Hey!
Hey!
We told you to come back on
Monday and talk to the Judge.
I ain't gonna let her stay there
'til Monday. It not right.
Talk to the Judge. You're not
allowed to bail her out.
I'll get a lawyer.
You can.
Hey boy.
Come on.
Sit down.
You back here trying
to bail her out?
You know they aren't gonna
let her out to you?
You best send some of her people
up here to get her,
because they won't let her
out to you.
But sh-she pregnant.
Shut your mouth about that.
I'll throw your ass back in
there for that. You know better.
It's just not...
What's that?
You do know better don't you?
Nah, maybe you don't.
Your daddy worked
for a nigger didn't he?
Running timber?
I'm sorry for you.
Now I really am.
All you over there in
Central Point don't know
up from down.
All mixed up. Part Cherokee,
Rappahannock,
part niggra, part white.
Blood don't know
what it wants to be.
You just got born
in the wrong place, is all.
I see you got to
thinking it was fine.
You might think people around
here wouldn't care.
Hell maybe they wouldn't
if your dumb country ass
hadn't gone off and married her,
but not me. You hear me?
That's God's law.
He made a sparrow a sparrow
and a robin a robin.
They're different for a reason.
No.
No.
You go on now.
Get on home.
Send some of her people
up here on Monday to get her.
I see you try and bail her out
again I'll arrest you.
I should put you in with
her tonight.
Your daddy posted your bail.
It's all right, babe.
It's all right.
Where's Richard?
He moved his things out.
Said they'd arrest y'all again,
if they catch him here with you.
Ya'll come on.
Come on here. Come on.
Bean.
It's okay.
Now I gotcha.
You okay?
They hurt ya?
No.
I'm just scared.
They said I couldn't see you.
I know.
What we gonna do?
I got a lawyer.
And they say he's the best
in the county.
He gonna get
it all straightened out.
I don't know.
It's fine.
All we gotta do is just keep
to ourselves for a while.
And this will blow over.
Yeah?
I better go.
Better go.
We'll walk over there
in a minute,
But I met with the Judge this
morning,
and I worked out a deal I think
is pretty fair.
Judge Bazile is a friend.
But he is not a fan of your
particular situation.
If you all plead guilty
the Judge is willing to suspend
any prison time.
Well...
we'll do it.
Now, in exchange for suspending
the jail time,
you and your wife,
unless you decide to dissolve
the marriage,
will be forced to leave
the state.
Leave the state?
What does that mean?
It's exactly what it sounds
like.
You two are not allowed to be
in the state at the same time,
and certainly, aren't allowed
to be here together.
For how long?
How long will that last?
Twenty five years.
That can't be right.
Look, you got a year
in state penitentiary,
which I remind you,
could have been up to five years
at the maximum,
you got a year in prison
on one hand,
and leaving the state
on the other.
That's an easy choice.
Try not to talk unless he
directly asks you a question,
which he won't.
Just like we talked about,
he'll ask what you plead,
you say guilty, and this will
be over quick enough.
... the said
Richard Perry Loving,
being a white person,
and the said Mildred
Dolores Jeter,
being a colored person,
did unlawfully and feloniously,
go out of the state of Virginia,
for the purpose of being married
in the District of Columbia,
on June 2nd, 1958,
and afterwards returned to,
and resided in the County
of Caroline,
State of Virginia,
cohabitating
as man and wife,
against the peace and dignity
of the Commonwealth.
How do you plead?
Guilty.
Guilty.
The court does accept the plea
of guilty,
and fixed the punishment of both
accused at one year in jail.
The court does suspend
said sentence
for the period of 25 years,
upon the provision that both the
accused leave Caroline County
and the State of Virginia
at once.
And do not return together
at the same time
to said county and state
for a period of 25 years.
Do either of you have anything
to say?
No, sir.
No, sir.
You are released from custody.
Settle your court costs with
court.
Thank you, Your Honor.
It's 36 dollars
and 29 cents apiece.
That's a number
in Washington for Nancy's
brother Alex.
His wife Laura's there
most days.
If you need to get us,
just call.
Okay.
Daddy?
You okay?
You knew what you was doing
taking her up there!
You had no right for that!
Bean?
How you all doing?
We're fine.
Thank you for taking us.
We've got plenty of room.
You remember Richard?
Yes.
Thank you.
No. Glad to have you.
Come on in.
Let me show you the house.
Okay.
I'll be back by dinner.
If the vehicle goes aloft
at too steep an angle,
its velocity is cut
by 800 feet a second.
Working more directly against
gravity than planned.
Reaching over 23,000 miles
an hour,
it carries to nearly
80,000 miles.
30 times as far
as ever before.
Another moon shot is...
What can I do?
Nothing.
Bean.
It's just...
I always thought
your mother would be the
one to deliver the baby.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, Mama.
Put some wood in the stove.
Thank you for doing this.
Oh, yeah.
All right, String Bean,
it's on you now.
Yes, it is.
Drink this.
Rich!
Rich!
Her water broke.
Okay.
Take a breath. Take a breath.
Breathe.
Okay. Bear down.
Bear down hard.
Thank you, Mama.
You never should have married
that girl.
Well, I thought you liked her.
I like a lot of people.
That doesn't mean you should
have gone and done what you did.
You knew better.
Sidney.
Hi, Sidney.
Sidney.
Call the lawyer.
Tell that woman
to come out here.
She ain't here.
She left.
Boy, I will split your head
into white meat,
and go arrest every soul
in that house.
I won't ask you again.
No.
You're in luck.
The judge is in today.
You'll go straight there.
For violation of your parole,
you're ordered
to post a $200 bond,
and appear before this court...
In the next...
Yes, Frank?
We ask for leniency.
I incorrectly told the Lovings
it was fine for them to return
home for the birth
of their child.
It, uh... It was my mistake.
Your Honor, I think...
Fine.
Thank you.
Don't come back here again.
You do and you go to prison.
This doesn't happen
a second time.

Sidney, Donald, come on down!
Hey!
Okay.
Okay.
Come on in.
You go.
Hi, pretty girl.
Your cousin Gerald and Davis
are fine,
and Sue and Terry
send their love.
They just had a little girl too.
Really?
Their second.
Hmm.
Sidney, don't jump in the house!
They're big.
Yes.
I hate it for them.
It's like they're caged.
Not even any grass
for them to run in.
And Daddy?
He's fine. Stays up in that
chair more than in the field.
I told Mama, if he doesn't
start getting some work done,
Mr. Banks liable to find
someone else for it.
Clay said he had this...
Good. What are you doing?
Where is that piece?
How was your sister?
I need one piece.
She's fine.
One, two, three, four,

I almost has it.
Yeah? You wanna show me?
The long-awaited
march for jobs and freedom
on Washington, D.C. has
started and it is about
half of the 100,000 estimated
crowd headed off down
Constitution Avenue,
headed toward the Lincoln
Memorial, which is where
we are seated now. It is here
that things have climaxed...
You boys stop that wrestling.
Come and help Miss Laura
with her groceries.
... coming in around this plaza
surrounding Lincoln Memorial.
They say over
100,000 people there.
... who is standing by
along the parade route
at 17th and Constitution.
Can you imagine?
Might as well be
halfway around the world.
What?
Nothing.
However, some 15 minutes ago,
the march...
You know what
you need to do?
What?
You need to write
Bobby Kennedy.
I'm serious.
I mean, that's what
they up there for.
All this talk
of civil rights.
You need to get you
some civil rights.
... engaged
in demonstrations before.
In the background,
you can hear some of
the young people shouting.
Freedom now! Freedom now!
Freedom now!
"Freedom... Freedom now."
Freedom now! Freedom now!
Freedom now...
Mm.
They in bed?
Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry I missed 'em.
They ask for me?
Peggy did,
but she went down fine.
Will you get Saturday off?
I hope so.
Sidney, get up and spread
those sheets for me.
My turn, my turn, my turn!
My turn!
Don, make sure
your sister gets a turn.
My turn, my turn, my turn.
Byrd residence.
Hello. I'm calling
to speak to Mildred Loving.
This is she.
Hello, Mrs. Loving.
My name is Bernard Cohen.
I'm the lawyer
that was referred to you
by the ACLU.
Are you familiar?
I'm sorry. No.
You wrote a letter
to Attorney General Kennedy.
Is that right?
Yes.
He was not able to help you
with your particular case
and sent your letter
to the American
Civil Liberties Union.
The ACLU contacted me.
I'm a lawyer in Virginia,
and we would like to help
with your case.
I see.
Mama! Mama!
Don, baby, hush.
Would it be possible
for you and your husband
to meet with me?
I would have to check
with my husband.
Okay.
I'm based in Alexandria,
but I have an office in D.C.,
if that is a concern.
Well, as I said in my letter,
we really can't afford a lawyer.
No, ma'am.
The ACLU will take care
of any fees.
Mrs. Loving, are you there?
Yes, we'll see you.
Wonderful.
I'll have my secretary
call you back to set up a time.
Nice speaking with you,
Mrs. Loving.
Come here, baby.
I got a call
from a lawyer today.
A lawyer?
Mm-hmm.
From the American
Civil Liberties Union.
Robert Kennedy
told 'em to call us.
Go help your sister
brush her teeth.
They wanna help
with our case.
Well, we can't
afford a lawyer.
He said they
wouldn't charge us.
We're going to go to see him
on Thursday.
His name is Cohen.
Hello.
I'm Bernard Cohen.
I'm in from Richmond.
I talked to Jim
about using his office
for a few hours.
Yes, Mr. Cohen.
Do you know it?
Down the hall?
Yes.
My clients
are Mr. and Mrs. Loving.
Could you send them down
when they arrive?
Certainly.
Come in.
Mrs. Loving.
Hello.
Please, have a seat.
Bernard Cohen.
It's a pleasure.
Thank you
for coming in today.
So, as we discussed
on the phone,
the ACLU would like
to take on your case.
I was actually a charter member
of the ACLU in Virginia,
which is why
they assigned me to you.
The bottom line is,
we wanna get
you all some relief.
That's very generous.
Thank you.
Now, the first step
is to appeal the sentence
in Caroline County.
That will be our fastest route
to federal court.
The problem...
Federal court?
Yes, the goal is to try
to get the federal court
to hear the case...
Excuse me.
I don't understand.
Federal court?
I see it
as the best route to...
Can't you just go and speak
to Judge Bazile?
We ain't hurting anybody.
I don't think that...
Well, just talk to him.
Just talk to him.
You should tell him if...
if he let us back in the state,
well, we won't bother anybody.
Look, I do not think
that this case
will be resolved
in Judge Bazile's court,
or probably any other court
in the state of Virginia.
I believe this is a court battle
that could go all the way
to the Supreme Court.
We're listening.
Our problem is that in order
to appeal the judgment
of conviction,
we would have needed
to do so within 60 days.
Now, given that
it's been five years
since that conviction,
we have to find a way
to get it back into the courts.
- Are you following?
- Mm-hmm.
Now, I've given this
some thought,
and I have
a somewhat unorthodox idea
on how to do this.
My suggestion would be
for the two of you
to return to Caroline County,
get rearrested,
and then we will have
an avenue for our appeal.
You want us
to get arrested again?
Yes. It's an idea.
I, of course, will be there
to bail you out.
We aren't gonna do that.
Right.
I can see how
that was a mistake.
I understand.
Look, I need to do
some more thinking
on this first issue,
but bottom line is,
we are gonna get you all
some help.
We appreciate you.
We really do.
Yeah.
If it gets us home,
we'll take their help.
Well, you get
what you pay for.
Get off the street!
Hey, Lee, give him a hand!
Better control that concrete!
I got it!
Hey!
Look out!
Donald!
Mama! Mama!
- Mildred!
- Up here.
What's going on?
Donald got hit
by a car today.
What?
He's fine.
Just scraped and bruised,
is all.
Hey, you okay?
We're moving back
to the country.
I don't care
what they do to us.
I won't raise
my family here.
All right.
Y'all get loaded up now.
Come on.
Thank you, Alex.
Peggy, Don...
Thank you, Ms. Laura.
Mm.
You just go on.
I'll see you tonight.
- Y'all be good.
- Okay, Daddy.
Bye.
Daddy!
My cousin has a house
he might rent out.
But I thought Jim's brother
said it was fine here.
I don't trust 'em.
And too many people.
Where is it?
King and Queen County.
Just a farmhouse up there.
I figure it gets you
out the county
but keeps you close.
You'd be on your own out there.
It don't have no phone
or nothing.
But no one's gonna find you
unless they know where to look.
I can get word to you
when you need it.
How much you think
he'd want for it?
Ah, he'll be fair.
Peggy!
Hey.
I'll try to get home
before dark.
Mm-hmm.
Mm?
We'll be fine.
"We haven't heard
anything from you for so long
we had given up hope."
Martha, call Chet Antieau's
office at Georgetown Law
and try to set a meeting.
Yes, Mr. Cohen.
Come in.
I'd never seen anything
like it, you know?
Excuse me.
No matter how many times I get
down South, there's always
something that surprises me.
Oh, yes.
Please bring him back.
This is good timing.
I want you to meet
a former student of mine.
He called about a case
you may find interesting.
Uh, yeah.
Sure. What's it about?
Well, we only spoke
briefly on the phone.
But in essence...
Ah.
Hello, Professor.
Thanks for seeing me.
My pleasure. You've come
at a good time, Bernie.
This is Phil Hirschkop.
He's a brilliant
civil rights lawyer.
Nice to meet you.
So, what's the problem?
Well, I'm a bit stumped.
The ACLU referred me
to this case concerning
an interracial couple
that was married in D.C.
They were arrested
for living together in Virginia,
and the judge suspended
their sentence under order
that they leave the state
for 25 years.
I filed a motion to vacate
the judgment with Judge Bazile,
the original trial judge
in Caroline County,
but he's stonewalling me.
Of course,
the ACLU sees this...
and I agree...
as a potential contender
to repeal the anti-miscegenation
laws nationwide.
I just need to get
the ball rolling,
as it were.
It's a very
delicate situation,
because by appealing,
you open up the possibility
of sending them both to prison.
I think regardless,
file the 1983 motion
explaining your complaint.
It'll force Bazile's hand
and get you in front of
a federal three-judge panel.
All right, look,
I got to catch a plane
to New York tonight,
but I'll work up a draft,
and I'll find you on Monday?
Great. That's just great.
Thank you.
Yeah. And, Bernie,
if you don't mind me asking,
how much experience do you have
with the constitutional law?
Some.
Very little.
You realize this case
could alter the Constitution
of the United States?
I do.
I'll call you on Monday.
One, two, three!
I'm a good dog!
I can never
get mine to rise.
It's not you.
It's the humidity.
Just thick.
Come look, Meme.
Come look.
Peggy.
She's fine.
What you want
from your Meme?
Lilly won't share her tea.
Ooh. She must be upset.
Well, she wants
to sit with us out here.
Mama, get Peggy inside!
Bean!
Hey. What is it?
Well, I got a message for you.
What?
Well, lawyer called.
Said he wanna meet
with y'all.
Sidney! Donald!
Raymond, why you driving
so fast like that?
What you mean?
I always drive like that.
- What?
- Richard...
What is it?
It's okay.
"Almighty God created
the races white, black,
yellow, Malay, and red,
"and he placed them
on separate continents.
"And but for the interference
with his arrangement
"there would be no cause
for such marriages.
"The fact that he separated
the races shows
"that he did not intend
for the races to mix."
I know it sounds strange,
but this is really wonderful.
By issuing this ruling,
Judge Bazile has really
given us a road map
right to the Supreme Court.
I'm sorry. I'm confused.
He ruled against us again.
That's right, but now
we're allowed to appeal
that ruling to the state.
From there, if the state
rules against you,
we'll have a chance
at the Supreme Court.
That sounds wonderful.
I have one little piece
of housekeeping.
LIFE magazine contacted us
about sending a photographer
out to you all.
Keeping the possibility
of the Supreme Court in mind,
I think it's a fair idea
that we raise the profile
of your case.
But I, of course,
want to make sure that you
are all comfortable with that.
It'll be fine.
Hello.
Grey Villet, LIFE magazine.
Pleasure.
What you got there,
a small-block?
Yeah.
Yeah. What's the trouble?
Carburetors.
Oh.
Well, then you're
a better mechanic than me.
If you re-jet them,
it goes faster, though, right?
I'm sure
you already know that.
Is your, uh, wife inside?
Uh-huh.
Huh?
Oh. Hello.
Grey Villet, LIFE magazine.
May I?
Of course. Come on in.
Oh. Something smells good
in there.
So, uh, I can't go back
without a photo.
No photo, no job.
And this is LIFE magazine,
and the pigeon guy
isn't around.
"Pigeon guy"?
That's right.
I'm looking up
at this office building,
and it hits me.
Right.
I go 55 stories up,
and I talk some office girls
into letting me
look out the window.
Before they could do anything,
I throw open the window,
sit on the ledge,
and dangle my feet out.
They start screaming,
but I got this great shot
of my feet flying over 42nd
and 5th Avenue.
Yeah. So, what happened?
Security threw me out
headfirst.
But LIFE magazine hired me
the next day.
That is... That's a story,
all right.
Yeah, that's a story, all right.
You go to the Virginia state
court next, right?
Yes.
You nervous?
I suppose.
Mm.
The lawyers told us
not to expect much.
You think you'll lose?
Well, yes.
But I think it's all right.
We may lose the small battles
but win the big war.
Roast beef, coleslaw.
Uh-huh. Yeah.
And here's the surprise.
Some of my new
homemade pickles.
That certainly is
a wonderful surprise.
Look at that, Barney.
Aunt Bee's brought us
some of her homemade pickles.
I see.
Sure is wonderful.
You really shouldn't
have, Aunt Bee.
That's right, Aunt Bee.
You go to way yonder too
much trouble to please us.
It's no trouble at all.
There's plenty.
I made eight quarts.
Eight quarts?
Oh, Aunt Bee
made eight quarts.
Eight quarts.
You can have some
every day.
Oh, well, I had
an awful big breakfast.
I just stuffed myself
something...
It's just a pickle.
Here you are.
And here you are.
Mr. Loving. Mr. Loving.
Just... They just wanna ask you
a few questions.
Uh, all right.
Mrs. Loving... You rolling?
Mrs. Loving,
the Virginia Supreme Court
just ruled against you.
How do you feel about
what happened here today?
Well, I feel hopeful.
I'm hopeful.
And where will
you go now?
Well, I guess we'll
go back to Washington.
You'll... You'll
go back to Washington?
Mr. Loving, do you have anything
to say about what went on
in the court today?
No, I don't have
anything to say.
Okay. Well, thank you,
folks, very much.
Did you get that?
I think so.
All right.
Cut, Donnie.
Mr. and Mrs. Loving.
We wanted you to know that,
with all this travel back
and forth from Virginia,
you have my number,
and if anybody arrests you,
you have them
get in touch with us.
We're not gonna let you spend
one minute longer in jail
than it takes us to get down
there to get you out, okay?
Okay.
Good luck to you.
You did a good job today.
Well, I sure appreciate
what y'all doin'.
Okay. All right.
We'll see you soon.
Bye.
Thank you, gentlemen.
You know they aren't
going back to Washington.
And there's no guarantee
we can get them out
if they get arrested again.
Mm-hmm.
Sidney!
Sidney!
I want you to go next door
to the neighbor.
You're gonna ask him
to use the telephone,
and you're gonna call Raymond,
ask him to bring his gun.
All right? Go.
Go on now.
Run through the wood.
Go on.
Everything okay?
It's fine.
Richard?
Go on inside.
That truck may have
just been going fishing.
Could be.
You ever hear from anyone
at your work about it?
Not to my face.
Well, I'll tell you
this, Rich,
nobody gonna tell you
what you can't do.
You're all set.
Thank you.
Who we gonna call, Mama?
I don't want you
calling anybody.
How'd that go?
Doctor said she'll be fine.
Just put her on aspirin.
Who's that?
Telephone man.
Richard had him
install a phone.
Mama, you feel okay?
Yes.
You got some tea I can drink?
All right.
Mm-hmm.
Testing. Testing.
Testing.
What do you think
you would do if you, uh...
if you lose the case?
Well,
if we lose,
then we would have to
go back to Washington.
And how does
that make you feel,
having to go back
to Washington?
Well...
Mildred?
Come here.
Excuse me.
Mm-hmm.
I don't want
those people here.
I'm done with
all these cameras.
Well, I think it's important.
These people want to help us,
Richard.
Well, actually, although
I'm sure the publicity
isn't very pleasant,
if it works out for you,
it'll work out
for a lot of other people too.
Yes. I hope so.
It's a principle.
It's a law
I don't think is right.
And if... if we do win,
we will be helping
a lot of people.
Mm-hmm.
And I knew...
I know we have some enemies,
but we have some friends too.
So it really don't
make a difference
about my enemies.
Push in hard on that one,
and you'll be straight down
the way, okay?
I got it. I got it.
Don't worry about it.
Hey. Good ride.
Make sure you get it into second
as quick as you can.
You got it.
All right.
The car looks good.
Yeah, it's running all right.
¶¶
I'm sitting in the backseat...
Oh, man.
I miss you, Rich.
Hell, I can say it.
Hey, Percy,
don't you miss Rich?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I miss you, too, Virgil.
Man, so... so, what's all this
you got going?
All what?
What you got.
See, you just went
and made it hard now.
No... You think I'm crazy,
but you know what hard is now,
don't you?
Yeah.
Richard, you white.
Now, you may think
you're like a black man,
but you're white.
You hang around
all these black folks,
but when you go to work,
you're still white.
But not now.
Now you know what
it feels like now, don't you?
You black now,
ain't ya?
You a damn fool.
All right. Come on now.
Mm. No, he need to hear it.
Look, every nigga in here
wish they were you, Rich.
And you ain't got
sense enough for it.
You got a fix.
I ain't got no fix.
See, your one is easy.
All you gotta do is divorce her.
Divorce her?
All you gotta do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
I'm gonna divorce her.
That's all you gotta do, right?
That's all you gotta do.
Mm.

Come to bed, Richard.
We've been talking to lawyers
for near ten years now.
Let's go to bed.
I can take care of you.
I know that.
I can take care of you.
I know.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's very good.
Mm.
Well, I have some
really terrific news.
The Supreme Court has agreed
to hear our case.
Now, of course,
the state of Virginia
will mount their defense,
but we are feeling very good
about our chances here.
You've got the full weight
of the ACLU behind this.
It's a miracle.
What's their defense?
I'm sorry?
Virginia.
How they gonna defend
what they done to us?
I guess we won't know
until the hearing,
but it's likely that
they'll use a defense
similar to something
they've used before.
What's that?
It's your kids.
Our kids?
The state of Virginia
will argue that it is unfair
to bring children of mixed race
into the world.
They believe the children
are bastards.
Now, as the defendants
in this trial,
you are allowed to come
and hear the arguments.
No. We don't need
to do that.
It's a tremendous honor
to sit with the Supreme Court.
Very few people...
No.
It's fine.
Excuse me.
Mildred?
I won't go without him.
You know, Richard,
it's, of course,
up to you not to attend,
but you should know
the Supreme Court only hears
one out of every 400 cases.
It's historic.
Thank you, Mr. Cohen.
Well, is there anything
you'd like me to say to them?
And by "them,"
I mean the Supreme Court
justices of the United States.
Yeah.
You can tell the judge...
You tell the judge
I love my wife.
You okay to park?
Thanks, Martha.
Number 395.
Richard Perry Loving,
Et Al., Appellants,
versus Virginia.
Mr. Hirschkop.
Mr. Chief Justice,
associate justices,
may it please the court?
You have before you today
what we consider the most odious
of the segregation laws
and the slavery laws.
And our view of this law...
and we hope to clearly show...
Okay!
... is that this
is a slavery law.
We ask that the court consider
the full spectrum of these laws
and not just the criminality,
because it's more
than criminality
that's at point here.
It's the right to inherit land,
the legitimacy of children,
and many, many rights.
Mr. Cohen.
Mr. Chief Justice,
may it please the court?
What is the danger
to the state of Virginia
of interracial marriage?
What is the state
of danger to the people
of interracial marriage?
Marriage
is a fundamental right.
Pass me that.
Hello?
Mrs. Loving?
Yes?
It's Bernard Cohen.
Oh, hello, Mr. Cohen.
I'm calling with great news.
What's that?
... back in our favor.
Yes, I'm here.
That's wonderful news.
Yes, I understand.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Cohen.
Mr. Loving... Mr. Loving!
Mr. Loving, how does it feel
to have the Supreme...
Mr. Loving, have you heard
from the attorney general?
Mrs. Loving, what does
this mean to your family?
Do you plan to
return to Virginia?
Have you heard
from the attorney general?
Several Southern states
have already announced...
Take that to your daddy.
Whoa.
Wanna help me?
Mm-hmm.
You wanna brush the wall?
