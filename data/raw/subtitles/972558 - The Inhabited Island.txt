Year 2157
The mankind's World of Noon
Armed with the Great
Theory of Upbringing
mankind forgot about
wars, hunger and terrorism
The nature had been revived
Breakthrough in medicine
saved people from illnesses
allowing to use hidden
resources of human body
Earthlings are
developing faraway planets
New generations rose for
whom search in deep space
is a routine matter
Young earthlings are
brave, strong and naive
They think they
can do anything.
Maxim, where are you? Maxim?
Hi, granny..
I want to ask you..
do you plan to
drop the university?
Four years of education
down the drain.
Why should I drop it?!
I'll return in two days.
How many times your have
been saying "in a two days"?!
I think you forgot
yourself in playing
How old are you now
- twenty or twelve?!
In twelve years old
people do not in the business
of doing the Free Search
And by twenty they
do not do it already
It's not a work for serious
man. Examinations are near..
You'll fail it! Mother got jitters.
Father got jitters.
Did you phone the father?
I will.
You will.
By the way, Lee from Shanghai
phoned you three times.
You confused girl's
mind and dashed.
Granny, will
your ever lay off?
Well then, firstly,
if you please
phone the father. He is nervous because
your are not preparing for the exams.
secondly, how many times
did your grandfather
ask you not to
touch his belongings.
You didn't took his
watch, didn't you?
I didn't.
You didn't?!
And, at last, thirdly:
What a bore.

For what reason?
I wouldn't give you.
Good morning,
Your Excellency..
We have a new data on Nomad..
Massarakhsh..
In the morning..
Nothing special,
Your Excellency.
Nomad had took..
from the Information
department..
the savage
whom we had captured lately.
at the southern border..
Is it a savage?
And why do he need the savage?
But.. it is evident..
Say what..
Gather all
information about him..
What is it? Where
did he come from?
Yes. I am listening..
Hello, papa.
Yes..
Sure, papa.
So what.. is it a contact?
Ah?
Oh yes, it's a contact.
And I thought they
forgot about me.
Do you have many
outsiders here?
Aliens from up there.
Maybe don't have a
time to look into them?
Do not, please.
Massarakhsh..
What a massarakhsh..
Stop, stop, stop..
Go.. Go.. Turn back..

I had no time.. traffic jams..
Can't do anything..
You know how it goes..
You hadn't do a thing.
You had just needed
to call a driver!
I am guilty.
I'll catch him.
He can't go far. He have an
outstanding appearance. It is..
It's a work for..
about two or three days..
If you'll lost him again..
I will..
fire you.
The people are telling
what they have to sell-
bread, spices etc
Do you want me?
Don't I look like unhappy and humiliated,
like the one who lost freedom?
Didn't my eyes close
from a sorrow and terror?
Say me..
Do you?
But there will be the
one from outside world..
who will return
freedom to a poor.
It's reeks somehow
badly in here.
Strange, I haven't
feel anything.
It reeks.. It reeks
by some mouldy stuff.
So, help..
Looks like the
walls are rotted.
All is rotted.
Nomad, where had
you been last week?
It was an academic mission..
It was a material collection..
Mmm..
Was it an academic mission?!
You are, surely,
the right man.
But draw the line..
All right..
We do have one mission..
It's untidy, but rapid.
Blister
Ehh.. Blister..
Aren't you a boss of the
Department of Public... Health..
The eyes and ears of..
Unknown Fathers
The armour and the
pole axe of the nation..
How many people did you bring

And you have found it..
A-

It's a shame
Blister
You blurt it out
You are blabbermouth

He is the brother.
What a strange sky.
Maybe there are..
dots in the sky
that light and shine.
How do you call them?
Lanterns.
It's not it.
Stay away.
Please.
All right, I am back..
I'll be in city
for a long time.
You are so slim.
Mah..
It's Gai.
My brother.
Guardsman
See, he was transferred here.
Gai.
He is Mak.
He is..
Are you familiar, aren't you?
What is going on?
Shit.
It's a foul material..
Won't do at all..
- Nomad
- Yes..
You said it's a two-three
days. So where is he?
I rouse my people in a
police, he have no documents..
Report an all people without
documents to me personally..
He don't have a
chance to escape.
What's this?
It is a psycho-panorama.
It's an entertainment strip.
They are recording
ravings of some madmans.
And then showing it.
Where do they do it?
At a TV centre.
Possibly.
They turn off lights again.
Provocation at Pondej border..
Today in 5 AM..
a frontier duty
detail was fire at..
when they patrol..
northern-most border of our..
country.
Four soldiers
were wounded, and..
one of them, corporal
Roshe Musait..
seriously injured.
Mobile brigade Otpor came
to the place of incident..
Under the direction of
the brigadier Kolus Helsh..
In accordance to the Justifiable
Vengeance in Peacetime law..
there were raid to a
frontier territory of Hon.
20 enemy soldiers and a weapon
facility had been destroyed.
Aggressors learned
severe lesson..
and our border guards...
Mak.
Mak..
What's wrong?
Sit down.
This is the World Sphere..
Yes it is.
It's rigid.
Yes it is.
And this is the World's Light
and it's one in the universe..
Yes it is.
And you are living
inside a bubble..
With heads up to it's centre?
I think so.
Rada.
You've got it all wrong.
It's opposite.
Look, this is a planet..
This is a star..
where it is rotating around..
And in the universe a lot of..
stars
You are living not on the
inner surface of sphere..
but on the outer.
You can flight here..
And you can flight
out from here.
Possibly..
Have you understood?
No, I haven't..
Mak..
Have a look around..
The horizon arks up..
It's an optical illusion..
Do you as well think
that I am crazy?
No
You do..
- You do..
- No!
Mak..
Please, say me what's
going on with you?
I will understand, honestly.
It's nothing.
Just that was not the contact.
I was considered
as.. funny madman..
I was tested..
The ship destroyed..
And without the ship
no one will find me.
And I won't get out of here.
And I lost..
.. everything.
You know, it's
impossible to lose all.
You know, I am aware..
when mama..
my and Gai's papa
was a doctor..
And once he find himself in a
plague contaminated vicinity..
In the plagued vicinity..
And everyone was
evacuated, but he remained.
He said that he won't leave
because he is a doctor, you know.
And after that, because there
were no time to cure plague,
they just dropped a bomb.
Who was it?
Don't know.
We didn't yield, Mak.
We have survived.
I have always knew that
all going to be all right.
It's true.
And then you came.
Your Excellency, I have a dispatch
on that savage whom Nomad have lost.
Yes?
All efforts to find
him were failed.
It seems the savage
died in the city.
What a pity!
What a pity that I couldn't see Nomad's
face when it was reported to him.
Thank you.
Dismiss an action.
For a three years I was
serve at the south border.
There were radioactive jungle,
and a people turned to mutants.
Just a walking joints of meat.
That only know how
to eat and shoot.
Mak, our country
is in the circle..
There is a island empire
at the oversea archipelago..
It's said that they
worser than degenerates..
But worser than degenerates..
there are no one.
Why?
Yeah, you saw it yourself.
That tower installation..
When I was a child, I already
worked hard on construction site.
We all worked hard to build
protection system. And the towers..
And the towers
stopped the war, Mak.
That is Unknown Fathers stopped war
with the towers, when they come to power.
If they'll be
absent Hot and Pade..
will bombard us
in two minutes..
and a mutants will
come and eat remains.
And degenerates.. they are
destroying towers for a money..
For a dirty Hon's papers.
They are corrupt scum..
And who are those
Unknown Fathers?
They taken us from a pitfall..
They muster willpower
to curtail that..
extremist scumbags who..
jump anything conveniently
portable after the empire fall
and thought that the
country was their belonging.
But why are they anonymous?
Because they are
official at the service.
They aren't ruling, Mak.
Thy are working.
Do you know how difficult it
is, when always risk of a war.
There are always bombs
under apartment houses,
kindergartens and
eventually under the towers.
Gai..
That's why I
enlisted to the guard.
It wasn't a
factory or a field.
It was the battle guard.
We are responsible
for all now.
For anyone..
For them..
I don't like small-talk
and scribbles, corporal.
Either you recommend Maxim...
or not recommend.
Yes, recommend, sir!
So how can I understand
this two papers?
Here
I am recommending Maxim for approval to
private candidate for the battle guards.
And here..
It is necessary to carefully check
Mak-sim's background. Massarakhsh..
So what do yo need
eventually, corporal.
Mr. captain I believe he
is suitable for the guard.
He is like a brother to me.
But I don't know his past.
He has no documents at all.
And he don't remember anything.
I am ineligible to hide it.
Two thirds of our
territory wallow in anarchy.
There are starvation
and epidemic.
People running
away from there.
And no one have documents.
The department of Public
Health let him through!
- But the depar..
- But me no buts..
We are in the guard.
And not at a
philosophical faculty.
Either you recommend..
or not, choose one.
You did well!
The guardsman is to
trust the friend..
entirely.
Don't worry.
I am myself..
look after him.
They are saying some random
patriotic guard's motto.
After me..
At the double..
Go on.
Go after me..
Unit, take aim.
Advance for two figures.
Unit
Fire
Advance for three..
three figures.
Unit
Advance for three figures.
Fire
Don't ever do this again
Everyone make a mistakes.
I am your officer, you here
to obey, not to correct.
An what if you are wrong?
Listen to me..
For the benefit of discipline
don't try to be knowledgeable.
What is specific
demographic pressure?
It's a measure of aggression.
What is SDP at the
border with Hon state.
116 standard units.
It means that there is
always war readiness.
What about mouth
of Blue Snake?
115 with inaccuracy of 0.4
Gai, you lose an argument.
He memorized the
book in half an hour.
Wait a sec.
I don't know why..
Why what..
Why do Hon and
Pandei hate you so?
Because before the war..
We were single nation..
Because they are
our former provinces.
And they hate us just
because they and us..
have the same history.
They want desert
similar to southern here.
Gai, you lose an argument.
And dress yourself, please.
What is cereals harvest..
in north-west regions?
They don't cultivate cereals
in north-west regions.
It's over, Gai.
Go under the table and sing.
Gai, stop it already.
Go under the table.
You are big bloke.
Gai!
Here yo go, breadwinner..
You can feed you
family with bare hands.
You can't eat it,
it's too polluted.
We mustn't fish here at all.
But we still
fished with father.
It was long ago..
Take it.
There were somehow
different in the past.
Maybe the world were kinder.
A people were smiling.
Like you..
And we have clean rivers
We have a seas and lakes.
This color I like the most.
My mom told me similar story
about magic mountain country Zarta.
It's sort of happy country.
There are only kind people.
Maybe you are from
that magic country.
In fact, I am from Moscow.
But no one believe me here.
Are you feel homesick?
I do.
But above all
my poor parents..
It had been told
to them that I died.
But wait..
Maybe you will make this..
yours..
null-transferrer with a..
spira
-.. you know what I mean.
Well.
Because we are..
Ready to checkout.
Don't move from
your positions.
Attention, first unit
- follow me.
First triplet after
me. Rest will stay here.
Don't allow anyone
out, take them alive.
Come here.
Where are you going?
Forward!
