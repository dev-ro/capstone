Does that hurt!
lt is unbelievable
how much pain a thing
like this can cause.
Have you ever had a corn?
-No, I have never had a corn.
Regent Diek, I
know that it's hot
today and people are
a bit out of sorts,
but there is no reason to be mad at me
just because I have a corn on my foot.
l am not mad at you because
you have a corn on your foot.
l am mad because I have
something important to say.
And I haven't been able to get
it out because of your foot.
l'm either hearing about it
or you're limping around on it.
Will you please sit down?
Oh, you're right.
That's better, yes.
l have a message from
the board of regents.
Good. The board of regents.
How is the board these days?
Disappointed.
Disappointed? -Disappointed.
Disappoint...
About what? -Plenty.
They feel that your problems here
at the school are overwhelming.
Well, so do l. -And
the board wants action.
New blood, fresh ideas.
Top-level changes, Higgins. That's what
the board wants. And, frankly, I agree.
Oh, good thinking, Diek. Yes.
Fresh faces, new blood,
top-level changes.
That's the ticket.
Good. Good to hear that you
agree. When are you leaving?
Oh, iust as soon as l... What?
When am l...? Well, you didn't
mean... top-level changes?
Yes, Higgins. Top-level.
Well, not the very
tippy-tippy top?
Surely not the very
tippy-tippy-tippy top?
Yes, l'm afraid the very
tippy-tippy-tippy top.
Let's face it, Higgins,
you've had years
to get this place back
on its financial feet.
And you haven't done
it. Waste. Waste. Waste.
Here, look at this budget.
Well, the costs for the science
department alone. They're ridiculous.
The science... That's
that Quigley again.
l know what... l'll fire him.
That'll end the waste.
Oh, I guarantee that.
Quigley out, waste
out. You'll see. Oh...
l'm afraid firing Quigley is not
going to satisfy the board of regents.
Now, Higgins, Iet's not
make a problem out of this.
Why don't you just
step down gracefully?
Step down? I can't step down.
You see, l'm right
in the middle of my...
uh, my promotional program.
Promotional program?
-Yes. To raise money.
That's what you want, money?
-Yes, money. But how...?
How? Don't you worry about...
All I need is 30 days.
Higgins, honestly, I don't...
-30 days, Regent Diek.
All right, 30 days. But that's
it. No more excuses this time.
l don't know what l'm going
to tell the board of regents.
Regent Diek, you'll
find your confidence
in me is amply rewarded.
What confidence? -What con...
ln 30 days the
changes you'll find...
Higgins, l've already told
you, you have your 30 days.
But do something. Let's get some order
restored around this place above all.
And no more
expensive nonsense!
Regent Diek, there is no nonsense
going on around here, I can assure you,
because if there were I would see it
- nothing escapes my eye.
Higgins, what are you doing? -What
am I doing? You forgot something.
Forgot something? -Yes, you
forgot your... oh, your hat.
Yes.
Wait a minute.
This is not my hat.
As a matter offact, I
wasn't even wearing a hat.
That's right. That's my hat.
l thought I recogni2ed that.
Oh, and tell the board
of regents to cheer up.
Every cloud has
a silver lining.
Doesn't it?
Type something.
A little higher on
your side. That's it.
Leave it right
where it is. Perfect.
Hey, Dexter, what do you think of
that? -Yeah, that's terrific, Schuyler.
Yeah, it does look
pretty good, doesn't it?
You know, l'm not sure a cow
mice as starved as Ruthy-Bell
would have anything
to do with this stuff.
lt's probably that acid
taste she doesn't like.
You get rid of that and
she'll probably like it.
Yeah, maybe you're
right. -Carry on.
Good morning, Dean.
-All right, where is he?
Hey, Dean, what
happened to your foot?
Never mind my
foot. Where is he?
Who? -Who? Quigley,
who. That's who.
Isn't he here? -He'll
be a few minutes late.
He just dropped by the supply room
to pick up a few more test tubes.
You mean that he
leaves you people alone?
Sure. Why not? -Yeah,
we're on the honor system.
l suppose that is on
the honor system too.
A cow on the honor system? Hey,
that's pretty good, Dean Higgins.
Stop trying to butter me
up. I know that isn't funny.
Dean, is there
anything we can do?
No, there isn't anything
you can do for me.
l just came up here to make a
little announcement. Back to work.
A little announcement? Hey, maybe
he's going to give Quigley a promotion.
Yeah, wouldn't
that be something!
lf it isn't asking too much,
do you think I would be going beyond
my prerogatives as dean of this college
to ask you what you're doing?
Oh, no, sir.
Well, what are you doing?
- l'm crushing vitamins.
l can see that. Any fool
can see that. What for?
Oh, for the cow, sir. Everything
we do around here is for the cow.
You mean to tell me
that you're crushing up
perfectly good vitamins
to feed to a cow?
Yes, sir. That's how we're gonna
cure Ruthy-Bell's nutritional problem.
Who? -Ruthy-Bell.
The cow.
As you can see,
she's sort of skinny
and hopefully we'll
end up with a fat cow.
So that's what all this expense
is for, to make a cow fat.
Not only fat, sir,
but a strong cow too.
Thrilling, isn't it?
- l'm overwhelmed.
l knew you would be. You
see, it was really my idea.
I thought so. -The kids
are just helping me out.
lf you'll excuse me...
Shorty, I need another piece of pizza.
The flavor's not quite right yet.
One piece of pizza coming up.
Pizza? -Yeah, and she
seems to like it, too.
Do you think maybe
she's Italian?
That's not funny,
Schuyler. -Don't you get it?
l mean, an Italian cow eating
pizza. An Italian cow! That kills me!
Engaging in a bit of
merriment, Dean Higgins?
He is. l'm not.
l see. Well, it's
nice of you to come by.
May I show you around? -No,
you may not show me around.
l've already been shown enough
with this vitamin-grinding numbskull
that calls himself a science major.
I heard that, sir. -Good!
That's not all I
have to say, Quigley.
Do you have any idea how much
this operation is costing you?
Well, not really, sir, but we're
cutting back everywhere we can.
You take the cow rental,
for instance. -Cow rental?
Do you mean we're paying
money to make a cow fat?
Well, you don't want us to
have skinny cows, do you, sir?
Skinny cows, fat cows
- who cares?
Dean Higgins, please don't get excited.
- l'm not excited.
Just tell me how much rental we're
paying for this so-called cow.
Well, not very much, sir.
How much? -Would $15
a day be too much?
$15 a day?
That's the extravagance.
lf the board of regents ever finds
out about this, Quigley, you're...
Yes, sir? l'm what?
You're...
What's the matter,
sir? l'm what?
You're...
Boy, he sure is having trouble
getting out that announcement.
You're fired.
Fired? -Fired?
Yes, fired.
Well, what about
his promotion?
Promotion? Quigley,
you're out of here!
Out, out, out, out, out!
And another thing! You kids
better stop thinking about fat cows
and think about some way to
make money for this school.
Because if you don't,
in 30 days l'm out,
and if l'm out, you're out.
You're all out,
l'll see to that.
What's the matter with him?
He acts like he's gone crazy.
I think I can explain it.
The school has got some
large financial problems.
ln fact, it may be going under
and the board of regents has been
giving Dean Higgins a lot of pressure.
But what's he going
to do without you?
I think the school will get along
fine without me. But thank you.
l'll tell you what, why
don't you all go back
and clear away your things
and I guess we'll
call it a day.
Yeah, hello. -Hello.
This Dexter Riley? -Yeah,
this is Dexter Riley.
Well, this is Silas Willoughby, the
man who rented Ruthy-Bell to you.
Yeah, how are you,
Ruthy-Bell? How you doing?
This isn't Ruthy-Bell.
Ruthy-Bell's a cow.
Now. what t wanna know is
what you fellas did to her.
Yeah. well. somebody
did something to her.
She's already given us 80 gallons
of milk and still going strong.
What do you think of that?
Come on, Brutus.
Go home, Blossom.
That big dog picking
on Brutus again? -Yeah.
Schuyler, you're just gonna have
to teach that dog not to be chicken.
Yeah, Brutus, you're cute.
But one of these days you're
gonna have to stand up and fight.
Can I have some of your
cereal? -Sure. Help yourself.
Thanks. Boy, it's sure gonna be
tough. -Tough? What do you mean?
Quigley having to leave
the school. -Oh, yeah.
Things aren't gonna be the same
without him, I can tell you that.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
worry about it.
l mean, after all, how many
times has Higgins fired Quigley?
l mean, I can remember him
being fired at least five times
and l've only been here
six and a half years.
l think. Or is it seven?
Schuyler, I don't think l
want any more of your cereal.
That's OK.
Coming, Dexter? -Yeah,
l'll be right there.
Come on, Schuyler. You're
gonna miss psychology.
No, l'm not. l'm not
gonna miss it at all.
l'm gonna fix my car.
Your cereal, are you sure
you're through with it?
Yeah, l'm through with it. Give
it to Brutus. He'll eat anything.
Oh, yeah. Hey, Brutus!
Come on, Brutus!
Breakfast! Brutus!
Late again. -What did
you do with my blue socks?
I think I got a rock in my shoe.
- l'll hold your books.
Dexter, how'd you
do that? -Dexter.
Slam-dunk it!
Slam-dunk it!
Hey, Dexter, you're
going the wrong way.
No, l'm not. Come on!
Really, Elmer, I hate to
have to keep haranguing you,
but all of this eating in
class, it simply has to stop.
l can't help it, Dean Higgins. l
get hungry every once in a while.
Every once in a while? Do you
reali2e that I have reports
from your first, your third, your
fourth and your seventh classes?
They are all complaining
about your eating.
Really, all of this
bag rattling and cracker
crunching while people
are trying to study.
Yes, Mercedes. What is it?
Professor Quigley's here to
pick up his severance check.
Professor Quigley. Well,
you inform Professor Quigley
that we don't give out
severance checks anymore.
But we always give
out severance checks.
Well, we don't anymore!
We just ran out of money.
Money, money, money, money.
That's all some people
think about, money.
What do you want? Where was l?
You were talking about my bag
rattling and cracker crunching.
Oh, yes, and that is
not the half of it.
l've got complaints here
from our janitorial service.
They're reporting large cake
crumbs in rooms 306 and 308.
Now, this is very
serious business, Elmer.
Teachers I can get, students
I can get, but janitors, oh...
So consider this a
final warning, Elmer.
l don't care what you do out of
class, but in class no more jellybeans,
no more cake, no more
cookies, no more...
Elmer? Elmer, am I
getting through to you?
Dean Higgins, guess what?
-Guess what? Guess nothing!
How dare you burst into my office
when l'm reprimanding a student.
Oh, l'm sorry. We
didn't mean to interrupt,
but something
happened to Dexter.
Something happened to Dexter.
Something is always happening to him.
That's nothing new. Besides,
that's no excuse to come...
Quigley, what are you doing here?
- l'm afraid I don't know, sir.
Listen, Dexter got strong.
l mean, really strong.
Professor Quigley, your ideas
on that formula really worked.
Are you talking about the
formula you used on the cow?
Yeah.
All right, you kids. All
right! Out, out, out, out!
Hey, Dean Higgins. Look!
Good heavens. -Oh, and that's
just with his right hand.
Show him what you can
do with your left, Dex.
You see what I mean?
Hey, let me down, will you?
Yes, for heaven's sakes, Iet him
down before he breaks something.
How did all this
happen with the...?
l don't know. I just
ate some of Schuyler's
cereal and all of a
sudden I got strong.
Let me see that cereal.
lt's the same cereal I eat every
morning. I never get strong.
Well, of course not. It's not
the cereal that made him strong.
lt was Professor
Quigley's and my formula.
Plain old cereal
wouldn't do anything like
that, no matter what
those companies say.
l know.
What's the matter, Dean?
-Oh, nothing. Nothing.
Would you young people mind waiting
outside for a moment? You too, Elmer.
There we go,
everybody. I wanna talk
to Professor Quigley
alone for a moment.
You mean he's
still working here?
Well, of course he's
still working here.
Everybody out. There we go. Bye-bye.
Ha-ha. Aren't they wonderful?
Quigley, do you reali2e
what we have here?
Well, it seems as
though we might have
quite an amazing
scientific development.
lt's more than that, Quigley.
It is much more than that.
Do you realize what these
cereal companies would give
to have a strength formula
like this in their cereal?
No, I never really
thought about it.
Well, you think about it,
Quigley. You think about it.
Why, we've got something here that will
get this school out of hock forever.
Much-needed new
buildings, a new lab,
money for all kinds of scientific
experiments, and besides...
Besides, if something doesn't
happen around here pretty soon,
you'll be out of a job. -That's
right... That's not the point.
Mercedes, would you
get me the president
of the Crumply
Crunch cereal company,
Coyote Corners, Curran
County, Connecticut?
That's Crumply Crunch?
Crumply Crunch.
See, under normal
conditions I can hardly
move that at all. Why
don't you try that?
Oh, I see what you mean.
Gentlemen, I think that it's
time that we get started.
Well, what do you think, Harry?
-Obviously a charlatan. A dime a do2en.
Strength demonstration? Can you imagine
the boss falling for a thing like this?
Over the hill. Should step down, let a
younger person run things around here.
Now, gentlemen,
as all of you know,
the chairman of the
board hasn't arrived yet.
However, I would like
to welcome Dean Higgins
and ask him to be patient
with us for a few minutes.
That's quite all right. My
time is your time, gentlemen.
Yes... Unfortunately,
our time is not yours.
Now, it is approximately
mo minutes past one.
l humbly suggest
that you demonstrate
whatever it is you're
going to demonstrate
so that we can get on with the
real business of the meeting.
But we can't start
without the chairman.
As senior vice president and second in
command, we can start whenever I say.
Any objections, gentlemen?
Trying to start without me again,
Harry? -Who, me? Of course not.
l could never do a think like that,
Aunt Harriet. I mean, Aunt Crumpling.
Mrs. Crumpling. -Aunt
Harriet will be fine.
But, remember, just because you're a
relative doesn't mean I can't fire you.
Any of you.
At ease, gentlemen.
Now, will the secretary please tell us
what's the first thing on the agenda?
Yes, Aunt Harriet.
That's Dean Higgins.
He's the one who claims to
have that strength formula.
Oh, yes. I believe I spoke
on the telephone to you.
You're that funny little man from
that funny little school downstate.
Uh, yes, I guess I am.
And you're here to demonstrate
your strength formula for us.
If I recollect correctly,
and I always do. -Oh, yes.
Madam, that is
precisely why I am here.
Really, Dean Higgins. -Hm?
Oh, this is my old gym outFit.
We weren't so fussy in those days.
How... how cute.
Very cute. -Oh, thank you.
May I proceed? -Certainly.
My, doesn't that cereal
have a lovely crackle?
Ves.
Oh, oh, excuse me. That was a
little throwback I didn't expect.
Now, with your permission, l'd like
to start with some weightlifting.
l'm going to show you how
easy weightlifting can be.
Bravo!
Bravo!
He is truly remarkable. Oh!
Oh, my!
That was exciting!
And that's not all, gentlemen!
More!
Oh, no, Dean Higgins! No! No!
Please, Dean Higgins. That's
quite enough, thank you.
Sorry, I got a
little carried away.
l didn't realize how
potent that formula was.
I hope I didn't upset anything.
-Oh, no. You didn't upset... a thing.
Did he, gentlemen?
-Oh, no, not at all.
Be seated. Now, tell
me, Dean Higgins,
how long does the
strength stay with you?
Well, to tell you the
truth, we don't exactly know.
That depends on the person and
the amount of the formula used,
but the duration of the
strength is definitely limited.
That's bad. -But, Aunt
Harriet, all the better.
lf a person were to
lose his strength,
he'd have to eat more
cereal to regain it.
Just think what that would do.
Why, we could sell cereal
morning, noon and night.
Now, that's good. Oh, brilliant,
Cousin Edward, brilliant.
Now, gentlemen, I want you
to pay strict attention.
The time has come
to talk turkey.
To say nothing of cereal.
Say nothing...
Sit down, Roscoe.
-Sorry, Aunt Harriet.
Gentlemen, after years
of playing second fiddle
to the Krinkle
Krunch cereal company,
we are now going
to be number one.
We're number one!
We're number one!
We are number one!
We are number one!
We are number... -Gentlemen,
gentlemen, please.
Dean Higgins, do you have a
weightlifting team at Medfield?
Well, no. See, we
don't exactly have
the personnel to go in
for that sort of thing.
Good. Stanley, put
the phone together...
and then get me Kerwood Krinkle of
the Krinkle Krunch cereal company.
Krinkle? Aunt Harriet, what are
you doing talking to Krinkle?
Just you wait and see.
A weightlifting contest
bemeen State and Medfield?
But we were national
champions last year.
l mean, State, that is.
You know, I went there.
Oh, I believe everyone
knows that, Kerwood.
But really, Harriet, what
is the point of all this?
l am proposing, in
the interest of sports,
and the cereal business, of course.
that a much-publici2ed match be
held bemeen State and Medfield
in which your company
will support State
and my company will
support Medfield.
That way the
public can determine
which is the number one
weightlifting team in America
and perhaps the number
one cereal company.
But, Harriet, we are the number one
cereal company already, remember?
Oh, I know that. And I understand
if you don't want to put
your number one
position in ieopardy.
Nonsense. Krinkle Krunch is
always ready for competition.
Besides, what a
great publicity idea.
You know, Harriet, sometimes l
think you're a wonder, just a wonder.
Goodbye, Harriet.
Medfield versus State. What a
laugh. We'll murder 'em. Right, men?
Right!
Right.
Aunt Harriet. -Yes,
Uncle Frederick?
Don't you think we should remind
Dean Higgins of one little problem?
Problem? What problem?
Spies. -Spies?
He means industrial
spies, Dean Higgins.
There is no length to which
the Krinkle Krunch company
would not go to
learn our plans.
Well, I can assure you that
this project will be top secret.
l'll see that the lab is
placed under maximum security.
You won't have to
worry about any spies.
That's fine. Of course, we do
have a few spies of our own,
but the ones from Krinkle
Krunch are everywhere.
lt's iust that we
don't know who they are.
This is me. -This is me.
Good. Were you followed?
-I don't think so.
What is it, Harry? -You're
in trouble, Krinkle.
Trouble? -Yes. That
weightlifting match. Withdraw.
Withdraw? You're
kidding. State has the
greatest weightlifting
team in the country.
We'll wipe Medfield right off the
map. -She's sandbagging you, Krinkle.
Sandbagging me? -Yes.
That Medfield bunch have come
up with a strength formula
they're putting in
Aunt Harriet's cereal
that will literally
knock your number one out.
l'm telling you, withdraw.
-I can't withdraw.
l just had a press conference.
l announced the whole thing.
ln fact, I even
bragged a little.
Then you're going to
be number mo, Krinkle.
l saw a demonstration of
how that formula works,
and, believe me, Medfield
is going to murder State.
Medfield's not going to murder State.
Krinkle Krunch will never be number mo.
Look, Harry, l'm counting
on you to get that formula.
It's worth $1 OO, OOO to me.
-It's worth a lot more than that.
All right, 150.
-150 is OK for me.
But this is a big
iob. l'll need help.
All right. Another
50 for the help, but
for heaven's sakes
get some good people.
Don't you worry about
a thing, Mr. Krinkle.
l think I have the right party
in mind. Exactly the right party.
Well, goodbye, Pete.
Always a pleasure to
visit you, just so
it's not for too long.
Well, Mr. Arno, you come anytime. And
just consider, our house is your house.
That's very good.
Thanks a lot. Come on.
What does he mean, their house
is our house? It ain't my house.
I never wanna go back
to that joint again.
He's just putting
you on, stupid.
Besides, we won't have to go back there
again if you don't louse up anymore.
Now come one.
Boss, why do you
always blame me every
time we get into
predicaments like this?
Because it's your stupidity that gets
us into these predicaments, that's why.
Hey, it's Harry! That's nice
- a reception committee.
Hey! Harry, you old son of a
gun. How's life treating you?
Couldn't be better. Chauffeured
limousine. Penthouse downtown.
First cabin all
the way. As I said,
things couldn't be
better. How about you?
As you can see, l've had a temporary
setback, but don't let that worry you.
l'll be right back on top before
you know it. -I know you will.
As a matter of fact,
that's why l'm here.
Oh? What's up?
Is he OK?
Who, him? Sure. A little
stupid, but he's OK.
You gonna start that
kind of talk again?
l mean, you keep that up, you're
gonna cause me to lose my confidence.
Oh, yeah? Hey, what's
the caper, Harry?
l'll tell you all about
it on the way to town.
Get in.
But boss, I don't care
what that guy Harry says.
Every time we get mixed up with
them Medfield kids we end up in jail.
l don't wanna go
to iail no more.
l don't go for that "Our house
is your house" stuff anymore.
Cookie, nobody's
going to iail.
lt's a real simple job that we're
getting paid a lot of money for.
All we have to do is find out where
the formula is and go in and get it.
You say that's
simple? -Well, sure.
As a matter of fact, it's so simple
l'm gonna let you handle it yourself.
Yeah? All by myself?
All by yourself. It's a
chance to prove yourself.
You'll figure it out, you'll do
the leading, l'll do the following.
You really mean that, boss?
I mean, I do the leading
and you do the following?
That's what I said.
l like that.
l lead. He follows.
Terrific.
All right. Now,
here's the plan.
When that truck leaves, we go
round the back of the building,
up on the roof, over
onto the scaffolding
and down the front
of the lab window.
The formula is in there. -I
don't like the scaffold business.
But, boss, I cased this
joint this afternoon.
The halls are loaded
with security guards.
And it's the window or nothing.
We gotta use the scaffold.
All right, but I
still don't like it.
Here, wear these. -What for?
For the ropes. For the ropes of
the scaffold. What are you, stupid?
Who's stupid? I don't like
taking orders from you.
But, boss, don't you remember?
You said to me "Hey, you
lead and l'll follow." Quote.
Yeah, and that's the stupidest
thing I ever did in my life.
OK. Follow me.
Come on, come on.
Hey, it's windier up here
than it is down there.
Yeah, that's because it's higher
up here than it is down there.
I know that. -Come
on, boss. Come on.
All right, l'm
coming, l'm coming.
Come on, come on.
Wait a minute, wait a
minute. -Come here, will you?
Put your foot on this.
Like this. OK, easy now.
l'm coming. Wait
a minute. -OK.
Right down. Just
jump. -Wait a minute.
Perfect, perfect.
Just perfect.
l'm gonna die! l'm gonna die!
l'm gonna die! -Boss, let
go ofthe wall, will you?
I can't let go! -Boss,
let go ofthe wall.
You're all fro2e up.
-Let go of my arm!
You know, you're violent.
-And you're an idiot.
What are you trying
to do, kill me?
All you had to do
was let go ofthe wall.
That's all. The whole
thing was lopsided.
l'll say this whole thing's lopsided.
l'm getting up there. I wanna get off.
Boss, you don't wanna get off
now. The worst part's over.
The rest is a cinch,
l'm tellin' you.
Look, all we gotta do
is work these ropes.
We go down nice and
easy right to the window.
Come on, get the rope.
-This I gotta see.
You're sure you know how
to work those ropes right?
Sure l'm sure. I
worked it out today
all by myself with a
phony window-washing job.
Now with you helping me,
it should be a snap here.
All we gotta do is release it
together, a notch at a time,
and we go down nice
and slow. -Yeah.
Ready? Oh, OK,
boss. Lower away.
You see, boss? -Yeah. Yeah,
this works pretty good.
Yeah, this does work
pretty good. -Sure it does.
l told you, I had
it all worked out.
You know, boss, you got all
choked up and fro2e over nothing.
That ain't good for your
heart. And another thing.
You gotta learn to trust other
people to figure things out sometimes.
Oh, yeah. Trust other people? Like
who? -People like me, for example.
Cookie! Get me up!
-Give me your arm, boss.
Give me your arm.
-Get me up, you idiot!
I can't get up! -Hold my arm.
l don't blame you for
being scared, boss.
For a minute, I
thought you was a goner.
You idiot! -It was the
rope. It got a knot in it.
You got a knot in your head.
Just stay there, boss. No problem.
- l'm not staying anywhere.
All I gotta do is release
the rope, that's all.
Oh, boy. Hang on,
boss. I got it.
Cookie! Cookie! What are
you doing, you crazy nut?
Take it easy, will
you? -I got you.
You got me, you got me.
Oh, that smarts. You
did that on purpose.
Boss! Here we are, right at the
window, just like I said. Look.
We iust gotta go in here.
Going back, we take
the stairs. -You can't.
The halls are loaded
with those security guys.
l'll take my chances
with those security guys.
l'm not going back on
that scaffold with you.
But boss, I know how
to work the ropes now.
l don't wanna hear any
more about those ropes.
Let's get that formula
and be quick about it.
All right, no problem. It
should be right over here.
The kid was working
at this desk today.
Let's see here.
Probably put it in one
of these drawers here.
That's funny. -Funny?
What's funny about it?
You drag me up here in
the middle ofthe night
and almost get me killed
on that stupid scaffold
and all you can say
is "That's funny"?
Boss, it's gotta be
around here someplace.
l mean, I could swear the kid put it
in one ofthese drawers. l'm tellin' ya.
Wait a second. I was
washing that window there.
l look through, I see the kid
working around here. It's funny.
Will you quit saying funny
and find that formula?
l'll find it,
boss. l'll find it.
Yeah, you better. It's
worth 50,000 bucks.
Now start looking.
Shh. -What?
What was that?
Sounds like somebody
snoring. -Don't be ridiculous.
Hey. Maybe they got this joint bugged.
You know how those security guys are.
They're probably picking up
everything we say right now.
That's it. We'd better get outta
here, in a hurry, but quietly.
Boss, wait a second.
You can't go out there.
The place is loaded
with security guards.
Cookie, l'm taking over
now. We do it my way.
l'm not following you anymore.
You're following me. Understand?
Whatever you say, boss.
That's more like it. Come on.
Close call, huh?
-Shut up. Over here.
Cookie, do something, stupid!
Listen, boss, I got it.
Hurry up! Hurry up!
l'll handle the rope
this time. -But, boss...
Aw, shut up.
Aah-ooh-ooh-ooh.
The window!
Well, you mo really botched things
up. I suppose you read this paper?
Of course we read it.
Everyone in town read it.
lncluding Mr. Krinkle,
and he's furious.
Well, looks like we gotta go back
there. -What do you mean? Go back?
We can't do that. Those security
guards'll be around there like crazy.
l don't care what you
do, but get that formula.
How are we gonna do that unless
we...? -Now, wait a minute.
There's only one way I know of to get
that formula. That's out of the head
of the head of the kid who owns
it. -But, boss, I know that kid.
He couldn't remember
all that stuff if he
had the formula right
in front of his face.
Well, l'm not so
sure about that.
Let's pick him up.
l know a certain
Chinese gentleman who
can be a great help
in a case like this.
Brutus!
Here, boy!
Brutus?
Brutus?
Hey, kid, you looking
for a dog? -I sure am.
Mr. Arno. Well, gee, thanks
a lot. Where did you find him?
He was wandering around a few
blocks down so we picked him up.
His address was on his collar. We were
just taking him there when we saw you.
You looked like you were
looking for a dog, so we stopped.
That sure was nice of you.
You know, I don't care what
anybody says about you, Mr. Arno.
Anyone who's that thoughtFul about
dogs sure is a friend of mine.
Oh, think nothing about
it, kid. -Thanks again.
That's OK. Good
night. -Good night.
Get outta here, you mutt!
Come on, you mutt!
Get outta here!
Schuyler was so worried
about Brutus being lost.
Really? You would have known he'd
be home before Schuyler would.
Oh, Officer Hurley, this is Dean
Higgins. I wanna report a kidnapping.
A kidnapping.
lt's Richard Schuyler, that boy
genius from Medfield College.
How do you know he's kidnapped?
-How do I know he's kidnapped?
Because he's been out looking for his
dog for three hours, that's how I know.
Well, Dean Higgins, a boy looking for
his dog for three hours is not unusual.
lt is when you consider
that the dog has
been back for mo
hours and 45 minutes.
l'm sorry, Dean
Higgins, but the
department can't get
all ruffled over this.
I do have a suggestion to
make, though. -What's that?
Well, if the dog was lost and was able
to find his way home in 15 minutes,
why don't you send the
dog out to find the boy
and don't bother the
department about it? How's that?
l don't like it and I don't like your
attitude. Let me speak to the chief.
l'm sorry, the chief is not available.
He is out addressing a Chinese dinner.
A Chinese dinner? You mean with all
of these vicious kidnappings going on,
the chief of police of this
city is at a Chinese restaurant,
stuffing his face
with rice and noodles?
Yes.
Thank you, thank you.
l'm sure I don't need
to tell you gentlemen
that I didn't come
down here to Chinatown
just to stuff my face
full of rice and noodles.
Rice and nood...
fclears throat)
ln any event, they were very
tasty. My compliments to the chef.
No, I have more important
things to do than that.
l'm down here, gentlemen, to talk to
you on behalf of our police department.
Honest, you gotta believe me.
l don't know where the formula is and
I don't know what's in the formula.
Boss, I hate to do this,
but I gotta get rough with this kid.
Five minutes, I can find
out, boss. It always works.
Honorable sir, I
admire your enthusiasm.
But this boy can never tell
you what is in the formula
because he thinks
he doesn't know.
How do you know? -I know.
You see, stupid? He knows.
Now will you shut up?
ln order to find truth, l
must put boy in deep sleep.
Then he will tell
us all he knows.
Boss, this guy's gotta
be kidding. Come on.
Be patient.
You will see, my son.
My son?
Where does he get off
calling me his son?
Maybe he likes you.
-I don't like him.
He gives me one of
those complexions,
like maybe l'm not as
smart as he is or something.
He does, huh? I wonder why.
Now what's he gonna do?
With your permission, what
you Americans call "brainwash."
Brainwash?
I don't go for this hocus-pocus
stuff. -Neither do l.
Why don't we just go back
to the old-fashioned method
and belt the kid around
and get the information?
Will you be quiet? l'm
paying Fong to do this.
Now, we'll put boy in hypnotic
trance, cause deep sleep,
make patient feel very happy.
Very happy's OK, but
what's with that needle?
Must use acupuncture, fashionable
today among modern Chinese.
Mallet, please.
This won't hurt much, son.
See? Patient happy.
You are very tired, my son.
Your eyes are heavy.
You will sleep.
You will be happy.
And you will go into
a deep, deep sleep.
When I snap my fingers, you will open
your eyes and answer my questions,
though you will
still be asleep.
Hey, will you look at that.
Remember, we are your friends.
You shall tell us
everything you know.
Everything, right
from the beginning.
Right from the beginning.
Oh, yes.
Mary had a little lamb whose
fleece was white as snow...
What?
Not quite that far back.
Tell us about the formula.
Do you remember what you put
into your strength formula?
Oh, yes, I do remember what
I put in my strength formula.
Proceed, please.
Unit consistency:
600 decigrams thymine.
700 centigrams
calcium pantothenate.
900 milligrams niacin.
Not so fast. -450
centigrams pyridoxine.
500 milligrams pyridoxamine.
What did he say? What did
he say? -That must be all.
There's got to
be more than that.
We shall see. Another
needle, please.
For the life of me, I cannot understand
what has happened to that boy.
Frankly, Dean Higgins, l
find it all very mystifying.
That could be him
now. -I hope so.
Dean Higgins here.
-Harriet Crumply here.
Oh, Aunt Harriet. How are you?
Absolutely miserable.
What seems to be bothering
you, Aunt Harriet?
l don't know.
Maybe it's just woman's intuition,
but I have the strangest feeling.
t can't µin it down.
Dean Higgins, is everything
going along all right?
Everything is wonderful
here. It's fine.
l mean, wouldn't I have
called you if it weren't?
Oh, good. l'm glad to
have your reassurances.
You know, everything I
have is tied up in this.
lf we were to lose, I
don't know what l'd do.
No. Frankly, my future
wouldn't look too bright either.
Well. good. t'm glad there's
nothing to worry about. then.
Good night, Dean Higgins.
-Good night, Aunt Harriet.
Is there anything
else, my son?
And one piece of pizza.
Must admit, very unusual
ingredient for medical formula.
However, ways of Western
people I not quite understand.
lt sounds crazy to me too.
Well, what else can you
expect from this dopey kid?
He's come up with a formula
that's just screwy enough to work.
Come on, let's get
this over to Harry.
That Krinkle cereal
guy's waiting for it.
Wait a second, boss.
We gotta take care of the
kid here. He can identify us.
Young man will be unable
to identify anyone.
He will remember only what
I tell him to remember,
will do only what
I tell him to do.
Good. I trust you, Fong. See that
he gets home as soon as possible.
And make sure he doesn't
remember anything.
Just give Cookie and me a minute
to get outta here. Come on.
My son, you will awake
when I clap my hands.
When you do, you
will remember nothing.
You will not remember where you have
been, nor what has happened to you.
All you will know is that your little
dog is home and he is looking for you.
He needs you. You must
hurry to him. He is lonesome.
You must get home
as fast as you can.
Take the first means of
transportation you see.
Thank you. Thank
you, gentlemen.
l'll be very happy to come
down again anytime at all,
but right now l'm afraid
it's getting a little late.
l've gotta be along
back to my office.
There are many pressing
duties waiting for me there,
so just at the moment
l'll say good night,
all, or better than
that... saronola.
Is that Chinese?
How about iust one
more picture, chief,
with the official committee
and your men, of course?
Why not? Why not? All right,
men. Over here. Chop-chop.
Picture time. Eccles,
Winwood. All right, Belter.
Oh, Hoppins, Hoppins.
I think I left my
gloves inside on the
table ofthe restaurant.
Would you be kind enough
to get them for me?
There we are. And
now, any friend of the
friendly sons of St.
Patr... uh, Confucius...
Isn't that right? Here we go,
gentlemen. There we are, now.
Excuse me, I have to go home
to my dog. He's waiting for me.
Sonny, will you get
outta here? Can't you...?
His dog. His dog
is waiting for him.
You know, man's best
friend. Very loyal.
Fine, son. You go right ahead. Go
right along. One upstanding boy.
All right, here we
go now. All set? OK.
Everybody say "chow mein."
-Chow mein.
You must get home
as fast as you can.
Take the first means of
transµo_ation you see.
And that crazy kid
took my car. After him!
Everybody mount up.
Get that crazy kid!
Get on the radio.
Emergency. Call headquarters.
l want an APB sent
out on that kid.
All right, Woodward. Burn
rubber to headquarters.
Hold it iust a second.
A fine example
of young America.
Oh-ho-ho!
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Chief, your gloves. -Forget
the gloves, you idiot!
Shoot me down!
lt's been almost five hours.
l know Schuyler real well.
He's just not the type of
guy that'd go wandering off
for that length of time without
at least phoning somebody.
Officer, you're not listening to
me. -Maybe you'll listen to me.
What? Well, of course this is
Dean Higgins. Wants to know...
Who else would it be? -But Dean
Higgins, a boy out looking for...
You should have sent
someone out here by now.
l know he's on his way, but
so is Christmas. Wait a minute.
l think I hear someone now.
Could he have picked
up a friend on the way?
Sounds like he
picked up a couple...
Listen, l'd better
get some satisfaction.
l'm sure l've waited
long enough. Ridiculous.
l hate to tear down the
police department, boys,
but here we have a
young fella kidnapped.
They could at least send one person
out here, but it's the same old story.
There is never a cop
around when you need one.
Brutus.
Brutus.
Brutus?
Hi, Brutus.
l'm sorry about the bail money. -Sorry.
"Sorry" doesn't feed the bulldog.
And you're paying me
that money back. $100.
Can you imagine, Quigley, paying
$100 for some shenanigans like...?
What I don't understand,
Schuyler, is what
you were doing in a
Chinese restaurant.
l don't understand either.
l don't remember anything.
Didn't happen to talk to anyone,
did you? -I don't think so.
He doesn't think so.
-Well, think hard.
You didn't happen to talk to anyone
about anything important, did you?
Important? -He means
about the formula.
Oh, of course not. Don't
worry about the formula.
I got that all
locked away up here.
Up with Krinkle, down with Crumply!
Up with Krinkle, down with Crumply!
Up with Crinkle, down with Crumply!
Up with Crinkle, down with Crumply!
All right, all right.
Cereal history is
about to be made.
Gentlemen, it works. I can feel
the blood rushing through my veins.
lt makes me feel so young,
so strong, so... so...
Uh, vibrant? -You've got it,
Becker, that's it. Vibrant!
Feel that. Feel it,
feel it. -What? What?
Feel it. Don't hold back.
Feel it! Feel it, feel it.
You'll wrinkle the
suit. And now what to do?
Sir, with your strength, if I were
you, l'd do just whatever I wanted...
Ah! Good thinking, Mertons. And
I know exactly what I wanna do.
What l've wanted
to do for years.
Great-grandfather
Krinkle, l'm so sick
of you sitting there
looking down at me,
watching everything I do!
Not that! -Not our founder.
Oh, yeah. I guess you're right. Excuse
me, Great-grandfather. I lost my head.
So you think we're number
one, do you, huh, do you?
Yes!
Do we deserve to
be number one? -Yes!
Gotta prove it. Think we
can prove it? -You can do it.
l know, men. I know.
The weights. No,
they're too easy.
The lights! That
would be silly.
Ah! I have it. You know that Dean
Wiggins split that cheap tabletop
of Harriet Crumbly's
with a karate chop. -Yes!
Can I do less with
this? -Perfect!
Gentlemen, stand back and
watch out for splinters.
48.5, 49...
49.5... -49.5...
50 Gs. -50 Gs. Cookie,
we're on top again!
Good news. That
must be him now.
Hello. It's him.
Hello, Mr. Krinkle.
How are you?
What do you mean, it didn't work?
-It didn't work. And I can prove it.
I can't believe that.
-Well. believe this.
lf Medfield wins that weightlifting
contest, we're all gonna be through.
Can you imagine those skinny punks
defeating a great team like State?
That's ridiculous.
-Yes, it is ridiculous.
Wait a minute. It
really is ridiculous.
Look, Mr. Krinkle, if the formula
doesn't work, it's all the better.
lf it doesn't work for us,
it doesn't work for them.
lt just means that Harriet
Crumply will be destroyed.
She'll have a bunch
of weaklings eating
her cereal on TV with
the formula in it.
Now, what if the
sure winner the
greatest weightlifting
team in Am' erica,
was seen eating Krinkle Krunch
cereal just before the match?
What would that do for
us on national TV, huh?
He likes it.
Yes, I can handle
it. And Mr. Krinkle,
try and be there. You'll
love every minute of it.
"Love every minute of it"!
No, no, no. l'll take care
ofthis until after the match.
But why? I just heard you tell him he
had it made. I mean, what could happen?
Probably nothing, but you'd better
have some boys lined up just in case.
Medfield had the right
formula once before.
Let's make sure they
don't get it again.
l'm telling you,
it's gonna be a cinch.
You saw me when I
lifted that heavy guy in
Dean Higgins' office.
He was like a feather.
And remember the look on Dean Higgins'
face? And the basketball backboard?
l really can't take
any credit for it.
Schuyler, it's your
cereal. It's terrific.
l mean, the second you guys eat the
stuff, you're gonna feel like giants.
We'll murder those guys.
-All right, let's go!
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
l'm warning you, Higgins. You've been
dragging us out to these foolish events
for the last 30 years,
and you never had a winner.
This is your last chance.
l'm sick of it. Sick...
We're all sick of it, Higgins.
-We're all sick of it, Higgins.
Well, gentlemen,
Regent Appleby,
l think I can assure you, you
won't be sick this afternoon.
l'm telling you for the last time,
Higgins, you'd better have a winner.
You can say that
again, Appleby.
l'm telling you for the last time,
Higgins, you'd better have a winner.
Ladies and gentlemen of TV land,
it looks like we're about to begin
this much-publicized
match of the century.
And now. sµonsored by
Aunt Harriet Crumµly
and her new vitamin-enriched
cereal. Suµer formula X.
we µresent the
Medfield Wildcatst
And sµonsored by
Horatio Krinkle
and nu_ured by the
world-famous Krinkle Krunch.
we µroudly µresent the
national chamµion State teamt
You know, on the
surface this does look
like a terrible mismatch,
doesn't it, Harry?
Yes. But we know
better don't we, Quigley?
Good luck.
l'm not sure if we're
having a weightlifting
match or a
cereal-eating contest.
Hey, you coming, Dexter?
Uh, yeah, l'll be right
with you. -Something wrong?
Huh?
Uh, no, nothing at all.
-Good. I feel great!
There will be a mo-minute warmuµ
before the comµetition begins.
Breathe out! Come
on, Tyler. Let's go.
What's the matter,
Dexter? -Plenty.
Professor, we got trouble.
The formula doesn't work.
Doesn't work? Dexter, how can you
say it doesn't work? Look at them.
Yeah, look at 'em.
They're just carried away.
They're just psyched
up, l'm telling you,
but they're not any
stronger. Schuyler,
you didn't change anything,
did you? -No, l'm sure I didn't.
It's just not the
same. -It isn't?
Well, gee, I can't understand
what could have gone wrong.
lt's missing something.
No smoke, no nothing.
But, Dexter, what do
you think is wrong?
l iust don't know. It's...
Wait a minute.
The acid taste. It had
an acid taste before.
But a vitamin formula
like mine wouldn't
have an acid taste.
That's impossible.
You're right. A vitamin
formula wouldn't,
but mine would. It had
a definite acid taste.
That day half of my formula
was missing. -What day was that?
The day all that stuff
got knocked over in
the lab. The day the
cow gave all the milk.
That was the day before l
ate the cereal and got strong.
Schuyler, somehow my formula
got mixed up in the cereal.
lt was my formula that gave it
the strength, not the vitamins.
You mean my formula didn't
have anything to do with it?
l don't know, Schuyler.
All I do know is
that we don't have
the right formula now,
and if we wanna win, l'd better
get the right one in a hurry.
Good, l'm glad you're doing something
about it, but by all means get going.
Will all contestants
clear the floor. µlease?
Schuyler, give me
the keys to your car.
l ran out of gas just
as we got here, remember?
How about yours, Professor?
-I came over with Dean Higgins.
The first
contestant for State,
attempting 250 pounds,
Ambrose Joykowski.
Arno, this is Harry.
You got the guys? OK,
here's what you do.
Dexter Riley. He's
one of our contestants.
Say hello to the
nice gentlemen.
Hi. Dean, could I have
the keys to your car?
One of our better students too.
The keys to the car? Certainly.
Thanks, Dean.
Oh, that Dexter Riley. Been
around here a long time, you know.
He's a senior now, but I remember
when he first came to apply.
He came to me
personally. He said
"Dean, can I have
the keys to your car?"
Well, naturally, I
said no because the...
The keys to my car! He's
got the keys to my car!
lf that lunatic so much as scratches
one bit of paint on that car, l'll...
Uh...
Nice boy, that Dexter.
Nice boy. See him? Nice.
Won't be the same
when he graduates.
for Medfield. attemµting _75 µounds.
will be Peter "Porky" Peterson.
275 pounds. He'll rip that off
easy. -Yeah, we'll be ahead already.
What is that thing? He's not
lifting weights for us, is he?
As you in TV land will
notice, the Medfield
contestant is a little
bit out of shape,
but don't let that fool you.
Remember, the cardinal
rule of any sport
is not the muscle you
have but how you use it.
Higgins, what's he doing
now? This is embarrassing.
Attaboy. Take it easy.
lt's OK, Porky. Everything's
gonna be all right.
Put that down!
Gone. Everything's gone!
l'm sorry, Aunt Harriet. l
just don't know what hap...
for State. attemµting _75
µounds witt be Sam Nicotetti.
Professor Quigley.
You know, since the
cereal thing didn't work,
we were just wondering
if maybe you might
be interested in an
honorable surrender.
Sit down, Hector.
Now, look, you guys.
Let's get one thing straight.
This meet is not over yet.
It isn't?
- l've never seen anything more over.
So then Ublenski. of
State. pressed 350 µounds.
Then it was
Medfield's turn again.
Hey, kid. We appreciate
you keeping the speed down,
but don't you think this is
being a little bit ridiculous?
Sorry, but I can't
go any faster.
The next contestant for Medfield
is Slither Roth, who will lift -
that is, try to lift
-100 pounds.
lt looks like they've
changed their strategy.
They're going down in
weight instead of up.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, once
again we have a Medfield contestant
who doesn't look
overly strong, but he
does Iook like he has
a lot of confidence.
l admire that, don't you?
fmen) Oh, no!
He did it!
His muscles seem to have fro2en.
He can't let go of the barbell.
lt's over!
There's the acid taste...
AJ Arno? What are you...?
OK, Dexter. We'll
take that formula.
Uh, why? I mean, it
doesn't even work.
See? -Oh, that's all
right. We'll take it anyway.
Go get it, boys.
It's you! -You leave
me alone, young man.
You were behind this all
the time, weren't you?
l'm warning you, young
man. Now you let me go.
Hey, fellas!
Here's your captain!
Strike!
And now for Medfield's last
contestant and last hope, Dexter Riley.
ln order for Medfield to win, Dexter
will have to lift over 11 OO pounds.
What do you mean, he's
out for equipment repair?
He's gonna need more than
equipment repair to lift that thing.
The referee is allowing Qexter
Riley exactly four minutes...
Four minutes? How can I
get there in four minutes?
l don't know what's
happened with you, kid,
but you sure change
your driving habits fast.
Let me have your
operator's license.
l'm afraid I left it in
my clothes back at the gym.
That iust makes it worse, kid.
Hope you've got license
plates on this thing.
Now t see we're down
to our finat mo minutes.
Now. if Qexter Riley
doesn't aµµear to
peform by that time.
it will be all over.
Two minutes?
