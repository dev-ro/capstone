Ghost House
Take a look around the house.
I'm sure you'll love it.
You couldn't even dream about
finding a house
like this in this city.
Even Jesus Christ himself
couldn't build a better house.
The previous residents rushed
out of Korea unexpectedly...
shortly after they moved in.
Look, there's no need to
paint or wallpaper.
All you got to do is move in.
It's fantastic, isn't it?
It's got the best quality
interior, see?
Can you believe it,
a house with such
a beautiful ocean
view for so cheap!
If you let this chance go by,
you'll definitely regret it.
Deal?
Dad...
Dad!
Dad...!
Dad...!
What?
Why do we have to move
all the time?
Why don't you buy a house,
then we wouldn't have to move so much!
Pil-gi, get up,
it's dinnertime!
Pil-gi!
Pil-gi
Pil-gi, what's wrong? Get up!
Get your hands off,
let me go, you jerk!
The briquette fumes in your
house almost killed my son!
Are you refusing to pay
the hospital bill!
You think it's not fair?
- Dad, calm down!
- Then sue me!
My back is breaking, ass!
We're almost there,
this hill is killing me!
Dad, you got to stop fighting!
However poor we are,
we have to keep our dignity.
I'm sick of transferring
schools all the time!
I hate this shit!
How ungrateful you are! Can't you
see, your dad's doing his best!
Push!
Are you trying to be cheap
about the water?
You telling me that we can
only wash twice a week?
- Pil-gi gonna win!
- No way!
Good boy.
Never lose a fight against
the son of a homeowner.
Let them throw us out! We can
always find another place to live.
Pil-gi is such a pussy!
Hey, man!
Fuck off, we're moving!
Dad, hang on! You'll be okay!
Hurry, he needs a doctor!
Dad!
Doctor!
Pil-gi!
Dad, the doctor's on his way.
You have to buy a house
of your own some day.
Yes, dad.
It's all I ask of you,
live in your own house!
Oh, dad, don't die!
Don't leave me behind!
Residence of PARK Pil-gi
Dad...!
I bought a house!
Dad... this is MY house!
Oh, dad!
Finally, your dream's come true!
My house!
Hello.
- Hey, Pil-gi.
- Can you hear me?
I can hear you fine.
Oh damn, the reception
here is really bad.
You must be tired,
take it easy, honey.
I'm fine!
Come and have a look
over the weekend.
So you finally bought a house,
and you know I don't like working.
Can I finally quit my job?
No way! You know
we both need to work.
Both of us earning is best.
Leave the picture hanging to me,
all right?
I hung one, already.
Hello. Hel...!
Hello!
Damn.
What the...!
What?
How the hell did this fall?
Man, on the first day!
Why won't this nail go in?
This is really annoying!
No, this is my house.
I got to suck it up!
Shit, I got to piss!
What the...?
Did I scare you?
Yeah, you did.
- This place is great!
- Isn't it?
Look at the view!
It couldn't be better!
- You like it?
- Yeah!
Soo-kyung, this is the happiest
moment of my life!
Hello, you called for a driver, right?
I'm in front of the bar.
Yes, we can leave right away.
Sir, we're almost there.
Give me the detailed address.
Let's have some more beer!
We've had enough.
Let's go home.
You don't know when to stop!
You should have some control.
Hey, mister, where's the
man who was just run over...
He's gone, see.
You bastard.
Drink by yourself from now on.
You son of a bitch!
This isn't a crosswalk.
Shouldn't jaywalk! Be more careful!
This job is killing me!
Stop complaining and do your job.
Just forget this ever happened,
that's all.
- It makes your life easier, right?
- What do you mean?
Don't be a bad drunk!
I couldn't be a better drunk!
Well, hello,
what a finely built young man!
I haven't seen you around.
Are you new here?
Yeah, sorry, I should've
said hello earlier.
Oh, you probably moved into the
apartments up on the hill, right?
No, I live in the house
behind the complex.
That's right. I bought it.
Have you found...
anything strange about it?
What do you mean?
What are saying?
The house is haunted?
Which is the reason why
it sold for so little, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Listen, I'm not in
a mode for jokes.
So cut the ghost shit out!
You're not making any sense?
Then what, I'm a ghost too,
is that right?
Calm down, I'm just warning you
to take care of yourself.
How the hell does this
fall off the shelf?
Only weak-minded people
see illusions of ghosts!
Do I look weak to you or what?
No, you look very manly.
Let me show you something.
Don't worry about a thing,
even if there is a ghost.
You know what?
I was a marine!
And marines can handle anything,
even ghosts!
How much!
35,000 won, honey.
What?
35,000 won.
Hey, what kind of market
do you think you're running?
The sign outside says
'Super market' right?
The basic idea of super markets
is to give discounts!
A 10% discount for all customers.
So, it's 31,500,
not 35,000 right?
Man, I should've wrung out
the wet rags!
Hey!
You don't know when to
shut the fuck up!
Get off of me, please!
- Just sing.
- What?
I said, sing!
What do you mean sing!
If you don't, I'll beat
the hell out of you.
Do you know
how embarrassing it is!
Sing, or I'll break you neck!
- Any requests?
- Anything.
Those damn punks are
driving me crazy!
Oh, I may be young to you~
but do not say
I'm too young, babe~
Oh, my mommy.
Pil-gi...
Leave this house now!
If you leave now,
you can still live.
Leave, if you wanna live.
If not, I'll kill
with my bare hands!
Die!
Do you want to die!
With my bare hands!
Get the hell out.
Die!
Stop, no!
Leave, this is MY house!
Leave, this is MY house!
Please don't do this to me!
If you wanna live, get out.
Officer, help me!
My house is haunted.
I saw a ghost.
I saw a ghost in my house!
What're you talking about?
Come in.
Where the hell
did you see the ghost?
- Wait, I'm scared!
- Stop being a baby!
I swear, it threw
a knife at me.
I got no idea.
Hey the only thing
I see is your underwear.
Come in and take a look.
Come on, hurry up!
So you got drunk
and had a fight, right?
No way! I haven't
had a drop to drink.
So why the hell is
your house such a mess?
I told you, the ghost did it!
Are you playing us for idiots?
Come and show me.
The couch started dancing
and it attacked me!
And the knife...!
Oh my, this is crazy.
Then look, turn the TV on!
The guy on TV turned into a ghost...
and crawled out of it like this!
Are you taking police officers
for pushovers?
No, but just 5 minutes ago...
You have any idea
what we police go through!
We look for the missing kids,
and get all kinds of crazy calls.
On top of all that,
we get drunken idiots
taking leaks at the station.
We're fucking busy handling
all this shit!
And now we got to deal with ghosts
crawling out of TVs and throwing knives?
Listen, I'm not sure
who threw the knife but...
I got no idea how that
actor crawled out of the TV!
I don't give a shit!
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Wait, officer!
What's wrong?
You look awful!
What are you doing here?
This isn't your section.
- I came by to let you know.
- Know what?
The new foreman's a tough one.
In fact, he's a legend.
He's been working in the field
for 30 years since he was 17.
He was working overseas
for the last 6 years
and has come back.
Pil-gi, come here.
Yes, sir.
Let me introduce you to
the new foreman.
You bastard,
we've met before right?
I guess it was fate that
brought us together, huh.
I'm JANG Kil-bog.
I know what I'm doing.
Leave everything to me.
Wait a minute.
I don't know what you've done in the past,
but over here, rules are rules.
Our team strictly follows
the Q/C plan.
The Q/C? How long did it
take you to develop it?
Five months, why?
Five months?
Well, for me,
being a 30-year veteran,
my eyes and instincts
are all it takes.
Eyes and instincts?
Then what use is the Q/C plan?
Look kid, the world isn't always
what it seems to be.
Hey, are you all right?
What happened?
Nothing happened?
Keep your damn nose
out of my GHOST HOUSE!
Don't misunderstand,
I'm just worried about you.
You don't need to worry a thing!
I told you. Only weak-minded
fools see ghosts.
Want me to show you
how tough I am again?
No, no, that's alright.
There's no such thing as
ghosts on earth. How much?
Let me see...
With the discount! 10%!
You give me such a hard time.
What's with that shelf?
Congratulations,
you're the first one
of us marine friends
to buy a house!
What's with the mess?
Been a little busy, you know.
Anyways everything's
set for your wedding!
You're all staying the night,
right?
So eat and drink
as much as you want!
Hey, looks like you're
scared of sleeping alone.
Get out of here!
No, I can't stay over.
I gotta go home in a few hours.
Oh no, you're leaving so soon?
Change your plan,
and be with us, right?
Hey, I'm starving.
Give me something to eat.
Sit, sit.
- Stop messing around!
- Your feet stink!
Cheers!
Hey, where're the chicks
at around here?
Hey shut up!
I gotta answer the phone!
Keep it down!
Hello, honey.
- Drinking again?
- No way! I'm still at work!
Get your ass home, now!
You forgot your promise already?
- Are you insane, jerk?
- Sorry, honey.
Move your ass now,
or you're dead tonight.
- I'm coming, hon. See you, honey.
- Right now!
Sorry, but I gotta run.
Why? Stay over. All of you!
I'd like to, but my kid's sick and...
I guess we'll go too.
Give us a ride.
But the rest of
you are staying right?
I told you I can't.
It's too late already.
What the...!
You promised you'd stay.
Let's go.
I'm not letting you go!
No, you can't leave.
We're sorry, Pil-gi,
but you know we
can't help it tonight.
What's with you anyway?
I want you to stay with me tonight.
There's something going on,
isn't there?
The truth is that...
this house is...
haunted!
What?
This house is haunted.
I'm not kidding.
- That's bullshit!
- Let's go.
Do you expect us to believe that shit?
- I've seen it!
- Are you crazy or something?
- Hey, what're you doing in the car?
- Let me go with you.
What're doing? Get out.
You get in the back.
Hey, it's your house right!
Forget about the damn ghost.
Let's go.
Get him out!
What's wrong with you man?
Get out, come on!
You're a disgrace to the marines!
Remember,
"Marines can kill ghosts too."
Thanks for the dinner,
call me if the ghost
gives you any trouble!
I wanna go with you
Don't ever come back here again!
Poor boy, I saw this coming!
The ghost came back again!
Again!
Hello!
- What?
- Give me my money back.
- Get off of me!
- Give me my money!
Have you lost your mind?
You knew it all along and conned
me into buying that haunted house!
No one forced you to buy it.
- Quit your crying!
- What?
You liked it and you bought it,
you moron.
And now you're saying
it's my responsibility?
You asshole!
If you're thinking about selling it,
doing this shit never helps, right?
Still you wanna hit me?
Go ahead, stupid ass.
- That house on the hill is haunted...
- Hey lady!
There's nothing to see here.
Mind your own business
You wanna hit me, go ahead!
So you want me
to help you sell it?
Forget it, I won't sell it!
...and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
I am heartily sorry
for having offended Thee,
I firmly resolve to sin no more.
Oh, Lord! Please expel Satan,
all evil spirits, and whatever!

Hey, mister!
You've had enough to drink.
My life sucks. I can't help it.
I worked day and night
to make money...
to buy this damn house...
but I can't even sleep there!
This jacket, I don't know how long
I've been wearing it.
I can't even go home
to change clothes.
Then why don't you go buy some?
That's not what I mean,
no one understands me.
I'm lost.
Hey, give me some more soup.
Long time no see!
What a surprise!
Look who it is!
You didn't bring your friend?
That jerk had other plans,
so I'm here to have a drink with you.
No one believes me. The snake
came crawling of his mouth.
You don't know how to say hello.
What are you
talking about anyway?
- You've met before?
- He's one of my men.
Captain. Mr. JANG.
What's going on?
He's the last person
I'd expect to get this way.
You can't imagine how terrible
things are right now!
So, have you realized
that you can't do everything by
the book or with principles?
But at the same time, alcohol isn't
the answer, either, boy.
You don't have a clue...
about the pain
and agony in my heart!
You don't have a heart!
Don't have a heart?
Never mind, let's just drink.
Man, if you couldn't handle it,
you should've stopped drinking.
You know you're
killing this old dog.
Damn!
Wow, this kid's
got a beautiful house.
I don't know your story, but try
and get along with him, huh?
It is possible for a ghost
and a person to do it.
No! Not here!
No? What am I talking about?
I didn't do anything wrong!
Come out!
You wanna win this house?
Then let's have a fair fight, huh?
All right, you wanna
throw knives. Try it again!
Come out.
Pil-gi!
Yeah, dad.
Because you got a 100 on your
math exam, I'm gonna make you chicken.
Steamed chicken? All right.
This chicken's gonna be good.
Take it easy. Let me check
if the water's boiling.
Oh, Dad!
What happened, doctor!
It's miracle he's alive.
He got struck by lightening twice!
But he doesn't even recognize me!
He will, some day.
Just be patient.
How long will it take?
We're doing our best looking
with long-term therapy, so...
Just think positive,
it's the best thing to do.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, my god
It must really hurt.
Soo-kyung.
Do you recognize me now?
I'll sell the house.
What?
Sell the house!
I'm happy you're
back to your old self!
- Have you seen a ghost before?
- I have!
- What does it look like?
- Like this!
Hey!
You little brats!
A beautiful (but haunted)
House for sale.
Take a look, sir.
Thank you.
Look at the sea view.
It's priceless!
I really love it.
You're lucky. This kind of house
isn't up for sale all the time.
And, look at this top quality interior.
It's beautiful. I love it!
You're absolutely right.
Actually, I wouldn't be selling,
except something's come up
May I ask why?
I'm going to be transferred
to Australia for 3 years.
Take a look at the kitchen.
Nice.
Your right, there's a balcony.
Transfer? What bullshit!
I don't believe he's
such a damn bold liar!
What? Are you with them?
Anyway, I love this house!
You said 'love'?
But you're trying to scam
these people, aren't you?
What are you talking about?
Can you see me?
Of course, I'm not blind miss.
You must have heard
some bad rumors,
but believe me,
they're not true.
Excuse me sir!
Can we take a look upstairs?
Of course,
the 2nd floor has
a better ocean view.
Thank you.
Shall we...?
Look at the two boats
floating on the sea.
It's picturesque, isn't it?
It's goes beyond words.
Come and take a look.
I'm at a loss of words to describe it.
Our kids will love it.
It's really the best choice
for your whole family.
And you can also grow
organic vegetables in the yard.
What a great idea!
Organic food is healthy.
That's right.
But one thing I'm concerned
about is whether it's too windy.
There's nothing to worry about!
This house survived
the last hurricane fine!
Take a look at how strong
this house stands.
In the summer we won't need
air conditioning because of the breeze.
- That's right, it's really cool.
- I can tell.
It would've been good if the kids
could see it too.
It's so refreshing!
It's a ghost...
Wait for me...
- Don't leave me behind.
- Hurry, let's get out of here.
You're... still here?
You should get out, now.
It's because...
I'm starting to lose it!
Okay, I admit it, I lied.
This house is horrible.
So please, get out of here.
I apologize alright.
So stop staring at me like that.
You have to get out now.
You can see... me?
I told you,
it's dangerous to be here!
This can't be happening.
You can see me, for real?
This is not a good time
to be kidding around.
So hurry, let's get out of here!
I'm telling you. You'll get hurt
if you stay in this house.
I can't help you.
Fine, it's your life,
do what you want.
She won't listen to anybody!
What... you?
What are you, twins?
I don't understand
how you can see me.
My answer. I see you with my eyes.
Now, are you satisfied? Get out!
What's going on?
Are you the...?
You can't be seeing me.
You can't be hearing me.
This isn't happening.
I can't believe it!
Who the hell are you?
I'm the owner of the house.
What? Do you wanna die?
You can't believe
what you see, right?
I used to be the same.
I told you, the world
isn't what it seems.
I see a ghost... A real ghost.
You see that guy,
going up the stairs.
He died, in an accident,
8 years ago...
but he's been working,
non-stop ever since.
I was injured in
the same accident, but...
I survived amazingly in a month.
And I've been able to see ghosts ever
since then, whether I like it or not.
Just like you do now.
In time, you'll get used
to seeing them.
There's nothing
you can do about it.
The truth is that humans
are the scary ones.
Ghosts are actually friendly.
This is MY house,
get out of here.
You must be kidding.
This is MY house!
I'm telling you, leave!
No, it's not me.
It's you that has to move out!
So you're staring at me,
so what?
Don't get the wrong idea.
You think I'm scared of you?
Why don't you transform yourself
into something else?
Cause I'm really not afraid of you!
Come out.
Don't be chicken,
come out and get me!
Where the hell are you hiding?
Come on out,
ghost or whatever you are!
You scared of me or what?
Did you run out of tricks, huh?
Let's go head to head.
All right, let's put an end to
this today. Either you die or I die!
What's with this guy?
Is he crazy?
You wanna play games with me?
Come out!
I know you're here!
Let's finish it!
Come out, now!
How come he's isn't afraid!
I'm gonna get you, ass!
You think you're scary?
What a joke!
Next time you're gonna have to do
a whole lot better, got it?
Wanna try strangling me again?
I'd rather watch a scaring movie
than see you!
I'm gonna teach you a lesson!
A lesson about what?
What's it this time?
Man, you're really something!
You did this to the couch
the other night, remember?
What a hopeless girl you are!
All right already!
If doing this make you happy,
go ahead.
I can't believe this!
Who's at the door?
Don't ask me!
What are you filming
horror movie or something?
What's with the costume?
It's too bad.
All that effort for nothing!
Who is it?
Answer me!
You, PARK Pil-gi!
How come you haven't
called me for a week?
Well... I was just...
Are you hiding something.
No way! You know me.
Your girl is pissed off!
- I'm on vacation starting today.
- Oh, you are?
Hon, Soo-kyung, wait!
Oh, she's turned on so easily!
Please have her keep her shirts on!
You're lucky!
Look at her ass!
She's dying to have sex.
Never mind me,
just have fun!
Oh, please, no...
I saw you two doing
it the other day.
You're a crack at it!
I'm soaking in sweat,
pull the covers off.
- No, If you do I'll...
- All right, goddamn.
Soo-kyung, no more, please.
I told you, stop!
Forget it then.
I'm going home.
Hey, I am sorry, Soo-kyung.
Sorry, don't get the wrong idea.
It's not what you're thinking.
Open the door, honey.
Don't take it the wrong way.
This is killing me!
Open the door.
Let's talk about it, okay?
Soo-kyung, honey...
I'm really sorry.
Calm down.
You're so pretty!
Oh, my angel!
What's this?
Oh, I get it.
Since when have you seen
me wearing red panties?
So you've been with some
other bitch in this house!
No, it's all a misunderstanding.
You've cheated on me, damn!
Listen to me!
- It's not how it looks!
- Then what is it?
Just calm down!
You said you loved me,
and so how do you
explain this shit!
Wait, please listen to me.
This is so irritating!
Damn!
I can't believe this.
You bastard, we're finished.
Soo-kyung!
I'll kill you...
Yon-wha!
Yon-wha?
That's the bitch's name, damn!
- She's an LG.
- An LG?
What's that?
There're 2 kinds of ghosts...
One is an LG, meaning
'Lingering Ghost'...
who can't leave the place that
they lived before for some reason.
And the 2nd one is an FG,
meaning 'Floating Ghost'.
And the one in your
house is an LG.
Are you serious?
All right then, tell me how to deal
with this LG, FG or whatever.
First you have to listen to her story
about what makes her
linger around the house.
And then?
You weren't able to win the
fight against the ghost, so...
Now it's time to negotiate.
Whether human beings or ghosts,
communication is key.
None of you can imagine how I feel!
You don't know how I feel...
I didn't do anything.
Hello, please sit.
How cruel!
He needs to learn a lesson anyway.
Why are you so late?
Well, today is KIM's memorial day.
So we had a meeting at his house.
Have you drunk a lot already?
We just started.
Hey, let me pour you one.
Today it's on this boy, so feel free
to have as much as you want.
Hey, I didn't say that.
We're splitting it.
You didn't really help anyway.
"Need a conversation"?
An idiot could've said that!
Okay, I'm gonna give it a try.
But what do we talk about?
What the...!
Are you a bat or something?
It's embarrassing to
see you doing this crap!
You're blushing!
I bet, you must've been practicing
all day to surprise me!
Not really.
Listen, give it rest
and let's talk it out.
I don't want to.
Can you call this
'ghost's self respect'?
Come down, already.
So tell me, what is it
that you want me to do?
That's simple.
Get out of MY house.
You're definitely confused.
It's MY house.
You wanna see the contact?
Or, if you go to the
registration office,
you'll see that the
owner's PARK Pil-gi.
- This is MY house, period.
- Is it?
Then convince me that it is!
I don't need to.
Just stuff you face pig.
What? Watch your mouth.
You don't have any idea
how to show respect?
You started it, jerk.
Jerk? You're really pushing
my buttons. I'll kill you!
You think I'm scared?
What an idiot, I'm already dead!
Crazy ghost!
The negotiation's finished!
That's it!
I'm not making any concessions!
I've never heard of such
a lousy ghost!
Stop eating! I paid for this!
She's not worth giving a try.
What's her story?
She just kept saying
"This is MY house".
And she's sharp with
cursing and swearing.
She must've lived a terrible life!
- And she's even worse than you!
- What the f...!
All you do is talk about
patience and communication.
Sir, this isn't exactly in
accordance with the designs.
Take it easy, it's perfect.
What the...!
She must want revenge
or something, right?
Whatever, I don't give a shit.
I'm not scared any more.
Then find a way for
you to live together.
Ghosts are friendlier than humans,
in a way.
It's not time for joking.
Rumors are going around that
my house is haunted.
A TV station even called me
to cover the story.
Nothing happened?
NO ghosts?
That's unbelievable!
You look good.
Hey, kid, slow down
on the sweets.
Who're you talking to?
You have a younger sister
who died, right.
Yeah!
- She's sitting right there.
- Where?
What's your name? Sook-ja?
Sook-ja, right?
Right!
She's sitting there feasting
on chocolates.
Hey, sweets can spoil your teeth,
so slow down, okay.
Oh my dear sister.
You got a habit of spying on
girls taking baths?
Who me? What are you
talking about?
I'm no pervert!
My husband will come home
any day now, so...
It makes me sick.
Even a ghost changes dresses?
So funny!
This really pisses me off.
You take a bath almost every day.
Think about the water bill I pay.
You don't ever pay a cent of that.
You just idle away time having fun.
And you don't even consider
the living costs!
Don't you have any moral ethics?
What's the use of taking a bath
if you're a goddamn ghost?
According to the project number
60385's plan, we should...
Hello, this is PARK Pil-gi.
That's right...
You wanna buy the house?
Sure, and you've already seen it?
Then why don't we do the
paper work tomorrow?
Don't worry
a thing about how much over the
market price it is.
It would've been so much better
if you all moved out of
these shacks earlier.
Fuck, I'm fed up with
this worthless shits.
Just sign the contract, now!
I don't have time forever!
Hurry up dammit!
Hey.
You gotta stop popping up out
of nowhere like this.
What are you doing?
What's this?
Give me that.
Do I have to report every
single thing I do to you?
None of your damn business.
I'm just...
Just what?
I'm...
I'm moving out.
So you should pack up
your things, if you got any.
They're going to build
something here.
- What did you say?
- I'm moving out.
And they're going to
demolish this house?
Well... they're going to get rid of
the house and build a hotel.
It'll be nice.
You can wait for your husband
in a brand new hotel.
No!
I'm sorry. I understand.
No way!
He was my first and only true love
in the 28 years of my life.
And this house was our dream.
It was everything.
Congratulation on your wedding!
Sorry for such a small wedding.
What're you talking about?
I couldn't be happier.
I'd be so happy living
in a house like this.
- You mean it?
- Of course.
This is... OUR house.
I was going to tell you
once it was finished, but...
Lunch break, come and eat.
- It's great.
- Hurry up.
I'm starving.
I love this house.
When the house is finished,
let's take a trip.
A trip?
It's been three years and we still
haven't gone on a real honeymoon, so...
Really? But you know
I don't mind.
- All right, never mind then.
- No, let's go!
What luck, a typhoon hitting during
our honeymoon. I'm so sorry!
It's fine. I like sound of rain,
and besides you're with me.
Let's eat.
- Well, we have a house now and so...
- So...?
I want to have a baby.
Thanks, honey.
What's going on?
Hey, driver!
What's happening?
Hurry, give me the stretcher.
Hurry!
Hurry up, we're losing her!
Mister, can you help me
find my husband?
Oh, please...
Gi-tae!
Hurry, move.
If this house is gone...?
Please don't let this gone,
what happens to my husband?
I'm begging you.
You can sell it,
but this house has to be here.
I sincerely sympathize with you,
but there's nothing I can do.
Don't cry.
And how can you be so sure
you're husband will come?
If he were alive,
he'd have come earlier.
If he were dead, he'd have come
as a ghost like you.
I'm sure that he's
coming dead or alive.
So don't sell it to this company.
What should I do?
Only if I could see him...
just once!
Then I'd be happy and move on.
You've got to be kidding.
You said yes over the phone!
You want more for it, is that it?
I'll pay 10 million more.
It's got nothing to do with the price.
I just changed my mind, that's all.
Sorry, but try to find somewhere else.
I'll be going.
Well, we've got a problem.
We've already made a contract
with the hotel owner.
Rude son of a bitch!
PARK Gi-tae...
No?
He's not on the obituaries,
so he couldn't
have been on the bus.
He was on the bus I bet, and how
could he have not come, if he's alive!
Please have a look at it again.
Does that mean you know one of
the survivors who were on the bus?
Well, yes and no...
Is it possible this record is wrong?
Well to be honest,
I would say yes.
In cases like this, victims are
taken to ER's all over the place,
and sometimes information
can get mixed up.
And I wasn't in charge of it, so...
What should I do?
Come this way.
You little brat!
Come down from there,
come on.
Hurry up, and come down.
I didn't do it, I swear.
It's mean to play tricks on people.
Did you see the mess you
caused at the police station?
I don't know what happened to you,
but this isn't right.
You might be having fun, but it
causes people a lot of trouble.
You belong to the ghost world
and you can't interfere here.
Yes, sir.
Don't do it again. Promise?
Good boy, now go home.
- Good- bye.
- See you, kid.
I asked all the ghosts around, but...
no one knows where he is.
He's not listed on the obituaries.
He could be hanging around
the accident site,
waiting for his wife?
The accident site?
Some ghosts
just hang around the place
where they died.
He could be waiting for
his wife to show up.
PARK Gi-tae, if you're here,
come out. I wanna see you.
I'm looking for Gi-tae,
Yon-wha's husband.
PARK Gi-tae.
What's he doing here?
Is he looking for any of us?
Hello, guys!
You can see us?
Are you a shaman?
No, not really.
But I'm here to find a ghost.
PARK Gi-tae... wasn't he the
one sitting behind me?
I haven't seen him for 2 years.
No, that ghost went after a girl
who was here for a picnic.
Is it that guy who was
sleeping in the back seat?
Was it him?
No, he was sitting
with a lady, his wife.
Then could it be the couple
sitting in the middle?
I remember we had to wait,
'cause the man came back late
from the rest area.
No, I was sitting in the middle,
and I didn't see any couple.
How do you know?
Yu were changing seats all the time,
looking for the most comfortable one.
How selfish!
Selfish? Me?
Calm down.
I was reading a newspaper.
Hello... what?
Hold on.
Hey, keep it down.
I told you,
I won't sell the house.
No negotiations, period.
Are you threatening me?
It's my house, and I won't
sell it! So what?
Don't think you can
threaten me, shit!
Mind your own business!
Line up just like the night
of the accident!
- Sir... I am af...
- Shut up.
What if the ghost is here?
Don't worry a thing.
Even a ghost wouldn't
dare attack me.
Hurry up, moron.
Over there.
Hurry up. Make sure to hit
the kitchen too.
What are you doing? No!
Did you hear that?
Hear what? Stop standing there
and finish the job.
No!
Get the hell out of here.
Oh, no!
Get out!
Hurry!
Dad.
Dad...
I'm happy you got yourself such
a beautiful house, sorry I'm late.
No, that's all right.
Dad, I missed you so much.
Don't worry, this house
has a strong frame,
so all you'll have
to do is remodel.
It's time to say good-bye.
I wish you and your
new family happiness.
And Yon-wha, get along
with my son, all right?
Let's take a look.
It would've been disastrous
if the fire spread to the woods.
I'm sorry to see
your house so damaged.
You should've sold the house
when you could've
gotten more for it.
See what stupid
decisions lead to.
By the way,
I know it's terrible timing,
but there some bad news.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
This is to inform you that
this house addressed
at 43 Jangsungop was not built
in accordance with Art. 9
and 12 of the construction
regulation.
In accordance with Art. 69
of these regulations,
this house is ordered
to be demolished.
One last thing.
It takes effects as of today.
Considering that the fire
here today violated the law...
not to mention that it is haunted,
it's best if this house is demolished.
I don't give a shit. I'm going to keep
this house no matter what.
You officials are taking bribes, right?
Watch your mouth.
- Get the hell out of here.
- PARK Pil-gi!
All right, but let me
tell you something.
I've been in this fucking
business for 20 years.
Remember, I'm one of
the top 10 bastards
in this country for demolishing
houses, right?
You think you win
a war against me?
If you walk away now,
I'll pay for your moving expenses,
but otherwise, you're done for.
Got it?
The deadline is midnight.
You think...
this is going to help?
It will! I'm willing to risk
my life protecting this house.
Don't worry,
I'll make sure nothing happens.
How about...
giving the house up.
What?
I don't want you to get hurt,
my husband may not come.
That's enough.
Just talk with the man
who wants this house, and you'll...
I'll what?
I'll do or get what?
I'll never give up this house.
It's MY house.
And YOUR house... too.
Hey, I don't want you to get hurt.
Just walk away.
Cut the bullshit.
God dammit!
That jerk's a real pain
in the ass!
Sorry, asshole,
you want this house?
Then come and get it.
Don't hold back.
Just do what you got to do.
- Go!
- Yes, sir.
Tear it down, now!
Crush it.
Tear to pieces.
Come on, man!
The cute girl in red shoes will leave.
Now, let's move.
One more song, please.
Fuck! Put the fire out.
Hurry.
Be careful, the house might
catch on fire!
Don't worry I used to be
pitcher at school.
So I helped friends
throw firebombs at demonstrations.
You see, just trust me.
What are you doing
standing around anyway?
I'm helpless out of this house.
The only time I actually need
your powers, and you can't help.
His father dying wish was
for him to have his own house.
So this boy worked like hell
to buy a house,
and he finally made it.
But, as fate would have it
the house is haunted.
And, as it turns out,
that house was everything
to the ghost and her husband,
but when the house
was completed,
she died and
her husband went missing
on the first and only trip
they ever took.
And she has been there...
She yearns to find out
what happened to her husband...
and forever waits
there for his return.
But a greedy
contractor is determined
to demolish
the house any time!
We have two choices,
we can stay here and enjoy our songs...
Or rush to aid of those poor kids.
They're resisting like hell!
In the end, there's nothing he do.
Tear it down!
Yes, sir.
No!
Hey?
I can't hold on much longer.
Get out!
Let's go, hurry.
Hurry, it's getting
more dangerous!
- I can't believe this.
- That's strong concrete.
This can't be happening.
There's no way!
Ram it harder.
What's wrong with this?
It's ghosts.
- Something's going on!
- Evil spirits.
Come down you bastard!
Are you all right?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Just do your job, men.
Pil-gi.
Oh, sir.
I am not too late, am I?
The house was almost done for!
Just do what you came to do!
All out attack!
Attack.
It's nothing.
Stand your ground.
What took you so long?
We almost lost everything.
Fuck, what are you doing?
Snap out of it you assholes!
No, this can't be happening.
Are you all possessed
or something?
You won't believe what I had to do
to get the ghosts support force here.
That bastard!
Don't lay a finger on it!
This is my house!
- Are you Yon-wha?
- Yes?
I heard someone call your name
desperately at the hospital!
What?
I don't know if
he's still there, but...
The man next to my room,
called out "Yon-wha" a lot.
Excuse me, is there a patient
PARK Gi-tae registered here?
Well... not sure,
just a moment.
It works.
Great, it's walking fine.
We'll carry this bear
with Yon-wha in it.
- No, it won't.
- Why not?
She won't be able to
survive in it long.
A woman's body would be
the best for this.
It was perfect.
Who is it?
Soo-kyung?
What's going on?
Are you okay?
I was worried to death!
Come on in.
The bastards did this!
Why didn't you call me?
My boss JANG helped me
out so everything was okay.
Isn't that right?
I didn't do much,
but he's really lucky.
What if the jerks come back
to get revenge?
No way!
He was thrown in jail for fraud
and forging official documents!
I feel terrible, look at this!
Nothing's left. We are going to have
to start all over again.
And it's going to take
a lot of money, right?
Well, what's done is done,
so we'll just have to save up.
We should have that jerk
compensate us for the costs!
What?
What was that?
Nothing. What're you
talking about?
I felt something.
What? Do you feel a pain in your
back or something?
I know there's something going on
that you're not telling me about.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Pil-gi, just tell her the truth
and ask her to help.
Soo-kyung is too strong willed so...
it won't work unless
she's willingly supportive.
Hey, you'd better tell me the truth.
This way.
What?
Why not?
Do you have any idea what
time it is? Come back tomorrow.
We can't come back tomorrow.
I need to see him today.
You can't talk to her like that.
Let's just come back
tomorrow.
It doesn't seem
possible tonight.
You've waited so long,
what's another day?
I've waited so long already,
I can't wait any more minute.
I have my reasons, so please make
an exception this time.
What's more, he's in intensive care,
only family can see him.
I sure he doesn't have any family,
so how are you related?
He's my husband.
I'm his wife.
Security?
Come to the front desk.
Run.
Where are you going?
- Let's go up this way.
- What?
- We have no other choice!
- No, Yon-wha.
You know how much
I'm afraid of heights.
Fine, I'll go by myself.
- Hey, come down!
- Oh my god.
Are you all right?
I can't believe it!
Are you all right?
I told you not to do it.
Your body's that of a 60-year-old man,
JANG, don't forget it.
- Pil-gi, you go.
- What?
- Hurry.
- No I won't.
I'm telling you to go!
- I told you this was a bad idea!
- Grab his hands tight!
It's him, right?
Is it him?
Oh, Gi-tae...
Are you all right, sir?
Honey, at last I'm here.
So, this is why you
couldn't come home.
Sorry, I'm so late.
I should've looked for you earlier.
I'm gonna get the... why?
I couldn't let go, thinking that
you might come back to me some day.
And now, everything's fine.
Nothing matters anymore,
we're together again.
I wouldn't be here if
it weren't for my friends.
How can I ever thank you?
It was our pleasure
Please find a good place to rest.
Thank you
I'll never forget
what you've done for us.
Are you PARK Pil-gi?
We're terrified.
This ghost or monster
whatever it is, is killing us!
It's an LG.
An LG?
It's one of two kinds of ghosts,
and LG means 'Lingering Ghost'...
It's kind of technical,
I'll brief you when
I get the job done.
Have some cold water.
Wow, it's really cold.
I'll tell you what, I'll finish
the job before it warms up.
Whether ghosts or human, having
a conversation is most important.
I don't know what your story is
for living in this house.
But let's have a talk, man to man,
man to woman, or whatever.
No, help me,
not the chicken again!
