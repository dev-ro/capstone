It is a car thief. 
He knows that the alarms work 
with an electronic sensor. 
If you move the door, 
The circuit is completed ... 
and activates the siren. 
Stealing cars from the 14years. 
The truth is ... 
alarms facilitate my work, 
not hinder. 
Let's say someone passes 
and she sees me playing the engine. 
Excuse me, madam, 
This alarm is a crap. 
He knows they are activated 
if someone force a car ... 
or the strike. 
For a mechanism invisible 
inside the car ... 
alarms are activated. 
He also knows that are activated 
so often ... 
in New York 
nobody pays attention. 
I am the Detective Dante Moretti 
the New York Police ... 
work in the theft of cars 
since seven years ago. 
During this period, 
in Manhattan, in order ... 
the alarm did not prevent theft 
of even a car. None. 
Never. 
This is absurd. 
I am Richie Mcintyre ... 
the industry associations 
Trade and Security. 
Today in New York City 
Law 24221... ' 
determines that the alarms 
need to shut down in 3minutes. 
I do not believe it shortly. 
I will say why. 
Let's say the four are ... 
since you're awake and makes a 
hour with your baby with colic. 
So you put him in the crib ... 
Or say you're 
reading to Hegel. 
"The nature of the subject today ... 
is the movement and transformation ... 
but precisely 
is the break itself. " 
You are too donkey 
to understand this ... 
so I read and re read the same 
passage for half an hour ... 
and when you're starting 
to understand ... 
"The result and transformation." 
Or say you 
has no relationship a month ago. 
The reasons for always ... 
boredom, tension, 
market fluctuations. 
But tonight, 
for some reason ... 
Feel an unexpected 
tranquility in that department. 
Come on, David ... 
Déjala! 
Silence, unfortunate! 
As well, Do not want 
wait three minutes? 
Or a minute. 
Or even 30seconds. 
I personally believe 
we do not have to hear this. 
Maybe you think so too. 
But unlike you, 
I do something about it. 
Soy El Rectifier. 
Today in the prefecture, 
Mayor Schnee ... 
received a group of drivers 
whose cars were dañados ... 
by someone who is identified 
The only as Rectifier. 
I am here with the victims. 
This is Allen J. Corpitanni 
New Jersey. 
Can you show us the letter 
he received? 
Can you read it for us? 
Dear Allen J. Corpitanni, 
on the evening of April 3... 
its alarm disrupted 
the citizens of New York. 
Whenever the Rectifier 
or someone in this organization ... 
found a vehicle 
with the alarm activated ... 
for one reason or another, 
is warned ... 
will be the dañado. 
So it will take over the repair 
Cable battery ... 
at a cost of around $ 200. 
Crimes receive post 
harsher sentences. 
The Rectifier. 
Actually, 
REP myself cable. 
not cost me anything! 
The Mayor, however, 
was puzzled. 
I will not tolerate this kind 
terror in my city. 
Mayor, is accused ¿de what? 
We have 316complaints 
against him. 
Each would take 90days, 
adding that it gives almost ... 
78years. 
A search on WOR indicates that the 
Rectifier is a popular figure. 
On Halloween, children 
was dressed in the Rectifier. 
¿Y matter what opinion 
of them? 
I am the Mayor, not them. 
This self-styled Rectifier 
does not pass from being a cheap justiciero ... 
streamlining their immaturity and anger 
impotent in the name of justice. 
The Rectifier, I suppose. 
Sorry, ¿desea something? 
Firstly, I want us 
pay for the window that broke. 
$ 616, plus tax. 
¿Alguien broke a window? 
Yes, someone broke. 
¿Tomó fingerprints? 
They are not mine. 
And if it were ... 
requires a court order to take 
my fingerprints for comparison. 
And for that you need a cause 
probable, that has not, then ... 
Unless you had not been 
already arrested ... 
and fingerprints 
are in the system. 
¿En three occasions? 
Yes, he spent 30days 
in the Municipal Criminal ... 
by breaking the glass of a Lexus ... 
trying to turn off the alarm. 
- ¿Usted is a reporter? 
- I write things, sometimes. 
- If you wish, write 
something from you. No, thanks. 
- I'm not interested. 
- Okay. 
But if I read the Police and 
Press that you are the Rectifier ... 
Mayor stop it. 
The so hates, ¿sabía? 
I hate the most. 
- How you know? 
Schnee hates million. 
I hate to one. 
My hatred is stronger. 
I will pay their expenses. 
I do not mind the money. 
¿Y cares what then? 
What you do, millions of people 
in this city want to do. 
I just do not have the courage. 
Why are you different? 
Perhaps the question is ... 
why people 
endure this? 
¿Porque them are lambs? 
Even looking at the slaughterhouse ... 
Door open to them pending ... 
They fall in a row, 
as if they deserve it. 
There is something pathetic, really. 
Who are you? 
E.K. Filipovna. 
A pleasure, Mr. Owen. 
So began How? How 
became the Rectifier? 
Not being Rectifier. 
We live in New York 
for seven years, at that time ... 
and I loved the city. 
Even noise, in the beginning. 
But after a while, 
began to bother. 
Can yous close the window? 
Why I had ido there? 
That was the first time. 
I did that for two years ... 
as a hobby. 
There are many things absurd. 
The tax system is absurd. 
I know. I am saying that 
Alarms are not necessary ... 
And I say, what can be done 
you about it? 
People ... 
- None. 
- I'm trying to talk. 
- He played something. 
- I do not think ... 
- Silence, unfortunate! 
- David ... 
For! 
Ven. 
Come here. 
- Ignore it. 
- I hate this. 
Ignore it. 
No problem there. 
- If there is, yes. 
- There is nothing. 
- If there is one. 
- David ... 
Thank you, God. 
Look there. 
- ¿Es his car, Lord? 
No, it is not. 
What is doing here? 
What should have said is ... 
The alarm is ringing 
six hours ago ... 
my daughter is sick, 
can not sleep. 
Just came to disconnect the battery 
so that she can sleep. 
It's like you feel, but cars 
are privately owned. 
You can not force them, 
should call. 
I know that. 
But what I said was ... 
to call the police three times. 
In fact, only two were. 
We came three times 
and the alarm was not sounding. 
It is because for one minute 
at intervals and re-sounding. 
If it had been 
more than 30seconds ... 
had heard! 
So instead ... 
why not again with her daughter ... 
and will see if she okay? 
You do not need this confusion. 
I solve this. 
- Thanks. 
Come here. 
Thank you. 
You are great. 
Take care. 
It happened this. 
¿Me stop by this? 
Suéltenlo! 
Why not stop the dueño 
the alarm ... 
that leaves no-one to sleep? 
So they took me to jail, 
at the time they handcuffed me ... 
I felt calm, 
calmer than ever. 
What did he? 
Forza a car 
whose alarm was activated. 
Who will take you to pieces? 
They took me to Central ... 
and the next morning 
We were placed in a car ... 
and taken to the Criminal Court. 
We were in the car 
for one hour. 
Nobody spoke. 
None of us said one 
word for an hour. 
What? 
We are watching! 
Leave there! 
What are you doing? 
Why change the channel? 
They were not looking. 
Then, I understood. 
It was just to remind us 
I was there ... 
we were 
under the power of them. 
What was doing 
Volkswagen in the red? 
I tried to turn off the alarm. He 
five hours that was ringing. 
¿Quiere say that the forced 
to turn off the alarm? 
It's what every car thief 
said when caught. 
What funny! 
Being prisoner was the best thing 
I happened ... 
in the Hegelian sense. 
It was the negative 
I turned ... 
and took me to be 
what I actually was. 
What was you? 
The Rectifier. 
In potential. 
¿En potential? 
My transformation occurred. 
Exit here. 
¿Usted is a writer? What 
ago in a furniture store? 
Working with my uncle, sometimes. 
The let me use the office. 
¿Para what? 
Locating crazy, 
deliver them to justice. 
What happened afterwards. 
That said Helen to go home. 
I think you need 
be imprisoned more times. 
Maybe come back. 
Everyone laughed ... 
but felt he could 
Back in the morning. 
I thought that it was not possible 
do anything about noise. 
But when you start, 
is easy. 
It is difficult to stop. 
So Do not was the first time? 
¿Desde when you do this? 
- Two years. 
- ¿Dos years? 
I've never done anything so serious. 
In most cases, only ... 
emptied tyres, booted 
Cleaner for breezes ... 
things like that. 
¿Y never think that we can 
be caught? 
What else is not? 
There are many things 
not you. 
I am not forcing 
cars and being arrested. 
You become an offender, 
a villain. 
Okay, I am a criminal, 
but I am not a terrorist. 
Come on, David! 
We have a daughter. 
We have to be adults. 
I am an adult, 
I employment as adults. 
Not imagined that our life worth 
so little to make the risky way. 
¿Cuál is the purpose of this? 
It makes no sense. 
not harass! 
Damn. 
I do not understand because llevas 
particularly for the staff side. 
You know ... 
¿tú you think the noise 
is addressed directly to you? 
I do not think that is addressed to me. 
I am angry 
is the indifference of them ... 
in relation to me, 
to you, everybody. 
Close the window. 
You know, not think about it. 
I can not. 
Do not you close the window? 
¿Y if I want it is open? 
I understand. 
You do not want to close it. 
What I do, turn on the air conditioning, 
I wear ear plugs? 
That's it. We can buy 
these devices silence. 
¿Y other people? 
- What other people? 
- People in cafes open ... 
people who work 
in parking lots ... 
they can not close the window 
and do not have air conditioning. 
¿Necesitamos worry 
by them? 
This is a global problem. 
I know that is not serious 
as global warming ... 
or funds for music 
camera, but ... 
affects people every day, 
millions of people ... 
million people 
every day. 
¿Y you want me 
adapt to this? 
What else can we do? 
Helen, ¿Y if Jonas Salk 
would have had this attitude ... 
in relation to Polio? 
- It is only Polio, adáptense. 
- You think ... 
¿que're a Jonas Salk? 
Okay, love. 
I-I love you, Jonas. 
-- To! 
For! 
- I am speaking seriously. 
I-I love you. 
I am speaking seriously. 
¿Tu for? 
I will stop, and stop. 
Why? 
Well ... 
Helen does not like, 
cree que crazed. 
This does not mean you need 
endure the noise. 
I would stand. 
Sometimes I Broto, 
but normally the stand. 
- Well, we support things worse. 
- ¿Por example? 
Depression, 
Stratospheric taxes ... 
- financing of the house. Do not you notes? 
- Nothing is perfect. 
¿Nada is perfect? 
Robbie did not understand. 
I thought you were stopped. 
Nobody understood. 
So I tried other methods. 
When found an alarm 
activated, the board noted. 
Pay $ 150annually on one site 
Access to register cars. 
I think that ... 
Then, processed recidivists 
in the Court of small causes. 
¿Estás with us, David? 
It is a deduction of accounts 
EDCP's not taxable. 
Line 23... 
His Señoría, activated the alarm 
disrupting peace ... 
losses to business ... 
and the loss of not dream of hundreds, 
but Newyorkinos million. 
not to place! 
His Señoría, we have neighbours, 
associations in the neighborhood ... 
-- Until firefighters. 
-- Not to place! 
It has been proven 
that above a certain level ... 
noise can be 
physical aggression ... 
that can ... 
not to place! 
It was fun the first time. 
He had a charm exotic. 
- Now is boring. 
- I apologize. 
30day suspension. 
If I see it back here, 
execute the sentence. 
This is absurd, is ... 
Alien. 
It has no grace. 
Why the house Menyatic 
still for sale? 
I do not want to move Menyatic. 
- We can return to Wheatneticut. 
- ¿Quieres back there? 
No, I ... 
not supported noise, but not 
want to live where it is quiet. 
Because it is wrong. 
The noise is bad. 
- ¿Será that I am the only one to whom 
matter? - Many things are wrong. 
Many things. 
What will you do? 
Nothing, nothing, nothing, 
nothing, nothing, nothing. 
I want to go to therapy. 
There is a psychological problem, 
is a social problem. 
Political ... responds then. 
We are talking now! 
You're having an outbreak. 
Do not you realize? 
Only you do this, 
just talking about it. 
You're obsessed! 
It is affecting Chris. 
How that is affecting Chris? 
She is constantly asking 
because his dad was so nervous. 
The professor says 
she is irritated ... 
and asked whether the case 
something at home. 
- Perhaps the problem is the teacher. 
- The problem is not the teacher, is you. 
You need to stop this. 
Only ... 
let it go. 
I can not, ¿bien? 
I can not. 
I can not. 
Then go. 
Múdate. 
Okay, we're going to the countryside. 
I paid the house 
my brother this weekend. 
Only this weekend. 
To view. 
Only to see. 
What is she doing? 
Playing with the dog 
the neighbor. 
¿Y what is this, 
is flying sheets? 
Yes. 
Some cities have 
laws against this. 
This not. 
I thought that the area was calmer, 
but the noise is more annoying. 
Who's Evan? 
Caitlin's father. 
Watch this, the strip on the street. 
After fly again. 
¿Será you think 
that it uses gasoline ... 
does not pollute, does not make noise? 
No. 
Why not use a rake? 
- Where you go? 
- A talk with her. 
apologize! 
- Can yous extinguish this, please? 
- What? 
Can yous extinguish it? 
- We came to spend the weekend ... 
- Do not have a rake? 
- A rake. 
- I. 
- ¿Tiene a rake? 
- I. 
Do not use it know? 
¿Fue the parent 
discussed with you? 
The mother. 
It was my fault. 
- ¿Tu resuming them? 
- No. 
The sirens sang again 
with their voices irresistible. 
Ulisses shouted and Lucho, 
until you are exhausted. 
And when the island of sirens 
behind us ... 
what their men released 
and removed the wax from their ears. 
Good night, daughter. 
Helen left it unclear. 
One more failure and I was out. 
She believed that I had no 
maturity to have a family. 
- ¿Madurez? ¿Ella said that? 
- Do not talk seriously. 
- I was afraid. 
- ¿De what? 
¿Está married? 
No. 
This is great, these things! 
Anyway, after that I 
mind that had to endure. 
As everyone. 
Then bracket. 
Support electric saws 
that firefighters encendían ... 
just to see 
whether they were working. 
Support cranes 
working throughout the morning ... 
and whose helicopters 
silencers do not work. 
Support the noise of buses, 
with tractor ...
machines to wash the sidewalks, 
the fire trucks ... 
machines, saws ... 
hoists, 
stereo equipment ... 
garbage trucks. 
They can kill 
of a shock.

¿L? 
You have a second chance. 
What wonder! What is it? 
- Mozart.

No, I'm hungry. 
¿Quisiera say another letter

Truth! 
What are you doing? 
That's my car! 
- Why not turn off the alarm? 
- Paris in a minute. 
I can not wait! 
Where is the control? 
It does not work! 
What do you want? 
To pull that crap 
to not work. 
Do not be ridiculous. 
Officer, officer!

It knows it can not do this. 
You should call us. 
-- You never come! 
- We are here now. 
Because broke the glass. 
They do not come when we attacked a car, 
only when attacked a car. 
The car is not attacked. 
So is saying that the car 
is important, and we do not we ...

-- Espóselo! 
-- It's crazy! 
- It is not crazy. 
Only do not know what to do. 
¿Y what does this mean? 
Why not stop

Only for now.

Sorry, cariño. 
It seems so quiet. 
¿Aceptándose so well together? 
She comes out with another. 
I do not know, maybe I like.

- I do not know. 
Because I'm crazy. 
I'm out of control. 
It's a joke. 
I was playing.

The therapist from jail 
said that I'm not. 
¿Sabes what does not endure? 
The anger that you have all the time. 
Like ... 
feel anger. 
- ¿De what you have so much anger? 
- If impotent. 
- Not always, not every night ... 
- Not always sexually. 
but always ... 
always ... 
It is the bell! 
The truck arrived 
to bring your stuff. 
I rented an apartment 
in the 24and 6º. 
When I moved to the center, 
was jobless ... 
without family, without friends. 
All we had was the noise. 
¿Y my money? 
¿Y my damn money? 
We need ...! 
Each night, the same alarm. 
It was not a car. 
It should be a building 
in the radius of about two blocks away. 
¿Pero what? 
Léeme again 
last paragraph. 
Not before that. 
Please ¿tienen alarm here, 
intrusion alarm? 
- We already have. 
- I know I have. 
It is not you. 
- She works well. 
- It is a matter of opinion. 
Sound is night for half an hour 
until 3o'clock in the morning. 
- ¿Sabía this? 
- You can not stop. 
- The transition does not make sense ... 
-- Hello! 
-- Hello! 
One-time. 
Hello. 
Why was that cree 
our alarm? 
Excuse me, there is a man here ... 
I live in front of the building, 
I heard when activated. 
Register ... 
If you do not speak about the environment, 
does not mean the cause. 
- ¿Es yours? 
- Yes. 
Yes, I know, but ... 
If the activity, 
I could tell. 
I can not do this. 
But I will send to the company 
to recalibrate the next time you come. 
¿Tiene a phone to call, 
if it is activated again? 
Well, but 400, not 800. 
- Take one. 
- Only one. 
- I speak with him. Not you, not Jerry. 
It is the business phone, 
Do not have cell? 
- I have no cell. 
- Deliveries to 16hours. 
No, if it does ... 
- Good. 
Well, at 15hours. 
Bye. 
Trey, I went too far. 
Back. 
Excuse me. 
- ¿Está listening to this? 
- What? 
- This whistle. 
- Is the goalkeeper, always does this. 
- How does to stop it? 
- Talk to the concierge. 
Where is the concierge? 
I do not know. 
¿Vive here and do not know 
where to find the concierge? 
Sometimes it is, others do not. 
I do not know where it goes. 
- Do not bother you? 
- ¿Sabe what bothers me? 
- The top of the culvert 
6street. - What lid culvert? 
Come here. 
It's there. 
Again, ¿escuchó? 
Listen. 
Every time a car 
pass on it. 
How can it bother him, 
and not the intercom? 
You heard that, 
I hear that. 
What happened? 
You promised until Monday. 
¿De who is to blame? 
He said on Wednesday. 
Thanks! 
It's funny like that 
I hit. The applause. 
That's when I realized ... 
that was my job now, 
my vocation. 
The same, as Jonas Salk. 
After that, 
I was never caught. 
I stopped being revolt. 
I began to intuit where would the 
and where police would not. 
It was easy. 
Once I opened my hand at all, 
I became the Rectifier. 
What we are doing is 
cut battery wire ... 
Hacking alarms factory. 
Two problems. First ... 
if the car is 
Watch a 9or a Conroy ... 
any decent alarm 
without being factory ... 
have an auxiliary power source 
and not for cutting off the battery. 
Second, and equally true, 
when the cable is fixed ... 
the alarm back to work. 
¿Y-horn of the alarm? 
- ¿Bocina the alarm? 
No, that's old car. 
Now will the horn. 
In this case goes straight 
the electrical part. 
Generally remains 
below the panel. 
It's funny ... 
hear the alarm 
you crazy, but ... 
to wake up 
the sound is good. 
Something melancholy. 
¿Eso you think? 
Yes. 
Son of ... 
I know, I know. 
But I had an idea. 
Follow my logic. 
We put against him, 
we oppose directly, of course ... 
but we can not forget the fact ... 
that is very popular 
among people. 
Shut up! 
-- Forget it! 
- Okay. 
See if we can apply 
the anti-terrorism ... 
-- Against ... 
Mayor ... 
- Unfortunately. 
- We are a hurry. 
Okay. 
¿Ahora? 
This self-styled Rectifier 
does not pass from being a cheap justiciero ... 
streamlining their immaturity and anger 
impotent in the name of justice. 
Looks like fun, Do not? But 
I am doing, not you. 
¿Cree it's easy for me? 
¿Que'm just fiction? 
Perhaps. 
But my suffering as well. 
What is truth. 
And you're sitting there. 
Salt hence, Katia. 
The Rectifier, I suppose. 
What stupidity! 
All this. 
Shipwrecked boat. 
Let me ask you one thing. 
Noise what was going crazy, 
then ... 
moved to Upper West Side, 
when it is more pacific ... 
there, and here is twice 
noisiest. Why? 
It was the only place I found 
that could pay. 
Because you 
Like noise. 
You hate it, but you 
love to hate. It is his muse. 
¿Mi muse? 
You read Hegel, 
but did not understand. 
I am full of Hegel, I would like

You board all their anger, 
Launches on it ... 
and nothing happens. 
The secret of power is to remove 
all responsibility. 
Much more arbitrary outside, 
the more cruel and irrational ... 
what more pleased. 
More than love. 
¿Y what we are going to do about it? 
Break a glass

In you.

Something like that. 
So, I am the object 
and your subject. 
No, nothing to object. 
Both are subject. 
- I am the object and your subject. 
- Do not forget you object? 
Then, when I do enjoy, 
Do not you doing me an object? 
I can not get to enjoy, if you continue 
speaking. Stop talking!

or 30thousand, whichever is less.

used to treat us as radical.

I say. 
If you support the initiative ...

People love him. 
The Rectifier behind

No comment. 
It could convene a jury and make 
this question before the jury. 
If you do not respond, 
could invoke contempt ... 
and sent to jail. 
Forward. 
It is leaving with him, Do not? 
- What you like him? 
Never what I found. 
If you find, I would like 
he was just ... 
with everyone against him 
and fighting for himself. 
I also just 
all against me. 
¿Cree that because I was elected 
with millions of votes, people ... 
are with me? 
They hate me. 
¿Sabe why? 
Because when you're strong, 
no te deliveries. 
When you're not weak, 
as they are ... 
you hate them for that. 
And to govern, it must be a 
monster and be willing to kill. 
¿A who killed? 
No comment. 
Good people 
without success. 
I'm attacked, spat, trampled. 
He knows what he said to my children 
when they were small ... 
even when they spoke with me ... 
and something that happened to them 
they do not like ... 
and they said: This is unfair ...

Di which is nice.

So púdrete.

And more than 10thousand on the minimum ... 
but remember, for less 
one half will be disqualified ... 
we need more than 20thousand.

True, succeed.

I am happy with my appearance ...

What spoils everything.

The beauty that you can not separate 
the appearance. 
I say look in the mirror 
and feel that you are an angel. 
¿Tú you're a monster 
or an angel? 
- Do not I become a human being? 
- No. 
Because human beings 
is not an issue ... 
and the question is to be monster or angel, 
¿monstruo or God? 
Your ...

by alarms and everything else ... 
What do you think? 
¿Estás trying to leave

¿Petición for what? 
To lead the plebiscite 
November. 
There is a proposed revision 
for the plebiscite of November.

- A proposal to revise ...

Well. 
¿Y? 
There can be an initiative 
when there is a proposed revision ... 
unless the Mayor leave 
both to be voted. 
Who proposed the revision? 
The Mayor Schneid. 
- Why did that? 
Well, not told me ... 
but in the 80... 
when Giuliani wanted 
the stadium on the West Side ... 
and residents of Chelsea 
did gather signatures against ... 
The proposed revision to 
repeal the initiative of votes. 
Perhaps Schnee is doing this ... 
to cancel the initiative 
the alarms of cars. 
- This initiative is ours.

Well, then that's it. 
We spent months working 
in this.

It seems the alarm of a car. 
Send it shut down immediately! 
Turn off the alarm, please! 
Turn off the alarm! 
- It was shut off the alarm at a 
minute or two. ¿Un-minute? 
Three minutes per law, is 
playing just 35seconds. 
Can you-open the bonnet, Lord? 
- Sorry. 
Open the bonnet, cut the cable 
and nobody was perjudica. 
- I can not do that. 
- Why? 
- It is privately owned. 
- It is public disturbance. 
- Exactly. 
-- Open the bonnet! 
To a nearly 
one minute. 
¿Un-minute? 
One-minute. 
- Interrupted my work. 
- Until that evil ...

Call the delegation! 
Let this truck

Open the bonnet!

The alarm will go off 
in two minutes. 
¿Dos minutes?

Hear the evil? ¿El car is yours?

-- fail to make it work! 
Loco! Open this bonnet! 
Open this bonnet! 
- I'm trying, is locked ... 
- What are you doing? 
Non-operating control. 
- Do not control works? 
Do not control works? Why 
not disconnect alarm that evil? 
Watch the way she speaks! 
- It is privately owned. 
- My ears are as well. 
And my hearing.

Being disturbed by ... 
Lord, is disturbing, 
attack all nearby. 
Yes!

and prosecuted! -- Yes! 
The alarm will go off

I can not ... 
Sujétenlo. Sujétenlo. 
- Okay.

I can not hear.

¿Hola? ¿Hola? 
Sorry.

a federal judge. 
Damn! 
The Rectifier, arréstenlo! 
Arréstenlo! 
-- Agárrenlo! Llévenlo! 
- Come on. 
Agárrenlo! 
Llévenlo! 
There are 16charges, 78years. 
caught him, caught him, caught him! 
Next case 
Raymond T. Gilson ... 
seeks compensation for damages 
David Owen, the defendant. 
The mayor is very annoying. 
He was unable to close a business 
with the Japanese. 
Mr. Owen cost 
4,500jobs to the city. 
Can you give an estimate 
of injuries on revenue? 
It was high-tech 
High cost, therefore ... 
I would say that injuries are 
nearly one hundred million. 
My wife has migraña. 
The alarm that man took 
a crisis that lasted three days. 
I believe it was judge. What makes 
Witnesses in the bank? 
The judge is, but it is a complainant 
in this trial. 
¿Dos judges? 
It should not be so, 
is very confusing. 
- The jurors can not talk. 
- Only was ... 
making an observation. 
Sorry, Your Señoría ... 
¿El-defendant has questions 
for the witness? - His Señoría ... 
- David, let me handle this ... 
No, I insist. 
Judge Gilson ... 
returning to the afternoon of May 19, 
when the incident took place ... 
- ¿El is also judge? 
- No, it is an idiot. 
- On that occasion ... 
- They are all idiots. 
not bother! 
I think he said, and I quote: 
It's upsetting, attack 
all nearby. 
I am not arguing here 
señor that attacked someone. 
But the judge understands the law. 
Agredir does not require a 
physical attack, ¿o requires it? 
It's true. 
If you rose to arms 
as if someone were to Agreda ... 
and gives the impression of an attack, 
is aggression. 
So, legally speaking ... 
alarms to be activated 
in 5ª Avenue that afternoon ... 
were, in truth ... 
aggression. 
It's true. 
Mr. Owen, note that this evidence ... 
is in favour of the plaintiff, 
Do not señor? 
If I continue, 
will understand my argument. 
Judge Gilson, agrees 
that this experience ... 
was how it felt ... 
¿fue assaulted? 
Yes, certainly. 
Then, it was not just aggression. 
He was also physical injury. 
Yes. 
¿Y what is noise 
the garbage truck? 
¿Camión garbage? 
¿Y when a motorcycle dueño 
pulls silencer ... 
and the sound is like an engine 
reaction walk by your street? 
- Where you want to get there? 
- One day, one day ... 
when investing in trucks 
garbage quieter ... 
that already exist in many 
Countries in Europe ... 
when they banned 
the useless car alarms ... 
and the constant aggression 
warning of thefts ... 
people recall 
as we live today ... 
and they will not understand ... 
devils as the bracket. 
¿Y sounds of stereos? 
- Excuse me, what he said? 
- ¿Está talking with me? 
- Yes, I think it is. 
- Mr. Owen, the jury is nil. 
- Tell us. 
- Continue with your argument. 
- And cars with stereos ... 
-- Car bomb! 
which leave no hear anything. 
- They should not be allowed. 
- Order, please! 
¿Y vans 
leaving under your window? 
-- Noise enloquece me! 
-- Order! 
-- Order! 
- True, the department quivers. 
-- silence in the room! 
- ¿Y ice cream trucks? 
play the same music without stopping! 
- ¿Y covers sewers? 
- ¿Y taxis playing horn? 
¿Y neighbouring learning 
to play the drums? 
¿Y goalkeepers with the whistle 
to call the taxi? 
- ¿Está well? 
¿Y-alarm fire? 
- And .. 
- And the sound ... 
Bottles-breaking. 
- And what's ... 
¿Y the world? 
¿Y this madness of the world? 
Order! 
Order! 
Mr. Owen, please continue. 
It's all I have to say, 
His Señoría. 
Thank you for your patience. 
The verdict is for the plaintiff ... 
and ordered to Mr. Owen 
Judge Gilson to pay the $ 100thousand. 
With permission from the court ... 
I think we can reach 
a satisfactory agreement. 
Stipulates the value of the agreement 
within 10days. Session finished! 
Congratulations, you lost. 
I lost, but win. 
Now we have a precedent. 
The noise may be aggression 
and personal injury. 
Thank you. 
- ¿Puedo forget my payment? 
- Probably. 
Sorry. 
Congratulations. 
- You are an example to everyone. 
- Thanks. 
You are a hero, Dad. 
¿Sabes of that poster 
25banned on the streets? 
Not management. 
Neither yo! 
It caused about six accidents, 
distracting to drivers. 
Take a taxi. 
They poster Luminoso 
Banana front of your face. 
- Do not odias that? 
- I thought they had drawn. 
Put another, and even worse. 
We could see these beautiful buildings 
on the side of the river ... 
and are now blocked 
with those giant screens. 
¿Sabes what I'm going to do? 
I will fly there. 
¿Lo do? 
Vamos! 
¿Lo do? 
No, thanks. 
Now I understood. 
You become the major type, 
and others do not matter, Do not? 
IRAS home to cultivate 
accursed your garden, ¿verdad? 
Exactly. 
Good luck. 
She was right on 
the poster bright, of course. 
But I did not want 
think about that. 
Likewise, I remembered one thing ... 
I happened the first time, 
I was prisoner ... 
in the District 24º. 
What did he? 
Mangle a car whose 
alarm was activated. 
Who will take you to 
be signed? 
¿Destrozó a car whose 
alarm was activated? 
My God! 
¿Y if everyone did that? 
If everyone did that, people 
off alarms, Do not?
