I wanna farm the bunker for some loot.
We're gonna need all the rare drops.

EMERGENCY ALERT
[reporter 1]
Some civilians have become aggressive
and extremely violent,
ruthlessly attacking anyone.
This phenomenon, which began
as a small riot in the Gangbuk District,
is spreading rapidly.
It seems to have already spread
beyond Seoul to a national scale.
[car crashes]
The government is considering declaring
a state of emergency at this moment.

We apologize for the interruption
due to an unstable network connection.
I repeat.
Due to the rapid spread of the infection
in densely populated areas,
the situation in major cities
have become uncontrollable.
VIOLENT INFECTED RISING
Infected are known
to show violent tendencies,
and the symptoms of the infection
also include episodes of screaming
- and bleeding of the eyes.
- [woman screams]
We have breaking news.
There have been reports of
cannibalistic behavior among the infected.
I repeat.
Infected individuals are displaying
cannibalistic tendencies.
The attacks on innocent civilians
have escalated,
from assault to cannibalistic behavior.
The KCDC has stated
that getting bitten by an infected…
In other words, a bite or stab wound…
Hey, hey, hey. Hold on! Hold on! Hey.
Hey, stop!
Stop. Look.
I'm okay.
Look, I'm…
I… I'm totally fine! No, please.
Don't… don't!
Don't kick me out, please?

DAY 2
[reporter 2] Professor Kim Yeon-jeong,
a disease expert, has joined us.
Professor Kim,
how would you define this epidemic?
[Dr. Kim] Other than the fact that
the infected exhibit behavioral changes,
we don't know anything
certain at the moment.
However, it seems that the extremely
aggressive tendencies and cannibalism
have to do with the brain
of the newly infected.
[reporter 2]
It could be a type of mental illness?
- And not an infectious disease?
- [dial tone]
[operator] Your call cannot be connected
to voicemail at this time.
[Yeon-jeong] However, aggressive
and cannibalistic tendencies
exhibited by those being infected
seem to be connected…
[groaning]
The mutated virus
affects neurotransmitters,
specifically part of the brain,
that trigger violent tendencies.

I've been…
stuck at home for two full days now.
"You must survive.
You must survive!"
That was the last text message
I got from my father.
But you see,
I don't really know
how I'm going to survive this.
It's a miracle that I'm still alive
and recording this right now.
Man…
Well, anyway, my friends.
All right.

[sighs]
DAY 7
[exhales]
Forgive me, Dad.
I MUST SURVIVE
[reporter 3] What we've found
is that the infection only spreads
through the transfer of blood,
which occurs via bites and stab wounds.
The best thing we can do
at the moment
is to avoid being bitten by the infected.
Other than cannibalistic tendencies,
the infected do not seem to possess
a heightened sense of vision,
hearing, and smell.
Also, some seem to retain
certain behavioral patterns
they've had before they were infected.
Things like opening a door or a window.
Some remember their jobs
and repeat specific behaviors.
A wide range of cases are being reported.
- Available for anyone.

But I won't leave the house, never.
I'd rather starve to death than get bitten
and end up like those monsters.
They keep showing the same screen
on TV every day.
They keep saying
everyone should just wait at home,
but I have no idea what's going on.
My mom rarely watched TV.
She liked listening to Internet
shows while cleaning.
She's even sent in her stories
a few times.
[gasps]
The radio.
Due to the recent disaster,
they developed a mobile app for using
FM frequencies without a phone signal
to send out emergency broadcasts.
You can plug in a 3.5mm audio jack
to use as an antenna
to receive signals.
A headphone jack would be ideal.
Shit.
Damn it. Why are they all wireless?

Thank you for the food.
I really enjoyed it.
I should thank you.
For saving me.
Thank you so much.
I didn't save you.
What?
I said, I didn't save you.
You saved yourself
because you wanted to live.
Your eagerness to live
is what's keeping you alive.
[Jun-u] Yeah, but still…
Without you…
If I'd never met you,
I wouldn't be here now.
I nearly died.
I mean, I… I almost killed myself,
you know.
I'm so sorry to hear that,
but can we talk about something else?
What?
If it's alright with you…
I'd love to talk about something,
just anything.
Want to make noodles?
Did you drain them?
There's only a little water.
You have to control the amount
of water and simmer it down.
Simmer it down?
If you want to mix it with rice later…
What do you mean mix it later?
- Do you know how to cook noodles?
- [scoffs]
Who doesn't know how to cook noodles?

Well, you obviously don't know how.
Why wouldn't she pour out the water?
She's weird.
Chapagetti. I think Chapagetti
tastes the best
when mixed with Neoguri. Right?
NEOGURI
[clears throat]
That's way too much food for me.
You can't even finish that?
Eat up, neighbor.
Yes, yes, I'm going to right now.
[Jun-u] Oh… Oh, my.
I wish I could top it off
with a sesame oil.
[laughs]
You're scared of heights?
What? What's wrong with that?
Well, it just doesn't suit you.
You cut off someone's hand,
yet you're scared of heights?
I never cut off anyone's hand.
What?
Those monsters aren't human.
Not anymore.
I am afraid of heights.
I fell while climbing as a kid.

[Jun-u] Since I'm still alive,
I've been stuck at home,
listening to the news.
[survivor] Same here.
But why were you guys together?
You know each other?
[Jun-u] Not really.
We didn't know before this.
We met four days ago.
Hmm.
You've been hunkering down here
all by yourself?
[survivor] Right.
Anyway…
Aren't you guys thirsty? Have some water.
What's wrong?
Right, I… I get it.
With everything that's been going on,
no wonder you've been careful.
Ahh.
Drink it. It's all good.
- [sips]
- You guys must be hungry.
Do you want some food?
Yeah?
Spam.
[both moaning]
So? Do you guys like it?
Yes.
This is amazing.
I'm glad.
- [coughs]
- Slow down. Eat slowly.
Okay, thank you so much.
There's enough food for us to last
until the rescue team arrives.
Rescue?
- Seriously?
- Rescue team?
You didn't hear the news?
Isn't that why you came up here?
You heard it? On the news?
I can catch the signal from time to time.
You guys really didn't hear it?
[scoffs]
[gasps]
[both sobbing]
- [chuckling]
- [gasps]
Uh, yeah.
We need to hold out a little longer.
Wow.
[chuckles]
By the way,
how did you stay hidden for so long?
Hiding is easy, you know.
I had to hide whenever I smoked
because of my wife. That helped.
[chuckles]
Do you… Do you have any children?
[Jun-u mumbles]
Nope.
But you two kids arrived today.
What?
[utensil clinks]
[foreboding music playing]
Sir.
[Yu-bin sighs]
Sir… Sir.
[gasps] Jun-u. Jun-u.
Hey, Jun-u.
[groaning]
[Yu-bin groans]
- [squeaking]
- [groans]
[groaning]
- [gasps]
- [survivor] Just go to sleep.
Good, just like that.
Jun-u.
[Yu-bin] Jun… u.

- [snarling]
- [Yu-bin screaming]
My wife…
- She's been starving.
- [Yu-bin breathing heavily]
Who knows how long she…
she would have starved
if it weren't for you?
I have to do this.
[Yu-bin panting] Jun-u! Jun-u!
I hope you understand.
[Jun-u]
Understand my ass, you fucking nutjob.
Yu-bin!
Yu-bin, are you in there?
Can you hear me?
Answer me, Yu-bin!
I want to save my wife.
What's so wrong with that?
You guys never had to kill anyone?
[Yu-bin screaming]
[survivor] Right.
The fact that we're still alive
means that you and I…
- We're the same.
- Sir.
Sir, just wait please.
Hold on. Let's talk, okay?
All right.
All right, then.
[grunting]
[Yu-bin] Jun-u!
Come on, please!
Why won't you let us live?
Then what about us?
Do you think our lives are worthless?
So leave.
Leave the girl here and go.
[survivor] I'll spare your life.
You can take all the food I've got.
- [screaming]
- [snarling]
Just this once.
- Stay back! Don't come closer!
- Just this once!
If you take one more step,
I will kill you!
Just…
Forget we're here and leave us alone!
- Stay back!
I will kill you!
- [snarls]
- [gasps]
- [Yu-bin screaming]
- No!
Yu-bin!
Yu-bin! Yu-bin!
Honey.
Honey!
- Yu-bin!
- Honey!
It's okay.
It's okay. I love you.
I'm sorry I failed you.
[survivor] It's okay.
It's all right.
It's okay.

[whimpering]

- [creatures snarl]
- [gasping]
[sighing]
Jun-u.
[chuckles]
We're still human, you know.
And we're together.
[somber music playing]
It's okay now.
No.
No.
[whimpering]
[Yu-bin sobbing]
[whimpering]
[crying]
Fuck!
[helicopter droning]
Hold on. Wait. Hold on a second.
What's going on?
What the fuck is happening?
- [sobs]
- My god.
[both gasp]
- The roof. Roof!
- Wait, this thing…
- we need to… - To the roof!
- Hurry! Scissors.
- Fuck!
The scissors!
- [grunts]
- [growls]
[ominous music playing]
[grunting]
Move! Move! Out of the way, motherfuckers!
[Yu-bin] Move! Move!
[screaming]
Come on! Quick! Quick!
- [Yu-bin screams]
- [snarling]
Yu-bin!
- Jun-u.
- Get away!
Jun-u, come on!
Go! Just go!
Get to the roof, signal the chopper!
You have to hurry, okay?
[tense music playing]
[panting]
No.
No.
[grunts]
Fuck! Fuck this shitty apartment!
The chopper. The chopper?
[panting]
[sobbing]
There are survivors here.
We're still alive!
- There are survivors here!
- [banging on door]
[somber music playing]
We're alive!
[Jun-u] There are survivors here!
We're still alive!
Over here!
There are survivors here!
[sobbing]
- We're still alive…
- There are survivors here!
We're still alive up here. Please help us.

MISSED CALLS
YOO: YOU HOME? - CHU: CALL ME
[sighs]
[chuckles]
[laughs]
[sighs]
[reporter 5] Impossible to know
how many people are infected,
but the authorities speculate
that at least 50,000
are infected across the country.
The metropolitan area
was hit especially hard
due to the compact spacing of rental units
within various apartment complexes.
Rescue squads are focusing
on locating and extracting survivors
within the area by tracking SOS messages
posted on social media by civilians.
Each region's internet
and wireless networks
have been or are being restored,
so the SOS messages on social media
have been rather effective.
Each region's Disaster and Safety
Countermeasures Headquarters
will promote a campaign
that encourages all survivors
to post their current locations
on social media.
