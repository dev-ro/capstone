My father's family name
being Pirrup,
and my Christian name Philip,
my infant tongue
could make of both names
nothing longer
or more explicit than Pip.
So l called myself Pip
and came to be called Pip.
Keep still, you little deviI,
or I'll cut your throat.
No, sir, no.
Tell us your name. Quick.
Pip. Pip, sir.
Show us where you live.
Point out the place.
There, sir, there.
Now, where's your mother?
There, sir.
No, sir. There, sir.
AIso Georgiana,
that's my mother.
-Is that your father, alonger her?
-Yes, sir, late of this parish.
Who do you live with, supposing
you are kindIy let live?
With my sister, Mrs. Gargery,
wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith.
Blacksmith, eh?
Now lookee here...
You know what a file is?
Yes, sir.
-Do you know what whittles are?
-Yes, sir. Food, sir.
Get me a file and whittles or
I'll have your heart and liver out.
If you wouId kindIy
let me keep upright, sir,
perhaps I shouIdn't be sick
and perhaps I couId attend more.
Bring that file and them whittles
to this churchyard tomorrow morning.
-Yes, sir.
-And never dare to say a word
-of having seen such a person.
-No, sir.
If you do your heart and liver shall
be tore out and roasted and ate.
There's a young man hid with me.
In comparison with him
I'm an angeI.
That young man has a secret way of
getting at a boy and his liver.
A boy may lock his door
and he may be warm in bed,
but that young man will softIy creep
his way to him and tear him open.
Say ''Heaven strike
me dead if I don't.''
Heaven strike me dead if I don't.
Now you know what
you have promised, young man.
-Get off home.
-Goodnight, sir.
Hello, Joe!
Mrs. Joe's been out a dozen times
looking for you, Pip.
She's out again now,
making it a baker's dozen.
-Is she?
-And what's worse,
she's got Tickler with her, Pip. She
got up and made a grab at Tickler
and she rampaged out, Pip,
and rampaged out.
She's a-coming.
Get behind the door, oId chap.
And get the toweI betwixt you.
You... young...
deviI...
Now then, where have you been?
I've onIy been
to the churchyard.
You'd have been in the churchyard
long ago if it hadn't been for me.
It's bad enough being a blacksmith's
wife without being a mother to you.
Churchyard, indeed. You'll be
having me there one of these days.
Get to the table.
Listen.
Was that great guns, Joe?
Yes, there's another convict off.
-What does that mean, Joe?
-Oh, escaped. Escaped.
One escaped last night,
they fired a warning of him.
This must be a second one.
-Where does the firing come from?
-Drat the boy. Ask no questions...
Mrs. Joe, I shouId like to know,
if you wouIdn't much mind,
where the firing comes from.
Bless the boy,
from the huIks of course.
Oh, huIks.
Please, what's huIks?
There you go. Answer him one
question and he'll ask you a dozen.
HuIks are prison ships
right across there.
I wonder who's
put into prison ships
and why they're put there.
People are put into prison ships
because they murder and forge
and rob and do
all sorts of bad things.
And they aIways start
by asking too many questions.
Now, get on with your supper
and get off to bed.
A boy may be warm in bed.
He may pull the clothes
right over his head.
But that young man will
softly creep his way to him
-and tear him open.
-No.
Wake up, Mrs. Joe.
Wake up.
Mrs. Joe, wake up.
You're a thief, Pip.
You're a thief, Pip.
You'll be sent to the hulks.
-A boy with somebody else's brandy.
-With somebody else's file.
With somebody else's pork pie.
Stop him!
Hello, young thief.
I couIdn't heIp it, sir.
Sir.
-You brought no-one with you?
-No, sir.
-Nor give no-one the word to follow?
-No, sir.
-What's in the bottle, boy?
-Brandy.
I think you've
got the ague, sir.
I'm much of your opinion, boy.
I'm glad you enjoy it.
I said I'm glad you enjoy it.
Thankee, boy. I do.
Aren't you going
to leave any of it for him?
Him?
Who's him?
The young man you spoke of.
Oh, him.
No, he don't want no food.
He looked as if he did.
Looked?
-When?
-Just now.
-Where?
-Over there.
Did you notice
anything about him?
He had a big scar on his face.
-Not... not here?
-Yes, there.
Give us hoId
of that file, boy.
If you're not wanting me, sir,
we have company for dinner.
-And my sister will be up earIy.
-Thankee, boy. Thankee.
This boy ought to be
truIy gratefuI, ma'am,
for the princeIy dinner
you have set before him.
Do you hear what
Uncle Pumblechook says? Be gratefuI.
Why is it the young
are never gratefuI?
-Naturally vicious.
-True. True.
And now to finish with,
I want you all to taste
the delicious, delightfuI gift
of Uncle Pumblechook's.
It's a pie.
A savoury pork pie.
A savoury pork pie!
Let's have a cut of this pie, Mrs.
Joe, and we'll try to do it justice.
Clean plates. CoId.
I aIways say
that a bit of savoury
pork pie will lay atop
of anything you may care
to mention and
-do no harm.
-What's the matter, boy?
Nothing, sir.
I shouId say not.
Enjoying yourseIf with your eIders
and betters, improving yourseIf
with their conversation.
Now then, son, where
do you think you're off to?
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, but
I'm on a chase in the King's name.
-I want the blacksmith.
-What might you want him for, pray?
Missus, speaking for myseIf
I shouId repIy
the honour and pleasure
of his fine wife's acquaintance.
Speaking for the King,
I answer a little job done.
You see, blacksmith, we've had
an accident with these,
and as they are wanted
for immediate service,
-will you throw your eye over them?
-Convicts, sergeant?
Aye, two.
-Have you seen anything of them?
-Heavens preserve us, no.
No, we haven't seen them, no.
Well, we'll find 'em.
Platoon, fall in!
Platoon, attention!
ShouIder arms!
Left turn!
Platoon, march!
If that boy comes back here with his
head blown to bits by a musket,
don't look to me
to put it together again.
I hope we don't find them, Joe.
I'd give a shilling
if they'd cut and run, Pip.
Come on.
HeIp!
Convicts escaping!
-Come on!
-HeIp!
This way!
HeIp!
HeIp!
Over here, quickIy!
This way!
This way!
HeIp! HeIp!
Convicts escaping!
Don't forget.
I took him.
I give him up to ye.
Don't forget that.
Be quiet.
He tried to murder me.
Me try to murder him!
I kept him from getting
off these marshes.
I couId have got clear,
then I discovered he was here.
Let him go free
and make a fooI of me again?
Let me. Let me.
Make ready. Present. Fire!
Hands.
You're expected on board.
Come on.
Light those torches.
Get aboard, you!
Torch bearers!
I wish to say something
respecting this escape.
It might prevent some persons
Iying under suspicion alonger me.
What is it?
I took some food from
the blacksmith's near the village.
Over yonder.
It was a dram of liquor
and a pie.
Do you happen to have missed such
an article as a pie, blacksmith?
My wife did,
the very moment you came in.
Oh, so you're
the blacksmith, are you?
Then I'm sorry
to say I... I've eat your pie.
Oh, you're weIcome to it
as far as ever it were mine.
We don't know what
you've done, but
we wouIdn't have you starve
to death for it, wouId us, Pip?
Give way, you.
Over there.
lt was a year later.
Pip.
Now if that boy ain't gratefuI
this day, he never will be.
It's to be hoped
he won't be pampered.
Not by Miss Havisham, ma'am.
-She knows better.
-Do you know who Miss Havisham is?
-Yes.
-Who?
-The strange lady in the big house.
-But she's mad, ain't she?
She may be mad but she's rich
enough to make the boy's fortune.
She wants him
to go and play there.
And he had better go
and play there or I'll work him.
I wonder how she came
to know our Pip.
Oh! Lor-a-missy me.
Here I stand taIking
to mooncaIves
and Uncle Pumblechook
waiting and that boy
grimed with dirt from the crown of
his head to the soles of his feet.
Ring the bell, boy.
-Name?
-Pumblechook.
Quite right.
-Can you read the time, boy?
-Yes, sir.
A quarter past three.
PunctuaI to the minute.
Let that be a lesson to you.
This is Pip.
So this is Pip, is it?
Come in, Pip.
Do you wish to see Miss Havisham?
-If Miss Havisham wishes to see me.
-Ah, but you see, she doesn't.
Come along, boy.
Your clock has stopped, Miss.
It shouId be a quarter past three.
Don't loiter, boy.
Come along, boy.
Take your hat off.
This door, boy.
-After you, Miss.
-Don't be silly. I'm not coming in.
Come in.
-Who is it?
-Pip, ma'am.
Pip?
Mr. Pumblechook's boy.
Come to play.
Come nearer.
Let me look at you.
Come closer.
Look at me.
You aren't afraid of a woman
who has never seen the sun
since you were born?
No.
Do you know what I touch...
here?
-Your heart.
-Broken.
Sometimes I have sick fancies.
And I have a fancy
I wouId like to see someone play.
Play.
Play.
Estella. Come here.
Your own one day, my dear,
and you will use it well.
Let me see you play
with this boy.
With this boy?
But he's a common labouring boy.
Look at his boots.
Well?
You can break his heart.
What do you play, boy?
-OnIy Beggar My Neighbour, Miss.
-Beggar him!
-Four for the ace.
-One for a jack.
He calls the knaves
jacks, this boy.
What coarse hands he has.
You stupid, clumsy
labouring boy.
She says many hard things of you,
but you say nothing of her.
What do you think of her?
I don't like to say.
Tell me, in my ear.
I think she is very proud.
Anything eIse?
I think she is very pretty.
Anything eIse?
-I think she is very insuIting.
-Anything eIse?
I think I shouId
like to go home now.
And never see her again,
even though she is so pretty?
I'm not sure that I shouIdn't
like to see her again,
but I shouId like to go home now.
You shall go home soon.
Play the game out.
Wait here, boy.
Why don't you cry?
-I don't want to.
-You do, and you're near crying now.
Long after l had gone to bed
that night, l thought of Estella.
And how common she would consider
Joe, a mere blacksmith.
l thought how he and my sister
were sitting in the kitchen
and how Miss Havisham and Estella
never sat in a kitchen
but were far above
the level of such things.
The following week...
You are to come
this way today, boy.
Well, I'm sure.
What next?
-Well?
-Well, Miss?
Am I pretty?
Yes, I think
you are very pretty.
Am I insuIting?
No. Not so much so
as you were last time.
-Not so much?
-No.
Now take that,
you coarse little monster.
What do you think of me now?
I shan't tell you.
Because you're going to tell
upstairs, is that it?
No, that's not it.
Why don't you cry again,
you little wretch?
I shall never cry for you again.
In there, boy.
So the days
have worn away, have they?
-Yes, ma'am. Today...
-There, there.
I know nothing of the days of
the week or the weeks of the year.
Do you know what that is?
There.
-I can't guess what it is, ma'am.
-It was a great cake, a bride cake.
Mine!
On this day of the year
long before you were born,
that heap of decay
was brought here.
It and I have worn away together.
The mice have gnawed at it,
but sharper teeth than theirs
have gnawed at me.
There, there.
WaIk me.
WaIk me, waIk me.
-Dear Miss Havisham.
-Good morning.
How well you look.
I do not look well, Sarah Pocket.
I am yellow, skin and bone.
These, Pip, are my relations,
the Pockets.
They are very particularIy
interested in my heaIth.
So once a year on my birthday,
I summon them to visit me.
-Many ha...
-There.
Pip, my dear, run into
the garden and play.
Estella will tell you
when to come back.
Yes, ma'am.
Hello, young fellow!
Hello.
Who gave you leave
to prowI about?
Miss Estella.
Come and fight.
Oh, just a moment though, I ought to
give you a reason for fighting too.
There it is...
Come on.
Are you satisfied
with the ground?
Quite satisfied, thank you.
Good.
Ready?
Ready.
That means you've won.
-Can I heIp you?
-No, thankee. I'm quite all right.
-Good afternoon then.
-Same to you.
Boy!
Boy!
Yes, Miss?
You may kiss me if you like.
Now you are to go home.
Three months later
my sister became ill
and was buried in the churchyard
on the marshes.
The occasion was marked for me not
so much by the passing of Mrs. Joe,
but by the arrival of Biddy.
Very soon she became
a trusted friend of both of us
and a blessing to the household.
Biddy, I want you to heIp me.
Don't I heIp you, Pip?
Oh, yes, you heIp me
with my letters and figures,
but this is a secret.
Oh, what is it?
Biddy.
Yes?
I want to be a gentleman.
A gentleman?
I shouIdn't if I were you, Pip.
I don't think it wouId answer.
Biddy, I have a particular reason
for wanting to be a gentleman.
Well you know best, Pip, but
don't you think
you're happier as you are?
I'm not happy as I am.
I'm coarse and common.
Coarse and common, are you, Pip?
Who said so?
The beautifuI young lady
at Miss Havisham's.
And I want to be
a gentleman on her account.
-Who have we here?
-A boy.
-A boy from the neighbourhood, eh?
-Yes, sir.
-How did you come here?
-Miss Havisham sent for me, sir.
Well behave yourseIf. I have
a pretty large experience of boys
and you are a bad lot of fellows.
Now mind you behave yourseIf.
Yes, sir.
Take this in there, boy.
-Yes, Miss.
-From this moment
l entered upon the occupation of
pushing Miss Havisham in her chair.
As we became to be
used to one another,
Miss Havisham
asked me questions as to what l had
learnt and what l was going to be.
Estella was always there
and always let me in and out,
but never told me
l might kiss her again.
Sometimes she would
coldly tolerate me
and other times
she told me energetically...
I hate you.
My admiration of her
knew no bounds
and scarcely a night went by
without my falling asleep with the
image of her face before my eyes.
One day...
Does she grow prettier
and prettier, Pip?
Yes, Miss Havisham.
There, there.
That's all till next time.
Miss Havisham.
I can't come next time.
That's sad news, Pip.
Why not?
Tomorrow is my birthday
and I'm fourteen.
And you start your apprenticeship
with the blacksmith, do you not?
Yes, Miss Havisham.
Why so glum, Pip?
Are you not excited
by your new venture?
I used to think I wouId be,
but I'm not now.
Pip.
Here are some goIden sovereigns.
A gift from me.
-Thank you, Miss Havisham.
-Do with them what you please.
You've earned them well.
Thank you.
Come and see me
on your next birthday.
-Yes, Miss Havisham.
-Estella, show him out.
Goodbye, Miss Havisham.
Goodbye, Pip.
You had better say goodbye
to me because I'm going away too.
-Going away?
-Yes.
I'm going to France
to be educated for a lady.
-To be educated for a lady?
-Yes.
Well?
Aren't you sorry I'm going?
Yes, Estella.
I'm very sorry.
I wish I knew when you
were coming back. I wish...
-What do you wish?
-I wish I couId kiss you goodbye.
My boyhood had ended
and my life
as a blacksmith began.
lt was in the sixth year
of my apprenticeship
and it was a Friday night.
Are you the blacksmith
by name Joseph or Joe Gargery?
Yes, sir.
Have you an apprentice commonIy
known as Pip? Is he here?
I'm Pip, sir.
-So you're Pip?
-Yes, sir.
My name is Jaggers.
I'm a lawyer in London.
I wish to have a private
conference with you two.
We had better go into the house.
Now, Joseph Gargery.
I am the bearer of an offer to
relieve you of this young fellow.
You wouId not object to canceI his
apprenticeship for his own good?
You wouId want
nothing for so doing?
Heaven forbid I shouId want anything
for not standing in Pip's way.
Very well then.
I come now to this young fellow.
And my communication to him
is that he has great expectations.
I am instructed
to communicate to him
that he will come into
a handsome property.
Further, it is at the desire of the
present possessor of the property
that he shall be immediateIy removed
from his present sphere of life
and from this place and brought up
as befits a young gentleman
of great expectations.
Now, Mr. Pip, you are
to understand that
it is at the request of the person
from whom I take my instructions
that you aIways
bear the name of Pip.
If you have any objection,
now is the time to mention it.
No... I... have no objections.
I shouId think not, indeed.
SecondIy, Mr. Pip,
you are to understand that the name
of the person who is your benefactor
is to remain a profound secret
untiI the person
chooses to reveaI it.
If you have any suspicion as to
whom that person might be,
keep that suspicion
within your own breast.
If you have any objections,
now is the time to mention it.
Speak out.
I... have no objection.
Now, Mr. Pip, kindIy
consider my your guardian.
I... Thank you, sir.
I am well paid for my services,
otherwise I wouId not render them.
I have arranged for you to go
to London in a week's time.
You will need
some new clothes.
They shouId not
be working clothes.
Twenty guineas.
Well, Joseph Gargery,
you look dumbfounded.
I am.
Then goodnight, Mr. Gargery.
-Goodnight, Pip.
-Goodnight, sir.
Pip!
A young gentleman
of great expectations.
Biddy.
Pip!
This is a very gay figure, Pip.
I start for London tomorrow, Miss
Havisham, and I thought you wouId
-not mind my taking leave of you.
-Well?
I have come into such good fortune
since I saw you last and I am
so gratefuI for it.
I have seen Mr. Jaggers, Pip.
I have heard all about it.
-So you go tomorrow.
-Yes, Miss Havisham.
And you are adopted
by a rich person.
Not married?
No, Miss Havisham.
-And Mr. Jaggers is your guardian.
-Yes, Miss Havisham.
-Is Est...?
-Abroad.
Prettier than ever,
and admired by all who see her.
And you too have
a promising career before you.
-Be good, Pip, and deserve it.
-Yes, Miss Havisham.
You will aIways keep
the name of Pip, you know.
Yes, Miss Havisham.
Goodbye, Pip.
Well...
Goodbye, Joe.
God bless you, dear oId Pip.
God bless you.
-Goodbye, Biddy.
-Goodbye, Pip.
One day I'll come
and see you in London, Pip,
and then what larks, eh?
Goodbye.
Goodbye to you.
Hey, London.
Excuse me, please.
Is Mr. Jaggers at home?
He is not.
He's in court at present.
-Am I addressing Mr. Pip?
-Yes, I'm Mr. Pip.
Mr. Jaggers left word wouId you wait
in this room. Come this way, please.
He wouIdn't say how long he might
be, but it stands to reason,
his time being valuable,
he won't be longer than he can heIp.
Go and wait outside, Mike.
-I hope I'm not interrupting.
-CertainIy not.
-Your first time in London, Mr. Pip?
-Yes, sir.
I was new here once.
Rum to think of it now.
-Whose likeness is that?
-That?
This is our most famous client.
Got us a worId of credit.
This chap murdered his master
and didn't plan it badIy.
Is it like him?
Like him?
It is him, you know.
This cast was made in Newgate
directIy he was taken down.
Your man comes on this afternoon,
have you got the witness?
-Yes, Mr. Jaggers.
-Wait here.
-Mr. Pip's here.
-Good.
-So you arrived safeIy, Mr. Pip.
-Good morning, Mr. Jaggers.
Ah, we shall soon settle you.
Wemmick, Mr. Pip's file.
Wemmick here will conduct you
to Mr. Herbert Pocket's
rooms in Barnards Inn,
where you will live.
Oh, sit down, Mr. Pip, sit down.
Mr. Pocket will be able to give you
a good lead as to the places
in London with which
you shouId become acquainted.
-I take it that that is agreeable.
-Yes, Mr. Jaggers.
Ah, next, money.
Your allowance will be
250 pounds per annum.
Which means that you will
draw from Wemmick here
the sum of sixty-five pounds
ten shillings per quarter.
A very handsome sum
of money too, I think.
-Do you consider it so?
-How couId I do otherwise?
-Ah, but answer the question.
-UndoubtedIy, Mr. Jaggers.
Good.
Get out.
Here is a list of the tradespeople
with whom you may run up an account.
-Take Mr. Pip to Barnards Inn.
-Yes, sir.
I shall check the bills and pull you
up if I see you getting on too well.
Of course, you'll go wrong somehow,
but that's no fauIt of mine.
Goodbye and good luck, Mr. Pip.
-Thank you, sir.
-Mike!
Mr. Wemmick, I don't quite know
what to make of Mr. Jaggers.
He don't mean that you shouId
know what to make of him.
Deep, that's what he is.
As Australia.
-Who was that he shouted at?
-Oh, his housekeeper, name of Molly.
He got her off
on a murder charge.
Murder? Isn't he frightened
of having her about?
Not him. When you come to see us
again, take a good look at her.
Shall I see
anything very uncommon?
You'll see a wiId beast tamed.
Keep your eye on it.
Here we are.
Pocket's on the first floor.
-You don't want me any more?
-Er, no, thank you, Mr. Wemmick.
As I keep the cash, we shall
most likeIy meet pretty often.
Very glad, I'm sure,
to make your acquaintance.
-Good day.
-Good day, sir.
Mr. Pip?
Mr. Pocket?
I'm extremeIy sorry. But the fact
is I've been out on your account,
for I thought that coming from the
country, you might like some fruit.
-I went to Covent Garden to get it.
-Thank you. It's very nice of you.
Can I take the parceIs?
It sticks, you know.
Pray come in.
This is the sitting room.
Rather musty,
but Barnards is musty.
I'm afraid I'm rather bare here.
Now, that's my little bedroom.
And this is yours.
Come in.
-Oh, it's very nice.
-The furniture's specially hired.
-Oh, I hope...
-Dear me. I beg your pardon.
You are hoIding the fruit all
this time. I feeI quite ashamed.
You will be very quiet here and
we shall be along together,
but I dare say we shan't fight.
Fight! I knew I'd seen
you before. You are the Pale Young
Gentleman from Miss Havisham's.
Bless me.
And you are the Prowling Boy.
-The idea of it being you...
-Well, the idea of it being you.
I hope you'll forgive me for
having knocked you about so.
Oh, of course.
You hadn't come into your good
fortune at that time, had you?
I was rather on the lookout
for good fortune then.
Indeed?
If Miss Havisham had taken a liking
to me, I'd have been provided for.
Perhaps I shouId even
have been engaged to Estella.
But I didn't care much for it.
She's a Tartar.
-Who? Miss Havisham?
-I meant Estella.
You know she was adopted
and brought up
by Miss Havisham to wreak revenge
on all the male sex?
Wreak revenge on the male sex?
What revenge?
Heavens, Mr. Pip,
I thought you knew.
Dear me, it is quite a story,
-and it shall be saved till dinner.
-Shall I take your cane?
Thank you.
And your hat.
-Herbert?
-Yes, my dear Pip.
As I have been brought up
by a blacksmith,
I'd take it as
a great kindness if you'd
give me a hint when
I go wrong in my manners.
With pleasure, though I shouId guess
you need very few hints.
Thank you very much. Now
-tell me more of Miss Havisham.
-Ah, yes, Miss Havisham.
But let me point out the topic
that in London it is not the custom
to put the knife in the mouth
for fear of accidents.
It's scarceIy worth mentioning, onIy
it's as well to do as others do.
-I must apologise. Thank you.
-Not at all, I'm sure.
Now, Miss Havisham
was an heiress,
and, as you may well suppose,
was looked upon as a great match.
Well, one day there appeared
on the scene a certain man.
I never saw him for this
was twenty-five years ago.
But he pursued her closeIy and
professed to be devoted to her,
and there is no doubt that she
fell passionateIy in love with him.
Which brings me to
the crueI part of the story.
MereIy breaking off,
my dear Pip, to remark
that it is not considered necessary
to fill the mouth to its capacity.
-Sorry, thank you.
-Not at all, I'm sure.
The marriage day was arranged,
the wedding dresses were bought,
the wedding guests were invited.
The day came, but not
the bridegroom. He wrote a letter.
Which she received when she was
dressing for her wedding at 8.40?
ExactIy.
So that was why
she stopped the clocks.
And when she recovered from a bad
illness, she laid the place waste,
as you have seen it, and has never
since looked upon the light of day.
Herbert,
you said that
Estella was not related to
Miss Havisham but onIy adopted.
-When adopted?
-There has aIways been an Estella
since I have heard of
a Miss Havisham.
I know no more.
So Pip, all I know about
Miss Havisham, you know.
But let us change
to brighter prospects.
Let us drink to London
and a very happy future.
To London
and a very happy future.
Three, four...
All together, Mr. Pip.
That's right. That's better.
Much better.
Enjoy yourseIf.
Ready?
Ready.
Forgive me, Herbert.
Carry on, Pip, carry on.
And so if I couId buy some new
furniture and one or two other
things, I think I wouId be quite
at home at Barnards Inn.
I knew you'd get on.
How much do you want?
-Twenty pounds.
-Wemmick!
Well, Pip.
I shouId say
you were at home.
-Herbert?
-Yes?
-We have done very badIy.
-Very badIy.
Thank heaven for my birthday.
-Good morning, Mr. Pip.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Morning.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, Mr. Wemmick.
Come in.
-Mr. Pip, sir.
-Come in.
Twenty-one, eh, Pip?
I must call you Mr. Pip today.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, Mr. Jaggers.
Sit down.
Now, my young friend,
I'm going to have a word with you.
If you please, sir.
What do you suppose
you are living at the rate of?
At the rate of, Mr. Jaggers?
The rate of.
I'm... I'm afraid
I am unable to answer.
I thought so. But I have asked you
a question, my friend.
-Have you anything to ask me?
-Well...
It wouId be a great relief to ask
you severaI, were it not forbidden.
Ask one.
Is my benefactor
to be made known to me today?
No. Ask another.
Well, I...
I was just wondering if
I had anything to receive.
I thought we shouId
come to that. Wemmick!
Mr. Pip, you have been
spending pretty freeIy of late,
and you are in debt, of course.
I'm afraid I must say yes, sir.
You know you must
say yes, don't you?
-Yes, sir.
-Wemmy,
hand Mr. Pip that piece of paper.
Now, unfoId it
and tell me what it is.
It is a bank note
for 500 pounds.
That is a bank note for 500 pounds,
and at the rate of
that handsome sum per annum,
and at no higher rate,
you are to live untiI
your benefactor appears.
Will it... will it still be
years hence, Mr. Jaggers?
When that person discloses,
you and that person
will settle your own affairs.
My part of the business
will cease.
That is all I have to say.
Wemmick, show Mr. Pip out.
Thank you, Mr. Jaggers.
My dear Mr. Pip,
Mr. Gargery is going to London
and would be glad,
if you are agreeable,
to be allowed to see you.
He would call Tuesday morning
at nine o'clock.
We talk of you
in the kitchen every night
and wonder what
you are saying and doing.
No more, dear Mr. Pip,
from your ever obliged
and affectionate servant,
Biddy.
As l watched Joe
that Tuesday morning
grotesquely in a new suit,
let me confess
that if l could have kept him
away by paying money,
l certainly would have paid money.
ln trying to become a gentleman
l had succeeded
in becoming a snob.
Joe.
How are you, Joe?
Pip.
How are you, Pip?
Come in, Joe.
Well, Joe, I am glad to see you.
Pip, dear oId chap,
you've growed and you've swelled,
and you've gentlefoIked
as to be sure
you're an honour
to your king and country.
And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.
Give me you hat.
Herbert, This is Mr. Joe Gargery.
Joe, Mr. Herbert Pocket.
-How do you do, Mr. Gargery?
-Your servant, sir.
-Won't you sit down?
-Thank you kindIy, sir.
Will you take tea
or coffee, Mr. Gargery?
Oh, thank you kindIy, sir.
I'll take whichever is
most agreeable to yourseIf.
-What do you say to coffee?
-Thank you kindIy, sir.
Since you are so good as
to make choice of coffee,
I'll not run
contrary to your opinion,
but don't you find that
rather heating?
Take tea then.
Pip, if Mr. Gargery
will excuse me,
I will go down to the porter's lodge
and fetch the morning's letters.
Thank you kindIy, sir.
-Us two being now alone, sir...
-Joe, how can you call me sir?
Us two being now alone, Pip,
I will mention what has led to
my having the present honour.
Miss Havisham
has recentIy sent
-for me.
-Miss Havisham, Joe?
''WouId you tell
Mr. Pip,'' she says,
''that I wish to see him at once,
for I have something
most particular to disclose to him.''
I see.
Well, I have now
concluded, sir and Pip.
I wish you ever well
and ever prospering to a greater
and greater height.
But you are not going now, Joe?
Yes, I am.
Well, you will be
coming back for dinner?
Oh no, Pip, oId chap.
You and me is not two figures
to be together in London.
I'm wrong in these clothes, Pip.
I'm wrong out of the forge and out
of the kitchen, off the marshes.
-But Joe...
-You won't find haIf so much fauIt
with me if you think
of me as Joe the blacksmith.
So,
God bless you,
dear oId Pip, oId chap.
God bless you.
All that day
Joe's simple dignity
filled me with reproach.
And next morning l began
the journey to our town,
knowing that l should sleep
that night at the forge.
But as the miles went by,
l became less convinced of this,
and l invented reasons
and excuses for not doing so.
Joe, Pip's here.
Oh, we didn't expect you, Pip.
Pip, your bed's not ready.
We thought for certain
you'd be staying in the town.
You must stay in the town.
Gentlemen always stay
at the Blue Boar.
Blue Boar, Rochester.
All other swindlers upon earth
are nothing to the self-swindler.
And with such pretences
did l cheat myself.
Surely a curious thing.
Come in, Pip.
How do you do?
How do you do, Miss Havisham?
You kiss my hand
as if I were a queen.
Well?
I thought that you were so kind as
to wish to see me, Miss Havisham.
Well?
Estella!
Well, Pip.
This is an unexpected pleasure.
I did not think to find you here.
You two will have a lot
to say to each other.
Go out into the garden, both
of you, and waIk and taIk together.
I was a strange little creature to
hide and watch you fight that day.
But I did,
and I enjoyed it very much.
-You rewarded me very much.
-Did I?
Don't you remember?
I remember I entertained
a great objection to your opponent.
I took it ill that he shouId be
brought here to pester me.
He and I are great friends now.
I imagine that since
your change of fortune
you have naturally
changed your companions.
Oh, yes, naturally.
Do you remember
the first time I came here,
the time you made me cry?
Did I?
I don't remember.
Not remember you made me cry?
You meant nothing to me,
why shouId I remember?
You must know, Pip,
that I have no heart.
Perhaps that's why
I have no memory.
No-one looking at you
couId believe that.
Oh, I have a heart to be
stabbed at, or shot at, but
you know what I mean. There's no
sympathy, no softness, no sentiment.
If we are to be thrown much together
you had better believe that at once.
I cannot believe it, Estella.
Very well.
It's said, at any rate.
But remember how
I have been brought up and
don't expect too much of me.
Come, Pip.
You shall not shed tears
for my crueIty today.
We'll go just once more
round the garden and then go in.
Miss Havisham will be expecting
you at your oId post.
Is she beautifuI,
gracefuI, well-grown?
-Do you admire her, Pip?
-Everyone must who see her.
She is going to London soon
and you shall meet her there.
I shall be the happiest man
in London, Miss Havisham.
Love her.
If she favours you,
love her.
If she tears
your heart to pieces,
love her.
I adopted her to be loved.
I developed her into...
As punctuaI as ever, Jaggers.
As punctuaI as ever.
How do you do, Pip?
And what are you doing here?
Miss Havisham wished me
to see Estella, Mr. Jaggers.
A fine young lady.
Shall I give you
a ride, Miss Havisham?
Once round?
A very fine young lady, Pip.
-Estella!
-Pip!
How nice to see you, Estella.
My lesson from
Miss Havisham is this.
There are two Richmonds,
one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire.
Mine is the Surrey Richmond.
The distance is 10 miles and you are
to take me there. Here is my purse.
-No, no.
-No, you must take it.
We are not free to follow
our own devices, you and I.
The carriage is ordered
for haIf an hour from now
and tea is ordered
to while away that haIf hour.
-Does that please m'lady?
-The tea will please her greatIy.
Why are you going
to Richmond, Estella?
I am going to live,
at a great expense,
with a lady there who has
the power, or says she has,
of taking me about and introducing
me and showing people to me,
-and showing me to people.
-You will be much admired.
You must look forward
to that, Estella.
It is part of
Miss Havisham's plan for me, Pip.
I shall not take great pleasure in
events in which I do not shape,
but I will be beautifuI
and I will be gay,
and I will be obedient and
I will write regularIy of my gaiety.
Will you aIways be part
of Miss Havisham's plan, Estella?
And do you thrive
with Mr. Pocket, Pip?
Yes indeed.
We have left Barnards Inn
and moved to the Temple.
I live quite pleasantIy
there, at least...
At least?
As pleasantIy as
I couId anywhere
away from you.
All through that summer
l saw a great deal of Estella
and l was very happy.
Until l realised,
somewhat uncomfortably,
that she had many admirers.
lt was not until the winter
that fate threw her in the way...
of Bentley Drummel.
-Are you tired, Estella?
-Rather, Pip.
You shouId be.
Say rather
I shouId not be, Pip,
for I have my letter to write to
Miss Havisham before I go to bed.
Recounting tonight's triumph?
SureIy a very poor one, Estella.
I don't know what you mean.
I didn't know there had been any.
My lords, ladies and gentlemen...
This is our dance, Estella.
Pray take
your places for the next
dance.
Estella, look at DrummeI.
He never takes his eyes off you.
Why shouId I look at him?
Is there anything in DrummeI
that I need to look at?
That's the question
I want to ask you.
He has been hovering
about you for weeks.
Moths and all sorts of ugIy
creatures hover about a candle.
Can the candle heIp it?
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
pray take your partners
for the Spanish polka.
Everybody dislikes him,
you must know that.
There is nothing
to recommend him but money
and a ridiculous roll
of addle-headed ancestors.
It makes me wretched
to see you encourage him.
Does it?
You give him looks and smiles
such as you never give to me.
Do you want me then
to deceive and entrap you?
Do you deceive
and entrap him, Estella?
Yes, and many others.
All of them but you.
Who do you want?
Mr. Pip.
I am Mr. Pip.
What is your business?
My business?
Ah, yes...
I will explain my business
by your leave.
Do you...
Do you wish to come in?
Yes, I wish to come in, master.
Now perhaps you will
explain your visit?
It is disappointing to a man
after having looked forward
so distant
and come so far.
-But you are not to blame for that.
-What do you mean?
I will speak in haIf a minute,
give me haIf a minute, please.
There's no-one nigh, is there?
Why do you ask that question?
Oh, you're a game one.
I'm glad you growed up
to be a game one.
Now I know who you are.
The churchyard...
The churchyard on the marshes.
You are the convict
I gave the food to.
You acted nobIy, my boy,
noble Pip, and I never forgot it.
If you are gratefuI to me
for what I did when I was a chiId,
and if you have come
to thank me, there is no need.
However, since you
have found me out,
will you drink something
before you go?
Yes, I will drink,
I thank you.
Afore I go...
I hope you won't think
I spoke harshIy to you just now.
I had no intention of doing so
and I am sorry for it if I did.
I wish you well and happy.
How have you been living?
I have been a sheep farmer away in
the new worId, in New South Wales.
-I hope you have done well.
-I have done wonderfully well.
-I am very glad to hear it.
-I hoped to hear you say so.
You've done well too, eh?
Yes, I have done quite well.
May I make so boId as to ask
how you have done so well
since you and me were out on
those lone shivering marshes?
How?
Yes, I have been chosen
to succeed to some property.
May a mere varmint
ask what property?
I don't know.
May a mere varmint
ask whose property?
I don't know.
CouId I make a guess at your income
since you have come of age?
As to the first figure now... five?
Concerning a guardian...
There ought to have been a guardian
or such like while you were a minor.
Some lawyer maybe?
As to the first letter
of that lawyer's name, now...
WouId it be ''J''?
As the employer
of that lawyer whose name
began with ''J'',
and might be Jaggers...
I wrote to a person in London
for particulars of your address.
That person's name...
why... Wemmick!
Yes, Pip, dear boy,
I made a gentleman of you.
It's me what done it.
I swore as ever I earned a guinea,
that guinea shouId go to you.
That there hunted dog
what you kept life in
got his head so high he couId make
a gentleman. And Pip you're him.
Why, Pip, I'm your second father
and you are my son.
Look how good-looking
you've grown.
There's a pair
of bright eyes somewhere, eh?
Is there a pair of bright eyes
that you love the thought of?
They're yourn, dear boy,
if money can buy them.
But didn't you ever
think it might be me?
No... never.
Well, you see it
was me and single-handed.
Never a souI in it but
my own seIf and Mr. Jaggers.
-Was there no-one eIse?
-No. Who eIse shouId there be?
-Where are you going to put me?
-Put...?
Aye, to sleep.
Well, I...
Who is that?
Don't be alarmed. It's Mr. Pocket,
who shares these rooms with me.
Phew... what a night!
Hello!
Herbert, something...
something very strange has happened.
This is a visitor of mine.
Take it in your right hand.
Say ''Strike me dead on the spot
if I split in any way whatever.''
Strike me dead on the spot
if I split in any way whatever.
-Kiss it.
-Do as he says, Herbert.
Now you're on oath.
Come in.
You can go now, Molly.
Now, Pip, be carefuI.
I will, sir.
Don't commit yourseIf.
Don't commit anyone,
-you understand? Anyone.
-Mr. Jaggers, I...
Don't tell me anything. I don't
want to know. I'm not curious.
I mereIy want to assure myseIf
that what I have been toId is true.
Did you say toId or informed?
ToId wouId seen to impIy
verbaI communication.
You can't have verbaI communication
with a man in New South Wales.
I will say informed, sir.
Good.
I have been informed by
a person named AbeI Magwitch
that he is the benefactor
so long unknown to me.
That is the man...
in New South Wales.
-And onIy he?
-And onIy he.
I am not so unreasonable, sir,
as to think you at all responsible
for my mistakes
and wrong conclusions,
but I aIways supposed
it was Miss Havisham.
As you say, Pip, I am not
at all responsible for that.
And yet it looked
so like it, sir.
Not a particle of evidence, Pip.
Take nothing on its looks,
take everything on evidence.
There is no better rule.
Well, I have nothing more to say.
You shouId know I communicated to
AbeI Magwitch in New South Wales
reminding him that if ever he shouId
present himseIf in this country,
it wouId be an act of felony,
rendering him liable
to the extreme penaIty of the law.
Take a look out
of that window, Pip.
That sort of thing
happens every day.
Magwitch has enemies here who wouId
not hesitate to inform on him.
I see.
By he has guided himseIf
by my caution, no doubt.
No doubt.
If you will excuse me, sir.
There is no
other aIternative.
He has to be got out of the country
and I shall have to go with him.
-Why must you go with him?
-He has risked all on my account and
-I cannot do less than stand by him.
-What will you say to Estella?
I am at a loss to know
what to say to her.
She wouId never
understand about him.
But I must see her before I go.
-Ha! Just come down?
-Yes.
BeastIy place, your part
of the country, I think.
I am going out
for a ride in the saddle.
I mean to explore
these marshes for amusement.
Out-of-the-way villages
there, they tell me.
Curious little public houses
and smithies, and that.
Mr. DrummeI, I did not seek
this conversation
and I don't find it
a very agreeable one.
I'm sure you don't,
but don't lose your temper.
-Haven't you lost enough?
-What do you mean?
Look here, you sir.
The lady is joining me later,
so take her horse round
to her house in an hour's time.
Very good, sir.
And tell the waiter I don't dine
because I'm dining with the lady.
Aye, aye!
Come on.
And what wind
blows you here, Pip?
I went to Richmond yesterday
to speak to Estella,
and finding that some wind
had blown her here I followed.
What I have to say to Estella I will
say before you in a few minutes.
It will not surprise you,
it will not displease you.
I am as unhappy as you couId
ever have meant me to be.
I have found out
who my benefactor is.
It is not a fortunate discovery
and is not likeIy
ever to enrich me in reputation,
station, fortune, anything.
But there are reasons
why I must say no more than that.
It is not my secret but another's.
It is not your secret
but another's? Well?
When you first caused me to be
brought here, Miss Havisham,
I suppose I really came here as any
other chance boy might have come,
as a kind of servant to gratify a
want or whim and to be paid for it.
-Aye, Pip, I did.
-And Mr. Jaggers was...
Mr. Jaggers had
nothing to do with it.
His being my lawyer and the lawyer
of your patron is a coincidence.
He hoIds the same relation
towards numbers of people.
But when I fell into the mistake,
at least you led me on.
Yes,
-I let you go on.
-Was that kind?
Who am I for heaven's sake
that I shouId be kind?
Well, well, what eIse?
Estella.
I shouId have spoken sooner
but for my long mistake.
It led me to believe that Miss
Havisham meant us for one another.
I feIt I couId not tell you
of my reaI feelings
while you were not free
to choose for yourseIf.
Now I have to go away.
So I must say it before I go.
I love you, Estella.
I've loved you ever since
I first saw you in this house.
I have tried to warn you
not to love me
but you wouId not be warned.
You thought I didn't mean it.
Is it true that Bentley DrummeI
is in town here and pursuing you?
Quite true.
That you encourage him
and ride out with him
and that he dines
with you this very day?
Quite true.
But you cannot fling
yourseIf at such a man.
ShouId I rather fling
myseIf at you, Pip,
who wouId sense at once
that I bring nothing to you?
But you can't love him, Estella.
What have I aIways toId you?
Do you still think in spite of it
that I don't mean what I say?
Estella...
you...
you wouId never marry him?
Why not tell the truth.
I am going to be married to him.
Come, Pip.
Don't be afraid of my
being a blessing to him.
I shall not be that.
Here is my hand.
Let us part on that.
You will get me out of
your thoughts in a week.
What have I done?
What have I done?
If you mean what have you done to
me, Miss Havisham, let me answer.
Estella has been part of my
existence ever since
I first came here the common boy
whose heart she wounded even then.
She has been the embodiment of
every gracefuI fancy
my mind has ever known.
To the last hour of my life
she cannot choose but
to remain part of my character,
part of the little good
in me, part of the eviI.
But you may dismiss me
from your mind and conscience.
But Estella is a different case.
And if you can ever undo any scrap
of what you have done amiss
in keeping part
of her right from her,
it will be better to do that
than to bemoan the past
through a hundred years.
Late that evening
l left the room
with the long table
for the last time
and started on my way
back to London.
-Mr. Pip, I believe. Good morning.
-Good morning, Ben.
I have a note for you, sir.
The messenger who brought it
said it's urgent.
-Get me a cab off the stand, Ben.
-Yes, sir.
-Wemmick, what's the trouble?
-So you got my note then?
-Yes, I came straight here.
-What have you done to your hands?
Oh, it's nothing. I got them burnt.
Mr Wemmick, I'm very anxious...
Everything's
taken care of, Mr. Pip.
But first come in. You don't
object to an aged parent, I hope?
-Oh, no, no. I shall be delighted.
-This is Mr. Pip, Aged P.
And I wish
you couId hear his name.
Give him a nod, Mr. Pip,
that's what he likes.
You have made the acquaintance
of my son at his office, I expect.
-Yes.
-Nod away to him if you please.
Yes, yes.
I hear that my son is a wonderfuI
hand at his business, sir.
You are as proud of me
as punch, ain't you, Aged P?
There's a nod for you.
There's another one for you.
Now Mr. Pip and I
have business to discuss.
Come and sit down.
I want to offer an apology.
He isn't capable of many pleasures.
Just tip him a nod now and then
and he'll be as happy as a king.
I'm sure you'll appreciate I am most
anxious to know what has happened.
Of course. Now,
I heard by chance
yesterday morning that
an oId enemy of a certain convict
whose name we needn't mention
had got wind
of his being in England.
So I went to the Temple
and found Mr. Herbert.
and I toId him that if
he was aware of any such person,
whose name we needn't mention,
being about your chambers,
he'd better get him out of the way.
I aIso heard that you
were being watched.
-That I have been watched?
-Yes.
And might be watched again,
so he had better get him out of the
way while you were out of the way.
I see.
He wouId be greatIy
puzzled what to do.
He was, but I... we, have now moved
him to a house overlooking the river
down Limehouse way.
-I shouId like to join him at once.
-If you take my advice, Mr. Pip,
you will wait till after dark.
By which time, you see, we can
have those hands attended to.
-Good evening, ma'am.
-Good evening, sir.
Thank you, Mrs. Whimple. And you can
send up our suppers, if you will.
-Very good, sir.
-How is he?
I'm a heavy grubber,
dear boy. AIways was.
Are you sure you can reIy on
Wemmick's judgement and sources?
Aye, Wemmick knows.
He spoke to me of
a particular enemy of yours.
-Do you know who that might be?
-Aye.
That was the man you saw me fighting
with near the marshes, with a scar.
He turned informer on me
then to save his own skin.
And he'd do it again
to see me hanged.
But no sneaking rat like him's
going to make me leave my boy.
If you're worried about that there's
no need. I'm coming with you.
No!
You're a game 'un.
What a game 'un my boy's
turned out to be, eh?
The following day, l sent
Herbert to make some enquiries.
He found that the packet boat
for the continent
left Gravesend Pier
at high tide every Thursday.
l set myself to hire a boat.
lt was soon done.
l couldn't get rid of
the notion of being watched.
And how many undesigning persons
l suspected of watching me,
it would be hard to calculate.
l began to go out as for
training and practice,
sometimes alone,
sometimes with Herbert.
We were out in all weathers,
and became, as was our intention,
familiar figures on the river.
My burns were
still very painful.
We made it a practice that Herbert
should embark from
the place nearest to
the house where
our convict was hidden.
As the hours
of the tide changed,
we took to going
further downriver.
There,
on the marshes,
we found a lone public house
where we decided to stay
on the night of our escape.
And from a nearby buoy
we planned the passing
of the packet boat.
We chose this spot carefully.
lt was just above
the point where the steamer
picks up the river pilot.
The river pilot.
Our river pilot.
One day,
Herbert bought
two steamship tickets
and our plans were set.
Boat ahoy.
Ahoy there.
-Tell me something.
-What, dear boy?
What I did for you as a chiId
was such a small thing.
Why have you done
so much for me?
I had a chiId
of my own once, Pip.
A little girI
who I loved and lost.
What happened to her?
I don't know.
It's a dark part of my life,
dear boy. Ain't worth telling.
But when on those
lone shivering marshes
a boy was kind to
a haIf-starved convict,
that boy took the place
of the chiId he had lost.
A little on your left.
Here she comes!
One.
Two.
One.
Two.
You have an escaped convict there.
That's the man in the stern.
I call upon him to surrender
and you to assist.
I'll never
forgive myseIf for this.
I'm all right, dear boy.
I'm content to have seen
my boy and to take my chance.
Jaggers will heIp us,
he'll get out off all right.
Prisoners at the bar.
It is now my duty
to pronounce the sentence
demanded by the law.
The sentence of this court is
that you will be taken hence
to the place from whence you came
and from thence
to the place of execution.
And that each of you there
shall be hanged by the neck
untiI you are dead.
And may AImighty God have mercy
on your souIs.
Are you absoluteIy certain there is
nothing you can do to save him?
Nothing.
You realise of course that you
no longer inherit his money.
That will be claimed by the Crown.
The money is of
no interest to me.
If you had been a blood relation,
it might have been different,
but you are not a blood relation,
therefore it is not different.
You mean
if he had a chiId,
the money might go to the chiId?
The money might go to the chiId.
Mr. Jaggers,
there was a chiId.
-So you think there was chiId?
-I know there was a chiId
and what is more,
Mr. Jaggers, you know it.
Sit down, Pip.
I am going to put a case
to you, Pip, but I admit nothing.
I understand, you admit nothing.
Put the case that a woman
is charged with murder.
Put the case that
this woman has a chiId
whose father is a convict.
-I understand perfectIy.
-But that I make no admissions.
But that you
make no admissions.
Now, Pip,
put the case that
this woman's legaI advisor
knows an eccentric
and very rich lady
who is anxious
to adopt a little girI.
You understand, Pip?
I understand.
But I can hardIy believe.
Ring that bell, Mr. Pip.
-Yes, sir?
-Basin.
Yes, sir.
Well, Pip?
If I am in my right mind
and that woman
is Estella's mother,
this legaI advisor you mention
will have a lot to answer for.
Now, Pip.
Put the case of this legaI advisor
who has often seen chiIdren
tried at the criminaI bar.
Put the case that he has known them
to be habitually imprisoned, whipped
neglected, cast out, qualified
in all ways for the hangman,
and growing up to be hanged.
Put the case that here was
one pretty little chiId
out of the heap
that couId be saved.
Put the last case to yourseIf
very carefully, Pip.
I do, Mr. Jaggers.
Did he do right?
He did right.
Good.
Does Estella know?
You mean does
the little girI know?
Yes.
No, she does not know.
She must never be toId.
As to that she has a claim
to her father's property...
The legaI advisor
must use his own judgement.
Her father's condition
is considerabIy worse.
He has been moved
to the prison infirmary.
Dear boy.
I thought you wasn't coming,
yet I knew somehow
that you wouId.
It is just the time.
I waited at the gate
so as not to lose a moment of it.
God bless you.
You have never deserted me
and what is best of all,
you have been
more comfortable alonger me
since I was under a dark cloud
than when the sun shone.
That's the best of all.
Are you in pain?
I don't complain
of none, dear boy.
You never do complain.
You had better stay.
I have something to tell you.
Can you understand what I say?
You had a chiId once
who you loved and lost.
She lived
and found powerfuI friends.
She is living now.
She is a lady
and very beautifuI.
And I love her.
Oh Lord, be mercifuI to him...
a sinner.
Get out of the way,
you fooI!
Is it Joe?
Which it are, oId chap.
How long, Joe?
Which you mean to say, Pip?
How long have your illness lasted?
Yes, Joe.
Well, it's the end of ApriI, Pip.
Tomorrow's the first of May.
Dear Joe.
Have you been here
all the time?
Well, pretty nigh, oId chap.
Joe.
Where am I?
You're home.
I brought you home,
dear oId Pip, oId chap.
Oh, Joe!
You break my heart.
Please don't be so good to me.
Now lookee here, oId chap,
ever the best of friends.
You'll soon be well
enough to go out again.
And then, oh, what larks!
Biddy.
You have the best
husband in the worId.
-And Joe, you have the best wife.
-Which I know, Pip, oId chap.
You will be very happy.
-Which is our intention, oId chap.
-And you'll have chiIdren.
Which is aIso
our intention, Pip, oId chap.
One day, Pip,
you will marry too.
I don't think I shall, Biddy.
Not now.
Dear Pip.
Do you still fret for her?
I think of her.
But that poor dream,
Biddy, has all gone by.
All gone by.
l knew as l said these words
that l secretly intended to visit
the old house that evening.
-What name?
#Pumblechook.#
Quite right.
Come in, Pip.
l know nothing of days of the week
and nothing of weeks of the year.
Don't loiter, boy.
Come along, boy.
Take your hat off.
-Whom have we here?
#A boy.#
A boy of the neighbourhood, eh?
But he's a common labouring boy.
You can break his heart.
This door, boy.
Pip!
Estella!
Estella!
What are you doing here?
I thought you were
in Paris with your husband.
I have no husband, Pip.
-Have you not heard?
-I've been ill. I've heard nothing.
When Jaggers disclosed to
Bentley DrummeI my true parentage,
he no longer wished
to have me for a wife.
Well, Pip,
why don't you laugh?
You have every right.
I have no wish to laugh, Estella.
I am truIy sorry.
You've no need to pity me.
It simplifies my life.
There is now no need to sell the
house. It's mine and I'll live here.
I shall like it here, Pip.
Away from the worId
and all its complications.
Estella.
How long have you been here?
I don't know.
Estella, you must
leave this house.
It's a dead house.
Nothing can live here.
Leave it, Estella, I beg of you.
What do you mean?
This is the house where I grew up.
It's part of me.
-It's my home.
-It's Miss Havisham's home.
But she's gone. Gone from this
house, from you, from both of us.
She is not gone.
She is still here with me
in this room, in this very room.
Then I defy her.
I have come back,
Miss Havisham.
I have come back,
to let in the sunlight.
Look, Estella! Look!
Nothing but dust and decay.
I never ceased to love you even when
there seemed no hope for my love.
You are part of my existence,
part of myseIf.
Estella, come with me,
out into the sunlight.
Look at me.
Pip.
I'm afraid.
Look at me.
We belong to each other.
Let's start again.
Together.
Oh, Pip!
