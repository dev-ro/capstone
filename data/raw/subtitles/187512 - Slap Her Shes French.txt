Ed, where are you going?
What's the matter with you?
You know it, I've just realise that.
There is no place for me.
What are you talking about?
Why don't you go back
and get your reward?
I don't care about the competition
anymore..
That's not the Starla.
People can change.
Doreen.
What?
Come up here.
That slinky, sentimentaI
stealing my show?
I guess it doesn't matter.
You're right.
Let's get out.
Next faII I'm going to Wedsey CoIIege.
Without the scholarship.
Doreen thinks she can kick me
from sitting on the couch
With king curried.
She got another thing coming
I know there's room for everyone.
I told Randolph I was a vegetarian
He was surpassingly accept it
He told me he could for years.
That was the Iast moment.
It cool when you stopped being who you're
Supposed to be.
And start being who you really are.
Who'd ever thought I would get
up state New York Edwin.
To be the first person to take
me around the State.
Charles DeGauIIe Airport Paris, France.
Starla?
Bonjour you.
-The end-
