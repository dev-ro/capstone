Jacques, come quick!
- It's shining!
- Quick, Jacques! It's shining in the harbour!
Quick!
There! You see it, Jacques?
It's a coin.
- It's mine! I saw it first!
- No, you liar!
- Liar! Liar!
- We'll see who's lying!
OK, I'll get it, but no fighting. All right?
- We'll split it.
- You can't split a coin. It's stupid.
- It's mine! I saw it!
- He's right! You're stupid!
Then we'll buy something and split that.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK?
- OK.
- Can you stop pointing? I've seen it.
- I've seen it, too.
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!
How is the little Frenchman?
Fine.
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
No.
If you did mind, you'd tell me, no?
Yes.
Good.
Roberto, mio palmo!

Count!

One! Two!
Three!
Four!
Five! Six!
Bravo, Enzo! Bravo, Enzo!
Viva Italia! Bravo, Enzo!
Whose is it now?
You saw it, but I dove for it.
- Roberto, how long?
- Six!
I throw it back into the water.
You dive, and if you do less than six...
...it's yours.
Bravo.
Enzo, Enzo, I saw the coin first. We split?
We can't split a coin, stupido!
Jacques!
Is it... a coin shining there?
It is. It's a coin.
I'll get it for you, Father.
It will be for the poor.

Father!
Father!
Father!

Time to get up, Jacques.

Shit.
Enzo!
Jacques!
You shouldn't dive every day, Papa.
Then you shouldn't eat every day, Jacques.
Don't worry. When I am tired...
...the mermaids help me out.
Hey, have you ever seen a mermaid?
No.
I've seen them.
Don't you want to know where?
Why don't you ask me?
- What?
- Where I saw mermaids.
Why don't you ever ask any questions?
I always ask the questions.
Here we are, like two stones,
and now I'm talking to myself.
Ask me something, goddamn it!
Why did my mother leave?
Pump.
Your mother didn't leave.
She went back to America, that's all.
It's her home.
Women are like that.
Unpredictable.
Like the sea.


Jacques! The water! Water!
Help! I can't breathe!
No!

Daddy? Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Wait! Stay here, Jacques!
Jacques!
Daddy! Daddy!
Jacques!
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Jacques!
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
- Jacques!
- Daddy! Daddy!
Jacques!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy... Daddy...
Aiuto!
Aiuto! Aiuto!

Roberto, mio palmo.
Mr Molinari?
Yes! How did it happen?
Well, uh... the company asked me to
extract everything I could from the wreck.
And so the... the divers
were trying to get at the engine...
...and the boatjust turned over in the current!
Look, I... I fucked up!
Look!
Can you help?
How many are down there?
There's just one. We're feeding him lots of air
but... he's not breathing properly.
You've gotta get him outta there, fast!
Ten thousand.
Lire?
Dollars.

Hey, wait a minute!
You guys aren't gonna try to
hold me up at a time like this?!
OK, you tell me.
How much would you say
a man's life is worth?
In my village we have a saying.
How does it go again?
I don't remember.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Forget it.
Enzo!
Forza!
Since we have a little time,
you write that cheque?
How much longer can he do that?
My brother...
...is a world champion.
Sign.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo!
Thanks! Bravo!
Hey!
Wait! Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Wait! Hey!
Hey, thanks, you guys.
Really. I mean it.
You're welcome.

Forza Italia! Ten thousand dollars, Roberto!
Una barca di soldi!


Enzo...
What are you gonna do with the money?
Have the car painted.
But Giuseppe will do that for 25 dollars.
Then tell him to wax it, too.
Enzo, really, what are you gonna get?
A rosary for Mamma.
A dress for Angelica.
Get yourself a suit that fits.
But most important...
Yes?
Find me the Frenchman.
Find me Jacques Mayol.
El próximo paradero... es bien
el Lago del... Demonio?
EI... el Lago del... Demonio?


Bye.
Ooh!
A-Are you Dr Laurence?
No. I'm the assistant.
Welcome to Peru.
Thank you.
Agh!
A drink to warm up?
Yes, please.
- Tea or whiskey?
- Both.
Did... Did I just see a man
in a red suit and goggles?
Right.
The insurance person is here.
It's about time.
Johana Baker.
Nice trip, huh?
Thank you.
It's three weeks since the accident.
We're getting a little anxious.
Franck, get out there. He's ready to go in.
Right.
First dive, two minutes.
Who...
Who is that?
Mayol. Jacques Mayol.
So those are your experiments?
Dumping a guy in a frozen lake?
The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.
We weren't able to rescue the equipment.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
In the spring, when he melts.
You really send him under the ice?
He isn't a slave or a convict
or anything, is he?
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
- How is he gonna breathe?
- He isn't.

Listen.
That's the sound of his heart.
Can you hear the speed
at which it's slowing down?
It's incredible!
He's in the fluoroscope now.

Listen to his heartbeat!
I can't believe that!
All the blood is concentrated in his brain.
It doesn't even feed his limbs any more.
That's a phenomenon that's only
been observed in whales and dolphins.
Until now.


- 
- Why is he doing this?
I don't know.

Shouldn't someone take him
a blanket or something?
Coffee?
- I know you.
- We just met, a few minutes ago.
- In the lake?
- No... In the hut.
Then it must have been someone
who looked a lot like you.
Thanks.


It's a present.
Thank you.
You're not gonna open it?
Oh.
Are you here for a long time?
No.
Where do you live?
New York.
It's been nice meeting you.
Nice... meeting you, too.
I'll... I'll only be five minutes.




Clown.
- 
- It's a llama.


- Darjeeling.
- 

I missed you rascals.

Jacques, my friend.
How are you?
Enzo?
I leave you swimming
and 20 years later you're still in the water.
What the hell are you doing? Training?
Yeah.
Good.
Check out the suit. Looking good, no?
- You know I'm the world champion?
- Yeah, I know.
The world championship
starts in ten days in Taormina.
Be my guest.
Your ticket.
Why?
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
You're the best, Enzo.
See you there.
Come on, let's go, let's go!
Go park in Jersey, you asshole!
Come on, come on, come on!
I gotta get movin'! I gotta make a livin' here!

I changed the lock,
you son of a bitch!
Sally! It's me!
Where have you been?
Peru.
We were burgled.
They got the television set,
they got the new stereo...
...they got the ring my grandma gave me.
I hate New York.
I hate this apartment.
I hate you.
How was your trip?
It was nice. It was...
It was...
It was interesting.
It was cold.
You got a picture of him?
Matter of fact...
What... What the fuck is that?
It's his heartbeat.
I'm gonna make some coffee.
They left the stove!
He has the most beautiful eyes.
It's funny.
It's like a fairy tale.

You know, the French
are very romantic people.
He's not French. He's American.
His mother's American.
Haven't you been listening
to anything I said?
Yeah! I've been listening all night!
Sounds like you're in love.
But there's no such thing
as love at first sight.
You ate all the ice cream.

This is good! This is very good!
Very, very good.
Very good.
Unfortunately it's incomplete.
- Johana...
- What?
- Am I boring you?
- No!
Of course not.
Definitely not.
- What'd you say?
- I said that this file is incomplete. OK?
Go back to Laurence
and get the truck registration.
Don't let him tell you
it's in the glove compartment.
- The guy was really frozen?
- Like a Popsicle.
- They're keeping him on a stick till spring.
- Hah!
Glad I didn't go.
I... I can't hear you!
I said the snowmobile papers
are in the glove compartment.
Get the customs office to send me a copy.
We can't get you new equipment
until our file is complete.
All right. You'll have them
by the end of the week.
Great. You've made me a very happy
insurance person. Thank you.
- All right. Goodbye.
- Dr Laurence?
Yes?
Um... You don't happen to know how I can
get in touch with that diver of yours?
Jacques Mayol?
The last I heard he was in Taormina,
at the World Diving Championships.
In Sicily.
Sicily?
Duffy, we got big problems in Sicily!
- What do you mean?
- Oh, God-the Mafia!
Cosa Nostra, De Niro, Coppola, Pacino!
I knew we shouldn't have written that policy!
- What happened?
- The documents are forged.
- No!
- Yes! The notary is a phoney.
He's got the same signature as the contractor.
- Wait, that can't be true!
- Well, it is!
We must send someone immediately. If we
prove the forgery, maybe we're off the hook.
There's a plane in four hours to Rome.
From there, it's not far to Sicily.
- I'm calling Cordoza. He'll get us out of this.
- No! I called him.
- His son's bar mitzvah is tomorrow.
- Oh, damn his son!
- I'll go.
- You'd do that?!
- Yeah, I'll go.
- Oh, thank you!
I thought it was Spanish you spoke.
Italian's... practically the same thing.
Thanks a lot!

Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
- Are you sure?
- Positive, sir.
This is the Hotel San-Domenico?
Yes, it has been so for 127 years.


Be careful of that car.
It's a new paintjob. OK?
Contessa!
Avanti, avanti!
Ah! Jacques!
Giacomino, my friend!
My brother!
So, you finally decided to join us.
You did the right thing.
Paolo, come stai? C'è la chiave.
You remember my little brother Roberto?
- Hi.
- Hi, Roberto.
- What room have you got?
- I haven't got one.
You don't have a room? Paolo!
What did I just hear? I call you to reserve
a room for my friend Jacques Mayol...
...and you treat him like a stranger!
- It's OK, Enzo. I'll go somewhere else.
- Not only is he a very special friend.
But he is one of the best divers in the world.
And you sling him out!
Are you crazy or what?
Stupido!
Drop it, Enzo. I'll find something.

Take mine. I'll take the Countess's suite.
She told me she was leaving
for the cemetery.
She'll be more comfortable there! Ha!
I'm glad you're here.
So, after all these years, you must have
lots of questions to ask me. Am I right?
Yeah, sure, lots of questions.
Well, what are they?
I don't know how to ask the questions.
- Are you married?
-  No, no, no, no, no!
No.
Me neither. Because of my mother.
She's a curse, my mother. Tornado.
Stubborn as a mule. Ti ricorda, no?
I was engaged for a week. After, Mamma was
so mad, the pasta was bouncing off the walls!
So, not married.
Good for you.
You play the field, like me.
A girl in every port, huh?
- After all, we're men!
- Damn right!
That's what I tell them
when people say you've turned into a fish.
People say that?
Forget it! I was joking!
Ah! La Madonna!

I'll bet you my watch
that she's in my bed tonight.
Hello!

- You know each other?
- Yes!
- Enzo Molinari. This is a great pleasure.
- Johana Baker. Nice to meet you.
This is... a coincidence! It's unbelievable!
All the way out here!
It's incredible! I can't believe it!
Oh.
Uh... Would you like to sit down?
Yes. Thank you.
- I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
- No, not at all.
Emilio! Vieni qui!
- You staying at the hotel?
- It's full. But they recommended a pensione.
- All of Taormina is full.
- It's the Free Diving World Championship.
I am, by the way, world champion.
- What are you doing in Sicily?
- I was doing an insurance claim in Palermo...
...and decided to take a few days off,
see the island.
There is no place in the world
more beautiful than Sicily.
Spaghetti del mare
for the super-dedicated insurance agent.
Oh, no, no, no. Thank you. Just a coffee.
No, you should try it. It's good.
OK.
As I was saying earlier,
I am the world champion free diver.
Some people say it's
the most virile sport in the world.
One has to admit that seeing those men...
...diving headfirst in that deep blue sea,
all muscles contracted...
- Enzo...
- What?!
- Mamma?
- Dove?
Aspetta.
She'll kill me if she catches me
eating pasta in a restaurant.
Mangia, mangia. Mangia! Bullshit.
Eat!
Mamma!
Tu credi che io possa portare
da sola tutti questi bagagli?
Mamma... Roberto and an elevator.
Isn't that enough?
- Che cosa hai mangiato tu oggi?
- Coffee only.
I am diving tomorrow. Ah!
Remember little Jacques? Jacques Mayol?
His friend - Johana.
She is beautiful, no?
Spaghetti del mare!
Oh, thank you very much! Mm!
I'm so hungry!
Ha!
Mm, it's good.
Americana?
Benvenuta!
This is it.
It's... great!
So, you're gonna be
really busy these days, huh?
I don't know.
Why?
I... Because I...
I don't know. I just thought...
You have the competition, interviews.
A competition like this requires
a great deal of concentration... Doesn't it?
Yeah.
You can put down the bags now.
Thanks.
- 
- Jacques! Johana!
We have to get ready for the ceremony.
The Tahitian is the new world champion.
I'm tired. I don't feel like it.
Roberto, the jacket.
- This one?
- Yes.
Very good.
What about the shoes?
Very chic.
- Well, you don't have anything else, do you?
- No.
Then it's very chic. Avanti.
Hi.
Hi.
- 
- Ladies and gentlemen...
...your attention, please.
André Bonnet, president of the International
Diving Championship Committee...
E basta di mangiare!
...this trophy to the new world champion.
This afternoon, our new champion
descended to the remarkable depth...
...of 310 feet.
A one-day hero.
Mr President, if you please...
A new world record. That's great.
It gives me something to beat tomorrow.
- Have you ever been to Tahiti?
- No.
I'll take you there. We'll live in the sun.
You'll cook fresh fish...
...and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
Hey, wait. How about you do the cooking?
And... uh... you forgot the hula.
Excuse me.
He looks strange, doesn't he?
Like a baby who just learned to walk.
- Have you known him long?
- For ever.
We used to live on the same island in Greece,
when we were kids.
- What was he like when he was little?
- Little.
Very little.
That is, compared to me.
- I get it, Enzo. You were a superior child.
- Exactly.
What is it, Johana?
You are so crazy about him,
you don't see the truth?
Don't think of Jacques as a human being.
He is from another world.
And just what world are you from, Enzo?
Italia!
OK.
Italia.
And now, my friends...
...you are all invited for a drink
around the swim pool.
Today, at lunch, you asked me
if I had any questions.
Ah! You finally want to know about women!
- Are they what's most important?
- No.
It depends.
Sometime they are.
What exactly do you want to know?
Everything.
Everything about what?
About everything.
Mamma mia!

So, between Mamma, Roberto and Alfredo...
...we yell and scream all day long.
Except with Angelica. She just cries.
And then, finally, we all end up kissing.
Can you explain that to me?
Huh?
Because that's what love is all about.
It's a pain in the ass...
...but it keeps us together.
A large...
...and beautiful...

...family.

Enzo...
Yeah?
We've gotta quit this competition.
Why?
Cos... if we don't...
...l'm gonna beat you.

Do you hear that?

- What?
- He looks me in the eye...
...like some fucking goldfish...
...and says..."I'm gonna beat you."

That's what you guys are here for.
Ha! Listen to her!
That's what he's here for! 
He's here to lose! That's what he's here for.
First of all, I am unbeatable.
Second...
- How old are you?
- Two years younger than you.
As I said...
...second of all, you're too skinny.
You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand
how you can dive without getting sick.
The size of the lungs
has nothing to do with it.
The size of the lungs
has nothing to do with it.
How long can you hold your breath?
Longer than you.
Ah... We'll see.
- Come stai, Enzo!
- Figlio mio! Sono la madre!
Hey! Take it easy! Jesus!
What, are you nuts?

Come on, let me help you with this.
- Who won?
- What? The Asshole Award?
Let me tell you, it was a tie.
Acting like a pair of two-year-olds.
You could've died in that pool.

Stop moving. You're rocking the boat.
Luckily, I was there to save you.
My wallet.
- It's here.
- No, no. I wanna show you.
Give it to me.
Sit down.
That's my family.
What kind of man...
...has such a family?

It's OK.
It's all right.


- Enzo!
- Sì!
Avanti, avanti.
All the medics are looking for you, Enzo.
I am meditating! Can't you see?
Jacques does two hours of yoga
before going down!
I can have a five-minute nap!
Mr Molinari, I am sorry...
...but you cannot dive
in this state of exhaustion.
What do you know about the sea? Nothing!
So you just take your tubes
and your tin cans away.
The sea is mine.
I know when she is ready for me
and when she isn't.
And today she is ready.
Capisci?
You dive at your own risk.
Ah! Bravo.

One minute!
Three!
Two!
One!
Your pants are too big for me.
Where are they?

Thank you.
- Where is everybody?
- They're gone.
Something's wrong.
You can't do that.
What's the matter?
I don't understand.
I've tried for two days. They won't eat.
They won't perform.
Since we got a new one.

It's finished for today.
She's a new one.
How can you tell it's a female?

It's the way she moves.

Hey!
Jacques!

Help!
Porca miseria.
Jacques, help me!

Really...

Enzo! Enzo! Enzo!

-  Enzo!
- Ah... Jacques! Johana!
Don't be sad. I only took back what was mine.
Here. A present.
Tonight we're having a little party
among ourselves. Eight o'clock in my suite.

Mr Roberto, tell your brother
to be reasonable.
Everybody's waiting for him upstairs.
He can't! He's indisposed!
Shall we call a doctor?
No, no! La Mamma, she is trying something!

Oh, Mr Mayol, help us. He refuses to receive
his medal, and everybody's waiting for him.
- I'll do my best.
- That's very kind of you.
It's Jacques!
Jacques!
My friend! Come on in!
Mr Molinari, allow me to impress upon you...
...the importance of your attending
the award ceremony...
...for the press.
I think my brother told you I was indisposed.
That should do it, no?
I am allowed to be indisposed, right?
So you just go tell the press
that the big Enzo Molinari...
...overwhelmed by his inspiring descent
of 324 feet...
...will not be able to receive his trinket...
...because he is...
- Hm?
...he is...
Indisposed!
Bravi!
Jacques, my friend!
- Why don't you go pick up your medal?
- Ah, because pasta should be eaten al dente!
Let me know how you find it.
Duffy!
Yes, I'm here. I can hardly hear you.
Almost everything is... yeah.
Two... maybe three days.
But, um...
No, I'm in a restaurant. What?
OK, I'll call you back. I promise.
Tomorrow.
OK. OK.
Yes!
My office in New York.
It's really busy back there.
I have so much work to do.
Is it good?
- Do you want some?
- Oh, no.
Buon appetito, signorina.
Thank you.
Ah... Jacques!
What's the matter?
I have to ask you a favour.
Hey, we're not stealing a dolphin, eh?
No. I told you, we're just helping one out.
- Trying to help one out?
- Yes!
Good.
- Buona sera.
- Buona sera.


Taormina by night!
Lucky dolphin, eh?

Yeah! Stairs!




You can stop that now.
She has all the water she needs.
All right, we did it!
Let's go back to the party.

Jacques!

Five minutes, that's all! OK?
Well, then... Good night.
Night.
- Good night, Jacques.
- Good night.
You don't need a stretcher
to take her with you.
- You know that?
- What?
Dolphins aren't the only ones
who don't feel very good sometimes.
Jacques! Can I...
...come watch you dive tomorrow?
Yeah.
Good.
You really do have
a few things to learn about women.

What do those guys do?
They are paramedics.
They wait at 200 feet.
And him?
That is the diver who goes below 300 feet.
He dives with a helium-oxygen mixture.
Compressed air is too dangerous.
Three minutes!
