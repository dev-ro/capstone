Happy birthday,
Cristina.
Actually, it was

No alcohol.
I'm looking for someone.
Joseph, where did you
get those clothes?
Her name's Isabel.
They saw her.
I've come
to save her.
Joseph, did you
rob someone?
I had some luck.
Maybe God, you know?
God gave me this.
Joseph, I'm going
to call David,
my police
liaison officer.

This is
for you, sister.
You're okay.
Buy something nice
for yourself.

Sister Cristina.
Mother Superior:
So, do you know how much
is there?
£500.
A donation
is a donation.
I don't see
the quandary.
Cristina:
He's quite famous
among them.
They say he was
a commando.
He killed people
in Afghanistan.
That's what
soldiers do.
It doesn't mean
he's a thief.
Did he say where
he got the money from?
He said,
"Maybe God."
Anyway, what do you think
the police themselves
would do with it
if you handed it in?
They'd just share it out
and drink it in the pub.
or at Christmas,
get them all jumpers
or something.
Actually, he told me
to buy something for myself.
I thought perhaps maybe
I could use
just a small
proportion of it.
You see, there is something
I have been praying for.
You're a good and holy woman,
Sister Cristina.
If the money's
an answer to a prayer,
how can it be wrong?
Let me
put it this way.
I've not
written anything down
about this in the book.

Sister.
I'm afraid you're
too late for soup.
I'm not hungry.
I need medicine.
You're hurt?
I need antibiotics.
I'm not allowed
to dispense antibiotics.
But you do it for people
who can't get into the system.
- Go to emergency.
- I can't.
Why not?
If you don't want
to give your name,
just call yourself
Smith or something.
That would be
a mistake.
- Why?
- My name is Smith.
Jones, then.
Sister...
I'm on the run
from a court-martial.
I was in
a Special Forces unit.
There'll be
no forgiveness.
How do you know
it's antibiotics you need?
I've got two broken ribs.
There's an infection
around one of the breaks.
If it spreads
to the bone, I'll die.
I've been
wounded before.
If you drink alcohol
with these, they won't work.
I'll need
painkillers.
Give me something
with dihydrocodeine.
Yes, sir.
I've asked around
about your friend Isabel.
How'd you know
about Isabel?
Last night,
don't you remember?
Did I come here
last night?
Do something stupid?
You said you'd
had some luck.
"God," you said.
( cap clicking )
You don't believe?
So how do you explain
those new clothes?
I don't.
So what'd you find out
about Isabel?
She doesn't come
for food anymore.
If you see her,
give her this.
Tell her she
can come to me.
Tell her
she can be safe.
- Who lives here?
- Me.
- Did you break in?
- I fell.
Did you hurt someone?
Only myself.
Do you know the boys
say you're an angel?
Good night, Joseph.

I'm Damon's boyfriend.
One of 'em.
He said I could use his flat
while he was away.
Are you a model?
Sometimes.
Woman:
He didn't say anyone
was gonna be staying.
Do you have his number
in New York?
No, he keeps
himself very private.
Pity, you could've
called him.
Do you have a number?
He doesn't give it
to me.
In case I call him
late at night.
- I'm Tracy.
- Joey.
Joey Jones.
Damon said I should stay here
for the summer,
get my life
back together.
So that's what
I'm gonna do.

You're gonna

Who are you,

Fuck me if he ain't.

your tit.
- That's right, mate.

Hey, don't fucking
touch my boy!

Fucking leave it,

He's a fucking soft,

Come on, then!

Fucking get him!

Now you've missed
your train.
Huh?
- You wanna work?

You know what

They say you want
a driver.
I got a lot
of businesses.
They say you're
a hard man.
It's a hard city.

Um, give me

- Gray?
Yeah.
- Is it a dog?
- No.
Um, could it eat me?
Probably.
Right, so,
how many legs has it got?
- Two.
- You said four.
Are you tricking me?
I hear he wants
to see me.

What the fuck?
New rules.

45 Margheritas,
45 garlic breads,
45 Coke Zeroes,
45 chicken dippers,
and 45 coleslaws.
There must be

It's paid for

Okay, it's not
a mistake.
Who wants pizza?
- ( speaking in

Joey:
Tell your boss
in fifteen minutes
to have Mr. Choy's
envelope ready.
Also, I wanna order
takeaway for delivery.
It's very nice,
but I've no idea what it is.
I think
it's probably duck.
And there's fish
and chicken and pancakes.
- And this is from Crazy Joe
the angel, yeah?
- Next?
( girl screaming )
( doors open, slam )
Just drive, man.
Just fucking drive.
( tires screech )
( girl screaming )
That's his little sister.
She won't talk.
( screaming continues )
Dawn?
It's me.
Joe.
Nice suit.
Me and your daughter
live on £25 a week.
Since I lost my job,
I've been paying the landlord
with blowjobs.
What have you been doing
while they cut everything, Joey?
I've been fighting.
There's more
where this came from.
Lots more.
( door opens,
signal beeps )
( sighs )
- ( siren wailing )
- ( bell ringing )
Joey:
You got my invitation.
Wasn't sure
you'd come.
Buying food for the boys,
it's okay,
but not this.
Giving me things puts me
in a very difficult position.
You're not vegetarian,
are ya?
Why are you lighting fires
on the pavement?
My Chinese boss
sends his people here
to buy meat
for his restaurants.
I get three hours
hanging out on the street
doing nothing.
So tonight I decided
to have a barbecue.
- ( cork pops )
- You used to feed me.
Tonight, I feed you.
This is a very strange
thing to be doing.
I miss the smell
of woodsmoke.
I'm guessing that you have
psychological problems.
They put me
up a mountain
and told me
to kill people.
What'd they think would
come back down the mountain?
Joseph, I came here
because I might
have some news...
about Isabel.
They found a girl.
Last night,
my police liaison
officer
gave me
this photograph.
She was found
in the river.
They need help
with identification.
( spatula scrapes )
( sighs )
She was from the north,
that's all I know.
Did you love her?
We shared a box.
We'd just keep
each other warm.
Will you talk
to the police?
Fuck the police.
Joseph, I'm really sorry
to bring such awful news.
Where in the river?
The city, near
to Canary Wharf.
One of those
rich guys.
Yes, they think she
was killed by a client.
- The police give a shit?
- Of course they do.
David is a good man.
Really?
He's a "good man."
Good, good.
Good for him.
- Good.
- ( knife scraping )
- ( yells )
- In the fucking river!
If you dare to be angry
about Isabel...
you're a hypocrite.
I've asked around
about your job
for the Chinese boss.
They say, "Crazy Joey
deals drugs."
I just deliver the stuff.
I don't touch the stuff.
The autopsy said Isabel
"touched the stuff."
Maybe stuff
you delivered.
You don't put those things
together in your head.
You know why she
ended up in the river?
Because that's what
the river's for.
To wash away girls when
they're finished with them.
I see what's happening
in this fucking city.
How many people
you feed these days, huh?
You give them soup.
They want
their lives back!
Joey, when you were
out of your head on drugs
a few months ago,
you gave me some money.
I've spent it on
something for myself.
I haven't been able
to sleep properly since.
I-- I called
my sister in Warsaw.
She sold some of
the possessions
I left behind.
I don't need this.
I'm really sorry
about Isabel.
I know you
cared for her,
but think about
all the other Isabels.
Start to do
the right thing.
It is honest money.
I cleaned it for you.
Use it to start
an honest life.
I want you
to have this.
I'm gonna do a lot
of good things
this summer.
Give people
what they want.
I thought you might
want a dress.
Joey, I'm a nun.
I used to wear
a uniform.
Don't mean a thing,
you just take it off.
If it looks
beautiful on you,
then God would say
it's okay, wouldn't He?
I will put it in
the bag of clothes
for Africa.

Go on, Joey.
Show 'em. Show 'em!

Who killed Isabel?
I don't know.
( groans )
You're only alive
because I need information.
An eye for an eye.
You tell me
what happened to her,
or I'll kill you
with this spoon.
Some guy used to
rent her regular.
Beat her up.
He used to ask
for her.
He went too far.
Name.
We don't use names.
Describe him to me.
- Ah!
- Describe him to me.
He was about 30,
city boy,
scar over his eye.
That's all I know.
You get any trouble
from these two again,
you tell
Crazy Joe, okay?
( children chattering )
( switch clicks )
Jesus.
( music playing softly )
Fuck.
You look--
Your note said
you had information
for the police
about Isabel's killer.
That is the only reason
I am here.
And I put on
this dress because
it is the only dress
I have.
And don't think I won't
send it to Africa,
because I will.
They think my name's Damon,
by the way.
Please don't remind me.
- I think I might faint.
- What?
I haven't eaten
anything all day...
worrying whether
or not I would come.
Also, I didn't realize
there would be
so many naked men.
( gasps )
Look, I arranged
to meet you here
because I thought
you might like the
photographs.
I didn't realize
there'd be photographs
of men's... penises.
Sorry.
Joey, actually,
I do like photographs.
I take photographs--
usually of nature.
Penises are nature,
I suppose.
Yes, I suppose they are.
So what'd
you tell the mother?
I lied, I lied,
I lied.
So what information
do you have?
Tell your policeman
to look for a guy
around 30.
He has a scar
above his eye.
Works in the city.
Should I
write this down?
That's all I have.
Okay...
30 years old,
scar above his eye,
works in the city.
Got it.
We haven't been
introduced.
I'm Karl.
What's your name?
Just looking around.
I'm told the invitation
you handed in at the desk
was addressed
to Damon Coldfield.
I happen to be Damon's
photographic agent.
He's in New York.
Who the hell are you?
( speaking Polish )
I think you're
a bit drunk.
Yes.
I'm having
a crazy patch.
Starting when
I bought the ticket.
What ticket?
I used your money to buy
a ticket to a ballet.
That's a pretty
wicked thing to do.
( chuckles )
But, you see...
I've loved her
since I was a little girl.
Loved who?
Maria Zielinska.
She's 42
and still dancing.
She is who I always
wanted to be.
She is who
I should have been.
( speaking Polish )
I'm in a silk dress
in an alleyway...
with a gangster.
- Whoa!
- Oop!
And I'm drunk.
Are you still
a gangster, Joey,
or did I change you?
Just having
a crazy patch, too.
There are things
that I have to do.
When the summer's over,
I'll stop.
Because of me, yes?
I have to think
I'm doing good.
Your excuse for wearing
a pretty dress.
When does Damon return?
October the first.
( scoffs )
Then it's fate.
What is?
When I say
it's fate...
I should really say
it's God, but I don't.
You know why?
Because I'm not so sure
that God is there anymore.
That's the truth.
( speaking Polish )
I think I'm going
to throw up.
Oh.
No, I'm fine.
Sister,
I'm Catholic.
I'm not your sister.
I'm drunk and I'm
up against the wall.

Joey...
H-how are things?
Things are okay.
Have you heard
from Damon?
Yeah, he's okay.
You seem
so together now.
I'm really
together now.
You're like
a different person.
So, Joey...
are you
exclusively gay?
You know,
it's interesting...
recently...
I've found myself
attracted to...
nuns.
( car engine starts )

Who the fuck are you?
You owe
Mr. Choy money.
What the fuck do you know
about Mr. Choy?
Joey:
He's my boss.
What are you
talking about?
Mr. Choy only
employ Chinese.
Tell Mr. Choy
I'll send him a check.

I'm taking the cash.

Give me
the fucking cash.

Is there a problem?
You are scaring my clients.
We're looking

Calls himself
Joey Jones.
( helicopter blades

We've been told
he used to come down here.
They said you'd know
where to find him.
( church bell ringing )
Let me help ya.
What are you
doing here?
I just lied
to the police.
You haven't
changed at all.
If I could
do something else,
I would do it.
What did
the policeman say
when you gave him
the description?
He laughed at me.
He said it was
"too vague."
He said, "Tell
Joey Jones to come
and speak
to us himself."
You mean they
can't be bothered
to fucking look
'cause she was
a whore.
The truth is...
the police
are more interested
in finding out
more about you.
You're becoming
famous, Joey.
And Isabel
isn't famous?
You really are
a hypocrite.
You beat Taxman so bad
he's still in hospital.
You're not
just an angel,
you're God Almighty
dispensing justice.
Yeah, well,
I believe in justice.
Sometimes you have to
make it happen yourself.
I'm not the only
hypocrite here.
Want a kiss?
( door opens )
- Sorry.
- Get out of my car.
It's a van.
I suppose you think
it was very funny
that I got drunk.
I've been drunk myself
on occasion.
What exactly happened?
You don't remember?
It's all a blur.
You asked me to kiss you,
so I kissed you.
( sighs )
You didn't have
to kiss me
just because
I asked.
I wanted to.
Why did you want to?
That's a really
stupid question.
Look in the mirror.
It's not my fault
that I'm fucked up.
For a nun, your language
is pretty bad.
So whose fault is it?
He was my
gymnastics instructor.
It was in Warsaw.
It was my father
who made me do
gymnastics.
I wanted to be
a ballerina,
but he said no.
Cristina:
If I had become
a ballerina,
it wouldn't
have happened.
My instructor
began to...
( shudders )
He began to do it
when I was 10 years old.
He did it 17 times.
It was going to be
the 18th time.
For a very long time,
I believed I belonged in hell.
Because I was
so young...
they decided not
to send me to prison.
Instead, they sent me
to a convent.
Joey, I...
I have never told this
to anyone before.
Want me to drive?
I want someone
to drive.
( door signal beeps )
Cristina:
Here will be fine.
( engine stops )
How will you
get home?
I'm a gangster.
I'll steal a car.
I'll walk.
It's a lovely
morning.
( sighs )
Cristina,
in the end,
I just took off
my uniform and ran.
And look
what happened to you.
Sister Cristina,
I am deeply shocked.
You filled in
the Africa application.
My preference is
for the Valley Mission
in Sierra Leone.
But what about
your work here
at the Soho Mission?
Africa was always
part of my life plan.
Yes, in two years.
I want permission
to move it forward.
But why?
I am finding there are
too many distractions
here in London.
You're blushing.
It's very warm
in here.
It's even warmer
in Sierra Leone.
Hot, even.
I will wear a hat.
You have applied
to leave in this quarter.
I am ready to leave any time
after October the first.
( car siren passes )
Joey, they said you wanted
to speak to the boss.
Come with me.
( speaking Chinese )
Sit.
Madame, you know
everything that happens
in your back garden.
( speaking Chinese )
If a man pays for girls
and he's violent,
he soon becomes famous.
( speaking Chinese )
We refuse to deal
with them.
The Russians will
just charge double.
I understand you have
a blacklist of violent men.
Joey:
I'm looking
for a very violent man
who attacks girls.
He's young.
Around 30.
And he has a scar
above his eye.
He wears
very expensive suits.
We know him.
The description
is not too vague for you?
We have a business
to protect.
Madame,
would you be able to
find out the name
of this man?
Hmm.
( drawer opens )
( speaks Chinese )
A favor for a favor.
( air horn blasting,
gulls squawking )
( speaking Chinese )
( men coughing )
( clicking )
( voices whispering,
crying )
( thunder rumbles )
- Did they tell you?
- Tell me what?
They didn't
tell you.
( cries )
No, no, stop!
- Ah!
- They didn't
tell you.
( groaning, sobbing )
( glass breaking )
( man grunting )
Stop.
( slapping,
yelping within )
( horn honks )
58.
Some of them
are kids.
And some of them
are girls.
You want one?
I also asked
for information.
It's coming, okay?
( speaking Chinese )
It's the latest.
Do you know how to work it?
Yes, of course.
You could afford to get
a professional to do this.
Yeah, but I wanted you.
So who are
the photographs for?
My daughter.
You have a daughter?
Nine years old.
I came here with her once
when she was small.
She might remember.
I want her to have
some photographs of me
looking like
a normal man.
What do you think?
Like this?
( laughs )
Smile.
Why?
Okay, actually,
you look okay.
Do I look like
a good man?
What do you mean?
I want her to think
I'm a good man.
Yes, you look like
a good man.
So take a picture.
( shutter clicks )
Did your daughter
ask for photos?
No, but
when she's older,
I want her to have something
to remind her of me.
You won't see her?
I don't think I'll look
like this for much longer.
Why not?
Why shouldn't you
stay like this?
Just take a picture.
( dog whining )
You should have
one like this.
More natural.
The businessman drinking
his morning coffee.
Such a successful man.
So rich.
- Charitable.
- Of course.
She will be
very proud of you.
Enough.
I said enough.
At last a laugh.
There.
I am changing you.
Send those ones to me.
I'll take them with me
to Africa.
You're going to Africa?
A valley in Sierra Leone
where there is no water.
When do you leave?
Tomorrow.
So this is the end
of my crazy patch, Joey.
And I've decided
I want to end it with you.

Hello?
Who's there?
( Cristina laughing )
- ( clicking within )
- Hello?
( buzzes )
Joey:
Cristina!
Who the bloody
hell are you?
I don't know who you are,
but open this door.
( buzzes )
Did you hear me?
I said open the door.
- ( doorbell buzzes )
- ( pounding on door )
( laughs )
Cristina.
There's enough money in here
to get us away.
We could go anywhere
in the world.
No, Joey...
if you want to be
a good man,
be a good man.
Joey, will you come with me
to the ballet tonight?
I have a box.
There is room for two.
Tonight at 7:00.
Cristina:
My time here
at this mission
has been
a fulfilling time.
Surprises
all along the way.
Our mission has had
some failures.
Some tragedies...
the poor girl Isabel.
But we have also
had successes.
And we have also
had some who,
in spite of how
it may appear,
give us
reason to hope.
( knocking on door )
Who are you?
I've got something
for your mother.
And something
for you.
Can I just hold your hand
for a minute?
Dawn:
Ruby, who is it?
You be good, okay?
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,
and the farewell performance
of Maria Zielinska.
Announcer:
Tonight's performance
will begin in five minutes.
Please take your seats.
Elevator announcer:
Closing doors.
Absolutely, no.
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,
Maria Zielinska.
Max?
Max Forrester?
Yes.
Who are you?
How was your bonus
this year? Was it good?
It was very good.
Are you from Cisco
or American Eagle?
No. I'm from down there.
Listen, can I talk to you
for a minute?
I was actually
just getting some drinks.
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
Let me think...
- ( glass shatters )
- Oof!
( gasping )
What the--
what the hell do you want?
I think you should know
how it feels to be down there.
What?
( whimpers )
( screaming )
- ( gunshot pops )
- ( screaming )
Woman on radio:
A reported fatality.
Paramedics are on the scene.
Man on radio:

or thrown from the roof.

( sirens wailing )
( audience applauding )
( church bell ringing )
What are you doing here?
I'm waiting
for Maria Zielinska.
There was a party
after the show.
I want to see her
walk to her car.
Let me explain.
When I'm sober...
when I'm healthy
and well...
I hurt people.
I'm lethal.
I drink to weaken
the machine they made.
I've finished the work
I had to do.
And already, look.
You see 'em?
Hummingbirds.
( hummingbird wings
fluttering )
Hummingbirds were there
that day.
( pilot's voice echoes )
Do you copy?
Surveillance drones
saw what happened.
Man on radio: Roger that.
Hummingbird can see it.
He's got a weapon...
He's shooting up
in the air right now..
( yelling
in native language )
Please, please!
( screaming )
( choking )
The enemy killed
five of ours...
so I killed
five of theirs.
The first five
I could find.
I left the father
hanging.
( gunfire )
( woman screams )
( screaming )
( shouting
in native language )
( screaming fades )
( footsteps approaching )
You see her?
She is my witness.
( car door closes )
Sister.
Joey's voice:
"Dear Cristina,
I just wanted to say thank you
for taking the photographs.
Considering it's me
in the pictures,
they turned out
pretty well.
I gave all the best ones
to my daughter,
so you're left
with the ugly ones
and the scary ones.
Sorry.
I've sent Damon the money
I took from his account
and added some extra
for rent.
I left the boys at the mission
some cash for pizzas.
And I sent details
of the people smugglers
to the police.
I also rid the city
of a bad man.
I know that doesn't
make me a good man,
but I tried to do
the right thing.
Now I'll go back to the street
and disappear.
I was alive again
for one summer.
I'm glad I spent it
with you.
I hope Africa
treats you well.
All my love,
Joseph Smith."

Take him.
