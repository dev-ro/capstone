Every Sunday,
my father had the camera out.
He loved to tape us.
You've been shooting all day.
Do you wanna give it a rest?
It's Sunday,
you know the rules.
You know,
he's unconscious immediately.
I don't think
he suffered that much.
How do you feel about it?
Yeah, I haven't seen him
in so long.
That made it a little easier.
Dad.
Dad. Dad, look at me.
Why do you think
he stayed away?
You know why.
My mom leaving him,
him running for office.
You know,
he was ashamed of me.
It's just he was a great man...
and he expected a lot
from his son.
When they told me
he killed himself,
I think--I think it's because
I was getting released.
No, you don't know that.
You know, it's no wonder that
he wound up hating me.
You know, one day,
you're gonna have
to take him off
the pedestal, Tom.
You've come far, my friend.
It's clear to me
that he loved you
even if he didn't
wanna face you.
He left you everything,
gave you a second chance
so you can start over,
live your life,
make up for lost time.
Now, just remember,
rule your fear.
Don't let it rule you.
And when in doubt?
Trust my brain,
-not my eyes.
-There you go.
I've discharged Mr. Walker.
Please release him
to his parole officer.
Good luck to you.
I know it's been 20 years,
but you got to remember
your own home.
There,
your constant companion
for the next 30 days
of house arrest.
Impact-resistant, waterproof.
It'll warn you if you
start to stray. Come on.
- Jeez.
- Uh-hmm.
Wait, what does this do?
You got to be shitting me.
Okay. The tour is over,
because if I find out
you have a bowling alley
in the basement,
I'm gonna shoot you.
I need you to direct
your attention
towards this marvel
of modern technology.
It'll ring once or twice a day,
could be 9:00 in the morning,
could be midnight,
pick it up
before it rings ten times.
Stand in front of it,
smile, because that camera
needs to take your picture.
One more thing.
Fill it.
Idiots.
Your parents had no idea
what they were getting into.
I swear,
the only way I'm going back
down the aisle is in a box.
Oh, bad luck.
Your father's suicide
just days before your release.
Shut up.
Brody?
When my dad died,
what did they do with his dog?
He was put down Thursday.
How'd you know he had one?
Oh, he always
kept a Doberman.
He prided himself on how well
they were trained.
One bit me...
when I was little.
I wasn't supposed to pet him
when he was eating.
Never get between a dog
and his dinner.
Your father proved that
loud and clear.
Hey, what does that mean?
It was days
before we found him.
It wasn't a pretty sight.
You feeling okay?
-Oh, yeah.
Give me these.
What is this?
-Look, that's--
That's my problem, okay?
Not yours.
Come here.
Come here. Come here.
Come on, don't be shy.
You and me,
we're gonna be friends.
Look...
for the next 30 days,
you're mine.
If you screw up
in even the slightest way,
you're going straight back
to the institute.
A perimeter breach,
missed phone call,
someone else in the house, oh,
any sign that you're losing it,
anything, boom.
Because after what you
and your brother did,
there is nothing
I'd like more than to make sure
you never get to swim
in that pool...
-again.
-Okay.
Everyone in life
either wears a collar
or holds a leash.
Guess where that puts me.
No, I'm never going back
to that place.
Never.
That's the spirit.
I'll be checking in.
Well, when can I expect you?
Whenever I feel like
showing up.
It's your favorite.

Thank you. You may hang up.
Oh, yes.
Twenty years, baby,
I never stopped loving you.
Oh.
Oh, come on.

Delivery for Tom Walker.
Oh, hey, can you grab
those bags for me?
Sorry, I'm alone in the house,
and I can't really--
Oh.
"Oh" what?
What?
What?
You just said "Oh".
Uh, oh?
You're supposed to say
something afterwards?
-Yeah. One of the things that--
Crap, I'm sorry.
If I take one step
outside the house,
this thing will call the cops,
so I just--
I just want my groceries.
I can see why,
Mr. Badass.
You got five kinds of cereal,
four kinds of ice cream,
and every snack cake
in the Hostess spectrum.
You're off your diet?
Or you're just incredibly high?
I can't figure it out.
I just haven't...
been able to eat that
stuff in a really long time.
What are you listening to?
That's "Lump" by the Presidents
of the United States of America.
God, it sounds...
old.
I'm just not really that...
up on current music.
Yeah. No shit.
I guess
this is kind of awkward,
but I heard about your dad
passing away,
and I just wanna say I'm sorry.
You don't have
any family members
that could move in
and help you out?
Nope.
Well, what about your mom?
I'm not supposed to...
let anyone in the house,
I'm sorry.
You might as well spill,
because whatever
you don't tell me,
Wikipedia will anyway.
Who's Wikipedia?
Look, my mom left my dad
when I was 15,
and I never heard
from her again.
Why are you asking me
all of these questions?
Because you're weird...
and interesting.
And trust me,
nobody's interesting out here.
It's like a cultural wasteland.
Then why don't you just leave?
Well, you know, I'm...
kind of stuck at the moment,
working at the market and--shit,
the market.
Wait, the groceries.
BRB.
Something...
tells me you still got
a CD player.
Am I right?
Groceries, CD.
"Gray"?
Yeah. I like to...
label my mixes
according to the color I feel.
It's like a mood ring thing.
Okay.
It was nice getting
to know you and stuff.
Okay.
Wait,
what's your name?
Lynn.
Lynn.
Okay.
If this is gray...
what's black?
Hey. Hey, Lynn,
I, uh, just had...
a little free time
on my hands and I...
made you something.
Yeah.
Girls like art.
Red Pepper Market.
That's creepy.
No, that's, no,
that's just too creepy.
Yeah. Think I'm some
kind of weirdo.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
too many, Tom, too many.
How many years have Mommy
and Daddy been married?
Right.
How many candles do you have
on the cake already?
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.
Ten.
Is that so, huh?
Yeah, well, my mistake,
I guess.
What day...

Who is this?
Sorry,

Rats?
What the hell is this?
They're all your fears.
They're all your fears.
What?
Hello?
Who is it?
Who's there?
Dad?
: Hello?
-Oh, hey. It's me.
Yeah, it's Tom.
Did you screw up?
What? No.
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I just--I just, you know,
I haven't been alone
like this in...
20 years.
Hey.
Hey, thanks for coming.
Don't leave the door open.
Were you raised in a barn?
Yeah, sorry.
You weren't in the middle
of anything, were you?
Like what?
What
Unfortunately,
you're the only man in my life.
Well, unless you count
my deadbeat ex-husband.
-You sound as--
Wait, did you hear that?
Did you hear that creak?
Yeah, I did.
There's something I hoped
I'd never have to tell you.
What?
It's your father.
He doesn't want you here.
You're a nut bag.
This is a big house.
They creak, make noise.
Trust me.
The only person haunting
this place is you.
When was the last time
you had a drink?
Never.
Never?
This will help you.
Okay.
Don't I have to take
a urine test
-No, that's my discretion.
You take them when I say so.
You're gonna be okay.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, God.
That's got to be
an acquired taste.
You feeling better?
A little bit, yeah.
Okay.
Hey, thanks for coming over.
You're, like,
you're a lot nicer
than I thought.
Yeah.
In all kinds of ways,
it's just...
Okay. I'm--
just--
I'm sorry.
I thought--I thought
you wanted this?
What?
Oh, go ahead.
Yeah, laugh.
-No.
-No, no. Go ahead, laugh.
-No. No, no.
-Yeah, go on. Go on.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Laugh, rich boy.
Go ahead, you son of a...
You drag me out here
in the middle of the night
and go cold fish on me
and then you have the nerve
to pity me?
Why'd you get me out here, boy?
Why
Because you're afraid
of the dark, huh
Oh, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, I need my pills.
I own you, bitch.
Please, no, don't take my pills.
Maybe when your demons start
coming out of the woodwork,
you won't play so hard to get.
Please.
Oh.
What?
I didn't...
set a timer, did I?
Trust your brain,
not your eyes.
Yeah, well, my mistake, I guess, huh?
What day is Mommy and Daddy's
anniversary?
October 7th.
Right.
Good boy.
All right, let's get this, uh,
let's get this going.
All right, all right.
Let's go, let's go.
Just hold on a second.
Hold your horses,
hold your horses.
Hurry.
Come on, come on. I got it.
That's awesome.
Hurry.
Go.
Here we go.
Happy anniversary!
Oh, you guys.
We love you, Mom.
I love you, too, sweetie.
More than anything.
Blow the candle out.
Come on, blow the candles out.
One, two.
Trust your brain,
trust your brain.
Trust your brain.
What the hell, dad?
I'm sorry. This isn't my house.
I don't deserve it.
Hello?
Why don't you just
leave me alone?
You're not real.
You're not real.
Goddammit, you're not real!
What're you doing?
Oh, you still
like to watch, huh?
Yeah. You're still
my little peeping Tom,
huh?
You come out when you're done,
all right?
Hey, little brother.
No.
No, no, no, no,
this isn't happening.
You're in prison.
They told me
you were getting released.
Holy shit, look at you.
All grown up.
Well, don't look at me
like I'm a stranger.
Well, it has been a long time.
I knew you had your issues,
but it would have been nice
if you replied to some
of my letters over the years.
Out of sight, out of mind, huh?
How did you get in here?
I came in through the window
in the big room there.
You left it open for me.
No, no, I didn't leave
any window open.
I meant unlocked.
Jesus. Relax, Tommy.
The window's locked.
Well, I locked it
behind me, obviously.
You shouldn't just go leaving
your windows unlocked, Tommy.
Can't be too careful
with all those crazies around.
No.
This isn't real.
What?
You're not real.
Is that so?
I'm sorry, you just
broke out of prison
to come say hi?
That's bullshit.
They let you out of the nuthouse
a little early, huh?
My pills.
You know that
I don't have my medication.
-You know that.
-You know that, Tommy.
How would I know that?
What's the difference?
I don't want you here.
I just got here.
Let it ring, we're having
a conversation here.
No, if I don't answer it,
it'll call the cops.
-No, that's a violation.
They'll send me back
to the institute.
I can't go back there.
I can't go back,
-I can't go back.
What we really want, deep down?
To go back.
No.
State your name.
Thomas Walker.
Thank you. You may hang up.
Alex?
Alex?
No, just relax.
Go to sleep, he's gone.
He's gone, he's gone.
What?
What?
No, I didn't--
I didn't do this.
Ah!
Oh, Christ.
Relax, Tommy.
You trashed the house.
Well, technically,
you trashed the house.
Why would I--
why would I trash the house?
You tell me.
Hello, Tom?
It's Lynn.
Hey, hi. Yeah, it's me.
It's my--I'm--it's--I'm Tom.
Yeah, I figured it would be
seeing as no one else is there.
Did you listen
to my gray mix yet?
No. I mean, I did.
It was good.
It was...
eclectic.
Yeah, I kind of forgot
about that last song.
And sometimes I set
the next mix early
and I'm sorry,
this one got a little
bit pink at the end.
So,
I've been thinking about you.
Uh-hmm.
Did my homework too.
I found out some
pretty interesting stuff.
So, I was thinking
I wanna come up--
- Nope, no, no, no, no.
--and talk.
No need. It's, uh,
been really busy up here.
So, just stay at the market--
the market.
Lynn, does the Red Pepper Market
have a pharmacy?
Uh, yeah. Why?
I'm just--I'm a little low
on my meds.
So, what the hell
do you want me to do?
Do you want me to boost drugs?
Well, I mean...
yeah.
What is it that you need?
Lithitol?
Lynn?
That's serious
antipsychotic shit.
Yeah, uh, how do you know that?
Um, look, the pharmacy closes
in two minutes, so I'm just
gonna slip in there now
-and see what I can do. But--
-Thank you.
--you're gonna owe me
quite the explanation.
Thank you.
Who the hell
are you, Tom Walker?
Alex?
Alex?
Stop playing games.
What the hell, Alex?
Okay.
You're okay.
You're...
You're...
You're okay.
Oh.
Skinny dipping? Nice.
What are you doing here?
Really?
Do you mind?
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
You got a pressurized leak.
What?
How do you know that?
My father is a pool cleaner.
So,
what are you--
what are you doing here?
Need a fix, remember?
Nice place, by the way.
Is it the maid's year off
or something?
Well, thank you so much
for bringing these over
but if my parole officer
catches me
with someone inside the house,
I'm screwed.
I just--I need to make it
through these next 30 days.
Wow. You're barely
out of the gate.
Can I just have my pills?
Maybe we can talk later
on the phone?
Oh, crap.
Is this me?
Um...
Yeah.
I've actually been
drawing you a lot.
It's kind of, creepy, huh?
I wouldn't blame you
if you just...
left the pills and,
you know, took off.
I love it.
I always wanted a stalker.
I just never knew
I was so beautiful.
You are.
It's Glycamine,
it's pretty much
the same thing as Lithitol
so, it should do the trick.
Um,
sorry,
you're just gonna have
to explain this to me.
I'd like to hear
your side of the story.
I just wanna help you.
Okay. If I tell you,
will you just leave?
Yeah, I mean,
if that's what you want.
Okay.
Okay.
When I was 13 years old,
I had a real crush
on this older girl,
Julie DeMarco,
and when I asked her out
she totally rejected me
in front of the whole school
and when I told
my brother Alex about it,
he said that
we should teach her a lesson.
You know, give her
a little scare
as payback.
So, we hid under this bridge
that was on her way home
from this Wendy's
that she worked at
and when we jumped out,
he was right,
it scared the shit
out of her.
Then she started yelling at us
and calling us immature.
Alex didn't like that.
He kind of--he just snapped
and started whaling on her.
I mean, it was brutal.
I told him it was wrong.
But I think he must've known
that I wasn't gonna like it
because...
he took out this pair
of handcuffs
and chained me to a metal pipe.
I just had to sit there
and watch.
And then he drowned her...
right in front of me.
I remember as the life was...
going out of her,
he looked right up at me
and he said,
"I'm just doing
what you couldn't.
Sometimes it takes two men
to make one brother."
Jesus.
And then he made me
bury the body with him
and said
we were in this together,
we were partners for life.
I was so messed up after that.
So, he did it again
with another girl on his own
and this time,
he got caught.
You know, it all came out.
I was convicted of the first
murder alongside Alex.
No one believed
that I just watched.
He got life in prison
and I got the institute
on an insanity verdict.
My mind was...
ruined.
Okay. Well, we had a deal.
So,
thank you so much for the pills.
Have a great life.
You don't have to be alone.
Okay. Well, actually
the court says I do.
I might understand you
more than you think.
Hello, Tom.
You enjoying the house?
I wish I had the courage
to say this to your face
but...
as, uh, you know,
I never had the courage
to say anything to your face.
Believe me.
I'm not proud of this.
I left a lot of things
unresolved.
-Video file
recorded five days ago,
the night he killed himself.
I know you blame yourself
for what happened.
This isn't real.
It's as real as I am, brother.
For your mother leaving,
leaving and not looking back.
The truth is,
her leaving had nothing to do
with you two boys
being locked up.
The real problem
developed between
the two of us.
Our relationship worked
because I always knew
what was best.
We had rules--
Hey, buddy.
Just tell us where it is.
But with both of you
boys gone...
Where what is?
...her behavior
became unpredictable.
She would never talk back
like that to me before.
I would--I would--
I would've done anything
to keep her from leaving.
What I'm--what I'm--
what I'm trying to say is,
it's...
it's not your fault, Tommy.
I don't blame you.
He didn't hate me.
I know--I know it was selfish
to stop visiting you,
hide you away
like you didn't exist.
God, it was all in my head.
No shit, Tommy, what isn't?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh good.
Only Mom hated us.
Dad just cared more
about his career.
I'm glad he cleared that up.
I feel a lot better now.
You don't know
that Mom hated us.
She left us, didn't she?
We were just children
and she left us to rot
in that jail.
What do you imagine
was so important
that she never came to see us,
never wrote, never called.
She just erased all memory
of her children.
What do you call that, Tommy?
I call that, hate.
We did a lot of thinking
in that cage
about Mom and Dad.
Each abandoning us
in their own way.
But we came to one inevitable
conclusion, didn't we?
I'm the only one
you can count on to be there.
We're in this together
and it's up to us
to take what they denied us.
What do you want?
What do you--what are you
looking for here?
I'm looking for the same
thing you are, little brother.
A chance at peace, Tommy,
freedom.
Hidden amongst dad's secrets
in this house,
there's money
and that money is ours.
Wait, what?
Yeah.
I don't want money.
I don't want any of this.
I'm here because
you needed me,
okay?
Trust me. You do need me.
No, I don't need you.
I have my pills now, Alex.
I don't want you here,
okay?
The only thing I wanna do
is serve my next 30 days
and then, for the first time
in my entire life,
I'm gonna be free.
They're kicking in.
Tom, where are you?
This is bad.
Are you okay?
You know, I've had better days.
I didn't realize
how sick you are.
Listen, I'm not--
Listen to me.
I'm gonna go home
and get your pills.
Holy shit.
Thank you, Lynn.
Goodbye, Alex.
Oh, yeah.
Hmm.
Alex?
Alex?
His bike.
Yes! Yes.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, come in. Come in.
I had to come by after work
because I felt really bad
-for what you told me.
-No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, you know what,
don't worry about it.
I'm surprised
you're so hospitable
all of a sudden because you
couldn't have gotten rid of me
faster before.
Oh, um,
that was before my meds
kicked in.
I'm feeling...
much better now.
You were seeing
some pretty weird shit, huh?
Yeah, you could say that.
Hey, uh,
you want something to drink?
Yeah.
I'll take some of that...
grape juice straight up.
I'm glad my drug trafficking
paid off.
Yeah.
It's worse when I'm alone.
Back in the institute,
all these people around,
I could, kind of, control it.
But here by myself,
I just--I thought
maybe the drugs
wouldn't be enough, you know.
Well, you have...
27 more days to go.
Yeah.
I think I'll always
be haunted though,
because I didn't do anything
except watch that day.
What would you have done?
You were 12.
You were handcuffed.
I could have ignored his threats
and gone to the police
after that first murder.
If I did that,
that other girl
might still be alive.
But...
I've come to see
that there's nothing
I can do about that.
I just have to make
the best choices I can
from here on out.
How the hell
are you still such an optimist?
I mean, after all the shit
that you've been through.
I'm not an optimist. I've--
I just don't think
I have any other choices.
I mean, what can I do?
Give up?
Sometimes, yeah.
Yeah.
You can be surrounded by people
and...
still feel so alone.
I did everything
to try to fit in. I...
was nice to them,
I smiled at them...
and they just took
advantage of that.
The boys in our school,
they...
treated me like I was their dog.
I think that the worst part is,
is that...
I went along with it.
You start to hear
that you're worthless
so many times,
you start to believe them.
I know what it's like
to take medication
and not feel normal.
And I know what it's like
not to trust yourself
with your own life.
Shit.
What a pair.
Um, can you excuse me
for a moment?
Because I'm--I--
I'm like a hot mess right now.
I just need to go
to the bathroom.
Wait, Lynn?
Yes?
Um,
if I, I mean, if--
when I get done with my...
30 days,
-would you--
-I'd love to.
Uh, what?
That's real.
Oh, Jesus.
What did I do?
Oh, sh--
I d--I didn't--
Fuck it.
-No.
-Oh, Jesus.
Look, this isn't what--
- Put her down.
- No, no, no...
-Put her down.
-I--
-Put her down now.
-Okay. Okay.
Put her down.
Get away from her.
Why did you do this?
What happened to you?
Why the hell did you do this?
I didn't. Um, I mean...
Is this because of your brother?
What? Wait,
what happened to my brother?
He burned in a prison fire.
Is he dead? Are--do you know
for a fact that he's dead?
Ah!
Oh.
Well, I guess that settles it.
I'm real.
You mean, you're--
Oh, Alex, what--
-What you couldn't.
-Get the phone, Tommy,
before it calls the cops.
Get the phone now.
State your name.
Tom...
I'm as real as you are, brother.
Well, if I'd have had it my way,
I would've convinced you
otherwise.
Where did you go?
For a crazy hermit
with no friends,
you have a very active
social life.
What are you gonna do
with that?
We're gonna have some fun.
No, you're not--
There's a tunnel.
I saw--I saw a tunnel
next to the pool.
It leads to a bunker
or, like a, uh,
vault or something.
Oh, yeah?
All right.
Don't start without me.
Come on.
What are you doing?
You got to get out of here
right now, okay?
You got to get in your car,
and you got to drive, now, go.
Run. Run, run.
Why are you still here?
Time to finish this, Tommy.
Was the money in the vault?
There's nothing down there
that I want.
You saw him, you saw Dad,
didn't you?
You saw Dad down there.
You saw Dad down there,
didn't you?
Remember these?
-No.
-Yeah.
No.
Alex. Alex.
No. No, no, no, no.
Don't do it, Alex.
Alex, don't--
Alex, don't do it.
Please.
Alex, don't do it.
You do what you do best,
little brother.
Watch.
Shit.
I need
my little peeping Tom
and you need me.
No. No. No.
Just like...
old times.
No, no, no.
Watch this, Tommy.
No! Please!
No, please, no.
Oh, God.
No. No.
Please. No, please no.
No.
No, I'm not watching
another goddamn thing.
No.
Go to hell.
You wanna see hell, huh?
I'll show you hell.
I'll show you hell.
Ahh.
Fuck.
Have fun down there,
little brother.
Oh, God.
God.
He was messed up,
wasn't he?
More than either of us
could ever be.
I guess you never really know
someone until they're dead
and you get to pick over
their bones.
This isn't real.
None of this is real.
You're not real, okay?
None of this exists.
This is all in my--
it's all in my head.
That's priceless.
You spent 20 years
wishing your eyes
would show you the truth
and when they finally do,
all you want is to retreat back
into your head.
Ambiguity is bliss, huh, Tommy?
Well, let me cure you
of your uncertainty
once and for all.
Our father was sick
and he made you what you are
and he made me what I am.
And his blood was poison
and it ruined us both.
And now I'm gonna prove it
with your little girlfriend.
No.
Look at the--
look at the phone.
Look at my parole phone.
Notice anything?
That's real.
The cops will be here
any minute.
Not before I take this out
on your girlfriend.
Well, I found the money.
Bullshit.
I don't trust you.
You don't have time not to.
It's in a safe down here.
Okay, you just let Lynn go
and I promise you
that there's a safe
and I swear to God,
I'll tell you the combination.
What about your new best friend
down there?
Aren't the two of you
getting along?
What?
1007.
Move.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Oh, my God.
You never left.
Oh, my God, you never left.
It's me.
It's--it's your Tommy.
It's Tommy.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Mom.
Oh, Mom, I'm sorry.
What is that? Wait, wait, wait.
Stay right here. Stay here.
Stay here for one second.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, Mom.
I'm sorry.
Okay. Come on.
It's a family reunion.
Hey, Mom.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.
It's okay,
it's over.
-Oh!
Oh, my God.
What did you do?
What did you do?!
The same as always, Tommy.
What you wanted to but couldn't.
No.
You bastard.
Open the safe.
No.
What?
Open the safe now.
Hurry up.
Five...
four...
Um,
his office.
He had to have set this
for the office.
-Three.
-Fuck. Just...
- Hurry, hurry.
- Breathe, breathe, come on,
breathe, it's okay, it's--
two...
Maybe phone number.
1007.
Ten-oh-seven.
October 7th.
Their anniversary.
October 7th.
One.
That was close.
I knew it was here.
Get back.
I knew it was here.
Here.
We're still
in this together,
two men, one brother.
That's one too many for me.
