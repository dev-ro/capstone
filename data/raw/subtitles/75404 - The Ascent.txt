Sotnikov, let's move out!
I'll cover you!
Move out!
I can't -
Rest.
Just a moment. Just a moment, dear.
We'll get you something to drink,
something to eat.
Krotsky -
What?
Get it out.
Get what out?
Whatever there is left to eat.
Well, that was good going.
So where are the sleds?
We should move on.
Then we'll be okay.
We need to get out of here
and find something to eat.
Then you'll be the one to get it.
We have to stay here a while.
You know the Kurgaev farm?
Kurgaev? I do.
He's got a woman there.
Hey, you. Watch it.
Make a run over there. Be quick.
This is us.
Here's Dubovoi's camp.
- What about the wounded?
- And the children?
The families need to be delivered safely.
And without food, you yourself know -
It's still a long ways to Dubovoi.
A long way to go.
How about finding a boar?
We could feed everyone.
Pack up.
What, alone?
Take someone with you.
Stoptsov.
What kind of help could I be?
Right.
Matyushenko.
- They're calling you.
What's going on there?
This weapon's jammed.
But I could go.
Whatever you say.
No. Fix it so it shoots by morning.
Fine.
Is your weapon in order, Artillery?
All in order.
Kolya!
Say hi to Zosya!
Eat some snow. It helps.
Damn! Won't go away.
Can't do anything about it.
Why didn't you stay?
Someone else could've come.
Who?
We're in deep now.
Used up the last of the ammo
on some patrollers.
Doesn't matter.
Once we get to Dubovoi, we'll have plenty.
You shoot pretty good.
Good eye.
Are you really from the artillery?
- Really.
A regular soldier then.
Not quite.
How's that?
I taught math.
I graduated from the teacher's college
in Vitebsk.
Math? That's good.
Walk in my footsteps.
It'll be easier.
I've been meaning to visit her
for a while now -
- Who?
- Zosya.
My Zosya's there. She's terrific.
You've got girls on your mind.
Why not? It's not all just about war.
No, it's not like that.
Zosya and her folks are like family to me.
They hid me when I was wounded,
and with the Germans all about.
You were surrounded?
They saved me, didn't give me away.
They knew who they were hiding -
a company commander, after all.
A regular soldier.
When we were parting,
Kurgaev gave me his short fur coat.
Then they sent me off to the partisans
as if I were their own son.
Are you kidding?
No hard feelings at all.
Even though they knew
about Zosya and me.
You know,
she came to me on her own.
I wasn't even thinking about it.
I was sleeping.
And in the morning,
I hear someone breathing heavily.
I felt heat sweeping all over me.
Damn. I would've married right away
if it wasn't for the war.
Is it still a long way?
We're getting close already.
See what I mean?
Talking makes the road shorter.
I don't know about you
but I can't stand
these lone assignments.
Even the easiest ones.
I'd rather make a hundred attacks,
as long as I'm in the ranks.
But at night, the forest -
It's hard, you know.
Maybe -
Maybe they... had time to get out.
Tell you what. Go on back.
I'll go on
another couple of kilometers.
Can't go back empty-handed.
What the hell?
I said I'd go alone.
You'll freeze without a hat.
- Hats don't grow in the woods.
In the village, every man has a hat.
So I should snatch it
from someone, you say?
Snatch it?
There's always a way to talk to people.
You just need to know how.
Here. It's warmer than nothing.
- No, don't.
Cut it out. Don't be fussy.
It's nice and warm.
Want some?
Go ahead, eat.
Actually, thanks for not leaving.
When there are two -
Well, let's move on.
Where is this damn village?
Are you the headman?
Well?
Anyone else here?
Just us.
Any Germans in the village?
Germans? No.
There's only a policeman left behind.
Got a cow?
Yes.
So far.
You should eat something.
I've got something hot here.
Fine, but make it quick.
So you work for the Germans.
Do they pay much?
I haven't asked for anything,
and I haven't gotten anything.
He's an old man.
He did a stupid thing.
- Keep quiet.
Take your hat off.
- Your son?
- Our son. Our Tolya.
Is he with the police too?
No, for God's sake!
He's at the front.
We don't know if he's alive or not.
Yeah.
You're a disgrace to your son.
You sold out.
Put your Bible down.
Well!
Gripping like a -
Let's go.
- Son. Son, dear -
- Keep quiet.
Move it.
- Our Father.
- Wait!
Don't! Have mercy on the fool!
Son, dear.
He's going to shoot him.
You should've thought of that earlier.
You think he wanted to be
a German headman?
They threaten him every day.
Shouting.
Putting a gun to his head!
Son, dear, let me out.
Let me see.
Let me see what's happening.
Son, dear -
Son! What are you -
What's with you?
- Nothing.
You're sick with fever.
Your friend's calling you.
He's sick.
Here's some dry raspberries.
You can make tea someplace.
Something to drink.
- No, thanks.
Why not?
Go on.
And shut the door.
What, you're letting him go?
The hell with him.
Sorry.
I'm no help today.
Why the hell did you come then?
You asked already.
"Asked."
Those other two wouldn't come, and you -
Stop it! Stop it already!
Where are we?
I didn't notice.
Are we going the right way?
I think so.
Faster!
So you want to take me alive.
Just a second.
Damn it.
There.
Now you won't take me.
Sotnikov.
Where are you hit?
- In the leg.
Let's go.
I can't.
Come on.
Come on.
What is it?
Come on.
Does it hurt?
What's with you? Help.
One moment.
One moment.
Grab on.
This is the end of it.
Where to now?
It's all lake.
Wait here.
I'll look around.
Looks okay.
There's a cabin close by.
It looks empty.
Sotnikov, what's with you?
You'll see.
Maybe -
I'll take you there.
We'll get warm.
And then -
I'll stay here.
Yeah. You know, that'll be better.
I need to go. The boys are waiting.
I'm frozen.
It's all right.
It's all right, brother.
I'll come back for you.
Then we'll move you.
I'll come back for you.
I'll really come back for you.
Kolya. Everything's fine.
I was only afraid to die
out in the open field.
In the night, alone like a dog.
In the woods, it's not frightening.
The main thing
is to get used to the thought:
Is this to be the end?
Go on in.
Are you alone here?
Yeah.
Where's your father?
He's gone.
Your mother?
She works for old man Yemelyan,
earning money for food.
I see.
Any Germans in the village?
No.
They came once and took our pig.
They took it away in a truck.
What's your mother's name?
- Demchika.
- So you must be Demyan, then, right?
They also call Mama "Polgeniya."
Are you partisans too?
What do you need to know for?
You're just a kid.
Say, is there any hot water?
There is. Wait.
Bring us some.
Maybe you've got some food too?
Mama boiled potatoes.
Do you have any bread?
Leonik ate it all yesterday.
Here's some, a treat.
Thank you.
Scram!
That's Mama.
Mama! We've got partisans here!
Hello, ma'am.
What's this about?
We were waiting for you.
What for?
There's no bread. There's no butter.
Galya, take Katya.
No hens to lay eggs!
We're being nice to you, woman,
and you're angry with us.
If I were angry with you,
you'd be out of here.
Galya, I said take Katya!
I'll punish you!
When's the last time you saw Dyomka?
How do you know about Dyomka?
We know him.
He's wounded.
The bullet's still inside him.
We'll have to get it out.
Forget it. You can't get it out.
They say there was crying
over by Lesiny all night.
They say a German got shot.
Who says?
The old women always talk.
The old women?
The old women know everything.
Get out of there.
All right. That's that.
But now what?
That's the question.
How should I know
what you should do?
You see?
He can't walk. That's for sure.
You got here, didn't you?
Quit it, Rybak. Let's go.
Hold on!
Germans.
They're heading this way.
In the attic! In the attic!
In the attic! Go!
Hello, Prava. How are things?
See any strangers?
Like I've got nothing better to do
than to look for strangers.
- Seen any or not?
- No.
Invite your guests into the house.
They're inviting everyone to the cemetery,
and you call them "guests".
What did you say?
You're gonna get it.
Hurry up! Don't stand there.
Can't you see they're cold?
Make up something to eat.
Who stole our pig?
You shameless bastard!
And you're a Red Army bitch!
Maggot!
German scum!
Bitte, come inside.
I tell you there's no one there!
- Where's the ladder?
- We never had one.
All right, if you don't want to -
Come here!
Come here! Red bitch!
Hold it right there, like this.
Give me the machine gun.
I'll rake through it.
Don't shoot!
Gotcha, sweeties!
Get your hands up! Now!
Hands up! Hands up!
Well, well. So here they are.
Get your hands up, I said!
Mama!
Mama!
My babies! My sweet babies!
My babies! My babies!
Stas', tell them to let me go!
Stas', who'll take care of the kids?
Let her go.
The woman's got nothing to do with this!
You Red scum!
Bastard! Why do you need to hit him?
Here. This'll keep you quiet.
Got a smoke?
What are you staring at?
And, you, move it.
You're crawling along like a fly.
COMMANDANT
Take these rabbits!
We'll find a home for you.
Find out where to put them.
You, short coat, get out!
I'll deal with the short-coat.
Go on.
Get up, you partisan scum.
And you to the commissar.
Go on!
You scum!
You bastard!
Help me out here.
Who are you?
Gamanyuk!
Why is he roughed-up?
My fault.
- Why is he on the floor?
- My fault.
- Were these my orders?
- My fault.
Did you say something?
Untie him.
Let's get acquainted.
My name's Portnov.
Police investigator.
My name won't mean anything to you.
Tell me anyway.
Let's just say Ivanov.
I've nothing against that.
Let it be Ivanov.
From what squadron?
Don't start with that.
I'm not saying anything.
You won't?
No.
What was your assignment?
Where were you going?
How long has that woman
been your agent?
She's no agent.
We chanced upon her.
And you visited the headman
by chance too.
- Yes, just by chance.
- Not too original.
Do what you want with us,
but don't touch the woman.
She's got three kids.
I had no idea there were kids there.
Where were you wounded?
In the woods, two days ago.
It wasn't in the woods.
And it was last night.
See?
I know enough about you
to have you shot.
I can even see you're prepared for that.
But the children.
The children.
It's impossible
to prove their mother is innocent.
You were found in her house,
with weapons.
And there's a war on.
You made a mistake.
- I know it.
- So fix it.
Where's your squadron, your comrades?
Their positions.
You want to save the woman
without giving up anything?
That won't work.
You'll have to trouble your conscience.
One way or the other,
you'll have to.
There's no way out.
None.
I won't betray anyone.
Not anyone.
There are things more important
than one's own hide.
Where?
What is it? What's it made of?
That's nonsense.
We're mortal.
With death, everything ends for us -
all of life.
The entire world.
It's not worth it.
For what?
As an example for future generations?
But you won't
have a heroic death either.
You won't just die.
You'll croak like a traitor.
And if you won't tell,
someone else will.
And we'll write it off to you.
Understand?
Scum.
Human scum.
Gamanyuk.
Right here.
- Ask the chief -
- The redhead?
Yes.
Now you'll see what true scum is.
Don't be surprised.
It won't be me, but yourself.
You'll discover something
in yourself that -
that you'd never imagine.
Where will your perseverance go?
And the fanatic glitter in your eyes.
It'll all be taken over by fear.
That's right.
The fear of losing that hide.
And then you'll find out who you are -
alone, deserted -
a simple human nonentity
full of ordinary shit.
Without any of your
noble words or arrogance.
There.
That's where the truth is.
You didn't insult me.
No.
I know what a human being really is.
And you'll find out too.
Listen.
What were you before the war?
Go on, begin.
Take him away!
Who's your partner?
What's his last name?
- Well -
- Don't lie! Don't lie!
I really don't know.
I haven't been in the squadron long.
What's his connection to the woman?
- With Demchika?
- Yes.
None.
You want to stay alive?
Of course.
Who doesn't want to live?
Have a seat.
Last name.
Rybak.
- Birth date.
- 1916.
Where were you born?
Near Gomel.
Where were you headed?
For food, to the farm.
Turned out the village
had been burned down.
What village?
What's it called? Kurgaev.
And how did you end up in Lesiny?
Simple. We walked at night
and found the headman.
So you were going to the headman?
Of course not.
I said we were going to the farm.
Who's the head of your troop?
What's his name? Dubovoi.
Where's the squadron?
- In the woods.
- Which woods?
Parkovsky.
How many people in the squadron?
- Around 500.
- You're lying!
According to our information,
Dubovoi has more.
Of course there were more.
There's all those punishment forces.
There are battles, losses.
They've put you in a squeeze.
And that's only the beginning.
So you were going to Lesiny?
I said we were going to the farm.
The farm had burned down.
That's right.
And Kurgaev and Kurgaev's kids
have been shot!
So you were born in Mogilev.
Mogilev -
From Mogilev or from around Gomel?
From Gomel. From Gomel.
- Last name!
- Whose?
- Yours!
- Rybak.
Who was shooting at night -
him or you?
Him then.
Right?
What's his last name?
I don't know.
And that headman -
Sych, as you say - what is he?
What Sych? What Sych?
I didn't say anything!
I don't know any Sych!
Fine. Fine.
I see you've got a head on your shoulders.
I think we'll save your life.
You don't believe it?
We can do that.
If you don't lie,
you'll join the police.
You'll serve Greater Germany.
Me?
Yes. You.
Why, you -
You don't have to answer right away.
Go and think it over.
What did you say the last name was?
Gamanyuk!
Right here.
Well?
I don't know.
No.
Good boy.
Put him in the basement.
But the redhead -
Are you deaf?
And bring in the headman.
- Got it.
Bitte, please.
Have a rest, sweetie!
Bastards!
What did they do to you?
Kolya, did you -
Did you scream?
It doesn't matter.
Did you stand up to it?
It'll be all right.
Bastards.
It can't be.
We'll make it out.
Listen to me.
The main thing
is to get our stories right.
It's like this.
We were after food, the farm was burnt down,
and we came to Lesiny. Got it?
- It's senseless.
- Quit that!
Don't be stupid. Just listen.
We're from Dubovoi's squadron.
The squadron's in the Parkovsky Woods.
Everyone knows that.
Let them try to get in there. There's
a whole army there! They'll smoke them!
Listen, we need to think up something.
It's easy to croak.
We need to find a way out!
It's not going to work.
We need to play them
like a fish on a line.
If you pull too hard,
it will tear and all's lost!
Play it like you're human.
They already offered
to take me into the police force.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I said "play."
Kolya -
I wasn't born yesterday either.
How can you?
We're soldiers.
Soldiers.
Don't crawl in shit.
You'll never wash it off.
So then, to the grave -
to feed the worms.
Right?
That's not the worst that could happen.
No. That's not what we're talking about.
Now I understand.
I understand.
The important thing
is to be true to yourself.
Fool!
You're a fool, Sotnikov.
You graduated from the institute
for nothing.
I want to live! To live!
To kill those bastards!
Understand?
I'm the soldier.
And you're a corpse.
All you've got left is your stubbornness -
your principles!
Then you go on living - without a conscience.
It can be done.
You're talking to me... about conscience?
And who got this woman...
and me - strong and whole -
into this mess?
You! A man of conscience.
And in the attic - wounded and sick -
why weren't you first to get your hands up?
Your conscience stopped you?
Rybak saved you and the village.
Got that?
My conscience... thinks!
And yours -
- What?
We need to get the job done!
And you - "Conscience, conscience!"
Aren't you hoping for anything?
You're lying. You are hoping.
Like you were hoping back in the field.
And we made it! Precisely!
We need to survive!
By joining the police?
Then don't waste time.
You -
You know what you are?
- Kolya -
- Into the grave!
And you're dragging me in
to keep you company!
You're scared to be alone!
You lying scum!
You're scared!
Why, you -
Sotnikov!
Why'd you close your eyes, Sotnikov?
Listen. How about some water?
What are you doing here?
Look how they mangled him.
But I see you were more fortunate.
The battle is still to come.
I know what's still to come.
They won't leave things as they are.
Here's water.
And make sure your bandit
is looking good by morning. Got it?
What's in the morning?
Who are you?
Basya.
Aren't you the shoemaker
Meyer's daughter?
Yes.
What do they want from you?
To tell them who hid me.
But you didn't tell, did you?
Don't be scared.
Don't be scared. Come here.
Come along.
Get in, scum!
Why are you pushing?
There are men here!
You'll be here till the morning!
What happens in the morning?
In the morning -
Look who's pushing us around!
Damn bastard!
They didn't put you away long enough
for that knife fight!
Should've put you away for life,
you scum!
And my Dyomka stood up for him
in court. The fool.
My babies.
My poor, sweet babies.
Without me, alone and hungry.
Don't worry. Maybe you'll be fine.
"Fine." Sure.
They've gone mad!
They say the German
that got shot croaked.
All those damn scum should croak!
So that's what it is.
And Pavlo - how about that?
An investigator.
Who'd think, a Judas like that!
Who's that - Portnov?
Of course. He's from the farm.
Everyone knows him.
He was traveling all around before the war -
giving lectures, and rather well.
I remember him when he was an admirer.
When he came out of the Vitebsk Institute,
he became so pompous.
The institute?
Sure. He worked
as the club administrator.
And the choir.
Mr. Portnov was our choir director.
I sang two songs there.
"Campfires Burning High."
And "Evening Bells."
And he -
He interrogated you?
Listen.
Didn't you study in Vitebsk?
Maybe you know him.
Maybe he's a classmate.
You could talk to him.
Don't think about it.
So that's why he was asking about you.
"Who is he?" "Who is he?"
Don't think about it.
It's easier for Pavel that way.
That sell-out swine!
We will! We will remember!
We'll remember in our graves!
I waited and waited.
And I was so hungry.
But I was scared
to come out of the bushes.
Then the rains came.
All the leaves fell,
and the bushes turned bare.
I didn't want to eat or even to move.
Once, I opened my eyes
and saw Auntie Proskovia.
You mean Suprunikha?
She recognized me.
A good-hearted woman.
So what's it to you?
Whoever it might be...
all they want is to get information.
You shouldn't say that.
We'll all die together.
Dear God, forgive me.
Dear God, have mercy on me.
My son.
My son.
Dear God, what's happening?
My son.
Don't leave us. Can you hear me?
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent before all men!
I worked in secret for Dubovoi.
He made me headman.
"You'll help us and save people."
Do you hear?
My son. I'm not the enemy.
Can you hear me?
I'm innocent!
Rybak.
- Rybak!
- What?
Closer!
What is it?
Don't let me die before morning.
Don't let me die.
Kolya, I'll take all the blame.
- What are you saying?
- Don't let me -
- Hang in there!
- Don't let me die.
Water!
Quickly!
- Let me.
- It can't be!
- He's sick.
- Drink some.
Drink a little.
Drink.
Old man...
back there, I wanted to -
To kill me?
But you didn't, did you?
Don't torment yourself.
I'll die like a human being now,
not like a dog.
Listen.
Brother.
What's happening?
Brother! Brother!
Damn. I thought -
Hang on.
It can't -
What will you tell them?
The main thing is to stay calm.
Don't act proud.
Let me... fall asleep.
What? No, no!
Later. You said -
Don't fall asleep.
Everybody out. Liquidation.
Move it!
Come here, one-legged man!
- Call the investigator.
- Too late for investigation.
Too late?
What do you mean too late?
Hands off!
Call Portnov!
What's so difficult?
Are you human or not?
Bring the investigator over!
Tie up the old man.
Call the investigator!
Tie him up.
Stop it. Stop it, will you?
Investigator!
Tell them! I want to make a statement!
Herr Major, excuse me.
This partisan wants to make
some sort of a statement.
Free these people.
They have nothing to do with this.
I'm the partisan!
It was me who was carrying out
the squadron's orders!
It was me who killed your German man.
They're all here by accident!
Shoot me alone!
What now?
Do something... for them.
And that's all, citizen lvanov?
No. Not Ivanov.
My name's Sotnikov.
Commander, Red Army.
Born in 1917.
Bolshevik.
Party member since 1935.
Teacher by profession.
At the start of the war,
I commanded a battery.
It's a shame I didn't kill
more of you bastards.
My name is Sotnikov - Boris Andreevich.
I have a father, a mother
and a motherland.
Herr Major, nothing important.
Mr. Investigator, sir! Just a minute!
You said yesterday -
And I agree! I agree!
I've nothing to do with this,
for God's sake!
He'll tell you so!
I agree!
- Kolya!
- I agree!
- Kolya!
Herr Major, excuse me.
This guy's asking to join the police.
Maybe we should keep him,
try him out.
You agree to join the police?
I agree.
Then untie him.
You're letting him go?
Then let me go too!
I'll tell!
I'll tell who was hiding her!
I've got babies!
Dear God, what'll they do?
Then tell me.
- It was -
- Think what you're doing.
So, who was it? Tell me. Tell me.
Well?
It was Fyodor Burak, I think.
What, Burak?
He's not here anymore.
Think a little harder.
Speak up!
I told you already.
- Gamanyuk.
- I've told you!
Shut your mouth!
Hold on to her.
Help him.
Get moving!
Move it!
Don't struggle!
Keep walking!
I'll escape.
I'll escape.
I'll escape.
I'll escape.
I'll escape.
I'll escape.
The chief's not happy.
Not enough people.

Get up, woman.
Think about what you're doing.
Come to your senses.
Forgive me.

Judas.
Move along.
What are you staring at?
What's with you?
Move it.
Come along. Come along.
Hey, take the bench.
Come see me later.

Not "Yes, sir", but "Jawohl."
Get used to it.
I'm hungry.
- Where's that jerk?
- In the outhouse.
Hey you!
Hey, you jerk!
Get out of there.
The boss is waiting.
You going to be long?
