Here you go, love.
Thanks.
Didn't you ask
for scrambled eggs?
Yeah.
- It's all good.
- No, it's not.
It's just eggs.
- I have a thing about that.
- Eggs?
No, about people
not doing their job well.
Man, she got four kids and
an alcoholic husband at home.
- She doing the best she can.
- How do you know that?
She comes through my line
every Sunday,
yelling at her kids,
giving me a stack of coupons.
She can never find
her Costco card,
so I always let her use mine
so she can get a discount.
That's nice of you.
Can I ask you something?
I don't know. Can you?
- Easy. I know good grammar.
- Do you?
We're not in a classroom.
Are you gonna ask me
your question or not?
What took you so long
to respond to me?
I didn't realize
that much time had passed.
I sent you a very well-crafted
message three weeks ago.
I spell-checked it
and everything. Got crickets.
Then, today, out of the blue,
you hit me up,
asking if you want
to grab dinner.
What changed?
I had a shitty day.
What was so shitty about it?
The state decided
to execute my client.
- I didn't know that was still legal here.
- Yep.
It's legal in 31 states,
and Ohio happens
to be one of them.
Was he innocent?
Even if he's not,
the state shouldn't decide
whether he lives or dies.
Sorry.
Me, too.
Normally, I would go home and
have a glass of wine by myself,
but I didn't feel like
being alone.
Not tonight.
You didn't have any friends
or family you can call?
No.
So you turned to Tinder.
Yeah.
What made you pick me?
I liked your picture.
Word?
You had this sad look
on your face.
I felt sorry for you.
Damn.
I didn't mean for that
to sound shady.
Well, it did.
My dad took that picture of me.
And, to be honest, I don't have
many photos of myself.
- Why not?
- I know what I look like.
Pictures aren't just
about vanity.
They're proof
of your existence.
My family know I exist.
That's enough.
You gonna eat that?
You can have some.
Mm.
Man, they always use just the
right amount of dressing here.
Do you really like this place,
or is it the only spot
you could afford?
It's black-owned.
Touché.
You know, you really
shouldn't text and drive.
Ain't nobody texting.
I'm making sure
I don't get lost.
I could tell you
how to get to my house.
- Give me my phone.
- Relax. I'm gonna give it back.
- So, you gonna tell me where to turn?
- Yeah, just...
Oh, so now you're gonna
point the directions.
I'm telling you where to go.
You made a playlist?
That's cute.
Don't go through my phone.
Did you like
"In a Sentimental Mood"
before or after Love Jones?
I knew about that shit
way before Love Jones.
Mm-hmm. Don't lie.
I mean, okay,
I fucked with it more
after I saw the movie.
I appreciate your honesty.
So, what happens tonight?
You're gonna drop me off,
and then you'll go home,
I guess.
Oh.
Did you think
we were gonna have sex?
Nah.
Nah. What do you...
No.
Wow.
I thought we were
gonna hang out.
- Maybe get to know each other.
- Mm.
Nah, I'm good.
Pull over.
Damn.
Do you have any warrants?
- Really?
- Do you?
Nah, I ain't got no warrants.
Do you have any weapons
in the car? Any narcotics?
Um, I got a...
I got a pocketknife
in the glove compartment.
- That's fine.
- I know it is.
Turn the radio down?
- Put your hand down.
- He only had it up
because you're shining
a light in his eyes.
I'm just trying to see
inside the vehicle.
It's just us.
License, registration.
I'm-I'm-I'm...
I'm grabbing my wallet.
I can see that.
Well, y'all like to shoot first
and ask questions later, so...
Got something
you want to say to me?
No, I don't.
You know why
I stopped you tonight?
No, sir.
Failed to execute
a turn signal back there.
You're swerving
a little bit, too.
Oh, my bad.
Yeah, it is.
I can't believe this shit.
Just chill.
I ain't trying to die tonight.
Copy that.
1104, dispatch.
What do you got?
Two occupants...
driver's a black male,
passenger black female...
in a white Honda Accord.
License: "Trust God."
Operator failed
to execute a turn signal,
is driving erratically.
Possible DUI. Over.
Do you need backup?
Negative.
I'm gonna ask you to step out
of the vehicle for me.
Can I ask why, Officer?
No, you may not.
Step out of the car.
Let's go, man.
Back bumper, right there.
Hands on the hood.
I'm gonna ask you one time...
you got anything on you
- I need to know about?
- No, sir.
Illegal substances?
No, sir.
What about in the vehicle?
No, sir.
- You been drinking tonight?
- No.
Why is that funny?
'Cause I don't drink.
Could you do me a favor,
pop the trunk?
- Why?
- 'Cause I asked you to.
Ain't nothing in there
but shoeboxes.
Let's see 'em.
Right there.
May I help you?
Do you have a warrant?
Ma'am, he's already
agreed to the search.
I don't need a warrant.
What's in the boxes?
Shoes.
You mind if I take a look?
That's fine.
Could you please hurry up?
What did you say?
It's just cold.
Put your hands on your head,
- and get on the ground now.
- Are you serious?
Get on the fucking ground!
- Get on the fucking ground!
- Why is he under arrest?
Get back in the car,
or you're going to jail, too!
I am an attorney,
and I demand to know why
- this man is under arrest.
- Sir.
Sir, sir, sir, we don't
have to do this, sir.
- Why is he under arrest?
- You don't have to do this.
- What is your name?
- Get back in the car! - No, no.
- What is your badge number?
- I'm not gonna tell you again!
- Get back in the fucking car!
- Get back in the car.
Get back in the car.
We got this.
Why is he under arrest?
What is your badge number?
Sir, we don't have... Sir, sir,
sir, sir, it was a turn signal.
I ain't... I ain't done
nothing wrong. Sir...
- I'm reaching for my cell phone.
- Keep your hands where I
- can see 'em!
- I have the right to record this arrest.
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em!
- I'm reaching for my cell phone.
- Sir, sir...
Put your fucking hands...
Stop resisting!
Stop! Stay down on the fucking ground!
- Stop...
- Please stop!
Stop fucking resisting!
Now stay down!
Stop fucking resisting!
Stop!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
You good?
Huh? You okay?
Let's go.
We can't just leave him here.
Yes, we can.
Now, let's go.
Come on!
I got to call my dad.
What the fuck are you doing?
We can't call anybody.
It'll make them accomplices.
You could've just
said that shit.
Now we ain't got no phones.
Phone ain't nothing
but a tracking device anyway.
You're bleeding a lot.
It's okay. It only grazed me.
Fuck!
Why didn't you stay in the car?
So, this is my fault?
If I didn't get out the car,
you would be dead right now.
- We got to get you to a hospital.
- No!
We can't. Just keep driving.
Here.
- Use this to stop the bleeding.
- Fuck.
What if he was wearing
a body cam, huh?
There was a camera in the car.
This shit about to be
all over the fucking news.
That's why
we have to keep going.
- We can't run forever.
- I know that!
But right now
we got to keep running
until we come up
with a better plan.
Well, start
throwing out some ideas.
Since when am I in charge
of coming up with the ideas?
Since you made
the decision to run!
We made that decision together.
I don't remember that.
Man, fuck this.
- Where are you going?
- I'm-a find somebody
with a phone
so I can call my family.
If you do that,
then they'll know where we are.
Great.
- What if they kill us?
- Don't say that!
There's no guarantee they won't.
You're a black man that killed
a cop and then took his gun.
I'm not a criminal.
You are now.
I just want to go home,
and I want to see my family.
If you turn yourself in,
you will never see them again.
All we can do is go forward.
There is nothing
back there for us.
Please.
Let's just keep going.
What about your family, huh?
You don't care about
leaving them behind?
No, I don't.
We can't just keep driving.
We need to figure out what
the fuck we gonna do, you know?
All right.
All right, all right.
Let's go to my uncle's house.
We can... we can stay there
for a few days,
then we can figure out
our next move.
Where does your uncle live?
New Orleans.
That's hours from here.
Then we should get going.
Could you please
turn that shit down?
It's the only thing
that calms me.
Well, I can't
hear myself think.
I don't care.
- Don't touch my shit.
- Pull over.
- Why?
- So I can get out.
You ain't going nowhere.
We in this together.
Why are you slowing down?
I'm out of gas.
Why didn't you say something?
What you mean,
why didn't I say something?
I had other shit on my mind.
- Now we got to flag this car down.
- I hope they black.
That ain't always a good thing.
Y'all having car trouble?
Uh, yeah, we...
we ran out of gas.
Ma'am, are you all right?
Yeah. I just...
I accidentally cut myself.
Tell you what, why don't y'all
hop in my truck.
I got a first aid kit
in the back seat.
There's a gas station
up the road.
- I'll give you a ride.
- We don't mind walking.
Come on, now. I don't bite.
I'll give you a ride.
- Sure you're all right there?
- I'm good.
Oh, fuck.
- What?
- What?
Something wrong?
No, I...
- I just didn't know you were a sheriff.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm off duty today.
You know what?
I think we can walk
the rest of the way.
No.
This will be my good deed
for the day.
Uh-huh.
Y'all okay?
Y'all... you seem jumpy.
No, we're fine.
We just, uh... we took a wrong
turn somewhere and got lost.
Uh, where are we?
Oh, this here is Kentucky,
my friends.
Don't you worry.
We'll get you some gas,
and you'll be on your way.
Ma'am, how's your leg?
Uh, much better.
Thank you.
Gas costs money.
Oh, shit, oh.
I left my stuff
back in the car.
Me, too.
All right. I got you.
Thank you.
- Thanks so much.
- Yep. I'll be right back.
Howdy. Y'all got gas cans?
Uh, yeah. First aisle.
Can't miss it.
I'd like to fill this up.
That's gonna be ten bucks.
All right.
187, 10-29 Frank.
Officer shot and killed in Ohio
by two assailants.
Suspects are
one young black male,
one young black female.
YBF was wounded by officer.
Suspects are said to be
armed and dangerous.
Last seen operating
white Honda Accord.
- Stop pacing.
- I can't help it.
- You look guilty.
- I am guilty.
Have you been charged
with something?
- No.
- Then you're not guilty.
Why is he staring at us
like that?
I don't know.
Do you need anything else?
Is that it?
Um...
Yeah, yeah, that's, uh...
that's it.
- Get in the driver's seat.
- Are you crazy?
I think he knows.
Oh, fuck.
Y'all gonna leave without me?
- Whoa.
- Get in the car.
Take it easy.
The fuck?
Take it easy.
Get in.
All right. All right?
I'm getting in.
My name's Edgar.
I've lived in Kentucky
all my life.
My wife died three years ago,
and I've been raising our son
all by myself.
I'm all he's got in this world.
And watching him grow up
has been
the greatest blessing
of my life.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna kill you.
Well, is it true?
Did y'all kill
that police officer?
It was self-defense.
Oh, I'm sure it was.
I've got some colleagues
who have crossed the line
more than once.
Pop the trunk.
- Why?
- Just do it.
Get in. Please.
Look, I don't know
what happened,
but whatever it was,
I'm sure you had good reason
for doing what you did.
Now, please let me help you.
What'd you do that for?
He wanted to help us.
He isn't gonna help us.
It is their job to make you
feel like everything
will be okay,
but the second you confess,
you become
property of the state.
Is that what you want?
You want to be
the state's property?
No.
Slow down.
I got it.
I'm just trying to keep us
from getting pulled over again.
I'm hungry.
Me, too.
Let's stop at McDonald's
or something.
That's disgusting.
Now ain't the time
to be choosy.
Do it again.
Ah, shit.
We ain't got no money.
Check the glove box.
- Anything?
- No.
Look at God.
- Oh!
- Ooh.
Oh, man.
- Hey!
- What you doing?
Chill. I got this.
Hey. You want to make some
money and get some free food?
What's the catch?
Ain't no catch, little man.
All right.
What y'all want?
All right, let me get
a double cheeseburger
with a ten-piece
chicken nuggets
and sweet-and-sour sauce.
And I'll have
a chicken sandwich
with no condiments
and a small fry.
You can keep the change.
Ain't gonna be that much left
after all that.
You make a lot of noise
when you eat.
Woman, this could be
my last meal.
Would you just let me be?
It's just hard for me to eat
with you making
that much noise.
I never heard of someone
not being able to eat
because they're disgusted
by the sound
of other people eating.
I know it's weird,
but I have a thing about it.
How you avoid the sounds
of people eating?
I eat alone most of the time.
That's not surprising.
You scared?
- No.
- You're lying.
How do you know?
You answered too fast.
Come on, man!
I thought,
if a person answered quickly,
that meant they were
telling the truth.
My dad always told me the
person that answers too quickly
had a lie ready to go.
Well, that's good to know.
How you know if your clients
are telling the truth?
I don't.
Then how can you defend 'em?
That's my job.
Are you a good lawyer?
Come on!
I'm an excellent lawyer.
Why do black people always
feel the need to be excellent?
Why can't we just be ourselves?
All right, go again.
We should go.
Hey.
Is this y'all?
Nah, man, that ain't us.
Wait!
My daddy want to talk to y'all.
Wait, where you going?
Fuck!
- Daddy! Daddy!
- God!
Oh, shit!
- God, nigga, watch where you're going, dawg!
- I'm sorry.
- I didn't see you coming.
- God!
You almost killed my daddy!
God, think you got my bad knee.
- Can you move it?
- You broke my daddy leg!
Stop crying like a little
bitch. I'm-a be a'ight.
Mama told you to stop
calling me a little bitch.
Nigga, I'll call you
what the fuck I want.
- We have to go now.
- Ooh.
Y'all gotta take him
to the hospital.
We can't go to a hospital.
So, I can get y'all food,
but you can't take my daddy to the hospital?
- Where's the nearest hospital?
- We don't have time for that.
- Would you calm down?
- Don't talk to me like that.
I'll talk to you however
I want to talk to you.
Y'all sound like
me and my bitch.
Don't call my mama a bitch.
Nigga, I wasn't talking
about your mama.
Come on, we're gonna take you
to the hospital.
I got plenty of hos.
Your mama ain't
the only one, too.
Shit!
Ooh. Move your fat ass.
Come on.
Fuck.
- Boy, just gonna sit there?
- Oh, God.
- All right, boy, no problem.
- Shit.
No, you enjoy it, man.
Sick and tired of you.
Oh, goddamn.
Fuck.
Damn, my knee!
- I support what y'all doing.
- What do you mean?
You killing all these
crooked-ass cops.
Need to take out
all these motherfuckers.
- That's not what we're doing.
- I've seen the tape, okay?
Shit, if a cop
shot at my bitch,
I'd have killed his ass, too.
Mm, cop killers, cop killers!
Shut the fuck up, man.
Are y'all the new
Black Panthers?
Is that what this is?
No.
- Oh, this revenge.
- For what?
For that nigga
he killed two years ago.
What?
Some dude was taking
his daughter to school,
minding his own business,
- and that cop killed him for no reason.
- Mm-hmm.
Did you know about this?
- Of course not.
- Hey.
Hey. Hey, the hospital
on the left.
Pull over. Pull over.
All right, we're here.
Y'all gonna help me
with him or not?
Nah. Nah, nah, nah.
There's probably cameras
all up and through this bitch.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on, boy.
Sorry, man.
Power to the people.
Come on, Dad.
I got you. I got you.
So, how many views did it have?
100,000.
Fuck.
How long before a helicopter
- starts flying over us?
- I don't know.
Please tell me you didn't
- fuck with that cop on purpose.
- Of course not.
See, I don't know you
like that. You could be crazy.
It should be a sin
to call a black woman crazy.
Oh, you one of
those people that think God
- is a black woman, huh?
- I don't believe in God.
Lord, help me.
- You're on "E" again.
- Fuck.
I really need you
to start paying attention
- to that shit!
- Why don't you pay attention?
You're driving!
I don't think it's smart
to be walking
into gas stations.
It's not that scary.
I already told you what to do.
Only 'cause
you don't have to do it.
You got this.
I believe in you.
Don't patronize me.
I'm not.
There's one.
The city council and the mayor
now are taking action.
They've been hammering out
an ordinance for weeks.
Now they have drafted a final
version of the legislation
that could be voted on
as early as
the next council meeting.
Now the
breaking news out of Ohio.
Just be cool.
Local PD are on
the lookout for two suspects:
an African American man
and woman,
who they say shot and killed
a police officer
during a roadside altercation.
Dashcam footage of the shooting
was released late...
Fuck.
Fuck.
Let me get f-forty
on pump nine.
Is that a Glock?
Yeah.
Can I hold it?
No, you can't.
I'll pay for your gas
if you let me hold it.
It's not a fair trade, like...
You don't let me hold it, man,
you're gonna have to stick up
another gas station.
Man, I'll kill you right now.
You don't look like
a killer to me.
What's it about holding
a deadly weapon
that just makes me
feel so alive?
What the fuck are you doing?
What you doing?
What you doing?
Hmm?
I'm just messing with you, man.
Damn, why you knock
like the police?
If you didn't throw our
phones out, we could've called.
If I didn't throw
our phones out,
the police would've
caught us by now.
Touché.
- Can I help you?
- My uncle here?
- Who's your uncle?
- Bitch, don't play with me.
He in the back.
Well, if it isn't
the black Bonnie and Clyde.
I don't know
what the news is saying,
but whatever it is,
it's not true.
Y'all hungry?
Yeah.
I'd always hoped
you'd escape this life
without getting shot at.
- Who patched you up?
- She did.
You ain't do a good job.
What's your plan?
We need to figure that out.
Y'all need to hurry up
and figure it out quick.
The police,
they like slave catchers.
They can smell a runaway
for miles.
I'm aware.
How you gonna outrun the police?
We don't have to outrun them.
We just have to make sure
they don't know where we are.
That ain't hard to do.
- Cops are dumb as shit.
- Not all of 'em.
She only say that
'cause she used to fuck
one of them motherfuckers.
Don't be jealous.
I ain't jealous of nobody.
Niggas jealous of me.
We might need to stay here
for a little while.
Oh, hell nah.
SWAT team probably
already on they way.
I don't need those
muscle-neck motherfuckers
sniffing around my shit.
So, what are we supposed to do?
I don't know.
So, you're just gonna
let us get killed?
That's the risk you take.
Fuck you, Earl.
How long you need to stay?
A night or two.
Well, which one is it?
Two nights.
Fine.
We need some cash.
How much?
Enough to last us
for a few days.
What else?
We need one of your cars.
You can kiss my black ass.
He love them cars
more than he love us.
I ain't got no extra cars
just laying around.
What about the blue Catalina?
- Goddess, shut the fuck up.
- Mm.
And it's turquoise.
I don't know
how low-key we gonna be
riding around
in a turquoise Catalina.
That's the whole point.
We'd be hiding in plain sight.
Do you agree
to my terms or not?
I ain't giving you no damn car.
You owe me.
Okay.
Go get my car keys.
Sit down.
Y'all need to figure out
what the hell
you gonna do
once you leave here.
We will.
- Youngblood.
- Hmm?
She speak for both of you?
No.
Could have fooled me.
Don't do that.
Well, I'm just trying to
understand this nigga mind.
You ask me,
he seems a little...
a little slow.
I think we should go to Cuba.
That's what I'm talking about.
Isn't that where, um, um...
- Assata Shakur went...
- Mm-hmm.
- ...after she killed that state trooper?
- Allegedly killed.
We just gotta keep driving
until we get to Miami,
- and-and then, uh...
- We'll be standing in front of
a large body of water.
How we supposed to cross that?
I don't know yet.
Of course you don't.
You got a better idea?
- Where you think you're going?
- To lay down.
I'm exhausted.
Y'all ain't going nowhere
till you shave your heads.
- We're not doing that.
- Oh, you want
to keep walking around looking
how you do in that tape?
You're not shaving my head.
Fine. You can choose.
You're a woman.
I believe in
a woman's right to choose.
But you ain't shit.
Use the cheap razor on his ass.
Man, this is fucked-up.
This what happens when you're
on the run from the law.
I didn't know Earl had a niece.
We're not close.
Who's he related to?
Your mother or your father?
- My mother.
- Mm.
She and I
weren't close, either.
Damn. Who are you close to?
Are you close to your family?
Yeah.
They don't care how I make
my money, as long as I'm happy.
- Are you?
- Sometimes.
What makes you happy?
Uh, robes at fancy hotels,
a good lace front,
and when your uncle
kisses me on the forehead.
Mm.
What?
Nothing.
I'm just surprised
by the amount of love
he has in his life.
Well, he don't always
deserve it.
He needs us to worship him.
Out there, he ain't shit.
But in here, he a king.
You like it?
I don't know yet.
You like this shit.
Shut up.
A nationwide
manhunt is underway
after a police officer
was shot and killed
during a routine traffic stop
last night in Cleveland, Ohio.
Investigators are looking
for two suspects,
one African American male
and one female,
in connection with the killing
of the officer.
Police say the suspects
fled the scene
in a white Honda Accord
and are considered to be
armed and dangerous.
Dashcam footage of the shooting
has been posted to social media
and news outlets
in an effort to track down
the suspects.
The shooting has gained
national attention
and highlighted
a racial divide...
I know you stole my pinkie ring.
Whatever, nigga.
My daddy gave me that ring.
Don't nobody care
about that fake-ass ring.
...any information
on the shooting
or the suspects,
please contact our hotline...
That's your problem.
You don't care about shit.
Oh, that's my problem?
Yeah.
That your problem.
Nigga, you're my problem.
Bitch, give my goddamn ring!
Oh, you want to get crazy?
'Cause you know I'm crazy,
and I will fuck you up.
I'm sitting here trying
to mind my business...
- Oh!
- Honest to God, nigga.
Time for you to give
my ring back.
- Oh, hell no, nigga!
- Fuck!
I'm sick and tired
of you putting
your motherfucking hands on me!
I deal with way too much
to be dealing
- with your psychotic ass!
- Here he go.
- Give me my shit, bitch!
- No, go...
- Give me my fucking ring!
- You know what?
You want me to talk to him?
- Give me my goddamn respect!
- No. We're not gonna go there.
I want my
motherfucking respect!
We're not gonna go there, Earl,
because you already...
Bitch, I will
choke you out of these braids.
Please don't.
He didn't used to be like this.
Iraq fucked him up.
I don't want to deal
with this shit.
Let's leave
first thing tomorrow.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
How is that possible?
You took somebody's life
yesterday.
I guess, um...
I'm just used to saying
that I'm okay when I'm not.
I know the feeling.
What if God wanted me to die
and I messed up his plan?
I don't think
that's what he wanted.
- How do you know?
- I just...
I just think
you were meant to be here.
I'm making
an executive decision.
- We're going to Cuba.
- "Executive decision"?
We can't leave here tomorrow
and not know where we're going.
What about
that large body of water?
We'll figure it out.
I'm scared.
That's all right.
I'll be brave enough
for the both of us.
Hey, uh...
why does your uncle owe you?
I got him out of prison once.
For what?
- He killed somebody.
- Damn. Who'd he kill?
My mother.
I'm rubbing your head
for good luck.
I don't believe in luck.
I think everything is destined.
Who the fuck called you?
I'm just here to make sure
everybody's okay.
You still fucking this nigga?
- No.
- Why the fuck he here?
- I ain't call him.
- Why the fuck you here?
A neighbor heard some commotion
and got concerned.
Oh, shit, it's the cops.
Get down. Get down.
Don't worry.
I take real good care
of my property.
Do you?
Oh, yeah.
She my biggest draw.
You got a new truck?
I don't know
who the fuck truck that is.
You mind if I come in?
Not without a warrant, nigga.
You go get
your paperwork together.
I'll give you the grand tour.
Think I will come back
with that warrant.
Make sure you use
the large font.
I can't see shit.
Keep your hands
to yourself, Earl.
I didn't want you to come here
in the first
motherfucking place.
Close the gate, nigga.
You know I'm gonna have to kill
that nigga one day, yeah?
Y'all need to get the fuck
out of here.
Shit.
There's clothes in the closet.
Oh, shit.
Take this.
That should cover your gas
for most of the way.
And the man at that address
will take care of you.
His wife ain't shit,
but he cool.
Johnny Shepherd?
Who's he?
We served together.
I saved his life once.
He'll be expecting you.
And he got a friend
that got a plane
to get you over
that body of water.
Thank you, Uncle Earl.
Nigga, I ain't your uncle.
Mm.
- Take care of yourself.
- You, too.
Take care of her.
Love you, baby girl.
Love you, too.
It's beautiful out here.
Is it?
I'm just trying
to make conversation.
I'm just being honest.
Oh. You have to be honest
all the time?
- Do you want me to be silent?
- I didn't say that.
What you doing?
I'm gonna try
and get some sleep.
What are you doing?
- Are you crazy?
- I heard a band playing.
I wanted to see
where it was coming from.
We need to keep going.
I mean, I know,
but I'm exhausted.
Plus, you knocked out
in the back while I'm trying
- to stay awake.
- Fine. I'll drive.
When was the last time
you heard some live music?
I don't know.
I mean, we're only
a few hours from Georgia,
so we got time.
Would you have gone
on a second date with me?
- No.
- Damn.
It's not personal.
I just like being alone.
I get it.
What would the second date
have been?
I'm not telling you.
Come on.
Don't do me like that.
Nah. You should've said yes.
Okay, fine. I'll go.
It's too late now.
I have the right
to change my mind.
Okay, I'm officially saying yes
to the second date.
Now, what are we doing?
I'm taking you dancing.
Let's go.
Can we dance when we get
to where we're going?
- Just to be safe?
- I'm tired of playing it safe.
You're willing to risk
getting caught so we can dance?
Hell yeah.
One dance, and we can leave.
I promise.
I'll buy you a drink.
Yeah. Come on.
You good?
Let's go.
We got to get a move on.

What do you want?
I want a guy
to show me myself.
I want him to love me so deeply
I'm not afraid to show him
how ugly I can be.
I want him to show me scars
I never knew I had.
But I don't want him
to make them go away.
I want him to hold my hand
while I nurse them myself.
And I want him to cherish
the bruises they leave behind.
We should go.
What do you want?
I want a ride-or-die.
Oh, my God.
What does that even mean?
I just want someone
that's always gonna love me
no matter what.
Someone that's gonna hold
my hand and never let it go.
She got to be special, though.
'Cause she gonna be my legacy.
What do you mean?
Look, I ain't gonna
bend the world.
Long as my lady
remembers me fondly,
that's all I need.
Skinny Luther or fat Luther?
Mm, skinny Luther.
- Oh, fuck.
- What?
See, I don't trust people
that like skinny Luther.
Skinny Luther was dope.
He had a lot more energy,
he sang better,
and his clothes fit.
You crazy as hell.
Fat Luther was the shit.
Look, who else you know
that can pull off a Jheri curl
and a three-piece suit
at the same damn time?
Nobody.
What you doing? I thought
you said no more stopping.
I changed my mind.
What you mean, you changed
your mind? We got to go.
Relax.
Oh, f...
Hey. He's gonna get scared
and kick you in the face.
They're not wild.
Well, how you know?
My uncle used to take me
horseback riding
when I was a kid.
Really?
He told me nothing scares
a white man more
than seeing a black man
on a horse.
Why?
'Cause they have to
look up at him.
I never been on a horse.
You should try sometime.
Maybe I should do it right now.
You should try it
when we have more time.
- I'll take you.
- When?
I don't know.
What if you don't make it?
- We will.
- You don't know that.
I'm getting on a horse.
Come on.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Yeah, climb up on this side.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Got it?
That's right.
Yeah.
All right, hold on.
You got it?
It's nice, isn't it?
Yeah.
Hey!
- Shit. Shit.
- What are you doing?
Let's go. Let's go.
Get the fuck off my property!
Go, go, go, go, go, go.
- Motherfuck.
- Damn.
Oh...
I think I saw a body shop
somewhere back there.
Hell, that was a while ago.
Well, we need to get
the car fixed.
All right, get in the car. I'll push.
Your radiator's fucked.
- Your water pump, too.
- That don't sound good.
I can probably get it
back to you tomorrow
- for about two grand.
- Two grand?
- We need it back today.
- Y'all in a rush?
Yeah, we're... we're on our way
to visit family.
Now, why y'all want to rush
to do that?
Well, I can probably
get it back for you tonight,
but it's gonna cost you
a little more.
How much more?
Another 500.
Come here. Come on.
That's all our money.
What's the alternative?
I ain't got all day.
We gonna do this or what?
Here. That's all we have.
Need the car fixed
as soon as possible.
I'll work as fast as I can.
Can I use your bathroom?
Yeah.
It's right in through there.
Hello?
Dad?
Are you okay, boy?
Yeah, I'm fine.
This ain't like you.
I know.
I just want to let you know
that I'm okay...
...and that I love you.
I love you, too, son.
We're trying to get to...
Now, why would you do that?
Get out of my house.
You're under arrest
for helping a fugitive.
You do what you got to do.
Oh, we're gonna find him.
Yeah, but not with my help.
What you about to do now?
Oh, damn it!
Y'all are working on my nerves.
Why don't you go
take a walk or something?
We're not leaving you
with this car.
Don't nobody want
to steal your car.
Well, I just want to make sure.
Man, you got
bigger problems than me.
You know who we are?
I'm old, boy, not blind.
Then why didn't you
give us a discount?
'Cause, unlike the rest
of these simple-ass niggas,
I don't approve
of what y'all did.
We didn't have a choice.
That don't matter.
You gave them
a license to kill us.
He shot at me.
- You gave him an excuse.
- You weren't there.
No, I wasn't.
But if I was, I would've took
my ticket and been on my way.
Can you work more
and talk less?
I could work a lot faster
if you left me the fuck alone.
I'm not leaving you
with this car.
Damn! This is bullshit.
What about if I give you
some insurance?
I don't want no house keys
or no driver's license,
'cause all of that
can be replaced.
Son.
Yes, sir?
How'd you like to take
these nice folks on a walk?
Yeah.
Um...
Yes, sir.
You keep 'em occupied
till I finish this car.
Stay off the street.
I'm, uh...
I know who you are.
What's your name?
Everybody call me Junior.
Hi.
It's an honor to meet y'all.
Going to a protest tomorrow.
- For what?
- To support you.
Can't believe
y'all are here, man.
I was just watching y'all,
like, like, on TV, and then...
now you walking
right next to me.
That shit is crazy.
Really hope y'all make it.
Yeah, me, too.
Just know, even if
you don't, it'll be okay.
How so?
'Cause then you'll be immortal.
I like that.
I'd rather live.
I want to be immortal, too.
You're too young to be
- worried about all that.
- No, I'm not.
I could die today.
Don't say that.
I just want people
to know I was here.
As long as your family
knows you were here,
that's all that matters.
Yo, Junior.
Could you take our picture?
Yeah.
I don't think
that's a good idea.
Come on.
I want proof we were here.
Right here.
Yo.
Yo.
Do you mind
if we make a detour?
Uh, I do, actually.
You okay?
Not really.
We were close
when I was younger.
But as I got older,
I felt like...
I didn't know her anymore.
She didn't know me, either.
We could go months
without talking.
And when we did, I hated it.
I had nothing to say to her.
She wanted a connection
so badly.
And I just didn't care.
I didn't need her anymore.
My grandmother
left the house to both of them.
My mom wanted to sell it.
My uncle wanted to live in it.
Typical family bullshit.
Mm-hmm.
One night, they were
up at the house, fighting.
He was really fucked-up.
He pushed her.
She fell down a flight
of stairs, cracked her skull.
She bled out so quick,
by the time
the ambulance got there,
she was already dead.
I had just passed the bar.
I was desperate
to try my first case. I...
I never thought
that that would be it.
How could you defend the person
that killed your own mother?
I knew it was an accident.
Does it ever piss you off
that he's alive and she isn't?
All the time.
Let them go! Let them go!
Stop shooting us!
- Stop shooting us!
- Not one more!
Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go!
Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go!
- Stay back.
- Stand back.
Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go!
- Let them go!
- We got to fight the power, man!
Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go!
Let them go!
Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go!
Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go! Let them go!
Get back. Please, back.
Stop killing me!
Stop killing me!
Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!
Stop resisting! Stop!
Let's go!
Come on!
I'm ready.
Come fucking shoot me!
Come on!
Come get me!
You need to get out of here.
If you don't vacate
the premises,
- I will arrest you, son.
- I'm not your son.
- What's your name, young man?
- I ain't got to tell you that.
Listen, I'm not trying
to hurt you.
I'm just trying to clear
these streets and do my job.
You're not supposed to be here.
Okay, so what you gonna do?
You gonna shoot me?
You gonna shoot me
if I don't leave?
No, but I will arrest you.
Listen, man, I'm begging you.
Just go home, all right?
What you...
And a young man was killed.
His father came out
and said he fixed your car.
What do you mean, he was killed?
He shot
a police officer in the face.
We were just with him.
You knew the boy?
We spent some time
with him, but...
Did you order him to do it?
- Are you crazy?
- We would never do that.
Well, these kids,
they think it's okay
to kill cops 'cause of you.
Uh, who made it okay
for cops to kill us?
We didn't want this.
There's a war going on
out there,
and you welcome this
into our home?
They didn't start it.
I want them gone by the morning.
We can leave right now.
Hey, hey.
Don't let your pride
get you killed.
I ain't staying here.
Look, I got hiding spots
all over this place.
Even if the cops come,
they won't find you.
This is a safe place.
Right?
Y'all hungry?
Come on.
There's a bounty out
on your heads.
How much we worth?
- 250.
- Total?
- Each.
- That ain't much.
It's enough to pay
our mortgage off.
- You gonna turn us in?
- No.
Earl told me you need a plane.
Yeah.
I know a guy in Florida.
Already gave him a call.
This is his address
and directions to his house.
If you lose that, you're fucked.
Let's eat before it gets cold.
I'll lead us in prayer.
May I?
Course.
I'd like to start
by thanking God
for the breath in my lungs.
I'm grateful that we have
a place to sleep tonight,
food to put in our bellies.
Thank you for bringing us
this far.
Thank you for this journey.
No matter how it ends.
Amen.
Amen.
Get upstairs now.
- What's going on?
- Just go.
Get under the bed in our room.
Take the back stairs.
It's not here. It's not here.
Police! Police!
- Hands on the table!
- Here.
Tell us where they're at!
Living room clear!
- May I help you?
- Hands on the table!
- Tell us where they are.
- Upstairs!
Who's "they"?
Go, go.
Right side clear.
Closet clear.
Clear!
You tell us where they went,
we'll let you go,
and you can enjoy
the rest of your evening.
How can I tell you where they
went if they were never here?
Then where'd the fancy car
come from?
People park their cars
around here all the time.
You look a lot smarter
than your husband.
You want to tell me
where they went?
Sergeant.
We have to
leave here at some point.
I'm not trying to walk
into an ambush.
I heard cars leave hours ago.
I'm sure they left
some folks behind
to keep an eye on the house.
You can stay here and die
of starvation if you want to,
but I'm getting the fuck
out of here.
They got to be out front.
We got to jump.
I mean, it's too high.
What you got to do
is bend your knees
when you hit the ground, okay?
Bend and roll.
This ain't no damn fire drill.
All right, right.
Hold on, hold on.
Be careful. Careful.
Okay.
Fuck.
All right?
We... we need to move.
We need to move.
I'm gonna need you to get up.
I'm gonna need you to get up,
all right?
Lean on me. Lean on me.
Lean on me. Lean on me.
Almost there. Stay here.
I'm-a check out front. Okay?
Sit down here. Sit down here.
Sit down here.
Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.
Okay, I know how to do this,
but you got to promise
not to scream.
Can you do that?
I believe in you. Hmm?
I think there are cops
out front.
If they hear you,
it's over, we're done.
I know how strong you are.
You can do this. Yeah?
Wait. Give me your jacket.
Here. Take that.
All right.
All right.
All right. Okay.
All right.
One.
Two.
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. Okay.
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
Sounds like somebody's crying.
No. That's just nature.
City boys ain't
used to that shit.
Don't refer to me as "boy."
I ain't no boy.
- You know what I meant.
- I know the difference
between a person
and an animal, too.
Then go walk around.
Better watch
how you talk to me, man.
Ooh, touchy, touchy.
- I need to find a screwdriver.
- You know how to boost a car?
I used to. My older brother
taught me one summer.
Toolbox.
Only car we ever stole
was my dad's.
He should've known better
than to leave that Acura
around us.
Damn it. Fuck.
Now, how we supposed
to get out of here?
What was it?
Couple deer
caught in some branches.
I set 'em free.
Told you.
Yo, what you doing?
Are you crazy?
Get back in the car.
F-Fuck.
Are you trying to die?
No. I just always wanted
to do that.
Well, don't do it
while I'm driving, okay?
- You should try it.
- Nah, I'm good.
- Pull over.
- Nuh-uh.
Come on, pull over.
Pull over.
If I do it, will you please
let me drive
the rest of the way in peace?
Swear to God.
Swear on something
you believe in.
Okay, fine.
I'll swear on you.
Fuck, man.
Shit.
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!
Man, fuck it.
I'm coming back in.
Oh, no, no, no. You got it.
You got it. You're good.
I'll just drive slow.
Are you sure this is the place?
Will you please get back
in the car before you get shot?
Ain't nobody here.
I was hoping we'd pull up
to a house and get some sleep.
Well, there isn't one.
I can see that.
- They're gonna find us.
- No, they're not.
How about you get in the back
and get some sleep?
I'll sit here. Huh?
Make sure nobody kills us.
Take that.
Thanks.
I can't sleep.
You want me to turn on
the radio?
No.
I want you to tell me a story.
What kind of story?
Any story. I don't care.
When I was little, I asked
my mom where babies come from.
She said I was
too young to know.
Then I asked my dad.
And he said, "Babies are
a product of two people
that needed something
from each other."
So I said, "Needed what?"
He said, "Maybe they needed
to feel seen.
"Maybe they needed
to feel loved.
Maybe they needed
to feel human."
And then what?
Then I asked my grandmother.
She said babies come from God.
They're his way of making sure
no one ever really dies.
I remember her saying,
"Through our children,
we are reborn."
Then I went
to my older brother,
and I asked him.
And he said,
"Nobody knows.
You're just born.
That's it.
Now, leave me alone."
I wasn't satisfied with
that answer, either, but...
I ran out of
family members to ask,
so he got the last word.
So, who was right?
None of 'em.
Babies come from fucking.
Plain and simple.
Why y'all acting
all scared and shit?
'Cause you pointing a gun
in my face.
Man, I was just fucking
with you, player.
Come on.
You know the Shepherds?
Hell yeah.
Hey, come on, man.
Let's go.
How we know you ain't lying?
I mean, you don't.
Then why should we go with you?
What other choice do you have?
Well, how you know
the Shepherds?
- From way back.
- How long?
Damn, man, why you giving me
the third degree?
I'm trying to help you out.
- They said you had a plane.
- Oh, they lied about that one.
Well, if you ain't got a plane,
we not going with you.
Look, man,
I ain't got that kind of money.
But I got a friend that do.
He a baller. He can get you
whatever you want.
When we get to my trailer,
I'll give him a call for you.
Why can't you call him
right now?
'Cause I ain't got
my phone on me.
Damn.
Look, y'all can either
roll with me
or stand here like some dummies
and wait for the police
to come get you.
Yeah, all right, for sure.
All right, I got you.
Yeah, for sure.
I'll see you then.
All right, he gonna have
the plane ready to go
first thing tomorrow morning.
We can't wait till tomorrow.
We got to go now.
Damn, y'all some
bossy motherfuckers.
Call him back.
All right, man. Back up.
Hey, sorry, bro. They trippin'.
Uh, they say they got to go
today, nigga.
That's what I told 'em.
All right.
Bet.
Said meet him in an hour.
All right, cool.
Hey, yo,
what the fuck is y'all doing?
It's an hour away.
We got to go.
Y'all want to hit this shit?
I don't smoke.
Word?
What about you, sis?
I'm good.
Shit.
If I was y'all, I'd be smoking
like a motherfucker right now.
That why I be smoking
all the time.
I'm paranoid as fuck.
I always think
somebody trying to kill me.
Like who?
Shit, the police,
niggas, everybody.
That's no way to live.
What you gonna do?
Yeah.
Hey, I'm glad
I met y'all, though.
So are we, man.
Yeah, y'all...
y'all really gave niggas
something to believe in.
We needed that, for real.
Yo, let me hit that.
I knew you wanted
to hit that shit.
Yeah.
Yeah. Live your life, sis.
There that nigga go right there.
Thank you.
Stop. You're under arrest!
Get on the ground now!
I am not gonna say it again.
Get on the ground!
I'll never let go of your hand.
Get on the ground!
If I had a chance...
...I would've kissed
all your scars.
I know you would have.
You're under arrest.
Get on the ground!
I'm not gonna say it again.
Get on the ground now.
You're under arrest.
Can I be your legacy?
You already are.
Hold your fire!
Stand down!
Let me see your hands!
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!
Step away from the girl!
Stand down right now!
Stay down!
Show me your hands!
Don't! Don't do it!
Put the girl down!
Stop right there!
Do you hear me?
Do not take another step.
Take another step,
and we will shoot.
Angela Johnson and Ernest Hines
were shot and killed today
by Monroe County Police.
The two suspects
have become quite infamous
for their ability to escape
authorities across state lines
after killing Officer Reed
in Cleveland, Ohio.
Monroe County Police Department
released a statement
saying they had hoped
to arrest the suspects
so that they could have
their day in court,
but they had no choice
but to open fire
because the suspects were armed
and considered dangerous.
It was a tragic ending to
a six-day nationwide manhunt.
The pursuit that began in Ohio
ended on a Florida tarmac,
yards away from a jet plane
intended to be
their final escape.
Despite the two
being wanted for murder,
hundreds of thousands of people
across the nation
pledged their support,
gathering in the streets,
protesting against
the fallen officer
who shot and killed
an unarmed black man
just two years ago
in an unrelated incident.
Johnson and Hines became
a social media phenomenon,
even inciting violence
against another police officer.
Dashcam footage links them
to the shooting death
of an officer.
What if God wanted me to die
and I messed up his plan?
I don't think
that's what he wanted.
How do you know?
I just think
you were meant to be here.
Thank you
for bringing us this far.
Thank you for this journey.
No matter how it ends.
