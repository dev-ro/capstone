- Go for it.
- Just do it.
Fuck.
Oh, my. Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh.
Oh.
I think she has her period.
Camille, go to the bathroom
and check it.
It's not my period.
Just saying, yo.
I think she's, like...
she's bleeding.
It looked
the blood was rushing down.
Still okay?
Your mother is a whore.
Oh.
Your mother is a whore.
Oh.
How did it go?
What do you mean?
They just took out the stitches.
I mean,
did it hurt or anything?
No, it took like two seconds.
No more skating.
Promise me.
Mom.
No!
What are you talking about?
All right, fine. All right.
I promise.
Just stuff.
You wanna get
the fuck out of the way?
Hey! What's up?
Hi.
What's your name?
- Camille.
- Are you from here?
Janay, Janay,
Janay, Janay.
That girl just fingered me
in the bushes, bro.
Oh, my gosh!
What is wrong with you.
She just put her fingers
in my pussy.
- Not right now!
- Come on, give me a dab.
No. This is Camille.
- Hi.
- Hi. You look familiar.
I follow you on Instagram, bro!
Yo, I follow her on Instagram.
She's mad good.
Aren't you, like,
from New Jersey or something?
Long Island.
Oh, that's the same shit
to me bro.
It's not in New York City.
Oh, this is Ruby.
- Yeah, that's Ruby.
- Hi.
She keeps her hand
on her camera.
She gonna catch a clip,
Long Island?
Come on, Long Island,
let's get a clip!
- I'll try
- Kurt: You'll try? Cool.
Let's get it, first try. Go, go!
Damn.
Too many penises in the way.
That was good, though.
Oh, shit.
Ah. Again!
That shit was valid!
Oh, nice!
First try.
Hey, can you do an ollie?
No, bro, I'm a poser.
That's why I have this shit.
I thought this was just
an accessory.
- It's my purse.
- That's your bag.
Yeah, that's my bag.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Ruby.
Indigo, this Camille.
She hit us up on the 'gram.
Cool.
The good part's coming.

Where you going?
Have fun.
Fuck yeah, bitch!
Fuck yeah, bitch!
Oh, yeah?
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
I just came here
to skate.
I'm about to leave to go meet
the girls. You should come.
- Okay. Yeah.
- Let's go.
- Give me your board,
- Kurt: Yo, just hop over! Damn.
I'm good.
They don't have weed
in Long Island?
I mean, New Jersey,
I mean, Long Island.
Damn,
it's so chill here.
But I get so sick of this city.
I just wanna go to, like,
the fucking mountains
and make artwork, ceramics.
Nobody can fucking find me.
I'm swaying.
You know the show
Sex in the City?
- Yes.
- No, you don't.
You watch the show
Sex and the City, bitch.
What are you talking about?
Okay, listen!
- What are you talking about?
- Yo, you're too high!
You're too high.
No, I'm not, I know
what the fuck I'm talking about.
No, you don't!
Kit Kats and Sex and the City,
and also, the motherfucking
Monopoly man. Okay?
What's wrong
with the Monopoly man?
That motherfucker...
doesn't have
a fucking monocle anymore.
He's always had a monocle.
Exactly, and now it's gone.
It's because...
a lot of people have noticed
these certain things
that is different than it was
a couple years ago.
People think that we entered
a different dimension,
a dimension that looks
so similar to the other one.
So, that we wouldn't notice.
Except for certain little
things that changed.
Okay, it's called
the Mandela Effect, right?
Nelson Mandela.
The biggest one that fucked
people up in the head
is that a lot of people...
remember hearing
about Nelson Mandela
dying in the '80s
- when he was in jail.
- Hey, Mom.
If you look on Google,
Nelson Mandela died in 2013.
Yeah, I'm at the library.
That's fucking fucked.
I'll be home soon.
I got a little delayed.
I'm leaving now.
All right. Bye.
Oh my God.
Let's do, like, a chain.
Camille, grab your stuff.
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Everything okay?
Yeah, I just told her
I was at the library.
What?
So, you just keep, like,
old photos
to like, send to her.
Yeah, you guys don't do that?
- With your parents?
- No. That's different.
It's the same photo
every time too, I don't...
Well, we're all going back
to my place if you wanna come.
I have to go home.
I really can't.
Okay.
Oh, you don't hug?
Not really.
That's okay,
Ruby doesn't either.
Okay. Um, I'll see you guys
another time, then.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Little bitch!
Oh.
Make a wish.
When did you bake this?
Last night
after you went to bed.
And I didn't put any eggs in it.
I thought we can go
shopping together.
I want to get you a gift.
No, you don't have to spend
your money.
I mean it's okay, it's fine.
We can get you
some new clothes.
And I mean...
- Mom, please.
- You're such a beautiful girl.
- If you take...
- Mom, stop!
For a while...
I was feeling really lonely
and...
it's like...
that loneliness
you... you have...
even if you're in a crowded room
with people smiling
and laughing and...
that emptiness,
I was just feeling it
for so long.
But um...
I don't feel it anymore.
Does it taste like
outdoor-grown weed?
Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey!
- Hey, Lawrence!
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey, girls.
- What's up?
- Hey.
- How you doing?
- Hey.
- How's everybody?
- Hi, Dad.
Hey,
what's up, Camille?
All right, who's hungry?
- Me!
- Oh, yes.
- Alright.
- Please make your lasagna.
Lasagna?
- Yes. Please.
- Okay, lasagna?
Any food.
- Any food?
- Just make food.
It sounds like lasagna it is.
- Yeah.
- Lasagna cool with you, Camille?
Yeah, yeah.
Thank you. See you later.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thank you.
Janay, your dad's so cool.
Like, it smells like mad weed
in here
and he didn't even say anything.
I know. I don't know why
he doesn't say anything.
Does he, like,
buy you everything?
Like, does he, like,
buy you tampons?
Yeah. Yeah, when I ask him to.
That's dope.
That's mad cool.
I just send him a picture
of like what I want
and he's like, "Okay, got it."
- That's a good dad.
- Yeah.
- You use tampons?
- Yeah, sometimes.
You don't?
Can't they kill you?
- No.
- What?
Like, your leg can fall off
but you won't die.
Where'd you learn that?
Oh my God. No. Ruby.
- I heard about it.
- You won't die from just using
a tampon, otherwise the whole country
would not use tampons.
Yeah, baby,
don't use tampons you're gonna...
- The whole world.
- ...have a river in your pants.
Like, would you rather be overflowing
with blood or nicely plugged up?
- Exactly.
- I use tampons.
They work for me.
Still have my legs.
For now.
Are you guys
on your period right now.
- Just finished.
- Yeah, I'm about to start.
- 'Bout to get it.
- I have to go
to the gynecologist
and I'm, like, so nervous.
like I don't know, I feel like
they're just gonna be like,
"Why does it look like that?"
And I'm just like,
- What?
- ..."I don't know."
It is your vagina?
Yes, I just feel like
they're gonna be like...
But they look at pussy all day,
that's their job.
Look, I don't know,
I just feel like
mine is just extra weird
and I'm just like...
I'm just scared.
I'm just oh, my God.
Look, I know you've probably
seen way more vaginas
than I have.
Can you just take a look?
You want me to look
at your vagina?
- Yes. Okay.
- Okay.
- Oh, my...
- Okay.
Y'all ridiculous.
Is that okay?
- It's perfect.
It's valid.
- Are you sure? Okay.
- You're good. Yes.
Okay,
Janay has a valid vagina.
- Great.
- Good job. Congratulations!
Amazing. Phenomenal.
I had to go
to the gynecologist
- not too long ago myself.
- Word?
I was skating
at this park in Long Island
and I was hitting this set.
But something happened
and the board just...
I just messed up and I ended up
sitting on the board
and it cut me down there.
- You got credit carded?
- Yes.
Oh, my gosh.
I was just pouring blood.
Dude, that's so scary.
That's like
the scariest thing ever.
I've always feared that.
Like you're really tough
for that.
Like, that's crazy.
Everyone thought
it was my period.
- All the boys were like,
- Janay: Oh, my God.
- ..."Is that your period?"
- Yo, boys are just...
uneducated sometimes.
I'm sorry.
Not all boys, but some boys.
Just...
- ridiculous.
- Yeah.
Wait, do you have a type?
- Type?
- Like, of... of... like,
- of other people.
- Sexual preference?
Sexual cuisine.
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, what's your type?
- The dickhead type, bro.
- Right!
Every boy that Janay
has been with
- has been a fucking asshole.
- Shut the fuck up, no.
- True.
- Smelly-ass boys.
Can you guys shut up? No.
That's not...
No, seriously,
come on. Answer the question.
Like, what's your type?
Why do you guys wanna know?
I don't know, I just...
Dude, it's a simple question,
do you like dick or pussy?
- I like...
- Do you like sucking dick
- or eating pussy?
- Stop.
Okay, I like boys, okay?
I like boys but...
- Yeah...
- I like pussy.
Nice pussy.
Fuck!
Mom, just relax. Chill.
I'm fucking 18. I do shit.
I'm 18 now.
Why? Is your boyfriend here?
I said lower your voice.
You were skating.
Your mom took your board?
Yeah.
- Damn.
- Why'd she take your board?
Yo, come on.
I'm gonna get you a board.
- Man, I've seen some mom shit.
- Really?
- True, yeah. Yo.
- How?
Yo,
one of you guys have a board?
- What happened?
- Do one of you guys have a board?
- No, I'm sorry.
- Who's is this?
- Who's is this?
- Why are you fucking with my shit?
Can she just have this one?
Her mom was being an asshole.
Chill, don't fuck with my
shit. Put that back
before I make you do it myself.
- Take your fucking board.
- All right, bye-bye.
Yo!
Yo!
I got an extra board.
- Really?
- Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah.
What? For me?
I got you. Hell, yeah.
I just wanna see you
keep on shredding, like, honestly.
- Yo, thank you, Charlie.
- No problem.
Hey, here you go. A hug. Great.
Maybe four means love.
My bad.
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, you can juggle?
Is there a third wheel?
Oh, no.
You just gotta hammer it
sometimes.
- Hey! Hey, you guys.
- Yo! Yo!
Alright.
Setting up this board.
Yeah, we just set up a freshy.

Hey.
Hi.
Is she always like that?
I don't know, I mean...
I've only been living with her
for like five years, so...
Why?
She's whatever. Like...
hard to be around sometimes.
So, when the courts asked
who I wanted to live with,
I chose him.
Damn.
Yeah, once a year,
I was supposed to see her
during Christmas to, you know,
exchange me.
But... every time we would go,
I would just sit in the car
and I'd see her
through the glass,
sitting, waiting for me.
But I just couldn't get out.
I'd... I would just sit there
and...
my dad would have to go in
and be like,
"Oh, Camille doesn't want
to see you."
And so, we'd just leave.
That's a lot.
Yeah, once I turned 11,
I started, like... changing,
physically.
I used to stand
in front of the mirror
and punch myself in the chest
because I didn't...
I didn't want to grow breasts.
It was horrifying 'cause...
I was always, you know,
dressing in boys' clothes and...
playing football,
and hanging out with my dad.
And when I noticed that
I wasn't going to be like that
forever and that
I was growing up,
it was super embarrassing
because he didn't...
he didn't notice,
he didn't understand.
Uh...
So, one year that year, I...
on Christmas, I decided, like,
I needed to see her.
I needed to go.
It's not even like I wanted to.
I needed a mother.
But I went and...
I just started spending
more time with her.
Eventually,
after a couple of weeks,
I felt like maybe
I should stay with her,
start living there and...
Uh, my dad was just
super jealous.
He didn't think that...
I'd ever...
leave him.
And I wasn't trying
to leave him but...
I didn't wanna leave him,
I just...
He just wasn't...
Now we don't talk anymore
and...
and I feel so bad
because I didn't want him
to feel like
I didn't want him anymore.
It's just I...
needed a mom at that time,
and, like...
I totally understand.
Like I... I totally understand
what you're going through
and it sucks
and I don't want you
to beat yourself up about it.
Yo, come on.
We have to get to LES before
all the assholes get there.
Skate or die, bitch.
What the fuck?
Yo, we out to the back.
Yo, back the fuck off, son!
How about you teach
your little girlfriend here
how to actually fucking skate
and not look cute
like everybody else.
- Yo, dawg, hey, hey.
- Yo, you wish you could
fuck a girl this beautiful.
Yeah, right, that's not
what your mom said last night
when I fucked her!
What the fuck?
What the fuck did you just say?
Fucking bitch!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Don't touch my board, bitch!
- Fuck them, fuck them.
- Give me that shit!
Get off my fucking skateboard!
Get off my fucking skateboard!
Get off my fucking skateboard!
Give me my fucking skate...
So, then you're gonna press this
to void a purchase
but then you're gonna need
a manager to swipe.
And people are gonna be all up
in your face
talking about coupons
but if they're expired,
they're expired, okay?
That's just policy.
Okay.
Like, people get crazy.
- About coupons?
- People get violent.
You wanna take that
to the stockroom for me?
Oh, yeah. Where is it at?
Right there. It says "stockroom"
right there. Andale.
Lana said to bring this
to the stockroom.
Yeah, you can just leave it
right there.
Yo, where's your...
where's your posse at?
Don't you guys travel
in a squad?
Huh?
Your rowdy-ass girl crew,
where they at?
Very funny.
Oh, I hate this job.
- What's up?
- Hi.
Dude, that dickhead
works here too?
Yeah, um, why do you guys
hate him so much?
He's just an asshole, bro.
That one looked perfect,
guys!
Camille, where you at?
Camille hiding. Y'all ready?
Everybody in this?
Oh, you blocking people.
What the fuck is your face?
What the fuck?
The train is coming!
Oh yes.
How did I wake up with scratches
on my body and you wake up
with scratches on your body
in your bed
when I told you the night before
"Take me home.
I'm not feeling good.
Take me home."
And he's just like, "Nah!
It's just you were into it."
And I was like, "No.
It looks like I tried
to fuck you up, which means
something is wrong."
- And like, everybody's...
- They always play it like
it's the girl who's bugging out
but it's not true.
He's calling me crazy
and I know...
- Yeah.
- ...I'm not bugging.
That's so fucked up, bro.
Everybody always just believes
what the boy says.
And then
they'll call you crazy
and you get upset
because you know
- you're not wilding out.
- Yeah.
and it makes you feel
even like you are crazy.
What's that...
what's that shit called?
- Yeah, gaslighting.
- Gaslighting.
- I fucking hate that.
- Recently,
I was with some guy
and we were over
by McCarren chilling
and earlier in the day
everything was fine but one time
we were just chilling on the bench
and he starts putting my hand on his
dick right there. And I was like,
"What the fuck are you doing?"
It was suss as fuck.
He took your hand
- and put it on his dick?
- Yeah.
Gross.
That's so fucked up, bro.
Nah, I'ma start doing
that shit though.
- To boys?
- Just like...
Yeah, just bring their hand
right here and be like,
"Yo, daddy, what's up?"
- Word.
- Just, like, feminism.
Yeah, word.
Yo, fuck them, bro.
Looks valid up there.
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, yo.
No, we're not ready.
- We're not ready?
- Camille's not ready.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Do this.
- Yeah.
Give her the old razzle dazzle.
Come on, let's go!
As long as it doesn't change me.
Nah, for real, like,
it looks really good.

You guys,
if you were to smoke
with any famous person
that died, who would it be?
I mean, he's not dead
but I would smoke
with my homey Kevin Bradley.
Off the bat, I'd just rather
smoke with my friends.
Nah, I would...
I would wanna smoke
with Michael Jackson.
Michael Jackson?
That's a good one.
You think he was a stoner?
- Yo, imagine.
- He definitely smoked.
- He was a stoner.
- He definitely smoked.
You can't be that wild
and not smoke bud.
He's so cool.
This guy told me that
Jimi Hendrix used to put...
cut slits in his forehead
and put tabs of acid
in his slits and hide it
under his bandana, yes.
- What do you mean...
- Put tabs of acid,
- yeah, like
- ..."cut slits"?
And then he would just
trip balls
- while he was playing.
- He'd be all talking bleeding.
No, just little slits.
Just little ones.
- That sucks.
- Ah, scary.
You did acid before?
- With Jimi Hendrix.
- No, you didn't.
I was kidding
- but I felt like...
- Poor Jimi
I was like, "I feel his soul,"
I was deadass tripping balls.
Like, it was lit.
What flavor is this?
Tastes nice.
- It's weed flavor.
- Taste like...
- It's weed flavor, yeah!
- No, no.
I would say grape.
Probably like, black widow.
Tastes like banana.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
No.
It actually tastes like...
- Grape?

You guys know

We ain't stuck like glue
or nothing.
Okay.
Yo, I seen you at the park
the other day shredding.
You were killing it.
Thanks.
Hey, um...
what's your favorite color?
Red.
Is that why you turned
your hair red?
Yeah.
Nice.
See, I like yellow
but if I tried to turn
my hair yellow,
it would just look blonde
and I don't... I don't think,
I don't know...
blonde wouldn't be cool.
a good look but yeah.
But yeah, I'm gonna go inside.
Good-bye.
Fuck it,
that shit was wild.
Imagine if somebody
just came and wall-rided this shit.
I've been planning this
for weeks!
Come on, don't slack on me
like this.
Yo, let me call you back.
Yo, Camille!
Yo, Camille!
All right, so, I was supposed
to do this photography shoot
with my homey
but he slacked on me.
Are you trying to pull up?
'Cause I really wanna get this.
Me?
Thirty minutes tops.
Well, no, I... I would
but I can't tonight.
Maybe another time.
I'm so down for another time.
Okay?
All right.
- All right, next time.
- Sorry.
I think it'd be cool
if I... I stood on the board.
Huh?
I'm gonna try to skate up here.
Yo, you wilding.
Ready?
I'm gonna do a trick.
- Are you a deadass?
- I'm an ollie.
Hold on.
Devon
All right, go ahead.
Holy shit.
Let me get a couple more.
That was a little sketchy.
I'ma try to kick flip it.
All right, go.
Does it look good?
Wait, wait. I can go higher.
So, you just come up here
on roofs, look down at people?
Sometimes.
Everything looks
so different.
You know, you're the only girl
I've ever brought up here.
Really?
Yeah.
But you're cool.
Yeah, all right,
yeah. I don't know.
It's, like, is it a thing
where you pop first
and then flick,
or is it one motion?
Yeah, you have to pop.
I don't know, it depends.
I think about it...
I think about it
I was like, as I pop,
I'm flicking and turning.
I think of it as doing a 180
and then like,
just adding the flick in there,
you know?
See, but you do
that whole thing
- where like...
- I just pivot.
Yeah, you do, like...
I feel like you make it
a two-part thing.
Yeah.
Yo, check this trick out
that I learned the other day
- from my friend.
- So funny.
Stop it! Don't do this.
- I know, I know, I know.
- You don't want it!
Hey, look out
that backflip!
Yo, what the fuck is that...
Yo, why you guys snaking us?
Yo, can we even, like,
dead ass skate, bro?
We trying to skate, bro.
We were here first.
No, you're not gonna let
a girl drop in?
What's wrong
with the kiddie bowl over there?
What the fuck?
Yo, you guys suck mad dick!
Yo, Kurt, why are you
always talking mad shit?
- Because you're always acting
- Why?
like a dickhead!
Get out of here!
Fuck you, son.
Just relax.
Just relax, bro. Just relax.
- Bam. That's it.
- Oh, shit.
Like, if you don't care about
getting...
You just go for it.
I don't know.
I feel like the best like,
a lot of good skaters,
they like do not think.
No that's you can't think,
that's the thing.
And us girls, we think too much.
- I cannot do that.
- Yes, you can.
Like, I could
but I like my life.
Once boys hit puberty,
they just get really good.
I don't know. You notice that?
Eh, no.
I don't pay that much attention
to this shit.
Wow,
is that in Midtown?
Yeah.
I wanna go there.
That's, like
by Bryant Park.
You rolling, bro?
You guys haven't taken me there.
We should go.
I think that might be a little
much.
What do you mean?
I mean,
I just don't think
all of the girls
would wanna do that.
But you wanna
stand out, right?
Yeah, I want us all
to stand out, like I wanna...
So then
we should just go hard.
It'll be fun.
I've seen you do things
way bigger at skate parks.
I know you can do it.
It turns into a five-stair
but it's just a four-stair
at the beginning.
It should be fine.
- You got it.
- Let's do it.
- Come on, you got it.
- Nah, I don't know.
Damn. Damn.
Come on, you got it.
Just try it again. Come on.
All right, firecracker,
let's go.
- Yeah, Janay!
- Oh, fuck!
Oh, fuck!
- What's hurting?
- Fucking ankles.
Are you okay?
Just take
a deep breath.
Just breathe.
Do you need help?
No, no. It's okay.
I got it.
Who is that?
Oh, my God.
Don't even worry
about your mom right now.
She's...
You're gonna be valid
in a couple of weeks
and we'll be skating
and you'll think back
to this day
and it'll just be a thing
that happened.
I guess.
What's wrong?
Sprains take a couple of weeks.
Really and before you know it,
we'll be skating
and going to LES and back it.
It's gonna go by fast.
Just stay up.
Come on!
Come on.
You sure?
It'll make you feel better.
I got this from Kurt.
Don't tell her I took it.
Come on.
Let's watch some TV
or something.
Put your foot, like...
put it like closer to here.
I don't wanna step
on your fingers.
- It's okay.
- Okay. Like that?
Yeah. And then like try and like
just go as like fast as you can
and just shove it onto the left.
Try and go fast.
That was pretty close.
You just have to go faster.
Yo, what's up?
You girls want a bev?
- I'm good.
- Good.
Get me, like, Fiji water,
nice snacks.
- Hmm.
- Alright. Cool.
Hola.
So...
Hi, Camille.
How are you guys?
What do you mean?
You know,
how are you guys doing?
Patrick?
Yeah, you like him, don't you?
I like how he gives me head.
All right, so, then like
when do you know...
How do you know
you like them?
What do you mean?
How do you know
if you like a guy?
You just know.
You get a feeling.
It happens.
How do you know
when they like you?
Why are you asking me
so many questions?
You like someone.
No, I don't.
Who do you like?
- What's his name?
- I don't like anyone.
- You like someone.
- No, I... no I don't.
I'm being really serious.
Even though I'm smiling I swear.
- Whatever.
- But Janay and that dude
what's up with them?
Like, the dude at the party.
Are they togeth...
Are they, like a thing?
They were, like
all over each other.
Nah, he didn't mean anything
to her.
Not like Devon did.
Devon. How?
- They were...
- They had a thing,
like on and off for years.
And she just...
she can't get over it.
He's a dick.
- Damn.
- Yeah.
He's an asshole.
I wish she would.
But it's whatever.
Your fucking foot
looks like my tie-dye, bro.
- That's crazy.
- I know.
That's a sign
that it's healing though.
- It's the same color as her board.
- Yeah, really?
Are you icing it?
Um, kind of like
you're not supposed to ice it
for too long but like yeah,
I've been icing it.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
So what else
have you been doing?
- Just chilling this.
- Yo.
Yo,
what the fuck is that?
This is Tony Alva.
He's my animal therapy rat.
- Why is he here?
- Because
- he's supposed to help you.
- No can you please...
- No, please.
- He's chill.
I really don't like rats.
Please!
- You're scared of him?
- Yes!
- He's smaller than you.
- Yeah.
He's really cool.
You would like him if...
And what the fuck?
He's like shitting
- on the floor. Can you get...
- He's just an animal.
He's just an animal.
He's supposed to shit.
All right, Kurt,
let's just bring Tony
somewhere else. All right?
Yeah.
Bye, Janay.
- You sure?
- No, no, no.
Stop!
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Come on, Kurt.
I tried to link you.
You get my text?
Yeah, sorry I didn't get back.
I was...
No issues.
I'm about to go sack some clips
with the boys up at Midtown.
You trying to pull up?
Hmm. Yeah, I'm down.
- Yo, what up?
- There you are, bro.
- What's good, bro?
- Hey, yo, Dev, who's this?
- It's Camille.

'Aight, yo, make sure

Oh, shit.

Let's go!
Let's get these clips!
Yeah.
Oh, yeah!
Yo, stop right now!

Just this last one guys.
Just get that.
Get that right quick.
- Did you just...
- Yo. Yo! Yo, yo, yo!
- Hey, back off.
- Sir, sir.
I let him borrow my board.
That's my board.
Can I just please have
the board back?
I didn't know we weren't allowed
to skate here.
- You know this is private property.
- No, I didn't.
- Listen.
- I really didn't.
And he was just using my board...
- This is our job, all right?
- Alright.
I totally understand that
but can I just please have
the board back?
I'm not trying to fight you
or... or be disrespectful
like them.
I'm just trying to get
the board back. Please?
Take this board, right?
Come on.
- I just let him borrow it.
- Take the board...
And get the fuck

Wait,
what videos did you see?
I watched, like,
every single video you posted.
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.
- What's up?
- Hey, what's up?
Nothing.
What's up
with your home girl Janay?
I haven't seen her shred
in a minute.
Yeah, no, she actually fell
super hard the other day
and sprained her ankle.
No way. Is she gonna be okay?
Yeah, she's good.
She just rolled her ankle
really bad.
So, she's just been kind
of like house-locked.
- Ah.
- Yeah.
Sucks.
So, what have you
been doing all day?
This.
Come on,
don't look like that.
Cheer up. It's summer.
Yeah,
and I'm in the house.
I like how it pointed
this way...
I'm gonna head out to the park,
so I'll see you, okay?
All right.
So, what happened with you
and her?
She couldn't handle us
being just friends,
so I had to cut it off.
Ah.
We still cool.
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi.
Janay, let me see this ankle.
The swelling's down.
See?
- Still purple.
- Progress. Progress.
Chin up.
Get out the way, pigeon!
Oh, shit.
Yo, that was mad close.
Yo, bro,
I'm about to fuck this girl,
bro.
Oh, my God,
she's so fucking fine, bro.
Like, bro, her ass is like round
as shit.
Yeah, you a thot,
that's what.
I'm not a thot, bro.
I'm just... I'm a man
who likes women, bro.
I love beautiful, smart women.
I love beautiful, smart women.
They be nice to be around.
Curly hair, big lips,
thick as fuck.
My God, man.
They're just dope.
I'm trying to not listen,
but I hear it.
Like, she invited me
to her own crib.
I didn't even have to invite her
to my apartment dude.
Like I was just like, "Wow."
She gave me some buns!
Oh, really?
Some hot dope buns.
It was like God's vagina.
Dude.
Did you just say "God's vagina"?
That's where we...
That's where we...
So, God's a girl, right?
- Come on.
- God is a girl.
- Oh, yeah.
- God's definitely a girl.
She was fine!
I can't stop.
I can't get over it, bro.
- I can't get enough of the girl.
- What's her name?
Her name is Tez.
She's valid.
- Where's she from?
- I don't know.
I just met the girl,
she was dancing on me,
then I fell in love, dude.
- Me first?
- You gotta land it first.
Oh, okay, cool.
Oh, back you up!
I got you!
I don't know what I'm gonna do
if I can't skate anymore.
Like, that's my whole life.
Like, you know that,
that's all I do.
Come on,
you're gonna be able
to skate soon and, Janay,
skating isn't your whole life.
You're still you with
or without your board, okay?
Why do you sound
like Devon? Oh, my God.
He used to say, like, deep shit
like that, like,
all spiritual and stuff
and I'm just like...
It's not... it's not you.
It's just like...
he really messed me up.
Yeah!
Nice.
Hit that shit.
You just gotta, put your
foot out more and catch it, you know?
Like, here, watch.
Watch my front foot.
Oh, my God.
Watch your front foot.
I hit a rock.
That doesn't count.
Ow.
More towards
the beginning, like...
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.
Your homegirl's over there
- and she is faded.
- What?
She needs some help.
Well, yeah, she's flattened out.
Yo, Eliza, Eliza. Hey.
What the fuck did you do
to her?
We was just trying to get lit.
- That's it.
- Devon, what the fuck?
She's obviously
not good.
- Nah. No one's trying to violate.
- Go away.
- Go away, Juan.
- Dude, I thought it was...
No, I don't care.
- Devon!
- Yo, bro, bro,
- let's just clear.
- All right, whatever.
- Leave.
- Whatever.
Thank you.
I told her
it was on some next-level shit.
She can't handle it,
so whatever.
Yo, your friends can be real
assholes sometimes,
you know that, right?
Yeah, yeah, I know.
What's going on
with you and Devon?
No, not now.
- Are you fucking him?
- No, God!
We work at the same place.
That's all.
- Does Janay know?
- No, she doesn't, but...
Why haven't you told her?
You need to tell her.
You need to tell her.
I will, I will.
Come on.
Oh, my God,
you should see that clip, bro.
- Janay!
- Hi.
- We missed you.
- Hi, Janay.
Hey, Janay. You're alive!
- I know!
- And walking and outside!
Hi. Ew, you're sweaty.
- Come, let's skate.
- We're out here workin' hard.
- Get on the board.
- Please don't kill me.
No,
you have to lean that way.
Yeah.
Watch out for the side!
Oh, my gosh!
Oh! Ah, shit.
Oh, no! Oh!
- Are you okay?
- Indigo, what did you do?
I'm only trying to kill her
a little bit.
I don't wanna do this
anymore.
Okay.
Well, I'll still roll you back.
She was just good again
and you fucked her up again.
You know, butt-ass naked
running around SoHo
'cause I ain't have
no fucking clothes.
- So, we had to call somebody.
- Mm.
But we didn't have phones,
right.
So, we had to be on the computer
like, Facebook
messaging people to come get us
and open the door and shit,
- like...
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- What? What's wrong?
- What the fuck?
- Hello.
- What happened?
Janay! Janay!
Janay!
- Janay, what happened?
- Camille!
- What's up?
- What the fuck is this?
Are you fucking kidding me?
This is you staying late
at work?
Janay, I... no,
I was going...
I'm over here waiting for you
to text me back and shit
and you're fucking around
with Devon?
- Are you kidding me?
- I was gonna tell you.
- I just, like...
- But you didn't!
I wanted to tell you.
You didn't tell me shit!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Indigo knew.
Don't be bringing me
into your bullshit.
It was not like that, Janay.
It was not how she said.
- I told her no.
- So, I'm the only idiot here, right?
- Janay.
- I'm guessing you knew, too.
- Listen.
- Bitch, I didn't know shit!
She kept this shit to herself,
bro.
She did this by herself,
on the low.
Janay,
you were all depressed.
- Don't fucking touch me!
- You were all depressed in your bed.
- I didn't know how to tell you...
- That's not an excuse.
I don't want... what is wrong
with you? Why would you do that?
You're supposed to be my friend!
I am your friend.
No, friends don't go and fuck
their friend's boyfriends!
I didn't fuck him.
We were just taking photos
and skating
and that's all we did.
So, you're skating with him
now too?
- Of all the boys...
- You fucked up.
...you chose him?
I'm trying so hard
to like not punch you
in your face right now.
Why were you skating with them?
Why not? I'm just skating!
Like...
- you don't own me.
- It's not just skating!
What is it then?
You fucking tell me!
You were with him!
- It was just skating.
- Were you sucking his dick
while you were on the roof
with him or some shit?
Are you fucking
kidding me? No.
If you want to skate with whoever
the fuck you want to skate with,
then get the fuck out of here!
You're such a fucking
shitty friend.
- Fuck you guys.
- Just leave. Just go.
Don't fucking touch me.
Shut the fuck up!
Back the fuck up!
- How could you fucking touch me.
- Chill, chill.
- Indigo. Go. Go.
- Fucking touch me!
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
You wanna...
you wanna fight?
- No, get the fuck out of here.
- That's all you can do, right?
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Leave bitch.
- Whatever.
- You fucking whore.
Your mother's a whore!
Your mom is fucking dirty,
you dumb bitch.
Fuck you.
God.
- Deadass.
- You got this!
Yo, what's going on?
Is it cool if Camille chills
for a bit?
Yeah, it's fine.
She can chill over there.
You can chill right here.
I don't even know this kid.
Yo all gonna have to wake up.
We got a nice crib!
We pay rent and all that.
Camille how are you doing?
Next time you come, make sure
you bring your mom with you,
all right? I'm a MILF-er.
I'm a MILF-er.
Nah
but I've fucked a MILF before.
Nah! Nah! Nah, yeah,
that shit is crazy.
Nah, I'm deadass.
So, you know I be chilling
at the bar right over
around the corner.
So, I was chilling
around the corner, right?
Real facts.
I been chilling,
this girl comes up to me.
- She's like, you know, 25.
- That's not a MILF.
Nah, this... nah. Yeah, nah.
Swear on... I swear on anything.
I swear on anything.
I swear on anything.
All right,
let me tell the story!
- All right, let him rock.
- Tell us, tell us.
All right, so, I'm chilling
at the bar
and this chick just comes up to me.
She's like, "Can I buy you a drink?"
And she's wasted.
And I'm just like, "All right."
She buys me the drink,
we're chilling.
She's, like...
she goes in to just kiss me,
right like I've been talking
to this chick
for like two minutes.
I kid you not.
She buys me a drink,
I'm drinking the drink.
She turns around,
she tries to kiss me.
I'm like, yo,
I don't know who she is,
so I like... kinda just like...
skirt it.
And then she... she was like
"Oh you... And she was like
"Are you gay?"
And I was like... "What?"
She was like...
I forgot how it went but like
- somehow she was like...
- You had it!
No, okay. No, no, no, no!
- Nah, nah, nah.
- No, no no.
My son...
I had this... nah, nah, nah.
That fucking actual MILF
though, bro.
- Definitely not.
- Definitely not.
Yo, she was like,
sugar mama type.
I would pull up to the crib.
- You're, like, 15, nigga.
- She was 38...
she was 38 and she had two kids
and she treated me right, bro.
All I need
is once chance.
- Baby oil everywhere.
- All I need is one night.
Yo guys, I'm done,
don't be playing me.
Don't be playing me, son.
Who's gonna spit,

- That shit is fire.
- That shit is killing it.
- That's totally fire.
All right, skate video.
Relax.

- Skate video time.
Yo. Oh, I gotta...
- Can't even read my Thrasher.
- Yo, I need the bud.
Welcome.
Oh.
You read this?
Yeah.
My mom loves him.
Yeah?
Yeah, when I was younger,
she got me a copy,
but it's in Spanish.
It's easy to be crazy
about love in Spanish.
You can leave your shit,
like, under there.
Probably safer.
We got a bed for you
in the living room.
Okay.
And the female
is so resourceful,
as she sits there,
she plucks down
from her own breast
to create this big blanket.
When she leaves,
she'll sometimes
pull this blanket back over the
eggs to keep them warm.
From the outside, it looks a
lot like a teenager's bedroom,
