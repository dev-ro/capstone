 With Mother Love Bone,
 you had some success,
 and there was a tragedy there.
 And what made you decide
 not to continue with Mother Love Bone
 and to form something
 totally different?
 Because it was old at that time,
 and we wanted to do something new.
 So this is what
 we're doing now, new and fresh.
 And then they saw me in a bra,
 and that was it.
 And they said,
 ''We've got to have him.''
 That was before his front
 tooth got knocked out.
 And l have a weather report
 for you people,
 and it's not a good one.
 KCMU. Seattle's rockin' report.
 What is it that drives
 thousands of young angelic-faced boys
 in our calm, tree-lined suburbs
 to spend their allowances
 on Marshall Amplifiers?
 Why is this happening?
 Truth be told, there's always
 been a great scene in Seattle.
 lf you want some crisp, aggressive,
 and emotional rock-and-roll,
 then get on down to The Off Ramp
 on Friday, July 5th.
 Wowwee!
 You haven't seen anything yet.
 My name is Cameron Crowe,
 and l was a rock journalist
 when l first moved to Seattle
 in the mid-'80s.
 l became aware of a whole
 scene of musicians
 that really worked together to create
 their own world of influences
 and bands and community.
 l immediately realized
 how much this was different
 from the places l grew up in
 and the music l listened to
 in Southern California.
 This was music that came from guys
 that stayed indoors a lot.
 They had a lot of time to play
 and a lot of time to listen.
 And they listened to everything,
 hard rock, hair metal, glam,
 R&B, soul, disco, blues,
 all of it cuisinarted together
 into this majestic mix
 of great, melodic, hard rock.
 We'd go and see the shows
 that got put on by The U-Men,
 and we'd go see these guys,
 and these guys would come see us.
 Sometimes we would open
 for these guys.
 So it was like us, we play.
 Two guys who l met early on
 were Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament.
 They'd been in a well-known
 local band, Green River,
 and had an obvious bond
 that drew a lot of people to them.
 On any given night in Seattle,
 it wasn't hard to run into
 Stone and Jeff
 going out
 to listen to some live music.
 Let's do
 a little more of an intimate thing.
 Sit with me. Sit with me, my child.
 Those people over there,
 police officers. Wave at them.
 How you doing?
 This is not MTV, but it very well
 could be at any time.
 Sarcastic police officers. Excellent.
 We're supposed to get in
 to see The Cult tonight,
 but so far, nobody's showed up.
 We finally got into the show.
 We were outside for a long time
 and they wouldn't let us in
 but we got these things,
 backstage passes.
 How come you didn't come out
 and give me my pass earlier?
 l was outside for so long.
 We were outside for a long time,
 and here is my witnesses right here.
 Because you never believe me.
 You never believe me, Stone.
 You never fucking believe me.
 l knew when l met Stone,
 l couldn't imagine
 hanging out with the guy.
 Mark Arm introduced me to him,
 and within five to 30 seconds,
 l think he wanted to punch me.
 l had recently been introduced
 into the exciting world of sarcasm,
 and so that, to me,
 was the greatest joy
 anyone could ever have.
 Out here...
 Rock people of all sorts,
 Susan Silver, Chris Cornell,
 Jeff Ament.
 We had a bit of
 a chip on our shoulder.
 We always felt, l think,
 like, if it came from New York
 or Chicago or Minneapolis or Athens,
 it was probably better,
 but there also was
 this attitude of
 somehow we will persevere.
 lt was very different
 from Los Angeles'
 or New York's band scenes.
 There were tens of groups in Seattle,
 but they all knew each other,
 and everybody was talking about
 Jeff and Stone's new band,
 Mother Love Bone,
 and their amazing
 charismatic front man.
 His name was Andy Wood.
 l want the world to know
 that Mother Love Bone is coming
 to take over the world,
 a plethora of delights,
 a fruit salad compote of delights.
 He was a fantastic entertainer.
 People loved him.
 l mean, people loved to see him
 do his thing.
 He was very funny.
 He would do something
 like go to The Central Tavern
 when there was 25 people there.
 He'd play it like it was a coliseum.
 ''To all you people in the back!''
 And there's, like, two...
 There's the guy at the door.
 He was a rock star. He knew it.
 And something about that...
 l'll speak for everyone...
 Made us believe that we were, too.
 l want to get
 on an arena tour with some band.
 Who cares? Warrant, for that matter.
 What the hell?
 Go on tour with Warrant.
 Just so we can play arenas.
 That's the kind of crowd l like.
 There's an easy crowd.
 You can say anything.
 You can say,
 ''Your mother smells bad, people!''
 And they'll just go, ''Yeah! Yeah!''
 There are certain people
 you just know that you love,
 and you'll do anything for them.
 You just wanted him
 to be a rock star.
 You just saw it and were like,
 ''l'm on your team.
 ''l want to be anywhere near you.''
 We're going down to L.A.
 on Monday to record an album.
 Do you think you're
 the band of the '90s?
 Do you think you're gonna be
 one of the forerunners?
 l think so. l hope so.
 l mean,
 l thought l always would be involved
 in the band of the '90s.
 So if we're not the band of the '90s,
 l'm gonna fire my band
 and get a new one,
 and then they'll be
 the band of the '90s.
 'Cause you know what was weird?
 Like, l was listening
 to the bottom end of all the songs,
 'cause l was kind of worried
 about Stardog, you know,
 and the bottom end of it...
 The first guy that l called
 to see if he wanted to be
 my roommate was Stone Gossard.
 He was living at home, l think,
 and he answered the phone,
 and he's like,
 ''Yeah, no, l'm good.
 l don't really want to...
 ''l don't really want to change
 my living situation right now.''
 And he was at home, so l thought
 that was a little weird.
 But l thought,
 ''Whatever. That's great.''
 And he said,
 ''But Andy just got out of rehab,
 ''and he might need a place.''
 And l thought,
 ''Well, that would be cool.''
 You know, l didn't really know him,
 but l thought,
 that would be interesting.
 He seems like an interesting guy.
 lt would be cool.
 l called Andy up, and he's like,
 ''Sure. l'm coming over.''
 Chris and Andy
 had a very deep relationship.
 l know that both of them had 4-tracks
 set up in their bedrooms,
 and they would each try
 to record a song a day
 and play it for the other guy.
 He just had a freedom.
 He didn't edit anything that he did,
 anything that he wrote.
 He didn't care. He just charged
 through the creative process
 without a care in the world,
 and l was the opposite,
 overanalyzing, and...
 lt was just
 a really exciting creative time.
 Thank you so much.
 As long as l've known the guy,
 there's always been different times
 where he wasn't comfortable
 with himself,
 and his using drugs
 was a product of that, too.
 lf you know any addicts,
 you know that, you know,
 just because they quit
 for three months doesn't mean shit,
 and he was someone who definitely had
 a certain tragic flaw.
 That's where his greatness came from.
 We knew that
 he was trying to be sober,
 and we knew that he was really...
 That he couldn't just sustain...
 You know, you can't just...
 You can't...
 You can't really be a junkie
 and be super-productive and, like...
 l mean, maybe somebody can,
 but he wasn't going to be able
 to do it.
 That morning, like, March 19th, 1990,
 there was, like,
 five messages from Xana,
 Andy's girlfriend at the time,
 saying... You know, just hysterical.
 We all got in a taxi
 and went up to Harborview,
 and he was on life support
 at that point,
 and it was a fucking trip.
 l mean, it was, like,
 the worst, most horrible...
 lt was confusing, you know.
 lt was, like,
 ''Andy O.D.'ed and he's not dead,
 ''but he's not gonna live,
 but he's not dead,
 ''and you've got to come now.''
 Whenever people would start
 to get into drugs after that,
 l'd always... l always thought, like,
 l wish l had a picture of Andy
 when he was in the hospital,
 because it was... lt was so horrible.
 He was... They kept him alive
 for a couple of days.
 l think mostly just so
 family and friends
 could say good-bye
 or whatever, but...
 lt was... lt was horrible.
 lt's difficult to articulate it,
 but, it's...
 You know, up to that point,
 l think life was really good for us
 as a...
 Just a group of musicians in a scene,
 making music.
 lt just... You know,
 the world was sort of our oyster,
 and we had support,
 we supported each other.
 And he was kind of like
 this beam of light
 sort of above it all,
 and to see him hooked up to machines,
 that was the...
 l think the death of the innocence
 of the scene.
 lt wasn't later
 when people surmised that...
 That Kurt blowing his head off
 was the end of the innocence.
 lt didn't... lt was that.
 lt was walking into that room.
 So at this point, l think everyone
 really wants to take a break,
 for one,
 and just kind of let things happen
 naturally to a certain extent
 to see where we want to go with it,
 you know.
 We're not in any huge rush
 to be rock stars at this point.
 And Andy's attitudes and personality
 were such an integral part
 of Mother Love Bone
 that, you know, there's just...
 You wouldn't be able to replace him.
 lt's just not,
 in our minds at least, it just...
 Fiddle with it.
 What? You just lost all sound?
 Check.
 Hello. Hello. Hello.
 ln some ways, l was just thinking
 about this
 in the last couple of days,
 that l can relate to
 the Clippers and the Nets
 because... l've kind of...
 l feel like my musical career
 has kind of been that way,
 in that every time that it seems
 like it's starting to take off,
 somebody goes down with an injury
 or the coach gets fired
 or something happens.
 l remember Jeff saying,
 ''Maybe l'm not supposed to
 be doing this.
 ''You know, that was my shot,
 and it's gone.''
 l think if my dad and l hadn't had
 such a contentious relationship
 at that point,
 l probably would have left Seattle.
 l never felt like giving up.
 You know, l think l was writing
 songs days later probably,
 you know, playing my guitar
 and still just going,
 ''l love playing my guitar.''
 l ended up playing
 with a really good friend of mine
 in town named Mike McCready.
 We got together,
 and we started playing
 in his parents' attic.
 That's when l had the conversation,
 ''We've got to get Jeff Ament
 in the band.''
 Jeff was playing
 with some other folks
 and l think having a good time
 doing that,
 and my first instinct was like,
 ''l don't know.''
 l remember him just saying,
 ''Fuck Jeff Ament,''
 or something like that,
 and l was kind of shocked.
 Like, ''Dude, that's your guy.
 ''You've been with this guy forever.''
 But Mike was like,
 ''No, you've got to.''
 And l was like, ''Okay.''
 And then Jeff was there,
 and l was like, ''Yes.''
 We went in and did a demo
 pretty quickly after that
 with Matt Cameron.
 And l was like,
 ''What are you guys gonna do with it?''
 And they were like, ''We're
 just trying to get a singer.''
 l was working a security job
 in San Diego.
 l was just, like, writing music
 in my living room
 for the longest time, you know.
 This instrumental tape,
 it migrated to me,
 then it really started
 bringing out some emotions
 that l hadn't touched on in a while.
 lt just...
 this natural thing came out,
 and all l did was record it.
 l surfed in P.B.
 one morning after work
 and went and recorded it,
 like, literally
 with the sand still on my feet
 and stuff
 and just sent it up that day.
 This is where Jeff Ament...
 His apartment was.
 This is the place where l came over
 after he called me
 and said, ''l got this demo from...
 Back from Ed,
 ''back from Eddie,
 ''and you should come over
 and check it out.
 ''lt's good.''
 lt was a voice on a tape
 that blew my mind.
 lt was kind of,
 ''Who is this? ls this real?''
 l really remember thinking that,
 like, ''ls this a real guy?''
 ''Who is this guy?''
 Here, in fact, is the Momma Son tape.
 This is it, huh?
 That is the tape.
 Crazy.
 l remember listening to music.
 l remember thinking about his voice.
 l heard a person in there,
 like a real person.
 l didn't hear a person trying
 to sound like another person.
 l heard a guy. l hadn't met him,
 but he's in there.
 And lookit. lt has...
 There's my phone number on it.
 l'll call the number later
 and see if l can find a younger you.
 Tell him to be careful.
 Hold on. Hold on, my friend.
 Hi. l'm Eddie Vedder.
 ln Seattle, l feel like
 l'm kind of the new kid, and...
 l'll be a new kid for a while.
 We flew Ed up,
 and we hung out for about a week
 and worked on these songs
 in the basement of
 Galleria Potatohead.
 lt's just nice to walk in that room,
 and you smell raw materials,
 you smell paint.
 There's this whole feeling of,
 like, creativity.
 You hear the pound of your footsteps
 as you go down this basement,
 and you just go in and light it up.
 l remember right before he got
 on the plane to come down,
 he said, ''When l get there,
 l want you to pick me up,
 ''and l want to go straight
 to the practice studio
 ''and l don't want to fuck around.
 ''l just want to plug in
 the instruments and get at it.''
 The music that sprouted
 right off the bat
 was pretty heartfelt and deep,
 and before we knew it,
 we all spent five days rehearsing.
 The sixth day,
 we played a fucking show.
 We thought it was just insane
 that we were playing a show
 after being together
 for five or six days, yeah. Totally.
 Let's talk about the show
 at The Moore.
 The hidden Eddie Vedder.
 Where was he?
 He was frightened. He was terrified.
 lt was a bit hard for me
 at the beginning,
 coming up and being part
 of a different place
 and a different scene,
 and it wasn't just a neutral zone.
 lt was their zone.
 He was really coming from
 a different place
 that l didn't...
 l didn't fully understand.
 And l felt like he's good,
 and then once l met him
 and saw how personable he was
 and, like, excited and not fucked-up
 and you know, just like a guy that
 we sent him music,
 and literally, like, two weeks later,
 we had music back.
 And that it wasn't Mother Love Bone.
 That was big.
 You know, we had gotten a few tapes,
 and they were all, like,
 Andy kind of tribute things,
 and it was all like whoa...
 l think it took me years
 to understand Eddie.
 My dad... He passed away
 before l knew he was my dad, right?
 So l grew up with this dad
 l thought was my dad,
 and then l found out later
 that he wasn't
 and that the guy who was my dad
 had already passed, like,
 a few years earlier, man.
 There's only two chords to this song.
 lt'll probably be really boring
 on an acoustic.
 You know, looking back,
 l realize, like,
 we all got together in that room
 at that time,
 and you know,
 l was still thinking about stuff
 with, like,
 my dad and loss and all that,
 and then
 what they were thinking about,
 having been through the situation
 with Andy and everything, so...
 ln ways we were strangers,
 but we were coming from
 a similar place.
 And all that kind of came out
 in the first batch of songs.
 Release was kind of a drone jam
 that we were messing around with
 in the basement
 the first week that Ed came up,
 and it was one of those songs
 that he just started singing
 over the top of it,
 and these words came out of him.
 l remember the first time
 that we played that song,
 right at the end of it, l remember
 he sort of ran away
 and ran around the corner.
 l was thinking about my dad,
 and then afterwards,
 it got me all tore up,
 and l went in the little hallway,
 and then Jeff came out
 and said, you know, ''You okay?''
 So this one here,
 this is, l don't know
 if you've ever seen this.
 This is my dad.
 l met him a few times,
 but he was just, like, a friend
 of the family or something.
 Edward Louis Severson lll.
 When l was born, that was my name.
 So he kind of...
 He's up there for me.
 Like, he's up in the ether somewhere.
 l feel him sometimes.
 The camaraderie and
 the healthy competition part
 l found later was unusual,
 and it was Johnny Ramone
 that actually
 pointed that out to me later,
 talking about, l think,
 you know, the friendship
 you saw between Pearl Jam
 and Soundgarden, for example,
 and saying,
 ''l've never seen that before.
 ''New York wasn't like that.
 We hate each other.
 ''We would screw each other up
 at every turn.
 ''lf you could, you would
 mess the other band up.''
 The best thing about it is,
 l think, that...
 You learn from each other,
 you know, and you...
 You're inspired by each other.
 For me,
 Temple of the Dog grew out of that.
 After Andy passed,
 Chris just wrote these songs.
 We were going to record it with,
 you know,
 the surviving members of
 Mother Love Bone.
 lt was a fun record
 that no one had any expectations for,
 so nobody worried about it,
 and that made it
 feel very fresh
 from beginning to end.
 For him to write songs
 and then have the idea
 of sharing those songs
 with Jeff and l was just, like,
 another generous gesture
 that said, ''l'm not only gonna
 help you guys with this record,
 ''but l'm gonna even ask
 your new singer,
 ''who he just is kind of
 a shy, quiet guy,
 ''because l haven't really
 heard his voice yet.
 ''l kind of saw you guys live,
 ''and you know, maybe he can sing.
 l'm not sure.''
 And then you hear it, and you go,
 ''Our guy sings
 really fucking good, too.''
 Eddie was very shy at the beginning.
 He was very kind of self-conscious.
 He's wasn't fully comfortable,
 l think...
 Until him and Cornell
 went out one night.
 He really embraced Eddie
 when he first moved up here,
 and sometimes l wonder
 if that was a void that he felt
 from Andy's passing,
 having another
 equally talented singer
 that he could sort of
 bounce ideas off of
 or just basically relate to.
 l know Eddie felt a real mentorship,
 and l think that gave him
 a lot of confidence.
 lt was the first time
 l ever heard myself on a real record.
 So it could be one of
 my favorite songs that...
 That l've ever been on,
 or the most meaningful.
 Where's Stone Gossard
 when we need him?
 Where is Stone? My God.
 We went up to Vancouver
 to open for Alice in Chains.
 Played at this place called
 The Town Pump.
 During the song Breath,
 security was taking out
 some kid, some drunk guy.
 They were being overly aggressive.
 They were really taking this guy out,
 and Ed noticed that, was watching it.
 And you could just see
 this change come over him.
 This guy that had been shy,
 that people didn't really know,
 he didn't know us, all of a sudden
 his voice changes,
 his attitude changes.
 lt just got really intense.
 You got a problem.
 Here we are in the studio.
 They're known as
 Mookie Blaylock, but...
 Not anymore.
 We had some legal problems.
 Yeah, the name was taken
 by this guy named Mookie Blaylock.
 Mookie Blaylock and Michael Jordan.
 Look at that. They played yesterday.
 The Bulls won, victorious.
 So the new name is Pearl Jam.
 We're not
 gonna cultivate anything today.
 Okay. So Pearl Jam, the new name.
 And you guys have a lot
 of other stuff going on,
 almost as we speak.
 Yeah. We're going in
 the studio tomorrow
 to make our first album.
 l was selling merchandise
 at that time,
 and you know, you can only take
 so much stuff into Canada.
 Everything we brought,
 you know, l brought
 based on kind of what we'd been
 selling up to that point.
 That night, before the opening band
 was even done playing,
 l had sold out of everything,
 stickers, T-shirts.
 Anything that we brought across
 was gone.
 l had nothing to do
 for the rest of the night.
 So l grabbed my camera
 and filmed the whole show.
 They were breaking.
 Things were taking off.
 That's our CD.
 See, l hate holding up a CD.
 l want to hold up an album.
 You can barely see this.
 Our band is doing 10 times as well
 as l ever thought we would.
 We're getting to play shows
 almost every day.
 You know, we're happy.
 So the band's chemistry
 seems really good right now.
 Yeah. Yeah. Very much a family.
 What is, you know, being
 on the road, being touring,
 what is the strangest thing
 that has happened to you?
 Right here.
 l'd like to thank D'arcy
 from the Smashing Pumpkins
 for letting me borrow her wardrobe.
 l think she looks a little better
 in it than you do, though.
 We showed up in Zurich, Switzerland,
 and the venue was almost like
 a kind of an art house.
 The stage is, like, about as big
 as our drum riser.
 We're like, ''What are we gonna do?''
 We'd been playing enough
 at that point
 that we were kind of ready
 to change something up.
 And we asked the local guys,
 ''ls there a chance
 ''that you could get us
 some acoustic instruments?
 ''Maybe we could just do
 kind of an acoustic show.''
 And we'd never done that before.
 And then it was the next day,
 somebody called
 and asked about ''MTV Unplugged.''
 So we said, ''Yeah, we could do that.''
 Yeah. We just did it. Yeah.
 Yeah.
 lt's a true story,
 something that l really felt
 and l still feel
 every time l sing it.
 A lot of your songs
 are sort of on the dark side.
 ls there any reason for that,
 or is that just mostly
 what you see, or...
 My emotions.
 lt seems like l should be
 even really happy right now.
 You know, l get to, like, play shows.
 lt's been amazing, but the fact is,
 it's like my emotions are like
 a quarter flipped in the air.
 lt's just like black and white,
 you know, good and bad,
 constantly, and you know,
 maybe by talking
 about things that may be
 a little darker
 or more, you know, on the
 negative side of our existence,
 by dealing with them,
 maybe that's where
 l find my happiness.
 The folks at MTV said
 they thought that was
 one of the best ''Unpluggeds.''
 ls it nice
 to get that kind of response,
 especially when it's
 a stripped-down...
 l don't trust nobody,
 especially when they say
 something good.
 lf l even see you having fun,
 you will be promptly arrested
 and led away.
 Fuck security.
 Yeah!
 That was when Ten
 was completely blowing up.
 They played at 3:00 in the afternoon.
 They were, like, the second group.
 But the frenzy during their set
 got more and more extreme
 as the tour went on.
 And it was all a whirlwind,
 because we went from vans
 to playing little clubs
 to a little bit bigger clubs,
 and then we get in ''Lollapalooza,''
 and then you have everything blow up.
 l remember not being able to sleep
 for entire nights after the show
 because you'd be so buzzed.
 l finally figured out years later
 that if l took a bath,
 that sometimes put me to sleep.
 ls it like you can...
 Like you're just walking
 down the street one day
 and all of a sudden you feel like
 you're getting a lot more exposure
 by a lot more people
 coming up to you?
 Like, l'm just wondering, like,
 when would you start noticing
 that all of a sudden, you know,
 your millions,
 millions of people are, like...
 Yeah, exactly.
 That would be weird.
 That would be weird.
 We try not to think about that
 as much as we can.
 We try not to think about that
 as much as we can.
 Think about that sentence
 for a while, America.
 Think about it.
 Back on the ''Headbangers Ball''
 with Eddie and Mike
 of the band Pearl Jam.
 The album is called Ten.
 Why is it called Ten?
 Actually, that's back to
 Mookie Blaylock.
 That's his number.
 lt's total dedication to Mookie.
 Now, we're about to play
 your video for Alive.
 Did you like making the video, or...
 That was the thing.
 We didn't make a video.
 We said we just wanted to play live.
 There's no way,
 with a song like that,
 which talks about
 living for the moment,
 that we're going to, like,
 lip-synch something
 that we had recorded
 a few months ago.
 l wonder what they're going to
 do for another video
 if we ever have to do one,
 because all we ever want to do
 is live.
 Really? You can't see yourself
 ever making some sort of conceptual
 video or anything like that?
 Roll sound. Background.
 l personally have no problem
 with the theory of doing
 a concept video at all.
 To me, it's more of a question
 of what you have more control over,
 and we're going to give
 some control up this time
 and, you know, see how it works.
 That song was part of the second wave
 of songs that we wrote with Ed.
 l still didn't really understand
 songwriting at that point,
 and pretty much
 that whole song is in A.
 There's not really, like, a real
 major chord change in that song.
 lt sort of goes
 against the rules of, like,
 how to write a pop song.
 Ed had been reading a newspaper
 when we were starting to
 jam on the song
 and basically wrote the entire lyrics
 off of a newspaper article.
 Visually making that video
 with Mark Pellington,
 he did such a great job
 at making you see
 kind of how heavy that lyric was.
 You seem
 kind of embarrassed about it.
 This seems to me to be quite a valid
 sort of artistic thing
 to be doing up there.
 lt was just... lt's a different...
 You know,
 it's a different kind of focus.
 You know, and that's the key to it,
 is just focusing, you know,
 but kind of like, with a camera,
 that's just... You know,
 l'm just not into it really.
 Yeah!
 We've never played
 for this many people before.
 We never thought we'd ever play
 for this many people.
 So you ready for one more?
 1, 2, 3, 4.
 Yeah, lots of times,
 especially when our singer
 starts climbing up on the ceiling,
 like, 50 feet above the stage,
 and, like, is on a truss.
 You know, it's like, ''Don't do that.''
 Were you worried he'd fall down?
 All the time.
 l thought, ''This guy's gonna
 fall and kill himself,
 ''and our career is over.''
 l was worried every time he did it.
 Over the gigs,
 it got higher and higher.
 You'd do one,
 and then you'd notch it up,
 because you survived
 the last one, so...
 We're gonna take this to some level
 that people aren't gonna forget,
 and if that means risking your life,
 we're gonna do it.
 You know, we'd get to the hotel
 after the shows or whatever
 and feel pretty good physically,
 and then l'd take a shower
 and realize that l had, like,
 a thousand deep scratches on my back.
 l didn't want him to hurt himself.
 But at the same time, it's like
 there was no talking to him.
 He was going to do
 what he was going to do.
 He could have killed himself
 a couple of times probably
 for sure, which would have been...
 More than l could have taken.
 Tell me. You look quite mixed up.
 Look at these pictures.
 l'll show you these pictures.
 l'll show you why
 l feel the way l do.
 lt's a little bit overwhelming
 to see this many people.
 l mean, l'm sure you've been
 looking at this all day.
 lt's a lot of people.
 We're used to playing small clubs,
 you know,
 and we want to go back
 to playing small clubs.
 He wanted Pearl Jam to be a band
 that goes out and tours in the van
 and pays its dues and plays clubs
 and makes albums and
 has a slow, natural life.
 He was not the guy
 that wanted to come out
 and have overnight success.
 l think he was critical
 about the mixes of Ten.
 He felt like maybe they were
 leaning too commercial.
 He was really reluctant.
 You are also not going to be
 doing videos right away at least.
 We just don't know.
 You know,
 our mind is on music right now,
 which is probably a really
 good thing for everybody.
 l think l got that theory
 to make that part work.
 l come in one earlier
 than l normally do.
 So l still do four.
 So it almost felt like it didn't...
 lt almost kind of always felt like
 l did
 one too many or something,
 but it didn't, like, play itself.
 Let's just do it one more time.
 A lot of my job
 is taking what they bring
 and turning it into something.
 Okay, this is a chord change.
 This is this. This is a melody.
 Okay, but what does that mean?
 Where am l?
 lf l close my eyes, where am l?
 What does this music mean?
 Let's just figure out
 where we want to go on that verse.
 l was at this, like,
 small, little coffee shop,
 and someone came up and stopped me,
 and the waitress, this older lady,
 kind of witnessed it
 and said, ''You're...''
 l said, ''Yeah, yeah,'' you know.
 She says, ''What? You don't like it?''
 l said, ''lt's just...
 ''lt's no big deal, you know.
 l'm just this guy.''
 And she says,
 ''lf you don't like it, you know,
 ''you certainly picked
 the wrong business to be in.''
 And she had a really good point.
 The fact is, when you sit
 in your room playing guitar,
 you don't have to worry
 about being successful.
 lt's not gonna happen.
 lt's just not gonna happen.
 The point of doing an encore
 just doesn't make any sense to me.
 When you're playing
 in front of 30 people...
 l had done the movie
 ''Say Anything...''
 and was anxious to do
 the next movie here in Seattle,
 and it was going to have
 that mix of music that l love.
 The studio looked at the movie
 and said,
 ''We don't know
 how to sell this movie.
 ''We don't even want to put it out.''
 But as Nirvana got bigger
 and Pearl Jam got bigger,
 they came to me and said,
 ''Well, you know, there is one way.''
 When we looked at the schedule,
 it was like there was one day off
 that week,
 and that was the day
 that he wanted us to play,
 and we're just going like, ''Shit.''
 Any memories of
 the ''Singles'' party in Los Angeles,
 which we have
 very vivid footage from.
 God. Do you have
 some footage of that?
 We do.
 The unaired, of course, footage.
 Yeah. l won't watch that.
 Fuck MTV! Fuck all TV!
 lt was pretty bad.
 We're all just warming up, you know.
 lt's not like one of these
 fucking movie things.
 You've got to warm up, right?
 lt was a disaster,
 a total disaster.
 Everybody loves us.
 Everybody loves our town!
 There were some long soundchecks
 that day or something.
 So l drank, like, one bottle of wine,
 and then there was, like,
 another that l opened
 to give to friends,
 and they weren't drinking.
 And so we're downstairs,
 and there's a bottle of tequila
 sitting down there,
 which we hardly ever drank
 before the show,
 but by that point, we were already,
 like, fucking wasted.
 l actually have more memories
 than you'd think l would have.
 The monitors
 weren't working that well,
 or my ears weren't working,
 one or the other.
 l kept looking over and
 asking them to turn the monitors up.
 l can't hear anything.
 And it just wouldn't turn up.
 At some point after a while,
 l just got really upset,
 and l went over.
 They had this pipe and drape thing,
 and l pulled it off
 and threw it down or something.
 l don't know. ls this documented?
 l looked over,
 and that wasn't our soundwoman.
 lt was the lighting person.
 l kept wondering, like,
 ''Why is it getting brighter in here?''
 l began to see studio executives
 and their families
 starting to stream for the exits.
 Some fights were breaking out.
 Don't be violent!
 Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
 Because we had waited so long
 for anyone to ask us to do something
 that we were saying yes, yes, yes.
 That was a moment where
 it was really evident
 that there was always gonna be
 one more thing they were
 gonna want you to do.
 At some point, you had to say no.
 That was the birth of no.
 Let's keep things rolling here, Tab.
 ''Grunge rockers Pearl Jam.''
 We don't have time
 to explain the puzzle to you,
 but we'll be back.
 Shit got fucking crazy.
 -Who are Pearl Jam?
 -Right.
 This is MTV's ''Smells Like Grunge''
 countdown.
 l was just screaming for anything.
 l wanted something of Eddie's.
 And they gave me the wine bottle.
 What did you think of the show?
 lt was fucking so awesome.
 Could you do a Week in Rock
 open for us?
 What is that?
 We're just about to launch
 MTV in Latin America.
 l don't know if you feel comfortable
 doing a couple of l.D.'s for us...
 -Sure.
 -Sure.
 ln Spanish. So if you
 could just hang on. Josh.
  Pearl Jam.
   MTV.
 What do you think grunge means?
 l don't even say that word.
 Really?
 All your friends are
 talking about is Pearl Jam.
 Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam.
 Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam.
 l've always hated their band.
 The first Pearl Jam
 record came out two months
 before the Nevermind record,
 so it turned into
 a Pearl Jam versus Nirvana thing.
 Nirvana's Kurt Cobain made
 some rather disparaging remarks
 about Pearl Jam's music,
 which he thought was too commercial
 to be truly alternative.
 l was so naive and fresh
 when we first came out,
 singing and opening up,
 and then everyone
 just looked at it
 from a cynical point of view
 or started copying it.
 Eddie Vedder joins
 Creed front man Scott Stapp.
 Eddie Vedder is attempting
 to rip out Scott Stapp's larynx
 with his bare hands.
 The group is called Pearl Jam.
 l'm talking about Pearl Jam.
 Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam.
 Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam.
 Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam.
 Pearl Jam...
 Hi. l'm Tabitha Soren
 with ''MTV News.''
 Pearl Jam will become the second
 Seattle band within a month
 to enter
 the Billboard pop albums chart
 at number one next week.
 Since its release a week ago,
 Vs. has sold 950,000 copies.
 A million.
 You know, what's a million?
 l'm having a hard enough time
 with one right now.
 We played ''Saturday Night Live''
 the second time,
 and l remember
 talking to Stone the next day,
 and he said, ''What did you
 think of Daughter?''
 And l thought in my mind,
 we played Daughter?
 So l essentially blacked out on TV.
 And that's how l dealt with
 how big we got,
 kind of checking out
 and partying a lot.
 l bought into the myth,
 and it was killing me.
 The last time l talked to Kurt,
 we both agreed together
 that we were not
 going to participate in
 the Time Magazine.
 Neither band was going to participate
 in the Time Magazine interview,
 and we didn't,
 and then they put me
 on the fucking cover anyway.
 l mean, sure, l could read it,
 you know, and l read it.
 l read it on the airplanes.
 But l don't take it seriously.
 lf l want to find out anything,
 l'm not gonna read Time Magazine.
 Time Magazine was just, you know,
 your parents' magazine
 or the magazine
 that's in a doctor's office,
 and l just thought,
 ''We've been swallowed up
 by the mainstream,
 ''and no one's gonna want to
 listen to us.''
 l'm not gonna read Newsweek.
 l'm not gonna read
 any of these magazines.
 l mean, 'cause they've just got
 too much to lose
 by printing the truth.
 You know that.
 How were you going to survive
 and not do something wrong,
 not piss someone off?
 You know, now you've sold
 too many records,
 but these people are so happy
 to hear your music,
 but these people hate you now.
 And... And these people
 love you so much
 they want to kill you.
 So how do you relate to
 any of these people
 from where you are?
 Yeah, l think the one that
 l wanted to get impersonal with
 was No Code
 because of stalker problems
 and built a wall
 in front of the house
 because... Because why?
 Because l had been open
 and honest and intimate in lyrics,
 that seemed really strange.
 Now l'm having to build a wall
 in front of the house.
 l mean, that wall...
 lt saved my life.
 Not because of privacy
 or anything, but literally,
 because someone drove,
 trying to drive into the house
 at 50 miles an hour.
 So, you wonder what happened
 or how did it mutate into
 this kind of situation?
 You'll have to edit this part.
 The young musician
 who made grunge music popular
 had become an overnight spokesman
 for many disaffected young Americans,
 as his fans tried to sort out
 what it was
 that caused him to take his life.
 l was trying to, like, with my eyes
 trying to tell them, ''Don't hurt me.''
 And what's all this nonsense
 about how terrible life is?
 A young girl who stood outside
 his home in Seattle
 with tears
 streaming down her face said,
 ''lt's hard to be
 a young person nowadays.
 ''He helped open people's eyes
 to our struggles.''
 Please wipe the tears
 from your eyes, dear.
 You're breaking my heart.
 l'd love to relieve
 the pain you're going through
 by switching my age for yours.
 l was trying to call him
 because l'd read something he said,
 that he couldn't keep it real,
 and l just wanted
 to tell him, ''Listen,
 ''you don't have to do anything
 ''anybody fucking tells you to do.
 ''Just stop fucking playing,
 cancel all your shit,
 ''and don't do anything.''
 l had a whole thing
 l was going to tell him,
 but l never got a chance.
 Sometimes people elevate you,
 you know,
 whether you like it or not.
 lt's real easy to fall.
 l don't think any of us would be
 in this room here tonight
 if it weren't for Kurt Cobain, so...
 People think that we're whining
 or crying about success
 if we're just really trying
 to tell you
 that there's some intense pressures
 and really some things
 that could be helped.
 He resonates in my life
 in this... lt always comes up,
 like, around a campfire
 or playing music with a few guys
 he had known in a garage
 for no particular reason.
 l always just think,
 ''He would have...
 ''He would have liked this.''
 l really like him.
 l think he's a nice,
 really nice person.
 l didn't like him a lot then,
 when l was talking shit
 about him all the time,
 but now l can...
 l can appreciate him, you know.
 l mean, l've realized that, you know,
 the same people that like
 our band like their band,
 so why create some kind
 of feud over something?
 He made us think about
 everything that we did, you know.
 His critique of us early on
 sure kept us on good behavior.
 ln terms of everything that we did,
 we thought,
 ''Okay, why are we doing this?''
 lf we're good now,
 it's partly because of him.
 lt's not like you're friends
 or anything.
 l mean, l can consider him
 a person that l really like.
 l mean, we've had a few
 conversations on the phone,
 and l really like him.
 l think he's a nice,
 really nice person.
 Yeah, l remember
 the sound of his voice,
 but l don't remember
 what we talked about.
 Just normal stuff.
 lt was just real...
 Just real normal.
 l haven't let myself change,
 but the way people see you changes,
 and that's not in my hands,
 that's not in my control.
 And maybe what is in my control
 is not doing interviews,
 or not being on the TV,
 and not anything to kind of
 glorify your face or position.
 l was talking about this band
 being a bit more faceless,
 and it can be done, you know.
 Pink Floyd and...
 l mean, it can be done.
 Ed couldn't be anonymous,
 and it was affecting him.
 So l think psychologically,
 he needed to take control
 of something.
 So then he was like, ''Okay.
 l can have control over music.''
 l felt that anything that we put out
 was highly representative of me,
 because l was kind of becoming
 the most recognizable guy.
 Vitalogy was the first record
 where it was like we were making
 a record in a different way.
 l was writing a few songs,
 but all of a sudden
 everybody was starting to write,
 and he was writing more,
 and l was like,
 ''Wait a minute, you know.
 l'm the guy.
 ''You know, let me get in there
 and do this thing.
 ''l know how to do this thing.''
 And at the time l thought,
 ''This isn't our best record.''
 The dynamics of the band
 of how they have changed
 to who was ''in power,''
 Stone early on,
 Ed now.
 As much as l'm excited to play,
 l'll cop to it, it's a surfing tour.
 l plan on having a surfboard
 with me at all times.
 That was a big worldwide tour.
 l think it was the first time
 we went to Australia.
 lt was a challenging time,
 to kind of go,
 ''l don't know if we're
 the same band right now,
 ''but we might be a different band
 right now,
 ''and maybe
 they'll like the new band.''
 Jeff and l have always had
 this adversarial relationship.
 lt's all been muted now
 because what we thought of
 as our new band
 that we might try to control together
 immediately was taken over by Ed.
 But we learned
 the greatest lesson of all,
 which is just as you're fighting
 over the scraps of control,
 you meet somebody
 with so much artistic energy
 that your argument becomes pointless.
 We were always kind of
 going towards something else.
 l think we wanted to be
 more like Zeppelin.
 l think we wanted to be more
 of a chameleon type of band.
 We didn't want to be locked into,
 like, a real specific style.
 But the business aspect
 of the record company,
 it's all about
 fucking making money now
 and fucking wind this thing up,
 and you know,
 they could care less
 if it's gone tomorrow
 because they've got something
 coming up the fucking backside
 that's gonna replace it.
 And we were just trying to figure out
 how we were gonna be a band
 down the road, you know.
 Like, there wasn't anybody to
 go to at that point, you know,
 not until we met Neil.
 The first time we got asked
 to play The Bridge School
 in San Francisco,
 we just made a connection there.
 He said,
 ''Hey, man, thanks for doing this.''
 And a few months later,
 he asked us to go to Europe with him.
 Like, it all seems like...
 All seems like a dream to me.
 Doing a record with him,
 we did Mirror Ball,
 it was so educational, listening
 to him talk about his career.
 Playing in stadiums one minute,
 and then the next time
 he's playing in clubs,
 and then he's playing
 in medium-sized places,
 but all along, he's doing
 whatever he wants to do.
 His point is to kind of
 roll with the punches.
 l'm happy to finally have
 an adult in my life
 that leads by example.
 l've had some crazy adults
 in my life.
 So it's about time l got one
 that inspires me.
 l hope Neil's feeling feisty tonight,
 and speaking of feisty,
 some smart-ass
 who arranged the tables
 put our table right next to
 Ticketmaster's table over here.
 So l predict a food fight
 by the end of the evening,
 and l would recommend
 to the classy people over there
 to scoot away or join in.
 Maybe we should all join in
 while we got them right here.
 ln the United States,
 the hit rock band Pearl Jam
 has taken battle against
 what it claims
 is the greed of
 the entertainment industry.
 lt's tackling the high cost of buying
 from the country's biggest
 ticket agency, Ticketmaster.
 All the band wants, it says,
 is a fair deal for the fans.
 We don't want
 to be doing a press conference.
 We want to be playing.
 The nation's top rock band
 is accusing
 the biggest ticket distributor
 in the business
 of unfair practices
 and price-gouging.
 lf they don't agree to Ticketmaster's
 terms, they can't perform.
 A spokesman insisted
 Ticketmaster never told
 any promoter not to book Pearl Jam.
 He dismissed the band members as,
 Last month, the band took
 the extraordinary step
 of filing a complaint here
 at the justice department.
 When you're on that big of a stage,
 it's not in your control.
 You're sort of playing a part
 to some larger drama.
 We had a very specific problem
 with Ticketmaster,
 and they asked us to come and testify
 about our specific problem
 in regards to a larger lawsuit
 that was being brought,
 but it's always been
 perceived as, like,
 we were trying to
 break up Ticketmaster.
 The subcommittee will come to order.
 We are honored
 to have representatives
 of both Pearl Jam and
 Ticketmaster here with us today.
 The key question is whether
 recent contractual agreements
 between Ticketmaster
 and most major stadiums
 and concert promoters have violated
 federal antitrust laws.
 Who would like to go first? Stone?
 All the members of Pearl Jam
 remember what it's like
 to be young
 and not have a lot of money.
 Many Pearl Jam fans are teenagers
 who do not have the money
 to pay $30 or more
 that is often charged
 for tickets today.
 We have made a conscious decision
 that we do not want to put
 the price of our concerts
 out of the reach of our fans.
 Mr. Chairman,
 this is really about choices.
 Fans can go from one music store
 to another
 to find the best deal on a CD,
 but they can't go anywhere
 but Ticketmaster
 for concert tickets.
 Do you think Ticketmaster
 is entitled to a profit?
 l don't think
 that question matters, you know.
 You do have a contract
 with your record company,
 and it is exclusive. ls that correct?
 l think this line
 of questioning is very strange,
 because it seems like what does that
 really have to do with anything?
 The issue at hand here
 is whether Ticketmaster
 is a monopoly, not whether...
 Or to have anything to do with
 our business
 or what our relationship is
 with our manager.
 Let's just get it on the record.
 -Mr. Horn.
 -Now l gather...
 Do you want these guys
 to play Long Beach or not?
 What l want is a record.
 What l want is a record here.
 Let's just get it on the record.
 A record here.
 First of all, l want you to know
 l think you're just darling guys.
 This is so great.
 When we got involved in this issue,
 l did not know very much, and still
 don't, about alternative music.
 After some requests, l tried to learn
 some Pearl Jam songs,
 but l think it's a little beyond me.
 Having been a fan
 for many, many years,
 l don't want to become
 something that l despised
 as a kid, you know.
 When my staff told me
 we were going to have this hearing,
 l have to tell you,
 l knew nothing about grunge,
 but l know a lot about the importance
 of fairness and equity,
 and l think you've raised
 some very important questions.
 Who were the powers-that-be
 that wanted to be perceived
 as putting some pressure
 on Ticketmaster?
 lt's like, you know,
 those are back-room,
 David Lynch-ian guys in hotel rooms
 who need oxygen tanks, darkened L.A.
 That's who l always think of.
 lt's like, he understands.
 Almost a year after picking its fight
 with Ticketmaster,
 Pearl Jam remains alone
 among major rock bands
 who could have joined
 the Seattle group in its boycott
 but never did.
 lt's just a few lonely voices
 because not many
 of the other groups joined up.
 There's no deal
 between us and Ticketmaster.
 We're not playing
 Ticketmaster shows this summer.
 Shows where we're going
 outside of cities
 and building shows
 from the ground up,
 that was a really tough time.
 We're trying to find how many
 counterfeit tickets are out there.
 We saw some people selling tickets.
 So we bought them.
 We were all psyched.
 And then we got up to the door,
 and they said they were counterfeit.
 Right now,
 we're trying to figure out
 how to help these kids
 get into the show.
 Let me just leave you
 with this observation.
 When art is successful,
 it unavoidably becomes a business.
 The question then is
 whether artists have
 an inherent right
 to control the limits
 of their business
 and how it relates to
 the growth of their art.
 The answer, l'm convinced,
 is that artists do have
 a right to that control.
 l think we've always
 just fallen into ways
 of doing things the way
 we felt they should be done,
 and whether they were right
 or whether they were wrong,
 they were just our ways of doing it.
 l've never heard of Pearl Jam,
 l must admit.
 That makes two of us.
 And here we are in your fine place.
 And what are the things
 that you've kept
 that remind you of the experience
 the last 20 years with the band?
 l'm sure l've kept the least amount
 of things of anyone in the band.
 How l've always justified that is,
 one, l lose everything all the time.
 So it comes naturally to me.
 And two, Jeff Ament keeps so much,
 and really, if all l have to do
 is just maintain
 my good relationship with Jeff Ament,
 l can always go over to his house
 and look through
 all the stuff that he has,
 and celebrate
 his keeping of the things.
 Pearl Jam in Mexico City
 memorial... These are some
 of the Mexico City coffee cups.
 So that's a...
 lt's a little faded now.
 Because you use it.
 This one clearly needs to go
 back in the dishwasher.
 Here's something.
 Mike McCready just sent me this.
 lt's the demos from
 Temple of the Dog.
 l've got a few...
 This is a box full of Pearl Jam
 ''Touring Band'' DVDs.
 And that's 2000.
 l don't know why they're still there.
 l haven't... l'm not sure...
 And a few Pearl Jam CDs here,
 the kind of stuff probably
 l had someone bring by
 because l was trying to remember
 how to play some songs.
 l don't know if there's anything else
 in here.
 Let's see here.
 Yep, that might be it.
 There might be something
 in the basement.
 Lookit. There's a Grammy.
 l knew this was gonna come in handy.
 You can tell how l feel
 about the Grammys.
 You know, at the Grammys,
 l was having kind of a bad day.
 l was getting thrown out
 by security people
 for trying to sneak a cigarette
 in the backstage,
 and you couldn't go out because
 of all the photographers there.
 So that was part of it.
 Spin the Black Circle, Pearl Jam.
 l hate to start off with a bang.
 l'm gonna say something typically me
 on behalf of all of us.
 l don't know what this means.
 l don't think it means anything.
 That's just how l feel.
 l remember arguing with
 tons of my friends,
 because my friends were like,
 ''Man, what the fuck
 was your boy doing?
 ''Like, if he doesn't want
 to be there,
 ''then he shouldn't be there,''
 and kind of all this stuff.
 And l was kind of like,
 ''Fuck you, man.''
 Like, what does it mean, you know?
 Like, are you fucking kidding me?
 You get an award for art?
 Like, that's just ridiculous.
 Like, if l would have had the balls,
 l would have said the same thing.
 l should have started a fight
 right there.
 lt would have been
 much more exciting.
 What would all these young people
 be doing
 if they had real problems
 like a depression or Vietnam?
 Do they work at all?
 Are they contributing anything
 to the world
 they're taking so much from?
 lt was kind of around
 the Ticketmaster tour.
 The four of us, Jack, Stone,
 Jeff, and l were traveling in a jet.
 Eddie was traveling in a van,
 doing a radio show,
 and then driving all night
 to the next show.
 So there was
 a huge physical disconnect,
 but also an emotional one.
 And nobody was
 kind of really talking.
 He was trying to maintain something
 that was more a Fugazi or
 do-it-yourself type mentality.
 You know, and we loved them,
 but we weren't that band.
 We needed to sit down
 with him and go, ''Look,
 ''are you embarrassed by us?
 ''Do you want to be
 in the band anymore?''
 We thought we were
 going to break up essentially.
 l thought... l thought
 that was going to happen.
 And we all agreed we needed to
 take some time off and figure it out.
 That's highway 200,
 and we're like right...
 We just passed Ovando.
 We're headed towards Lincoln.
 And then we just keep going
 to the northeast.
 That's the spot right there,
 Big Sandy.
 That's your hometown?
 This is the middle of nowhere, man.
 l was sort of pissed off
 at my parents
 for making me live in
 this desolate...
 l mean, l was hundreds of miles away
 from anybody
 that l could even relate to.
 l was ready to leave at about 14.
 A couple trips to California,
 like, really fucked me up.
 My mom's brother, my uncle Pat,
 he had long hair,
 and he had tapestries up in his room,
 and he'd put the headphones on me,
 and he'd play, like,
 Abraxas by Santana,
 and it would just blow my mind.
 l remember just getting, like,
 a huge buzz off of it, like,
 and getting, like, kind of emotional.
 And l would go out
 and try to look for records.
 lt was really hard to find. There was
 no record store in our town.
 So l started subscribing to
 Circus and Cream magazine,
 and my uncle got
 Rolling Stone magazine.
 And l mean, you'd study that stuff.
 ln a lot of those punk-rock records,
 you could really hear bass, you know.
 You could fucking hear Dee Dee
 on those Ramones records.
 You know, he was on the right side,
 and Johnny was on the left side.
 So if you were trying
 to learn the songs,
 you could just turn the dial over
 to the right side
 and learn all of Dee Dee's parts.
 l moved to Seattle in 1983,
 and l think all l wanted to do
 up to that point
 was to live in a bigger city
 where there was
 more like-minded people
 and more culture
 and a punk-rock show,
 if l wanted to go see a cool movie.
 There were all these...
 You know, ''Eraserhead.''
 l was hearing about all these movies
 that l never got a chance to see.
 l don't know if it was
 the first contact, it must have been,
 was from Jeff,
 and l do remember there being a...
 A real connection made on the phone,
 and talking about artwork,
 how he was into artwork,
 and your responsibilities
 as a band member
 or working with people that get
 that it's not a slacker job,
 or it's not a rock star thing,
 or it's not...
 lt's about music. lt's about art.
 lt's about...
 We had all these things in common,
 which is probably why
 we ended up roommates
 when we first started touring.
 l think that we just connected
 and became really close.
 lt's amazing now to look back.
 l remember when
 Ed first came to town.
 lt seemed like it was something
 that he had been kind of
 waiting for his whole life,
 and it was obvious
 within the first few minutes
 that it was something that
 l'd been waiting for also.
 l think it would be a very easy band
 in some ways for us not to be a band,
 and nobody can really kind of
 put a finger on what it is
 that, you know, kind of keeps us
 coming back together,
 but it's a strange marriage.
 l met Mike McCready
 when l was in seventh grade.
 He was good.
 You know, he played solos
 and had a whammy bar and, like,
 could do the...
 And all this stuff.
 l had lived in Los Angeles,
 trying to make it in my band
 Shadow in 1986 for a year,
 and l paid to play,
 paid to play at The Roxy,
 $700 on a Sunday night in December.
 And there was five people there.
 So l struggled and went through that,
 and l gave up
 playing music for a little while,
 moved back to Seattle and said,
 ''l can't. l'm done.''
 And then, lo and behold, l get
 a call out of the blue from Stone.
 l got to see him play at a party
 one night
 when he was just sitting around
 and playing lead guitar with somebody
 and was just, in the way
 that he does, unconsciously,
 giving you these jolts.
 He's channeling stuff
 that sounds like
 it's coming from the fucking heavens,
 but l think it's coming from inside.
 There's something spiritual
 about the way he plays.
 And that's when he's in tune
 with the good stuff, you know.
 As you know, the song Reach Down,
 which was the second song l wrote
 for the Temple of the Dog record,
 l wanted it to be sort of like
 a Neil Young,
 ''Fuck you to the world of people
 ''who don't want to hear
 a guitar solo.
 ''l'm gonna make an 1 1 or 1 2-minute
 song that's mostly guitar solo,
 ''and that's gonna be
 the first song on the album,
 ''and you can fuck off.''
 When l heard Cready play guitar,
 l was like,
 ''We're gonna pull it off for real.
 ''This isn't gonna be a joke.
 He can actually fucking play.''
 Because l couldn't.
 He went out of his mind.
 this guy's a...
 he's a fucking rock star.
 Like, he's got problems,
 and we just thought
 he was a nice little kid.
 And he's got something in there,
 like, he's infected,
 and that's gonna come out
 again somewhere. Good luck, guys.
 He knows me. That's...
 l would say that's 100 accurate.
 Eddie said,
 ''Ask Mike about the drummers.''
 Ask me about the drummers?
 Yeah. He says, ''Mike will
 give you the drummers rap.''
 Here we go.
 We started out with Dave Krusen.
 lt didn't work out.
 Matt Chamberlain,
 he didn't want to go on the road.
 He knew of a drummer
 named Dave Abbruzzese.
 lt's very Spinal Tap of us
 to have this many drummers.
 Jack lrons.
 -Good drummer.
 -Great look. Good drummer.
 Jack was the guy that gave the tape
 that he got from Stone to Ed.
 Ed wanted to repay that favor
 and say, ''Hey,
 you want to come and try out?''
 And we toured with him
 after we did Yield,
 and he played on that whole record.
 That's when it was starting to
 get too much for Jack.
 He called up
 and said that he couldn't tour.
 We already had a tour booked.
 Who can we call that can do that?
 Matt Cameron.
 Soundgarden had broken up,
 so Ed called him.
 Eddie, what's going on?
 And he's like, ''Hey,
 what are you doing this summer?''
 Nothing.
 We need to leave in three weeks.
 -ln 10 days, he learned 80 songs.
 -They had a list of, like, 60 or 70.
 Something crazy like that.
 l would just sort of, like,
 close my eyes,
 and l'd go like that,
 and it was like,
 ''Okay, do l know that song?''
 lt's like, ''No!''
 Matt Cameron made us
 a better band than we've ever been.
 When we'd... We'd have to switch,
 let's say, a drummer or something,
 you do it out of survival mode.
 lt's just like removing an organ.
 And when you remove,
 like, the drummer,
 you're removing, like, the heart.
 So it's like
 you had a heart transplant.
 Binaural is a dark time for me
 for sure,
 because l had my Crohn's.
 l have Crohn's disease.
 l was struggling with that,
 struggling with addiction.
 l was taking pills
 to take care of that,
 and then that got out of hand.
 For me, it was a struggle, for sure.
 ln the early years,
 we had those transcendent shows
 where it was just like
 everybody was drunk,
 and it was just
 the ''lose your mind'' shows.
 Everybody lose your mind
 at once, you know.
 lt was harder to lose your mind
 at that point
 because everyone was more like,
 ''l'm 32.
 ''You know,
 we've got some records out.
 ''l've got this relationship,
 or you know...''
 We just became more self-conscious
 and more aware as you do
 as you're an adult,
 but it's more difficult
 to kind of go, ''Okay.
 ''We got to just go out
 and get crazy.''
 And around this time,
 l think we were...
 You know, we were less popular.
 l don't think
 we were doing any press.
 We'd have meetings
 about those things.
 lt's like, ''How far are we
 gonna do press on this tour?
 ''Are we gonna do this?
 Are we gonna do that?
 ''Or are we not going to
 do any of it?''
 And when you don't do any of it
 and the changing times,
 you know, you fluctuate,
 people get over you, you know.
 That's probably around that time
 Binaural is.
 Maybe people were like, ''Okay.
 We're kind of over these guys.
 ''What's next?'' you know.
 But some people stayed with us
 because we stayed true
 to whatever our vision was.
 How important
 is commercial success to you?
 Does grunge still exist today?
 How did the second 10 years happen?
 You did survive.
 And what are the turning points
 to you?
 Change your position. Moving back.
 We still have a problem here.
 lt's one of Europe's
 worst concert tragedies.
 The band had stopped playing
 just before the incident.
 Deadly trouble in the shape of
 a crowd 40,000 to 50,000 strong.
 There has been a lot
 of pushing and pressure up here,
 and 10 to 15 people
 have been badly hurt.
 We don't know how bad yet.
 Tragedy occurred in the rain and mud
 late Friday night at the annual
 ''Roskilde Rock Festival''
 outside the Danish capital,
 Copenhagen,
 when rock fans surged forward
 during a performance
 by the American group Pearl Jam.
 Fans at the outdoor rock concert
 packed closer and closer
 to the stage,
 ending in a crush that killed
 nine people and injured three more.
 l just wanted to get out of there.
 l just didn't want it to be true.
 lt was happening
 right in front of us,
 but l just didn't want it to be true.
 And something as horrific
 and as shocking
 as people being pulled
 over the barricade
 that aren't alive anymore,
 what the impact of that was on us
 is, you know,
 it will never really go away.
 From that point on,
 we rethought everything.
 l didn't know what l was feeling,
 you know.
 l think l had such an onslaught
 of confusion that...
 l mean,
 the last time that l felt like that
 was when Andy Wood died, and...
 l didn't know if l wanted
 to play music anymore.
 You know, l think we kind of quantify
 everything that's happened to us
 as pre ''Roskilde''
 and after ''Roskilde,'' and...
 You know, if early on there was
 the birth or the beginning of ''No,''
 for us Roskilde was
 the beginning of ''What?''
 What are we doing?
 What do we do to assist the families?
 And what have we become?
 And what do we...
 What do we do to survive?
 l think even since Roskilde in 2000,
 l think that made everybody get
 into a real unique perspective
 on where we were at
 and how fragile life is,
 and l think ever since then,
 every once in a while,
 we'll just say to one another,
 like, ''Can you believe it?
 ''Can you believe
 we're still doing this?''
 When l interviewed the band in 1993
 for Rolling Stone magazine,
 l asked Eddie Vedder
 if there was an Andy Wood song
 he would ever
 be interested in singing.
 He said there was one
 and one day he would sing it.
 On the band's 10th anniversary
 show in Las Vegas,
 he announced to the group that
 he wanted to sing Crown of Thorns,
 one of Mother Love Bone's
 greatest songs.
 And in that moment,
 the two bands united.
 We wouldn't...
 We wouldn't mind attempting something
 that's even older than 10 years.
 For Ed to kind of
 acknowledge the past and sort of say,
 ''Yeah, this is part of
 where we came from,''
 and that he would be generous to Jeff
 and l and say, ''Yeah, of course.''
 That was another huge, huge gift.
 l used to think of Andy all the time,
 especially when the band got bigger,
 because l used to think,
 ''He would have loved
 to play this place.
 ''He would have loved
 to play this place.
 ''He'd love to play The Garden.''
 He would have tore this shit up.
 And l wrote down on this paper
 ''Andy and Ed,''
 just because l think about Andy
 all the time,
 and in the creative process,
 l always think about
 how lucky l am to still be able
 to, like, you know,
 go in my basement or, like, pick up
 a guitar and, like, write a song
 and then manifest it if l want,
 figure out how to, like,
 record it or whatever, and that...
 That's kind of all he ever hoped for,
 is just somebody
 that would just record him
 and, like, some group of guys
 that would just, you know,
 play these songs for him
 or whatever, and l...
 l wish that we could go back in time
 and be the band for him.
 He was playing in those places
 in his head...
 ...for a long time.
 So the thing is,
 is he got to play them.
 Andy.
 We played a show in Nassau.
 l would say three-quarters
 of the crowd fucking booed us.
 lt actually really bummed
 some of the band out.
 They were just, like, ''l never
 want to play that song again.''
 l actually fucking dug it.
 lt was art.
 l remember there was
 a fireman in the front row,
 and he was, like,
 showing me his badge.
 Fuck you, asshole!
 lt was just a bad time
 in American history in my mind,
 and we were trying to say
 what we thought.
 When you know the crowd has turned
 and there are that many people,
 it just feels like you might not
 make it out of there alive.
 That was Ed
 really trusting his instincts
 about a very specific thing
 that he needed to say,
 and he wanted to do it in a way
 that was antagonistic.
 l think if you have the opportunity,
 you have to... You have to
 take on that responsibility.
 You didn't like that one.
 lt's great to be in a band
 where, you know,
 we're not afraid to do that,
 not afraid to speak our minds
 and get booed once in a while.
 lt's all right.
 lt was an uncertain time
 for Pearl Jam,
 a period when many bands
 quietly break up and move on.
 But from the beginning,
 Stone and Jeff
 had always wanted a band
 that would last,
 one that would keep writing
 and recording music,
 and that's what Pearl Jam did.
 Show by show, they became
 one of the most dependably
 unpredictable bands in rock.
 Ed has a feeling pretty
 much everywhere that we play,
 and it's such a great gauge of,
 you know,
 how the crowd's feeling,
 and that's, a lot of times,
 why the set list
 doesn't get done until...
 l mean, oftentimes, it's done
 10 minutes before we play.
 As difficult as it was
 at different times,
 where you're like, ''We can
 go out and kill this crowd.
 ''We can go out
 and kill them right now.
 ''Let's just start out
 with these five songs.''
 And you know...
 ''Yeah. No. We're gonna go on,
 ''we're gonna play this one
 to start out with.''
 ''We haven't played
 this one together, but let's...
 ''We'll work it out backstage.
 lt'll be fine.''
 And inevitably, you're so nervous
 that you go out there and fumble it,
 and then you're like,
 ''God! Let me just...
 ''Let's play a hit, you know.''
 You know, it would be a lot easier
 to play a similar set every night.
 lt would just be so much easier,
 and yet we can't find it
 in ourselves to do that.
 That's why you see Pearl Jam.
 lt's fucking different every night.
 Every night it's different.
 lt's funny, but lots
 of those decisions we made,
 it took 10 years to see
 why they were good.
 ln that regard, you know,
 mixing our set list up every night,
 it's the greatest blessing
 we could have ever done.
 The door is so open for us
 to be who we are every night
 that we just trust it.
 You know, l think that all of us
 have been totally influenced
 by the seventies.
 We're all, like, products of it,
 but yet we're not, like, stuck in it.
 Our classic guitar heroes,
 you know, like Hendrix for Mike
 and, like, Jimmy Page for me,
 and, like, for Eddie, it's like
 he totally loved The Who.
 The Who was
 the greatest rock band ever.
 lt's like all these bands,
 so in a sense,
 it's a total tribute
 to the seventies.
 Roger Daltrey wrote me a letter
 saying would l like to come play,
 and l told him no way,
 because that's it.
 That's the ultimate.
 That's the pinnacle for me,
 is that band, you know,
 that arrow on the mod sign, you know.
 We have to decide whether or not
 we're going to remain a circus act.
 ln other words, doing what everybody
 knows we can do and what
 we know we can do. Right?
 Until the band eventually
 turns into a cabaret act,
 -which is inevitable.
 -No, that's ridiculous!
 Here's me and Johnny Ramone.
 l'm wearing a Bob Dole mask.
 Uncle Neil.
 This is me and Joe Strummer.
 And that's the night l met
 Jack lrons.
 This was hanging in a dressing room.
 lt was actually the first night
 l had met Pete.
 l was terrified.
 And the first thing he said was,
 ''l've waited so long to meet you.''
 Now we're just grateful
 for our band and who we are
 and what we've become,
 and grateful that we finally
 figured out how to do it.
 l think that there was a huge element
 of our fans
 that just kind of carried us
 through a period of time where
 we were not there all the way.
 You see their belief,
 and even when you don't have it,
 you go,
 ''Okay. l've got to figure this out.''
 Joining the band,
 l was super impressed
 with how in-house everything is.
 Like, there's no outside
 influence going on, you know.
 lt's like it all comes from the band.
 They saved me in a certain way.
 You know, we've been doing it
 for 10 records or 20 years,
 and l can't think of a show
 where l ever felt
 like l was just phoning it in.
 lt's always pure stoke,
 you know, like...
 l think that there really is, like,
 a collective understanding
 of how lucky and how fortunate we are
 to still be playing music
 with the same group of people.
 l mean, everybody, you can feel it,
 and it makes being in a band a joy.
 There's a... This communal exchange.
 And there's obviously a line drawn
 between who's on stage
 and who's in the crowd,
 but not really.
 l fucking loved it.
 We were two rows from the front.
 lt was fucking incredible.
 -This was my fifth show.
 -24.
 -61 .
 -54.
 153.
 Pearl Jam are a band for the fans.
 ''lf you love us, stick with us,''
 and we've stuck with them
 all the way,
 because what we get out of them
 is overwhelming.
 These guys flew
 from Bucharest this morning.
 Budapest.
 We came from Denver.
 -Townsville, Australia.
 -London, England.
 Took two weeks off from my job,
 and traveled to nine shows in a row
 last tour.
 There's not another band like them.
 Everybody rode the whole
 crest of a wave with Ten,
 and it was just the thing to be into,
 but after that, they've
 come out a lot stronger,
 because they didn't play the game.
 They took on Ticketmaster.
 They were pissed off
 that people were getting ripped off,
 and they took on the man,
 and they could have lost,
 but they didn't.
 l think this band
 is really only beginning.
 There was a rumor
 that it was sort of gonna be
 like The Kids Are Alright.
 That would be a misconception,
 because The Kids Are Alright
 is really super genius,
 and what we're gonna put out
 is gonna be really super us.
 Hey, Josh. How's it going?
 Fuck you, Kevin.
 They stay true to fans as well,
 about them releasing
 the bootlegs of their albums
 so that other people can't bootleg
 them and make a sly penny off it,
 and that's clever shit.
 We're not filming this conversation,
 are we?
 Yes, we are.
 Now you're back.
 Why do you keep doing it?
 l don't know whether they realize
 exactly how much they have given
 to us, the fans,
