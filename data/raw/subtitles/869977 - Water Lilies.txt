WATER LILIES
That was the Tiny Tots team.
The routine was presented by
the Junior team,
with Hélène,
Marie,
Nina,
Joanna,
Aïda,
Manon
and their captain...
Floriane.
I was nervous for my parents.
You OK?
I'm waiting for my costume to dry.
I forgot my panties.
Sorry.
You took your time.
I had to wait for the hairdryer.
I'm a bit scared.
Which class?
I don't know. Lousy.
Beginners.
You can sign up in September.
- Hello.
- Hello, Floriane.
Can't I join now?
Bring that back in a month
with a certificate and a cheque.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
One's heavier.
My mum did a wash.
There's a party tonight.
At one of the girl's.
Everyone's going.
The water polo guys...
The synchro girls.
18.2. You've put on 2 millimetres.
Great.
Hang on, that's good.
A load of shit.
You want my 28?
I don't know why I bother anyway,
I'm not normal.
Course you're normal.
One arm's longer.
- Are you invited?
- Where?
To the swimmer's party.
I know where it is.
I've gone easy on the lipstick.
It'll get all over him.
I don't want sex right away
but I'm behind schedule in kissing.
It's cool in countries
where they marry girls at 14.
I wouldn't be where I am now.
It's him I want to kiss.
- What?
- I saw you performing.
It was beautiful.
Really?
In what way?
I'd love to see you practise.
You got some gum?
I need someone to get me in.
Come here.
Does my breath stink?
Sure?
Hi.
Hi.
You all right?
Hang on.
- What do you want?
- To get in.
What the hell for?
I want to watch.
You get me in, I owe you a favour.
Like what?
Anything.
I don't need anything.
Got your costume?
Then it's the pike.
Or we do it at the end.
We'll do it afterwards.
Let's go from the top?
Come in. You'll see better.
How can you?
I mash them up
into a disgusting pulp.
That's stupid.
Oh no. Boys are all eyes
when a girl eats a banana.
Everybody knows that.
But what do you care?
You've gone over to the other side.
You mean where girls eat bananas?
That's what they say...
That you've done it...
with loads of boys.
Yeah, it's true.
And I love it.
About that favour...
What?
Come to my house tonight.
Where do you live?
It's Marie,
from swimming.
What are we doing?
Walking.
Where are we going?
Not far.
You managed it.
Wait here for me.
Walk me back and we're quits.
You were ages.
You can come tomorrow.
At the pool, 7 o'clock.
Come on, climb in. Let's go!
Can I sit here?
Got the money?
Is it OK?
Don't worry. He can't say no to me.
I said you're my cousin.
What did he say?
That we look alike.
You want a massage, Floriane?
- No, I'm OK.
- Go on, it'll help you relax.
- There's no time.
- Yes, there is.
You'd better go.
Your friend's playing
the slag again.
She's not my friend.
You're better off.
Come on. Get ready.
Let's go.
Inspection, girls!
Shoddy work, Natacha!
I didn't have time.
Will you say that to your husband?
"I didn't have time."
We're on in 5 minutes.
Come on.
You can sit there.
Water ballet number 5.
7.3; 7.0;
7.0; 7.4; 7.2.
The routine was presented by
the Stade Français swimmers.
No, the pattern formation
was fantastic!
And the spin was together!
Hey, girls! 3, 4...
Happy?
Coming round tomorrow?
Like the other day?
OK.
I'm in a huff with you.
I looked all over.
Where've you been?
Don't say you're not coming in.
I was with my cousin.
You like your family now?
I had no choice.
You're by yourself?
Mum's working nights.
Come in, bitch.
- You're slobbering.
- So are you.
Take more.
- Good morning.
- How are you?
I'm fine. Is Max there, please?
- I'll bring him back.
- Really?
François!
I'm walking my dog.
See you in an hour.
I won't be here.
Where will you be?
Someplace else.
I'm not coming anymore.
Sort your fucks out alone!
Hang on.
I haven't slept with him.
None of my business.
Or slept with anyone.
It's not what people say.
I promise, Marie.
That swimming teacher
who gave me a massage...
He never lets up and corners me
in the changing-rooms.
He says he loves me. What a joke.
But always seeing me half-naked
drives him mad.
We kissed once,
which hasn't helped.
I only did it
to wind up the bitches.
So they're all bitches?
They don't like me,
so I don't like them.
Girls don't like me.
You know the pool guy...
One day I was training alone,
holding my breath underwater,
and I saw two hairy legs appear.
And...
He'd got his cock out,
showing it to me.
I suppose a hard-on in cold water
is flattering.
Gross.
That's life.
You must have stories like that.
Go on, tell.
Really?
Nothing?
You're lucky, Marie.
Very lucky.
See you, then.
See you.
I'm not tired.
Me neither.
Come on in.
That's for you.
Try it on.
Here?
Don't play shy.
The ceiling is probably
the last thing most people see.
For at least 90% of people
that die.
For sure.
And when you die,
the last thing you see
is printed in your eye.
Like a photo.
Imagine the number of people
with ceilings in their eyes.
Ceilings will never seem the same.
I was with François.
It's always the same.
Things get hot, I run away.
The poor guy's lost.
Just tell him.
I can't.
You don't want to do it, don't.
I have to.
Where d'you read that?
All over my face, apparently.
He finds out I'm not a real slag,
it's over.
Go horse-riding, then.
That's to have abortions.
I'll find an older guy I don't know.
Where will you find one?
I don't know.
In a club.
That's horrible.
It's over in 10 minutes.
Come with me.
To watch you have it off?
Your hair down suits you.
I'm off.
My friend needs to hurry up.
- Her daddy's waiting.
- What?
Yeah, her daddy.
He was worried about perverts
picking us up.
Bye-bye, daddy.
Thanks.
The jerk was a bad kisser.
Wait.
I want to ask you something...
...not quite normal.
Who cares about being normal.
It should be you.
I would like...
...you to be the first.
You get rid of it...
...remove it for me.
Then it'll be real.
I can't do that.
Please, Marie.
That one's nice.
And this one?
Not bad.
Cover me.
You're on your own.
Hello.
Can I help you?
I've other ones.
Bye.
Look, it's like in Peau d'Ane.
It's a horse that shits diamonds.
Pretty close.
I nearly swallowed it ten times.
You're walking funny.
My new jeans are a bit tight.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'll have a Happy Meal.
- How old are you?
- 15.
You're too old.
That's stupid! It's all I want.
- It's for kids.
- Forget it.
But it's crazy!
You need ID now
to get a cheaper burger?
- Let's go.
- No, I want the toy.
It's cool mini-binoculars.
Excellent.
I can see your pores.
Great.
You coming swimming after?
No.
You say that, then I see you there.
We don't need to do
everything together.
Nor separately either.
I'm sick of your childish crap.
Says she, Mrs No Boobs.
You've had boobs since
primary school. They're phoney.
They're all fat.
That's nasty.
I'm fed up with you.
You're a burden.
OK, guys!
Out!
Look what he gave me.
Fasten it.
I don't believe in that anymore.
Do you?
No.
I'm in deep shit.
He wants to see me tonight.
My parents are out.
I'll do it.
What you asked.
Wait.
I've got to go.
Thanks for everything, Marie.
Hi.
Hi.
Thanks for the necklace.
You're welcome.
You're alone?
Can I come in?
We mustn't split up, Marie.
I do daft things by myself.
You coming to the pool party?
No.
Go on.
Stay with me.
No.
I must go.
François is going.
Stop daydreaming.
He's with her.
They did it last night.
Not true.
Yes, it's true.
Get it into your head.
Forget your stupid princess dreams.
It's not true.
Yeah, right.
He told me.
Like he talks to you.
We slept together.
He came over and slept with me.
He sleeps with me,
she doesn't want to.
Maybe he likes me a bit.
It doesn't matter.
There's still my first kiss.
Me too, you know...
I love someone too.
Who is it?
Do I know him?
No.
You'll be OK?
Hold on.
I quite like you.
Right, let's split.
I can't leave yet.
Come on.
I'm staying.
By yourself?
I'm not by myself.
Someone's waiting for me.
You sure she is?
Come home with me.
No one likes her.
Bye.
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.
- Come with me.
- It's good here.
What's up?
I want to ask you something.
Come here.
Come, Marie.
So you see...
It wasn't so difficult.
I'm going back in.
Not bad, is he?
If he's a jerk, come and rescue me.
