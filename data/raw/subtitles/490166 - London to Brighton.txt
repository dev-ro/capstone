You want some food?
We'll get you some food, all right?
Go in there. Stay there,
don't open the toilet to anyone.
Please, you do come back.
- Yeah,
I promise, I will.
I'll bring you some food, all right?
Got a fucking problem?
Look the fucking other away then.
Can you put the toy in, please?
We have to get a train and go somewhere.
We ain't safe here.
I got my relative in Brighton.
We can go there for a bit
What happened to Mandy?
Shut up, don't worry, ain't gonna find us
Look, you're gonna have to stay here.
You're gonna have to stay here in the cubicle.
I gotta go get some money,
so we can get the train.
What about my money?
Later, can you stay here?
For how long?
An hour, hour and a half
I don't wanna be on my own
I know, but you can't come with me
Look, just wait here, I
won't be long, all right?
All right mate, what are you after?
Jeez, what happened to your face?
Nothing for you to worry about
Do you want something or not?
Go on, get in
Hello! Hello! Is someone in there?
Hello! Hello!
Come on! Open up, it's me.
You all right?
Where have you been?
- Told you, I had gone make some money
Come on, we gotta get the train
Here, go sit
I think it'll take about an hour,
so why don't you go have a kip.
What about that man, Derrick?
He ain't on the train. So don't worry.
Are we gonna go to jail?
I told you, no
Now, go on, have a sleep.
I am not tired.
Yes, you are.
Here, use this as a pillow.
Stew, what's happening?
Stew, what's going on?
Get me a drink.
Is that a girl here?
Find out who she is.
I am not a fucking charity.
I've been chilling out, all right, I ain't
made money, so I need you to do this for me.
Derrick, please don't.
What? Who do you think I am asking you to do?
Mate, how long is you gonna be?
We gotta be back to work in half an hour.
Fuck off! Just wait a minute!
All right, come on.
Stop missing out, all right?
Come on.
You're the most beautiful girl I know,
what's the matter?
When I first saw you, I thought
you was a like a star or something.
You know?
And you know what's more, huh?
we've got a future,
you and me.
So we're really good.
Do you believe me?
Come on, do you believe me?
Yeah.
Right. Good, so get in there and fuck'em for me.
They've come down a long way.
They're good friends of mine.
You're beautiful, you are, you know that?
You are beautiful.
Go on, in you go.
She's coming in.
Don't take all fucking night either.
The door.
Ey, ey, ey..
Who the fuck are you?
Stewart Allen want's to see you.
Why? What for?
Just leave your cereal, and come on.
Get where ever the fuck she is,
when they are finished, throw 'em all out.
Come on.
Is this for me?
- Yeah.
You look nasty.
Do I?
Cheers.
How are you doing?
- All right.
I love the countryside.
It's nice, ain't it?
Colour.
Why the fuck did you run away?
'cause living at home was shit.
My mom's died this year,
and my dad was a bastard.
He beat me, he was always pissed.
The other week I nicked his fags,
and he kicked me in the ribs.
It's big, isn't it?
- Massive last week.
Does it hurt?
- Not as much.
What a pair, ey?
Me and you.
Black and blue.
Where are we going?
Staying with a mate for a bit.
Stay away from London.
.... fine there
He owes me money.
You ain't gonna see that, luv.
Look, I'll get it for you, all right?
I love the fields.
It's a shithole, this place.
How do people live like you?
Dunno.
Well you live like you, don't you?
What do you mean?
All this scum around here.
That's where you do live, isn't it?
Oi, punk, stop!
You can't fucking park over there mate...
So you know who I am then?
Yep.
I am talking to you, big bad fat cunt.
Open the window!
You can't just fucking sit there,
and that's the laughing boy in the fucking back.
I don't know what he is fucking about,
but it's too much mate, you
can't fucking park here.
Ouch!
- Shut up and fuck off!
Fucking toe rag girls!
That's who you deal with, isn't it?
Girls like this?
Yeah.
How often did my dad ask from you?
What do you mean?
You can take me for a stupid cunt if you want,
but one of these boys will cut your ears off.
I'll ask you again, how often
did you get my dad a girl?
A couple of times, three or four.
What kind of girls?
I don't know, he likes them young, don't he?
Did you get him a girl tonight?
And don't fucking lie to me!
Yeah, I did.
How young?
She was about...
You know what she did to him?
No, no, I don't know anything.
One of the other girls went there, honest.
Where are they now?
I dunno, I thought they'd still be there.
Well, they're not.
Who's the other girl?
Her name's Kelly.
What's happened? What have they done?
I want those two girls.
I'll find them.
You better lad, and then you're gonna call me.
All right, I will.
You got my number?
No.
Get it off him.
Find those two girls, and
if I don't hear from you...
by this time tomorrow,
you're a fucking dead man.
Get out.
Let's go.
Chum, come and pick me up.
They cut my fucking leg off.
Yeah, I am outside the jamo?
Get Kelly on the fucking phone.
Find out where the fuck they are, they...
or something, I don't know.
Just get a fucking move on.
What do you wanna do? It's too early to call.
Can we go to the beach?
What for?
- I wanna see the sea.
Huh, come on then.
Who's that?
- Open the door, it's Derek.
6 in the fucking morning
- I know what time it is,...the fucking door!
All right, all right, hold on, coming down
He said he's coming down.
So you haven't heard from her then?
I told you, I've only met the girl twice.
Well come on, let's have it.
It's my Dads.
Well he ain't gonna need it
for another 10 years, is he?
Fuck off Derek!
If he finds out, he'll go mental.
- I am only borrowing it.
He ain't gonna find out, unless you tell him.
I don't fucking believe this!
What you gonna do with it?
I'll take it on me in case they find out.
You all right?
It fucking pains, look at my fucking leg.
You want shells?
What else am I gonna fire out of it?
I want it on me, in case
Stewart Allen comes after me.
I'll kill her my self, that stupid and their
stupid fucking heads get me in this mess.
Maybe you should just give them to Allen.
Finish your coffee, I am going back to bed.
Make sure you'll bring it back.
I love this flat.
Lucky cunt.
Oi, hang on, twat.
...don't be stupid, you nutter.
What you doing?

What took you so long?
- What are you talking about?
It's only been an hour since you called me
Well, I did tell you it was fucking urgent.
Well, I didn't have the money for a cab, did I?
So I had to get a bus.
You got Even? For me?
- I only saw her this morning, I don't know.
Go on.
Duncan Allen.
- Yeah?
Do you know who he is?
- Yeah, of course I do.
Chum.
Yeah?
- Go sit in the car.
What for?
Because I'm talking to Kelly, and
I want a bit of fucking privacy.
Take your phone with you, so I can call ya.
Yeah, ok.
Right, this goes no further.
Ok? This is between you and me
- What is?
Duncan Allan.
He wants a girl.
- All right.
What, me?
- No, he wants a young girl
How young?
Younger than you! I dunno.

Doesn't matter what he is, does it?
He wants something young and he asked me
to get it for him.
Yeah, but a kid?
Look, don't start Kelly.
I need to find a girl,
and I need her for tonight
Well, I don't know anyone, do I?
Well you're gonna have to go
find someone then, ain't you?
No, I ain't doing that, no fucking way.
Don't be fucking silly, yes you are.
I'll give you 200 quid.
It's a little girl, Derek.
- I know it is.
He asked me, and I do fucking know.
Look, if I don't find it, he'll go and get
one from somebody, so I might as well do it.
All right, he won't come back here, will he?
I don't want to fuck him off, do I?
I don't know, where would I find someone?
Can't go and fucking kidnap some kid, can I?
- You don't have to, do you?
All right? You gonna give her some money
Go down Waterloo and the Embankment, you'll
find a runaway, they'll need the money.
I want more than 200 quid.
Bollocks! Allrigh look, I am gonna have
to give her at least a hundred, ain't I?
I dunno.
Look, find someone who's
been doing it for a while.
If she's out on the streets, she's
bound another bit, ain't she?
Kelly, if I don't find someone, I'm banging
the shit, so help me out a bit please,
I fucking helped you enough times, ain't I?
I'll have a look.
I'm picking some fucking innocent.
- Well, you don't have to, do you?

Get a fucking move on!
Stop crying
Come on, pack it in
You want a cigarette?
Thank you
What's your name?
Joanne
When did you start smoking, Joanne?
Come on, when did you start smoking?
I don't know
Please
What are you gonna do to me?
Do your Mum and Dad smoke?
My Mum's dead
My Dad did
My Dad smokes
You know my Dad, don't you?
I've found some cigarettes,
that belonged to my Dad once
I was probably about half your age
I took one
And I smoked it in the toilet upstairs
He caught me
As a punishment, he made me eat the whole packet
Everything
Felt as
Cardboard
Little bit of silver paper you get inside
He sat there..
..and watched me eat the lot
I was throwing up every 2 seconds
He just...watched me
Didn't look away
I never smoked again
Give it here
What did he do to you then?
Last night?
Is he dead?
Your Dad?
I am sorry Shut up!
Stop crying
Why don't you just tell me what happened?
What did he do to you?
I am not gonna ask you again,
what did he fucking do to you?
I can't remember
It was last night
Remember
He took me to his bedroom
And what?
He kissed me for a bit
Then he put me on the bed
Did he tie you up?
Yeah
Then he got a knife
He said he wouldn't hurt me
I screamed
I wanted to get out
What did he do with the knife?
He was cutting my clothes
Then what? Did you fuck him?
No
Why not?
Kelly came up
She untied me
Did you stab him?
Stop crying
Stop crying!
Did you stab him?
Yes
How many times?
Come on, how many fucking times?
I think it was two
You stabbed my Dad twice?
Sorry
I'm sorry
What are you gonna do to me?
KELLY
Please
What's he gonna do?
JOANNE, JOANNE
Kelly, help me
Kelly, help me
Kelly, help
All right you two, that's deep enough
You fucking...
Kelly, help!

Kelly
Where the fuck are you going?
You're watching this
Joanne, come here!
Noo!

No, please...
Shut up!
My Dad's dead
Someone's gotta pay for that
Don't you fucking move, Derek!
Joanne, take the trigger
Take the fucking trigger now
Pull it
No
Please

Do it.

Pull the fucking trigger, do it!

Go back to your car.

It's just a bit.
