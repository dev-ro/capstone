THE GATE OF HELL
More than 800 years ago, at
the end of the year of Heiji...
...emperor Taira Kiyomori,
with some men of confidence...
...went towards the
temple of ltsukushima.
Taking advantage of it, Yoshitomo
Minamoto and Nobuyori Fujiwara...
...attacked the castle of Sanjo,
residence of the emperor in Kyoto...
...to organize a coup d'Ã©tat.
That clash is known today
as the War of the Heiji.
The south flank has fallen!
We have lost!
Yoshitomo and Nobuyori have
organized the attack.
They have made use of the
absence of Kiyomori.
It's necessary to save the family in the
garden. They must leave for Rokuhara.
Yes!
Take the father and the sister of
the emperor to a safe place.
Use volunteers to confuse the enemy.
Get out of the fortress.
Let's not lose any time!
Who wants to pass as the
sister of the emperor?
It's very important.
A volunteer! Please!
- It will be a pleasure and an honor.
- Who are you?
- My name is Kesa, Master.
- Good. Your cart will be protected by Moritou.
There goes the sister of the emperor.
Come on!
Is anybody here?
Grandfather!
Grandfather. Where are you? Kakisuke!
Are you alright?
Wake up. This is the house of my family.
Here you will be safe.
You stay here.
I must return to Sanjo.
- Who are you?
- Rokurou of Mutsu.
- Rokurou? I haven't heard about you.
- And Moritada?
- My brother is not here.
- I will wait for him.
Trust me. I'm under the
orders of Samanokami.
Samanokami? And why do you
want to see my brother?
Your brother has done a good job.
Both Samanokami and Uemon...
- ...They are very satisfied with him.
- Has he collaborated with the rebels?
Who is that girl?
Which girl?
She's the sister of the former emperor.
Her clothes show it.
- Idiot!
- You are indeed the brother of Moritada?
Both Moritou and I have the blood of Endo.
And I am faithful to the emperor!
Curses!
- Moritou!
- Stop it!
Brother! Aren't you ashamed
to support the rebellion?
Moritou, calm down! The world has
changed completely since yesterday.
They chopped off the head
of priest Shinzei.
Also, Rokuhara is surrounded
by Yoshitomo's elite.
Brother! Please reconsider!
You have never been one of them!
I have my own opinion.What does it
serve to be faithful to Kiyomori?
When you swear allegiance to a man,
he is your master!
Only cowards would betray
him in his absence!
It's not cowardice. Don't be mistaken.
I do it for my own interest.
You will never win! We will annihilate you!
Never!
Being my brother will save you.
Don't touch him! I want you to know
that the route to the west is blocked.
Join us. Come on.
Let's not waste any more time.
The head of priest Shinzei hangs
outside the Gate of Hell!
Let's get out of here!
- Is it really the head of priest Shinzei?
- Yes. We are all going to see it! Come on!
- The worst is already over, but the father...
...and the sister of the emperor
are prisoners of the enemy.
And the head of priest Shinzei hangs by
the Gate of Hell.
Surely Shinzei didn't expect
to hang by the gate.
During the Houguen-war, he did the
same with hundreds of heads...
...and he put the names on the door.
He has fully deserved it.
Look! Nobuyori, one of the chiefs of the
riot, has come to admire his trophy!
We better not stay here!
Master, they are all afraid of you.
Moritou!
Koguenta. What do you know about Rokuhara?
I heard that he besieged Yoshitomo.
- What is it?
- Are you just like your brother?
- Why do you say that?
- His treacherous head has a price on it!
- If you are like him, I will kill you!
- That's foolish! I'm not like him!
Moritou. Can you prove it?
Yes. I will go and see Kiyomori
on the island of Itsukushima.
To Itsukushima? Go if you want.
Heiroku and Tadatsuna will go there too.
Heiroku too?
What?
Father!
Why did you allow Nobuyori
to build the castle?
And what do you know about
my father and sister?
- Well...
- You don't know what to say! Call Moritou!
Yes, master.
Rokuhara is also in danger.
I'm surrounded by useless fools!
The head of Shinzei hangs
by the Gate of Hell?
That's not all. Your father and sister...
- Have they been taken as prisoners?
- Yes. They tried to flee, but got caught.
- Who participated?
- Nobusumi, of the Sou-clan, and...
...Kanenari Sakagami. Right?
Yes.
My brother Moritada was in on it as well.
Your brother too?
That is all. You may go.
We don't have a minute to loose.
We must return to the house.
- I  know. But how?
- Father.
Moritou is right. If you're in doubt now,
you will always repent.
We have no armor. How
are we going to fight?
For the time being, as a
precaution, the armor...
...is secretly hidden in our baggage.
- So you brought them?
- Yes. As a precaution.
Moritou. You may go.
Where are you going?
The great Kiyomori entered the capital
with his troops, and defeated...
...the soldiers of Nobuyori and Yoshimoto
by The Gate of Taiken's, in Rokuhara.
This was at the beginning of the year of Eireki,
the year of the dragon.
The Taira-clan recaptured
the control of the country.
Yes, there it is!
The name of Rokurou of Mutsu,
whom I killed in Taiken!
Don't talk nonsense!
It was I who cut his neck!
Seriously? You could have killed
Shichirou of Mutsu, his twin.
Nobuyori didn't believe that Kiyomori
would recover the country in one month.
There won't be any war for a long time.
DEAD IN COMBAT
Moritou. Light a little incense
for your brother.
The poor bastard!
Tomorrow Rokuhara's awards
is announced.
- I will ask them for a new armor.
- You think they will give it to you...
...who did so little?
It's you! This is incredible!
- It's you.
- I am glad to see that you're alive.
- Thanks for your help.
- It was nothing.
I have no relatives buried here, but
wanted to pray for the victims.
This is my aunt.
- I am Sawa, to your service.
- Where do you hail from?
- From the village of Shirakawa.
- The place with many chestnuts?
Yes. In autumn the mountain
hillside is covered with them.
And was she also born
in this village?
Kesa was raised in our humble
house since birth.
So Kesa is your niece?
When she started her employment at the
castle, the sister of the emperor...
...gave her this name, master.
That's a nice name.
In the court she is considered popular.
She is the favorite of the sister...
- ...of the emperor.
- Aunt...
Why don't you come to my house?
I will offer you something to eat.
Thank you, master, but Kesa must return
to her work at the castle right away.
- They're waiting for her there.
- I see! That's a shame.
Perhaps another day, when
things are calmer.
Moritou, she is a courtesan, right?
Sadafusa, for your acts, I name you
chief of Ise and grant you a horse.
- I am very grateful to you, master.
- The next one is Tomoyuki.
Tomoyuki!
I give you the country estate
of Gokanosho in Tajima.
Thank you very much.
- Koguenta.
- Yes.
- I believe that you wanted to ask me for
something.- Yes. The sword of Hachijin...
- ...and the doll Tsukune that you adore.
- It is strange, but I grant them to you!
- Thank you.
- Approach, Moritou.
Yes.
In spite of the treachery of your brother,
you killed Masanaka, and fought well...
...by The Gates of Taiken.
Ask of me what you wish.
- Will you grant what I ask of you?
- Kiyomori always fulfills his word.
Unless you ask for my neck!
I want you, master Kiyomori, to be
the godfather of my wedding.
- Godfather of your wedding?
- Yes.
Very well. So be it.
Whom do you want to marry?
She works for your sister.
Her name is Kesa, and I love her.
Kesa? I don't remember her.
But I'm sure she is attractive.
I will put you in touch
with her residence.
Thank you. You make me very happy.
Why do you laugh? Few would show
value enough to admit his feelings.
Moritou, your wish will be granted.
Master! Kesa is the wife of Wataru Watanabe.
She is employed at the castle.
Moritou, you heard it.
Kesa is already married.
Bad luck!
You will have to look for another one!
I appeal to the imperial power in order
that they grant me this girl as a wife!
- Impossible.
- Fulfill your word!
She is married, so it is impossible. Are there
no other desires that you want to realize?
Moritou, why don't you answer?
I see.
How do you want me
to explain it for you?
What are you doing?
I've already cleaned that.
Relax. I was getting bored.
Leave it already, Kesa. Why do
you clean as a housekeeper?
You know that I always liked dealing with
the house. Tone, you continue.
Yes.
Although you do not realize, Kesa,
sometimes you are too obtainable.
Don't you know anything about the
rumour that runs in Rokuhara?
Apparently, everybody in the city
speak about the same thing.
A soldier of lower rank, as
an award to his services...
...asked the emperor permissioin to marry you.
He sweared he was in love.
It's incredible. How can he fall in
love with a married woman?
His name is Moritou and is of rural
origin. What was he thinking?
Her husband laughed when he
heard it, before going to work.
- Tone, it's not appropriate to make fun.
- No. The topic is quite serious...
...and your husband will worry.
Nobody will make fun of you about this.
The Fujiwara-clan is very
noble and respectable.
Also, the brother of this man, was
one of the traitors in the rebellion.
I prefer not to speak about the topic.
The freshness of some people
is hard to believe.
Listen to me, Kesa, a great lady
must be elegant and reserved.
Otherwise, you might have
many problems.
It seems like the master
has already returned.
- Is our neighbor here again?
- Yes. I think she gets bored in her house.
- Welcome home.
- Has miss Mano left already?
Yes. She visits me frequently and shows
me how the wife of a samurai should act.
I am very grateful to her.
Master, your face is pale.
- I am well. Do not worry.
- Are you sure? Does anything worry you?
- Why do you ask?
- I know of an absurd rumour...
...that you undoubtedly
must have heard.
- I feel bad about it.
- Is this about Moritou?
Yes. I have never given him hopes, but
he could have seen something in me...
...that has impelled him to act like that.
I feel responsible.
Do not worry.
It's not your fault.
It does not surprise me that
your beauty was blinding him.
But you are my wife, and Moritou
will never be able to approach you.
I was hoping to hear that
from you, noble master.
But you must understand my worries.
We samurai may be tough, but we
do have feelings...
...and a sense of humor too!
Give me a smile!
- There it is!
- Such foolishness.
Have a little sake.
Drink a little with me.
Yes. And if you get drunk, I will use the
opportunity to ask you for many things.
You little devil...
A messenger says the emperor want to see
the lady of the house as soon as possible.
- Me?
- Yes.
Tell him that I am sick and
that I cannot get up.
No.
It would be inappropriate to not
answer the call of the emperor.
In addition of you taking care of his sister,
he is also the one that employs you.
It will be better that you go.
What does he want of me?
I have a bad foreboding.
- Stop worrying. Tone!
- Yes.
- Tell him the lady accepts the invitation.
- Yes.
I understand now.
- Is Moritou here?
- Yes.
Go get him.
I'll be around.
Do you hear that?
The one playing the Koto is Kesa.
Since you want her so much, I have
decided to give you a chance.
If she loves you, she is yours.
But if she opposes, you will forget
about her. And do not push it.
On your way. Go and see her.
What's wrong with you?
Such a coward!
Where is your staunch valor now?
I am not afraid!
With your permission!
It will be a big disappointment, for
such a pig-headed fool!
Master, I believe you have gone too far.
Enough!
Please!
Enough!
I am unable to lie. When I told
Kiyomori about my desire...
...I didn't know you were married.
And I cannot abandon you.
- What you want is impossible.
- I know it seems impossible.
Kesa, if you give me your heart, I will
be the best husband in the world!
- That cannot be!
- Why not?
Because I'm married and I
already have a husband.
Perhaps I am of lower rank
than your husband?
Let me go, please.
Kesa...
Kesa, the master wants you.
Wataru...what do you think?
I suppose it doesn't worry you that
this peasant from Rokuhara...
- ...has fallen in love with your wife!
- Why would it? Your marriage is great!
Why would you worry about this Moritou?
Stop arguing! We are here as
guests, for the horse-race...
...tomorrow. So let's change topics.
You are single, and these conversations
always make you blush!
- Me?
- Yes!
Have you heard the lastest news? That
Rokuhara-idiot has done it again!
- Moritou?
- What has he done?
He has registered for the
horse-race tomorrow!
- Does he want to compete with Wataru?
- This will be interesting!
Don't be stupid! This type is a brute! And
in his state, he is capable of anything!
Wataru, if you want, I will
take part for you.
No! Wataru is very good! Last
year he won the competition.
Don't think he's going to lose
before this poor wretch!
Right, Wataru?
It's only a competition. A race
in homage to the gods.
Regardless of who my competitors are,
I will always act sportingly.
I don't agree!
This race is very important!
You must win to defend your name. 
You speak about sportsmanship
against a man who hates you!
- You have to win!
- No. The gods will decide who wins.
The Endo are also samurai.
I'm sure his heart is noble.
Nevertheless, tomorrow promises to
be interesting. It will be exciting.
- Tone. Has Kesa returned?
- Yes, she came in a little while ago.
I didn't know you had returned.
Why did he call you?
What is it?
He called me only to test my feelings.
Your feelings?
Kiyomori had set up a
meeting with Moritou!
- And?
- I clearly told him no, but...
I felt so humiliated!
I understand. I am proud.
Feelings cannot be changed by force.
Kiyomori and Moritou have learned their
lesson. Come, don't cry anymore.
I want you to rest for tomorrow.
It will be an entertaining day.
They said that Moritou
will compete with you.
It's the tournament of the gods. I will
compete and I will do the best I can.
Is it essential that you take part?
Do not worry.
I will surely win this year too.
Kesa, whatever happens,you must
remain calm, or people will talk.
- Yes.
- Let's go in the garden to watch the moon.
Have all your friends retired already?
Yes, after too much talk and
too much drinking!
Kesa. I won't let you leave me.
Understood?
Tomorrow will be a very fine day.
Isn't that Wataru Watanabe?
Yes. It's Wataru.
- I will crush him!
- Moritou! You must play fair!
I know that already! I will give him
a lesson and they will all value me.
- Kakisuke.
- Yes?
See if they win the red
or the violet ones.
- They won the red ones.
- We'll win for sure!
Moritou! Play fair!
Yes.
- This is getting interesting.
- This is the best race yet!
The protagonists of the scandal
competing face to face!
Moritou has won!
Moritou is the winner!
Good boy.
- Let's go.
- Marvellously fought, Moritou!
I don't understand. You should
have whipped the horse more!
- Did you let him win?
- Foolishness! He was better than me.
I  just don't get it.
Master, your wife told me to tell
you that she is waiting for you.
Very well.
With this the ceremony
of conciliation finishes.
Now the holiday begins.
Once in a year, the samurai...
...of the diverse houses amuse
themselves together. To divert power.
It certainly was an
interesting competition!
I am sure  Wataru allowed him to win.
- Everybody saw it.
- Wataru giving him the lead...
...is like saying that this is
the only thing I'll give you!
That's true.
He hardly used his whip!
Right, Wataru?
- No. He was better than me.
- Come on! Tell the truth.
He wouldn't have won otherwise!
That's enough! If you believe
that I was given the victory...
...then let's do it again!
- Interesting. Another competition?
- Sure. You can fight in the garden.
Yes! And if necessary, we duel!
Wataru!
Let's go the garden! The ones that
think you allowed me to win...
...will have to answer before my sword!
Moritou. Do you forget the meaning of
this holiday? You will not use violence!
Get out. Away!
Idiot!
It Is unworthy of a samurai to lose
control because of a woman.
Go home!
Lady! You must hide!
Tone? What's going on?
The samurai Moritou of
the Endo-clan is here...
...and he wants to meet you, because he
wants to ask you something important.
- And what did you tell him?
- That the owner of the house was out...
...and the lady was out and hasn't returned.
But he said that he won't go away...
...until you return or I tell
him where to find you.
I have talked to the person that
accompanied the lady to the door.
The lady has gone to visit her aunt
and will probable not return today.
- She went to her aunt?
- Yes.
Very well!
I know that your niece is here!
They told me so at the Watanabe-house!
- I can assure you that she's not here.
- Enough! I will search the house.
Nevertheless, you won't find
her because she's not here.
- Are you lying to me?
- Why would I lie to you?
So she was in the house
all the time!
This can't continue.
Of course. Call your niece.
I need to see her.
- That is impossible.
- It is a matter of life and death.
She is the lady of the Watanabe-house.
I cannot call her on a whim.
- I order you to do it!
- Master, please...
- Do you refuse?
- Yes.
In that case, I will kill all your
relatives! One by one!
Master, even though I would request it,
it is not certain that Kesa comes.
If you send a messenge saying you're
in your death-bed, she will come!
- But I don't want to lie!
- Do you prefer to die?
Hello. I didn't known
that you'd returned.
What wrong? They said that
you spend all your time here.
- Yes.
- A messenger has arrived saying...
- ...that your aunt wants to see you, she is ill.
- My aunt is ill...?
- Do you want me to go and see her?
- No. It's me who should visit her.
Of course.
But don't go without company.
If her condition doesn't improve,
I will go and see her too.
The poor woman must feel lonely.
Be careful.
Yes.
Thanks for accompanying me.
Hello, aunt.
- Kesa has come.
- Light a lantern.
Hello, Kesa. Your aunt isn't sick.
Don't worry.
I'm sorry. I didn't want to call for you,
but he forced me with threats.
- Please, leave us alone.
- Master, don't ruin her honor.
Leave us.
Finally I get to see you.
I don't know what you could
possibly want from me.
I have made you come so that you
may listen to the voice of my heart.
Master, that which roots in your
heart will not change anything.
Kesa, I resign from everything I have.
Only you matters to me.
Why don't you take my 
feelings seriously?
Enough!
You saved my life once, and
for that I am grateful.
What are you doing?
- Are you sure you don't want me?
- Yes.
Now we'll see!
Deep inside, you know you are mine.
I will never surrender to you.
I am an honest woman.
- Leave your husband. Leave Wataru!
- Never!
Leave him. If not I will kill him!
And not only Wataru, but your aunt also!
Even you!
I am capable of killing you all!
Do you try to get me
by threatening me?
That's how things are. I can't
go on living without you!
What do you say?
Do you still resist?
Come on! Answer me!
Do you want Wataru, your aunt,
and even yourself to die?
Kesa, everything depends on your answer!
Please, let me go.
Yes.
Agreed. I will be yours.
You have listened to my heart.
But, in return, you will leave 
my husband alone!
I will kill him!
- It will be tonight.
- Yes.
- Will you help me?
- Yes.
Good. At 9 o'clock, turn off the
light in Wataru's room.
If you disobey me, I will kill all of you!
If you move even a step out of
this house, I will cut your neck!
Yes.
Oh! You're back already.
- Where is my husband?
- Not long ago I saw him in there, reading.
Really?
Is your aunt seriously ill, mylady?
No. She will be fine.
I am glad.
I was very worried.
Tone? Will you prepare some sake?
Of course.
When you have prepared it,
you can retire to your room.
Very well.
Tone. Wait.
- I want to give you this.
- It is a very valuable gift.
- Keep it as a memory.
- Yes. I will always have it with me.
- Kesa?
- Hello. I am sorry to be so late.
How is your aunt?
It seems to me that she was feeling
lonely, and that my visit revived her.
That makes me happy.
- Go to bed. I will come soon.
- No. I am too scared to go to bed.
- I'm afraid that someone will be there.
- What an absurd thought.
- It is a bad foreboding.
- I will take a look.
I don't see anybody.
It must have been my imagination.
- Have some sake.
- What's going on?
Nothing.
- Are you worried about your aunt?
- No.
Tell me what worries you.
- Today I'm not concerned about anything.
- I hope so.
Some music is always good for the mood.
Why don't you play something to me?
Yes.
Why do you play such a sad tune?
Are you crying?
- No.
- I believe you are tired.
- Why don't you take a little sake?
- Yes. I will take a little.
I have never seen you gulp it down so fast!
- Let's go to sleep.
- No. Let's stay awake a little bit more.
And tonight, please
rest in my room.
- Sleep here?
- Yes.
Good, I will lie down and
listen to your music.
- What time would you say it is?
- It's almost 9 o'clock.
9 o'clock?
Take care of yourself.
Die!
Kesa...
Kesa...
My God!
I never imagined that you
would do this for him!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, Kesa!
To think that a wretch such as I have
plucked you in the full blossom of life!
I didn't understand that your heart
would always be faithful!
I am an idiot and a
miserable poor wretch!
Wataru. Where are you?
Where are you?
Wataru!
Wataru!
Wataru!
Moritou!
- Wataru. Cut my neck!
- What?!
Love has maddened me! Believing
it was you, I have killed Kesa!
To her it was a shame to be loved by me.
She has sacrificed herself by
putting herself in your place.
It was wonderful.
And you have before you
the wretch who killed her.
How could I believe that I might
conquer her heart by force?
Idiot!
Finish me. Cut me to pieces.
Kill me as you want.
Kesa!
Was that a farewell?
Why didn't you tell me?
Did you think it would make me
happy to see you like that?
Kesa. Listen to me for last time.
What a husband expects from
his wife is total confidence.
Why did you not rely on me, my love?
Why did you not dare to ask me for help?
Wataru. Give me what I have well deserved.
You must finish me off for being
the most miserable of men!
Don't you hate me?
I have killed your wife!
Why don't you unleash all your anger on me?
- The life is hard.
- What?
Even if I was to cut your neck,
Kesa would not return to life.
The killer of your wife deserves
death! So cut my neck!
If I kill you, as you ask of me, your
penance would have ended.
But, what will become of
me after this tragedy?
Knowing that my wife not even trusted
enough in me to prevent her death.
What is going to become of me now?
Wataru, you are right.
I will dedicate my life to suffer
for what I have done.
Today is the first day
of a life of sacrifices.
Moritou will be a disgrace
up to his death.
Kesa...
THE END
