Who could carress time?
Get us out of here!
Get us out of here!
Is it the substance that is
heavy, or the meaning?
The cops are coming
As the sun was coming
out of the clouds...
...colors of the rainbow made love
on the rooftops of Cholera.
The church bells mingled
with the morning prayer and...
...a slight scent of opium filled the air.
While the emperors were
majestically puffing their joints...
...the poetic spirit of Adam
Mickiewichz rose from...
...his hundred year old cell, clung
onto the smoke and perched...
...on the cross of the church.
The solemn hookers were rolling...
...their roaches to get real high.
Is the roach ready?
Here she comes.
I usually don’t give it to slobs
like you, but just this once.
You give it to me once and
you won't need anybody else.
Stop bullshitting and stick it in.
I will.
That’s enough, pull it out.
Shut up so I enjoy a little.
So you’re partying again?
Some usual stuff only brother.
- Look at the babe, look how
she's wriggling that ass.
That’s enough of you.
Get the fuck out of here.
Men think they
come here to stay.
Now give me the
cash and out!
Cash? The boss never gives cash
only takes it. You got it?
Get out of here!
What the fuck is this?
You will never be horny again. All
babes will be after you to get laid.
Go dump your filthy water
down the loo, bitch!
What loo, jerk, leave me alone.
You should be thankful, its
fertility showed upon you.
Since when you talk like this?
So sexy when you get pissed!
Stop bullshitting. Are you done?
Of course I am.
Melt the dent gently. I'll take
my girl around and be back son.
Tibi, you made Sermin
look ravishing again.
Of course I did. She’s the only
one for me in the whole world.
Come on, fuck me,
bite me...
A real man you are, you deserve
all the babes in the world.
And you’re a real babe, what
a body you have.
Get lost and do your bullshitting
somewhere else you son of a bitch.
Dad.
What is it?
I made coffee for you baby.
Come get it honey.
I guess I fucked it up Arap.
Never mind. What’s a small cut...
...to a man like me.
Hurry up, give me the styptic.
Here you go, express service.
And the compress.
Here you are.
Dad.
Eleni.
Get your thins and come Ali,
the Boss is waiting for you.
If that bastard wants a shave,
tell him to come here.
Up to you. The Boss gets irritable
if he doesn’t get the best shave.
Clear of it or l'll
kick his ass.
I’ll tell him you say hello.
These new guys are becoming
a pain in the ass lately.
Its a fucked up
world we live in.
Do you want tea?
Thanks Id better go.
- Lodger was going to drop by.
- I'll be back in half an hour.
Just keep it in your pocket.
you always say the same thing.
That’s a nice shave, Arap.
Take it to mum and back to work.
OK Dad.
You have to work hard and be
a man. Go bring the balloon.
Here you are.
Foam it.
I’ll rent the flat upstairs.
What are you talking about.
Its a woman, an escort,
Sados friend.
Sado, my man, he’s one of a kind.
There’s no one like him anymore.
Ne?
No more of his kind.
Do you remember Razor Niyazi?
Sure, he was a real man.
Arap was one of his men,
he learned everything from Niyazi.
We learned it all from Niyazi. How to walk,
how to steal from rich...
...and give it to poor. Foam
it well so beard gets softer.
Sure I’ll be better than you.
Don’t get carried away now.
Stop bullshitting and start shaving,
if it gets torn I’ll break your skull.
Its not your arm but your
wrist that should move.
Everything gets worse day by
day Tibi. Its all corrupt now.
Sados right. Our world
has become a shitty place.
You son of a bitch, you
useless motherfucker.
You shouldn’t run away from your
master if he decides to punish you.
Either you obey him or
I’ll kick your ass.
Morning Tibi.
Ali, you refused to have tea with
me, so I came here to have some.
Cut it out and sit if
you want a shave.
OK, a smooth shave.
Foam his face.
Why are you so edgy, you have
such a beautiful shop and...
...a perfect location.
Don’t move or you’ll get cut.
- But...
- Shut up, just have your shave...
... like eveybody else,
then get out of here.
Is this Tayyare Street, No 117?
Tayyare to you, we call it Cholera.
Shall we carry those?
Second floor, on the barbers.
- Be careful.
- Don't worry brother.
Welcome Tina.
Thank you.
I’ll introduce you to
your landlord.
Ali, this is sister Tina,
your new lodger.
Welcome sister.
Nice to meet you.
take a seat, the house is yours
as long as Sado is your friend.
How about coffee?
Sure. How would you like it?
With little sugar.
Go get it.
Have cigarette.
I have my own.
This is my elder son,
and this is the younger one.
- Be careful with the furniture.
- It'll only take a minute.
What a lousy job you’re
doing. Hurry up!
- Let me look upstairs.
- Your coffee?
- Later.
- This way then.
Its always something...
OK, Nihat, don’t make fuss.
- I'll open the door for you.
- Pick me up at 10.
I’ll be there.
Fuck off!
Is that bike yours?
Now its yours.
Really?
Of course.
Stop playing and eat.
Death on you!
I gave you a home and a job,
and yet you are so ungrateful...
Don’t hit the child.
Aliko...
Stop playing with the food.
I’m telling you to cut that out!
Shut up! You cant even let me
enjoy a meal and raki at my house.
Aliko! How are you doing?
Welcome to our neighborhood,
madam. I am the Boss.
Come in. Such nice flowers.
You are so kind.
As much as I am kind, I am also
very irritable. Its my nature.
So its from birth. Too bad.
And I can become very upset...
...when I get irritable.
So you’re sensitive too.
I’m most sensitive
about obedience.
How would you like your coffee?
Stop feigning naive...
... I’m getting pissed.
So you’ll ask me to pay you half...
...of what I make so that you
wont get pissed, right?
I was just kidding honey...
Get out of here motherfucker!
So you’re a smart woman, if you
don’t want to loose your goldmine...
...you do just what you said
and pay me, OK?
This is my turf
and I rule here.
OK Nihat, I’m coming.
Are you trying to get high?
I’m going to get away from
this hell called Cholera Street.
Pals, listen to me!
Come join my table of
pleasure, reach out for me.
The women from outer space
have the same problems.
They screw around like the women
here, but they do it in their...
...husbands spaceships. You
mistake them for comets, you fool.
You think they’re different, but
they are as horny as women here.
Last night I met one who
was planet hopping...
...and I invented a way
to pin her to bed.
Later I found out that her husband
works in an anti-communist team...
...and because he’s always tired,
what can the poor woman do?
In short, women in other galaxies
all have the same problem.
A woman is a
woman everywhere.
This is a respectable bar,
behave yourselves!
No one's being disrespectful
to your table.
Act like a gentleman, obey the code.
Don’t pay attention to others.
Act according to the rules. You’re
still young, you might be taken out.
Get the fuck out of here.
As you wish. Lets get out.
Can you throw her that high?
No problem!
Can she reach it?
I can throw a cat as high as stars.
Come on girl. Fly now.
Show me what you can do.
Stop! Leave
that rug!
Put them down or
I'll cut your ears!
Salih!
Aren’t you ashamed of yourselves!
Have mercy on us, brother!
No mercy for what you’ve done.
Don’t bust their balls if they
beg for mercy, Salih.
Come here you bugger.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Let's toast to Salih and his courage.
- Bravo! The man has guts!
While he was weaving a life of endless
miracles...
...he could not know that his tricycle
would end up in the gutter soon.
The gossip of Cholera
told the news to Tina...
...every detail of how Salih busted
the kids and got the rug back.
Didn’t I tell you he
grabbed the rug?
You are one strong man.
Thank you. Good night.
Well done, young man.
Be all ears and listen to me.
I am the stop that
I am Gaftici Fethi...
...sexology professor
at Colera Universty.
I am going to give you vitally
important tips about babes, listen!
Get the light bulb ready.
If the babe starts telling
she wants to marry you...
...first look into the light
from his distance.
Cut it! Then look
into her eyes.
If you can still see the
wenchs eyes, marry her.
That means shell love you
till the end of the world!
End of class.
Now get lost!
- My brother, what's happened?
- It's metal dust!
I gave you a job, so you’ll learn
a craft. You not only got...
...the bar stolen but made yourself
blind. You useless pig! Fuck off!
Why do you hit him?
What bar?
The bar of the 1957 model car.
I didn’t get that stolen, I told you.
Are you still talking back?
I’m gonna tear your tongue out!
Then you’ll be both blind and
mute and unemployed!
God job! Use that now!
As the echo of your fame was
telling of your scarlet rage...
..time stood still for you.
You were a lover to be envied.
That beauty of yours.
for the time being,
you are alive...
...until the day you die.
Stop playing with that! Its not
a toy! It’ll hurt you and you’ll see.
Go away now.
What’s up?
Come upstairs!
- What is this?
- You'll see when you come.
Come closer.
Shame on you! Its my tough
luck my blood brother is gay.
Nobody’s perfect.
This is my last
offer. 2,000.
This asshole is so greedy,
now he wants my tiny stable.
The new guys on the block
were full of shit...
...a disgrace for the old masters.
Tibi, although not suffering from...
...loneliness, was
all alone after all.
I am selling this stable to the
Boss for 2,000 Liras. Sign it.
Even doors work more.
Sing it!
As you wish,
my friend.
What are you
doing? Stop!!
I will sign. Stop!!
What a delicate thing
this Sermin must be.
Let me have
a go at her too!
You were a pair of wings
in the winds of agony...
...your angels turned into thin air
in the mountains beyond the white.
It will be Cholera crying
for you, in terror...
Tibi, you real ghost, poor man, now
our prayers to sooth your spirit.
Get out, you fucking pig! Isn’t it
enough you to extorted the innocent...
...honest people? Come challenge
me if you have the guts, asshole!
What’s your fuckin problem?
Come down, I’ll show what!
I’m gonna cut your balls, idiot!
Shut up, or I’ll kick your ass!
Dogs will be picking on your filthy corpse!
Let them fight like men!
You smart ass!
This will be your last dance!
As long as I live here, I wont
even see your shadow...
...or I swear I’ll hang you
from your balls!
He will, watch out!
This is delicious,
brothel dessert.
What’s up? What’s he thinking of?
He’s broke...
...wondering
who to rip off.
What is it? What’s up?
Come! Were gonna be rich!
You're gonna burn yourself!
Send the tinner here so
well get high too.
He’s got another
bright idea of his.
Were going to be loaded!
I’ll write it and you’ll illustrate it.
What are you talking about?
A book!
What book?
Shut the window...
...and let me put this on.
What is it?
Check the oil.
- She's not that ugly.
- Babes are more beautiful at night.
How can you stop your son
from becoming gay?
If you want to know,
read this invaluable book!
How can you stop your son
from becoming gay? Bullshit!
This is a job you bastards do!
Its a job, earns me money.
Don’t hit him in the head,
it’ll make him dumb!
You shut the fuck up!
Dad!
You shut up too!
Dad! Don’t!
You’ll never grow up to real men!
Take this, in case you need it.
- Aleko, I waited for you 15 years.
- My life is wasted on my family...
...for kids. I don’t even remember
the time I was young.
Just keep it in your pocket.
Don’t hangout here. Its a dive.
They’re all divers, aren’t they?
Don’t let your father know
you hang out here.
I’m a man. I can go
anywhere I like.
Brother Ali, why don't you even look at me?
Ali! Why don’t you
say hello, What’s up?
Brother, can't
you even say hi?
And how was Eleni?
Good?
What is it?
she’s been stabbed.
its fate. You
cant escape it.
That bastard, the Boss,
he was supposed to have left.
Do you think it was him?
It must be him, I’m sure.
No, it must be somebody else.
This killer is a real monster.
- What monster?
- Killer! The Cholera Monster!
Horrible murder!
Cholera Monster strikes!!
Aren’t you done yet?
The man is waiting for his car.
I need a piece,
it doesn’t work yet.
Just go and steal then.
Haven’t you learnt the art yet?
No more to steal.
We finished the poet yet.
I don’t care, go find it. I’ll take care
my girl out, so finish the job.
Have you forgotten what you say?
Just keep it in your pocket.
Too late.
Do you have eyes in the
back of your head?
Can I be of any service?
Thank you, see you.
See you later.
Is that for me?
Of course.
Then give it to me.
I will but in a more...
...appropriate place.
Come with me then.
Be smart and learn the craft
while your master is not here.
Baby, don't rush,
on second.
First the necklace,
then I’ll do you.
I’m the man now.
I want to do the welding now
Don’t touch the button.
Come on, I cant
wait, stick it in.
Watch out, the weld
is sucking in.
Step back!
They are burning.
The kids are inside.
Orhan is there.
My car is burning.
Rescue those people,
isn’t there a brave man here?
I’m coming Orhan!
Stop! You’ll
get killed!
Carry the young man,
he needs help.
Oh, baby, what a good
heart, how beautiful...
I should go now.
Stay in bed a little longer,
I’ll make tea for you.
I’m coming.
When my first husband started
to give me shit, I grabbed the kid...
...and cleared off, the second
one works in a bank.
You mean he works
for a living like us.
Come in gentleman,
all the girls are available.
OK. Leyla, please my man.
Don’t worry, I will.
Girls, here’s our novice.
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8!
- Bravo, young man!
- This is a record in this brothel.
I love your sped, you’re
my man, I will wait for you.
It took you 15 seconds to fuck the
babe. Bravo! Come in gentlemen!
Now I can have my
way with you Tina.
Come over here!
Friends, were collecting hospital
money for Gaftici and Orhan.
Pass it around!
They say you fucked
the bitchs brains out.
Id bust anyone who
badmouths Tina.
Don’t be friendly with everybody.
Its a rotten world.
Everybody’s watching and waiting
for you to make a bad move.
I’ll send this away
and be back.
They did me in.
I’ll rescue you!
Just put it in your pocket.
My knife is yours. Farewell.
This fucking life!
Those bloody bastards!
The world is full of shit!
The good people of Cholera
stood by the still warm body...
...as if to toward off the guards
of the kingdom of death.
While the music played
as the soul left the flesh...
...it sent shivers through
the devout of Cholera.
The honor his Soul,
the women made halva...
...with the drugs Puma Zehra
gave them and that man...
...of great courage, who they thought
would never die, was finally buried.
- Life, using up each of us.
- Don't let it then. You're smart.
Don’t let the false
paradise fool you.
Oh, my poor baby.
My friends. We have a new enter-
tainment center in our street.
Well give the best
service here and...
...everything is free
on this first day.
We are here to give you the best,
and you can make good money.
Don’t trust this man.
He never works honestly.
He killed Sado and Tibi.
He will try to squeeze us...
...now that Sado is dead.
What can we do? I have 4 kids.
I will pay him if we have to.
Shall we complain to the police?
The police would love to see us
fight and kill each other.
Then what can we do?
Get together. Unite against...
...injustice the first time. Unite!
What do you mean unite?
- Stop that communist jargon!
- You are useless!
From now on you will
work for me, OK?
Get out of here, I shouldn’t
invite you for a coffee.
You will be
begging me soon.
Give me a piece.
Do you have money?
Of course.
Give him the money.
Fuck the desert you make!
Assholes! They got
the money too.
Wake up.
Stop beating me!
What beating? Where’s the boy?
What boy?
Watch out boy!
Women are like the sea. You
never know when it will be rough.
She’s not any woman...
She’s a queen.
Get up you asshole!
- Move your ass, bastard!
- Dad don't!
Stop talking, fucker!
Dad!
Calm down, son. We
have rules here.
Shut up! If you’re the rule.
I’m the trouble.
This is what your rules are good
for. Go on blow your whistles!
From now on I’m the law.
Are you nuts man? How could
you pull a knife on your father?
Give it to me.
No future here. You’ll waste your
life with dope addicts, psychopaths.
Come with me. I found a flat,
a job in a magazine.
Well find you a job then we can
have our parents move in too.
This is all fantasy.
Its fantasy here, idiot!
Its fantasy for you, your future
is not here but mine is.
Come on man!
You’ll be wasted!
Come with me!
I cant.
You're an idiot.
Brother!
Whatever it is, this is my life!
Here! I am the Boss from now on!
Lm telling you! I don’t
have any! I swear I don’t!
You weren't saying that when
you asked for a loan, cunt!
I wear I don’t.
Then no one's forcing you here.
You can pay in instalments.
OK, Boss?
25% for a month, OK?
% 25?
Just because we like you!
Have mercy on me!
Leave me! Fuck!
OK. Let him go.
We'll visit you for a coffee.
This is a favor. Appreciate it!
And you stop singing, bitch!
Bravo, Elephant Hamit! What a man!
Neighbors! On the the statue
of an invaluable man is erected...
Ill ask you to help out
with the money...
...out friend need for hospital.
We did hat already, didn't we?
No, we spent it on Sados funeral.
Come on man! For once...
...do something for others!
A great job you did.
Ill be back soon.
Give everybody tea, on me.
Bravo, Salih, I knew you
would become a bright man.
And what a big heart you
have! Look at this bust!
Go home and drink your milk,
who are you to have tea!
Don't fuck with me!
Mind your own business!
But it's you who fucks with me
and messes things up!
What's he saying?
- Listen, little boy. Nobody here...
...can squeeze people, but me.
I am here to protect people.
From now on nobody will
squeeze people in this street.
This is Sados will.
And I will enforce it
With whose help?
On your own?
No, he’s not on his own!
So we have a little
uprising here.
We cant have two
captains on this ship.
Come lets sort that out!
If you have the nerve.
You will pay for this. I will cut
you so badly that even...
...the murderer of Cholera
will get jealous.
Tilki.
- My Brother!
- Salih, you saved my life! Thanks!
What’s wrong with Fethi?
His brain got screwed up.
The fight isn’t over yet.
Thank God you saved your skin.
I’m going home.
Aren’t you coming?
Mdm. Eleni will drop by.
You come to me, tonight.
You left your chain at my place.
I thought I lost it in the fire.
It’ll be a sort of fire.
Will you come?
Well see.
Come on Fethi, it feels so good,
come on, more, you are great!
Your chain is on the table.
There’s no rush. And here’s yours.
How nice, put it on.
I will.
I'll have raki.
What’s written here?
I love you
I don’t know how to say it.
I love you so much I fell sick.
Hope you recover soon.
This’ll be good
for you. Come.
You conquered my heart,
sweet boy, I’m falling for you.
My sons, they
are both gone.
Stop crying, stop.
He was going to be a real man
but lost himself to a whore.
Its love Boss!
What is love of a hooker?
Who is this?
Adam Mmikiewicz. A polish poet.
He used to live here.
In Cholera? Cant believe.
What happened to his hands?
Its a wad.
A wad? Really?
Who is that?
That is... Brutus.
Good looking guy.
He was a paper tiger.
You mean?
He betrayed.
To whom?
Caesar, the emperor,
an important man to us.
That’s the police!
The police?
Get us out of here!
Get out from where?
The kitchen or closet?
Get us out of here!
Is it the substance that is heavy,
or the meaning?
Its all heavy.
That son of a gun! What's up?
There's a storm in my soul.
My knees are shaking.
Take this pills. Thy will
make the storm even better.
Is it a love affair?
Something like that.
Tell me about it.
I can die for that bitch.
Is it worth for a hooker?
What is it?
Are you mad at me?
I don’t want you to work.
You are a good man, but you
have to learn some realities of life.
I don’t want you to work.
Now you think you’re in love...
...but it is passing thing.
I don’t want you to work.
I will give it to you and we can
even make love like mad dogs.
How long can this go on?
I don’t want you to work!
Its easy to say that but who
will pay the rent, the bills?
Do you think
I want to work?
I don’t want you to work.
You are my honey,
as you wish.
The earth never stops,
but spins and spins.
After taking a last glance at his
brooding belongings, Ali...
...sent the fire to the dead memories.
Despite all the harshness...
...fun and laughter were the meaning
of life in Cholera, but he had to...
...grab Imine and set out for the city
leaving everything behind, on fire.
On those streets where they make
dice out of false gamblers bones...
Salih was looking for some food
hopelessly, finding none.
Baby, are you OK?
Come let's go home.
The monster!
What monster? I'll show you!
What’s up?
Is it your heart?
Get up!
If you eat so much junk,
this is what happens.
Is it only her head or is
anything else missing?
She doesn’t have the goldmine.
The murderer cut her cunt!
Where is it?
It must be somewhere here.
What’s happening?
Are you asking? Shame on you!
Being a real man is not
only being a womanizer.
- You became a hooker's pussy cat!
- So you can't protect the street.
Everybody go home and take a
good nights sleep. From now on...
Ill be in charge, I wont leave you
in the hands of a burn like him.
Stray cat!
How is this one?
Filthy rat!
Disgusting!
Eat more.
What’s up?
Leave that hooker
and be my lover.
I’m out of here!
I would give you the
most luxurious life.
Tina, come here.
Where have you been for 2 days?
I was bored to death.
I was trying to find some money.
Did you?
Of course.
Take this and pay all your debts.
I can even buy a car with the rest.
What will I do now?
What’s wrong?
I’ll find more if necessary.
This is all I have to sell.
Where have you been?
What’s it to you? I was hanging out.
Who were you hanging out with?
What difference does it make?
Whore!
I did it for you, for us.
We had no money.
Shut up!
Don’t hit me. That’s all you know.
Shut up! Come here. Whore!
Stop it!
What did those poor
boys do to you?
Fuck! This is the baker!
They were all sinners!
Siners!
You lost the game!
If the dice were cast differently,
who knows what would be?
Master!
I didn’t tell you I wouldn’t open
the shop, we only moved.
Tina, a customer is waiting.
I told you I’m not working.
If you’re upset, I’ll come by later.
I’m not. I’m not working.
Throw me the keys.
You whore! Take it!
Who are you calling a whore?
Shut up you bastard!
Son of a bitch! Motherfucker!
He exploited me for years.
And he says he loves me! Fuck off!
Its good you cut both of his ears, it
was the rule. You made good name.
But a man should look good too.
Come have a shave every morning.
- Like late Sado.
- I'll ask something, Dad.
What is it?
Don’t ask for rent from Tina.
I talked to my father today.
He wont charge you for the flat.
He will give me the rent from...
...the old flat too.
So we will get by.
Only barely.
What’s that?
Singing in the street again.
Come on, join us.
I’m exhausted. I’ve been in bed
wrestling your buddy.
Then come to the wedding tonight.
They will be a pain in the ass,
father and son together.
Never mind them. Your job is
to get rid of the communists.
We welcome our important guest
Salih and his babe Tina!
A gold bracelet from
Salih for the bride.
Welcome, do you need anything?
Something strong.
Appreciate your beauty and youth.
You will never be this age again.
I don’t waste myself.
I enjoy my time.
You cant do it without money.
Its not a problem, at least now.
Men leave you as soon as
your face gets wrinkles.
I’ve been in love with this bitch for
years, look what she’s done to me.
She not only didn’t give it to me
but ruined my business too.
What will I do?
Shall I cut her? What?
Cut her and then
come to me. OK?
Dear guests. We invite Salih
to the dance floor.
Whore!
The son of a bitch
ruined my youth.
Don’t Salih!
- Are you done Doctor?
- Yes.
What a fucked up life!
What’s this?
But this is Salihs jacket!
I hope its no bad news.
But what is it?
I will be away for
a while. Ill call.
I love you to death.
- Are you Salih's father?
- Yes.
Where is that son of a bitch?
Its your mother who is a bitch.
Why should I give away my son?
Well see whether you will or not.
Id rather die than
give him away.
Hello. Salih brother!
Its me. Give me Dad.
- Your father is not here.
- What do you mean?
The police.
The police? What happened?
They took him away 2 weeks ago.
Its a gorgeous jacket.
Give me the button.
You haven’t been around.
Have you been taking a ride?
Don’t bother. Ill do it.
The key.
I said the key!
Tina, what happened?
Nothing.
What do you mean
nothing? The car?
I gave the car away.
Why is that?
It's not important.
Put this on
God damn it.
Do you have a light, pal?
Sit down! Sit!
Where’s the knife?
What knife?
Where’s the fucking knife?
Where’s the fucking knife?
Where’s the fucking knife?
Where’s the fucking knife?
Bastard!
He was beaten like a dog
but he still hasn’t confessed.
He wont be the same
again anyway.
Just keep him for
a couple of days more.
God, what have I done so bad to
deserve this? Please set Salih free.
Please forgive me.
Please!
God damn it!
God damn it!
You took care of that car
so well. Its never touched.
Its original.
I know. It slides like the wind.
Tina, there is a remedy for
everything. You know...
Salih is at my mercy now,
if you want him back...
He’s out of his skull.
Why is it that always
the evil wins?
That’s life.
You lost this time.
Game over!
