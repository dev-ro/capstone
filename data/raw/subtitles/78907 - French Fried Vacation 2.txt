Pour Janka
Please sir ?
Where's the train to Bourg-Saint-Maurice? It's not written here !
No wonder why, departure is from Saint-Lazare
Listen, i'm not crazy, it's written "Saint-Lazare" on my ticket...
- You think I'm blind or what ?
- I guess so...
Oh yes, I'm blind
Come on Madam, follow me...
Skis parallel...
A last little turn and
we'll kindly stop on the peak.
Madam?... Madam Schmitt?
- Help...
- Oh shit...
Madam?
Madaaaaam!
Aoutch... It's painfull...
Oh la la...
What is this all about ?
Wait Madam Shmitt...
Move from here !
Hou...
Hi Jérôme!
Come over here ... Come to see...
Don't say anything. I don't know her.
It's not my fault.
- I wasn't with her. Don't say anything...
- You're a real master, you...
No kidding man
I'm already in enough trouble...
Hi Mademoiselle
Hi Doctor
Hi Madam!
You see, it's here...
It's the knee.
I can see that!
Well... Doesn't look that bad, right?
So ?
It's here you have pain, isn't it?
Well it's barely nothing,
just a little luxation...
We'll kindly put it back in place
Then it will immediatly get better.
Are you ready Mademoiselle?
Ready, Doctor!
Right... NOW!!!
You didn't feel anything, did you ?
-I did!
-I'm surprised...
So Mademoiselle : Alfaquimotripsine,
very stretch bandage, and aspirin if she has a toothache!
You take the luggage, please?
Hello... Sorry for being slightly late...
I was kept in Paris by a girlfriend...
a bitch... well, a story...
- What's your name?
- Jean-Claude, you?
hum... Dusse, with a "D" like Dusse.
Room 14... I'll take you there.
Oh...This is a pity...
I asked for a room with twin beds...
I may have a girlfriend... possibly...
who would come from Paris
Well it's possible
I'm sorry sir
but we're kind of overbooked lately...
If you tell me exactly the date when 
your lady arrives, maybe we'll find an arrangment.
But I have no idea about this...
Could be tonight... could be tommorow!
Or...
It's not only about her!...
You, for example?
What are your plans for this evening?
Couldn't park better, that one?!
- It's ok, no damage for us.
- Sure?
- Yes, nothing
- Well that's good
- His car is rotten!
- That's it!
- Tanks, thanks!
- I'm sorry, give me a rest... I'm exhausted...
Hello
I am Mr Morin,
I'd like to get the keys of my flat.
-Number...
-205!
205... ah...
There is a little problem sir...
- The former people are still here
- Oh no...
Well listen, this is incredible...
Today's the 16th, it should be available
since yesterday, shouldn't it ?
Bernard, this kind of people upset me.
Well my wife is tired, which stair ?
-WHICH STAIR ?!
-Second sir...
-Come over here you guy !
-I'm tired...
-MOVE ON ! if you are so tired...
Got a visit card ?
Hello, I am Mr Morin
-Yes, What is it about?
-It's about "Sir, you are in my home" !
Oh yes, I understand...
Please forgive us, we were slightly delayed
My wife has been ill, but our luggage is packed
and we'll leave right away
For sure...
My wife was ill in the car too...
You are wrong sir.
You bypassed by 12 hours.
I could have arrived at 00:10
We could even have come at 00:01
if we wanted.
I'm tired...
Excuse us, this is our home, sir!
Sir, calm down.
When we arrived here one week ago,
We got the same problem, and
we didn't make a so big deal of it.
If you want to be a victim, 
it's your business.
I bought this appartmen from the 15th to the 30th
If everybody is half a day late,
What will happen ?
Next year I will ski in July !
Don't get angry Bernard, it's useless.
Let's help them to take out their luggage
Thanks you very much...
Hurry up my darling...
Are you ready my darling?
Oh Bernard, what is this ugly thing ?
Oh yes, there is a little problem...
I guess you didn't read 
the rules of this flat
Let me explain you : we are about 
15 co-owners sharing this flat
The general decoration... 
is supposed to fit to everybody
But this little hook is
the place for the personal touch
Personal, do you understand?
There's no reason why we should bear this poor painting
- I wouldn't like to throw you out...
- Thank you very much sir...
See, It will be my fault soon...
- Life is a jungle
- Don't tell me about it...
Still, it's nice to be home...
Hey, look... They forgot their scrabble
This is great !
Oh no Bernard, you're going too far.
We'll give it back to them...
Hey!! You forgot something!
- Thank you... Thank you very much...
- You're welcome
-Miss, please ?
-euh, yes... Madam !
What do you name "crêpe Gigi"?
Well it's a thin layer of sarazin
cooked on both sides, and covered with a 
thin layer of rose slives... 
- It's delicious.
- I'm sure it is...
I will have a pancake with sugar, and a beer!
Oh no Sir... We don't do this.
You have probably chosen the wrong restaurant.
All our crêpes are described in the menu
You have some pasta ? You have some sugar?
So with the pasta you make a pancake,
and you put a sugar on top!
But what kind of man is this?
Am I dreaming?
Where does this guy think he is?
You prick!
Good, and we don't want to see you again!
- What's up ?
- Another pancake with sugar!
My Pépette, What does my Pépette say?
- What was your emergency?
- Oh nothing bad, a luxation.
- Who was it?
- Oh... hum... sweedish girl.
Poor girl...
-Nice?
-Very nice, wonderfull girl...
Hot, exciting...
And clever on the top!
I saw her like 2 minutes but I could feel some thing happened
Good for you that you had a good moment.
I worked all morning and I'm exhausted!
in case you care about it...
My darling, don't take it that way
Don't touch me!
I don't take it "that way"...
But you are very lucky to meet so interesting people at work
while i'm feeding these pricks, asking me for pancakes with sugar all day
I'm sorry my darling... Come on...
Hello... Coucou!!
It's me... Christiane!
Christiane... the esthetician.
Christiane!!
But this is crazy...
You've changed so much that I couldn't tell!
- Sure?
- Yes, we didn't recognize you, like you saw!
- How are you, my friend?
- Ame I fine?... I am fine!...
I changed, didn't I?
This is love! I'm living a marvelous adventure with an incredible man.
Do you want to sit? To drink something? We have some rests.
No... I came around in a rush, Marius is waiting outside.
Is it the old... the man... there...
who has... hum... a funky hat on his head?
Yes, it's him!
But please be discrete, cause Marius is married
No?? This is terrible...
- So you understand...
- Oh yes... For sure...
I'm very happy to be here!!
- Well, I'm going, but... shhht!
- You can trust us!
And Popeye, what's up with him?
He broke unexpectably with his girlfriend
to go to live in Paris with a girl
When he got there, it was a real disaster:
Family matters... The chick dropped him...
To make it short, he came back after a month...
Let's say it...
...the dick between his legs!
But what he didn't know was that
by then his wife had replaced him !
But does he still work in the shop ?
Yes, well no... He accepted to come back to work 
with them, but now the boss is the other guy !
"He accepded to come back to work"??
You mean she was nice enough to take him back!
-Ho... Gigi...
-Well, to make it short, this guy's a looser...
As you like, but sure thing is : he's really cool
Ho Popeye! Look at who we're talking to you...
So good looking... He's in a good shape!
-We come to give you our money !
-And we are serious clients !
Still growing ?
Well we came with nothing,
so you dress up from the head to the feets !
Fine, let's begin with the coats...
euh...
Ha yes... let me introduce you to my wife, Martine...
euh... and her cousin.
-Hello
-Hello euh... Martine
-Messieurs Dame
I'll explain you...
Waou... it's hudge here!
Is that all yours?
Well actually it's my wife's...
but it's like mine...
I'll explain you...
Well, let's make it easy: you give us
what's best! No need to count every franc!
Flex forward
-Do you touch or not?
-Well I touch with the big toe!
-What about the heel? Can you lift the heel?
-Well yes, I can lift the heel!
No, I mean the heel in the shoe...
Inside...
Inside the shoe? Yes, I can do it easily
Come on Popeye, you have to put her a tread!
Yes, yes... 
Oui, oui... have to put her a tread...
from under, yes...
Tell me Popeye...
The shop closes at 8pm, not 7:45pm.
And do wash the floor,
cause yesterday it was really to dirty.
He's always joking with me Olivier... He loves it...
I'll explain you
Well guys, I guess everything's here!
So Popeye...
You make us a little discount, right ?
-10% discount?
-No problem. I'll ask in case but...
-It would be honest from them, considering all we took...
-Ca serait commerçant avec ce qu'on a pris?
-It would be the least they could do!
NO!
Well then...
Won't be possible...
Because... it's not right with them...
because of money...
Anyway, I'll explain you...
Well that's it: here's the bill!
OK, I'll take a pen...
Do you have an ID?
-Come on, we are his friends...
-Precisely!
-I'll explain you...
-Don't worry, we understood...
Hey, no kidding, i do really need
a double-bed room for this evening
Fine, it will be done
For tomorrow morning, 2 breakfasts in case your Lady
shows up during the night ?
Well yes, yes
OK, Jean-Claude go!
What do you think are the biggest defaults of Jean-Claude?
-He's as straight as a stick!
-He doesn't plant his ski-sticks!
And moreover he's leaning too much backwards...
Carefull!! I gained speed!
-Look, be carefull, you are boring...
-Well these things can happen, no?
So, we all agree to say 
Jean-Claude is a bad skier!
YES!
Well you should know he's the least bad
skier among all of you!
Bernard... for example.
Which is the main default of Bernard?
-He's selfish!
-This is funny, very funny
It has nothing to do with skiing!
What's happening is that you ski on one leg only
Looks like you had an accident!
Did you break your leg, or whatever?
No...?
So what you will do...
Take off one of your skis
and you will see that your two legs are useful!
Go ahead, take of one of your skis !
It's completly stupid, I'll fall down
I just want you to feel...
You will see, I'll manage to do it!
Be carefull...
-Did you feel it?
-Yes, I understood well, I understood well!
About you Nathalie, you're leaning completly backwards.
I feel like you don't want to ski
That's not it.
It's my shoes, they are too big.
Look.
It's totally tightened.
Oh, i see yes... yes...
You should try about 10 velkost smaller 
You'll come by to the ski shop
-I'll never make it
-Of course you will:
Just let it pull you and don't sit on it. That's all.
Really? So I shouldn't sit?
No, no, Noooo!!
Let the pole ("zdr") go now!
Let the pole go!!
Out of my way!
Be carefull you, somebody's trying to take your place!
Hey slowly... we are all civilised people.
Bernard, I can't do anything with these shoes.
It's too big!
-Well you should tight up the hooks!
-But It cannot be more tight...
Well look at me and do exactly what i do
Go ahead!
Hop.
Move... Move!
Be careful, you're gonna make everybody fall!
Are you fine?
No! My shoes are too big.
We should have filled it with newspaper...
You're boring...
You could have guessed it before!
After the post over there, let the pole go!
I can't... I'm stuck on this stuff!
But try move out, do something!
Well bravo... very handy 
Oh shit.
-Bernard! I'm here!
-I'm coming
I'm sorry!
Will you have dinner with us this evening?
Non I can't, I have a meeting.
With who?
The boss of the hotel
I cannot drop her.
She insisted so much...
And additionaly, I can feel that... euh... tonight...
I'll make it with her!
-Won't you help me?
-No, not now, no...
Do you know you bluff me Jean-Claude?
You've been here since two days...
and you are already about to get a girl!
Look Bernard...
I think you and I have similar problems:
The point is that we cannot really count on our
physical appearance.
Especially you.
So if I can give you an advice:
Forget that you don't have a chance, just go for it!
Who knows, maybe it will work out of a missunderstanding!
Well I'll take the seat-lift, I have to change my cloth
Hey, but hurry up, cause the seat-lit will close!
HEY YOU THERE!
OOHHH! Don't you dare!
Doesn't he hear when we speak to him?
These are my skis!
It's mine...
I don't think so,
my name's written on it: Bernard Morin!
Is your name Bernard Morin?
Excuse me, I have the same!
-Here they are, look...
-Where?
Ha yeah yeah... It's the same,
exept yours are old!
So you take the new and let the old!
Thinking about it, you're right: not seen, not taken.
If I were you, I'd do the same!
Hooo, are you crazy?
Everybody can make mistakes!
So I can make mistakes too.
Look, I'm making a mistake now!
But this guy is crazy?!
Careful!! My ski!!
Argh shit...
Well it won't fall downer...
Me, what I see, it's that when one doesn't know how to ski, 
he should stay home!
But it's not my fault...
It's not me who launched it!
-Not your falt? Not your fault!! Come on...
-No but I mistook my skis with others up there...
-Well. Who does this ski belong to?
-It's mine, but...
-Well, so!
And it went this close to my mother!
-Are you fine mum?
-Come on she has nothing... she has nothing...
-Are you fine mum?
I hope this won't last for long.
I'll be late!
-Cricri, you will end up by getting cold
-For once that I have fun, let me alone!
-Christiane, it's enough:we go home!
-Listen, I'm coming...
Stop ordering, this is incredible!
That's fine, that's fine my big girl.
-I really do like this sport!
-You're making real progress, hey?
-Wait 5 more minutes, I'll go and come back once more
-Listen...
-Did you see how much progress I make?
-Oh yeah, oh yeah... Very well...
10km more and we go home!
Hey Popeye, you're a real professional to find fitting shoes!
Yes,yes... you're nice, these are my clients
This one, I can't believe it.
Sometimes his humor is boring!
Ok, try these...
Hey Popeye, do you think we'd be able to do that?
A descent from helicopter?
Oh, whenever you want!
Do you want me to organise that for you?
-Are we good enough?
-No problem...
-I'd give it a go!
Popeye!
Come over here...
30'000 are missing.
Ha ok...
Now when I borrow 30K, it's a thief!
Ah, well thanks! Thanks Martine!
Well if it's like this, I prefer to put it 
back right now. It's not hard.
Yes I would prefer...
I don't have it on me.
5 minutes! Do you have 5 minutes?
So my friends, how is it going?
Bon les amis alors? Où est-ce qu'on en est?
-Is this better?
-Yes it's better. But not ok...
-Come on, you have to tight it...
-Ho yes...
Tell me, you wouldn't have 300 francs to lend me?
It would help me...
Come on! You see, it's because you have to tight your shoe
Thanks
Come on we'll tight that! Nicely...
-You see, you have two different levels to tight it
-You didn't tight it!
Hook after hook...
Ha, this is getting better...
And the last one
Wait don't move...
... it's a tough one!
What's happening to you?
-Is it too tight?
-We should take it off...
We would need a screwdiver ("skrutkovac"),
or something to make a lever ("paka"), see
-Popeye, let me prevent you: If you damage it, you pay!
-Yes, yes... it's nothing, it's fine...
But you are so stupid, you are so stupid!!
-She'll get used...
-Well i'd prefer it, cause hum... if not we'll have to break the shoes
You'll keep it on your feet.
And slowly, your ankles will get smaller...
And it will be easier to take it off!
Nathalie? You come to sleep?
I'm exhausted...
I'm exhausted... hhaa!
I'll sleep like a baby
When will I see you again?... hum....
Wonderful country... hum...
Where those who love each other... hum...
live hum... together!
When will I see you again?... hum....
Wonderful country... hum...
Where those who love each other... hum...

Hello!
Ha... Hello.
Hey, I hope you didn't wait for me yesterday?
Cause I was busy till 3 in the morning
Ha no no. I didn't go to ski finaly.
Your two breakfasts...
Your lady didn't arrive yet
Hein?
Hum no, but it's only a matter of time.
Argh shit!
Ah shit, it's frozen
Only one way...
Excuse me but you are urinating on my car.
-Sorry?
-You are urinating on my car!
Ha sorry...
Cause I have the same over there, so...
-Ha yes...
-It's the same color and everything...
-Yes yes...
I'm sorry
Let me finish?!
Good car, hey?
Please Mademoiselle,
I would have liked to take a private lesson with... hum...
Anne Laurencin
For one or two hours?
Ho... hum...
For the whole day!
Aouch!! You did Really hurt me right now!
You pulled up my eye...
-Show me?
-Holy cow, look at that
-But there's nothing?
-Cause it's a joke, that's the reason!
This is funny...
Will you come skiing with me?
Nope, I have a private course with Anne Laurencin
-Hey, you didn't choose the ugliest one
-Pretty, pretty...
-Well then have a nice skiing!
-Yes, if i manage to loosen up...
Mister Dusse?
You took an appointment with my collegue Number 12
She's ailing, she cannot come.
I stand in for her
Ha...
Well i hope it's not too serious, is it ?
You did right by taking a full day!
It's the best way to improve.
We'll ride up with the chair lift, and up there we'll have a glass of hot wine, ok ?
OUCH! Do look out!
Come on, our gimmick is hardly familiar
Well you see man, you don't have the knack to do it
-OUCH!
-I feel like you Do have the knack now!
Nice!
Ha shit...
Take the dog
Shit, shit, shit, an emergency!
You take the dog up to GiGi,
Please tell her it's an emergency,
else she'll start to imagine anything!
Let her imagine...
They love that.
Do what I say, let it go...
I don't want to sadden
-So what's this emergency about Miss?
-It's the Guillains. It's quite... special.
-Hello!
-Hello Doctor...
-What are we here for?
What's that?
What is THAT!??
-It's Copain(buddy).
-How that Copain?? Are you dissing me?!
Yes Copain, it's his name...
We name him Copain... like pigs (french idiom:as thick as thieves).
But what did you come here?
I do NOT do animals !
But you were soooo nice last time Doctor
But last time I was just helping out!
I am not a veterinary.
Try to understand that, Mister Guillain
Doctor, he's anemic.
He doesn't eat...
He's anemic?
Just EAT him!
I cannot help you. Eat him!
Move miss, I want this mess out!
Move out! And let them eat there pig!
You heard me:
EAT IT!
Coucou Janka
Squat... Sting with your stick... Extension!
Squat... Sting with your stick...... Extension!
Squat... Sting with your stick...... Extension!
I had enough, let's stop.
Do you want to go and have a glass of hot wine?
Yeah...
I think i'm gonna vomit.
Come on, this is unbelievable...
Pissing off people zoning out on the track!
This is not right Mister Dusse!
It's the 30th time I tell it to you.
-Your "Sting with the stick" is really bad!
-Yes,yes,yes...
Keep this right in your mind!
Yes I'm aware of that!
It's been 30 times, I know it!
Hey! Hey wait!
Can we ascend together?
I'm with the old and he's driving me crazy now
Really? Well as you like!
-Your Ski Pass please
-Yeah, well it's here, wait...
Mister Dusse...
You let your SkiPass fall!
I'm the one who gathered it.
A day will come, when you will forget your head!
Yes I know... I know...
Mister Dusse, as we have 20 minutes to ascend,
we'll take advantage from this time to make a little course about "stinging the stick"
And as soon as we arrive, to reward you, we'll go for a glass of hot wine!
Mister Dusse, your problem is "stinging the stick"...
..."Stinging the stick" is really wrong...
..."Stinging the stick"...
I'm gonna sting the stick into you!
Mister Dusse?
Are you ok?
It's nothing... The hot wine...
It's gonna be ok... It's gonna be ok...
Are you ready?
Just a second...
Ha Mister Camus!
How are you?
Can I speak to you for a sec, please?
Yes, yes... a little minute hum...
Ready?
Go!
So I bring you back your stuff.
It's from my wife.
Considering the fact that I came home earlier than expected
I obstructs our way, see?
Ha Mister Camus,
I think there is a misunderstanding
I wouldn't like you to imagine that your wife
housed me other than in good faith
Ha no... Of course...
And as there is only one bed in the house,
you had to sleep on the carpet, inevitably
Besides it's very very hard...
but it still helped me out.
I thank you very much, Mrs Camus, 
as well as yourself.
So about the lessons...
I don't pay anything?
I guess she didn't ski much during my absence, did she?
-Not even half of it?
-No!
-Cause she did ski a bit...
-Yes... but no.
And I was counting on that as well...
-So it's for me...
-Yes! That's it. I'll go now...
I don't need to throw a punch at you, do I?
I guess it's not worth it, is it?
No... really not worth it...
Bye, Mister hum... Camus.
So, what's my time?
Shit, I forgot to stop the stopwatch...
-Hum... 45... 45... 8
-45.8
Holy cow!
5 seconds less on the same run as yesterday!
And I didn't push it hard, I went quiet!
It's because of my skis: these skis were second in Cran-Montana!
Ha, I'll pulverize them tomorrow for the criterium
Ha, I have such a punch men, such a punch!
Waouw!
Well that's it, it's ok... She's here
-Are you sure the cousin is not here?
-Yeah, yeah, you know, this fuckhead left 2 days ago
It's ok, It's ok...
Maybe I'm wrong, but I can tell you that I really
feel like it's getting better with Martine
Do you think she wiped the slate clean? (=forgave you)
Of course, some signs are obvious
See, it's been a week, she doesn't speak to me anymore... at all!
Think this is a good sign?
Oh yes, I know her. She's waiting for me to do the first step
She's here, telling to herself... hum...
I went too far...
He's an incredible man... hum...
And meanwhile, she's stuck
by the other cousin, you know...
Frankly Popeye...
Don't you feel like you are the only one
who wants to fix this?
Yeah maybe, yeah...
But anyway it's enough.
I cannot live without her anymore
And I DID change enormously.
You noticed it, didn't you?
Yes,yes... for sure
So my guess is that it should be ok!
The most important is that you feel it
Anyway I really wish it to you Popeye, from all my heart,
cause you're really a good person
Yeah I know...
And don't forget your suitcase
... Ha yeah... the suitcase ...
Anyway I don't know where to sleep tonight
I'm not gonna propose you to sleep at home.
You know Gigi...
Poor old chap...
Hi Martine.
I don't disturb you, do I?
Cause here it is,
I would like to ask you a small favour...
I don't have a place for tonight...
So I was thinking that... well...
Maybe I could come sleep here
Cause I know you are alone...
I thought you wouldn't mind, would you?
Well... Come in.
Thanks... It's really great from you...
I'm thinking that we nearly didn't rejoin up
Finaly, it's thanks to the husband of the woman from Bordeaux.
I fucked her during 2 months for 400 francs each day
and this fuckhead came back without warning.
That's why I don't have a place to sleep.
Else I would never have come back !
But what's wrong with you?
Did I say a dogshit, or what?
Be careful! Be careful!
Don't take it like that, please!
Ha shit...
Yes I'm coming!
Coming... Just a sec...
Coming...
That's it!
Ha... You...
Hi Jean-Claude.
I don't disturb you, you're alone now?
Hum yes, at least for now...
I need you to help me out
Could I stay at your place this evening?
Cause I don't have a place to sleep...
and if I have to sleep outside, with this cold i'm gonna peg out
That's to say it doesn't suit me cause..
I thought i would eventualy "conclude" with the receptionist.
Ha really Jean-Claude you are very cool,
thank's a lot.
Ha no, light... shit...
Ho but I see your Lady arrived.
No, no, hum...
It's just a friend, to help out.
-Nothing wrong about it Mister
-Course not, nothing wrong, nothing wrong!
(Next minute, in 30 minutes, if you want...
... OK after the 30 of us go)
I'm gonna pulverize them...
I did 45'8 yesterday at the training...
(At the start: Number 34, Dr Jérôme Tarrère, France)
Ha I felt great on that one
(Time of number 34, Dr Jérôme Tarrère: 67'22)
What??!
But this is great Jérôme,
You're rank is about 40th!
-How much did he just say?
-67'22 he said
No way, there must be a mistake?!
It's 20 seconds more than yesterday, on the same run.
Same run, right?
Don't get pissed off Jérôme...
Besides I think you snagged a door
I didn't snag, I ripped!
Don't speak about what you don't know!
God this girl is dumb!
Fine, I'm dumb... very fine...
This is unbelievable, 20 seconds more than yesterday.
It's almost twice as much!
And I went like crazy!
Maybe yesterday there was a mistake in the timing?
That's it... There's a mistake in the timing.
Come on... Come with me, we go to see the judges!
But no... Jérôme... no!
Yesterday, it was yesterday...
Do you think I'm a fool?
How do you do your timings?
20 seconds more than yesterday on the same run!
Think I will buy your game?!
At ease!!
And don't count on me next year for the contest
This is finished! Finished!
Hey Jérôme...
You know the other day, maybe we made a mistake...
Maybe we didn't read the stopwatch?
Well yes, who knows, mabye you did 54'
Don't try to convince me...
Since 10 years that the criterium is organized
they never let a generalist win.
Never,never,never!
Psychiatrists, urologists, gynaecologists... 
Loads of them...
But generalists... Never!
I should have been an ophtalmologist...
No, listen...
Well, where is Gigi, hey?
And the van?
They left together
Shit, shit, shit!
-Hey, what are you doing?
-See, now I take this pullover
I fold it, place it in my suitcase...
I close my suitcase...
And I go to have some holidays!
Stop your bullshit Gigi, what's wrong with you?
Do you realize what you told me in front of everybody?
Ha, this is the reason?
I'm sorry... It's not that bad, is it?
The important thing is my result, and the fact they want to mark down generalists, right?
Ho, ok...
It's not bad to treat me off dumb in front of everybody?
But you know what's important.
You always know what's important.
Well guess what, I'm gonna
do something which is not important:
I'll take some holidays.
Alone, without you.
Who pisses me off, pisses me off, and shit!
Calm down Gigi, calm down!
At this time you are tired, so you're gonna go up,
take two pills and have a rest
And we'll discuss about all that when you will be 
calmer and no longer hysterical.
-OK?
-OK. In 15 days. If I come back.
Gigi, shit!
Can't you understand that I put a lot on this run?
It's really breathtaking to do 20 seconds more than at the training
What is breathtaking is that you can't even
realize that your friend may have made a mistake when he timed you...
Well this, it goes way over your head, hey?!
You're not able to do 35 seconds at the slalom.
You're bad... you're bad.
Well I think we have nothing else to say to each other?
Well bye, and have nice holidays!
The door, fuck!
I fuck you!
He annoys me...
-Excuse me I'm really dumb...
-Yes
-Shit, the dog!
-Pépette... Pépette answer me my darling...
I was calling you to know if Annie
came by at 7:30?
Hey Jérôme. This flour smells strange, doesn't it?
Yet...
Bravo, This is clever...
Yes? And do you know why she didn't do it?
Oh, ok...
-And Jean-Claude?
-Wait a second!
Look, if she comes back, tell her to call me, no matter what.
I count on you.
Thanks Madam.
Sorry?
Ho, it's Sir, sorry.
Bye Sir.
So how many will it be?
Well two, still two!
Theoritically she should be on her way now.
Who's Annie?
-Is she the receptionist from the hotel?
-Oh no, this is an old story.
No, Annie is a girl I overthrown skiing.
She got hurt, so we immediatly got friendly.
Ladies, Gentlemen,good evening!
That's it, we have the helicopter for tomorrow.
I found you a substitute Jean-Claude.
Still not coming?
No I can't, I'm on something,
and I have good chances to "conclude"...
So, you will see, he's a very nice man,
and besides, he works on TV.
Hi, it's us...
Let me introduce you to Marius, my friend.
-Good evening
-Good evening...
-I didn't come with empty hands!
-Ho, this is nice, Bordeaux...
-Excuse me, it's for me...
-Yes, because Marius can't digest white wine.
It's barmy, hey?...
Well... Hum... You can give me your coats,
please come and sit down.
Tell me?
Christiane told us you work in hair arrangement.
Yes and no... Actualy...
I was in wigs, artificials, forelocks
But do you sell many of them? Cause it seems quite new to wear these... these...
Not at all... You can't imagine how many famous people wear wigs.
And is there many bald women?
Many!
Marilyn Monroe...
-Come on!
-Marilyn Monroe!
Like that, like an egg...
This is sausages!
Like an egg!
She got this from her mother, inherited.
Ask to Mister
Are you the one who made the wigs for Marilyn?
Ha no, no...
It's very good.
It's famous in our profession.
However I did work for the Général de Gaulle.
He wanted to change his personality,
I made him a very nice ginger-goatee
A what?
A ginger-goatee.
A goatee, ginger!
He wanted to change his personality,
but finaly I think he never used it.
Yes, we would remember it, inevitably...
-Who else could i tell them about?
-I don't know, there's so many of them...
Farouk?
Will you tell them the joke?
-You know I never manage to tell it till the end
-Come on, it's a crazy one...
Oh, right, crazy...
He was meeting me 10 times a day,
and each time he saw me,
Marius Francesquini... Do you know what is
the highest pitch for a wig-maker?
Then inevitably I was answering:
"Well no, I don't know...?"
Lack of brass...
See, I can't do it...
Lack of brass neck!
He was making some gestures,
cause he was afraid I wouldn't understand!
What happened to you my darling?
Everytime there's a fondue, I do that.
You'll see, it's so fun!
Are you putting your dental floss?
-Excuse me, but i'm really hot
-Well yes, you were all red...
And you don't know where she could be?
Well forget about it, bye Sir.
Sorry?
Ho... By Madam, excuse me!
Well so, will your girl come or not?
Yes, just continue, it will make her come
First one who drops his bread in the
fondue gets a punishment...
-But isn't it thick?
-We'll have to pick out the spools!
Ho no, that's it, there's real thread in it!
Who put thread in it, it's inedible!
If it's a joke, it's not funny!
Thanks Bernard, it's a dickhead joke!
But I didn't do anything...
So it's you Jérôme,
you were with him in the kitchen
I promiss you it's not me. I love fondue,
I'd never do such a dickhead joke!
Well men listen, you could denounce yourself.
In this case it could be anybody. Could even be Marius!
-Excuse them
-It's not that bad...
Do you think so?!
I think it's completly dumb
Really, some jokes are funny,
but this one spoils up the food.
-Relly Bernard it's not funny.
-But let me go, it's not me, shit...
Calm down Bernard
There is blueberry pie and salad.
Who wants to drink something?
-Anybody wants some of my Bordeaux?
-No thanks, we're fine...
Are you sure she didn't show up?
Well then I guess something cropped up.
Good evening... Hum... Ladies and Gentlemen
... since the begining of this season,
what did we do... 43 fractures? Not more.
It's closed Sir!
Ho no! It's Seldman,
the substitute of Jean-Claude for the helicopter.
Get around!
You'll see he's lovely.
(Get around, get around, ...)
Come in Gilbert, come in! Good evening.
Let me introduce you to Gilbert, the one
who will replace Jean-Claude for the helicopter
Sit down Gilbert
-I see I know some of you: good evening doctor.
-Good evening
-Do you want a piece of pie?
-Yes, with pleasure
Well there's no more of it. Sad, hey?
I don't want to be tactless,
but your face seems familiar...?
-No wonder why, I'm Gilbert Seldman
-Mister is a TV star.
Really? Which show?
I do the weather forecast during the news.
I don't want to brag, but I do rain and sunshine on TV.
Haaa, haa, did you understand this one...?
Wait for me! Finaly I'm free!!
Hey... this sweeps out the lungs, right?
This will make you good,
with all the junk you breath during the whole year.
-How high are we now? Cause it's hard to breath...
-Aproximately 3800m
See, it's the station we see downthere.
It's low, hey?
Popeye... Is this the Mont-Blanc?
Pfff... No! This is the Mont-Rose.
And then, hum...
See, this is the Dent du Guignol
And there, behind, the Coulée du Grand Bronze,
but hum... we can't see it.
Now we feel very small...
(anyway you're not very tall...)
I feel like the weather's gonna be nice.
Yeah, thanks...
-Well... Let's go to la Coulée du Grand Bronze
-Will we eat there? 
-Yeah, picnic!
-Ha, such a landscape my children, this is wonderful!
-And with this white snow it looks so mint...
-Really clean
-When we think about what Riviera became...
Now the sea is disgusting!
It's a realy garbage dump, 
you cannot put your bottom down without sitting on a can.
Here, at least, when we come it's clean!
The problem is when we leave.
Course not! Snow covers everything,
so it remains immaculate!
-And in summer, when it melts, how do you do?
-Well in summer, you don't come here, you go to the sea!
-Yeah, but sea is icky
-...
Ho? Do you guys follow?
-Is it still far?
-No, it's just there, look!
Tell me, is there some people?
There is smoke!
Yeah, a haven is opened to everybody!
Anyway, it could be nice people there.
Once there was a squad of policemen...
They sang promiscuous songs till 3' am
We did have fun!
-Good point, my brother is a policeman.
-Yeah...?
Bood evening!
(Buenacera...)
-Where do we sleep Popeye?
-Well normaly, in the room next door.
Marcello Buidi di Milano,
buenacera, buenacera...
Well they took the room next door,
so we can sleep here.
Shit, they took the best room!
Tell me... Did you see how many they are?
They should sleep here!
Well Jérôme, will you tell them something?
Well tell them...
You speak italian so well!
Anyway they should understand themselves that they bother.
Hum... Bonjourno
-What's your name?
-Fernanda
Ha Fernanda, It's Fernande in french.
It's a very nice name.
Besides there is a song about this name.
It's like: "When I think of Fernande, talala, la la la..."
(famous french song of Georges Brassens, 
the following should be "i have an erection")
"When I think of Félicie..."
(should be "i have an erection too")
"When I think of Fernande, I have an erection, I have an erection"
-Oh yes... She knew the song...
-She likes Brassens...
Hum, is this nice man who's cooking water your husband?
-No, no, a friend:Nico...
-Ha... Nico!
-And the other dickhead in the next room?
-Tutti amici (all friends - italian)
-Ahhh....
-Tutti amici
É bonardo...
If I may prepare you spaghettis al italiena, per tutti.
-Ho, good idea...
-Spaghettis "el pesto"
Hum please, "el pesto",
is it because it stinks?
Come on!
Come, I have something to tell you!
The italian is free, I can feel it's for me,
so be nice, let her alone.
In these things, no friendship!
Yeah, well it's obnoxious for the others
-Well I go to get some wood. Will you help me?
-Yes, I'm gonna give you a hand!
Yeah, we're gonna give you a hand
Leave us alone, leave us, you're boring!
Here you are Jean-Claude, you can bring that.
Fernada and I, we'll bring the rest.
-Ho, this mouse is so heavy
-No, these are "pieces of wood", and this is "mouse"...
-Hey, this is ingenious!
-Let it go, she's crazy. She doesn't know what she wants.
Come on, I was this close to "conclude".
You spoilt everything.
-I don't know what stops me from battling it out!
-Fear, no?
Yeah, probably.
Come on, let's get in!
This is where we are, right?
This is the border?
Yeah, that's it
It's funny cause it goes exactly across the cottage
-Ho?
-This is funny.
And now, am I in Italy or in France?
Well now you're in Italy
And we're in France!
I'm worried, I can't go to sleep: I don't have my passport!
Finaly it's a real luck that I came alone
cause I was supposed to come with a girl, but...
Whatever can be said, in couple, you meet less people, don't you think?
Time to go to sleep, buena note!
Buena note...
-Buena note tutti!
-Good evening!
'scusat... I begin to feel tired.
Buena note
Waou Jean-Claude, we are fucked, she's with him!
Thank you, I understood...
There are wonderful hikes to do in this region.
All along the border there is one, which is about 10 kms long, 5 to 6 hours of descent.
-Ha, this is beautiful...
-I'll take you there one day if you want.
You now, about borders there are even more incredible stories
Last year I visited the house of the custom officer Rousseau
Ho yes, this is an astonishing story
This house is crossed by a border.
-Yeah, cut in two parts then.
-Yes...
So they built a wall which signals the border.
The house is cut in two parts, very hard to visit.
Because of the wall yes...
Yes... this is the highest pitch for a custom officer!
-Yeah, the same thing happened to Odette, your mother.
-Ho yeah... yeah...
Imagine that: when she went to Swizerland,she went accross the customs...
-Yes...
-And she had a big block of chocolate of 500g
And they searched her everywhere, everywhere, everywhere!
For 500 grams...
Well anyway, there are some nice hikes around here...
Hum... Do you have a cigaret please?
Gracié!
I begin to feel tired...
Buena note.
-Yeah... Buena note... 
-Good evening...
Well i'm gonna go for a walk!
This is impossible, they must be paying her!
Maybe we need to pick a number?
Ho, but she's hot!
-She's a real monster you mean!
-I want to vomit...
Come on, don't push it to hard!
E possible your friend doesn't look by the window, per favoré?
Gracié mille!
I was outside watching the stars and inopportunely somebody opened the shutter
and it kicked me in the face...
I'm gonna fuck her!
I'm gonna fuck her!
Excuzi, excuzi!
Come on, it's easy to say "excuzi"!
-Is this place notorious?
-Not at all!
I can swear you that last time with the policemen it was really not the same.
That said, there were these officers...
I can tell, with my brother it wasn't the same game!
Bernard, they are snoring now...
But this is not possible!
These "macaronis" can't do anything in silence!
-ENOUGH!! ENOUGH!!
-He? Excuzi...
Ha, congratulations Bernard!
They were sleeping and now they doing it again!
-They're driving me crazy!
-Throw them a bucket of water or whatever!
You're jealous men...
These italians are wicked good!
This is not possible, they're gonna do it all night,
we would like to sleep!
This is enough!
Some people would like to sleep!
ENOUGH! ENOUGH!!
Arrivederchi, arrivederchi!
Ha, this is not human... these bastards... they exhausted me!
-Move your ass, Nathalie!
-What do I do with the trash?
Just swing it under the beds, we don't care about that!
But hurry up... We have to go down.
Hey, slowly, we are not beefs!
-Put it straight, you're gonna crease everything
-Thanks...
Careful fingers...
Don't get into that mood.
You knew it: I have to go
I know Marius, but I can't control myself
I'm very possessive, you'll have to get used to that
I'm making an incredible effort not to collapse
But what would it change?
When you have to go... you have to go!
And you're not staying alone here, you have your friends.
Don't forget, you're having dinner together this evening. It will be nice.
-They are nice, aren't they?
-I like them, but till a measured portion...
I don't know what to tell the, i feel so different
But you are different! Believe me, oh la la!
It's the reason why we are together, isn't it?
Surely...
Here is a little present for you. 
By this way I'll still be a little with you this evening.
What is it?
A plastic oyster. When you take it, it makes "pouet-pouet"
You'll always make me laugh...
Beware to the departure!
-You'll put your seatbelt
-Of course!
-Do you want me to push you?
-Ho yes, I'd like that...
-Are you pushing, my Cricri?
-But turn... Turn!
-Will you phone me when you arrive?
-I'll try, but push... push!
-Did you hurt yourself?
-No it's nothing, you can go peacefully.
I don't stop, i'm launched
I'll write to you!
Be careful my honey!
So, do you follow?
Slowly, we're not used...
Come on let's go...
I'm tired...
Tell me Popeye?
Are you sure this is the right way?
Cause I don't recognize this place!
Look buddy, if you're afraid you shouldn't go out of tracks!
I don't say that for me. We're not alone!
Hey.... Go!
I'm exhausted...
Come on... Put yourself sideways...
But I caaaan't
Let yourself go...
Cause the snow is too limp for me!
You already did it!
It's too hard...
Come... It's a piece of cake...
I go, but i'm afraid...
It's so fast...
In snowdlow! (missprounounced, should be snowplow)
It's so fast... It's so fast...
It's TOO FAST!
-Get off the ground lazybones!
-Stop bullshiting, maybe she's injured?
-Where do you have pain?
-Shoulder!
Ok Nathalie, stop this comedy...
Don't you see it's painful?!
-Is it very painful?
-Yes.
Yes, well the head of the bone came out of its lodging.
I'm gonna put it back in place, and you'll be better immediatly after!
And... Will it be painful?
No.
It's very painful.
My brother got the same. He did suffer!
-Gigi!
-Yes?
-Ho excuse me... Excuse me
-When I'll put her arm back in its lodging
-Yes?
-I'll make you a sign
-Yes
-At that moment, don't hesitate, kick her. Dryly.
To disturb her attention from pain
-Me?
-Yes. Did you understand?
You saw me doing it with the nurse?
-Don't worry, you can do it.
-Well ok
It will be fine
And be careful to her arm!
It will be a real peace of cake Nathalie...
-Are you crazy, I didn't tell you anything!
-You told me to kick!!
But I told you to kick when i'll give you the signal!
-But I didn't hear anything...
-I didn't say anything! I didn't do the signal!
-Would you be able to do it?
-I understood, I understood...
Ok, Look at me, I'll give you a signal.
-Is it finished?
-No, it will be right now...
-It's not over???
Get ready Bernard.
It will take 2 seconds!
Is it my turn now?
But no, but no!
Are you a monster? You are a monster!
It's for you not to suffer...
I'm on edge, on edge...
-Are you ok Nathalie, do you follow?
-Leave me alone, you!
Popeye, you'll print us this hike...
Wake up Nathalie!
Don't you see we are exhausted?!
Everybody's tired.
In a quarter of hour we'll be in the station...
A quarter, that's a load of rubish...
It's been two hours that it's a quarter!
And we don't even have any fixed point...
-This is enough!
-But Popeye, wait for us!
For him it's easy, it's a descent...
We're taking a roundabout way, just because it's BEAUTIFUL!
Come on, what is that?
Nothing, happens often at this time of the year...
Here we're safe, we can stop by for 5 minuters
Are you kidding, safe...
Popeye, we're not gonna keep going blindly!
This place doesn't ring a bell for me. So try to remember!
-Have you ever been here?
-It was summer, try to understand...
There were cows all around
-It was really different...
-But try to remember!
Last time you came, did you go on the right or on the left of the stump?
Well that's the point!
I already mistook twice:
Should go to the left and I had been on the right
Or the contrary.
I don't know...
Well, so did you find the way?
-Just a minute! We're evaluating the situation...
-You're lying Jérôme
You're lying. You have no idea of where we are.
We are completly lost. We're all gona die frozen
And me I'll never see Pépette again and you will be happy, happy!
Gigi calm down!
Calm down... Calm down!
Stop figthing.
It's all my fault
But we don't give a damn that it's our fault!!!
You shouldn't have taken us here!
We're in the shit because of you
And the only thing you think of doing is complaining on your fate!
You have no courage, you are just good to be the dogsboy of your wife!
We are in shit. Gigi told it to us:
we're all gonna die here
We are in this shit because of you, because you are a dumbass.
And you are cuckold and you ask for more!
-Bernard?
-What?
-Excuse us Popeye.
-No but it's ok...
Anyway it's all true
Let's forget about all that. Now that we rooted out the devil...
It will get better, we're gonna rebuild things on better bases.
We're gonna find a way out by a way or another.
It's nice Jean-Claude...
You're the only one who doesn't yell at me.
Bastard, I'll kill you!!!
Ho!! We are safe and sound...
I can see the CHRIST!!
Do you know about this repository?
Well yes, it's Notre Dame of the Touffe
-So where are we?
-Well in the Massif of the Touffe!
-And by which way should we ski down??
-But I have no idea!
I never set a foot here!
I don't care. You go for rescue.
I won't move anymore!
I'm exhausted, my shoulder is painful.
Go and get the helicopter, then come back.
-Well Popeye, what do we do now?
-I'll go for the helicopter
No way. If you fail, nobody will ever know where we are.
-Yeah...
-So we'll go with you and the women will wait for us
Well, I wouldn't like to delay you...
And it's better if a man stays with the women...
In case they would have a malaise though...
Can I stay too?
No, no... It's full now!
Gilbert... stop!
Skis rankled, skis rankled!
You're too slow! You're too slow!
You have to go back up by foot.
You're delaying us.
No way, considering all I descended, I continue!
NO! We'll be late for the helicopter.
Take off your shoes and ride up by foot.
-Come on... you delay us, sincerely.
-Ha, nice, the hike!
Considering the price it costs, thanks...
-yeah yeah just go...
-You're delaying us... Even I descend faster!
-Come on kids, it's hard but we should go.
-We're coming right now...
Are you ok?
Keep the pulse: it will be night in an hour!
Wait for me, i'm loosing my cap!
If you were jammed on a desert island with a guy like me...
...How long would you hang on?
Well it depends on what we would have to survive
But it's not what I meant!
I meant, hum...
human rapports!
Like when you are in an exiguous place, like...
an elevator for example?
Hey, didn't I tell you?
Once I got stuck in an elevator.
With a man i absolutely didn't know...
It's incredible, hey...?
These ideas come so fast!
Yes, well that's it.
We are in the elevator, so there are necessarily ideas coming
-But it's normal!
-Yes, it's normal.
But there's a hudge gap between these ideas and reality...
We're not animals...
Of course we're not animals.
It's not the point, but...
Imagine... It's just an assumption, hey?!
Imagine rescue doesn't show up?
Considering the fact that, that hum...
We all have these ideas beacause we are in the elevator...
It would be a pity to die without enjoying 
the pleasure of our senses a last time
Ha but be careful Jean-Claude...
The difference is that the man in the elevator...
he was attracted to him!
You don't control these things...
You're right...
Hey? Where are you going?
I'll walk straight ahead...
In the best case I'll get to the station
Otherwise i'll just get mashed on a rock...
It won't be a big loss for anybody...
Bye girls...
Wait Jean-Claude...
Don't be a fathead!
Don't take everything at the first degree...
Does it mean that possibly...
If you were really hopeless...
We might consider to "conclude"?
Yes.
Well only if there really no more hope.
Yes.
Well then we'll see.
I don't know why, but I feel like they won't show up.
Well in 10 minutes i'll consider us like definitely lost!
Han! Listen!
Sounds like the breathing of an animal
A beast?
I'm afraid...
-There's a beast!
-I'm afraid!
It's him!!
Ho it's you... 
Ho Gilbert... Gigi and I are really happy to see you.
You can't imagine...
Cause you consider this like rescue?
Oh YES!
Look Popeye...
You tell us: we go straight ahead and we'll be there...
It's what you told us, right?
Yeah but I probably made another mistake...
The point is... Instead of going back up by food in the snow
We'll be faster if we climb here!
I think the station is just behind, see...
Ha yeah yeah..
Climb up on that?
You do it.
Me I don't
-You'll pay me that!
-Come on dudes, climb is easy
Hey! It's not written "alpinist", ok?
Come on go, go, go!
Stop discussing, you're loosing your oxygen!
But climb up...
Popeye, there's no more grip!
Calm down Bernard!
But I am CALM!
There's no grip, no grip!
Calm down Bernard, calm down!
-I will help me, lean on me...
-But the snow is limp!
If it was hard, you would slide down!
So don't complain!
-Ha, but you are loosers, hey...
-Shut up, you...
-SHUT UP!!!
Come on, lean on me
AAAHH what's happening?
We are in the void, you have to pull us up now
Pull Popeye! PULL!
I can't, you are too heavy
But what are you doing Popeye?!
Pitch all you can!
-Bags...
-Hold firm, hey?
-So???
-Two minutes...
-This is better
-Yes, but I still cannot pull the rope
Shoes!
Be careful...
I dropped everything now!
-Pitch your curb chain!
-What??
Pitch your golden chain there!
But it has no weight?!
Popeye!! He has an enormous golden curb chain, and he doesn't want to pitch it, shit...
It's a family cameo. I'm not gonna pitch my chain?!
Pitch it! Pitch it!
You won't bring it back!
That's it? did he drop it?
Did you drop it?
My curby chain...
That's it, it's better: I'll pull you up!
Hey man...
Why don't you enjoy the bench to sleep for a while...
At least one of us would have rest...
No... Sleeping is dying!
-Haaa... Be carefull to my shoulder...
-Excuse me...
Closer to you my god...
closer to you...
Living, misterious...
HHHaaa!! THERE!
See, we were not far from the village!
Huh? 400 meters only!
But you have to know the place.
Well, I'm gonna call the vicarage
to warn your friends and tell them you arrived.
"Parisians, face of dogs...
Parigots, face of calf"
Go home, you!
Hey? Is there some beasts?!
But this is so beautiful!
Your place is really stylish!
Well that's it, just have to wait for your friends to come to get you
Maybe they are hungry after their adventures?!
Ho no, we don't want to take advantage, you've already been so kind!
Me honnestly, I'm dying of starvation...
Me too, I wouldn't mind having a bit e of something...
So, just say it!
Can you smell this scent of wood fire?
Oh, it's so sweet in there place
And it's clean. I would eat on the floor.
I'm sure they have raw ham from mountains...
Do you know they still kill raw ham by themselves?
Me I'm so hungry that I would eat anything!
My god... this lace!
But look at this lace
It's so fine!!
Ho...
There's no TV!
Ha, this is not "baguette"!
-I did it...
-Well congratulations, your bread/breast(buttock) are very rounded!
This, is a receipe from the country!
It's named...
The "foune"!
-Smell this!
-Oh, it's ok. You know, it looks good!
We're gonna serve it "rubbed on".
Like in our traditions!
Which means... we rub it on the bread.
Thanks.
And what is that, inside?
Whell that...
That is done with all the rests of cheese of the year
We macerate it with fat...
wood alcohol, during...
two or three seasons.
And we put the rinds of ham in it too!
Eat kid!!
You're gonna become a real mountain man!
There's not such a thing to get back your energy!
Humm.. it's delicious...
We can feel well the taste of fat...
It doens't 	go unnoticed!
This one is at least 3 years old
That's too say how good it is!
What are these white things inside?
This? It's worms
Well yes, like that, there is meat too!
I'm vegetarian.
The small animal isn't gonna eat the big one!
Excuse me, I need to go out!
Christiane! You're here?
Waou... You just scrapped me...
like an old sock!
But no... We got in some troubles, you were right not to wait for us.
I was aching... to wait
At one moment I felt so alone that I wanted to kill myself!
So i ate the dozens of oysters...
What happened, why didn't you wait for me?
Cause we made a mistake on the track, so now we have to go and get the others.
-Are they on the tracks?
-No, they were picked by some peasants.
But it's the police station that told us, we have to go.
-Consonant?
-S.
-Vowel?
-I.
-Mister Geoffroy?
-Sorry, 7.
-Miss Parion?
-Not better.
-"Ambulés"
-"Ambulés"!
There was "Blumaise", in 8 letters!
Ha, here are your friends who came to get you!
-Good evening gentlemen!
-Good evening!
Well gentlemen...
We thank you a lot!
It's nothing, nothing...
-You were 500 meters from the village...
-Only thing is, people have to know the mountain
Yes, yes... People have to know the mountain...
Although we wouldn't have got here, if these gentlemen didn't come, right?
Take me...
Listen gentlemen, we'll just thank you a lot for your hospitality
And we're gonna leave
You're not gonna leave like that, without drinking a little something, right?
Oh no no...
We don't have time now
Ho we do, we do, we do...
Gladly! it will be a pleasure!
I'm gonna get the bottle then!
You are a bit harsh!
They are charming, without them you would still be in the mountain!
It's the least we can do, no?
You are crazy, you don't know what they eat...
But it's very good!
Here it is!
Tell me, hum...
How do you do to creep the... hum... into...
toad(big frog)... into the bottle?
So we make it dry...
Then it becomes very thin...
So it comes in.
Then with damp, it balloons.
Not too much, hey...
That's it!
Thanks...
So this, you have to drink bottoms up (na ex)!
Otherwise... It burns your tongue...
It does good!
Your turn now.
Well...
Cheers (Nazdravie), hey?!
Cheers...
Thanks, hey...
And good luck, above all...
Ha, the cap jumped
It's strong...
It would clear the toilets!
It's not a drink for wimps!
What is this shit?!
It's liquor from shallot (a kind of onion)
But deviled with garlic juce
Cause shallot alone is a bit flavourless
Very fruity...
It's tasty, hey...
It has some "return".
Ho, holy cow...
So what's your address?
Cause i'm coming to Paris in a month with a girl...
It's for 15 days, 3 weeks, so it would help me out for, hum...
hosting... You know!
-Where we live?
-Well yes, i mean your address...
It's hum... 10, rue Montmartre
-Hey?
-It's 10 rue Montmartre!
In which surrounding is this?
-The 3rd.
-The 12th...
-The 3rd, Nathalie!
I confused with the floor...
And the phone number?
-Hum, we don't have it yet
-It's a modern flat, there's no phone...
But hum... You no longer live in Meudon?
Mais euh... vous n'habitez plus Meudon?
No... hum yes...
The point is...
When we arrive, we'll move imediatly!
We found something more lighty, more spacious...
-Well we go!
-Bye kids!
My darling, you come whenever you want...
If some people want to descend, feel free.
I have place.
It will be without me, thanks
It's very nice, thank you Bernard
And say hi to Olive...
Ciao honney...
Get safe home and transmit all my friendship to Marius
Go!
Ho la la... Popeye is nice but he's like glue!
You know earlier?
You had the presence of mind
Cause I would have given him the right address
Well yeah, he's the kind of guy who comes to live at your place for 3 months!
Ultimately, he's a boy who's nicer if not known!
What's nice with Bernard and Nathalie...
It's that they are really generous!
It's true, they are open handed
I barely asked them, and they proposed me to house me!
Hey look, Miss Schmitt is out of the clinic
Ho shit...
Madam? Aaah Madam...
So?
