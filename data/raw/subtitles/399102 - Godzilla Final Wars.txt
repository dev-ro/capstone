Godzilla directly ahead! Target lock!
Fire!
Keep to your posts!
Prepare to launch missiles!
Preparing missiles!
It's an earthquake!
Fire into the glacier!
Repeated wars and
environmental disruptions...
As science advanced, earth's
environment paid the ultimate price.
Giant monsters began to appear.
A race of mutants, seemingly human,
emerged as mankind's enemies.
But later joined forces with
them to fight the monsters.
The Earth Defense Force (EDF) is born.
Possessing special physical abilities,
more mutants began to appear.
The EDF organized a special military
unit consisting of humans and mutants.
This elite unit is called Organization-M.
But the greatest enemy of the EDF...
...plunged the world into
a crisis of extinction.
It appeared for the first time in 1954.
It's name is...
Can't maintain this. We must surface.
Depth is 6700 meters!
We're already beyond our limit!
Inside temperature now
at 80 degrees Celsius!
Captain!
Temperature now at 90 Celsius!
Captain! We can't take anymore!
Manda in pursuit!
Automatic firing system down!
Manda is terminated.
Ship damage at 72%.
Colonel Gordon, were you
planning on sinking the Gotengo?
You can't avoid a court martial this time.
Enough!
If this was a real fight, Ozaki would be dead.
Lucky for you this is only an exercise.
Kazama, don't get carried away.
But I won the fight.
Listen, the purpose of training is not
to become stronger than your partner.
Then what's the point?
To become stronger than you were yesterday.
Okay.
Ozaki...
Come to my quarters later.
Yes, sir!
Attention!
Wait!
Why did you hold back?
Were you trying to lose?
No. You won.
Listen, let me tell you something.
You can't act that way during a real fight.
Your gentleness is fatal on the battlefield.
How can you protect
people without gentleness?
You are overly optimistic.
Don't forget, we are Mutants.
We were born not to
protect people, but to fight.
It's our mission to attack.
The fossil of an unknown
monster was found in Hokkaido...
...and brought to the Defense Museum.
A great scholar is coming from
the United Nations to examine it.
You'll be the scholar's
personal security guard.
Is that all?
Yes. It's an easy job.
This isn't a job for Organization-M.
The Gotengo is now in dry-dock and under
repairs after the battle with Manda.
Col. Gordon was pissed off at the
conference and hit his superior.
He's in the punishment room.
You need a change of scenery.
Anyhow, this great scholar from the
UN must be an old, argumentative...
Sorry for being so argumentative.
This is Ms. Miyuki Otonashi,
a molecular biologist.
Are you really a scholar?
You look more like a model.
I always thought Mutants were dumb
grunts who only know how to fight.
After meeting you, it seems that I was right.
Yeah, that's true.
It seems there is also a model
who thinks she is a biologist.
First of all, let's get something clear.
What?
Don't disturb my job.
Don't talk to me except
when I ask you something.
But I...
- In fact...
Don't even look at me except
when you have business with me.
Babysitting a woman.
A job that suits you.
Try a little harder.
I've studied it thoroughly.
A fusion body of machine and living creature.
Should I call it a cyborg monster?
After full analysis, I'd say it's
approximately 12,000 years old.
Could such a creation actually
be possible 12,000 years ago?
Not possible. Not on this planet, at least.
You mean, this monster
came from another planet?
Here, the M-base is detected.
Yes. Human beings are
made up of 4 components:
Adenine, guanine, cytosine, and chemin.
But mutants have a fifth unknown
one, which we call M-base.
M-base is detected in this monster, too.
Mutants is not mutations...
But somehow biologically related to
this monster from 12,000 years ago.
That means this monster is kind
of an ancestor to you guys.
That's ridiculous.
Do you have any special thoughts, as the
first Japanese UN Secretary General?
I believe the human race has
the ability to solve any problem.
The logic and science
that we brought about...
And the reason and courage to solve
any mystery mankind encounters.
For example, the root of life
that is not yet discovered...
...and overcome any and
all unknown menaces.
I am convinced that such a day is upon us.
Mr. Daigo, are you going
to New York after this?
Yes.
I'm traveling so much these days, I
feel as if I were living on an airplane.
It's a pity I don't see Clint
very much these days.
Clint?
Yes. He's my dog.
Oh, you have a doggy!
He hasn't changed his attitude, even
since I became the Secretary General.
Prof. Jiguji, here it is.
Infant Island?
This...
That monster's name is Gigan.
Where are we?
Welcome to Infant Island.
We have brought you here to tell
you something very important.
Gigan came to this island 12,000 years
ago and caused great destruction.
Mothra tried to stop it.
That's what this ancient art depicts.
Gigan is a wicked creature.
And its wicked blood streams down to you.
Me?
You have the power to decide
what path you will choose.
As long as you don't become an enemy
to the earth, Mothra is on your side.
What was that?
Did we all have a hallucination?
No. It wasn't a hallucination.
Please take this.
This is a charm from the
ancient times of this Island.
Mr. Daigo. Here's the
document for the meeting.
Oh, thank you.
New York is under attack by Rodan.
We've dispatched Rumbling to the scene.
What about Mr. Daigo's plane?
It's still missing.
Commander Namikawa, Angilas
has appeared in Shanghai!
Dispatch Karyu right away!
Commander!
King Seesar has appeared in Okinawa!
Kamakiras is in Paris!
Sydney is under attack!
What on earth?
Damn it! Don't let it get the upper hand!
Fire missiles!
Fire Maser!
Don't let it get away!
After it!
Who are you?
I'll shoot!
Who do you think I am?
Grandpa, don't shoot him!
He's scared!
Grandpa!
What's going on here?
Damage report!
Captain!
Fire missiles!
Oh, you're strong.
There's an energy plant 1 KM away.
So we'll stop 'em right here!
Ozaki and Kazama make a team.
You guys blast the hell out of him.
Then, while it's preoccupied
with the attack...
Ozaki and Kazama will
shoot it with the masers.
Let's have fried shrimp for dinner!
Roger!
Go!
Fire!
We've got it now.
What the hell is happening?
A UFO in Paris!
Kamakiras has disappeared!
Also in Okinawa! King
Seesar has disappeared!
Kumonga as well!
All the monsters are disappearing!
The flying objects are gathering.
What's the projected target area?
Point 0.00.
That's here!
Commander, you're in danger here.
I don't care. The danger
is the same everywhere.
Secretary General Daigo!
What's happening here?
They helped me make a narrow escape.
They...?
Yes, my friends...
You mean, extraterrestrials?
They came from a far-off planet.
They come in peace.
We are all about to bear
witness to an historic moment.
Greetings.
Nice to meet you.
We come in peace.
How do we know that?
We've already helped you in
ways you don't yet understand.
The monsters that were ravaging your
planet, they're gone now, because of us.
We come from a place far
beyond your solar system.
Our intentions are peaceful.
Earthlings cannot pronounce
the name of our star.
So, you can call it Planet X.
What is your purpose here?
A crisis approaches the earth.
A huge asteroid will soon
collide with your planet.
It will collide with the earth in 11, 736
hours, 17 minutes and 32 seconds from now.
31, 30, 29. Every second it draws closer.
It is called Gorath.
There is only one way to stop
Gorath from destroying your planet.
With our help, you must gather all of
earth's armaments in one place and attack.
We are all witness to these historic events.
This is a great opportunity for us to advance
in ways we never imagined possible.
With the help of our new friends...
We can learn limitless new
science, technology and medicine.
This universe has now become one.
The days of the United Nations are now over.
This is the beginning of the Space Nations!
This is an open area in Tokyo
with a great view of the UFO.
As for the UFO, no one is
permitted to approach it...
...as it is now under the
management of the EDF.
However, look.
A large number of people
continue flocking here...
...day after day, to have a look at the X-ians.
The aura of enthusiasm escalates!
Today's guest is... not Kenji Kohashi,
because he's changed his name.
X.
X? Why X?
It's cool, isn't it. I became an X-ian today.
It's a kind of a collaboration between
planets. To promote an certain unity...
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll just call you Girly-boy. That
suits you better, doesn't it?
Yeah, it does.
- It sure does!
Isn't it great that the
X-ian are visiting Japan?
Now we want to get reaction
from our celebrity panelists.
First, how about you, Mr. Otsuki?
There is something wrong here.
The purpose of an extraterrestrial
is for earth aggression...
You're what's wrong!
You've always clamed there were no
extraterrestrials, now here they are! Idiot!
What scientific proof do we have that
they're actually from another planet?
You only talk about scientific crap and so on.
You're dreaming. Wake
up and smell the coffee!
This is no dream, and you usually
have more constructive things to say.
Thank you!
To finally have direct contact with
extraterrestrial life is a scientist's dream...
I agree.
This could be a great opportunity.
There's no point in denying
that they're actually here.
I'm not trying to deny it!
If it is so, I will accept it!
I think we're are all in for
a bad experience soon.
I agree with the middle-aged guy.
Soon after Gigan is discovered to be
from another planet, X shows up.
There is no proof of a connection
between Gigan and X.
You need proof, do you?
Sister!
Anna Otonashi! She's your sister!?
You look good, Miyuki.
And you have a cool boyfriend!
Boyfriend!? No way!
So what proof do you have?
Look carefully.
Yes, there's something wrong.
I don't know what, but he's weird.
Notice something unusual?
He's not blinking.
It's impossible for a human not to blink.
Anyway, let's pay him a visit.
Nice to see you again.
Mr. Daigo.
Long time no see Secretary General Daigo.
Who are you?
I'm Anna Otonashi of Nitto TV.
I'm in a hurry, what can I do for you?
I think your idea about the
space alliance is brilliant.
I'd like to pass the message to all
the world through our TV program.
Okay, I'll get back to you.
Soon, if possible!
I don't have any time now.
How's your doggy?
Doggy?
Yes, your dog.
Oh, my dog...
X-ian devil! He's an X-ian devil!
He's one of them! We must kill them
before they kill us all! Listen to me!
Mr. Daigo, you're bleeding!
Are you all right? You should see a doctor.
It's no big deal.
You should get emergency first aid...
I said I'm fine!
Miyuki...
This... is not the blood of a human being!
I thought so...
There is no creature on earth
with this blood composition.
Daigo must be an X alien.
May I come in?
I'm Ozaki, second lieutenant.
At ease. What is it?
Yes. This is about Mr. Daigo.
He has become a major
activist for the Space Alliance.
There's a problem? Continue.
There has already been
one attempt on his life.
I think that we should increase
security in order to protect him.
I'm aware of all this. Thank you.
Yes, ma'am. Excuse me.
What is it you want to say?
We have all these monsters and can
annihilate these people whenever we want.
Why are we wasting time like this?
You're still young.
Not every situation is to be settled by force.
Sometimes things can be handled peacefully.
However, if we use our power...
Silence!
About face!
One who relies on power will
eventually fall to a stronger power.
Remember that!
These pictures came from the same time,
but from a completely different place.
They look exactly the same.
Yes, they are the same.
When I put these photos on top of each
other, there was no difference at all.
This can't be true. This must
be some kind of holograph.
You mean, Gorath doesn't exist?
This all may be a X-ian plot.
Not only Mr. Daigo, but
also Cmdr. Namikawa...
Those two have been
taken over by the X aliens?
We can't trust anyone.
There is one person we can trust.
Someone I know X aliens haven't gotten to.
Col. Gordon.
What do you mean by that?
Hello everyone.
We're broadcasting live from the UN building.
We have Secretary General Daigo
and two X representatives with us.
Thank you for coming.
What are you doing with Mr. Daigo's data?
You've become quite inquisitive lately.
Major General Kunikida.
If you study too hard, you'll
know what needs to be done.
What are you going to
do with me, Ms. X alien?
If you know that much, then you must die.
You finally show your true colors.
Damned humans...
We won't have our plans disrupted
by such lowly creatures like you!
Are you all right?
Are you?
I'm okay.
Mr. Daigo, we have a surprise visitor today.
Oh, who is that?
What? Have you forgotten?
Oh, that's right! That's my dog!
Go and say hello to Mr. Daigo.
Mr. Daigo, please call his
name. He'll be very happy.
Name?
Have you forgotten his name?
Poor thing...
Young lady, please tell
Mr. Daigo the dog's name.
Mr. Daigo's dog's name is Clint.
Yes, that's right! Clint!
Clint, come here!
Sorry Clint I couldn't remember
your name. How are you, Clint?
He doesn't seem to be in a good mood
since I haven't seen him for a long time.
Candy, come here Candy!
Your memory must be bad, this is my dog.
But you said my dog...
What? I never said this is your dog.
This is really fun!
What do you have to say, now?
Look at this! This is what
an X-ian really looks like!
Please explain this!
Well... there's...
You see, it's like this...
What an interesting change of events.
The fun is only just beginning.
I'm the new Controller.
Hello, human beings of earth...
Or should I say, domesticated animals.
You exist only to be dominated by us.
This face isn't too bad for
a domesticated animal.
It is useless for you to resist us.
Both our science and weaponry
are superior to yours.
We have all the monsters
under our control as well.
You don't have a chance.
Wait.
Stupid domesticated animals.
You have no idea what you're up against.
Kazama! What's wrong?
Kazama!
You're also a Mutant.
I leave this for you.
Get out of here. I'll handle this.
They need you. I'm expendable.
Please save the earth, Captain.
Run!
Ozaki?
Gigan, awaken!
Drop all of the monsters on earth!
Make these savages feel like the
domesticated animals they are.
This is our playground.
Destroy the previous civilization!
Don't give up! Fight until the last breath!
Captain! Angilas is on the right!
What the...!?
Looks like things are well under control.
These savages are getting their asses kicked.
Useless.
Now what? Kenta, let's go!
By the way, what's his name?
Minya. His name is Minya.
Minya? Okay then. Let's
go, Kenta and Minya!
All communication from the
outside has been cut off.
For some reason, they haven't
discovered this emergency hangar.
How about repairs? Is it fixed yet?
Yes. Gotengo is the only thing we have left.
You shouldn't move for a while.
Ozaki...
Why didn't you kill me?
Because you're my friend.
They'll find this place sooner or
later! We need to attack them!
Ozaki, don't become emotional.
Gotengo is our last hope.
The South Pole?
Area G...
You want to awaken Godzilla?
It's too dangerous. Godzilla
will destroy the world.
But if Godzilla is being controlled by them...
That's all right. Godzilla doesn't have M-base.
All the X aliens, Gigan...
...and part of Ebirah which was
stuck to Kazama's body have M-base.
And of course, all the Mutants, too.
That's right.
The X-ians and the monsters
have a common gene...
...which give them power to control them.
Then why wasn't I affected?
You're not controlled.
That's the important thing.
If we use Godzilla to destroy the enemy...
How do we deal with Godzilla afterwards?
It's not that easy...
So, what you're saying is...
We fight our way to the South Pole.
Blast Godzilla free and take him back.
Then have him fight the monsters.
Meantime, we defeat the X aliens somehow.
Then we go back to the South
Pole and confine Godzilla again?
Understood.
Miyuki, be careful.
You too, sis.
Please come back alive and well.
Well, there's still an interesting toy left.
Gigan, go.
Captain, Gigan approaching!
Main engine has stopped!
Power circuits have cut off!
Fire missiles!
What is that monster?
I am your enemy. And Godzilla's enemy is...
This one!
Here he comes!
Repairs completed!
Start engines!
Godzilla is following us.
Where should we go?
Godzilla, let's see how strong you are.
Good for nothing tuna eating monster!
Next!
So earth does have something strong.
Interesting.
Why is Godzilla destroying that town?
Long before you were born,
humans did a terrible thing...
And made Godzilla very angry.
Terrible thing?
Yes.
You're to young to understand yet...
But humans made a huge fire
that cause much destruction.
Godzilla never forgot the
anger he felt at that time.
What's the matter?
Hey, what's wrong?
What are you doing?
Are you okay?
In the end, all of my
research was meaningless.
We can now control our own destiny.
Your contributions will be
needed again... after the war.
Hey, how come you're still fighting?
Even though you know there's no chance.
I was assigned to protect you. That's my job.
Hey, Minya, where are we going?
Now what will you do, Godzilla?
What are you doing?
What's the matter, Minya?
You've finally arrived.
Masers launched!
One of the jet fighters have launched.
I owe you a debt.
What are you doing?
It's suicide!
Wait!
I leave the rest to you, Ozaki.
Stop! Kazama!
Coming into our place by drilling...
You're such rude domesticated animals.
Kill the useless animals.
Well, everything is pretty much cleaned up.
Take them.
Just a moment.
It's no good.
Earthlings, do you understand our power?
We must take a certain mitochondria
from your cells to survive.
In other words, we must harvest you alive.
Harvest us alive?
At first, we destroyed your civilization so
that you didn't realize our true intentions.
We will be harvesting a new crop soon.
You can live here like a domesticated animal.
This is our ranch and you are
the animals awaiting slaughter.
You're not funny.
Both civilization and
science are useless to you.
You are doomed by your own destruction
and history of massacre anyway.
We will rule over you so that
will never happen again.
By the way, it's almost
time for the main event!
Together we will all witness
the last of Godzilla.
Godzilla isn't all that powerful.
Another nuisance.
Your enemy is a new, more powerful Gigan!
How are you going to defeat us now?
How should I kill our friends?
Friends?
X-ians and Mutants are
the same, isn't that right?
M-base was also discovered in X-ian blood.
We're not the same. We have
plenty of M-base on our planet.
M-base is a material influenced
by telepathic ability.
Therefore Mutants can be
controlled, as well as Gigan.
You're bright for an earthling.
Mutants are descendants of our ancestors.
But unfortunately, you couldn't control me.
You're an exception. Your power
hasn't been developed enough.
What?
You're a Kaiser.
A Mutant that is half earthling half X-ian.
The odds of such a creature
being born are on in thousands.
You and I have one thing is common...
We're both Kaisers.
You have the ability to surpass
both human and X-ian.
Ozaki!
Wake up, Kaiser!
Kaiser, as a start, kill them all.
No! Don't!
I...
This is boring. We should
kill these useless ones.
Keep your eyes on them.
This is our planet.
Secretary General Daigo!
Ms. Otonashi!
You're all okay!
I managed to escape from them by myself.
They used to call me "Mr. Infallible."
Captain, please get everyone out of here.
His ass is mine.
You wouldn't hit a lady.
How many times must I tell you?
You only exist to be ruled... as pets.
My existence...
The only one who could
decide my existence is me.
We are not domesticated animals.
We are human beings.
You are a fool to support these animals
while having the power to control all!
I won't die alone!
You're not taking me with you!
Cmdr. Namikawa!
Let's go!
Pull that lever! Hurry up!
Pull the lever with all your might!
It's sucking the life force out of Godzilla.
If only we can give power to Godzilla...
All systems negative!
What's that!?
Hey Godzilla, you've done
enough, haven't you?
Damn you!
What are you doing?
Minya!
Welcome back!
Everything is finally over.
No, a new war as begun...
