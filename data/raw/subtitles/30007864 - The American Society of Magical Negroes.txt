He's a perfectly fine designer,
but he's, like,
totally convinced
that he's on the fast track.
- Great. What else?
- He responds more to
'90s hip-hop slang
than Uncle Remus.
What about his Want?
I mean, those are all
great observations,
but we need to find out
what he's missing.
Honestly, I'm not sure.
You know, best I can tell
is that, for some reason,
his meter jumped
when his last project launched.
Is he close to anyone at work?
He has a work wife.
So, spend some time with her.
Get some intel.
With her? Yeah.
Yeah, I could do that.

She's-she's smart

Have you seen her work?
She's, like,

Yeah. -She's, like,
the best designer here.
Yeah, she's definitely
the golden child.

You know, th-they're
actually saying that

Thanks, man.
Yeah, y-you guys
are completely different.
You're-you're actually--
You-you work
really well together.

It's like you have such talent,

It's like,
it's like a power couple.

MeetBox is under fire,
as new complaints emerge its
facial recognition technology
fails to identify Black people.
Critics say a lack of diversity
on the engineering team
may have contributed
to the issue.
And with public pressure
growing,
MeetBox founder
Mick Morton has promised
sweeping internal changes.
(club remix of a sea shanty
playing)
(song ends)
- Ahoy. -Ahoy.
- Ahoy.
(light laughter)
When I dropped out of Harvard
to build MeetBox
in my parents' garage,
I remember thinking,
"I hope they don't
pull the car in."
(laughter)
I also remember thinking
MeetBox had to be
a platform for everybody.
Now, in the next few days,
you're gonna hear
the media claim
that we have failed at that.
You're gonna hear
outlandish accusations.
"Mick's biased.
"Mick's a racist.
Mick hates
the entire nation of Ghana."
That's not me.
It's not who we are.
We are the same company that,
last quarter alone,
partnered with
22 Black-owned vendors.
We are the same company that,
during the
George Floyd protests,
suspended operations
for 12 hours.
We're the same company
whose flagship office
has a world cuisine station
dedicated to the food
of the Caribbean
and occasionally Africa.
It's diverse, it's different,
it's yummy.
We like it.
That's who we are.
(applause)
But to make it crystal clear
who we are,
I am thrilled to announce
that in the next 30 days,
we are relaunching
the MeetBox brand.
At a company-wide presentation,
our top design team will pitch
a MeetBox makeover.
We're gonna have a new logo,
a new slogan
and a new commitment
to the exact same values
that got us here.
- He's incredible.
- Hmm.
So that's Jason's Want:
to be like Mick.
Mick's a CEO.
That makes Jason
a five-, ten-year client.
And those are different.
Less magic, more listening.
Yeah, it's actually fun
and weirdly relaxing.
It's like being a secret agent
with none of the danger.
(magical jingling)
♪ ♪
So, uh, I actually had
a question for you
about Jason's work wife.
Aren, just ask the girl out.
- Can I?
- We're not monks, Aren.
You're just scared to ask her.
- I'm getting to it, all right?
- When?
Tomorrow.
(Roger laughing)
ROGER:
Okay.
- Dude.
- Whoa.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Seriously, man.
It was like an epiphany.
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.
Sorry, what-what are
we talking about?
Lizzie.
- What?
- Don't play dumb, man.
I know what you were doing,
going on about her.
You were trying to...
you were trying to set us up.
No. No, no, no.
That's not what I was doing.
- I was...
- It's okay. It's cool.
I'm grateful because
you got me thinking,
"Why haven't we
gotten together?"
And then it hit me.
I'm into Lizzie.
Hey, man, you were, um,
you were pretty focused on
being like Mick.
I am.
You want both things?
I do.
- Isn't that cool?
- Yeah.
Clarity is dope, man.
(stammers) Right.
- He wants both things?
- Yeah, can he even do that?
Yes, but a Double Want is not
ideal for your first client.
Okay, great, well, then
I'm just gonna focus on work
and let him
deal with his love life.
You know, the company's
about to do the big rebrand,
- and so I feel like...
- No.
You're going to concentrate on
both things at once.
And, Aren, I hope
I don't have to tell you this,
but you cannot have a romantic
relationship with Lizzie now.
Is that going to be a problem?
Because if you don't
put Jason first,
everyone's magic will fail.
I was hoping that was, like,
a team-building thing.
We're all in this together now.
So you have to set up
Lizzie and Jason,
and I have to drive around
this crotchety old white lady.
Oh. Lizzie texted me.
What should I say?
Let's start with what
she said. -Okay, she said,
"Can I get
that timeline, please?"
What do you think it means?
Hey. You two talking about me?
(clicks tongue)
- Hey.
- What's up? Hey.
Oh, my-- Wait, are you?
Yeah, actually, we were.
We were just, uh, wondering
if you wanted to get a drink
- with us after work, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh.
Okay, yeah. That sounds great.
Um, as long as Jason
gets me that timeline.
Yeah, it's-- Yeah, it's chill.
Okay, great.
Let me know about drinks.
AREN:
All right.
(Jason sighs)
- (chuckles): Thank you.
- Yeah, you're welcome.
Geez. -I'll just, uh,
I'll make up an excuse
last minute, and then
you guys are all set. -What?
- All right?
- No, no. No, no, no, no.
You... You're coming.
- Why?
- Did you just see me?
"It's chill"?
- Okay.
- I've never said "chill."
All right, yeah, okay, fine.
I'll come for one drink,
all right?
- Should I send the timeline?
- Yeah, send it now.
Send it? -You should
probably send it now.
AREN: So Jason and I
worked on it for a week,
and then... -Yeah, and then...
and then Masterson
fell asleep
right in front of me.
- (laughing): Oh, my God.
- (laughing)
That's pretty funny.
Your stories are
getting better.
- It was good, right?
- Yeah, it's good.
- I'm getting funnier.
- You're making my job easier.
- Maybe. (laughing)
- Yeah.
Should we do another round?
- Should we do one more?
- Yeah. -Yeah.
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Yeah? Okay.
- No, I got it.
- You got it?
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you.
ANCHOR (over TV):
...country music superstar.
In other news, the fallout from
MeetBox's facial recognition
scandal continues.
The technology required
to access the platform
has prevented
the entire nation of Ghana
from logging on
for several days.
Well, on the one hand,
it's been great for
my productivity at work.
But on the other hand,
it was quite racist.
ANCHOR: The growing outcry
made its way to social media,
where the hashtag "Ghanagate"
has been trending...
I'm so sick of this, this whole
facial recognition thing.
God, I know.
It was a mistake.
Oh, no, I meant, like, I'm
just so sick of thinking about
how we all work for these
people who are responsible.
So what? So everybody who was
on that team is a bad person?
- (beeping, whirring)
- I didn't say that. Um...
Wait, did you--
Was that your last project?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
And we were doing our best,
you know, and...
I'm-I'm sorry.
I forgot that you were on that.
- No, it's... I don't care.
- AREN: Yeah.
I was just
blowing off steam about...
People are being
really sensitive right now.
You know,
it's a hot-button issue
- right now.
- Yeah.
That's totally
what I was commenting on.
- Right.
- You're not a bad person.
- Oh, not at all.
- Right. Right. Yeah, no.
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine, it's fine.
But, yeah, thank you.
You're good.
And, look, I mean,
would it have helped
to have people of color
on the team?
Maybe. Yeah.
But...
you know, it was
a really competitive project,
and no people like you made it,
so I don't know
what they want me to do.
I think, uh, you shouldn't
beat yourself up over it.
- Yeah. Exactly.
- That's the main thing.
Yeah.
Right.
And I'm not.
Like, I thought about it
for a few minutes
I'm moving on.
Cause you can't--
you cannot slow down
and listen to the haters and...
(newscast playing quietly
over radio)
(Lizzie sighs)
What?
No, I should've said something.
You did.
You-you said exactly
what I was thinking
- about the whole scandal.
- Yeah, and then
Jason got all guilty, and I
just, like, completely bailed.
(groans) I'm so stupid.
No, don't... it's...
You were trying to make him
feel better, you know.
We both were.
Yeah, well, now I feel worse.
I mean, don't you?
It's okay to...
pick your battles.
That's the thing. I feel like
I'm not really picking.
It just feels like this reflex.
Okay, that doesn't make sense.
No, actually that makes
perfect sense.
It's like when...
when someone sneezes,
how you say "Bless you"
without even thinking.
Only then you look up
afterwards,
and you're like, "What did I...
What did I just bless?"
- Yeah.
- Right.
Yeah.
I don't know.
It's-it's one thing
to not stand up for myself,
but then when
I-I look over and I see
that you're uncomfortable, too,
it's just...
I should've said something.
Thank you... for saying that.
That's-that's really...
That's really nice.
I don't have a lot of people
that stick up for me, so...
Well, I didn't
stick up for you.
I just thought about it.
JASON: Well, Lizzie pulled me
aside this morning
and was rehashing
our conversation at the bar,
and apparently I upset her.
- Wait, what?
- I know.
But you weren't upset, right?
No, no.
Good.
- Wow.
- Right?
Cause I obviously care
very deeply
about this stuff, and I take it
really seriously, but...
Honestly, I didn't even know
she was, like, ethnic at first.
So, like, don't come at me
when you're...
you're me.
You know?
You gonna serve?
Uh, yeah. Sorry.
(clears throat)
Um, are you and Lizzie
good, though?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, she was basically
flirting with me
by the end of it.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, she does this thing
where she, like,
touches my arm and...
- Easy.
- Sorry.
It's, uh...
You got any more balls?
- Yeah, I got one.
- Okay.
GABBARD:
Our society began
as an informal commitment
amongst Monticello slaves
to help each other avoid
harsh punishment.
(quietly): Now that I can see
white discomfort everywhere,
I'm starting to realize
all of this stuff
that it does to me.
Like, I apologize all the time.
- You really should hear this.
- Oh, sorry.
See?
And you were so right about
how I've been aware of this
my whole life.
Like, I was never really able
to explain my sculpture before,
but I-I think it's about...
Roger?
(sighs)
R-Roger?
Am I making sense?
You haven't been making sense
for quite some time.
Sorry.
Lizzie, your...
your work on the logo
has been just...
- just great.
- Aw.
I mean, it was
a team effort. I...
Well, I know that you did
all the heavy lifting, so...
- I do.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
- Aw.
I just want you to know
how great you are.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.
It's just, um...
our team is gonna be pitching
the logo to Mick himself.
- Mm-hmm.
- And I'm gonna ask...
I'm gonna ask Jason to do it.
But it's...
I'm sorry, that's my, um,
design, though, you know.
No, I know.
Uh, Jason's just better
in a room, and--
- He's great in a room.
- Um, is he?
- He's so charismatic and...
- He's loud and he's...
Well, it's a loud...
company, Lizzie.
Sorry, I just feel like
I've been, I've been asking you
for something like this
for a long time. -Mm-hmm. Sure.
And we... we talked about this
in my review. -Sure.
This particular design
means a lot to me, and...
Okay, well, I'm up for
Rear Admiral this year.
No, Lizzie, Rear Admiral.
- Okay, yeah, um...
- And we should just really
support each other right now.
- Yeah, so...
- I heard about that.
That's great.
It's a big presentation,
and Jason's just a better fit
for this audience.
(pats leg)
- You'll be fine.
- No, that's okay. Um...
(phone chiming)
Oh, Masterson's calling me in.
I'll meet you
and Lizzie at the bar.
All right.
Hey.
I'm sorry, I-I actually--
I have to head home.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Shit, um...
Thank you.
Look, um, we don't
have to go to the bar.
We can just walk
in that direction and talk.
Sorry, I'm just-- I'm not
super, uh, fun right now.
It's okay.
No, I'm really, uh...
I'm no fun.
I think, uh, this is fun enough
for the both of us.
Oh, my God.
Is this a ring that says
"So swag"?
Okay, you love that.
- It's very fun.
- That was a gag gift.
- So...
- It's almost too fun.
-"So swag."
- Okay.
Um...
A short, un-fun walk?
All right.
Completely joyless.
LIZZIE:
It's my job to support Jason,
in more ways
than you can imagine,
but, I mean, I don't know.
I think
I'm a good designer also.
- AREN: You're the best of us.
- (stammers) I mean, I don't,
I don't know if I'm the best,
but, like... -No, you are.
I went to RISD
with some great designers,
- and you're killing it.
- Thank you.
- I mean that.
- That means a lot.
Thank you. I...
Like, if I'm being honest,
I kind of... (sighs)
I kind of think that, too.
And that's, like,
this whole thing for me.
Like, it's taken me years
to just be able to say, like,
you know, "I think,
like, I, as a person,
do not suck fundamentally."
And it's...
(sighs) This place is supposed
to be a meritocracy, so...
Mick? Like, Mick is
a free market psychopath.
If there was a way to promote
with blood sport,
oh, my God, he'd be
throwing us in the pit,
- like, left and right.
- (laughs)
And I'm just saying,
"Put me in the pit.
- Like, I'm there."
- Yeah.
"I'm committed.
I'm-I'm good."
Can I just say,
you're kind of a badass...
right now.
I mean, at all times,
- but specifically right now...
- Thank you.
...because I feel like--
I keep thinking this
because, uh, with me,
when I lose an opportunity,
I'm like, "Yeah, that's right.
That makes sense.
And goodbye
and thank you so much."
And you're-- right now,
you're, like... -Wait.
This...
I don't even have the word
for it. -But why?
That how much I don't have it.
You went to RISD. I mean...
- That's different.
- No, it's not at all.
That's like the Harvard
of finger painting.
That's how they sell it.
It's on all the pamphlets.
- Exactly. I mean, it's...
- (laughs)
Yeah, it's amazing
to even get in there.
- What did you study?
- Sculpture.
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.
You still do it?
No. Not really, um, anymore.
I, uh...
I used to love it,
but it's sort of similar
- to what you were saying.
- What?
I couldn't decide if I was,
like, really good
and other people didn't get me
or if I was, like,
a lunatic
making yarn sculptures.
- Yarn sculptures?
- I know, I know.
Sculptures with yarn?
- Yeah.
- Do you have pictures?
- I do.
- Yeah?
Um...
- They don't really work in 2D.
- Oh, my God.
And they're too small
on this screen. -Are you sure?
- Let me see. (laughs)
- Come on!
- (Aren groans)
- (Lizzie chuckles)
This looks so cool.
Yeah, you don't really get the
feeling that you get in person.
Uh, okay, so if it was, like,
right in front of me,
what would I be feeling?
Calm.
Quiet.
Kind of like how I imagine
meditating is supposed to feel
but you can never
actually pull off.
Okay, so it's-it's,
like, relaxing?
I'm doing a terrible job
of this.
- Why are you making me do this?
- No, you're not.
- You're not.
- (chuckles)
Yeah, um...
I think my pieces are about...
comfort.
Mm-hmm.
Not like my shoes
are comfortable,
but deep social ease.
Like, I saw this Wall Street
bro get mugged one time.
- Uh, okay.
- It's an example.
- Okay. Okay. (chuckles)
- Deep social ease.
Uh, but when this guy
got mugged,
he was so surprised.
Yeah, I mean, isn't that
kind of essential to a mugging?
But no, it was the way
he was surprised.
It was...
Like, right before the mugging,
he was so sure that the world
wasn't gonna come for him
that it took him
a super long time to realize
that he was getting mugged.
I swear to God
that for a split second,
he thought the knife
was a present for him.
Like, in his mind, it was
more likely that a stranger
would give him
a random gift...
than that they would
try to hurt him.
Totally. Yeah.
And I-I want to know
what that would feel like
to have that expectation
of the world.
Just for a second.
Like I'm...
floating in salt water,
and I can just relax.
Well, what makes you
feel like that?
Peruvian wool.
(snickers)
And...
when people are talking to me.
- Like, me specifically.
- Mm.
Not an idea of me but
the person that I actually am.
And when does that happen?
Is it weird to say now?
(phone ringing, vibrating)
Sorry.
Hey. -JASON (over phone):
You sitting down?
AREN:

JASON:

And I just emailed you a temp,

Yeah. You got it. No problem.
Thanks, man.

Sorry, I've got to go back

But without our standard-issue

I didn't mean to put you off

Mm, thank you.

Hey, actually, um...
I actually had a suggestion
on the Lizzie front.
- JASON: Yeah, shoot.
- AREN: I was thinking
that you could ask Lizzie
to present with you.
Why? I mean, I do the talking,
you run the deck.
What else do we need?
Well, Lizzie's
a great designer,
and, you know,
it's a nice gesture,
especially for someone
that you're into.
JASON:
Yeah, but it's not fair.
AREN:
No.
You'd still have plenty
of face time with Mick.
JASON: No, it's-- I mean,
it's not fair to Lizzie.
What-- I-I don't follow.
Well, I mean,
if you give somebody a break
and they haven't earned it,
you're just setting them up
to fail down the line,
so it's not fair to them.
So you don't think
Lizzie's earned it?
Well, I mean,
Masterson did come to me, so...
Yeah, true, but it could've
been either of you.
- Could it?
- Yeah.
Well, I mean, I can only
speak for me, and I got it,
so I must have put in
the right amount of work.
Well, what if Lizzie put in
the exact same amount of work?
But she didn't get it.
So the fact that you have it
is proof that you deserve it?
Kinda.
Pick up that rapier there
and just stab them in the nose.
I mean, sure, there's luck
and talent and stuff,
but I feel like mostly
people get what they work for,
and I got it, Lizzie didn't.
But don't other things
contribute to your success?
Like what?
Like if people treat you
like you're gonna be successful
your whole life,
don't you think that makes it
easier to succeed?
- Like, me specifically?
- Sure.
Well, I was gonna succeed,
so they would've been right.
Uh, but what if
they treated you
like you weren't gonna succeed?
Well, why would they? I was.
It's a hypothetical, Jason.
Well, I would've been like,
"Back off, haters." Like...
Okay, but that's
a really confident attitude,
and if you were being undermined
your whole life...
Well, I'm confident, so I
wouldn't let them undermine me.
But I'm saying, like,
what if your confidence
isn't actually yours,
it's just something
that you learned how to do
in response to how people
have treated you?
Like, for me-- and I'm not
actually sure
how this happened--
but I feel like, at some point,
I got taught
that other people...
- Dude, pump the brakes, man.
- Uh, my bad. I'm not trying...
No, pump the brakes
on the Humvee.
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.
Nice, nice!
Whew, I thought we were
gonna overshoot it. Nice.
Whew. What were you saying?
Uh, um...
Nothing.

KWAME:

specific?
Just... inspiration.
(chuckles)

- Tough client.
Well, anytime Oscar here senses
a really extreme reaction
from one of the clients,
good or bad,
he starts recording to a disk.
And the full disks
are archived here

Usually, these are

KWAME (recorded):
And that's why you have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

Um...
Um... (coughs, clears throat)

Nah, that, uh,

(quiet knocking)
(old-time jazz music playing)
He was my... second client.
And she was...
Well, I mean, she was Annie.
(camera clicks)
First he fell for her,
then I fell for her,
and then I did my job.
You ever regret it?
Regret is for white people.
I don't think
that's how it works.
Well, not according
to my grandma.
Oh, you're gonna quote
your wise Black grandma to me?
- (laughing)
- To me?
Yeah, but this is my real one.
Okay.
See, my daddy... (sighs)
he used to shine shoes.
And this one day-- I must have
been five, six years old--
I went to town to see him.
And I was running toward him,
all excited.
But before I got to him,
this white man looked down
from the chair above him,
and he just spit on his head.
He spit on him.
He said something about...
my daddy needed
more spit in his shine.
And I just froze.
I mean, my daddy had a temper.
So I'm saying to myself,
"Ooh!
He's about to whoop the shit
out of this white man."
Mm.
But instead, he wiped the spit
off of his head,
and he looked up at him
and he smiled.
And I ran home crying,
thinking about that smile.
When I finally ran into
my grandmother, I told her
how ashamed I was of my daddy,
and she got real still.
And you know what she said?
What?
"If your daddy come home
alive today...
...he ain't got nothing
to regret."
So have I lost some things
to this work?
Some pride?
Her?
Yeah.
But I never regretted
one smile.
Because I'm still here.
And so many of us ain't.
But what do you do about the
little part of you that dies
every time you smile like that?
What, you'd rather go
all at once?
- No, I just...
- It's just pride, Aren.
- Feels like more.
- Well, that's 'cause you didn't
let her go
like I told you to do.
How'd you know that?
(chuckles)
Of course I know
all about that.
I'm pretty much a wizard.
Fair enough.
You'll get another client,
and she will fade.
AREN: Then why do you keep
a picture?
ROGER:
So she doesn't.
That sounds awful.
Well, it's better than
the alternative.
If you do anything to interfere
with her or your client,
you could have
your memory erased.
You won't even remember
she existed.
I'm sorry, son,
but this is the job.

- I'm sorry you heard it wrong.
- I-I was just there. That's...
If what you're saying happened,

Okay, I'm so sorry.
Why are you doing this?
We're friends.
You're not my friend.
And you don't want
to be friends,
because if we were
actual friends,
you would have to talk to me
and listen to me
and make space for the reality
that I live in a country
that makes me feel
like it wants me dead.
- What?
- What?
Where if I get shot today,
there is an army of people
ready to explain how it was
- probably my fault.
- (laughs) Probably?
- And I feel that every day.
- Aren, the diversity section
of this whole thing is coming
later. -In every glance,
in every movie that's
supposed to be uplifting.
- And maybe less about death.
- And that changes everything.
Because death and diversity
don't really have anything
- to do with each other, so...
- That changes how I walk
and how I talk
and how I take up space!
Or don't!
I got this. Okay.
It changes
what risks feel reasonable
and which ones are insane.
And it's taken me my whole life
to realize that this is
a weight
that I walk around with

lifelong journey
