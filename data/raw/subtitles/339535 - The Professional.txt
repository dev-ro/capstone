OCTOBER EVOLUTION
THE PROFESSIONAL
- Roger!
- Hawk! Hawk, come in! Over!
Is there anyone alive?
What shell we do, people? Over!
This is the end, folks!
ONE YEAR LATER...
What are you looking at,
you idiot!
What do you want?
Get out!
Teja, please...
People, go back
to the printing shop!
I'll get the distinguished
manager to the printing shop!
This firm is 150 years old and
he wants to put it out to a...
What was it? - Tender.
- Yes, tender!
He will sell this firm only
over my dead body!
He wants to drive us
out on the street,
to rummage through the trash
cans till the end of our days!
What are we going to
do with the child?
I'm asking you
for the last time.
- I don't want to see the child.
- You don't?
Where to? Where do you
think you're going?
You don't! Eh, you will not,
even if you want to!
The workers are waiting
for you.
They want to go on strike.
It's okey. They haven't had
a strike in 60 years.
If you don't go to the meeting,
they will come here.
To come in through the door and
to go out through the window.
A man is looking for you.
He's looking a bit strange.
You have lipstick all over you
as though you kissed a vampire.
Who is it?
- It seems to me he's not a writer.
He certainly is a writer.
Everybody writes these days
and nobody looks like
a writer anymore.
- What should I tell him?
- Tell him I'm out.
I've already told him so.
He said he knows
that you're out, but that you
should see him anyway.
- He didn't come for his sake.
- For whose sake did he come?
I don't know. He's carrying
a briefcase and a big suitcase.
The lunatics were bringing their
manuscripts in folders till now.
He looks like he arrived
by train a little while ago.
Maybe he is some cousin of yours.
- That's very nice!
He looks strange,
wearing a black suitcase
and he might be my cousin?
- You didn't understand me.
A man could live in this town
for a hundred years
and someone will always tell
him he's a stranger, a peasant.
My grandfather was a peasant and
I loved him more than anyone.
He asked me, if his
old buddy Teja was here.
Let him in,
but call me in five minutes.
Make a lunch reservation
for half past two.
After lunch we're going to
my place, for dessert.
Please, come in.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Sava is a great painter
after all.
If I was a painter,
I would paint just like that.
What can I do for you?
You don't know who I am?
- You don't know me?
- I don't. I'm really sorry...
Can I put the suitcase down?
- Of course. Take a seat.
- No, thank you. I'm in a hurry.
- Are you maybe...
- A friend from the army?
Do you remember your story
"My friend from the army"?
- My story? - Yes. When a man
came to you on the street,
hugged you and asked,
"Do you see some of the boys?"
You were confused,
as you are now, and asked him,
"What boys"?
"Well, the boys from the army."
You felt better, at least you
had some information.
So you said,
"Of course I do."
"And who do you see
most frequently?"
You said,
"I often see Marko Sedlar."
The man looked at you,
lowered his eyes and said,
"I am Marko Sedlar."
An interesting story, but
unfortunately it's not mine.
Yes, it's yours.
You just forgot it.
Excuse me, but who are you?
What's your name?
My name is Luka Laban.
It seems it doesn't ring a bell?
Mister Luka, aren't you by
any chance mistaken?
There are several men
here called Teodor.
But only you're called
Teodor Teja Kraj.
Only you are from Sid
and your mother
is from Sumanovic's family.
Sava is your cousin.
I'm not going to keep
you very long.
I know you have a meeting
with unsatisfied workers.
They don't want their firm to
operate in the private sector.
- To be put out to a...
- Tender. - Yes.
And after the meeting, if you
survive, you're going to lunch
with your secretary and
girlfriend Martha.
- How do you know that?
- Today is your 48th birthday.
It is.
Mister Luka, you had bound those
manuscripts by some book binder?
I didn't dare. My daughter did
that and I wrote the titles.
They often lose or ruin manuscripts?
- Even more.
They sometimes denounce
you to the police,
if something is "especially interesting".
- They do.
The police should work for the
people, not otherwise. - Right.
What are those books about?
This blue book has the title
"Orations". Short and sweet.
- All four books are Orations?
- The green on is a collection
of short stories.
"Stories from the lost home."
The black book is
a collection of urban stories.
Something like
Chekhov's stories.
- You like Chekhov?
- And who doesn't?
Chekhov wrote the story
"Sadness" based on my life.
That book is
particularly interesting.
I see. A large book.
- Pigs are large, and books are voluminous.
You used to tell that to
your students
as a professor of literature. Is that right?
- Yes.
Unbelievable. Splendid.
- Just one question, sir.
- But can I ask you something?
Don't call me "sir", please.
It doesn't suit me well.
I've been a comrade,
Mister Teja, for sixty years.
- All right?
- All right, comrade Luka.
I've told you he has a meeting
and you can't come in.
- No, he has a meeting!
- What's the matter, Martha?
He's yelling at me like
I'm that wife of his...
- Why are you shouting, Jovan?
- She won't let me in,
like you are The President
of the United States!
And how do you think you could
get in without an appointment?
Did you visit the ex-manager
whenever you wanted to?
I did not.
- You've been seeing him once a year.
And now you're bursting in
here, yelling your guts out!
You are late for the meeting.
The workers are waiting.
They've been waiting
for sixty years,
now they can wait
sixty minutes!
But Mister Teja, THIS is
not THAT anymore!
Comrade Jovan, THIS is
really not THAT anymore.
The workers are on strike as
of today. I'm the president
of the striking committee.
- Congratulation!
I'll join you too. I didn't get
my salary in two months.
This is about selling
selling this building.
I know. I'll be there
in ten minutes.
- Don't cry, Martha.
- He's yelling at me!
I didn't even touch her. My wife
doesn't cry when I beat her.
That's it!
Get out of here!
Excuse me, you have
a red spot on your collar.
What's going on here?
Lt'll be just five more minutes.
- Five minutes?
Mister Luka...
Comrade Luka,
the workers are on strike,
I'll have to go down.
No problem,
I'm in a hurry too.
But I'm looking at this
painting. It's like real snow.
One could almost make
a snowball.
Comrade Luka, you're not
a writer by profession? - No.
So, you did all this after
your working hours?
Yes. - Well done.
I've been a writer for 25 years,
and I've written only
two books so far.
I've been working a lot.
My regular job in daytime
and this during the night.
Do you have perhaps more
manuscripts in the suitcase?
No. The suitcase contains lots of stuff.
- What stuff?
Lighters, keys, glasses,
gloves, caps...
Caps? Are there many of them?
- Well, about a dozen or so.
- Do you like caps?
I've never wore them.
As you see, I'm wearing a hat.
I've collected these caps.
And lots of other stuff.
The suitcase is so full,
that I barely closed it.
Comrade Luka,
I'm glad to meet you.
I'm going to read all this
and you can come by
in two or three weeks.
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Why not?
I'm going to have a surgery.
They're scheduling it today.
- Is it something serious?
- No... If I survive.
What should I do with your books?
- They're not my books.
Not yours? - No.
- But whose are they?
Yours.
- What?
- Yours, of course.
- Those are my books?
- Yes. Those are your books.
- Take a look.
- What are you talking about?
Teodor Teja Kraj
ORATIONS
Martha, just five more minutes.
I'm a bit confused here.
Those are my books,
comrade Luka?
Don't laugh, please.
I just thought you're
a serious man
and you're bringing me
my books.
Don't laugh. I'm Luka Laban,
a retired policeman.
A policeman?
- Retired major of the State Security.
You have been "my case"
for ten years.
I've been following you for
ten years, every day.
Those are your Orations, your
stories and your encounters
and discussions while you
were a so called dissident.
I've been following you,
taping you, listening in
to your phone calls
and I've been "taking down"
all this from the tapes.
- And one day...
- What happened one day?
Nothing.
What happened one day?
After October 5th my daughter
asked for your file.
From the file she made
all those books,
before she went to Canada.
Forever.
Your daughter was working
for the police too?
I asked if your daughter was
working for the police.
- Anna is your daughter?
- Yes.
- Your daughter?
- Yes, my daughter.
- You must be joking.
- Why should I?
- Where did you get these from?
- I took them.
Some in the line of duty,
some privately.
- My God, Anna's your daughter.
- She was my daughter.
- What do you mean, "she was"?
- She went to Canada
and got married there. I didn't
see her since, she doesn't call.
Why doesn't she call you?
I wanted to kill you
after October 5th
when you came to power by
force, but she didn't like it.
You wanted to kill me?
- Several times in the line of duty,
but when your people forced
me out of service, privately.
- You're joking.
- No, I never joke.
The workers are calling you to
get down to the printing shop.
They're threatening
with demonstrations.
And that geek told me
to fuck off.
He told me all sort of things.
- The president of the committee?
Now I've had it!
Do you know what he said
to me? That I'm a whore.
- What's the extension?
- 220.
Put the president of
the striking committee on.
Martha, please, don't cry.
Boss, it's for you!
Yes? - What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
I've told you that the people
would go on strike.
We've been waiting
for an hour, sir.
Just tell me did you swore at her!
- Yes, I swore at her.
She told me I was vulgar,
primitive and rude.
If my wife said that to me,
she'd end up in a hospital.
Listen to me, you idiot!
If the workers mess something
up, you'll pay for it!
You're asking for trouble!
I'm not his secretary to fuck
me whenever he wants to!
What's up?
He has a gun.
- Who? The strike's leader?
No, this one here.
Under his jacket.
- What does he want?
- Nothing.
Everything's under control.
Don't worry, Martha.
Comrade Luka,
let's get this straight...
Martha loves you very much.
You know about her husband?
He died of a heart attack two years ago.
- Hi didn't.
He didn't die. He hung himslef.
- Really? - In a nuthouse.
To be exact, he escaped
and hung himself in a park.
I didn't know.
He was sick? Crazy?
Yes. Partly hereditary,
partly because of you.
- Because of me?
- He knew about your affair.
That's why Martha is afraid
of lunatics.
- And how do you know all that?
- It's my job to know everything.
If I'd killed you during
the March demonstrations in '91
as I planed,
that man would be alive.
And maybe he wouldn't. They
say that suicide is destined.
And why did you want
to kill me in '91?
Because you wanted to force
down the Government
and our President. You took
the students out on the streets!
You burned and wrecked Belgrade!
- Who wrecked Belgrade?
You, your friends
and your students!
MARCH 9TH 1991
200.000 DEMONSTRATORS
AGAINST MILOSEVIC
The first time I saw you
in the Security Department.
You covered the whole city
with cameras!
More or less.
Except maybe a few toilets.
Marko, who is this pig?
A professor at the Faculty
of Philosophy, Teodor Kraj.
Students call him Teja.
This platform is free!
- A professor? - Yes.
- Fucking smart ass.
Stop... Zoom in.
You traitorous motherfucker!
You're the one
to bring us freedom!
And this piece of shit
is a professor of what?
- Philosophy, I suppose.
- Philosophy?
I didn't beat
a philosopher before.
I typed your first speech
in my office
and opened your file, that
will turn into these books.
Good evening, Serbia!
Did you manage to get
some sleep?
I've just begun, but I'm going
to need more time.
But I'm satisfied.
What did these days and nights
on the square mean to you?
You've opened my file
with a story about freedom?
What freedom are you
talking about, man?
Read what you've said.
You've insulted
everything and everyone.
Afterward I asked my superior
to let me run you over
with the car. The first time
you get drunk,
I could run you over like a dog.
- Like a dog?
Like a common street dog. But
my superior was a kind man.
He said, "Luka, we should
keep the streets clean."
If your boss approved,
you would really run me over?
You'd be history. You would be
neither the first nor the last.
- There were so many "accidents".
- But why, man?
I was a communist
to the bone in those years.
And you spoke all kinds
of shit about communists.
In your Oration about a monkey
you said about communists,
"Nature needed a million years
to make a man out of a monkey,
but the Communism needed
only fifty years to turn a man
into a monkey again."
- Splendid! I said that?
- And when was that?
- Here... November 15th 1993.
I was selling newspapers that night.
- Really?
I couldn't come to your table
and say, "I'm a policeman.
Let me sit with you and listen
to what are you talking about."
- I don't remember anything.
- Of course. You were dead-drunk.
I say, "What's up, pigs?
What do you want?"
One of them jumps all over me,
hits me with a club in the head.
- In the head!
- Back here.
Hawk, over!
The bastard is in the bar.
I scream from anger and pain,
jump on my feet,
hit one of them, than the other
one, and the other one...
How many fucking cops
were there?
Thirty or forty of them
at least.
Forty against one!
Forty against a poet!
I get upset and yell, "You
evildoers, shame on you!"
And I start to run and jump
through a closed window.
The glass falls all over
the place, I'm flying, falling.
My whole life flashes before
my eyes.
I see my mother, my father,
my brother...
I'm falling, falling...
- How many stories did you fall from?
I don't know,
but it was very high.
Will someone lick this for me?
Fucking fascists!
You're lucky to be alive.
Hawk, roger!
Hawk is entering the bar.
Tomorrow's papers.
Slobodan Milosevic in Nis.
Good evening.
Mister Protic, is it not?
I've recognized you from TV.
Your change, sir...
- No, it's all right.
Let see, where were we?
Liverpool vs. Chelsea...
Paper boy, come over here.
Sit down.
- I can't, sir, I'm busy.
Come on, sit.
How much of that communist
garbage do you have left?
- About 10 copies.
- I'll take it all.
- Stop the music!
- Stop!
- How much is one copy?
- 80 million.
That's eight hundred.
Here, have a billion.
- It's too much, sir.
- No, it isn't.
- It's 200 million too much.
- You're selling nuclear waste.
You'll need money for treatment.
- OK, thank you.
Let's see what
Sloba Nostradamus says.
One raspberry juice, if you have it.
- Of course.
Raspberry juice, man!
I don't drink alcohol
because of my throat.
And how do you feel when
you drink raspberry juice?
I feel good.
- You don't have "epsileptic" seizures?
- What?
- Are you deaf?
Raspberry is known
to attack the hearing!
The man is such an idiot.
Listen to what he's saying:
"Serbia will be one of Europe's
most developed countries
in five years, a role model
for many countries."
God damn it!
This could drive a man crazy!
It's not Sloba's fault.
We are shit!
Nature needed a million years
to make a man out of a monkey,
but the Communism needed
only fifty years to turn a man
into a monkey again.
- A baboon too! Bare-bottomed!
That's right. - Give me a glass
of wine. I'm not feeling well.
Do you think that we drink
because we like to?
Do you see what they say here?
I don't read papers,
I just sell them.
You're poisoning people.
You're a mobile Chernobyl.
Leave the man alone,
he didn't write that shit.
Drug dealers don't make
the drugs, just sell them.
That's right...
That's correct!
Do you know the song
"Government will fall"?
Never heard of it.
"What is that that's falling?
It's the Government and you."
"Many governments have fallen
So yours must fall too..."
Gentlemen, please,
I have five children.
Mister Teja, please don't
sing so loud.
The bar is full of police.
Who is a cop here?
They'll send an inspection,
they'll close my bar.
I have three small children.
I'm saying this because
of your small children!
What will happen if
the Satrap stays in power
for another ten years?
They'll leave this rotten country!
- You'll stay alone like graves!
- Please, they are everywhere.
- My cook is his man.
- My fiddler played for him.
It's not Sloba's fault!
We are shit!
We'll play for you all night,
just don't mention comrade Sloba
All right. Play that old
folk song "Love letter".
That's okey.
Come on! Sing!
Enough! Closing time!
I have to wash my face.
I'm not feeling well.
First I'm going to wash my
face and then hang myself.
I can't stand
this life anymore.
We have to fight, man,
don't kill yourself now!
I wanted to hang you.
I had an excellent alibi,
because you said it yourself
in front of everybody.
I followed you to the bathroom
and I see you taking a piss.
The man looked just like
you from behind.
Boy, you're drunk!
I took off my belt,
made a noose
and put it around your neck
to hang you.
It's okey, Martha,
we're just talking.
He wanted to strangle you.
- He was just explaining something.
Comrade Luka, do you want some coffee?
- Lf it's possible.
Well, it's not possible.
They just arrested the cook.
Teja, he's crazy.
Should I call the police?
No, no... They arrested
Jelena, the cook?
- They're taking her away now.
- Why did they arrest her?
She poured hot coffee into
the doorman's eyes...
- I'll make you coffee.
- No sugar for me, please.
Don't worry.
Everything's under control.
Is it possible that you wanted
to hang me in the bathroom
and make it look
like a suicide?
There were many
questionable suicides.
Dostoevsky wrote about that
when the old Karamazov...
Wait a minute.
You are not a policeman.
You doubt that I'm a policeman?
Is that a compliment?
You don't talk like a policeman.
Your knowledge about Chekov,
Dostoevski, about literature
don't become a policeman.
My dear Mister Teja!
If you only knew how hard
it was for me to comprehend
the basic concepts of that
literary world of yours.
I was convinced that Aristotle,
Kafka, Nietzsche, Hegel
were all agents of foreign
intelligence services.
I even came across similar
names in police files
of embassies employees.
When you quoted Sartre,
I was sure he was the
French military attaché.
His name was also Jean-Paul,
only he wasn't a philosopher.
So I added in his file:
"And a philosopher".
What could I do?
Of all foreign names
I've heard only of
Marx, Engels and Lenin.
You still doubt that
I'm telling the truth?
Well...
And how's your leg?
- What leg? - The left one.
You had severe fracture of the thighbone.
- Yes.
And two surgeries.
The leg is 4 cm shorter, your
right shoe sole 4 cm thicker.
At first sight one can't see
you have a limp.
I quit smoking, I had three
by-passes. I carry the lighter
out of the habit.
Keep it, it's yours anyway.
- How do you know about my leg?
- I know. I hit you with my car.
You hit me with your car?
And you got off easy.
If I'd been driving a jeep,
it would've taken them three
days to put you together.
You are a monster! A murderer!
- I didn't kill anyone.
- I spent a year in a hospital!
I had four surgeries!
Not two, four!
They've barely managed
to save my leg!
Look what you did to me,
you filthy cop! Take a look!
And here is what you did
to me, you mangy pig!
Martha! Martha!
- What are you doing?
- We're talking.
Why are you taking off
your clothes?
I'm showing him my scar
from the surgery.
- And he's showing me his.
- Why do you do that?
What do you want?
Martha, everything's
going to be fine.
I'll finish this conversation
in five minutes.
- You know how much I love you?
- I know. But who is that man?
I'll tell you all about it
at lunch. Kiss you.
- Five minutes?
- Five.
Jovan, come here!
Hurry up!
- What's up?
- He's a pervert!
I couldn't believe my eyes...
She was lying like this...
Boss...
People, do you see
this circus?
Believe me, If I had a gun,
I would kill you.
Take mine.
The bullet is in the hole,
just squeeze the trigger.
You know I can call the Chief
of The State Security now.
So? - You'd spent the rest
of your life in prison.
Prison is for people. I've sent
at least a hundred men there.
Most of them are now in power
because they served time.
And you were given some
position after being run over.
I did you a favor
and you want to kill me.
- It's not right.
- You're not normal.
Cheers.
Is it possible that you wanted
to kill me because of Milosevic?
Partly because of him,
but more because of Knin.
Because of Knin?
I ran you over the second day
after Knin fell.
I was in shock,
I wanted to kill all of you!
August 1995
Exodus of Serbs from Croatia
Milan, why don't you let these
poor people into the city?
What do you think, who can forbid?
- Who has forbidden?
- The President, they say.
- The President?
Where are the people
supposed to go?
- The order is, to Kosovo.
- To Kosovo?
And where from Kosovo if
a war breaks out down there?
How am I suppose to know, Luka?
Boss, that professor
and some of his men
are organizing a rally.
- That's forbidden.
Yes, but they are gathering
in the Hall of Sports.
They expect over twenty
thousand people to come.
They're plotting to go to
the President's house.
- They're mentioning guns too.
- Guns?
And the "Rumanian scenario."
As though this misery is not
enough for them,
they want blood
in Belgrade too.
Well, I'm going to show them
the "Serbian scenario"!
A million people should
have been on the streets
of Belgrade tonight!
The processions of wretches
are passing by our houses!
500.000 men, women and children
are looking at our windows.
They're not allowed to go into
the Milosevic's Imperial City!
That's right.
- What else must happen to us...
How many of our people are there?
- More than a half.
I'm going to take down
this professor tonight.
...and if he sleeps,
what is he dreaming about?
Does he dream about so many
wounded and dead people?
Shame on us before
Nikola Tesla,
who's looking at us
and asking,
"Where is my native soil,
brothers?"
Milosevic is not to blame!
We're to blame, we're shit!
He knows that we're shit!
When he gets tired of us,
he just flushes, and shit
goes down the toilet!
Who is shit,
you motherfucker?!
Easy.
Here, calm down.
Those bastards broke my leg.
Let go of me.
- I'm going to kill him!
- Come on!
- Let go of me!
- All right!
Teja...
Teja, damn it!
Teja, damn it!
You bastards!
- Do you have a fever?
- Leave the man alone.
What do you mean?
He was lucky.
They put my healthy leg
in the cast first.
Later they got it right and
now it's OK, thank God.
I said, let's go to the bar!
Politics will kill us.
- Nice shirt.
- What was that?
- I said, nice shirt.
- He said you have a nice shirt.
My uncle gave it to me.
Good evening, gentlemen.
How are you?
- Good evening, doctor.
- How are you, mister Kraj?
Gentlemen, you must leave.
Visiting hours are over.
No problem, doctor.
What happened, young man?
Soccer?
- Yes, but soccer with clubs.
- Very nice.
Hang on, Teja! Everything's
going to be all right.
- You're a big hero!
- Let's go.
Mister Kraj, excellent!
No fever, as I see.
- No constipation, excellent!
- What's excellent, doctor?
You were in critical condition
last night.
- We thought that we lost you.
- You thought I'll die?
Well, it was a close shave.
A splendid diagnosis:
A close shave.
Nurse, put it here.
Do they know who hit me?
They'll find out. Papers say,
the investigation is underway.
The investigation is underway
and the funeral is tomorrow.
You must have fate
in our police department.
I'm afraid that investigation
is being led by those,
who run me over.
Who is paying you to hate
our President so much?
Who is paying me?
I mean, who is your
contact abroad?
You can tell me.
I'm under a doctor's oath.
I fear that someone
might hear us.
We're alone.
You can whisper it to me.
- This is a plastic ear.
- You're joking.
Unbelievable. It looks real.
No one would think
it was plastic.
And who'd think you have one shorter leg?
- True.
This would also be aggravated
assault and battery in court.
Let's part with a drink.
The workers are waiting for me.
- Cheers, comrade Luka.
- Cheers, Mister Teja.
- What are those?
- Your things.
My things? - Like those are your
books, these are your things.
- What do you think?
- Where did you get all this?
I collected them while I've been
following you for ten years.
You kept loosing your stuff
in bars, clubs and trains.
When you get drunk, you loose things.
- I know.
I have two light coats, three
coats, one leather jacket,
gloves, scarves, umbrellas at
home. I couldn't bring it all.
There, it is my present
for your birthday. Cheers.
My God.
Yes? - We're going out on the street.
We'll stop the traffic.
- I'll be there in five minutes.
- We can't wait anymore!
You're fucking around upstairs
and we're working like slaves!
Don't do anything stupid!
I'm on my way!
We won't rest until
we see your back!
And when you see my back,
you can kiss my ass!
Those who go out in the street,
will stay in the street!
A whole life in a suitcase?
Where did I get this binoculars?
You don't remember? It was
a present from my daughter.
- From Anna?
- On New Year's Eve 1997.
During those big demonstrations,
when you thought you had won.
You were celebrating
the New Year and victory.
You were still a professor, my
daughter was on the first year.
And, of course, she fell in love
with a professor.
When they told me that,
I almost died.
Roger!
Come on, hurry up!
Where have you been?
Let me check you out...
You all have communicators?
Where is Marko?
- He's waiting for you in your office.
You wait for me in the garage.
I'll be right there.
What's going on here? Why is
he screaming like a mule?
Get ready.
We're going to celebrate.
I'll explain it to you.
- What's your name?
- Jovan Mandic.
Did I ask you?
Shut the fuck up.
- What's your name?
- Jovan Mandic.
So you're the famous Joca.
And why are these good
people beating you?
Why are you laughing...?
Why are they beating you?
I switched off the electricity
in the center of the city.
Why?
- It's more beautiful with the candles.
You like candles? Now we're
going to light you a candle.
Leave him for five minutes,
then continue.
- With the treatment?
- Yes.
What are you waiting for?
Do your people have to beat
a man on New Year's Eve too?
Cut the crap. Let's go.
I'm not working here as of
tonight. It's not for me.
And one more thing. I wasn't
going to tell you that. - What?
Your daughter is with
the professor, in the city.
My daughter is with that
lunatic in the city?
Yes. I saw them.
- My daughter is dating that idiot?
Yes. They are going to
a New Year's Eve party later.
I'll kill him.
December 31 st 1996
Demonstrations on New Year's Eve
- Where have you been?
- Beat it!
Are you our Santa?
Did you bring the presents?
What Santa! What presents!
- Roger! Roger!
- Please, come in.
Are you crazy? I'm expecting
Santa Claus and presents
and you send me strippers
and the police!
Hawk, come in! Over!
The doctor said you
should retire now.
I know. He told me too.
He said you wouldn't
survive the next heart attack.
Who cares?
- What are you talking about, Dad?
You know very well.
Don't upset me.
Do you want me to die here
in front of you?
That man... I'm going to...
- What? Tell me.
- Nothing.
What's with the visa?
Did you get the visa
for Canada?
- How do you know about that?
- My job is to know everything.
- When do you leave?
- I don't know.
Promise me something.
- What?
- You know what.
Take care.
I'll see you tomorrow.
God, what did I do
to deserve this?
I promised Anna
I wouldn't kill you.
As you see, I've kept my
promise. You're alive and well.
So, Anna saved my life?
Your life and everything
you've lost in your life.
She never told me her father
was a policeman.
She was probably embarrassed.
When I got out of hospital
I followed you around and
took these pictures to the Dean.
They were just waiting for
some excuse to throw you out.
I got hooked up on booze
hanging out with you artist.
So you set me up with a story
of "seducing female students
and orgies in my office".
Yes, me.
Why are you complaining?
You've been on all the front
pages for two months.
Your daughter ended up in
a hospital after a breakdown
and she left her studies.
- Yes. But she also left you.
- I could kill you right now!
- You'd be killing a dead man
and they'd convict you
as though I was alive.
- No!
- I'll kill him, Martha.
- It will do you no good.
- You ruined my life!
And what have you done to me?
The workers are on the street.
They stopped the traffic.
Demonstrations again? Why now,
when we have democracy?
Comrade Luka,
I might kill you.
- Type Jovan's resignation. Now!
- The Minister's office
wants to know what's going on.
- I will tell them!
Bringing down the Government
is going on!
I'm the opposition now.
Although a bit drunk.
They're not bringing me down,
they're bringing you down!
Send the police
to regulate the traffic.
- What's that?
- Letters from your mother.
- Letters from my mother?
- Yes, ten letters.
Where did you get
these letters?
When you lost your job,
you had no money.
You were moving from one
apartment to another
and I collected your mail,
saying I was your cousin.
- You are a monster.
- A was just a professional.
My dear son Teja,
you promised to come
in November for your
father's birthday,
and now New Year has passed
and you still didn't come.
Some of my letters come back,
so it seems to me
that I've been writing them
to myself.
- You're writing to Teja?
- What else can I do?
Tell him I said hallo.
And give him this ring.
- Read me the letter.
- Don't torture me.
I received the medications
you've sent.
The truth is, I'm not taking any
medications for a long time.
I asked for them hoping
you'll bring them yourself.
I'm sending you these gloves
with Luka,
your father's friend from
the police school.
Luka is the only one
who visits him regularly.
My vision is getting weaker
lately, so if you write to me,
bring the letter yourself,
so you can read it to me.
With love, your mother.
- You were visiting my house?
- Yes.
You went to the police school
with my father?
No. I only wanted to see
what was your family like.
- And what did you see?
- All the best.
A decent mother
and an honest father,
who went ill and died
because of you.
Your father was brought to
Belgrade to break up
the demonstrations you've
been organizing yourself.
Come on, don't cry.
You know about my son
and my ex-wife?
Of course. I know everything.
MARCH, APRIL, MAY,
JUNE 1999
NATO OPERATION
"THE MERCIFUL ANGEL"
- Good evening.
- Same to you.
The piggies were so afraid.
After he blew down
the straw house and
the wooden house,
he went towards the brick
house. And he shouted,
"When I blow and spit fire
I'll tear your house down."
And he started blowing!
And the tiles began to fly from
the roof of the brick house.
Does the wolf work
for NATO?
My son...
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see him.
Come on,
take a look at him.
He has a name, you know.
His name is not "him".
Come on,
now you bomb me too.
Look what Daddy
brought you. A toy-puppy.
Did you see him?
We have a dog.
A real dog.
- What's her name?
- Honey-pie.
And you can give that to
this girlfriend of yours.
- Where did you get this?
- A man gave it to me.
- I want to take it home.
- No.
I want to take it home!
Why are you like that?
She said,
"We have a real dog."
"Take this one away. We don't
need anything from you."
In those words?
My son barely recognized me!
Teja, my friend!
Don't do that.
It is because of the bombing.
The posttraumatic stress.
It'll all pass when
the bombing is over.
There are so many nice things
in life. We all love you.
- Just those Americans don't.
- And British.
Then she gave me this picture
of me and some student of mine.
Was it that girl?
- Don't joke with me!
Someone is giving these
pictures around.
It will be all over
the papers tomorrow.
We'll be in the papers!
Great!
Motherfuckers!
What are these evil men
doing to us!
- What's up, boys?
- What do you want, faggot?
- Do I have to come there?
- What the hell do you want?
You misunderstood me.
I meant,
what do you want
to drink with us?
- Let's go.
- Have a drink with us.
I mean, I'm an invalid.
And he's completely healthy.
Who is that pretty woman?
Martha. She comes here
every Sunday.
Fuck you, you bastards!
You and your fucking planes!
God damn you,
you monsters!
It's no use.
They are too high up.
What do you want?
- And what are you doing with the ledder?
I can stand where ever I want
in my office. Why are you here?
To give the manager our demands.
If he doesn't meet our demands
in half an hour,
we're moving downtown.
We're going to block
the whole city!
The manager has
an important meeting.
This is more important for
him! His life is at stake!
If he doesn't agree to this, he
better jump through the window!
And you could too, while you're
already standing on the ladder.
Martha, honey, come here...
I'll gladly do time for this.
- Comrade Luka...
- What are you doing, Jovan?
I only wanted...
- You only wanted to kill the manager.
I wanted to scare him. He hit me.
- Come here.
Postpone the demonstrations
for a week.
- You're still in the service?
- You dare to ask me that?
But they told me
that you are...
- Who's giving you orders?
- You are.
Dismiss your people. Tell them
the negotiations are in progress.
- Did he hit you?
- No.
- Are you hurt?
- No.
- Are you in pain?
- No.
Come on, lie down.
We could say that
you saved my life.
I'm not sure that he would shoot.
- He would. He's crazy.
- He's one of ours.
- He's working for the police?
Yes. A collaborator.
- You were his boss?
- Yes.
How come he's working
for the police now,
when the police is changed?
- Who says it's changed?
Me and your late father are
the only ones who're changed.
- This was a planned rebellion?
- Guided by remote control.
He organizes riots where
they're needed.
And why were they needed
here now?
I don't know. I'm not
in the service anymore.
I used to move him
from firm to firm.
He's the greatest agitator.
In the Department
we call him "Trotsky".
Take a sip,
you'll feel better.
In any case, thank you.
Can I ask you something?
If he did kill my by any
chance, would he be accused?
- For what?
- For murder.
- Well, it wouldn't be a murder.
- And what would it be?
Probably a suicide.
- I would shoot myself?
- Yes, you would commit suicide.
But Martha was present.
She would testify.
- How could a dead woman testify?
- He would kill her too?
No, you would kill Martha
and then commit suicide.
I would kill Martha and
then commit suicide?
Yes. Newspapers are full
of tragic love stories.
You loved her,
she betrayed you,
you killed her and then
committed suicide.
Jovan would probably be
the witness to your tragedy.
And you? - What about me?
- You were present too.
Two dead people would
testify that I was present?
God.
I don't know if I saved your
life today, but once I did.
I saved you in the last moment.
You were clinically dead.
- When was that?
- When your father died.
You saved my life
when my father died?
Is it possible that you don't
remember that either?
I don't remember.
What?
Mister Kraj,
just one more question.
Do you mind, colleague?
Is it true that you are related
to our great painter?
Yes, on my mother's side.
Have you inherited anything
from your great cousin?
A couple of paintings.
- I meant... - The talent?
- No chance!
Sava Sumanovic spent a long
time in psychiatric hospital.
You think illnesses are
hereditary?
I didn't say that.
Oh my great plain
You won't let me sleep
And even in my dreams
For you I weep
Everything is flat
Not a thing in sight
And the sky...
What's up?
- My neck!
- Not again, man!
- Mister Kraj, excuse me.
- Yes?
Your father...
My condolences.
Please, I'm begging you now.
Stay out of politics.
He was killed by politics.
Promise me you'll stick
to your own affairs.
I promise. As soon as
this regime changes.
- And when will that be?
- After the elections.
In which year?
He left you this.
Tamburitza orchestra,
even here?
This is his song. They've
played it to him his whole life.
If he didn't want a requiem,
let his musicians play for him.
This was my father's song.
When he was drunk,
he used to ask for this song.
One time he gave this ring
to make them play this song
all night long. Sixty times!
- Sixty times!
- Sixty times!
Did they take out
bullets from your meet?
What bullets and buckshot?
For every pound of meat
you get a pound of led.
- What meat is this?
- Deer. It's a deerburger.
You ate a deer's child.
You ate Bamby, you fat cow.
Little Bamby!
I've heard about your father.
My deepest regrets.
Hunters, sit down.
Come on, sit down.
- What happened to your head?
- This idiot almost killed me.
- Why are you looking at me?
- It was an accident.
Do I look like a rabbit to you?
- Do I look like a rabbit?
- Not at all.
You want some carrots
and cabbage?
Why are you looking at me?
Here, take a gun, shoot me and we're even.
- Enough, you two!
What is the range
of those snipers?
It depends on the hunter.
A good hunter can kill from
two thousand meters.
Excellent!
I have an excellent idea.
If Milosevic robs
the elections again,
as he's been doing so far,
we'll organize a hunt on him.
Now sing my song.
"Government will fall".
- Please, don't ask that.
- "Government will fall"!
If the Government falls,
the head falls too.
Is this enough?
We'll try.
Gentlemen, now you will
hear a real song!
I'm on your trail for years
With an arrow in my hands
Now I see you, now I don't
Your shadow is white and bends
But one night, oh my dear
I'll be able to grab it
I will meet you fair and square
I will kill you like a rabbit
A shooting star is falling
And also hawk, a bird so gray
A smile on my face is rolling
And the snow on Christmas Day
A man can fall from drinking
And the soul can fall asleep
At down the night is sinking
Falling, falling deep
What is that that's falling
It's the Government and you
Many governments have fallen
So yours must fall too...
Sit down and have a drink.
Put those lights out.
- What's up?
- Your tickets, please.
Every five minutes someone
asks for the tickets.
What is this?
A train or a casino.
- Sit down.
- Have a drink.
I shouldn't. I'm on duty.
Don't play innocent with us!
We are all on duty.
We have a duty to pay back
our debts.
You look familiar to me.
You too.
Are you on your way home?
I've been a conductor on this
route for 25 years.
What do you have
in those packages?
Oh, would you like to know?
The posters for the elections.
We'll cover whole Belgrade.
Who are you gonna vote for?
- Same as you. - Bravo, sir!
He's our man!
I have a cold.
- When Sloba falls, I'll get even more fat.
No I'm somehow maintaining
my weight because I'm upset.
You can give me one package.
I'll cover the whole train.
It would be great advertising.
Trains travel everywhere.
It's a great idea!
He is our PR!
Our propagandist!
- You're in a wrong line of work.
- Cheers. Here's to our victory.
- To victory!
I'm not feeling well.
I'm sick. I'll die.
It's occupied!
Hey, look, Teja fell off!
- Who fell off?
- Teja.
Look how he fell!
Hey, Teja!
- We'll be waiting for you in the bar!
Look at this!
Get up, Teja!
You're heavy as a rock.
- Why did you save me?
- Lf I had left you,
my daughter would think
that I'd killed you.
My father's ring!
Don't wear it in a bar. If you
give it to musicians again,
there will be no one
to return it to you.
Thank you.
Why are you looking through
the window all the time?
I'm afraid they might
take away my cab.
A cab has been waiting
for you all this time?
- It's my cab. I'm a cab driver.
- You?
It's called
"a change of government".
I was the boss while
you were a vagabond.
Now you are a manager
and I'm a cab driver,
which is almost the same
as a vagabond.
How can you drive a cab when you're sick?
- I have no choice.
Do you think I could buy
medications with my pension?
Three o'clock!
The doctor will kill me.
I'm late and I'm drunk.
There's a play of yours
in this briefcase.
It could be performed in
a theatre or made into a movie.
Don't make a fool of me.
I never wrote a play.
- Yes, you did.
- When? - Just now.
I've turned it on before
I came into this office.
It has recorded everything
we've said.
You just need to write down
the story from the tape.
If Anna was here, she would
do it, but now you have to.
You must be
a professional for once.
Comrade Luka, can I help you in some way?
- No.
- Actually, you could.
- Just tell me.
This is Anna's number
in Canada.
Tell her that I've brought
you the books and your things.
And don't mention my illness,
please. She has her own worries.
And... tell her that
we've parted...
...in peace.
I wish you all the best,
Martha
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Sava is a great painter
after all.
If I was a painter,
I would paint just like that.
What can I do for you?
You don't know who I am?
- I don't. I'm really sorry...
Can I put the suitcase down?
- Of course. Sit down.
- No, thank you. I'm in a hurry.
- Are you maybe...
- A friend from the army?
Do you remember your story
"My friend from the army"?
My story? - Yes. When a man
came to you on the street,
hugged you and asked,
"Do you see some of the boys?"
You asked him, "What boys"?
"Well, the boys from the army."
You felt better, at least you
had some information.
So you said,
"Of course I do."
"And who do you see
most frequently?"
You said, "I often see
Marko Sedlar."
The man looked at you,
lowered his eyes and said,
"I am Marko Sedlar."
An interesting story, but
unfortunately it's not mine.
Yes, it's yours.
You just forgot it.
Excuse me, but who are you?
What's your name?
My name is Luka Laban.
