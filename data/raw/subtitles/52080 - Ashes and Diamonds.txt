Listen, tell me again,
who is this guy?
Szczuka.
Who is he?
Secretary of the
District Workers' Party.
Mister ...
Scram, kid.
Mister, could you open the
chapel door for me, please?
See?
It's locked.
Get out of here.
What's wrong?
They're coming.
Don't worry,
I've waited around
for more
important things.
Hurry up!
Ants, damn it!
Get out of here!
Come on! Go!
Quickly,
they're coming!
The car's
approaching!
All right,
get his documents!
He doesn't have any!
Jesus and Mary!
Let's get out of here.
Stop! Wait!
The machine gun!
Wait!
What happened?
Two of our men
were killed.
Smolarski,from
the cement plant,
a board member
of the congregation.
And the other one?
Also from the
cement plant.
Gawlik,a young kid,
not even twenty years old.
He returned, from
forced labor in Germany,
a week ago.
He came back for death.
I think they meant to kill us
instead of these two.
You really think so?
Of course.
But it's not important.
Excuse me, comrade...
My name is Szczuka.
So you're the Party Secretary
who was coming here?
That's right
I wanted to ask you something.
Not just I, but all of us.
Tell me, how long will people
be dying like this?
They weren't first!
And not the last.
Does that scare you?
Everyone wants to live.
Haven't enough of us died
these past years?
Do you know that Smolarski
lost two sons?
Both were shot by Germans,
one in 1939, the other in 1943.
And now, he lies
there, too.
What for?
Who shot him?
Poles?
Tell us!
How long will this last?
I would be a bad
communist, comrades,
if I were to assure you, like
a bunch of naive kids.
The end of the war,is not
the end of the battle.
The battle forwhat Poland
should be like, has just begun.
And today, tomorrow,
orthe day after,
anyone of us could die.
All right.
We understand.
But what do we
tell his wife?
What should we
tell her?
It's hard for me
to talk about this,
since I knew those bullets
were meant for me.
Keep your heads up. You have
to do everything you can
while you still live.
That's what's important.
This is
a special announcement.
Today, the 8th of May,
in the ruins of Berlin,
the German High Command
has agreed
to the unconditional
surrender of Germany.
So where is he?
He should have
been here by now.
Where does he
get his information?
From his boss.
And who's that?
The Mayor.
That idiot is his secretary.
So he works for both sides?
I hate that.
Do we know if
he can be trusted?
Can anyone be trusted?
Hey look at that.
Nice tank.
The Polish tanks
are ready to fight.
Look, here he comes.
Look.
Look!
Greetings, gentlemen.
You're late.
Any complications?
No, I had to change.
You getting married?
No, not at all. I'm in
charge of the banquet.
Give me the bag.
I can't see well,
it's too bright.
Listen, Andrzej, don't ask me
forthis type of stuff anymore.
Sure, don't
worry about it.
Well, information, yes,
but not this...
Stop bothering me.
Maciek!
What?
Let's go.
Where are you going?
We've been invited
to the banquet.
You're joking...
don't worry,
I know what I'm doing.
But why risk everything?
Don't bother me!
See ya.
Bye.
Well! Look who's here!
What bring
you here?
My duties, sir.
Of course, I understand,
the banquet.
You're looking
forthe director, right?
He's in there,
arranging the banquet.
And this!
A masterpiece!
Take it from me.
How are you?
I hope
the mayorwill be pleased.
Yes, the mayor is very
anxious about this dinner.
I understand.
It's the end of the war.
A very important moment.
A separate entrance to the
bathroom. Very covenient.
How is everything?
Thank you, director,
everythings quiet.
Looks pretty good.
I guarantee you, sir, that it'll
look even betterwhen you eat.
Come on, let's go.
Wait. Did you see
the pretty girl?
She's all right.
Lets have a drink.
Good evening, Miss.
Would you be kind enough
to get us some drinks?
What will you have?
How about two vodkas.
Miss Krystyna.
What is it,
Mr. Editor?
That's a beautiful
name, Krystyna.
Stop fooling around.
I'm not
fooling around.
Drink your vodka,
and lets go.
This should
coverthe bill.
this is a very
nice bar, isn't it?
What time are you open till?
Until three.
Do you like violets?
Very much so!
Me too!
-Did you see that?
-What?
They looked almost like Warsaw girls.
Makes me not want to leave.
Than stay.
That's easy foryou to say.
As far as I know, no one is waiting foryou...
Since no one is waiting for me, there's no reason to stay.
I don't get it.
Really?
That's probably the master.
Here, let me take this...
Hello? Yes, this is Mrs Staniewicz.
Let me transferyou.
Major?
Yes?
There's a call foryou.
Hello? Hello?
This is Andrzej speaking. Andrzej.
I wanted to inform you that it's been taken care of.
Everything's okay. Yes. Yes.
No complications. Yes. Yes.
Good Morning.
Do you have a room for Comrade Szczuka?
The Town Committee called in a reservation.
Of course, everythings taken care of.
Room number 18 on the first floor.
At your service.
Yes. Yes. Hold on.
Hello? Did you go for a walk or something?
Hold on, I don't understand. So, you've failed...
Yes... I understand now. That's to bad.
Come here at once.
Thank you.
Do you have any cigarettes?
American, Hungarian...
American will do.
At your service.
Thank you. Here you go.
Thank you.
Wait for me outside.
Alright, but I've waited for more exciting things...
Do you know the Staniewicz family?
Of course, sir, of course.
Do they still live in the same place as before the war?
Yes, yes. It's not farfrom here.
They have a telephone, should I call them foryou?
Here, allow me.
Thank you.
Here's their number. 12-14.
At your service. And the key.
What time is this banquet at? At eleven?
Yes, the carwill wait for us.
Can I help you sir?
I'd like one pack of cigarettes.
American or Hungarian?
Hungarian. They're stronger.
Let me get you your change.
Keep it. Will you have one with me?
No, thank you.
They're too strong for me, you know, my age...
Your age? How old are you?
Sixty.
You don't look anything over 50.
That's very kind of you, sir. Are you here alone?
For now.
A blonde?
Maybe...
I'm not sure if I can find you a double room...
That's okay, I don't mind a single room.
The more cramped, the better.
Are you by a chance, from Warsaw?
Of course.
So am I. I used to work at the Savoy Hotel.
On Nowy Swiat Street.
Yes. I missed the 25-year mark at the hotel by 2 months.
Almost a lifetime.
So you were there forthe Uprising...
Yes of course, downtown until the last day.
How about you?
Here and there. First I was in the Old Town, and then downtown.
You know, without Warsaw, things just aren't the same.
It's like losing an arm.
The chestnuts would be blooming
at about this time in the boulevards and parks.
Blooming you say? Blooming...
You know, I was going to give you a room on the third floor,
but the place is full of bugs.
Here, why don't you take room 17 on the first floor.
You deserve it. We Warsovians have to stick together.
Do you have any luggage?
Just this.
Not much.
I've had less.
Here are my papers.
Maciej Chelmicki.
That's right.
Born in Warsaw in 1921.
Occupation... Worker?
Nah, only to fool the Germans.
I'm actually a student.
Thank you.
What are you bawling about?
Did something happen in the kitchen?
They're jealous of you! Well?
They killed Stasiek! The bastards shot him!
Who's Stasiek? Who shot him?
My fiancee, Stasiek Gawlik.
Why would they want to kill him?
How am I supposed to know?
It's probably not true.
Not true? Jeziorek was just over.
The cop?
He probably just wanted some vodka, and got it all wrong...
There's no mistake...
He said two people from the cement plant were shot.
I got a bad feeling and asked who they had shot.
He said Smolarski and Stasiek Gawlik.
God, I thought I was going to die right there.
I had a feeling.
They supposedly wanted to kill someone else,
and this was a mistake.
Drink. It's too bad, but you can't undo it.
And stop crying. Here, I'll give you some stockings.
Oh, you pretend to be good, but I see what you really want!
It seems that innocent people were killed.
An attack of conscience.
You believe it's out of place, Major?
Do you know who was killed?
Some workers from the cement factory.
The situation is very clear.
There was a mistake, and it must be corrected.
Major, I have a question.
Yes?
Is it really necessary to kill Szczuka?
Lieutenant, you're an experienced soldier,
and you should know, that as your superior officer,
I don't need to answeryour question.
I think...
I don't care what you think. I'm waiting foryour anwer.
Yes.
I'm glad we agree on this, then.
But, I'll answeryou anyway.
I understand your doubts, and I would be very surprised
if you didn't have any.
This situation is very complicated,
but the waryears have taught us that we must approach
these complicated situations unequivocally.
No compromise, one way orthe other.
How long have you been in the resistance?
Since 1940.
And what did you fight for? For Poland's freedom?
But is this the Poland that you imagined foryourself?
Lieutenant, you have to know that the only option
left to you in a Poland such as this, is to fight.
Where will you go with your past history?
Everything in this country is now off-limits to you,
except for one thing. Prison.
I know.
Now, about this man who's been giving us trouble.
Who is Szczuka?
An intellectual, an engineer, a communist,
and a great organizer. A man who knows what he wants.
After several years in Russia, he's come back,
and now he's on the People's party Committee.
You must realize, Lieutenant,
the power he will have as First Secretary.
Wiping out such a man would make a powerful impression.
It would have, both, political and propaganda significance.
Especially since ourforces are beginning to lose ground.
I got a report today that captain Wilk's group
was surrounded by the army and the security police.
They suffered great losses,
and only a few managed to get out alive.
That's very unfortunate, but if I know captain Wilk,
he'll find a way out.
Unfortunately, the Captain was killed.
I have to admit, that in the Colonel's house,
It's easy to forget all the ugliness outside.
I'm very happy, Count.
Please, no titles tonight.
So how's business?
Everything's coming along nicely.
Are you sure about that, my dear?
I see you've forgotten that nothing is sure these days.
Don't worry. Ourfriends will remain ourfriends.
Then we place ourfate in your hands.
You must mean my husband's hands.
He's going to use all he can
to get us out of this country as soon as possible.
Then I propose... and it's getting late...
that we drink to the Colonel's health, at the Monopol.
Mr. Szczuka has arrived, Madam.
Who did you say?
Mr. Szczuka.
Please, accept my apologies,
but I'll have to leave you all here for a minute.
I have to attend to some really boring business...
I know what you mean, my dear.
Business is always so boring.
And it's getting harderto live without it...
How are you Katarzyna?
You recognize me, don't you?
What do you want?
You know that last month I returned from Russia.
I know. I got your letter.
I've sent three.
I didn't have anything new to tell you. I still don't.
Listen, Katarzyna, at the end of 1941,
I got word from my friends that Maria had died,
and that you had taken Marek.
Did you want me to give him up to an orphanage?
I wrote you that I didn't want Marek to be raised by you,
and that he was to go to my friends' house.
Did you get that letter?
No, I didn't get it.
But even if I had, Marek would still have stayed with us.
You seem to forget, that in spite of everything,
Maria was my sister.
Where is he?
I don't know.
I wrote you that the last time I saw him was in October.
at the apartment, afterthe Uprising.
And you haven't gotten any news of him since?
No.
So this is all that you can tell me about my son?
Listen, Katarzyna, he's seventeen years old.
I know. These days, seventeen year old boys are grown men.
What kind of man did you raise him to be?
A good Pole, don't you worry...
I can imagine yourtype of patriotism.
It's not difficult to guess how you brought him up.
Too bad, it's done, now.
But he's only seventeen, and if he's alive,
sooner or later, he'll be my son again.
Don't worry, it wasn't important.
Hold on, Lieutenant. This apartment isn't safe anymore.
Are you in a hurry?
No, I'm meeting someone.
Awoman?
Disappointed?
Who?
You.
Me? Why would I care about who you're meeting.
You don't care about anything.
I sure hope not.
I don't believe you.
You don't have to if you don't want to.
Then I wont. How long are you here for?
Until we close.
You're all alone forthe whole night?
Another girl comes in at ten.
Can you leave early?
No, when it get's busy,
we barely get by with only two of us.
There's the woman you're meeting.
Yes, I see you remember him.
Of course, he's very handsome.
-Come with me.
-What did he say?
Come with me. Let's sit in the other room.
What did he say?
Are you crazy? It's pretty quiet in here.
What you don't like this table?
It's like a dream come true.
Is it that bad?
He's coming. Are you leaving?
You crazy?
You wanted to go to Warsaw.
What happened? Did he call it off?
On the contrary.
Come on, who do you take me for?
Have I ever run away from work?
Guess who lives in room 17 of the wonderful Monopol Hotel,
right next doorto a certain someone else?
Alright, Maciek.
Who's that idiot, for God's sake?
Who?
That guy!
He's got a stupid looking back.
He looks like an idiot from the front, too.
Good evening.
Good evening, sir.
will you be having vodka with vermouth, as usual?
No, today is an exception, cognac.
Did you close a deal, today?
Yes, very artistic.
Thank you.
And how is your show doing?
Splendid.
Right this way, Count...
Today, we are celebrating a great day.
The war has ended.
Who else could top that,
if not the incomparable Hanka Lewicka!
Do you remember?
What?
Drink's at Red's
No.
You don't remember?
When was it?
So you do remember...
Stop fooling around.
No?
I don't remember.
No?
Haneczka. Wilga. Kossobudzki. Red.
Kajtek.
But we're alive.
Those were the times, weren't they, Andrzej?
You really think so?
What a life... and in such company...
Such a great crowd.
So what? Almost all of them died.
But life was good!
We were different.
Younger.
We knew what we wanted.
Sure.
We knew what they wanted from us.
You've discovered the truth!
What else could they have wanted from us?
For us to die! And they still want it!
Okay, then! We can afford to!
Stop overacting! It's not difficult to die.
It depends on how!
That's all we're capable of doing.
Is it not enough?
It's definitely not much.
You're exaggerating.
You're exaggerating, Andrzej.
Why take everything so seriously?
The best thing is to force yourself through this life.
Don't let yourself be tricked. Don't be bored.
What else is there?
Perhaps, you're right.
Listen, Maciek, we have to talk seriously.
God, these brutes make such noise!
What will you do with ourfriend?
Don't worry, I'll manage.
Listen, I'm responsible to the Major.
That's all right, I'm responsible to you.
Everyone's responsible to someone else.
And there's another complication.
Don't worry, the orderwill be carried out.
What's the complication?
First of all, the major doesn't want me involved in this.
And anyway, I have to leave this place. Fast.
This is completely new to me.
I'm going to take Wilks place.
Why, What's wrong with him?
I'm taking his place.
All right, next.
You recently told me that nobody is waiting for me.
And it's true. Will you take me with you?
Are you being serious?
Serious? Nothing is serious in this country, anymore.
But I've gotten used to this life.
If you'll take me, I'll go with you.
What time are you leaving?
At 4:30 in the morning. See what I mean?
You don't have much time at all to finish him off.
You don't think it's enough?
The wake will start at about 11, and it'll probably last about...
...three hours.
it's easy. He'll have to go to sleep.
All right Maciek, I'll see you later.
And... Don't party too hard.
See you.
So now you're alone?
Unfortunately.
When's yourfriend coming? At 10?
Yes.
So you could probably leave by 10:30.
You could tell them you've got a headache,
and you don't feel so good.
Miss Krysia...
They can wait.
I'd like to pay...
They can wait.
I'd like to pay.
So, will you leave early?
And if I did, then what?
I live at the Monopol Hotel.
Really? That's very kind of you.
First floor, room 17.
Are you sure of that?
You can check foryourself.
Unfortunately, I only check bills.
Only bills?
Yes, but they never add up, anyway.
You really only check bills?
No, seriously now, you can check foryourself.
Well?
Well?
I swear, these violets smell better by the minute.
Room 17. First floor. 10:30. I swear I'll be there.
Miss Krysia.
There you go, Editor.
Excuse me?
The bill.
Hold on... what's the hurry, miss Krysia?
Miss Krysia...
Oh, yes, just a minute...
Well, look who's here! How are you doing, sir?
If you'll forgive me, I'm presently on duty.
Well, I see that the great Town Council
is displeased with the press.
I don't know anything about that.
There was no trace of any invitation to the banquet.
Excuse me, sir,
but Editor Pawlicki received an invitation.
Ah, Pawlicki, Pawlicki...
I guess that Editor Pieniazek doesn't count, anymore?
Sir, the Mayor himself made up the guest list.
Exactly! My friend, Swiecki...
No! Mayor Swiecki... The Mayor.
What?
What are you staring at me like that for?
Oh, no reason. Ijust happened to think
of something that you might find very interesting.
-Me?
-Yes.
No... But... What is it?
It's just a little tiny problem. If my friend Swiecki...
Mr. Editor..
All right, if you insist.
If my former-friend, Swiecki should go to Warsaw,
would he orwouldn't he take his present secretary with him?
What? Do you know something?
Editor Pieniazek is well informed.
Miss Krysia, two double vodkas, please.
But...
Two, please. Let's have a drink.
No, no. I'm here on duty, and if the Mayor...
Well, that's great. We should drink
to the Minister's health, especially if on duty!
So, you mean, it's true?
Which branch did he get?
National Health.
Not bad. Damn, I wish it had been Foreign Affairs.
Yes, he would have liked that,too.
All right, here's to Foreign Affairs!
So, is he going to take me with him?
Of course he will. Shit always floats to the top.
You'll see where I'll be in five years.
Yeah, sure. Here's to the five-year plan...
And how are you today?
I am doing well, as usual, Mayor.
See, guys? Finally a citizen who never complains.
Please forgive me, Mayor, I know the Editor,
but not the other gentleman. Exactly.
I'm not sure as to which position he holds.
Well, if you find titles so important,
then you may, from now on, referto me as...
How, Mayor?
... as Minister, my dear Mr. Slomka.
Careful there, Mr. Slomka.
Gentlemen. Wonderful, Mr. Slomka.
Bravo. But where is Mr. Derewnowski?
Has he been here?
Yes, Mayor... I beg your pardon... Minister.
Mr. Derewnowski kept an eye on everything,
and, I must say, expressed his satisfaction.
Where is he? He should be here.
Do you want a snack? No?
Well, what exactly do you want, then?
Everything! A lot of money!
You'll have it! You sure?
I've been poorfor long enough!
Miss? Miss, two more!
Who is it?
It's me.
Did you really think I would come?
Yes.
And, do you know why I came?
It's simple. I could neverfall in love with you.
Hello?
What? You don't want to fall in love?
With you?
No, in general.
Not really.
On principle?
Why complicate life?
It complicates itself.
So why add new complications?
Hello?
What?
Well tell me something about yourself.
Why ?
We lived in the country.
My parents had an estate.
Before the war?
Yes, near Poznan.
And afterwards?
We moved to Warsaw.
''We''?
My mother and I.
My fatherwas arrested by the Germans right away.
Did he die?
Yes. In Dachau.
That's all there is to tell.
Is your mother alive?
No. She died during the Uprising.
Any otherfamily?
Fortunately, no.
''Fortunately''?
Less people to lose.
Yes, that's true.
Do you have any family?
None whatsoever.
Will you stay here for a while?
I don't know. I think I will, for now.
What's next?
I neverthink that far ahead.
You know, I wasn't positive that you'd come.
You don't even know me.
You don't know me, either.
Come on, let's go.
Did you invite me? Or didn't you?
Are you the Minister's Secretary? Or aren't you?
I invited you, but not on that side...
Both sides are good.
From now on, there's only going to be one side...
Nonsense! You can go from one side...
to the other... Both sides are good!
Are you taking your secretary with you?
Of course.
He's a great guy. Hard worker.
I'll make a man of him.
Will I be Director someday?
You will, you will...
I will...
Yes, come on...
I'll lead you, towards our glorious future!
What's the meaning of this? Where have you been?
And what's he doing here?
Well... actually... it kind of just happened...
Ijust thought, Mr. Mayor...
Oh, I mean, Mr. Minister, that the press...
What are you mumbling about? What's wrong with you?
Congratulations. Allow me, Mr. Minister,
in the name of the Democratic Press, to...
This is unheard of!
Congratulations from Russia, Comrades,
and best wishes for Poland.
Thank you.
Comrade Wrona, the Security Police Chief.
I can't even look you in the eye
afterwhat happened in the forest.
I thought it would go differently.
At least we're no longerthere.
Good evening Comrades. Please, come in.
Get out of my way...
Are you going to go, or not?
No! This is a democracy, isn't it?
You'll be sorry if you don't leave.
Are you threatening me?
Wait and see!
You're threatening me?
And who's the state's head ass-kisser?
Shut up!
You didn't kiss ass? Tell me you didn't do it!
Did you?
Yes, I did.
Poland has blown up in ourfaces.
Will I be Director?
You'll be Director.
There are still too few of us.
We need to pull more people together.
Yeah, but who?
What do you mean ''who''? The nation.
Have you been drinking, Mr. Editor?
Of course I was. ...I did... and so should you!
That type of fooling around
should be left to the bourgeoisie!
You don't like it?
No.
Don't you worry.
One day... you'll like it!
Mr. Swiecki, the Minister.
My dear Comrades and Citizens.
Today, May 8th, 1945, is a great day for captive Poland.
How is everything, Mrs. Jegielska?
They're in the middle of the speeches.
Oh... The Minister himself is speaking.
Anybody puke yet?
No! It's still too early forthat!
There's an orderto everything.
First they do the speeches, and then people come running here.
I think you'll make a nice amount, today.
I think so, too.
It's probably somebody's birthday.
What are you talking about? It's not anyone's birthday.
Maybe an anniversary, then.
Nonsense! It's all for Poland!
Ijust thought of something.
We've only known each otherfor a few minutes,
but I feel like it's been much longer.
Tell me.
What?
What are you really like? You seem different than before.
Is that bad?
God. I don't think it matters at all.
Not even a bit?
Are you cold?
A bit.
Better?
Yes.
Why do you always wearthose sunglasses?
As a souvenir, of my unhappy love forthe country.
It's nothing, really. I spent too much time
in the sewers during the Uprising.
No, no.
Why no?
I don't want to. It doesn't make sense.
Why not?
Don't you understand? You're leaving.
I don't want any parting, or memories, or anything else
that we'll have to leave behind when this is over.
Not even happy memories?
Not if they're only going to be memories.
See, you have your life, and I have mine.
We met each other by accident, but it was nice.
What more do we want? What?
Nothing. I think our neighbor is back.
That's awful. You can hear everything around here.
Awful.
Hold me.
Do you have any cigarettes?
Of course. Would you like American or Hungarian ones?
Hungarian, please.
What are you doing tomorrow?
It is tomorrow.
Let's spend the day together.
Where were you captured?
In the forest.
From Wilk's group...
From Captain Wilk's group.
What are your names?
Krzysztof.
Is that it?
Krzysztof Zawadzki.
And your name?
Turn around.
How old are you?
A hundred.
How old are you?
A hundred and one.
You have to go.
I should... my friend will kill me.
Could I get a light off of you, by any chance?
A light? Sure.
Thank you.
What happened?
Nothing. Stay with me for half an hour. All right?
All right.
It's starting to rain.
Here you go.
What are you thinking about? You don't want to talk about it.
I was just thinking...
I keep thinking of things I shouldn't be thinking about.
But I swear I'm not thinking of it, anymore.
Don't look at me like that.
I wasn't.
Then what?
You still don't know?
It's going to start pouring soon.
Do you want to go back?
No.
God. Life can be so beautiful sometimes.
Knock on wood!
It was just a wish.
Knock on wood anyway!
Life is dangerous.
Let's hide in there.
No, there!
Won't you be cold?
Look at that. An old crypt.
And an inscription...
So often, are you as a blazing torch with flames
of burning rags falling about you Flaming,
you know not if flames freedom bring or death.
Consuming all that you must cherish
if ashes only will be left, and want Chaos and tempest
...I shall engulf...
It's too hard to read it. I can't see anything.
The poem is by Norwid.
... Orwill the ashes hold the glory of a starlike diamond...
The Morning Star of everlasting triumph.
That's beautiful.
Will the ashes hold the glory of a starlike diamond.
And what exactly are we?
You... are definitely a diamond.
Listen... I have to tell you something.
Nothing sad, I hope.
No.
Actually, who knows?
I don't know. I'd like to change some things,
and lead a different life. It's really hard to talk about this.
You don't have to. I understand.
Really?
It's pretty simple, actually.
There are things I've never really thought about.
Life always managed to work itself out, somehow,
and all you had to do was survive.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Ijust want to lead a normal life. Go back to school to study.
Maybe go to the Technical Institute.
What about you?
You weren't supposed to talk about sad things.
Was that sad? Should I knock on wood?
If I had known yesterday what I know now...
...I probably wouldn't have come to you, then.
Until now, I've never known anything about love.
I really didn't.
Oh, my heel!
Where?
Don't worry, I've fixed biggerthings.
What's this, a circus?!
What do you think you're doing here?
Can't you see that the lady has had some trouble?
Do you expect me to look for a shoemaker at this time of night?
You should both be ashamed of yourselves!
This is how young people act these days!
They don't even have respect forthe dead, anymore.
What?
Don't you see? You're acting all happy,
while two murdered people lie there next to you.
Come in.
Where have I heard this?
Don't you remember?
Oh, I got really drunk that night.
This wine's pretty treacherous.
Alba Seta. Ourfirst days in Spain.
Grabowski died in the forest. Rubacki in France in 1944.
Do you rememberthat there were 36 of us at first?
Yes.
And who's left now? Those were some good times.
These are going to be good times, too.
I don't know what to think anymore.
If it was up to me, I'd do something about them quickly.
That mob down there doesn't represent all of Poland.
I know, but that doesn't make it any easier.
I'm not sure how to govern.
Don't learn to. Believe me.
There is so much suffering and wrong in this country.
Everyone carries his own burden.
You have to understand.
What's there to understand?
German. Did you find the killers?
No, but we'll find them.
There are some english ones here, too.
When you're on the receiving end, there's no difference.
Let's get some sleep.
We'll deal with all of this tomorrow.
It's going to be a nice day. The rain has stopped.
Until tomorrow.
Until tomorrow.
When are you leaving?
I think it'll be tomorrow.
But I could probably change that.
Change what?
Some things.
Could you?
Maybe.
Buying yourself some flowers?
Listen, I need to talk to you about something serious.
Haven't we already talked about serious things?
Well?
You know I'm not a coward.
So what?
Please try to understand, Andrzej,
I can't go on killing, and hiding.
Ijust want to live, and nothing more!
I don't have to understand.
Are you speaking as a soldier, or as a friend?
I don't understand.
I think you don't want to understand.
About this, I can only speak to you as your superior officer.
Nobody forced you to do this.
You took the project on yourself.
You're my friend and...
Cut the teary-eyed crap. Have you fallen in love?
That's your problem.
But if you put your private affairs before ours...
Well, you know what they call that...
Andrzej. I've never been a deserter.
And what are you doing now?
You wanted this job. You took it on by yourself.
Don't you understand that people can change?
I'm not running away.
But you want to run away. You want me to say:
''Great, you've fallen in love. Do as you want.''
How many times have we been in battle together?
What if you had fallen in love then?
Would you have come to me also?
How about during the Uprising?
That was completely different.
No. You keep forgetting that you're one of us.
And that counts for something.
Well, you've done it.
You can now say goodbye to your career.
You won't be so cocky tomorrow,
when you realize you're fired.
So what? I don't care. He's firing me?
Life, it's like a house of cards.
Here, have a drink. Have a drink, sir.
No. I'll do it myself.
Rashly?
No. I want to live.
I'll be waiting foryou in the morning. 4:30, remember.
No.
I guess, then, that this is where we part.
I doubt we'll ever meet again.
Only one of us will be proven right. See ya.
Bye.
Andrzej!
Tell me, please.
Do you believe in all of this?
Me? That's not important.
Please, Mister, buy some violets.
Please, buy some.
Come in.
Forgive me, Comrade Szczuka, but this is very important.
I've come with a message from Major Wrona.
Do you have a son, Comrade?
Marek. He's 17.
Bad news.
What's wrong?
He's a part of Wilk's group. We've captured him.
Hold on, Major Wrona will send a carforyou.
I'll tell them to let you know when it has arrived.
Okay, I'll wait. Thank you, Lieutenant.
Do you know the name Wilk?
No.
What did you do during the Uprising?
I shot. At Germans.
But now you shoot Poles.
And you shoot sparrows.
A carwill arrive soon.
Tell Comrade Szczuka to come down when it does.
Yes, sir.
Ahh, finally. Here's to Warsaw.
It's a beautiful night.
I think I better go for a walk before my trip.
Are you leaving already?
Unfortunately. My wife is jealous.
Stop it, my ears hurt!
Well, gentlemen! It's time to go home!
Hold on for a moment, gentlemen.
You are artists, are you not?
At this time of night? Director, please...
Time should mean absolutely nothing to an artist.
I demand absolute obedience.
It's no good. We've never played it before.
No! No excuses. Play, young man. Harder, harder!
Ladies and Gentlemen! This is the last dance!
In A Major!
What happened?
Nothing. I have to leave.
Now?
My train leaves at 4:30.
You couldn't change things?
No.
Ladies and Gentlemen, no more excuses!
Don't say anymore. Just go.
Fantastic! And now a great discovery!
A salute to the new day!
A brilliant idea.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Polonaise!
Aren't they all happy?
If we could only celebrate in Warsaw...
Well, as long as I'm here,
you can count on getting a nice room.
Thank you. Goodbye.
Hold on for a sec!
Would you give my love to Ujazdowski Street?
Hi.
Come here.
Give that to me. You've changed your mind!
What?
Don't you know? Don't you!
The only reason you came was because you got fired!
Hold on! Please, stop!
Hey, watch it!
Stop, or I'll shoot!
Be careful! He's armed!
He couldn't have gotten far.
I saw him.
This way!
