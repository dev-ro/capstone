The other officials seem to have already joined the rebels
If your highness can hold out until the army arrives
We should be able to reclaim the palace
The palace doesn't seem to be the only thing we have lost
You may be an official who guards the king
But aren't you also a Joseon warrior?
Your king ordered you to kill your comrades and forsake those who went to war
Why are you still wasting your time?
Is this all it means to be a warrior to you?
Stand aside
Caught you
Dad, what do you think? I'm better than you now, right?
We should be able to get lot of money for it
How cute
Is it happening again?
It's nothing, it's okay
Let's hurry back
It's already bad enough your eyes are swollen
But I think there's a build up of fluids inside
Then did it get worse?
Don't worry too much. If you go to the capital
you should be able to get good medicine. The owner there
owes me a favor. I'll let her know.
We're counting on you.
Of course.
If you wait too long even the good medicine won't work
You must go before it's still too late
There is a way to treat it, but how can you just ignore it
What are you so afraid of to be always just staying in the woods?
Aren't you bored?
You think the world will be so easy if you go down there?
As long as you are fine, that's good enough for me
If you don't want to go, then you can stay here and I'll just go by myself
They asked for 25 women in exchange for each prisoner and for men...
Their requests are becoming more outrageous. What are we going to do?
It'll be difficult for the court to pay for that many prisoners
I think we should let the families of the prisoners handle it themselves for now
Right. For the time being the state finances must be
used to maintain the power of the court.
But we can't just ignore their requests. What if they...
Are you saying we should give up our dignity
and just keep agreeing to all their demands?
Your Majesty, I'll meet with them and figure out their true intentions.
Please do that
At this rate, won't eventually we'll end up offering even our children as gifts?
He seems to be trying to avoid war, but I think he's got something in his pocket
What's your plan, my lord?
Is it true you'll be resigning?
Yes. I've been here too long.
Sir, now is not the time.
You are really going to resign?
Have you heard of the Huang group? I heard they are a trade company that sell prisoners as slaves.
That's only a front, they are actually assassins.
I heard a rumor their leader and the envoy came to the capital
I don't know what they are up to, but the government has become divided because of the Qing
It's probably if this is discussed before the court.
I can't figure out what he's thinking
Maybe he blames himself for the country being like this.
What if he's just speaking nonsense
He will step into the fight. He wants to fight someone strong
Isn't that the attitude of a warrior?
Come. Take a look.
It's cool, isn't it?
Maybe it cause were close to the border, but there's lots of foreigners.
Have a look. It's hot.
As a fellow Joseon, please understand our situation
You should understand our situation
I have to go buy again, then put them on the boat and bring them here
feed them and give them a place to sleep
I understand, but if you increase the price all of a sudden
Mother
It's okay.
Go to your father
It was the nobles who increased the price, so you should go ask them for money
They were taken as prisoners in the war but now being sold as slaves
If you give me your daughter, then we might let your wife go
Please wait
The chairman is waiting, do you want to die?
Sorry.
If you dare to make trouble again,
I will cut your neck.
Let's go
Sir, I beg you...
Father!
Your dirty hands dare touching me!
How insolent!
It's best not get involved
Who's making trouble here?
Who are you? Get off your horses and identify yourselves
We are Qing emissaries.
You think even if your king came he could arrest us?
I dare you to arrest me!
Let's go.
Father.
Let's go.
I don't understand what Joseons officials are thinking
Why do you still insist on maintaining self-respect?
He says he doesn't understand why there are still people who respect this country
Even if the parents get sick, how can children stop caring about their parents?
If you keep believing in your dying parents
maybe the child will die first.
If the child dies first, isn't that also fortunate?
This is the king's cousin and chairman of the Huang group
I've heard a lot about you
and that you are fluent in Korean
Not at all, one my mothers was from Joseon
I hear in Joseon that kind of child is called a bastard
I hope from now on you learn to speak Qing
From now on, we'll see each other often, right?
You could have prepared better tea. Just means we've left Joseon alone for too long
Do you know how to raise a stray dog?
In Joseon, we don't catch and raise stray dogs
I'll tell you, first you tie it up, then kill it's babies one by one.
It'll cry like crazy, but it'll still end up wagging its tail afterward
We may be a tributary state, but there are still rules
I heard a rumor there's a great swordsman, it must be him?
I seem to have offended you. How about to change the mood
We go watch a sword sparring match together
Be sure to hold back if needed
The other warriors are watching
Regardless of your opponent's skill, just follow to my instructions.
Your sword just for show?
Your sword skill is impressive.
Thanks to you, I enjoyed watching the fight.
I heard he's the best swordsman in Joseon.
If you had let me, I would have had his head for you
Do you really think so?
Are you saying I would have lost?
Very interesting.
Follow me.
There must be a misunderstanding. It's the monk who owes me a debt.
What? He clearly told me...
You rotten monk.
Even if I did owe him. The medicine is difficult to obtain unless you are a high ranking official
The price wouldn't be cheap either.
I understand. Let's just go.
We aren't asking you to obtain it for free
We only brought hides without scars, so it should fetch a good price.
It can't be obtained so easily with just some hides
Leave the leather. We'll pay a little more than it's worth
No thanks. We are not beggars.
My dad always says nothing is free
and that there's always some other motive
Let's go, dad.
They are here.
Dad, aren't those the bastards from earlier?
Hurry up, let's go
It's a honor for you to come to our place
Political games are for officials
I'm just a merchant here to have fun.
If you want to have fun. There's no better place than Joseon.
Tea smells good.
How about doing business together?
I could pay a lot for slaves and you could make a lot of profits
I appreciate your offer, but we aren't capable enough to deal with selling people
Aren't selling comfort woman, the same as selling people
This is not a place for comfort women.
She's better than a man
I heard you could hire swordsmen as assassins here
Could I request that?
They are only guards for myself
Please rest and leave
I heard he was crazy
Is he someone important?
Don't get involved with them.
I was stupid to believe that monk
When did you buy it?
Enjoy the food
Already leaving?
Just give me 4 coins
Here is the money.
Aunt!
Tae-ok... isn't this Tae-ok?
How are you?
Being an inn keeper is as good as it gets
Wait, let me see.
This little girl is all grown up now.
It must be cause you raised her with so much care
You will have a lot of men falling for her
Long time no see.
That cold attitude will never change
What do you like about him so much with his cold attitude?
All men care about are women
All that matters about a man is they don't talk too much and have a large
A large what?
Nothing
You must be tired after the long journey. Go rest, I will make you some food.
This feels good!
You said a young woman?
I don't want just anyone taking care of the sick, so you don't need to worry much.
If so, there happens to be a girl.
It won't do any good for others to know, so look into it quietly
Yes, I will.
Eat well.
Thank you, sir.
Give this to your mom.
Thank you sir.
A swordsman's hands
shouldn't be holding a bowl
How about
I can ask the king to let you work under me, what do you think?
When the swordsman is with a master who understands his worth
Isn't that when a swordsman really shines
I have resigned, I am no longer interested in any position.
I have a habit of getting anything I want it.
One word, and I can have all the prisoners released from Qing
I heard you've drawn your sword against the late king.
Before you draw your sword
think carefully about what will happen to Joseon.
Should I tell them to catch him?
No need, just let him be.
It will be more interesting.
You're awake.
Where did my dad go?
He headed out very early in the morning.
He doesn't even know the way well, where did he go on his own?
You're here, so he probably didn't go far
He'll be back soon. Just wait.
You are staying here
How did you know I was here
You were looking down on me for having no money not that long ago
No need for that.
You could say today I am your savior.
Really?
If I look after the sick, you will ask the envoy to obtain the medicine for me?
I promise.
Are you willing?
As long as I can get the medicine. I'll do anything.
But
what about my father
Before his eyes heal, we will find a place for your father and take care of him
Thank you!
Really thank you... thank you
Where will my father live?
New house?
I'm so happy.
She lives with her father who is going blind in the mountains.
I want to take her in as an adopted child
in exchange for something of value to her.
I feel...
I've seen a ghost.
You had that expression before you disappeared, and you have the same expression after suddenly reappearing
The child probably has grown a lot
She's a precious girl.
We will live quietly.
just like we're now in peace.
If so, I hope that happens
But even if you hide, you think the world won't change?
You will still hear the sound of the world crying.
I heard you were arrested.
Right?
Yes.
How?
Madam.
Where did Tae-ok go?
Earlier today, the Hwasang company was looking for her and took her.
But it seemed to be a good thing.
Yes, thank you.
How do you plan to convince your father?
He'll be able to see again
and I'll just be adopted into rich family for a little
There's no way he wouldn't allow it
They say no parent is willing to let go of their child
But they also say no parent can win an argument against their child
Don't worry.
Jeez, who are they? How scary.
Come on, take it off
Who said you can move?
Everyone get out!
What are you doing?
Didn't you tell us to rest?
Is this kind of behavior
What the chairman wants?
You dare to insult the chairman.
As expected, Joseon's fighting skills aren't that good
I will teach you today what a real man is like
Isn't this too much against a women?
Are you all right?
How dare this girl
Who the hell are you?
I'm her sick father. We are just stopped by for medicine
She didn't understand what she's doing, so please forgive her
What?
Okay then, if you kneel and apologize on her behalf
I'll forgive her.
How dare you
Be quiet.
Okay.
Father...
Good, I can let you go.
But, I have to teach your rude daughter a lesson.
I was right, you're a swordsman.
Let go of me!
Don't get involved
That's enough
I'll willing go with you, so put away your sword.
I'm relying on you.
Forgive me.
It doesn't matter...
whose daughter I am or why I had to live in hiding
You're my father who difficultly raised me
I'm fine, you don't need to worry.
Oh yes, there's a way to get the medicine
What does it mean?
They said I just need to be adopted and look after the sick for few years.
You want me to sell you
to treat my eyes?
After recovering, to see what?
Take a rest. We'll head home tomorrow.
Didn't you ever think I want
nice clothes and live in a nice house?
I may not a princess
but I want to live as a noble daughter comfortable now
Anyway, I made my decision.
If you want to go home, then go home by yourself.
Sir, Seung-ho has resigned and returned to his hometown.
We also have to think of a plan
You don't think...
he'll order us to send even our children as hostages
I have written a letter to His Majesty.
Let's wait a little longer.
It seems that I have to look into adopting a daughter.
I just feel at unease
it's times like this we have to be more careful
We just need to get by this moment
Even if the world changes, Joseon won't change
Are you really considering giving up?
Are you asking me as a warrior?
I, as a servant, dare to ask you.
Seung-ho
Regardless of anyone believes
Nothing is more important than the lives of the people
even if it's a king's
Aunt
My father
please help me look after my father
Fine, don't worry
Live happily
Understood?
The hell from past days
The cries of the people slain
Behead Hu Di's head
And restore order to the country
Enough
You said he used a stick.
Yes.
Were you also there?
That person...
I have no excuses
Very interesting.
Really interesting.
You can't live with your grown up daughter in the mountains forever
The world is so chaotic. Maybe being adopted child to a noble is better
I'll stop by soon.
Do not be like that. At least go see her face before you leave
Then won't you feeling more at ease
Aigoo
What is this?
They were so happy to get a daughter
It was because the gossips
the mother and child hanged themselves.
Poor child
Get ready. You will go to the villa as soon as preparations are done
Yes, father.
Are all their belongings loaded?
Yes sir.
As soon as the miss...
Beheading Hu Di's head.
I've read your letter.
Sir.
You think doing this
will break my intentions?
Let's see how long he will last
Thanks to dad, the child will die first.
That girl is the man with the cane's daughter
The king's assistant
only cares about his daughter's life.
What kind of joke is this
Not even a stray dog, but just some street rat
Stop.
Good, you came at the right time
They broke into my residence and are trying to harm my family.
Stop them
I don't hate you
because I believe I was blind back then.
What are you talking about?
I went against the previous king only because I was persuaded by your lowly words.
You must know, I also did it for this country.
That was, only for your own sake.
Run!
Where is that guy?
Bastard
You bastard, how dare you
My daughter, where is she?
He just told me to look into adopting a daughter
You said... Lee Mok-yo?
This is all my fault.
I'll help you find her.
Don't worry, just run away
Where do the swordsmen gather around here?
There is a bar where the swordsmen gather.
We can't mess with the envoy, what if something worse happens
My daughter has been kidnapped!
my only daughter
I'll send in special forces to get them all.
Your Majesty, the ministers have come
Come in
Welcome
We were discussing our armies at the borders
Why don't you join us
Who are they making a fuss to find at night
Trying to find a need in a haystack
Where are they saying to find them
Let's just say we couldn't find them and go drinking.
How dare you.
What are you doing?
Don't care, come on again, hurry up
Quick let's go
I just went to find you as ordered, but you weren't there
I just took the inn keeper to them
Where?
If your follow the river, there is a place with slaves
Forgive me, please spare my life
If you want money, take as much as you want
Take a good look
Anyone who comes to save you
I will make sure they end up like this
Drink, drink
Sir, help
Please help my child's father.
Help, help
These bastards
They need to get beaten to come to their senses
Be quiet
You came to save someone here?
Kill him, and come quick
Eat, eat. I'll be there soon!
I asked you a question, answer me
Get off me, you bastards.
Sir.
What do you want?
An hour ago, she was still here.
Young girls are imprisoned here.
Aigoo.
Cing Yi's face was so pale.
Honey, wake up!
You can't just leave us, what will we do?
Open your eyes.
The child hasn't been born yet, you can't just leave.
We'll quietly bring back your daughter.
Please understand. We received orders not to have problems with the Qing.
If there is a big problem
If we can take care of it secretly
There won't be any problem.
If you help this time, I'll support you
from now on
Go prepare the soldiers
Yes.
Won't there be a problem if you keep doing this
Are you teaching me?
I do not dare.
You handle politics like idiots
That's why I came to take care of it myself
I'm sorry.
When stepped on a worm,
You need to step on it completely
So it can't wiggle around again
I'll do my best.
Where's Huya?
He's still not back.
He's like a wild boar, looking for prey.
We will go tomorrow as soon as everyone returns
Take the girls to the boat.
Understood.
I will try to persuade him first.
but stay alert, ok?
Yes.
This is where the Qing envoy lives, don't carelessly draw out your swords.
Yes.
We are Joseon soldiers.
If you don't resist, we won't hurt you
As long as you hand over...
Why do Joseon talk so much before fighting?
If you surrendered, you would have saved some lives
But you dare break into the residence of the Qing envoy with swords.
Even your king can't protect you.
Please
just let save my daughter.
Take up weapons!
Shoot!
How could he be here...
You...
are the one who was guarding the king
My daughter.
My daughter.
Please help
Stay alive
Stay alive and watch over
this country you changed
I beg you, I'm willing to do anything.
I beg you, save my daughter.
She had no mother since childhood.
Please...
Father.
Tae-oj.
We were attacked by the man with the cane again
Do you remember him?
Just in case, we need to prepare
Even you can't just stay here
That so?
Forgive me.
That's not what I meant
Your tongue will cost you your life.
First, we need to catch him
Bring the daughter.
Yes.
That's not necessary.
He will find you.
Do you know him?
You aren't going blind anymore, but you still need to be careful.
I will repay you.
You might end up completely blind
Is this all it means to be a warrior
to you?
If you draw your sword against me
Think carefully about
what will happen to Joseon
You'll find Huang group's ship if you go to the pier
Step aside
Is this what you call belief?
I'm trying to stop the country from suffering again
My daughter is my country to me
Do you think you can beat me with those eyes?
A sword is just for stabbing
and cutting
Yes.
The late king favored your kind of sword.
He can't even see clearly...
If your lost, just die then.
Follow me.
If you beat me
I will return your daughter.
Father.
Come on!
Father.
Cowardly bastard!
You wanted to fight
so don't blame me if you die.
Cruel bastard, you think...
Stop!
Father!
Tae-ok.
Tae-ok.
Father.
Tae-ok.
It is okay now...
It is okay.
Let's go.
Let us go home.
What do you think of that kid's sword?
Even though it's fast, it lacks form and seemed very reckless.
Doesn't it seem natural since it lacks form
Remember
This is your sword to carry from now on
Tae-ok.
We're not lost, are we?
Of course not.
Just follow me.
I'm fine with just living in the mountains now
Why are we going down the mountain?
I want to see the world now too
