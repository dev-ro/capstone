Monkey King, you bastard
You've promised Buddha
To help the Longevity Monk
to get scriptures in the west
But the King Bull and you decided to
eat your master
Do you know you've made
a real big mistake?
Shut up!
You've followed me for 3 days
I didn't beat you up
because you're a woman
Don't think that I'm afraid of you
Monkey King
be polite to Goddess!
Shut up
You scare me again
If you're not scared of me
you needn't hurt Purple Fairy
and stole her Pandora's Box
You just wanna escape
Now, I can't escape
I will fight with you
What's up?
Don't be angry
You may violate the rule
Monkey King, you're so naughty!
I've told you
not to throw things!
Look!
You've thrown away the stick
Pandora's Box is the treasure
You'll pollute the environment
You'll hurt kids
If there are no kids
it is bad to hurt plants
What's up?
Let go!
You want?
Speak up if you want!
Why do you keep silent?
Although your eyes are full of sincerity
I'm very glad, you still have to speak up
Do you really like?
Take it
Do you really like?
You
Damn!
Monkey King....
See
this guy keeps talking all the time
we don't know what he's talking about
He's just like a fly hanging around
Sorry, not a fly
It's a swarm of flies flying near your ears
Flying into your brain
Help!
So I catch that fly. Open its belly
Take out its intestine
Put its intestine around its own neck
Then I pull the intestine tightly
The tongue comes out
I use a blade and cut!
Wow!
All the people keep silent
Now you know why I need to kill
Monkey King, you have so many excuses
You don't want to get
scriptures in the west
Shut up please! Beat!
I've got a super body. You can't hurt me
I don't scare of any god
I'm destroy all devils
Being master,
I should take the responsibility
Please let him go!
I have to do so,
I need to report to Heaven Emperor
Goddess, please tell Heaven Emperor
I can sacrifice my life for him
Namonitabhaya...
What did he said?
Give him the pork
Stand by!
A woman is coming in!
Asst. Master,
do you think soldiers are coming?
This is why you're called "Blind Bing"
Didn't you see Dumby shaking his ass?
Do you think he has hemorrhoids?
OK, even if he has hemorrhoids
he is a soldier with hemorrhoids
So what to be feared about him?
Who the hell you are?
Don't you reckon I'm a woman?
What do you come here for?
The world's gone mad
A weary lady
looking for a shelter
I wanna brush off the dust of my past
Do you know what place it is?
This is not a nice place.
You all look gruesome
I don't think it is a decent tavern
Is this a slaughter-house?
Yes, we are. How dare you come in
You're in danger already
I'm not sure who's in danger
I think you're in danger
You can be robbers
So can I
Who the hell you are?
Blossom
Nothing get into my way and survive
Money or your heads
Why does Ma'am 30th come to
Mt Wuyue?
This devil is a fierce robber
Is here having big business?
Why do you still
put the money on your head?
Put it back!
She said it is our head or the money, Master
What are you talking about?
Asst. Master!
You coward!
How can you be my assistant?
Master, I'm not Asst. Master!
I'm Blind Bing!
He is Asst. Master
Yes, I'm Asst. Master
I will make you regret!
Go away!
Look at yourself.
Mousing around, so shameful
How can you follow me
around with their hair?
Master, I'm here!
Come out!
Coming
Master, you're hit by Kunlun Sage's
7 Ultimate Fists
Your wounds are spreading
Shut up
you knelt down that time
and I got hit in the nose
Master, here!
The 7 Ultimate Fists really hurt Master
Master, I was scared, so I knelt down
It is heard that people who got hit
by the 7 Ultimate Fists
will have disease in his eyes
Then he'll become dumb
After that he can't speak properly
At last, his body explodes and he's dead
Master, there's something wrong
with your eyes!
I am OK!
I only concentrate my eyesight
on a single point
I only change my usual way of vision
Do you want to take my position?
No, Master, I don't dare
You don't dare? I am gonna kill you!
Kill you!
Can you cry out for me?
Ah....
Ok, let's get our weapons and search
Ma'am 30th
No need to scare! I'm here!
I'm the leader of the Axe Gang
My nickname is Joker
It is nice to meet famous Ma'am 30th
What are you gonna
do here?
I just wanna stay here for a while
A while? How long is it?
3 full days
Maybe 30 or 50 years
I'll leave when I meet the person
who I want to see
I don't think you can wait so long
What are you doing?
I've just had a piss!
You had a piss here?
This is why you have so much water to bath
What are you talking about?
I said live to see that person
Master...
I'm not that easy to kill
Ask my brothers first
You have no guts...
You betray me!
God!
Kill us all if you can!
Forgive me...
Forgive me, heroine...
Stupid! Do you think she will let you go?
I'm gonna fight
even if I lost my life!
That's fine. Since you're willing to beg me
I won't kill you now
Thanks a lot!...
You...you're so righteous!
You're so good!
You all clean your sole and wait for me outside
Why is there a scar?
This is not a scar, it is only dirt
Go clean it
or I'll cut the whole leg off
Master
why she wanna see our sole?
It is lucky that you don't wanna see our ass
Are you scared?
I'm not! You are scared!
Why?
You have hemorrhoids
She'll say they are not clean enough
and cut them off
Why do you know I have hemorrhoids?
Blind Bing peeped on your shower
Why did you peep on me?
I not only peeped on you
I've peeped on you all
Why is there so much hair?
Sure
I've got more in other parts
What?
Are you excited now?
Where did you say has more hair?
No
in fact I only have hair on my head and sole
Do you think
they grow on the wrong places?
From now on, I'll check all the people
passing here!
Check what?
Check their sole
If you discover a guy having
three birthmarks, tell me
Master! We don't go to rob
but check people's sole
If the others know that,
they'll say we're perverts
We can plot against her
Poison her, make her faint
then rape and kill her!
A good plot!
You think so
You shall administer the plan
I don't think I can do this
I go, no need to kneel down
I don't want to! I can't control my legs
Master, your wound is expanding
I still have both hands
I won't give up!
Master has fallen into a shit pit!
Master!
Have you found the three birthmarks?
Why does everyone tell me to find
the three birthmarks?
You can save him when you find them
What are you talking about?
Where are we?
Who?
Dreaming
Did you kill that bitch?
Spider! Spider...
It's only a spider
It's big
How big is it?
I've told you to tidy up the place
The spiders are bigger than me
What should I do?
It keeps running after me
Maybe I'm handsome
What?
What's up?
A spider is running after Master?
This way? No....
This way!
Fine, be quick!
How come?
Help!
Come here! I'm here!
Be quick!
I'm here!
Help me!
Blind Bing!
Nothing in the front!
Turn back, turn back!
No! it's Master! Master...
Isn't it a cockroach?
It's Master
Great! Go!
You sons of bitches, deceive me
Master, I'm coming
What am I touching?
Master is saved...
Asst. Master is so happy.
What is he holding?
Master, didn't he carry you out?
I'm fine, let's go home...
Take a bath, go to bed sooner
Don't hang around tonight
Let go!
Spider!
Blindy
Help
Who?
Burn it!
Have a rest first
Burn it!
Don't let him go...burn it
Burn it!
No need to be frightened
Burn him...
He's there...
It's over there, go there...
Here is another
This one is smaller
Freeze!
Where?
It's there!
There!
Only two claws are left.
Let me break you in half
Go to hell
Don't go!
It's here
Beat it!
Give it to me
All spread out! Let me burn it!
Go to hell!
Burning!
Very hot!
It's Master's voice
Help!
It's Master. Help him!
It's Master
Help!
Master, your cock is burning
Be quick
Get the water...
Put out the fire
Dying!
Be quick
I'm going to out the fire, too
You can't put out the fire with straw.
Stay away!
Master, it's OK!
I'll put it out!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop burning...
Out you go...!
Stop burning!
I can't take this...
The fire is out! Are you OK?
You have to step on him and
put the fire out
Moron!
Who burned me?
Not me!
I have no idea
I know it's you!
I know what you're thinking!
You wanna take my place!
No...Master...
Master's eyes are Ok.
No, I didn't do that
Master, you've recovered
I'm cured! Why?
I know!
You must hurt yourself in order to
cure the wounds
It's reasonable!
You have to thank Asst. Master
If he didn't hit you at the crotch
you won't be healed so fast
Do you have an affair with him?
I love you so much
Go to hell! Stop it!
I've told you to kill Ma'am 30th.
Have you done that?
Ma'am 30th is a devil!
Spider Woman!
I'm a rational man
I can't accept such ridiculous thing!
Kill her!
Master, aren't you scared?
Of course not! I'm healed.
I will defeat her!
Great! You have guts!
You said I had guts?
Yes, but forget I'd say that
Master
You just get into her room
and finish her off
We'll cover you up!
Why I go first everytime...
You said you would cover me up
so stay closer
Steady
we've got weapons
We'll throw them at her
You'll kill me, too
Don't be silly!
You won't die, you'll only get hurt!
Sons of bitches!
Get! You are not fooling me
Listen to me
Stop that
Fainted?
Big Cow, Younger Tiger
You're all useless. Let me do this
What?
You faked the fainted?
This is a tactic.
It is very useful
Where is the leak?
Asst. Master, you're bleeding
Don't scare!
I can stop the bleeding
by myself
it's not picturesque
but it is unique
You may love this place, eventually
Good night!
Master...
She is a devil!
Yes!
She is a real devil!
My heart is pounding!
Master, stop it!
You're a righteous man, a hero
It is my pleasure
to be your friend
The money put on your bros' heads
is all given to you to buy drinks
Thank you very much, Ma'am 30th
Master, she's not really good-looking
But I like her!
Only thrust the thigh once,
but there're so many holes
What do you mean?
Sister, why did you leave?
You ran to this poor village
and you're forced to reveal
your real image
What are you doing here?
How about you?
I just want to have a walk
You're waiting for the Longevity Monk
you wanna eat his flesh
You can make Granpa Buddha
speak out this top secret
So do I
Nonsense!
Nonsense?
Why did you come to Mt Wuyue?
This was called "Fingers Mountain" in the past
It's the prison for this monkey
The top secret says that
he'll become human
and he has three birthmarks on his sole
you can find the Monk
if you know where Monkey King is.
Sister, do you still think
I'm speaking nonsense?
You just want to see that monkey
You can do nothing even if you see him
The difference is that
he died in Goddess's hands last time
but he died in my hands this time
It will benefit
only one person
You know the reason!
Do you wanna fight over him with me?
Do you think only you can fake face?
Who?
Devil...!
What did you see?
Nothing
No!
What are you doing down there?
I wanna tie the lace
If the secret of the monk leaked
I'll kill you
Then, all devils gather at Fingers Mountain
beg for the flesh of the Longevity Monk
Tell the King about this
he will bestow on us
Even a bull is talking.
So many devils here this time
Go...go away
If I go now, I'm a coward!
No, report to Master
Master
This mountain was called
Fingers Mountain in the past
The Longevity Monk and the
Monkey King will meet here
My bull is talking
Those two things
one has 8 legs, one's head...
You two haven't slept?
What are you talking about?
ah...
Two baby pigs are born
One has 8 legs
One has a very heavy head
Master, we're rich now
We needn't to be robbers anymore...
We didn't rear any pigs
We didn't rear any pigs?
Or I'm speaking in my dream!
Ok, I'm leaving, please take a rest
We're leaving
Walk both girls away
No!
I will order someone to search for
the guy you wanna see
Thank you master
Good night! Go!
Go! Go!
Nothing can be done this time
Why does Jing Jing have no reaction
to this image?
Nothing I can do
Go!
Don't kill me!...Don't kill me!
I just wanna have fun with you
Do you like playing?
Come and have fun
Is it funny?
Yes!
Ok, let's play again
Play again?
I don't wanna play....
You said who's got eight claws?
I can't remember it...
What?
No!
My head looks like this?
Yes...! Oh no!
She's not changed yet
Not yet?
I'll kill him
No
Why?
I'm gonna mesmerize him
he'll be my undercover agent
Hi
Ghost!
Go to have a look
You said a ghost!
Oh dear!
Don't be pretentious around here
Or I will cut you into pieces
You're so brutal!
Look at me!
Mesmerizing!
Who?
It's a long night, no mood to sleep
I thought I am the only one
But Jing Jing, you're sleepless, too?
Yes, why can't you sleep?
Just because of Jing Jing!
Me?
yes, when I saw you
I made up my mind that
I wouldn't be a robber
I just wanna show my sincerity
I can't face my past
Like what you see?
You're monkey?
Monkey?
Monkey King
Monkey King?
You think you're alright with a human face?
Human Face?
I have to use Skeleton Fire on you
You gonna burn me again!
Why?
Did I make a mistake?
Why?
Why did you use flame bomb to burn me?
Why did you shave off your beard?
You're just another guy
without the beard
Really?
You can't do anything
Do you want to be a scholar instead of a robber?
I've thought about this
Please stop changing image
being a robber is
a good job
I know
I'll try my best!
You look like that thing!
So pathetic
Jing Jing loves my violent side
Having the personality again
Monkey King, come out!
Damn monkey
You said you would marry me
when I was 18
I have waited for you 3 years
You come out!
Our King is not here
He said give it Miss Pak
when you come here
and thanked Miss Pak very much
He can't enjoy it
500 years...
We've found the Longevity Monk at last
The hair on the sole has shaved off
I don't know when it will grow again
Shit! They come first!
I have to inform
these innocent people
You come back to Waterfall Cave again?
Waterfall Cave?
Who are you?
Why do you bring me here?
No one brings you here.
You come here on your own
t is normal to miss your home
Don't tease me!
My home is at Mt Wuyue
You have made a mistake,
can you hear me?
Don't annoy me, please!
We have to go, Master, or we'll be late
Go? What do you wanna do?
Robbery!
Who dare to do so?
We go to rob!
Ok, that's fine!
Go to rob...
What?
Rob the sole
I have no legs. What to do?
What are you looking at?
Are you jealous of my handsomely shaved face?
That's fine
Yes...
Jealous! You guys...
Shut up!
Grapes?
Master, the grapes are washed
Go out
The dinner is ready
Go out!
Who?
I'm the grapes that you bring here!
You're grapes?
No, I'm Grandma Ada?
What Grandma Ada?
Stop the non-sense.
I'm Grandpa Buddha, an immortal
I turned myself into grapes and save you
You stole my grapes
and forbid me mentioning Grandma
Both women are devils
If you don't believe me
you can use my Magic Mirror!
I use your Mom's mirror!
Say! Listen to me
Have you stolen my grapes?
No!
Where are my grapes!
I'm your grapes!
Louder!
I'm your grapes
Why aren't you an apple?
Listen to me
You shouldn't think I can't defeat you
I don't wanna hurt innocent people
Go out!
You will be seriously hurt!
Jing Jing!
Your beard looks great!
Really?
Why was it so noisy?
Just beating the grapes
Who're gonna beat grapes?
Meal time.
Meal time
That's great!
Great?
What a pretty moon. Let'...
Moon? I can't see it
There is a big moon. Can you see it?
It's not dark yet,
how come is there a moon?
Tell me...
Who? Who the hell...!
Who the hell?
I was turned into grapes
Where are you?
In your trousers
Big grapes!
It's yours. I'm at your back!
That's great to see you
You trust me now!
Yes, I trust you
Why do we have devil here?
Stupid fool, listen to me
These devils are waiting
for the Longevity Monk
Longevity Monk?
500 years ago,
Monkey King was destroyed by Goddess
His master Longevity Monk wanted to save him
He exchanged the monkey's life
with his own
He hoped this monkey would be good
Why does the Longevity Monk
need to appear?
he wanted to save the whole world
so he went to India and tried to get scriptures
he hoped they would do good to the people
All devils were impressed by his spirit
heaven Emperor saw that
He gave the monkey a chance to revive
He planned the master
and the disciple to meet here
Then they can finish the journey to the west
Now, you know why
there are so many devils here
You got it
So I am having the same
dream
In a pitch-dark area
a pair of seductive eyes
looking at me
make me embarrassed
Your eyes look like the eyes in my dream
Sometimes, my face becomes red
I have to face the devils tonight!
Yes! You are facing devils tonight!
Two Magic Bags here,
and some invisible stickers
You're invisible
if you stick one on your body
Cover him by it when he is not aware
I'll cover you up from the back
This is my line!
Whom are you talking to?
To him
Let me help you!
That's great! You're my good bro
Tell all bros to come in
give a magic sticker to each of them
I go back to get the Magic Bag
Then we can catch all the devils
No problem
Good brother
Your eyes today...
Are they seductive?
Yes
I will help you
Help yourself!
What to do?
It is Master's order
You wait a moment
Asst. Master
Tell the others, Master is looking for us
Go
Invisible sticker
Go...
Sister
OK....
Let's keep quiet and see what they want
Sister, drink!
Sister, you drink too
What are you doing?
I'm drunk. I wanna sleep
don't be afraid. We're invisible
You shouldn't drink so much
if you cannot drink
We're invisible
You can see nothing all the time
Ok!
Master hasn't come yet
Yes
You say there is roast chicken
Master! It's burning
Don't be naked.
Pay me back! Fool!
No need to be like that?
None of your business, pay me back
When did I borrow money from you
You owe me
I owe you?
Don't you remember?
No....
You lost your memory
Sorry
You should pay back!
No need to be like that
Pay me back, or I'll ruin your face
I have paid you back last month
Really? Yes, yes
You're old. You lost your memory
Forget it, it's my fault
Cut it! Cut it!
That's better zxa than nothing
Fight with him! Bros!
Bros, let's go!
Yes!
Devils, come out!
Where is the Magic Bag?
The Magic Bag is here.
They wanna frame you
Traitor, you betray me
Today, you betray me
I will betray you one day
Really?
Yes!
I want to destroy all devils
I can take off my underwear!
Master, there's really something
wrong with Asst. Master
That guy is unwilling to do anything
even if I beg him
Now, he admit so quickly.
There must be something wrong
Pull him out
Yes!
Let me go...
Let me go
Shut up
Let me go
Kneel down
You son of a bitch,
I'm gonna kill you tonight
Fine!
You can't blame him
He's only mesmerized by both devils
Let me go
or I'll tell my Master to kill you
Shut up!
Wong Choi
The string you're biting is so familiar
Stranger
It is the string for my Magic Bag
Son of a bitch
How dare you come here!
Come here!
I'll kill you, reincarnated Monkey King
Then you won't find the Longevity Monk
What?
He is the Monkey King?
Say you're the Monkey King
or we'll all die
He's not the Monkey King
He can't even withstand my Skeleton Fire
He is not the Monkey King
Shit!
You've exposed a top secret
Really?
This way
Are you really a fairy?
Give me your hand
It is too much of you...
Do you think I can't withstand
your Skeleton Fire?
Burn me again
Serious?
Great!
I'm not scared! See?
Yes!
You can burn my hand if you like
I'm not afraid of you
Not burn my hand?
Burning
The hand is still OK
Let go!
Now you know I'm great
Surrender!
I have got my bros and a fairy
Where are you going?
I'll take revenge on you one day
Even a fairy is not righteous
No need to ask
My bros must be there
Yes! Master!
Sons of bitches!
Are you that heartless guy?
You deceived me last night!
That Monkey King
Sister will not be married just
because of you
Me?
Get the Joker!
Go!
Stop that
Master, go
Don't kill my bros!
Master
Blindy, I'm here, no need to scare
Sorry, Blindy!
You have made a mistake
You won't blame me, will you?
For my whole life I know
I'm blind...
But I am right to be your follower!
Kill you!
You go to hell
You can't kill him
You still help him
You want to rely on him to find
the Longevity Monk
Take him back to Spider's Web Cave
Sister
Only one man can be benefit by it
You don't know this in fact
You won't gain anything even
if you hurt me
Look at your palm
Black Widow!
You've been poisoned by my weapon
You will die in 7 days
if you can't get my remedy
Sister, I don't dare to do so anymore
Get lost!
You regret at last
No! A fierce thing has come
Go out and have a look
Where are you going?
No!...
King Bull has come?
King Bull?
Pretend to be dead here?
Me too...
Monster
Granpa Buddha
Give the Longevity Monk to me
or you're gonna die
We have nothing to talk
You are looking for the Monkey King
My bro Monkey King?
Where is he?
This monster
is the Monkey King's Bro
We are saved
I'm you Bro
the reincarnated Monkey King
You?
Yes...
Yes! It's me
I'm gonna kill you adulterer!
Tell me your name, witch!
I'm Boney M of Spider Devil
Spider Woman
In the old days when I know your masters
where were you?
I have no business with you...
Change...
I'm going to kill
the ones who black my way
Try my White Bone Whip!
Change!
Dragon Heavenly Silk!
Go!
It's only small trick
Blindy, you're still alive!
We are in trouble
I admire you
Don't go...
Let me see what magic you have got
King Bull Go
My Little Buddha in hurt
Another hundred years before it is healed
Get up
What are you doing?
Master wanna see you
What place is this?
Spider Web Cave
Spider Web Cave?
Yes!
I'm Spider Devil's disciple Spider Woman
This is Spider Web Cave
Spider Web Cave?
Let's go! Monkey
Hey, you have gone mad
I'm your Master, monkey!
I'm mad
You are lying!
You've admitted that
you're the Monkey King
Go!
Get smart just for once
I was forced to pretend
you can use the Magic Mirror to
show my true identity
Magic Mirror?
Can you see it?
Yes
Clear?
Deceive me!
This is not the Magic Mirror
Pig!
Sister, have pity on me
Stay calm
I guarantee that you can trust
my word this time
Master!
Master! The monkey has come
Where is the Longevity Monk?
Big misunderstanding, everybody
How big?
Let me tell you secretly
I was born in the Year of Monkey,
but I'm not the Monkey King
A waste of time!
I have got the Magic Mirror and everything
You can use the mirror on me
Fake mirror
how dare you use the fake mirror...
Now! Stop playing game
If I'm the Monkey King
why am I standing here
for you to bite my hand?
I could jump to the sky
Then shit on your heads
You haven't changed to be
Monkey King yet
You'll shit at that time
What is it, sister?
Broken hearted?
No
No?
I won't be hurt by this man again
you are lying to me!
Sister, I'm not lying to you
Then kill him
Kill him
Don't you want to find
the Longevity Monk?
Yes! But I don't think you will kill him
Not accurate...
Give the sword!
Give! Understand
Kill him!
You've sliced a piece of my thigh out
I intended to do that
Give me a bill and I'll pay you back
You're welcome
I kill you!
Cheap whore, you still love that monkey
Stop that, I'm gonna kill you
Are you Ok?
You're still concerned about me
I'm gonna love forever onwards
They are outside
Can this door block them?
this door is mad of unbreakable steel
Stand aside
Sister, do you remember
how he treated you in the past?
He deceived you, refused to marry you
You had a good marriage with
Chilian Immortal
He ruined it
He can do nothing now
When he returned to his own image
he'll leave you
Have you finished? Son of bitch!
Damn monkey,
how dare you call me a bitch!
Scold me, son of a bitch
Don't think it's safe to hide inside
it's full moon tonight
She will become a zombie!
I don't scare, son of a bitch
What?
There are many hills and caves here
We don't know
where the Spider Web Cave is?
Yes...
More than the bugs in my body. Search!
What are you doing?
How about inside? Are you fine?
Of course I'm alright
We are very happy
Jing Jing is still very pretty
I'm still very handsome
We are still very good-looking
Meal time, Ma'am 30th
Help...
Zombie!
Open the door!
I can't open it!
Kiss her, breath life to her
Maybe it will be stopped
Scare me!
Sister, you can't defeat me
Really?
I'll break your neck if you move
Give me the key! Lock him up
You wanna go inside
Now you can go
Goodbye!
Please stop taking revenge
Listen to my suggestions
You can beat me,
but please don't hit my face...
Stop beat my cock, thanks
There is a chicken, Ma'am 30th
I'm telling you
No reactions after a kiss
Don't lock it up
Ok, since you refuse to open the door
I warn you
I'll rape and kill your lover
One
Two
I get it
Three
Seductive magic
Go!
What are you doing?
I have just shivered for a while
Very interesting
You shivered on my body?
Yes
Oh god!
It must be better if she's not a devil!
You're poisoned
You'll die if you don't cured
What for even if I'm cured?
Living long is meaningless
if you are unhappy
Your last few days will be great
if you're happy
If I tell you I'm the Monkey King
what do you think?
I will kill you
I'm not him
This is a magic mirror.
You should use it
You're not him, really?
I'm not
Don't you scare that I will kill you?
Yes, but I have no option
Because I don't want you to look at me
while you're thinking of another
I would like to kill you
You said living long was meaningless
if you were unhappy
Go ahead!
Yes, I'll
Shit! Who make this knot?
Let me do it!
Sorry, I don't mean it
You do it strongly
So I wanna do it with you
Although I'm not a righteous man
I won't take advantages from the others
I'm not used to do it at daytime
Let's wait till night
No matter when
call me if you need me
From now on
I'll be with you
Can you get him?
No
Go on
Damn!
I'm so pretty
But I have a baby with such an ugly man
Ma'am 30th
Shut up!
I will kill you if I'm not pregnant
Thanks
Why are you so happy?
Tell you...
Don't tell the baby
you're his father
What should I be?
His maiden
I'm a man. I can't be a maiden!
We bring him up
He don't know if a maiden is
a man or woman
That's right
I've found a guy just like you
It's you?
Do you wanna know
where the Longevity Monk is?
Yes, I do
Don't strike back if you do
you have to pay for the flesh of
the Longevity Monk
It worths!
If you give me the medication for Jing Jing
I will tell you
where the Longevity Monk is
You just do it for that bitch
I like to do so
Maiden
Maiden is kissing you
Ok, let's go by tomorrow
Because of love
you can ruin my face if you like
Hurry up, do you wanna save someone?
Just let me do it!
Joker
Sister can't take this anymore.
You go ahead!
Let me...do that
Not here
Everyone deceives me
We'll reach the Buddha Cave after
climbing this hill
No, Ah!
Jing Jing!
Jing Jing!
She thought I left her alone
How long will you search?
Jing Jing
She's poisoned, must have died and
fell down from the cliff
It's all because of you
You shouldn't let me sleep
for a whole night
I should come here as soon as possible
You should whip the horse strongly
We can be faster!
I won't tell you
where the Longevity Monk is
I don't know anything
How dare you put the blame on me!
What?
We discovered that
Boney M fainted under the cliff
Granpa Buddha has died
God is helping me!
Go in!
If you don't tell me
you can't go out
I won't listen to you
The ground is not so hard
Powerful devil, extraordinary energy!
I will cure your wound but
you must take me to the Cave to get
the incarnated monkey
We'll find the Longevity Monk
sooner or later
You can also eat the flesh of
the Longevity Monk
or you will die painfully
I have to come out
even if I have to dig a tunnel
I can move freely in time and space
with the power of moon
What is it?
This is the Indian language
The Pandora's Box
The treasure left behind by
Spider Web Devil?
Take me into the Cave
Why does the belly feel painful?
Is it coming?
Where am I?
Why so many traps?
It becomes wetter and wetter
Welcome, our King!
Damn! I've met a ghost!
What's going on?
You love the Longevity Monk
so I play him to make you happy
What are you doing?
I'm helping you to give birth!
The head is coming out!
Really, I've no feeling.
You see?
This is my knee
So there is no hair
Someone's coming
Hide up, be quick
I'm hurt
I'm hurt, too
Please let go of your hand! Alright!
Goddess
Monkey King,
you'd committed serious offences
I hope you know you're wrong
Who's talking?
500 years ago,
your master Longevity Monk sacrificed
his life to save you
Heaven Emperor planned that
you revive after 500 years
I hope you'll be like your master
Making sacrifices to save the others
To clean the sin that you've made before
You should put on the Gold Ring
on your head
Admit you sin
Then you'll become
the super Monkey King
You'll take the responsibility
to get scriptures in the west
Rewrite the history
All things in human life is then
none of your business
you can't have any desires anymore
Worship Buddha whole-heartedly
You haven't turned into the Monkey King
because you haven't met the guy
who gives you the 3 birthmarks
After you see him
your whole life will be changed
Talking to me?
I don't think so
I think you have made a mistake
Crazy!
Painful...
Let go!
Keep calm please No
Keep calm
I'm painful
I'm painful, too
Mind the traps here
Chase
Go!
Come her and grab me
Ok, do it...Ok! It's coming
The Longevity Monk was born,
go to get him!
Yes!
The baby looks like you
I think
being an immortal or not is not important
The flesh of the Longevity Monk isn't must, too
We have to live together happily
Bring our son up
Don't let him be robber
You want the Longevity Monk most
Just call him Longevity
Who?
It is too coincident
What do you want?
Your baby?
My baby with Joker!
What are you talking about?
Maiden, tell him
Tell him!
Yes!
this is her baby with Joker
Go!
See where you can go
No need to scare, I'm gonna protect you
Who the hell you are?
You're not qualified to protect me
Get lost
take my son away
Come here!
Give me the Longevity Monk
I'm not calling you to come
This is my son
not the Longevity Monk
Help!
Help...
You're concerned about me,
I'll die for you
Take my son away
Don't go!
Go
Ma'am 30th
It is lucky that we can go out
Jing Jing
Honey
Tortoise Magic
Slash your liver, stomach
and internal organs!
Tie it with a knot
"Here comes the spirit"

You're also very annoying
Wait...

Why did you do so?
Honey...
Boyi Bolomi...
Honey, come out with King Bull
and see Jesus
Stop!
Commit suicide
Why commit suicide?
No, I prefer killing you!
Hero!
You let me go!
Let you go?
Tell me a reason why I have to let you go
You tell me a reason why
you wanna kill me
Ok, you leave me alone
and you have a baby with my sister
No, that's not the case Wanna die?
No, hero!
I left because I wanna get medication
for you from you sister
But I was late
I couldn't find you
You deceive me!
You don't trust me
You look
Where have they been?
What's up?
You can't leave!
When the rock is put down,
the door is closed
Honey...
Let me do this
Go!
Joker, see you in the next life
Honey
Honey!
Honey...
Again!
Boyi Bolomi...
Jing Jing
Where are they?
What's going on?
Immortal?
Devil?
Thanks!
Don't go into the Spider Web Cave!
Spider Web Cave?
You think I'm illiterate?
Waterfall Cave
Spider Web Cave. It is a good name
Spider Web Cave
We'll live here onwards
Stop!
I wanna announce
In this hill, all things belong to me
Including you
Me?
yes
you look like a donkey,
let me make a mark on you
You're mine now
If someone bully you,
you tell them you know me
I'm called Spider Web Immortal now!
Spider Web Immortal?
500 years?
You haven't turned into Monkey King
because you haven't met the guy
having three birthmarks
Close the door
