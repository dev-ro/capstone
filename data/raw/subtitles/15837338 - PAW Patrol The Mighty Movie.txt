It's gonna be
a scorcher today, folks.
We're looking at a high of 98,
cooling down into the evening,
and we're forecasting
clear skies up and down
the coast,
which means Adventure City
should get a good look
at tonight's meteor shower.
You're listening
to Adventure City radio.

I'm coming. I'm coming.
J&H Scrap.
You bring us trash,
we pay you cash.
Oh, sure thing.
I'll get him.
Hank! Phone!
Okey-doke.
Bruce, when are you gonna
start answering the phone?
Living here
rent-free.
Yell-o. Hello?
Weird.
There's nobody there.
What do you mean?
I was just talking
to her.
Hello? Hello?
What on earth?
The door's locked.
There's
somebody
outside.
What? Where?
Look. Over there.
What are they doing?
Looks like
they're stealing
the crane!
Oh, my goodness.
They're heading straight
for the welding tanks!
Hello? PAW Patrol?
This is Janet from J&H Scrap.
The whole place
is burning down!
You've got to come quick!
All right, pups,
we've got a fire
at the scrapyard.
And by the sounds of it,
we don't have much time.
No fire's too big,
no pup's too small!
Skye, you are clear
for takeoff.
Let's take to the sky!
And away we go!
Pups, get ready to launch.
PAW Patrol is on a roll!
I've got eyes
on the fire.
It's a big one.
I'm going in for a water drop.
The entrance is blocked.
I'm gonna clear a way in.
Whoo! Bullseye!
Hot dog! It's the PAW Patrol!
They're gonna save us!
The PAW Patrol! Oh, Bruce,
you're gonna love them.
They're cute little puppies
who drive around in cars.
I know that sounds weird,
but just go with it.
All right, Marshall,
let's fight that fire.
Arf! Water cannon!
- Help!
- Over here!
Help!
Help!
Help us!
Marshall, the trailer's
on fire!
I'm all out of water!
- Oh, no.
- Incoming!
Yeah, Skye!
You see that right there?
That's why she's
my favorite pup.
PAW Patrol!
Let's get you out of there.
Whoa!
Oh!
Oops. Sorry.
And that's why
I wear a hard hat.
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!
We're just glad you're okay.
Hopefully there's not
too much damage.
Well, the good thing
is it was all junk
to begin with.
These are the brave pups
I was telling you about.
This is Bruce.
He's a sensitive soul.
This is all
a bit much for him.
Hey, let's get a picture
with Bruce and the pups.
Oh, great idea.
Janet, grab the little one
so she gets in the photo.
I'm fine down here.
Come here, sweetie.
Everybody say, "Junk."
Junk!
Ugh! I hate being
the smallest pup.
If she picked me up like that,
I'd have hit her
with the dog breath.
That trailer was locked
from the outside.
How did that happen?
Well, you're not
gonna believe this,
but somebody locked us up
so they could steal
our 10-ton electromagnet.
Who would want to steal
a 10-ton electromagnet?
It's showtime.
Hey, what's going on,
everybody?
I'm Sam Stringer here,
reporting live from
downtown Adventure City,
where we're about to see
the largest meteor shower
we've had in over 50 years.
Meteor! Meteor! Meteor!
Ah, I'm just so excited
to see the meteor,
Chickaletta.
As you can see,
it's meteor fever out here,
and everyone is turning
their eyes to the sky.
Meteor! Meteor! Meteor...
See any meteors?
All I can see
is your giant head.
Oops. Sorry.
Come on, Rubble.
You're gonna miss the meteor.
Do you really
expect me to watch
a once-in-a-lifetime
celestial event
without snacks?
Hey, Chase,
you have a rip
in your suit.
I do?
Yeah. Looks like
you're too big for
this thing already.
You're all growing so fast.
All of us? Even me?
Not yet, Skye. You're still
pretty much the same size.
But it's nothing
to worry about. All pups
grow at their own speed.
And some of us
never grow at all.
Oh, great.
They're here.
Come on up. Pups,
we've got company.
I'd like you to meet
the Junior Patrollers.
Nano.
Hello!
Mini.
Hi!
And Tot.
What's up?
When they grow up,
they want to be
in the PAW Patrol.
So I invited them to watch
the meteor shower with us.
You're Chase.
Uh, yep.
You're on the case.
I guess I am.
And you're Rubble!
Cool glasses.
Thank you.
Wow, Skye, I'm almost
as tall as you!
Well, I'm definitely taller.
But not for long.
Why don't you guys
check out the telescope?
Whoa!
My turn, my turn!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa!
Take it easy, puffballs.
This thing is expensive.
Oops.
Whoops.
Sorry.
Let's try that again.
Take a look through
the eyepiece and tell us
what you see.
Carefully look through
the eyepiece. Carefully.
I don't know about this whole
"Junior Patrollers" thing.
I mean, when did
the PAW Patrol become
a babysitting service?
Come on, Liberty.
Don't write them off
just because they're small.
Whoa!
Look at all the stars.
There must be
a billion of them.
We should count them all.
Okay.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...
Hello, world. Hello, universe.
Hello, Internet!
My name is Victoria Vance,
and I'm making
this video as proof
that I'm the greatest
scientist in history.
Oh, and don't
believe the rumors.
I'm not a mad scientist.
I mean, sure, sometimes
I act a little mad,
and I am a scientist,
but that doesn't make me
a mad scientist.
You got that? Good.
Now, I've been
tracking meteor X-2805
for the past two years.
It contains some kind of
power source
stronger than anything
we've ever seen on Earth.
Which brings me to my latest
invention, the Meteor Magnet!
Cool name, right?
This sweet little tractor beam
will pull that meteor
out of the sky
and gently deliver
it to my doorstep.
Now, let's get ready to party.
Whoo-hoo!
I've locked on to the meteor
and I'm reeling it in!
I did it. I did it!
Me. Victoria Vance.
To all the haters out there
who laughed at me
and called me a mad scientist,
who's laughing now?
Uh-oh.
No! No, no, no!
The meteor is stronger
than I expected.
I don't have enough power!
That is not good.
...3,034, 3,035,
3,036, 3,037, 3,038...
There it is!
Whoa.
I didn't think
it would be so bright.
It looks like it's headed
straight for us.
That's because it is!
Everybody out
of the pup tower!
Get those
people inside! Go, go, go!
Everybody out of the street!
You need to take cover
right now!
Take shelter!
The meteor's heading
straight for us!
Everybody inside! Get inside!
Oh!
Come on, buddy.
Get up. Let's go.
Get out of the street!
We don't have much time!
Clear!
Street's clear!
Clear!
Good job, pups.
Now take cover!
Get down!
Is everybody okay?
I'm okay.
I'm good.
I'm fine, but I'm gonna need
a serious bath.
Oh, my goodness.
Wait. Where are
the Junior Patrollers?
Nano? Mini? Tot?
Whoa!
That was epic.
I'm so glad nobody got hurt.
Oh, no. Look.
The pup tower.
It's completely destroyed.
Our home.
Our vehicles.
It's all gone.
That little thing
did all this?
This meteor is
giving off some kind of
strange energy pulse.
Let's get it out of here until
we find out what's going on.
At approximately 7:31 p.m.,
a meteor, which was meant
to safely pass by the planet,
suddenly veered off course,
crashing into Adventure City,
causing massive destruction!
I was there, people!
I almost got squashed!
Whew! Okay.
The mad scientist
Victoria Vance was arrested
after taking credit
for the disaster online.
I did it! Me.
Victoria Vance.
Yikes. Ooh!
That's an open and shut case.
You can't lock me up!
I'm the greatest scientist
in the world!
More like the maddest
scientist in the world.
I heard that.
I am not a mad scientist!
Hello, roomie.
It looks like
it stopped glowing.
Maybe that's a good thing.
The glowing freaks me out.
This will analyze the meteor
and tell us what it's made of.
We'll leave it scanning
overnight and see what
we can learn.
All right, pups, time for bed.
Argh, come on.
Need a little help
there, Skye?
Nope. No, I got it.
Good night, pups.
If you need me,
I'm just down the hall.
Ryder?
Yeah?
I miss the pup tower.
I don't like sleeping
in new places.
I'm never gonna be able
to get to sleep.
Well, we've all had
a long day. You're probably
more tired than you think.
See you in the morning.
Rubble, quit messing
with the light.
Rubble!
What is that?
Weird.
I didn't do it!
No way.
Whoa.
Whoa!
Whoa.
Whoa.
Looks like the smallest pup
just became the strongest pup.
All right, let's see
what this thing
can really do.
Whoa!
What's going on?
Is everybody okay?
I think I've got superpowers.
Whoa.
Whoa.
No way.
This is the weirdest dream
I've ever had.
Uh, Rubble,
you're not dreaming.
Oh. Then this is the weirdest
awake I've ever had.
Look at your paws.
Whoa.
It's some kind of fireball.
Well, that makes sense.
You're a fire pup.
I wonder what
your power is.
- Huh? Chase?
- Marshall!
Up here!
Hey, how'd you get
over there so fast?
Get over where?
Great. Now the clumsy pup
shoots fireballs
out of his paws.
Don't worry. I got it.
Dudes,
I'm one with the water.
Awesome.
Check me out.
I'm a walking magnet.
Huh?
Sorry about that.
Cool. I'm a wrecking ball.
Whoa, Rubble, are you okay?
Rock 'n' roll!
What's your power, Liberty?
That's a good question.
I'm trying to figure it out.
Okay, come on. Here we go.
Superpowers on three.
One, two, three.
Whoa!
Okay, okay.
It's not
the power of flight.
That's because
it's magnet paws!
Nope.
That's it.
I'm a superpowered
wrecking ball!
Yeah!
Whoo!
What's going on here?
I've got no powers.
What a rip-off.
Skye can fly.
Marshall can control fire.
Zuma turns to water.
It's like these crystals
amplify something about you.
But I'm just Liberty.
What's my thing?
Now that we're super,
we're gonna need a new name
for ourselves.
Why do we need a new name?
We're the PAW Patrol.
I know, but now we're more.
It's like we've got something
just a little bit extra.
Ooh! I know.
How about we call ourselves
"the PAW Patrol But More
With Just A Little Bit Extra"?
It doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue.
How about "the Mighty Pups"?
Ready for action,
Ryder, sir!
Whoa!
Chase, Marshall,
ready for launch.
Power paws!
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five, four...
...three, two, one,
go!
Power paws!
Skye, Rocky,
go!
Zuma, Rubble,
ready for launch.
- Did he say "lunch"?
- No, I said launch!
Go!
Uh, Ryder?
As you know, I didn't get
any superpowers.
So, I'm not totally sure
what to do here.
I've been thinking
about that, Liberty,
and I've got a very important
mission for you.
You do? Yes! That's what
I'm talking about!
Whatever you need,
anything at all, I'm your pup.
Great. I need you
to hang back and look after
the Junior Patrollers.
Oh, that's not a good idea.
Nope. Mm-mm.
I'm trying to be
more flexible,
but I don't know the first
thing about little kids.
Don't worry, Liberty.
You'll be great at it.
Mighty Pups are on a roll!
Ryder, come back!
I'm not built for babysitting!
Oh!
When we hear
the word "superpowers,"
we usually think of big-budget
Hollywood movies
starring overpaid celebrities
wearing tights.
But now we know
superpowers are real.
And the fluffy little doggies
who got them call themselves
"the Mighty Pups."
Help!
They got new powers,
new uniforms
and new merchandise.
To all the parents
out there, I'm sorry.
That was my meteor.
Those should be
my superpowers.
I can't stand
those little mongrels.
I can't stand
the PAW Patrol either.
That's what makes us
such perfect roommates.
Yeah, well, don't get
too attached.
As soon as I can find
my way out of here,
I'm gonna get
my meteor back.
Can you give us a minute?
I need to discuss
something in private
with my colleagues.
Okay, here's the deal.
The kitties and I
have been planning
a jailbreak.
We'll help you
fly the coop
if you promise to share
some of those superpowers
with me.
Do we have a deal?
I don't really have a lot
of options right now,
so sure, it's a deal.
It's only a deal
if we shake on it.
Ugh.
We all shake on it.
Ugh! Are you kidding me?
Excellent, excellent.
Sealing the deal.
Wonderful.
Now, if you'll direct
your attention over there,
I left you
a little surprise
in the toilet.
Yeah. No, thanks.
I'm good.
Don't be shy.
Lift the lid.
That's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.
It took me a lot
of hard work.
The Mighty Pups have
incredible superpowers.
Skye can fly, Chase has
super speed and Rubble
is a real-life wrecking ball.
Okay, no more messing around.
My superpower is fire paws!
Nope. Okay. Okay. That's okay.
It's super speed.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Thanks to
the superpowers contained
in the mysterious meteor,
these pups are truly
unstoppable.
Come on, Liberty.
Be flexible. Be flexible!
Adventure City simply
can't get enough
of these Mighty Pups.
Hey!
We were watching that.
That's the problem.
We're just sitting
around watching.
We might not have superpowers,
but that doesn't mean
we can't contribute.
I can't believe
I'm saying this,
but are you three puffballs
serious about joining
the PAW Patrol one day?
Yes!
Absolutely!
More than anything
in the entire universe!
Then you guys are going
to be my personal project.
I'm gonna teach you
everything I know,
and turn you into lean, mean,
fluffy little rescue machines.
Wicked!
...97, 98, 99, 100.
Your turn.
One...
One...
Yeesh.
You're running with the big
dogs now! No pain, no gain!
Let's do this!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ugh.
Come on! Move it, move it!
We're gonna take you
from puff to tough!
Is that all you got?
I thought you wanted
to be in the PAW Patrol.
I want to see you hustle.
Go, go, go!
You're lean, you're mean,
you're a fluffy little
rescue machine!
Take it easy, Liberty.
Remember, the Junior Patroller
program is just for fun.
And there's nothing
more fun than realizing
your full potential.
Huh?
I didn't say stop.
Move it, move it, move it!
Not much further.
We're almost there.
You said that
two miles ago.
Oh, stop complaining.
Just be happy
I broke you out of jail.
I'll be happy when I have
something else to look at.
We're here!
Ah!
The sweet smell of freedom.
Is that Humdinger?
What's he doing
out of jail?
It is me. And I hope
I can count on your support
in the next election.
Stop campaigning.
We're fugitives on the run.
Sorry. I forgot.
It's just so nice
to be reunited
with my adoring public.
Ha! I didn't vote for you.
Me neither.
You were the worst mayor
the city's ever had.
Hmm! This is why I hate
free and fair elections.
We just got to keep
a low profile
until we get those superpowers
from the PAW Patrol.
And how do you propose
we do that?
We give them the one thing
they can't resist.
There it is.
- Air Humdinger.
- It's perfect.
Oh, I've missed you.
I had nightmares in jail
about flying coach.
Are you sure you know
how to fly this thing?
Oh, don't worry.
Your tacky little jet
is in good hands.
I've been flying planes
like this since I was
in grade school.
Must have been
a good school.
Autopilot activated.
Now we just fly around
until the PAW Patrol
comes to rescue us.
And why would they do that?
Because of this.
Are you out
of your mind?
Whee!
What are you doing?
Now we're in trouble.
They'll have to come
rescue us!
That was your plan?
Uh-huh!
Now sit down and eat
some cashews while
I go yelp for help!
Stop, drop and roll!
Did you see that?
They're getting it.
These pups are legit.
I'm happy for you, Liberty,
but maybe it's time
for a break.
Do you guys want a break?
We don't need
no stinking break!
Ha-ha! That's what
I'm talking about, puffballs.
PAW Patrol.
What's your emergency?
Mayday, mayday!
This is flight HD9904.
We need immediate assistance.
Hang tight. We're on our way.
Skye, I need you
to fly up there and carry
that plane down safely.
Are you up for it?
I'm a Mighty Pup.
I was made for this.
We'll provide ground support.
Come on, pups.
Let's take to the sky!
The PAW Patrol is here!
Cut the engines and I'll carry
the plane down safely.
And here you are!
Humdinger?
It worked exactly like
she said it would.
Like who said it would?
Me.
My crystal!
It's like taking candy
from a baby.
Give that back.
Ooh!
You're a feisty one,
aren't you?
Catch you around, pipsqueak.
Buh-bye!
No!
Thank you for flying
Air Humdinger.
Whoo-hoo!
Ryder, come in.
This is Skye.
How's it going
up there?
It was a trap.
They stole my crystal,
I've got no powers and
this plane is going down.
Where are you right now?
I can't get a visual. Hang on.
Can you make it back
to the airport?
Negative. It's too far.
I need a place to land
this thing now.
Copy that.
We'll have to improvise.
Skye,
we're clearing a runway.
I need you to set a course
for Main Street.
Did you say Main Street?
Affirmative.
That's the busiest street
in Adventure City.
It's also the longest.
All right, pups.
We need to make a runway
and we don't have much time.
Let's move it, people.
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.
Chase, mark the runway.
All the way down.
Chase is on the case.
Arf! Flares!
I feel the need
for super speed.
This intersection is closed!
I've got a visual
on the runway.
All right, let's do this.
Close your eyes and listen to
the calming sound of my voice.
I'm on final approach.
Oh, no.
I'm going under!
Whoa!
Come on, baby.
Soft landing. Soft landing.
Oof! Okay, hard landing.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Now that's a nice parking job.
They're back.
Come on. They're back.
Awesome!
Yeah!
How'd it go?
Not good.
Come on. You guys
are the Mighty Pups.
How bad could it be?
It was a trap.
Skye's crystal was stolen.
Oh.
So, really, really not good.
Hey, Skye. You doing okay?
I can't believe
I lost my crystal.
It could have happened
to any one of us.
But it didn't.
It happened to me.
When I was born,
I was the runt
of the litter.
Do you know
what that means?
That you were
the smallest?
The smallest
and the weakest.
It's not easy
being the smallest.
You learn pretty early on
that everything's gonna be
harder for you.
When you're the smallest,
you're always picked last.
And sometimes
you're never picked at all.
Eventually,
I realized that
if I wanted a better life,
I needed to take matters
into my own hands.
No! Come back!
I've got you. It's okay.
Let's get you
out of the cold.
I shouldn't even be in
the PAW Patrol. Ryder didn't
want another pup.
And if he did,
he sure wouldn't have picked
one as small as me.
I had no idea.
When I had superpowers,
for the first time in my life
I didn't feel
like the smallest
and the weakest.
I'd do anything
to get that crystal back.
Amazing.
That's your best time yet!
Hey, Liberty.
Can I talk to you
for a second?
Okay, puffballs, take five.
Better yet, take zero.
Do some push-ups.
I'm telling you, Ryder,
these puffballs
are the real deal.
Liberty, we've got to end
the Junior Patroller program.
What?
It's too dangerous.
Skye's superpowers have fallen
into the wrong hands,
and we have no idea
what's coming.
But the puffballs can help.
Sure, they're little,
but I've heard you say,
"No pup's too small,"
like, a million times.
I know the Junior Patrollers
mean the world to you,
but for now,
we need to keep them safe.
That means we need
to send them home.
Do you want to tell them
or should I?
Tell us what?
Nano, Mini, Tot,
I've got some tough news.
I'm ending
the Junior Patroller program.
What?
- No.
- I'm sorry.
Hopefully, we can
start it again when
things are safe.
When is that gonna be?
I don't know.
Ryder, I'm sorry
I lost my crystal.
It's not your fault.
I never should have
sent you up there alone.
I just keep thinking,
if I wasn't so small,
I could've stopped them
from taking it.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
We're gonna get it back.
I've set the computer to scan
the city sector by sector,
looking for the energy
signature of the crystal.
Just say the word,
I'm ready to go.
Skye, I'm gonna need
you to stay behind
on this mission.
What?
You don't have
superpowers anymore.
But I have to do something.
My job is to keep you safe.
Until we get
that crystal back,
I need you to stay here.
That's not fair.
I'm sorry, Skye.
But my decision is final.
Try and get some rest.
Finally.
I wonder what
my superpower will be.
Ooh!
Ow!
Don't touch.
Ooh!
It tingles.
I have the power
to control electricity.
For someone who hates
being called a mad scientist,
this is not helping
your image!
I'm just gonna
stand over here.
This is incredible!
I can feel the energy
surging through me!
Stop that!
The static electricity
is ruining my moustache.
And look what it's done
to the kitties!
The problem with
the Meteor Magnet was
it never had enough power.
But now look at me.
I just need to make
a few modifications,
and I can give it
all the power it needs.
I'll finally be able to catch
all the meteors I want!
Why on earth do you need
more meteors?
You saw what kind of power
was in the first one.
Who knows what else
is out there?
Energy signature detected.
Energy signature detected.
My crystal.
If I'm gonna get
my crystal back, I'm gonna
need all the power I can get.
That's all of them.
I'll have these crystals
back before anyone knows
they're gone.
Gotcha. Switching engines
to stealth mode.
Oh, no, you don't!
Ta-ta.
Get back here!
Is that really as fast
as you can go?
Oh, do you need me
to slow down so you
can keep up, little pup?
Oh!
You're so predictable.
Let me out of here!
Not so super inside
a force field, are you?
Don't feel bad
for losing.
People have been
underestimating me
my entire life.
Thanks for the crystals,
though.
No!
Time to put all of
this power to work!
Ha!
This is incredible!
I can reach further into space
than ever before.
Stop! What you're doing
is dangerous.
People could get hurt.
And why should I care
about other people?
They never cared about me.
No matter how smart I was,
they laughed at me
and called me a mad scientist.
So, I took matters
into my own hands.
I promised myself
I'd never let anyone
make me feel small
and insignificant ever again.
I'm sorry that
happened to you.
Oh, what would you
know about anything?
You're just a dog.
I know what
it's like to feel small
and insignificant.
Like you have to work
twice as hard as everyone else
just to prove you belong.
That's why I risked everything
to get my crystal back.
But all I did
was make things worse.
Turns out I am too small
to make a difference.
Ooh!
That was good. I know
what you're trying to do.
We have a little
bonding moment,
I get all soft and blubbery,
then I have a change of heart
and let you go?
Well, it's never gonna happen!
Who are you talking to?
Ooh, is that Skye?
Humdinger.
She was kind enough
to bring me the rest
of the crystals.
Aren't they beautiful?
Now remember, we had a deal.
One of those crystals is mine.
Ugh! Fine.
A deal's a deal.
Oh! Oh! Ah!
Oh, my goodness.
I can talk!
I have so much to say!
Give me that crystal!
How do I turn this thing on?
Come on, superpowers.
Ahhh!
Wow!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Would you look at that?
Ooh, I always
knew I'd make it big
in Adventure City.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to pay a visit
to the PAW Patrol.
Those pups and I have got some
unfinished business.
Oh, no.
Ryder! Ryder! Ryder!
Skye's gone.
She took the crystals!
What?
Skye, this is Ryder. Come in.
Skye, this is Ryder.
Do you read me?
The computer found
the missing crystal.
She must've gone after it.
Oh, no.
Come on, pups.
Skye needs our help.
How are we supposed
to help Skye if we don't
have our superpowers?
Looks like we're doing this
the old-fashioned way.
Then I'm coming with you.
What was that?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Earthquake!
I don't think
that's an earthquake.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't my old friends,
the PAW Patrol.
Humdinger.
He looks different
than I remember.
I'm stuck!
- Gotcha.
- Go!
Spread out
and don't get stepped on.
Hold still
so I can squash you.
Get out of the road!
What kind of heartless monster
steps on an ice cream truck?
Ah, there's nothing better
than a day at the salon.
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.
Arf! Sidecar!
Hey!
Hey, I know you.
You're in the PAW Patrol.
I was thinking
maybe I should join.
I mean, not to do
the rescues or anything,
obviously,
but, like,
your social media
or whatever.
Hang on!
Sorry about that!
On second thought,
who needs a job?
Ew!
You're not
getting away that easy.
Ugh!
Get back here!
It's a dead end!
Turn around!
Looks like it's the end
of the road, PAW Patrol.
What do we do?
I don't know.
We're trapped!
Junior Patrol is on a roll!
It's the Junior Patrollers!
Ahhh!
What is that?
Get it off! Get it off!
Operation Allergies.
Go!
Ah... Ah... Ah...
Ah... Ah...
He's gonna blow!
Marshall, the crystal's
in his jacket pocket!
I'm on it.
- Got it.
- Oh, no, you don't!
Marshall!
Nobody messes
with Giant Humdinger.
Ow!
If you mess with the fire pup,
you're gonna get burned.
Ooh, that's a hot one-liner.
He's shrinking!
Ahhh!
Whoa! Whoa!
Humdinger,
you're going back to jail.
Oh, not again.
That's what I'm talking about.
Lean, mean, fluffy little
rescue machines.
Hop in, puffballs.
You ride with me.
Nice work, Marshall.
Let's take that crystal
and go get Skye.
So many meteors,
so little time.
Ooh!
Can't you read?
The sign says "keep out"!
Ugh!
Hello!
We're going door to door
selling Pup Club cookies.
Can we interest you
in a sweet and tasty treat?
I'm listening.
What do you got?
Vance is distracted
at the door.
Zuma, you're up.
Aye-aye, Ryder, sir.
We got plain,
sprinkles, caramel...
- No. No. Pass.
- Spicy ginger...
Ooh!
Surf's up.
So, we can't eat
chocolate, but we'll take
your word for it.
We'll take your order now,
and you will get your cookies
in six to eight weeks.
That seems
like a long time.
Skye? Skye? Where are you?
Zuma?
Oh, it's good to see you.
Time to bust out of here.
Power paws.
Oh, I don't think so.
Only one of you has powers!
Ha! You're no match for me!
We're a team.
When you go up
against one of us,
you go up against all of us.
Fine. Have it your way.
Chase!
Got it.
Marshall!
Coming in hot!
Rocky!
Look out!
Keep your hands off
our vehicles.
You tell her, Rocky!
Rubble!
Power paws!
Skye!
On it.
Oh, no, you don't.
Chase!
Look at me.
I'm... I'm stretchy!
That's my superpower!
I'm elastic and fantastic.
Uh, Liberty?
Can you please
get us out of here?
No problem.
Nice catch, Liberty!
I've been trying
to be more flexible,
but this is ridiculous.
All right, puppies,
playtime's over!
Give me back
that crystal!
Zuma!
Where'd he go?
Over here, dude!
You got to be
faster than that.
You can't hide forever!
Huh?
These crystals
belong to us, dude.
No!
It's time to shut down
that Meteor Magnet
once and for all.
Hey, Rubble.
Want to go for a ride?
Teamwork makes
the dream work.
No! No! Stop!
What are you doing?
Fire!
No!
Oh, yeah.
How do you like me now?
Victoria Vance,
you are under arrest.
Ooh!
You're in big trouble!
You'll have to
catch me first!
Where do you think
you're going?
You mangy mutts
think you're so smart,
but those meteors
are coming down whether
you like it or not.
She's telling the truth.
There's hundreds of meteors
heading straight for the city.
What have you done?
What can I say?
I guess I am a mad scientist.
Finally, she admits it.
Skye, I need you
to fly up there
and destroy as many
of those meteors as you can.
You still believe in me after
everything that's happened?
I've always believed
in you, Skye.
You're the reason I started
saying, "No pup's too small."
I'll give it
everything I got, Ryder.
Wait.
If you're going up
against those meteors,
you better take
all the power you can get.
We believe in you, Skye.
I won't let you down.
Let's take to the sky.
Okay, pups, we've got a city
to evacuate. Let's move!
Where are you?
There you are.
Activating targeting computer.
Let's do this.
Fire!
Time to turn and burn.
Oh!
I'm hit!
Skye, are you okay?
I'm fine, but I'm gonna
have to ditch my jet.
All right, space rocks,
what do you got?
There are meteors headed
directly for Adventure City.
Evacuate the area immediately.
I repeat, evacuate the area!
Keep moving, everybody.
Only bring what's
absolutely necessary!
Come on, Skye.
That's all of them.
The sky is clear.
No, it's not.
Skye, there's
a huge meteor incoming.
I don't see anything.
Wait a second.
Oh, no.
Skye, you've got
to get out of there!
I can't do that, Ryder.
I have to try.
Save yourself, Skye!
That meteor's too big!
No pup's too small.
No pup's too small!
No pup's too small!
Skye!
Skye!
Skye!
Skye!
Skye!
Wait. What's that?
Whoa!
You see that right there?
That's why she's
my favorite pup.
Yeah, Skye!
Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!
That was amazing.
I'm so proud of you, Skye.
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.
I don't believe it.
She did it. Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!
Way to go,
PAW Patrol!
Give it up for Skye
and the Mighty Pups!
We are the Mighty Pups,
defenders of Adventure City
and guardians of all
that's good in the world.
With these superpowers
comes a duty
to protect all those
who need our help.
Our promise is to always
do what's right
and stop at nothing
to keep the world safe.
Because even the smallest pup
can make
the biggest difference.
No rescue's too big...
No pup's too small.
