Hey, you know what?
Do you mind putting this on?
Why?
It's not that bad.
It's not. It's like...
It's like a handful of people.
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.
Chris, I think you're just gonna have
to suck it up and receive the love.
Mm-mm.
I'll shut it down
after an hour, okay?
An hour?
Dude, people have been waiting
20 years for this.
You don't think I know that?
- I'm aware of that.
- I know.
I know.
All right.
Surprise!
Hey, guys.
Oh, my God.
What're you guys doin' here?
I just went to get burgers.
What's the big deal?
- How you doing?
- Hey. Good to see you.
- Doing good?
- Great.
- This is my wife, Carol.
- Nice to meet you.
These are my boys,
Jimmy and Eric.
- Oh, honey.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.
- Welcome home.
You know, your mom really
wanted to be here,
but you know, she's afraid
to fly and everything
and Cliff could never make
the drive up from Phoenix.
What do you think
about a speech?
What do you think
about a speech, huh?
Right, speech.
Let's do it.
Can I get a 7-Up
or something?
Nobody drinks 7-Up anymore.
What about a beer?
God, excuse me.
You don't have to
apologize anymore.
You are a free man in America.
Look at this.
His first beer in 20 years.
And that rhymed.
And that rhymed.
If you want to keep clapping
for that.
All right. Here we go.
This is weird.
Um...
It's very strange and I feel
like I'm dreaming or something.
I don't even recognize
half of you people.
Um, I do wanna say thanks
for being here
and for not
forgetting about me.
And then also...
you know, for the people
who helped get me out.
I don't really know
what I can say...
I will say that I would like
to take a piss
in a private bathroom,
for the first time
in a really long time.
So can I do that now?
- Yes, you can.
- All right.
Chris is gonna take a piss in private
for the first time in 20 years.
Okay.
Oh, hey, everybody.
Chris' high school teacher,
Mrs. Beasley, is here.
You know, if it wasn't for you,
Chris would still be in jail.
Pooping in public,
Mrs. Beasley.
You saved him from pooping
in public.
What they did to him...
it wasn't right.
That wasn't justice.
He didn't deserve that.
And he didn't deserve the 20
years he's already served.
We don't know how
you did it,
but we can never ever
thank you enough.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Yeah. Well, it was
a long time ago.
The house isn't
even there anymore.
Yeah. Where are you guys?
- Hi...
- Hi.
Hi.
Hey. Hi...
- Hi, Chris.
- Hey.
We used to live next door
to you up on Hill Crest.
Right. Hi, Mr. Phil.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks...
Thanks for being here.
Oh, of course.
I'm sorry Tom couldn't make it,
but I wanted you to meet Hildy,
and then, she disappeared.
I don't know. But I'll make sure
she says hi before we leave.
You know, everyone
here is just so happy for you.
How does it feel
to be free?
- Great.
- Well, now you get out there.
Pursue those dreams.
You think you might
try college?
I don't know.
Um, maybe.
I don't know whether it's
possible right now,
but just, you know,
glad to be... here.
What do you think
you'll study?
Um... Maybe criminal justice
or something. I don't know.
That's great. Yeah.
You still have plenty of
good years in front of you.
Thanks.
You can do anything
you put your mind to.
Okay.
Excuse me one second.
Just a minute.
Please, let me in.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Are you Hildy?
Yeah.
I'm Chris.
I'm so sorry about this.
Oh.
It smells like
cotton candy and acid.
- Dude, close the door.
- You close the door.
Dude, I'm fucking sick, man.
What's wrong with you?
Are you retarded?
Okay.
Hi.
Holy moly.
You're real.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Holy mackerel.
You know, she's convinced
that my life is perfect,
and hers isn't,
and that, you know,
she has to work much harder
for all the same stuff.
You know, it's the same story.
And it happened
when we were kids.
You know, she was convinced
that my father gave us...
gave me more attention
than her,
and I was treated differently.
Anyway, she doesn't wanna hear
anything other than that, so...
I don't... I'm not even
gonna try anymore.
It's just not worth it.
I don't know why you would. It
goes bad every time you try.
Yeah.
Look at you,
sitting in my car.
I can't... I can't get over this.
Yeah.
I keep thinking that they're gonna
come and get me and put me back in.
Like, say they made a mistake
or something.
I bet.
But this feels good.
Out here.
So where is the,
um, present...
- you were talking about?
- Oh, shit.
Oh, I forgot.
So, this is the first time
I've ever done this.
But I'm pretty
proud of it.
Wow, that is...
so...
It's the worst thing
you've ever seen.
No, wait. It has...
its own charm.
I mean, this could
only be me.
Right?
Seriously.
Please, keep it.
- I can keep this?
- Please keep it.
- Thank you.
- I don't need it.
I mean, I realize I don't
need a picture of you anymore.
I mean, that's the best part.
I get to, like...
see your face in real life,
you know.
Like, whenever we want.
Oh... You know what?
I... think I have to go.
It's actually late... Wow, it's
actually much later than I thought.
I'm not out
this late usually.
Tom's probably waiting
up for me.
- Yeah.
- And I have to work tomorrow.
- So, I gotta take off.
- Okay.
Um, when can we
hang out next?
Oh... I don't know.
We'll figure it out.
All right.
So...
So she lights that shit,
taps him on the shoulder,
She hands it to him right
before it's about to go off.
Oh, my God.
You should have seen
the look on his face.
It's like he just got
a live hand grenade.
Oh, my God,
I was laughing so hard,
I almost puked.
Look at you.
You're looking
a little wind-blown.
What are you talking about?
What was that
devious little smile?
What devious little smile?
I just...
You know, I had a nice
weekend is all.
Something is happening
with you,
and I don't know what it is,
and I need to know, Carol.
Joanie,
English Department only.
What already?
It's just, um...
I think Chris has like
a little crush on me.
Oh, my God,
that's hot!
No, but, wait. I'm worried that
it's gonna affect his re-entry.
- You know...
- No pun intended.
Ha ha ha.
Anyway...
So?
What?
How do you feel
about him?
I... You know, it's Chris.
You know, he's great, but he was
my student, so I can't um...
I mean, of course I'm fond of him.
I mean, 20 years...
You can't help but get
close, you know? But...
I don't know. It's...
Anyway, I'm married.
Maybe Chris could be a little
wake up call for Tom.
Hmm? Pull his head out
of the sand?
Yeah.
I tell you,
that's what I need.
I need a little 38-year-old ex-con
walking around my living room.
Chris is looking for work.
Carol!
- Oh, gosh! But...
- That's funny.
Awful thing to say.
I can't believe
I just said that.
It's not funny.
I told you I kept everything.
Even your tighty whities.
All right, man. Oh!
Here. Before I forget.
Present from Mom.
All right.
- You good?
- Yeah.
He was so close to success.
Alright? So close to saving his love.
So, why does he turn back?
Why does he ruin everything?
With all of his power
as a musician,
all the perfection
of his talent,
he's still only a mortal.
And mortals are flawed.
We are all of us,
cracked vessels.
Hold on once second.
I'll be right back.
Hildy.
Hildy!
Here.
I may pay you a
visit at your place of residence,
or your place
of employment.
Such visits need not
be precipitated
by advance notice
of any kind.
These are the stipulations
as to movement and travel.
You are to stay within
Snohomish County.
A lot of guys get out
and think they're free.
But you're not free yet.
Not by a long shot.
Ted?
Yeah?
Um...
I'm trying to print this thing
and it went away.
Where is it?
Over here.
You go up here,
to "file,"
and "print."
Thank you.
Good night.
The cellular customer
you are calling is not available.
Please leave your message
after the tone.
Hello.
Hey, it's me.
Oh. Uh...
Hello?
Yes. Hi. Hi, how are you?
I'm good.
Uh, I was just...
wondering what you were doing.
Um... Just, uh...
you know, cleaning up after dinner.
What are you up to?
Um...
Not much. I was kind of
missing you a little bit.
I was wondering if maybe
I could see you.
Uh...
Well, that's nice.
Are you okay?
You sound weird.
Um, yeah. Can you hold on
one second?
Just hold on
one second.
Hey.
Hi, I'm sorry.
You just kind of...
caught me by surprise there.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I called your cell,
but you didn't pick up, so I just...
I called the home phone.
I hope that's okay?
How was your day?
Uh...
It was fine.
How was your day?
Uh... Good.
You okay?
Yeah, I don't know.
Um...
We got a bunch of
people over right now.
I'm actually sort of
hiding out in the garage.
You're...
You're in the garage?
Yeah. It's actually not bad.
I mean, I kind of
like it in here.
You know, maybe...
Maybe they're not
so bad, Chris. You know?
Yeah, I don't know.
It's just...
There's like one girl, and her
voice is, like, really loud and...
I don't know.
Well, maybe it wouldn't be
the worst thing
for you to meet
some girls either.
Yeah.
Of course, yeah.
I mean...
It's just like girls that hang
out with my brother. I mean...
I don't know.
I just think spending time with
people, um, would be good for you.
You know?
Give it an hour, okay?
And just see how it goes.
Just do it for me,
Chris, okay?
All right. All right.
All right.
I will do it for you.
Good night, Beasley.
Good night, Chris.
- Definitely did.
- No, I didn't.
- Katherine Donnley.
- Yeah, I know.
- I know, 'cause she's my older sister.
- Oh.
And I totally had the biggest
crush on you in Junior High.
- You're Lindy?
- Linda.
I remember.
Put these in your mouth.
Drink them hard.
Grab one.
Come on, Chris.
Pop two of these in your...
Guys, does Ted
have brain damage?
Definitely.
Dude, I told you.
I'm on parole.
I can't fucking drink.
These people know, but you
can't seem to remember.
Mm.
I got yours.
Hey, man.
- Slow down.
- We're done.
- Can you hold this for one second?
- Yep. Got it.
Okay, um, make a wish.
I'll take the shot
and make your dreams come true.
There's no ball
so there's no point in this.
It's just a game.
Hey, Connelly. What's up?
Shane wanted to drop by
to say hey.
How does
freedom feel, man?
Um, I'll see you guys.
Nice talking to you.
Cool.
Listen, I just wanted to say
face-to-face I'm sorry, all right?
I owe you one.
Whatever you want, whatever you
need, you let me know, okay?
Get the fuck off me.
Where are you going?
Fuck you, man.
Get out of my way, or I'll run
this shit through you, I swear.
He just came by to apologize and
say thank you. That's the only...
You're fucking friends
with him?
You're fucking friends with that
trigger-happy piece of shit?
I'm not good friends with him,
he's just...
You don't come to see me, and
you're hanging out with him?
Maybe I should have
narced on you both.
Are you okay?
What happened?
Okay, stop. What are you doing?
What are you doing? Stop.
Stop.
What are you doing?
I love you.
I love you
and I wanna be with you.
Chris, I can't. I'm married.
I have a family.
They're all in the house
right now.
I know. I know.
But I know you love me.
I know you need me.
Chris, I have to...
I have to be with my family.
I'm sorry.
Is that it?
You're just gonna
shut me out?
No, no. I...
We can be friends.
Chris, I think
we can be friends...
We're not friends.
I mean, you're the only person
I can talk to.
You're everything to me.
That's too much
pressure, Chris.
It's too much for me.
I know you feel that way
about me.
I know you do.
You told me I'm the only one
you can talk to.
I have to fix that.
- Why?
- Because that's the problem.
I have to save
my marriage.
I have to save my family.
I've been messing it up there
for too long, okay? Please.
I can't do this thing
where I can't even
see you or talk to you.
It was better before
when I was locked up,
we could talk on
the phone for real.
- Yes, I know. I know.
- This is...
- I know, I know...
- Fuck!
We can be friends, Chris.
I think we can be friends who...
who can take care of each other
and...
have each others backs
and stuff, okay?
How are we gonna
be friends?
I'm...
Am I gonna come over to your house
and hang out with your family?
Yes.
- Yes, Chris. That's what you're gonna do.
- What?
You're gonna come over,
and you can...
get to know Hildy, and you
can get to know Tom, and...
We can...
spend time together.
That's what friends do, okay?
You want that?
That's what you want?
What...
are you doing?
Uh... I was thinking maybe
we could...
I've got work
in the morning.
Oh, I know. I know.
Carol.
I can't.
You know, but the doctor said
it's not entirely physical.
I mean, we could try and...
You know, we don't
have to do it.
Carol...
Please.
Could you just let me
get some sleep.
Okay, sure.
Hildy, how many times do I have to
tell you to get dressed already?
He's gonna be here
any minute.
How many times
have I told you
I will get ready
when he gets here.
It literally takes me
30 seconds to get ready.
Jesus.
Hey, wait a second.
Come back here, Hildy,
I'm speaking to you.
So did I do something
to upset you,
or was there something
you want to say to me?
What?
It's just 'cause
I'm a teenager, Mom.
It's what teenage girls do.
Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come on in.
Okay.
Well, this is it.
Wow.
It's, uh, not much,
but, works for us, so...
It's very nice.
Hildy's getting dressed.
She'll be out in just a minute.
Hildy! Chris is here.
Oh, Tom is at a car show
in Everett,
so he sends his regards.
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.
That's a bummer.
Um... So, uh,
is that what I think it is?
Oh, yes. Those boxes.
That's your case right there.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
- Pretty glamorous, huh?
- It's a lot, like 80 pounds...
Yeah.
- ...stuff right there.
- Hey, hi.
Hildy, Chris.
Oh, hey.
Last time I saw you,
my head was in the toilet.
Right.
What's that?
At the party, you know.
Anyway, it's stupid.
What kind of toilets
do you guys got?
Is it good?
Is it in good working order?
I don't... really... know.
'Cause I'm picky about
what I throw up in.
'Cause I'm definitely gonna throw up, no offense.
I mean, I have a lot
of volume when I puke.
You saw, right? You saw.
It's gonna be,
like, explosive.
Okay.
Well, Carol's cooking, so you might
find out how good the toilet is.
- What?
- Hildy!
That was good. It's a little
mean, but it was good.
Yeah, it was a little bit mean.
But that's okay.
Wait, wait. What about Mr.
Watsey, and the Watse hump?
Is he still
five months pregnant?
- He's still there and still...
- Farting.
Oh, God, the flashlights.
- What?
- Oh, my God.
Figure it out, dude. Buy
some Gas-X or whatever.
Don Watsey has
a farting problem?
Oh, non-stop.
It's an epidemic.
- It's like a serious problem.
- So toxic.
Hey, who won?
Vince, of course.
He's here.
- Hello, sir.
- Carol's kid, in the flesh.
- Chris Connelly.
- Tom Beasley.
Nice to meet you.
Congrats
on your release.
Thank you very much.
Maybe now
I can get my wife back.
Just joshing you.
Let me get you
a plate.
No, no.
Don't bother.
Oh.
Generally they'd have hot dogs or some tacos,
but they didn't have squat over there.
You were in a car show?
Actually it was
a classic car competition.
My buddy, Vince,
won the big one.
He always does.
Can I be excused?
Sure.
So, how is the job hunt
going?
Pretty good.
Just starting out.
I hear it's pretty tough.
Carol asked me to check in
with the uppers at work,
but we can't hire
any ex-felons.
I appreciate that, sir.
Yeah. Maybe I'll enroll
in some classes.
You know, these days, everybody's
doing their business online.
eBay...
Gregslist...
- So...
- Gregslist? Craigslist.
And nobody knows
who's buying or selling.
Scary as shit
if you ask me, but,
in your case it might work
to your advantage.
I don't know.
I think that went well.
Right?
Yeah.
- So...
- You okay?
Am I okay? Yeah.
Yeah. I'm fine.
Yeah.
Okay.
So what are we doing tomorrow?
Bowling 10:00 a.m.?
We could get our nails done?
We're buds now. We gotta hang.
Oh, you know, I was thinking,
this is a...
You know, this is
a difficult time for you,
'cause you know,
you just got out
and you have nothing but time
on your hands, you know.
When I would talk to you,
you know,
couple of times a week,
that was kind of all
the free time I had, you know.
I have my job.
I have the family, um...
The guys
at Ending Mandatory Minimums
actually said they may have
another client for me.
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Can you believe it?
Who is it?
Who's the client?
Oh, I don't know.
They didn't say.
So you're gonna work with
them, like, full time?
No. No, no.
They...
They seem to think
I have kind of a, you know...
you know, knack for this,
so... maybe...
Who knows? Maybe I could, you
know, do some good in the world.
It might be a...
I mean, some more good.
- Yeah.
- More good in the world.
So, I don't know...
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah.
But we're just gonna...
hang out once a week?
That's it?
Um, you know,
I don't know.
Uh...
Okay.
All right. Okay.
We'll just have to...
We'll see, okay?
'Cause I don't know.
All right.
Well, thanks for breakfast,
I guess.
Thank you for coming.
Thanks for coming.
And I guess I'll just see you
when I see you.
Hey.
- Hey.
- What's up?
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.
Hey.
- How's it going?
- Good.
We're just doing bath time.
- Oh.
- You okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You just mentioned to come by,
so I looked you up and...
- This is great, man.
- Thank you.
The cul-de-sac
and everything.
Yeah, you know
how I do.
Um, so yeah, man. It's like a
crime scene in there right now.
We're just doing
bath time, and...
Baby's sick, so we're just
scrambling, but, um,
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah.
Yeah. I was just
gonna say hi, whatever.
Yeah. No, no, no.
What about later?
Are you free later?
- Yeah, uh, maybe.
- No!
Uh...
Yeah. Just, uh, text me.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Cool?
- Cool.
We could do that.
Hey, you still
got the bike, man.
- It's pretty strong.
- Yeah. That's the one, man.
- Cool.
- 20 years of rust.
- Cool.
- And counting.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Very cool.
- All right.
- All right. Well...
Cool.
- I guess...
- All right.
Get in there, man. It sounds
like your kids are drowning.
Yeah, I'm the one
who's drowning.
Help me.
- See you.
- All right.
Shit.
- Hey.
- Sorry.
What are you doing here?
I didn't know
you worked here.
- Yeah.
- Um...
I was gonna, um...
get some food or whatever. I just
realized I forgot my wallet.
So I'm just gonna
grab it.
Oh. I can hook you up.
What do you want?
No, I'm sorry. I don't
want you to do that.
No, seriously.
It's all good.
Really?
Corn dog?
Okay. You want some fries?
- Nah.
- Some cheese fries?
I'll put some fries in.
Hey, Courtney,
this is Chris.
- Hey.
- Chris?
Oh, yeah.
You called about the job?
Um, yeah.
Let me grab an application.
Um...
Mr. Watsey deliver
his baby yet?
If by "baby" you mean
"fart baby," yes.
Cute little eight pounder
in third period.
- Whoa.
- Yes.
That's a big one.
Yeah.
Thank you for your purchase.
Oh, thank you so much.
I owe you one.
You wanna fill it
out here, or take it with you?
Um...
I gotta go.
But, thank you.
And nice to meet you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hey, um...
I was wondering if you wanted
to hang out some time maybe?
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah, it's like...
family sort of...
Yeah. Cool.
Rad. Okay, um...
Well, you can put your number
in here and...
I'll text you.
Okay.
Um, I don't know if my phone
does the texting thing.
Okay. Well, I'll try.
But if that doesn't work, I can
call you on the telephone.
- All right.
- That's better.
- Rad.
- Okay.
- All right.
- Cool.
All right.
I can't believe
he killed a guy.
He's just a little
puppy dog.
He didn't kill anybody. He was
just there when it all went down.
Wrong place, wrong time
kind of thing.
It's fucked up.
Yeah.
He didn't even know the guy
he was with had a gun.
He was just trying
to get some beer.
Hey.
Hey.
Nice place you got here.
Thanks.
Come on.
All right.
You live here now?
Um...
not exactly.
All right.
I wish.
So, what is like
the most different?
Cell phones.
Smart phones.
Whatever everyone's
obsessed with.
And the texting, man.
I guess I'm gonna get used to it.
Jesus!
So did you get
a job yet?
Nope.
People do not wanna hire a
murderer for some reason.
Don't say that. You're
like the opposite of that.
My mom said that you tried
to save that guy,
and that's how you got caught.
You stayed back
while everyone ran off.
Yeah, but...
I was in for 20 years,
so it's like...
I'm learning that's how
people are always
gonna see me.
It's like the whole world
sees me as a criminal now.
So...
What was...
What was it like?
Was it scary?
You're just like
in there, you know.
I mean, it's like...
It's... It's...
It is scary.
How'd you get through it?
Your mom
is who got me through it.
Really?
Yeah.
You know, like,
first she just
kept being my teacher.
And like, you know,
she would
give me assignments and...
Ew!
Made me read books.
That's what cheered you up?
Seriously?
Yeah. I mean, it was
kind of amazing, you know.
It was like distracting me
from, like...
all the bullshit going on
around me, you know.
It's weird. It's like you're
describing someone I barely know.
Hey.
Your mom's incredible.
And there's, like,
nobody like her.
I mean, everybody faded away.
But she was there for me,
you know.
Even my own fucking retarded
family didn't give a shit.
What?
You can't say that word
anymore.
What word?
"Retarded."
It's not...
It's not cool.
Hey.
Hi.
Where were you?
Out.
Hildy, I don't want you out
this late by yourself.
I wasn't by myself.
Oh?
I was with Chris.
He came by work to apply
for a job, so...
Oh.
Okay.
Hey, Dad.
You okay with that?
Okay with what?
Our daughter alone
with a 40-year-old ex-con?
It's fine if you do
your charity work,
but I'd rather you not
bring it home in the future.
Tom, if we're gonna have
a serious conversation,
do you think maybe you could
turn the television off, please?
I'm done.
I got nothing more to say.
So then, I guess this is the
end of our discussion, then.
What's up, man?
Oh, my God.
Chris,
you should see this.
Chris. Chris,
come look at this.
I'm good.
Chris, come on.
What channel is this?
It's just Internet videos.
It's on your TV.
Yeah, but we used the WiFi
to get...
the computer stuff
on the TV.
Watch this.
Watch, for real, watch.
Watch this, watch this,
watch this.
All right,
I gotta go to work.
Dave is sick.
Okay.
I'll see you later, Chris.
You don't have to go anywhere.
You can stay here.
Chris, is it okay
if she stays?
Mm-hmm.
And I leave you
with this masterpiece.
Enjoy.
I'll see you at work.
All right. Later.
How long you been
working at the restaurant?
Couple of years.
You mind if I put
my feet up?
No, I'm fine.
So what are you into, besides,
like, Internet videos?
What do you mean?
Like books and stuff?
Do you read?
Yeah. I read books. Yeah.
What kind of stuff
do you read?
Mm...
Shakespeare.
Really?
Yeah. No, no.
You don't know
how to read?
So, what about movies
and stuff?
You like movies?
Yeah, I like movies.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
What kind?
Um...
I like the Saw movies.
You don't have to do that.
I know.
I'm just saying,
if Ted mentioned something,
or if he asked you to...
Jesus! Ted is not my pimp.
I didn't mean it like that. I
was just trying to make sure...
I'm sorry.
- I do what I want.
- I'm sorry.
Oh, God!
Oh! Oh!
Fuck! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
Hello?
Hi.
Hi. Are you okay?
I just, uh...
What's going on?
What's the matter?
Um... Yeah, I just had kind
of a rough night over here.
I just needed to talk
to my friend.
- I'm coming over.
- What?
- What? No, no.
- No, no.
No, I'm coming over.
You need me, and I'm coming.
No. Chris, don't come
over here.
Um...
Let's meet somewhere.
Um... Sorry about this,
but, uh...
something just came up,
and I gotta go.
Okay.
- I'm sorry.
- All right.
Is everything okay?
Uh, yeah. Um...
Uh, you can stay.
It's just I... um...
Could you just do the lock on the
doorknob when you leave, okay?
Is that cool?
All right.
I'll see you later, okay?
All right. I'm sorry.
Bye.
Thanks for coming.
I'm always here for you.
Oh, Jesus!
Chris, you scared me!
Oh, my God!
You can't do that.
- Why?
- You scared me.
Sorry, Beasley.
What's going on?
Um...
Not much. Just...
gonna go to a friend's house.
You wanna come?
Uh... I don't know.
It'll be fun.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hildy.
What are you doing?
This is your friend's house?
No.
Um...
Let's go.
We gotta go.
I just need one more second.
Uh... Dude, I'm on parole.
Oh, fuck.
Uh... Of course. All right.
I don't really wanna
talk to her.
Why?
'Cause she's...
She has no right.
I mean, she's been AWOL for the
past couple of years, and...
and all of a sudden she wants to
be my best friend? Fuck that.
That's kind of
my fault though.
To be fair.
You were just trying
to get out of jail.
Can I show you something?
Um...
This is...
This is unbelievable.
Has anybody seen this?
Well, you gotta show somebody.
I just did.
No. I mean,
somebody like important.
At least somebody
with a camera or something.
Whatever.
So, what's with this
party tonight?
Oh. Yeah, it's just my
dumbass brother's birthday.
Well... I should
come with you.
Mm...
Honestly, my house is kind
of a nightmare right now,
and I'd rather just be hanging
out at a party with you.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
You good?
Yeah, I'm good.
It's right over there.
I remember.
Oh, yeah. I forgot.
Hi.
- Hey.
- What's up?
- Cheers.
- Oh, thanks.
I think I'm gonna
have a beer.
I'm gonna have an actual...
- Really?
- Yes.
World is not gonna end,
you know.
Who's that?
She's a friend of mine.
You drinking?
You drinking a beer?
- Here we go.
- It's all right.
Oh! It's my birthday!
Everybody grab a drink,
except for Chris and the
teeny bopper over there.
But maybe we can get you like a Capri
Sun, or like a water or something.
But for the rest of your guys,
have fun, drink up.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it.
We have a toast to Ted.
- It's what we need to do.
- We don't need to do a toast.
Oh, yes, we do.
We need to toast
to my drunk-ass
little baby brother,
who let me rot
up in Walla Walla for 20 years,
barely came to see me,
and never said shit
about what he did, right?
To Tedster, right?
Mm!
Drink up, everybody,
come on.
It's a party. It's a
birthday party, everybody.
Hey, what's your fucking
problem, man?
What's your fucking
problem?
I fucking took the rap for
you, and you don't even...
It's like you don't even
give a shit about me.
Come on.
Fuck! Ow.
Oh, man.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God. Here.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Let's, um...
Hey, you wanna ride
on the back?
Okay.
We can pick that up
tomorrow, okay?
Okay.
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.
All right. Here we go.
It's gonna be wobbly at
first, okay?
Okay.
- Whoa.
- Here we go.
Here we go.
Okay.
Where have you been?
Oh, my God, Hildy.
What happened to you?
- What happened to her?
- She fell.
She fell off her bike.
It's fine, Mom.
Hildy, are you drunk?
- No. Stop.
- Hildy!
Did you get her drunk?
I didn't get her drunk.
I'm sorry.
What is wrong with you?
- She was drinking and I didn't realize.
- What were you thinking?
I was trying to help her.
Okay?
This is you trying to help?
Yeah. She's having
a hard time, okay?
She doesn't want to be in the house
with you guys, and I don't blame her.
Go home, Chris.
I will take care of my family.
Thank you.
- Put it down.
- What are you doing, man?
Fucking put it down.
What the fuck
are you doing here?
Put it
in the fucking bag.
Put the gun down
I'm gonna
fucking shoot you.
No, no, no, no!
Carol.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry
I let that happen.
That's your kid, and I was
supposed to be the grownup
and I was supposed to take care
of her, and I didn't do that.
And I let you down. And I'm really sorry.
And I feel horrible.
Okay.
Okay.
All right. Listen... Look,
I know I've been
a pain in the ass, all right?
But I...
This has...
This has been really hard.
This is like so much
harder than I thought.
I have an idea.
What if we just spent
one day together?
Just like one day,
where you can just be you,
and I can be me,
and we can be together. We don't
have to touch each other.
It's not even about that.
I feel like if I had that,
I could move on.
You know?
And leave you alone.
And, um...
If that's what you want.
Look, I know you're going to
Seattle this weekend, right?
I know the EMM stuff is super
important, but I just...
If you could just
skip it this one time,
just so we could spend
a little time together.
All right.
Look, just think about it. I'm gonna be
at the park on Friday, after school.
I'm gonna be waiting there,
all right?
Hi.
Hi.
Can I give you a ride home?
I have work, Mom.
Honey, you understand
why I was upset, right?
Are you gonna try to keep
me from seeing Chris, too?
He doesn't have a family.
He has no one.
I gotta go.
Huh? What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Oh, God...
I'm sorry.
You okay?
What's the matter?
Nothing. I don't know.
Just let me go, okay?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
I got ten minutes
What's up?
I think we need to
go to counseling.
You wanna keep
living like this?
Why do you keep
harping on this?
We've made it this far.
Well, this is shit, Tom. We're
living in shit right now.
Here's what I think.
I think we're living a normal
life, just like everybody else.
I'll retire
in about five years.
And then we can do
whatever we want.
See, this is why
we need counseling,
'cause there is
no communication.
Like, I don't even wanna retire.
I'd love the work like I did with Chris.
Like, that...
I'm good at that.
I like that.
Carol, that is what has
been dragging us down.
Down from what?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on a second.
It's too dangerous.
- What?
- They might recognize us.
Oh.
- Put that on.
- Oh, come on.
- Come on, put it on.
- Get out of here.
Chris...
Does it look like
I'm fucking around?
- All right.
- Let's see it.
Do I look as good
as I feel?
- All right. Let's do it.
- Yeah. All right.
We are totally freaking
everybody out here.
Come on, come on.
Go.
You first.
Not bad.
I won.
Oh, my God.
This is so good.
Okay.
Where to next?
I don't know.
It's getting late.
I don't know
how we could top that.
- That was pretty great.
- Yeah.
Um, well, what do you wanna do?
Um...
I know I said
I wasn't gonna, but...
I really wanna
kiss you right now.
Will it be okay?
I can't.
All right. Yes.
- I love you.
- I love you.
I love you.
You do realize that
I could be your mother?
Almost.
I'm gonna have to disagree
with you on that one.
My mother's not the least
bit attractive to me.
But seriously, how would
this work?
Have you thought
this through?
Yeah.
That's all I think about.
You have a whole, big,
new life in front of you.
Years.
How could you possibly know
that it's me that you want?
I've been feeling
all this pressure...
from myself mostly.
But...
From everybody.
You know, to...
do all these things,
you know.
To...
fulfill my potential.
But...
I just...
I just want a simple life.
I mean, I just...
wanna have a job
I'm good at.
You know,
come home every day
to somebody that I love,
and be good to them.
And, um...
watch television.
And, um...
maybe go for a hike every now
and again on the weekends.
I want you to be the
person I come home to,
and spend my life with.
'Cause I already love you more
than I thought was ever possible.
...a Blue Bird.
No, I never heard of it.
No? Maybe it was called
the Red Bird.
Or the Yellow Bird.
It was some kind of bird.
But they have the best pancake and the best
French toast, and the best everything.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Chris, you gotta
get out of here.
I'm not going anywhere.
Please.
Tom...
Tom, hold on.
Tom, hold on a second.
Hold on, one second.
Please, Tom. Oh, my God!
Stop!
Jesus Christ. Tom!
Oh, my God.
Tom?
Chris, go. Right now.
Get out of here.
You hungry?
Do you want me
to make you an omelette?
It'll take two seconds.
Yeah? Take a seat.
Hey, um...
I just wanna say
I'm sorry for being
such a fucking asshole.
I didn't...
I didn't know what to do.
I mean, you went to prison, and
then, you didn't say anything.
And I should've
visited you more.
I should've
visited you way more.
But I was afraid
if I went in there
and I said something, someone
would fucking hear me
and they could throw me in there.
It's stupid though.
No excuses.
I should have been there.
I should have been there
way fucking more.
I feel like such
a fucking piece of shit.
And there's nothing
I can do now, but, I...
I'm sorry.
You should take my truck.
What do you mean?
It's the only thing I have that's
worth anything. Just take my truck.
Please take my fucking truck.
I don't want your truck, man.
I don't even drive
a stick shift.
I'll drive you around.
How about that?
I can just drive you around.
I'll fucking drive you
for the rest of your life.
Hey.
Hi.
Uh... I'm calling because,
uh, Hildy was not
at school today.
She's not at work, and...
I don't know where she is,
and I'm starting to lose it,
and I'm wondering if maybe
you've heard from her,
or if you know anything
about where she is?
Um...
No, I don't know.
I'm sorry.
Shit.
Did you try the Jordan house?
What's that?
You know, the one that's on
the way out to Lake Stevens.
It's like burned out
or whatever.
She might be over there.
Wow. Okay.
All right.
Carol?
- I'm sorry.
- Chris...
Chris, I can't do this, okay? I
can't do this right now. Okay?
Yeah. No, of course.
Of course.
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.
Hi.
Hi.
So this is, uh, where you
been spending all your time?
It's really beautiful.
Hildy, honey, I'm...
I'm so sorry that you, uh...
Had to see that.
I don't know why your father felt it
was so important to have you there.
I'm the one who told him
where you were, Mom.
Your credit card
company called.
Suspicious activity.
So...
Are you guys, like, together?
No, honey.
We're not together.
That was the first
and only...
When Chris was in jail,
we talked... a lot, and...
I felt like I made
a difference in his life.
You know? That I was
important to him.
You were.
He told me.
Anyway, that's how
our connection started.
And I thought when he...
got out of jail, it would...
you know, be different.
That it would dissipate.
Well...
So...
what about you and Dad?
Honey, I don't know what's
gonna happen with me and Dad.
But I need you to know...
that you are the most important
thing in the world to me.
And it just kills me that I
hadn't been there for you
the way
that I should have been.
I'm hoping you'll give me
a chance to try to fix it.
I can't believe you did
all that work in there.
I'm...
I mean, I can believe
you did it.
I just can't believe that I
didn't know anything about it.
All right.
Here are your fries.
- Thanks.
- Bye.
You do it?
No.
Then why are you smiling?
- I'm not.
- Did you do it?
- I'm not.
- Chris, did you fucking do it?
I did not do it.
I'm just... I'm...
It's kinda cool.
Yes. Uh, in the middle
of my living room
there's a series of chairs
stacked up on each other.
It's together...
They put it together with some sort
of tape or something like that.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry to bug you
at work.
Is this a bad time?
No, it's okay.
I'm due for a break.
Um...
How are you?
I'm good. Um...
Got a job.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard.
It smells nice in here.
- Yeah, it's Timothy hay.
- Mm.
It's, um, it's the sweetest.
Um, how are you doing?
How is everybody?
Uh... Good.
You know, uh...
Hildy's talking to me,
which is nice.
That's good.
Tom moved out.
I'm sorry.
So I've been
thinking about you, um,
a bit over
the last few weeks.
I hear what you say about
wanting a simple life.
I get it.
I understand that.
Completely.
But, um,
that's what I've had.
You know?
You go to work,
you come home,
you have dinner,
you watch TV, you know...
I feel like I'm just
getting started.
I want more.
I loved the work that I did
to help you get out.
It felt important.
It felt like it mattered.
I felt like I was good at it.
I wanna do more of that.
Like I was...
I was thinking
when Hildy goes off
to college next year,
maybe I'll even
move to Seattle,
be closer to the offices
there and the work.
Why not, you know?
I'm...
I'm totally free now.
Wow.
I can see why
that can be so...
great for you.
I wonder, um,
would you wanna
have lunch sometime?
Maybe see if we can
try to get to know each other...
as we are now?
Yeah.
Of course.
