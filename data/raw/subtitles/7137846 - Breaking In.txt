Eyewitness News,
the Chicago area's leading news,
with John Brewery.
Prominent Chicago businessman
and real estate developer
Isaac Paulson is due in court today,
where he is expected
to be sentenced for his part
in a tax fraud and money laundering scheme
that robbed retirees and pension funds
of nearly $75 million.
Five bedrooms, tennis courts,
and almost 25 acres of woods.
What's an acre?
Mom?
It's a measurement of land.
Uh, it's like the size of someone's property.
- I thought Grandpa lived in the city.
- He did.
Uh, he kept this place as, like, a...
Like a vacation house.
So, why are you selling it?
Because it's part of the estate.
And that's what you do
when someone passes away.
But why are you selling it?
Because it reminds her of everything
she hated about her father.
Really?
What? That's what you said.
Just because your grandfather and I didn't
get along doesn't mean I hated him.
If you died, I won't sell our house.
Hmm. I would.
She's just ornery 'cause she was supposed
to see her boyfriend this weekend.
Whatever. He's not my boyfriend.
Then why did he make you
a playlist filled with sex songs?
Oh, my God. Shut up, freak. Mom!
Mom!
Seriously, I'm gonna kill you.
Okay, enough, both of you.
I know this is not how you wanted
to spend your weekend.
But guess what? Me, neither.
So, a whole playlist?
All right. We're here.
Grandpa had horses?
Mmm-hmm.
He sold them after I left.
You grew up here?
Mmm-hmm.
What do you think?
Seems lonely.
What's wrong?
I don't know. Stay here.
The power must've went out.
Hey, Jas, can you see
if you can turn that thing off?
I get first dibs on a bedroom.
Whatever. Nobody cares.
Hi, Maggie.
You guys get in okay?
Yeah, just a few minutes ago.
I hope traffic wasn't too bad.
No, we missed most of it.
Oh, good, good.
Listen, if it's all right with you,
I'll drop off the paperwork tonight.
We should be able to have the house
on the market as soon as next week.
Shaun, are you there?
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- Okay.
Well, I just want to say again how sorry
I was to hear about your father.
All right. Well, we'll see you tonight.
Thank God there's some cell phone service.
Girl, you just got
your phone privileges back.
Don't abuse them.
Listen, I'm gonna need you and Glover's help
this weekend to get the house ready.
What? I heard you.
Good. You can start by unloading the car.
Is that a request or an order, madam?
I am your mother. Is there a difference?
Now, please.
Thank you.
Mom...
Yes, Jas?
Never mind.
Hey. Hey.
Look,
it's not your job to worry about me.
It's my job to worry about you.
Okay?
All right.
Did I do that?
Glover, did you do that?
Glov?
Glov?
Glov?
Glover, is that you?
In here.
This place is a fortress.
What are you doing in here?
The downstairs windows have
retractable polycarbonate shields.
It's a fully automated security system.
Check it out.
There's cameras in every room,
the yard, the driveway.
Interior motion detectors,
exterior motion-activated lights,
electronic deadbolts.
Where's that music coming from?
This controls everything.
The music, the lights, the whole house.
It's so easy, even you could do it.
Hmm.
Awesome, right?
I guess some people get paranoid
in their old age.
So, what does that make you?
Nearly paranoid?
All right, smart-ass.
Find another place to play.
- Come on.
- I'm hungry.
I'll order a pizza.
That'll take forever.
I think you'll survive.
Hey. I'm still at the office.
Yeah, I figured.
Oh, looks like most of the weekend.
How was the drive?
Are the kids still alive?
- For now.
- How is it?
It's weird.
I bet. You okay?
Yeah. Tired, is all.
Well, listen, sweetheart,
the DA called this morning.
Justin, I don't want to do this, please.
- Shaun...
- No, don't.
I'm barely hanging on as it is.
He was the criminal, Shaun.
How could you have known?
From the moment your mom died,
you were on your own.
Your father needed someone
to blame, and he chose you.
You survived. You got out.
You built a family, a life.
Then why does it feel like I never left?
What he did, what he's done,
is not your fault.
You don't have to pay for his mistakes.
Babe, I just wanna get through
the weekend and come home.
You know I would be there if I could.
I know.
I should go.
- Sweetheart?
- Yeah?
You'll get through this.
Call me tomorrow.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Glover, go.
Jaye's Pizza. Hold, please.
Sure.
Oh!
Shit.
Glover?
Mom?
Glover?
Mom?
Glover.
I swear to God, if you're hiding some...
Let me go!
Oh, God!
Hey, hey, hey! Calm down,
and I won't have to hurt you.
Calm the fuck down!
Jaye's Pizza, what can I get for you?
Hello? Can I help you?
- Hello? Are you there?
- Help me!
Jasmine! Glover!
Fucking bitch!
Jasmine!
Jasmine! Glover!
Glover!
Jasmine!
Glover! Can you hear me?
Oh, God.
Oh! Oh!
I'm gonna get you out. I'm gonna get you out.
Move back! Move back!
Mom!
Mom!
I'm gonna get you out, okay? Okay?
Glover, I love you!
- Mom!
- I love you! I love you!
Okay? Okay?
Stop, right there!
Bitch!
She's the old man's daughter.
That's bad fucking luck.
Mom's. Found it in the garage.
She made two calls. One was to
the father, the other was local.
And Pete?
I don't know. He should've been back by now.
Did you call him?
No. He doesn't have a phone.
He thinks the NSA's listening
to him or some shit.
What do you wanna do?
I thought you said no one
came up here without the old man.
Yeah, that's the information I was given.
The information you were given?
I was banging the assistant.
It's not like I knew the guy.
You knew he stashed four million cash
in a safe somewhere in this house.
Or are you not sure about that either?
How about we ask the kids?
You know where the safe is, sweetheart?
They've never been up here. I told you.
The old man didn't talk to his family.
Clearly, you're a fucked-up tweaker
with inaccurate information.
- So, why don't you just shut the fuck up.
- Enough!
Come on, now.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Fuck.
Bitch!
A phone.
You have a phone.
The situation has changed,
but the objective's the same.
We find the safe, we get the money,
we get the fuck out.
What about them?
They seen our faces.
That's a problem.
- What are you saying, man?
- That we should solve the problem.
They're kids! Jesus, Eddie,
where the fuck did you find this guy?
I found him the same place I found you.
Doing three to five in county.
Only, he wasn't on his knees
in a shower stall.
Look, this is way beyond a break-in.
The minute we cut those phone lines,
the clock started ticking.
If we don't get them back
online in 90 minutes,
the security company's gonna call the police.
Yeah. You're right.
And Pete should've been back by now.
Maybe we should bail.
Can we open the safe without him?
No, we can't.
- What was that?
- The intercom.
Stay with the kids.
Hello.
Hello?
Who is this?
My name is Shaun Russell.
I don't care who you are
or what you're doing in my house.
Please, just let my children go.
Front gate.
You weren't supposed to be here, Shaun.
I'm sorry for that.
This has nothing to do with you or your kids.
Then just let them go.
Okay? We'll just walk away. No police.
No one will ever know. I promise.
I can't do that, Shaun.
But if you come back to the house,
I will not hurt your family.
Then why'd your guy try to kill me?
- Is he alive?
- I want to talk to my children.
I want to know that they're okay.
Not one word about my guy, okay?
We're not gonna hurt your mom.
We just wanna bring her back.
Mom.
Baby, are you okay? Did they hurt you?
- No.
- Your brother?
He's okay.
Mom, I wanna go home.
I know, I know.
Everything's gonna be okay.
- Mom, they're coming...
- Jas!
Now,
is my guy still alive?
Yeah.
Good.
That's very good.
What do you want?
I want you to listen.
I imagine, in this moment,
you're questioning whether or not
you and your kids will
make it out of this alive.
The answer to that depends
on who I am, what I'm capable of.
You're thinking, "If not me, then,
 "at least my kids.
"At all costs, "get them back,
no matter what I have to do."
But you know there is nothing you can do.
You are a woman, alone,
at the mercy of strangers.
Your greatest weakness is trapped here,
inside this house, with us.
We will work this out. I promise.
But from this moment on,
you are going to have
to do exactly what I say,
or you and your kids
will not survive this night.
Do you understand?
Do you understand me?
She's gone.
What about Pete?
I don't know.
Lotta fucking nature out here.
Find him.
Well, Duncan was right.
We do have ourselves a problem.
- What about the woman?
- The house is locked down.
She can't get within 15 feet
- without setting off the security lights.
- So?
So, when she does, we solve the problem.
Now, we're on the clock.
Okay? Right now, our priority
is to find that safe.
What if she goes looking for help?
We have her kids.
She's not going anywhere.
Take the kids upstairs.
Just calm down. Calm down.
I'm gonna remove the gag.
If you scream,
I put it back and walk away. You understand?
How many are there?
They're not gonna find you.
Not out here.
How much longer do you think
you're gonna last?
So, that's what you wanna do?
You wanna die tonight?
Help me. Please.
Four.
There's four of us.
What do you want?
A safe.
Somewhere in the house.
Are they gonna kill my children?
I don't know.
Hey. Listen to me.
I don't know you.
I don't know anything about you.
But these guys, they're for real.
So, if you let me go,
I'll take you back.
We'll figure something out, okay?
You got no other way out of this.
- Hey.
- You're right.
You don't know shit about me.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Where's Mom?
Hi, it's Maggie.
Maggie.
Let her go.
Get back to the house.
Shit! Shit!
Look, somebody's here.
Is it the police?
I don't think so.
Oh. Sorry. Hi.
I'm looking for Shaun Russell.
I'm Maggie Harris, the real estate agent.
Right. Uh, Shaun said you'd be coming.
She, um, ran into town to get some groceries.
Oh, isn't that her car in the driveway?
Yeah, she was having some problems
with it, so I let her take mine.
I'm Mark, by the way.
I'm a friend from Chicago.
I just came to help out with the move.
- Oh, she didn't mention...
- I'm sorry, do you want to come in?
You know, I don't want to trouble you.
It's not any trouble at all.
I'm sure if she knew you were here,
she'd come right back, you know?
For your sake.
I'm sorry?
It's just that you traveled all this way.
You might as well come in.
No.
Right?
Yeah, okay.
- She just left, you said?
- Yeah.
She shouldn't be long.
Um, actually, it's late.
I'm just gonna call her tomorrow.
- You're sure?
- Yeah.
Go, Maggie. Go.
All right.
Good night.
Help us!
Help!
Warm night.
911...
He killed her, didn't he?
We have to get out of here.
Okay, if we can get the lock open,
we can find a phone and call the police.
Glover?
We can't call the police.
They cut the phone lines.
I left my cell in the other bedroom.
Holy shit, man!
What the fuck happened out there?
I told you not to let her leave.
I didn't say cut her fucking throat.
She was just gonna walk, man!
What do you think is going on here?
We broke into this house.
We took those kids.
Cops come, and we're staring at 25 to life,
whether this bitch is dead
or tied up in the basement.
Moms didn't show.
I had to make a call, so I made it.
I didn't bring you on to make fucking calls.
Those kids upstairs,
that's all Mom cares about.
She would never do anything
to risk their lives.
She was afraid,
and that put us in control.
Now, any question that she might
have about our intentions is gone.
And that makes her fucking desperate.
So, what?
So, fear, I can manage.
Desperation, whole different thing.
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.
Of course, you don't.
From now on, just do as you're fucking told.
From now on, I'm gonna do
what I gotta do to get mine.
We have less than an hour before
the security company calls the cops.
If we don't find that safe,
nothing else matters, right?
What about Peter?
We find the safe, then we find Pete.
And Mom?
Did you understand a word I just said?
Clean up your fucking mess.
You want the arms or the legs?
Come on.
I think I got it.
Ow!
Shit. This isn't working.
We'll keep trying, okay?
Just see if you can find something smaller.
What happens if they find the safe?
Where is it?
Okay, what is this place? Fuck!
Fuck!
Shit.
What?
Maybe the information I got was bad.
Maybe there is no money.
The old man was under
investigation by the DA.
Liquidated all his cash.
You don't do that
unless you're gonna keep it.
I know.
But maybe the assistant was lying.
Maybe she was trying to impress me.
Somehow, I doubt that.
You know what I'm saying.
We did our homework.
The money's here.
It wasn't supposed to go down like this.
Yeah, you're fucking telling me.
What is it? What do you want?
He's a fucking psycho.
Don't worry about him.
Until he slits my throat, right?
Look, he killed that woman out there.
Now, if I'm Mom, I'm thinking...
I'm thinking no matter what I do,
I'm gonna be dead, too.
So, maybe I stay, before.
But now, I know I gotta go get help.
Moms don't run.
Not when their babies
are trapped in the nest.
Okay, look, you came to me.
You needed a crew.
Now, it's your turn.
So, go find the safe,
and stop wasting my fucking time.
Okay?
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Yo, Eddie!
Oh!
Holy shit!
She's shooting at us!
Is that Mom?
Those weren't gunshots.
She took out the lights.
We should've killed them
the moment they walked in here.
Here she comes.
Find her.
Where's the breaker box?
Back entry.
Go.
Come on. Come on.
What the hell?
That bitch.
Shit.
Son of a bitch.
Yeah, get back here.
She's in the house.
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait here.
- I'm gonna go get my phone.
- No!
- I'm gonna call the police.
- Please?
Glov, I'll be back, okay?
What if something happens to you?
I'm your big sister.
It's my job to worry about you,
not your job to worry about me.
Whatever, freak.
Phone, phone. Where's my phone?
It's me, baby.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
- Glover? Did they hurt you?
- He's in the other room, Mom.
- I'm so scared.
- I know, baby.
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna get your brother and we're gonna
get the hell out of this house, okay?
Okay, okay.
Was that them? Are they coming?
- They're gonna kill us, Mom.
- No, no, no.
I'm not gonna let that happen, okay?
- Mom...
- No, no, no.
- I'm not gonna let that happen.
- Shaun?
What if they can't get the safe open?
If they can't get what they want,
why would they let us go?
What do you mean,
"If they can't open the safe"?
That's what they said.
- Shaun!
- Are you sure?
All right, all right. You got it?
Mom. Mom, you can't leave us.
Baby, I promise you,
it'll be just for a little while.
Mom, no. There has to be another way.
Jas, listen to me. There is no other way.
You gotta take care of your brother, okay?
- Mom, I can't.
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
You hear me? You can.
Baby, you are strong, you're smart.
You are everything
I could have ever hoped for.
You're my daughter. You can do this.
Come on, Jas.
Where's your sister?
Hello?
Eddie?
Tell me the kids are still
locked in the bedroom.
Where is she?
Where is she?
I don't know.
She was in the house, God damn it.
- Tell me where the fuck she is.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All I have to do is push.
- Don't!
- Wait, wait, wait. Please.
Please, don't hurt us.
I'll tell you where the safe is.
You knew this was here the whole time,
and you're just telling us about it now.
Not exactly.
My mom told me where it was.
Did she happen to tell you the combination?
No.
But she wants you guys
to stop trashing the place.
Hello?
Nice. You found the safe.
What?
All right.
Let's go for a walk.
We'll use the kids.
Take 'em to the porch.
Kill the boy, and Mom will fall in line.
No fucking way, man.
We're not killing fucking kids.
You didn't have a problem
killing the old man, did you?
That was different.
Why? Because you weren't driving the car?
No. Because if the DA had investigated him
and he told them about the safe,
this whole thing would've been blown.
We didn't have a choice.
Thirty fucking minutes,
then the cops show up.
Either we do what's gotta be done,
or we turn ourselves in.
Why would she tell us where the safe is?
Who fucking cares?
She's smart, knows how to handle herself.
She knows about Peter.
Hello, Shaun.
You find what you were looking for?
I did.
Tree line. Side of the house.
There she is.
Gotta say, I didn't think
you'd make it this far.
Yeah. You and everybody else.
Growing up in this house.
The man your father was.
Guess I was wrong.
Still, you must be wondering
if I'm capable of killing this man.
And that depends on what you want
and what you're willing to do to get it.
You know exactly what I want.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be standing here.
Where are the other two?
In the house.
You're smarter than that.
Tell them to step out into the light.
You heard the lady.
Now, your friend here,
he's losing a lot of blood.
I don't know if you care about his life,
but I do know that you care
that he's the only one
who knows how to open the safe.
Listen, Shaun,
I want to end this as much as you do.
Great.
You tell my children to come outside,
and you don't touch them.
We'll walk into the woods,
and you don't follow.
When we're in the clear,
I'll let him go.
And how do I know I can trust you?
You don't.
But you know you'll do
whatever you have to do
because there's nothing else you can do.
You're a man at the mercy of a woman whose
greatest weakness has
a fucking saw to his throat.
Let her go.
Keep running, Shaun!
You just killed your kids.
Their blood is on your hands!
The assistant kept encrypted copies
of his codes at her apartment.
Peter runs a dummy protocol.
Peter wrote a new code
that'll bypass the safe security lock.
Theoretically.
How long is this gonna take?
Thirty seconds.
If it works.
We're in.
So, that's what the American
dream looks like.
Bag it.
Tie the kids to their beds.
Light the house on fire.
Just another family tragedy.
Hey.
To be honest, I don't like this
any more than you do.
But it has to be done.
And that bag you're holding
means life without worry,
from here on out.
No more 12-hour shifts.
No more sucking up
to those rich motherfuckers
who think they're better than you are.
No more being on your knees.
Don't look at them.
They don't matter. Look at me.
I said, look at me.
We good?
All right, let's get this done.
The fuck was that?
This bitch doesn't know when to give up.
Stay here.
You find her.
You cut her in fucking half.
Screw this bitch.
Shut up!
Shut up.
Shut up!
I said, shut up!
I'm coming.
Mama's coming. Mommy's coming, okay?
I'll be right there. I'll be right back.
Going somewhere?
No. I was just...
You were what?
There was... A noise.
Where?
I'm gonna drop the rope down, okay?
I'm gonna drop the rope down.
There's nowhere left to go.
Shit.
No, you... You don't have to do this.
The first time is the hardest.
You got what you came here for.
Just... You can just leave.
She's right.
There's no reason she has to die.
They all gotta die.
Go! Go!
You're not a killer.
You don't want to do this.
- Please.
- I don't know, man.
Do it, or you're fucking next.
Go, Glover, hurry.
Let me go!
Stop!
Last chance.
Yeah.
All right.
Relax, kid.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
"We tie the kids to their beds.
"Light the house on fire"?
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead already.
I wanna get you out of this,
but you're gonna have to trust me.
So, just relax, okay? Give me...
Give me the gun.
Put the gun down.
- Shoot him!
- Give me the gun.
- Shoot him!
- Give me the gun.
Jasmine! Glover!
Jas!
Mom!
Mom!
Keep running!
Go! Go!
Keep going! Run!
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
We're almost there!
Okay, get in. Go, Glov, hurry.
Put your head down, Glov.
Get down.
Mom!
Oh, God!
Get down!
Go! Go! Go!
Mom... Mom, front door.
Okay. Come on, come on!
Mom?
They got what they came here for.
They got their money.
- They're gonna leave us alone.
- Mom.
Mom...
I'm gonna get in the house, Shaun!
Okay, okay, come on.
I will get in that house!
We're safe now, okay? We're okay, now.
Okay. We're safe.
Okay.
Mom?
Just stay here, okay?
Oh, no. No.
No!
Justin. No, baby, no.
Shaun?
- Shaun!
- No!
Justin!
- Shaun?
- No!
- Shaun! Shaun! Open the door!
- Run! Run!
Open the door. What is going on?
- Open the door.
- It's been a hell of a night.
So, where are the keys?
Who are you? What do you want?
- Justin...
- Where are the keys?
My wife...
- Daddy?
- Kids, get back!
I know you can hear me.
Obviously, you can see me.
Open the door,
or I'm going to kill your husband
in front of you and your fucking kids.
You don't want to see him die.
Don't do it, Shaun! Don't listen to him!
Look, you're an impressive woman.
You've done everything you can.
You've done enough.
Mom. Mom, just give him the money.
He's gonna kill us anyway.
You don't know that, Mom. You don't know.
You gotta get outta here.
You gotta take Glover,
you gotta run as fast as you can.
- What?
- You run as fast as you can,
and you don't stop for anyone,
do you understand me?
Mom... Mom, what are you gonna do?
Open the goddamn door!
Don't you hurt my family!
I know what you're trying to do, Shaun.
This isn't gonna work.
You're done!
So, your plan was to draw me upstairs,
set the house on fire.
Sounds like something your dad
might have thought of.
Good plan.
The money is doused in gasoline.
You come any closer and I'll burn it.
You do that, you and your kids are dead.
And you walk away with nothing.
Or, I could just shoot you.
And the money burns.
After all this, is that what you want?
Shaun...
How far do you think your kids will get?
Your husband?
Now, you want me to believe
that you're capable
of letting your entire family die,
just so I don't get what I want.
After tonight, it's quite clear you have
no fucking clue what I'm capable of.
Me and everybody else, right?
Glover, wait. Wait.
Dad.
Drop it.
I meant what I said.
You're an impressive woman.
No. I'm not.
I'm just a mom.
Now, get the fuck out of my house.
He had it coming.
See, I was walking back here, thinking,
"Even though this bitch ran me over,
"see, I'm gonna make it quick."
That boy, too.
It ain't his fault.
But now, your girl...
See, I might have some fun with her.
Now, I'm thinking,
let's make it a family affair.
Where do you think you're going?
Daddy. Daddy?
Let go! Let go!
All night, trying to get back
into this house to save your kids,
only to end up trapped inside with me.
I wish I had a mother like you.
- Get up here.
- No, please.
Don't fight me.
Please, don't. No.
- Hold still.
- Please, don't.
- Relax.
- No.
No, you don't have to do this.
You don't have to...
- It'll be okay. Relax.
- Please.
- All I wanna do is push.
- Please. Please don't!
No! Please.
