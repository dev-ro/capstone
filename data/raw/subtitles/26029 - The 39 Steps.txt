A stall, please.
Ladies and gentlemen...
with your kind attention
and permission...
I have the honour
of presenting to you...
one of the most
remarkable men in the world.
- How remarkable?
- He's sweating.
And can you be surprised
at that, gentlemen?
Every day he commits to
memory fifty new facts...
and remembers
every one of them.
Facts from history, from geography,
from newspapers...
from scientific books,
millions and millions of them.
Think of the strain
involved by his prodigious feat.
His feet ain't
half as big as yours, Curly.
I'm referring
to his feats of memory.
Test him please.
Ladies and gentlemen
Ask him your questions...
and he will answer you
fully and freely.
Mr. Memory.
I also add, ladies and gentlemen
before retiring...
that Mr Memory has left his brain
to the British Museum.
A question please.
Ladies first.
Where's my old man been
since last Saturday?
- On the booze!
- In quod...
Out with his bit!
A serious question, please.
What won the Derby

- Next please.

How far is
Winnipeg from Montreal?
- You sir.

A gentleman from Canada.
You're welcome sir.

1424 miles.
- Am I right sir?
- Quite right.
How old's Mae West?
How old's Mae West?
Gentlemen, gentlemen
please, you're not at home.
What causes pip in poultry?
For God's sake play something
man and stop this panic!
Well there we are.
- May I come home with you?
- What's the idea?
Well I'd like to...
Well it's your funeral,
come on then, there's a bus.
- You don't stay here always?
- No, I've taken a furnished flat...
I'm only over here from Canada
for a few months.
By the way,
am I allowed to know your name?
- Smith.
- All right.
Do you want to know more about me?
What do you think I do for a living?
- Actress?
- Not in the way you mean.
- Chorus?
- No.
- Sorry.
- I'm a freelance.
Out for adventure, eh?
This way...
Sorry my sitting room's all upset
I've had the decorators in.
- Wait until I find the switch.
- Not yet.
Now.
Mr Hannay would you be so kind and
turn that mirror face to the wall?
You'd be happier if there were
curtains over those windows.
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.
Hello, there's the telephone.
Just a minute.
Mr Hannay don't answer
the telephone.
Why not?
Because I think it's for me.
Please don't answer.
Just as you say.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you. Would you please
kick that footstool over to me?
- You needed that.
- I did. Thank you.
- I owe you an explanation.
- Don't bother about me, I'm nobody.
We cannot talk here.
All right.
Just a minute.
OK?
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
- Your friend again.
- Take no notice.
Would you think me very troublesome
if I asked for something to eat?
- I've had nothing all day.
- Sure.
- Do you like haddock?
- Yes please.
I suppose your name
isn't really Smith.
It depends on where I am.
You may call me Annabella.
Annabella Smith,
a clergyman's daughter I'd say.
Hello, nervy.
Upset by those shots tonight?
I fired those shots.
- You what?
- Yes. To create a diversion.
I had to get away from
the theatre quickly.
There were two men there
who wanted to kill me.
You should be more careful
in choosing your friends.
- No you don't understand.
- You don't make it easy.
Beautiful mysterious
woman pursued by gunmen...
sounds like a spy story.
That's exactly what it is.
Only I prefer the word agent better.
- Agent? For what country?
- Any country that pays me.
- But what is your country.
- I have no country.
Born in a balloon.
Well, we'll let that go.
Now I suppose you're over here
to dig up some big state secret.
No I'm here to save a secret
from being dug up...
a very important secret
for this country...
not because I love England but
because it will pay me better.
You see a very brilliant agent
of a certain foreign power...
is on the point of obtaining a secret
vital to your air defence.
I tracked 2 of his men
to that music hall.
Unfortunately they recognised me.
That's why they're after me now.
That was too bad.
Have you ever heard of a thing
called persecution mania?
- You don't believe me?
- Frankly, I don't.
Go and look
down into the street.
You win.
- Are they there?
- Yes.
I hoped I'd shaken them off.
I'm going to tell you something...
which is not very healthy to know,
but now that they followed me here...
- you're in it as much as I am.
- What do you mean?
- Have you ever heard of the 39 Steps?
- No. What's that, a pub?
Never mind. But what you were
laughing at just now is true.
These men will stick at nothing
I'm the only one who can stop them.
If they are not stopped, it's only
a matter of days, perhaps hours...
before the secret
is out of the country.
Why don't you phone
the police?
Because they wouldn't believe me
any more than you did.
And if they did, how long
would it take to get them going?
These men act quickly. You don't
know how clever their chief is...
- clever and ruthless.
- Who is he? What's his name?
He has a dozen names and
can look like a hundred people.
But one thing he can't disguise.
This part of his finger is missing.
So if ever you should meet
a man with no top joint there...
- be very careful my friend.
- Thanks, I'll make a note of it.
- Meanwhile, what are you going to do?
- First, I'll eat my haddock. Then...
if you don't turn me out into
the street, have a good night's rest.
You're welcome to my bed
I'll get a shakedown on the couch.
Is there anything else
I can get you?
- A map of Scotland.
- Why Scotland?
There's a man in Scotland I must
visit next if anything is to be done.
Are the 39 Steps in Scotland
by any chance?
Perhaps I'll tell you tomorrow.
Clear out Hannay.
They'll get you next.
What you were laughing at
right now is true.
These men will stop at nothing.
There's a man in Scotland I must
visit next if anything is to be done.
It is only a matter of days.
Perhaps hours...
before the secret is out
of the country.
The police would not believe me
any more than you did.
I tell you these men act quickly...
quickly...
quickly.
Good morning sir. You're up
bright and early this morning.
- Could you use a pound note, brother?
- What's the catch?
- I want to borrow your cap and coat.
- What's the big idea?
- I want to make a getaway.
- Do a bunk?
- Yes.
- What have you been up to?
I'll have to trust you. There's
been a murder on the first floor.
- By you?
- No. By those 2 men out there.
Now I suppose they're waiting
for a copper to come and arrest them.
It's quite true. They're spies.
Foreigners.
They've murdered a woman in my flat
and now they're waiting for me.
Come off it. Funny jokes
at 5 in the morning.
All right, I'll tell you the truth.
- Are you married?
- Yes, but don't rub it in.
- What's the idea now?
- Well I'm not. I'm a bachelor.
- Are you?
- A married woman lives on 1st floor.
- Does she?
- Yes. I've been paying her a call...
and now I want to go home.
- Well what's preventing you?
- One of those men is her husband.
- Now do you see?
- Why didn't you tell me before?
I only wanted to be told.
Trying to kid me with a load of tales
about murders and foreigners...
Put this on, put on my little hat.
There you are.
- Take the pound.
- No sir, you're welcome to it...
You'll do the same for me one day.
Leave the pony round the corner.
- So long, old sport.
- Goodbye. Thank you.
The empties.
Papers, magazines, chocolates,
cigarettes...
There he is.
For one thing. They're much prettier
than they were twenty years ago.
- More free, free and easy.
- You're right there...
I can never understand how people
used to put up with the old sort...
all bones and no bends.
I will say for the old sort
they did last longer.
I dunno, mine last about a year.
Here I'll show you.
Big demand for these now.
- The old fashioned sort.
- My wife.
Now take a look at these.
Our new streamlined model no.1
- What I've been talking about.
- Anything to go with it?
I should say so. This. Put a
pretty girl inside those...
and she needn't be
ashamed anywhere.
- Bring it back to me when it's filled.
- I will.
Hello, what's this? Edinburgh,
Waverly. We're getting on.
I hope you'll pardon us
for talking business sir.
Certainly, certainly.
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.
- Broadminded old geezer.
- Bet he's very good at charades.
I wonder what won the 2 o'clock
at Windsor.
I don't know, let's get a paper.
Say, son, speeka da English?
Dispatch.
- Hello.
- Well, what won it?
There's been another woman murdered
in a West End flat.
- What?
- Woman murdered in West End flat.
Oh these sex dramas don't
appeal to me. What won?
- Batchelor's Button, 7 to four on.
- Oh, not so good.
Portland Mansions, Portland Place...
By the BBC. That's a nice place to
put someone to sleep.
Goodnight everybody,
goodnight.
That's a good one. What was she like?
One of the usual?
A well dressed woman of about 35
with a knife in her back...
- The Tenant Richard Hannay is missing.
- You surprise me.
At 7 o'clock this morning,
the charwoman Elisabeth Briggs...
- Well if that isn't the blasted limit.
- What's the matter now?
Is there no honesty
in this world?
I ask you. The new Bodyline
Rubber Panty Corset...
on sale today. McHutchen Brothers,
Princess St... Price 17/9d...
Brassiere to match 4/11 d.
Do you get that?
The bodyline, 1/3d cheaper
than our Streamline...
- no use going to Aberdeen now.
- Might I have a look at your paper?
Certainly.
- Thank you.
- That's all right.
There's enough evidence
there to hang any man.
What can I do for you sir?
Can you tell me what station
the train stops at next?
What do you think I am, a railway
porter? Go and find out for yourself.
- I'll tell you a better one presently.
- You couldn't. That was very funny.
Have you heard the one about
the young lady of Onga?
I can't remember them all.
There was a young
lady of Onga...
- Taking tea, sir?
- Yes. Thank you.
Darling, how
lovely to see you.
Someone having
a free meal in there.
I'm terribly sorry, I had to do it.
My name's Hannay, they're after me.
I'm innocent. You must help me.
I must keep free for the next 2 days.
Have either of you seen a man
passing in the last few minutes?
This is the man
you want, I think.
- But when we passed just now...
- He forced me and told me he was.
- Is your name Hannay?
- Are you coming into tea, sir?
I'll be right along.
Pull that cord!
Go on man, down that end.
Get on with it.
- Why did you pull the cord?
- To stop the train you old fool.
It's against regulations to stop
the train on the bridge.
- A man jumped off.
- A murderer, we've got to take him.
- Which way did he go?
- He must have jumped off here.
- I can't see him.
- I can't wait here any longer.
There he is getting on the train.
No that's a passenger.
- It's him I tell you.
- Come on then.
Extra, extra!
About 5 foot 10. small moustache.
Last seen wearing a dark suit...
but he may have obtained
a change of clothing.
- Good day.
- And to you.
- What'll your business be?
- I'm a mechanic looking for a job.
- You'll find no work about here.
- Are there no big houses round here?
Sir Andrews'. He won't want you. He's
had the same chauffeur for 40 years.
- I didn't know there'd been cars that long.
- He was coachman when he was a boy.
Oh I see.
What's that?
That's the Manse but the minister
hasn't got a motor car.
Are there no newcomers?
- Aye, there's an English professor.
- Professor?
He lives at Alt Na Shallach,
the other side of the Loch.
Would that be anywhere
near that village?
- It would.
- Thanks. I'll try there.
You won't try tonight,
it's 14 miles.
Do you think I could get a lift
in that van?
It's bound the other way.
I guess you're right. Could you put
me up for the night somehow?
- Free?
- No, I'll pay.
- Aye. Can you eat a herring?
- I could eat half a dozen right now.
- Can you sleep in a box bed?
- I can try.
- Two and six.
- Take it now. Thank you.
Go in with the gentlemen. He'll stay
with us until tomorrow morning.
Your daughter?
My wife.
- Will you not come in?
- Thank you.
Here's your bed.
I'll lift these things.
- Could you sleep there do you think?
- You try and stop me.
You'll be tired?
I'll say I am. Out on the tramp
looking for a job.
Sit down please, while
I go on with our supper.
Thank you.
- Have you been in these parts long?
- No. I'm from Glasgow.
- Did you ever see it?
- No.
You should see Saughiehall street
with all it's fine shops...
and Argyle street on a Saturday night
with the trams and the lights...
and the cinema palaces
and the crowds...
- And its Saturday night tonight.
- You don't get those things here.
No.
Do you miss them?
Sometimes.
I've never been to Glasgow, but I've
been to Edinburgh, and London...
I'll tell you about
London at supper.
- John wouldn't approve of that.
- Why not?
He says it's best not to think
of such places...
and the wickedness
that goes on there.
Listen now before he comes back.
What do you want to know?
Is it true that all the ladies
paint their toenails?
- Some of them.
- Do London ladies look beautiful?
They do. But they wouldn't if you
were beside them.
- You ought not to say that.
- What ought he not to say?
I was just telling your wife that
I prefer the town to the country.
God made the country.
Is the supper ready woman?
- May I look at your paper?
- I don't mind.
- You didn't tell me your name.
- Hammond.
Well Mr Hammond, if you'll put down
that paper, I'll say a blessing.
Yes, of course.
Sanctify these bounteous mercies
to us miserable sinners.
Oh lord make us truely thankful
for all thy manifold blessings...
and continuously turn our hearts
from wickedness...
and from worldly things
unto thee...
Amen.
I mind I forgot
to lock the barn.
There are police cars coming.
You best be going.
- I was so asleep.
- Don't let them catch you.
I'll never forget you for this.
Which way do I go?
I'll show you.
Aye, I might have known...
Making love behind my back...
Get out. And you too.
Get out of my house before I...
- Aye, go go.
- And leave you like this?
- It's your chance of liberty.
- You don't understand...
You're wrong.
She's only trying to help me.
- To bring shame upon the house.
- To help me to escape from the police.
- The police?
- They're after me for murder.
They're here. She came to warn me.
I told her about it last night.
Don't let them in. Say I'm not here.
I'll make it worth your while.
How much? Have you got
that much? Give it to me.
After they've gone.
Get back into the bed.
Shut him in. Hide him.
- No not there. I don't trust him.
- But he took the money.
He couldn't resist it, here...
I was right, he's asking if there's
a reward if you get catched.
He'll argue a moment before
he lets them in. Now's your time.
Your jackets terrible light coloured
I'm afraid they'll see you.
- You best take this one.
- Is this your husband's coat?
His Sunday best one. But
never mind. They mustn't see you.
- What about you?
- I'll say I couldn't stop you.
- He'll not ill treat you?
- He'll pray at me. But no more.
What's your name?
I'll never forget you for this.
There he goes.
Spread out in a line.
- Is the master in?
- What name shall I say sir?
He wouldn't know my name but ask
if he knows Miss Annabella Smith.
- Would you wait here while I enquire?
- Yes all right.
We better make enquiries.
Somebody might have seen him.
There's been a couple of cars here.
Murderers don't pay
calls in cars.
- Good day to you.
- Good day to you.
Have you seen any strangers
about this morning?
There's a few callers upstairs now
but they're not strangers.
You haven't seen any suspicious bodies
outside the windows or at the house.
No sir. There hasn't been anybody
near here for the last half hour.
- You're from Annabella Smith?
- Yes.
We're having a few drinks to celebrate
my daughter Hilary's birthday.
Give me 5 minutes to get rid of these
people and then we can talk.
Come along and meet my wife. Louisa,
another guest. This is Mr...
- I forgot to ask your name.
- Hammond.
Mr Hammond. He's come to see me on
business, all the way from London.
There's a police inspector at the
door. He wants to speak to you.
The door?
All right, all right.
I'll deal with this.
- Take him in my dear will you please.
- Come on...
This is Patricia...
Mrs Bailley.
Hilary my dear this is Mr...
Hammond, just arrived from London.
How do you do. Forgive the
orgy, we've all been to church...
the sermon lasted 45 minutes.
This is Captain and Mrs Ogilvie.
Have a drink Mr Hammond?
This is Derek, Derek Stewart...
And this is Sheriff Watson.
You've got to be polite to him.
He's our Sheriff substitute.
Scotch for a local beat.
Give you 6 months hard
as soon as look at you.
It's all right don't worry.
I've sent them away.
Come and look at the view from
this window Mr Hammond.
We're rather proud of it.
Sheriff, when are you
going to catch that murderer?
- What murderer?
- Haven't you heard?
The man who stuck a knife
into that woman in Portland place.
- He's in the district.
- How exciting, where?
Somewhere about. On the moors,
bridge of Orchy or somewhere.
Why don't you catch him?
You wouldn't like me to be stuck
in the back with a knife.
It's not my business.
You catch him and I'll convict him.
- Is there a reward?
- Gracious, it's nearly 1 o'clock.
We must get out of here.
The Professor wants his lunch.
There's no hurry. But if you must go.
Pat, ring for Captain Ogilvie's car.
Whenever you catch him you'll find me
at the court at 10 every morning...
so bring him along.
Louisa, forgive us, Mr Hammond and
I want to have a chat before lunch.
Now Mr. Hannay. I suppose it's safe
to call you by your real name now.
- What about our friend Annabella?
- She's been murdered.
Murdered?
The Portland Mansion affaire.
What are they looking for you for?
- I didn't do it.
- Of course you didn't.
But why come all this way
to Scotland to tell me about it?
I believe she was coming to see you
about some Air Ministry secret.
She was killed by a foreign agent
who was interested too.
- Did she tell you what he was like?
- There wasn't time.
There was one thing, part of his
little finger was missing.
- Which one?
- This one, I think.
Sure it wasn't this one?
- Lunch is ready dear.
- I'm coming right away.
Well, I'm afraid I'm guilty of
leading you down the garden path...
or should it be up?
I never can remember.
It seems to be the
wrong garden all right.
- What are we going to do about it?
- That's just the point.
What are we
going to do about it?
You see I live here as a respectable
citizen and you must realise...
that my whole existence would be
jeopardised if it became known...
that I am not, what shall we say,
not what I seem.
Oh Mr Hannay, why
have you come here?
Why have you forced me
into this difficult position?
I can't lock you up in a room. I've
my wife and daughters to think of...
I don't know what to think,
really I don't...
What makes it doubly important
that I shouldn't let you go is...
that I'm just about to convey some
vital information out of the country.
Oh yes, I've got it.
Poor Annabella would've
been too late in any case.
- Well, that's that.
- Yes, well what about it?
- What about what?
- About yourself...
- It seems there's only one way out.
- And what's that?
Supposing I left you alone,
with this revolver.
Tomorrow's newspapers could announce
that the Portland Place murderer...
- had taken his own life.
- I thought you were coming to lunch...
We're all waiting.
Will Mr Hannay be staying?
I don't think so dear.
Well, what do
you think Mr Hannay?
Well I'm afraid you leave me
no alternative.
I can't find my hymn book.
Where did you leave it?
In the breast pocket of my overcoat
it was hanging here.
John, I'm afraid I gave it to that
gentleman who stayed here that night.
Cigarette cases yes, but I've never
seen it happen to a hymn book.
This bullet stuck among the hymns.
Well I'm not surprised, Mr Hannay...
some of these hymns are terribly
hard to get through.
I'm not complaining Sheriff.
"Hymns that have helped me".
That's a good one, Mr Hannay.
That's fine.
And to think I was drinking his
champagne only half an hour before.
It's a lesson to us all, not to mix
with doubtful company on the Sabbath.
- How did you escape?
- Look out the window and you'll see.
They put... They body in
the dressing room.
When I came to I borrowed
this suit and pinched his car.
Sheriff, I don't want to hurry you,
but oughtn't we to be taking steps?
This is serious you know. If not,
you don't think I'd come to you...
- with a murder charge hanging over me.
- Never heed the murder Mr Hannay.
You'll convince Scotland Yard of your
innocence like you convinced me.
All I'll need is a short statement I
can forward to the proper authority.
I've someone coming over from
the police station to take it down.
- Are you waiting to see me Sheriff?
- Indeed I am.
Do you think I enjoy playing
for time with a murderer?
- Murderer?
- Certainly.
Hannay, you're under
arrest for wilful murder...
of a woman unknown in Portland
Mansions, London, last Tuesday.
Take him over to the jail.
You must believe my story,
it's true every word.
We're not so daft in Scotland
as some smart Londoners think.
Do you think I believed
your story about the Professor?
He's my best friend.
Get me Professor Jordan.
Where did that bullet come from?
From one of your pursuers
on the moor. Isn't that so?
I had a shot at
him myself.
Let me phone the High Commissioner
for Canada in London.
You better do that from London.
You'll be there soon enough.
It'll save you the cost
of a trunk call.
That's the Professor's
car all right.
Hannay must be inside
spilling the beans.
- Stop him there!
- My God!
How do you do?
We're all waiting for you.
Pamela's gone to meet you at the
station. This way, this way.
...From our respected leader and
standard bearer himself...
I welcome this opportunity to discuss
with you another question vital...
to the import of our country at
this critical and momentous hour.
But first of all, as a preliminary to
this, I shall occupy your time for...
- You've occupied too much already.
- We've had enough of you!
Ladies and Gentlemen, I will now call
upon the speaker of the evening...
Speak out!
There's no need for me to tell you
who he is or speak of his record...
as a soldier and statesman,
a son of Scotland...
- Speak out!
- The border and conquered England...
one of the foremost figures of the
diplomatic world in London.
I'm therefore going to ask him to
tell you something...
And about time too!
Important to this constituency
that at this crucial by-election...
our candidate should be returned by
an adequate majority.
I now ask for Captain Fraser.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I apologise
for my hesitation in rising...
but to tell you the simple truth
I'd entirely failed...
while listening to the chairman's
flattering description...
to realise he was
talking about me.
For you, may I say from the bottom of
my heart with the upmost sincerely...
how delighted and relieved I am to
find myself in your presence here.
Delighted because of your friendly
reception, relieved because...
as long, as I stand on
this platform...
I'm delivered
from the anxieties...
which must always be the lot
of a man in my position.
When I journeyed up to Scotland a few
days ago on the Highland Express...
over that magnificent structure,
the Fourth Bridge...
that monument to Scottish engineering
and Scottish muscle...
on that journey I had no idea that in
a few days I would find myself...
addressing an important political
meeting, no idea...
I'd planned a very different
programme for myself.
You'd be for the moors
to shoot something.
Yes, or somebody,
I'm a rotten shot.
Anyhow I little thought that I should
be speaking tonight in support of...
that brilliant young statesman, that
rising, the gentleman on my right.
Already known as one destined
to make his mark in politics.
Your future Member of Parliament,
your candidate, Mr...
- McCrocodile.
- He doesn't know the candidate's name.
I know your candidate will
forgive my referring to him...
by the friendly nickname by which
he's already known in anticipation...
in anticipation, mark you...
Westminster.
Now ladies and gentlemen, we'll
discuss some topic. What shall it be?
- The herring fisheries.
- Unemployment.
- What about the idle rich?
- The idle rich?
That's an old fashioned topic,
especially for me. I'm not rich...
and I've never been idle.
I've been very busy all my life...
- and expect to be much busier soon.
- Have you ever worked with your hands?
Indeed I have, and I've known what it
is to feel lonely and helpless...
and to have the whole
world against me...
and those are things that
no man or woman ought to feel.
I ask your candidate and all those
who love their fellow men...
to set themselves resolutely to make
the world a happier place...
a world where no nation
plots against nation...
no neighbour plots
against neighbour...
where there is no
persecution or hunting down...
where everyone gets a square deal
and a sporting chance...
and where people try to help
and not to hinder...
a world where suspicion and cruelty
and fear have been forever banished!
That's the sort of world I want.
Is that the sort of world you want?
That's all I have to say,
goodnight.
- I did what I could for you.
- You're a difficult man to follow.
- I guess you think you've been clever.
- Tell your prisoner not to insult me.
- You try and stop me.
- Come along.
Couldn't you realise I was telling
the truth in that train?
You must've seen I was genuine.
Whether you believe me or not...
put a telephone call through to
the High Commissioner for Canada...
and tell him that
an enormously important secret...
An important secret is being taken out
of the country by a foreign agent.
I can't do it myself because of this
fool detective. Has that penetrated?
Right to the funny bone,
now tell me another one.
Haven't you any sense at all?
Put that call through...
I beg you refer them to me.
Will you do this?
No. Goodnight.
I beg pardon Miss but we should like
you to come too.
- Whatever for?
- To identify the prisoner formally.
Will you come to the police station?
It's only for a few minutes.
All right, if it's absolutely
necessary, lets get it over.
Now you...
- Must I sit next to this man?
- It's just a moment.
Well, be as quick as you can.
Isn't that the police station?
You past it.
You must've misunderstood me.
We're going somewhere else.
- Where are we going?
- To Inverary.
- Inverary?
- Yes.
This man is to be questioned
by the Sheriff Principal.
- We've orders to take him there.
- But not to take me.
I'm afraid you must go. You'll be
sent back at the earliest moment.
- How far is it to Inverary?
- Forty miles.
Will you keep quiet?
We'll be there in less than 2 hours.
I'm not going to spend
the night with you all.
Looks like it.
Isn't he going the wrong way?
That's the way to Inverary.
There's a bridge down on that road. We
have to go round. He knows the way.
- Might I see your warrant?
- You shut your mouth.
You'll see it soon enough
when we get to the station.
Like to have a small bet
with me Pamela?
All right I'll have it with you
Sherlock. A hundred to one that...
your Sheriff Principal has the top
joint of his little finger missing.
What about it?
I win.
Hello. What are we stopping for?
Oh it's a whole flock of detectives.
They're all over the road,
get out there and clear them away.
- What about him?
- I'll soon fix that.
There miss, now you're
a special constable.
- What's the idea? What do you mean?
- As long as you stay, he stays.
Yes, and as long as I go,
you go. Come on!
Stop them!
They've got away.
- Come on, we must run for it.
- I won't.
See if they've gone down
that way.
Where the devil can
they have gone?
Help!
Let me go, let me go!
Shut up or I'll shoot you first
and myself after.
There's nobody down
here I tell you.
Then come up here, don't waste any
more time. Spread out and find them.
They must be
a mile away by now.
Don't do that.
Oh do stop whistling.
Why are you doing this?
What chance have you got tied to me?
Keep that question for your husband.
I admit you're a white man's burden.
I know and I can't tell you
what comfort that gives me.
What is the use? Those policemen will
get you as soon as it's daylight.
- They're not policemen.
- When did you find out?
You did it yourself. I didn't known
that was the wrong road to Inverary.
They were taking us to their boss,
God help us if they ever catch us.
I see, you're still sticking to your
penny novelette spy story.
Of the 20 million women in this
Island I've got to be chained to you.
Listen, I'm telling you the truth.
I told you on the train...
and after that election meeting. I'm
telling you now for the third time.
There's a dangerous conspiracy and
we're the only people who can stop it.
Think what you've seen happen right
here under your very nose.
- The gallant knight to the rescue.
- All right.
Then I'm just a plain
common murderer...
who stabbed an innocent defenceless
woman in the back...
how do you come out of that? I don't
know how innocent you may be...
but you're a woman, defenceless and
alone on a desolate moor in the dark.
Manacled to a murderer who'd stop at
nothing to get you off his hands.
If that's the situation you prefer,
have it my lovely, and welcome.
I'm not afraid of...
For all you know I may
murder a woman a week.
So listen to a bit of advice.
From now on, do every single thing
I tell you to do, and do it quick.
- You big bully!
- I like your pluck. Come on.
We're going in there.
That's my business.
Now remember what I said,
the civil tongue, or else...
We're going in there and you will
back me up in everything I say or do.
- Has that penetrated the ivory dome?
- Only just.
Pull yourself together now.
Put your hand in my pocket...
and look as if you're in a hurry.
Come along.
Come in man, come in sir.
Oh the young lady's terribly wet.
Yes, we had an accident with
our car a few miles back.
- Oh, you'll be staying the night?
- Yes.
We've just the one room left with the
one bed in it. You'll not mind that?
No, quite the reverse.
- You're man and wife I suppose?
- Oh yes.
- Yes.
- Have you any luggage?
No, we left that
behind in the car.
Well maybe I could lend the
young lady a nightgown.
Will you please register?
James, the book.
I'll away up and light a fire.
Will you be needing your supper?
No, thank you. Just send up a large
whisky and soda and a few sandwiches.
Oh, and a glass of milk.
I can't write with my left hand my
dear but I can shoot with it.
You can guess
what's in this pocket.
You sign, the sooner you get used to
writing your new name, the better.
Off we go, Mr and Mrs Henry Hopkinson
The Hollyhocks, Hammersmith.
Now dearie, off with that wet skirt,
I'll have it dried in the kitchen.
Oh don't bother. It'll dry
in front of the fire just the same.
No doubt the gentleman will
take care of you. Good night sir.
- Good night man.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Is he married to her do you think?
- I don't know and I don't care.
They're so terribly in love
with each other.
I'm going to tell them
the whole story.
You want to hang me for
a murder I didn't commit?
So long as they hang you.
Let me go! I'm not going
to spend the night here?
Of course you are,
what else can you do?
Can I come in sir?
Come in.
We were just getting warm
before the fire.
I can see that. I thought maybe you'd
like this in your bed, sir.
Thank you. You'd like
a hot water bottle my sweet?
- Say "Yes darling".
- Yes darling.
- Very well.
- Please don't go!
Why not?
Is anything wrong?
Of course not, she wants
to tell you something that's all.
We're a runaway couple.
I knew it all the time,
and they're after you?
You won't give us away will you?
Please.
Of course we will not give you up.
Good night to you both.
You'll not be disturbed.
Thank God for a bite to eat.
Come along. There you are.
- What's next on the programme?
- Get these things off.
Right. How are we going
to set about it?
Anything in that bag of yours? A pair
of scissors or hairpin or something?
A nail file if you
think that'd help.
It'll take about 10 years
but we can try.
Now let's make ourselves
as comfortable as possible.
What about that skirt of yours?
It's still pretty damp you know.
Don't want to be tied to a pneumonia
case on top of everything else.
- Take it off, I don't mind.
- I'll keep it on, thank you.
And that, is that.
My shoes and stockings are soaked.
I'll take them off.
That's the first sensible thing
I've heard you say.
- Can I be of any assistance?
- No, thank you.
Fine.
- Here hold this.
- Yes.
Half a minute.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
- Would you like your milk now?
- No thank you. I'll wait a little.
That's better. Now are your feet
quite warm again?
- Yes, thanks.
- Well come on.
Will you kindly place yourself
on the operating table?
Nobody's going to hurt you.
This is Armistice day.
- Lets get some rest.
- I'm not going to lie on this bed.
You're chained to me,
you'll lie wherever I lie...
- we're the Siamese twins.
- Don't gloat!
You think I'm looking forward
to waking up and seeing your face?
Unwashed and shiny?
What a sight you'll be.
Give me that nail file.
Lets have a go at this.
Thank you.
I wish I could get that damned tune
out of my head...
I wonder where I heard it.
- You sound very sleepy.
- Sleepy! I'll say so.
Do you know when
I last slept in a bed?
Saturday night. Then I only got
a couple of hours.
- What made you wake? Dreams?
- What do you mean?
They say murderers
have terrible dreams.
Only at first. Got over that
a long time ago...
when I first took to crime I was
quite squeamish about it.
- I was a sensitive child.
- You surprise me.
Used to wake up in night screaming
thinking the police were after me...
but one gets hardened.
How did you start?
In quite a small way, pilfering
from other children at school.
Then a little pocket picking,
car pinching, smash and grab...
and so on, to plain burglary.
Killed my first man when I was 19...
In years to come you can take your
grandchildren to Madame Tussaud's...
- and point me out.
- Which section?
It's early to say, I'm still young.
I'll be in one department or another.
Yes, you'll point me out and say:
"Chicks, if I told you how matey...
I once was with that gentleman, you'd
be surprised". What's the matter?
You're pinching my wrist
with this handcuff.
Sorry. Talking about Madame
Tussaud's. That's how it all began.
- What began?
- My career of crime...
all hereditary,
Great Uncle Penruddock.
Who was he?
Where were you brought up? Never
heard of my great uncle Penruddock...
the Cornish Bluebeard?
Got it all from him.
I thought your family came
from Canada.
No that's where they went
after the Penruddock incident.
Murdered 3 wives and got away with it
but his third mother-in-law...
got the goods on him and
tried to have him arrested.
Did she succeed? No.
He was too quick for her.
Took her for a walk to Land's End and
shoved her into the Atlantic Ocean.
He's in Madame Tussaud's and there's
no doubt about his department.
You must go down to see him sometime.
Can't mistake him...
Third on the left as you go in,
red whiskers and a hair lip.
And that lady, is the sad story
of my life...
poor orphan boy,
who never had a chance...
are you still set on
giving me up to the police?
You're sure everything's
going to be quite all right?
Bound to be. He can't have much time.
As soon as I've picked up...
You know what, I'll clear out
of the country.
Be careful.
Wire to me.
- Good bye my dear.
- Good bye.
Is that Professor Jordan's house?
Can I speak to Mrs Jordan then?
Is that Mrs Jordan?
Oh, he's gone to London.
I'd like that whiskey hot.
I'll get the hot water.
He dodged down a side street.
The police took the wrong way.
The girl handed him over to us
thinking we were detectives.
We had to take her as well
because he told her everything.
Very good ma'am, I see.
Yes, ma'am.
- Well?
- The old man's got the wind up.
- He's cleared out already.
- Whatever for?
Thought it too dangerous
with Hannay on the loose...
he's warning the
whole 39 steps.
Has he got the, you know?
Yes. He's picking up our friend at
the London Palladium on the way out.
Here's your toddy.
That'll be half a crown.
- And the phone call.
- We'll say a shilling.
- Is this a hotel as well?
- Aye.
- Do you have people staying here?
- Aye.
I suppose you get a few odd people
at this time of the year?
Oh, aye.
You didn't happen to have anyone in
tonight, did you?
Aye.
They weren't by any chance
a young couple, were they?
James!
Mercy me! What kind of a silly
creature am I married to?
Want to get us all jailed?
How much did you take for these?
Half a crown.
Out the pair of you. Don't let on that
you got a drink here after hours.
You old fool you. You wouldn't have
given away a young couple.
Good morning.
What's the idea? How did we
get out of these?
You didn't. I slipped out
of mine last night...
and camped out here.
- Why didn't you run away?
- I did, but as I was going...
I discovered you've been speaking
the truth so I decided to stay.
What earthquake caused
your brain to work at last?
I overheard those men
telephoning.
- What did they say?
- A lot of stuff about the 39 steps.
Go on.
Someone's going to warn them.
How can you warn steps?
Go on.
There was another thing, someone's
got scared and is clearing out and...
Oh yes, he's picking up someone
at the London Palladium.
The London Palladium?
Is that the Professor? Our friend
with the little finger missing.
What does he want
to go there for?
I feel such a fool,
not having believed you.
Oh that's all right.
We ought to get a move on.
What room are those 2 men in?
No room. They went as soon as
they had telephoned.
They what?
- Didn't I tell you?
- You let them go?
- You little idiot!
- Don't talk to me like that.
4 or 5 precious hours wasted.
Why didn't you wake me up?
You should've realised
what they said was important.
They've called these men off
why not let well alone?
Let well alone? My good girl,
I'm accused of murder.
The only way I can clear
myself is to expose these spies.
You still can. He's going
to the London Palladium.
First or second house?
I'll get there 5 hours late.
- The show should just about suit you!
- What's that?
Crazy Month!
You're quite right madam.
The Air Ministry has a new thing
lots of people are interested in...
but they are positive that
no papers are missing about it...
that would be of any
use to a spy.
I'm quite sure. There's a man leaving
the country tonight with something.
Since you phoned from Scotland
this morning we've made enquiries.
- It's obvious I'm wasting my time.
- Just a moment please.
There's one thing you
haven't told us.
Where's Richard Hannay?
I haven't the faintest idea.
- Now look here, you can't...
- You're in the phone book, aren't you?
Well if anything crops up we'll give
you a ring. That's all now. Thank you.
Tell Archer and Seagrave to get
another taxi and follow that girl.
She'll lead us to Hannay alright.
Cover every exit and on no account
let anyone leave the building.
You 2 go in the orchestra pit.
Ladies and gentlemen.
We shall now sing.
No one's allowed
to leave the theatre.
Can't a man
go out and get a drink?
My seat's in the stalls. I'm looking
for someone. May I go through?
She's seen him. She's on her way
down to the stalls now sir.
Can I borrow your
opera glasses?
Can I take your
place please?
What are you doing here?
Listen, he's in that box.
You can't do anything,
I've been to Scotland Yard.
Nothing's been stolen
from the Air Ministry.
But you heard those men
and there he is.
Shall we take him now sir,
or wait until the interval?
What are you going to do?
Nothing's taken and that's the end.
Do you hear that tune? The damned
tune I couldn't get out of my head.
Now I know where I heard it before.
That music hall, Annabella Smith.
Ladies and gentlemen...
with your kind attention
and permission...
I have now the honour
to present to you...
one of the most remarkable
men in the world.
- The same little man.
- Every day...
he commits to memory 50 new
facts and remembers every one.
Facts from history, geography, from
newspapers and scientific textbooks.
Millions and millions of them,
down to the smallest detail.
Test him ladies and gentlemen.
Ask him any question...
I've got it. Of course
there are no papers missing.
All the information
is inside Memory's head.
Mr Memory.
- But I still don't understand.
- Don't you see?
The details of that Air Ministry secret
were borrowed and memorised by...
and then replaced before anyone could
find out. That's why he's here tonight...
to take Memory out of the
country after the show.
Some gentlemen here
would like to speak to you.
A question please,
a question please.
- When did Florence Nightingale die?
- What is the height...
- There's something you must know.
- OK, Hannay. Come quietly.
You don't want to cause trouble
and spoil people's entertainment.
What are the 39 Steps?
Come on, answer that.
What are the 39 Steps?
The 39 Steps is
an organisation of Spies...
collecting information for...
Keep your seats.
Keep your seats, please.
There's no need for alarm.
No cause for alarm.
I don't want a chair.
Let me rest here. I'm alright.
Take it easy.
Get the girls on straight away.
The girl's introduction right away.
What was the secret formula
you were taking out of the country?
Will it be alright me telling you?
It was a big job to learn it.
The biggest job I ever tackled and
I don't want to throw it all away.
It will be quite all right.
The first feature of the new engine
is its ratio of compression...
represented by R minus one over R
to the power of Gamma.
Gamma seen in end-elevation,
axis of the 2 lines of cylinders...
angle of 65 degrees.
Dimensions of cylinders as follows.
This device renders the engine
completely silent.
- Am I right, sir?
- Quite right old chap.
Thank you sir.
Thank you.
I'm glad it's off my mind at last.
