Don't touch the phone when you drive.
My exam grades came in.
-Keep your eye on the road!
-Wait. I am.
So what did you get?
-No.
-Why not?
Guess.
I don't know. 90?
Close. 63.
No, seriously.
I'm serious. 63.
What do you mean, 63?
How did you get 63?
Dad.
Layla, your eyes.
Your eyes.
At least I tried?
God help us if you don't try harder.
Oh, really.
Stop.
Hello.
Greetings.
Congratulations on the wedding.
-I'll see you there.
-I'm coming.
-You're covered in dust.
-Great.
-Your mother's gonna kill you.
-Me?
Stop it! My dress.
Next time I'll teach you
how to bypass.
Really?
When?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Nothing, huh?
Go tell Mom we're here.
I think she already knows.
I know, I'm late.
Wait.
-What is it?
-You can't go in now.
-Why not?
-There are women in there.
I have to put the bed together.
Layla.
-Lift it higher.
-I am.
Then higher.
That's the room, on the right.
No, this is their bedroom.
Did Dad paint this himself?
Yes.
He had to take you driving
today of all days?
Jalila, where are you?
-They're coming, Jalila!
-Shit...
It's nothing.
You call this nothing?
I can't go out like this!
So go change your dress.
Go get me one.
What? A dress?
Yes. I'll wait here.
-They'll be here any second.
-What do you want me to do?
What are you doing?
Getting you a dress.
Getting you a dress.
Get undressed. There's no time.
Move out of the way.
Move.
Welcome.
I'm Jalila, Suliman's first wife.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Go on in.
Go on in.
Tasnim!
-Tasnim, why aren't you wearing a dress?
-Because!
-You're not going over there!
-Dad says I can.
What are you wearing?
Drop it.
Here, get it over with.
You wouldn't believe
the house he built her.
Don't worry about it now.
Come on.
Let's talk about it some other time.
God will take care of it.
Please think about it, Suliman.
The boy is driving me crazy.
It'll be all right.
When?
-Let her graduate first.
-What does she need college for?
Munir makes good money.
He'll give her a nice home.
-Hello.
-Greetings.
Congratulations.
Hello.
-A thousand congratulations.
-Thank you so much.
With God's help, you'll be more generous
at my second wedding.
Hello! How are you?
-Is Munir Jamil's brother?
-Yes.
Yuck, he's so fat.
Sanumi, that's not nice.
Write down $200.
Welcome, please have a seat.
Hello?
Hello?
Who is this?
No, this is definitely not Layla.
Tell me it's not what I think.
It's not, he's just a guy from school.
Tell him to never talk to you again.
Lulu...
Hello?
Lulu? Can you hear me?
Don't you dare call her again. Understood?
Hello.
Greetings.
Congratulations.
Same to you.
How was the wedding?
All right?
Good morning.
Good morning.
Did you manage to remove all the hairpins?
Sort of. Suliman helped me.
Great.
What a mess, huh?
As long as you enjoyed it.
Thank God.
Except for the mixtape.
I was hoping we'd have a DJ.
Jalila, what are you doing?
I'm almost done.
-Samir and Jamil said they'd clean up.
-It's all right.
-But why?
-I can do it myself.
What's with the boxes?
I thought...
Thought what?
I need clothes for the new house.
Please.
No problem.
-We're leaving.
-Have fun.
-Do you need anything...?
-I don't need anything.
Hurry up.
One second.
What's the hurry?
Next time wake up when you're told.
Stop! It's wet.
Mom.
-Wash it again.
-I'm not doing it again.
Why not?
Because I'm late.
Late for what, exactly?
What do you mean?
-I can't miss classes right now...
-You should've thought of it before.
Alright, go.
Bye.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What?
You can't keep me locked
in the house.
Mom!
I won't talk to him, I promise.
Dad would never allow this.
Too bad for you he isn't here.
Turn on the light.
-What?
-Turn it on.
Son of a bitch.
To the right!
Now the left.
Hold it for a second.
Stop, stop! Enough.
Now what?
Turn it harder.
I am.
-Turn it as hard as you can.
-I'm turning it as hard as I can!
-Let me.
-Wait.
Great.
Great job.
Really, great job.
What are you doing?
We'll wash the laundry by hand.
No way! You lost it!
I lost it? Me?
Tell me, how long has this been going on?
A week? Two? A month? More?
How long have you been lying?
And what for?
Some boy from another tribe?
I don't understand you.
I really don't.
Do you want to leave?
No.
Then what do you want?
I love him.
You're never going to see him again.
You hear me? Forget about him.
Get to work.
Layla.
Layla!
What are you listening to?
Check it out.
Again?
-What?
-Don't you get tired of this song?
You don't understand anything.
I was just listening to Ahlam's new song.
-She's got a new song?
-Yes.
-I'll send it to you?
-Mmm.
Ah, no.
Why?
I don't think my mom will like her.
Oh, right.
Trouble?
Sort of.
I was worried about you.
Yeah?
I thought a lot.
-What about?
-About what we are going to do.
What do you mean?
I think we should go to my uncle.
You can't be serious.
He will help us, for sure.
At least until we work something out.
What do you think?
Lulu?
I can't believe
we are discussing this again.
-I'm not running away with you!
-But...
I can't put my dad through that.
-Don't give me that look.
-But there's no other way.
You're such a coward!
-He'll cut my head off!
-No, he won't.
-I would cut my head off if I were him!
-You don't know him!
You'll marry me
even if I don't have a head.
Yeah.
I can manage.
Fine.
Really, I can manage. Get up.
You don't have to worry.
It'll all work out. I promise.
As long as you promise.
You'll see.
Dad will help me.
Dad will help you?
What's going on in that head of yours?
What do you think
is going to happen?
-Dad will see that...
-See what?
That because he lets you study,
you hang out with boys?
-I'll explain to him that...
-Explain what, exactly?
I'll explain it to him.
No problem.
I changed my mind.
The laundry's all yours.
-Pass it over.
-Now?
Yes, now.
Let me.
-You want to?
-Yes.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Anwar?
Lulu?
-Where are you?
-Here.
Where?
There's a dress to my right.
Does that help?
I don't know. Is it pretty?
Who's there?
Why are we being quiet?
-So she won't hear us.
-Why?
My dad isn't back yet.
You said he'd be home by noon.
-Go before she sees you.
-And what?
Who's he?
Nobody.
Go.
Layla, I'm not leaving.
-She'll be here any second.
-Ahem!
Hello.
Greetings.
What's going on here?
I'm here to see Suliman.
He isn't home.
I told him. He was just leaving.
You, go inside.
Now!
Layla, leave me with your mother.
Just for a moment.
Don't worry. Really.
-I want you to go.
-Let me wait for your husband.
He isn't coming back soon.
There's no point waiting.
I apologize for coming here like this.
-I know it isn't proper behavior.
-Nothing about this is proper.
I know. I'm very sorry.
But I won't go until I speak to your
husband.
Now you listen to me,
I don't know what Layla told you,
but believe me,
you don't want to speak to Suliman.
It won't end well, not for you,
not for Layla, not for anyone.
You understand me?
Don't move until you hear from me.
Hello.
Greetings.
-How are you?
-Thank God.
-And the girls?
-Great.
Thank God.
I see you went shopping.
Yeah, we shopped in Amman,
mainly in the big market
where we bought the tiger blanket.
But you can't bring all that inside now.
What do you mean?
See for yourself.
The clothes are all wet.
Jalila, I have a lot to unload.
Fine, I just finished all the laundry.
I can't take it down now.
What, you want me to do it?
Is everything okay, Suliman?
We'll go in in a minute.
Should I take down the laundry?
Give me a second, please.
Jalila, come on.
I don't have time for your crap.
I don't have time for your crap either.
Come back later.
Jalila.
Wait a minute, Jalila!
Layla.
Layla!
-Ibrahim is your uncle?
-My mother's uncle.
They demolished houses
at your village yesterday?
-But not yours.
-No. My uncle's and his son's.
Bastards.
Another cousin got a choice,
demolish his house himself or pay a fine.
How much is the fine?
70,000.
-Where'll he get 70,000?
-He won't.
He'll bulldoze it himself.
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
Congratulations on your wedding.
Thank you.
Dad!
Dad!
Tell me, didn't you embarrass me
enough for one day?
You're screaming
in the middle of the village.
Go home.
What did he say?
Layla.
What are you doing?
Layla, stop it.
Layla.
Layla, enough.
Yuck, Mom.
Ruined, it's all ruined.
And sour.
Can't even make a decent meal here.
I don't want you going there.
Dad says I can.
Enough already with that!
I'm sorry.
Come here.
Why?
Come here.
What are you doing?
-You want to go?
-Yes.
Then be quiet.
Stop it, Mom!
Go.
You've gone completely crazy.
To the left, to the left.
No, no!
To the left.
-What?
-To the left!
-Everything under control?
-Yes.
-What happened there?
-Nothing.
What do you mean nothing?
Who was Dad talking to?
Tell me.
Uncle Mustapha.
Who else?
Ahmad.
-What did they say?
-Mommy, I'm hungry.
In a minute.
-What did they say?
-Don't ask me, ask Dad!
Layla's getting married.
To who?
Munir.
-Where's your father now?
-He went to Affaf.
Started smoking again?
Are you crazy?
It isn't respectable.
Why didn't you tell me
about the generator?
Since when do I have to tell you?
I couldn't fix it.
What did you do, Suliman?
What I had to do.
You had to, again?
Do you ever do anything
because you want to?
I don't feel like going into this again.
Not now.
Are you going to tell her?
Later.
Why later?
Affaf made dinner.
You ate with her the whole honeymoon.
I thought...
I didn't know if you wanted me to come.
Who's Munir?
He's a good man.
He'll be a good husband.
I promise you.
It'll be all right.
I'm going to make some tea.
-Layla.
-I want some tea.
Layla.
-Layla.
-What?
What's going on there?
Nothing.
-Dad?
-Don't move.
-Where are you?
-Here.
Show me.
Wait.
Hold it up.
-What's going on here?
-What happened?
Don't walk around here now.
-It's nothing.
-What's nothing?
It's just a scratch.
Just a scratch? Just a scratch?
You're home for a minute
and this happens.
-Jalila...
-Don't "Jalila" me.
Get away from the glass.
Where did that Munir boy come from?
Tell me, who put that idea
in your head, huh?
Of all the boys in the village,
you chose Munir?
Did you ever look at your daughter?
She's pretty, and smart.
And she'll make a good wife.
She deserves the best husband she can get.
Why Munir?
-Jalila, I...
-Don't "Jalila" me!
She won't see that boy anymore, I promise.
But find her a decent husband.
I'm sorry, but...
That wasn't a request!
You won't marry her to someone
not worthy! You hear me?
Now go find her someone decent.
Be a man for a change!
I'm not a man?
Jalila, wait a minute.
-Think about what you're doing.
-I've thought plenty.
This can't be overlooked.
I'll have to respond tomorrow.
You'll "have to" again. What a surprise.
You have until three! One. Two.
-Come on, let's go.
-Thank God.
-Put this on.
-No.
-Take it!
-No.
Hi, Grandpa.
-No school today?
-No.
Where's your mother?
At home.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
I'm going.
Layla, I need you here.
For what? I'll wash the floor later.
Do you ever open your eyes
to what's around you?
My eyes are open.
Believe me, they are open.
He is banishing you!
Don't worry about the girls.
They stay here.
I'm waiting.
Speak.
You have to speak.
Your father has a hearing
with Suliman tonight.
It's between me and Suliman.
How did you manage to get banished?
-What happened?
-How did I manage?
You decided it's my fault?
-How can I know...
-You can be on my side!
I am on your side!
You are never on my side.
I am on your side.
Speak.
What do you want?
I don't want to lose my girls.
Then you wish to go back to Suliman.
Go to school already.
Don't want to.
-Don't want to.
-Don't want to!
Then do something with yourselves.
What?
I don't know.
Wash the floor.
It gets dirty again in ten minutes.
I can't argue with that logic.
I'm hungry.
Soon.
-Come over here.
-Why?
Because I asked.
Layla!
Okay, alright.
Put this in the bowl.
No.
-Then what do you want?
-Tea with milk.
And an egg.
Wait here.
Hello.
Greetings.
Is my dad home?
He is in the shower.
Cheese?
Hey.
Yes.
-Eggs?
-Yes.
How many?
I don't know. Four, five.
Anything else?
You've got milk?
I heard you are getting married.
Congratulations.
You don't have the regular kind?
You'll have fun.
-At the wedding, you'll see.
-Alright.
And it's better this way.
What's better?
Less problems.
So you won't end up like me.
What do you mean, like you?
You know.
Like me.
What exactly are you complaining about?
Nothing, I'm just saying.
I need vegetables too.
Fine.
Give her everything she needs.
Wait!
Talk to me.
I have nothing to say.
Tell me what you thought of him.
If you cared about what I think,
we wouldn't be in this situation.
-I'm sorry if I hurt you.
-You didn't.
If you only spoke with him, I'm sure...
Layla, go back home!
Wait, Dad!
Are you going to the hearing?
What is going to happen?
Do I look like a prophet to you?
-You're shouting!
-Of course I'm shouting!
Do you think I know
what your mom is thinking?
If she wants to come back?
If she even wants to hear my name again?
Then why did you banish her?
I didn't have a choice.
There is always a choice.
Grow up already.
Tell them I'm not going to marry Munir!
You will do as you are told. Understand?
Now go take care of your sisters!
Get ready.
For what?
Get ready and put on your shoes.
Put the seat belt on.
Alright.
Go to Mom.
Hello.
What brings you here?
Tasnim, come on.
Layla.
Alright, enough.
No. No, no. No way.
What is this?
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
-What are you doing?
-That's it.
Grandma!
-I said that's it.
-Give it back!
-Forget about the car.
-Give it to me.
Don't you have any shame?
This is outrageous!
Jalila. Jalila!
-Jalila, don't get involved.
-Let her leave.
Leave?
What are you talking about? Huh?
Your family didn't go through enough?
Jalila, they're not staying here.
Jalila!
Get inside.
Mom!
Go.
There's nothing for you here.
Take care of yourself.
Mom!
Lulu? Did you take the exit?
Yeah, sorry.
Listening?
Yes. What now?
I'm waiting after the tunnel.
What tunnel?
Oh.
Should I go through it?
Yeah, go through the middle.
Okay, just a minute.
Are you nuts? What are you doing here?
I need to talk to you.
What the hell, Layla?
Get in the car.
Get in!
Is he here?
Layla!
Which one is he?
The second from the left.
He is very respected. A good man. Really,
he is good. You'll find peace with him.
Alright.
Don't you want peace, after all this?
I said alright.
Don't you trust me?
No.
Drive to Mom.
What?
You want me to marry Munir? Start the car.
I can't just come over there.
-I have to let Ibrahim...
-You don't "have to" do anything.
Hello.
The purple wall is just awful.
Alright, I'll repaint. With what?
Blue? Blue is nice.
No.
Red? Pink?
No!
Tasnim!
