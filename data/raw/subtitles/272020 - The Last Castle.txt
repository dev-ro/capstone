Okay. Thankyou.
Sir?
Sir?
[ Exhales ]
It's the real deal.
He is coming in
at 1 700 hours.
Seventeen hundred hours today?
That's what they said, sir.
I don't understand.
The trial began today.
Apparently, he pled guilty
and got ten years.
They're expediting
his transfer as a courtesy.
Oh, as a courtesy?
They should be naming a base
after the man. Not sending him here.
My God, Eugene Irwin.
Well, we have verdict.
We have a sentence.
We have a prisoner.
We do ourjob...
whetherwe like it or not.
Puts us on our toes,
though, doesn't it?

Um, that's an authorized item.
I'd appreciate that.
Onesetofkeys. Glasses.
I'm going to need your ring.
Thankyou.
Oh. Actually, you can keep that.
Academy rings are authorized.
Three stars, two sets.
Looks like that's everything.
- So, uh--
- [ Knocking On Door]
- Sir? Prisoner Irwin is outside.
- Fiveminutes.
Five minutes.
You can put that down ifyou want.
- You talking to me?
- Yes.
I know whatyou're thinking.
Do I saluteyou, or doyou salute me?
Well, the answer is neither.
My men salute me, ofcourse,
and each other according to rank.
But there isnosaluting
by thegeneralprisonpopulation.
Well, first things first.
Areyou hungry?
- No.
- Areyousure?Mondaysare

Indeed. May I
offeryou some lemonade?
- Thankyou.
-Just be a minute, sir.
- PrisonerAguilar--
- Ifyou'll step over here, I'll giveyou...
abasic layout
ofthe facility.
The building we're in now
is the administration building.
That building there
houses the tiers.
That's whereyou
and the other inmates will live.
The building next to it is the laundry,
where I've had you assigned.
Oh, that is
the old blockhouse wall.
It'sall that's leftof
the originalprison from the 1870s.
Icould've removedit, butI thought
it was important tokeepasense ofhistory,
so Iaskedthemen

Please.
[Peretz]
Come on. Let'sgo.
Ipersonallymeet with
everynewinmatehereat theprison.
Usually downstairs.
AndIask them a question.
What doyou expect from
your time here at the castle?
Nothing.
Just to do my time and go home.
Perfect.
That is the perfect answer.
And now I have what may seem
under the circumstances,
a bizarre request.
I have a collection ofmost
ofthe seminal books on warfare,
including The Burden ofCommand.
AndI was wondering ifyou would
dome thehonorofsigningit?
- Certainly.
- Thankyou.
- Captain Peretz.
- Yes, sir?
Two minutes.
- That's impressive.
- Yeah. It's a great collection, isn't it?
Yeah, sure.
That'saminieball
from Shiloh, usedinbattle.
Grant lost 1 3,000 men
at Shiloh.
Suppose this got one of'em?
Never know. Doyou?
I mean, doyou
collect anything?
[Irwin]
No.
Justa fewcoins fromsome of
the countries I've traveledto.
My father didn't care
for military collections.
I guess it stuckwith me.
Any man with a collection like this
is a man who's never set foot
on a battlefield.

No. No. We are--
We're through here.
PrisonerAguilar, what areyou doing?
You do not salute this man.
This man has no rank.
Saluting amongst prisoners is prohibited.
Y-Yes, sir.
Bu-But I was saluting you.
- Take the prisoners
to their cells, Captain.
- Yes, sir.
Thankyou for
your hospitality, Colonel.
You're welcome.

[ Chattering ]
Howyou doing?
You probably don't remember me,
but I served underyou in the Gulf.
Dr. Thomas Bernard,
33rd Medical Unit.
That's right. Actually, it's
Lee Bernard, but close enough.
You were arrested for hashish--
possession ofhashish-- as I remember.
- That's right.
- It was a small amount, as I recall.
- You don't get sent here for that.
- No, no. You don't.
There's more to it than that.
Hey, Thumper!
- I was able to getyou an aspirin.
- Thanks.
[ Exhales ] I got shot
with a real bullet once, Doc.
Didn't hurt this much.
That's the upside ofreal bullets,
they cut through the flesh,
hit fewer nerve endings.
Downside is they kill you.
Ofcourse, so do
the rubber ones sometimes.
[Thumper]
Hellofa downside.
Hey, Doc, you think Imight
getone ofthem Purple Hearts?
Absolutely, Thumper. You take it easy.
I'll try to getyou some more.
You know Winter played us
with that one basketball shit?
Come on, man.
- General, sir.
- Don'tcallmesir.
I'm notageneralanymore.
- Can we at least talk toyou?
- About what?
You still got friends in the Pentagon,
right? You could talk to them.
I'm a little hazy
on the subject matter.
Look, what happened here today
happens all the time, sir.
- Let me get this straight.
You mean there's violence?
- Yeah.
- In a prison packed with violent criminals.
- That's not what we're saying.
No. There'sbeen--
Howmany thisyear, Doc?
Um, 1 3 men down, 1 1 ofthem
were critical injuries--
Stopyour fucking whining.
Listen toyourselves.
Then he only gives us the most
basic medical treatment.
Completelysubstandard services.
- Substandard services?
- Yes. Substandard services.
It's fucked-up shit, man.
I had a friend in Hanoi who had
to repair his own fractured tibia.
You cannot begin to compare what went on
in a foreign POW camp 30 years ago--
No, you can't compare.
I've led real soldiers in more
difficult situations than this.
Butyou're not real soldiers
anymore, and neither am I.
There've been murders.
Doyou know what happens when
you take a rubber bullet to the head?
Thelightsgo out.
Twice in the lastyear
there've been accidents...
- where men have been
hit in the head and killed.
- Nothing can be proven.
We're talking about expert marksmen
shooting from minimal distances.
The guardsjust say the guy
turned his head and boom.
It's not a random thing. You get on
Winter's bad side, you're done.
When you're doing
combat duty, after awhile,
lifejust becomes snapshots.
Most ofthem horrible.
But not all ofthem.
Threeyears ago in Bosnia,
I was driving a small unit
through an I FOR town.
And I saw something
pretty interesting.
I saw an old man
sitting on a bombed-out porch,
playingagame ofDominos with
whatIpresumeishis grandson.
When IsawthatI thought,
youknow, it's myturn.
I didn't retire after that, as I should have.
I took one last assignment.
It was a mistake.
So, gentlemen, I'm done.
I'm not fighting anyone
or anything anymore.
I'm doing my time here,
I'm going home, and God willing,
I'm going to sit on the porch
and play a game of Dominos...
with my grandson,
who I've never met.
What'd I fucking tell you, Doc?
You call a three-star General ''man''?
Why don'tyou call him ''dude''?
[Man On P.A.]Attention, inmates,

- Watch yourself, snitch.
- Hey, Yates, everything all right?
- Okay.
- [Inmate]Myboysayyougotaniceass.
I got a guy in 1 29 who's
way behind, telling me stories.
- How late is he?
- Three weeks.
- Why didn'tyou tell me?
- I'm telling you now.
Yates, no way that was a touchdown,
baby. That was a fucked-up call.
Keep that shit on the down-low.
They're all fucked-up calls.
Howyou doing?
So we lost: 22 to 20.
Army-Navygame.
Class of'92.
I metyou once
when I was a kid.
1981. It wasa welcome-back celebration
at the White House forthe POWs.
- My fatherwas with you in Hanoi.
- What's your name?
- Yates.
- Yates? Sam Yates?
That's right.
- Good man.
- Nah, he wasn't.
After 30 years, everyone's
a good man. It's the law.
- Mmm.
- How is he? How's your dad?
He's not too good. He's dead.
- [Man On P.A., Indistinct]
- I'm sorry. What happened?
Came home.
Billingworth, Irwin,Jacobson--
You're late. You have five minutes
left on yourvisitor.
- Fiveminutes left.
- [ Chattering ]
Rosalie?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- It's good ofyou to come.
- Thankyou.
Was it hard getting here?
Um, I missed a turn.
It'sjust good to seeyou.
- How's Ben? Good?
- Fine. Uh-huh.
- School okay? Grades?
- Um, well he's in first grade.
- Well, doyou have a picture ofhim?
- No.
The one I have is twoyears old.
He must have changed a lot
since-- since then.
And how areyou, Rosalie?
Um--
- Look, Dad--
- Uh-oh. ''Look, Dad.''
I just-- I can't do this.
I can't do this small-talk thing
with you.
The whole drive over here,
I was trying to thinkwhat--
What am I going to say?
What can we talk about
beyond the weather...
and how's Ben,
and I just went blank.
Do I-- Do I intimidateyou?
- Intimidate me?
- I guess that's the downside...
ofhaving a ''Yes, sir'' ''No, sir''
military father, but I tried not to--
You weren't a father at all.
God, I'm sorry. I don't want to whine.
I'm not here to be cruel.
You're a great man.
And you've done so much
for this country.
- But?
- No. No but. No but.
Just this isn't the place.
Well, it's the only place
I've got right now, Rose.
Why did you call me, Dad?
Why? I don't knowyou.
You don't know me.
I mean, what did you think
asking me here?
That I'd come every Sunday
and maybe I'd bring Ben...
and he would sit
and colorwhile we talked?
There was a time.
When I was about 20,
I had a whole list ofthings
I was going to say toyou.
- [BellRings]
- Those days are gone.
[Guard] The visitationsessionis over.
Please concludeyour visits.
- [Inmate]
This isn'tenough time, man.
- Let'sgo, folks. Let'sgo.
I'm sorryyou're in this place.
And I wish you the best.
[ScatteredGood-byes]
I wish you the best.
I guess you figured out
what to say after all.
- I guess I did.
- Be all right ifI wrote? Is that okay?
There's some things
I'd like to tell you.
When I was in first grade,
I got straight ''As.''
[Inmate]
Come on. Let'sgo.
- Afternoon, sir.
- Don't call me that. I'm not--
Putyour hand down.
- Permission to speak, sir.
- What?
I just wanted to say
welcome to the castle, sir.
- It's good to haveyou aboard, sir.
- Aboard?
- You Navy puke, son?
- No, no, sir. I was in the Corps.
What rankwereyou
when you were arrested?
- I was a C-C-C--
- It was either Colonel or Corporal.
- I'm guessing Corporal.
- Yes, sir.
Why areyou here?
What did you do?
Well, that'sjust it.
I di-didn't do nothing.
It was a mistake.
Oh. Okay.
[Man On P.A.]
Medication callis in fiveminutes.
I h-hurt someone real bad.
How long you been here?
- Twoyears.
- And how long doyou have?
How much longer?
Fouryears, eight months,
eleven days.
And this mistake,
you'vejust the one?
Just-Just one.
-Just one day in your life?
-Ju-Ju-Ju--
No. Takeyour time.
Got plenty ofthat.
Just five seconds, sir.
And you're a marine forwhat,
one or twoyears?
And you're a violent criminal
for five seconds?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, according to my calculations,
that makes you mostly Marine.
About 98 percent, I'd say.
- Yes, sir.
- Then why not act like one?
Stand tall.
This thing thatyou're doing with your
hand, grabbing your hair, what's that?
- That was a salute.
- A sa-- Oh, no. [ Laughs ]
- I don't think so.
You know where saluting comes from?
- No, sir.
It comes from medieval times.
Two knights would approach
each other on horseback.
Theywould raise theirvisors
and show their faces.
It's like they're saying,
''This is who I am.
I'm not the enemy
and I'm not afraid.''
A salute's about respect, son.
Respect foryourself,
the service and the flag.
- [Knocking On Door]
- Ifyou'regoing to do this--
Sir, you wantedtoseeme? Sir?
Come.
Look at that.
- Oh, man.
- No, no, no.
At the War College,
his very name was spoken...
with a reverence.
As ifthe syllables themselves conveyed
what it meant to be a soldier.
Now here he is commanding
an army ofone--
the stuttering monkey.
Can't even watch.
I discussed the regulations
on saluting with Aguilar, did I not?
- Yes, sir.
- Remind him again-- effectively.
[Horn Blaring]
Putyour hand down.
Put it down.
- You don't have to do this.
- Prisoner Irwin, what areyou doing?
- He doesn't have to do this.
- Look,just step back in the prison--
Son, I know a thing or two
about the disciplining ofsoldiers.
- PrisonerAguilar,
resumeyour punishment.
- Punishment is over.
Aguilar, I'm warning you--
- [Whistle]
- Men down!Men down!
You're better than this.
- Okay, okay. That's enough.

Stay down!Everybodystay down!
What is happening here?
This prisonerwas interfering
with the corporal punishment
ofprisonerAguilar.
Prisoner Irwin, I understand
your coming here must be
a big adjustment foryou.
To go from commanding
thousands oftroops in battle,
having no war to fight and no one
to followyou must not be easy.
However, I do ask thatyou learn
how things are done around here...
and try to set an example
for the other men.
Saluting is prohibited.
Aguilarwas saluting.
He is being disciplined.
Surelyyou understand that.
- Captain, take the prisoner
back to his cell.
- Yes, sir.
Sir? May the prisoner speak, sir?
- Yes.
- According to the ManualofConduct,
the corporal punishment for
a prisoner begun on the day shift...
cannotexceed
the followingmorning'shorn.
Prisoner Irwin,
you are absolutely right.
Thankyou for bringing that
to my attention.
- Captain. Captain.
- Yes, sir.
Prisoner Irwin,
under no circumstances...
is an inmate allowed to make
physical contact with an officer.
Youhave violatedthe
U.S.M.C.F. Manual ofConduct.
And this violation
requires discipline.
What's going on?
- Winter'sgothim

No way. Three-two against.
Come on, youguys.
Thosestones weigh25pounds apiece.
It'sgonnabe 85 degrees bynoon.
We have 2,000 percent humidity.
The guy's not going to make the day.
- Everyone paid up this week?
- Yeah, we're good.
Put mine in,
double or nothing against.
No way he's gonna make it.
- Beaupre, 12.

Hey, hey, hey.

You can take off

- [Inmate #1] Hey!
- [Inmate #2] What the fuck is that?
- Electrical burn scars.

How long was he in there?
Sixyears.

It's all over. Stay down.
- Look at me.
- Follow it.
- It'sall done. Allover.
It's all over.
Yates, 36 packs you owe me.
- How many?

- Yeah!
- [ Inmates Chanting ] Go! Go! Go!
[ Cheering ]
[ Cheering Continues ]
Yes, sir.
[ Blows Whistle ]
The discipline order
was horn-to-horn labor.
Doesn't matterwhere the stones are.
You have to continue.
What's he supposed to do, Captain?
Hejust moved the whole goddamn pile.
Well, he can move 'em back.
- [ Exhales ]
- Betsarestillon.
- Seven-two, against.
- You're a fuckin' snake, man.
- Don't bet ifyou don't want to.

Whywould you kill yourself
to help him with his wall?
It's not his wall.
It's yourwall.
Prisoner Irwin, let's go.
The commandant
would like to seeyou.
- They clean you up okay?
- Yes.
The cut aboveyour eye,
it's not too serious I hope.
I'm okay.
[ Sighs ]
Well, I am sorry about this.
It's the standard cooling-offperiod
after a punishment detail.
I hopeyou understand...
I did this for the men.
- The men?
- Yes, toshowthem--
Toshowthem thatyouare
no different than theyare.
Your new friend, Aguilar, he took
a claw hammer to his platoon leader.
He maimed him in a quote,
unquote fit ofrage.
[ Sighs ] Whenever I am...
filled with doubt--
whenever sentiment creeps in--
Ijusthave to openaninmate's file
andsee whathe's done.
Isee whathe's capable of.
Isee the worstinhim.
And that makes myjob easier.
It crystallizes my mission.
- Take him back to the tiers.
- Yes, sir.
Hold on.
- Sergeant, takinghim back to cell345.
- Verywell, Private.

Goodnight, guys.

Aguilar placed a bet foryou.

That's36bundles.
You could getyourself
thrown out ofthe Hall of Fame
for betting on yourself.
Corporal Aguilar.
Would you pass these out
to the men? I don't smoke.
Thankyou, sir.
- Soyou're the gambler.
- Nah, I don't gamble.
I'm just the bookkeeper.
- Yeah?Ihearyou're running
asuicidepoolonme.
- That's right.
- Any squares left?
- [ Chuckles ] Yeah, there's one.
Nine weeks.
- How much to enter?
- No way, man.
Knowing you, you'd offyourself
just to win the bet.
Oh-ho, not me.
I bet on myself, it's to win.
Yeah, you don't always win.
No. [ Chuckles ]
Clearly not.
You know, my father said
you kept him alive in Hanoi.
- Hesaidyoukeptall thoseguysalive.
- Nah.
When you're tortured,
the first thing they do is try
to break down your sense ofself.
And I broke in Hanoi.
Forweeks, the last thing in
my mind was self-preservation.
In fact, I prayed
for death every night.
And the only thing that kept me
from answering those prayers,
were the voices ofthe men
in the other rooms--
your father among them.
I don't care whatyou've heard, Yates.
They kept me alive.
Not the otherway around.
Hey!Sir?
Youcostmemy wholestash
ofsmokes.
Oh. Well, I'm sorry about that.
Well, you win some,
you lose some.
So what did you mean earlier
about it being ourwall?
I mean, it's Winter's wall.
That fuckjust makes us work it
to keep us occupied.
It's like we're a bunch
oflittle kids or something.
In 1 870, there was nothing here.
The original prison was built
by prisoners. I want to show--
I want to showyou something
I found the other day.
Where?
Oh, here it is.
You see this?
''Private A.J. Beck, 1 91 2-1 923.''
Now why doyou suppose
Private Beck--
What doyou think he was doing,
building his own prison?
- How the fuck do I know?
- Well, I don't know either,
but I can make a guess.
My guess is he wasn't
building a prison.
My guess is he was
building something else.
They may have told him to build
a prison, but, in his own mind,
he was raising walls
to protect himself.
My guess is he was
building a castle.
That's a castle?
Yeah, it could be. Could be.
- Ifsomebodyrebuiltit.
- How we supposed to do that, sir?
Howareyousupposedto do that?
Idon'tknowanythingabout walls.

[ Hysterical Laughter]

Good morning, sir.
- What happened here?
- The prisoners,
they knocked it down, sir.
- Why?
- Irwin, he told them to.
Thankyou.
Beau-Beaupre?
What's up, Aguilar?
Th-That's not the right rock.
Cutbush, you believe this kid?
Yeah, he seems
to know his shit, you know?
All right, Aguilar. I'll bite.
- Bring me the right rock.
- O-Okay.
You need a rock
with a flat edge,
because-because
that one'sjagged.
- Th-Thejagged ones go in the middle.
- The middle? All right.
Bring me another one.
IfI keep getting you the flat rocks,
you'll never learn--
I'll getyou one more,
okay, Beaupre?
Mr. Aguilar?Itlooksgood.

- They did.
Now, listen. Be sure to leave a window,

Hey, hold up on the work.
Come on.
Putyour name right in here.
Spell it out.
A-- [ Stutters ] G-G-G.
- Scumbagsarehaving
atit, sir. Yes, sir.
- [Winter]Really?
They're calling Irwin ''Chief.''
That's the word they got for General.
They got substitute names
for the other ranks, too, sir.
Anybodywho was a captain is ''Boss.''
Sergeants are ''Sport,'' Privates are ''Pal.''
Playing soldier, sir.
- Hearts and minds.
- Sir?
He's building a structure ofloyalty.
He's offering them self-respect,
in exchange for obedience.
The general is building
himselfan army.
He can have their hearts and minds, sir.
As long as we got 'em by the balls.
- Well put, Corporal.
- Thankyou, sir.
- Captain.
- [ Cocks Gun ]
- Bring him to my office.
- Who, sir?
- The prince ofVenezuela.
Who doyou think?
- General Irwin?
Mr. Irwin.
[Winter] Whenyoufirstarrived,
Iaskedyoua question.
Ineedtoaskagain.
Whatdoyou wantfromyour time
hereat the castle, Mr. Irwin?
And my answer is the same
as it was then.
Do my time. Go home.
Soyou say, but everything
you have done has contradicted that.
[ Sighs ] These men are not here
for unpaid parking fines and traffic--
I'm under no illusion why
the men are here, Colonel.
I just think they might
be reminded...
about some ofthe good things they've
done, rather than only the worst.
Yes, that is-- that is something
my predecessor used to say.
In his last twoyears here there
were seven escape attempts,
twelve injury assaults on officers
and N.C.O.s, including one killed.
Since I've assumed command,
there have been zero escape attempts,
zero injury assaults,
zero fatalities.
Somemayquestion
mymethods, but they do work.
No soldier has ever died needlessly
under my command, Mr. Irwin.
See, I, too, share
theburden ofcommand.
Youmaynot think that
I've eversetfootonabattlefield,
but that'sbecauseyou'venever
satbehindthis desk-- this desk.
My men and I are
vastly outnumbered.
We spend every day
behind enemy lines.
Because, makenomistakeaboutit,
Mr. Irwin, they are the enemy.
But I don't need tojustify
myselftoyou, do I?
I don't know.
Doyou?
This wall...
that has become the focus
ofso much... tension...
andturmoil--
Well... inabout twominutes,

But this is not a disgrace.

It was unfortunate about...
Aguilar.
But tough decisions
dogo with thejob.
Burden ofcommand, correct?
[ Exhales ]
Look.
These salutes, I've given
them some thought.
Technically, theyarenot
a violation ofregulations.
So, ifthe inmates can
confine themselves to a simple...

Iseenoproblem withit.
And ifthe men want to call
you chief, well, that's fine.
Free speech and all that.
- Okay, then.
- No, not okay.
It's too late, Colonel.
- It's too late forwhat?
- Foryour offer.
The men don't want to salute.
They don't want to use rank.
They don't want better food.
They don't want more TV.
Theyjust wantyour resignation.
So do I.
- My resignation?
- You're a disgrace, Colonel.
A disgrace to the uniform.
You should not be allowed
to retain your command.
Well, then I'd better go pack.
[ Chuckles ]
- I thinkyou should.
- Oh?
Tell me, Mr. Irwin,
what's to stop me from just...
placing you in the hole...
for, say, six months?
Nothing.
Ifthat's the way
you want to win.
[ Peretz ]
Sir, ifI can make a suggestion,
- maybe we should
isolate prisoner Irwin--
- Get me General Wheeler.
[Inmates Shouting]
Yes, sir.
[Winter] Two weeks ago,
I watchedashemarched
aman upanddown theyard.
A minoreccentricity. Fine.
Since then,
he'sbeenacting as though...
hestillhasa command
insome fantasyarmy.
- Andyesterday--
- I don't thinkyou'd
want to make general.
Now, you wouldn't want to give up
all these perks, would you?
[ Laughs ]
Sorry. Go on.
Yesterday, Mr. Irwin...
told me he required
my resignation.
Frankly, I think he's
started to lose the plot.
You saying he's delusional?
I'm saying he needs
professional psychiatric help.
He's sick and becoming pathetic.
Uh, you might want to be a little
more careful in yourword choice.
That sick, pathetic man
put this star on my shoulder.
Yes, sir. I know.
And I also know that
you sat in on his court-martial.
And don't talk about things
that are aboveyour pay grade.
- Hmm?
- Yes, sir.
General Wheeler, I admire
the man as much as you do.
So I want tosee that
hegets thebestcarepossible.
And I'm not sure that
this is the right place for that.
All right.
Well, let me see him.
[BuzzerBuzzes, DoorOpens]
Do we read the rules, sir?
Read 'em.
Well, sir, normally
for a contact visit,
folks are limited to one embrace
in the beginning and one at the end.
And, uh, hands must be
visible at all times, also.
I guess that rules out the hand-job.
[ Laughs ]
Thankyou, gentlemen.
- Permission to be seated, sir.
- Permission granted.
- What areyou doing here,Jim?
- I'm here to see ifyou've lostyour mind.
- [ Chuckles ]
- [Sheila]Uh, heshouldbe
available later.
- I can take a mes--Just a second.
- Goodmorning, Miss Kelly.
-Jim--Jim, yeah-- Hold on--
- Miss Kelly?
Miss Kelly,

- I found that--
I found that top one laying on

- Hold on one second. What, Danny?
- Ifoundthat top one...
- layingon the floorin thehallway.
- Fine. Thanks, Danny.
Uh, yeah. Wejust needed you to send
him up here as soon as possible.
[Phone Ringing]
He'ssayingyou're delusional,
thatyou're acting as ifyou're
still in command ofan army.
He's saying I'm delusional
because he wants me gone.
[ Sighs ]
[Wheeler]
Now, ifyouhadironcladevidence...
ofWinter killing a man in cold blood
for no good reason,
then I could do something, maybe.
Outside ofthat, the man's been
investigated three times.
He's been
exonerated three times.
And as far as Washington
is concerned,
- he's doin'asuperbjob.
- [ Chuckles ]
Yeah, andyou're
a convictedcriminal.
- You could get another investigation.
- Yes, Icould.
But withoutanynewevidence,
what wouldbe thepoint?
And besides that,

I don't give a rat's ass.

Ofcourse not.
He'll keep it hidden until
the last possible second.

Go, go, go!
Gene, what the hell is this about?
Is this about control?
- Because, you know,

- Go, go, go, go, go!

You thought he was gonna try
to take me hostage?
- Yes, it was a precautionary move.
- What the hell kind of...
grab-ass unit areyou
running here, Colonel?
Sir, at 1 1 :58 this morning,
I received a letter...
stating a group ofinmates were
planning on taking you hostage at 1 2:1 0.
I thought it prudent to act immediately
to ensureyour safety.
I've been hearing some disturbing
things about what goes on in here.
And now I'm hearing it from a man
I trust and whose opinion I respect.
- May I speak freely, sir?
- Yes, you may.
With all due respect, General,
I don't know what
you may have been hearing.
But until you've spent some time
in theyard with those animals,
you have no idea
what happens in there.
Point taken, Colonel.
Nevertheless, ifI hear...
one more story about a man dying
underyour command,
you are through here.
- Doyou understand me?
- Yes, sir.
All right.
As far as Gene Irwin is concerned, it is
myjudgment he is as sane as you or I.
I wish he wasn't. He is.
Frankly, I'd like nothing more than
an excuse to get him out ofhere.
But I see the onlyway that's
gonna happen is ifyou request it.
That is true, sir.
Soyoujust-- You tell me
you can't handle him. He's gone.
Oh, I think
I can handle him, sir.
You watch yourself, Colonel.

Is that so?
Well, that's what men

Why areyou here, Yates?
I would likeyourversion.
I was involved in a drug-smuggling

You were ''involved.''
You ran it, did you not?

They cannot take away from us

[ Boisterous Cheers ]
[Irwin] Takealook
ata castle, any castle.
Now, break down the elements
thatmakeita castle.
Location. Protection.
Garrison. Flag.
The only differencebetween
this castleandall therest...
- is they werebuilt
tokeeppeople out.
- Forward. Ho.
This castle wasbuilt
tokeeppeople in.
But it's still a castle.
And any castle can be taken,
whetheryou're fighting
in the 1 4th century or the 21 st.
To succeed in a castle war,
you have to overcome
the garrison,
take thehigh ground...
andultimately
capture the flag.
Okay? Enriquez.
All right. You set up
a command post, okay?
And here, you have
the guard-- Well, here.
First ofall,
this is admin building,
Winter's office, guards.
Okay? Phase one,
neutralize Winter's guards.
Phase two, towers. Control the towers,
you control theyard.
Towerone, towertwo,
towerthree, towerfour.
Towerfouris Zamorro--
guyto watch.
Phase three,
water cannon.
Four, helicopter.
Helicopter's thehigh ground.
Takin' the helicopter's gonna
be a bitch. But it's doable.
Finally, the flag.
Capture the flag.
When we capture the flag,
it's raised upside down.
- Distress.
- Right.
Right. Upside down means,
''Send help.
The fort has fallen.''
We raise it upside down,
and keep it that way until
Wheeler arrives and sees it.
- Then, we've won.
- [ Chuckles ]
Yates, shut the fu--
You see what I mean about him?
Hey, Yates, whatare
youdoin'here, huh?
I don't know.
Ask him. He invited me.
General, I know, uh, his father
served with you in Vietnam,
butdo we really
needhim around?
Yeah. He stays.
- Duffy?Areyouinmaintenance?
- Yes, sir.
[ Chattering ]
Yates.
Got a minute?
How am I doin'?
Five-to-two,
in the colonel's favor.
- Well, you don't think I can win.
- He knows too--
He knows too much.
He's prepared. He's ready.
He may be prepared,
but he's not ready.
You know, we can useyou.
Hey, look, I just want
to survive this and go home.
- You make a deal with him?
- What?
That's what I would do.
Go toyou.
- He knows whatyou're capable of.
- Listen, man.
- But so do I.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, I know what
you're capable of.
- I knowyour type verywell.
- Is that right?
Is that from your infiniteyears
ofexperience on the battlefield?
Why doyou think I should helpyou?
Can you get me out ofhere?
- No.
- Then what areyou going to do for me?
Oh, you're going to make me a soldier
again? Is that whatyou're doing?
I get to be all I can be?
You gonna teach me to salute?
You know what? This is about
the time I would be giving you
my internal soldier speech.
But the truth is, you probably
never should have been a soldier.
Your fatherwas.
That's how I saw him.
You saw him as a disappointment.
Okay. Get past it.
That was then.
The only thing that matters here is...
what we are now
and what we do now.
This man is going toyou
because he sees the worst in you.
He's going to play for the worst.
I want to see the best.
That means there's no middle.
Now, these men need you.
And I need you.
Now, it's your choice.
And don't tell me
you're surviving here, Yates.
- You're hiding.
- [ Scoffs ]
[ Chuckling ]
- How's it going this evening, sir?
- Fine, Sergeant. How areyou?
Sir?
PrisonerYates
wishes to have a word.
Give me five minutes, Captain.
- [DoorCloses]
- [ Clears Throat ] Hi.
- Hi.
- [ Ringing ]
Colonel Winter's office.
Yeah. Yeah, go ahead
andjust send it up.
[DoorOpening, Closing]
Sir.
- Sir?
- Yes.
PrisonerYates.
[ Sighs ]
You want me to do
this thing foryou?
This 30 days-- This three months,
it's not gonna cut it.
I got to get out ofhere immediately.
I got to get out ofhere tomorrow.
I'm afraid
that's not possible.
Look, when this thing explodes,
everyone's gonna know it's me whoyakked.
And then my life's
worth nothing.
So, eitheryou get me out
ofhere immediately...
oryou find another guy
who knows as much as I do...
and who's willing to spill it.
Good luck.
The soonest I can getyou out
is one week.
Sir, I'm not gonna last--
I won't last seven seconds
let alone seven days.
Well, you can ride
the week out in the hole.
No one will
getyou there.
So what does Mr. Irwin
have planned for us?
He's planning
to take over the prison.
Really.
Well, that information
won't getyou released.
That information won't even get
you extra potatoes at lunch.
I know the details.
I know how he plans
to neutralizeyour men,
how he plans to take over the tower,
weapons and tools he's building.
- Doyou know when?

Place this man in the SHU.
No one talks to him.
No one sees him.

My mother's sick.
I'm trying to get a furlough.

[ Exhales Sharply]

threeyears in solitary confinement.
[ Exhales ]

Good morning.
So, what doyou

- Not much.
- Not much.
Then why areyou here?
I thought there was something
you might wanna know.
When they take over the prison,
they're going to fly the flag
upside down.
- Upside down?
- It's the international
sign ofdistress, sir.
Yes, I know what it means.
And where are they
going to get a flag?
They already have it. Yours.
Mine.
- Peretz, who was in hereyesterday?
- I took it, you murdering fuck.
I thoughtyou
were smarter than that.
Yes, I knowyou did.
[Groans]

They chained the doors

Yes. Icansee that.
It's gonna take 'em
a little while to get around.
When they get here, tell them
to gear up, but hold them.
They'll expect us to come
hard and fast, so we won't.
- [Gunshot]
- Whoa! Hey!
