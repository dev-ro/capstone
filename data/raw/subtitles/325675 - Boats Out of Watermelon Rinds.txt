"BOUTS OUT OF WATERMELON RINDS"
My son?
What's your name?
Recep.
Look at my face.
You are quite a good-looking boy.
If you happen to have any melons cracking,
put them in the can.
I have cows, I will feed them.
Bring the can when it's full, ok?
Let me snow you my house,come on.
I will feed the cows with the stuff.
This is my house.
Knock the handle on tne door and say
my name out loud OK?
What did she say to you?
Who?
Nezihe Wasn't she telling you something ?
She wants melons that crack
up for her cows.
It's aIways either the birds or the assholes
that get to eat Kemal's stuff anyways  .
Are these from Adana, Kemal ?
No, Uncle Salih, Diyarbakir
Why didn't you bring them from
Adana this year?
Adana or Diyarbakir...  They are all same.
No tricks in Kemal's meIons.
Check it ...
What's this ? Can't we even trust a melon
in this worId?
It's okay as long as it doesn't get sold
off to a customer.
-Take it.
-Thank you, I don't want it.
Why not ? It's doesn't belong to an orphan.
- How is it?
- LIke honey...
Shall I weigh up five kilos?
Not much time before prayers.
Afterwards, if God willing  .
- Master
- Yeah?
Can you give me some money?
What're you gonna do with money?
I'm gonna buy some paint and a brush
What's up?
What's the brush and paint for?
I'm gonna paint a sign and hang it right
there on the tree.
-You know how to do that?
-I'm a painter.
Painter? Good. All Me needed is a sign.
Never seen a painter before?
You are quite a painter.Look at the melons!
Who could tell them from real ones?
You made tne seeds too?
ShouId I write "Watermelon Man" here?
No. Write "The Happy WatermeIon Man."
And here, "A kilo for 75"
Good job. You should have gone to school.
Sister!
Auntie!
-This is yours.
-What is it?
Your mother brought it to our stand.
-Who are you?
-Apprentice to the watermelon man.
Mother!A boy brought you a tin can.
Take it girl, don't leave the boy waiting.
Thanks, my son.
Who was that?
Tne apprentice. He brought watermelon
rinds.
Did mom start begging around now for
watermelon
rinds?
Now the gypsy boys are coming to our
house.
He is not a gypsy. He is the vendor's
apprentice
Her mother's daughter, that's what she is...
Here you are, brother.
-Good evening
-Good bye.
Master, it's late. Can I go?
Ok! boy, you can go.
Master, my friend is waitIng, can I go now?
Did you take the bread up to my house?
Yes, I did.
- Was the auntie home?
- Yes, she was.
-You can go then.
-Good-bye.
What's up?
If I don't ask, he never remembers himself.
My master is a cool man.
You should have gone to the tailor's,
that's a clean job.
There's more money in the barber's
business.
All you need is water and some soap.
I also want to learn to extract a tooth and to
circumcise.
I wouIdn't touch the dirty dicks even for a
hundred bucks.
The tailor's was a clean job.Did he beat
you up again today?
Hit on my head a couple of times.
There is a saying:"The barber cuts
the hair of bald men, his hands smell
all dirty amen ".
What're you gonna do with all that cash?
We're gonna open a movie theatre,
aren't we?
We're building the machine ourselves.
We don't need that much cash.All that's
missing is some chairs.
They get to see movies in a village, what's
up with asking for chairs?
Oh, is it you, crazy boy?
You scared  us,buddy.
We wonder if you were still a partner or not.
He is a real man and does not
change his mind.
The only thing is, he doesn't change his
torchlight for ours.
-We're gonna put it on the machine.
-Nope...
- Let's change It with ours.
- Nope
Turn off your light.
Mon shouldn't see us.We should put the
ladder away before we leave.
If she gets suspicious, she'll burn
our films again.
Direct your light to the candle.
Hold the film, and pull it real fast.
This time we're definitely gonna hit 24
frames.
Ready.Let's go.
You think we can't get 24 frames per
second?
I bet it was even 124.
Then you couldn't do a proper shutter.
How else am I supposed to do...
My arms are dead...
-Come and do it yourself.
-Ok, let me try.
Should we read that book again?
No need, we memorized the whole thing.
Move away! Do we have to watch out for
you too?
Let him snake it if he wants to.
Maybe then we will catch the motion.
You hold your hands here.
Right in front of mine.
Here we go.Start!
Move,son of a bitch.
Move,moveey move,moveey!
Stop being silly.This man has to move.
in the name of God !
Recep!
What?
Have you lit Granddad's candles?
I forgot.I will do it right away, mom.
You never forget to play with tne pictures.All
we have is Fatner Gayi in this whole world.
All you need to do is light two candles.
Stop messing with that moovey, you will
scare away our good luck.
Granddad.Give us a hand.We've been
pulling them like crazy.
We really do hit 24 frames per second,
but still there's no movement.
Oh, I almost forgot.
There's a girl called Nihal in the
neighborhood where we sell watermelons
She's so beautiful.
She's actually oIder than me, but who
cares...  If I could ever take her and
we have a boy...
...I would name him after you.
"Suleyman..."
Mehmet,look.DId we take the ladder
away from the wall last night?
Why are you asking?
Why are you asking why?
If my mom sees the ladder, she'll find
our films and burn them.
-Don't say that.
-The films are gone again... Shit!
It is my fault to trust you.
If I give you four sheeps to herd, I'm sure
you will lose two of them.
Find a better place to hide the stuff.
Let's not forget to take out our hats.
Are the buns fresh?
Poor boy,eating himself  with plain bread.
Hurry up, come up to my house, at least
you'll have tea with your roll.
Thank you auntie, but it's all right...
Come on, you will.Why do you want
to eat dry bread?
- The master could arrive.
- Let him arrive.
You'll have your tea before he arrives.
Sit down here.Have your glass of tea
and leave in good time.
Good-looking rascal.Dry bread in the
morning is no good.
Nihal, go get some tea for the boy.
Sister, who is that?
Mon's relatives.
Here, take this tea.
We are feeding the poor.
You should become my son will you ?
Good-looking rascal.
God gave me two girls, but no boy.How
many brothers and sisters are you?-Three.
-All boys?
-Two boys and a girl.
One boy is enough for a household.
Your mother should give you to us.
All right?
-Ha, is it all right?
-A right.
Don't stay hungry.Where do you
eat lunch?
At the shop We eat watermelon
and cheese.
That's good.Don't stay hungry.
So, he will play moveey ha?
What a difficult job it is to raise a son all
alone?
Don't know how he got into this devil's
invention.
It is the genies pulling it, I know.They can't
do anything.
I have the tomb of Father Gayi at
my house.
What's going on? You are sleeping
standing up like a milkman's horse...
You allmost fell off  the chair, boy.
Did you rock a cradle till morning like I did?
I started dozing off too
I'll go home and take a little nap.
If anyone asks for me, tell them that
I will be back.
What's this, crazy man, is this a
new habit?
Do we need circus performances?
You God-damn mule!
Are we here to do circus performance?
You God-damn mule!
Why are you making strange faces?
Here I am trying to teach you an art,
and all you do is fool around.
If you won't behave, then get the fuck off!
Have you ever seen any other village
folk get to be artisans? Let them
work their fields.
Shall I ask the price of the camera?
ShouId have become apprentice to the
photographer.You think there's money in it?
Maybe he needs an apprentice.
I should ask.
Forget it.He has a sour face just
like your master.
I'll ask him anyways.Wait here a minute.
He said,"I hardly feed myseIf."
Told ya.Did you ask the price of the
camera?
I did.He said they're no good for us.
So they're good for his mother?
Us being villagers, these city folk think a
camera is too much for our hands.
We keep working like a mule and they take
photographs.
Fuck it We'll build our own machine.
Oh, man...  They must be our films.
- What films?
- Look !
Come here, I swear I won't beat you.
God damn it.You couldn't even hide
them in a good place, man.
You guys,what do you want?
Can we take a closer look at the machine?
I have no time, mind your own business.
Ask for film strips to be thrown away.
What do you want this time?
Have you got any strips of film to be
thrown away?
Take it and get the hell out of here.
I can't deal with you two.No more
knocking on this door.
What the hell are you two doing there?
Fuck off, you rascals
Here we go.
Pull! Pull!
The time has come I'm sure the
man will move.
Come on!
Move!
The film is over.
Forget it.It will not move.
Even if we use a projection machine,
that man will not move.
The master is real dirty.
Why doesn't he use an ashtray?
- Boy my mom is calling you.
- For what?
She says you should come and
have some tea.
I was very late today.My master will
scream at me.You can have the tin can.
My mom said don't come back without
him.You have to have some tea.
Do the watermelons come from
your village? What?
-Do the watermelons grow in your field?
-Nope.
-Where do they grow?
-in Adana.
-What's grown in your village?
-Walnuts, plums, mulberries,...
...cherries and cornelian cherries.
Bring me some cornelian cherries
from the viIIage?
They are not ripe yet.
-Then bring me walnuts.
-All right.
-Can you bring them tomorrow?
-All right.
-What is the name of your village?
-"Flirting Birds Village"
- You nave birds there?
- Yeah.
-Do they flirt?
-Yeah.
-Small birds?
-Very small, but not that small.
Is the watermelon man your father?
- Nope .My father died in the military
- Mine too.
His dead body was sent over by
the miIitary.
We were very rich at
those times.
Why are you pinching me? Mommy!...
What now?
-Strange boys are coming to our house.
Shut up !
-Don't want him here !
-Do not to speak so loud to me !
-Your little daughter is pIaying with boys.
-He is such a young kid.
-He is a stranger
-You are embarrassing me!
-I don't want him here.
-Shut up, I said !
Do not want him here! That's it!
Granddad are you there?
Things are not going well here.
This girl is going to kill me.
She looks down upon me.
You'd better no to ask about the
cinema matter.
We are in big trouble.
The pictures are not moving though we
make twenty four frames per second.
Granddad, you must help us
What's in the bag?
Walnuts.
Are you going to open a walnut shop
next to the watermelons?
No man, it's something eIse
What?
Just something else
You're keeping a secret from me?
As you wish.
There's a girl in the neighborhood,
she asked for them.
-What girl?
-It's just a girl.
Her mother gives me tea in the mornings,
and I bring them walnuts.
Don't fall in love with her?
No man, she is too young.
She has mucus oozing out of her nose.
-How old is she?
-Fourteen, fifteen.
And how old are you? When did
your mucus dry out?
-Is she beautiful?
-Very beautiful.
But her older sIster,NInal,
she's even more beautiful.
So you're in love with her then?
- How old is she?
- Maybe twenty.
So you'll marry her and call
her mother, ha?
It is non of your business.
What is it, girI?
Recep!
I brought walnuts.
Motner,Recep bnrought walnuts!
Walnut ?... Walnut ?
- My mom is calling you,Recep.
- What is it?
-You are going to have tea.
-I had tea at the village.
-Then you will have some food.
-I had food, too.
-Come on, my mom is calling you.
-No, thank you.
Fine.
I won't have your tea.
You think I'm a beggar?
-Recep, what are you doing here?
-Nothing.
-Nothing? Are you ill?
-Nope.
Come on, get up, we'll have tea.
-I had some in village, auntie
-You'll have some here, too.
You were my so, dId you forget?
Or did you change your mind?
Look at my face you good-lookIng rascal.
Come on, we'll have tea.
What happened ?
Or I'll slap the back of your neck.
Come on, my good looking rascal.
-Auntie, my master could come.
-Do not worry.
You finish before he comes.
He never comes before eleven o'clock.
Come here.
Sit next to me.
Right there.
You were supposed to become my son,
you forgot too quickly.
Let me put some cream on your bread.
Plain bread is no good.
My good looking rascal.
Your hair is very beautiful.
Soft like silk.
I like it.
-What do you use when you wash
your hair? -Hair clay.
Look at her bird's nest.
It won't accept a comb.
Auntie, I should go.
No, I won't let you.
You'll have your meal first.
Don't look so careful my boy,
the mirror will break.
"The champions who started the game very
fast..."
"...scored early with Sanli..."
"...but couId not score again in the
rest of the game..."
"...the guest team equalized..."
Master I'm gonna buy a comb and a mirror,
can you give me some money?
Mirror and comb?
Where did this come from, mirror and comb?
Is there a hot situation?
What?
-Are you in love with the girIs?
-No, master, I swear.
You liar...Lying without feelling ashamed ?
The girls are beautiful, aren't they?
Man shouldn't ashamed of his master.
-The girls are beautiful, aren't they?
-They are.
-And their mother is beautiful, too, isn't she?
-She is.
Then I'll take their mother, and you'll be my
son-in-law.
All right.
Here you go.
Get me a pack of cigarette as well.
Don't be late, OK?
From now on we'll get along fine with you.
After all, we'll be famiIy.
What're you doing?
Good thing the master didn't see me.
I must have dozed off.
The master is here!
Say "I'm here for a hair-cut".
I came for a hair-cut.
Come on, cut your friend's hair,
let's see if you got it.
How do you want it?
Shorten it up just a little.
I don't know how to shorten it yet.
Just cut it off
What's hair good for at his age?
Use number three my son!
I said number three!

He is still pIaying !
Don't have him cut it off too deeply.
I don't like it that way.
Are you gonna pay for its seeds?
It'll grow back.
Besides your friend will get practiced.
Did you ever see me starting the haircut
from there? Start from the back of the neck!
Mom,enough,my eyes are burning,mother!
Will you stop moving?
Shut up.You hairy Iittle brat.
Not that one! The other bottle .
We don't use that bottle on every customer.
Just on the very special ones.
Do your friend a favour.
Give it to your friend. He deserves it.
-No need.
-I said you deserved it!
-No need
-Take the money, come on!
You are looking like a star.
And you were telling that you didn't
like short hair.
If they ask you where the cologne is
from, tell them you got it at Kamil
the barber's shop.
What were you going to do with Iong and
dirty hair, you peasent boy?
What did you do to your head, boy?
Come here!
Sit down.
What is that, a pumpkin?
Look at my face.
Why did you have it shaved off?
It's nothing.
Nothing? You just bought a mirror and
a comb this morning.
TeII me now, why did you get it shaved?
Nothing...
Does a man hide anything from his
father-in-law?
The cologne is cool, by the way.
It smells good.
What happened to the hair, really?
Tell me now.
All right, it's your business.
Damn it! Look at this face.
Shameless bastard!
Comb your mom with this!
ShameIess bastard!
-Take it.
-What's this?
-The hair-cut fee.
-I won't take it.
Yo deserved it man
Yo messed it up real bad.
They say the inexperienced blacksmith
learns the trade on infidels' horses.
How am I gonna look at Nihal's face now,
my man?
It's all over.
Go and fall in love with the younger girl then.
She likes you already.
Here, take your money.
I won't.
What kind of thing that to say?
Take the young one?
Could such a thing be posibble?
I can't live without NihaI,
I swear.
I offered her walnuts and she wouldn't
take them.
It was obvious that she was
no good for you.
-Here, take the money.
-I won't.
She's no good for me?
Of course she is.
If only I couId make that movie...
Now, I'm a wretched watermelon boy.
I'll become a director,
and then you'll see what happens.
What difference would it make, man?
Her eyes are set high up.
Who's high up?
I'm saying I'll be a movie-man.
-When will this hair grow back, my man?
-In two months, I guess.
What? The watermelon season will be over
by then. I'll be back in the village.
It's the pumpkin season now .
Thanks to you.
Maybne tne girl would have given in.
Now I have to go and guard the village?
Won't we come down to town to go to a
movie?
You'll see her then.
Here, take the money.
I'm ruined for sure, man .This morning I'd
bought a mirror and a comb.
My master gave ne one of his older
white shirts.
Her mother kept saying,
how beautiful my hair is.
She would definitely give me the girl.
She used to say, you be my son.
I'm really ruined.
Enough, boy.
Here, take your money.
I won't.
You wont?
I'll throw it in the ditch then.
Don't do that, man.
I ain't got a single penny left.
-Take it, then.
-You keep it.
Now I am the baldboy of the village.
And the pictures don't move.
Forget it, sit down.
OK guys, start loading these.
- Shall I nelp them master?
- Let the bastards carry tnemselves.
-Count it, will ya?
-It's all right.
Count it even when you find it on the ground.
It's all right, I said.
-GIve out your blessing
- Bless you.
Put this in front ,so It won't get bnreak.
Hey, be careful.
Where's the 250 gr weight?
- Tne 250 gram  weignt is missing
- Look arond.
Take this.
-No, master. Forget it.
Take it! Or I won't care if you're my
son-in-law and beat you up.
If you ride a boat made out of  waternelon
rinds yo're bound to sink soon.
Take care.
Recep, keep on with the school!
What are you doing with those?
- We'll play them
- Play them?
How will you do that?
Come here.
- We're building a machine.
- Machine?
What is this machine Iike?
It's out of wood.
There's a light inside.
It won't do it.
I tried it too in the past.
All in vain...
It was only a shadow theatre.
Look tnere's some more film in tne
wooden boxes.
You can  take those too.
Make tnem move if you can.
We have them arrive half dead anyways.
The film broke fifty times last night.
And the audience started chanting,
"dance Kadir, dance."
Like I tear tnem  up on purpose.
Mister,can I take this poste, too? It's torn.
Let me see.
Take it.
Go and find yourself a proper job.
This cinema business can not be
done with wooden boxes.
What did you do, boy?
The bastard almost tore it off.
-What did you do?
-We went broke.
-What did you break?
-We went bankrupt.
Where did this come from,
all of a sudden?
We're broke, man,
don't you get it?
If you ride a boat made out of watermelon
rinds you're bound to sink.
My master he was a cool guy.
And I couIdn't see Nihal.
I was gonna give her a Ietter,
four pages long.
You can't give her anytning.
-All because of you.
-Why's that?
Just go ahead.
Say "I love you."
Is anyone holding you?
How am I gonna face her,
looking like a pumpkin?
Don't keep saying "it's because of you"
I can take the letter to her for you.
-Do you have it with you?
-Yeah .But she wouldn't take it.
Why not?
She's not one of those girls.
I wish she would.
- Let me give it to her and we'll see
- Ok ,Take It to her.
They're all the same.
I'm gonna talk to the girl, for sure.
Just so I'm not to blame anymore.
It is sickening me.
Put the blame on master ,not me.
It's sickening me.
Sister, remember the watermelon boy...
What about him?
Recep, the watermelon salesman's
apprentice...
Are you dumb, boy?
What do I care about Recep?
He's really in love with you.
You fall in love with him a little, too.
He wrote you this letter, look...
Fuck off! Or I'll hand you to the police.
You foll!
-What happened, did you see her?
-I did.
-Swear on it
-I saw her I swear.
What happened to your face?
There's nothing wrong with my face.
Nothing wrong? It is roasted Iike toast
bread. Did they beat you?
- My master dId
- When?
-Just now
-Why? Didn't you run off from work, man?
He saw me in the neighborhood of your girIs
and beat me out in the street.
-Anyways. Did Nihal take the letter?
-She did.
-And?... -I just gave it
I don't care about the rest.
-Didn't she say anything? -She took the
letter and put it inside her blouse.
-You swear?
Do I owe you a lie?
-What did she say? -Nothing What if
she handed me to the police?
Come on, let's go to our village.
What have we got from this town?
From the girls or from the watermelons?
These town girIs, they're all the same.
-Not Nihal. Except for her.
-Except for Nihal.
All the others are bitches.
God-damn town.
We end up gazing at you from afar.
After watermelons and stuff,
we are back at being shepard boys.
You are rignt.
If we get to be moviemen and make a film,
you think Nihal would come to me?
What do you need Nihal for,
when you have all the actresses?
Still...
Nihal is different...
We should just follow those train tracks and
take off from here.
-Where to?
-As far as we can go...
They say that pain of the heart is
comforted by traveling.
Mehmet ,I say you should talk to the gIrl.
- Who NInal?
- Yeah.
Ask her"do you have an answer to the
letter?"
This is as far as I go, brother.
I won't go near them again.
If anything good is gonna come,
it'll come from cinema.
You're rignt man.
When do you think Nihal will write an
answer?
Dunno.
What's the hurry?
I've walked by their house a hundred times,
nothing happens.
You could go to her, and ask her.
No way. My duty is over.
The rest is up to you.
Time will come when I'll do you a favour.
Nope .She might take me to the police.
Why shouId she do that, man? If she were to
do that, she wouIdn't have taken the letter.
Dunno. If I were you,
I wouIdn't go either.
-Why?
-Just because...
I have to go.
I don't care if you come or not.
If you are my friend ,don't go there
Listen to me.
"...Every frame on the film remains still for
one-forty eighths of a second...
"...and leaves its place for the following
frame."...in film projectors..."
"...this function of generating
movements with stops..."
"...is performed by a mechanism called
"Maltese Cross,..."
"...MaItese Cross has four slots on it and
the sliding film is stopped by it..."
Remains still for one forty eights of a
second...
One forty eights of a second...
Here is, the picture moved finally.
Of course...And we pull on the strip like
crazy.
Turn off your lights.
The pictures moved, I swear.
-Do not lie.
-Turn off your lights!
-I swear they did.
-How?
Come and see.
Hit him!
Hit the bastards!
They're really moving, man!
The picture must have remained still for
one-forty eigths of a second.
One more time.
One more time.
It's easy for you to say.
Hand me your flashIight then.
Nope.
Granddad, are you there?
The pictures moved.
I swear.
If you could see...
It was our fault.
We were pulling on the film like crazy.
Turns out the film has to pass through the
light in stuttered movements.
Thanks, granddad.
We couIdn't do it without your help?
Look at that!
"MOVEEY BOYS"
Who wrote this?
We don't know big brother.
I swear we didn't.
Stop it!...
Turn off the lights.
Uncle Ali Dede came to look at the moveey.
Did you come to look at the moveey?
It's just a shadow.
Uncle, sit down, we can't see.
We can't see.
Sit down, we can't see!
Who invented this word "moveey", ha?
We got to be known as "moveey boys".
What's up with that?
Cinema is what this is called, cinema.
The batteries are out.
We have to go down to town.
Let's also check out tne theatre
for new film strips.
Don't go near the girl's neighborhood,
though.
Why not?
My naster might see me.
He can't.
Thay are the opposite sides of town.
Still, just in case.
I hope the cinema man has cut off
lots of pieces.
Also, let's take 50 pennies from
the audience .We have no money
for the batteries.
Why don't I go and see the girI tonight?
I'll tell her everything.
-Don't go there.
-Why not?
She might take you to the police.
Let her do It.
This is love.
-These are the ones that play on the
moveey? -Yeah.
How do they get to move?
It's our job...
Can this move too?
Who is this, you infidel?
- My fiancee
- Wno's your fiancee?
She's dead.
This three battery flashlight of yours...
If you give that to us,
we'll make your fiancee move.
-Will she come out of the grave?
-No, she won't
What do you want the one in the grave?
This picture will move, isn't that enough?
Yo're the man partner.
Let it move.
Not now.
Did you ever see it move during the day?
Come here when it's dark.
And your fiancee will come here too.
All right?
I am waiting for you here.
I am not going anywhere.
I am warning you once again. Forget her.
Think about cinema only.
You go if  you want.
No, I'm waiting for you.
Auntie Nezihe is not home?
They have moved away a while ago, son.
Where to?
Somewhere like Balikesir or Eskisehir.
Nezihe got married.
Maybe to Kutanya,
I don't know.
The girIs left, too?
She wouIdn't leave them here.
She just took them and left.
It's hard times now.
And the girls have grown up.
Sooner or later they're gonna
get married too.
Are you Nezihe's relative?
No, I used to bring watermelon rinds
for her cows.
No cows left, son
.She sold them all.
Nuriye!
Do you hear me?
The Izmir train passed through.
It's midnight.
Let's go to our village.
Told you not to go there.
Didn't I?
These town girIs are like cats,
nobody can deal with them.
Even Mehmet the Wrestler couIdn't
deal with those cats.
Nuriye, I'm cold.
Come out, if you will.
I don't want to get sick.
We used to meet with you near the barn,
before you died.
Enough already
Don't be child.
Aren't there any other girls for you?
I thought, if she ever came back...
...She shouldn't wait out in the cold.
This is Omer's doing.
It's our fault.
Walking with the crazy upsets the stomach.
We couldn't just pay for the damn
three-battery torch.
Let's go to tne beach and watch the sea,
we'll feel better.
There's nothing better than the beach.
Yeah really.
Look at the sea!
Makes a man feel good insIde.
If only we had some money and
bought that 8mm camera.
I already wrote a script.
What's it like?
Very nice. Listen.
A winter night...
There's a lonely water-mill worker.
He has someone knocking his door at
midnight.
"I have grain to be processed."
The man is scared.
How couldn't he be scared?
He says "what is this sound?"
The water-mill worker lies down
in his bed, scared.
The same voice repeates loudly...
..."Hey, mill- worker, I have grain to be
processed!"
Nothing like the beach, man!
We don't have such a friend.
You ,go on with your story.
The mill-worker gets up from his bed.
There is a terrible snowstorm outside.
The mill-worker does not open the door.
He has realized that these are not real men.
-Genies?
-Who knows?
The man is yelling from one side and
the storm from the other side.
How much is this 8mm camera anyways?
