<b>Hey you rat! You push me!</b>
<b>Don't you know my crime history?</b>
<b>You will not cross your limits here!</b>
<b>l am sorry, Sir.</b>
<b>Jailer, this slap will cost you dear.</b>
<b>lt's you, my daughter?</b>
<b>- How are you?</b>
<b>l am fine. l had been thinking</b>
<b>about you since morning.</b>
<b>That's a lie!</b>
<b>Why didn't you call me, then?</b>
<b>Well dear...</b>
<b>No more explanations over the phone.</b>
<b>The rest of the case will take place in person,</b>
<b>which will be today.</b>
<b>What kind ofjoke is this?</b>
<b>You are in Bombay and...</b>
<b>l am here and you can</b>
<b>reach me in five minutes..</b>
<b>Really?!</b>
<b>l shall be there in a jiffy.</b>
<b>l am glad to see you here.</b>
<b>But how did you plan this visit suddenly?</b>
<b>One has to make time to visit</b>
<b>someone dear to you.</b>
<b>See how l made time for you in spite</b>
<b>of being a magazine's editor.</b>
<b>How?</b>
<b>Yours is the oldest prison in lndia.</b>
<b>l told my boss that</b>
<b>l want to write an article...</b>
<b>...about prisons during the British era</b>
<b>and their present conditions.</b>
<b>He gave me the permission.</b>
<b>- You are very shrewd.</b>
<b>So, when will you take me</b>
<b>around your prison?</b>
<b>Won't you talk to your daddy first?</b>
<b>l will.</b>
<b>- Then, today's your day with me.</b>
<b>Visit the jail tomorrow.</b>
<b>Mr. Sharma where do we begin?</b>
<b>- From that barrack.</b>
<b>What is that?</b>
<b>- The kitchen.</b>
<b>Then let us start from there.</b>
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>Do you give such good for prisoners?</b>
<b>- Yes dear.</b>
<b>We give 250 grams rice and 500 grams of Lentil daily.</b>
<b>And 100 grams of meat every Tuesday.</b>
<b>We give the inmates food thrice a day.</b>
<b>They cook the food.</b>
<b>She is the jailor's daughter.</b>
<b>- What!</b>
<b>What is this furnace for?</b>
<b>- To prepare pancakes.</b>
<b>There are two...</b>
<b>Leave me!</b>
<b>Leave me!</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>By drawing the line to protect her,</b>
<b>you cannot stop me.</b>
<b>You had so much fire in your eyes</b>
<b>when you were hitting yesterday.</b>
<b>Vishal, l read your file yesterday.</b>
<b>l cannot believe, you are a murderer.</b>
<b>You must have taken the blame</b>
<b>under some pressure.</b>
<b>l have killed, not one,</b>
<b>but four people and l have no regrets.</b>
<b>l am very content.</b>
<b>But what compelled you to commit</b>
<b>such a grave crime?</b>
<b>What will you do knowing my story.</b>
<b>l am a journalist.</b>
<b>l'll reach your story to the public...</b>
<b>You want to sell my story</b>
<b>and earn a name.</b>
<b>No, Vishal. lt isn't so.</b>
<b>- l do not want to revive my past.</b>
<b>Why are you compelling me?</b>
<b>l have managed to forget everything</b>
<b>with great difficulty.</b>
<b>l want to know everything only as a friend.</b>
<b>Maybe, you don't feel anything.</b>
<b>But l have formed a bond of friendship.</b>
<b>Oan't l even share the sorrow</b>
<b>of the one who saved my chastity?</b>
<b>l will not pressurize you to tell me</b>
<b>if you do not wish to.</b>
<b>l'm going to Bombay today.</b>
<b>Listen...</b>
<b>Till today,</b>
<b>l never revealed my past before anyone.</b>
<b>Maybe, l never met anyone,</b>
<b>before whom l could show my wounds.</b>
<b>But you...!</b>
<b>My life used to be colortul.</b>
<b>High hopes. And great dreams.</b>
<b>''You wear no flowers or</b>
<b>a necklace of pearls''</b>
<b>''You have not adorned yourself</b>
<b>yet you look so beautiful''</b>
<b>''Love fills my heart</b>
<b>love fills my body''</b>
<b>''Love fills my life</b>
<b>you are my loved one''</b>
<b>''The beauty of your</b>
<b>youth adore as you.</b>
<b>''Your youth is your asset''</b>
<b>''You are the freshness of the flowers''</b>
<b>''You are so simple''</b>
<b>''The wind carries the fragrance</b>
<b>of you when you walk''</b>
<b>''The sitar begins to play</b>
<b>when you speak''</b>
<b>''Your body is like gold</b>
<b>your smile, like pearl''</b>
<b>''Your lips are so intoxicating</b>
<b>you are the flame of beauty''</b>
<b>''Your face is like an idol</b>
<b>which l see every time''</b>
<b>Sorry, brother-in-law,</b>
<b>you had to wait.</b>
<b>What are you wearing to college?</b>
<b>lsn't it nice, sister?</b>
<b>l bought it yesterday.</b>
<b>ls this a dress</b>
<b>or a swimming costume?</b>
<b>As you grow older,</b>
<b>your dresses are becoming that much shorter.</b>
<b>You've started lecturing me again!</b>
<b>...make her understand.</b>
<b>Be quiet!</b>
<b>This decent man is going to be beaten,</b>
<b>torn between two women!</b>
<b>lt's getting late.</b>
<b>This is Tony...Tony,</b>
<b>he is my brother-in-law.</b>
<b>We're late for class. Let's go</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>You are always late.</b>
<b>- Yes, l am.</b>
<b>But you look stunning today, Rita.</b>
<b>Rita is giving me sleepless nights.</b>
<b>She is a bomb!</b>
<b>But she does not even let us touch her.</b>
<b>Our wishes will be fulfilled if</b>
<b>she comes for my birthday bash tomorrow.</b>
<b>l'll arrange that.</b>
<b>- How?</b>
<b>We will fire by keeping</b>
<b>the gun on Tony's shoulder!</b>
<b>You know them.</b>
<b>Tony, you have added life</b>
<b>to the party by bringing Rita.</b>
<b>But remember your promise.</b>
<b>- lt's a man's word.</b>
<b>Here is your stuff.</b>
<b>Go inside.</b>
<b>Do not add too much,</b>
<b>or she will lose her senses.</b>
<b>This is the only way to get her.</b>
<b>- Or she won't let us touch her.</b>
<b>Really? Then add some more.</b>
<b>- Sure.</b>
<b>l do not drink alcohol.</b>
<b>- lt is not alcohol.</b>
<b>Where is Tony?</b>
<b>- ln the bathroom. Shall we dance?</b>
<b>Where is Tony?</b>
<b>No !</b>
<b>For God's sake, leave me!</b>
<b>What happened with Rita</b>
<b>at the party last night?</b>
<b>Those people...</b>
<b>- Who were they?</b>
<b>They drugged Rita.</b>
<b>What are their names?</b>
<b>One last question to the witness.</b>
<b>Whom amongst these four decent men</b>
<b>raped Rita first?</b>
<b>The witness has no sufficient answers</b>
<b>for any of my questions.</b>
<b>My Lord, do not misunderstand</b>
<b>the silence of my witness.</b>
<b>As per the post-mortem,</b>
<b>Rita had sex.</b>
<b>You were present at the place of action...</b>
<b>then why have you not</b>
<b>answered the defense lawyer?</b>
<b>Weren't you present there?</b>
<b>l was in the other room.</b>
<b>Were you taking drugs in the other room?</b>
<b>What are you saying, lawyer?</b>
<b>The rape took place in Tony's presence.</b>
<b>Please sit.</b>
<b>Let me do my work.</b>
<b>You are a drug addict.</b>
<b>As per the report,</b>
<b>Rita too had drugs.</b>
<b>l am speaking the truth, ain't l?</b>
<b>ls it true that</b>
<b>you took Rita to the party?</b>
<b>ls it also true that</b>
<b>the both of you wanted to marry?</b>
<b>ls it also true that you raped her?</b>
<b>- Yes... No ! No!</b>
<b>Whatever happened to Rita,</b>
<b>happened with both their consent.</b>
<b>To increase their fire of lust,</b>
<b>they took drugs.</b>
<b>Rita's death was due to drugs,</b>
<b>and not because of rape.</b>
<b>This is a lie!</b>
<b>He is making the case weak to save them!</b>
<b>My sister was a decent girl.</b>
<b>Be quiet.Sit down.</b>
<b>l do not want to be responsible for the death...</b>
<b>of these innocent people</b>
<b>by proving a lie to be the truth.</b>
<b>Tell us your verdict.</b>
<b>The Oourt has reached a verdict,...</b>
<b>that the charges made on these four boys...</b>
<b>for the rape of Rita Sinha is false and baseless.</b>
<b>The court acquits these four boys.</b>
<b>And sentences Tony to 3 months</b>
<b>imprisonment...</b>
<b>for presenting a false case.</b>
<b>Ooming, Vishal.</b>
<b>Why are you here?</b>
<b>- To give you justice.</b>
<b>We are not happy with</b>
<b>the court's verdict.</b>
<b>The court has not done a wise</b>
<b>thing by acquitting us.</b>
<b>Now will be the real fun.</b>
<b>Do not move further!</b>
<b>Stop! l say, do not move!</b>
<b>Or l will kill you.</b>
<b>We won't move.</b>
<b>- Do not move ahead!</b>
<b>We won't.</b>
<b>- Stop!</b>
<b>For God's sake, stop.</b>
<b>What happened? Who did this?</b>
<b>Rita's killers.</b>
<b>Punish...</b>
<b>But you were incredible, Khanna.</b>
<b>You turned the case</b>
<b>despite being a Public Prosecutor.</b>
<b>And proved the witness</b>
<b>as the culprit.</b>
<b>That is why, l quote my price.</b>
<b>Bearing in mind, the culprit pleading</b>
<b>guilty and the witnesses' testimony</b>
<b>the court sentences</b>
<b>Vishal Agnihotri...</b>
<b>for the murder of Bobby Singh,</b>
<b>Romi Ghrewal...</b>
<b>Sweety Bhagwat and Jaggi Ohopra...</b>
<b>to life imprisonment as</b>
<b>per the lndian Penal Oode 302.</b>
<b>You have been inflicted</b>
<b>with injustice.</b>
<b>You were compelled to do</b>
<b>what you did..</b>
<b>There was no other way out.</b>
<b>More injustice is being inflicted</b>
<b>by keeping you behind bars.</b>
<b>What is left for me in the</b>
<b>outside world now?</b>
<b>There is no aim left in life now.</b>
<b>Time is the greatest healer.</b>
<b>Even if you wish, you cannot keep</b>
<b>away from this world.</b>
<b>l shall bring your unfair story</b>
<b>before the world.</b>
<b>l shall strive hard</b>
<b>to have you released.</b>
<b>What are you publishing daily, Roma?</b>
<b>How can a murderer sentenced to</b>
<b>life imprisonment be innocent?</b>
<b>Our paper is being maligned</b>
<b>because of you.</b>
<b>Mr Jindal won't spare me.</b>
<b>But l'll put the onus on you.</b>
<b>You face the music!</b>
<b>Mr Siddiqui...</b>
<b>it is Sir's phone.</b>
<b>Ask him to call in the evening!</b>
<b>lt is Mr Jindal's phone.</b>
<b>Roma is in front of me. l was</b>
<b>scolding her for the article...</b>
<b>You have given permission to Roma?</b>
<b>The public response is good?</b>
<b>And the paper is selling</b>
<b>like hot cakes?</b>
<b>l will tell Roma. Right away.</b>
<b>Mr Jindal has congratulated</b>
<b>you and me.</b>
<b>He has fixed your appointment with</b>
<b>the Oommissioner for today.</b>
<b>Why are you glorifying a murderer</b>
<b>like Vishal Agnihotri?</b>
<b>Write about me instead.</b>
<b>The court sentenced Vishal and</b>
<b>he has been punished too.</b>
<b>Oan l have the file, Sir?</b>
<b>Mr Jindal personally called,</b>
<b>so l will have to give you the file.</b>
<b>But you will have to</b>
<b>meet Amar Saxena for that.</b>
<b>He has the criminal</b>
<b>records of Zone 3.</b>
<b>Where can l meet</b>
<b>Amar Saxena?</b>
<b>He is always busy on duty.</b>
<b>But you can get his whereabouts</b>
<b>And where will l find</b>
<b>constable Kashinath Sahu?</b>
<b>Haven't you ever seen a girl?</b>
<b>Hey, fat so!</b>
<b>Order for a cold drink.</b>
<b>l shall show anything</b>
<b>that you want to see, later. Go.</b>
<b>Go!</b>
<b>- l will.</b>
<b>What do you want?</b>
<b>Who are you?</b>
<b>l think, you do not know me.</b>
<b>lf you did, then wouldn't you</b>
<b>offer me a chair to sit?</b>
<b>Good people of Gol Ohowky serve me.</b>
<b>Hey! l don't care who serve you!</b>
<b>Understand?</b>
<b>Why are you getting angry?</b>
<b>l am a woman.</b>
<b>lf l lose my head, then</b>
<b>it will prove you dear.</b>
<b>Soft drink?</b>
<b>- l do not drink!</b>
<b>Please!</b>
<b>- l do not drink!</b>
<b>Look! l have a bag full.</b>
<b>l used to buy things from</b>
<b>Heerakutty before.</b>
<b>But the goods were bad.</b>
<b>The customers would shout at me.</b>
<b>And Ohampa Rani can change men,</b>
<b>not customers.</b>
<b>Soft drink?</b>
<b>- All right, if you say so.</b>
<b>Do you want goods worth this much?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>When l start a new deal, l pay</b>
<b>Rs.100 more as a good omen.</b>
<b>All right, give.</b>
<b>l am taking this only as a sample.</b>
<b>lf the customers approve, then</b>
<b>l will buy these, worth the sky.</b>
<b>Do you know how much l mean?</b>
<b>lt's 10,000,000.</b>
<b>So, your name is Ohampa Rani?</b>
<b>- People there serve her.</b>
<b>ls this a sample</b>
<b>My God!</b>
<b>Which one fell?</b>
<b>l am trapped.</b>
<b>l'm not at fault. That smart officer</b>
<b>of mine told me to come here.</b>
<b>l'm on duty. l won't lie.</b>
<b>A mere Policeman trying to</b>
<b>deceive lrtan!</b>
<b>Do not move!</b>
<b>A policeman too has dignity.</b>
<b>Hey fatso! Don't you have</b>
<b>a sister at home?</b>
<b>l am your sister...</b>
<b>l mean, your brother.</b>
<b>lrtan, you are like my son.</b>
<b>Will you kill your father?</b>
<b>Here comes your godfather!</b>
<b>lrtan, sit in the jeep</b>
<b>with your stooges.</b>
<b>See that? He comes to arrest me.</b>
<b>lnspector Amar Saxena has come.</b>
<b>Terrific!</b>
<b>l am sorry, you had to wait</b>
<b>for a while.</b>
<b>Did you give her tea?</b>
<b>- Around 5-6 cups.</b>
<b>She has been here since 6 hours.</b>
<b>- l'm sorry, you had to wait.</b>
<b>She is here for Mr.Amar.</b>
<b>- You should have said so.</b>
<b>Waiting for you.</b>
<b>She is Roma Singh, sub editor of</b>
<b>'Samadhan'. She's here to meet you.</b>
<b>l liked your style.</b>
<b>Pardon?</b>
<b>l liked seeing the tan uniform</b>
<b>on responsible shoulders for once.</b>
<b>What can l do for you?</b>
<b>A lot... if you have the intention.</b>
<b>l need Vishal Agnihotri's file.</b>
<b>The Oommissioner has sent me.</b>
<b>The girl is dialing the number</b>
<b>And sir is not answering the phone.</b>
<b>l don't let go even a wrong number!</b>
<b>Sir won't get involved with her.</b>
<b>He is very straight.</b>
<b>- Stand straight.</b>
<b>Will l get the file?</b>
<b>- Why?</b>
<b>What interest does that</b>
<b>case hold you?</b>
<b>l am studying it. l want to get</b>
<b>Vishal Agnihotri released.</b>
<b>Are journalists short of other work?</b>
<b>- What?</b>
<b>What will you get by looking</b>
<b>at a murderer's file?</b>
<b>l have got it.</b>
<b>Well, l met you.</b>
<b>All right, l will find it for you.</b>
<b>Here is Rs.100 thousand which they</b>
<b>had used. Oount them.</b>
<b>Oounting them will mean</b>
<b>doubting lrtan's honesty.</b>
<b>Sir, it involves these people</b>
<b>and money. l will count it.</b>
<b>l will count as l am free.</b>
<b>Any way, l am good at counting.</b>
<b>Shut up! What was the</b>
<b>need for this charade?</b>
<b>You should have been</b>
<b>working in a theater.</b>
<b>l intend to do just that</b>
<b>after retiring.</b>
<b>lf such acts continue, the public</b>
<b>will put a theater board outside!</b>
<b>Well said, sir!</b>
<b>Sometimes on the basis of suspicion,</b>
<b>the police do find some thing.</b>
<b>Do something about the inspector.</b>
<b>Don't worry about him.</b>
<b>He has just got his uniform.</b>
<b>A new bride constantly looks</b>
<b>at her nose ring in the mirror!</b>
<b>Well said, sir!</b>
<b>So, can l take them?</b>
<b>- By all means.</b>
<b>Shall l give the car?</b>
<b>- No.</b>
<b>l shall drop them.</b>
<b>...come on, Mr. lrtan.</b>
<b>You need not oblige.</b>
<b>Give my regards to your boss.</b>
<b>- Yes. l'll ask him to call you.</b>
<b>Bravo, Sir!</b>
<b>The hand that should arrest criminals</b>
<b>is shaking hands with them instead!</b>
<b>l am right, sir. The leniency of</b>
<b>the law abets such people's courage.</b>
<b>The one you are releasing... he</b>
<b>sells death!</b>
<b>Did you hear?</b>
<b>- All of you go.</b>
<b>Be calm, Amar.</b>
<b>Forget about the balls and convey</b>
<b>my regards to your boss.</b>
<b>Our business requires the</b>
<b>eyesight of a hawk.</b>
<b>Whose carelessness was</b>
<b>responsible for this?</b>
<b>How did the police reach here?</b>
<b>Who was at the gate?</b>
<b>l was. l overlooked</b>
<b>because it was a woman.</b>
<b>l am sorry, l couldn't see through her.</b>
<b>Forgive me, sir.</b>
<b>ln our business, one does not</b>
<b>get forgiveness for errors..</b>
<b>but death.</b>
<b>Yes, mother?</b>
<b>You have been awaited since 2 hours.</b>
<b>l went to conduct a raid.</b>
<b>l remember your father when</b>
<b>l see your dedication.</b>
<b>l've heard that you are talked about</b>
<b>a lot in the department.</b>
<b>You wanted this, right?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>Are you happy?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>But l do have a complaint.</b>
<b>- What?</b>
<b>You don't tell me everything</b>
<b>- What have l hidden?</b>
<b>About us.</b>
<b>- You!</b>
<b>l mean, what are you doing here?</b>
<b>- Don't act smart.</b>
<b>Roma has told me everything.</b>
<b>- What has she said?</b>
<b>l haven't told her everything.</b>
<b>- Mother, l met herjust today.</b>
<b>Liar!</b>
<b>- What?</b>
<b>His father too was a strict</b>
<b>police officer.</b>
<b>But he used to be</b>
<b>speechless with me.</b>
<b>Mother, it's not what you think it is.</b>
<b>Why are you scared? Roma is</b>
<b>as an educated and good girl.</b>
<b>The problem is, that she</b>
<b>is more educated than l am.</b>
<b>All right, l shall leave.</b>
<b>l came to thank you for</b>
<b>Vishal Agnihotri's file.</b>
<b>And to tell you, that l have</b>
<b>found the prime witness, Tony.</b>
<b>Due to Mr. Jindal's efforts, there</b>
<b>will be the police, the judiciary...</b>
<b>and the ministers as jury members</b>
<b>at the special conference today.</b>
<b>A decision will have to be made</b>
<b>today about Vishal's case.</b>
<b>lt's time to go.</b>
<b>Mr. Jindal has not yet come.</b>
<b>- He will come there directly.</b>
<b>But why hasn't Mr. Jindal who is</b>
<b>so punctual, not yet come?</b>
<b>He is a newspaper man. They add fuel</b>
<b>to the fire...</b>
<b>and come to watch the smoke later.</b>
<b>To add fuel to fire is the job</b>
<b>of the politicians and the police.</b>
<b>Keep me out of it.</b>
<b>Please come.</b>
<b>- Are you blind?</b>
<b>Are you blind?</b>
<b>- No.</b>
<b>Then why are you holding my hand?</b>
<b>l don't need help to find my seat.</b>
<b>Start the proceedings. Oall Tony.</b>
<b>Oome, Tony.</b>
<b>Tell them, whether those boys</b>
<b>had raped Rita or not.</b>
<b>lt is true, sir. Those four boys</b>
<b>drugged her at the party...</b>
<b>And they raped her.</b>
<b>They had deceptively given me too</b>
<b>an overdose of drugs.</b>
<b>l was helpless, sir. l could not do</b>
<b>a thing to rescue her.</b>
<b>Then why didn't you testify so?</b>
<b>They had threatened to kill me.</b>
<b>l was scared, sir.</b>
<b>Therefore, l kept mum in the</b>
<b>count. l was scared, sir.</b>
<b>Enough, Tony.</b>
<b>Wait outside.</b>
<b>What proof do you have that</b>
<b>Tony speaks the truth now?</b>
<b>How can you value the words of one</b>
<b>who is not in his senses?</b>
<b>l have the answer to your question.</b>
<b>Here is the Public Prosecutor,</b>
<b>Mr Khanna's statement...</b>
<b>and his criminal record.</b>
<b>Mr Khanna was the Defendant</b>
<b>of those four rapists.</b>
<b>He had turned the case by</b>
<b>accepting a bribe.</b>
<b>Mr Khanna is in jail since one year.</b>
<b>There are many such charges</b>
<b>against him.</b>
<b>You will read in this, how</b>
<b>the protectors of the law...</b>
<b>had named a price and</b>
<b>acquitted the criminals.</b>
<b>There was no justice</b>
<b>given in the court.</b>
<b>The rape of that girl</b>
<b>was being mocked at.</b>
<b>Oommissioner, do read it,...the</b>
<b>testimony of a pimp of the law.</b>
<b>Why do you always make the sword of</b>
<b>Damocles hang over my head?</b>
<b>Release Vishal if you wish.</b>
<b>We are handling 36,000 criminals</b>
<b>in the city.</b>
<b>One more won't make a difference.</b>
<b>We will admit one more sepoy!</b>
<b>You are wrong. Vishal is not</b>
<b>a professional criminal.</b>
<b>He too will live a new life as</b>
<b>a layman does.</b>
<b>But who will guarantee that he will</b>
<b>live like a dignified man?</b>
<b>A man's biggest guarantee</b>
<b>is his conscience.</b>
<b>When a policeman is given his uniform</b>
<b>who guarantees his honesty?</b>
<b>One sacrifices his life for duty,</b>
<b>the other becomes a pimp of the law.</b>
<b>Are you accusing me?</b>
<b>- No.</b>
<b>You are one of those</b>
<b>martyrs, aren't you?</b>
<b>The testimony of the</b>
<b>Public Prosecutor proves...</b>
<b>that Tony is speaking the truth.</b>
<b>Mr Khanna has put the law to</b>
<b>shame with his crime.</b>
<b>lt has been proved, that the 4 boys</b>
<b>were guilty and criminals.</b>
<b>Due to lack of substantial evidences,</b>
<b>the court had to acquit them.</b>
<b>But this matter is different from</b>
<b>the one involving Vishal's case.</b>
<b>lt is not a different matter,</b>
<b>Honorable Judge!</b>
<b>The cause for Vishal's crime stems</b>
<b>Vishal's helplessness to kill rose</b>
<b>lf his sentence</b>
<b>is life imprisonment...</b>
<b>then every person involved with</b>
<b>this case should be punished..</b>
<b>because they have murdered</b>
<b>justice!</b>
<b>l agree with Mr. Jindal.</b>
<b>l think Vishal should be given a</b>
<b>chance to live like a normal citizen.</b>
<b>Vishal should be released</b>
<b>- He's not been justified.</b>
<b>After considering the case presented</b>
<b>by Mr Jindal and Mr. Roma,...</b>
<b>l reach a verdict, that the</b>
<b>circumstances which compelled...</b>
<b>Vishal to kill, was created by the</b>
<b>loopholes of the law.</b>
<b>lt's essential that we see this case</b>
<b>And as you wish, l will send my</b>
<b>report to the Law Ministry.</b>
<b>l am sure, the orders for Vishal's</b>
<b>release will come soon.</b>
<b>Anything special in the papers?</b>
<b>Roma, when did you come?</b>
<b>You are so lost, that you were not</b>
<b>even aware, l had come.</b>
<b>l am reading about you.</b>
<b>Every paper carries</b>
<b>Mr Jindal and your name.</b>
<b>You had a murderer released!</b>
<b>Very good! Oongratulations!</b>
<b>You aren't congratulating me</b>
<b>Really?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>How can you speak so confidently</b>
<b>about how l feel?</b>
<b>l am your friend.</b>
<b>Eyes are the mirror of one's feelings.</b>
<b>One only requires</b>
<b>the vision to read it.</b>
<b>Read anything?</b>
<b>lt will be better if l fulfill</b>
<b>my duty as a policeman.</b>
<b>All right, l will assign a</b>
<b>policeman's duty to you.</b>
<b>A girl is going to commit suicide...</b>
<b>by jumping from the fourth floor</b>
<b>of a building under construction.</b>
<b>lf you reach at dot 8 tonight,</b>
<b>then, maybe, her life will be saved</b>
<b>''Raindrops fall''</b>
<b>''Raindrops fall''</b>
<b>''Raindrops started a fire''</b>
<b>''When my heart was set on fire</b>
<b>it was you, l thought of you''</b>
<b>''When l thought of you</b>
<b>my wet body was set aflame''</b>
<b>''Now you tell me, my love</b>
<b>what am l to do?</b>
<b>''You name</b>
<b>l had on my lips''</b>
<b>''An excuse l had made</b>
<b>to bring you here''</b>
<b>''Showers came pouring down</b>
<b>What am l to do?''</b>
<b>''Standing on the shore</b>
<b>l got drowned in the sea''</b>
<b>''Like a lightning</b>
<b>you struck my heart''</b>
<b>''The wind blows so crazily</b>
<b>What am l to do?</b>
<b>''Raindrops fall''</b>
<b>''Raindrops started a fire''</b>
<b>''When my heart was set on fire</b>
<b>it was you, l thought of you''</b>
<b>''When l thought of you</b>
<b>insanity engulfed me''</b>
<b>''My senses are beyond my control</b>
<b>what am l to do?</b>
<b>Your release is an unprecedented</b>
<b>decision for the law, Vishal.</b>
<b>l am confident, that you will live</b>
<b>a life like a normal citizen.</b>
<b>Sir, Roma freed me from here.</b>
<b>But where will l search for my life</b>
<b>in the outside world?</b>
<b>You may go.</b>
<b>- Yes, sir.</b>
<b>Your release is the talk of</b>
<b>the town today.</b>
<b>lt was talked about even</b>
<b>in the Assembly yesterday.</b>
<b>Anyway, l am immensely happy to</b>
<b>see you in front of me today.</b>
<b>l mean, by feeling your presence.</b>
<b>Oongratulations on your release.</b>
<b>l fail to understand, that why</b>
<b>all of you did this for me.</b>
<b>l am not related to you,</b>
<b>nor do you know me.</b>
<b>No, you shouldn't think that way.</b>
<b>We share a special relationship.</b>
<b>lt was born, the day Roma presented</b>
<b>your case before me...</b>
<b>A 24 year old man who is engrossed</b>
<b>in dreaming life's colortul dreams...</b>
<b>His wife, her sister, his home...</b>
<b>are suddenly separated from him.</b>
<b>And he is imprisoned for the murder</b>
<b>of four people.</b>
<b>l too have been inflicted</b>
<b>with the same wound, Vishal.</b>
<b>The wound suddenly became raw after</b>
<b>hearing about you.</b>
<b>l too have lost a</b>
<b>wife, dearer than life to me.</b>
<b>l lost my eyes too.</b>
<b>Pooja was a very noble lady.</b>
<b>A social worker who fought</b>
<b>against drugs.</b>
<b>The hoodlums did not spare her...</b>
<b>ln front of my eyes...</b>
<b>she breathed her last on my lap.</b>
<b>Why did this happen?</b>
<b>A smiling Pooja got imprisoned</b>
<b>within a frame hung on the wall?</b>
<b>But those people are yet alive!</b>
<b>The business of selling drugs</b>
<b>is flourishing.</b>
<b>Nobody has the guts to raise</b>
<b>their voice against them.</b>
<b>Neither the police, nor the law,</b>
<b>nor the politicians.</b>
<b>Everybody is just watching the</b>
<b>damnation taking place.</b>
<b>How long will this continue, Vishal?</b>
<b>Won't a hand somewhere, raise to</b>
<b>hold the torch of a revolution?</b>
<b>l want to give this</b>
<b>torch to you.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>- Yes, Vishal.</b>
<b>You will to have to take this</b>
<b>torch in your hand.</b>
<b>Because my heart says</b>
<b>that this is the hand.</b>
<b>But, Mr. Jindal,....</b>
<b>- Do not misunderstand me.</b>
<b>You must understand that...</b>
<b>what l want you to do is not about</b>
<b>seeking revenge for my wife's death.</b>
<b>But l cannot murder anyone now.</b>
<b>l was compelled to do</b>
<b>whatever l had done.</b>
<b>You murdered those four boys.</b>
<b>But where did you punish the ones,</b>
<b>more guilty than those boys?</b>
<b>The boys committed a heinous</b>
<b>crime in a drugged state.</b>
<b>But who was responsible for</b>
<b>them getting drugged?</b>
<b>They are the real culprits.</b>
<b>As long as these devils are alive,</b>
<b>this game will go on in this city.</b>
<b>l have seen this city and its</b>
<b>citizens from close quarters.</b>
<b>You have done me</b>
<b>a favor, Mr. Jindal.</b>
<b>But l cannot repay you by</b>
<b>doing what you are asking me to.</b>
<b>lt is not my fault but yours.</b>
<b>You should have decided before.</b>
<b>''Make her understand,</b>
<b>brother-in-law''</b>
<b>''Be quiet.</b>
<b>l think, this decent man will be</b>
<b>killed, torn between 2 women.</b>
<b>''Support your sister-in-law.</b>
<b>You will regret it some day''</b>
<b>Rita's death was due to drugs.</b>
<b>lt was those 4 boys.</b>
<b>Punish them.</b>
<b>''You killed those four boys''</b>
<b>''But where did you punish the ones,</b>
<b>more guilty than those boys?''</b>
<b>''The business of selling drugs</b>
<b>is flourishing ''</b>
<b>''Nobody has the guts</b>
<b>to raise their voice against them.''</b>
<b>''As long as those devils are alive,</b>
<b>this game will go on.''</b>
<b>''Won't a hand somewhere, raise to</b>
<b>hold the torch of a revolution?''</b>
<b>This is the hand.</b>
<b>Jibran and Tyson...</b>
<b>They are the root cause of the crime</b>
<b>taking place in the city.</b>
<b>They deal in drugs.</b>
<b>They used to work together but</b>
<b>there is friction between them now.</b>
<b>You will have to find your success</b>
<b>by taking advantage of this friction.</b>
<b>You will have to wipe them and their</b>
<b>business from the face of the earth.</b>
<b>You will find their photographs and</b>
<b>information about them in this file.</b>
<b>l do not find it essential to guide</b>
<b>you about how to get the job done.</b>
<b>lf you need anything</b>
<b>for this mission...</b>
<b>like money, ammunitions, then</b>
<b>you will get it all from Desai.</b>
<b>Vishal, henceforth, we will</b>
<b>not meet here.</b>
<b>Desai will tell you about</b>
<b>our new rendezvous.</b>
<b>Do not worry. l will certainly</b>
<b>accomplish this mission.</b>
<b>l am sure, you will.</b>
<b>May God help you.</b>
<b>And yes, Vishal!</b>
<b>The most important thing.</b>
<b>You will not find a photograph on</b>
<b>the last page of the file.</b>
<b>He is the one you will</b>
<b>have to kill last.</b>
<b>He knows everything but</b>
<b>is pretending to be ignorant.</b>
<b>He has given refuge to criminals</b>
<b>like Jibran and Tyson.</b>
<b>Orime is flourishing under him.</b>
<b>Sitting in the highest position</b>
<b>of the Police force...</b>
<b>he is infesting</b>
<b>the society with crime.</b>
<b>He is the Police Oommissioner,</b>
<b>Kamdev Kulkarni.</b>
<b>The police is not doing anything</b>
<b>to control the drug problem?</b>
<b>What do you mean by it?</b>
<b>These bloody youngsters find their</b>
<b>life in drugs.</b>
<b>What can the police do</b>
<b>about that?</b>
<b>lf the goat goes to the butcher</b>
<b>on its own, then who can save it?</b>
<b>Well said, Sir!</b>
<b>Sir, we want to shrug off our</b>
<b>responsibility by thinking so.</b>
<b>The poison flowing in the blood of</b>
<b>the youngsters...</b>
<b>could be disastrous for</b>
<b>our country's future.</b>
<b>Such a speech sounds good only on</b>
<b>a politician speaking on the dais.</b>
<b>Why should we be concerned about</b>
<b>the country's future?</b>
<b>l spent half my life reaching</b>
<b>this position.</b>
<b>And if l spend the remaining half</b>
<b>by being concerned...</b>
<b>about remand, warrant,</b>
<b>then l will be left with nothing.</b>
<b>You are absolutely correct, Sir.</b>
<b>My father used to sell oil.</b>
<b>He sold oil and made me literate,</b>
<b>as well as got me a certificate.</b>
<b>Yet, l could not get a job. l offered</b>
<b>a bribe and got employed here.</b>
<b>l have made a plan which will have</b>
<b>every drug peddler behind bars.</b>
<b>But that has always been</b>
<b>your endeavor.</b>
<b>This time, there will be an operation</b>
<b>which l want to do secretly.</b>
<b>l will have to put on a charade</b>
<b>to remove the mask from some faces.</b>
<b>Happy birthday, Mr. Jibran.</b>
<b>- Thank you very much, Mr. Patel.</b>
<b>Welcome, Tyson!</b>
<b>Didn't l surprise you by coming here?</b>
<b>This heart was compelling me to wish</b>
<b>a friend, since morning.</b>
<b>But my head was saying otherwise.</b>
<b>What to do?... dirty mind!</b>
<b>By coming for such an auspicious</b>
<b>day, you have proved...</b>
<b>that there is still</b>
<b>friendship apparent in our enmity.</b>
<b>Look, what l have got for you.</b>
<b>Oall the bomb squad.</b>
<b>Maybe, Tyson is presenting me with</b>
<b>death instead of a gift.</b>
<b>For killing a thick skinned man like</b>
<b>you, one doesn't need a bomb...</b>
<b>but a sex bomb!</b>
<b>Our big brother is generous. He</b>
<b>always shares everything.</b>
<b>So, will you open the gift here</b>
<b>or alone in the room?</b>
<b>Enough of Tyson's fooling.</b>
<b>Let's get down to business</b>
<b>inside... come on.</b>
<b>We are old friends, we used</b>
<b>to do business together in our youth.</b>
<b>We had no roots of enmity.</b>
<b>But your manipulative nature has</b>
<b>certainly created a distance.</b>
<b>You started it first, Jibran.</b>
<b>By taking away my goods</b>
<b>worth millions.</b>
<b>You too took my goods</b>
<b>worth 20 million at Mauritius.</b>
<b>lf you act smart with me,</b>
<b>this will happen.</b>
<b>This animosity can end if we</b>
<b>distribute our area.</b>
<b>You are right, or we will keep</b>
<b>fighting like dogs..</b>
<b>and it will work to the</b>
<b>advantage of a third person.</b>
<b>This dirty mind had given the</b>
<b>solution before.</b>
<b>All right. l accept your solution.</b>
<b>The west is yours.</b>
<b>l'll take care of the East.</b>
<b>Where will my place be, darling?</b>
<b>Flora darling, a girl's place is</b>
<b>in a man's heart.</b>
<b>Enjoy the party</b>
<b>l'll be there soon.</b>
<b>l am Jibran speaking.</b>
<b>Send your man.</b>
<b>The deal will take place there.</b>
<b>My business is entirely handled</b>
<b>by my nephew, lrtan.</b>
<b>Next Saturday night at nine</b>
<b>in Queen's night club.</b>
<b>Jibran is going to make</b>
<b>a big deal.</b>
<b>lf we can catch him red handed,...</b>
<b>then, at least one chapter in</b>
<b>the world of crime will be closed.</b>
<b>But the problem is, how to</b>
<b>enter his private night club.</b>
<b>No! Do not look at me that way!</b>
<b>You will send me as a</b>
<b>guinea pig there.</b>
<b>And when l'm near the jaws of</b>
<b>death, you'll make a heroic entry!</b>
<b>Due to your heroism, someday,</b>
<b>l will be killed. No way!</b>
<b>l have made a wondertul plan to</b>
<b>enter the club.</b>
<b>Oongrats, sir! She has made a plan</b>
<b>to have us killed!</b>
<b>You always think negatively.</b>
<b>He too will join us.</b>
<b>Meaning?</b>
<b>- You won't understand, Kashi.</b>
<b>''You are a wondertul babe!''</b>
<b>''You are a wondertul babe''</b>
<b>''You are devoid of your senses''</b>
<b>''You are devoid of your senses</b>
<b>for you have the zeal of youth''</b>
<b>''lt is no fault of yours''</b>
<b>''For you are intoxicated every moment''</b>
<b>''Lover is your name''</b>
<b>''Lover is your name''</b>
<b>''To steal and give a heart</b>
<b>is yourjob''</b>
<b>''Do not hold my arms</b>
<b>For you are a man, so maligned''</b>
<b>''Tell me, O love''</b>
<b>''What is so special about me?''</b>
<b>''You are a thread</b>
<b>made of silk''</b>
<b>''You are a thread</b>
<b>made of silk''</b>
<b>''Lovers strut behind you</b>
<b>when you walk''</b>
<b>''Your thick tresses, sweetheart,</b>
<b>are like the dark clouds above''</b>
<b>''This heart of mine</b>
<b>is drowned in the depth of your eyes''</b>
<b>''Become my loved one''</b>
<b>''Do not pierce me with, your eyes''</b>
<b>''Do not pierce me with your eyes</b>
<b>for it will hurt me all over''</b>
<b>''Do not think, it is easy, my dear</b>
<b>This love is very tough''</b>
<b>Do not move, or l shall shoot you!</b>
<b>He is dead, boss.</b>
<b>He has had a heart failure.</b>
<b>What are you doing here?</b>
<b>What does a man do in the bus?</b>
<b>lt is not my habit to</b>
<b>do anything illegal.</b>
<b>l have a ticket.</b>
<b>Anyway, my stop is here.</b>
<b>l am telling you, brother, that</b>
<b>this is lnspector Amar's doing.</b>
<b>He has killed my son!</b>
<b>- Do not worry.</b>
<b>lrtan's Killer will</b>
<b>soon be unveiled.</b>
<b>l found a very useful pawn from</b>
<b>the police force.</b>
<b>Salutations, Sir!</b>
<b>l am very thrilled that you</b>
<b>remembered me.</b>
<b>l did not feel so happy</b>
<b>even l got a job in the police force.</b>
<b>l've taken a great risk by coming</b>
<b>to you... l'm a policeman after all.</b>
<b>Tell me the truth about lrtan's death</b>
<b>and l shall make you more happy.</b>
<b>l am not greedy.</b>
<b>To surtace the truth is a policeman's</b>
<b>duty. l won't lie to you.</b>
<b>l shall tell you about lrtan's death</b>
<b>exactly as l saw it.</b>
<b>Sir, don't mind, but l'll charge</b>
<b>Rs.100 per second for this case.</b>
<b>Okay?.. Hey Shortie, is your</b>
<b>watch working?</b>
<b>Give me the watch... is it stolen?</b>
<b>How can your man steal?</b>
<b>lt was the atmosphere of a</b>
<b>night club at eleven O'clock.</b>
<b>People were dancing.</b>
<b>l saw it too. What happened</b>
<b>after the lights went off?</b>
<b>Oh yes! You had seen it.</b>
<b>l wanted to make money.</b>
<b>lrtan ran outside</b>
<b>after seeing the corpse.</b>
<b>By the time, we reached lrtan,</b>
<b>he had reached above!</b>
<b>We only found lrtan's Oorpse.</b>
<b>lf we had found his killer, wouldn't</b>
<b>we have shot him?.. lt is 40 seconds.</b>
<b>Only Rs.4000</b>
<b>Give him 10,000.</b>
<b>- 10,000!</b>
<b>He has to help us a lot</b>
<b>in the future.</b>
<b>So lnspector Amar didn't kill lrtan?</b>
<b>- No.</b>
<b>Then, who can kill my son?</b>
<b>There is only one man in the city,</b>
<b>who would dare to attack me!</b>
<b>''Tyson, the biggest drug dealer</b>
<b>in the city.''</b>
<b>''His younger brother, Jackson''.</b>
<b>''Flora, Tyson's mistress.''</b>
<b>''And this is Marcos,</b>
<b>Tyson's right hand.</b>
<b>''He does all the killings in the</b>
<b>city. He is very dangerous''.</b>
<b>Oome and make your stars shine</b>
<b>for Rs.2</b>
<b>Sir, the shoes are worn out.</b>
<b>- What?</b>
<b>My shoes are worn out,</b>
<b>pursuing Marcos.</b>
<b>He runs from one hotel to another</b>
<b>to escape the police.</b>
<b>He has come.</b>
<b>Marcos is the most loyal and</b>
<b>special man of Tyson.</b>
<b>lf we catch Marcos with the goods,</b>
<b>then apprehending Tyson will be easy.</b>
<b>What happened?</b>
<b>l'll be back soon.</b>
<b>- Hurry up!</b>
<b>Why is he going back?</b>
<b>- He must've got a call from above!</b>
<b>Who are you?</b>
<b>- Death!</b>
<b>Short cut!</b>
<b>Wait, Vishal.</b>
<b>There is a corpse out and l am</b>
<b>looking out for the murderer.</b>
<b>l can't help you.</b>
<b>What are you doing here?</b>
<b>Why? ls there a curtew imposed here?</b>
<b>That's not an answer.</b>
<b>l had some important work.</b>
<b>- What was it?</b>
<b>lt is a personal matter</b>
<b>- What is that personal matter?</b>
<b>Leave my way!</b>
<b>You are unnecessarily harassing me.</b>
<b>You'll always find me confronting you</b>
<b>on the path that you tread.</b>
<b>My profession is to harass criminals</b>
<b>to speak the truth!</b>
<b>You are unnecessarily getting</b>
<b>involved with me, lnspector!</b>
<b>Who is getting entangled with you?</b>
<b>He says, that l have just</b>
<b>killed somebody.</b>
<b>Vishal was with me since the</b>
<b>last two hours.</b>
<b>Mr Jindal, he has kept you also</b>
<b>in the dark.</b>
<b>Who will keep a blind</b>
<b>in darkness?</b>
<b>Your suspicion on Vishal is baseless.</b>
<b>He is a very decent man.</b>
<b>He cannot bear decency, Mr Jindal.</b>
<b>A criminal is not born from</b>
<b>a mother's womb.</b>
<b>Your law and your police force</b>
<b>give birth to him!</b>
<b>l am that pawn of the police,</b>
<b>whom you cannot checkmate!</b>
<b>Remember, the dark dungeon</b>
<b>in the prison awaits you!</b>
<b>The goods must safely reach the</b>
<b>boat by midnight.</b>
<b>Be careful. There are police</b>
<b>check posts at night.</b>
<b>Yes, sir.</b>
<b>Your time has come, Jibran!</b>
<b>You kill our man!</b>
<b>What is all this?</b>
<b>Why are you here?</b>
<b>l am here to settle</b>
<b>scores for Marcos' death.</b>
<b>Do not blow on flames</b>
<b>that are deep down, Jackson!</b>
<b>Or l will have to destroy</b>
<b>an old friendship!</b>
<b>You display a facade of friendship</b>
<b>and attack us behind our backs!</b>
<b>lllusion has made your mind hollow!</b>
<b>We have to dig their graves, here,</b>
<b>brother... kill them!</b>
<b>Stop!</b>
<b>l think, you have come to commit</b>
<b>suicide today, Tyson.</b>
<b>l am leaving you alive!</b>
<b>lf you deceive us again...</b>
<b>then l will not speak.</b>
<b>My AK-47 will speak!</b>
<b>Brother, why did you</b>
<b>let them go alive?</b>
<b>lt is wise to control</b>
<b>your anger now.</b>
<b>lf Tyson dares to confront me</b>
<b>the next time...</b>
<b>then l shall send his men</b>
<b>and him to hell!</b>
<b>By adding fuel to the fire of</b>
<b>enmity between Jibran and Tyson...</b>
<b>you have found a very nice</b>
<b>plan to kill both of them.</b>
<b>They will keep fighting and you</b>
<b>can easily target them.</b>
<b>But beware of the Police, Vishal,</b>
<b>especially of lnspector Amar Saxena.</b>
<b>He suspects you.</b>
<b>You're needlessly pursuing</b>
<b>an innocent man.</b>
<b>You've even forgotten me!</b>
<b>Do you know, what is today?</b>
<b>- What?</b>
<b>You really do not know?</b>
<b>- No.</b>
<b>What's today?</b>
<b>Whom are you waiting for?</b>
<b>All your office people are here.</b>
<b>l think, you should cut the cake.</b>
<b>How can the program proceed</b>
<b>without doing so?</b>
<b>What's the matter? Are you scared</b>
<b>on becoming 21?</b>
<b>l am longing to hear the sound</b>
<b>of applause.</b>
<b>l think, you are waiting for</b>
<b>a special guest.</b>
<b>Don't make us wait any longer.</b>
<b>We are hungry! Am l right?</b>
<b>What aroma! Do not starve the hungry</b>
<b>any longer. We are hungry.</b>
<b>Oome on, Roma.</b>
<b>l know, you won't cut the cake</b>
<b>before getting your present.</b>
<b>Happy birthday.</b>
<b>Greetings, Mr Jindal.</b>
<b>- Greetings!</b>
<b>Enough of flowers and bouquets!</b>
<b>Now, you'll have to make her happy</b>
<b>with a special gift.. am l right?</b>
<b>Oertainly.</b>
<b>Friends, my daughter</b>
<b>has chosen her life partner.</b>
<b>And he is Amar Saxena.</b>
<b>Double celebrations!</b>
<b>l don't understand one thing.</b>
<b>- What?</b>
<b>The press and the police are two</b>
<b>bitter enemies.</b>
<b>The, how did they end in marriage?</b>
<b>Hearty congratulations!</b>
<b>Exchange your rings.</b>
<b>Let's complete the tradition of</b>
<b>an engagement.</b>
<b>''From morning till evening</b>
<b>''From night till morning</b>
<b>''Love me''</b>
<b>''From the city till the village</b>
<b>''From head to toe</b>
<b>Till the care of my heart''</b>
<b>''Love me''</b>
<b>''Do anything my love</b>
<b>But remember''</b>
<b>''Some things to be done</b>
<b>before marriage some, after''</b>
<b>''Why keep so many conditions</b>
<b>in love, O darling?''</b>
<b>''To do some things before marriage</b>
<b>some, after''</b>
<b>''From near to far</b>
<b>''Till the thirst of these lips</b>
<b>''Love me''</b>
<b>''How can love be complete like this?''</b>
<b>''Either openly accept</b>
<b>or openly refuse''</b>
<b>''Put your arms around my neck</b>
<b>and speak a few words.</b>
<b>''Beyond that you will have to wait''.</b>
<b>''From this end of the ocean</b>
<b>to that end of the ocean''</b>
<b>''From love to love''</b>
<b>''Love me''</b>
<b>l am Flora speaking...</b>
<b>Just a minute.</b>
<b>He too is coming?</b>
<b>Our meeting is confirmed.</b>
<b>Be cautious, Kashi.</b>
<b>There couldn't be a better chance</b>
<b>to catch Tyson red-handed.</b>
<b>There should be no slip, okay?</b>
<b>- There won't be, from my side.</b>
<b>l went to the airport</b>
<b>and found out that...</b>
<b>the Ohinese and the black</b>
<b>guy were not on the flight.</b>
<b>They must have changed their</b>
<b>program out of fear.</b>
<b>''After Marcos, Minto is Tyson's</b>
<b>most loyal man''.</b>
<b>''He supplies drugs outside all the</b>
<b>schools and colleges in the city''</b>
<b>He is Tyson's younger</b>
<b>brother, Mr. Jackson.</b>
<b>Where are the goods?</b>
<b>- Here.</b>
<b>Show me the brown sugar first..</b>
<b>You can see this afterwards.</b>
<b>Don't worry about the goods.</b>
<b>They are of the best quality.</b>
<b>We want brown sugar.</b>
<b>We will give you genuine goods.</b>
<b>lt is very genuine.</b>
<b>Sniffing it makes me sweaty.</b>
<b>lt seems very hot!</b>
<b>A masquerade?</b>
<b>Sir, why is he looking at</b>
<b>me this way?</b>
<b>The black paint on your face is wiped</b>
<b>out. You've trapped me again!</b>
<b>What nonsense!</b>
<b>lt is Asian Paint!</b>
<b>What about your beard,</b>
<b>you Ohinese?</b>
<b>Tell him that lndians and Ohinese</b>
<b>are brothers, or he'll bash us up.</b>
<b>He won't. lt's our turn.</b>
<b>Who are you?</b>
<b>Sub-lnspector Xandela alias</b>
<b>Kashinath Sahu.</b>
<b>Olose all the doors.</b>
<b>Do not leave them alive!</b>
<b>They have asked for their death</b>
<b>by coming here.</b>
<b>Thank you. You're an angel!</b>
<b>An angel of death.</b>
<b>Damn!</b>
<b>He's dead!</b>
<b>Fortunate guy.</b>
<b>His bier is on four wheels...</b>
<b>and his funeral rites</b>
<b>are over too!</b>
<b>You mean, the police</b>
<b>is doing its duty...</b>
<b>by raiding my warehouse and</b>
<b>killing my people unreasonably?</b>
<b>Amar did raid your warehouse but</b>
<b>he did not kill anybody.</b>
<b>We too are wondering who's pertorming</b>
<b>our duty despite not being a cop.</b>
<b>This game is being played</b>
<b>by someone else and not Tyson.</b>
<b>He is using both of you. By the way,</b>
<b>l know this man very well.</b>
<b>Who is he?</b>
<b>- l will tell you.</b>
<b>lf l had informed the police about</b>
<b>this, l would have got an award.</b>
<b>But l want your reward.</b>
<b>l must charge</b>
<b>Rs.1000 per second.</b>
<b>Peak-hour call charges are higher.</b>
<b>l will charge Rs.500 from you</b>
<b>and the remaining 500 from Tyson.</b>
<b>Minto ran. Our smart inspector</b>
<b>pursued him and l followed him.</b>
<b>Minto got into a moving car.</b>
<b>He thought, he had escaped the cops.</b>
<b>The car driver attacked him swiftly</b>
<b>and took him to the jaws of death...</b>
<b>The car fell 50 feet below. Our great</b>
<b>man jumped out; Minto died.</b>
<b>But... l know that great man.</b>
<b>Tell me his name.</b>
<b>Yes. Neither is he a policeman,</b>
<b>nor is he Tyson's man.</b>
<b>You are shocked, aren't you?</b>
<b>Even l was.</b>
<b>We had seen Vishal in the vicinity</b>
<b>during lrtan and Marcos' murder.</b>
<b>lt is 50 seconds up... only Rs.25,000</b>
<b>You'll get it.</b>
<b>Go to the factory</b>
<b>and alert everybody.</b>
<b>Bhinda Thakur, the Supervisor of</b>
<b>Jibran's drug factory.</b>
<b>''Jibran has opened</b>
<b>this textile mill...</b>
<b>solely to put a facade</b>
<b>over his illegal businesses''.</b>
<b>''Actually there is a</b>
<b>drug factory here.''</b>
<b>''Raw materials of the drugs are</b>
<b>brought here every night''.</b>
<b>''They are made more poisonous</b>
<b>and sold in the entire city''.</b>
<b>''lf this factory will be destroyed,</b>
<b>then Jibran will be ruined.''</b>
<b>Hey, where are you going?</b>
<b>Who are you?</b>
<b>But the supply is on.</b>
<b>- lt won't be any more.</b>
<b>We are the victims of a great</b>
<b>misunderstanding.</b>
<b>We are blaming each other</b>
<b>for the loss of our goods.</b>
<b>ln fact, a third person</b>
<b>is using our enmity...</b>
<b>to create a misunderstanding</b>
<b>between us.</b>
<b>But why does he want to ruin us?</b>
<b>- That's what l'm worried about.</b>
<b>We have to talk. Oome to my</b>
<b>house tomorrow.</b>
<b>At your house?</b>
<b>No. We will meet at a place which is</b>
<b>neither my territory nor yours.</b>
<b>We will meet at Boribunder quarry</b>
<b>at 9 a.m. tomorrow.</b>
<b>Yes, dirty mind?</b>
<b>- lt's a delicate situation.</b>
<b>We have to forget</b>
<b>our hostility and unite.</b>
<b>ls this a new calculative</b>
<b>move on your behalf?</b>
<b>Believe me, what l say is true.</b>
<b>Death lurks round the corner for us.</b>
<b>Vishal Agnihotri has to be...</b>
<b>Deception!</b>
<b>Kill the bastards!</b>
<b>Not one should survive!</b>
<b>Kill them!</b>
<b>Who are you? Why are you</b>
<b>seeking vengeance from me?</b>
<b>Well done, Vishal! l knew,</b>
<b>you would do this.</b>
<b>Oongratulations.</b>
<b>Your mission is nearly accomplished.</b>
<b>lt won't be difficult for</b>
<b>Vishal to kill the Oommissioner now.</b>
<b>Yes. Today is a very special</b>
<b>day for me.</b>
<b>My aim to clear the city is</b>
<b>being fulfilled.</b>
<b>There is a lot of bloodshed</b>
<b>in the city.</b>
<b>One more peg.</b>
<b>Sir, you are drinking a lot today.</b>
<b>When l am happy, l drink</b>
<b>alcohol like water.</b>
<b>l am happy today, that</b>
<b>there is someone.</b>
<b>There is someone who is doing</b>
<b>the work of our department.</b>
<b>He is cleaning the filth!</b>
<b>And this... what do you say...</b>
<b>well wisher of the society...</b>
<b>does not get entangled with the</b>
<b>rules of our department or the court.</b>
<b>He straight away shoots!</b>
<b>The struggle is over!</b>
<b>l feel, that our department, instead</b>
<b>of increasing the police stations,...</b>
<b>should deploy 4-5 such</b>
<b>well-wishers of society.</b>
<b>All the cases will be solved</b>
<b>in no time.</b>
<b>Well said, sir!</b>
<b>Welcome, Vishal!</b>
<b>l feel like embracing you today.</b>
<b>You have done the society a great</b>
<b>favor by killing the Oommissioner.</b>
<b>You have eradicated evil.</b>
<b>Evil was always destroyed on the</b>
<b>foundation of truth.</b>
<b>And truth is not</b>
<b>what you have told me.</b>
<b>Therefore, l left the Oommissioner alive.</b>
<b>- What!</b>
<b>You did that in spite</b>
<b>of knowing everything?</b>
<b>l always believe in what l</b>
<b>hear and what l see.</b>
<b>l know the truth</b>
<b>about the Oommissioner.</b>
<b>He is a man defeated by the</b>
<b>system... decent and honest.</b>
<b>He is not a friend but a foe of</b>
<b>criminals like Tyson and Jibran.</b>
<b>Yet, you portrayed a false picture</b>
<b>before me. Why, Mr. Jindal? Tell me!</b>
<b>The Oommissioner is an impostor.</b>
<b>You are making a grave error by</b>
<b>believing in his charade.</b>
<b>Maybe, you are putting on a</b>
<b>charade before me.</b>
<b>l am making a grave error by blindly</b>
<b>believing your story.</b>
<b>A blind man cannot save his life</b>
<b>so swiftly, Mr. Jindal.</b>
<b>So, you are not blind?</b>
<b>You can see everything.</b>
<b>Yes, very well.</b>
<b>And you were making me dance like</b>
<b>a puppet all the while?</b>
<b>You have reached the correct</b>
<b>conclusion, Vishal.</b>
<b>By blindly believing in me, you have</b>
<b>indeed been deceived.</b>
<b>But l was not wrong</b>
<b>in choosing you.</b>
<b>Because l needed a weapon to</b>
<b>finish my enemies, Jibran and Tyson.</b>
<b>The day Roma told me about you...</b>
<b>l decided to make you my pawn.</b>
<b>The problem is that...</b>
<b>l want to be the world's</b>
<b>wealthiest and the most powertul man.</b>
<b>Oheat! l will put an end to</b>
<b>your deception.</b>
<b>Tie him.</b>
<b>Order me and l will</b>
<b>send him to hell!</b>
<b>His time is over but l still am a</b>
<b>little indebted to him.</b>
<b>He has served me lot.</b>
<b>So l will have to answer the</b>
<b>queries in his mind.</b>
<b>Or his soul will not be at peace.</b>
<b>To reach this juncture, l have</b>
<b>endured great difficulties.</b>
<b>Wonder how many risks l have taken.</b>
<b>l had an obsession to acquire</b>
<b>a lot of wealth, from before.</b>
<b>Stop your illegal businesses if</b>
<b>you want to become rich.</b>
<b>Become self-respectful</b>
<b>and hardworking.</b>
<b>How long will you depend on</b>
<b>your friend?</b>
<b>Why don't you work at my father's</b>
<b>printing press office?</b>
<b>l want all the materialistic comforts</b>
<b>l want a lot of money.</b>
<b>lf you want to become rich overnight,</b>
<b>stop smuggling watches and clothes.</b>
<b>You have to move with the times.</b>
<b>And time demands drugs.</b>
<b>Therefore, my dirty mind</b>
<b>has planned a scheme.</b>
<b>You can become rich overnight but</b>
<b>there is a lot of risks involved.</b>
<b>l am ready to face</b>
<b>the greatest risks.</b>
<b>Your friend, lnspector Karan,</b>
<b>is on duty near the state borders.</b>
<b>l've spoken to the party from Dubai.</b>
<b>They'll get their goods</b>
<b>at Goraibunder.</b>
<b>You will have to cross the</b>
<b>state border with it.</b>
<b>Karan, smugglers have started their</b>
<b>new business at the state border.</b>
<b>They are dealing in drugs.</b>
<b>We have to be on our guard.</b>
<b>l have made tight</b>
<b>security arrangements.</b>
<b>Even an ant won't be able to escape.</b>
<b>The problem is that there is no</b>
<b>fixed time of him returning home.</b>
<b>l had asked him to come early today.</b>
<b>- What is Jindal doing nowadays?</b>
<b>The usual running around.</b>
<b>He does not want to work</b>
<b>with my father.</b>
<b>l am tired of making him understand.</b>
<b>You are his friend. Why don't</b>
<b>you make him understand?</b>
<b>Okay. My wife and son will be</b>
<b>returning the-day-after tomorrow.</b>
<b>We will eat together and l shall</b>
<b>talk to him.</b>
<b>Mr Karan Saxena is coming.</b>
<b>Lift the barrier.</b>
<b>What's in the taxi?</b>
<b>- ls everything okay?</b>
<b>We are searching every vehicle.</b>
<b>- Good.</b>
<b>Drop the barrier.</b>
<b>When will l get my share, Tyson?</b>
<b>- l will do the deal...</b>
<b>in the day tomorrow.</b>
<b>You'll get your share at night here.</b>
<b>Do not worry. The share will be</b>
<b>equally distributed.</b>
<b>No way!</b>
<b>l have taken the risks!</b>
<b>l crossed the border!</b>
<b>Therefore, l will get half the share.</b>
<b>You share the rest.</b>
<b>The share will be divided equally now.</b>
<b>Between you and me.</b>
<b>His share will be, to go to prison.</b>
<b>l did not know, that l had given</b>
<b>refuge in my home...</b>
<b>not to a friend but</b>
<b>a criminal.</b>
<b>lf you were not my friend, then l</b>
<b>would not arrest you but shoot you.</b>
<b>Mr. Kulkarni?</b>
<b>l am Pooja speaking.</b>
<b>lnspector Karan has just been murdered</b>
<b>Please come immediately...</b>
<b>A woman brings about a man's</b>
<b>downfall and success.</b>
<b>But l will not give you a chance</b>
<b>to destroy me!</b>
<b>My eyes!</b>
<b>l cannot see a thing!</b>
<b>They were 4 men. l do not know</b>
<b>who they were.</b>
<b>lnspector Saxena bravely fought them.</b>
<b>But...!</b>
<b>My wife tried to call the police.</b>
<b>But they strangled her.</b>
<b>After that, l don't know what</b>
<b>they put in my eyes.</b>
<b>l have become blind, lnspector.</b>
<b>Oome on, Amar.</b>
<b>Did you see the consequence for</b>
<b>acting tough with us, Jindal?</b>
<b>Be mute about us, or else l will</b>
<b>make you a dead man.</b>
<b>''ln this way, l made an unique</b>
<b>plan to deceive the world...</b>
<b>by putting on a force of being blind''</b>
<b>''l always sensed danger from</b>
<b>Kamdev Kulkarni.</b>
<b>''So his death was essential''</b>
<b>''And now my aim was destruction</b>
<b>of Tyson and Jibran's goods.</b>
<b>''So that l could be a kingpin''</b>
<b>''And to accomplish this,</b>
<b>l made you my pawn''</b>
<b>Forgive me, boss. lf l err now, then</b>
<b>l will be at your mercy.</b>
<b>Jibran, by coming at the right moment</b>
<b>today, you've been saved.</b>
<b>Why, Vishal?</b>
<b>Did you get any advice after</b>
<b>listening to my story?</b>
<b>My advice is that, Jindal is a</b>
<b>very cruel and heartless person.</b>
<b>l can destroy anything</b>
<b>that hinders my success.</b>
<b>l did not spare my wife's life.</b>
<b>How can l spare you?</b>
<b>l will have your body</b>
<b>blown into pieces!</b>
<b>Vishal, you?</b>
<b>What happened?</b>
<b>- That...</b>
<b>Your head is bleeding.</b>
<b>Let me apply some medicine.</b>
<b>How did you get such a deep</b>
<b>wound on your head?</b>
<b>Roma, listen to me.</b>
<b>- Quiet! You're bleeding badly.</b>
<b>Be quiet, Vishal. Talk after l</b>
<b>finish dressing you.</b>
<b>Sorry, l am on duty.</b>
<b>So, l did not knock the door.</b>
<b>Here is your criminal record.</b>
<b>Now, you cannot deny that...</b>
<b>you are responsible for</b>
<b>all the murders in the city.</b>
<b>You love to kill.</b>
<b>You are a professional killer.</b>
<b>Be good enough to...</b>
<b>- The truth is not what you think.</b>
<b>You'll lose your head</b>
<b>if you hear the truth.</b>
<b>The cat is out of the bag!</b>
<b>Hear Vishal out, Amar.</b>
<b>- No more pretense, Roma!</b>
<b>You got involved with him in just</b>
<b>one meeting in prison.</b>
<b>You worked hard</b>
<b>to have him released.</b>
<b>Wonder how many times you have</b>
<b>your lover refuge.</b>
<b>You have no right to insult me!</b>
<b>- Yes. Your lover has all the rights!</b>
<b>You are abusing my love.</b>
<b>lf you want to display your</b>
<b>strength, raise your hand on a man!</b>
<b>A man who seeks refuge behind</b>
<b>a woman, is not a man!</b>
<b>Sir, Mr. Jibran is here to meet you.</b>
<b>l had asked you not to come here.</b>
<b>Why have you come?</b>
<b>l had to .... Kashi!</b>
<b>- Ooming.</b>
<b>Why is he here?</b>
<b>Who is he?</b>
<b>He is Kashinath Sahu. He is our</b>
<b>pawn from the police force.</b>
<b>He has brought useful information,</b>
<b>big brother?...</b>
<b>Big brother?...</b>
<b>He is your big brother?</b>
<b>So, the doors of the Head Office</b>
<b>opens from here?</b>
<b>Mr. Jindal, Jibran must have told</b>
<b>you about my reporting charges.</b>
<b>Today, l'll charge 5000 per second.</b>
<b>lt is a special bulletin.</b>
<b>Quick! He has no time.</b>
<b>lnspector Amar Saxena has put</b>
<b>Vishal Agnihotri behind bars.</b>
<b>He has no chances of escaping now.</b>
<b>He is tough but he will reveal</b>
<b>everything by morning.</b>
<b>Nine seconds... Rs.45,000.</b>
<b>Meaning, he is yet alive?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>lf he reveals by morning,</b>
<b>then we will become criminals.</b>
<b>Yes. The time is not to</b>
<b>enjoy in a party.</b>
<b>Quickly, find a way out,</b>
<b>or by morning...!</b>
<b>By morning...</b>
<b>There are eight hours left</b>
<b>for dawn to break.</b>
<b>Tonight, l will find a new pawn.</b>
<b>By morning the tables will be turned.</b>
<b>He can see?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>l have never been so shocked</b>
<b>in my 12 years of duty.</b>
<b>Your dark glasses has deceived</b>
<b>the entire police department!</b>
<b>Hats off, Mr. Jindal!</b>
<b>l should touch the feet of such a</b>
<b>man... bless me.</b>
<b>Why are you looking</b>
<b>at me that way?</b>
<b>You don't look the bastard</b>
<b>that you are.</b>
<b>l am not exactly like my father!</b>
<b>Sir, my life is in your hands.</b>
<b>You are influential people; you</b>
<b>can escape.</b>
<b>But do not leave me in deep waters.</b>
<b>Only give us information about the</b>
<b>police. lt will be for your good.</b>
<b>l understand. l will</b>
<b>remain as a younger brother.</b>
<b>The elder one,... the younger one...</b>
<b>and Jibran in the middle.</b>
<b>Do you understand what l mean?</b>
<b>- Stop talking nonsense!</b>
<b>Understand what he is saying.</b>
<b>- l understand. Pertectly.</b>
<b>l am glad, you have come for our</b>
<b>party, Oommissioner.</b>
<b>What is it, Amar? How did you get</b>
<b>hurt on your head?</b>
<b>l have arrested Vishal.</b>
<b>- Vishal?</b>
<b>l have evidence about his murders</b>
<b>- What are you saying?</b>
<b>He will plead guilty very soon.</b>
<b>Now, whom do you want</b>
<b>to plead guilty here?</b>
<b>l've put that murderer behind bars.</b>
<b>Tomorrow, l'll have all the answers.</b>
<b>Why he is doing it and for whom?</b>
<b>You are late. The party began long back.</b>
<b>Mr Jindal has been waiting for you.</b>
<b>- He has inquired about you a lot.</b>
<b>You are looking beautiful, Roma.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>
<b>Stop joking.</b>
<b>Where is Mr. Jindal?</b>
<b>He was here a while back...</b>
<b>there he is..</b>
<b>l've been waiting</b>
<b>for you since long.</b>
<b>Your absence had me worried.</b>
<b>lf all our editors are not present</b>
<b>for our paper's party,...</b>
<b>then it seems incomplete.</b>
<b>This party is for you.</b>
<b>You should be near me...</b>
<b>let me introduce you to some people.</b>
<b>l know her. l have met her.</b>
<b>She is actually our sub-editor.</b>
<b>But in a span of few days,...</b>
<b>she has formed a strong bond</b>
<b>with our paper.</b>
<b>So, do you hold her responsible</b>
<b>for your success?</b>
<b>lf you wish, should l publish</b>
<b>this in the papers tomorrow?</b>
<b>Where are you going?</b>
<b>Wait.</b>
<b>You won't get milk or holy water</b>
<b>here. And you do not like alcohol!</b>
<b>Hold on empty glass . Maybe, it</b>
<b>will get you high!</b>
<b>He is drinking the whole bottle!</b>
<b>Excuse us. We've to meet some people.</b>
<b>Oone on, Roma.</b>
<b>To extinguish the fire in your heart,</b>
<b>take the help of words, not alcohol.</b>
<b>You have hurt your head,</b>
<b>but the pain is in your heart.</b>
<b>''Wish there were two hearts''</b>
<b>''Even if one heart were to break''</b>
<b>in love''</b>
<b>''There would be no pain in living''</b>
<b>''lt is true when people say''</b>
<b>''ln drunken ecstasy,</b>
<b>sorrow pervades''</b>
<b>''For any illness of the heart</b>
<b>The pain is pleasurable''</b>
<b>''When the heart is on fire,</b>
<b>then what is the harm in drinking''</b>
<b>''This grief can never be forgotten</b>
<b>lt will always remember''</b>
<b>''Someone inflicted me</b>
<b>with so much pain''</b>
<b>''That will agonize me</b>
<b>for a long time''</b>
<b>''This wound inflicted in the heart</b>
<b>cannot be healed''</b>
<b>''in months or years''</b>
<b>l asked you to wait as l had</b>
<b>something important to talk.</b>
<b>What is it, sir?</b>
<b>Amazing!</b>
<b>l cannot see you. But l can</b>
<b>completely feel you.</b>
<b>Your sorrow.</b>
<b>Your smile... laughter, worries...</b>
<b>l can guess all your feelings.</b>
<b>You can see and yet you cannot</b>
<b>empathize with my state?</b>
<b>l cannot understand what</b>
<b>you are saying, sir.</b>
<b>l'll tell you.</b>
<b>l want to marry you, Roma.</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>l had decided it long back.</b>
<b>So often, this matter would come to</b>
<b>my lips and l'd stop myself.</b>
<b>But maybe, the time to tell you</b>
<b>has come now.</b>
<b>How could you dream of such a</b>
<b>relationship with me?</b>
<b>l respect you, sir. And you know,</b>
<b>that l love Amar.</b>
<b>l too love you, Roma.</b>
<b>A thousand times more than Amar!</b>
<b>l have lovingly kept the matter</b>
<b>before you.</b>
<b>l wanted you to reciprocate lovingly.</b>
<b>lf you...</b>
<b>What is wrong with you, sir?</b>
<b>l am intoxicated.</b>
<b>This lovely face has made my crazy.</b>
<b>- How can you see...?</b>
<b>l want to seal these beautiful</b>
<b>lips with my love, now.</b>
<b>You can see me!</b>
<b>Since the last two years, this blind</b>
<b>man has drank your beauty.</b>
<b>from the eyes hidden behind</b>
<b>these glasses.</b>
<b>l cannot bear it any longer.</b>
<b>Do not touch me!</b>
<b>- Don't.</b>
<b>These delicate hands cannot do this.</b>
<b>These hands are meant to be kissed.</b>
<b>These hands are meant to be kissed.</b>
<b>- No l can never be yours!</b>
<b>l have not put a marriage proposal</b>
<b>before you. l told you my decision.</b>
<b>Now this neck should move only in</b>
<b>the affirmative.</b>
<b>Tomorrow's headline...</b>
<b>- He can see, Mr. Siddiqui!</b>
<b>What are you doing?</b>
<b>Such a disgraceful</b>
<b>behavior with Roma!</b>
<b>Save me, Mr. Siddiqui.</b>
<b>Leave her.</b>
<b>Or l shall bare you in the headlines</b>
<b>of the papers tomorrow!</b>
<b>All right, l shall leave her.</b>
<b>But the headlines in the papers</b>
<b>tomorrow will be...</b>
<b>the murder of the editor of</b>
<b>the paper 'Samadhan'.</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>You must be thinking, that l have</b>
<b>called you here for interrogation.</b>
<b>And that l will make you</b>
<b>plead guilty?</b>
<b>Unlock this handcuffs. Do it!</b>
<b>l am releasing you</b>
<b>on my responsibility.</b>
<b>l am very happy with your release.</b>
<b>Oongratulations.</b>
<b>You are surprised with your</b>
<b>release, aren't you?</b>
<b>Do you know, why l have released you?</b>
<b>Because after l retire</b>
<b>l'll be content that...</b>
<b>l did one noble deed for the police.</b>
<b>What are you doing, sir?</b>
<b>You know, he's guilty and has played</b>
<b>with the law. Yet you release him?</b>
<b>Yes, because l know what l am doing.</b>
<b>The court will punish him but</b>
<b>crime will not be eradicated.</b>
<b>Enough sir!</b>
<b>l know your true colors today.</b>
<b>All your life, you sold the law,</b>
<b>sitting on this chair.</b>
<b>l am right! You took undue advantage</b>
<b>of your position.</b>
<b>You have always stopped the hands</b>
<b>that arrests the culprits...</b>
<b>You've given refuge to</b>
<b>such criminals.</b>
<b>You misunderstand me, Amar.</b>
<b>- l understand you well!</b>
<b>My father sacrificed his life</b>
<b>for duty.</b>
<b>But you closed his file as you didn't</b>
<b>want his murderers arrested.</b>
<b>You are sold out!</b>
<b>The truth is not,</b>
<b>what you think it is.</b>
<b>There is only one culprit who has</b>
<b>involved all of us. And he is Jindal.</b>
<b>What are you saying?</b>
<b>- Yes, Sir. lt is Jindal.</b>
<b>l was doing all this for Jindal.</b>
<b>After he released me from prison,</b>
<b>be instigated me to kill.</b>
<b>He made me a victim</b>
<b>of his conspiracy.</b>
<b>And made me think that l was</b>
<b>eradicating evil from society.</b>
<b>He made me kill his enemies because</b>
<b>he wants to become the kingpin.</b>
<b>He also wanted me to kill you.</b>
<b>He has put on a charade of being</b>
<b>blind, only to deceive the police.</b>
<b>Jindal has all your answers too.</b>
<b>The murderer of your father, for</b>
<b>whom you've been searching...</b>
<b>is none other than, Jindal.</b>
<b>Did you hear the bells of death?</b>
<b>You recognized me.</b>
<b>You've come fully prepared.</b>
<b>But what is the use now?</b>
<b>Your prey has escaped.</b>
<b>Where will you escape? We will</b>
<b>find you wherever you are.</b>
<b>You can only talk like a fool.</b>
<b>You should have been a constable</b>
<b>instead of a Oommissioner.</b>
<b>You're talking a lot. Anyway, l have</b>
<b>prepared a noose for your neck.</b>
<b>You cannot do a thing, Kamdev.</b>
<b>l will do the needful. Once l make</b>
<b>my mind, then l do what l think.</b>
<b>l get what l like.</b>
<b>To make moves, in my habit.</b>
<b>So what if you have a pawn?</b>
<b>The queen is with me.</b>
<b>What are you doing there?</b>
<b>- Jindal brought me here forcefully.</b>
<b>He is a very dangerous man.</b>
<b>He murdered Mr. Siddiqui...</b>
<b>He will kill you too.</b>
<b>Do not risk your life for me.</b>
<b>Be brave. l won't spare him.</b>
<b>His time has come.</b>
<b>Bravo! Karan Saxena's blood</b>
<b>speaks just like him!</b>
<b>lf you were in front of me,</b>
<b>l would have thrashed you!</b>
<b>Ohild, use your brains</b>
<b>instead of your fists!</b>
<b>Do what Roma says.</b>
<b>l will give you a fitting reply!</b>
<b>Get my father-in-law when you reply.</b>
<b>He will get his daughter married,</b>
<b>won't he?</b>
<b>Sir, tell me where he is?</b>
<b>l will fix him!</b>
<b>He called us to give us his address!</b>
<b>Amar, we have to think about</b>
<b>Roma's life too...</b>
<b>Just a minute, sir.</b>
<b>- Yes?</b>
<b>Think! Jindal escaped overnight.</b>
<b>He called exactly when we came here.</b>
<b>This proves that he gets all the</b>
<b>information about our plans.</b>
<b>Amar is right. Jindal knew beforehand</b>
<b>that the police were coming.</b>
<b>lmplying, that there is a traitor</b>
<b>in our department.</b>
<b>And he is present now amongst us.</b>
<b>But l...</b>
<b>l will recognize him.</b>
<b>Tell me, traitor!</b>
<b>Didn't you inform Jindal?</b>
<b>You're wrong. l haven't done anything.</b>
<b>- Didn't you?</b>
<b>Take him away!</b>
<b>- Please believe me, sir!</b>
<b>Living in the land of Gandhi and being</b>
<b>a policeman, you commit treason!</b>
<b>Amar, l hope, you are not wrong.</b>
<b>Kranti can never do this.</b>
<b>Sir, l have shot in the dark.</b>
<b>lf it hits the bulls-eye...</b>
<b>then we will find the first</b>
<b>step to reach Jindal.</b>
<b>Rs.10000 per second? Quickly tell me,</b>
<b>what important information you have.</b>
<b>The police are being misled. They've</b>
<b>arrested Krantikumar instead of me.</b>
<b>Now, it is impossible</b>
<b>to reach Mr. Jindal.</b>
<b>10 Seconds... a hundred</b>
<b>thousand rupees.</b>
<b>A hundred thousand rupees!</b>
<b>Ghost!</b>
<b>lf he has committed suicide in prison,</b>
<b>why is his soul wandering here?</b>
<b>Now your soul is going to wander.</b>
<b>Kashi, you are trapped!</b>
<b>He rules the whole of Europe.</b>
<b>ln the international market...</b>
<b>everybody wants to have their</b>
<b>name associated with you.</b>
<b>Why not? He is lndia's Orime king.</b>
<b>Right, big brother?</b>
<b>Hence, l am thrilled that he has</b>
<b>made me his business partner.</b>
<b>l have meticulously selected men from</b>
<b>this country to supply the goods.</b>
<b>There are no police records on them.</b>
<b>Tomorrow's meeting will leave a mark</b>
<b>in the history of this country.</b>
<b>Because in future... blood will not</b>
<b>flow in the veins of this country.</b>
<b>But the poison which</b>
<b>we supply will flow.</b>
<b>This drug is going to</b>
<b>turn on the heat.</b>
<b>lt will make Roma forget</b>
<b>all sense of decency.</b>
<b>Then she'll give in to me with all</b>
<b>the gusto of a newly-wedded bride!</b>
<b>No! Please!</b>
<b>Friends, as was decided,....</b>
<b>all of you will deal in drugs</b>
<b>in your provinces and area.</b>
<b>And just wait and watch...</b>
<b>how l make, not millionaires,</b>
<b>but billionaires of you in an year.</b>
<b>lt is important to bear in mind</b>
<b>three things for our success.</b>
<b>Firstly, instead of being dishonest</b>
<b>with each other, unite!</b>
<b>Where are you going?</b>
<b>- l am Jibran's man.</b>
<b>l have information for Mr. Jindal.</b>
<b>- Search him.</b>
<b>Secondly, we should have</b>
<b>the dedication...</b>
<b>to reach drugs to every city, every</b>
<b>village and every home in the country.</b>
<b>Stop! Where are the car keys?</b>
<b>Thirdly, anyone hindering our way,</b>
<b>will be made to keep shut.</b>
<b>lf not with money, then with bullets.</b>
<b>So, are you ready?</b>
<b>- Yes, we are.</b>
<b>Why are you landing me in a soup?</b>
<b>- Oome on.</b>
<b>Go on.</b>
<b>- l am.</b>
<b>lt is our first and last</b>
<b>meeting today.</b>
<b>Tomorrow, l am going abroad</b>
<b>with my future bride.</b>
<b>And we will be married</b>
<b>the day-after-tomorrow.</b>
<b>Oongratulations!... in advance.</b>
<b>Why are you here?</b>
<b>- To congratulate big brother.</b>
<b>How did you dare to enter here</b>
<b>without my permission?</b>
<b>l will die if l speak.</b>
<b>l will die even l do not.</b>
<b>l have been brought here.</b>
<b>Vishal and Amar are going to</b>
<b>finish you.</b>
<b>Above!</b>
<b>You want to escape?</b>
<b>Where will you escape?</b>
<b>Where will you escape?</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>You can't escape!</b>
<b>You cannot.</b>
<b>Leave me!</b>
<b>Run, Roma!</b>
<b>- Don't be foolish! Sit in the car.</b>
<b>Sit or l will blow</b>
<b>his brains apart!</b>
<b>Shut up!</b>
<b>Nobody can escape.</b>
<b>Stop there, lnspector! Or his body</b>
<b>won't be worthy of a post-mortem!</b>
<b>Do not worry about me, Amar!</b>
<b>Shoot him.</b>
<b>This lame horse and Queen</b>
<b>are with me, so do not act smart.</b>
<b>Drop your weapon.</b>
<b>Drop it!</b>
<b>Do not try to pursue me,</b>
<b>or you will regret it.</b>
<b>l swear by my father, that</b>
<b>someday l will shoot you!</b>
<b>You are in my captivity and yet</b>
<b>you behave so arrogantly!</b>
<b>Now, do as l say.</b>
<b>On your knees.</b>
<b>- No, Amar!</b>
<b>On your knees!</b>
<b>- No, Amar!</b>
<b>Now rub your nose on the ground.</b>
<b>- Don't degrade yourself!</b>
<b>Do it!</b>
<b>- Don't!</b>
<b>Well done, lnspector!</b>
<b>Slap yourself.</b>
<b>- No, Amar.</b>
<b>Slap, yourself!</b>
<b>- No.</b>
<b>Slap yourself.</b>
<b>No, a tight slap.</b>
<b>Harder!</b>
<b>- Do not worry about me!</b>
<b>Now you'll see a policeman's</b>
<b>pants fall off.</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>Remove your pants.</b>
<b>- No.</b>
<b>This Policeman obeys!</b>
<b>- No.</b>
<b>He is removing his pants.</b>
<b>Very good.</b>
<b>Shoot him, Amar!</b>
<b>Shoot him!</b>
<b>Have courage! l will not</b>
<b>let you die...</b>
<b>You had promised me that you would</b>
<b>surrender to me.</b>
<b>You cannot cheat me!</b>
<b>l cheated myself.</b>
<b>l chose the wrong path.</b>
<b>You were right, friend.</b>
<b>l am proud of an officer like you.</b>
<b>l... l salute you.</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>Good news. The government has decided</b>
<b>to give Amar an award for bravery.</b>
<b>l'm giving him a prize too.</b>
<b>Next month, Roma marries Amar.</b>
<b>Great!</b>
<b>Will someone show the way</b>
<b>to a blind man please?</b>
<b>Anyone to help a blind man?</b>
<b>Kashi, you just escaped suspension.</b>
<b>- Mend your ways while there's time.</b>
<b>Jindal seems to have had</b>
<b>an effect on him.</b>
<b>Are you going to fool people now?</b>
<b>- No sir! That's not my point.</b>
<b>Government servants in our country</b>
<b>are like blind mice.</b>
<b>We toe the government's line blindly.</b>
<b>So it's the government's duty...</b>
<b>to take care of us. l only want the</b>
<b>government to consider the inflation.</b>
<b>Give us a raise. So we won't have to</b>
<b>look for these pay-per-second jobs.</b>
<b>Why not?</b>
<b>You deserve a raise in pension too.</b>
<b>You'll be comfortable after retiring.</b>
<b>The first time he comes up with...</b>
<b>- The million-dollar question!</b>
