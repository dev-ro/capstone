Okay.
Okay.
It's Wednesday, January 26th,
and you're listening
to 88.3 KPLP.
In just a few hours,
the Federal Reserve is
projected to raise
interest rates,
and we're told that
this is their main tool
to help lower inflation.
Can you just explain to us...
Sure, sure.
So, as everyone knows,
the prices are rising...
Exactly. And the spending...
The labor markets...
higher rate,
which obviously the
government does not want.
So, what the Fed
is saying is that
if they raise these
interest rates,
if they make these commodities
such as cars and houses
actually more expensive,
then fewer people will
be able to afford them.
This will lower the demand
and give the supply the chance
to catch up...
Right.
- So, tell us the story...
of how we got here.
When did all this start?
So, our story starts...
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
It's okay. It's okay.
Stop it...
Help me.
How?

Across the inside

from grabbing you.
Otherwise his extremities
will be able to block...
I can get inside his defense

Cut here.
Now I'm getting
positive stab and cut.
Now remember, make sure
that you twist the blade,
torquing your blade
to the left...
Now I cut directly across...

So I stab upwards,
