Great. Gunshots. Perfect.
It's just a backfire.
Like you'd know.
Face it, man. We are lost.
Hold on a second.
We're here.
Where the hell are you?
Why don't your bitch ass
look behind you...
and see what's crackin', man?
I got this.
Let me see it.
''Let me see it''?
Let me see it, man.
Show him the fucking money.
Show him. Show him.
Where is it?
You think I got it
in my pocket, man?
Yeah.
I can't go get it, man.
Y'all might be the po-po.
I ain't no po-po.
You got to get it yourseIf, man.
It's around the corner,
down the bIock...
by the...
What's that, nigger?
Loose brick,
north side of the buiIding.
Go, man. Bounce.
Let me go on record, Jason.
This is a reaIIy bad idea.
There it is.
Nice.
It's easy as pie...
and twice as tasty.
Man, someone's screwing
with my car!
Come on.
Come on, in here!
I saw them go in.
This is a waste of fucking time.
Come on.
Forget it.
There's no way they're in there.
Trust me. I've been
working here for 20 years.
There's nobody in there.
Let's go.
Fucking donut shop shuts
in Iess than five minutes.
AII right.
Oh, God damn it!
Let's get the heII out of here.
Dude, that was cIose.
Yeah.
What the fuck was that?
Fuck.
Where'd it go?
I don't care.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Go!
Go, go, go! Come on!
What the heII was that?
Hey, you!
Get away from there!
Get!
Dude, Iet's get out of here.
I'm right behind you, man.
Oh, man.
PaImer!
Somebody heIp me!
Somebody heIp!
''For outside are
dogs and sorcerers--''
ReveIation 22: verse 15.
-Hey, check it out.
-Jimmy, over here.
Yeah. PIace your bets.
What's your number?
That must be your birthday, huh?
Get your money right.
Put it in here, baby.
Let's get these numbers running.
-You aII right?
-Yeah.
This Iooks Iike a damn graveyard
around here, bro.
This neighborhood's
making a comeback.
Where the heII has it been?
This is the ugIiest buiIding
I've ever seen.
I don't know.
There's something about
this buiIding.
It just drew me.
AII right,
you know something?
I was pIanning
on doing this...
after I got the pIace
cIeaned up and whatnot...
but, Iike the man says,
carpe diem.
What do you think about this,
IittIe sis?
That's us.
''IIIbient''?
Whose cIub is that?
Ours.
What do you mean, ours?
Like I said, ours.
Come on, check it out.
-In this?
-Yes.
Patrick,
what are you thinking?
This is prehistoric.
Can you picture it, though?
Look, we couId have
the bar right here.
Dance fIoor.
-Yo, BiII.
-What?
DJ booth, right there.
Anything's possibIe,
but that's a Iot of work.
Oh, Jesus.
TeII me that's part of a dog
or something.
Yeah, that's dog.
That's from a cat or something.
It's a pretty big cat,
Patrick.
Cat, dog, whatever.
I got a reaIIy great deaI
on this pIace.
A reaIIy great deaI, man.
They couIdn't give it away.
It was dead meat stinking up
their books for 20 years.
Don't do that, Maurice.
Stop pIaying, man.
ChiII.
The Iast owner on the Iease,
before the bank...
was back in '79.
Some cat named Jimmy Bones.
It's been empty ever since.
Jimmy Bones?
-You heard of him?
-You haven't?
Not that I can remember.
He was a IocaI Iegend
back in the Seventies.
Sure.
There was a song--
Sing it for me, baby. Come on.
Let's do this. Ready?
This is the story of Jimmy Bones
BIack as night and hard as stone
Sorry.
Something about a deuce.
A switchbIade and...
A switchbIade and a diamond.
Get yourseIf a coupIe of doIIars
and buy a piece of candy.
Say, ''Thank you, UncIe Jimmy.''
Thank you, UncIe Jimmy.
Jimmy Bones.
Aw, Maurice. Jimmy Bones.
How bad-ass is that?
Jimmy Bones!
Patrick, I'm going
to teII you something.
I'm soId, baby,
and I'II teII you why.
This is what I'm thinking.
We couId use this whoIe
Jimmy Bones theme...
to make this pIace off the hook.
Look at this pIace, man.
It's a dump.
ActuaIIy, it'd have
to work to be a dump.
Look at the rest of the pIace
before you tear it down.
I know it's coId.
I'II run downstairs,
fire up the furnace...
see if I can warm the joint up
a IittIe bit...
and you'II see.
This pIace has
serious potentiaI, man.
PotentiaI to Ieave me
seriousIy injured.
I'm gonna check out how to get
the DJ equipment up there.
Who's coming?
Aw, man.
Aw, shit.
Am I trippin'?
I'm going this way.
Yeah, me, too.
No, you won't, buddy.
You're going
to foIIow me upstairs.
Tia, be carefuI.
Oh, shit!
Fucking rats.
PIease don't bust,
because I can't afford that.
What's up?
Contact paranoia.
Maybe you heard of it.
I'm buggin' from hanging
with you aII the time.
I teII you, goddamn, man.
WeII, I got bigger probIems.
I can't get this joint Iit.
That's drug abuse.
Things are nuts down here
without you squawking that up.
Maurice?
BiII?
Hey...buddy.
How Iong you been
Iocked in here?
Want my burger?
Damn, you were hungry.
You want us to move in here?
That's the onIy way we'II get
the pIace fixed in time.
Yeah, right.
And whichever of us
is aIive by the end of week...
inherits aII
of Vincent Price's cash.
You want to pIay coIIege radio,
high schooI reunions...
and some fooI's cIub once a week
for the rest of your Iives...
that's cooI,
but I think we can do better.
I put everything I got
into this...
because I beIieve
we can make it happen.
We move in. We take shifts.
Enough with
the motivationaI speech.
I'm down, aII right?
Thank you.
He has a good track record,
so just go with him.
Fine. Mars needs
a IittIe bit of Venus.
If I'm going to sIeep
in a spook house...
surround me with chicks
more scared than me.
Speaking of which...
Why wouId you say that
about my sister, man?
-Oh, shit.
-Look who I found.
What? Tia.
That's the nastiest dog
I ever seen.
He's not as ugIy
as some peopIe I know.
Anyway, I'm naming him Bones.
Bones?
Let's go get the stuff
we need and bring it back.
-Shotgun.
-Shotgun.
-I said it first.
-No, you hear things Iate.
By the way...
Dad does know about this, right?
Are you kidding?
Patrick, man--
It's going to be cooI, bro.
I'm teIIing you.
Hey!
What y'aII doing over there
with that dog?
Is he yours?
Is he yours, sir?
HeII, no!
What do you care, then?
I'II teII you something, boy.
Shoot that dog.
Shoot the dog?
Whatever you say, sir.
I think it's nappy time.
Come on, Bones.
Tia, put him in the back.
Don't feed that dog!
What the heII's wrong
with you?
Some hoIes can't be fiIIed...
and some hunger
can't be satisfied.
Some peopIe need to stagger
their medication.
I'm serious!
He'II onIy get hungrier.
Come on, Cynthia.
Y'aII peopIe
reaIIy don't Iike dogs.
Ma'am, you need any heIp
with those bags?
No, thank you.
ReaIIy, Iet us heIp.
We just moved
into the neighborhood.
We're going to be neighbors.
Let me heIp you out.
You moved onto this bIock?
Not reaIIy to Iive,
but to pIay.
See, I'm a DJ, right?
In that buiIding?
It's going to be Ie hot shit.
Pardon my Francais.
We're making it a dance cIub.
Ever heard of
the Resurrection Brothers?
ShouId I?
Are they on the radio?
Nah, but they wiII be.
They're the best.
How do you know?
-I manage them.
-It's us.
And you bought that buiIding?
Wait a minute.
You Iook a IittIe famiIiar.
Are you sure
you're not from around here?
I was born near here...
but after my mom died,
Dad moved to South.
I grew up in Rossmore Park.
You're a IittIe dark
to grow up in Rossmore Park.
Yo, she's fine.
I guess this is not
Rossmore Park, but...
thanks for the heIp.
Hey, anytime.
Here.
I guess
I'II be seeing you, then.
It was nice to meet you.
If she has psychic powers...
how come she's working
here in DesoIation Row?
Come on, man.
What happened to the CoIoneI?
A gangsta of Iove
don't eat no fried chicken.
Why not?
You eat everything eIse.
The whoIe chicken distribution
network is owned by the KIan.
Man, don't even go there.
When's the Iast time
you seen a bIack chicken farm?
Yeah, speciaI recipe.
There's something in the batter
that makes a bIack man steriIe.
-BuIIshit.
-Now hoId up, man.
Why are you so concerned with
the pIight of the bIack man?
Last time I checked,
you was not bIack.
I don't know
exactIy what you are...
but you damn sure
ain't no bIack man.
I am the future, aII right?
I am the meIting pot.
You been smoking pot.
I'm the tossed saIad.
I am
Martin Luther King's dream.
AII I got to do
is hoId my own hand.
I am post-raciaI.
You're post-toasted.
Post-apocaIyptic,
more IikeIy.
You're making my head hurt.
Just eat your food.
Eddie, man, what's wrong, nigga?
How many times
I done toId y'aII, man?
When I'm pIaying
this game here...
don't interrupt me.
We just hooked you up
with a tight Viper.
We are paid, nigga.
Viper!
A Viper?
A Viper you stoIe
off them white boys Iast night?
Yep, yep, yep.
Like that, nigga.
Just Iike that.
Are y'aII out
your motherfucking mind?
No.
Man, everybody heard
that damn screaming...
Iast night on BIackstone.
Remember that shit?
How many times I toId
you two knuckIehead niggers?
No psycho shit.
If there's going to be
any psycho shit...
I'm the one that do it.
We know that.
We respect that.
That's why we didn't do shit.
You didn't Ginsu them punks
and steaI their ride?
SteaI their ride.
That's aII we did.
That's aII we did.
Man, get that car
the fuck away from here...
you understand?
This is the type of shit
I'm taIking about.
I pay the pigs good money
to keep shit cooI around here...
and this is the shit
that pisses everybody off.
Boy, if I didn't know
your mama--
We just thought--
No more thinking
from neither one of you!
Because I wiII burn your asses
and snort your asses.
Now get the fuck out of here.
Beat it.
And do something
with your hair, nigga.
Get out of here.
What make a motherfucker
take his reaI teeth...
and put--I don't
understand that shit.
You're just
a misunderstood genius.
Dad is going to kick ass.
He doesn't Iike dogs in
the house in the first pIace.
AII right. I toId you so.
Hey, you guys.
Hi, Mom.
Tia...what's this?
-It's a dog.
-I can see that.
Why'd you Iet her bring it in
in the first pIace?
She's hardheaded.
She don't Iisten to me.
Excuse me.
Let me see
if I've got this right.
Not onIy do I have to feed
the three mouths I've got...
pIus Maurice
the bottomIess pit...
I have to feed
this stray dog, too?
Bones, it's not nice to bite
the hand that feeds you.
What did you caII him?
Bones.
You cannot keep that dog.
Hey, hey, hey.
What's up, Jimmy B?
What's going on, bIood?
I got it aII arranged
for you tonight, Jimmy.
Eddie Mack's
going to be there...
and Officer Koruptsky, too.
Got it aII Iaid out
for you, baby.
They've got 12 minutes, tops.
Jimmy, trust me on this, man.
There's some big money
behind this, baby.
Not just big--
I mean big business big...
Iike big corporation big,
big government big.
One word,
three IittIe Ietters--
Y-e-s. That's aII
it's going to take.
We can move out of this dump,
hit the big time--
big houses,
Iegitimate business, the works.
That's your dream, not mine.
I don't ever want
to Ieave this street.
Never.
Status quo is totaIIy
cooI with me, baby.
I hear you, Jimmy.
I'm with you, baby.
-Be good.
-AII right, baby.
I hear you, Jimmy.
You got aII the status...
and I ain't got nothin'
but the quo.
Officer SIupovich...
aka Loopy Lou.
It's not your styIe...
is it, Eddie Mack...
kiIIing off
your customers?
I ain't kiIIed nobody.
You want me to rack 'em up?
PIay a game?
Too bad.
No time to pIay today.
Got your tip.
Confiscated the whoIe stash.
That's fair enough...
for the shit.
Don't you think I deserve
something a IittIe extra...
for knocking out
the competition?
Shit, you was just doing
your motherfuckin' job.
The Iast thing you need...
is for me to start doing
my fucking job.
Give that motherfucker
his money.
That's more Iike it.
That's the cost of
doing business.
Maybe you can deduct it
on your taxes.
Fuck you.
What's up with Jeremiah
seIIing that buiIding?
What?
That's ridicuIous, Patrick.
So how exactIy did crack
get in the ghetto, Pop?
By magic?
How did it fIy in there?
Like the man said,
we don't own that many pIanes.
Stop poisoning your mind
with that ghetto paranoia.
That's the ways of peopIe
justifying their own faiIure.
No, no, no, Dad.
The man has been Iying to us
for a hundred years.
Thank you.
I'm stiII waiting for
my 40 acres and a muIe.
You wouIdn't know a muIe
if one bit you in the ass.
PersonaIIy, I don't need a muIe.
I've got myseIf a Lexus.
And nobody gave it to me.
PIease, Pops--
I'd Iike to see the news,
pIease.
...in the strange
disappearance...
of those two State CoIIege
fraternity brothers.
Now, Patrick, I'm teIIing--
SIick.
What is that?
What's that aII about?
-Nothin'.
-What were you gonna say?
Some terribIe shit, Pops.
Better watch your mouth, boy.
Those boys had no business
messing around down there.
You go pIaces where
you're not meant to be...
and that's what you get.
Isn't that your oId hood, Pops?
Yes, that's my oId hood...
and it took some doing
to get out of there.
You just be gIad that I did...
so you can start your Iife
here instead of down there.
ShouIdn't we
maybe be down there?
Doing something about it,
making it better?
It can't be done, Patrick!
That pIace has aIready
died and gone to heII.
Want me to get that, honey?
No, I'II get it.
AI Lupovich.
Long time no see.
I'II be just a second, honey.
What the fuck do you want?
Wanted to visit
with my oId paI J-Bird.
Don't caII me that.
That's quite a brood
you got there.
A reguIar Rainbow CoaIition.
What the heII do you want,
Lupovich?
You soId the buiIding.
What buiIding?
Don't shit a shitter.
Our buiIding!
You were supposed to sit on it,
not seII it.
I didn't seII it.
Somebody bought it,
so somebody soId it.
Not my probIem.
That's a bozo no-no, J-Bird.
Even if they find anything,
it's been 20 years.
They couId never
trace it back to us.
You better hope not,
'cause it's Iike they say...
four can keep a secret
if three are dead.
Daddy?
Hey, Tia.
I'm just taIking to a friend.
I'II be right in.
Nice rack.
How oId is she?
Does she...you know?
That's my daughter, Lupovich.
Get the fuck off my property.
Your daughter.
Nice to see you.
You fat bastard.
Son of a bitch.
Got it. And twist.
I don't know what we're gonna
do with this pIace, boy.
It's aII good.
It's ugIy, but it's home.
You know that's bad Iuck, right?
That pIace is bad Iuck.
Why's that?
I don't know.
It goes way back.
Or so my mother says.
What eIse does your mama say?
You know, nothin' much.
If I toId you,
you'd think she was crazy.
And one thing
my mother is not is crazy.
OK. So?
AII right.
I can't beIieve
I'm teIIing you this.
My mother says
that every house is two houses.
Every street, two streets.
Two's good.
There's a whoIe city,
a whoIe worId...
kind of beside, on top...
just beIow...
the city of the dead.
There's this invisibIe waII...
a fabric that keeps
things separate.
Lucky thing.
Sure is, but when
something bad happens...
something reaIIy bad...
the waII breaks, tears.
And the dead get out?
Or the Iiving faII in.
Who knows?
And you beIieve it?
If I did, do you think...
I'd come within
50 yards of your door?
Get out!
Y'aII better stop
messin' around!
Go, boy!
What the fuck!
Freak!
What's the matter, bro?
Are you spooked?
Maybe just a IittIe,
aII right?
I know. There is kind of
a strange vibe up in here.
Make yourseIf comfortabIe
around the circIe.
We wiII begin in just a moment.
You gonna join us?
Can't. Gotta finish
this for schooI.
God gave you the vision.
I hate to see you waste it
on painting pretty pictures.
You got your vision
and I got mine...
and I won't waste mine
Iike you did.
Sorry, Mama. Maybe next time?
I don't want you to go
to that house anymore...
and I want you to stay away
from those kids and that dog.
That dog is a servant of eviI.
Ever been inside?
Yeah, back in the day.
Before it became what it is.
And what's that?
It's a bad pIace...
and a door to worse.
I gots to T.C.B. tonight...
so I shouId be through
about 7:00.
Come see me.
Can't I get there earIy
and give you some good Iuck?
No, baby. You know
I don't need no Iuck.
I'm just Ietting them
have their say...
before I teII them no.
AII right,
Iet me see your hands.
Come on,
Iet me see your hands.
-Come on, baby.
-PIease?
AII that readin',
advisin', shiny mess...
that was your mama's bag.
It was my mama's bag
and her grandmama...
and a Iong Iine of mamas
before her.
Sounds Iike Mama needs
a brand-new bag.
Let me see your hands.
PIease?
Your Ieft hand is the past...
your right hand
is the present and the future.
This is your Iife Iine,
and this--
Jimmy, there's a Iine across
your Iife Iine.
Must be my cIothesIine.
Maybe my phone Iine.
Jimmy, I'm serious!
CanceI the meeting.
Don't go. Stay with me.
Don't you worry
about nothin', baby.
These hands wiII be
stroking your neck tonight.
Jimmy, pIease!
PearI, trust me.
Thought you might be
needing some heIp.
Look at this, man.
It Iooks Iike bIood.
The fIoor's throbbing.
Aw, snap.
It feeIs Iike a heartbeat.
It's just a probIem
in the pIumbing.
You're probabIy right...
but I'm gonna check it out...
and y'aII are coming with me.
Come on.
-Whoa!
-Damn!
What is this?
Look at this, man!
Maurice,
what you think that is?
It's rust. Rust never sIeeps.
You caII that rust?
Now where does this go, huh?
Don't ask me.
Now what?
Eat that spinach, boy.
-There you go.
-You got it.
I'm not going down there.
Go ahead, Tia.
I'm right behind you.
Don't get behind me.
Just some fIies. Come on.
What is that smeII?
What'd you expect, Cynthia?
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.
FIies, there's shit!
Disgusting!
Space that's so perfect
for a recording studio?
Maurice, not now.
Just shut up, man.
He got a point, though.
It'II just take a IittIe more
work than I thought.
Think about it.
Put down a reaI fIoor.
Put some dampening
on the waII...
we'II have
totaIIy controIIed sound.
It'II be perfect.
We'II make our first record
where no one can hear us scream.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit.
Give me some Iight.
HeIIo. Who are you?
Ladies and gentIemen,
boys and girIs...
I'd Iike you to meet
Jimmy Bones.
What are you taIking about?
''This is the story
of Jimmy Bones...
''bIack as night
and hard as stone.
''GoId-pIated deuce
Iike the king of Siam...
''got a switchbIade Ioose
and a diamond on his hand.''
There's the switchbIade
and the diamond, man.
You teIIing me
this couId be him?
Damn. It's so fresh.
Put that thing down!
What are you doing?
You can't take that.
It might be evidence!
Evidence of what?
Patrick, doesn't it seem
a IittIe odd to you...
that he'd stab himseIf
in the chest and bury himseIf?
I agree.
Bones, settIe down!
Do something about the dog.
What we have to do
is caII the poIice.
For someone so cute,
you're so stupid sometimes.
CaII the poIice,
we don't get a permit.
We can't just Ieave him,
can we?
-Yes, we can.
-What?!
He ain't goin' nowhere.
We wiII deaI with this
after the weekend.
-Let's go!
-Fuck it, whatever!
You put your fingers
aII over it!
Maurice,
I'II Ieave you down here.
I'm coming!
Cyn?
What?
You aII right?
Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.
Patrick, what up?
I'm coming.
-Come on.
-I'm coming.
I guess
he won't be needing this.
Or this.
WeII, you know
she doesn't want me here.
With you...in this house.
Whatever.
It's true.
She doesn't trust you...
and neither do I.
I can handIe your mother.
-No, you can't.
-Yes, I can.
She wiII Iove me, watch.
No, she won't. Trust me.
See, but the X-factor
is your daddy.
I don't know nothin'
about him.
Neither do I.
I never met him.
She won't taIk about him.
Ever.
Wow. I'm sorry.
Don't be. It's OK.
I'm not sad about it.
It's Iife, you know?
I've never known him,
so it's totaIIy normaI to me.
I'm not doing too weII
with this.
Yeah, you are.
Patrick, stop.
What?
I can't.
AII right.
Do you want me to take you home?
No. I want to stay
with you guys--
No, no, no.
You don't have to expIain.
I understand.
I'II go sIeep with the guys.
Thank you.
You're weIcome.
'Night.
WeIcome...
my brothers and my sisters.
We wiII begin with our hymn.
The spirit worId is
aII around us at this moment...
and the dearIy departed
are here...
among us,
pressing around us.
It's OK. You can stay.
But no getting fresh.
This is nice.
There is a spirit among us.
Who has just joined our circIe?
Lordy, what is that smeII?
Stop. Patrick, cut it out.
Does someone
want to send a message?
Knock once for yes
and twice for no.
Is it someone in our circIe?
Stop.
Is it Miss LiIIian?
Cut it out.
Is the message
for Miss Abernathy?
Patrick, stop.
Is the message for me?
Patrick, stop! Stop!
No! Jimmy! No!
Patrick, stop!
What's wrong?
That sounds Iike your mom.
Open up this door!
What the heII are you doing?
Where's my daughter?
I want to see her now!
You hoId on a moment,
I'II go upstairs--
Come on out here!
I know she's in there!
Cynthia!
Oh, God! Come on, baby.
It'II be OK.
We're gonna get outta here.
Come on.
If you stay in this house
one more night...
you might as weII
be sIeeping in your grave!
Come on.
You certainIy have
a way with women, Patrick.
WeII, we're in business.
What?
Where we going?
You know I hate surprises.
It's a IittIe business venture
I made on my own...
I wanted to show you.
I think you wiII approve.
I hope so.
I hope so.
What are we doing down here?
Like you aIways said...
we need to Iook for
the undervaIued.
It don't get no more
undervaIued than this.
Come on, Pop. Just come on.
Bet you didn't know
your company owned this pIace.
I went through a broker,
so you didn't know it was me...
but I couIdn't wait
to see your face...
when you saw
how I fixed it up.
Look at this.
Son, is this
some kind of sick joke?
No! Look, Pop.
You Iisten to me, boy.
I didn't work
aII of my goddamn Iife...
to get out of
this neighborhood...
for you to move
right back in it!
I thought you'd be proud of me.
I'm just trying
to do what you did--
take nothing and
make something out of it.
Nobody wiII ever
come down here, son.
Look at this
fucking neighborhood!
Son...shut it down.
Shut it down.
The company wiII buy it back.
No. Not this time, Pop.
I did this on my own,
and we wiII open tonight!
BuIIshit!
That is buIIshit!
SeII it back!
That is a fucking order!
Do you fucking hear me?!
Shut it!
You shut it, god damn it!
Shut it down
and seII this fucker!
Shut it, Patrick--
What's goin' on, baby?
Jimmy's into it, man.
That's what I'm saying.
Just wait.
Jimmy, what's happening, baby?
Good to see you.
You remember Eddie Mack,
don't you?
We met.
We did the afterschooI
b-baII thing at Kenwood.
What it is, homeboy?
What it wiII be.
Jimmy, you know
Officer Lupovich, right?
I've heard of him.
Man, you got a nice crib here.
It's nice to see
a bIack man doing so weII.
Everybody's happy.
We do aII right.
But things change.
You gotta think ahead.
Got them Iotteries
aII over now, Bonesy.
Starting here, too.
Maybe next year.
Yeah, Jimmy.
A Iot of our oId customers...
are getting their new peopIe
across the state Iines...
buying those Iotto tickets.
We need to get
on this thing fast.
What do anybody want with
them damn Iottery tickets?
What eIse, youngbIood?
Money.
No, man.
It ain't the money.
It's the high.
The big fat fIoating
''What if?''
Dig, it's way
more profitabIe, man.
Nobody ever wins,
so you never pay out.
But a $2 bet is cheaper
than a $20 bag.
I can dig that,
but I'm not taIking horse.
I'm taIking
a $5 kick in the head...
that's a quick ticket
to heaven, man.
And fooIs keep coming back.
AII right, baby.
Those fooIs?
They're my peopIe.
I can dig that, man,
but it ain't no thing.
It's a poor man's freebase.
Check it out.
I ain't interested,
and if you gonna seII it...
don't seII it around here.
Man, here, just try it.
I said, no, thanks.
-Man, try this!
-Hey, Huggybear!
I done drove aII this way, man!
Hey! Back off.
Sit down!
That's cooI.
I'm copastetic.
But it's Iike this here, man.
It's the wave comin', man.
A big-ass, Krakatoa,
east of Java wave.
Either you gonna be on top...
up here in
chocoIate heaven...
or you'II get caught up
in the muddy undertow.
And that's reaI.
That's beautifuI, baby.
TotaIIy widescreen
sci-fi forward thinking...
and I can dig that...
but that's for you and yours.
Me and mines...
we cooI as a motherfuckin'
icicIe in the freezer.
By the way,
your 12 1/2 minutes is up.
Sorry about that, J-Bird.
It's never business,
it's aIways pIeasure.
It's cooI, Jimmy.
Did you see this motherfucker?
No, no, no.
Fuck it.
-Hey, Jimmy, Iook.
-Yeah, baby?
Just hear me out
on this one.
Pass up the money train
and jump his ass on the bus.
His Ioss.
Hear me out on this.
Don't need nothing Iike that.
We cooI.
Drop the piece, homeboy.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Drop the piece, nigger!
Eddie Mack! Come on, baby!
Lupovich, baby, just be cooI.
Everybody just be cooI.
Baby, be cooI.
Be cooI, man.
Jimmy, man, just hear it out.
Just hear out the deaI.
I don't need to hear no deaI.
I don't need no new partners...
I don't need no new product...
and I damn sure don't need
this cracker's...
Saturday night speciaI
in my face.
Just try it. That's aII.
You heard the man.
Try it.
AII right, baby, that's good.
Heat it up!
Like that, Jimmy?
Just Iet it kick in, baby.
Gonna be nice, Jimmy.
Oh, my God!
God damn it!
Don't fucking move!
My one good suit!
God damn it!
TeII her to shut up!
Get your punk ass

TeII that bitch
to stop screaming!
Stop fucking screaming!
You hear me?
What fuck are we gonna do now?
Shut up and Iet me think!
I need this Iike I fucking
need a hoIe in my head.
I am not the onIy one
in this room...
with that nigger's bIood
on my hands.
Get his knife.
Everybody Ieaves a print.
We hang together,
or we hang separateIy.
Now cut him and cut him good.
What it is, homeboy.
What it wiII be, nigger.
Now you.
Hey! Now you!
J-Bird, heIp me, brother.
I'm sorry, brother.
Since we was grasshoppers.
Like you said.
Every man for himseIf, baby.
Hey, Shaft, it's your turn.
Hey, don't even think about it.
Man, hurry up!
OK, mama, it's your turn.

Either you cut him...
or die with him.
I Iove you.

Take this and bury it with him.
Come on, move!
Get him out of here.
Bet you wish

He was your father.
You have his eyes.

-I was trying to protect you.
-From what?
Why did you give a shit

Why did you care that we were

Patrick.
BuIIshit.
Look, don't Iie to me, Pop.
Come on.
For once, teII me the truth.
Look, I saw your face.
Now, you knew that pIace,

We have to save him.
Save who?
Can Jeremiah come out and pIay?

And it wiII be your ass.

-We're coming with you.
-No, you're not.
You gotta stay with Mom !
Jesus fucking Christ,

Shut the fuck up.
You two bitches were just meat.
You never had any idea smarter
than getting yourseIves...
a IittIe bit more.
But my brother J-Bird, here,
this nigger was smart.
He didn't just want more.
He wanted more
with compound interest.
Come on, Jimmy. PIease, man.
-Get Lou.
-Get him.
Get that fucker.
Bye, Loopy Lou!
-It's the bIood.
-What, Mama?
Remember when I toId you
that a person...
has more than two parts,
they have three?
Body, souI, and spirit?
The spirit
Iives in the bIood...
and the spirit keeps
the body and souI together...
and sometimes
the spirit Iives on.
Jimmy's bIood
must stiII be in that buiIding.
Let's go.
Look here, Jimmy.
I got $20,000 saved up, buried.
Don't nobody know
where it is but me.
You can have haIf of it.
AII right.
You can have it aII, man.
Come on, man.
I reaIIy don't--
Jimmy! Jimmy!
Come on, man, Jimmy!
And now, J-Bird, my brother...
it's time for you
to coIIect your interest.
This is it.
We found that skeIeton
right down here.
AII right, it was here.
Right here!
-What'd he have on?
-Nothin'.
No, wait,
there was a green rag.
My god, my dress.
My bIoody dress.
We gotta burn it.
We gotta cIose the door.
Find my dress!
The bIood on the dress
is keeping him aIive!
-I couIdn't find anything!
-Look for it!
You was my main man.
Since we was grasshoppers.
I aIways Iooked after you.
You had a piece
of everything I had.
I didn't want
a piece of yours, Jimmy.
I wanted my own.
And fuck everybody eIse, huh?
God damn, Jimmy!
Think about it, Jimmy.
If it had happened to you...
you wouId've done
the same goddamn thing, man.
Nah, brother.
I wouIdn't have done
any manner of what you did.
It's a trip, ain't it?
Oh, my God.
Are you aII right?
-Baby, you OK?
-She's aII right.
-Be carefuI!
-Oh, heII, no!
BiII, sIow down! Be carefuI.
Don't get hurt. Be carefuI.
Oh, shit.
Watch your step.
Stay back.
Come back!
Find Jeremiah!
Mama, come back!
TeII me, Jimmy.
What wiII it take, huh?
What do you want?
Just teII me, Jimmy!
Oh, man, that's easy.
Think you can give me
my Iife back?
Can you swing that, brother?
You know I can't do that!
You're fuckin' dead!
Dog eat dog, brother.
Dog eat dog.
-We can cIimb out.
-Where?
Anywhere but here.
Come on, man. Let's go.
Turn around, baby.
You know I aIways Ioved you
in this dress.
Oh, damn.
Come on, give me your hand.
Look out. You cooI?
AII right.
Did he create aII this?
No, but he's a part of it.
This is...
the city of the dead.
We just have to remember
what was here and foIIow it.
Those stairs shouId take us
to the second fIoor.
Didn't I teII you, baby?
Didn't I teII you I'd be
strokin' your neck tonight?
I took out my revenge
'cause I had to.
Now stay here with me--
forever.
OK, where do we go now?
Oh, not now.
Come on!
Oh, my God.
Bro, where you goin'?
-Maurice, where you goin'?
-BiII, wait!
That's not Maurice.
Where you goin', man?
Where the heII you at?
He's gone.
This way.

We gotta go now!
Run! Come on! Let's go!
PIease!
Come on! Run, Cyn, run!
-AII right, we have to jump!
-I can't!
We have to! Now!
Cyn! Come on!
Come on! Jump! Hurry up!
Are you aII right?
Come on, baby, we gotta go!
Come on! Go, go, go!
Oh, shit! Go!
Dog eat dog, boy.
Dog eat dog.
