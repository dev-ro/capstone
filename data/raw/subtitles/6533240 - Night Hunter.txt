Police are making
a plea for information
for 24-year-old student,
Alison Woods.
My daughter, Sarah Collins,
vanished nine days ago.
Emily Phillips was last
seen leaving her gym
on the corner of Washington...
She may have met someone online.
I know she's out
there somewhere.
We're praying for the day you...
- Still, we have to find a body.
- We miss you.
We love you,
we are not giving up.
You don't tell me what
to do in this house.
This is my house.
These are my rules!
You're not speaking 'cause
you went through my stuff!
How many times have I asked
you to use the doorbell?
I'll be ready in a minute, Dad.
Mom snooped through
my social media.
You have no right to do that.
I have every right to do
that, young lady.
You should've asked her first.
See?
Would you like to see the photos
your daughter's posting of herself?
Or the conversations
she's having
with complete and
total strangers?
It's nothing compared to the
naked selfies Kim and Kylie post.
I'm sorry, Dad,
I'll take it down.
- Ready for school?
- Sit down.
Show me these people
you've been talking to.
You mean boys?
You can talk to boys.
Boys are gonna try
and talk to you.
I didn't accept their
friend requests.
Some of them
messaged me, though.
And you replied?
They were being so annoying.
They were baiting you.
And you fell for it.
Assess the situation like I taught
you how to do in the real world.
Malcolm here.
All of his photos are by himself.
And look at his camera angles.
He's trying to make it look like
someone else is
taking the picture.
And all of his friends are girls.
Do you get his M.O. now?
Men are...
Pigs.
I know.
Can we go to school now?
Yeah, get your stuff.
Think of it like a...
a roller coaster.
You'll be...
nervous to start with.
Even scared a little.
But once you get started...
the rush...
Thanks for my phone,
by the way.
That's a secret phone, remember.
So why don't we start by...
each taking off a
piece of our clothes.
Sexy.
Really?
No, dickhead.
The driver found her when
he unloaded the cargo.
Female Caucasian, 30s.
Has multiple breaks,
left arm, both legs.
Jumper?
I'd say so.
She didn't die on impact
but given her injuries and the
temperature shortly after...
I'd estimate she landed from
a height of over 50 feet.
Ask the driver if
he stopped for gas.
And check the bridges
along his route.
Might have CCTV or
security cameras.
She had major cartilage
damage on her wrists
and calcified
bruising on the bone.
She was tied up.
Looks like it.
She was also given vitamin
supplements and birth control.
Whoever did this
blew her eardrums out.
But her cranium was still intact.
The lab thinks it's some
kind of pressurized device.
Have you ID'd her yet?
No.
Whoever did this
took a lot of...
patience and dedication and, uh...
if we're lucky,
it's a lone case of infatuation.
Yeah, and if we're not,
it's a guy who wants his guests
to be permanent residents.
Hey! My gosh.
How are you?
Okay.
Um...
So, I'm guessing
you work cyber now.
I gave up the lounge chair.
I'm a profiler now.
I guide their interactions...
I can't get into this interface.
It's not working.
Just grab his code
trail, lock on to it.
It's a really delicate
gig, you know.
Trying to coerce someone
into revealing an agenda
without pushing them into one.
Um, Rachel...
Pardon, sorry.
- Your, uh, boy's back.
- Okay.
All right.
Look, listen, I need, uh,
some people checked out,
my daughter's social media.
Oh, that's good,
you're in touch.
That's really good.
And Angie, how is she?
Just... what I asked for.
Thank you.
He seems nice.
The fuck is this?
Who are you?
Listen, I... I haven't done
anything wrong.
94 girls groomed.
Looks like you met with
13 of them, had sex with four.
Is wrong or what?
I never...
I never forced any of them.
There's little difference between
forcing yourself on someone
and influencing a
girl into submission.
What the fuck?
I can't feel my...
$92,000 in savings,
another $8,000 in stocks.
I'll get... I'll get help.
I'll... I'll go to therapy.
Oh, you don't need that anymore.
Doesn't work anyway.
It's highlighted by
your previous conviction
Jesus fucking Christ!
What have you done to me?
Sign this.
Your savings will be divided
amongst the girls you abused.
Take one twice a day
for the rest of your life.
It's a testosterone suppressant.
Your doctor will
prescribe it for you.
What's happening to me?
I've disarmed you.
It's still there, but it's now...
no longer possible for
you to get an erection.
I've also had
your balls removed,
not that you had any...
in the first place.
If you inform the police
of your rehabilitation,
I will release the images
you have poorly hidden
on your computer to your
entire address book.
Do I make myself clear?
Why this one?
It's isolated.
It's a long way on foot
in the cold from either side.
She was being chased.
Jumping is the only option.
I won't get much off this.
It should still be hot.
Oh, you got the bread I like.
When are you gonna get some
proper furniture for this place?
You want somewhere nice
to sit, I'll get you a sofa.
No, I meant for you, I mean,
there's just sheets
over everything, I mean,
it's just weird, you know,
it's a house, you sit down...
These are for you.
Oh, these are nice.
There's a transmitter in them.
Okay, not so nice.
They emit a signal that
feeds off cell phones.
As long as you're near one,
I'll be able to track you.
Do you have to use that one?
I look so rough.
Hey, you wanna help me
a second with this, I got...
Where's my file?
- Ah, Rachel took it.
- Rachel...
- Rachel has a way of...
- She wanted to go over it,
a little personal touch.
Yeah.
And where is she?
She's at lunch.
At lunch?
Yeah, she eats.
Is that your baby?
Yeah.
You bring your baby to work?
When my girl can't have her...
yes.
And what...
Fuck it.
You coulda said something.
What was I supposed to do?
You coulda said something.
Didn't you move in,
like, a year ago?
No wonder you wouldn't
let me come over.
Yeah.
And it works for me.
No one says it has to be pretty.
Mom does.
I do what I do.
You do what you do.
I do pizza.
Told you you don't
wanna spend time here.
Don't you want
a proper home again?
I just want a shower
and get back to work.
He ain't comin'
I'm bored, I wanna go home.
Come get me.
Okay, now, I'm actually
ready to leave.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
So, you're been here a while.
Where's your pa?
In jail.
You know,
you should stand up straight.
You got some great, hefty tits,
show 'em off.
There was a young girl in here.
That foul-mouthed little thing?
That'd be her.
She left already.
Are you all right?
Are you okay?
- Move your car!
- Are you hurt?
Get out of the way!
Move your car!
You're in shock!
- Move your fucking car!
- You're in shock!
It's okay!
Help!
Somebody help!
Police!
Police!
He pushed me aside.
Must be drunk or somethin'.
Sir, out of the vehicle, please.
He is running hundreds
of open profiles.
It's all wired to
upgrade automatically
but he's barely using
half of its capabilities.
If anything,
he's a self-taught techie.
Why do I recognize him?
He was a judge,
and a good one.
He handled a lot of
our criminal cases.
And he stepped down
when his family was murdered.
My colleagues have some
questions about the
equipment in your car.
There's a young girl out there...
- being abducted.
- Yes.
He says that he's fitted
a girl with a tracker.
And he's using her as bait.
The signal went dead
right about here.
It's moving, we lost it.
Her very life is on the line!
Right now! Right this second!
And here we are, talking!
Mr. Cooper.
Get out there and find her!
Your tracker, how does it work?
Cell phones.
We have confirmation
of cell phone signals
running through the drones.
Copy that.
3 Charlie 119, two minutes
outside Hudson's bridge.
10-4, will maintain UAV
clearance until then.
Drones are up.
The tracker signal's loading.
Relaying signal

Trauma to the structural tissue
surrounding your eardrum.
Can you hear me?
Good.
I'll come back
later for your MRI.
Julie?
Do you remember how long
you're in captivity?
Did you know him?
Do you remember seeing
any of the other girls?
I'm so sorry that I have
to ask you these questions.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
He didn't touch me.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
Do you have a second?
Fuck you, dude.
You two need to have a serious
think about what you're doing.
What we're doing?
'Cause I'm pretty sure we're
the ones that caught him.
Let's go home.
Cops are fucking useless.
You only show up after
it's already happened.
Simon Stulls.
Is your name Simon Stulls?
Simon Stulls.
For the record,
anything you say or do
can and will be held against
you in a court of law.
Would you like the State to
provide you with an attorney?
Pleas say the word "no"
if you're declining the
use of a State attorney.
No.
Born 1987.
Sole proprietor
of 42 Maggie Lane.
Pressurized air valve.
Custom made and all.
That's why there wasn't
any damage to the cranium.
The rush of air
damages soft tissue, not bone.
He's very, very
comfortable in there.
Yeah.
You caused a lot of
people a lot of pain,
and the best thing
you can do now
is help us.
This is how he
made them all deaf.
You asked to be in here.
And I asked
for you not to be.
Simon...
You're scared of it?
Can you hear me?
You can't hear me, can you?
Please send me home.
I love me so much.
So, so much.
So, so much.
So, so much.
So, so much.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah Collins!
- Sarah!
- Shh. Hey, hey.
You can't be like this in here.
They said they found some alive.
I'll have this officer
to help you over here.
- Sarah Collins.
- He's gonna help you.
- She went missing...
- Sir?
He'll look after you.
She went missing four years ago.
Dad!
He's stared at himself for
three hours without moving.
It's called guilt.
I can't get a read on him.
He's impaired but it's
more social than physical.
It's akin to...
childhood disintegrative
disorder.
You want the good news
or the bad news?
Bad.
They found a lot of
unidentified DNA in that house.
So it's your job to
get inside his head...
and find out what he's done.
A lot of families in need
of closure out there.
And the good news?
Well, he's shit scared of me.
So, I'm gonna
go home and eat.
And probably fuckin'
sleep for a week.
Suddenly, I'm jealous.
I don't wanna be here
or at home.
Lay next to me, Dad.
I don't sleep so good.
Wait till I fall asleep.
What were you like
when you were my age?
Trouble.
Your Uncle Charlie and
I used to ride bikes
up and down
the beach all day.
We would fall asleep in the sand.
Not wake up until the
middle of the night.
Your Grandma
would be so angry.
So much trouble.
What...?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!
What the fuck else
is out there?!
What the fuck else
is out there?!
Stop it!
Stop it!
He rigged the fucking basement!
What?
He killed six fucking cops!
That's what!
Fucking piece of shit!
Get out! Get out!
Simon.
Creeper!
It's fine, it's okay.
- I don't want this.
- Simon.
This is not a game.
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
What?
Let's play a game.
'Cause you all look the same.
- Creeper. Creeper!
- It's okay!
It's fine.
It's okay. You're doing
so well, keep going.
Our dad is burning
me in the woods.
Teach me how to play the game.
Freezing hot.
Burning cold.
Play because clothes burn.
Clothes burn.
You wrap them up,
and you try to get away.
And you try to get away,
but you can never get away.
You can never get away.
- Cannot get away.
- That was great.
Then when they bark down
in a cage like a doggie.
Then they go woof
and they go woof!
And they go woof,
and they try to bite you.
And they try to scratch at you.
And they kick at you,
and they kick at you,
and they kick at you.
He was either playful or angry.
Never both.
Excited like a child or...
mean.
Don't let him fool you.
That man is evil.
Police have suffered six fatalities
while searching the premises of
a white male in his 30s
who is believed to
have several women
locked up in his basement.
Survivors are being treated
at the local hospital.
Reporting live from
Minnesota, KL News.
Hey, figured
you might be in here.
The press is outside,
they want a statement.
You got a pen?
Yeah.
No comment.
Right.
Today I'd like to talk about
the money that we
found in your house.
You only have one bank account
but it rarely shows
any withdrawals.
Where did you get the money?
Simon.
Do you know where
you got the money?
Finders keepers losers bleepers.
Where did you get the money?
In a trunk.
Outside the front door, s'mores.
There's bug in my ear.
Someone brings you money?
♪ Riding through the snow ♪
Simon, who brings you money?
Santa Claus.
He comes at night
when I'm asleep
and then he rushes off... whoosh!
Ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho! Ho!
Simon.
Tell me about your mother.
Dead.
Mommy dead.
Mm.
Mommy is... dead.
She didn't love me.
No, she did love me.
She did love me
Did she hurt you?
No!
Okay, okay. Come here.
I've seen enough of this shit.
What?
I want him in court today.
But there are elements of
paranoid schizophrenia.
I genuinely don't care.
I'm just getting through to him.
We do not have to try to
make sense of this thing.
I want him outta here.
He's like bad fuckin' milk
sittin' in the fridge.
Court. Sentenced. Jail.
Got it?
I need more time.
He has multi-personality traits,
each with their own realities,
but I don't know how
many he's created
or if he's even aware of them.
I think he's fucking with us.
Come on, man,
we've had the longest week,
we've had the longest day.
How else can someone like this...
do what he's done...
in such a long time...
and never get caught?
Shake the tree.
Arrest every fucking
thing that falls.
Yes, sir.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Good talk.
It's not him. He's getting help.
I do not agree.
He is more than capable of
planning for the eventuality...
He's a fucking idiot!
The one that you've seen, yes,
but there's more than
one of him in there.
That's the point.
I have his mother’s case file.
Amy Stulls, born 1962,
committed suicide 1995.
You're chasing ghosts.
While working overtime
in the textile factory,
the mother was abducted
and raped in 1986.
Tossed into a lake.
She survived to become
pregnant with Simon.
What's the address
of that textile factory?
Okay.
They found a suicide note.
Zoom in.
"Rejoice. Rejoice."
"Judas' whore is dead.
"Come serpents, feed on my feet.
"The fire, the ice.
"The creeper who raped me.
"His blood money
I let silence me.
"Shame on you all.
"Shame.
"I hate you.
"I love you.
"I tried to hide us...
"but the devil sees everything.
"My evil, evil boy.
"My sweet, sweet boy.
"Mommy's so sorry.
"This winterbug is free."
So, like, will it hurt?
No.
Don't be silly.
Where's Cooper?
Hey, man.
Oh, fucking ballsacks.
I-I was-I was just...
being a friend.
I need Cooper.
He can hear you.
I-I'm sorry, okay?
I-I just wanna go.
Put those on,
or I will let them...
castrate you.
I'm not surprised by
what you're up against.
Predators may...
act in solitary,
but their instincts
are quite the opposite.
They take comfort in knowing
that there're others out there,
just like them all alone.
Please continue to enlighten
me on the nature of criminals.
That is the reason
your men are dying, isn't it?
Simon's got friends.
Hi.
What are you cunts doing here?
That is not nice.
For the record...
I have no legal right or claim
over anything on this property.
You guys are here illegally
and now anything you
find on that computer
is inadmissible in a court of law.
Shit.
Yeah, fucktards.
Hey, what's he doing, anyway?
I'm hacking
Simon's virtual drive
from what it thinks
is a trusted source
due to the exchange.
Why are you helping him?
Because he never
tried to fuck me
and wouldn't, if he could.
He's decent.
Most men are fucking gross.
Not all men are gross.
Oh, yours isn't?
No, mine is.
I'm in.
Who are you?
How many cases have
you worked where
guilt is obvious but the jury
had to ignore a piece of evidence?
Like a rapist who...
buys his way out of a case.
Suddenly, someone has
the courage to refuse
his offer to pay her off.
Prosecutes.
Jury will never hear
what he's done before.
Doesn't really give
you the right to
run around hacking people's
nuts off, though, does it?
If a lion eats someone,
and you lock it up
and you say,
"Don't do that again",
then ten years later,
you let it out, what happens?
Not all criminals are animals.
Some are wired to be.
80% of sex offenders
reoffend. 80%.
Yet we knowingly
let them back out
onto the street.
Seven this last month released
within 15 miles of this school.
That's five out of seven
active predators.
Unless you treat the
underlying cause of their
instinct to offend: hormones.
When you do that...
reoffend rate drops
to just five percent.
You can't think that
someone's gonna commit a crime
regardless of any of
the social factors
because that is
dangerously narrow-minded.
It's like thinking all
Muslims are terrorists.
I'm not talking about the
color of a man's skin.
I'm talking about...
the endless voice
in a predator's head
that says,
"do it, do it, do it."
You're too stubborn to ask why.
I know why.
You think you got punished
for letting all those sex
offenders out of prison.
What happened to your family...
was a tragedy.
And no matter how many
predators you treat...
that guilt you're feeling...
it never goes away.
We hacked his server, he was
talking to someone called Hunter.
Hunter71.
The explosive in the car was
pentaerythritol tetranitrate
Commonly used, however,
the compounds and the
trigger are unique.
High intensity, stable,
low-surrounding impact and dense.
Expensive. Military-grade.
Simon said that
Santa comes and drops
money off the house.
I figure maybe "Santa"
pays the bomb maker.
Run a search for military
personnel in the state...
born 1971.
Okay, which one of those
are trained in explosives?
No longer in service.
Team, shots fired!
Officer down!
I'm laying out cover!
All forward now!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Turn around!
Stay back! Stay back!
Wait!
We both know why you're here.
You sold a triggered explosive
to a man who abducted and
killed more than ten women.
What?
Don't you read the
fucking newspaper?
What else did you make him?
Uh...
Signal blocker for cell phones.
It's not...
That was the guy who
locked up all those women?
Yeah.
Someone out there...
Tell me about your mommy.
Tell me about her.
I bet she hated you.
She loved me,
she protected me.
Protected you from what?
She didn't take care of you.
She didn't love you.
- Yeah.
- No one loves you.
No one.
You have nobody.
- You have nobody
- No.
to keep you company.
No.
Where's the other Simon?
I wanna talk to him.
Where is he?
- Rachel, no.
- Come on.
Come on.
What is it? You like tits?
- No.
- You like to chain women up?
Yes, you do, come on.
- Come on, Simon. Come on!
- Don't do that.
What did she do to you?
Come on!
- Tell me what she did to you.
- No.
- Tell me. What?
- Rachel, no.
- No! No!
- What did she do to you?
Tell me! Come on!
She never let me play!
She always kept me up
locked in a cage
like a monkey.
Like a monkey!
What did you do to her?
What did you do to your mom?
They made me.
- They told me to.
- Who's they?
- They told me to.
- Who's they?
The told me to.
Who's they?
Come on!
Who's they? Who's they?
The voices in your head?
Tell me who it is.
I wanna talk to the other Simon.
I wanna talk to the man.
I am the man!
I do what I want!
Do you remember all the
women that you killed?
I remember them.
I remember them.
Who was the first one?
Why?!
I hate him.
He follows me everywhere!
This arrived for you upstairs.
I signed for it.
You know, give you a break.
Thank you.
Are you okay?
Yeah, it's just been a long day.
So, you wanna go
get some ribs?
Hey, baby,
I'm ready to take her.
Baby?
Are you sleeping?
Hey.
Hey.
Marshall?
Everyone! Get out!
You know,
I have to yell at people
to get them to do what I want.
You don't.
What are you doing here?
It's freezing cold and
it's middle of the night.
You don't...
Well, I know you
don't want to be here.
I despise down time.
My wife used to chastise me
because I never took any, so...
It just doesn't
feel right to put
my feet up
where hers should be.
You know what I mean?
I'm used to seeing you
look like shit,
you look like... almost normal.
What's goin' on?
I'm just...
You know.
Bomb threat at the police station.
Everyone evac.
I repeat. Everyone evac.
Let's go, let's go!
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
we gotta go, come on!
Put this shit on.
Put it on!
I got you. I got you!
I got you.
- Shut up!
- I got you.
Rachel.
Where is he?
In his cell.
That package was from you.
He's not gonna blow himself up.
This is bullshit.
Why wouldn't he?
'Cause then the game is over.

Since when do you cook?
I used to cook for your
mother all the time.
I just haven't had a reason to.
I mean, do you...
do your hair all nice when there's
no one there to look at it?
Yes.
It's a bad example.
This is gluten free, right?
'Cause I'm gluten intolerant.
No, you're not.
What's going on?
When your mother
and I had you,
she was very nervous
about my job.
SWAT is dangerous.
So I moved to Homicide,
where it's quieter.
But with you around,
everything became personal.
Where I couldn't
afford it to be.
I tried everything.
Even therapy.
Could you imagine me in therapy?
You hate talking.
So, you were worried something
bad would happen to me?
No... actually...
I just couldn't...
I couldn't see anymore.
You know, when you're

and the lights are off...
you can see the room, right?
And if you turn the lights on
and off again...
you can't see anything.
The people I chase...
they live in the dark.
And I can see them really easily
until you came along.
Because...
you're the light.
No phones or laptops
till you come get us.
I get it. It's okay, Dad.
Be careful.
Simon's mother was suicidal.
After the rape and pregnancy,
she must've seen a psychiatrist.
That doesn't matter.
All the files of the rape
charge has been buried.
Not these. The state has
strict indemnity clauses
to protect itself in the event
that a patient commits suicide.
Records at crisis
centers across the state
get backed up annually.
Simon wouldn't know that.
Nobody would.
Waste of fucking time.
It's Marshall. I need two teams
down at the Psychiatric
Records Center.
There is a corridor filled
with crap down here.
Got it!
Okay, hold on that.
You wanna meet his mother?
Amy Stulls. AXOP-392.
So... you look good.
You sleeping?
Better than ever.
And eating?
Always.
You're still refusing
an ultrasound.
The doctors are there
to help you, you know.
Look it.
I started getting
nice things already.
I see, you bought those
with the money you got
from the settlement?
Do you really think,
given what he did to you,
he's gonna leave you
and the baby alone?
Well, everyone else thinks
he's such a nice man.
She knew him.
We find his dad,
we'll find Simon.
And if he comes
knocking on that door,
wanting to meet his kid.
Judas sinned and was forgiven.
We found mother's
file in the archives,
1976, Amy Stulls.
Rape and attempted murder.
Settled out of court
for $1.14 million,
but the payee's
name is not listed.
Good work.
Can you make it
down to the station?
I'll do my best.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Well, he's covered
his tracks well.
Yup.
His father's name isn't on
any of he criminal reports
and I can't find any sign
of him on the database.
If the Commissioner had
given me the fucking time
that I needed with Simon
instead of fucking yelling at me...
then maybe we'd have a
clue where he is right now.
Will your professional opinion
be worded that way
in your report?
Look, we know he knew her
and he paid her off.
If he didn't own
the textile company,
see who owns the building.
Patching it through.
MCG Industries.
textile and supply distributor.
founded by David McGovern.
Recently cited in a car accident
with one Michael Cooper.
I didn't see you!
Are you hurt?
You're in shock! I-It's okay.
McGovern's also serving as
chairman of the
board of benefactors
to Flexton Prep
where he currently
resides on campus.
Guys, guys, guys.
Folks, with me, come on.
Guys, with me.
No! Why?
What's wrong with him?
You will die!
You are gonna die!
- I hate you!
- Drop the knife, Simon!
Drop the fucking knife!
I want my bear.
Please, my bear.
Creep, creep, creeper.
I want my bear!
You're his father?
I want my bear.
Please, my bear.
I want my bear.
Simon, why did you do this?
I hate him, he wouldn't
leave me alone!
He's my bear.
I want my bear.
My bear.
I want my bear!
Mommy, bear.
Just give him the fucking bear,
you cunting bitch.
Look what he made me do.
No more crying like
a fucking baby.
You wanna know what
I did to those sluts?
There's a busload of them
you don't know about.
Give me what he wants.
His bear.
If you can.. hear him...
crying like a fucking baby.
I can't listen to him anymore.
Shut him up.
No bear...
no bodies.
Nothing but twiddling
that tight little...
I give you this...
you give me everything.
Samantha Crawley.
Deceased?
Katherine Titus.
No?
Allison Woods.
Deceased?
Rebecca Chastain.
Lara?
Deceased?
Emily Richardson.
Rachel Prudhome.
Victoria Maringoff.
Emily Phillips.
No.
He's been in my fucking house.
What the fuck are
you all doing here?
That's impossible. He's been
here since yesterday afternoon.
Just take a beat an calm down.
- I will not!
- Cooper.
Look, can I remind you,
the only reason
that you haven't
been arrested...
'Cause you're too busy
being dicked around!
Cooper!
You know I have nothing to lose.
You find her.
You find my girl unharmed.
Or I'm not responsible
for what happens next.
Where is Lara?
Let me say I'm sorry...
and then I'll tell you.
Apology accepted.
Not to you, silly bean.
To them outside.
Let me say sorry for
the things I've done...
and then I'll tell you
where the last one is.
Is she alive?
Yes.
But tick tock...
tick tock...
tick tock...
tick tock...
tick tock...
Who's the clever boo-boo?
We can't take the chance
of losing another girl.
There's no way this ends well.
Of course there fucking isn't.
Please, please!
Please.
Just say you're sorry.
Anything else...
and you'll be begging
for the death penalty.
I wanted to say...
Hey, did you take my wife?
Hey, look at the picture, man!
Did you take her?
No, I did not.
She's way too ugly.
The reason I didn't get caught
is because the police
and all of you
are dumber than the
sluts that I fucked.
Son of a bitch!
They're gonna try and lynch
you here and at the courthouse.
So get their attention
then bug out.
I'm going.
Absolutely not.
Lara's still out there
and he won't talk to you.
Okay, fine. Be careful.
2010 exiting Crossland.
1015 on Andover Street.
Where has he put Lara?
Where is she?
Where's Lara?
Pause 217.
Put 'em together in set screen.
Why do you stay
with your husband
when you know he
fucks other women?
How did you know that?
Shit!
Fuck this!
Come on, you sick...
Come here.
Where is she?
Where is she?
Tell me, damn you!
Tell me!
Where is my Lara?
Damn you!
My Lara!
Where the fuck is she?
Where is my Lara?
Where the fuck is she?
Tell me.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Kiss.
Take that fucking shit off.
Is that Rachel?
Rachel's in there!
You get the young one,
I got Rachel!
Rachel likes me.
Hi, Rachel!
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck!
What do you got?
There's two of...
Yeah, I know. What else?
He said... he said he's
got the younger one.
Grab...
Grab your winterbug.
See who gets out.
They must've switched
at the school.
They were both there.
And we only got one of them.
All right, think forward,
not back.
So, where is he taking them?
Add "winterbug" to the keywords.

Hey, hey.

No. Next.
Winterbug.
Pagan and animal sacrifice

Wasn't the mother
thrown into a lake?
Mm, the location wasn't
listed in the police report.
Bring up the Amy Stulls
interview, two minutes in.
It felt good to kill
Daddy, didn't it?
Yes, I liked it,
I liked it a lot.
And if it feels good, it's okay.
Remember?
Mommy will be happy
not following me around anymore
like a sneak, sneak, sneaker.
Daddy just wanted
to be your friend.
Like he was with me.
The police all thought
that he was trying to save you.
Yeah!
But really, it was me.
Me, it was me.
'Cause I love you.
I love me.
No one else loves you.
Only me, silly bean.
I want Rachel.
I'll have Rachel.
'Cause uh, she likes me.
She likes me.
Now, I have a life
inside of me.
And it is my purpose
to keep it safe...
and alive...
and far from the devil's gaze.
Time to play winterbug,

Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, hey, hey, hey!

Wait! Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Oh, my...
- Yeah?
- Oh, my God.
Come here, come here.
Okay?
Stay here.
No fucking way.
There's no safety on that.
Wait, wait, we have to tell
Cooper that I'm okay.
He's gonna be worried.
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.
- Look at me.
- Oh, my God!
Look at me, look at me.
I know it doesn't feel
like it right now,
but you're gonna be okay.
I promise you.
Okay?
Okay.
He told me
what you did to him.
You wanna see the man?
You wanna see the man?
Ah! You fucking bitch!
I want me!
I want me!
I-I want me!
I want me!
I want me!
Let him go!
Let him go!
I want me.
I want me.
Let him go or I'll fucking
kill her right now!
Can't hear you.
Fucking bitch.
Get up there, you fucking bitch.
Don't you fucking hurt him.
I will fucking kill her.
I can't hear you.
You're gonna have to come closer.
- Come on.
- Don't you touch him.
Don't you fucking touch him!
I will fucking kill her!
I will fucking kill her.
Don't you hurt him.
Don't you touch him.
Let him go!
Do you see what happens?
Enough!
Do you see what happens?
Okay! Enough!
Enough!
I will stick this gun
right up her fucking cunt
and shoot her.
If we go through this ice,
we are dead in 60 seconds.
She'll fall right
through the fuckin' ice!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
You think I fucking
care if I die?
No!
You care if he dies, don't you?
I will fucking...
I will fucking kill you.
Think of everything you've
done to get him out.
You can have him, too.
Just let her go.
No!
Rachel... go.
Keep that pointed over here!
Keep that pointed here!
Go!
Fuck!
I want me.
I want me.
I want me.

Yes.
Yes.
Okay, come here.
Go give him a big hug.
Come here!
Come here.
Fuck you!
Lara,
I write this
in the event of my death.
And I've left instructions within.
Although you allowed
me to be your guardian,
know that you were also mine.
Your light...
saved me.
Now, shine.
Hey. Oh, yeah,
we're not doing that.
You said anything I wanted.
Who are you?
I'm Rachel,
I work with your dad.
You must be Faye.
Are you married?
Currently, yes.
Faye, Rachel saved my life.
So?
