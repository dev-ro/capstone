I want something that
says I'm sorry he's dead,
but not that sorry.
He was just a dog,
and you shouldn't have
loved him more than me.
Can you do me a bunch
that says that?
Rachel, darling,
tell your father he
can't wear that suit.
He looks nice.
You look nice.
Thank you, puppet.
I've seen better-dressed crab.
I have a question. Oh,
God, would somebody please
put a gag on my daughter?
Why's the alphabet
in that order?
Nobody knows. Nobody cares.
For once in your life
would you just...
What do you think?
Holy wow.
Oh, darling.
You look like meringue.
Good.
You're late.
Balls. What's the job?
Wedding. You always pull.
One of us has to. Nice people?
Haven't met them. All
about the mother.
Isn't it always?
Come out with us first? Sure.
You will? Absolutely.
Oh, cool.
Well, we'll go together.
I'll meet you there.
You're not coming.
My favorite advert's on TV.
You need a love life.
I have a like life.
It suits me fine.
No, I feel good, actually.
Bizarrely good, yeah, yeah.
No nerves at all.
None whatsoever. Thanks.
Thank you very much. Hi.
Thank you. Hi.
You're Hector, right? The groom?
Yeah, yeah, I am. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Call me Heck.
Um, well, I did your flowers.
Oh, did you? Oh, well,
then, then fabulous.
Aren't they, Coop?
Fabulous, yeah.
I wouldn't know a nice flower
from a poke in the eye.
But they're fabulous,
aren't they, Coop?
So, Ned, how long have you
guys been married, then?
30 years. Oh.
If I had killed her
when I first thought about it,
I could be out by now.
A free man.
I remember all the
way to the church,
I just wanted to shout
"Stop the car!"
This is a horrible mistake!"
But I mean, you can't, can you?
So you just sit there,
say nothing,
as the wheels keep turning,
leading you on to the
longest sentence...
Stop the car!
I forgot to pee.
All right, panic over.
They're here now.
Good luck, chum.
All right, is it?
You're all right.
Hi, Heck. Hi, babe.
You want some help with this?
Yes.
I do work out, yes.
I don't have a six-pack.
No?
No, a 12-pack on this puppy.
I don't really like
men with muscles.
The bonus is, though,
I'm very, uh...
I'm very sensitive, too.
Heck, I've got a question.
Not now.
What's the question?
What happens when an
unstoppable force
meets an immovable object?
I haven't got a blasted clue.
There you are, you see? Now we can
let them get married in peace.
Uh, it never happens.
If there's a thing
that can't be stopped,
it's not possible for there
to be something else
which can't be moved,
and vice versa.
They can't both exist.
You see, it's a trick question.
That's the answer.
Can she sit with me?
What am I doing in here?
When do fish sleep?
She's coming, right? Isn't she?
She's coming.
Oh, she is. Yeah.
When, when's she coming?
What's your name, anyway?
Everyone calls me H.
They tell me it's
short for Henrietta,
but it's not.
It's short for Jesus H. Christ.
That's what my mummy said
when she found out she
was pregnant with me.
Isn't Heck handsome?
I fancy that flower girl.
Yeah, yeah, I know you did.
She likes me.
Right? I got, I got a
vibe that she likes me.
Coop, it's my wedding day.
Can we talk about me?
Sure.
Did you get a vibe
that she likes me?
Great.
Last one to the
altar, as they say.
Well, this is it.
Wish me luck.
Wish you luck?
It's a wedding.
Bridesmaids always
pull at weddings.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
All set.
Okay, you sort it.
I'm going to set
up the reception.
Excuse me.
All good?
Always.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here in the sight of God
and in the face of
this congregation...
You look beautiful.
To join together this man
and this woman in
holy matrimony.
Congratulations!

Hi.
Hi.
We-we haven't met.
I'm Luce.
Rachel.
I did your flowers.
You did?
My flowers are nice.
Anyway, I was just
going to get a...
drink.
I wouldn't.
Is there something wrong?
I'm here to help.
My ring.
I was getting some of
this punch crap and...
Your wedding ring?
It fell off.
Off and in there.
My wedding ring is in there.
And you tried the ladle?
Nothing.
And you can't empty it, no.
Stupid.
Um... right.
Only one thing to do.
Cover me. What?
Use the dress. I'm going in.
You can't... Oh,
clearly you can.
Mm. Hi.
They say white's the
color of virgins.
If I know Hector,
the only thing virgin around
here is the olive oil.
The old jokes really are
the best, aren't they?
I'm Rob. Hector works
underneath me,
but not in the biblical sense.
You're just like he described.
Now I need booze.
I've just met a cracking filly.
Thought I'd grease the
passage, so to speak.
Hi! Hi.
Um, this is Luce.
She's a florist.
My name's Rob.
But you can call me
anything you'd like.
And I'm sure I will.

He-Hello, everybody.
Uh, is this, is this
thing, is this thing on?
Cooper, there you are.
Get this buck off the microphone
and make a proper speech.
Unaccustomed...
What are you doing?
To public speak...
Anyway, um, these
guys are in love,
and I think that that's boring.
They've been in love for years.
Years!
Years that have seen endless
amounts of drugs consumed...
Ooh!
Yeah.
And meaningless sex,
thoroughly enjoyed by me.
They just stayed at
home as they do.
They've been like a married
couple for so many years,
it's a relief that
they're finally married.
So, before I do my
duty as best man,
and shag a bridesmaid...
You know who you are...
Um, I would like to raise a
glass to Rachel and Hector.
May they grow old together,
sharing the same pillow.
Rachel and Hector.
Rachel and Hector.
Oh, and, um,
now this is a very big deal.
Some say the reason it's taken
him this long to get married,
is his fear of making just this
speech, but he's making it now.
He's not sure he can do it.
I know he can do it.
Please put together
repeatedly, here's... Hecky!
Go on, Hector. Go on.
I know something
that helps, Hector.
Imagine everybody naked.
Hi, everyone.
I'm Heck.
And welcome to my wedding.
So I'm glad you're all
here looking at me,
because, um... because I want to
tell you how much I love Rachel.
What an amazing, wonderful,
uniquely fantastic
person she is.
Do you want to keep going?
No, no. I think
you're doing great.
Uh, okay, so this is me now.
I've been looking forward
to this day all my life,
and... I'm glad to share it
with so many people I love...
and a few people I've
never met before.
But I'm sure you're great, too.
I feel like I've known
Heck all my life,
and I know I'll know him
for the rest of it.
He's my best friend.
They say fairy tales
have happy endings,
even though the
passage can be rough.
But Heck and I were
mates and then lovers,
and it's been
smooth all the way.
Maybe that's a better
kind of fairy tale.
So a toast shmoast
won't do all that,
but if you could all
just wish us luck,
Heck and I would
appreciate it very much.
All righty?
One, two, three.
Good luck!
Hello.
Hi. You've got to help me.
I need a flower.
Just one. A good one!
The best. Okay.
This is my last chance.
My last chance flower.
Your last chance.
I really twated it up.
Only the right
flower can save me.
What about a rose? A red rose.
What would that say? Love.
Love's nice. That works.
And fidelity.
Not a red rose, then.
No, not a rose at all.
It's too obvious.
If this really is
your last chance,
we need to find you
something spectacular.
Be right with you.
That's fine.
Hi.
Hey.
How you doing? Good.
Great. I just...
What's out here?
Came by to say thanks.
It was a total pleasure.
Listen, sorry, I was
just dealing with...
Oh, God, of course.
Go right ahead.
What's your favorite flower?
I don't know.
I think I like lilies.
They're wrong.
How about this?
Bird-of-paradise.
Keep talking.
Real name strelitzia.
Named after Charlotte
of Strelitz.
She married King George
III, had 15 kids.
They never spent more
than an hour apart.
Okay, stop talking.
Do you want to come to dinner?
I'm sorry?
Dinner, with us, Heck and me.
I mean, you don't...
I'd love to.
Really?
This Friday?
Yeah, Friday, why not?
Great. I'll just
write down the...
Perfect!
This is the one.
My last chance flower.
Wish me luck. Good luck.
Next item: lot 48:
a 1930s American
oak mantle clock
here at 48 pounds.
I have 48 pounds.
Fifty.
The lady bid 50.
The lady bid 50.
Okay, baby, now
you've got to glare.
Give out the red eye.
I'd do it, but you're a
lot more frightening.
No, I'm not. Who
am I glaring at?
Anyone who wants that sofa.
They can't have it. It's mine.
Ours. Ours?
If it's under the
limit, 200 pounds.
I didn't know we need a limit.
I like limits. Otherwise,
you'll go mad.
Damn right I will.
That thing is mine.
Ours.
If it's under the limit.
75 pounds? 75?
I invited somebody to dinner,
Friday, that florist, Luce...
Lucy, whatever.
Oh, great, I'll cook.
Please, don't.
Moving right along.
Lot number nine...
Okay, baby, this is us.
This very attractive
leather sofa over there.
Brown leather Chesterfield.
Brass-style decoration
in slightly distressed
condition at 90 pounds.
I asked because...
This is my plan. Oh, no.
I thought we'd get Coop along.
Great idea. Excellent,
but it would be better
if you didn't do that.
90... Do I hear 90 pounds?
Not from us.
Come in late, psyche
them all the way out.
I think they'd be
perfect for each other.
Don't you think
they'd be perfect?
100, 100 pounds?
110, thank you.
Red eye, still the red eye.
Who? Luce and Cooper. I
think they'd be perfect.
120.
130, thank you.
He did say he was on to a
promise at the wedding
before she bailed.
There you go. It's totally on.
150 at the back.
Okay.
Any more? It's funny.
I went round to say thank you
for what she did at our wedding.
Not yet.
You know when you've just met
someone, but straightaway,
you feel as if they're
going to be your friend?
170? 180?
Nearly there.
Who knows why.
Past life, physiognomy.
190? But for some reason,
you just kind of click.
Here we go.
210?
210?
Bollocks. I don't
know what I'm saying,
but do you know what I mean?
Baby, we lost it... the sofa.
What?
210 pounds... Over our limit.
400.
400?
What are you doing?
I live here. What are you doing?
I came to tidy.
You should be dressed, Mum.
Well, I was.
I'm settling in for the evening.
It's 5:00.
You said you were
going out later.
No, you said I was
going out later.
Have you finished work
already?
I'm busy tonight.
Got a date?
Does my daughter have a date?
No,
but you could have.
Oh, tea dances.
Reading groups.
Bridge clubs. Tragic attempts
by lonely old coffin-dodgers
to meet someone
before they give up and peg out.
Everybody looking for love.
Well, they won't find it.
And they certainly
won't get sex.
All those men are so old,
it'd be like playing
snooker with a rope.
You know those people are sad.
You're sad. No.
I'm depressed.
There's a difference.
I wish you'd get a life.
I wish you would.
Yes, I know you do.
Toby, I'm telling you
that's the number!
You've got to believe me.
Oh, come on, Toby. Don't
play that with me.
We're friends.
Aren't we friends?
Well, I like you.
Look, would you believe
it if Heck told you?
You would?
Thank you very much.
Hey, Toby.
Yeah, I know, weird,
but believe him, okay?
Okay, speak soon.
All good.
You see, the truth never fails.
Yeah, except we were lying.
Hmm.
Oh, sorry I'm late,
beautiful person.
You look spectacular.
How was work?
Shite. I'm quitting.
You always say that.
Just watch me. One
day I'll do it.
Tell them I don't like
them or their cash.
Although I do like their cash.
Whatever.
A little something to walk out.
I'll be waiting with champagne.
How much do I wish it
was just us tonight.
He'll definitely be
into her, right?
Coop? He'll fancy Luce.
She's got a pulse, hasn't she?
No, but I mean, you do.
You would?
Well, she's not really my
bag of chips, darling,
but yeah, I suppose.
Oh, what do you think?
Of her? I haven't really.
No, no, the shirt.
Oh, uh, it's gorgeous.
You're gorgeous.
Yeah?
Want to, uh, fool around?
Saved by the bell,
but you're in a lot
of trouble later.
Hey. Hey.
Come in.
You look fab. Thank you.
Guess what I brought.
Bless you.
Rach will flip.
Sweetheart.
Here I am.
Hey. Hi.
So come check out our new sofa.
Our expensive new sofa.
You can't put a
price on comfort.
You see? Woman after
my own heart.
Do you believe in reincarnation?
It's just that Rach thought
you guys had met before.
That's not quite what I...
I'd have remembered, I think.
Well, let's hang these flowers
and get that jacket
in some water.
I'll do it. Ta.
Thanks. Thank you, darling.
So, basically, the book
I've wanted to write
is a guide to wherever
is the coolest place
on the planet at the time.
If it's February, it's
the Rio Carnival,
and if it's, I don't know, May,
it's bulls in Pamplona.
So if you want a holiday/party,
then, uh, you know,
you open the book
and there's me telling
you where to go.
'Cause you've been there?
Yeah, that was the plan,
but, uh, you know...
Rach, life, work.
Rach.
Well, someday.
Yeah, maybe.
Anyway, how about you? Married?
Ever been married?
Ever gonna be married?
Uh, no, no, and maybe now
the laws have changed.
How do you mean? I'm gay.
Hmm.
Lovely.
Well done.
That'll be Cooper.
Cooper's coming?
Yeah.
Mm.
Heck?
Hmm?
This is absolutely revolting.
You think so?
It is, sweetheart.
It's atrocious.
Anyway, more
importantly, listen,
it's been three weeks now.
Let's have it.
How much better is
sex after marriage?
Please.
Because when I've
had sex with people
after they were married,
they have said that
it's fantastic.
Rach?
Get wed and find out yourself.
Cooper couldn't make
that commitment.
We're talking about two or
three years of his life.
I'm not a one-person person.
You really think your
other half is out there?
Or, you know, in here?
Actually, Rach...
What, there's some
gorgeous women around.
Yes, there are.
And I'm trying to sleep
with as many as I can.
And you never fail, do you?
You know they teach the birds
and the bees about me.
It'll all change when
you meet Miss Right.
And how am I suppose to
know when I do that? Hmm?
You don't know,
not straightaway.
It just feels warm
and comfortable
and you hang in there
and give it a chance.
Before you know it,
you're like, yeah, this is it.
Must be love.
Yeah, I'm with you.
I'm with her, too.
Give me that.
I don't agree. I think
you know immediately.
As soon as your eyes...
Then everything that happens
from then on just proves
that you had been right
in that first moment.
When you suddenly realized
you had been incomplete,
and now you are whole.
Actually, I'm with her instead.
I'm with her, too.
Sordid. So who's for pudding?
Yes. No.
No? No, if you think that,
you think that everyone
that doesn't have
all that business is
settling for less...
No, that's not what I'm saying.
That kind of is
what you're saying.
I think she said it a bit nicer.
Trifle?
You look tired, Chief.
You have a good day at work?
Shite. I'm quitting.
Did you check out
flower girl back there?
Made that speech for me.
Later on tonight, we're
going to fall madly in bed.
Oh, it's going well
for you guys, eh?
It's going very well. Hmm.
She's a lesbian.
Is that right?
Cool.
You don't think that
slightly impedes
your plans for seduction?
Anyone can change teams.
Not anyone. I wouldn't,
'cause, well, you know,
but anyone, I mean...
What are you doing?
It's gorgeous!
It's raining.
Heck won't come up here.
They say it's a subconscious
fear you'll throw yourself off,
but he freaks when I
go near the edge, too.
Sorry about dinner.
I've eaten worse.
I kind of went off.
You didn't go off.
Hmm, you went a little way off.
You're wet.
I'm fine.
And you're cold.
I'm fine.
You can have it. Really, you can have it.
I'm so fine.
It's fine. Now you're cold.
Hey, what are you guys up to?
Nothing.
Well, Coop wants to
play strip poker
or strip Cooper,
and I really want
him to go home.
Good night.
See you soon.
One... oh, two.
Thanks for dinner.
Bye.
Cheers, Coop.
Next left.
That's one option, yes.
How about instead,
we just go straight
back to my place?
Coop, take the next left.
You all right, Luce?
Why, because I don't
want to shag you?
You're welcome not to shag me.
Just don't sit in my car
all bored like that. Hmm?
I'm sorry.
Really.
You got something on your
mind; that's obvious.
You know what you should do?
You should share with me.
Because beneath this
rugged exterior
beats a sensitive soul.
No, there doesn't.
No, there doesn't,
but tell me anyway.
It's a girl thing,
though, right?
I mean, it's got to be.
It's a hot and horny scene.
It's you and another
Sagittarian.
Come on.
Tell Uncle Cooper all about it.
Spare me no detail.
Have you ever... met
someone and just...
but they're with
someone else already?
Yeah, sure.
The hot ones are always taken.
So what do you do?
What do I do?
I shag 'em.
The partner is their problem.
It's not mine.
Yeah, I think you don't
mess with other couples.
Don't cause that pain ever.
You just face facts
that it can't happen.
Walk away.
Hook up
with someone available instead.
Well, your place or mine?
Come on, let's.
I'm so good in bed.
So you promise me
the whole matchmaking
thing is over, right?
Last night was a big success.
They left together.
That distant sound you
hear is wedding bells.
Wait, you didn't twig?
Oh, damn, you're so uncool.
What? Twig what?
Well, the thing you
don't know about Luce
is the fact that she's...
Right here. Hey, hey.
Hey, hi. Hello.
Weirdest thing. We were
just talking about you.
Oh, all nice, I hope.
Oh, sorry, Heck. This is Edie.
Edie. Heck.
And Rachel.
Rachel.
Edie.
Luce?
Good.
So, um... Saturday shopping?
Is right.
Great.
Enjoy it, and listen,
thanks for dinner.
We should definitely...
Definitely. We will.
Okay, well, have a
nice rest of shop.
You, too.
So you're going tonight? Because
I was thinking maybe I...
Whoa, pussycat.
What the hell was
going on there?
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.
Luce is gay.
She's gay?
As a tennis player.
Hey, you recognize
the girlfriend?
She's not just heterosexual.
She's, like, Barbie
heterosexual.
Whoa-whoa, hey! How
are you doing?
We were just talking
about you this time.
We'll be late for kickoff.
Oh, there's hours yet.
We support the same
football team.
Oh, how darling.
Isn't that darling?
Good. Well, hope you win.
Edie, are you gay?
Oh, God.
Am I gay?
I'm ecstatic.
And you two...? No, no.
We're not. I've
tried and I tried,
but she loves another.
Huh. So I'll call you.
Do, 'cause we should definitely.
Definitely.
We will. We're going that way.
Yep, bye again.
Bye.
So I found out they
are not an item.
Yeah, very tactful. Let's pay.
Hi!
Are you stalking us?
And why would we do
a thing like that?
We'll be at this till... Waving.
We'll wave back.
And do. Oh, we must.
Definitely.

It's really good jam.
I should make jam.
I could make it, you know.
Of course you could.
You don't think I could.
Not for a second.
Anyway, I was talking
to Rob yesterday.
That man's an arse.
That man is an arse.
But he's got this really
sweet girlfriend.
God knows what she's found to
love about him, but she does.
And he cheats on
her like a nutter.
Oh, come back to bed.
I'm up now.
Does she know?
Well, I'm like, "If you
want to leave, tell her."
Are you really up?
I really am.
Maybe he doesn't want to leave.
Maybe he doesn't
know what he wants.
Anyway, he should figure it
out before someone gets hurt.
Why are you looking at me?
Because you're the person.
You wait till I make jam.
That'll rock your world.
What about a bit
more color in there?
I've got some lovely lilac.
Oh, why not?
They're, uh, for my boyfriend.
I'm going to tell him
we're having a baby.
That's great.
I think so.
Uh... He will too.
He definitely will.
He's a bit of a control freak.
I'm surprised he doesn't
wear the diaphragm.
He's, uh...
He's gonna hate me.
He's gonna hate me.
I-I-I love him so much!
Yeah, I'm surprised.
He sounds wonderful.
I-I didn't I, I...
Um, I should...
Tell me what to do.
Whatever it is...
Just let me, um...
Flowered Up.
Yes, I can do a delivery.
Right now? No, it's no problem.
Hi.
I was told to deliver
these to table 7?
Oh, certainly. It's
through there.
Cute, huh?
Very cute.
Fuck me if I'm wrong,
but I think you want to kiss me.
Coop, you and me.
It's not going to happen.
It's not?
I'll be your friend.
Well, that'll do.
For now.
Really?
My daughter's school
presentation?
You should have let
them get T-shirts made.
It's not really
that kind of deal.
Probably a blessing.
Your father doesn't
have the body for them.
Of course, I'm just
speaking from memory.
Hi.
Lucy, darling, what
are you doing here?
I helped H with her, um,
well, she invited me.
Henrietta is ready to start now.
This is space.
Space is many light-years away.
Light-years are not made in days
or months, but in kilometers.
There is a good reason for this,
but I don't quite
understand it yet.
This picture is the Milky Way.
It's made up of lots of stars
and there's a
celestial phenoma...
phe-nom-enon.
One of the best constellations
is Ursus Major, which is
Latin American for "Big Bear."
It's called that because one day
in the olden times that
never really happened,
a naughty god called Zeus
wanted to go to bed with
someone he wasn't married to.
His wife was about
to catch him...
and that's everything you
need to know about space.
So, good.
Very good.
You have to go, right?
Um... but I don't.
I'm okay.
Luce, I, uh...
I think that we should
talk about something.
It's just, I don't know.
When I'm with... Yeah,
uh, I do have to go.
Oh. Actually, I just realized
I've, um, got a delivery.
Oh, yeah, right.
You go.
Yeah.
Listen to this.
"In her acceptance speech,
the distinguished scientist
"paid tribute to her husband, Dr.
Chris Davis." Spelt wrong.
"Tomorrow the pair celebrate
their 42nd wedding anniversary
"after eloping together
on the day they met.
"When asked how they could
possibly have known
"it would all work out,
Professor Harrison...
professor... "replied in
true scientific fashion",
"'You don't know. You
can never be sure.
"'But you take the
plunge anyway.
'Sure works for people
who don't love enough.'"
Oh... Oh...
Do you guys believe in
love at first sight?
Well, it saves time.
No, really, that you could
meet someone, or just...
cross a room,
and with that one glance
you could look in their
eyes and see their soul.
Do you believe
that could happen?
No.
Absolutely not.
No, me, neither.
These are due back Thursday.
If we're closed, just put
them through the door.
Enjoy.
Thanks a lot.
Thanks.
Hi. These, please.
And this as well.
It's just...
It's for research.
Call it what you want, darling.
It's actually out.
Oh, that's okay. It
doesn't interest...
Although it's due back.
I'll give him a call.
Oh, no, honestly.
Hey, trust me:
this one you want to see.
Hello, Cass?
Yes, Terri from the vid shop.
I thought it was you.
Mum!
I was just dropping by
with the wedding snaps.
Oh, I tell you, that
photographer should be sacked.
He made me look like a thug.
A thug in lilac.
Anything good?
N-no. N-no.
There's a lady here
needs your copy
of Georgie's Bush.
Georgie's Bush?
It's for research.
Oh.
It's for Heck.
He's very interested
in American politics.
She's bringing it 'round.
Well, I call that very sexy.
Hmm?
I wouldn't kick him out of bed
for eating crackers, would you?
Oh, Georgie! Oh...
Call me Mrs. Prejudice.
Babe, are you home?
"You have won a share
of one million pounds."
Oh, you are home.
Hi! Oh, God.
Am I glad to see you.
The morning I've had,
I just had to get
away, you know?
Shall I burn some lunch?
Please.
Hey, you got some vids.
Yeah, don't bother looking.
I just got...
This one's great.
This one got pans, but whatever.
And here's one that I
haven't seen before.
Which? Are you... um...?
Oh...
They gave me the wrong one.
Oh, my God. That...
The woman at the video store.
I'll take it back.
Yeah, take it back. Yeah,
that's excellent, yeah.
I mean, what, it's porn?
Right? It's degrading.
It's offensive. God, yes.
Yeah. Let's watch it anyway.
Come on, Rach, I mean,
things have been getting
a big slack in that
department recently.
I know it's my fault and it's all...
Yeah.
No, it's mine. I, um...
But I don't want to watch this.
Why?
It doesn't turn me on.
Well, that's one of us.
I love the smell of hot
dog in the evening.
It smells like...
hot dog.
Yeah.
Thing is, Ned, what I
wanted to ask was...
Um, turkey.
I was just wondering if
it was just a bit odd,
for you guys, you know,
after you got married...
if, uh, the interplay
between you two
got a bit... clutchy.
Some onions?
No. Thanks.
Because, what I'm finding...
Mustard? Ketchup?
I'm trying to talk to you here.
Oh, what about, dear boy?
Why, i-it's just,
I'm just, well...
I'm finding it a bit tricky
at the moment with Rachel.
Oh, God, you mustn't discuss her with me.
Never do that.
Sorry? Well, that's
our problem, you see.
The two of us, we could be
most pleasant to each other,
talk of sport or weather
till our throats hurt.
Yeah. Yeah.
Never mention relations.
As soon as you do, the
only concrete thought
running through my mind is...
that hound is putting
it up my daughter.
Rach!
Darling, I don't know what
to do about your father.
He's never been
the last of the red-hot lovers
but, recently, it's
got to the point
where he's jealous
of a stiff wind.
Hey, you guys.
Thank God you're here.
You have no idea.
Good. I've got you both.
Now, how are my
grandchildren coming along?
Could you get me away
from her, please?
Just hinting, darling.
One wants to have them
while one's still young
enough to pick them up.
Ooh!
What I do with your parents
is remind myself that,
if it wasn't for them,
I wouldn't have you.
What's up, baby?
Let's go home.
Now, remember, try not to look
like you're my child, okay?
Because it... it...
it puts men off.
But keep you eyes peeled,
and, if you spot
anyone you think,
you know, well, he looks nice...
Hi. Luce!
Hey! Hey! How you doing?
This is my friend Beth.
She's on the roam.
Now you found a friend.
Can I go home?
No. I'm trying to
find her a man.
There aren't any. Trust me.
I've looked.
Oh, careful!
Sorry, Missus.
Don't call me Missus.
Hello.
All right.
Brilliant.
You've got a boyfriend.
You've got a boyfriend.
No, I haven't. Not yet.
I can't wait till you
get a boyfriend.
You probably can, actually.
You could even get a husband.
You're old enough, and
I don't like Heck.
H, I should explain
something to you.
I do believe I will be with one
person for the rest of my life,
but that person will be a woman.
I understand.
You do?
My best friend is
Natalie Curtis.
I'd rather spend the rest of
my life with her than any boy.
There you go.
It doesn't mean you're
a lesbian or anything.
Come on! Let's go!
I'll put the kettle on, babe.
I'll have a beer instead.
Really?
I was going to ask
you, but, um...
But what?
Rach, are you pregnant?
No. No, I'm not. No.
I just thought it might
explain your recent...
whatever.
It doesn't matter.
Unless, um...
Unless what?
Umm... Do you want
to get pregnant?
You and my mum.
Listen, I know we said
we were going to wait,
but until what?
We're even more settled?
Come on. What do you think?
I've got to take it.
Rob, hey, what's up?
No. I'm good, man.
Yeah, yeah, they're
in my briefcase.
Hang on.
Hello.
Hello?
Hey, gorgeous. That was Rob.
Look, I'm really sorry
about this, but, um...
Of course you should still go.
I wouldn't put you
through my evening
for all the coke in Colombia.
You know, there'll be
the usual bollocks;
everyone will get pissed.
I'll get pissed...
and start singing country
and Western songs badly,
like I always do.
Hello.
Heck. It's Luce.
Hey, Luce. How's it going?
It's Luce. What's up?
Nothing. My phone
just rang, and...
Say, are you busy Tuesday night?
Do you mind escorting
my wife somewhere?
It's just, like,
I've got this wanky
bug thing which I
can't get out of,
and it would be really great
if you'd look after Rach for me?
Go on, say yes.
Go on. Then, yes.
Brilliant. Brilliant.
Well, Rach will ring
you with the details
and, um... be safe.
You, too.
You shouldn't have done that.
I hardly know her.
But she's your "soul mate
for life" -type, then.
Never belt her. Beer.
Does she know where we're going?
Go on. Hurt him! Hurt his legs!
Chop him!
Oh, my God!
That was offsides!
You know, you're kind of shrill.
What?
When you shout.
You want them to hear
your abuse better,
you've got to project it.
Teach me.
Okay. First off, tighten
your stomach muscles.
I don't think I've got any.
Yeah, you do. You really do.
They're right here.
There? Uh-huh.
Tighten. Tighten.
Tense them.
They're pretty tense.
Okay. Next, broaden
your diaphragm.
My what?
It's here.
Oh.
Okay, push it out
against my hand.
You feel my hand?
Maybe if you put
them both there.
Okay, and now for the big one.
Imagine the roof of your
mouth as a cathedral.
No. You've lost me. Come on.
No. The muscles, the diaphragm...
I'm there, but...
It's a space thing.
All right? Your
mouth is that big
that you have to
fill it with sound,
deep from inside,
filling the space,
then throwing it out.
Like how?
Uh... like this.
You're a wanker, number nine!
That's not bad, is it?
No.
All right, so your turn.
Where do you want to go?
I don't care where we go.
Good. I'll decide again.
I feel like dancing.
Boom! Hold that thought.
What? What, you know
somewhere we should go?
I've got an idea.
Let's begin to dancing.
♪ My head is in a spin
♪ My feet don't
touch the ground ♪
Disco, disco, disco!
♪ My head goes round and round
♪ My knees are
shakin', baby Okay.
♪ My heart... It
beats like a drum ♪
Wiggle those hips!
Now we are talking!
♪ It feels like
♪ It feels like I'm in love
♪ Ain't felt this way before,
but I know I'm turned on ♪
Yeah, that's the way!
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
♪ This time it's something,
baby, I can't turn off ♪
♪ My knees are shaking, baby
♪ My heart... It
beats like a drum ♪
I know what I like, and
I exactly what I see!
Boom, boom, choo, choom.
♪ It feels like
♪ It feels like I'm in love.
You guys rule!
All right, more.
Um, tell me about the lily.
You don't want to
know about the lily.
It's my favorite.
Ask me about the azalea.
All right.
What about the azalea?
The azalea means "may you
achieve financial security."
Ugh!
See?
Lovely.
Now tell me about the lily.
The lily means...
The lily means "I
dare you to love me."
Well, thanks for this evening.
Thank you.
It was my birthday.
No! Today? Mm.
You should have said.
It's mine coming up.
We're practically twins.
This is me.
Okay, good night.
Yeah.
Good night.
Hmm, your feet.
Are they cold?
No, they're stinking.
Yes, of course, cold.
Mm. Come here.
You fancy coming around tonight,
or are you too married?
Hmm. Actually, Rach wants
to take me to dinner.
Just fill me up, and wants
to take me to dinner,
which is sweet.
Mm, very sweet.
Yeah.
Blow her off.
Come around mine
for pizza, really.
No, I want you to meet the
Italian girl that delivers it.
What about that
flower girl, Luce?
I thought you had plans there.
Hmm. There's another one that
won't let me get it wet.
She's gay.
I'm a cure for lesbianism.
No, you're a deeply shallow man.
Yes, I am. Hmm.
When's it going to stop?
Never, I hope.
God bless you.
Hmm, really, though.
I mean, I'm 29 years old.
You're 31. Precisely my point.
I'm getting older.
And I see you...
I see what you've got with...
And see that stability
and the trust, the permanence...
And I think,
God, I'm glad I'm not you.
And she thinks I feel totally
100% stable at the moment.
You got trouble in paradise?
No, no, no.
How could there be? We
only just got married.
Milly! Milly, darling!
I mean, it's always,
always, isn't it?
Sorry...
That's okay...
Okay? Don't move.
What?
I notice a-a girl back there
that I never called back.
Just stay perfectly still, okay?
We'll get through this.
Did you ever...
you know, cross the street?
Back to Patty's?
And what?
And what the hell are
you talking about?
Drink after work tonight?
Dinner with Heck.
I mean, did you ever,
fancy or think you might have...
Briefly, before you realized you didn't...
another... woman?
Why?
I'm trying to find
someone for Beth,
and I thought I'd
double my chances.
Already tried it,
didn't happen for me.
I like men.
I mean, I hate
men, but you know.
Oh, I always hoped to do a woman
before I died, but
it's kind of like,
I want to go to Norway sometime.
Do you know what I mean?
Probably never gonna happen.
Is Heck taking you to dinner?
I'm taking him.
How perfect.
That was fun.
Wasn't it fun?
I had a good time.
You know, Rach, I think maybe...
Hey, the Heath...
Do you remember that night
you took me in the bushes?
I never took you in the bushes.
Sorry. Wrong guy.
I took you up against the tree.
Can't be dealing with bushes,
nettles and deadly nightshade.
Let's do it.
What?
Let's go. Let's do it now.
No.
Rach, no.
Rach?
Rach, where are you?
Come on, darling.
Rachel!
I just, I just don't understand
why we have to do this
stuff anymore, you know?
We've got a flat.
It's a good one!
And I've confiscated
your mother's keys
so she can't sneak
up on us anymore
and I swear that woman's
got a sex radar.
We've got a bed! You know, warm;
it's welcoming; it smells nice;
and it's a damn sight better
than this arsing place.
Ah! Jesus Christ!
Let's go.
No, nettles everywhere.
What are you doing?
Taking off your clothes.
That's one of the good
things about being a man.
Hmm?
You can do these things
without stripping off.
Just a zip, a simple
zip, is all you need.
Give it a yank, and you're
well away, darling.
Are you going to talk
all through this?
Did I mention we have a bed?
What was that?
What?
Nothing. Nothing.
All right, whoever's
behind there,
come out before we beat
the crap out of you.
Yeah, damn it.
Terribly sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.
Oh, God.
We were trying not
to disturb you.
That's fine, really.
Disturb us? No, no, you
didn't disturb us.
We were just...
So were we.
I see. You think we were...
No, and we're married.
And we have a bed.
I'm Heck, by the way.
Michael.
How do you do? Michael, too.
Oh, really. Rachel.
It's lovely to meet
you two chaps.
Must be very nice to be married.
We only just met this evening.
Yes, sometimes I feel
like we did, too.
Hi. No, no.
You're not your happy to see...
You can't.
I don't want you to
be happy to see me.
Okay.
Okay, so, so I'm here
because I don't know
what's going on.
I don't...
You make me feel something.
Something I absolutely
cannot feel.
I'm married. I'm married,
for Christ's sake.
I have a husband.
This man that I...
This lovely guy. He's
done nothing wrong.
Ah, I was wondering
if you could help me.
I'm hoping to start
a herb garden.
A little corner space.
Not much light. These, these,
on the house, go.
Okay, so do you see?
You have to see.
I can't do this.
I can't actually do this.
So whatever it is, or
was, it's got to stop
and it's got to stop now.
Do you understand?
It's over.
Ow! What, what, what?
Thorns. Thorns in my bum.
Ow. Ow.
I'm sorry.
Ah!
It's another customer.
Hello?
Luce?
Luce, are you in the back?
Um, don't come in, Heck.
I...
I was, um...
I was sorting, you know,
counting the, uh...
Hey.
Hey, yourself.
What do you want, Heck?
To buy some flowers. What else?
Flowers, of course.
Not for me, for my wife Rachel.
Recently, she's just been
a bit, I don't know...
You know what they say,
there's nothing
quite as cheering
as a well-timed bloom.
So I thought one of your
finest arrangements.
Absolutely.
What does she like?
Well, you know what she likes.
Lilies. She likes lilies.
Lilies, right. Well,
that's simple.
Yeah.
So did you enjoy the
football the other night?
Um, it was an experience.
And how did you find Rachel?
Fine.
I mean, I wouldn't...
Fine.
I don't suppose she, um... no.
Well, I was just wondering
if she said anything
about me, or, um...
I just think I'm doing
something wrong is all.
I mean, that's what I think.
And if she said what it is
that I'm doing or not doing,
then I can stop it,
or start or whatever, you see?
And then we can...
like before.
We can get back to
being like before.
She didn't say anything.
No?
I've embarrassed you,
and myself, which is
normal, very normal.
Um, these are beautiful.
How much do I owe you?
No, they're on the house.
Thanks.
You should ask her, you know?
Not me.
Bless you, but, um...
I can't ask Rachel if
there's anything wrong.
I mean, that's way too scary.
Why?
What if there is?
Thanks.
Rachel!
Rachel, wait!
Luce, please. Just talk to me.
What do you want me to say?
I heard him! Jesus!
I'm lying there,
and I heard him,
and he's blaming himself!
You can put an end to this.
How?
Tell me to go.
Tell me that's what you
want and I will walk away,
and you will never see me again.
Is that what you want?
I want you.
Luce...
I know.
I can't...
I know.
We'll be okay.
Don't forget me.
I won't remember anything else.
Come on, Jeff. You
scratch my back,
and I'll kiss your ass.
Okay, can you repeat
that, please?
We'll go 41 flat.
Okay, well, let me just fax
it over on his computer
and crunch some numbers.
He can't go any higher.
He hasn't got it.
Yeah, screen's flashing
red at me here, Jeff.
It's not going to cut it.
In fact, the figure
that I'm reading is...
Yeah, well, the
figure I'm reading
is 41 and a half, that's 41.5,
Any lower just can't be a go.
That's way too much.
It's too much.
So let's do it, Jeff.
Let's work our web.
Give me 41.1, give me that.
We're feeling no pain there.
You know what? If we're up .1,
let's, uh, let's have some fun.
Let's double down.
Yeah. Yeah, there you go.
All right, keep on coming.
Keep on coming. Give me three.
Three's willing.
Give me that right now.
You will?
Well, then go one more.
Go to four.
I really, really, really
don't want to do it.
Jeff, you know, don't
take that tone with me.
You know, I've given
you a chance here.
Now do you want to be a big dog,
or do you want to play on
the porch with the puppies?
Yeah. Yeah, I feel that.
Okay, last one, my friend.
Over the cliff.
I'm holding your hand.
I'm cupping your balls.
I'm there with you and
I'm there for you.
And you've got to ask yourself,
Jeffrey: do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
Congratulations. We can deal.
My boy, for that you get a
bonus as big as my knob.
Screw your bonus.
I wish I could. Now where do
you want to go for a drink?
Screw you, too, Rob.
Hecky, what is it?
It makes me sick, you know?
You lie. You just lie.
Well, so do you.
Not anymore.
Heck... Hecky?
Hecky, come back.
Hi.
Afternoon.
Looking for a breakup plant.
A what?
A breakup plant.
Explain.
Well, I don't like
my girlfriend.
I want to break up with her
via the means of plant.
Well, it should be
a breakup bouquet,
and it should be hydrangeas.
They mean "It's over,
but think well of me."
Perfect.
I'll take one.
One bouquet?
One pair of what's it.
Well, that's not a lot.
Well, I don't care if
she thinks well of me.
Do you know what? Piss off.
Pardon me? Out. Get
out of my shop.
She's well rid of
your fat ass anyway.
Mum?
I'll be right out!
Take your time.
Well, sweet shit in a bucket,
what's wrong with you?
Blow your nose, then explain.
I met this girl.
She's with someone else.
Does she love you?
I don't know.
No.
Yes.
But it doesn't matter.
Oh, it's all that matters.
She's with someone else.
She can't...
When Dad left you,
he broke your heart.
It mends again.
Look at you. You look fantastic.
I may be older than God, but
I can still make an effort.
A date?
Does my mother
have a date?
I'm going to eat food
with a man, yes.
How do you feel?
Oh, um, well, you know,
when you're holding
a hot cup of coffee
and you realize you're
going to sneeze?
That's how I feel.
Come here.
Oh, baby.
♪ And that's why they call her
♪ Blue McGill...
Oh, shit, Heck,
where have you...
♪ She was a lonesome little
cowgirl called Rachel... ♪
Never fails... eight pints
of water before bed,
the next day I'm
feeling no pain.
Are you well, my
gorgeous darling?
I want to talk to you.
I want to talk to you, too.
Just, um... three more of these,
and I'm quite
literally all ears.
I'll be waiting.
Mm-hmm.
Very... listening.
Oh!
Shoot.
I-I wanted to talk to
you because, um...
I have to talk to you because
this thing happened.
I wasn't looking for it.
It just hap...
It just happened,
and although...
it's over,
um...
you have a right to know.
I went crazy, Heck.
I went crazy for someone,
and it wasn't you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so very sorry, so...
Please believe me.
Heck...
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, don't sleep.
Wake... Heck?
I can't say this more than once.
I'm staying.
I couldn't, wouldn't leave you.
You're my best friend.
And that was enough before.
It'll be enough again, so...
Coop.
It is you, then.
Is it?
Is what? I don't...
Heck doesn't know.
He said that she
didn't tell who.
But, um, I figured it out.
What'd he say?
Just tell me I'm wrong, girl.
Hmm? Tell me.
You dumb slut.
Don't start, Coop.
Don't start?
Her husband, her
flippin' husband
calls me in the
middle of the night.
You want to know how he was?
He was busted.
Just-just get out.
What was that thing that you said?
What was that?
Never wreck another couple.
You really stuck to that
one good, didn't you?
Okay, then.
Okay. Yeah.
See you. Bye.
It's wonderful. Thank you.
There's a lovely section on
cooking with your children.
Who was on the phone, honey?
Luce.
She was supposed to take
me and my boyfriend
to the museum, but
now we're not.
Oh, uh... maybe some other time.
Not for a while.
She's going on a
very long holiday.
She is?
When was the last time
you took me on holiday?
The summer of '94.
Great Barrier Reef.
You scared all the sharks away.
She didn't mention
that the other night.
No, yes, she did say
something, I remember now.
Will you take me to the museum?
And can Heck come, too?
Of course he can.
Do penguins have knees?
Well, this is fun, isn't it?
Shame it's only once a year.
Happy birthday to you.
♪ Happy birthday to you
♪ Happy birthday, dear Rachel
I can't handle this. Heck.
♪ Happy birthday to you.
I can't do it, Rach.
I can't do it.
I thought I could,
but I can't do it.
Blow out the candles, darling.
What's happening?
I'm going. It's good cake.
Your mother got the
recipe from this book
before she wrapped it.
I'm not gonna leave you.
If you respect me at all,
that's exactly what you will do.
Will you kindly tell me
what you're talking about?
Why's Heck being sad?
It's not you leaving
that's gonna kill me.
It's you loving someone more.
Sorry to interrupt.
Those candles are dripping wax
all over your mother's creation.
Will you fuck off with
the fucking candles!
Yeah. Yeah.
No, you're not walking away.
Don't-don't walk away from me.
Yeah, keep saying that.
Let me pretend
this is my choice.
What do you mean?
Oh, come on, Rach,
you both know you left
me in the end anyway.
That's not true. Yes, it is!
Yes, it is.
I want you to be happy.
More than anything else, I wanted to
be the cause of happiness in you.
But if I'm not,
then...
I can't stand in the way.
Do you see?
Because what you're feeling now...
Rachel,
is the unstoppable force.
Which means that
I've got to move.
Darling, what did Heck mean
when he said you're in
love with someone else?
I am in love with someone else.
Cooper. That trollop.
He'd shag an open wound.
Not him.
Who, then?
Well, out with it.
What's his name? Who
is the lucky chap?
Her name... is Luce.
Luce?
Yes.
Who's a woman.
As are you a woman.
That's right.
So the two of you are...
"lesbie" friends?
It doesn't matter
what you call it,
it's not going to happen.
Not after all this.
Quite bloody right.
Could I...
say something here?
When I first met your mother...
back in the Trojan War...
I fell for her...
right off the bat.
And although she loved me
back, she married me...
somehow I always knew I was...
never quite up to snuff.
We muddled along,
got through the years,
but I never doubted that if she ever
met anyone she really fell for,
who made her realize
what true love is...
she'd leave me like a shot.
And how could I argue?
Whatever you choose
to do from here,
we'll support you;
we always will.
But please, my darling...
follow your heart.
Can I borrow your car?
I'll drive you.
Nothing happens
without me there.
You coming?
When we come back,
we'll talk about this
if you want to.
Yeah.
Do you know what I wish?
You wouldn't grow up so fast.
You take care, then.
You take care.
I'm going to enjoy myself.
Hey.
You did nothing wrong.
I did.
Truth is, I'd do it again.
Why don't you have
pudding after breakfast?
You have it after
lunch and dinner,
so why not in the
morning, as well?
I think it weird.
You're still sad, aren't you?
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
I knew you would be.
I bought you sweets.
Thank you.
Great.
I didn't know which
is your favorite,
so I bought pick mix.
Oh, sorry, H. Sorry.
It's just, um...
I'm trying to do the
right thing, and, um...
and now I think I
should have not.
'Cause... if she'd stayed
with me out of guilt,
that would have been
fine, wouldn't it?
I mean, wouldn't it?
My math teacher, Mrs. Latracy,
has something she always
says when people are sad.
She says no problem
isn't soluble
given a big enough plastic bag.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
She's a bit unusual.
I should have married you.
Maybe in ten years.
If you're still lonely, we
could get married then.
You know, it's funny.
Ever since we first
met, I was...
scared that she was
going to leave me.
You shouldn't be afraid, Heck.
You can do anything.
Hurry, hurry, please.
Take a left here.
I just think if not Heck,
there must be other
fish in the sea.
Male fish.
Is it straight on? Yes.
It's rather exciting.
What about my grandchildren?
Who will be providing them?
I believe there's a
marvelous new invention,
somewhat akin to
the turkey baster.
Just up here.
Hey, where did you two meet?
At my wedding.
But it's such a short time.
How can you be sure?
I knew after three seconds.
I've heard of love
happening that fast.
The French call it le flash.
They would, bloody perverts.
Where's Luce? Is she here?
Would you like to try
that entrance again?
Hello.
Please.
I'm looking for Luce.
You're her, aren't you?
You're the girl.
Yes, I am.
You have a husband.
I left him.
He left me.
It doesn't matter. It's over.
So you're free?
And you love my daughter?
Golly.
Um, have you ever
sold flowers before?
Watch it!
And what would you be wearing?
I like that.
I like that very much.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Do you mind? I'm talking here!
Are you sure this is the best
way 'cause the traffic's...
I'll meet you at home, my angel.
And will you be waiting
downstairs or upstairs?
You're quite wrong, you know.
You've always been
enough for me.
Not recently.
There are pills one can take.
I could buy some.
If you could, perhaps...
be a little kinder?
Yes, I could.
Darling, try a left up here.
That's generally quicker.
Well done.
Hang on.
Three cheers for my husband!
As much use as a
fart in a jam jar.
Oh, that was the shortest
honeymoon in history.
