- Thank you.
- Uh-hm. Change for you?
- It's ok. Pleasure.
- Thank you.
- Did you see?
- I'm a little busy now.
When you see what's here,
you're gonna be very thankful.
I really don't have time,
when I'm working.
Well, what'do'ya got now?
- Patience.
- Your time is up, Olga.
Look at them.
And the farmer is shouting
at us. No way. You know.
I can't help myself...
I can't help myself...
I gotta' go!
But what about these customers?
Yeah, we've got
a few more days left.
Girls, I'm sorry, I'm going.
Hey there, ladies,
you on strike?
Take a seat.
- Where's mine?
- Over there.
- Hey there.
- It's good.
Here-we-go!
So, how've you been?
It's been such a long
time, hasn't it? Hey there.
I've been
so busy training.
Just what... I should
that from him?
You look good.
Not so sure.
How do you know him?
We dated.
You'll watch my ears this time,
huh? Won't you?
You're not in Kiev.
You're not either.
- You haven't changed.
- Shut-up.
Olga!
Come take a ride
for the old days.
You and me?
Yeah, I think
I'd be up for that.
Somewhere you need to be?
I'll just see you in three
weeks for your trim, maybe.
Olga, the bus.
Come on, come on,
come on. Wait at the doors.
Come on Granny,
scooch over.
Can I just get through here?
Cheap prostitutes
so full of damn cheer.
You just wish you were us.
Oh please.
Close your legs;
you're off the clock.
You're just silly.
If you ask me, most girls
would give up their mother
for a chance
with that man.
- What an idiot.
- Why did we stop so quick?
What is this?
What happened?
The door!
Excuse me!
Only be a second.
Who's this guy?
Olga, step outside
for a quick stroll, or we wait.
Young woman,
don't keep us waiting.
- What she gonna' do?
- Can we go now?
- Finally.
- See ya.
You good?
Good.
Will you let me hold you?
You go first.
I'm sorry.
Beautiful-Olga.
My Alex.
Just wondering, you got plans?
You're the one who's
always full of surprises.
How about a restaurant?
To Kiev, we go.
I remember being so
broke going out with you,
we shared an ice cream.
So you're in the mood
for ice cream?
One for each.
Mm-hmm.
Sorry, sir.
- How many?
- And here you go. Good.
- There's one.
- Thank you.
Mm!
What about riding
on the Ferris wheel?
I think it's closed
until the first of May.
Meh, our fire brigade
performed the inspection.
As a favor.
I'm sure they'd give us
a private ride.
- So you are still twenty!
- What? Nah.
Here's good.
Thank you for today.
Have a nice evening.
And the Kiev cake we bought?
I don't know
if we should, but...
But I'm gonna miss you.
Goodbye.
Olga!
Sorry.
Alex, another time please.
Hey, fellas!
What's the party?
Celebrating Soviet Industry.
What, you got a man
up there watching?
Um, no.
I won't try anything.
I just wanna talk
to you; that's it.
We were something once.
You showed me
such a wonderful time.
It's been a while, that's all.
So I gotta wait
for my hair to grow?
Goodbye.
I'm here!
Hey...
- I don't like that school.
- You'll make friends soon.
They're all
scientist-kids, smart alecs.
Olga?
Olga?
Olga, you forgot the cake
in the car.
- Come on. Ol!
- Please go away.
Olga, you don't need to be
ashamed of where you live.
Go.
Alex, my son.
And that's Alexey.
You'll both get along pretty well.
Join us?
- I would, yes.
- So come in.
- Hey there, dude.
- Hi.
You two can chat.
I'm gonna change.
Who are you?
Uh... I just practice...
I hold the sun.
How?
Well, you know how the sun
gets so very hot,
that someone has to make
sure it stays safely
contained here on earth.
Oh, that's nothing.
Everybody works at the reactor.
Maybe, but
the best are firemen.
- That's not the reactor.
- I'm their inspector.
I've seen every
single inch of them.
All four reactors.
- An exhibition?
- Posters of friends.
Ah.
Huh?
I know him, and him...
wait, who's that Kazakh?
That's Jackie Chan.
He's from Hong Kong. Like Bruce Lee.
What's that?
This one isn't very good
for filming movies.
It belonged to my Grandpa.
Mm-hmm.
You two friends?
We need to talk.
- How old is he?
- He's ten.
Whose is he?
You know whose.
How could you not tell me?
I didn't even know
where you were living.
- How's the cake?
- It'll do.
Cut me one then, too?
We should tell him.
We'll tell him nothing.
Eat your cake.
Hold it.
What's tomorrow, the twelfth?
It's a free day, right.
I'll stop buy, pick up
some presents.
And then we'll all have dinner.
Alright?
- Bye, Olga.
- I'm working tomorrow.
Can you call in sick?
Sure, maybe I'll ask
Marina to help.
Marina...
Yeah. That'll work.
That's perfect.
See you at nine, then?
It'll be our morning.
Alex?
What can I say, fellas?
When I leave, you'll be missed.
I gave you all the very
best of me...
my youth, my health,
wisdom there too,
all for a better future.
- Attention!
- Go on!
You still owe me ten rubles.
Tigran, you just can't
be trusted with money.
If I'd pay you back right now,
you'd just go and buy a tool.
How will you all
manage without me?
We'll have a chance
to do some work.
We all know your
only drill, Colonel,
is breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Well friends,
at least I know that
the wind isn't going
to knock me over.
Cheers to all of you.
Let's get this over with.
Okay!
Alright!
Ugh! Ah!
Yo, hey Alex!
Yeah! Yeah!
I'm gonna get you!
Come on!
Come on.
You just have no respect
for your elders.
- This Valery?
- My baby brother.
A good student.
At the reactor.
Sergey, please.
Nice to meet you.
Same here.
- Uh-huh. Okay.
- Here.
So, where's the box?
What box?
It's second-hand, Sergey.
A box would be nice.
So, um...
Here's the money.
- Be quick. All good?
- I'll just trust you.
Count it.
Here's the camera with the box.
I barely used it.
And I gave it a good cleaning.
- Hm, okay.
- Oh, ya! With the manual.
- Oh, the bag.
- Oh, take it.
You're a damn good firefighter.
You should've stayed on.
I'm done with
wandering aimlessly
through corridors, Sergey.
You're tired.
You want more?
I wanna go watch
Alla Pugacheva.
You wait, she'll come here.
You're dreaming
in your own dream town.
Alright.
Stop by later.
For my party. It'll be fun.
See ya.
Sergey, until then.
- You coming, or not?
- Yep.
Hm?
That's not Chanel.
I thought you would like it.
Bring it back
first thing tomorrow.
Thought I'd have
at least two days.
I thought I'd have Chanel.
You are enjoying this.
Alex!
Alex!
- Hey, dude...
- Hey.
I got you a little something.
Here.
- What's that?
- It's a professional camera.
- Really?
- You bet.
- It's a Lomo!
- Mm-hmm...
- Oh. How'd you get it?
- With some patience.
Wow.
So cool.
It's perfect.
You haven't been around.
Sorry, I um, got busy.
Oh, manual.
There.
What about mother?
Tell her it's Christmas.
Go play now.
Hey, what happened?
Let me see it.
Whoa.
Cool.
Is that a Lomo?
All right.
Remember the fire
at reactor three?
Excuse me. Sure.
May I?
We were all sweating
like pigs.
Alex stripped down
to his briefs and sunglasses
and started dousing the dry
wall with buckets of water.
A rainbow above him.
All for Lenka,
that girl in the office,
admiring him from the window.
Mmh.
You're making that up.
He got the entire brigade
big fat bonuses.
How about we talk
about this later?
Alex, I envy you,
y'know?
Self-determination
is your strength.
Nobody tells you what to do.
You're free as a bird.
Well, here's to your freedom.
- Hurrah.
- Hurrah, Alex! Ooh...
- I'll miss him.
- Thank you, Alex!
Whoo!
- Uh. You've had enough.
- Come on...!
Perfect, you want
a little bit more?
You gotta be kidding...
- I'll be back.
- Okay.
Do you think he's okay?
Good, brother.
- Eat up.
- After I finish.
- Turn that thing off.
- Uh huh, stop stopping me.
You're gonna have
to give that back.
But Mom, it's a present.
I'll get it!
It's Santa Claus!
Ho, ho, ho.
Yeah.
Little dude,
just look at you, huh!
Oh goodness, you're so good!
I just can't even!
Have you been drinking?
A little bit.
You go play.
Mom, please could Alex
stay for dinner?
I'll think about it.
Go outside.
Bummer.
May I come in?
Whoa, fried 'taters!
Mmm!
Sorry, Olga.
Hm.
Just got badly sick.
I was standing at death's door.
- Nurses save you?
- Hm.
Mm, mm.
I was just thinking, "Why stay?
Why stay here?"
Come on, you could come
to Kiev with me. Hm?
- Baby, wait.
- Don't.
Olga, hey.
Come with me. We'll put
out fires together with Alex.
I prepared dinner.
We waited for you.
I lied to my friends.
Said I didn't
want to work here.
Not true.
Truth is, I just wanna' be
with you.
I don't want to hear
your lies.
Olga, I believe that
we can be good.
I choose.
I choose you.
It sounds so promising.
Doesn't it?
What are you saying?
Baby, please.
We can apply for our
own apartment in Kiev.
That won't ever happen.
Just leave us alone.
The choice is also the boy's.
It's really perfect
where we are.
I'll never lose you.
Ever.
Not this time.
Now, I would like you
to please get out.
Yeah, sure.
Farewell.
Please go, please.
Please!
It's perfect! We can see
everything from here.
Come closer!
Come on, guys.
Whoa.
Get your camera.
It's too dark out here
to film.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
I hope our folks
don't find out that
we lied to them
about going night fishing.
Why should they?
We go fishing all the time.
It's good.
- Uh. I can do better.
- Uh-huh.
A fireball.
Oh, my God.
Wait for me!
Hey, wait up!
Hey, you guys!
Wait!
I can't get through.
- What are you doing up at five?
- They took everyone away.
And what have you been up
to? Out getting drunk?
- Wait, what happened?
- There's a fire at the station.
- They disconnected the phones.
- Mm-hmm.
Son-of-a-bitch.
I'm outta here.
Stop!
Stop!
I'm a fireman.
You got a spare suit?
- That's the reactor, huh?
- Glory of the Soviets.
You from here?
Why is the forest all red?
Hurry!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go!
Water! Water!
I need water over here!
At the smoke!
At the smoke!
- Water! Water upfront!
- Move, move, move!
Yes, sir, Commander!
- My team?
- You local?!
- Yes, sir.
- You guys are on the other side.
Yeah.
Come on! Come on!
Bring that hose over here!
Let's move it! Go!
More water, more, more!!
Tigran?!
Tigran?!
More pressure.
Come on, let's do it.
Tigran? Tigran!
Where are we?
Over there.
Maybe first to arrive here.
The fire's out.
Hey you!
Stay closer together.
What are you
doing here?
I held the explosion back down
from the roof up there.
The light was something
I've never observed
before in my whole life.
It felt like it knew
how to survive.
You're de... You're delirious.
The reactor exploded.
Are you crazy?
Explosion?
It's okay.
It's okay.
- Agh.
- Go, go, go, go, go!
Where are they?
Help is coming. Okay.
Hang on... Hang on.
Hey! Medic!
Here, hurry! Over here!!
There, focus your spray there!!
Take him.
Come on!
Use the blockade.
Keep it under control.
Careful, careful.
Get him outta here.
- Lift! Ready!
- Get him to the ambulance, quick!
- Move it!
- Go, go, go, go!
Hold the pressure!
Yuri!!!
Kondratyuk!
It's okay... You just rest.
Okay. Okay. Breathe.
Help is coming.
Okay.
You'll be fine.
Help is coming.
- Kondratyuk!!!
- Sergey! Sergey!
You're here.
We've got to go up.
Yuri's on the roof.
Let's move.
Move, move, move!
Hey, gimme,
gimme your tank. Come on.
- You okay?
- Up there.
Asphalt burns.
Sergey, wait here.
Yuri!!
You there?!
Yuri, get up.
My face is all burned.
Get up, get up, get up
Come on, get up!!
I gotcha.
I gotcha, Yuri.
Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's get outta here!
Agh!
Okay. Okay.
Come on, come on.
Atta boy!
Come on!
Come on.
Okay.
Okay.
Come on. Come on.
Okay.
Sergey, Sergey.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Agh!
Hang in there...
Medic!
Medic!
All right.
All right.
Agh!
Sergey, Sergey,
Sergey, I'm here.
Get up!
Get up!
Come on. Breathe!
Get up!!
You're a big guy!
Guys!!!
Come here quick!!
We need more here!!
Over here!
Boys, we're here to take
only the severe cases!
Who's vomiting?!
We've already
seen them already.
Uh, al... Already seen
them yeah... Yeah, seen.
Load them in!
Get in.
We already helped... Already.
...said something...
We should probably
take them with us...
I have to get them
to the hospital...
Lyuda, hurry up; I have
to get them to the hospital!
Lots more...
more coming!
- Take me with you.
- No, we're full. Go!
- They're... they're my brigade!
- We've got to go now!
Wait, wait.
Please take me with you.
We can only take critical.
Let's go!
We have to get
to the hospital.
- We have to go now!!
- Take me too... Just take me.
Please just drive!
- Can you drive?
- Yeah.
Get in.
Move over.
He's not breathing.
Keep going!
Don't stop!
He's all swollen.
Hold him.
- Keep it steady!
- Yeah!
How is he?
Doing good.
Go.
Kick it!!
Be careful!
Hold on.
Keep him steady!
Stay up, stay up, stay up!
Get him out.
Put him in ward three!
- Where to? There.
- Ward three is full.
- Are we ready? - Get ready!
- I can't see anything.
- Patients, we need the rope.
- Give me the...
Get to the clean station.
Cleaner.
Cleaner.
Go down the wall.
Kristina, we need
those supplies at once.
Give him a shot.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
There are more patients
coming in.
Throw your clothes
on the floor.
Please make way.
Go down the hall.
Come on, guys.
Let's move.
Come on.
There's another
ambulance out there.
We need our cleaner
in the dressing room.
- Now.
- Outside.
Have they all
been injected?
Take everything off now.
Hurry.
Kristina, diazepam.
- What's up?
- A sedative to calm you down.
- To Ward Two.
- There's no room.
- Then to four.
- Four is full, too.
It's free now.
Shinkarenko didn't make it.
They just took him out.
We have to get these
dirty clothes out of here now.
Take your clothes off
and get ready for the shot.
There's too many
of them.
Come on in here.
Hurry up please.
We simply cannot
handle this much.
Yeah,
bring it down this way.
I got it.
Lie down.
Alexey, wake up.
Wake up.
Wake up, Alexey.
Alexey?
Get up.
Alexey Karpushin?
- How long was I asleep?
- A long time from the sedative.
Nauseous?
Hm?
- Maybe...
- Maybe you're good?
Yeah?
Alright.
It's better.
Alexey, I'm Dina.
Radiologist from Kiev.
I'm here just to help you.
We have some
fresh clothes for you.
Please get dressed.
I'll wait there for you.
- Kolya?
- Go.
Go!
Kolya!
- Kolya!
- It's dangerous for you to be here.
You need to let me in.
I need to be in there.
Ma'am.
It's dangerous.
You're not allowed
to be here!
Step away
from the window.
You'll get us in trouble.
Sasha!
Prihodko!
- What's going on?
- You're contaminated.
With what?
Radiation.
Reactions do vary.
Some die in minutes.
Some others, can manage.
You were only exposed
a little bit.
- Dirty clothes in the fire.
- Down in the basement?
If you just arrived,
leave your clothes by the door!
- Karpushin.
- Hold on a minute.
- Alexey Karpushin?
- Yeah, why you're asking?
From the
reactor service?
Chief in the sixth brigade.
The corridors
are familiar to you?
- Sure are.
- Ever scuba-dived?
Only with a mask.
I see. I see.
You're coming with us...
No, I quit the service here
and I'm a Kiev officer.
You're coming to help us.
About your transfer,
we'll discuss it.
Please be patient now
and wait outside the door.
You can stay.
Continue.
The kids
are all outside...
There's no easy way
around it.
Comrade Stysin, we're
the last. Now we can start.
Hello, Karpushin.
I'm Mikhail; this is Ivan.
We're the commission
for containing the incident.
- Please, sit.
- Valery, how's Sergey?
In Kiev, barely making it.
Comrades, I would
like to apologize
for not telling you
sooner about this.
I'll fill you in now.
Ivan, the video.
This hole between the third
and fourth units
is the crater left
by the explosion.
The reactor is in
a sub-critical state.
All these bright spots
are burning reactor fuel.
Temperatures could increase
to the point where it melts
through the floor of the reactor
and through the concrete below.
Coolant reservoirs are directly
underneath the reactor.
As you all know, if enough fuel
burns through and gets
to the water,
there will be a steam explosion
full of radioactive material.
The contamination if
uncontained will spread to Kiev,
Moscow, and even all
of western Europe.
Right, so we have
to get the water out.
Your departments have staff
who are intimately familiar
with the corridors
beneath the reactor.
Comrade Kostenko is
from water management,
Comrade Maksimov is
from electrical services,
Valery Goncharuk deals
with the cooling systems,
and Karpushin is
from the fire service.
Colonel Bobylin
assists the operation.
Comrades, we need you
to recommend staff
from your departments who
are familiar with the reactor
and its corridors
to open the sluice gates.
And hold them.
How do you intend
to dispose of the water
when water management
is destroyed?
The control panel is buried.
It is possible by going
through the pipe corridor
and opening it by hand.
There it's flooded
with hot water.
That's why we'll be
working in diving gear.
We'll provide training
beforehand.
If the server is flooded,
it'll take a half an hour
to open it.
Two people working
together can do it
in under eight minutes.
Let me get this straight.
You want us to volunteer
our own people
and send them to boil
for eight minutes?
The volunteers
will receive payment.
We also have an airplane
ready to take them
to Switzerland for treatment in
a specialized radiation clinic.
The most outstanding volunteers
will get apartments in Moscow.
Guaranteed from
the General Secretary.
Paid!
What if the servo
motor isn't flooded?
May we add direct power?
You'll need the nearest
junction box
in case there might
be breaks in the cables.
Here's the box, but I don't
know how to get to it.
We only go down there once
a year, with special guides.
Ivan, corridor map?
This is what we know
about the radiation levels.
- The colored areas.
- Right...
The levels in the corridors
on the western side
are lower than
the conduit corridors,
and there should be less water.
Too many things we don't know.
What if the servo is flooded?
So you'd rather
send inexperienced
workers to dive in murky water?
Can you actually guarantee
your plan will work?
No.
But everyone we send
down there
will get irradiated for sure.
There's no doubt about that.
We're not gonna remain
down there.
The water is 132;
it's bearable for us.
And it's only one hundred yards.
All we need from you
people are who can show us
which valves to turn,
then they can go.
It'd be safest
to enter on Level 7.
By the time we're through
with this labyrinth of discussion,
the water will approach
158 degrees
and then no one will want to go
swimming in that, not a soul.
- Can we move on to the pool now?
- Yep.
Yes, sir.
Follow me.
Nikita, let's hear it.
We stayed under
for twelve minutes,
but the temperature right now
is 124 degrees.
Soon it will reach 132 degrees.
As you were.
As you can see, we're
preparing thoroughly,
but without your help
to know which valve to open,
we'll be lost.
There are miles of pipes
in murky water down there.
We won't have a clue
what to do.
Have you ever dived
in hot water?
We know about extreme heat.
We're talking dirty water
in a confined space,
not in a clean swimming pool.
All your engineers
just won't cut it.
Then we'll train them, here.
You'll just give
your own guys hyperthermia,
and no one will make it
to the reactor.
I'm... not gonna order
my people to do this.
There's just no way.
Comrades, this is out
of the ordinary.
It's a matter of life
or death if we don't.
I'm sorry but my men
don't know those corridors.
There's no electricity,
and not enough people.
I won't order my men to perform
this task either. No.
If you decide to go in...
I'll go.
Me too.
Comrade Tropin,
we'll go in at Level 7.
We have no authority
to order it.
Do you really want to risk
the citizens of Kiev
getting ready
for the May Day celebration?
Okay.
Move on in.
We'll go to the seventh level.
Will the fire service help?
Well I just saw nearly
all my men in the hospital
and they're all outta comission.
And I sure as hell won't start
sending them all back now.
No fucking way.
Didn't you swear an oath
to protect your own country
giving your own life
to protect the innocent?
Alright, let's choose
the route together now.
"Attention! Attention!
Attention! Attention!
Dear comrades, the people's
city council informs you
that due to an incident at the
Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant,
there is an adverse
radioactive situation
in the city of Pripyat.
Soviet and party officials,
as well as the military,
are taking all
necessary measures.
Nonetheless,
in order to ensure
the safety of townspeople,
especially children,
it is necessary
to evacuate safely.
Help others.
Keep family members close while
you look out for your neighbors,
especially the elderly.
There may be some
who need your help.
Contact an official
for further information.
...As fast as I can.
Watch it... ow!
Sorry.
Olga?!
Olga?!
- Olga!
- Alex is really sick.
- Hey, Jackie Chan.
- Hi.
He's grim.
He needs help. Real bad.
We're going.
- To the hospital?
- No.
The hospital
is all filled up.
Children are there just crying.
There's talk of miscarriages.
Miscarriages, do you understand?
The police have
closed the hospital.
So...
Hey, how you feeling?
I saw a glow when it exploded.
Did anyone die?
No, no... no one died.
It was just a regular fire...
Are you my papa?
No, no, I'm not.
...Especially children.
It is necessary
to evacuate safely.
Help others.
Keep family members close while
you look out for your neighbors,
especially the elderly.
There may be someone
who needs your help.
Your mom said that?
Contact an official
for further information...
I'll talk about this later
with you, dear.
Get up.
You're strong.
I'm not going anywhere.
We have to go.
Hurry. Come on.
We're never coming back?
We will.
Of course we will.
You're lying.
You're lying!
- Get the bag.
- My camera!
I'm not going anywhere!
Let me go! I don't wanna!
I'm not going.
Olga, let me help.
- Mary!
- You can't take animals.
I'm sorry these are the rules.
They cannot get on the bus.
But it's my dog!
Dad, tell him!
Sweetie, I'll take him home,
and we'll come back later.
- Give me the key!
- Don't lock him in!
- We have a sick child.
- The doctors are there.
- Olga, come on.
- It's okay.
Alex.
This way.
Don't worry.
It's okay.
- I don't feel well.
- I've got you.
Olga, there's
the ambulance.
Sorry, it's an emergency.
Sorry, excuse me.
He's sick.
- Let's see his throat?
- He's sick.
- Vomit?
- Yeah, yesterday.
Everyone with
radiation sickness
goes to the hospital in Kiev.
Just look at him.
The boy can't even see straight.
You'll have to discuss
that in Kiev. Name?
- You can't just do that here!
- Will you tell me your name?
Savostina, Olga.
Savostin, Alexey.
Can we have a quick
word together, huh?
- Keep your hands off me.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.
I said, "Hands off."
You see what's going on here?
Everyone's being evacuated.
You get it? Your name?
- Savostin.
- Savostin.
- Get on the bus.
- Let's go.
Isn't she beautiful
in a pink dress?
Yeah.
Mom, I want off the bus now.
Oh baby, just hold
on, just hold on.
- Mom...
- It's alright.
Oh God, what's wrong with him?!
What's happening?
The hospital in Kiev
will help us.
They have medicine.
I promise.
Stop.
Stop promising!
They're transporting us
like cattle to god-knows-where.
Stop lying!
I'm not lying,
I'm just trying to help you.
- I owe you...
- You don't.
- You don't owe us anything.
- Mom, why are you yelling now?
Please, forgive me...
I can't lose you.
Three hundred rubles.
I'm gonna go and arrange
for his treatment; you'll see.
I have to get off the bus.
Hang in there.
You'll be good soon.
Pardon me, sir.
This man came to the checkpoint,
says he wants to volunteer,
- wants to pump some water.
- Alexey Karpushin, fire service.
I know you.
I was at the meeting.
I came here to help out.
Oleg, here's Frolov.
Captain, thanks for your help.
We'll take it from here.
You just missed them.
They left for the third reactor
to check the route.
You can go with the second group
if the first group fails.
If you like.
Why can't I go with the first?
You must be joking, yeah?
I need to join that group
if it's at all possible.
Alright. Wait here.
They'll be back later.
- Let me go join them.
- Like I said, they'll return.
Can you at least show me
their route?
- On the board.
- This one?
- Yeah.
- I'll be there in an hour.
I can't understand
these blueprints.
Do you maybe have
a fire evacuation plan?
To the left.
- Through Level 7?
- Yeah.
We can cut
through here...
heading through the letdown
heat exchanger.
You wanna' cut
through reinforced concrete?
There used to be a staircase,
but they took it out
and left a metal sheet
- over the hole there.
- What?
- This here?
- Yeah, this.
But no one's ever said that...
They've only been here
since the plant opened,
but I've been here
since it's construction.
Take me there, and I'll be able
to show it to you.
Marchenko, helicopter.
Mikhail... Mikhail,
there's a shorter route.
Show us.
- Valery.
- Hi.
Here. We can cut
through it and shorten the route.
Mikhail, this new route is
about five hundred feet shorter.
Why isn't this
in the blueprints?
These designs were
thoroughly verified,
but a lot was changed, for sure.
Mm-hmm.
Good for us then.
Mikhail, wait.
The fireman stays back.
We can be thankful
for his information,
but there, we need reliable men.
You're
with the first group.
What are you here,
for the reward?
It's my job.
- I guess we'll see then.
- Mm-hmm.
Savostina?
Call from Pripyat.
- Hello?
- Olga...
There you are.
I found you finally.
- How's the boy?
- They took Alex away.
And they're not
telling me anything.
Listen.
Everything will be fine.
I'm arranging
for the best treatment,
and then we'll all go to live
by the sea, like you wanted.
- Olga? Olga?
- Don't call again.
- Olga? Hello?
- Please, no more.
Hello, Ol?
Olga!
- Mikhail, can I ask a favor?
- Okay?
My son isn't doing well.
Maybe he can get some sort
of special treatment...
Hey, Tropin.
Alexey has a condition
if he's going to be
going to the reactor.
- Condition? What condition?
- Not a condition, a favor, sir.
My son was near the explosion
when it happened.
Uh-huh.
I thought maybe he could go
to Switzerland for treatment?
You know, that list
is actually confirmed
only by the
General Secretary.
Only the names
of the liquidators.
Surely it's not gonna cause
any big problems
to have an extra
name on the list
if it saves lives
in the city of Kiev?
You hardly understand
the real system of bureaucracy.
It's not that simple.
Okay, so my son
will go to Switzerland
and I'll go to Moscow or Kiev.
We agreed?
Alright, I'll do
this favor for you.
- Excuse me...
- Yes?
Show me your
credentials, please.
Your ID.
Mm-hmm.
I know now.
I know.
Here, I've got some masks
for you.
There's not much water.
But you might need to dive.
If you encounter radiation,
go back.
We'll manage.
Ivan, take us
through the drill.
Make it to the first
mark, then cut through the floor,
and continue to the junction box
where the servo
is connected.
Hook up your cable and wait.
We'll power it up
in exactly 20 minutes.
- Alright? Synchronize.
- Mm-hmm.
Alexey, I found out about Alex.
He was definitely exposed
too heavily to radiation
but there's a good chance that with
treatment in Switzerland, he'll recover.
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.
Just do your job well,
and we'll take care.
- Suit up.
- Let's roll out.
Nikita, let's go.
Which branch
of the Army are you?
- Intelligence.
- No way!
We got that many enemies?
- You got a tough boss.
- Oh, yeah. Hold the reel.
This is it.
We'll get right through here.
Levels?
Could be worse.
The stairs are six feet
from here.
There can't be any steam
left in the pipes.
So what's that?
Water must be getting
in from above somewhere.
The reactor's still hot.
- Alex, let's close these!
- Yeah.
Niki, let's go!
- Shit.
- Get down!! Niki, get down!!
Get him up.
Here.
Set him down.
- You must head out.
- I'm fine. I'll continue.
- No, wait here. We'll hurry.
- I can do it. I can!
Don't be stupid.
Wait here.
We'll hurry.
Nikita, we'll hurry back.
Okay?
Okay.
Ready?
Valery, what's wrong?
I'm not going
any further.
You can't force me.
- We need you, Val.
- I won't go.
Speak with me now.
Breathe.
Just breathe.
Catch your breath.
We'll talk.
I can't go!
I can't go... ugh!
My kids are in Kiev,
preparing for May Day,
so drop this
"I can't go" bullshit!
- I'm... I'm so... I'm sorry...
- Valery...
- I'm sorry...
- Get a hold of yourself.
- Let go.
- Listen to me.
- I said let go of me!!
- Look at me!
Look at me. Look at me.
Breathe. In. And out.
Come on, come on. Breathe.
And out. Breathe. And out.
That's it, good. Calm down.
Good, good, good. Good.
You think
I'm not scared?
Think Yuri Gagarin wasn't?
They never showed us how
he pissed in his spacesuit.
Listen, Valery.
When we're done,
we'll go for an official
lap of honor
around the Red Square, right?
Like Korolyov and Gagarin did.
You know how many women
they had, huh?
- No.
- They had so many women.
You're nuts, Alex.
Sergey died in Kiev alone.
Valery, I'm not gonna die now.
I still have plans and dreams.
You think I'm not scared
to go into that shit?
I can't move my legs.
Let's help you up then, huh?
Come on, come on.
Come on. Alright.
It's boiling...
- Oh, the cable!
- Is it there?!
Looks like it,
but the reel fell down.
I'm dizzy.
- How many?
- Five. I can't...
- There! I got it.
- Okay. Let me help...
Boris, you're scalding hot.
You okay?
Six minutes.
- Val, the light.
- Uh-huh.
Give it to me.
There it is.
It's hot but doable.
The water's unbearable.
Boris, listen, why don't you
keep track of the time?
I'll take Val to the box.
And he'll hook up the cable.
- Can you do it?
- Maybe.
Maybe?
Yeah.
Three minutes.
Ninety seconds, Valery!
Good.
Disconnect the breaker.
Done.
- Okay?
- I'm good. Keep going.
Connecting the cable
to the breaker...
A minute!
One.
...and two.
Turning the switch.
And the breaker.
31... 30...
I'm done.
Let's go!
Okay, okay, I'm good.
Okay. Okay.
Come on.
Hah!
It worked!
- Oh my God. Holy shit, Val!
- Hush. Sh, sh...
- It actually worked.
- Be quiet. Listen.
- Well?
- We got it!
We really did it!!
It's on!
Colonel, we did it!
We did it.
We go manual.
It didn't work.
Could we
hotwire it again?
No.
They already sent the power.
Wait.
The cable fell...
- No, no, it's... just come on!
- The cable fell. The cable fell!
That's not it!
We have to open manual.
We do it by hand.
Come on.
We're goin' to the valve.
- Let's go, guys.
- Boris!
We'll open the valve
by hand.
Boris.
Val, go get him.
- Get him.
- We can do it.
- Boris?
- Together, we can do it.
Where's Nikita?
Nikita's gone.
- Forgot my flashlight.
- Niki's gone!
- I'll get it.
- Hurry back!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Almost there.
You hear that?
What?
Water.
There.
Boris, calm down.
We'll be out of here soon.
But this corridor goes there.
Move it.
Boris, wait!
Stop!
Boris, stop!
Boris, stop!
Ah!
- Alex, you okay?
- Go get him.
Boris!
Damnit.
Boris!
Boris, stop!
Boris, will you please stop?!
Stop!
You're too close!
You're too close.
Wait!!
That must be it.
Stop!!
Boris!!
There's light!!!
I found it! The light!
I can see the light!!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Close that damn door!
Be careful!
Boris. Come on.
Alex! Alex!
Alex!
Come on...
There's Mom...
Mama's waiting.
She's waiting.
Come on.
Nikita...
Where's Nikita?
- Get their clothes off and decontaminate!
- Where's Mama?
Water. Water.
There's water.
Mikhail.
Mikhail.
Let's go back.
We need to open the valve.
There is a lot of water
down there.
Take it easy now, Valery.
You've done your job well.
Call the helicopter.
You're fine, you're fine.
You'll all be okay.
It's fine.
I have to get
them ready too.
- Boris got how much?
- 700 REM, or more.
They're sending
liquidators to continue the work.
How many to coordinate
these men?
Comrade Stysin...
Let's go...
Where to?
We're only doing a little
talk right now.
You'll listen.
We'll reprimand you.
I won't be listening.
Maybe you did have
a better plan,
but all that really amounted
to was to throw
a bunch of people
into the reactor.
We should have known.
You started constructing
the damn reactor
without even thinking of the
potential dangers for the world.
We end up paying
for our weaknesses.
That's exactly
what I'll tell them.
You should just
mind your own affairs.
Who are you fighting?
Bureaucracy?
The system?
It's just like radiation.
If you stand up to it,
you'll see it will break
you down even more.
Have you forgotten about that?
I am a product...
of the Soviet machine.
Let 'em go.
How do you feel?
- I'm alright.
- Back to bed.
- How's Nikita?
- He's alright.
Doctor, I'd like to talk
with Alexey if that's alright.
- Okay. Five minutes.
- Thank you.
- Your mom?
- Mm-hmm.
Why is she crying?
You're alive.
I'm going back down.
You won't survive again.
Mm.
There aren't enough volunteers.
There's some soldiers.
Mm-hmm.
They don't have a choice.
Oh, yeah.
They don't have any choice.
You really sure about this?
About going back in?
Pump might work.
Hm, maybe so.
Maybe not.
So they're still gonna try it
even though we know it'll explode.
Well, I'll, um, probably go.
You're done.
Next.
Hey, Olga.
It's okay.
Calm down.
Why did you leave us?!
Why the hell did you leave us?!
Why?!
I can't see him.
They won't let me see him.
I'm cutting hair now;
it's just stupid here.
I promise to you and to him...
we'll get him help.
There's a plane to Switzerland.
What?
What plane?
I got him a seat on a flight.
There's help in Switzerland?
They have
radiation specialists there
that they don't have
here in the Soviet Union.
So, he'll be alright.
So I swear to you,
we're gonna get him...
we'll get him on that airplane.
- Go, go, go, go!
- Go, go!
I got it from here.
Oh, my baby, I'm sorry.
They wouldn't let me see you...
Alex. You'll be riding in
style, just like a star.
Don't be scared, sweetie.
Just get better, alright?
- Alexey Savostin?
- Yeah. That's our boy.
Documents please from your boy
and say goodbye for-now.
Will there be any doctors there
who speak Russian?
I'm going with him.
- I love you, sweetie.
- I'm going alone?
Honey, they...
I can't go with you.
Mom, don't leave me.
Olga...
Mom!
He'll be fine.
Olga, sit down.
We don't have
the hospital's number.
I do.
We'll call him every day.
You've done everything
you could have.
When he returns,
he needs you strong.
You're right.
I will be.
I made a promise.
Forgive me; I should have
told you sooner.
I'm sorry, too.
Alex...
Alex...
I can't.
Today the people of the Soviet
Union are celebrating May Day.
They are full
of creative goals,
and they are brimming with the
energy brought by the Spring.
The festivities are being held on
the city's main road, Khreshchatyk.
Hundreds of thousands of people
are glowing
with the fullness of...
Alex?
Alex?
- I'm glad you agreed.
- Mm-hmm.
I wish I could say
the same to you.
Looks like we'll miss our
victory lap on Red Square.
Whatever.
It's a shame Boris missed
this touching moment, huh?
At least he can't
talk underwater.
Careful.
140 degrees,
like they said.
Valery, since there's
nobody else here...
why did all this really happen?
People.
What people exactly?
Does it really matter?
Are you ready?
What's wrong?
I'm not scared.
I just can't control my hands.
- I'll turn. I'll turn it myself.
- It's too hot.
One second.
I can't take it.
It's too fucking hot!
- Mm!
- Again!
Unhook me!
I can't!
Unhook me!
Ivan, the water's draining!
The water,
they drained it.
When the water drained,
they found him almost dead.
How's this?
It's good.
Why is he not in Kiev now?
Three hours on the open road
won't help him at all.
Pay attention.
Hold your distance
because he's radioactive.
It could be dangerous.
