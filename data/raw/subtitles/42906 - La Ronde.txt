...and me
Who am I in this story?
"La ronde"?
The author?
The announcer?
A passer-by?
I am you.
In fact, anyone among you.
I am the personification
of your desire...
of your desire
to know everything.
People always know
only one side of reality.
And why?
Because they see only
one side of things.
But I see every aspect
because I see
from every side
that allows me to be
everywhere at the same time.
Everywhere!
But where are we?
On a stage?
In a studio?
It is hard to say.
In a street?
Oh! We are in Vienna.
In 1900.
Let us change costume.
1900.
We are in the past.
I adore the past.
It is much more
restful than the present
and so much more
reliable than the future.
The sun's out
and its spring!
The fragance in
the air tells you
that this is going
to be a story about love.
What do we need for love
to begin its merry-go-round?
A waltz.
There! A waltz!.
The waltz turns.
The carousel turns.
So the merry-go-round
of love can turn too.
Waltz and turn
All you dear friends
Just as the earth
Turns night and day
Fallen rain drops
Turn into clouds
And then return to us as rain
Honest women or tender lasses
Aristocrats, or soldiers proud
When love's coming to surprise them
They all dance to the same tune
The merry-go-round now is starting
It is the hour of the fading day
There she is, the girl is coming
And our story begins with her...
Handsome, want to come?
- Thanks, you're mistaken, my lady.
My lady?
Making fun of me?
- I don't make fun of anyone.
Are you coming, or not?
- I'm not in the play.
The play?
- I manage this merry-go-round.
You understand?
It will begn with you.
Go to that street corner, please.
Do you hear that?
Yes. They are soldiers.
Again more soldiers.
- There are always soldiers.
The sixth is yours.
He'll be like the others.
- In a while. He'll take you.
The Girl and the Soldier.
Dont you want to come?
Dont you want to come?
You meant me?
- Who else?
I live nearby.
Come warm yourself.
I must return to the barracks.
It is too early for that.
Come with me, it is cozier.
- Theres no doubt!- Hush.
There are some chicks around.
- Are you joking?
Chicks get their heads cut off!
- You like a brawl?
A bit.
Come with me.
- I have no money.
I don't need any money.
- Are you Rothschild's daughter?
No, but only civilians
have to pay up.
For lads like you it's free.
Free?
You must be the one Michel met!
I don't know any Michel.
- Remember, the Schiffsgasse Café.
I have picked up
quite a few there.
Lets go, but hurry!
Now that it's free, you are in a hurry.
At least put your
arm around me.
- It's better with
a little passion.
Have you been in the service long?
Think I'll tell you my life now?
Where do you live?
A good ten minutes from here.
You had said nearby!
Thats not far
if you like someone!
I like you,
but it is too far.
So listen. Come see me tomorrow
after you leave the barracks.
Well, give me your adress.
No. You wouldnt come.
- I'm telling you, I will!
If my place is too far...
...come over here.
You do know a few tricks!
Were are we?
We won't be disturbed.
I dont like it here.
- Al like it everywhere.
We're losing time.
Watch the water. Its deep around here
That's the suicide area.
You're funny!
- Down there we'll find a bench.
We don't need a bench.
I'd like a guy like you.
I've got a jealous temper.
This is my first disguise.
Enough of that music!
Who's that? -Never saw him.
For sure he re-upped
Where's Franz?
He has my spurs
Franz is still busy.
This is being drawn out
a bit too long.
Don't run away like that!
- I'll get locked up!
Tell me your name, at least.
- What would that change?
Mine is Léocadie.
- That's some funny name!
Do you have a cigarette
to say goodbye?
No, I don't have any more.
I have to run.
Good night
What a lovely night it would
be if they were all like this!
You stingy... Bastard!
Look at him run!
One minute longer and the
merry-go-round would have stopped.
Hurry, or you'll get it.
What would you care?
I want you to go out on Saturday,
my sweet friend. Go.
Run now!
To the barracks
Returns the soldier
But he'll be out on Saturday
With every waltz another partner
And he'll meet Marie that day.
And to think that the first
time I didn't want to.
What can I do?
You're so cute!
Miss Marie,
you are the loveliest, tonight.
So you have checked them all?
While dancing one compares.
And you like to compare.
You danced with that funny
blonde more than with me.
Do you think so?
- Five times.
I counted. And yet I thought...
- What?
...how strange that he likes to dance
with that funny girl so much.
She's a relative of a friend.
The corporal with the moustache?
- No, the civilian with the broken voice.
It doesn't prove anything.
It does for me. You don't know me.
Should we sit on that bench?
Oh, no. It is too dark here.
Don't fear, I'm with you.
- That's just it.
Let's drop the Mister and Miss.
It is so much friendlier.
We don't know each
other long enough.
There are some married people
who know each other less.
Look, there's a bench.
We won!
- Sorry.
No, please.
Here's another bench.
Let's sit, you and me.
You'll be sensible, Franz?
You promise?
You promise?
Hey, old man!
Pardom me, Sir.
- What happens?
I have forgotten
my saber on the bench.
Here it is.
And remember, a soldier should
never leave his saber.
I only left it for fifteen minutes.
- Not even for fifteen minutes!
A saber is a saber.
Don't let me catch you again!
How authoritative you are!
- That's how you deal with men.
And with pretty women...
This saber!
What are you doing?
- Hooking up my saber.
What did he do?
- You're a naughty boy.
Do you love me?
- Of course.
Where are you running?
- We are going back.
Where?
- Over there.
There is no more reason to trail
about the park now.
Is it true that you love me?
- I hear music.
You still want to dance.
- Why not?
I must go back now.
They'll catch me.
My mistress won't let me
go out.
If you have to go back, that's it.
I thought you would see me home?
Do you want me to walk you home?
It's sad to walk all alone.
- Sure.
And where is the house?
In the Porzellangasse.
That's along my way.
But I don't want to go back now.
I still want to have fun.
I have to be back by midnight.
I understand very well.
Now's the turn
of that funny blonde.
I don't think she's all
that funny.
Men are disgusting.
I beg you, don't dance
any more tonight.
Stay with me
a little more.
If you want to wait, have a seat.
I'll come and get you in a while.
Waiter, a beer for Madame.
I'm not dancing
any more tonight.
I don't know you.
Who are you
- Nobody.
Nobody in particular.
What do you want?
To invite you for a little walk.
But I have to go back.
- Yes indeed...
.. but you will be thrown out, because
you had no permission to go out.
I'll have to find
another place.
You will find it.
Trust me.
Thsi place or another,
what's the difference?
And I know that in two months from now
fate will be very kind to you.
Where have you taken me?
Where are we?
We are taking
a walk through time.
Two months!
July's far away!.
- Not at all.
You are there already.
Look at yourself.
- It's true.
There's the house.
Go up the stairs.
That's your new place.
Yes, but Sir, are you sure?
- Of course.
Of course, I'm sure.
Courage!
You are not going to leave me alone?
- I have to,
but don't worry.
Your soldier will be kinder.
Goodbye!
Let's hope it won't be too late.
Waltz and turn
All you dear friends
He's the one who loves you now
But your heart is a bit flighty
Another lover makes his bow
Another lover
The Maid and the Young Man
Dear Miss Marie,
"I received your new adress.
"I'm glad your new
emloyers are kind.
"But how old is their son?
"I saw you yesterday while
returning from maneuvers.
"You didn't answer my wave.
Was it on purpose
or didn't you see me?"
"Dear Mister Franz,
"I have time to write
this afternoon.
"Monsieur and Madame
are in the country.
"Your letter
gave me real pleasure.
"But how old is their son?"
Come in.
Did Monsieur ring?
Yes, I rang.
Yes. What did
I want to ask?
Would you put the blinds down?
That way it will be less hot.
You really have courage
to work in such weather.
Bring me a glass of water.
Yes, Monsieur Alfred.
Let it run to get cool, please.
Thank you.
Careful, you are trembling!
What time could it be?
Nearly five.
Already?
Well, thank you.
Did I hear the doorbell?
No, Sir.
Are you awaiting someone?
Yes, Professor Schueller.
The gentleman with the beard
who came the other day?
He comes twice a week.
He'll be here at five.
He gives me French lesson.
What time is it?
A quarter to five, Sir.
He's allways a little late.
Come.
Closer.
No, I thought...
Throught what?
Nothing. It is your blouse.
What about my blouse?
Don't you like it?
Yes, yes.
It is blue?
Yes, A blue blouse.
You dress very well.
Aren't you warm?
It's too light.
You are right.
It's too light.
Don't be embarrassed
because of me.
No need to be embarrassed
with anyone...
lovely as you are.
Your hair smells so good!
One night I saw you
when I came home late.
I passed by the kitchen
to get some water.
Your door was open.
I saw so many things.
Your skin is so
lovely and white.
If somebody rings the bell?
We dont answer.
Where are you going, Sir?
To the third floor.
Sorry, everyone is
in the country.
I know. But I'm here to see their son.
Hes not here, Sir.
You must be wrong. He said
he would not go with his parents.
He must have changed his mind.
He couldn't.
You think so?
But who are you?
I'm new here.
New?
I asure you there's
nobody up there.
Weird.
You can see the
shutters are closed.
You saved me
three flights of stairs.
Don't thank me, Professor.
It must continue turning.
What's turning?
"La Ronde", Professor.
La Ronde?
Yes, Professor.
I'm sure I heard the bell.
Go get it.
Go get it, Marie.
Well?
- Nothing.
He surely did not come.
That's Providence
for sure
I'm going for a walk.
I want to walk,
to breathe.
I am ten years older!
Have a good walk!
You aren't cross, are you?
Oh, no! I'm sure
to see you again.
Why do you say that?
Just like that.
See you this evening.
Sometime after
the happy beginning
Love just went to his head
Lovely love,
such a great love
For an honest woman
Waltz and turn
All your dear driends
But all his ardor is still in vain
For she valiantly resist him
And as he pleads she's off again
Perhaps flowers can convince her
Take some roses, take them red
But that's not enough to still her
Honest scrupules in her head
Just a sip of a good wine
And surrender may come sweet
But a woman with real class
Only in private drinks her glass
Off you go to find the dame
Who lets apartments so discreet
With some money to your name
It is yours
And here's the key
One nice day
Flushed with impatience
There, on time
With a new hat on his head
Brimming now with confidence
He's so happy
She promissed...
She promissed...
Wait for me.
Five minutes.
The Young Man and the Married Woman
Emma, you came!
- Close the door quickly.
Were you followed?
I hope not. I changed
carriages three times.
What folly.
How my heart's beating!
Come, sit here.
What time is it?
A quarter to six.
You are not late.
It is pleasent here.
Isn't it?
It's cozy.
Is it really yours?
Well, for the moment.
Since when?
- Some time.
Don't you want to sit down?
Yes, my legs are failing me.
Let me take this off.
You'll feel better.
You think so?
Also your veil.
Two veils.
- Two veils?
One.
Two.
Take off your hat.
You will feel better.
How lovely you are!
You are sweet.
Do you love me?
I hope you don't doubt it!
Then you will prove it
to me by letting me go.
You asked me to come. I come.
- Emma, don't be cruel.
You promised to be sensible.
- I swear I will be sensible.
- Goodbye, then.
- Emma, don't torture me.
The five minutes are over.
- Not five minutes, five seconds!
What time is it?
- I don't know.
Five minutes to six.
I should be...
...at my sister's.
- But you see her every day.
Why did I listen to you?
Emma... I have been thinking
of you so much.
I know you are unhappy
- Yes.
Life is so indifferent!
So...
So empty...
and so short.
The only joy is to meet
someone to love.
Who would have predicted that
eight days ago.
or even yesterday?
- You promised day before yesterday.
That day you turned my head.
Yesterday I gave it some thought.
I decided not to see you again.
I wrote you a long letter.
I didn't get it.
- I tore it up.
I should have sent it.
We should not see
each other again.
What is behind this door?
A room.
Yes, but what kind of room?
A drawing room.
Another drawing room.
You have two drawing rooms?
- Yes
This is a large apartment.
I'm going to ask you a question.
Do you swear to answer the truth?
Have other women been here?
But this house was
built fifty years ago!
That's not what I'm asking.
You understood very well.
Oh, but never, Emma.
I explained to you that...
To receive me, you have...
What is so bad about it?
Nothing.
My veils. One, two.
My hat.
What are you doing to me?
What time is it?
- I don't know.
I thought it was later.
Give me something to drink.
A glass of water.
Would you like a glass of water?
I'm thirsty.
Wouldn't you prefer...
- Anything.
The cork is damaged.
But I'll manage.
I wanted to tell you
that drawing room is a...
You certainly scared me!
There, that's funny!
Don't torture yourself, my darling.
- I knew it.
I was half crazy all day.
Have you read Stendhal?
Yes, Stendhal's book
"On Love".
It mentions something typical.
Some cavalry officers
tell each other their
amorous adventures and...
Do you follow me?
Their amorous adventures,
so what?
They all say
that with the woman
they wanted the most,
in fact happened...
the same thing
that happened to me.
It is quite typical, isn't it?.
Yes, quite.
To top it off,
there's only one who says
this never happened to him.
Maybe it was true?
Stendhal says he was a braggart.
I see.
Yet, I don't see why
not to believe it.
You don't know
the best of the story.
One of the cavalry officers
says that he spent,
with that woman he really wanted,
three nights, or even six.
It must have been three.
Why do you say that?
You don't know the story.
I don't, but it
must have been three.
That officer spent with that woman
he loved so much
three nights
and all they did was cry.
They cried? Both?
Yes.
Tears of joy.
Of delight in being together.
Tou do not understand that,
do you?
When one's in love,
I find that so natural.
But some don't cry?
Yes, naturally.
Thats good. Because
I thought that Stendhal said
that all cavalry officers
cried in such circumstances.
You are making fun of me.
Not at all.
My darling, don't get upset.
Now you upset me even more.
You'll worry yourself sick.
- Better and better.
I find it so nice,
just to remain good friends.
That caps it all!
I don't know what to say.
Let's not talk.
It will be symbolic.
What time is it?
It's been a while.
Where's your watch?
In my vest-pocket.
And where's your vest?
I don't know.
There.
I have to go.
It must be so terribly late.
It would have been so
nice to be good friends.
That's better.
Fixed!
It is eight o'clock!
Fortunately the coachman waited.
- You had asked him to.
- I'd said five minutes...
Right?
he knows life!
- I know the house!
See you at the party
tomorrow nihgt?
We'll dance the first waltz.
- I would never dare.
- Then over here, day after tomorrow.
You are crazy, darling.
Wont you come back again?
We will talk about it tomorrow.
Dancing the first waltz.
Now I'm the lover
of a married woman.
The Young Woman
and Her Husband.
What are you doing?
I am reading Stendhal.
- Is it a good book?
Very instructive.
What's the matter?
I should be asking you!
What's wrong?
You are very lovely now.
You have changed.
Was I ugly?
You were young.
Now you are in full bloom.
You're being a gentleman.
Business is going well.
Yes, obviously.
Husbands have worries.
Their minds arent always free.
Are you working
or talking to me?
Of course I'm working.
I am going to sleep.
Good night, darling.
Do you remember Venice?
Venice?
On our wedding trip?
Yes, it was lovely.
Switch the light on.
I want to see you.
Thanks.
I wanted to explain something.
You know...
The husbands... no its not that.
Husbands cannot
always be lovers.
There's a time for everything.
There are periods of calm,
when one lives like friends.
And there are other periods...
less calm ones.
We had several periods
of each of the two categories.
And it is good like that.
So?
- No?
I didn't say no.
I said so.
I have told you already.
Its a good arrangement.
Because if there were no calm periods
there would be no
periods of less calm.
Do you understand?
That's quite clear.
Change is principle of life.
Conjugal love is...
The marriage...
Marriage is a
diconcerting mystery.
You young women of good families,
come to us ignorant and pure.
You haven't lived
and cannot know.
But we know.
But at what price!
One could be disgusted with
love if one knew the women
of our first times.
But there's no choice.
Tell me about.
Tell me about those women.
I hope you are joking.
No. I always wanted to know
about you and those women.
No Emma. You don't realize.
It would be a desecration.
But it's all so long ago.
Have you ever been the
lover of a married woman?
What do you mean?
My question is clear.
How's such a question
coming to your mind?
Do you know a woman who...
Is married?
- Who's guilty?
How coud I know?
- Among your friends?
I don't know.
Has one confided in you?
No. None did.
Do you suspect one?
I can't even think
of one.
Truly not?
Of course.
Emma, swear to me.
You'll never befriend a woman of whom you
think that she might not be beyond reproach.
Women of doubtful reputation seek the
company of honest women
in a a kind of
nostalgie for virtue.
That's something very deep
They are longing for virtue.
They suffer their unworthiness.
You think so?
- I'm sure.
Imagine that existence
of lies and constant peril.
They pay dearly for that joy.
It's not even joy.
- Pleasure.
How can you call it pleasure?
I assume.
Otherwise, they wouldn't.
It is a dizziness.
A dizziness.
But you have taken
advantage of it.
Yes, once.
Who was she? Was it long ago?
Quite long ago.
She's dead.
Dead?
Those women die young.
Are yu sure
they all die young?
It is a fact.
There is justice.
Did you love her?
One doesn't love those women.
One can really
love only in truth
and in purity.
That's true.
That's true.
What time is it?
What difference can it make?
We have our whole live before us.
How reassuring!
Think of Venice.
Give me your hand.
The Husband
and
the little...
How would I say?
The little dressmaker?
No. That's not
a working girl.
A little hussy, then?
No. Taht she's not.
She's so sweet.
You don't understand.
I'm only a beginner.
I haven't your experience.
You have to know a bit of life.
Yes, Mr. Breitkopf.
- How come you know my name?
I served you at the Wachtls
at Mayerling.
- Ah, Mayerling!
Then you know my tastes.
You can trust me.
- What about drink?
Champagne, of course.
Shrimps... pineapple.
Why not?
She's young.
Are you thirsty?
What will you tink of me, Sir?
- Sir? why always Sir?.
That won't change anything.
What will you tink of me?
Why?
For coming with you
to a private suite.
This is a restaurant.
The waiter can come any time.
I adore shrimps.
- So, eat.
Good.
That tickles!
It is comfortable here..
It is sumptuous.
Have you ever been in
a private dining suite?
You really want to know?
Yes, I have.
Not the way you think.
With a friend and her fiancé.
It wouldn't have been
wrong even if you had gone
with a young friend.
But I don't have one.
Neither young, nor old.
I swear.
You don't want me to believe.
I haven't had
one for six month.
Who was it?
He looked like you.
Tell me!
He looked like you.
Had it not been for that...
What? You mean that is why
you answered me?
He had such a charm.
He talked the way you do.
You have the same look.
What kind of work
did he do?
What he did?
What eyes you have!
You remind me of someone,too.
Who?
My youth.
My glass is empty.
There must be some left.
How old are you?
- That doesn't matter.
But you?
Eighteen?
No, nineteen.
At last!
And you? Thirty?
Well, just about!
Thre must have been
something in that champage.
My head is turning.
I wonder what will
happen if I cannot get up.
I adore you.
What is this?
- The bill.
You have seen
that little one?
I noticed Mademoiselle
when you came.
Do you know her?
It is the first time I've seen her.
I'm wondering wheter...
I know nothing of her.
I got carried away.
You should not regret it.
Do you tihnk so?
- I know so.
May I?
Are you ready?
That bit of champagne.
What it made me do!
What will you think of me?
That you like me, that's all.
Yes, but that champagne...
- What about it?
When two people like each other
there's no need for drugs
in the champagne.
I said it to be proper.
Everyone has his bit of dignity...
and I am a bit ashamed.
Because I remind you of your first lover?
- Of course.
Was he lieutenant?
No. He's out of the service.
His father has a café.
My bag, my gloves.
Do you know what time is it?
- No. Why?
Eleven-thirty.
- So what?
And your mother?
You have seen enough of me?
- Yuo said yourself that.
I don't even know your name
- Charles.
You are not same any more.
My umbrella.
Will I see you again soon?
- I don't live in Vienna.
I only come here
from time to time.
I bet you are married.
when a men say they dont live
here it means they are married.
Would you have any remorse
for seducing a married man?
No. I'd just think his wife
is doing the same.
Don't talk like that.
It is clear that you have a wife!
- Wheter I have or not,
I find such banter
in poor taste.
Let's talk seriously.
I'd like to see you again.
- Really?
Yes, often.
But I'd have to be sure of you.
I couldn't keep an eye on you.
You know, one doesn't meet
men like you every day.
Yes, of course.
But as you are still
not naive, but quite young...
and there are individuals without scrupules
and for girls like you, temptations.
As I don't live in Vienna...
we could arrange it.
If you want to love me,
love only me.
Only you?
We could find a little nest
where I would visit you
when I come to town.
I can afford that.
DArented place, of course.
I'd have that in
a nice part of town,
everything just right,
a good house, elegant lobby,
well-waxed floors,
well-polished brass
and an impeccable stairxase.
Thre it is for our charmer
All out now the welcome mat
For she followed a young poet
More seductive than all that
Are all poets like you?
The great ones are, but we are
only a few. -You scare me.
Are you awed?
- Yes
But could you light
the other candles?
Not yet, my angel. We are bathed
in an ocen of light all day.
Now we leave the waves and we drape
shadows about us, like a wrap.
No, not like a wrap. That's
prosaic. What do you think?
Nothing.
Sublime incomprehension!
Like a wrap...
like a dressing gown...
like a cloak of stars.
Why of stars?
- Don't talk.
Above all, don't talk!
How can you write in the dark?
By the light of my thoughts.
Ocean,
light,
wave...
- Are you writing all down?
Inspiration is a good memory.
But I have no memory.
Our drama lies in the continuous
marriage of frenzy
and organization. Yes.
Frenzy and organization.
Aren't you thirsty?
No, I'm hungry.
I'd prefer you to be thirsty
- Why? I'm hungry.
There's enough to drink, not to eat.
I can buy cold cuts.
No cold cuts.
Do you want to dine
in a private suit?
Again?
It must be a mania
men have!.
Have you dined in
a suite before?
With a lover?
Precisely not. With a friend
and her fiancé. There, you see.
No, I don't see.
I don't even see
if you are blushing.
I think you are telling a lie.
By now I can't even tell
if you are blonde or dark.
You should have written it down.
What you said
is extremely deep.
You just summarized the
whole tragedy of desire.
Couldn't you talk
like everyone else?
I never tried.
Tell me if you love me.
Yes, I love you.
- Why?
You are different.
Can one see that?
One mainly hears it.
I feel that with you
love must be something.
Something...
Immaterial. Take your dress off!
I said: The night's there with itsveil,
with its stars,
it spread the whole
milky way at our feet.
A thousand stars glitter.
Take everything off.
But I'm cold.
The night bring us back 20, 30, 50 suns,
the glare of the day hid from us.
Imagine that we are in the Indies,
in a mysterious palace.
Take your slip off.
The nights are warm in the Indies.
Humidity envelops us.
Take your slip off.
Do you love me?
There you go, Sir.
The bill.
What time is it?
- Just after eleven, Sir.
I have almost midnight.
So do I.
Something must have kept her.
But it's nothing serious.
You think so?
- I know so.
"May the wind blow storm
or breeze, ice cold or warm
"Nothing matters, for together
Now in the glittering white of snow
"On we are walking
through the forest. "
Now I'll dazzle
you with a present.
I'll reveal my name.
Kuhlenkampf.
Kulenkampf?
You are astounded?
Why should I be?
It's a name like any other.
You don't know Kuhlenkampf?
Is it true you write
plays shown in theaters?
You are beauty,
simplicity, life.
You really would have loved me
even if I'd been a grocery boy?
Of course.
- Swear, please, swear.
You did not know I'm Kuhlenkampf.
I said no.
It brings tears to my eyes.
Forget everything.
I am not Kulhenkampf.
I'm Robert, and nothing more.
I'm not a writer.
I'm a notary's clerk.
At night I play piano in a café.
We'll never leave each other. We'll love
one another with imposing simplicity.
Is it true you play piano?
In what café?
No more questions.
Would you like to take a trip?
For three months or three weeks.
And your notary public?
And my mother?
They can console each other.
We'll live in the deep forest
all naked, drinking from brooks,
eating golden fruits
amidst the wilderness.
Then we'll say goodbye..
Why goodgye?
There's no love
without goodbye.
Kiss me,
and Sunday you'll see
a play by Kulhenkampf.
Kulhenkampf again!
- He's a friend.
You'll see the 50th
showing of the play.
Wait at the stage door
for me, then you tell me all.
Bravo for you.
A great audience!
The Poet
and the Actress.
Why did you drop the last line?
Always the same one.
"We'll never leave each other. We'll love
one another with imposing simplicity"
You don't say it in life.
Why did you send her away?
I wanted to kiss you.
But we'll have all night.
Do you really want to go out there,
two hours by sledge
into the night?
I wish we didn't play tomorrow.
You wanted it.
You asked me
to reserve the rooms.
And why two rooms?
One never knows
how things turn out.
Turn out?
Then let's go to my place.
By now it will be cold there.
There is not fire.
Then, your place.
What about my mother?
Then, let's go out there.
What time is it, please?
A little after eleven.
I have almost midnight.
- So do I, Miss.
Why play with me?
You are talent, beauty, life.
Because I'm an actress.
- Forget the theater for a moment.
Why forget it?
You write plays for it
and I play in it.
What would we be without it?
A man and a woman.
You think that a man and a woman
would have decided to leave now
if they were not of the theater?
You dont love me anymore.
And you?
You are right.
Theater is terrible.
We know in advance what
we'll tell each other.
You choose that hotel because
it reminds you of an old love.
You like to compare
the present and the past.
A night of memories.
What about me?
You'll send me back
twenty times.
You know I won't send you back
the twenty-first time.
Isn't true?
Yes, I know.
That is why I love you.
Those who don't know...
do you love them too?
- All of them.
Waltz and turn dear friends
Just as the earth turns
Night and day
Fallen rain drops turn into clouds
and then return to us as rain.
The Actress
and the Count
Count, it is you?
Will you excuse me a moment?
Your mother
authorized me to come in
otherwise I wouldn't dared.
- Have a seat, dear Count.
I am paying you my respects.
Yesterday I saw you play
for the first time.
Only yesterday?
We were still dining when it
started. You are even lovelier close up.
May I go back to bed?
Have a seat, dear Count.
What were we saying?
That I dined late.
You must dine earlier.
I could do that,
or not dine at all.
Dining is not a pleasure.
Wich are the pleasures
you are still enjoying?
I often wondered about that.
And love?
Those who believe
in love can find a woman.
Is that happiness?
Happiness?
Happiness does not exist.
What one talks about most
exists the least.
How true!
Drunkenness, joy, they exist.
Let's assume I feel a joy.
I know I feel it. Let's assume I'm drunk.
That's a fact.
When it is past...
It is past...
The future is unknown,
the past melancholy.
We have only the present.
Do you understand?
Come, sit closer.
Where can I put the helmet?
I knew you would come.
I realized it last night on stage.
- Last night?
Didn't you understand
I was playing only for you?
You noticed me?
Detach your saber.
No, give it to me.
Well, ask me something.
Authorize me to return tonight.
Why postpone what you can do
in the morning?
Let me tell you.
Love in the morning...
I see it differently.
How do you see it?
I'll wait you at the stage door
and we go out to dine.
- And then?
Home.
And then?
Things will follow their course.
How darling!
Isn't it too warm here?
Yes, it is.
Open that.
It's so dark. One can almost
imagine that it's night.
Nobody can see us
except for ourselves.
May I go back to bed?
Shall we say:
day after tomorrow?
Why day after tomorrow?
You said tonight.
That has no more meaning.
I mean,
morally speaking.
Morally speaking I have
to see you tonight.
I have to tell you
about our souls.
I'll be waiting
at the stage door.
Not at all.
You'll wait here.
At your place?
- In my room.
So we will not dine.
It would have no
philosophical meaning.
Very well.
I have to take leave.
Considering I came for a courtesy call,
I have taken advantage.
Glad to have met you.
My regards to your mother.
Haven't seen you before?
That's possible.
I move about a lot.
Have you served here long?
I don't serve,
I'm here for love of art.
What art?
- The art of love.
For love of the art of love.
Very funny. Goodbye.
Toward what love
are you going now?
Where did I go last night?
I didn't go to her.
I was alone.
No, with Count Bobby
in a bad state.
I didn't go to the theater.
I dined alone with Harras.
An animated dinner.
Quite a happy party followed me.
Katie, Doudou y Harras, of course.
That woman?
I didn't follow that woman,
I wanted to be by myself.
Absolutely.
What is past, is past.
Where does it leave one?
Good morning, handsome.
Sleep well?
Does it matter to you
whether one's young or old or...?
I am sleepy.
That's it!
I know who you remind me of.
I remind you of someone?
It's incredible.
The same eyes.
Incredible.
Let me kiss your eyes.
Doesn't it bother you?
What?
That we didn't...
There are many men like that.
It wasn't your moment.
I know that you like me.
Goodbye, soldier.
How do you know I like you?
Last night...
Didn't I drop on the couch?
You were on the couch,
but with me.
Don't you remember?
What do you wanted, anyway?
What about that?
Do I look more like her
than before?
Less than before.
Where does it leave one.
You know what I mean?
Doesn't one salute
officers any more?
It would have been a pity if those
two hadn't saluted one another.
The merry-go-round has stopped.
That's the end now of our story
All with me, you saw it well
It's the story of everybody
and that'all there was to tell.
