Put it near the piano.
The trunk, too?
Yes.
- Where is the piano, sir?
- To your right.
Just leave them there,
I'll take care of them later.
Jeez, this weighs a ton,
must be books.
Why didn't you use
the dolly, dummy?
'Cause you grabbed
it first, dammit.
Marco?
Marco, where are you?
Oh, there you are.
Marco, that's my name.
Come along now,
your lunch is ready.
Here I come, Mamma.
[laughs]
You've been
hiding from Mamma.
Didn't you hear me call you?
- Mamma.
- Yes, dear?
Is this my house?
Of course, it's mine,
therefore it's yours.
Are we gonna
live here forever?
Who can tell?
Now run along
and eat your lunch.
It's already in the kitchen.
[birds chirping]
Ah, there's that box
of silverware.
Anything else in the van?
Nothing much, sir.
Tony's taking care if it.
- Here's some more.
- Ah, good.
Now put them there, please.
Take this one, too.
Put 'em in the corner
by the steps there.
Yes, sir.
- What about this one?
- Yes...
[playing the piano ¶]
Hey, Rubenstein,
why don't you play something?
Uh, there's still a big case
of stuff in the hall.
- Where'll I put it?
- Oh, that'd be the dishes.
Yeah, uh... take them
to the kitchen, will you.
- Careful now, eh?
- Yes, sir, don't worry.
¶ ¶
Marco?
Is that you down there
in the cellar?
Yes, it's full
of neat old furniture.
It is, eh?
Well how do you like
your new house?
Uh, are we gonna
live here forever?
Well, that's difficult.
Some time anyway.
For the rest of our lives?
[laughs]
That depends on
how much we like it.
Why you so concerned?
Uh, only in case
anyone asks me.
Oh.
¶ ¶
Thank you again, goodbye.
- Thank you, goodbye.
- Ma'am.
Let's roll, Tony.
[truck engine starts]
Good luck, lady.
[birds chirping]
[eerie music ¶]
[box creaks]
Hey... what is this,
you're getting nervous already?
It's only me.
Seven years is a very long
time you know.
Yes, I know,
but for an instant
I had a strange sensation.
- Shh, Dora?
You're forgetting our pact.
Bruno, are you coming out
or not?
I said I'd fix up
a swing for him.
You coming too?
Oh, I have our dinner to fix.
You also promised me,
not to overwork yourself.
Look, you'll have a maid
at the end of the month.
Relax, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.
You coming?
I'll join you
in a little while.
Good.
Ah, there you are,
good boy.
Well, the first thing
we have to do
is find a strong branch.
This one here.
Yeah, it looks alright.
- Ah, it's strong enough.
- Is it?
Well you come on down
and I'll have a look.
Come on now.
Ah-ah.
Come on, let's put it up now.
- Put it up, tie it there!
- This one?
Yes, that one there.
Yeah, seems strong enough.
[laughing]
There, you like that?
[laughing]
Higher!
Hey, you've got
it up already!
Come on Marco, up we go,
up, that's a boy, up!
Oh, Mamma, look at me!
[laughing]
Oooo!
[Marco laughs]
Now it's your mother's turn.
- Oh yes.
- Yes, get on, Mamma.
Come on, Marco, push.
[laughing]
Oh, my God!
I forgot the dinner!
I hope it's alright.
That's enough for now,
come on.
Let's get there
before it burns, hurry!
Now finish your apple.
- I'm full.
- Oh, just one more bite.
Eat up.
Now that we have a garden,
can I have a dog?
A police dog,
or maybe a Collie
if it's not too big.
Can I have a dog
with long hair like Mommy's?
Well, that's flattering, ha.
Well, we'll see.
Come on it's getting late.
Long past your bedtime,
young man.
- Come on.
[groans]
Do as you're told, dear.
But I'm on vacation.
Be a good boy now, Marco,
off to bed.
You're sleeping on your feet.
Oh, shucks.
Ok, I'm going.
Night.
Night.
Mamma, can I keep
the light on?
All right, but just for tonight.
¶ ¶
[Champagne cork pops]
I could use that.
He's sleeping at last, hmm.
Good.
It's not cut crystal... anyway.
- Cheers.
- To us.
Ah, perfect.
[sighs]
I'm sorry I was
so nervous earlier.
I know it's a long time
since Carlo's suicide,
but coming back to this house
where we lived together,
is like reopening
a period of my life.
Anyway, I feel
much better now.
With you at my side,
I feel sure that's
all behind us now.
And Marco's going
to be very happy here.
Oh, you've been so good to him,
like a father.
He's very fond of you.
Maybe more of you than of me.
[laughs]
Besides it would have been silly
to have sold a house
like this so near the airport.
Why don't you give me a kiss?
[laughing]
- Again.
Where are you going this trip?
Oh... New York.
We layover in Baltimore
of all places.
You're always flying off,
just when I need you.
[piano music plays ¶]
[moaning]
Pigs!
Pigs!
Pigs!
Pigs!
[heavy breathing]
You can't catch me!
Oh yes I will!
I'm coming after you,
watch out!
[laughing]
I'm the wicked witch
of the forest.
I'm going to catch you
if you don't watch out.
And I will eat you up!
[both laughing]
There, I caught you.
Help, help!
Let me up.
[grunting]
What do you say to our
visiting the park, Marco?
Oh yeah!
I'll take you with me and no one
will be able to save you.
No you won't, you ugly ghost.
I'm a queen and my soldiers
will arrest you,
and lock you
in the old tower.
Hee, hee, hee.
No one can arrest me because
I'm a ghost, I'm invisible.
But I can see you.
Because I want you to,
but only you can see me.
Now you must obey my orders
and come away with me
to the land of darkness.
- No, no, never!
I don't want to!
Oh dear, help me somebody!
Come with me,
and you and I will reign
in the kingdom of ghosts.
I will teach you black magic.
You will ride on the wings
of a giant bat.
And a black cat will scratch
out the eyes of your enemies.
Lets go now,
this is where we came in.
- No, how horrible.
- No wait.
I want to live here
in the sunlight.
- I won't go with you.
- But doesn't it scare you?
You won't be able to sleep
tonight, hmm-hmm.
Oh, boy, it's fantastic.
[piano music ¶]
Mamma!
What's the matter, dear?
Are you tired?
Hungry?
Let's go home now.
No, it's not that.
What is it then?
Why doesn't my real daddy
ever come back to see me?
Look Marco, you're old enough
now to understand, I think.
You know your father was
a man who liked
to travel a great deal.
He loved airplanes,
ships, sailboats,
and he loved to visit
far away places.
Well, one day he went
on one of his voyages
and never came back.
Your daddy is dead, Marco.
What is death, Mamma?
Death is like going
on a trip, darling,
only one doesn't come back.
One goes away forever,
but we'll keep
daddy alive within us.
But why did he die, Mamma?
Why?
Oh, baby, it's hard
to explain.
Death is part of life and we
must learn to accept it.
You'll understand someday.
[door creaks]
[gasps]
What are you doing up
at this hour?
Mamma, can I sleep
with you tonight?
Please!
A big boy like you
and you still want
to sleep with your mamma.
- Please.
[laughs]
Alright, just
for tonight, though.
¶ ¶
[eerie music plays ¶]
[birds chirping]
Oh!
Ah, ah.
- What's the party for?
- It's not a party.
Not in the sense you mean.
Some friends
are coming to visit.
How come?
Just to get together again.
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.
I don't like them.
You don't like them?
Marco, how can you say that
if you don't even know them?
What about Bruno?
When is he coming back?
Today, I hope it'll
be a nice surprise for him.
The motors are off.
Bruno.
Hi, Marco.
[laughing]
Bruno!
Bruno!
- Bruno!
- Well big boy, how are you?
I'm fine.
You been having fun
while I was away?
Been taking care
of your mother for me?
Yes, but now that you are
here you've got to stay
with me and play
with me more often.
[laughs]
Here, this is for you.
Oh, no that's not it,
you can't fool me.
Oh, alright then, if that's
not your present,
then what is it?
I know, I know what it is.
Hi darling, I missed you.
Where is it, Bruno?
Where is it?
- Where's what?
- The dog?
[laughs]
- Would you believe that?
Well you're going
to have to wait for it.
They're sending
it to you from New York.
[laughs]
Oh boy, I'm getting a dog!
I'm getting a dog.
There you are, Eva.
Thanks.
- You alright?
- Yes, dear.
Oh if you want some others,
I have lots of them.
There they are over there.
Right.
Annalisa.
Oh Dora, darling, thanks.
You're looking just
wonderful, isn't she Paolo?
- Sure is.
- Thank you.
I was telling Paolo I knew
that sooner or later
you'd be coming back to us.
We all missed you, Dora.
Aldo, want a drink?
Thanks, you're always
the same, lovely.
Thanks, you haven't
changed either.
Thank you.
- Tell me, doctor.
- Eh?
What did you prescribe
for Dora this time?
What are you getting at?
You know very well
she hasn't been my patient
for some years.
She certainly recovered well.
Hardly looks like
the type of woman
who'd drive a man to suicide.
If you're trying to be funny,
I find it in bad taste.
Oh for God's sake, where's
your sense of humor?
I hardly think it's
a matter to joke about.
It was a great shock
to Dora, you know.
She, uh, certainly should
have expected it.
You know Carlo
was half crazy,
and on the needle long
before she married him.
See these marks here?
Each of these is a monkey
that I killed with this.
And where did all these
monkeys come from?
Oh, I don't know.
Why don't we ask your father?
Bruno's not my father,
he's my mother's
second husband.
- Are you bored, darling?
- No, I'm jealous.
- Oh?
- You're always leaving me.
Tsk, tsk, you could
at least wait 'till
we're all gone home.
[laughs]
He's right,
let's get rid of them.
¶ ¶
Mamma... I have to kill you.
Marco!
Marco!
Ah, oh!
[breaking glass]
Oh!
Dora!
Dora!
Easy now.
I'm alright, the light
was off and I tripped.
- Let me have a look.
- Oh my God, she's bleeding!
Oh it's nothing,
just a scratch, oh well.
You'd better disinfect it.
You've got to be more careful
of yourself.
There's alcohol
in the bathroom.
Alright, I missed my shot,
it's your turn.
That's a point for us.
I know you think planes fly
themselves, but you still
have the instruments
to worry about.
And I can tell you after
eight or ten hours in a cabin
your mind gets damn tired
keeping track of them.
Well, it's not
half enough, Andrea,
look how much we're
responsible for.
[laughs]
Well there's a shot that even
I couldn't beat, watch this.
Dora, is something
bothering you?
Are you asking me that
as a doctor or as a friend?
I don't mean
to sound so professional,
it just bothers me
to see you so upset.
Excuse me a moment.

Oh nothing seems
to go right, look.
That's because you're
still not relaxed.
I'm trying very hard, you know,
but after hearing Marco say
"Mamma, I must kill you,"
really upset me.
Oh, calm down and stop
punishing yourself.
We've been through
all this last night.
A seven year old boy
says a lot of things
he doesn't mean,
and you're taking it all
far too seriously.
Well it's the way he said it,
and the tone he used.
There's nothing worse
for a marriage,
than sending a husband
off without his coffee.
Bye.
Oh, will you be coming
home tonight?
If I don't elope
with a hostess.
Ha.
Bye.
Bye.

Are you ill?
I'm cold, I'm very cold!
Oh, poor darling,\.
God, your skin's like ice!
Take me away, I'm cold.
Yes, yes, of course dear.

It's alright, sweetheart,
Mamma will take
you upstairs to bed.
Marco, what is it?
Oh my God, don't worry.

Oh God, what's wrong baby?
Can't you talk?
I'll put you to bed

[chanting]
Damn this house,
and damn you for stopping
me from selling it.
It's easy for you
to be on the outside
and think it's all nonsense.
No, no that's not
what I meant.
What I was trying to say
is that things can sometimes
seem more serious
than they are.
It's only natural I'm nervous
after all that's happened.
Yes, this I can understand.
Well what is it you're
getting at?
I'm not getting at anything.
Yes you are, out with it.
You look rather
tired, dearest.
Why don't you go
see the doctor?
Why don't you
go to the sanatorium
and rest for a while?
That's it,
and you probably think
I'm imagining this pain.
Oh Dora, you're no cuckoo.
Nothing could be further
from my mind.
Look, your breakdown,
which heaven knows
was understandable, and could
have happened to anyone,
was a thing of the past.
You're perfectly well now,
and if you'd only give
yourself half a chance,
you could be happy too.
Still hurt?
Yeah, I should learn to watch
where to put my feet.
- Where's our photo?
- What?
There's just the frame!
Marco!
Hmm.
You're not doing
a very good job
at pretending to be asleep,
young fella.
[moans]
Come on now,
I know that you're awake.
Hi.
What are all these stories
your mamma's been
telling me, hmm?
Why are you always hiding?
Well I, I can't
tell you that now.
Why not?
I promise to tell you when
the time comes, okay?
Okay, it's a secret,
but you know you're
upsetting her
with your little tricks.
But she's always getting
mad over nothing.
She doesn't think the things
you've done are nothing.
You're making
her very nervous.
She's changed a lot ever
since we've moved here.
She's not fun anymore.
Did you take that picture off
the table in the living room?
Which picture?
Hmm, nevermind,
now get some sleep, we'll
talk about this tomorrow.
I'll leave the light
on in the hall.
Why?
You don't have to.
You can put it out.
Aren't you supposed
to be afraid of the dark?
Not anymore.
Good boy, I'm proud of you,
good night.
- Night.
According to him, you're
the one who's changed.
Well maybe I have,
but so has he.
I can't understand it.
He never lied before,
and he acts so strange.
He used to be such
a happy child.
He's like another person,
worries me.
You must try to be more
patient with him.
He's probably finding
his surroundings difficult
to cope with.
For him it's a new house.
Yes, that's true,
you're right,
but still, finding my
underwear torn to shreds...
that was sordid.
It was done out
of mere spite.
[scoffs]
I wouldn't like
to accuse your son
of having a sex fetish.
[laughs]
They were probably torn
in the washing machine
and you didn't notice
and you put them away.
Hmm, maybe you're right.
Just forget it.
You get yourself
to bed, love.
I've got to finish
my work report.
Bruno, why don't
we leave this house?

Oh, Bruno.
Hey, Bruno.
Oh, Franco.
I was waiting for you
in flight control,
but you walked right past me.
I must have been thinking
of something else, I guess.
Say, how's the new house?
Well, we've been having a few
problems, for Dora, mostly.
But it'll work out.
But didn't you tell me that
she lived there before?
She should be used to it.
Yeah, that's part
of the trouble.
Hey, Franco,

Morning, Olga.

No, it's nothing

he's at the clinic.
Tomorrow afternoon
at 3:30 or 6:00?

Thank you, Signora Forte.
Goodbye.
See if you like
this one, too.
Well, thank you, Marco.
Sit down.
Oh, what beautiful pictures.
Very good.
Can I have them?
Yeah, you can keep them
'cause I can draw others.
Thank you.
- Well now...
- Come in, Dora.
You come with me.
Are you gonna
make Mommy draw, too?
If she wants to.
- See you later.
- In a few minutes.
Sit down, Dora.
Please.
I gave your son
a very basic test.
It's quite simple.
Look at this drawing.
A beautiful tree.
Merry and laden with fruit.
I would say the child here
is without problems.
It's well proportioned.
The trunk is thick and solid
and the branches,
graceful and abundant.
The overall concept's
a positive one.
The first impression,
the child's behavior seems
to be balanced and quite
mature for his age.
Hmm.
Exactly the reverse
of the way he is at home.
Believe me.
Now, we'll take
the other one.
It represents his
relationship towards you.
The bed could indicate
the womb of security for him.
The figure of the boy,
which is represented
with his back turned,
could mean the child needs
more affection.
Or, he feels rejected.
But I am affectionate
with him.
I...I already told you.
Unfortunately, I'm not
a child psychologist.
But I do know you and your
problems very well.
Your past continual state
of anxiety and depression,
as a result of having to live
with that drug addict,
his suicide in the sea,
your six months
in the sanitarium,
and your electric
shock treatments,
might very well have
influenced your behavior
toward your son.
No.
That period is a complete
void inside of me.
My mind seems to have
cast it out.
Cancelled it completely.
It's all vague.
Only now, in that house,
in my house,
I'm starting
to remember things.
I guess it's due
to Marco's behavior.
But it's strange, it's as if
my own son is a go-between.
Dora, ghosts are mere
figments of our imagination.
We, ourselves, create them
to justify our actions
and behavior.
Try to understand.
If you can accept your past,
then you can face the future
peacefully with your husband
and child.
Mmm-hmm.

Marco?
Marco?
[door creaks]
Marco, are you down there?
Marco, answer me.
Marco!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stop hiding!
Marco!
Marco!
You're driving me crazy.
Mama!
Where have you been?
Why didn't you answer me?
¶¶
Why, Mama?
Why'd you kill Papa?

It was me!
I killed him!
I hated him!
I hated him!
Dora.
Dora!
Dora...
For the love of God, stop it.
It's not true.
You're not responsible.
No.
It-it was me.
It's horrible.
It was me.
- Dora.
- It's horrible!
- Dora, stop.
- It was me. It was me.
Carlo killed himself.
He never stopped telling
you he was a failure.
And once he started
on the needle,
that was already
the end of the line.
It was me.
It was me.
It's a blessing that now
you're rid of him.
You were living
with a real monster.
You were only a victim.
He wants to drive me crazy.
He wants revenge.
This house...is filled
with his presence.
I feel it.
He's the one who's
pushing Marco.
He's making him haunt me.
Please.
Take me away from here.
Please.
Please.
Please.
- Please.
- Dora...
- Please.
- Calm down now.
[repeating]
Please. Please. Please.
[sobbing]
No, I wanna go away!
I can feel him everywhere
in this damned house.
He wants to kill me, too.
- I wanna go away.
- Quiet, darling.
Bruno, I'm afraid.
[sobbing]
[crying]
Come on.
Drink this.
Come on.
Drink it all.
Come on.
All of it.
All of it.
That drawing.
It's Carlo.
Oh!
That's the proof.
Do you believe me now?
Please help me.
Please, please.
But Dora, it's just
a child's drawing.
No, it's not!
And stop those
stupid justifications.
I must be sure.
There's something
I must know.
I must be sure whether
I killed him or not.
I can't continue living
like this.
I can't stand it much longer.
I'll go out of my mind.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid of staying alone.
Of hearing and seeing things.
I'm even afraid
of my own son.

What are you doing?
Don't touch me!
I think you'd better
go back to bed.
I know...he's in there!
He's behind that wall!
No!
Carlo's there, isn't he?
It was the...
It was the only way
of getting rid of his body.
You see, Dora,
when I found you,
you had his blood
on your hands.
I don't think you'd even
realized what you'd done.
You're the most precious
thing I have in the world,
I had to protect you.
So my first instinct
was to hide the body
and remove all traces
of what had happened.
I pushed Carlo's boat
out to sea,
so it should look like
he'd had an accident
or committed suicide.
Everyone knew he was
depressed and an addict
and that, together
with your shock and amnesia,
made it easy.
No one suspected a thing.
We only had
to wait seven years
for him to be declared
legally dead.
I did it
to save you, darling,
because I loved you
and I still do,
more than ever.
You love me.
And you brought
me to live here?
How could you have done such
a thing if you loved me?
But Dora, you ought
to realize
what would have happened
to us if we'd sold the house
at that time
and not come back.
They'd have found
Carlo's body.
No...
All I want to do is get rid
of any evidence against you.
And then we can leave
this place forever.
What makes you think
we can leave?
Do you think he'll allow us?
Dora, what are you
talking about?
You still don't believe me.
How could you have let
such terrible things happen
to me all this time?
But it's all over now.
You left me alone
in this house.
Maybe you wanted me
to go crazy.
Dora, I was never
very far away.
He's here.
Among us.
I can feel his presence.
I saw him this evening.
Dora, Carlos is dead!
[brick falls]
[gasps]
He's back!
Don't touch him.
Let him be!
Don't touch him, leave him!
[screams]
Don't touch him!
[shattering]
[screams]
Dora, don't!
