- Hi, mr. Schraft here?
- No, he’s at work.
You the electrician?
Wiring in this building
is fucked.
Should have burnt down
years ago.
Kinda place you flip the light switch,
the fucking shower comes on.
- Yeah?
- Yep.
All right, that’s me,
i’m done. You want a beer?
No, i gotta
finish this.
Don’t take this the wrong way.
You’ve done a nice job,
But... you’re not a house
painter are you?
You noticed, huh?
Shit. I’ll do anything.
I’ll take whatever i can get.
Yeah, same here.
Somebody needs somethin’ done,
they just give old duke a call.
Duke?
That’s your name?
Yeah, well, nickname.
Last name is wayne, you know,
so it sort of stuck.
I’m a big guy, you know.
Duke wayne.
Cowboy electrician.
And you?
Sean crawley.
Ah, sean.
You irish?
I think my mom had
the hots for sean connery.
James fuckin’ bond, huh?
Sean fuckin’ crawley.
How about you?
Is that all you wanna do, huh?
Paint other
people’s houses white?
- I don’t know.
- You don’t know?
Hell, you’re
a young man.
You should be following
your dream or something.
Don’t you have a dream?
You know, some kind
of stupid fantasy?
You mean at the movies
or something,
Like being
a private eye?
Who said anything
about a private eye?
The car chases, the shootouts,
the beautiful women?
Hey, you don’t need a be a private eye to get some pussy.
- I thought we were talking about stupid fantasies.
- Not that fucking stupid.
- Hey, man.
- Thanks so much, dude.
I don’t know what
i’d do without you.
You’d walk.
When you gonna get another car, huh?
- I don’t know.
- This is l.a., man. You need a car.
Can you give me
your phone number?
That way something comes up,
i can give you a call.
Yeah, i’d love--
that’d be great.
I don’t--
i don’t have a pen.
Do you have a pen?
Fresh outta
business cards, huh?
Yeah.
- Hello.
- Sean? Sean crawley?
- Yeah, who’s this?
- This is duke. How’s it goin’?
Fine, i guess.
Yeah, listen,
i think i might have something for you.
- So what’s this all about?
- The boss needs something done.
- Mr. Crawley.
- How you doing?
- Ray matthews. Play golf?
- No.
That’s a shame.
Great game, golf.
I don’t get out here
enough.
Oh, no.
I’ll just watch if it’s all the same.
What are you talking about?
You’re on a golf course, you gotta play.
Nice shot.
Grab that bag, will you?
So you describe
your philosophy
On life as taking care
of number one, no?
Stupid not to.
There you go. These days
and times you gotta do
Exactly what you gotta do
just to survive, right?
That’s right.
And if along
the way you had to...
Bend the rules
a little?
I think i know what you’re
talking about, mr. Matthews.
What i’m talking about is what’s
right and what’s wrong.
Now, i’m not
suggesting that we...
Want to do anything
that’s illegal.
But,
you know, if, uh...
You get involved
in something that was...
Anti-sociable.
Duke, what’s the term i’m looking for?
Ah...
Immoral?
Exactly.
Immoral.
So, uh...
What would your feelings
be on issues of...
You know, things that are
immoral, crawley?
Well, i suppose it’s up to us to sort it out for ourselves,
i guess.
- Nicely put.
- Very nicely put.
Mm-hmm.
So what do you want me
to do exactly?
We need somebody watched.
His name’s eric gatley.
He’s an accountant at city hall.
And you want me
to follow him?
I want you
in this guys jock,
Morning, noon,
and night, okay?
I want you to get to know
him inside and out.
If this guy takes
a fucking piss,
I wanna know what color.
Oh, shit.
Shit! Shit!
- Oh, shit.
- Watch where you’re going!
Oh!
Have a good time.
Come here.
Thank you so much.
My turn next week, okay?
Hey.
Thanks again.
All right, bye-bye.
Wear your seatbelt.
- Bye, mom. Bye, dad.
- Bye-bye.
- Go save the world.
- Bye.
Bye-bye.
Excuse me.
- Hi, susan.
- Hi, tony.
- Doing okay today?
- Uh-huh.
- You look good.
- Thanks.
I’ll see you inside.
- Miss park?
- Yes, hello.
- Hi, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.
- Eric gatley.
- Good to meet you.
Listen, thank you very much for taking the time to come out here.
I appreciate your call.
So, understand i can’t leave you with any of these materials just yet
And i’m speaking
for background only.
Okay, i understand.
Let’s see.
Here we have the original,
this is the ’97 estimates...
yeah, it was that chinese
chick from the 11:00 news.
You sure it was her?
- Yeah, positive. Gatley had this file.
He was showing her stuff.
Papers and shit.
Jesus.
Jesus fucking christ.
All right,
i’ll tell matthews.
You stay on the job, okay?
It’s more important now than ever.
- Hey sean, you didn’t do so bad, huh?
- Thank you.
Yeah, you may not be a professional,
but you did a nice job.
Hey, crawley,
Nice fucking
neighborhood you live in.
You know how long i’ve been fucking sitting here waiting for you?
About that long.
Don’t fucking stare at me,
get in.
You know you--
You’ve been really good
for me, crawley.
Well, i get
the job done.
Let me tell you
a little story.
Once upon a time there
was this girl-- samantha.
She was, uh--
She was my secretary.
She was 18 years old.
She looked like she was 13,
you know what i mean?
Yeah.
I was, uh--
I was head over heels
in love with this girl.
I mean stupid, you know?
Like some teenage pussy.
I’d a done anything
for this girl.
But it wasn’t-- it really
wasn’t all that easy.
I mean, samantha lived
with her family and--
And i was--
fuck, i was married.
Anyway, i had
this guy i worked with,
He had an apartment that was close by the office.
So i worked something out with him where he would give me the keys,
He’d disappear for a little while and i could
Go up there
with samantha.
The first time
i ever take her up there--
And i tell you what,
i wanted this pussy bad--
We get in there and the guy’s
got a little fucking dog.
Right away,
she grabs the dog,
And i’m going, "samantha,
leave the dog. Let’s go back here."
I get her in
the fucking bedroom.
Things are, you know,
they’re leaning towards,
Where i wanna go,
you know?
Suddenly the dog starts
scratchin’ at the door.
She’s looking at the door
and she’s laughing, you know?
Paying more attention to the fucking dog than me.
"Sam, sam, excuse me a minute."
I walk out the door and i boot this fucking dog right across the room,
Like a fucking field goal.
It shuts him right up,
i get in the fucking room,
And the next thing you know,
i got the blouse is coming open and it’s all good.
And i know that
fucking clam is shaved.
You know what i mean?
I gotta see it.
And the fucking dog starts
scratching at the door again,
Yelping-- and now she’s looking at the fucking door and she’s losing--
She’s losing her concentration.
She isn’t in the fucking moment anymore.
"Excuse me, sam."
I walk out the fucking door
And i grab
the fucking dog,
And i snap it’s
fucking neck like a twig.
I take the fucking little cocksucker and
i throw him down the laundry shoot.
And i go back
in the room...
It turns out little ol’
sammy fucks like a bunny.
There’s a point
to the story, crawl.
Sometimes you gotta be
a little bit ruthless.
Something gets in your way,
you eliminate it.
You know
what i mean?
So the question
really is...
How far are you willing
to go, crawl?
To get rid
of a barking dog?
Well, i mean...
The conditions would
have to be right.
What would these
conditions be?
Okay, um...
Well, one--
there would have to be
No possible way of my getting
caught or even suspected.
That’s a given.
Right.
And then, i’d have to be sure
i was physically safe.
You know, i wouldn’t want
to put myself in danger from
The victim or anyone else
who might be around, so i--
I’d have to be in a guaranteed
superior position.
You mean stronger?
Yeah, i mean one way or another,
with better weapons or surprise or whatever.
Makes sense.
Okay. Four--
Whoa, what happened
to three?
- We just did three.
- What was it?
It doesn’t matter.
Fine, this is three then.
Which is--
it’s actually part of two.
Anyway, it’s--
I’d have to be 100 % sure
that i could pull it off.
- You shoot the fucking guy.
- No, no, no. You see, i can’t--
That doesn’t-- that comes back
to the point-- to number--
The point about safety.
Where it can’t be a weapon that could ever be traced.
- That’s-- that’s good thinking.
- Yeah.
Okay...
what number are we at?
Who the fuck knows?
You lost me back at three!
You know what?
It doesn’t matter.
Five then, point five--
A reason.
I’d need a reason
why i was gonna do it.
Such as?
Such as a...
reward.
Reward?
Yeah,
you know...
If there was a big enough
reward for doing it.
How’s five grand sound?
Sounds like nothing.
15 has
a better ring to it.
10.
13.
How’s 13 grand sound?
That’s my lucky number.
I’m sorry.
Don’t answer the door.
Don’t answer the door,
you fucker.
Don’t be stupid
all your life.
Hi, mr. Gatley.
Is susan home?
No, she took
our daughter to ballet.
Oh, shoot,
i thought she’d be here on a saturday.
Yeah, no, i’m sorry.
- I’m from the midnight mission. Can i leave a message?
- Oh.
Sure.
I don’t have a pen
and paper.
Uh... oh,
Yeah, hang on, sorry.
I’m in the garden, i’ll just...
Thank you.
Okay, let’s see...
This place
is such a mess.
Oh.
Yeah, you know what?
That’s actually kind of somewhat valuable.
I’d rather that you didn’t
handle that. Thank you.
What are you doing?
Shh.
Just be quiet, man.
Don’t worry.
Just lie down.
Just lie down.
Where’s your hat?
Go to sleep.
Bye, mr. Gatley.
I’ll call
later this week.
Fucking asshole!
I’m sorry!
Come on, duke.
Come on, you fat fuck!
Answer the phone!
Answer the fucking phone!
Eric gatley’s wife,
susan, has no idea
Why her
husband was murdered.
Police have no new
leads in the case, but...
I could reveal exclusively
that i spoke
To the murdered city hall accountant just days before he was killed.
Eric gatley had been investigating corruption in city hall...
Shit, guy wears a hat
like that deserves to die.
...He had been looking into the activities of this man,
Local building contractor,
ray matthews.
It’s your shot.
Sean, it’s your turn.
- ...The work of a professional hit man d
- yeah...
...Made to look like
a casual robbery gone wrong.
I’m sorry,
i gotta go, george.
What?
We’re in the middle
of a game here-- sean!
- Hello.
- Sean.
Duke! Oh,
for christ’s sakes!
- Look, where--
- shut up and listen!
Tomorrow morning.
The zoo. First thing.
You got
some talking to do.
Me?! I’ve got some
talking to do?!
Duke! Duke!
What’s going on here, duke?
What are we doing at the zoo?
You know anybody
that ever goes to the zoo?
- No.
- No, well, me neither.
This way no one
will recognize us.
Besides...
I kinda like it.
It’s nice.
- So you got my money?
- What fucking money?
- Matthews owes me.
- Oh, fuck.
Come on, will ya?
Sean, you know what people do
when the go to the zoo?
What?
They try to figure out what animals their friends look like.
Duke. Duke!
You never played
this game before?
Of course, usually, it’s monkeys,
i’ll grant you that, but i think we can do better.
- Duke--
- and no fair are the obvious stuff,
Like calling me a fucking elephant or a warthog or something.
You gotta use
the imagination.
As for you...
Clearly we have to go
to the reptile house.
Duke!
Yeah, there’s a bit of a lizard about you,
you know?
A little bit slimy,
Watchful, waiting.
- A little bit of camouflage.
- Quit fucking around, duke!
- What’s so fucking funny?
- You are! You’re fucking hilarious.
You come on the big
tough detective.
You think you got it
all figured out,
But you’re fucking pitiful.
Why do you think we hired you in the first place?
I don’t know,
because if anything happened i can’t be connected to you.
Yeah, and...?
And i guess, because
you thought i’d be good at it.
You? What good are you
at following people?
Figuring things out?
You’re a clueless little turd
who’s about a good a detective
As i am a fucking ballerina.
You don’t even have a car,
for christ’s sakes!
No, you’re useless. That’s why we hired you,
because you’re useless.
Why? Fuck it,
duke, why?
We wanted to rattle the guy,
shake him up.
He’d had his dick out
for so long we wanted to know
If he was going
to fuck or fuck up.
So, i think of you.
You’ll follow the guy.
He’s gonna see you,
maybe get all shook up,
Freak out.
Then he makes a move and we haven’t touched him.
And then you go
and kill the guy?
- That was your plan.
- Oh, no, that was never my plan.
That was
ray’s brilliant idea.
Fucking ray.
The only way for you to be completely safe is to disappear.
I did a job
and i want to be paid.
Why would anybody give you
13 grand to do anything?
But i did it,
and i want my money,
And i’m not leaving town
until i get it.
And if i have to make it
difficult for you, i--
You’re nothing. You’re
a worthless piece of shit
Who got involved in something
you should have left alone.
You don’t tell me
to do anything!
All right, you’re gonna
get no more money,
And you will disappear,
you understand?
I don’t want to ever
see you again.
And if i do...
I’ll can kill you.
I can kill you and i wouldn’t
even break into a sweat.
I could just crush you
and then it would be over.
Like you said, nothing
could tie us to you.
So go away now.
Go.
Oh, look.
I think i found you.
Yeah, there you are.
Look, sean.
Look, look, i found you.
I found you, right there!
You’re an insect.
A fucking ant.
Look, that one there--
he looks just like you.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Hey.
You okay?
You sounded pretty pissed off on the phone.
Yeah, i know.
Well, what’s up?
You know those guys
i told you about?
Yeah, the ones
who won’t pay you?
Yeah, well...
It’s getting pretty scary,
actually.
They’re trying to frighten
me off, make me leave town.
If i were you,
i’d just do what they say.
They owe me, george.
Yeah, but these guys
get pretty serious.
I’d just do what they want,
get out of town.
You know, there’s
nothing keeping you here.
No, i’m not leaving.
I need you to do
something for me.
What?
I need you
to keep this for me.
- I don’t think so--
- it’s just contracts and shit.
It’s just proof i did the work.
Just keep it till i figure out what i’m going to do.
- I don’t know, man.
- George, they don’t know you.
All right?
Keep it safe.
- Sean.
- Shit.
Where did you go?
Hey!
Get back here!
Hey, come on now!
What are you--
don’t make me run after you!
Sorry, george.
Come on, now.
Wow!
Ow!
Shit!
- He’s clean.
- Carl, let’s go.
What the fuck, duke?
What do you want?
I told you, i want you to fuck off.
Why are you still here?
All right, look,
i got something for you.
- What’s that?
- Train ticket to chicago.
There is a guy who’s gonna meet you at the station,
all right?
- He’ll have your money.
- Chicago?!
- We want you outta here.
- How do i know the guy’ll be there?
- How can i trust you?
- You don’t have a choice.
So long.
- I’ve got his file, duke.
- Huh?
Gatley’s file.
All the evidence he was compiling against matthews.
I’ve got it.
Yeah, it’s evidence
of a different kind now.
Some personal notes
of my own in it.
In fact, i think you’re name
is mentioned once or twice.
What are you saying?
Come on, duke. You’ve seen enough movies,
you know the line.
Anything happens to me
and that file shows up.
Where’s the file, sean?
Let’s forget about this whole chicago thing, huh?
What do you say?
We both know there’s
no guy in chicago.
Take me back to town.
Stay down!
- What’s up? Uh?
- Give me the fucking phone.
Kid’s got a file on gatley.
I want you to tell
matthews--
Tell him to send someone around to his apartment,
all right?
Search the place.
Where is the file,
sean?
What if i don’t
tell you?
What are you gonna do,
kill me? I don’t think so.
Oh!
So...
You’re just gonna
beat me up, huh?
Where is the file?
My lips are sealed.
So, if you’re gonna beat me up later,
you might as well beat me up now.
- Yeah, you’d like that, huh?
- Come on, do it.
Do it now,
it’s all the same to me.
You don’t care
if i beat you up, huh?
I’ll still be alive,
So it doesn’t scare me.
Shit, you could spend the rest of the year just beating the shit out of me,
And at the end of it,
i’ll still be alive,
And you still wouldn’t know
where the file is.
So you see, unless
you’re gonna kill me...
I can deal with it.
How about i cut
your balls off?
Well, i’m sure a person
can get used to it.
You would know.
- What did he say?
- He wants us to go to his place out in the desert.
- The fucking ranch?
- Hey, that’s what he said.
- Oh, fuck that.
- If that’s what the man says...
Carl, put on some music.
It’s gonna be
a long fucking day.
- ♪ What’s up? ♪ His
- ♪ to the hot boys that party where you’re at ♪
♪ What’s up? ♪
- ♪ What’s up? ♪ S

all right.
What are you
gonna do to me, duke?
No balls, huh?
I’m gonna catch you later
though, sean.
Mr. Crawley.
Sleep well?
How’d you like
our little hotel?
I need to piss.
We’ll get to that in a few minutes.
Sit down.
You know, it’s
a beautiful day out.
On a day like today,
I should be
playing golf.
Great game, golf.
You know?
Helps you think.
Is that right?
Yeah, that’s right.
Tie him up.
Duke here is very proficient with knots.
Aren’t you, duke?
Used to be in the boy scouts,
mr. Matthews.
Ow.
Where’s the file,
sean?
Come on, you know
i’m not going to tell you.
You know what i’d like, sean?
I’d like for you to vanish.
Vanish off the face of the earth,
that’s what i’d like.
But you hired me.
I did exactly what you told me to do.
What are you talking about,
i was drunk.
You shouldn’t listen to me.
- This is crazy.
- Yeah, tell me about it.
See, i got a problem here. I’m in a lot of shit.
Cops are getting real close to me.
Well, i’m the last person who’s gonna go to the cops.
Can’t you see that?
Sooner or later the cops
are going to come to you.
Okay?
But without you around,
They can’t prove a thing.
Don’t you think killing me is gonna make things a little more complicated?
I mean, for one thing
if i die that file comes to--
Whoa, whoa. Killing ya?
Who said anything about killing you, boys?
No one’s gonna kill you,
sean.
See you, my friend, are the only killer in this room.
My hands are clean.
And i would like
to keep it that way.
Give the man a drink.
His nose, you moron.
- No.
- Come here.
More, more, more, more.
Oh, jesus.
Filthy animal!
Carl, get some water
and clean him up, will you?
You gotta be careful
with whiskey, crawley.
Deadens the pain,
but fucks the brain.
See, what i really
need you to do is disappear.
You know, poof, gone,
nobody, nothin’.
Then i had an idea.
You really don’t need to kill a guy to make him disappear, right?
Let me tell you
a little story.
There was a guy who used to work for me,
dino scarbor.
- Remember dino, duke?
- Yeah, poor bastard.
Now, listen. Great guy,
good looking, sharp dresser.
Could kill the ladies, i mean,
just a joy to have around.
Yeah, could talk the panties
off a nun, couldn’t he?
So i got dino on this construction site,
we’re working together.
A crane with a big, big block
of cement comes over
And whacks dino right
in the side of the head.
Didn’t kill him,
trust me he wished it had.
- We don’t call him dino no more.
- We call him dumbo.
Guy’s a vegetable, can’t
understand a word he’s saying.
Believe me, i don’t think
he can understand most of it.
He just sits there
staring at the wall.
It’s pitiful.
Drooling all over himself.
You know it’s really,
really, scary
What a single blow
to the head can do.
Really scary.
You know, it feels like
about a three wood.
I think i got
the wrong club.
Come on, matthews.
You’re not serious, are you?
You know...
Maybe you hid the file
someplace, maybe you didn’t.
The way i figure it,
i can make you forget where you put it.
I can make you forget
everything.
- The stupidest thing i ever heard.
- Come on, crawley.
Who’s gonna pay any
attention to a shuffling
Juiced up head case
like yourself, huh?
You can’t just make somebody
a vegetable, you can’t.
Oh, no?
Tell that to dumbo.
Hey, carl.
Don’t want to leave any marks,
So cut off a piece of that mattress,
wrap it around his head.
Matthews...
sean crawley
on the outside.
Dumbo dino on the inside.
It’s gonna be fun.
No.
Let’s go.
Alrighty, i’m figuring
right about there.
You ready, crawl?
Ho-ho!
Okay.
Step back, boys.
You ready?
Measure it
right there.
Whoa! Par five..
Long, ho!
Four!
Yeah, he’s coming around.
What do you think?
Man, he’s pissed
all over himself.
You okay?
Hey.
He don’t look so good.
You look really fucked up.
Have a drink.
It’s amazing
you qualified.
It’s amazing.
It’s so exciting.
All right, get in.
- Get in there!
- No!
Hey!
Come on, have a drink.
Come on, drink it, come on!
No!
Please guys,
you don’t have to do this.
Please!
You should have thought about that.
Where’s that file, sean?!
No!
Susan.
Cocksucking motherfucking
murdering faggot!
Stop it! Stop it! Shut up!
Shut up!
Stop it!
Fuck you!
- You call that music?
- Yeah.
Seriously, there’s no melody there.
It’s all bow-- b-- bow!
- It’s a beat, sure.
- What do you call music, michael bolton?
- Sting?
- You want some music? John tesh.
- John tesh?
- John tesh.
- Entertainment tonight john tesh?
- Yeah.
Are you kidding me, man?
You fucking suck.
- Foghat.
- Foghat?
- Yeah.
- Who the fuck is that, man?
- You don’t know anybody.
- No, man, i don’t know all those groups’ names.
- Oh, jesus, you stink!
- Ooh.
Are you sick?
Are you sick?
What the fuck
are you doing?
He’s sick.
He’s got a fever, man.
So what?
He’s gonna die
in that shithole.
Yeah, then maybe
we can all go home.
Sean.
I’m so....
hungry.
Feed me, sean.
Feed me, sean.
No! I’m sorry!
I’m so sorry!
- My fucking turn!
- Bullshit, you did him today!
No, that was yesterday
fucking morning, dude.
- Come on.
- No way, you always get to do him!
Fuck that.
You fakin’ it?
Are you fakin’ it?
Come on. Come on,
you can tell me.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Down, down. Sit, sit.
That’s it, that’s it,
that’s it.
Come on, drink up.
Come on, come on, come on.
That’s it.
Aw, look at them.
They’re as bad as you.
Christ, you think
you’ve got it bad?
Try being shacked up
with those two morons.
Aw, it’s a shit job.
Hey, sean.

intelligence than him.
Shit!
I won a goldfish at a carnival that was more intelligent than him.
He’s dog meat.

You were told no muck.

In this condition,

Get the first-aid kit.

Sean, what the fuck’s going on?
I looked in this thing.
How did you find me?
I followed matthews.
Worked it out from the file.
Followed him to the ranch.
I’ve never been
so happy to see you, man.
I’m confused,
you know?
It’s like dogs i understand,
but people...
They’re just ants, george.
Doesn’t matter.
Back there...
I realized
what my part is.
I finally know now what i was always meant to be.
What?
I’m an exterminator.
What the fuck?! Fuck you, okay?
It’s not a fucking joke.
All right?
You killed a guy.
- Two guys.
- Why?!
Help me understand why?
I mean, gatley?
Why?
I don’t know,
it just happened.
It was his hat.
You said it yourself, man.
He just looked so fucking
dumb in that hat.
You killed him ’cause of a hat?
A fuckin’ hat?
I killed him
because i wanted to.
Fuck!
Jesus christ, man!
I risked my life
for you!
And you’re talking about
fucking ants!
What the fuck, man!
You sound crazy or insane.
George, i’m the same guy
i always was.
- Get out of my van.
- George.
Get the fuck--
get out of my fucking van.
- George.
- Get the fuck out!
George, no.
George, come on.
George!
No.
Sit down a minute.
My god!
What happened to you?
- The cops.
- Cops did this to you?
Don’t let them
take me, okay?
- We gotta get you to a hospital. Gary!
- No! Don’t!
Not the hospital.
That’s how the cops--
Please don’t take me
to the hospital.
- They’ll get me.
- You need help. Gary!
I knew you’d come.
I knew you’d come.
Woman on the floor!
Let’s get him
over here, okay?
All right.
Let me take that.
Go down slow.
Slow.
- Easy.
- Okay.
Ow! Ow!
Okay, i’ll get him some clothes while you can check him.
What’s your name?
James bond.
James bond, huh?
Todd, james todd.
Well, james,
why don’t you give me this?
No!
Okay, you can keep it.
Just put it down, all right?
I need to examine you.
Put it down.
Tell me where it hurts.
- No, no!
- All right.
- No! Ou.
- Here, i got it.
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!
James, it’s okay,
i’m here!
Look at me.
I’m here!
It’s okay.
It’s okay.
- I’m sorry.
- Go back to sleep.
- I’m sorry.
- It’s okay.
Bad dreams, huh?
Yeah, i know.
I know what that’s like.
Tell me about it.
What?
What happened to you,
susan?
My husband, eric--
He was recently
murdered.
What happened?
He was an accountant
At city hall, and...
He was investigating
a construction company.
I guess the company didn’t
like what he discovered and....
They put a hit
out on him.
You’re doing really well.
You’re a survivor.
I hardly recognize you from the guy
we brought in three of four weeks ago.
Couldn’t have done it
without you.
Well, it’s been really
good for me too,
Being given
the chance to...
james, you all right?
No, i’m fine.
I just--
Just the mother of all headaches.
It’s okay.
It’s all right.
It’ll go away.
Like pain always does.
So, james...
You can’t stay in the shelter for much longer.
It’s really only meant
for temporary accommodation.
We need the bed.
So, do you have
somewhere to go
Or will you just go
back on the streets?
No, no,
i have somewhere to go.
Come on,
you can’t stay here.
...It’s just that you don’t know anything about him.
I mean, who is he?
- Hey.
- Hey.
- It’ll be all right.
- Be careful.
Hey, baby, where you going?
- See you tomorrow.
This is it.
Oh.
We, uh--
we eat in here.
Okay, i’ll show you
the bedrooms.
And this will be your room,
while you’re here.
Aby,
- that’s caitlin. I’ll let you get yourself sorted.
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.
You’re the best, mo.
Hey, baby. Thank you.
Caitlin, this is james,
who i told you about.
- Hello, james.
- Hey.
Well, thanks for letting me
stay at your house.
That’s okay.
People shouldn’t be alone.
You know, they go crazy.
And then they start to do
stupid things.
They forget how the rest
of the world lives.
It’s not healthy.
I don’t know what i’m saying.
It’s just...
Being in this room,
Where it all--
There’s just lots
of things to remind me.
You got a new fridge.
What?
I mean,
that can’t be the one.
No, i had to get rid
of that.
I had to get rid
of a lot of stuff.
- T rid
- excuse me.
Hello? Hi, gary.
Yeah,
everything’s fine.
Tomorrow, um...
I guess so.
Yeah, just gonna
need the address.
Hang on, let me find
some paper.
Go ahead.
All right, good night.
You’re very efficient.
I didn’t even know
there was paper in there.
To the both of us.
I feel like i’ve died
and gone to heaven.
Mommy, i woke up.
Oh, sweetie.
You want a story,
huh?
Careful. Okay.
Is this any good
to you?
It’s eric’s.
It was eric’s.
No, no.
You can’t beat me!
- You can’t!
- Go catie! Whoo, yeah!
Look ma, no ha-- i--
- Oh.
- Are you okay?
Yep, i’m
indestructible.
I won! I won, mommy!
I won! Yes!
Yeah!
You sure you have
everything?
- Don’t worry, mommy.
- You’re gonna call me, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hi, everyone.
Right on time.
Hey, girls.
Hey.
All right,
have a great weekend.
You’ll still be here
when i get back, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thanks a million,
maureen.
Behave yourself.
- Okay, girls.
- Buckle up.
- Bye.
- Have fun, guys.
But you can’t feel guilty.
I mean, there’s no point
in feeling guilty.
It happened.
I mean,
it just happened.
Somewhere out there there are people who are guilty.
But they’ll be punished.
You and me...
We just gotta move on
with things.
I know.
Talking to you--
talking it all out.
We’re okay--
you and me, huh?
You remember
the other night,
When i said i’d died
and gone to heaven?
Yeah.
I wasn’t joking.
I did die back there,
And i’ve been reborn.
I mean, i am--
The person i was is dead,
and i am a new person now.
I can start over.
I can just...
Leave that
all behind me.
We don’t really know
each other, do we, james?
We know enough.
This is gonna sound
really stupid, but...
We share something.
I don’t--
i’m not really sure what,
But when i first
met you,
I felt like i already
knew you.
Something...
Why am i doing this?
It beats me.
Your scars...
They’re so sexy.
It’s okay.
Oh, man!
Look at this, huh?!
The sun is shining!
And the king is back in town!
That’s right!
Up and at ’em, world!
Look out, ’cause i’m gonna
do it, susan!
Yeah, i’m gonna rejoin
the human race.
- Here i go!
- Go carefully.
Good start.
Yeah.
One more time.
And he’s off!
What the fuck?!
Don’t fucking do that, man!
What’s the matter,
ants in your pants?
Jesus christ, sean.
What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck!
- What if they fucking followed you, man?
- Would you frickin’ relax?
Calm down. Everything’s fine,
everything’s cool. No one knows i’m here.
- Everything’s cool?
- Yeah.
I can’t go home,
i can’t go to work.
I can’t do fucking shit.
I’m afraid
they might get me.
I’m gonna make everything all right.
All right?
I’m scared, okay?
They’re not
gonna get you.
I’m scared of you,
you fucker.
Me?
I’m just an ordinary guy.
Now, i’m back
on my feet.
I just need to tie up
a few loose ends.
Some things
i gotta know.
I don’t want anything
to jeopardize what i got.
Anything? What?
Anyone. You followed them,
you found things out. There’s shit i gotta know.
Your file?
What about the file?
Yeah, but there’s some stuff that’s not in the file.
Addresses.
Shit.
Oh, shit!
My file!
Oh, my fucking file!
You stupid fuck!
Whoa!
Susan?
Susan?
Are you home?
Who are you?
Susan...
Who are you?
Susan, i thought i could
make it better.
It wasn’t my fault.
I thought i could make it--
How could you do it?
- It wasn’t me.
- Then who was it!
You destroyed everything!
And then you
come back here!
- Just let me talk for--
- talk?!
What could you possibly say?!
What lies?!
There’s nothing you could say!
There’s nothing you could say!
- Susan--
- i feel sick.
My skin where you
touched me-- my lips!
No!
No, no!
It’s locked.
That door’s locked too.
All the doors
and windows are locked.
I called the police.
It’s over.
Susan. Susan,
i’m sorry about--
Sorry?
Ow!
Susan, please let me go.
- I’m not gonna hurt you.
- What?
- Give me the--
- no!
Put it down!
No!
Susan, susan, wait!
Stop, please.
I don’t want to do this.
Don’t make me fight you!
- I don’t want to hurt you!
- Hurt me?
Hurt me?!
For god’s sake, stop it!
Just listen.
Where’s the key?
No! No!
Give me the fucking key!
Susan?
No. No.
Hey, becket! Becket!
Becket, it’s him!
Come on!
Crawley, where the fuck

Shut up and listen.
I want it over.
We gotta finish this.
I’ve got the file. You want it,
you come and get it.
- Yeah, where? Onna make
- needs to be out of town. Somewhere no one will see us.
- What about my place in the desert?
- I don’t know.
Come on-- what do you mean,
you don’t know?
Okay. All right,
i guess i could be there in a couple hours.
- That give you enough time?
- No problem. We’ll see you there.
Fuckers.
Hello, duke.
I’m fixing things,
duke.
First thing i gotta do is remove all evidence of myself.
Like i never existed.
That’s what you wanted, right?
So, i guess we should start with
disguising that wound on your neck, okay?
Okay.
I want the cops sorting through this mess till the end of time, duke.
I don’t want them
ever to find me.
You know what, duke?
I’m not a professional,
But i do a nice job.
Look at her.
We could have been
happy together, me and her...
If it wasn’t for you guys.
You like barbecues,
right, duke?
Just quit your griping,
and do as you’re told.
- But this is bullshit, man.
- No! Shut the fuck up
And get in the house.
It’s easy.
Motherfucker.
This is getting too weird.
Wayne. Motherfuck!
All right.
All right, listen,
That little fucker’s around here somewhere.
I want him now.
Let’s finish it.
All right, carl,
you check upstairs, all right?
Becket, you check
out by the shed.
I’ll check all around
outside. Hey, hey!
- No fuck ups.
- It’s too late for that, man.
All right, come on.
Let’s go!
Bullshit.
Fucking hog fill.
Oh, shit!
Ah!
Duke, jesus.
What the fuck
is he up to?
All right,
get carl, come on!
We’ll finish this now,
go!
Oh, shit.
Shit.
Carl!
Shit, man!
Jesus, man!
What happened?
Where is he?!
He’s upstairs.
He’s upstairs.
- He’s here! Pened?
- What?
He’s here!
Ahh!
Oh! Oh, shit!
Oh!
What the fuck?!
That’s gasoline.
Ah!
What the fuck do you think
you’re doing, crawley?!
Cleaning up.
I was willing
to make a deal!
- Bullshit.
- You fuck.
I’ll fucking kill you!
It’s all over, ray.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
You shouldn’t have
fucked with me.
- Wait, this is your fault, man!
- Goodbye, ray.
Wait, wait!
- Help me! Man!
- Get real.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
You didn’t need
to do this.
Yes, i did.
- Where’s ray?
- Dead.
Oh, shit.
That’s carl’s line.
Look, it’s finished.
It’s over.
I had nothing to do with this.
Help me, please.
My back.
Something happened
to my back, please help me.
Just help me!
Oh, god.
Oh god,
i feel so cold!
Please help me.
If i stay here i’ll die.
I’ll die!
Why?
There needs
to be a reason?
I’ll tell you
what this is all about.
You ever watch ants?
- Ants?
- Ants.
Saw some
at the zoo once.
Thousands of them,
just...
Eating, shitting,
fucking, dying.
Just like they always have
for millions of years.
What are you
talking about?
What are you trying
to say?
What i’m trying to say...
Is that it doesn’t matter
what any of us do.
It’s a shitty world.
Or it’s the best of all
possible worlds,
Just depends
on how you look at it.
But there’s nothing
anybody can do about it.
The ants will keep on
doing what they do
And we just keep on
doing what we do.
In a few minutes
you’ll be dead.
And there’s nothing any
of us can do about that.
I never did
anything wrong.
It doesn’t work
like that, becket.
Please,
i never beat you.
I looked after you,
please.
Nothing matters anymore,
becket,
’Cause you’re dead.
You-- you’re
going to kill us then?
That’s what i do.
Oh, shit.
Re
crawley, come back!
Help me!
Help me!
Crawley!
Oh, god!
Crawley!
Help me!
Crawley?
- Crawley? Awley!
- Oh, shit.
No! No!
No!
Oh, no!
