Staff!  Man fainted!
Morning, Sir. Heat exhaustion.
We're expecting a new lot
of prisoners in, aren't we?
I've five listed, Sir,
but we can get a lot more.
Can we?
The new push has started.
As soon as there's a bit of action
the bloody layabouts
are begging to get in here.
I've a special coming in, Sir.
A broken Sgt. Major.
What, Roberts? So they found him guilty?
- No doubt about that was there, Sir?
I suppose not.
- I want him fit, Sir.
- If he's fit you'll get him Sgt. Major.
I want him, Sir.
Morning, Harris.
- Morning, Sir!
You the new Staff?
- Sir!
Name, Staff?
- Staff Williams, Sir.
Staff!  You gonna keep
them line dodgers idling all day?
Worked in the civvy jails, haven't you?
- Yes, Sir.
And Aldershot?
-Yes, Sir.
Why give up the comforts of civvy life?
- I wanted overseas, Sir.
Gerry bombed the scrubs...
is that right?
- Yes, Sir.
Then you'll like it here,
nice and peaceful, ain't it, Staff Harris?
I'll do my job anywhere I'm sent, Sir.
Huh, enjoy prison work?
- Fancy I'm the right man for the job, Sir.
Do you?  Staff Harris, here, don't reckon
himself as a man with a mission.
Is that right, Harris?
Well, there's other jobs, they can
still use men up front, Sir.
Then why the hell didn't you
join the commandos?
No... all I meant was...
I've done 25 years and where the
hell do you think I'd like to be right now?
Nobody's gonna pin a medal on us.
Now get this straight.  One job's as
important as the next.
Is that clear?
- Sir!
New prisoners for release, Sir!
- Double them over here!
Carry on Jake.
- Sir!
About turn!  Right turn!
Keep them knees up, keep them up!
Halt!
Right, lets have your names.  You?
743 Walters, Sir.
- Put your kit bag down.  You?
158 Martin, Sir.
- Put your kit down.
Due for release, eh?
- Yes, Sir.
What we in for, Martin?
- Went absent, Sir.
You, Walters?
- Went absent, Sir.
You going absent again?
- No, Sir.
When they came to me they were on
the run.  Living it up in Cairo, wasn't it?
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.
Living with a couple of cabaret bints.  Very
tough they was considering they was pimps.
Wasn't going to do nothing
I told them, was ya?  Well speak up!
We sort of thought like that, Sir.
Any complaints about any
members of my Staff?  - No, Sir.
Glad of that.  We treated you
well, better than you deserve.
You look better and you smell sweeter.
Gave you both hell, didn't I?
- No, Sir.
- Could've been worse, Sir.
Good of you to make a speech.
You know I made you suffer.
To find out if there
was any good in you.
You hurt yourselves,
lads, trying to beat me.
You take the hill, the pack drill, the lot
and learn about discipline the hard way.
I've doubled in thousands like you.
The dregs, the dross,
the filth of the gutters.
But when I've doubled them out,
they've turned out like you, too.
Like men.
And a credit to the uniform.
Right, pick up you kits.
About turn!
Double march!
Left, right, left, right...
Staff
- Sir.
We got room in B Wing for five prisoners?
- Yes, Sir.
All in one cell, fix it.
-Sir. I will.
New scum and old scum are bad mixes.
I'll assign Staff Williams to you, Harris.
He can cut his teeth on this new lot.
Fix it.
- Sir!
A new intake of prisoners, Sir.
Sweat them down!
Double them before
you give them to me!
Sir!  Double March!
I'm a fair man, Staff.  All I
ask is that the prisoners obey
orders at the double, and your
job is to see that they do!
Sir!
Every member of my Staff's
got my full backing.
There's the Commandant, of course...
The Commandant signs bits of paper.
He'd sign his own death
warrant if I handed it to him,
but I run this place, you get that?
The Commandant doesn't like
being troubled with trivialities
so only take up serious matters with him,
Staff, like arson or sudden death
but see me first, always.
Take over, Staff!
- Sir!
Pick up your dressing.
Come on look lively!
Stand still!
Right, turn out your kit.
Tidy it up. Tidy it up...
Stand still!
Sir, that's my...
- You'll get a receipt.
Love letters.
- Please, Sir, they're my wife's.
Tell it to Sgt. Major.
Those letters, Sir, please they're my wife's.
- I'll tell you when to speak.
So that's the way your
bloody mind works, is it?
Thought you'd contaminate His Majesty's
prison with fornicating pictures, did you?
Sir?  - Thought we'd let you keep
them for pin-ups, I suppose,
you dirty minded animal.
Staff!  What's this?
- Tell it to Sgt. Major.
Sgt. Major!
- Shut up.
Staff!
Right let's have your names. You?
132 Private McGrath, Sir.
You?
- 1036 Private King, Sir.
929 Private Stevens, Sir.
You?
- 824 Private Bartlett, Sir.
421 Trooper Roberts, Sir.
So you're Roberts, eh?
- Yes, Sir.
My guess is Willie, Sir, he's my pal.
I bet he put those postcards in my kit.
He planted them on you?
- That's Willy, Sir,
always dropping me in it.
Your charge sheet says you stole
three bottle of whisky from the Sgt's mess.
And weren't you charged
with being drunk too?
- My unlucky day, Sir.
- I make the jokes here.
When you've served your sentence,
you'll be arrested at the gates
and charged with having in your
possession obscene photographs.
Now you can start laughing.
Watch it.  Watch it.
You stole ten motor vehicle tyres.
Yes, Sir.
What did you do with them?
Well, I flogged them, Sir.
- To the enemy?
No, to the wogs, Sir.
And what do you call them,
your little friends?
Sold them guns too, have you?
- No, Sir.
You would if you had a chance.
How many times have
you been inside, now?
- Nine, Sir.
- Just about due for
your pension, eh?
When d'you last see action?
Action, Sir, eh, let me see...
- You never seen any!
-Well, I never quite got round to it.
- No, you didn't did you.
- It's the luck of the game, Sir.
- Bartlett, let me tell you...
that the front line is going to be a damn
sight more comfortable than here.
Understand?
You're a fighting man, McGrath?
- Yes, Sir.
Well, see, you assaulted three
members of the Corps of Military Police?
- Yes, Sir.
- Seen any other action apart from that?
- If you're asking if I'm a coward, Sir...
- We'll soon know the answer to that.
- Well, I didn't flog tyres to the
enemy or sell dirty postcards
on the streets of Cairo.
- No, you got boozed up...
and tried to obstruct the police.
- I don't need a drink before...
- You're kind always needs a drink!
McGrath, I've a dozen like you inside here.
They all came in here thinking
they were gonna run this place.
Just doubled a couple of them out.
Went absent, Stevens?
- Yes, Sir.
Didn't fancy the sound of gunfire?
- Wasn't that, Sir, I was...
Tried to stow away on a
boat leaving for England.
- Well, I was trying to get home
you see, Sir.  It was because...
- Not very smart of you, Stevens.
The smart thing to do is to go to the airport,
give a Yank twenty quid and he'd
fly you to Hong Kong if you wanted it.
- No, it was home I wanted, Sir
- Missing your wife, Stevens?
- Yes, Sir.
- If every man who wanted a cuddle
and a little bit of loving
kindness took off for England
there wouldn't be any bloody army
left over here, now, would there?
- No, Sir.
- You're out of place here, Stevens.
Obey orders. Get out as soon as you can.
- Thankyou, Sir.
Roberts.
- Sir.
Your Commanding Officer
gave you an order,
he ordered you to fight.  So you
knocked his teeth out.  Is that right?
Yes, Sir.
- Is that all you got to say?
Sir, it's all I want to say.
- See that hill?
- I noticed it as I came in.
We built it special.
A few tonnes of sand and rock and
a lot of labour and sweat.
The prisoners built it.
Well, that's marvelous, Sir.
It's a great construction feat.
Something tells me you're
going to get to know it well.
I don't want any special privileges.
- It's hot on that hill, hot!
Fancied I saw snow
on the top when I came in.
Dead set on having a go at it, aren't you?
I can do without it, Sir but I
think you've got other plans for me.
King!
- Sir!
Would you like to drill with these men?
- Anything you order, I can do, Sir.
Pity that I won't see it.
You can't drill with them, you're black.
I already know that, Sir.
- I only take notice of one thing, the book.
King's Rules & Regulations laid down
in black and white that Hottentots,
Basuto's, Voodoo boys and sons of
witch doctors do their square bashing
separate and away from white men!
I am a British subject from the West Indies.
- You're black.
That makes me happy when
I see some white men, Sir.
Don't answer back you
different-coloured bastard.
Man, I spit.
- Staff.
- Sir!
Over here, see if the MO's
ready to inspect these men.
Sir!
So you're a British subject, eh?
- Yes.
- Yes, what?
- Yes, Sir!
Then you have equal privileges.
You can drill with these men,
and you can dance over that hill with them.
Be my pleasure, Sir.
6 prisoners present and correct, Sir!
14 prisoners present and correct, Sir!
16 prisoners present and correct, Sir!
16 prisoners present and correct, Sir!
18 prisoners all present and correct, Sir!
5 new prisoners all present and correct, Sir!
18 prisoners all present and correct, Sir!
Now, if any of you are
excused boots, pack drill, breathing,
have six toes, two heads or
a dose of the clap; are pidgeon-chested,
wall-eyed, or still have to
be breast fed, speak up now.
That's my set-piece and it always gets a laugh.
Ready for medical inspection, Sir.
King!  Fall out, double over to the MO's room.
So you're the busted
Sgt. Major, are you?  Eyes front!
I'll bet your boys loved you.
How many of them died for you, Roberts?
Some of them died... fighting.
Don't give me the big hero stuff.
You got busted for cowardice, cowardice!
Eyes front!
Not a swattie in the Middle East
has not heard about you.
And what are you supposed to be?
A brave man on a permanent base job?
Next!
Stevens, fall out and double away will you.
Medical inspection.  Man!
They only pays that crazy doctor to inspect...
- No talking!
How he gonna know I A-1 by
only just looking at my secret weapon?
I told you no talking.
King, Roberts, you're on charge.
Staff, he didn't speak!
Don't answer back.
Staff, you charge me, that man didn't speak.
King, you're a dead cert
for bread and water
if you don't stop flapping
that big trap of yours.
I told you, Staff, he didn't speak.
Why don't you shut up.
- Alright, McGrath.
Well, I don't want them
two dropping me in it.
Next, Staff!
-Yes, Sir!
Alright, McGrath, fall out.
What the hell are you doing, Stevens?
Now cut out this bashful virgin act.
Double it up.  Left, right, left, right... Halt!
Now, you two had a great
time of it with the Sgt. Major
but I'm taking care
of your welfare from now on.
And I tell you here and now I hate the
bloody sight of the pair of you!
Next, Staff!
- Sir!
Bartlett, fall out and double over.
Move, move, move!
One of these shy lads are you, Stevens?
Well?  Well?
You what?
One of these cads who can't make
up his mind whether he's a boy or a girl?
- I'm married, Sir.
- Are you, now?
And who's who in your little partnership?
We don't have to be treated like
that, do we?  I mean...
- Eyes front!
- ...we're not animals.
Haven't made up my mind whether
you're fish or foul yet, Stevens.
Staff!
- Sir!
I want this one scrubbed with
a yard broom, it's blacker than a darkie!
Next, Staff!
Roberts!  Double!  Move it!
Halt!  Hats off!  Inside!
This is Roberts, Sir.
Take your shirt off.
Any serious illnesses?
Do you mean recently, Sir?
Any time.
Smokers cough.
Drop your trousers.
Anything else?
Like what?
Any recent incapacities.
Well, I wouldn't brag
about it if I had, Sir.
Roberts, in this place it pays to
give a plain answer to a simple question.
Try learning that golden rule.
Turn around.
Right get dressed.
Then I'm fit, Sir?
Yes.
Where are you sending me?
To a stud farm?
Roberts, I give you one week.
Just one week.  Now, get out.
Yes, Sir.
Attention!  Stand a ease!...
Staff.
- Sir.
I suggest you take the
prisoners on a short excursion.
Sir.
To the hill, Staff.  I suggest you
take them to the hill.
Let them walk around it,
inspect it at their leisure,
then take them up and
down it, say, half a dozen times,
no more, just half a dozen times.
But not Roberts, Staff.
- Not Roberts, Sir?
Not Roberts, give him half an hour.
That's plenty. Just half an hour.
Carry on, Staff.
- Sir.
Detail, pick up your kits.
Move, move, move!
Stand still!
Roberts, you're idle on parade,
you're on another charge.
Remainder, three paces forward, march!
Left turn!
By the front, quick march!  Left, right, left, right...
You're a clever bag of tricks you are, Roberts.
Not inside glass house half an hour
and you use your bloody influence
to get us a ride on the hill.
I bet that's one Saturday night booze
up your Father's always regretted.
Roberts!  You listening to me?
If the ride on the hill leaves any marks
on me I'll leave a bloody few on you.
Halt!  Left turn!  Stand still!
The hill.
Right turn!  By the front, double march!
Detail, halt!  Stand still!
Left turn!
This is the North face gentlemen.
I mean ladies and gentlemen.
On a clear day you can see Mother India.
Still patches of snow on the top, Roberts?
- Damn funny hill, nothing seems to grow on it.
- It's full of surprises!
The only thing that's been known to grow on
that hill is soldiers.  They grow weary.
Now we're gonna double up it.
By the right, double march!
About turn!  Double!
Move it!
Right fall in.  Fall in.
Stand still.  Come on get down.
Pick up your dressing.
Stand still.
Right detail, stand at ease!
Not you, Roberts.
Right, take your towels out.
Not you, Roberts.
You're gonna continue doubling, Roberts.
About turn!  Double march!
Take them away, Staff.
Right, get your clothes off.  Get in.
Double!
Bloody lovely!
Double!
Right, change clothes,
lay out your kit and be smart about it.
It's filthy!
Double.
- That's enough, Staff.
- Yes, Sir.
Walk him, or lift him;
put him in the shade and rest him.
My picture got wet.  It's my wife.
She looks like a very nice girl.
Jean, that's her name.
Looks too good for you, Stevens.
- Give us a decko.
- Go carefully, it's still wet.
- Wouldn't mind half an hour with her, eh?
- Come on, give me it.
Hold on, hold on.  I just want to have a shuftie.
What's her legs like?  I can't see her legs.
- No, come on, give it to me.
What's she got stuck up her jumper?
A couple of barrage balloons, eh?
She's not a bad old bit, is she?
- Give the photo back!
Alright, alright.
What's going on here?
Sounds like a monkey house,
looks like a monkey house,
smells like a monkey house!
Didn't I tell you to smarten it up?
Alright, get your mess tins and get into line.
Come on put a move on, move it!
There's porridge, Stevens you skiver!
Come on, come on, come on.
Left turn, left!  Double march!
Staff Williams.
- Key, Staff.
What about my grub, then?
Nails out, come on, hold your nails out.
Ration correct?  - Breads a bit short, Sir
- Weigh it.
It's overweight, cut a bit off.
Correct?  Correct?
-Yes, Sir.
Come on, get those knees up!
Staff, I'll see to them.
What about my grub?
- You missed it, didn't you.
D'you like that hill, Roberts?
Roberts, the court martial broke you
but I'm gonna finish the job.
I'm gonna bust you wide open.
- I've got your number.
You'd work as a dustman if they gave you
a uniform and a couple of men to yell at.
D'you think that's funny?
- Well, no, I was...
I'll teach you, and everybody
else.  Get into your kit.
Move it!
I'll teach you, and that
goes for the rest of you.
Move it I said!  Double outside!
You dropped that little lad
right in it, didn't you Roberts.
Yeah, we're gonna be next if he
don't keep his big trap shut.
Don't make things worse
than they are, Roberts.
Look!  He wants me.
And he wants you
cos you're the wrong colour.
The rest of you he doesn't
find all that interesting yet,
but he'll have you just the same.
The RSM likes making toy soldiers,
Williams likes braking them.
Now you all work out what
you're gonna do about it.
Maybe you're right,
but keep your big mouth shut
and don't give him too many opportunities.
How come you put one
on you Officer, Roberts?
He asked for it.
For ordering you up
the line, you mean?
For ordering me up the line.
Wasn't very considerate, was he?
Should've ordered you to a rest home.
I'd have volounteered for that.
You know, there's a yarn going round
that you beat up your Officer
and then ordered your lads out the line.
- Is that the story?
- That's what I heard.
It's true I stuck it on him.
- Why, Roberts?
Oh, you'll read all about
it when I write my memoirs.
How Joe Roberts saw action one
day and didn't fancy a second basin?
Well, I'll try and make it
read a bit better than that.
How's this?
Half the Regiment wiped out
but not gallant Sgt. Major Joe Roberts?
Couldn't have that, you see,
I was due weeks leave in Cairo.
The lads who'd gone in,
any of them still alive, Roberts?
Any of them still alive, Roberts?
- I am.
Now back off, enough.  Leave us!
There'll be no more fighting!
Ain't we in trouble enough
already?
So chuck this in!
Alright, I'll find a quiet
corner to finish the job off.
McGrath, you try that again and I'll kill you.
Williams is gunning for you...
maybe I'll just leave it to him.
You're a real thick nut, soldier.
You'd shoot up kids in the next
street if you was ordered to.
I told you, chuck it in, man, chuck it in!
Staff!
- Watch it.
I hope you lot can put
up a better show than that.
Well, who knocked you about, Roberts?
- I bumped into the wall.
Who was it?
Like he said, Staff,
bumped into the wall.
If you keep bumping into walls, Roberts,
let me know who's pushing you.
I won't stand for any
punch-up artists, McGrath!
Alright, Staff.
Right, into your kit
the lot of you.  Move it!
Get Stevens up.
- Yes, Staff.
He's in no fit state for a second helping.
Move it outside at the double!
Get in line!
Sgt. Major fancies he has the
patent on how to make soldiers.
I'm gonna prove it to him and to you lot
that I've got it aswell.  Eyes front!
Left turn!  By the front, double march!
Halt!  Stand still!  Right turn!
Come on, out of it you four.
Come on, move!
Back into order.  Move!
Come on, ________.
Detail, by the right, double march!
Staff!  Man fainted!
Go on, up you go.
Double, Roberts, move it.
Staff, take over.
Fill them up again.
Come in.  Hello, Charlie.
Hello, Bert.
Sweetie?
- Thanks.
Thought you ought to know, Bert,
Williams has got all the
mob from cell 8 on the hill.
Has he?
Including the lad he had on it a while ago.
-Well?
I don't think the lad's up to it, Bert.
I bet you were good to your Mother.  And
I know you're too good to the prisoners.
Getting idle, your men are.
Next thing, you'll be having them in the
mess for a Saturday night booze up.
Think I'm losing my touch?
- Losing your touch, Bert.
25 years service and you'd think
you's know your job.
And you do.
You think you can make soldiers
out of muck and you can.
I've got an easy way with you, Charlie,
but don't come the old soldier with me.
Stevens is A-1 fit for punishment.
Bert, honest, he doesn't look
that way right now, look.
It's here in black and white.
The MO passed him fit.
Now get out, or I'll have you doubling
with your little mates.
Woh, not over that hill.
Even you wouldn't
get me over that hill, eh?
Water!  Over here!
Right, son,
on your feet, lad.  Double.
You, dowse him.
Roberts!  On your feet lad, double.
On your feet and double!
Dowse him!
Staff, he's crazy.
- I said dowse him!
Right you bastards, fall in.
Move it!
Stand still!
Prisoners, by the front!
By the front, double march!
Obeying orders, he won't beat me.
Thankyou, Staff.
Carry on, Staff.
- Staff.
- Staff.
Thought you might like a night cap, Sir.
Goodnight, Sir.
Staff, Staff, It's me.
It's Jacko Staff.
Staff, It's Jacko.
Yeah, it's Jacko, Staff.
And I'm still up on my feet.
Staff, it's Jacko.
You different-coloured bastard.
Staff, Staff, you want
to take me out again, Staff?
You can't beat Jacko, Staff.
Oh no, no man can beat Jacko, Staff.
No man can beat Jacko, Staff.
Darkie, go to your bed!
Okay, Okay.
- Alright, I'm ready for another basin.
Oh, get into your bed.
Who you shouting orders at?
I can do it again.
Anytime.  Williams won't beat me
Sand happy bastards, it's night!
It's not the sun, it's the Gestapo lamp!
Get your kits off...  Give him a hand.
Steady.
- Careful.
Ah, get your shirt off.
Stevens, here.
Okay?
There you go.
Look at Monty!
Hey, you're a wide boy, aren't you.
All these wogs are a load of cobblers.
Monty, the screw puts you over
the hill if he catches you smoking.
And it's Commandant's inspection today!
Three hours standing to instead of doubling!
Some rest, all day long in the blazing sun.
I'll tell you one thing,
they won't fault my
equipment, it's perfect.
Here, but Stevens can't go on
parade with his kit like this.
Well, he'll get the stick
for it then, won't he?
A Section all present and correct, Staff!
B Section all present and correct, Staff!
C Section all present and correct, Staff!
D Section all present and correct, Staff!
A Company all present and correct, Staff!
B Company all present and correct, Staff!
A Wing all present and correct, Sir!
Carry on, Staff.
B Wing all present and correct, Sir!
Carry on, Staff.
Staff!  Stand the prisoners... at ease!
A Wing, stand at ease!
B Wing, stand at ease!
Five minutes rest, half an hours attention.
Don't half crease you, don't it.
We're all doing time, even the screws.
All prisoners present and correct, Sir!
Stevens, your kits a
blinding wonder, lad.
You'll have RSM jealous.
Take his name.
- His name, Staff.
Whitewash!
- Whitewash!
- Whitewash!
One pace forward, march!
Left turn!
What d'you clean your kit with, lad?
Whitewash, Staff!
The Commandant knows you use
whitewash, the RSM knows, I know,
but you don't have to be a
dosy lad and own up to it.
Double march!  Take over, Staff!
Left wheel!
Whitewash, Roberts!  You're too clever,
Roberts, that's your trouble.
Stevens' kit was dirty, Mac, he was
bound to get some stick anyway.
He's still too clever, Jacko.
Too damn clever by half.
When it dries out,
look as good as new, lad.
Better!
Broken the King's heart if the
RSM phoned him and told him
you'd been defacing his walls, you know.
Would it, Staff?
Son, you shouldn't be
in here, you know.
You shouldn't even be in the army.
We had a queer in here a few weeks back.
- I'm not queer!
I know you're not, why don't you listen!
That nanny had a way with her.
She sang and she laughed all day.
Put her over the hill and she
went into a dance routine.
Better than those belly
dancers in the cabarets.
She wasn't any stronger than
you but she knew how to survive
and that's what you've
got to learn in this army,
You gotta learn how to... you know...
...how to survive.
Seem to have smartened up
the prisoners some today, Staff.
- Thankyou, Sir.
And what about Stevens, eh?
Yes, Sir, I missed that, Sir, didn't think
Stevens would try it on, Sir.
He wouldn't, somebody put him up to it.
I'll take them all out, Sir,
and we'll find the right man.
Oh Christ!
Knocked the rocks over,
haven't you, lad.
Pick them up again.
Very pretty, Roberts.  Very pretty.
Roberts.
King, double!
Right, King, you're
in charge.  I said double!
Come on, Bartlett, up you go, lad.
- I don't think I'll be able to do this, Staff.
- Of course you will, lad, come along.
- You'll have to excuse me if I can't.
- No, no.
-Get up it, Bartlett!
- Come on, Bartlett,
let's have you, get up it!
- I can't, I'm not built
for this sort of ...
- Get up it, Bartlett!
- Please, Staff!
- Bartlett, get up it!
- I can't, Staff!
- Get up it, Bartlett!
- I'm fat!  I'm fat!
You all know, don't you!
Halt!  Still!  Left turn!
Stevens, you are a dead bloody loss.
Put it on.
Hurry it up!
Double march!
I only wanted to go home.
I can't stand any more.
I can't take any more.
God help me!
Will you shut up!
- Lay off!
Well, if he goes on like that
we'll have the Padre in next
thinking he's got a new customer.
He can't take that hill.
Stevens.  Stevens!
Please don't!
I don't wanna do anymore.
I just want to lay down.
Listen, Roberts.  Roberts!  If he's sick,
he goes on sick parade and you get
a screws permission to bed him down.
Yeah, you're not dropping us in it again.
- That's right, Joe.
Staff!  Staff, we've got a sick man in here!
Alright, that's enough.
Williams has had him on the
hill, now you get the vet!
Staff!
I want out from these lunatics, Staff!
Bed the lad down, Roberts.
You want something, Staff?
Yes, I'd like a word with you.
This is my cell, I'm responsible here.
- I'm not, thank God.
- Then leave it to me.
- You've got a sick man in here.
- I can deal with it.
- I've given instructions to bed him down.
- If you don't get out sharp, Staff,
I'll put you on report and let the RSM
decide what's right or not.
So. I can organize something, a visit
from the MO, see what he's got to say.
McGrath, what's wrong with him?
I'm not a vet, Staff.
Right, get your towels.
We've all had a busy time
so I'm putting you under the showers
to sweeten you up and smarten you up.
And we're taking Stevens with us.
- Yes, Staff, thankyou very much indeed, Staff.
- Well get him on his feet!  Get him up, Bartlett!
- Yes, Staff.
Come on, Staff wants you up.
- No, please!
- Staff wants you ups-a-daisy.
On your feet!
- He's in no fit state to walk.
So he's in a terrible
way is he?  We'll soon see.
Double over here, Stevens.
Please, Joe.
Make him leave me alone
Please help me.
I can't take it anymore.
Alright, Stevens.
Very touching.
I'll get the preacher into
you two and get you married.
Right, double outside, outside!
Drag that fairy out.
If I'd known you were on your honeymoon
I would've had you in a separate cell.
I don't hold about one of my Staff
complaining about a brother Officer.
Listen, Bert.  If Williams cripples Stevens
you'll take the can back, not Williams, you know.
You telling me again
how to run this place?
If I have any more complaints out
of you I'll have you posted.
Sir, I suggest you let the MO decide
whether or not Stevens is fit for punishment.
I make the decisions.  Me!
I'll see if he's fit or not!
Now, get out!
Right, McGrath.
- Eh, not that one!
- You what?
- That turns on the gas.
Quiet.
What's this I hear about Stevens, Mr Wilson?
- Oh, nothing to worry about, Sir.
Well, Staff Harris told me...
- Harris!  He's like a dream walking.
If Stevens was sick he'd
be here wouldn't he, Sir?
Well, yes.  I suppose so.
Well, since I'm here I better see him.
Think I don't know my job, Sir?
Think I don't know what's going on?
- I never said that.
- I know what Staff Williams is doing.
- Well, Staff Harris told me...
- Harris!
He's sand happy.
I'm still in charge here, Sir.
I want to see Stevens.
- You've seen him, Sir.
What d'you mean?
You passed him fit.
Fit for duty and punishment.
The hill, Sgt. Major.  If one of the
Staff over does the good work.
I could take it, Sir.
Any fit man could take it, Sir.
Yes, well.  As you say if he was
sick he'd be here, wouldn't he?
God, it's hot!  It's like an oven in here!
Lights out, five minutes!
Still no sign of the MO, eh?
- No.
He looks better.
- Yeah.
Maybe Harris'll get
the vet tomorrow.
It's a laugh.
- What is?
Well, all we ever get in this
dump is medicine and duties.
One lunatic, you know, in Tunifia,
that was a right nick, that was,
he made his blankets up into
a kind of a nest, you see,
and he sat there all
night in the middle of them,
going cuckoo, cuckoo all night long.
- He was trying to work his ticket.
No, he was round the bend.  He'd been
frightened by an hand grenade, I think.
Anyway, the screw got
the vet in, you see
and you know what the vet recommended?
Medicine and duties.
Anyway, the vet had a bright
idea, you see.  He sort of fancied himself
a bit of a trick cyclist,
and he put this dummy hand grenade
into the nest with the cuckoo.
And you know what the cuckoo done?
Aye, tried to hatch it out.
You've heard it.
Anyway, you've got to laugh, you know,
cos some of these screws are comics.
I mean, take Williams.  There's
Stevens there, on his chin straps,
all Williams can think of doing is
giving him the old 'Attention!',
'About turn!', 'Double march!'
Blimey, he's off.
About turn!
I wonder if he could hatch out a packet
of Players for one of my butt ends, eh?
Here, Stevens, that's it,
you stick at it, kidder!
You're a cert for
your ticket, you are.
Left turn!
Keep 'em up, boy, keep 'em up!
About turn!
He's dead.
The MO'll have to write out
a death certificate, won't he.
What will he diagnose?
Carelessness?
- What's that?
- Careless of Stevens to drop dead?
A bit late for you jokes, Charlie.
Word got around yet?
- It will, Bert.
Might be some trouble.
We'd all better be on our toes.
I'd like to make a suggestion.
- Yes?
Move Williams out of the block.
Put him in the gate where
he can't do so much damage.
But that would be as good as
admitting I think williams killed the lad.
Bert, I'd sooner have Williams
doubling in here than anybody.
Listen.  I ordered Williams to smarten
up the prisoners in cell 8.
Yes, we all accept that, Bert.
- If Stevens was fit he'd still be here, wouldn't he?
The army judged him A-1 and the
MO passed him fit for punishment.
Looks like Stevens was only fit to drop.
- That's not your worry, it's the MO's.
Thankyou, Bert.
You said you backed your Staff.
We ain't celebrating a
glorious victory, Williams.
We're patching up a bloody disaster.
You realize I'll have to make a full report?
- Yes, Sir.
He was perfectly fit when I examined him.
- When you did what, Sir?
Well when I...
Well, when I examined him.
You only looked at his watch and chain.
Now look here Sgt. Major.
- You passed him fit so I handed
him over to Staff Williams.
He was...
Well, he was kept out in the
sun too long.  I checked on his records.
Base job in an office.
Well, anybody could see that.
Suddenly he's drilling for hour
after hour in the blazing sunshine.
Well, it was fatal in his case.
Sounds like an accidental death, Sir.
- Yes.
The man was A-1, but to come
from a base job to this place!
- You do understand these
things better than me, Sir.
Accidental death, that's
what I thought, Sir.
- Well I hope so.
- I've dented a few, Sir,
but I've never murdered any.
- I wasn't refering to you.
- That goes for my Staff too, Sir.
Goodnight, Sir.
Accidental death.
But if there's another accidental death and
you're in any way connected with it, Staff...
Waiting to find out what
Williams' gonna pull next,
is like waiting to go into action.
You know the feeling?
I'm the fella who refused
to go in, remember me?
You beat up your Officer
because he ordered the boys in?
Yeah, that's right, cos he
ordered the boys in.
Was he going in his self?
- No.
I took them in.  And right
away we lost half our tanks.
So I pulled the boys out.
I put the Major in the picture,
told him the situation was hopeless,
that if their mines didn't get us,
Gerry's anti-tank guns would.
What the Major say?
Get back in.
He was very calm about it.
He said that he had his orders.
And the next thing I knew the
boys were playing me off him.
Man.  There's too many
people in this army
giving the wrong orders.
Somebody got to have the guts to
cancel some of them damn wrong orders.
We'd have no bloody army
left if we didn't obey orders.
Joe?
You feel pretty bad about this, huh?
Look, it's not just disobeying orders,
it's rules, regulations, leave...
But, man, you saved all them boys
from getting killed for nothing.
The Troop Sgt. took them in.  I was put
under close arrest.  None of them came back.
Bloody cockroaches!
As if we haven't got enough to suffer
without you two talking half the night.
Can't you let a man sleep?
You ain't been sleeping
much yourself, Joe.
- No.
- Another stinking hot day.
Practically hear it boiling already.
Look at Monty.  Flat out.
Wake up!
Who done that?
- I did.
You wanna watch it mate!
You just wanna watch it!
Somebody ought to write
to their MP about this dump.
Yeah, why don't you?
- What him?  I bet he can't even write.
What's so clever about
being able to write, then?
The secret in this old world,
mate, is to use your loaf.
Maybe I can't read.
But when it comes to knocking off
stuff I'm away out in front on my own.
I'll bet you are.
You're a fair sample
of the no-talent class.
Thieving three bottles
of whiskey, blimey.
I didn't thieve them, man.
I drank them.
Bet he can't write neither.
Monty, just because I'm black,
do I have to be damn ignorant too?
You blacks ain't got the brains of us whites.
Listen to that, man!
You got it downstairs, mate,
but we got it upstairs.
Live up trees, you blokes do.
I seen a film about his tribe once.
It was called Tarzan and the Ape-men.
When Charlie Bloggs found you lot,
you was walking around, starkers,
living on monkey nuts.
So this is a member of the great white
race?  And there's plenty like Monty.
We just call them 'white trash'.
Now look, I don't go for
that expression, 'white trash'.
What's Staff Williams?
- Belt up!
We don't wanna hear about Williams.
- That I can believe.
I'm making a report about Williams.
Now listen, Roberts.
We're all aware of what happened,
but there's nothing we can do about it.
- Yeah.
- So...
- It's a pity about our Stevens.
- ...we're all in sympathy?
He had a rough deal.
So I can count on you when
we go to see the Commandant?
To enquire after his health or what?
- Aye, but of course,
and then we'll slap a
murder charge against Williams.
Wakey, wakey!  Rise n' shine!
- Who killed Stevens?
You hear that!
And now you're gonna sit on
your jacksies and do nothing?
Take over, Staff!
Staff, what the hell's going on here?
Sir!  The prisoners!
- Sounds like victory celebrations.
Get every available Staff, eh, at the double.
- Armed, Sir?
Where the hell d'you think you are, Chicago?
Staffs!  Let them out!
I said let them out!
Stevens!  Stevens!  Stevens!...
Stevens!  Stevens!  Stevens!...
What's your name, Oliver Twist?
Put that mess tin down,
it's too early for breakfast.
What's your name?
Stevens!
Staff Burton!
- Sir!
We've got a miracle.  Here's
a man returned from the dead.
Take him back to the mortuary.
- Mortuary, Sir?
- To the mortuary, via the hill.
Give him a last good
run before we bury him.
Double him away.
Left, right, left, right...
Staff!
- Sir!
Double away and get me
a copy of the K-R's.
- Sir!
Name?
- Johnson, Sir.
Did you start the mutiny?
- I didn't start anything.
Then what was all the noise in
here of excercising your lungs?
Who killed Stevens?
Staff!
- Sir!
Double this man out to the
mortuary.  Show him the body.
If he finds any marks, abrasions or
bullet wounds on the body,
take him over to the Commandants
office and stay with him
while he writes out his statement.
Then let him see the Commandant
on his own so he can speak freely.
- Yes, Sir.
- Double out.
Double, move!  Left, right, left, right...
Now, you've all been
making a hell of racket.
There'll be no more of it, or
I'll let the lot of you over the hill,
every damn one of you!
Now, if you've any complaints,
you're free to see the Commandant.
(Whistling, jeering).
Any more trouble,
and I'll read you the Riot Act.
You know how longer it takes.
And if that doesn't have any effect
I'll charge the ringleaders with mutiny.
- Who's the ringleaders?
- Every fifth man!
Think that over.  I don't waste
my breath on idle threats.
Now, let's have you
looking like soldiers.
Prisoners!  Attention!
Stand at ease, let's try that again.
Attention!  Better.
Now, any man here got any complaints?
Anybody wanna see the Commandant?
Anybody witness any murders recently?
Scared to open your traps or what?
Anybody wishing to see the
Commandant step forward.
Why do you want to see him?
I wish to report, Sir,
Staff Williams responsible
for Stevens' death.
Witnesses!
All the men in my cell
know what happened, Sir.
Bartlett, double over here.
You saw Staff Williams murder
Private Stevens, is that right?
No, Sir.  Never saw nothing of the kind.
Don't lie to me, lad.  You saw red,
blood stained hands, didn't you now?
No, Sir.  Never saw it.
Sir, request to be moved to another cell.
Request refused, get back into line.
McGrath, double over here.
Is it right you saw murder committed McGrath?
No, Sir.
But I'll be committing one if
Roberts doesn't stop squawking.
Double back.
King, double over here.
Now, let's hear from you, King.
Staff Williams murdered Stevens alright.
My only worry is how we gonna prove it.
Double away, King.
Staff Williams!
- Yes, Sir!
Did you hear that?
- Yes, Sir!
Serious allegation, that is.
He's lying, Sir.  I never
laid a finger on Stevens.
Staff Harris!
- Sir!
I want Roberts and King on
Commandants parade 0930 hours,
and notify the Medical Officer
he's wanted at the Commandants office,
0930 hours.
Seems Stevens didn't die of sunstroke.
He was murdered! In cold blood!
Is that right, Sir?
Tell him be sure to be there.
His professional reputation's at stake.
Our MO, Sir?  I won't wear that!
It's well known he can make
the lame walk, the blind see
and the maimed dance over the hill.
What else can he do, Staff?
Ride a bicycle on the sea, no-hands
and turn water into wine, Sir!
But can he raise the dead, Staff?
- No, Sir.  He can't raise
them but he can lower them.
Yes, I got your vocation placed, now!
You should've been a music hall comic!
Yes, Sir.  Permission to organize a
smoking concert for the prisoners?
You've organized too bloody
many already, Charlie!
Think I don't know?
- Got a light, Sir?
- No,
but I've got a pack to put on
your back if I catch you smoking.
Bartlett and McGrath, stand by
for a call, you may be needed.
Now.
You'll all be having
cheese with your lunch today!
Now, get back into your
cells and look sharp about it.
We've all had a lovely time.
Staffs, tighten 'em up.
Staff Harris!
Trying to get at me, eh, Charlie?
- Who me?
Yes, from now you will take
your orders from Williams.
So that's the way it is.
I know you won't mind.
You're always bragging you don't
seek promotion or favours.
I'd sooner be out of it, Sir, well out of it.
You're getting passed over, Staff.
Inside, King.
Think you can get away with this?
- I should be asking you that.
Thankyou, Staff.
You know what the outcome will be.
There'll be a court of
inquiry and I'll be exonerated.
Nah, you're getting nervous, Williams.
You want me don't you?
You fancy your chances.
You make a move and I'll drop you.
Not a bad idea, just us two.
There's a solitary at the end,
nobody can see into that.
I'll lock inside, Roberts, just us two.
- You're on.
- March over.
Me first.
Inside!
Let go.  Go back to your
duties, go on, double away.
I want no more trouble.
No more out of you.
You'll learn discipline.
Learn we mean business.
You better do some quick
thinking, Roberts.  - Staff,
I want a transfer out of here.
You're going out, Bartlett,
you little runt.  Out over the hill!
Now get your packs on all of you!
And get Roberts up, he's coming with us.
Be back for you.  You got five minutes.
Joe's on Commandant's orders.
How's Williams gonna explain this?
You think the Commandant's never set eyes
on a prisoner that's been done over before?
I got something to say about this.
And I'll make damn sure he listens.
If not, I'm getting word outside.
You two are enough to drive a fella up the wall.
Somebody's got to find out what's
going on in here, what's happening.
We're inside Sgt. Major, inside!
-I'll get word outside, I'll tell you that.
The bloody world outside doesn't give a damn.
-They've got to find out what's happening.
We're the horrible two percent.
The dodgy boys, the spivs,
the cowards, the thieves.
We're the weak chain in the system.
Oh, to hell with you.
Into your kit, Roberts.
No, not for you, Williams.
Right, two volounteers to drag Roberts
over the hill.  You Bartlett, you McGrath.
Yes, Staff.
McGrath!
To hell with this!
- I'm giving you an order, McGrath.
Listen, Williams.  The army
didn't buy me in a slave market.
I'll double over the hill for you.
But I'll not drag another man with me.
Right, I'll get all the volounteers
I want and have the lot of you out.
He's barmy.  I got to get out of this lot.
- Shut up!
Well, what's the matter with you, then?
Joe, tell him, go on.
I'll obey any order.
I'm not looking for no trouble.
Get!
Staff!  Staff, I got to get out of here!
- Now what's going on?
Staff, they're crucifying me.
- Move him Staff.
Get your small kit and report to the MO.
- No.
I'm on Commandant's
orders and I'm not missing that.
Let me see this.
King, McGrath, carry him over to the MO.
I'll see you see the Commandant, don't worry.
Come on, sharpish!  Hurry up!
Easy with him, now, easy.
Right, watch that clinch on the door.
Lower your head a little.
- Put me in another cell, Staff.
I've had a bellyful of this lot.
- Ah, clear off.
I'm only looking after number one, ain't I?
What's the matter with
everybody in this bloody place?
Not here, Staff.  They've gone.
Staff Harris has taken them over to the MO.
Punishment detail,
about turn!  Double march!
Easy.  Get him over here.
What's this, Staff?
Roberts is reporting sick.
Double outside you two.
Okay, double out.
On your feet, Roberts.
Jerk him out of it, Staff.
- He's got a busted foot.
What the hell are you
two doing outside here?
It's Joe Roberts, Sir, he's poorly.
On your feet.
- He's got a foot injury, Sir.
On your feet, Roberts,
and stand to attention.
March outside.
Keep marching.  Double inside, you two.
- Come on, double in.
Halt!
About turn!
Para. 528, Section 7:
An Officer will not reprove
a Warrant Officer or an NCO
in the presence or
hearing of Private soldiers.
You know the K-R-R's, don't you?
- Yes, Sir.
You're breaking every rule in the book!
- And you live by it, don't you.
We're both regulars.  We are the army, what
the hell else are we supposed to do?
- Well, I live by the book.  Para. this
and Para-under-section x,y,z, that.
But Queen Victoria's
dead!  It's out of date!
What kind of a soldier are you?
- I'm a live one unless Williams
has got other plans for me.
Discipline!  The army's run on discipline!
I'm a regular soldier because I couldn't
get a bloody job in civvy street.
But I was a good toy clockwork
soldier just like you are.
You throw an order at me and I could pick
it up like a dog picks up a bone.
On your feet and you listen!
- No, you listen!
Three bloody years in the desert,
and people are just fighting to get underpaid,
damn, and that's what we are!
Treason!  You're talking treason!
- Right!
Get on your feet!
- Treason, okay, treason...
That's Para. 531 Section 7:
Any person committing any
traitorous or, eh,
mutinous practice may be, eh,
sentenced to penal servitude
for the term of his natural life.
- So you claim.*
- Life!
Alright, all I know is that I can't do
things that don't make sense to me any more.
You can!  You can
still live by the book.
But it's out of date,
it's stupid and out of date!
So you quit, eh?  Glass house,
permanent for the rest of the war?
- Right!
- You'd sign away our bloody empire?
- Yes!  Give it to Jacko,
maybe he can use it.
- To the niggers?  They
couldn't run a knocking shop!
- Right.
On your feet.  Stand up
and stand still or I'll...
What's the charge?
Failing to obey an order?
Oh no, drunk in charge
of a cigarette lighter?
Oh you crazy bastard.
You'd prop up dead men and
inspect them if you was ordered to!
Right!  You're right!
Keep those men on the move!
You used to be an NCO.
You used to be a soldier.
You've forgotton.
Now I'm gonna teach you.
Teach you from the beginning.
I'll make you into something
the army can be proud of.
You'll double, drill,
do any damn I tell you.
Roberts, you'll be lost, lost!
unless somebody's shouting an order at you!
Staff!
- Sir!
How did Roberts get into this state?
- Been fighting with one
of the prisoners, Sir, McGrath.
- Has he?
- He got stuck into me aswell.
- Did he?  - I took him out of the cell,
gave him the order to double;
he refused and struck me.
We had to restrain him, Sir.
- Any witnesses, Staff?
- Henshaw and Culbey, Sir.
- Hope he didn't beat you up too bad, Staff?
- If Henshaw and Culbey hadn't come along, Sir..
- It's clear Roberts is a dangerous fella
but if you ever have to restrain him again
I don't want him looking like
a battle casualty, understand?
- He come at me and went
smack into the wall, Sir.
- He must have, there's no
other logical explanation.
- McGrath did most of the damage.
- Yes, charge him with fighting
McGrath, Culbey and Henshaw
and with insubordination.
McGrath didn't beat me up.  Williams did!
- Witnesses!
Staff!  From now on I'm
looking after his welfare.
- Sir, I can manage him.
I know you can, Staff,
you're a bloody revelation.
But let me tell you,
this is your last chance.
Beat up another one of my lads
and I'll have you inside here;
and if the prisoners don't cripple you,
I will.  Now get the others over here.
Yes, Sir.  Double over, you two!
Come on, move it!
Halt!  Stand still!
McGrath, you had a fight with
Roberts, is that right?
We had a slight difference.
- And you witnessed it?
- They had a scrap.
- Made a right job of him, didn't you!
I'm not responsible for the state he's in.
- Then who is?
Staff Williams, Sir.
He took Joe out and when
Joe come back he was like that.
Sir, I'll say I know damn well
McGrath aint had nothing to do with it.
Stand to attention when I'm talking to you.
Now, nigger boy,
tell me again, what did you see?
You black ape!  I'm talking to you!
You want to do a dose of solitary?
You stinking, filthy nigger,
answer me!  What did you see?
I'll see you in hell, you, you...
you ruddy useless
Sgt. Major!  In hell!
Look at that!  Dancing about
like a flea-bitten monkey!
Thinks he's still in the jungle!
I'll teach you you're in the British army.
- I quit this stinking army, you hear that!
You loud-mouthed Sgt. Major!
I give up this damn soldiering,
now what you gonna do about it?
Throw every charge in the
book at him, Staff.  - Sir!
But first of all, see that Harris has him
outside the Commandant's office 0930 hours,
the Commandant can hear his case.
- Yes, Sir!  You'll be there, Sir?
No, Staff.  I shall be busy making
arrangements for Stevens' funeral.
You gonna let them shoot their
mouths off and not be there, Sir?
You worried, Staff?
Any cause to be?
I haven't!
Let them shout then I'll have my say.
Right, double away you two.
Left turn!  Double march!  Move it!
Move, move, move!
Come on, double!  Double!  Double!
Ooh, you're a clever boy, you are.
- I quit this army.
Don't be daft.
- Clever boy!
What's the clever thing to do?
Go crawling to Williams the way you do?
- Now just watch your big mouth!
I'll kill that man if he lift one
finger to me, one finger.
Yes, yeah, go on, you're all shout.
- I know how tough you are.
- Now watch you step!
You useless article.  Made in yorkshire,
exported to the Middle East
and marked 'fragile'!
Come on, come on!
You're the big man in the cell,
you're the hero in the cell, come on!
What the hell is this, now?  God damn!
Break it up, break it up.
Come on break it up!
You're on Commandants orders.
Get dressed, King, get outside.
I quit the army!
- Get dressed!
I'm finished with the army
and this is what I think of British justice!
Stark raving bonkers!  Outside, all of you!
King!  What the hell's wrong with you?
I finished with the army
so I don't wear the uniform.
You going in to the Commandant
dressed like this, lad?
Unless you got a top hat and
a bone to put through my nose!
That's the way you white folks
think we does dress back home!
I doubt if anyone remembers.*
Come on then, alright,
double!  Come on, double.
There you are, Roberts.
- What's the verdict?  Medicine and duty?
Go back to your cell, pick up your kit
then I'm recommending you for hospital.
I wouldn't do that, the RSM wouldn't like it.
I decide what's...
-You decide nothing!  You just do what you're told.
Now look here, Roberts.  I'm making
a full report about you.
Well you'd better!  Because I'm
fighting every one of you in this...
dirty, lousy dump.
Every one of you...
every single one of you.
You've had me for a soldier.  Wouldn't
get me in the Boy Scouts after that.
Shut up, lad!
King, attention!
Mr Harris, you may tell Mr Commandant
that Mr Jacko King will see him now.
Regain yourself, lad!
What are you doing?
Get back to work!
Horace, sit down, don't
stand up for me.  I've ________.*
I recommend this brand.
But I cannot recommend
your hotel, Horace.
The service is lousy.
Staff!
- Sir.
He's round the bend, sir,
I can't do anything with him.
So, you... don't like the hotel?
Not since one of the guests died, no.
Staff!  Get this madman out.
Send the RSM to me.
He's making funeral
arrangements, Sir.
What?
- Stevens died, Sir.
- Well why wasn't I told?
- You weren't here.
- Send the RSM to me
the minute he gets back.
Who died?
- George Stevens!
Williams murdered him!
Get this maniac out!  Out!
- Sir!
King, double by the right,
double!  Double!
Double!
Horace.
Williams murdered Stevens.
Don't forget that.  He murdered him!
Right, get back to your details.
Get those prisoners
out of here Staff Harris.
- About turn!  Double march!
Roberts imagines that
he's being persecuted.
Imagines he was beaten
up by one of the Staff, does he?
Even that.
So he was.
What did you say?
- So he was.
You realize I'll have to report that?
Let's hope you do.
If it's true.
- You know it's true.
Yes, Harris, but would you
tell the Commandant that?
Yes, yes I will, I will.
Then there will have to be an inquiry.
You'll have to give evidence.
Yes, I know, but yours is the only evidence
the court will take seriously,
after the RSM's testified that I'm
useless as a Prison Officer,
followed by a screw;
and he can muster Williams...
Of course, I'll need evidence, but this
man's here for striking an Officer.
They'll have a very strong case, Harris.
- Evidence!  If you don't move soon,
you'll have all the
evidence you need, his coffin!
Alright you two, get your kit, you're going
to solitary.  About turn!  Double in!
Come on, move it!
The men are not to come in here, Staff.
- Well my orders, Sir, were...
I'm giving the orders now,
and I have a very serious complaint
against you Williams.
From Roberts, Sir?
- And Staff Harris.
His days are numbered.  I've just
had a word with the Commandant,
and I'll answer any queries as to how I
treat prisoners at the court of inquiry, Sir.
I'll see the other prisoners now.
- In fairness, Sir, send for the RSM before you...
- I'll conduct this my own way.
Have you any complaints?
- Sir, I want you to fix it for me to get posted
out of this cell, Sir, I can't take much
more of this shower, get me out of here, Sir.
You?  You, any complaints?
I falsely confessed to the Commandant
that I half-beat-up Roberts
and that's why I'm going
to solitary.  I'm telling you
the army's had me for a soldier
if something's not done about this.
Right, get out.
I haven't always seen eye
to eye with you, Roberts,
but good luck.
McGrath, watch out for yourself.
Why is this man improperly dressed?
- Refuses to wear King's uniform.
Stand to attention.
Oh no, no man.
I don't recognize the
army or the Officers, I quit.
I said stand to attention.
You're talking to a civilian, Cuthbert!
Give him to me, Sir, I'll teach him!
Joe, you tell me your visiting hours,
I'll come up to see you some time.
Harris, take this lunatic into the corridor
and keep him there until I'm ready for him.
Yes, Sir.  After you, Mr King.
See you later, Joe.
-Okay, Mr King.
Double out!  Double!
Bartlett, move it!
You see what we're up against, Sir?
If you're easy on them,
we won't be able to do a damn
thing with them, will we, Sir?
What the hell are these men doing
idling here in the corridor?
Orders, Sir!
- Who's orders?
- Mo's.
-What's going on here, Sir?
- I'm giving these men a medical.
- On sick report are they, Sir?  Why?
- It's not your place to
question me, Sgt. Major
- As soon as you've passed
them fit, I want them, Sir.
- I've had complaints
about Williams' treatment...
- Prisoners complaining?
We get that sometimes.
King just tried it.  Walked in.
  Walked in, mind you,
on the Commandant, half naked,
dressed in his tribal feathers!
What kind of a bloody fool are
you trying to make of me, Sir?
-The complaint against Williams
came from Staff Harris.
Harris?
What've you told him?
- I told him the truth, Sir.
The truth!  What the hell
are you talking about?
It's not your fault, Sir, it's Williams
- Affects me, me!  Who the hell runs this place?
Retract all you said, Charlie!
-Put your finger on him, Bert, get him.
- You telling me again how to
run this place, are you?
Outside, Staff.
Sgt. Major, Roberts
is going into hospital.
- Keep him here, Sir, in a cell.
Be better if you attend him here, Sir.
-Sgt. major...
In twenty five years I've
never known a balls up like it!
From now on I'm taking on every
man, every prisoner, every Staff.
Staff Harris!
- Sir!
Report on you brother Officer, would you?
Try and undermine my authority, eh?
A useless article like you!
Harris, you're under close arrest!
- Oh, don't push me too hard...
I'm pushing you!
- ...you're going to need all the help you can get.
Now, before you're confined to
your quarters, do something useful.
Get a cell ready for Roberts.
- No.
Help Roberts with his kit,
he's going to hospital.
- I'm in charge of discipline here, Sir!
- Then you look after your
department and I'll look after mine.
- Don't try and cancel out my orders!
- I have the final word where the
men's health is concerned.
- Perhaps I was hasty.
I've had a day of it.
- So has Roberts.
He's going into hospital.
It's a pity you didn't put Roberts
and Stevens on light duty, Sir.
- What?
I thought Stevens looked delicate
but that wasn't my worry, was it?
What are you driving at?
Were they fit?  And Staff,
was Stevens, was he fit?
If I understand you right, by God
you're going to be in serious trouble!
Did you give him a medical?
- He did not!  I was there, wasn't I!
Passed him A-1 fit for punishment.
I punished him alongside Roberts,
King, Bartlett and MacGrath.
Well he's dead!
- Heat exhaustion, sunstroke and...
Stevens was a sick man and I only caught
on when it was too late, I'll swear to it.
Your neglect lumbered me with a dead man.
Now, you put Roberts into hospital
and give me the chance to break you.
Sgt. Major...
- Don't let them get away with it.
Sgt. Major, he's trying blackmail,
you heard him!
I'm putting Roberts in a cell.
Look, I gave on order.
Get Roberts into hospital, Sir, a courts
martial would break you, Sir, not Williams.
Shut your trap, Harris!
- The Commandants got the check on this lot now,
I won't be slow in telling him, it's me
that's gonna bust you Bert, I'm sorry.
I'll double Harris to his quarters, Sir.
- That's not the sort of doubling you're gonna do.
Get Roberts out.
-Me!  I'm running this place!
You ain't running this place Bert,
Williams is! Look at him!
He took over days ago,
you still haven't caught on!
I'm reporting everything that's
happened here.  It's you I'm after
but I won't worry too much
if you go down with him.
I'm phoning for an ambulance,
Roberts is going to hospital.
And then I'm going to
see the area Commander.
Try and blackmail me, would you,
Williams?  Well try it!  Go on, try it!
Have you anything else to say?
Yes, Sir, you won't do any
better than Stevens on that hill.
What the hell are you doing here?
Get back!  Do you hear me?
I'm giving you an order!
Get away from that door!
Move along, lads.
Thankyou very much, Sir.
- Thankyou, Sir.
Right, Bartlett, I'm putting you
in another cell, follow me.
I knew I could trust you, Staff!
It was getting very dicey in there,
you know, Staff.
Roberts, get your kit.
I'm moving you into a lonely cell.
Oh, why don't you catch on?
Your days of turning men
into toy soldiers are over.
I run this place, me!
I say what goes and what don't go!
Williams, I told you when you
came in I'd stand by my Staff.
- We gotta do some quick thinking.
- If you want to get me into another
bloody mess like this again,
I'm putting you on the gate.
- Listen, harris and the MO are going on report.
- You're a bit too hot even for me!
You don't seem to
understand, we stand together!
You work alongside me and I'll show you how
it's done.  You don't belt them in this game,
you break them, gently break them, and then
you built them up again into men, into soldiers!
- Listen, we throw it all onto Harris and the MO.
- You listening to me?
People listen to me when I'm talking.
- Look you would you shut up a minute...
- Shut up for God's sake!
You pay attention, I got enough
on my plate without you...
- You trying to give me orders?
No one does that!
I run this place, me!
I say what goes and what don't go.
Even if you go to the Commandant!
Think he'll listen?
He's saying yes to me before
I've even walked through the door!
Now, get this place cleaned up!
It's a pig sty!
Carry on, Staff.
In twenty five years I've
never known anything like it!
Never!  Not in twenty
five years!  Ever!
You're on your own now, Williams.
Oh you're still with me, Roberts.
Just you and me this time.
Don't touch him!
No you'll muck it up, don't touch him!
You'll muck it up!
Don't touch him!
We've won!  We've won!
You'll fuck it up!
