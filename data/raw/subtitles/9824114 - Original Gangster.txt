He's just a kid.
Let him go.
Please.
No.
From that very moment,
I realized there are two things that
exist in the heart of every man,
good and evil.
Kid?
Are you all right, kid?
Good.
It's good.
I have some sweets.
I get it.
You've got questions, right?
About your parents.
Your parents are both dead.
Your dad was too stubborn for
his own good.
If that was me and that was my
family, I'd be singing like a canary.
Well, that's just me, I suppose.
Do you understand what I'm
saying or are you just a retard?
I saved your fucking life.
Just answer me.
Here, have some.
Just take that.
You pay me back when you grow
up.
I want you to remember this day,
always.
The day I saved your life.
It'll help me sleep better.
You do understand what I'm
saying, don't you?
Yes, I am.
Good luck.
With my parents dead, the easiest thing
to do is crawl into the fetal position
and let the world consume it
away as done to so many before.
How could I live without
my mother's unconditional love
and my father's warm expectations
guiding my every step through life?
At first, I relied on the leftovers
of the strangers to survive,
but it's impossible to lift your head
up when it's buried deep in the dustbin.
Hello.
I'm.
I'm a friend.
Where is your mommy and daddy?
You're on your own?
You're a very handsome young
man.
Has anyone ever told you that
before?
Don't be scared.
We're going to play a game.
My only option was to fight
back.
My parents were dead
and not being for the kindness
of that man in my life, I would
be too.
With the help of the bow,
I slowly stopped being afraid.
A drink had a way of helping me
forget if not forgive the world,
for taking my family.
I began to contemplate heaven
and hell
and wondered if my mother
was looking down at me with joy
while my father looked up with
pride.
I didn't go to school.
I never had a job and as far
as the system was concerned,
I was missing, presumed
dead along with my parents.
I would live day by day,
hand-to-mouth.
The parks and woods of London,
my home.
The streets, my hunting ground.
I belong to the streets now
through sickness and in health.
My streets for a money-hungry
whore who demanded pay
before providing me with sweet
pussy.
Some nights, I would walk through the
city tortured by the sounds of drunken joy
while visualizing killing them all the
way my parents were so brutally murdered.
- this city's fights.
- It was a big shocker.
I tell you it fucking matters,
mate.
You be on your best behavior
tonight, Castor.
You see that fellow over there?
That's Patrick McKinley.
He's connected.
Connected to what?
It means he's a real bad man.
You want to see the the
girlfriend.
- I'll tell you what...
- You're Patrick McKinley, are you?
Yes, what mate.
How I can help you?
You're the bad man that comes in
my local making all this noise.
Now, you listen to me,
I don't like trouble but if
you are looking for trouble...
Sometimes in the wild, predators kill for
fun in a behavior called surplus killing.
They do this to sharpen their
predatory instincts in preparation
for the inevitable hard times
that lay ahead.
Give me your fucking money.
What the fuck are you doing man?
I know you.
You're that tramp that was
sleeping on the park and my yard.
Are crazy?
Next minute you're here.
Not that I give a fuck, huh.
Is that what you're saying, huh?
Give me one reason why I shouldn't blow your
fuckin' head off you dirty stinking tramp.
- Fuck it. Do it.
- Yes?
We'll put you out your misery,
yes?
He was right.
I had seen him before.
Even wild forced me to remember
most faces.
Trying to scare the shit out of
me.
But I'm not doing nothin' in
front of him, yes?
But I told you let's go back to my inn.
It's fuckin' dirty out here anyway.
I told you, I'm not coming back to
your house with that fucking dog there.
It's cool.
We leave him outside,
we latch him out there.
It's not.
That's what I'm talking about,
you get me?
Not such a big man now, are we?
You was right about one thing
though,
I ain't a killer.
I'm a businessman, entrepreneur.
Some people just like
the other side of the game.
So you're the motherfucker that
thinks he can steal my money.
Milo, is that you?
Who the fuck's Milo?
He's the exterminator,
motherfuckin' ex-commando
SAS bad man up in here.
You get what I'm sayin'?
Don't think you could talk your
way out of this pussy hole.
Now, Mr. Exterminator, pop this
waste man.
How do you know the name, Milo?
No one's called me Milo for the
past 10 years.
It's really you, Milo.
It's me, Castor.
You saved my life.
So you made it.
Good on you.
There he was, the man that saved my
life, the man I owed everything to.
What was up with this shit,
man?
Castor and me are old friends,
so how much did he take?
A lot.
Yes, how much?
Three grand. I got it here.
So you've got the money.
Yes, of course, I've got the money
but he still deserves to die.
Try to rob me in front of all my
cats
and you know what Mr. Philippe
would say about that,
make an example on that.
Philippe, and you leave him to
me.
Castor, if you come home with me,
yes, then we'll get you some food.
The wife's a good cook.
Well, that's how it is now, yes?
After all these years I've known
you, you've never invited me
to have a cup of tea with the wife,
and then you invite some tramp run.
You really are fuck me sometimes Mr. Exterminator,
or should I call you Milo from now on?
Shut the fuck up, yes?
You saved my life, Milo.
You did.
What are you going to do?
You were a kid, and now you're a
man, a homeless man.
You know, I owe everything to
you, Milo.
No, you stop with the queer
shit.
It's true.
This is my wife, Maria.
Beautiful, isn't she?
Yes.
How did you two meet?
I told you, Maria, don't ask
questions.
Your husband saved my life.
I owe everything to him.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Oh, you make me sick with your,
"Oh, that's so sweet."
You don't encourage him.
I didn't mean to, Milo.
Yes, and you need to stop that
fuckin' shit.
What do you mean, Milo?
You need to stop with all the
emotional talk every two minutes,
or to think we're a bunch of
puss.
I'm sorry, Milo.
No, no. Don't apologize.
Here, have some snacks.
Relax.
If I'd have known you were such
an emotional man,
I wouldn't have invited you into
my home.
What are you doing?
Are you hungry, Castor?
Can't fill up on snacks and crisps.
Let me offer you something else to eat.
No, he doesn't want to eat.
He's full up on the nuts, look at him.
Castor?
Milo's right. I'm all right.
Oh, yes, you hear that? He's all
right.
Yes, so fuck off, okay?
You leave the room when the men
are talking.
It's nice to meet you, Castor.
Bye.
You stop this shit.
- What shit?
- The pussy shit.
Sorry, Milo.
Are you happy with this life
that you owe to me?
No.
Yes, of course.
You see, you're part
of the generation of victims.
The bigger the victim, the
bigger the reward.
You probably think men and women
should use the same toilet,
yes, to protect the transgender
rights.
Oh, that's bollocks.
Do you believe in fate, Milo?
Look, just stop.
What are the chances
that after all these years,
you would be sent to murder me?
Destiny has brought us together,
don't you see?
I've got things to do.
You got somewhere to stay
tonight?
Yes.
Could I see you again?
Look, look, woah, woah, woah,
I'm not some piece of ass
that you've just had a one-nighter with. You
got to stop this clingy girlfriend shit.
Now, come on get out because I'm
late.
Castor?
Yes?
I was an orphan.
Did you know that?
No, Milo.
No, no, why would you?
You see, I started from nothing.
I just had a strong work ethic
and drive.
Every penny that I earned, I
saved.
And you know what I did with the
savings?
- No Milo.
- I invested.
Do you know what I invested in?
Myself.
Now, you think about that.
Well, fuck off.
Seeing Milo after all these years had
to have been more than a coincidence.
Buffet wasn't going to provide
me with a room for the night
and a cold night like tonight,
I would have to run particularly
after some satisfying prey.
Money now. Now.
Empty the fucking till.
Fuck off, cock sucking cunt.
I know I have been around the
scent of death my entire life.
This was the first life I've
been sure I have taken and yet,
as I look down at his dead
corpse, his soul leaving his body,
I found no remorse or
compassion.
Just a pull towards the man
I owed my whole life to.
Milo.
Hello again.
Is Milo home?
No, he's at work.
You can come in if you like.
He won't be long.
Do you live locally?
Yes, not far.
Are you married?
No.
Girlfriend?
No.
Is he going to be long?
Speak of the devil,.
- What are you up to?
- Don't be so rude.
What? What was that?
Nothing.
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
I'm sorry, Milo.
Listen, when men are talking,
women don't get involved.
How many times do I have to tell
you that?
What can I do for you, kid?
Listen, sorry, it's so early.
Come on. You spit it out.
Yes, right.
I've been thinking about what you
said about investing in myself.
How much are you thinking of
investing?
I've got about a grand.
Well, that won't even buy you
an ounce in this market.
You'd be better off shooting in
your vein.
I'd be more satisfying, trust
me.
So is heroin. Your business.
Asking question like that.
- No, Milo. I'm just asking.
- Yes, why don't we ask it especially like that.
Are you wearing a wire?
What do you want from me?
I want a chance.
What kind of a chance?
To be like you, Milo.
You give me a fucking headache.
What do you want, a consignment?
What does that mean?
I float you a kilo for a week at
30.
The retail price is 40,
sometimes more.
You'll double your money, easy.
See, heroin can be whatever you
like.
It could be your best friend
or your worst enemy.
The magnitude of my task began
to sink in.
I didn't want to let Milo down.
I owe everything to that man and I
wouldn't want to burden him with my demise.
Excuse me.
This is a place of the rest for
the dead.
Please take your private party
somewhere else, please.
Sorry, darling. I'll be gone in
a minute.
Did you just call me darling?
Did you just call me fucking
darling?
Do you know nothing about the MeToo
movement, you misogynistic pig?
No, I don't.
What a man-thing to say?
I am not your darling,
and I don't need you
mansplaining everything to me,
you disgusting white privileged
man.
We no longer live in your world.
Your time is up.
Fuck off.
30,000, one week, Friday,
whatever you don't sell, you
return.
Milo said, don't fuck up.
Drug dealing didn't come
with an instruction manual,
and even if it did, I can hardly
read.
I had no scales, no sealer bags,
and no idea what to do.
I had to think out of the box.
Since Milo had so kindly given
me a reduced rate of 30,000,
I just had to find a real drug
dealer who would give me 40,
and if there was one thing
London wasn't short of,
that was drug dealers.
Who's in charge?
Good morning, handsome?
Always good to see a new face.
So what can I get you?
Do you want some snacks, crack,
some crank?
I'm not buying, I'm selling.
What are you selling?
I got a kilogram.
I know it goes for 40 a gram
but I'll give it to you for 38.
Wow.
You're taking a piss?
Oh, no. Am I taking a piss? Am
I?
Am I taking a piss, Johnny?
It's just-
it's not everyday that someone comes
to my home and tries to sell me a kilo.
Are you interested or not?
Can I make a really large
presumption about you?
Can I?
I'm going to make a presumption
that you're new to this game.
Is that right, handsome?
Maybe.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
We were all new to this game
once upon a time.
You see, Baby K, I love you.
You see, I remember when I
made my first pasta sauce.
I cut up the onions, threw them
in the pan,
then the tomatoes and the basil.
I fried it all up and that smell was
just, oh, it was just driving me wild.
I'd never experienced that smell before.
It was just infiltrating me.
It was just going deep,
deep down into my soul.
I couldn't wait to taste that
fucking sauce.
I got wooden spoon and I dipped
it in and I took a taste.
Just like that.
And guess what?
That sauce tasted like shit.
No sweetness.
You see, without the sugar, the
sauce is acidic.
But I-I want to help you.
Is that it on your arm?
Maybe.
I'd like to sample it?
What do you mean?
How do I know if it's any good
if I can't sample it?
Thank you.
Baby K,
you hope to put it in this.
Oh.
You know, a lesser mind would've
thought that you were just a cop.
Fuck you.
Oh, I don't think you're a cop.
You see, my spider senses would've alerted
me if you were one of the boys in blue.
But my spider senses right now
are just-
they're telling me something
else.
What's that?
How many times have I told you
to get your fucking haircut, huh?
How many fucking times have I told
you to get the fucking haircut?
What do you think this is?
1980 fucking 6?
You little shit.
Look how handsome he is.
Look at his fucking hair.
You little fuckin'.
I hate the way you fuckin' look
at me.
It makes me fuckin' crazy.
But I'm so attracted to you as well.
I'm fucking so attracted to you.
Oh, God, I'm so fuckin'.
You want to sell me this shit?
This is what you want to do?
I don't know what to do with
you, man.
It's like I want to fall into
your eyes and pop out of your ass.
That's what you make me feel.
It's time you left
and you can leave the kilo here.
Mr. Handsome, I'd like to
thank you for your generosity.
Now, I would like you to fuck
off.
If you come back around here
again, you won't be leaving.
Castor.
Oh my God, you're hurt.
Come inside.
What the fuck is this?
- He's hurt, Milo.
- I need a gun.
Where the fuck's my product?
It's gone for now, but I promise
you, Milo, I'll give it back.
What the fuck do you mean it's
gone?
Gone? Gone where?
Where is my fucking product?
They took it, Milo.
Just leave it, Milo.
There you go.
I like you, Castor, yes.
I always have, yes.
- Sorry, Milo.
- You see, you're loyal like your father
and I see it in you.
Now, we're both just going to
keep calm.
Who took my dough?
Drug dealers, Milo.
Right, so you know where they
are?
Who they are? You know where to
find them?
Yes, I'll handle it. I'll handle it.
Just give me an hour.
Give me an hour. I promise you.
Yes, one hour.
I'm sorry, I let you down, Milo.
I'm sorry, but I'll get it back.
Don't worry, I promise you.
I just need a gun.
Yes, you take this one.
That's a subcompact glock 43,
single stack pistol.
It carries six and one in the
chamber, yeah.
That should be plenty.
It'll probably scare them as soon
as they see it. Most people do.
Six.
Yes, yes, yes six.
Seven. You fucking deaf
as well as fucking stupid.
Is Maria okay? Is Maria okay?
Don't you fucking worry about
Maria, she's had worse.
Hey, you all right, darling?
You want boom boom?
You'll feel better, baby.
Have you got a vest?
Why?
Fucking, fucking amateurs.
Fucking amateur.
If I wasn't such a sensitive little
man, I would've fucking killed you.
my fucking gun.
I don't care, it doesn't matter.
Fuck.
Sorry, Milo. I'm sorry, I'm
sorry.
What do I do with that?
You wear it under these clothes
here.
You wear it every time you leave
this house on business.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Milo.
Yes, but what does it do?
It's a fucking bulletproof vest.
It could be the difference
between you living and dying.
Now, let's go. Chop, chop.
Now, you've fucking upset my
wife.
I always felt during times
of extreme adrenaline,
a good stiff drink would calm my
nerves.
I was outmanned and outgunned,
but I couldn't let Milo down.
I owed him everything.
Seven bullets, enough to leave
my mark.
One.
- Two.
- Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Right. That's most of it, but I
found a load of his own plus cash
and I was thinking, it'd only be fair if
you had on the count of me fucking up.
Milo.
Maria.
Maria.
Baby?
Can I get you anything?
No. You come here.
Come here and you sit with me
and Castor.
Come on.
Come.
I'm sorry, baby.
It was Castor's fault.
Is that right?
Yes, it's my fault.
See what he did to that
beautiful eye.
Now, you'll apologize to my
wife.
I'm sorry, Maria.
It's okay, Castor.
Did you hear that?
Lovely.
Yes.
That's it.
Now, you fuck off and get us
some.
Yes, Milo.
Are you a psychopath?
What, Milo?
It doesn't matter if you are.
I just need to know what I'm
dealing with.
What do you mean?
When you killed all those
people,
did you do it for pleasure or was
it necessary in retrieving my dope?
You told me to get the dope and I
thought that was the easiest way.
Are you mad at me?
No, so you are just stupid because you
have created so much brew heat out there
that I genuinely don't know what
to do with you.
Now, my initial reaction was
to cut off your fucking head.
Then I shove it up your fucking
ass.
Then of the fucking
I'll feed you to the fucking
lions.
If that's what you think's best,
Milo.
Fortunately for you,
a very important person sees a potential
use in your fuck who knows why.
But he who pays the piper calls
the tune
They want to see me.
Oh, your constant talking
drives me fucking crazy.
Milo, I'm not good at thinking,
but if he wants to see me,
and you think it's best, then
yes.
Jean-Baptiste Philippe has
called for you.
Have you heard of Jean-Baptiste
Philippe?
- Is he an actor?
- He's a fucking...
Yes, yes, yes. He can be.
If the situation calls for it,
yes.
Jean-Baptiste Philippe, he came
from nothing.
Lower than the dirt under your
feet.
Just like you. Just like you,
Castor.
Now, he's one of the most
prestigious men in the city
and one of the most important
criminals.
So he's got money, the
Frenchman.
Jean-Baptiste's got more than
money, son.
He's got class.
Class?
He's not French.
Rise up the manna
Flow heavy
Vibes dirty
More love
More respect
Straight out of London
Rise up the manna
Straight out of London
Hello, I am Jean-Baptiste
Philippe.
Powerful men have powerful
enemies,
and Jean-Baptiste was one of the
most powerful men in the city,
a one-time kappa
from the Gambino crime family.
Jean-Baptiste Philippe fled New York during
the FBI's war on the mob in the late '80s.
By the late '90s, he controlled
nearly all the smack in London,
after masterminding and executing the
assassination of , head of the Kurdish mafia.
It was Jean-Baptiste policy to cut off
the head of the beast and do business
with whatever's left.
If you didn't want to do
business with Jean-Baptiste,
you became the beast.
Why are you looking at me?
They know who I am.
Little fucking turtles.
Castor, you had a brief but eventful
experience as a drug dealer.
Am I right?
Yes.
Perhaps your skills would be
best utilized in another area.
Yes?
Hey, don't look so nervous.
Calm down. Relax. Relax, right?
Relax. Oom, Oom.
I ain't nervous.
see, your predicament has caused me
to ponder what exactly to do with you.
What am I supposed to do with
you?
You mean you're a wanted man.
There is virtually a police manhunt right
now as we speak for your little ass.
I've got plenty of space here in
the compound.
I can easily find space for a
man with potential like you,
away from the beady little eyes of
the boys in blue, out of the cold,
especially with winter
approaching.
You could live here,
but then why should I harbor a
murderer?
You tell me. Fucking look at him, fucking.
Look at him. Look at him.
He doesn't know.
Why should I fucking harbor a murder?
That would make me an accessory
after the fact.
I barely know the young man.
I barely know him. I don't know
you.
Whatever you think is right,
Milo.
It's not the time for talking,
Castor.
Mr. Philippe is here to help
you.
So shut the fuck up.
You do something for me
and then I do something for you.
Become part of my family, right?
Become like blood.
Now, you do something for me.
Open it.
There's a problem.
What's the problem?
I don't read too good, Milo.
I know some words but this is a
lot.
What?
I'm choking.
No.
Are you kidding me?
Really?
Whoa.
Castor, this is Damien Tarv.
He's a former soldier,
served this country proudly
until he was dishonorably discharged
for drink and drugs and other shit
that I'm not going to talk about
because I respect you,
but maybe you're wondering why I
tolerate this disobedient jester.
Well, okay if I tell the story?
Okay.
It's a nice story.
I was introduced to him by his
mother, Martha Tarver.
I used to fuck Damien's mother
in the asshole,
and she used to beg from her bed with the
asshole still widened by my elegant penis.
She would say, "Oh, please,
Jean-Baptiste, give my boy a job."
So I had a pity for this boring
woman,
I helped her cretin of a son.
I moved him into my compound.
I bought him some fancy new
suits.
I gave him a competitive salary.
You know the expression, Castor,
son of a whore is a son of a whore?
Lots of people can't read.
My mother couldn't read.
Fucking mother was a saint, man.
She was a fucking saint.
Huh. I'm okay now.
Amarildo Alban was a rival
heroin dealer
who operated out of a small
coffee shop in Tottenham.
Hello, this is Amarildo. Can I
help you?
Amarildo Alban refused to negotiate
with Jean-Baptiste Philippe.
He wanted what he had all to
himself.
It was a tiny little operation.
They'd empty high rows of bread
and stuff the crust with the dope.
The police were always one step
behind Amarildo,
and even when one or two caught
on to the scam,
Amarildo will make the problem
disappear.
You get the fuck inside.
Open the fucking till.
Yes?
Open the fucking till.
Open the fucking till.
We didn't come here to play.
We didn't fucking come here to...
open it up.
Fuck. Who the fuck?
Now, his two sons, Agron and Alban, may
not have been as tough as their old man,
but Amarildo was quick to teach
them that the louder the roar,
the weaker the bite.
The Albanians' bakery soon were
more profitable little fuck you
to a major rival
of Jean-Baptiste dope monopoly.
If I wanted to please Milo,
the man I owe everything to,
I had to slay this particular
beast myself.
Yes, please.
Yes, please.
Amarildo?
Please. I'm sorry, please.
Just, please. No.
Thanks to Milo, Jean-Baptiste
Philippe honored his agreement
and set me up in a small
quarter cabin in his compound.
No. I fucking told you,
enough with the queer shit.
A far cry from the cold,
wet box I had grown used to.
I kept myself to myself.
I barely spoke to
Jean-Baptiste's soldiers.
I could finally mourn my parents' death
and await further instructions from Milo.
Another brown envelope soon
followed.
I wasn't sure if they were coming
from Milo or Jean-Baptiste or both.
What I did know is I had finally
found a purpose.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
That's good. That's good.
I'm going to cum.
Either way,
I think Milo was happy with me.
After a while, it became at
least once a month.
For the independent dealers,
mainly ambitious creatures,
as a foreigner who knew no better,
if I could get in on the action.
Cool pictures on account of me
not being able to read.
I figured as it was such a kind
gesture,
it must have been Milo's idea.
I was too wild for the civilized
wave
in the poorest, most vulnerable
Londoners have been raised.
My victims were merely antelope
encountering a lion for the first time.
A gift from Jean-Baptiste
Philippe.
You see him, huh?
What are you looking at?
Hey, I was joking, man.
He's joking. Sit down.
Merry Christmas, Milo.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's with the presents?
Why are you dressed like you're
getting married?
Well, it's Christmas.
I've brought gifts for you and Maria.
What for?
It's Christmas.
- That's what families do, right?
- Yes, but we're not family.
Besides, I haven't got you
anything.
That doesn't matter, Milo.
You've done more than enough for me.
Look, why are you still standing there?
Come inside. We're going to eat.
Oh, Castor, I love it.
Milo never buys me anything for
Christmas.
Is it real wool?
I don't know.
Milo, open your present.
I'm drinking red wine for Jesus
on Christmas.
Don't be so rude.
Your guest has been kind enough
to bring you a present.
The least you could do is open
it.
What's that then?
All that.
What do you think he's fucking
eating?
Hey, look, is that not a gift?
Is that not a gift?
Never get married, Castor.
Do you hear me?
It's a shortcut to a miserable
life.
Maria seems nice.
Maria is a good woman.
No, I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about you.
Don't get married is what I'm
saying.
You're still fucking stupid
after all these years.
Why not?
What?
Why can't I get married?
Are you seeing someone?
Well, no.
Just eat you food now.
Jean-Baptiste says you're doing
good.
Maybe you found your niche.
Yes, it's good.
The compound, you like it?
It will be better than living on
the streets.
Yes.
Do you know how we came by that
compound?
He won it in a game of cards
of an old grass gangster
that was hiding from the Russian
mob.
He lost it to a full house of trips on
a Monday and he was dead by Tuesday.
Never be a grass.
Not good.
Never, Milo.
Yes. I know.
That's why I like you.
You're an original gangster.
Yes, don't panic. It's done.
Just take your food.
She is probably having her
period.
Maria killed the man I loved.
Listen, I saved your fucking
life.
A man that saved my life and
given me purpose.
But didn't understand why
didn't kill her there and then.
Police came to see me today.
They know about Milo.
I'm sincerely sorry for your
loss.
Thanks.
You okay?
It's okay.
What did you do with Maria?
She did murder the man who saved
your life.
Milo told you.
I know all about your tale of
love.
Were you there when it happened?
Yes.
Nobody could see it coming,
especially not Maria.
I'm well aware of my Milo's ill
nature toward her.
I don't condone that kind of
thing personally.
What a man does in the privacy
of his own home
with his wife is no concern
of mine or anybody else's.
Milo was a dear friend of mine.
He was a major financial asset
to my corporation,
a dear, dear friend of yours
who loved you like a son.
You know that, right?
Like you do with all close
family.
You forgive their flaws
and you learn to live with them.
Maria learned to live with those flaws.
She was his wife.
Milo, someone who I respected
dearly.
You too.
Man I loved, a man that saved
your life.
Yes, sir.
What a man we've lost?
What a tragedy, don't you think?
Where is she?
Maria was released on bail this
afternoon.
I don't expect her to see this
weekend.
Do you?
No.
Excellent.
I don't think you will need a brown
envelope for this one, do you?
Do it quickly.
No suffering.
We are not animal.
Chin up.
Chin up, Castor.
It's okay to cry.
It's okay to cry.
I wish Milo was there to tell me
what to do.
Maybe Milo wouldn't want me
killing his wife,
but Milo was dead,
and Jean-Baptiste called the shots.
He said this was for the best,
so it was the right thing to do.
You move, I'll kill you.
No, it's all right. This is
Castor.
No, it's not all right, babe.
It's not all right.
You, inside.
Oh, boy.
You, get down where I can see
you.
It's all right.
Look, if Castor wanted to kill me, he
would have done it when he had the chance
on Christmas morning.
Maria, so trusting.
Just like your mother, God rest
her soul.
Tell me why I piss on him?
It was all for this.
I should hear this.
He was making sure the coast
was clear before he killed you.
Isn't that right,
you cocksucking son of a whore?
What are you going to do?
Don't do this?
Castor won't harm a fly.
He even bought me this Christmas
present, this wonderful wool jumper.
It was my Milo that ruined it
there.
What I'm going to do about it?
This is what I'm going to do
about it.
I thought that was the end,
killed by an innocent father
who was only trying to protect his
daughter from a scumbag like me.
Then he hesitated.
Now, I think everyone just needs
to calm down.
Please.
Castor.
Good.
See. I told you.
Castor is really nice.
Mario Leone was born on the
island of Crete
and immigrated to London
as a young child in the '60s.
The son of peasants,
Mario pulled himself out of the pit of poverty
with a passion and panache of a hawker.
Yes,
After losing his wife to a sudden and
unexpected stroke when Maria was just two,
Mario developed the most
bitter hate in his heart.
Suddenly, this little gambler
had awoken his inner beast.
If you want to fly...
Superman.
For the right price, killing for
Mario became as easy as it was for me.
If I see you again, I'll kill
you, bastard.
Castor, you forgot your gun.
Thanks.
Are you going to come back?
I don't know.
Can I ask you something?
Yes.
Why didn't you kill me on Christmas
morning when you had the chance?
Would you still let me do it
myself?
Maria, inside.
Now.
Like I said, you seem nice.
I should probably go.
See you soon then?
Maybe.
Aren't you one of my guys?
I think so.
Why is Maria still alive then?
I don't think Milo would have wanted that.
She was his wife.
No, no, no.
Just listen to me, okay?
Milo would have wanted you
to avenge his death.
Okay?
- Really?
- Really. Yes, really. 100%.
Jesus Christ.
Just look, don't be fucking with this
blossoming relationship we got, okay?
Just avenge his death. If you need
a fucking reason, do it for Milo.
Mr. Philippe,.
Why don't you just ask me to do it?
I'll do it tonight, no problem,
and Castor if you want.
Castor? What the fuck is wrong
with you?
He's a good kid. Okay?
Don't fuck with him. Christ.
I see something special in that
kid.
Do you see something special in
me?
No.
Jean-Baptiste was right.
Why ruin the life I created for myself
for a woman who killed the man I loved,
the man who saved my life.
Milo was dead.
I needed as many friends as I
could get.
Jean-Baptiste Philippe was good to
me, one of the few that ever was.
Yes, it was the right move.
I had to murder Maria.
How was your day?
I was expecting you.
It's what Milo would have
wanted.
I know.
Don't be sad, never.
You have no choice.
It's you or me, right?
It is the right thing.
What happens now?
Jean-Baptiste Philippe will
probably kill us both.
Why don't we kill him first?
What makes him so special?
It's not as simple as that.
tell me.
if you apologize.
I'm just trying to help.
You can talk to me anytime.
Milo never liked it when I
tried to suggest anything.
Milo.
Don't be sad.
Milo is dead now.
You've got to do whatever it
takes to survive.
Do you hear me?
What's going on here?
Castor is just trying to help.
Is that what you call it, Maria?
You disappoint me.
Do you hear me?
Look, some very bad people are going
to come after your daughter very soon.
Well, you tell me who now and
I'll kill them all.
- No offense but...
- But what?
Jean-Baptiste is one of the
most powerful men in this city.
A Frenchman.
- A Frenchman?
- No, he's not French.
I think it's a fake name but he's
got a very well-fed army behind him
and wouldn't stand a chance.
A Frenchman?
No.
Do you know how long it took the
Nazis to conquer the whole of France?
Six weeks.
60 million people conquered in
six weeks.
Do you know how long it took the Nazis
to conquer the tiny island of Crete
with a population of 200,000?
Have a guess.
I don't really care because he's
not French.
Now is not the time for a
history lesson, dad.
As Winston Churchill so
eloquently put it,
"Hence, we will not say that Greeks fight like
heroes but the heroes fight like Greeks."
I needed a drink to clear my mind and settle
all that adrenaline pumping through my veins.
A Frenchman.
As for the Nazis,
they never did fully conquered Crete.
What's happening, kid? Are you
married yet?
No.
No? Got yourself a girlfriend?
I think so.
Yes, well, what's her name.
Maria, but I don't think she'll
be my girl for long.
Why not?
It's complicated.
I never fancy getting married
myself.
Came close once.
Chick by the name of Geraldine.
Do you want to know
why I never married Geraldine?
Because she had a deformed big
toe.
I mean, this thing was
disgusting.
Big, grand, red thing.
The other foot was all right. Yes, pretty
sexy if you're into that type of thing.
Oh, my God, that big toe.
A toe?
Not a toe.
The toe.
The thing did not have a normal
toenail.
No, it had a claw on the end of
it.
Yes, a sharp, pointy thing.
This thing would ooze pass
on the impact of every step.
The kid was born with it.
I mean it's not like today.
Back then, if you were born with an
abnormality, you are stuck with it.
She was really beautiful, that
Geraldine, aside from that monster toe.
Most days, she would cover the thing
up by wearing a pair of fancy shoes.
Closed-toe, obviously
but on one hot summer's day,
we decided to go to the beach with
my brother Willy and his wife,
Wendy, make the most of the
weather.
Me and Geraldine were really in
love.
She felt very comfortable
in my company, of course.
The poor kid, she's decided
to wear a pair of flip-flops.
Let the thing breathe a bit.
Now, I personally had stopped
caring about it.
I became used to it.
I mean, I never used to directly
stare at it or anything.
I just ignored it, but when Willy and his wife,
Wendy, saw that deformed toe in flip flops,
they laughed their fucking heads
off.
Now you see that Geraldine,
she's a very fiery girl from Edmonson
and she took no shit from anyone.
She's like, turned red and she just punched
Willy's wife right on the end of her nose.
Bam. Busted it open.
Willy's gone ballistic.
Though he would never hit a woman but
he came very close that summer's day.
Now, Willy, he's my older brother and he
tended to be right about most of things.
He just said, "Listen, you'd better cut it off
with that Geraldine on the account of punching
Wendy and dishonoring me in the
process."
Willy refused to talk to me
until I broke it off with her.
This is my older brother you're
talking about here, Castor.
We've been through so much shit
together.
I mean I just had so after a
while, I just thought to myself,
"Fuck it. Plenty of fish in the sea.
I'll do what Willy says,"
so I dumped her.
Broke the poor kid's heart and
mine.
A couple of months later,
Geraldine still heartbroken,
leaves London and goes for Sussex
where she met and later married
Brits.
Then they had three children
and their children had children.
Their feet were fine in case you
are wondering.
As for me, I lost most of my
hair that winter,
gained more than just a little bit of
puppy fat and ended up buying this place,
which has taken up
most of my time since then.
Look, listen, Castor. I'll tell you
what I'm trying to say to you is this.
You do what's best for you.
Fuck everyone else
and whatever they might think.
No matter how close they are to
you.
Hey, Lenny, that's a pint glass
for drinking beer out of.
The fucking toilets are over
there. Come on.
Have you decided what you're
going to do now?
Yes, I think so.
Do you want to come inside?
If you're going to help, that
is.
I completely understand
if you don't want to help.
If you want to kill me,
save you little fuss then.
I don't want to kill you.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
I took a sip of adrenaline settler
and realized Maria was right.
Jean-Baptiste had to die if I
wanted her to live.
He was still unaware I'd
switched allegiance.
Upon that ending mass
peacefully,
I could kill Mario here
while he chases his faith,
return and kill Maria without
much fuss.
I'm sure she wouldn't mind
as long as I was happy.
Just sit down there and wait,
and be quiet.
We need all the help we can get,
divine or otherwise.
It just didn't feel right.
I'm going to kill the Frenchman.
Now, that will probably reunite
me with my wife,
which I'm happy to do.
My only concern is my daughter
and your future intentions.
Do you love Maria?
Yes, I think so.
You think so?
I don't know.
Well, will you take care of her?
Yes.
Forever?
I suppose.
Can you promise me in the house
of God?
Yes.
Now you listen to me, son,
my daughter means everything to me.
Now, if you want my blessing,
you better say it with some conviction.
Now, do you love my daughter?
Yes.
Good.
Now, I'm going to kill
this Jean-Baptiste Philippe.
If you make it out alive,
are you going to take care of my daughter?
Yes.
Through sickness and in health.
Yes.
All right.
Let's say a quick prayer before
we kill some folks.
Yes, wait for me.
Let me help you.
Drive her around the block
till we come back out.
Castor is right, Maria.
We may need to get away quickly.
Circle the compound and wait.
I love you Castor.
As I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for thou
walk with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they
comfort me.
They'll prepare a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.
They'll anoint my head with oil.
My cup run it over.
Surely goodness and mercy will follow
me for all the days of my life,
and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.
Bobby shot me.
Bobby, bastard, I can't believe
he shot me.
Oh, fuck.
I'm probably going to fucking
die now.
You hear me? Castor?
I'm very sorry about that.
Fuck your sorry.
You're going to fucking die next.
What's the point of killing me?
You're already dying.
At least one of us may as well
live.
Over my fucking dead body.
Well, you are dying.
Fair point.
Mom. Mommy, is that you?
Where is my dad?
What? Dead?
I'm sorry, Maria.
Jean-Baptiste Philippe.
Yes, he's dead too.
I moved into Milo's old house
to protect Maria from any revenge
attacks Jean-Phillipe's men
may have been planning.
I wondered what Milo would think
about me lying with his wife
and murdering his friend,
Jean-Baptiste Philippe.
I began to contemplate destiny again
and the chances of meeting Milo again
after all those years.
Maybe Milo saving my life was all part
of destiny's plan for me to meet Maria.
I wish he was here to ask.
He would nearly always know the
answer.
Remo temporarily to control of the compound and
Jean-Baptiste Philippe's heroin operation.
He was already conspiring with Damian to kill
Jean-Baptiste and take over his entire empire.
I saved him the trouble of doing
it himself
and having to explain himself to
Jean-Baptiste's well-paid crew.
For saving him the trouble,
he agreed to leave us both alone.
He already had enough on his
plate proving
he was man enough to be
at the top of such a big tree.
Maria was cleared
of Milo's murder as self-defense
leaving our path clear to a secluded
place without a care in the world.
Prison, pride.
Perfect.
Maria even helped me educate
myself.
Taught me to read and write properly,
cleaned me up, and stopped me drinking.
Maria got pregnant.
It was the greatest thing I
could ever imagine.
For the first time in my life,
I felt a sense of belonging,
a sense of family.
I felt like a real man
and less like a wild animal.
Every man has the right to chase
his dreams
and I had achieved mine.
I was living the dream,
and all I ever dreamt of was normality.
I told you, no one talks with
the
As I lay there in Maria's arms,
I first thought of my parents,
dead, in that cold warehouse,
I thought of Milo,
shot on the head on Christmas Day,
and I thought about my unborn
child growing up without a daddy,
but then, I thought of Maria
and how she love me,
cared for me, and needed me by
her side.
For a minute there, I thought I
was dead.
Looks like Milo saved my life
again.
