To town... or... where're you going?
Me and Amanda are goingto

Oh.
Well... ljust...
Don'tlet Mouse bother you.
He's really disturbed.
Why do you hangwlth him?
I don'tknow. We... we've hung out
ever since kindergarten.
We hadfun. I don'tknowwho
I'd hang outwlth, otherwise...
Everyone hates me.
What?
- That's whatitfeels like.
It's totallyinsane.
You want a drink? Lemonade...
ah... or... I mean cola?
No thanks.
I don'tknowwhy I said lemonade...
Maybe 'cause when I have
friends over, mom always asks...
"Do you want some lemonade?"
I meant cola...
Butyou don'twant any...?
Good... stay on the catwalk,
ifthis were real, you'dfall off.
No marching: light and supple.
Happyfaces...
Good, stop there.
Work your hips, remember that.
What's this?
Oh that...? That's nothing.
"Time to wake up, and hitback,
raise up your hand"
Is this a poem?
- No, lyrics to a song. Timbuktu.
Itlooks like a poem.
No! We hadthis assignmentto bring
a poem. I didn'tfind one.
So, ltookthose lyrics instead.
- Oh.
It's not a poem!
I can playthe song
for you ifyou want.
"Kids are feelingthat after
the politicians failed...
...allthat remains aretombstones or
cobblestones-
- againstthe constable's
duty weapon..."
The beginning is a little...
I don'tknow...
"Media Sweden backs fromthe leadto
entertainment rabble...
The whole bunch sits inthe same boat
withtheirfat necks.
The people are stuck inthe middle...
Cops shooting kids, andthen..."
- It's like... a good message...
"...me and Jason willdo it,
we'llsingthis song...
Life must have its way
in a state ofemergency.
Timeto wake up...
And hit back
Raise up your hand
Andtaketothe streets
as high as you can
andtake it back..."
Did ithurt?
- Huh?
No...
I mean yeah, butit doesn't
reallymatter, lwas so drunk.
Yeah, me too...
I hardlyremember anything.
Me neither.

Butwlth those panties on the head,

So lthinkthat Mikael, or
"Mouse"was justtryingto-
- flirtwlth you, because
he thinks you're pretty.
What? He grabs my pussy. And
I should be grateful, or what?
No... itwas clumsy ofhim to
touch your... private parts.
Buthe did itbecause
he thinks you're cute!
Maybe you couldtake
it as a compliment.
Yeah, like ifl grabbed your tits,
you'd be reallyhappy!
That's notwhat I meant...
- What did you mean then?
Are you happynow!?
- But Sofie...
Stop! What are you doing?
