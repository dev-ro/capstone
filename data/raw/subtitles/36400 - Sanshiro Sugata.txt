APOLOGY
This is an edited version of
Mr Kurosawa's first film.
The original film
was released in March 1943.
Some 1856 feet had been
cut from it by the censors
without the permission of the director or his staff.
Although these restrictions
have now been lifted
we are unable to restore
the film to its original form
as the edited parts were lost
during the post-war confusion.
But we have decided
to re-release this film
as we believe it has value
even in edited form.
We seek the understanding
of our patrons in this matter.

Will you please let me pass?
Not unless you have business at the shrine...
l have business. Let me pass.
Are you making a wish at the shrine?
No he is looking for the house
of the jujutsu instructor
Easy to go, hard to return.
That's the house
But he's not likely to be in.
He's in a show
at the theatre in Asakusa.
''Kassatsu School
Jujutsu lnstructor Monma''
You're one of us now. Let's drink.
You're a fortunate man, you know.
You're going to see a good show tonight.
We're going to attack Shogoro Yano.
What? Don't you know Yano of Shudokan Judo?
What's judo?
- Good heavens!
-Well...
Yano calls jujutsu judo.
He's plotting to make big money out of it.
Right.
The police have decided
they need a jujutsu instructor
and we stand a good
chance of getting the job.
We can't afford to let it
go to that young academic.
He must die.
Will you ambush him?
We'll contend.
Master!
- We found him. Please come.
- Where?
He's heading this way in a rickshaw.
Let's wait at the bridge.
Don't carry any weapons!
That would disgrace us.
You come too. You'll learn something.
Where are you going, Father?
- l'll be back soon.
- ls it dangerous?
Don't be silly
l'm Yano Shogoro of the Shudokan.
Are you after someone or is this an ambush?
Which is your school?
We're from the Kassatsu school.
State your name.
Kill me!
l won't kill you or break your arm.
- What's your name?
- Kill me!
What do you have against me?
lt isn't that. This is a punishment.
Punishment?
How stupid!
You'll only hasten the decline of jujutsu.
l've been humiliated by a youngster.
l can't live knowing that. Come on, kill me.
lf only you used your
spirit for the good of jujutsu.
lt's a pity.
Rickshaw man!
Where are you?
You're safe now!
Master! Let me take you home.
Please get in.
- Will you pull the rickshaw?
- Yes.
- All right.
- l haven't done anything!
- ldiot!
What did you say before, you bastard?
- Hey! Don't be so arrogant.
- What?
Master!
Master...
Sugata is back.
Call him.
Master!
Please don't be too hard on him.
Bring him here.
Master...
Well...
Did you feel good
after throwing someone?
l'm sorry.
l would have liked
to see how you fought.
You're strong. You've grown very strong.
By now you may have
surpassed me in strength.
However...
your judo
is vastly inferior in quality to my judo.
Do you know why?
You don't know the human truth.
To teach judo to someone
who doesn't know this
is as dangerous as giving a knife to a madman.
l know the human truth, sir!
Liar!
You have no reason or purpose in life!
ls mere violence the human truth?
The human truth...
is the truth of nature and the world.
Only through this truth can
one find peace in death.
lt is the ultimate point
to which all paths lead.
lt's the same with judo.
Sugata!
You can't see this essential point.
l can, Master.
lf you wish it, l shall die in peace now.
- Liar!
- Yes, l shall.
Shut up! When did you become such a rogue?
l don't believe a word a liar like you utters.
l shall die.
Die, then.
Master!
Sugata is still in the pond.
lt's late and he's endured.
Please forgive him.
Master, he is indeed both violent and stubborn
but this is a little too much.
He can come out whenever he likes.
But you haven't forgiven him.
He'll come out in time. That's the way.
Master!
Won't you forgive him?
ldiot!
He's not going to die.
He's thinking.
Hello, proud one.
ls it painful?
You don't answer.
You haven't seen the light yet.
Won't you give in, Sanshiro?
No!
lf you can shout that loud you won't die yet.
But, Sanshiro...
Do you know what it is you're
hanging on to right now?
You're too proud to see it.
- lt's a stake!- That's right.
lt's the stake of life.
Without that stake
you'd sink into the mud.
You're too proud to come out,
but would die without the stake.
Shut up, monk!
Come on, why don't you give in and get out.
No!
Stubborn man!
Very well.
ln that case...
enjoy the view of the moon all night.
Master!
Master!
ls Mr Yano in?
Master is out now.
Are any of his students in?
l'm one of them.
Any others?
Yes there's another.
l want a practice match.
May l ask who you are?
Gennosuke Higaki of the Ryoi Shinto School.
Come in.
Please.
Bring some water.
Who's next?
Mr Higaki...
Will you practise with me?
l'd like to practise with
Mr Yano's judo students.
Then you'll have to
come back another day.
What about him?
- l'm ready.
- No, you can't.
Mr Higaki...
l'm afraid this student
has been suspended.
Please leave.
That's a pity.
Mr linuma, l'm sure Master Yano
would permit it in this case.
But he's not here to give his permission.
- But sir!
- No!
- l'm ready.
- No!
What is your name?
Sanshiro Sugata.
Sugata...
We'll meet again.
Tomorrow, if Master allows it.
There's no need to hurry.
The time will come when jujutsu
and judo must contend.
Shall we wait till then?
- l remember
- l shall
l don't like him. He's like a snake.
The story now moves on
and we are introduced to Sayo.
Sayo is the daughter or Murai,
Higaki's master in jujutsu.
She is frightened
of Higakis shadowny presence.
Listen.
Higaki isn't our only enemy
here at the Shudokan school.
Today...
l had a meeting with
Police Commissioner Shimada.
He's invited Shudokan judo practitioners
to participate in the Police Martial Arts Tournament.
We'd be contending against others.
l told him we'd be delighted to participate.
Of course...
the police intend to appoint my students as instructors
if we prove ourselves in this competition.
What this means...
is that everyone else will be opposing our judo.
ln fact, l received this today.
lt's an invitation to the opening
of lnstructor Kiyatani's new jujutsu school.
Right at the end, it says...
''On the day, we would like to hold an exhibition match''
''between one of your senior students''
''and a jujutsu instructor.''
''Please send one of your senior students.''
Can you guess who the jujutsu instructor is?
This letter...
is not inviting me.
Sugata.
He's someone you know.
l understand.
He doesn't want to contend against Master.
He's from the Kassatsu school.
He wants revenge on Master
for throwing him into the river.
Sugata...
- This will be your job.
- Master!
Sugata...
Will you start practising tomorrow?
- Master!- But remember...
Don't imagine that Monma has
been idle all these months.
Master!
Start the match.
l'm ready!
- Come on!
- Shall we begin?
Come on
Here comes Sanshiro.
Don't dare touch Sanshiro.
Don't go near him or you'll be killed.
Don't touch him or make him angry.
Here comes Sanshiro...
''Don't touch him or make him angry... ''
Master Murai will contend against Sugata
at the Police Tournament.
l know.
The match will be very serious.
lt will be a fight to the death.
Miss Sayo...
Sugata is the man who threw Monma tohis death.
Children sing about him in terror.
My father will win.
l'd say you're being rather optimistic.
nce Father saw that match, he's stopped drinking completel
But he's old.
His complexion is better now than it ever was.
- Only that?
- Besides...
Well...
l'm making a vow for him.
Miss Sayo...
Of all jujutsu practitioners,
only l can beat him
- My father will win.
- No, he won't.
Only l can ensure your father's safety.
Miss Sayo...
My father will win!
Welcome home.
Look, Higaki.
l feel so different now that
l've left my life of dissipation.
l'm fortunate to
have a fine opponent.
He's strong... very strong.
He's sure to be picturing me as his opponent
as he trains like a fireball of fighting spirit.
Sanshiro Sugata...
TO LET
Excuse me, young lady.
Who are you looking for?
l'll get the person you want.
Sanshiro Sugata.
Sugata?
Priest, this is Monma's daughter.
l thought she was up to something.
Sanshiro is young.
He is bewildered by the
arrival of Monma's daughter.
That night, Yano trains him in the moonlit all.
Yano throws him again and again
until he is almost unconscious.
But as he staggers to his
feet and charges his teacher
he gradually comes to his senses.
Having been thus taught by his master,
Sanshiro is able to face the bright morning.
Look at her.
lsn't she beautiful?
Sugata...
Can you see where her beauty comes from?
She's completely selfless in her prayers.
She has discarded herself
and is at one with the god.
Nothing can be stronger than
the beauty she has now.
We should leave her alone.
We've seen something good.
l feel good.
- l'll do that for you.
- lt's all right.
You can't go home barefoot.
- lf l can have that, l'll do it.
- l'll do it quickly.
Now, rest your foot on this.
Thank you.
lt may be a little tight.
Thank you.
Your umbrella...
Your towel...
You left your towel.
- Please don't worry.
- l'll bring it to you.
- No.
- Where do you live?
- lt's all right.
- But...
l didn't know you were coming, so...
lt's all right.
- You've washed it. Thank you
- Thank you for your help.
What do you pray for everyday?
l pray for my father's victory.
What does your father do?
He's a jujitsu practitioner.
- May l ask your father's name?
- Hansuke Murai.
He's going to contend
against Shudokan judo.
Do you know the name of his opponent?
Yes, l do.
His name is Sanshiro Sugata.
My father said he was young,
but very strong.
l must be going,
please excuse me.
As a matter of fact, l...
l'm Sanshiro Sugata.
l wish your father luck.
Police Department
Martial Arts Tournament
What on earth is Sugata doing?
When we left, he was reading,
saying it was too early.
Damn! He's such a worry.
ldiot!
Why are you just sitting
there before an important match?
l can't, Priest.
- l can't possibly win.
- What?
Are you afraid of Murai?
No.
But there's someone between Murai and me.
- Who's that?
- His daughter.
- Are you in love with her?
- No.
lt's not that.
Priest...
l saw her praying for her father's victory.
Her face was totally selfless,
and very beautiful.
l'm troubled.
How can l overcome such beauty?
- Priest...
- ldiot!
Why can't you be as selfless as the woman?
- l can't.
- You can! You were once.
When was that, Priest?
Sanshiro Sugata of the
Shudokan was born there.
Have you forgotten your new life?
What is your life, Sanshiro?
Today's match is crucial.
Hurry, get ready.
You're a fortunate man.
Why?
The silly old man won't
let me take his place.
Don't be impatient.
One day we shall meet.
- Don't forget.
- l won't.
Come on, Sugata. Let's go.
Fight between Dragon and Tiger
Calm down. Look at Master.
Stay calm like him.
lnterschool Exhibition Match
lnstructor Murai of the Ryoi Shinto school.
Sanshior Sugata of Shudokan judo.
Why don't you address him as Mister?
- Damn you!
- Be quiet.
- Let's be fair.
- That's right.
- Keep out of it.
- Shut up!
A thirty-minute match.
There will be no referee.
Let's begin.
Father will win.
Father will win.
l'm sure you'll win.
l'm beaten
l concede.
End of match.
Mr Murai...
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr Sugata...
You're strong.
You contended admirably.
l'm no match for you.
The luck was with me.
Please take care.
Here comes Sanshiro.
Don't dare touch Sanshiro.
Don't go near him or you'll be killed.
Don't touch him or make him angry...
Sugata...
l used...
every ounce of my strength
in our match.
l've never done that
before in my whole life.
That was the best l could do.
When the match was over,
l felt my limbs had
been broken to pieces.
l felt very weak.
Anyway, l'm very
glad you visited us.
Let me thank you again.
l'm grateful.
l hope you didn't mind my
sending my daughter to you.
No.
Not at all.
l truly enjoyed our match.
l felt good even
when you threw me.
This is not the bluff of a loser.
Please join us for a meal.
Father, will you have your soup in bed?
No, l'll get up. l feel fine.
lt's delicious.
Sayo is a good cook.
''As promised, l challenge you to a duel''
''on the 26th of December at Kyogahara.''
''The witness will be Mr linuma.
''Practice suits shall be worn,
and only jujutsu may be used.''
''The match will take place in private,''
''as it will be a fight to the death.''
''Challenger: Gennosuke Higaki.''
''To Sanshiro Sugata.''
Wait!
My last question.
Do you have to fight?
Of course.
l knew you two would have to fight one day
But this is no ordinary match.
Duelling is prohibited.
lf you had allowed us
to contend last year
we wouldn't be risking our lives now.
l wouldn't like to lose either one of you.
Mr linuma...
We're young and stupid.
Please laugh at us.
We were destined to come to this.
Very well.
Begin.
No...
Damn.
Stop!
No!
lt's not over yet!
By the way...
l don't see Sanshiro today.
He suddenly decided to go on a trip.
Go on a trip? Why?
Well...
Perhaps he has something to think over.
He always gets so involved in things.
ls he haunted by
Higaki's hatred this time?
Higaki has changed
completely since their match.
He holds no grudge against Sugata.
ln that case,
what's bothering him?
Mr Yano...
Tell Sanshiro the following:
''lf you feel stuck and
don't know what to do,''
''you should come here''
''to see the stake in the lotus pond.''
Perhaps it won't be necessary.
Mr Yano, he seems to
have grown up at last.
No, not yet.
He's a man, but really still a baby.
Does it bother you
that l offered to come to
Yokohama to see you off?
No.
lt was my father
who insisted that l come.
lt's all right.
- What's the matter?
- l've got something in my eye.
ls it hurting badly?
l'll come back soon.
Take care of your father.
