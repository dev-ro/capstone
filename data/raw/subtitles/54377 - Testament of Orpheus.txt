ORPHEUS'S WLL
or DON'T ASK ME WHY.
The film producer can
make many people dream
the same dream together.
At the same time
he can show realistically...
unreal fantasy.
ln short, an admirable vehicle
for poetry.
My film is just a strip-tease show
where l take off my body
to reveal my soul.
For there is a vast shadow public
avid for the truth
which wll one day be
the sign of this era.
Here, then, is a poet's legacy
to the youth which has
always supported him.
As for my mortarboard
l'll send it to the time
from which l managed to escape.
The professor, please.
What are you ?
Are you his son?
My father was an architect.
l'd like to be a professor
but l can't be yet.
Very well then...
l'd forgotten my gloves.
l'd have to frighten him again.
Excuse me.
How charming!
This was my second meeting
wth a person
whose destiny l was
illogically complicating.
Don't be afraid.
l'm wearing this for a bet.
ls that the professor
in the invalid chair?
Yes, sir.
Can you explain...
lmpossible.
May l ask him something?
The professor
can neither hear nor speak.
When he was small
his mother had a shock...
and knocked him on his head.
He never suffered from it...
but one day...
A mistake!
The professor's life
hung on a thread.
lt broke.
At last l had the box
which was to set me free.
l caressed it lovingly.
lt's nothing.
l'll close my eyes...
then we can go on.
An injection, professor?
No, just leave me alone.
l'll be better in a moment.
lt's because of that fall.
You never know
what wll happen on account...
of these stupid accidents.
The baby professor ought
to have had another fall
but the eternal had made me
responsible for it.
Don't you recognize me?
lt seems to me...
Try hard.
Didn't l see you in my youth?
That's it.
l was only 1 3 but l remember.
l was frightened to death.
l'd like to understand...
Professor...
you're probably
the only person in the world
who wouldn't try to understand
and who's capable of understanding
the incomprehensible.
l wanted to know too much.
l was foolish
and l'm paying for it.
l wandered off into space-time.
l was looking for you.
This is the costume of the period
where a dangerous adventure
took me.
What year is it?
1 959.
Hell! lf l've worked it out right...
we should be in 2209.
l won't be living then.
Professor Langevin...
...was naïiïve like all scientists.
Only the 1 9th century
believed in exact sciences.
Professor Langevin didn't know
that time obeyed
the same laws as space.
250 years have passed
since you left
but your return cancels them.
And those 250 years
don't concern either of us.
Might l ask how you've managed
to travel through time?
Poets know a lot of things.
Perhaps more than we do.
Professor, it's not easy
to explain the eternal...
much less live in it.
lt's complicated.
l've just seen you several times...
not in chronological order
at different ages.
Only a minute ago
l saw you very old.
Your feeble hand dropped...
this box.
l took it.
And l think l did you...
and myself a service.
lt's wonderful to know...
that you are not just a humbug
and that l'll overcome
my difficulties.
Alas, l shall not be able
to reveal my discovery.
But for you it would die wth me.
Am l wrong?
That's fine, then.
Tell me, my dear sir...
as man to man...
did l die in your presence?
l have a very bad memory
for the future.
You recognize these?
l think so.
Only powder counts.
lt's because of them l am looking
for you through time.
l believe they travel
faster than light.
Let me be your guinea-pig.
lt's my salvation.
My only way back.
Have you a gun?
Only a crossbow.
l have a pistol in my drawer.
A scientist has to.
- You smoke?
- Certainly.
So as to smoke in 1 770...
l had to invent the cigarette.
They told me it was ridiculous
and would never catch on.
You know that for my experiment...
l must first kill you.
Relatively...
Sure you'll succeed?
No doubt at all.
l shall unfold time.
All your experience...
wll be wped out.
Oh yes?
You're not afraid?
Ready?
Fire!
The professor fully understood
that a mere change of clothes
was not sufficient
to ensure a change of time.
Good luck!
l owe you all!
But l'm not responsible
for what happens.
l'll take the risk.
l had recognized
the photo of Cégeste...
from my film Orpheus.
l didn't like him.
l suspected he was trying
to track me
and l'd better not follow.
Fate let me think
l was being imprudent...
throwng away his picture.
Cégeste!
You named me.
Hardly recognized you.
You were blonde.
ln a film.
But this is real life.
You were dead.
Like everyone.
Why come by sea?
Why! Always why.
Don't try to understand.
l've heard that before.
You wrote it.
Take this flower...
This flower is dead.
Aren't you a phenixologist?
What's that?
The science of dying
and being born again.
l don't like that.
Come, let's be going.
Where to?
Don't ask guestions.
Judith has cut off the head
of Captain
Nebuchadnezzar Holofernes.
A servant waits
at the door of the room
where it happened.
Judith is no longer
the daughter of a rich banker.
She is the sarcophagus
containing her own legend.
That is how she passes by moonlight
before the sleeping guards.
Now...
listen please, everybody!
Who was it who wove tapestry
and unwove it again?
Penelope.
And who was she?
Penelope was the last trial
Ulysses had to undergo.
Very good.
What does this tapestry show?.
Judith and Holofernes.
And who made it?
Jean Cocteau.
Who is Jean Cocteau?
A violinist?
That's right.
And what sort of violin
does he play on?
A Stra...
A Stra...
A Strad...
A Stratagem?
No, not a stratagem.
A Stradivarius.
Now let's clap hands
for our little candidate.
Hurry up! The cock's crowng.
Turn night into day.
We'll see who gives orders...
and who obeys them.
Yes, works of art
make themselves.
They hate their parents.
They existed
before the artist
discovered them.
But always Orpheus and Oedipus...
l thought when l changed
castles l'd change ghosts,
and a flower
would drive them away.
Don't insist.
An artist paints his own portrait.
You'll never paint this flower.
Blast and hell!
Aren't you ashamed?
lt's up to you.
Show us what you can do.
''On our way.''
''Where to?''
''The goddess.''
''What goddess?''
''Some call her Pallas,
others Minerva.
So be careful.''
And if l refuse?
Orders!
l don't advise you to disobey.
And the flower?
Give it to her.
Goddesses are women after all.
l won't go.
''You left me alone
where the dead aren't dead.''
''Obey.''
''l obey.''
Hello!
Hello what?
Please excuse me.
l must be the victim
of an hallucination.
What are you doing here?
l ask guestions.
We are a court of inguiry
before which you'll have
to explain your activities.
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
Read the charges.
You are accused of innocence...
which is to say
you're capable of any crime
instead of just one
and liable to fall
under our jurisdiction.
You are also accused of trying
to enter illegally a world
not your own.
Guilty or not guilty?
Guilty in both cases.
l'm haunted by crimes
l have not committed.
l've often tried to jump
over the mysterious wall
on which men write their loves
and their dreams.
Why?
Through boredom
and dislike of habits.
Also through disobedience
and that spirit of creation
which is the acme of contradiction
inherent is us.
lf l am not mistaken...
Disobedience is a religion wth you.
Without it
what would children, heroes...
and artists do?
Count on their lucky stars.
We are not here to make speeches.
Put that flower on the table.
Where did you get it?
Cégeste gave it me.
Cégeste?
lsn't that a temple in Sicily?
lt's also the poet in my film.
Before, it was the name
of an angel in my poem.
What is a film?
A film is a petrifying source
of thought.
lt brings dead acts to life.
lt makes it possible to give...
apparent reality to the unreal.
What is unreal?
What is beyond our limits.
So there are people
like a sleeping invalid
dreaming they are healthy.
Excellent definition of a poet.
And what is a poet?
One who, by making poems...
uses a language
neither alive nor dead
which few people speak...
and few understand.
And why do they speak
this language?
To get in touch wth their peers
in a world
where exhibitionism
consists of revealing one's soul
and is carried on by the blind.
Who are you?
His adopted son.
My real name is Edward.
l'm a painter.
He says you're a poet
and your name is Cégeste.
ls Cégeste a nickname?
Pen name would be nearer the mark.
Your French language
is very subtle.
A few minutes ago you used...
an idiom you have no right
to use in this world.
True enough.
l did so in a moment of anger.
Don't do it again.
Who gave you the right
to appear to this man...
and give him this flower?
This flower was dead.
l was ordered to give it him
so he could revive it.
Can you give proof of your powers?
Disappearing won't convince us.
Disappearing's not nice.
No more than...
the phenomenon which makes
men who love
free the loved one.
You're mad!
Sorry! lt happens to me too.
l advise you not to make
heavy humour...
about things which may reveal
human vanity.
Have no fear on that score.
We want proof of your powers.
l share his opinion...
that what can be proved is vulgar.
You must take my word.
Trying to teach me?
That's the end.
l've noted that.
l'm listening.
Did you write...
''This body which holds us
does not know our being.
''That which inhabits us
is inhabited.
''And these bodies
inside one another
are the bodies of eternity.''
Yes, l wrote it.
And who told you this?
What?
These things you say.
No one.
You lie!
All right, if you agree
we are subject to a force
which guides and dictates to us.
lt's possible he's mad.
Or an intellectual.
Leporello pretended to be his master.
The poet's like that.
Stop chattering.
And listen to me.
l was humbly explaining.
You don't have to be humble.
Just reply to our guestions.
You're just a mixture
of forests and swamps and rivers
populated by enormous beasts
which eat one another.
Don't try to be clever.
Your address?
l live here wth a friend
whose host l am.
What's that?
There aren't any here where we are.
We're nowhere.
And yet l've just seen a tapestry
decorating the house...
l'm speaking of.
You may well have seen
this tapestry...
but that's because we wanted
you to see it.
We can't help your credulity.
Bring the wtness.
Where am l?
That is guestion
unworthy of a man of science.
lt's the sort of thing
a pretty woman
would say on waking.
l was asleep in bed...
You still are asleep, professor.
You just don't dream us.
You're occupying
one of those folds in time
which you have been the studying.
Research which honours
your intelligence...
but of which we disapprove.
When you wake up...
you'll remember us as if
we were people in your dream.
You know this man?
You've a short memory, professor.
Of course, you're asleep.
You've just destroyed
my Louis XV chrysalis,
cape, boots, jabot, white wg,
whip, spurs and all.
l don't complain.
You warned me
you couldn't be responsible.
Why are you here?
Here, gentlemen,
it is l who give orders.
So be guiet and answer my guestions.
How...
did you meet this man?
- Quite simple.
- So you say.
Silence!
l was giving up hope of completing
my methods of resurrection
and l'd have given up
if this man,
endowed wth powers
of which l know nothing
had not left our continuum
to make a journey through eternity
and returned from my future
to my present
proving l had succeeded.
l made the experiment on him.
l'd add that for fear of losing
my colleagues' esteem
l threw my discovery into the Seine
which flows past my wndow.
So you succeeded
in restoring a man lost in time?
Only just.
l saved him from his own trap
where he had felt.
And made me fall into another...
the sort of twilight
in which l move
since l left your laboratory.
l'm sorry about that.
lt's possible
my discovery is not perfect.
l'm glad l destroyed it.
What form...
does this discovery take?
A box of bullets
that travel faster than light.
lt was the box l threw away.
Let's hope
there'll be no ill effects.
lt was the wse thing to do.
By proudly disorganizing...
even the unsuccessful measures...
taken throughout
your world's history...
men run the risk
of breaking a chain...
and call it progress.
But you are condemning
all of science.
What you call science!
There is one of the soul
which is more important.
l beg of you...
Excuse me.
What could you say
if you had to defend this man?
That he is a poet,
which makes him indispensable
though l don't know what for.
May l now ask you a guestion?
We'll see if l can reply.
Mere curiosity
of a man of science...
Here it is... what time is it?
There is no time, professor.
Go on sleeping.
You are free.
Thank you.
l seem to have difficulty...
a sort of fatigue...
Sleep.
Sleep, professor.
l want you to.
My respects to you, madam.
l'm sleeping.
Pleasant dreams.
l'm well aware that your road
is a labyrinth
far distant from ours...
although the two overlap...
and though you might discover
someone to correct
your disobedience
of terrestrial laws...
this was not due
to a distraction of the unknown...
but a sort of supreme indulgence...
which you sometimes abuse...
and which you may lack one day.
lf l exceed my responsibilities...
it is because l wanted
to warn you...
before consulting your guide
on his privileges...
and responsibilities.
l don't understand.
You don't have to.
Don't play the village idiot.
l think you understand very well
but are playing the fool
so as not to own up.
But, madam...
Silence!
Consider yourself lucky
that the court is being indulgent.
Come here.
Yes... you.
Are you sure
you didn't take the initiative
in merging these personalities
because having two annoyed you?
Weren't you tempted
to make only one
at the service of this man
who is not only...
your father but your adopted father?
Madam, you must be informed
regarding the infinity
of reigns and orders
which makes it difficult to know
what persons should obey others
and who should be obeyed.
Quite so.
What strange road did you take
in order to appear?
Through fire and water.
The result, l presume...
of laws of which l am the slave
and must obey.
Since you persist
l would at least like to know
what is the extent
of your power of metamorphosis.
Don't look astonished.
l'm speaking of the change
of an orchid into a death head.
This macabre masguerade
corresponded, l suppose,
to phenomena
of a resurrectional nature.
Was it just to impress this man...
or in some way
to warn him?
No, this is a ceremonial rite
of which l can say no more.
The accused refuses to reply.
Take a note of that.
Have you anything further
to say in your defence?
lf l deserve punishment
there is none worse
than living between two elements.
Or, in your terms,
between two reigns.
ln film language, ''false colours''.
l'd give anything
to walk the earth again
instead of losing myself
in the universe.
Outside our competence.
The court wll decide.
The rogatory commission
condemns you...
to the sentence of life.
The minimum.
And at your age.
Your flower.
And the princess...
You know that she claimed
to transgress the laws of time.
And Orpheus?
He didn't survive.
And Eurydice went back to hell.
A great human voice said...
''Don't spit against the wnd.''
Take the flower.
l don't dare to.
lt's not the first time
or the last l take this flower
and give it back.
This time l understand
the courage of your act
and the risk you run...
she and you.
We can't be worse off.
What have you been condemned to?
To judge others.
To be judges.
Not amusing.
l find this rogatory
commission suspect.
Our works kill their authors
and get away.
But... the creatures
of our imagination
are still suspicious
about their origins.
l wonder...
Best not to.
l wonder if you yourself...
lt's possible.
Sometimes l'm annoyed wth you.
Sometimes l'm glad l live
outside the world where l was.
But l'd like to save you
from your situation.
But we know nothing
of yesterday and tomorrow
you humans are subjected to them,
and to succeed l must guide you
or rather follow
you through obstacles
after which l shall obtain
what l want.
Couldn't you enlighten me
as to the obstacles?
l don't know them myself.
l'm at sea.
The only thing l know
is that this flower
is made of your blood
and follows your destiny.
l've already told you too much.
Just obey.
l'll obey.
Your Ladyship?
Who's the murderer?
l don't know, My Lady.
lncredible!
You're making me read
right through a book
which wll only be published
in 70 years.
Excuse me, My Lady.
Damn your excuses!
Who are these gentlemen?
What gentlemen, My Lady?
These two strangers
who walk in my house.
l see no one, My Lady.
You think l'm mad?
Oh, My Lady!
You can go.
What times we live in!
Everything's going badly today.
ls it she?
Don't be ridiculous.
She is just out of date.
You should know that can happen.
Very odd dogs.
PRlVATE PROPERTY
TRAPS
ls it she?
No, that's lsolde.
She's on every boat
looking for Tristan.
l think l went wth Cégeste
past the Saint-Pierre Chapel
that l painted in 1 957
as my own coffin presented
to the Beaulieu fishermen
in memory of my past youth
and to the fishermen
of Villefranche, where l lived.
Well, what is it?
Didn't you see him?
Just as l see you.
He ignored me.
You said if you met him
you'd cut him.
He hates me.
He has reason to.
He's taken your insults.
l'll kill him.
You may be immortal,
but if you do
you'll find nobody else.
Where was he going?
More guestions!
He's probably going
where you come from.
You spend your time trying to be.
That turns you away from life.
Mustn't keep the gods waiting.
l am the key to dreams...
the sad column...
the Virgin in the lron Mask.
ls that she?
Your fault, Peleponnesus.
Other dangers threaten
for at night statues
are dressed in black
and murder travellers.
l myself am not a bust...
l've enough sea spume in my veins
to understand wave language.
Washing their linen on their knees
they're insulting you,
making fun of you.
lntellectual lovers.
Autograph, please?
Who is the idol
who is eating autographs?
A machine for making
you famous in a minute.
Afterwards?
One must be known... Uneasy!
ln advanced countries,
the working days are short.
What's coming out?
Novels, poems, song, and so on.
The machine stops till
autograph hunters feed it.
Then it digests,
meditates and sleeps.
Six eyes and four mouths.
Don't ask me why.
Well, l must leave you now.
Sorry, it's orders.
Who gives them?
Even if l knew l wouldn't say.
Stay wth us, Cégeste.
You think you can live wth men
for they condemn to death?
Don't leave me.
Anyhow you must have
a mirror to disappear.
Mirrors reflect too much.
They think they are profound.
How wll you go?
Close your eyes.
Open them.
Where are you?
Very far and very near.
On the other side of the medal.
l've said it often enough.
''Aren't you tired of trying
to understand for 70 years?''
Where are you, Cégeste?
''Where you put me.''
''Where you put me.''
l was so tired
l though l could hear
the women kneeling
making fun of me
at their washing.
lf you'd be kind enough
to wait a minute,
the Minister wll receive you.
l waited.
l waited.
l waited.
ln a few minutes...
the President wll receive you.
l waited...
l was still waiting.
lf you would be so kind
to wait a few minutes...
His Serene Highness's first
secretary wll receive you.
There were a lot of minutes
and l waited still.
lf you wll wait a few minutes...
His Majesty wll receive you.
lf you wait long enough...
you change into a waiting room.
Give up all hope.
l was afraid of it.
Should l sign my name?
Not necessary.
Go straight in.
Lazarus did not smell
too good either.
There is even a picture
wth Martha and Mary
covering their noses...
Excuse me...
How horrible!
How horrible... how horrible!
Pretend to weep, friends,
since the poets are
only pretending to be dead.
The Sphinx, Oedipus...
what we wanted to know...
it is possible to meet him,
one day
wthout seeing it.
From this walking sleep
l awoke on a road
and as l was wondering
which way to go
l thought l heard the motorcyclists
of my film Orpheus.
l knew their job.
l had to suffer the same fate
as Cégeste.
But l was wrong...
They were speed cops.
- Your papers?
- Why?
A man on foot
is normally suspect.
Hurry! Follow me.
The earth, after all,
is not the place for you.
Ask him for a signature.
Well, what d'you know!
So there we are.
Ajoyous wave has just swept
over my parting film.
lf you didn't like it, l'm sorry
for l put all into it
like all the workers of my team.
My flower is a hibiscus flower.
lf you recognized
one or two famous actors,
they weren't in the film
because they are famous
but because they suit their parts
and are my friends.
