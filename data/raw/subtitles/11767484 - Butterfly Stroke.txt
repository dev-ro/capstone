Don't cry, mum
tell me what's happened
Hello? Talk to me
- Mum?
- Hang up!
Are you kidding me?
You said it wouldn't need paint
I told you
it wouldn't be like the first day
It needed paint
I can't mend it by spitting on it!
You were clumsy
or you could do it!
- I'm sorry!
- Be sorry!
Parvaneh? What's this film?
How it's gone viral?
I don't know
Hashem's gone to the swimming pool
he may hurt people
I don't understand you, sit down
Who could take a mobile
into the damn swimming pool?
I don't know, by God I don't!
Drink it
There were so many women there
how they recorded you only?
I have no idea...
Drink it
Let's go and stop Hashem
he is sick
He'll make trouble
and we'll regret it all his life
Stay here, I'll bring him
I didn't come here
so you treat me like others
Parvaneh! No one thinks you're at fault all
I'm saying is that he is angry right now
I'm his wife, not his enemy!
What should I run away from?
- Okay, but you can't come now
- What do you mean?
The innocent won't run away, Hojjat
If they'd recorded your own wife
in a women's swimming pool
it went viral, and your wife ran away
what would you think about her?
Help us, God!
Why they don't move?
Let's walk the rest
Dear God
Run, run!
Hashem?
Hashem!
Hashem?
Bastard
Hashem! Hashem!
Bastard
Hashem! Hashem! Look at me!
- Don't do this, my son is scared
- Shut up
Hashem!
- Aren't you the owner of this place?
- Hashem!
- Who recorded the film?
- Listen to me
Who recorded the film?
There's always a guard here
So your mother recorded the film here?
Come out!
Please don't
Parvaneh is at the door!
I swear she is
Bastards
Go out!
Back off!
Go!
What have you done, Parvaneh?
What you did!
What have I done, dear?
My fault is I taught swimming
to some children
You disgraced me
Don't say that, Hashem
for God's sake, don't!
When you say that
I feel I don't have anybody
All our troubles are
because of this neighbourhood
You were lucky you left
and you're living peacefully now
We'll move from
this neighbourhood too, don't we?
Yes, mum?
Why do you keep calling?
Yes, they're both with me
I don't know anything
They're with me here!
What can I tell him? Mum?
Hello, father
Nothing's happened to anybody
Hashem! Hashem!
Hashem! Hashem! Hashem!
Hashem!
Hashem!
Hashem! What did you do?
Give that to me!
Fill in the form
and send the body to Forensics
The car will be impounded
don't leave the town
Do you want water?
You didn't want bad for them
How could you know
Hashem would do this?
Don't blame yourself for everything
Hashem had calmed down
He had, Afsaneh!
By God he'd calmed down!
But I was so clumsy...
Get up, darling, let's go in
Calm down your mother
I can't soothe her
My God!
Who can I calm down?
I made a mistake
I took Parvaneh there
She wanted to go there
but I shouldn't have accepted
Go in
Go, I come now
Did you see?
Your brother bashed my teeth but
I didn't say anything because I respect you
It's a hit-and-run world!
You'll be hit if you don't hit!
Poor Parvaneh!
Do you understand our situation?
Do you understand anything?
Hojjat!
Where's Parvaneh?
Where's Hashem?
Someone help me!
My Hashem is dishonoured!
You don't let me visit Parvaneh's family
at least take me to visit Hashem
Stop blabbering!
You want to thank Hashem or congratulate
Ahmad we killed their daughter?
I begged Parvaneh not to stay here
not to be before Hashem's eyes
What was Parvaneh's fault, mum?
I told her not to work in the swimming
pool, but she didn't listen
Many women work there, Parvaneh
was unfortunate she was recorded
Parvaneh wasn't unfortunate
We made her unfortunate
by marrying her off to that wolf!
Everybody knows
Hashem adored Parvaneh
My son was enraged
he couldn't control herself
Don't say that!
Say that to your brother who took him
to his drinking bouts since he was 7
Then yelling in the neighbourhood
to show he was his nephew
Shut your gob!
You only nag when there's trouble, oaf!
I could control this one
but not that gorilla?
They're living decently
but what about Hashem?
He was happy he was the top bully
in the neighbourhood...
and everybody was afraid of him
Now he's deep in shit!
- It can't be done without a lawyer
- But it can without a baby!
I'll come up with the money again
How? My surgery is next month
What should I do?
Forget my brother
and pay the money to have a baby?
You could get one of the lawyers
the court provides
They don't do anything
At least you could tell me
you were emptying our account
I told you now
- Hashem doesn't have money?
- What are you saying?
I'm ashamed to tell him
to pay for the lawyer
After all he did for us? I was
in jail for five years and looked after us
Now it's time to make up
Poor Parvaneh will come back to life
if Hashem comes out?
Hojjat! Look at me
Thank you
It's good
You said Hashem's psychosis
would be proven with his medical record
Forensics report and the crime scene report
say it was sudden anger, not psychosis
I've got his medical record
for service exemption
local petition for his recurrent psychosis
but I don't know
why they don't affect the court's ruling
So what?
What's gonna happen?
You must convince the victim's next of kin
to withdraw their complaint
Wait here, I have to fill out a form
I'll be right back
So you couldn't do anything, right?
Drink this
- It's a little
- No!
My son! I love you, son!
Please, Mr Ahmad!
Don't do this!
Please, I'm begging you
forgive him
I want to talk to him!
Mr Ahmad!
I swear you by Parvaneh's soul!
Wait a second
I wasn't myself that night
Parvaneh wasn't my wife only
she was my life
You know me
Everybody bowed to me
in that neighbourhood
And I bowed to Parvaneh at home
I treated her most tenderly
Those bastards found out she was my root
they cut my root
I don't know who did it
I'll kill him if I find him
I've never been so desperate
I don't want you to take back your
complaint I'll be relieved when you hang me
- I want you to only forgive me
- Move
I couldn't bear a town
watching my wife naked
I couldn't!
- Move
- Move, sir
I don't want anything from you
but to forgive me
- Move
- Move, sir
Please forgive me
- Move
- Move, sir
I called the electricity department
it'll be connected in half an hour
Come eat, mom
Don't upset yourself
Come, mum
Come, dad
Come, dad
- Dad, you said you liked herbs stew
- Don't cry, mum
Not all who get death penalty are hanged
don't upset yourself
I'm not dead
I'll follow his case
Mr Ahmad will hopefully get back
his complaint too
Come eat
Mr Ahmad!
If you don't open the door today
I won't go anywhere
I'm upset with Hashem like you
I swear by Parvaneh's soul
if it wasn't for her grieving mother
I'd never come here
We've known each other for 40 years
By God I haven't come here
so you take back your complaint
Hello
Why have you come, then?
To rub it in?
I came to say I'm sorry
I didn't look after your daughter well
No, you didn't none of you did!
If you had a grain of Parvaneh's kindness
to you, it wouldn't have come to this
- By God we had it
- No, you didn't!
If you had it, you wouldn't come here
and ask me to forgive her killer
Hashem couldn't control himself
I can't control myself either
I'll hang him!
Mr Ahmad! Please!
Nothing will be all right
by hanging Hashem
What became all right
by killing my daughter?
Our honour returned?
The bastard who'd recorded
the film was found?
Don't you say she's like
your daughter, like your sister?
If it'd happened to your sister
wouldn't you look for the one
who recorded and distributed the film?
You didn't because you didn't care
"Never mind! My brother is in
jail and Parvaneh is buried"
"We'll put a gravestone on the shame
and avoid the trouble"
- It wasn't like that
- Why didn't you find him, then?
You take care of your honour by killing?
You should've found out
who gave an excuse to that beast
How could we look for a needle
in a haystack?
I'm telling you for the first and last time
Don't come here again till you find
that bastard and bring him here
I won't forgive Hashem
I swear to Parvaneh's soul I won't!
How? Where?
The way I asked around
and was told who has posted the film
You know who he is?
The CID has told him it was first posted
by a SIM card that belonged to a Reza Zare
He was a tramp
He escaped from Shafaq rehab
the last time
Yes, he's got more descriptions too
I'll come over and tell you
Okay, bye
Dear God...
I'll find him wherever he is
When he said
we put a stone on Parvaneh's dishonour
I just wanted to die with shame
It's much more than dying that he thinks
we didn't care about Parvaneh's honour
Don't cry, don't, dear
I've lost everything
I don't like Hashem
You are all I have
I'm satisfied with you
I hope God will be satisfied with you too
- Don't!
- I wish your touch turns ash to gold
I love you, dad!
Don't do that, dear
I'll find him, I'm not a milksop
Hashem will hopefully come out live
decently and you'll be satisfied with him
Hojjat!
Get your brother's hand
and pull him out of the well
Sure, dear, I will!
Thanks, dear
- To everybody, the good ones, to bros!
- Cheers!
- To bros!
- Cheers!
Nice!
- Together to the noose!
- Cheers!
Are you drunk or high?
They caught him among your tramps
and took him to Shafaq rehab
Nobody's seen him for a year
Maybe he's returned to your hidey-hole
Mosayeb
- His name is Reza Zare
- Mosayeb
Don't know his title
- He has a big burn mark on his belly
- He has a big burn on his tummy
No, don't do anything
we'll take care of it
Will your men be there at night?
I'll call you then
Thanks
Thank you so much
Done! He does what I say
I called because
we couldn't go there without calling
I'll get the bastard even if I have
to slice Milad Tower to toothpicks!
Cut the moan!
Sing something cheerful
- To brother Mosayeb, the best host!
- To Mosayeb!
- To brother Hashem and his release!
- Cheers!
Hi, Jamshid
sorry to keep you waiting
- Tell him to watch my car too
- Sure
Careful they don't nick you with syringes
when you're sacking
Don't worry, get off, you!
- Anybody over there, Jamshid?
- About 30
You three go there
you come with me
Reza Zare!
- You Reza Zare?
- No
Pull up your shirt!
- Reza Zare!
- Pull up your shirt!
- Pull up your shirt!
- You know me, Jamshid
Out!
- You know Reza Zare?
- No
- Pull up your damn shirt!
- Now what?
You fancy watching my belly?
Higher!
- Reza Zare is here?!
- Cut the crap!
Reza Zare!
Who's Reza Zare?
- What's that scar?
- Had a surgery
- What surgery?
- My intestine
- He's got a burn mark on his belly
- No, I don't know him
Say if you've seen anything
- You don't know Reza Zare?
- No, never saw him
You're Reza Zare?
Get up! Pull up your shirt
Move it! Out!
- What is it?
- Did it myself
Keep him there
Jamshid, Hojjat!
He's found someone, let's go!
He and Reza Zare were close
he had a burn mark too
Jaber!
- We searched every one sir
- Jaber, come out!
- What's the matter?
- Come out
- It's him, sir
- What the hell do you want? Who are they?
Where is Reza Zare?
I told them earlier
we lived together for two years
but he's gone underground for a year
- What do you mean?
- Under the ground, dead!
Don't make me hit the roof
or I'll halve you in two!
I live on the roof already!
No need to halve me!
Answer him
Answer him, shit bag!
Tell them!
I told them everything
Say it again you know Reza Zare?
We left the rehab together
he was out for two months and then died
- Died how?
- Assassinated on the plane!
- Ran out of fuel!
- Stop being funny!
What the hell, man?
What question is that?
How tramps die?
They die because taking too much drugs
or not taking any, or they froze to death
I didn't do an autopsy on him!
He slept with us at night
but didn't wake up with us in the morning!
- Tell them to leave me alone, Jamshid
- Talk properly
- Was I wrong to say I know him?
- Cut the bullshit, stuffy!
I'll set you all on fire!
Where in the north he's from, you said?
I never said he's from the north
the one I knew was from Arak
Maybe he's someone else
Let's go, Mosayeb
Hojjat!
- I'll thrash him and make him talk
- He's telling the truth
He's not from the north
I knew he was from Arak
If he was lying, he'd say
he was from the north to mislead us
Hey! Let's go!
Don't do that to yourself
How finding this guy
helps poor Parvaneh?
That's what Parvaneh wanted
I don't know where I was hit
I haven't heard this jerk's name
I've become desperate like a dog
Thinking day and night
who hit me so hard
This Reza Zare, he may be
a relative of those around you
Haven't you fought someone
any grudge, someone who's after you?
Whoever I've fought wasn't spiteful
case closed right there and then
A strong guy like you stands up to you
and say everything
We must look for someone
who can't match you
I'm sick of myself!
Poor Parvaneh was the victim
of my pig-headedness
Forget it, Hojjat
let them kill me
This wild beast is Hashem!
He eats people
in Liang Shan Po Woods!
Where are those days?
I'm not dead, brother
Think and tell me
who you suspect the least
I know Mr Ahmad well
He may lose his head
but not his promise
He'll forgive me if he's found, but I
don't want you to make trouble for yourself
What are you saying?
I'm with you
We'll find him
Mosayeb and the guys will help too
Forget Mosayeb he's out on bail
for the swimming pool brawl
He's more brainless than me
He'll cause more trouble
and that guy who did this
is hiding somewhere
You must find him with your own mind
I'll tell Mosayeb to help
if you're stuck somewhere
But try to do it yourself
Okay, whatever you say
Just tell me where to start
Hello
- How are you, Hojjat?
- Hello, Miss Sarvar
- Any news of Hashem?
- Thank God
Is Ashkan in?
- How's your mother?
- Says hello
What a business!
It's for the prayers of these needy women
may God help my son!
Whatever God wills will happen
How are you, Hojjat?
Long time no see!
- What brought you here?
- Lost my way!
Welcome!
- We miss brother Hashem
- That's why you've made such a business!
He'll come out don't doubt it
- Why is that?
- My heart says so
You have a pure heart then
he's coming out
Serious?
- When?
- Is that bad?
Why bad?
- They took back their complaint?
- They will
Something wrong?
This is all a cover
where's your real business?
No real business
it's all there is
- There's another side
- There isn't
Hashem said
you bring the bottles from Baneh
I bring a few sealed bottles
sell them, and earn peanuts
He said to take me to Baneh
You really expected me to believe
your mother makes pickles...
and you guard the aubergines?
Nobody knows I make booze here
My friends think I bring
bottles from Baneh
Hashem has heard about it in jail
Where is Baneh?
You travel to Marivan
then Saqqez, and then Baneh!
Thank you, this way?
Thanks, Mrs. Sarvar
Go away!
All there is!
Get to work
Wow!
Water, alcohol, colour, and pills!
What a mix!
Hashem told me
you were to fill these with Arak
And each bottle had 200 grand profit
but it wasn't enough for you
What to do?
Add water and alcohol
Made in Ashkan the Cock, right?
Right
Meisam, out
So, Hashem suggested this
He told you who and where to buy
the original bottles from
- He fixed the uptown sellers, right?
- Right
It isn't!
If it was right, you'd be his man now
instead using your
mother as a cover, right?
Hashem is the boss, I nobody
when he comes out...
Who is "I"?
You're nobody!
Who are you?
Who were you?
You made a little booze in your
mother's pressure cooker, at most!
Not with raisin
because you couldn't afford it
You used sugar!
I'm not a child anymore
Hashem has always been kind
to the neighbourhood guys
If he hadn't taught me this
I'd be making crystal here
- You were greedy
- Knock it off!
You ruined Hashem's life for your greed
You sent someone
to record his poor wife
- So you wouldn't have a boss, right?
- No, it isn't!
I would never betray Hashem
why should I do such a thing?
Hashem helped in everything
knew everything better than me
He even gave me money
to start this business
Was I stupid to get rid of him
and then stage a fake accidents
for insurance money?
Look at my leg!
If I'd done such a thing
at least I'd leave this neighbourhood
Why didn't you? Why?
- Because I haven't done it!
- Out!
Get out!
You too
Out!
Hashem never done anything bad to me
so I decide to avenge him
by dishonoring him
If he suspects me
and you've come to ask me
tell him I'm grateful to him
You burnt me!
My greed is I pour water and alcohol
in the bottles in place of booze
But I don't give it to the guys
in the neighbourhood
Let's hope you're telling the truth
Or Hashem won't let you breathe!
You know him, right?
I'm not ungrateful
you shouldn't be either
I don't gamble on the honour of someone
who backed me up like my late brother
Two grand
You won
- You bet on 10
- Deal
Roll it
Roll it
4 and 5 is 9
You lost, Hojjat
Shapoor, Hojjat is gambelling too?
- What's brought you here?
- Ill fate!
You're up
What did you do about that arm?
You got the compensation?
I never get compensation
I use only one arm
- You're winning today
- Not bad, thank God
Shapoor?
You should thank God when you gamble?
God grants sustenance in His own way
You must be very God-fearing
with so much sustenance!
Come with me
Back off!
Yes?
Why do you want him to win easily?
You want to ruin my money?
Win easily?! He's playing well
good for him!
Besides, you've made so much money
because of Hashem
Did they pay?
They want to leave
Yes, they paid
I swear to God I've lost everything
since they caught your brother
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing
I'm just playing on my brother's account
Here doesn't make money
like the old times
A bunch of also-rans
play here for peanuts
It's not like before when they played big
- Why?
- Just because!
They're afraid to lose their money
You were here for only half an hour
and everybody was like a goat!
Lots of things happen here
- So it was paradise when Hashem was here
- Of course
They came here from far neighbourhoods
to play for his sake
It wasn't like now with no money
You didn't pay him
the last few months, right?
You should've told that sooner!
So you've come
to settle your brother's account
Yes, I have
I'm hard-up now
I'm preparing dowry for my niece
You were badly hurt the last day
he turned here upside-down, right?
Yes, I was
But he was drunk
and I thought it was because of that
So he was drunk...
Do you have women around you too?
Do I look like an auntie?
You think I sent someone
to disgrace Hashem's wife?
I know what honor is
I've turned myself into this
so these jerks stop bothering me
Thought you might be capable of doing
anything like your scumbag husband
Watch your tongue!
The scumbag was your uncle
Parviz the Heathen, not the late Shapoor
Why are you questioning me?
I haven't done anything to be afraid of
Your brother has always been kind to me
Okay!
Hojjat!
I swear I don't know who did it
Whoever it was, don't let him live!
I won't!
We'll stay for the night?
Yes
They call so often and ask us
to come here, they need help
- Why do you look like that?
- Nothing
That's not what "nothing" looks like!
You didn't go to the garage today
No, I didn't
- You know you must pay its rent too?
- Yes
The doctor said
I shouldn't miss my appointment
You won't
Come out, mole!
Come out, snitch!
Come out, snitch! Come out if you dare
I'll ruin whoever talks to him
in this neighbourhood!
Lower your voice!
You know my mother is sick
He's snitched!
Maybe the snitching had nothing to do
with Hashem or Hojjat
Who's to blame for Ashkan's shop
my brother's place, the gamble-house?
- Respect your neighbours
- What Respect?!
Wherever he went yesterday
was raided by the cops at night
They caught everybody
Hojjat! Come out, mole!
Where are you, Mosayeb?
Come quickly!
Where did you put the key, father?
We can't stay here
I want to go out
- To do what?
- They're disgracing us
Mosayeb said not to go out alone
why do you disgrace us?
What did you do yesterday?
Where did you go?
I must find out what you've done
only when they come to the door?
I swear I haven't done anything!
Don't add fuel to the fire!
- You've become like Hashem already?
- I know nothing about it
I have nothing to do with them
to give them away
I don't know them
Why don't you let him talk to them?
They have a problem with him
they haven't come to talk to him
- You talk to them
- Me?!
- Yes
- They'll swallow me!
We can't stay here
Back off!
You're getting on my nerve!
Are you blind, deaf, or what?
They're disgracing us
- We can't do anything
- Should we do nothing then?
Enough, you want to ruin our life again?
Afsaneh, please don't get
on my nerve! Go sit there
Calm down, she left
You're all getting my back up
I'm not going to fight them or kill them
- He wants to kill you!
- I want to talk to them
But they are not here to talk!
Why do you ruin our life?
Why you pushed him into this?
Who pushed him?
They have attacked here
We've seen such things a lot
thanks to Hashem
It's not something new
Don't bicker with them and they'll leave
See?
My God!
Come, Mohammad!
- Come, Mohammad!
- Bastard
Come, Mohammad!
Come, Mohammad!
You Jerks
I got these
Take them there
Here, Miss
- Thank you
- Your welcome
Don't worry it's nothing serious
Don't you need anything?
They ruined Hashem and Parvaneh's life
it is our turn now
Can we leave?
Shut the door and come here
I need to talk to you
Let's have a smoke together
You've been here for an hour
and I was alone in there
I can't take it, can you?
Who had a problem with you
to set you up?
That's the one I must find
- You'll forget Hashem's story?
- I won't forget anything any more
You must move the piece
you've touched!
So what?
Why my problems began as soon as I got
involved with the film and swimming pool?
Your brain's locked!
That's why you're mixing everything
Give it here!
That's the way they are
They fall to one side suddenly
You were my friend before becoming
my brother-in-law, right?
I'm your friend now too
you saw for yourself
You're still in contact
with your old colleagues?
Yes, how come?
The guard listens to you?
Hasn't said no to me ever
We'll find him!
This story has no end
what are you going to do?
Forget it!
Didn't you see Afsaneh?
I'll find him!
Nader!
I saw you diving
My darlings!
I told you diving is forbidden, champs!
- I'll win 100 in 10 minutes
- Let's begin
15 minutes, not 10
and I'll pay the one who stays till the end
Must we stay too?
Come to the car and give us a price
we want to leave
Go play
They'll have pneumonia
I will have pneumonia
they are strong
Couldn't lure them into your house
so you made them a swimming pool!
Don't say that!
That's indecent!
- What's the model?
- 2015
2015...
The wing's been painted
- Hojjat is a mechanic
- You have the price
Looks good
- Hojjat says the boot floor is weak
- It is
- Let me see it
- The key
It's been hammered bad
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Get in you bastard
- Get him
- Come out, you animal
Mohammad give me the keys
Don't move where's your mobile?
I called the doctor, he said he won't be
here for five days
Thank you, Jalil
Only this one?
Thanks man, move!
Call your wife
and tell her you won't go home tonight...
without arousing her suspicion, call her
- But...
- Do it! Do it!
- Please! I need a puff
- Good time to quit!
Hojjat!
Everybody knows I went on pilgrimage
two years ago and repented
- I'm clean
- sit here
Give me the cuffs, shut up!
I've always talked highly of you
in the neighbourhood
I said you're not like your uncle or Hashem
and you mind your own business
I did mind my own business
but not any more
You'll all stay here till I find out
who gave away Ashkan, Shapoor
and the others to drag me through mud
and send those scums to our house
Don't pressure me
if I don't say, it means it was me
Yes! Talk or it was you!
Or the one beside you or behind you
all moles in the neighbourhood are here
We weren't born snitches
everybody had a first time
- Maybe it was the first time he snitched
- It wasn't!
The cops raid one place for a first-timer
tipoff not catching everybody in a few places
One of you with a long record
of snitching has done this shit!
Stop preaching!
It's not the first time they
raid the neighbourhood
You think you can do anything
you want? Untie us!
Shut your gob, mole!
I'll make you lay eggs here!
I wasn't like Hashem or my uncle
because I didn't want to
But I'll be more rabid
than a rabid dog if necessary!
So you'll stay here till you talk!
Mohammad
Afsaneh, why do you ask
so many questions?
No, with a friend
You take care too
Let them go or the cops
will tie you to a wheel!
I'm saying that for your own sake
We'll go to Europe with smugglers
in a month
Go to the end
- Will you get married in Europe?
- Yes, a girl with blue eyes
Blue?
What will you do if they film
your wife naked in a swimming pool?
They walk naked in the streets in Europe
I'll do nothing
Nothing?!
- What about in Kabul?
- What?
If they record her in Kabul?
You always smoke that
and make private jokes
What's that nonsense?
You'll kill us, Hojjat!
No sleep tonight!
Wake up!
Nobody sleeps here tonight!
Nobody sleeps here tonight!
- They won't talk if they're wise
- Why not?
Because either I'll kill him
or those who suffered because of him
or those he gave away
What if they don't talk?
I must find out who's got the film
I don't believe the snitching has nothing to
do with the recording in the swimming pool
You've boiled over!
You've become someone else!
Must talk to everybody in his own language
or they'll think you're dumb
You'll catch him and calm down
When I was a kid, I worked the whole
summer and bought a bike
It was my everything...
It was stolen
I couldn't find it
When I grew up
they hid stuff in my car
I went to jail for it for 5 years
My baby died before being born
I couldn't find out who the bastard was
Parvaneh had taken refuge to me
I couldn't look after her
If I can't do this one either
Parvaneh won't forgive me
Even if she does
I won't forgive myself
Coming!
- Hello
- Hello
- They're here?
- Yes, they're upstairs
Why did you join them?
Why you didn't stop them?
What the hell are you doing?
Shame on you!
Any idea what's the sentence
for what you're doing?
You want to save your brother
by ruining our life?
I swear to my father's life
if you don't let them go
I'll leave and never come back
Enough of getting along with you!
Back off!
If your wife hadn't begged
I'd go to the police directly
I'll do nothing only for Hashem's respect
- I he is mentally-ill take him to...
- Get out!
- Mohammad, stop it you idiot
- Mohammad, go in
- You come too
- You go and I'll stay
- No, you...
- I said Go! I'll stay here
Go, go Manijeh
You did what you wanted
Bye!
I'll show you!
Bye!
Take them home
- Everything's okay
- You made a shitty mess!
Your sister said I'm not helping her brother
so I gave her the address to know I am
- Yeah You told her!
- If, so
What are you saying that
I made a mess?
How could I know
she'd bring Afsaneh here?
- You call this okay?
- I'll make up for it
Run!
Stop, bastard!
- It kills?
- No, just makes them unconscious
Go, go!
Hit him!
Shoot him!
Stop, bastard!
Don't shoot!
Get in!
- Wake up!
- Don't!
That's the end!
Who snitched in the neighbourhood?
I'm sorry!
I'm fuckin' sorry!
Mr. Hojjat, I know who's snitched
Gol Agha back off...
My brother-in-law did it
I'm sorry!
I didn't want to speak for my wife's sake
Bastard!
Shit-bag!
Damn you
Damn him!
He's behind all our troubles
Mr. Hojjat I made a terrible mistake
I'll show you his place
- Get up
- Forgive me...
Mohammad, watch them
free them if he's told the truth
The gentlemen will forgive me, right?
Thank you, man, uncuff us
I lied to you
I don't have a brother-in-law
Mr Hojjat!
Mr Hojjat!
Mr Hojjat!
Your wife gave me money
She told me to give away
wherever you went
My wife gave you money?!
Your temporary wife
Shut up
Please, don't! I swear
I'm telling the truth
I'm telling the truth
She came to the stand one day
and said she is your temporary wife
She said she has your baby
but you don't get an ID for the baby
I followed her
so she wouldn't pilfer my money
I know her address
Let's go there
if I've lied, bury me there
What are you doing?
Are you blind?
I'm really sorry
The brake didn't work
sorry, little girl
Will you not call the police?
Why not?
Don't you see what you've done?
I don't have my documents now
and they'll impound my car
What is it?
Don't you see the accident?
- I'll pay all the costs
- How do I know how much it costs?
I am a body-worker
If you come to my garage
I'll fix it like new in an hour
I really apologise
sorry dear, I scared you
- Where is your garage?
- Very near
I can fix it in an hour without painting it
Okay, let's go I have no choice
I'm really sorry, follow me
Were you distracted
when you hit my car?
I was distracted by the money
you had to pay Akbar, the Kent
Who's Akbar, the Kent?
Why did you close the door?
How many Akbars have a big KENT sign
above their stand among snitches?
I don't know him open the door!
You don't know him?
Then why you paid him to follow me
and give away all places?
I don't know you
You have my child
but you don't know me?
Back off!
Open the door!
What are you doing?
Take anything you want
Don't play a fool or I'll set
your car on fire with you inside
- Answer me properly
- I don't know who you're talking about
Akbar, she says
she doesn't know you
She doesn't?
She's fuckin' wrong!
Sir, I don't know what you're saying
I'm nobody
You aren't, bitch? Who came to my stand
and put me in trouble?
Please, sir!
The kid's in the car
You're worried for her?
Get out, dear
Akbar! Take her out
You know what you've done answer me
correctly! You were getting close finding me
It was him!
Bring my daughter back
He told me to do it
He sent me to Akbar
he gave me money to pay Akbar
Go on
I did that for my reputation
I was in his house and he recorded me
He said if I didn't record that woman
in the swimming pool
he'd send my film to my family
You recorded Parvaneh?!
It was you?
I swear on my daughter's life
he forced me
I trusted him
he looked after me and my daughter
I didn't know he was a beast
he fooled me!
Who?
Give me a name!
Who was he?
Give a name! Who?
Who?
His name?
- Mosayeb
- What?!
Mosayeb
Which Mosayeb?
Mosayeb Gholami
You knocked down Hashem
now it's his friend's turn?
I knocked him down?!
I wish I could
I swear to my daughter's life
I didn't know what he wanted the film for
I wouldn't have done it if I had
I Swear to God I wouldn't!
I swear on my mother's soul
I'm telling the truth!
When I found out he'd posted the film
and what had happened
I was dying with a guilty conscience
Drink this, drink
Drink
- Call him
- He'll kill me
- Dial his number
- He'll kill me
Call him
Don't let him suspect anything
Put it on Speaker
The number you dialled is busy now
please try again later
Call him again
Yes?
Hello
How are you?
Say what you want, I'm busy
- Do you want me to call later?
- No, say it
You didn't call and I got worried
is it done?
Of course
I can do what ever I want!
Akbar the Kent destroyed his life!
Okay, thanks
- Anything else?
- Goodbye
Bye
If it wasn't for my daughter
I'd tell you to do anything you want to me
I beg you to let me go
for my daughter's sake
I'm sorry, I made a huge mistake...
He's been a vampire in my life for 3 years
with that film of mine
I won't let him use me any more
Please, sir!
For my daughter's sake, forgive me!
Give it back
The mobile
If you give him any hint
I'll do something you'll never forget
It's my biggest wish
he'll be out of my life
Akbar!
My sweetie!
Mr Hojjat, can I leave now?
I won't tell anybody you were behind
all this and you didn't see anything
Sure!
You're a real man!
I'm really sorry
- Don't do anything for money
- I won't
I'm so sorry!
Hello, Mosayeb
isn't it a bad time?
You're drunk?
Bon appetite!
Hashem called
he needs some things in there
I said I'd get them, but he said no
"Go with Mosayeb
he knows how to send them in"
We should go shopping together
Now, if that's okay with you
I'll pick you up
I'll be there in two hours
I'll come to the iron market
Bye
Yes, I got there
I'm at the backdoor
I'm so sorry to bother you
Okay, I'll wait
Tell Hashem
Mosayeb knocked him down
He'll tell you why if he isn't shy
You bastard must say it
You must suffer to death!
He can tell you better
Why? He hasn't been honourless like you
Why do you think he's been number 1
I number 2, all these years?
He's done everything to be at the top
and fix his position
To be at the top!
You did all these to replace Hashem?
What shit is his place?
Why should he give everybody hell?
What's the difference to be 1 or 10
in the neighbourhood?
Laugh! I'm going to pull out
your teeth one by one!
These things mattered to me once
Why me, who'd blocked streets
and fought as much as him
spent 100 times more than him
didn't have 1/100th of his awe?
But it was years ago
If it wasn't important to you
why did you such a thing to your friend?
Because he did worse to me
- Is there anything worse than you did?
- Yes, there is!
Why your brother did to me!
If I could, I'd do worse to him!
Nonsense!
If it was true, he'd suspect you a bit
Not trusting you like his brother
He didn't suspect me because he didn't know
I knew what he'd done to me
Whatever it was
the answer wasn't to do that to his wife
Your beastly brother saw himself
bigger than God!
But he had a weak point
his wife!
Shut up!
Parvaneh was his eyes
and I hit his eyes!
Shut up! Shut up!
What would you do if you realized
that your friend who was like your brother
sent some guys to take you to a garden
and rape you, so you wouldn't
go up and become bigger than him?
If you'd realized after 3 years that he
was behind all of it, what would you do?
The friend who untied
your naked body from the tree
and said it was a secret between us?
Then you found out
he'd done all that to prove to you that
if you aren't one of his men
you are a dead man
You're making up stories to save yourself
You were like his brother
why should he do such a thing to you?
He doesn't care about such things
He didn't even spare you
his flesh brother, fool!
Let me tell you something
that will kill you!
You thought he bought you
a lorry on instalment
just because he was your brother?
The stuff whose owner was never found
and you spent 5 years in jail for
It was Hashem and I!
Ten packs of opium
sealed with yellow tape!
In a red sofa under the other goods
You're sharp that you found me
I'm giving you the exact
signs so you surely believe
These were your exact signs?
Had you told anybody
about the colour of the sofa?
Had you told anybody
its leg was broken too?
Hashem said your baby
was miscarried for this
and your wife became barren
is that right?
Shut up
It's so funny you don't want to believe
what a jerk brother you have!
Thank God you were caught with opium
the last time and you're alive now
You carried ice for us 4 times
if you were caught, you'd be in a grave now
Shut up!
You were our servant
our carrier, our man!
You're giving your life for someone
who knew you'd be hanged
if you were caught with the ice
He said, "Hojjat's a fool so
there isn't fear in his eyes"
"And the cops don't pick on fools"
Fool! You lost your baby for our stuff!
If you tell him, he'll say
he has psychosis, yes, he does!
He wants to be number 1
to be at the top!
He didn't kill his wife
because of psychosis
He didn't want
to belittled for Parvaneh
If you'd heard him
the day we raided the swimming pool
you'd understand me now
Hojjat!
You went to Germany
and now you are talking shit
When you're talking about my friends
know who their boss is...
This neighbourhood has a boss
who doesn't give a shit about you
I care about my bros
and they care about me
Mosayeb is my brother, he supports me
and I support him
You aren't a thug
you're just a cheap copy of it!
I'd rip you apart if you were here!
Search well
My hands are tied
or I wouldn't have mercy on anybody
I'd give them hell
I'd search the whole neighbourhood with a
loader to find the bastard who took me down!
You can't judge people by their looks
Look well and find those
whose inside and outside are different
Be sure I will
I won't let any right to be trampled
I'll get to the end of it
You're a real man
Hashem
They give death penalty
for how much glass?
- Why do you ask?
- Tell me
- Don't do anything stupid and ruin us
- What can we do?
You tell me what to do
I must pay them all
to change your sentence
Don't do it!
They'll hang you!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Time to say goodbye!
Quiet, pretty boy!
I'll do anything to get you out
You know someone?
I'll find one
Don't buy from these kids
they'll give you away later
You know people?
I'll connect you
But don't get more than 3 kilos
its sentence is hanging
- Don't scare me
- You're done if you're afraid
They'll catch you
You mustn't think you're carrying stuff
be a fool!
The cops don't pick on fools
- Leave, sir
- Okay!
- Leave, sir
- Okay!
I promise I'll return
and make everything right again
Let's see what you do
Give me water, I'm thirsty
How much will you pay me to let you go?
And keep quiet about what you've done
so you can live happily ever after?
Whatever you say
my cheque book is in my bag
Water!
Hojjat
Give me water!
Date it today
Abbas said to say hello to Hashem
This cheque's dated today
payable to bearer
It's this?
- It's correct?
- The 3.5 kg Abbas said
Thank you
Okay, I'm coming!
Why are you having only rice?
Have chicken!
Mother
As long as Hashem was outside, he was
careful his friends wouldn't use drugs
Poor Mosayeb!
What a world!
Someone is getting married
and someone is getting ruined
Good for Mosayeb's father!
He didn't see his son like this
God is the best judge
Lord! We are incapable
Grant us whatever is good for us!
What's the matter?
Why don't you eat?
I will
Why have you gone dumb?
You've found out something?
We went to Mr Ahmad's house again
yesterday, crying and begging
He said the same "I'll have him
hanged if you don't find him"
What's wrong, son?
Just this bastard...
He wasn't found
Mohammad knows I did
everything I could
But it didn't happen
I'm sorry
Have your dinner
Eat, mom
Eat, dad
Everybody's fate is in his own hand
Eat, mom
Eat
Prosubtitling
