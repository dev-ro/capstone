I loved sophisticated pictures

It's not against you, sorry

had started so well;
the mood was good,
the dj excellent
pleasant temperature,
superb girls,
alcohol a gogo,
drugs of quality,
undeniably, my first 33 years
were really successfull
but I won't disguise the truth
I'm not a nice boy

company of the world
median age: 28 years old

my open ended job
is copywriter
I write 30 seconds
film scenarios
and slogans for posters
I say "slogan"
for you to understand

know we say
"catcher" or "headline"
for example: Wonderbra

ohhh, nevermind...
It's Marc Maronnier,
my creative director
after Philippe, the president,
he is the most important
man of the company
- hi
- hi, how are you?
- I just spent the week-end
with my man
four days in Cabourg
I'm so happy!
- oh yeah?!
- ... A charming little corner
so romantic,
we landed up there,
we digged it so much...
it was great,
I'm so peachy!
- you're fired, take your stuff
right now and beat it!
I am not joking
Marc is like that, for 10 years
he has taught me everything
Allright you stay,
and your out of date language
"we digged it, it was awesome,
we got a kick out "
avoïd that, when
i'm plunged into a file
it's disgusting me
and you spend this week-end here,
I want a balance for Tuesday
- Yes Mr Maronnier
- Ok, it's cool, you
can call me Marc
- he is a genius
- you're ok?
you're ready for this afternoon
presentation for Madone?
- yeah, we hold something
- I won't be there
Jeff will be
- wait, jeff...
- that's the way it is!
I rely on you?
- yeah, so, I rely on myself...
- you adore me?!
creative is not such an easy job,
and that's also why we're so well-paid
to shut us up, you won't
believe me, but
money is not the only reason
I choose that job
I was 17 and a half
when I had my first "ad-shock"
I knew it was what
I wanted to do
I went to the ciné, ads were
sometimes better than the film
Some of its were little
treasure of ingenuity
This day I decided
to become publicist
and I succeeded
Here, at 14th floor
is my office
near the radiator,
it's Cuddly
a blond hamster, picked up
on a filming shoot
and next to it,
this retarded teenager,
he's my Charly
he's mine
he's my partner
he is artistic director, my D.A.
or A.D., "Art Director"
As we say in the profession,
because it makes more like American
Hello Thierry, it's Charly,
Hello, sorry to disturb you,
I'm embarrassed with an email
I received, the one with the eel...
the moray eel... sorry
I don't see, it's a guy or
a wench it's fucking with?
I thought it was a guy...
it's bad...
oh, you're working now...
As every creative of every company
of the world, my Charly spend 89%
of his working time sharing
trash pictures via internet
there, he comes out of a great
"Japanese vomit eater" period
- Charly
- Yes Octave
- If I told you, I have the vague feeling
to blow a fuse towards myself
what would you say?
- Wait, wait, are you telling
me this here?
- Yeah I tell you
- Ok then, tell me,
I am listening to you
- I simply have the vague feeling
to blow a fuse towards myself
yeah, of course
- allright, I understand you completly,
I'd like to tell you many things
- So come on, come on...
- Did you snort, with someone else?
- No I would never do this to you
- So this is me you...
you are provocating me!
- I said nothing, stop, stop
Oh yeah insult me in Deutsh
come on, punish me!
- Guys, we're waiting for you, on the stage,
for the shooting in Boulogne...
- Yeah, we're coming, we finish, we go...
- A masterpiece!
- Someone told Steven it's
an ad for sauerkraut?
- Don't know, I really have a doubt
- please go and see him!
- no you!
- no you!
you it's good...
- what a bitch that guy
- like that, yes. You detest me,
despise me with your mouth...
- Steve... Can I talk to you
just 2 seconds...
sorry
It's super good, super glamour,
super sensual...
but just could you
square me a plan
cause, i have more options
to make it more classical,
more neutral, you see,
it's not Aubade...
it's sauerkraut...
- Sauerkraut, it's what you want?
- No, but it's good!
- Turn on the radio!
move, come on move!
there...
Who's that?
- ooh, it's Jeff
- hi guys, all is right?
- Be careful, you got a
dropping piece of fabric
- Sorry I don't feel like kidding
You're ready for "Starlight"?
- that's it!
- that's it, I told you earlier
- No it's me, I told you
- Ok ok allright,
I don't want to put
pressure on you,
but currently it's super hot
with Madone...
- Yeah, Starlight is yet in linear...
What!? I'll call her back...
You don't seem to realize
tought it's normal...
You're artists
but Madone it's 39%
of the Ross sales, so...
fuck! I gonna spit
on your mug!
I told you, I'll see
that later...
Jeff always own
the new rubbish gadget
for example, his telephone
is built in his earphone
the whole stuff permanently
linked to his secretary
- this bitch bugs me,
here it's my cellphone
with that I'm permanently linked to her,
so I always know everything
It's very expensive
and it drives mad
What I was saying?
It Stinks sauerkraut
of shit here, no?
- Jeff, let me introduce you to
Sir who produces that sauerkraut.
- oh yes, Jean-pierre Rannu:
Jean-françois Marolle,
Jean-françois Marolle:
Jean-Pierre Rannu
- Sir Rannu, really,
I'm deeply sorry, but...
you know, we have so much stress
with this job, we need to relax...
- Forget it,
that's the floor manager...
- Beat it!
What Jeff doesn't say,
that it's the 12th
the 15th he will receive the evaluation
report of his work filled by his customer
That's to say by Madone
a sort of school report
notebook for adult
so he freaks out, normal
it's meant for it
but it doesn't matter
that's cool,
moreover at the Ross everything
is cool... Even the sauerkraut
the Madone executive
would dig to be... cool
not easy to tumble in
schizophrenic land
when your name is Jean Christian Gagnant
and got initials engraved on your briefcase
for example, to him this morning
must have been a nightmare
In Madone every product manager
wear short-sleeved shirts...
- Have you received
my confirmation e-mail?
...and neckties with
little animals on it
You have received
my confirmation mail?
To a product manager,
looking cool is hyper important
we shall never forget
a customer has no ideas
and that's why he comes
to our advertising company
- that don't fit,
fuck, fuck and fuck!
fuuuuuuuck!
in those days, giant pictures
were put on the walls,
on bus stops,
on trucks, on taxis
human eye had never been so much
solicited since its whole history
between birth and 18 years old,
we had calculated that each person
had been exposed to an
average of 350.000 ads
It had required 2.000 years
to come to it
- Gas Parengo
- Hello sir
- Charles Nagou, we come
for the Starlight meeting
- Allright you have an ID card?
- yes
- thanks
- We leave you the helmets
- Here are your badges,
1st floor, Veneziano room
- thanks
- You have some left
Always coming late to meetings,
a creative on time is not credible
Entering the room, where everybody's
waiting for him for 45 minutes,
he should by no means apologise
upon reflexion, it's true
this afternoon meeting
was even more important than an
interview with the head of the state
This meeting changed my life
I think originally, I wanted
to make good around me
It has not been possible,
for two reasons
because I've been prevented, and also
a bit because I have abdicated
- We're passing through a deep crisis
in the yoghurt world
you knows only too well,
since the mad-cow disease case,
yoghurt is world-threaten
in this eroding market, our
answer is the "Foodament"
the "Foodament" is a food
which would also be a medicament
and then, Starlight innovate and
focus on a white cheese's new vision
the "bodymading"
with Starlight, I eat smart, so I am
smart, so Starlight makes me smart
it's when we catch them
It's a bit "head to legs"
The Guy that don't laught
to Jeff's "no-joke"
is the one to be convinced,
Alfred Dulère, 51 yo,
scorpio ascendant ram,
director of marketing
at Madone fresh food division
suit: Hugo Boss, perfume: Hugo Boss
favorite poet: Hugo Boss
Doesn't touch his wife anymore
since 1993, vote Republican,
adore karting. At Madone and At Ross
he is feared and dread
- Yes, next
- Here why in this perspective...
of "bodymading"
Octave and Charly have worked
for several weeks
I hand over to Octave...
- Sorry, I don't know what happened,
I thought the meeting would
take place at the company
You have received
my confirmation e-mail?
- Gagnant, sit down
- Octave and Charly,
we're listening to you
- Right, before begining, I'd like
to dedicate this film to Tatiana
I've met her in disco, two
years ago, in Saint Barth'
thanks for her
- Please, a bit of concentration
Always begining by lightening
the atmosphere with a shitty joke
Drug helps you to gain
this nonchalance
this needed detachment to
survive that kind of meeting
We all want to change the world,
and in taking part in these meetings
I'm aware of collaborating
being sit down at this table
is taking part in deadening people's mind
To succeed, it needed
a sacrifice
but I was doubting of
being someday able of it
- Octave, you're high
Octave, you're high
- Yes... sorry
- He's on drugs
- A discovery?
- We're on a beach
- Yes, so, heavenly beach,
coco palms, turquoise sea,
white sand, the Eden
- Two women,
- Two bombs
- Of course
are running
on the sand
long focal length on
the young women
Pamela takes the floor
" Infact I consider the exegis of our
mastitis are facing criplling hermeneutics
Christina answers
Be carefull, Pamela, You're slowly
slipping to an ontological paronomasis
- Not at all, it's just
an allegorical solipsism,
nothing to do with it...
Just look
she bend over the equation
- I have made an equation
for you to understand
if we accept the hypothesis
X cube root
varies according to the infinite
- Ah ok
- You just have to
subdivide the set
which will tend
to the asymptote
exactly, it's good,
I've understood!
They leave laughting
Packshot: "Starlight to remain slim
except in your head"
- it's good?
- Absolutely
- Now I ask a question;
Why make humor?
- Yes, infact we though
it would be interesting...
- No, no, no, I say:
Why make humor?
- Because humour make
the brand friendly,
excellent for the
product memorization
customers remember easier,
what makes'em laugh
- Day after, people at office
recall the joke... at dinners
- No, no, no, why?
- For it, for you, think about comedies
that succeed, people going to the cine
They sometimes like
to have fun, people... No?
- Yes, except they don't
eat the reel after
Alfred Dulère is a big asshole
come on Octave open your mouth,
once and for all, and shove off
" listen to me carrefully dumb shit,
when you go to the dentist,
you don't tell him how to do
you rely on him
Here it's the same:
You rely on us!
- So, you have something else?
We're off our rocker,
stop to shoot up, guys
Who do we sell the
yoghurt to, fuck?!
- The housewife
- The housewife, it's what?
you need to go out, guys!
the housewife is a tired good fellow,
she is in her suburb supermarket
her kids are bitching
in the caddie
her hands are full of shit,
she's blown-out
she has all a bunch of problems,
her husband boozes,
She doesn't feel like having an headache
with ironic references... nobody knows!
So, before thinking about your
4 friends in Paris you'll make laugh
I'm also a part of, time to time,
it makes me laugh your bullshits
Before that, you should ask yourself,
"what she wants to see our housewife?
what she wants to hear?
what does she want us to tell her?"
there, that's all!
that's the question
you should stop lying
to yourself, now...
- Really nice your
view of the world!
- Me, guys, I have 12.000 tons
of yoghurt to sell off this year,
so youth: ok
sexy: ok
and...?
and dream!
What the fuck, we are
dreams sellers!
yesterday, I went to see my goddaughter,
she had her dance show,
decors were painted by children...
I took off
I took off
My proper joint, Charly
So, I was wondering, dance, would there
be something to find around dance?
yoghurt, lightness, feminity,
... A danser wearing tutu?
no?
- yes
- no, no, we will find,
we will... huh guys
- still with your style,
humor, glamour,...
Now you know, you know why you're
watching ads of shit for some years
It's here, at this moment
that everything's tied up
creatives don't lack of ideas, behind
every shitty ad there's a good idea
thrown-up in the bin, just because everyone,
me included, shit on his pants
- Excuse-me
- You allright?
- no, no because I leave the Ross
I leave that pigsty
I stop working,
I get the system out,
I stop it all, I piss you off,
I despise you all
I give you my card back
of course it's not a resignation
it's a layoff, of course
you fire me, classic stuff;
indemnities, cash, golden parachute
big money, ok!?
- What happens to you Octave?
You've recently changed of drug?
- no, no
- ah, I see, you're writing a script
on a guy who drives on depression
ok, no it's good but it lakes of some...
no it's funny, you're still funny,
but I don't know, the guy...
...could loose everything,
he could become a shit
think about it
Octave I adore you,
you know it
YOU
Sophie has worked
at the Ross for 3 years,
she is a part-time planning
manager, Marc hired her
He has always
got good taste
No, no don't insist
make love in an elevator
with an intern, it's...
far too, "adrenalin" to me
even if I feel you're hot as hell
it's out of question!
negative!
I got a reputation to preserve,
you understand?
Here it's more in the mood,
dirty parking, shabby lights,
very Mike Lee...
we fancy it at this time
piss smell, the real one
What you will do, Sophie?
You'll take your lil'scooter in the rain
you'll regain your lil' husband,
watch the saturday night show?
That's it, the happiness
he offers you... That's it?
- I'm alone and I don't have TV
- ok, wait, wait, I know I am a
superficial and arrogant shit
ok I don't deny
But I like you, you understand?
your hair, your eyebrows,
your small intestine please me
even your rebuffs please me
- If my rebuffs please you...
- nobody, nobody
never please me
I'm sure if you let yourself being kissed,
it could be relavely... pleasant
It's really what I thought,
you're really a beautiful slut
- Wear it, wear it, so I can kiss
myself a little
Everything's allright,
everything's allright!
Hi, it's Sophie, leave me a message,
and I may call you back
Since Sophie left you,
you turn around your flat,
you no more
open your curtain,
You only use one
room out of nine
the microwaves rythm
your week-ends
you order your
ready-meals by phone
since you're living alone,
you fuck a lot of video-tapes
you always have pieces of kleenex
taped at your fingertips
Being without Sophie
made you ugly
Not only drugs cause
withdrawal
It was easier to have a single
retarded behaviour
when you knew Sophie
was lovely waiting for you
Since Sophie left you
nothing go round
when It was yet?
- it's going allright,
thanks a lot!
- stop it...
you've finished to eat?
- I can't with it... Like that I can,
with my hand
- I see that
- With that, I can't,
or otherwise if I sting
you see, if I sting...
- So you've finished now?
- yes
- So, I got a little
gift for you
Happy St. Valentine Day
Ah yeah, it was that day
- you're unfair, plus
we said no gifts
- But here, it's a litlle
bit more than that
- What, sorry?
lot more than that?
- Lot more...
- so, it's a surprise
I open it
It won't blow me in the...
here I go
It smells like pee-pee a bit
- It's a pregnancy test
positive
I'm pregnant by you
- Holy cow! It was hard
I spilled all my guts,
everything that every man
of the world says to their
pregnant girl, in those moments
- Sir, Madame
Have you finished?
- Yes it's over
- You don't want
a little dessert?
Sophie never told anyone
she was pregnant
except to you
Moreover, at the Ross, nobody
knew you were together
What is she doing?
Who is she phoning to?
Where is she when
she's not here?
Marc and Sophie, didn't fit together,
but they were well together
Which is lot more rare
They go to a full
of stars hotel,
three times per week,
at about 14h15
In order to have sex in
a clean and a central place
ouch, you're hurt
- Guys, fun's over, joke's over,
good mood's over, all it's game over
I am not joking here!
Dulère just phone me, he never
talked to me that way!
listen to me!
if we don't have a
new concrete script
before 14 o'clock,
we're all dead!
I tell you, in one hour,
we're all on the dole!
- It's hardly depressing in here,
it looks like 3 Ross' employees...
- President, it so kind to come
to see the small workers
- Hi youngsters!
- Tell me, Jeff, we've been phoned
by Dulère: it's not right
- Jean-François, what stage
are you at with Madone?
- Precisely, we're in
the middle of a meeting
we're on a lot more
federative concept
we're at that stage
- Oh, really, we're
at that stage?
- We got your green
light, Marc?
- it's swotting? uh?
- it's swotting hard!
hey that's good...
- Hey Cuddly is not punchy...
- Stop with it, you idiot,
you gonna kill it,
stop doing that, it gonna
choke, I tell you
- Hey, we should already
be shooting, now!
and your bullshit!
Fuck, we are done now!
We loose Madone,
it's direct layoff...
But you don't give a fuck,
anyway, you'll always find a job
at least, move your ass
for the others!
i don't even
talk about me
anyway, I know you despise me,
you don't like me,
I'm just a little shitty
salesman, that's it?
Think about low wages,
small posts, they will pay the price
Jacqueline, at the accountancy,
with her handicapped kid
45 yo, you think
she will find a job?
She can still dream on!
...and Momo who clean your shit up
every evening, your coke, your porn mags
He also can still dream on!
Be humans, fuck!
of course, it feels weird to him,
realising he will shortly be homeless
J.- F. Marolle has been programmed
for a streetless existence
He has accepted to be insulted
and humiliated, during 15 years,
by his employers and his customers,
to be able to borrow money from Bank
in order to acquire a 3 rooms
in Levalois-Perret.
- that's fine, come on
we go, uh?
- ok
- come on, it's good, stand up
He freaks out so much, he would
almost become touching
- So... The last-minute dung, ok?
- absolutely
- The dung...
- A charming woman,
- neither too old,
nor too young
- neither blonde nor dark
- chestnut?
- dark
- ... Performs small dance steps,
wearing a tutu
- ah no, no, no, a Vanna
White's little shirt
- I take
She is on a beautiful
seaside house's terrace
decorated like in...
- "Friends"
- warm without being flashy
she looks at the camera,
she exclaims with a voice...
- suave but authentical...
- I'm pretty isn't it?
no, I'm told I'm pretty...
I'm said to be pretty,
- but I don't ask myself the question
- I'm quite simply myself!
She grabs a Starlight pot
she delicately opens
- Neither too fast nor to slow,
- before enjoying a spoonfull
- she closes her eyes with pleasure,
while enjoying the product
- that's good, hu
- in passing, 2 seconds 
plan, at least...
- minimum, uh...
- then, she looks straight
to the camera:
"My secret it's...
- Starlight!
scuse me...
- Starlight...
- So there you put
the product demo...
with 6 white cheeses, fat-free,
with calcium, vitamins, proteins,
to be healthy in head and body
there's nothing better...
- They will adore...
- She resumes;
Here is my secret,
- but it's no more,
since I told you all!
- impish laugh,
- not too much...
- packshot, "Starlight to stay slim
except head inside "
- It's awesome;
guys you blew me away!
- it's in your email
- Dulère gonna shit on
his pants, when he'll see this
- You have no self-esteem,
I despise you, bite it
- They gonna go mad!
- Run away!
- Uh Charly, we gonna bugger
Madone once again...
What?! yeah
I'm coming, bitch...
- Go check your emails out
you're idiot,
she's dead
- I'm daddy,
she's pregnant!
- it's not true!
It's working, it's true?
- You never thought being model?
- rather comedian, it's my dream
I do lots of castings, but
there are too many girls
I heard I'm too "exotic"
- If someday I hear of stuff, you'd like
me to pull the strings for you?
you know, I'm an
important person
- I'll make you 10%
on your blow jobs
That's true, to a professionnal like Tamara,
Octave is a puzzling customer,
he asks her to wear Obsession,
a Sophie's perfume
She appeases him
Tamara is the call-girl
he doesn't fuck
- Come on
wait wait ola, softly,
light, light, cruising,
respect yourself
you got beautiful hair
- that's additions
- You got beautiful eyes
- that's lenses
- You got a beautiful breast
- It's a wonderbra
- You got beautiful legs
- aah, at last a compliment!
- stop!
Why are you whoring?
You're unhappy?
- I'm never unhappy
When I do...
- To me it's the opposite, I call you
not to be unhappy
it's beautiful
- You think some day
we'll make love?
- Call me back, Sophie,
I regret
Octave it's Jeff, I hope you
had my messages on your cellphone,
anyway your voicemail is full,
anyway, I wanted to tell you
I made Tamara comes,
the actress you told me about

can call me back that would be nice
IT'S THE FIRST AND LAST TIME

I hope you don't have
personnal worries
Octave, It's Jeff again, call me

I pass at the office back, I try
to call you on your cellphone
So, Octave, I've called all Paris clubs,
you're not under the tables
You would be nice to call me back,
I hope you have no worries...

All here don't exist!
Look at yourselves,

clean around, it doesn't exist,
nobody, blotch hiself like that,

What sort of match? Foot,

Numbers of birds in here, it's crazy!
What's your alimentation like?
- A beautiful chocolate bar,
filled with good milk moss
for your growth
- Could you turn that
music off, it's a pain...
- You're walking on crosses,
This orange juice is fake,
this plate is glued, look,
there's a technician here, look
there are cameras everywhere!
look! look, go away...
ah yeah, look!

we'll tumble down!
- Hello girls,
- Hello Jeff
Here, at the Ross and Witchcraft,
the customer is always right
and the customer is you
Stéphanie, give me the call!
Yes, Jean-Christian,
how is the little family?
you'll always have
the last word
yes, I read your proposition,
It's really a great idea!
ah yes, it's terrific,
really, good bye!
See you wednesday!
Even if it's not your job,
we'll make you feel important
You won't come to us
by any chance
the World is a concept
and your concept we'll be ours
- It feels good
for my anus, I use R&W, "smell and flavour",
thereby, with one touch
I keep my anus and my breath fresh...
- It's charming... relax, try to
quiet down, it's gonna be allright
try to appease yourself,
I'm here, I'll be just behind
the ambulance...
- He's gonna die!
- it's ok, it's ok,
- He's gonna die!
- Go away, go away!
- Let him breath!
Here we go
- Prepare me some adrenalin,
- block, block
- Charge
- We're loosing him
Octave is back from the dead
To him, life without cocaïne
is nearly a discover
It's a bit like a life
without Tv to others
Everything is slower,
and it quickly gets bored
He tells himself, maybe that's the secret
that would save the world:
accepting boredom
...Not easy...
Jeff never hold a grudge
towards him for the punch
finally, he's nice Jeff
- He looks fine, uh?
- not so much
- yes, he looks fine
Octave and Jeff could die together
it would be good for society
- Octave, you're ok?
You look really well today
it's a pleasure
- it's a pleasure to see you
I have something to tell you
- well, we'll talk in the car
- I take your bag
- him, the Octave's new friend
it's Pyjaman
Marc Maronnier is dead,
Octave and the other humans
from the agency were
shocked by Marc's Suicide
but to say his gesture
surprised them, would be a lie
- I was feeling it comes
- I didn't expected it at all
- I expected it, to speak positive things,
at Madone they are 100%...
At the agency upon Starlight,
everything's going as expected
the train of mediocrity,
hasn't run a minute late
rather, It has even got ahead;
page setting of the dung
presenting at Madone
appreciating at 200%
buying of even more
broadcasting spaces
congratulating
traiting genius
- Sophie, you have news?
- Precisely,
- She went away to Canada,
she has resigned
Marc were fired,
at the agency seminary,
on the beach, on sunset
he shot a bullet in his head
In advertising, when oneself join up
with spacetime's Matrix
there are no articles in the papers,
no half-mast posters,
no souvenir show,
only remains unsold stock options
when a publicist join up god,
he's replaced with an alive publicist
Marc, I'll avenge you
- watch out, it's fragile...
Arriving at the PPM,
PPM it means, in american,
Pre production Meeting
It's to say the last meeting where every
details are decided before the shooting
the meeting syndrome at the top
the one who's just 34 yo, and who
already speaks to herself
it's Fabienne, the tvprod
single under prozac,
she always do her best
it's tiring her enormously,
but so are we,
- Right, before starting that meeting,
I'd like us to have a touched thought
for Marc Maronnier, who left us
tragically some days ago
a though for the great professional
he was, but above all for the man
concerning the Jean Christian's
confirmation mail, shooting list precisions
It was phone contacts for the
shooting, everybody agree with it?
- It must be a yoghurt in the life
moreover, the laptop on the table idea
for the packshot it's perfect, it's modern
It makes it cash...
Giovanni what does he think about it?
- Giovanni M. Dulère
Him, it's Giovanni Del Toro, he has
been chosen cause he is very pro
translate: he lay down face to the agency
- If everybody agree, we can
proceed to casting now, Charly...
Now at this moment, Customer
must choose the human being
who will better embody his product,
it's always a bit sensitive point
- There are our 2 choices
for the Starlight woman
Jennifer you can reach at 88-60-90
We love her, she is fresh,
she is modern
- What's that mess?
what's that black?
Jeff, restrain your guys, cause
we're again starting whatever off
scuse me, I'm not racist, but no...
at a pinch, the day we bring
a Starlight Chocolate out
why not, but here it's not my fault,
if our youghurt is white
Blacks it's too much segmenting
- it produces too much anxiety
- I'm ok to be open-minded,
but there are limits
- So we reach too much africanity,
not enought francity, we agree?
- too much africanity, not enought...
- africanity not enought francity,
- There, it's better, that's better,
it's even really good,
she is really good that Tarama...
- Tamara
- Yes, Trama...
- Superb, she's totally
in the brand values
- it's Madone proper picture
it's superb
- it's different?
- it's different,
Excuse me, she looks less
prostitute than the previous one
- that's right
- it's completely Starlight
- that's no more and no less than
Jennifer Lopez, more junior, more trendy
- It wouldn't be still
too much africanicity?
- You can brighten her face
a little, in post-prod?
- Completely, we'll rework the tone,
during the calibration, no problem
- Ok Bingo!
That's her
- So, we optionalize it
The meeting lasted 7 hours,
7 hours of jerk-off
with some piece of bravery...
- Gagnant, anything else?
- Eh, yes, important,
- I'd like us to validate the
green density of the lawn, now
Well in brief, it's bootlickin'
it's titillating, it's nit-picking
it's diddling at night,
as usually,
and during hours...
- up, up, down,
right, right, up, up, up,...
It looks like if it were nothing,
that small meeting, to you,
completely surrealist and entertaining
and yet...
- It's not for you, there will
be chocolate, after and before
- not a custard tart!
- it will be after
- Chocolate mousse!
- Stop it kids, stop it,
that's enough kids!
Pay cheaper, cheaper,
it's cheaper for you
- Validated, perfect!
- I think we're totally focused, here
- 7 hours meeting, I think we did a good job
- I personally really enjoyed myself,
- good, there will be fewer
- really, really good meeting, Corinne,
I like a lot your work
- No but my name is Fabienne,
- Welcome at the Ross
- I'm working here for 5 years
- Look at this! Octave is
already set to go to Miami
He has yet his little bag,
bloody Octave!
- Tamara it's really good, honestly,
come on spit!
there, softly...
- Still respect yourself...
it's really good,
but just a little bit
greedier, please,
offer us it, give it to me, greedier,
think about closing your eyes
when swallowing, ok?
- yes,
- One has to feel the
pleasure in your throat
come on, act it for me,
right, cloose you eyes
while swallowing
you take your time,
that was good
what you did in the end
really good, more smiley
at the end than at the start
that's the product benefit, that make
you fresh, happy and blooming, ok?
We're here, we rule,
of course you keep, interior,
but you give to the other, you rule,
you take, without never...
because otherwise we are...
but, rise the product up
there, mysterious, that's right
look at the product, look at us
and offer Starlight!
there that's it!
we do it again
- it's really...
- It's good?
- Huge, nothing to do...
don't you think?
- superb
It was the last take of the day,
and the more important for an ad film;
the packshot
hours of lighting, each minor details
matters, yoghurt choice, the spoon,
In fact the jerk-off Everest
- Best thing is to do a balled up
on Starlight, I think...
- It's really well done!
- All right
- No that's shit and you know it,
you see the two fuckers, there?
- I've always known we
could count on him
- I want make them cry,
after the take,
you hang on the chief
cameraman for 10 minutes
we'll shoot our version
a stuff never done before
a commando operation
- With what he put in his turbinate bone,
he won't go far...
- It's an artist, it works
like that artists,
simple customer,
we'll find another one
Octave I wanted to tell you
how much you impressed me
Thank you, Octave, thank you
for your involvement
I know this script wasn't
your favourite...
You played the game
as a great professional
Obviously, Alfred Dulère
is a bick prick even abroad
- See you soon,
- See you very soon
- So, we've got a plane to take
- Yes, didn't you want
to salute Tamara?
- oh, yes Tamara... yes,
Gagnant! I leave you my house keys
details Diana, details!
- Buddy come see, you're ready?
- yes
- You're ready?
- Yes
- Wait, wait, They propose us
the creative director post
250.000 F per month, plus expense claims,
paid apartment, company porsches
company bitches, stock options,
well there, coke that's the Everest
- No
- But yes, you must say yes!
- No, no, no
- Why?
- Because I got more turn-on,
more revolutionary
- That's what?
- After...
- We shot the pack
no, skip it, this movie is shit
- But it's important, the packshot!
- After Fabienne, after
US
Wa have succeeded
Our version was in the can,
we were kings, we were the strongest
Here it is, I was cameback
- That's weird, that stuff
don't go forth anymore
- Try again
- May I serve you something?
Tea, coffee?
Madam, sir, would you like a drink?
I stayed cloistered at home,
crying and systematicly stumbling
upon Sophie's answerphone
In the meantime, Charly, that fuckhead,
had already answered for us both,
I just had to sign the papers
visually, Creative Director
initials, it makes D.C.
Young blood at R.&W.
- ahh, you're no dorks!
You could have smiled a bit more,
but you are no dorks!
It's in the whole Ross' Name, I raise
my glass to our new two Creative Directors:
Octave and Charly
Yes Stephanie, wait, speak louder...
- Come on,
- What the cops!?
- have a drink
- Well, ok, let them come up, yeah
Police wants to see you,
They're coming up
- Hello,
- Hello Octave, Mrs and Mr. Lacase
on the phone, Sophie's parents
- Oh hi, how are you?
- Inspector Parretti, we come for
Octave Parengo and Charly
- We heard your messages,
on Sophie's mobile phone
and we don't well understand
our daughter commited suicide,
Octave
- Wanted for murder
- it's because of you,
She commited suicide in Senegal
with her friend, Marc,
you understand?
She fired a gun's bullet in her face, Octave
- I understand
- It's better, I can
eventually call you back?
cause I'm here at
a meeting now,
I can't really answer you,
I call you back on Tuesday
ok? kisses...
- Octave you're fired!
- Now it's too late, it had to be
done earlier, I'm sorry...
- This boy is a real shit
- what are you doing here?
- I quit my life, by myself!
- Get him! he's buggering off!
- Wait, it's ok, it's ok
- Get him!
- it's allright
- I've an idea, I gonna...
- You stay here!
- It's locked!
- Tamara, Alfred,
Alfred Dulère,
Tell-me, would you fancy
a small dinner at the silver tower,
one of these evenings?
And I have a little surprise for you
- Put your gun away
- Parengo don't mess up!
Come back Parengo!
don't do it, I tell you!
Give me your hand,
stop that!
everything is temporary:
Love, Art, planet Earth
you, me
particulary me.
PROJECTION TEST
You're part of a pre-test panel
Option END n°2
- Octave, fuck, I am in a mid-bad,
enormous... I'm not fine at all
- Yes good evening, do you want
champagne? Amuse la bouche?
- Thanks madam,
- I didn't come here to croak with you,
There's a little girl waiting for me
in Marocco, all I do is for her
- What's that?
- Vomit, you both swallowed
this shit together
- You puked on yourselves
- Fuck, Octave, I believed
we had killed people
I believed we were pursued by the cops,
I was too scared, no joke...
- Me too,
- Come here
At this instant, we were beautiful inside
but pitiful outside...
- Stop laughing, fuck!
Deep inside us, very deeply,
it was a new birth
The universe was offering
us a second chance
- Thank you
- And there are your baggages...
- No, that's fine, I'll take it,
thank you
Dulère had to be blast,
then disapear, very quickly
To help me realeasing the commercial,
I connected the AAF guys,
the Anti-Ads Front, a secret activist
small group, Charly dug out on internet
- You behave, exactely like them, here...
Watch out seb...
- Like them, Why?
- Excuse me to tell you that, but you
do verbal marketing here
- Wait, I'm doing verbal marketing?!
You know what you're sayin here?
- A terrorist attack should be tried
Like Hud, he had got a good job,
at the Channel 1 Ad section
it's him who has broadcasted
the film on live...
Here it is, Octave is dead,
and so is his car
But I couldn't leave this world,
without savouring my victory
- Excuse me president...
Yes? Well, ok, of course...
you can turn on the
television on first channel?
- My pleasure, mister
- it's good, we're watching
- Here it is, thank you,
it will be awesome,
director!
We'll rip it up!
Tests are super positives,
I think we can say it,
- Yes my dear
- Finally, They're friendly,
and we live strong things
- Look my dear, I think
it's going to begin
- Sorry; I feel stupid, I'll do it again
- Hello, here it's Starlight
a new diet yoghurt, that's strictly
without any relevance
So why are we trying
to sell it to you?
because we've got goals,
we have numbers to make
What did you think?
You think we're having fun, here?
- You know how much costs
30 sec of peoples brain
who's watching tv at this hour?
400.000 F
So how do we do?
With what do we pay this?
and our executives,
how do we pay them?
Wait, our CEO for example,
which salary is nearly closed
Burkina Faso PIB, eh?
What do we pay him with?
Where do we find the cash?
And our shareholders?
the investors?
How we do? How we do?
How we do?
- Fuck that's disgusting!
So now, turn your lil'tv off,
take your lil'coin holder,
and go directly to the
supermarket to sell off stocks,
12.000 tons are to gobble up!
Madone, buy it, otherwise
it won't sell up
Who is slim in his head?
- Anyway, we can't say you give
your customers shit...
I was savouring my revolution,
I was disappearing... Far
learn to live differently
My friend Pyjaman told
me about the jungle
Each year, the world-wide budget
spent on advertising
arise 500 billion dollars.
An UN study estimate that
only 10% of that ammount
