Good evening. l invite you to
our lmages program.
Today's topic is Pakistan
and terrorism..
Even clearly known from
the evidences..
..that Pakistan is involved
in the November 26 Mumbai blast..
..they objected to it totally.
Usually there is a talk that Pakistan..
..will accept the matters very late.
So, what is the stand of Pakistan
on the issue of terrorism?
-A fiction program.
-How many Kg?
-3 kg!
-One day before the disaster happened..
..in America on September 1 1th,

The president of America on hot line.

..from Pakistan on the hot line.
Oh, Mush! What's the matter?
l feel very much sorry about
the disaster for your nation.
What happened?
Thousands of people died.
Many buildings were collapsed!
Pakistan also will participate
in your sorrow..
The terrorism should be
uprooted any cost.
Even spend millions
to eradicate the terrorism.
With the financial assistance got from
from World Bank, Pakistan
should take revenge for
that happened on 9/1 1
9/1 1? What are you blabbering?

2 constables are enough for him
Protection is not for him. But for CM

Hello
Mr. Marar! Who is going

Mr. Edward is coming.
Till then you can talk to me
l will negotiate only with the one
who can take all the decisions..
l think l already told that to you..
Don't waste my time.
-l'll call you in 5 minutes bye..
-Hello
Sir, it was a very short call.
Couldn't trace..
lt is not from the same number sir
Sir, there was a call from the
Wall Tax road police station..
There is nobody in the name
of Thayumanvar in that address.
All the police stations in Chennai
should be in stand by.
l want 100 percent compliance.
-Sir. -Did you meet Commissioner?
-Yes sir. What problem? -l'll give to him
-Yes sir -Marar
-Yes sir
Who is Edward?
There is no senior police officer
in the name of Edward
No such officer. Just to buy time,
l told a lie sir
-lf anything happened wrong?
-Will not happen.
Before that we can.. but if you talk,
it will be good sir
ls he threatening you
that he put bombs?
lf he put bombs as he told..
There could be death and destruction..
as there is no ultimate authority like you
-Give to the madam
-Yes
-l will give.
-lt won't be good if l talk.
Sir, yes sir. Yes..
Then situation will rise as anybody
can talk to CM.
You can handle it yourself.
-No.. yes.. What sir.. Me?
-Yes!
Sir, authority okay sir..
if you tell me.. l'll do it. -Take care of it
Mr. Marar, CM has given me the power
to take decision related to this
So, you are the official negotiator. Good
l can. But, this is law and
order problem.
Terrorists. Bomb threat, strategically
correct move. . .
..is to be handled by the
police department.
lt's your home pitch!
CM won't.
lf Chief Secretary can't,
who else can?
Police.. DGP. . . don't know.
lf nobody can't
Why not? l will handle
But, but on one condition.
There should be no hindrances.
No interference no red tape
Will not be there.
Even though a word with CM
l said no interference, whatsoever.
You can decide.
They gave the power to you.
So no shuffling back and forth
it won't be strategically correct
Right, you take it up Mr. Marar.
lts all yours.
Nobody will ask any
question for anything
-lt is your promise!
-My promise is C.M's promise.
Take it up Mr. Marar.
l am giving it as an order.
lt's all yours.
You will win it and stop, but..
-lf didn't win, isn't?
-Not like that. -Fine.
lf won, all of us can share the success.
Well grossed and deserved
to be shared.
lf failed, then you
want me to resign. ls it so?
No Mr.Marar.
But question may rise.
-Someone have to..
-Take the blame
-No.. the responsibility
-lf fails, isn't.
l will take the blame
sorry responsibility all alone!
..should be a scapegoat
and l am ready to be one.
Not only Kerala.
This is my land too.
l will do my work.
Come on guys
-Back to work
-Mr. Marar.
lf you think its going to be a. . .?
-Sir, phone
-lt is him!
Hello!
Mr. Marar! Where is Edward?
He will not come
How will he come
when there is nobody like that?
This is the last warning.
Do not fool around with me.
Who is going to negotiate with me?
CM, PM, some under secretary. Who?
Do you expect the CM and
PM to come to your call?
They told like that when they
came to seek votes.
l think that now they are busy
after got the power.
Let them come after the bomb blast.
Now, who is going to talk with me?
Some secretary, lAS officer
l will talk to you
-Whatever.. -What you want?
Anything lawful
-Lawful
-l don't understand
No, no. it's an inside joke.
l have many in laws.
Ahmadulla, lnayathula,
Abdulla, Karamchand lala
l understand. They are..
You forget who they are!
You arrested two of them in
Coimbatore bomb blast case.
Another two were arrested by your
department from Kanyakumari..
..and one from Madurai.
What should l do with them?
Nothing. Release them.
l think there will be
no problem for you
There is no problem.
lt has become usual.
Have to catch by taking risk
of our lives, then release them..
..when get a call from a
politician or terrorist.
And we have to collect the
bodies of our colleagues..
..and go home directly. lt became usual
l have no time
to console you.
Three persons among the four
are in your city jail.
One poor guy is in Bangalore jail.
l will call within an hour.
Before that all of them
should be at one place.
lf you waste the time, any how
it will be evening.
lt'll be 6'o clock.
Whether it will be in the
public place, bus or train.
You would not know where it would
explode, but l know. Bye Bye!
Hey.. Wait!
Are you serious?
Do you think that one wastrel
plays with you? Mr. Marar
You don't even own a name!
-Even the cell phone is not in your name
-Okay.
Now your intelligence might have smelt
and told about my number..
..where from it came and all.
Still, let me update you.
First time l called in the name
of Thayumanavar.
He died in the Coimbatore bomb blast.
Second call was from
Yashwanth Koladkar.
Died in Mumbai blast.
Third one was Asha Barua.
She and her daughter died
in Gowhati.
Child was in her womb.
She was pregnant.
All are in the list of the dead.
l have no attachments
with the living ones.
4 sim cards. One mobile phone.
Any Tom, Dick and Harry
can threaten to win anything.
So what you think?
There is 3 kg RDX bomb primed..
..and ready to blast in the
Anna Salai police station..
..within the commanding area
of Mr. lGR Marar..
..it will explode in 20 minutes.
Can any Tom, Dick and Hari do this?
Mr. Marar
-ls it true?
-Go and see.
You can understand
if it is true or not.
This is not in that list of 5.
Just like a free sample like something
given by the sweet shop.
lt will blast within 20 minutes
Starting now
Hello! lt is a
fairly long call.
-Did you trace it?
-Sir, he is in the city.
But l think he is moving very fast.

Already terrorists are far ahead of the

So many Tamil Gods are nearby. . .

-Sir -No problem should

No problem for the election result
Because, if our opposition parties know
about it, they will arrange press meet
..and spread the news immediately.
Every party has its own channel.
Yes sir
Nothing should happened

Do you need any help from the central?
From the central, any help..?

lf you ask me, what can l do?
What do you want me to do?
Should l take a gun and run
through Mount Road like a mad man?
Tell me.
We can do.
Would the control get
transferred to us then?
Come on, what do you think?
Mr. commissioner!
Please remember whom you are talking to.
Chief Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu
l am not a secretary to anyone.
l am an ordinary commissioner of police
in the uniform.. even ready to die.
A glorified constable.
l am doing my duty.. that's all
Mr. Marar! Don't take it personally
You told that two officers
are going with that terrorist.
Who are they?
Two officers from my team
Many senior officers are here.
Mr. Periya karuppan.
What is his name Mr. Ramachandran?
-Who went to Mumbai on deputation in
the period of '96 blasts... -That is right!
You should have asked him!
You gave me permission to work
freely without any interruption.
Do you still stand by that or not?
No other way. . . that four persons?
We can leave them now
and again catch them later.
Dead or alive
lf the public ask about
the terrorists in heavy security..
..do you want me to answer
as we will leave and catch?
There was a small crack in the security.
Using that they escaped.
Don't we have the reasons to tell?
Dismissing the commissioner
for his irresponsibility.
Even you can tell like this,
very happily in the press conference
Mr. Marar, you have caught
the tail of a tiger
Soon l will catch the head also.
Don't worry
As per the information got just now,
4 terrorists are shifting to an anonymous
place by the police department.
Their names are Abdhulla, Ahmathulla,
lnayathulla and Karamchand.
We can watch what the senior officer
speaking about it.
Mr. Sethuraman, what is the reason for
transferring the terrorists suddenly.
Hello!
Mr. Marar, whatever happened
was happened well
Now onwards let to happen as l told
l will call later
Natasha, keep him engaged.

Where should they come?
Where the Chozhavaram race will be
conducted, l hope you know.
ln that airport, in a corner, bring our
warriors and leave them.
You all keep away from them.
l need a lot of landing space
Sharp at 5'o clock
-They will be there ok!
-No no wait!
Mr. Marar l haven't yet finished my talk
With our warriors, how many
persons are going for security.

-Too much.
Only two persons should go.
Ask them to bring two cell phones too.
Speaker facility and conference
facility should be in that cells
-Conference call for all
-Sure
One more thing.
l put bombs around the airport.
That is for our safety.
So don't experiment with snuffer dogs,
commando action etc.
The number of police widows
will be increased.
l want to know one thing
l don't have no time
Why do you act like this?
Hide, run and threatening to achieve
the matters are not good for a warrior.
Come to the light and fight.
-Brave death for you or for me
-Good speech
We are cowards.
And you be the warriors
in uniform.
Get the DA, TA, gallantry award and all.
And be happy.
Don't waste the time
by teasing me.
-You have no time for that Mr. Marar
-Ok!
lf we release these 4 persons,
what is the guarantee that
you will tell about the places..
..where you kept bombs
To give guarantee and warranty,
am l selling pressure cookers?
Why thousands of innocent people
should die?
What sin they have done?
Relax commissioner sir
Believe me.
There is no other way.
lf you obey me as l told, l'll leave
your city as a peaceful garden.
All right

lightning speed! -He should be a Superman!
Sir, l think he made a route
through the computer.
He should be a communication specialist
You cant find, isn't?
-Sir. lf we get an expert advisor. . .!
-What type of expertise?

stealthy recon, remote sniffing sir
Get me an expert in the field.

-Private plans,
Flight plans look all etc.. -Sir
God, l hope they will not hijack

Sir. Sub inspector is waiting,
he says he has seen the man.
He told the name as Srinivasa Ramanujam.
This is the address and

the photo of Lord Venkateswara.
He has beard sir.
How was the beard?
Beard like this..

Like this.

He purposefully confused you.
Otherwise you were

No sir.. l can remember clearly.
He came to complaint that
his purse was pick pocketed.
-He came..
-Any more details about him?
Think about it and tell.
He was left handed sir
-Sethu
-Sir
l tried the number.
Message came as this number
is not in use.
Asked to verify the Ashok Nagar address.
For what? Surely it will
not be his address.
To give real address, is he a fool?
Call the computer graphics staff.

You are just showing
But this is not a cricket match, damn it!
Absolutely it is not that.

Fear. All are cowards
Hello officer, where we are
going for the picnic?
To the graveyard?
Encounter.
Will you leave to run and shoot?
..or kill and bury?
What? Are they able to kill?
They are fearing and shivering
l have no fear.
Who will fear when one is ready to die?
Hey Lala, do you have fear?
We are in this work.
We have to face it.
Leave me. Let me go off.
Always you are telling this.
You did it freely?
Didn't you earn?

Wife, third wife.
She was beautiful
..son aged 16 years

Went to Bakery to buy cake.
Best bakery. You might have heard.
Time was bad.
There was riot!
They came as a crowd.
They boiled and threw them out.
..not the cake but my wife and my son
Leave it. Even lost one,
don't you have two more..
-Adjust with that
-Keep quiet
Police too were keeping quiet
Police were just watching!
lf he shouted a little, my son might
not be in the heaven now.

in the house
lf l was there

Where? ln Gujarat?
Wow!
You should fight there,
then you will understand. . .
lf you fight. . . You will be dead
l didn't come to die,

Arif, turn off the phone speaker
and give it to Mr.Abdhulla
Hello
Abdhulla bhai, did they
give any medicine..
..or injection
to you before you start?
Nothing
Did they compel to eat anything?
They put hand cuff, that it would
look good on the hand.
Don't worry, that will be unlocked soon.
As per God's wish!
Switch on the speaker
and give to Arif
-Tell me. -Mr. Arif! Remove their
handcuffs immediately
Do you see a jeep on the
corner of the air strip?
-Yes!
-You keep away from that jeep.
l need a lot of space

The four warriors may board the jeep.
You return back to commissioner office.
You all go towards the jeep.
lnayathulla in the driving seat.
Ahmathulla in the near by seat.
The other two persons in the back seat.
You must sit in this order.
This is the order l got

Key is in the jeep. lf you board on it,
you will understand where to go.
Phone will come.
All these should happen

Mr.commissioner!
Are you listening?
Yes continue
Arif after coming with his
colleague to your office..

Ok. Listen up everybody,
Your ten minutes starts now.
Arif, do as he said
Right sir
Go!
Excuse me
Surely this is a local call
lf it comes again,
l will tell exactly
-Are you sure? -Absolutely!
He is brainy but not an expert.
Arif, what are you doing?
Leave him
What if they escape without knowing
the information about the bombs?
lt will be a big mistake
lt's commissioner's order
Let it be.
We released the other three,
we will take him with us.
After knowing the information
about bombs, we can release him
l am going to call the commissioner
Even if he orders, l will not release him.
That is not subordination.
Are you crazy?
Superiors will be watching us
-Let them watch.
-Arif, listen to me. Don't do.
What is going to do for Abdullah?
You get off!
Why am l? l will..
Don't you come, silently?
Get in!
Will they leave you to go?
Didn't l tell that the phone will come?
Get in!
You are committing mistake.
-What did you say? -l told you
that you are committing mistake.
Didn't you hear?
-l enjoy doing the wrong.
-Leave me
-Or you will suffer for it.
-You..
-Come, will you?
-What are you thinking? Start it.
See, phone is ringing.
-What? -See,
where is it ringing.
-lt is in front side!
-Search it! -See!
Arif
-What?
-Phone ringing sound!
May be in the jeep.
He may call to give instruction.
Let's go
Take it, fast!
Leave me, l have to go!
-lnayathulla, don't go
-Damn it, come on.
Hello, tell me where you
have planted the bombs!
First you call Arif.
Ask what happened there.
l want to know it
-Sir!
-What happened?
Sir, it is very confusing!
-Something unexpected has happened
-What?
His plan was not to release
the terrorists. To kill.
There was a bomb in the jeep.
When the jeep started,
it was blasted
All the three are dead
You mean 4 persons
No sir three persons
Ahmathulla, lnayathulla,
Karamchand lala.
Abdhulla is alive
l am bringing him for the enquiry
My god! Why the hell did you do this?
You did a mistake Arif
Ok. No problem.
Put the phone in speaker mode.
Let Abdulla also hear.
l want to release all that
four from this world
But that work is not over yet.
Mr.Arif!
You have to finish that now itself
Sorry, we can't understand
Mr. Marar if a cockroach from
your toilet enters the kitchen..
..will you nurture it?
Or hit with the broom and
throw it away?
l did that job only.
l am cleaning my home
Who are you?
With original name, pet name,
common name, family name
Why are you asking the bio data,
Mr. Commissioner?
You know me.
Met me so many times
There is a queue in front
of the ration shop..
..to purchase the very old rice
and kerosene
l may be the last person
standing in that queue.
You point out a person in the markets,
mosques, temples, streets.
l might be that person
Wherever a train burned,
broke a building, a politician died
My life will go first.
They will burn me with
petrol in middle of a street.
One will come to your police station
to request, to save his life and properties
You will treat him like a criminal.
Do you remember?
That was me.
l am the common man
who you think as a wastrel.
l am just a stupid
common man of this republic.
Why a common man became a superman
and purchased 6 kilos of RDX?
Do you think that
l am a superman?
l think l am an invisible man.
Because my name is erased
from the voter list.
When l go to enquire about it, they ask me
to believe that l don't exist.
How can l believe that?
So, Mr.Commissioner..
To purchase RDX bomb,
there is no need of a superman
An invisible man like me is enough.
Go to the internet and search the bomb
100 websites will show
how to make a bomb.
So don't ask me how.
Ask me why.
Leave it.
Now one more insect is left.
Shoot it.
l will take it as 4 men are dead.
Why only these four?
There are so many terrorists in lndia.
What are you going to do with them?
l just gambled. Only these
four names came first.
lf we didn't kill Abdhulla,
will you tell me..
..you will kill thousands
of innocent people?
You can't prevent the death of
that thousand innocent people.
lf you release him, he'll kill millions.
l ask only one life.
But he is asking the life
of million people.
Compare the both.
lt's a good trade of. Kill him
-Who are you?
-You will not..
When hijack the plane
to Kandahar or Afghanistan,
..you should have shot him dead.
But you didn't do that.
Sent off giving money in bags.
Again returned and attacked
the parliament. His heirs in 26/1 1
Returned and attacked the
railway station and hotel.
We cried for a few days.
Then forgot it
A bomb was blast in Meenambakkam,
Chennai in the past,
How many people do remember that?
We have forgot it
Do we forgive or not..
We are forgetting.
Forgetting is a national disease.
Showing the gun, he is asking
that what you can do.
lf there is an immediate punishment,
will they do these crimes and shooting?
You expect instant justice like
two minutes noodles.
Do you think it is practical?
Why not? Terrorism is instant.
Why should not justice be so.
Who are you?
-l can't understand?
-You killed Muslim terrorists.
So are you a Hindu?
Karamchand is a Hindu, arms dealer.
l killed him.
So am l a Muslim?
You go on play the Hindu Muslim
ln the national TV our
west door cried a lot.
And said enough..
When ask to come to vote..
Don't join me with the group
..that will not show even their finger
for the 43% democracy.
l will clearly tell who l am.
A terrorist killing the terrorists.
Answer me straight.
Who are you?
Hindu or Muslim?
May not be a Christian?
Buddhist? Communist, Atheist.
Don't they get angry?
Still you didn't tell, we knew
many things about you.
Style, dressing, gestures,
your left handed character
Oh.. you know everything.
Leave it, what do you know
about Mahatma Gandhi?
You don't deserve
to tell his name.
Do you have?
Who else has it?
Gandhi used to write with both
the hands, you know?
He was ambidextrous!
Unfortunately l am his fan too.
l also have no difference in writing,
even use right or left hand.
-But it is for writing only.
-Ambidextrous?
Acutely scared.
Do you fear that you will be killed
if caught by the police
May be
Yes or no.
Tell the answer in binary.
You fear, isn't?
-Yes l fear!
-Always that fear should be in your mind.
What you want to prove
will not succeed.
Succeeded.
To make you roam like this,
only four weeks were needed.
For this common man
with this common intelligence.
Do you think that they are more
intelligent than me?
Planting the bomb, they can threaten
our political power and business center.
Why should we bother about it?
We are from different places.
We are in Tamil Nadu.
lf a bomb blast in Mumbai, we will
not show it even in the Tamil channel.
lf happened to us, it is a disaster.
lf happened to them, it is news.
Our Tamil Nadu is a peaceful garden.
They are using other languages
lf a knife cuts the heart in Mumbai,
why should we bother.
We are safe by standing in Kanyakumari.
We think like that.
Now he asks by pointing
the gun on the head.
Asking that what you are going to do?
100 men asking 100 crores of men.
As what the hell you are going to do.
Nobody replied.
Now l am replying.
That you can't bear. lsn't?
Explosion, bomb blast.
You are telling again and
again about it, why?
Did anyone from your family
or friends die of bomb attack?
Ok.
Since you asked,
l will tell a story.
Only a short story.
Only one daughter, Mr. Marar.
Four months carrying.
Came home to stay with her parents.
North lndia. Winter season
One day night, chased her in
the middle of the market..
..in the shivering cold.
They tied her hands back as she should not
pray God seeking the help.
When she fell down on the road..
On her body.. On her body..
They removed all her dress
as there was not a bit on her body.
Crowd all around
l didn't know how many Ramakrishnans,
Lal krishnans,..
..Radhakrishnans were in that crowd.
Even one of that krishnans
didn't come to help her.
At that time, the mere at last
of that girl..
We are adults Mr.Marar.
You policemen might have seen a lot.
l am telling openly.
They put the hand inside
her female organ..
..and aborted her Mr. Marar
Abortion.
When l knew the meaning
of that word, she..
..and her child were no more.
To cry, to shed tears, to get angry..
..should she be my daughter?
lf she was a daughter of my brother,
My friend,
A Muslim..
..shouldn't l shed tears?
Ah.. what is the justice?
Jaihind..
You asked my name. lsn't?
l will tell..
One Karamchand died
in the bomb blat just now,
let it be my name.
What answer you
have to tell this Karamchand?
You go out of your office
One Karamchand will be in the junction
What the answer you will tell him?
Don't know. l will tell.
Terrorism is the only weapon
to destroy the terrorism.
That l told today.
Fakr hai muje
l can't understand you
Do you find my logic hard to digest?
-May be! -Yes or no answer
in binary Mr. Commissioner
-Yes
-Good!
lf they kill 300 or 400 people,
you will keep quiet.
As the court would answer.
lf l kill four among them,
you are shouting like this.
Why the common human rights for them
when it is not for the common man.
Ok.. l don't blame you.
You have designed a figure that
a common man should be like this,..
even you know that l am a common man,
you raised your voice.
You think that l am just joking
and easy to catch.. Don't you think?
-l will not think like that
-Good!
Happy to know that.
Because, all the bombs
l set are ready to blast.
Mr. Arif
Whether it is my last call or not,
You have to decide.
Do you want me to wait
on the line, or disconnect?
No no.. Don't disconnect
What you want me to do?
Ok. That TV girl and cameraman will come
there in 10 minutes.
An ambulance should come with them.
A doctor would be in it.
Doctor should check the heartbeat
of Abdhulla..
..and confirm his death
through the channel.
You see the picture and tell the story.
l will tell you where the bombs are.
Arif, l will call you back
Ok sir
Arif, he is a cheater, Kafir
He didn't know anything.
This is about our religion brother.
We are chasing America
in lraq and Afghanistan
like that we should stand united.
Nobody can do anything.
Abdhulla you did a mistake.
Why you didn't stay
in Afghanistan?
Why you came to lndia?
The anger of a common man.
See what happened.
You also might be killed
A jihad warrior like me
will not have fear of death.
l am ready to do any sacrifice.
For jihad and for my religion..
Why are you laughing?
l know that!
You fear for death
-Yeah! -We will decide it later.
-You are right.
-Hello!
-Ms. Natasha where are you?
Outside the airport
Good.
Go near the air strip.
Headlines is waiting for you
Ok!
Let's go!
Mr. Marar,
Everything gone
beyond our limit.
-Now?
-Do you want to call the CM?
Yes, serious matters
He has to decide.
You can't decide that this matter
should go to CM or not
What do you mean?
You have given me the ultimate authority
Not governance
Limited powers as dictated by democracy
-Dictated by democracy?
-Yes! -That's nice!
Why do you talk like a politician?
l have no time to listen!
So, are you going to act directly?
-Yes!
-There will be consequences Mr. Marar!
l have thought well
lf it missed?
My head will be sacked. Okay
lt's going to be your funeral.
You are invited with pleasure
No l am not interested to participate
Even though l never like this
from the beginning.
Mutual feelings madam
See, she forgot the cell.
Go and give her.
Clean it with napkin and give.
She wants to keep her hands clean
Clean hand
Mr. Marar.
l respect you now.
Mutual madam.
-Arif
-Sir
Head
Yes sir!
No, Arif!
Leave me, Arif!
Why you didn't tell before
Sorry! lt is Commissioner's order.
Look there.
What happened?
l don't know sir.
Program got crashed
You mean you can't find?
You told he is not a genius!
He is a great man than l expected.
lt is very important than to be a genius
So what are you?
Nothing.. one among 100 crores
-Sir!
-Excuse me, sir!
l don't know whether he is it or not, sir
What are the resemblances between
this photo and the person you saw
Sir.. l misspelled in tension.
l couldn't remember that he had beard.
He will not be like this.
-Between this and him..
-6 differences..
60.. 600 differences..
All you say. . . won't you not?
Yes sir.. No sir.. Sorry sir!
When the terrorists try to escape,
the police severely fought with them..
..and one inspector got injured severely.
His name is Arif khan.
Here, the doctors are
giving treatment to him.
Mr. Sethuraman is with us.
Let's listen what he says.. Sir
For the security reason
We used to shift the terrorists from
one place to another for security reason.
Like that, when we shifted today,
Arif Khan was shot at.
We retaliated for that. That's all.
Thank you
This old air strip has become
a hot news today.
4 terrorists brought here by the police
with protection tried to escape..
..and shot by the police.
Why they've been brought here?
Where have they planned to go from here?
How the terrorists tried to escape?
As usual the police keep silent
for these questions.
Hello

lrinjalakkuda Govindhan Raghava Marar.
Commissioner of police
He told his name.
What is in a name?
Let him be a common man!
A poor guy!
He had boldness, courage,
annoyance, moral anger..
Hats off to him!
That case has not been
registered anywhere.
The terrorists tried to escape.
So, what do you do?
Shoot them down and
sack the commissioner.
Don't know if it is right or wrong
whatever happened.
One thing is sure!
Whatever has to happen has happened.
