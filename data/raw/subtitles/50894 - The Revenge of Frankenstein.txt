- Well, what do you say?
- I don't like it.
What is wrong with it?
Nothing wrong with it.
I just don't like it.
Look here, my old friend...
You are my friend, aren't you?
Yes.
Would I suggest anything
that might go wrong?
You would.
Look at the last time. You were
supposed to watch in the street.
- How was I to know they kept dogs?
- I've still got scars.
It ain't like that.
We don't have to break in anywhere.
Nothing can go wrong.
That's what you said the time before.
I got six months.
I've had enough of it.
All right then. All right.
We won't say no more about it.
Forget I ever mentioned it.
If you don't trust me, it's all right.
I'll just have to do it on my own.
All right then.
I'm going home.
The doctor did say that I mustn't do
anything that might strain my heart.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I shall have the 10 marks myself.
- Ten! You said six!
- Ten, I meant.
That don't worry you none
because you ain't coming with me.
Ten. Ten marks...
...for a dead one.
Yeah, well, like I say. You gotta
know where to find these things.
You gotta keep your eyes open.
Take this one for a start.
He only got planted this morning, you
know? He'll be as fresh as a daisy.
- Who is he?
- Who?
Him!
Or is it "her"?
No, it can't be a her. It only came
from the prison this morning.
Don't stand there talking.
We ain't got all night!
Come and have a look!
- A baron!
- Shall we get any more for him?
I've never seen a real-life baron
before. Come on, hurry up!
Here.
It's a priest with no head!
What if he is a priest?
He's dead, isn't he?
Still worth 10 marks to me, isn't he?
Of course, the head's
a bit of a problem.
Good evening.
I am Baron Frankenstein.
I ask you, gentlemen,
what do we really know about him?
Nothing at all.
He came here three years ago
and set himself up.
Before then, no one had heard of him.
Do any of you know his background?
- No.
- No. No more do I.
Here he is, well-established.
The most popular doctor in Carlsbruck.
He hasn't applied
for the Medical Council.
I've even heard he says
he can do without it.
He's right. He's managed
to steal half my best patients.
- And mine.
- And mine.
- Exactly! And mine too.
- Your wife amongst them, sir?
- Yes, well, I put a stop to that!
- Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Dr. Stein must be made
to join this council...
...or else he is no longer permitted
to practice in this city.
If he refuses to join, how do you
intend to stop him practising?
Mr. President?
We have never attempted
to prevent any doctor from practising.
However, Dr. Stein's refusal to join,
to become one of us, is an affront.
- Quite so.
- Are there any suggestions?
- Oh, well...
- Send a delegation to see him.
- Excellent. Yes. Made up of...?
- Three.
Yes. Three doctors from the council.
That is what I suggest.
Second it.
- All in favour?
- Yes.
- Fine. Fine.
- We ought to make an appointment.
Right. No one gets into his surgery
without an appointment.
- Dr. Stein, Vera is in great distress!
- Indeed, Countess Barscynska.
You insist she's cured
but I see no improvement.
She's weak, the movement
of every muscle is an effort.
Raise your head, Vera.
Higher, my child!
You see? No animation, no vitality.
You must revise your diagnosis.
Overhaul her!
Vera, my dear, go and prepare
yourself. Yes, yes.
What was Vera's original complaint?
Really, Dr. Stein! It started
with palpitations, then dizziness...
- How could you forget?
- She's not my only patient.
Those women outside are all in perfect
condition. Nothing wrong with them.
You should be my partner.
We could dispose of surgery quicker.
That'd mean half the money.
Their fees subsidize your work
at the poor hospital.
I know how good you are
to the poor, doctor.
- Vera, she's all I have in the world.
- Of course.
There's very little more
I can do for her.
Doctors can't diagnose maladies
which aren't there.
You are a man, doctor!
You can do a great deal for her.
All I have goes to Vera when she
marries. Her father's last wish.
Now I'm having a musical evening soon.
I hope you'll come.
I have very little free time.
Poor man! A life devoted to others.
No time for a life of your own.
There's always time
for important things.
- Doctor, I'm ready!
- So am I, Vera. You may come out.
You see? Just a few steps
and the poor child is exhausted.
- I'll go wait outside.
- No, please. It is better you stay.
- You always used your ear before.
- This just magnifies the sound.
- Oh, Mama, it's so cold!
- Stand still, dear.
- Breathe deeply.
- I can't. That thing's so cold.
Can you hear the palpitations?
Wouldn't it be better to use your ear?
There's three men to see you, doctor.
They're from the Medical Council.
- They must wait until after surgery.
- They're impatient.
- When I'm finished!
- You're the doctor.
Have them wait in the ward.
- What? In the ward?
- In the ward!
And shut the door!
Hey, you! Tell Dr. Stein
I want me rum ration!
Murdering butcher is what he is!
I'll strangle him with me bare hands!
You'll frighten him.
- How can I dance without me legs?
- Got to learn to sing!
This way, gentlemen.
This way.
This is intolerable!
You must remember that these are
the poorer. The stench will kill me.
Dr. Stein says for you to make
yourselves comfortable.
Comfortable! You tell Dr. Stein...
There's Dr. Stein, gentlemen.
Looking after the poor and needy.
Look at this. Interesting, isn't it?
A work of art. What do you think?
- Picturesque.
- We didn't come here to...
- You must have this arm off.
- Strangle him with one arm!
- He ain't having my arm.
- You'd rather die?
- Let him have it.
- It don't pain me.
- It's of no use to you.
- What do you mean?
- 5:00 in the theatre.
- I won't be able to work no more.
- What is his work?
- Pickpocket.
Find another trade
or use the other hand.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Is he new?
- Admitted today.
- Me pipe!
- What's wrong?
- It's me chest.
- You use it like a furnace.
Amazing how dirty these people are.
It keeps them warm, they tell me.
Well, what can I do for you?
- I'm president of the Medical Council.
- Congratulations.
It was agreed that you should
become a member.
Really? Have this new man washed,
then I'll look at him.
- I'm greatly honoured.
- Then you accept?
No.
Every doctor regards your attitude
as an insult.
When I arrived in Carlsbruck
and attempted to set up in practice...
...I was resisted by the Council
which exists to eliminate competition.
I have built up a highly
successful practice, unaided.
Having grown accustomed
to working alone, I find I prefer it.
- Do I make myself clear?
- Quite.
Thank you. Good day.
- You haven't heard the last of this!
- Like he cares!
What more can I do?
He won't pick any more pockets.
Have the parcel ready.
- Right. Your supper is ready.
- Good night.
- Good night, doctor.
- And thank you.
A masterly dissection, Dr. Stein.
- You must forgive this intrusion.
- Must I?
I wanted to renew our acquaintance.
After this afternoon...
...I was sure I had seen you before.
I've been practising in Carlsbruck
for three years.
Before that. More than three years ago
at the village of Inkstadt.
I was attending the funeral
of Professor Bernstein.
- You've heard of him, no doubt.
- Everyone has heard of him.
I was a student at the university
where he was lecturing when he died.
- May I offer you chicken, Dr...?
- Hans Kleve. No.
A little cheese?
I can recommend it.
He was buried in the family vault
of Baron Frankenstein.
- Shall I go on?
- Please. Please do.
- I'm the first to recognize you?
- For what you'd have me be?
The resemblance is too striking. Your
activities lead to one conclusion.
- And what if I am this Frankenstein?
- Are you?
You were telling me.
Now you're asking?
Why are you so interested
in this gentleman?
- I'm in search of knowledge.
- Knowledge? So that's it.
My name is Frankenstein, I'll admit.
It's a large family, you know.
Remarkable for productivity. There are
offshoots everywhere. Even in America.
- There's a town in Germany.
- Are you the Frankenstein?
- There are Frankensteins in Silesia.
- Are you Baron Frankenstein?
- Yes, Dr. Kleve.
- I was sure of it!
I told you that I'm in search
of knowledge. I want to learn more.
I want to be the pupil
of the greatest doctor in the world.
- Your pupil, Baron Frankenstein.
- Highly commendable.
- And if I refuse?
- You won't.
So, either I employ you
in my researches or...
Surely this is blackmail?
An ugly trait in a doctor.
I see it as mutual reciprocation.
Your knowledge for my assistance.
And your silence?
- I'm not an easy man to work for.
- Few men are.
When you've learned
all you want to know...
...you might change your mind
about keeping silent.
I wonder if I can trust you.
But then uncertainty is part
of life's fascination, isn't it?
I'll take the risk if you will.
Will you accept me as your pupil?
Where did you study?
Under Anderson in Edinburgh,
Karl Strauss in Vienna...
Enough!
My practice is negligible.
When do we start?
You must exercise great caution
when addressing me.
My name is Stein. Victor Stein.
Yes, of course. The Austrian
or Swiss branch of that family?
Let's settle for Switzerland. It's an
exhilarating climate. Please join me.
After supper, I'll show you
around my laboratory.
- Evening, doctor.
- Good evening.
The other one is down below,
waiting for you.
Not the best setting for a laboratory,
but it's ideal for my purpose.
Careful! It would be a pity
to lose you so soon.
Surprised?
Originally, this was a wine cellar.
Karl, this is Dr. Kleve.
He is to work with us.
- Do we really need him?
- Oh, yes.
Dr. Kleve presented himself
just at the right moment.
The doctor trusts me, Karl.
I hope you will too.
This is Otto, our chimpanzee.
Karl, you collected the parcel?
Yes, doctor. It's over here.
- That's the arm of the pickpocket!
- It is, indeed.
You need sensitive fingers to be in
that profession. It'll be very useful.
Now, come here.
What is it?
- A brain.
- A brain?
If you put your hand by a fire,
what makes you move it?
- The nerves.
- Exactly.
The nerves of the hand send a message
to the brain.
The brain activates the muscles
to withdraw the hand.
You don't put your hand
near the fire if you see it.
The eye recognizes fire
as a harmful agent.
Let me demonstrate.
Now observe.
The brain, the hand, the eyes.
Watch the eyes.
Fascinating, isn't it?
So this is a brain.
All this paraphernalia and capable
of only one simple reaction.
Imagine the complexity of the human
brain, a million times more efficient.
It controls every action and reaction,
stores memories, motivates all life.
- This is all I've been able to do.
- I've never seen anything like it.
Haven't you?
No, I don't suppose you have.
You know that l...? That Frankenstein
was condemned to death?
- Yes.
- Do you know what for?
Everyone knows.
The story's become a legend.
He created a man who became a monster.
It should have been perfect.
I made it to be perfect.
If the brain wasn't damaged, my work
would be a scientific achievement.
He would've been accepted as a genius.
Instead, he was sent to the
guillotine.
I swore I would have my revenge.
They will never be rid of me.
This is something I am proud of.
- Who is he?
- Nobody. He isn't born yet.
But this time he is perfect.
Except for a few scars, he is perfect.
You made him from other bodies?
My work at the poor hospital
serves me very well.
All I need is a brain
and then I can give it life.
You've seen the result of this.
It's not my first attempt.
I keep this to remind me
of the impossibility of the task.
The brain must be a living one. Unlike
the limbs, life cannot be restored...
...once life has gone. The brain is
life, so a living brain must be used.
- Surely that would mean murder?
- Not necessarily. I have a volunteer.
He's here, in the laboratory.
No, Hans, not you.
Your brain is too valuable
where it is. He's over there.
- You mean Karl?
- Yes. We made a bargain.
If he saved me from the guillotine,
I'd give him a new body.
His paralysis indicates
a brain injury.
I examined him. The paralysis is due
to a blood clot. It can be dispersed.
He has a fine brain.
He's quick, intelligent...
...and he's absorbed a lot
of knowledge since working with me.
Dr. Stein is welcome to my brain.
As long as he rids me of...
...this.
- You have great faith in Dr. Stein?
- I have.
Are you sure it can be done?
The operation will be
a complete success.
There's a young woman asking
for you, doctor.
She's a real lady. She's got scent on.
Must have come to the wrong surgery.
Where is she?
She's in the doctor's room.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Dr. Stein is not here, I understand?
No, no. He's at his surgery in town.
- Would you like to sit down?
- Yes, thank you.
- You don't mind if I get cleaned up?
- No, please do.
I'm Margaret Conrad.
I shall be working here.
Oh? The doctor didn't tell me
about that.
My father is the minister.
Dr. Stein has been informed.
I see.
I shall read to the sick. Shop for
them, get them things like tobacco...
...writing paper, soap.
Dear lady. They seldom wash
and they never write.
I'm sure you'll be able
to find plenty to do.
Thank you.
I won't disappoint you or Dr. Stein.
- Oh, I...
- Karl, this lady's going to work here.
- Did you want something, Karl?
- I was to... No, it can wait.
- If it's professional, I'll leave.
- No, please.
I'll come back.
- I gave him my hand, I didn't realize.
- He seemed quite taken with you.
- Is he a patient?
- No, he helps Dr. Stein.
There's a very sound brain
in that unfortunate body.
Are you quite sure
you want to work here?
I'm quite sure.
I tried to dissuade her
but it would be inconvenient...
...if I were forced to leave
because of her father.
She seems a very determined
young lady.
Get her to wash a patient.
That should frighten her away.
- You ready?
- Where are we going?
The laboratory.
Tonight, we give Karl his new body.
You wanted to learn, come on!
- Karl, are you ready?
- I'm ready, doctor.
Good.
Thank you.
You keep looking at him.
Very soon, that will be you.
Ready.
This is to preserve the body.
- Embalming fluid.
- Yes.
Hans.
Keep it steady at 80.
Dr. Stein!
Anaesthetic!
Quick, man!
Switch off!
All right.
- When will he regain consciousness?
- An hour or so.
His brain will take
some time to adjust.
He must have complete rest
and avoid any violent movement.
As a precaution, I shall keep him
strapped for a few days.
It was a superb operation.
I learned a great deal.
Thank you for your assistance.
It's only the beginning of our work.
Must be Otto's feeding time.
Yes, it is.
That was one of Karl's duties.
I better do it for him.
I wonder what he makes of all this.
He'd be interested, if he knew.
In my early experiments...
...I used reptiles. I replaced
the brain of a lizard with a frog's.
The lizard attempted to jump.
It proved my theory.
The brain continues its normal
function, regardless of environment.
Later, I used anthropoids.
I gave Otto the brain of an orangutan.
- Was it successful?
- You can see for yourself.
I want Karl close at hand,
where we can watch him.
We must get him to the hospital.
I've prepared the attic.
- Won't that be dangerous?
- Not if we take care.
Try to relax.
You're quite safe now.
He's bound to have some pain
as the anaesthetic wears off.
Karl.
Karl, can you hear me?
You've made wonderful progress
in the past week.
These are necessary
for a little while. I'm sorry.
It won't be for long.
- Hans?
- Yes.
Now...
Just reflect the light on his
right eye, will you?
Keep it steady.
Now, the left.
Yes, excellent.
Karl, try and move your left arm.
Left.
Now the right.
There's very little wrong
with you, Karl.
Congratulations.
I'm due in the ward now.
Dr. Kleve will stay with you.
- See to the straps.
- Yes.
Except for the movement of his right
arm, his reactions are excellent.
Talk to him.
Keep his mind fairly active.
When he shows fatigue,
give him one of those.
I'll go to the laboratory as soon as
I'm finished in the ward.
- You have your key?
- Yes.
Karl, you'll be up and wearing
those clothes in no time.
Dr. Kleve?
Yes, Karl?
When can I see my new body?
Very soon now.
I think you'll be proud.
Dr. Kleve, what is...
...to happen to me, after?
Oh, there are great plans for you.
Doctors and scientists will come from
all over the world to see you.
You're a very important person now.
Dr. Stein will hold lectures.
They'll see you,
a normal man with a normal body...
...side by side with your old body.
All my life I've been stared at.
It will be different now. You'll play
a great part in medical science.
- Are you in pain?
- No.
I think you'd better rest now.
Not too much excitement just yet.
Here.
Drink this.
Hello, Ned. Still suffering?
- How are you today?
- Better, miss, thank you.
Care for something?
Soap, writing paper or tobacco?
- I'll have it all in tobacco, miss.
- No soap?
I'll never use it.
Miss Conrad, I must ask you to keep
out of the ward when I'm on duty.
Have you anything to do?
Do it, then.
Yes, sir.
He's a moody guv, ain't he?
I beg your pardon!
I'm sorry, miss, but if you knew
what I knew...
Cruel, he is.
He cuts them up, you know.
Alive.
Don't talk such nonsense.
Let me tell you, he had a new one
in the other night.
Horrible state he was in.
Screaming his head off.
- I don't believe a word.
- You can see for yourself.
They keep him in a special room,
an attic. All locked up, of course.
Perhaps I'd better see him.
Just in case you're telling the truth.
- Would you show me the way?
- Of course.
I know where they keep the master key.
They don't know I know.
I know a lot of things
that might surprise them.
You wait here. I'll go and fetch it.
Oh, I might as well take
my tobacco now. In case I forget it.
Ta.
Lock him up when you're finished.
And let me have the key back.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I waken you?
- Miss Conrad, it's you.
- How did you know my name?
I've met you once before.
You wouldn't remember.
Did Dr. Stein send you to see me?
No. I just came to see...
...if you were comfortable.
Thank you.
- All right, come in.
- Thank you, doctor.
Oh, really, I didn't intend to...
Well, if you insist.
- Here you are.
- Thank you, doctor.
That's better.
Just the stuff for a cold day.
If you used that broom a bit more,
you wouldn't feel the cold.
How's the special patient, doctor?
- What do you know about him?
- Nothing.
Nothing at all, except he's special.
What's so different about him?
Ain't he got fleas?
If you washed,
you wouldn't have fleas.
Me, wash?
I'd catch pneumonia, like as not.
I'll have my fleas and keep
my health and strength.
What is your work?
I have no work.
You will soon get some.
You'll forget all about your illness.
I will help you when you're better.
You must come and see me.
I will write down my address
for you, shall I?
I'll put it in your pocket.
These straps, they hurt.
They're far too tight.
I'll loosen them for you.
Take the animals in the jungle.
They don't wash yet they keep healthy.
You never hear of them getting sick.
Why?
- They're good and dirty.
- What do you know about animals?
You'd be surprised.
I know all about their habits.
- Because you practise them yourself?
- What's wrong with that?
They was here before we was, and
they'll be here long after we've gone.
Take the monkeys. They got a good
layer of dirt to keep them warm.
Plenty to eat, plenty to drink.
I bet they laugh at us sometimes,
on the quiet, eh?
If you get hungry,
you have to cook yourself a meal.
Not them. They get hungry,
they reach out for a banana.
They don't worry about cooking.
They don't even eat meat.
- They don't, do they?
- Meat? Of course they don't.
Do you mind if I help myself
to another one, doctor?
No? Thanks.
Did Otto eat flesh
before you operated?
No, I discovered it soon after
the operation. He ate his wife.
- Ate another monkey?
- What else would he be married to?
- He turned into a cannibal?
- Yes. I didn't attempt to correct it.
He'd been through enough already,
and he's perfectly happy and healthy.
But surely...
I mean, couldn't the same thing
happen to Karl?
No. So long as his brain
is given time to heal.
Otto became agitated
after his operation.
He fractured one of the cells
of the brain.
Does Karl know
what happened to Otto?
Of course he does.
It's just as well.
He knows what could happen to him,
so he'll take no unnecessary risks.
Hans, I finished something today.
I'd like to show it to you.
What do you think of it?
I thought you'd be interested.
Before we go back to the hospital,
help me get him into the tank.
Who's down there?
Where are you?
You heathen beast!
There you are!
Afraid I'm gonna bust your skull in?
That'll teach you.
Don't hit me, please.
I won't hit you.
Now I'll have to hit you some more...
...to make up for all the damage
you've just done.
Get up!
How? He was asleep when I left him.
I gave him a sedative.
How could he undo the straps?
"Why," not "how."
There's always a reason why.
- What happened?
- I don't remember.
Pull yourself together, man!
Tell me!
I told him your plans for his future.
You told him that?
You fool! You stupid fool!
Do you know nothing
of human reactions?
Let me think. Where would he go?
The laboratory.
Look!
He burned his old body.
- The janitor disturbed him.
- Suppose his brain was damaged?
Sooner or later he'll need my help.
Go back to the hospital and carry on.
- But shouldn't we search for him?
- Do as I tell you!
Thank you, Joseph.
I'm just going in to see the ponies.
Hello, my lovelies.
How about a piece of sugar?
Piece of sugar for Mama?
How about you?
I've got a piece for you.
What are you doing here?
I had to get away.
You said you'd help me.
Does Dr. Stein know you've left?
No, don't tell him, please!
Please don't tell him!
- You'd better come with me.
- No, let me stay here.
- You need looking after. I must tell.
- No!
Karl, you cannot remain here,
not like this.
You've been kind to me.
Please, please...
...not Dr. Stein!
If I promise not to tell him, will you
stay here until I get back?
I won't be long.
- Try to rest this as much as you can.
- Yes, doctor.
Hans, I must speak to you.
It's urgent.
Come and see me again
in a few days' time.
I found Karl this morning.
He's at my aunt's home, in the stable.
- I must get Dr. Stein!
- No, no. Karl's terrified of him.
- I must get him.
- The poor man is out of his mind.
I promised him I wouldn't
bring Dr. Stein.
- Then I'd better come.
- I have a carriage.
Please!
- I thought I was helping him.
- Of course you did.
Karl, I brought Dr. Kleve.
But he was there!
I left one of the groomers with him.
Where's the man I told you
to look after?
I don't know. I watered the horses.
When I came back, he'd gone.
Dr. Stein must be told.
You stay in the house!
- Oh, stop that, can't you?
- What are you getting annoyed for?
What do you think? All you can find
to do is look at a lot of ants.
Ants is interesting.
You can learn a lot from ants.
- You haven't learned much.
- What do you mean?
They don't sit around all night.
They get on with it.
- On with what?
- I'm going home!
Good night, Gerda.
Is it much further?
We're in the park now.
The countess's house
is about three miles away.
Can't we go any faster?
I feel I'm to blame.
I thought it wiser to go myself.
When Miss Conrad...
You should have come at once!
Interfering women!
Why did you stop?
Oh, it's you, Dr. Stein.
Sorry to trouble you.
There's been a murder in the vicinity.
Can I be of assistance?
This is Dr. Kleve.
If you would examine the body,
we should like a report.
- Certainly.
- Come this way, sir.
- When did this happen?
- About an hour ago, this boy says.
Did you see who attacked her?
When he heard the girl scream...
...he shouted,
and then the man rushed off.
If it was a man.
What do you mean?
He said he had a strange shape.
Almost like an animal.
Of course, he only caught
a glimpse of him.
- This is no ordinary murder.
- Did you search the park?
- Thoroughly, sir.
- I'll let you have my report.
Thank you, sir.
Sorry to have detained you.
Nothing against English composers,
but they won't let themselves go.
- Not even Handel?
- He was stolen from Germany.
- Dr. Victor Stein, Dr. Hans Kleve.
- Dr. Stein, so you came after all.
- I wish to speak to your niece.
- The night is young. Vera, my dear!
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.
When you found Karl in the stable,
was he the same as in the hospital?
- Yes, but very distressed.
- Is that the last you saw of him?
- Are you certain he hasn't returned?
- Yes.
Frankenstein!
Frankenstein.
Help me.
"Frankenstein, help me!"
Those were his very words.
- Then what happened?
- The poor fellow collapsed, dead.
Stein and Kleve carried him out.
I summoned this meeting right away.
You did correctly, Dr. Molke.
We have to decide now, gentlemen.
Is this man Frankenstein or not?
While I was waiting
for the senior members to gather...
...I went through the records
relating to this Frankenstein.
His description fits our friend,
Dr. Stein, very closely.
Dr. Stein, I beg you to listen to me!
Get away from here,
across the border!
- We can start again somewhere else.
- There's no hurry.
But everyone heard Karl
call you Frankenstein!
Molke was there.
He'll report to the Medical Council.
They'll take action. It's the chance
they've been waiting for.
I always risked being identified.
- I made my plans accordingly.
- But...
I shall be at the surgery
in the morning.
Your waiting room is deserted.
The whole town knows.
I've been summoned before
the Medical Council.
- I'll come with you.
- That would be madness.
I've nothing to fear from them.
What can they prove?
On our way,
I have something to tell you.
- Gentlemen, I deny it absolutely!
- Deny your name is Frankenstein?
Have you consulted a street directory
for any town in central Europe?
You'll find dozens of Frankensteins.
I am a Frankenstein.
I'd heard of Baron Frankenstein,
who created that monster.
I didn't wish to be handicapped
by such a name, so I changed it.
But the uncanny resemblance?
This is a monstrous accusation!
Inspired by jealousy.
Baron Frankenstein?
Dr. Stein!
Dr. Stein.
Why did that fellow
call you Frankenstein?
For the very same reasons
as your own, I should imagine.
I think a little proof, rather than a
lot of gossip, would be advantageous.
- One moment.
- I'm a busy man. Good day.
Dr. Kleve, we have not yet
questioned you.
All right, open the coffin!
- It's a priest's hat!
- Rosary.
We were right.
Frankenstein is not dead.
He asked for proof.
Now we have it.
- How's the head, Kleiner?
- Don't lay your filthy hands on me.
Don't be a fool.
I've got to look at it.
Keep your murdering hands off me,
Frankenstein.
Yes, that's what I said.
Frankenstein!
Fugitive from the gallows.
Murderer. Mutilator.
Doctor, doctor!
They're killing him in there.
- Killing who?
- Frankenstein.
On the bed.
- Hans.
- Don't talk.
It's no good.
You know what to do.
Yes, I know.
What kind of a place is this?
I have a warrant for the arrest
of Victor Stein!
Come in, inspector.
- Where is he?
- This way.
What happened?
His patients at the hospital.
They went mad and tore him to pieces.
I brought him here and operated
in the hope of saving his life.
The body must be buried
in unhallowed ground.
As it should have been
three years ago!
Pray heaven I've got
the skill to do this.
You were an excellent pupil, Hans.
This scar will hardly show.
Your next patient is waiting,
Dr. Franck.
Thank you.
Lady Benborough and Wendy.
How nice to see you.
