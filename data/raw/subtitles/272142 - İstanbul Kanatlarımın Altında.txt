There is a mystery other
than all those solved so far.
There is a mystery other than all...
What does Omer Khayyam say...
...about mysteries we are unable to solve?
I will tell you.
I will tell you.
There is a mystery other than
all those solved so far.
There's a light,
other than all we saw.
Don't ever be satisfied with
whatever you've done. Go Ahead.
Don't ever be satisfied with whatever
you've done. Go Ahead.
There is another thing to do,
other than all done before.
There is another thing to do,
other than all done before.
Are we filled up again?
That's my job!
A weed is all you need.
This is good.
Recently, in an ancient Byzantian library...
...as i was idly leafing thru an old book,
i came across a story.
I takes place a long time ago in ancient
Greece...
...on the isle of Crete, where a monster
was terrifying the people.
A wise man called Daidalos saved
the isle from the monster.
Now in time, the king began to think:
"What if this man one day locks me up
in the dungeon, too?"
I would better act before he does!
So he shut Daidalos...
...and his son I karus in the dungeon.
Daidalos ve I karus knew there was
no way out of the dungeon.
Gazing out of the one small window at the
precipice...
...below the foamy waves breaking on the
wild rocks...
...he lost all hope.
One day he saw a flock of wild geese over
the sea.
Suddenly A bright hight went thru his brain.
Trapping geese...
...he plucked all their feathers.
Gluing them together with wax,
made a pair of giant wings.
He tied these wings securely on
his son I karus and...
...said to him:
Listen, my son, listen carefully
to what I say.
Don't fly too low.
The humidity from the water will wet your
wings...
...weight them down and you will fall
into the sea.
Don't fly too high either...
Or the sun will...
...melt the wax from your wings
and you'll fall down.
So from my experiences, I would say,
moderation is best:
Always take a middle course.
I karus threw himself from the window and
freed at last from the unescapable dungeon.
He keep on flying and flying.
He keep on flying and flying.
But...
...in the joy of flying like a bird,
he forgot his father's advice.
After soaring higher and higher...
...the sun melted the wax from his wings.
The feathers came apart and...
...I karus, like a big, plucked bird...
...fell into the foaming waves of the sea
and was lost.
Would he dare again to fly?
They do not move their wings up and down
like this. They move them forward.
How can they stay in the air, then?
Look!
The wind!
Hey, Ýstanbul!
Blood for blood.
My subjects, what do you want?
The head of those...
...responsible for the murder of Hüsrev
Pasha.
Why do you act like this?
They are my bosom friends...
Is there no other way
to settle this conflict?
I can't give you those heads.
Of course, you can! Or we will
think of another way to settle it.
Blood for blood!
You have the Prime Minister's seal.
As the first assignment, you will behead
all those dogs out there!
My Sultan, those people out there are
all brave soldiers...
...they have often risked their lives
for the Ottoman State.
Their very rebellion now stems from their
concern for the well being of the State.
Permit to tolk to them before
I take up my sword.
We want blood for blood!
Abdi Agha, come near me!
It is allright.
Send the men away.
They are dispersing.
How distant do you think
the moon is from the earth?
You'll find out when you get there.
Do you think I can get there with those
wings you will make? You fool!
Even when the birds can't fly to the moon!
How do you know the birds
can't get to the moon?
A scientist never presumes, Hasan.
He measures, weighs, calculates, proves.
To your health, my Lord!
To our health.
Shall I tell you once again what you must do
to preserve your good health?
Are you crazy Musa?
Would I give this beautiful head of yours
to those mad dogs?
I would gladly sacrifice this head for you,
my Lord.
Come Pasha, come
and sit by me here.
My lady...
Don't be impatient, Recep.
Our work is not done yet.
As long as you have this passionate
ambition...
...you will always get your way in the end.
I've given birth to savage like Osman
and a lunatic like Ibrahim.
So Murat is a child's toy for me
Neither my parent, nor my family
and even if...
...God himself were to stand between me
and my sovereignty.
God forgive me!
Come my Recep,
it is time for work.
First, we must finish our work.
50 coins and no more.
70 and no less.
Greetings, Ýbrahim.
What is the problem with that girl?
I guess she owns that box.
What is inside the box?
I don't see what you find in these infidel
scripts.
This is my job.
Bekri!
Bekri!
Wke up, you big lush!
What's up fellow?
Is it the end of the world or what?
Stop asking questions.
What are you talking about,
what is happening?
Come on, Bekri,
get up, will you!
I'm not going anywhere.
What's the rush, Evliya?
Live each moment fully, enjoy life.
And you know what Khayyam says.
You blind! That earth, that heaven,
those stars are all vain.
Leave this and that and
live to your heart's conrent.
In this forever dissolving and evolving
universe...
...all you will ever take is
a breath which also is a vain.
All right, Bekri.
You win.
You always have an answer to everything.
Is all this rush just to get
these papers to our friends?
They are not just any papers, Bekri.
Look at them!
I found these papers
in the Slaves Bazaar.
This Algerian pirates who plundered the
Venetian ship, sold these papers in Istanbul.
Hasan, this fellow seems to have found
the solution to the riddle puzzling us.
We must have them read.
What language is it?
All knowing Evliya, tell us
what language this is?
I can't make it out either.
We'd better show it to our Venetian friends.
Come on, then!
Let's go see our friend Antonio.
Child, we just got here.
Let's take our breath first.
The sky is overcast, there might
be a storm tonight.
We may not be able to see the stars.
What I am trying to say is that
now we are on this island.
Whatever happens around us, happens...
Never you mind, do not care.
Never miss a moment.
Live it to the full. Neither fear the future,
nor dwell upon the past...
Murat, my son!
You will be the grandest sovereign
inheriting this...
...empire sprawling on 3 continents.
The reign over it well, you must have loyal
men around you, not cowards and traitors.
Neither Musa Chelebi, nor Mustafa,
nor Hasan Caliph is traitor or coward.
May be not, but your soldier don't like
seeing them around you.
Who will govern this country, mother?
I or the military?
What is the meaning of these remarks?
Get Musa for me!
They can't get him, my son!
Musa isn't in the palace. He's gone.
Gone?
Where can he go?
Doesn't he know those bloodthirsty dogs
are lying in wait for him?
Where is Musa mother?
At Imrahor.
Under the observation of Recep Pasha.
I'm ready.
Who ordered? Who is the Sultan?
Of course, you are, my son.
You were only 11 years old when you
become Sultan.
We used to take all the important executive
decisions together.
No, mother, not together.
You always made the decision by yourself.
Then what is changed now, my Murat?
Musa is done with.
Good.
Musa is taken care of.
Now it's Murat's turn.
Where is Musa Chelebi?
Recep Pasha, how did it go?
Your orders are executed my lady!
What order?
What is this all about?
Yes, my son Murat! As before,
I personally made the decision.
Fearing your emotions might err you and
thinking the safety of the epire...
...I got a decree from the Chief of Islam
authorizing the execution...
...of Musa Chelebi, Hasan Caliph and the
Chancellor of the Ex chequer Mustafa Pasha.
The decree has been carried out.
Don't cry. Henceforth, your soldiers
will fully trust you and Recep Pasha.
Thus we will strengthen unity and
peace in the Ottoman Empire.
No!
No, mother!
You limping Bully! You'd better prepare
for your last player on earth!
No, my Lord! As God is my witness,
I swear that...
...I never went against my sovereign's will.
Get up, you infidel! Guards!
My head to be sacrificed for you!
Allow me to pray one last time.
Do you think your sins will be absolved
with one prayer, you dog?
Hasan! Eureka!
What do you want?
Look, do you see
how the oar goes in the water.
Forwards and backwards like this.
Like the wings of birds
forwards and backwards.
You have ruined my lovely dream.
Tell us what you were dreaming?
I can not.
Why not?
Because I have promised.
Whom have you been promised?
My sweetheart in the dream.
You clown! I almost took you seriously.
What is wrong with what I say?
How serious can your promise
to a phantom be?
How do you know she is just a phantom?
What if you yourself in somebody's dream.
How come Murat has not closed this inn?
Even the Genoese hadn't closed it.
How can Murat touch it?
Was this inn a drinking place even during
Genoese times?
No, it was a court house then.
It became a wine cellar
in Byzantian times...
...and a drinking house under the Ottomans.
Come in, young fellows.
Don't you fear the Sultan?
Why should we fear him?
I guess you are not from Istanbul.
Murat's prohibited alcohol drinking.
Haven't you heard?
Yes, we have heard that but...
They say Murat beheads on the spot
anyone caught drinking.
I have got immunity, young man.
They can't touch me.
What is the immunity you speak of?
Cross the soldiers palm with gold, feed the
janissary aghas well...
...then you, too, can drink to your heart's
content.
This Istanbul, my friend,
you give and you take.
And is Murat unaware of this?
How could mama's boy?
All he does is fool around with girls in his
Harem.
Meanwhile here we go on enjoying.
Even see him?
What does he looks like?
I saw him once.
He is just a scrawny adolescent.
Hey, stop, young man!
Stop it!
Hey! This is Murat.
Yes, indeed it is Murat!
My Lord, with due respect, when the people
of Istanbul wake up tomorrow morning...
...seeing the corpses hanging on the trees,
they will be intimated enough.
Please, by your leave,
let's call this massacre off.
But we've just started, Pasha!
Now let's go over to the other shore of the
Golden Horn...
...and see how the people there are
honoring the Sultan's law.
How strange!
I wonder what this silence is all about.
Strange! Apostol's inn is also closed.
Agop, it is us. Open the door.
It's us, Agop.
Why don't you open?
What's happening?
Who are we hiding from?
So you've turned your wine cellar into a
pub?
That's typical Greek mentality!
What do you think, you clown?
What's the Greek mentality like?
If I hade your Turkish mentality,
there'd be water in your cup now...
...instead of this ravishing wine!
So, Sultan Murat is walking around the
city in disguise...
...and taking lives like the Angel Of Death.
I only hope to God that Bekri can keep
out of trouble.
Take a sip, gentlemen.
On the sea everything must be shared.
Sonny, slow down!
This stuff is not as innocent as it looks.
But there is a way to enjoy everything.
Go slowly.
Savor the taste.
Tell me what life is all about!
You brat! I said savor it,
not gulp it down.
What a hothead!
Look at my face, fisherman,
see if you can recognize me.
How should I recognize you, lad?
Or did those two sips of wine go to your
head?
You are going too far!
Don't be angry gentlemen.
Anger is harmful.
Look at the beauty around you.
Live, my lad, live!
Alright, so I could not recognize you.
Forgive me and tell me who you are.
I am Murat, fisherman, I am Murat.
Which Murat?
Murat the fourth!
Give that damn thing back to me!
If you drink some more, you'll be telling me
that your companion is Duce Mehmet.
What did you say to them?
If you are Sultan Murat the Fourth,
then I am the emperor of China.
Hush!
Search everywhere!
Yes! He poured it in here!
You little kitty!
Let's go.
Stop, Evliya!
That's enough!
Ahmet, do something!
He's gone!
What have you done!
You've killed him!
You little rascal!
Forgive my soul.
God! I must be getting old.
God! What is this?!
Uçmuþ bunlar be.
Baksana adam neler anlattý.
As Agop told, the fellow's sworn
re establish law and order in Istanbul.
But what a way to establish
law and order!
Going on like this, he'll only
establish the hatred of people.
You just wait and see! Tomorrow all the
people will be worshipping Murat!
That is the mentality of the shepherd.
Instead of separating right from wrong
he just kills off everyone.
Who cares? Let him kill.
We shall all be dust in the end anyway.
Exactly! Life is short. I want to enjoy it,
not live fearing death.
Why do they always prohibit
what is joyful?
Drinking coffee and wine, laughter
and loving are forbidden.
If I can't enjoy these things,
how am I different from this hanged man?
Greetings, gentlemen!
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
Gentlemen, you were all talking so bravely.
But now you look Ike you have seen a ghost!
You dare laugh at us, lad?
I will show you what a ghost is!
This is my Murat, fellow,
Murat the Fourth, himself.
The youth in the boat?
Exactly! The youth in the boat.
Is this the time to play jokes on people?
You little fool!
You're right. But, suppose that
I really am the Sultan.
And I confront you and say:
"You foolish men, have you
not heard of my decree?"
We'd say, yes, Sultan,
we have heard of your decree.
We know all about your orders.
But as Khayyam says:
You hold the decree while we hold the
hearts...
...we're more sober than you
in this drunken state.
You drink human blood where
we drink the blood of grapes. "
Have a heart.
Which one of us is more wise?
Come on, get moving.
So, my Sultan, would you
like to come with us?
If you stop calling me Sultan.
Fine with us. We won't say it again.
Now let's go.
You walk ahead, I'll catch up
with you in a moment.
Shall we take them, my Lord?
No. I'm going with them.
But what should we do with these?
Kill them off.
You are at the root of this trouble.
What trouble do you mean?
The papers from that Italian ship.
The drawings of wings.
He insist that it's impossible for
a man to put on wings and fly.
How can you be certain
if you have not tried it?
Are your arms a like wings?
Of course not, this I know.
If I put on wings...
Can you flap them like a bird?
I will experiment. Why shouldn't I succeed?
If the birds can do it...
If you do so, the nerves and the blood
vessels in your arms will get tied in knots.
How do you know?
Do you see?
What do I see?
How can you say so without seeing
nerves and blood vessels.
Shall I cut my arm and
show you my blood vessels?
Why should we cut yours?
Whose shall we cut off then?
Thanks to Murat the Fourth!
Hasan come here.
I'm holding him. You untie the rope.
I'm releasing him.
Why do you laugh?
Why do you laugh?
Come on, get up.
Take a drag, my lord
Sultan Murat the Fourth!
Bekri! You promised!
Alright, lad. Don't get angry. You don't
take my jokes.
Enough is enough, Bekri! He is right.
Sultan is no joke!
He has had half the people of Istanbul
executed!
How true!
What kind of a man can he be?
Does he feel no remorse at all?
What do you say, lad?
How do I know?
I guess, he must feel some remorse.
It can't be easy to have so
many people killed.
Bo they live by themselves in this huge
house?
Do they have a family?
None! He lost his whole
family during the plague.
All Ahmet has is his sister Leyla
and this crazy Hasan.
I see.
And what are they going to
do with this dead body?
Nobody can understand
what those lunatics do.
They obsessed with flying like a bird.
But, what has that to
do with the dead body?
They are rying o find out the difference
between the structures of birds and humans.
But, isn't it a sin in our religion
to cut up dead bodies?
Answer me! Does our religion allow
such scientific studies on dead bodies?
God forbid!
Our religion orders us to surrender the
dead to God...
...who gives and takes lives in the world.
Even though some physicians have
the cunning inclination...
...to practice their art on dead bodies,
this inclination is evil temptation.
I see. How do we punish
those who commit the sin?
With death penalty.
Have you gone to sleep?
Have they been deciphered?
The news isn't good.
In all Istanbul, I couldn't find anyone
who could work out these writings.
Considering the Italian ship, I first
went to Antonio Pasha. No use!
Couldn't it be Spanish?
So, I run to Gomez Aga. No!
Armenian? I asked Artin
Efendi. No luck.
But Itzak Efendi says it is not Jewish.
Nobody can decipher this writing!
How far you've cut
this cadaver!
What shall we do know?
I did my best.
Another bad news.
Antonio Pasha told me
that Gaileo's recanted.
You do not say!
What did you expect?
After all the torture he endured
from the Inquisiton!
They were going to behead
him if he did not recant.
If you are a man of silence how can you
recant?
I would like to see you if it is
you to be beheaded?
Whatever the odds are, a scientist never
gives up.
If you give up your scientific studies
on human bodies...
...and also your idea of flying,
our Sultan will pardon you.
Otherwise you will lose your heads.
Give me an answer.
Turn them over.
Quick!
Turn them over!
Repent you sinners, repent
so that I can pardon you!
Hold on tight, Hasan.
We are flying away!
Damn it!
You Devil spawns!
If it were up to me...
...I would send you to the
other world without trial.
But our sovereign Sultan
has decreed a court trial.
What is this about?
This had never occurred to me!
You, Ahmet Cemshid, also known as
Hezarfen. You, Hasan also, known as Lagari:
You are conducting medical
experiments on cadavers...
...and intending to fly like birds.
Do you have anything to say to this?
We are trying to work out the secrets of the
human body.
Think of a physician, my lord.
He gives his patient a drink of
health giving herbs.
Doesn't this amount to experimenting
with the human body?
If it cures, he will give this
same drink to other patients.
What do you say to this, Chief Physician?
When you experiment with living patient
you can get their consent.
Did you get the cadaver's
consent for the experiments?
Now let's take this matter
of flying like a bird.
Has the Almighty God
given you wings? No!
Then the wish to put on wings and
fly is defying God's will, isn't it?
Almighty God didn't give us wheels.
But mankind has invented
and used it for his travels.
God gave us neither wings nor wheels.
But he gave us brains so that we can think.
Enough, you impertinent man!
Do you mean that I have no brains?
Not at all, my lord. I am referring to
those who are...
...unable to use the brains
that God gave them.
When we use our minds and knowledge,
mysteries are solved...
...mankind progresses and our sufferings
lessen.
Sir, of all the nonsense you sprout,
only the following make sense:
"The mind that Almighty God granted us".
But, people like you use your minds
to serve your...
...personal pleasures
instead of serving God.
Therefore you do not deserve to
have your lives spared.
Instead of being good subjects of Islam...
...they are bad seed who deviated
from God's purpose.
My loard...
...each seed is created differently...
...as a unique individual whereupon the
community is formed.
Individual is the essence of the community.
Wasn't our prophet Mohammed an
individual too?
You impertinent fool!
Stop profaning the sacred name of our
prophet!
What do you mean by saying the
individual is essential?
The individual exists for the good
of the community and the State.
You must not ask what the State will do for
you, but what you can do for the State.
Otherwise there would be chaos, as
everyone would have something to say.
Let them!
Is that bad? Mankind progress
only thru the personal...
...progress of each individual's mind.
Therefore, my lord, let everyone
have something say!
Ne demek o? Then, what would be our use
and the use of our laws?
To provide written proof that the
strong one is right!
Think of two people before the law. Who gets
justice? Not the rightful, but the powerful one.
As the weak one has no power,
the strong one changes the law.
Are you aware that with these blasphemies
you are denying the laws of God as well?
My lord, we only believe that we should
use the mind...
...granted to use for the benefit
of mankind.
Instead of trying to fly like birds why
don't you use your brains...
...to invent a new weapon that will make our
armies victorious against our enemies?
That's exactly what we are doing!
How so?
The great Sultan Mehmet had to struggle
many years to be able to conquer Istanbul.
Because the city was surrounded
by wals and the sea.
Ans what of that Sultan of Sultans,
Süleyman the Magnificent himself?
He who made the Ottoman Empire the
greatest...
...the most widely spread
kingdom on the earth!
He couldn't conquer Vienna
despite the siege for years.
Because Vienna is very well protected
by walls and mountains!
Lmagine that our soldiers could
soar over the walls of Vienna.
They would suddenly see our soldiers
flying above and...
...dropping barrels of gun powder on them!
While the infidels run around
like chickens...
...we would capture the city from within.
Victory would come from the sky!
Oh my!
But this is Murat!
This is Murat,
the lad in the boat!
From now on, no more experimenting
on dead bodies. Understood?
Understood, my lord.
As for the flying...
...go ahead!
Funny Lagari!
You are so funny!
Tell me the story about the winged
soldiers again.
We take young children training them
to fly adeptly.
As they grow up and become expert birds
we send them off to fly over Vienna.
One day the people of Vienna look up and
they see a sky full of flying soldiers.
Our birds ignite the gun powder barrels they
carry with them and...
...drop them on the enemy.
Then they fly back to get more ammunition
and once more return to the Vienna Skies.
Stop! Let me take a breath!
So, why couldn't you fly yet?
We are still experimenting.
I see.
Is there anything you need?
There is, my lord.
We have some ancient scripts which
we can't decipher.
These papers belong to a Venetian slave.
We would like to find her.
Who and where is she now?
We don't know, my lord.
She is almost dead.
Come, let's take away this table.
I won't give up my room.
Who wants you to? Get up!
I'm on top of a bald mountain.
A flock of birds with bright
red feathers are singing me...
...to sleep with songs lovelier that the
nightingale's trill.
Meanwhile, inside the mountain a worm,
how shall I describe it...
resembling the worms that gnaw at apples,
but of giant size...
...is gnawing away at the rocks.
While I am lost in sleep that whit, slimy
fat worm comes out of the mountain peak...
...and opens it's mouth to swallow me.
At that moment the beautiful
birds songs die...
...and the red birds are changed into
a flock rooks...
...mocking me with their cawing.
Time and time again, I woke up just as
I was about to be swallowed by the worm.
Chief Astrologer, what do you think
this dream portends?
It does not bring pleasant
things to mind, my lord.
Nevertheless, there must be a lesson
that can be learned from it.
Come to the point!
The important thing is to find out what the
dream portends and to take the precaution.
Those pretty red birds...
...must represent the Devil, my Sultan.
The cawing of the rooks, following
your being tricked to sleep...
...must be the Devil's laughter.
Is your opinion the same?
I agree with the Chief
Astrologer, my lord.
The mountain in your dream
must be our Ottoman Empire.
The giant worm must represent
the traitors...
...who want to destroy our empire
from within.
Conspiring with the infidel, the Devil
tried to charm you to sleep.
But...
...you have much a might and...
...that you open your eyes
in time to prevent...
...the destruction of yourself
and your empire.
Yes, my Sultan.
It is not a good dream.
But it is good that
you've dreamed it.
The angels have sent you
this dream to warm you...
...that the Devil will be tempting you
in a charming guise.
Otherwise he is already attempting
to deceive you with his guiles.
There we are.
Drink this too.
Good for you.
Your fever has started to go down.
You, in a one corner of the world...
...and me, in another corner.
We have been involved in the same
thing. Strange!
But then, why should it be strange?
How beautiful!
