"God is dead,"
declared Nietzsche.
In his place
the amoral superman,
his actions limited
only by the strength…
or weakness of
his own character.
So, when we consider
Raskolnikov's actions in…
"Crime and Punishment,"
we have to ask ourselves,
"does he fail
because he is weak?
"Or because there are, in fact,
"inherent limitations
on human behavior…
built into man's
spiritual programming?"
Dorothy, how are you doing?
I'm great. Just great.
What a beautiful suit.
Who's the lucky guy?
What guy? I'm meeting
my father for lunch.
You're not meeting this mystery
man I keep hearing about?
I gotta go.
How do these rumors get started?
Can you wait a minute?
How are they?
Perfect.
I'll take them.
Sorry I'm late.
You look beautiful.
So do you.
Let's go before someone sees us.
Wait for me.
You're so paranoid.
You worried about my father?
I'm not, I'm just being careful.
He's not the CIA, Jonathan.
How do you know…
he doesn't have another private
detective following us?
Relax, he's not gonna try
another stunt like that,
not if he ever wants
to speak to me again.
They're closed.
I can't believe it.
They're closed
between 1:00 and 2:00.
Jonathan, didn't you check?
Look, the woman on the phone
said they'd be open
between 12:30 and 1:30.
I'm positive.
We've got 25 minutes. Oh,
what are we gonna do?
It's a great view.
Look, you can see the campus.
See?
I told you.
Come here.
Look at this.
Oh.
What I wouldn't give…
to see my father's face
when he finds out.
Won't it be great?
No more sneaking around,
no more hiding.
You haven't told anybody
about us?
Of course not. Not
even your sister?
I haven't told a soul.
I guess I am being
a little paranoid.
Who wouldn't be
with a father like yours?
What's he gonna do
once we're married?
Cut me off?
Big deal.
It's ten to, you know?
We should get back.
We've got plenty of time.
Careful!
What's wrong?
It's a foot wide.
You sit on a bench
a foot wide, you don't fall.
It's not the same thing.
Sure it is.
Come here.
What?
Oh, come on, you're being silly.
What?
Don't be afraid.
I've got you.
Jonathan, let me down.
In a minute.
New shoes? Yeah,
I just got them.
You gonna let me down?
I'm sorry, Dorrie.
What?
You only have yourself to blame.
Ahhh!
Everybody back.
Everybody back!
All right, get back!
Mr. Carlsson,
is it true that your daughter
committed suicide?
No comment.
When was the last time you
spoke to your daughter?
Is there any connection between
this and your wife's suicide?
Did your daughter leave a
suicide note, Mr. Carlsson?
"When I am dead, my dearest,
"sing no sad songs for me.
"Plant thou no roses at my head
nor shady cypress tree.
"Be the green grass above me
with showers and dewdrops wet.
"And if thou wilt, remember,
and if thou wilt,
forget."
It certainly suggests
a morbid state of mind.
That is her handwriting,
isn't it?
Yes, but it still doesn't mean
she committed suicide.
She mailed this yesterday,
probably right before she…
She typed the address. Why would
she want to kill herself?
It doesn't make any sense.
Ellen, don't.
I don't want to prejudge this,
but quite frankly,
Miss Carlsson,
suicide is the most
likely explanation.
The press has had
a field day in the past.
I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your
investigations to a minimum, lieutenant.
Sir, I'm gonna do everything
I can to help you with this,
but there's gonna be some kind
of an investigation in a case…
A formality, lieutenant,
given the facts.
I see no reason to intrude
on the family's privacy
at a time like this.
Thank you, commissioner.
I appreciate your cooperation.
Within ten years of
arriving from Denmark…
after World War II,
he built Carlsson Copper into one of
the largest corporations in America.
Boy, all that bread…
and the kid still goes
and kills herself?
Nothing's that bad! I would
have helped her spend it.
Shut the fuck up!
What's eatin' you?
I'm trying to listen.
I'm so sorry.
With the acquisition of extensive
mining interests in Brazil
and the takeover
of Jerusalem Steel,
Carlsson became one
of America's richest men.
The success in his business…
Two Big Bens and
a side of fries.
First, there was the suicide
of ex-wife, Louise,
that was followed by the death of
only son, Bobby, in an auto accident.
I remember him. Wasn't he
dating Brooke Shields?
It was Isabella Gianelli,
if you really want to know.
Isabella Gianelli.
What was she in?
She wasn't in anything, Joanne.
Her father happens
to own half of Italy!
Her father owns Italy.
Get with it, Joanne!
This is Carol Mahoney for WNJ,
reporting another sad chapter..
In the troubled family history
of copper baron, Thor Carlsson.
And now for an update
on the Carlsson case,
we go back to Carol Mahoney
outside of police headquarters.
Carol, what's happening there?
Yes? This is
Thor Carlsson.
I'm still standing outside
police headquarters, waiting…
I'm going to take
this in the other room.
I won't be a minute.
Carlsson is in the hotel with his daughter
Ellen, the dead girl's twin sister.
Yes?
I'd appreciate it if we kept
this between ourselves, doctor.
I do understand your problem.
Yes, Dr. Wilder,
let's not beat about the bush.
If there's anything I can do
to show my appreciation,
if not for you personally,
then for your clinic?
Thank you, doctor.
You've been very understanding.
Who's
Dr. Wilder?
Were you listening at the door?
Dad, I'm not a child.
What are you trying to hide?
You don't understand!
Understand what?
Dorothy was pregnant!
Pregnant?
She never said…
Exactly! Maybe she didn't
want to bother you.
Bother me? Maybe she thought you
were too busy looking after vagrants
to have time for
your own sister.
You are really something,
you know that?
Dorothy was a whore, Ellen!
Like her mother!
Jonathan?
Jonathan?
Jonathan?
What happened? What do you mean?
The bank. You never showed
up for your interview.
Why do I want to go work in some
shitty little bank, anyway?
It's been four months
since you graduated.
Four months.
16 weeks!
Son, you cannot rest on your
laurels forever, you know.
Yeah, I know. I'm giving
it some thought, okay?
That's very well,
but don't you think it's
time you did something?
Look, for God's sake, I said
I'm giving it some thought.
Get off my back!
That's what your father
always used to say.
Well, like father, like son, right?
Jonathan…
I'm gonna turn out as useless
as him, so get used to it.
I don't want you to waste your potential.
Is that so terrible?
Does it do harm because I
want you to better yourself…
Jesus Christ, no wonder
he ran out on you
if this is the way
you kept nagging him.
Fucking nagging!
Shame on you.
Shame on you.
Look, I'm sorry, Mom.
I said, I'm sorry.
Mom?
What turns you on about guys?
I like it when guys have a few
small moles on their upper back,
around their shoulder area.
I'm sorry, Mom.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Sometimes it just seems like
I go on and on at you…
but it's because
I love you so much.
And I just want you to show 'em.
Do you understand?
All the sacrifices that we made
so you could have
that scholarship.
What is it all for if you're
just gonna sit around and mope?
Trust me.
I'm gonna make you
real proud of me, Mom.
That's a promise.
Where are you headed?
New York.
Come on in. It's your lucky night.
Great, thanks.
I just got back from
two years on the road, myself.
India and Thailand,
the old hippie trail.
Amazing time over there.
Incredible dope.
I've been on the road
since I was a kid.
My father was a diplomat, so I
never stayed in the same place.
Always moving, here and there.
Right.
You remember a Korean 747
got shot down by the Russians?
My parents were on that.
I remember that.
Both of your parents?
That's terrible.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no.
That's all right.
My name's Jay…
Faraday.
Jonathan, Jonathan Corliss.
Nice to meet you, Jay.
I just mean isn't there
somebody that you could stay with?
I'm not going back.
I'll just run away again, okay?
Mickey…
so how are you going to live?
You just going to beg,
hustle, steal, what?
How long do you think you
can survive that way?
Shit, I don't know!
Why do you keep asking
all these questions?
Because they're
important, Mickey.
Right, right.
This is Castle House.
Yeah. No.
I won't be here, but
Jay should be around.
You can talk to him about it.
Dave!
Thanks, Sue.
Is that an offer?
Baby, you look wrecked.
I am wrecked.
Sometimes I just run out
of things to say to them.
Go home and get some sleep.
I can't.
I'm going to Philadelphia.
Ellen!
I know, I know.
It's just something
I've got to do.
What do you think you're
going to accomplish?
It's been almost a year
since she died.
If I could prove she didn't kill
herself, I'd feel less guilty.
Yeah.
Just don't be bummed out if
it doesn't work out. Thanks.
I'm a big girl.
I'm going to be at the
Marriott if you need me.
Thanks for taking my shift
on the van tonight.
No problem.
At least I get to spend
the night with lover-boy.
See you, Cathy.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Lieutenant,
thank you for coming.
You didn't give me
much choice, did you?
I gotta admit, you picked
a strange place to meet.
Well, don't worry. There won't
be a repeat performance.
Look, Miss Carlsson, I don't
have time for games.
I've got a job to do,
and it's not an easy one.
So if you've got something
to tell me… Okay.
Dorothy did not commit suicide.
She was murdered.
You got evidence
to back that up?
Look what I found.
It's Dorrie's. I was
going through her things.
So?
They're getting married
in the drawing.
And another thing,
did you know that she was
wearing new shoes that day?
She bought them at a store
four blocks from here.
And there's a marriage
license bureau
three floors below
where we're standing.
I'd have thought even
your averagely dumb cop
could get a handle on that one.
You think you're
pretty smart, don't you?
Well, for your information,
I checked the license bureau.
Every appointment that
was made that day was kept,
so no way in hell was
your sister getting married!
Right, but she didn't know that.
The fact that there
was no appointment
only proves he had no intention
of going through with it.
So the guy didn't show up. That's all the
more reason why she threw herself off a roof.
Except for the note.
Why would she write a suicide
note if she was getting married?
I think she was set up,
and the note is what proves it.
Lieutenant, my sister was
not the type to commit suicide.
I knew her better than anyone, you know.
We were twins.
There's no motive.
Who'd want to kill her?
I don't know, but
somebody got her pregnant.
It didn't just happen.
What are you afraid of?
Is my father paying you off?
You know, this may come
as a shock to you,
but your father's money
doesn't buy everyone.
No, only the Philadelphia
Police Department.
Goodbye, Miss Carlsson.
I just have the feeling that
she was going to get married.
She never said anything?
No, not to me.
But then, we were never
really close friends.
So you didn't know
she was pregnant?
No!
God!
Any idea who the father
might have been? No.
She was supposed to be
seeing someone,
but none of us
ever knew who he was.
She was real careful after
that thing with your father.
What thing?
She was seeing this guy
the year before, a student.
There was a rumor that your
father had him investigated
by a private detective. What?
But they stopped
seeing each other anyway.
Maybe they didn't
stop seeing each other.
She'd really keep it secret if she
was still seeing the guy. Yeah.
Do you remember his name?
No, but he used to work
in the Law School Library,
and I think he still does.
He was nice looking, tall, dark.
He was kind of a hunk.
Anything wrong?
You look like you saw a ghost.
You must be Dorrie's sister.
Right?
What's going on?
She didn't jump, did she?
Why should she? She thought
she was getting married.
Married?
To who?
You were the father of
her baby, weren't you?
Just hang on a second.
I didn't know
Dorrie was pregnant.
I hadn't seen her for over six months.
I wasn't even here that term.
You weren't?
Where were you?
I was in therapy.
I had kind of a breakdown.
Okay? You
satisfied now?
I stopped seeing her
at the end of the fall.
That's when things started
getting a little heavy.
Your dad having us followed
by a private detective,
Dorrie putting all this
pressure on to get married.
She wanted to marry you, too?
I can't believe this thing
she had about getting married.
I think it was a way of getting
away from your dad's control.
So who was this other guy,
the one that got her pregnant?
I saw her with someone once,
after we broke up,
at this real out-of-the-way club
Dorrie and me used to go to,
way off campus.
As soon as she saw me,
they left.
He could be the one.
You know his name?
No, but his face is familiar.
I think he was a student.
I've got a yearbook
back at my place.
Wait here, okay? Why
can't I come in?
I've got this cranky landlady.
She doesn't allow girls
in the room after 10:00.
Trust me. Jesus. What do
you think I'm going to do?
Fly out the back window?
The cases that
we've been seeing…
have been homosexual in nature.
Whether or not you agree
with my assessment that…
You have a
teenage daughter, right?
Do you know whether
she's sexually active or not?
What's the idea of banging
on the door like that?
Waking up half the neighborhood?
What's the matter with you? I'm sorry.
I'm waiting for Tommy Roussell.
For Christ's sake! He
went in ten minutes ago.
And there's no reply.
Something must be wrong
with the bell.
There is never anything
wrong with this bell.
Tommy?
Tommy?
Are you there?
Tommy, dear?
Are you in there?
Please, something's wrong.
I keep a key to every room.
House rule.
If they don't like it,
they can lump it.
He left a note.
We found that book
open on his desk.
"When I am dead, my dearest,
sing no sad songs
for me."
I'm sorry. I guess
we owe you an apology.
At least I proved
she didn't kill herself.
Okay, take her away.
Let's go.
Let's go.
No, I'm going to bed now.
Uh-huh.
No, really.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
Bye, Dad.
Hello.
Hi.
Come on up.
Hi.
Jay.
You know, I was
really worried about you.
You were? Taking off like that.
Yeah.
Cathy told me about
what happened. Jesus!
Who do you think you are?
Cagney and Lacey?
Hey, I didn't do so bad.
Well, you just promise me,
next time you'll
take me along, okay?
We're a team, remember?
Okay, partner.
Get some sleep now.
Mm-Hmm.
Mmm…
What are you doing?
Watching you.
Don't you wanna get in with me?
You looked so peaceful, I didn't
want to take advantage of you.
Come on.
Take advantage of me.
Oh, baby.
I was at Columbia
and Dorrie was at Penn.
We hardly saw each other.
And then, my brother died.
I'm sorry.
I was a total zombie.
I didn't get
out of bed for weeks.
The only thing that kept me sane
was working with the kids.
I understand.
I never told you this,
but I lost both my parents
in an accident.
What happened?
They were on the Korean 747 that
was shot down by the Russians.
Oh, my God.
I had no idea.
That's okay.
I was an only child.
My father was a diplomat.
So we moved around a lot.
They were my best friends.
We make a great pair, don't we?
Talk about accident-prone! Yeah.
A couple disaster areas.
It's crazy out tonight. Mmm.
Look, it's Rose.
There goes Rose.
Whatcha got? We got
crack, uppers, downers.
We got sandwiches!
We got oranges. Listen,
this is where we are.
If you need a bed for the night,
we can take you with us now,
or you can show up later.
Doors are open day and night.
Man, I'm hungry.
Move outta my way!
That's Rose, isn't it?
Rose?
Rose, it's okay.
We're here.
Let me look at you.
Oh, God, we've gotta
get her to a hospital.
Dr. Shelley,
please call extension 4-1-1.
She's got broken ribs, a broken
jaw, and a serious concussion.
We're gonna have to
keep her in for observation.
This one got insurance?
No.
Didn't think so. Don't worry,
I'll pay for the charges.
Again! Must be nice
to play Mother Teresa.
This'll do, right?
This'll be fine, Miss Carlsson.
Thanks.
She's gonna be back on
the streets doing more crack
just as soon as she can walk.
Look, we do what we can.
Sometimes it's not enough,
but it's better than nothing.
Somebody's gotta
take care of these kids.
It's just sometimes
I get so depressed.
You feel okay?
Sure.
I mean, about us.
I know that's what you mean.
I feel good.
So do I.
Go, go, go.
Steal!
Keep going.
Safe!
Mmm… happy?
Yup.
You've blossomed, you know.
It's not just your hair.
It's everything. I know.
It's great. Finally found
the right stuff, huh?
I did, didn't I? Yeah.
You deserve it.
It was time you had a break…
after all that crap you went through.
Don't remind me.
How long have you guys
been together now?
Six months?
Almost a year.
Mmm… must be
some kind of record!
Jay is different from
anyone I've known.
He's got this strength.
He really knows who he is.
And the kids adore him.
Yeah, who wouldn't?
I'm jealous as shit.
Foul ball!
I bet he's a great lay, too.
Cathy!
Well, isn't he? As a
matter of fact, he is.
I hate you. I do. No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
Your ears must be on fire.
Yeah. Nice things, I hope.
You'd blush if I told you.
Yeah, well, I'm a nice guy.
I deserve to have
nice things said about me.
Mm-hmm.
And so modest.
That's what I love.
I'm gonna throw up!
Hey, we gotta get going.
What time is it?
What's the hurry? I didn't
say we'd be there till eight.
Well, I got to get
showered and changed.
Are you serious?
Yeah, let's wrap it up.
I don't know why you want
to put yourself through this.
Well, I'm gonna have to
meet him sooner or later.
Why?
He's your father. So?
I just want everything
to be out in the open.
Look, it really doesn't matter
what my father thinks.
We don't get along,
we never did get along,
and we never will get along.
Yes?
Ellen, you're here.
Hi, Daddy.
This is Jay Faraday.
It's great to meet you, sir.
How do you do, Jay?
Very well.
Very well, thank you.
Can I offer you a drink?
Uh…
Scotch on the rocks, please.
Ellen?
No.
I just came by to
introduce you to Jay.
I'm on duty tonight.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Sorry.
Come up to Bedford one weekend
if you can spare the time.
Bring Jay!
Sure. Bye.
Bye, Ellen.
I'll see you tonight?
Yeah.
Okay.
I caught that little fellow
up in Maine.
That's a golden carp, isn't it?
That's right.
King among fish.
Yeah.
It's my vice…
hobby…
whatever you want to call it.
Yeah, I used to fish quite a bit
as a kid with my father.
Really?
Yes.
Fishing was his great passion.
I remember…
watching the sun come up
and waiting for the first bite.
So…
whose idea was this meeting?
Does it mean
what I think it means?
Well, we are pretty serious
about each other, sir.
Uh, and I… I wanted to, uh…
May I speak frankly?
Please, go ahead.
I know the relations
between you and Ellen
haven't been so great
for a while.
That's something she regrets.
It's certainly something
that I regret.
Is that so?
Well, I don't know whether
Ellen told you or not,
but I lost both my parents
when I was 19 years old.
They were aboard the Korean 747
that was shot down
by the Russians.
I'm sorry to hear that, Jay.
I had unresolved differences
with my father,
and I never had the chance
to square them up, and
I always regretted that.
I just don't want Ellen
to make the same mistake.
I know how much she cares
about you underneath.
Ellen is very precious
to me, Jay.
She's all I have left.
She's very
precious to me, too, sir.
I wouldn't want
you to think I intend
on spending the rest of my life
doing what I'm doing now.
It's very rewarding work,
but ultimately
my ambition lies elsewhere.
So if you're worried about me
keeping Ellen in the manner
to which she's accustomed,
as they say,
I don't think you need have
any concern on that score.
I'm ambitious, determined,
and I'm not afraid of hard work.
Well, you seem like…
a serious young man.
Well, I am.
And I'm very serious
about your daughter.
Hi. We're not in right now,
but if you want to leave
a message for Ellen or Jay,
please leave it after the beep.
Thanks. Bye.
Hi. This is
Patricia Farren.
I hope you remember me.
I think I know who Dorothy
was dating when she died.
And I'm gonna be in New York
for a few days.
I'm about to catch
my flight, so…
Patricia, hi. It's Jay.
I'm Ellen's boyfriend.
Oh, hi. Ellen had
to go out of town.
I know she'd love to talk
to you. Where are you?
I'm in I.A., but
my flight's at 7:00,
and I'm gonna be
staying at the Hobart.
Hobart. Okay, listen, have you
told the police about this?
No, I wanted to talk
to Ellen first.
Yeah, great. I think it's best
if you don't at this stage.
The police haven't been too cooperative
in the past. Yeah, I know.
Listen, are you going to be in
tomorrow night around 6:30?
I'll make sure I am. I'll
have Ellen call you then.
That'll be okay?
Okay.
Bye.
Who is it?
Bellman.
Aaah!
Come on, open up.
Chick, did you hear that?
Yeah, I heard you
pulling the nails out.
Certainly.
Go ahead.
What are you doing in
there with the lights off?
Hey, McDougal!
Now we're in trouble.
Hide that thing.
Hurry up.
You need some help there?
No, that's okay.
I got it.
Hey, hey. Let me give you a hand.
I got it.
I'll push and we'll
get it through the door.
What you got in there?
A dead body?
I can take it from here.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

Happy?

Have a great time.
Be happy.
Pumpkin?
Yeah?
Honey, what's this?
They're Dorrie's.
She was wearing them
the day she died.
Don't you think it's time
we threw this stuff away?
I don't like to.
Babe, the bad times are over.
It's all ancient history.
Okay?
Remember, dinner tonight,
7:30, with your father.
Oh, God, do we have to?
I'm not in the mood for him.
I think it's the least
we can do, honey.
After all, he did
buy us this apartment.
Yeah.
Now, very gently,
I'm going to draw the bait
off the lily pad
and let it float down.
That's the great thing
about carp.
They know they're being fished.
They know you're there.
You have to outsmart them.
These guys live for 40,
50 years in one place.
They get to know
every nook and cranny.
We could sit here for weeks
and not get a bite.
I hope you weren't too bored. God, no.
On a day like this?
It brought it all back for me,
those times with my own father.
You see, I've been thinking
about what we were
talking about last night.
We're modernizing
our two Pittsburgh works.
If you're serious
about wanting a job, Jay,
I could find you something
to cut your teeth on.
You'd be like
my personal assistant,
if that sounds interesting.
Sounds great, but I'd
have to discuss it with Ellen.
Of course, I understand.
You know something?
You remind me a lot
of Bobby, my son.
He had your enthusiasm.
Thank you. I take that
as a great compliment.
I had high hopes
for him. High hopes.
But things have been pretty
rough for this family, Jay.
People talk about
the Carlsson curse.
Sometimes I think they're right.
Well, things can change.
Maybe.
But anyway,
I appreciate the way you've
tried to bring us together.
Heal the rift.
I believe in the family.
I think it's the most
important thing there is.
You're right, Jay,
absolutely right.
I just want to
try something different.
This is my chance
to do something on my own.
Can't you see my point of view?
I'm trying, Jay.
Ellen, everything we have,
everything we own…
This fucking car…
Comes from your money.
How do you think
that makes me feel?
So you're gonna take a job
with my father?
I don't see the difference.
Honey, there's a big difference.
Sell the apartment
if it makes you feel better.
I never wanted it
in the first place.
I don't want to sell
the apartment.
I like the apartment.
Does that make me
such a terrible person?
It's just not what
I thought you were about.
This has nothing to do
with what I'm all about.
What is it with
your father and your mother?
I mean, there is his side
of the story after all.
She did have an affair.
You don't know
anything about it.
What she went through
for years with that man.
So you just
stay out of it, okay?
Okay, fine.
I'm sorry.
I never said I was gonna
take the goddamn job anyway.
Ellen Faraday?
Yeah.
Detective Michaelson, Homicide.
Homicide?
Mrs. Faraday, do you have
any idea where she could have gone?
No, I don't.
I see.
Was she good friends with you?
No.
Was she very close to your sister?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
Dorrie never mentioned her.
When was the last time
you saw her?
The last time I saw her
was in Philadelphia
over a year ago.
I see.
So that was definitely
the last time you had any
communication with her? Yes.
Hi.
Hi.
What's going on? This is
Detective Michaelson.
This is my husband, Jay.
Detective Michaelson.
Mr. Faraday.
I'm investigating the
disappearance of Patricia Farren.
Your wife's name was in her diary.
Who's Patricia Farren?
She knew Dorrie at Penn.
I met with her.
She was one of the last people
to see Dorrie alive.
Do you recall a woman
phoning the apartment
asking to speak to your wife?
About four months ago?
May 7th…
to be exact.
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
I never actually met
the girl myself.
I appreciate that.
Thank you for your time.
No problem.
If you do remember anything…
Of course! And I'm sorry
we were unable to help you.
Bye, now.
Good night,
Mr. Faraday.
Take care.
Well, don't you
think it's weird?
What? Patricia Farren disappearing,
maybe even murdered.
It's too much of a coincidence.
People disappear.
My name was in her diary on
the same day she disappeared,
with my telephone number!
Like she was gonna call me.
But she didn't call you,
did she?
Maybe she found out something
about Dorrie, though.
Ellen, we know
who killed Dorrie.
It was that guy
who hanged himself.
What if he didn't hang himself?
What if he wasn't
the one that killed her?
Babe, you're gonna drive
yourself crazy
if you keep going on like this.
You keep going around
in circles.
You gotta bury the dead
and let them be.
If I'm right, the
killer's still out there.
He killed Tommy Roussell
and then Patricia Farren!
If it's gonna make you
feel any better,
pick up the phone and call the
Philadelphia Police Department.
That's a waste of time. Jesus Christ!
When are you gonna stop?
I'm sick of listening to
your neurotic fantasies!
For Christ's sake, grow up!
Madeline!
Madeline.
Madeline.
I'm sorry. I don't know
what's wrong with me.
It's okay.
I had no reason
for yelling at you like that.
You forgive me?
I forgive you.
Hello?
You're still there?
Yeah, we're running late.
What about the movie?
Let's see.
We can still catch
the 10:00 show.
Okay. You come by and pick me up?
Sure.
Don't let me down!
I won't let you down.
Okay, I'll see you.
I love you. Bye.
Bye.
Oh, shit!
You missed her.
She left already.
She waited and she went
to the movie on her own.
Oh, Christ!
How are you, Cathy?
You look good.
We should all get together
for a little dinner, huh?
Sure.
Oh, hi, honey.
I'm really sorry.
I fell asleep at the office.
Fucking Pepe
peed on the rug again.
We better change that
cat's name to Pee-Pee.
I knew this would happen.
What?
Face it, Jay.
You're at the office
all day, most evenings.
I'm at the shelter almost every night.
We lead separate lives.
That's not true.
Yes, it is.
Ellen, will you
hang up your coat?
I mean, what's the fucking point?
Look,
things could be a lot easier
if you quit your job.
Quit my job?
I love my job!
Why should I quit my job?
You're the one who's changed.
I haven't changed. Of
course you've changed.
I'm the same man you married.
You're right. We haven't been
spending enough time together.
But it's gonna change,
I promise.
You're always making promises, Jay.
But I mean it.
You're the most
important thing in my life.
I won't let anything
come between us,
not even my career.
A career.
I never thought of you
as someone having a career, Jay.
Come here, Sam.
Sam, what you got there?
What is that, boy?
Hey, Sammy.
Sammy, what?
Aaah!
And he said, "The world
is giddy with democracy."
In the severed head case,
police have identified
the victim as Patricia Farren.
Miss Farren checked into
a New York hotel a year ago
and was never seen again.
Hello?
Is this Mrs. Roussell?
Yeah.
Sorry to bother you. I got your
number from student records at Penn.
I'm a friend of Tommy's.
Tommy's?
What do you want?
Did Tommy have
a breakdown three years ago?
Let me get back to you
in 15 minutes.
I'll call you back.
Come on in.
Congratulations on your marriage.
Thank you.
I called the police department
thinking you'd still be there.
I quit. I got fed up
with all the politics.
What brings you to Philadelphia?
My secretary said it was urgent.
I don't think Tommy Roussell
killed my sister.
He wasn't even here at the time.
He was having a breakdown.
I spoke to his
mother this morning.
Maybe she doesn't want
to admit her son's a killer.
You know, nothing was gonna
stop this kid from coming here.
I mean, just because
he was under treatment.
I mean, he wasn't
in an institution.
I don't think she's lying.
What are you saying, that your
sister committed suicide?
No.
Someone else killed her.
The kid hanged himself.
How are you gonna explain that?
If I'm right, he was murdered.
All right, look,
for argument's sake,
let's say Roussell didn't
kill your sister. Who did?
Dorothy's boyfriend,
the real one.
The one that got her pregnant.
Tommy Roussell knew who he was,
but the guy got to him before
he had time to talk to me.
Now Patricia Farren's dead.
And I think she knew
something, too.
Don't you think it's
one coincidence too many?
Well, phase three
is right on schedule.
We'll be switching over
to the new computers next week.
So we can go ahead with our trip as
planned. You've done a good job, Jay.
You've more than justified
my faith in you.
Well, thank you.
That means a lot to me.
Is Ellen coming with us?
Well, I'm not sure.
I'm working on it.
We're still very much
a family business.
I think it's important
to emphasize that.
Well, I don't foresee
a problem, Thor.
Good evening, Mr. Faraday.
Thank you.
You mean no one
saw her with anyone?
Well, not since
she stopped seeing Roussell.
I find that pretty
hard to believe.
She was very careful after your
father hired that private detective.
Where do we go from here?
To tell you the truth,
I don't know.
I've done all I can.
I feel bad taking more of your money.
Well, thanks anyway.
How much do I owe you? Don't worry
about it. I'll send you the bill.
It won't be more
than about $1,500.
Does that include the
check I gave you? No.
Okay.
I'll mail it.
Thanks, Dan. We tried. Yeah.
Okay. Bye.
Jay!
I wasn't expecting
you home so early.
What happened?
Your hair.
Oh.
You don't like it.
No, no, no.
I just…
It's just strange.
I think it looks great.
I felt like a change.
Blondes are supposed to
have more fun, aren't they?
No, no. You look great.
You look really great.
Listen, I thought we'd
get out of the house tonight.
Go out to dinner.
I work tonight.
I told Cathy you'd be taking
the night off. You did?
They're beautiful.
Thanks.
Who was that on the phone?
Nobody.
Wrong number.
I'm flying down to the plant
with your father next week.
Why don't you come along?
I've lived this long
without seeing…
the inside of the copper works.
This new process…
is the most modern
of its kind in the world.
It's really special.
You ought to see it.
Send me a photo.
Hey, that reminds me.
I have something for you.
What is this?
Open it up.
Wow!
Look inside.
I love it.
Put it on.
What have I done
to deserve this?
Put up with me.
For that, I deserve
the whole store.
You're not so bad.
You know what I would love?
I would love for us
to take a nice, long trip
to somewhere really exotic,
like up the Amazon.
Something like that.
Really? I think
that's a great idea.
You mean it?
Let's get going.
I haven't finished my drink.
Let's get going now.
I'm not feeling too hot.
We have 20 minutes.
Now!
My stomach. What's wrong?
We can go home.
Jonathan.
Jonathan Corliss!
I'm sorry. I think
you've got the wrong guy.
It's me, Terry.
Terry Dieter!
Name doesn't ring a bell.
Jonathan and I used
to be at Penn together.
We used to work in this shitty
restaurant. Remember this?
"Give me three
Big Ben platters?"
This is Pam, a close
business associate. Hi.
I've never seen you
before in my life.
Jonathan, stop playing games.
Get your fucking hands
off me, asshole!
You better watch who you're
calling an asshole…
See you in court, pal. Let's go.
See you in court, Jonathan.
Ivy League graduate,
ladies and gentlemen.
What is going on?
I can't stand jerks like that.
Well, you didn't have to hit him.
I didn't hit him.
I'm sorry. Let's not
let it spoil the evening.
The guy was an asshole.
By the way, your hair,
I don't like it.
It makes you look cheap.
Thanks!
Thanks a lot!
Hello?
Hello, is this Mrs. Corliss?
Speaking.
Jonathan's mother?
Yes.
I'm a friend of his.
We went to school together.
Do you have his address? I'd
like to get in touch with him.
Hello?
Are you there?
Jonathan's dead.
He died 3 years ago.
Hi.
You okay?
God, you scared me.
I thought you were having
dinner with my father tonight.
I was worried about you.
I called you at the shelter.
They said you weren't feeling
well, so I tried you here.
No answer.
I felt better.
I went shopping.
What did you buy?
Nothing. I didn't see
anything I liked.
I'm starving!
Your hair looks nice. Does it?
Yeah.
Hey, look, I'm sorry
about last night.
I know you're upset about it.
I'm not, honestly.
No? You seem…
distant.
I'm just tired, that's all.
Damn, we're out of pretzels.
I have this craving for pretzels.
Pretzels?
I'm going to go get some.
Need anything?
No!
Ellen, what's wrong?
Nothing, Jay.
I love you very much.
You know that, don't you?
And I need you.
Everything's fine.
Don't worry.
Go to your dinner. Okay.
You've reached Dan
Corelli. I'm out of town for a few day.
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.
Otherwise, call my office
at 555-2929.
Dan, this is Ellen.
I need you back on the case.
I think I know
who killed my sister.
All they ever
found was a pile of his clothes
and a note.
He just swam out to sea
and never came back.
He said he was sorry.
He didn't want to hurt me,
but he felt that his life
was such a failure
that he didn't have
the strength to carry on.
They never found his body.
That's what makes it so hard.
If I could have just given
him a proper burial, you know?
Damn trains!
You get used to them in the end.
I'm sorry.
This must be
very painful for you.
It was such a waste.
He was such a kind,
and gentle, and loving boy.
He said his father
was a diplomat.
A diplomat?
No, no.
His father was an accountant.
And one day, he never came home.
That was 16 years ago.
He never got over it, you know,
his father running out
on him like that.
And this…
this is his room.
I'm sorry I have to rush off,
but I have to show
this house at 2:00.
Thank you so much for seeing me.
I really appreciate it.
Oh, well…
thank you.
You know,
it really helps
to talk to somebody
who cared about him.
I did. I cared
about him very much.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, my God.
So, how's my mother?
Very sad.
Very lonely.
That was a terrible thing
you did to her… Jonathan.
I know, but it was necessary.
Necessary?
Look, Ellen, I had a dream.
I did what I had to do.
I didn't flinch.
Carnegie, Rockefeller,
men like your father,
you think they got there
without breaking a few eggs?
And Dorrie?
Why was she necessary?
Dorrie and I had it made.
Then she went and ruined it
by getting pregnant.
And I couldn't risk
your father disowning her.
I couldn't allow her
to destroy all my plans.
How did you get her
to write the poem?
She was always
giving me little poems.
She was so romantic.
Tommy Roussell?
Patricia?
Jay Faraday? I suppose you
killed him, too, right?
It was fate, Ellen.
It's all down to fate.
I mean, there I was,
my future fucked.
And along comes this guy…
an orphan,
an only child, no one
to report a missing person,
a whole new identity.
You know, I'm not religious,
but sometimes it's hard not
to believe in a higher purpose.
You did all that for money?
No.
It wasn't the money.
I don't think you have any idea
what the Carlsson name
means to me.
We could have been
happy together
if only you'd let things be.
But it's your father
I feel sorry for.
He doesn't need this,
another tragedy.
We'll both mourn you together.
I'll be a great comfort to him.
Ellen!
Come here! Come here!
Ellen.
Hey!
Hey, Miss!
Come back.
