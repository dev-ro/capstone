He's coming...
The malicious man is coming.
Who is he...?
One with a figure, and yet without a figure...
He is with a soul, and yet, without a soul.
He is, frankly, the
personification of absurdity.
He's coming...
Izo is coming...
Stop right there, Izo!
I am a vengeful spirit that was killed
miserably by your lawless sword.
Saya... Saya...
Learn the agony that was
etched into my very core.
Damn you, Izo...
How can you be so brutal...?
Are you brutal because you're human?
Or is it that...
...you're human because you're brutal?
Brutality is from the lesson of life itself.
Where you are going
and what do you want?
I want vengeance...
What do you want to have vengeance on?
Everything that exists.
Everything that exists...
So, where are you going?
To the stronghold of the repulsive rulers.
And when you get there?
Divine retribution!
I was hired by those people, so
I'm not going to let you pass.
What a pain...
Is dying such a painful task?
Pain is proof of your existence.
Did I ever exist?
What have I existed for?
You exist, and you'll die.
What is that for...
Izo, it's you, isn't it?
I've waited for ages.
Izo...
Why did you leave me?
It was us, you and I, who
made love so passionately.
It was just my instinct for sex.
Nothing special, a natural act.
How are you going to make up for...
...my rage and grief from
conceiving a baby and drowning it?
Your vagina felt good, but smelled horrible.
It stunk.
Even a cat or dog might have liked it...
..but I am a human after all...
You are not a human.
Izo, I will curse you forever...
...even if hellfire burns me to ash.
Rage is proof of your soul.
Bear it all to the depths of hell.
Izo.
Are you still running this
devilish road by yourself...
...and can't just peacefully
return to the afterworld?
Why don't you just quit this
pitiful struggle and linger here?
Why don't you?
If a horse comes, we slay the horse.
If a human comes, we slay the human.
If a devil comes, simply...
...we kill the devil.
You are a disgusting vengeful spirit.
You, the minions of a fraud...
You, a revolting dead soul.
Time for judgment.
You, sordid half-dead, I
will send you back to hell!
You destroy the flesh and blood of
man and, likewise, call your own ruin.
Kneel down before the gods, sinful one.
If you do so, your barbarous soul filled...
...with resentment and malice,
may be blessed with some mercy.
You fraud.
What do you rule?
What do you create?
Step back!
Sinful one, bow your head before god.
Then, summon that 'god' you say.
If there really is that sort of
existence, make an appearance of it!!
You, fool.
God won't make his grand
appearance in front of a fool like you.
Frauds, like you, create the existence
of something that doesn't exist.
There is no god! You are the
worst fraud in existence!
Insolent man!
You are irredeemable.
Stay back, you who dares
disturb my meditation.
Who are you?
I am the mouthpiece of god...
...and the evidence of his greatness.
You are shit.
It hurts...
The descendant of my very own blood...
I'm glad you've made all the way here.
You are the response of my
thought that I left in Mitochondria.
I...
I am the mother of all mankind.
Come here...
...with all of the natural, inbred lust in you.
Fuck me as hard as my womb will bear.
Come.
Fill me full of vigorous blood, my child!
The Archbishop has been killed, sir.
Barbarians.
By any chance, they won't
get roused, will they?
Premier, that's the main
concern of us financiers.
Please do not worry.
Those rebellions are castrated and
controlled by our law manipulation...
...as if they were as tame sheep on a farm.
As for that theory...
It's constituted by our erudite scholars
with their wide range of wisdom.
And even if these didn't
work, and in case of riot...
...the great army under my
authority will subdue them at once.
This perfect collaboration
of we, the governing class.
This spotless cooperation is what weaves
graceful history in past, present, and future.
Isn't that correct?
Then, as for the archbishop...
There shouldn't be any problem if we make
the next hierarch take over the position.
Constraint of domination and oppression
is an intrinsic nature of human operation.
Izo is coming...
...with his body fully filled with fury.
Who is Izo?
'Who' is merely a vengeful spirit.
'Who' is an existence that
goes against us aristocracy.
Namely...
...'who' is an unknown disruption in
the system that appears occasionally.
Where is he!?
Izo will flow out in the system.
Izo is what's unacceptable.
Izo is a loathsome nonsense.
I don't know what you're looking
for, but anyway, it's meaningless.
It's so futile.
You'd better learn how
to reach a compromise.
Absurdity?
What about that?
Simply the pathos in your mind is the
principal cause of everything for you.
Exactly.
Well, excuse us.
We haven't introduced ourselves yet.
We are from the company that's selling...
...vacation houses for your
rich post-retirement years...
Hell is in your heart...
Salvation is nowhere in the world.
My blood is gushing out...
Izo, where are you going?
Where are you going?
Don't go!
You can't go. You can't leave me.
You can't leave me, who gave birth to you.
Killing your mother means killing yourself.
Izo!
Repent.
Guilty of being against human morality.
Guilty of being against god.
Guilty of existing.
What about you, who lies about
the existence of nonexistence!
Where is this?
Who... am I?
Izo!
Mr. Kanpeta is calling you.
History is written in blood.
Human history is nothing but
a chain of bloody events.
Thus, know that a new age will come
only from massacres and bloodshed.
Say, Izo...
What is revolution!?
'What' is to slaughter people!
That's too clean...
Killing people one after another!
You are born killer!
A killer in the form of a human!
Yes, sir.
I am a born-killer...
Has the filth disturbing a
phase not yet wiped out?
It will happen soon.
Why is he so strong?
This imperfect incoherence...
It is that the phases are the
more imperfect, the stronger.
Every phase happens
because they are imperfect.
A perfect phase creates
imperfection to remain perfect...
...and produce the phase of absurdity.
The imperfection that drips out of perfection
is the fundamental nature of existence.
In the first place, existence itself is absurd,
namely, the fundamental incoherence.
How long does it take for the
imperfection to be perfect?
An eon of evolution...
Then finally, humans would
rise to the level of gods?
That's too clean, Izo.
Killing one after another...
Mr. Yamada, what is love?
Yes.
It is a word.
A word does not necessarily accompany
with the fundamental nature of its meaning.
It is a code of sounds, sometimes...
Then, tell us about democracy?
Yes.
Democracy is a by-product of
human civilization; an illusion.
Has human civilization rightly evolved...
Okay then, Ms. Sato, what is a nation?
Yes.
A nation is a vicious delusion
exists only in human minds.
It is an imaginary notion of falsehood
only there to control and...
...govern people that
instinctively gather into flocks.
It is the basic principle of the fiction
that requires one side to be sacrificed.
Well done.
We're done for today.
Stand up.
Bow.
It is hell to live.
But it is hell to die too.
One sunny day, the mate of a crow died.
On this beautiful day, the
gods are all weeping...
Is he a minion of Kanpeta?
Hate is something that is everywhere.
Grudge is not only the root of life
but also the mother of destruction.
Destruction is familiar...
...but life is unknown...
Thus, we are unknown...
Then, we are mere illusions.
All life is simply illusion.
Why is that man weeping?
It's because he's killed too many souls.
Why does a man weep if
he kills too many souls?
He hasn't been killed and died.
If a man slays too many flesh
and bones of the living...
... his blood starts to flow out
from deep in his heart, too.
Is that painful?
Yes it is.
It is as painful and tormenting as those
souls of those who have been slain.
Where will this man go?
What will this man do?
He's going to a place where the
meaningless are to find meanings.
He is pitiful. I feel sorry for him.
All souls are pitiful.
Why is he looking so sad?
Because he's lonely.
Why is his face looking so painful?
Why doesn't he just be happy
and smiling, like how we are?
It's so pathetic that he's deluded...
..so he thinks he can reach all the
answers if he just questions them.
Let's laugh at him.
To the back.
Kill him! He's a useless maggot!
Don't let him get away!
What skill.
I'll show you my first-ranked sword skill too.
You're Izo, correct?
Who are you?
I don't personally have any grudge
towards you, but I need you dead.
Die!
You are so pathetic.
Why don't you just give up.
You won't ever find what you're looking for.
You're so fuckin' dumb.
I'm going to crush your head
and smash your stupid brain.
Get him!
Why are you you?
For what reason are you you?
What the hell are you talking about?
You dumb ass.
Stupid fucker.
Saya, look after the house.
Fight well for our country.
Take good care of yourself.
Yes.
Is that you..?
Your face...
Saya. I'm back.
What are you? Why are you following me?
I'm the tally of your soul.
I was destined to meet you.
You? The tally of my soul!?
I am the tally of your soul...
...who was destined to meet
you but couldn't meet you.
I was craving to meet you...
...and unfulfilled...
A man's soul and a woman's
soul are supposed to be one.
Then, souls can endure all the
loneliness, desperation, and desires.
I don't know you.
I am always alone.
We, the two souls that were supposed
to meet, finally can't meet...
...though we were destined
to meet one another.
Why...
How would I know?
But I don't care any more.
We are here together now.
Whatever.
Come in.
I have just heard from our scout.
That Izo has been transforming...
Transforming... Izo...?
Yes.
His figure is nothing but the figure
of a devil, if there ever was.
Excellency, what exactly is Izo?
Hate is the soul of a devil.
A devilish appearance
is only suitable for him.
Even we must be anticipated.
