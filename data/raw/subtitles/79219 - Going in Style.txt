How come you're
always feeding them, Willie?
You know, they say they bring disease.
Never brought me no disease.
Look, don't get me wrong.
I'm not one of those guys who's
got it out for pigeons. I like them.
It's nice to have a little nature around.
It's just that I heard they cause disease.
Yeah... well.
Yehh!
What the hell's the matter with this kid?
If he eats any more jelly doughnuts...
...they're gonna have to take him
to kindergarten in a moving van.
Look at that mug.
Got one of them heads
they make piss pots out of.
Get the hell out of here.
Too much excitement for one day.
I'm telling you.
I'm sick of this shit.
Yeah, but it beats getting
hit in the head with a dull ax.
Yeah?
I wonder about that.
Ah... let's go home.
Checks are probably in by now.
Jesus Christ. $49.
Who's using all the lights?
Don't look at me.
Al?
What?
Don't "what" me.
Every time you get up
to take a leak at night...
...you forget to shut the
light off in the bathroom.
What are you talking about?
I don't ever turn the lights on.
No wonder the seat's
always wet in the morning.
At least I don't forget to flush.
What are you trying to say?
I never forget to flush.
All right. All right.
I'm sorry I brought it up already.
Let's forget about it, ok? Come on.
Nothing to start fighting about.
It's only a couple of dollars.
I'll be with you in a minute.
~ There are tears in the eyes
Of the regular guys ~
~ New York ain't New York anymore
It's sad ~
~ New York ain't New York anymore ~
I should've bought a house right
after the war when I had the chance.
You all right, Joe?
Yeah. I'm ok.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
You haven't eaten much lately.
That could be a sign of something.
Nah. Just haven't had an appetite.
What?
Nothing.
- You sure you're ok?
- Yeah.
Just thinking about things,
that's all. You know.
All right.
237...
times 36.
Thanks.
Thanks.
A little more water.
That's good.
Thanks.
How do you feel this morning, Al?
Pretty good.
Willie?
All right.
Well, that's good to hear.
Me, on the other hand, if I got to
spend another day doing nothing...
...but sitting around in that park looking
at them ugly kids, I'm going to go nuts.
How would you...
...how would you guys like
to go on a stickup with me?
What was that?
I said, how's about we all go on a stickup?
It's foolproof.
If it works, we'll be in great shape.
If not, maybe they'll give us three years.
Maybe.
That would be free room and board,
and when we get out...
...we'd each have 36 social
security checks waiting for us.
That, by the way,
adds up to 8,532 bucks...
...apiece.
Not a bad piece of change.
Maybe we could all put it together and buy
one of them newspaper and candy stands...
...in one of them big buildings in Manhattan.
Friend of mine's son bought him one.
Lives pretty good.
But what the hell am
I talking about that for?
That's only if we get caught,
and I don't think we'd get caught.
Well?
Well, what?
Well, what do you guys think?
I don't know.
Sounds like a great idea.
Willie?
What do you mean,
it sounds like a great idea?
I don't know what you're talking about?
Are you talking about
actually doing this or what?
Yeah, actually doing this.
Do you hear what you're saying?
Look, let me tell you something, Willie.
I got to look back
and say that my life was ok.
I got my share of everything but money,
and the guys who went out for that...
...some of them got it today,
but they put too much time in getting it.
Whatever.
That's history.
Right now, here we are,
and I ain't complaining...
...but things would be a hell of a lot
easier, if we had a little extra cash.
And besides, what the hell could we lose?
Either we get the money or we get caught.
We're winners either way.
I did some stealing during the war,
so I'll set everything up.
What do you mean,
you did some stealing?
Never mind what I mean.
Hello, Mrs. Fein.
Oh, how are you boys?
You're looking great.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Thank you. Goodbye.
We're going to need some guns.
I don't believe this.
Willie, we're going to need your help.
But I respect your feelings.
If you don't want to go, you don't have to.
But I want you to know
you'll still be our partner...
...and we'll cut you in on everything,
that is if it's ok with you, Al.
- Of course it's ok with me.
- Good.
Yeah, and if you go to jail,
am I still gonna be your partner?
Through thick and thin, for better or worse,
you'll always be our partner.
Listen, my nephew Pete is a gun nut.
He's got a small collection
he keeps in a cabinet in his basement.
Well?
I'm going over there to watch his kids
this afternoon for an hour or two.
- I'll check it out.
- Great.
But, Al, make sure you
don't say nothing to nobody.
Of course I won't say nothing to nobody.
Good.
Don't worry about a thing, Willie.
We're going to make you feel young again.
Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
It's all set.
We got no problems.
We've got
four pistols.
You want rifles? We got rifles.
Pete's got a couple of rifles, too.
- No rifles.
- All right, we got four pistols.
Now, one of them is one of those, uh,
heavy machine, uh, german...
One of those heavy german machine pistols.
I don't think that's too good, you know?
I think we could do without that,
but the other three are perfect.
Good. Do you think you'll have any
problem, getting them out of there?
Joe...
piece of cake.
When all this is over,
we'll give your nephew some money.
But everybody remember, if we get caught,
we don't tell where we got the guns, right?
Of course not.
- What are we going to stick up?
- I was just thinking about that.
Uh, might as well make it a bank, right?
- I guess so. Might as well.
- Willie, what do you think?
You're asking the wrong person.
Well, I think a bank would be pretty good.
We might as well go all the way.
Besides, I think they're insured
for this kind of thing anyways.
Not one in the neighborhood, though.
They know us there.
Tomorrow we'll take a ride
into the city and look around.
Must be a million good banks there.
Going to come along with us
for the ride, Willie?
Yeah.
No funny stuff.
No funny stuff. Serious stuff.
Feels great to be doing something, huh?
You said it.
Jesus.
Don't anybody work up here?
They're all out walking.
You know, I haven't been in the city
since I stopped driving the cab.
Boy.
It's been a long time for me, too.
I forgot how many beautiful women
there are around up here.
A lot of good they're going to do you now.
I still kind of like to look at them.
Boy, this place is beautiful.
Well, what do you think?
I don't know.
What are we looking for?
I don't know.
But I kind of like this one, though.
What do you think?
I guess it would be all right.
Willie, what do you think?
It's sure nicer than the one
in the neighborhood.
Well, looks good to me.
There's only one guard.
We ain't going to do better than that.
Should we call it this one?
Well?
Yeah. I guess so.
- Might as well.
- Good.
Uh, Joe... you think we maybe
ought to look at some more?
Nah. What for? A bank's a bank.
What are we going to do
about all those cameras in there?
That'll be no problem.
- Onions?
- Nah, better not.
- Come on, live a little.
- Come on, live it up.
Ok, onions.
Everything on mine.
Uh-uh. Put that away.
These are on me.
By next week, we'll be going out
for chinese food every night.
Joe...
...do you really think
this is going to work?
What does it matter?
I feel like I'm 40 again.
Hey!! Boy.
Well, I tell you what.
We'll take a gypsy cab there and
tell him to wait while we go inside.
Those gypsy cab drivers don't keep
a record of where they go or what.
We'll act dopey and
give him a good deal.
He won't figure 3 old guys
can be up to anything.
And just to be safe...
we'll take a bus to corona first
and maybe we'll take the cab from there.
That'll make everything harder to trace.
Boy, you must have done
some stealing during the war.
A stickup guy I used to know
a long time ago told me...
...that the most important thing is to
put fear into everybody right away.
So when we get in there,
let me do all the talking.
When do you want to do this?
When do you think you can get the guns?
Anytime.
Could you get them today for instance?
I guess so. Sure.
Oh, if that's the case,
then we might as well...
...go back there tomorrow
and make our withdrawal.
No sense in waiting around, right?
I guess not, huh?
They look like they'd be a little too warm.
You probably can't breathe
too good through them.
Probably can't see too good
through them either.
I think these would be pretty good.
Easy to carry around,
easy to take on and off.
Whatever you say, Joe.
You recognized me.
Boy, won't the kids, uh, love these?
Yeah.
Kathy?
- Hey, how are you doing, Al?
- Pete.
Come on in.
I was just on my way out.
What are you doing home
in the middle of the day?
I'm taking an early shift at the station.
I picked up a job at night bartending
up in the Bronx. Come on in.
- All the way up in the Bronx, huh?
- It ain't so bad.
Hardest part's getting my
fingernails clean enough...
...to tend bar after
working on cars all day.
- Hi, Al, how are you doing?
- Pretty good, dear.
- Sit down. Want some coffee?
- No, thanks.
I can't stay too long.
I was just walking by and
thought I'd drop in say hello.
Hello, uncle Al.
Look, I'm sorry, but I've
got to run out right now.
Are you gonna stay for dinner?
No, thanks, Pete. Not today.
I've got to meet Joe and Willie soon.
Ok. Well, I'll see you later on, then.
- Good bye.
- See you tonight, sweetie.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
- How's my beautiful princess today?
- Good.
Been a good girl?
- Yeah.
- You're always good.
Why don't you show uncle Al
the pictures you drew?
They're upstairs.
- Did you draw some pictures?
- Yeah. They're upstairs.
- Think I might be able to see them?
- Yeah.
- Do you want me to come upstairs with you?
- Yeah.
Ok. What are we waiting for?
Let's go.
Up! Wait for me.
Wait for me, honey.
Go ahead upstairs.
I'll be up in a minute.
Go ahead.
Ok.
He must've had a million kinds of bullets.
I didn't know which were for which guns,
so I took them all.
I figured, we'd figure it out
when I got home here.
Are we gonna use
real bullets?
Willie, if we don't do this thing right
and we get caught...
...the bleeding hearts
in the city will put us on probation.
And this whole thing can only wind up
costing us a fortune in subway tokens...
...going to see some probation officer.
After the stickup we're gonna
have to get rid of our clothes.
So wear something you can throw away.
These are very attractive.
- You pick these out, Willie?
- As soon as we get into the bank, Al...
...I want you to hold your gun on the guard
while me and Willie collect the dough.
We'll have them fill up
that airline bag I got.
I figure that ought to hold
a nice couple of dollars.
Then we'll get out of there fast,
get back into the gypsy cab...
...but instead of taking it
all the way back here...
...we'll get out and hop
into the subway.
That'll help confuse
everything. Any questions?
What if we get shot?
What's the difference?
Yeah, Willie, what's the difference?
What's the matter,
Willie?
Can't sleep.
Willie,
what's the matter?
Well...
I had a dream about bobby, my oldest son,
when I spanked him once when he was little.
I don't even remember
what the hell it was all about.
What could it have been?
Come home from work, my wife tells me
he did something wrong, whatever it was.
So I ask him, why he did it.
He says he didn't do it.
So I crack him across the rear end,
and I ask him again.
He still says he didn't
do it, whatever it was.
So I crack him again.
I was young at that time.
I didn't want to let him get the best of me.
Can you imagine that?
I kept smacking him across
that little rear end of his...
...till finally he said, "yeah, yeah."
Whatever the hell it was, he did it.
Then he ran to the bed...
...put his head in the pillow...
...wouldn't look at me.
We never had any fun after that.
He only lasted till he was 18, that kid.
I never got the chance to explain.
Willie.
Come on, Willie.
Get some sleep.
No wonder the big tube we bought
a week ago is practically gone.
You don't have to use that much.
Willie...
...we're gonna be rich in a couple hours.
Leave me alone.
I don't know if I'm going to shave.
You going to shave?
Joe... are you shaving?
No. I'm pouring coffee.
I mean, are you shaving this morning?
I'm not gonna shave.
You can shave if you want to.
Nah. What the hell for?
Nope. This is too big.
Too big, too big.
- Look at this one.
- Too small.
- Here.
- Yeah?
- No.
- No, that's a small one, too.
Let's see.
Yeah. That works.
Yeah. More like that.
- Well, let me see that. We'll match it.
- Right there.
Lookit, that's it,
right there.
Good.
- Good.
- Here's another one like that.
Too small. Willie's doing
a better job than you are.
- Well, Willie's in the way.
- Yeah.
- All right, Willie. No, that's...
- That's good.
- That's a big one.
- It is? Let me see that.
No, it isn't. It's perfect.
Good. Good. Good. That's it.
That's not it. Let's start again.
- Let's start from scratch.
- The bank will be closed.
My, don't you look snappy.
I used to wear this when I was bartending.
Here. Put these in your pocket.
Which one do you want?
Don't make no difference to me.
No. Button
your top button.
- Oh.
- Right there. That's it.
- Am I ok?
- Fine. Can you see mine?
- Looks fine to me.
- Me, too.
Ok, then.
Let's get going.
Could we go over the whole
thing one more time?
If we go through this again,
I'm really going to get nervous.
Don't you worry about a thing.
I'll be watching out for you.
Just stick by me and stay loose.
That was quick.
- I didn't know you could whistle like that.
- Haven't done it in a while.
How you doing today?
Me and my friends would like to know...
...how much you'd charge to take us
to Manhattan and back?
One of them got to go to a bank
on 36th and Broadway to sign a will.
He'll only be there for a few minutes.
The guy's already waiting there for us.
$30.
It'll be $30.
Gee, that's a lot of money, but ok.
- This is where you want to go, right?
- That's right.
Ok. Come on.
You make a move, and my friend will blow your
brains out. And don't think he won't do it.
All right, this is a stickup.
Touch them buzzers,
and we start blasting.
I want everyone out here
to get down on the floor.
And you back there, start pushing
that money through them windows.
You've got to be kidding.
That's better.
No nonsense, and no one gets hurt.
- What does his secretary got to do with it?
- I don't know. I think she's got kind...
You! You! You!
Hey, I'm talking to you, both of youse.
Get over there! Sit down.
Come on! Get over there!
That's better.
Now just sit tight,
and don't get any bright ideas.
You got me?
- What?
- Nothing. Help me fill up the bag.
Now put it all in here. That's it.
That's it. Both hands.
That a girl. Keep going. Good, good.
Right there, that big bundle.
Good. You did a nice job.
Tell your boss to give you a raise.
- Thought we were kidding, huh?
- Let's go. Help him.
That's it. Help him.
Good, good.
Let's go. Right there.
Put it all in. That's it.
Right, right, right.
Good, good. Love your hairdo.
Now, I want all of you to lie down also.
And make it snappy!
You, too. Down.
I guess that's it.
Let's get out of here.
Ok, let's go!
There you go. Keep the change.
I've got
the tokens already.
Here. Open this bag.
That's it.
Al.
Al!
Will you help me?
Come on, come on.
Forget it, forget it!
Here. Throw this in there.
- Put that in!
- Ok.
Willie!
Will you get back here?
- How much yours come to?
- Shh!
I got $11,518.
What did yours come to?
9,821 big ones!
9,821 big ones.
Willie?
14,216.
- Geronimo!
- 14,216.
That's 5... 5...
$35,555.
Should have hit the safe, too.
We were right there.
First thing we got to do is change
our clothes and get rid of all this cash.
We can't keep it around here.
If they find out who we are,
they'll tear this place to pieces.
Listen. I got an old suitcase
I keep at Pete and Kathy's.
I think there's gonna be room
enough in there for all of this.
- Has it got a lock on it?
- It's got a lock on it.
You know Pete and Kathy,
they never go through my stuff anyways.
What do you think, Willie?
You... you all right?
Yeah.
If you fellas think it'll be safe there,
it's all right with me.
All right? All right.
I ought to get going.
You're sure you're all right?
Yeah. I think the excitement
must have upset my stomach a little.
Should we get you some
Alka-Seltzer or something?
Naw. Fresh air will take care of it.
Not long after they opened
their doors this morning...
...the Union Marine Bank on 36th
and Broadway in Manhattan...
Listen.
...was robbed by three
masked gunmen.
Made off with over
$50,000 in cash.
However, the thing that
makes this bank robbery...
...a little different
from the usual bank robbery...
...is that these bank robbers
were a little different.
Eyewitnesses at the scene...
All done.
Pete didn't ev...
It was obvious that all three
gunmen were well into their 70s.
The gray panthers, a lobbyist organization
for senior citizens' rights...
...do point out that the incident
dramatizes what the panthers call:
"The woeful inadequacy of the
current government programs...
...that attempt to deal with the elderly."
There is confusion today over the
newest labor department figures...
- We're famous.
- Did everything go all right?
- Perfect.
- Good.
Pete didn't miss the guns or nothing.
The money is locked
in one of my suitcases...
...stashed way in the back
in one of his closets.
Well, that's that.
Yeah. Could you let me talk
to Mr. Bender, please?
Joe Harris.
Bender? Joe Harris.
Yeah.
Ok. Listen, uh...
I'm down here at the Queensborough
Hospital with Al, and, uh, uh...
Willie...
Willie just died.
Yeah.
No. Just like that.
The doctor says his heart just gave out.
Anyways, could you send
somebody down here to pick him up?
Me and Al will come
over there in a little while...
...and settle on all the
arrangements with you.
Yeah. Let's do it up
nice this time, ok?
The hell with the social security.
We're going to be taking care of it.
Yeah. Cash, Bender, don't worry.
Yeah. Right. Right.
See you in a little while.
Pete?
Al, are you ok?
Yeah.
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.
We heard about Willie.
Jesus.
- We feel terrible.
- Yeah.
We got so worried.
We kept calling, but nobody answered.
Listen, we want you to come over
to the house for a couple of days.
Let us take care of you till this whole
thing's over. What do you say?
It would be great, Al.
You can relax and fool around with the kids.
Help you take your mind off of things.
- You think so, Joe?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah, come on. Stop being a baby.
Go ahead.
Ok. I'll go up and get some clothes.
You've still got the clothes you left
over when you sat for the kids.
Yeah. Come on, Al.
You going to be
all right, Joe?
Go ahead, go ahead.
Don't bother. I'll be fine.
Joe...
We've got plenty of room, and the kids
love playing with you, too. You know that.
Thanks, Pete, but I'd kind of like
to be alone tonight anyways.
Go ahead. Take care of
your uncle. I'll be all right.
Ok.
Well, we'll see you later on then, huh?
- Ok.
- Yeah.
If you change your mind,
or you need anything, just give us a call.
- You got our number?
- Yeah, I got it upstairs.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.
Crying and pissing in your pants
like a 3-month-old baby.
Well, I guess the whole god
damn cycle is complete now.
What a day this
is going to be.
Oh...
- How's my little bunny rabbit?
- Good.
- Your mommy and daddy here?
- Yeah.
- You going to say hello to my friend?
- Yeah.
- You remember his name?
- Yeah.
- What's his name?
- Joe.
That's right, sugar plum.
Say hello to Joe.
Hi... hello, Joe.
Hello, sweetheart.
You feeling a little
better this morning, Al?
Oh, yeah.
- How are you doing, Joe?
- Pretty good.
- Remember, uh, our offer's still open.
- Thanks a lot, but I'm all right.
- You're sure, now?
- Yeah. Thanks.
Excuse me. I've got to go see
what's doing down there.
Ok.
We'll see Joe later, all right?
Looking sharp, Kevin.
Feels funny to say, but I get the feeling I'm
going to be joining you real soon, Willie.
- What grade did you say Kevin was in?
- Third now.
- I'm going to fourth.
- That figures. It follows after third.
- Before you know it, three, four years...
- Two lights together.
- Look. Look.
- Yeah?
Two lights together.
Oh, that's right.
Don't worry 'bout that.
This is my summer vacation
in between third and fourth.
You get what vacation?
This is my summer vacation
in between third and fourth.
Al?
Can I talk to you
for a minute?
Here, I'll take her. Come on, sweetheart.
Come right here. Boom. Boom.
- What's up?
- Come here.
What do you say we give 25,000 to Pete?
What do you mean?
I mean why don't we give him $25,000?
That will leave us 10,000.
What the hell were we going to do
with all that money anyways?
Oh.
That would be great.
- That would be all right with you?
- It was my idea, wasn't it?
Pete?
- Can we talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.
Why don't we go next door
so we can have a little privacy.
- Ok. Is everything all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine.
Ok. Here, sweetheart.
- You want a beer?
- Ok.
Boone?
Can we have two beers, please?
You know, uh...
I'm beginning to feel a little better.
I think I'll go back to my own place
and stay there tonight.
Ok.
- Is that what you called me in here for?
- No, of course not.
- Now, Pete, you can't tell this to anybody.
- Sure. What is it?
Willie left us a $25,000
life insurance policy.
Now, Joe and I talked it over, and...
...we want to give you the $25,000 to use as
a down payment on your own gas station.
What?
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
Uh, I don't understand.
Look, we don't have too
much use for $25,000.
But me and Al could sure
use an extra $20 a week.
So we figure we give you the 25 grand...
...and in exchange, you give us
$20 a week until we die.
What do you say?
I don't know what to say.
Just say ok.
- Ok.
- All right, then. It's settled.
- Boy, am I glad that's all over with.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
Poor Willie never even got
to spend any of the dough.
Joe, what are you going to do
with all that money anyways?
I don't know.
You want to go to the movies?
I didn't mean right now.
I mean...
- You know.
- No. I don't know.
What?
20 years from now?
- So?
- I don't know.
Maybe you want to go out to the track
and bet on a couple races.
Too tired.
Maybe you ought to take some vitamins.
Now that we've got some money,
we can afford to get some vitamins for you.
- They don't do anything for you.
- No, I hear they do.
They say they give you energy.
- Yeah?
- That's what they say. I don't know.
You know, for the first time in 15 years
I feel like I need a vacation.
Why don't we take
some of that money...
...and go to Hawaii or Miami,
someplace nice like that?
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Why the hell not?
Let's go out to Las Vegas.
I always had to be a $2.00 bettor.
Now I could do some real gambling
and you can get some rest.
Sounds good to me.
- How do we get there?
- I don't know. Plane, I guess.
I've never been on a plane before.
Neither have I. So what?
We're only young once.
How much money
did you get?
Took along around 5,000.
Think that ought to be enough?
I think we'll be able to squeak by on that.
Got everything in there?
Everything. Got us clothes,
underwear... everything.
Toothbrushes, everything we need.
And I picked these up for you.
- What's this?
- Vitamins.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- To the airport.
- Which one?
The big one.
- Kennedy?
- That's it.
Well, that's it. We're on our way.
That's it? You mean you just
buy the tickets and that's it?
That's it.
It's amazing.
- Don't need no reservations or nothing?
- Guess not.
- What time do we have to be on the plane?
- About three minutes, Al.
Three minutes?
Three minutes.
- What's that rumbling sound?
- You asking me?
Joe... the wings are shaking.
Just close your eyes
and don't worry about it.
Oh, my god. Oh, god!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god in heaven!
Gentlemen.
Right this way,
sir.
Bet's on the 8.
- Bet's on the 8.
- Point is 6 here.
9, 9 upfield.
9, 9 upfield, 9.
Point is 6 now. 6 to win.
Your roll now.
10! 10 the hard way.
Two 5s the hard way, 10.
Here they go. Make your bets.
6 will win the money.
Do you unders...
Do you understand any of this?
It looks the same like we used to play
during the first world war...
...except here it looks
a little more comfortable.
Point is 6 now.
6 for a win.
9, 9, 9,
upfield 9.
- Could we get $2,500 worth of chips, please?
- Change coming in.
Point is 6.
6 will win.
10! 10 a pair.
10 easy.
Make sure that's right, will you?
- You know what you're doing?
- I think so.
$35 right here on the left.
- Give him $2,500.
- Ok, thanks.
- Right.
- Point is 6, shooter.
6 to win.
Here they roll.
7 out! 9 away. No 6.
7 comes in. Nos get paid.
- You lose, then?
- He lost, yeah.
All right, here we go.
A new shooter coming out.
- You'll be the shooter, sir.
- I'll pass the dice.
All right, next shooter's next.
- What does that mean, I go?
- Just pick up two and throw them.
All right, here they go.
Bet them now.
- Now's the time to make a bet.
- Pick up two of the dice?
- Yeah, just pick up two of the dice.
- You need to make a bet, sir.
100 on the line.
Throw them nice now.
- Just two?
- Pick up two. Two.
- All right, here they go. Let it roll.
- All right. Throw them.
They roll, they go...
5, 5!
- Do you give odds on the 5?
- 3-to-2, sir.
I'd like to put another 200 on the 5.
Where do I do that?
Ok. There you are.
Sir, you must hit the end rail
every time you throw the dice.
- Must hit the end.
- Oh, ok. I'm sorry.
- Throw 'em out there.
- That's quite all right, sir.
They got to go all the way down,
hit that, and come back?
Right.
- Same two dice?
- Same two dice.
Shoot them right up, sir.
Point is 5.
5 a win...
8, 8.
It's the 8.
- What does 8 mean?
- Nothing. 5 is what we want.
A 3 and a 2.
A 4 and a 1.
Set them up. Crap 11, 7.
Now's the time. Get them down and roll.
- Go, 5.
- 3 and a 2, 4 and a 1, want a 5.
- 5!
- 5 a winner! Pay the man.
Atta boy, Al.
$25 limit.
Who else? Crap 11 now.
- Ok.
- One bet, high 11.
$300 on the line, says my
friend Al throws them right.
- Throw it, Al.
- Here they go. They roll.
- I'm betting 300, Al.
- Shooter coming out.
- Do it.
- They roll. They go...
7 winner!
Winner 7. Winner 7.
We just won 300.
We're ahead about $600.
Another 300.
- Coming out again! Let it roll!
- Another 300.
7, winner!
We're winning a fortune!
Look at this, a $500 chip.
- Ok, another 500 on the line.
- Another 500 on the line.
- Here they go. They roll.
- Hot dice.
- Do it! Yo, 11!
- 11!
Coming out again!
Bet them up!
Pretty good, Al. 11.
- $1,000 on the line.
- This table has a $500 limit.
You must be kidding.
What is this, a kid's game?
You can make another bet in the field...
...come bet or place bet,
but $500 is all you can bet per number.
Ok, pal...
- 500 on the 4.
- $500 each?
5 on the 5...
5 on the 6...
5 on the 8...
5 on the 9...
...and 5 on the 10.
Now we've got
everything covered.
- What do I do now?
- Just throw the dice.
- Just throw the dice and shut up.
- Stay away from that 7. no 7, now.
5, 5. no field.
- Al, you're a genius.
- I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
Don't worry about it. Just throw
those numbers and let me handle this.
The point is 5, shooter.
3 to make a 5 to win.
- I've got to shoot for 5?
- Shoot just numbers. 5, 4...
- I'm just asking. A 5 or what?
- 6, 8, anything but a 7.
- No 7s!
- No 7!
- 5 a winner!
- 5! We've got another 5.
Atta boy, Al.
- $1,000 right there. Look at that.
- Beautiful.
Ok! Come on, keep throwing
those numbers. Where's the dice?
- Let's have the bones.
- The bones. Give the man the bones!
He's got the bones.
Throw the bones out!
- Wow!
- Good.
9, 9, 9.
There we are.
We get some more money.
You throw the dice,
and I keep collecting money, Al.
Put her right there.
Right there. I don't want to reach.
I don't want to hurt myself.
How about that?
- This is amazing.
- A... number!
8.
- This is crazy.
- How much are we ahead?
- I can't lift it.
- Well, give me half of it.
No, no, no.
You throw the dice.
They roll.
They're in the air.
- 4 the hard way!
- The hard way 4.
Get some real money.
Here we are. We better put them in here.
3 red chips, any time. Another 1,000.
Want to give me another
1,000 for 3 red chips?
Trying to be funny.
Boy, I bet Willie would've
enjoyed all of this.
Yeah. Hey, Willie,
I hope you're watching this.
What am I talking about?
Probably setting it all up for us.
Go ahead. Throw them.
- Again?
- Yes, again.
Here they go.
They roll.
Do it!
- 10! Hard 10!
- Hard 10.
Ok, Al, you collect the money.
I'm tired.
I'll have a cream cheese and jelly sandwich
on rye bread and a cup of coffee, please.
Cream cheese and jelly?
What would you like?
Let me see.
- I'll have the same thing.
- Thank you.
After we eat, you want to go to one
of them girlie shows they've got?
I don't know.
- I'm getting kind of tired.
- Yeah, me, too.
I guess we're a little too old
for this kind of nonsense.
Hello.
Oh, excuse me.
Why, I never dreamt
that a place like this existed.
You want a 6 now.
Shoot a 6.
You got a 6 to make.
Make a hard 6. Shoot a 6.
- What?
- Shooting for 6.
6 is my point.
4 and 2, 3 and 3, and a 5, 1 make 6.
- 6 now. Throw 6.
- Wait a minute. Hold it.
Hold it, he says.
Throw a 6, Al.
Do anything you want, but throw a 6.
Hey, hey, 6. 4 and 2, 3 and 3,
5 and 1. 6, baby! Piece of cake!
- 6 now.
- Winner, 6 hard!
Hard way winner!
I ain't... I ain't never,
ever seen anything like this.
That's good sentence structure.
45 here and 900 more here for the hard 6.
- Pretty good, huh? How much we got there?
- I don't know.
I stopped counting around 20 minutes ago.
Back then I had more than 30 grand.
- 30 or 13?
- 30, Al, and that was 20 minutes ago.
That don't include
the 11 grand from before.
- Jesus Christ.
- I know.
You're coming out. Same shooter.
You're going to shoot them again, aren't you?
Hold it, hold it,
hold it.
Uh...
Let's just go for one more roll then cash
in our chips and see what's going on, ok?
Ok, anything you say.
Would you take all the bets
off the numbers please?
- All your bets?
- Right.
Well, leave 500 on the 8
and 500 on the 6.
Off on the hard 6, too.
Hard 6 off. Right.
Ok, Al, now you
can throw them.
- Ready, folks?
- Ready.
7, 11, 5 and a 2,
6 and 1, and 6 and 5 are 11.
Crap dice, crap dice, take the line.
Pay the "don't" side.
Here you go, gentlemen,
buy yourselves some hats.
Thank you, sir.
Can I have a rack, please?
A rack for these chips.
- How much have we got?
- I'll tell you later.
- How much are we ahead?
- Later, later.
- Ladle?
- Later! I'll tell you later.
Ok. This totals $61,900.
- That's all?
- That's all.
~ da da da dee
dum da dum ~
We got to get out of here right away.
What did that come to
with what we won before?
A little over 73 grand.
This is serious stuff.
Some of them bums downstairs
are gonna try and rob us...
...or the FBI will wonder
who the old guys are.
I read in the paper once where they hang
out in joints like this looking for crooks.
So what do we do?
We got to get the money
and get the hell out of here.
May I help you?
Yes. Um, you see, me and my friend here won
a whole bunch of money at your crap tables.
We're looking for a little bag about so big.
Like one of those overnight bags...
...or something like that,
to take the money back home with us.
Something with a lock
on it if you've got it.
In leather, I presume.
Leather sounds nice.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Remember us?
- Well, sure.
We came to pick up our money.
Here's our receipts.
If you gentlemen will wait a moment,
I'll have a check drawn for you.
Uh, we'd prefer it in cash if you can.
Well, normally when it is this amount,
we do like to have a company check drawn.
It's basically like a cashier's check.
Yeah, well, we'd kind of
like the cash instead.
Stuff some clothes in here.
- Here you are, kid.
- Thank you, sir.
Maybe we should have spent the night.
I'm exhausted.
It didn't feel right to me back there.
Believe me, this is the best way.
You'll get some sleep on the plane.
You kidding?
I could sooner fall asleep
on a roller coaster.
I don't like
them jets.
I don't trust no plane
that ain't got propellers.
Ah.
Oh.
You were great back there, Al.
Bet you them guys never saw
nobody roll like that before.
You weren't doing too
bad either, you know.
The way you kept moving
them chips around... boy.
Yeah.
Feels like we've lived two lives.
One before the robbery, and one after.
The city budget continues to be
the main point of contention...
...between the mayor
and the city council president.
The mayor says
the council's decision...
...to spend an additional $8 million
for the budget was irresponsible.
There's been some movement
in the investigation...
...of that bank robbery at Broadway
and 36th street last Thursday.
Although the FBI
isn't saying much...
...a source at the police
department tells W.I.N.S...
...he wouldn't be surprised if
there was a break in the case...
...of the three elderly men who
held up the union marine bank.
He characterized the robbery...
...as a job done by
"a careless group of amateurs."
What the hell are
you talking about?
A careless group
of amateurs...
Wake up, Al.
The cops just called us a bunch of amateurs.
I suppose you got to knock off
a bank every other week...
...in order to get some
respect from those jerks.
Al, wake up.
Al.
Hey, Al, wake up.
Hey, Al.
Al?
Joe. Hey, how you doing?
Come on in.
Thanks.
- Where's Al?
- He's at home.
I just came over to talk
to you about some stuff.
Oh, sure.
- Nothing wrong, is there?
- No. No.
- Hello, Joe.
- Hiya, beautiful.
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.
Joe, you look kind of tired.
Would you like a cup of coffee or something?
No, thanks.
Well... if you already got some made.
We got any coffee made, Kath?
No. It'll only take a second,
though, if you want some.
- Yeah, thanks.
- Sure.
- Is there somewhere we can go to talk alone?
- Sure. Yeah. Come on.
Come on. You three guys did that?
Are you bullshitting me?
That's only the half of it.
Right after we buried Willie...
...me and your uncle took off
to Las Vegas for a couple hours...
...and cleaned those bums
out for over 70,000.
- 17 or 70?
- 70. 7-0.
Between the bank job and Vegas,
it comes to a little over $107,000.
Jesus Christ.
Pete...
Al's dead.
What?
Al died a couple of hours ago.
We came back from Las Vegas this afternoon.
We were real tired... Al especially.
We didn't get any sleep
since before the funeral.
What, with all the excitement and everything,
it must have been too much for him.
Jesus.
As soon as we got home,
we both fell asleep right away.
I woke up and...
he must have died in his sleep.
Pete?
Coffee's ready.
- All right, honey. We'll be up in a minute.
- Want me to bring it down?
- It's all right. We'll be up soon.
- All right.
Where is he?
I called Ryan's Funeral Parlor before
I came over. Everything is taken care of.
Pete...
I know this whole thing
is going to be rough on you...
...but you got to pull together
and listen to me for a minute.
I need your help.
Ok. Go ahead.
When me, Al, and Willie did the bank job,
we didn't know what the hell we were doing.
The whole thing was stupid.
We just ran in and did it.
Now I've been hearing
stuff on the radio...
...I'm thinking about how
we went about this thing.
I got a feeling that we
loused up or something.
Fingerprints or some... I don't know what,
but I got a feeling that we screwed up.
What I need from you, Pete,
is somewhere to stash all this money...
...cause there may be some trouble.
Well, I'm with you, Joe.
Whatever I can do.
You got one of them
safety deposit boxes?
Yeah.
You think all this will fit in it?
- Well, I guess I could squeeze it in.
- You're a good kid, Pete.
I want you to take care of this right away...
the first thing in the morning.
But you got to promise me
if anything should happen...
...you won't turn any of this dough
over to the cops or anything.
Just bring you trouble.
Them bastards would probably wind up
taking all of it, thinking it was all stolen.
All right, then.
I'm going to get going.
Just remember... no matter what happens,
do exactly like I told you, Pete.
Don't worry about me, Joe.
- I'll do just like you say.
- Ok.
I'll see you at Ryan's
in the morning then.
Ok.
13-23.
13-23. 484, report.
That's it, boys.
They got us.
Well, looks like I'm going
to be living a third life.
Did you plan the robbery, Mr. Harris?
Can you tell us where the money is?
What were you going to do
with all the money?
Hello, Mr. Harris.
I'm Bob Jensen.
I've been asked to come down here
and speak with you, because...
...well, somebody...
...in Washington thought they heard
you might be a little reluctant...
...to cooperate with our men down here.
Excuse me for one second.
Maybe I could save you
some of your valuable time.
Ok.
Like I told your buddies here,
me and my two friends robbed the bank.
We did it, and we buried the money,
and I ain't ever gonna tell you where...
...and you sure as hell ain't ever
going to find it on your own.
So why don't you just lock me up
and forget all about this whole thing?
You'll be doing everybody a favor.
They tell me... Joe...
...that you don't have any record at all.
In fact, there's every indication you've
been a law-abiding, productive member...
...of your community since,
well, let's face it...
...since a long time before
I learned how to walk.
This, along with the fact
that this whole incident...
...has become a widely
publicized social issue...
...has helped for a lot of forces, including
ourselves, to rally to your support.
But you'll have to meet us
halfway on this.
Now, I can't promise you...
...but if you can show us you've changed your
attitude, I think there's every indication...
...that you'll walk away from this
whole mess, and I mean scot-free.
You got an extra
piece of gum?
So...
...what do you say, Joe?
Hm?
I say, why don't you
get the hell out of here?
You give me a headache.
Thanks for the gum.
- Inmate's name?
- Joe Harris.
- Your name?
- Pete McCaffrey.
- Pete or Peter?
- Well, l... I guess Peter.
- Can I see some identification, please?
- Sure.
Thanks.
- Hiya, Pete.
- Hi, Joe.
They're going to make me go
to lunch in about a minute...
...so I'll have to
make this kind of short.
Kathy sends her love.
She wanted to come down and see you, too,
but we couldn't get nobody to watch the kids.
You didn't tell her about any of
the stuff we talked about, did you?
- No. Of course not.
- Good.
I felt bad I couldn't go to Al's funeral.
- Did it all go ok?
- Yeah.
- How do you like that lawyer they gave you?
- Yeah... he's a nice kid.
- Yeah, I spoke with him.
- What do you mean?
Well, I didn't tell him nothing, but we
just talked about the case a little bit.
He says they're gonna be a lot
tougher on you than you thought...
...if you don't give 'em back the money.
Yeah? Well, screw them.
I don't know, Joe. Maybe if you just
give them back the money from the robbery.
Forget it. Al and Willie would
both die if I gave that money back.
Besides, Pete...
let me tell you something.
For the past couple of years,
me, Al, and Willie...
...all sat on that park bench
and looked at each other.
Maybe a politician would come around
and talk to us at election time...
...but that was about it.
That was our life.
Here, I've got my own cell
with a toilet and a sink.
The food's ok, and I'm feeling good.
As a matter of fact, they treat me
like a king around here.
Everyone comes around to talk,
and they all want to do me favors.
Pretty soon, they'll all wind up
asking me where I hid the money.
They don't know it,
but they're all older than me.
All right. We're going
to have to wrap it up now.
Inside or out, I'm a prisoner either way,
so don't worry about me, Pete.
You just enjoy all your inheritance
and take care of Kathy and the kids.
Al would have really liked that.
Ok. Let's get going.
And besides...
...no tinhorn joint like this
could ever hold me.
