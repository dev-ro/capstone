This one's coming down to the
wire, folks.
The Cougars trail by 4
with 35 seconds left.
Knights with the basketball.
Pressure! Pressure! Pressure!
Stay on him, Ty!
Pick him up, Ethan!
Come here! Come here! Come here!
Knights call their
final time-out.
Okay, listen. They're gonna try to
hold the ball and run out the clock.
You got to keep the pressure up.
Get in their face!
When we get the ball
back, run a double flex,
look for Ethan or Jeff for a
three, then crash the boards.
Stay at full court
press till it's over.
Cougars on three.
One, two, three!
Cougars!
Let's go. Come on!
Knights to inbound,
25 seconds remaining.
Ty, get him! Get him, Ty!
Yeah!
Jeff! Jeff!
- Three-pointer!
- Yeah!
Press! Press!
Pick him up, Ty!
Ethan! Ethan!
Shoot it! Shoot it! Shoot it!
Good game.
- Good game.
- Good game.
- Good game, coach.
- Final score, Knights 86,
Brookshire Cougars, 83.
We wanna thank you all for your support
this season. Please, drive home safely.
Dad.
Hey, I know. I know. Come on.
All right, everybody,
look at me.
I wanted this one too.
I am proud of you.
And here's the good news.
That team's the biggest
hurdle we'll face next year.
They're graduating four of their starters
while all of you are coming back.
We'll also be that
much stronger.
Which means next season,
we take everything.
See, right there.
That is eight calls they missed.
And he just walked!
You gonna show the
refs your video?
Oh, I'm thinking about it.
I think it would
do a lot of good.
- Nah...
- Mm-hm.
Hey, John? Amy?
You might want to come see this.
You go. I got to finish
this up for fifth period.
- All right. I'll be back.
- Okay. All right.
We have just confirmed
that Tarsa Steel,
the town's oldest manufacturing
plant, is closing its doors,
moving its local operations to
facilities elsewhere in the state.
We've been told that local
employees will have the option
of transferring to
another location.
News 3's Ashley Graham
joins us live from downtown
with more on this
developing story.
Phil, I'm outside of the plant
where a company representative
tells me the transition will
be finished by July 1st.
In a city of 24,000,
estimates are that this will
directly impact 6000
jobs in Franklin.
There goes the football program.
You don't know that.
Most of my players have
parents that work at the plant.
The board has voted to
close our plant in Franklin.
This ain't gonna be pretty.
We're moving our production to our
plants in Sharpsville and Fairview,
but we are gonna
give our employees
the opportunity to transfer
to one of those locations.
Local businesses are
also learning of the news
and bracing for what lies ahead.
- I got you one.
- Watch down low, watch down low!
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Yeah!
Hey, I got it, I got it.
- Back out, back out.
- You got to play D.
I got him, I got him.
Come on. Yeah.
Yo, man, this is it right here.
That's all you! ALL: Yeah!
- Best out of five.
- Where you at?
- Best out of five!
- Nah. Not no "best out of five."
Ha. You funny, man!
You're always complaining.
All y'all always complaining.
Hey, where are my headphones?
Hey, y'all see my headphones?
I had them right here.
No, you don't!
Hey, come on!
Bring it back or you're dead!
- Do you see her?
- No.
Listen.
- I bet she ran into those apartments.
- Who was she?
I don't know.
Baby, where have you been?
I thought the camp
dismissed at 4:00.
I walked by Webb Park.
Webb Park? Why?
Where'd this come from?
I found it in your jean pocket.
I found it.
Hannah Scott, do not lie to me.
I already bought
you one of these.
Brookshire's giving
you a chance.
You're not gonna get
thrown out of there too.
Take it back.
I'm already late for work.
Your food is on the stove.
I'll be back at 10.
I mean it, Hannah. Take it back.
Yes, Grandma.
Hey, be careful. They're hot.
- Will. Did you wash your hands?
- Yes, ma'am.
Dad, did you hear Coach
Wright is moving to Fairview?
He went from 32 players to 13,
so I think he saw the writing on the wall.
So no football on Friday nights?
Wash your hands
before you sit down.
Most of those boys will play
soccer or baseball in the spring,
so they'll be fine.
Well, they could run cross-country.
Gary would love that.
Whatever.
- Hey, what about our team?
- We're in good shape.
We still got your brother, Ty and the
twins, so we still got our best players.
- So how was work?
- It was fine.
We had two groups come
in, but neither escaped.
Because the rooms are too hard.
Do you know how many
students we'll have?
- I think about 240. We had 550 last year.
- Oh.
Don't say that.
That makes me so sad.
Well, I think we'll be fine
as long as no one else leaves.
Gary is leaving.
Why is Gary leaving?
He took a job in Texas.
So now I'm down three
coaches and two teachers,
and school starts next week.
At this point,
I don't think I could save football,
but I do think I have a
solution for cross-country.
Who?
- No.
- I believe you could do it.
Olivia, I'm not a cross-country coach.
I don't even like running.
Amy bought me a treadmill three years ago.
I never use it.
I don't want to have to
cancel another program.
You are my best option.
Cross-country's not
even a real sport.
That's not fair. Come on, now.
I have never seen your basketball
players throwing up after a game.
Exactly. I don't want to see that.
No one wants to see that.
And it overlaps with basketball.
Not by much.
John, I have heard you give
inspirational speeches to your players
about stepping up under pressure
and going the extra mile.
That is exactly what I need
from our staff right now.
Hey, guys.
Y'all here for tryouts?
- Tryouts?
- Cross-country.
No, sir. We're just hanging out.
- None of you are here to try out?
- No, sir. Sorry.
- Hey, you here for cross-country?
- Yes, sir.
Do you know anybody
else coming to try out?
No, sir.
- Okay. Tell me your name.
- Hannah Scott.
Hey, Hannah. I'm Coach Harrison.
There's a form.
Okay, you're a sophomore. Uh...
Oh, you ran at Franklin
High last year.
Yes, sir.
Born on Valentine's Day.
I'm sorry, Hannah. Is that...?
It's for my asthma.
- You have asthma?
- Yes, sir.
Okay.
Olivia.
- There is no cross-country program.
- What do you mean?
I had one girl show up,
and she's got asthma.
- Oh, you mean Hannah Scott.
- Yes.
Does she want to run?
Yes, but we can't allow that.
How could she compete?
Her grandmother already
gave me a doctor's note.
She ran at Franklin last year.
She just has to keep her inhaler with her.
We still don't have a team,
so what does it matter?
I thought that one runner could
still medal without a team.
Uh... Technically,
but why have a season with one runner?
Because one runner matters.
John, you are a good coach,
and you're a good teacher.
If she wants to try
out, then let her.
Okay.
Come on. What you got?
Where your handles at?
You trying to dig
into me like that?
Don't let him push you around.
Take it to the hole.
Okay, that's you. That's you.
Hey! There it is. WILL: Oh!
I may have two boys
playing in college.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Ethan's a good big brother.
He is a good big brother.
So how was tryouts?
Well,
I gathered everyone together,
and I said to her,
"Thanks for coming out."
- No.
- Yeah.
- One person?
- Hannah Scott. She's a sophomore.
- She's got asthma.
- Hannah Scott?
Yeah. I have her in science.
I caught Olivia afterwards,
still wants me to coach her.
Hey, I think that Neil
Hatcher just pulled up.
Hmm.
What was that about?
Twins are moving to Sharpsville.
What's happening to my team?
This is supposed to be our year.
Okay, Hannah.
Looks like to medal in this division,
you'll need a time under 22 minutes.
To medal in state, it's under 21
minutes, and for what it's worth,
the current state
champion, Gina Mimms,
runs a 5K pretty
consistently in less than 20.
She's a senior.
- Have you been timed lately?
- No, sir.
Okay. Maybe we start there.
- You've already walked the course?
- Yes, sir.
I'm gonna go get the golf
cart while you stretch.
- Do you have your inhaler?
- I'll just run with it.
- Can I run too?
- It's three miles, buddy.
- You need to finish your homework.
- Please? I promise I'll get it done.
At least she wouldn't
be running alone.
All right. Okay.
I'll time you guys. Come on.
Hannah, I bet you can
run this in 24 minutes.
- Twenty-four? I can do it in 24.
- Heh.
- I doubt that.
- Oh, please.
All right, Hannah!
Come on, bring it in!
Come on. You're almost done.
Great job. All right. Nice job.
Twenty-three fifteen. Not bad.
Make sure you walk around a little
bit before you sit down, okay?
Look at you, Will!
You've got this!
Great job, great job.
Twenty-four ten.
That was amazing, Will.
That was terrible.
Why would anybody want to do this?
Let me get you both some
water, okay?
The problem with this sport
is that there's no ball.
There's no dunking
or goals or anything.
I think this sport's about
endurance, sweetie.
Finally.
I was about ready to take
the golf cart out there.
He looks like he's dying.
Don't die. Don't die.
- Wow, Dad. You did it.
- Ha-ha-ha. All right.
See, if he was carrying a ball,
this would be like a touchdown.
- Are you okay?
- Ugh.
That was terrible.
Why would anyone want to do this?
That's what I said.
I think you're supposed to
walk around a little bit.
No! Leave me alone!
Oh, I feel like death.
- Need me to call you an ambulance?
- What was my time?
Thirty-two oh-two.
- What? I didn't even break 307
- Mm-mm.
- I'm just impressed that you finished.
- Ah! Go away!
Hey, Hannah?
Do you have a ride home?
It's just a mile. I can walk.
No, no. We can take you home.
We'd love to meet your parents.
It's just me and my grandma.
My parents have passed.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
We'd be happy to take you home.
I can call your grandmother
and let her know.
I'm okay. I don't mind walking.
Thanks anyway.
Okay.
Hey, didn't I take my watch off out here?
Or did I leave it at home?
John,
she did better than I expected.
Yeah.
Did you know her
parents passed away?
Ethan could do it if he wanted
to, you know.
He sure could.
You know, John, I just...
I don't understand.
I don't understand why he won't run.
He's your son and
he's so athletic.
He would do really
well out there.
You know, and then...
Then we could all be out there together.
You know,
I could go talk to him.
Okay. Yeah, that's good.
- I could go now.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey.
Can I appeal to you to
think about something?
What's that?
I know you don't want
to do cross-country,
but there are advantages to it.
- Dad...
- Just hear me out.
I'm not gonna twist your arm.
Running will help
you stay in shape.
You make the team
run as punishment.
That's true,
but it'll help you stay disciplined.
And it'll show a lot
of school spirit.
And I think you'd be
really good at it.
You know how you've always
practiced basketball with me?
Yeah.
Well,
even though I would hate it...
if you'll run with
me to train...
I'll do it.
He's not running.
Oh, John. Why not?
You know, Amy, it's okay.
He doesn't want to,
and we just need to be supportive.
Okay. I'll talk to him.
Oh, no, no, no.
You know what? Let's...
We just need to give him
space, you know?
And love him, and we don't
have to bring it up anymore.
Really?
Okay.
It's Mark.
Hey, pastor.
Oh. Oh, oh, oh. Hey.
I forgot to tell you that I
told him you would do visitation
at the hospital tonight.
Yes. Yes.
I will be there in an hour.
- Thanks for volunteering.
- Hospital lobby.
- I'll see you in a bit. Bye-bye.
- See you there.
You know what?
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
- Need to grab a shower.
- Okay.
You're a good man,
John Harrison.
- Whatever.
- Mm-hm.
Ben is one of our
founding members.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Here we go.
Excuse me.
May we see Mr. Hutchins?
There's several family
members in there already.
Maybe just one at a time
while the room's full?
Oh, no, that's fine. You go on.
Give me a few minutes,
then you can go in.
- Yeah, I'll be right out here.
- Okay.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Oh.
- Sorry, sir. I didn't mean to disturb you.
- Who's there?
Um, I'm just waiting to visit
a church member next door.
Are you a minister?
No, sir. Uh, I'm just here visiting
a few people with my pastor.
Well, if you're just waiting,
maybe you can visit me too.
Sure. Um...
My name's John. John Harrison.
Thomas Hill.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Thomas.
- Um... Have you been here very long?
- About three weeks.
Been trying to keep diabetes
from getting too greedy.
Took my sight a few years ago.
Now it wants my legs and my kidneys.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Uh, do you have family here?
I'm more or less on my own.
I grew up in Franklin, though.
They brought me back here
from, uh, Fairview.
Get dialysis here.
Heh. You might be the only
one coming from Fairview.
I think everybody else
is heading that way.
Heh. That's what I hear.
So tell me about yourself, John.
Well, um, so I'm the basketball
coach at Brookshire Christian.
I hope, anyway.
You don't sound too sure.
Well, there's a lot of things
I'm not too sure about right now.
Um, I also teach history, and I've been
assigned the cross-country program.
Aha. Cross-country.
That was my sport.
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
I was third in the
state in my day.
Really?
Uh, then I might need some advice,
because I don't know what I'm doing.
So how do you train to have that
big kick at the end of the race?
Oh, that kick...
John, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Visiting hours are almost over.
Oh, are they? Sure. Um...
Thomas, I should probably
say hello next door.
No problem. Hey, John?
I don't get many visitors
that I can talk shop with.
Feel free to come back anytime.
It's good to meet you, Thomas.
I'll be praying for you.
I'll take it.
You guys get to class.
You get...
Ladies. Let's go.
You're not teaching next
hour, right?
- Right.
- Great.
I need you to judge
drama monologues.
Drama monologues?
I got history papers to grade.
Yeah. History's already happened,
and I really need three judges.
Come to drama class.
History has already happened.
This is drama, people.
This moment is why we're
here, okay?
Hope you're ready.
Here we go.
Oh, no, no, no. I need to sit
in the middle. That's my seat.
Sure.
- Is there a third judge?
- Oh, yes. Um...
- Here she is.
- I am so sorry that I am late.
We had to put the potato salad
leftovers in the refrigerator.
- Hey, John.
- Bonnie.
Thank you for coming.
- What do I do?
- Just follow my lead.
Okay.
Wesley Ford.
You're first.
Oh, sing, oh,
heart of great desire...
where passion glows
like burning flame.
My bride doth set
my love afire...
the first night when
she calls my name.
That's pretty much it.
Ay. Okay. Uh...
Bonnie...
your thoughts?
- I thought it was real nice.
- Okay. John?
No, we don't like it, Wesley.
We just don't believe you.
C-minus.
Okay,
let's keep the ball rolling.
Mindy Smith.
Coach Harrison, got a minute?
Hey, Ken. How are you?
Fine, thank you.
Ty.
Hey, coach.
Um... We wanted to come tell you that
we decided to move Ty to Cornerstone.
He's got a good chance of
getting a scholarship there,
and after we've lost so
many players here, well...
I understand.
Look, you're an excellent coach,
and none of this is your fault.
We just have to do what's
best for his future.
You're a great player, Ty.
I'll watch you on TV one day.
Thanks, coach.
I enjoyed playing for you.
Thanks again.
- Yeah.
- Good luck.
Hey, buddy?
- Will. Homework, 10 minutes.
- Yes, ma'am.
Ethan, it's your turn to
clean the kitchen tonight.
Dad, did Ty come see you today?
Yep.
Of course.
What?
Brookshire School Board letter.
Ten-percent pay cut.
Does this surprise you?
Nope.
Hey, John?
Your plate's getting cold.
Why are you doing that now?
Is it bothering you?
Yes.
What's the urgency?
Those bricks have been
laying there for months.
And they've needed to be
cleaned up for months.
So you have to do it now?
Do you need me to
be doing something?
Yes.
Actually, I do.
I have papers to grade and
laundry to take care of,
and Will needs help
with his homework.
So can this wait,
or do you still need more time to pout?
- Excuse me?
- Okay, John.
You know what? I get it.
You're a basketball
coach without a team,
and now you have to
coach cross-country.
- But it's not the end of the world.
- Oh, is it that simple?
I'm glad it's so clear to you.
But you forgot the 10-percent pay cut,
no scholarship option for our son,
no possibility of winning
with one runner with asthma.
So while I'm left with a job
that's totally pointless,
- I'm glad I have your understanding.
- Stop it!
No one asked for this,
but this is what we've got.
Are you trying to help me?
Because you're not!
Mom?
Are you okay?
Buddy...
You and Ethan, you guys need to
come and clean up the kitchen, okay?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.
So...
I have this problem
that pops up sometimes.
And I see things about my
husband that I don't really like,
and so I just...
I want to try and fix 'em.
But I'm not very good at it.
And maybe, you know,
I'm not supposed to be...
because he gets
really angry with me.
But the thing is...
The thing is is that...
I really, really love him.
He's a very good husband.
And he's a great dad.
And I know I don't
tell him enough.
So when he's discouraged
and he's hurting, I just...
I want to try and
help, and it's...
It's not always
easy to know how.
You know?
So maybe... Maybe if I just...
If I tell him...
and remind him...
that I love him...
and that I'm praying for him...
and that I'm here for him.
I am right here for him.
Can I do that?
I love you.
I love you too.
I love you, John Harrison.
I'm sorry I've been a jerk.
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.
Hey. Come here.
They're okay.
Hey, Hannah. Can I sit with you?
Sure.
I hear you're running in your
first cross-country race tomorrow.
Are you excited?
A little.
We don't really have a team.
Girl, that makes me
admire you even more.
You still represent our school.
Do you enjoy running?
It's really the only
thing I'm good at.
Hey, good morning.
- Hey, Miss Scott.
- Good morning.
- Thanks for giving Hannah a ride.
- Of course.
- We should have her back by 3.
- Sounds good. Take care.
Hey, Hannah.

John Harrison.
Hey, Mitch. How are you?
- You coaching cross-country?
- I'm trying. Heh.
You're not gonna beat me in
another sport now, are you?
Uh...
So, uh, where's your team?
She's right there.
Well, basketball season's
just around the corner.
Yeah.
Runners, take your mark.
She's fast.
That's Gina Mimms.
She's last year's state champion.
All right! There she is!
Go, Hannah! Whoo!
Go, Hannah!
- Think she's 34th.
- Not bad for her first race, huh?
It's not that great either.
So, what's your plan, coach?
- Thomas?
- Yes?
Hey, it's John Harrison.
Oh. Heh.
It's the maybe-maybe
not basketball coach.
Yeah. It's looking
more like maybe not.
- You got time for a visit?
- Let me check my calendar.
Yeah.
I guess I could squeeze you in.
Interval training is good too.
Run one minute fast,
then one minute slow.
Then increase to two minutes
fast, one slow.
Three fast...
Well, you get the idea.
Oh, this is good.
Oh, it should go without
saying that them eating healthy
and getting good sleep
is crucial for your team.
I only have one runner,
and she's got asthma.
- So I have to figure...
- Ha-ha-ha.
Wait a minute. Hold up.
You lost your ball team,
you changed sports and
you still got no team?
Oh, that's sad even for me.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Well, you see why I'm so frustrated?
Yeah, actually, I do.
This year, I had the
players, I had the schedule.
I mean,
this was gonna be our year.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to dump on you.
John...
if I asked you...
who you are,
what's the first thing
that comes to mind?
I'm a basketball coach.
And if that's stripped away?
I'm also a history teacher.
Okay.
We take that away, who are you?
Well, I'm a husband,
I'm a father.
And God forbid that
should ever change.
But if it does,
who are you?
- I don't understand this game.
- It's not a game. Who are you?
Um... I'm a white American male.
Yeah, that's for sure.
Is there anything else?
Well, I'm a Christian.
And what's that mean?
It means "follower of Christ."
And how important is that?
It's very important.
Interesting...
how it's so far down your list.
Wait a minute.
- I could've easily said Christian first.
- Yeah, but you didn't.
Look, John.
Your identity will be tied to
whatever you give your heart to.
Doesn't sound like the
Lord has first place.
You're calling me
a bad Christian?
Let me be a little direct.
Last time you were here...
you said you'd pray for me.
Did you?
- No.
- No.
For someone who
knows the Lord...
you're acting like
somebody who doesn't.
Which makes me wonder.
What have you allowed
to define you?
When you lost your team...
it didn't just disappoint
you, it devastated you.
Something...
or someone...
will have first
place in your heart.
But when you find
your identity...
in the One who created you...
it'll change your
whole perspective.
You know, you could still
be a walk-on somewhere.
That won't pay for college.
So earn it.
Lots of guys get a scholarship
when they're already on a team.
Or make the grades.
What if I can't do it?
I'll help you where I can.
But you may have to get a job and work
your way through like most people.
If you never play
in college at all...
I'll love you and I'm
already proud of you.
But to keep you humble,
I'm about to tear you up in one-on-one.
Check.
- Come on, Dad. Don't do this to yourself.
- Give me the ball. You're going down.
Dad, you can't beat me.
Oh. You're gonna let me
do that in front of you?
- It is on. Okay!
- No! It's make it, take it. Give me the ball.
- Make it, take it. Here we go. Ready?
- Are you kidding?
- Come on, young man.
- Whatever.
- Foul. Foul. Foul.
- Foul? No. No foul.
- Foul!
- Come on. Are you kidding?
- So I have the answer.
- For what?
A plan to fix cross-country.
- I call it "The Plan to Fix Cross-Country."
- Nice title.
Imagine,
every runner is dribbling a ball.
- For three miles?
- Yeah.
And before they cross the finish
line, they have to dunk it
on an eight-foot goal
unless they get tackled.
- So there's tackling?
- Oh, yeah.
And if you take someone's
ball, it's double the points.
Gotcha.
So, what if I tackle
them under the goal,
take their ball
and double dunk on them?
Ha-ha. And what did you say?
I told him I liked it,
but I couldn't make any changes this year.
He calls it "Tackle
Ball Extreme."
Well, they do change the
rules from time to time.
Oh, there's a few schools trying to get
earbuds allowed for runners right now.
- During races?
- Yeah. It won't happen.
So I've started implementing
your running tips.
- She's running intervals now.
- Good.
You should see some improvement.
I also, uh,
want to thank you for what you said.
I think I'm more of a hypocrite
than I'd like to admit.
John...
that's true of me too.
Three years ago...
God had to let me lose
my sight so I could see.
When I was much younger...
I found myself in athletics.
Then my job, then friends...
Then it turned to...
Into drugs and women.
I hurt a lot of people, John.
But it all caught up to
me, and...
that's when I turned to God.
Sick and broken.
Now He's all I got.
He's everything to me.
You said you grew up here.
I did.
I left Franklin 15 years ago,
running from all my
responsibilities.
I had a child with
my girlfriend.
Then we got hooked on
meth and it took her life.
I left the child with
her grandmother...
then I ran.
I just ran.
Was it a boy or a girl?
Little girl.
She was born on Valentine's Day.
John, are you sure?
She said that her
father passed away.
Maybe that's what she was told.
So you don't think that he did?
Huh.
And you think Barbara told her
that he was dead on purpose?
That's what I'm wondering.
If his influence led to
her daughter's death,
then he abandoned Hannah,
it makes sense that she wouldn't
want anything to do with him.
I'd say that your
assessment is correct.
Why do you say that?
Because I knew her daughter.
You knew Hannah's mother?
We were friends up until
a year before she died.
When this charming
older guy came around,
we warned her to be careful.
She didn't listen.
The next thing we
knew, she was pregnant.
And she cut off all
contact with all of us.
After she gave birth,
she became an addict.
I didn't even know she was dead
until after the funeral.
I went to go see Barbara,
but I just saw bitterness.
I reconnected with her this
year and saw more of the same.
We wondered how Hannah
was able to come here.
You're paying for it.
Thomas Hill is not the same
man, but he is sick.
If he and Hannah were to meet,
it needs to happen
sooner rather than later.
Yeah. Barbara may not be
telling Hannah the truth,
but she still is her guardian.
And how can we go around her?
In my official capacity as
the principal of this school,
I can't advise you
to go around Barbara.
But I can tell you that
if you include her,
Hannah may never
meet her father.
If it was you...
would you want to meet your dad?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
We need to pray.
Mm-hm.
♪ I'm not givin' in ♪♪
Thomas?
John.
How are you?
Put me in, coach.
- Tired of sitting on the bench. Ha-ha.
- Ha-ha.
First, I need to introduce
you to my number one teammate.
- I brought Amy with me.
- Oh, my goodness.
I can honestly say I
did not see that coming.
Hi, Thomas.
It's nice to meet you.
The honor is all mine.
Well, coach brought his wife.
- This must be an important day.
- It is an important day.
We have something that, uh,
we'd like to talk to you about.
Okay, shoot.
You know that I have one
runner that I'm coaching.
Yeah.
Well,
that runner is 15 years old.
She lives with her grandmother.
She was born on Valentine's Day.
Her name is Hannah Scott.
Are you okay?
Your runner...
is my daughter?
Tell me about her.
She's beautiful.
She's quiet.
She's observant.
She's athletic.
We wondered if you
would want to meet.
Does she know about me?
No. We haven't told
her anything yet.
We don't even know
how she would respond,
but we wanted to
talk to you first.
I've had a conversation in my
mind with her a thousand times.
I wanted to talk to her.
What daughter would
want a dad like me?
Thomas, she needs a father.
You still have so
much to offer her.
- She'd be disappointed.
- No. That's not true.
Thomas, would you be
willing to pray about it?
If she's willing to meet...
would you want to?
Yes.
We can pray about it.
Hannah, you've been doing
intervals for a while.
Wanna see if you can
break 21 minutes?
I can break 21 minutes.
- What are you doing here?
- I went to work and they're closed.
Roger told me he's moving
Race to Escape to Fairview.
- So who am I racing?
- You want to run?
I want to see if
Hannah can catch me.
Oh, I want to see this.
You haven't been running.
You think you can handle three miles?
Oh, please.
He is your son.
Ah, ow.
♪ Throw my hands up high and
Shooby, doobee-doobee, doo-wop ♪
♪ Feels so good I got to
Shooby, doobee-doobee, doo-wop ♪
♪ Makes me want to holla ♪♪
You okay?
No.
That was crazy hard.
You said this wasn't a sport.
Yeah, I was wrong.
Mom, Will and Hannah
wanted to see you finish,
but they got tired of
waiting, so they went home.
I need to get a ride with you.
If you'll drive.
All right.
I'm tired.
What?
Hannah Scott!
You got this!
Come on, Hannah!
- You can do it!
- This is all you!
- Did you know Ethan was coming?
- I didn't.
Now, that is my son.
Oh, okay.
Runners, take your marks!
- Come on, Hannah!
- Hannah, you got this!
Hold your spot, hold your spot.
She's 10th.
Come on, fight, Hannah!
Come on, Hannah. You got it!
Come on, Hannah.
- All right, finish strong.
- Go, go, go!
Let's go see her.
Hannah.
You did so good.
That was amazing.
Nice job.
Did you even need your inhaler?
No. What place did I come in?
Uh, you were 11th.
Hey. No, no, no. Don't you be upset.
You just ran your best race.
Yeah, that's right.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
It was fantastic.
I thought I at
least made top 10.
- You keep running like that and you will.
- Yeah.
- You got friends who want to say hello.
- Hannah! That was awesome!
That was your fastest
time you've made yet.
Hannah, can you tell before a race
whether you might have an attack?
Sometimes.
But today, I felt good.
You're a good runner, Hannah.
Ethan said he'd pick up
Will, so we've got time.
So I want to ask you a question.
I want you to think about it, okay?
Who is Hannah Scott?
I don't know.
Do you believe God loves you?
He does.
More than you know.
Why did He take my parents?
I think it's easy
sometimes to blame God
for decisions that we
make or other people make.
What do you know about your dad?
He was a runner.
He got into drugs,
and it killed him.
Your grandmother told you that?
Do you know his name?
Thomas Hill.
Hannah,
I went to the hospital recently,
and I met a man there.
He's not doing very well.
Diabetes has taken his eyesight,
but we've gotten
to know each other.
He used to be a
runner years ago...
and got on drugs.
He had a daughter,
a baby girl,
and he left her with a relative
when he left town 15 years ago.
His name is Thomas Hill.
What?
Hannah, I believe you were told
your father died to protect you.
I don't want to go
around your grandmother,
but I don't know how
much time you have.
My father's alive?
He wants to meet you,
but only if you want to.
Hannah, you don't have to do
anything that you don't want to do.
Why did he leave?
He regrets it.
He regrets it with
his whole heart.
- Hannah?
- In here.
Hey, baby girl.
How'd your race go today?
I finished 11th.
Oh, well, you're improving.
I wish I could have been there.
I thought about you all day at work.
Did you ever see my father run?
Uh... One time at the city race.
He was in his 30s.
And how did he die?
Baby, I already told you this.
The drugs got a hold of him.
You don't need to be worrying about that.
The best thing you can do
is to get on with your life.
He would want that.
So have you eaten?
Because I can whip us up something.
I'm starved.
Okay.
So I'll call you in a few
minutes, okay?
All right, come on. Finish strong.
You got it. Good.
Good, good, good.
Twenty forty-five.
Hannah, you're getting faster.
- How's your breathing?
- Good.
Let me get you some water.
I wanna go.
I wanna go see him.
What about your grandmother?
She said he's dead.
He's right here.
I'll tell you what. Let me step
in there for just a second, okay?
Okay.
Hannah, are you okay?
I'm okay. I'm okay.
If you want more time,
we don't have to do this now.
I want to.
- I'm okay.
- Okay.
Okay, guys. You ready?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Well, Thomas, we're here.
- You've met Amy.
- Hello, Amy.
Hi, Thomas.
It's nice to see you again.
I tried to pick out a better outfit,
but I couldn't tell if anything matched.
Ha-ha. Well, you look just fine.
And Hannah is here.
Hello, Hannah.
Hello.
Coach tells me that you're
his number one runner.
I guess.
- She gets better every day.
- That's good.
I hope you keep at it.
Thomas, I understand that
you were third in state.
Yes, I was, back in the day.
So, Hannah,
how's coach doing?
He's doing okay.
Oh, just okay.
Excuse me.
I need to get his vitals if I
could, please.
Hello, Rose.
- Hi.
- You come to join the party?
I'd love to, but I think I'll
have to take a rain check.
- How are you feeling today?
- Good.
- I need to leave.
- Okay.
If it was good,
yes, that was me.
- I'm gonna go after her.
- Okay.
There we go.
I'm gonna try and get you outside.
Hannah? Hannah.
Are you okay?
Okay, listen.
Let's go sit down in the car, okay?
John will be out,
and he'll be down in a few minutes.
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.
Hannah, would you like me to stay
with you until your grandma gets home?
It's okay. I just...
I need some time to think.
You have our number.
So if you need anything,
please give us a call.
Thank you.
Please tell me we
did the right thing.
How are we doing today?
I don't really
feel like running.
So maybe we take the day off.
Hannah, I'm sorry that taking you
to the hospital caused you pain.
I know that must
have been difficult.
I want to go see him again.
Are you sure?
But this time...
could we talk alone?
Of course.
I didn't say anything
I wanted to say.
Neither did he.
Thank you...
for coming back.
I was worried I said
the wrong thing.
No.
You didn't.
I know you must have
a lot of questions.
You can say anything...
ask anything you want.
I promise to be honest.
What happened?
You know how...
people think that
they're a good person?
I thought I was.
But I wasn't, Hannah.
I lived selfish all my life.
I lived it for me.
I hurt so many people.
Your mother.
Your grandmother.
You.
And so many others.
I left because I was a fool.
And I wouldn't listen to anyone.
Especially God.
I ran from everything
that mattered.
Because God loves me...
He let me be broken.
And I needed to be broken.
He finally got my attention.
And I gave Him my heart...
because that's the
only thing I got left.
So I'm sorry, Hannah.
I'm sorry I wasn't
there for you.
If I could take it all
back, I would.
I know I don't deserve it...
but I pray one day...
that you will forgive me.
It's hard.
I understand.
I understand.
Let's go. Two minutes.
Get to class.
Come on, Dennis. No more tardies.
Don't move in slow motion.
John! I need you tomorrow
for midterm monologues.
Troy, you don't need me.
No, no, no. I do. It's important.
You're a judge.
And I've got a part for you.
You don't have to audition.
- Good, I'm not doing it.
- I've already given you the part.
- You'll love it. We'll talk details soon.
- No, we won't.
Hey, Hannah.
How far do you run in practice?
Three miles. Sometimes five.
Are the Harrisons coming?
No, ma'am. They have tutoring.
But I can still run.
I know you've had a lot
to think about lately.
I've just been wondering
how you're doing.
I met my dad.
That's a big deal.
How'd that go?
He said he was sorry he left.
How did that make you feel?
I still wonder.
I wonder why he didn't want me.
Do you believe he's sorry?
I guess.
You know you have
another Father,
who has always loved you.
You mean God?
Yeah, I do.
And listen,
He's not like your dad.
He's a perfect Father,
and He wants you to know Him.
How do you know God?
God went to great lengths
to express His love for you.
You've heard in Bible class
how Jesus died on the cross.
But do you understand why?
No. Not really.
You were created to know Him...
and to worship Him.
But we reject Him
when we do wrong.
When we sin, that's the thing
that separates us from Him.
So He sent His Son
to pay the price
to get you back.
And it was a painful price.
But then He rose from the dead,
and He made a way for you
to get right with God...
if you trust Him,
if you believe.
That's faith.
But He doesn't force it on you.
He just offers it to you
because He loves you.
We've all sinned, Hannah.
We've all lied or
stolen or hated...
But when we give
our heart to Jesus,
He starts cleaning it.
He takes better care of
it than we ever could.
If we'll trust Him.
Is that something
that you'd like to do?
Yes, but...
I don't know what to pray.
Would it be okay if
I led you through it?
Lord Jesus...
ll am a sinner.
I am a sinner.
And I need a Savior.
And I need a Savior.
I believe that You
are that Savior.
So today...
I place faith alone...
in Christ alone...
to forgive my sins.
Come live in me.
In Jesus' name.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Hannah, that was beautiful.
You know, the Bible says that
when you place faith in Jesus,
you are a brand-new creation.
You are brand-new.
I want you to do something for
me, okay?
There's a book of the
Bible in the New Testament,
it's called Ephesians.
I want you to look at the first
two chapters, read it through,
and write down everything that it
says you are as a believer in Christ.
Can you do that?
Yes, ma'am.

Okay.
Truxston, did you write this?
Every word.
Completely original.
Oy-yoi-yoi.
Bonnie?
I'm gonna need more.
Hmm. John?
It was okay.
Thank you, Truxston.
You can sit down now.
While we're compiling our notes,
the rest of you can get
your things together.
The bell should ring
in about three minutes.
Hannah, you okay?
Ask me who I am.
Ask me who I am.
Who is Hannah Scott?
I am created by God.
He designed me...
so I'm not a mistake.
His Son died for me...
just so I could be forgiven.
He picked me to be His own...
so I'm chosen.
He redeemed me...
so I am wanted.
He showed me grace...
just so I could be saved.
He has a future for me...
because He loves me.
So I don't wonder
anymore, Coach Harrison.
I am a child of God.
I just wanted you to know.
Did you...?
Did you see that?
That's what I'm talking about.
That was fire!
Yes. John!
Why is she not in my class?
Hannah.
What happened to you?
I talked to Miss
Brooks yesterday...
and prayed.
And then I read in,
um, Ephesians...
Yeah.
And it was like God was
talking directly to me.
This is amazing.
What you said in there was amazing.
I want to know more.
I want to read more.
You can.
I want Amy to hear this.
Can we go see her?
- What's your next class?
- English.
- Who's your teacher?
- Miss Leipzig.
Okay.
Hold on, hold up.

Hey, are you looking
for Thomas Hill?
Yes.
Are you a relative?
I'm his daughter.
He's just been moved to
ICU, sweetie.
Do you want me to take you?
Is he okay?
His EKG showed signs of a
heart attack during dialysis,
but he's stable now.
- You can go in.
- Thank you.
Are you okay?
Hannah.
They said you had signs
of a heart attack.
I just need a little excitement.
Sometimes I get a little bored,
and so I decided to shake things up a bit.
Well...
maybe you shouldn't
do that again.
Yeah.
I admit, I don't want to.
So how are you doing?
Well...
I want to tell you something.
Two things, really.
Okay.
I made the decision...
to follow Jesus.
And I've been learning a lot...
and reading a lot.
And one thing I've learned...
if Jesus can forgive me for
all the things I've done...
then I can forgive other people.
So...
I wanted you to know...
that I forgive you.
And I want to spend
more time with you...
if that's okay.
Yes. Ha-ha.
I'd love that so much.
Thank you, Hannah.
I wish I could be there for you.
It's okay.
I don't mind coming here.
Where have you been?
You scared me.
I wasn't feeling well,
so I came home early.
Miss Cole didn't
know where you were.
You wanna tell me?
Hannah.
I want the truth.
- Miss Scott?
- I need to speak to you.
Come on in.
I come home early from work,
expecting to find Hannah there.
And two hours later,
she walks in,
having ridden her bike to the
hospital, where she has been visiting
the one person I vowed
she'd never meet.
Then I find out you
two connected them.
- Mrs. Scott...
- Am not finished!
She's been going there while
I'm at work and not telling me.
I didn't know he was
back in Franklin.
And I don't care
what shape he's in.
He's caused me...
more pain than
anyone in my life.
You had no right to interfere.
It was not your place.
I am the one that raised her.
I am the one that provided for her.
Not him!
She will not see him anymore.
And if you take her there,
I have a right
to bring action
against the school
and against you.
Now I said what I came to say.
John.
What did you say to them?
Are you worried
about their feelings?
How about worrying about the one
that has taken care of
you for the last 15 years?
Hannah,
do you think I'm
trying to hurt you?
I'm trying to protect you.
You don't know him like I do.
Having him in your life is pain.
And I've had enough of that.
You should've told me
instead of deceiving me.
You said he was dead!
I want to know my father.
I don't know what to do.
Please forgive me if
I've jumped ahead of You.
You know I did not
want to hurt them.
Mm-hm.
Lord, we need You.
We need wisdom.
But show us what
You want us to do.
We want to honor You, Lord.
- Please help us. Please, Lord, help us.
- Yes. Yes.
♪ Your love is all
that defines me ♪
♪ You call me by... ♪♪
Is someone there?
I won't let you hurt her.
I wondered when you might come.
Oh, I didn't want to come,
but Hannah is so determined
to learn more about you, and I have
told her about what she might find.
You got every right to hate me.
I can't defend the
wrongs I've done.
And I know I don't
deserve your forgiveness.
But I'm not the
man that you knew.
I only want to love
and to help Hannah.
Help her?
You want to help her?
It's been 15 years,
and now you want to help her?
How are you gonna help her?
You can't even help yourself.
You want to help Hannah?
Leave her alone
and let her go.
You just gave her to me.
Give me the chance to love
her, Lord.
Don't You leave me here useless.
Don't You leave me here useless.
Hey, God.
It's me.
I'm not handling this very well.
God...
I'm working two jobs. I'm trying to
do everything I can do on my own,
and it's not working.
So, look...
if You want me to do
this forgiveness thing,
You got to help me.
Because...
I can't do it anymore.
I can't.
I need Your help, God.
Good afternoon.
We have three rule changes
for consideration this year.
A few of our schools
have requested
that runners be allowed to
wear earbuds during a race.
Now, while this association can
modify the rules for our events,
we have two problems
with this request.
One, we need runners to hear
any signals or warning sounds
during the race, and secondly,
any live communication to the runner
would give them an unfair advantage.
So we have a solution that we
are presenting to you coaches
to vote on for this race.
If a runner wears only one small earbud
and the content is prerecorded only,
we will allow it,
pending your vote.
- Any questions?
- This is ridiculous.
- Yes?
- And the content is fair game,
- as long as it's prerecorded?
- That is right.
There is no live communication.
All right.
We will just go around the room,
and get a yes or no vote
from each of you. Paul?
Uh, Cindy, I see problems with this.
I vote no.
Sounds good to me. I'm a yes.
I think it's a little late in the
year for a change like that. I'm a no.
I vote yes.
Say yes.
Say yes. Say yes.
Sure. Whatever.
Ethan, hey, I need a favor.
See if you can find a picture
of the Sherwood College
cross-country course.
Okay, Gina Mimms won
the state championship
on this course last year with a
time of 19 minutes and 45 seconds.
I need to know where she would be
at any given point during the race.
Why do you need to know that?
- We're gonna help Hannah.
- Okay.
Hold it as steady as you can.
- Got it.
- What's our time, Will?
Um, two fifteen,
2:16, 2:17, 2:18...
What is this again?
The state championship
race is this Saturday.
You've wanted to be there for Hannah.
Now you're going to.
I'm gonna walk you through the course
and then you're gonna coach her.
Welcome to the Cross-Country
State Championship.
All runners please check
in at the starters table.
- Hannah, how you doing?
- I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Yeah, I bet half the girls out here
feel that way. Here's your chip.
- You lace it up tight.
- Okay.
You're gonna do great
today, Hannah, okay?
Don't be nervous.
This is just another race, okay?
No, it's not. It's a huge race.
I'm nervous.
- That's not helping, John.
- I'm sorry.
Uh, you got your inhaler?
Okay, good.
- Is your grandma gonna be staying?
- She has work soon.
I don't think she can
stay for the race.
Hey, check out the stands.
You got a cheering section today.
Looking good, girls. Stay loose.
Hey, see those four girls?
That's your only competition.
That's Anna Grant, Catherine Austin,
Joy Taylor, and Julia Mitchell.
No one else is a threat.
Stay loose.
Hey, Hannah.
I need you to do something for me.
I'm gonna take your arm,
I'm gonna strap this on.
I want you to put this earpiece
on, okay?
Okay. What is this?
There's only one track on it.
As soon as the race starts,
I want you to hit play.
All runners to
the starting line.
Let me help you.
- Is this music?
- Nope.
- You hit play and start running.
- Okay.
I want you to trust me.
Okay, you can go to the starting line.
Okay.
Now I'm nervous.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Runners, take your mark.
Hannah, this is your dad.
I'm gonna coach you
through this race
and be with you every
step of the way.
We're gonna do this together.
Just stay with me.
Go, go, go!
Don't burn yourself
out too early.
Settle into an even pace.
About 70 percent
of your max speed.
But we're gonna need to save
some energy for the end.
You don't win races
with just your legs.
Victory or defeat happens
in your head first.
This is a mental competition.
So I want you to start
thinking like a winner.
I'm your biggest fan.
You're gonna do great today.
Now find a girl in front of you
and speed up for a few
seconds to pass her.
Then find your pace again.
We're going to take
them out one at a time.
When your body tells you that you
can't do it, don't listen to it.
It'll tell you that
you should quit.
But you tell your body that
your mind is in charge today.
Give God your best, Hannah,
and no matter what,
I love you.
Where is she?
She should be at the first hill.
Right now,
you're coming to your first hill.
A lot of girls are gonna slow
down, but not you.
You're going to
attack this hill.
! want you to pump
your arms hard.
Your legs are
gonna speed up too.
Pick out the next girl in
front of you and pass her.
You can do this, Hannah.
! know you can.
Get after it.
When you get to the other side,
let gravity do the work.
Take advantage of
that free speed,
then find your pace again.
You're doing great, Hannah.
Even if your legs start to hurt,
don't slow down.
That can make them
hurt even more.
Keep your pace and push through.
You'll find a second wind.
The first mile is done.
You're doing it, Hannah.
Don't look back to
see who's behind you.
Don't worry about them.
Focus on what's ahead.
It's just like in life.
You can't let the
past slow you down.
Press on to what's ahead.
When we give our life over to
God, He helps us. He forgives us.
He can turn the bad to
good and carry us forward.
Hey, John. Are you not going with
the other coaches to the midpoint?
Uh, I'm not coaching her today.
She's got a better coach.
Okay.
Hannah, having you in my
life is an answer to prayer.
I asked God for it,
but I knew I didn't deserve it.
I begged Him to forgive me
for not being there for you.
One of the greatest blessings in my life
has been getting to know my daughter.
I praise God for you, Hannah.
You don't know how
proud I am of you.
I wake up every morning
with a smile on my face,
ready to pray for you.
I've been praying that you
would know that I love you
and that God loves you.
He says, "I know the plans
that I have for you."
Plans to prosper you
and not to harm you.
"Plans to give you
hope and a future."
I've been praying for
your grandmother too.
That He would help her
and draw her to Himself.
Hannah,
the second mile is behind you.
One more to go.
Find your breathing rhythm
because we have one
more hill coming up.
This is where you'll
pass another girl.
Remember, attack this hill.
If someone is in front of you,
fight past her.
You can shake her
hand after the race.
Big breath, Hannah.
Now take the hill.
We have another update.
- With half a mile to go...
- Okay.
It's Gina Mimms in first,
Anna Grant in second
- and Joy Taylor in third.
- Oh...
Hannah, if you're like me,
this is where your
body hits a wall.
But we're gonna push through it.
This is where you
think like a winner.
Most runners will slow
down, but not you.
You have half a mile to
go, and it belongs to you.
If your legs are
burning, let them burn.
Your lungs may be tired,
but they're not done yet.
Other runners are
feeling the same thing.
You've got to get
yourself in position.
Your last kick is coming.
If anyone is in front of you,
you got to get around them.
Don't let anyone block you.
Gina Mimms should be
coming out of the woods.
You're near the finish line,
and we're gonna finish strong.
You're about to come
out of the woods.
If Coach Harrison is right,
the lead runner is about
30 yards in front of you.
It's almost time to kick it in.
This is where you pull
all your reserves.
This is where you leave
it all on the course.
Now, my daughter, it's time.
Hannah,
track her down.
There's Gina.
There she is.
- Is that...?
- That's Hannah.
- Run, Hannah!
- You got to go!
Come on, Hannah!
- Run!
- Whoo!
Gina! Go! Gina, now! Now!
You can do this.
Give it everything.
- Catch her, Hannah.
- Catch her, Hannah!
Extend your stride.
Pump your arms.
- Fight it, Hannah!
- Come on! Catch her, Hannah!
- Fight!
- Yeah! Right there!
- Go, Hannah!
- Fight! Come on!
Keep your eyes on the finish
line and fight for it.
I'm right here with you.
You can do this.
I can see you winning.
I can see you winning.
Do it, Hannah!
Do it, my daughter!
- Do it, Hannah!
- Gina! Go!
- Fight, Hannah!
- Whoo!
Go, Hannah!
- Go, Hannah!
- Go! Go!
Hannah.
- Hannah, come on. Hannah?
- Hannah? Hannah?
- Breathe for me. You got oxygen?
- Sit her up. Breathe.
She needs oxygen.
Come on, Hannah. Stay with me.
- You got it, Hannah. Come on.
- Take some deep breaths.
We got to move her.
We've got runners coming.
- Come on. Move her.
- We need to move her.
- What happened?
- She just fell.
I think she just passed out.
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.
Did anybody see who won?
I feel bad for her.
- Way to go.
- Nice job.
Right here.
I think you're gonna be okay.
I hope you feel better.
- Thanks, guys. Thank you.
- Yeah. Thank you.
You doing okay?
Hey.
I'm very proud of you.
You've never run better.
- You were amazing.
- You did amazing.
I gave everything I had.
I believe it.
Young lady, you doing okay?
- I'm okay.
- That was quite a finish. A little scary too.
I understand you've
never won a race before.
No, sir.
Well, you have now.
We actually had to go
back and look at the video
because the computer
had the identical time.
It turns out you were leaning
forward an inch more than she was.
Congratulations.
You just won the state championship.
You did it, Hannah.
Yeah!
Hannah, you did it.
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!
Yes! Go, Hannah!
Oh, you did it.
You did it, you did it, you did it.
Come on.
- Go, Hannah!
- Hannah!
Hannah! Hannah!
Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!
Yes!
In first place,
and this year's
individual state champion,
from Brookshire
Christian School,
Hannah Scott.
Yes.
- Grandma, you stayed.
- Yes.
I'm late for work,
but it was worth it.
I am so...
I'm so proud of you.
Thanks.
I want to go see my father.
Just get her home safe.
Thank you.
For everything.
He's gonna be so excited.
I hear three sets
of footsteps coming.
Hey, Thomas. How are you?
I've been on pins
and needles all day.
- How is everybody?
- We're good, Thomas.
Hey, Daddy.
And how is my daughter?
You won a medal.
Thomas,
that's not just any medal.
You mean to tell me...
my daughter won the race?
I had a really good coach.
Come here.
Thank You, Lord.
Thank You, Lord,
for all You've done.
Thomas Hill's life is a
testimony of redemption,
of the grace of God
and God's power to
change a man's heart.
So we take comfort today
that he no longer suffers,
and is now alive and well
in the presence of the Lord.
For Jesus said,
"I am the resurrection and the life."
He who believes
in Me shall live,
"even if he dies."
Hannah, are you okay?
I want you to know your dad
was a very good friend to me,
and I grew to love and
respect him very much.
Me too.
For six weeks...
I had the best dad in the world.
At some point,
you will ask yourself
who you really are.
! used to struggle with that.
I felt like I was a mistake...
and had no place in this world.
I felt unloved and unwanted.
I got so many mixed messages
from the world around me...
that I lived in confusion
most of the time.
But when I met the
One that created me,
I found my identity.
It doesn't come from
what the culture says,
or even how I feel
at any given time.
The Creator gets to
define His creation.
I still have good
days and bad days.
I still have struggles.
But through all of that,
I know that the One who loves me
and died for me is with me.
He overcame everything for me.
Sin, suffering and death.
So I walk with Him every day.
I trust in Him every day.
And since my identity
is found in Him,
I know exactly who I am.
Happy Valentine's Day, Hannah.
Today should be
your 21st birthday.
I want to tell you that I love
you and that God loves you.
