We've got a major failure in booster number 1!
The rocket is going off course.
Self-destruct.
OK, I'm logged onto the satellite. Bringing up soybean prices right now.
What's he talking about? It's still going up!
No, before it collapses, I'll instruct you to sell.
OK, good.
I'll sort out my divorce, I should be back tomorrow.
Yeah, sure. OK, good night, buddy.
Me, too. Let's call it a day.
I appreciate that.
Excuse me, sorry, let me through!
Hi, I'm Stephen Marchado.
~ Mr. Markado. ~ Marchado.
~ I'm Pierre Bonaventure, your counselor.
Welcome to Venezuela.
~ The Paris office sent me all the papers.
~ Excellent.
~ I'd push myself, but...
~ Yes, of course.
Listen, I'm in a big hurry. What time are we meeting with the judge?
Well, there is still a little problem with your lady.
What is it? She doesn't want a divorce?
No, no, no, that's not the problem.
The problem is that the court hasn't been made aware of your request for a divorce.
I sent it to the post office in Cavayano,...
but no one has come to claim it.
What? I traveled 4,000 miles for nothing?
I'm a busy man. I'm remarrying next month.
Mr. Marchado --- I am no miracle worker.
Go to Cavayano and come back here with your wife...
and the paperwork.
I'll arrange an immediate appointment with the French Consul, my brother-in-law.
Where's Cavayano?
Cavayano --- here it is.
It's the butt of the world.
Christ! Any more great news.
I'll wait for you.
I've rented a plane. I'll try to manage it all in one day.
~ Please remember you have to be here for the great conference...
that Suguku is giving in two days.
Listen, I'll do my very best, Charlotte!
~ He has happily agreed to perform the wedding.
~ Great.
Oh, Steve, I love you!
I love you, too, Baby.
All right, OK, let's get cracking!
Ah, Mr. Machado, live with wife, not with strife.
As my dear old mama, God rest her soul, used to say:
'You break it, you buy it!'
You're a very lucky man, Mr. Marchado.
We haven't had such good weather in weeks!
And as my wise old father, God rest his soul,...
used to say, the fool dances in the rain...
while the wise man swims.
It was taken 13 years ago so she might have changed a little.
She hasn't come down to collect her mail for weeks on end.
Ask him if he knows where she lives.
~ In Lipolipo.
~ Lipolipo!
I'm not hearing this, Stevie! I'm not hearing this, partner!
No, Steve. You have to be back by tomorrow morning. I mean pronto!
Rossberg is going through the roof!
Be cool, Richard! I'm stuck out here, man. She lives in the sticks.
~ I don't even know how to get there.
~ By water, Mr. Marchado.
~ What?
~ I have to sell the soybeans before the weekend.
~ Do I dump them on Chicago?
~ No, hold them! I'll decide after the Tokyo exchange opens.
~ Right --- what was the name of that village?
~ Lipolipo.
Hey, you're wrong, Mr. Marchado! You might need me there!
~ As my late mother used...
~ Just live with it.
That's what my late stepmother used to say.
Listen, Pal, you said it wasn't very far but we left more than 3 hours ago.
This is it: Lipolipo!
This is Lipolipo?
You've got to be kidding me. I don't believe this!
All right, I'll go and ask. I'll be back in 5 minutes.
Shut up. I'm paying you a fortune, you can wait for 5 minutes!
Hello.
I'm looking for a white woman.
Her name is Patricia Marchado.
That's her. Have you seen her?
Patricia Marchado.
Paliku! Paliku!
Patricia?
Patricia?
It's me, Steve.
You remember me?
It's a bad time. The pig is delivering.
Wait for me outside.
"Wait for me outside." She must be kidding me...I must be dreaming.
This can't be real.
OK, we were married for a year.
One day she drops me like a dog turd, with no explanation.
Of course, after that not even a postcard.
God knows how I finally managed to track her down.
13 years, 4,000 miles, and I find her in this slum...
and I've got to wait for Miss Piggy's birthday party?!
Get real, will you?
You want a divorce?
~ Well, uh...yeah.
~ Well, it's OK by me.
Listen, Patricia...
~ I've got...
~ Paliku...my Indian name is Paliku and this is Pontipee.
Good morning, Madam.
OK, Paliku. I would love to sit and talk but we got to get going.
~ We've got papers to sign at the embassy and then...
~ Oh, look, isn't he the cutest?
Look, you'll be back tomorrow night, and I'll pay for everything.
Oh, but tomorrow is the children's ceremony. I can't miss it.
How about the day after?
No, it's impossible. Impossible!
Listen,... Patricu...you've got a party but I've got important business affairs that I can't miss, either.
I've really got to go. My raft is double-parked...
No, not any more. They're waving the boat good bye.
He couldn't wait for you.
What's he doing? Come back! I'll buy you a real boat!
Don't leave me here!
I can't believe this.
Get away from my stuff! Come on, leave it alone!
Hey, kids, they're not toys.
Please don't eat the batteries. Where's your mother?
Steve! Muluku says you're welcome to sleep with the bachelors.
Or you could go Pontipee if you want. She just loves blue eyes.
Are you hungry?
No. Do you know the chief is wearing my Pepto-Bismol?
There's something you don't know, Steven.
Oh, but there's a lot of things I don't know anything about.
Like who won the gold medal in shot-put at the Moscow Olympics.
Like why you left me 13 years ago...
Hold it, hold it. For the gold medal I have the answer.
It was Kiszeljev at 65 feet.
And I left you because of the fifth telephone line.
Excuse me?
A man rang at the door and said he was coming by to put in the fifth line.
He asked me if I was the secretary...
and then I realized that I was nothing more than one of your secretaries...
and when it rang, I took my things and left, bags and all.
The phone guy --- was he Indian?
That's right. But I wasn't alone.
I left because I loved you deeply.
Obviously, of course. People do that.
You loved me so you left me. I understand that.
As a matter of fact, it worked out fine.
I haven't slept for two years, I became the top broker for Asia,...
because nobody else was up when Hong Kong opened.
This is hard to say. Give me a break and listen to me.
I'm listening. I'm all ears, I'm stranded here for two days, I've got nothing but time.
I'm listening...
Damn, Tokyo!
Are you there, Richard? OK...I'm hooking up with Tokyo.
Great set of teeth, huh?
Absolutely unbelievable.
We all work through satellites these days.
Two weeks ago, we bought 4,500 hundred tons of soybeans in Hong Kong...
and now we're selling it in Tokyo.
Oh, my. So as I was saying, I didn't leave alone.
See that --- $172...it's dropped a bit.
I was expecting your child.
That's not serious...come on, come on...
I left with your son.
$171 bucks...don't panic, don't panic...
I had always dreamed of the Amazon so I came here to have my baby...
to raise him in the forest. With all the furry animals.
Up 25 cents per ton...you got to be kidding me!
Should you care to meet him, Steven, he's right over there.
Ah --- up 75 cents per ton...there's no more bidders. Time is up!
OK, sell, big boy!...Come on...
Yes, Baby's got a new pair of shoes!
What did she say?
Patricia, wait. What was that about?
You have a son, you hear?
My son, but what son? Where?
Your son. Right behind you.
What is this all about?
It's simple. It's about a pregnant woman who blew a fuse...
and settled in the New World to raise her baby...
because her family has become a company, where she could only be the mother of a junior vice president...
of Marchado, Marchado, and Son.
But do you realize what you've done?
What are you, insane?
Well, yes!
You used to love that.
Oh --- his name is Mimi-Siku.
It means cat piss.
OK, it's weird...but the children get to choose their own names here.
You have to respect his choice.
This is a damn nuthouse!
Hey --- what makes you so sure I am the father?
I never loved another man.
I haven't told him yet, and I won't --- unless you want me to.
What are you doing? Don't touch it!
Don't touch it, don't touch it!
Guys! Guys! Chief! Break it up!
Hands off. Don't touch, what have you done? What have you done?
Damn it! Oh, man, they've done it, the battery's gone!
Where do you...?
Mimi-Siku?
I think you should know...
Steven...Steven...Steve!
Mimi-Siku wants to show you the forest.
Mimi-Siku?
Mimi-Siku.
Oh, yeah.
~ Too bad it's not a dream.
~ Go on, he's waiting.
I saw him last night in some girl's hammock.
Oh, my last saucepan. He steals them all.
What does he need them for?
You know, here, it's like flowers. It makes a nice gift.
~ Oh...
~ He's so popular.
In this?...Right.
More water, great!
~ Baboons! Baboons!
~ Baboons! Baboons! Yes, I know.
~ "Tunas...tunas."
~ "Tunas" --- water.
~ "Okko...Okko."
~ "Okko" --- parrot.
~ Ok...ko.
~ Yeah, parrot.
No. Okko is Okko. Parrot is pampoko.
Hold on. You speak French?
Yes. Paliku teach  me. "Mary carved a little ham.
"Mary carved a little ham and its fleas where white as snow.
"Now you go to bed. That's all for today.
"But if you want me to, I'll teach you the rest."
Me trade! Me trade! Vali! Vali!
Nugget! Nugget!
Beauty!
Hey, listen: you gave him a gold nugget for that stupid pot?
You could have bought his whole family with that!
Me very best trade. No gold nugget, bad shiny rock.
God damn it, what the hell was that?
Oh, my God!
Burudu.
For you.
Afraid?
~ Is this a dangerous snake?
~ Yes. Burudu give death. Body swell.
Neck break. Nose piss blood.
Are you really sure it's dead. It just twitched.
~ Sleep like log --- but now it dead.
You stay with me always now?
Well, I'd love to but I really can't...I'm not used to the jungle like you are.
Kwatta --- is monkey guts. Much very good.
Love to but I'm stuck on snake.
If you stay, me teach you fishing, hunting, and trading.
I'm already a big-time trader. Number one trader.
Me go back home tomorrow, and do very big trade.
This in home of you? Big arrow piercing sky like necklace big grandfather Muluku?
Of course --- yeah, the Eiffel Tower. It's in my home town.
And it big? You take me Eiffel Tower?
Yeah, well --- sure, maybe we'll go some day.
When me a man, you take me Eiffel Tower.
OK, when you're a man.
Wow, that's ripe.
Mimi --- Mimi, watch out! Mimi, don't move!
Don't move, Mimi --- a spider, a huge spider!
Don't even think about it, Pal. Stop right there.
Back! Back!
Don't force me to kick your ass!
It's not the way it looks, Mimi! I'm not afraid of spiders, I'm just allergic!
All right, you're road pizza!
All right, you're not!
Easy, My-oteka!
You no shout. If you shout, My-oteka attacking!
My-oteka very nice but kikouyay more meaner.
Kikouyay you afraid more.
Who's kikouyay?
This is a jungle cruise from hell!
It's your name here. Hairy chests make them laugh!
It reminds them of monkeys.
No way, I'm not going to smoke that!
Relax. It's part of the ritual here.
Thank you but no thank you. I've already seen more than my share of giant bugs today.
He'll be offended.
What's he saying?
He's telling the forest the boys are about to become real men.
What? What's he saying?
He's saying he's proud of Mimi-Siku, and that you as his father should be proud as well.
Of course I'm proud of Cat Piss, it's one tough Bar Mitzvah!
Yeah, but you stay on his case. I just want him to keep it up during next semester, Chief.
Because sometimes, after you've had good grades, you let it slide...
and next thing you know you're busted for hot-wiring a canoe. Know what I mean?
Me be man, now, Baboon.
Me want to take Grandfather Muluku with us. Tomorrow, Paris!
~ That's nice.
~ To Paris? You live Paris?
What's this about Paris?
You promised to take Mimi to Paris when he became a man.
Well, he is now, and he wants to take Muluku with him.
No, no, hold it. It's out of the question! I won't take Machu Picchu or anyone else to Paris.
Just you and me go the embassy in Caracas, OK?
We sign divorce and me take big steel bird back to Paris as planned. Is that understood?
~ You make wakatepe with me.
~ Well, did you promise him or not?
Yeah, I promised him he'd go one day and I'll keep my promise, but certainly not tomorrow.
No, I'm overworked, I'm getting remarried, forget it, no!
Someday, tomorrow, I'm overworked. But none of these words have any meaning here.
I never explained them to the kid.
Sweetheart, don't blame me if you're a bunch of ignoramuses.
I can't even understand a word the kid says. What a mother --- you should be locked away!
~ And if you think for a moment I won't call child welfare...
~ Why did you have to come here?
You can't even keep a promise to your own son!
I can't believe I got angry.
Since I left you that hasn't happened to me.
Do you realize that?
Sir?
~ I'm sorry, excuse me.
~ Yeah?
Would you mind asking the young man who's with you...
to stop urinating on the left front door of the plane?
Sorry about that.
Happy be with you, Baboon.
You got any information, any news?
What about?
The beans, Pal, the soy beans.
This morning they were at $149 a ton.
~ What a mess! What a mess!
~ What do you mean, what a mess?
~ Haven't you sold?
~ Of course not.
Of course not --- you didn't confirm the order, so what did you expect?!
~ This can't be true!
~ But you always confirm your orders.
Richard, you must be brain dead. I said sell, you should have sold.
What's with the stranger? Beat it, I'm out of change.
~ Don't worry, he's my son.
~ You've got a son?
Who's going to buy this frigging option now?
That's why it looks so bad bad bad! And Rossberg's so pissed off he won't cover for us.
~ You bet he won't cover that big of a screw-up.
~ Well, thank God you're back...
This way sir --- your bag.
Me no trade today.
Well, you know, he's...uh...
So where'd you get him?
In the forest. He's never been anywhere. He's Patricia's son.
I brought him back to show him there's more to life than monkey guts.
Monkey guts? What do you mean?
~ I'll explain later.
~ But is Charlotte up to speed about him?
No, Charlotte, just the usual jet lag, you know. Apart from that everything's fine.
No, everything went well. You've got a surprise?
Well, so do I.
~ Have fun with Charlotte.
~ Give me a break.
Wait here with Richard.
Charlotte?
Charlotte?
Charlotte?
Steve, Darling, here I am!
The wedding dress --- new age!
~ Beautiful...
~ That's it --- I've fixed the date.
It'll be the 12th. The 12th! Won't it be lovely?
Well, yeah, I'm overwhelmed...but why the 12th?
Well, because it will be so Zen. It's the peak of our metabolic and cosmic awareness.
~ It couldn't be any better...the 12th!
~ I'm sure it'll be wonderful, but...
I'm afraid it's a tad bit too early...at least for me.
~ You haven't divorced?
~ Yeah yeah yeah...well, almost.
The last of the papers are en route --- it's just a formality.
Master Dong had it all worked out --- the moon ascending,  biorhythms in harmony...
third term of the year of the dog.
And if we don't marry on the twelfth, it means we'll end up --- oh my --- in the year of the pig.
We can't be married in the year of the pig.
Pigs can be very beautiful. I met one once...
No, it's a major problem.
Charlotte...
Charlotte...there is another problem.
What is it, dear?
But it's not a major problem at all.
He's not in? Well, tell Mr. Fouat to call me back at once. I have an excellent deal to offer him.
In my car, yeah. He's got the number.
~ Gift for My-oteka.
~ Oh, great. That should make her day.
~ Who's My-oteka?
~ Good friend of me.
Oh, yeah? And what did you say your name was?
Mimi-siku.
Mimi...sikoo?
Or Mimi-Siku. Pronounce it as you wish. It means Cat Piss.
He, uh, made up this name, because over there they choose a name of their own.
It's as if we chose a name like Steering Wheel, or Garden Chair...any type of invented name.
~ Did I tell you what Lapsu said about pain?
~ No.
How blindly one follows the path of life, hoping to find a small pearl along the road.
Well, you see, your son is that small pearl.
Well, excuse me, but I must prepare for this...
Knock it off!
He made me stop at every floor!
~ Well?
~ Oh, it'll be fine, don't worry.
I got an idea, I'd like to give it a try. I'm going to use your phone.
Mimi, come and meet Charlotte. Come on.
Charlotte...Charlotte...
I just wanted you to meet my son, Mimi-Siku.
Oh, hello, Small Pearl.
No, cut it out. Come on, come on. Stop that!
Cut it out, all right?
Will you please stop it!
Mr. Dunbar please. Tell him it's Richard Montillac.
And you see over here --- this is your room. It's where you're going to sleep.
And this here is very important --- it's the bathroom.
You know, like I showed you on the plane, OK?
~ Steve, come quick!
~ Yeah, coming.
~ No, no, I'll hold.
~ I'll be over here with Richard, OK?
~ Mr. Dunbar?
~ # Yes. #
Well, it's about an investment with a major short-term dividend potential.
# I'm afraid I'm not looking for something like that, Montillac. #
I haven't called anyone else about this, all right?
I've got the opportunity to get a hold of 4,500 tons of soy beans, but we've got to move fast.
# Are you out of your mind? Take a hike! #
What a mess, what a mess!
OK, now what? I'm going crazy!
I really don't need this right now.
Baboon! Baboon! Baboon!
~ Oh, God, Mimi.
~ Is there...is there, Eiffel Tower.
~ Mimi, don't look down, you hear me!
~ Why not?
~ Mimi, get down! Get down right now, you hear!
Is large village you have.
How long is he supposed to stay in Paris, exactly?
Oh, what a mess, what a mess, what a mess!
We lost another tenth of a point. We can't even give the stuff away.
~ Some caviar, Richard?
~ Good evening.
~ Don't wait for me, I've got to feed little Buddha.
~ I already fed the cat, Baby.
Thanks, how thoughtful. Good evening, Mimi.
~ Say hello, Mimi.
~ My name is Charlotte...
but you can call me Steering Wheel or Patio Furniture...
it's up to you, Dear. So glad to meet you.
~ It's nothing, Darling. It's their way of saying hello.
~ So I see.
He's a genuine little cave man, isn't he?
Cat like eat a lot. Give good food to cat.
After, when we eat fat cat, fat cat much very good.
Oh...well, he's not such a nice little savage, Dear!
Don't listen to him, Buddha. Come with Mummy, Darling.
Excuse me --- I have to call Master Dong. All my chakras are closing up one after another.
Yeah, you do that.
~ What's she got closing up?
~ Her chakras.
Chakras. Cosmic energy entry points.
~ When they close up, she gets...
~ Where do you find these women, huh?
~ They're all slightly psychotic.
~ Oh, come on...
Mmmm. Your woman make good food.
Well, he's colorful, but it's a bit hard to focus when he's around.
You taking him to the office?
No, you can't take him to the office.
I was waiting for the confirmation --- I would have sold at once.
Oh, we had a good strategy. OK, we had a slight communication problem...
We're not supposed to have our investors lose money.
Look, Mr. Rossberg, we kept our losses at a reasonable level --- barely 9%.
Well, maybe a bit more, but not much...
Gift for friend.
For me? Thank you, that's very nice...
but I've got a lot of those at home.
~ You many saucepans?
~ Oh, yes, many of those.
Large ones, medium ones, small ones...
You many bedtime friends.
Don't mess with me, OK? You think I'll put a note...
in the financial report to apologize for your utter incompetence?
You like my lighter, huh?
It's yours, take it.
It went from 149 to 140 and tomorrow give me 120...
~ There's 4,500 tons of it.
~ Figure it out for yourself.
~ This time, you're really up shit creek.
~ What a disaster.
If we're considered responsible --- and that's the way it looks ---
YOU will have to pay, because I'm certainly not going to.
My advice is that you find a solution and fast, or I'll be wearing your butts for loafers.
What's with him?
Stop hollering.
He's got a point...
I'll holler if I want to. I want to remind you...
that when I decided to make you my associates,...
I had one purpose in mind: and that was...
~ Profit.
~ Right!
Losses!
Up there! Up there! It's up there, it's up there!
You'd better get security! Call 911. Up there, up there!
I think you've upset him.
Look what they're doing!
[Aside] Pick that up at once!
~ Where? Where?
~ Get them on the phone! Do whatever you can!
My-oteka!
~ There it is!
~ Oh, my God!
Over there!
Perfect --- it's under control!
Look, you've really got to get some sleep. You're a nervous wreck!
You don't seem to --- Mr. Benedict, please!
Mr. Benedict....
Get rid of the vicious hairball. You can't keep that thing here!
My-oteka always sleeping. My-oteka eat and sleeping.
Be sure --- always sleeping, or SCRITCH!
~ He hung up!
~ Of course, wouldn't you?
If you'd just confirmed it...
~ Excuse me?
~ Well, but it might have...
Whoa! Tell him to stop that or I'll tie him to the bumper!
Stop that, Mimi.
See that? He's bright. He figured it out all on his own!
Yeah yeah yeah...he's a real jungle genius.
Yow! Tell Einstein to cut the crap!
Stop it, Mimi!
I'll help you take care of him but you've got to make up your mind.
Two years ago when I wanted a baby, you refused.
You said it would be a burden, that we had to live in the fast lane...
that you had to put your career first, and it hurt me a lot.
If it hadn't been for Master Dong, I would never have recovered my balance...
and now you bring me a child --- your own child --- already fully grown...
and who frankly doesn't belong here.
I mean it's like having a big dog in an apartment. It is so unkind.
Plus, your divorce is getting held up. Well, excuse me, but shoot and double shoot.
OK, time out --- back to square one.
Could I remind you it's because you wanted us to get married on the 12th...
that I had to go half way around the world to get a divorce.
Where does that leave us? Here, in Paris, with 4,500 tons of soybeans for sale,...
a threat of imminent bankruptcy, plus Dances With Wolves upstairs,...
and if anyone should say...shoot and double shoot...it's going to be me!
What am I going to do with you now?
Mimi, what have you done?
Oh, Mimi, you just can't do that here.
We don't have to hunt birds.
Let me show you what we eat.
There, you see? Breakfast!
Be right back.
~ Hello.
~ Right, Steve, I'm with a business attorney, Mr. Jonavisky.
He's got a potential investor for us. Be down in 5 minutes, meet you out front.
Charlotte...I'll call you later. Ciao.
Mimi!...Mimi, I've got to go out for a while...
to take care of a trade. You just wait here for me.
~ It's very important to learn how to wait.
~ Me go trade with Baboon.
No, no, that's impossible.
~ I've got too many obligations.
~What 'obligations'?
Obligations are things you have to do. You don't have a choice...
even if it's something you hate.
Me want to go Eiffel Tower.
Mimi --- I'm sorry but I can't go today. We'll go on Sunday.
You just stay here with Charlotte.
Be very nice to Charlotte, huh? Always smile!
And...you no kill animals! You no hunt! Me bring back food, OK?
Baboon come back fast.
Be a good boy!
Babooooon! Babooooon!
Mimi, I know, but Baboon come back, Baboon come back.
Don't expect too much. He won't be jumping.
Me want to see Eiffel Tower.
Steven, this is counselor John Jonavisky, business attorney.
Food time, My-oteka! My-oteka!
My-oteka! My-oteka!
My-oteka!
My-oteka! My-oteka?
Baboon much lucky!
"Baboon much lucky!" Really!
My investor friends are people who consider human beings...
and their word of honor are as good if not better than...
a paper you sign. It's a different mentality.
"Hi, leave me a message after the beep."
Charlotte, I won't make it in time for lunch. We're meeting some potential investors.
Sorry, it might run a little late. There's really nothing I can do about it.
Oh, and I need a big favor, my Love --- could you fix lunch for Mimi-Siku?
I'd really appreciate it. I know you two will really hit it off.
Maybe you could teach him one of your meditation exercises.
I'll be home as soon as possible. Good bye, Darling.
You sound worried. You shouldn't be.
I mean, she'll probably get used to him. He's a nice kid, after all.
So you have a son, Mr. Marchado?
~ That's right.
~ Oh, what a joy. Children are the salt of the earth.
Alas, I'll never have a son to bear my own name.
Mrs. Jonavisky is unfortunately infertile.
As my departed mama told me on the night of my honeymoon: "Son, you break it, you buy it".
That's funny, you say that, too?
Oh, my God, it just whizzed by my face and the poor bird was skewered.
It zoomed by like lightning...but I'm glad it didn't suffer.
Here, just over there on the shutter.
Where, Mrs. Godette, I can't see a thing.
Oh, but I saw it. I'm sure it was there.
One of those Indian things that fly.
~ A carpet?
~ Oh, no, one of those big pointy things.
Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind. The things Indians shoot in the air.
~ An arrow?
~ An arrow. It was long and straight. Look here.
I'm sure I saw someone shooting from that window.
~ Who? Mr. Marchado?
~ I promise you, I swear. It was a big long one.
Mmmm. A long straight arrow, huh? I'll keep a look out.
Oh --- If you see any more Indians, call me at once and I'll put on my cowboy outfit.
For food. Food.
My investor friends eschew luxury like the Sheratons and Hiltons and Plazas of this world.
Oh, well, that's reassuring. Overheads are such a killer here.
Jovushka!
~ Mr. Montillac, Mr. Marchado.
~ Hello, hello!
~ How do you do, sir?
~ How welcome, Pavel!
[Russian]
~ Be seated.
~ Thanks very much.
~ How do you do?
~ This is Pavel's sister.
Petyushka, translate!
Mr. Koutchnoukov is listening.
I'm sure you're very aware of the tense situation on the soy bean market at the moment.
Yevgeny proposes a toast to our successful deal.
But wait --- we haven't even discussed the terms of payment.
Best of friends offer the best guarantees.
Have no worry. Their youngest brother is a part-time ambassador.
~ Wonderful. When do we start?
~ Tomorrow, if you wish.
Excuse me.
Yeah. Yeah, I can hear you.
Thank you, officer. Sorry about that.
Why didn't you stay in the apartment? I told you to wait.
Me go see Eiffel Tower.
Listen, Mimi, I'm glad you're here...
but you're an obligation I'm not prepared to deal with, OK?
~ So don't make things more difficult than they are!
~ Obligation?!
Mimi!
Mimi!
You say obligation.
Stop, Mimi, come back!
Mimi!
Mimi!
Mimi! Mimi! I'm very happy to have you with me, but this is a city, you understand?
You can't run around between the cars like that, it's dangerous!
To visit a monument, you buy a ticket, with money!
You can't kill birds and you have to dress properly.
I know it's hard to understand --- but you've got to learn!
Do you promise to learn?
~ Get in.
~ Hey, move it. I haven't got all day!
~ Up yours!
~ Up oars!
Me learn well, Baboon?
~ You OK, Mimi?
~ Feet learn very slow --- hurt much.
I see. Well, don't worry, don't worry.
A circle is a square.
A square is a circle.
Charlotte!
Charlotte?
Steve! I'm in here!
Come on --- you give her the flowers.
~ Charlotte!
~ Steve, there's a big spider out there!
Take that off the wall right now!
I thought we had a deal. Go on!
Get that back in the basket!
Is it still there? It almost knocked the door down!
Don't worry, Darling! I'll take care of it.
Once and for all.
My-oteka --- sleep!
You want to learn? Here's lesson number one:
People in apartments, spiders outside.
My-oteka!
Mr. Marshall! Mr. Marshall!
~ But it's like a pet to him!
~ Then it's a stupid pet!
And I doubt if it was even house-trained!
I can't live like this. God, it must have laid eggs all over the place.
My Love, I promise you --- I'll personally call pest control!
It won't be enough. We have to move at once!
Be right back...
One of those hairy things --- you know, and its legs are so big!
What is it --- a yak?
~ Oh, it's you.
~ Thanks for leaving me with the Russians.
They pickled me in gallons of vodka. We shook on it.
We shook on it --- I can't feel my fingers!
Hey, hey --- give me my car keys back.
~ You sleep on your own. This is outright alienation.
~ What?
I'm staying with Master Dong. I won't take any more of this.
~ I threw the monster out the window, Baby!
~ You threw the boy out the window?
Wait --- for you!
Nope, here he is again, still alive and kicking, it seems.
Is hard to learn good.
One of those huge furry things, you know, with arms like a pair of knitting needles.
A sweater?
I know, Charlotte, I'm sure Master Dong has a very cosmic view...
but I'd rather talk it over with you. You see...
OK, take care. Bye
Mimi, knock it off, will you?
I showed you how to use a fork.
Why Charlotte leaving?
Don't get cute with me --- you know perfectly well why she left.
You just one woman?
Of course there's only just one woman in my life.
In village you see many females. You blind?
No, but...when you love a girl...
How can I explain?
It's like having a large picture in front of you.
It blocks the view, it hides the rest. The other women disappear.
Me see them anyway.
Hello? Hi, Richard.
My-oteka!
Thanks a lot, Pal. Well, if it's OK with Marie, it'll help out a lot.
My-oteka!
You sleep. I wake you Lipolipo.
Mimi?
Mimi, I can't watch you tomorrow.
So I've had an idea.
~ And now boys and girls...it's time...
~ Meet Jonathan and Sophie. Say hello.
He's like the TV!
Nobody has TV where Mimi comes from.
~ That's the pits!
~ Don't worry, Steve.
Everything will be just fine.
Ah, here's my little Tarzan.
You like them, huh? Well, I hope so, they cost me a fortune!
This one is a Fighting Peccaris --- it's from your country.
Hey, Steve...look!
He'll recognize me...he'll follow my finger, look!
Except when there are people around, anyway.
He must be shy. It's always the same with fish!
Baboon! Baboon! Same river as village of you.
Of course! It runs all the way up there.
And if you follow the stream, there's the Eiffel Tower.
But there --- great salt sea.
Ah, a regular Columbus, huh? Quick as a monkey!
I know --- let's get going.
~ Now I'll show you the garden, Mimi-Siku.
~ "Mimi-Siku"!
~ He's right --- stupidest name I ever heard.
Oh, yeah? Is Johnny Depp any better?
I can't stand her any more --- she's giving my therapist ulcers!
We have to find a boarding school for her.
~ Coming, Steve?
~ Yeah. Very well.
He prefers to sleep in his hammock. He'll hang it anywhere in the garden.
~ You're very brave.
~ Talk to him normally, Marie.
So can I trust you, Mimi?
Coming, Baboon?
Oh, sorry! --- Here.
As you can see, my Russian friends have kept their word.
OK, let me count it, all right?
What's going on? What did he say?
Mr. Koutchnoukov is very offended by your lack of trust...
and if you want to count, he'd rather cancel the whole deal.
Fine, that's not a problem. No countsky.
No, wait. I have to speak with my associate. Sorry.
Are you totally out of your mind? It's cash!
I'm not laundering the Russian Mafia's money. I'm not signing this.
There's no other way. The price is down to $100 --- we're losing a fortune!
We'll pay for it ourselves. We'll sell our company shares.
I'll borrow money. You remortgage your house.
~ Sounds great but I've got kids to feed.
~ So do I, remember?
Yeah, but my kids eat Sony, Reebok, and Nintendo...
not cocoanuts, bananas, and cat chow.
I'm serving fish sticks. I hope you like fish, Mimi-Siku.
That no fish. Bad on tongue.
But Mimi --- I've got to cook it first, Darling!
He's my Dad's partner's son. He's some pygmy --- he can't even talk.
He's got the dorkiest name, and the worst part is that we have to take him to the carnival.
Sophie! Jonathan! Will you come have lunch, kids!
Hey, Retardo, lunchtime!
Mom's freaking again --- got to go. Call you back!
~ Where's Mimi?
~ Go get him. I think he's outside.
Oh, So-So, how many times have I told you not to wear your Walkman at the table?
And how many times have I told you not to call me that?
My name is stupid enough, so don't overdo it!
Mommy, Mommy, I think Mimi did a bad thing!
What are you doing? Mimi, you can't light a fire in the garden.
It's dangerous. What are you eating?
What are you eating?
This fish stick. Much very good.
~ But where did you get that?
~ House fish box.
Mommy Mommy Mommy! He's barbequed Pop's fish!
My God! Richard'll have a heart attack!
Sophie, Sophie, get down here. He's eating Pop's fish!
Good for him! They're really sucky, all of them!
Oh, Mimi, that's not a very nice thing to do.
Jonathan and Sophie's father will be so sad.
He loves them all --- he loves them with a passion!
Oh, Mimi --- he's such an aquariophile.
You not to cry --- river full of fish!
Want some?
Baboon! Baboon! Baboon!
~ What a pain!
~ Told you! He's bizarre!
Baboon! Baboon!
Come on, Mogli, you're going to wait for us.
Come on, come on --- over here!
Man, you're going to love this ride. I got you a whole stack of tickets.
Me not know how --- you show me.
I don't believe it. You just sit in here.
It goes up and down. You're a real brain, aren't you?
Go sleep.
Him like ride. Me go with girl.
You not be afraid. Me fight for girl.
I'm not getting paid enough. Some guy just bit me!
I'm out of here!
$800,000 in cash? You schmucks, it stinks!
That's what I thought, of course.
I even wondered if the Russian Mafia was trying to launder some loot.
Who are these people?
An important Eastern European holding. They prefer to remain anonymous.
But don't worry, they seem sound enough!
Otherwise, someone like Steve wouldn't have signed with them, much less me.
And just where IS Marchado?
~ Marchado? ~ Marchado?
Well, he's here. He signed. He's here.
OK, empty your sternum and open your chakras as wide as you can.
Let's do one last EE-OM.
That's all for today.
And please don't forget --- cash next time, no checks.
Is bad Karma, Steve. I was all set for the 12th.
You completely destabilized Charlotte.
Six of her chakras have closed up...
Give me a break, you crook. Get lost or I'll close up all of your chakras.
And get a neck.
~ Hello, beautiful.
~ Hi, Steve. Finally, just the two of us!
~ Are you hungry?
~ Yes --- where?
I've had a little idea.
~ How about this?
~ It looks fabulous!
It's a spatial, temporal kind of thing.
Your son is very cute but he's 2,000 years behind his civilization line.
The East is silent and the West is eloquent,...
but your small caveman comes from the West so there has to be some turbulence.
Wouldn't he be happier in his village with all his friends?
Steering Garden or Chair Wheel?
Charlotte, this is tough on me, too.
In a few days, I'll get the papers for the divorce --- your chakras are reopening...
Mimi-Siku is at Richard's...everything's fine.
You're so right. Oh, how forgetful I am. We'll have an exquisite evening.
No sleep too?
Dad's right --- you do climb like a monkey.
If you think civilized women are impressed by that...
Woman?
Well...I mean...I'm not impressed at all...
~ Boy, you'll never get me.
~ You think me hunting for you?
Me was showing you hunting for me.
Richard...we're home.
Why do you have to drink so much?
I'll get you an Alka-Seltzer.
Marie, there's a problem here.
I thought I warned you about overfeeding the fish.
You're going on a diet tomorrow.
Sophie!
Richard! Richard!
Look, calm down, Marie!
I can't understand a word.
No, I don't believe it. Right, give me a minute.
I'm coming, I'm coming!
Where are we here? Driver! Drop me off here on the bank!
I'm sorry, Darling. I won't be long --- enjoy the Dervish!
I'll be right back.
Oh, Steve, I caught them in the hammock. God knows what he did to her.
Don't overreact, Marie. So they were making out!
He may not have messed with Sophie, but he sure screwed up my aquarium.
But Steve, what if she's pregnant?
~ You'll be a grandmother.
~ You've lost your mind!
Relax, Marie. Nobody ever got pregnant from getting kissed!
I did!
I can't take you anywhere. You can't go around climbing into hammocks...
~ with 12-year-old girls.
~ She asked to me.
Come on. Are you sure she did?
Asked me with eyes, you know.
Well. Let's get going.
Get in. Put your stuff in the back.
He's forgetting something. Here.
~ Mimi --- not in the car!
~ Fresh fish --- much very good.
Well, you can't see Sophie again. Her parents won't let you.
Don't be sad.
When you get back to Lipolipo, you'll have a lot of girls.
But now me like you are.
Love only one female.
Great big picture in view, me no see others.
I'm sorry, Mimi --- but you'll have to forget her.
When Paliku away, you forget?
No.
No, at first the image stays in front of you.
It fades away after a while.
And one morning you wake up, and you see new life.
You find that small image on the horizon.
It's still as beautiful --- but now it's a memory.
The one day, a new image shows up, and a new love fills up your view.
Her picture still there.
Shit!
~ Oh, Charlotte, shit! I got stuck, sorry!
~ I noticed. I've been waiting for two hours...
drifting with that dancing freak.
I realize that your son has to come first, but my love,...
I'm so stressed out that I won't be coming home.
~ But, Charlotte, if I...
~ I'm not coming home!
~ I'm going to Dong's for balance and Karma enhancement.
~ You're breaking up...
Charlotte, I can't hear you anymore.
You forget.
She's going to boarding school,
she's going to boarding school!
Drop dead, you geek!
Look, Sophie, it's for your own good. Your uncle Billy's coming for you tomorrow.
~ Well, I won't go to your stinking place!
~ Don't be impolite.
Besides, you might like it ---  besides, all your cousins are there.
They're all a bunch of basket-cases.
Careful, Sophie, you're asking for it.
She's right about your family --- they're nuts.
Mom's family's nuts, Mom's family's...
Steve! We have to talk. No, no...this is awful!
Relax, Richard, they're just being kids!
All right, all right, I'm coming.
You told me at morning, picture very far.
But Sophie still here.
Well, I'll sort it out with her Dad, OK?
I'll be back in an hour.
How much time an hour?
An hour means, well...
There --- see the Eiffel Tower?
When the sun's right behind it, that's an hour.
Steve!
Steve!
What's wrong? What's so awful?
Why awful? Who said awful? It's not awful!
The Russians are buying us lunch, that's all.
~ Huh?
~ Steve, the Russians!
Come on, the deal is dead and buried.
I'm busy. I thought you got me out here to talk about Sophie.
We'll talk about that later, Pal. It's time to talk about food.
After that kind of deal, you could at least have lunch with the clients.
~ Don't tell me that you sold!
~ But thank God we sold!
Soy beans crashed, the option's worth nothing, zero, zilch!
What do you mean, "thank God we sold"?
~ I never signed a thing!
~ I signed, we signed, they paid --- it's cold, a deal!
~ You mean you forged my signature?
~ I didn't forge it, I signed for me, for you,...
for your wife, for my family, for my house.
The ship was going down and someone had to bail us out.
If you're going to panic, I don't know if we can keep working together.
Not only are we through working together...
I'm also going to sue your butt. Kiss your house goodbye, you idiot!
But you could at least have lunch!
~ No way, I'm out of here.
~ Desert? Coffee, maybe?
Please, Steve, they love you. You must come. They insisted!
A problem, Mr. Montillac?
No! None!
Have mercy, Steve! Please don't leave me.
One morning, Mr. Koutchnoukov decided to buy a friend's handsome pig.
And that very dear friend promised him he was making a very juicy deal.
That same evening, that pig was sick in bed suffering from hay fever.
Mr. Koutchnoukov demanded his money back, but his dear friend refused.
Mr. Koutchnoukov reluctantly had to cut off all of his left hand's fingers.
And the very dear friend paid back with the right hand.
Hilarious.
Mr. Koutchnoukov has a very disagreeable certainty that you have both acted as his friend did.
~ Oh, no! Not at all. It's totally different!
~ You liar!
You, too.
~ By screwing on us.
~ Aha --- so you speak French, Mr. Koutchnoukov.
Unfortunately, he's also able to read, Mr. Marchado.
And now give back all money, and then take back all of your rotten product!
If no, I cut off fingers!
Wait a minute, this is barbaric! Don't forget we're in France here!
And don't forget we have laws. And once we sign papers, we have contracts.
~ You can't just break them when you want to.
~ Yeah, he's right...
~ when it's signed, it's signed.
~ So piss off.
You should not believe that my good friends won't keep their promise.
Even though I'm just your contact, they have just sliced off...
a small percentage they have served as today's hot special.
So, my friends --- return all cash today!
Or else --- finger sandwich! No cash, pinky goulash! Do you see what I mean?
~ Sophie?
~ Mimi!
Sophie, you're not supposed to phone, so please hang up right now!
Mimi, Mimi, they're sending me to boarding...!
Sophie?
I hate you all. I wish you were dead.
Sophie!
Sophie!
~ Oh, yes, I swear it. He sleeps on his balcony.
~ Mr. Marchado?
Yes yes yes...oh my God, dear me.
It's kind of like a fishing net. Of course it's not that big.
~ I don't know, sorry.
~ But it's got strings to hold it.
~ Oh, a laundry bag?
~ No no no, not a laundry bag!
One of those things --- some Indians use them to sleep in!
Oh, our friends the Indians!
There --- an Indian!
Oh my God! --- What is he doing here? --- Wait a minute!
Come back here! How did you get in here. And where are you from?
Lipolipo! Go sleep!
Help us! Help us! The Indians are attacking...!
Stop hitting me! Somebody had to find a way out of this mess!
I hope you have a damn good reason to sell your company stock.
I hate to take your shares, but if it's for a good cause...
Richard's got a hot tip on a chain of Russian finger-food restaurants.
Phone's still busy. I'm going back home.
~ I'm getting worried about Mimi.
~ No no no. Please, Steve, we've got to get back.
If the Russians call home and we're not there, it's going to be bad bad bad.
Will you please stop the backtalk!
Oh, Richard, help me. She's driving me nuts.
~ I can't handle her anymore.
~ Not now, please, we're in deep shit!
We've got some guys asking for their money back.
We may even have to sell everything you own!
Serves you right --- your money stinks!
~ You get upstairs before I smack you!
~ Go ahead, slap me.
I'll call the child abuse hotline and have you arrested!
~ Shut up, I can't hear the TV.
~ Oh, yeah? Can you hear me better now?
Oh, Richard, that's not fair. What has he done?
What have I done, huh? What have I done?
Richard, I'm sorry but the line's still busy! I've got to go check!
No no no, please don't leave me. We're in this together!
You got to stay with me until we pay them off, I beg you.
Come on, Steve --- hang up or they won't be able to get through!
Sophie, your dinner's ready.
I can't believe it --- I can't even reach the janitor!
You really should eat something!
Very smart! They're going to make appetizers out of us and you ask if I want food!
I'm going out. I'll be right back. If they call, reach me in my car!
Come on, Steve, don't...
Oh, come on, Sophie!
What's he up to? What's he up to? Shit?
We don't have a clue --- I knew something weird was going on!
First that poor pigeon gets nailed to the wall, then I get attacked by that...sweater!
And then it flew straight at me...it went WHOOSH...
Mimi?
One of those things you blow into --- a big straw that shoots toothpicks.
Yes, I hear "Go sleep", that I remember...then everything blacked out!
~ Yes, Mr. Marchado?
~ No, nothing --- thanks.
My parents sent me there for two years and I made a loads of friends.
Well, good for you! But I'm not going.
~ What are you doing?
~ Indians make me ralph.
Oh, Richard, please talk to Sophie because she refuses to listen to me!
~ Later, later!
~ Later? Later when? When you're completely drunk?
When you can't even stand up straight?
I'm going, all right! I'm going!
Why do I have to do everything around here?
Mimi!
Me walk very long --- follow my heart on the river.
Hello? Hello? Yes, speaking. Of course we have all the money.
My friends wish for a quiet and very discrete meeting with you...
in the train station's public restroom.
Sure. Of course. We'll be there in half an hour, no problem.
Without police.
Mr. Koutchnoukov would be extremely annoyed if one of you intended to speak with police.
Of course no police. What police?
Keep your voice down --- you'll wake Jonathan.
I've had it with that little twerp's father. What a mess, what a mess.
Don't worry, give me five minutes.
Listen, Mimi's disappeared. The phone was off the hook.
Did Sophie phone him tonight?
I don't know and I don't care, OK! Move your butt!
Sophie?
Sophie, open this door!
Richard! Your daughter locked herself in her room and won't open the door.
Richard, come on! She won't talk to me!
OK, I'm coming!
~ She locked herself in.
~ Oh, yeah?
We'll see about that!
Sophie! Stop him, he's kidnapping her!
Sophie has a boyfriend, Sophie has a boyfriend!
~ And he took the briefcase!
~ He took the briefcase!
~ Take that big mouth of yours...
~ Richard, I can't stand it anymore.
What have I done? What have I done? Nothing! Nothing!
Steve! We're in trouble!
Your kid left with Sophie and he stole the briefcase!
Where did they go?
Sophie! Darling!
~ Sophie!
~ Mimi! Stop! Come back! Wait!
~ Sophie!
~ Mimi! Mimi! Come back!
~ Sophie, come back!
~ Forget it, they can't hear us anymore.
Come on!
~ We'll never catch up to them in that thing!
~ We'll make it.
There's no gas left in their Zodiac.
~ Row faster, you lazy bum.
~ I can't, my hands are freezing.
Good --- you won't fell a thing when they cut your fingers off!
They're starting to warm up...
~ Broken?
~ No --- I think we're out of gas!
We two spend night --- over there.
And moving when sun comes up.
Here --- I found these to light the fire.
No good them.
Better this.
You Indian girl now. Can choose your name.
Can you choose for me?
~ Uku-me.
~ Uku-what?
Uku-me --- means many drops of rain on wide river.
That's pretty.
~ All of this is that little ape's fault!
~ Whose fault?
It's all your fault --- and stop calling my son an ape, or you're going for a swim.
~ I'm sorry, Steve.
~ And it certainly wasn't his idea to steal the briefcase...
He doesn't even know what money is.
He's a crafty little ape and a fast learner!
~ I thought I told you to knock it off.
~ I bruise easily, you maniac!
Look --- over there! The Zodiac!
~ Mimi!
~ Sophie!
Fathers --- look for us!
~ Kids! Mimi!
~ Sophie!
They're not looking for us. They just want their filthy money.
Sophie, Mimi. Are you there?
Look!
Mimi! Mimi, Sophie!
Hey, guys, come back!
~ Mimi?
~ Sophie!
Sophie, come back or you're ripe for a good spanking.
Will you shut up? Why the hell should she come back?
You're always slapping her. That's why she ran away.
Do you see what kind of a father you are?
Don't you see that you piss her off?
You piss your wife off, you piss your kids off, you piss me off...
dressing like me all the time.
For twenty years I've been covering for your screwups...you piss everybody off!
Well, yeah, sure...you have to cover up for me because I'm a jerk.
I never could dress properly so I dressed like you, because I'm a jerk.
And I slap my kids because I'm a jerk.
Kids, come back!
Are you happy? They won't come back now.
Of course they won't come back. You're always right.
Yeah, I am.
Well, for once you're wrong. You have no idea what it takes to be a father, Pal.
You just started playing Dad and you're giving me a lecture?
But I've been waking up with my children every day for twelve years...
and there's not one minute that I don't worry.
And now, we're going to act like all dumb dads whose kids run away.
We're going to call the police, hoping they find them before they get hurt.
Then we'll pay back the finger eaters, all right?
And as for the kid...send him back to his mother.
He's not happy here. OK?
I guess we'll start from scratch with our rotten soybeans.
Hold on. You're saying I've got nothing left --- is that it?
Not quite --- you've got me.
Marie, Marie, I couldn't find the kids. I'm calling the police.
What police?
Richard!
Here's the money! All the money!
Excellent. Mr. Koutchnoukov was just about to get a taste of your son's fingers.
I'd advise you not to do that.
Somebody touches one of my children and I'll liable to blow!
Steve!
If you don't trust us, I'd prefer to cancel the whole deal!
Mr. Montillac, I would be very glad to slap you myself...
Your delay unfortunately cost me three more knuckles.
Your soy beans.
Mr. Montillac, if you have other opportunities like this, please refrain from calling my office.
~ Where's my little girl?
~ I'll call the police.
Hey, hey, stop it, mister, you're starting to piss me off.
Shut up, Shorty, you're lucky we don't lock you up...
for being negligent. Letting kids run around naked in the streets!
You're damned lucky...
They're in here --- go on in.
Believe me, she's got it coming!
~ Baboon!
~ Come on, Mimi, we're leaving!
Come on, Sweetheart, everything's fine.
How about that? Sure, everything's fine. Like we've got nothing better to do...
than look for your brats.
Baboon --- me want return Lipolipo, village of me.
Yeah, ship him back. That's where he should be.
We got enough fruitcakes as it is.
Up oars!
Careful --- you better keep him in line or I'm breaking his neck.
Up oars!
~ Daddy's a tough guy...
~ Get your hands off of me, you psycho...
Go sleep!
How does he do that?
What have you done to him?
Push in neck.
What the hell did you do to my partner?
The boy --- he did an Indian thing with his thumb.
Like this.
Do you want to lose your thumb?
But it's an Indian trick that doesn't seem to work at all.
When push in neck no work, Indian do this!
Come on, Baboon!
Here --- when you too can kill fly, you real Indian.
I'll practice a lot. We'll hunt together some day.
~ You never to come Lipolipo.
~ I will!
As soon as I can, some day.
Come soon? Me no believe that.
You obligation to work always. Sophie also obligation.
Mimi, don't be sad, you'll get a letter from Sophie.
~ Me no able read.
~ Why not ask Paliku to teach you?
Me never cry. Me a man.
Here --- open it on the plane.
Go on, they won't wait for you.
Steve, Darling!
The divorce papers have arrived from Venezuela.
And Master Dong worked it all out --- we can be married on the 14th.
I'm overwhelmed.
Steve, we just went through a kuana --- a potentially depressive one.
But it's a trial we had to confront.
~ And Master Dong...
~ Is he here?
Yes, in the kitchen.
Steve, you've got to come into this all the way through.
You also have problems with chakras.
He's going to move in for a while with us...
sort of a ménage à trois. He'll help us get harmonized again.
Steven --- he'll explain better than I can. I'll get him.
Master Dong?
Steven!
You've got to see this!
Just look at the price --- it's blasting off! For soy beans!
Incredible, guys! Just incredible!
It's great work!
I've got to admit it --- I'm impressed.
I thought you guys had blown it, but this time you fooled me.
How could you possibly know about the embargo?
Don't tell him --- we're pros!
Sir, excuse me...your next appointment has arrived.
Bye, Montillac. Marchado, you stay here.
My friend, you've had this coming.
I've decided to name you our new director in Stockholm.
But do me one favor --- please take Montillac with you...
because I don't want to see that dwarf again.
I hope you don't mind --- you'll have to work with Miss van Hodden.
Miss van Hodden, Mr. Marchado.
~ Enchanted.
~ Very pleased to meet you.
Is there a problem, Marchado?
No, of course not!
Stockholm is a very nice place. The summer lasts a bit more than a week...
but it's very warm. All through winter it's dark all day...
but you'll get used to it. In fact, it's very cozy!
~ Will we have trouble adapting?
~ It's all the same as long as we're with Steve.
~ Mom, Pop, when are we taking off?
~ You should be glad this isn't taking off.
What did I say?
What's he doing?
The plane for Stockholm is ready for immediate boarding.
~ I've tried to get you seated together.
~ Thanks.
Where the hell is Steve? He's never where he's supposed to be.
He's got all our boarding passes.
I got it, Richard. Take a look. I got it!
See?
"The palace belonged to a rabbit.
"The bold beaver came home and said...
"'Who has made...?'"
Baboon?
Mimi? I did it. I got it!
The fly --- I nailed it!
~ Stop --- liar!
~ You don't believe me?
~ Want me to show you?
~ When? Later?
No...right now!
Baboon?
Look!
You Indian now! You live Lipolipo?
I'll be staying with you for a while. Will you teach me to hunt?
Here --- it's a gift for you.
Sophie OK?
Oh, yeah!
Yeah, I think so.
Do you really have to wear that thing?
~ Uku-me!
~ Mimi!
Oh, no, what a mess! What a mess! What a mess!
Steve?
~ What a mess, what a mess...what a mess!
