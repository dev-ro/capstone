Detective Knox
approached the cemetery
like he had done
so many times before.
But this crime scene
would soon prove to be
very different.
Because the dead body...
was none other than
Detective Knox himself.
I'm a ghost.
Gunner!
Hey.
Where, oh, where could
my dear, sweet son be?
Hmm.
Could've sworn he was in here.
Hm.
Really need to talk to him.
Did you think you got me?
- No, I didn't think...
- It feels like you think
- you got me.
- No, I didn't!

- Hi.
- Perfect timing.
Hi, Gunner.
Okay, share with your dad.
Do you want to share?
You should be
taking it easy, babe.
No, I feel good.
I feel better today.
Mm. You look better.
Thank you.
I have never seen
anything like it.
A Chinese restaurant that
only plays top 100 country hits.
My favorite.
- Don't even joke about that.
- What?
Country music is a line
in the sand of this marriage.
- Aah!
- I'm serious.
This town is weird.
Think that's why we got
such a good deal on a house.
That, and this whole
antler lighting situation.
Stop it.
It's just... different here
than what we're used to.
Yeah, real different.
Right?
Gunner.
No books at the table, though.
- Gunner.
- Yeah?
No books at the table, bud.
Gunner's been
getting to know the town.
He's been all over on his
scooter, he made a friend.
Mrs. Bakemeyer,
at the bookstore.
Did you go by there again today?
Yeah.
And I went to a funeral.
A funeral?
Yeah.
Whose funeral?
You shouldn't be going to
a stranger's funeral, Gunner.
That's private.
Why would you do that?
It was just for research.
You made him feel weird.
It is weird.
He knows you're sick,
and he's researching funerals?
It's for his
graphic novel.
Who did this to me?
Gunner?
Can I come in?
Okay.
I know this move's been
hard for you.
It's been hard
for your dad, too.
He's just always mad at me.
I really preferred it
when he was gone.
Don't say that, Gunner.
I'm sorry, Mom, but it's true.
He loves you so much.
And since he's been
back from Japan,
he's just stressed about me.
Where do we go when we die?
Oh, that's easy.
The Cheesecake Factory.
Mom.
Okay, real talk.
No one knows for sure.
But I believe there's
a special place our souls go.
A place we won't understand
until we're already there.
You know?
Like heaven?
Yeah.
Does everyone go there?
I don't know.
The one thing we do know
is that we have this time now
and we have to spend it
loving each other every day.
Come here.

Hey, Gunner.
Get up, let's go toss the ball
around before I head to work.
What time is it?
8:30.
Dad, it's summer vacation.
Sun's been up for hours.
Come on, come on.
Show your old man what you got.
Oh, no.
Dad! You ruined them!
Mom? Mom!
I'm just nauseous.
Dad!
Mom's sick again.
You stay out here.
- No, don't.
- It's okay. It's me.
Hi, Mrs. Bakemeyer.
Hi, Gunner.
I read to Chapter 12 last night.
Holmes and Watson had just
entered the abandoned building.
Where'd you leave off?
You finished these already?
Can I borrow
some different books?
I promise I'll keep them
in good condition.
What about your research
for Detective Knox?
I'm doing new research.
I'm gonna need every book
you have on leukemia.

Hi. Um... the medicine
you're giving my mom,
I don't really think
that it's the right one.
Well, it's medicine
to take all her pain away.
I know, but I think that
you should give her
methotrexate or...
doxorubicin hydrochloride...
I'm sorry.
It's really not my call.

You better not have
come empty-handed.
You know the deal.
I always thought the Water Man
was just a bunch of B.S.,
something grown-ups told kids
to keep them from
sneaking off into the woods.
But then I met him face-to-face.
And I have the scar to prove it.
Some of what you've heard
is true,
like how he lives
out in the woods
by a lake called Wild Horse,
that the forest has turned weird
because of his powers,
that he's gone crazy.
But no one knows
where to find him.
No one except me.
If you want to hear the rest
of the story, you got to pay.
Damn it.
Something's burning.
Thank you.
...September,
and it's fire season,
the earliest in nearly
four decades.
The overall 923 wildfires
were reported
across the state of Oregon,
burning approximately
60,000 acres
as climate change brings
more extreme weather
across the globe.
Here in the Pacific Northwest,
the 2018 National
Climate Assessment...
The Water Man.
"Bussey & Sons."
You're trying to sell me
something, the answer's no.
It's about
the Water Man.
Is this yours?
I got rid of that years ago.
There's a note in here.
It's about the Water Man.
Is this a prank?
Where are your friends, huh?
Where are they hiding?
Where're your buddies
with the cameras?
Um, Mister... Bussey, right?
Yeah, I warned you kids.
You pulled another prank,
I'd call the police.
It's not a prank.
I just want to know
if the Water Man is real.
- Of course he's real.
- I just moved here
and I wanted to hear
from someone
who actually knew
what they were talking about.
Really thought that
you could help me.
- What's your name?
- Gunner Boone.
Gunner Boone, you swear
this isn't a prank?
I cross my heart.
In here.
You cold?
- No.
- You sure?
It's always freezing
in this darn house.
Yeah, take a seat.
So, why do you care so much
about the Water Man?
The note I saw in this book
says that he's immortal.
I need to know more about it.
Mm. Yeah, well, death is a
strange thing, Gunner Boone.
One instant you're alive,
rejuvenating cells,
forming memories, interacting
with the world around you.
And then in the blink of an eye,
your heart stops beating.
Your organs, your blood...
it all ceases, begins to decay.
Cookie?
Now, in my line of work,
you spend a lot of time
with the dead.
I know everyone who's died
in the whole county.
Yep, death is pretty much a
cut-and-dried business, Gunner.
It's permanent.
Except when it comes...
to the Water Man.
His real name was Edward Schaal.
He was a young man when he and
his wife moved to Wild Horse.
Wild Horse started out
as a mining town.
But the only rock
in those mountains
were igneous rock... obsidian,
worth less than iron.
One day, Edward found
a rock vein
no one had ever seen before.
Its glow was mesmerizing.
But his discovery
was soon forgotten,
because that very night, tragedy
struck the town of Wild Horse.
The Wild Horse Dam broke.
The flood came suddenly.
No warning.
No chance to escape.
He and his wife, Sarah,
were swallowed up.
Some of the bodies floated
downstream as far as Pine Mills.
My father was just a boy then,
about your age.
He saw the carnage...
saw it himself.
And his father, my grandfather,
he had to examine the bodies.
And he declared them all
deceased.
That was, until...
Edward Schaal
miraculously woke up.
From that day on,
he was known as the Water Man.
And even though Wild Horse
had been washed away,
he moved back there,
claimed he could save his wife,
if only he could find her body.
He hung black stones
all around the forest
to mark where he'd searched.
Most people thought
he was crazy.
Except for a few,
my father included,
who swore they saw something
in those woods...
dead animals
coming back to life.
They said it was proof that
the Water Man's power is real.
Legend has it that he's still
living up by the lake,
searching the waters
and the woods
for his wife's body
so he could bring her
back from the dead,
even if all that was left of her
were her bones.
Sarah!
How did he get his power?
Some say blood magic.
But my father swore
it had something to do
with that rock vein
the Water Man found
deep in the belly of the mine.
Rock that was of no value
to the living,
but invaluable to their dead.
When my father passed away,
God rest his soul,
I tried to go up there
to the lake,
find the stone,
see if it was true.
But that forest is alive,
and I got spooked
being in those woods all alone.
I believed if I found him,
I'd get to see my father again.
But no one knows
where to find him.
No one except me.
Do you have a copy of this
that I could borrow?
That is a copy.
Keep it. It's yours.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Mom!
Mom?
Baby! Oh! Amos!
-What is it?
Gunner, what happened?
Gunner, what happened?
He saw me without my...
I think I just scared him.
Hey, stop. Stop.
You're upsetting your mom.
Damn it.
I said stop!
Amos!
You're okay.
I'm sorry.
You're okay.
Is that a sword?
Uh...
Yes.
Where'd you get it?
I have a question
about the Water Man.
Got any money?
Yes.
What's your name?
Gunner.
Hi, Gunner.
I'm Jo.
Follow me.
So, do you... do you live here?
For now.
Till I save up enough money
to get my own place.
I've got a few stories
that cost more than a dollar,
but I'm telling you...
- They're worth it.
- Okay.
But I'm still gonna need money
to buy supplies.
Supplies for what?
I'm going to find
the Water Man.
Come into my office.
Ever been alone
in those woods, kid?
No.
Let's say you survive the words,
make it all the way past
the river, cliffs, the coyotes.
You'll find yourself
face-to-face
with the devil himself.
Not many of us around
to tell that side of the story.
Wanna know more?
Tell me everything you know
about the Water Man.
I can do you one better.
Give me all your money,
and I'll take you to him myself.
But what about supplies?
Okay, sure, we'll buy supplies.
Then give me what's left over.
But I should warn you,
those woods will scare
the crap out of you, dude.
I keep the money
even if you back out.
Do we have a deal?
I made a list of everything
that we need.
Well, actually,
it's everything that I need,
'cause I didn't know
that you were gonna come.
What the hell?
Only need half this stuff.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Jo!
What?
If you snitch, I kill you.
Come on.
Uh, hello? We're ready.
This is a lot of peaches.
We've got moola.
Is that a weapon?
Oh, um...
You kids are up early
on summer vacation.
Do your parents know
you're here?
Listen, dude.
Why don't you just,
like, mind your own business?
How about
I call the police
and make it their business?
It's an antique samurai sword.
My dad brought it back
from Japan.
He was stationed there
in the Navy.
I just like to carry it around.
And we're gonna need
all this food
'cause we're having a picnic.
Sir.
I'm here to report
a missing child,
My son, he's missing.
Okay, yeah,
um, we can do that.
We just need to file a report.
Excuse me, sir, how long
has your son been missing?
I don't... I don't know.
Uh, please, have a seat.
What is your name, sir?
Amos Boone.
And your son's name, Mr. Boone?
Gunner.
Gunner. Any reason
you think he might run away?
His mom is real sick,
and, uh, it's been hard on him.
On all of us.
Um... I raised my voice
at him last night.
Uh...
He left... He left this note.
"I know how to make you better."
Do you know
what he meant by that?
No, I don't.
I'm hungry.
My stomach hurts.
Um...
You didn't happen to bring a can
opener or anything, did you?
Jo, if you damage that sword,
my dad is going to kill me.
Stop being such a wuss.
I'm serious, Jo.
Ew! Gross!
Shut up.
It's not funny!
Gunner?
Hey, babe. You okay?
Just tired.
Where's Gunner?
Oh, he's playing out... side.
I think you really
scared him last night.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm not the one
you need to say it to.
I'll be...
just, you know... right...
Hey!
You seen a kid riding around
on an electric scooter?
His name's Gunner Boone.
- No. Why?
- He's my son.
He hasn't come home.
- Maybe the Water Man got him.
- Shut up, idiot.
Who's the Water Man?
Just some stupid
ghost story!
So, your dad just let you
take his old samurai sword?
Uh...
You ran away.
Did not.
I left a note.
You left a note.
Dude, your runaway skills suck.
Does he hit you?
No.
Then what?
I'm never good enough for him.
He's probably happy
I'm gone, anyway.
Just...
less stuff on his plate.
What about your parents?
Are they gonna come after you?
I don't need anyone
looking out for me.
I can take care of myself.
- Is that a coyote?
- Could be.
Or the howling wild horses.
They usually travel in packs.
The howling wild horses?
We should take turns
keeping watch.
You see anything move,
don't think...
swing that sword.
You take first watch.
Thanks.
Hey.
Will you... Will you hold me
for a bit?
Yeah. Of course.
Mmm.
Been so out of it today,
I didn't even see Gunner.
Mm, I should go talk to him.
No, you should rest, babe.
Um, he's asleep.
He's been out all day again.
Something's on your mind.
What is it?
Just seems like he doesn't want
to be around me.
I promise you,
he needs you right now.
You just need to see him.
Really see him.
Hello?
Mr. Water Man?
So, he's, um, been missing
for two days.
This gentleman's son here.
If you see anything at all...
Let me know if I can help you
find anything.
I'm Amos.
I think you know my son, Gunner.
I've never met a child so smart.
What an imagination.
I've been helping him with
his research for Detective Knox.
He didn't come home last night.
Did he come in today
or yesterday?
No. No, he didn't.
You have a pen and... and paper?
Uh, sure.
Uh, here are both my numbers,
home and cell.
Please let me know
if you hear from him.
I absolutely will.
And, uh, you mind
hanging these up?
Of course.
Thank you.
Want some candy?
No.
What was that look for?
Nothing.
Look, dude.
If you got a problem with me...
say it.
Stealing's wrong.
Ah, come on.
You've never stolen
anything in your life?
Never.
Never ever?
Never.
Wow.
Your mommy must be
so proud of you.
Don't talk about my mom.
I won't.
If you try one of these
delicious pieces
of stolen candy.
Stop it!
Make me!
Mommy's not here to save you.
Get off of me!
Do you hear that?
Is it the Water Man?
Run!
- Hey, Jake.
- Chuck.
Could you, uh, do us
a favor and hang one of these
- by the register, please?
- Yeah, sure. Sure thing.
Thank you.
Were you in the Navy?
Yeah.
How'd you know?
It was a day ago,
early morning.
His son and another kid...
a girl.
And your son, he had your sword.
Can you describe the girl?
Yeah. Crazy hair, blue.
She had a big scar
down her neck.
Looked kind of fresh.
Are you serious?
Not even one bar.
Maybe we should go back.
Retrace our steps.
Let me see your phone.
There's no service.
If we go northwest,
we'll eventually find the river
that will lead us to Wild Horse.
Look.
Jo, look. Snow.
No way.
It's July.
Never snows in July.
Whoa.
So cool!
It's a sign, right?
A sign we're getting close.
Maybe.
I don't know.
We should set up camp soon.
Gunner!
Gunner?
Hello?
Hi, Mrs. Bakemeyer. How are you?
Not yet. Did he come
by the bookstore again today?
W-Wait, I'm sorry.
What did my husband say?
A natural fort.
How'd you know to go northwest?
My dad taught me
how to read a map.
Mm.
That must've really hurt.
It did.
Time to get the firewood.
You take classes or something?
No, I just draw.
A lot.
Not ad.
Pretty dope, actually.
It's like a comic book
or something?
No, it's a graphic novel
about a detective
who's investigating
his own murder.
Cool.
So, how does it end?
I don't know yet.
You don't know?
It's your story.
How do you not know the ending?
You can't know the ending
until you get there.
What? What?! What?!
Get it out! What is it?!
What is it?!
Ew!
You... You were so scared.
It's not funny, dude!
Yes, it is, dude.
What are you doing?
My side. Don't cross it.
You take yourself too seriously.
Don't cross the line!
Fine.
Mary?
Got your message.
I spoke with the sheriff.
And she told me everything.
He sent me a text.
What? Gunner did?
When?
W-What did he say?
He sent it last night.
My phone was off.
It was from some strange number.
W-What did it say?
"I'm fine, Mom."
"I'm doing this for you."
I've been trying to get through
to that number for hours.
It just goes to
a generic voicemail.
You lied to me.
But I lied to Gunner.
I didn't think
he could handle the truth.
And you thought the same of me.
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I didn't want you
to get more sick.
I don't care what it takes,
we're gonna find him, okay?
Okay.
I'm gonna try again.
Ew!
Ugh!
Ugh! Aah!
Ugh! That was disgusting!
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!
- My backpack.
- I'm not going back there.
You okay?
Find anything?
Only mushrooms.
But they might be poisonous.
There's some weird stuff
going on.
It's a sign.
That we're getting close.
Don't you think?
We lost all our stuff.
I'm starving.
If we don't find him
by tonight, we'll go home.
I promise.
Okay.
- Hello?
- Hey, Amos.
Uh, Sheriff Goodwin here.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Uh, you get my message
about Gunner's text?
Uh, yes, I-I did, and we are
looking into that number.
Um, I just want to let you know,
I-I think I found, um,
Gunner's electric scooter
in an old mill
next to the forest.
Amos, listen.
There's a wildfire
growing in that forest.
Oh, my God. Uh...
Is it near where you found
th-the... the scooter?
I-I don't have
that information yet,
but I have escaping animals
and about 30 homes that I need
to help evacuate.
I should already be
on my way, so...
Okay, what... what about Gunner?
W-What if he's out there?
Okay, no,
you need to help us.
What about our son?
I-I really need to help
with these evacuations,
but I'm gonna have
my deputies step in.
Okay, so get me one of these
other deputies
to talk or something.
I promise you,
we are doing everything
- that we possibly can.
- Okay. Yeah, no.
- Let me talk to her. Let me...
- Baby. Baby. Okay.
Th-Thank you, Sheriff.
Thank you.
Yeah.
The Wild Horse forest fire
is growing by the second
after strong winds
blew embers from an electrical
fire toward Pine Mills
and the surrounding towns.
Residents in the area should
check with their local
fire or police...
- Where are you going?
- If he's in that forest,
- I'm gonna find him.
- What? How?
I've got to try.
...now under threat from this
spreading wildfire.
- Amos...
- I gotta try, babe.
...and bring you the latest
information as it unfolds.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Are you Gunner's father?
- I've seen posters around town.
- You have any info?
Yeah, I-I think I know
where he went.
Where?
Wild Horse.
What's in Wild Horse?
It's where the Water Man lives.
By the lake.
What, the ghost story?
Why would my son care
about that?
It's not a ghost story.
Your son seemed very interested
in how the Water Man
cheated death.
I'm sorry, I-I shouldn't
have given him the map.
I appreciate your help.
Got to go find my son.
Yeah. Uh, there's a waterfall,
Horsetail Falls.
If you can make it up the ridge,
maybe you can cut into the lake.
Thank you.
Air quality
warnings have been issued
due to the falling ash
covering much of the city.
More and more people
in the surrounding counties
are encouraged to pack
essentials and valuables...
Unh-unh. No way.
I'm not crossing that.
Well, I am.
- Uh!
- Dude!
Are you serious?!
See? Not so bad.
Gunner! Holy crap!
Jo, I can't swim!
Hold on, I'm coming!
I can't swim!
- Jo, help!
- Hold on!
I can't swim!
- Gunner! Gunner!
- Please, I can't hold on!
Don't let go!
Jo, help me!
Give me your hand.
Come on, Gunner, we can do it.
We can do it. We can do it.
Come on, come on!
Give me your leg.
Thank you.
Let's keep going.
We're halfway across.
Excuse me, excuse me, folks.
Coming through. Pardon.
Sheriff. You know the girl
with the scar you asked about?
- You found something?
- Yeah.
And the text message
came from her phone.
Where exactly did you see
the Water Man?
In the woods.
Yeah, but where exactly?
I'm tired.
Yeah, coming. One sec.
George Riley?
- Sheriff Goodwin.
- Yeah, what's this about?
Want to ask a few questions
about your daughter, Josephine.
What'd she do now?
Have you ever seen your daughter
hanging out with this boy?
I never seen that boy
in my life.
It's not the kind of friends
Jo would have, anyway.
He went missing two days ago.
The boy's mother got a text
from Jo's phone,
and we have a witness
that saw him and a girl
with a scar on her neck
together before he disappeared.
Well, like I said,
I never seen that kid, so...
Josephine here?
Love to talk to her.
Oh, uh, well,
she's out and about.
Where does she usually go?
I don't know, around town.
Usual spots kids go.
When's the last time
you saw her?
Yesterday, maybe.
It's summer
vacation, you know?
I pulled some records
from the county hospital.
Josephine got 15 stitches
on a cut on her neck last month.
How'd she get that cut?
Know what, I have no idea
how that happened.
Jo's just that type of kid.
She's always getting herself
into trouble, you know?
Maybe we should go back
to where you saw him.
I don't want to talk about this
right now, okay?
I know, but it'll...
it'll just...
I said I don't want
to talk about it.
I want to head back.
You promised me one more day.
Forget about the Water Man.
It's just a bunch of crap.
No, it's not.
You saw him, right?
And that's exactly
how you got the scar, right?
Jo, right?
I didn't get the scar
from the Water Man.
But that's what you said!
I lied, okay? I lied.
No, you didn't. No.
You have no idea
what I've been through.
You won't get
the rest of the money, okay?
Our deal was that you had to
take me to find the Water Man.
I don't care about
your stupid money.
My mom is sick, Jo!
My mom is really sick!
Everyone thinks
she'll never get better...
the doctors, the nurses,
even my own dad.
It's everyone except me.
I really need to find
the Water Man, Jo.
Everyone you love
will one day leave you.
They'll die or just pack
their bags and leave.
Your mom is still alive.
You should go home, Gunner.
I don't need you.
Okay? I don't need you!
I'm going to find the Water Man
with or without you.
Fine. I'm going back by myself.
Gunner!
Gunner!
Gunner!
Ah! Ow!

Hello?
I seen you walking.
My name's... My name's
Gunner Boone.
I know who you are.
It's a dangerous thing
you've done, coming out here.
I'm here to find the Water Man.
My mom's sick.
Everyone has given up on her.
And if the Water Man
could cheat death...
The power you seek
comes at a price.
A heavy price.
I'll do anything you ask.
I searched for her
night and day in that lake
and in the forest,
but this cursed place
seems to revel in my plight!
I died in that flood.
But this stone brought me back.
Upon its touch, the dead
will surely rise.
But they'll outlive
all they know and love.
The hope of finding Sarah
is all I have
until this wretched body
erodes to nothing.
Why would I give to you
all the hope I have...
Gunner Boone!
Gunner!
Help! Gunner!
Sarah?
That's not Sarah. That's Jo.
I see.
You abandoned your friend.
- No.
- Yes, you did.
- N-No.
- You did.
For this.
The stone.
It gave you hope.
Made you believe.
Of course he's real.
I hung black stones
all around the forest
to mark where I had searched.
Hope is a powerful force.
It made you see...
what you wanted to see.
It made you see...
me.
You should go home, Gunner.
Help me!
Help me!
Gunner!
Jo! Jo!
Jo.
Jo! Jo!
My dad gave me the scar.
I'm so sorry.
What do we do?
Gunner!
Dad?
Dad!
Gunner!
Dad!
Ohh!
- Can you swim?
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay, let's go!
- No, Dad, I...
Dad, I can't go
in the water, Dad!
- I can't!
- Gunner. Gunner. Gunner.
I'm gonna get you across.
Okay? Promise.
I'm gonna get you across.
Let's go!
Get on my back.
Okay?
You're safe.
Mom. Ah!
Ah! Mom, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I thought I could save you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mom, I'm sorry.
It's okay, baby.
It's not your fault.
It's okay.
Hey. What's that?
Oh, just...
something I found in the woods.
I got you something to say
sorry for ruining your book.
What do you think?
Thanks, Dad, but, um...
I'm done with it.
What?
Why?
I just can't
figure out the ending.
It might take some time,
but you'll figure it out.
"Detective Knox and the
Missing Body" is a great story.
- Did you read it?
- Yeah, I did.
I love it. It's amazing.
Story about a detective
trying to investigate
what ended his own life.
You should stick with it.
Hey, Dad...
If you had to choose
between a short life
with a lot of love in it and...
a very long life with
no one left to love,
which one would you choose?
I would take a short life
with your mom in it...
...than a long one without her.
Me too.
Here come the burgers!
- Whoo!
- Nice!
Mmm.
Oh, these look good.
These look crispy.
Can I have extra cheese on mine?
I think we're all gonna need
extra cheese.
Should've listened to Mom
and kept the heat lower.
Think we should go vegan
after this.
Dear God, thank you
for this very well done,
crispy meal.
And for this family.
And for bringing Jo
into our lives.
And...
For the blessing
of loving each other,
every day that we have.
- Amen.
- Amen.
