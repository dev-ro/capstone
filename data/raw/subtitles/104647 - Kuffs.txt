[Continues]
[Woman]
George.!
Hey.
[Yelps]
George.
Oh, George.
[Laughing]
[Whistling]
Well, I'm heavenly blessed
and worldly wise
I'm a Peeping Tom techie
with X-ray eyes
Things are goin'great, and
they're only gettin'better
I'm doin'all right

The future's so bright

I gotta wear shades
Ow, ow, ow
George?
[Panting]
Uh-huh.
I'm pregnant,
George.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Oh.
Well, how long?
Over two months.
[Stops]
[Sighs]
Wow. Maya pregnant.
[Sighing]
Oh, God.
Oh, by the way,
my name is George Kuffs.
I've known her
for about six months.
I think I love her, but, uh,
I mean, pregnant?
That means responsibility.
You know, I've got...
I've got women to do,
places to see, you know?
You watch. Her first words
when she comes back here...
"What do you think, Georgie?"
I'll tell you what I think.
I'm history. That's what I think!
I just got fired
from my last job.
If I'm on my own, that's fine.
But with a wife and a child,
that doesn't make too much
sense, now, does it?
I didn't even graduate high school,
and she's still in college.
How the hell would
I support her, huh?
She definitely would be
better off without me.
George?
Do you want something soft
and romantic or rock and roll?
Mm. Rock and roll, definitely.
[Sighs]
So, uh, when I do leave her,
don't think I'm too big
of a cretin, okay? Okay.
[Sighing]
So, what do you think?
[Scoffs]
About what?
Yeah, whizzing along at
twice the speed of sound
My mind's mach two before
I ever leave the ground
Altitude is high
I just gotta go fast
I've got to find me a way
to make the feelin'last
There's only one thing I need
I need more speed
- Come on!
- We're outta here!
I got the need for speed
I got the need for speed
See ya next week.
I got the need for speed
Yeah, yeah
All right, hold it!
I said hold it!
You.
I told you
to stay out of this, cop!
Let's go! Go!
[Sirens Wailing In Distance]
[All Talking At Once]
- Lf we'd stop talking at once...
- Wait! Wait a minute, everybody!
Brad, look, I have
lived here for 30 years,
and this is the worst
it has ever been.
Just wait.
- This is still a good district.
- I'm with you, Brad.
Let's give ourselves
a chance.
We're doubling up on the shifts.
That should cut response time
even further.
And I'm trying to hire
another guy.
Howdy. Nice to see you again.
You might be a little curious
about this turkey here.
Then again you might not,
but I'm gonna tell you
about it anyway.
See this building right here?
It's my brother's business.
I haven't actually
seen him for a while,
and today happens
to be his birthday.
And turkey
is his favorite food.
So, surprise, surprise...
I'm gonna cook this for him.
Then I'm gonna try and
squeeze him for another loan.
But, uh, let's keep that
between you and me for now.
That... That would be...
That would be good.
[Grunts]
Jesus.
[Honking]
No, no, no.!
Hey! Whoa! Hey!
Hey!
[Groans]
Fuck.
Thank you.!
Well, that's that.
["Happy Birthday" In Chinese]
Huh?
Here they come.
George.
Happy birthday.
Cheers.
[Singing]
Mm-hmm!
Oh, look.
Yes.
Thank you, all.
Thank you very much.
Oh. Oop.
[Speaking Chinese]
Oh, George.
Yeah, nice, huh?
Well...
I spent my last dollar
on that turkey.
So, happy birthday, Brad.
George, what
do you want? Hmm?
Oh, let's see.
Uh, first of all,
are you aware of the gold rush
that's going on over in Brazil?
No. No, I wasn't
aware of that.
But let me guess...
if you had the money,
you would go.
Absolutely.
Exactly, exactly.
All I need is four grand,
and I'm history.
Four grand?
Yeah.
[Laughing]
Right.
What? What's so funny?
You.
Well, here.
Make a wish.
I'm sorry, George.
Looks like I'm gonna
have to do my shift.
I tried to get hold of Bill.
It's his night off.
I don't know where he is.
Take a look at this.
$50 million, huh?
This is what I'm talking about.
This is the kind of money
I can make in Brazil.
[Chuckling]
Right.
What about 2,500?
What about you
work for me?
You could live with me,
go to the academy during
the day,
patrol with me at night
until you finish the training.
That's not exactly
what I have in mind, you know?
I killed a guy
in a holdup yesterday.
Last week, the leader of
his gang offered me a bribe.
He said it better than this,
but essentially he asked me...
to look the other way
while he ripped up my district.
Something big is going down.
I don't know what it is.
You're my brother. I'd kind of
like you to get my back.
Well, that's very nice
of you, but, uh,
I never really saw
myself as a cop.
I'm more like the bad guys.
I don't like rules very much,
and this sounds like
a nine-to-five thing.
I want the big score. I want
the brass ring, the pot of gold,
and then I wanna retire.
That's the American dream.
If I settle for nine-to-five
now, my life's over. That's it.
I never
thought of it that way.
I'll find somebody else.
I promise, when I hit it big,
I'll retire you, okay?
[Panting]
Hold the bus!
Hold the bus!
Look, you are...
You are 21 years old, George.
Thirty comes awfully fast.
And if you are still
loafing around the world
and bumming money from me...
when you are 30 years old...
I'm gonna be awfully
disappointed in you.
I always go in here
before I start my shift.
You want to come in?
Uh, maybe in a second.
I gotta make a phone call.
Ah.
Hey, uh, Brad?
I'm sorry about some
of the things I said back there.
Come on.
When I was 21,
I probably thought
the same way.
I hope you get everything
you want, kid.
I may even be able
to give you some money.
God bless you.
- I'll pay you back.
- Right.
He's a pretty cool guy,
ain't he? Yeah.
After our parents died,
he got stuck with
the thankless job...
of raising little ol' me.
I think he did
a pretty good job myself.
Now, about Maya and me.
Maybe I should give her a call.
In my note,
I, uh...
I told her she'd be
better off without me.
I don't know if that's so true.
I mean, I miss her.
[Speaking Latin]
Amen.
You should have
taken the money.
Brad?
Help me, George.
Help me.
[Groans]
[Emergency Room Chatter]
[Nurse]
Sir, you can't be in here.
You're going to
have to wait outside.
You George Kuffs?
I'm Captain Morino,
San Francisco P.D.
I'm in charge
of the patrol specials.
Your brother's
a friend of mine.
Based on your description,
we believe we've picked up
the man who shot him.
I'd like you to come down
to the station with me and I D him.
[Emergency Room Chatter]
Okay.
[Man On P.A., Indistinct]
- Why did you shoot my brother?
- Captain.
Let's take
the stairs, kid.
Why did you shoot my brother?
- Piss off!
- You're going to jail!
Kid, you don't know shit
about shit!
[Chuckling]
Hey, Stuart Burkis
is a thousand an hour.
What is he doing defending
this guy Kane?
I don't know.
Somebody ought
to find out.
Kuffs. Peter Coca,
D.A.'s office.
How's it going?
You ready?
Sure.
I've already identified
Kane once now, haven't I?
Well, not officially.
Let's go.
Yeah, that's... That's him
right there on the end.
You sure?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.
Captain, can I
see you a minute?
Sure.
Wait a second. You didn't see him
pull the trigger?
- No.
- I can't hold him.
What do you mean
you can't hold him?
Let me tell you how
it's gonna go down.
This guy Kane, he heard shots.
He runs to the front
of the church. He sees
your brother lying there.
There's a gun.
He picks it up.
You burst through the doors.
He thinks you're the gunman.
Wait. He thinks
I'm the gunman?
Let me finish!
He thought you were the gunman
who was gonna come back
and kill him, so he ran.
That's if he admits he was in
the church in the first place. He hasn't.
The priest didn't see anything.
There's no corroborating witnesses.
There's no fingerprints
on the gun.
It's your word against his.
He's about to tell me that
the guy that shot my brother
is gonna get away.
He's the lawyer.
Would you excuse us?
I want to talk
to Kuffs alone.
He may be guilty, kid, but
guilt's what I can prove. I'm sorry.
The hospital just called.
Brad's dead.
[Moans]
Jes...
Are you sure?
Yeah.
I pulled your brother's file.
He left you his district.
That means that you now own
the right, along with the police,
to protect and serve
the citizens of District 33.
And you have the right
to solicit funds for those services.
You own Brad's district.
You can do what you want with it...
rent it, lease it, sell it.
You don't have to tell me
right away, but soon.
I'm sorry.
He was a good man.
[Sniffles]
[Man Laughing]
Oh, I
[Phone Ringing]
Gotta leave a little while
Don't ask me why
Hello?
And I
Hello.
I don't mean
to make you cry
George.
My love
George, is this you?
There's a light shining bright
In my eyes tonight
George?
But I still see your face
through the night
Look, George, if this is you,
I don't want to talk to you.
I don't want to live without you
George, is this you?
Oh, no, I won't walk away
Where are you?
I don't want to live without you
You okay?
George?
No one
Could ever take your place
Well, "broski, '"this is
the nicest spot I could find you.
I don't believe
what happened.
They, uh... They caught
the son of a bitch that killed you.
Then they let him go.
I have no idea
what to do about that.
I don't think I, uh,
ever really told you this
while you were alive, but...
[Sighs]
I love you.
Excuse me.
Mr. Kuffs?
They told me
I'd find you here.
My name
is Sam Jones.
Hi.
I know this might not
be the right time...
and please don't think
badly of me...
but I understand your brother
left you his district.
Yeah, he did.
I want you to consider
selling it to me.
Since you're not in the field
of law enforcement,
this could be
a great opportunity
for both of us...
you to make some money,
and me,
I get to put a good, strong man
in your brother's position.
I'll give you
$100,000 now...
and $1,000 a month
for the next two years.
That's it. That's my spiel.
Yeah, that, uh,
sounds wonderful,
but could you give me
some time to think it over?
I wouldn't expect anything less.
Here's my card.
It has my home number
on there. Call me anytime.
I'll be expecting your call.
Sorry about your brother.
Have a nice day.
[Singing, Indistinct]
[Coins Rattle]
You sure have to make
serious choices in life, don't you?
[Phone Rings]
Patrol Special.
[Bell Jingles]
Hey, Harriet.
Nikki, Mr. Brown
is on line two.
I'm busy.
Not bad.
[Nikki]
You're three weeks
late again, Mr. Brown.
[Toilet Flushing]
Hiya, kid. Just the man
I wanted to see.
Can I buy you
a free cup of coffee?
Show me the way, Bill.
I'm not quite sure exactly
what's going on here.
[Continues, Indistinct]
We should start talking
about how much you want
for the business.
I have a little saved up.
I can get some from...
my mother.
I'm sure the bank
would lend me the rest.
Well, uh, that's very nice
of you, Bill, but, uh,
believe it or not, I've decided
to take the job myself.
Come again?
I'm gonna be your boss, Bill.
- You're gonna what, kid?
- [Sighs]
He's a kid. Even if he
becomes a patrol special,
he doesn't have the experience
to run a district.
I do not want to hear "kid"
from this guy ever again.
I am not a kid!
Calm down.
Kid, kid, kid.
Would you tell him
that, please?
He's not a kid.
Brad said I could go to
the academy during the day and
patrol with somebody at night.
That's what I'm gonna do.
I spoke to the lawyer
from the D.A.'s office.
He said the district's mine.
I'm taking it.
Has he ever been convicted
of a felony? I'll bet he has.
Shut up, Bill!
Have you?
No.
Did you graduate
high school?
Yes.
You have to go through
the academy.
I know, I know.
He's gonna have to get
his hair cut, put on a uniform
and get rid of that attitude!
I'm only gonna stick
around until I clean up
the neighborhood.
Look, Kuffs...
That's the least
I can do for my brother.
Oh, God damn it.
Why me? L...
Bill, this is his district.
There's nothing I can do
about that.
You think you've won?
Think again!
Look, I understand
how you feel.
Will you understand that
I don't want you here either?
I heard about
Sam Jones's offer.
If you don't want
to sell to Bill, fine.
Take that. It's a great offer.
You don't know
what you're getting into.
Captain, trust me.
L... I can handle this.
Sure, and I just heard
turds can fly.
Hear me.
The first time you screw up
in any way...
or if I catch you
going after Kane,
you're out of business.
[Bailiff]
Court is now in session.
Well, it's good to know
I have a loyal support team.
What he doesn't realize is
the first time I screw up,
I'll probably be dead.
[Ringing]
Oh, God!
Thank God
this is only temporary.
Imagine getting up
at 5:00 in the morning
for the rest of your life?
It's worse than
nine-to-five.
At least I still have you.
[Chuckles]
Old Reliable. Oh!
This is only part of it.
Wait until you see the uniform.
It's beautiful.
Well, what do
you think, huh?
Even comes with a, uh,
matching hat.
Feel like a dork.
Let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
Sir.
[Panting]
Why are we doing
so much running? Aren't we
all going to be in cars?
Move it, asshole!
Move it!
Move it! Move it!
This might have been
a terrible mistake.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
I'm looking for a really big gun
that holds a lot of bullets.
God bless you, young man.
I always wanted a gun.
Is this what
you had in mind?
It's a 9-millimeter
Beretta.
Fifteen in the clip,
one in the pipe.
Is there one that holds more?
No.
I'll take two.
[Man, Indistinct
Under Gunfire]
You probably won't hit anything.
That's what I'm here for.
All right.
[Gunshots In Rapid Fire]
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?
Never shot a gun
before in my life.
You're a natural, kid.
Really? Is there such a thing
as being a natural at shooting?
You betcha.
You mean I have talent?
At shooting. Let's see
if you can do that again.
Let me have
another target.
At the start of your shift,
you report here and
you sign the log book.
Right.
At the end of your shift, you
come back and you sign out...
if you don't get killed.
Hey, Nikki, did you happen
to get that address on Kane
I asked for?
Oh, yeah. Here.
It was in the book.
Eh! Killer in the phone book...
never would've thought of that.
I don't know if you should
go gunning for Kane
on your first night.
I'm not gunning for him.
I'm just gonna swing by
and see what he's up to.
It's out of our district, George.
It's all right. I can afford
the gas. What's next?
Okay. You read
the reports of the day.
Then you check the Teletype,
then the reports of incidents.
Any ques...
Kuffs!
This is Ted Bukovsky. He'll
be riding around with you
the next couple weeks.
Nikki, you can go home.
Wait one minute,
Nikki.
Captain?
May I talk to you
for a moment?
Sure.
Listen, you're
really undermining
my confidence here...
right in front
of one of my employees.
How the hell do you
expect me to develop
leadership abilities...
and learn how to make
decisions on my own if I have
a chaperone like Ted around?
Who gives a shit?
Oh.
Well, I can't afford him.
I went through the books
last night.
My brother was living
month to month.
I'm almost broke here.
No. I went through the books too.
You are broke.
A lot of people dropped the service
when you took over.
You got a week and a half,
two weeks tops. Then you're gone.
You're history, and no lawyer
in the world can help you.
Ted is here to keep you out
of trouble while you're among us.
[Sighs]
You must have messed up
pretty bad to deserve me, huh, Ted?
[Scoffs]
Look, kid.
I'm a cop, okay?
Personally, I think you patrol
specials are door-rattling jokes.
Now, we can talk,
we can tell each other lies,
we might even become friends.
But in the next two weeks, if you do
anything that makes me look bad,
I'll break you in half, okay?
You get laid much, Ted?
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
[Chuckles]
Uh, Ted, before we go,
I gotta run to the "toidey."
I'll meet you back here.
You...
"Toidey"?
Well, I'm sure Ted is the victim
of an unhappy childhood,
and, some day, some psychiatrist
could release the caring human
that's struggling to get out.
But right now,
I don't have the time.
Could you please tell me where
the Narcotics Division is?
Thank you.
[George]
All right, all right, Doug.
I'll be honest with you.
Ever since my brother passed away,
I'm having a bit of trouble sleeping.
Mm-hmm.
Doug said half of one of these
would make you sleep...
like you had a tit
in your mouth for eight hours.
I don't know.
Ted's a pretty big guy, isn't he?
Should I? Yeah, sure.
Better to be safe.
Stir it up.
Oop.
I'm real sorry about what I said.
I got you a cup of coffee.
Next time,
shit before you sign in.
Shit! Sign in!
In the car!
Am I gonna be tested
on this later?
Maybe.
You're not drinking your coffee.
I don't like hot coffee.
I like cold coffee.
Turn right at the next street.
You have some customers
at the end of the block.
[Whistling]
[Yawning]
That's the guy
that shot my brother.
[Ted]
Stop.! Stop.!
[Horn Honking]
Look out!
Turn! Turn!
Turn! Turn!
- Stop the car!
- We're gonna lose him!
Are you crazy?
Stop the car!
Are you [Beep]
Trying to kill me?
What are you so angry about?
I wanted to follow the guy.
Did you see a [Buzzer] crime
being committed?
Did you see a [Distorted Note]
Crime being committed?
If we follow him, we will
see a [Buzzer] crime
being committed.
You are a [Electronic Note]
Patrol special. You don't go
looking for a [Buzzer] crime!
If you see a [Distorted Note]
Crime being committed,
then you take action.
Otherwise, your
[Distorted Note] job
is to service those people...
who are stupid enough
to hire you to protect them.
And if I'm gonna get killed
on this job, it's gonna be
by a [Electronic Note] bullet,
not by
a [Electronic Note] bus!
Now turn this [Distorted Note]
Car around and let's get back on
your [Distorted Note] patrol!
You have a limited
vocabulary, Ted.
Fuck you.
[Honking]
[Rattle, Echoing]
If you liked those, stick around.
I got a hundred more.
[Honking]
Come on.
One of your customers
is getting robbed.
I knew it.
I knew it!
[Police Radio Chatter]
[George] I told you
this would happen. I told you
we shouldjust follow Kane.
We'd have him right now.
Stupid rookies.
Always think you're gonna hit
the big score your first night.
I'm a stupid rookie?
How much do you want
to bet it's Kane?
A billion dollars.
Fine.
Get out! Get out of my store!
Look at my store!
You can't protect me! Your
brother was good, but you shit!
Calm down, sir.
Calm down.
We'll be right back.
Thank you, Mr. Chang.
Get out of my store!
Ted, I told you. Four guys
in a green station wagon.
You owe me
a billion dollars.
Where you going?
I'm gonna go get Kane.
I can't let you do that.
Well, try and stop me.
[Groans]
Now calm down. We're gonna
take this guy's statement
and write up a report.
You leave me
no choice, Ted.
I'm gonna have to hurt you.
That's it.
Oh, man.
Don't you see that getting Kane
would be as good for you
as it would for me?
[Groaning]
I guess you don't.
- You're pretty good at this.
- Thank you.
Do you give up?
Look, you don't have
to come with me.
Just say I ditched you.
I'll give you money for a cab.
I can't.
[Siren Wails]
Shit.
- [Car Door Slams]
- What the hell is going on
around here, Bukovsky?
[Panting]
Just investigating an armed
robbery. Same as you, Sergeant.
- Is he a suspect?
- No. We were just...
trying to decide who's
gonna write up the report.
Don't try and
dick me around, Bukovsky.
You're already on probation.
I'll run your ass in for
assaulting another officer.
Now, did he start
the fight?
Officer Bukovsky was, uh,
just being kind enough to
show me some moves I missed...
during self-defense class.
- You're the new patrol special, aren't you?
- Yeah.
Word to the wise, kid.
Your brother was a good man.
Don't cock up his memory.
Let's check
the damage inside.
George.
I'm sorry
about your brother.
Hey.
I bet you I know where
this Kane guy lives.
[Ted]
Is that him?
[George] Yeah.
Good. Now we know he's home.
Let's get outta here.
Come on.
He's up there with his gang.
Five more minutes.
Now.!
[Honking]
Wait one second.
[Laughing]
- Huh.
- You were right.
He was up there
with his gang.
[Chattering]
I think you saw someone else
in the green station wagon.
What could they possibly see
in a man that dresses that badly?
They have to be his alibi.
That's the only explanation.
[Car Alarm Beeps]
[Ted]
You're not gonna follow him.
I think we should
follow the cab.
[BellJingles]
What do you think he's doing
in a Chinese laundry
this time of night?
You saw his gang.
He needs clean sheets.
Oh, yeah. "Tedster,"
I meant to ask you before.
What, uh... What are you
on probation for, anyway?
Moral turpitude.
[Chuckles]
Moral turpitude?
What'd you do, sleep
with the captain's wife
or something?
No. The chief's.
[Laughing]
That's cool.
I didn't know
she was the chief's wife.
I picked her up in the supermarket,
in the frozen foods.
Hmm.
Is she, uh...
Is she pretty?
She's great.
She's a lot younger
than the chief.
That's great.
Way to go, Tedster.
What the hell
has he got there?
A tube of clothing.
[Scoffs]
You wanted to go to his house.
We did. You wanted
to follow him. We did.
This guy's not happening.
Let's get back to work.
Uh, what was...
What was in that cup?
Coffee.
Yeah. Where'd you get it?
- You gave it to me.
- Right.
[Clearing Throat]
[Harriet] Car one,
this is control. Do you copy?
It's for you.
Car one, this is control.
Answer it.
Go ahead.
Car one, this is control.!
- Hello?
- Car one, we have an emergency
at 342 Kearney.
There's a jumper
on the fifth floor.
George, you're all I've got.
This is a customer call.
Thejumper is on the ledge.
Shit, did you
see that?
What?
It's Sam Jones.
Who?
Sam Jones.
Come on!
George!
[Harriet]
George, do you copy?
[Ted] George.! Wait.!

Watch out.
There he is.

["Smashing Into Wall"
Sound Effect]
[Groaning]
Whoo!
[Mumbling]
Okay.
[Woman On P.A.]
Attention, please.
Will Ms. Wills please contact
the station agent at extension 4123.
[Whistle Sounds]
What the hell you think's
in that tube, huh?
[Groans]
Ted?
Next Concord-bound train
will arrive at MacArthur
in two minutes.
Ted?
[Ted] I'm okay. I'm all right.
[Harriet]
George, are you there?
I'm all right!
Are you sure?
[Harriet]
Where in the hell did you go?
We're on our way.
No. We gotta go to the laundry.
We're going to the jumper.
You need a search warrant
for a Chinese laundry.
Move it.
Move it!
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.
I'm all right!
[Engine Starts]
[Stomach Gurgling]
Stop looking at me.
[Groaning]
Stop looking at me.
I'm okay. It's just...
something I ate or stress.
[Stomach Gurgling]
[Snoring]
[Tires Screech]
[Snoring]
[Grunts] Ted. Ted?
Ted? Oh, shit.
Ah! Ted!
Jesus! I'm sorry.
L... I'm sorry about
the coffee, all right?
I didn't know you'd turn
out to be such a nice guy!
[Burps]
Ted, Ted, Ted! Wake up!
Come on, Ted.
I don't know what the hell
to do with a jumper!
Ted. Ted!
Ted, come on.!
Ah, don't snore, Ted.
Come on, Ted.
Wake up, buddy.
I need your help.
Come on!
Come on, come on!
Come on.
Wake up, Ted.
[Snoring]
Ooh. Uh, why don't you
stay with the radio, Ted?
He's gonna stay
with the radio.
You see that?
You see that? I want you
to get that son of a bitch
off my building right now.
Maybe we should wait
for the police?
You are the police!
What the hell you think
I'm paying you for?
He's awfully high up there.
How'd he get up there?
Don't you lock
your building at night?
- Kuffs?
- Maya.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were in Brazil.
- Uh, well, l...
- Where are you going?
You remember Robert?
Hi.
Yeah.
Come on. He's gonna jump.
Come on.
It's bad luck if he jumps.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
Are you a cop now?
I'll talk to you in a second.
What the hell took you so long?
I've been waitin' all night.
Okay. Now, he's down here.
Did you see that?
Maya with Robert?
I don't get it.
She left him for me.
Come on, come on.
Maybe they're just friends.
Then again, maybe they're not.
You think he's
better looking than I am?
Come on!
Okay. He's out there.
Now go ahead and do your stuff.
Go ahead.
Howdy.
Pretty nice view
you have here.
Would you... Would you mind
coming on back inside here, please?
Please?
He doesn't want
to come in.
What do you mean?
Look, this is my first
day on the job.
I have no idea what to say
to a potential suicide.
It's simple, sonny.
You want to keep your business?
You get him in here,
or you don't get paid.
I see.
Go ahead.
Hey, asshole!
Yes, you. Look, if you're
gonna jump, jump.
Otherwise, use the bridge
like everybody else.
- You're screwing up traffic down there.
- Say what? Are you crazy?
- How'd I do?
- What do you mean?
- That's all I could think of.
- What do you mean that's
all you could think of?
- It's the best I can do.
- You gotta do better than that.
Ooh! Ooh!
He's coming in.
- He's coming in!
- Is he?
- I'll be a son of a bitch. It worked.
- Of course it worked.
[George]
Let's stand back and give
the guy some room here.
I knew it was gonna work.
I'm a professional.
Let's get him a chair.
- You! Cop!
- Hey.
Die!
Maya Carlton?
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
I just came to see
if you were all right.
I've really got to go.
Wait a second.
Um, I want to apologize
to you...
about my note.
That was...
That was not good.
No, it wasn't.
You, uh,
you look amazing.
You know, when I saw you
coming down on that stretcher,
l... I almost died.
Mmm.
Was that you
on the phone?
Yeah. Yeah,
that was me.
George! George, come on!
You're getting a hard-on.
I can't help it. It's you.
- No, it's you.
- Yeah.
Uh, look, what are you doing
with this Robbie character?
Kuffs, come on.
You left me.
Yeah, right.
Does he, uh...
Does he know about the child?
You know, I don't need Robert
and I don't need you.
I've got to go.
I just wanted to see
if you were all right.
Take care of yourself.
Women.
Well, Capt. Morino wouldn't
give me the search warrant
for the laundry.
Ted got suspended.
He doesn't know that yet.
He's still asleep.
I don't know, maybe it's just
the post-gunshot blues,
but I'm beginning to feel like
I'm not exactly cut out for
this line of work, you know?
[Sighs]
Want to see what a gunshot
wound looks like?
[Groaning]
Gotta say my point of view
on guns has changed.
Do cause
quite a bit of pain.
[Dog Barking]
See, the, uh, bullet
went in here...
and then it came out the back.
You feel it hit, and then
there's this, uh,
this kind of a sharp pain.
And then it goes numb.
Yeah.
Scarier than shit.
Now, the guy who jumped,
he was a, uh, a writer.
Ooh! Tried to kill himself
twice before.
[Sighing]
I don't know.
I know Kane killed my brother.
I know Sam Jones is in it with him.
What the hell can I do about it?
I don't have any money.
In two weeks, I'm probably
gonna lose the business
anyway.
There's this $50,000
balloon payment due
on change of ownership...
that Capt. Morino
hasn't spotted yet.
That's it, that's it.
I'm doomed.
If you're not the cleaning lady,
you're in the wrong apartment.
[Laughing]
I've come to make peace,
Mr. Kuffs.
I'm sorry you think
I killed your brother.
I didn't, but I do represent
certain business interests
in your district.
There's a $25,000
down payment for your services.
Most of the time,
all we'll ask you to do
is look the other way.
You took your brother's job,
Mr. Kuffs.
You could have a future here.
Then again,
you might not.
[Whistles]
[Sighing]
I think I like having a future.
Thank you, Lee.
Aah!
We're gonna die, Sam!
Oh, I scared you,
didn't I? [Cackles]
You're in big trouble, kid.
Sam, I gotta tell ya.
I was pretty set to quit
the business this morning.
Then your little buddy, Kane,
dropped by, offered me a bribe...
$25,000 to look the other way
while you tear up my district.
I asked for 50,000.
We settled on 37,500.
I think I did pretty good.
Capt. Morino, please.
It's Sam Jones.
It's an emergency.
Police? I'd better
talk fast, huh?
You're into a
land-grab scam, Sam.
Now, the problem is,
you're greedy!
You don't want to pay
top dollar, and people don't
actually want to sell to you.
So you use Kane and his hoods
to come in, shake everybody up...
and then you come in like
a savior with bags of money
and buy everything up!
See, I did a little
research on you.
You're a big shot
art collector,
a major player
on the charity circuit.
You're rich, so you think
you're above the law.
But you've made
two mistakes now, Sam.
Number one, you had Kane
kill my brother.
Number two, the land
you're grabbing happens
to be in my district.
And in my district, Sambo,
I am the law.
Capt. Morino, one of your
patrol specials...
just broke into my car
and is threatening me.
George Kuffs.
He wants to talk to you.
[Morino, Indistinct]
Naw,
I don't think so.
[Hangs Up Receiver]
It's just you and me, Sam.
No corroborating witnesses.
Your word against mine.
Pull over right here, huh?
I'll walk the rest of the way.
I wish there were something
I could say, Mr. Kuffs,
to make you feel better
about yourself.
[Sighs]
I guess you could tell me
you're gonna leave town
for 200 or 300 years.
That'd make me feel
a little better.
Thank you.
Oh, God,
that felt good!
I almost told him I knew about
him and Kane and the laundry.
What if there were drugs
in that tube or something?
What he doesn't know I know
can hurt him, so why the hell
should I tell him, huh?
Yeah, you see,
this way I can stake him
and Kane out with my team.
I can catch them both
red-handed!
I like it.
It sounds good.
[Chattering]
[Jingles]
Guess what I have in the bag?
Capt. Morino wants you
to call him right away.
He sounded
really pissed off.
Yeah, in a minute.
Hey, guys,
what's going on?
Nothing personal, George,
but we all decided we don't
want you as our boss.
[Scoffs]
Well, this is a first.
A boss being fired by
his own employees.
Tell me, Bill, who do you think
should be boss, my little friend?
Me.
Nothing personal, Bill,
but, uh, you're fired.
You can't fire me.
These people want me.
We're not saying you can't own
the business, we're saying...
find somebody else
with experience to run it!
Is that what
you're saying?
That's right.
Well, listen.
Since I have taken this job,
I've been shouted at,
I've been bribed,
I've even been shot
for you people!
And now you're telling me
you don't believe in me?
This is what we're gonna do.
If Bill beats me in
a fair fight right here, right now,
not only can Bill be boss...
I'll give you the business for free.
- What do you say?
- You're not serious?
Yeah, I am.
But I gotta warn you,
I'm pretty good.
So if I win, I'm boss.
If I sayjump, your only answer
is "how high. '"
You're on.
Come on, Bill.
He was Golden Glove champion
twice, George. Forget it.
Hey, a deal's a deal.
You can't back out now.
All right, just
make it quick, Bill.
- You won't feel a thing.
- Thank you.
Ooh!
[Gasping]
I win!
Why didn't I think of that
last night with Ted?
Okay, that'll be $113.65.
All right.
What would you like
the card to say?
Ah, "Dear Maya,
"it was great seeing you
the other night.
Love and kisses on
all your pink parts. George."
I guess you hear that
all the time, don't you?
[Harriet] Come in, George.
Excuse me.
Yeah, come in. Ten-four.
[Harriet, Loud]
I got Bill on the line, and
Morino's called twice more.
You better call him soon.
Now, here's Bill.
Just checkin' in, boss. Sam Jones
got home 15 minutes ago.
[In High Voice]
Hasn't moved since.
All right. Why don't
you just call me back
in about a half hour?
May I ask you
a personal question?
Sure.
Have you ever, uh,
been married?
[Chuckles]
Goin' on 18 years.
Eighteen years.
Geez!
What's it like?
Is it still fun?
You still like her?
- Him.
- Oh.
Yeah, it's great. It has
its ups and downs, but it's great.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Have a nice day.
You too.
When do you think
she'll get these?
Well, I'll call Sacramento right away.
Say, by 2:00?
[Beeping]
[Nikki On Radio]
George, are you there?
I think I want to
change the card.
Yeah, come in.
I lost Kane.
He turned a corner
and I turned the corner,
and he just wasn't there.
I'm sorry, George.
I'm not very good at this.
That's quite all right, Nikki.
I have a good idea where he's going.
Why don't you go hang out
by the laundry or something?
Hey, wait! Weren't you
gonna change the card?
Right, right.
"Dear Maya,
I really, really miss you.
"Would love it if you
came to San Francisco
tonight for dinner.
But even if you can't,
I'd still love to talk
to you. Love, George."
Better.
Much better.
Yeah, I think so.
I am not interested
in selling at any price!
I understand
your store was robbed.
Yes.
Well, well, well.
Kane.
I should know you'd be
standing right next
to the toilet paper.
What are you doing here?
I fired you!
I know you fired me,
but you paid up through
next week, so here I am.
May I speak to you
for a moment, please?
Come on, come on!
Look, before we
get into this,
there's something I've
been meaning to ask you.
It's been bothering me
for quite some time now.
Where do you buy
your clothing?
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
My job.
See, I just overheard
you asking Mr. Chang
to sell his business.
He said he didn't want to,
but you persisted.
So as much as I like you,
Kane, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.
We had a deal, kid.
I paid you this morning.
Absolutely.
You hired me to protect
your interests, and I
fully intend to do that.
You see,
I also have a deal
with Mr. Chang.
And right now, you're on
his property. That's why
I have to ask you to leave.
Don't mess with me, kid.
You see, if Mr. Chang
were on your property...
and he was leaning on you,
I'd ask him to leave.
And then, if he didn't
do it fast enough,
I'd pull my gun
out of its holster
just like this...
and I would shout,
"Do we have
an understanding...
or do you want to see
if you can breathe
through your forehead?"
But I don't have to do that
with you, Kane, because
we're pals, aren't we?
You might not live
to regret this.
I've lived to regret almost
everything I've done.
See ya.
You are going to
get us all killed.
I hope not.
Think positive, Mr. Chang.
Maybe we'll get lucky and win.
[Line Ringing]
[Sighs]
He said he was going home.
But if he's there, he's
not answering his phone.
Try him again.
[Phone Ringing]
[Shower Running]
Hey! Well, Maya's
coming to dinner.
I guess the flowers
worked, huh?
Now get out
of my bathroom.
[Phone Ringing]
- Where's he stayin'?
- Brad's apartment.
If the son of a bitch calls in,
you tell him to meet me there...
and to cease and desist
all operations.
You tell him.
You tell him there's
a $50,000 balloon payment due
on the change of ownership...
and that his banker, Mr. Alan
Eddy, wants it today or he's
no longer a patrol special.
What you're doing
is shitty!
Dancin'
Like the floor's
on fire
And we're never
touching the ground
Well, she lifts me
A little bit higher
And our love
Well, there's no comin'down
She'll be runnin'red hot
I can't put out the flame
She tears me up
like a hurricane
She's a roller coaster
She's a tidal wave
She takes my breath
away
Oh, she takes
takes my breath
Takes my breath every time
she moves that way
All my words
Hard to say
Oh, she takes
my breath away
Watch out
She's like dynamite
And she could go off
anytime
Perfect.
Fascination
stimulation
What do you think?
Too subtle?
Now she's got me
so hypnotized
[Sighs]
She takes my breath away
Hey, hey, hey
[Buzzing]
Show time!
Well, she's early.
It's a good sign.
I know it's tacky to
answer the door half-dressed,
but that's me!
[Buzzing]
Gun, gun, gun!
Geez!
Shit!
[Screams]
[Grunting And Groaning]
Geez!
[Laughs Weakly]
It's on the fridge.
- Huh.
- [Chuckling]
[Clicks]
You lookin' for me?
[Buzzing]
[Screams]
[Gunshot]
[Buzzing]
It's Maya.
- How's it goin'?
- Hi, George.
You remember my parents?
They just came in for the opera.
Oh. Yeah, of course.
Mrs. Carlton, Mr. Carlton.
- Doctor Carlton.
- Right. Doctor Carlton.
Aren't you going to
invite us in?
Uh, sure.
Uh, just a sec.
Jesus.
[Chuckles]
I'm not having too much luck
with turkeys now, am I?
Shit.
Do you believe this?
Maybe we could just go out
for drinks or something?
You and I
have got to have a talk.
Well, let me
throw a shirt on.
- What happened here?
- Ah... termites.
What's this?
- Is he dead?
- God, I hope so.
Well...
What a lovely apartment
you have here.
- [Buzzing]
- Why don't you guys go
to the back bedroom?
I think that'd
be a good idea.
What?
Come on. Keep moving.
Where's the bathroom?
Straight back. Straight back.
Bedroom's to the right.
[Retching]
Raise
the toilet seat.
Go.
Freeze, assholes!
Geez.
I'm sorry.
That's your banker.
No.
[Police Radio Chatter]
Hey, I'm real sorry about
your tongue, but I didn't
know it was you guys.
No, no, no.
You were great!
You scared the shit out of me!
And you killed the guy
who was trying to kill you!
We got a good man here, Captain.
I think you're gonna make
a great patrol special.
What about the money
he owes you?
This is not
what he does.
He's not a patrol special.
He's a screw-up.
He got lucky.
Hold it,
Capt. Morino.
Mr. Kuffs here, he just
offered me a $10,000
down payment on that loan.
And we have a saying
in the banking business:
"Never trust a bald barber.
He has no respect for your hair."
Good night, gentlemen.
A strange little guy,
but I think I like him.
Now, if you could just
get me the search warrant
for Mr. Wang's laundry.
It just so happens that
it's closed tomorrow.
Then you could reinstate Ted.
I think everything would
be back to neat.
Can't reinstate Ted.
The chief's wife
just moved in with him.
I'll see what I can do
about the laundry.
[Retching]
Not on the seat,
dear.
Jesus.
Bye.
Now, you call me.
Hi.
Hi.
I was cooking us a turkey.
Yeah, I know. I saw
the black sheets.
What do you want to do
tonight, George?
Whatever you want to do.
All right.
Let's do something
that we've never done.
Yeah?
Yeah.
[George]
Tattoos, huh? It's not
exactly what I expected.
When you said
you wanted to do something
we'd never done before,
I thought it'd be more along
the sexual line, you know?
[Chuckles]
Let me see it.
Can I see it?
You want to see it?
All right.
Yeah. Oh!
Ohh.
Kind of painful.
[Laughs]
It's so cute.
It's really sexy.
I'm telling you, it is.
Sexy?
Yeah.
I don't wanna live
without you
Let me, uh...
Let me see yours.
I won't walk away
See it?
You like it?
It's very cute.
It's beautiful.
No one
Could ever take your place
There's a road
A road I've got to take
Don't ask me why
Some day
It'll all be worth the wait
[Continues, Indistinct]
[Panting]
I love you, George.
But I guess you have your life
to live and I have mine.
I, uh...
I love you too.
I don't want to live
without you
You're gonna have to
make up your mind
someday, George.
I won't walk away
I don't want to
live without you
No one could ever
take your place
[Applause]
- We're all here to sign up.
- All right.
Good work
last night.
Thank you.
George?
[Nikki]
They got here about
five minutes ago.
Wonderful.
What do they want?
I have no idea.
Well, did Capt. Morino
get the search warrant
for the Chinese laundry?
No, not yet.
All right.
Have a doughnut.
Hey, Sammy!
Bet you wish I were dead,
don't you?
Officer Favaro,
would you excuse us
for a minute?
Yeah, we'd, uh,
like to be alone.
I usually don't do
these things myself.
Hmm.
But since you broke
into my car yesterday,
I knew you
had to be stopped.
I really don't think you're
the man for that job, Sammy.
[Scoffs]
[Sighs]
Talk to me, Sam.
This is your transcript
from Fremont High School
in Modesto, California.
You went to Fremont,
didn't you?
Maybe.
Maybe?
It says here you dropped out
in the 10th grade.
Did you drop out
in the 10th grade?
Tsk-tsk. To be a patrol special,
you have to have
a high school diploma.
You don't have a high school
diploma, do you?
No.
You lied on your application,
defrauded the city of San Francisco...
and Officer Favaro's
here to arrest you.
You're out of here, kid.
And I get your district
anyway, and it doesn't
cost me $100,000.
It'll be nice to own
my own police force.
Amazing, the power
of a piece of paper.
[Paper Hits Desk]
Officer Favaro?
You didn't really think
you could beat me, did you, kid?
Bye.
Sorry, George.
It's unbelievable!
Sam Jones is gonna get
away with everything...
because I didn't
finish high school?
Uh, before we go up,
I have to go to the bathroom.
No, George.
Come on.
Give me a break.
No, no, no.
It's not like I'm a
mass murderer, okay?
I lied on a stupid
application. That's all.
Please?
I don't know why
I'm doing this.
I don't know why
I'm doing this.
God bless you.
- You got one minute.
- It's number two, Favaro.
Would you give me
a break, please?
Thank you.
I've escaped!
Hey, Doug.
I've got another problem.
Mm-hmm.
Well, this here is Thunder.
Doug loaned him to me.
If it's illegal, supposedly
Thunder can smell it.
Right?
[Barking]
Now, we're gonna go
into the laundry,
but first we're gonna
stop by Ted's, see if
he wants to join us.
All right?
[Barking]
No way, George.
I'll never ask you for
another thing as long as I live.
No, George.
I'm not interested.
Come on, Ted.
- Oh, is that the chief's wife?
- Yeah.
She moved in right after
you almost poisoned me.
And there you have it.
So you owe me.
What's that?
Uh, come on, Ted.
Open the door.
The last time I owed you a favor,
you almost killed me.
Look, I just want you
there at my back.
If Sam Jones gets away with this,
I lose everything.
No.
I can still see you.
[Whistling]
Come on, Te...
[Sighs]
All right, Ted.
Thanks a lot!
Look, if something
happens to me, you know,
I don't want you to
feel bad or anything, okay?
If I get killed or something,
it's not gonna be your fault...
that I was there
all alone, all right?
Heh!
This better be good,
Favaro.
I was only six over par
going into the back nine.
Narcotics gave him a gun and a dog,
and then he disappeared.
Shit!
You gotta admit
the kid's got balls.
Stake out the laundry. My bet,
that's where he's headed.
Yes, sir.
Hey.
Just a second, Favaro.
What if Sam Jones is a crook?
Let's give Kuffs a couple of hours,
see what he turns up.
It might be good for all of us.
Yes, sir.
All right, Thunder.
We're looking for something illegal.
I'll let you have the honor.
[Growling]
Hey, there you go!
[Grunts]
Having fun?
Here I come.
[Laughing]
[Sighing]
That wasn't bad.
[Ringing]
Yeah?
Everything's set.
I'll meet you at the laundry.
What do you think?
Here? Anything?
- [Growling]
- Nothing.
All right.
Come on.
All right, look. Let me
just explain to you
one more time, okay?
We're looking for
something illegal.
What about
hanging clothes?
[Whining]
Wanna smell some
hanging clothes? Huh?
Come on.
What about over here?
Come on.
Can you smell anything yet?
[Whining]
[Whimpering]
[Barking]
Did you find something
back there?
[Growling]
What is it?
Oh!
What the hell is this?
Oh!
[Clicks Tongue]
Do you believe this stuff
is worth $50 million?
It doesn't even come
with a frame!
[Scoffs]
[Motor Stops]
Just getting it for you.
How are you, Sammy?
Thanks for the warning.
Sic 'em!
Come on.!
You've meddled in my business
for the last time, Mr. Kuffs.
I just figured out what
you've been up to, Sammy.
All this time, I thought
it was drugs, but no,
you're selling stolen art...
and kicking good people
out of their homes.
That's not good.
I'm gonna have to arrest
all of you now. Come on.
I don't think so.
Hold him.
What? No designated hitter?
I'm impressed!
[Grunting And Gasping]
Kane was my best friend.
We grew up together.
We had a dream.
We were gonna change
this town together.
Then you came along
and killed him.
I hate you for that.
I'm not too happy about
what he did to my brother.
Hmm.
Why don't we call it even?
Hey!
Get him off
those paintings.
[Starter Grinding]
Come on, come on, come on.
Please, not today.
Let's go!
Come on.
Honey?
Sweetheart,
I made you a list.
Another one?
You're out of everything,
even Windex.
Thanks.
[Starter Grinding]
Aah!
Why don't you take mine?
It's the chief's car.
It's half mine.
That's funny.
[Laughing]
[Starter Grinding]
See ya.
Come on, please.
[Muffled Groaning]
[Honking]
I'm thinking!
[Sighing]
I hate you, George Kuffs.
[Grunting]
[Muffled Grunting]
[Thunder Whining]
George!
[Moaning]
George!
George?
[Grunting]
[Farting]
George?
Howl!
[Howling]
[Howling]
George?
- [Both Howling]
- George!
[Howling]
George?
George?
George!
I knew I heard a dog. What?
What?
What?
Bomb!
You all right?
[Barks]
Yeah, good boy.
Oh, my God! My God!
My God! Look at the car.
Look at the car.!
It's on fire.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
We gotta go.
It's on fire.
The car's melting!
Sam's getting away.
I can't believe this.
I know where
he's going.
It's melting!
One day you'll look back on this
and have a good chuckle.
It's the chief's car!
Ooh.
Taxi!
Come on, come on.
Let's go get Sam.
What?
He was? With a dog?
Hold on a second.
This is Mr. Brown.
He said he just saw George
and another guy and a dog
getting into a cab...
in front of Wang's Laundry
just after it blew up.
Ask him what kind
of a cab George got into...
and tell him he's late
with his payment.
Oh, and ask him,
how's the dog.
Hello.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
I'm, uh, sorry
about the car, Ted.
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God...
By the way,
do you have a gun?
Of course
I don't have a gun.
I'm on suspension.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
I hate to say it,
but I don't have a gun either.
[Moans, Barks]
You weren't prepared
for this, were you?
Mmm.
[Ted]
Yeah, gimme that 12-gauge.
Two boxes of double aught.
Let me have two 9-millimeters
and a couple boxes of shells.
How many guys
are gonna be there?
At least four, and Sammy.
Give me that.44 magnum
and a Sig 226.
You think I could have
one of these 12-gauges also?
Is this gonna be
cash or charge, officers?
[Barking]
- I'll pay you back.
- [Growling]
You have no conception
of what you owe me.
Can we return these
when we're done?
Ah, I didn't think so.
Let's take it out of
the billion you owe me.
[Bell Dings]
[Barking]
Kuffs and Bukovsky just
bought a shitload of guns
over at Bradford's.
The chief waited
six months for this car.
I screwed up
big time here, Favaro.
Put out an APB for 'em.
Your money's
in the briefcase.
Can't come up here, buddy.
We're repaving.
Hi, there. Why don't you
turn around and keep
your hands on your head?
You got any rope?
Tape?
Okay, let's go.
Why don't you wait for us here?
We shouldn't be too long.
- Hey!
- Yo.
He's obviously a lot smarter
than we are.
How do you load
one of these things?
What?
How do you load
one of these...
I heard you!
You take the shells
and you put 'em in here.
When you've got in as many
as you can, you cock it back to fire.
Like this?
Shh.
It's okay.
Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Ikawa.
- Van's on me.
- Thank you.
Hey!
- Sammy, how are you?
- God must love fools.
Everyone keep their hands
where I can see 'em.
[George] All right, now I hate to
repeat myself, but you're all under arrest.
Now, come up from around the cars
and lay down on the ground or something.
- Yeah, that's good.
- That's a 12-gauge pump, boys.
It's only got three shots.
He can't get us all!
Well, now we know he can add
and he can subtract.
So, who wants to be
next here?
[Bells Tolling]
[Cries Out]
[Honking]
There's a shoot-out
on top of a parking
structure on Powell.
- They think Kuffs and Bukovsky.
- Shit. Why me?
He's in the elevator.
I'm gonna cut him off. Cover me!
Wait a minute. Wait!
You call that coverage?
You didn't wait for me.
All right,
he's gettin' away.
This time cover me,
okay?
This time, run!
Okay, go! Go!
Sure?
[Grunts]
Damn!
You don't stand a chance, guys.
Drop your weapons and
come out with your hands up.
- Jesus!
- [Groans]
How the hell did
you guys find us?
Cab company.
[Panting]
[Bottle Clattering]
[Groans]
[Sirens Wailing]
Flyin'through the air.
Super baby.!
Whoo!
Whoo.
Look at that little face.
Hello!
What beautiful eyes.
Rockette.
[Chuckling]
Well, obviously, I never
actually made it to Brazil.
Ted and the chief's wife
decided to go instead.
The chief was pretty angry
about his car, now, wasn't he?
What'd he do to Teddy?
He went, bing, bing, bing!
Yes, he did.
Yeah, I decided to
stay in San Francisco
and marry Maya.
I really loved her
all along, you know.
See, this is
our daughter, Sarah.
Say hi to the folks
right there, Sarah.
Hello-bee. Hello.
I thought you were
giving her her bath.
No, we were
waiting for you.
Oh, come on, Sarah.
Daddy's a big silly.
There she goes.
Oh, my pretty baby.
Come on. Let's go take a bath.
Let's go take a bath,
Sarah. Come on!
[Sighs Deeply]
Bah-dah-bum.
My piglet.
Are you mommy's girl?
My life!
Well, she came up
with the idea...
of me taking the high school
equivalency exam...
so I could keep
the business.
Believe it or not,
I actually passed the thing.
And then we decided
to expand.
So we borrowed
a little bit of money
from her parents...
and, uh, bought
a whole 'nother district.
Yeah, she's a clever girl.
Women.
If it weren't for them,
there'd be no civilization.
See ya!
I don't want to live without you
Oh, no
I won't walk away
I don't want to live without you
No one could
ever take your place
There's a road
Ooh, ooh
A road I've got to take
Don't ask me why
Some day
Ooh, ooh
It'll all be worth the wait
Ooh, ooh
My love
Now I'm caught in the fire
And I'm too hot to hold
But I won't leave you out
In the cold
Hey
I don't want to live without you
Oh, no I won't walk away
I don't want to live without you
No one could
ever take your place
I don't want to live without you
Oh, no I won't walk away
I don't want to live without you
No one could
ever take your place
I don't want to live without you
Nobody, nobody
I won't walk away
I don't want to live without you
No one could ever take...
