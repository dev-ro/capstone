Nathalie!
I'm coming!
Can we put ourselves
in the place of the other?
Definitely not easy
music to listen to.
- I would't play it at home.
- For sure.
You have to see it.
- Music in general?
- Yes.
It's meant to be seen,
not just heard.
"A great French writer
wanted to rest here
"to hear only the
sea and wind.
"Passerby,
respect his last wish. "
Can we go?
Because the tide's coming in.
I don't want to sleep
with Chateaubriand.
Wait up?
- Coming?
- I'll be right there.
THINGS TO COME
Several years later
Don't answer.
It's your mother.
Hello, you've reached
Heinz and Nathalie.
We're not in but you
can leave a message.
Nathalie?
Nathalie, are you there?
It's me.
I'm in such pain, Nathalie.
I can't breathe.
- What is it?
- I can't breathe.
- I took a Xanax.
- How long ago?
45 minutes.
Can I take another?
- Sure, take one now.
- It doesn't help.
It'll be fine!
I'll call the firemen.
I can't stay like this.
We can't call the firemen
for every panic attack.
You can't come?
Now? Are you crazy?
See the time?
I have to sleep.
I get up at 6.
The Radical Loser
If the reform passes,
us kids won't find work.
Already 25% uneployment!
When we finish school,
we won't find jobs!
Let's show them
we won't give up!
- You can't enter!
- You can't stop me from working!
- Majority rules in democracy!
- Let the teacher in.
- Everyone together!
- Unbelievable...
Everyone together...
Good morning.
- Can we have a debate?
- A debate?
On the reform.
To get your opinion.
I don't have to give
my opinion on politics.
But blocking the
entrance is pathetic.
Students deciding if
teachers can work?
We have to ask freshmen
if we can teach now.
They won't let
Antonia come in.
Great!
I've had enough.
- Respect different convictions!
- You have none!
You just want to graduate!
You're in school and
speak of retirement!
- Enough!
- Your talk of '68 is nonsense!
- You're selfish!
- Us, selfish!
This isn't for us,
but for our parents, for workers.
- For people that work hard all their lives!
- For our futures.
And you're not concerned?
- I'm not here to talk politics,
but to teach. - Collaborationist!
- You don't mind working until you're 67?
- I love my job. I'm in no rush.
- Teachers have no lives.
- What about people who slave away?
- Meaning people like you?
- Butt out!
- Listen to you! Unbelievable!
- Let my students enter.
Let the scabs in!
- Open your books.
- Yes, madame.
There's no time for class.
Okay, then.
Then consider this
quotation of Rousseau's:
"If there were a nation of Gods,
"it would govern itself democratically.
"A government so perfect...
"is not suited to men. "
Think it over then
we'll discuss it.
Don't misinterpret it.
Remember, Rousseau wrote
"The Social Contract",
inspiring "The Declaration of the
Rights of Man and of the Citizen".
His ideas formed the Revolution.
Fabien!
- Tutoring?
- Yes. And I wanted to say hi.
- How nice. Is all well?
- Yes.
- And you?
- Fine, very well.
I have two memories
of my senior year.
The hospital where my mom
and I waited as my dad died.
And your class, where I discovered
philosophy. I had to tell you.
I'm touched.
Thank you.
How you said to hold on, to never let go,
all your ideas and books.
It annoyed me, a lot.
But it helped me get by.
- No need. You had an iron will.
- No, it was more complicated.
I skipped classes,
got high at home.
You put pressure on me.
École Normale was your idea.
My mom had no idea what it was.
Come on, it was your calling.
It was obvious.
Your essays were excellent,
very clear.
All I did was correct spelling.
That's all.
- Is your PhD coming alone?
- No, not really.
- Since I stopped teaching, I do odd jobs.
- Writing for my Essay Collection.
Or less fun stuff.
- I do other things in my free time.
- Like what?
I'm involved in a an anarchist group.
I see my girlfriend.
I enjoy life.
More to life than philosophy.
Can you get me a few copies
of my essay on Adorno?
Sure, I'll pick some up at Cartet.
I just finished this. It's great.
- Tell me what you think.
- Thank you.
See you.
Thanks for coming by.
How did you manage today?
- It was fine.
- No problem entering the high school?
No... yes.
- As I went in, a kid looked
at me threateningly. - And?
I said: "I know who you are.
One more step and you'll regret it. "
He ran away.
- You were bluffing.
- Nope.
What was your class on?
Empiricism and rationalism.
Were they concentrated?
- Totally concentrated.
- Of course.
You terrorize them.
No, I make them responsible.
On time and attentive.
I said: "One word about
retirement and you're out. "
How many Adornos do you want?
- A dozen. Have you sold any?
- Not many.
We'll see in September.
The Foucaults are downstairs.
They still sell well.
- Nathalie?
- How are you?
- And you?
- Fine.
- Getting through these strikes?
- Don't bring it up.
What are you two
doing this summer?
If my mother lets us leave, we'll go to
Heinz place in Brittany. I can't wait.
- This is Amélie.
- Hello.
Daniel has replaced Clélia.
I don't know if you've met.
I think we spoke on the phone.
So... we want to show you how we
intend to redesign your textbook.
To discuss this new edition
before undertaking anything.
We want to maintain the
specificity of the 2004 version.
It remains an anthology
devoid of commentary
that might come between
teacher and student.
A few figures...
Which way?
Like this.
Can you break them down?
In sum, according to
qualitative analyses,
Cartet remains the first
choice of teachers.
But sales figures give our
competitors a big lead.
Excuse me.
Our aim is to strengthen its
quality as a reference book,
while striving to meet
market expectations.
Look through it at home.
in short,
our aim is to upgrade the textbook,
to humanize it.
To give it the pedagogical
makeover it needs.
We'd like to add facilitators
and product tie-ins.
Make it more attractive,
less austere.
Show her the graphic designer's
suggestions for the Essay Collection.
You're changing my collection?
- It's the most costly and least profitable
collection. - And the most prestigious.
No doubt, but we can't sit back
and watch sales plummet.
Just a proposal.
- If you don't like it...
- It's bad beyond belief.
Like an ad for M&M's.
What I've always fought against.
The original cover is classy,
but very plain.
The new one is modern,
aggressive and catchy.
- We did test.
- It's really hard to miss.
A total eye-sore!
Mrs. Chazeaux!
Mrs. Chazeaux!
Sorry, but you must pay for the books.
You'll get 50% off, of couse.
We used to get 20 copies. Now you
don't send them and we pay?
Taking the metro?
- Can I walk you?
- I'd like that.
I read your protégé's
text on Adorno.
- Brilliant, for sure.
- I agree.
But I wonder if he can
keep writing schoolbooks.
Why?
It's extremely limpid.
He keeps advocating his radical ideas.
It comes across in every line.
I prefer a text a bit rhapsodic by
someone who thinks out of the box,
- over the bland writing of marketing
fiends. - They do their job.
You know I didn't hire them.
Still in bed?
Yeah, Pandora, hide.
I bought you salmon
and sheep-milk jogurt.
I'm in a rush.
I have the kids for lunch.
Staying in bed all day?
I got you the papers.
Le Monde and Libé.
Anything worth reading?
Besides the strike,
Iranian repression, if you care.
Can't my grandchildren come visit?
I miss them.
They'd come if you left your bed.
- And filled your fridge.
- What do you think? Not bad, huh?
- Where did you get it?
- It's mine.
I never saw it before.
Did you buy clothes again?
Barbara Bui?
Are you kidding?
- With what money? Another bad check?
- I gained weight.
- You went alone?
- Inés came along. We took a taxi.
For someone depressed,
you seem fine.
I had to buy something.
- I have a role next week.
- Really?
As what?
A TV crime movie.
I play a cadaver.
Can you get my glasses?
On the shelf.
At least it won't be tiring.
Guess again.
Two hours of makeup.
Here they are.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Let's eat.
You okay?
- Who wrote the article?
- Simone something. Italian name.
- Not Simone Pozzi?
- That's it.
I know her. A repulsive Stalinist.
When we met, your mom was handing
out comie tracts. A real terror.
Okay, I was a communist.
3 years. No shame.
- Just 3 years...
- Like most intellectuals then.
- Not me.
- No, not you.
- She was even in the USSR. - So what?
I came back disenchanted.
- I read Solzhenitsyn, end of story.
- Always the last word. You never change.
We're not all clairvoyant like you.
True, your father hasn't
changed since he was 18.
"Starry sky above and
moral law within. "
- Already his credo in '68.
- Granted.
A barrel of laughs too.
It's Fabien.
- Who is it?
- Her favorite, you know?
- I have no idea.
- The son she'd have liked.
- My opposite, physically and
intellectually. - You're such idiots!
- Her former student, the writer.
- Now I see.
Quiet down!
He's coming.
- Hello.
- Hello.
You okay?
Come in.
- I won't bother you.
- It's no bother.
- I'm in a rush anyway.
- 5 minutes. Don't just stand there.
- Something wrong?
- Sorry, I look like a bum.
- I spend all night outside.
- Outside?
Hello.
Protesting against an eviction.
Have a seat.
Friends were arrested.
My girlfriend got hit.
- Nothing serious?
- Not really.
- Do you do this often?
- Sometimes.
- I got your books. They're
on the table. - Thank you.
Bon appétit.
- How are my strawberries?
- Delicious.
Here.
Do you want more?
Have a seat.
Have some strawberries.
I read your book.
- What is it?
- An incredible text on terrorism.
- You never mentioned it.
- What? Sure I did.
I didn't have the honor.
- What do you think?
- Very well written...
but it preaches
to the converted.
I don't think so.
I dislike how it confuses
radicalism and terrorism.
No, I disagree.
Here.
This is just came out in French.
- Günther Anders.
- Who's he?
A philosopher.
- Hannah Arendt's first husband.
- I'll make the coffee.
I was waiting fot it
to come back out.
Can I write on it
for your collection?
Why not?
I'll read it and tell you.
- Thanks.
- Let's see.
The Obsolescence of Man.
- What "obsolescence"?
- Johann...
Just kidding.
How do you say it in German?
Not great either.
- Pronounce it, Mom.
- Stop teasing me!
What is it?
They've ganged up.
You could have made an effort.
You were like ice.
- I don't like him much.
- What don't you like?
Expert on everything,
a real know-it-all.
You don't know him.
He fawns when he needs you,
- but walks over you when you're
in his way. - You're crazy!
The sweetest, kindest student
I've ever had.
And he's brave.
- Because he's Mr. Protestor?
Not just that.
Spare me your sarcasm.
You're jealous?
Jelaous.
Please!
Dad!
Dad!
- Chloé. What a nice suprise.
- I was nearby.
- I think you want to
say something. - Yes.
But it's not easy.
- Are you in trouble?
- No.
- I know. You're pregnant.
- Not at all.
What is it then? Tell me.
I know you're seeing someone.
- Does Mom know?
- No.
Don't worry.
I won't say.
But Johann and I
want you to choose.
Quickly, Dad.
Mom
Hello!
"Can the truth be debated?"
- Go ahead.
- I don't get it.
Why couldn't it be debated?
Really?
- What about areas where it's established?
- It's always contestable.
No one still says the Sun
revolves round the Earth.
In science,
there are established truths.
Is that the only area?
- History too.
- Exactly.
The storming of the
Bastille on July 14th, 1789,
or Nazi extermination of Jews
leave no room for debate.
Be careful. Debating truth is one thing,
contesting it another.
- When can we say truth is established?
- That's the question.
In the end, the problem is
less the existence of truth,
than criteria for establishing it.
Distinguish between the areas
where truth can be proved,
from those concerned with belief,
conviction, faith,
but not established truths.
- Like art. We can't speak
of truth in art. - Really?
We still question the genius
of Homer and Shakespeare?
- A recent movie said Shakespeare's
a sham. - It's too late.
Mozart, Proust, Van Gogh:
time decided.
There's truth in art,
established over time.
Why can't time get it wrong?
Excuse me.
Nathalie, it's me.
I turned on the gas.
I'm going to die.
I have to go. It's my mother.
She's crazy.
I have to see her.
Sorry.
Antonia, I'll call you tonight
for the next class.
Tell your classmates,
even the strikers.
- They won't come.
- Still...
I'll send you the corrections.
And read Alain's Propos.
I'll tell you which pages.
Goodbye.
How is she?
I'm her daughter.
- It's not serious.
- Thank you.
- You're her daughter?
- Yes.
Enough!
3 times this week, for nothing.
- Three times?
- Not true!
- He's lying!
- We're firemen, not doctors.
I know. I'm sorry.
I keep telling her.
Consider putting her in hospital.
Call an ambulance, but not us.
I won't go to hospital!
- I won't go!
- Sign this release.
- She said she called you. Answer.
- You know how often she calls?
Your mother is your responsibility.
I'm ice cold.
Can I have my mink?
The firemen who tended
to me was cute.
I'll put you in a rest
home for a bit.
You can't do that, Nathalie.
No choice.
I thought your visitors would help.
- You can't be a minute alone.
- Why don't you take me?
What else?
You'll sleep in my bed too?
- I have a husband.
- Yes, it's true.
- What's his name again?
- You kidding?
- No, I swear I forgot. His name?
- Forget it.
Tell me!
- His name is Heinz.
- What?
- Heinz.
- Oh, yeah... what an awful name.
Hello.
How could you marry a guy
with a name like that?
Hello, Mrs. Lavastre.
How are you today?
Thanks.
Go on in.
- Already?
- I said all I had to.
- You have two hours left. Try.
- What for?
This won't change my
grade point average.
Did Antonia choose the essay too?
Good.
That's not a problem.
Don't worry about references.
Hello!
I'm exausted. You?
What is it?
Why so glum?
Nathalie...
I must tell you.
I met someone.
Meaning?
And why tell me?
Couldn't keep it a secret?
I'm moving in with her.
What?
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm sure.
- Since when?
- A while.
- A student?
- No...
Who then?
You don't know her.
I though you'd love me forever.
I'm a goddamn idiot!
I'll always love you, Nathalie.
You know it.
Oh, come on.
Lunch is ready.
Just warm it up.
- You're not eating?
- Not here.
Shit!
Thank you.
See you later.
- Did we forget anything?
- She didn't want her books?
No, oddly enough.
We'll be back for Pandora anyway.
I didn't expect this.
- I thought she'd scream.
- She gave up.
Or worry about her cat. She doesn't care.
She didn't even ask!
Those are our birds.
We have many pets here.
Our residents appreciate them.
Hello.
This is the dining room.
Very pretty view of the countryside.
I asked for a room upstairs.
- I'll tell them to change it.
- It's not a problem. I'm fine here.
I'll come back in two days.
You can always call.
You have a phone.
You can go to the hairdresser.
Get a manicure.
If you knew how much
this place cost...
And it's 5 stars
compared to the others.
That fucking smell...
Smell of death.
Pandora! Come on!
Pandora! Come out!
- Come on, Pandora!
- Pandora!
Come on.
We have to remove the radiator.
Get inside.
It's so heavy!
Damn...
What a gift!
And with my allergies...
Go hide, dummy.
What the hell?
What a nerve!
Sorry, I'm late.
I'll lock my bike.
Another night outside?
- I'm moving out of my studio.
- Really?
To what part of Paris?
- To the mountains, in fact.
- The mountains?
My friend and I bought a farm.
- A real steal. Very remote.
- What will you do there?
- Make cheese.
- No, really?
Yes, really.
Okay, not just that.
I'm going to write too.
I can't come visit?
Of course.
As often as you like.
Can I have a puff?
I'm dying for one.
- Want a cigarette?
- No, just a puff.
I have big news as well.
Heinz and I are separating.
I'm going to divorce.
Divorce?
You seemed so...
I don't know. United.
25 years together and he
found another woman.
There you go.
Shit.
Sorry.
No worries.
I'm taking it very well.
Anyway, after 40 women
are fit for the trash.
- How can you say that? Especially you!
- It's the plain truth.
Do many women my age
leave their husbands?
- There are tons of them.
- In movies.
- You'll obviously find someone.
- Yeah, right...
Why not?
I suddenly find you naive.
Who will I start over with?
An old man? No, thanks.
Try young if you don't like old.
As if I'd settle down
with a young guy.
Not my style.
It's not that serious.
My life isn't over.
Deep down, I was prepared.
No reason to pity me. I'm lucky
to be fulfilled intellectually.
It's enough to be happy.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
What a wisdom.
My house in Brittany saddens me.
I mean...
my husband's family house.
Every vacation since our wedding.
It means so much to me.
The love I put into it.
The garden I planted,
designed from A to Z.
To think I have
to give it all up.
All my memories.
The beach where I
saw my kids grow up.
- Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
Swim.
The water's amazing.
What are you doing?
Making room.
- It's not your last time here.
- Of course it is. What do you think?
I thought you'd keep on
coming without me.
- With a kids.
- No, I don't think so.
I hope she likes flowers.
It'd be a shame to
abandon the garden.
I worked so hard on it.
- You're not overdoing it?
- You won't face up to reality!
You act like everything's the same.
What planet are you on?
Wake up!
There's no dial tone.
I meant to call the phone
company tonight.
What do I do?
No reception here.
- Did you try up on the road?
- I have no network on the road!
Pain in the ass!
Hallo. Yes, hello.
It's Nathalie Chazeaux.
I'm calling to see
how my mother is.
I don't fucking believe it!
Hallo!
Hello!
It's Nathalie Chazeaux.
I called a few seconds ago.
It's to see how my mother is.
Really?
What do you mean?
Since when?
There's nothing you can do?
But...
Yes...
I'm going back to Paris.
My mother hasn't eaten in 3 days.
There's a train in an hour.
- Can you drop me off?
- It's not a ploy to get you back?
Of course it is.
What should I do, let her die?
Hello.
Are you okay?
Why do I subscribe you to papers
if you don't read them?
I'm hungry.
They don't give me any food.
Got something for me?
Any strawberries?
I'd love strawberries.
- And oysters too.
- You're out of luck.
But I have chocolate.
The nurses complain you
won't leave your room.
- Not even for the rec room.
- Those old folk make me want to puke.
I'm expecting...
more demonstrations.
- I'm aware that people suffer.
- Who is this guy?
Are you acting dumb?
It's Sarkozy.
President of France.
He's ugly.
You preferred Chirac?
He wasn't bad.
- He made love with his boots on.
- What?
- Where did you hear that?
- Everyone knows. Except for you.
- Sorry, I'm a little late.
- No big deal.
- All well?
- Yes, and you?
Are they for me?
How beautiful.
- What's his name?
- I don't know.
What a funny cat.
It's my mother's.
Pandora.
She can't keep her. I'm allergic.
If anyone wants her, she's yours.
- What are your vacation plans?
- We are all going to my dad's, in Corsica.
He'll be away.
It'll be cool. We'll rent a car.
And you?
I'd rather not discuss it.
We'll be back in August
for our project.
A new website. Thanks to Simon.
He's a computer wiz.
- A website for what?
- Philosophy.
- How wonderful! - Don't worry.
We won't write the texts.
What we're good at is doing layout,
getting authors...
The "publishing" side.
We thought maybe
you could sponsor us.
Write on occasional text,
reread the main articles.
Maybe write editorials
on current events.
Seen from a philosophical angle,
of course.
- In fact you want to hire me.
- In a way.
What the hell?
Come on, leave me alone.
I missed the end of
the movie as it is.
- Can I walk beside you?
- You've seen me now.
You are beautiful.
Go away.
I don't feel like it.
Yes?
What?
Fell?
What do you mean she fell?
What, is she in a coma?
Huh?!
What?
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello, Father.
My daughter, Chloé.
Have a seat, please.
I want the ceremony to be here.
My mother lived nearby her whole life.
She was very fond of this church.
- She rarely came, but...
- Yes, I don't recall seeing her often.
But she was a believer.
She was raised by her grandmother.
As a child she was very frail,
always sick.
Her mother died young.
Her father was a thug.
She barely knew him.
My mother spent her life suffering
from having felt abandoned.
She didn't go to school.
It was her biggest regret.
She pushed me to go to university
and become a teacher.
She was proud her daughter
taught philosophy.
What did she do?
What was her passion?
Did she work?
She was a model.
She was very pretty.
After that, a medical rep.
She married 3 times.
My father was her second husband.
- They divorced after two years.
- Why divorce?
He was unfaithful.
She loved him to the end.
For her, he was the only one.
- Are you an only child?
- Yes, yes, uh-huh.
She has regained this warmth
in her eternal resting place.
She leaves behind her
a proud heritage...
of love,
and of hope.
What better tribute could you
have rendered to your mother
than becoming a philosophy teacher?
For we know
that doubt and questioning are
inextricably bound up with faith.
You have made this your life.
In the name of the Father,
the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, amen.
Les Ulis, next exit.
Not at all.
We got off at Villebon-sur-Yvette.
Then to the roundabout,
and take Youri Gagarine Street.
- Make up your minds.
- Turn here, Dad.
- When?
- Now!
You try!
Their thing is bullshit.
"This is what I see and
what troubles me.
"I look on all sides,
and see only darkness everywhere.
"Nature presents to me,
nothing but doubt and concern.
"If I saw nothing there
which revealed a Divinity,
"I would come to a
negative conclusion.
"If I saw everywhere
the signs of a Creator,
"I would remain peacefully in faith.
"But, seeing too much to deny
and too little to be sure,
"I am in a state to be pitied.
"I have 100 times wished
that if a God maintains nature,
"it should testify
to Him unequivocally.
"If the signs Nature
gives are deceptive,
"He should suppress them fully.
"Nature should say
everything or nothing
"so I see which cause to follow.
"But in my present state,
"ignorant of what I am
or of what I must do,
"I know neither my
condition nor my duty
"My heart inclines to know where
is the true good in order to follow it.
"Nothing would be too
dear to me for eternity. "
- Hello.
- Hello.
Let's go next door.
Daniel will join us.
You summoned me?
After having consulted
our marketing division,
we decided not to renew
the old textbook.
We prefer to start from scratch,
with a new team.
Okay.
Is that all?
No.
We also have to say that the
Essay Collection is being reviewed.
But even repackaged,
it seems iffy.
The future seems compromised.
- And the Horkheimer book?
- The contract was signed.
Through we do have doubts about an
umpteenth text on the Frankfurt school.
What's done is done.
Christelle will contact you in September
to finalize the layout.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Nathalie, I came by this morning
for the last of my things.
I did my best to
respect our agreement.
I think we misplaced
The World as Will and Representation.
If you find it,
can you put it aside?
Thanks.
Oh, man!
No way!
My Levinas books with all my notes.
Unbelievable.
And Buber too?
How could he?
Bastard!
It's too much!
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
- How are you?
- And you? Here she is!
- Safe trip?
- It was fine.
- She's heavy.
- What's her name?
- Pandora.
- Hey, Pandora!
- Full house. It's a mess.
- Excellent. Who's there?
German friends who run an
alternative publishing house.
We're finishing a book together.
I'm being unfaithful.
- Go on, I got fired.
- No way.
Your Horkheimer essay
is still coming out.
So what's your book about?
Finding a way out of
the concept of disaster.
But while refusing
political compromise.
Creating a real countervailing power,
alternative lifestyles.
Quite an agenda.
Be good or straight to the forest.
Understand, Pandora?
Don't give me
those googly eyes.
Nice music.
I'm sick of it.
Only CD that works in this car.
- Go figure.
- Who is it?
Woody Guthrie.
Political activist folk singer.
He began in the 30s.
Bob Dylan's idol.
Then a button-nosed kid,
as he kicked up his heel
Said, my Daddy works
in the iron and the steel
My Daddy makes the planes
so they fly through the sky
That's what keeps your
daddy up there so high
That's what keeps your
daddy up there so high
That's what keeps your
daddy up there so high
You ain't afraid,
well neither am I
'Cause my daddy keeps your
daddy up there so high
We listened to the same
records for 20 years.
Brahms and Schumann.
I was sick of it.
To think... my kids are gone,
my husband left me, my mom died.
I've found my freedom.
Total freedom.
I've never experienced it.
It's extraordinary.
My Dad'll bring your daddy
back home again
Don't be afraid if it
gets dark and rains
My Dad'll bring your daddy
back home again
My Dad'll bring your daddy
back home again
My Dad'll bring your daddy
back home again
Don't be afraid if it
gets dark and rains
My Dad'll bring your daddy
back home again
- It's heaven here!
- Yeah, it's not bad.
- Hello!
- So... Nathalie...
Hello.
- Thanks.
- Nathalie, this is Hugo.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- How are you doing?
- Want to see your room?
It's gorgeous!
This cat is unbearable. What a pain.
I really have to get rid of her.
- Give her away.
- To who?
An old black cat.
Obese, to boot.
- Would you take her?
- Not after that description.
Elsa, Nathalie...
and Clemens.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Fabien speaks highly of you.
- Really?
- Your husband was my teacher.
- Really?
I hope he didn't leave a bad memory.
- He traumatized some students. Not me.
- Really?
It's thanks to him I
went to study in Berlin.
At Humboldt.
I've moved away
from his ideas now.
Old-fashioned, isn't he?
- It's not him who got you
into anarchism. - No.
Why are you here?
I told you not to go out!
Come back on the double!
Pandora!
Pandora!
Where are you going, dummy?
Come back!
- Such authority! - She's never
been out. She won't survive.
Sure she will.
What about instinct?
After 10 years at my mother's feet,
she mustn't have much.
She'll be back
once she's hungry.
Our priority has been print.
But not for readers.
Come back!
Pandora!
We've always been
against authorship.
My text belong to
whoever reads them.
These are dogmas we must question.
If we give up anonymity,
it will be seen as betrayal.
It's the starting point of our review.
We can't call ourselves a collective,
then backtrack to re-establish
the idea of the author.
If we do, we lose all credibility.
Denying reality won't lead
to a new way of thinking.
We're conforming to stereotypes.
You submit to the system you denounce,
ruled by the notion of the individual.
- By signing, you don't submit?
- No, the struggle is elsewhere.
- I agree with Fabian.
- Thank you.
By not signing our name we don't
abolish the notion of author,
we draw even more
attention to ourselve'.
Meanwhile, when think to benefit from
the prestige of the anti-author position...
What do you say?
About what?
Questioning authorship.
Me?
Nothing.
Come on.
A philosophy teacher.
You know, I think I'm
too old for radicality.
Why?
I've than that before.
I've been there.
Okay.
I have changed.
But the world's
just the same...
...only worse.
Pandora!
Pandora!
Pandora!
There you are!
I don't believe it!
A mouse!
You want a compliment?
You're filthy! Yuck!
Little thug!
You'll see.
Here you are.
Punishment time!
Raymond Aron?
Damn.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Sleep well?
- Yes, and you?
- So? Did the midnight rambler come back?
- Yes, this morning.
She had the nerve to
bring me a mouse.
You see.
- Instinct...
- Yep.
I didn't know iek was
among your references.
Isn't he fishy?
I have lots of books.
I don't agree with all of them.
And the Unabomber
wrote a book?
I hope you place more
value on human life.
I want action to be
compactible with thought.
- It isn't what you teach.
- Why do you say that?
I always insisted on making
actions and thoughts compatible.
- I try to practice it myself.
- Yeah, okay.
- But only in the private sphere.
- How so?
You don't let everyday behavior
betray your values.
You don't envisage a thought system
requiring a change in your lifestyle.
Meaning?
You think demonstrations and petitions
make you a committed intellectual.
- Clear conscience, same lifestyle.
- You mean my bourgeois lifestyle?
Why not outgrow these schemas?
I think they're sterile.
Because it suits you.
Revolution is not my goal.
It's true.
Mine is more humble.
To help kids think for themselves.
We may disagree but I
thought I taught you that.
Fabian, I have to go to
Paris tomorrow morning.
Really?
I just spoke to my super.
There's a leak at my place.
Shit.
- Sure you have to go?
- Yes, unfortunately.
I'm going to bed.
- I've disappointed you.
- No, no...
- It's not the opposite?
- Not at all.
So, all's well.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
I wasn't nice, it upsets me.
I think she took it badly.
Here we are, back home.
One year later
How are you?
You're here?
- Can I hold him?
- Let me. I just got here.
- Can you wash your hands?
- Yes.
My turn.
- It seems he looks like me.
- Like you?
You crazy?
- Not at all.
- Yes, a little.
- Absolutely not.
- Yes, his chin.
What crap.
The nonsense you
have to hear!
He looks like me!
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Finally!
I thought he'd never leave.
You're so beautiful.
Those little hands...
He's yawning!
Time to go to sleep.
What's wrong?
Is it what I said
about your father?
I was joking.
Honey...
It's no big deal.
Don't cry.
Talk to me.
Give me back my baby.
"So long as we desire,
we can do without happiness.
"We expect to achieve it.
"If happiness fails to come,
hope persist,
"and illusion's charm lasts as
long as the passion causing it.
"Thus, this condition
suffices to itself,
"and the anxiety it inflicts
is a pleasure
"which supplants reality,
perhaps bettering it.
"Woe to him who has
nothing to desire!
"He loses everything he owns.
"We enjoy less what we obtain
than what we desire,
"and are happy only
before becoming so. "
Julie is recalling her former passion,
unrequited, with Saint-Preux.
She had hoped to know true bliss with him,
and this hope made her happy.
Julie could then be happy
substituting dream for reality.
"That state sufficed unto itself. "
This is the power of imagination.
It compensates for the
absence of the loved one
with a pleasure that
is purely mental,
unreal in a way,
yet nevertheless effective.
For people with a lot of imagination,
like Julie, but,
probably Rousseau as well,
phantasmagorical satisfaction
is a real comfort
that supplants, replaces,
carnal pleasure.
- Staying a few days?
- No, no, just tonight.
Hello.
How are you?
- Good, and you?
- Very good.
- How was the trip?
- Fine.
He's over there.
- Hello.
- Hey there.
- How are you?
- And you?
- I'm glad to see you.
- Me too.
- Sorry, I couldn't pick you up.
- No problem.
The farmers brought us meal.
I offered them a drink.
They wouldn't leave.
- Can I help?
- No, go get settled.
- Your room is ready.
I won't be long. - Okay.
Go!
Look, Pandora.
Remember?
You already came once.
You'll love it here.
- Can I see the monster?
- Under the bed.
It's still okay?
Adopting her is this
year's good deed.
I see.
We'll train you from scratch.
Not too close, too soon.
She'll claw you.
- We have donkeys now.
- Donkeys?
What are their names?
This is Faloud, the oldest.
- And?
- They're Java and Omega.
- None is named Cadichon?
- No.
- He's fat.
- She's in foal.
- Pregnant?
- Yes.
- Name one baby Cadichon.
- Okay, why not?
I love donkeys.
Remind me of my childhood. I lived
in a house with donkeys as a kid.
Any plans for Christmas?
Elsa and I aren't into family stuff.
Want any?
- Grass?
- Yes.
- Should I? It's not too strong?
- I don't know. Try.
Take it easy.
I don't think you'll
come back to Paris.
I like it here.
- More time to write.
- How do you get by?
We teach at university in Grenoble.
And there's schoolbooks, internet.
- Is that enough?
- For now.
It'll be harder if we have a kid.
And you?
- Met anyone?
- "encountered person"?
You're alone?
No one in your life?
No... and now that
I'm grandmother...
Seen my cat?
I mean, my ex-cat?
You work at night?
I couldn't sleep.
You okay?
- Everything is spinning.
- Shit.
I shouldn't have
let you get high.
- Mind if I stay here?
- No, of course not.
Lie down.
- Some water?
- No, I'm okay.
But talk to me.
What should I talk about?
Talk about yourself.
...of the northern
wind to you
Blue wind of
the south to you
Pure red of the
whirling flame to you
Pure white of the
silver moon to you
Pure green of the
emerald grass to you
Deep peace
Deep peace
Deep peace of the
running wave to you
Deep peace of the
flowing air to you
Deep peace of the
quiet earth to you
Deep peace
Deep peace
Deep peace
Deep peace
Deep peace
Deep peace
Nathalie?
You scared me!
- I was early. It was cold so I came in.
- The nerve of you!
I could have been
with a lover.
Can you imagine?
I swear...
Give me back my keys.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Why are you here again?
Oh, yeah, Schopenhauer.
Here.
Thanks. I'm really glad.
I missed it.
I'd ask you to stay but the
kids are coming. I'm late.
I left gifts under the tree.
Okay.
Thank you!
What are you making?
Cornish hen.
With chestnuts and
mashed potatoes.
- They're lucky.
- You bet they are.
Damn hen cost me a fortune.
Who are you spending
Christmas with?
- Your girlfriend?
- No, she's with her family in Spain.
- She didn't invite you?
- Yes, but I have too much work.
80 exams and I'm behind on
my translation of The Dawn.
Poor guy.
Spending Christmas all alone?
Don't worry about me.
I'll get a good book.
Some salami and wine
and I'll be fine.
Now that you have your Schopenhauer,
all's well.
Exactly.
You should go.
I'm in the rush.
I'm going, I'm going.
- Give my grandson a kiss.
- You can count on me.
Has anyone noticed
anything different?
- Here?
- Yes, here.
- New carpet?
- New hairdo?
You're not very sharp.
Use your heads.
I don't know.
I don't see.
- I give up.
- Pandora!
- No way!
- Pandora's gone.
Found a taker?
Pay him a lot?
- You could have told us.
- Seriously.
- We didn't even say goodbye.
- As if you cared.
- Who's the happy taker?
- Fabien, my former student.
The one in the mountains.
Oh, yeah, by the way...
Give me your plate.
For your son.
- From him.
- For Leonard?
- How nice.
- Can I see?
- You'll thank him?
- Yes.
Look.
The Mysteries of Plato.
- Not too early for philosophy?
- It's never too early!
A little.
I'll go.
I prefer you eat it hot.
I'll sing you a song.
What should I sing?
By the clear fountain
As I went for a walk
I found the water
so beautiful
I went in to bathe
I have loved you
for so long
That I will never
forget you
Under the oak trees
I dried myself off
On the highest branch
A nightingale sang
I have loved
you so long
That I will never
forget you
Sing, nightingale, sing
With your carefree heart
Your heart is full of joy
And mine is full of tears...

Edited, fixed: titler
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
My darling
I've hungered
for your touch
A long, lonely time
Time goes by
So slowly
And time can do so much
Are you...
Still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love...
To me
My love
Oh, my love
Lonely rivers flow
To the sea
To the sea
To the open arms
Of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me
Wait for me
I'll be coming home
Wait for me
My love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
My love
