<b>Hello, Mr. Lee. My name is Braithwaite.</b>
<b>Hello, Mr. Braithwaite.</b>
<b>I've come to speak to you
about a matter of great importance.</b>
<b>-Have some tea?
-Yes, indeed.</b>
<b>This is very pleasant.</b>
<b>I've come to speak to you
about a tournament of martial arts.</b>
<b>A tournament to which
you've already received an invitation.</b>
<b>Specifically, a tournament organized
by Mr. Han.</b>
<b>Han's tournament.</b>
<b>I know, I know...</b>
<b>...but we'd like you to attend
that particular tournament, Mr. Lee.</b>
<b>"We," Mr. Braithwaite?</b>
<b>It's Lahn's time.</b>
<b>Yes, of course.</b>
<b>Kick me.</b>
<b>Kick me.</b>
<b>What was that?</b>
<b>An exhibition?</b>
<b>We need emotional content.</b>
<b>Try again.</b>
<b>I said, "emotional content"...</b>
<b>...not anger!</b>
<b>Now try again with meaning!</b>
<b>That's it!</b>
<b>How did it feel to you?</b>
<b>Let me think.</b>
<b>Don't think! Feel!</b>
<b>It is like a finger pointing a way
to the moon.</b>
<b>Don't concentrate on the finger
or you will miss...</b>
<b>...all that heavenly glory.</b>
<b>Do you understand?</b>
<b>Never take your eyes off your opponent.</b>
<b>Even when you bow.</b>
<b>That's it.</b>
<b>There!</b>
<b>That's Han. That's the only film
we have on him.</b>
<b>We know that he was a member
ofyour temple. A Shaolin monk...</b>
<b>...now a renegade.</b>
<b>That's Oharra behind him.
Personal bodyguard.</b>
<b>Tough, ruthless, as you might expect,
being Han's bodyguard.</b>
<b>We got our hands on a demonstration film
of Oharra.</b>
<b>All real bricks and boards.
Nothing phony about any of it.</b>
<b>This was before he picked up
a facial scar somewhere.</b>
<b>This is where you'll be going.</b>
<b>An island fortress, really.</b>
<b>After the war...</b>
<b>...the nationality of the island
was uncertain.</b>
<b>And sometime after that, Han bought it.</b>
<b>What do you know about Han?</b>
<b>He lives like a king on that island,
totally self-sufficient.</b>
<b>All of his efforts, seemingly...</b>
<b>...are directed towards supporting
what he calls his school of martial arts.</b>
<b>Han's only contact with the outside world
is this tournament...</b>
<b>...which he holds every three years.</b>
<b>This was a stewardess, Mary King,
found floating in the harbor.</b>
<b>Nothing unusual
about a body in the harbor.</b>
<b>But this girl was last seen at a party
aboard Han's private junk.</b>
<b>They had reported her lost at sea
before the body was found.</b>
<b>We believe he selects attractive girls...</b>
<b>...methodically builds
their dependence on drugs...</b>
<b>...then sells them to an elite clientele
around the world.</b>
<b>What did the autopsy reveal
as the cause of death?</b>
<b>She did not drown.</b>
<b>She OD'd?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Cause of death was a heroin overdose.</b>
<b>I gather you still don't have enough
to bust up his operation.</b>
<b>We know everything.
We can prove nothing.</b>
<b>We want you to go in there as our agent.</b>
<b>Get us our evidence.</b>
<b>And come out in one piece
to give it to you.</b>
<b>We'll give you anything you need.</b>
<b>Electronic equipment, weapons, anything.
Drink?</b>
<b>No, thanks.</b>
<b>Guns!</b>
<b>Now, why doesn't somebody pull a .45,
and bang, settle it?</b>
<b>No. No guns.</b>
<b>Look at this map here.</b>
<b>As you know, the possession of a weapon
is a serious offense here.</b>
<b>Han's island rests partly
within our territorial waters.</b>
<b>If we were given any reason to believe
that he has any kind of arsenal...</b>
<b>...we'd move in on him.</b>
<b>Besides, Han would never allow guns
on the island, anyway.</b>
<b>He had a bad experience with them once
and he's fearful of assassination.</b>
<b>Can't really blame him.
Any bloody fool can pull a trigger.</b>
<b>I guess I won't need anything.</b>
<b>There's a radio on the island.</b>
<b>We'll be monitoring it on the chance
that you can get to it.</b>
<b>And then you'll come?</b>
<b>Someone will.</b>
<b>We aren't an agency of enforcement.</b>
<b>We function as gatherers of information.</b>
<b>Evidence upon which
interested governments can act.</b>
<b>I see.</b>
<b>If there's any trouble,
you make a phone call.</b>
<b>Oh, by the way...</b>
<b>...two months ago, we managed to place
a female operative on the island.</b>
<b>Since then, we've lost her.</b>
<b>If she's still there,
she might have something.</b>
<b>Her name is Mei Ling.</b>
<b>Are you sure you won't have one?</b>
<b>No, thanks.</b>
<b>Now the time has come
to tell you something very difficult.</b>
<b>I am happy you have decided
to go to Han's tournament.</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>The last of the tournaments was held
three years ago.</b>
<b>I was in the city with your sister...</b>
<b>...at that time.</b>
<b>I didn't know that.</b>
<b>Many of Han's men had come in
from the island.</b>
<b>They were everywhere,
bullying and arrogant.</b>
<b>We were on our way into town.</b>
<b>Stay back!</b>
<b>Run!</b>
<b>Now you know the truth.</b>
<b>When you get to the city...</b>
<b>...pay your respects to your sister
and your mother.</b>
<b>I will, old man.</b>
<b>You will not agree
with what I am going to do.</b>
<b>It is contrary to all
that you have taught me.</b>
<b>And all that Su Ling believed.</b>
<b>I must leave.</b>
<b>Please try to find a way to forgive me.</b>
<b>Double or nothing?</b>
<b>That's about $1,000 a foot, Roper!</b>
<b>Why not?</b>
<b>I'm sorry, Mr. Roper isn't in right now.
May I take a message?</b>
<b>That's a tough shot, Mr. Roper.</b>
<b>Excuse me, fellows.</b>
<b>I say you can't make it.</b>
<b>What will you bet?</b>
<b>You've got to love him.</b>
<b>Come on, Roper, it's 175 big ones
by Monday, the 15th.</b>
<b>Only 150.</b>
<b>You forget the interest.</b>
<b>Well, maybe I ought to talk to Freddie.</b>
<b>You take advantage, Roper.</b>
<b>Come on, fellows.</b>
<b>It's the dough, Roper,
or we gotta break something.</b>
<b>You got it?</b>
<b>Freddie says this is for your own good.</b>
<b>Better confirm that flight
to Hong Kong for me.</b>
<b>How much do I have left in the bank?</b>
<b>$63.43.</b>
<b>It's all yours.</b>
<b>Thanks!</b>
<b>Only, I think you'll need it.</b>
<b>You want to bet?</b>
<b>Going on a trip, are you?</b>
<b>This jig's got a passport!</b>
<b>Where are you going, jig?</b>
<b>Where's the plane ticket for?</b>
<b>Hong Kong, via Hawaii.</b>
<b>He's not going to Hawaii.</b>
<b>Well, look what we've got here!</b>
<b>Assaulting a police officer.</b>
<b>Hey, soldier, shape it up!</b>
<b>Roper! Hey, how are you, man?</b>
<b>How am l? I'm glad to see you,
that's how I am.</b>
<b>How long has it been? Five?</b>
<b>Six years, man. Not as long as it seems.</b>
<b>Yeah, I know what you mean.</b>
<b>What have you been doing since 'Nam?</b>
<b>Hanging in a little bit.</b>
<b>-All these yours, man?
-Always first class.</b>
<b>Same old Roper.</b>
<b>Come here.</b>
<b>Parsons.</b>
<b>Yeah, from New Zealand. This man's
putting quite a collection together.</b>
<b>Know him?</b>
<b>No, never saw him before.</b>
<b>What do you know about this Han cat?</b>
<b>Just rumors. I hear he likes to live big.</b>
<b>They don't live so big over there.</b>
<b>Ghettos are the same all over the world.
They stink.</b>
<b>Same old Williams.</b>
<b>What have we got here? A little action.</b>
<b>Insects. I'll lay you $50 on the big one.</b>
<b>$50 on the big one. All right?</b>
<b>I'll give you five to one.</b>
<b>Would you bet $100?</b>
<b>You're on.</b>
<b>Come on, let's end this thing quickly.</b>
<b>Hey, that's it, come on,
just get him on his back!</b>
<b>For crying out loud,
would you believe that?</b>
<b>Oh, shit!</b>
<b>Do I bother you?</b>
<b>Don't waste yourself.</b>
<b>What's your style?</b>
<b>My style?</b>
<b>You can call it the art of fighting
without fighting.</b>
<b>The art of fighting without fighting?</b>
<b>Show me some of it.</b>
<b>Later.</b>
<b>All right.</b>
<b>Don't you think we need more room?</b>
<b>Where else?</b>
<b>That island, on a beach.
We can take this boat.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Are you crazy?</b>
<b>Pull me in. Pull me in!</b>
<b>Don't try to pull yourself up...</b>
<b>...or I'll let go of the line.</b>
<b>Would you look at that?</b>
<b>A woman like that could teach you
a lot about yourself.</b>
<b>Welcome.</b>
<b>This way.</b>
<b>I'll show you to your rooms.
The banquet begins promptly at 8:00.</b>
<b>I think you'll find our little island
quite charming.</b>
<b>I hope you haven't spent all that money
you won from me yesterday.</b>
<b>I plan to win it back.</b>
<b>How?</b>
<b>You'll find out after you've lost it.</b>
<b>You seem to be very much at home here,
Mr. Roper.</b>
<b>This guy, Han,
has a great sense of hospitality.</b>
<b>And a fantastic sense of style.</b>
<b>Yeah, it's great.</b>
<b>Then why are you so apprehensive?</b>
<b>Apprehensive?</b>
<b>No, I was just wondering
whether it was okay to drink the water.</b>
<b>Mr. Roper, don't con me.</b>
<b>Want to bet?</b>
<b>No, I really don't think so. Thanks.</b>
<b>What's the matter? Are you on a diet?</b>
<b>I'd like to eat if I could find something
I could keep down.</b>
<b>I can't wait to meet our host.
I hear this is only one of his "B" parties.</b>
<b>Have you ever been
to a martial arts tournament like this?</b>
<b>Never.</b>
<b>I have a funny feeling
we're being fattened up for the kill.</b>
<b>Better keep an eye out for the referee.
Know what I mean?</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>Gentlemen, welcome!</b>
<b>You honor our island.</b>
<b>I look forward to a tournament...</b>
<b>...of truly epic proportions.</b>
<b>We are unique, gentlemen...</b>
<b>...in that we create ourselves.</b>
<b>Through long years of rigorous training,
sacrifice...</b>
<b>...denial, pain...</b>
<b>...we forge our bodies in the fire of our will.</b>
<b>But tonight, let us celebrate.</b>
<b>Gentlemen...</b>
<b>...you have our gratitude.</b>
<b>Mr. Williams!</b>
<b>Mr. Williams!</b>
<b>For me?</b>
<b>You shouldn't have.</b>
<b>But...</b>
<b>...I'll take you, darling.</b>
<b>And you.</b>
<b>And you.</b>
<b>And you.</b>
<b>Please understand, if I missed anyone...</b>
<b>...it's been a big day. I'm a little tired.</b>
<b>Of course, Mr. Williams.</b>
<b>You must conserve your strength.</b>
<b>Come in.</b>
<b>A gift, Mr. Lee.</b>
<b>If you don't see anything you like....</b>
<b>There was a girl at the feast tonight.</b>
<b>Which girl, sir?</b>
<b>The owner of this dart.</b>
<b>Yes, I know the one.</b>
<b>I'll send her to you.</b>
<b>Another fine mess you got me into.</b>
<b>Come in.</b>
<b>Well, well, one more lovely than the next.</b>
<b>What did you have in mind?</b>
<b>Pick one.</b>
<b>I already have.</b>
<b>A wise decision.</b>
<b>I want to talk to you...</b>
<b>...Mei Ling.</b>
<b>Where do you come from?</b>
<b>Braithwaite.</b>
<b>Let's be quiet.</b>
<b>Have you seen anything?</b>
<b>Nothing much. I'm kept in the palace...</b>
<b>...watched always.</b>
<b>I know nothing of Han's activities
away from the palace.</b>
<b>But I can tell you this:</b>
<b>-People disappear.
-Who?</b>
<b>The girls. Every one of them.</b>
<b>They're summoned to Han's at night,
and the next day they're gone.</b>
<b>I know I don't have much time.</b>
<b>You must attend the morning ritual
in uniform.</b>
<b>Outside.</b>
<b>Why are you not in uniform?</b>
<b>Gentlemen, let the tournament begin!</b>
<b>Bolo!</b>
<b>Good work, you made me some bread!</b>
<b>-Mr. Roper?
-I'm ready.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>I've got myself a real pigeon here.</b>
<b>Keep the action going for me, will you?</b>
<b>What do you think, Roper?</b>
<b>No sweat. Give my friend
eight to three all the way.</b>
<b>I'm finding out about myself.</b>
<b>This is the real me, definitely.</b>
<b>Do you like it here?</b>
<b>Yes. But a little lower.</b>
<b>I know. I mean here, on the island.</b>
<b>Yes, I like it here.</b>
<b>A little lower.</b>
<b>A man like you belongs here.</b>
<b>To you I'm just another pretty face.</b>
<b>Where are you going?</b>
<b>Out in the moonlight, baby.</b>
<b>It is not allowed. You must stay.</b>
<b>Good-bye.</b>
<b>A human fly!</b>
<b>It seems that one of you...</b>
<b>...was not content last night...</b>
<b>...with the hospitality...</b>
<b>...of the palace...</b>
<b>...and sought diversion...</b>
<b>...elsewhere on the island.</b>
<b>Who it was...</b>
<b>...is not important at this time.</b>
<b>What is important is that...</b>
<b>...my guards performed
their duties incompetently.</b>
<b>And now they must prove...</b>
<b>...themselves worthy to remain among us.</b>
<b>Are you shocked, Mr. Williams?</b>
<b>Only at how sloppily your man works.</b>
<b>Mr. Lee?</b>
<b>Are you ready?</b>
<b>Boards don't hit back.</b>
<b>Go!</b>
<b>Oharra!</b>
<b>Oharra's treachery has disgraced us.</b>
<b>If you want to talk about this,
I'll be in my room.</b>
<b>I got you.</b>
<b>Williams, come here! I want you to go
to Han's study as soon as possible.</b>
<b>Hey, Roper, I'll see you in half an hour.</b>
<b>-Mr. Han?
-You fought well yesterday.</b>
<b>Your style is unorthodox.</b>
<b>But effective.</b>
<b>It is not the art but the combat you enjoy.</b>
<b>The winning.</b>
<b>We are all ready to win.</b>
<b>Just as we are born knowing only life.</b>
<b>It is defeat that you must learn
to prepare for.</b>
<b>I don't waste my time with it.</b>
<b>When it comes, I won't even notice.</b>
<b>How so?</b>
<b>I'll be too busy looking good.</b>
<b>What were you looking for
when you attacked my guards?</b>
<b>It wasn't me.</b>
<b>You were the only man outside the palace.</b>
<b>I was outside, but I wasn't the only one.</b>
<b>You will tell me who else.</b>
<b>Mr. Han, suddenly I'd like
to leave your island.</b>
<b>It is not possible.</b>
<b>Bullshit, Mr. Han!</b>
<b>You come right out of a comic book!</b>
<b>Been practicing?</b>
<b>My friend, Williams,
is expecting me in my room.</b>
<b>I wanted to talk to you.</b>
<b>We will meet your friend, Williams, later.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>This is my museum.</b>
<b>It is difficult to associate these horrors...</b>
<b>...with the proud civilizations
that created them.</b>
<b>Sparta, Rome, the Knights of Europe,
the Samurai.</b>
<b>They worshipped strength...</b>
<b>...because it is strength
that makes all other values possible.</b>
<b>Nothing survives without it.</b>
<b>Who knows what delicate wonders
have died out of the world...</b>
<b>...for want of the strength to survive?</b>
<b>What's this?</b>
<b>A souvenir.</b>
<b>Up here.</b>
<b>A guillotine. No thanks.
This is the only angle I care to see it from.</b>
<b>If you please, Mr. Roper.</b>
<b>You mean you want me
to put my head on that thing?</b>
<b>An act of faith.</b>
<b>I'm a man of little faith, Mr. Han.</b>
<b>Very few people can be totally ruthless.</b>
<b>It isn't easy.</b>
<b>It takes more strength
than you might believe.</b>
<b>Now you've got eight more.</b>
<b>Then there is a point
you will not go beyond.</b>
<b>Faked out again.</b>
<b>This way.</b>
<b>Our power plant.</b>
<b>Oh, yes.</b>
<b>A lifetime of women.</b>
<b>A man's strength can be measured
by his appetites.</b>
<b>Indeed, a man's strength flows
from his appetites.</b>
<b>No, they are my daughters.</b>
<b>Your daughters?</b>
<b>I'm sorry. I thought....</b>
<b>I misunderstood. Miss Han--</b>
<b>Also, they are my most personal guard.</b>
<b>I admire your judgment.</b>
<b>Nobody is as loyal as Daddy's little girl.</b>
<b>Mr. Roper?</b>
<b>No, thanks, I'll get up myself.</b>
<b>Nice meeting you.</b>
<b>Opium!</b>
<b>We are investing in corruption, Mr. Roper.</b>
<b>The business of corruption
is like any other.</b>
<b>Provide your customers
with products they need, and...</b>
<b>...encourage that need a little bit
to stimulate your market and...</b>
<b>...soon your customers will depend on you.
I mean really need you.</b>
<b>It's the law of economics.</b>
<b>Right.</b>
<b>Here we are stimulating
quite another need.</b>
<b>You wonder why I am exposing
so much of myself?</b>
<b>I forget what I see very easily.</b>
<b>But then, why are you?</b>
<b>I'm hoping you'll join us,
represent us in the United States.</b>
<b>I'm beginning to understand
this tournament thing, the whole set-up.</b>
<b>It's a great way to recruit new talent.</b>
<b>And who are they?</b>
<b>Refuse found in waterfront bars.</b>
<b>Shanghaied?</b>
<b>Just lost, drunken men
who no longer care...</b>
<b>...where they find themselves
each morning.</b>
<b>You left some rather sizeable debts
in America.</b>
<b>Diner's Club hasn't called in my card yet.</b>
<b>There were some questions
which I was forced to ask.</b>
<b>I got no answers.</b>
<b>And you want me to join this?</b>
<b>There are certain realities.</b>
<b>I want us to have a clear understanding.</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>There's no misunderstanding between us.</b>
<b>Help me!</b>
<b>I'm only 17!</b>
<b>Help me! Please, help me!</b>
<b>Come back, please!
You have to come back, please!</b>
<b>Quiet!</b>
<b>The battle with the guards
was magnificent.</b>
<b>Your skill is extraordinary.</b>
<b>And I was going to ask you to join us.</b>
<b>My God, this came in half an hour ago!
Why didn't I....</b>
<b>Put your colonel on.</b>
<b>Well, wake him up.</b>
<b>I don't care if he's not alone!</b>
<b>Damn it all, I don't care who he's with!
You bloody well put him on the line!</b>
<b>Good morning, Mr. Roper.</b>
<b>We have been waiting for you.</b>
<b>What's going on?</b>
<b>Would you be good enough to participate
in this morning's edification?</b>
<b>Edification?</b>
<b>What are you going to do to him?</b>
<b>Not me, Mr. Roper. You.</b>
<b>Like you said...</b>
<b>...there's a point I won't go beyond.</b>
<b>I was right about you.</b>
<b>We shall strive to be worthy
of your sense of grandeur.</b>
<b>I will find someone
with whom you can fight.</b>
<b>Quick, go destroy them! Kill!</b>
<b>Kill them!</b>
<b>Kill!</b>
<b>You have offended my family...</b>
<b>...and you have offended
the Shaolin Temple.</b>
