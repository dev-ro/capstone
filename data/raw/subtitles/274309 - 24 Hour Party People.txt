(wind whistles)
ls it a bird? ls it a plane?
No, it's the latest craze
sweeping the Pennines.
To be honest, l'd rather be
sweeping the Pennines right now.
You're supposed to have
three weeks' training for this.
Granada Reports don't have
that kind of money...
..so l'm just going to literally
launch myself off this mountain.
This is very possibly the late
Tony Wilson, for Granada Reports.
Wish me luck.
Just pull the bar in
to get control back again.
Hear it flapping, it's OK.
lf it stops flapping, l'm in trouble.
Pull it in till it's flapping again.
One, two, three, go.

There's a barbed-wire fence.

Aah- Fucking hell-
Well, l'm battered,...
..l'm bruised,...
..l've done something unfortunate
to my coccyx, l'm slightly upset...
..and l'm utterly elated.
l'll definitely be doing it again.
This is Tony Wilson, a shadow of
his former self, for Granada Reports.
Back to the studio.
Take care. l'm sure l'll be in touch.
So exciting, l'd love to do it again.
- No problem.
- OK, cheerio.
(sighs)
You're, er, gonna be seeing a lot more
of that sort of thing in the film.
All of that actually did happen.
Obviously it's symbolic,
it works on both levels.
l don't wanna tell you too much,
don't wanna spoil the film,...
..er, but l'll just say ''lcarus''.
lf you don't know what l mean, OK.
But you should probably read more.

June 4th 1976. The Sex Pistols play
Manchester for the very first time.
There are only 42 people
in the audience...
..but every single one is feeding on
a power, an energy and a magic.
lnspired, they will go out
and perform wondrous deeds.
For instance, Howard Devoto, at
the front, Pete Shelley, at the back.
They organised this gig.
They're way ahead
of everyone in Manchester.
They're already the Buzzcocks.

- Too tight for you.

they cut straight between my balls.
You're not a regular shape,

- Pardon?
- For jeans.

- You've got big hips.
(laughs) l have not got big hips.
Yeah, you have.
You've got huge hips for a man.
That's fucking ridiculous...
Lindsay, l've not got big hips.
- You've got bigger hips than me.
- That's fucking bullshit.
lt's really good stuff, isn't it?
Yeah, this is good.
Where... Where'd you get it from?
Mate of mine brought it back
from his holidays.
What, Caribbean?
Rhyl. The Sun Centre in Rhyl.
Right.
Right.
l would describe it as history.
How could it be history?
There were only 42 people at the gig.
What difference does that make?
How many were at the Last Supper?
Er, 1 2.
Well, er, 1 3 including Jesus.
- Hi, Tony. Have you recovered?
- lt's not historically documented.
ln other words, not many. How many
were at the murder of Julius Caesar?
- l don't know, Tony, you tell me.
- Five. So shut up, then.
l'm Tony Wilson.
Here we are, as we are, So lt Goes.
On tonight's show l'll be talking to
Alice Cooper, live at the Apollo.
Apparently he'll be hanging a dwarf
live on stage.
But, first, two minutes
of the most important music...
..since Elvis walked into
the Sun Studios in Memphis.
The Sex Pistols and Anarchy ln The UK.

ln 1976 two or three people controlled
all the music on television.
And they didn't like punk.
So, for a year,...
..ifyou wanted to see the most
exciting bands in the world,...
..they were on a regional show
coming out ofManchester.
My show.

This guy is fantastic.

- Listen to him.
- Looks a bit... homo, with that...
Nah, man, that's part of it,
the big drop-handle moustache.
- Oh, no, l don't know about that.
- Brilliant.
# (yodels) #
Guy with the handlebar moustache,
that is Karl Denver.
This is Shaun Ryder
and that one is Paul.
Later they become the Happy Mondays
and get Karl Denver to sing with them.

We'll be hearing more
from the Happy Mondays later...
..but right now l'm getting tired
of just putting bands on television...
..so l'm about to open
a live-music venue.
lt's, er...
- lt's a bit of a dump, isn't it?
- Not Las Vegas, is it?
- Go round to the left, Tony.
- Dog shite everywhere. Disgusting.
Yeah, well, it's urban, it's exciting.
lt's exactly the place we should be.
(dogs bark)
You don't think those kids
will nick the car?
- They're not gonna nick the car.
- Are you sure?
- Right, the reason we're here...
- Margaret?
Because of the explosion of music
with New Wave,...
..there's lots of exciting
bands happening...
..and l just think that, culturally,
Manchester's slightly lagging behind.
Yeah, to get into a nightclub
you have to dress like a hairdresser.
- Yeah.
- The wife's a hairdresser.
Well, that's great...
..but some people aren't, and they've
got a right to dance and party.
- l'm Tonay.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
Sorry, this is Tony.
Tonay doesn't believe in,
er, television.
l was just saying, cos it's funny
cos, erm,... Tony's on the telly.
You know what l call television?
The idiot box.
- ldiot box.
- Yeah, there's a lot of rubbish on.
We split the door 60/40 to me.
The band, they get a crate of ale.
You can have Fridays. All right?
- OK.
- Look round while l do the till.
OK. Thank you.
Linds. Come on.
- lt stinks in here.
- Erm, there's a problem.
You never told me he was called Tony.
- Who?
- What's up?
Tony. There's two Tonys.
Yeah?
Well, that... that... that...
Straightaway that's a... that's...
Can you not see
how that's a potential problem?
He's in charge of the club, l'm in
charge of whatever it is we're doing.
There's two Tonys on equal pegging,
there's a confrontation.
- Who's Tony one, who's Tony two?
- For fuck's sake, Tony.
- We'll need some differentiation.
- Yeah, but he's not called Tony.
He's called Tonay.
You know, Don... Tonay.
lt's his fucking surname, Tone.
- ls it?
- Yeah.
lt's a bit grubby.
Yeah, l know, but we can get it
cleaned up for the nights we're in.
- Use your scrubbers to clean it up.
- That's worse.
What is worse, Tony?
Well...
Sorry to harp on about this, but that
makes him Mr Tonay and l'm just Tony.
- (laughs)
- What's wrong with that, Tony?
Well, there's a hierarchy there
straightaway: Mister.
Mr Tonay is more important than Tony.
''Hello, Mr Tonay.''
''Yes, Mister. No, Mister.''
And plain old Tony. ''Tony, me mate.''
l've got to have some credibility.
Why don't you just call him Don?
How about that?
See if he goes for that. Call him Don.
- Don...
- We're trying to set up a club.
- (dogs bark)
- What kind of music you bringing in?
Erm, sort of, er,... New Wave.
Kinda indie.
- lndian?-
- No, indie.
(spits) Don't want any of that.
Don't like that ska.
- OK.
- Don't want any of that.
A notion. l'll leave you with this:
heavy metal.
Get one of them bands in here. They
drink like the fuckin' Queen Mother.
- Leave you with that.
- Nice car, Don.
- She's thirsty.
- See you, Don-
- l think the name thing went OK.
- He heard you that time.
- l was gonna be a don.
- (car horn)
l was gonna be a Virgil till me mum
lost her bottle at the last minute.
- No, he means he was gonna be a don.
- l went to Cambridge.
What about a name for the club?
Call it Factory.
l like that. Bit Andy Warhol.
Bit LS Lowry.
l just saw a sign on the wall,
said ''Factory closing'',...
..and l thought we can have one
going ''Factory opening''.
- (# The Clash: Janie Jones)
- # And he'sjust like me and you
Mal, when you come down to me,...
..can you just make sure
you just get a glimpse of my boot?
Just... OK, if it gets on screen
l get a clothing allowance.
- OK.
- Yeah. OK.
# He's in love with Janie Jones,
whoa...
That is the Clash,
this was So lt Goes,...
..and, as it goes, so it went.
lt's all over.
lf you wanna hear good music
from now on, get off the couch...
..and go down to the Factory night
at the Russell Club every Friday.
Go forth and preach the gospel.
Good night.
# ..how he feels
# Pretty bad #
There's quite a few.
lf they've started letting them in,
that's a good crowd.
- Fucking cock-
- Wanker.
- That's original.
- l like your hair(-)
- Oh, fuck you.
- Why does he let people say that?
He doesn't care what they say
as long as they're talkin' about him.
You know that, Alan.
- Someone who likes me. Hi.
- l love you. Will you sign this?
- Yeah. What's your name?
- John.
- Oh, hello, Mark.
- Hi, Tony. All right?
Tony, l really miss your programme so
l thought, to get it back on telly...
Oi, oi. He don't want it to come back.
He wants it to be gone forever
so it can become a legend. Don't ya?
A man with a grasp of semiotics.
There's your answer, sweetheart.
- Can l get you half a lager?
- You can get me a pint.
Right, OK. Right.
- Wilson, you fucking cunt-
- That's original.
Your drink's coming.
- ls he a friend of yours?
- Yeah, he's our singer.
Out the way, Steve.
Hi, Tony Wilson. Pleased to meet you.
ls he gonna hit me?
- You're quite close to me there.
- Yeah, l know. l wanna be.
Why?
- Cos you're a cunt, mate.
- l know, l heard you the first time.
- (# You've Heard lt Before)
- # Your smile breaking my heart
# Taking some time out
# Away from the places

lt's avant-garde.
You wouldn't understand it.
lt's very poor. Very poor.
- Try and dance to that...
- lt's provocative.
Provocatively poor.
Appallingly poor.
# Oh, you've heard it before #
They're not calling you

- lt's Brian Epstein.
- George Epstein, Beatles manager.
- That's Brian Epstein, you dickhead.
- George Epstein.
- lt's fucking Brian Epstein.
- lt's Brian Martin.
lt's George Martin, you knob.
Brian Martin the producer,
George Epstein the, er,... manager.
- Come on, let's sit down.
- You're just fucking wrong.

Hello, girls- Your Uncle Don's here.
- Come on. Jump in, Tony.
- How's about a tit-wank?
- Don't be shy. Come on.
- Yes, please. ls that all right?
- On your knees and eat-
- (laughs) Careful-
Alan, where is he?
- Where's who, babe?
- Tony. l can't find him.
l think he went out... Aah-
l think he went outside with Don.
- Do you mind if l just...
- Take it all off.
l... You don't mind if l just poke it
through the side?
- (laughs)
- No-
- Well, that's what l normally do.
- l think it's too big for that.
Come on, Tony, don't be shy-
- ls that what you do at home?
- Yes.
- (gasps) Feel that. Just have a feel.
- Oh, that's nice, that, innit?
Oh, aye, yeah.

- Come on in, love- Join the party.

- lt's not how it seems, right?
- Are you comin' in, or what?
- lf you're not comin' in, fuck off.
- Leave it, that's my wife.
- Go on-
- That's my wife... Tonay?
- What you doing, Tony?
- Go on.
That's my wife.
Listen, l... l love you.
- l love you.
- (laughter)
Can you... Can you finish me off?
- God bless.
- See ya.
- Hello.
- Ah, posters, Tony.
You've got the posters?-
This is the fucking gig.
Yeah, l know.
Took ages to get the right yellow.
- The gig's over.
- l know.
That's fucking great,... actually.
Yeah, it's really nice.
lt's beautiful. But useless.
And as William Morris once said,...
..''Nothing useless
can be truly beautiful.''
- You know what?
- All right, Tone.
Yeah.
- Heather, this is Tony Wilson.
- All right, love.
You seen Lindsay?
She went off with Howard.
She, er...
She just caught me getting a blow job
off a hooker in the back of a van.
Better go and get her.
- (water runs)
- (woman laughs)
(man and woman pant)
(clears throat)
Excuse me.
(Lindsay moans)
- Hi, Tony.
- Hi.
Erm,... have you got the car keys?
- ln me bag.
- Thanks.
(moaning)
l only got a blow job.
That's full penetration.
- (louder moaning)
- See you, Howard.
See ya, Tony.
All right?
(moaning)
l definitely don't remember
this happening.
This is the real Howard Devoto.
He and Lindsay insisted we made clear
that this never happened.
But l agree with John Ford.
When you have to choose between
truth and legend, print the legend.
l thought their name was Warsaw.
You can't have a band called Warsaw.
You can't put that on a poster.
People would think
it was a holiday advert.
Joy Division:
do you know what that is, Mr Wilson?
lt's when the Nazis, er,...
picked out racially pure women...
..and, er, had sex with them.
Yeah, well, Joy Division,
that's us, eh?
- Well, it's a very Nazi name.
- So?
Yeah, but it's quite... cheery,
as well.
- You know: ''joy''.
- Yeah.
Like a... division of joy
or something.
- Joy.
- Joy... Division.
Let's all say that together.
One, two, three...
- Joy.
- Joy.
Look at that flat-bottomed valley.
lt wasn't always crazy
between me and Lindsay.
Most days we werejust
another young couple,...
..who wanted all the things
young couples want.
Nice house, nice car
and a couple ofkids.
Enjoy the walk,
cos it's just you and me.
Would you like a little Tony
and a little Lindsay walking around?
No, it'd be a nightmare.
- l like to be free.
- OK.
OK. All right, that's the last...
last word l'll say on the subject.
Two words: body clock.
OK? Body clock.
- How are you doing?
- All right?
- Hello, l'm here.
- All right, Tone?
That's us. That's us.
The majors are the status quo
and we're not, we're the anarchists.
lt's gonna be like a co-op,
we're all gonna share in the proceeds.
We pay for the costs and everything
and the rest of it is 50/50.
50 Factory,
50 per cent goes to the artist.
Alan's gonna be
head of business affairs.
lt's Red Leb, that.
Have you smelt it? Smell that.
Smell that.
l'm giving you total creative freedom.
Right?
lt's dead fucking simple.
You don't like us, you fuck off.
l don't like you, l fuck off.
l'll write you a contract saying
there's no contract in me own blood.
- l'll do it if you want.
- Not in his own blood-
- Here you are.
- l'll do it.
- You write it... in your own blood.
- No, don't give him the dirty knife.
ln the wo... ln the words of
the great prophet, ''l dares do owt.''
- Oh, it ain't legal, this.
- Come on.
- Oh, he's done it, he's done it-
- There you go. Real blood.
''l...''
''..Tony...''
How can you read that?
l'm not sure that'd stand up in court-
What more do you want? He's written
the contract in his own blood-
Martin?-
What you doing?-
(coughs) Recording...
..silence.
You're recording silence?-
Now l'm recording Tony fucking Wilson.
Erm, we want you
to produce a band for us.
Who's us?
Er, Factory Records.
Right, 50 quid an hour.
Plus l wanna be
a partner in the company.
See ya. (coughs)
- See ya.
- (coughs)
Stop, stop, stop. Stop that
horrible fucking racket, please.
What's wrong with it?
Nothing was wrong
with the drumming as such,...
..it's just that, erm,...
..people have been playing like that
for about... 20,000 years...
..and quite frankly, erm,...
it's boring the arse off me.
Now, let's just try something...
a lot simpler, OK?
Faster but slower.
There's logic there somewhere.
- (drumming)
- l know what he means.
Right, stop.
We got... We got a rattle.
We're going to have to dismantle
the whole fucking kit.
You what?
How long's that gonna fucking take?
l don't fucking know.
As long as it takes.
ls, er....
ls this still costing us
50 pounds an hour?
We're still workin', aren't we?
What l'd like...
..is to rebuild it on the roof.
On the roof?
- Yeah.
- On the actual roof of the studio?
Bloody hell.
(siren)
Start playing.
How will l know when to stop?
Don't worry about stopping. l'll send
someone out when it's time to stop.
(plays drum intro
from She's Lost Control)
Sorry.
(softly) Just remember,
Tony Wilson's money.
(# bass intro from She's Lost Control)
Right, stop, stop.
Hey.
Stop-
(shouts) Stop-
Fucking retard-
- You... You wear it very well.
- What?-
You wear it very well,
now play like a fucking musician.
Fucking prick.
- Listen to it in the car.
- lt'll sound rubbish in the car.
We've got to see what it sounds like
on a transistor radio.
(# She's Lost Control)
# Confusion in her eyes
that says it all
# She's lost control
# And she's clinging to

- That's good. You like Bowie.
- l hate fucking Bowie.
ln All The Young Dudes he sings about
how you should die when you're 25.
Do you know how old he is?
He's 30, 29, something.
He's a liar.
Look, it doesn't matter.
A lot of great artists produce
their best work when they're... older.
- You know, WB Yeats...
- l've never heard of him, mate.
Yeats is the greatest poet since
Dante. lf he'd have died at 25...
- l would have heard of him, Tony.
- Hang on.
Listen to it.
This is... This is great.
This is fucking excellent.
- Are you listening to it? lt's great.
- lt's brilliant.
lt is. lt's very good.
There's nothing else out there
that sounds like it.
- That's the best thing about it.
- lt's wonderful.
- You like it?
- l do.
l love what he's done with the drums.
Yeah?
# And how l'll never knowjust why

10,000 pounds a month.
None ofus had a clue what to do.
You know broccoli?
Broccoli, the vegetable?
Yeah.
That was, er...
That was invented by Cubby Broccoli,

- What?
Half, er,... something... a green...
Half... gr... a... a green thing.
Half a green thing that l don't know,
half a cauliflower.

You're a cunt.

Well, l... l knew that, you see.
That was something l did know.
(helicopter blades)
Timing is everything.
When we built the Hacienda,
it was too soon.
When we built the Factory office,
it was too late.
lt did, however, have a zinc roof,
which was very, very cool.
Even though you could only see it
ifyou were in a helicopter.
At last, Factory has...
a proper office.
lt's MDF.
(laughs) lt's made of MDF.
What are all these about?
How much was it?
- lt's not the materials, Hooky,...
- That's brilliant.
..you're paying for design.
Er, l didn't ask about the material,
l asked how much it was.
lt was 30 grand... but, er...
- Did you pick the shape?
- lt was what?
No, the shape...
the shape is something that...
- 30 grand?
- 30 grand?
The point is,...
if you go to any London...
- For a fucking table?
- ...any London record company...
For a fucking table?
- 30 grand for a fucking table?-
- Rob- Rob-
Are you outta your mind, you dozy...
Shall we let go of him

- No, l'm all right.
Come on- Rob-
30 grand for a fucking table,
you... cunt-
(shouts) Will you stop?-
For God's sake-
There was a problem with the Hacienda.
lt never made any money.
There were huge crowds
and a great atmosphere...
..but it was all fuelled by ecstasy,
not alcohol.
And we didn't sell E at the bar.
Although we did talk about it.
We were spending money
on the building,...
..the staff, the DJs,
the sound system...
..but most ofthe money
went to the drug dealers.
And guess what?
They didn't give the money to us.
They spent it on clothes, or cars,
or restaurants, or houses,...
..or girls, or guns.
Especially guns.
(helicopter blades)
All right, man?
(gunshots)
Drug dealers are like
any other businessmen.
They like to increase
their market share.
Oi, you little fuckin' pricks,
tell your mum l give you this-
(gunshots)
Only suppliers don't tend to
undercut each other on prices,...
..theyjust try and get rid
ofthe competition.
(police radio)
- (groans)
- (laughter)
Soon the violence spread
to the Hacienda.
All right, big fella.
- Everybody pays, even gang members.
- Give him a slap.
- (gunshot)
- He shot him, he shot him-
Now, this is bad in itself
but it's also bad for business.
When you know someone's carrying
a gun it's hard to turn them away,...
..so soon there's shootings
in the club...
..as well as on the door.
(# Mantronix: King Of The Beats)

the doorman's uniform...

- Nathan-
- Here y'are, get it off your fingers.
There was no heroin on the island.
But there was plenty ofcrack.
Every week, we sent over all the cash
we had to pay for the studio...
..and Nathan used it
for drugs instead.
When the cash ran out,
the stole the recording gear,...
..then they stole the furniture,...
..and then they sold their clothes.

''lnconsistency is my very essence''
says the wheel.
''Raise yourself up on my spokes
if you wish...
..but don't complain
when you're plunged back down.''
Let's spin the wheel.
What a load of bullshit.
We'll remove that in the editing.
Just go straight from ''Wheel of
Fortune'', cut to ''spin the wheel.''
The guy over there
playing the director,...
..that's the real Tony Wilson, OK?
The real me.
There's plenty of other real people
in the film. There's Paul Ryder...
Tony.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- Mark E Smith from the Fall.
- Are you opening this club or what?
- Mani from the Stone Roses.
- Where's Shaun?
lnspiral Carpets:
what's his name? Clint Boon.
That's one with a table.
Mike Pickering.
Dave Haslam.
And, er, Vini Reilly.
Although this scene didn't actually
make it to the final cut.
l'm sure it'll be on the DVD.
l'm in security now, Tone.
And repossession.
That's where the money is.
Are you still keeping the pub going?
Oh, yeah. You got to.
(claps) Boys-
Hi, Tony? Have a listen to this.
# You know that love
# Love will tear us apart
- # Again
- Yeah?
# You know that love
lt's an old Joy Division song
with a soul slant.
- Yeah.
- l know what it is.
l've got a big repossession number
next week. Next Tuesday.
Massive.
Whitworth Street. Hacienda.
l'm saying fuck all.
# You know that love
- Yeah.
- # Love will tear us apart
Can you tell them l've had enough?
Yeah. Whoa-
Great. Well done, lads. Fantastic.
l'll... l'll call you.
What's the crack with this spread,
Tony?
This is sophisticated food for...
Londoners.
- lt's fuckin' leaves-
- For Londoners?-
lt's stuffed vine leaves,
they're very nice.
- ls this what they eat down there?
- Broaden your horizons.
Fuckin' southern food
for southern cunts-
Roger. ls it Roger?
Very pleased to meet you.
Tony, this is Terry.
Nice to meet you.
- Can l just... see the band?
- These are the guys.
Roger Ames, London Records.
- How you doing? OK?
- No, that's Roger.
What you've done,
l think it's brilliant, and, erm...
..if you don't mind me saying,
what a table-
And there's food on it, too,
if you'd like to help yourselves.
l wouldn't fuckin' eat it
if l were you, it's rabbit food.
We like shaggin' like 'em
but we don't wanna eat like 'em.
lf music be the food of deals,
why don't we, erm, eat that?
Absolutely.
Yvette, do you wanna do the honours?
Terry, have you met Tony?
- Yeah, we said hello.
- OK, fine.
- (# Sunshine And Love)
- What's the tune called?
Nice to meet you.
We're gonna do a cover
of Silence is Golden.
Terry, Terry.
- Turn it up-
- This is brilliant.
- Turn it up-
- Turn it up-
l like that-
- This is... That...
- (music stops)
- l was really into that.
- Play some more-
Let's hear some lyrics.
You'll hear the vocals, Roger,
when we hear the offer.
That's the way we do things
at Factory.
Shaun, where you going?
l'm not eating fuckin' bunny rabbit
food, l'm going for a Kentucky.
- Are you coming?
- See you later.
- We'll get you a Kentucky.
- See you later, Tone.
All right, mate, see you later.
Yvette? Just keep an eye on them.
So, Tony, why don't we listen
to the tune while they're out?
Erm...
Hey, Tony, come on.
l do understand that Shaun can be....
a bit of a handful.
Mm, yeah. He's a genius, though.
Yeah, you're right, he is a genius.
And l've got to say,
if l owned a record label,...
..and l had signed Shaun to it,...
..then l would not be selling him on
for a fee.
(makes chicken noises)
l'm going to make you an offer.
Can l lean on this?
Erm, yes. You've got to be a bit...
lt's fine.
l'm gonna make you an offer
for the whole company.
OK.
Five million.
What do you want for that?
- What do l want?
- Yeah.
l want everything.
l want everything: the back catalogue,
this table, this food, these windows.
- OK.
- You want Factory?
Quite right.
(clears throat) OK.
We're very, very flattered, Roger,...
..terribly flattered that you think
we're worth such a princely sum,...
..however, what you're...
what l have to explain to you is...
..Factory Records
are not actually a company.
We are an experiment
in human nature.
You're labouring
under the misapprehension...
..that we actually have... a deal...
..with, er,... with our bands,...
..that we have any kind of a contract
at all.
And l'm afraid we... we don't.
Because that's the sum total
of the paperwork...
..to do with Factory Records' deal
with their various bands.
''The artists own all their own work,
the label owns nothing.''
''Our bands have the freedom.''
''To fuck off.''
Oh, yeah. Quite right.
''..the freedom to fuck off.''
(chuckles)
l don't have to deal with you at all.
Correct.
But my epitaph will be...
..that l... never literally
nor metaphorically...
..sold out.
l protected myself
from ever having to have the...
..dilemma of having to sell out...
..by having nothing to sell out.
(clears throat)
Tony, you're fucking mad.
That's a point of view.
- (# Happy Mondays: Hallelujah)
- # Hallelujah
# Hallelujah
Most ofall, l love Manchester.:
..the crumbling warehouses,
the railway arches,...
..the cheap, abundant drugs.
That's what did it in the end.:
..not the money, not the music,
not even the guns.
That is my heroic flaw.:
my excess ofcivic pride.
(Tony) Ryan-
Tony Wilson, is it true
the Hacienda is closing down?
Yes, it is.
How does it feel
now it's fucked up in your face?
Glorious. The Hacienda is dead,
it will never grow old.
Unlike your good self, Tony.
l feel like a big dandelion cock...
- What?
- Clock.
Cock or clock, it doesn't matter,
whose seed is catching the wind,...
..it's gonna fly off, land,
take root and spawn...
..dozens, thousands
of little baby dandelions,...
..like the biggest ever fuck.
And now she wants one
so l've gotta go.
Come on.
l've got the horn, Ryan.
- (horn toots)
- l've got the horn.
- Tony-
- All right, love?
- Tony-
- Hello, mate. How you doing?
Thanks for coming.
Vini- All right, mate. Go on in.
- OK, love.
- Vini... Let him in.

You couldn't just give us ten minutes,
could you?
- Fuckin' hell- l'm full of flu-
- Just ten.
(# Hallelujah continues)
- (music stops)
- (whistling, cheering)
Ladies and gentlemen,
the hour is upon us.
l'd like now to ask you to leave
in a disorderly fashion.
(whistling, cheering)
Before you do...
Before you do,...
..l want you to invade the offices,
which are over there in the corner,...
..through that door,
and as far as you can, loot them.
(whistling, applause)
Office equipment, computers,
musical equipment,...
..take it all, use it wisely,...
..let a thousand Mancunians bloom.
Good night, God bless.
(cheering)
(music resumes)
(sighs)
Morning.
All right, Tone,
how you doing, mate?
- Good, very good.
- Great, T.
l'm really sorry about what happened,
d'you know what l mean?
- lt just fuckin'...
- Don't worry about it, mate.
lt's just... you know...
This is fuckin' great, this is.
This is brilliant stuff.
Yeah, Shaun brought it back
from Barbados.
- Well done, Shaun.
- Don't mention it.
So it wasn't a complete waste of time?
No, l had a great time, what l can
remember. Know what l mean?
(whooshing)
(Tony's voice)
Tony, you did a good job.
Basically, you were right:
..Shaun is the greatest poet
since Yeats.
This is amazing.
Can l have it in writing?
lt is already written in the sinews
of history and the hearts of men.
lt's a pity you didn't sign
the Smiths...
..but you were right about
Mick Hucknall.
His music's rubbish
and he's a ginger.
Vini Reilly, by the way,...
..is way overdue a revival.
You might think about
a greatest hits.
lt's a good idea.
lt's good music to chill out to.
Yeah, you're right.
l usually am.
(whooshing)
Are you all right, there, Tony?
Yeah, l've just seen God.
- You did what?
- l've just seen God.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
What did he look like?
He looked like me.
How d'you mean?
He was the double of me.
lt's written in the Bible, isn't it?
God made man in his own image.
Yeah, but not a specific man.
No, but...
..if you'd have spoken to him,
he woulda looked like you.
But you didn't. l did.
And he looked like me.
lt's fucking top gear, man.
