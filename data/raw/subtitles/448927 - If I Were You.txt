The planet Earth has
Venus and Mars as neighbors.
Every 7, 850,000 years
and 130 days,
they align.
This is the day.
Stop it...
I have to sleep!
Claudio, eat some fruit.
Black coffee is poison!
You'll end up with
a hole in your stomach.
My cousin's neighbor's uncle
always had black coffee and...
And left home because his wife
complained about his coffee!
- Have some respect, Mr. Claudio!
- You should respect me.
In two days,
I'll be turning fifty.
- Can I invite the gang?
- What gang?
- The gang.
- I can't explain.
You'll see them
with your own eyes.
- She's going to be late.
- Do I have to wear my uniform?
Yes, but you won't
have any trouble.
The caterers
will be here at 10 a.m.
- And they'll set up.
- They'll only get in the way.
I hate having people
in my kitchen.
- Let's go, Bia.
- And I look awful in my uniform!
Don't be silly, Cida.
You look elegant.
Right.
Helena!
Be ready by 8 p.m. Today.
I don't want to be late this year.
Can I invite the gang?
Cida, take out Claudio's
gray suit, the new one,
and iron his fancy shirt.
Take out my blue dress, too.
No, not the blue one.
I wore it to Marcos' dinner.
Never mind.
Get Claudio's outfit ready.
I'll think of something.
- I have nothing to wear.
- I'm not wearing the bonnet.
Dad, are you going to get
an award this year?
- Lf I do, it's all yours!
- "Lf" you do...
Of course you'll get one.
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day.
Bia, your dad mentioned sending
you to school in Europe again.
Are you talking to me?
Your dad asked me
to talk to you
about going to school
in Europe.
What a drag, mom!
You don't appreciate
what you've got.
Not everyone can go
to school abroad, you know.
That's precisely why
I don't want to go.
- I appreciate what I've got.
- Oh, yeah?
What do you appreciate?
The gang?
Cauê.
You know when you can feel
you've found the right man?
For God's sake!
You're only fourteen.
- The right man for what?
- The right man.
The opposite of wrong,
that's all.
You're so paranoid...
- How about a kiss good-bye?
- What a drag!
- Hi, mother.
- Hello, darling!
Good morning.
I was wondering about you.
- I miss you!
- You hadn't called by 8 a.m.
- Where are you?
- In front of Bia's school.
Exactly between
the 5th and 6th lamp posts.
I have to go, mother.
Love you. Bye.
Hello!
- Good morning, Carol!
- Good morning.
Let's get to work!
Good morning!
Mauricio, it's no use:
You either have to move
or switch teams.
And you,
always on the phone...
Flavinha, cut it out!
Don't come in those outfits.
You'll give me a heart attack
before I turn 50.
Let's make money.
Keep it up.
Sérgio!
Did you drink last night?
Of course you did!
- Good morning, Claudio.
- Good morning, Cibele.
Your horoscope says you're
going to have a special day,
because of the position
the planets are in...
Save it for the clients, Cibele.
I'm not into astrology.
- How's my girl today?
- Save it for the clients.
Listen to her! Okay.
How did the art turn out?
I made one in blue,
like you said,
and another one in yellow,
for added impact.
Yellow reminds me of soup.
Forget it.
I have to have
a word with you.
Already stressed out,
early in the morning?
What's the problem?
Did Barbara hide
your video game?
Always the smart aleck.
Relax, Marcos, I'm joking!
We'll talk in a while.
I have to check on my ads.
Hi, Mr. Gilberto.
Has your grandson been born?
Not yet,
but thanks for asking.
Don't mention it.
Have a good one.
Good morning,
Father Henrique.
How might I have
a good morning,
if the chorus is singing
next Friday,
and the piece isn't ready?
The problem
is the piece, Father.
It's beautiful,
but it's a little stiff.
The children worry,
they're uncomfortable.
But it's the Ninth, Helena!
It's Beethoven.
What else would they sing?
A rap song?
It's appealing, elegant,
and economical, folks.
Straight to the point.
What do you think?
I have mixed feelings
about the background.
It seems a little dark.
I wanted something
sunnier, brighter.
- We have an alternative...
- It's okay, Marcia. Thank you.
Here's the thing: The dark
background you observed
is there for a reason.
What do I need, Arnaldo?
I need the product
to stand out.
I can't put in seagulls, cars,
people, and so on...
I need the entire product,
standing out.
Isn't it a stroke of genius?
What? Oh, of course.
It's perfect.
- Bull's-eye!
- Bull's-eye!
Seal the deal!
Carol practiced all weekend.
She's really improved.
Well, I think Gabi
is perfect for the solo.
I thought "solo"
meant one person only.
Exactly, Regina. Gabi.
Go on, honey.
Sing a nice F# for Helena.
That's because you haven't
heard Carol's solo.
- Excuse me a minute.
- So who's getting the solo?
Excuse me for just a minute.
Hello.
Hi, mom.
I'm at the school.
Between an E flat
and an F sharp.
Speaking of lingerie,
maybe we could...
Could we have
that talk now?
Good news, boy.
We scored another account.
- A small account.
- A good account,
the kind that brings in
awards and prestige.
- Large accounts bring in money.
- Junior, my boy, relax!
When we get
that lingerie account...
Forget "when we get that
lingerie account".
Things look gloomy.
Really gloomy.
- What did you mean by that?
- Just what I said.
Your father and I kept
this agency going for years...
The world was different,
and so was the economy!
We get an account
here and there,
- and we hang in there.
- Sounds good in samba lyrics.
Listen here: Between
a samba and a heart attack,
I'll take the samba.
Very romantic! Too bad this
is the age of efficiency.
Just because you have
a degree in Marketing...
What do you know
about efficiency?
I'll tell you what I know.
Efficiency, to me,
means results.
You get results
with talent and passion,
and there's no diploma
for that!
With feeling, girls.
- Heroic, imposing...
- Go, honey!
Put more feeling into it!
Carol, think of your
grandfather's death!
Excuse me. Thank you.
If that secretary of yours
isn't perfect,
- she's on the right track.
- Cibele? She's great.
You've worked overtime
with her, haven't you?
What do you mean?
I'm a married man!
But a hot blonde like her...
Go ahead, tell us.
Here's the scoop: She was
suspicious of her husband.
She thought
he was having an affair.
- And she just...
- Excuse me. Enjoy.
- Thank you.
- What's up, Marcos?
Go on, Claudio.
- What?
- The story.
Oh, the story...
I feel like I don't exist.
It's as if I didn't have
a will of my own,
as if I was only there
to balance the tension
between Claudio and Bia,
between my mother
and Claudio,
between the chorus
and home...
I feel like,
if I wasn't always there
to keep things running,
it would all fall apart.
Why don't you let it
fall apart?
Lt'll fall apart
on top of me.
You can't take care of yourself
and everything else, too.
You have to fight
for your space,
and you have to be
aggressive about it.
You have to work on
your masculine side,
so that when Claudio
works on his feminine side,
you can reach
a conjugal balance.
Do you understand?
I think I'm tired
of balancing.
That's the problem.
How was lunch?
Didn't you get indigestion?
No. Lunch was great.
You may not have noticed,
but I was having lunch
- with the guys from São Paulo...
- I know who they were.
Then you must also know
that they can offer
a reasonable sum
for the agency.
- And they did.
- And you said it isn't for sale.
It's much more advantageous
to be their local branch
than to go on as a creative but
broke Rio de Janeiro agency.
I don't want to be
their employee.
Either we do that
or we close down.
What about the awards
we're bringing home today?
The awards will make
for a better sale.
You can't do that
to our story.
Our story's beautiful.
The problem is our math.
Women were made to shop,
not to be in therapy.
Unless you're married
to Claudio.
Even I would go crazy.
Oh, mother...
What you just said
is typical male chauvinism.
I'm just defending
a woman's right to shop.
Look at this one!
Honey, look at
this red dress!
- It's beautiful!
- Wow, it really is!
It must be a fortune, though.
Don't tell me you feel bad
about using the only thing
Claudio has to offer,
which is his money.
You know the way
you always do my hair?
- Hello, darling!
- Hi!
Have you noticed
we only meet
at our husbands' events?
You'll be there
on Wednesday, right?
- Absolutely.
- Two parties in one week!
- On this side, please.
- Don't part it.
I told Marcos I didn't want
to go away for the holiday,
so as not to miss
your party.
That's sweet.
Claudio will be thrilled.
This birthday party
will be a good opportunity...
Ouch! For me to wear
my new bikini.
What do you think
of chocolate?
I love chocolate.
Too bad it's so fattening.
I mean for my hair, Helena.
You look beautiful.
Truly beautiful.
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is great!
I have a beautiful wife,
a beautiful daughter,
I love my job,
I can show you off
and bring home
all the awards I win.
Could I be any happier?
Let's go.
- What's the matter?
- Come on.
We can't just leave.
Let's go back.
- Of course we can. Let's go.
- What's going on?
I've never seen you so upset
over losing some awards!
Not just awards.
I lost an agency.
- What do you mean?
- Never mind.
Now you have to tell me.
Never mind.
Marcos wants
to sell the agency.
So what?
He can't do that.
He can. He owns over
half the shares.
So you had all these problems,
and you didn't tell me?
You would have been worried.
What could you have done?
A lot of things, Claudio.
I could have spent less,
we didn't have to go to Aspen...
That would have made all
the difference in the world!
Aspen...
I'll work this out,
like I always do.
Like you always do,
without remembering
that I exist to help you.
And how would
you have helped?
By going to the beauty parlor?
Shopping at the mall?
Conducting
a children's chorus?
Forget it.
I didn't mean that.
But you said it.
Let's leave it at this.
Jesus...
I have better things to do
than taking this from you.
Do you think it's easy to take
care of a house, a family?
Do you think it's easy
to support a house, a family,
a shared agency?
At least you have
Cibele to help you.
- Don't start on Cibele now!
- "But Cibele is beautiful,"
"Cibele is sensational,
Cibele is indispensable."
I'm not going to spend
all night fighting again
because of your silly jealousy.
I have to work tomorrow.
- "Silly"?
- Don't give me that.
Everything that has to do
with me is silly.
Only you and
your work matter.
I'm just a silly woman.
Stop pitying yourself.
You sound like your mother.
Oh, yes. Cibele's mother
must be wonderful.
- What is it, mom?
- Oh, darling...
I can't talk.
I'm in the middle of an argument,
right between two mothers.
You can finish this argument
yourself. I'm going to bed.
You don't want
to face our problems,
just like you don't have
the guts to take on Marcos
- and fight for the agency.
- I'm rude and cowardly.
Anything else?
Let's leave it at this.
No!
You're going to finish.
Or do you want me to sign
a "loser" declaration?
I'm the loser,
with my empty life,
my beauty parlor, gym,
mall, and children's chorus.
Isn't that what you think?
Therapy is making you crazy
and pitting you against me.
Oh, so I'm crazy,
good for nothing,
and I pity myself.
Anything else?
Let's leave it at this.
I don't know why you didn't
leave me during our 1995 crisis.
Since we're testing
our memories,
why didn't you leave me
when Bia was born
and all you cared
about was her?
- You wouldn't even look at me!
- You've never been a mother.
I'd like to see you
in my place.
I'd like to see you
in my place.
- All you think of is you.
- All you think of is you.
- That's the problem.
- That's the problem.
- Lf I were you...
- If I were you...
- What?
- What?
- Again?
- Again?
They say something happens
when two people say
something at the same time.
Is it good luck
or bad luck?
Beats me.
- I hope it's good luck.
- I hope it's good luck.
- I hope so.
- I hope so.
- Good night.
- Good night.
What's going on?
What kind of a joke is this?
I'm crazy...
Claudio... Claudio!
Claudio...
- Claudio!!!
- What is it, Helena?
What the...
Go on in.
What the hell?
Look at this!
Jesus!
- Hold on, hold on.
- No, no.
- Keep away!
- Stay calm. Stay calm!
I don't want this!
I don't understand this.
Look.
- What's going on?
- Hold on.
- No!
- Helena!
- Claudio! Hold on.
- Keep away!
- Stay calm, Helena.
- I can't.
Keep away. Shoo!
- Shoo! Keep away!
- Let's talk about this.
- Shoo!
- This isn't happening.
Honey... Helena...
Sweetie...
Helena, wake up.
Wake up.
- What? Where?
- Thank God.
I thought I was dead.
Jesus Christ...
What's going on?
Claudio, what's going on?
You said "l".
Who did you mean?
I don't know anymore.
- This must be a dream.
- Whose dream? Yours or mine?
I... It's a dream.
My God,
we're being punished.
What have we done
to deserve this?
Hey! What have we done?
Tell us!
- This is an illusion.
- It can't be true.
This isn't happening.
We think it is,
but it isn't. Get it?
Daddy, did something
happen to you?
- To me?
- No, mom, to dad.
To... Dad? To dad.
No, honey, everything is fine
with mommy and daddy.
Mom and dad are fine.
Go get changed.
I was listening to Blink
really loud,
and I thought
I heard you scream.
No, no one screamed.
Daddy, mommy, daddy...
Everything's fine.
Go get changed, okay?
Go on.
Go listen to Blink.
She called me "mom"!
That is not an illusion.
- So what are we going to do?
- I... We have to get help.
- What kind of help?
- I don't know!
A lawyer, a doctor,
the police...
My shrink, I don't know!
Mother!
No! The shrink.
Dr. Nestor, I'm sorry
to bother you.
- This is Helena...
- He won't be able to help.
This is Claudio,
Helena's husband.
I have to go to work!
Anyway, we really need
to talk to you, dr. Nestor.
Please, it's urgent.
I can't pick women's clothes.
What am I going to do?
Why so many shoes?
You've only got two feet.
You need something that's...
Yes, ton sur ton.
Perfect. Take a look.
Don't forget to put on
a discreet shade of lipstick.
Call me in to help you.
Lipstick...
That's a good one.
Go on.
- Jesus Christ...
- Hold on!
- Go down normally.
- Normally? Are you crazy?
You just have
to stand properly.
- Claudio...
- Be quiet, Helena!
- Hold this for me.
- So much stuff...
- Like this. Go down normally.
- Relax, I'm going.
- Walk properly, Claudio.
- In these heels?
Just do what I do.
Pay attention. Normally.
Just normal posture.
Step down firmly.
What are you laughing at?
I look ridiculous
walking like that!
Don't do this.
Please cooperate.
- Good morning, Cida.
- Good morning.
Bia, hurry up or you'll
be late for school.
Black coffee, Mrs. Helena?
Helena isn't herself
today, Cida.
- Give me some papaya.
- Yes, please.
You guys are funny today.
- Mom's reading the paper.
- Oh, my paper.
Could you hand it to me?
- Dad, did you win my award?
- No.
No, your father...
I promise I'll win one
for you next year, okay?
Jesus Christ, this is awful!
Hold on, honey.
Have you spoken to dad?
- What about?
- About sending me to Europe.
You don't want
to go to Europe?
Bia, mommy spoke
to daddy yesterday,
and I said I'd think
about it, right?
- You did?
- I did.
- Dad, I have to talk to you.
- Great. Let's go outside.
I need to talk to you
about something, too.
Mrs. Helena... The uniform
is worse than I thought.
So what?
- What should I wear?
- Wear whatever you like.
Your mom told me you have
a new boyfriend.
But we're having a very
complicated day today, okay?
You really don't want
to kill me?
What a crazy idea, Bia!
I have the best dad,
and I didn't know it!
Okay.
You're just like Ozzy Osbourne,
only you don't play rock.
Ozzy Osbourne...
Maybe someday.
Helena, what were
you talking about?
Just girl talk.
She's going to think
her father's gay!
Where are you going?
I'm going to miss
1 st period, mom.
No, honey. Today we're
going in your f...
- We're going in my car, honey.
- And you're letting mom drive?
Yeah.
I think it's time your father
stopped being selfish
and let your mother be a part
of his life... of my life.
Okay.
Come on, honey.
Which way do I go?
Did you forget the way?
You know, honey, mommy has
a lot on her mind:
The beauty parlor, the gym,
the mall, grocery shopping...
Take the beach.
It's better.
I can't be late for work.
After all, it's my only
reason for living.
I understand.
After all, if you didn't
work so hard,
we wouldn't have the great
life that we have, right?
Don't mention it.
But I would never
have made it this far
without you to support
and take care of me
all this time, right?
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.
Is this a practical joke?
Bye, honey.
Bye, sweetheart.
Have a good day.
Who's that guy
talking to Bia?
Drive over me!
For God's sake, don't pick
a fight in traffic.
I don't want to get
punched in the face.
Relax.
What's the problem?
Relax!
- You're making me nervous.
- How do you think I feel?
Don't do that.
Don't do that!
Get that car
out of the way!
Let me try to explain.
In certain marriages,
couples develop
this kind of disorder.
It's a complicated process
of finding one's own identity.
There comes a moment when
things get so mixed up
and so complex that we can't
tell who's who, what's what,
or who thinks what.
Have I made myself clear?
Yes, you have, but I don't
think you understand.
I'm really Helena.
Do you understand?
I think our time
is up for today.
We have to delve more
deeply into this matter.
We'll need to meet every day,
with one particular detail.
- Yes?
- I need to see both of you.
Both of us?
Honey... Both of us.
Imagine what your mom will say
when she realizes her daughter
has become an unrefined
guy like me!
By the way, you should
be careful how you walk.
You have to
behave properly.
You look really strange
when you walk.
I've never walked
in heels before.
It's easy. Just stand up straight
and try to balance yourself.
- Find your center.
- My center?
- You'll be fine. It's simple.
- Okay. I'll try to remember.
And you try not to move
your hips when you walk.
- As if...
- And tighten your wrist.
- Holy cow!
- What's wrong?
Something's bothering me
"down there". So unpleasant!
- What are you doing?
- Be quiet!
- For God's sake...
- Hold still.
No, don't...
- There's the car. The guy...
- Hold still.
Feels better.
Hand me my cell phone, Helena.
- My cell phone.
- Here.
- Here's what we'll do...
- Watch the road.
- Be quiet, Helena.
- Pay attention.
- Now talk to Cibele.
- What?
Cancel all my appointments.
- I have to do that?
- Of course.
Hello. Cibele?
It's Hel...
Just a moment.
Get it for me.
- Hi, Cibele, is Marcos there?
- Hi, Vivinha.
I'm sorry, mom. I don't know
why I called you Vivinha.
I can't really talk now.
I'm driving.
Marcos, it's Claudio.
Something came up,
- and I can't make it in.
- Hold on, mother.
- Talk to her.
- He's nervous!
- Let me talk to him.
- He's pissed off.
- Hello.
- Hi, Marcos, it's Helena.
No, your daughter's fine.
- I just have to...
- He had a...
- No... Jesus!
- What?
- I have to go now, mother.
- Hold on. Okay.
- I mean Vivinha.
- I'm coming. I'll drop him off.
- We'll talk later.
- We'll be there. See you soon.
Are you crazy?
You said you'd be there.
Helena, the lingerie
client just got there.
She's waiting for me,
or rather, for you.
Not in this lifetime.
Helena, losing this campaign
is not an option.
Only if you go to
the chorus rehearsal.
See what you make me do?
- Did you understand everything?
- Yeah.
Make the kids rehearse
the piece several times.
With feeling, okay.
Go on!
- All right, I'm going.
- She's already here.
I know. Relax.
Hello.
Jesus Christ...
For the last time:
Be careful with those two.
- They're crazy.
- I'm used to crazy.
Go on.
- Go on, Helena.
- I'm going.
Walk like a man!
- Relax.
- C'mon!
Relax.
Claudio,
don't make me nervous.
What happened? She's been
waiting for almost an hour.
Marcos called your house.
What happened?
The queen's been here for
more than half an hour.
Let's go, for God's sake!
You've never left
a client waiting.
- Let's go.
- This is unacceptable.
- Take it easy, guys.
- Let's go.
Relax.
Hello.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Traffic was terrible.
Claudio, here's Tereza.
Oh, Jesus... I'm so sorry.
Things are hectic.
How are you?
With all this running around,
we end up... Don't mind me.
I don't mind waiting, as long
as the material is worth it.
And it had better
be worth it.
- Shall we start?
- The sooner, the better.
I have an appointment
at one of our branches.
You'll be there in time.
Traffic isn't that bad.
It's in Paris.
Beautiful city.
You should see it in Fall.
Hello, Father.
- Your blessing.
- God bless you.
This is hard.
The campaign
is very appropriate,
because it's based
on the concept of...
On the erotic appeal,
or rather...
Jesus Christ!
On banalizing
women's way of thinking.
I mean, actually...
Apparently, women like
to get beat up.
Nelson Rodrigues!
Merely a quote.
I'd like to point out another
aspect of the campaign,
which is...
the impact it will have,
the shock, the scandal
it will cause,
and we know nothing sells
like a good scandal, right?
Sell the chares.
Hey there!
Good morning, miss.
Hi, cuties.
How's it going?
Did you dream of Tom Cruise?
Everything's great.
How's it hangin', my boy?
Hello. Good morning.
Have you decided
who's getting the solo?
Regina and Marília,
of course.
- What?
- Never mind.
Let's get this ball rolling.
Follow the yellow brick road!
Okay. Since I was so lucky
as to meet two great moms,
why don't you help me
get to my classroom?
You don't know where
the classroom is?
Of course I do, but I went out
with my husband last night.
When I drink a little extra,
my memory gets a little worse.
Here we are.
Wonderful. Wonderful.
Provocative, isn't it?
Very sexy.
Excellent.
I'd like to hear
Claudio's opinion.
- Mine?
- Yes, yours.
You came up with the campaign.
I'd like your opinion.
Well, it...
It's interesting,
because it shows women as...
Women are sort of...
Vulgar. That's it.
I think that does it.
Claudio is playing
the devil's advocate today.
This campaign is very
important to him.
Exactly. He worked on
this concept for weeks.
On what concept?
"Vulgar"?
Tereza... Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Tereza, wait!
Are you going to waste
more of my time?
Men. Men...
They... We have this habit
of thinking we know women.
But it isn't easy to
understand how women feel
without feeling
what women feel.
That's the first thing you say
that makes any sense today.
That's because, I assure you,
I understand
what goes on
in a woman's mind.
Tereza, let me have
another chance.
Okay.
You have until Friday to
show me a new ad campaign.
Friday?
Friday...
That's the day my...
My wife's chorus
is performing.
Okay, girls.
So...
Follow me.
One, two, three, go!
Hold on, people.
Hold on!
Miss, you forgot
to give the pitch.
You're doing this
on purpose right?
You want to sink the agency
and ruin the sale.
Putting off a campaign
like this one because
of your wife's little chorus!
You must be kidding.
Her "little chorus" is
much more important to me
than the agency
must be to you.
At least I didn't
put it up for sale.
Well, if you can get
this campaign by Friday,
I won't sell the agency.
Good enough?
Claudio, if you allow me,
I'm not going to pass you
any calls or
let anyone in here.
I think you need
to relax a little.
And how do I relax?
Well, first I'm going to
put on your favorite song.
Cibele, could you please
leave me alone
for just a little while
so I can think of what
my favorite song is?
Then I'll get you
that tea you love.
- Hello.
- Claudio, help me out here.
If I jump out the window,
who dies? Me or you?
This way, please.
So how was it with Tereza?
What did she think?
Good afternoon,
Mr. Claudio, Mrs. Helena.
Good afternoon.
What did she think
of the campaign?
- The same drinks as usual?
- Same as usual.
First you have to explain
how you pee with this thing
- before I wet myself.
- It's simple.
Aim carefully so you
don't wet the bathroom,
then shake a little.
That's all.
- I don't have good aim.
- Go on.
I really have to go.
I'm sorry.
I really have to pee...
How does this work?
Okay.
I can't hold it in.
I really have to go!
It really is much
more practical
to pee standing up.
Just aim.
Just aim.
I knew you guys
didn't wash your hands.
Pig. I knew it.
Truly amazing.
- Did you pee on my linen pants?
- Lower your voice!
I didn't quite get
the shaking thing.
Just tell me what Tereza
thought of the campaign.
Good thing we switched bodies,
because I think you'd kill me.
An iced tea, Mrs. Helena.
Your scotch, Mr. Claudio.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
Thank you, Paulo.
Go ahead. I'm ready.
That campaign
was vulgar, Claudio.
- Is that what Tereza told you?
- No. That's what I told her.
She hated it, too.
What? Do you mean to tell me
you ruined the whole deal?
But she gave me until Friday to
come up with a new campaign.
I gained her trust.
You're going to come up
with a new campaign?
No, silly. You're going to
come up with a new campaign.
You're going
to get the account.
Then Marcos won't sell
the agency anymore.
I think the outcome
was quite positive,
- wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.
How can I do that and
rehearse with the chorus?
How did it go?
Was anyone suspicious?
No one.
I behaved like a lady.
What about the kids?
Did they sing well?
They sucked.
Don't talk that way
about my students.
And don't drink so much.
You'll bust my liver.
You bust my campaign,
and I have to go dry?
Don't be rude.
This can't go on.
We have to switch back.
Only if they've invented
a body transplant.
Let's ask my doctor.
Didn't we agree not
to tell anybody else?
But I trust her.
We went to school together.
Didn't Helena
come with you?
Claudio's parking the car.
- Who?
- Claudio.
I'm Helena.
I wouldn't come to you
with something this serious
if we hadn't been friends
for more than 30 years.
This is psychological, Claudio.
It doesn't happen.
There isn't a case in history.
If it doesn't happen,
how come I know
you were in love with Dudu
in the third grade?
Why did Helena
tell you that story?
Like I remember the night
you decided to have sex
with Rogério
for the first time.
And I'll never
forget that party
where you had nine
rum and cokes, remember?
You decided you liked girls
and kissed Rogério's sister
in the bathroom.
I'm going to kill Helena.
How can I explain?
Cris!
I know I'm hot and sexy
and I know you see me
and want me
I'm a beast with sexy skin
be careful, boy,
I'm dangerous
there's sweet poison
in my mouth
there's a demon
in my chest
there's a knife
in the twinkle of my eyes
I'm going to make you crazy
really crazy
really crazy
inside me
Remember?
Nice.
Have the girls decided
what we're going to do?
If this can happen,
there is a Santa Claus!
Everything is normal.
The sex chromatin
is correct.
She has the XX,
you have the XY.
Both of you, whoever you are,
are in great health.
And what do you think
we could do?
As a doctor,
I honestly don't know.
Jesus Christ...
But I was thinking...
- Aren't you curious?
- Curious?
Don't you want to know what
sex with a woman is like?
What? No way!
My life is messed up
enough as it is.
I can't believe you'd
pass up this opportunity.
Your husband is
in that hot body.
Take him to a motel
right now.
Can you imagine?
That would be wild.
Tomorrow, hopefully,
we'll have switched back,
I'll go to the agency
to work on the campaign,
and you'll go fix that piece
with your chorus.
Tomorrow's your birthday.
- The party!
- What about it?
- We have to call it off.
- Of course not.
What will I tell people?
Not to mention the caterers.
What is it?
- What?
- Just be quiet.
Claudio, what's going on?
Hold on.
What's the matter?
You scared me, mom!
Would you mind
introducing me?
Mom, this is Cauê.
Cauê, my mom.
I thought you'd be home
later today.
Can you tell me what you're
doing alone with this punk?
I thought you said
your mom was cool.
Relax, honey.
Don't exaggerate.
The kids are just
watching TV.
No big deal!
So you're the famous Cauê?
Yo!
So cute!
- Dad!
- What, honey?
I think you'd better go, Cauê.
Yes. I'll drive him.
- You don't have to.
- I insist.
Okay.
Cauê...
I know your type, kid.
Bia isn't even 15 yet,
so you think twice where
you want to put your dick,
or you'll end up losing it.
Understand?
I understand.
I'm going to start a novena
to Our Lady of Mercy
- asking her to switch us back.
- Are you kidding?
I can't take one more day,
let alone nine!
If this was a test,
we've learned what
we were supposed to learn.
I just hope we don't need
good grades to pass.
Claudio?
Again?
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday to you, too.
After all,
you've got my wrinkles now.
Wait just a minute.
I got this for you.
We did.
Stop it, Helena.
Don't tickle me.
- The big 5-0!
- Stop it, Helena.
- You're getting old.
- Nice shoes.
- Like them?
- Yeah.
Too bad I can't wear them.
Especially in our situation.
It wouldn't be fitting.
What's this for?
That's too much!
Don't make me waste it.
It isn't too much.
Why so much? I'm going
to be all gooey.
You'll be nice and soft.
Every woman likes that.
Contrary to how it may seem,
I'm not a woman.
But you're in a woman's body.
Go on. Circular motions.
- Don't leave me like this.
- You spread it. Start learning.
I like taking care
of myself, okay?
Funny. Claudio...
How would you like it
if I waxed my back?
I think you should
stop kidding around.
- I'm just saying...
- Stop kidding around,
or I'll stuff my face
with chocolate.
Okay, you win.
Ouch!
Cida, what are you wearing?
I knew you'd like it.
Cida, for heaven's sake!
Didn't Helena tell you
to wear your uniform?
Hurry up, people
will be here soon.
What a nerve!
You're so stubborn!
Hi, m... Vivian.
- How are you?
- Happy birthday.
I'll get you a little
something later.
Where's Helena?
She's forgotten her mother,
doesn't even return my calls.
Helena!
Vivian, she's not having
a very good day.
- Lf I were you, I'd...
- Fortunately,
you're you, and I'm me.
Helena!
Honey...
- Hi, mom.
- Hi, grandma.
Bia, come give
grandma a kiss.
- Bye, grandma.
- Bye.
You always have to arrive
before everyone else.
You should be
grateful I came
to your ill-mannered
husband's birthday.
- Is this piano in tune?
- You're the ill-mannered one,
always rude to my husband,
a man who loves me,
who does everything for me,
including putting up with
your unpleasant company
on his birthday.
Maria Helena, that isn't
how I raised you.
What's this?
How can you allow your maid
to dress like that?
How dreadful!
I told you so.
Claudio, I was thinking
about the campaign.
- I'm going to get a drink.
- Go ahead.
I think you're right to see it
from a woman's point of view.
- But don't get too feminine.
- What's the matter?
Afraid you'll like
my feminine side?
I'm a man, you know that.
If you want, ask Barbara.
No way. I'm a man.
But seriously, Claudio,
this thing of working at home
- in the middle of a crisis...
- Will you excuse me a minute?
Marcos, that woman
is into me.
I'm going to seduce her.
- I see you had an argument.
- It's none of your business.
I'm sorry.
I forget how hard it is
to be nice to you.
Apparently your wife
came to the same conclusion.
My daughter has never
treated me this way.
- She's really on edge.
- It's your fault.
It's a serious problem
I'm having at the agency.
What kind of blunder
did you make?
It wasn't a blunder.
It's serious.
- That's why she's like that.
- She's worried about me.
He was drunk as a skunk
in front of the hotel.
He said he wanted
a woman that night,
but he was so drunk...
So the sales dropped
and they lost the campaign
in two weeks.
Were you telling the joke
about the inflatable woman?
- Yeah, I was.
- Go ahead. That's a good one.
- Go ahead.
- Anyway, the guy was there...
Hold on, Marcos.
You can't tell a joke.
I'll tell it.
So the drunk calls
the reception desk:
"I'd like a woman,"
and so on.
You were going through
all these problems,
and never considered
asking me for help?
You hate me, remember?
It's so fun to badmouth
sons-in-law.
It's amusing.
Okay, I admit it:
I would have preferred it
if you'd gone to Sorbonne,
but, deep down,
I've always liked you.
But don't tell anyone, okay?
She farted,
turned three somersaults,
and flew out the window.
The breath analyzer!
Do you know the one about
the blonde with a flat tire?
- She got out of the car...
- That's a good one.
Excuse me.
I know that one.
The blonde gets a flat tire
and gets out of the car.
- Are you guys okay?
- Stay a little with your mom.
What?
Please.
Stay with your mom
a little while, please.
Okay.
You know I hate your husband,
but I have to admit
he seems like
a different person.
I can imagine.
Juliana Paes,
without a doubt.
You must be kidding.
Gisele Bündchen anytime.
Too thin.
I like flesh.
- Luma de Oliveira.
- Good one.
One thing depends
on the other.
What good is quantity
without quality?
Are you talking about men
or grocery shopping?
I agree with Debora.
Marcos and I haven't
had sex in months.
You know that glass of water?
It's much more interesting.
Claudio's right.
This is silly.
Let's talk about real women,
women we know.
From our circle.
Have you seen the new girl
in accounting?
What a hottie!
But the hottest woman
there is Cibele.
- Cibele's definitely the hottest.
- Wait a minute!
Claudio keeps that one
all to himself.
You animal!
Clever boy!
You stud!
Helena, is Claudio more
like a glass of water
or vodka with tequila?
Claudio?
He's a whole lot of tequila.
Although, sometimes,
he's a little selfish.
Selfishness isn't
a flaw in men.
It comes with the package.
I don't know whether
to avoid another sweet
or schedule another
liposuction.
Okay, who knows this joke?
How do you entertain a woman
for a long time?
I don't know. Tell us.
Just write "TURN" on the front
and back of a piece of paper.
I love that one!
"TURN"! Get it?
That's great.
Marcos, have you noticed
that Claudio's got a different
kind of feminine thing going?
It's Helena.
Have you noticed that couples
start acting alike after a while?
I'm talking about
his feminine side, you know?
I think it's cool.
It's cool to let out
your feminine side.
Helena must be loving it.
Beautiful.
Beautiful... Beautiful.
The water's great.
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you
happy birthday, dear Claudio,
happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, Claudio!
Happy birthday!
I can't believe
no one was onto us.
At least there's one
good thing in all this.
I've never been so sure
of my sexuality.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
That's funny, isn't it?
When we love someone,
we love them inside and out.
The craziest thing is
that I love another woman,
and so I love my own body
as if it were another's.
Don't start with me.
I've never liked
male bodies.
Claudio,
since you have my body,
learn how it works.
See this nightgown?
It's comfortable,
makes me look thin,
and you love it.
Put it on.
This isn't so bad.
I miss it.
What are we going
to do tomorrow?
I was thinking about that.
I think we have to work
with the chorus first.
Then we'll work on
the campaign together.
Together?
- Together, of course.
- But...
We're in this together now.
No, not that.
I can't, Claudio.
Relax, Helena.
Listen, let's forget
what's on the outside
and think about
the inside, okay?
But I have to be relaxed.
I have to be relaxed!
I don't see how you
can think of that
when we've got this problem,
this situation.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
experience,
like seeing the Earth
from the moon, honey.
Please, Claudio.
- I can't do this.
- Relax.
- Will you listen...
- Relax.
You're smothering me!
- Please! I have a headache.
- Helena!
I have a headache, Claudio.
I don't know how
you can think of that.
- Fuck!
- Watch your language.
I'm here to help
with the campaign.
Since when are you part
of the creative team?
Since your husband began
to screw our campaigns
in front of our clients.
Marcos, I'd rather
work by myself.
- Time is short.
- All the more reason.
You go ahead to the rehearsal,
we'll talk over the phone.
- What if it doesn't work?
- I'm going to miss 1 st period.
Relax, honey,
we're on our way.
Since when do you let Helena
drive your toy?
Let her play a little.
Let's get to work.
So, what have you
got to show me?
Would you excuse
me a minute?
Cida!
- Cida!
- What is it now, Mr. Claudio?
You're letting
the house go, Cida.
That shelf, in the office,
is all dust, girl!
And there's another thing.
I've already asked you,
for God's sake:
This Indian elephant's tail
has to face the northwest.
Since when do you care?
Do you want us to have
bad luck, is that it?
Having a man
in the house is hell!
I know exactly
what's going on here.
- What?
- You don't fool me.
Do you think I'm
some kind of idiot?
I've been onto you since the
other day, but after yesterday,
I know exactly
what's going on.
What are you
talking about?
Don't play dumb, Claudio.
Neither you nor Helena have
been acting the way you should.
And I know why.
- You do?
- I do.
So tell me.
We're so confused...
You guys don't want me
to sell the agency,
and you're acting this way so
people will feel sorry for you.
Amazing!
I really can't keep
anything from you.
Wow! You're quick.
You didn't even tell me what
was going on with the agency.
I didn't have time, mom.
Tomorrow there's
the chorus performance...
You should forget
that chorus for a while
and pay more attention
to your husband,
who, by the way,
has a heart of gold,
especially now that
he needs you so much.
Speaking of which, I was trying
to think of a way to help, too.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
Claudio can work out
his problems on his own.
- Where are you, honey?
- Up shits creek, mother!
But there's one thing
you have to know:
What kind of approach
are we taking?
Marcos, please, give me
one minute of peace
so I can think.
You ask too many questions!
Please, I have to think.
That's being creative.
Just give me a minute.
Please. I'll be quick.
Just one minute.
Oh, my God...
- Hi, my love.
- I'm glad you called.
- Claudio...
- What is a "mezzo-soprano"?
Marcos is pressuring me.
I don't know what to do.
- Don't you have the earphone?
- Hold on.
Repeat everything
he says out loud,
and I'll answer.
He'll never notice.
Marcos! We have to value
comfort and sensuality,
but our differential is treating
women like people who think.
- And how will the print ads be?
- How will the print ads be?
I have a bit of a fever.
Of course! Newspapers!
Use a newspaper.
People think women don't read
newspapers, only magazines.
Half a page in the paper.
I don't know who's worse off:
You, with Marcos,
- or me, with these girls.
- Me, for sure.
You what?
Me. Marcos, me!
I'm also a target market
for this product.
- But you're not a woman.
- Of course not!
I mean as a consumer.
I'm also a consumer,
a man who buys this product
as a present for my wife.
Good one, honey.
There you go.
There's certain things...
Think!
Why is there a chubby girl
in the first row
who won't stop yawning?
What you can do is...
Hello.
Claudio...
The battery ran out.
What would a newspaper ad
for female consumers be?
Just use a hot chick.
That's how they want to feel.
Has it ever crossed your mind
that they may want to feel
a little more authentic?
You're being sensitive, right?
I think a little more
overtime with Cibele
will make you an expert
on women's lingerie.
That's enough.
Since I can't
be rid of you here,
we're going to the agency.
What an outrage!
Okay. I'll be right there.
Okay, bye.
Claudio, something came up.
You'd better go ahead,
I'll be there later.
So you scheduled overtime
with someone else?
It doesn't sound right.
Sounds too sad.
I have an idea.
Claudio, your horoscope says
your day will be great.
Follow me.
Marcos called and told me
you wanted to meet with
the entire creative team.
Everyone's waiting for you,
but the meeting room
is that way.
I know, but I just want you
to clear something up for me.
- Sure.
- Come with me, please.
So...
So?
So here's the thing.
How do I say this?
Have we ever...
- Have we...
- Like this. Have we?
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, but...
I'm sorry.
After all this time?
I don't get it.
If it's for the client's
fantasy, fine,
but everyone knows how
in love you are with Helena.
I am?
Don't you play dumb
with me, Claudio.
Everyone knows you are.
Helena...
You know what?
You have no idea.
Cibele, you're the best
secretary in the world.
Okay, girls,
that'll be all.
What's going on?
They're so happy!
Looks like a birthday party.
Not to mention
you haven't picked...
Ladies... Keep your cool.
They'll both get their samba.
Samba?
- Helena, I don't think you...
- No, listen.
I'd love to stand here
and chat with you,
but I'm having
the weirdest cramps,
so excuse me.
She's got her period.
And that's why I wanted
to invest in this concept.
What do you think?
I want the honest truth.
Don't try to please me.
The truth.
Listen...
Go ahead.
I think you've never
penetrated so deep
- into your target consumer.
- Great.
It's as if a spirit
got into you.
A spirit!
Excuse me, Claudio.
Helena is on line 2.
- She says it's urgent.
- Okay. Excuse me.
Thank you. Line 2.
Helena?
Go ahead.
You what?
Stop laughing, Helena.
This is serious.
Take it easy.
Here's what you do...
- Have you washed your hands?
- Yeah, I have.
That's very important.
I want you to get...
You know my little
pink makeup case?
There's a pink
makeup case in the bag.
Get a tampon in there.
Got it? Okay.
Then you tear off the plastic
strip around the middle.
Just pull on it
and take it off.
Take off the bottom, and
you'll see a little blue string.
Rotate it a little.
That's right.
Now hold it and take off
the plastic, okay?
And... You know...
Put it in.
Okay.
I'm going to hang up.
I can't talk and do this
at the same time.
Okay!
What a character...
She has a hard time
with her period.
Did you call me,
Mrs. Helena?
Bring me a hot water bottle
and some painkillers, please.
Get a grip, Mrs. Helena!
You have this every month,
and you're still not used to it?
Bring me some
ice cubes, too.
- Why? Are you mixing them?
- For my scotch.
One is melting like jelly
because of cramps,
the other one complaining
about the elephant's tail...
I don't even know who has
coffee or papaya anymore!
Poor baby...
Do you have
a booboo, honey?
I had no idea my sarcastic
look was so annoying.
Did you know I'm in pain?
I'm not being sarcastic.
I'm just used to it,
so I think it's funny
- to see your drama.
- There's no drama.
I'm not a drama queen.
I can take pain.
Punch me, if you want.
I can take pain.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
I believe you.
I'm going to get you
what I take.
You'll be all better.
Flying saucers, in general,
give out very strong
magnetic fields,
which can affect
the flow of electrons
and cause apparently
unexplainable phenomena,
such as abductions,
cosmic projections,
and out-of-body experiences.
You think we're crazy,
don't you?
- Do you believe us?
- Relax, Helena.
- Helena, right?
- No.
The minute you walked
through that door,
I noticed your auras
were switched.
Really?
Seeing as your material bodies
are merely energy terminals,
you know what happened?
An exchange of
magnetic signals,
most likely caused by
the helicoidal trajectory
of antimatter induction.
Was I clear?
I have a question:
Can we switch back
or will I get my period
every month?
Oh, God...
I'm going to need a minute
to consult the cosmos.
Cosmos!
- Who's he talking to?
- Just kidding!
- Oh, I see!
- I'll do it now.
You can switch back.
You can switch back.
We just have to
uninvert the frequency.
And how do we
uninvert this?
I am the path,
and the universe
is the answer!
Communication...
Communication...
Do you feel anything?
Communication...
Communication...
Communication...
Communication!
- Don't move.
- I can't take this anymore.
Hold still!
Lipstick, panties, tampons,
cramps, bras, high heels...
Bras kill me!
Do you think I enjoy
peeing standing up?
Being a woman is hard.
I'm not ready for this,
I wasn't made for this.
I don't know what's
still to be invented.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Hold still.
What a pain in the neck!
My chorus is singing today.
I have to look gorgeous.
Tereza's coming.
Here she comes.
Pay attention.
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you. And you?
- I'm fine.
- This is my wife Helena.
How are you?
Would you mind if she stayed
for the presentation?
- Not at all.
- Great.
Helena, I could ask Cibele
to get you some coffee
and a few magazines so you
can wait at the reception.
Absolutely not. I insist
on her presence today.
Isn't this about
the female universe?
The creator's wife should
be the first to approve it.
Come on, honey.
We're going to show
the thousand,
the million sides
there are to all women.
- Many sides indeed.
- Am I right?
Women have always been
much more skilled than men,
especially when paying
attention to detail,
showing affection,
transpiring care,
overflowing with love.
Competing with men
in the job market
hasn't hardened
women's hearts.
Exactly.
Thank you, sweetheart.
That's exactly it.
Because, even when women
become independent,
they always retain
that female sensitivity.
Right, Tereza? Always.
- They have desires and power.
- And are still women.
Go ahead.
"Affection when
and how I want it.
- That is being a woman."
- What do you think?
What do you think, Claudio?
I think it captures
the female spirit perfectly.
What do you think, Helena?
I think the campaign is very
direct and to the point.
But of course they're
going to think it's great.
The important thing is:
What do you think, Tereza?
I think Claudio is wrong.
It doesn't capture
the female spirit.
It goes beyond that.
It understands the man
in every woman
and the woman in every man.
Congratulations.
The account is all yours.
Thank you so much!
- Honey, the chorus!
- Yes, let's go.
I'm sorry, Tereza.
She has a chorus performance.
I have to go.
Please excuse me.
Thank you.
I'm coming, honey.
Claudio, where do you
think you're going?
We have to have
a little talk.
But...
Go on ahead, honey.
I'll meet you there.
Please.
Go on.
Be quick. I want to see
my wife's "little chorus".
Here's the thing:
I sold the agency...
Yesterday afternoon.
What about our deal?
If I got the account,
didn't you say you
wouldn't sell the agency?
And I didn't sell it
to the São Paulo guys,
but another buyer
approached me.
Business is business, Claudio.
You know that.
You punk!
Excuse me.
- Hi, Father.
- Just in time.
Go on, cuties.
Bring down the house.
Now the São José
girls' chorus.
They're going to sing
Beethoven's Ninth,
conducted by Mrs. Helena.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Father.
See you soon.
Okay... Follow me.
One, two, three...
You know,
I never thought you'd
make such a great
children's chorus conductor.
And I never thought,
on top of being a good driver,
that you were creative, too.
Right, but listen,
It's not that hard
to be creative
when you have
a woman's sensitivity.
And it's not that hard
to conduct a chorus, either,
when you're a creative guy.
Are you calling me square?
Didn't you just
call me insensitive?
I said women are more
sensitive than men.
- Don't you think so?
- Men are stronger, Helena.
That depends on what
you mean by "stronger".
I'm talking about
muscle strength.
That's a good one.
Only you forget
I have your muscles now.
Actually,
muscles themselves
don't mean anything.
You have to know
how to use them.
And what will you do now?
Where's your strength?
I want to see you
free yourself.
Claudio, what was that?
What was that?
Darn...
It's Saturday,
I could sleep in,
and I had to get insomnia.
You know what that's called?
Being in love.
Claudio... Claudio!
- Claudio!
- What?
Claudio, wake up!
Look!
- Look at what?
- Look at this!
What's wrong?
It happened!
Oh, my God!
Thank God!
What's up, woman?
What's with all the noise?
If they continue
going crazy like this,
we're going to have
to commit them both.
Good morning, darling.
Good morning, Cida.
Good morning isn't enough.
I've never seen
such a great day, honey.
So excited!
I guess I wasn't the only one
who didn't get any sleep.
When love comes around,
it takes hold of everyone.
Everyone goes wild.
After years, Eucrides decided
to "perform" last night.
Here, honey.
Crazy!
You're trying
to drive me crazy!
Working overtime
for Marcos on a Saturday?
Losing my Saturday.
I could be on the beach
playing soccer,
scoring chicks...
But I'm here.
Emergency meeting with the
lady who bought the agency.
Really? A woman?
Good for you guys.
Women bring good luck
to this agency.
Have you noticed
we only meet
- at our husbands' events?
- That's true.
- Good morning.
- Hi, Cibele.
Could you help us pack up
Claudio's things?
Lt'll be the worst job
he ever had me do.
Oh, Cibele!
- Excuse me.
- Go on. Thanks.
Claudio, no hard feelings.
I tried to explain,
but you wouldn't let me.
No hard feelings.
Whatever. Give me ten.
I want you to be really happy,
and you too, Barbara.
They will be very happy.
They were made
for one another.
Honey!
I'm so glad you're here!
I called a thousand times,
but your cell phone was off.
Mother, I'm a little off.
I don't understand
what you're doing here.
Everyone, I'd like you to meet
Vivian Medeiros de Albuquerque,
the company's new partner.
She bought my shares.
- What?
- What?
I believe in Claudio's
talent, honey.
People who say
happiness can't be bought
just don't know
where the store is.
What a lovely, pleasant place.
Wonderful!
Too bad I can't work here.
Let's go, please.
The decorator will be
over at noon,
and he's coming
from São Paulo.
And I still have to stop
by the beauty parlor.
I'm talking about
serious matters,
and you're worried about
beauty parlors and decorators!
I don't just think
of frivolous things.
Do you think it's easy to take
care of a house, a family?
Do you think it's easy
to support a house, a family,
the way you spend?
- All you think of is you.
- All you think of is you.
- That's the problem.
- That's the problem.
- Lf I were you...
- If I were you...
- What?
- What?
- Again?
- Again?
Men and women
are strange creatures.
Venus and Mars.
Two different planets.
It's hard to live
with that person,
but it's impossible
to live without them.
Ooh, what are you doing?
I'm driving,
for God's sake!
But that problem
will never be solved.
There isn't really
a solution to that problem.
Because it isn't
actually even a problem.
- It's life.
- It's life.
- Hey!
- Don't start.
- I've had enough.
- Oh, Helena,
I forgot to tell you.
- What?
- I'm trying to remember.
- Tell me.
- At the party... I'll tell you.
What happened,
at the party?
- It's ridiculous!
- Tell me.
- Hold on!
- You always do this.
I'm just trying to remember
everything that happened.
So tell me. Hurry up.
- Tell me.
- Barbara told me,
told everyone, actually,
that Marcos hasn't
"performed" in months.
- She's in a terrible state.
- So that's it.
I knew it.
That's why she's on edge.
I also noticed she's been
taking a lot of pills.
Really? Why?
Because she's unfulfilled,
so she wants to lose weight.
I shouldn't laugh,
but it's pretty crazy.
All that attitude...
Oh, what about Carmelia?
- What about her?
- Didn't you notice?
- Her surgery.
- Right.
- She looked awful.
- She's not the only one.
At one point, I couldn't
understand what she said.
- I swear to God.
- She got her body done, too.
She turned to me,
thinking she was hot...
She said, "Listen Claudio,
you're in advertising..."
You're laughing...
