NETFLIX PRESENTS
How do you feel?
I feel like I went through a windshield.
You did go through a windshield.
The bullet?
Don't worry.
You did it.
Areski?
He'll do everything in
his power to get the evidence.
He ran away.
He left everything behind.
His wife and his kid.
Everyone is looking for him.
I promise we'll get him.
You need to question Marco.
I'm sure he knows where he is.
Tell me you went to the farm, Julia.
Tell me you arrested that son of a bitch.
I went to the farm.
I saw what he did to your brother.
I'm sorry.
Where is Marco?
There's no way.
- Lino...
- I cuffed him myself.
No way he got away on his own.
Someone helped him.
- Lino, please, listen to me.
- No, you should've listened to me.
- Why didn't I kill him?
- Let me explain.
- I promise, it's...
- There's nothing to explain.
I need to be alone.
- You did the right thing.
- We're making a huge mistake.
Why didn't you notify the precinct?
We're not telling anyone.
We need to talk, Julia.
HAIR SALON
Lino, it's been six months.
Areski isn't coming back.
Not for me. Not for his son.
I don't want to get you into trouble,
but you need to stop following
me day and night. Understand?
Get out.
When was the last time you slept?
Shit, Lino.
Hey!
I've got guys stationed
at her place every night.
Everyone's tapped, even his parents.
She's terrified. No need to make it worse.
Let's go.
Move on, Lino.
It's what Charas would have wanted.
How would you know?
Suspicious vehicle on
Highway D60. Waiting for confirmation.
Traffic at a crawl.
Accident reported at kilometer post 130.
Him again.
Should we tell Julia?
If he wants to waste time
here with us, let him.
You scared she'll ask you
to get rid of him yourself?
He snuck up on me.
If I'd been there,
it wouldn't have happened.
Sure.
He took down ten cops,
but you would've stopped him.
You wanna see?
Go ahead.
Reports of gunshots
on Europe Boulevard.
Calling units to proceed
immediately to the area.
Stella.
- Areski sent us.
- Get out!
Shit.
Guys, come quick!
Ah!
Areski sent them.
That bastard is connected.
I wanna be there when you question them.
No way.
You have to be a cop for that.
You've had six months to get your
act together. I'm sick of chasing you.
You want to help me find Areski?
Don't half-ass it.
If you show up tomorrow, you're staying.
Charas didn't give you a second chance
so you can live in a car like a bum.
- I don't need your pity.
- Relax, it's not to my place.
Last chance, buddy.
Okay.
Let's get you fixed up.
One thing, though...
I hope you like blue.
ONE YEAR LATER
No time for questions.
We got the info from an informer.
They hit the road earlier than expected.
We don't know how much they have,
but they can't cross the border.
The Guardia is waiting for them.
Delta, bring up the rear.
Victoria, channel two.
Yann is there waiting.
Don't come back empty-handed.
Let's go, you and me.
Delta, we're taking over.
Yann, block the ramp, block it.
Woo-hoo!
Do I take it or not?
- Yes or no?
- Go ahead.
Two cars driving
the wrong way. French police are involved.
Spaniards!
HQ, we just crossed the border,
interception imminent.
Now, Lino.
France is over there.
This is Spain.
Didn't Charas explain?
At least he followed the rules.
Thanks for the bust.
You can keep the two guys,
but I'm leaving with the dope.
No. Anything that crosses
the border is mine.
I scratched my ride
catching these assholes.
That piece of shit
was already scratched to hell.
Hey!
- Do you know who this car belonged to?
- Yes.
Well then?
Give me that.
Lino?
Here.
Charas was my friend.
I know what you lost that day.
I'll never forgive myself
for recommending Marco to Charas.
Marco betrayed me.
God only knows how many kilos of dope
he and Areski let through.
They'll slip up, and I'll be there.
You're forgetting
they're also wanted in Spain.
So we both want to catch them.
I'll send you a photo after I get them.
Keep 'em.
Wouldn't want you to leave empty-handed.
- You held your own earlier.
- Thanks.
It's so stupid.
If Yann had blocked the ramp,
we'd have ten kilos.
Hey now! We seized half a pack of smokes.
Alvaro is a good guy.
So long as he doesn't nab Marco before me,
he's great.
You... you want to grab a beer?
- A beer?
- Yeah, a beer.
Just you and me, or...
Well, or with the others.
Whatever you want.
Uh... I can't tonight.
- But come by my place this weekend?
- Right, this weekend.
Lino!
How are you?
- Yes?
- The intel was good. He's here.
Why are you waiting to take him out?
Too risky.
Exposed area, single entrance.
Two cameras outside.
I can't make it look like an accident.
I need 48 hours more.
We don't have 48 hours, Youri.
They could move him at any time.
I'm not risking leading my men
into a trap. Sorry, Commander.
You're leaving me no choice.
Plan B. I'll send you the info.
- Wait for my signal.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
You know
that won't protect you, right?
Turn it on.
- Hit it. I wanna know how long it holds.
- I'm hitting it.
Victoria?
Less power, then hit it again.
- You sure?
- Do it!
- Shit...
- Hey, somebody check the power.
What the hell?
You'll get yourself killed. Take that off.
You don't need it
if you know how to drive.
Hello?
Lino?
Yes, speaking.
I'm Mado's health caretaker.
She's your adoptive mother, correct?
More like my guardian, but... How is she?
Not very well, actually.
She's very ill.
She would really like
to see your brother Quentin again.
Do you know how I could reach him?
That'll be hard. He died last year.
Oh... I'm very sorry to hear that.
That's my fault.
I should've visited a long time ago.
Could you visit today?
Could you give me her address, please?
I'll send it to you.
But I should warn you, it's pretty remote.
- Okay, I'll leave now.
- See you soon.
- He'll be there in an hour.
- Nobody can resist a call from Mommy.
Hey...
We won't end up like Areski, I promise.
Yes?
What did you tell Lino?
Excuse me?
He's at the hideout.
- If... If he kills him, Julia...
- I'm on my way.
Julia?
Back so soon?
I'm starting to think
you can't live without...
Fuck.
Pick up. Pick up!
Lino?
Lino?
Don't move. Stay where you are.
Don't touch Marco.
Lino, please, I... I'll explain.
But wait until I get there.
Lino, answ...
Victoria, this is Julia.
I read you.
Give me a location on Lino.
Lino!
Please, you have to help me.
Get out.
Come on. Come on.
Tell me where Areski is.
No one knows where he is.
Lino, come with me.
I don't think so. That son of a bitch
has been there for a year.
- I've been lied to! I want to know why.
- Get out.
Hey... Hey!
This wasn't part of the deal.
What deal?
- How did you find him?
- Anonymous call. A woman.
- Pretty well-informed.
- It's them.
You can bet they're already on their way.
Julia is coming to get you out.
Hey! No one's getting anyone out
till you tell me who you're talking about.
- Alexander Resz.
- The head of Narcotics.
It's him, and he wanted
Lino to do his dirty work.
Make it look like a settling of scores.
Why would a cop want him dead?
Aside from me?
You think Areski and I were working alone?
You think we weren't answering to anyone?
If Resz was in on this from the start,
- why are you waiting to take him down?
- Not enough evidence.
Without Areski,
the case isn't strong enough,
so in the meantime,
I'm protecting our only witness.
I brought him alive, didn't I?
I could have killed this piece of shit.
- That's not what I want.
- What do you want?
I want him to pay!
When all this is over,
will he go to prison over my brother?
That's what I want to know.
Yes, he'll go to prison.
- Tell him the truth.
- Shut it.
He deserves to know.
You're going to let him walk?
He'll remain
in the witness protection program.
A brand-new start.
He rats on three fucking dirty cops
and you let him go?
These aren't any old dirty cops. Lino...
Did Julia know?
- Did she know what?
- That he would walk!
Yes, she knew.
- Julia, where are you?
- Almost in the city.
Okay, Resz is behind all of this.
- Shit.
- You need to get Marco out right away.
- What about Lino?
- He knows everything. I had no choice.
I told you this was a mistake.
Julia? Julia!
Don't leave Lino without any surveillance.
What do you expect him to do?
- You can't protect me. Let me go.
- No.
As long as I'm with you,
Alexander will find me.
I'm not letting
a child killer loose.
The kid?
He didn't matter so much
when you offered me this deal.
Open your trap again,
and you'll leave with Lino.
Moss?
Youri Baptista. I'm under the orders
of Commander Alexander Resz.
In the ongoing search
for fugitive Areski Novak,
you're to turn over any information or
persons that might lead to his capture.
Get rid of them,
and we'll talk.
No, no, no, no! Hey, hey, hey! No, no.
I know his partner Marco Lopez is here.
And I'm here to get him.
He's not here.
Where are we going?
No...
No.
We got him.
Pull the car into the parking lot.
Ah!
Come on.
He just escaped!
Around to the other side!
Around to the other side! Go!
...a grenade! He's coming your way!
Careful, he has a hostage! Stop him!
- He must be stopped right away!
- Hey!
What's he doing? Move it, come on.
Don't move! Let him go! Let him go!
Get him, damn it!
Catch him!
Hey!
Come on!
Let him go, damn it!
Easy! Easy! Quit moving!
Let's go!
Stop moving!
Hold him! Hold him!
Get in there!
Go, go!
Ah!
After the accident
on highway 343,
the vehicles have been removed.
Traffic has returned to normal.
Nothing else to report. Over and out.
Alvaro, it's Lino!
What's with the photo?
I'm an hour away from the border.
You still want Marco or not?
Then listen carefully.
This is precinct.
Active car chase of Renault 21.
All units proceed to the area.
Suspect has a hostage in the trunk.
- Moss, what is this shit?
- It's Lino.
He's kidnapped Marco.
I know where he'll go.
Julia, if he turns him over
to the Spaniards...
I know. I got it! Over!
Hurry up, hurry up!
Ooh.
ANDORRA
Shit!
We're losing him.
He's headed for Verdanson.
I repeat, headed for Verdanson.
Approaching the canal, on my way.
She's okay.
She's okay. She's okay.
She's okay. She's okay.
Julia, you okay?
You ride with Victoria.
You're in
no fucking state to drive!
Hey! Let me drive!
There were dozens of witnesses.
We were right in the police station.
I wasn't going to off Marco
in front of everyone.
This asshole is going to
take us down because of you...
I'm starting to miss Areski.
Catch up with him
and kill him before I get involved!
Make me a list of all checkpoints
from here to the border
and send all the men toward my location.
Backup requested at
checkpoints D60, D65,
A75, D618, D914, D211.
Lino!
Julia?
Julia! Talk to me. Are you hurt?
- I'm coming, Lino. I'm gonna kill you!
- Oh shit, I thought you were dead!
You're going to regret I'm not!
End this, now!
- You that know I can't.
- What do you think you're doing?
- The only thing worth doing.
- You'll get stopped at a checkpoint!
You're fucking up your life,
Stella, the kid... You...
I can't let him walk free.
Not this time, Julia.
- It's not too late. Let me help you!
- Go to hell!
Lino!
- You knew Marco would walk!
- You think I had a choice?
I had no choice!
You're killing Charas all over again.
And you'll never hold a candle to him.
- What would he have done in your shoes?
- Lino!
Attention all cars,
traffic is alternate.
Yeah, we're here.
Nothing at the other checkpoints,
but his phone stopped pinging.
Julia, you need a doctor.
No.
I know he's still here.
Oh!
It's over, man.
Everyone's looking for us now.
Alex will kill us. He'll kill Julia.
You'll never cross the border.
There's a checkpoint ten kilometers away.
They're not searching the cars,
just filtering them out.
We should be fine.
Be right back.
So lovely
to have you back with us.
Go fuck yourself.
He will be tried,
you have my word.
Make sure to keep your phone on you.
Julia's not the only one out for him.
- What are you going to do?
- Buy you as much time as I can.
Thank you, Alvaro.
Explain it to me someday?
You know,
Charas would be pleased.
Hello?
I don't know how to tell you this, I...
There's no need. I already know.
I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry.
- Lino...
- I didn't want the two of you
- to go through that again, I...
- Lino.
I know.
You're not Areski.
It's because you're stubborn and never
listen to anyone that we're still alive.
So I don't know what you're up to,
but finish what you started.
And stay alive.
Got it.
I'm going to hang up
before they ping your phone, okay?
I love you.
This is precinct.
Vehicle southbound on D67,
headed toward central checkpoint.
Tail it, I'm on my way.
Yann, stay here, watch the checkpoint.
Don't make a sound back there, eh?
Whatever you do,
stay under the speed limit.
Now take it easy...
I love this guy.
Come on, we're almost there.
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
Lino!
Shit!
Got him.
Roger.
State your location for reinforcements.
Back up.
I repeat,
state your location.
On your knees.
On your knees.
- Yann, this is Julia.
- I read you.
Search all the cars.
No one gets through without inspection.
Lino doesn't have Marco.
- I repeat, Lino doesn't have Marco.
- Okay, roger that.
Search every vehicle, go!
Spike strip!
Shit. What do we do?
Who helped you?
Alvaro's as stupid as you are.
Alvaro still has principles.
He was friends with Charas for a reason.
Open the trunk.
Yeah, all right.
- Turn around. Pull out.
- Are you sure?
- We'll go through the port.
- What?
There's no other way. Come on.
Julia, this is Yann.
Suspicious van at the checkpoint.
Color is white. Spanish plates.
Did you stop it?
No, it turned around and took the D65.
Permission to tail him.
No, you stay at the checkpoint
and keep searching cars.
But Julia...
Last chance to save Alvaro.
- Victoria, this is Julia.
- Go ahead.
Put up a checkpoint at D65.
We are looking
for a white van with Spanish plates.
Priority one.
Victoria?
Precinct is saying
there's already a checkpoint.
- Who authorized it?
- Commander Resz.
We need to warn Alvaro right now!
Go on, let's go ahead.
Follow their orders.
Lino!
Alvaro, listen to me, you're about
to fall into a trap. Turn around!
I want to talk to Lino.
I'm here, Alvaro!
They want to kill Marco.
They'll kill you too.
What do we do?
Sorry, Julia.
No turning back.
Go, step on it, go!
You okay?
Everything okay?
I'm fine! So is the cargo.
But what the hell's going on?
Let me go.
Fuck!
Stop! Stop! Stop! It's okay. It's okay.
Stop! No. I'm fine! I'm fine!
My driver's been hit.
We've lost them,
but not for long.
- Where are you?
- Ten kilometers from the border.
But we won't make it.
Find somewhere to lay low.
I'm sending all my manpower.
What are you doing?
We're the closest.
Victoria, this is Julia.
All units to my location.
And send an ambulance.
If we stay here, we don't stand a chance.
It'll be too late.
You need me, Julia.
I'm not done with you yet.
They'll be back.
How do you feel?
I'm fine.
You put pressure on it. I'll drive.
They're going to kill us all.
They're going to kill us all.
I'm the one they want, Alvaro.
Just let me go.
- Let me go.
- Hey!
Shit.
Alvaro!
This is my problem.
Let me go. Let me go!
You have two choices.
Go to prison or don't leave here alive.
- No! No! No!
- There's no time. Get back in!
Come on. Keep it going.
You got this. You got this, Julio.
Fuck!
Julia. I think that's Julia.
You got this. We're almost there.
Come on. Come on, we're almost there.
Hold on. Hold on.
It's just a little further. Hold on.
Did you see that?
Crazy!
Ha!
Ah.
Son of a bitch!
Grr!
Watch out, watch out!
Ah! Jesus! Fuck.
Marco! Get in!
- Fuck, speed up!
- I know what I'm doing.
Ooh!
Julia...
We need to get out of here.
We have extra units
on their way.
Coming to D67 checkpoint. We have
at least eight more units on their way.
Hey! Yann! Stop!
On your feet.
It's fine. I have Marco. It's over.
Orders from Moss.
Moss, this is Julia.
Get Marco out of there. I'll contact you
to give you the rendezvous point.
I'm not doing anything
till you let Lino go.
You don't decide.
I'll take care of him,
you focus on protecting Marco.
The threat's been eliminated.
He's got nothing to fear!
Lino is under arrest.
There's nothing you can do for him.
Listen to me and get out of there!
No, no, no, you listen to me now.
If you arrest him, I'm handing over Marco
to the Spanish myself. Is that clear?
You'll screw everything up!
Yeah, you know I won't hesitate!
Tell Yann to release him!
Julia, you know I can't do that!
You offered a deal to a murderer!
- You find a solution for Lino...
- Julia!
...and you'd better do it quick!
Julia!
Julia?
Julia, what's going on?
Julia!
What is going on?
Julia! Julia!
Victoria!
Get back in!
Look!
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Take care of him.
Don't just stand there.
He needs you.
Ah!
WELCOME TO SPAIN
FRENCH SPOKEN HERE
Police.
Police!
Please don't hang up, madam.
I'm not coming with you, Julia.
Drop the gun.
Just let him go.
Don't be stupid. Listen to him.
Slide the gun over here.
Shit.
Shit.
He can't die.
God, I'm fucked.
Precinct...
Code 10-01.
Precinct, come in!
Shit, answer.
Victoria, it's Julia!
Fucking answer.
RESTAURANT CHA KAO
Oh shit...
Please look after Stella and the kid.
Okay?
Okay.
We were in combat.
He made a run for it.
I had no choice. I fired.
No coming back from that.
A whole year's work.
A case file as thick as a brick,
and we can't use any of it.
- Your mission was to protect him.
- Fuck the mission.
I killed Marco.
- Lino killed Marco.
- No.
He got what he wanted.
- He got his revenge.
- No, he did it to protect me.
It doesn't matter.
It won't change a thing.
Lino killed Marco, period.
When the Spanish are through with him,
they'll come to us for answers.
So we'll play the hand Lino dealt us
and pin it all on him.
And we'll be fine.
I'm done lying for you.
I quit.
This is what we pulled
from the cop car.
I don't think it brought
much luck to the previous owner.
Did you know him?
I'll take it.
I'll take the minivan out front as well.
What's gonna happen with the bike?
Whatever you want. You can have it.
Want to see what else I have in stock?
No.
It's perfect for family trips.
