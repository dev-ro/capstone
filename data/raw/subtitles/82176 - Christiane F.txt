CHRISTIANE F.
WE CHILDREN FROM ZOO STATION
Piss and shit all over the place;
just take a good look at it
At first sight it looks fine,
with its lawns...
...and shopping centres
But the staircases of the
flats stink
What can kids do, when they're
playing outside?
They'll shit themselves waiting for
the lift, so they go in the lobby
I've lived here since I was six,
with my mother, sister and cat
I've had enough of it
The posters are all over town
"Sound. Europe's latest disco"
I want to go to it
One Saturday I told mother
I'd sleep over at Kessi's
Kessi is top of my class,
everyone approves of her
She's got real tits already;
I admire her
"Sound" is her second home;
she's here every Saturday
She's taking me for the first time
Get a move on!
Is she sixteen?
Sure, in my class
-Is Atze here?
-When is he never here?
Put your bag there. You can't walk
around with a plastic bag here
Wait here
Cherry juice
We're in the cinema
Crazy stuff
-Won't you have some?
-I'm not in the mood yet
-Your first, eh?
-Don't talk crap
Stop that
You shouldn't have taken that trip
Too much for you?
Are you O.K.?
This is Axel
I'm Detlev
I'm going back
Coming back in?
See you
-Pitty, where have you been?
-He's been playing with the kids
-Why weren't you at school?
-I've been packing
What's that?
Has the old man won you over?
You're leaving because of
Mum's friend?
That's Dad; he's waiting for me
downstairs
Mum's slaving for us and you
just want to clear off
Be happy, it leaves more for you
No, I want you to stay here
And I want to try it with Dad
-Remember all the trouble he caused?
-He wants to make up for it
Coming down with me?
Won't you think it over?
I don't understand you
Any message for Dad?
Don't be cross
Why no lights?
Did you see Sabine?
-Now we two are alone
-She'll be back
-You think so?
-She won't stick it out with Dad
You know what?
We'll have a nice evening together
Turn it
-Careful, it's running
-That's what I want
It's Klaus. I invited him, so we're
not so alone. Do you mind?
Can I borrow your shoes tonight?
You're going out?
Just to Kessi's
If you must
I've something for you
I hope you like it
Yes, thanks
Are we going somewhere? Anywhere?
-Coming, too?
-Where?
I'm too tired
Sleep when you're dead
Cops!
I hope they didn't get Kessi
-Mum thinks I'm sleeping at her place
-And her Mum thinks she's with you?
Do you often go to Sound?
-Will you be there next week?
-Of course
This is really high
I'm feeling dizzy
Been on a trip again?
You don't think much of trips?
Not really
Want one?
Did you do that yourself?
-Didn't it hurt?
-Yes, but I was bored
It's almost dawn
-Are you going home?
-What about you?
I'm going to my place;
come with me, if you like
I'm staying at Axel's
Are you angry now?
We thought the cops had got you
Look, two Martians
She was that loaded, there was hardly
enough room for her in the lift
The cops
Come over here
I think they're still looking for us
You ought to arrest him;
he's an addict
You're coming with me
Keep away from each other
No silly ideas for Kessi
Can you do homework with such a row?
It's the record Klaus gave me
Klaus gave me this record
It doesn't mean it should be so Ioud
David Bowie is coming to Berlin
The guy on the record from Klaus
You want to go?
Can Kessi come, too?
I often sleep at her place
I might be able to get two tickets
through the office
Have you hurt yourseIf?
That's a tattoo
A what?
A tattoo. It's not quite finished
You'll never get it off
Well, you have to walk around with it
-I've just met a boy
-And he has one like it
You know, I didn't really think of
going to the concert with Kessi
I get you
-Are you going to the concert, too?
-I can't afford it
What have you bought? "H"?
You can swallow three trips at once,
or something else to turn you on
I can get you anything,
but leave "H" alone
Otherwise, I won't see you again
Axel, Detlev wants to take "H"
If he fancies it
Didn't you understand me?
If he wants to take it, he will
-Can't you talk to him?
-Me, of all people?
What do you mean?
I thought you were his friend
I thought he lived at your place
Stay cool, kid
Take something before you flip out
Look at them. The cooler they are,
the more shots they've had
What's up?
-You look like a corpse
-Because I'm a blood donor
-Why do you do it?
-Because I need the dough
I'll see if somebody's got
a Valium left for us
Mandrax. I couldn't get Valium
-Is he ill?
-He needs a shot
-Apart from me, who doesn't shoot up?
-No one I know
Got any dough?
Twenty marks
I'll get some. Wait outside
I've got some. And I've got
my old man's car
Ciao, thanks for the dough
Open up
I want to try it
No way
I paid for it
I want my share
Let me in
I don't shoot up, I just sniff
Just think
-Just for once
-As they all say
I'm in control of myself
Take that, and you'll soon be
as far gone as me
-You'll be a corpse then
-From giving blood?
Why don't you join us?
Something wrong?
Got a trip for me?
What do you want with a trip?
-Do you want a drink?
-Cherry juice
I'll get it; I won't be long
-What did Babsie want from you?
-A trip
Be careful, don't give her one.
She swallows all she can get
-And what do you do?
-It's not the same at all
Know somewhere I can sleep?
Your own home
I don't want to go home,
I'm fed up with it
There's some sexy guys here
Are you crazy?
-You can talk
-Do you copy everything I do?
I only wanted to know
what you feel like
Groovy, eh?
Axel, it's me
Make yourself at home
This is for you
Axel made it for you
Really?
Does your mother know
where you're sleeping?
Sure, she isn't stupid
We see each other only at weekends
We can meet when I come back
from school
We can't do that
Why not?
I go to Zoo Station
What for?
Pick-ups
Bullshit
Honestly
Really?
With the pansies?
I only jerk them off
It's nothing, considering
what they pay
Don't you go to bed with them?
Yes, but even then I don't do more
What do you feel?
It's a job. They mustn't touch me
I won't let them jerk me off.
It wouldn't be a job then
-So it doesn't excite you
-It's repulsive. Just for dough
Don't you like me so much now?
Good night
You can get up now.
My mother has left
-Are you fourteen already?
-I'm an adult from today on
That looks great
You reckon?
-Have you got anything to wear?
-I didn't come here naked
-You can't wear the same old rags
-Why not?
Clean things. You can wear
my Bowie jacket
Here's something to turn you on
Have you got any "H"?
Are you crazy?
Don't touch it
I only want to try it
I have myseIf under control
As they all say
When you leave, shut the door
properly
Come again soon
Sure, I will
Hey, girl, how much?
Excuse me, do you fuck? I pay a lot
Muhametto, leave her alone.
Go on, clear off
Are you catching a train?
No. Are you? Looking for Detlev, too?
Has he disappeared?
There's "Pissnelke".
He lets me piss on him
-What does he do?
-It's what he wants
Nonsense
Ask him yourseIf
I stand over him and piss
-I can't do it if I'm watched
-He grabs my prick
Axel, come here
Axel can do that.
The punters like him
Who's that?
"Stuttering Max". He only comes
when he's flogged
Look who's here
Don't come here. I won't have
my girl friend coming to "Zoo"
The scum of the earth.
You don't belong here
Especially not on your birthday
I wanted to bring cake for you
And this. Mother said I was to
buy myself something nice
"Who wants to piss in my mouth?
I drink anything"
Axel, there's something for you
-I want to shoot up today, too
-No way
Whether I shoot or sniff,
it makes no difference
-It does. A shot is like a hammer
-Don't talk shit
It's a sexual climax
Shit, it's clogged. Try and see
if you can get one through
-You can ditch that one after
-Don't talk crap
Can you lend me your kit?
Keep clear of that, girl
Please help me
You've no idea
