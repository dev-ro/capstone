<b><font color="#ffff00">(man)</font></b> In the last 50 years,
we've doubled our population,
tripled the amount
of food and water we use,
and we have quadrupled
the use of fossil fuels.
Every four days, there's a million
more people on the planet.
How is the world gonna cope
with this explosion in population?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(man 2)</font></b> The UN predicts
that, by the end of the decade,
we will have a population of ten billion.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(Obama)</font></b> I am a firm believer
that climate change is real,
that it is impacted by human behavior.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(man)</font></b> The government has declared
most of South America a disaster zone.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(woman)</font></b>
Extreme drought and massive dust storms
have shut down
the Earth's entire agricultural system.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(man)</font></b>
Too many people, not enough food.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(man 2)</font></b>
In an effort to combat the food shortage,
the European Federation
has placed the world's future
in the hands of science.
The development
of more resilient, high-yield,
genetically modified crops
is being fast-tracked around the globe.
Shelves once empty are now fully-stocked.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(woman)</font></b> But the tinkering with nature
has created long-term consequences.
Across the world,
we are witnessing a staggering spike
in multiple births and genetic defects.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(man)</font></b>
The solution is now feeding the problem.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(man 2)</font></b>
It is the biggest crisis in human history.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(woman)</font></b> Political activist
and renowned conservation biologist
Dr. Nicolette Cayman
has prompted the Federation
to institute
a "one child per family" policy
called the "Child Allocation Act."
We are one human family
sharing this Earth.
Today, together, we make history.
The Child Allocation Act
is the first vital step
towards preserving our planet
and making a better future
for our children.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(man)</font></b>
New legislation has been swift.
Check points have been
erected across the nation.
All citizens are required to wear
a Bureau-issued identity bracelet.
And, from this day forth,
illegally conceived siblings
will be remanded
to Bureau-enforced cryosleep.
Children are more than just children.
They are the future.
With cryosleep, we'll make sure
your child rests peacefully,
humanely, free from hunger,
safe from harm,
while we work to build
a better, brighter future.
Cryosleep.
Awake to a better world.
I know there's...
maybe a little resistance,
but, with the "one child" policy...
it may give us some time.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(babies crying)</font></b>
I'm so sorry, Mr. Settman.
We did everything we could.
If we were better equipped,
there's a chance
we might've been able to saved her.
She knew the risks.
She knew you wouldn't report her.
- And the father?
- Who knows?
My daughter...
We haven't spoken in years.
How do you plan on hiding this?
How will you cope?
I'll manage.
I'll have to.
Have you thought about names?
Well...
There are seven.
So...
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

- No, ma'am.
That's the great Langston Hughes,

Haven't I already told you that?
Must have slipped my mind.
Tell me, Miss Settman,
what's your secret?
Last night, you're puking in the planter,
but, today,
you're looking fresh as a daisy.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>

Dinner is served.
- That's interesting.
- Spreadsheets for tomorrow.

- <b><font color="#ffff00">(indistinct chatter)</font></b>
- You are always starving.
- I think you might have worms.
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(indistinct chatter)</font></b>
- Oh, come on, Saturday.
I hope I have worms.
We can cook them next week.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(giggling)</font></b>
- Ugh, that's gross.
- It's delicious.
It's kind of beautiful.
- It's a fucking rat.
- It's actually quite good.
At least, it tastes like something,
unlike that engineered shit you're eating.
Oh, come on, Wednesday.
You'd eat anything.
- Deep-fried pig dick on a stick.
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(laughter)</font></b>
You'd buy it and you'd eat it.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(laughter)</font></b>

- <b><font color="#ffff00">(laughter continues)</font></b>
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- You seem...
I know. It's just...
my big presentation is tomorrow.
You mean "our" presentation.
No thanks to you
getting shitfaced last night.
Yeah, Eddie said
you threw up in the planter.
I didn't know what to say.
I felt really embarrassed.
I was entertaining one of our clients.
I might have overdone it
on the martinis. Shoot me.
You have to tell us everything, Saturday.
How can you be so stupid?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b>
I'm just tired. Tomorrow's a big day.
If we get this promotion,
it's all thanks to Friday.
She makes us all look like a genius.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(mutters)</font></b>
It's a team effort.
You guys did the legwork.
I just crunch numbers.
Seven minds are better than one.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(man)</font></b>
You must work collectively.
You're stronger together
than you are alone.
In time, we will select a career
that capitalizes on your joint skills.
What are you waiting for?
Go on, go on. Solve the problem.
May I see?
Very good.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(blowing whistle)</font></b>

<b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b>
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(bracelet beeping, whirring)</font></b>
- Pay attention, girls.
Tomorrow... is a big day.
You know how there are
seven days in the week.
Well, starting tomorrow,
you will each get to go outside
on the day of the week that is your name.
That means Sunday will get
to go outside on Sunday,
Monday on Monday,
Tuesday on Tuesday, and so on.
In here, I want you to be who you are,
dress the way you wish.
I want you to be creative
and express yourself.
But, outside of these walls,
you will all take on the singular identity
of Karen Settman, named after your mother.
- Can I play outside?
- Yes, you can, as long as it's your day.
But you can never go outside together
at the same time, ever.
Even with your bracelet.
And, wherever you are
and whatever you're doing...
you can never tell a soul
that you're a sibling.
That's very important. You understand?
Okay. Well, we begin tomorrow.
Starting with you, Thursday.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(man sighs)</font></b>
You ready to do this?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(breathes deeply)</font></b>

It's the time to share

Okay?

- Oh, God.
- Poor kid. Straight to the cryobank.
With Cayman running for Parliament,
security's getting tighter.
I fucking hate that bitch.
I don't know.
Maybe cryosleep isn't such a bad idea.
We turn ourselves in, get frozen,
play Sleeping Beauty
until the population drops.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b> I heard you still dream,
like, horrible nightmares
for hundreds of years.
By the time you wake up,
everyone you know and love will be gone.
Well, we go to sleep together,
we wake up together.
The Child Allocation Act
will be a thing of the past,
and we can finally live our own lives.
Are we really gonna have
this conversation again?
Why can't you just accept
that this is your family?
This isn't a family.
It's a repressive regime.
I didn't pick this life
any more than you did.
Yet you live it so perfectly.
Karen Settman from cradle to grave.
- It's disgusting.
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(scoffs)</font></b> What do you care?
Your only ambition was to be
a total loser, which you are.
Fuck you, Monday.
Just because I have
my own personality and dreams,
and I want to have a relationship
that is more than just a random fuck
with someone that I will never see again?
I'm sick to death
of Miss Karen fucking Settman.
Karen Settman is the foundation
we built our lives on.
No, she's a mask,
a mask we put on one day a week.
One day a week
we can go out into the real world,
and we can't even be ourselves.
- We have to be a fake person.
- Oh, shut up, both of you!
- You're driving us all crazy.
- Yeah, this is our life. It is what it is.
Being trapped in this prison
six days a week isn't a life.
It's a slow, agonizing,
soul-sucking death.

Or you'll be late for your recital.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(piano continues playing)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(door closing)</font></b>
So... you didn't see her leave...

One mistake is all it takes
to put all your lives at risk.
I hate Karen Settman!
I wish I had never been born!
Enough!
You want to get taken away?
Get frozen for all eternity
in that god-awful machine
and never see me or your sisters again?
Go.
Monday.
I warned you.
Everything you do affects each other.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(ominous music playing)</font></b>
- What's that for?
- Keep still.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(groans)</font></b>

Monday...
I need you to be brave.

Will it hurt?
Yes.
Don't move.

<b><font color="#ffff00">(shower running)</font></b>

- Shut up.
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(shower curtains closing)</font></b>
You're burning up. You running a fever?
No.
- You sure?
- I'm fine.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(vomits, coughs)</font></b>

Big day at work.
These lines are getting worse.
Last week, a woman gave birth right here
because she couldn't get through.
- No kidding.
- Of course, it had to happen on my day.
Mondays are the worst.
I hate checkpoint duty.
Except I get to see you.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(beeping)</font></b>
I'm afraid I have to ask you
a couple of questions.
The Bureau's a stickler for protocol.
You understand.
- What's your name?
- Karen Settman.
- Karen, do you have any siblings?
- No.
You carrying any contraband?
No.
Are you sure?
- Do I have to body search you?
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(thunder rumbling)</font></b>
You may proceed.
- Karen.
- Jerry.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(elevator whirring)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b>
So...
Today's the big day, huh?
We'll see who gets the promotion.
All these years, I've been trying
to figure out your angle.
I always thought, with a body like that,
you'd fuck your way to the top.
But then it turns out,
you're a frigid bitch.
- Just because I find you repulsive?
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
You're not interested in anyone.
Working here, night after night,
like a fucking robot.
You think you have us all fooled,
don't you?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(elevator dings, doors open)</font></b>

Where the hell is she?
- Did you try her again?
- Yeah. Straight to voicemail.
- Maybe she got held up.
- She would have called.
Ping her bracelet.
- That's weird.
- What?
Her GPS locator is off.
She's not showing up on the grid.
- She can't just vanish.
- Oh, yes, you can... if you want to.
Maybe she was in an accident.
Run a search.
Um, hospitals, police records.
What if Monday's hurt? Or dead?
And the authorities find her
before we do? <b><font color="#ffff00">(gasps)</font></b>
Then... Karen Settman no longer exists.
And our lives are over.
Jeez, she's only a few minutes late.
Monday's never been late
for an end of day meeting.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b>
Ever.

Really? Pot brownie?
It's medicinal.
You know it's good for my nerves.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(exhales deeply)</font></b>
I have a bad feeling about this.
Remember what happened last time
two of us were out there at once.
That was bad.
We gotta figure out where Monday is.
You gotta act as if everything is normal.
Easy for you to say. It's not your day.
What if we've been listed?
Listen to me.
If Karen Settman's been listed,
the Bureau would've kicked in the door,
and we'd all be processed by now.
Well...
technically speaking,
one of us would get to live.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(elevator whirring)</font></b>

Stay focused, Tuesday.
Check the calendar, desktop,
anything that might give us a clue.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(door opens)</font></b>
I've got the brief
for your conference call.
Vicky, when was the last time
you synched my tablet?
9:03 this morning. Why?
Um, I forgot to log out last night.
You left early to celebrate.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
Yes, of course.
Um...
<b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
Where did I go again?
Your favorite bar. Harry's.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
Yes, of course. Harry's. Thanks.
You're welcome.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(door closes)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(suspenseful music playing)</font></b>
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b> Cheers.
- Cheers.
Mm...
<b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
Last night, um...
do you remember what...
what time I left?
You only stayed for one drink.
You barely touched it.
I think that colleague of yours
put you off.
Yeah.
God, yeah. Which one of them?
You know, that douchebag
in the suspenders.
- Jerry, I think?
- Yeah.
Monday and Jerry argued
just before she left the bar.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(scoffs)</font></b>
He's onto us.
- I knew it.
- Fucking dick sold us out.
Then why aren't we listed?
You've got to corner him, Tuesday.
- Find out what he knows.
- Are you nuts?
He could be the last person
who saw Monday.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b>
- He's our only lead.
- Yeah, okay.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(suspenseful music playing)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(woman)</font></b>
Miss Settman.
Yes?
Step into the van, please.
Is there a problem?
I don't understand. Who are you?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(suspenseful music playing)</font></b>
Step into the fucking van.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(beeping)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(beeping)</font></b>
Wha...?
That's weird. I lost her.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(beeping continues)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(suspenseful music playing)</font></b>
There's obviously been a mistake.
Can you please tell me
what I'm doing here?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(woman)</font></b>
Miss Settman.
What a pleasure to meet you.
Nicolette Cayman.
I know who you are. Uh...
Can you please tell me why I'm here?
You poor child.
I am amazed you made it this far.
This is... This is all a big mistake.
Seven children.
What was your grandfather thinking?
Do you have any idea
how much food and water
was taken out of others' mouths
so you could be here today?
If everyone were as cruel and selfish
as Terrence Settman,
the world would end tomorrow.
I am an only child.
For your sake, I wish that were true.
There are five of them left.
All the rotten eggs in one basket.
- Is there another way?
- Not if you want to keep it quiet.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(muttering)</font></b>
What are you doing? Um...
<b><font color="#ffff00">(breathing heavily)</font></b>
I-I work in a bank!
I can get you money! Please! Please!
We can make some kind of deal! Please!
Funny.
That's what the last one said.
No, wait! No! No, please, no!
No, no, no, no!

It's okay. Look at me.
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.
You're gonna be okay.
I'm here. It's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
No. You're Sunday.
You're supposed to be the believer.
I don't know what I believe.
I don't...
I don't know who I am.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(crying)</font></b>
No!
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sobbing)</font></b>
No! No!
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sobbing)</font></b>
No!
Goddamn it!
<b><font color="#ffff00">(Cayman)</font></b>
They won't suffer.
- Excuse me?
- I'm assured of that.
Um...
We may have a containment problem.
We still haven't heard back
from the Settman team.
Last night, I dreamed this whole building
erupted and spewed out all the siblings.
There were so many of them.
A sea of little bodies...
scorched by flames.
I know what you feel for these children.
But this is on their parents, not you.
Sometimes, I think, "To hell with it."
To hell with everybody.
Humans will never learn.
You're our last chance, Dr. Cayman.
Our only hope.
I need you, Joe. Be careful.
Do not underestimate the Settmans.
If we officially list them,
they'll be flagged at the first checkpoint
and processed within hours.
Seven siblings surviving to adulthood?
It would destroy my credibility. No.
We have to keep this localized.
They are trapped inside that apartment
and they know it.
Besides... we have another issue.
A complication.
Make that a priority.
Then deal with the Settmans.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(retches, coughs)</font></b>

It's Tuesday's.

<b><font color="#ffff00">(clock chimes)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(mutters)</font></b>
What the fuck are we doing? Huh?
We gotta get out of here now.
They know about us.
They're gonna send more people.
Let them come. I'll fucking kill them all.
Calm down.
Just think for a second.
Four of us out there at once?
With all the Bureau agents
and checkpoints and sensors?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(scoffs)</font></b>
We won't last for two minutes.
We always work best as a team...
in an environment we can control.
Those guys, they weren't Bureau.
Or we'd be listed by now, and this place
would be crawling with agents.
Somebody wants us to disappear.
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(whirring)</font></b>
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(breathing heavily)</font></b>
The question is why.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(dings, buzzes)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(scoffs)</font></b>
Fuck it.
Every Wednesday,
I wear a stupid dress and high heels.
Not today.
- What's that?
- Something I wish I thought of yesterday.
I customized it,
so we'll see and hear everything you do.
It's a user-locked grip.
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(weapon beeps)</font></b>
- Can you unlock it?
If I had more time.
For now, it's not gonna fire.
- Doesn't make it any less intimidating.
- This isn't a game, Wednesday.
Go to Jerry's. Find out what he knows.
Don't lose your head out there.
I won't.
Cryosleep. Awake to a better world.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(doorbell ringing)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(thunder rumbling)</font></b>
Hello, Karen.
You're cutting it close. Aren't you?
Please.
Rough night?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
Well, I did say you had
until this morning,
and it's still morning, I guess,
technically, so...
<b><font color="#ffff00">(thunder rumbling)</font></b>
What's it gonna be?
What's what gonna be?
Do we have a deal or not?
Deal...
What deal?
Playing dumb doesn't suit ya, Settman.
This is very simple.
You pass on the promotion.
It goes to me.
And I keep my mouth shut
about your little secret.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(thunder rumbling)</font></b>
You motherfucker!
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(scoffs)</font></b>
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
How long have you known?
- Huh?
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles nervously)</font></b>
You should be glad it was me
who found that contract,
or you'd be in jail by now.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(Wednesday)</font></b>
What contract?
- Are you serious?
- What fucking contract?
407-C funds transfer.
Your contract with Cayman.
Cayman.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(thunder rumbling)</font></b>
Nicolette Cayman.
Yeah. Your new VIP client.
Do you guys know about this?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
Wow.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
This, um... This contract, wh...
where is it?
On my tablet.
Show it to me.
Yeah.

- <b><font color="#ffff00">(glass shattering)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(gasps)</font></b>
Get out of there!

- Going in. Hold position.
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(siren wailing)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(suspenseful music playing)</font></b>
Guys? You there?
Which way? Where do I go?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(suspenseful music playing)</font></b>
Best option is front door.
- Spread out.
- That's not an option.

Do you need backup?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(weapon beeping, whirring)</font></b>
Guess so.
Move it! Take the sibling down.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(thunder rumbling)</font></b>
Girls? I need a way out, now.
There, a dumpster,
below the bedroom window.
- Come on.
- It's a three-story drop,
but the trash will soften the impact.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(computer dings)</font></b>
You better be right, sis.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(metal clanging)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(wheezing, groaning)</font></b>
Fuck!
It's empty.
The trash collection
is every Wednesday morning. Sorry.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(groans)</font></b>
Are you okay?
- Can you run?
- I think so.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(grunting)</font></b>
Then run.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(suspenseful music playing)</font></b>
Go, go, go!
Guys, where am I going?
Next left. There's a door
at the end of the alley.

We need to get you on the roof.

- I thought you said we're not listed.
- We're not.
- Then what the fuck is he doing here?
- Friday? Friday!
<b><font color="#ffff00">(knocking continues)</font></b>
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!
- What are you gonna do?
- Find out what he wants.
And get rid of him.
I got this.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(man knocking)</font></b>
Hey, open up!
<b><font color="#ffff00">(suspenseful music playing)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
- Hey.
- Hey.
New look?
Y-Yeah.
Yeah, I wanted to, um...
try something new.
Nice.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
Um, I called your... your office.
They said you were out sick.
I know. I know I'm not supposed to call,
- but when I saw you at the Bureau, I was...
- The... The Bureau?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I had to go and, um...
drop off some stuff.
Boring bank stuff.
Aren't you going to invite me in?
I was only joking about the forced entry.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(both chuckle)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(Wednesday)</font></b>
Friday?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(whispering)</font></b>
Hold on. We've got a situation.
You've got a situation?

Friday? You there?

Who the fuck is this guy?

Please don't do that.
What?
Are you... Are you serious?
Sorry, I thought you liked
that stuff. I'm...
Just, um...
Just... give me a sec.
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(mouthing words)</font></b>
- What the hell is going on?
- You tell me. Who is that guy?
Don't bullshit me.
Have you been seeing him?
What? No.
He's a Bureau agent.
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?
- You two seemed very familiar.
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(scoffs)</font></b> It's called acting.
How do I know you're not acting now
and you've been seeing him all along?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b>
I've never seen him in my life,
I swear to God.
You need to... to get him
to take you to his place
and find out which one of us
he's been seeing.
- What?
- Yeah, find out what he knows.
Have you lost it completely?
You want me to go with him?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(beeps)</font></b>
- Yeah.
- I think he wants to fuck me.
Well, no shit.
- Show me your bracelet.
- Why?
It's a coupling device
from the dead guy's bracelet.
All you need to do
is get yours close to his.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(muttering)</font></b>
Wait. What?
Just activate your bracelet
and connect it to that guy's,
and we get a gateway
into the Bureau's servers.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b>
What if he catches me?
Well, I'm sure you know
a few tricks to distract him.
Well, I don't know any tricks.
What do you mean?
All your big talk...
You've never been with anyone?
I'll be right there!
Oh, God! Wednesday!
Oh, shit!
- We're back.
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(Wednesday)</font></b> About time.
- <b><font color="#ffff00">(computer dings)</font></b>
- There's, uh, roof access.
The last door, southwest corner.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(suspenseful music playing)</font></b>
Guys...
There is no way I can clear this.
There's only two ways
out of this, Wednesday.
You make that jump or you catch a bullet.
At least, this way, you stand a chance.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(thunder rumbling)</font></b>
You've been training for this
your whole life.
You can do it.

The file from Wednesday.
It's a 407-C funds transfer,
just like Jerry said.
Why would Karen Settman
illegally transfer millions of euros
into Nicolette Cayman's campaign fund?
This contract was executed the same day
as we got our promotion.
A transfer that big...
Hm...
Karen Settman really needed
that promotion.

- <b><font color="#ffff00">(moans)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b>
I gotta go.
There's this big event
at the Bureau tonight.
Cayman's starting her push for Parliament.
Why are you working for them?
The Bureau? Why not?
Well, couldn't you get another job?
Why would I want another job?
Don't you think it's wrong
to be rounding up siblings?
Have you ever set foot
in the lower sectors?
I mean, most of these kids
that we pick up,
they live in really shitty conditions.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
Trust me, we're doing them a favor.
By sending them off to the cryobank?
Yeah. For now.
Until we see better days.
See you later?
I have some... work stuff to catch up on.
- Let's meet on our usual day.
- We talked about this, right?
I just wanna be with you every day.
Not just Monday.
See you, babe.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(door opens)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(door closes)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(indistinct chatter)</font></b>
So, Monday's been seeing Adrian
for months.
Miss Perfect likes
to be choked during sex.
Can you believe it?
Cayman is holding her hostage.
What? Monday's alive?
Yeah.
Be careful, Saturday.
This Bureau agent could be playing us.
I... I don't know.
I don't think so. I'm scared, Thursday.
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna get through this.
Every day we set foot outside,
we beat the odds.
We're gonna get Monday out,
and we're gonna show the world
who Cayman really is.

Okay.

Go and get Monday.
Show Cayman
who Karen Settman really is.
What are you talking about?
Please, there's still time!
It's okay. I'm not like the rest of you.
As crazy and dysfunctional

Where's Karen?

What happened to Monday?
Ah...
Karen.
How are you enjoying your stay?
I trust we've made you comfortable.
More than comfortable.
We failed miserably
as a species on this planet.
Masterminding our own extinction.
But, through it all, through your donation
and my push for Parliament,
we might just still have another chance.
Take your wig off.
Take it off!
<b><font color="#ffff00">(plastic rustling)</font></b>
If you're beginning
to have second thoughts,
you should know that I've kept
one of your siblings alive as collateral.
And, after all...
anyone who's willing to sacrifice
their own flesh and blood...
can never be fully trusted.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(dings)</font></b>
So...
how does it feel to be the one
and only Karen Settman?

- Let's take this bitch down.

Monday.
I'm impressed.
You've never worn
Karen Settman so well.
- You think you own her. You don't.
- I do her justice.
You only pretend.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(beeps)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(beeping)</font></b>
Thank you for coming this evening.
I'm deeply honored and grateful.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(applause)</font></b>
I gotta get to Cayman.
Get her away from the servers.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(grunts)</font></b>

You sold us out.
How could you?
I thought you, of all people,
would understand.
Understand? We were your family.
What do you know about family?
All these years of endless lectures
on responsibility and sacrifice?
I never saw you do any of it, not once.
I did everything I was told.
Everything right.
I did everything I could
to protect our family.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(scoffs)</font></b>
You have a funny way of showing it.
Sunday died in my arms.
Wednesday fell to her death.
Saturday was shot in the head,
and Friday...
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sighs)</font></b>
I didn't plan this.
I met Adrian and I fell in love.
And things changed.
I made a deal with Cayman, and...
<b><font color="#ffff00">(stammers)</font></b> it got out of my control.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you...
you lost your finger because of me.
I was a... I was a total fuck-up.
If I could go back
and change it all, I would.
Karen Settman...
was so much more than any one of us.
She was all of us.
She was our family.

I was the firstborn.
Karen Settman was always mine.
The rest of you?
You were just afterbirth.
For three decades,
the Child Allocation Bureau has combatted
the most serious crisis
our world has ever faced.
Catastrophic overpopulation.
Critics may chastise our methods,
but the numbers don't lie.

<b><font color="#ffff00">(rapid beeping)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(grunting)</font></b>
In a perfect world,
every child has the right to live.
That's why I'm running for office.
So I can reform the law.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(groans)</font></b>
Anyone who wants to bring a child
into this world
must be able to prove
financial stability...
and be able to guarantee
the emotional and physical
well-being of that child.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(weapon beeping, whirring)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(grunting)</font></b>
There may even be room for siblings...
if the data measures up.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(neck cracks)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(grunts)</font></b>
So I commend you for your vision
as we continue to take positive action
to build a sustainable future
full of hope and possibility.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(weapon fires)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(both grunting)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(groaning)</font></b>
Together...
we will...
<b><font color="#ffff00">(screams)</font></b>
survive.

Are you okay?
<b><font color="#ffff00">(whistling)</font></b>
Hit it.

They didn't suffer.
No, they didn't suffer.
They didn't suffer. They didn't suffer!
<b><font color="#ffff00">(Cayman sobbing)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(grunting)</font></b>
What have you done?

Monday.
I need you to be brave.
Set an example for your sisters.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(screaming)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(Terrence sobbing)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(sobbing continues)</font></b>
I'm just trying to protect you.
I'm so sorry.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(cries)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(crying)</font></b>
Promise me...
Don't let them take them.
Don't let them take them.
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.
Stay with me, okay?
Oh...
Baby, you're okay. Baby. Baby.
Federation-wide rioting has forced
the repeal of the Child Allocation Act.
Hundreds of siblings held
in processing centers have been released.
Pregnant women
are coming out of hiding in droves,
the majority from poorest districts.
Without this repeal,
many of these children would
have been discarded or processed
the minute they were born.

This planet is the only home
you will ever know.
So, look around.
Ask yourselves.
Who will continue to make
the difficult decisions
that will ensure your survival?
My regret...
My regret is that your children
will never know
the world we could have built together.
That hope is gone forever.
I like your new eye, Tuesday.
- They did a good job.
- Thank you.
Oh, it's not Tuesday anymore. It's Terry.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
Okay. Terry.
So...
what should I call you?
Karen.
Karen Settman.
<b><font color="#ffff00">(chuckles)</font></b>
<b><font color="#ffff00">(Terry)</font></b>
Monday did it all for them.
She wanted them to be safe.
Well...
they will be.
