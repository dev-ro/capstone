MICROCOSMOS
A meadow in early morning
somewhere on earth.
Hidden here is the world 
as wast as our own
where the weeds are like 
inpenetrable jungles,
stones are mountains,
and even the smallest pond 
becomes an ocean
Time passes differently here,
an hour is like a day,
a day is like a season,
and the passing of a season is a lifetime.
But to observe this world...
...we must fall silent now...
...and listen to its murmurs.
