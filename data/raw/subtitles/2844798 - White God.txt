"Everything terrible is something 
that needs our love."
R. M. Rilke
White God
Hagen, let it go. It isn't yours.
Good dog!
Lili!
Lili, hurry up. I'm running out of time.
- How long will the flight take?
- A day.
- Where will the plane land?
- In Sydney.
- And then what?
- We'll travel by car.
Do not tear it up.
Fit for consumption.
Professor, take this.
- It's not necessary.
- For your daughter.
I'm no longer a professor.
- See you next week.
- Alright.
- Will you stay by the sea for 3 months?
- The ocean. Australia is near the ocean.
- Is it far from university?
- 200 meters.
- How fortunate!
- It'll be alright with dad.
You got her passport?
- Here.
- Thanks.
Finally! Is that him?
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.
I got it.
- Will you be back for the concert?
- how would that be possible?
- Take care of them.
- Them?
She brought her dog.
- I don't want a dog.
- What was I supposed to do?
- The professor can take care of him.
- You mean Hans?
He's going to the conference as well.
Are you climbing the ladder?
- Don't do this to me.
- Not again.
Come  here, sweetie. I have to go.
Listen to your dad, okay?
Those three months will be over in no time.
Take care of yourself.
Don't I get a kiss?
- I got something for you.
- What is it?
To blow bubbles.
Thanks, but I'm no longer a child.
- What's that around your neck?
- An access card.
Can I have it?
Are you chewing gum?
 Spit it out.
Twenty.
Punch in the code, 1965.
- What's that stray dog doing here?
- Hagen.
- Do you want to keep him here?
- Yes, for now.
For how long?
He can't stay here.
There are rules.
Stray dogs have to be reported...
-... and registered.
- I did not know.
- Read the rules. He'll have to be reported.
- I'll take care of it. Thanks.
Dirty pig!
This is yours.
Good dog!
Lili, leave the dog alone.
In here at least.
- What will you do with that?
- What should I do with it?
- Why don't you put it where it belongs?
- Where is that?
You need to ask. Give it to me.
Lili, it belongs here. Okay?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
You have to eat whatever's available.
The dog will eat the dog's food.
Now go and eat.
I told you I'm not hungry.
Fine, then go to bed.
Take the dog away.
- Put on your pajamas.
- Turn around.
Okay.
- Which bed do you want, Lili?
- The same one Hagen has.
Hagen will not sleep in this room.
- Why not?
- Because he's a dog.
I won't sleep next to a dog.
Get out!
Get out.
Get out and stay there.
Lay down!
When will he quit?
He's not used to sleeping alone.
I can't sleep.
- Where are you going?
- I need to pee.
Don't pay any attention to him.
He'll quit eventually .
Stay here, please.
I'm sorry.
Good night.
Me too, I love you.
What is it, Hagen?
Why are you in such a rush?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- We have received a call.
- A call?
Dog control. It's about the dog.
Excuse me?
- Your dog has bitten someone.
- I don't have a dog.
What's that then?
It's an elephant. Can't you see?
It's a stray dog, mixed race,
not a Hungarian race. You'll have to pay.
- Cash or check?
- I never had a dog.
This dog belongs to my ex-wife.
I'm not gonna pay anything.
My ex does not live here.
And neither does her dog or his fleas.
There's a special tax for bastards.
- And what if I don't pay?
- You'll need to take him to a dog shelter.
- Today.
- Yes.
Next time he will be gone.
- No problem.
- He's not registered.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.
Get dressed.
I'll take a shower and then I'll take him away.
Hagen, come. Come here.
Let's go.
Come.
Get down.
Sit..Sit.
Down.
Sit.
Sit.. Stay.. Stay.
Down.
Sit.. Sit.. Sit.. Stay.
I would never do that to you.
Hey, calm down.
Don't eat me.
Come. Come, Hagen.
Be quiet. You'll have to stay here.
Don't be afraid. I will be over there.
Good dog!
Hello everybody.
Can we start?
- A bit faster.
- I bet he'll start barking.
- No way.
- Wanna bet?
- He won't bark.
- And what if he will?
- He won't bark.
- It's your problem.
Misi.
Misi!
Why are you going faster?
Stop!
David, go practice at home, not here.
Stop laughing!
What's so funny?
We'll continue with 36.
Stop. Stop it!
Whose dog is this?
Whose dog is this? Well?
Whose dog is this?
He's mine.
Get him out of here. Now!
- Hagen, let's go.
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Where are you going? Racz!
You stay here!
If you leave, don't bother coming back! 
Do you hear me?
Racz!
Come back!
You're suspended!
What are you looking at!
Don't lick me. I'm not in the mood.
Great. Just what we needed.
What are you doing?
I've been looking for hours.
I almost called the police.
- What's the problem?
- Are you out of your mind?
- Come on, get in.
- Come on.
You're running away because of the damn dog!
Come on!
Who do you think you are?
You took this animal to school?
- I don't want him taken to a shelter.
- I'm not gonna pay for him.
- He's not going to a shelter.
- This dog will not enter the apartment anymore.
- You almost slept on the streets 'cause of him.
- So what?
Do you think you're the Queen of England?
- Who do you think you are?
- Not the Queen of England.
Shut up!
- He's not going to the shelter.
- You have no choice, missy.
Don't you get it, I'll never do that!
Find him a home.
Noone wants a smelly stray dog.
That's what the shelter's for.
He won't go to a shelter. Get it?
I can't understand why you won't pay.
- They'll kill him.
- What do you want?
Do you want me to throw him out?
Here, out on the streets?
Is that what you want? Well?
Is that what you want?
Really?
I'd prefer that.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What am I doing? 
I'm doing what you wished for!
- Do you want me to take him to a shelter?
- No!
- Come here!
- Hagen, stay!
I'll be back! Hagen!
Hagen, stay! I'll be back!
Stop! Do you hear me?
Dad, you're an asshole. I want to get out.
- Are you deaf?
- Shut up!
He'll get hit! I want to get out!
Get on the sidewalk, you idiot!
- I want to get out!
- Shut up!
I want to get out! Seriously.
Lili, what are you doing ?
- I'm hungry.
- Show me.
Raw meat, like a dog?
- Why do you care about what I eat?
- Do you want to get ill?
- So what?
- Why do you want to get ill?
'Cause you're a jerk.
- Go to bed!
- I'm gonna look for him.
- Will that be alright?
- Yeah, half.
Fine.
Do you want me to wrap it up?
Damn it! Get out, all of you!
Get here, you flea-bag, I'll cut you in half.
C'mon doggy..
Where are you, stray dog?
I will eat you!
Damn dogs!
Get the catchers.
We're gonna catch them all.
Okay, get them.
There are two of  'em up there.
Have you seen a big dog?
- That way.
- Thanks.
There he is!
Come. Get over here.
He has a leash.
His name should be on it.
- He's not hostile.
- What?
He's licking my hand.
He's not hostile.
- He doesn't understand what we're doing.
- He'll find out soon enough.
Damn it!
Two others.
Here?
You'll be working for me.
We're alll hungry dogs, damn it.
Shit.
Watch this.
I'll show you who's boss.
Don't make a scene.
- Lili, apologize and sit down.
- My apologies.
No doubt Lili can explain why she brought the animal.
I took him because he couldn't stay at home.
Why not?
We don't want a dog like that.
And why don't you want a dog like that?
- He bit my dad.
- What?
He bit my dad.
Did you take him to the shelter?
- No, he ran off.
- I can't hear you.
He ran off.
- So we won't see him again.
- Do you think so?
Stop with the attitude, girl.
Answer me.
- Will he come back?
- No.
- Can I come back?
- If you behave.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
It's not a problem.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Are you okay?
- Can Lili watch Tannhäuser?
- If she wants to.
Do you want to?
Let's continue with 147.
Attention!
Hagen!
What is she doing here?
Look who's there.
- Little bitch.
- Damn it...
Let's go inside.
- Did you not go to Tannhäuser either?
- No, I've been driving around.
- Did you find your bastard?
- Mixed race.
- Do you want me to help looking?
- Leave her alone.
- It's cold. Will you come with me?
- Let me finish this cigarette.
- Where have you been?
- Everywhere.
- Have you taped a lot of them?
- Yeah.
- Can I have a hit?
- You don't smoke.
- Yes I do.
- No, you don't.
Dry your hair.
Look at the stars.
If they don't fall, you'll get over it.
Thanks.
-  Tannhäuser, what is it?
- What?
Tannhäuser, what is it about?
About love, I guess.
Don't get addicted to nicotine.
See you.
- I don't want to see you anymore.
- Salaam-Alaikum.
Get out. What are you doing here?
Do you see this big, bad dog?
He can knock the world out.
It's yours for 8000 forint.
- It's worthless.
- Worthless? My ass!
I'll give you a plate of food, okay?
- 6000.
- A plate of food, I said.
- 4000.
- A plate of food, I said.
- 2000.
- 2000 and a plate of food.
Deal.
Hand him a plate of food and bring the chain.
And don't show your face in here again.
Get it?
- I don't want anything to do with you.
- Alright.
Okay.
Take this dog to the back.
These dirty stray dogs have been here for three weeks.
The tiny white one has a ripped ear.
He's a fighter.
He's worth it.
I don't care about looks.
I wanna see for myself.
Or the black one.
he was brought in by some Roma kids.
I paid 100.000.
The bastard crapped all over the place.
His arse was on fire.
I gave him pills.
And he turned them into hard turds.
He doesn't eat, the fool.
I paid 300.000 for the brown one.
I want at least 500.000.
- I want this one.
- What?
Did you go nuts in jail or what?
It's a lap dog.
I want him. How much?
Can you see the skin around the neck?
It's looking good.
Don't bother. How much?
- 150. I'll sell the tiny black one for 200.
- I want this one.
No problem.
And ten more.
Come. Come here.
You still have faith.
Go to sleep.
Yes, that's right.
Eat.
That's right. Eat.
Tastes good, huh? It's your new food.
It's okay.
Challenger.
Next fight.
I am disappointed to find out,
that few of you have bothered to show up.
I assume you already know the opera.
You can undoubtedly tell me
what Tannhäuser is about.
Peter?
Schiller, wipe that smirk off your face.
Beatrix?
Trixie.
Take off that lipstick.
A trumpeter can't have that.
So what is Tannhäuser about?
Lili?
- Who cares.
- Excuse me?
Are you teaching us to lie or to make music?
Tannhäuser  is about love.
You wouldn't know 'cause you have no heart.
Stop it!
Get out, all of you.
Ga.
Lili, you stay.
Go on.
Stretch.
Again.
Great.
You can play on my funeral.
I knew you could do it.
You're gonna do it.
Hello?
- You're not allowed to enter.
- Is this the shelter?
- It's not the day of adoption.
- Can I see if my dog is in there?
- Why? Where is he?
- I don't know.
- He'll be there where you left him.
- He's missing.
- Missing?
- Yes.
Alright, get over here.
- Don't lie to me.
- My dad threw him out.
And surely you assisted him?
So what story is it?
Here.
Can I see if he's here?
I can't see properly without my glasses.
- Is it a Labrador or a Sharpei?
- It's a mixed race.
Ah, of course. Not a proper breed.
Obviously you took him out with the garbage.
- When did he go missing?
- A couple of weeks ago.
So you have no dog anymore.
If that is correct, then there is no hope.
He is gone, hit by a car,
or he got drowned in the Danube.
- Or you killed him.
- No, people tell lies.
- We do not kill them here.
- You killed him.
That's my bike!
- What are you doing here?
- I have a fighter.
- Get out.
- I got the dough.
- Where'd you come up with that?
- I sucked cocks, just like you.
- Piss off.
- Tell him I'm here.
- I'll ask.
- Come on, Max.
Come here.
Hi.
I told you not to do it.
He's dead.
Hi.
1000 Euros.
Did you win the lottery?
It's all there.
Follow me.
Come on.
- You couldn't get a bigger dog?
- You know nothing of dogs. This one's a winner.
- That's not a dog.
- No way he'll survive.
Get him!
Harder!
Enough. Separate 'em.
get his neck!
Stop! It's over.
Enough!
I won!
We made it! Did you see that?
I'm back. Give me my money.
We pulled it off, Maxi!
- How much for the dog?
- He's not for sale.
- Everything has a price.
- Yeah, of course.
Just not for you. You screwed me.
And now you want something from me?
I don't want you. I want the dog.
- He'll work for us.
- I'll go somewhere else.
I will not allow that.
- Turn on the lights!
- Calm down!
Do you take me for a fool?
Maxi!
Calm down, stop yelling.
What did you do with my dog?
- Shut up.
- Maxi!
Hear the gypsy bark!
Where did you take him?
- What did you do?
- Shut up!
- Where are you going?
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing. I'm going to a party.
- Can I come with you?
- What?
- Can I come with you?
I need to do something first.
- How much?
- One.
- What happened?
- My dad's an asshole.
- Too bad.
- Can I come with you?
- I'll take you home.
- Am I embarrassing you?
- It's not that.
- Then take me with you.
- Keep this with you.
- What is it?
Your entrance ticket.
Okay?
Hold me tight.
I won't bite.
Let's go.
Give me your hand. We're a couple.
Raise your arms.
- You can go.
- Thanks.
- Hey!
- Hello.
Hi!
- Wanna dance?
- Let's go.
Lili, will you come with us?
Don't you want to have this?
Just hold on to that for a little longer.
- You smell nice. What is it?
- Ed Hardy.
- What?
- Ed Hardy.
Can I have my sweater?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What do you have there?
- Nothing.
Empty your pockets!
- I got nothing.
- Come on.
Follow me.
Can I see your ID?
Thank you.
Good morning.
There he is.
Good morning. Is this your daughter?
Yes, she's my daughter.
- The drug test was negative.
- You can take her home.
From now on, keep an eye on her.
- Congratulations, little girl.
- What?
Let's shake hands.
This is just marvelous.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's hard to lose someone you love.
Sometimes things don't go as planned.
You're no longer a kid.
- We'll go to the shelter and get another dog.
- I don't want a dog.
Why not?
Let's go home.
- How long did I sleep?
- There's plenty of time to sleep.
- What are we gonna do today?
- Laundry.
And then?
Whatever you like.
- Are you hung over?
- No, I'm just thirsty.
- Shouldn't you be working today?
- Yes I should.
- Well?
- Who will look after you?
Don't worry about me.
- I don't want to leave you alone.
- Why not?
- Because you'll have to look after yourself.
- Why not?
Don't ask me that.
Go. I'll be fine.
- You won't run away?
- No.
- Promised?
- Yes.
See you soon.
Black, brown, big ones...
All of them bastards, mongrels.
Bitch!
What's wrong with his paw?
- Show me.
- Show her.
A nasty wound.
Nobody will take him.
He can't stay. Put him aside.
It won't hurt.
See? It's been taken care of.
There won't be any enemies where you're going.
Nobody will hurt you anymore.
That's no lie. It is the truth.
Get the bag. Was this the last one?
Yes, the others are as usual.
- See you later.
- See you.
Youn look wonderful.
- Are you nervous?
- A little.
- Why?
- 'Cause I'll mess up.
No, you'll be the best.
- Come in.
- Choose the one you'd like to have.
There are white ones as well.
- What happened?
- He bit me.
- He bit you?
- Yes.
Are you insane?
You can't bite. It's over.
You're done with.
Get back!
Get back!
This is not allowed! You hear me?
Drop that! It's mine!
Go away!
Sit down, please.
Stay away from the doors!
Don't panic!
Stay quiet! Call the police.
Who has a phone?
Stay quiet! Sit down!
Don't go! Sit down!
You can't go there. They're mad.
- They're here because of me.
- Stay here.
- Hagen's there as well.
- It's dangerous.
- So what?
- Don't go. Damn it!
Come here. Come in.
Don't go down there!
They went down there!
- Wild beasts!
- You're the beast.
Don't go outside!
The city is on lock down!
Everything is closed!
You can go this way.
Quickly, they are here.
- Can you see Hagen?
- No.
Take my bike.
I'm sorry about the other day.
Forget it.
What is it, Max?
What is it? Why are you back?
You're a champ.
Max, what are you waiting for? Come here.
Come here. Do you hear me?
Max, what is it you want?
What's the problem? Get over here.
Come.
Here. Why are you not moving?
Did you see anything?
Do you know what happened?
Come here. We'll take you home.
We're gonna lock the place down.
What are you doing here?
Have you lost your tongue?
Don't be afraid. They're escaped animals.
We'll catch them in the morning.
Come on, let's go.
- Are you going to kill them?
- Of course. Let's go.
Watch your head.
The dogs were spotted in the marketplace.
Patrol 2 to Base. We're stuck at the station. Over.
This is 11 responding.
We have a suspect. Over.
Base, affirmative.
The dogs were spotted in the marketplace.
Hagen!
- Daddy.
- Finally! Where are you?
- There's blood everywhere.
- Where are you?
- They haven't come for the meat.
- What?
They will all be killed in the morning.
- I'm going to look for Hagen.
- There's a curfew.
- Tell me where you are!
- I need to find Hagen.
Where are you? Answer me.
Don't hang up!
- Lili, answer me!
- I have to go.
The biggest shelter in the city
has turned into a battlefield.
Hundreds of dogs escaped
and killed employees.
The most frightening thing was, 
the dogs didn't behave like animals...
... they operated like an army instead.
The authorities have started the hunt
and request everyone to stay inside.
The dogs are very dangerous.
Max!
Come back! Stop! Come back!
Don't go! Come back!
No!
Professor...
Professor?
Are you asleep?
Professor...
Get ready!
The other side. Quickly!
Lie down! Damn it!
Dad.
Dad.
Finally! Where were you?
I was looking for Hagen. You're in danger!
- It's a chaos.
- Get inside. Use the front door.
I'll open the door.
Quickly!
My god!
Wake up. 
I have to go to the slaughterhouse.
My card won't let me pass.
Give me yours.
- Okay.
- They've gone insane.
- Who?
- The dogs are here.
Come on, get up.
Hagen.
What have you done?
What's going on?
Look.
Good dog! Catch!
Why are you looking at me like that?
Fetch the stick!
Quickly.
Open up!
Open up!
Help!
Open up!
Daddy!
Hagen, what are you doing? Be calm.
Daddy!
Hagen, it's me.
I'ts me, Hagen.
- Go away!
- Stop it, dad!
- Get behind me!
- Stop it!
That's enough! Stop it!
Shall I call the police?
Hang on.
