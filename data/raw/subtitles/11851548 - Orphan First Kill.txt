I'm Anna Troyev,
the art therapy instructor.
Arms up.
I trust we won't go
through this every day.
Anna?
Welcome.
Are you ready for
your first day?
I think so.
Please.
Do you live far?
Somewhat, but it's worth it.
I've always wanted to
use art to help people.
Wonderful.
Please.
This way.
Those are our
security procedures.
Learn them backwards
and forwards.
Most of our patients are
quite docile, but others..
Doctor, it's Leena.
She's not in her room,
nobody can find her.
Lock it.
Full on lock out!
Who is Leena?
Our most dangerous patient.
In fact, she's the reason
for the opening you're filling.
Your predecessor underestimated
her and ignored protocol.
It did not end well.
Listen to me.
Do not leave this room.
Don't worry, you'll be safe here
and I'll come back after
we found her.
Please, please.
Hello there.
Does your mom or dad work here?
Could I see?
Is that me?
That's very good.
I'm Anna.
What's your name?
Leena.
You didn't a-answer me before.
Do your parents work here?
Why would you think that?
- Because you're..
- I'm what?
Leena..
Put it down.
Leena, put it down now.
You didn't tell me
she was a child.
It's because she's not.
Leena suffers
from a gland disorder.
Which causes
proportional dwarfism,
essentially halting her
growth around age ten.
Make no mistake, Leena may
look like a child,
but she is a grown woman.
31 to be exact.
When Leena first arrived,
she struggled so hard against
her restraints that she
would bleed severely.
It was a lesson for all of
us on the depths of her
will to be free.
Much of Leena's early life
was spent doing whatever she
could to survive.
But she never grew older, at
least not on the outside.
Imagine, going through
your whole life
with the world only
seeing a child.
It is very important that you
do not see her in that way.
Leena uses her affliction as
much as she suffers from it.
She's an exceptional con artist.
Two years ago, Leena wormed
her way into this family
by posing as a runaway.
This family took her in, they
fed her, they clothed her.
Normally, Leena would simply
steal whatever she could and
disappear, but this time she...
Well, let me put it this
way, she lives here now.
Idti.
Idti!
She does that.
How much longer we got, daddy?
You have a few minutes, darling.
You learning me by
heart little Sara?
No, daddy, I know you by heart.
You're inside my heart.
We're going to be
brave, aren't we?
Yes, daddy.
But this is gonna
be our hardest battle.
Leena; Hello, Dmitri.
You're on time.
It's perfect.
I can't tie these myself.
I want to do
something nice for you.
You can come in.
Yeah. Yeah.
I can do it now.
Any moment I may see, my
daddy coming back to me.
I don't.
My daddy has to go away.
Idti.
Do you want some candy?
Idti!
She cut the feed.
I'm so sorry, Anna.
Hopefully, the police will find
her before anyone else is hurt.
Not quite the start we'd
hoped for, I'm sure.
This job isn't for me.
Oh, Anna.
It usually takes only one.
Who's there?
Don't be afraid, I'm police.
Don't be afraid, I'm police.
Uh... Where are your parents?
My parents are in America.
Sweetheart, what is your name?
My name is Esther.
- You killed it.
- Thanks, man.
Proud of you, sweetheart.
Yeah, great job, pal.
Thanks, guys.
How long do you think you'll be?
Actually a bunch of people are
getting together tonight.
Well, congrats.
I'll see you guys
back at the house.
I mean, this was
supposed to be family night.
What, is he not supposed
to have fun with friends?
Oh God, all he does is have fun.
No.
Gunnar works his tail off.
When he's not studying,
he's fencing.
He's living his life.
Don't do that,
don't go into your head.
I need you to be present.
Gunnar needs you.
Oh, sorry, was I
not at that match?
Esther's not coming back, Allen.
I miss her too.
I do.
Every moment of every day.
What's he doing here?
From the little we've
gotten from Esther,
we believe a woman
abducted her, brought her to
Russia and passed her off as
her own child until Esther
managed to escape.
We haven't gotten
many specifics yet.
Perhaps when she's feeling
safer, she can shed some more
light on what
she's been through.
We have a child therapist
that she'll be working with.
Good.
But what she needs
right now is her family.
Be prepared for changes.
Four years is a long time
in the development of a child.
Esther?
Sweetheart, it's me, it's mommy.
Can I, can I see you?
Sweetie.
It's mommy.
I thought I'd
never see you again.
Everything is right now.
It's been so long since
you've seen any of us.
See if I can..
Oh, there's daddy.
This was one of
our charity events.
He looks so handsome that
night, didn't he?
Can I grab you anything else?
- No, thanks.
- Okay.
Oh, speak of the devil, your
brother is probably a foot
taller than you'd remember.
Oh, there's Mup-Mup.
She's been so good to us.
Oh, I can't wait to see her.
No, sweetie.
She passed.
Remember?
It's just the four of us now.
I have to use the restroom.
Ah, is the restroom over there?
No, it's just
right back over there.
Over in the back?
Hm-hm.
- Thank you for your help.
- You're welcome.
I can't wait to see you.
So stupid.
Oh, daddy and Gunnar are
just downstairs.
Do you think father
will recognize me?
Maybe not if you keep
calling him father.
Dad.
Yeah. That's better.
Here, let me look at you.
Oh, my God, you look,
like a little lady.
You've grown up so much.
Take this off.
That's better.
It's less austere.
This is..
Sorry.
No, I-I'm sorry, I..
Come on, let's go.
I think, I'm nervous.
Right, big step.
Daddy.
I'm so sorry, I can't
believe it's really you.
I always knew.
I always knew.
Hello, Gunnar.
Hey.
I think we can do a little
better than "hey,"
don't you think?
Come on.
Glad you're back.
Me too.
How about we go home?
- Yes!
- Let's go home.
Welcome home, Esther.
We left it just as it was.
We always knew you'd
come back home.
I mean you probably outgrown
so much but we have a lot of
Christmases and birthdays to
make up for, so just let us
know what you're into,
and you might get it.
I like painting.
You like to paint?
You were never interested
in painting before.
Well, maybe you two can
spend some time in your studio.
Nothing would make me happier.
So um, the plan is, tomorrow
you're gonna talk to Dr. Segar.
Do you remember her?
She, she had the
parrot named Sydney?
Hm-hm.
Well, if you need anything..
We're be right down the hall.
Alright?
Okay, you can go in.
Dr. Segar will be
right with you.
Dr, Segar: I'm seeing her
in few minutes.
I think it's too soon for you
to get involved, detective.
I'd like to talk
to her alone first.
Look, I have to go.
You have no idea how
happy I am to see you, Esther.
Welcome home.
Well now, you are certainly not
the little girl I once knew.
You're a young lady now.
Do you remember what I told you
when we first began
our sessions?
I told you if I ask any
questions that make you
uncomfortable, we'll stop.
I wish my parents were like you.
How so?
They keep asking
what happened to me,
but I'm not ready to
tell them about it.
And that's perfectly fine.
I am hoping you'll talk
to me about it,
but only when
you're ready, okay?
Having said that, is there
anything you want to tell me
about your time, away..
You want to play, Sydney?
I think Sydney
wants to play with me.
Hello. I remember you.
Do you remember me?
Your turn.
Esther, you can wait out
here, I'm just gonna need to
talk to your mom for a moment.
Hello.
Hi.
I like your earrings.
Oh, thank you, honey.
What are you writing?
Oh! I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It's-it's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna
get this cleaned up.
Does she seem the
same as you remember?
Different?
Well, of course she's different.
She has an accent now.
Is that unusual, considering
where she's been?
Not necessarily,
she was there a long time
when her speech was still
developing.
But I will tell you,
she's in far better shape
intellectually and emotionally
than I would expect.
That's good, right?
I did also notice
some inconsistencies.
For example, she
said that was Sydney.
Sydney was a macaw, bright
orange and four times the size.
Yet, today, she addressed
this bird as Sydney
with complete confidence.
What are you getting at?
To me, it felt
like a performance.
He hit me and ripped my dress!
I want to go home.
That's enough for today.
Of course, we'll reschedule.
Esther, you alright?
Uh, yes.
Hey!
Morticia.
Get Gunnar for me, would you?
What did you call me?
Mike, that's her. The sister?
Oh, shit, it's my bad.
Umm... Get Gunnar.
Pajalsta?
How about I cut your balls off,
and feed them to you,
you fucking shit stain?
Was that Spanish, or something?
I don't.. Hey.
Let's go.
Your sister's a
fucking trip, man.
Seriously, dude, my
dad's right there.
I don't care.
Mike, what the fuck..
I am what I am.
Hey, honey, you okay?
Hm. My dress is ruined.
We'll buy you a new one.
I was thinking, uh,
just thinking
we can go to the studio.
I would love to.
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think you've never
been in here before.
So beautiful.
What's the light for?
What's the light for?
So you don't remember?
This is what your
papa is famous for.
Hmm.
Here.
Press on this.
Yeah, I always try to
fit so much in to one canvas,
you know, So I resorted
to a hidden layer.
Nothing is ever just
one thing, right?
So cool.
You haven't been
in here in a while.
No, I haven't.
What's this one?
Oh, no.
It's, uh, I should
have gotten rid of this.
Who-who is, who is that?
There's no use
dwelling on the past.
You're home now, that's
all that matters, alright?
So I was thinking we could
dust off some canvasses you
know, and see what comes of it.
I'd love to.
Yeah?
Uh, what's your poison?
Oils, watercolors?
I've got it all.
- Charcoal.
- Charcoal.
Okay, pick an object and
we'll sit down
and we'll draw it together.
I want to draw you.
You want to draw me?
Hm-hm.
Yeah, okay.
Well, this is a first.
How do you want me?
I can, I can do the thinker.
The way you were when
you were looking at that.
That's not a place I
want to live anymore.
There, just like that.
You learned to paint
while you were over there?
Mm-hm.
Would you just draw, or was
it, was it also..
It wasn't what you think.
It's still happening
despite everything
that's going on.
Allen?
No, he won't be there.
You know how he feels
about these things.
So I'll see you at the
gala tomorrow then, okay?
It's for good cause.
Beth, just bring your
checkbook and Jim.
It's for pediatric
cancer, for Christ's sake.
Okay, that's better, thank you.
I'm finished.
Allen; Already?
Hm-hm.
Do you like it?
Allen; I love it.
It's-it's incredible.
Okay, thirty seconds, alright?
And then we're gonna see
what you can do with paint.
That's private.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I saw that you brought it
back with you,
I thought it was special.
You don't knock?
I was looking for my gold watch.
It's OK, I'm sure it
will turn up.
Sorry!
Property of Esther.
Mummy took me to Wicked.
Mummy.
Hello, mummy.
Thank you, mummy.
I know, mummy.
Mummy.
Huh! Mummy.
You're not gonna
believe what Esther can do.
We spent the afternoon
in the studio.
She drew a portrait of me.
She's got more talent than
I had when I was in my 20s.
How's that possible?
Four years ago she was
drawing stick figures.
Easy.
What?
Think about where you
were four years ago.
Now you're a fencing champion.
Yeah, just, it's impressive.
Maybe you can make
a portrait of me.
This is delicious, mummy.
Thank you.
Is something wrong?
No, no.
I'm-I'm just..
Were you expecting someone?
Just thought I'd pop
in to say hi to Esther.
Look who came for a visit.
Oh, I'm sorry to
interrupt dinner.
This is, uh, the
police officer who helped us
when you went missing.
He's a friend.
I just came to say
welcome home Esther.
Thank you.
Excuse me for a moment.
You should know, um, our
child psychologist feels
Esther should tell her story
within the confines of a...
And not with a cop like me.
Don't worry, I get it.
But Esther did vanish from
our little town,
and that remains a concern.
I need to know if
there's still a danger.
I spoke to Dr.
Segar this morning.
Is that appropriate?
Donnan; She told me she's
open to a group discussion
tomorrow morning.
Just to see if
everything's alright.
Mummy, your gala is tomorrow.
We'll do it the
following day then.
It's important.
I mean, sure.
If it's that important,
we'll be there.
You forgot to fill your glass.
Well, um, welcome home, Esther.
You said that already.
Now, Esther.
Oh, it's okay, she's right.
I'll walk you out.
I'm sorry you live here.
You know.. I think
I'll stay here
for a while.
I think something's
going on with Dr. Segar.
She seemed to be implying
in our last meeting
that Esther is lying.
That's insane.
Maybe she needs to
see a therapist.
I know, right?
What... what is this?
Your date.
You're coming?
Yeah, of course, I'm coming.
You're my wife.
I can deal with a few
rich pricks for you.
What about Esther?
Well, Gunnar's here.
She'll be fine. Right?
What? Do you want
me to stay home?
No. No.
You know, it seems like
since we got Esther back,
we got us back too.
I couldn't agree more.
How long do you
need to get dressed?
I can be quick.
Yeah?
I can be quick too.
I'm sorry.
No, they're cute.
Just close the door.
Just close the door.
What?
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, my God.
Do you know how much
I spent on this dress.
Let me look.
Oh, man.
I can fix that,
with a safety pin.
Right, or staples.
Staples will work.
You're responsible for
looking after your sister
while we're gone.
We're trusting you, okay.
Yeah, dad. I got it.
You look incredible.
We're off.
Probably won't be home
till after midnight, okay.
So, don't let her
stay up too late.
You have the keys?
Copy that.
You look nice.
Thanks.
Have a good night, honey.
Ciao.
Night.
So what are we going to do?
We?
Whoo!
Oh, it's out. Oh, shit,
guys, I'm sorry.
I was holding on
to it for too long.
Okay, is it, Gunnar, is
your sister different
than you remember?
I mean.. What do you think?
She's been at some
eastern European sex gulag.
Mike!
Yeah, no.
She, uh, she's
different, alright.
She's got an accent now.
And she dresses
like Lizzie Borden.
It's so fucking weird.
Who is Lizzie Borden?
Uh, some crazy chick who
killed her parents with an axe.
Uh, hey, Esther.
Why don't you go watch
a movie or something?
No.
Esther, this isn't your scene.
Go watch a movie.
Go fuck yourself.
Hey, Gunnar, you
know what I like.
Go.
Anyway, cheers.
Yeah, I'll fucking
drink to that.
What were we talking about?
Evening.
Hey, my parents aren't here.
They're at mom's gala.
Just my luck.
Having a party?
No, it's just a few friends.
You can smell the
weed from the street.
What?
Uh, I don't know, I don't know
what you're talking about.
Look, nothing's
going on here, okay?
So, um, why don't I just tell
my parents that you stopped by
and we can just
forget all about this?
Cool?
Cool.
Good.
Mind if I hit the
restroom before I go?
Yeah. Um, whatever, yeah, sure.
That was a blast.
No wonder those uptight
millionaires line up to give
the foundation money.
Oh, no. It's the booze.
It's not the booze, hon.
It's the host.
You bring the best
out of people.
Aww!
I just hope the house
is still standing.
I mean when I was
16, I-I nearly,
I nearly burned the house down.
No, Gunnar would never do that.
Who says I'm talking
about Gunnar?
Esther? We're home.
Esther?
The Saarne Institute?
Esther?
If you're not Esther,
who the hell are you?
How did you know
that I'm not Esther?
Her own mother
doesn't even know.
Yeah, kid, she does.
Damn it.
Mummy?
What the fuck are
you looking at?
So, let me get this straight.
You're a grown-ass woman
and a wanted criminal?
That is... beyond fucked up.
This is all I ever do
anymore by the way.
Clean up after my kids.
Don't worry about it.
Mommy will take care of it.
Mommy takes care of everything.
When Gunnar told me
Donnan came to the house,
I knew I'd find you here.
You could've robbed us blind
and disappeared the second you
had a chance, but you didn't.
Why is that?
You're thinking bigger.
Right?
Play the part, manipulate us..
And a year from now we meet
with some tragic accident.
Am I getting warm?
Let me go.
You'll never see me again.
That's exactly
what I'm afraid of.
We can't have Esther
disappear twice now, can we?
She didn't disappear.
There was nothing that
I could do for her.
It was too late.
Gunnar.. He was always
way too rough with her.
That night it just went too far.
What was I supposed to do?
Hand over the only child I had
left over some sibling bullshit
that went too far?
I loved my daughter,
with all my heart.
But a mother protects her
family, no matter what.
And if you think, that I'm
gonna let some psycho dwarf
destroy what I have
built.. You're mistaken.
This family came over on
the fucking Mayflower
and built this country.
We matter.
Allen matters.
When he got the news
Esther was alive..
The happiness on his face...
I had to make this work.
Allen doesn't know what
happened to Esther.
And you are gonna help me
make sure that he never does.
There's only one thing worse
than the death of a child.
And that is a
child who is missing.
Esther's disappearance
changed Allen.
Changed who he was.
Who he is supposed to be.
But you are the answer.
You and I have a chance
to turn this mess
into a mutually
beneficial arrangement.
Esther's down there, isn't she?
Don't you fucking say her name.
Okay. You conned your
way into my family.
You chose this role, and now
you're gonna fucking play it.
So you can be Esther for
now and live a life that anyone
would kill to have.
Or you take the fall for this
and get shipped back to Estonia
in handcuffs.
What do you say?
I'm sorry I scared you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We should've never
left you alone.
What happened?
She fell off her bike.
I found her by the
side of the road.
Honey, what were
you doing on a bike.
Come, let's-let's go on.
Mum, I'm so sorry.
Stop.
What the fuck!
Yeah.
So what does this mean?
Oh, it means.. She's not a kid.
She is a grown woman and we
cannot underestimate her.
No, she's more than that,
mother, she's a psychopath
living in our fucking house.
Shh.
So we just have to
live with this person?
I didn't say that.
So then can we just, you know,
make it look like an accident?
It's too soon.
We need to think about this.
So she just owns us now?
No, no.
She has much to lose as we do.
Look, neither of us
were expecting this.
So for now, we just
keep an eye on her
and when the time is right,
we'll end it.
This is insane.
Even for us.
Cut.
See that, it's set in fire.
Huh-uh.
Pull it back, just like that.
You get the bow, whip
it in and slide it.
- See this, are you watching?
- Yeah.
Yeah, and you.. Nice.
- You see that?
- Yeah, yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.
Our meeting with
Dr. Segar is today.
A problem we wouldn't have if
you hadn't talked to the parrot.
Sydney was a macaw.
A what?
All macaw's are parrots.
But not all fucking
parrots are macaws.
What are we gonna do about that?
Oh, we make her believe.
Together.
One of our goals here is
helping Esther acclimate back
into life within
the family unit.
Part of that is remembering
your shared history.
Moments you had, the fun
things you did together before.
Mr. Al bright, what's a memory
that means a lot to you
and to Esther?
Oh, God, there are so many.
Huh?
Um, there was
Christmas in Paris.
The summer in Tuscany.
Yellowstone?
Yeah, that's up there.
I was six.
We saw bears.. And a, a
chipmunk stole my sandwich.
Oh, my God, there were
so many chipmunks.
Mm-hmm, what else, Esther?
Be specific.
We stayed at Elk Ridge
Ranch and rode horses.
Mine was a pony named Nugget
and daddy's horse
was called Stretch.
And this one time when Stretch
leaned down to eat grass,
daddy fell right over his
head onto the ground.
He had dirt all over his face.
It was even in his teeth!
I can't believe you're
telling this story.
Oh, my God, it was in
your teeth for days.
In summary Esther exhibits
a healthy outlook on life.
Especially re-entering
into this family unit.
She's highly functioning.
Emotionally well.
That is all.
There are people
coming over today.
Just to see you.
They're friends of ours, who
knew Esther, so, enough with
the glowering, okay?
Esther is a lady.
Hmm.
I think I'm gonna
have to do some damage.
Okay.
I think we did good.
Everyone expects
Esther to be broken.
What they really want
is a happy ending.
We are gonna pretend that
pink is your favorite color.
Ooh, velvet.
The secret.
Let's give them a story
they want to believe.
This one is my favorite.
What's your favorite color?
Pink.
Very, very good.
Now, you say you can paint.
What else can you do?
I missed my family very much.
It's lovely to be back.
And what are your
plans now, young lady?
What are my plans, mummy?
Absolutely nothing.
I'm not letting you
out of my sight.
So let me get this straight.
You're 30?
Get out of my room, now, please.
It's not your room.
It's my dead sister's room.
You're not her and
you never will be.
Is that perfectly clear?
Fuck off.
Watch your mouth, freak.
You know, I'm glad everything's
out in the open now.
'Cause I'm done pretending
like you belong here.
You don't.
This is my house, my family.
And it will never be yours.
As long as you're
under this roof,
you and I will have an
understanding.
Here's what it is.
I fucking own you.
Do that again and I'll kill
you like I killed Esther.
One call from me, and you're
right back in that gulag.
You'd go down too.
Why, because of what the
illegal immigrant fugitive
mental patient said?
Good luck with that.
This is America.
People like me matter.
And if you're not Esther,
ah, it just means
Esther's missing again.
Mom has a problem with that.
I don't.
See you later, freak.
You are gonna sleep
like a fucking baby tonight.
I made roast lamb
with rosemary and tapenade.
And I know, Esther
doesn't like it.
So I made your favorite.
Oh, just like the old days.
I'm really excited about
going into the city tomorrow.
I'm gonna show the gallery
what I've been working on.
That sounds wonderful.
Well, it's all thanks to you.
Oh.
I rediscovered the joy I once
felt doing what I loved.
I feel like a kid again.
Do you wanna come?
I would love to!
Oh, Esther and I
already have plans.
Oh.
What plans?
It's a surprise.
Okay.
Well, another time then.
It's great that you're
painting again, dad.
Well, yeah.
May I be excused?
Oh, don't forget your.. You
can eat upstairs, it's okay.
Honey, hey, what's wrong?
Dad, she's fine.
Just give her some space.
She's fine.
Yeah.
She's probably tired from
all that piano playing.
Can I come in?
Mm-hmm.
Are you okay?
What happened down there?
I, uh, I don't really
like mummy's cooking.
Can you keep a secret.
I'm not crazy about it either.
Oh, listen, um, night time's
my favorite time to paint.
Do you, you wanna come join me?
Yes, I would love to.
I'll see you downstairs.
This is a such a great space.
I'm glad you like it.
Every artist needs a space to
let their inner weirdo out.
We get to see beauty, passion,
where others don't
even know to look.
I really like that.
So much paint.
Yeah, I'm a messy painter.
Drives your mother crazy.
I think I'm, I think
I'm done for the night.
Just turn the lights off.
Have a good night.
Looks like you two had fun.
He's right.
You are talented.
He is something, isn't he?
Are you so utterly
delusional to think that
he would want you?
"Surprise, I'm not your
daughter, I'm a mutant grifter."
He would be as repulsed
by you as I suspect
most men are.
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go upstairs
and fuck my husband.
He really is a new
man since you came back.
Thanks for that.
Hey, you.
Argh!
I think Esther's really
bummed about not coming to the
gallery with me.
Listen, I love that you and
Esther have painting in common.
I just, I don't have
anything like that with her.
I was hoping that I could
spend the day with her
and maybe we could find
something to share.
Plus it would be good for
you to be focused, right?
I mean if Sals likes what he
sees then, maybe you get a show
and you get back out there.
Yeah, okay.
We're not hurting, are we?
No, no.
Not at all.
I.. You are a great painter.
People miss seeing your work.
Thank you.
Is that bacon?
Oh, it's heaven!
Good morning, daddy.
Crepe?
Yes, please.
Is there anything you can't do?
Mummy?
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm gonna make my
usual... Smoothie?
Greek yogurt, kale, flax
seeds and lemon juice.
Just the way you like it.
Try it.
I'm-I'm not really that hungry.
I'll-I'll have it.
Here.
No, this is special,
just for mummy.
I made it for you.
Oh, sweetie, that's
so nice of you.
But I prefer to make my own.
Tricia, come on.
Try it.
Good.
Delicious
Thank you.
Tricia, you okay?
I'm good.
Yeah?
I know you
wanted to come with me.
But I think it'll be really
good for you to spend the day
with your mom.
I wanted to show you
something, though.
Here.
It's the one in the center.
Dean at Woodley
is a friend of mine.
Woodley is the best art
school in the country.
You're scary good, Esther.
Can I show it to them?
I would love it.
Thank you.
Can you bring this
up to the platform.
I'm just gonna get some coffee.
Just for mom and dad.
Mm-hmm.
Okay. I'll see
you up there.
Watch where you're going, kid!
Does she belong to you?
Yes, she does.
What happened?
Oh, nothing.
It's fine.
Esther tripped.
Sorry, it took forever.
No, no.
Knock 'em dead, okay?
Daddy, take me with you.
Oh, honey, I wish.
Next time.
Alright?
Alright, you're gonna
miss your train.
See you later, honey.
Ciao.
Easy, mom.
You think you can
fucking kill me?
Take this.
Tastes like fucking garbage.
Our arrangement is over.
You're fucking dead.
Hey!
Argh!
Mom!
Mom!
Oh, fuck!
Bitch!
Open the goddamn door.
Esther!
Sweetie, come on.
Don't you...
I'm sorry. Was I
driving too fast?
You must be Esther.
I need to go to the hospital.
You're fine.
It feels like I'm being stabbed
a thousand fucking times.
Officer Leahy!
Oh, my God!
Can you just be quiet
for like two seconds.
What?
We've located, Esther.
You did!
I'm bringing her home.
Oh.
Oh, and I've informed
Allen as well.
Okay, bye.
Fuck!
You're okay.
You're okay.
Thank you so much.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh.
Thank you so much.
Esther's behavior has been so
erratic since she got back.
To be honest, it's
been really hard.
I mean there's constant lying
and these outbursts of
anger and...
Sometimes she even jokes
about hurting herself
and I don't think she's
really joking.
You have her in therapy?
Yes, yes.
Look who's back.
Get up.
We're doing this... now.
Well, it's about goddamn time.
Fuck.
I am done with you.
Nothing is worth having
you in this house.
Your suicide is gonna
break daddy's heart.
But he'll get over it.
Uck!
Ah! Aaagh!
Just die, you freak!
Where is she?
I, uh, I, uh, I didn't mean to.
Oh, that's just brilliant.
It just happened.
Tricia.
Hi, honey.
The police just called me.
Oh, I know.
I'm, I'm sorry.
It was my fault.
Esther wandered off at the
store and I-I just, I panicked.
But I called Officer Leahy
and, and they found her.
- Oh, good.
- Mom.
What?
Well, I'm-I'm on the train..
Hold on.
I'm-I'm coming back home.
I'll be...
Go downstairs and finish it.
What?
Go downstairs and finish it.
Tricia, are you still there?
Tricia, is everything okay?
Tricia, I-I'm coming home now.
What?
I'm coming home.
Uh, what about your
meeting with Sal?
Forget about that.
No, sweetie, I swear
everything is fine.
Esther is here.
All is well.
But I'm almost at
the station now.
Okay.
Well, can you please
take a cab home?
Because I really have
my hands full here.
Yeah.
No.
Fuck it.
There you are.
Esther.
Come on out, Esther.
Or whatever the
fuck your name is.
You know.. It doesn't
have to be like this.
Really, Gunnar?
I'm sure we could
figure something out.
You really believe that?
Honestly, no.
Me neither.
Shit.
Gunnar?
No.
No.
What, what have you done?
What have you done?
You've taken everything.
Allen will never be yours.
But I can promise you this,
he'll know who you are.
The deformed freak who
manipulated our grief,
murdered my son and
tried to kill me.
Until I did what had to be done.
Call the fire department.
Gunnar!
Gunnar!
Aaagh!
Do it!
Hold on, I'm coming.
Daddy, mommy tried to hurt me!
Allen!
Please help!
Allen!
Don't let go.
I can't hold on much longer.
I'm losing my grip.
- Da-daddy, help!
- Hang on.
I'm coming.
She's not Esther!
She's a grown woman!
- She's lying!
- What?
- She tricked us!
- Mommy is lying!
- Give me your hand.
- No, daddy, please help me.
Tricia!
What the fuck?
I did this for you.
For us.
So we could be together.
Allen, I love you.
Who the fuck are you?
You're a monster!
Allen!
The fire took
everything from Esther.
Her home, her family.
The whole situation
is so tragic.
It's horrifying.
I know.
As if Esther hasn't been
through enough already.
Abducted, and now an orphan.
With no family to take her in?
What will happen now?
I've reached out to
a reputable adoption agency.
I'm confident we'll find a
home where Esther can get the
support and love she deserves.
After all who wouldn't
want to adopt her?
