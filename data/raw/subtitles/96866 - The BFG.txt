.
Then you become afraid, you know.
That's the most horrible thing I ever heard

You poor little wurmsel.
Do not cry...

I do not let the side.
You make me so sad.
Do not worry. I'm there now
surely not?
No, but you are here.
The other giants do you swallow,
as they show a glimpse of your picks.
And it's my fault because I
geknipknapt you have.
Why did you do that?
Because if I had not weggewurmd...
... you go rondjodelen
that you saw a giant everywhere.
And then people catch me
and stops me at the zoo.
That is true.
So you should just stay here with me
.
O, forever?
Who will take care of me?

So tasty as chicken.
Oh, oh, yeah?

You really think so?
Zo.
This nightgown must be washed.
This is delicious.
GV... BFG?
What did you do last night in the village?
- It's private and personal secretly.
But what did you do with that trumpet?
I saw you blew it.
You are more curious than one aagje.
- I will not really ask for more.
Well, if you must know it.
I have a dream in that room geblaast.
Blow you dream?
- Yes, that's my job.
If all those other giants weggaloppeert
hunting for human fabrications...
... I will dream about
with my old suitcase.
Beautiful dreams for children.
You can not dream in one case have
. They're in your head.
I knew you would not understand.
I tell nothing.
Oh, come on.
I say nothing, not a word more
against you, for you are dressed.
Have you made for me?
It's not very special.
Beware t but even if you want.
I've never had a new dress.
And I wanted so badly.
And a place to live, as here.
You are sure to show a blind eye?
- I am not tired.
Can I have one sip of water?
- D'r is not a sip of water here.
Only fropskottel.
Certainly grease truly disgusting and helpful,
like snoskommer.
Oh, no. That does you wrong.
Fropskottel is sweet and zwijmelig.
It heats all the muscles of your heart.
- Yeah, I suppose.
This is well fropskottel.
Have you ever seen so blessed bruiselijk
stuff?
Oh look, it 's buzzing in the wrong direction.
The bubbles go down, not up.
Of course, bubbles will not rise.
- Where I come from it.
Bells going up
's a raunchy dangerousness.
Why?
If bubbles bubbling up, come
they look like a prisperige farmer.
Yes, but there is still nothing against?
Nothing against? That's verrezelijk.
Giants will never do that.
- But if bubbles go down, then...
... they escape somewhere else.
- Yes, you have all the right bar.
And that makes one much worse sound.
- A flash popper.
What?
- A flash popper.
It's a sign of happiness.
It is music to millions.
Not true. It's indecent.
Your man still makes baked goods also
flash poppers. Yeah, right?
Yes, but...
- Of course. Everybody's doing it.
A sip of this prickly spullie
and you see the universe
is jummie, diedeldedummie
and you shoot off with a bang
three times three is seventy
and fropskottel gives three kilos interested
it is remarkable, peculiar
that people do not flash dolls where they are
ahead, but trial.
It's... It's fantastic.
This is just the beginning.
Here comes one flash popper.
- You still do not indecent?
Flitspop, flash bang, go

Flash bang, flitspop,

It starts with a sip of 't stuff
which pricks your tongue
you feel it go,
it is not to resist

= = I feel the bubbles in my stomach
itch.
I'm going to believe me...

What is that noise?
Oh no.
BFG, go back.
I'm afraid.
- No, we have important work to do.
Hey, come here.
Where are you going?
It is not yet dark.
No, Vleeslapeter.
I walk around a bit.
I Zalt let you go this time.
He was in a bad mood chief.
Bad mood? I thought he would murder you
.
No, no. Giants kills
no other giants.
She is not like a human fabrications.
- What do you mean?
Well, people baked goods bomt and shoot

She is the only animal that makes
death together.
A cat with mice died.
- But no other cats. Do you?
Dreamland Set in this mountain?
- Wait 's off.
I will show you something
extraordinary thing.
What is that?
That's droomweg.
It is the stairway to Dreamland.
I have him never show it to anyone
.
Oh, dear. What we...
This is one very woolly trip.
Well you are in Dreamland.
Am I 's first son
coming here?
Oh, yes. Even the other giants
never comes here.
Really?
- It flies here plates at dreams.
Where?
- There. Listen.
I hear...
Missed.
- What missed?
Well, just missed.
Ha, yeah, right there.
Quickly, quickly. Open that bottle.
Zo.
I know that there is nothing in it.
- It's a gnifgnuiver.
No, even better: A sjuweeltje.
A gold ceremonial gem.
Certainly very rare, huh?
- Yes, it's the rarest thing there is.
Later they fly in swarms
around today.
Hups, there I go.
D'r is something there.
- Of course.
Quickly, I got another one.
Can I look up later?
- So you believe it now?
Oh, yeah.
- Come with me.
I can not. How do you do that?
- It never works unless you try it.
I can fly.
- See?
Secretly in your dream
looking up now and then
a place far from home
where no one can get
Alone on a cloud
where nothing is around you
than moon and stars and sun
and you float there so badly and you tumble down
beware soon touch the ground
secretly in your dream
can you find and then
a place far from home
where nobody can come
you never want to leave there
Look, there's one behind you. Get him.
Secretly, far from home
where nobody can come
Look out, look out. Gotcha.
- What is it? What did you catch?
A troll beater.
- An animal?
No, a dream. The duivelste
dream of all.
Why do we keep it?
- I'm going to him trapped inside.
This gives kids nightmares.
- Let's go quickly.
Where are we going?
The little children do not
side without their dreams?
We will pack our suitcase.
Here?
- No.
Here, in my dream cave.
BFG, it's just heaven.
These are dreams.
All dreams.
Sometimes I come down here, only
but to look at them.
I want to always look
. It's magic.
Dreams are mysterious things,
but it is not magic.
Dreams really like this troll beater.
That will put me at all
my other griezelgrubels.
So, which side do not make little children
afraid.
What are you doing?
Oh, I wrote labels.
For if I keep the bottles apart.
Do you know where the dream becomes
if you listen to it?
I only hear some kind gekinkel.
- You have very good ears.
That dream music.
It is a kind of language.
What does it mean?
This is a dream about a boy
being invisible.
Nice, can we take him?
- I first makes a pass corpse slot.
What do you mean?
Your man fabrications
really do not know much, do you?
Dreaming is no tales.
Dreams is more like...
... like pictures in a book.
And I still want to make a story, then all I
mixes dreams together.
Here I have an end.
I hates algebra...
... so I haunted Mr. Grom...
... math teacher so running away.
Nice. Very suitable for a boy.
- Say that again. It is a gnifgnuiver.
We will'm soon to give someone.
You start with him?
How do you know what he likes?
- If I were to peek inside...
... I get one itch inside
and I know it.
If he pressed his navel,
he becomes invisible.
Go on, put it on.
- Let's see how the teacher is afraid.
What happens?
Oh, no. A ghost. Stay away from me.
Come, we can not stay here. We
blows even trillions dreams tonight.
Comes, Sofie.
- Give those with the clowns and the circus.
I've never had so much fun.
It's like I'm...
Oh, stop him.
No.
You just took off.
You could have stopped him.
I side not stop him.
He would strike me down and crush tars.
- You're a coward.
Yes, but I also goest run away
to save you.
I do not want. All children must be rescued
and not disappear.
There will be many, many more
disappear tonight.
What do you mean?
- I did hear them talking.
She knows' n
boarding school completely full of little girls.
Oh, no.
- Yes, and also full of little boys.
Tonight she goes there.
- Where are the schools?
Where did I come from you: In England.
BFG, we must stop them.
- We can do anything about it.
Fixed though. We ask if someone helps us
.
Who would help us?
We tell t the people of England.
They throw them in jail.
Yes, and me in the zoo.
And you back in the orphanage.
Man Bakes is not as friendly

Well, the Queen of England.
It is certainly not glibberslijmer.
Well...
No glibberslijmer and no premiums miss
and no mercury rotter.
Yes, we do.
We go to the queen.
She believes you from his haze days.
- Then let 't believe her.
How?
- I do not know.
But you said it yourself in Dreamland.
You can never do anything if you do not try it.
Dreamland. BFG, wait. Listen.
Can you give someone a
dream about something, anything...
... what in the world?
- Yes of course.
If that just sits in my collection.
- Well, you've been dreaming about me?
And you? And giants that eat
children?
A little bit of this and briefly stir
what... Yeah...
And a smattering of these.
And a big dollop of this. Yes...
Yes, it will succeed.
So, he's ready.
Yes, it has become as
like you invented.
I hope very much that this plan will work
.
I hope so too.
We got lost.
- No, you know. We are almost there.
I heard quacking ducks down there.
We are out in the country.
No, that's probably a St. James' Park.
Countries only.
There's Buckingham Palace.
Forward.
Where sleeps the queen, Sofie?
- I do not know.
We need to find.
No. No.
That's only two dogs.
This is a lady. Beginning a look.
Yes, she is.
Well just wait and see.

Mary, what's wrong with you?
- It's your dream, ma'am.
It's in the newspaper.
Good heavens.

Oh, how did you get there?
It's really unbelievable.
It gets crazier in this palace.
Come on, dr swings is for you.
Mary  No, wait a minute.
Be honest...

on the windowsill?
Yes, ma'am. Certainly, madam.
As sure as I'm standing here.
Right, it's like this:
I dreamed that there's a girl would be.
Well, well, it's true.
Yes, right? Just look.
Dear child, come here.
You do really exist, right?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
And your name is Sophie?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
The girl from my dream.
How did you get here?
- Last night she really was not here.
You've certainly dreamed about me.
- Yes.
Yes, that's right.
I dreamed a giant you put down
and he is now waiting in the garden.
Yes, it is.
- O heaven, save me.
Do not worry.
It is my friend. He is very sweet.
I want to believe. But why are
you and your friend here?
Did you not also dream that?
- Yes.
Now that you mention it, yes. That's true.
You came to help us catch those
samples.
That child murderers.
- I do not feel so good.
You've dreamed so.
- But how do you know what I dreamed?
The BFG can explain
if I may call him.
BFG?
- That means Big Friendly Giant.
He's... -... in the garden. I know.
Right, Sofie. Call him.
BFG, come on out.
A giant in the garden. I've never heard anything so ridiculous
.
There he is.
This is the BFG.

We are very glad to see you.
O monarch, O Majestin, gold
O Sovereign, O Sultana.
I came here with my girlfriend Sofie
and save you from...
... big cramp.
- He means disaster.
He sometimes talks a little weird.
- I think your language excellent.
O Majestin. Ah, diederdom.
I was completely stale.
I have many secret washers
for Uwe Majestin.
That I would particularly like to hear.
Do you want to have breakfast with us?
- With proper lubrication snoskommers, Majestin?
Excuse me, what did you say?
- Of course not.
You get something very tasty.
Eggs with bacon.
Mary, rule by Mr. Tipps
breakfast. Mary?
Well, today.
It is in every bite better,
this egg with bacon king.
Thank you, sir.
That will hear the cook happy.
Tipps, while Mr. breakfast
summons you to the head of the army...
... and the Air Force.
It's an emergency.
As you wish.
Do not fropskottel
to flash dolls?
No.
Well, dr will also flash dolls themselves.
If I want it so.
If you just leave.
- What? Not flash dolls?
None cheerful music?
- Let him sing as he wants.
He does not sing.
- I love music at breakfast.
In Scotland they play bagpipes
under my window.
Flash Dolls is more beautiful than bagpipes,
Majestin.
That will probably. Come, play 't agree.
No, do not do it, though.
I side are difficult onbehoorzaam
a real queen.
I think I'd rather hear
a bagpipe.
It is fixed on those children?
- What kids?
They're gone tonight.
- Oh, that. Nonsense.
You know how kids are.
Inventing everything.
There are bones found and giant tracks.
- Bones? Nonsense.
Giant Spurs. Piffle.
All inventions.
Course. Children hinder his.
Damned if it is not true.
Good morning, Your Majesty.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you so quickly.
- Tipps was talking about an emergency.
Yes, you know the missing children?
Oh, yeah. Absolute nonsense of course...
What? O...
Oh, absolutely a disaster, Your Majesty.
Terrible.
There must be a simple explanation.
- Right. They are eaten by giants.
I do not feel much for that conclusion.
- Oh no?
Well, giants, Your Majesty.
We know that not eh...
Well?
- Eh exist.
No, anyway. Not anymore.
- Yeah look, Your Majesty...
Take, for that matter from those tracks.
According to information which were two meters long.
Yes.
- Say "were not really footsteps...
... Then the author would be about...
Let's see, how high?
So high?
Yes, at least...
What?
- We protect you, Your Majesty.
Nothing to worry about though, kid.
Do not worry.
Gentlemen, I present to you: Sofie.
- How do you do?
And this is our friend: Mr. BFG.
- Good morning, Sir.
O gutskukels pots and thickeners.
What is that?
That was Louis XV.
Well, ma'am. But on the sheet.
Listen carefully to what he has to say
.
Fiddlesticks. What a horrible story.
How many of these villains are there?
Well, the Mensenmepper, Vleeshakker,
Kinderkauwer, Butcher Boy...
... and...

Yes, the Blood bottler, Girl Stamper,
Vleeslapeter, the Bones Kraker...
... the Schrokschranzer...
That's...
Nine.
- Yes, nine.
Grace that there are a lot.
- The strategy is obvious.
Tanks.
- Tanks? Nonsense.
Bombs.
- Bombs? Ridiculous.
Tanks and heavy artillery.
- Artillery? Madness.
Strakjes you would like cavalry too.
- Tanks, artillery and cavalry.
Nothing more.
- This requires modern technology.
Low-flying bombers,
powerful explosives...
... guided missiles and we shoot
them to shreds.
It is an old enemy, so
is an old tactic necessary.
They weaken with one bombardment, further
with tanks and then it machinegun.
We mow them down.
Tanks.
Lord.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
There are no bombs and guns.
- Excuse me, ma'am?
The Giants are not harmed.
- What?
They eat children. They are murderers.
- We do not follow their example.
Exactly Truly.
Five times five is not always six.
- They are twice as big as he is.
Without guns we never get them.
- And no bombs.
I know what.
- Without guns go our men dead.
What?
- I know how to catch them.
Of course 't be. Yeah, right?
- Yes, of course it can.
How?
Well, the giants have been busy all night
and now sleep soundly.
Blimey, that's a long guy.
All right. Sit down.
All right, men. To work.
We need not be afraid.
Okay, boy.
It's okay. I got you.
Success.
- Yes.
Not all human fabrications is
glibberslijmers. This is brave.
Come along, come along.
We are going to surprise Hare Majestin.
Good work, guys.
Karwei done, some wounded,
nothing serious.
Good work.
Let the helicopters coming.
One does not need. It was eight.
What weird.
- He said there were nine.
You've heard how he speaks.
He firmly counts.
Look out, look out.
BFG?
BFG?
I come and get you.
Quick, hide.
BFG, come back.
- I was now the only one who can stop him.
I want to be a coward.
You're not a coward. Sorry.
Come back.
You, you showed them the way.
Exactly Indeed, I showed them the way.
Why? What?
You are a bad guy.
I'm very best.
You are not a giant.
You just like humans baking.
A man baking. Yes, I would rather be a man
baking a giant like you.
Then I will kill you.
No, stay away from him.
What?
Come here.
Human Baking.
BFG.
No, do not go away.
No, Sjaak. No beanstalk.
Sofie?
Sofie.
My little Sophie.
BFG, you saved me.
I did not save you, you
saved me.
Did you give him the troll beater?
Yes, I was still glad we had
gevangt.
What was the dream about?
- About Sjaak.
Sjaak?
- Yes.
Giants are only afraid Sjaak.
He is a famous giant-slayer.
Does he sometimes a beanstalk?
- Yeah, do you know him?
I Zalt Sjaak not like to encounter.
- It is not necessary.
Why you laugh as well, Sofie?
I'll tell you sometime.
The men that the giants have captured and imprisoned...
...
receive the royal honor for extraordinary bravery.
Sofie who can not go to the orphanage
because we closed the...
... will have its own place in our
in the palace.
She and her little buddy from the home
may live here as long as they want.
What we do with Ms. Clonkers,
is still unknown.
Ms. Clonkers can give the Giants
food.
We do not want that they are
people eat more?
No people majestin.
Dirty snoskommers.
And something else will no longer
to eat.
Then Mrs. Clonkers may be their keeper.
Finally, our friend will have the BFG...
... the greatest and most beautiful palace
we have.
There he may live the rest of his life
.
O noble Majestin...
... I thank you from the bottom of my...
... my...
- Heart.
My heart.
It's a very large gentleman
you make me.
But I have ervandoort.
- You are not going away?
Going?
I still have work to do, see,
Majestin.
There is another blow to dreams.
I must continue.
I understand 't completely. Everyone
simply his responsibilities.
Exactly Truly.
Goodbye, Majestin.
