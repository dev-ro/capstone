- [man] No.

- [man] No.
- [woman] Are you ready?
- [man] Yes.
[woman] Okay, the Swiss astronomer
who discovered dark matter was...
- [man] Ferrero Rocher?

No...
No.
[laughs] This is impossible. Uh...
You said that this was gonna be
the easiest class, and it's not.
The only reason you took this class
is because that really hot girl
was gonna take it.
You know what? Forget finals.
I am a drummer in a band,
and you are a brilliant artist.
Look at this.
You've got a great future
ahead of you, Nat.
Not yet, which is why
I need to graduate with honors...
- Mm-hmm.
- ...so I can get my job in LA...
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and impress the shit out of my bosses
so I can make my own movies,
that's what I want.
You're gonna do it.
- Yeah.
- 'Cause of the five-year plan.
- If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.
- Plan to fail.
- Exactly correct.
- Live, love, laugh.
- "Live, laugh, love." We've talked about...
- Live, laugh, love.
Gabe, this is important.
What we're doing right now
is setting us up for our future.
Okay, fine.
But you got the future covered,
so I got the present. Let's go.
- A toast.
- A toast? To what?
Drink first, then I'll tell you.
My band
finally got sponsored for our tour.
Your band got sponsored for your...
- [screams] Oh my God! Shit. Sorry.
- [woman] Shh!
- Yeah.
- [squeals]
See? That's why I'm saying, like,
Nat, we're graduating.
And you're gonna pass, and I'm gonna pass,
and you don't realize that your...
your five-year plan is already in motion.
Mm-hmm.
But we only have this moment once.
The present moment.
- The present moment?
- Mm-hmm.
So what do you suggest we do
to harness this present moment?
[laughs] This is crazy.
It's batshit.
[laughing]
We're just friends.
- Good friends.
- Yeah.
Very good friends.
[Nat] And we're so different.
[Gabe] I mean,
we couldn't be more opposite.
I mean, we're not even
attracted to each other, really.
Oh,
that's not true.
Gabe?
Nat?
- Just promise me...
- What?
Promise me this doesn't
have to be a big deal.
What could possibly change?

Yeah. Take your time.

We shouldn't be in this situation.

Hmm.
Oh God.

This should be your choice.

I'm pro-your-choice.

I think I'm gonna have this baby.
Okay.
So you and Gabe...
He was really...

understanding.

- We're obviously not gonna be a couple,
but he wants to help,
and I could really use that right now.
Just for a while.
I don't know how to explain it.
It's just, it feels like
this is something...

Yes, you can.
If anyone can do it, it's you.
- Nat.
- You worked
so hard for this.
And you have
that advertising job lined up. Remember?
So you're gonna go.
And don't worry about me.
I can still draw, one way or another.
I'll figure it out.
Okay?
Okay.

I'll find the right time to tell them.

Hi! Honey, what are you doing here?
- I thought you were on your way to LA.
- Hey!
Hi, Gabe!
- It's great to see ya.
- I'm pregnant.
What?
Him?
[clearing throat]
Can we... talk about it?
I didn't... I didn't even know
that you guys were a thing.
We're not.
Oh, great!
Yeah, no, we're just friends, mostly.
- Uh-huh.
- Um...
Every day, except one day. Uh...
It was a night, really.
Just... It was half a night.
- [mother] Good Lord!
- Stop. Gabe!
Wow!
[Nat] I'm still trying to figure this out.
I'm trying to make
the best decision here.
- Right.
- Moving forward.
I... I know you guys are very happy
- with your empty nest that you've had...
- It's been great.
...and you've been enjoying that.
But could I possibly
come home?
[Gabe] Hmm.
What about your goals?
What about moving to LA?
- What about...
- You just got your degree, Nattie.
That's everything you'd worked towards
since you were a little girl.
- Everything you dreamed about.
- I'm still gonna work in animation, Dad.
- Some... Someh... Ye... I am!
- I mean... [sighs]
It's just being put on pause
for a... a minute.
Wha...
What... what did you study again, Gabe?
- History.
- History? [laughs]
Oh!
Yeah, I'm still obviously trying
to figure out what to do with that.
[whispers] Stop. Gabe.
But, um, I'm planning to work as a... uh...
Keep my job in dry cleaning, and, um...
throughout the summer, between gigs.
- Gigs?
- I'm also a... a drummer in a band.
Drummers...
So, a musician.
Does that pay?
Uh...
Not yet.
Then you're not a musician.
You're a dry cleaner.
And now you got us on spin cycle,
don't you, pal?
No, you can't do that. You can't tell him
to give up on his dream.
- You've gotta give up yours. Why can't...
- I'm not...
- I'm not giving up my dream!
- With all due respect, Ms. Bennett...
- [Nat] No, I'm not!
- ...I'm gonna be doing my share.
Your share?
I think you've already done your share!
- You can't have this judgmental attitude.
- Your share has been accomplished!
- We're trying to come to you...
- You think we're gonna be like...
- What conversation did you think...
- Hold on. Tina, just...
Guys, just hold on. We've all got
a lot of feelings right now, okay?
Your mother and I, in particular,
towards this... young gentleman...
- And you.
- I know.
I think the best thing
that can be done at this moment
is for you and I
to take a few deep breaths.
We're gonna take a moment.
- Step outside onto the porch.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, I'm serious. Come on.
- Okay.
- Wow.
- I think it's the best thing to do.
[father sighs]
[door slides open]
[groans]
Did we not teach her about safe sex?
- Not show her how to put on a condom?
- We did.
We did. We taught her about condoms.
I remember the conversation.
She was 15. I was sweating.
They were just not expecting it
to play out that way.
They weren't ex...
- I wasn't expecting... this.
- [Tina] ...to do?
- I did not see...
- [Tina] Why are you okay with this?
- ..."single, unemployed, 22-year-old mom"...
- [Tina] Why are you not freaking out?
...on my tarot card reading
that Cara gave me last month.
What about our plans?
What about naked Sundays?
- And furniture with sharp edges?
- [groans]
- We were going to Barcelona next year.
- Hey...
[Gabe] I've been thinking
about that quite a bit.
It would make sense if...
- What?
- If you and I just...
[father] I need a therapist right now,
but naked Sundays...
- If, um...
- They're not gonna be on...
Oh, no. Uh-uh.
- Let's get married.
- [Tina] Nope!
- Nuh-uh! No! Get up! That's not happening!
- [Nat]! Hey!
- Hey! Hey!
- [Tina] Get up!
- He's not talking to you!
- You better be praying. Get up. Sit.
- I've thought a lot since last night...
- Oh, a well-thought-out decision.
They've been thinking about this all...
Since last night.
- Sorry. I thought it was a rash decision.
- We'll go back out.
I thought this was a quick thing.
Like, "We're having a ba..."
- No, they thought for four to six hours.
- It's okay. Use your head!
I don't know why
you're being so weird about this, Rick.
- They clearly have this under control.
- [door closes]
[mouths]
What? Uh...
- It's not as thought out as it could be.
- Gabe.
- We're still figuring things out.
- Gabe.
- You know? Yeah...
- I know.
You're gonna be such a good dad.
And if I'm gonna be in this situation
with anyone, I'm glad that it's with you.
Really.
You know?
But you wanna marry someone
that you're in love with. I know you do.

You have to know people in this town,

Maybe just don't be late for work.
Mm. Good idea.
Yeah.
Hey, Nat. Did you know that
everyone in LA has a job title,
like they're on The Bachelor?
No.
Yeah, well, I met this girl last night
who said she was
a supervisor for gifted youth.
Um, I don't know what that means.
Yeah, I didn't either.
Apparently, she's just the nanny
for some celebrity's kids.
Oh, LA is so weird.
Anyway, how are you?
Um...
I'm kinda terrible, actually.
Um...
Yesterday, I just basically ate crackers

and then threw up for the rest of the day.

Are you free this afternoon or tomorrow

Yeah.
Great. Uh...
[elevator bell dings]
- [sighs]
- [Jake] Natalie. Hi.
Hi...
I found your résumé, and I had Hannah
put it at the top of the pile.
- Jake.
- Um... uh, yeah.
Yeah, you remember. That's so sweet.
You work here.
Yeah. The fact that you studied both
2D and 3D animation is your selling point.
You gotta lead with that.
Do you know how to roll calls?
Don't answer that.
When she asks you, the answer is "yes."
Why did you not tell me
that you worked here?
Ah, it didn't come up. I don't know.
I thought you might be nuts.
You thought I might be nuts? You knew,
hey, that Lucy wasn't even in there.
Of course I knew
Lucy wasn't in there.
You can't just accost a major player
at an event.
It's like... like a valet handing Spielberg
his screenplay along with his car keys.
Accosting her...
Well... I didn't know
what you were gonna do.
Look, the point is,
there aren't many people in this town
who would rather print out résumés
on a Friday night than hang at a party.
- Hmm.
- That's why you're here.
Nice blazer. Don't wear it.
You're not a real estate agent.

Yes. Weird.

Hmm.

Can I borrow your face?
Mm... What? My face?
Okay. Uh... Why don't we try happy?
Gleeful! [chuckles]
Why don't you try anger?
- Anger?
- Yeah.
What about confused?
- I'm so sorry. Who are you?
- Natalie Bennett.
- Natalie Bennett.
- Yes.
Natalie Bennett
with a paper folded résumé.
Okay, so you studied 3D? [chuckles]
- And 2D.
- Mm.
I'm actually more of an illustrator.
So what was that,
some sort of hybrid situation?
- No, I doubled.
- Oh.
After doing my research,
I figured that I'd have a better shot
at getting a job if I knew how to do both.
And, um... it's not like 3D
is devoid of illustration these days.
You have Spider-Verse, Paperman...
New draft is in.
They wanna discuss it for...
- Sorry.

Oh, I was just... I was just gonna say
I loved your homage to Fiver

It was... beautiful.
Thanks.
And you got Tucker
to do the background work on that, yeah?
Uh... Mm-hmm.
Amazing.
Who's this?

Oh.
Uh, can you roll calls?
Yes.

[fluttering]
- Ugh! Cara! Roach! Roach!
- [chittering]
[fireworks exploding]
- [Rick] Happy New Year!
- [Tina] Happy New Year!
[both] Happy New Year!
[Rick] It's gonna be a great one!
Happy New Year!
First year's torture for everybody.
It's long days, late nights.
Very little sleep.
Did you have a social life
that you liked before this?
- Not really.
- Very good.
That would never have survived.
It's like having a child, basically. Um...
Keep your head down, eyes on the prize.
Soon, you'll have your own assistant.
Have you always wanted
to work in animation?
Honestly, no. Nothing against animation.
But, um... I think
it's more of a stepping-stone for me.
- Uh-huh.
- Um, I moved around a lot as a kid.
Met a lot of interesting people.
A lot of weird places.
[Nat] Mm.
Eventually, what I wanna do
is kinda tell those stories.
I don't know whether
it's narrative or documentary, but, um...
that's what I wanna... what I wanna do,
is tell those stories.
What about you?
Um... I stayed in the same place growing up.
That's why I moved to LA,
so I could have those experiences.
That's why I'm at this job.
You're in the perfect position.
For me, I think it's a slightly smaller
part of the five-year plan.
The five-year plan?
What's the quote? "If you fail to plan,
you should plan to fail."
[laughing] Oh!
- What?
- [laughs]
I can't believe you just said that.
I didn't. Benjamin Franklin said it.
But I used to say that all the time,
and I would get so much shit for it.
For quoting Benjamin Franklin
or for having a five-year plan?
- For both.
- I don't understand that.
- Why would anybody give you shit...
- I don't know!
What is it?
What do people have against planning?
What do people have against planning?
I think it's great that
you have a five-year plan.
- Me too.
- Cheers to five-year plans.
To five-year plans.
- What? I hate these books!
- [both laughing]
These books suck.
Everyone says something different.
How do you know?
How do you know which one to follow?
- Uh...
- Eeeh! Oooh...
- What's up?
- [Nat] She's kicking a lot.
- Yeah?
- [Nat] Yeah.
Oh, wow!
I think I'm having contractions.
- What? Right now? That's... Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- I'm scared we're gonna screw this up.
- Okay.
- We're gonna screw it up.
- Of course. That's unavoidable, but...
- Oh shit.
- [groans]
Your parents screwed you up, right?
- My parents screwed me up.
- Yeah!
Their parents screwed them up.
That's the cycle
of people screwing each other up.
[Nat laughs]
- [Gabe] Okay.
- [Nat] Ooh...
Oh, oh, oh!
We should stop at, um...
a Whataburger on the way.
- For what?
- Because I need to eat.
- They're not gonna let me eat there.
- That's probably for a reason.
No! I'm about to push a baby
out of my vag,
and I'm gonna do it
after eating a buffalo chicken sandwich.
- Let's go!
- Okay. All right. Aah!
Aah...
Oh my God! My parents!
[Gabe] I'm gonna call them. Don't worry.
[siren bleeps]
Um... This way.
- This way? Okay.
- Yeah.
- Did they stop at Whataburger?
- [laughs]
- Huh?
- That's my girl!
Yeah, she's havin' major contractions,
but you're doin' a great job.
We're makin' it happen.
This is how you do it.
- You don't panic.
- [Tina] Here we go.
[Rick] You make things happen.
Guys? Come on. Hey, guys.
- [Tina] Rick!
- Yeah?
Hey, you gotta
keep me posted on this stuff.
- [groaning]
- Here... Oh, here it comes.
Okay, it's gonna... Here it comes.
Breathe it through. Try to breathe.
Do you want me to get you
a juice box or a water?
- [moans]
- Okay.
Oh, hey, quick question.
Or forget it. Very busy. Sorry.
I just realized I gotta relearn
all those lullabies I used to sing you.
- I remember that.
- Yeah.
- [laughs]
- You're doin' great.
[midwife] Nine,
- eight...
- [groaning]
[midwife] ...seven...
All right.
You're not goin' down, are you, Dad?
[Gabe] No, I'm good. I'm good.
- [midwife] Okay. Five...
- I'm good. You got it. There you go.
...four...
There we go. Good.
[baby cries]
- Oh! All done!
- [gasping] I... Oh!
[baby crying]
[midwife] Good job, Mom!
Here you go, Mom.
Hi, baby.
- [crying]
- Hi, baby!
Hi, baby!
Hi, Rosie.
[whistling]
- Hey!
- Hi.
Um, do you have
any kids experience, by chance?
[snorts] No!
Okay. Doesn't matter. Come with me.
- What did you do?
- Oh my God!
Uh, well, it's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
And I wanted to pet one for my birthday.
[Nat] Okay.
The other ones got jealous,
so I had to pet them too.
You let them all out of the crate?
- Yes, I did. That's what happened.
- Yeah.
- I think it...
- They're eating the storyboards.
- Oh my God, they are. Wow. Okay. Um...
- [paper tearing]
All right, you get the storyboards.
I will handle... [claps]
I happen to be great with kids.
- [bleating]
- [Jake] You go first.
I leave you alone for five minutes.
- You get up on the table.
- Excuse me. Aah... Pardon me.
Hi, buddy. Oh, sorry.
Not what I had in mind.
[Nat] No, no, no. No, no, no.
- This thing does not want to stop. Aah!
- [Jake] They've run amok.
- They're eating the things.
- Come on, guys. Just chase 'em away.
- Excuse me. Go! Hey, hey, hey.
- You're doing great. You're a natural.
Put your face on his face.
[whispering] I dare you.
Put your face on his face. It's so soft.
Aw!
[Rosie screaming]
[gasps] Oh! Shh!
- [Rosie crying]
- [Nat] Sh, sh, sh!
- Oh, baby.
- Hey.
Oh no!
- It's up her back.
- Take her to the tub, please.
[Rosie screaming]
- [water running]
- [Gabe] Sh, sh, sh.
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Whoa! [groans]
Gabe, you're gonna wanna point
the explosive end away from you, okay?
Can you give me a hand?
I can't reach the...
If you can believe it,
these are the moments
you're gonna miss the most.
Good night. [groans]
[laughing]
Goats?
- There were a lot of them.
- Why?
Because it was Jake's birthday.
He wanted to let them out and pet them.
It was really cute.
Can I come work with you, meet Jake?
It sounds like you guys have fun.
- [window opens]
- I hate my job.
[woman] Shh!
Wha...
Hello?
You are so loud!
[scoffs]
You are so loud!
- [laughs]
- Also, this is not a library!
Well...
- Here! Pretend!
- What...
Oh my God!
Hey! I'm keeping this book.
- [crickets chirping]
- [Rosie crying]
[Gabe murmuring]
You!
No, no.
I'm not going to sleep
because I'm your night owl.
- [cooing]
- What else? You nocturnal?
Yeah, you're nocturnal?
And... and you got business to biz
- and... and papers to file.
- [cries]
- Oh, what else you gotta do?
- What else you gotta do, little night owl?
[wailing]
- Little night owl, you got...
- Aww...
You got what? Em... employees to fire!
- You got employees to fire? No!
- Okay.
- Okay, we won't fire employees, no.
- We won't.
No, no. Sh, sh.
- Sh, sh, sh.
- [gasps] Sh, sh, sh.
[both] Sh, sh, sh...
- [cooing]
- Yeah?
[pump whirring]
[Nat sniffles]
- Nat, you okay?
- Yep.
- Okay, that doesn't sound okay.
- [sighs] Yeah.
- What is it?
- It's just the hormones.
- And I'm...
- Okay. I know.
Okay.
I want you to know that this...
this is normal.
This doesn't feel normal.
Well, it is.
- Okay.
- Okay.
There's this thing that happens when
you get pregnant. No one talks about this.
But you... you mourn a little bit.
You mourn, you know,
the person that you used to be.
Because the fact is,
no matter how much you wanna be a mom,
you're never not going to be one again.
- [inhales]
- [chuckling] Not to freak you...
- Okay.
- It's a...
That is a huge brain adjustment.
You are letting go of your old self.
[sobs] Yeah.
But Dad and I are there for you,
no matter what.
All right. We are almost done.
[knocking at door]
What's going on? Everything okay?
- Haircut.
- [Gabe] Oh.
I felt disgusting.
And we're actively dealing with it, right?
[Nat] Right.
Take a look at this.
There's still a little bit,
but what do you think of this length?
Oh boy! That looks great!
I look like a mom.
And that's a good thing, right?
Mom jeans, dad bods.
- Parenting is cool now, right?
- [Nat] No.
Doesn't mean a "mom"
just 'cause it's that length.
I don't want to look like one.
- Wow.
- This looks bad. I hate it.
I loved it when you had
that haircut at her age. Loved it.
You loved everything about me
when I was her age.
- I love everything about you at every age.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Prove it.
Okay.
- [laughs]
- [Gabe] Can you guys give us a moment?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
We will be in our room. You look cute.
I can do, you know,
some point cutting to even...
I think it looks nice.
[door closes]
[Gabe] What's up? Hmm?
Talk to me. I know it's not...
I know it's not the hair.
I just feel like
I don't have a life anymore.
Mm.
Because I don't draw.
I don't see my friends.
I don't do anything. I feel like...
[scoffs]
I'm just this.
No, no, no, no. No, you're...
You're everything.
- Hmm.
- You are. You are.
You're doing so much, and... and...
you're doing it on, like, two hours
of sleep every three days.
It's incredible.
You're... you're literally keeping
a small little human alive
just on your own.
You're doing an amazing job.
And this is gonna be
the toughest thing you ever do in life.
Ever.
When you get through this,
and you will get through this,
you're gonna take off like if Elon
built you himself, whoosh, like a rocket.
I promise you! [laughing]
And you look beautiful,
like you always do.
Here we go!
- Half a cake for half a birthday!
- [Gabe] Whoa!
[Tina] Look what's coming!
- That is unbelievable.
- Wow!
[Rick] Look at that!
[Tina] Look at her face.
She doesn't even know what to do.
- [Rick] Can you believe that?
- [Nat] Wow!
- [Tina] That's a cake!
- [Gabe] You want some? Oh!
- Want some cake?
- Sh, sh!
- [Tina] That's for you, bubby.
- Look, Ro!
[Rick] This little old lady!
You're half a year old!
Oh yeah!
[all laugh]
[Tina] Hi!
- [Nat] You want some cake, Ro?
- Here we go.
- Everybody ready?
- There we go.
- Aww!
- Okay. I don't wanna crop Gabe out.
Get in there. Okay, you ready?
- There you go!
- Here we go!
- Aah! Yeah!
- One, two, three, yeah!
[Lucy] Hannah!
- Hannah, I need coffee right away.
- [door slams]
[Hannah] She's always upset
about the goat legs.
Hi. Um, I have just a couple ideas
for Billy. The...
I didn't ask for ideas.
I asked for coffee.
Yes.
[Nat] I tried to show her.
She just doesn't see me as an artist.
I didn't think it would be so difficult.
Maybe I should leave and become a barista.
I don't know.
Have you ever considered leaving?
Uh... [laughs]
Actually, I, um...
You know, I got a job, another job.
- Uh...
- You did?
Yeah. I don't know
if I'm gonna take it, though.
It's a small documentary
production company.
A lateral move, at best. Pay cut.
Although technically,
I would be a producer.
You would be a producer?
Yeah, but like a baby producer. It...
You should do it. You should...
This is moving in the direction
you wanna move in. Take the job.
They're shooting a heli-ski documentary.
You know what heli-skiing is?
- No.
- It's jumping-out-of-helicopters skiing.
- I'd get to...
- Oh! You would do this?
- Not me, but I'd go with the guys who do.
- Watch people do it.
Yeah. I'll get to go to Switzerland and...
Oh God, Alaska, Chile, Japan, hopefully.
I hope I get to go to Japan.
I always wanted to go.
Oh my God!
This movie...
this movie...
The animation director of this movie,
her work is so beautiful.
When I first saw it,
it... it, like, gave me the same feeling
as when I first saw Spirited Away.
- Ah!
- You know?
- Love Spirited Away.
- Mm-hmm?
I've... I've been saying for years,
somebody should make
a live-action remake of Spirited Away.
You have not been saying that for years.
- Yes. What's wrong with that?
- No. Oh my God.
- What's the matter with that?
- No!
- What's wrong with a remake?
- I'm walking away.
Wha...
What do you...
What's... what's so bad about that?
Okay.
Making...
a live-action remake
of an animated film
is like trying to tell somebody
about your dream that you had last night.
The magic never translates.
It never works.
Okay, so you... you don't think
there's any value in taking one story
and telling it two different ways?
Why do you need a live-action version
when the animated interpretation
is always so much more beautiful?
It conveys what reality can't.
You're saying that there is
no live-action remake of an animated film
that isn't as good
or a little bit better than the original?
- Not one?
- Name... name one.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Boom.
[laughs] 2014?
No, not 2014.1990.
Oh!
There are more, by the way.
I could name you more.
Well, please.
- If I had my notes in front of me.
- [laughs]
Okay.
I got 'em.
[giggling]
[laughing] Okay. Um...
Okay. So I see myself
in one just above Sunset.
Mm. House in the Hills. Classic.
Mm...
But also an animation studio
just off the PCH.
Oh, the traffic's gonna be a nightmare.
That's okay.
I will have a studio off the PCH.
That's true. Right.
Close to the beach. That's good.
Oh!
Yeah. What about you?
Aah... I'm a man of simple tastes.
I just need a small production studio,
you know.
- Fifty, sixty employees, you know.
- [laughs]
Four-bedroom apartment directly above it.
So you want a...
a bougie high-rise in Brentwood
or just, like, a $30 million
sprawling mansion.
Mid-century?
No. No, no. Not at all.
- Oh, thank God.
- No, um...
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, no, no.
I... I want something,
you know, warm and soulful. Um...
My friend once described me
as a blueberry muffin.
- [laughs]
- So I need something sort of...
[whispers] I love muffins.
[chuckles]...in keeping with that.
I'm thinking, like,
a Spanish bungalow, you know,
rooted in the past
but with an eye towards the future.
- I just made that up.
- I love that.
[laughs]
- Five years, you think?
- Mm... Probably six.
Six. Sounds more realistic.
- It's... Things take a while here.
- Yeah. Some things.
So how do we get there?
You know, how do we make this happen?
How do we achieve these things?
- "We"?
- Yeah. Oh, well...
- "We," as in individual "we's."
- Right.
What?
You know, when I moved to LA, um...
I moved to LA because I thought I had to.
- Yeah.
- You know? For work.
Mm-hmm.
I just realized I've spent
so much of the time since I've been here
trying to convince myself that
this was the place I was supposed to be.
Mm.
I don't feel that way anymore.
I feel like this is definitely
where I'm supposed to be.
This feels like where I'm supposed to be.
Good.
[sprinkler running]
Shh!
[Cara] Oh!
Oh.
Hi, I'm Jake.
- Cara.
- Nice to meet you, Cara.
It's good to be met.
I was just leaving.
Oh, yeah.
I'm glad I got to meet you.
Hi!
- [chuckles] Hey, what's up?
- Hi. I brought you a housewarming gift.
- Oh, wow, you shouldn't have. This is...
- For both of us.
- To share.
- Hmm...
[Gabe] I don't remember the last time
we both had a night off.
I know. Congratulations. Cheers.
- Cheers.
- This place is really great. Mm.
Thank you.
Look it! You have your own little...
You've got such a nice space.
- Yeah.
- Your own little practice space!
Well, I'm gonna be
my neighbors' favorite, so...
Uh, you know what? They're lucky.
- They're lucky to hear you play.
- Are they?
- You're gonna go at it. Okay.
- Yeah.
- Put this foot over there.
- What do I do? Oh.
- That foot there...
- [cymbal clangs]
This is...
- God.
[kick drum thumping]
You gotta really kick it. Kick it.
- Kick it like you mean it.
- It scares me.
- Kick it like you mean it. It's gonna...
- [kick drum thumping]
Okay. Now, let's go with a soft roll.
Speed it up, speed it up!
Whoa, hold on.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Uh...
Let's, uh... let's talk about...
Let's talk about this.
Uh... [chuckles]
Okay.
For a minute.
- Yeah.
- You know, because last time,
we said it wasn't gonna be a big deal,
and then it was, like,
the biggest deal ever.
And it could be even bigger
now that Rosie's... involved.
So...
Yeah, yeah, it definitely... It can... Um...
Which is why I was just kind of...
I was thinking that maybe
you and Ro could move in here with me.
No pressure, but you could set up
your little art studio right there,
and there's, like, two good schools
in the neighborhood for Ro.
Um... If we're thinking that far ahead,
I think it would be... would be prudent
to think about where she goes to school.
Um...
Okay, uh, it just seems like...
I can barely keep my head above water
as it is,
and the idea of moving
and not having my parents...
We could be doing that stuff together,
you know, just...
just as... as co-parents or...
just as... just as parents.
What's the worst thing that could happen?
You know, we could give this a real shot
and... and see where it goes.
This could end badly.
Gabe, you and I, we're so different...
- Is that a bad thing?
- I don't want to lose this.
What if we can never go back to this?
This is... this is good. This works.
What if, what if, what if, what if...
What if it works well? What if it...
What if it works amazing?
What if it just is the beginning of, like...
this beautiful thing that we create?
You know, like, what if that?
What if Ro gets to be
with both of her parents... together?
I'm scared. I'm sorry.
I can't. I'm...
I don't... I can't risk this.
I don't wanna risk this.
Just for Ro. I'm sorry. I can't.
That's...
I get it. Um...
Just because I'm not ready
doesn't mean you can't be ready.
Enjoy this space, you know?
- Yeah. I mean...
- Go start dating!
- Dating...
- Or not. I don't know.
No, I...
If you want.
Okay.
Okay.
...'cause she is so cute!
Come here, baby girl!
- Oh, big burp! Big burp!
- Oh, go to Momma.
- [babbling]
- Huh.
I miss you.
[Nat] I miss you.
- I miss you too. A lot.
- Mm-hmm.
[Rosie babbling]
- Oh! Wait, I remember this.
- [sighs]
You were always the most organized person
in the world with this thing.
They're just doodles.
[squeakily] They're just doodles!
Just doodles?
No, these are...
These are so good. Who is this guy?
So, when Ro was first born,
she had her days and nights mixed up.
So we started calling her
our little night owl. Boop!
Beep!
And Gabe does this little voice with her
where he makes her say things as the owl,
and it's... it's just the cutest
and cringiest thing you've ever seen.
[squeakily] Isn't that right?
So Gabe got his own place?
- Uh-huh.
- How's that been?
Um, it sucks.
Um, he offered to stay,
but I actually told him
to go and get his own space and bed
- and to put some women in it.
- [Rosie chuckles]
- Wait, it was... it was your idea?
- Yeah, it was mine.
- Wh... why would you do that?
- I don't know.
I was overwhelmed.
I started seeing him
as, like, this man for the first time,
- and it was scary and overwhelming.
- [babbling]
And, um...
And I screwed up! I screwed up!
Gimme a little smoochy! [kissing]
- [babbling]
- [sighs]
- [Nat] You gotta keep goin'.
- Okay!
[Nat gasps]
- Did you get one? Can I have one?
- Yes, you can have one.
Oh!
[Jake] Oh! That's... that's my poster.
[laughs] That's my name!
Stand by the poster.
[camera clicks]
[Nat] Look. Wanna go see that?
- Are you gonna go see that?
- [Rosie] Yes.
- Don't do it.
- I don't have a technique, but I could...
I thought you were gonna say,
"I don't have a tongue." [laughs]
I'm gonna be the lead producer
on the Sable Island project.
- You are?
- Yeah. It's never gonna happen.
- It won't get funded.
- Don't say that.
- It's cool that it's my project.
- It is. Oh my God! That's amazing!
And I was thinking maybe
we could look for a place together.
You and me move... Get a place together?
- You know... Yeah, unless you don't want to.
- No, no, I...
I want to. You wanna... you want to?
- Then let's do it.
- I think we should do it.
I'll start looking.
Aww!
This... I can't...
This thing's defective. I...
Seriously?
[Rick] Oh, oh! I'm just trying
to get the mud off your foot.
- I'm sorry!
- [kids laughing]
[Rick] She's almost as cute
as Natalie was as a baby.
[Tina] We made that baby.
I mean, through one other baby.
- I get it. I follow.
- Yeah. Okay.
[Rick] How you doin', buddy?
[Gabe] Pretty good.
- Hey, Gabe!
- All right...
- Hey.
- Oh, hey!
Who's that?
I think that's Miranda. His new lady.
- No kiddin'.
- She's cute.
[child] I want big bubbles!
- [Rick] That's nice she's here.
- [Tina] Yeah.
- Good for him.
- I know.
[Miranda] What have you got...
- [Gabe] Nothing...
- Hi!
Hi.
Can I talk to you inside for two seconds?
What's up?
I just didn't know
that Miranda was gonna be here today.
You... you told me to bring a guest.
Yeah, but I just don't know her,
and now she's at my parents' house...
And?
Now she knows that I live with my parents,
and that just is weird to me.
Why wouldn't she?
She's in my life.
And I want her to be in ours.
Get to know Rosie.
But, um... I do have to thank you, though.
For what?
Um...
Well, if it wasn't for you...
telling me to get out there
and start dating again, I...
I wouldn't have met her, so thank you.
Well, then, you're welcome.
[Nat chuckles]
[door opens]
- [door closes]
- [woman] Oh, that was fun.
Yeah.
- [Cara] Okay, bye.
- [woman laughs]
- Right up. Yep.
- Okay. See ya.
[chuckles]
Bye.
[Jake] Well, well, well.
Nice.
[Cara] Yeah. You know?
Things do be moving fast around here.
Gotta keep up. Whew! [chuckles]
I was gonna eat that.
- It's okay. We have more.
- Do you?
- Yeah, in the kitchen.
- I'll get some. Want somethin'?
No, I'm okay. Oh, wait! But wait, hold on.
I wanna show you something.
I'm gonna show Lucy my portfolio,
and I want
your brutally honest opinion, please.
- Hell, yes.
- Take a look.
[sighs]
You just swipe.
[Nat chuckles]
[Jake] Wow.
These are great.
- Yeah?
- When are you gonna show her?
- Soon. Sometime soon.
- Uh-huh.
You should 'cause
you're gonna wrap soon, right?
- Yeah?
- She'll be staffing up her next project.
- You want her thinkin' of you.
- True.
I don't know. It's hard to,
like, sell myself in that way.
You have to ask for what you want.
Okay?
["Bado Mapema (Simama)"
by Blinky Bill playing]
Lucy?
Lucy?
Yes. Yes.
- [switches music off]
- Sorry.
- Is this the new song for the end?
- It is, it is. Do you like it?
- I do.
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.
- Amazing.
Well, please tell the team
that we are locking the final sequence!
- Yay!
- Yes!
Uh...
Now that you maybe have a spare moment,
would you be able to look at my portfolio?
If you have the time...
Absolutely. I would love to.
Just please send me the link.
Thank you. Thank you.
But she hasn't even opened the link.
[Jake] You gotta give people a month
before you follow up.
- A month?
- Yes, a month.
What the hell are people doing?
Oh, did you see the, um...
the Highland Park one?
It has a cute tile bathroom, and it's,
like, a walk away from Donut Friend,
which is... nice.
Did you... What?
Uh...
We got the funding
for the Sable Island project.
Okay.
I'm gonna have to go to Nova Scotia.
- Oh, well...
- For six months.
For six months?
- Or maybe a year.
- Oh my God.
Yeah.
- Ah, it's just bad timing.
- Yeah.
So we're not
looking for an apartment, then?
I mean...
we can still.
- I just...
- You won't...
You just won't be living in it.
Yeah.
- It's okay. Hey. It's okay. It's fi...
- I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.
This is so great for you.
We'll make it work.
I'm not worried about it.
Okay.
- Let's get ice cream.
- Okay.
[Nat sighs]
- Bye, babe.
- Bye.
[chuckles] Whee!
Okay. I'll see you soon, okay? Mwah!
Go ahead.
Have fun while I'm away.
Let's go.
[car starts]
- [gasps] Hi!
- [Cara] Hey!
You made it!
- Yeah, only took me four years.
- Mm!
- I got the invite to Nicole's baby shower.
- Yeah.
- You gonna go to that?
- I have to go. I live a block away.
- Right. Well, if you're going, I'll go.
- Mm! I'll get to see you again!
Yeah! [laughs]
I guess.
Thank you for having me here.
Yeah! Course!
Yeah, but...
I needed to get away,
and I'm just thankful to be here.
I love having you here.
And literally, any time, by the way.
You know. My couch is your couch.
This is your home too, okay?
Thank you. I'm gonna get some juice.
Do you want any?
No, I'm okay.
Be right back.
Okay.
- Oh shit.
- Oh God. I am so sorry.
No, it's okay. Um...
- It's fine. No, don't worry about it.
- Aah... There.
They're old. It's fine.
Seriously, it's fine.
You shouldn't have said that.
I was gonna insist
on buying you a round of drinks.
Oh, well, then, you know,
they're actually vintage and priceless.
- I love it a lot. So...
- Yeah. That's what I thought. I...
I deeply apologize,
and I owe you a round of drinks.
- You actually don't have to.
- No, I'm going to.
- Oh, okay.
- And sorry again.
Thank you.
I would love to grab that table some...
[chuckles]
I really cannot imagine
what my life would have been like here.
- What?
- Mm-mm.
- That's a lie.
- No, 'cause it's very overwhelming.
Whatever. Wasn't meant to be.
You were supposed to go
and have your gorgeous family.
Yeah.
I said I found a really good place
that's near here.
Uh...
Aah, sorry, I can't...
Hello?
Um, I miss you.
I... I miss you too! I miss you!
I'm telling you about the apartment.
I emailed you. It's...
I can't hear what you're saying. Sorry.
- It has a really cute studio space for me.
- [voice breaking up]
Can you hear me?
[loud whirring]
[whirring continues]
[whirring stops]
Hey.
Uh, Blue Bottle?
What?
Uh... Coffee?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Thank you.
- [sighs]
- [phone ringing]
Mm.
Hi, good morning!
[Rosie] Mommy!
How are you, baby?
Good.
Good. I miss you.
Can I speak to your dad for a second?
Daddy's not here.
No? Where is he?
Daddy said Jessie's in charge.
Who's Jessie?
[giggles] She's a girl.
Has she been with you all night?
Yeah, she slept on the couch.
I miss you. When are you coming home?
I'm gonna come.
I'm gonna come, gonna see you soon. Okay?
Okay. Love you. I'll see you soon.
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, Ro.
What the fuck?
[call ringing]
Yo, this is Gabe. Leave your message.
- [beeps]
- Gabe, call me back right now.
Hey. Morning.
[sighing] Hi.
Should we maybe get some brunch
before we go to the beach?
I think I have to go. Home.
I think I have to go home.
[Cara] Wh...
Like...
- Uh... Like Texas?
- Yeah.
- You just got here.
- No, I know.
Uh...
Rosie just called me.
She doesn't know where Gabe is.
I don't know where Gabe is.
He's not answering his phone.
She's with a sitter.
She was with a sitter all night.
Oh, she's with... she's with a sitter?
Yeah, but I don't know her.
I don't know who this person is.
Do you have to go home, though?
- I mean, I just took the week off work...
- I know. Yeah. No. I know.
- Like, we were gonna go and brunch and...
- Rosie... Rosie just takes precedence over...
brunch and going to the beach, you know?
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Yeah. [chuckles]
- Hey.
- [girlfriend] Some coffee?
Yeah, thanks.
[clears throat]
[girlfriend] Wanna go to the beach?
- [Cara] Yeah.
- Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
[girlfriend] Do you wanna get brunch?
[Cara] Um...
You had a few days.
Hey, it's so much...
[zips]
- [Lucy] Natalie?
- Yeah?
In my office, please.
Yeah.
Yes?
Have a seat.
[sighs]
I'm gonna be really honest.
Okay.
[typing]
There's definitely some skill there.
Nice perspective, beautiful shading...
Thank you.
...but it, um... it feels a little derivative.
Oh, actually, a lot derivative.
Okay, what do you mean?
Like you use some algorithm.
You see, you're smart.
You've done the work. That's a good thing.
That is a great thing.
But it seems to me that you are drawing
what you think you should draw,
based on what already is.
You see, I see Barbera.
I see Chuck Jones.
I see Tissa David.
I even see a bit of myself,
but I don't see you in any of this.
Okay.
Maybe...
maybe you could help me find... my voice?
"Help you find your voice."
You know, I was an assistant at Pixar
for many years.
And I learned a lot. It was great.
But the biggest lesson that I learned
was that I was spending so much time
helping other people find their voice
that I had no time to find my own.
And one day, I just quit,
and I took a shit job
that I didn't have to take home,
and all I did every single day
was find my voice.
I didn't have a mentor.
I didn't have any help.
Do you understand?
Are you trying to tell me I should quit?
I'm telling you that
everybody has that moment in their life
where they have to decide
what's most important to them.
This.
This is... what's most important to me.
Then this is the moment.
[typing]
[Jake] She fired you?
No, but she basically told me that
all my work was unoriginal, uninspired,
and that I was copying other artists,
and that I should basically just quit.
Are you listening to me?
Yes. Yeah. I'm... I'm sorry, Nat. That's...
- [sniffles]
- That's really unfair.
Okay, uh, what I'll do is, when I...
when I get a second, I'll, um, call Jenny.
- She had some leads for me...
- No! Please don't call Jenny.
I don't want you to help.
I'm just trying to vent to you.
I just wanna talk to my boyfriend
and feel comforted.
I just wanna connect with you,
because I feel like that doesn't really
happen very much these days.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Um...
I've created space for you.
I've sent you apartment listings.
You don't even look at them.
You don't even answer me.
I'm trying to create a home
and a life with you. I wish you would...
I wish you would want
to include me in your plan.
Nat, I'm here on the phone with you.
I'm talking to you. I...
[groans] It is a ridiculous day here,
and I'm freezing my ass off,
and I'm on the other side
of the continent.
But I'm here, I'm talking to you.
I don't know what more you want from me.
I'm... I'm doing my best here.
I know it sucks, but...
Maybe you are exactly
where you're supposed to be.
But right now, that is not with me.
This isn't working. It's just not working.
[sniffles]
[sighs]
Right, well, if you feel
like it's not working,
then it's not working. I'm sorry.
[sniffles]
Okay. Bye.
[knocking]
[door opens]
Yeah. Hi.
Hi, Ro! Hi, baby!
- Hi, baby girl!
- Mommy!
Hi! I missed you!
- Are you drawing?
- Yes.
Oh my God. It's so beautiful.
- Can you get your stuff? We're going home.
- Okay.
Get your stuff, and we'll go.
And get your toys too.
All right. What's up?
You left our daughter alone
with someone that I don't know?
- Not alone. With Miranda's sister.
- Yeah, I know.
You left her overnight
with a sitter I've never met.
- With Miranda's sister.
- Great, Gabe. I asked for one weekend.
One weekend
so I can visit my friend in LA.
- One weekend.
- No one told you to end your trip early
- and come in and start shouting!
- No, no!
- Call...
- My daughter called me.
And I had to come home
to take care of her.
- I'm sorry, plans changed.
- What...
- She wasn't supposed to stay overnight.
- Something took precedence?
- You couldn't trust me?
- No. I had to come home.
- You're the only one that's responsible.
- Yeah.
Yeah, well, I proposed to Miranda.
That's what happened.
That's what spilled over.
Just some willy-nilly plan.
Just... Yeah, just a proposal.
[laughs] Oh my...
Okay.
[chuckles] That's all you...
"Okay"? Okay, cool.
Cool. Cool.

when we found out.

Are you kidding me?
We always talked about
living in LA together.

I'm gonna be living with you until I'm 40

I was asked to be on a panel

- What?
- Yeah.
It's nothing fancy,
but it's some animators...
- Local talent...
- Are you kidding me? That's crazy!
- [laughing]
- Wow, are you... Nat. Oh my God.
- Yeah.
- That's...
Yeah, yes.
It's... happened very fast
after happening very slowly.
Yeah.

Well, I'll... I'll be there,
and Rosie will too.
Mm-hmm.
Our manager, he's actually...
He's trying to set us up
with a gig at South-by, also.
So we'll try to maybe
line up, uh... the same weekend.
Your band is gonna play South-by?
Trying to.
I would love to see you play again.
I'd love that.

Hi, Jake.
I was hoping that I would reach you,
but, um... but it's okay.
I just wanted to let you know that
a short that I made got into South-by.
And, um...
I'm really excited and, uh, proud, so...
I think you're the one person in my life
who really understands
what this means to me.
So I just wanted to let you know.

- Hi.

Should I shave my hair off?

- You do?
- Yes!

- [woman] Yeah!
[woman] Yeah, next.
Hi. Natalie Bennett.
[woman] Here you go.
Thank you.
[woman] You're welcome.
- [woman] Hi!
- Natalie Bennett.
[woman] Here you go. That's yours.
- Thank you.
- [woman] You're welcome.
[Lucy] So you mentioned that Night Owl
was inspired
by your daughter's bedtime routine.
[laughter]
[Nat] Yeah. So the first few months,
she was basically nocturnal.
We were out of our minds,
and somewhere in there,
we started calling her
our "little night owl."
- [audience] Aww!
- There...
Normally, there was
an expletive thrown in there.
"Our little bleeping night owl!"
Cover your ears, baby.
- [Lucy] She's so cute.
- [Nat] Thank you.
Uh, anyways, her dad and I would joke
that she must be having anxiety
about all the things
she had to do the next day,
and it became a whole routine
where she was our overwhelmed,
stressed-out little zoot-suit-wearing owl,
and it was an inside joke.
We thought it was hilarious,
but we weren't sure if anyone else
would really find it amusing.
For myself, I do know
what it feels like to stay up all night
worried about the hundred things
that I have to take care of the next day.
Well, you can always call me
because I'm always awake.
- Okay. Maybe I'll do that!
- [laughter]
- Great!
- It's so lovely to have you here today.
- Go, Mom!
- [Nat] Thank you, I appreciate it.

- I did not believe you.
- You said I was a dry cleaner.
Unreal. Way to go.

Yeah, I'm good.

obviously, but, um...

[Jake] Does anybody have
a spare ticket to this thing?
That they're...
Tickets that they're not using?
Extra tickets? Anybody have a ticket?
Do you have a ticket you're not using?
- Extra ticket, maybe?
- No, I'm sorry.
Does anybody have a spare ticket
they might be willing to give me?
[Nat] Jake?
Hi.
Wow, you look...
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, uh... I was trying to surprise you.
This is not exactly how I planned this.
- Yeah.
- But my flight got delayed in Toronto.
I just got here.
I didn't expect it to be sold out.
It's sold out.
That's tremendous! Well done!
You... came here for...
Your work let you come here?
Oh, no, no. Yes, technically, they did,
but, um... they weren't happy about it.
A lot of, uh... lot of angry conversations.
A couple of angry phone calls.
One or two angry voice mails
I think I'm gonna have
when I turn my phone back on.
I gotta do what I gotta do.
Mm.
[Jake sighs]
And I got your voice mail.
And the truth is,
I'd rather be here for you
than anywhere else in the world for me.

Hi, Lucy. I didn't know
you were gonna be here.
Oh, I was on a panel earlier,
and I saw your name on the program.
I wanted to come and say hello.
- I appreciate that. Thank you.
- Mm.
I know I was hard on you.
In the same way that people
were hard on me when I first started.
It's a hard industry.
It is.
I could have done more.
You know, maybe you did
exactly what I needed you to do.
Well, either way, you found your voice.
- [chuckles]
- I'm very proud of you.
I wondered if you'd consider
coming by my office
when you get back to Los Angeles,
because I'd love to see
what you're working on next.
Yes. Yes! I would love that.
Thank you, Lucy.
- You're welcome.
- [laughs]
- I'll see you then.
- Yes.
Do you remember
the last time we were on this bridge?
Mm-hmm. Where it all started.
Where it all started.
That night, you said...
that you would be there for me.
And you have been, every step of the way.
Well, I've tried my best.
Well, you've been the greatest partner
in all of this.
- Oh, stop it.
- No, I'm not gonna st...
No.
You know, I've told myself all this time
that we should not be together...
because maybe we were
holding each other back from something,
and If things didn't work out, it would be
too complicated with Rosie, but I...
I don't want to worry about
if it doesn't work out,
because what if it does?
And I have been so stupidly
in love with you this whole time.
Finally.
Finally?
Finally?
Finally.
[laughs]
[Jake] Wow.
- [laughs]
- That's so cool.
Can you wait here for two seconds?
- Are you gonna go in?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Will you hold these?
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.
- I'll be here.
[Nat] I need to...
Thank God you haven't,
because that's another...
- You're doing it with me this time.
- I know.
- Will you give me a minute?
- Yeah.
You're okay.
You're okay.
