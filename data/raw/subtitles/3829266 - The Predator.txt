Do you got eyes
on the hostages?
Still negative.
DUPREE (ON RADIO): 20 bucks
says they don't show.
You two morons
really making bets
on whether a drug cartel
has executed these hostages?
DUPREE: Abso-fucking-lutely.
HAINES: I believe
that was implied. Yeah.
Just checking. I'm in for 20.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

No crosswind.

Hi, there.
Does, uh, Quinn McKenna
live here?
His post office box payments
are past due.
Department of Defense.
He works for the government,
does he?
MOS-1-1-B-3-V-W-3.
Military designation.
- Ah.
- He kills people...
so you can be a mailman.
Dr. Brackett?
I understand
you enjoy stargazing?
My men
will take care of your dog.
Will you come with me, please?
What am I looking at?
It's exactly
what you think it is. Yeah.
They've been here before.
'87. '97.
Lately, the visits
are increasing in frequency.
EMILY: Rory, I'm home!
Hey, I got you something.
Hey.
Did you do
one of these after school?
I did all of them.
Oh. Okay.
Well, I got you two options.
We have...
pirate, or...
Frankenstein.
Frankenstein,
you know, green skin?
Threw a girl
to see if she would float?
No. Okay.
Well, let's go with pirate.
Yeah?
This is dumb.
The guys will...
They will still
be able to see.
See what?
That it's me.
PSYCHOLOGIST: You were once
quoted as saying,
"I dropped
from my mother's womb...
I hit the floor...
and I started crawling
through hostile territory
toward my grave."
(LAUGHING)
QUINN: About right, yeah.
- That's badass.
- It's pretty morbid.
It's pretty dark.
What's with the polygraph?
I thought
this was a psych eval.
We need to know
if you pose a threat.
Oh, I'm a sniper.
Isn't posing a threat
kind of the fucking point?
You spend most of your time
now in-country...
estranged from your wife
and son?
(SIGHS)
Look, I get it.
Something went down in Mexico
and nobody wants any witnesses.
Excuse me?
You're not here
to find out if I'm crazy.
You wanna make sure
the label sticks.
So, you feel
you're being railroaded?
I can see the tracks
on the floor!
I don't see tracks
on the floor, for the record.
You feel
like you're a stranger
on your own planet,
don't you, Captain?
Like an alien, you mean?
That's what you wanted.
Do I get a cookie now?
He saw something.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
Wow!
Ow.

(DEVICE TRILLING)
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

(BAXLEY MUMBLES)

You all right over there?
No, don't worry about him.
He's just got Tourettes.

- Fuck you, Coyle.
You get used to it, bro.
Welcome to Group Two.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
Like a unit?
No, group. Group Two.
Group therapy, room two.
Oh.
- McKenna.
- Nebraska Williams.
That's your real name?
Gaylord.
- That's a good call, then.
- Yeah, I thought so.
(CHUCKLES)
Where did you serve?
Operation
Enduring Freedom, '03.
Went for the Taliban,
stayed for the opium.
(LAUGHING)
That's Coyle.
Friendly fire incident.
Got turned around, fired
at one of his own vehicles.
Now, he tells jokes.
(COYLE CLEARS THROAT)
- (THUDS)
- (GRUNTS) That's Lynch.
Got a medal for blowing up

Don't.
That's Nettles.
(STUTTERS) Okay, I'm Nettles.
Did three tours flying Hueys.
He loves his Bible.
Hey, Netty?
Is it end times yet?
Yeah, laugh all you want.
But when you're standing at
attention before your Maker...
I always stand at attention
before I make her.
- (WHISTLES)
- (LAUGHTER)
God makes shitty people.
Yeah.
I mean, why do you think
people make war?
Why, Baxley?
Why do we make war?
- Come on, Baxley!
- Because fuck-cock-cock!
- Because we fuck cock-cock?
- Yes, we fuck cocks.
That's it,
because we fuck cocks,
that's why. We get upset.
How'd you snag a ticket
on this shitmobile?
Put a bullet in a CO.
Any particular reason?
He was an asshole.
Keep your head down.
Here, throw this on.

AUTOMATED VOICE:
Your attention, please.
The GRC meeting has been moved

Aha! There you are!
Welcome.
I'm Sean Keyes.
Wow. I heard you basically
wrote the book
on evolutionary biology.
Um, I'm sorry, can I just...
Is that...?
Oh, my God!
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Holy shit.
That's alien technology.
This is what
you brought me here to see?
KEYES: Well, yeah.
Can I... Can I see this?
Can I get into this?
Doc.
Let's go.
(INDISTINCT PA ANNOUNCEMENT)
- TRAEGER: Everything good?
- Yes, sir.
TRAEGER: What is it?
Dr. Brackett.
Would you like
to meet a Predator?
(CHUCKLES) Come on.
WOMAN (ON PA):
Please observe
decontamination protocol.
KEYES: So, how'd they
rope you into this?
I wrote a letter to
the president when I was six.
Told him how much
I loved animals,
and that if NASA
ever found a space animal,
they should call me.
Couple years ago,
I was put on a short list
for a paper
I wrote on hybrid strains.
Computer cross-referenced
the letter, and... here I am.
(MACHINE WHIRRING)
Dr. Brackett.
Thanks for coming.
I'm sure you have questions.
- Oh. Just two, actually.
- Okay.
Why do you call it
"the Predator"?
It's a nickname.
You know, the data suggests
that it tracks its prey.
Exploits weakness.
Seems to...
well, enjoy it.
Like a game.
That's not a predator,
that's a sports hunter.
Sorry?
A predator
kills its prey to survive.
I mean, what you're describing
is more like a bass fisherman.
Well, we took a vote.
Predator's cooler, right?
- SAPIR: Fuck yeah.
- Fuck yeah.
Found his escape pod
in Mexico.
Still looking
for the ship he came in.
He's heavily sedated.
You are
one beautiful motherfucker.
I'm gonna guess your second
question is, why are you here?
Our test results yielded
something a little... odd.
(SCOFFS) Is this a joke?
KEYES: We ran the genome
sequence ten times.
This specimen has...
- Human DNA?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Look, we know
about spontaneous speciation.
Mostly plants and insects,
but...
But some mammals,
sheep, goats, uh...
Yeah.
KEYES: The red wolf
is known to be a hybrid
between the coyote
and the grey wolf...
Or possibly some form of
recombinant technology...
Guys, guys, guys.
I get it, I get it.
You wanna know
if someone fucked an alien?
Yeah.
Okay, it's got some kind of
atmospheric mask,
biohelmet, and...
What are these? Like,
some kind of wrist gauntlets?
Exactly.
So, where's the helmet
and the other gauntlet?
We've looked, believe me.
Who is this?
He made first contact
with the Predator.
Great.
I'd like to talk to him.
Well, he's
being evaluated, so...
Okay.
Well, before
you lobotomize him,
I'd like to ask him
a few questions.
MAN (ON RADIO):
We have a request to reroute.
OFFICER: Read you

Starkweather Dam.
Proceed at once.
You'll be met

Oh.

GENERAL (SIGHS): Damn it.
We need something in the air.
Get me NORAD.
I feel like I'm missing
something in the research.
There's something
I'm just not seeing.
Look, if this is
the blood, okay, I think...
can you just tell me
what that is?
Because I was trying
to get into this earlier,
but somebody stopped me.
He gave me the hairy eyeball.
- That guy actually.
- KEYES: Hold that thought.
Sir, NORAD's reporting
a 202 anomaly
possibly heading
our direction.
Is it coming here?
God, I hope not.

(STUTTERS) Eat your pussy.
Wait, what?

No, you just said,

No, you said,

No. I said,

No, that's what he said,

I made a unicorn...
I'm sorry,
it's a piece of shit.
So, what's the upside to me
staying here with you guys?
Uh, maybe staying alive?
We are soldiers.
We're the good guys, okay?
CASEY: Well, that's debatable.
I read your file.
The guys in Mexico it killed?
They yours?
They're gonna need
a patsy for that.
You're looking at him.
Yeah, I figured.
Ex-sniper with PTSD? That's
actually kind of perfect.
How about you telling us
what you were doing
in a secret base.
Surrounded by
trained soldiers. Mercs.
I'm a biologist, and they have
me on call in case there's...
contact.
What did I tell you?
End days. End days.
Nettles, if you don't stop
with this Bible shit,
I'm gonna set you on fire.
Guys, if we wanna
keep breathing,
we need to find this thing.
Expose it.
It's called the Predator.
It hunts people for sport.
Technically, that's not
a predator. That's like...
Thank you.
- It's a hunter.
- I said the same thing.
NETTLES: A sportsman,
or a hunter, or a fisherman.
COYLE: Well, look at you...
I was there when it escaped.
It's looking for something.
Equipment. Weapons.
I took its gear.
What?
You took something
from the thing?
- What?
- So, I'd have evidence.
I think I know
where it's going.

He's not here.
What do you mean,

Oh, shit!
What? So we

No! No! No!
The whole fucking reason
I sent it to a P.O. box,

Oh, no, don't touch me. No.

What happened
to Haines and Dupree?
They're dead.
And the thing that killed them
is out there looking for Rory.
What are you talking about?
There's something out there.
It tore my friends apart.
What is it?
(COYLE STUTTERING)
Like, it's a creature.
Seriously, it's not a person.
Like from the Bible.
- Revelations.
- From the Bible?

It's a space alien.

It's like

(MEN EXCLAIMING)
Hey!
- No.
- No, no, I'm coming with you.
QUINN: No, nix that.
(GUN COCKING)
(QUINN CLEARS THROAT)
Is there a problem?
Thing is, we're
kind of moving targets.
Yeah, in case you haven't
noticed, we're fugitives.
Yeah. Plus, like where are we
gonna get our meds and stuff?
I get it. Fine,
stay here and watch TV.
You know what? If you try
to split? Or draw the Feds?
Or if you jeopardize my son
by your half-assed
yardbird bullshit...
I will come back here,
and I will happily
kill every single
fucking one of you.
WILLIAMS: Come on,
brothers. Let's go.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Seriously?
It's not our fight.
Is your husband
the man I think he is?
Excuse me?
Tell me
about your husband, please?
He's a security
counter-sniper.
- Mmm.
- Army Rangers.
He supervised
23 close precision engagements
across five continents
and he has 13 confirmed kills.
And he is one of only 14
captains in the armed forces,
to ever receive
a Distinguished Service Medal
and the Silver Star.
So, he might be
a lousy husband,
but he is a good soldier.
Well, sounds like he can
probably take care of himself.
- Yeah.
- Jesus Christ.
That's what I thought.
Fucking pussies.
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
Where you going, Nettles?
I didn't like your speech.
It didn't really inspire me.
But... he called me a pussy
and nobody
calls me a pussy, so...
- Fuck off, pussy.
- Okay...
(CLEARS THROAT)
Come on, Bax, let's go.
Let's get some.
Before these army fuckers
screw up the whole thing.
Come on, what are you doing?
Let's move.
Hey!
You too, lucky charms.
LYNCH: Coyle, you wanker.
I'd like to watch TV
- with you sometime.
- Okay.
I liked your speech.
BAXLEY: I liked the couch.
Whoa, what's happening? What?
Well, we're finding my son,
that's what.
All right,
when all this is over...
Fuck me in the face
with an aardvark.
(GROANING)
I just want to be famous.
LYNCH: Ostensibly,
if Forrest Gump
just read the side of the box,
it would tell him exactly
what he would get.
COYLE: You're using
"ostensibly" incorrectly.
Is this for me?
This is like the reverse
of a clown car.
All right, Nebraska,
let's find some wheels,
nothing flashy.
Copy.
All right. Find my son.
Casey, you're with me.
Let's go.

You okay? Huh?

What, is your mom

Nothing.
I'd be careful with that, sir.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
You know what I think?
I think this one
went rogue. A runner.
Hmm. And the big one?
He's a tracker.
Sent to take that one out.
Some kind of interstellar
cops and robbers.
Now he's going after
that missing ship.
And whatever's on board.
I want that fucking ship.
We're in the ballpark.
Captain McKenna's son?
Mother confirms.
He has the operating system.
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Thought it was a video game.
So, we find the kid,
we find the ship.
What the fuck we
still standing here for?
You don't want to know
what that one is?
I know what it is.
Our big boy's a hunter.
He brought his dogs with him.
No, it had to be like
a government experiment
or some shit.
Like a robot, or whatever.
Nettles, are you
fucking retarded, man?
Use another word, would ya?
Yeah, man.
Show a little sensitivity.
His son's retarded.
BAXLEY: Here you go.
Here you go.
He does this from time to time.
Just give him a minute.
Hey, Lynch.
What's the deal
with these two?
Coyle lit up
one of his own vehicles?
Back in '09, yeah.
It was bad business. Six dead.
What, no survivors?
Yeah, there was one.
It's fucking romantic.
Are you kidding me,
they're friends?
Picture it.
Military inquiries,
sitting outside courtroom,
waiting to go in,
side by side,
- day after fucking day.
- After fucking day.
Unbelievable.
It's the loonies.
QUINN: All right, kid.
I've talked to your mother.
She's doing fine.
Mom says you're a killer.
- Well, I'm a soldier.
- (WILLIAMS CLEARS THROAT)
What's the difference?
Well, when you like it,
that's when you're a killer.
- (SNIFFLES)
- Are you good?
Sorry I never grew up.
You know...
the way you wanted.
Tell you a secret.
Truth is, kid,
I never grew up
the way I wanted.
(SIGHS)
Are we gonna get killed?
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)
Nope.
Come on.
(CLEARS THROAT) Get up.
I'm single.
I don't know if you knew that.
No, I could tell
that you're single.
We got so much stuff
in common, you know...
You like music, I like music.
You like music, right?
- Shit.
- What?
This is more than spinal fluid.
What does that mean?
If I'm right,
they're trying
to upgrade themselves.
McKenna, I got something.
I think I know
what they're up to
on Predator World these days.
You see this? They found this
in the Predator's plexus.
So, remember how I told you
how they take
people's spines, right?
Yeah, for trophies.
Yes! Yes!
From the strongest, smartest,
most dangerous species
on every planet they visit.
Collecting survival traits
from the most
high-end specimens.
I think they're
attempting hybridization.
You're just pulling this
out of your ass.
Did you not see
the new Predator?
It's evolving.
Or being upgraded.
QUINN: That little boy
managed to figure out
alien technology.
You know,
a lot of experts say that
being on the spectrum
isn't really a disorder.
It's actually the next step
in the evolutionary chain.
NETTLES: Hey, yo!
What the fuck?
Get the fuck away from me!
Yo! Casey! (WHISTLING)

use it, or something?
Okay, what are we doing?
What are we doing with it?
We're gonna study it. That's
what we're gonna do with it.
What's to learn?
Except Williams sucks
at shooting shit in the head.
Williams, you lobotomized him.
(CHUCKLES)
Okay, new rule.
No one shoots my fucking dog.

It's official.
You were right,
we can use this.

Everybody, tighten up.
- Little man, come here.
- NETTLES: That's an EC-130.
That's not civilian.
Hey, hey, hey!
You are not starting
a firefight with my kid here.

Do you wanna help? Go get
a helicopter and some pyro.
All right! On me!
Now go!

Where is it?
Where's what?
The device.
It goes, right in here.
(GRUNTING)
Okay, so, the first Predator,
Thing One.
Why'd he come here? To Earth?
The "Thing One",
as you called him,
arrived in
a hijacked spacecraft.
We think there's
something on it.
Something he didn't want
his enemies to have.
CASEY: Wait, enemies?
Other Predators.
Like that big one.
So, he brought some what?
Gift for the human race?
I'll help you find it.
We can analyze it...
Shut the fuck up!
Why are they here?
You remember a few years back
when Hostess went bust?
There was a run on Twinkies?
Snapped up
from coast-to-coast.
Get 'em while they still last.
Remember?
How long before climate change
renders this planet unlivable?
Two generations?
One?
CASEY: That's why their visits
are increasing?
They're trying to snap up
all of our best DNA
before we're gone.
Adapt themselves with it
and then move in.
We're an endangered species,
and they know it.
They thrive
in a hothouse environment.
Maybe they want
to move into ours.
And that dead Predator
was bringing us
a way to stop them.
(GRUNTS)
You've hidden this thing
before in the mail.
(GROANS)
So, where is it this time?
Your mother's ass.
Wait, did I say that out loud?
(GRUNTS)
Hey! Hey! Hey! No, no, no.
That is not for you.

What's that?
A map.

Uh, 11, actually.
Used to be a contractor.
This thing is a hybrid?
What does that mean?
Meaning it's the Chinese menu
of DNA.

He will be your leader.

I see you saw Lynch's card.
Baxley had this
the whole time.
Nebraska's bad habit.
Son...
these are the ones
that no one's gonna remember.
Just us.
What do you say
we put them to rest?
(INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT
OVER PA)
Captain McKenna.
Hiroshi Yamada.
- Sir.
- First things first.
I want to say thank you
for having such a great kid.
He loves it here.
Yeah, he's something else.
What do we got, Doctor?
Well, I assume
that you know by now,
but the first Predator,
it didn't come here to hunt us.
- He brought something.
- Exactly.
Now, you want
to hear the good news?
The cargo survived.
With some sort of fail-safe.
Before the upgrade Predator
blew up the ship,
a pod escaped.
Jettisoned.
Saved itself.
It seems that our boy
wasn't taking any chances.
He wanted us to have this.
(DOOR SLIDING OPEN)
(INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT)
What is it again
you do here, exactly?
He's the world's number one
authority on cybernetics.
QUINN: Hey, kiddo.
RORY: Pretty cool, huh?
Pretty cool.
You got your own desk.
I'll make sure to tell Mom.
So, this is his gift
to humankind?

Dad, the pod
sent me a message.
- Rory, what's in that pod?
- Don't know!
Oh, wow... Oh, shit!
- It's got a name!
- Name? What name?
I guess you'd call it,
the Predator Killer.
- QUINN: Get him out of here!
- Come with me. Let's go.
SOLDIER 1: Get back.
Clear the area.
SOLDIER 2: Eyes on it.
(DEVICE TRILLING)
Whatever it is,
it appears to be dormant.
- I assume it needs to be...
- (WOMEN GASP)
SOLDIER: Eyes on.
Keep your weapons trained.
(GASPS) Get it off!
Get it off me!
(SCREAMING)
What the hell is that?
That's my new suit, bubba.
I hope they got it
in a 42 long.
