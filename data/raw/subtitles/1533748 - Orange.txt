Let's break up!
Do you know why?
You're a psycho!
Leave me alone!
I can't love you.
Where is it hiding?
How am I to find it?
Love that's bigger than sea...
Though troubling me...
My heart seeks it...
It's running into the world
of imaginations again...
Every minute for you...
how can I show different face every time?
Brother! Did you see what's he doing?
What's your idea?
Can't you understand from it?
I can't love her any more.
If he doesn't love my daughter,
he mustn't live at all.
Where are you?
Ram has broken off with Janu,
Janu's father is also here.
It's a big fight here.
Did he? Did he break off again?
He's useless guy,
I know very well about him.
Leave the place immediately.
Okay, I'm coming.
Getting out, okay?
Are you leaving?
- We'll say but would we go?
Lets stop him first...stop...stop...
Don't interfere.
What the hell you are!
Listen to me, Ram.
Leave him.
Who are you to interfere?
Who the hell are you?
She's my daughter!
Are you mad or something?
Talking like mad,
what makes you so proud?
Are you Telugu people?
What's happening here?
What's going on here?
I said okay to you because
my daughter loves you.
How dare!
You say you can't love her.
I'm repeating it again,
I can't love her.
Do what so ever you can do.
- Stop!
It's sin to ditch the girl you love.
Any father would create trouble if
anyone falls in love with his daughter.
Why are you fighting with him
for not loving your daughter?
What exactly is your problem?
What?
Look at him! He's the problem!
He looks like he's in problems,
and you say he's the problem.
What's your problem?
I can arrest you all, I'm inquiring
because we all are Telugu people.
Tell me, what's your problem?
My problem? Love!
Love is my problem.
I know there are problems in love,
is love itself a problem to you?
Tell me clearly so that
I can understand.
I was five then...
I love Meenakshi teacher.
Who drew my figure?
Is it you Ram?
Very nice.
Why did you draw me?
What next?
Why are you stopping?
- No...no...not from here.
Where will you start it?
From here.
I was 1 6 then...
The girl's name was Samara.
No...no...not from here too.
Don't stop it...
- Not from here also.
I'm listening.
You said I love you to
a teacher at five,
a girl told you I love you at 1 6,
very interesting, carry on boy.
No, I'll not tell.
- No...
What you're asking and
what's his reply?
He's diverting the problem.
I'm not diverting my problem,
I'm telling you my problem.
Actually, you don't have any
connection with my problem.
Ask him to leave the place.
Stop...stop...please...
- No, he's...
I'm asking him, right?
He's saying something,
let's hear it patiently.
Come...come this side.
I'll tell from here.
Don't start from somewhere else,
tell me about your love with that girl.
The girl's name is Janu,
the moment I fell in love with her...
I want to live with you only.
Tell...tell...
Can I take one flower?
Why did you call me urgently?
We must find that girl.
Can't we avoid this episode?
If this street has so many girls,
think about this area,
how many girls would be there
in this city then?
I'm not interested about these girls,
I'm interested in only one girl.
If you're so clear...
I like the college very much.
Is it from Sanjay?
What's the message? Romance?
When will this happen in my life?
Would I tell him first I love you?
Would he be the first to express it?
Would he fall for me or
would I fall for him?
When will this happen?
If you want it to happen,
first look at them.
Select one of them and
everything will happen on its own.
Co-education is very nice.
Wasted two years in a girls' college.
Look at him! Those chubby cheeks!
Feel like pinching it.
Which department?
What?
Joined the college today.
How did you develop it so well?
I go to the gym every day.
Will you develop chubby cheeks
if you go to gym?
Cheeks?
What if we are from
different departments...
Can I've your number?
He gave his number.
Why are you laughing so much?
I love lion jokes.
Which lion joke did you tell them?
Lion's marriage, lion and
elephant joke, lion and fox...
Lion and ant joke!
- Lion and ant joke?
Never heard it.
- Haven't you? May I?
Come on tell me.
An ant went to forest and
proposed to a lion.
Do you know how?
Lion, I love you!
How dare! Look at your size,
how dare you propose to me.
Then ant said, don't worry about
my size but look at my confidence.
What's your confidence?
Ant said, I can enter your nose and bite,
can you enter my nose and bite me?
Very nice one.
I've so many jokes like this.
Will you forward it to me?
I gave him my number.
Janu, look at him! Isn't he cute?
Good golf player.
- Golf player?
Are you a golf player?
I don't think we can find her.
No?
How long can we search for her?
- Till we find her.
Why are you worried man?
Rajesh has sent a message.
- What?
It seems he's waiting eagerly
for Sunday to meet me.
Send him a reply, say same here too.
Mahesh too has sent a message.
- Your romantic life has started.
You're hitting big time,
fix one of the three.
Who is best among the three?
- Rajesh!
Rajesh is good.
- How about Santhosh?
Santhosh is also good.
- Isn't Mahesh cute?
Mahesh is also good.
By any chance,
you want all the three?
What shall we do now?
I can't.
- Come.
Why are you saying bore?
Just thoughts about meeting her,
where and how is mind blowing...
Missed your purse?
Want us to pay the bill?
It's not a bill problem,
but heart problem.
Will you please pick a chit from these?
- What's this?
Tell him to pick it up quickly.
Please pick on quickly.
Will you offer a coconut to God without
making wish, will it be fulfilled?
If you tell me what's in
those chits, I'll pick one.
You're unable to get me,
she's my friend Janu,
she dated three boys.
Three boys?
All three responded positively.
It's all over, this will not work out,
let's go boys...come...
Stop...stop...
what's the problem in it?
Problem is all three boys
are damn good,
she's confused which
one of them to select.
Pick up a chit, her life will be settled.
What should I do now?
I must pick up one chit from it, right?
Your friend's life is settled.
Yes indeed.
I'm also joining this game.
You'll get a great lover.
It won't be nice if I write my name
and pick it myself.
Come and pick one.
Come, let's go.
Open is leisurely and
see who's the lucky boy.
Till then my love is all yours.
Is it enough if you look
at me like that?
My eyes must always
keep watching you only...
You've created a lovely
commotion in me...
My heart is surfing in the sea...
Sydney has done injustice to me by
hiding you away from me till now...
It realised the mistake, felt shy
and shown you to me today...
Like day breaks on a sea shore...
It's fresh and exhilarating...
I'm very happy this moment...
I'm hit by the Tsunami of happiness...
I know very little about you...
Yet I like you so much...
An urge to meet you...
spilled out like a lava from a volcano...
The pain of past eased
on seeing you today...
Her innocent mischief pulled me
closer to her...
I started floating in air
leaving the ground..
I've changed the 7 colours of rainbow
into fresh love orange...
Like a new born baby...
You've blossomed freshly...
In the air I breath now...
you've turned it cool...
A new magic has took over me
after seeing you today...
How long I've been calling you, Ram?
Why don't you answer me?
What are you thinking?
About a girl.
First time I've met
a mischievous girl in Sydney.
Do you know how much I like her?
Don't discuss about this
nonsense with me.
I hate it.
He'll never change.
How many times I've told him not to
smoke and that too before me?
Why don't you ask him?
Can I ask him?
- Chain smoker.
He wanted to be a pilot,
but ended up doing sky diving.
It seems that's real flying.
Then he wanted to be a photographer,
but ended up as wildlife photographer.
If I ask, he'll say forest never lies.
Then, he wanted to be a painter,
but he's a graffiti artiste now.
He says that real painting.
I don't know what's that reality
which I don't know.
You know everything,
what's there to ask him now.
Where are you going?
- To get paper
Why don't you tell her the truth that
you're going to smoke, brother-in-law?
What? Smoke?
He quit smoking long time ago.
Have you started it again?
- He never quit smoking.
Never quit smoking?
He'll say like that only,
you go inside, mind your work.
So you down to get paper every day...
- Why are you fixing me?
You may ruin my home.
Why do you want to stay in
a ruining home, brother-in-law?
Brother-in-law always wishes well
for brother-in-law, take it.
Thanks for the wishes, you said
about falling in love with a girl.
Go after her first, leave me alone.
Where are you going?
- To smoke...
Where are you guys?
Come quickly.
We've urgent work.
What do you want me to do?
What else do you want me to do?
Always this fuss in this morning.
I did really had a business
meeting yesterday.
I'm not lying.
The mistake is mine not yours.
I thought you'll understand me but
didn't expect you'll kill me with fuss.
You mean...will you kill me?
Kill me...kill me I say...
I'm coming.
Why are you still hesitating?
Open it.
Okay, let's decide to open it or not,
make your choice.
Open it...open it...
He's here again.
Did you see? Is it my name?
I thought my love story didn't have
a villain, but here he comes.
Hi my love!
Is it my name in the chit?
You're scared!
- Why should I be scared?
You're scared that the chit
may have my name.
I'm not scared.
If it's my name in the chit,
will you love me?
What if it has any of their names?
You're scared!
What man?
I saw the chit, it wasn't your name.
Will you please leave me alone?
It's like a pet's name.
I'm like a pet to Janu.
Stop.
Love?
Will you please leave me, Puppy?
Will you trap her?
- I'll try.
Daddy trusts you and Puppy
to conduct this program well,
Ensure strangers don't barge in.
What happened?
- What happened?
What happened to her?
This is my parents' wedding anniversary,
so please don't disturb me.
Your parents?
I'll wish them.
Wait.
You are..?
- I'm Ram.
My friend Ram.
Was yours love marriage or
arranged marriage, uncle?
Infact after hearing their love story
I got this passion,
sir, please tell him that first episode.
Why now, Puppy?
- Please tell him, madam.
Puppy is asking, right?
Go ahead sir.
I went to their home to meet
her as bride.
On seeing that smile,
I lost my heart to her.
They took her inside,
I went after her citing some reason.
She was with her friends,
and smiling at me.
Then I observed,
I was in their kitchen.
I wrote I love you on paper chit
as she watched,
and put it into the rice box,
and observed it from a distance,
I was shocked.
- Why uncle?
Because before she could take it,
her mother took it first.
What happened then?
We got married, 25 years passed.
Uncle, your love story beginning
was great.
How did you express your love today?
What's your problem?
I told you the chit didn't have your name.
Look, whether the chit had
my name or not,
I'm fixed, it's you, till then...
What a gutsy man!
Guts? My foot!
I don't know what you've seen in him,
tomorrow I'll show him my guts.
I'll show him.
I'll show him my guts.
What brings you here?
- She has come to warn you.
You can warn me while leaving,
come and see.
My new painting,
I painted it today, how is it?
Good but your style is not good.
Why? What happened?
- Why are you after me?
To love you.
He has a point.
What's this Puppy?
What do I know about him to love?
What do you want to know about me?
Can you play golf?
- Golf?
I hate test matches.
Can you tell jokes about lions?
Jokes on lion?
No cheeks too,
you too join the crowd,.
what do I know about you
to fall in love?
I know graffiti.
Is it graffiti greatness?
It's not crime to draw motifs
or designs in India.
But police will arrest in Australia
You know graffiti is serious crime here?
- Crime?
Where's he? Police is here.
Let's run, really, its crime!
You're responsible for this.
Why did you save me?
Forget about golf or telling jokes,
do you know to fight?
Fight? Me?
By the way, do you know to fight?
Do I know to fight?
Do you know to fight?
How nicely you fight!
If you thank me,
I'll drop you here only.
Then?
- You must come out with me tomorrow.
Are you going out with him?
You said he's a villain.
Is he a villain?
He's a hero who appears like villain.
What about Santhosh,
Rajesh, and Mahesh?
Can they fight?
No make up too. You know that?
Where are you taking me, Ram?
Tender love story.
Come...come...let's go.
- Stop Janu.
If you stare at me, I'll go then.
What are you doing here, Puppy?
Get down.
Playing fun? I'll not get down.
What?
I'm my parents lone child, leave me.
Lion is not a joke, see it in real.
See, don't be afraid.
I saw.
Afraid? Not me...
- Like this.
Hereafter no more lion jokes,
just mouse jokes are enough.
She's just a girl, she cracked joke on lion,
will you take her to real lion?
If I say I want to see death,
will you kill me?
I saw death.
I saw lion.
I saw a real lion, Puppy.
To hell with your lion,
I'm dying here.
I saw a real lion!
Here...so near!
Looking straight into it's eyes,
you know that?
Was it me?
I saw a lion!
Really!
Ram showed it to me.
I saw a lion!
I've decided I've fallen first
and I'll say I love you first.
I've never experienced such day
in my life, you know that?
Okay.
Really!
Okay, please don't touch camera.
Whether the chit has your name or not,
I like you very much.
I've told him.
Oh my God!
I want such love all through my life.
I want such love all my life
notjust for a day.
Tell me...tell me...
Tell me.
Tell me.
Tell me, will you?
I can't love you all my life.
True.
I can't love you all my life.
- Then?
I can love you for sometime only.
Wait a minute,
what the hell you're saying?
Will you love for sometime only?
I thought the girl is problem
in this story,
you're the actual problem.
Do you know what sort of a man he is?
There's lot more, do you know
what does he thinks of himself?
Yes, am I so cheap?
That's what I think of myself.
Enough?
He loves for sometime only but
claims to be world's greatest lover?
After knowing he's so crazy,
nobody can save him from me.
Tell me your great love story.
Let me see it.
After that incident, my friends scolded me.
For telling her the truth.
The girl who was going wild on seeing a lion,
you made her fear on seeing you.
How can she love you?
I'm sure she'll not love me.
Then what? If anyone asks
will you love me?
You must say I'll love for
any number of births.
Only then they'll fall in love.
It must be my mad girl,
watch how I'll manage her.
Just reached office,
where are you now?
I'm in Victoria hospital to
donate blood to a little girl.
Do you know the girl's name?
- What?
Removing the needle,
I'm tired, I'll call later.
Love means few lies, few SMS's,
cruel jokes, and a flower.
I can't love like that.
- Then?
I'll love telling the truth.
All having good time,
why did I get hooked to such a guy?
I've sent so many messages
to you, not a single reply.
I'm little tensed.
New lion joke, may I tell now?
Later...
He's announcing it to every one.
Who is he?
Who the hell are you?
How come you're here, Ram?
Do you remember us?
I'm Geetu, she is...
Who are you searching?
- Janu came here, right?
Where is she? Did you see her?
I saw her. She must be
somewhere here only.
She came here just now, right?
Where did she go away?
Oh God!
I was searching for you only.
- Were you searching for me?
What's up? It seems you
showed her real lion.
Wild love?
- Too much.
You keep quiet, you tell us, Ram.
Who proposed first? You or she?
Don't tell...
- She proposed to me first.
He revealed it.
Didn't I tell you that she would
be the first to propose?
I knew it, what was your reply?
What would he say? I must live
rest of my life with you, right?
Actually, I told...
What? Didn't tell anything?
Shall we go out?
Better to stay away from them.
- Advice?
How is it?
Very good.
Do you like graffiti?
Like? I love graffiti.
What are you thinking?
- My future man.
How many days you spent drawing
this and how many litres of paint?
How high it was painted? Was it drawn
by one or many painters?
Do you feel like that on seeing yourself?
Do you know how I feel?
After long time,
I've drawn a human face.
Don't you like human faces?
It lacks truth in it.
Right?
Then why did you like my face?
When I saw you for the first time,
the happiness in your eyes,
that innocence, that freshness,
It was true!
- Tension too.
You like to love and I love to love.
Those who watch are dead.
- That's why I like you.
But you said you'll love
for sometime only, right?
Yes.
After that?
I'll feel like breaking off.
If you feel like that?
- Let's break up.
Let's love happily till we break up.
- Did you find me for this game?
Are you sure we'll break up?
- Won't you believe me? Come.
Don't know what he'll show me next?
How dare to bring
your girl friend to me?
She doesn't believe me when I said
I'll love for sometime only.
I thought you'll tell her,
so I brought her here.
Would anyone bring like this?
- I've brought, right?
What sort of love is yours?
It need to be displayed
in this museum.
Do you love him?
You will fall in love with him.
He'll not leave you without
making you do it,
you too can't get rid of him.
That's the way he loves.
It'll be so good that you don't like
anyone's love other than him.
Even after he's gone, you can't
compare anyone with him.
He'll cite some reason
and break away harshly.
Janu, I'm jealous of you.
Because you've got his love.
I pity you too.
Because you'll end up
like me some day.
If you come here again, I'll kill you.
What are you thinking?
Why did you split with her?
Because I was in love with her
for quite long time.
Would anyone split for long time love?
Still can't believe it?
Come, I haven't split with any girl
without a valid reason.
Check.
- Girls mean?
The girls I loved.
Right from Meenakshi teacher
as a kid to recent lover Madhu.
Is your number 1 0?
Slowly...
- Is your number 1 0?
I thought I got myself a Ram but
got hooked to a Krishna, Puppy.
Watch this cinema first,
later on that cinema.
Did you do anything like this?
But I'm still a virgin.
You look ultra modern but
think like a mass hero.
Why did you love so many girls?
Because I can't live without love.
Isn't there any one as best
in your long list of lovers?
Why not?
Who is it?
- Me!
I'm the best in my love stories.
Why did you split up with
the sixth girl?
She wanted me to tell
I love you every day.
That's why I broke up with her.
For I love you!
Oh God! I asked for lover not a problem.
I couldn't sleep last night.
- Why?
Would anyone split with lover
for asking to tell I love you?
She wanted to live all life
with just I love you.
Isn't that the meaning of I love you?
We can't impound a life time's love
in just three words of I love you.
That's why I don't believe
the words I love you.
Where the hell did you find him, Janu?
What's this silly game?
- Silly.
What are you thinking?
That's me.
Shall we love?
Though we are two separate identities...
But today I feel I'm in you,
strangely...
So much that I'm searching
for myself...
Don't know what will happen
to me without you...
I want your friendship...
I swear...
I'll do anything to make
you believe me...
Once I fall for any girl,
no lass would dare lose me...
I love very sincerely...
Once you drown in my love,
it isn't so easy to come out of it...
You'll give your life also...
I'm honest...
I'll tell truth only...
I hate lies and liars...
I'm the lone good man...
I'm mad about romance...
Don't ponder, say yes to me...
O girl, my heart never wears
any mask...
I'll show my trueself...
If you no, my love will not give up,
it'll fight to win...
O maiden! Always ready to fight me...
You're my world today, my dear...
Even if you search all planets...
Though heaven comes down on earth...
You can't find a man like me
anywhere...
Even great Taj Mahal is just
a poor hut compared to me...
Hereafter my name will top the
greatest lovers of this world...
I got hooked to trouble unnecessarily
saying I love you to him.
You're the villain to yourself.
How can she love you after
hearing the truth from you?
Buddy, if you want girls
to love you,
few lies, SMS's, cruel jokes,
and a flower. That's it.
Drinking so early morning?
- Hang over peg, buddy.
Bloody...
- He too got angry.
Won't she get angry if I drink?
And for that we can't tell the truth also.
So, mixing this truth with false,
I'm drinking it,
I'm happy and she too is happy.
I can't tell lies like you.
- Do you mean to say mine is not love?
He's drinking thinking about you.
Yes, I'm drinking.
Mixing it with this. Taste it.
Forget it, don't I know about you?
I warned you to stay away from him.
Did you listen to me?
I should've listened to you.
You're right.
First time in my life,
I'm hating a love story.
Why are you so tensed?
He's different, Puppy.
If you're clear about it,
then it's not a problem.
How is it?
When you hate him so much,
he can't flatter you.
You'll not fall for him anyway.
He'll not say I love you to you.
You too can't say I love you to him.
He's very dangerous, Puppy.
For safer side, I'll stay in home.
Home is also not safer for you.
You're finished, trust me.
Whom do you want to meet?
Is Janu in home?
Why is he saying like that?
- He's like that only.
He tells only truth nothing but truth.
Is anybody here?
Looks like he'll call everyone
and create a scene here.
Do something.
- What do you want me to do?
How many love stories you'd seen?
Handle the situation.
Situation is routine but
the character is new.
Nobody is happy here,
what brings you here?
To meet Janu.
Are you here to meet Janu
or take her life?
Is it lover boy Puppy
speaking so harshly?
But I don't like your love story.
You know how a love story must be?
- Where to?
Love story must be like this.
Stories okay, is there love in it?
You'll lose your eyes.
This family is a big love tree.
Are you trying to uproot it?
You're a big sinner.
Who is it?
You are...?
I'm Janu's...
Daddy, he was in your
wedding anniversary too.
Actually, you stopped your
love story midway.
Puppy is continuing the remaining part.
Have you started narrating history
on a guest's arrival like him?
I'm just showing him.
Your smile is very beautiful.
Here!
Infact she trapped me with
that smile only.
Will you tell the same thing now also?
I'm telling the truth.
That story is a cherished memory.
Yours is just one story,
it's ten stories here.- What?
Nothing dad, Puppy is reminding Ram
about an urgent appointment.
Isn't it Puppy?
- Yes, I'm reminding him.
Come home when you're free.
He's inviting me again.
- Come out.
Why are you here?
I called you to say good morning,
you didn't pick it up, so here I am.
Shall we talk tonight?
- Where?
Why are you giving him time?
Why did you come so late, sir?
I've been waiting for 2 hours now.
You're here to meet your lover,
I thought you'll come little early.
What's this trouble?
- I'll show it.
Come here please.
My Janu!
My lover sir,
I love her for 1 2 years now.
The pencil she used in her class one,
syringe used on her by doctor,
hand chain...
- Enough of it.
Does she know all this?
She doesn't know it.
- Why?
If I tell her and if she says no,
I won't have anything to say.
What do you want me to do now?
You must support me,
I'm senior, right?
You want me to tell her
about this, right?
You must give her up.
Stamped your feet?
- He stamped on my heart.
Stamped heart?
Why did you throw it into this?
- Isn't that a dust bin?
It's not a dust bin,
they're my memories.
Memories?
Who is he?
It seems he's Janu's lover.
He loves her for 1 2 long years.
He's senior so wants me to give up.
- 1 2 years?
Hello 1 2 year old lover!
You're a senior citizen in love.
How can you compare
yourself with my friend?
My friend's love will last for few days
or at the most couple of months.
But for years like you...
Really?
His patience is too short.
- Unnecessarily I got worried.
You're not my competitor at all.
You can't even come near me.
Keep the box safely.
Bloody...
- Am I not right?
He's a good collection king.
It's already 1 0, not yet come.
I had promised to meet Maya at 8 am.
I got delayed because of a bullock
got killed in an accident.
I'm on the way, I'll be there
in 5 minutes. Come on.
Bullock in Sydney, you're making
Australia into Anakapalle.
Stop man.
Can't you avoid it?
- Can't avoid it, uncle.
Where did you find him?
He's pulling you out to love.
Will you go like this?
- Do I need to change?
You called me and not here.
You promised to come
and didn't turn up.
I'm here.
- What's the time now?
Can't you atleast make it on time?
I called you on phone,
you didn't answer my call.
I sent you message,
you didn't bother to read it.
Couldn't you atleast feel like
calling me to say sorry?
Did you think, he's useless guy
and will wait for me?
Give me one reason for
not making it on right time.
What do you want me to do?
Come to my home.
- To your home?
Don't worry, my sister and
brother-in-law are in home.
I know about your family,
don't you want to know about my family?
What would I do knowing about them?
Would I live with you?
Are you talking to yourself again?
- No.
Are you coming now?
- I'll come.
At what time?
If I complain about him with his sister
and brother-in-law, he'll reform.
Good, you're on time.
Where are you sister
and brother-in-law?
They've gone out.
Come here.
Are you here for me or for them?
- For you only.
What's this nasty dress?
- What's wrong with it?
Will you come dressed like this for me?
What's wrong with it?
Don't move...
- What's that?
Good, don't you know to look
colourful while meeting boy friend?
Can I ask you a question?
What's the longest period you
were in love with a girl?
What about the shortest period?
Why are you asking me the details?
To know when will you leave me.
Oh mad Janu! I'm thinking of
ways to love you,
why are you thinking
about splitting up?
First love me, we'll not split
without reasons, right?
Can't you dress like this?
- How beautiful you're now!
Hi sister!
My sister and brother-in-law.
Nothing happened here...
nothing...
Sister...
Since when and how long?
- Keep quiet.
Get me a good coffee please.
I'll give.
Why is it happening to me only?
Take it.
Have it.
Let me see if he tells the truth now.
What's it?
He needs a cigarette along with coffee.
I don't want.
- Why?
I said no, take it away.
Why are you waiting?
Waiting? No use in giving up coffee.
Quit what you ought to.
What should I quit?
- Don't you know it?
You mean to say I'm not drinking
coffee because of cigarette.
Though you're not open,
I know what's in your heart.
What do you know?
You don't know anything.
Nonsense?
- Yes.
Am I nonsense?
- Then what?
You're talking too much.
- You're arguing too much.
They're having a fight.
Stop them.
I'll tell them.
Me?
- Yes.
Best lawyer in Sydney.
He can get divorce to Rama
and Seetha also.
I think it's better for you both
to meet him and take divorce.
Brother-in-law always wishes
good for brother-in-law.
Yes, he's not a brother who advises
brother-in-law to divorce sister.
Bloody divorce!
Giving me a lawyer's card.
Why are you advising your
sister to take divorce?
Don't you like that idea?
Do you know why they're still together?
They don't know to part ways.
You're lucky in this matter.
You've got a man who knows
when to break off.
It's bad luck not luck!
Why are you getting ready
with so heavy make up?
For him only, Puppy.
- For him?
It seems he loves me like this only.
If not he's getting me ready.
As bonus giving me a lecture too.
I'm ready.
What happened?
He has given me a holiday today.
- Holiday?
Holiday in love?
Useless lover!
Did you ever excite me like this?
Waste fellow!
Your boy friend expresses his love
in a fresh and unique way every day.
What great ideas!
His ideas are good but
his ideology is very bad.
What happened?
How will it be if any man
holds you like this?
It'll be great!
Just like this he took me to moon
and dropped me down from there.
Dropped you?
You called him a hero, right?
He's not a hero, he's a villain
who appears like hero.
The first birthday after
we've fallen in love.
Let's rock tomorrow to make it most
memorable birthday of your life.
What happened?
- It's my birthday today.
I would've wished after
waking up anyway,
why did you wake me up for wishes?
He waked me up with birthday wishes.
- Did he?
He will wish!
He said let's rock tomorrow.
Anyway he'll break off by next birthday,
is he mad to rock this birthday?
Why has my love story
flopped miserably like this?
Why won't it flop?
We can't hear what he says,
we can't see what he shows,
we can't bear what he does,
totally nobody can love like him.
He's like a cyclone.
I don't know what's he up to for
tomorrow, I'm scared, Puppy.
No need to fear when I'm with you.
I've a brilliant idea to save you.
I think you'll spoil the show
by over acting.
Give me your phone.
He's coming here.
He didn't recognise us!
We can't recognise ourselves
in this get up.
How can he?
- Right?
How's my idea?
- Brilliant!
Situation is under your control, right?
- Totally under my control.
Though I was right before him,
he couldn't recognise me.
I'll go before him second time.
This is what you call rat dancing
after blinding the cat.
The lucky man amongst us
must be decided today.
Is this all for Janu's birthday?
Useless man! Did you ever do
anything like this for me?
It seems it's all for me.
Janu, come.
Look there!
What?.. Are you here for Janu?
- Yes.
Are you here to wish for her birthday?
How do you know?
- We know a lot more.
We thought we entered your love story.
Butjust came to know you'd
trespassed into our love story.
Was it your names in those chits?
You've opened a gift shop?
Everything for Janu?
Don't act smart,
we've come to a decision.
Today is Janu's birthday, one amongst
us would propose to her.
Janu was playing game for us
and you barged into the arena.
Now we'll play the game for Janu,
you pick up the lucky chit.
Playing chit game with chits.
It's new! Let's play.
He's selecting one of three himself,
let's go.
Take it now.
You've decided to play the game,
how can you play without my name?
What is he doing?
It's not fair to write my name and
pick up the lucky one, so...
Here's his nasty idea.
Why is he calling them?
Could you pick up three chits?
Why is he asking to pick three?
It must be one, right?
Why three?
After picking the three, name in the
remaining chit is Janu's lover.
See it yourself!
Second round?
What's going on there?
No, I don't want to do this.
You're seeing life from one angle only,
I'll show you from another angle.
Look down!
Life is just for once!
Why do you spend it in fear?
Think over it!
I'm also thinking about that only.
I've only one life,
why should I sacrifice it for you?
How's my surprize?
How is it?
Has love on you came after
you said yes, O my love?
If you say no now,
it won't die down, O my dear...
How your image got into
my eyes like a dream?
I'll not keep quiet till
I see you in reality...
This is my heart...
that's my love...
The wetness in my heart is engulfing
you like a tidal wave...
24 carat lovely love...
I'm showering it on you 24x7...
Though you scold or chide me...
I'm dying for you every
moment of my life...
Like the colourful rainbow
vanishes easily...
My heart is pure white
which will never vanish...
It's been waiting for you since eons
and blooming for you only......
It says it loves you...
What would you lose
if you say yes to it?
I'm having a beautiful dream...
I'm with you in it...
Eternal bliss...
I'm saying it's all yours...
It's a feeling only a heart can feel...
Read it with your heart if you want to...
My love is perennial like river Ganges...
It's a lively rhythm of life...
Impound it in your heart...
With your every rejection
my love for you is increasing...
I'm scared I may see life
from another angle, Puppy.
I heard so many love stories and
I could understand them easily,
but I can't understand
your love story.
Would I fall for him
if I continue like this?
If you get this doubt,
I'm sure you will fall.
There's only one man who can
save you from this situation.
Who is it?
- Your daddy.
My daddy?
What do you think of yourself?
Is that the gift you give
her on birthday?
Yes I did.
It all happened because of you.
- What happened?
I had to sacrifice my 1 2 year old love.
- Sacrificed your 1 2 year old love?
For whom?
For Janu!
- For Janu?
Janu's marriage has been fixed.
Tomorrow is the engagement.
Is Janu getting married?
It all happened because of you.
You say love and she's ready
to marry another man.
Leave her.
Do you want me also to sacrifice?
I can't believe you're getting
engaged so suddenly.
Your dad saved the day for you.
I've seen the groom, he's dashing.
Yes, your romantic life
will start now, Janu.
Your friends?
- Yes brother.
Why did you come here?
- I need to talk to Janu.
Impossible.
She's getting engaged.
- Why so suddenly?
Did you fix this engagement
getting scared of me?
Why would we be scared of you?
I can see it, you're scared
Janu may fall in love with me.
That's your imagination.
I'll talk to Janu for a couple of minutes.
Love is life time bond in my family.
Though you don't about that,
Janu knows it very well.
Notjust couple of minutes,
talk to her for hours.
Nothing will change, call Janu.
So, you're getting married.
Have you accepted this
proposal for your father?
Marrying getting scared of me?
No.
- Then? Who decided this for you?
Myself.
Can you decide also?
How did you decide?
Using chits?
Who is the groom?
Handsome.
Marry him, I'll not stop you.
But answer all my questions
and then marry him.
Why are you marrying him now?
How did you decide on him?
What's the guaranty that
he'll love all your life?
Answer me.
I don't need to answer you.
I'm not asking you to tell me.
I'm asking if you've answers
for these questions.
If you've, Ram will not
be in Janu's life.
If you don't, nobody can take
me away from your life.
Go, call for you.
Poor man would've sacrificed
love like me.
Sacrifice? That too him?
I don't think you've understood
about him.
Don't ever try to know about him.
You'll not be there for you also.
No need of hours,
just 2 minutes were enough.
You carry on.
Go uncle, auspicious time
is elapsing. Go...go...
Why are you marrying him now?
How did you decide on him?
What's the guaranty that
he'll love all your life?
I'm asking if you've answers
for these questions.
I don't want this marriage, daddy.
Till now you ditched lovers, have you
started ruining their marriages too?
You'll not love her or
allow her to marry in life.
Are you a human?
Janu has taken a good decision
for the first time in life.
Let's encourage her.
- For that?
Let's go to her home.
- No way!
Stop...stop...
Please leave us...
What's he man?
How are you?
Your face is clear.
Who is it, dear?
Shekhar, come quickly.
I'm here to talk to Janu
for two minutes.
You ruined her marriage and
dared to come to my home.
Why are you talking to him, brother?
Hey, get out!
Go!
Uncle, cool...uncle.
I didn't break the engagement, uncle.
Your daughter.
I know who is responsible for
breaking the engagement.
You get out.
I'll talk to him, daddy.
Leave it on me.
I broke the engagement,
it doesn't mean I love you,
yes, I was playing game with chits,
I must thank you for one thing,
because I didn't knew till then who I want
and what sort of a man I want,
I've come to know of it
because of you,
I want a man who loves me
all my life,
and I'm sure it's not you.
All three of us like you,
you've to select one of us.
I'll tell my decision
before Valentine's day.
Are you busy?
I'll wait here.
Neither he loves nor
allows us to love.
He's like that only.
We'll take care of him.
Why are you disturbing her?
I love her.
You love her?
Janu must also love you, right?
Anyway Janu has struck your
name from the game,
but still what makes you
so confident?
If you're confident she'll
love you, won't I've it?
But she has told us about taking
a decision on Valentine's Day.
Do you need to take such decisons?
My life and I'll take decisions.
Everything is okay,
but you wanted some one
who loves you all your life,
that's...how will you decide it?
How will you find it?
Finding a man like is difficult,
but finding a sincere lover is easy.
I can find him.
- Difficult.
I can find.
- I said it's difficult.
I know what I want, I can find him.
Who is he?
Where is he?
Okay, it's not me.
Is it any one of those three?
How about that pink shirt guy?
Is it that blue shirt guy?
That white shirt guy?
That red shirt guy with cap?
Who? Is it him...this guy?
Who is it?
If you've so many choices in campus,
think of choices in this city,
country and this world.
how many choices you've, Janu?
How will you find the right man
for you among those billions?
One man...can't you find
one man from so many?
I must find him.
If not I've to accept what he said.
What was she and
what you've made her.
Never give an opportunity
for girls to think.
See what has happened.
I'm sure she would've deleted
your name from her phone.
You too delete her name.
Who are you calling?
- Janu.
What's your confidence?
He has started it again.
Don't you've any other work?
If outgoing call is free,
try another number.
She has told you about her decision
clearly, can't you hear it?
Didn't get it?
I understood her well but
what she said was meaningless.
Tell her, it was a stupid decision.
What did he say, Puppy?
- It seems your decision is stupid.
Will it become stupid if he says so?
- He never lies.
What do you think of yourself?
Am I stupid? Is my decision foolish?
- Any doubt?
Am I stupid if I reject you?
Forget about accepting
or rejecting me,
you said you wanted a man who
will love you all your life, right?
Yes.
- That's why I said stupid.
I've taken a strong decision.
That's why I said stupid.
Remember one thing, there's no man
who will love all the life.
That's how a man who doesn't have
trust on love would feel.
I trust love more than you, Janu.
Listen to me, love is good
for sometime only.
You'll be confused first
and later would be clear.
Till then, my love is yours.
Till now he said he would love
for sometime only,
is he saying love is good
for sometime only?
Does he think he's Einstein of love?
Mad man...mad man...
Is 1 2 year a short period?
It seems a jaundiced man
sees everything yellow.
That's the way he behaves.
Did he ask you all this?
Don't we still love each other?
Love is wonder!
Love must be eternal, right?
He's trying to confuse
you unnecessarily.
We made a big mistake of
leaving him initially, brother.
We mustn't spare him.
I think this game was found for you only.
To play without moving much.
Didn't expect me here, right?
You're very lucky,
that's why you're here now.
I'm not one to fear
for a scare, uncle.
In golf, you hit the ball from behind,
in cricket, I love hitting the ball
coming on to me.
What ever it is, face to face.
I love Janu very much.
Love her so much.
If you hit 25 runs, your daughter
wants to hit a century,
that's where a small fight
is on between us,
when I say love's life is very short,
let's love for sometime only,
she's confused,
I'm just making some headway
in moving her, uncle,
once she's clear,
I'm sure she'll love me.
What do you say, uncle?
Anyway isn't it too early for fights?
After Janu starts loving me,
let's sit and talk leisurely. Bye.
That's why I hate dads and uncles.
I'm an enigma to them.
They need a lot of time
to understand me.
I'm not a playboy, I honestly
and truely love Janu.
To tell you clearly...
Very difficult with you.
Why aren't you calling her even once?
What if she selects anyone else?
What wil be your position?
She must do it only then
he'll get some sense.
Do you think will there be
anyone like that?
That's why I warn you not to
call me when he's here.
I'm going.
- Maya, sit down.
Even if there's one,
he'll be one in millions,
I didn't see one, have you seen
anyone like that, Maya?
If Janu finds anyone like that,
she'll bring him to me.
Don't disturb me on phone.
Blabber what ever you feel like,
but don't ever bother about me.
Janu is here.
She appears happy.
Has she found anyone?
I'll be happy if she finds anyone.
Come.
Have you found your dream man?
You're confident that I'll fail
to find a man, right?
I'm not here to tell you that
I didn't find such a man,
I'm here to tell you that these
so much love that I can't find,
everyone loves other wonderfully,
I'll find the man I want among them.
When? Before Valentine's day?
There's no time limit for it,
my life, I'll decide when I want to.
I'm damn sure you'll not
find such a man.
You've nine love failures behind
you to think like that.
But I've many successful stories
to say confidently I can find.
All are really love failure stories.
- Are they failures?
What are you saying?
Do you know who much my parents
love each other even today?
My uncle, aunt, my friend Sony
have said they're happy in love.
They are lying.
Lie?
Is love a lie?
Is my love a lie?
- How dare he says our love is lie?
That's why I hate him.
- He's crack, don't worry about him.
How dare!
My brother was right.
You still smoke cigarettes, right?
He's not just a villain to you
but villain to all of us.
Why are you here with a gang?
It seems you said our love is fake.
I didn't mean you, I said it generally.
Aren't we part of it?
We've only one love, how can we
accept if you say it's fake?
We're here to settle it.
Let's settle it, nothing to worry.
Give the bottle.
Let's play a game.
When the bottle stops, one facing the
bottle top must select truth or dare.
It means truth or dare!
Truth means you can ask me anything
or I can ask you anything.
But you must tell only truth.
Truth means only truth?
- Can't avoid it.
One who can't can select dare.
It means do anything what others ask.
We've the dare to face the truth.
- Truth is like lion.
Getting into forest to see it or
playing this game is same.
It stopped towards me.
It seems you said love is good
for sometime only.
That's true.
Love will be very good initially,
later it becomes journey in traffic,
won't you believe it?
Ask Sathya!
Maya, no need to play these
lousy games, let's go.
Your turn now.
If two beautiful girls come to you now,
one girls says she wants love,
another girl wants sex,
what would you select?
What would you do with her then?
What if you're asked the
same question?
I'll say I'm already in love.
What lousy answer, you waste fellow.
I said love, right?
All three of you love Janu.
If Janu selects anyone on you three,
who will sacrifice for her?
All three! It means you'll give up Janu.
Why do you love him?
How do you know it?
He told me while proposing.
Will you love anyone who
promises you that?
Has anyone ever told lies in love?
Why are you asking the question
before spinning the bottle?
This question for the person
who faces this bottle.
I'm asking you again.
Has anyone ever told lies in love?
Me again!
No pass or fail, face it.
Quit? So it means you've lied to me.
I've told you little lies
to keep you happy.
Will you lie to keep me happy?
So you were lying to me
all these days.
Have you ever told your lover
he or she is dirty?
Those who were talking hours on phone
feel like cutting the call now.
What do boys think about
girls when they're alone?
I'm telling you love is true
but only for short period.
What would you say?
Does anyone here want
to break up the relationship?
This game is very ricky,
let's stop it.
Loving 9 girls isn't great,
you got rid of 9 girls,
that's really great.
Tell me one good idea to
get rid of my girl friend.
Tell her the truth.
- That's very difficult.
What's your girl friend's name?
He's asking me an idea
to get rid of you.
The speed with which she's coming
it's one day trouble only, hold on.
From tomorrow it's happy
all the way. Go.
Come...waste fellow...
were you with me under duress?
Shall we play a game?
My love is of high range...
It has never tasted defeat...
It goes on saying truth or
dare at times...
This is force of heart...
it's a honey bee that drinks love...
That's why all want my heart...
Love which is growing tall
like Mt.Everest...
One must be daring to reach
the pinnacle...
For love that's like McKenna's gold...
one must comb the desert...
Love isn't seen in the
sweet nothings...
Hearts that hide truth
can never love...
I'll fall in love thousand times...
I've so many feelings...
I'll write new history...
there's life in my love...
I'll make my dreams come true....
I dare to speak truth only...
If you look into my heart,
I've courage to give you shivers...
O my love...don't leave me...
Come to my way...
Don't fall for youth that cheats
showing you day dreams...
Desire for the heart that
truely loves you...
If love showers dew,
don't kill it with your fire of hatred...
If love wants to shake hands with you,
don't break the back of it...
If love presents you nectar,
don't add to with poison...
If love is a beautiful song,
don't gag it's voice...
Say yes to love...
You take chances...
All lovers together can't take on me...
There's no guaranty with promise
of love for each other all the life...
We came here bunking college,
why are you troubling here also?
Don't get upset with these liars.
- I'm not upset.
Look, how people love each other.
They are marrying happily.
Look at Sony.
I still have hope.
They're in love for 1 00 days now.
We came to wish them.
There's nothing as you say.
Then, you must wish me also.
- Why?
My love is also 1 00 days old.
- What?
Yes, I saw you the day
he proposed to her.
I didn't see you after that.
I searched entire Sydney.
I met you again while playing
that chit game.
You shouldn't have seen me at all.
I heard a lot about you.
It seems you'll say only truth.
I too heard a lot about you, it seems
you'll ooze love with just SMS's
Why are you sending with him?
- Nothing will happen.
Will you always tell truth only?
When will you invite for your wedding?
Let me finish my studies.
Shall we light it?
Do we need to go
to Lanka to burn it?
Is it okay to you here?
Life must be wild but I like portraits.
He went that side and
sent a message immediately.
I sent the message to her!
What happened?
I'm dead!
No, right message but
sent to wrong person.
May be his sister.
Not his sister, looks like
she'll become my sister.
Please manage the situation.
I thought you love her,
are you managing her?
You can play with lies
but never with truths.
He's forwarding the messages
to her also.
I'll...
Ram is also there.
Go and face the truth.
Don't do it before him.
What Swapna?
Who is she?
Give me your phone.
- What happened, Sony?
Who is Swapna?
What are you talking?
Give me your phone.
Looks like a small misunderstanding.
Right, if this Miss and that Miss
have little understanding,
all three can settle down.
You too had 9 girl friends.
- I never loved two at a time.
Can't you stop their fight?
Look, people use the
moment to fall in love,
likewise there's a moment of breaking,
nobody uses it.
Tell your friend to use it.
Leave me.
Why are you pulling me?
Get lost!
I'll never see your face in my life.
Would there be such people in world?
That's true.
What's true? You say love is good
for short while only. Is it that?
You're right again. That's it.
- You're a mad man.
Girls will never trust this.
How am I to tell you?
How are we going so smoothly
in this pitch darkness?
Because of car headlights.
If we travel watching as far as
this headlight shows us,
our journey will be happy
and pleasant.
My love too is just the same.
What do you call life long love then?
I'll show you.
Why are you going so fast?
Why are you driving so fast?
My love is like trusting
my headlights,
life long love is like trusting
the other car's headlights.
Make your choice.
Why are they moon walking?
He would've shown something to them.
What happened to them?
I gave them a practical
lesson on philosophy.
Lesson on philosophy? You mean.
Difficult to tell.
I'll show you.
Show me.
- Stay away from him, please.
You'll be finished.
Why are you afraid?
He too is in the car.
Hop in.
- Nobody can reform you. Let's go.
Will you get down Puppy?
- Open the door.
I told you his philosophy
will be heavy and not light.
Didn't go to bed yet, dear?
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking about what I really want.
What do you want?
I want a love like yours, mom.
Do you and dad still love
each other, right mom?
Everyone can't tell truth like him.
It's true we loved each other once,
that doesn't mean we don't
love each other now,
he thinks he still loves.
Why are you still living together
though you know this, mom?
Love is the reason for
two hearts to live together,
later children become the reason,
don't think too much, go to sleep.
You're super boss!
I was fighting for freedom for 2 years,
I got it at last because of you.
Waste fellow!
Still have hope?
Can see it.
- Look! Is it like Valentine's day?
You've put an end card to every
love story in the campus.
Me? What did I do?
I'll put an end card to your
love story, watch it.
Let's decide it today once for all.
You said you'll decide today...
Me too!
- Janu, please say something.
I need time.
You liked me first,
what happened now?
We liked each other, right?
You said you'll decide
on Valentine's day.
Don't rush.
Is there any rule that
she must tell today only?
Once she's clear she'll tell her decision.
Don't confuse again.
She'll decide today.
You'll say you like me, right?
You promised to decide on Valentine's day...
- Say something, Janu.
Look what had happened!
You pushed her to wall,
what happened to your decision?
It all happened because of you.
You...
How do we look like to you?
- Do we look like mad people?
What do you think of yourself?
Do I look like a joker for following you?
Who gave phone number first?
You or me?
Who called first? You or me?
Tell me.
Are we so cheap for
following like dogs?
Tell me, I'm asking you.
- You put your hand on me, it's okay.
Take your hands off her.
- Should I take my hands off her?
Do you need this?
There's no one in Janu's heart,
including myself.
Look, she roams with many boys.
- he has many love stories.
He's supporting her.
Good...very good.
She doesn't know
how a lover should love her.
Wait a minute...
what's your confusion?
I don't get you, what's wrong in
what she has asked?
She asked for a life long love.
Can't you do it?
I can't.
Why?
- I can't do it.
Why I say?
Because I don't believe
in life long love.
You don't believe in it.
Tell me why you don't believe it.
How am I to tell you?
Okay. I'll tell you from here.
After finishing student exchange
program in Hyderabad,
I was leaving to Australia that day...
I saw that girl then...
Her name was Roopa!
So beautiful to pull you to her.
Her smile...her beauty...
Her innocence...
Without my knowledge
my legs followed her.
Ram, stop! We've just an hour
to submit project report.
Tell the auto to stop.
I thought you'll go home,
but you came to station.
To go home.
- Home?
Smile again?
I saw you in college.
I came there to meet my friend.
Friend? What's the name?
- Friend's name?
Who wants to know your friend's name?
What's your name?
Do you love me?
I think the symptoms are like that.
Still 30 minutes for my train to leave.
Love as much as you can
in the mean time.
Buddy! Project! Just an hour only.
I've just half an hour only.
Just half an hour only? Why?
Stop...where are you going?
Smile again.
Where's the train going to?
- Mumbai.
Mumbai?
I know it.
It stops in 30 stations in between.
What's this? You give time but
don't tell me anything.
Will you atleast tell me your name?
Same smile again.
How about cell number?
Can't you tell me something?
Just half an hour...
Can't you atleast tell me
your friend's name?
You didn't want to know little earlier.
I was little cranky then.
We're getting late.
I'm also getting late here.
We're getting late.
- Me too here.
Go away.
Train is leaving, please...
I've decided it's you.
Mumbai! City of my love, may be
that's why I liked it so much.
Why is he running without
even taking the bags?
I'm here for my love.
- Stop, salesmen are not allowed in.
Get lost man!
- Stop, you can't enter.
Why did you come here also?
Half an hour is not enough.
- I want it life long.
Isn't she your sister?
- Who are you?
Bless me please.
Hubby, some boy in our balcony...
Who are you?
- Oh my father-in-law!
Who are you?
- Your future son-in-law.
You ruined everything.
Would anyone say that so directly?
I told the truth, right?
Tie your truth in a paper and...
Come back.
Half an hour isn't enough for me too.
Your beauty is ravishing...
Oh God! You're my love...
What's this magic?
It's chasing me...
Suddenly something is
swaying me away...
I'm going mad with happiness...
Though it calls your smile as mad...
it asks how can you be with it?
My heart is pushing me to touch you...
Can't say no to her mischiefs
or do anything with me...
I'm not content with time
spent with her....
I want to be merged in
this happiness eternally...
My heart wishes it...
These moments with you
is heart stopping...
I feel like I've got wings...
My heart is soaring into sky...
Though I'm talking to you day
and night, it's not enough...
I love your smile...
I love your walking style...
My legs refuse to walk away
from you...
What ever you blabber,
I'm all ears to it...
My dreams are all about you only...
The happiness I experience
when I'm with you...
Won't it be mine forever?
Where did he go locking
the door at this hour?
Let's search down stairs. Come
- Come.
First birthday after falling in love.
I was waiting for her wishes.
I'll call you later, cut the line.
Thank you brother-in-law.
Thanks sister.
Project got over a month ago,
where are you, what are you doing?
I'm Bombay.
- What are you doing in Bombay?
I'm in love.
Cut the line.
It seems he's in love.
You know how eagerly I was waiting
for your wish since midnight?
I too was trying to call you,
you know?
Forget it.
What are you doing here?
We were waiting for your
party since last night.
Throat is dry, come on buddy.
- You start it, I'll join you.
Who wished you first on phone?
Me! So...
Stop guys!
What's this?
How come you're sticking him
to like iron to a magnet?
What?
What's the gift?
She always sends me messages.
But so late on my birthday.
What should I reply to her?
Get lost!
What's the gift?
It's so heavy.
Is it again Mallika? Did she reply?
Give me.
Sorry boy, I'll be the first to wish
on your next birthday.
I promise on you.
Did you hear that? She has sworn on me.
That she'll wish me first on my next birthday.
Get lost.
I wish Mallika was also here.
I'll go now, you finish everything.
- Why?
Let's meet later.
I saw such an expression in her
for the first time.
After that many a times.
What happened?
Always smoking cigarettes.
Doesn't she have any other work?
- Give me...she's my friend.
So what? Should she have to send
SMS hundred times every day.
It's very nice, how do you do it?
- We do it, sir.
You can shade this little darker...
- Yes sir, I can...
Keep this.
First time I felt I was being
pulled behind.
How happy I'm walking
with you like this.
But I was afraid.
I was worried about spoiling
this happiness.
First time I deleted Mallika's message.
The first thing I hid and
the first lie I ever told.
What are you doing?
I'm studying.
- Okay, study.
Tell me.
Why are you so serious?
I said it for fun, I was thinking
about you only.
If a lie can make her happy,
who wants the truth?
Little things, but was forced
to lie about it.
What's the problem?
I didn't know.
First time I felt those three words
were meaningless.
College got over so early?
Your regular order...
I'll get it.
Give me your phone.
I'll play games.
What's that girl's name?
Lilly or Malli?
Isn't she in touch with you?
Infact I don't even know where is she?
It's been many days since I met her.
How long have you been
deleting her messages?
How long have you been
checking my messages?
She is my best friend.
What's in it other than hi and hello?
- Hi boy!
Don't I know you love your friends?
- Roopa, please try to understand me.
They're good guys.
They're my childhood friends.
I don't like your friends.
Come.
He's calling us...
Why are you crying for this silly thing?
- Is lying silly thing to you?
I didn't know why I was lying to her.
I thought my love won't be like others.
I didn't expect to go like this.
How could i decide she'll be
the love of my life.
Is love wonderful?
Who said that?
That doesn't mean we weren't happy.
We were...every time we lied.
But what so ever it may, I understood
I'll try to love her sincerely.
But I don't know how long it'll last.
I've told my parents and
got their approval.
Why are you startled?
Surprized, how I got their apporval?
I told them you love me so much,
And that you'll do anything for me,
no father would say no.
He has invited you tomorrow.
How nice it would be to stay
like all our lives.
Would my entire life be
like this only?
Roopa has told me lot about you.
Have coffee.
She said you both love each other,
so we couldn't say no.
Come dear, stand near him.
Aren't a fine looking couple?
You'll be happy like all your life, right?
What should I tell now?
One more lie!
I'm asking you,
You'll be happy
like all your life, right?
I don't know.
What do you don't know?
Why did you say like that?
My father is asking if you
really love me.
What am I to tell him?
- I don't know.
Don't you know?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know how many lies I've to tell
to live happily with you all the life.
My habits, my friends, my hobbies,
I don't know what other things
I've to sacrifice.
I don't know who my life
will be in future.
Do you atleast know it?
You hold my hand and walk with me.
Do you feel anything here?
You ask me to look into your eyes,
can you see little love in it?
I'll go on repeat I love you too
entire day,
it's not coming from heart,
did I love you for this?
Did I love to live like this?
What's the problem?
- Get lost man!
Bothering me!
It's hell if two people live
together without love.
We can't stick on together.
It's worse than hell to live thinking that
this is love which is non-existent.
I can't do it.
If I don't tell you this one truth now,
I may end up acting love on you for
entire life because I loved you once.
I can't do it.
- Then, leave me alone.
Go!
I really felt free after saying go.
The longer your love,
the intensity of it decreases.
You're right.
We've one life only.
We mustn't spend it in lies.
What the hell are you saying?
I thought you'll say he wrong but
you're actually supporting him.
We're living together for 25 years,
we are very happy.
Nothing has happened as he says.
First tell him to stop talking about us.
Would anyone love such a honest man?
Ask him.
How can a girl love if you say
you'll love for sometime only?
Did we split up without she loving me?
Did she love you though knowing
you'll love for sometime only?
How is it possible?
Didn't finish it?
- I'll finish it.
Started it yesterday only.
I wanted a man who will love all my life.
But didn't know how he'll love me.
Now I know it.
I want a man who loves truely like you.
Am I hearing right?
You're not saying this for
saving you, right?
You didn't save me now.
- Then?
You saved me long back.
When I played the chit game
innocently to select boy friend,
you joined the game and saved me,
you told me the truth to love for short
time when I wanted love for all life,
and saved me again,
I agreed to marry getting
angry on you,
you made me refuse the marriage
in the last moment,
you saved me there once again,
you made me realise that as love
grows longer lies join the life,
you saved me there again,
you kept on saving me,
I didn't get it first.
I didn't do anything to save you.
I was just trying to be
truthful to my love.
I'm so happy for understanding me.
Let's forget this world and love.
Love truely.
Love so much.
You want that, right?
Yes Ram, I want this true love
all my life.
Ask me love,
I'll give as much as you want.
But don't put a condition of
period for my love.
Because love will not be
the same all the life.
Even if I say it, don't believe it.
Love is not two hearts but two brains,
both think differently,
I love cricket and you love golf,
I love graffiti, you don't like it,
what I love in you today,
I may not like it in future,
I don't want us to live a life of lies
cheating each other.
You shattered everything
in which I had faith.
Don't shatter this one too.
What do you want me to do
without shattering it?
If I say love will be same
as of today all the life,
that will be my first lie,
I had to break away from so many
because I had to lie to them,
if I've to start a new love with lie,
then I don't want such love.
Life long love is impossible.
I too wish it to happen.
I'm not ready to take chances
with false belief.
You must be ready to split
if it's not there.
I can never split with you.
Listen to me once.
Again the same problem.
What's your problem anyway?
- My problem? Love is my problem.
You loved 1 0 girls,
didn't misbehave with anyone.
Didn't lie to anyone.
Didn't cheat anyone.
I think it's you who got cheated.
Is it your problem not
to love many girls?
No.
Your real problem is not to
love one girl all your life, right?
Yes.
Then, you'll never get an answer
for it in your life.
You loved so many,
you loved them wonderfully,
what's there with you now?
Except the reasons for
breaking with them.
You've ten reasons now,
do you've atleast one love?
Don't spend life with reasons.
what's there with you now?
Except the reasons for
breaking with them.
Don't spend life with reasons.
If love is splendid initially,
it's end must be more wonderful.
If you want to see love as vast as sea,
you can see it at the fag end of life.
If you want to see it,
you need to love only one girl.
I want you.
You mean...you love me?
For short time only, right?
No.
Life long?
I don't know.
But I'll surely try to love life long.
That means you'll lie, right?
Would I lie?
- You said that.
That life long love will force you
to tell lies.
That our brains think differently.
I'm still saying, I'll never tell lies.
You want life long love, right?
I'm telling you, am I not?
- Should I love accepting it?
How to believe you?
I've crossed the stage of trusting you.
- What do you want really?
Hope.
Give me hope of life long love.
When I trust that hope I can love him.
You want me to prove now
that my love is life long.
Can anyone prove it?
- Can prove with lies?
If not no chance.
What's our friend's condition now?
It's time to start telling lies.
You look at me mischievously...
you take over me...
How am I to stop you?
You're laying a net in
the last moment...
How am I to endure with you?
O love!
It's beautiful the day it begins
like a sweet dream...
It teases you delightedly and
then turns life miserable like this...
How am I to find the way
to life long love?
How am I to convince you?
What else you want me to do?
What ever I may do is waste!
I'm asking you.
What should I do?
What? What are you looking at?
Do you want me to frame it?
Bloody spoon.
When I come to you, is it fair to
change topic and cheat me?
Why do I need love which
can't accept me for what I am....
Do one needs a partner till death?
You're teasing and handcuffing
me and my soul...
Tell me what exactly you want?
- Will you play golf?
Does it look like a ball to you?
This is my life, Puppy.
My life.
Tell me, where should I hit it?
- Can you see the pole there?
There's a hole under it,
hit it into that hole.
Hit!
- No way! I won't play this game.
You can play.
I don't know how to prove it to her.
I can't love seeing her face.
What did you say?
What did he say?
I said I can't love seeing your face.
A little bit of sweet...
a little bit of sadness...
A little of bit of romance...
a little bit of disaster...
If you carry on like this,
love for you will vanish.
What are you doing, Ram?
I'm trying to love.
I can't try anymore.
I can't take it anymore.
What's it sister?
Breaking off! That's what
I did till now, brother-in-law.
If breaking up is the solution
to the problem,
just a little time,
there are courts, laws, laywers and
people like me to break relationships.
But if love is the solution to
the same problem,
there's no one to tell you
how to do it, brother-in-law.
We must find it ourselves.
Brother-in-law always wishes
good for brother-in-law.
If you think no love is the
reason for this break up,
you must find it, brother-in-law,
I'm also trying to find it.
What do you want?
You can't give me what I want.
I'm asking you what is it?
What do you want me to do now?
I want love as vast as sea.
Who doesn't want it.
I too want love as vast as sea.
But how?
I can't get it with truth and
it won't stay with lies.
What do you want to do?
I don't know how to love.
I'm telling you openly
what I don't know.
Is it wrong?
What do you want me to do?
You better know it and tell me.
Hands off.
I told you hands off her,
can't you get it?
Why did you take anger on them
that you've for the girl?
Why did you come here, brother?
I'll take care of it.
Enough of what had happened,
you've already done enough damage,
when I hear the questions she asks,
I'm afraid of her future life,
I know Janu loves you,
that's why I'm asking you, just tell me
you'll live with her all the life,
I'll arrange your marriage,
if it's not possible,
never again show up in her life.
If you dare come again, I don't know
what will be the consequences.
Think and take a firm decision
and tell me right now here.
Why are you still thinking?
Go and tell her.
What should I tell her?
You always said people use
the moment to fall in love,
likewise there will be a moment of break,
which no one uses it.
Buddy, a time will come where
you've to lie to save a relationship.
This is it.
Tell you'll love her life long
so that she believes you.
If not you'll lose her permanently, go.
Go.
Tell.
- Tell.
What should I tell?
Even now what I said is right.
I can't love you all my life.
My foot! Look what he's saying!
- Why should I change?
I'm like this.
How was she?
When her friend's love got confirmed...
She said like that.
How lovely she was then!
Is it the same face?
While playing that chit game,
she childishly asked to pick a chit.
How cute she was then!
Now, look at her face.
She said, Ram, I saw a lion!
How excited she was then!
Is it the same face?
She said I didn't apply make up,
I'm natural beauty.
How innocent she was then!
Now irritation, fight for every
trivial thing, and anger too!
Forget about love, I feel like slapping...
- Come on slap me! Slap me!
You were always smiling.
Where's that smile?
You said till then my love is
all yours, where is that love?
It'll not be there, why would it there?
Are you the same Janu now?
But my love must be same always.
It won't be.
Am I a statue?
If that's it, why are you
thinking about it?
You need a reason to
break away from a girl, right?
There are so many reasons,
leave me alone.
I can't do that.
- Why?
I feel I'll spend my life with reasons.
What will you do then?
I'll love little more.
If that gets over.
Again I'll love little more.
What if it gets over?
- Damn fate will make me lose that also.
I'll try to love little more.
What if that also gets over?
What happened after that?
What happened after that?
What will happen after that?
- What happened after that?
What will happen?
What else would happen?
We don't understand
a word he says,
my brother told her to
leave him many times,
do you know what was
her reply for it?
She said she wants only him.
When asked why only him,
she says he knows to love,
and she can't find any other man
who can love her life long.
We agreed for it.
Did you see the result?
It seems they agreed,
what happened after that?
Loving a girl is easy,
if we don't like her,
it's much easier to break up,
but loving the same girl a little
more is hell, you know that?
What's this?
- Job in school.
Dad knows the school well.
Stop these graffiti and
these useless paintings.
Should I stop all this?
Are these useless paintings to you?
Can't even buy coffee or tea.
What's this for?
This is for me, for my pleasure.
- This is for me, decide now.
Me or graffiti?
She wants me to give up graffiti,
is she mad?
Why should I give it up?
Don't give it up.
Who is asking you to give it up?
Just tell her you've given it up.
That's all.
Till now you wrote graffiti by Ram,
write as Sam from tomorrow.
Look at me, she asked me
to quit smoking,
but I'm still smoking,
she asked me to quit drinking,
I'm carrying a bottle with me,
that's it!
Love means few lies, few SMS's,
cruel jokes, and a flower.
Learn how to maintian
a relationship successfully.
That's it, so simple.
I was coming getting your call,
he wanted to solve his problem,
I've solved it.
Shall we go now?
It's grave sin to act love for
the girl you love.
Hereafter you'll know who difficult
it is to tell truth.
That's why though difficult,
I'll tell only truth.
Let's go.
- Brother?
It's grave sin to act love for the
people we once loved.
It's not his fault.
I can't find a better man than him
who'll love my daughter truely.
Living together or breaking up,
it's their will and wish.
Will you stop it?
- Why should I?
I've learnt it from quite young age,
I will not quit.
I can understand one thing now, sir.
I feel the thought that I love
a girl is itself a big lie.
Because I feel I love myself
more than her.
The reason for me not to
love a girl is myself.
I, Ram is the reason.
Life shouldn't be spent with reasons.
All I've only one thing with me to
sacrifice for her, that's my ego.
Hereafter there's no graffiti in my life.
I'm going sir.
- Drop me in my home.
Home?
I too want to love a little.
- You...
What's your program now?
Get her to say I love you again.
Give me a good idea.
- How about a gift?
Lots of gifts are despised.
Suggest something better.
How about a flower?
- All of them give it.
I never gave her one.
Long back I gave one to
my teacher as a little boy.
I never gave it again to any girl.
What flower she likes most?
Can I take one, please?
I know.
Good!
With short stories of love,
a life long love story.
Not only your ideas,
your ideology is also good.
Why all this?
To see a sea, boss!
Chapatti?
- No rice...rice...
Trust me Maya, I'm telling truth,
I don't even drink coke now.
I don't feel like missing Janu.
Love is still pleasant to me.
For one side lovers like you,
love is always beautiful all the life.
But think little practically,
isn't it right what he says?
No Puppy.
Why did you bring me here?
You gave flowers, okay.
You joined the job, okay.
No need to quit graffiti for my sake.
What's your idea?
Don't I know about you boys?
You'll publicize about sacrificing
so many things for me.
All the girls are like this,
you tell everyone about sacrificing
so many things for us,
get going.
- Nothing like that.
I'll not take it from others.
Are you any less? You made
big show of loving little more.
I got it. You want me to
love little more, right? Come....
Yes, must give the card.
- Card?
Say I love you every day.
Don't I've any other work?
I'll spend all the day sending
you love notes.
Love me little more!
〰
