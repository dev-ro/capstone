You see? I built my life
by dismantling the mechanisms.
All, even the most complex ones.
As a kid
I used to harass magicians so that
they would explain their tricks to me.
And I've always achieved my goal.
(Fontaine bookstore)
(Book Fair, Frankfurt, Germany)
(English)
Now. Ladies and gentlemen,
I am extremely excited
and very proud to announce
Angstrom Publishing's
acquisition of the final book
of the Dedalus trilogy,
"The man who did not want to die."
the simultaneous translation
will begin in December
and the novel would be available
in all good bookstores in March.
(Copenhagen, Denmark)
(Danish) I thought when
we write, we do it at home.
That's why I married
you. This is going wrong.
- Carl, soon everything will change.
- How?
Trust me.
(Portugese)
Out of the way! Move!
(Lisbon, Portugal)
Let me pass!
Thank you.
I'm not coming back. I'm going
to work in France. Two months.
Are you kidding me?
Shit! They fired me!
Are you not going to work in France?
Since when one job is
enough to make a living?
(Italian) In Paris. I'm meeting
an old friend, Oscar Brach.
What are you doing? It is mine!
Just give up. He doesn't talk.
- Konstantinos Kedrinos, Greece.
- He took my phone! Damn!
Oh! You didn't read the contract.
Whatever. I have a second one.
(Gare du Nord, Paris, France)
(English)
What's up, mate?
(Villette Manor, France)
How was your trip?
Here is your badge.
At least we won't forget our names.
Even during a claustrophobic attack.
Please be careful, it's very ...
Doesn't matter. No problem.
It is mine... Thanks.
This is my work tool.
I need to record.
This device and so ...
cannot connect to internet.
Your working conditions are confidential.
You may not keep any traces.
- Confidence reigns.
- Paper and pencil are enough.
She looks like the dead woman in
Dedalus. She knows keeping the ambience.
Disordered identity. Probably
the result of troubles with daddy.
Alright. Let's go.
The Translators
Impressive, isn't it?
This is just the beginning.
- Alex Goodman.
- Chen Yao.
- You came straight from China?
- I've lived in Paris for twenty years.
I didn't know you were so young.
Dedalus was my first job. I was an
intern when the first volume came out.
Nobody wanted to take it. I was lucky.
Follow me.
Do you often sleep on the street?
This is my first time to visit Paris.
I wanted to save a little money.
I have saved more than 'a little'.
The manor belongs
to a Russian billionaire
a big fan of Dedalus, who's particularly
worried of the end of the world.
Thanks to his obsession We'll
able to protect Oscar Brach's work.
After you.
Your task is constrained
but prestigious.
This work of translation
for a worldwide simultaneous publication
is unprecedented.
It's a brilliant idea of Mr. Angstrom.
And also a clear political message.
Declaration of his fierce fight of
defending his authors against piracy.
You may consider yourself lucky
because you come from countries
where Dedalus sells the best.
All have been considered,
to make your isolation comfortable.
Tonight you will see your rooms.
They have the size of my appartment.
And each has a separate bathroom.
Internet access is strictly forbidden.
But you will receive international
newspaper every morning.
There is a movie collection which you
couldn't finish watching till you die.
We serve breakfast at 8 o'clock,
lunch at 13 and dinner at 21.
Except Sunday, working
hours will go from 9 to 20.
Mr. Angstrom is strict on hours.
Not bad for distracting oneself
from the apocalypse, right?
Please.
(Greek) Buried alive just to translate
this crap. Yes, it is the apocalypse.
Excuse me...
Good evening.
Éric
Dario Farelli. So happy to see
you again. Do you remember me?
Yes. You and all the rest.
Have a seat, please.
- Have a seat.
- Sure...
There are only the first 20 pages here.
I doubt you could translate
them in just one afternoon.
In the evening I will collect the sheets
and I'll bring you the next 20
pages tomorrow, if necessary
In one month you will have
translated 480 pages of volume 3.
You will also have a second
month dedicated to corrections.
In this library you will find
essentials of general knowledge,
more than anywhere else.
You don't like this place, Mr. Kedrinos?
If I wanted to work in an open-space,
I wouldn't have chosen this profession.
Sheets and computers may
not be taken out of this room.
The smoking room is to the
end of the corridor, Ms. Alves.
Our Russian friends will watch over you.
Great. Wish you a nice working day.
And as they say in France, "chin up"!
(Two months later)
(Prison of Bois d'Arcy, France)
I didn't think you'd agree to see me.
Culpability can be helpful.
Look.
They'll publish it anyway.
They use what happened to boost sales.
Take it. I brought it for you.
Your trophy, in a way.
You see? 1% of the proposals
sent to my desk are worth editing.
Of those, only 10% will be sold.
And only 1 or 2, will
become a best-seller.
It took me years
to make Angstrom Publishing a triumph.
You declared war on an industry
which employs millions of people
and generates billions.
You'll never get out of it.
I read it over and over again.
I've an idea that the
solution must be inside it.
I can't get it out of my head.
I need to understand how you did it.
From the moment Oscar Brach gave me the
manuscript, I had never let go of it.
Apart from him and me
nobody had ever held it.
And yet
it was inevitably
gotten into your hands.
When?
Do not look at me like
this. I will find out eventually.
- You want some, Javier?
- No thanks.
(German)
- Cheers!
I have to have your attention.
It will be two intensive months.
Probably not everyone is stressful.
- What?
- You snore a little. And you drool.
True.
You're lucky you have this
chance at such a young age.
- You must have talent.
- Yes, he has talent. Especially for naps.
- Everyone has his method of working
- I was late asleep.
And I never get started like that
in a translation, it must mature.
Why don't we have the complete text?
The vision of the collective is crucial.
- Angstrom treats us like robots.
- No.
He's just being prudent. That's all.
Are you sucking his dick or what?
He is a sadist, apparently.
It's frustrating.
Thought we would find
out who drowned Rebecca.
- And for what purpose.
- Sometimes I think Franck will discover
that Rebbeca simply committed suicide
- To save him from his past.
- No.
too disappointing.
And if it's Franck himself
who killed his wife?
Maybe he was under the will of Dedalus,
but he doesn't know it?
Rebecca has created this virus.
She made it from Franck, her guinea pig,
and it took revenge on her.
No.
That would be too banal.
That is true.
It doesn't make sense.
We've been waiting
for this for two years.
Two fucked up years.
This is not literature we are
talking, just a product of consumption.
The ending,
will not make this book a masterpiece.
(Italian) What are you talking about?
This is a worldwide best-seller!
- 1 Billion bucks of profits, for fuck's sake.
- Remind me, how much do you get from it? Nothing!
Oscar Brach, he is just like the others.
He will begin a derived
serie, then another,
and he will write the same book until he
finishes paying for his chalet in Switzerland.
There are some very serious studies
on Dedalus in some universities.
Universities too are
entering the world of business.
I know that. I lecture in Athens.
What are you doing here then?
Same as you.
I bend my neck against the Big
Capital, to not starve to death.
And we do it with joy.
- I have no choice.
- For you, it's just a simple job?
It's an honor, to be
of service of Dedalus.
(English)
"Rebecca ...
"or rather the ghost he had made of her.
"Franck was finding it increasingly
difficult to tell them apart.
"Rebecca had become a hazy presence.
"reminding him of ...
(German) "the guilt of this
moment, fraught with consequences."
(Italian) "An increasingly significant
feeling made of fleeting images…"
(Greek) "of the tragedy, which
was constantly remembered to him…"
(Russian)
"Rebecca."
"Her long brun hair wave
over the water of Seine.
"In her curls were reflected
the lanterns of the boats.
"Her dress rippled around her,
"like a pair of white wings."
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Thank you.
Good evening.
-Ms. Alves.
Thank you.
Mr. Farelli?
Yes, Éric.
Were you planning to meet Oscar Brach?
Is that what you tweeted?
No. It is a metaphor. I meant the book.
A little advertising won't hurt.
Please let me handle advertising.
Rose-Marie will take you
upstairs, to delete your post.
Alright.
Oscar Brach doesn't
follow our translations?
In these circumstances,
it would be possible.
We have signed a confidentiality contract.
His identity will remain safe and secret.
He is not interested
in practical details.
Practical details?
If I were in his place, I would like
to meet those who speak his voice.
It's about the quality of the text.
The quality of Dedalus does not
need to be proved, Mrs. Korbel.
It will end soon. If
necessary, I am next to you.
(Angstrom speaking English)
- What are you doing here?
- Rose-Marie told me to wait here.
Did you want to meet me?
The rythme of your translation
is impressive, Ms. Anisinova.
Thank you.
The publish of the third
volume with a book salon
in Paris will be a great event.
I am planning a conference.
Fans ...
Fans would go crazy
at the sight of Rebecca's double.
I'd... I'd rather tell
them about my work.
One does not exclude the other.
In Paris!
In Paris.
Were it not for this
fascination for Oscar Brach,
maybe the text would never be leaked.
You know...
the mystery of his identity,
the fact of being the sole custodian,
it only brought me trouble.
People talk about him.
That he's actually twins,
that he is a woman,
a former East Germany spy.
Some even thought it was me.
Barfleur, Normandy, France
Excuse me... The course of literature
and comparative studies, it's here?
I don't teach anymore, young
man. I was disappointed.
My best students prefered to go
into business. They earn big money.
They don't want to be said bad writers.
Someone who is hungry
knows that art won't feed him.
How do you do?
- How was the trip?
- It was long and boring.
- There are no crowds to this place.
- Let it stay that way.
Georges, why don't you
get rid of this bookstore?
You could travel around the
world with all your royalties.
- I have a great travel department.
- Yes I know.
I have just finished
the last dot of Dedalus.
"The man who did not want to die",
is waiting for you upstairs.
- I knew!
- Obviously.
Otherwise you wouldn't come here.
Oscar Brach is the only person I have
never managed to look through to date.
You belong to the
same category of people.
But not me.
I have never had imagination.
- Are you crazy?
- I thought you were gonna stay there.
I wanted to know what
Rebecca felt when she drowned.
For a translator you
have strange methods.
You are wrong about me, Katerina.
I am also a fan of Dedalus.
I've been watching you.
I feel the same as you.
The last volume has power.
Which writer is the inspiration
for Rebecca's monologues?
James Joyce. And his
stream of consciousness.
Devoid of the slightest
comma like that of Molly Bloom
from Ulysses.
Who is the dominant
narrator of the trilogy?
- All-knowing.
- Wrong. It's Rebecca.
This is your interpretation.
- Learn to read.
- The hero, anyway, is Franck.
Rebecca is the soul of this novel.
Franck's trajectory, is to
understand that he passed by her.
Dedalus is more than a detective novel.
It's a story of regret.
And you? What touches you in Dedalus?
I do not know.
Plenty of things. I like riddles.
You don't compare it with Joyce
just because you like puzzles.
For me this book mainly
talks about impossible
mourning
I know that well.
Angstrom didn't understand
the subtleties of this trilogy.
The way he talks
about it, is superficial.
He would do anything for money.
Someday he will regret it.
I'm glad I got to know you better
Alex Goodman.
Maybe you should give
others a chance to know you.
I understand what motivated you.
Except for money, of course.
The translator lives someone's life.
A name that no one will
remember, never will be on the cover.
And you ...
You have other ambitions.
And opportunities to fulfill them.
I have always treated you well.
I gave you your chance.
I can give you another.
On one condition...
Tell me what I want to know.
Talk to me, damn it!
(Portugese) Katerina is
ready for the great gameplay.
It will be a great duel!
She approaches, pulls ... She strikes!
It's unbelievable!
What are you doing?
Christmas is not for misanthropes.
- I've always had a weakness for champagne.
- You rascal!
- Thanks for the invitation.
- You are welcome.
I didn't want to leave you with
the boss. I have a good heart.
Ok Italian!
- Sorry!
- Now you're sorry?
Either we play or we don't play!
Okay, we don't play.
Hands serve Italians only to speak.
- You are gonna talk all those stereotypes?
- I love it.
- You're the worst.
- Why don't you dance flamenco?
Oh no, it's the Spanish.
I'm always confounded by
those two. Like everyone else is.
As for me, the Greeks invented,
wine, theater and democracy. Beat me.
That was 3,000 years ago.
- Exactly!
- And then you rested on your laurels.
And you don't pay taxes.
I was joking.
I would like to propose a toast.
Let these 3 weeks of
confinement prove wrong
to those who think that
fraternity is but a fantasy.
May I cite in Shakespeare's language ...

Hello Éric ...
(Portugese)
What the hell is going on?
"The first 10 pages of Dedalus
Volume 3 is not yours anymore.
"Five million euros will stop this leak.
"If you don't transfer this
amount within 24 hours,
"100 more pages will
appear online tomorrow.
"Keep on insisting and the
whole book slips out of your hands.
"Do not hesitate, but act at once.
"Only in this way will you regain peace.
"Be happy!
"Your bad luck will make
many fans of Oscar Brach happy.
"Many of them can translate
it with their flawless French
"to their languages
accurately and beautifully.
"The Internet overcomes cultural
boundaries and reunite people.
"What the world needs
now is love, sweet ... love."
Apparently you have a beautiful voice.
- Are you watching us?
- The culprit is among us.
Translation is suspended
for an indefinite period.
The last 100 pages will not
be distributed. Whoever did this
he won't be able to
carry out his threat.
Until we find him, you are
techniquely unemployed.
- And if you never find him?
- Do not worry, Éric.
We will find him. And
we will unmask him.
Any comments, Mr. Kedrinos?
I'm sorry but if you don't pay it now,
you'll be in your ass.
Nobody will buy a book which they have
already read most of it. You are fucked.
(Russian)
Stop it!
Have you lost your mind?
Rose-Marie, do something!
Everything will be handled very
quickly. It all depends on you.
- How much does the hacker want?
- 5 million.
You must notify the police.
This leak comes from one of the
translators. Let me take care of it.
I will find the greatest megalomaniac.
Maybe it's a woman. Your
misogyny will lose you!
This is not a phone!
Only you know the author,
and you have the manuscript.
We don't even know where you are!
That was the deal.
It's the panic. Foreign publishers
are threatening with lawsuits.
Please, check. I can even help.
We live on the revenue
forecasts of volume 3.
We are already in deficit.
If you do nothing, it's ruin
(Portugese)
Piss off!
You sons of bitches!
Hands off my things!
Let go!
- What does Oscar Brach think about this?
- He doesn't know.
- How is that?
- Either way, the thief is nearby.
It's just a matter of
time before I catch him.
I protect what is mine.
They attack me, and I defend. I'm not
preventing anyone from fighting back.
But people are so weak!
Look at you...
You are outraged, but you
are afraid to say it frankly.
- If I did that, I'd lose my job.
- So what?
- I like my work.
- Do you like being a maid?
No. I like literature.
Then be a publisher. It is not
my fault that people lack ambition.
This is a serious offense.
Angstrom is not above
the law. Neither do you.
No! No! Don't touch it! It is mine!
You've been hiding for
a long time, Mrs. Tuxen
This is not a transcription of Dedalus.
Anyone who knows Danish will testify.
(Danish)
You have a hopeless style.
I haven't finished it yet.
This is my first novel.
How long have you been working on this?
Tell me the truth!
Eight years.
But I had a real click here.
You know ...
your contract prohibits
any other activity
when working on the translation.
You don't know what family life is.
Two months in isolation is an
opportunity to finish the novel.
Alright, Mrs Tuxen.
You don't have talent.
Somewhere deep inside,
there's a little voice
keeping telling you that,
but you pretend you don't hear it.
Illusions are nothing good.
One day you will thank me.
What are you talking about!
- Someone wants to set me up!
- "He who blushes is already guilty.
"True innocence is nothing
to be ashamed of. " Rousseau.
Whoever it is - respect!
If he needs help, let me know.
Are you crazy? The
hacker's also fucking us.
Who earns the least here?
What? Only the poor robs the rich?
Get down to earth, Dario!
Why would this be one of us?
- Why not Rose-Marie?
- Or maybe the guardians? Or chefs?
No. They didn't play bowling with us.
- They didn't hear me sing.
- Rose-Marie did.
And she gave you to Angstrom.
Rose-Marie is a good
girl. She would not do that.
Angstrom must pay. And quickly.
He will never pay.
In detective stories you don't pay the first
ransom. And this is the beginning of troubles.
The second increases the
pressure, but neither is it payed.
Nobody breaks before the
third one. But it's too late.
"A puzzle is a sequence of simple
things. " Dedalus, Volume 1, Chapter 4.
Exactly! We must think like the hacker!
If I were him, I would copy
the text at one time or another.
When? We spent the days
together. We would have noticed.
- In the night.
- What about network access?
Someone must have
brought into the bunker
a smartphone in spare parts.
And where would he hide it?
He always carries it with him.
Remind me how you did it
- I fell off my bike.
- When?
Yes, when?
About a month ago.
Telma!
Are you crazy?
He couldn't pretend.
There's nothing there.
If we look after each other,
the hacker will not be able to continue.
I don't offer you a drink ...
Come on, Alex. I no longer
believe in your pose, young man.
You will not sink in
the paranoid, not you ...
You're lying, from the beginning.
I checked everything before coming here.
You never translated "Rebecca's Bite",
nor "The Kiss of Poison".
I got in a trouble, Katerina.
(London, England)
(English)
Alright, go on.
We can't get anything out of him.
He refuses to speak to
anyone but Oscar Brach.
Does he want to get paid for his illegal translations, too?
Just give me the papers. Let's get this over done with.
Are you really sure you
want to take this to court?
Prosecuting a fan will a be
terrible publicity for the Dedalus.
You are playing with a
dangerous game, young man.
In France, criminal copyrighting
will give 5 years in prison,
and 300,000 euro
fine, if your are lucky.
And in UK you can double that.
And I am not known for my mercy.
Did you show my
translations to Oscar Brach?
They are better than
yours. His fans prefer mine.
Real fans do not steal, they buy.
Real fans downloaded my version
10 million times in under two weeks.
How is business for you?
You think you are really smart, don't you?
Well that didn't stop you from getting caught.
Maybe I wanted to get caught.
You will never ever meet Oscar Brach.
Even if he were interested in you.
Particular case I will do you a favor.
Hire me, to translate book 3,
- Officially.
- You are taking a piss.
- In honor of Oscar Brach.
- I already have an English translator.
Aaron Troy? He turns out shit.
Becoming a translator
will not help you meet Oscar Brach.
But it can't hurt my chances.
You have everything to gain,
and nothing to lose.
I work for free.
I know his work better
than anyone. Fuck's sake.
Alright that's enough.
Take him back to his cell!
I can guess the first
sentence of Volume 3.
Easy.
What's he saying?
Are you afraid that I can guess?
Can you leave us for the moment, please?
Come on.
Go ahead.
Impress me.
How did you do that?
The first sentence of Volume 2
is composed by the first words
of each chapter of Volume 1.
I relied on Oscar Brach's math.
and deduced that it'll also
work for Volume 2 and 3.
Brilliant.
But Angstrom is now
convinced that the hacker is me.
I wanted to meet Oscar Brach,
but I would never use it to make money.
I couldn't betray him.
You have already cheated on him by sharing
translations of the first two volumes.
The English translation
was just like Angstrom.
Tinsel without depth.
Readers have signed petitions
to replace the translator.
If the culprit is not found,
I'll be dead.
I almost stole the manuscript.
I could have done more. I
wanted to know the ending.
Do you know where Angstrom hides it?
He never parts with the
briefcase. It was easy to guess.
And the code?
123, the most common.
Immediately after - 321.
567.
765.
666, the number of Satan.
911, for September 11.
365 - number of days in the year.
069 - sexual position.
007.
777, three times the sacred number.
These are the most commonly used
number combinations for suitcase locks.
Dedalus Volume 1, chapter 15.
For Angstrom, obviously, it's
sex position that worked out.
You are flying to London.
Bring me everything you
find about Alex Goodman.
Prove me that you
really love literature.
OK. Let's not waste time ...
Éric? I'm in Goodman's apartment.
Nothing here, I'm sorry.
However, there is something that
worried me throughout the whole journey.
Three translators live upstairs
at the mansion since their arrival.
I think they could have
access to the network.
I had an eye for
Mr. Farelli and Mrs. Tuxen.
But not Mrs. Anisinowa.
Alright. Everything will
be clear in a moment.
We will see for whom this
situation is the hardest to endure.
Come on!
Try sending me an email now!
"My Dear Érik,
I see you are in no hurry.
I have just offered 100
more pages to the world.
20 million euros will
save what you have left.
You have already abused
my generosity too much.
I'll give you six hours,
before my adventures
continue to escape you.
Make the right decision
and take a little on yourself.
"He who blushes is already guilty.
"True innocence
"is nothing to be ashamed of. "
So what?
Now it's Ingrid's fault?
Yes. I said that.
It's some black magic.
"Magic is not of this world."
Dedalus, Volume 2,
Chapter 10.
You also know by heart
all pages of Volume 3?
- That's how you did it, right?
- Sorry?
Don't play innocent! You play Rebecca,
you work 10 times harder
than the rest, put every effort
to get my attention, to let
me invite you to the office.
- It wasn't premeditated ...
- All of you is premeditated!
It's her! It's obvious.
- You are trying to sow discord.
- I protect what is mine!
Dario, stop!
I'm still here because
of you! You bitch!
Stop!
Alex, no!
Get lost!
I know it's you.
I know! And I'll prove it.
You will see! I know it!
As long as no one has reported,
you won't get anything from me.
- You are not gonna let us starve?
- I do not care.
It will be fine.
It will not. We need water and heating.
We need more food.
Show a little more understanding!
Relax, Javier.
The worst has passed.
Great!
- Javier?
- Why is it dark?
- These bastards do it on purpose.
- Light!
All good?
We have to get out of here somehow.
Anyone waiting for you outside?
Maybe my dog.
My lovers.
And they ...
they can have fun without me.
My daughter.
But she is already big.
I haven't seen her in a few months.
We've become strangers.
Don't worry, Helene.
You are very lucky.
- Your husband and children love you.
- But I don't.
- You don't think so?
- I don't. This is terrible.
And I don't think I can be more sober.
Since I am here, I feel ...
although I try to convince
myself of the contrary ...
I don't miss them.
None of them, even the baby.
As if for me they were ...
only concepts.
All I wanted in my youth
was to write novels,
travel around the world.
I never wanted children.
It's Carl who insisted.
So I made him happy.
I've always been doing that.
I make everyone happy.
That's what made me want
to write. Make people happy.
But I was afraid to go action.
While wanting my husband,
my children to consume my time,
my creative space.
To them, I just wanted
to be a translator.
And not an author worthy of the name!
Without ever admitting it to me, but ...
but cutting me off them anyway.
The truth is I can't write.
But keep telling myself the contrary.
I lost on all fronts.
You coaxed me at the first glance.
You wore a mask. I was fooled.
You and me, we are cold-blooded beings.
So give me a chance.
Give me a chance!
Please!
We have it.
And that's it. "Please."
The magic word.
It wasn't that hard, right?
For someone without imagination,
you really tell some neat stories.
- I was only telling the truth.
- It rests to be verified.
And you've always missed one detail.
You are the one in prison.
- Not me.
- I am innocent.
- It's a matter of legal defense.
- "He who blushes is already guilty."
"True innocence is
nothing to be ashamed of. "
What the hell do you want?
I have said it clearly
from the beginning.
To meet Oscar Brach.
If I were you,
I would finally decide to persuade him.
Inter folia fulget.
So if I finish choice of
translators for the bunker
in October,
I can order printing in February.
I found an extremely secure place.
- World premiere around ...
- Wait, Éric.
You want some time to polish the text?
You always ask.
And every time I tell you
that everything is perfect.
And I'm right.
I don't want to work with you anymore.
- Sorry?
- I have an appointment with other publishers,
next week.
- I hope it's a joke.
- I have never signed an exclusive contract.
Well, I will give you
a million increase.
And I'll double the royalties on
sales. Does that work for you?
I will reimburse you in
advance. It's not about money.
So what is it about?
About loyalty.
- To myself.
- What about loyalty to me?
I have always respected
your wish of anonymity.
I fought for Oscar Brach to become
someone. That's how you thank me?
Do you know how much we've invested in
it? This must be a success of the year!
We need it badly. I need it.
Stay here overnight.
And read it calmly.
I want you to be the first
one who knows the ending.
It's really an honor!
You piss me off!
I can never please you! Nothing
has changed since university!
When I came to you
Angstrom Publishing was a small building
who treated her books like real works.
Now you are selling Dedalus
like ordinary toothpaste,
to gain maximum out of it.
You are consumed by profit.
Success is nothing dirty.
If you dared to write yourself,
you would understand me.
You can't do this to me!
You are ready to lock the
translators in the bunker,
to treat them like cattle.
You've lost your sense
of humanity, of creation.
- What are you doing?
- I'm working.
Others have forgot why we are here.
Me too. I have always
found refuge in books.
IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME
You know why I force the
resemblance to Rebecca?
This is like an armor.
I feel invincible.
It's strange to find your strength
by identifying yourself with a victim.
She is not a victim.
Au contraire. She got killed
because she had power.
First sentence of Volume 3,
is not composed by the first words
from each chapter of Volume 2.
You lied to me.
- You're the hacker.
- Stop it! I will never hurt you.
- I do not know who you are anymore...
- I'm just a fan of Dedalus.
I didn't lie to you on the eseentials.
Don't you want to know who Oscar Brach is?
I respect his will of
remaining anonymous.
I don't know your story,
but it has done something to you.
You became one of his heroines.
He could express your suffering.
Only he understands you.
What do you say to
him if you can meet him?
Nothing. When you stand in front of Oscar
Brach, you wait for him to speak first.
I want to be there too.
I have come to give
you a lesson of magic.
Why have you changed your mind?
- You hurt me too much yesterday.
- Fuck off.
What is the golden rule of Franck Hardy?
"Always look in the right direction."
which echoes Rebecca's drowning.
If he had gone to starboard
first, Franck could have saved her.
Thanks. I know the story.
That is what he will then try
to do during his investigations.
To look in the right direction.
And?
Your mistake,
- is that you think everthing happened in the bunker.
- You acted in advance.
But that still doesn't explain to me
how you took over the manuscript.
- I always had it with me.
- I know.
And I also know that your day is regulated
like clockwork. You leave Angstrom Publishing,
every evening at 19:40,
and you go straight home.
You sit in the same place every time,
in the middle of the metro train.
Melted with the crowd.
More punctual than a train.
You have 13 stations
between Glacière and Passy.
Intervals between 2 stations of
lines 6 are 1 minute and 18 seconds,
therefore your whole journey
would be 15 minutes and 36 seconds.
A week before entering the bunker,
unconsciously you did
a journey with an empty briefcase.
I replaced it in your journey.
You crazy!
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
666.
911.
365.
- Come on!
- No!
069.
We don't have time.
Come on! Come on!
007.
Come on.
- We are doomed.
- Shut up!
777.
We have it!
Riso GD7630 is the Rolls
Royce among photocopiers.
It copies 170 pages per minute.
With two machines,
we need 1 minute and 36 seconds,
to get to the end of 480 pages
of Dedalus, Volume 3.
- Do you know what our risk is?
- Prison.
You're already in prison, Ingrid.
We serve an absurd system
who oppresses us, though it needs us.
You are too intelligent to obey.
Liberty is an abstract concept in China.
Do you censor your translations yourself?
Or there's a committee who does it?
A committee. I have
learnt to censor in advance.
Publishers like Angstrom
accept it to access the market.
They are the criminals.
You don't gain any
profit from the sales.
While 500 million people
speak your language.
Is it fair?
- I don't have a choice.
- We always have a choice.
It must be tripping you to
be treated like a ... sh-sh-shit.
- (Spanish) Don't you make fun of me! You hear that?
- The best thing is,
that nobody will suspect you.
I am your chance in life, Javier.
I chose the craziest ones. The smartest.
The most exploited. The bravest.
Tell me. Why would I trust you?
This is not the first time I do so.
(Portugese)
Please.
Thanks.
Wait, Chen!
Move it, damn it!
What, what the hell ...
Watch out!
Bastard!
Out of the way, sheep!
Oh fuck!
We are dead! Shit!
Alex!
Shit!
Who helped you?
- Who?
- I've told you how.
I won't tell you who.
Magician never reveals all the tricks.
It looks...
But we will catch them
in one way or another.
If you say so ...
-Do you believe this kid
capable of diverting millions?
He would never say
where the money is anyway.
"Crime is a form of theater."
Dedalus, Volume 1, chapter 9
You are worse than me.
- Thank you, sir.
- That was unbelievable.
They are awful. I didn't
dare to touch them.
Horses, birds,
pigs ... cool, but rats?
- Where did you learn to drive like that?
- Trust me. You do not want to know.
- Do you have a license?
- I had to toucht it! Touch a rat!
I was afraid!
- I hate it!
- Quiet!
- Who wants to be the first one to read this?
- (English) Be our guest, sir.
No privileges. We read it aloud.
Wonderful!
Who's gonna read it?
Not me. That could ...
take some time.
May I start?
Go ahead. I see you are dying to do it.
Oscar Brach. Volume 3, Dedalus.
"The man who did not want to die"
Let these 3 weeks of
confinement prove wrong
to those who think that
fraternity is but a fantasy.
May I cite in Shakespeare's language ...
"What the world needs now"
Rather sing it.
Go ahead, again.
How is it?
♪ What the world needs now ♪
Ah yes!
♪ is love, sweet love ♪
And together, come on!
♪ No not just for some,
but for everyone ♪
It's ok?
(Italian)
Help! Help!
She cracked before being exposed.
Mrs. Tuxen didn't have
courage of a pirate.
She lacked courage of
big things, to be frank.
She finally faced reality.
That's it. Your collaborators
will come and get us out.
- as soon as they learn about Helene's death.
- They must find out first!
It's cold enough here that the
body will survive for some time.
Nobody will leave the library!
Our sincere condolences.
- Did I wake you up?
- Tell me what's going on, Rose-Marie.
The apartment was reliable,
except for one small detail.
There were no toiletries
in it. No soap, nothing.
Nobody lives in it.
Neighbors have confirmed that
they've never seen Goodman.
He's the one you want.
We have no discover when
we have nothing to hide.
So where does he live?
I don't know ...
You are gonna start
doing something, idiot!
You are gonna move heaven
and earth and find me his hideout!
Do you understand?
You are not tired?
I hope Angstrom pays your overtime.
If you want to relax, we
can find a secluded place.
I can do some great massages.
- What?
- Maybe we will never leave here.
Just as well take advantage
of the time we have left.
Chen! Éric knows ... He knows.
- He knows what?
- That it's us.
He makes us pay for it from the start.
When I fell ... his pen dropped
out ... from the briefcase.
What are you talking about?
He certainly noticed.
Listen...
We must stay calm now.
What are you doing?
Enough of this!
It must end!
I understand how you feel.
But Helene would have
acted out here or elsewhere.
You know nothing!
I'd rather be in jail than spend
even a second more here.
Javier.
Are you the hacker?
I asked you a question, Javier
You are the hacker.
"My Dear Érik,
"I didn't know you had
self-destructive tendency.
"200 more pages have just
slipped out of your hands forever.
"80 million. That's the total
amount of your punishment.
"You have 20 minutes from now.
"Before the whole book
goes to other places.
"Make the right choice.
"I protect
"what is mines."
Tell me how to stop
it or I'll shoot you!
A remote system sends emails
at specific dates and times.
If you shoot me you will
say adieu to the third volume.
Ah, you want to play?
Great. We'll play now.
We'll start with the country
where we earn the least.
He has nothing to do with
it. It's a matter between us.
You could have thought of this.
Shoot me, son of a bitch. At
least I will have some vacation.
- (Spanish) We have to do something...
- In French, stuttered.
He does not understand.
If we unite we can defend ourselves.
- What shall we do?
- Let's split into two groups.
First group distracts the guards,
the other takes care of him.
- They are persuading each other. I don't know Spanish.
- You should know better, you moron!
- I'm on your side.
- (Mandarin) Fuck!
- I do not know Spanish!
- I know.
(Spanish)
Continue. I'll translate.
Stop this!
All can be stopped now,
it just depends on you.
And what do you suggest?
Call Oscar Brach and
pass the phone to me.
- Too late, Alex.
- We are almost there.
(Spanish)
We must act together.
Telma, Chen and Javier,
deal with the guards.
Ingrid and me, we throw
ourselves on this bastard.
- Stop!
- (Mandarin) Telma, Chen and Javier.
Deal with the guards. Ingrid and
me, we throw ourselves on this bastard!
(Greek)
I don't speak Spanish nor Mandarin.
You asked for it!
Whatever you want to do, do it now.
(Spanish)
Let's do it! On three!
Wait! Everyone knows
counting to three in Spanish.
Even him.
In Mandarin.
(Mandarin) One...
- Two...
- Three!
-Katerina.
I'm not the only one
under time pressure.
I can do nothing. Everything
sends from my computer in London.
If you don't make the transfer, the text
will be automatically sent to the net.
Give me your address. The real one!
- Give me that!
- Do something!
Call an ambulance.
- Code?
- 1415.
Find me that goddamn computer.
You have won. Call an ambulance now!
Everything alright, Éric?
Yes, Rose-Marie. Everything is so great.
You are going to save
Angstrom Publishing.
If I have been hard on you, it's because I've always
believed in you. Sales Director. Will it be good for you?
Your shit life will
change into bright future.
Rose-Marie, are you there?
Have you found it?
Rose-Marie, have you found it?
Call a fucking ambulance!
Smash that goddamn computer.
If necessary, even with a hammer!
Éric?
I really love literature.
Yes? So what?
Well, go fuck youself.
We have to pay now.
But Éric, we don't have that amount.
Add in my shares.
- Account number?
- I've already sent it.
Done.
It's over now.
"My Dear Éric,
"Dedalus has slipped away from you.
"Even the pages you haven't given to me.
"You will have nothing
against the twists and turns
"that made the glory of the trilogy.
"I don't give a damn to your money.
"It's your skin that I want.
And I think I've had it. "
Call Oscar Brach.
(Russian)
No! Stop!
Enough!
Angstrom has just lost his job. We too.
Come on.
"Something hanging in the
air, something like a caress,
"seemed to be calling him.
"Rebecca.
"No matter how much she
forgave him in imaginary oaths
"that he addressed only to himself,
"she accused him as
soon as he closed his eyes.
"Truth remained truth.
"He was his only murderer,
"the one he had wanted
to confuse so desperately
"that he had looked in the
face every morning of his quest
"without knowing it,
"while watching himself in the mirror."
80 million euros.
You have extorted 80 million from me.
Where's the money?
What good will it do to you?
The last thing.
When we met in London, you
guessed the first sentence of Volume 3.
That was before you
stole the manuscript.
How did you do that?
Shit. I can't hear them.
What's happening there?
It's me who wrote it.
I hope this book to be worth it.
You know what I mean.
I wanted to know the
ending. I left mine at home.
A round trip to get it would
have been more reasonable.
It's in my mom's, in London.
I spend summer with my dad.
He's French and a spoiler, like you.
Shall we make a deal?
If you guess who is
the Orient Express killer
you may keep the book.
What if I don't guess?
There is a lot to do here.
I think everyone is guilty.
You see this cardboard box?
Take the books out of it and
place them on the shelves.
Yes yes. Work.
What is your name?
Alex Goodman.
I read Dedalus.
It's shitty. You can say that.
It's really great.
The perfect marriage of Anglo-Saxon
dramaturgy and the French language.
Impressive. And I know
exactly whom I will send it to.
I didn't write it because I wanted to publish it.
I just wanted to prove to you that I can do it.
And you've proved it.
You finally listened to
me. Your heroes are alive.
You learned to observe people,
describe them in your own way.
But we don't write for ourselves.
People need good books.
- And this one is more than good.
- No, Georges.
I never dare.
"The wind is breaking up.
You have to try to live."
I will not let this text
stay in the drawer.
If you really want it to be published,
You have to pretend to be the author.
You are not serious?
Why not?
Then we should come up with a nickname.
And you chose...
"Oscar Brach".
Fix this mess up here. I hear nothing!
- Enough! I'm going to get the kid.
- Wait. We don't have any evidence.
There is only one culprit
in this story. Éric. It's you.
Lock the translators in a bunker?
Treat them like cattle?
This guy doesn't have any respect.
Neither for people nor creation.
You wanted to stay in the shadows.
Let me handle the affairs.
You don't handle anything.
Angstrom tells nonsense about Dedalus.
He sells it like ordinary toothpaste.
Whether you want it or
not, you owe him success.
I owe myself and no one else!
Have you read this book?
IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME
It opened it to me
infinite perspectives.
People don't care who sold it to them.
From between the pages,
is knowledge.
Inter folia fulget.
Text has more power than
anything else, you know?
Only the text will remain.
Writing.
Trust the literature.
Ladies and gentlemen. I am extremely
excited and very proud to announce,
Angstrom Publishing's acquisition of
the final book of the Dedalus trilogy,
"The man who did not want to die."
... this is very very tough negotiation
between Oscar Brach and myself
and I could also safely
say that I got the advantage.
Protect what's yours and do not stop.
I'm sure Oscar Brach will not regret it.
the simultaneous translation
will begin in December
and the novel would be available
in all good bookstores in March.
So, ladies and gentlemen, your
second quarter is going to be a...
Real English translation
of Dedalus 1 and 2
You can't be Oscar Brach!
You really think I replaced your suitcase
in the metro without your knowing it?
You had the original
manuscript all the time.
I didn't need to steal it.
Just need to let the others believe it.
The truth, is that you have
nothing to be stolen from.
"Protect what’s yours"?
What is really yours?
My books?
You only buy them.
And you know what is the funniest?
When I tell investigators
to check your account ...
they will find 80 million on it.
What are you talking about?
The story is marketable, right?
The publisher locked
translators in the bunker,
to make it look like he was hacked
and put everyone to sleep by
diverting a monstrous ransom.
- Nobody will believe you. You're the hacker!
- Nobody accused me, except you."
Neither Rose-Marie nor the
translators, not even the guards.
You bribed them, hacker!
Now you know who I am.
You're lying!
You can't be Oscar
Brach. Because he is dead!
I killed that bastard with my own hands!
That's all I wanted to hear.
I 'm going in.
I didn't kill Oscar Brach.
Oscar Brach, it's him!
- It's him.
- Sure.
I'm telling you it's him.
I couldn't have killed him.
Because it's him. He is Oscar Brach!
Don't be sad, big boy.
You will come back here next year.
