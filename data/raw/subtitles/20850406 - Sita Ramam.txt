Waheeda! Stop!
Waheeda, stop, Waheeda!
You will fall, Waheeda.
Waheeda…
Hey, Rasool!
They are calling you in.
- Where is he playing?
- Here comes Rasool.
He's asking about you.
Boss has been waiting for you, Rasool.
Come, Rasool, come.
Five of you will cross the border today
and step into Kashmir by God's grace.
Kashmir?
What for?
Operation Gibraltar.
Peace be upon you, sir.
Peace be unto you.
Ashraf Sareen.
8Ak Front' s battalion.
Oh! 8 A K?
- Who are these people?
- They are terrorists, sir.
What are they doing here?
They are preparing for
Operation Gibraltar, sir.
What? Operation Gibraltar?
What is that?
Joint mission by Pakistan army
and terrorists to occupy Kashmir.
Probably the preparations
are for the same, sir.
Preparation?
What do you mean?
I will explain, Rasool…
Those who read the Quran and the Gita
are living as one fraternity in Kashmir…
The Indian Army is the reason.
Kashmiri Muslims seem to repose more and
more faith in the Indian Army these days.
We must burn that trust.
But how?
Who will help us?
The Indian Army itself.
You are going to create
an earthquake in Kashmir.
Say god is great!
God is great.
Say god is great.
God is great.
Stupidity!
Why would the Army
work with terrorists?
I don't have any information about it!
I have to seize the vehicle.
- Hello!
- Morning, Sir.
Captain Tariq.
- There is a problem.
- I am aware, Tariq.
It's your responsibility
to help them reach their destination.
-But I don't have any orders.-
-It's an order now, Tariq.
Keep it off the record.
Yes, sir.
Hmm!
Peace to you.
May peace be upon you.
Major Tariq!
I am getting the pitch ready to
play cricket with the Indian Army.
Go and play. Come back with the trophy.
Kashmir.
So, you guys know
what you have to do in Kashmir.
We should go to Kashmir and
live like the locals.
And?
No one should suspect us
to be Mujahidin.
Take care of Waheeda.
God be with you.
These kids are not even 18.
They are minors.
This spark will one day
become a fire in Kashmir.
All the snow will melt into water.
Riots broke out last night between
Indian and Pakistani students
leading to the desecration of the
National Flag of Pakistan
further escalating the situation
and enraging Pakistani students.
Over to our correspondent
who has the Pakistani Youth President
in London with her.
Hi, meet the Pakistani
Youth President, Afreen.
Ms Afreen, what do you think
of the present situation?
It's two days since the Indian students
burnt the flag of Pakistan.
We all know about it!
No, no. That's intentional.
They desecrated it deliberately.
I am very sure about it.
We will show you who we are.
We will answer them in 24 hours.
One bottle of whisky, please.
Which one?
The one that burns.
Hail, Pakistan!
Where is Afreen?
Does she have any idea
who is waiting here?
An and Mehta.
The car you set ablaze yesterday was his.
He sponsors countless
underprivileged students.
The Dean's spoken to him.
Just say you are sorry.
Do you know who he is?
I don't care.
Hello!
I am An and Mehta.
Afreen.
Why a lady as young as you are …
Is so full of anger?
Simple.
To find a solution.
There is only one solution for your rage,
Your hatred and your violence.
And that is love.
Oho!
So, you are the kind of guy who shows
the other cheek when slapped on one, right?
Like your man, Gandhi?
Afreen!
Behave yourself.
Mr An and! I am so sorry.
Not you, Dean.
She should be saying sorry to me.
That's not going to happen, Dean.
Impossible.
Do we have any other option?
Enough!
You are rusticated
from this campus immediately.
No, Dean.
I would never allow a child's education
or future to be ruined by me.
Afreen…
Everyone makes mistakes.
It's natural.
That's not a big deal.
You know, Afreen?
Those who are not brave enough to apologise
have no right to make mistakes.
Realise your mistake and apologise.
Otherwise, the option I can give you is-
One month…
One million for the damages to my car.
Or then...
you will be rusticated.
And I should make sure...
that you land in prison.
Deal!
I will pay you the ten lakhs in a month.
Hmm?
It's two years
since you spoke to your grandpa.
Will he give you a million
as soon as you ask?
Afreen, a sorry costs you ten lakhs.
One million! Think again.
I prefer apologising to my grandpa.
Never to an Indian.
I called you hundreds of times
to tell you this.
Probably you didn't want to respond.
If you did, you would know …
Brigadier Abu Tariq is no more.
How did he pass away?
Thinking about you..
Don't make a villain of me. He was the one
who sent me to London against my wish.
You know whatever he does
is for your own good.
Who told you London would reform me?
Huh?
Is it a crime to love your country?
Who said it's wrong?
It is not wrong to love your country.
But to hate your neighbouring country
is wrong.
Why did you come now?
I need ten lakhs immediately.
Give it to me and I will leave.
Listen, uncle.
I have no time to listen to your silence.
He was my grandfather.
He must have left some thing for me?
Dear Afreen…
By the time you returned
I would probably be gone.
This letter, probably, is the last
conversation between you and me.
I was sending you to London
against your wish,
you left without looking back.
I was amused by your anger.
It's is true I am dying with sadness.
But you are not the reason for it.
It's me.
I broke my promise.
I broke my word to It. Ram.
Twenty years ago,
It Ram entrusted me with a responsibility.
You must deliver this letter
to Sitamahalakshmi.
I don't know
how eagerly Sita is waiting for this
or what story this letter is carrying.
This is a help your grandpa
is seeking from you.
A debt you must settle.
This is a war a soldier
handed over to his enemy, Afreen.
You must make Sita and Rama
win this war.
You must make them win, Afreen.
What is this?
He left me a postman's job?
Why should a Pakistani soldier make friends
with an Indian soldier?
Meaningless!
First arrange for my money.
I will get this letter delivered.
Sorry.
Until this letter reaches Sitamahalakshmi,
I cannot give you even a single rupee
from his property.
This was the will
written by your grandfather.
This is not a help
sought by your grandfather.
A debt you must settle.
Sita… Ram.
This is Captain Akram reporting.
Hope you are enjoying the flight so far.
AI 372 has just entered
into the Indian air space.
We would be landing soon.
Taxi! Taxi!
Where do you want to go, madam?
Take me to Noorjehan Palace.
In 1966, Princess Noorjahan, in
order to provide higher education to girls
donated her palace to the government.
If you want to know more about the palace,
please meet one of the college trustees
Mr Subramanyam.
He was an accountant
at the palace those days.
I don't know what to do.
I am clueless.
One of our seniors,
Balaji, is in Hyderabad.
He'll help you out there.
Okay?
Ram… Sita…
Balaji… Not such names.
Tell me if you have our names. Idiot!
What you need right now is not our people.
- Someone who can help you.
- Whatever.
- How much?
- Two rupees.
Namaste, Junior!
Balaji! Placed me?
Welcome to India.
I heard you need some help?
Don't worry.
You have Balaji.
He will take care of everything.
So, what is your work?
I have to deliver this letter.
Why did you come to deliver this letter?
You could have put it in the box!
It would have delivered itself.
Turn it over and see.
Oh! Return stamps.
Two times.
Crazy, right?
So, that was tried.
- Ah?
- Twenty years ago.
Holding a letter written in 1965,
you got off the plane in 1985!
Who wrote this antique piece?
Ram.
- Who is Ram?
- No idea.
Forget it.
- Who is Sita?
- I don't know.
Forget it again.
Do you at least know
what is written in the letter?
No, Balaji.
You came here twenty years later
to deliver this letter…
And I put aside my wedding work
and came to help you!
Either you should have some sense
or I some shame.
All because of An and Mehta.
Who is the new character now?
It's a long story, Balaji.
Let's talk on the way.
Your grandpa gave you a letter
on his death bed.
If you keep this letter in Sita's hands,
the lawyer will keep the property documents
in your hands.
Wow, junior!
I was actually thinking.
You would not raise your little finger
unless you have something to gain.
Here. This is the address
of Subramanyam & Co.
Sitamahalakshmi!
Ah, ah, ah!
There is no one by that name
in this palace, mister.
Sir! Sir, try to remember, sir.
Please.
Sir?
What are you doing?
You asked me to remember.
That's not what I meant, sir.
She came all the way here
from some other country. That's why.
Even if she came from another planet,
there would be no change in my answer.
It's not that, sir.
- What is it, then? Hold on.
- Huh?
- Look, dear.
- Sir!
I had worked for forty years
in the palace.
There were more than
400 employees working.
From those 'more'
and to the rows below…
You must have missed Sitamahalakshmi
somewhere in the middle.
Language…
Is important.
I used to disburse salaries those days.
It was Nizam's palace.
Hindus were not more than thirty.
- What about Sitamahalakshmi?
- You won't find her.
Why?
Because there is no one named Sitamahalakshmi
in the past, present or future.
Why talk about ghosts, sir, now?
I will kill you.
I will dump you in Musi if you irritate me.
Me?
Yes, you!
- Hey, Ganapati!
- Sir?
I am afraid I will die listening to him.
Throw them into the store room.
Let them search.
Sitamahalakshmi…
Sita's name is nowhere.
Hello?
Ah…Afreen! How are you?
Not at all good.
It's no longer a palace.
It's a college.
And there is no one named
Sitamahalakshmi in the palace.
Do you understand?
That's why the letter was returned
so many times.
Afreen, that's not my problem.
Instead of telling you the truth,
if I lie that the letter was delivered
and throw it in the trash bin,
what will you do?
You make mistakes.
But you are not an
unethical person, Afreen.
I know you will never depend on lies.
Delivering that letter to Sita
is not just your grandfather's wish.
It's also twenty years of his failure.
It's your responsibility
to make your grandfather win, Afreen.
If you open this letter and read it,
you may find some solution.
My grandpa could have done it.
But he wanted to do
what Ram asked him to.
What is this bonding between two enemies?
Ram should know.
No one knew about Sita in 1965.
What would they know about her in 1985?
Your time travel ended before it started.
No. It has just started.
How is that?
You said it.
That Ram should know.
To find Sita,
we should first know about Ram.
If we find out about Ram,
it becomes easy to find Sita.
He is not Ayodhya Ram
to get immediate information.
- He is just Lieutenant Ram.
- Exactly.
Lieutenant Ram.
- Madras regiment.
- So?
- Service year 1965.
- So what?
That's enough to catch hold of him.
But how?
I is Balaji.
He will take care of everything.
Do something, uncle.
Nephew! What do you have in your mind?
Is this a grocery shop to provide
whatever information you ask?
This is Indian Army.
Why did you come all the way
from London to know about Ram?
Err… I am writing a book, sir
- A small research work.
- Oh!
There is a library downstairs.
Civilians are allowed on Mondays.
Any luck?
No, sir.
Keep trying.
You might find something.
Ram!
- Balaji! Balaji!
- Huh?
Look, Ram!
- It's a checkmate.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.
This is Ram.
Ram?
Hmm. I don't know him.
Oh!
This is Vikas.
From our place.
I am sure he knows Ram.
Huh! Can you give me his address?
Mr Vikas!
Can I talk to you about Lieutenant Ram?
I want to talk to you about Lieutenant Ram!
Lieutenant Ram!
Lieutenant Ram!
I'll have to call you back…yeah?
- Jai Hind, sir.
- At ease.
Over!
Any update about 312?
Their ration provision were over
four days ago, sir.
I just spoke to the Commanding Officer,
Vishnu Sharma.
There has been continuous snow fall
for the past fifteen days, sir.
All the roads are blocked.
It might take two days to identify
the approach road, sir.
Hmm. Okay.
Jai Hind, sir.
Ranjit, give me some hot water.
Sir, we can have it for today.
We are not sure of tomorrow.
We will run short of kerosene, sir.
Sir!
The snow has reduced.
Navin!
Connect me to Lieutenant Ram!
Tiger in… tiger in.
Charlie come in… Charlie come in.
Give me your exact location.
Tiger in… tiger in.
Charlie reporting, sir.
500 meters to the north east from base.
Can you see anyone coming from our unit?
No, sir. Negative.
No food for us even today.
Sorry, boys.
Tiger come in… tiger come in…
Tiger in.
Sir, there's a movement.
What?
Move forward… move forward.
Tell me exactly what you see.
Five civilians…four mules.
Terrorists?
There's a possibility, sir.
I don't think they are Mujahidin, sir.
How can you say that?
Sir, the yellow cloth tied
to the horse legs.
It's a Butta tradition, sir.
They pray in the Dargah and tie it, sir.
What if they are carrying weapons?
No, sir. Trust me.
They are definitely Kashmiri Muslims.
What if they open fire first?
I can't risk my soldiers' lives.
It's an order. Fire!
Fire!
Cease fire.
Come out.
Move.
Sir!
Ram was right.
These are Kashmiri Muslims.
It has been snowing
for the past fifteen days.
We thought you might have run out of food.
We got you food.
Sorry, sir.
I couldn't aim properly.
Bad weather.
I need a full, written explanation from you
by tomorrow morning, Ram.
Guns down!
- Forgive me, brother. I was mistaken.
- Sir…
Mistakes happen.
Please have your food.
Already, Vishnu sir can't stand you.
Jealous.
I wonder whether he will be satisfied with
your explanation or insists on punishment.
When I told him I was
sorry for the mistake…
He smiled and said that's okay and
asked me to have my food first.
Punishment is better rather than killing
such innocence and regret it life-long.
I can take it.
But it's not true that Vishnu sir
has some issue with me.
What is it then?
I don't know.
Sir!
We received news from Kashmir.
Our children have mingled with the locals
in the past six months.
They even got their ration cards, sir.
They are officially Kashmiris now.
Praise the lord.
Make sure Jameel gets the news
along with the picture.
What news?
That those four boys are Mujahidins.
Ask Jameel to tip the Indian Army.
I will begin the war after that.
But the Army will kill the boys!
That is the goal.
Greetings, sir.
Please inform Major Salwan
that Jameel has come.
With some important news.
Sir!
Greetings, sir!
Something important, Jameel?
Very important, sir.
Ansari…
Why this sudden meeting, sir?
Anything urgent?
Gentlemen! We have something
really important to discuss.
Please take your seats.
What happened, sir?
Four Mujahidin terrorists are living
like local citizens in Kashmir.
And this is over the past six months.
Sir, they are all minors.
Below 18 or 21 years.
Sorry for asking.
Is this information correct…
Who is the informer, sir?
Jameel.
But he is never wrong, Ram.
We don't know what their plans are.
But we know what we have to do.
Vishnu, I need to get
some of your best men.
Spread them into four teams and clean up.
Sir!
Who are your best men?
Arjun, Veeru, Vayu, Sharat, Gurvinder.
Thank you.
Alright. Good luck.
Sir!
Vishnu!
Fix this right.
What I fixed is a god damned bulb.
Is he Lord Vishnu not to feel jealous?
He is just Vishnu Sharma.
Hey, is Abbas home?
What do you want?
Hey, Iqbal!
Sir! This is the boy.
Hey, stop!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop!
Hey! Stop!
Stop!
Hey, stop!
Hey! No!
No, no, no!
Why are you shooting?
Bastard!
This is what Ansari wanted.
That's why he made the terrorists
cross the border.
He made us kill minors and
distanced us from the Kashmiris.
Something is going to happen.
To find out what,
we must catch hold of Jameel.
Outrage by the Indian Army officials killing
four minor boys in the Kashmir valley…
For the first time in response to-
- Find Jameel.
- Okay, sir.
Brother, how are you?
Give me two teas.
Do you know any Jameel here?
The army gets neither information
nor tea here.
Hey! What did you say?
Go away from here.
Otherwise, you will get stoned too.
Go away.
He went to such great lengths
to get us food yesterday.
Why this sudden change?
Sir! All streets are empty, sir.
- There is no one to tell us about Jameel.
- Not a soul here.
Sir, we couldn't find anything on Jameel.
It's looking like a curfew.
Where is everyone?
Something big is happening.
How long?
How long can we tolerate this?
Our women are being disgraced.
Whose is Kashmir?
It is ours, the Muslims.
Not these Hindus'.
Joining hands with the Indian Army,
these kafirs saw our children's blood.
They mercilessly killed them.
Right before our eyes.
It's time for jihad.
If you don't rise now,
Islam will be finished,
Do you want to see the end of Islam?
Is this what you want?
Revolt will start at Agarta.
Burn Agarta today.
Before the sun sets.
Say god is great.
God is great!
Say god is great!
God is great!
It will take the troupe four hours
to reach Agarta from the base.
- Nanda! Inform the troupes.
- Okay, sir.
We must stop this at Agarta.
They are too many.
We don't know
how many more will come to kill us.
- Let's inform everyone.
- No.
That's too dangerous. If they come to know
of the atrocity going to happen here,
Hindus and Muslims will be at daggers.
That shouldn't happen.
It's not like that.
No one should know anything.
We should evacuate the village first.
How do we do that without informing anyone?
I don't have a plan.
Tell me if you have one!
When the villagers heard
someone abducted a child,
they left Ram alone in Agarta
and chased after me.
Ram hid the remaining kids and elders
of Agarta in a safe house.
Stay safe.
But Ram had to save
not only the Hindus in Agarta,
but also the Muslims raging under Ansari.
Before we could come here,
the villagers got the news.
The village is empty.
Set the village on fire.
- Set fire!
- Set fire!
Abbas! Go that side.
- Set fire all around.
- Cover that side as well.
- I will set fire.
- Set the whole village on fire.
Everybody are inside.
You are joining hands
with the Hindus against us.
We won't spare you either.
We will kill you all.
- Kashir is ours.
- Set them all on fire.
Against whom?
Against whom?
Who told you this is victory?
Even if one life is lost here,
it's not you who wins.
Only Ansari.
I beg you.
Those kids were really mujahidin.
I fall at your feet.
Trust me.
Ansari's fight is not for you.
It's for Kashmir.
He is only using you.
Put him also in.
Jameel! Set fire!
Jameel!
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey!
Good that you came along with them.
Otherwise, the truth would never come out.
Tell them the truth.
No, no, no!
Don't set me ablaze. Please don't.
I will confess.
I will confess everything.
I will.
These five boys
should cross the border today.
Now, the…
One thousand.
Carry this information to the Indian Army.
A very important matter, sir.
Ansari's conspiracy to distance
the Indian Army from Muslims
- was burnt to ashes in those flames.
- Sir! I have made a mistake.
Please forgive me, sir.
Watching the Muslims
dousing the fire in Agarta,
the Hindus embraced them like brothers.
They lost as a religion
but won as humanity.
I understood then.
A man fighting with a weapon is a soldier.
A man warring for Dharma is Rama.
After the Agarta incident,
the entire nation looked up
to the soldiers as heroes.
So, Madam Vijayalakshmi came
to interview us from All India Radio.
You saved so many families.
But you are away from your own.
If you want to say something
to your family, please say it.
My daughter is just born.
They said she takes after me.
I believe I must name her
and repeat it thrice in her ear.
But I am still here.
Will you do it now?
Now?
Hey, Ram!
I need your help.
- What is it?
- Sit!
I need a nice name for my daughter.
Suggest one.
Amrutha?
It's good!
Amrutha.
Amrutha.
Amrutha.
Oh!
Woo!
Lieutenant Ram!
Hero of the Battalion!
Do you want to say something
to your family?
I have no one, madam.
I don't have anyone
outside of these barracks.
What?
I am a lone soldier.
Solo soldier.
Ram!
Coming.
Lieutenant Ram is a name
I heard only yesterday.
He is a lone soldier
guarding the hills of Kashmir.
Only yesterday I came to know
that he has no family to speak to.
Or at least someone to write a letter.
The country has Ram.
It is our responsibility to tell Ram
that he has us.
I wrote a letter to my son, Ram,
only yesterday.
Now, it's your turn.
Oh, Sir! One minute.
You have a letter.
Letter?
Yes. Lots of them.
For me?
Dear brother Ram!
I heard about you and
your story on the radio.
From now it's a lie to say you have no one.
Your niece celebrated her birthday
only last week.
I made 'Ariselu'.
I am planning the ear piercing for your
niece when you come down for vacation.
Hoping that you will come…
Please confirm through a letter.
Yours,
Your sister, Radhika.
Ram sat through the whole night
replying to those letters.
He didn't sleep.
He didn't let us sleep.
Sir!
I need two months of leave, sir.
Why do you need such long leave?
I want to meet my family, sir.
Okay.
What?
Waiting for Postman Bahadur?
- Yes. Three hours delay.
- Huh!
- He should be court-martialed.
- Oh!
Stop, stop, stop.
- Where are my letters?
- Sir.
My replies.
Send them fast.
One minute.
One minute.
Ariselu.
My sister sent me.
Dear Ram!
You have no one?
Where did you learn these lies?
You seem to have totally forgotten
you have a wife at home.
Wife?
Sitamahalakshmi...
You said 'I am right back' and left…
for the job.
Leaving me with my parents.
My family did warn me.
That this army guy wouldn't stay home.
Did I pay heed?
Hmm. I married you so I have to bear this.
Don't miss me.
Yours, Sitamahalakshmi.
What, Lord Rama?
How are you?
It's you.
You must be fine.
It's getting colder in the room here.
Are you sending it from Kashmir?
It was raining all through yesterday.
Seasons are also like you.
They come but they leave
without staying with me.
When will you come back, Ram?
Always in your thoughts,
Your wife, Sitamahalakshmi.
Your wife, Sitamahalakshmi.
There is no from address.
Sita!
Who are you?
“Kaveri gurgles in Kashmir valleys”
"Because of your letter"
“In these snowy mountains
green crops are raised by your words”
“The letters I read
planted a smile on my lips”
“In the cold, brazen winds
they are like summer flowers blooming”
“When will I see you?
Keeps asking this heart”
“My thoughts will send you
that day a warm welcome”
Ram!
Jai Hind, sir.
I heard you got married?
You didn't even tell me?
I didn't know either, sir!
At ease.
The girl's name?
Sitamahalakshmi, sir.
“When will I see you?
Keeps asking this heart”
“My thoughts will send you
that day a warm welcome”
“When will I see you?
Keeps asking this heart”
“My thoughts will send you
that day a warm welcome”
Hey, Vikas
Oye, Ram!
Do you know?
Along with me even our backyard
is missing you.
Plants stopped flowering.
Using this as a pretext,
butterflies are absconding.
Will you bring them for me while coming?
Bye.
Yours, Sitamahalakshmi.
“I don't know what I have done
to make you so fond of me”
“You consider me your own,
tell me what good have I done?”
Get lost!
“If only you let a hint to me”
“Running across the mountains
won't I come to you right now?”
Dear Ram!
Our neighbor lady asked me
how we first met.
'Ravana's annihilation
in the Kurukshetra war
and in the shimmer of the battle…
Sita's self-selection…'
When I told her this, she went away
smiling as if she understood.
No one can decipher this except you.
Ravana's annihilation
in the war of Kurukshetra?
And in the shimmer of the battle…
Sita's self-selection…'?
By the way, I had a dream last night.
You were in your sixties in the dream.
You were still roaming around me.
You kept calling 'Sita,
Sita' for everything.
And then it was morning.
When I looked beside me,
you were not there.
Bye! Your wife,
Sitamahalakshmi.
“When will I see you?
Keeps asking this heart”
“My thoughts will send you
that day a warm welcome”
“When will I see you?
Keeps asking this heart”
Jai Hind, sir.
“My thoughts will send you
that day a warm welcome”
Jai Hind, sir.
Jai Hind.
You have a letter.
What?
Yes, sir.
Dear Ram!
I am going to Hyderabad
on the 12th of this month.
When I was packing,
I found our wedding clothes.
She says wedding clothes!
Your shyness dressed in those clothes
is still fresh on my mind.
Hmm. 48 hours journey!
I never traveled so far all by myself.
But I will manage.
- After all I am…
- A lieutenant's wife.
There is a magic show by Austin
in Hyderabad this month.
If you were here,
you would have accompanied me. Bye.
Your wife Sitamahalakshmi.
There is no from address.
Delhi.
- Hey, Vikas!
- Huh?
I found Sita.
What?
Where?
On the Delhi train.
- When?
- On the 12th of this month.
- Come fast.
- Coming, coming.
They gave me only twenty days'
leave this time.
I have to meet so many.
Very short time.
- Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind.
Sir! How come you are here, sir?
Are you on vacation?
- On a mission.
- Oh!
A dangerous girl is
travelling on this train.
Hmm.
Is there a Sitamahalakshmi here?
So, there is no one.
- Find the TC.
- Yes, sir.
Do you have the girl's photo?
- No.
- Tsk!
How does she look?
That is the mission.
How do we identify her
without knowing anything?
I know.
Her name is Sitamahalakshmi.
We don't have names and horoscopes.
Only tickets.
Please don't say that.
- It's my future.
- Ah!
I mean… the future of many like me.
- It's in your hands, sir.
- How?
Hello!
You are not a T.C now.
You are also a part of this mission.
But such missions are new to me.
Don't worry.
- I am behind you.
- Hmm.
What is the plan?
- Train is yours and so is the plan.
- Hmm.
In that case, the four coaches behind
you connect to Madras Mail at Bhopal.
The 12 coaches behind me go to Hyderabad…
along with me.
Where is the dangerous girl going?
Hyderabad.
- Ask her.
- Hmm.
Ticket?
You look like goddess Lakshmi.
Is your name Sitamahalakshmi?
No. Parvati.
Damn!
Hmm.
This mission doesn't seem possible.
I have already covered eight coaches.
- May be the danger girl didn't board the train.
- Please don't say that.
Look at them.
All the passengers are sleeping
because of their trust in you.
- Hmm?
- Let's go.
- There are four coaches still left.
- Hmm.
Sleep.
It will ruin my reputation.
This is the last coach.
You shouldn't stay too long.
This is air conditioned.
It's a special coach.
Yes. Come in.
That is the last coupe.
Ticket?
Who is it?
“Ravana's annihilation
at the war of Kurukshetra'
'In the shimmer of the battle
is Sita's self-selection.'
Mr Ram?
My replies to your letters.
I didn't know where to send them.
So they remained with me.
We'll meet in the next station.
Sir, did you find the girl?
Is the mission a success?
No.
The real battle has just started,
Mr Varadhi.
Sir!
Is my train out of danger now?
No one can save your train or me.
Huh?
Ticket?
What is this?
You bought a ticket to Hyderabad
and boarded the Madras train?
What is this, brother?
- Madras?
- Huh?
The four coaches behind you connect
to Madras Mail at Bhopal.
Dear Sitamahalakshmi!
I am going to stay in your Bhaagyanagar…
no, no…
In my Sitanagar for a month.
Only for you.
I have my friend, Durjay,
in the lane next to Charminar.
He is a big dramatist.
It's a bit difficult to find him.
But I have to.
Because he has a telephone at home.
Number 37612.
I will be waiting for your call.
Yours, Ram.
Bharathi!
Scale!
You find fault with my scale?
I have four degrees in music.
Thermometer has lot more degrees.
How are the two connected?
In all fairness…
To beat you at irrelevant talk there is…
There is?
No one.
Don't praise me, Bharathi.
You are a precious gem combining
obscurity and innocence.
Enough of your flattery and
concentrate on your poem.
Yearning for the appearance
of Rama…Hanuman.
- Who is there?
- I am Ram.
Lord Srirama!
Rama!
Have you come down personally for me?
My life is blessed.
My life…
Sucks.
- Hey, you didn't expect me, did you?
- I don't know.
I came unannounced to surprise you.
Dangers and difficulties
never come announced.
They come unannounced.
What problem have you brought with you now?
- Where is the phone?
- Over there.
'Hail, Lord Shiva”
What is this hygiene and cleanliness, Rama?
- Hey, Durjaya!
- Hmm.
That phone stopped working a week ago.
When do you bother to get it repaired?
The phone stopped working only a week ago.
Our government stopped
working six weeks ago.
I gave them a complaint.
I am sick of your lies every day.
Poor grandma.
Hey! Do you realize
how you have betrayed me?
I didn't know till now telling lies
is such a big betrayal, soldier.
I can't see Sita again.
I don't even know her address.
You have destroyed my only chance.
Sita?
Hi. I am Ram's friend, Vikas Varma.
Who is Sita, Varma?
That's a big story, Durjaya Sharma.
Is there no summary?
Okay.
Is anyone home?
Why not?
What is this?
Why isn't your phone working?
Have you come to repair it?
Without a complaint?
Please, come.
Stupid phone.
It's been a big issue
with grandma for ten days.
- And since morning…
- Can you call Ram?
Sita?
Hmm.
Those days Rama went to find Sita.
Sita has come looking for Ram.
This is Kaliyug.
Let me call him.
Lord Srirama?
What is it?
Mother Sita is here.
You stepped into my
life for the first time.
What will you have?
For a few words in a letter,
how did you leave Kashmir
to snow and come here?
Lots of letters stating
you are born for me.
Rain of letters in Kashmir.
I had to come.
Sorry, madam.
I took your picture
without your permission.
The phone wasn't working.
I was literally doing penance to meet you.
And you appeared before me…
like an angel.
Do you know something?
I know your letters by heart.
I read them over a few hundred times.
When read them it feels as if
we are married for so very long… - What?
I mean…
It feels like we know each other
for a very long time.
Same way,
consider them casual scribbles
since I was confident I'll never meet you.
I actually came to tell you this.
That's a lie.
Why would you come looking for the address
just to say this?
You came to meet me.
Admit it.
I got to go.
Ms Sita! Just a minute.
Even the rain asks you not to go.
It's time for my dance class.
Ms Sita!
I used to get wet in snow alone.
It is unfair to bring me so far
and drench me in rain!
So sad.
Tell me your travel expenses.
I will pay you.
Dear Sitamahalakshmi!
The rain that came looking for you, and I…
To walk away from us both without
getting wet with you at least for a while,
makes my breath
evaporate even in this rain.
Only you can burn away the distance
that's going to kill me.
Truly, Yours Ram.
If you give me the address,
I will post it.
To give the address to danger and
invite it home, is not very wise, Mr Ram.
Bye.
Truly, Yours, Sitamahalakshmi.
He was so happy he met Sita
that he brought the roof down.
Ram who had no one in his life,
had a storm in the form of Sita.
One letter…
It united Ram somewhere from Kashmir and
Sitamahalakshmi working in the Nizam's palace…
What a terrific love story!
Didn't you meet Ram again?
No.
The situation at home didn't allow me
to go back to the army.
There was no response
after sending many letters to Ram.
Afreen, are you alright?
No, sir.
Unless I meet Sitamahalakshmi,
my problem won't be solved.
Ram's friend Durjay Sharma
may know about Sita.
I have his address.
Let me check.
Sir, he is…?
Vishnu Sharma.
We were all in the same battalion.
Would he know about Sita?
I don't think so.
I have no other way.
I will try my luck.
Do you have his contact number?
Vishnu, sir!
Vishnu, sir!
No, sir!
Are you mad?
Ram, don't go!
Listen to me, sir!
Oh!
Everyone's here?
At ease, gentlemen.
I will miss you too.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hello!
Hi, I am Afreen.
I would like to speak to
Brigadier Vishnu Sharma.
About what?
It's a long story, sir.
I want to talk to him about one
It. Ram who worked with him 20 years ago.
Sir!
You got a call, sir.
Call? Who is it?
Some Afreen, sir.
She wants to know about It Ram
who worked with you in Kashmir in 1964.
Ram?
I'll get it for you, sir.
Wait.
Hey, wait, man.
I am coming. Wait.
How long?
Bus… the bus is leaving.
Come fast.
Hello!
Ajay, contact the intelligence
services immediately.
Who is she?
Where is she?
Where did she come from?
Whom did she meet?
As soon as possible,
I want every single detail.
Immediately.
Sir.
Did you find anything?
Sir, her name is Afreen.
From the army base at Hyderabad,
she took the details of a Retired Second
It. Vikas Sharma who lives in Anantpur.
Vikas?
Yes, sir!
Vikas, gave your contact.
Sir, you have to catch the
7am flight to Delhi, sir.
Sir, what happened?
- Any change in the plan, sir?
- Yes.
I am going to Anantapur.
Dad!
Dad!
Come on, my son.
Bhimasena!
What is the news?
Someone has come, dad.
In the middle of the day…
Without invitation or permission…
Let them enter!
Please come. Please.
Please, come.
Pakistan agrees to
cease fire at the border.
I hope they mean it.
Lord Rama!
'Search for Sita with you'
chapter has officially closed in my life.
If you can kindly make an exit,
you will help me find salvation.
Other than praying
that you should find Sita,
I can't do any physical task, Lord.
There is a magic show by Austin
in Hyderabad this month.
If you were here,
you would have accompanied me.
Yours, a common unfortunate man.
Got you!
Who?
It struck me.
What?
- Let's go.
- Where?
To the magic show.
We have been looking for Sita
for a week now.
If we don't find her even here,
you might as well give up.
- We will definitely find her.
- Where?
She will be somewhere around.
May I ask the beautiful lady
to come on to the stage, please?
Go.
May I know your name, young lady?
Sitamahalakshmi.
Ms Sita! You are quite popular here!
Come, come.
Let's start the show.
Ram!
This way.
- Hi.
- Hi!
Sir. Excuse me.
Just one minute.
How do you know my name?
You only read the letters sent to you.
There are many unsent ones.
I was happily living like an orphan.
I was not only troubled with letters
but I was offered travel expenses.
Is that fair?
When you suddenly appear like a storm,
what can anyone do?
If I don't show off at least that much,
won't you take her for granted?
Why did you stop?
Please, go on.
What should I tell you?
Story.
The story of the moon.
Miss Sita, can you please
put your rose in the jar?
Sure.
Thank you!
Abracadabra… abracadabra…
Can anyone from the audience
come on to the stage, please?
Can you remove the cloth, please?
Sure.
You asked me to bring something
in your letter.
Butterflies.
I got them.
I got to know the truth about you.
I wonder what truth?
I guess you are a dance teacher?
Ms Sita!
Don't worry about your flower.
I'll send it to your home.
And your address, please?
Sitamahalakshmi
Noorjahan Palace
Afzalgunj
Hyderabad!
We'll move to the next act.
Hello! One minute.
Look.
Probably you are thinking of a visit
since you know the address.
Don't venture to.
Ms Sitamahalakshmi!
This is not at all fair.
-I worked very hard and-
-There you go.
Started again!
But… why should we meet? Huh?
Start again!
Dear Sitamahalakshmi,
It is very uncomfortable
to be formal with you.
- Hey, Sita!
- Huh?
That or just hey, you…
We must meet frequently so I can
get familiar enough to call you so!
If my brother questions me,
what should I tell him?
Tell him the truth.
Tell him the truth
that you are with me.
If I tell him the truth,
my brother won't accept it.
You are too much.
When such beauty tells a lie,
Truth.
How can truth not believe it?
“Has such great beauty taken a diversion
and somehow reached this earth?”
“Or could they have chiseled it?
A great sculpture into your form?”
“You are a magnificence
that world has not seen”
“My waiting is blessed
touched by your laughter”
“Are you the mist that nights bow out to?”
“An annoyed moon left at once
asking why him when you are around”
“A billion stars descended on earth
to find what gave you such soft light”
“Your touch makes the earth swell,
how strange”
“I am pulled into no return zone
by your boldness”
"Your sari cascading is its natural trait"
"Crouching like a tiger is the youth"
“My world surrenders
and it's thanks to you”
“An annoyed moon left at once
asking why him when you are around”
“A billion stars descended on earth
to find what gave you such soft light”
Ah!
A boy and a girl in
the middle of the night!
What times!
Disastrous times.
- At least they are maintaining distance.
- Ah…
If they come close?
Won't the world stand still?
Oye! Stop there.
I touched him.
Has your world stopped?
Ask him.
Mr Ram!
Has your world stopped?
No.
You can go now.
So, it didn't stop.
Let's go.
Let's go, Mr Ram.
“Did a parrot dress in sari, surrounded
you and turned into butterflies?”
“Shall I stretch my bow, tie the knot
with you and become Rama again?”
“Is beauty a slave at your abode?
A war is declared against you by the world”
Ms Sita! It's you!
“My world surrenders
and it's thanks to you”
“An annoyed moon left at once
asking why him when you are around”
“A billion stars descended on earth
to find what gave you such soft light”
The rain is not going to stop.
They have a place to rent. Come.
Come, come.
You will get wet.
- I saw the to-let board.
- Oh, that!
Grandma! Someone is here to see the house.
I will be right back.
What?
In this heavy rain?
Are they family?
Er… er…
Coming week…
We are getting married coming week.
Huh?
Right?
Right?
- What, girl?
- Huh?
Is it true?
Hmm.
There.
You have just consented.
Grandma! You are the witness.
For what?
That… er… I am saying you are a witness
to our wedding.
Am I right, Ms Sita?
What's wrong with you?
You are getting married in a week
and why are you so formal with her?
You must address her as Sita or hey.
Well said.
Stop it, grandma.
She is always like this.
Come on, sister.
Hey! Sita!
Open the door on the right.
That's the hall.
Yes, I have seen it.
It's really beautiful.
Sister!
- Yours is a love marriage, right?
- Yes!
How did you know?
You are looking for a house together
before you got married.
Can't I understand?
I only read about lovers.
Never saw them till now, sister!
Where did you meet the first time?
On the train.
No.
In Kashmir.
Kashmir?
Wow! Such a beautiful place, sister!
Snowy mountains all around,
apples, snowfall…
Tall pine trees.
Kurukshetra all around.
Is it a festival today?
Veneration!
We believe that
when the first snow of the year falls,
Lord Sriram and Mother Sita
come to Agarta to spend time.
Really?
Where are you from?
Hyderabad!
Fire surrounded Agarta that was waiting
for the arrival of Sriram and Sita.
I never imagined
I would get out alive that day.
Just then, I saw Rama.
Hey!
A girl ran in this direction.
Did you see her?
Come along.
Is anyone here?
There is no one.
Then, who is this?
She is my wife.
Your wife is very pretty.
I am a Muslim too.
What difference does it make?
We are only concerned about this beauty.
Sorry, madam.
I told them you are my wife
only to save you.
'Ravana's annihilation in Kurukshetra.'
'In the shimmer of war,
Sita's self-selection.'
I get it now, Sita.
Sita!
So elusive!
Why are you so late?
What were you doing?
This is my first attempt at stealing.
That's why I am late.
So this is…?
Surprise.
What happened?
Are you feeling cold?
When danger is a few feet away,
you don't feel cold.
You panic.
Why fear? I am here.
Precisely why I am scared.
We are going to the palace tomorrow.
For what?
My funeral?
To confirm the marriage alliance.
I don't want get married right now.
I was talking about my wedding.
So, you won't leave me alone
in the near future?
Even devices are making fun of me.
This is what they call the ways of destiny.
It's not so easy to go to the palace
as she comes here for you.
Our Telugu teacher Mr Krishnamurthi stayed
somewhere around here, didn't he?
Doesn't it sound irrelevant to you,
what you just said?
If something goes wrong, they will kill us.
Hey!
We used to play foot ball here.
Do you remember?
It's strange Mughal-e-Azam is playing now.
What did I ask you?
What are you telling me?
How do we enter the palace?
If you stop the car.
I did.
Will the palace come?
There.
Subramanyam.
He will take us inside personally.
So, you planned the strategy much earlier.
Courage and bravery
get you Sitamahalakshmi.
Hail Hanuman!
- One rupee…
- Mr Subramanyam!
Are you good?
How are you?
What's wrong with me?
I am fine.
Who are you?
I am Ram.
I met you in the palace last Friday?
Friday?
You forgot me, sir.
Ah… it's not like that.
Just now…
I vaguely remember.
- Ram!
- Yes!
- Where to? To the palace?
- Of course.
Let's go. I am going to the palace too.
Why do you take the trouble?
I will bargain and go for a rupee.
- You move!
- Oho! Come on, sir.
Let's go in my car.
You think so, Ram?
Bah, come on, sir.
“Walk to me with your regal gait,
my handsome Rama”
The law says what the king pleases.
Why talk about it law now?
Just a proverb.
“Across hills and cascading streams
come to me, I implore you”
“Walk to me with your regal gait,
my handsome Rama”
“Pensively I wait in Mithila”
That's why she even appointed a teacher
to learn from.
“Begin your journey,
my blue skinned Krishna”
“Walk to me with your regal gait,
my handsome Rama”
Stop, stop! Who are you?
- Why are you coming up the steps this side?
- Sorry, sir.
-I told him not to but he-
-Sir! He is Mr Subrmanyam's nephew.
Is it?
Greet him.
Wow!
What courtesy!
What decency!
You are a shade darker
but you look just like your uncle.
I am Sitaramaiah.
I am your uncle's friend.
Then bless me.
Okay, okay. Get up.
“Across hills and cascading streams
come to me, I implore you”
Stop.
Stop!
What are you doing here?
Are you looking for someone?
I came here for Sita, sir.
Sita? Who is Sita…
For Sita…Ramaiah.
He is Mr Sitaramaiah's nephew.
- Yeah!
- You do it now. I did my turn downstairs.
Is it?
Oh, enough. Enough.
This idiot never told me
he has a nephew of marriageable age!
- He doesn't know it himself.
- Huh?
You could have told me.
I just came to know, sir.
Have you noticed something?
Even you came to know only now.
Joke, sir.
Joke!
What, Subbu!
You have managed so long quite well
without talking about your nephew.
Oh, really!
This is Ram.
Hey, move!
- My nephew.
- I know!
This is Sitaramaiah…
Here, here.
Is like your uncle, right?
Hey, you didn't stop acting funny
even at this age!
Why should I?
Why?
I feel stifled between these
blood relations and adult talks.
I will wait at the car, okay?
- I'll give this to Sita and be back.
- Okay, okay.
Stop laughing a bit.
“Pensively I wait in Mithila”
Hear my prayer
and come to me Rama!”
“Make a bow of your flute
and sing the song of Sita”
Please go and learn dance from Sita.
What are you doing here?
How dangerous it is if someone sees us?
Only now I realize
how beautiful danger can be, Sita.
You… shouldn't come here.
Shh… I believe you shouldn't come here.
Tell me why you had to take such great risk
and come here.
Teaching dance to the princess
is quite a big job.
I have a small job to offer.
In case you want to take it up,
if you like it…
What job is it?
All these years I don't have a house of
my own or people I can call mine, Sita.
Every vacation, I pack my bags,
roam the country and
go back to the army base.
But… it's not like that from now.
When I get a vacation,
I must come to you.
As you keep waiting for me,
I must take you close like this.
I want to make true
the lie I spoke in Kashmir.
I don't know
whether this job is big or small.
If you like it, let me know.
I will treat you like a queen.
Truly.
Tell me your problem, Sita!
I am a soldier!
Hey, how can she walk away like that?
Can she find another guy Ram?
After he bent backwards to save her,
she must feel some gratitude, right?
Anyway, you girls are all the same.
You keep calling us gentlemen.
But you will end up
marrying some rogue finally.
Was it the same thing even in 1964?
She must have some reason?
There should be, right?
Tell him and then go away.
I asked Ram the same question.
What did he say?
Go far.
Go away.
Come near.
Why would they say love is blind
for no reason?
Have you never met Ram after that?
- Come closer.
- Hey, that's bad.
No one knows when he comes or goes.
It's twenty years since I saw him.
This is so irritating.
- We don't know who Sita is.
- Don't!
- We don't know how she looks.
- Don't!
I have only ten days left.
How to find Sita?
One minute.
Ram took a picture of her.
I think it is with me somewhere.
This is my aunt.
This is my mom.
This is stage actor, Duryodhana.
- Here is Sita!
- Huh!
She looks kick ass.
But she is quite beautiful, isn't she?
Can I take this photograph? Please!
Hmm.
Thank you.
- Are you doing math?
- No.
Then go.
What do you want to do with the photo?
If we show this photo to Subramamyam and
ask for dance teacher, Sita, he'll know.
Come on, come on.
Sorry, sorry.
- Balaji!
- Huh?
- Balaji!
- What happened again?
What is it?
Is Sitamahalakshmi… Princess Noorjahan…
Tell me your problem once, Sita.
I am a soldier.
Jai Hind, sir.
Four days ago a girl came to see you.
Her name…
It's Afreen, sir.
She is from London.
From Pakistan.
She is Pakistani Army Major Abu Tariq's
grand daughter.
She said she was writing some book
and asked me about Ram, sir.
I am really sorry, sir.
I honestly didn't know all this.
You don't.
You don't know where she came from.
Do you at least know where she stays?
She gave me an address to let her know
if I find something about Ram, sir.
I will go get it right now.
How is it possible, dude?
A Nizam princess writes a letter to
a soldier in Kashmir!
He lands here holding the letter!
What a love story!
I wonder how a princess fell in love
with a common soldier!
Noorjahan is not so naive.
She was London returned.
When he proposed to her, she simply left.
Hello!
Everyone is not like you.
When you come across someone like Ram,
no one will say no.
How is Ram special?
Other than loving a rich girl?
That too a princess!
Hey!
Ram had no idea Sita was a princess.
How could he not know?
Even the people we met had no idea
Sitamahalakshmi and Nurjahan are one.
Hundred percent there is a chance.
May be!
But I didn't come here
to solve Ram's problem.
I am trying to solve my own problem.
Shall we go?
Don't take me for a selfish person.
Okay?
We are already doing
a lot for some strangers.
You won't change.
All these years I don't have a house of
my own or people I can call mine, Sita.
Every vacation, I pack my bags, roam
the country and go back to the army base.
But… it's not like that from now.
When I get a vacation,
I must come to you.
As you keep waiting for me,
I must take you close like this.
I want to make true
the lie I told in Kashmir.
I don't know
whether this job is big or small.
If you like it, let me know.
I will treat you like a queen.
Good morning, Your Highness.
Good morning.
Today's schedule is going to be hectic,
Madam Princess.
Please get ready immediately.
Ma'am, your meeting with
the Education Minister is at one.
Miss Rekha will be joining you.
And you have a meeting with
welfare community too, Madam Princess.
Hello!
How are you?
Good morning.
This is the first pass out batch
from the girls' education program.
- Waiting for a picture with you, ma'am.
- Hmm.
You are welcome, my cuteness!
Your Highness!
You are not allowed to kneel down
in front of the common people.
Who is going to stop me, Fatima!
Okay!
Oh, god!
If you ask her to marry you without knowing
anything about you-
Why won't she run away?
What doesn't she know about me?
She knows everything.
You know how to obliterate an enemy.
But you have absolutely no idea
of a girl's heart.
You are Ram.
You work for the Army.
You don't call this information.
Can he buy me a sari for a festival?
How much does he make a month?
In short, what is my future
if I marry this guy?
Something like that.
This is not Tretayuga
to follow Rama with nothing.
Oh!
I have 12,000 in my bank account.
I get a hundred rupee raise next month.
Six hundred per month!
Six hundred per month is extraordinary!
Go and tell Sita.
When you tell her, she will be too eager
to give you her consent.
I am fortunate to have a great friend
like you, Ravana.
Thank you. Same to you.
Tell Mother Sita I asked after her, Rama.
You have changed the entire Ramayana.
Come. Let's go.
I am coming. Go ahead.
Ram proposed to me.
Once we are married-
Did he say he will treat you like a queen?
Of course, he will.
Noor!
This is not something we can discuss
sitting in a car laughing about it.
Be practical.
The more you delay,
the more hurt he will be.
Tell him the truth.
If ever truth has to be told,
I must first tell him I
am in love with him.
Sita is a dream.
You are Princess Noorjahan.
Please, wake up.
I don't want to.
There's not a moment I don't wish
I am not who I am.
You know that's not going to happen.
That's why you walked away
as soon as he proposed to you.
Noor! Why are you feeling guilty?
You didn't write the source address.
Yet, he came looking for you.
That's his fault.
I made the mistake of writing to him.
He would have been happier as an orphan.
Is there a problem, Your Highness?
There is a very big problem, Mr Javed.
Can you solve it?
You can't. Right?
Let's go.
Noor, you are playing with fire.
You know about your brother.
You have no other choice.
The future of your dynasty
depends on your decision.
Have you forgotten?
Hey! Sita!
Your Highness!
It's an emergency.
Everybody is waiting for you.
Your Highness!
Due to the financial crisis in Oman,
the Sultan of Oman
took control of all the industries.
Including our cash deposits,
properties and assets.
Things are looking dark.
Farzana!
Why are you crying? Hmm?
Sultan of Oman has
taken over our industries.
We have lost 60 crores overnight.
What?
There is only one way to get out of this.
If the Sultan of Oman agrees to it.
Sultan and his family alone
can control the businesses in Oman.
There is only one thing we can do.
To enter into an alliance with them.
If the Oman's Sultan had a daughter,
we would have proposed your name.
But he has only a son.
You are thinking right, sir.
If you can propose your sister's marriage
with the Prince of Oman,
We can be saved.
If Prince of Oman approves of it.
Your Highness,
only you can bring some light
into this darkness.
Send the proposal.
If God wills it.
Appu! Please, wait.
Don't shout.
Who is it?
Mr Subramanya has sent me.
It's Afreen, right?
He told me.
I am about to go to college.
I have a lecture.
- Shall we talk on the way?
- Hmm.
What do you want to know about Noorjahan?
Er.. She is writing a book, actually.
Oh!
I have to deliver this letter to Sita.
Sita-Ram!
It's been twenty years
since I heard the names.
What a day!
Why did Noorjahan fall in love
with a normal soldier?
That too a Hindu.
But, why?
Because, he is Ram.
Sir! Wait! Stop!
Sir, you can't go in.
I want to meet someone else.
Sir, you can't go in.
Princess is inside.
Who is bothered about your princess?
I have come to meet my princess.
I was told at the palace, she came here.
- Sita! Sita!
- Please don't shout.
- Mr Vishwanadh! Can you please excuse us?
- And clear the room also.
Sita!
Sir, there is no one by the name, Sita.
Sir, Princess is inside. Please don't go.
Ram is here.
- Tell him this is not going to happen.
- You can't go!
- Let him lead his life, Noor.
- Please!
- I will go and meet her once.
- Security!
- Let go of sir.
- I have to talk, please!
Madam is calling you.
I am an idiot.
Why would a girl consent to marriage
as soon as she is asked?
When you left in silence yesterday,
I felt I was making a mistake.
I made the mistake by writing to you.
How is that?
You wrote to me out of empathy
because I saved you.
It was I who overstepped
talking about love and wedding.
Isn't it?
- Tell me.
- No!
Thank god.
I am relieved.
So you were not uncomfortable?
How can you say yes
without knowing anything about me?
Especially, you are Sita.
How beautiful you look
even without vermilion?
Like Madam Savitri in 'Miss a mm a'…
And, though in love, girls are also worried
as to how they will be looked after in future.
You don't have to worry.
I give you my word.
My salary is 600 rupees per month.
I will put it all in your hands.
My P.F is thirty rupees.
Annual increment is 20 rupees.
Trust me I have 12,000 in my account.
We can even buy a big house with that.
I will keep you as happy as you are now.
In case I die in war, up to 40,000 rupees-
Can you please stop it, Ram?
Why are you telling me all this?
Though I have been waiting for the day
I'll give you my answer…
My difficult situation right now
doesn't allow me to do that.
Why don't you tell me
what your problem is?
I am a soldier.
You need time, right?
Take all the time you want.
To take this short journey with you,
I will wait life-long.
Where to?
To Kashmir?
Four days are still left to go to Kashmir.
For now, I wanted to introduce you
to my family members I am yet to meet.
But you need some time.
It's time for the train.
Noor! Where to?
Ram is going away to Kashmir in four days.
- I can't see him again.
- Hey, what are you talking?
Everybody is waiting for you there.
I must go at least to tell him the truth.
- Please manage.
- Noor!
“Oh, Sita, I will be your companion”
“I will be your day and night shadow”
"The lines on the palm play the guide"
"I shall walk never leaving your hand"
“Destiny has defined the shore”
“I shall become your life-long partner”
“I shall be the dream
That ripples like a sparkle in the eye”
"Hi, Rama, are we made for each other?"
"Will we walk step in step with time?"
"Can we write what will happen tomorrow?"
"Be the pen that writes it"
"Can we paint life together?"
"Show me the brush."
'Thunder hides in lightning
Watch out, dear”
"Oh, Sita, I will be your companion"
"Hi, Rama, are we made for each other?"
“Ask me in my sleep and
I say nothing but your name”
“You know it's a life time job
and yet you tarry”
"A sweet pain that was never before"
"The moment is here to be a yes man"
“Time, be kind to me
Join us how dreams and sleep do”
“Let me work for the man I worship
show me your miracle”
'Deergha Sumangali Bhava'
Aunty!
What is meant by 'Deergha Sumangali Bhava'?
Blessing given to stay
with husband and kids forever.
Oh, it means that!
Did you hear?
Where does Radhika live?
Upstairs.
Upstairs.
Sister Radhika!
A letter from your brother, Ram.
The sweets you sent were very delicious.
My niece…
How is my niece?
I am coming to Warangal
next month to see you.
- Your uncle is coming to see you!
- Radhika!
Shh! Softly.
She wakes up when she hears a voice
other than mine.
Is this the first time you came to me
or were you here before?
If you called me by name,
you must have come earlier.
Please don't think otherwise.
I have poor memory for faces.
This is not a job done out of love.
And then people come here
only in the dark.
Isn't it, dear?
How long do you want to stay?
I got a letter saying I have a sister
and she has a daughter.
But…
You never wrote how you were.
Brother!
You have really come!
How are you, brother?
I just can't believe this.
Is she my sister-in-law?
She is so beautiful.
One minute, brother.
Brother!
Your niece, Kasturi.
I put her to sleep
reading your letters, brother.
Will you stay till tomorrow, brother?
Let's get her ears pierced.
I mean… if you like to…
Rotten lives, brother.
Don't take pity.
I got used to it.
I have to raise her.
It's dark in here.
Kasturi should grow up in light.
Come.
Come on!
- Okay, sister.
- Kasturi!
Radhika! Where are you going?
I am taking her.
You must be back before evening.
Do you understand?
Brother! Brother, no. Let it be.
She won't come back ever.
We live on every day struggle.
Don't take away our source.
We paid a lot for her.
How many in all?
Ram spent all the money and
gave everyone there a new life.
Take care of Kasturi.
Don't worry about her.
She is my responsibility from now.
Take care.
Ram!
What happened?
Are you okay with a rented house?
Rented house?
The money in my account is run out.
How can we buy a house now?
Are you going to Kashmir tomorrow?
Hmm.
When will I see you again?
Tomorrow night at ten.
My train is scheduled then.
You will come, right?
I will be waiting.
Sita wanted to tell Ram
she could never be with him.
Instead, she got so close
she couldn't move away from him.
At that moment…
The storm that originated in Oman
stepped into the palace.
Yeah. I'll take care.
I'll speak to you later.
Hello, Ambassador.
Welcome.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Is there any good news, Mr Akbar?
Sorry to say this, Your Highness.
But we have instructions to tell this
directly to Princess Noorjahan.
Okay. Come.
I hope he brought the good news.
Your brother didn't sleep
through the whole night.
Neither did I.
Look at you!
How can he say no to you?
He must have definitely consented.
That's what I am worried about.
Noorjahan!
Oman Ambassador is here.
He wants to meet you.
Come.
Mr Akbar…
Princess Noorjahan.
Not only Prince,
all Oman is waiting for you, Your Highness.
“Whom do I ask what transpired?”
“Don't I know there will be no answer?”
“The heart knows you are my life”
“It won't believe that you will not return”
“Time does not help
and the gashes of love don't heal”
“This is not at all fair
that distance surrounds me”
- “Are these unforgivable moments?”
- I'm so happy.
We are saved.
Oman Prince has accepted our proposal.
He sent an official letter!
“You are Rama that the world loves”
“But Sita is not by your side”
“Excruciating is your pain”
- “If only it were a dream!”
- Sir! How is Sitamahalaksmi madam?
Soldiers!
Attention!
Can I speak to Sitamahalakshmi?
Ram! Can I call you later?
- Sir, we may not find him here.
- Sir!
Shall we go?
“Against an invisible enemy…”
“… who cannot unsheathe the sword”
“How is a war possible?”
“Your calling me 'Ram' cuts at my heart”
“It is killing me to think
that there is no return”
“Are these unforgivable moments?”
Did Ram know Sitamahalakshmi
was Princess Noorjahan?
No.
Strange that financial crisis in Oman
led to Ram and Sita's separation!
Who said they were separated?
Did they meet?
How?
Love may be blind.
But the people around are not.
Mr Sanyasirao!
Do you ever consider a raise in my salary?
What is it?
Salary, sir.
Salary…
You mean salary?
Ah… that's it!
Marthandam…
You know when it comes to expenditure,
I am hard on hearing.
I thought so.
What news?
Hmm.
Photographs that can raise your
paper circulation as well as my salary.
Who is she?
Princess Noorjahan…
Who is this guy with her?
He is a nobody.
A nobody?
He is just a common man!
Princess Noorhajan is in love
with a nobody?
Marthanadam!
This is what you call news!
Print it.
Princess Noorjahan in love
with a common man!
Rubbish!
It's fake news.
In tomorrow's newspaper
there will be an article…
The Prince of Oman
is getting married to Noorjahan.
Do you mean it's not true?
Of course it's not true!
Can we hear the same from the Princess?
I have to explain to Sultan.
Of course!
Come with me.
Noor!
Noor…
Did you see the news, Noor?
Princess Noorjahan in love
with a common man!
Huh?
Noor!
Hey!
I'll take care of it, okay?
I will take care of it.
He wants to hear you say this is a lie.
Tell him the truth, Noor.
Tell him it's a lie, Noor.
You know how important this wedding is.
A small slip and we lose everything, Noor.
Say it's a lie, Noor.
Please!
I am sorry, Mr Akbar.
This is the truth.
Please convey my sincere apologies
to your Prince.
I am in love with a commoner.
Sure, Your Highness.
With your permission-
I am sorry.
I should have told you this before.
Are you in your senses?
He is the Prince of Oman, Noorjahan.
Who is that guy?
Who is that common man?
Noor!
Hello!
Can I speak to Ms Sitamahalakshmi?
Ram, tell me.
I was just telling them about you.
And you called up.
Ram?
Ram, can I call you later?
Who is this, Ram?
Lieutenant Ram.
Indian Army.
Indian Army?
- Have you gone mad?
- Yes, I am mad.
Noor!
I am sorry.
If it is only money that you lose
because of my wedding with Ram,
you can take my entire property.
You have really gone crazy.
What are you saying? Huh?
I am not worried about wealth.
I am worried about you!
And our family's hon our.
Noor!
Do you realize what you are giving up
and for whom?
If you know the kind of person
I am doing this for,
you won't speak like this.
-You will be glad-
-How can you do this, Noor?
If you have any problem,
you can call me Sita.
Fatima, make immediate arrangements
to catch the flight to Srinagar.
And do not forget to thank the reporter.
He has done me a great service.
Parade! Rest!
Parade! Attention!
Sir!
Someone has come to meet you.
I resigned my job there,
to do job with you.
I'm no more an orphan, right?
“What does the prospective wedding say?”
“Bride's selection of groom is beautiful”
“How would the prospective glory be?”
“Every moment filled with beauty”
“This is a knot that can't be untied”
“This is a story that will never end”
“For generations”
“As a timeless song”
“With every pair bearing witness”
“Reigning over love”
“As the dreams in eyes
in forms of art indelible”
“spread before the eyes”
As the dreams in eyes
in forms of art indelible”
“spread before the eyes”
“There is no one around”
“They are full of envy”
“But we need some of our own”
“We have our four directions”
“Won't we have a band?”
“Isn't the music in heart enough?”
“Who will officiate our wedding?”
“Our own hearts”
“Hearts? Okay”
“As the dreams in eyes
in forms of art indelible”
“spread before the eyes”
“As the dreams in eyes
in forms of art indelible”
“spread before the eyes”
“Isn't this the right moment?”
“The heart knows everything”
“What follows next?”
“That depends on your lead”
“What is this strange inhibition?”
“Because a girl goes by tradition”
“Behind the lips that don't speak”
“Sense the beckoning of my heart”
“Fine then”
“As the dreams in eyes
in forms of art indelible”
“spread before the eyes”
People like Sita are found only in epics.
You don't find them in real world.
She is epic.
No discussion.
If things went as planned,
you wouldn't come looking for me.
The real problems surfaced then.
Ma'am! It's time for the conference.
They are waiting.
Hmm. I am coming.
Do you know where Noorjahan is now?
London.
Hello, Radhika speaking.
Hello, can I speak to Princess Noorjahan?
Uh, she has gone to Kashmir.
She goes to Kashmir
every year around this time.
Kashmir?
Uh... can you give me her address?
The girl left at eight, sir.
Abu Tariq!
Afreen has left from Hyderabad.
We don't know where she is.
By the time I reach Delhi tomorrow,
I should know her whereabouts.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I was delayed.
But excited to see Sita?
No?
- Thank you!
- Thanks.
- Balaji!
- Hmm.
Mind blowing love story, isn't it?
Wait.
- Are you Afreen?
- Yes, sir!
Passport, please.
Excuse me, sir!
What are you doing?
We are taking you into custody.
But... but for what reason, sir?
Don't make any scene.
Come with us.
Afreen!
Afreen!
Hey! Stop!
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop! Stop!
I am with her.
Take me along.
I slogged like a dog.
But you are going with a convoy!
Coming from Pakistan,
why are you looking for Ram?
Do you know Ram?
Tell me!
I know he works for the Indian Army.
He is a traitor! A betray or!
Because of him we lost 32 lives
in Operation Grand slam!
What's happening?
Speak out!
What do you know about Ram?
Jai Hind, sir.
At ease.
What's going on here?
Sir, she is from Pakistan.
And she is searching for
Lieutenant Ram in India.
Major, I know about her quite well.
She is not a spy.
And she is no threat to us.
I need to speak to her alone.
I will explain to you later.
Thank you.
Sir! I will wait outside.
I have nothing to do with Ram.
I didn't know he was a traitor.
He is not a traitor!
Don't say that again.
I don't have to tell you what happened.
But I am indebted to Ram
and your grandpa Abu Tariq.
How do you know my grandfather?
Order please, sir!
Is there something vegetarian?
Hey, careful.
- Get me that!
- Okay, sir!
Vishnu sir!
Ram, right?
- Hi, sir.
- Hi, ma'am.
- Hi.
- I am Ram.
- She is Sita.
- Hello.
I know.
You finally found your Sita.
You proved to be a soldier.
Ma'am! The table over there is free.
Okay. Let's go.
Sit here.
Sure, ma'am.
Sit down.
Ma'am! How did you know about us?
Does Vishnu sir discuss me at home?
Vishnu is not quick to appreciate.
But you are an exception.
He likes you.
Did your familiy consent to your wedding?
No. They are against it.
Then run away without their knowledge
and get married just like us.
- Yours was a love marriage?
- Yes!
He took me to Gurudutt's movie
showing two tickets and married me.
He didn't even tell me!
Mom! He didn't even tell me!
We found a way to get the location of Ansari
we had been searching for a long time.
To get that, Ram and I
played a game Rasool.
Good cop… bad cop.
Hey, you!
- How dare you point a gun at me!
- Sir, sir!
- I will kill you, rogue.
- Sir!
- Vishnu, sir! Leave him.
- Ram! Leave me!
Sir, don't kill me, sir.
- Let me go, Ram!
- Sir, don't kill me, sir.
- I will kill you.
- Sir, please let go of me, sir.
Please let go of me, sir.
- This is Indian Army, wretch! What did you think?
- Sir, leave me, sir. Don't kill me.
- I will kill you, idiot!
- Don't kill me, please.
Vishnu, sir! Please control yourself!
I will kill you right now.
Brother, brother, save me.
Brother, help me!
He began to trust Ram.
Brother, help me!
That's what we wanted.
They killed Abbas right before my eyes.
I wanted to kill him that very moment.
Not just Abbas.
All these people in this photograph
will come here and die.
Who is this for?
Waheeda.
She will definitely come some day.
And then she will die.
She is only a kid.
She still has time.
If you don't want that to happen,
Ansari must die.
But I don't know where he is.
Tell me if you know.
I promise to keep Waheeda safe.
For the first time in Indian history, you
are crossing the border and entering POK.
To kill Ansari.
This secret operation is not for
creating destruction in their country.
But to prevent destruction in our country.
This operation on Ansari is known to Hon'ble
P M Mr Shastri, President Mr S Radharishnan
Army General G H Chaudhury
and only those present in this room.
If you come back alive, you should forget
this operation and so will we.
No rewards. No records.
Next day is just another day.
The only problem is
if you don't come back safe.
The Indian Army will forget you.
Including us.
There is no choice.
It's not even possible to bring you
back to India.
Because…
This operation will not exist
in both the countries' books.
Pakistan's Major Ayub Khan
has been our prisoner for two years.
Happy soul.
He has even put on weight.
But if you are caught by them, how your
situation will be, you can check for yourself.
Because they won't respect
Geneva Convention rules.
Living there is very difficult.
Dying is more comfortable.
Do you still want to cross the border
and kill Ansari?
Yes, sir!
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir!
Are you worried?
Hmm.
About Sita.
Weren't you scared looking at the gun
from so close?
It's a soldier I am going to marry.
Have you told Ram you are not Sita
but Princess Noorjahan?
Not yet.
I'll tell him today.
But who I am is not important.
It is important that Ram know the truth.
I don't know how he will react.
He will jump in joy, resign his job
and follow you.
Rekha! He is Ram!
Ram is home.
I'll talk to you later.
If you won't panic,
I have something to tell you.
What is it?
Are you scared?
Are you not scared?
Before I met you,
I was not scared.
But everyone has to die some day.
At the most what will they do?
They will dig a pit…
They will dig a pit and bury me.
That's what I used to think, Sita.
I had no one then.
So I never thought twice.
If something happens to me,
I want you to move…
Sati was banned many years ago.
You said you had something to say?
I want you to come back safe.
I shall follow you”
“I shall be with you”
“The cheek that's kissed”
“Is still moist”
Ram!
“Journeys have begun”
“Oh, love! Is it necessary?”
“Illusion is your address”
“You fill my heart, my love”
“How do I stop this pining?”
“To the end of space”
“My love has reached out”
“My memories with you”
“Don't melt away like snow”
“Your fragrance”
Ram!
“Oh, love! Is it necessary?”
- Why are you here?
- It's wet!
Before this dries,
you must return.
Promise me.
Ram!
Getting late.
Take care.
“Won't you look at me, beloved?”
“Don't take this as separation”
“Right under your feet is caught”
“My life… take a look”
“Distance has faded”
“In your warm breath”
“Before my sleep is disturbed”
“Come back, my dream”
“Oh, love! Is it necessary?”
“Illusion is your address”
He is our person.
Abdul!
Change your clothes first.
I will tell you what to do afterwards.
Who is it?
Brother Farooq has sent provisions.
Okay. Keep them inside.
- Oh, Saleem!
- Yes, brother.
- Boss is calling you two upstairs.
- Okay, brother.
Ansari seems to be upstairs.
Let's send him up from there.
If Kashmir should belong to the Muslims,
only one thing has to be done.
Catch each and every soldier
of the Indian army and kill them.
The death cries of those soldiers
should reverberate in the hills of Kashmir.
Hmm? Rudraksh?
Hey, who are you?
Brother! Hindustan…
Get up!
Challenge your modesty.
Come out!
Pick up weapons.
Conquer Kashmir!
Soldiers! Move!
You have the blessing of Allah.
Every person who is not a Muslim
is your enemy.
Let this holy war begin today itself.
Come back with Kashmir!
We shall offer it as a gift to Allah.
Pakistan-
Pakistan supports you.
At least in your next life,
try to understand this better.
Brave Madrasi!
Hail, hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Brother…
Brother…
Ram! Make it fast.
Waheeda…
Are you mad?
Ram! Don't go.
Everyone is dead except these two.
Hey! Are we both not good enough
to kill you all?
We didn't know how long
we had been in capture.
Minus temperatures.
Major was right.
It was difficult to survive
their torture.
Death was more comfortable.
Goal!
Sodiers! Stop this game.
What is this?
I am sorry for the
behavior of the soldiers.
If you didn't save the girl,
you would become heroes in India.
The humanity in your heart is visible
not only to me…
But to God as well.
Sir, clothes.
Please, take them.
Hey! Why would we wear your clothes?
Just by wearing these clothes,
you don't become Pakistani.
Wear them.
Or you will die of cold.
What? Are you trying to threaten us?
Dirty rascal!
I want to kill you!
- Not in the army camp.
- Where is Ram?
He said he will come back in a week.
It's a month now.
Where is he?
- What happened to him? I deserve to know.
- Calm down, Sita.
What actually happened to him?
How is he?
- I am just worried for him.
- Please listen to me.
The enquiry is on.
We'll inform you
when we know something.
This is a lie.
You are hiding… you are hiding something.
He said he was on some secret mission.
What secret mission?
I am the commanding officer here.
- You are hiding something. This is a lie.
- What are you talking about?
What is this notice?
They sent it saying Vishnu is missing.
You have to answer this.
Where is he?
How is he?
I don't know.
It's four weeks
since they both left the barracks.
I don't believe you.
- What are you talking about?
- You are hiding something.
And we can't be having this conversation.
Do you think Ram has no one to receive
at least a notice?
He has me.
Look at my daughter.
Have you no pity?
Where is he?
Tell us the truth.
They won't.
They won't tell us the truth.
I can get the truth out.
Let's go.
Ram, sir.
He has done a lot for the country, sir.
This is wrong, sir.
Sorry, sir.
The harsh reality is...
in a week from now,
we are going to declare them as deserters.
You will make everyone believe
they betrayed the army and are absconding.
- Why are you doing this, sir?
- We can't help it.
We are wearing the uniform, sir.
It has to be done.
Sorry, sir.
With your permission-
Hey, Ram! We don't even know
how long we have been here!
Hey, don't talk!
This is all because of you!
You have no one, bloody orphan!
I have a family!
Ram!
In your country,
you both are deserted soldiers.
That you broke the Indian Army code
and went absconding.
Sacrifice with no recognition.
You only have Sita waiting for you.
But for me?
One whole family is waiting!
Sir, where is Ram?
Princes Noorjahan!
Come, come, come!
Please be seated.
Phone calls from the President and
the Prime Minister in a gap of one hour.
That Princess Noorjahan is coming.
Do the needful.
I must tell you the truths
I haven't told anyone.
Because you are the richest
and most infulential lady.
I can decide not to tell you the truth
and you know that.
Sir!
I am not a princess.
I am Sitamahalakshmi.
I am Lieutenant Ram's wife.
Tell me the truth that he is safe.
The pain of not being
able to claim victory.
The responsibility of
not acknowledging defeat.
They killed Ansari and
some other 35 Mujahideens
But, unfortunetly he was captured
by Pakistan army.
Prison?
He is in prison?
Yes!
Ram is in a Pakistani prison.
I know you know many officials in Pakistan.
I won't marry Ram.
I will do whatever you say.
The damage is already done.
There is nothing I can do.
I will not marry Ram!
Please! Get him back somehow.
- Greetings, sir.
- You can leave!
Uh, Tariq!
- You wanted to discuss something?
- Yes, sir.
To free Colonel Abbas from India,
I have a great plan.
But only you can implement it.
Me? How is that?
Sir, you are aware.
We have two Indian soldiers in our custody.
Let us exchange them.
I swear by God,
you will become a hero then.
They are bloody Indians.
They don't respect their soldiers.
Sir!
Someone has come to see you
from the Indian Embassy.
- Hello!
- Hello!
I'm Rahul Varma.
What can I do for you?
We have a load of apples.
Healthy and in great condition.
We are aware that you have
two valuable mangoes with you.
We are concerned about them.
Yes, we do.
But they are slightly bad.
In a few days, they will be gone.
They will be dead soon.
There is a lot of demand
for mangoes in India.
You anyway love apples.
Why don't we barter them?
An exchange?
You are talking about Kashmir's apples.
We are ready to occupy the entire Kashmir.
I was joking.
We like your proposal.
We shall meet soon.
Mr Rahul, thank you very much
for coming as soon as I asked.
Please don't say that, Major Tariq.
I am supposed to thank you
for your help.
- I hope this works out.
- It will.
He never breaks his word.
He is going to meet President Ayub Khan.
If God permits…
Hail, Shriram.
Move, move!
Greetings, sir.
Sorry to disturb you, sir.
You both are going back to India.
What?
Are they releasing us?
Yes.
Really?
God's grace.
Sorry, Tariq.
I was very rude to you.
Please, don't take it to heart, Tariq.
- Please!
- Sir, call for you.
I am coming.
- It's about you.
- Okay, sir.
We'll have a drink together.
Sir!
Sir, we are going back to India, sir.
Hey, hey!
In my frustration, I called you an orphan.
Damn. I hate myself.
Sir!
Calm down, sir!
Sorry, man.
We are going to India.
God be with you, sir.
Tariq here.
- General said okay.
- Yes!
Thank you.
Thank you so much, sir.
- But not both of them.
- What?
- Only one will go.
- What?
I don't understand.
But you said we will release both!
I'll come and talk to you.
- Sir, sir, please listen to me.
- I said, I'll come and talk to you.
Hey, Tariq! What did they say?
When are they releasing us?
Not both.
Only one.
What did you say?
You said both of us?
Is this a game? Huh?
Vishnu Sir!
Sorry, sir.
Then which of us is it?
Me or him?
Hey, Tariq!
Please don't keep what I said in mind
and detain me here.
If necessary, I will fall at your feet.
- Send me at least for my family.
- Vishnu!
- Please, Tariq. I request you.
- What is this?
Behave yourself.
I understand now, Ram.
I know only you will go.
You colluded with him and deceived me.
You will leave me here like garbage,
and you will walk away, right?
Bloody orphan!
Are you crazy?
If either of us has to go,
it will be you.
Not me.
Okay?
By the way,
I too have someone
who will wait for me until death.
I am not an orphan, sir.
I am not able to forget the look
in his eyes till today.
For twenty years,
I have been living like a corpse.
All that I wanted that day
was to get out.
It didn't strike me
he would be left behind.
Is Ram still in the Pakistani prison?
In the same year...
your Pakistan army came to know
12 locations of Indian Army Base.
They conducted straight air bombing.
32 of our soldiers died.
Later,
we discovered
through our Intelligence Sources…
That Ram had leaked those co-ordinates.
I am sure he wouldn't do that.
The world that Ram lived in
started looking at him like an enemy.
I don't know if he had
really done the wrong thing.
But Sita carried its weight.
What did you say?
You had no connection with Ram?
He has been living in the Pakistani prison
for the past twenty years…
And I in this hell…
For one reason.
It's the cries of a baby girl
he heard that day.
Do you know who the kid is?
You.
What?
Are you kidding?
If he didn't hear you cry that day,
he would be happily living with Sita now.
And I would have been at peace.
Waheeda…
Waheeda.
But, that's impossible.
That's my childhood name.
How do you know?
No!
I promised Ram that I will deliver
this letter to Sitamahalakshmi.
This is a debt you must settle, Afreen.
Who am I indebed to?
To my grandfather or Ram?
Anyway, what is this friendship
between two enemies?
Meaningless.
Sir, you must start immediately.
You will miss your flight.
You are taking charge in Delhi tomorrow.
I'll be there in two minutes.
You go, wait.
You are a life saved by Ram.
I won't let you be in trouble here.
I will take the responsibility
of sending you back to Pakistan.
Where is Ram's letter?
I will see that Sita gets it.
Balaji has it.
By now, he must have given it to Sita.
Is Sita in Kashmir?
What is she doing here?
“The sweet memory of yesterday
doesn't leave my eyes any day”
“I shall cherish life-long
That never ending brief time”
“The wind and dust carry your perfume
I meet you afresh every day”
Hello!
Do you know Noorjahan's address?
Noorjahan?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know Noorjahan's address?
- No, Idea!
- I don't know.
Do you know where Sitamahalakshmi lives?
Madam Sitamahalakshmi lives
on the top of that hill.
- On the top of that hill.
- Yes!
Madam Sitamahalakshmi!
Ram's letter for you.
“Knowing you will not return”
Ram?
“The rain of questions has ceased”
It's been waiting for twenty years.
“I shall cherish life-long”
“That never ending brief time”
“The wind and dust carry your perfume”
“I meet you afresh every day”
Dearest Sitamahalakshmi!
In our beautiful story
this is the last page.
It has taken a little time
to reach you, Sita.
It's been eight months.
You are angry.
I can sense it.
I never saw you angry, Sita.
I am not lucky enough to see it in future.
You must be thinking about me…
as to how I am and if I am.
I know.
That's why I am writing this letter.
You must have heard a lot about me, Sita.
But…
Nothing you heard is true.
What you believe is the truth.
I am not a traitor.
Princess Noorjahan is somewhere in Kashmir.
Find out exactly where she is.
That letter shouldn't
fall into Sita's hands.
I will take the charge
and I will be back tomorrow.
Poor Vishnu sir.
He doesn't have a choice.
His situation is such.
Sir, they negotiated for two.
Only one will go.
Let them decide who wants to go.
It. Ram!
I can understand
what you must be going through.
India has left you like an orphan.
You must be angry with your country, right?
I am an orphan by birth.
But I was never angry with my mom.
Vishnu, I know you
are ready to die for your country.
But have you thought of your family?
Your parents live in Madras, don't they?
With them is Akram, Mujahidin.
Oh!
Congratulations!
You had a son last week.
The guy who is drinking coffee there-
Mustafa.
This time he was instructed only
to drink coffee and come away.
But if you don't co-operate,
instructions will have to be changed.
What do you want?
We want the co-ordinates
of army units in Kashmir.
Give us and walk away.
Just give us these co-ordinates
and we will send you back home.
I promise!
Don't put the same question to Vishnu sir.
He is not like me.
He will kill you.
Sir, he is convinced.
He's ready to give us the co-ordinates.
No!
Vishnu sir!
Vishnu sir!
No, sir.
Please listen to me, sir.
Don't do it, sir.
Don't give the co-ordinates, sir!
Valid information, Vishnu.
If this information is leaked,
you will live like a
traitor in your country.
If you support us,
you will live happily with your family.
No, sir!
Please, sir!
- He will become the culprit.
- Sir, please.
You will regret it life-long.
Vishnu sir!
No, sir!
No!
Vishnu sir!
Don't give the co-ordinates, sir!
Please don't torture Ram to death.
Vishnu sir, please!
Please treat him like a soldier.
No, sir!
Vishnu sir, please!
You will regret it life-long.
Don't give the co-ordinates, sir!
I can see…
this letter getting wet with your tears.
I can see!
Wipe it!
I can hear…
Your voice calling me there.
I can hear it
wiping away the silence around me.
Move, move!
Time is up!
Move, fast!
Move!
Ram! Let me know
if there's anything I can do.
I need your help.
Can you please send this letter to Sita.
Bye!
Please forget me.
Because by the time you read this letter,
I would have gone.
Ram!
To the queen who left behind everything
for a soldier with 600 rupees monthly pay,
Good bye for this life.
Princess Noorjahan!
"Knowing you will not return"
"the rain of questions has ceased"
"I shall cherish life-long"
"That never ending brief time"
As a result Brigadier Vishnu Sharma
drew his own pistol and shot himself dead.
Based on the letter written by late It. Ram,
an enquiry is initiated under Army Act 34A
Seetamahalakshmi.
Before I came here,
someone asked me to apologize to them.
I was angry.
But if I don't do it now,
I feel I might die.
I'm sorry!
Thank you for the letter.
Is Ram alive?
No!
