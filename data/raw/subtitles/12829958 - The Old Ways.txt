Demonio!
Come here, my love.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid, Mama.
I'm strong.
You'll see…
Everything's going
to be all right, okay?
Everything's going to be all right.
My little girl, look at me.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be--
Hello?
Do you speak English?
My name is Cristina Lopez.
I, I am an American…
A reporter.
Why were you at La Boca?
La Boca?
Okay, yes…
I'm doing a story.
I'm here…
I was invited to do a story
on some of the local tribes
and cultures.
What were you looking for
in La Boca?
I'm trying to tell you,
to explain why--
background…
research for the story,
for the piece.
You understand?
Is this about money?
Because I can get that for you.
This is how it is.
This is how it will be.
I have a number
that you can call,
and they'll pay, I swear.
Please, I just--
I need my bag.
Do you, um…
No.
Uh, do you know
Miranda Flores?
-Miranda?
- Yes, yes.
Yes, she'll tell you.
She's my cousin.
If you find her,
she'll tell you.
I should not be here.
I should not be here!
She has it.
"Has it"?
No. No.
No, I don't have anything.
I don't have anything!
No, no, no, no! No!
- This is how it is.
This is how it will be.
This is how it is.
This is how it will be.
This is how it will be.
What. The actual. Fuck?
May I?
- Go ahead.
-Miranda.
Oh, thank God.
Are you all right?
No, I'm pretty goddamn
far from all right.
Look, I tried to tell them
I am not whoever
they think I am.
They just don't understand
what I'm saying.
They don't believe
they can let you go.
Well, tell them they can.
Please.
La Boca, why did you go there?
Why does that even matter now?
I told you not to.
-It was not safe.
-Are you serious?
Because it's my job
to go to places
people tell me not to go.
There are 10,000 caves
in these jungles.
-What difference does it make?
-It's not a cave. It's a ruin.
What does it matter?
What matters
is that I told you not to go.
Do you know these people?
They've always been here.
The old man, Javi…
He's her son.
He helps. The woman,
she practices the old ways.
She's… a bruja?
This is…
insane.
They wish to help you.
Miranda, I'm in chains.
They're forcing goat milk
down my throat.
I'm pissing in a bucket.
They have seen…
something inside you.
You care to elaborate?
A demon.
A demon?
They think I have
a demon inside me?
Okay.
So this is easy.
I don't.
Tell them and get me
the fuck out of here.
They won't let you leave
with whatever is in you.
You have to do something,
call someone,
get the authorities.
These people here…
they are the authorities.
I need my--my bag.
Can you ask them
if they have it?
I can show them
what I've been doing.
Javi, did she have a bag?
-Look.
You see?
Nothing, no demons.
La Boca.
Javi, please.
-Carson?
-Cristina?
I'm being held hostage.
I'm somewhere west of Catemaco.
Please, you have
to come find me!
Call someone!
Call the embassy!
-I'm in the fucking jungle!
-Cristina!
She'll begin tomorrow,
first light.
Hold on.
If they think it worked…
if they cure me or exorcise me
or whatever…
Will they let me go?
Hey.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
It's okay.
No, do you speak English?
Do you speak English?
How about you, huh?
Little help?
Any idea where we are?
Oh, no English either.
Got it.
Don't give me that look, Chip.
It's the place, isn't it?
Where you grew up?
You don't want
to talk about it.
You never talk about it,
which is why
I'm more than a little
concerned you want this one.
When's the last time you slept?
When's the last time
I missed a deadline?
-Carson…
-Hmm.
I'm good.
I mean…
I could be better.
Yeah.
Oh, shit.
-Okay, we're--we're starting?
-Breathe.
W-w-what's happening?
What are they doing
right now exactly?
They say it came last night.
No, no, no, no, no,
that was not that.
This will show them more.
There are many demons
that live in those ruins.
She says this will show
her its name.
She says you will see many things.
Maybe not now…
but soon.
The demon will
show itself to you.
When you see, you must
tell her right away.
That way it won't get stronger.
What happens
if I don't see it?
She wants to know what
happens if she can't see it?
You will see.
You will see.
Wait, Miranda,
where are you going?
This part you do alone.
Okay.
Fuck it.
Here we go.
Oh, God.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
It's happening!
I see it!
It's a really fucking
horrible thing!
Aah!
Hey.
Hey!
Hey!
There's a snake in here!
There's a fucking snake in here!
Hello?
Help!
Miranda?
Someone help!
Oh, my God.
Oh.
Help!
Oh, my God.
Someone!
Miranda!
Please!
Can I bring you anything else?
Where were you?
When you heard me screaming…
Why didn't you help me?
I am helping.
You believe them.
You actually believe in this shit?
Didn't you go to school
in Mexico City?
You should know things.
You're supposed
to at least be my family.
Don't say that word
like you know what it means.
Yes, you are my family,
but you haven't been for a lifetime.
That wasn't my choice.
Twenty years?
Never once?
I didn't ask…
when you returned here
because you are family.
You want to help me?
I need you to convince them
that this is working.
It will show itself.
They will know.
This isn't where I was meant to die.
Aah!
What happened?
I don't know.
You couldn't see?
I felt sick.
Maybe it was something I ate.
I…
was confused.
Bad goat's milk?
It's almost here.
What are those?
Thought you might like
to know what's inside you.
You know I can't
read this, right?
You still don't believe?
I mean,
this is a little much.
-And before?
-What do you mean before?
Are you talking about my--
What happened
with your mother.
You can't remember
what you saw then?
You can't understand
what you see now?
I don't know
what's in my food.
I don't know what's in my milk.
I don't know what day it is.
I don't even know
what time it is.
One phone call…
how much?
They don't have to know it was you.
I don't want money.
I won't make it.
This isn't you.
It's what's inside you.
It fears that you will let it go.
Miranda…
Wait.
Which one is it?
That she can see?
The red book.
I marked the page.
"Postehki."
What's that?
Something to protect you.
Our abuelita made one for each of us
to ward off
any evil spirits
that escaped.
You don't believe…
but I do.
That one was yours.
I saved it.
I don't remember this.
Why did you go to La Boca?
You can't speak Spanish anymore.
You don't believe in
the culture or the traditions.
I saw it…
in your eyes.
When I told you to stay away
from that place,
that it had always been
a dangerous, cursed place,
that people do not return
from La Boca…
Your eyes…
they came to life.
You had found what you came back for.
After your mother…
Aah!
After you were taken…
Abuelita told me
there was a sadness
inside of me,
like a seed,
and for a time,
I could nurture it, feed it,
give it what it needed,
but then I would have to starve it
before it bore fruit…
Because that is what they feast upon.
But you were found
before it could consume you,
thank God.
How did they find me?
Cristina?
What?
I… I don't…
This is a spirit healing,
a psychic surgery.
Hey.
Ah.
What is that?
That was different.
We need to go deeper.
Oh!
What the fuck?
Aah! My--
No!
Oh, my God!
Aah!
Stop, stop, please! God!
No!
Get it out, get it out.
Oh!
Oh, please!
No.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Pull it, help me.
Help me.
Miranda.
Miranda.
Please help me!
Miranda!
Mm.
I, um--
-It was only--
-Don't say necessary.
None of this is fucking necessary.
It was you.
No one goes to this place.
No one else could find me…
except you.
You brought me to them.
I didn't know how far
they would have to go,
-how deep it was--
-Of course you wouldn't call.
Of course
you wouldn't do anything.
This is what you wanted.
Only to help, Cristina.
No!
No!
In the corner.
This is a holy place.
You are not welcome here.
You want milk?
It's still inside of me,
isn't it?
Help me.
Please.
Where there is forgiveness,
there is peace.
I'm sorry…
if you even understand that.
Oh, here, I-I got it.
Hand me some bandages?
Wait, you understand me?
Okay.
Well, that would have been
helpful to know.
How come you didn't let me know
that you understood me?
Because I'm not the first
person who's attacked you.
Yeah.
I guess I'd keep
my distance, too.
You will keep talking?
I ask a lot of questions.
Force of habit.
What's that?
How did she know that
there was something inside me?
What did she see?
Well sometimes,
when she looks…
something else looks back.
How long have you been doing this?
My father helped.
He died when I was
around 16 years old.
Naturally or…
unnaturally?
Something went wrong…
with an exorcism.
It found my father.
My mother,
she couldn't get it out.
He was strong… for us.
He went to the river…
swallowed stones…
and was gone.
What happens
when your mother's gone?
Will you be taking over?
Not my path.
My mother, she got very sick.
We didn't even have money
for her medicine…
but somehow we managed
to get a healer.
After it didn't work…
I was put into foster care.
You know, one little dose
of medicine instead…
It could have
changed everything.
That healer…
she had no idea
what she did to my life.
Or maybe, I don't know,
maybe…
Maybe it was something.
Someone needs to fight these demons
or spirits or whatever.
No…
The old ways die with her.
We have no moves left.
Demons…
Demons…
Demons.
The broken man.
Postehki, the death god
of broken things.
Fills you with darkness,
feeds on pain.
Broken souls returning
to be consumed.
This. What about this?
The broken man?
-No.
-No, what?
-This is--
-Drawing it out.
Making it real.
If we bring it out,
can we destroy it?
It's very dangerous.
It's very painful.
Can we do it?
Okay, is it focused?
Am I in focus?
Okay, just fuck it.
Press the record button.
In three, two…
This is Cristina Lopez.
A few weeks ago,
I came to the city of Catemaco
looking for a lost culture,
one of people whose beliefs
couldn't be more different from…
I'm sorry.
Just one more time.
My name is Cristina Lopez.
I came to this place to die.
I took this assignment
because I knew it would keep me
as far away from the things I had seen
and the things I had done
than I could ever hope for.
I chose to go to a place
where no one would find me…
Where people warned me
to keep away from…
A place where I could die
in the darkness.
I wouldn't be here,
except…
there are people in this world
that are very different than me…
people who see someone in pain
and suffering…
and they don't turn away in disgust.
So if you want to follow me,
I can show you
around a little bit.
Over here, we got my bed,
also occasionally
breakfast nook.
Oh, over in this corner,
we got a…
a half bath,
and, uh…
This…
this was a gift from my family.
What's your name?
Hmm?
What's your name?
Luz.
Luz.
Thank you, Luz.
It's time.
Okay, she's ready.
You will see.
Don't be afraid.
Mama?
I saw it.
It only showed itself to you now.
What else did you see?
I saw the boy.
-What boy?
-The boy.
The boy that lives around here.
Do you see him now?
There!
Move the bed!
Demon, out!
- Demon, out!
Demon, out!
With this strength…
With this faith…
No.
I cast you out!
-No!
This is how it is.
This is how it will be.
The old ways…
die with you.
I wish I was a better person.
For her sacrifice.
Do not wish to be better.
Just be.
Is it really gone?
Venti, extra-hot,
half-caff soy latte.
I ordered the…
pumpkin spice?
-Is that right?
-Oh, that's right.
Perfect.
You will go back
to Los Angeles?
To the traffic and the bars…
and forget about all of this again?
I mean,
what's the alternative?
Maybe this is
where you belong.
That place doesn't exist.
I never thought
you'd come back, Cristina.
None of us did.
-And…
-Hold on.
-Here you are.
-Hold on.
-Hello?
-Cristina?
-Carson.
-Cristina?
Can you hear me?
Hold on.
I'm sorry.
I have to take this.
-Carson?
-Can you hear me?
I can--I can hear you, yeah.
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm fine.
-How can you be fine?
-Well, I'm alive.
No.
No, no, stop.
Don't come looking for me.
Just--just go to the village, okay?
I'll find you.
Miranda?
Miranda?
Leave.
You have no reason to stay.
Miranda--
-Leave!
-I want to be here.
I asked for more time
to be here…
with you.
You don't belong here.
Miranda--
Oh, God.
She didn't destroy it.
It got out.
Cristina…
stop it.
Oh, it's inside you.
You're scaring me!
I'm so sorry, Miranda.
I don't feel it.
I don't feel anything.
I-I only feel--
Empty.
She's gone.
They're gone.
We can't stop it.
-You can.
-No.
You know what this is.
You've faced it.
-You read the books. You--
-No, I can't.
I'll only hurt you.
I'll make it worse. I can't.
You don't believe, but I do.
Cristina?
What is it?
It's time.
You ready?
No. You?
No.
"Light fall
upon the darkness.
Fire wash the soul."
Cristina…
you're hurting me.
"To the earth you are driven.
To the ground you are trapped."
"You are broken."
"You are bare.
You are lost."
"You are found."
Cristina, stop.
Please stop.
Stop!
You want this.
You want me to hurt her.
You need me to hurt her.
She must be broken.
Hear my voice and understand.
I won't leave you alone again.
She cannot be saved.
Only sacrificed.
Miranda, listen to me.
It can't live inside you.
It's starving.
She must die…
for the darkness to grow.
I see you.
Miranda?
What is it?
What do you see?
It's here.
Postehki.
"You will see."
-Can you see some--
-Miranda!
-Can you stand?
It's okay.
Come on.
What?
It'll find us.
It won't stop.
Cristina, please.
Come on.
This is why you brought me here.
I'm not what you made me.
I'm a motherfucking Bruja.
We found an American at La Boca.
Get the fuck off of me!
Look, I, uh-- I don't know
what this is about.
If it's money,
I can pay you money.
I have--
What's happening?
What is this?
Carson…
you have a demon inside of you.
Cristina…
you're not well.
I have to warn you,
we're not good at this,
but we're gonna get better.
Look, I--I brought you
what you need, okay?
It's in my bag.
We're gonna get you even, deal?
No.
I don't think we're gonna do that.
There is no demon, Cristina.
Please, let me take you back.
-Okay? Please?
How about we get you some milk?
