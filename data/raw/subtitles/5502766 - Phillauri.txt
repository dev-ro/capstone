What is the purpose of your visit?
Wedding..
I'm getting married.
Getting married?
What!
You still haven't finished?
You've still got the face pack on?
Kanan's flight has landed.
Kanan is here!
"My eyes have twinkled today."
"My kohled eyes await you."
"I'm laughing and dancing.
I'm all decked up."
"I pray no one casts
an evil eye."
"Congratulations,
let's dance together. "
"Let the wedding bells ring,
let's all sing.."
He's here! Let's go!
"I wish to dance with you."
"Let's do a bottom's up.."
Hi, Mom.
My dear!
My child is here.
Why are you crying?
Tell me.
Was it so cold in Canada that
your emotions froze too?
These are tears of happiness.
I'm seeing you after three years.
Can't I even hug you?
Let's go.
It's a long drive back.
Oh.. You look so tired.
What have you done to your hair?
Style!
Hey, this looks so dirty,
why haven't you cleaned it properly?
There is a wedding in the house.
Come on, get serious!
Come on, keep this on the ground.
How will he manage alone?
We had asked for four people,
but you've got only two.
Are you kidding me?
- Piyush..
Keep all these inside. - Yes.
- It's been so long. - I'll tell him.
I have been waiting.
- Look, she's angry now.
"I'm sober, yet high.
But I'm still arrogant."
"They say they don't get high,
and yet they drink."
"I greet them, and they say
they wish to dance with me."
"Let's do a bottom's up
and shake our bodies."
"I greet them, and they say
they wish to dance with me."
Where's L?
Oh! - Nikhil!
- Where is he?
He'll embarrass us again.
He'll ruin all our plans.
L for Lazy.
The groom has arrived!
He's here!
He always does this.
- Calm down.
How many times do I tell him!
The groom has arrived!
Welcome!
Welcome!
We all missed you.
Kanan!
Come..
Please come.
- Come, dear.
Thank you. - Bless me.
- May God bless you. - All okay?
Reached? - What's up?
- Fine.
I'll take you to task now!
Where were you?
L for Loafer.
The priest wants to know when
he has to perform the rituals.
He has to go somewhere else.
Everybody here has had a drink.
Usha, you don't drink.
You handle this.
He's asking for grandma.
He can ask me umpteen
number of questions.
He is not going to get
a straight answer.
I have been drinking since morning.
Let's all go.
It'll get covered up.
We have to go and tell them about it.
- Yes.
Tell them what?
You're..
You're joking, right?
It's funny, but it's not a joke.
Aishwarya had got it done.
I had read it in the local newspaper.
Who believes in such superstitions
nowadays?
It's up to you.
You had asked for his horoscope.
I'm only suggesting a solution
to the problem.
Some brown people shiz, man!
Who's brown here?
Everybody in the family
is nice and fair.
Dear, since this is for Anu,
why don't you do it?
Since this is for Anu,
why doesn't she do it?
But you are the one
born under a cursed star.
So, you are the one who
has to get married.
Yes, sir.
To a tree?
Isn't it enough that
I'm marrying Anu?
Now I have to marry a tree as well?
What difference does it make, dear?
Think of it as a joke.
It's just a small ritual, let's get
it over with and move ahead.
Okay,
enough of this serious discussion.
Michie, let's go.
Let's have a drink.
Mom, what is this..
- Let's go.
So what can I get you?
"My beloved is here,
and the ambience is made."
Technology has advanced so much
and you're still listening
to these old records?
I like them. You can play
something else, if you want to.
Why play anything else?
Kanan will sing for us.
Kanan!
What?
Come on, come on.
Let us also listen to what
he's rapping about in Canada.
Come on, dear, sing.
Sing for us.
Okay, enough!
Forget about him,
I will sing for you.
No need. Two pegs down and he
thinks he is Honey Singh.
That's all right.
He's just singing.
Anu's grandfather would go wild
after a couple of drinks.
Once, at somebody else's house
he asked the way to their bedroom
and took me inside.
He had so much energy, I swear!
- God!
Mom..
What is it?
Don't get uppity.
You're also the result
of one such incident.
Fantastic!
"The dhoti is silky and
the kurta looks amazing."
"The bride was crazy for the groom."
"The bride was blushing,
she fell for the groom."
"Her eyes were mesmerising."
"I lost my senses,
I don't know why or what."
"Fun and frolic is all we do."
"This night is mischievous,
fun and frolic is all we do."
"Fun and frolic is all we do."
"Fun and frolic is all we do."
Is everything all right?
What is this new thing
you've started?
It's cool.
You have always been cool, baby.
Why do you need to do all this?
Anu, don't irritate me, please.
Okay, sorry.
Do you know the wedding
is fixed for Baisakhi?
Grandma says it's a very
auspicious day.
For which wedding?
The one with the tree?
By the way,
what were you saying in the morning?
About?
"Isn't it enough that
I'm marrying Anu?"
Dude, I was angry. I'm supposed
to marry a tree? Seriously?
So what?
I'll be the second wife.
And the second wife always
has more fun than the first.
What happened, baby?
Isn't everything happening too fast?
We've been seeing each
other since high school.
How much more time do you need?
Don't you need more time?
I've been waiting for
this day forever.
I don't even know what I'm doing next
month. Forget about forever.
Whatever you'll be doing,
it will be with me, right?
What's the guarantee?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
Are you seeing somebody else?
Tell me, Kanan.
Don't you want to marry me?
What are you doing, Kanan?
We're getting married in five days.
Everything is fixed now.
- Chill, Anu, chill.
I know that everything is fixed.
What's the problem?
You're marrying me, right?
Yes, I am.
Who else will I marry?
So how does it make a difference
if we get married now or later?
I can't keep waiting for you to
be in the right frame of mind.
That's true.
So you're happy, right?
According to your horoscope
if you don't marry a tree first
something terrible will happen
after your marriage.
Such as, both of you can fall ill.
Your careers might get ruined.
But this won't happen now.
After marrying the tree
all your problems will be sorted.
And you'll lead a comfortable life.
Let's start the ceremony.
Smile.
- Oh, selfie time!
Come here, dear.
Come and sit.
Congratulations to all of you.
The ceremony is now complete.
- Congratulations.
Congratulations!
- My dear..
Congratulations!
Smile.
Kanan, selfie!
Bheem Singh, here's the money,
you can cut down the tree now.
Excuse me!
Can you hear me?
Listen.
Kanan!
Kanan!
What happened, dear?
What happened?
What happened?
Tell us.
That..
- What?
That..
- What, son?
Ghost..
- What are you saying?
There is no one here.
- Ghost.
There's nothing here.
There is! I was lifted up.
I saw her.
You must've had a nightmare, my dear.
No, no. - My dear. - It wasn't
a dream. It wasn't a dream.
Dolly, handle it.
- It's okay.
Come on, let's go.
- Yes, let's go.
There's nothing to worry about.
- Let's go.
You got us worried for nothing.
Don't worry, go to sleep.
Are you scared?
Do you want me to sleep beside you?
No, no..
Oh, my baby got scared.
It's all because of that, isn't it?
- What?
Should I tell your mom and dad?
No.. Anu!
Anu!
Please stop, please.
Stop all this nonsense.
This shouldn't be causing it.
- But it is.
Maybe it was a BT.
A bad trip.
Come on, forget it.
Now go to sleep. Okay?
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Anu..
Anu! Anu! Anu!
Anu!
- What happened?
Dude,
I think I'm still having a bad trip.
Can I sleep with you?
- No way!
Please, please, please.
Don't try to pull any
stunts at night.
What?
- You know..
Nothing will happen between
us before we get married.
Dude, are you crazy?
I couldn't even if I wanted to..
Nothing is gonna happen.
This is all a result of that.
What if you can't,
even after marriage?
It's nothing like that, okay?
I..
"Oh, shoot, I saw a ghost."
"Oh shoot, I saw a ghost."
Sir..
Sir, don't!
- You?
Sir, stop!
Hey!
Listen.
No!
Sir, no!
Sir, no!
Ma'am!
Ma'am..
Ma'am..
Kanan, what's wrong with you?
You're still in your boxers?
I've got the fright of my life
and you're worried about my boxers?
What?
What's your problem?
What's wrong with my boxers?
Problem?
Don't you have to get dressed?
Dressed?
Won't you change your clothes?
Clothes?
Kanan, quickly go downstairs
and change your clothes.
The guests have started arriving
for the engagement ceremony.
I don't want to go.
I'm fine like this.
I'll wear some of dad's clothes.
Kanan, stop talking rubbish.
Go downstairs.
Do whatever you want to,
I'm not going downstairs.
Kanan, do you want me to slap you?
Go downstairs and change
your clothes.
Send somebody else instead, please.
Wait, just you wait.
Piyush!
- Yes?
Piyush!
- Yes, ma'am?
Go to Kanan's room and..
- No!
No?
I don't want to go to his room.
Why?
I'm scared.
Scared?
Who are you scared of?
He..
What..
What can I say, ma'am?
You won't be able to
handle the truth.
Shut up!
Just go to his room and get his suit.
He's waiting upstairs.
He's waiting upstairs?
Yes.
He isn't downstairs?
- No.
Of course, I'll get it.
Why didn't you tell
me that he's upstairs?
I.. Okay then, he's not in his room.
What's going on?
So early in the morning..
- How are you, Kanan?
You too?
Both father and son are
driving me insane.
Okay, come like this,
come in your underwear.
Come naked for all I care.
Why would I care?
Yes, Piyush, come in..
This can't be happening.
But it is.
Who are you?
I'm stuck here from last night.
Who are you?
Why have you got me here?
I.. I..
Why would I get you here?
How do I know?
That's why I'm asking you.
You're driving me crazy.
You faint, you run away..
Tell me, why have you got me here?
Why am I here?
What have you done?
- I.. I didn't do anything.
Don't lie to me.
- I.. I.. I didn't. I just woke up.
And you.. You were there. - I know,
but what did you do before that?
I went to my room and slept?
Idiot, what did you do before that?
I had gone to that tree.
- Tree!
'After marrying the tree,
all your problems'
'will be sorted.
The ceremony is now complete.'
What are you doing?
You're a ghost.
I'm scared.
Okay. Take me back there.
W-Where to?
- To the tree.
The tree isn't there anymore.
- What do you mean?
It has been cut down.
- Why?
I'm born under a cursed star.
- So?
So they cut down the tree
after I got married to it.
So that's why I'm here.
- Why?
You don't marry a tree,
you marry a girl.
And there was only one girl there.
That was me.
You didn't marry the tree.
You married me.
Hey, Kanan..
What happened, my dear?
You had a bath with your clothes on?
What..
You..
- Greetings. Greetings.
Whoa, whoa!
How old are you?
I..
26.
What?
- 26.
That's a long time to wait.
- For what?
For you to die.
I.. I.. I..
I.. I.. I..
Why do I have to die?
Death is inevitable.
For everyone.
And I can be free only when you die.
It's not like I can
do any more dying.
So, for me to get rid of you,
I.. I'll have to kill myself?
Stop talking nonsense.
You will die when your time comes.
You could meet with an accident.
Or I..
I could even live for 100 years.
Please don't say that.
I hope you die soon so
that I am free of you.
Here I'm the one who is
saddled with a ghost.
You want to get rid of me?
Yes,
but you are the one who married me.
But..
But I didn't do it on purpose.
I'm not exactly having a party here.
I agree I've made a mistake,
but is there no way out?
Apart from me dying?
Can't you just go?
Where?
You have cut down the tree.
So.. You..
You..
Were you alive before you died?
No, no. I was born a ghost.
- What?
What!
Are you daft?
If you've a home,
why don't you go there?
Home..
Here..
One minute.
Take a deep breath.
Once more..
Greetings.
What's the problem?
- Oh, my heart.
Should I ask brother to
give you some medicine?
Shut up, you idiot.
I don't need a medicine.
Then, what's the matter?
Is it there?
- Yes, it is.
You keep saying you don't
like Phillauri.
But you look forward to reading
his poems every Monday.
Our village is called Phillaur,
so all of us are Phillauris.
So, how can you say that
this was written by that fool?
You..
You don't call him names.
Everybody knows that he's the
only one who is so talented.
Oh!
Oh my,
do you want him all to yourself?
You won't be able to handle it.
Please read it.
'An unfolding of love.
Like unfurling of wings.'
'Love flies in like a
beautiful phoenix.'
'Disruptive. Breaking the dawn.
With the edge of its beak.'
'I have coaxed it to stay.'
'Fattened on sugar drops,
from the tip of my tongue.'
'I am hoping it will murmur my name.'
'And it surely will.'
'They say it pierces its heart,
on the thorns of roses.'
'And blood blossoms,
as eternal spring.'
'They say it will build
a thorny nest.'
'And have you rock-a-bye,
on a lullaby of sighs.'
'And when every second'
'will pass like an eon'
'and your soul burns
and dies in autumn fall.'
'It will move on.
Sing another song.'
'Coax another heart.'
'Into a trap of its own making.'
'Phillauri.'
Great.
You write so well.
Oh, forget it, Soma.
What's the point?
I won't even get enough
money to buy some liquor.
You're right.
Come on, Phillauri, sing!
- Come on, Phillauri, sing!
Phillauri!
Hello, everyone.
How are you doing?
Are you ready for some fun?
Let me tell you a story.
It so happened
that I got into a spot of
trouble for no fault of mine.
You all know everyone
sings my praises.
You are well aware what
a gentleman I am.
What happened after that?
"There was a house
of decent people."
"A girl was in there,
and the window was open."
"There was a house
of decent people."
"A girl was in there,
and the window was open."
What happened next?
- "She got drenched in joy"
"when she took Phillauri's name."
"He was playing Tumba for everyone."
"Phillauri dances and plays it
for the women of the village."
"Phillauri dances and plays it
for the women of the village."
"Phillauri dances.."
"Let me enlighten you,
listen to my tale."
"I woo girls and they fall for me."
"Stop being pretentious
and enjoy the moment."
"Don't miss this chance
to enjoy this"
"moment for the sake
of your inhibitions."
"O' friend, don't ask me again
what would happen next."
"If both have agreed,
there would be no betrayal."
"There was a lady who was hard
to get and she was a fair one."
"She had a fair husband
who was deaf."
What happened next?
- "Phillauri was able to woo her"
"and she fell for him."
"He was playing Tumba for everyone."
"Phillauri dances and plays it
for the women of the village."
"Phillauri dances and plays it
for the women of the village."
"Phillauri dances.."
"O' friend, don't ask me again
what would happen next."
"If both have agreed,
there would be no betrayal."
"O' friend, don't ask me again
what would happen next."
"Don't ask me again what
would happen next.."
Where are the..
- What's going on?
What?
- What.. What is going on?
I'm getting engaged.
E-Engagement.
What's that?
- I'm getting engaged.
I've been telling you since morning.
And you've realized it now?
Since morning..
- Who is getting engaged? You?
Yes.
- He's troubling me.
You've ruined my life by marrying me.
Now, it's her..
- Please, please, be quiet.
Please.
- Why? Why should I be quiet?
Are you okay?
Yes.
What's wrong with him today?
"The auspicious day is here, come,
the courtyard is decorated."
"I met my soulmate."
"Congratulate me for that."
"He will come"
"with the wedding procession"
"and take me away."
She's here.
- Who's here?
Anu.
- Who? - Anu.
"My beloved."
"I met my soulmate."
"I met my soulmate."
"I met my soulmate."
How do I look?
She is naked?
- Naked!
Yes, look.
Naked?
- No. No.. No..
No. It's a song.
I've composed a new song.
"You are naked but so nice.."
"The world's naked in my eyes."
What is wrong, Kanan?
Why isn't she wearing clothes?
What are you doing?
- Kanan, put this ring on.
Come on.
Here.
Beautiful couple.
Congratulations.
What's up, everyone!
The boy from Canada
and the girl from Punjab
are getting engaged.
Let's all raise a toast.
It's time to dance.
Record!
Good evening!
- Good evening!
Meet the editor of the journal,
Preetam.
Mr. Gurbaksh Singh.
People of Phillaur,
how are you doing?
All is well, sir.
Today we will play Gauhar Jaan's
new record for you.
Shashi! Good evening.
- Good evening.
Why are you dressed so fine today?
The gramophone people
have come from the city.
Everybody is going there.
Shashi, won't you come too?
No.
Don't you have anything better to do?
Is it a religious gathering?
Or is it a speech by one
of our freedom fighters?
I don't understand what is wrong
with the youth of our village.
They don't care about the country.
And you?
How is it that you are going there?
Let me talk to your father.
- No, no, no!
I'm going. I'm going home.
I'm not going for the show.
I'm going home.
I don't know what I should do.
I guess I've bad luck.
Shashi..
- Yes?
Don't get involved
in all this, my dear.
No, don't worry.
I have no interest in such frivolity.
The whole village may go,
but I won't.
Will this box play the song?
- Yes.
How on earth did the singer get
inside that with all the musicians?
In that small box.
I think Amrit is back.
Is the doctor at home?
Greetings.
- Greetings, Doctor.
I'm from the neighbouring village.
One of their friends got
into a scuffle with the British
and he got shot.
Brother..
I'm locking the door from outside.
Go to sleep. And if anyone asks,
don't say anything.
I haven't heard anything.
What will I say? - Bless you.
Let's go.
Greetings.
- Shashi.
Soma..
Isn't she the doctor's sister?
- Who? Shashi?
She's not your type.
She's very respectable.
What makes you think
I'm not respectable?
Let her be.
She doesn't even come to
listen to your songs.
"I feel so restless today.."
"I feel so restless today.."
"My excitement knows no bounds.."
"I feel so restless today.."
"My excitement
knows no bounds.."
"I am all ecstatic today.."
"I feel so restless today.."
"I am unaware what the
consequences will be.."
"I have no idea
what would happen now.."
"I feel so restless today.."
Take this, my dear.
This week's journal.
Thank you.
- Have a good day.
Let's go.
What happened?
Isn't it there?
Gurbaksh Singh, the editor has
written an open letter to Phillauri.
Asking him to disclose his identity.
This was bound to happen.
Phillauri writes so beautifully.
I think he should come forward.
Tell me, if he writes so well,
why does he have to be secretive?
He sings these songs
in front of everyone.
Hello, ladies.
How are you, Ms. Amrit?
Very well.
- Let's go.
Why, Shashi? Why don't you come
to listen to my songs?
Girls don't go to such gatherings.
Of course they do.
They come secretively.
But you don't do that.
Are you scared of your brother?
Your songs are not worth
listening to.
You don't like my songs,
but you read my poems in the journal.
You can fool the world
but how can you lie to yourself?
You have been blessed with
such a good voice.
Everybody comes to listen
to you sing.
You are so fortunate.
People will listen to
every word you say.
Do you know, only a few people
get this kind of opportunity?
You can change the way people think.
But you?
You sing meaningless songs.
Your songs have no depth or poetry.
No poetry?
An unfolding of love.
Like unfurling of wings.
Love flies in like a
beautiful phoenix.
Disruptive. Breaking the dawn
with the edge of its beak.
I have coaxed it to stay.
Fattened on sugar drops.
From the tip of..
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I'm sure nobody dances like this
even in brothels.
If the elders drink like this
what will the children learn?
Why can't you leave me alone?
Please.
You know why..
A married woman has to stay in her
husband's house as
long as she lives.
But aren't you dead already?
I died a spinster and got
married after that.
Why are you bringing this up again?
- It's the truth.
You have done this.
You cut down the tree.
And who gets married to a tree?
What the..
Why don't you leave me alone?
You want me to leave you alone?
Great.
She's been drinking too.
No, look.. I wasn't..
I wasn't talking to you.
Who were you talking to then?
Who else is here?
Wait.. Look.. There is.. There
is something I need to tell you.
It's like this..
We have a big problem. Okay?
I got married, by mistake..
- Mistake?
Am I a mistake?
- No.. No. - I knew it.
That's why you were behaving
so weirdly over there.
Hey, that's because..
That's because of Shashi.
Who is Shashi?
This freaking girl I'm seeing!
Finally,
you are telling me the truth.
You are having an affair with
somebody else. Isn't it?
Not that kind of seeing someone,
I can actually see someone.
I can see a girl.
That kind of seeing.
I can see a ghost. I..
I can see a ghost. - Shut up!
What..
- Enough.
Enough of this nonsense, Kanan.
You don't think of me at all, do you?
You kept saying you
wanted to go to Canada.
Who helped you then?
I did.
I convinced your parents
to let you go.
I said, let him fulfil his dreams.
And you..
You disappeared for three years.
When I asked you why,
you just sent me a message saying..
"But baby, I love you",
with a smiley.
And I was okay with it.
You said we should get betrothed
and get married later.
I agreed to that too.
Who gets betrothed over Skype, Kanan?
On Skype!
And today,
when we are finally getting engaged
you are behaving as
if you don't want to.
But Anu, I want to.
I want to get engaged to you.
Please just..
- Thanks, man.
You are doing me a big favour,
aren't you
by agreeing to marry me?
Did anyone ask me before
finalizing this?
Are you being forced into this?
- Yes!
Anu..
'You can change the
way people think.'
'But you..'
'You sing meaningless songs.'
Don't get married to me as a favour.
I don't want to force you into
sharing your life with me.
I love you, man.
Don't insult me like this.
'Your songs have no depth or poetry.'
'You should be ashamed of yourself.'
Are you upset because
of what Shashi said?
I don't want to sing.
That's all.
Don't worry.
I know what will help you
get into the mood.
Please leave.
I've heard that there's a new
girl at Banto's place.
Want to go there tonight?
What say?
Don't you understand what I'm saying?
Just leave me alone!
Okay, as you wish.
'Spring is here.'
'The gentle breeze..'
Excuse me, just a second.
Do you have that journal, Preetam?
- Of course. One minute.
Here you go.
But the poem is not here.
- Your poem?
Don't you know,
it hasn't been published this week?
And last week?
You must have the old issues, right?
Yes. Give me a minute.
Are the poems there?
- See for yourself.
Here.
"What I thought were stars"
"were tiny holes
in the fabric of the night."
"I managed to unstitch"
"and unravel"
"a corner of"
"the dark skies."
"And I realized that"
"it was your light"
"as bright as the sun"
"on the other side."
"On the other side."
I didn't write that.
I know.
You still don't get it,
do you, Phillauri?
I'm the other Phillauri
of this Phillaur village.
I wrote these poems.
"A prayer is flying in
every breath of mine."
"I am praying for you, my beloved."
"A prayer is flying in
every breath of mine."
"I am praying for you, my beloved."
"A prayer is flying in
every breath of mine."
"I am praying for you, my beloved."
"A prayer is flying in
every breath of mine."
"I am praying for you, my beloved."
"My heart has become an ascetic."
"My heart has become an ascetic."
"It has now started going
towards your abode."
"A prayer is flying in
every breath of mine."
"I am praying for you, my beloved."
"In every breath of mine.."
"In every breath of mine.."
"In every breath of mine.."
"A prayer in every breath of mine."
"Your eyes are like a book.
Open them and I shall read them."
"Your stories are printed in kohl."
"Your talks are as sweet as sugar,
I wish to taste them."
"They will melt slowly.
Permit me and I shall taste them."
"A prayer is flying in
every breath of mine."
"I am praying for you, my beloved."
"A prayer is flying in
every breath of mine."
"I am praying for you, my beloved."
"My heart has become an ascetic."
"My heart has become an ascetic."
"It has started going
towards your abode."
"A prayer is flying in
every breath of mine."
"I am praying for you, my beloved."
"A prayer is flying in
every breath of mine."
"I am praying for you, my beloved."
"My beloved, I've collected your
talks considering them my treasure."
"I've filled bowlfuls of
dreams and desires."
"I've coloured the sky
in your colour."
"A prayer is flying in
every breath of mine."
"I am praying for you, my beloved."
"I am praying for you, my beloved."
"I am praying for you, my beloved."
"A prayer in every breath of mine."
"In every breath of mine."
'He told me a tale'
'of a prince'
'who gallops on drum beats.'
'A war cry of heartbeats..'
'Watch his Cupid bow.'
'He will disarm you,
little princess.'
"A prayer.."
"A prayer in every breath of mine.."
"A prayer in every breath of mine.."
"A prayer in every breath of mine.."
"A prayer in every breath of mine.."
"A prayer in every breath of mine.."
"A prayer is flying in
every breath of mine."
"I am praying for you, my beloved."
"A prayer in every breath of mine.."
"A prayer in every breath of mine.."
"A prayer in every breath of mine.."
"A prayer in every breath of mine.."
"A prayer in every breath of mine.."
"A prayer.."
Do you remember the editor
Gurbaksh Singh's
open letter in the newspaper
asking Phillauri to disclose
his identity?
Yes.
- I sent a reply to him.
Really?
What did you write?
That you are the real Phillauri.
- What?
He's coming to Amritsar with the
people from the gramophone company.
They will release a record
of Phillauri's songs.
My words, your voice, your face.
Are you crazy?
- Why?
The record will
bear Phillauri's name.
And we're both Phillauris, aren't we?
Try and understand.
I'm not even allowed to
go up to Ludhiana.
It took me a lot of courage to write
and get these poems published.
Girls from respectable families
cannot get involved in such things.
You will go, won't you?
You are a poet, so intelligent.
I can't believe that you would
say such silly things.
Must be Soma. - At this hour?
- He comes over at odd hours.
Wait, I'll be there!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Brother!
- Kishanchand! You'll kill her!
Come with me!
Here, drink this.
It's turmeric milk.
Sister..
I've raised you like my daughter.
I educated you
so that you could read the Holy Book.
So that you can differentiate
right from wrong.
I didn't get married so that
I could give you all my love.
What did I do wrong
that you punished me like this?
He's not worthy of you.
He's worth nothing.
Girls like you don't get involved
with men like him.
Respectable people like us
don't get involved with
disreputable music and singers.
Drink this.
Enough, my dear.
Stop crying.
Anu.
Just two days to go for the wedding.
What has come over you now?
Please don't scold him, Dolly.
He will tell us if we ask him nicely.
Aren't we doing all this
for their happiness?
He's anything but happy.
- Anu, please let him speak.
Kanan, don't be scared.
Tell us what the problem is.
- Let me tell you.
He actually got married to me.
And then you got the tree cut down.
What do we do now?
- It's.. It's..
It's just too early. - What?
What is too early?
I just finished my studies.
Getting married at this age?
So when do you want to get married?
What is it that you want to do that
can't be done after marriage?
I.. I just..
I just need to find myself.
Well done! He's got his first
world issues to Amritsar.
Where exactly are you searching
for yourself?
What does he mean? You are
right here. - Should I help?
See..
This is you.
And here is Anu.
I've spent all my life here.
I didn't need to go anywhere
to find myself.
He doesn't know what he is saying.
You guys just don't get it!
- So explain! - So explain.
My dear, after marriage, you can
search.. - You're not getting it!
He is right.
We don't understand anything.
You both have been joined at
the hip since you were kids.
Both of you love each other.
- I love him, but he doesn't.
Don't you love her?
- Told you so many times, I do!
But you don't want to get married.
- I want to, I want to marry you.
Well, then the problem is solved.
Come on, hug each other.
Great, things are back on track now.
Well, problem sorted!
Let's go.
- Make yourself a drink.
Come on..
Let's go, Mother.
Let's get a glass. - Let's go.
I gave you a chance to call it off.
What more do you want?
Tell me.
But you are too scared, aren't you?
Philanderer..
Womaniser.. Alcoholic..
It's all true.
I'm all this and more.
I was all this and more.
Before I met Shashi.
How dare you enter my house!
I will kill you!
Don't you dare look at my sister!
You are right.
I am not worthy of her.
But I can try.
And I will be.
I am going to Amritsar.
To record the songs
written by Shashi.
You don't know, do you?
She is a poetess.
Nobody knows this.
Everybody in Punjab reads her poems.
But they don't know that
she is the poetess.
I will make sure she gets her due.
On Baisakhi
I'll ask you for her
hand in marriage.
Please take care of
Shashi till I return.
After that,
I'll take better care of her
than you ever could.
"I got entangled with you in a way"
"that every thread in
it was pulled back."
"I got entangled with you in a way"
"that every thread in
it was pulled back."
"Like in a saint's tomb,
shawl has been draped."
"It gets withered and
woven every day."
"I have written this story of love
again and again so many times."
"O Sahibaan.."
"Go where Mirza awaits you."
"O Sahibaan.."
"Go where Mirza awaits you."
Every girl dreams of this day.
I'm sure Anu has too.
Don't ruin it for her.
I'm trying to do what everybody
wants me to.
I'm trying to make everybody happy.
If you aren't happy,
how can you make others happy?
You are a man, so act like one.
I am about to spend the rest
of my life with her.
Of course, I'm scared. - Are you
scared of making a decision?
If you don't, you'll only regret it.
If you go ahead and get married
in spite of she being there
you'll be lonely, always.
"They were empty letters.
I cried and sent them to you"
"putting the stamps of love on them."
"The paper boat of
my love got drowned"
"in the river of tears."
"The unmelodious tune of my heart is
telling you something, listen to me."
"You are my mirror,
so why don't you recognise me?"
"You don't believe who I am.
Don't act like a stranger now."
"A cry of pain is
erupting from my heart."
"It is ringing like musical notes."
"In my breath,
you are like mellow tunes."
"Like few strands of saffron,
you got dissolved in it."
"I got lost."
"How come there is a faint
grey colour on my heart?"
"I got entangled with you in a way"
"that every thread in
it was pulled back."
"Like in a saint's tomb,
shawl has been draped."
"It gets withered
and woven every day."
"I have written this story of love
again and again so many times."
"O Sahibaan.."
"Go where Mirza awaits you."
I pray to thee, Mother..
I pray to thee, Mother..
"O Sahibaan.."
"O Sahibaan,
I got wounded due to the separation."
"O Sahibaan,
my heart has become a rebel."
"Stubbornness has crossed
all limits."
"My tongue chants your name non-stop.
Without you.."
"Without you,
my breath is pricking me."
"Without you,
my life seems worthless."
"Without you,
my breath is pricking me."
"Without you,
my life seems worthless."
Straighten your hand.
Greetings.
- Greetings.
There's a letter for the doctor
and some money too.
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Rs. 300.
- Who has sent it?
Roop Lal Phillauri.
That's a lot of money, doctor.
My tip?
Baisakhi is around the corner.
I was wrong.
You had asked him to do this,
hadn't you?
You would've remained in the shadows
and he could've become famous
and made a lot of money.
But he didn't do that.
He is worthy of you.
He values and respects you.
How can I refuse to let my
sister marry such a man?
He will be here on Baisakhi.
Your groom.
This brother of yours will
give you away in style.
Oh, brother..
My child.
Anu..
Anu..
Anu..
Anu..
Why does everybody
keep fainting in this house?
What did you do?
I was only trying to help.
- I can see that.
Anu..
Anu..
It's okay, it's all right, chill.
Relax..
It's okay. chill,
chill.. Hey, it's okay.
Anu, calm down. Calm down.
She's harmless.
It's all right. It's all right.
Anu.. Anu, it's all right.
Wh.. Wha..
You are lucky you can
only see the veil.
Think of how scared I have been.
I can see the ghost.
Why can't I see her?
Well, I'm married to her, so
only I can see her.
You didn't want to marry me,
but you went and married a ghost?
I didn't do it purposely.
It just happened.
If we hadn't gone to the tree, we
wouldn't have gotten into this mess.
Marrying you would get
anyone into a mess.
Baby, don't say that.
I'm sorry, I was confused.
I'll fix everything.
Does this ghost have a name?
Shashi.
Shashi?
Come on, relax.
She won't hurt you.
Calm down. Come on.
Nothing will happen.
Nothing will happen.
She dresses a little scantily,
but the girl is nice.
She likes you.
- What? - She likes you.
Thank you.
- There..
Why are you here?
- Didn't I tell you, the tree..
I don't know why I am stuck here.
She doesn't know.
Did you have any unfinished business?
Something you needed to do?
Maybe.
"The festival of happiness, Baisakhi,
is going to be here."
Greetings.. - "It's a festival of
colours and sweets."
"The auspicious day is here, come,
the courtyard is decorated."
"I met my soulmate.
Congratulate me for that."
"He'll come to me with
a wedding procession."
"I met my soulmate."
What had I stolen from you that
you stole Phillauri from me?
You used to sing his praises
all the time, I fell in love.
Fell in love?
You broke my heart.
Listen, what's the time?
This is the twentieth time you are
asking me. It's 11 o'clock.
What's wrong?
Can't wait, you shameless hussy?
Granny's here.
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Congratulations.
May God bless you.
Greetings.
Put the flowers up properly!
- Sure.
What's wrong, Shashi?
You fell sick.
You've been restless all morning.
Wait, I'll call your brother.
What happened?
Yuck! Disgusting!
- Shut up!
Did you do it with him?
Didn't you feel shy?
What! I'm going to be an aunt!
Shashi!
"The festival of happiness, Baisakhi,
is going to be here."
"It's a festival of colours
and sweets."
"Your stubbornness and
tantrums are to die for."
"Your veil and the dress
you wear is beautiful."
"The auspicious day has arrived,
come, the courtyard is decorated."
"My soulmate."
God bless you.
Phillauri hasn't arrived yet.
Don't worry.
He must have missed the train.
The next train is in the evening.
I'm sure he'll be on it.
I will be there to receive him.
All right?
You are looking beautiful.
Greetings..
Amrit!
Amrit!
Yes?
I'm going to the railway
station to pick him up.
You take care of everything here.
Okay?
"I won't go until I hear
the wedding bells."
"Dresses of various colours."
"Tell me everything."
Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.
There is a doctor in Lahore
from a good family.
I'll send him a telegram tomorrow.
Lahore is very far from here.
Nobody will know about your past.
That you were disgracefully
left at the altar.
"O' Lord..
Answer me."
"What does one do when she"
"faces such injustice."
"What happens when someone
shows such false hopes?"
"One becomes a body"
"without soul.."
Are you mad?
Nobody is worth dying for.
He took advantage of you.
He used your poetry.
This is how he paid you back.
But he had sent some money.
He sent her money.
He had gone to Amritsar, right?
When?
In April.
- This year? Or the last..
I don't know. I can't really tell
how much time has passed.
Which year is this?
- 2017.
98 years..
98 years, man..
98 years!
What?
98?
Then why?
Why am I here?
Hey, groom!
You..
You're in the bedroom already?
You can't wait, can you?
Anu's grandfather was just like you.
See..
He had given this to me
on our wedding day.
Here.
This might break, you might lose it
but his love will be there forever.
Just like Kanan's love for you.
Isn't it, my dear?
You look so beautiful.
Just like an angel.
Kanan..
Don't you have something
to say to your bride?
I was living in a
half-remembered dream.
And you brought me to my senses.
Idiot, say it to her.
I was living in a half-remembered
dream.
And you brought me to my senses.
You are my truth.
And I bow down to you.
You are my truth.
And I bow down to you.
Don't abandon me, dear heart.
I am nothing without you.
Don't abandon me, dear heart.
I am nothing without you.
Dear heart..
This pain of separation wounds me.
Dear heart..
This pain of separation wounds me.
"It urges me to rebel."
"Dear heart.."
"This pain of separation wounds me.."
How does she know this poem?
Grandma, which song are you singing?
It's from my favourite record,
my dear.
"Dear heart.."
Can you show it to me, please?
Where is it?
Here.
Here it is.
'The record will have
both our names.'
'The one who sang'
'and the one who wrote.'
Both the Phillauris.
1919?
So long ago?
What a terrible year.
With that inauspicious Baisakhi day.
But today,
we will not talk about all that.
Today, we will have a happy Baisakhi.
It was Baisakhi.
The day he was supposed to
return from Amritsar.
Amritsar..
Baisakhi..
Baisakhi?
Amritsar, 1919.
Shashi.
Please call the bride and groom.
- Yes.
Anu!
Kanan, where are you going?
Anu!
- Anu!
Anu, where are you going?
- Wait!
Wait.. Anu!
- Wait..
Where are you going?
- Come..
Anu, where..
Anu..
- Where are you going?
Where are we going?
What is happening, Kanan?
You have no idea, right?
How would you know?
Killed yourself like a fool.
Everybody knows
what happened
in Amritsar on Baisakhi, in 1919.
What?
"What happens when
your past haunts you.."
"You are left
with no option"
"but to seek solace from God!"
"O' Lord, be auspicious unto me.."
"O' Lord, be auspicious unto me.."
Thank you, sir.
I'll never forget what
you've done for Shashi and me.
What are you saying, dear?
I am the lucky one. I got to make
this record for both of you.
I'll take your leave now.
But there's still some
time before your train leaves.
Why don't you do something?
I'm going to a gathering nearby.
Come with me.
And leave in time for your train.
Come on.
Okay.
"When your past stands
face to face with your present."
"One cannot help but delve
in the horrific past."
"But then the Lord is by your side,
you need not worry."
"Let your faith in the Almighty
not get shattered."
"All your sorrows will fade away
if you are devoted enough."
"And success will kiss your feet."
"Take the Lord's name and embark
on your journey."
"And you are sure to be
successful in your endeavour."
Fire!
Shashi.
Is he here?
So many people.
I just took a chance.
I thought it was on this day..
An unfolding of love.
Like unfurling of wings.
Love flies
in like a beautiful phoenix.
Disruptive. Breaking the dawn
with the edge of its beak.
I have coaxed it to stay.
Fattened on sugar drops.
From the tip of my tongue.
I am hoping it will murmur my name.
Remember me in the bird song.
They say it pierces its heart
They say it pierces its heart
on the thorns of roses.
And blood blossoms
as eternal spring.
Won't you slap me today?
Take care of each other.
Forever.
Forever!
So, this is what forever means.
I can try.
That's good enough.
That's more than enough for me.
