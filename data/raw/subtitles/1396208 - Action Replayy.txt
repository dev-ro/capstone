Bunty.
- Yes, sweetie.
This is for you.
How sweet, Tanya!
Red heart-shaped box. Very nice.
Bunty, will you marry me?
Isn't that your
favorite question, Tanya?
Why do you scare me
each time by asking this?
What there to be scared of?
And if l wanted to scare you..
..l would've said "Please marry me,
I'm pregnant with your child".
That would've been better.
Less scary.
Listen, sweetie, we can live
together if we want.
Live-in is fine.
We can be partners.
But no Mr. and Mrs.
And no marriage.
I have promised grandpa..
..that l will get
married and only with you.
Then you can't fulfill your
promise in this lifetime, Tanya.
Bunty, marriage is an institution.
It's a mental institution, Tanya.
And the living
examples are my parents.
Marriage is 'the end' of love,
Tanya.. - Bunty..
And you will know what
I am talking about..
..once you meet my
mother and father.
1 0.
- 1 3.
1 0.
- 1 1 .
1 0, that's all. 1 0.
Sir, everyday you
buy dozens of goods.
And haggle for just Rs.50 a dozen.
It's a long story.
- How long?
Its 5ft 7 inches long.
People normally get married to shy,
demure and virtuous girls.
But I.. married a spendthrift girl.
She has changed the
meaning of 'spending' altogether.
She spends my money like water.
Sometimes she shops for so long..
..that she takes a
blanket and a pillow..
..and sleeps in the Home
Department of the mall..
..so that she can get up again
in the morning and start shopping.
I've finished
shopping for small things.
Now the real shopping..
I will do it tomorrow.
Not just that.
If the stereo of the car has some
problem.. - She buys a new stereo.
No, she buys a new car.
And look.
Do you see this dress?
Its worth 250,000 rupees.
She says that Mallika Sherawat
wore this dress in 'Murder'.
What do you say?
Mallika Sherawat wore
a dress in 'Murder'?
When?
- That's exactly what I say.
That's why I come here all
the way from Lokhandwala..
..to buy cheap fruits.
Brother, l pray that
even Osama Bin Laden..
..doesn't have a wife like yours.
Oh God!
You intentionally ruined the dress.
Mala, why would l do such a thing?
Because you don't
want me to look nice.
That isn't possible anyway.
Whether l do anything or not
won't make a difference. - Really?
Then why did..
- l marry you.
Tell me, why did you marry me.
Don't taunt me every now and then.
Anyone can make a mistake.
Yes, just like your parents made.
You.
Mind your tongue.
Or else?
- Or else. - Yes.
Or else..
- Or else what?
Hey, get back to work all of you.
Get to work.
Bhikhu, you work as well.
I should do all the work.
Why don't l just fire you?
People get motorcycle in dowry..
..but what did l get?
This servant. Who can't do a thing?
Be thankful that you
at least got that.
Come on, stop it.
What is this?
It took you 20 years
to fulfill your dream.
To turn hotel Suryaprakash
into Bollywood Cafe. For this?
So that you can use every
corner of this hotel to argue.
For God's sake.. even
your staff laughs at you.
'God, please show me a way..'
'..to stop mom and
dad's arguments forever.'
Why did you bring me here, Tanya?
So that you can explain
my grandpa..
..why you're allergic to marriage?
Come on.
- l see.
Call him, call him. Where is he?
I even have a fresh matter today.
I will call him.
Grandpa. Grandpa.
Tanya, hi!
You didn't tell me that your
grandpa is Albert Einstein.
Shut up, okay?
My grandpa means everything to me.
1 8 years ago when there was
an earthquake in lndonesia..
..my mom, dad..
- Do all scientists..
..get their haircut
in the same saloon?
I will kill you, Bunty. Come on.
Grandpa.
How is my baby? Come on.
Grandpa, he's Bunty.
I am Gonsalves.
Anthony Gonsalves.
- Hello, sir!
Sir, what is this?
This. This is a time machine.
A machine that will
connect us with our past..
..and make our future better.
A machine that will
break the sound barrier..
..and take us back,
I mean to our past.
Time machine?
Professor, they are
made only in films.
How can you make a time
machine in real life, professor?
It can be made, we
can make, we can make..
If we can see the past..
..then we can also
travel to the past.
Think logically. Because logically..
- Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa.
What's this! You were supposed
to explain Bunty about..
..marriage and not logic.
Don't change the topic, Tanya.
Sir, you were saying
something very important.
Please go ahead.
We can..
- Yes, yes.
We can see the Alpha
Century (a planet)..
..which is four
light years away from us.
We don't look at it
the way we should.
But we look at it just as
it looked four years ago.
Correct?
- Correct.
The star called Turios that we see.
We see it like it
was nine years ago.
We don't watch it..
By the way.. do you watch
your face in the mirror?
Yes, every hour.
- That isn't fresh either.
It is also 1 0 nanoseconds old.
Tell me.. if you get a
chance to go back to the past..
..which mistake would you
like to stop from happening?
My mom and dad's marriage.
Yes, Grandpa, this is
the topic. Marriage.
Now ask him why he
doesn't want to marry me.
Yes, why don't you
want to get married?
I am scared.
It's just an excuse.
If you have the
courage to fall in love..
..then you should be
ready for marriage as well.
Logically you should marry Tanya..
..or stop seeing her.
Don't spoil her life.
Think logically and tell me
before 12 O'clock tomorrow night.
Because after 12 O'clock l
am going on a test ride..
..in my past.
Professor, l don't
have time to think..
..because tomorrow is my
parent's 35th anniversary.
And l have planned a
surprise party for them.
Everyone must be
thinking looking at you..
..that why hasn't her
husband gone bankrupt yet.
You look like
Zhaveri Bazaar's showroom.
It's better than looking like an
antique piece in the flea market.
How much she loves me!
How much she loves me!
Enjoy the party, guys! Go on.
Excuse me, get me a drink please.
I should do all the work?
Uncle Bhikhu, were mom
and dad always like this..
..or did this happen
after marriage?
They were always sworn enemies.
Their marriage is
the biggest mistake..
..in the history of mankind..
..since the invention of atom bomb.
Well, actually it
wasn't their mistake..
..but it was your
grandpa's and grandma's.
How is that?
They're dead and all that's
left are their photographs.
But they still don't like
standing next to each other.
Your grandpa Rai
Bahadur Dhyanchand.
No one ever took his Rai (advice)
nor was he Bahadur (brave).
Especially in front
of your grandma.
And your grandma Bholi Devi.
She was neither Bholi (innocent)
nor was she a Devi (Goddess).
Wonder why they got
their children married..
..and sent me here as the dowry?
"lf l had wings,
I would soar high."
"l would show you the
anguish in my heart."
Here he comes,
the great two-in-one.
Two-in-one?
- Yes, Kundan Lal.
He's a singer, sings in two voices.
Male and female.
- What?
Kitchen Kumar.. how are you?
Where did you get these
new set of teeth from?
Kundan, what a surprise!
Mala.
Bhikhu.
Where did this duet come from?
I didn't know that
Kundan is coming.
How are you, brother Kundan?
Mala. Kishen.
- Mona.
I am no longer Mona,
but Ma Jogeshwari.
That's the name of
a railway station.
Since when?
How did you stay with
Kitchen Kumar for so long?
What can l do?
I thought about it many times.
But it's not right to throw
the master out of the house.
What?
Who is he?
Kundan, he's my son.
Bunty.
But he looks handsome.
Like father like son.
You?
You look handsome?
- l was joking.
You only look.
And that's regretting as well.
Son, there was a time when your
father would do cabaret for me.
What? Dad, really?
- l see.
Seems like dear dad has
kept secrets from you.
What do you mean?
He means.. Kundan,
show him how sir dances.
Should l show you?
- Kitchen Kumar.
That's a great shirt, Kishen.
- Don't say a word about my shirt.
What are you doing?
Everyone is watching us.
Come on, dad, do something.
Just joking, we are old friend.
Come on. - Now watch the fun.
Your shirt is looking nice.
Hey, stop it!
- Kishen.
Come on. - We were kids then.
What are you doing?
Leave me. Leave me.
Kundan.
You saw that?
Kundan is just a friend.
I never thought
about him in that way.
Mom, dad, at least
don't fight tonight.
Bunty, who would you prefer
to stay with? - Katrina Kaif.
Bunty, l am talking about we two.
I am divorcing your mother.
That's a lie.
Actually l am divorcing him.
Very good, very good.
You guys have fun, l am leaving.
Bunty. Bunty.
Friends.
To make this celebration of a
34 year old mistake memorable..
..l request Mr. Kundan Lal
to sing a song in two voices.
Come, come.
Ladies and gentlemen.
I made this song about my dear
friend Mala's marriage with Kishen.
So can we change the mood now?
Clap!
When my mom and dad
didn't have any love story..
..then what was the
theme of the song?
Which song would suit
such unromantic couple?
How would they both
look singing together?
"What a terrible blunder!"
"Marriage turned into a nightmare."
"lt's a bundle of grief."
"lt's after your life."
"lt's better to die than marrying."
"lt's the reason for all sorrows."
"What a terrible blunder."
"When you're attending a marriage."
"Always advice him."
"Don't get married."
"lt's dreadful."
"Don't regret it later."
"Here's your chance."
"Run away now."
"Pacify your heart
that's eager for marriage."
"Run away from the marriage dais."
"What a terrible blunder."
"The person that.. got
married first in the world."
"Catch him, thrash him."
"He's responsible for the mistake."
"The person that.. got
married first in the world."
"Catch him, thrash him."
"He's responsible for the mistake."
"He was stupid."
"He was cruel and ruined others."
"Kill him cruelly."
"What a terrible blunder."
"Marriage turned into a nightmare."
"What a terrible blunder."
I would've never married you..
..if mother hadn't forced me.
You've always been the
biggest bore in the world.
You don't have any style of
speaking, no personality and..
..your clothes.. - Don't say
anything about the clothes, Mala.
Don't you dare say
anything about them!
No one washes clothes like l
do in the entire Lokhandwala.
I am talking about the clothes
you wear, not about your washing.
And after my death this
is what you would say..
Buy a plain cloth
to cover her body.
Oh no, l know you will
stand up, throw a tantrum.
'Couldn't you get a shroud
made of Kanjivaram silk?'
Exactly, you didn't give me
anything while l am alive.
I will definitely ask
for something after l die.
I didn't give you anything
as long as you were alive?
What did you give me?
Did you even buy me a dog?
All our neighbors have dogs.
But we don't.
I am there.
Then why do you need a dog for
the safety of the house, madam?
At least the dog
will keep me company.
It will go along with me.
Didn't l ever go out with you?
- When did you?
When did you ever take me out?
Should l remind you?
On our honeymoon.
And l thought we'll go to Kashmir,
Kulu Manali, or Shimla.
But where did you take me?
- Hubli.
And only because you were getting
someone's bungalow for free.
Kishen, you never
cared about my feelings.
Never took me to a movie or dinner,
picnic was farfetched of course..
You never said
anything romantic to me.
You need two hands to clap, Mala.
You hated me before the
marriage and also after.
I don't try to keep
myself busy with the..
..restaurant business for no reason.
I didn't go shopping
without any reason.
Kishen, if l am a shopaholic today..
..then you're the reason for it.
Because l tried to find happiness..
..in these jewelry,
clothes and shoes.
But now l have realized..
..that l will never find
that happiness in all this.
You found that out after spending
9,35,33,31 5 rupees of mine?
No, after wasting 12,054 days
and 23 1/2 hours of my life.
Dad.
Mom. Mom.
Dad. Mom.
Mom. Dad.
Mom. Dad. Mom.
God.
I will never let you two separate.
Never.
I know l am going
to do a crazy thing.
But there's no other
way to stop this divorce.
To change their present..
..l will have to change their past.
Professor.
So you're finally here.
Well, young man, so what have
you decided about marrying Tanya?
Professor, l have a one request.
Request?
Where do you want to go?
Fortune town, 1 975.
Is that your birth year?
My parents weren't
even married then.
What's the connection
between marriage and birth?
City, Mumbai.
I mean it was Bombay then.
Don't touch anything.
- No.
Especially this red button.
If you touch it, the machine
will switch to flying mode.
Get it.
Remember, don't touch anything.
Careful.
Hey!
O my God!
I said don't touch the red button.
Try to stop it now. - Grandpa.
Try to switch it off, Bunty.
Press the blue button.
At least hear how
you've to come back.
Forget, Bunty.
You can never marry him now.
I am coming, mom, I am coming, dad.
Stop! Stop!
Professor!
Time Machine! Professor!
What Professor?
Suryaprakash restaurant.
Grandpa's restaurant.
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!
The India Pakistan
war has started again.
Rai Bahadur versus Bholi Devi.
Grandpa (paternal),
grandma (maternal).
Grandpa.
How dare you cut the
branch of my tree?
Who gave you the permission?
Couldn't you find any
other tree for burning Holi?
I'll not spare you people today!
Let my son come here.
Your son?
You call the
delicate flower your son?
And what will he do?
Will he stick the branches
back to the tree? lsn't it?
He's very strong.
- l see.
He can uproot the whole tree..
..and plant it back in his house.
I will shoot you today..
Why shoot us?
You have an atom bomb.
- Where is it?
Here it is.
- Here.
Here.
- Wait.
Kishen.
- Dad.
Kishen, give me my gun.
Who are you?
- Your father, you fool.
Dad. - Sorry, father, l
couldn't recognize your voice.
But I instantly recognized you..
..when you called me 'fool'.
Stop blabbering and pass me my gun.
- Here it is, father.
Careful, father.
Wait there.
Stand just like that,
one behind the other.
I will need only
one bullet that way.
Let me see who saves you two today.
I will save them.
Grandma.
Careful, grandma.
This glass piece might've hurt you.
Rai Bahadur, what's going on?
Why are you scaring
these innocent children?
Innocent children?
Look, what they've
done to my plants.
I know. l made
them cut the branches.
Why did you cut the branches?
What right do you have?
These trees are mine. - Quiet!
There's no need to get angry..
..for just few branches, get that.
"My tree, my groves."
Even birds don't make
their nests on these trees.
And by growing roses
under the plum tree..
..do you want to grow
some new kind of plant?
You shouldn't be concerned
with what l do with them.
This is my property.
And this bungalow that you've
seized.. - What did you say?
That belongs to me as well. Yes.
I will have you
thrown out of this house.
I know lndira very well now.
I will get an
emergency declared on you.
That's going to be declared
three months later, grandpa.
Grandpa? Who are you?
I have a wonderful idea to
give them a fitting reply, father.
Rogues, watch now.
Just watch.
What are you doing?
Now you will know what
my son is capable of.
Oh.. no!
He's my dad? He's quite different.
You threw a balloon at my father?
My soft, innocent and..
Stop praising me.
And give them a
fitting reply. - Yes.
What was that?
Is that your fitting reply?
Father, l think the
water pressure was low.
Father. Father.
You're fool.
That's a nice shirt, Kishen.
Kundan, please leave me.
Bhikhu, take his shirt off.
- Will l have to do all the work?
No, Kundan, let me go.
Don't tear my clothes.
Mala's gang is here.
We'll deal with you later.
Bhikhu, let's go.
Mala.
Are you okay?
Are you alright?
Those idiots stepped on me.
Who are you?
I will tell you later. Bye.
Mother is here.
Mother is here?
"l kept smouldering all day,
it's surprising."
"The fire is still alive,
it's surprising."
"l kept smouldering all day,

"The fire is still alive,

Gonsalves. Gonsalves. Gonsalves.
Gonsalves.
Yes. Anthony Gonsalves.
Did l really make this?
I don't believe it.
I can't believe that l made this.
The way it has landed..
..l am completely
sure you've made it.
What did you say?
That's why, professor..
..only you can tell
me how l can go back.
But why did you come here?
You mean to say..
..you came here to make
your parents fall in love.
What a rotten idea!
It's a stupid idea.
- You gave me that idea.
Professor, can you
lend me some money?
How much do you want?
Professor, you're a rich man,
whatever you can spare.
For Tanya.
- For Tanya.
Give me tea and bread.
"Julie.. Brother Kundan."
"l love you."
"Julie.. Brother Kundan."
Brother Kundan, do you want to
stay unmarried all your life?
Have you ever thought
about love, marriage, girls..
..or will I have to
do that as well?
I did.
I was in love.
- l see.
Three times.
The first time..
I love you, Kamla.
I want to marry you.
What, love marriage?
Result..
We believe that a boy and girl..
..can have only one
relation willingly.
And that's Raksha Bandhan.
So what if I wasn't
successful the first time?
But I still desired
for love-marriage.
Here's my wedding card.
She handed me the card
to her arranged marriage.
The third time l
went up to the temple..
..for the love marriage.
But I was slightly late.
No!
When love marriage isn't possible..
..then what's the
point of falling in love?
Here, keep the glass.
And don't forget to pay him.
Fool. - Yes.
What are you doing?
Father, l am frying fritters.
Here. Keep 1 0 rupees.
For the household expenses.
And if anything happens to
the rose plants in my absence..
..then I will send you to hell.
But, father, how is that possible?
Quiet, fool!
How many times have l said..
..keep the engine on!
That heroine will come any moment.
- Where do you want to go?
All India Radio.
- Yes, madam.
What "Yes, madam"!
I want to go to the VT Station.
Fine, driver.
You can drop him at VT Station..
..but first take me to All
India Radio. And let's go.
But I am in a hurry,
this is my car. - Quiet!
Come on. Fast.
Today Kitchen Kumar is in trouble.
Now watch what l will do. Come on.
Come on.
Hello. - Who is it? Kishen?
Yes, who is this?
This is.. aunt Jamuna.
Yes, hello, aunt Jamuna.
Where are you speaking from?
You fool, pick up the pots.
Pick up the plants.
Should l do all the work?
- No.
I should pick up the plants
and talk to you? - Yes, Kishen.
Pick up the plants and speak.
I think aunt has gone crazy.
Pick this.
How is it?
- Aunt, it's heavy.
It will do. - Aunt, where are
you speaking from?
Where do l stay?
- Jaipur, aunt.
So I am speaking from Jaipur.
But your voice sounds so clear.
So why are you yelling, you fool?
Aunt, father has said..
..that we should speak
louder in a trunk call.
He's a fool.
Maybe you might know better.
But he will kill me.
If he misbehaves..
..then kick him out of the house.
But.. aunt, won't that
be a bit too much? - No.
He drives my mother crazy.
But isn't your mother dead?
I am talking about my mother.
Don't you and father
have the same mother?
No. No.
He's the servant's son.
After the servant died
my mother raised him.
What? My father is
the servant's son?
That means l am a
servant's grandchild.
Ask Bhikhu.
Bhikhu knows about it.
- Yes.
Bhikhu is your father's brother.
The servant of my cruel,
lowly, roguish neighbors..
..is my uncle?
Kishen, aren't you ashamed
to abuse your neighbors?
Why shouldn't l,
aunt, why shouldn't I?
The mother's a witch,
the daughter's a spectre.
You know, last month..
..they pulled down
my father's loincloth.
Do you know that?
I laughed watching the scene.
Aunt, you laughed too.
But aunt, he's my father..
..even if he's a servant's son.
Aunt.. how is uncle Popat? - Popat?
Popat.. flew away.
- What?
Let it be, there are others.
Others? Others at this age?
This is the age to enjoy.
What's the name of the other uncle?
Bull.
- Bull?
Bull.
After popat (parrot) now it's bull.
Bull?
There are two.
You're with two?
Bhikhu, Kundan, run!
Bhikhu? Kundan?
Thieves! Thieves!
My father's plants!
This one's broken as well. Thieves!
Catch them! Catch the thieves!
Catch them!
What have you done, Mala?
My father asked me
to protect the plants.
My father will burn me alive.
There's no need for that.
Because there's something
going to happen to you..
..after which you
will die out of shame.
What did you say
about us on the phone?
Ghost. Witch.
Today we'll make your plight such..
..that you will become a laughing
stock in this neighborhood.
What do you mean?
I mean.. Kundan.
We mean.. that day we
pulled your father's loincloth..
..and today it's your turn.
No, Kundan.
Kundan, please.
Kundan, look..
Kundan, it'll tear off.
It's okay.
- Mala, please tell them.
Kundan, be careful.
Kitchen Kumar is very delicate.
Mala, be scared of the Lord.
Leave me.
Mala.
Where are my roses?
The roses were getting dry.
So I made a paste out of them.
Where's the paste?
I.. l.. it was
mother's anniversary..
..so l fed the paste to mother..
No, to the bull.
If it was mother's anniversary..
..then you should've fed the
paste to the cow or the bull?
The cow.
- So?
I didn't realize whether
it was a cow or a bull.
Why?
Was the bull wearing pants
that you couldn't find out?
You fool.
Go and get betel leaf for me.
I am in the mood
for betel leaf today.
Father, money?
I gave you 1 0 rupees in the morning.
I.. lent it.. to a friend?
At what interest rate?
- One..
One percent.
None.
If you don't get the
money within 24 hours..
..then I will recover
the money by selling you?
But father, who will buy me?
Quiet. Get out.
Idiot. Fool.
Who are you?
1 0 rupees.
And 50 paisa interest.
But how can l take this?
I can't accept this.
- Keep it.
Everything l own
belongs to you as well as me.
No, no, no, no, no..
You shouldn't touch
my feet, da.. Kishen.
I suggest you come to
my restaurant with me.
I will treat you to a cup of tea.
Or let's go to my home.
I'll prepare mango juice for you.
That's the problem, Kishen.
You don't have to
make mango juice. - Why?
I helped you, didn't l?
- Yes.
So what can you do for me?
Shall l give my life?
- No, no.
Yes, l can give my life.
No, no, no.
- l will do it.
Kishen.
Listen.
You will have to
do me a small favor.
Yes, tell me.
Remember, Mala.. Mala..
That witch Mala.
Yes, that witch Mala..
You will have to..
- What?
I've to treat her to mango juice?
- No, no, no.
You've to make her.. fall.
She's already a fallen girl.
How lower do you
want me to push her?
No, no, l don't mean it literally.
How do l explain to you?
Yes.
You've to..
..do gulu-gulu with her.
Gulu-gulu? - Gulu-gulu.
Oh God!
How do l explain it to him?
Yes. Watch, watch.
Okay.
Look, this is you.
And this is Mala.
And this is..
Gulu-gulu. Gulu.
And this is me.
Here's your money.
I would rather die..
than do this.. with Mala.
Kishen. Kishen.
You're trying to
ruin my life, Kishen.
Kishen! lf you make
Mala fall for you..
..then I will give you 5,000 rupees.
I made a bet with my friends..
..that you can make
Mala fall for you.
And if that happens..
..then I will win the
bet of 1 0,000 rupees.
And l will give you 5,000 rupees.
Think, Kishen, you can fulfill
your dreams with that money.
Your dream to turn
Suryaprakash restaurant..
..into a trendy hotel.
What will I have to do?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, come on.
Okay. Let's start.
First, try to imagine Mala's face..
Mala, no, no..
- Please.
Please.
Just try to see Mala's
face in your mind. That's all.
'Mala!'
That girl looks
dangerous even in my dreams.
She's a cannibal.
Kishen. Kishen. Kishen. Kishen.
But why don't you like Mala?
How can l?
Shameless girl.
She holds my hand publicly.
If any girl.. if any girl holds
my hand l don't like that at all.
You don't like it when
girls hold your hand?
I don't.
- ls everything fine, Kishen?
What do you mean?
I mean..
Yes. When you would
sit down to study..
..would any
thought cross your mind..
..that would deviate
your concentration?
Yes. That often happens with me.
Thank God.
Bunty, whenever l
sit down to study..
..l start wondering..
- What do you wonder, Kishen?
What, Kishen..
- Yes.
I wonder that.. if I don't
find brinjal in the market..
..how will l make brinjal roast.
Like, if l get loose motions..
- No, no, no, no, no.
I mean thoughts that..
Try to understand.
I am teaching you things..
..that you should be teaching me.
Bunty, l understand slightly.
I do now.
You mean..
I am taking nuptial rounds.
And instead of
concentrating on the marriage..
..l am watching the sun.
- What do you mean?
I mean when will the sun
sets and when I would go and..
Yes. Yes.
Thank God, everything's fine.
Now you've got to have
similar feelings for Mala.
Have you ever seen Mala closely?
I mean like that.
Like that?
You mean in an adult way?
O God! l mean with love.
Her innocence, her poise, her grace.
The poor girl has no one
else other than her mother.
I know.
- And poor Bholi Devi.
She goes to All lndia Radio
and sings to make a living.
What does she sing?
"My country is dearest to me."
"l can sacrifice
everything for my motherland."
"My country is dearest to me."
Oh, God.
- That's why.
Who is there to protect
Mala and teach her things?
Who?
- Who?
Who?
- lt's you. You.
I will explain Mala.
- So let's go.
I will show you how innocent,
delicate and graceful Mala is.
Let's go, Kishen.
Bunty, just a minute.
Bunty, slow down.
- Come on.
Bunty!
- Oh!
Not today, Kishen.
Not today.
- Why, what's wrong today?
It's dark, so the innocence on
her face won't be visible properly.
Bunty, let's try once.
My heart says. Just once.
Such eagerness, Kishen..
No, let's watch it tomorrow,
Kishen. - Come on.
Three, Kalbadevi.
Tell me something.
What is your opinion about Kishen?
- Very bad.
Hatred is not good, Mala.
What should I do?
My blood begins to
boil when l hear his name.
I want to..
- Let me be born, Mother.
What?
What kind of a girl are you?
You don't have any grace,
innocence or poise.
Grace. Poise. lnnocence.
What is that?
These are the things that
can help a girl become a model.
That means you can
never become a model, Mala.
No, l can't become one.
Because l don't want to be one.
Why should l take up modeling?
To become rich.
To be famous. But
you can't become one.
I was a fool to place a
bet for 1 0,000 rupees..
..that Mala can be a model.
But now l will lose.
I thought l will
give you half the money.
Sad.
I can try for 5,000 rupees.
She, a model?
What kind of a model?
- Model for soaps.
And what will she say?
'lf you don't wash
your clothes with 501 ..'
'..I will beat you up.'
Good one.
- Point to be noted, Mala.
You should behave like a simple,
innocent lndian woman..
And like a goon or hooligan.
You've to be very delicate,
very shy.
I got it.
I've to be like.. Kishen.
"My love, don't make
me restless anymore."
"l've been mesmerized by your love."
"My love, don't make
me restless anymore."
"l've been mesmerized by your love."
"l've been mesmerized."
"My love.. l am restless, eager."
"My eyes.. search for you."
"Where are you?"
"Let me dwell you in my eyes."
"My love.. l am restless, eager."
"l will love you beyond limits."
"l will hum tunes of your love."
"My love, don't make
me restless anymore."
"l've been mesmerized by your love."
"l've been mesmerized."
"l am beauty, l am bliss."
"You're the radiance in my heart."
"l am the flame."
"l burn only for you."
"l can wait for you all my life."
"Every moment's filled with agony."
"Whenever you're not around."
"When we meet.."
"..the events
planned for us will begin."
"Without you life's meaningless."
"When l find you l will
hide you from the world."
"My love, don't make
me restless anymore."
"l've been mesmerized by your love."
"My love, don't make
me restless anymore."
"l've been mesmerized by your love."
"l've been mesmerized."
"l've been mesmerized by your love."
"l've been mesmerized."
- Kishen.
Kishen, it's not right to
touch my feet, try to understand.
Bunty, you were right.
I was the fool.
Mala is a virtuous girl.
And l was so wrong about her.
Bunty, l am in love with Mala.
I didn't know that
she's a doll and not a don.
She's so delicate.
I will marry Mala.
The first love
marriage of our neighborhood.
And no one can stop me
from creating history.
No one.
There are already so many
problems in this love story..
..and now this triangle..
If he tries to woo Mala, then
how will l come into existence?
And what about me?
God.
Rajesh Khanna is married, Mala.
Girls are ready to be his mistress.
They write letters to
him with their blood..
..and tell him about their love.
Today even l..
- Stop this madness.
You know he will even have
two daughters in future.
By the way, Mala,
I know a nice boy.
And you will like him.
I see.
He's rich. He's slightly educated.
And his looks
aren't that bad either.
The most important fact is that..
..he will always care for you.
He will support you all your life.
He will look after you.
Who is he?
Kishen.
Ladies and gentlemen, did
you hear what Bunty said?
Mala.
- Kishen will look after me.
He will take care of me.
That fool can't take
care of himself and..
Mala, he has changed.
He has become very brave.
I see. Then..
I am ready to elope with him
and get married. - Really?
I will be his slave.
You're not serious, Mala.
He has to do just one thing.
- He will, done.
He will have to hold my
hand publicly and say..
Mala, l want to marry you.
Oh no!
He will.
Kishen will say it.
He has completely changed.
- Let him.
He will do it, Mala, he will do it.
Kishen will do it.
He will have to say it.
And if he doesn't say it
then l will beat you up.
He will do it, Mala. - Kishen
has become very brave. - Yes, yes.
I will go and talk
to him right now.
Come out, Kishen.
I am not coming out.
Look, Kishen, it's the
question if your honor now.
I value my life more
than my honor, Bunty.
That woman will make
mincemeat out of me.
I did not want to do this, Kishen.
I did not want to do this.
I did not want to do this
- No! No!
And if you don't win this bet..
..then I will make
mincemeat out of you.
She says that if Kishen
asks her to marry him..
..then she will be
his slave forever.
If l marry her, then l
will have to be her slave.
You already are.
I am here to change your future.
Only if Mala lets me have a future.
Come here.
Leave me alone, Bunty.
Kishen.
He dared to set eyes on my Mala.
Just watch now, l will
make his plight so bad..
..that he will never
think of Mala again.
And then.. Mala will become mine.
Enough, enough, enough!
Just a minute.
Now Kishen will publicly announce..
..that he wants to marry Mala.
Clap.
If l say anything to
her she will kill me.
Bunty, please let me go.
- No. - Let me go, Bunty.
Come on, Kishen.
Now call Mala near you, go.
Mala, come here.
She doesn't want to come,
let's go home, Bunty.
Are you calling the pigeons?
Order her! Call her with a
controlling voice, Kishen.
Come on, come on, come on.
Mala.
- What is it?
Come here.
Loudly, Kishen, come on.
Kishen! Come on, Kishen.
Come here.
You.. come here.
- Okay.
Let's go home, Bunty. Let's go home.
Look, Kishen, we
can't step back now.
The bet has been made.
That arrow has been shot, Kishen.
For God's sake, Kishen, go.
Close your zip.
You're just.. Couldn't
you tell me earlier?
Come on, Kishen.
Come on, Kishen. Come on.
Let me be born of love, Kishen.
Prove it to Mala.
Kishen! Kishen!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Interval
You're hopeless.
There's no cure for you,
Mr. Kishen Kumar.
Do l have that high fever,
brother Bunty?
I am talking about your personality.
You fainted holding a girl's hand.
I got such a major shock.
Was Mala an electrical pole?
You know what, l quit.
I am going.
- Where?
To hell. Do you have a problem?
Why are you yelling?
Because l am frustrated.
I came back only
to make you forward.
But it's just a waste of time.
Because you can't change.
You know, l am sorry to say this..
..but you'll stay a
dimwit all your life.
I won't stop you if
you want to leave, Bunty.
But I would like to say that..
..no one's born smart or a dimwit.
After my mother passed away..
..my father didn't marry again..
..so that I don't get a step-mother.
That's why I shouldered all the
responsibilities of the house.
Kishen was reduced to Kitchen Kumar.
After that.. I was my
father's son and his companion.
I would look after
father in the house..
..and the customers
at the restaurant.
That was my life.
Now you tell me, Bunty..
..how could I keep
up with the world..
..with all the responsibilities?
Now if you will also leave,
then this dimwit..
..will always remain a dimwit.
I might be a dimwit..
..but l will make my son very smart.
Just like you.
I won't give him any responsibility.
I will educate him.
I will teach him
everything that I don't know.
I will give him all the
happiness that l never got.
Just watch, Bunty, my son
will never take after me.
Can I say something?
I love you, dad.
Why do you call me dad?
You will find that
out 30 years later.
Now watch, dad, l will
teach Mala a lesson.
I love you, dad.
But don't give Mala much trouble,
brother Bunty.
Did you see Kishen's face?
I should look at him too.
He was shivering so severely..
..that l thought he might
fall apart piece by piece.
But he fell unconscious before that.
Friends,
congratulations for Kishen's..
Cheers!
Drink it, drink all
the coco cola you want.
It's going to be
banned after 2 years.
Come, Bunty, sit down.
What would you like to have?
Poor Kishen is suffering and you..
You said that
"Kishen has become brave".
I didn't ask you.
And as far as
celebrations are concerned..
..then can't l celebrate my victory?
I wouldn't have interfered if
you were celebrating your victory.
But you are
celebrating someone's defeat.
Of someone's helplessness.
While pretending to be heartless..
You really have become one, Mala.
Stop! Stop!
When someone has lost her father..
..and mother goes to work,
she has to stay stern..
..for the world.
Otherwise the world
won't let us live peacefully.
Mother has suffered a lot
after father passed away, Bunty.
The shopkeeper would intentionally..
..try to catch her
hand whenever she would..
..go to buy rations.
Whenever she would
visit the doctor..
..he would make her breathe deeply.
Mother was very beautiful,
but she was all alone.
Once a drunkard barged in
our house with a garland.
Mother was frightened
and started screaming.
That was it.
After that mother decided.
Mala, if you want to survive,
keep the world at your feet.
Only the strong can
live in this world.
But if you're weak you
will have to suffer.
Wait.
I didn't know, mom.
I didn't know.
Kishen, close your eyes.
- Will you sport a knife?
No, no.
Here you go.
Give me a smile.
Oh God! He needs a
complete makeover.
Come.
Can I open my eyes?
Sorry, dad.
My teeth!
They're not tusks for which
you're screaming so loudly.
Help.
One.
Oh!
What's this!
How is it, Bunty?
I did four.
1 7, 1 8, 19, 20..
32, 33, 34.. come on,
come on, Ghajini.
Who is Ghajini?
- No one, continue.
We're coming, Mala, we're coming.
What?
What's this?
This is just Rs. 200.
- So?
I can only lock Kundan
for seven days for this.
My job will be done in seven days.
Really?
Come on.
- What happened, sir?
Come on.
- There's some confusion, sir.
But what have I done?
Will I have to tell you that?
Can't you think..
..what you've done wrong
in the last seven days?
Think.
Think for seven days.
Seven days.
The red one. The red one.
Kishen, point no.1 .
Don't get too
excited and start singing.
Just move your lips and l will sing.
Point no. 2, don't
give Mala any importance.
Make her restless.

Well-done, Kishen.
Come on, Kishen. Let's go. Kishen.
Kishen, l've been..
- Lower your voice.
Tell me about my appointments.
Sir, first you've
to meet P.T. Usha.
Meet her today or else
she will run away, sir.
After that you've to
meet Saif Ali Khan.
Saif Ali Khan.
Did you tell him about my project?
- Yes.
What did he say?
He made a tattoo of
Kishen on his arm.
Foolish.
After that Sachin Tendulkar,
Virender Sehwag..
..and Barrack Obama
wants to meet you, sir.
Tell them not this week,
we'll meet next week. Sorry.
Look, Kishen..
- Lower your voice.
That's right, two days later
you'll be going on a world tour.
Adlabs, MlDCO, lnfinity, Noida.
Lokhandwala Complex.
Of course, Lokhandwala Complex.
Sir, if l may ask.
Is it compulsory for a
hotel owner like you..
..to go to the
market to buy vegetables?
Look, no matter how
rich a person becomes..
..but his feet should
always be on the ground.
What's the name of our servant?
- Bhikhu.
Bhikhu.
If he isn't ready to work for
1 1 hours, then throw him out.
Anyway he doesn't know how to cook.
There are other people here who
don't know how to cook at all.
Hey, look, Kishen..
- Lower your voice.
Yes, sir. Let's go.
Hey, Mona!
Let's go.
Congrats.
Driver, let's go to All lndia Radio.
I've left that black car for you.
And that driver as well.
Consider that car is yours now.
Brother Bahadur, l
always believed that.
No, no, no. You don't have
to consider it any longer.
That car really belongs to
you now. And the driver too.
Okay.
Driver.
- Yes, madam.
Take sir to the restaurant.
Now your duty is with him.
Would you close the door, please?
Let's go, driver.
He's coming.
"Come, my darling."
"The body's burning.."
What is it?
Will I have to ask what's wrong?
Hey!
Get him.
Help!
Let me go.
Brother Kishen.
Pick up the knife.
I will..
- Lower.. your voice.
I will do everything.
I will do all the work, master.
Leave.
Oh, God!
What is your name?
Kundan Lal.
And you?
- Raman Raghvan.
Raman Raghvan.
What do you do? - Murders.
What am l doing?
"Look at the condition
of your world, Lord.."
Bhikhu, you traitor..
You never washed a
spoon at our house..
..and you're washing
this big car here.
Don't you see I am working?
I don't speak when l am working.
My master has said that.
Which master?
Bhikhu!
Greetings, master!
How many times have l told you..
..not to talk to useless
people while washing the car?
Look, Kishen..
- Lower.. your voice.
I want ice. l want
to make something,.
Bunty, install a new
fridge in their house.
So that she doesn't
make excuses to come here.
I didn't make any excuse..
- Lower.. your voice.
I wanted to make ice-cream for you.
That's why..
You will make ice-cream?
I will learn it if you.. - lt's not
a difficult job to learn, Ms. Mala.
How will you make it?
I have milk, cream,
almonds, and the mould.
And the ice from you.
You've everything, but yet..
..you can't make the ice-cream.
Because there's one
thing that you don't have.
And that's love.
Go. And defame a
helpless man publicly.
Snatch his money and
get something to eat..
You hurt me..
Get lost, Bhikhu.
Go.
Come on, dad.
I am ruined.
What's going on, Mala?
Can't you see l am cooking, mother?
That's why.
I was wondering where this
foul stench is coming from.
Hello, Grandma.
When did you keep
the cooker to boil?
Since afternoon, why?
Why you..
This stench will
remain for an entire week.
You can scrape today's
dinner off the walls.
Let it be, Mala. Forget it.
Making a cup of tea is
not your cup of tea.
Go and learn something from Kishen.
Darn you and your arrogant Kishen.
Kishen, arrogant?
You're also fooled.
Kishen's clothes,
confidence and fate has changed..
..but his heart is just as it was.
Golden.
Innocent.
Full of love.
You can test it, Mala.
What is it?
- Bhikhu, you traitor.
Open the door.
The hotel is closed
today for customers.
Today is Kishen sir's birthday.
And he's busy in one
of his parties.
You can't go inside.
Bhikhu.
Yes, sir.
So, what did you see?
Arrogant Kishen or darling Kishen?
You will find out at night..
what I saw.
You're too cute, mom.
Bunty, what will I
find out at night?
Whatever you find out..
..but you won't give Mala
any importance, that's all.
I will. l will.
Because l feel so.
Not at all.
Bunty, just a little..
- Lower.. your voice.
Copying me!
Hello. Hi.
Hi!
Thank you. Thank you.
Don't do this.
Always up, alright.
Kishen.
Mala.
- Kishen.
My Malu left in a fit
of rage because of you.
Malu. Now she's Malu.
She brought that
cake with so much love.
Now she left in a fit of rage.
I have to go and clear the air now.
I will have to say sorry to her.
- No.
She will say sorry.
Don't you see she
still has her attitude?
You will have to
bring her under control.
Go, l will think
about our next step.
Did you think of anything?
Give me a minute, pops. Come on.
It's not an easy job
to raise your parents.
Mala, stop.
What happened, Mala?
Why are you crying?
Mala.
Am l that bad, Mona?
What happened?
Why is he treating me this way?
Why doesn't he
understand my feelings?
Oh God! That means Bunty..
No, Mona, Bunty is
like a brother to me.
I..
I like Kishen..
Bunty, you're very cruel.
What are you two doing
at 2 O'clock in the night?
Nothing, father, l was
only cutting my birthday cake.
Come and taste it, come on.
Look.
I'm not giving you too much
as you are a diabetes patient.
Have you mixed poison in it?
Tic 20.
I know, father, the recipe is wrong.
But there's one thing
that's in abundance.
Love.
Mother's love, isn't it?
Are you missing your mother?
I miss Bina on such quiet nights.
But what can l do?
Son, if you give your
consent for the marriage..
..then this house will be
filled with happiness again.
Father, l am ready.
Yes, yes.
I will talk to the
priest tomorrow and inquire.
I will surely find some widow
or divorcee.. suited for me.
Bina. Bina.
He's thinking about his marriage.
What an idiot!
No, Bunty, I am the idiot.
I've already troubled Mala a lot.
That's all.
- l know.
But we're doing it for her benefit.
But the poor girl has changed now.
My Mallika is now not the same.
Mallika.
I am going.
Even we don't propose to
girls at 2:30 in the night.
Wait till morning.
You can tell her your
feelings in the morning.
I will die by morning.
"My dreams made me cry."
"l am waiting for the dawn."
Come on, come on.
You've got bail. Come on.
Bail? Who was it?
He's waiting outside in the car.
It's some Mahesh Kumar.
He says that he
passes this way everyday..
..and hears you
singing in two voices.
Come on, have you finished. Come on.
Now watch what l do?
Kishen will be out.
And Mala will be mine.
Why you..
Raghavan.
Constable!
Pops!
Go, Pops, be victorious.
Tell mother about your feelings.
Mother?
But I love the daughter,
not the mother.
What will I do with her?
I mean the mother of
your future children.
Now go. Come on, dad.
He was partying
with the other girls.
I got a cake for him
so much affection..
But that Kishen..
Change your style, Kishen. Be cool.
Come on.
Mala.
You!
What is it?
- l.. l.. I.. l..
Will you stop
stammering and speak up?
I came here to tell you that
the cake you made yesterday..
You ate it?
- Yes.
How was it?
If anyone wants to
learn how to bake a cake..
..then you..
- Yes, I..
Then they should never
take lessons from you.
Because it wasn't a cake,
but it was cow-dung.
What?
Mala.
Kundan.
Where were you so many days?
You look very happy.
There's good news.
I have found a job.
Ask where?
- The mental asylum.
Where?
With Mahesh Kumar
and Party. As a singer.
Mahesh Kumar and Party!
And my salary is Rs. 400 a month.
Which party is this?
I have never heard
about this party before.
Mala, just watch.
Kundan will soon become a star..
..by singing in two voices.
Kundan, l am very happy.
Just watch, you'll be a
famous singer. - Thank you.
And anyway l like singers.
Especially those who
can sing in two voices.
Two voices..
If you can sing in two voices.
Then l..
Can sing in four voices.
I see.
Want to bet?
Shall we have a competition?
Dad, no. Dad.
Let's do it..
And Mala will garland the winner..
- What?
Mala, don't interfere.
No, no, Dad.
I accept the bet.
- Dad.
Have you lost your mind?
You went there to
express your feelings to Mala..
..and instead you
made a bet with Kundan.
Forget about four voices..
..you can't even sing in
your own voice. - I know.
I know!
I was angry with myself..
..because l couldn't
express my feelings to Mala.
And when l tried to..
..that dual voice Kundan
Lal interfered in between.
What should I do?
In a fit of rage l blurted nonsense.
I said it.
What now, Bunty?
- What now?
You will lose the bet
and Mala will marry Kundan.
And only half of me will be born.
Lord, tonight's the
biggest night of my life.
Make the one l love win tonight.
And l want.. only Kishen to win.
Kundan. Kundan.
"Love is my game."
"That's what my heart yearns for."

possession in your heart."
"Kundan, watch me now."
4 Voices!
Kishen, you rock.
Everybody.. Everybody..
Something's wrong.
I know they've cheated.
Otherwise that unmelodious Kishen..
And you, Mala..
You were very happy
about his victory.
He's not suited for you.
You're absolutely right, Kundan.
Kishen is no longer
suited for Mala.
Girls don't leave him alone.
Rani, Priety,
Kareena, Katrina, Deepika..
Who can l stop?
Tell me, Kundan.
Katrina writes, "My Salman,
I am forever yours."
Bipasha writes, "My John..".
- John?
"Love. l am forever yours".
- Great.
Who are all they?
- And Kareena.
I can't read Kareena's letters.
She has written everything Saif.
What should I do?
No, don't do anything.
Just relax.
Because now Mallika Sherawat..
..is doing what needs to be
done at 'Rock n Roll' club.
Mona, don't mind.
But you look like a shuttlecock.
- Shut up!
Come here.
Thank you for seducing me.
She's here.
Is she looking this way?
What happened, Mala?
Where are you going?
To die.
Dad.
- Why didn't you stop her?
You should've said we
were just testing her.
Now Malu has passed the final test.
Now she definitely loves you
and she's in your control.
Go and tell her your feelings, go.
Leave me first.
This time l don't think
we'll need seven years to meet.
We'll meet in a year, Kishen.
They found their love,
now it's our turn.
Look, Mona, l'm
thankful for helping me out..
..but l can never fill
the distance between us.
Wishes don't count, Bunty.
Either you fall in
love or you don't.
So just say yes or no.
Do you love me?
No.
I love someone else.
And she's waiting for me.
Mala.
Mala.
- What is it?
Are you going to die?
- Yes.
Where?
- At Chowpatty.
But how is it possible?
I can drown myself in the sea.
But how does that concern you?
You can go back to
your Mallika.. Sherbet.
But, Mala.. l won't leave you alone.
What do you mean?
Mala, the water at
Chowpatty is cold at night.
I suggest you go
tomorrow afternoon at 2:30.
The water will be warm then.
You will die easily and
won't have to suffer much.
Stop, my Vaijanti.. Mala.
Before you go l want
to say just one thing.
Listen carefully.
Mala, l love you a lot.
It was just a
drama planned by Bunty.
That girl with the wig was Mona.
There's no Sherbet in my life.
If there's anyone in my
life then.. that's you.
My short-tempered.. big eyed.
"We've finally fallen in love."
"l pray no one jinxes it."
"We've finally fallen in love."
"l pray no one finds out about it."
"We've finally fallen in love."
"l pray no one jinxes it."
"We've finally fallen in love."
"l pray no one finds out about it."
"l dwell in your thoughts."
"Your love has lit up my life."
"l laugh without a reason."
"l sway without the intoxication."
"l flow like the current."
"Now I am always happy."
"l dwell in your thoughts."
"Your love has lit up my life."
"We've finally fallen in love."
"l pray no one jinxes it."
"We've finally fallen in love."
"l pray no one finds out about it."
"You're.. a dream."
If Mala can't be mine..
..then she can't be
yours either, Kishen.
Watch what l do?
Ms. Bholi Devi, l am coming.
"l laugh.. when you do."
"Whenever you're sad.."
"..l want to fill
you with happiness."
"l don't know why l am mesmerized."
"Why does everything
seem so calm and soothing?"
"Every season looks new,
so do my emotions."
"l rise like dawn
and set like dusk."
"l smolder like fire."
"l walk in my sleep."
"l dwell in your thoughts."
"Your love has lit up my life."
"We've finally fallen in love."
"l pray no one jinxes it."
"We've finally fallen in love."
"l pray no one finds out about it."
"You're.. a dream."
Mala! Kishen!
Kishen! Mala!
- Bunty.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- But where?
Your marriage.
- Our marriage? So soon.
Bunty, we just sang a duet song.
- Yes.
Mala, you never told me..
..that your mother is
against love marriage.
Mother has found out about us?
Is my father still alive
or has her mother shot him?
Kundan has told them
everything about you two.
Now your mother and your
father are after your lives.
Run, come on.
- But where are we going?
The temple, the
auspicious hour is passing by.
And if you don't get married now..
..l might never be born.
Come on, run.
Drive faster. Drive faster.
They are following us.
Drive faster.
Stop.
Mala, stop the car or else
I will kill Rai Bahadur.
Aunt and Gabbar
instead of Jai and Veeru.
And behind them Thakur and Ramlal.
Our parents are chasing
us and you're enjoying it?
Eloping from the house and
getting married has its own fun.
Bunty. - Bunty.
Stop the car. - Stop the car.
Bunty.
- Mother. - Stop the car.
This marriage isn't possible.
Grandma, you wanted to
get Mala married to Kishen.
So what's wrong now?
Now they love each other.
That's the problem.
I am strictly against love marriage.
I never let anyone
perform love marriage..
..in my neighborhood.
This is crazy. - Stop there, idiot.
Father. - Couldn't you find
anyone else to fall in love?
This is their trick.
So that she doesn't have
to pay rent all her life.
I don't care about your rent.
I would rather die than
let this marriage take place.
You're going to die in 1 978.
Thank God.
The entire city will be rid of her.
No need to be so happy, grandpa.
Because in 1 979.. you too..
Watch out.
Oh no!
Kishen.
Bunty, stop the car.
Kishen, if l stop the car..
..then we'll be lying on the bier.
No, Bunty. We can't lay the
foundation of our dreams..
..on someone's corpse.
- Yes.
Then l am ready to take
full responsibility, Kishen.
Just slide it down respectfully.
They will pick it up, okay.
Okay. Sorry. Sorry.
Kishen. - Bravo, throw
down the corpse and the girl.
"May his soul..
- Rest in peace."
Kishen is looking so nice.
I wish Rai Bahadur
was lying on that bier.
Look, uncle, your son is
shouldering someone else's bier.
Shut up and drive.
Oh no! - Bunty, careful.
Naany(Grandma)..
No. No. No.
Let's go. Mala.
Aunt, that's my hand.
- Shut up!
Love marriage isn't possible,
that's it.
Mother. Kishen.
- Mala.
Kishen.
- Mala. Mala. Mala.
Come on, Kishen, do something now.
Come on.
Kishen, this is your last chance.
- l.. l..
Be a man and fight, Kishen.
He can't be a man.
He's a fool. Just a fool.
And the proof is that..
..he loves a girl who is
a stigma for womankind.
Come on, dad.
It's a goon hiding under
the clothes of a woman.
Kundan, what are you..
- Quiet.
No one will say anything today.
This girl is just as soft
from inside as strong she looks.
She loved me earlier.
But now she loves Kishen
just because he's rich now.
Who will marry a
characterless woman like her?
I would've slapped you
even if Mala didn't love me.
What kind of a man are you?
You claim to love a girl..
..and now you talk
nonsense about her..
..when she says 'no' to you.
I feel like taking your shirt
off and making you dance here.
Mala. Come here.
Apologize to Mala.
Say sorry or else l
will thrash you so badly..
..that the doctor will say 'Sorry,
your son is dead'.
Say sorry.
Sorry, Mala.
Not Mala, say 'Sorry, sister'.
'Sorry, sister'.
Say it!
Sorry, sister.
- lts okay, brother.
Thank you.
And you two, senior citizens.
Your punishment is that..
..you two have to live
together like kin, get that.
Never!
- Lower your voice.
Kishen, she's my mummy.
- Fine.
So, aunt..
Mala and l didn't get married,
have only fallen in love.
You get us married.
So your problem of love
marriage will be solved as well.
I.. was saying the same.
- Good.
I am not ready for the marriage.
You shouldn't get
married at this age, either.
Get that!
We are getting married.
You can say anything
you want right now.
You idiot..
- Lower your voice.
We're going for our
honeymoon after the marriage.
Where?
- Lokhandwala Complex.
Bunty, you're just amazing.
I am getting married because of you.
And you won't attend my marriage?
That's not right.
It's not right for me to
stay for your marriage, Kishen.
I should leave before
your nuptial night..
..or else there'll be a
chance of double role.
You will come back, won't you?
I will, of course l will.
And this time l will come sooner.
By losing some weight,
weighing only seven pounds.
You will understand when you see it.
No one ever understands what you..
What are you doing?
I am going to miss you..
- l am going to miss you.
Here, Bunty. I made it myself.
Really, Mala.
You made it yourself?
For your journey.
Don't eat outside.
No.
I love you.
Bless you.
I will miss you, son.
Me too, grandpa. Me too.
God bless you.
Who will praise me now?
My most beautiful grandma.
If you can't make it,
then call us there.
I wish l could do that, grandma.
I wish l could do that.
Bless you.
Goodbye.
Go.
'Time machine brought me to the same
party from where l went to 1 975.'
'l hope everything's changed now.'
Bhikhu. How do you
work so much for Kishen?
Won't he throw me out of
the house if I don't work?
It's a great party.
Let's have a duet song.
You know I never sang
after losing to you.
You're getting serious.
Wow, dad! Well done!
Listen.
Go. Your wife is calling you.
He's my husband, Kundan Lal.
He's the manager of Shreya
Bank's Nalasopara branch.
And they are Mr. and Mrs.
Khurana. - Nice meeting you.
Mom.
If l had known you
will take so long..
..then I would've
given you a miniskirt.
If l had known that
you're so restless..
..l wouldn't have come down.
I would've called you upstairs.
- Then you should have.
By the way, guys, take it easy.
Relax!
Where were you?
I was around. - 'Around.'
I suggest that you
handle the party here.
And l will take your
mother to the private party..
..yacht party. Understand.
Hey, listen, listen..
- Lower.. your voice.
Okay, then..
- Let's go, wife. - Let's go.
Come on.
Professor.
Professor, can l borrow
her for a second? - Sure!
You will handle the party?
- Of course!
Thank you, professor.
- Have fun! - Come on.
Bye.
- Bye.
Bunty, stop!
What?
- Tanya. Will you marry me?
Are you serious?
- Very serious.
Of course!
I love you, Bunty.
"What a terrible blunder!"

"lt's a bundle of grief.
It's after your life."
"lt's better to die than marrying."
"lt's the reason for all sorrows."
"What a terrible blunder."
"Marriage turned into a nightmare."
Lower your voice!
"When you're attending a marriage.
Always advice him."
"Don't get married. lt's dreadful."
"Don't regret it later."
"Here's your chance. Run away now."
"Pacify your heart
that's eager for marriage."
"Run away from the marriage dais."
"What a terrible blunder."
Lower your voice..
"The person that.. got
married first in the world."
"Catch him, thrash him."
"He's responsible for the mistake."
"He was stupid."
"He was cruel and ruined others."
"Kill him cruelly."
"What a terrible blunder."
"Marriage turned into a nightmare."
"What a terrible blunder."
