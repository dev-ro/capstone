(plane buzzing)
[Man] Thanks, man,
I'm getting off here.
(air whooshing)
(car engine roaring)
(birds chirping)
A hippo, over there, look.
(gun fires)
(men screaming)
You dirty.
(hippo laughing)
Ah, go to hell.
(man groaning)
No, it can't be him.
Shut up!
You're not gonna leave us here
with these wild beasts, are you?
Yes.
But we paid in advance.
Never pay in advance.

(people chattering)
Slow down, Tom.
Man, do you know who's back?
This.
No, it's a good one.
Here's another
one, it's a pot.
[Man] Look, he's coming.
He took a bath.
It was about time, eh?
Yeah, use a tub instead
of a toilet next time.
[Man] Yeah, smells like
a radish, doesn't he?
[Merchant] Tom, do
you know who is back?
Yes.
And he's more
handsome than ever.
He's more handsome
than ever, ah!
A drink, John?
No, thanks.
All right, whoever hits
the bull's eye wins, aye?
Yeah, sure, why not?
Aye, we're betting up here.
No, stop, it's a sacred image.
Well, can anyone do better?
(chuckling) It's a good shot.
'Course, I can do better.
Okay, let's see, let's see.
He said the picture is sacred.
Watch out, they're
Ormond's men.
You wanna swallow
that pink pacifier?
You know why this
pacifier is pink?
No.
Because my mummy wanted
a little baby girl.
(man screaming)
(thumping and smacking)
(men grunting and groaning)
Oh, not the arm, not the arm.
Mr. Ormond won't
be very happy.
Oh, Tom, it's you, listen...
Yeah, lock up, ma.
And don't let anyone in.
[Ma] What's wrong?
Slim is back.
Hi, Tom.
This time I'll kill you.
Hey.
Calm down, Tom.
I mean, our fathers
were brothers.
They were brothers not us.
Why did you come back?
Oh, Tom, it's Ma's birthday.
Look, I brought you a present.
Happy birthday.
Oh, how beautiful.
Yeah, I have a
present, too, Ma.
Here, and it's nicer than his,
but it ended up on the water.
Where did you get it?
In Manila, you
know where that is.
You just go back, that's
where bums like you belong.
Around here, everyone works now.
Work, you call that work.
Didn't you promise your father
you'd never hunt
an animal again?
That's my business.
It's my business.
I have to answer to him not you,
you made me lose
50 pound sterling.
You said 50 pounds.
Yeah.
Here you go.
Yeah.
Hey, Ma, you see Slim is back?
Come on, Slim, why
don't you sit down?
You hungry, man?
I knew you'd
make your fortune.
Tom, you want a fried egg?
Two, please.
It's sure nice to
see you again, Tom.
Yeah, and you're more
handsome than ever.
You know, you came
back at the right time,
business is great.
[Slim] Hm, great, huh?
Yeah, and if you agree,
we could go into partnership
and open up an agency,
a tourist agency.
A tourist agency?
Yeah.
You mean, tourists
actually come here?
[Tom] Sure, all the time.
Almost never.
It's a deal.
Good.
Was thinking of buying a new
bus, red and blue, only 408.
[Slim] Is it an English bus?
[Tom] No, no.
[Slim] American?
[Tom] A little bit of both.
[Samson] Ma.
Samson, what's the matter?
I got stomachache.
[Ma] Oh, it's nothing.
[Slim] You don't even
know what to make of it.
[Tom] Sure.
(monkey shrieking)
Eliza, girl.
Oh, look at her, shame on you,
showing your lump that way.
Oh, what an actress.
[Samson] Ma, I
got stomachache.
I'm busy now,
go see the doctor.
But you said he's a fake.
[Ma] If I say he can fix
your stomach, he can fix it.
If you say so.
[Tom] A whatchumacallit.
Is it serious, doc?
Could be, could be.
(harmonica melody)
Oh, go on, it's nothing.
[Samson] But I'm sick,
I've got stomachache.
Go see Ma.
You said she's a fake.
Ah, don't worry, even a...
Slim!
I'm happy to see you again.
Me too.
[Doctor] Where have you been?
Oh, here and there.
[Doctor] Doing what?
Nothing.
(chuckling) Yeah, I
was sure of that, yeah.
What about you?
The usual, Ma keeps
stealing my patients away
with her witchcraft, but
she can't any longer.
Not since penicillin
was discovered.
I saw your newspaper
hanging outside.
Pretty good, huh?
How many copies do you print?
Two, and since
almost every day,
Ormond's men rip one off
the wall, I replace it.
Who reads it?
No one does, but
it doesn't matter,
one day they'll learn to read.
Who's this Ormond?
A tyrant, a real gangster.
If he keeps on doing
what he's been doing,
there won't be an animal left,
he kills them and
he exports them,
all the elephants are gone.
Not the butterflies.
Beautiful.
I never saw this one before.
(triumphant melody)
(gorilla grunting)
- Mr. Ormond, excuse me, Mr.
- Ormond, do you remember me?
I worked for you a
long time, that's me,
see we have a picture together
when you won the championship.
You sure have changed.
I gotta return to
Hoboken, I'm sick.
You'll never make it.
Who let him in here?
[Man] He said he
was a friend of yours.
[Ormond] I don't
have any friends.
[Man] Sorry, I forgot.
Throw him out.
[Peter] Mr. Ormond, sir.
Well, well, our famous lawyer.
Peter, I'll talk to you later.
[Peter] Oh, as
you wish, sir, but...
[Ormond] Beat it, Peter.
[Peter] Yes, sir.
Shall I read that
newspaper, Mr. Ormond?
Yeah.
Read it, good and loud.
Right.
God created this a rich country,
a land with infinite resources,
bountiful enough for
all men to enjoy,
but one day, a thief called
Ormond came to our country,
shall I go on?
Yeah.
A gangster, a
tyrant without respect
for law or human rights.
Ready?
Ready, boss.
A man who gains power
through corruption,
a man who is the
personification of evil,
there have been others like him,
but he has found a
new way to rob us,
by slaughtering
all the wildlife,
by killing off our elephants,
hoarding all the ivory.
Mr. Ormond is not only a
thief, but a profiteer,
a corrupt man.
Yeah.
(men grunting and groaning)
Can't you read that later?
You boys don't
train hard enough.
Get me another one.
[Man] The despicable
Mr. Ormond...
That's enough.
[Man] It was the best part.
I'll shut that guys
mouth once and for all.
The map.
Yes, sir.
Come.
[Man] Here we are, sir.
[Man] Give it here,
I'll take care of it.
I need this area here, near
the river, to build a dock.
There's some shacks down there,
I want it all cleared out.
Aren't there
natives living there?
Africa's full of
natives, take 'em out.
What if they won't go?
It's your business to
make sure they do go.
I know how to treat natives.
Whatever happens, make
it look like an accident.
[Man] I'll give you five
pounds for your shack,
more than they're worth.
(upbeat music)
[Man] Out, I say.
You have one hour to
get all your things out.
Sir, please, where
will me and my family go?
That's up to you.
Africa's a big country, lot
of space to choose from.
Hey, look where that
one put his house.
He sure picked
himself a nice spot.
[Man] Isn't that
where the dock will go?
Hey, you in there.
Hey, you're getting five
pounds for this shack,
hurry up and knock it down.
Go on.
(man screaming)
(whistle blowing)
Hey, there's trouble
down there, let's go.
Step back.
One, two, three.
What'd you do, lose count?
I've no intention of selling.
Let go, listen to me.
In case you don't know,
Mr. Ormond can have this place
expropriated for a public good.
Understand?
You sure it's for
the public's good?
I've got a hunch it's
for Ormond's good.
We've got the law on our side.
(wood clattering)
(water splashing)
Now, the law's in the river.
Leave it to me.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Whatever you say may
be held against you.
No, leave it to us.
Oh, look what you did.
I still have no
intention of selling.
I offer you 10 pounds.
30.
40.
I can't go over that.
Sure you can.
(marching band music)
(speaking in foreign language)
[Man] What he say?
[Man] Oh, I know,
he's talking Japanese.
[Man] It must be that,
let's go to the side,
something is wrong.
[Man] Where would they
be, Japan and London.
[Man] Are those
animals moving?
They go fast
now, 70 miles hour.
But they were standing still.
Only looks that way.
[Man] Stop the car, we can't
aim with you bouncing around.
I can't the
savanna's dangerous.
We like danger.
Yeah, well, not me.
(men chatting)
[Man] Sounded like it.
[Man] Why you stop?
Hey, guide.
Hey, guide.
Let's follow the guide.
[Man] Maybe he saw some game.
[Man] You follow the
guide, I'm staying here.
Why?
Oh, I get you.
You wanna get in the
insurance company.
Only I'm not insured.
You're not insured?
Bad.
Tom, you're not the
kinda partner I like
and I don't like safaris either.
Now that you're rich,
you think you can do
whatever you like.
Me, rich, I
haven't got a cent.
Haven't got a cent.
But when we spoke, you...
I never said anything.
You never said anything, huh?
Well, I bought a
bus on your word.
On my word?
Yeah, on your word.
408 pounds, you were
supposed to be my guarantee.
Now, who's gonna pay?
Them hunters weren't gonna
get any animals, Slim.
No way, all the shells
were blanks, look.
(tire hissing)
Blanks, huh?
Sayonara.
Oh, I forgot that
mine was loaded.
You cheated us.
We heard what you said,
guns loaded with blanks.
Go.
(knuckles cracking)
(fighting exclamations)
Slim made a fortune, huh?
Made a fortune, did he?
Well, put it all back.
Why?
'Cause we can't afford it, Ma.
But Slim is coming
to dinner, Tom.
Not anymore.
You stay here,
the rest with me.
Where is the owner
of this shack?
Why?
Because we have
to knock it down
or do you want to
argue about it?
I think we should
discuss the matter.
You asked for it, okay, boys.
No, wait, make
him an offer first.
Yeah, he hits hard.
We're offering 50 pounds.
Take or leave?
I'll sell it for 408.
What, 408 pounds?
I'd shoot him.
Shut up, Slimy.
Hold it a minute, are we
gonna let him push us around?
We can go back to
Ormond empty-handed.
[Man] It's suicide.
[Slimy] That's why
I say to shoot him.
We'll make mince
meat out of him.
Later, now we pay.
Let's at least beat him up.
Later.
[Man] Pounds each?
Well.
Here you are, but you'll
have to sign for it.
Where?
Sign here.
Can we demolish it right now?
Sure.
(excavator rumbling)
Hey.
Leave my name there,
seeing as how you bought the bus
with the money you
got from my shack.
Okay.
But I give the orders.
That's fine with me, just
don't fly off the handle,
and give me five
pounds, will ya?
Thanks, partner.
Hey, there's no more
left, where you going?
Ah, don't worry.
One more thing.
The men lose and the lady wins,
if the hand is quicker
than the eye, I win.
Men place your bets.
On that one?
Yeah.
All right, we turn over.
You lose.
And you win, sir, five pounds.
One, two, three, four, five.
All right.
The two men lose, man
lose, and the lady wins,
and the lady wins, man lose,
if the hand is quicker than
the eye, I win, if not,
place your bets.
Quiet, please.
This card?
Lady, the gentlemen wins.
One more time.
The man lose, the lady wins.
If the hand is quicker
than the eye, I win.
Place your bets.
The same one?
You win.
(Tom cheers)
Shut up.
Thank you.
Hey, you've got to give us a
chance to win our money back.
He gives the orders.
We're partners?
We're partners.
All right, go.
Hey.
If the hand is bigger than
the eye, place your bets.
Hey, Slim, slow down.
How much did we win?
I have to count it.
30 pounds.
Why, hey, where you going?
To make an investment.
[Tom] Oh, to
make an investment.
The door.
[Jason] The door.
Thank you.
Hi, Jason.
Hi, it's you, Slim.
Hi.
Hello, Tom.
Listen, Jason,
Tom here and myself
would like to take an
ad out in your paper,
a really nice one for
about 30 pounds, huh?
But my paper doesn't take ads.
Well, couldn't you do
it as a special favor?
Sorry, boys, but
it's against my policy.
Give me my share.
(bells chiming)
[Jason] The door.
Close it.
Close it.
Can you keep an eye on it?
Watch, it doesn't burn.
Did you print this?
Yes.
Mr. Ormond isn't very happy
with the tone of your newspaper.
If you keep on
printing that stuff,
he's gonna get very mad.
Oh, they're being
tough this time.
[Man] Nicest guy
unless you get him mad.
There's a new guy and
he doesn't fool around.
Clear, so remember no
more sideswipes at Ormond.
Is that what you
came to tell me?
Yes.
I've been told that already.
I'm sorry for you that
you don't understand.
'Cause I came to give
you some friendly advice.
The food is getting
cold, Jason, let's eat.
Oh, look, guys,
they're having a party.
We came at the right time.
Let's see what a good
host you are, old man.
The frying pan.
Hi.
No, no, wait.
Needs a little salt.
Little taste, chew,
chew, chew, chew, good?
Hey, you threw
away all that food.
It tasted awful.
You want us to get tough?
If you like.
Hey, that's a lot of
muscle, you an athlete?
Let's try it again, huh?
Hurry up, Slim, I'm starved.
(man groaning)
(funky music)
I think you got the message.
Loud and clear.
Let's go.
- [Man] Yeah, yeah.
- [Man] Yeah, yeah,
[Man] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
When Mr. Ormond
reads what you wrote,
there is going to be trouble.
[Man] Yeah, there's
gonna be trouble.
[Man] Lots of trouble.
Whoever's hungry, follow me.
Door.
[Child] Shut the door.
Anything I can do, Jason?
I don't know, what can you do?
Me, nothing.
Then don't worry about it.
Oh, enough, enough.
Hey, doc, mom made me okay.
[Jason] I told you.
She said three magic words.
Now, sitting and
moving bowels is easy.
You see?
Why are you taking this road?
It's a shortcut.
And I make the decisions.
(upbeat melody)
Sorry, I need
about half an hour.
You can visit the village.
It's still very primitive,
but don't worry,
the natives couldn't
be more peaceful.
They may be a
little shy, though,
the white man's been here only
six or seven times before.
[Slim] Hey, partner,
here's another white man.
Maybe eight or nine.
No, buddy, I
could not sell it.
It belonged to my
father, my father father,
father of my father father.
I'll give you five pounds.
I'll give you ten pounds.
No, no sale for that one.
Always here, my father,
my father father,
father of my father father.
What tradition.
No sale for less
than 20 pounds.
It's a deal, I'll take it.
These Americans.
20?
Oh, all right.
Here you are.
[Man] Here you
are, thank you, Tom.
I'd get more if I were you.
How much more?
Double at least.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, get that
bus out of the way.
Could you please move it?
The keys are in the bus.
[Man] How much
did you say, Tom?
[Tom] Double at least.
[Man] Let's meet
tonight and discuss it.
Hey, Tom, they're
moving the bus.
You mean, they're stealing it.
Lifting it right
from under your nose.
What are you doing?
Hey!
This time we'll
break their legs.
Yeah.
Let's go.
You're the guy who told
me to move the truck.
Hey, keep your hands down.
Hey, Tom, Tom?
I think I'm in trouble, Tommy.
I saw them do it in Bangkok,
you know where
that is, don't you?
Sure I do.
Lots of muscles.
Oh, chucks.
Oh.
Oh.
Try again?
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
What's your name?
Careful.
Do something, it hurt.
Oh, it's against the rules.
What did you
say your name was?
Stella.
Oh, beautiful.
All aboard.
The show's over.
I said it's over.
I've had this notion
for a while now, Tom.
In fact, I've been meaning to
talk to you for a long time.
We've indulged in a few discreet
business deals together.
And so, I thought we
might form a partnership.
Tourism is becoming important.
I could give you 20%.
No, double at least.
[Businessman] We
can talk about it.
Hi, papa, hi, Tom.
Come down and join us.
[Stella] Okay, in a minute,
but you're always
talking business.
I'm doing this also for
Stella, she's my only child,
and this fake antique business,
you never know what can happen.
If I should be detained
for any reason,
an honest partner like you
can take care of her for me.
Forgive me, Tom, but
there is one other thing.
The tourist business requires
some public relations
and you should learn
to dress the part.
Tell me about Bangkok.
Bangkok?
Uh-Huh.
Oh, it's a great city.
It's the capital of Siam.
One of the richest
countries in the Orient,
the climate is extremely humid,
and the population is made up
principally of Indo-Chinese.
Did you know that Stella
was educated in Europe?
Oh, yeah, can she speak it?
[Stella] Tell me more
about your travels.
[ ]Businessman] I imagine it
must be very uncomfortable
in that position.
No, I often sit this way.
Goodnight, Stella.
Nice evening.
Bye.
[Businessman] Goodnight, son.
(speaking in foreign language)
What do you see?
I see a great future for you.
So, help me, I'll
wring your neck.
[Ma] Tom, don't
talk like that.
You better leave
that girl alone.
I didn't know, you like her?
I'll get it.
I couldn't care
less about Stella.
Then, why should
I leave her alone?
That's my business.
I thought your business
was our business.
Mr. Ormond would be honored
if you had lunch
with him tomorrow.
Yeah, we'll be there.
Hey, just a moment.
I'll decide, okay?
We'll be there.
Yeah.
Goodnight.
(whimsical melody)
Sit down.
They're gold.
Let's get to the point.
All right.
This is the point.
These must be yours, Mr. Ormond.
I imagine they were put
under our plates by mistake.
How big a mistake?
A small handout.
A very big mistake.
[Tom] That be jam?
No, it's caviar.
[Tom] Oh, yeah.
A little butter.
A punch of salt.
Some pepper.
And, and.
[Tom] And what?
And champagne.
C'est tres delicious.
I had the same in Paris.
You know where that is?
Sure.
Tres delicious.
Looks like midget sheep shit.
Go ahead.
How's yours?
Pretty good?
Very good.
It's a little tacky,
but it's edible.
We'll have desert
in the garden alone.
I think we'll get along,
in fact, I know we will.
It's all a question
of flexibility
because if you can't bend,
you break.
Tender.
(men chuckling)
Well, how much?
Double at least.
Okay.
We'll think about it.
Maybe you don't know
who's the boss around here?
I am.
That's a point I'd like
to clear up right now.
Listen, if you're gonna believe
all the garbage your black
doctor friend writes about me,
you'll end up suffering
the consequences.
Clear?
I'll get rid of him
and you's, too.
Well, you accept?
No.
[Tom] No.
You don't think
you're gonna leave
the same way as you
came in, do you?
Nope.
Nope.
Was a great lunch.
Yeah, great, yeah.
Come on.
Hold it.
Have a nice day, Leo.
The pool, the pool, the pool.
Can lions swim?
Yeah, but they
don't like water.
You sure?
Yeah.
You, too, pussycat.
Don't be shy, we all love you.
Hey, what are
you smiling about?
Please.
Nice lion, nice lion.
You smell those guys, huh?
Go on.
Come on in here,
get your guns.
Hurry it up, but this time,
we'll kill him, come on.
What are you standing there for?
What's the matter with you?
What?
No, not with the gorilla,
please, he hates me.
[Tom] I don't blame him.
[Slimy] Be a good boy,
nice gorilla, nice gorilla.
I love you like a brother,
don't you remember me?
You know, I liked the
way you handled Ormond.
Your plan was perfect.
Yeah, of course.
If Ormond offered us
over a thousand dollars,
it means something
big is going on,
that's probably worth
a lot higher price,
don't you think so?
Oh, of course.
("Grau Grau Grau"
by Bud Spencer)
I'm getting off here.
Whoever's hungry, follow me.
(kids yelling)
Let's go, let's go.
Yeah, you can sit up here.
Come on, sit here.
* Watch out, Mr.
Lion, don't bite me
* Shout out if you wanna go free
* I'll hear when you
call and I answer you all
* Grau grau grau.
Okay, everybody.
* Some people
aren't nice to lions
* Some people aren't
nice to hippos
* We better think twice
let's try it be nice

* Lions are wild
* That's what most people say
* But I have seen
that malice king

you wanna go free.
[Man] Hey!

* So please, Mr.
Man, don't shoot me
* Don't catch me,
don't take me away
* It's here where I live,
let's forget and forgive
* Grau grau grau.
What about Ormond?
He was the only
unhappy animal.
Ever see this before, Jason?
You set down three stones,
then you take one, you take two,
and the third one, you
chuck in the brook,
and all you got
left is one, two,
[Jason] And three.
[Slim] It's not a bad trick.
Damn.
What is it?
A yellow morpho, the
most beautiful butterfly,
and it got away.
You told me you've
been trying to catch
a yellow morpho ever
since you were a child.
And I haven't caught one yet.
To put a stop to Ormond,
we really needed
someone like you.
Even as a kid, you didn't
like to be pushed around,
you wanted your
freedom, remember?
And you haven't changed.
What's got into you?
She's beautiful, isn't she?
You got her.
Why?
She was too beautiful.
You never change, Slim.
Hey, Tom, never
expected to find you here.
Yeah, well, I just...
Went out for a ride,
couldn't sleep.
You couldn't sleep.
So, this is where Ormond
stocks his animals, huh?
Yeah, boxed in like sheep,
ready to ship out.
Dirty dog, he's got
'em tagged and all.
Let's see.
Where is he shipping them?
Ontario, Canada, you
know where that is.
'Course I know.
God awful hot there, isn't it?
Oh, is it ever?
Anyway, why worry about it?
Go on.
Go on.
Don't they look nice?
[Slim] Yeah, they
remind me of you somehow.
[Tom] Very funny.
Hey, big mama, you
gonna free the lions, too?
No, you're gonna free them.
All right,
pussycats, let's go.
Here kitty, kitty,
kitty, here kitty,
up to, that's it
up to, off you go,
up to, single file, don't push,
you, too, come on,
anybody else hiding, okay.
Take off, sweeties.
What's a matter with him, Tom?
This is the third
time they catch him.
He's beginning to like it here.
Move it, come on.
Hey, he's coming right at us.
Keep cool, he'll move over.
If he doesn't stop,
he'll move us over.
[Slim] Look out.
Look there, will ya?
[Slim] There's a curve.
Keep your cool, Tom.
Oh, sure.
Hit the brake.
I'll hit your head.
[Slim] But we're clear.
I can't, not the push.
Hey, look out for the truck.
Where?
[Slim] There.
What do you
think you're doing?
Hey, hey.
We're slipping.
What happened to the brakes?
[Slim] Don't ask
me, you're the driver.
Come on, where's the road?
[Slim] I thought you knew.
[Tom] You're a big help.
Hey, what's that up there?
[Slim] Where?
There.
There's a fork ahead, see.
Oh, yeah, I know
where we are now.
Make a right turn,
I know the road,
it goes right through a field.
Where's the field?
Where are you, you
chicken-livered hyena?
You know the road, huh?
Went through a field, did it?
Some field.
If he ain't dead already,
so help me, I'll kill him.
Hey, where the...
Oh no, oh my god.
Hey.
Slim.
Stay still, don't you
believe in old Ma any longer?
All I need is a
little lodine, Ma.
That's the stuff doctors
use so you won't get well.
(chanting)
You destroyed my bus.
We're ruined.
Only 'cause you
weren't insured, Tom.
That's enough, boys.
It's time you start
acting like men.
The time has come to collect
and to do what your
fathers would have done.
Hey.
They would've shot each other.
That's a great idea.
I've got a better idea.
So, what's your better idea?
Oh, a robbery.
Yeah.
Anybody home?
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Good morning, gentleman.
Can I help you?
How much can I get for these?
Sorry, you can't enter
without a tie, it's a rule.
A rule is a rule.
Okay, thanks.
[Attendant] But sir, I...
Shut up.
So, what's your idea?
To win.
Madame.
Why did you do that for?
Be a gentleman.
I know what that is, yeah.
Thank you, madame
and monsieur.
Merci.
The house wins.
Another round (speaks French).
Here we go.
Place your bets.
[Man] I say there, you...
All right, we ready, mark
your bets clearly, please.
The bet is at 2,000 pounds
now, mark your bets up to...
I call the bet.
Yes, madame.
Mark your bets there, please.
Monsieur?
I'll be back.
Oui, monsieur.
We are ready?
You, monsieur, mark your bet.
I'm sorry, sir,
20 pounds minimum.
Here.
Finish, no more
betting, right, sir,
ready, shoot the cards, sir.
10.
A card for the
bank, sir, and it is?
An 8.
8, the bank wins.
Another round.
I don't like this
game, all you do is lose.
The bank now is
at 3,900 pounds.
Don't you find this
game boring, madam?
It's most dreary,
doesn't excite me at all.
[Host] Almost ready,
mark your bets, please.
The lady is changing games.
[Host] But that's
not possible.
This is simply outrageous,
what is happening here?
This game will
thrill you, madam.
Mr. Bigot.
(man screams)
Ladies and gentlemen, this new
game is called Find the Lady.
The 10s lose, the lady wins.
The 10s lose, the lady wins.
Now, watch the little
lady, the 10s lose,
and the lady wins.
Hard cash only, dollars,
pounds, no chips, please.
Watch the lady,
where has she gone?
Find the lady, place your bets.
That's the lady.
That's the lady?
I'm sorry, madam.
Here we go, again.
The 10s are losers,
the lady's a winner.
Keep your eyes on the game.
Now, watch the lady.
Don't let the 10s tempt
you, let the lady lure you.
One, two, three,
where can the lady be?
Oh, the one in the middle.
No chips, hard cash
only, dollars or pounds.
[Man] Here you go.
Find the lady, find the lady.
Yeah, what's our luck?
The 10s lose, the lady wins.
Place your bets.
Hundred pounds on that card.
Wait a minute.
It's not...
Hey!
The gentlemen lost control
and abused the lady,
but have no fear,
she'll reappear.
[Tom] She's beautiful.
(Tom whistling)
The other one.
No, not you.
Now, let's find the lady,
ladies and gentlemen.
The lady wins, the 10 loses.
One, two, three,
where can the lady be?
1,000 pounds on that card.
That's the end of that.
[Slim] The lady wins, but...
(crowd gasping)
What's the saying, Mr. Ormond?
The game is a game.
Here we go again,
ladies and gentlemen,
find your lady, 10s
lose, lady wins.
Quite a crowd.
Good evening.
[Slim] Once again
now, eye on the card.
Isn't it scandalous
letting blacks in?
But, sir, the
world is not divided
between blacks and whites,
but between rich and poor.
The 10s lose,
and the lady wins.
Hello.
The lady, the lady.
All the money
you have, I cover.
Tom, we lost.
I'm going to kill
you, I know it.
Well, we can always
start over again.
No, we can't.
Hey, I'll decide that.
No, we can't.
Shall we go.
(men screaming)
You bums.
Shut up.
[Ma] How's it coming, Eliza?
I declare you under arrest.
Charged with armed
attack, gambling,
the kidnapping of 54
people, swindling, smuggling
impersonating a gentleman,
and disturbing the peace,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
You managed to get
him into trouble?
Who, me?
Yeah, you.
Relax, relax.
(monkey laughing)
Hey, Slim, come here
and take a look.
What's to see?
(drumming)
(gentle melody)
(crowd murmuring)
Nice trial, huh?
[Jason] Well,
what did you expect?
That's enough, quiet you.
Can't you understand that
you've been condemned already?
What the hell has
he written there?
That we've been
condemned, but unjustly.
To say the least.
Is the hay ready?
Relax, Ma paid off the judges.
The court.
Who gave Ma the money
to pay off the judges?
Ma had some savings.
Savings?
She never told me.
There's been a change
(indistinct whispering)
Is the defense ready?
Yes, your honor.
Who's that?
Every trial has its lawyer.
Your honor, my
clients place themselves
at the mercy of the court.
Is the hay ready?
What?
Is the hay ready?
Well, I hope so.
You only hope so.
You can't do that.
Listen to me, I'm your lawyer.
If the law is corrupt,
take it in your hands, I say.
Your honor.
See you around, Tom.
See you around, huh?
Okay.
Okay, yeah.
Now, those are tough men
and I've always been
surrounded by jerks.
Did you call, Mr. Ormond?
Yes.
I was thinking of
doing something
for that poor fellow
condemned to life.
Nothing is worse than rotting
your life away in prison
and once you hear this case,
it would be a blessing.
One, two, three,
and it's all over.
You're too kind, Mr. Ormond.
Yeah, I know.
'Course, I'm
counting on the fact
that we'll trap the other one.
He would be a rotten coward
if he didn't try
to free his friend.
You're a genius, you think
of everything, Mr. Ormond.
Smiley.
They're coming to buy
the ivory animals.
This deal is worth
100,000 pounds
and I don't want the slightest
incident to queer it.
Welcome to Ormond's
Park, gentlemen.
Zurhing and?
Mr. Schultz.
How do you do, Mr. Schultz?
We'll hang him by the
throat, we'll kill him.
Hang him by the throat.
Get the noose, man.
I'll kill him, there he is.
There!
(mob yelling)
The trap's about to be sprung.
When his friend
shows up, you shoot.
He can only come from there
or there
or there.
Look out, earthquake.
Hi, Tom!
What are you doing here?
Nothing.
Just came for a visit.
Nice jail, huh, Tom?
What are you waiting
for, get me out.
Listen.
I could be wrong,
but I really think they're
going to lynch you.
Get me out, I said.
[Slim] How's that?
And stop acting like an idiot.
Don't tell me you're afraid.
[Tom] Me, afraid
of that bunch?
[Slimy] Let's lynch him.
Afraid?
Yes.
[Slim] All clear?
Go ahead.
Let's get him, let's get him.
Hey, what you doing?
Hey, let the grate loose,
let's not leave tracks.
Don't worry, it
doesn't touch the ground.
[Slim] Hang on.
(men singing)
Don't you think the animals
will have a difficult time
adapting themselves to Canada?
Going from a tropical
climate to a polar climate?
Not at all.
Canada's their natural habitat,
they get sick here.
The cold is good.
Yeah, do you really
think that's true?
I don't think so, I know so.
Meat is better preserved
when it's cold.
[Tom] Get off my feet.
[Slim] Well, fall
into step, will ya?
Get some steam up.
(whimsical music)
Out you go.
You hungry?
Yeah.
(steam whistle blowing)
All ashore.
[Ormond] Be right down.
Thank you, Mr. Ormond.
We'll be back in
about six months?
See you soon, Mr. Schultz.
[Schultz] Remember, we get
first bid on all the ivory.
[Ormond] You have my word
and that's even
better than ivory.
Bon voyage, captain.
Sir.
[Ormond] I'll be
going to shore now.
Why so soon?
It's a nice boat, Mr. Ormond.
Would you mind telling your men
to throw their
guns in the river?
Your guns, over the side.
And knives, too.
Chuck it over.
Is that everybody?
Tom, how are you doing?
Hey, Tom!
Who's this Tom?
[Tom] Me.
Will you kindly
tell the captain
there's going to be a delay?
Mind stepping over there?
[Tom] He was traveling light.
[Ormond] There's been an
unexpected delay, captain.
Go join the other punks.
Lower pressure.
(triumphant melody)
Looks good, huh?
It wasn't even loaded.
Stay where you are.
Are you a heavyweight?
Of course I am.
So is he.
(bell rings)
(suspenseful melody)
Why such a big deal?
It's your turn.
I'll take my chances
with the crocodiles.
Any crocodiles down there?
Just a few big ones.
Hey, you.
Your honor.
Hey, and you, too.
Lively, step lively.
Who's gonna pay for
renting the boat now?
They will.
Well, that'll be
a thousand pounds.
Double at least.
And you can double it again.
You don't want this
money to get wet, do ya?
You don't want us to...
Yes.
But I don't know how to swim.
You'll learn,
you'll learn, go on.
Hey, look who's still there.
He keeps losing his way.
[Slim] No, he likes you, Tom.
[Tom] Yeah?
Yeah.
Let's keep him.
And now what?
Weigh anchor.
I warn you, it's piracy.
And I'm warning
you to get started.
Where to?
The Maldives Islands.
You know where that is?
Nope.
Neither do I.
Set course for the
Maldives Islands, captain.
This won't end here.
This will end here.
