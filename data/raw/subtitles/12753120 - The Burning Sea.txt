I started working
in the North Sea at 18.
That was back in... '71.
A long time ago.
The oil business paid well.
So I started working two weeks on,
four weeks off.
We had no idea
what we were getting involved in.
Zero training.
Just follow the Americans.
If they said go left, we went left.
I remember it was dangerous
back then.
But it was a risk
we were willing to take.
Or, more precisely,
we didn't think much about it.
Everyone made money.
The entire country made money.
But...
it's like driving a car.
Drive too fast for too long
and it will never end well.
"A risk of undesirable incidents"
we call it in the oil business.
THE BURNING SEA
Good morning.
Hi.
- Good morning, Odin.
- Good morning.
Sleep well?
There's coffee in the thermos.
- Is it good?
- Yeah.
- Done!
- Are you done?
Yeah. Where is it?
I don't know. Go look for it.
I'm in no mood for a treasure hunt.
Check in the basement.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
- Where is what?
- A radio- controlled car.
What?
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.
- Eggs?
- Sure.
There's no way you can do it
in less than 30 seconds.
If I fail, you get to control the music
in the car for a month.
Deal.
No, shit.
A week. A week!
- Two weeks.
- One! I can't handle that much Kvelertak.
{\an8}- Fine, two weeks.
- Yes!
{\an8}EELUME OFFSHORE ROBOTICS
TEST POOL FOR UNDERWATER ROBOTS
- Ready?
- Yes.
Three, two, one... go!
Five seconds.
Ten.
Check!
Twenty.
Halfway.
- Shit! Dammit!
- Twenty- nine, 30.
What do you think about
a manual reset at 1000 meters?
- Raise it up.
- You give up?
I'm not giving up.
I'll do it next time.
Bye!
- Bye.
- See you later.
- Who's coming to the cookout?
- Oil people.
Nice people.
- Okay.
- It'll be fun.
What's in this bag?
Why is it so heavy?
- It isn't heavy.
- It weighs at least 15 kilos.
You have gamer arms.
No muscles.
Why don't you just move in?
- I'm not moving in with him.
- You've been dating for a year.
- Nine months.
- Many people move in after nine months.
Well, I don't.
You're going to move in
and buy a station wagon,
and I'll be stuck alone at the office.
- Never gonna happen.
- You'll need room for skis and bags.
I have my life and he has his.
Works like a charm.
- Hey there!
- Hi, Oddvar.
- On a diet?
- Yes.
Don't leave me standing alone.
- Want me to take that?
- Here.
- Hi, Arthur.
- Hi.
- Ski jumping is my hobby.
- Watching ski jumping, Ronny.
Sure, but still...
Hi, Odin, does your auntie get a hug?
Please?
Come on, give Aunt Vibeke a hug.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Check this out.
I'm fetching more beer.
Hi.
Hi.
Of course.
Who sent you two for beer?
Carry on.
I'll take care of it.
There.
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.
Come on, we're guarding you!
No!
Pass it!
Move!
Good night, Odin!
Bedtime.
Go, Arthur!
If it isn't the skinny- dipper!
- Oh, no...
- You look like hell.
- I feel horrible. Don't you?
- Not really. Stian made me breakfast.
Eggs and bacon and...
Want this?
Thank you!
This bag isn't so bad after all, huh?
Do you have a Coke
and a Whopper Cheese in there too?
Hello.
No, we're at work.
What?
Yes, but...
We'll be right there.
That was Saga.
There's been an accident.
They want us at the heliport now.
What kind of accident?
Grab the other bag.
{\an8}SOLA AIR STATION
MAIN BASE FOR RESCUE HELICOPTERS
- Is that everything?
- Yes.
- Hi.
- Hi.
My name is William Lie.
- Sofia Hartman.
- Sofia Hartman.
- Yes.
- I'm the emergency manager.
- Hi. William Lie.
- Hi.
- Arthur.
- Arthur. Hi.
What's happened?
Before anything,
I need you to sign this.
- Nondisclosure.
- A confidentiality agreement.
And time is of the essence.
Thank you.
You didn't answer me.
- What is our mission?
- The ship is waiting.
I'll contact you once you arrive.
We have a representative on board.
{\an8}M/S NORMAND MAXIMUS
SUBSEA SUPPLY SHIP
{\an8}ORMEN LANGE FIELD
PHASE 2 - UNDER DEVELOPMENT
{\an8}SAGA CONTROL ROOM
{\an8}REMOTE CONTROL AND MONITORING
OF OIL INSTALLATIONS
- Have they arrived?
- Yes, they are in position and ready.
Do we have a connection?
- Coming up on the screens now.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Jasin, can you give us audio?
- Hi, we're all set on deck.
- Hi.
They're in position.
Sofia, this is Berit.
Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
- I have William Lie here.
Listen up.
A platform has gone down.
Most likely due to a local subsidence
of the sea floor.
Wasn't Ekofisk only
a few inches a year?
But this time the subsidence occurred
right under a platform leg.
Did you get the schematics we sent?
- Affirmative.
- Good.
Can you use them to navigate?
Depends what we're looking for.
We're looking for missing persons.
Since it went down so fast,
we expect air pockets.
We need to find out if anyone is alive.
So we're looking for people?
Correct.
We want your robot
to make its way inside
and search for survivors.
- We'll try.
- Thank you.
Operating room to crane.
Prepare for release.
Copy that.
Online.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Release in three, two, one...
- Can you start recording?
- Already on.
Heading 45.
Trying to find a way in here.
We're at 4 and 45 degrees.
- And 120.
- I'm following those pipes.
- Do you see an opening?
- There should be a shaft to starboard.
Seventy-five meters.
I see a door.
Can you open it?
Let's try.
We can try.
Jasin, can you ID him?
On it.
Transmitting now.
Continuing inside.
- Now what?
- Steady...
Two seconds.
We have another body.
Hear that?
- Do you?
- I hear it.
He's alive. Report that we have
a person alive in an air pocket.
Operations to Control.
Do you see what we see?
A person in an air pocket.
Berit.
Jasin, contact the standby boat.
What do they want us to do?
Control to Operations.
Hello?
Help. Help!
Hello?
I'm alive!
Get me out of here! Help!
- What's that?
- What should we do?
We have sonar interference.
What is that?
What's that sound?
Is that a leak?
Berit?
We've shut off all the valves.
It isn't from us.
Help!
What is this?
Turn off the audio!
Get me out of here!
The rig is leaking gas!
- Get Eelie out of there!
- Sofia?
What do I do with him?
The rig is leaking gas!
We have to get out of here!
Hurry, we have to...
Eight deaths
have been confirmed so far.
Our thoughts go to the next of kin.
{\an8}The rescue operation will continue.
{\an8}And we promise to come back later
{\an8}with more information.
{\an8}That was Oil and Energy Minister
Steinar Skagemo...
{\an8}Where are you?
{\an8}In some hallway on the sixth floor.
Hi.
Hi.
- Hi.
- My god...
Are you okay?
Christ.
What happened?
Look at you.
I'm okay.
Let's...
Hey...
What happened?
It was just so horrible.
Can I stay with you for a few days?
Of course.
I don't want to be alone.
You can stay with me
as long as you want.
Let's go home.
Okay?
We ran a simulation.
The rig went down
in 2 minutes and 47 seconds.
There's no way
that could have been a subsidence.
Christ!
- No one else could take my shift.
- It's okay.
I have the mini version of you here.
That you do.
Know what?
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Odin?
I'm leaving.
Want to say bye?
Can daddy get a hug?
Bye.
- Bye.
- Have a nice trip.
Thanks.
Want to go in and fix that car?
- Yeah.
- Yes!
This will be fun!
See that little screw? Here?
Try tightening it.
- Hi, Arthur.
- Hi. You need to get out here.
Okay, what's up?
{\an8}GULLFAKS A
220 KM FROM THE COAST
- Hi there.
- Hi.
- Reading glasses?
- Shut up.
How is Sofia doing?
She'll be fine.
There was talk of a gas explosion?
Yeah. A leak from a well.
One well?
That's what they say, so...
I don't know.
But she'll be fine.
- She's tough.
- Good.
- How's the mood here?
- There's some talk.
People are a little shaky,
but everything's fine.
Of course.
Good.
I'd better make my rounds.
Okay.
What is it with you?
- What is it?
- Nothing.
- Stop it.
- Looking forward to my rounds.
Hey!
What is it?
Huh?
Sofia and I have been talking.
She's moving in with me and Odin.
Seriously? That's great.
- Yeah.
- You deserve it.
A new start.
Yes, it is a new start.
I have a recording
from after the explosion.
This is from the camera in front.
What we saw.
But...
if I switch to the rear camera...
Huh? Rewind.
No way that's a leak from a well.
Christ, it just keeps going!
- We'll wait here.
- Yeah.
Excuse me. Lie?
It's okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I haven't had a break in 12 hours.
Can we talk while I eat?
That isn't a leak from a well.
Migrating gas isn't uncommon
in the North Sea.
But the entire area exploded.
That much gas at the same time?
Something has to be seriously wrong.
And there's no way
that can be subsidence.
Maybe we should leave that
to the specialists.
May I borrow that?
Sure.
Thank you.
Are you leaving?
There are thousands of workers out there.
They have a right to know what's going on!
You have to say something.
Remember that you signed
a nondisclosure agreement.
What did they say?
I'm not sure.
- Did you show them the clip?
- I showed it to William Lie.
- And what did he say?
- He didn't say much.
- He took the hard drive and left.
- Okay?
That's good. They'll look at it
and figure out what to do.
- How is the pressure?
- Up and down, but good now.
There was some differential sticking
and we may have a dogleg,
but it seems to be okay.
{\an8}SAGA STAVANGER
HEADQUARTERS FOR OFFSHORE OPERATIONS
Hi, Gunn.
Oil and Energy Minister Skagemo is here.
Steinar Skagemo.
Thank you for coming
at such short notice.
We have had a dramatic development
over the last 48 hours.
William.
The number of fractures and slides
has increased.
The platform that went down
has been inspected.
And today we received
video footage of a fracture
larger than anything
we have previously seen.
Much larger.
If you look here...
If this is the center of the fracture,
where expansion is largest,
we're talking about a rift
several kilometers long.
Possibly tens of kilometers.
Which means?
Where did this rift come from?
Oddvar?
Here are the platforms in the North Sea.
Here is Storegga.
Eight-thousand years ago
the Storegga Slide occurred here.
Five-thousand cubic kilometers of mud,
stone and sand dislodged.
The slides we have registered now
are in a direct line with Storegga.
And?
At first we thought
it was a local subsidence.
But not anymore.
If you look at this video...
What are we looking at?
Part of a larger slide.
If you look closely...
the seabed disappears.
The Storegga Slide.
It has started moving again.
How big?
Exactly how big is difficult to say.
But it could be bigger
than anything registered
in modern times.
In an area full of platforms?
And people. Yes.
- Why is this happening now?
- We don't know.
There may be many factors.
It could be climate change,
there could be other causes.
It may even be
that we set it off ourselves.
What do you mean?
We've drilled thousands of wells
out there.
Drained massive oil and gas reserves
under the ocean floor.
Turned it into Swiss cheese.
Let's get back to this situation.
Good idea.
What do you suggest?
Shut down all operations in the area.
Secure and close down all wells.
Until we know more.
If we don't shut down the wells,
what might happen?
Look here, Skagemo.
This is the casing.
A type of holster.
It is anchored to the seabed.
The drill goes in there.
If the rig collapses
and pulls the drill out like this...
the oil will flow freely.
How large of a spill
might we be talking?
Remember Deepwater Horizon?
Yes.
That spill was the size of Denmark.
From one well. Here we have 350.
We are faced with an enormous task.
No one has experienced this before.
No one has rehearsed for this.
The Joint Rescue Coordination Center
will handle the evacuation.
Our task is to secure and close down
half the North Sea.
In order to succeed...
to close down every well,
secure every installation.
We all have to do our utmost.
We're short on time, but cannot panic.
Security is priority number one.
Every platform on the red list
is to be secured and shut down.
I know as much as you do.
Many people are evacuating.
Renate, can you check that?
I know as much as you do.
We'll just take it nice and easy.
Who owns that belt?
Put it in one of the boxes.
Which ones are left?
Status on Statfjord A?
Shutting down Statfjord A now.
Excellent.
Okay.
Good. And Oseberg?
Oseberg A and D are secured.
B is almost ready.
All crews are being shuttled
to Normand Vision.
Get ready, Group A.
- Kjell Are Heiland.
- Yes.
- Terje Hamar.
- Here.
- Henning Sirnes...
-Yes.
- and Eva Fjørtoft.
- Yes.
Good.
Follow Renate up on deck.
- Follow me.
- Excellent.
Find out who it is,
and send it to me.
- Is the valve on Troll fixed?
- Troll A?
It's green.
Troll is closed.
Continue down the list.
The entire Statfjord field is green.
Keep it up.
And now for some breaking news.
Unconfirmed sources say
a large-scale evacuation
of oil platforms is underway.
The oil industry
has yet to confirm this publicly.
Let's go live to the
Joint Rescue Coordination Center,
where there is hectic activity.
All emergency services,
including ambulance,
police and fire, are at the ready.
So far, we can ascertain that...
STIAN: DON'T WORRY!
WE'RE BEING EVACUATED.
... cooperation among the agencies
has been satisfactory.
Of course, this operation
is on an unprecedented scale,
but so far...
I'm getting an error message
from a well on Gullfaks A.
Maybe it's a little slow?
Something's wrong with
the connection.
Call the platform chief.
- It's Helseth, right?
- Yep.
Okay, our turn. Group F.
We get to turn the lights out.
Ready?
Ronny Helseth.
Seriously?
We're in the middle of an evacuation.
Okay, I'll see what I can do.
They can't contact Well 4.
Can't close it from HQ.
We can't leave until
all the wells are secured.
That's why they want me to go down
and close it manually.
You have to
keep an eye on things here.
I'll go down.
- I'll go down the D shaft and fix it.
- Okay.
But hurry.
- Hold the bus for me.
- Yeah, yeah.
The evacuation began around 4:30 pm.
Around 150 individuals.
It went without a hitch...
The subscriber cannot be reached.
- Status on Gjøa?
- Working on the last wells now.
How about that valve on Gullfaks?
It takes time to get down there.
Stian, the bus has arrived.
Roger. Almost down.
{\an8}D SHAFT, GULLFAKS A
138 METERS UNDER THE SEA
What the hell?
Shit!
We lost contact.
- With who?
- The entire platform.
Not just that one.
Not just that one!
Are-- are yours also down?
Stian, it's time.
Let's go.
Roger.
Closing the valve now.
Come on, get in!
Get in!
Stian, get up here!
Come on!
Come on! Get in!
You have reached Berit Djuphagen.
Please leave a message.
Berit, it's Sofia Hartman.
I've been trying to call you.
I'm on my way to you now.
I'll let you know when I'm there.
We're here to see Berit Djuphagen.
- You have an appointment?
- Yes.
We can talk in here.
Odin, could you go sit over there?
I can't reach Stian.
- He isn't answering.
- Sofia...
We couldn't close all the wells
on Gullfaks A remotely, so...
Stian was sent down
to do it manually.
I just talked to Ronny.
And...
they didn't have time to...
Stian was never evacuated.
He texted me.
Said he was being evacuated.
Over 30 platforms just collapsed.
Gullfaks was one of the first
to be hit. A leg was ripped off.
And Stian was down there.
Find out which lifeboats
are still out there.
Stian Birkeland is still on Gullfaks A.
You have to send someone out to get him.
That is Gullfaks A.
Status red.
It has lost one of its legs.
It can collapse and sink at any moment.
I'm sorry.
You sent him down there.
It's your responsibility to get him out.
I'm afraid I must ask you to leave.
No.
No!
I'm not going anywhere
until you rescue him!
I can't send a rescue team
out there now.
We have to prioritize.
There's a little boy out there
who's going to lose his father!
Call security.
Aren't you going to do anything?
No? Then you go tell
that little boy
that no one intends to do anything
to save his father.
I'm not doing it.
Sofia.
No.
Where is that link I asked for?
Has something happened to dad?
Yes.
Sort of.
Can you wait here?
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
You have cameras everywhere
on the platforms.
- Yes, in most rooms.
- Show me those images.
- Sofia...
- I need to see them.
Now!
We don't have cameras in
all the mechanical rooms.
Let me fast- forward.
No!
Sofia...
But he wrote
that he was being evacuated.
Berit?
Look at this.
Huh?
A hatch into a service chute
has been opened.
What does that mean?
Most likely it was ripped open
when the platform was hit.
Could Stian have opened it?
It's highly unlikely that he...
Watch Odin for me.
Sofia?
Hi, Vibeke, it's Sofia.
I need your help.
- I only need the mini.
- Okay.
- Where do you think he is?
- There are pipes between the legs.
Seriously, Sofia...
Is this even legal?
- You both have suits?
- I'm going alone.
Okay. Officially,
we're on a different mission.
Sofia?
- What choice do I have?
- Well, you sure aren't going alone.
Over there is Gullfaks A.
The deck is gone,
so we'll have to lower you down.
I'll go first, then the equipment,
then I'll help you down.
Arthur, it'll be okay.
Just don't look down.
Get ready, and get out quick
when I give the signal.
Yeah!
We have to get out of here fast.
Just find Stian, okay?
Find my brother.
Arthur, don't worry.
Are you okay?
- Yes.
- Okay.
Okay?
Here.
Okay.
- We must be here.
- Yeah.
- Don't you think?
- Yes.
Let's start there.
Okay. Hang on.
- Come on!
- Okay.
And Sofia went out there?
They refused to send anyone.
Didn't want to risk any more lives.
So she just went.
- Hi, Odin.
- Hi.
How's it going?
Fine.
Can I get a hug?
We have to go down there.
We have to drop it.
- Can it withstand that?
- It has to.
Ready?
Three, two...
one.
We're on.
It seems to be working.
Turn on the thermal camera.
I'm going in between these pipes.
He's alive!
Oddvar.
It can't be!
They're from ten minutes ago.
How can they be wrong?
{\an8}JET FALCON DA- 20
MARITIME SURVEILLANCE
The slide has ripped open
the oil pipelines.
The black you see here is oil.
And the wind isn't on our side.
The oil slick is moving toward the coast.
How big is it?
Approximately 100,000 square kilometers.
And growing.
Gunn, what is the worst- case scenario?
Norway's entire western coast
will be devastated.
Molde, Ålesund, Bergen,
Haugesund, Stavanger.
Every fjord,
every nook and cranny.
Birds.
Fish.
All fauna. Nature.
All aquaculture ruined.
The fishing industry. Tourism.
It will take...
decades to repair the damage,
maybe a century.
And then...
it will continue down this way,
expanding toward Denmark,
Germany, the Netherlands, Britain...
What can we do
to limit the damage?
We have contacted NOFO,
the Coastal Administration,
local authorities.
They are all on high alert,
but no one is prepared for
anything on this scale.
How long do we have?
It won't make landfall
until sometime tomorrow night,
but when it does...
There is another option.
But we'd have to act now.
It's never been done
on this large a scale.
But right now
the slick is concentrated.
And the oil is still thick enough.
Thick enough for what?
Setting it on fire.
This slick is too big
for an in-situ burning.
The consequences...
The consequences will be less
than what you just outlined.
I can't make this decision alone.
Here.
It should be here.
- Which one?
- E601B, there.
Stian?
Stian?
Stian?
Stian?
Stian?
Sofia?
Sofia!
Hi!
You're alive!
- Can you get up here?
- No.
- I need a wrench!
- Yeah.
- Are you hurt?
- Yes.
- We have to get you out.
- Okay.
- Find anything?
- Yes.
Sofia, we have to get out of here!
Are you okay?
I have spoken to the prime minister
and the cabinet.
Let's do it.
Set it on fire.
You can set up here.
William, we'll get an image now.
Good.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
- Let me call Vibeke.
- Yeah.
Sofia?
Ronny?
They're setting fire to the oil slick.
- Is Gullfaks...
- Right in the middle.
Wait here.
- What floor?
- Fourth.
Stop!
Stop! Sofia Hartman
went out to Gullfaks A!
What was that?
There are people out there.
Shit.
She isn't answering.
Try Saga.
William?
William, a Stian Birkeland is on the line.
This is William Lie.
Stian Birkeland here.
We're on Gullfaks A.
You have to send someone to get us.
Birkeland, listen carefully.
What is it?
Stian?
What are they saying?
What is it?
Stian?
They bombed the oil slick.
Set fire to it.
The flames will reach us
in five minutes.
No one is coming to get us.
Is his son here?
Stian?
Sofia, what do we do?
Stian?
Lifeboats.
Are there lifeboats here?
- Lifeboats!
- Down there.
We have to get down there.
Arthur!
I'll wait here.
No.
I think it's time to... leave now.
Sofia told me to wait here.
Then we will.
Sofia?
We have to fill it with water.
Sofia, what are we doing?
We'll fill it with water
and dive under the flames.
- Okay?
- Yes.
You wait here.
Sofia, take this.
Arthur!
Take this.
- Stick it in the boat. I'll get another.
- Yeah.
Once they fill with water,
open both valves.
Okay.
"Once they fill with water,
open both valves."
How much should I fill?
Sofia!
- How much?
- I don't know.
Arthur, pull it up. Pull it up!
- This?
- Yes. Up.
A little more. A little more.
Okay, that's enough!
Wait!
- Come on!
- It's stuck!
- Come on!
- Hang on.
Sofia?
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
Get in!
Buckle up.
- What now?
- Turn that red screw.
- This one?
- Yes.
And then pull the release.
- Okay. Ready?
- Yes.
- Nothing's happening.
- Pull it again!
Come on!
Shit.
- Did you pull the lever all the way up?
- Yes.
One of them is down.
- It has to be up.
- Okay.
No, stop!
It'll launch as soon as you pull it!
You won't make it back.
No!
No, Arthur!
No, Arthur, don't!
Arthur, stop!
- No, come back!
- Arthur!
No, sit down!
Sit down!
Stian!
Stian.
Stian...
Stian...
Stian, where's the pump?
Stian!
No!
No!
Stian.
Pump.
You have to pump.
I tried. It doesn't work.
I'm sorry.
Try opening... the valve.
Black handle.
Black handle.
Yes!
Stian!
It's working!
Hello?
This is Ronny.
Hi, Ronny. It's Stian.
I can't believe it!
Where are you?
We're in a lifeboat.
- By the platform.
- We're coming.
- We're on our way.
- Ronny?
Is Odin there?
Yes, hang on.
It's for you.
Hello?
Hi, Odin.
It's Dad.
Dad!
How are you?

Yes.
We're coming home.

It took almost a year
for the smoke to clear.
Ten thousand billion kroner

And nature said stop.
We thought we were an oil nation.
But what we really are,
is an ocean nation.
