This is the cosmos
as we know it.
Your planet, Earth,
the third counting from the sun.
And after the earth, come
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
Neptune, Uranus and Pluto.
And beyond, in the distance ...
No, no farther.
Much further.
Wait ... there.
At the very edge of the galaxy,
is our world
the call planetita
Spenger.
For many decades,
I was king of this planet.
People were happy
and their lives were good.
But, however, were also
a planet of idiots
and one day, the evil villain,
bloodthirsty
and feared that our planet
had seen
took power, made me a prisoner,
and gave its name to the planet.
His name?
Spenger Tod.
Well, help me up.
Hurry.
Well, Let me go.
Very well, then it is not
exactly reckless
but we certainly took
by surprise.
Afire General, how soon?
The death ray is ready,
Great.
Excellent.
Did I mention that we were
a planet of idiots?
Open the dome.
Spenger put all our resources
to create a weapon ...
the powerful laser beam
death.
Its aim:.
Ia destruction of Earth.
Earth, you think so great
so important.
Soon there will be more
that space dust,
and my world will be the largest
of the universe.
Lord, we calculated the point
planet's most vulnerable.
It is a place that earthlings call
Woodland Hills, California.
Woodland Hills.
Show Woodland Hills.
Show me the exact point where
almighty stick my death ray.
As you wish, sir.
Wait. Wait, stop.
My God.
It is the most beautiful creature
of the universe.
Look at those legs
and these curves,
and how it moves.
Enough, stop it.
Stop torture
with those turns lusty.
Oh, goddess of desire.
Affirm,
I have this woman.
But sir, your planet
is about to be destroyed.
Then wait a day.
Bring me this woman.
Tomorrow will destroy the Earth.
- Yes, sir.
- General.
Lord.
What about me?
You are great and powerful,
Lord Tod.
Tomorrow, my love ...
tomorrow ...
you'll be mine.
My world and theirs were
in grave danger.
This was only the intervention
fortuitous
of the two heroes wiser,
most courageous and noble than
universe has ever known.
These are your father and I
in the Plaza de Ensenada.
Yes, just before they lost
luggage.
I tried to do go overboard, but ...
No. Living Waters,
sharks, sawfish,
And who knows what else they
down there?
The donkey ride.
It really broke my back.
That's my kind of place ...
no insects, no food crazy ...
Dick.
And that's all.

I told him boring.

I hope not. On the roof.
Dick, try to have fun

Marge, do not want to have fun.
I do not want to go dancing or eating food

I just want to sit in one place
and rest.
Okay.
Look, Dick, is the old way

I always wanted to try it.
Look, do not take a path

The coffee is ready.
I think they'll like.
Coffee?
This is our daughter, Stephanie.
And your little boyfriend, Carl.
And that is our son, Alan.
Is facing a crisis.
And that's my husband, Dick.
Yes, indeed.
Alan is really
a very good boy.
Just passing through a difficult age,
but what we love.
Who are your pets?
Ah, I see, is your family.
These should be your children.
They are adorable.
Simply adorable.
Is your husband?
I see. Are they separate?
Now do not get along,
Is that it?
Well ...
May not be communicating.
Maybe I should talk to him, right?
Very well, then I will.

It looks spectacular.
Yes It's true, right?
Well, I accompany them.
Now get out.
Oh, mother, if only you could
be here.
No.
No. No, please.
The milking of minds

Sucks the brain.
It brings thoughts
and step on the brain y. ..
Who are you?
Dick Nelson, Earth.
Is the Earth? Ah, yes.
I am Raff.
What did I just say?
- "I am Raff."
- No.
I am Raff, you are Earth-Dick.
Listen, Earth-Dick,
I have vital information
for the future of your planet
and mine.
- Am I talking about?
- Yes
Well. Show me when to stop.
Stopped.
It's all due to Spenger.
I ... was king of this planet
when he seized power.
I stole the ideas
and misused
to build their ...
- Telescope?
- No, no, its ...
Rod.
No, no, its ...
- Beach ball.
- No. Her death ray.
- Ray of death?
- I say.
Then Earth-Dick.
This is very important.
Open my pants.
- What?
- Fast, is urgent.
I have not enough time in prison
for this.
No, no, no vital information
for the cause in my pants.
Now, open my pants, making
information and escapes.
"Escape?
How am I supposed to escape?
I have no idea,
but you'll think of something.
After all,
this is a planet of idiots.
I mean, look at me.
I am the most intelligent of all
and I'm an idiot.
Well, well, Keep it, I ...
a moment.
You take it to my son
Sirk on ...
Sirk on ...
Oh, damn.
Sirk on ...
"Leader?
- General?
- No.
The White Ave.
Ah, the White Ave.
Sure, yes.
- And then ...
- Yes?
Just at the wrong time ...
I swoon.
White Ave. Sure, yes,
well, super.
Fantastic.
I sounded.
And high.
This is fantastic.
Heaven.
It's beautiful.
Excuse me, my husband is here?

"Tod, O Tod"
"It's a god" diósico "
"Bold and courageous'
"Our future will save
and for posterity "
"It will be your name, Tod."
Sincerely, Marge Nelson.
Tod am the Destroyer.
I love everything you see.
Are you impressed?
Yes, it has a planetita
absolutely adorable.
Do you think my world is small?
Ah, yes, it's ... tiny.
I'll let you know, Marge Nelson, who
is the size of your planet,
but how you use it.
Sorry, could do it again?
I think I misjudged the distance.
Thanks.
Now, what did
its planetita?
Do not you understand?
I am the emperor.
I rule this place.
Tod ...
Are you insecure?
Me? "Lnseguro?
If unsure,
Why talk so loud?
And now, dear Marge?
What about me?
Mr. Spenger, where's Dick?
Why do you care about him?
Do you have a planet with its name?
"Dick is called Earth?
Mr. Spenger, where is my husband?
What happens here?
What it does
Marry me, Marge, and become
Spenger Queen.
Marry you? I can not
I'm married.
So? Would not you rather be a queen?
Tod, where is my husband?
In the dungeon, where rot
while your planet
is destroyed before their eyes.
Right. Tomorrow
first thing
Earth fly,
Spenger turning on the planet
most powerful in the universe.
Mr. Spenger, demanded that I take
with my husband immediately.
I'll make my own, Marge Nelson.
- I love it.
- Never, ever will love.
- I love my husband.
- Okay. All right.
The release you.
I'll bring it to the lab
and will milk his mind.
Find out what's in it for
deserve your love for him.
Take her away.
Tod, let alone my husband.
- Okay, guys.
- Get in there.
Can not we talk?
Animals.
Okay, okay.
Wait a second.
You are ...
Blaaattt, right?
I saw your picture. You ...
BWAA's husband.
Want a granola bar?
"Gra-no-la?
Do it.
"My back.
It kills me back. "
This idiot Spenger
laughs at me.
I would punch him in the mouth,
but if I do, someone
hit me in the mouth to me. "
- Yes.
- "What I have in my mouth?
I have granola in the teeth.
Marge gave me granola in the car.
Marge.
"Marge is in trouble?
"Marge ... is dead?
I knew we should have
been on the freeway, I told him.
I heard, nobody does,
even my son. "
Even your own son believes
you're a jerk.
"My God, let the fire
lit.
All our stuff.
The memories of 20 years.
Photos of Marge. "
- What the hell is this?
- "Oh, Marge.
Is looking for me.
Is worried.
Oh, Marge. Marge. Marge. "
Well, enough said.
Enough.
It is enough, enough ...
enough, idiot.
Me.
Forget it. Wake up, wake up.
Marge Nelson must have
the heart of an angel
because only an angel could love
a pathetic weakling like you.
What did she?
What did my wife?
- Run.
- If you touch my wife,
I'll strip the head pointed,
zero.
You hear me?
Come on, I kill you.
You think I'm weak? I used
play soccer. Come on.
Come on.
Rays.
Yes, it is difficult to have to be male
all the time, right?
Sometimes my husband insists
something both
it difficult to accept
his mistake.
What you need is a hug, right?
Good boy.
What a good boy.
That's right.
Do not you feel better
if you were to talk to BWAA?
If you said you believe in it
and you love her?
She should also
say the same thing.
Do not you think you should go
to talk to her now?
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Yes, okay.
Heaven, heaven.
BWAA.
Heaven, heaven.
- It hurts, right?
- Yes, yours is as big as ...
No, I miss the love.
There is pain,
but we must move forward,
as I do now.
This is my duty.
But ... but ...
is that I can not.
Okay.
We'll be fine.
No, you have to escape.
You get out of here.
Toma, you can take
my uniform.
You can dress up as a destroyer.
Take my helmet.
Why do it?
You might not know it,
Man of the Earth
but the love you feel for your wife
is eternal and beautiful.
Who ever loved in this way
knows.
I too had once
a true love,
but I lost it long ago.
This will not happen, man
Earth.
Quick, hurry.
- Hello. Excuse me.
- Hello.
Health, Tod.
Tod the Destroyer.
The uniform is small.
I ordered a new one.
What's your name?
Zurg.
Where are you going?
- A patrol.
- What region?
Is North?
Well, go ahead.
The so-Raff was right.
These people are idiots.
Shoot him.
Eggs burned.
I am a billion miles
chiropractic.
What the hell is that?
You are a beautiful creature.
No. No, heavens.
Socorro. Oh, God.
I pursue murderers fungi.
Come on, Dick, you can
shoulder strength.
Maybe not.
Where are the rooms
milking minds?
Catch him.
Dick, relief.
Socorro. Dick.
Dick, help me.
Marge.
I'm coming, Margie.
Take off the road.
Switch it off.
There it is.
Oh, Dick.
These people do not know
how to treat their guests.
Then Marge Nelson ...
back to us.
That's right. There it is.
Let it go.
Maybe my arm is too strong.
And maybe my legs are too
agile.
Thanks.
- Let me go.
- Marge.
Castíguenlo.
Basta.
Stop.
Now, Marge Nelson ...
you will witness the true power.
Tod, you were right.
Dick is nothing compared to you.
You are brave and strong ...
powerful.
Dick is small and insignificant
as all men
of the Earth.
"Marge?
I guess he made his decision.
Farewell, man of Earth.
Heaven.
- Wonderful.
- There they go.
Come on, shoot him.
Heaven.
Should be similar to a car, right?
Well, well. Ignition
acceleration
brakes, steering ...
Shoot the missiles.
Derríbenlo.
For heaven's sake.
What hit him?
Forward, forward ...
Below. Down for me.
O-10 six.

- Ready.
O-10 four.
Aim.
O-10 one. Fire.
Ejection.
I pressed everything but ...
What do you think of me now?
"Oh, Tod, O Tod
You are a god of glory "
- "Bold and brave ..."
- Help me, help me.
I hate it, horrible man,
dreadful and terrible.
Prepare it for our wedding
tomorrow morning.
- Yes, sir.
- If you marry me not by choice
Io do for the force.
Take her away.
Come on, guys, dance with me.
"Oh, Tod, O Tod
You are a glorious God. "
Damn.
Heaven.
Sorry, how, Marge?
No, you look beautiful.
No, you look beautiful.
What? Do you think I have
best beard?
Okay.
This'll love.
Could exercise.
Close your eyes.
One
Two.
And 50.
Yes
Listen.
I give up.
Oh, Dick.
Goodbye, Dick.
I loved you.
No. I must save Marge.
But I told them that I am not
Destroyer.
I'm Dick Nelson,
Woodland Hills, California.
Phone 818-348 ...
For ruining our world,
by exiled to the desert
by killing our noble father
King Raff.
For these crimes against our
planet Destroyer
- Fear that you must die.
- Wait.
Are you Sirk?
How do you know my name?
Your father was imprisoned.
We share a cell.
- Our father lives?
- Yes, yes.
Even gave me something to give them.
Where is it?
Open my pants.
If you know Dad.
Since the beginning of the reign
Spenge, my sister and I
and all our people were
pursued by the Destroyers.
So when we travel,
use these masks,
to dress the bird.
Sorry.
Do they really have this bird
size on your planet?
So why cheat
someone if they use those masks?
You are a wise man, Dick Nelson.
Qui-pi-te-pen-is-pe la-pa
more-pa-ca-pa-ra-pa.
No one has escaped from the fortress
Live dark.
You must be a man
very brave.
Yeah, well, I need to go back there
as soon as possible.
Is there any way you can help me?
We've spent years trying,
but Spenger has many weapons.
We are only armed
with our intelligence.
- What a shame.
- Yes
We are not smart people,
but what we lack in brain
offset in good intentions.
- Yes
- Maybe this will help.
Is a detailed description
the strength of Spenger.
Wait, wait.
Is a detailed description
cell of our father.
We are defeated.
"Defeated? What do they talk?
My wife is there, his father.
They can not surrender.
They are idiots, who cares?
They are too.
The does not mean they are stupid
can not rule a planet.
Hey, come to Earth sometime.
Do not give up.
Never surrender.
What would happen to surrender
Washington at Valley Forge?
What if Roosevelt had surrendered
San Juan Hill?
What if the moon had given Namib
Nomolos ice?
- Yes
- Thus, in the tradition of Washington,
Roosevelt and Namib
let's do it.
Yes Yes
Gosh, wait a minute.
Yes Let. Remember
Washington at San Juan Hill.
- Wait a minute.
- Wait, wait.
My people, wait for me.
Sirk, do not you think we should ...
prepare or something?
Dick Nelson, are a gift
the sky.
My people.
We'll go tomorrow.
Enter and arrange
things.
And now, Earth ...
goodbye.
I'm sick of target shooting.
I can not wait to fly it
really.
Yes
Tomorrow, Earth, everything will
finished
and no one can stop me.
Your plans are bright,
Man of the Earth.
Well, I came
some things.
Come, my people are anxious
to show you their progress.
Dick Nelson of Woodland Hills.
Health.
Continue.
Look, they stole their weapons
the Destroyers.
Have you ever seen one of these?
- It looks like a grenade.
- It's a light grenade.
If you take away the insurance
and support,
who collect ...
The grenade and the person is
disappears.
It's the dumbest thing ever heard.
Who would pick?
- Look.
- "Pick me."
Diabolical, no?
This is one of our weapons.
- It's a rock.
- Exactly.
What you do is lift
and arm
and then ... Ia throw.
Yes, I understood.
Come, we have prepared a feast
pre-battle, big Dick.
Prepare specialty
the planet.
Lub-lub spicy
high in fat.
I ...
The leader must take
the first bite.
What the hell.
No, no, I do not dance.
This music is in your honor.
You dance with them.
I really do not dance.
Hello.
His girlfriend is changing
Lord Tod.
Give him the love potion.
Yo I'm coming.
Hey, what do you think?
What do you prefer.
Ias pin or a goatee?
Be honest.
Are the pins, my lord?
No, no, I like
the goatee.
Nonsense in his head.
Now.
And you?
Sideburns.
Metro idiots.
You know, they're right.
Damn you all. Now.
- Monsters, horrible ...
- Silence.
I keep silent about the fact ...
- I said quietly.
-... That killed my husband.
Listen and do what I say,
your life may depend on it.
Spenger believes it is potion of love
but replaced it with water.
When you inject, you must act
like I was in love with him.
After the wedding, look for her husband
in the desert.
- My husband died, thanks.
- Silence.
I have reason to believe
to be ejected from the ship.
You say ... he's alive?
Maybe.
And if so,
is the only person who can save
this planet
the misguided tyranny
Spenge.
"Misguided?
Was there a fortress before
that I came to power?
Was there a magna-ray?
Was there a death ray? No.
This planet was nothing.
It was a cosmic zero.
Now, starting tomorrow,
dominate the universe.
You.
You will become my queen.
Never love you, idiot.
Yes you will.
Oh, Tod.
Marry me now.
And as for you,
Death is too good ia
for a traitor.
After the wedding, we will take
Command Center,
and you insert
the death ray.
We will look at death
while we die on Earth.
So ...
What do you think of me now, Afire?
I think it's an idiot short,
pathetic and insignificant.
