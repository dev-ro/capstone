Deirdre.
Hello, Princess.
Deirdre, do you know
what day it is today?
What day, Baby?
You know.
I'm such a mess.
Don't you come i n here...
with your hot greasy bags
and tease me.
Sweetie.
Honey Bunny.
I love you.
Don't tease me, Baby.
Come on Michael.
I'm hungry.
Come on Baby.
Say it.
Feed me.
Say it again.
Feed me.
"Cherish is the word
I use to describe"
"All the feeling that I have
hiding here for you inside"
We're going in.
Move into position now.
Move into position now.
You're gonna love
international policing.
This is the way it ends.
Not with a bang but a whimper.
Phillip, come over here.
Phillip.
Listen. We're only along for the ride.
This is their business.
It's my work that got us here.
You're one of the best
we've got with a mouse...
and a keyboard and you
want to be Dirty Harry?
Now let me be the first to go
in there and see this freak.
Let me finish it this time.
If you hadrt loaned him to us we'd
be two years behind already.
Fuck it! Why not?
Walk into hell.
Give it to me.
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no...
It's my body.
I want to be eaten.
I can do what I like.
I want to be eaten!
I want to be eaten.
I want to be eaten.
"Yummy, Yummy, Yummy."
"I got love in my tummy,"
"And I feel like lovir you."
"Love, you're such a sweet thing,"
"Good enough for eating"
"And that's what I'm gonna do."
"Oh love, to hug ya,
Oh love, to kiss ya,"
"Oh love, I love it so."
"Oh love, you're sweeter,"
"Sweeter than sugar."
Your skin is like crushed velvet.
It's so soft, silky...
and delicious.
I could lose myself in your body.
And never be found.
You make me so happy.
Hey!
- I missed you.
- I missed you.
Thanks for picking me up.
You told me not to
come and pick you up.
You've got my car.
Is that I ike a little test?
You tel I me not to come but you
expect me to be there anyway?
I'm sorry.
I had a long flight.
I got you a present.
I go away for a few months
you pierce your clit?
Four months.
You were gone for four months, baby.
I'm glad it wasrt any longer.
You used to love these
little surprises.
This... consult me about it.
Consult you about it?
Since when did I give
you ownership rights?
- Since you moved in here.
- No, Phillip.
You do what you want
and I do what I want, right?
Your problem is you don't trust me.
You think because
I fuck other people...
that I'm going to run off.
Well, I'm sorry but
I fucked three other guys...
and two other girls
while you were away...
and I'm still here...
and I'm waiting for
you to come home.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Are you back now?
Are you?
Whatever.
Okay.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Going up now.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Stay still there Baby.
Yes.
- Oh my!
- What?
Six hundred and two pounds.
We did it.
And you are flying in mid air.
Where have you been?
Don't talk.
Just eat.
Come here!
"Sometimes I feel"
"I've got to"
"Run away"
"I've got to"
"Get away"
"From the pain you drive into
the heart of me"
"The love we share"
"Seems to go nowhere"
"And I've lost my light"
"For I toss and turn I
can't sleep at night"
"Once I ran to you"
Want to look at yourself?
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah.
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah.
Look at yourself.
Look.
Very good Deirdre.
There are many kinds of love.
It's supposed to hurt Phillip.
One of the first laws of nature.
For every one hundred
we go after there are...
a thousand goun noticed.
For every ten we arrest five
are just going to beat...
the charges and walk away as
if nothing really matters.
How long did you have to sit
on the paedophilering...
before the other agencies
were ready to roll?
Eighteen months.
This job is not about triumph.
It's about containment.
When the pot boils
we put the lidon it.
Don't let your ego
define what success is.
It'll break your heart.
You're back.
Hey mate.
Is there some special
way of keeping time...
on your planet, Nigel?
Well, what can I say?
Traffic's a bitch.
Sir.
Okay, Nig.
Let's find a winner.
"Tainted love"
"Tainted love"
"Tainted love"
"Tainted love"
"Tainted love"
"Tainted love"
"Tainted love"
Here's one that'll make you smile.
Fluffies and Plushies.
Man, these guys must have been
dropped on their heads as babies.
I don't know, man.
My girlfriend's got one
of those pajama covers...
with like a polar bear on it and I
swear it winked at me last night.
You are sick.
We've talked about that, dude.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I've got a big one.
Send it over.
Oh mate, no.
This is really fucking I ike...
big one.
F.A.S.
Some of these pics go way
beyond fat admiration.
I mean what are
these guys doing?
They're fattening them up.
They're called feeders.
What, they feed'em because
they like fatchicks?
- Yeah.
- Fat bottomed girls?
Make the rockir world go round.
They want to control them.
Get'em as fat as they can so they...
can't even leave the house.
Can't even take a shit
without the feeder.
It's the ultimate
in sub/dom relationships.
So who's the master?
The feeder.
But if the feeder has to look
after the one being fed...
The gainer.
Doesrt that make
the feeder the slave?
It's not your run of the
mill, lick my boots...
drink my piss kind
of relationship.
It's about dependency...
The gainer relinquis hes
complete control to the feeder.
They're jumping off, Nig.
Go get'em go boy.
Gotcha!
Clever.
Okay, come on Baby.
Smile for the camera.
Show your fans how hot you are.
Okay.
Today is such a special day.
I finally surpassed my goal.
Six hundred and two pounds.
It's like...
I've done it.
We've done it.
I just feel like a huge weight's
been lifted off my shoulders.

He's got it well protected.
It's a virtual private network.
Can you go for the IP?
I'm going to see what
damage I can do in here?
Sure.
Yeah. Got his IP.
Not going to do us any good.
This guy's smart.

Must be an Asian operated s ite.
Yeah, some Chinese mama...

She doesn't even know she's

It's hardly won'th
going after him then.
He's gone to a lot of
trouble to hide something.
Consumption is evolution.
If you are what you eat, what
are you when you're eaten?
I rest my case.

unleashing hell upon your soul"

I'll take you down"
"Yeah, I'll take you down,

I'm so hungry.
Feed me.
Feed me.
I'm so weak.
Feed me.
Same guy.
Well aren't you just the Pacman.
Gobbling up all the naughty guys.
Bring me my Salisbury
steak dinner, Michael.
- Yes, mother.
- Michael.
You already...
Michael, feed me.
- I'm hungry.
- I know you're hungry.
Coming Mother.
Feed me.
Gobble, gobble,
gobble, gobble gobble.
Feed me.
Yeah, okay. Deirdre?
How cute.
What?
Oh no. That's sick.
What's this?
Blood pressure. Cholesterol.
Toledo, Ohio.
Odds?
What?
What is this?
Come on.
Shit!
You're good.
This guy's got biodata on these women.
Blood pressure and
cholesterol, heart rates.
Yeah. So he's playing
doctors and nurses.
He's force feeding them.
Someone like this just
doesn't pull the pin...
at the last minute.
That's how he gets his kicks.
He's leading them will ingly
to their slaughter.
Filming the process.
That's the same as snuff.
Fake blood,
fake gore fake deaths.
It's the same only
more sophisticated.
Only victims here are
the ones paying 39,
49 bucks a month jerking off to it.
Laughing all the way to a Swiss bank.
Drink that.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Just juice mate.
It ain't going to kill you.
Very funny Nigel.
I'm serious.
This one's for real.
He's going to extraordinary
lengths to protect it.
It took me twelve hours just
to get into the secure part...
and I still can't get i nto
the administration files.
Okay, wel I if he's really
kill ing these fat chicks...
large women...
then, I mean...
that'd make him a serial killer.
Yes.
I just don't think he's going
to put some streaming video...
of himself with the victims
in the public domain.
Sounds a bit far fetched.
Maybe that's what he
wants people to think.
Okay, if it's a softcore
or membership site...
why would he set up a VPN?
Why would he put up so
many different layers?
It could be he abducted these women.
It could be he's holding
them against their will.
It could be that what this is all
really about is your need...
to prove yourself all over again.
You think your hunch
is a good enough
for me to stick my neck out
and send you to Toledo?
If half of what you're
talking about is real...
then legally speaking,
we're in the middle...
of a great grey fucking hole.
Is it a crime to feed someone?
It's a crime to starve someone.
That doesn't make
the converse true.
We were flat out in Germany
getting a conviction...
against some psycho feeding
parts of a man back to himself.
I need your support.
Are you with me or against me?
Is hould have sent you
home when I found you...
crying in the toilets.
You need to clear your head.
You're off duty for
the rest of the month.
How many women are going to die
before you're willing to...
pull your finger out of your ass?
Don't talk to me like that Phillip.
If these women are as
fat as you say they are,
they're going to die of a
stroke or a heart attack...
or down right fucking
ugliness anyway.
Now go home!
"She floats like a swan"
"Grace on the water"

Lips like sugar"

Oh my God!
I'm sorry Baby.
I love you.
I love you Baby.
Baby?
Shut up! Just shut the fuck up!
C'mon, Baby.

"Just walk away, but slowly"
"The less you say"
You'll be more comfortable here.
You'll have the birds.
The country air.
Baby.
What Princess?
I don't like it here.
This is a very special
place to me Deirdre.
I brought your special curtains.
It smells.
And I brought you
a special treat.
Look, they're piggies.
- I was going to...
- No.
Michael, no.
I'm - not - hungry!
I don't want to be here.
Maybe I need to find a
girl who appreciates...
the world being
dropped at her feet.
I'm eating, Honey.
There's an interesting
kink for you.
A chick who logs on to
Feeder X every day.
Kath leen Metszencalmpf.
Mon tague Drive.
Got a lead, Nig.
Look at this.
Feeder X administrator
logs on from Ohio.
You are so beautiful Deirdre.
Say it again.
You are so beautiful.
We've got another great
day in Glass City.
We've got 49 outside and
we're looking for a high of 55.
Now don't forget to join Michael...
for the all you can eat buffet...
this Tuesday from
3 to 8pm at the tavern.
Mrs. Metszencalmpf?
For Michael.
This is the only compass
you will ever need.
First Church of God.
Michael.
Look, do me a favor.
Run a check on a Father Turner.
T-U-R-N-E-R.
5 Clarence Way, Toledo.
And also see what you can
find out on Michael Metszencalmpf.
Metszencalmpf.
Yeah.
The same as Kathleen.
Okay.
Phil.
Yeah what?
Every time I do a search
my codes get logged.
The shit's really going to hit
the fan when Richard finds out.
What is the worst he can do?
Fire me.
Send me to prison.
Make jail bait out of me.
You're way too old to be jail bait.
Father Turner.
Phillip Jackson.
Sorry to disturb you at home.
I went by your church
and the old lady...
Janet, she gave me your address.
- Uh huh.
- Yeah, um...
Look, I found this prayer book.
I was wondering if you could
have a look at it for me.
I'm sorry, this means nothing to me.
You barely glanced at it.
- You're not from around here?
- No.
Look is there anything you
can tell me about this?
We must have handed out thousands
of those in any one year.
The conversion rate for
saving souls is pretty low.
The bigger the volume of
bibles the better the odds.
Are you a betting man?
Because I'm betting you didn't
personally i ns cribe all of them.
What makes you think I
inscribed any of them?
We can play this game all day.
Many years ago I gave that
book to a troubled boy.
He had family problems.
When his mother passed
away he came to live with us.
That was my mistake.
I don't know where he is.
I haven't spoken to Michael for years.
I'm sorry I really don't know.
I really need to get in touch with him.
We don't speak about
Michael any more.
God can do his own dirty work.
Jackson.
Oh how are you doing mate?
My body is so out of whack I
don't know what time zone I'm in.
Mate I found some stuff
on Michael Metszencalmpf.
Your priest guy adopted him
when he was fifteen years old...
which would make him in
his late twen ties right now.
You need special authorization to
get into the adoption files.
I'll keep seeing what I can do.
The thing is...
I found some stuff on his birth mother,
Kathleen Metszencalmpf.
She died in 1984.
He was nine years old.
So we're missing about
six years of his life.
Yeah, give or take.
Why didn't the priest
adopt him when he was nine,
if that's when his mother died?
F oster care, boarding school.
Well, he's not going to
be Metszencalmpf now, is he?
I don't know mate.
We've taken this as far as we can.
You gotta come home Phil.
You've got no authority.
You've got no backup.
Didrt you hear what I said, mate?
Yeah, I'll get back to you.
Excuse me. Hi.
Sorry, I always find
the beautiful girls...
come out first thing
in the morning.
Just like the flowers.
Are you teasing me?
No, I'm not teasing you.
You don't sound like
you're from around here.
No, I'm from Sydney, Australia.
Is that near Japan?
Close enough.
What brings you to
The United States?
You wouldn't believe
me if told you anyway.
Go on then, I won't laugh at you.
Well, I met this girl
on the internet...
in a chat room.
I've heard of things like that.
Then she sent me
through her picture...
and she was beautiful.
She was five two,
308 pounds and that was it.
I knew she was the girl for me.
The only thing is when I got
to her place she was rt there.
See, a fourteen year-old
boy having some fun...
pretending to be
something that he isn't.
I'm a big girl.
I've been getting stared at
and sneered at my whole life.
I wasrt always this big.
I used to be height-weight
proportionate...
but my brother saw my potential.
He has immaculate taste.
He lives out in Sylvania,
but he's got another house
on the outskirts of town.
After he fixes it up
I'm gonna live there.
That's amazing.
I don't suppose he needs
a carpenter, does he?
Maybe he does need some help.
I don't have his phone number
but I know the address of the house.
3 Middlesex Drive.
What's his name?
Can'ter.
Michael Can'ter.
What's your name?
Nigel.
You like Burger King?
But I know where the house is.
3 Middlesex Drive.
I knew it.
Asthma.
What am I doing?
You have reached the
Michael Can'ter household.
No one is here to take
your call right now...
so if you leave your name,
your number...
and a brief and succinct message,
someone will get back to
you as soon as possible.
Peace be with you.
Yes.
Hey, wait!
Wait a minute!
This is my wife, Mary.
Beautiful isn't she?
It's okay sweetheart.
There's no reason to be scared.
I know this man.
Mr. Jackson is a
police detective.
Well, he is where he comes
from but here he's just...
a civilian trespassing
on private property.
- Should I call 911?
- What do you think, Phillip?
Do we need to call
the police or...
would you rather see a therapist?
Does she know what you're up to?
Come on.
I'll walk you inside.
I'll be right in.
I know about you.
Okay, you got me.
Put the cuffs on now, Your Honor.
I gave my women to o many
calories and made them fat.
Come to think of it
they were always fat.
But I happen to love
that about them.
You feed them to death.
Okay.
Why not, Pacman?
You've come such a long way.
I like to think of myself as
a facilitator, an enabler.
I enable my women to be free
of the social pressure...
to conform to a body norm
which is based on abstract.
Base metabolic rates
and body mass indices.
I let them be
whatever they want and...
I love them just
the way they are.
That's why you force feed
them and measure their vital signs.
Don't men measure their
chests and keep track...
of how much they can bench press?
Don't we go fishing and weigh
the fish to see how big they are?
You ever heard a woman
talking about...
fitting into a tiny
dress and you feel...
the excitement in her voice?
Statistics are just numbers.
It's the way we think about
them that gives them meaning.
Where's Lucy?
Lucy's a model and
she's a free agent.
Lucy's gone on to bigger
and better things.
It's a felony to hack Interpol, Michael.
You were hacking into
my world, Pacman.
I was just playing the game.
It was like you knocked on my door...
and said 'come out and play'.
I couldn't resist the
temptation, come on.
It's not a fucking game.
- You're a sociopath.
- A sociopath, wow!
Do you even know
what a sociopath is?
A personal ity disorder
characterised by anti-social...
impulsive behaviours.
A disregard for the law...
societal standards
and the rights of others.
How many symptoms
apply to you Phillip?
Did you just break into my house?
Deceiptful ness is indicated
by repeated lying...
use of aliases.
What did you just tell my
little sister your name was?
Reckless disregard for
the safety of oneself and others.
So?
Who's the sociopath here?
Now get off my property
before I call the police.
Call the police.
Is everything okay?
Sure it is.
Did he hurt you?
No.
I have to go out for a while.
Okay.
911 connect.
What is your emergency?
Supper at seven.
I will be here.
Deirdre!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
The last tenant moved out
because of racoons in the roof.
No one wants
unwelcome visitors.
Your tenants.
Where is Deirdre?
Has she gone onto bigger
and better things as well?
Where do you take
them, Michael,
when you do what you do?
Don't you have any one
who loves you back home?
Isn't there someone who just
wants you back safely in one piece?
Threatening me?
You don't intimidate me.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, here comes the cavalry.
I suggest you leave before
you embarrass yourself.
Charming.
Fuck you!
Oh, you've got to
be fucking kidding.
You need a good breakfast.
I need coffee.
Piping hot.
Gotta eat.
What the fuck do you want?
I don't think you fully
comprehend...
what I'm doing here.
I have a deep
appreciation for beauty.
True beauty isn't
about anorexic women...
who would crack their pelvises...
if they were to try to
give birth to a baby.
Fashion, culture...
and Mad is on Avenue have
usurped true beauty.
Models are skinny and androgenous
women with small breasts.
They're more like boys.
They have no curves.
No hips.
Small bony butts
and nobody hair.
Fashion has reduced their
physical feminity to
something defined by clothes
and hair... rather than the
body itself.
The women I nurture are free
of the artificial pursuit of vanity.
They no longer have to go
under the surgeors knife
and have their breasts reduced
or their bellies tucked.
I liberate them.
I endorse their desire
for gratification.
I allow them to be beautiful.
The truthis that men like
their women big and soft,
not constipated and
waifish with halitos is...
from malnourishment.
And you think that justifies
making them sobig...
they can't even move?
Nourishing a woman.
Honoring her.
Caring for her.
Accepting her the way she is.
That is what it means
to love a woman.
Don't you see, Phil?
It's about respecting my queen...
and putting her needs
before anything else.
The price is offset...
by the perfection.
What have you given me?
They eat to please.
I'll kill you.
Really?
Why don't we talk about
the woman in your life Phillip?
How do you make her special?
Do you treat her nice?
Do you buy her little gifts?
How do you handle being
away from home all the time?
I mean one minute
you're in Hamburg...
the next you're in Ohio?
Do you send flowers?
Do you ring your special
woman everynight...
or is there more than one woman?
Are you gentle with her?
Oh, hey Phil, are you romantic?
Or are you more the
fucking around...
slap you in the mouth type?
Fuck you!
Perhaps you're the jealous type.
Abbey!
Do you fret every time
she leaves the house?
Are you afraid
that she won't...
come back to you?
Do you push her away because
the intimacys cares you?
Oh Phil.
It terrifies you.
It's written all
over your face.
Hey!
Consumption is evolution.
Something is always
eating something else
and the best eaters, the ones
at the top of the food chain,
are the most highly evolved.
There are over six billion
people on this Earth, Phil...
and we are literally
eating her alive.
We consume because we are
programmed to consume.
Why do you think people...
are getting fatter, Phil?
Because those who
consume survive...
and those who
don't, get eaten.
These days we even
consume our dead.
We cremate them.
We compress their
ashes into Diamonds...
and we wear them as rings.
Eat your brussel sprouts.
- Honey.
- Don't look at her.
She's just a stupid cow.
Phillip.
Phillip!
Phillip!
Oh Jesus!
You're tickling me.
You love it.
You love it.
You're probably hard.
I'll eat.
Those who don't...
get eaten.
His 2 fat.
Gambling.
What is this?
I love you Baby.
You're my jelly baby.
Jesus.
Oh my god, they're
betting on one.
You're my jelly baby.
No, you're my jelly baby.
You sick fuck!
You're my jelly baby.
No, you're my jelly baby.
You're my jelly baby.
Fuck!
I'm scared.
It's okay.
I'm going to
do a little test first.
Then it's safe to
introduce some liquid.
But what if I puke?
You'll just have to
suppress your gag reflex.
I'll be very gentle.
And the Lord took bread
and broke it.
Gave it to his disciples.
He said "this is my body".
And then he took the wine.
You know, it might be a teensy
uncomfortable at first.
Okay.
Body of Christ.
Body of Christ.
If I wanted to hurt you I
wouldn't do it in a church.
What do you want?
Do you know about your
husband's website?
Of course I know.
Michael has his life.
He cares for stricken women.
It's his gift.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Don't you dare use those
words in the house of Our Lord.
Body of Christ.
Amen.
- Body of Christ.
- I'm not hungry, Father.
Okay.
The Lord looks down and weeps
when he sees people like you.
You're coming with me.
Sorry Baby.
Must have gone
down the wrong way.
I need you to look at this.
I have no desire to be
part of this insanity.
What part of this
don't you understand?
Leave me alone.
Let me go.
- Stay there.
- Let me go.
- Look at it!
- Leave me alone.
Let me go.
Look at it.
See?
Come on.
Yes, see?
See!
Michael doesn't
make money from people...
who want to look at fat women.
They're betting on when
they're going to die.
More women are going to
die if you don't help me.
- Pacman.
- Why not, Pacman?
Pacman.
Yes.
Pacman.
Hello.
Nig, yeah it's Phil.
Look I'm sending
you a list of names...
and social security numbers.
They're all gainers.
See what you can find out.
Onto it.
I wasum, I was
just about to call you.
I just found some stuff on
that Michael Metszencalmpf.
I'll upload it
to you right now.
Having a look.
You need to look at this.
Look at it.
Huh?
There's your Michael.
Sweet Jesus.
Michael!
Look, initial information
coming back, mate.
Um.
Nearly all those gainers
have been listed over...
the last three months are now
listed as missing persons.
Yeah.
Did the address
come back on Deirdre?
That's probably not
even her real name.
I'll keep searching.
Alright, you just
got to be careful, okay?
Yeah, look, okay.
Do me one more favor, okay?
I need you to do a property
search on a Michael Can'ter.
C-A-R-T-E-R.
And a...
Mary Can'ter too.
Do a property check and see
if he's got any properties...
Mate... mate I can't Phil.
This is getting
way too dangerous.
You have to come backnow.
We have enough evidence to
convince Richard...
how to do this properly.
No, I'm not letting this get cold.
I've got him.
Mate, you have no authority.
Fuck the authority!
Mate you know what could happen
if something goes wrong.
Fuck you too, Nig.
Fucking ass hole.
Here.
God forgives people who make
mistakes but I'm pretty sure...
He doesn't forgive people
who stand by while...
His most important
commandment gets broken.
The thing is, Mary.
All these women...
All these women used
to be on the website.
They're listed as missing.
That does rt mean
they're dead.
They could be anywhere.
They could have moved house.
Believe me when I tell you
when someone who goes missing...
in a western country for
more than two months...
they're not missing.
They're dead.
They don't come back.
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.
Do you know where that room is?
It could be one of the rooms
in Michael's mother's house.
Oh come on.
I've been to his mother's house.
It's abandoned and run down.
No one lives there.
Start telling me
the fucking truth.
It's Michael's mother's
farm house, you fucker!
I know who you
really work for.
He's got two houses.
Where is it?
Past the old airport highway.
It doesn't matter.
You won't catch him because
he is a child of God.
Whatever. Come on!
Come on, don't you want to
see your husband?
If you obey my commands you
will remain in my love...
Stay there and shut up!
" It was an itsy bitsy teeny
weeny yellow polka dot bikini, "
" That she wore for
the first time today, "
" An itsy teeny weeny
yellow polka dot bikini, "
... as we forgive those
who trespass against us...
Shut up!
and lead us not in to temptation,
deliver us from evil...
Shut up!
" Two, three, four, tell
the people what she wore."
" It was an itsy bitsy teeny
weeny yellow polka dot bikini, "
" That she wore
for the first time today, "
" An itsy teeny weeny
yellow polka dot bikini, "
" So in the locker
she wanted to stay "
Ow!
Ow, that hurts.
Get off me.
What did you do that for?
I'm going to come out
in a big bruise now.
Damnnear took a bite out of me.
I don't know what's got into you.
Our father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come...
I want you to beg for it.
I'm hungry.
Give me something to eat.
Give us this day
our daily bread...
Shut up!
And lead us
not in to temptation
but deliver us from evil.
Say it!
I want to be a thousand pounds.
Oh yeah?
Well say it again.
You will burn in
a lake of fire for this.
You will be punished.
Mark my words.
You will burn.
You will.
Feed me.
Holy Mary mother of God.
Michael!
Shut up!
I need to eat.
Get in.
I'm very weak.
Okay?
Here it comes.
It's a little salty, Baby.
I think it might be
a little too salty.
Fuck.
What did you put in it?
Just bulking agent.
It's giving me palpitations.
Well, I'll add some
sweetener next time, okay?
I really don't
feel well, Baby.
Maybe you should get a doctor.
Well your blood pressure is 240...
over 160 and your
temperature is fine.
But I'm having trouble breathing.
More than usual.
Okay, well...
Let's get you breathing properly.
Here we go.
Let's get you
comfortable here, darling.
Let's get you
breathing properly here.
Here we go.
Okay.
Move away from her!
Slowly.
Put your hands where
I can see them.
Hands!
You leave my Baby alone!
Don't you dare hurt him!
You don't understand.
He's killing you.
Do I look dead to you, Pussy B oy?
Shit!
Stay there!
Don't go anywhere!
Where the fuck do you
suppose I'm going to go?
That's dad.
He has rt moved for twenty years.
You don't go in there.
I'd like to introduce you to Lucy.
You're wearing her.
Is that Lucy?
Is that Lucy?
There are many cultures who
believe in reincarnation...
that upon death we move
from body to body.
I'm just speeding it up.
I have the worst heart
burn and I feel dizzy.
I really need a doctor.
Why don't you tell her, Michael?
Tell her what you've
been feeding her.
Tell her how you're
going to kill her.
Did he tell you about his wife?
His thin, beautiful wife?
Feed her.
Mary's here, Michael.
She's tied up in the back of my car.
"Mary's here, Michael."
"She's tied up in the back of my car."
Do you think I'm stupid?
- You think I'm stupid?
- Honey?
You never told me you had a wife.
I'm not hungry, Baby.
Hold the funnel.
Now.
Feed her.
No.
So petulant.
There you go.
That's it. Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Feel the love, man.
Yeah.
Feel the love.
Oh yeah.
Stop it!
Can't you see he's upset?
Michael?
It's okay, Baby.
Come sit by me.
Come to Mommy.
Yeah, Michael.
You remember Mommy.
Michael.
Come to Mommy.
Don't you talk about my mother.
You killed your own mother.
He's lying, Baby.
Say it's not true.
It's true alright.
No. No.
Yeah.
I killed her.
I did.
I even carved all the
fat off her body...
and made her thin and beautiful.
That's right.
"If all the ho ney in the world
came from this little spout...
"my brave little man
could lick it all out."
Is that how you
want me to react?
You want me to have
some kind of psychotic episode?
I can do that for you, Phil.
You'll be sorry.
"You'll be sorry because
if I die in my sleep..."
"and you're not there
to save me my hands..."
"will stick up out of my grave..."
"and people will
walk all over them."
Michael.
Can't you see this is just
a power trip for him?
Hey ass hole!
This is all your fault.
Hear that, ass hole?
- All your fault!
- Michael!
Oh Michael, you're scaring me.
Please...
put the gun away and come sit...
by me, please Baby.
Michael?
You want to see power, Phil?
This is power.
Boom!
I'm so sorry!
You, you! You!
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm so sorry.
I was just kidding around.
Just kidding around.
I'm sorry.
You! Phil! Phil!
You sit there, Phil!
Let me make you more comfortable.
Okay?
Let me make you
more comfortable.
This is power.
Stop!
Modern anthropologic thought...
suggests that the
Sabre-toothed Tiger ate...
our species into consciousness.
Isn't that cool?
And this is true power.
See what you made me do, Phil?
I'm sorry, Baby.
- This is all my fault.
- Yeah it's okay, it's alright.
Leave him alone!
You mother fucker.
This is none of your business.
Are you going to shoot me, Pacman?
After all...
Is hot you.
You'll be famous.
Your image streaming, live...
all over the world.
You may want to think
about slimming down...
a bit though.
The camera just seems to
stack on those pounds.
Bullshit!
It's not live.
Pre-recorded and edited.
You wouldn't show your
self live on the web.
It's too dangerous.
How long has Lucy been dead?
How long has Lucy been dead?
You're fucking scum.
You deserve to die.
Maybe.
But you don't have it in you.
You bastard!
You slimy fucking...
bastard!
That was what, what you were
expecting wasrt it Phil?
A hero's welcome?
Because that's you, isn't it Phil?
The big hero.
The trained soldier.
I mean take a look at yourself.
You're not a soldier.
You're a bad joke.
Fucking pervert!
Don't you see, Phillip?
It's the ridiculous animals
like you who no sooner have...
they begun fondling
their own genitalia
begin to question their man hood.
Then, with all their inferiorities and...
inadequacies, proceed to ruinit...
for the rest of us...
in their gallant fight...
...for truth...
...justice and the American way.
That is what you came
here for wasrt it Phil?
Truth and justice?
Or was it just to save the poor...
poor fat woman...
and get another notch in your belt?
Either way, fuck you, Phil.
And fuck you...
bloody fucking pig!
Get the fuck out
of our house, you pig!
Feed me.
No.
"Cherishis the word I use to describe"
- Hey.
- Hi, Honey. How are you doing?
I'm good.
I've got to go out for
a little while today.
Okay.
Well I packed some
sandwiches to tide you over.
Supper's at seven.
" You don't know how many
times I wish that I had told you "
I'll be there.
- Love you.
- Love you too.
Honey, be careful on the roads.
It's murder out there.
" You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could "
" Mold you in to
someone who could "
" Cherish me as
I cherish you "
I'm sorry.
You want some?
Say it.
Feed me.
I can't hear you.
Say it!
Feed me.
