Here.
Grrugggh!
Rrreghhh!
Ha ha ha ha!
There you go.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Go to this house.
Let's go
on the next block.
What about
this house?
[ring ring]
[ring]
[ring]
[ring]
Major bummer.
Told you--
they never do.
Shut up.
[ring ring]
[ring]
I hate to bother you,
Dr. Rainer,
But we have
a situation.
Right.
Sheriff Rivers--
Mitch--
Says to say that
you owe him one.
Heat's a killer,
huh, doc?
My grandmother,
she, uh...
Hated indian summer.
Her tribe believed
That a man's shadow
would come alive
And wrestle
with his soul.
She used to say
that, uh...
No one was safe
until the first snow.
Pretty weird, huh?
Mitch finally
made sheriff, huh?
Yup.
[camera snapping
photographs]
Hot enough
for you, Jake?
[snap]
I want you to look
at something.
Meet the Wardens.
Fred Warden--
President, Warden
properties group.
500 thou a year.
Darla Warden.
Bought things
for a living.
Many,
many things.
Somebody had quite
a ball in here.
So?
I'm not interested.
Not yet, you're not.
They have an 18-year-old
daughter Sylvie,
Or
had.
No sign of her yet.
[wailing]
And a 9-year-old son
by the name of Tim.
He's why you're here.
Atta boy.
Just relax there, Tim.
No one's going
to hurt you.
Just give me
that knife.
I just want you
to give me the knife.
All right, Tim?
[screeching]
That's not
going to work.
He's autistic.
Mm-hmm.
I'm retired.
Quit, you mean.
Get the restraint,
phil.
I know,
but he's armed.
Hey.
Hey!
Hey.
All right.
Hey, Tim.
You are the next
contestant
On
i want that knife.
Now let's just see
If you understand
the rules, o.K.?
Tattoo, you want
to tell him the rules?
[imitating tattoo]
da rules, boss?
What rules?
Tattoo,
remember the rack.
Oh, yes.
Yes, the rules.
It's too late
for the rules.
It's time to introduce
our new challenger.
Tell us something
about yourself, Bruce.
Well, I love
underwater ballet
And I love voguing
and tennis
And old
Ethel Merman records.
I love
my rottweiler rodney
And I love the movie
Spartacus.
Bruce, would you
like to meet tim?
Tim,
Bruce.
Bruce, Tim.
Ho!
That's a helluva
knife you got there.
We got a drawerful
of playing cards
Go get
some cards.
Go get
some cards.
Would you like
to start playing
Tim, you go first.
O.K., ladies
and gentlemen,
The fabulous...
The wonderful...
The beautiful...
Tim.
All right.
He's a little shy.
Let's give him
a round of applause.
Come on.
There you go.
There you go.
O.K.
Do we have
an attitude problem?
Come here.
Gag me with a spoon.
Let's go.
Jake.
Yo.
O.K.
Now this is the story
of this queen...
And...
These four jacks.
Now, she would
hide her jacks...
All throughout
the kingdom.
Then the king
went away...
Campaigning,
Pillaging,
Plundering.
And then the queen
would call her jacks
Up to her bedchamber.
Now...
You give me
that knife,
And I'll give you...
This deck of cards.
That's all you
got to do to win.
It's o.K., kid.
You're safe now.
Timmy. Tim.
Timmy.
Oh, Timmy.
Oh, Timmy.
Tim, baby,
look what I got.
He likes the spinning.
Thank you.
I'd been at the mall.
When I got back,
Tim was standing
In front
of my parents' door.
The way
he was rocking,
I should've known
something was wrong.
I ran in.
There was blood
everywhere.
He just kept
stabbing them.
Who, Sylvie?
I don't know.
He was turned
away from me
Leaning over the bed.
I didn't think.
I just jumped
on his back.
I remember the knife
coming out of his hands,
The way it fell--
So slow.
And then he slammed me
against the wall.
That's all I remember.
Did you see his face?
No.
Did you recognize him?
Do you have any idea
who he was?
I got a dress.
Beg your pardon?
At the mall.
I got a new dress.
It's the maid's
day off.
Gardener's in town
buying plants.
Coroner says
it's not the boy.
He's too short,
too weak.
Angle of the blade's
all wrong.
Besides, he's doing
one helluva imitation
Of a garden salad
inside right now.
I wouldn't give up
my day job.
Yeah.
[laughs]
Maybe it was
his sister.
She whacks herself
on the head,
Drags herself
in the closet,
Passes out
from loss of blood.
I sa rain man,  Jake.
That little boy has got
a picture of the guy
All locked up
in his little brain.
I have an eyewitness.
The only problem is
he's not talking.
Got any 3s?
[sigh]
Go fish.
Any 6s?
Hmm. I wouldn't count 
too much on that kid.
It's not the kid
i'm counting on, Jake.
O.K.
I'll take
a look at him,
But you call in
Harlinger.
Hi.
Hmm.
Well, come on, kid.
You're hurting
my feelings.
What are you
seeing in there?
[door opens]
He's clearly
catatonic--
A result
of the extreme shock.
Primitive attempts
to force or cajole him out
May lead to disaster.
Any of Dr. Rainer's
shenanigans
Will simply send him
deeper into withdrawal.
Shenanigans?
Perhaps permanently.
What shenanigans?
This should draw him out
quite effectively.
I'll be going now.
We'll find out what you have
hiding in there.
Hey!
I'll send you
the bill.
What about
the girl, Jake?
She's young.
They need help.
Rene Harlinger
knows exactly--
Oh, screw harlinger.
They need you.
So, what do you think,
counselor?
You think I should just
walk up to this kid
And say, "who hacked up
your parents?"
Hmm?
This kid doesn't speak
on a good day.
And he's just
been through a real...
A real trauma,
And the memory of it
Is going
to be buried very deep.
Push this kid too much,
he'll shatter.
All right.
You won't
take the case--
Fine, but don't bullshit
yourself, rainer.
It's not the boy
you're protecting.
What do you think--
robbery gone wrong?
Cash left
in the house.
Guy comes in,
Takes out
the parents.
Let's the boy
and girl live?
Nah. Something else.
Aw, man.
Old apache proverb--
Watched pots
never boil.
Ha ha.
Take care
of the kids?
Mother was an orphan.
Father had an uncle
in Madrid
And his sister
in Memphis.
Both were jumpy about
the boy's condition.
[telephone ringing]
I set up temporary
accommodations.
White magic.
Hmm?
Oh, god.
Those cuts are deep.
Whoever did this
was strong, bear,
Had, uh, passion.
[beep beep]
Real strong.
O.K. Got your napkins
in your lap?
There you go.
Well, go on, honey.
Eat up. It's good.
I'm glad you
got some sleep.
You look a lot better.
I want to thank you
for everything.
It's nothing.
[moaning]
It's o.K., Timmy.
Take it easy.
Oh. He doesn't eat
anything round.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can...
Make something
square.
That's o.K.
[quieting]
How come we have
to eat peas?
Today nobody
has to eat peas.
How about that?
What's wrong with him?
[sigh]
[moaning]
[screeching]
Timmy!
Timmy.
Timmy.
Shh shh.
Shh.
Shh, Tim.
Timmy.
Shh shh.
Timmy, shh.
It's o.K. Shh.
Isn't there
someplace else
You'd rather go,
Miss Warden?
No.
[loon calls]
Timmy.
Tim.
Timmy.
Tim.
So, I said to him,
"Harry,
I'm leaving you.
"I'm a desirable
woman
"in the prime
of my life.
I'll find a man
who appreciates me."
So I packed up
all my stuff
And moved
into the pool house.
I'm thinking of putting
an ad in the personals,
Maybe get my hair done.
If you were me...
Would you have sex
on the first date?
Dr. Rainer.
Hmm?
[toy piano jingling]
I want you to play
this note for me,
That's right--
That one
right there.
Yes, that's right.
Can you play
one more time for me?
Here we are, Timmy.
Timmy, look,
there's Adele.
Come and sit
by me, Timmy.
Adele, look
who's back.
See you later,
buddy.
How you doing,
honey?
You having
a good day?
There you go.
There you go.
You want to take out
your blocks?
Eeeeh.
Eeeeh.
Isn't that nice?
Pick up this
for me.
Pick it up.
Here's something
for you.
Here.
"autistic child drowns."
He ran a group home.
Martha's gone.
I'm done.
You cure her yet?
Sure. I told her
She'd be crazy
not to be crazy.
Can I charge her
for that?
He wants
to use some drug
To make tim talk.
I checked
the library.
It's got all these
side effects--
Massive
respiratory failure
And inhibition.
What the hell is--
Disinhibition.
It's like, uh...
A massive breakdown
Of someone's
psychological defenses.
But that's my point.
Don't people need
their defenses?
It could make him
psychotic.
Dr. Harlinger
knows exactly what he's doing.
I'm absolutely sure
he can administer this drug.
You worked
without drugs.
You had
a group home.
I don't work
with children anymore.
I've been
out of the field
A long time.
I'm sorry.
You know, I figured out
something about death.
It's contagious.
I know that sounds
crazy, but...
It's like when
people you love die--
You feel like you
should have died, too.
You don't want anybody
to know you survived.
No one.
He can keep the toy.
I have a patient
coming.
Jake.
Jake.
Telephone.
Hurry.
[screeching]
I can't allow visitors.
The boy must learn
that acting out--
I'm not a visitor.
I'm his doctor.
The girl agitated him
before the needle came near him.
She provides for him.
If he gets better,
she has no source--
Open the door, rene.
This is what
brought on tragedy
The last time.
You mean well, jake,
but you go too far.
Aah!
Tim.
Tim, shh. Shh.
It's o.K.
It's o.K.
It's all right.
Your sister's here.
Let me get you
out of this.
Tim, relax.
Be careful.
Tim.
There we go.
Tim, tim.
Tim.
Tim. Tim.
Tim, stop.
Tim.
Shh.
Shh shh shh.
Shh.
Shh shh.
Shh. Shh.
Shh.
Hi, Jake.
Miss warden,
hi, how are you?
So...
Couldn't just take him
when I asked you.
I'm taking it now.
O.K.
But I need some answers.
I'm hitting the wall
on physical evidence.
There's no useable
prints on the knife,
Not even
a measly tire track.
Get me murderer, Jake,
Or I'll have to use Harlinger's 
magic potion on that boy.
Come on.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Uhhh!
Welcome home,
dorothy.
This is
very high functioning.
But he doesn't show emotion
like normal people.
He hardly even
laughs or cries.
He'll never
get things for you,
Unless he knows you
really well.
He basically
does what he wants.
What about sounds?
He's a great mimic
of music and words,
But he only
copies things.
It's like it's
never really him.
Sylvie...
I don't understand
why I can't stay.
Sylvie...
What do you know
about autism?
Autism is a...
Pervasive
development disorder,
Usually from birth,
A perceptual cocoon
forms around the child,
Trapping him
in his own private world.
That's very good.
Nobody knows
what autism is.
Nobody.
2,000 years ago,
Autistics were
worshipped as gods,
And 300 years ago,
They were burned
at the stake as witches.
Now we treat them
with drugs
And therapy.
I knew
an autistic girl once
Who could create
the most unbelievable sculptures.
She couldn't button
her own shirt.
There are autistics
who can play entire sonatas
After hearing them
only once.
Nobody knows.
Nobody knows
what autism is.
O.K.?
O.K.
O.K. Now
that we don't know
I'll tell you
how it works.
Tim...
Bring me the cards.
See? He won't do it.
He doesn't know you.
Tim, honey,
bring me the cards.
Thank you.
Go play.
Go sit down.
Many autistics like cards.
They like numbers.
They like music.
Anything in sequence.
O.K., now...
Let's say that this 10
Is your memory of what 
happened that night at your house.
You have 100 different ways
of getting to that memory--
The smell of pumpkins
Or the creak
of a floorboard.
But not tim.
For tim, the only way
to get to that 10,
That memory,
Is through the 9.
The only way for him
to get to the 9
Is through the 8,
And so on,
and so on,
That's
what tim remembers.
The ace--
The beginning
of the chain--
Now...
What is tim's ace?
It could be a sound,
it could be an image,
I don't know,
but that's my job.
He doesn't like
strangers.
He hardly
notices them.
That's why
you can't stay.
Tim and I have to figure out
how to relate,
To become friends.
Now, I'm going to
give you some phenoral.
Take it twice a day.
It'll help you
with the panic...
I'm fine.
And the nightmares.
How did you know?
It's what I do.
[grunting]
Shh.
Tim.
Tim.
How you doing?
Is something wrong?
No.
I had a dress
like that once.
The  piece de
resistance.
Did you know that every
great relationship
Begins over food?
Did you know that?
[humming]
Something is missing
ah!
[spraying
whipped cream]
âª I just got up
from no sleep at all âª
âª I stared at the ceiling âª
Excuse me.
âª I talked to the wall âªâª
Great spot.
You know the owner,
Or do you have to
have reservations?
What the hell are these?
These are therapy bills.
Is this a quiz?
Why didn't you tell me Darla Warden
was your patient?
Well, because therapy
is confidential,
Even if they're dead.
I thought you knew that.
So she won't care.
It's not relevant.
It happened
over a year ago.
I saw her
a couple times.
God damn it, jake!
O.K.
She was having
an affair.
That's not relevant?
I hate to bust
your bubble, pal,
But half the women here
are having affairs.
She tell you
who the guy was?
No.
Let's just cut
the self-pity.
From now on,
what you know, I know.
You got it?
Dr. Rainer!
I'm sorry, Dr. Rainer.
It's Harry.
He says
he wants a divorce!
And I love him.
Poor harry.
Dr. Rainer!
I'll get rid of her.
I'm sorry,
dr. Rainer.
Martha, you don't have
a session today.
I need to talk.
He said he wants me
to move out.
Martha, I do have a patient
I'm seeing right now.
I never, ever expected him
to take me seriously.
He's very serious.
You should talk to him.
I just thought
I could talk to you.
You would know
what to do.
Hi. Where's tim?
He's in the barn.
I moved into
the pool house,
Timmy!
Oh, my god.
Timmy!
Oh, baby.
Baby, are you o.K.?
Are you
out of your mind?
What's going on here?
You're supposed to be
helping him, jake!
I wasn't sure
you were coming.
I took him home to change
after his class.
I do need your help.
Well, for starters,
it's not the cards.
It's the voices.
What voices?
Rail family,
- please proceed to table 11.
Manager to the floor.
Hello.
We'd like a table
for two, please.
Your name?
Mizelle.
M-i-z-e-l-l-e.
O.K. Thanks.
Uh, Sylvie...
What exactly
are we doing here?
Wait a minute, Jake.
Jones, party of three.
Please proceed
to table 9.
Table 2 needs a set-up.
Busboy to table 2, please.
Down.
Martin, party of 4,
table 10.
[imitating hostess]
Martin, party of 4,
Please proceed
to table 10.
Did you get
to any of the games?
You are all
at the wrong table.
We're just finishing
right now.
They called our name.
Table 17, you're
at the wrong table.
Table 17, you're
at the wrong table.
Please move to table 6.
We're at
the wrong table?
This is ridiculous.
Today only,
Free hard-shell crabs
for all our guests.
Yay!
- Yay!
What the hell's
going on?
Ah, who knows?
Special--free pitcher
of beer for each male.
Come on up to the bar.
Well...If we could find
some help here.
Why don't you
push off?
We'll just stay here
while you eat.
Main cashier, please report
to the manager.
Come on, Timmy,
come on.
I sometimes wonder if tim
has a voice of his own.
He's got a voice.
How come
he never uses it?
Well...
Most folks only see
the biology of autism.
They see it as a problem
of the brain wiring.
Well, what do you see?
I think autism
is a kind of great,
Of the whole world.
There's a boy in here.
He's trapped
behind a wall.
I think the fact
that he's trapped
Makes him terrified.
Take his not
fetching things.
That's just his fear of
surrendering his will.
And not using his voice.
For Tim, it's safer to be other 
people rather than himself
Because when you
use your own voice,
It's an expression of who
you truly are...inside.
You never really know
what will set him off,
Except for
this one thing--
Tv shows.
It's called echolalia.
Look! Up in the sky!
It's a bird!
It's a plane!
He'll never do it
with a stranger.
Steve Austin,
a man barely alive,
We can rebuild him.
We have
the technology.
What?
You never heard of
the six million dollar man?
No.
That's before your time.
Uh...
There's a signpost
up ahead.
Next stop,
the twilight zone.
[humming
twilight zotheme]
Space--
the final frontier.
Space--
the final frontier.
These are the voyages of
the starship Enterprise.
Ah-choo!
Can I help
with something?
It's under control.
I'll help make
the salad.
You and Jake seem to be
working well together
All of a sudden.
I don't know.
He runs so hot and cold.
I really don't
get him at all.
Could've fooled me.
Oh, god,
I'm sorry, Syl.
I know what you think,
But i'm not really
not interested in Jake.
It's just that
i feel like
He's the only one
that can help Tim.
And if he can't, they might
take him away from me.
Good to see you, Jake.
Everything o.K,?
I'm fine, Jake.
Go on.
I almost got it.
Watch out.
Try to get it now.
Try and get it.
Not one single suspect.
What about the lover?
Dead end.
Well, I don't think
two sessions
Is a lot to base
a psychological autopsy on.
Why don't you give it
a shot anyway?
O.K.
Darla Warden was
extremely well-groomed.
She was very sexy.
Yeah, I knew you guys
thought about that stuff.
She was suffering from
a chronic, low-level depression.
She didn't have
any close friends.
No extended family.
She talked a lot
about her children.
She also talked about her dependence
on her husband.
Freddie--
Owned his own company,
Secretary of the pta.
That's all I got.
Want a beer?
Darla Warden presented her 
husband as ideal.
Yeah.
Near perfect.
Nobody's that perfect,
Jake.
I'm saying she presented him
as perfect.
Yeah, so?
What does that mean?
Well, when someone
goes to therapy,
They give you a picture.
Often, that picture's
made up of the same lies
That they tell
themselves.
The real question is if Darla thought
he was perfect,
Why the affair?
What you're saying is
she didn't love him.
You love your wife?
Of course
I love my wife.
So what's upsetting her?
What?
Could it be you?
Jake, that's personal,
all right?
That's my point.
All families
have secrets.
That's the smell
of ghosts.
You'll have to tell me
what went on in here, kid.
Where's mommy?
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Show me where
your mother is.
Good.
Now...
Where's daddy?
Where's daddy?
Where's daddy?
On nick at nite, tonight at 9:00.
Tim, show me something.
Come on.
Tim, I've had enough
from you.
God damn you,
stop this rocking this instant!
Tim.
[banging]
Tim.
Tim!
Tim!
Uhh...
Uhh...
[grunting]
I'm going to tell mitch
That I regressed the kid
back to that night,
And he didn't
see anything.
You know, that he
covered his eyes.
You're quitting again,
jake.
Everything else
is just words.
Karen, listen--
Don't.
You're the one hiding
from the world, Jake,
Not tim, you.
You're overidentifying
with the problems of this child.
Don't you dare
psychoanalyze me, you bastard.
Oh, god.
God, Jake,
what happened to you?
I pushed too hard.
I pushed too hard
with Billy.
Billy's suicide
was a tragedy.
But you didn't
kill Billy.
The truth
didn't kill Billy.
I lost him.
You have to push.
I think I can.
Isn't that
what you said?
It's not that simple,
Karen, o.K.?
Go on, then.
You act like you died
with Billy in the lake.
Well, take the final step!
I'm sorry.
You have to commit, Jake.
That's all Tim needs,
All I need.
I want you
to talk to me, Tim.
What happened that night?
What did they say?
Please don't hurt me.
I'll do anything.
Oh, my god,
he's got a knife.
Please don't hurt me.
Oh, God, I'm bleeding!
Don't let me die!
Please!
Don't kill my wife.
Leave my children alone.
Tim...
Somebody must've
said something.
I'm going to cut you.
I want all your money,
or I'll kill you both.
Ow! Shit!
Karen!
Ow!
God.
Karen!
This might sting
just a little bit.
Here we go.
Just be still.
I thought I'd warm up
on the swings.
I didn't even think.
We should've had
those swings fixed.
I'm such an idiot!
I didn't even look.
Pass me the gauze.
Yes.
Oh, god damn.
[man's voice]
god damn.
[man's voice]
God damn! You fuck!
Oh, Jesus!
[woman's voice]
oh, no! Oh, my god.
Stop, please!
[woman's voice]
I'll kill you, you bastard!
I'll kill you!
[woman's voice]
oh, God, let me die now.
Sweet God,
let me die.
[younger woman's voice]
Let go! Let go!
Who is that?
That's my father.
Who's he talking to?
What's he angry about?
I don't know.
O.K.
[woman's voice]
oh, no. Oh, my god.
Stop, please!
Is that you talking?
Uh-uh.
No.
Then who?
That's my mother.
She's frightened.
Maybe she sees
someone coming in,
The man with the knife.
[woman's voice]
I'll kill you, bastard,
My mother again.
Maybe she's trying
to save my father.
Maybe she's trying
to stop him.
[woman's voice]
oh, god, let me die now.
Sweet god, let me die.
Sylvie.
My mother!
My dad was...
My dad was dead!
She wanted to die!
[younger woman's voice]
Let go! Let go!
That's me.
I think--
I guess that's when I came in,
Tried to get
the knife from him.
O.K. And
what about tim?
Was Tim in the hallway
the whole time?
Did he come
inside the room?
Did he run away?
Sylvie,
he got the knife
Stop! Please, stop!
I'm really tired.
Your father was
raging at someone.
Who was he angry at?
When did you ever
hear him behave like that?
Who was he ever
angry at?
I don't know!
[man's voice]
god damn! You fuck! Oh, jesus!
Come on, syl.
I can't do this
anymore!
[man's voice]
god damn! You fuck! Oh, jesus!
Please!
Syl, help me out here.
God damn.
[man's voice]
god damn! You fuck! Oh, jesus!
Stop, please!
Just stop!
My father wasn't raging!
He didn't rage!
Listen to his voice.
Of course he was!
What else
could he be feeling?
I think someone
killed my parents
While they were
having sex, o.K.?
What happened in there?
What happened
in there, kid?
Why didn't you get hurt?
It's just too awful
to imagine.
I had
- a criminal procedures guy
Who used to say
Put yourself
in the place of the victim--
Laying there,
touching,
Warming up
to each other,
And then...
I mean,
that can't be coincidence.
Somebody must've wanted
to find them in bed.
Must've waited.
A lover or--
You should wear orange.
Man in the woods
without orange,
Liable to
get himself shot.
What's up, doc?
You tell me.
Nothing.
Decided to come out here
And, uh...
Clear my head,
Get a little practice.
What were you thinking,
mitch?
You think I was just
going to keep quiet?
That I was going
to cover for you?
O.K., Jake.
We were on and off
for about a year.
Women in town...
They see a cop,
man in charge,
They want to be
rescued something.
Over the years,
i've done my share
Usually once or twice,
That's it, you move on.
But Darla was different.
She was something else.
Good is not the word,
Jake.
It just got
out of control.
In fact, we were together
that same day.
Later on, the call
came into the station.
I drove out
to the house, and I...
I didn't kill her,
Jake.
I was
sleeping with her.
O.K.
And what else?
What do you mean?
What else
are you hiding?
I'm not hiding
anything else.
I've been thoroughly
professional.
No, this is not
just professional.
This is personal.
This is murder.
You know more about her
than anybody else.
You heard her say things
nobody else heard her say.
You know things.
That's where your answers
are going to be.
Jesus, chief,
you scared me.
I thought everyone
was gone for the night.
I'm looking
at the effects again,
In case forensics
missed anything.
Need some help?
Nah.
Go home.
Get some sleep.
They'll still
be dead tomorrow.
Alrighty.
This one
is your sister.
This one's your mom.
This one's your dad.
It's late.
I made up the spare.
Want to play some more
tomorrow?
Timmy, please stop it.
[laughs]
What's this?
Mmm, that's Alvin.
When--when there were
children around here,
I used to train
the staff with them.
People will tell
a stuffed animal
A hell of a lot more
than another human being.
Sit down.
Talk to him.
No. Uh-uh.
Why not?
It's good therapy.
Come on.
He's only a bear.
Hi, alvin.
I'm Sylvie.
This is too hard.
You know
your friend Jake?
Well, I can see
he's in pain
And that he wants
to help us.
Alvin knows
all about me.
I want to help him, too,
But I feel like
we're the same.
The only way we're o.K. Is
taking care of someone.
I want to take care
of him.
I want to help him.
No.
No.
No.
[telephone rings]
[ring]
I better
have won something.
Jake, this is mitch.
I need you down
at the hospital
All right. Calm down.
Relax.
What's going on?
I'll tell you
when you get here.
And bring the boy.
I'll be right down.
Bring tim.
Yeah, i'll bring him.
[dial tone]
I love you, too.

Sheriff.
Doctor.
That was a slight.
We're supposed
to be hurt.
[harlinger]
sit down, young man.
Tell him to sit.
He doesn't follow
commands, rene.
Right over here, Tim.
Many autistics have
unique and fascinating abilities.
I'd like
to demonstrate one
Which I think you'll
find revelational.
Revelational?
I don't think
that's a word.
You said no drugs,
doctor.
Oh, come on.
You know autistics
like this can't be hypnotized
Into remembering anything.
The most you can
hope for sometimes
Is changing their mood.
Will you hypnotize him
into being happy?
Not precisely.
As we know, a key issue
absolving the boy
Was insufficient
strength.
I won't allow this.
I spoke to the judge.
Don't do this!
I don't believe
you're in charge here.
Autistics can show
remarkable--
Jake!
I need to see this.
Now, i'm going to count backwards
from five, tim.
When I get to zero,
You will be
perfectly asleep.
You understand?
5...
4...
3...
2...
1...
0.
Can you hear me, Tim?
Can you open your eyes?
Sheriff, will you
check the door
And confirm that
it's securely locked?
Tim, the lights
are going very dim.
It's getting
very dark in here.
Wouldn't it be nice
to get out of here,
Out into the light?
It's so dark
in here.
It's getting
darker, Tim.
The light
is almost gone.
You've got to get
out of here, Tim.
The darkness
is closing in.
Hurry,
there's no time.
The light
is almost gone.
[click]
Get out now.
Aah!
[crying]
Aah!
Aah!
[moans]
Stop.
I'll snap my fingers.
You'll awake.
I'm really impressed,
rene.
Really impressed.
You deserve
- the marquis de sade award.
We know
the boy's strong enough.
O.K.,
i'll give it to you.
Under certain
extreme circumstances,
Autistics
can demonstrate...
Can I remind you
that Houdini over here
Had to hypnotize him
into hysterics
In order to get him
to do it?
The boy had no motive
at all to kill his parents.
We found semen stains
on the sheets.
So what?
So the warden's
had an active sex life.
As a matter of fact,
I think the Wardens
were about to get into it
When the killer
showed up.
I said semen,
only semen.
There was no sign
of the wife in the bed,
And...
We found these.
I found the negatives
behind the picture frame.
I think that's motive enough
for the boy, don't you?
It seems Fred Warden wasn't using 
his wife for recreation.
He was using his son.
You glib, cavalier
son of a bitch.
I'll need to keep the boy
here for a couple of days,
Run medication
in a controlled setting.
Rainer, you're
welcome to observe.
You might learn something.
I'm going
to arrest the boy.
What about
the angle of the blade?
I can't figure
that either,
But we'll give him
Harlinger's drug.
If he didn't do it,
we'll know.
Mitch.
Mitch!
I'm close. I can do this
safely without drugs.
Just give me the day.
Come on.
The lake's pretty well
iced up.
Maybe it'll finally snow.
There never was a man with a knife,
was there, Sylvie?
No.
Did you really think that
you could protect him?
Right here!
Touching Tim.
Making him pose.
Tim must've hidden
the knife under the bed.
My mother--
maybe she came in in the middle.
I don't know.
I tried to stop him.
I tried to get
the knife away.
Will you tell
the police?
[man's voice]
i'll kill you, bastard!
I'll kill you!
[woman's voice]
oh, god, let me die now!
Sweet god, let me die!
Well...
I guess maybe you can
plead insanity, huh?
I'm sorry, son.
I'm so sorry.
Sylvie, it's time to go.
I cooked.
A toast.
Drink to us.
We're going to need
all the luck we can get
From here on in.
And to you...
For being unpredictable.
You know
something funny?
When you were first
going to take the case,
I went
and read up on you.
Here's to me...
Girl genius.
Bonsai.
Sylvie, enough now.
I mean Harlinger...
All his medications...
Bet he would've had
tim talking in no time,
But not you.
I read about it
in the papers.
You're old-fashioned.
You're a failure.
A quitter.
To Jake.
The quitter.
That's why
I picked you, Jake.
I studied
your credentials.
You were supposed to give it 
a couple tries and give up.
That's all you had to do!
Sylvie. Sylvie!
Sylvie! Sylvie!
What will happen
to him?
No one will ever
need you as much as I do.
As we do.
Stay with me.
Sylvie, listen
to yourself.
You're not making
any sense.
I knew you'd say no.
I'm sorry, Jake.
You know that medication
you prescribed for me--
Phenoral?
Well, I read about it
In your  physician's
desk reference.
It doesn't have
any side effects
Unless it's mixed
with alcohol.
Then it causes
temporary paralysis.
For 30 minutes you're
going to be a statue.
What else can I do?
I can just tell them
You tried to seduce me.
So I ran out
on the ice...
'cause I didn't think
you'd chase me there.
You fell in.
You got to save
the people you love.

Hello.
Sylvie, Sheriff Rivers.
Hi, Sheriff,
what's up?
I, uh...
I need to talk to you.
Can I come over?
No. No. I have
to run to the store
To pick something up
for myself.
Maybe I could
come down there.
Come down here?
Um...
O.K.?
O.K.
[imitating rivers]
good-bye, Sylvie.
Bye.
[dial tone]
Tim?
Tim?
Timmy?
Tim?
Tim?
Tim?
Tim.
Tim.
Tim.
[knocking on door]
Come in.
Hi, Sheriff.
Ms. Warden,
what can I do for you?
You called. You said
it was important.
Not me, young lady.
You didn't call?
No.
Sorry, chief.
Ms. Warden.
I'm short
on the night shift.
Could you check the board?
Can you wait?
I'll be right back.
Yeah.
I'll wait.
O.K., talk to me.
[telephone rings]
[ring]
911 emergency.
911 emergency.
Please state
your business.
Emergency 911.
Surprise.
Now, drowning...
That's pretty original.
The gun...
It's going to be harder
to construct a story
About that one.
I think I'll manage.
I have no doubt
that you will,
Like you manage
everything else.
You were always
distracting me,
Leading me
to the voices,
Cutting
your hands...
King of hearts,
that's your dad.
Queen of hearts,
that's your mother.
The jack, that's tim,
And this one, the one
that's always standing,
That's you.
[man's voice]
god damn.
God damn, you fuck!
Oh, jesus.
That's the king,
your father.
Just like we thought,
And he's right here
on the bed
Touching tim.
[woman's voice]
oh, no!
Oh, my god! Stop!
Please!
That's your mom.
You can actually hear
the fear in her voice.
I don't think
she's seen the killer.
I think that she's here,
Accidentally walking in
on your father and tim.
[woman's voice]
I'll kill you, bastard!
This is where
I really blew it.
What did we say,
That this was your mother
attacking the killer--
Attacking her son,
Calling her own son
a bastard?
I don't think so.
I don't think
it's your mother's voice at all.
Is it, Syl?
I think it's a voice
just like your mother's.
I think that you burst
in here,
And you went straight
for him with that knife.
It was him
that you wanted,
Wasn't it, syl?
Her being here
was just some terrible coincidence,
But all those years of--
Of turning a blind eye,
Of her knowing
and keeping quiet,
So you stabbed her, too.
[younger woman's voice]
Let go! Let go!
Now that is you.
That's you, and you
are struggling for that knife,
But it's not you trying
to take the knife
Away from tim.
It's Tim trying to take
the knife away from you.
It wasn't just Tim,
Was it, Syl?
Tim came later.
He raped you first...
Over and over
for years.
I should've seen it.
The symptoms were right in front
of me all the time--
The obsession
with your appearance,
The exercising,
The way that you took on
the perfect role
For each of us.
You were an ingenue
for Mitch
And a daughter for Karen
And a nymphet for me.
You know...
Abuse victims
- are always the best actors.
They have to be.
They live their whole lives
with pain and shame,
Pretending that
there's nothing wrong.
It's the greatest
performance of all.
Baby, i'm so sorry.
I just couldn't let him
touch you like that anymore.
You can't know
what it's like.
You can feel it
on your skin.
You can feel it
running inside of you--
The dirt
and awfulness.
Sylvie, let me
help you.
Don't you
understand?
No one can know.
They'd put me in jail
and take him to an institution.
There'd be no one left
to protect him anymore.
[cocking gun]
Step away, Tim.
Move.
[his own voice]
Sylvie, please don't.
Come on!
If we're going to do this thing,
let's do this thing.
All right.
We're too old
for this.
How does it look
for us tomorrow?
The precedents
are pretty strong.
I have a chance
Of getting her transferred to a minimum 
security hospital,
Assuming I can get
her therapist
To show up
for the hearing.
I think that can
be arranged.
Where's the midget?
I feel ridiculous.
You look ridiculous.
[imitating Jake]
you look ridiculous.
Tim, use
your own voice.
[his own voice]
you look ridiculous.
[imitating witch]
ahh, you think so,
Ha ha ha ha!
Well, let's do some
trick-or-treating, boys.
How come he'll only
talk with you, Jake?
If I remember correctly,
change takes time.
Catchy little phrase
for every occasion.
