Nope. But it's the next best thing.

Alex, what was your wish?
I wished we could go home.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I love this.
But it's not the real thing.
That's because it's a mud model, Alex.
It's not actually New York.
I hope that was clear.
What are we doing?
Here we are relying on the penguins
to come back for us.
But... we should just go to Monte Carlo
and get them.
How do a lion, a zebra, a giraffe and a
hippo walk into a casino in Monte Carlo?
- I don't know. Ask the rabbi!
- Hey, I'm serious.
Come on! We can do it!
We can do anything! It's us!
We're us!
Yeah, that's right.
We've gone halfway around the world!
Compared with that, Monte Carlo's
just a hop, skip and a swim away!
- Yeah.
- To home.

Phase Two: We chew out the penguins

Phase Three:
We apologize to the penguins

Phase Four: Back to New York City.

Yes! Trapeze! Exactly!
Wow! Trapeze americano!
Hey, I have a great idea!
Maybe you come with us to Roma!
<font color="#D900D9">(gasps)</font>
Hey, Vitaly is just playing around.
He is good, no?
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.
But we're gonna get off at the next stop
so we can get back to America.
<font color="#D900D9">(Stefano gasps)</font>
That is such a coincidence!
Because we're going... going to...
Let me finish!
We're going to America, as well! <font color="#D900D9">(growls)</font>
- What?!
- America?
- Going to America?
- What?
<font color="#D900D9">(Stefano)</font> Sí.
- Wow? When?
After Roma, we go to London.
And then a big-time promoter will see us
and then send us to New York.
- They're going to New York!
- Well, only if he likes what he sees.
New York? Seriously?
That's our home. That's where we live.
Isn't that fun?
- Could we go with you?
- Sure! You can bunk with Vitaly!
<font color="#D900D9">(shrieking)</font>
- Whoa!
<font color="#D900D9">(Stefano)</font> Or not.
- Nyet!
<font color="#D900D9">(Stefano)</font> Oh, no.
I don't think Vitaly likes that idea.
What's he gonna do?
Which one of you is leader?
Tell your comrades
there is one rule we do not break!
Thou shalt say it and not spray it?

Alex. Like New York Knicks.
I know. New York Kniss. Is not hard.
Whoa.
What is this place?
I know you think we are
a stinky, poopy circus,
but there is something you must know.
There was a time
when Circus Zaragoza,
we were a great circus!
Numero uno in all the Europa!
And Vitaly...
he was the biggest star of us all.
He was fearless.
Taking risks. Always new.
He jump through the hoop
like he could fly!

Smaller!
Ha!
<font color="#D900D9">(pops)</font>
<font color="#D900D9">(cheering)</font>
<font color="#D900D9">(Stefano)</font> And the hoop, she got smaller!
Like the ring
on a finger of the tiniest lady
with the slimmest of fingers.
Bravo, Vitaly!
<font color="#D900D9">(Stefano)</font> He would not stop pushing.
And one fateful day...
...he push too far!
Light the hoop on fire!
<font color="#D900D9">(gasps)</font>
<font color="#D900D9">(cheering)</font>
<font color="#D900D9">(Stefano)</font> He fly too close to the sun...
and he got burned.
Literally. The extra virgin olive oil
is extra flammable.
And he lost everything.
His wife, she run off with a musician.
He lost his dignity... his fame...
...his passion... and his fur.
And when it grow back, it is less soft.
More like a prickly beard.
Scusí. Vitaly!
<font color="#D900D9">(growls)</font>
<font color="#D900D9">(shrieks)</font> Nothing!
His only passion now is the borscht.
- Whoa.
- He was our inspiration.
So when he lost his passion,
well... as Vitaly goes,
so goes the circus.
- This is why we need your help.
- What sort of help?
You can teach us to do new circus.
Americano style!
We find a new passion.
Make a new show.
And we go all the way to US and A!
<font color="#D900D9">(chair squeaking)</font>
A!
I know. It is stupido idea.
We are a lost cause.
No, no, this isn't stupido.
This could work!
- What?
- What you just said.
<font color="#D900D9">(gasps)</font> What?
- The idea you said. Two seconds ago.
- What?
- Your stupido idea!
- It could?
- Stefano, you're a genius!
No, no, no, no.
I am only average intelligence.
Some say I'm even slightly below.
We are gonna rethink everything
anybody's ever known about circus!
I call it Phase 4-7B,
wherein, in order to get home,
we will come up with something fresh,
something amazing, something brand-new!
Fresh, never before seen!
Off the chain!
Something that'll blow
that circus promoter away!
<font color="#D900D9">(angry shouting)</font>
- I missed.
- Off with your head!
- I'm gonna chew his leg off!
Circus has been same for generations!
We make good,
classic family entertainment.
Aha! But last few generations,
families... not so entertained.
<font color="#D900D9">(clears throat)</font>
That's right.
Families not so entertained
because you're just going
through the motions out there.
It's missing passion.
How one to have passion
for stool poked in face?
Exactly! And by stool
you mean chair, right?
The fact is, you guys,
you got stuck in a rut.
You stopped pushing,
you stopped taking risks.
But those days are over.
Because now we're going
to completely change the show.
Then it wouldn't be a circus, would it?
Circus is not about the acts you do.
Circus is in here.
How come Freddie
gets all the circus?
Circus is about following your passions,
wherever they take you!
<font color="#D900D9">(scoffs)</font> You cannot change circus.
There is long tradition!
That's what everybody thought, Vitaly,
until those French Canadians came along,
drunk off their maple syrup
and cheap pharmaceuticals,
and completely flipped the paradigm.
Now they play Vegas.
Fifty shows a day in 52 separate venues.
And one of them
completely in the nude.
Yeah, that's right.
And you know how they did it?
Take off their clothes?
- No. They got rid of the animals.
<font color="#D900D9">(Stefano)</font> What?
- Say it ain't so!
<font color="#D900D9">(Gia)</font> Che stupida! No animals...
- How could they?!
- Well, you know what I say to that!
I say they can take
the animals out of the circus,
but they cannot take
the animals out of the circus!
I mean, they cannot... <font color="#D900D9">(clears throat)</font>
I think you understand what I'm saying!
- Yeah!
- Yes!
Uh... No!
We don't need humans
because we've got passion.
What does a human say
when he's passionate?
He says, "I'm an animal!"
Well, we are animals!
<font color="#D900D9">(cheering)</font>
<font color="#D900D9">(roaring)</font>
We'll make an all-animal circus!
Because if we follow our passion,
we can go anywhere.
- Anywhere!
- We can do anything!
- Anything!
- If we do it together!
- All of us!
- Yeah... Yeah, yeah!
- Our circus!
- Yeah!
- We're in! We'll have some of that!
- Can I hear you say "fur power"?
Fur power!
Take our circus back,
and we'll do it together!
You and me, baby! An act together!
I love it!
We can do
that funk and groove dance thing!
- Uh, dance?
- This thing right here. Look.
<font color="#D900D9">(humming)</font> Me and you! We got this!
<font color="#D900D9">(stammering)</font> But I can't dance.
<font color="#D900D9">(chanting)</font> Fur power!
- Chanting is fun! Chanting is fun!
Ah! I do not trust this lion.
Vitaly, I may not trust him, either,
but I am tired of sitting
and standing and rolling over.
It is great tradition
of sitting, standing, rolling over.
You know our circus is in trouble.
This could be our last chance.
But we will not do this without you.
Circus always stay together.
<font color="#D900D9">(sighs)</font> OK. I do one hoop.
<font color="#D900D9">(squeals)</font>

to be a human cannonball!
Except, you know...
a sea lion cannonball.
Is it dangerous?
Is it dangerous?
Yes, of course it's dangerous!
- Now, are you sure about this?
- I'm sure.
'Cause if blowing up is your thing,
then you in the right place.

Whoo! I was flying! I was effin'-L-Y-in'!
I'm proud of you, but... <font color="#D900D9">(whimpers)</font>
...I don't think
I can hold on much longer!
Oh, yeah, right.
Sorry about my enthusiasm.
Here, wrap this around you.

- Hand over that circus, Freddie!
- I'll have your guts for garters!
Hey, hey, put your weapons down.
Guys, chill out. Cute and cuddly's
obviously not your thing.
He's got us pegged.
I got a better idea. Show 'em, Rico.

<font color="#D900D9">(Freddie)</font> I want to try that!
- Jonesy! Jonesy!
Whoo! Hey. Hi.
I admire how you
have inspired these animals.
Oh, thanks.
And what you said about passion,
it was like poetry.
I love passion and poetry.
They go together, really.
- I know they don't rhyme.
- Trapeze is my passion!
Terrific. I look forward
to seeing you up there.
You can teach me!
- What?
- Teach me.
Well, I've always
been kind of a solo act.
So that kind of rules that out.
I wonder if you actually do trapeze.
- Oh, I actually do do trapeze.
- Show me!
"Show me"? What are we, five?
I am five, yes.

- OK.
- Come to me.
<font color="#D900D9">(stammering)</font> I can't.
It's just like dancing, Melman.
Two steps forward, one step back.
I can't dance, OK? There, I said it.
Maybe because you've never tried.
No, I have tried.
I practiced in private
because you dance so well.
You practiced? For me?
Yes, but it's no use.
I never know
what to do with my arms.
<font color="#D900D9">(shouting)</font>
- Hold it.
That part is so easy, Melman. OK?
'Cause all you have to do
is put them around your partner.
See? Two steps forward.
One step back.
- I'm dancing. I'm dancing!
- Two steps forward...
- We're dancing on a tightrope!

So when do we get
the jet packs and aquatic cobras?
Uh, this is a beginners' class,
and that's a pretty advanced maneuver.
OK, how do we begin?
It's a bit complicated
unless you understand
the whole pitch and yaw...
arc and gravity.
All that stuff,
which I won't bore you with. OK.
- Do you need a push?

Shh! Don't make it

- What are we gonna do?
- We'd better vamoose... pronto.
But we're not ready.
We're in the middle of rehearsals.
Then why don't you lilt over,
grab your peduncle,

Of course we're ready! Born ready!

Private! Tell them the eagle has landed.
The eagle has landed!
Roger that.
Oh, and keep an eye out for Dubois.
Aye, aye, guvnor!
The promoter is in the house!
- New York is closer than ever!
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
First, we got a circus to do.
We're on, folks!
- Do we go on before or after the dogs?
- Yes.
- What?
- Overlap, your acts overlap.
- Where's Vitaly? He opens.
- I don't know.
Stefano! Hey, Stefano!
Have you seen Vitaly?
<font color="#D900D9">(Stefano weeping)</font>

Stefano, why the sad little face?
Vitaly... he will not go on!

Wipe away the tears. Calm down.
Where is he?
I'm sure I can reason with him.
- Vitaly, what are you doing?
- You missed.
You're leaving? You're just gonna
walk out on everybody?
They have good show without me.
Look, I got a good left foot,
but without my right foot, I can't walk.
You get fake foot, then you walk.
- I don't want fake foot! OK?

Stop being this guy! Be the other guy!

The guy who was all circus!
The guy who jumped through hoops!
Give me that!
The guy everybody looked up to.
Come on. Where's that Vitaly?
That Vitaly is no more.
Listen, man.
You may have given up on yourself,
but your friends
haven't given up on you.
Are you just going
to turn your back on them,
and sit and eat borscht
the rest of your life?
Or are you gonna get out there
and jump through that tiny little hoop?
<font color="#D900D9">(groans)</font> It is impossible.

It was always impossible, Vitaly.
That's why the people loved it.
That is why I loved it.
Because I did the impossible!

You are from a zoo?
Yes. Yes. But wait, there's more.
- More?
- Or less. There's less.
You were never circus?
We had to say we were circus.
Or you'd never have let us on the train!
After all we have
been through together...
...you want to go live in a zoo?
- Gia, I...
- You used us.
No, no, no. I mean, yes, but...
Trapeze americano,
you make that up, too?
It didn't exactly exist
when I taught it to you.
Jet packs and aquatic cobras!
I should have known.
Balloons to the children of the world
was not real, either?
Yeah, that's not real.
But look at what we did.
I was shot out of a cannon!
I could have died!
But I thought it was
your lifelong dream.
For all I know,
your name is not even Alice.
No, Stefano, but it never really was.
I don't feel safe! <font color="#D900D9">(whimpering)</font>

We trusted you.

You can still do cannon solo.
But... I want to do solo act with Marty!
And what do I do?
Go back to sitting
and standing and rolling over?
No.
We can do impossible!
And we never go back
to way we used to be.
The way it used to be
isn't the way it was.
And it won't be the same without them,
whatever way it is.

- Home.
- Huh.
My rock looks smaller
than I remember it.
Look at the mural.
Doesn't actually capture
the real thing, does it?
Wow.
I forgot about that wall
in between us, Melman.
- Mm-hmm.
- Was that always there?
Guys, I'm sorry
I ever left the zoo in the first place.
What do you mean?
I mean, if I had just stayed put,
we wouldn't have
anything to be sad about right now.
Leaving the zoo was the best thing
that ever happened to us.
Really?
Yeah. Out there, in the world,
we were really living.
<font color="#D900D9">(Julien)</font> Yeah!
- It was exciting!
- It was romantic.
- It was dangerous.
I never felt so alive!
When we were with the circus,
we were already home.
I only wish we'd realized that sooner.
I'm really going to miss those guys.
What do you say we go back?
Really?
- I'm with you!
- I'm in!
But what do we tell them?
We make it right by telling them
how wrong we were.
It's worth a shot.
