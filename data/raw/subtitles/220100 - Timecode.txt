I don't remember
the details... except that...
Thirty seconds.
Except that...
Alex was lying
on his back.
Fifteen seconds.
- Eight, seven...
- Six.
...three, two, one.
But I couldn't hear
what he was saying.
And there was just this tiny,
tiny wound.
Almost like a cut where the
scab has been pulled off...
and it's seeping blood.
But there was an awful
lot of blood coming from...
this tiny... little... cut.
And the tissues I was...
laying down weren't
soaking it up.
And so what did you do when they didn't...
didn't soak it up?
Kept pressing on it.
With... with the same tissues or...
Yeah. And with my...
Just with my fingers.
And then what?
I don't know.
What was Alex doing?
He was... trying to...
Trying to tell me things.
What kind of things?
Some in Swedish.
Um...
Swedish things that
you've heard before? Or...
It was very hard to
understand what he was saying.
And I woke up... I think, not
really knowing what had gone on.
Did he know that
he was in... in some sort of pain in
the dream or he was just unaware?
He seemed
to be...
almost... almost happy.
Happy?
So... so he was happy and he
was bleeding from this... from
this very little cut and
you had a tissue.
Yeah.
...that couldn't soak
up the blood.
Yes. And that was all
you had and you kept
dabbing it with the
tissue and he was...
he was talking to you
in Swedish...
Happily.
- Yes.
- And he was using
endearments or... I don't know.
I think so.
And... and... and
what did you do after?
I'm not sure.
Let me ask you
something.
Um, I'm just going to
give you a few words.
And I just want you to tell me the
first thing that comes into your head.
Uh... okay?
Okay, sleep.
First thing, don't take time
to think, just first thing.
- Sleep.
- EXEC.
Blood.
Fresh.
Tissue.
Fluffy.
Happy.
Sad.
When you woke up... This was last night
when you were at your friend's house?
- Yeah.
- What did you do?
I took a Melatonin,
a tablet to help me sleep.
Then I... woke up
and came here.
So you take something to
fall asleep a lot? No, no.
But you happen to have
them with you?
I carry them with me.
What happened?
Oh.
- Hi. How are you?
- Hello.
What time's your meeting?
In 20 minutes.
- What?
- In 20 minutes.
Well, we don't have time to call AAA.
Do you want a ride?
There's no need for
dramatics. I'll take you.
Thank you, Lauren.
You are so generous.
- What's that attitude?
- No attitude.
So two nights ago I decided to...
I had to leave the house...
- Red Mullet?
- Because...
Sir, what's in the bag?
- Alex was...
- Massage chair.
- Upset.
- Red Mullet.
So, we'll call you later.
Okay? Okay.
I'll put you through. Okay.
I'm Quintus from Roman Springs.
People call me Q.
Uh-huh. I've come
to do the massage.
Oh, wonderful. What kind
of massage do you do?
Gently caressing the soft
tissue, Swedish technique.
Deeper penetration, I use a
shiatsu technique. Mm-hm.
Massage auras, hover chakras,
what makes you cum. Excuse me?
House and go stay with my friend.
Red Mullet.
So I just... took a
couple of things with me.
Um, well, do you set up or...
I didn't think I'd...
I have a chair which
I could put there,
but generally I visit people
in their work stations...
I'm just curious
about the pills.
- Red Mullet.
- Because of the...
Oh, he's... Let me put you to voicemail.
Okay. Well, all the
executives are in one big
meeting right now.
Well, that's excellent. I can attack
the mother lode in one place.
Like going to a Web.
Massage their
egos, that's for sure.
Oh, that's par for the course
and then I can spread out...
Right, but if you can just be
really subtle. I am subtle...
And discreet.
You won't even hear me.
Hi. This is Q from Roman Springs.
He's a massage therapist.
Hail!  Egos sum Quintus, your
friendly gladiator. People call me Q.
I'm from Roman Springs and I say to
your tension, " Veni vidi vici."
This is the friend of the friend
from Roman Springs so they usually
send over little sort of
little, uh, gift just to
entice us to go to Roman
Springs for the retreat.
I was expecting just a fruit
basket, but I guess this is a...
And even if he
comes to bed at five in
the morning, I still know that
he's coming to bed at some time.
- In the lower back...
- If we can do this,
- we've got a meeting running.
- He has a bad back.
Keep up with... Yeah.
I would urge them to
- avail themselves with some...
- He's got a bad back
physical education
at Roman Springs.
Guys, we've got a situation
on the set of Teen Scene.
There's a...
Ow, go easy on me...
Outbreak of herpes and
it's really a nightmare.
I mean, the insurance
company's given us two
more days and then we gotta
make a decision.
Nobody's found out
who the source is?
Uh, well, I think they're
trying to avoid naming names.
- Is there a medic?
- Yeah. Four down.
They've done everything
they can with Blistex...
Been together... and
cover-up, but it's just
a situation to be forewarned of. We
might have to hold up production.
You should put the
leads in separate hotels.
Long enough to...
- Did you go by the set?
- Feel like a long time.
Yeah. I went yesterday, which is
why I couldn't go to Lancaster.
I had to fire the A.D. I'm sorry. I
didn't wanna get sister-girl on him,
but I had to. You know, he challenged
me, so... But morale is up. So...
- Yeah. You go girl.
- Yeah. You know?
Looks like you
got 'em.
There I am. That's it, that's it.
That's all. Walk in.
Boost morale, by firing somebody.
That's... Hey.
A little update on John Tammer.
Oh. John Tammer.
Yeah, we had to fire... I had to fire
five of the producers last night
because somebody was caught
embezzling money so...
Holy cow. They go down like
flies in this organization.
- He seems to be...
- Well, what? He was...
Really caught with
his hand in the till? Or...
- Is it your friend?
- Falling apart.
All right. Well, we
we won't talk about it.
Got this reckless... What can
you tell us about  Madeline?
The desk cards came back and most of
the comments was that it wasn't scary.
Reckless. It's plain scary,
so that's pretty good.
We're living almost as if he's
happier when he's falling apart.
The problem
is that I heard the rough cut
and apparently the sound
effects are such
that the Buddhists, when
they set themselves on fire,
aren't crackling. They are sort
of popping and exploding and...
It's adding a comic
undercurrent to an otherwise.
- Hey how are you?
- Fairly serious visual.
Now, uh, it's gonna
push us somewhat
- farther into the red.
- I wish I didn't
care so much. You know,
we have to address it.
- No way around it.
- That's your call.
- That's my observation.
- Uh, it's a good call.
Same thing for  Flicker of Light. We got soft
focus a few days in a row and there's...
That might not be
a bad thing.
Because she's not a
spring chicken anymore.
Looks like  Playboy.
Jesus Christ,
what's that?
Five point six.
Good old Hollywood,
that's all.
Is that a term I used?
So don't worry.
Everything's fine. No, if
you want to, but it's fine.
You all right?
Everybody okay?
- Honey, you okay?
- We came down.
But I really...
You're a fucking slut.
And you are a fool if you don't
think I know what's going on.
Ah! I've had it!
I have absolutely had it!
You know, you can't go on
like this. It's not going on!
- The gravy train is over!
- Lauren.
When we get back, you can just
pack your bags and leave.
'Cause I am not a fool!
I got enough to worry about.
I gotta try and... Oh, God.
You've gone
fucking mad.
No. I have not gone mad.
Yes, you've gone mad.
- No.
- You've gone mad.
How have I gone mad? What
the fuck is your problem?
What is my problem?
You are my problem. You!
- You all right?
- I wanted to ask you...
What did I do now? Oh, what did you do now?
You've never done
anything wrong. I don't know
what's been going on the past
few months. You know, if you don't think
I don't notice the phone calls...
Oh, God... been going on for the
past few months? I've had...
I think you're
gonna make a great
actress, let's just put it that way.
A great actress.
- What is your problem?
- Smells strong.
I told you,
my problem is you.
Okay. What's the story
on the  Blind Venetians?
Uh, the  Blind
Venetians are...
essentially that they've been
scheduled to open on President's Day.
My love, my time,
my money.
My recommendation is
that they move it back to
Helen Keller's birthday
just to...
I'm sorry, Darren. We need to have a
serious talk about Alex being late.
I mean... he lives three blocks
away. This is ridiculous.
It's unprofessional.
It's unfair to us.
Sweetie, we just got through
having a serious talk about it.
- I made it clear...
- With us. Connie...
He's my best friend.
I'm tired of
waiting.
We can get a little
more done before he gets here.
That's the point.
We're tryin' to...
- There he is.
- Here... here he comes.
As if on cue.
You won't have to pay
for anything for much longer.
Well, I don't mind paying for anything.
Listen to me...
I don't mind... I'm
getting my shit together.
And I'm getting out of your
life, if that's what you want.
The man will
rock and roll.
We gotta roll with
the man's punches because...
- Fine.
- Fine.
That's why this company
is what it is.
- Rock and roll.
- I don't mind...
- I don't mind...
- If this is a hump,
I'm willing to help him get
over this hump. I just...
I don't know how long
this hump is gonna...
What I mind is being a fool.
It's a big hump.
Did you have your feet bound?
No.
No. I think we should
perform an intervention.
And I know that most of the
time they're not successful,
but I think that this is
something we should try for him.
Hey, Rose, it's Alex.
- I know it.
- You can't talk.
I wasn't sure if it was
today or tomorrow.
If we're one for today,
say something like...
You have a bad connection.
Mary, I can't hear
you. We have a bad connection.
Let me speak to
Mary.
Listen, Lauren wants to
talk to you.
Gimme the phone.
Mary. Hello?
- Hello? Mary.
- Hello.
- Go back to it.
- Hello.
Jeff, man.
How's it goin', dude?
I stumbled into it... Hey, Randy.
It's really good shit.
- When I was younger.
- Move on...
From the jungles
of Bolivia.
ROSE I understand, I know
I'm a burden to you.
I don't wanna be.
I'm trying, you know.
I'm trying.
I can't handle
this anymore.
I can't handle the
pressure.
How does it make you feel?
Supposed to be.
You're supposed to
be the good thing in my life.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, right
now, I have this feeling...
Well, I'm sorry I'm the bag
thing in your life, Lauren.
- No.
- I truly am.
No, no. Look me
in the eye. Right now.
Look me in the eye and tell
me that there is no one else.
Tell me th...
You didn't tell me.
I love you. I love you, too. I do.
So, look me in the eye...
and tell me.
- Stop this.
- See you can't do it.
Look, there's no one
else in my life, Lauren.
You happy now?
There's no one else,
you swear.
How many times? There's
no one else. I swear.
I don't know how to swear to
you. I don't know how to...
I just don't know what to
do anymore. I mean...
Okay, that's fine.
- Morning, everybody.
- Hey, hey.
Hey. How was the trip?
I'm sorry I'm late.
The traffic was, uh...
- So what do we have?
- We got a full plate.
I got a lot of stuff
we all read last night.
Right? Get some opinions.
Has anyone seen Maria?
Yeah.
Is she under the chair?
She's being stepped on.
I love you so much.
- Dirty subject.
- Tell me.
Yes. That's not
realistic.
The fact that Alex
drinks so much...
That was the typing.
Why don't they
ever make movies like...
There's no movies for
Latinos. Jennifer Lopez.
Yeah, as a maid?
As a promiscuous maid?
Well, what... Listen. Ask
us when you wanna play...
Okay. So...
what about...
In A Box.
An amazing script.
I haven't read a good script
like this since
The Color Purple.
And  Cosign. It's a group of
frustrated black actors in Hollywood.
They get so enraged with...
with feeling isolated, with
feeling marginalized, tired of
being the token splash of
color in a movie and they...
they just embody this Marcus
Garvey period,
you know, back to Africa,
while they're having coffee...
Sometimes I'm just
living in my own head.
Pat, could you pull over when you see
a newsstand? And I don't understand.
I need cigarettes
A lot of the world.
Black people are more than just gangs
and shooting each other's brains...
No. You know, that's not
what I'm talkin' about.
No, what you're saying, Evan, is that
you only think blacks are commercial
when they're shooting each
other's brains. I mean...
No, you know perfectly
well that's not what...
Blacks can be multi-dimensional.
Okay. We'll move on.
This is an issue that has got
great crossover potential.
This is about the black
diaspora.
This is what Hollywood.
It's a good show. Crossover lead.
Will Smith is accessible.
I mean, it's really
difficult for, uh... very
very demanding part
very full, rich you know,
she tries to kill herself,
she's a slut, she's a bitch,
She has a heart of gold and...
To play all those notes, it really would
be better if you had read the script.
But you didn't, so, um...
Too far gone?
Oh, that... that... that's the...
that's the... The Shine.
- The Shine.
- Except the guy's got,
- a lot more problems.
- More problems.
I would love you anyway.
The man you love and
he's leaving forever.
Can we do a little improv?
Do you mind? Yeah.
Uh, Zee, can you... do you mind
if you're a boat? Just be a boat.
Yeah. You know. Here.
Here you go. A boat. Right?
What's the tone of the movie? Is it
just sort of, like, comedy or drama?
Drama. Drama.
It's a very deep, rich
melodrama and, uh, this...
this... a lot of sex, but
the sex is routed in the storyline and
it's all based upon her character
because she's sleeping her way to the
top of the public relations firm in
uh, in Saint Louis,
Missouri.
Patch, lock the doors.
Hello? Hello? Check. One, two.
Hello. Hello? Check, check,
Check, check, check,
check, check, check.
I still see the
innocent girl you used to be
before Amanda got killed
in that tragic boat accident.
I think that it's
a very ugly place.
Oh, God Jason, it feels so
good to unburden myself.
I think sometimes there
are moments of real beauty.
- Unlock the door.
- Like a smile.
Hm. A smile.
ROSE Why'd you lock the door.
- What else?
- Love all over again.
- Falling asleep together.
- Very nice. Sorry.
After all your lies...
Now that I've found
you, I do.
Your lover.
...where the conflict
happened.
And so that would mean that
the people who watch the.
History Channel they would
probably watch this movie.
- Knowing you're loved.
- But it also catches
the teen market because it's a boy and
girl who have just finished their
freshman year at Harvard and they're in...
the... the bush, and this girl
is shaving her legs... long, brown legs.
Been in the bush for an, uh, a
few weeks and she's
shaving the slit.
Blood trickling down. Big pool
of blood. A lotta blood.
And... and... and... and...
and then you cut to like
a wide shot and she and her
boyfriend on the banks of this...
Renee, is there a script on this?
So far?
So far? That they
get into the river
and the... the camera, like,
gushes down below the water.
It's mur... murky, muddy... Sweetie,
do we have a script on this? Can we
just... Is it something we can read?
There's a worm.
It's like... like a glass noodle
worm, like the kind usually...
- That's sounds really...
- In Japanese
restaurants, you know, the glass
noodle worm. I mean, noodles? And...
and that's what the worm is like...
What about... what
about the whole  South Park thing?
Are we excited about that?
- Oh, I like that.
- South Park?
South Park? Oh, well,
the  South Park thing is... is
kind of exciting to me. Alex,
I'd love for you to chime in.
This has got to me by
Debbie Weavling.
And, uh, this is the
South Park guys,
Matt Stone, Trey Parker.
They've written a script.
Granted the title might... it's
a working title,  Time Toilet.
Essentially  Time Toilet is...
a janitor working on a nuclear
energy facility discovers that the
toilet of the men's room is actually
a time portal and they've been
inadvertently flushing
waste products back in time. Subtly
changing time. Obviously, this is
a sci-fi comedy with historical,
uh, value because there are
there are several, um, tableaux that
we hit upon. Most notably is the, uh,
assassination of Lincoln which is foiled
because just as John Wilkes Booth
is raising his pistol to the back
of our sixteenth President's head,
Whoosh. Wilkes Booth is
washed with waste, uh,
flushed from today back then.
That would be Mrs. Lincoln.
So now he has to
flush himself back in time to kill Lincoln.
So that's our hero.
Great. It is a good opportunity.
Yeah. It's cameos, it's historical,
it's educational and it's
funny as hell. You like it?
I love it.
Oh, my God.
I love Johnny Depp.
I saw him the other night at the
Viper Room and he is so hot.
Great soundtrack. We can " Bill and
Ted" the whole thing, you know?
Garbage. I don't even
listen to garbage.
- Cornhole.
- Cornhole!
What do we think of
Ricky Skaggs?
I...I... I... I...I
No. Right? We hate it.
He wants to
hang out and read it again.
Do you have a tissue,
please?
- Break a leg.
- You break a leg.
Um, I, uh, d... did
you f... feel something...
sh... shaking?
- BPT.
- BPT?
Best People in Town.
Then wouldn't it be...
I'm just curious.
But didn't you think that...
Whatever script that was
you read...
Really?
That's your agency?
Well, I wish it
was my agency. I...
Wouldn't that be
BP... I... T?
Well, you know, Best People Tell.
I don't know, Lauren.
But it's better than nothing.
Don't worry. I'll get an agent.
I know you will.
And what's this part
you're auditioning for?
I'm auditioning
for the part of a teacher.
Dressed like that?
Who used to be a shepherd.
Dressed like that?
She wanted to be a
teacher all her life and...
She's young, 18 years old, a
brilliant genius director.
I just can't over the
fact that...
- Meeting today?
- She is so young.
What were we all
doing at 18?
I think I was
collecting stickers.
She's makin' a movie
for thirty thousand that
- translates to... what is it?
- Sixty million.
- Grossed $60 million.
- Not bad.
So she would read books
as she was tending the sheep.
While she was
preparing herself...
Yeah. That's right,
she did all the music.
The owner of the ranch
where she tended the sheep
- had many kids.
- Like seven?
The youngest one... He has seven children.
Like seven? She had...
The youngest one
got into an accident...
He almost drowned and she saves his life.
So the owner of the
hacienda asks her what she wants
in return for saving his son.
- Hi.
- How old are you?
- She says...
- ...the documentary...
- Oh, no.
- It's amazing.
I've seen pictures of her. She's beautiful.
She's coming in today.
Is she really? Yeah. Oh, wow.
- You're 40, yeah?
- No, no, like 45.
Uh, I... I'm... 41.
Alex, the thing about Ana is that
she's got European sensibilities.
Hurray!
She's Italian... Venezuelan.
A combination of three things.
But she speaks five languages and we
thought you'd be able to talk to her.
She doesn't really look Egyptian.
She looks like a mutt.
She speaks intellectual.
She speaks smart.
I forgot to tell you that his
wife had died. Of course.
I think I've seen
this. Is this a musical?
She's like a big wad
of cash with a head on it.
Yeah. She's gonna
walk in our door.
Did you read the script?
I read it.
I never saw you
read the script.
'Cause I didn't read the script,
Lauren, I read the synopsis.
Why?
I don't even know why I bother.
Did I lose my mind?
Of course not, they're
gonna give me a scene.
That I will see for the first time
and then I... I'm very good... but
I'll just, um, I'll read
off the page.
An Asian, a black girl, I want a
white girl. I want to give you
- the whole gamut of racial...
- Wait, wait, wait,
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Poor white trash...
If you cast a
black woman... You know.
We talked about this. You're
taking bitch out of the title.
Oh. Okay. All right. But
it's just derogatory.
- That's a good idea.
- I thought we liked this.
I kind of like bitch.
- I... I like bitch.
- I like bitch.
- Dressed like that?
- Anywhere I dress...
I mean, doesn't matter how I dress. I am...
I am still the right person
for the part. You
want some respect?
Yes. And I will earn it with my acting.
Well, why don't
you earn it right now by just
covering up your breasts.
I can change it.
I mean this word takes so much negativity.
I mean, with female violence? Battery?
- You like this, right?
- Abuse.
I'm a bad person.
It would make me feel good.
No, I'm doin' it.
Stop the nagging
and I'll do it.
There, happy?
- See you at home later.
- No, I'll wait on you.
Oh, no, no, no. No, I
thought we were gonna do.
Oh, I can give you
instruction...
What made you
think that?
No. You're going
home and I'll meet you there.
Or you're going wherever
you were going...
What are you talking about?
You're wasting our time.
Darren why do they call
it a budget?
They call it a budget so
you don't budge from it.
It works every time.
Thanks for the ride. I'll be out here.
I'm gonna be out here.
No. Readin' the paper. I got
a lot of business to do.
Have a good audition.
- I might be a long time.
- Okay. I'll be here.
From 21 to 18 day
shoot. Right?
Weren't we talkin' about that
last time on the telephone?
Yeah.
Twenty-one to 18.
Wait, wait. We were
talkin' about 24 days.
We talked about 21.
Now it's down to 18.
Alex, wh... what...
Can you do in 18?
18 days, I can do it better. I'm
gonna give you a better product.
All right, uh, okay, good, good.
Keep it raw and gritty.
That's what your style was?
Man, that's your grandpa.
Okay, no problem and no... I mean,
I'll use my handheld... I... I...
Let's do
it for 30,000.
The film should make 60 million, right?
So you can do it for 18.
Okay. Okay. Production values are
not gonna suffer. Believe me.
You're gonna love
this rock and roll.
Welcome. What can she
do in 18 days? A lot.
Can I talk about the
ending?
I was thinkin' about changing
the ending. I had some ideas.
Oh, oh. I think a
feel-good happy ending...
No, no, no.
Lester, let's stick to
the plan...
I think we need to
stick to what is written
and you have to work within those
boundaries the way you work so well.
Okay.
Provided you're at peak form
and you're in your health...
- Right, right.
- And all that...
You got some friends. You'll
be able to pull some names...
- You an actress?
- Yeah.
Are you here for the audition?
Mm-hm.
- You're pretty.
- You're pretty.
- No, you're beautiful.
- You think so?
Whoa, whoa. What... what
do you mean two days?
- Why are you sweating?
- I'm not sweating.
But what do you mean two days
in turnaround? Alex...
Alex, what... what is that two days
in turnaround business? What is this?
Sorry, Lester,
you only have two days,
but you can cast it in
two days, couldn't you?
I've been tryin' since
I... this is my fifth week and.
- I haven't casted 'em yet.
- You'll manage.
Lester, you're clean,
aren't ya?
You're clean, right?
I mean...
We're all adults here.
Um, there's... there's
been a couple rumors and, uh, I just wanted
to make sure you're not using again.
No. I'm not using...
Of course, I'm not using.
Everyone takes a cast and crew
physical before we go into production.
- Are you trying to...
- Insurance purposes.
I'll be right with ya. What
are you talkin' about?
I don't think he's
using.
We're pretty much done,
aren't we?
We'll show you...
our arms if you show us yours.
Take notes, Connie, really.
The other one.
I...I wanted to
talk to you...
EVAN. The other one. The other one.
All right. No, no,
- Come on, come on.
- Show us the other arm.
- This is a joke...
- There's your answer.
Alex, what's going on?
There's your answer.
- All right, screening.
- So what you been up to?
Screen test is in...
Okay. And I'll see you there.
Just wanted to say
hello.
Yeah.
Alex, come on, man.
What is that shit? Two
days? Two days I've been tryin'
to get this for five weeks now.
Don't worry... Two days. What
do you mean don't worry?
If I didn't know you so well,
I'd think you were a racist.
- You're pushing it.
- No I'm not pushing it.
- What?
- What're you doing?
I gotta see my wife.
Uh, I'll talk to you later.
So you'll come back?
Are you gonna come back...
So, no
flowers, no cards,
no presents and not even a phone call
and it was my birthday yesterday.
- You're full of shit.
- I am.
But if it would have been my
birthday, would you have called?
Okay, kids, uh, you
wanna hear the good news or
you wanna hear the bad news?
- Good news always.
- All right, the good
news is there ain't no good news.
There's only bad news. I got two days
to cast this movie or
they're pullin' the plug.
They cut my days
down from 24 to 21 days.
And they think I'm fuckin' usin'
drugs again, God dammit. Fuck!
Lester, you are
using drugs again.
I've been thinking.
If I took a couple weeks off,
maybe a month.
We could just take a plane
to Venice.
Or Florence. A plane to Florence and then
drive south for a couple of hours and, uh,
and rent a villa, maybe in Chianti
or why not by the coast. You know?
Cook our own food and no scripts,
no cell phones, no faxes.
Only books that can't be made into movies.
And we'll swim naked.
I'll lick the salt off your body
while you're drying in the sun.
Can I look?
Yeah. Of course you can
look. Look in the top drawer.
...money to accomplish
all my desires.
I now have enough time
and energy...
To accomplish all
my desires.
I am the calm, especially the
peace, and I see love in everyone.
I am the calm,
especially the peace,
and I see love in everyone.
I am the calm, especially the
peace, and I see love in everyone.
It's very hard to stop drinking
when you're not at home.
You know, I can't... I can't
work, I can't sleep.
I believe in infinite  aboondance.
Abundance.
And the money is always
there...
You know what I think
we should do? We should...
We should buy a
house.
Buy a house in Tuscany,
and move there. You don't
like L.A. anyway, do ya?
Moving to London is not such a good idea.
So let's... let's leave this town.
For all the radiation
in her earlobe.
- Do you love me?
- Is that what you think?
What I think is not the
point. Do you love me?
I accept it. No.
Every day I...
I wish I didn't love you quite so much.
Every day...
Well, then, I think we
should live together
and I think you should
come back home.
Every day...
And we'll...
work things out.
I know that you've been a bit
unbalanced lately, but,
uh, maybe you should see
someone, talk to someone.
Alex? You're with us at the screening?
Yeah, sure.
Sorry to interrupt. I
am vibrantly healthy...
Jesus. I wanna
get outta here.
I am vibrantly healthy...
What do you say?
I am vibrantly...
I am always in the right
place at the right time.
I am always at the right
place at the right time.
Okay, okay. Okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
- Alex?
- Yeah.
I'm going to leave you.
Yeah.
I understand.
Get out, get out of
there. It's me. I'm outside.
Puppy, go home. I'll
take a taxi. It'll be okay.
No, no, come on out.
ROSE. Puppy, I'm in line, I have
to go in and do my audition.
You don't understand,
it's not worth it.
Puppy, go home.
You don't know how hard
it was to get this audition.
I cannot do that.
I'll be fine.
Just go home. I'll take a
taxi. It'll be okay.
Hello? Yeah, hi Bunny.
Hey, how you doing?
Oh, just fine. How you doing?
It's making me crazy.
Yeah. This is a...
I'm a little early.
I'm outside your offices.
I thought if you got a second, why don't
we grab a cup of coffee, something.
I wanna talk to you.
Got a minute?
I'm actually in a
meeting right now.
You are. Oh.
All right. All right.
Well, listen, uh, I'll take a rain check.
I wanna get
together with you sort of, you know,
away from all the business. Okay?
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- Great.
Oh, and, um, one other thing.
I wanna give you a heads up.
Ana Powells wants to bring in her
boyfriend into this pitch meeting.
And, uh, you know, normally, I would
say no, but, uh, his name is Joey.
Zee. He's in this band, Walk Don't
Run, and... and, uh, this thing just
went platinum. So...
 Hello? He wants to
do the soundtrack. I think
it will be a great addition.
Hi, how are you? And she seems,
you know, very intent on
having him there, so I thought no
problem, but... Are you a little busy?
Would you do me a
favor and let everybody know?
- Absolutely.
- Great. I think...
uh, and let's see what
they have to offer...
Remember I had that
audition today?
It was good. He wants me to stay and
maybe read it with him again later.
Yeah, yeah.
It's good.
He gave me shit about the script.
See you in half an hour.
- I'll see you in half.
- Okay.
You should've sent it.
Thanks, Alex.
You didn't send the
script.
It does matter 'cause this is not
the first time this has happened.
- Alex.
- Hey, Rose.
Where the hell are you?
Listen to me.
Uh, I'm on my
way. I'm in a meeting
right now, but I'll be... I'll be right...
right with you.
Shh. There... there's
people... there's
people in the room. There's
people in the screening room.
What? After
everything I've done?
What?
I forgot about that.
I signed with you,
not with your assistant.
I forgot about that.
If you don't respect
me, then...
After everything
that's happened.
Because I still see the little girl
might want to come... innocent
one. Before the tragic
accident...
They're here.
- Boating accident.
- What?
I got a better
idea. I'm gonna hang up.
Yeah. The truth...
the truth will - the
- truth will set you free.
- Oh, yes, yes.
What? After all your lies, do
you know who you are anymore?
No, but I found you, I did. Hey.
Oh...
I still believe you.
Oh Jason.
Is this the old Valerie or
is this the new one?
Or is this the new new one?
It's the new new one.
Now that you're here, everything
is brand spanking new new.
Okay and ready, Diamond?
I'm ready.
And action.
- Diamond...
- Actress...
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You have a light?
- A light?
Yes, sure.
I mean, she seems
very... sweet.
- Do I know you?
- Do I know you?
No.
Oh yeah.
It's so good.
Now that I've found you...
I was just...
Just do your lines.
Keep it going, just keep it going.
I have to get more. That... that
orgasm. Orgasm. That's good. Orgasm.
That's good, that's good. Okay,
you can come down now.
Okay. One more... Okay, action.
Everything is
just brand spanking new.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
One more take.
Okay, action.
Third one, this is
Jessica...
She's reading for
the bitch's mother?
It feels so good
to unburden myself.
Keep it going.
Oh yes.
I want it, I...
It's supposed to be the first take.
This is the second take.
That's okay,
we can get an idea, Lester.
It doesn't matter. She's bad.
She's a bad actress.
Amateur hour. But, um, I thought
I'd give you a racial gamut.
No. Colorblind
auditioning is great.
No? It's good that it's colorblind.
It's, uh, it's tone deaf.
It's all those things.
- Hey.
- I missed you.
I missed
you, too.
O Rose thou art sick.
The invisible worm,
That flies in the night.
In the howling storm:
Has found out thy bed
Of crimson joy:
And his dark secret love.
Does thy life destroy.
That's beautiful. Did
you write that for me?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
Well, I had some help
from a guy named Blake.
It's okay. I made you a cake.
What?
I made you a cake. Yes, you did.
I'm serious. Oh,
glamorous. And it's fat free,
sugar free, too. I hope
you like it there.
I didn't realize that we
had a picnic.
Here. It's vanilla.
Vanilla.
Okay.
Come, come. We're
havin' a...
picnic, darling.
Don't want to forget to put my
underwear on. Really tragic.
We should
find Alex. I don't wanna
start this without Alex. It's just gonna
look bad and I, and I don't want it to
look bad. I want, I want
her to connect with us.
Didn't say a word.
She hardly said a word.
I mean, apart from the fact that it looks
bad that he's not here. He's the only one
that knows how to speak that obtuse
language. I mean, I spoke to Bunny
yesterday and he said this girl is
so smart, she's so like speaks in
another code. The other
thing is she may refuse
- to actually meet with us.
- Emma?
Hi. How
are you?
Oh, this is an amazing, They're
sugar free, fat free and
everything free. I can't
believe it isn't cake.
And you're telling the truth,
not just saying it. Yeah, I am.
No matter what we agree with,
with, with Anna, we just
support her, her
philosophy and everything.
What they will do. We will
do whatever she wants to do.
- Yeah.
- She's
- fantastic.
- Anna? Uh.
I thought
it was beautiful.
Yeah. That's
good. Save a lot of
money, too. Which is, uh,
makes us all happy. Yeah. How
are you? Oh, I'm good, you know.
Never stop.
- Work, work, work.
- Yeah.
But baby, It's dirty. We just
had sex there. Well, that's
so much better now. I'm
callin' you guys up. It seems
like we hadn't seen you
in forever. But, uh, I, uh,
Pig. And, uh, he always hates,
I'd like to take a minute.
I like the
things you do. Uh, maybe
I should just lay it out
there. I, I, I've heard some
talk, you know. I mean, um-
Do you remember you told me
you were gonna give me that
- audition?
- Did you get it?
I guess when Alex is on, you
know, there's nobody better.
But you're the boss. Yeah. I am
the boss. How is your tea?
But you're the boss. You
should be able to get it.
I am able to get it.
Because I saw they're auditioning
all these girls. You know,
I'm not asking you to give me the
part, I just wanna know, would you
please get me this audition?
You with me or not?
The, the company is,
is nothing like,
I bought a house in Tuscany and,
uh, I just moved there, you
know? That darn lifestyle.
Would you have babies with me?
Alex? Alex?
I really think he needs to get it
under control. Alex. Oh, Alex.
You aren't really wanna have babies.
But I can't have babies right now.
I'd really like to talk to you.
I, I'd love to do
that, but I want to have a career
first, you know? Of course,
of course. So, um, But that
would be my dream, baby,
if I could have this career going
and once it's going we could go to
Tuscany and have a baby, Yeah.
Uh, we go back,
- Have you seen Alex?
- No.
Yeah.
You look
good. Are you workin' or

- I have a
meeting. I gotta go, darling. I'm sorry.
Alex, you just got
here. I can't get you
an audition if I
don't have a company to run. I
have a company. I've got to go to
meetings. Where's my
jacket?
You know what?
I know,
Okay.
Okay. Good to see ya. Bye.
I go through a lot of trouble to
spend some time with you. Do you, I
don't know if you realize how much
trouble I go through and I bake you
some cake and you can't just come in
here and fuck me and just get out
of it. All right.

think it feels like?
It's gonna be okay soon.

I'm not a whore you know? You

I'm a huge fan. I couldn't take it
if you were kidding about that.
I would like

Wow.
Welcome to the Red Mullet.
Thank you.
He told me to... Yeah. Joe,

All right.
Cool. Do you think that's fine?
Sit here. Waitressing, cocktail
waitressing. Such bad calluses on my feet.
You need help

No. I think we,
I'm gonna paraphrase a
little bit, all right?
I love what you're

Okay. Here we go.

Tell a little about yourself.
I'm Rene. I'm Rene Fishbein. I'm.
I'm one of the
co-founders of the
company.
Hi I'm Dan Fetcher I'm, uh, executive
in charge of comedy acquisition and
development and, uh, and
company morale. Welcome.
And Adam Wand, once again, another one
of the co-founders, and Alex Greene.
Hi.
Hi. I'm, uh, Frank Connie,
um, Connie Lane, and, uh,
What? Connie. Connie Lane.
And I'm, uh.
Oh, I'm
sorry.
Uh, I'm the V.P. of
professional development.
Thanks for coming.
I'm - I'm,
uh, I'm Alex Richardson
and, um, also an executive producer.
I'm in charge of the urban
hip-hop movie sort of bringing in a sort
of black film noire. Cultural awareness.
Good for you. Thank
you for being here.
We're having auditions for
another film, so it's a little,
it's a little, You
done out there?
It's a little
goofy.
Off to the set. Gotta see it.
Gotta see it. Oh, Jason.
Oh, Jason. Oh, Jason.
Speaking with
Anna earlier today, she
said if she could make her film
here at Red Mullet, nothing would
make her happier and I know that's
the same way that you feel.
The feeling is collectively mutual.
Yeah.
Very good. Um, a number of
clients I've had, Uh, you
want some coffee? All have had
had terrific experiences.
So armed with nothing more than a
digital camera and an incredible
vision and the sounds of Joey, Joey
Zee, I think, uh, Anna's prepared to
drag us all kicking and screaming
into the next, Watch out!
Watch out! Everybody hang on!
Hang on! Take it easy.
What's going on?
Fucking earthquakes!
- Whoa.
- It's okay.
- You all right?
- Oh.
It's okay. Care about right now.
Is he all right? Yes.
All right. Everything's okay.
I don't
think, I'm, I'm gonna go outside.
Oh. Let's.
Let's go.
Yeah, go - go get Alex.
I was gonna,
Go get Alex.
Twenty million Russians, not enough
for bread. How's that gonna help
you with a bullet in your head? I don't
mean to preach, but I know that.
I'm right, when I say to you that
you're way too uptight. Diggy-diggy.
Trotsky in the house. Diggy-diggy.
I let him in my house.
Diggy-diggy.
That's how I make my life, staying
out too late, lying in his
bed he was so full of hate. I don't
mean to preach, but I know that.
I'm right. The world changed forever
on that weird, crazy night.
A diggy-diggy. Trotsky in the house,
diggy-diggy. I let him in the house,
Diggy-diggy. Diggy-diggy, make
love, not war, diggy-diggy.
Peace.
My film has
the necessity. The
urge to go beyond the
paradigm of collage.
Montage has created a fake
reality.
Technology has arrived. Digital
video has arrived. And is
demanding new expressions,
new sensations.
As Martin Gropius once said that
in the first Bauhaus exhibition:
Art, technology - a new unity.
We are in nineteen ninety-nine,
so it's time to say again, art,
technology, a new, new
unity.
Eisenstein and Bertrand...
Being
influenced by the Russian
formalism, with its theory of the
strangeness, the isolation of a word
within a poem. Of course, we are
talking about cinema, so it would
be the isolation of an image. The isolation
of a take. They create it. The soul
can't. Soviet Montage. The
discontinuity in editing.
At that time, that was a vanguard.
It's not that anymore.
The capitalistic system that we are
living in has absorbed all the
innovations, all the
vanguards.
It's time to
move forward, to move
beyond. It's time to think
in terms of matter.
Matter to send, to
receive, to organize.
Everything that exists is matter.
M, matter.
- Oh.
- Right, right.
It's time to go back to Leibniz
and his modern ideology.
It's time to update that.
My film will be an unmade
film. Not just mobile.
A film with not one single cut,
but one continuous moment.
Your boyfriend freaked me out a bit.
I didn't know
whether,
Joey?
He was suggesting we all sleep together
because he was high and felt like it.
As I was saying,
a film with
not one single cut, no ending. Real time.
The music of the film will be
the pulsations. A film with contractions,
with dilations, rhythms, rap songs.
As Kant once said, repetition is drama.
Repetition is
rhythm. Rhythm is music.
Therefore, music is drama.
I remember thinking that I
really liked him, but I didn't
want to go to bed with your
boyfriend, Hm. Really.
Imagine four cameras. Imagine
four cameras displayed in
the city. Imagine a
situationistic type of play.
A Guy Debord type of play.
A city as a jungle. Each
of these four cameras,
Each of these
four cameras will
follow a character. And the characters
are going to meet with each other,
creating the plot of the story,
creating the plot of the film.
I was thinking that a beautiful idea
could be to use one of Borgez' plays.
One of Borgez's tales - The Other. A
tale where a young man meets an old man.
They have a conversation and then they
realize that they are the same person. It
will be beautiful if these four
characters are exactly the same person
in different stages of his or their lives.
We're thinkin' about
Russia. I was there with Joey filming
his Walk Don't Run tour and we
fell in love with the city. We fell
in love with Russian music. We
fell in love with Russian souls.
That's why I want to have a subject, a
Russian subject in this film. Also, as
you might have heard before, we are
approaching the music of the film in
a dialect type of a way. Having a
modern melody. I was
thinking Hanns Eisler
but with a contemporary arrangement.
The audience would do the symbols.
I'm sorry?
Go on.
- Alex. Alex.
- I'm sorry.
The most pretentious crap
I've ever heard.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Could you
speak louder, please?
Well, you think anybody around this table
has a clue about what you're talking
about? No. But it's
time to educate people.
You know, we
think this is crap, but
we'll do it for you and then you do
our crap and that will be the tale.
Alex, you're way out of line.
I brought Anna here and I
brought Joey here and I
respect, Look at you.
I expect some respect. Come on,
Bunny. You're way out of line.
I want to know what you really
think about my project.
- What'd you do?
- I did it.
I think that there's no fucking way
to say anything about your project.
I think I've got
this movie.
Since it's wrapped up in
all those phases, from all
those books that you've read. But
obviously, you're very intelligent
and, um, probably very talented.
What?
I earned it. But
definitely very young.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. And the,
and the director noticed me,
So difficult to find an
honest person in this
town, but I really appreciate
what you are saying to me.
- Right.
- Thanks.
I really want to work with this one.
It's...
as a director, very time
consuming.
That's why they call him the king.
Well, when
Alex is on there's nobody better.
Director and
then the director saw me and he
immediately, me. He, He knew I had it and
he told me that he wanted to read
something and I read for him and
apparently, I, apparently, I did great.
I'm not just saying this.
You, you don't believe me. You
don't believe me. How's it
feel to be married to a rich
successful man? No. No, no, no.
I'm going to surprise you. Baby,
you're gonna be so proud.
No, I believe
you.
Going to be so proud of me.
No, I am proud of
you. I think I've got it.
I mean, I have to go
back again and read for the
producer, but, And, and
- who's the producer?
- I can do this.
I, I don't, I
don't know.
You don't know who the producer is?
No. I'm just gonna
go back in there and,
and, and do it now again.
So who's Alex?
- Who?
- Alex.
Are you sure you don't know who Alex is?
No, there was,
there were a lot of people in
there, you know? It was there for a
long time. But I don't remember
any Alex, no. What about the.
Bitch from Louisiana?
Well, what about it?
Listen, bitch. I listened to
everything that you said.
- What?
- You have a lot of...
- Oh, my God. What?
- I had a
microphone. I listened
everything you said, bitch!
Don't you hit me. I listened
to everything you said!
Oh, my God! Listened to
everything you said! He's
just using you! He's just using you!
He's just using you!
Alex. Alex.
Um, I'm
Alex. I'm Alex.
I'm Lauren.
Um. Lauren. I need everybody
to leave the room right
now. She said to leave 'em.
Leave 'em.
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, let's do this. Go.
Hey, Rose.
What's happening here?
Lauren. I'm sorry. I,
I, I'm truly, Lauren.
- Oh. Come here, Rose.
- Lauren.
- This is not so bad.
- I'm gonna get some...
Alex. Alex.
That's a lot of blood.
A lot of blood.
Don't be
afraid. Don't be afraid.
What has happened? I'm bleeding.
Can you, can you help me
out with my phone, please?
It's my,
Hello?
Hello, darling. Hello, Emma.
Hello. I love you. Hello.
Oh. I love
you, too, Emma.
I love you, too.
Can I see you tonight?
Um, couldn't you. Couldn't you order
a table at a nice restaurant?
