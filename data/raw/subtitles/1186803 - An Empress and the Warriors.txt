Ah Hu brother
Princess
There is only you and me here, dispense with the protocol
The father king has said
our country, Yan Guo was fought with all the masters of those swords
What his life's duty is to 
defends each and every inch of the land
Tomorrow's battle
Will the King win?
I will always remember when I was 15 years old 
The first time I go to war with the king
I saw, No matter has how many people go all out and risk their lives
Finally he will win
A single action has decided the war
Which controls all the people's life
He is like the Battle God
Do you need to worry about someone like that?
Your majesty,The enemy troop is coming
Physician! Physician! Physician!
Princess
I will help you to convey a message.Any family member?
Son.Five years old
I can tell him,
His father is the most heroic soldier
Attack!

Your majesty? Your majesty?
How?
What is it?
The King is injured
Carry the king in quickly! Quick! Quick!
Your majesty
Quick
Your majesty. Your majesty
Princess please quickly return to commander-in-chief's camp
Both physician,how is it?
The your majesty arrow wound is extremely serious
If the arrow is moved, his life will be in danger 
Say no more!
Genral,The military situation is very urgent,Cannot be delayed
Why don't you lead the troops?
I decided to hand over my command
Murong Shie-Hu
Your official, here!
Help me put Yan Guo's flag
into Zhao Jun's head
Yes, your majesty!
All of you withdraw and prepare to counter-attack
Yes
Shie-hu
Your majesty
Your majesty, be careful your wound
Don't worry your majesty
We will definitely win this war!
I know Hu-er
No matter how ruthles the enemy are
they will not be able to topple my Hu-er
I only worried about the enemy that you can't see
They are virtually impossible to guard against
Your majesty,don't worry about me just concentrate on healing your wound 
Go Hu-er
Go
How is the King?
Princess?
Your majesty injury is serious, can't delay any more
What should we do?
I will start the attack immediately
Take care of the King 
Father king
Fei-er
After Shie-hu's return,hand over Fei Yan Ren sword to him
Let him take care of our Yan Guo and you
Nothing will happen to you
Shoot!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Why are you here?
Why don't you let me be commander in chief?
Do you know how many of your subordinates died?
They should disregard their life for the country 
But they are also Yan Guo's subjects
In order to defend the country
They may sacrifice their lives
But we cannot let them die in vain
But then you cannot put your trust 
on an oprhan of unknown origin
Although he is without parents
But he never regarded himself as an orphan
He regards Yan Guo as his home
But I am your nephew
We are of the same bloodline
But whatever you do
Every battle
is all for your own ambition
You are wrong
Whatever I do, all is for Yan Guo
Only I can make it become formidable
This is not ambition
It's ideal
Father king
Your majesty,your majesty?
Before the King goes to battle
He said to me,if there is any mishap
The throne will be awarded to Murong Shie-Hu
Murong Shie-Hu
Is this a joke?
Or some problems with my ears?
Yan Guo,s throne have to pass to a person
A bastard, who doesn't know his own parents?
Tie Er-Pao
Speak with a clean mouth!
Who are you threatening?
Do I need to fear you, little soldier!?
In the sword,s hall,who dares to touch their sword!?
Tie Er-Pao
You dare to defy the King's imperial edict?
If it is the King's imperial edict
I think, nobody would defy
But a moment ago, What I heard from beginning to end
Is all your speech, Teng Bochang
Yan Shuai, what you are saying is very offensive
What we will listen is the King's word
and not yours
Before the King's demise
He handed the Fei Yan Ren sword sword to me, is to let me to hand over to.....
Your official understands
The King wanted to hand over the throne to the Princess
Officials and Yan Guo's ministers will abide to the King's edict
even loyal till death
Princess who loves the people like your own children
If you can be King
All of Yan Guo's people will be of one mind and heart
The throne is always handed down to male and not to female
Princess has the majesty sword
You dare to have any opinion?
Who knows? Maybe at the point of death, the king becomes muddled?
You dare to speak ill of the King anymore
I will kill you
Generals....
Your swords are for the enemies
Yan Guo is founded on battle
All the previous kings are all knowledgeable in the art of combat
Princess , with her precious jade body
When you become king, how would you be able to command and lead the troops to defend the homeland?
Fei-er knows her limit, and had not lead the troops to battle
But my body flows with the blood of my ancestors
I will not let my ancestors, my country and my people down
I swear, as from today I will start military training
The next enemy who encroaches on Yan Guo
I will use Fei Yan Ren sword to cut down their heads
Teng Bochang
Feudal official, here
When I am in military training,you will temporary rule the  government and country
If anyone disobeys, behead!
We obey
Yan Shuai
Can the Princes complete the military training and lead the troops to battle?
Let Yan Fei-er ascending the throne is simply a joke!!
I cannot let her ruin the dignity of Yan Guo
Why don't you stand out?
You are the one that the King chooses
How can I be the master of this Kingdom?
I understand the king's mind
But I think that only you
can hold the hearts and mind of the people
But I am afraid
You don't have to be afraid
Will you continuously help me?
I can train you into
A brave soldier
Princess! Princess!

Stand up
Remember
Yan Guo soldiers
Can be killed and not defeated
Come again!
Hu brother,are you leaving the imperial place
to the military compound?
I want to learn to battle from the king
and be a soldier in the future
To protect Yan Guo and to protect you
Hu brother treats Fei-er well
Fei-er likes you
This stone can help Fei-er to protect you
and come back safely
So late, still feeding the horses?
After feeding the horse, go back and rest
General
I have something to talk to you
This is spoken to my childhood friend Ah Hu brother only
He always bring me to ride horses when I was young
Shoot hare and catches fish
Those were my happiest days
Now when I am with him
Although I got scolded frequently and subjected to punishment
But I know
Besides the King, he is the one that treats me well
No matter what he did to me, is always helping me
I hoped to let him know
I won't disappoint him
Arrow is too slow. Arm strenght is weak
Draw arrows 1000 times
I want the princess to disappear
Not only will she be unable to ascend to the throne
Even Murong Shie-Hu will be made to admit guilt
Even gone missing from the military compound
Murong Shie-Hu deserves  what kind of punishment?
This is not the time to say who is wrong
Official Teng is right
Perhaps this matter
has nothing to do with Murong Shie-Hu
What crime has he done?
The missing incident, from the beginning
is because the Princess is incompetent and
unable to complete the military training
and if thrown into the battle, don't know what would happen.....
lets General Murong find princess as soon as possible
The truth can be known
Princess
Princess
Princess
Princess
Princess
Miss
Calm down
Who are you?
I was the one who rescued you.You have been hit by poisoned arrow
Where is this place?
This is my home
You can recuperate here in peace
I need to go back
Eh, miss
Your toxin is still present. You cannot walk
I need to go back. Goodbye
Miss
I told you that you can't walk
If you keep saying that you want to go back, I will send you
to those who wants to kill you
Have to take the medicine for 3 days
Drink quickly

Duan Lanquan
I am called Yan Fei-er
Thanks
Princess!
Princess! Princess!
Princess!
Princess!
Yan Fei-er
Here, let me apply the medicine
No!
Your wound needs to reapply the medicine everyday
Otherwise it's going to itch alot
I said no, means no!
Duan has no lustful thoughts
Last night I applied the medicine, I have to look
Don't say anymore!
Give me the medicine, I will do it myself
Hurry up
Really itchy
Hurry UP!!
Eh
Don't look
How to apply when I don't look?
Don't have to look too clearly!
Quick
Eh
Close your eyes! Don't permit you to look
How to apply when my eyes are close??
You close your eyes
Eh
What are you doing?
Don't make noise. Very quick
Turn your head away
Very quick
I don't allow you to peep
Close your eyes
Alright, it's done
Can you confirmed she was shot by the poisoned needle?
Definitely
Return to the valley and await instructions
That day in the sword hall
All officers and men all heard with their own ears
Princess pledge to complete the military training then ascend to the throne
But now
She sneaked off unexpectedly from the military compound
Then she automatically gave up the throne
We cannot speculate unnecessarily
If Yan Fei-er is really unable to fulfill the pledge
Yan Guo will choose another for the throne
Duan Lanquan
Duan Lanquan
Eat as much as you can
Can these be eaten?
Tastes really bad
Yan Fei-er
Is it delicious?
It's okay, I am not too hungry
Thanks
I just made something
I chose a good name for it. It's call "No need to ask"
You see
Give it to you
"No need to ask", of what use??
To help you to apply medicine 
then you won't have to ask me
Eh,Where are you going?
I going to see the Empress
Empress

The Empress you said is the Queen Bee
Right
This honey is very rare
He cultivates vital energy and beneficial to the body
Must be careful. Don't get stinged
This honey with my herbal concoction
would be doubly effective to your wound
Eating it everyday is also good for your health
Come! Try it!
These honey are really very delicious.
I also want to try
Good. But must be gentle and don't be anxious
MMM
Yan Fei-er, careful
Do not be anxious. Take your time
Yan Fei-er
Don't be afraid. Coming with this
Quick! Run
Come! Come and taste my cooking
OK
Is it good? Delicious
You shouldn't be a soldier,you should be a chef
What I cook is not delicous
is what you cook is really awful
Doesn't matter if it taste good or not
A person is full, is the happiest
Where are your family members?
Dead
Same here
Are you a southerner?
What is northerner or southerner?
Everybody lives on the same land
is actually one big family
In this big family, eversince we are young we live in war
Where is the peace?
Why do you become a soldier?
The country is in difficulty
Therefore everyone has the responsibility to protect it
Country is not in difficulty.The country is sick
What sickness?
War-like sickness
The big nation attack the small country.The strong bullies the weak.Small nation fight among each other
Only the common people suffer
Therefore You run to this remote mountain to become a recluse
away from the battle
War
Can only bring pain
Rest early
Rest early and the wound will heal faster
Sui-Yue knife
Is the Sui-Yue soldier still alive?
They say that ten years ago
Was extinguished by ten country collaborations?
What is the use of sewing so many cloth together?
Wait until you finish sewing, our job will be done
Then what is it?
Can you tell me?
Heavenly Lantern
Heavenly Lantern
So big?
Only with such a size that can bring us up to heaven
You are dreaming
It's only through dreams that we can make it into reality
Dream into reality?
The heavenly lantern needs huge amount of hot air to rise above
Therefore I found some herbal medicines in Outer Mongolia prairie
As long as it is concocted properly
it will turn into a strong flammable fluid
When the time comes to ride the heavenly lantern
Just light it
Whish! We can fly
If it flew too high and we fell down, what can we do?
I've never though of that
But, think about it
The sky is so blue and the clouds is so white
All these are right by your side
When you extend your hand, the sky and clouds will be in your hands
Then it will be like your name Yan Fei-er
Like a swallow flying in the sky
Don't you think it is so joyous?
When can we fly?
There is not enough time
Why?
Your wound has already healed
You can leave tomorrow
Yes, right, I must go back as soon as possible
Do you want to see the world's most beautiful sight?
What is it?
Come. It's at the top
Is this shangri-la?
This is a place
that has not been tainted by war
Let's take a look
Ha! So cute
Life is precious
We must really treasure it
Remember to apply your medicine on time
Inside , there is some honey
Morning and night application will help the wound heal faster
If the wound itches, use this, "No need to ask"
There is a map inside,so you won't be able to get lost
I will remember what you said
Early to bed, early to rise. The wound will heal faster
Rest early
Mmm
Eh! Are you asleep?
I was on the verge of sleeping but was awakened by you
What are you doing?
I going home tomorrow. I am so happy that I can't sleep
What about you?
These few days have made me tired
When you leave tomorrow, my routine will restore to normal
Live my own life
Let's get an early rest
Rests early. Early to bed , early to rise makes the wound heals faster
Everyday, he can only say the same old words
Yan Fei-er
Let me send you off,ok?
Just go straight, you will be able to go home
Promise me something
Complete the heavenly lantern as soon as possible
Then come and find me with the heavenly lantern in Yan Guo
It's my troops
Ah Hu brother
Princess , Your Highness
Princess , Your Highness. I am late in protecting you
Get up, quick
Ah Hu brother, this is Physician Duan
He is my saviour
Many thanks
Princess,let's return to the city
Good
Saddles a horse for the princess
Yes
I am not intentionally concealing my identity
But I never thought that
You are the Princess of Yan Guo
But what I hope for is
that you remember me as Yan Fei-er
One that can fly in the sky freely
like a swallow
Should go now
Remember your promise
I am only afraid I can't achieve it
Alone, flying in the sky is more than enough
Take care
If are tired, you can come down and rest
No need
Let's hurry up and be on our way
General
Your Highness, Princess
What is the matter?
Zhao Guo's army is near the border
Our army  is resisting. Many are dead and injured
Return to the city
Princess came back!Princess came back!
Princess came back! Princess came back!
The Hu tyrant coerces me to give him the King's seal
To let him ascend the throne ,only then wil he dispatch the troops into battle
I cannot bear it any longer
Therefore, I personally lead the troops to battle
Really too much!
What are the situation on both sides now?
Zhao Jun 10,000 men
Our army under general is below 2000 people
The military books have written, if the war drags on 
it would be disadvantageous to us
Hu Ba is also waiting covetously 
Then what should we do?
Let Zhao Wu know the Princess is commanding and leading the troops
His goal is certainly the princess
We will set up a trap. Let the Princess lure them in
Wouldn't the Princess be taking too much risk?
I have made a pledge in the Sword's Hall
I will personally lead the troops to fight the enemy
All of you must protect princess with all your might
If the situation changes. Retreat immediately
Yes
Father king 
The Princess is leading the troops personally
Why doesn't Murong Shie-hu leads the troop personally?
I knew their generals disagree with each other
After sunset , the world will be mine
Zhao Guo Du Zhun
Today, I, Yan Fei-er will live and die together with the troops
Won't return if we don't win
Long Live the Princess! Long Live the Princess!
Anyone who captures the Princess with will awarded 1000 taels of gold
Remember to remember to lure Zhao Guo's men into the woods
as soon as possible
No need to worry
Archer
Shield soldier
Block that side
Your several Here spheres
There is the Princess, grab her
Protect the princess
Protect the father king
Go!
Kill!!
Kill!!
Stop!!
Princess
Why don't kill him?
Father king
If you must kill, kill me
I undertake the punishment of death for attacking Zhao Guo's capital 
Please give my father a path to live
Move aside!
Father king
Come
Come!
Stab me swiftly with one stroke
In future Zhao Guo will never let you live in peace
I kill you
Can I kill all the people in Zhao Guo?
Zhao Wu ! Yan and Zhao both , have been at war for numerous years
The dead and injured are innumerous
What have we achieved?
For what purpose?
Your king Father, my King Father
and also our ancestors
All the thousands of men in the battlefield
Why do they die?
because of vengeance!
do I have any feud with your son?
Both our country should not go to war
Bring your King father away
Withdraw
Let's go
Your majesty! Your majesty!
Your majesty! Your majesty! How is it?
Withdraw the troops
Withdraw the troops! Withdraw the troops!
Withdraw the troops! 
Withdraw!
Long Live the Princess! Long Live the Princess!
Long Live the Princess! Long Live the Princess!
From the Princess imperial decree
Tie Er-pao and his officers, 13 men together
callous in their duties and responsibilities
all are demoted by 3 grades
Yan Hu Ba as the commander-in-chief
Colluded with his subordinates not to carry out military orders
and also scheming to ascend to the throne
and let the country slip into danger
the crime cannot be pardoned
As of today will be expelled from carrying out any duties
and chased out of Yan Guo's
the loser takes the fall
that is how the game is played
Yan Shuai
This is my special concoction of poison
It is extremely poisonous and no anitdote
If is not because of your last concoction which is quite useless
Yan Shaui would have ascended to the throne and be king
No way to cure?
Upas
Can you concoct the poison?
Yes! Yes! I know
Produce it en masse
The water from Taiyue Mountains have flooded many villages and small towns
The flood victims are desperate. They are snatching food and living in chaos
Despatch troops to distribute grains. Just in case
The famine victims grows larger.Urgently needs grain to stop the famine
Do we need to distribute grain to stop the famine?
Princess
Princess
Princess
Princess
Do you want to distribute the grains to stop the famine?
Okay. Distribute the grains to stop the famine
General Murong, you can delegate the troops
Teng Gong, do we have anything more to discuss?
The day after tomorrow will be autumn obeisance day
the arrangement for the grand ceremony for the Princess to ascend to the throne...
War has just ended. Natural disaster at the moment
Grand ceremony for ascending to the throne should not be extravagant
All should be simple
Okay
Okay. Everybody must be tired
Withdraw
You are just like in the past
No matter where I run to 
You are always first to find me 
I know that when you have something to think about
you will come here
When I was young, I only know that the Wang Cheng walls are very high
But did not know
that outside Wang Cheng city, the world is so big
Then you have seen it?
There are places that are higher
If we look down from the sky
everything is different
After I meet him
I actually believed that humans can fly
I don't really know
why I believed this fool's words
He is not a fool. He is a Shuo Yue warrior
Shuo Yue Warrior! I thought I heard the king said before
It's our Yan Guo and the world's taboo
Nobody is willing to mention about this group of people
They are world's most feared group of warriors
From South to north
Wherever they go, they kill
Finally, due to the collarborations of ten nations
Ten years ago, one evening
They are exterminated completely
He can escape from death
I think heavenly gods
are giving him and I a chance
Princess imperial decree
Zhu and Chen, all officials and generals
Yan Fei-er decided to give up my kinghood
Allowing Murong Shie-Hu, Teng Bochang
Together to govern Yan Guo 
Princess
Princess
From now on
Yan Fei-er will not inquire about government affairs again
God bless our country
Ah Hu brother
You are Yan Xiangtian's daugther, his blood flows in you
You must preserve his hard work
You also knew that the king have already decided
to hand over Fei Yan Ren sword to you
You are the best man for the job
This is your country and also your home
You can just chuck everything and leave?
If it needs me
I can fight for it and die for it
Isn't there anything in your heart
worth making you stay?
Certainly there is
I will forever place it in here
Goodbye Ah Hu brother
Fei-er
Be careful on your journey
Duan Lanquan
Fei-er
Bring me along. I also want to fly
Come up quickly
I will throw a rope to you
Hurry up! Catch it!
Go up another level
Wait for me
Come up quickly, loosen the rope
Swing the bridge
Quick
Fei-er
Wah! It's so beautiful..oh
I've never thought that you would come back
I have finished the honey, therefore I must come back
Where do you want to fly to?
Want the truth or lies?
It's up to you
The lie is that I am thinking of you and want to see you
Want to fly to look for you
Then the truth?
The truth is I thinking of you too much. Really want to see you
and want to look for you immediately
Fei-er
Be careful. You will catch cold
General
I just received news
The tyrant Hu Ba secretly lead some troops out of the city
It's treason
Does he want to besiege the city and rebel?
Civil war at this time, Yan Guo cannot become a nation
Princess had just abdicated
We must certainly stand firm in this situation
You see
I just found one
The purple ganoderma lucidum is good for health and vitality
In this mountain, there is plenty
Let's dig seperately and see who got the most?
Mmm I shall go that side
Good
A guest from faraway, forgive me for not receiving
You have buried this knife
But could not bury your past
Shuo Yue Warrior
I only an average person who lives here
Let's get on with it
Why must you compel me?
If you do not have the courage to draw your sword today
it is the equal to have no qualification to be with Fei-er
I did not want to use the knife again
What is your purpose in coming here?
The weapon in the hand of a man
is not used for killing
But is used for protecting the most important things in our life
Yan Guo is no longer a safe place
You bring Fei-er and get away from here
The further the better
Thanks
Qucik! Quick!
Surround them
Surround them
All of you want to revolt?
Teng Bochang's fate will be like yours
I will tear you into shreds
You can come here and try
General don't come and pester here
It is a trap
Kill them all!
Let's all kill our way out
Jigong's brothers

General take the Fei Ren sword and go
Quickly , go!
Archer

If we want to leave, we leave together!
Open the gate, let me in
With Fei Yan Ren sword in your hand
go and summom the troops
General leave quickly
General won't abandon all of you
if we must die, we die together
General, don't let us die in vain
Fei-er
There is something I want to tell you
If you don't say, I already knew
Shuo Yue's warriors and Yan Guo's grudges in the past
It's already in the past
What I care about is our future
General Murong has looked me up today
Ah Hu brother came?
He wants me to take you away
I think probably something have happened in Yan Guo
I thought I can make my dream into reality
Why don't you conceal it from me?
I rather hate myself then you hating me
For you, I can give up the throne
But I cannot let the people of Yan Guo
Live in suffering and pain
Lanquan wait for me to come back
Eh
How is your wound?
Don't worry
You forgot
Previously I have used three days
to cure you of your poison
Do not worry about me
Hury up and go to Yan Guo
General Murong is waiting for you
Quick
Wait for me to come back
I will wait
General General
General is back! General is back!
General general
General is back
Are all of you that is left?
Where are the others?
The military compound was burnt
All our brothers are dead
They sacrificed themselves in order to save me
All of you leave
From now on,
I am no more your general 
Go!
Are you courting death? Or to surrender?
Don't you want my head?
If you got the guts, come and take it!
This tactic is not effective on me.
Bring his head to me
Kill!
Murong Shie Hu
I want you to die here, today
Come!
Let me see how long your blood will flow!
Who else dares!!?
Stop! Everybody stop!
AH Hu brother! Ah Hu brother!
Qucikly go!
You are only courting death
The warrior can die but can never be defeated!
Murong Shie Hu
If you got the guts, stand up
Hu Ba
because of one man's ambition
so many had to die
You are the one who should die!
If you have the ability, come here and kill me
Today, I will make a stand with you
Fei-er! Fei-er!
You are not his match
What?
Don't even dare to avenge your father?
The king was killed by you!!! You beast!
Ah Hu brother
I will kill Hu Ba for the sake of Yan Guo
Even if I have to die
Good
Come
I will use your blood to offer as a sacrifice for my new dynasty
Fei-er
Ah Hu brother
Lanquan
You said that you will wait for me to come back
I came back
Together we will look at the highest mountain
The biggest sea
Lanquan
You get up
Bring me away
Lanquan
The world's most beautiful thing
Is the time I spent with you
Although short. But at least I did not missed it
I, Yan Fei-er
As the 16th monarch of Yan Guo 
give the title of Zhao Yan warrior to Murong Shie-Hu
From now on,Yan Guo will no more go into war
and live peacefully with the nine nations
Long Live the King! Long Live the King!
Lanquan
There will be no more war
that encroaches on every inch of this land
Very quick , everywhere is our paradise!
