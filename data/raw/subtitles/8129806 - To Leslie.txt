Big city, plenty of stuff going

I'm right around the corner.
It's here.

- Good, this your moms?
Alright.

- Nice to meet you.
- So this is it.
Um, you can sleep in my room.
That one's Darren's.
- Oh God, no, I can sleep
on the couch just fine.
- No, that's okay.
You wanna tell me what's going
on?
- Oh, can't we...
Can I hear about you first
before we start going into my

- Sure.
- You wanna go somewhere or
something?
Wanna go out?
- Um...
I'm kinda beat, I came
straight from work to get you.
- Okay, well, maybe tomorrow we
can go.
- Yeah, yeah, I'll call in sick.
- No, you don't have to
do that for me.
- They won't mind.
Are you hungry?
You want some Chinese?
- I could eat.
- You still like wonton soup?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, I'll run to the corner.
You good?
- Yeah, I'm fine, baby.
- I don't know, she hasn't
told me anything yet.
I can't smell it on her.
I won't lie, she doesn't look
good.
Yeah, I gotta go.
Grandma, she's not gonna hurt
me.
I gotta go, I love you too.
Okay, bye.
Did you find something you like?
Yeah, work is steady.
Pays decent enough most of the
time.
Darren's there too.
- You like that kinda work?
- Yeah, I like being outside.
I'm good at it.
- It's funny,
I always thought you'd be a rock
star.
- Since when?
- Well, since I bought you that
guitar.
You still play it?
- Not so much anymore.
How about these?
- No, I'll get this, I'll get
this.
- It's fine.
- I don't need my son buying me
underwear.
God, it's always such a mess in
here!
God.
Did you call your grandma?
- Yeah.
- I knew you would.
- I told her we were having a
nice day, that you were good!
- Did she tell you you're a
liar?
- So what's your plan?
- I don't know, I'll
spend some time with you.
Why? You want me to get
out of here already?
- What about going home?
- To mom and dad? Are
you out of your mind?
- No, home.
- Oh, to Dutch and Nancy.
No, they're the reason I am the
way I am.
No.
Hey, you wanna go to the zoo?
- The zoo? Those places are
terrible.
- I used to take you all time.
- Animals are meant to be in the
wild
and we put them in cages.
How'd you like it if people
stood around
watching you suffer?
- They do.
- Then don't go to zoos.
Mom! I'm so sorry.
Stop!
What are you doing?
- You on one of them dating
apps?
Picking out girls like
youse fishing with dynamite?
- I don't have time for that.
- Don't have time to
have fun?
- I'm working, trying to put
back.
- Ah, you're trying to
do what I didn't do.
Well, I'm glad I taught you
something.
- Before I leave, I wanna
go over some ground rules.
- Oh, okay.
- You can stay here as long
as you need to make a plan.
Long as you need.
But you can't live here.
You need a plan.
- Okay.
- And no drinking.
- Baby, I don't drink no more.
- We can smoke
pot, that's fine, but-
- Baby, I don't drink like I
used to.
- Okay, see you tomorrow?
- Good night.
- I'll be home around 6:00.
Just, we can take a walk or
something.
- I'll be just fine.
- Okay.
- How's it going?
- Hi! I'm Leslie, I'm James's
mama.
- Oh, I remember.
Heading out for the day?
- Well, yeah, he needs some

milk for his cereal?
Well, have a good one!
- Thank you, ma'am.

- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, life sucks.

Now,.
- Where have you been?
- Well, you're home early!
- I've been all over town
looking for you.
- I was here, baby, watching TV.
- Mom?!
- I was here and I went for a
walk
'cause I've been cooped up in
here.
So I went looking for a job.
- A job?
- Yeah.
Gonna get my plan - you
know, figure out my plan.
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?
Honey, are you okay?
- What kind of job?
- What kind?
Any kind!
Any kind.
- Were you next door?
Jesus fucking Christ!
- Baby, baby, baby!
Baby? Oh!
- Was she in here-
- Hey, man, look-
- When I was talking to you?
- We was just having a
beer.
- You were having a beer with my
mother?
- I didn't know that was
a problem.
- No? Then why'd you lie
about it?
- Because she
freaked when she heard you.
Okay, I don't know what's
going on between you two-
- Don't talk to her again!
Don't talk to her again!
- Dude, you need to calm down!
- Oh, come on!
- Come on, come on!
- Baby? Baby, baby.
Baby, please, I went out.
I was just trying to have
some fun, 'cause it's-
- You stole money from Darren.
- What?
- You stole money from Darren.
- I didn't steal.
Did he tell you that?
- Come on, lie to me
again. Lie to me again!
- I'm your mother, I would
not steal money from you.
What are you doing?
Get off of me.
- Un-fucking-believable!
- You fucking chicken shit!
Hey! Baby?
Hey, hey.
- What did I say?! No drinking!
- I'm your mother, you cannot
talk to me this way, James.
- Mother? Mother?!
- Yes, your momma
stop it.
- You're a drunk!
- I am sick.
- I'm not gonna do this again,
I'm not.
- You? What about me?
We were supposed to have a good
life.
I didn't want this for you.
- I had a good life until you
showed up.
I'm not even 20.
I can't even drink yet,
and I have to take care of my
mother?
I have to take care of you?
I made one rule, no drinking,
and you couldn't last a fucking
day!
- I'm sad.
I can't help it.
But I wanna be a good momma.
I wanna be a good momma again.
Baby, I wanna be a good momma, I
do.
I love you so much, baby.
Who are you calling?
Are you calling grandma?
You do not call my mother!
She is my mother!
You do not call my mother!
You leave her out of this!
What are you doing? Why are they
here?
- Taking you to the bus station.
- No baby.
I will not go out again, baby.
- I called Dutch.
- Dutch?
- He's gonna pick you
up when you get to town.
- Baby don't make me go back
there.
No, no.
You're just like your grandma!
Baby
I love you so much.
I love you so much.
Don't do this to me.
- I hope that fills your cup.
- Hi.
Yeah, it's just putting money
down on two different places
and never got that back.
My car got fucking stolen
and shit just piled up.
- All that time, you weren't
working?
- I was.
Well, how are you doing, Nance?
- Alright.
James told us what happened.
Stop!
Go on, go ahead.
Go ahead.
- Help yourself.
You always do.
- The only reason we agreed
to put you up is that boy,
and what you did for us.
- Don't you give her that!
- Do you want to do this?
- We put a helluva lot more to
this place
than what she gave us.
- The only reason you're here
is James.
But there will be none of
that shit you pulled on him.
This is my house, you
will follow my rules.
- Dutch, don't talk like that.
- I ain't fucking around,
Lee, I'll put you on the curb!
- Dutch, it's me.
What y'all doing tonight?
- We're having a fire.
- Would you do me favor
and you just don't tell anyone
I'm here?
- Nance already did.
You're welcome to join, but
you will be painting tomorrow,
so you might wanna think
about getting some rest.
- I'm painting?
- Yeah, yeah, to start with.
This ain't a charity, Lee.
We ain't them derelicts you spit
on,
and we ain't partying no more.
We work, when we come
home, we work some more.
So don't expect a repeat.
Ain't no one taking your shit
a second time, you got it?
- Is that you talking or
is that Nancy talking?
- You know where the
door is.
Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.
- Man, she was a fish.
- Yeah.
- You remember that?
- Yeah.
- She could drink
all of ya'll under the table.
- Hell yeah.
- She just blew all that money?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Where's she been?
- Well, why don't we ask her?
- Yeah.
- Go.
- Leslie?
- No, don't.
Pete, no, don't you call her
out!
- Leslie?
Leslie?
Leslie
I know you're in there
- That was breakfast.
- Oh my God, lower your fucking
voice!
- I don't care.
- She fucking hears that.
- I can give two fucking shits!
I hope she fucking does!
- What do you want! You want
me to knock her around for you?
Pop her in the mouth?
- No, I want her out of my
fucking house!
- Who's fucking stopping you!
- You're the one who let her in
here!
- He called me crying, he
was begging on the phone.
What the fuck was I supposed to
do
- I will not be played
for a fool, not again.
No, I will not! Don't you
walk away from me, Dutch!
Dutch, get back here you fucking
asshole.

Rise and shine!
Let's go.
Get up and get off the property,

Let's go!
This ain't no place to sleep.
That's it.
Hey man, I found this.
- Oh, yeah?
- I don't know.
- What am I gonna do with that?
- I don't know, go through
it and see what you find
and junk the rest, I guess.
- Lost and found now? Okay.
Whoa!

Come on, man.
- I heard she was back.
- Do I know her?
- She came before you left --
I mean, she left for you came.
Real sad story, real sad.
- Well heya, Lee.
Waiting for someone?
You looking for a drink?
Beer and burgers, I get,
but vodka and French fries?
Shit, how's that taste?
Yeah, I remember when
I went tits up for you.
Everyone cozying up, all that
money.
But you ain't without fault.
I ain't saying nothing you don't
know.
I'm on disability now, that's
new.
- You look fine to me.
- I look fine?
- I mean, not broken.
Mm-hmm
Hey, what are you doing, Pete?
What are you doing?
Ow. Ow!
Dammit.
- Oh, shit, man.
That lady's back looking for her
bag.
You bring it out there, she
gonna know you went through it.
Better let her be, man.
Just let her be.
- Shit.
Hey, hey, lady.
- What?
- You're just not gonna quit,
are ya?
The reason I'm not returning
your calls is because-
- What?
- Shit.
- I didn't steal nothing.
- I know. I know.
I got your calls.
I didn't return them,
but the job is yours if
you want it, alright?
Pays 10 an hour.
You know what? Make it seven.
Seven an hour, room and board.
The job is yours if you want it,
okay?
It's easy work, $7 an hour.
All you got to do is
maintain the property,
run some errands, room and
board.
Did you wanna say something?
- You're offering me a job?
- Yeah, the one you've been
calling about.
- I was calling?
- I thought so.
- Okay.
- Okay. Shit.
- Why do you keep cussing?
- Just meet me over at
the office in an hour
and I'll get you set up.
- Did you just offer her a job?
- I don't know what's wrong with
me, man.
- Look, you better go back
out there and tell her no.
- You go tell her!
- Dammit, Sweeney!
Where's she gonna sleep?
- In my room.
- Where are you gonna sleep?
- In your room?
- And where am I fitting to
sleep?
- Right in here.
Now, you got your basic cable.
You got Wi-Fi, most days you got
Wi-Fi.
- I think this is yours.
- Oh, I'm sorry, it is mine,
yeah.
- Oh..
So what have I got to do for all
this?
- Oh, well, nothing! I mean-
- I gotta work, don't I?
- Oh, right, yeah.
Yeah, you gotta work.
Basically, you got to clean up
the rooms
after the guests leave and wash
the towels, wash the sheets,
maintain the property a little
bit
and help guests with their bags.
- That it?
- That is it, really,
pretty much it, right.
- Okay.
- And nothing
tonight, we'll start tomorrow.
- Okay!
- Okay.
Royal, the other one of us,
we're about to have supper,
if you wanna join us,
you're more than welcome.
- Thank you.
I think I'm gonna settle in.
- Right, of course, I'll leave
you to it.
- Alright. Hey?
- Yeah.
- When do I get paid?
- Right, of course,
that's pretty important.
End of the week.
But if you needed an
advance, I could probably...
- It would help.
- Right, okay.
Not a problem.
How's 50? Is that...
- No, God.
Thank you!
- Okay, alright. So, great.
Well, good night then.
- Good night, I'll see you
tomorrow.
- Yes, you will, you will.
Sleep well. Yeah, good night.
- Damn clock didn't go off.
- Hey, look, it's okay.
You didn't know, I didn't tell
you,
but we start at 8:00 AM around
here.
- Good to know.
- Alright. You know what?
Let me get you a key so you
can get into the other rooms.
Oh, come on, come on.
- Thank you.
- Why don't you take that.
- Thank you.
Hi, Royal! You remember me?
I do.
- How you doing?
Okay.
Well, I'll get to it.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- If you need anything, let me
know.
- Sure.
- Hey, Royal, you seen a
pink suitcase about so big?
Hey, she'll get
the hang of it, man.
- Cleaning the room.
Real mountain to climb.
- A good way is to use your
finger, okay?
And if there's guck on it,
then you need to do it again.
I mean, I don't wanna
be a hard-ass, Leslie-
- No.
- But clean is clean.
- Yeah, yeah,
I guess I'm just getting used to
how things work around here.
- Yeah, we do it right
the first time around.
- Okay, yes, sir.
- Okay, alright then.
Well, good night.
- Hey, hey, hey, can I...
Could I have the other
half of that advance
that you gave me?
'Cause I spent the first
half on groceries, and I
was thinking it'd be so nice
to have some flowers for the
room.
- Uh huh.
There you go.
- Thank you.
- Alright.
- Where's Dutch, Nance?
What, you got the balls to
throw me out you fucking house,
but you can't look at me?
- Little girl, you need to look
around.
- Little girl?
You fucking wish.
You don't gotta worry about me
because despite your best
effort, I ain't going nowhere.
I got me a job.
I got a place to stay,
so you better watch out.
Bang, bang.
- Y'all remember, Leslie, don't
you?
Helen and Raymond's little girl?
- That's right, our lucky lotto
winner!
- You remember the Brickmans?
Mr. and Mrs. Brickman and Warren
Parnell.
He used to play Sunday Oregon.
I'm sure they'd love to hear
what's going on in your life.
Why don't you pull up a seat?
- How are you?
You disappeared on us.
- Me? I'm fine.
- And your folks? I do miss
them.
- Yeah, they're well.
They're down in Florida.
- Next time you speak to 'em,
tell 'em I'm thinking of 'em.
- Oh, I will.
- You know, Leslie,
we still pray for you.
No matter what's been done,
the church is still here for
you.
I hope you know that.
- Well, sorry for the
interruption.
And I hope you all have a
good night and God bless.
And ya know,
I'm just gonna be over
here enjoying myself,
if you get tired of ole saddle
bags here.
- See you around, Lee.
- Yeah, you will.
- I apologize.

Hey, buddy.
What are you doing up and out of
bed?
I used to live here.
Yeah
- Can I help you?
Do I need to walk you out?
- No, no.
God, this was a good house.
I used to cook and clean.
I used to cook and clean.
And Christmas, we used to have
a just wonderful Christmas.
We used to put the tree
there in that corner.
Is that where you put your tree?
- Is there somebody that
you need me to call?
- No.
- Ma'am, is there somebody
that you need me to call?
- Hey, Leslie.
Listen, I'm sorry it didn't work
out.
You can just take what I gave
you for the time you put in.
Leslie?
- I don't think she in there.
- Hey, Leslie, I need to talk to
you.
Come on.
- I'm sorry.
I haven't been myself late-.
for a long time
And this is a good job, I
understand that.
And I messed up, I'm sorry.
- If you got people,
I can take you to 'em.
- If I had,
I'da called 'em last night.
- I might look stupid to you
but-
- You don't.
- Yeah, well, I ain't one for
letting people get over on me.
- You could've fooled me there.
Look, it might not be obvious to
you,
but I'm asking to stay.
- When you finish that,
go check in with Royal.
There's some crap behind
16, he needs help sorting.
- Royal. We like to keep him
around.
Something for the kids to
poke a stick at.
How long you been drinking?
Okay, mind my business?
Sure thing.
Royal, that's not even the
weirdest thing he does.
You'll see in time.
You'll see for yourself.
He'll get butt-naked and run
that field
just screaming like a damn wild
man.
It's crazy, man!
He'll just go, just running
naked, crazy!
You wait till you'll see it.
Oh, man, the cops don't even
bother with him anymore.
He does it so damn much.
Crazy son of a bitch.
You know...
quitting cold turkey, it's a
good way to shock your system.
- Well, I don't got a choice.
- Someone making you quit?
Alright, well, you don't
seem like you wanna talk
and that's okay,
but we're trying to eat dinner
here
and I don't wanna listen to
that.
So is there some music
you'd like me to put on?
- You can pick.
- Okay, why don't we just play
whatever Royal's got on there?
Just let ol'

- Hey, do you need
anything?
I can bring you something to
eat.
Something to throw up.
I'll give you time,
but three and four need to be
turned
and the sheets need folding.
- Can't you give me a fucking
break?
- Hey, don't be
yelling at me.
Three and four.
- Three and four.
- Oh, alright, alright, alright.
- I folded all them sheets.
- I'm a one man parade.
- What is that?
- I got Salisbury steak
with mashed potatoes
and roast turkey breast and
stuffing.
What would you like to eat?
- I'll have a Salisbury steak.
- Yes, ma'am. How
would you like that cooked?
How about just hot?
- Thank you.
- So did you want me to stay
here again?
Okay.
- Did you eat something?
- I did, thank you.
- Ya know?
I think you'd better leave.
- Oh, come on, I been
hearing you all week.
- It's the other end.
- Oh, geez, alright.
Well, if you need anything, let
me know.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Go away or I'll call the
police.
- How's your tummy?
- You know, I don't really
wanna talk about that with you.
But thank you for the pills.
- That was Royal's idea.
- Well, I'll thank him tomorrow.
Couldn't sleep, huh?
- Nope, and I wanted to tell you
that you're doing good work.
The place looks real clean
and the guests are real happy.
- Thank the Lord, I did it. I'm
a maid.
- Yeah, so when Royal's daddy
died
and left him the place, I
was already staying here.
So he asked me if I would help
him run it.
- Wait, this is Royal's motel?
- It is.
Didn't you grow up together?
- Damn, we ain't run in the same
circles.
- Well, that's probably better
off,
'cause somehow he did so much
LSD
that it permanently rewired his
brain.
I'm serious.
I mean, he can function, but
man,
you ask him to remember to pay a
bill?
So, I get a room and a small
wage.
- And what'd you do before this?
- I never did much.
I worked the oil field and got
divorced.
So run a motel?
Sure, I'll do it.
- And that picture you
keep, is that your ex-wife?
- No, that is my daughter,
Bernice and her baby.
- Did you leave them?
- No, I left my wife.
I see them as much as possible.
They live about an hour away
from here.
- Just didn't work out, huh?
- Well, she drank.
And she beat the drinking.
And the church that helped
her, I did not care for.
And she liked the church
and like the pastor more.
- No.
- Yes.
Preacher stole my wife.
- That's a gold record right
there.
- You think Willie would sing
it?
- I think he sang about it.
- Yeah, I think he did.
- And your girl?
- A good kid.
Had troubles with men, like
y'all do,
but she turned out good, though.
Hey, I didn't mean nothing
by saying her drinking led to
our divorce.
It did, but she ain't you
and things don't go the
same way for any two people.
And I don't think any less of
you
for having the problems you do.
So, hey, I wanted to ask you
if you wanted to join
me and Royal at a dance.
- Now you don't wanna ask me no
more?
- No, I am, I'm asking
you, but it's a town thing.
It's-
- A town thing?
- Yeah, right.
Meaning, everyone will be there.
The whole town and...
- Oh,
Yeah, no thank you.
- I'm just saying that it's your
home too.
And if you're planning on doing
something
other than eating TV dinners
with me and the space cadet,
maybe you oughta venture out a
bit.
That's all I'm thinking.
- Paw-paw!
- Oh, who's that yelling at me?
Hey, Betsey-girl, how you doing?
- Mom said we can play games.
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, how you doing? Is your
mom coming?
- No, it's Sunday.
Lord forbid she have some
fun with her granddaughter.
- That's okay, more for me!
- I told Betsey
you'd play games with her.
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.
- Well, good.
Hey Bernice, this is Leslie.
Royal hired her on at the hotel,
to host.
Leslie, this is my daughter,
Bernice,
and this little dream
here, this is Betsey.
- Hi.
- Hi!
Well, pleasure to know you both.
- It's nice to meet you.
- Wanna get cracking?
- Yeah.
- Alright, let's go.
- Are you from around here?
- Yep, born and raised.
And what about you?
- We're just outside of Abilene.
- Ah, yeah, it's nice.
- Not too bad.
- Yeah, I'm winning.
I'm winning.
- I'm winning.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.
- Man.
- It's nice.
- Your girls are great.
- I did alright, huh?
- Yes, you did.
- You cheated.
- Yeah, they are cheaters.
- Hey, I didn't cheat.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Let's go to the next game.
What is this?
- Hey, Betsey, look what Leslie
got ya.
- Can you catch?
- Yeah.
- Can you catch?
- Oh!
- What was that?
- Shit!
- What was that?
- Here you go.
- Thanks there, Dutch.
- Sweeney, how are ya?
- Just hanging out with my
girls. And you?
- Can't complain.

Not everything's about you.

- Oh, you got jokes, huh?
You blew 180,000, you dumb
bitch.
- 190, and it ain't that much.
And what about you, Pete?
When I first met you, you were
fucking 18.
You were ready to see the world.
Look at you now.
You could've did anything,
Pete, but you fucking did this.
So don't give me your shit.
- Hey, hey, why don't we all
just go back
to having a good time?
Huh? Come on.
- You know what she did,
Sweeney?
- It's not my business,
it's not yours to be doing this
here.
I mean, have some sense,
alright?
I mean, we're having fun.
- You oughta know if you're
gonna be laying down with her.
- Where's Dutch?
Someone needs to take her home.
- You know she left her kid?
- He don't know anything.
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey, no, no,
don't get mad at Royal.
He's just trying to help you
out.
Did she tell you she
drank all that money away?
Had every chance, pissed
it down the gutter,
and her son-
- Nancy.
- Left him, no note, nothing.
That boy was 13.
Ain't have food, he's just
scared.
He's all alone without his mama.
Just so you could go out
drinking,
thinking you're hot shit.
- That ain't fucking true.
- Good Christian people raised
you right.
And you ruined that sweet boy's
life.
- And what did you do to fucking
stop me?!
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Get her outta here. Bitch.
- Hey, hey, was all that true?
- So what? You wanna fire me?
- Leslie.
- I don't blame you.
It's fine. You tried.
- Just stop.
- I don't blame anyone.
- Just stop.
- Why?
I was happy to have a break.
Okay, I partied and I
didn't mean to spend it all.
I lost everything and I
had to file for bankruptcy.
- Okay.
- Fucking everyone hated me.
I lost my place.
And so yeah, I left him.
- Okay.
- I left him.
- Okay, let me just say
bye and I'll drive you.
Yeah.
- Hey, it's fine.
- Just, I don't think you
should be alone, Leslie.
- What's that?
- Do you mind if I lift your
spirits?
Got a buddy who works down at
the station,
and he dug this up for me.
- And it was
here at Obe's honky ton-
- Look at you.
- That a single mother
picked the winning numbers
which after taxes, will
be sending her home
with a life-changing sum of
money.
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!
- Leslie, how does it feel?
- Well, I feel helluvalot
better than yesterday.
- I understand that you had a
little help
picking the winning numbers?
- I picked the same ones I
always do.
- And that
was your son's birthday?
- Yeah, James, my son James.
You wanna meet him?
- Sure.
- Okay.
James! Come here.
This is my boy.
Yeah, he's twice as lucky, half
as cute.
- And what do you plan
to do
with 190,000 smackeroos?
- God, I don't know.
Maybe by a house, buy
something nice for my boy.
Just have a better life!
- Hey, Lee, what about
us?
- What about us?
- Drinks are on me!
- And you James,
is there something special
that momma owes you now?
- What? Being born ain't enough?
- A guitar, so I can be the next
Waylon.
- Oh, yeah.
- And I want her to open a
diner.
She always wanted a diner.
- Hey, well, would you call it
Leslie's?
Well, I hope to be there on
opening day.
- Well, we're looking
forward to ya.
- Alright, well, from all
of us at Channel 10 News;
here's to Leslie!
We wish you all the best.
- Oh, I'm gonna watch that
again, you look so good!
- No, no.
- Just gonna rewind it.
- I said I don't wanna
watch it again, goddammit.
I said no, if you just
listened the first time,
then you wouldn't get your
feelings hurt.
- I just thought it'd be nice
to...
- Get out.
- Hey, come on, I just
thought it'd be nice
if we watch it together just to
remind you
that you're not the piece of
shit
that everybody says you are.
Right, what I saw was a
good mama loving on her boy,
but I guess I wasn't thinking.
- No, you weren't thinking.
You're shoving your way into
my life and you know what?
It's my life.
Jesus Christ, this fucking week!
- Well, I'm sorry I got
the fucking tape thing.
- Don't you fucking swear at me!
He --
He ain't never gonna speak to me
again.
My folks don't wanna fucking
speak to me,
and everyone in town tries
to avoid me like the plague,
and my boy doesn't wanna see me.
And I'm fucking stuck
here with you and Royal,
pair of fucking hilljacks
like the shit icing
on my shit fucking life.
Ya know?
- Me and Royal are the best
thing that happened to you.
So don't call us names.
And your family won't talk to
you
because they shouldn't after
what you did.
But you're living, right?
I'm sorry it ain't a fairy tale.
We all should have done
things differently.
But you're what's wrong with
your life, not anyone else.
- Fuck you.
- Okay
Alright, just sit down, Leslie.
Fuck you.
Come on, let's just talk about
it.
Where are you gonna go?
What are you gonna do?
I know where you're gonna go.
And everything you did to get
better
is just gonna be gone.
- Well, it ain't you're concern.
'Cause I fucking quit!
- Hello, no one is
available
to take your call at this time.
Please leave a message after the
tone.
- James, it's me.
I'm so sorry for what I did to
you.
I love you so much, and uh...
I love you sweetie.
How much?
- Seven, but for
you we'll say seven.
- I think drinking alone's a
mortal sin.
We toasting to something?
- Nothing good.
You are gorgeous.
- I'll drink to that.
- Go ahead.
Why did you come and talk to me?
- What do you mean?
- Did you see something in me
you like?
- I do. Me, in about an hour.
- Oh, that's good.
- If you ain't interested,
you just say so, lady.
- Come on, tell me.
Did you see something special in
me?
Or did you see a sure thing?
- I think you're...
I think I'm waiting on someone
else.
- Lots of fun until I got
something on my mind, huh?
- I guess, I can talk to you if
you want.
- Oh, I bet you can talk real
good.
I bet you can tell me how
beautiful I am.
- If you want.
- Tell me I'm good.
Tell me I ain't a piece of shit.
- You ain't.
You're good.
- You got a car, mister?
- Well, where did she go?
- How the hell I know, Sweeney?
- Goddammit!
- Sweeney, how are you?
- Get out of my way.
- If you're looking for
Lee, this is the place.
- What is wrong with you, woman?
- You ain't gonna change her.
- Just get out of my way, Pete.
- Why don't you get out of my
way?
- Watch it, boy.
- This boy'll whoop your ass.
- Hit him!
- Goddammit!
- Hit him, Pete. Hit him.
- Damn it, get!
Shit! I'll kill him!
- You ain't gonna do
shit, you little pissant.
Sit down and shut up.
- Fuck you!
Fuck all y'all, I was
standing up for y'all
- Guess what y'all? Next round's
on Pete!
- Yeah, drink your Coors
Light on me, assholes!
- Hey Bert,
if she ain't coming back,
you mind if I give these
lovely children a home?
Goddamn it, woman!
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
- Well, I don't even know
what you think you're doing
because there's no conversation
between us
till you start apologizing.
- I want the ice cream shop.
- What? That?
Mmhmm
- I spent too much of my life
hiding with people I don't even
know.
And I'm done with hiding
and I'm sure as shit
done with being run off.
- So you're gonna live in there?
- I'm gonna make something out
of it and you're gonna help!
- Why are you yelling at me?
- Because I'm excited! Get me a
hammer!
- Wait, you think you can
just tell me what to do
after you called me names-
- Get me a hammer.
- Okay.
- Watch out!
- Oh, watch out for
nails.
- Alright, this is it.
- You need help?
- No, I got it.
You know this is Royal's
daddy's, right?
- Yeah.
- He thought it'd
be a real hit with the
kids, but didn't work out.
Now it's just been sitting
here, like, 40 years
just waiting for someone to give
it shot.
- Yeah, like a tetanus
shot or a hepatitis shot.
Look, I saw that video and I
know you're excited about this,
but I mean, what do you know
about running a place like this?
- Well, what'd you know
about running a motel?
- No, I'm serious, alright?
I mean, unless you're hiding
some
other jackpot somewhere,
I mean, you gotta get a
fryer, you gotta get a grill.
That's expensive.
And then you gotta hire a
cook and you gotta make menus,
you gotta get a soda
machine, you gotta get-
- Hey, that's very good,
do you wanna work here?
- All right. I mean, I
understand that you're excited,
but honestly, how are you
planning on paying for this?
I mean, you can't ask us
for a raise 'cause we can't,
we don't have it.
What?
- I'm gonna move in with you.
I can save.
I can work on weekends.
Hey, it might take 10
years, but let's do it.
- Okay.
- Yeah?
- Well, I mean, I gotta ask
Royal.
- But you gonna ask him?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll ask him.
- Damn
Why are you so good to me?
- Well
I think it's pretty obvious by
now.
Okay.
So we got work to do?
- Later.
- Okay.
Alright, floors are lookin'
good.
- I don't know, I think
we should mop em again.
- Oh, you're stalling.
Royal, we're doing this!
- I'm shakin' like a goddamn
leaf.
- Still think we shoulda
called the place "Royal's."
Put on some costumes, do it up
big.
- I ain't dressing up
like a goddamn princess.
- I know, a couple of
knights and a bridge troll.
I like it.
- People like themes.
- I said no, okay? Shut up.
- Here we go.
- Order up!
- Here we go.
- Well, it's pretty quiet.
- We've been open a minute,
not even.
Fuck 'em.
- Well, I don't know why
I'm doing this, anyway.
Why it even matters.
- They're just being mean.
They'll have to eat.
They'll come, they'll see.
- I need a cigarette.
We're closing up!
What the...
- Oh, here we go, it's about
time.
Royal, we got one.
- Well, tell 'em we're
closed.
- Lee, it's a customer.
- No, they've had all day, I'm
going home.
- Hey, Lee.
- What?
- Maybe you oughta slip out the
back.
I'll take care of it.
- You go to the back.
- No, I got it, it's fine.
- Go on.
- No, I got it.
Go on.
- Okay.
- Take this.
Welcome to Lee's, how can I help
you?
- Two please.
- Just right here.
- What's wrong with a table?
- Well, that's reserved. For
members.
So will Dutch be joining you
tonight?
- No.
- Okay.
Well, I'll just get a menu for
you then
I'll just...
You're a little late,
so you wanna be quick
before we close the grill.
- Lee, you wanna pull
it back just a little?
- You did it, Nance.
No one came.
Congratulations, you
sure fucking showed me.
- Little girl-
- I mean, Jesus fucking Christ,
couldn't you done this like a
year ago?
You watched me do all this
knowing you're gonna take it
away from me.
We was family.
How fucking mean are you?
- I'm sorry for what happened.
Do you hear me? I'm sorry.
And you were right, I
could have stopped you.
I saw what was happening,
I could have stopped it and I
didn't.
'Cause I was having fun.
But for all the nights you
made me hold that little boy,
all the times you made a liar
out of me
when I was the only one telling
him,
"Don't you listen to them
people.
I know your mama.
She loves you too much
to do you like this."
You shouldn't have left.
I don't care how bad you fucked
