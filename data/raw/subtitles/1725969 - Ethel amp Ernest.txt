There was nothing extraordinary about my mum and dad,
nothing dramatic.
No divorce or anything,
but they were my parents
and I wanted to remember them by doing a picture book.
It's a bit odd, really, having a book about my parents up there
in the bestseller list among all the football heroes and cook books.
They'd be proud of that, I suppose.
But probably rather embarrassed too.
I imagine they would say, "It wasn't like that."
Or, "How can you talk about that?"
Well, I have.
And this is their story.

Social security from the cradle to the grave.
The welfare state.
It's what the workers have always fought for. We've won!
- It will have to be paid for. 
- Course it will.
We all chip in, that's the whole idea.
You can't chip in if you're out of work, or off sick, or on a pension.
No, well...
Course not. It's all got to be worked out.
It's economics, see? Economics will see to it.
There.
All done.

The Chief Inspector said he was a very clever boy.
Hmm.

We'll own all the coal soon. They're going to nationalise it.
I bet we still have to pay for it.
Of course we'll have to pay for it, you daft ha'p'orth.
So we won't own it then, will we?
Well, er, not exactly, but it means the profits will go
to the government instead of lining the pockets of the bosses.
- And then the government gives the money to us?
- No.
So what's the difference, then?

I could get an electric thermostat for the tank.
Hot water in the summertime, all modern.
Electric thermostat, electric fridge, electric milk float.
My old mum and dad never knew the meaning of the word.
- What word, duck?
- Electric!
At home, there was nothing electric in the whole blessed house.
We all grew up all right.
Two of you died as children, dear.
What's that got to do with electric?
Well, it's progress, Ette. Scientific.
It's scientific progress.
Blimey, what's this?
Meat ration to be cut by tuppence.
That's the lowest it's ever been and six years after the end of the war!
We had more meat under Mr Churchill.
Yeah, all right.

I just want him to get married in a church!
It's so much nicer.
And when are you going to start a family, dear?
Well, I don't know, really, Mum.

Never mind, Mum.

"Dump"?!
Mum, the Government has designated this
