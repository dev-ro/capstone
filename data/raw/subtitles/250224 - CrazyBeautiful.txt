Nicole didn愒 think
it was relevant.
Actually,
l think l did write to you.
Oh? What悲 l say?
No word yet, sir.
Well, l惴 sorry about that.
Maria probably hasn愒 gotten

COURTNEY: Tom? Morgan wants

And we can愒 stay.
TOM:

And what about you?
"Yes, sir. No, sir."
What is that?
You don愒 have to do that

CARLOS:
I was raised to do that.
lt愀 not some act.
Fine.
Why didn愒 you tell me
who your father was?
l don愒 go around advertising
my father愀 profession.
l didn愒 think it mattered.
-lt does matter.
-Why?
Do you know how hard it is
to get these guys...
to sit down
and read your letter?
Or pick you out of a hundred
guys exactly like you?
Well, mission accomplished.
You got your meeting...

She was intoxicated
and combative.
We found drug paraphernalia...
and alcoholic beverage
containers in the vehicle.
TOM: Christ.
We thought we悲 give you
the courtesy...
of dealing with her yourself.
Now, we could put
a scare into her...
and let her
spend the night in jail.
No. Thank you, Officer.
l can handle this.
No, you can愒 handle it!
Nicole, just calm down.
-Calm down?
-Everything will be all right.
No, it愀 not gonna be
all right!
Look at you.
What are you doing--
COURTNEY:
What is the matter out here?
Go back into the house.
ls she drunk again?
Courtney, look,
l am taking care of this.
How many times do we have
to put up with her behavior?
When is itgonna be enough,
for God愀 sake?!
When?
(Courtney sighs)
Look at you, NicoIe.
Just Iook at you.
What kind of a daughter are you?
(Sniffles)
Not yours.
Thank God for that.
This is--
Carlos, please,
what did l tell you?
TOM: Just go away.
Please. Just leave.
Go.
TOM: You hearme?
Why do you hate me so much?
(Sighs)
How could you tell
the one person in the world...
that l love,
that l care about so much...
how could you tell him
to stay away from me?
Do you think the only thing
l惻l do to anyone...
is screw them up?
Do you think
that l惴 not worth loving?
(Crying)
-Nicole--
-Carlos, this is our problem.
lt愀 our problem, not yours.
Just leave. Go.
(Nicole crying)
OFFlCER:
Come on, son, let愀 go.
Honey, listen,
come on to the house--
Leave me alone!
Just leave me alone.
Just come in the house, Nicole.
No.
Just get in the house.
TOM: Jesus Christ.
(Crying)
MANSINGING:

TEACHER: Can IheIp you?

CARLOS:

(Sniffles) Oh.

in lovely Escalante, Utah...
and l get to be escorted
by a lovely gentleman...
who愀 waiting for me

So it looks like l get to go
to boot camp before you do.
Sorry for being so dramatic
the other night.
lt was stupid.
l惴 sorry for not--
Don愒 say anything.
You couldn愒 do anything.
You were smart
not to say anything.
(Sighs)
So, Mr. Nunez...
it was great knowing you.
l hope you have
a wonderful life.
Let愀 leave.
What?
Let愀 get out of here
right now.
Aren愒 you
in the middle of an exam?
Like right now?
So?
l惴 not gonna let you
walk out of your mid-term.
l already did.
Annapolis is gonna
look at these grades.
You愉e not listening to me.
l wanna be with you.
l don愒 give a shit about
anything else right now.
Mid-terms, grades,
Annapolis, your father.
l want to be with you.
Do you want to be with me?
l love you.
Don愒 just say that because--
Shut up.
l love you, OK?
(Gasps)
You know,
this guy in the office...
he愀 pretty damn big.
Ha ha!
Then...
let愀 go out on Sunset.
Oh. Ha ha ha!
-Come on!
-l惴 coming!
MANSINGING: Iimagine
Iong waIks down the road
(Nicole laughing)
Things begin to bIoom
and the sky expIodes
The damage is undone
Then Iknow
This has got to be a dream
Machines and Iuxuries

Here.
You can wear this.
And I woke up haif-dead
in the hourgIass
Now,
does that sound funny
Wait, you愉e aImost there

You愉e aImost there,

You愉e aImost

(Plane flying overhead)
What are you doing?
You惻l see.
CARLOS: That愀 pretty cooI.
My shrine to Carlos.
(Laughs)
CARLOS:
Can Isee more ofit?
NICOLE: Yeah, sure.
(Car horn honks)
(Nicole sighs)
My suicide notes.
Creative, huh?
(Deep breath)
CARLOS:
That愀 yourmother, isn愒 it?
NICOLE: Yeah.
She...
she was in bed asleep,
l thought...
so l went downstairs...
and l stayed real quiet
all afternoon...
so l wouldn愒 disturb her.
And then I went back up...
and she was still lying there.
My dad thinks
we愉e the same person.
Did he say that?
He doesn愒 need to.
What else am l supposed
to think...
except l惴 gonna end up
like her?
lt愀 genetics, right?
(Sighs)
Your father, though...
he really loves you.
He does.
No, he doesn愒.
Nicole, listen to me.
He really loves you.
He just doesn愒 know
how to handle you.
l think you scare him.
Iscare him ?
You do. l mean,
you scare me sometimes.
-l scare you?
-Yes.
l mean, you...
Howdo Iscare you?
You just get out of control.
-l do not.
-Yes, you do.
What are you talking about?
You know what
l惴 talking about.
l惴 17. l惴 supposed
to get out of control.
l guess.
My dad, he doesn愒
understand me or...
anything about me.
Have you tried talking to him?
Yeah.
-Sober?
-Shut up.
CARLOS:
Doesn愒 happen, does it?
NlCOLE:
l惴 not always drunk.
(Crickets chirping)
(Door opens)
CARLOS: Hey.
What are you doing out here?
l want to be good for you.
You are good for me.
Not if l keep taking you away...
from everything
you扉e worked so hard for.
l want to make things
better for once...
not worse.
媒ause l really
want to be with you.
l can愒 keep running
away from things.
l惴 here for you.
l know you are.
(Woman singing)
Well, do you have
a 310 listing for J. Foster?
OPERA TOR: No Iisting, sir.
Well, try B. Foster at 818.
F-o-s-t-e-r. (Sighs)
OPERA TOR: No, sir.
There愀 no Fosterin 818.
OPERA TOR:
ShouId Itry the 310 again?
Sir? I惴 trying
to heIp you, sir.
HeIIo?
(Sighs)
Well, l扉e been up all night.
Trying to call everybody.
l called Maddy and Lainie
and your friend Foster...
who apparently doesn愒
believe in telephones.
(Sighs)
Honey, l know you don愒 want
to go to this school...
but it愀 supposed
to be extraordinary.
Marty Sheen says it愀 top-notch.
Dad, l惻l--
You惻l have your own horse.
My own horse?
Well, you like horses,
don愒 you?
When l was eight.
Well, the counselor
said that--
he warned me you would try
to talk your way out of it.
He said there愀 a danger of us
getting drawn back...
into old patterns
and destructive behavior...
and that we should spend
our time focusing on...
conversations that focus on
"We" versus "Me."
This is "We."
Oh. Well, good.
Good.
l惻l go wherever
you want me to go.
l mean,
l know l惴 a mess.
TOM: No, you愉e not a mess.
NlCOLE:
No, l am. l am a mess.
And l悲 probably
send me away, too.
(Sighs)
NICOLE:
You扉e gotMorgan now...
and you愉e gonna do it
right this time.
l just wish
l wasn愒 the child...
that everybody learned
what not to do from.
That愀 not who you are.
l know l remind you of Mom.
Everything that went wrong...
but sometimes you look at me
like you wish l wasn愒 there.
Like you wish
l悲 just disappear.
And it just hurts so bad.
l know l惴 not easy to love...
but could you try anyway?
TOM: l do love you.
l love you so much.
(Crying)
l惴 frightened for you
every minute.
Every minute.
And l need help.
l can愒 do it alone.
COURTNEY: Tom, honey?
Morgan愀 got herswim cIass.
it starts in 10 minutes.
What愀 going on?
That愀 what we愉e trying
to figure out here.
COURTNEY:
What do you mean figure out?
Didn愒 we agree on
a plan of action?
Rosa? Would you please
put Morgan in the car?
Thank you.
Yes, right now.
Oh, my God.
This is not gonna start up
all over again.
She needs discipline.
Children need limits.
They want limits!
-So we惻l set them.
-We already have!
She愀 going to that school
in Utah.
No. l am not the bad guy.
This is not about me.
l have a child
that l惴 thinking of.
So do l. Two children.
COURTNEY: Oh, Nic...
Nicole, l just don愒 think
l can live with you.
l know l can愒 live without her.
We have to be at Pepperdine
in ten minutes, Tom.
l惴 talking to my daughter.
lt愀 Morgan愀
very first swim class.
l惴 talking to my daughter.
Nicole,
l just want Morgan...
to have an older sister
that she can look up to.
Me, too.
COURTNEY: That愀 aII right.
I扉e got hernow.
NlCOLE: She愀 not like Mom.
TOM: (Chuckles) No.
God, your mom
was an amazing woman.
She loved you very much.
l wish l remembered her better.
TOM: Hmm.
(Sighs)
We should talk about her more.
We will, honey. We will.
Before you say anything, sir...
l just want you to know
that l love your daughter, sir.
TOM: You don愒 have to--
She has so much beauty,
so much honesty...
and l love her so much.
Carlos, stop.
Now, l have something to say.
Thank you.
For what?
For not listening to me.
For sticking around.
Annapolis is gonna be
lucky to get you.
CARLOS: But l had a speech.
l had a pretty good speech.
l bet you did.
You want to hear it anyways?
Why don愒 you tell it to her?
Seems to be doing pretty good.
How did that happen?
How did you do that?
Do what?
l wasn愒 even there.
NlCOLE: Yes, you were.
You were so there.
