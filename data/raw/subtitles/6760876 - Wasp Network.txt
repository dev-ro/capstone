Irma will sleep at my mom's
so we can go to the movies.
- Oh, okay.
- Don't be late.
Don't worry, I'll be there at six.
Okay.
- Not hungry?
- I'm running late.
Give Daddy a hug.
Her braid.
- Big kiss for Mommy.
- Here, Mommy.
- Love you.
- Me too.
Have a good day.
Wish Daddy a good day.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Go.
Coming to lunch?
Meet you there.
Are you Olga Salanueva,
René González's wife?
Did something happen?
We're from the Ministry of the Interior.
He had an accident? Is he alive?
He's alive, not hurt.
Comrade Salanueva,
your husband is in Florida.
He defected.
He stole a plane,
flew under our radar,
landed at a U.S. airbase in Miami.
Had you been planning this
for some time, sir?
The escape took me
three months to prepare.
To... to plan.
But I had already said goodbye to Cuba
many years ago.
Why did you defect?
In Cuba, everything's short.
Electricity. Food.
Everything.
Potato, rice, even sugar
is rationed.
Every drop of fuel for our airplanes
is counted.
I'm a pilot.
I don't want to go on living like that.
Does it mean
you will be applying for political asylum?
I don't need to.
I was born in Chicago.
So I'm an American citizen
and I'm very proud of it.
If you receive
the slightest information,
it is your duty
to inform us immediately.
You can count on it.
Hello.
Roberto,
you heard about your brother?
Listen...
I need your help
getting through this.
I'll come over later.
I'll tell our parents first.
Okay.
Then we'll tell Irma.
It'll be hard for her to understand
why he abandoned her.
But I'll be there with you. Okay?
I'll help you.
René, your new home.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Rent is paid. Three months
should give you time to get settled.
It's basic, but don't worry.
We'll help you get more stuff.
Who should I thank?
The CANF.
Cuban American National Foundation.
Jorge Mas Canosa.
Our president.
He will rebuild Cuba.
Anything you need
for your work, your family,
ask him.
You start tomorrow,
Opa-locka airport.
As a flight instructor.
Pay's not great,
but you can earn extra on the side.
So you think I'm ready
for my first solo?
Not yet, we need to work on your landing.
- Okay.
- We try it again next week, okay?
May I sit with you?
Let me introduce myself.
No need.
You're José Basulto.
At your service.
"Arch-enemy of the Cuban Revolution."
For me, that's a badge of honor.
You fought in Angola.
Tank commander.
Two years in the jungle.
54 missions.
Good reasons for us to get along.
Why?
We need men like you.
I'm not a politician.
Ever hear
of Gregorio Pérez Ricardo?
The kid was 15
when he fled Cuba on a raft.
But he wasn't as lucky as you.
The U.S. Coast Guard found him
so dehydrated,
they couldn't revive him.
So we set up an organization
called "Brothers to the Rescue",
to help our brothers.
So nothing like that ever happens again.
How do you plan to do that?
Eriberto, a coffee.
Want one?
Sure.
Two.
You know that
I used to be a violent man.
Trained by the U.S. as a terrorist.
My hero was John Wayne.
But not anymore.
Now I'm a kind of...
Jedi.
Like Luke Skywalker.
The Force is with us.
Understand?
Sort of.
It's all about solidarity, humanism.
We'll go find rafters in the sea
and guide them to freedom.
Thank you.
By monitoring the ocean.
We have the planes
but we don't have
enough pilots like you.
It's $25 a run,
plus 25 per flight hour.
Who pays?
Jorge Mas Canosa.
Money is not a problem for him.
The collapse of the Soviet Union
has raised people's hopes.
And yet...
Castro is holding on.
Without Russian money,
he won't last long.
When the regime collapses,
they'll have to return the refineries,
banks, factories. And casinos!
The stakes are enormous for every exile.
Take yourself.
You left your family there.
You're a brave man. You fled communism.
You started over here in Miami.
But
you have a choice to make.
Keep on gardening,
or help bring democracy
to our country.
November 2-5-0-6 to base.
Two rafts spotted at 24-53 by 81-42,
drifting north/north-east.
About 20 people aboard.
I repeat, 20 people aboard.
Dropping now, I repeat,
dropping now.
Dropping now.
You saved them.
Coast Guard on the way!
- Those poor people.
- Good job.
I hope they make it.
Sure they will. Look...
Hey, a gift from Willy Chirino.
Really?
And that one...
Gloria Estefan.
Damn!
Ask her to come christen it.
Good idea
but don't get your hopes up.
What are you doing?
We're crossing Parallel 24.
Entering Cuban airspace.
Listen.
We're not just
a humanitarian organization.
We're a militant organization.
Good afternoon, Havana.
This is November 2-5-0-6.
We are crossing Parallel 24.
Today, our operations will be
in the northern part of Havana.
Received, but I inform you
that the area north of Havana is active.
You will be at risk.
Copy. We are aware of the risk.
But, as free Cubans,
we are prepared to take it.
They're showing off.
Showing off, my ass.
Take over.
Follow the Malecon.
Turn right.
COMRADES NO! BROTHERS!
Dear Olga,
You haven't answered my letters.
I understand your reasons.
But understand mine.
I'm a pilot.
I don't want to be
a flight instructor all my life.
It's always tough at first
but this is a land of opportunities.
There are plenty for all of us.
I'm checking out schools for Irma.
Dear René,
I've received your many letters.
I'm so saddened by this,
I can't open them.
Here, life is very difficult.
Blackouts last eight hours,
and it's difficult to find food.
It's harder and harder
to get by on my own.
Irma is a big girl now.
She's asking questions.
I hate lying to her.
I don't want her to learn
her father's a traitor.
Believe it or not,
last week we got robbed.
They took all our valuables.
But I'm a fighter, you know that.
You also know I'm not angry with you.
I wish you luck in your new life.
But I regret to tell you,
it won't be with me.
Freeze!
Don't shoot!
I am a Cuban officer!
I am defecting!
My military I.D. My pilot's log.
Who's this guy?
He's my friend.
Arnaldo Ochoa.
Hero of the Cuban Revolution.
Hero of the war in Angola.
He was arrested and executed.
For drug smuggling.
An associate of Pablo Escobar also.
No. That's what the regime says
when they want to get rid of an opponent.
Thank you.
Eat up.
For someone who's been eating
McCastro's for years...
McDonald's is a delicacy.
Come on, why now?
General Ochoa was executed
three years ago.
I didn't think the regime would survive
the end of the Soviet Union.
And it did.
But then my brothers,
Alejandro and Raúl, also fighter pilots,
they were less patient than me.
They tried to run away
but got arrested and imprisoned.
Do you have any family?
Any children?
My wife, Amelia,
and two children.
Will they be joining you in the States?
We are divorced.
And she has custody of the children.
May I have your attention,
please. This is the final boarding call...
The couch is the best I can do.
- Don't worry about it.
- It'll help for a while.
It's perfect, thanks.
Listen...
We have associations
that help defectors.
But let me ask you something.
Why did you come?
To deliver pizzas or to strike it rich?
What about you?
Me?
I'm a biznero, dude.
You know me.
A little bit of everything.
And that's enough?
No way, man.
What do you think?
So?
Should I tell you?
I'm also an FBI informer.
I update them
on the community's mood.
And the pay is good.
Big money!
Thank you for the mass.
Really good. Thank you.
- Ana, hey!
- No!
- How are you?
- I'm good.
- It's been a long time. I can't believe it.
- Oh, my God. How have you been?
- I've been good. You look great!
- The family, good?
You know what?
Let me introduce you to somebody.
- Okay.
- Come here.
Cousin, come here.
This is my cousin,
Juan Pablo Roque.
- Very nice meeting you.
- Hi. Nice meeting you.
You're the officer who swam
to the U.S. base.
Yeah, that's me.
I know Guantanamo Bay.
You're not afraid of sharks?
Sharks, uh...
I was lucky.
Did anyone tell you
you look like a movie star?
Well, I am a movie star.
Or I like to think that I'm sexier
than a movie star, actually.
Thank you.
That was a lovely evening.
Was it lovely because you...
liked the movie?
Not only.
So... so I think
we will see each other again.
Wait.
No.
- Why?
- Because I have to go. I...
I don't want my ex-husband to see us.
Your ex-husband?
Yes. He's moving out.
But his apartment is being renovated.
So, he's staying with me in the meantime.
Is it over between you?
- Yes!
- So?
I just...
I'm afraid of him. He's violent.
I'll protect you.
You'll be my bodyguard?
- Yes. Like in the movie tonight.
- Like Kevin Costner for Whitney Houston?
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.
I'm gonna go.
- We'll meet again.
- We'll meet again!
You're a friend
of Nico Gutiérrez's?
His personal trainer.
Great!
Well, Nico
suggested I call you.
He's working out.
I've told him to for ages.
Look, Basulto.
Your pilot's log.
I was a major in the Air Force.
I used to fly MiGs.
You're more experienced than me.
Want to fly again?
I left Cuba
to fight the Castros.
In our organization,
there's an elite group.
We call them the kamikazes.
I'd like to know what it's about.
We don't respect safety rules
or the laws of aeronautics.
Meaning?
If you join us,
you'll be flying 9-hour days,
7 days a week, every month, no breaks.
Full time.
My friend...
That's illegal.
Illegal...
And very dangerous.
You're telling me!
I had a fire aboard.
Made a landing on Cayo Sal,
off Venezuela.
Man, was I in deep shit!
Truth is, Juan Pablo Roque,
we at Brothers to the Rescue
need pilots like you.
November 58 Bravo-Bravoto base.
Cuban Coastguard spotted at 23-80 by 81-77
heading north/north-west.
Bravo-Bravo to base.
Cuban Coastguard spotted...
Cuban Coast Guard ahead.
Change course.
South-southeast. Varadero.
Hey.
- How did it go?
- Things went wrong.
- Nabbed by the Cubans?
- Mm-mm.
They changed course.
Their engine broke down off Varadero.
U.S. Customs found them.
Seized their weapons.
Shit!
Hope they don't talk.
Mm-hmm.
No one must know we guided them.
Your family stayed in Cuba?
Yes.
Life is tough there, as you know.
Their connection to me
doesn't make things easier.
It complicates everything.
For them, I'm a traitor.
A gusano.
Sure your wife still loves you?
I'm still in love with her.
I can't live without that woman.
And I think she misses me.
So does my daughter.
I want to believe that.
What about you?
You're a star here, you're on TV and all.
Dude,
if I were a star,
I wouldn't be on this bus with you.
I'd be in a limousine.
You know what?
A paparazzi offered me 5,000
for pictures of me at the beach
with girls in bikinis.
What did you tell him?
Nothing.
I...
I'm starting my life over,
but not like that.
I get it.
I'm marrying Ana Margarita.
No way.
Good going, brother.
Olga.
Olga.
How did it go?
- Did you eat well?
- Yes.
A fight with her cousin.
I bit him.
Why did you bite him?
I'm not saying.
Go wash and straight to bed.
Look at the time.
Psst, hey!
No goodnight kiss for Uncle?
Come here.
See you tomorrow.
Goodnight, Uncle Roberto.
Goodnight, miss.
There are bags of his clothes
in the bedroom.
I'll give some to our father.
As long as you get rid of them.
I want nothing of René's here.
Now tell me
why you bit your cousin.
We played Memory.
I won all 10 rounds.
I told him I was the champ.
Always bragging.
He said I was the champ,
but my father is a traitor.
You should have explained.
Is it true Daddy's a traitor?
My sweetheart,
I've often told you
why Daddy went abroad.
To do business
to help our country's economy.
Fighting the U.S. embargo.
That's not being a traitor.
That's being a patriot.
Come here.
Look.
They all say the same thing.
I answered him once
and he should consider himself lucky.
What did you write?
I still love him,
but no way are Irma and I going
to the United States.
My daughter won't be raised by a traitor.
Or live close to a terrorist,
like José Basulto.
I heard René left Basulto
and joined the PUND.
Better pay, supposedly.
With them, you never know
where the fight for a free Cuba ends
and drug smuggling begins.
Know where René will end up?
In jail!
And I won't care a bit.
Keep going south.
South?
It's not our flight plan.
Did you follow the flight plan
when you were working for the Hermanos?
Not really.
So keep heading south.
Hurry up!
Faster!
Let's go!
You saw nothing.
I saw nothing.
Are you inspired today?
Let me see.
Don't start.
I'm super inspired.
Coño.
René...
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Good.
- Hope you're hungry.
- Pretty hungry.
- Will you get us some drinks?
- Yeah, right away.
Gracias.
Speak Russian?
I learned it in Cuba.
Like you.
Good.
It's about the PUND.
You know the rumor.
They're just a front.
Working with the Colombians.
Smuggling cocaine.
You said you didn't believe it.
First, I didn't.
Tequila.
Mariquitas de platanos!
- Like them?
- Love them.
She's some cook!
I bet.
Cheers!
Hermano.
Salud.
Ana, can you leave us alone
for a sec? We need to talk.
Yes. I'm sorry.
I flew
one of their loads myself.
I don't want to get arrested
for drug smuggling.
Roque...
I didn't come to the States
to end up in jail.
I told you.
My cousin Denayf works for the FBI.
He can put you in touch with his boss.
How are you?
René Gonzales.
Nice to meet you.
What I need is an airtight case.
So René...
How far will you go for us?
I won't take part
in their criminal activities.
I'll cut to the chase.
I'm offering you to be an FBI informer.
You'll get $1,500 a week.
All I ask of you
is to brief me on the PUND's activities.
Informer.
Not my thing.
Your friend Juan Pablo Roque
has been working for us for a year.
For the same money.
Now I get it.
Get what?
His lifestyle.
I'll need you tomorrow.
For a special operation?
All operations are special.
Landing in Honduras again?
And then in Nassau.
The money's good,
but it's too risky for me.
Got any other offers?
Ramón Saul Sánchez reached out to me.
MovimientoDemocracia needs good pilots.
Ramoncito?
Don't be a cocksucker.
I told you, man.
I'm working for the liberation of Cuba.
And I'm trying to finance it.
With drug money.
I take the money where I can find it.
From Colombians.
How else do you think
I can pay you 175 a week?
Can I count on you tomorrow?
No.
- Get out!
- Check in the back.
Turn around.
Tell me you're sure.
You made up your mind.
I'm no rat.
Who says working for the FBI
is being a rat?
At least it pays well.
I didn't sacrifice my life in Cuba
to make money here.
Life there is a disaster.
No gas.
Eight hours of electricity a day.
No medicine.
No food. People are starving.
Let me ask you a question.
Know how much
Movimiento Democracia charges
to bring people from Cuba to Florida?
A lot.
But it's for a good cause.
My job
is to save lives.
Who's going to be there?
Okay.
No, I can go.
Is it good for you tomorrow?
How you doing?
I'm almost finished
with the guest list for the reception.
Otherwise, I've got good news.
You wanna know what it is?
Of course I do.
Luis Alexander is going to let us use
the Alexander Mansion.
The Alexander Mansion in South Miami!
- I know! That's really good news.
- Yes!
And Jorge Mas Canosa will be there.
Never met him.
They're saying
it's gonna be the wedding of the decade.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course you can.
Why do you have a cellphone?
I don't know anyone else with one.
My friends' husbands
are happy with pagers.
- It's useful.
- Hmm?
You can reach me whenever you want
and I can call you...
I know how cellphones work. I got that.
It's very expensive.
- Not to mention the contract.
- It's useful.
You know,
I am aware of how much things cost.
- You have a new Rolex.
- Yeah, I do. It's a Rolex Submariner...
Silver with a blue dial.
You're very observant.
That costs $8000, at least.
- You're not far off.
- You bought it without telling me.
I don't tell you everything.
Where's the money coming from?
I know that there are fewer balseros
since the treaty with Cuba...
A lot fewer, yes.
Fewer sorties.
The Hermanos went
from 2000 a year to 200...
And your donations to organizations
that are helping them.
- You are 100% right!
- I know! That's why I'm asking...
Where do you get your money?
And I want a straight answer.
I already told you.
I signed a contract for an autobiography.
Excuse me. The one you've been writing
for six months? One hour a day max?
- Yes, that's the one.
- Really?
That is bullshit! Who are you kidding?
I've never heard of anyone making money
from writing.
Except you're a movie star
and you make a biography...
Well, I am. I'm a star, my love.
You're marrying a star.
And the book that I'm writing
for six months
- one hour per day is gonna be dynamite...
- You're lying.
'Cause I'm gonna tell everything
about the low morale in Cuban aviation...
The only way you have of making
that kind of money is with drugs.
So I wanna know.
What is it? Cocaine?
Do you want me to leave you?
Right now?
Answer!
Do you know how much this gold chain is?
I didn't flee Cuba to be a loser
in Miami, Ana.
I'm wearing a $2000 suit.
Does it bother you?
Does it bother you?
I'm not involved in drugs.
But you don't know everything
about me.
And it's better for you that way.
This is Charlie 4-0-4-7.
This is Charlie 4-0-4-7.
Blue Shark, do you copy?
This is Blue Shark, copy.
Flying along 24th Parallel, 82W.
The sea is clear.
I repeat: Sea is clear.
No Coast Guard. Let's go!
Chino!
Back from a mission?
Don't you have your own sources?
They say the operation was a success.
No casualties. But damage.
- Bad?
- Bad enough.
The Cubans won't shout it from rooftops,
as you can imagine.
The Movimiento may be proud. Not me.
Why, if it's not indiscreet?
I didn't join the resistance
to abet terrorists.
Just to save rafters.
A beer?
Why did you want to see me?
I got news from Olga.
Damn!
She's finally writing back?
Yes.
Her whole life is in Cuba.
Her career,
her friends, family.
- It must be tough for her.
- Yeah.
But
she's made a decision.
Really?
She'll come and live with me.
Okay, but
that's much easier said than done.
I'm a U.S. citizen.
And?
The new law prioritizes U.S. citizens.
It's not so simple.
There are quotas,
waiting lists, bureaucracy.
Which is why I need your help.
You have connections in Washington.
Does she have a Cuban exit visa?
No.
No use pulling strings
if they won't let her leave.
Bless and sanctify, Lord,
the love uniting
Juan Pablo and Ana Margarita.
Juan Pablo,
this ring is a symbol
of my love and my loyalty.
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.
- May I?
- You may kiss the bride.
Come,
I'd like to introduce you to someone.
Juan Pablo,
It is my honor to introduce you
to the President of the CANF,
Jorge Mas Canosa.
This man will lead us
to a free and democratic Cuba.
An honor to have you here.
A promise of success for our marriage.
My friend, Basulto, says
you're our best pilot.
Available at any hour.
Sir, with all due respect,
from now on,
you'll have to check with my wife
about that.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.
- He's very handsome.
- Thank you.
Here's the groom.
I'm very happy for you.
If only my wife were here.
She'll come, trust me.
Great crowd.
Jorge Mas Canosa, no less!
He rarely goes out in public.
It's an honor.
He wanted a picture with us.
He even called the press.
Come on!
- Ana.
- Oh, my God.
Got the missing document?
It arrived this morning.
This morning! I asked for it 3 weeks ago.
Now you can officially quit the tannery.
Are you making the right decision?
Yes, I am.
We need you.
And I know you like your job.
What will you do in Miami?
Start over from scratch?
My daughter needs a father. I told you.
Yes, but that father? A traitor.
Only one she has.
So,
you're sacrificing yourself.
That's one way of looking at it.
Thank you, Luis.
- Yanicé Rodríguez.
- Here.
Caridad de la Nuez.
Not here?
Olga Salanueva.
You go to that desk.
You come here.
- You go there.
- Hello.
Comrade, I brought the document
you requested last time.
And my daughter, as you asked.
Thank you. This will help your case.
But it's not the right one.
What?
I need one
from the Ministry of Light Industry.
- You have it now.
- No.
This is from the Tannery Directorate.
But the Directorate
is part of the Ministry.
Perhaps, but it's different.
- I need...
- No one will ever believe me.
Can I finish?
I'm sorry.
I need a waiver from the Ministry
releasing you from your contract
and stating you have no debts
with the State.
I have no debts at all.
So the document will be easy to get.
Yes?
I couldn't wait to tell you the good news.
I found a job.
For a cargo airline, Arrow Air.
We can get by until you get a job.
And if I pass my engineer exam,
you won't even have to work.
You're not happy?
Listen, René...
I went to the Ministry yesterday.
It didn't go well.
It's your father.
Leave me alone.
Another delay?
Even worse!
I had all the documents
but they invented a new one.
I'm so discouraged.
Please. Not now.
We're getting so close.
You know the real problem.
The problem is you.
Not the documents. It's you.
They'll never let me leave this country.
What's your name?
Manuel Viramontez.
Your parents?
Pedro Viramontez and Rosalina Carrea.
Place and date of birth?
Cameron County, Texas.
January 26, 1967.
My parents returned to Puerto Rico in '70.
Where they're from.
I'm an American citizen.
Your social security number?
584-56-5846.
Your address in Puerto Rico?
Darlington Building on Boriqueña Avenue,
00925, Apartment 6C,
Rio Piedras.
Phone number?
658-1117.
The building?
A white building, eleven floors.
On the first floor
there's a salsa station,
Radio Voz...
Very good, Lieutenant Hernandez.
How long have you been with us?
Six months... studying my role.
Like an actor.
Better than many actors.
I see here
that you joined a video rental club.
Two glass doors.
You had to knock to get in.
$3 a film.
Well, thank you. You're dismissed.
Sir...
So?
His Puerto Rican accent is perfect.
I think he's ready to move to Miami.
To run the Wasp Network.
- If you please.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Let's toast.
To what?
First, we toast.
Listen Adriana,
my International Relations thesis
was approved.
So no more money problems?
No more money problems.
University pays for travel.
Your travel?
I'm going away.
For several months.
But
we said we'd have a child.
We will.
When I come back.
When you come back.
Of course.
I don't want to hurt you.
- I'd hoped...
- For what?
You'd finish your studies here,
become a diplomat,
as you always said.
I will do that.
No.
You're going away.
Adriana,
what I'm telling you
mustn't leave this room.
For our love's sake,
it must never leave this room.
You have my word.
Anti-Castroist groups in Miami
want to choke Cuba's economy.
It's why they're attacking
our tourism industry.
They want the world to think
Cuba is dangerous.
The only way to stop them is to infiltrate
their organizations in Florida.
And find out what they're planning.
We already have
men on the ground.
They're waiting to be coordinated.
They asked me
to run this network.
And I said yes.
The Wasp Network.
René González
arrives on December 8, 1990.
Manuel Viramontez in December of 1991,
and Juan Pablo Roque in February of 1992.
The other agents arrive throughout 1992.
First Linda and Nilo Hernández.
Their cover: Running a medical instruments
export company to Cuba.
Their mission: Infiltrate Alpha 66,
the most aggressive terrorist group.
One, two, three...
Antonio Guerrero moves to Key West,
the base of anti-Castro radio stations.
He starts out as a salsa teacher
then gets hired as a lathe operator
at the Boca Chica military airport.
Ramón Labanino Salazar,
black belt in karate,
fakes his defection and
joins the network in Tampa
where his mission is to keep an eye
on Luis Posada Carriles
one of the most nefarious figures
of anti-Castro terrorism.
After four months of preparation,
state security agents Amarylis Silverio
and Joseph Santos
ride the third wave of emigration
to enter the United States.
Amarylis quickly finds a job
as a receptionist.
Can I help you?
Whereas Joseph has to make do
with odd jobs.
Others keep coming.
By the end of 1992, the Wasp Network
is fully operational.
The agents have no contact whatsoever
with one other.
Only Labanino, González and Villareal
are responsible for collecting information
and passing it on to Manuel Viramontez.
Each agent communicates via pager
with his superior.
Every two weeks,
the agent receives a message
indicating a spot to deliver
the information he has collected
and saved to a diskette.
Manuel Viramontez gathers the information,
then transmits it to Cuba
via shortwave radio.
The files that were too large,
he coded them, and mailed them
to a P.O. box in Central America
where a Cuban diplomat would pick them up
and forward them via diplomatic pouch.
During this period, the Wasp Network
was able to thwart 20 terrorist attacks,
and to seize a large quantity
of explosives, weapons and cash.
- What's this?
- C4!
In March '95, Cuban Americans
Martínez Rueda and Ramírez Oro
entered Cuba clandestinely by sea
to bury a load of explosives
they would use in an
attack on Hotel Melia in Varadero.
A few weeks later,
they flew back to execute their mission,
and were arrested
at José Martí Airport in La Havana.
Both confessed to taking orders from CANF.
Thanks to informations collected
by the Wasp Network,
30 terrorists were arrested,
both Cuban emigrants and mercenaries,
targeting tourist destinations in Cuba.
- Welcome.
- Hello.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
So.
You're joining your husband in Miami.
Yes, but I'm doing it for my daughter.
So she's near her father.
It's important that you know the truth.
Your husband, René González,
is not a traitor.
Your husband is a hero.
A hero?
He sacrificed everything
for our Revolution.
His relationship with you,
with your daughter.
He is in Miami on a mission.
To infiltrate terrorist organizations
and warn us about their plans.
He's helped save many lives.
Now that you're joining him,
you must know.
But most important
your daughter
must never find out.
Never.
Understand?
Do I have your word?
Yes.
Truth is, I made the same choice
as your husband.
- Mmm.
- I'm in Miami too.
I'm in contact with him,
and now with you.
I came back to tell you.
It's important that you understand:
Your safety,
your husband's,
your daughter's, mine,
everyone's safety
depends on you and your silence.
You can trust me.
My God!
All these years, I feel like...
Excuse me.
All this...
I need to take it in little by little,
not all at once.
I had an X-ray.
It's a sprain.
- A bad one?
- No, they say it'll heal in two weeks.
I'm good.
I feel good.
Can I ask you something?
- Sure.
- Your closet is empty.
Yes. The workers last week...
Juan Pablo, I can't see your eyes.
Can you take your glasses off?
- Mm-hmm.
- With the workers last week,
all my clothes were covered with dust,
so I took it to the dry cleaners.
I didn't want to bother you with it.
That's very kind of you.
I have to get up early tomorrow.
At three.
At three?
Yeah, I ferry a boat to Freeport.
I'll be gone for the weekend.
You have a bad arm.
You still gonna go?
Yes.
What if I need to contact you?
I'll keep my cellphone on.
Remember?
You're my bodyguard.
Yes.
Your bodyguard.
Like Kevin Costner.
Look at me.
I will always protect you.
Always.
Damn! Ever the star!
I'll help you!
Hey, sir!
How did you do that?
I slipped in the shower.
I'm sorry.
And you can't fly?
No... not with a brace.
Hmm.
We had to reorganize at the last minute.
Don't miss the plane.
All areas
within the terminal building...
Your ticket to Havana.
If you'd like to make a call...
In the fall of 1995,
more than 130 independent groups
joined forces,
calling themselves the Concilio Cubano.
They announced three goals:
A peaceful transition to democracy,
amnesty for political prisoners,
and participation by Cuban exiles
in the transition to democracy.
The reprisal was brutal.
The Castro regime attacked ConcilioCubano
with all of its strength.
In February, they went all out.
They ransacked homes.
They attacked people.
They imprisoned hundreds
of human rights activists.
People who didn't have weapons.
People who only aspired
to gather peacefully in La Havana.
Mr. Basulto!
Do you have anything to say
about the situation in Cuba?
Well, we don't have much information,
but this is obviously the reaction
of the government on its last legs,
and proof of the strength
of the democratic movement.
For all Cubans craving freedom,
the hour of truth has arrived.
Today Hermano will drop flyers
over Havana
in support of the Concilio Cubano.
Give us our course,
our direction...
Give us our course, our direction,
and guide our planes
to our brothers on the sea.
And guide our planes
to our brothers on the sea.
Good luck.
Good luck, everyone.
Good afternoon,
Havana Center. This is November 2-5-0-6,
crossing the 24th Parallel.
Today our area of operation will be
the region north of Havana.
Good afternoon,
November 2-5-0-6.
Airspace to the north of the city
is restricted airspace.
If you cross the 24th Parallel,
you're putting yourself in great danger.
We know we are in danger
each time we cross south of 24.
But we are ready to do it. As free Cubans,
we have the right to be here.
Reporting hostile movement
of Cuban fighter planes.
Hello Riverdale.
We have two planes ready for action,
but superior orders forbid them
from taking off.
I repeat:
We have express orders not to intervene.
Spirit of Miami,
change your speed to 150.
Here's Spirit of Miami.
Changing to 150.
4-6-8 what is your altitude?
1,700 meters. Three planes in sight.
Switch on your radars.
Copy that.
Target locked. It's a private plane.
We've got company.
Enemy MiGs flying around us.
There's no risk.
Just scare tactics!
Permission to shoot.
Now or never! Permission, dammit.
- Authorized.
- 4-6-5, permission granted.
He vanished.
Sure he's not behind us?
Got him!
Got the bastard!
Seagull One? Hear from Spirit?
Negative.
See smoke on my left?
I see smoke!
The two other Cessnas?
Yes, still on course.
Stay in the zone at a low speed.
See the MiG?
The MiG?
Where the fuck is it?
No...
I see flames.
Where are the flames?
Damn it! Answer!
Another plane ahead.
Permission to shoot.
Authorized.
4-6-5. Permission to fire.
Where the fuck is the MiG?
Son of a bitch!
Destroyed!
Our country or death!
They're fucking shooting!
- Hello?
- Is Roque there?
Hi René!
No, he left for the weekend.
He can't be reached.
Is he with the Brothers?
No, he broke his arm. He can't fly.
Thank God!
What's going on?
Turn on your TV.
Something very tragic
that we have dreaded for a long time,
I believe happened today.
I believe we lost our first pilots.
These small airplanes were unarmed,
and clearly so.
Cuban authorities knew that.
The planes posed no credible threat
to Cuba's security.
I want to ask the world
which self-respecting country
would be willing to accept,
on its own territory,
the major violations perpetrated
against ours...
Look! Look, there she is!
Ms. Martínez!
Circumstances of how you left Cuba
and why you returned are rather murky.
Sorry to ask you so bluntly, Mr. Roque,
are you a spy for the Cuban government?
I am not a State Security agent.
I left Cuba for personal reasons,
my divorce.
But why did I decide to return?
I returned because I became frustrated
over there in the United States.
I became frustrated with that society.
I became frustrated
with the political intolerance
in the emigrant community.
I wasn't happy with the life I was living.
I was deceived by militants,
claiming to be patriots,
but who were in fact organizing
terrorist actions in Cuba
while pretending to give humanitarian aid.
They were told many times
not to violate Cuban airspace.
Many times.
And I said it to José Basulto.
You can ask him.
"Basulto, this is crazy,
they're gonna shoot down your planes."
Can I end this
with a personal question?
What will you miss most
about your life in Miami?
My Jeep Cherokee.
Come on, Irma!
Don't be greedy!
Little girl
you're not in Cuba anymore.
You don't have to save food.
My girl!
You're different.
Very?
Yes.
Welcome.
- My girl.
- Dad.
- How are you?
- Good.
My child, do you remember me?
I'm your great-grandmother, Teté.
You were a baby
when I left Cuba.
Look! This old lady is my sister Gladys.
- How are you?
- Good, and you?
- Good.
- Really good, no?
Leave it. I'll do that.
I'll say good night to Irma.
You glad to be in Miami?
I'm scared.
Scared of what?
I don't know.
Of life.
Life here?
Everything's different.
I know.
Daddy's here.
You have nothing to fear.
Look.
This photo of Fidel...
Hide it.
What is it?
If you were really a traitor,
you'd have torn it up.
Sleep well.
I have some friends
who said they'd help us.
They mentioned
a job not far from here.
In an old people's home.
You'll have time to take care of Irma.
It'll be hard to keep Irma out of this.
Better to keep things as they are.
You had no problem keeping me out of it.
Will you forgive me?
Truth is, I don't know.
I understand you.
And I, you.
You did it for your country,
for our Revolution.
I respect that. I even admire you.
But the cost was high.
For us, for your family.
I don't know if you realize
what we went through.
For years I had a pain here
that wouldn't go away.
I feel the same way.
It won't be easy to forget.
It's not the life I wanted
for my daughter and me.
I'll make up for it...
You made a decision
and we had to deal with it.
Those wounds need time to heal.
Remember how old Irma was
when you left?
- Come on...
- She was 6.
Olga, please...
Don't remind me how old she was
when I left Cuba.
But remember it was your choice,
not mine, not hers.
I am here with you. In Miami.
I never gave up on being your wife,
not even in Cuba.
Being the wife of a traitor there
isn't easy.
And I'm glad I made that choice.
Why do you think
I trained in radio transmission?
And all that other stuff.
So I can help you! To be on your side.
But don't expect it to happen overnight.
I need time.
I need time, and so does our daughter.
You have all the time in the world.
As long as you give me reason to hope.
Shh.
Don't worry.
We're together again.
Can I hope?
Of course.
I've always loved you. Always.
Please change
Mr. Barbeito's bed. He soiled it.
Yes, ma'am.
You have many aliases:
Solo, Ramón Medina, Basilio, Lupo.
How should I refer to you?
I am Luis Posada Carriles.
You can use my real name.
Mr. Posada Carriles,
how would you explain your relationship
with the Cuban American
National Foundation?
Jorge Mas Canosa, the chairman,
is a dear friend.
And how would you define that friendship?
Uh, we both love deep sea fishing.
And he buys my paintings.
Your paintings?
Yes, I paint traditional Cuban landscapes.
It's how I make a living.
These documents here,
they show
some recent very important transfers
from the Cuban American
National Foundation in New Jersey
to a Salvadoran resident, Ramón Medina.
Do you confirm
that Ramón Medina is one of your aliases?
Yes, I do.
And you deny these payments are associated
with terrorist activities?
Castro loves
to blame me for everything.
Do you know
what living in Cuba is like today?
I do, I was there.
It's communism.
It's an economic failure.
We are at war with communism.
Since Roque defected,
Mas Canosa thinks there are more moles.
It's become too dangerous for the CANF
to plan attacks on Cuba.
They don't want to put the U.S. in a jam.
So they have to keep
a low profile.
Thank you.
They need a new strategy.
To step up their ops.
Can we implicate Mas Canosa?
No smoking gun.
They're very cautious.
And guess who's in charge.
Luis Posada Carriles.
Posada Carriles, that motherfucker.
They're recruiting in Central America.
Nicaragua, El Salvador.
They want mercenaries.
Guys who'd kill their moms for a buck.
You need money?
I'm good.
So why you selling your car?
It's my sister's. We live together.
One car is enough.
If you need anything,
just call.
You know,
I have friends who'd pay a man like you,
reliable and brave.
I don't touch drugs.
This isn't about drugs.
It's about planting a bomb.
What for?
No questions. It's part of the deal.
I'll answer you once and for all.
In 1989,
Cuba produced 8 million tons
of cane sugar.
Today... three million or less.
Without tourism,
their economy would plummet
and the Castro regime would collapse.
You have to hit where it hurts.
Hotels, beaches.
It's dangerous.
15,000 Colones per bomb.
And legal fees in case of trouble.
- Welcome to Cuba.
- Thank you.
Old Havana.
Sorry I'm late.
My meeting just ended.
We're enjoying our last day in Cuba.
Tonight we'll be freezing in Toronto.
Come, I booked a restaurant.
What was that?
Construction work at Hotel Panorama.
Mind if I take off my T-shirt?
Do as you please.
Your pants too if you want.
You're the customer.
- Why are we stuck?
- Roadblock.
Something happen?
Must be Fidel going somewhere.
They want us somewhere else!
Let's go!
- Yes?
- Congratulations.
The attacks made the press.
I told you I don't care.
I need money. I can't even afford a taxi.
Your money is in Havana.
An envelope at Hotel Capri.
Wait here. I'll get the money.
Raúl Ernesto Cruz León. That's my name.
Nothing in that name, sir.
An envelope?
No, this is all I have.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Don't try to resist!
We saw you dumping this stuff
in a trash can in Cervantes Park.
Recognize it?
No.
The explosions
at the Tritón and Chateau hotels
left only minor injuries
and material damage.
But at the Copacabana,
an Italian tourist had his throat slit
by a metal shard.
He's dead.
If you cooperate
you may be able to save your ass.
Otherwise
it's the firing squad.
Excuse me. Thank you.
Hey, man.
- Olga?
- In the bathroom.
So?
You have news.
Mas Canosa is very sick.
- How sick?
- He won't last the year.
They have a plan to kill Fidel.
It's in here.
As always.
Mas Canosa's last wish.
Last wish indeed.
On Margarita Island, Venezuela.
The Ibero-American Summit.
- That's very soon, barely a month away.
- Yes.
They have a boat, the Esperanza,
leaving from Puerto Rico.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Listen,
let's pass this on to the FBI.
- The FBI?
- Yes.
Catch the CANF red-handed
and we score a major victory, man.
Hello, Olga.
- How are you?
- Good.
Let's toast.
To what?
Cruz León's arrest.
Four bombs. One dead tourist.
- You feel responsible?
- Sure.
We're here to stop that.
We did what we can.
We tracked them down,
dismantled their organization.
The recruiter is on the run now.
But we have reasons to celebrate.
Indeed.
We have some good news for you.
What's happening?
I'm pregnant!
Yes.
We waited to tell you until we were sure.
Now we are.
I had an ultrasound.
Everything's fine. It's a girl.
Congratulations! Great news.
- Thank you.
- Got a name yet?
- Yes, Ivett.
- Ivett.
- Pretty, isn't it?
- Yes, very.
Ivett... I like it.
- How is Irma doing?
- Fine.
She speaks fluent English.
- Irma is jealous, of course.
- Hmm.
But she'll get over it.
We all have to. Just watch out.
I know, poor thing.
But there's no other remedy
but to learn she's not the center.
Esperanza for Baranof.
This is US Coast Guard Cutter Baranof.
Please state your purpose
in these waters.
Esperanza to Baranof. We're tourists.
We're on a fishing trip.
Final destination?
Santa Lucia.
Down here.
Is this your fishing gear?
Those weapons are mine.
My passengers had no idea...
Anything you say
may be held against you.
They are to be used to kill Fidel Castro.
And I am proud of it.
President Castro gave me a message
to be delivered to President Clinton
in person.
The president will be informed.
Cuban intelligence have been gathering
overwhelming information
for several years now.
We keep a close eye
on Cuban exile organizations.
Then you know
that the CANF is financing terrorists
and that the operations
are carried on by mercenaries
recruited in Central America.
Is Cuba willing to share its intel?
I'm sure
if you approach the Cuban authorities,
they will respond positively.
In front of you,
you will find three files.
The first,
is the report on terrorist activities
against Cuba since 1990.
You will find proof that most operations
led by other groups,
were, in fact, commissioned by the CANF.
In the second, you have a list
of 40 Cuban exiles
identified as active terrorists.
And in the third, money wired by the CANF
to terrorist Luis Posada Carriles,
establishing his connection to CANF.
Those are your conclusions?
All the facts are here
at your disposal.
You think
the heads of the CANF will be affected
by the Cuban intel given to the FBI?
Well...
Mas Canosa is not around anymore.
He passed.
He always said
he didn't want to know of my activities.
I don't think the CANF
will be upset.
But the communist Cubans
have a lot to worry about.
Why would you say that?
Do the math.
Where does Cuban intel come from?
A Cuban spy ring in Miami.
Honestly
you think the FBI
can tolerate such activities
on American soil?
I highly doubt it.
I highly doubt it.
Good afternoon.
I'm Olga Salanueva
from Ingles Ahora.
We are offering to perfect your English
in order to assimilate better into so...
Fine.
Yes, yes. Some other time.
Sorry to bother you.
Thank you very much.
Olga!
Where are you going?
To pick up my daughter at daycare.
But it's not time to leave.
I told you to figure something out.
I know, but the school is far. I'm sorry.
- How's it going?
- Great.
- How about your exam?
- 9/10.
Hey, honey.
Here on Friday?
No Movimiento Democracia meeting?
It's next week instead.
Great.
So I'm home. Enjoying a rest.
What about you?
Can you change her?
I smell something off.
Something off?
What did you do?
I'll help.
That's why you're crying.
proposed.
Combined...
Look at me!
What?
Nice light. I want a picture.
In my underwear?
Closer. I want the three of you.
Look at the camera!
Move to the right!
Pick up the left!
- Clear!
- Show me your hands!
On your knees!
You're under arrest
for spying on the United States of.
Come here!
Get that kid out of here!
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say, can and will...
Don't move!
- Papa!
- Calm down!
Irma! Don't touch my daughter!
You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say, can and will be used
against you in the court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot provide yourself with one,
one will be provided for you.
Do you understand these rights
as I have read them?
Yes.
Olga, don't worry, my love.
Can I change
my daughter's diaper?
Someone will come with you.
Your husband is an agent
in a Cuban spy ring.
Not that I think
that that surprises you very much.
Nine other agents
have been placed under arrest.
We're here to ask you to collaborate
with the United States government.
Your baby was born
in the United States. She's a citizen.
This is not the case for you
and your older daughter.
You understand that you can be deported
at any moment?
I understand.
I want to talk to my husband.
I can't let you do that.
All rise.
The Federal Court of Miami
is now in session.
The Honorable Judge Lenard presiding.
The United States against
Manuel Viramontez and associates.
You are accused of conspiracy
to commit espionage,
acting as foreign agents not registered
with the United States government,
- falsifying documents...
- Daddy!
And perjury,
filling out immigration forms.
Such bad manners.
- What?
- Nothing. Don't look.
Excuse me,
do you know any of the accused?
Can you answer my question?
Amarylis, it's me Olga.
Good and you?
Imagine here!
I need a favor.
Can you get Ivett to daycare?
You have no idea of the circus here.
Olga,
can you follow me a moment please?
Yes.
Please, have a seat.
I guess you don't want to continue
to employ the wife of a Cuban spy.
Look, as far as I know,
you haven't been convicted of anything.
So for me, first and foremost,
you're a mother
that has two children to feed.
I've had my own problems with the FBI.
I know what scumbags those guys can be.
So please, go back to work.
Please let me come.
I'd love to. But you know you can't.
And you must watch your sister.
In this bag, milk, water and diapers.
Tell Daddy I love him.
Believe me, he'll be overjoyed.
He sacrificed his family.
Don't say that!
Your father is brave,
guilty only of fighting for his country.
- How about us?
- He does his duty.
I wish he wasn't a soldier.
I won't tell him that.
I'll say his daughter is like him.
Strong and courageous.
Can I?
Hey, can I?
I'm getting by.
I was able to keep my job.
I'm glad.
My boss is a good man.
Who'd have thought?
What?
I'm trying to imagine your life in jail.
I'm in a 6-by-12 foot cell.
The only light comes
from a horizontal slat.
20 inches long, 6 inches wide.
High up and out of reach.
That's my life.
And the girls?
How are they dealing with it?
It's tough, especially for Irma.
But we're okay.
The FBI offered me a plea deal.
What does that mean?
Informing for a reduced sentence.
And?
Five of the others agreed to it.
They'll speak?
You won't cooperate, will you?
You and the girls will be deported
if I don't.
Mr. President, as you know,
10 Cuban Americans, of Cuban origin,
were arrested and accused
of spying for your government.
What can you say about this?
What struck me, and we denounced it
to the U.N.,
was how amazing it was
that the biggest spy in the world
would accuse of espionage
the most spied upon country
in the world.
Yes, we have sent Cuban citizens
to infiltrate
counter-revolutionary organizations.
In order to report back
on activities of great interest to us.
And I think we have the right to do so.
As long as the U.S. tolerates
the organization of sabotage,
armed incursions,
attacks of tourist facilities,
smuggling weapons and explosives,
and attacks on our economy,
our tourism industry.
All these things which we have denounced.
Little darling...
Give a kiss to Daddy,
give him a kiss.
- Show him your duck.
- My love.
Ducky fell again?
Another kiss.
She's a beauty.
Prettier than her pictures.
I brought you a package.
They need to check it first.
I'll get it later.
Mostly food and books.
It's your birthday, remember?
I'm sorry Irma isn't here.
She's safer in Cuba.
I know.
She's with her Granny,
who takes good care of her.
- You speak?
- Every day.
School's going well?
Yes. And she asks about you every day.
I can't talk to her yet.
It's too painful.
Tell her Daddy loves her.
I tell her that every day.
When things get better,
we'll be together again.
You know it won't be soon.
You and Ivett will go to Cuba
to join Irma.
Then what?
I won't cooperate.
I just told my lawyer.
I can't testify against my brothers.
I just can't.
Even those
who testify against you?
No.
Their morals aren't mine.
Tell me if I have your support.
Yes, you do.
We'll be separated for a while.
You know that.
I won't let you go through this alone.
I'll visit you as often as they let me.
I'll always be there for you.
And for our daughters.
I promise.
Sure you won't stay?
I have to go.
We must be prepared.
I understand.
When things clear up,
I'll come back for her.
And if they don't?
Then she'll stay with you for a while.
I know you'll tend to her
as if you were her mother.
Thank you.
Teté.
Look at her, so tiny. And so sweet.
Mama.
We'll see each other soon.
Look at me.
Look at Mommy.
I love you.
A little kiss.
Come with Grandma.
Bye!
See you soon!
I love you.
- I adore you.
- Bye, Mommy!
Thank you, Teté.
I love you.
Bye-bye, Mommy!
See you soon.
Mommy!
See you, Mommy!
Mommy.
Mrs. Salanueva?
We need you to come with us.
Calm down, ma'am.
