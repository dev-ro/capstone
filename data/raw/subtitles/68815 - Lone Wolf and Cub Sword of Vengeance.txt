The Toho Company
and Katsu Production Co. Present:
Young Lord!
Why do they have
to be so cruel?!
Lord... We will join
you in death!
All of us... we'll avenge your passing...
one day, for certain!
We understand the edicts...
but our Lord is so young!
Young Lord!
Young Lord!
Young Lord!
Young Lord!
Young Lord!
Young Lord!
Everyone... compose yourselves!
It is most unseemly for you
to behave in this manner!
For now, we must maintain
our composure...
...and witness
his passing.
That is our duty as...
...his vassals!
I am the Second designated by
the Shogunate... Ogami Itto.
Please...
Please be merciful!
If you just... hold this fan to your belly...
all will be well, Young Lord.
Do you understand?
This is how the ruler of a castle and
domain conducts himself...
This is the way of the true
Samurai, Young Lord!
The Tokugawa Shogunate imposed
excessive taxes...
"Daimyo:" Military Clan Chieftains.
...upon the Daimyo.
The Shogunate freely exercised
its right to execute anyone...
...that showed the slightest
trace of disobedience.
To implement the cruel governmental
edicts of the Shogunate...
...three groups were
established.
First, the spies, who are ever watchful
for the first sign of disloyalty.
Second, the assassins, who kill any who
interferes with the Shogunate's plans.
And third, the executioner who acts as a
"Second," and beheads those Daimyo...
"Seppuku:" Ritual suicide (aka "harakiri").
...who are ordered to
commit seppuku.
The spies belong to
the Kurokuwa Clan.
The assassins belong
to the Yagyu Clan.
Finally... the post of Official Shogunate
Second belonged to one Ogami Itto...
...who was specially authorized
to wear sacred official robes...
...bearing the emblem
of the Shogunate.

Banner: "Ogami - Suiouryu Technique
Child and Expertise for Rent"
Wh... What was that?!
Hmm... lemme see...
"Suiouryu:" Seagull.
"Child and Expertise for rent... Suiouryu
School... Ogami Itto."
"Ookami Itto:" Wolf-Sword.
Ookami Itto?! What
the heck's that?
"Ronin:" a samurai without a master.
No, not "Ookami...", "Ogami Itto." Seems
that's the name of that ronin.
I understand the part about
lending his "expertise..."
Yes, I'm wondering
the same...
But, oh my... the man looks like a
wreck, and he's got a child too!
Is he able to make
a living?!
Oh! He's so adorable!
So adorable, it's pathetic!
O-Hime!
No, O-Hime!
O-Hime! Get back! What do
you think you're doing?!
Toramatsu!
O-Hime!
O-Hime!
Toramatsu!
No, O-Hime! What are you doing?
That's someone else's child!
I apologize for her rude behavior!
Please forgive us!
I am truly sorry.
Pardon me, sir, but it says that
your child is for rent...
...but can you really
lend him to us?
Toramatsu... You must have
been starving, Toramatsu!
There!
There! It's your mother's milk.
Have as much as you want!
Daigoro.
There! There!
Good, isn't it?
Gooood, isn't it?
Toramatsu...
There! Good Boy!
Thank you very
much, sir.
Good Boy...
Toramatsu... I'll come see you again,
when I save up enough money, OK?
Oh, just a moment... I
hope this is enough.
I need no money. It so happens
that he was hungry anyway.
I see. Thank you
very much!
She was deceived and then
abandoned by a man...
...and she gave the child to
another family to raise...
...but the baby died
from a fever.
Ever since then... my daughter
has been deranged...
...and can no longer distinguish between
her child and those of others.
Dammit... It's starting
to rain!
Welcome back
home, Dear.
What's wrong? Why
are you so pale?
What is on your
mind... tell me?
Yes...
Lately... I've been having
awful nightmares.
The voices may be the souls of those
you've beheaded... they curse me...
...from ponds of blood... or mountains
of spikes... from ghastly places...
I can hear them, as they send
chills down my spine.
They say that they'll put a curse
upon the Ogami line...
...and they keep repeating
that over and over.
I am consumed with fear
for our child's safety.
It is so unlike you...
you're so strong.
You must be tired.
Azami... you do
remember...
...the reasons why I named
him Daigoro.
No matter how poor he might become,
he will not be grief-stricken.
No matter how rich he might become,
he will not look down upon others.
The Buddhist planes... of Hell... Hungry
Ghosts... Animals... Evil Gods...
...and of the God-like
beings...
...by reminding him of these, his name will
ensure he grows up stalwart and resolute.
Yes.
Don't worry. He will become strong...
Strong enough to face anything.
Dear...
Now that Daigoro is a year
old, I'll take him...
...with me to pay our respects to the
souls of those I've executed.
We'll go to our memorial shrine
and offer our prayers.
A mendicant monk...?
Azami!
Azami! Azami!
Azami!
D... Daigoro... Daigoro...
Azami!
Who has done
this to you?!
Who did this...?
Whoever you are...
...l'll follow you to the
ends of the Earth...
...I will find you no matter
what it takes...
...and I will have
my vengeance!
No matter what it takes!
Attention: The Honorable Inspector
Bizen of Yagyu...
...is here on official
business.
Inspector Bizen...
I was afraid of this... that it
would turn out this way.
What do you mean, honored
Inspector?
Before dawn, three men committed
seppuku at the gates of my House.
I rushed here immediately after
hearing of their Declaration.
"Declaration?"
"We hereby declare that..."
"...in order to avenge our
Lord Hirotada's death..."
"...the household of the Executioner,
Ogami, must be put to the sword."
"While Ogami Itto is indeed the
sole official Executioner..."
"...we have discovered that he abuses
the powers of his position..."
"...and is a traitor who blasphemes
the Great Shogunate."
"The proof will be found in
the Ogami's own shrine."
"Remembering our Lord,
who was executed..."
"...by a traitor who spits on the
honor of the Shogunate..."
"...we hereby dedicate our lives
to the destruction of his line..."
"...and as proof of our sincerity, will
now join our Lord in the void."
"Signed: The three lkoma
Clansmen..."
"Odai Hyougo... Atobe Shichinosuke...
and Makijima Gorouzaemon..."
"...Sealed in Blood."
So you see, as three warriors have paid
their lives to present this Declaration...
...I must now exercise my official
right to inspect your shrine.
Ogami... take me
to the shrine.
To pay respect to, and to offer
prayers for the souls...
...of those I have been ordered to
execute by the Shogunate...
...I have built
this shrine.
It is most respectful!
I am moved... It does you
great credit, Ogami.
Why, it's...!
What do we have here?!
Of all things... a death memorial tablet
bearing the emblem of the Shogunate!
Ogami! What is the meaning of this?!
Why a Shogunate tablet?!
Answer! Exactly what is it that
you pray for at this shrine?
I know nothing... I know nothing about this
tablet! Who could do something like this?!
What the men said in their
Declaration was true.
I know nothing of this!
This must be...
How dare you presume to
talk your way out of this!
As the Official Inspector, I order you
to accompany us back to our office!
Take him!
Men, take Ogami Itto!
This is too odd! Inspector Bizen...
What is the meaning of these
uniformed men...?
Was it your intent to take me
away from the beginning?
Naturally, in such an
emergency as this!
If that were so, they would
have come here openly.
Besides, there shouldn't have been
any reason to hide your uniforms!
Furthermore... how do you
explain the armor?!
If you were in such a rush to come here,
why did you take the time to don this?
No more questions! If you seek
answers, do it in court!
You planned this, Bizen!
This whole incident only makes sense
if it's a plot of the Yagyu Clan!
You've lost your
mind, Itto!
The suicide of the lkoma Clansmen
was inexplicable...
...as I knew nothing about
their claim, but...
...when seen as a plot by you to effect
my downfall, it all makes sense!
It's all too perfect!
I've long known that...
...the Yagyu Shadow-Clan lusts
after the post of Executioner.
That is why you plotted this, isn't it!
That is why you plotted this, isn't it!
"Yagyu Shadow-Clan?"
What do you mean by a
"Shadow-Clan?"
Are you saying that the House of Yagyu
has two faces... light and dark?
Indeed... Yagyu Munenori's sons: Jubei,
Mitsuyoshi, Tomonori, and Munefuyu...
...appear to rule what the world thinks of
as the Yagyu Clan. Yet, another child...
...Gisen, also known as Retsudo,
forever lurks in the shadows!
Retsudo is your grandfather...
...and it is he who is the true Lord of the
Yagyu Clan... the master schemer.
I've long been aware of the existence
of the Yagyu Shadow-Clan!
You've secretly made arrangements
with the Shogunate...
...and managed to corrupt these
men of Investigator Kurokuwa.
And now, by plotting to
put an end to me...
...you seek to obtain the post
of Official Executioner!
That emblem, of Two
Umbrellas...
...fools the world into believing you
are Shogunate Arms-lnstructors...
...ordinary members
of the Yagyu Clan.
But, the Shadow-Yagyu
have also been using...
...a family emblem inherited from
Mimasakanokami leyoshi...
...the emblem of Burnet and Sparrow,
and that is the ultimate proof!
Well?
Brilliant as always,
Ogami Itto.
I am most impressed by the depth
of your knowledge about us.
But, as things stand, I am of the opinion
that you should die right here and now.
It will appear as if Ogami Itto fought
the lkoma Clan and was killed.
It has all been perfectly
planned out.
I see... You forced those lkoma Clansmen
to write their Declaration...
...and then you made them
commit seppuku.
You Yagyu have used any method to
destroy those standing in your way.
This is unforgivable...
Unforgivable, as long as I live!
Unforgivable, as long as I live!
Kill him!
Go! Go!
No...
If you enter the water...
... you'll fare even worse against
his Suiouryu techniques!
Bizen... how could you
be so foolish?!
No... not the Suiouryu
Wave-Slashing Stroke!
So, you are Retsudo of the Shadow-Yagyu!
So, you are Retsudo of the Shadow-Yagyu!
You naive fool!
You people have resorted to the
most despicable tactics...
...to gain prosperity at the
expense of others.
For this, there is
no forgiveness!
The misery you've inflicted
upon my family...
...shall in turn be inflicted
upon the Shadow-Yagyu!
The Shogunate endures and
thus, the Yagyu endure...
The Yagyu endures and thus,
so too does the Shogunate...
Do not forget that we are inextricably
bound together!
No matter what you do or
how much you struggle...
...your fate is already
sealed.
Come face me...
Retsudo!
No, I will not
fight you...
Now that Bizen
is dead...
...the Shogunate will officially
sanction our actions.
Wash your neck, and
await my return!
Hold it, Retsudo!
Unforgivable! You Yagyu shall
not be forgiven! No, never!
The line of the ordinary Yagyu
ended at the river of water...
...and the line of the Shadow-Yagyu
shall end in the river of fire.
Between fire and water lies the white
road, and I shall follow it...
...no matter where it takes me...
even if I become a corpse...
...or ashes... I shall have
my revenge, one day!
What is it, sir?
He has come.
Two years ago, after fighting the Yagyu,
the Official Executioner disappeared.
The Shogunate's Official
Executioner?
Then... this Ogami Itto...
...is someone whom not even the best
of the Yagyu could vanquish.
Then he's...
...the assassin called
the "Lone Wolf and Cub..."
I am sure that you have heard
of him as well.
I am sure that you have heard
of him as well.
But... we have no idea
if he is Ogami Itto...
...although he claims to
be available for hire.
But... if he turns out to
be Ogami Itto, then...
...Chamberlain!
My fellow men...
...when we left our homeland, we
all pledged to give our lives...
...in the service of Oyamada
Sanmangoku Clan.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
You are our Clan's
strongest men.
If he turns out not to be Ogami
Itto... you'll be able to kill him.
Understood, sir. We
two will kill him...
...although perhaps it is better
if we are the ones who die...
Chamberlain! We'd be glad
to give our lives for you!
I am the Edo Chamberlain of the
Oyamada Clan, Ichige Gyobu.
I have sought a meeting
with you...
...as it is whispered that you are Ogami
Itto, the former Official Executioner...
...and, if so, we would like to request
your assistance with a grave matter.
Please excuse us for
our impoliteness.
Tell me your
business.
We would like to request
the deaths...
...of a certain group
of four men.
For 500 pieces of gold, your
request will be fulfilled.
The number of victims
is of no consequence.
And, one more thing...
I ask that you tell me everything
related to this request.
Please examine these.
I am listening.
Chamberlain Sugito
is plotting...
...to assassinate our Clan's heir, Lord
Noriyuki, who is in poor health...
...and to install Lord Takemaru,
of a branch family, as heir...
...thereby gaining control
of the Oyamada Clan.
Lord Noriyuki will be leaving
Edo in two days...
...making his first visit to
this part of the country.
Undoubtedly, the Chamberlain
will not miss this opportunity.
From what we were able
to secretly determine...
...he has gathered
a band of ronin...
...and is waiting for
our Lord to arrive.
Along the Nikko road...
...several miles before one reaches
the city of lmaichi...
...lies a mountain road
called "Ootawara..."
There, in the outskirts of
the Oyamada domain...
...is a bathing palace
called "Gounomori."
Chamberlain Sugito is sure
to have his men there.
I was previously informed
that our Lord...
...will be visiting the hot-springs
of Gounomori for a meeting.
The three of us were preparing to fight
Chamberlain Sugito and his men...
It was for that reason
that we came here.
Following the orders of Chamberlain
Sugito are...
...three first-class swordsmen known
as the "Oyamada Three."
Of these, Matsuki Juunai, who
holds the office of inspector...
...is an expert horseback
musketeer.
We are no match for
him in a fair fight.
Because of this, we had planned
to ambush him.
Use your talents and destroy the
evil Chamberlain Sugito...
...somehow...
I beg you.
From high up in the mountain,
if you shit a rocky turd, oh...
It'll be all covered
with sand...
It'll tumble down
like a pebble...
There goes one!
Here goes one!
There goes one...
Daigoro...
Soon, the Shogunate's
men will be arriving.
But, your father intends to disobey
the Shogunate's orders...
...and to flee from this
region of the realm.
In order to avenge our family, the house-
hold of the Executioner Ogami...
...and to vindicate my honor, I will
abandon my samurai life...
...and I shall become a true
demon, bound by no rules!
Hear me, Daigoro.
From now on, your
father shall...
...follow a road of blood
and corpses...
...as an assassin in the world
of killing without remorse.
By taking assignments
as an assassin...
...all that our family
has suffered...
...can be returned back
to the Yagyu!
Daigoro... The road you will take
shall be chosen by you alone.
If you choose this Doutanuki Sword...
...you'll travel the road of
the assassin, with me.
If you choose the ball, I will send
you to be with your mother.
Daigoro... Of course, you
do not yet comprehend...
...what your father is saying...
nor what is about to happen.
But... the Ogami blood in
you will decide for you.
Here... choose.
You must choose...
Daigoro!
You would've been
happier...
...if you'd chosen to join your
mother in her world.
Oh, poor child!
An assassin with
a child, I see.
Do you understand, Daigoro...?
This is our fate!
"Official Order of the Shogunate"
Let it be proclaimed...
"Ogami Itto..."
"Even though you are... the Official
Shogunate Executioner..."
"...you have dared to keep,
in your own shrine..."
"...a death memorial tablet that carried
the emblem of the Shogunate."
"This is undeniably an act of ill-will
towards the Shogunate..."
"...and as such, it shall
not be forgiven."
"You are dismissed from
your position, and..."
"...your House will be abolished.
In conclusion..."
"...you and your son, Daigoro, are hereby
ordered to commit seppuku."
I must commend your having welcomed
us by wearing death robes.
It is so typical of you, Ogami Itto, who
personified the office of Executioner.
You are prepared most
commendably.
I did not wear this
death robe...
...in order to commit
seppuku...
...but rather to...
...proclaim that we, father and son, shall
live as demons from this day on...
These robes are to celebrate
our departure!
How dare you...! Are you disobeying
an Order of the Shogunate?!
Have you lost your mind,
Ogami Itto?!
We, who have chosen to live as demons,
are no longer mere humans.
For us, then, such an
order is... nonsense!
Come out!
Come out!
Come out! Come out!
Can you slay me...? With
your slender arms...
...can you execute
the Executioner?
You fool, how dare you spit upon an
Order of the Shogunate! Kill him!
What are you doing?!
Kill him! Kill him!
Ogami Itto...
Obey the Order of
the Shogunate...
...and commit seppuku
right here and now!
I will be...
...your Second!
We, the Shadow-Yagyu, have
replaced the Ogami's...
...and have obtained the post
of Official Executioner!
Therefore... observing all of the proper
formalities, we shall take your head!
I refuse! You used the most despicable
of tactics to kill my wife...
...and then wrongfully accused me of
treason... I shall have my revenge!
No matter where I choose to go, until
I achieve my revenge, I will not run...
A loser playing at being a hero...
It is an act that is pointless.
Not even your Suiouryu
techniques...
...can stand against the Yagyu's
wall of warriors!
Are you sure?
Itto! How dare you!
For 27 years I have served
this sacred emblem.
You, for 64 years.
As long as every single being in
the more than 60 domains...
...lives under, and honors,
this emblem...
...I cannot yet find it to be
totally without merit.
Observe!
The Yagyu's best men, renowned as
invincible, are now as nothing.
Unless you strike at this
sacred emblem...
...you cannot kill me!
Can you, Retsudo?!
Is not pointing your swords,
while facing...
...the emblem of the Shogunate
considered disrespectful?!
Clear the way!
Wait!
Remove and hand over the robe bearing
the symbol of the Shogunate!
Then, we Yagyu will challenge
you to a fair fight.
If you should win...
...then you may go anywhere you
wish, live wherever you wish...
As long as it is beyond the borders
of the Shogunate's domain...
...we will leave
you in peace.
How about it?
Very well.
Our sentinel carries the
sunshine on his back...
... while Ogami Itto carries
a child on his.
Both men carry
something...
... but the outcome of this challenge
is already determined.
If everything else is equal and fair, he
who has the advantage of ground...
... he who has the advantage of
Nature, shall be the victor!
From high up in the mountain,
if you shit a rocky turd, oh...
It'll be all covered
with sand...
It'll tumble down like a pebble...
It'll tumble down like a pebble...
"From high up in the mountain..."
"...if you shit a rocky
turd, oh..."
"lt'll be all covered
with sand..."
"lt'll tumble down
like a pebble..."
"There goes one!"
"Here goes one!"
Sign: "Gounomori Hot Springs"
Dammit! Oh, shit!
Dammit!
What a rude fellow
he was!
You... You with
the little brat!
Want me to slash this rope so you
fall down like that other guy?
If there's no other bridge
to the Ootawara Road...
...I believe that doing so will
inconvenience you as well.
What nerve!
All right... Cross!
Huh? A Doutanuki Sword...
It won't get a nick, even after
slicing through bone...
...a battle-sword that you can even
use effectively from horseback.
You got a nice piece here,
fellow. I'll keep it for you.
Why did you come
here? Well...?
Must I have a reason
to take a bath?
You've come to bathe,
nothing else?
Are you saying that someone who brings
his child has some other purpose?
You're right... But you
two are unlucky...
...as you've chosen
to bathe in Hell!
All right. Follow me.
One more thing... If you
get any funny ideas...
...you and your brat will
be sliced into pieces!
Help! Someone,
please! Help!
Stop...! Father!
Help!
No...!
Can't show it to
your brat, eh?
I guess that's what they
call fatherly love, eh?
No!
Knock it off! O-kayo!
D... Damn you!
You demons! I'll kill
you! Take this!
Looks like she's
dead, Onibi.
After all, first you grabbed
and squeezed her...
...and then you force-fed
her that giant of yours!
You know...
I didn't try her 'cause I thought she was
too little... but she looks pretty tasty!
Hey... Why did you have to keep
her all to yourself, huh? Huh?
Who the hell's that?
He's come to bathe
with his brat.
He walked in here with a
Doutanuki Sword, but...
...he's as meek as
a house-cat!
It's no wonder he's quiet... He could
do nothing but stand still, after all!
Have we not met somewhere
before?
I'm afraid not.
Your name...?
Even if I told you, it's an old
name I no longer use.
Just answer the
question!
I am a ronin from the western
lands... Oonishi Tahei.
Hmm... Truly, it is a name
I am not familiar with.
The guy had a Doutanuki Sword...
...so I figured he'd be
highly trained...
...but seeing as how he nearly fell
for the old sake-cup trick... Ha!
Listen... If you defy
us in any way...
...l'll throw these dirks straight
into your throats...
...both yours and
your brat's!
Take them to the
bathhouse.
Follow me.
That man is something!
Say what...? Are you telling
me that he fooled me?!
Well, even if he is as strong as you, he can't
do anything if he's got a child with him.
Besides, he doesn't look like a fool who
would go up against this many of us.
All right... I'll find out... just
how much of a man he is!
Don't, Monnosuke...
No! As my man Tanba says, if
that guy is no ordinary guy...
...then that would mean
he's mocked my dirks!
I've got to test him
for real, or else!
Will you come with
me, Tanba?
That man...
...I just know that I've seen
him somewhere before!
I'm sure that you've guessed by now
that we've got prices on our heads.
Don't be stupid enough
to disobey us.
Come out! Show me
what you're made of.
I'm telling you to step out,
so that we can duel.
Are you deaf?!
Why, you...
I guess you don't care what
happens to your brat.
Enough! What kind of a fool would dare
to challenge wanted men like you...?
That'd just be throwing your life away.
That'd just be throwing your life away.
What are you saying?
He may not have a master,
but he's still a samurai.
He's not gonna beg for mercy and say
"I don't wanna die! Please spare me!"
That's why he chooses to close his
eyes like that, don't you get it?
Why won't you leave
him alone?
I see what you're saying.
That does make sense.
For a whore and a bedroom pickpocket,
you do make sense. Eh, Osen?
Ha! And you're nothing
but filthy beasts!
What did you say?
All right. I'll
let him off.
But in exchange, you two must
screw right in front of us!
Right now! Right here!
Let us watch every
moment of it!
Now that sounds
interesting.
On with the show!
On with the show!
No, I won't! Who would?!
It's ridiculous!
It's ridiculous!
I wouldn't mind paying to watch, you know.
Besides, you sell yourself
for a living.
On top of that, you then sneak and
steal money from your clients.
Show us that special technique of yours,
and let us enjoy it to the fullest!
Damn you!
Damn you!
If you dare to defy me...
I'd rather die...
I see. Then,
you die.
Wait...
You can't... You wouldn't...
Don't tell me that you'd...
to save me...
If you don't mind a woman like
me... then I'm all yours.
She looks like a little girl!
She looks like a little girl!
Yeah!
I bet she thinks she's a female buddha,
'cause she spared a soul...
A juicy buddha,
more like.
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha... Merciful...
Merciful Buddha... Merciful...
Will you knock it off, you lousy priest?!
If you chant prayers
at a time like this...
...it makes us feel like
we're already dead!
This is a living hell
in any case.
Before they leave here...
we'll all be killed.
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
We don't know that for sure!
Yeah, everyone else
is hiding indoors...
...but there are scores of people in
this bathhouse village alone!
Nobody can be ruthless enough
to kill that many!
But, the fact is, unlike those
folks, we are travelers.
If they let us live, then their
activities would be known.
If that happens,
then...
R... Right... They'll
kill us for sure!
Damn! So you're saying that we ought
to just sit and wait to be killed?! Shit!
No matter what we do now,
nothing's gonna help!
They are beasts.
Honorable Samurai warriors...
Please do something!
I do not want to die! I do
not want to be killed!
Please save
us! Please!
Enough!
What do you expect
of a sick man?!
It's the same story
with that ronin.
One has to lose all sense of
decency to save oneself.
He has no shame, so he's
a beast like them, but...
...ha! Without fangs,
what use is he?!
Quiet!
Who the hell do you think
you are, anyway?
You're only a yakuza and
a traveling laborer!
Did you know... I tried to bite my
tongue to kill myself earlier.
But, he understood that, so he shamed
himself, and made love to me!
Isn't that sweet?
Just to save a woman
like me...
...he put aside his pride and honor, that
which means everything to a samurai!
Ha! Nonsense!
There's an army of samurai who'll
get it on with cheap whores!
So, don't get airs!
And will that "army of samurai" sacrifice
themselves just to save a whore's life?!
He fucked you just to
save his own ass!
Don't you understand...?
Why don't you ask your little friend...
the one below your belly button!
What the hell do you
mean by that?!
If you were scared out of your
mind... begging for mercy...
...could you make love
right then and there?
Where are you going?
Are you not afraid
of them?
The way I see it... If I am to
die right now, so be it.
A woman like me...
...can only sink deeper into misery
as each year passes by.
"Gounomori:" Forest-in-Countryside.
This hot-spring is named
"Gounomori..."
"Koumori:" Bat.
...but everyone calls
it a "Koumori" Spa.
Can you guess why?
Bats have wings, but
they aren't birds...
...yet, they have fangs,
but they aren't beasts.
Outcasts from society, who
are just like those bats...
...come here in search of even
the tiniest amount of peace...
That's why we call it
the "Koumori" Spa.
But those scum
are different...
They are... beasts
with fangs!
And... you are a
bird with wings.
What are you trying
to say?
You show no fear
of their fangs.
You have wings, and can fly
away from here at will.
I just know it... As one who's passed
from one man's arms to the next...
...I know what kind
of wings you have.
Earlier this summer, at a town where
I was staying, near Takatou castle...
...four high-ranking
samurai were slain.
Whoever did it was supposedly
a ronin with a child.
And the slain samurai were said
to be the best of their Clan.
Their interrogators were very rough,
so I remember all of that well.
The unknown pair were called
the "Lone Wolf and Cub..."
...and were available
for hire...
...as assassins...
...or so the story goes.
By the afternoon of the
day after tomorrow...
...his highness will travel
via the Nikko Road...
...then pass through
here: Jizougahara.
It's within the Shogunate's domain, and
it's an ideal spot to stage an ambush.
There'll be problems if we wait until
they enter the Oyamada domain.
Without fail, they must be killed
right here! Understood?
Very well.
And...? What about
the money?
500 pieces of gold.
The remaining 500... will be
paid upon completion.
We're counting on
you, Kanbei.
There is no room
for failure.
Leave everything
to me.
Say... mind if I check
it out for a bit?
That's what they call a "horseback-
musket," right?
That's what they call a "horseback-
musket," right?
If you've got weapons like that, why
can't you kill them yourselves?!
There would be traceable
evidence.
Besides... we must be at the castle
around the time of the attack.
I see... If you are all "lined up and ready
to serve" at the castle, then...
...there's no way you can ever
be suspected, huh?
Exactly.
It'll be reported that Lord
Noriyuki and his men...
...were attacked by a band of lowly, out-
of-work ronin, and, alas, were slain.
Who, then, will bother
to suspect us?
We may be those lowly ronin, but
you are a bunch of turncoats!
Watch your tongue!
Watch your tongue!
Forget it!
At any rate... you
must not fail.
I understand completely!
Everyone come out!
Come out!
Hurry, or we'll
kill you!
Come out!
Come out!
Come out!
Hurry up!
Everyone... We must thank
you for everything.
We are leaving now.
However... there is something
I must tell you first.
Should any of you say anything about
us... and I mean anything...
...to any officers of
the Shogunate...
You will all die!
Understand...?
Yes, sir.
However... this group
is to die right here.
For two reasons.
If I let you go...
...you will tell somebody, somewhere
along the way...
...and you know what
we look like.
Secondly... you will be an example
to everyone in this village!
Consider yourselves unfortunate...
Your lives are over.
P... Please spare me! Please!
Don't kill me!
We won't ever tell anyone
anything about you!
So please! Please!
I beg you!
Please spare me!
Please spare me!
Please spare me!
Please spare me!
First, the samurai...
you go first.
Pick it up... then,
fight me!
I'll let you die like
a real samurai.
M... Master!
I am prepared.
But... how can we fight, when
I am so weak from illness?!
I will commit seppuku...
...so, at the very least act as my Second!
...so, at the very least act as my Second!
"Second?!"
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
"A Second..."
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha... Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
"Ogamu:" To chant prayers.
"Ogamu..."
"Ogamu..."
Ogami!
The Shogunate's Second!
Ogami Itto!
Where is he?! Where's that
ronin with the child?!
As I thought!
What's the matter?
Wanna kill that fellow
with the brat first?
No, wait... Leave
that man alone!
Let him go!
Say what? What's
wrong with you?
Just... do not attempt to do
anything to that man!
What are you afraid of?! How can you
be scared of a guy like that...?
You fool! Knock it off!
What's so special about
such a coward?!
Monnosuke!
H... How... impossible!
Suiouryu Horse-Slaying
Technique...
I know nothing!
Please spare me! I will
not tell anyone...
...that you were... once the
Shogunate's Second...
...Ogami Itto!
Please spare me!
Why, you... It's
intolerable!
Who are you?
You fool!
Who are you?!
Greetings, I am the assassin
"Lone Wolf and Cub!"
What?!
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
Merciful Buddha...
It's true... the Lone
Wolf and Cub.
Wait!
Wait!
"The End"
