What happened in here?
MARTIN:
I have no idea, man.
Jesus Christ.
Some of them are my friends.
Shit. What did this?
Only thing that makes any sense
is a lion, but...
- cats don't do this, you know?
- What?
Lions don't do this.
I've heard stories, but no lion
that I've ever seen.
Any alive over there?
No.
Oh, shit.
Most of this village
is women and kids, bro.
Think the rest of them
got away? Huh?
I hope so.
Okay, this is... this is bad.
With this much blood,
there should be
hyenas around already.
What does that mean?
It means that
whatever did this is...
Still out there? Huh?
I'm gonna get the gun.
Go get the girls.
Okay. Uh, Mare!

How does that go? All right,
so you know how to use this?
- Uh, no.
- To use that, press that button
only when you're talking,

Baby, are you okay?
I'm okay.
- Norah, you guys are okay?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Yeah.
- What happened?
Well, Banji came along
with some reserve wardens,
- and they found us.
- Banji?
MARE:
Mm-hmm.
I knew I liked that boy.
You led that thing
into their pride land.
Rules of the jungle.
You knew that
the other lions would kill him
to protect their pride.
I was just trying
to save my girls.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
Uncle Martin
would be proud of you.
NORAH: He would have been
proud of you, too.
MARE:
We get to go home soon.
NATE:
Maybe we should come back
for another vacation
with the lion.
- Did it make it? The lion?
- It... No, Dad.
NATE: No, I mean...
No, he-he messed me up.
NORAH:
But we made it out alive.
NATE:
Yes, we did.
- NATE: Mare, you got this?
- (birds chirping)
- MARE: Yes. Dad...
- NATE: Let me see.
- NATE: Can I see, please?
- MARE: No.
- NATE: Come on.
- Guys, come on.
- Mare, do you have it?
- Yes, Norah. Thank you.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Got it?
- Yes.
- Oh, Mom's gonna love it.
- MARE: Wait, Dad. Be careful.
- NORAH: I'm gonna beat you.
MARE:
Please just... be careful.
Okay.
Yeah, this one's for Mom, guys.
- NATE: Whoa!
- (Mare and Norah squeal)
- MARE: Oh, gosh.
- NORAH: Oh, my gosh.
