(Narrator) '''Another clatter''a
'Mad fuck. isn't he? Jim.

Like Bren as well.
'Be nice if somethin' developed
between her and Michael. wouldn't it?
'Or if Michael and Jim resolved
whatever it is occurred in their past.
'Be a bit of symmetry there. yeah?
Closure. whatever.
'But l happen to know
some shit you don't. my friends.
'There's going to be heartbreak
e'er this day is done.
'Brutal and tragic events
are brewin' up righteous.
'So. when they come to pass. man.

'Still and all...
'...bit of craic. yeah?'

So is piss as a matter of fact. Here.
Not that I'm advocatin' its use.

About four years back.

So he stepped in
and gave the dude a beatin'.
Few weeks after.
this fella knocked up to the house.

That's right. And attacked her.
Fucked her up so bad.
she was in hospital for a fuckin' month.
broke her arm. man.
a bunch of her ribs. her nose...
OtaI. that's... That's terriblea
Did hae get done for it?
(Jim) No. he was shot by the guards
about four days after.
Yeah. good riddance.
A post office robbery.
That's really horrible. Jima
lt wasn't your fault. though. Michael.
- You were only doing what you...
- They fuckin' thought it was.
Enough at least l was told
they never wanted to see me again.
l was someone they were better off
no longer havin' in their lives.
- Michael...
- l only done what anyone would've.
l know.
Oh. you ''know''?
Fuckin' four years later?
(Jim) Michael. you know
we tried to make it up.
How many times did we call.
either one or the other?
- And what did he say?
- He never answered.
- He cut us off. man.
- Could you blame me?
No. I couIdn't.
l couldn't.
l understand you were hurt.
But weren't we all?
Michael? Weren't we all?
l mean. l iust thought. if we could.
one last time. the three of us.
just sit around a table. you know?
But fuck it. man. You're right.
It's more than your obligation extends to.
Anyway...we get me coke now?
(Clifford) All right. Michael?
Observe a righteous curlicue. man.
- See? Cos it curls.
- Very good.
Come here.

of the Reaper's.
Fuckin' ''reaper''a
Tell me you don't believe that shit.
No. I don't. But I believe he does.
And l think you owe it to him.
if you don't mind my saying.
And to your mum. and to yourself.
to get over yourself.
- ''Get over myself''?
-'Yes.
And do what he asked you to do.
- Go down?

- A vet. man.
- A vet?
- The best in the fuckin' business.
He is.
You hear me. Michael?
Dawson. The best.
Overhaul you in no time. yeah?
(Michael) He said that this was
where those who lived and died
by the sword were buried.
And in his last few hours
that's certainly what he did.
Anyway...
...no better companions
could he have in death
than Achilles and Apollo. man...
...keep him company on his way to...
...l dunno. Valhalla or somethin'.
- Amen.
- Amen.
What can you say
that his moniker didn't?
- Wotcha think?
- (Russ) Achilles...
- ...feel its texture. its power. it's...
- l think l'm in love with you.
(Michael) What?
- Man. that's the rebound talkin'.
- No. it's not.
...savage yet tender...
(Michael) l love you too. Bren.
(Brenda) Do you?
Crazy love. like. Yes. l do...
...wild yet devoted...
- (Michael) Is your love crazy?
- Yeah. l think it is.
Ah. come on. lads.
We didn't talk over
your fuckin'...eulogy.
Sorry. lads.
ln the haunch.
the power of the jaw...
...the snap...
(Michael) Fuckin' typical.
First thing l have to do is tell her
her husband's dead.
- Hoas the leg?
- Fucked. man.
Fuckin' vet. l swear.
(Brenda) Yeah. well if it wasn't for him.
you'd be jail.
(Michael) Yeah...
Your mum must love this place.
- Can l ask you something?
- Yeah.
Do you think
he was telling the truth?
-Who. me da?
- Yeah.
Do you think he was right.
about the Reaper?
l dunno.
(Narrator) 'Pertinent question. though.
isn't it?
'Cos if Jim's death was indeed foretold.
'then wouldn't that suggest
that we're not alone?
'And that each of us is indeed significant
in this vast and degenerate cosmos?
'l'm sure you'll agree
that's a soothin' fuckin' notion. man.
'A happy notion.
'But what's to become of Michael?
'l mean. is he doomed to remain
the dude he was?
'A perpetual waster.
'forever to be ruled by fear
and confusion and anger?
'Or has he. after all the harrowin' shit
he's endured and overcome.
'come out the other side a better man?
'An enlightened man?
'l'm afraid that's somethin' that
remains to be seen. my friend.
'See. there's certain things
l like to leave obscure and enigmatic.
'And why?
'Cos that's me way. man.
'That's me way#
