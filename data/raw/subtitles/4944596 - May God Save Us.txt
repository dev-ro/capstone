YOUR SON WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU
MADRID SUMMER 2011
POLICE STATION
That was you, right?
Yes.
That's when you started talking.
There, we see the two of you.
And finally they pulled you off of him.
Tell me something.
Have you noticed any change
since that happened?
What?
If you noticed any change. 
It was,
exactly three months ago.
April 29th.
Have you noticed anything?
Like what?
The atmosphere, the people,
I don't know.
Nothing at all?
Well, it's summer, it's hot
and we smell worse, I guess.
Have you gone to see him?
No.
- You've been busy?
- Very.
Are you sorry?
Of course I am. Fiery.
That much?
Yes, and if something like that 
happened again - 
- I'd think first before acting.
We don't want people like you here.
I talked with that guy and told
him everything I told you.
Two months ago.
2 months in therapy and 1 suspended 
without pay.
That's not enough.
Not enough?
No, it isn't.
- We have a new policy now.
- What policy?
I made a mistake and lost control. I've been
seeing a shrink for two months - 
- he gives me pills...
Why were you arguing?
Why were you arguing?
Things happen.
The job wears you out, you know?
Things happen.
You mean losing 85% of vision 
in one eye?
Things like that?
Why were you arguing?
We didn't like each other.
You should have seen him running.
15 yards ahead of him. Like a rabbit.
Pure muscle, pure muscle.
- In full gear?
- No, the spacesuit, helmet, pads.
27,5 kilos racing up Jacinto Benavente.
When he turned towards Atocha,
near the end - 
- he was 7 or 8 meters ahead of him.
And he says: "This punkÂ´s not getting away."
He takes out his baton, aims...
And he throws it at his legs.
- The kid falls face first.
- Exactly.
He catches up, out of breath, 
dripping in sweat - 
- stops in front of the kid
and starts pounding on him.
"What did you say, son of a bitch?"
"Your mother's a fucking whore."
"She had to work all the time
and couldn't raise you right."
So he hears the kid...
His face to the pavement.
No idea what he was saying...
"What? I can't understand you."
"Tell your mother to take those
three dicks out of her mouth - 
- and come talk to me."
He starts bleeding, and this guy goes
for blood like piranhas.
"What the fuck are you saying?"
"I'll see what he's saying."
Like this with his face
in the ground.
He crouches down - 
- Pulls the towel off his head...
- The Palestinian.
And he hears him say...
"Stop, Dad. Stop, Dad."
"Stop, Dad."
It was his son?
That's the story, yeah.
He doesn't know Aliete.
You mean Aliete had to beat him
with all the people in the square...
Dumbass, if it weren't his son
I wouldn't tell the story.
Pay for my drink.
- Quit screwing around.
- No, I've got it...
- You believed all that crap?
- You didn't?
It's not working again.
I'm fucking sick of this.
We said to fix the AC 2 weeks ago.
It kills me.
Do you know if they've checked it?
Two weeks, come on already.
They don't care if we roast in here.
We're going to burn up in here.
Spontaneous combustion.
Javier, what happened?
Shout louder, I can't hear you.
Come over and tell us.
- I can't now, gorgeous.
- Gorgeous, yourself.
Bruises apparent on the neck.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Another Atletico fan?
Sorry, your honor.
- What happened?
- The lady was at home - 
- someone rang the bell. The lady 
went to open it.
Looks like the attacker came to rob her.
The lady defended herself - 
- And she fell down the stairs.
- Name?
- Excuse me?
- What's the lady's name?
Her name is...
Name... Bernarda Gil de Lafuente.
Give the genius some room
so he can get comfy.
- Here we go again.
- The shtick.
Okay, whenever his majesty is ready.
Let me know when he's done.
Yes, sir.
Goodbye, your honor.
Amparo, let's hook up for a drink 
some time.
Sure, anytime.
I'm not hitting on you.
The boss is gone. Can I smoke now?
Careful with the ash.
Was it turned on?
- When we got here, it was off.
- Turn it off.
As you can see, the door was open
but the lock wasn't forced.
Looks like the lady heard the bell.
Went to open the door.
Saw someone wanted to rob her,
tried closing it, but he forced his way in.
He thought her purse would be here,
they struggled on the sofa and...
The lady told him her purse
was in the bedroom.
He came in and she tried to make 
a run for it.
It looks like he chased after her
to stop her from screaming - 
- and she fell down the stairs.
He was so scared he didn't notice.
He thought the money in her purse
was enough.
Finish up?
Velarde.
The coroner's picking up the body.
Let's go.
S... she wearing panties?
Gentlemen, please.
Isn't this a clear case?
Let's see what Velarde says.
Come on, Velarde.
It was a thief with bad luck.
It wasn't a r... robbery.
He r... raped her.
Fuck me.
You'll find tr... traces of 
sp... sperm.
I would never have gone looking 
in there.
That's why I bring him, dummy.
She's been a widow for... 24 years - 
- and didn't have any children.
Do you know if she had - 
- a friend, a boyfriend, or...
Since May, mid-May to be exact - 
- someone came to visit her, a man.
I heard him going up in the elevator
everyday at around 11:00, 11:30.
He'd leave 2 hours later. Sometimes
he came in the evening too.
And how do you know it was a man?
Well, a few Sundays ago.
I went to ask for some eggs - 
- because I was out. I could have gone
to the Chinese shop - 
- but I don't trust those eggs.
- I don't trust the Chinese.
- Me neither.
Then when I went upstairs.
She must have been with someone - 
- because she didn't want to let me in.
And when she went for the eggs.
That's when I saw a man's shoe.
Thank you, ma'am. Much obliged.
- We'll be in touch.
- And a couple of days ago - 
- we had a weird conversation.
Can you elaborate...?
Sure I can.
She told me she was in love.
Like a schoolgirl.
Damn cat!
Ma'am, it's probably upset.
Upset? It wasn't hers.
And besides, Bernarda hated
animals.
She set traps for my Tomasito.
Give me a kiss, cutie.
Give me a kiss.
No one saw or heard anything.
The victim, Bernarda Gil,
is an unpleasant elderly woman - 
- who doesn't talk to anyone,
but somehow - 
- tells her love story to her 
busybody neighbor.
- Th... the flowers.
- I was getting to that.
The boyfriend gets tired of drinking tea
and wants the old lady to show him her panties.
She doesn't want to. He smacks her -
- thinks he killed her, freaks out 
and takes - 
- her purse to fake a robbery.
But he's so nervous he leaves the jewelry.
The old lady is still alive,
gets up to call for help - 
- falls down the stairs
and see you later alligator.
Rape and involuntary manslaughter.
And when you comeback from deep space
we can get back to work.
We have to track down
the link with the victim.
This guy doesn't have a record
and he's scared shitless.
And the cat w... with the bowl of milk?
How should I know?
They were probably watching TV,
the cat snuck in - 
- and this guy fed him.
Right, the old lady didn't like cats.
I don't know.
What else do you have? Come on.
We have to wait for... the DNA.
Three days?
Then I'm leaving.
Working too much is for morons.
You coming?
I have to look for... similarities.
You'll get 3,000 wife beaters.
I'll bet you 20 bucks.
Well?
You owe me 20 bucks.
Nico, stop.
He's going to bite you.
Listen to your mom, melon.
You're the melon, fatso!
What did you say? I'll spank your ass!
Watch out!
How was your day?
Bad?
Is there any yogurt?
I don't know.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Elena, you want some dinner?
- Okay.
Hi.
Hi.
Are you okay?
- Perfect.
- Are you sure?
Cause of death, strong trauma
to the base of the skull.
The injuries to the ribs and legs
are also from the fall.
Arms, wrists and especially neck
all courtesy of the attacker - 
- who has a huge penis, by the way.
And it c...
Couldn't be...
Due to vaginal discharge?
That affected the superficial
lacerations - 
- but the internal disaster was made
by an enormous penis.
- Could it have been something else?
- It was an extremely large penis.
And what else?
Traces of skin under the victim's
fingernails.
- From a struggle?
- Yes.
Forensics found alfa-oxidizing
lotion on the skin.
And what the fuck is that?
A lotion that treats seborrheic
keratosis.
- What the fuck is that?
- A mild skin disease.
Very common among the elderly.
I told you, didn't I? A grandpa stud.
Personal objects from your old lady.
- No prints.
- Thanks, chief.
Anything there?
Theater t... tickets.
Eight Saturdays in a row.
She kept them... like a...
Schoolgirl.
Do you know her?
Maybe with straight hair...
Does she look familiar or not?
Maybe yesterday afternoon...
Don't get your fingers all over it...
A lot of people come in here,
you know?
Yeah, right. Thanks a lot.
Goodbye.
I'm telling you,
these people are something else.
You want a coffee?
Do you want a coffee?
D... do y... you want a 
f...  fucking c... coffee?
Yes, thanks.
Cost me 800 bucks.
- Does it fit in your house?
- Sure it does.
As big as you want, 800 euros.
My friend can get it.
I just want a TV.
- If I want a washing machine...
- Have you got 20 cents?
Excuse me?
I asked if you've got 20 cents.
No, no we don't. Like I was saying - 
- 800 bucks...
- Is very good.
- It's a scam.
- Hey.
How do you know if you didn't look?
Maybe you do.
Well, yeah, maybe we do.
Are you gonna look or not?
No, I'm not gonna look.
- Want me to check for you?
- End of discussion.
- I'll check for you, maybe you'd like it.
- End of discussion.
- Maybe you'd like it.
- End of discussion.
- He's not here.
- Wait, wait, go back.
- That was nothing.
- Put on the other camera.
- We've already seen it.
- I don't give a shit, put it on again.
There. That might be her.
Come on, keep going. That's it.
Keep going...
Fuck you.
Having fun?
For you guys
- Where are you now?
- In the file room all day.
It's a huge mess down there.
- Why?
- The files are out of order.
It's impossible to organize.
That's nothing. Look at this guy.
Did Santa bring you what you wanted?
He doesn't have a record.
Okay, ladies. See you later.
Hey, what's with the pile?
What asshole asked you for that?
Your partner.
He's innocent! Please, leave him alone!
Stop!
- Stop!
- Take it away.
You can't take the body away.
This is my case.
I said no!
This is my case. I handle murders 
with rape.
The case goes to the first
on the scene. Explain it to him - 
- For God's sake.
- This is not the time or the place.
What are you doing?
Get her out of here!
Take her away! Right now!
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of the street.
- Was she raped?
- I don't know, Velarde.
- How could I know right now?
- Useless!
What did you say? What did you say?
I didn't hear you very well.
What did you say?
Useless, he called you useless.
Come on, let's go.
Before things get ugly.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Motherfucker!
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch! I'm okay, I'm okay.
That motherfucker. You belong in jail!
- You belong in jail.
- All right, I'm okay!
What are you doing?
Okay.
Hey, knock it off!
Please, stop it!
- Hey!
- Stop! Stop!
- Please, calm down!
- Stop!
- Now!
- Son of a bitch!
- Son of a bitch!
- That's enough!
- That's enough!
- Get over here, you bastard!
Motherfucker!
- Punk!!
- That's enough!
How can you be so stupid?
Stop it already!
Good morning.
- Like this?
- Yes.
No, your forearm pointing down.
Towards the ground, like that.
I'll run you through it.
The murderer entered with the victim,
Concha Max, 73 years old.
Her son had just dropped her off,
they'd come from a family reunion.
The murderer forced her down here.
No one heard a thing. He strangled her
and hit her head against that beam.
We found traces of blood,
hair and brain tissue.
Where?
- There and there.
- Why...
Isn't it marked?
Because Alonso thought...
Well, you know what he's like.
- Was her purse... missing?
- No.
It was all there, it doesn't look like
a robbery.
Rape?
I don't know.
What do you... think?
Maybe, Velarde, I don't know.
Tell me, was the... kid covered 
in blood?
He was coming home from a party at 7 A.M.
when he found the body.
He thought the woman had fallen,
tried to help her - 
- and when he saw she was dead,
he called the police.
What was he doing... here so late?
He lives here with his family.
Here, look.
Well, and a few others.
Fuck.
It's the same murderer.
- The kid?
- No.
That individual... does not rape 
old ladies.
Raping old ladies.
Look, Velarde. It's hot, 
there's a recession - 
- some weirdo killed the old lady
and that's it.
Okay, it's the same guy.
Why didn't he steal the purse
like last time?
Got...to...
Talk with these people.
How are you?
Good, good.
They do whatever they want.
They can easily fit more than 10 there.
- What do you charge for the room?
- 300 euros.
- For the view, huh?
- It's downtown.
My colleague will come and talk 
with you - 
- about the 300 euros and see what 
he thinks.
Your colleague is probably aware,
I'm surprised you aren't.
- You were home last night?
- Yes.
- Can someone corroborate your story?
- My dog, but he doesn't speak.
Excuse me, Detective. The victim's son.
Try not to leave Madrid for a few days.
- Of course.
- Good.
Detective Alfaro, Detective Velarde.
Rafael Max. I've been waiting for an hour.
We apologize.
We just need to know a few things,
a couple of questions and you can go home.
- You brought your mother here, correct?
- I've already answered that.
I drove my mother home like I do 
every day.
The street was closed for the rally
so she insisted on walking.
Well, we need to know - 
- if your mother had a friend - 
- Around the same age as her.
- A male friend?
Look, I just want to go home
and be with my family.
I completely understand.
It's important that we know if your mother
was seeing someone.
No, she wasn't. She was 73 years old.
She'd been a widow for 8 years.
You should be questioning those scumbags
rather than keep me waiting here - 
- for an hour. Can I ask what 
you're doing?
Looking for... your mother's rapist.
- What did you say?
- Go easy on him, Velarde.
- What did you say?
- Forgive him.
Forgive us, Mr. Max. Forgive us.
I'm sorry.
- Why the fuck did you tell him that?
- You heard him.
- What?
- You look very pretty.
- Can you come on the weekend?
- I don't know.
- Why not?
- It's not up to me, Juana.
Help Nico get in.
Put it back.
No, leave it there. Come on, get in.
Put on your seat belt.
Why don't you ever get any holidays?
Because I have a shitty school.
Empty the washing machine
and turn on the dishwasher.
- Empty and turn on, got it.
- What time are you coming back?
- When everyone else does.
- At 12:30.
Take care of your father
and call me if you need anything.
Drive slowly, okay?
Listen to your mother, melon.
Take care of your daughter, please.
- Have fun.
- Makes sure she studies.
I love you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Careful or you'll end up on the floor.
Just kidding.
Go ahead.
That's okay, I'm not in a hurry.
I'm just about to mop, go ahead.
Don't worry about it.
How was the fall?
Good.
You work here...
- Only at night?
- Here, yes.
I clean another house in the mornings.
My name is Rosario.
Luis.
Nice to meet you.
Goodbye.
What's this still doing here?
No one claimed it.
What?
I'm slammed with work.
Read the report and leave me alone.
I already told Alonso and Bermejo
what I had to say.
Figure it out.
We want to hear it with that pretty 
voice of yours.
- Was she raped?
- Yes.
- And the injuries?
- Not much to tell.
Beaten to death against a beam.
- Similarities with the previous autopsy?
- You tell me.
That's what you get paid for.
If I told you what they pay me...
- Traces of that alpha, beta, gamma lotion?
- Alpha hydroxy.
No.
That doesn't... mean anything.
So we have to wait for the DNA.
I want to see Alonso's and Bermejo's faces
when it's the same guy.
You think it was the same guy?
Two guys raping old ladies
at the same time?
Perfect, Julio, thank you.
Excuse me.
Last night...
I burst into tears.
I was tucking in Lucas and thought
what a shitty world I brought him into.
What would become of him if something
happened to his mother or me?
He looked at me and asked me
if I was hurt.
The poor kid was scared, of course.
- Do you guys have kids?
- Yes, we do.
You know what I'm talking about.
If I can't keep my son safe,
who can?
The banks? The politicians?
The IMF? The UN?
Us, gentlemen, us.
We're the ones who have to stand tall
and endure whatever they throw at us.
Patrol officers.
The riot police killing themselves
working out there.
Special forces, all of them.
But ahead of all of them -
- it's you guys.
Homicide.
And ahead of the four of you - 
- it's me.
But I can't do it alone.
I need you.
I need you guys.
Raping old ladies!
- What have we got?
- Not much.
A man with a very bad temper
is what we've got.
Whose case is it?
- Ours.
- Yours, good, yours.
But we're together in this.
I'm with you guys.
Alonso and Bermejo are with 
you guys too.
No more bullshit about who has 
the biggest cock.
The five of us are going to solve this
and nothing happened here.
And with that fucking Pope
coming to visit - 
- we can't afford this right now.
Absolute discretion, gentlemen.
I don't want to bump into some jerk
at the coffee machine - 
- talking about how we found
some old lady with her legs open.
I'm only going to say this once.
Nobody is raping old ladies.
Velarde.
Clear?
That's how it's going to be.
Why aren't we eating?
It's getting cold, come on,
it's a delicacy.
Damn, why all the mystery?
- They asked for discretion. Rubio, Velarde.
- Nice to meet you.
I heard you had a mess, right?
Still jerking off or what?
No, I'm seeing Lucia Ramos.
I think you know her.
- You're fucking Lucia?
- Yeah, we're moving in together next month.
You prick, she was my girlfriend
at the academy.
- Can we get to work?
- Yeah, yeah.
Trauma with an older woman,
maybe in childhood.
His mother, grandmother,
nun at a school - 
- or his wife, his mother in law...
- Or his aunt.
- The extra large penis
could have been a problem
in his teens.
He was ashamed, now it's become 
a symbol - 
- of his revenge by returning
the pain women inflicted on him.
- I should call Lucia...
- The first woman
died by accident.
But he brutalized the second one.
Rape isn't enough anymore,
he started to enjoy killing.
Wait a minute. That doesn't make sense.
Alfaro, what's up?
You want me to leave?
- Go back to Lucia...
- If you know everything already...
What else?
The killer is cruel to his victims
because he's an authority - 
- but he's compassionate to weaker beings.
Children, dogs, cats, pets...
He's compassionate, right?
I got it. He's compassionate.
What are you laughing at?
Let's go.
I just wrote the profile - 
- and added stuff like the pets.
- Where are you going?
- Oh, sorry. Discretion.
What a load of crap.
What a waste of time...
His breath smells awful.
Brush your fucking teeth.
Tell me something I don't already know.
He was right about the... cat.
Luck.
It's late, isn't it?
Hello.
I brought you this.
Gazpacho.
It was kind of my fault you slipped.
Well...
So...
- So, bye.
- Would you like to... come in?
No, thank you.
I've already eaten.
Is it good?
When I'm cleaning, I can hear 
your music in the hallway.
It's very sad.
What is she saying?
- In this song?
- I don't know.
Wait...
Hey. No, I mean it.
I mean it. Stop, damn it!
MAN ARRESTED IN MALAGA
FOR KIDNAPPING
Fuck.
No, don't go there.
I mean it, fuck you.
Fuck you.
Because you're a fucking liar
and lied to me twice already, okay?
Hold on.
- What are you doing there?
- Nothing
- Hang on, don't hang up.
- What's up?
- I'm on the phone.
- Yeah, but what's going on?
Go away, you're bothering me.
I'm on the phone! Go to hell!
National press, local, free press,
nothing.
Not one damn reference.
It's fucking strange.
There's always someone
who leaks it.
A journalist, a neighbor, whoever.
But not this time, I don't know
what the fuck is going on.
Come and see this.
Look at this.
I put the old lady's name in.
Nothing at all.
Not even with the initials.
There's one... incomplete.
Guess... who signed it?
What a fucking idiot.
What the hell is that, Velarde?
We can go straight to the disciplinary 
committee.
Well...
That's where your big friends are, right?
An old lady was... murdered.
It wasn't a murder.
It was a heart attack.
The purse was missing.
Everything points to robbery,
a junkie wanders in and bam.
The woman is scared to death.
I was slammed with work - 
- and closed the case. Two days later,
a forensics report appeared - 
- and yes, she was raped.
She didn't have any family - 
- and no one gave a shit about her.
Except some distant niece who 
showed up for the inheritance - 
- Bla, bla, bla...
- And you stuck the report up your ass.
No, no. It wasn't like that.
I stuck it up your wife's ass
and she loved it.
What's... missing in that report?
Everything. But that was months ago.
Well, think.
- It was downtown.
- We already know.
More like... Carretas.
I don't remember what I ate last night,
how will I remember a fucking report?
Are you a cop or what? Come on, think.
- We didn't find it in the apartment.
- Whose was it?
Well, the apartment was hers.
But she rented it out.
That's why it was almost empty.
She lived in another apartment
of hers in the Salamanca district.
What was the rape like?
Brutal.
The poor lady was a wreck.
And if you're going to ask me
if we have her fucking DNA - 
- We don't.
- Good police work.
- Good job.
- Let's go.
You like imagining old ladies 
getting ripped apart, huh?
I like imagining Sancho when
he hears about all this.
You think Sancho doesn't know?
Come on, don't get yourself
into trouble again.
Go on.
This way, please.
Since she had no children,
the flat went to a distant niece.
This one and the other one.
Damn, it's hot in here.
No hurry to sell. No one's been 
to see it in six months.
And this?
Oh yeah. The lady rented it out,
but never came...
A year before she died, she stopped
renting it and started coming.
- She moved in?
- No, no.
She'd only come in the morning,
to watch TV, I guess.
She came alone?
Yes.
Did you ever notice an elderly man 
go in - 
- right before or after she was here?
There are two hostals in the building,
so there's no way to know.
Would you have the address
of her other house?
Not on me, but I'll get it from
the office.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Detective Velarde, Detective Alfaro.
We'd like to ask you some questions
about the previous tenant.
- Antonia Alvarez. You're her niece?
- Yes, I am.
Lovely child. How old is it?
- Please.
- Okay.
Can we come in for a moment, please?
Do you have a warrant?
No, we just want to ask you
a couple of things, then we'll leave.
What things?
- Has anyone asked about your aunt?
- No.
- Are you still getting her mail?
- No, just some bills.
- And at home, is there...?
- No, nothing.
- All right.
- What was your aunt like?
Kind, not too bright.
Praying in church all day, I don't know.
Can you tell me why
we can't step inside?
First of all, you don't have a warrant.
The police put my boyfriend
in the hospital for going to a rally.
- And I don't want you coming into our house.
- That has nothing to do with us.
O.K.
Which... church... please?
What do you mean by very religious?
Well, coming to mass every day - 
- donating money to the church - 
- and going to confession
at least once a week.
She had no children and wasn't married.
That's right.
Do you know if she was in a 
relationship, or...
How would I know something
like that?
Well, weekly confessions mean
lots of hours of chit chat.
Wasn't poor Antonia attacked
by a young drug addict?
Answer my question.
I never knew of anyone.
And that would have surprised me.
But she had acquaintances,
friends...
Antonia was a beloved woman.
The people closest to her are
the four girlfriends she grew up with.
Where can we find them?
Every day after mass
they go to Piero for a snack.
A cafÃ©, 5 minutes from here.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Would you mind if the ladies
kept thinking Antonia
died accidentally?
The young drug addict?
If it's not too much to ask.
- A boyfriend called you?
- That's very strange.
Antonia never had a boyfriend.
Maybe she had one but didn't tell 
anyone.
Antonia was incapable of lying.
Did you notice anything strange - 
- or any change the months before 
she died?
Yes, she didn't come a lot.
She had problems in the apartment 
on Carretas.
- What kind of problems?
- With some students.
- They were trashing the place.
- They gave her a lot of trouble.
And she was so nice.
She never complained.
- She seemed so happy.
- Yes.
- So there was a change.
- Yes.
She was more cheerful.
Yes.
What's the man's name?
We might know him.
We can't tell you, it's confidential.
Who would we ever tell?
- I know, but we can't, I'm sorry.
- Poor thing.
Remember Antonia?
Oh, yes.
Of course she does. Look, she's smiling.
What a pity.
Look, it's time.
Time flies when you have men
in front of you.
Be quiet!
Don't listen to her.
If you need any information - 
- we're here every afternoon.
- Goodbye.
- Good afternoon.
Nice meeting you. God be with you.
They ate every crumb.
Okay, let's go.
Antonia Alvarez was the first, right?
Possibly.
They clearly had a relationship.
He wanted to mambo, she didn't.
He smacks her, she gets scared,
has a heart attack...
He gets nervous and steals her wallet.
But, thanks to our friend Alonso - 
- the crime isn't covered
by the media.
The killer calms down - 
- and does it again 6 months later.
- The second victim.
- Exactly.
But this time he's not nervous,
he feeds the cat...
He checks the papers. Nothing.
Killing is easy, right?
I knock someone off - 
- and nobody finds out.
So with the third, Concha Max,
he does it again - 
- and totally brutalizes her.
The next day he checks the papers,
Internet - 
- absolutely nothing.
The next one will be... very soon.
Thanks to who?
Thanks to the police force.
In this neighborhood - 
- the bastard is screwed - 
- because the old ladies
come with Filipinos.
That's why he goes downtown.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Piece of cake.
You're right.
I'm the only schmuck without a 
vacation this year.
Give the melon a kiss
and another for you.
I love you. Bye.
How's your woman situation?
Have you got one?
I don't know how you can take
this heat.
I haven't been home in 2 weeks
and I'm ready to burst.
Get... a hooker.
You know... plenty.
Let's go, my treat.
Come on.
You were going to say yes!
What a homo.
I saw you coming.
If we could catch this guy today - 
- but you'd never have sex again,
what would you say?
We'll catch him tomorrow
and get laid first.
What if the hookers are Francisco 
and his friend?
You'd be all over that.
Come on, we've been sitting here
all day - 
- like idiots. Come on, let's go.
I'll buy you a drink.
My treat.
I have to go.
Some other time.
It's too much for her to think about.
Now she's with her mother
and sisters - 
- greeting the Pope-mobile.
I said to her: "In this heat?"
Damn, the Pollack.
Good to see you guys.
How are things?
- You guys miss me?
- Yeah.
- Hey, there.
- How are you, boss?
- How are things?
- Fine.
I'm almost ready to come back.
I'm going downstairs.
If you're upset, go home.
What did you say?
What did you say?
Answer me when I talk to you.
With respect. Like I talk to you, got it?
I don't care if you stutter.
I don't care if you had a difficult 
childhood.
Answer me when I talk to you,
you got that?
Yes or no?
Good.
She was feeding a cat.
Then someone rang.
What did they say to open?
I didn't hear.
- Who calls?
- Police, please open the door.
Fucking old lady.
- He!!o.
- Coupon delivery.
He wasn't old.
30, maybe 35.
Dark hair, thin and what else.
Five feet... five inches.
One takes the elevator, the other
the stairs to check each landing.
Where are you going?
Take the stairs and use
that golden mouth of yours.
Go on.
Here, young man. Your glass of water.
Ma'am, come here.
Police. Go inside and don't come out
until I say.
Police, go inside.
Okay.
Are you okay?
Alfaro, Homicide.
I need backup. Arenal with Opera.
Suspect on the run!
On foot!
Police!
Shut this place down!
Nobody comes in or out!
Police! Everyone in the corner!
Let's go!
Everyone in the corner! Everyone!
- Let's go!
- Hey, don't touch me!
Move it!
Police! Let's go!
Come on!
Male, between 20 and 40 years old.
Very dangerous. Light shirt, dark pants.
Stop anyone who fits the description.
I won't say it again!
Everyone in the corner!
I won't say it again!
Close all the exits and stop all 
the trains.
Exits and trains! Now!
Come on, move it!
Everyone in the left corner.
Sesmillo, read.
96 civil lawsuits - 
- against the police, 21 treated
by paramedics, 2 cervical injuries.
567.000 euros in losses,
complaints from 7 embassies - 
- and a man with a fractured hip.
- We'll take responsibility but we got him.
- No, Alfaro, we don't.
You want to know what we've got?
Sesmillo, read.
- Are you deaf?
- No.
Then read.
96 civil lawsuits - 
- against the police - 
- 21 treated by paramedics - 
- 2 cervical injuries, 567.000 euros
in losses...
Where are... the detainees?
What the fuck did you say?
It's not a rhetorical question,
I didn't understand what you said.
Can you say it again?
Where are the detainees?
Now I understood.
You want me to tell the joint 
operational director - 
- that we're going to retain
103 people - 
- until your nose stops bleeding
and you can interrogate them?
And we can check out their 103 alibis?
I'm just asking.
Is that what you want me to tell him - 
- since with that constant annoying 
stutter - 
- you can't talk like a normal person?
Tell me, is that it?
Look...
Do you want to tell him?
Or should I not answer,
like I've been doing for 45 minutes.
Okay, Sancho, but we had him.
No, you had 23 travelers - 
- recently arrived from France,
Germany, Italy, the U.S., Venezuela
and the fucking Dominican Republic.
That's what you had.
He'll kill again and soon
because we caught up to him,
what matters is he's under control.
And you save your ass. Son of a bitch!
Sesmillo, say it back to him.
According to the disciplinary
commission,
you're fucking fired.
Do what you want, but I don't want
to see you here again.
Because of what some jerk
on the commission said?
Not some jerk.
90% of the police station,
including your partner.
Page 3, in yellow.
I'd send you home too.
But I think you'd kill yourself,
and I don't want that on my conscience.
At least he has a pretty wife
and 2 normal kids.
We'll find something to do
with a detective of your category.
Yeah, go ahead.
- Why can't I stay home?
- You're too young.
Because I said so.
Unbelievable.
I should have stayed at Laura's.
You're coming with your dad,
your brother and your mother.
Let's go.
Where is my son?
They're all at the lake. Javi.
Take it easy, okay?
Take it easy.
Elena is here.
Don't do anything.
Can I help you?
Open up.
Which apartment do you live in?
What's your name?
Javier Alfaro.
Come on, open up.
Hey.
I've been listening to your dog bark
for two days.
If you weren't on vacation,
they would have fined you.
Are you feeling all right?
Great.
Colonel!
Colonel!
Colonel... Colonel!
Colonel...
Evening, sir.
Can we ask what you're doing?
Digging a tunnel to escape,
what do you think?
You can't dig here.
This is private property.
I'm one of you, damn it.
Javier Alfaro, 8627.
I'll go check it out.
Don't let him go anywhere.
Sir, you can't bury your dog here.
Just let us take the dog
and you can sleep it off.
Well?
Are you listening?
Stay away from my dog!
I won't say it again.
Back off.
I just want to bury...
I want to bury my dog!
You son of a bitch!
Show some respect!
Fucker...
Get off me!
It's my dog!
Motherfuckers!
Okay, okay.
Okay, that's enough.
Motherfuckers...
Yes...
I'm leaving.
We're not done yet.
Did they mention my thing?
Velarde, what are you doing here?
Well...
He's in the office,
last door on the left. Hey.
Have you heard from Alfaro?
I tried calling him...
Can you come with me for a second?
As you can see, this is definiteiy -
- becoming a little too much for us.
Velarde, you were closest to this
from the start and you were - 
- right all along, so if you want
to help us out...
You'd leave Surveillance. We'd give 
you all the reports. Meet with us - 
- whenever you want.
We ask for your discretion because - 
- you'd still officially be working
Surveillance.
Cam and Berna saw me.
As long as nobody upstairs sees you.
You'd run the operation,
but nobody would know.
- What about Sancho?
- Sancho, well...
It was Sancho's,
but he doesn't want you to know.
It's a mutual favor,
you help us with the case - 
- and he takes you off Surveillance.
Velarde.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Looking for something?
I already took care of it.
There's food in the fridge.
From the 3 crime scenes?
And all the same... size.
Either his hair doesn't grow
or he gets it cut once a week.
- He's vain.
- It makes sense, he's a seducer.
He uses his physique to convince
his victims. What doesn't fit...
Stabbing the sexual organs
with a knife is a phallic symbol.
He wants to kill femininity.
He has a hard time - 
- with it because he likes it, 
but he hates it.
The mother. I'm convinced that...
everything starts there.
Every time he kills,
he's killing his mother.
He may have... already killed her.
Let's see: Dolores Volado,
two daughters.
The first victim, 6 months ago,
Antonia Alvarez, no kids.
Bernarda Gil didn't either.
And the third,
Concha Max, has 2 sons.
- We talked to Rafael Max.
- And?
Unlikely.
And the other one?
Santiago... doesn't live in Madrid.
We're looking for him.
It's thrilling, Velarde.
Hey, I'll go buy some beers and 
we'll keep talking about the case.
You should go.
I'm sorry to have to ask you here.
I could have gone to the police station.
When was the last time you saw 
your brother?
Who knows where he is.
If you help me, we'll finish sooner.
I have to...
I haven't seen my brother for years.
He had a drug problem, he left
and nobody bothered to look for him.
Not even your mother?
My poor mother had enough on her plate.
Santi gave her a hard time
since he was little.
She didn't get along with him?
He made her life hell whenever he could.
And I guess she did the same to him.
Just as well they threw those scumbags 
out of here.
Does your brother know...
his mother is dead?
I called him but didn't get him.
How do you think... he would react?
I don't know. Badly, probably.
I don't know.
- They hated each other?
- No, I said they didn't get along.
Like any Catholic mother
with a drug addict son.
You think he'd be happy?
I don't have the pleasure...
of knowing your brother.
Do you think my brother
killed my mother?
We can't rule out any... possibilities.
- Yes?
- Velarde, we checked the file -
- and found something odd.
The other son's alibi -
- was that he dropped off his mother
outside because he couldn't park -
- but he got a parking ticket
that same night.
I see.
He has to be lying to us.
We're going to question him tomorrow.
- Good...
- What are you saying? Velarde...
You said that...
You dropped off your mother
that night and went home, right?
That's right.
How is it possible...
That you got a parking ticket...
Nearby?
Okay.
I didn't want to lose my wife
and mother the same day.
You understand, right?
The lover... excuse... is very old.
What is it?
You have to come with me...
to the station.
- To the station? Why, what's wrong?
- Stay where you are!
First you suspect my brother,
now you suspect me.
You're not very clear about things
are you?
Pick up your gun.
We talked to his lover.
It all checks out.
Velarde, her son Rafael
is as clean as a whistle.
We talked to his lover. His male lover.
And it all checks out.
That explains all the mystery.
You okay?
Father.
Today we pray for all of those
remembering their loved ones.
Like our sister, Antonia Alvarez,
who died exactly 7 months ago.
With the hope that we may be
close to you.
We ask you for Jesus Christ,
our Lord.
Think not of our sins,
but of our faith in your church.
Grant us peace and unity
with your word.
You who reign for all centuries, amen.
- Peace be with you.
- And with your spirit.
You may offer peace.
Lamb of God...
You who remove sin from the world,
take pity on us.
Lamb of God...
You who remove sin from the world,
take pity on us.
Lamb of God...
You who remove sin from the world,
give us peace.
- Here you are.
- These snails are tasty.
- Very tasty.
- Delicious.
- They're delicious.
- Enjoy.
- Thank you, Andres.
- Bye, darling.
- Afternoon, ladies.
- Good afternoon.
- Lorna, remember to stop at the pharmacy.
- Yes, young man.
See you later.
Here.
You have to force her more,
or it's impossible.
After that he saw his mother 
differently.
A more human, simple angle but
more honest and delicate as well.
It was a strange sensation that
overwhelmed him in her presence.
Like their hearts were beating
together in unison.
A sense of parallelism
and mutual necessity...
If I find out you're mistreating my mother,
you'll never come back here.
He's definitely...
Between 30... and 35 years old.
Caucasian.
Medium height and weight,
has contact with elderly people.
Traumatic relationship with his mother.
What's this?
Him and me.
For sure.
Do you know how he finds them?
He attacks downtown,
but lives somewhere else,
separating his crimes from his routine.
Traumatic experience with his
mother. A strong woman - 
with a powerful role that brought on
his love-hate relationship with old ladies.
Upper middle class. Conceited. 
Knows his appearance is key to courtship.
Impatient and sadistic.
He thinks he's unstoppable.
In good shape physically.
He has no trouble with normal contact,
but does with intimacy.
When he rapes and murders
old ladies, he's doing it -
- to his mother, but he's never 
touched her.
There's really nobody
who can help you?
Neighbors help me out sometimes.
- Your husband...
- He died 2 years ago.
Wow, I'm sorry.
That's life, you know.
Husbands always die first.
- No boyfriend?
- A boyfriend at my age?
How silly! This is it.
You must have been gorgeous.
I'll leave the cart here.
Thank you very much.
- What was your name?
- Esperanza.
Run along, now. I'm sure you have 
plenty to do.
Wait.
It's heavy.
Still a lot of pep in you.
Pep? I can hardly walk.
You look great.
You don't have an elevator?
42 years climbing the stairs.
You're a spring chicken.
And you're a sweet-talker.
If I help you will you invite me
to a glass of water? With this heat...
Then I'll pick up my girlfriend,
she's waiting for me.
Never keep a woman waiting, because...
Which apartment?
Third, on the left.
- I left it up there for you.
- Thank you.
Esperanza, I'm Andres.
Have a good day.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Please!
No, please...
Please...
No, please...
Please, please...
Can we go to the apartment?
No.
Today's impossible.
- Why?
- With him?
Sancho would be all over us.
If all four of us go, it has to be
very early, and you're out
by 8 A.M. Okay?
- Okay.
- You sure?
- Let's go.
- Right.
- Thanks for the beer.
- Bye.
Get some rest, if you can.
We won't catch him until he screws up.
How many victims now?
Five.
The last one... yesterday.
And the first was... Antonia Alvarez.
The one on... Carretas,
the one with two...
Apartments.
The only one who didn't live
downtown, and he knew her.
Tomorrow we should go to the Salamanca 
district and talk to old ladies.
What?
Nothing.
What's wrong?
Imagine he's right... in front of you.
What would you do?
You know what I would do.
What would you do?
You don't know, do you?
Well, Velarde.
I'm off.
See you tomorrow.
Alfaro.
Forgive me.
You're...
A good cop.
No, I'm not.
But thanks, champ.
Javier, I can see you.
You like spying on people?
How long have you known I smoke?
You think cops are stupid or what?
Go ahead, take one.
Go on.
If I'm bothering you, I'll leave.
No, no...
I talked to Mom before.
She asked if she can come back.
I want them to come back.
But not if it's going to be a problem.
Anyway...
I don't know if you're ready
for that.
I want them back.
Then you're...
You're okay enough to talk to her?
We'd need to get a new dog.
I'm here.
Want me to read to you?
Okay, I'm not going anywhere.
I'll stay here until you fall asleep,
okay?
You know howl know you've slept well?
When I come in the morning and
the first thing you do is smile at me.
What?
Tell me what's wrong.
Is it your throat?
Yeah, I sent it to be fixed.
The clasp was loose.
Now go to sleep.
Mom, it's late. Go to sleep now.
Since when do you get anywhere first?
I'm settling down.
- And your girlfriend?
- She had to go by the station.
- Where's yours?
- She won't answer her phone.
- Give me the keys.
- Wait for me to park.
- I'll wait for you upstairs.
- No.
We all go up together.
Then park already, damn it.
To hell with it.
Answer the damn phone already.
Answer the fucking phone.
Alfaro!
You couldn't wait, you bastard?
Alfaro!
Where the fuck are you, damn it?
I'm very sorry, Velarde.
Did you... find anything?
No. If the bastard went back for it,
he took it with him.
And Bermejo didn't see anything?
30 seconds sooner and I had him.
You had him and he vanished.
It's just...
IÂ´m very, very sorry.
We're shocked.
We'll do a tribute for him - 
- and obviously won't mention
his suspension.
- Thanks.
- It never happened.
If you want to write something,
anything you need.
What I do have to ask is...
Well, you know.
I'm sorry.
You're his partner, right?
He talked a lot about you.
Are those...
His personal objects?
Yes.
All of them?
That's not.
What?
The chain.
May I?
Father! Father!
- Excuse me, would you mind...?
- Is this from here?
They're given to each boy
who takes his communion with us.
Do you know who it belongs to?
Impossible, it's from '87.
I wasn't here.
How many boys took communion?
- I can't say right now.
- There must be a record.
Something.
I'm sorry, he says it's very important.
Father, Detective Velarde.
It's serious.
He needs certain information.
I told him it's from our church - 
- and belongs to one of the boys
who took communion with us.
1987.
Since you were there...
Do you remember anything
or is there a record?
I need to know... whose it is.
And you need to know - 
- between 2 and 2:30 in the afternoon?
Comeback later, please.
- We're having lunch.
- Your maid...
Are all of her papers in order?
He'd have dark hair, under 5'11 - 
- and with an athletic body.
The other thing. Tell him.
He probably had a special - 
- relationship with his mother.
Andres Bosque,
he took communion in '87.
Amaya Martinez.
- What?
- That's his mother.
She taught me grammar
and literature..
What's she doing here?
She taught catechism class that year.
And?
In the case of Andres Bosque
and his mother,
a special relationship - 
- is putting it mildly.
Father Raul, would you like to tell him
or shall I?
You think he also...
It was...
To not leave her alone.
Velarde.
He won't kill again.
Wanna bet?
Javier Alfaro was a great police officer.
But Javier was especially an example - 
- in difficult times for this city.
I remember perfectly the last time - 
- I was in the same room as Javier - 
- and I saw no fear in his eyes.
I saw warmth and passion.
3 YEARS LATER
What are you doing for lunch?
- I don't know.
- I get off in 5 minutes.
Thanks.
I'm in a hurry.
Don't worry about it.
Excuse me.
Do you know if there's a bus stop nearby?
I don't know.
Try that way.
It doesn't look like it.
I really have no idea.
Are you going to town...
at some point?
Yeah, in a while.
Can you... take me? I'm not in a hurry.
Thanks.
Careful.
What are you... a technician?
A doctor told me it would just go away.
But there you have it.
Doctors.
I thought you're born with it.
Mine came suddenly.
From a beating my mother gave me.
Women can't stand it.
I had a girlfriend who couldn't stand it.
She didn't tell me, but I know.
Not from around here?
You're not from around here.
I can tell. I know you from somewhere.
I don't know.
- From Madrid?
- No.
What's your name?
You ask a lot of questions.
That's all you've done since you got in.
We'd better get going. It's getting late.
You have no idea how hard it is
to find a collection like that.
Let's stop...
Hurting people...
Andres.
I stopped.
I swear.
I stopped hurting people. I swear.
MAY GOD SAVE US
