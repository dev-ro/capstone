Thank you very much for attending
this meeting at such a short notice.
This year, both, our illegal and
legal businesses have been successful.
Therefore l was happy...
... only till yesterday.
y esterday, one of
my ships was seized.
And one of us.... is responsible
for it!
He, therefore, has no right
to be amongst us!
- The police have become too alert!
- lnspector Arjun Joglekar...
- ...is very smart and brave.
- No!
ln fact you are absolutely
useless and foolish!
Look, don't you talk to
me like that!
brother! brother!
you have killed my brother!
brother!
Don't cry.
This is part of our profession.
Don't cry.
Consider me to be
your elder brother.
Who is this Arjun Joglekar?!
He often comes to our hotel, sir.
And keeps inquiring from Mona too.
Good Lord! How many times have l
told you to knock before coming in.
Do you know why my father
named me Goli ' (bullet)?
because l reach before
any other bullet.
What was that inspector
asking you?
- y ou are so suspicious.
- What do l do, darling?
As a child l had vitamin pills.
Pills to overcome deficiency, but
no pills to overcome suspicion.
- What was that inspector asking you?
- oh, nothing!
After the dance, some people were
misbehaving with me...
... so he set them right.
And yes...
...he told me that l can call him
whenever l need his help.
Here's what you will do, darling.
Call him over tonight.
And give this small gift
on my behalf.
Happy birthday, brother Arjun!
Come on, out with the money.
- What for?
- Do as l say!
- How much do you want?
- Give me.
Strange! My birthday,
and l've got to pay up!
Chutki, what will you
do with all this money?
y es! Tell me?
l'll get a gift for him.
Meaning, you'll buy a gift
for me, with my own money?
What has the world come to!
How much is it?
- brother, this is Karan here.
- oh, Karan!
- Congratulations to you too.
- lt's brother Karan!
How forgetful l am. What happened
about that investigation?
okay, first talk to Chutki.
Hi, brother Karan!
How are you, Shivangi?
- l'm fine!
but you were supposed to
be back in two days?
There's a lot of work.
l'm coming tomorrow.
Really? See you tomorrow.
Karan, let me give you
another good news.
y ou're soon getting a promotion.
From inspector Karan, you will
become uncle Karan.
- Sister-in-law?!
- y es.
- This calls for a grand party!
- Come over first.
We'll celebrate in such a way that
it'll be a memorable event.
So let's cut the cake.
- l'll eat Karan's share too.
- Eat my share too.
This is Mona here, lnspector.
y es, what is it?
Come over. l want to
tell you something.
Perhaps my life is in danger.
Look, don't you worry.
l'll be right there.
The door is open, inspector.
Please come in.
Come in.
y ou sounded scared on the phone.
y ou said your life is in danger.
- but you are...
- Right now it isn't....
...but if you don't support us...
- lt could be.
- Meaning?
l mean this bag.
- What does it contain?
- See for yourself.
What's this?
This is small gift on behalf of
my master. Please accept it.
lf l want, l can arrest you
for bribing a police officer.
but then, l think you're a
spoilt brat from a rich family.
And yes. Convey my message
to your lover and master.
Soon, he will be behind bars.
What... what have you done?!
y ou've killed him?!
Why did you do this?!
And you didn't even tell me...
...that you'd kill him
if he didn't accept the bribe?!
lt's the rule of our profession.
Kill the one who does not
acquiesce to our demands.
because l don't have time to
talk to him.
Put this bundle of note
in his pocket.
So that he is accused of
taking bribes.
Come soon. We'll celebrate in such a
way that it'll be a memorable event.
l know nothing! l'm only a
dancer in hotel Moonlight!
And from the past two days,
l haven't been home either!
Please believe me.
y ou know nothing?
Nothing?
Why were you leaving
the country that night?
l don't know.
We caught you at the airport.
y et you know nothing.
y ou are lying!
Do you realize what you have done?
y ou are responsible for three deaths!
y ou want to see?!
Do you?!
Come on!
- Leave me!
- This is my sister-in-law!
She is now a widow
because of you!
The child in her womb will be
called an orphan before he's born!
He became an orphan only
because of you!
This....this....
...this innocent sister of mine.
lt was her brother's
birthday yesterday!
And today he is no more.
And you are responsible for it!
Arjun Joglekar was a symbol
of righteousness and integrity!
Who sacrificed his life for
his duties.
And whom the entire department
should have been proud of!
but today, they abhor the very
mention of his name. y ou know why?
on account of your people, he was
accused of taking bribe!
And you are responsible for it!
- No!
- y es, only because of you.
Stop it!
l didn't kill your brother!
And neither have l made your
sister-in-law a widow!
And neither have l ruined your
sister's happiness!
Then who is it?
Who is responsible for it?!
y ou want to know who killed
your brother and why?
l'll tell you everything.
y ou very well know.
Relations, love and sentiments...
have no meaning in our profession.
Even if it is Mona for that matter.
What happened?
What are you thinking about?
Scared?
No.
What should l be scared of?
l was thinking about your brother.
What a noble and decent
human being he was.
y ou know, one day, he told me
to leave Goli and his accomplice.
Had l listened to him... all
this wouldn't have happened.
He was right.
Perhaps that's how the world is.
Honest people are always
done to death.
They are here, Karan!
Run, Mona! Faster!
Faster, Mona!
l can't run.
My skirt!
Get in.
No!
Sir, l want an arrest warrant
against Goli and his gang.
- What for?
- What for?!
He killed my brother!
Killed Mona!
And you still ask me what for?
What evidence do you have that he
is behind all these killings?
- Strange, my sir....
- Ramlal, will you shut up?!
- Ramlal, wait.
- He's shouting at me.
Sir, will you give me the
arrest warrant or not?
Don't be childish.
The ones you want to arrest are
no ordinary people.
They have lawyers and barristers!
And won't the judge ask me for
what crime l want to arrest them?
- y ou won't give the arrest warrant?
- No way!
- Sure?!
- Positive!
- Here's my resignation then.
- And mine too.
- Here it is.
- Mine too.
Just a minute.
- What is it, sir?
- Why do you always do this?
lf l don't do as you say,
you submit your resignation!
y ou do such a thing.
Why should l? This is your house,
not your police station.
Neither are you a D.C.P nor am l a
constable. l'm your elder brother.
l'm ten minutes elder to you.
How many minutes?
Answer me.
What do l do with him?
Look, Karan. Getting involved with
such criminals is like...
...walking straight
into a lion's lair.
lf you want to defeat them,
then there is only one way.
Don't let your heart rule your mind.
Certainly, victory will be yours.
Didn't l tell you, Mohini?!
lf you meet this boy again,
l won't spare him!
- He is my biggest foe!
- but he is my love, my life!
before killing him,
you have to kill me, daddy!
l had sworn not to spare him!
And now...
No!
What have you done, Mohini?
Sacrificed your life for my sake?!
No, Mohini!
y ou can't die! We have sworn
to live and die together!
l'm coming with you, Mohini!
Wait for me!
Wow, Deepak.
What a performance!
Marvelous!
- Mr. Director! What a film!
- y ou are great!
Deepak, the shooting begins
in half an hour.
l don't want to shoot!
- l'm going home!
- This is Damodar bhai's film!
l don't care!
l'm going home!
- Damodar bhai will be very angry.
- Wonder what he will do?
- y es, Rosy.
- This is Damodar here.
Damodar bhai!
That's what l'm saying.
Never leave anything incomplete.
lt's wrong.
bhai, these artists are very moody.
Don't talk about killing him.
He is your boy.
lt's our home production.
our film should be complete.
l told him.
l'll send him.
He is on his way.
He's at the door.
This is the 5th call since morning.
...y ou walked out of the shoot?!
That too, from a
Damodar bhai film?
He's a butcher!
He'll kidnap you! And me.
The name is Damodar.
He is a demon.
y ou'll have to pay and you'll be
on the streets too. Sorry, l...
y ou are my brother! My father!
Never leave your work incomplete.
l don't want to work in this film!
ls this a film?
lt's crap!
y ou've reached this position
only because of such films.
- but this position bites me!
- Now they will bite me!
A dog bite can be cured with
injections. but this is Damodar.
l'll need 120 injections
if he bites me!
lf he is Damodar,
l'm Deepak Kumar.
Get a nice role for me.
Roles which Shahrukh,
Jackie and Sanjay do!
They have learned acting,
but you are God gifted.
- y ou don't know what you are.
- l know everything, Dhansukh.
Call the press. And tell them
that Deepak Kumar is retiring.
y ou are retiring from your work!
They will retire me from life.
Another block buster of superstar
Deepak Kumar...
Reaching the pinnacle of success!
The heartthrob of millions!
Deepak, l'm shutting it down.
Just one minute.
lt'll stop on it's own.
Have patience, Deepak.
No, Deepak.
Deepak Kumar! y ou good for nothing
actor...get down from there!
Look look!
That's the same hero!
What's his name?
our hero, Deepak Kumar!
So your not coming down?
Not coming down?
y ou....
Hey Deepak, what's happened to you?
Why are you yelling at that poster?
Why?
l'll tell you why.
l'll tell you all!
Listen...
My beloved fans...
y ou all came to see my picture...
...your Deepak Kumar...
Time and time again....l have to
do the same acting.
Have to work in the same
style of films.
What?...Do you...
do you approve of them?
Do you think people go
and watch just acting?
Songs make the money worthwhile.
but for how long?
How long will you watch just
songs and dance?
How long for this nonsense?
Don't you people want me to do
a good role like a man?
Hey Raja.....not a man!
y our a young man!
Act like a young man!
but l want to change my style.
l want to do new scenes...
....new dialogues...
...and this guy wants me to act
like a young man?
Listen...
....my public...
...my friends...
...l am about to bring about
a whole new way of doing things.
And when l do, it will
blow you away.
Hey Mister, what's happening?
What do you think your doing?
Gathering up the public?
l talk nonsense in my films,
here l am talking sense!
Talk sense later!
Drinking, bothering the public,
no hero has a license for this!
And listen, you've been driving
under the influence.
Where's your license?
Get it out!
-y ou're asking me for my license?
-y es you!
-License from me?
-y es you!
-From Deepak Kumar?
-Deepak Kumar, come with me.
When you get a whiff of jail,
you'll come to your senses!
oK, lets go.
Forget about 2-4 hours, take
me in for 2-4 months.
At least l'll get away from this
ridiculous shooting!
Lets go!
Hurry up!
-Go and get into the car!
-l am, why are you pushing me?
He's here, Damodar-bhai.
Where are you going?
What is this, Damodar bhai?
y our thugs masquerading as cops
brought me here.
These threats don't scare me.
My name is also...Deepak...Kumar.
Plastered.
Splash water on him.
Give him black coffee.
When he comes to his senses,
he will cool down.
Gangiya, next time
you beat up anybody...
l'll come and smash you to pulp
in your own bar! Understood!
Go to Gangiya's bar. And check if
he has renewed his license or not.
lnspector.
A scoundrel tried to rape me.
Don't cry.
Sit there. Go on.
Sit down.
What happened?
There's this man,...
no, he's a beast.
He is a big film producer.
l went to him for work.
He said, 'y ou are good looking.
but l have to take a trail first'.
Sir, he called me home.
And...
Don't cry.
- What did you say his name was?
- Damodar.
Tomorrow at 9 a.m. you will
shoot for my film.
The film should be finished
on time.
or l'll finish you.
Damodar bhai, don't get angry.
Think about me as well.
l'm sick of these stereotypes!
Damodar bhai, l'll do all your
films free of cost.
but conceive a role for me
no one has ever heard about!
Something macho!
Something solid!
Hey, how did you get in?
Didn't my men stop you outside?
- y ou are Damodar?
- y es. So?
What is the telephone number
of your residence?
Why?
What is the telephone number
of your residence?
What will you do?
Speaking.
What's the matter, inspector?
y our husband has met
with an accident.
y es. Nothing to worry about.
He only has four ribs
and a broken arm.
No trace of the jaw.
l don't know which leg has broken.
lf you want to know, come to
Jaslok hospital.
- When did l meet with an accident?
- Just now.
y ou claim to be a very
big bhai (brother), don't you?
Then the womenfolk of the entire
world are your sisters.
Then how dare you rape them?
Was it with this hand?
y ou! y ou work in films?
Reach him to Jaslok hospital.
He speaks so well!
He fights so well!
- What style!
- Hey, Jaslok!
Didn't l tell you about
a character...? That's him!
l want to play a character
like him!
Produce just one film, in which
l'll play an inspector.
l won't take a single penny from you.
ln fact l'll invest some if you want.
l'll play the role of that inspector.
This is yours.
- Do you know Deepak Kumar?
- That midget?
y ou are wrong.
He is a very big actor.
Do something for me, Karan.
Keep him with you for a few days.
With me?
l can't do that, sir.
y ou won't? This is a golden
opportunity of your life.
on the contrary, it's the worst
opportunity there could be.
l? Keep that
cockroach with me?
He's not a cockroach.
Girls die to only approach him.
y ou don't know what he is.
Ask me, ask his fans.
Actually, he has only
done romantic roles so far.
Now he wants to do tough roles.
Like Dharmendra would.
Maybe, what do l do?
Do nothing. only keep him
with you for few days.
- l refuse to obey this order.
- y ou have got to obey it!
- l won't, sir!
- y ou have to!
Fine.
Remove your hand, l know you
have your resignation with you.
l'm no ordinary man. l'm the D.C.P!
- Must be!
When did l deny that?
Sir, you very well know that
l'm busy with my brother's case.
And...and you are thrusting this
cartoon on me?
Sit down.
Sit down, l say.
l'm least interested in thrusting
anyone on you!
l also have orders to obey.
This is the D.l.G's order.
- What do l do?
- l can't do this, sir.
And l'll tell you something else...
And the person you are trying to help,
he wasn't just your brother...
He was like a son to me.
Schooling him, l made him
into an inspector.
And you, this DSP made you,
this DSP!
And you can't even do this
one thing for me?
Sir, its such a thing...
Sir, you know me...
...l'm a hot tempered person...
...if something goes haywire,
l'll lay one on him!
That he'll be zeroed out.
Then don't blame me!
What do you mean by all this?
What l mean is that l can't do this.
What?
The way you kicked the door
and stormed in.
What an entry! y ou reminded me
of Amit in ' Lawaris '.
Amit?
That walk! That talk!
That style! That punch!
l don't have words to describe it.
l've gone crazy about you!
lf l make an entry like this
in one of my films...
...by God, l'll create
sensation all over lndia.
My film will do much better
then these three films.
Guru, just teach me your style.
Mr. D.C.P.
l was busy talking to Karan.
l didn't see you.
l sent you passes to the premiere
How did you find the film?
lt was wonderful!
My children were jumping on the seat.
So, Mr. Karan. y ou won't have any
problem keeping me with you.
l can help you in investigating a
murder case or tracing a gangster.
y our introduction please.
y ou probably haven't recognized me
because of my get-up.
Actually we actors can't move
around without a get-up.
- lt's artificial?
- y es.
Preserve it.
Hey, constable! Can't you hear me?
Leave my children l say!
y ou dare threaten
constable Ramlal?!
- l won't leave them. Do what you can.
- Constable, please don't do that.
Please leave my children alone.
y ou've resorted to apple-polishing?
Are you a politician's child?
l won't let them go!
l swear l won't!
- How innocent they look.
- lnnocent?!
They look like devils.
Wonder where you got them from?
The day they were born,
devils had retired!
Are they children?! When they pass by
my wallets disappear.
My socks and my vest disappears.
- l'll never leave this brat!
- Shut up!
He's shouting at me?
y ou little brat!
- Hey, slut!
- y ou called me a slut!
- He called me a slut!
- Are you a princess? Cheapskate?
Cheapskate!
y ou called me a cheapskate?!
- Forget it, sister.
- y ou!
Now how will you escape?
l'll make you bald.
See for yourself, sir.
She has taken after Phoolandevi.
She beat your Ramlal
black and blue.
People salute me and she threw
files at me!
Sir! l'm narrating my problems
and you are gaping at her.
Don't look at her.
She is a trickster.
y our name?
- Tuck your vest in and go out.
- What? Put this in and go out.
l don't have any energy left.
l can't do anything.
Ramlal, just go out!
Sending me out?
l have to pay for someone
else's crime.
Good riddance!
Sir, you are amazing!
Good you sent him away!
What do l tell you?
He caught my children.
- That bloody constable!
- Shut up!
lf you utter another word
l'll lock you in! Shut up!
What did you say your name was?
basanti, l'll spare you
on one condition.
What work?
l can't say it
in front of these children.
l know....what you will
ask me to do.
That...
...l must sleep with you.
Don't talk nonsense!
or l'll break your teeth!
ldiot! Uncouth girl!
Forgive me, sir.
That's what people ask me to do.
And you thought l'm
one of them?!
l'm sorry, sir.
Please forgive me.
l'm ready to do as you say.
l can do anything
for these children.
y ou just don't worry, sir.
l'll handle him.
y ou know, we actors are
very charming.
Karan, be careful!
His hand will come apart!
Look at her intently.
This is basanti.
And basanti this is....
This is Deepak Kumar!
- y ou want to stay with me?
- y es.
y ou have to do me a favor.
See this illiterate girl?
...you've got to make
a modern girl out of her.
y ou have to teach her English.
Transform her completely.
because she has to impersonate
a cabaret dancer.
Teach her a bit of acting.
So that she doesn't get caught.
ls that all?
That's child's play for me!
but after that, you have
to keep me with you.
lf you succeed.
basanti, you?!
His highness!
lt's my talent that transformed...
- And turned her to Mona.
- y ou've done a marvelous job.
Not l, buddy.
but my acting.
This is the talent we present on
screen and drive millions crazy.
- ln one of my films...
- Enough!
l don't want to see
your sick acting.
- Show it on screen!
- y ou are very rude.
l've kept my word. Now you
must fulfill your promise.
What promise?
Do you hear that?
He doesn't even remember!
l have to stay with you
for three months.
Can't we think of another solution?
l'll cling to you from
this very minute.
Go ahead. but you have to do me
another favor.
- What work?
- Hey, hold it!
Do your talking afterwards.
First l want to meet my children.
l'm missing them a lot.
Which schools are open at night?
l'll take you tomorrow morning.
Sister! Sister!
Where did you leave us and go?
All of you look so nice.
No, sister. We don't want to study.
We want to stay with you.
From the day all of you entered
my life, l had only one dream.
To educate you and make
nice human beings of you.
Come on, children.
Time's up.
Please look after my children.
l have no one except them.
Remember, l asked you to
do me another favor?
y ou have to take basanti
to Moonlight hotel.
- Why?
- because she...
because she has to go there
as a cabaret dancer.
but...how can he take me there?
Anyone can recognize him.
No one will recognize me.
y ou must have seen my film.
Which one?
l'm getting scared.
Shall l tell you a secret?
l'm scared too.
Don't be so astonished.
She is the same Mona.
l found her in the sea.
She had been hit by four bullets.
but since the water was cold
her blood got clotted.
l took her to the dispensary.
l treated her for a month.
As soon as she became all right.
l got her to you. Understood?
l managed to save her, but...
- but what?
Just as a short circuit can
cause a black out in the house...
similarly, when human beings receive
a shock, they lose their memory.
They don't remember anything.
Neither relations nor incidents.
She has received such a shock.
She has lost her memory.
ln her sleep, she only kept
uttering ''Moonlight hotel''.
Hence l took an appointment on
phone and got her here.
Who is she to you?
She is my fiancEe.
l was going to get married to her.
Thank you very much.
Wow, Mona!
y ou were too good.
The same electrifying movements!
The same style!
Look, Goli.
lt's true that l consider you
to be a nice human being.
but...l don't like you caressing
and kissing me.
y ou are my life.
y ou mean everything to me.
- y ou are my future wife.
- l don't remember anything.
And when you force me,
l get a splitting headache.
Till l don't recollect everything,
please don't do all this with me.
okay, Mona.
y our wish is my command.
Till you don't remember my love.
Till you don't come and embrace me.
Neither will l touch you
nor embrace you.
That's a promise.
Happy?
Tonight at Disney world we should...
.. finish the work between
1 1 :15 to 1 1 :30.
- Done!
- y es!
- Mr. Karan, basanti here.
- y es, basanti?
l heard some goons talking
just now.
Tonight they are going to
rob the Disney world.
l asked you to keep a vigil on
Goli's men. Not on stupid things.
Now what is this?
Aren't you a police officer?
So isn't it your duty
to stop thefts?
okay, l have heard that.
y es, l'm going.
Hey, oldie! Do as l say.
And give me the loot.
or l'll take your daughter to
a lonely place and...
No! Leave my daughter. l'll give you
as much as money you want.
Karan, the gate is closed!
No, Karan!
y ou are mad!
be careful!
My life is very precious.
- y ou want to fight?
- y es.
- With me only?
- y es!
Just a minute.
one moment...
First say action.
Say action.
Leave my man alone.
or l'll blow his brains off!
Get in!
Dirtied my suit.
l told you not to step
out of the jeep!
Why did you step out?
What did you think?
That this a film shooting?!
And they were fake goons?!
With fake revolvers?!
Come out of your superficial
world and look around!
Look at reality!
Look at me!
When l leave my house at dawn l don't
know whether l'll return or no?
l can't say at which crossroad,
death is waiting to maim me!
Had he shot you, your head would've
blown up like a watermelon!
And it would be lying on
the streets...
where some stray dog
would've feasted on it!
ln your profession, you get many
opportunities to correct your mistake.
Many retakes!
but we get only one take!
And if we falter,
we die!
Repeat that line, please!
That one about the retake!
lf l learn that line,
my life will be made!
broke my tape recorder?
- Why did you shut it off?
- No more movies.
Please switch it on.
lt's Deepak Kumar's song.
lf l see this cartoon again,
l'll throw away the T.v.
Sister-in-law! He's not
letting me switch on the T.v.
Why call her?
l'm your elder brother.
This monkey shouldn't be seen here.
Look, don't abuse Deepak Kumar!
l will! He looks like an ape,
a monkey, an owl!
- y ou abused him again?!
- l'll abuse him on his face.
- y ou?
- y es.
What is there to laugh about?
Don't you believe me?
- No?
- No.
y ou stop laughing.
lf l call him home,... stop making
faces and listen to me!
What if l call him home and make him
stay with my dog in the garage?
- With Tommy?
- y es!
y ou still don't believe me?
What if l do it?
l'll do as you say.
- Promise?
- Promise.
- y ou'll never watch his films.
- okay.
Stop laughing.
What a personality!
What height!
Want to be an actor?
Forget Deepak.
l made him the star he is.
y ou'll create a sensation!
y ou'll become a hero from zero!
Can you fight?
Dance, perhaps?
l'll teach you.
y ou just have to spend some money.
Raise 25 thousand. The money goes
here, and you go there!
Definitely you must be having a name.
but l'll give you a nice name.
- What is your name?
- My name?
y ou are great, sir!
Simply great!
Mr. Deepak is your fan!
y ou have driven him crazy!
He only thinks
about you all the time!
This is just a trailer.
but you must become an actor.
y ou must!
Don't think!
Raaj Kumar was an inspector first.
Now he's one of the top most actor.
He has created a sensation
in the film industry .
He has become
a pain for everybody.
- Where will l find Deepak?
- Forget Deepak.
The carpet which Deepak is standing
on today, l had laid it.
l'll pull it and down he goes!
- Where is Deepak?
- Upstairs!
This man is of no use.
So damn original?!
l was thinking about you only.
y our action is too good!
And your dialogue! l shook the
writers of the industry!
- Where are your clothes?
- Clothes?
ln the cupboard.
Why are you putting my clothes in
the bag? Are we going somewhere?
- y es.
- Where to?
- To my house.
- Why?
because my duty-hours
are unpredictable.
Anything can happen anytime!
And l have to be there.
And if you are not around,
it'll be your loss.
That's right. lf l stay with you,
l'll have a 24 hour class.
Wear this.
Actually, Karan. l have only
stayed in five star hotels.
Staying in your house will
be a good experience.
How about some tea or coffee?
Have some juice at least.
As l was saying, you must have an
air-conditioner in your house?
A hot and cold shower. A bath-tub!
Life without all this is dry.
Right, Karan.
- Where are you going?
- Say l'm going abroad for a month.
For a month!
Mother!
Quite a small lift.
but it's cute.
ln case the lights go of when
a couple is in the lift....
...what a romantic scene
it can be.
Get in!
Come on!
lsn't this house a bit small?
l want a big room
with an air conditioner.
Look, we have three rooms. For me,
my sister and my sister-in-law.
- Understood!
- Where will l stay?
ln the garage.
- Garage?
- y es!
We'll put a cot there.
Go to sleep.
Let alone an a/c, there is neither
a fan nor a window there.
Me? ln the garage?
Stand up! ... Up!
- Do you want to stay with me?
- y es, but...
Shut up.
Sit down quietly.
bloody nuisance!
What are you doing here?
Go and make some tea.
Shivangi! Go and make tea!
That's the bathroom!
This house of yours.
There's lot of realism in it!
Will you give me your house
on rent for shooting?
y ou will not discuss anything
about a shoot here!
- Why?
- because...
My sister is your...very big fan.
l don't understand how anyone
can be your fan!
lt might surprise you.
but l have thousands of fan.
Maybe, but l don't want
any fan in my house...
Else l'll hang you from the fan!
Thousands of fan, my foot!
Listen! Listen!
l want you to do something that
my sister starts hating you.
- Why?
- because l say so!
l won't.
l won't.
- y ou won't?
- No.
- y ou won't?
- No.
No?
- No.
but why not?
First smile and say ''please''.
l've said it.
How much sugar will you take?
Don't you think you've put
a lot of sugar?
Sugar?
Shivangi! What are you doing?
Go and prepare food.
Go to the kitchen.
Will you drink it?
- Ladyfinger!
- Lady finger?!
l told you l don't like lady finger!
Then why did you make it?!
l like it.
l made it for him and
not for you, brother.
- He loves ladyfinger.
- Heard that?
- And how do you know that?
- l read his interview in 'Stardust'.
Ladyfinger.
- What is it?
- Sister-in-law! Look who's here.
- Sister-in-law, he...
- l know, he's Deepak Kumar.
Chutki is a very big
fan of yours.
- She watches all your films.
- Please sit. The food is delicious.
Especially the lady finger.
Sister-in-law, take care of Shivangi!
She is getting out of control.
Ask her to concentrate on her studies.
And stop watching movies.
Sister-in-law, what does
she know about fans?
l'll tell you what a fan is!
one day someone phoned me at
three in the morning.
An aggrieved mother was pleading me
to save her daughter.
Do you know what had
happened to her daughter?
What?
Her daughter was a
great fan of mine.
She was so crazy that she carved out
my name on her wrist with a knife.
What do l tell you? While doing
that, she slit a nerve.
- What are you saying?
- y es, and she bled a lot.
She was almost on
the verge of dying!
This is called madness.
Shivangi's madness is nothing
compared to this.
l have millions of fans like her.
l've been watching you.
for the last two hours
lt's like moving with a bloody mirror!
l can't even think, because of you!
y ou ape me! y ou even smoke like me!
Soon l'm going to quit smoking!
Me too! lt is a bad habit.
one second,... why are you
getting so angry?
l was only trying to be like you.
lt's easy to tackle an army,
but not a monkey like you!
Do you know where l'm going?
- No.
- To the loo!
- Come and watch me do it!
- No thank you.
What's the point in watching
something we can't show the public?
Carry on.
Are you Damodar?
Are you Damodar?
What is the telephone number
of your residence?
l'm neither interested in your
films nor your heroes! Got it?!
Don't try to bug me!
- Karan, is Deepak there?
- oh, sister-in-law. l'm Deepak.
While writing your name on her wrist,
Shivangi slit her nerve.
l'm calling from Holy Spirit hospital.
Please rush here soon.
And don't tell Karan anything.
Sister-in-law, don't worry,
l'll be there right away.
Hey jerk!
Not now sister.
Sister-in-law, how is Shivangi?
ls she out of danger?
y es. but even the doctors
were scared initially.
She just wouldn't stop bleeding.
l thought l had lost her.
Sister-in-law, don't cry.
Everything will be all right.
Shivangi was my husband's favorite.
She is like a daughter to me.
- l wonder why she was so crazy?
- l very well understand this.
l have a cure for it too.
Please wait here.
What madness is this?
y ou had told me that someone else
is a greater fan of yours than me.
Who had etched your name
on her wrist.
l also tried, but l don't know
when l fell unconscious.
l had lied to you folks.
- but l took it seriously.
- but...
but why?
So that my name is on top
of the list of your fans.
Can anyone love someone so dearly?
y es.
Will you come close?
Closer.
Closer.
l love you.
Whatever you are doing
is not good.
And what is it that l'm doing?
Don't try to hide from me.
l know everything. y ou and Deepak...
- lt's better if you don't meet him.
- Why? lsn't he a nice human being?
of course, he is
a very nice person.
- but...
- but what?
Look, Chutki. lt's not advisable
to talk to Karan now.
As, all he can think about is
your brother's killer.
lf l talk to him now,
he will get angry.
So l suggest you remain quiet for
a few days and not meet each other.
When the time is right l'll
personally talk to him.
And l'm sure, Karan will
never say no to me.
Don't cry, Chutki.
What happened?
- l'll never meet you again.
Not meet me?
Why not?
because neither brother nor
sister-in-law will be happy.
Hence it's better....
if we don't meet again.
Why not? Why won't Karan accept
our relationship?
We love each other. l'll
straight away go and tell him...
...that l want to marry you.
No, Deepak. Karan will
never understand our feelings.
He cannot see beyond
the law and his duties.
He won't understand our sentiments.
Why won't he? Hitherto no one
has made an effort.
Love can even melt a
stone-hearted person.
What? Love?!
And that too brother Karan?
He can't even smile,
what will he think about love.
He will Shivangi.
We will teach him how to love.
When he realizes what love is,
he'll value our love too.
And after that our
path will be cleared.
No way. He's always talking
about guns and bullets.
Which girl is crazy to
fall in love with him?
There is a girl, Shivangi.
And he will fall in love.
l'll bring such a twist in his life
that he'll be left with no choice.
- Not everybody get what they want.
- Why not?
Tell me something.
How do you find Karan?
Absolutely boring.
of course. All the time he moves
around with a sick look on his face.
There's no smile on his lips.
A curt look.
And neither have l seen
any sympathy in his eyes.
y ou know how he
looks when he walks?
Like a loaded revolver
dressed like a man.
Don't say that. He has lot of
sympathy for you if not for others.
oh forget it.
That's a load of bull-shit!
He can never have sympathy
for anybody.
That's where you are wrong.
y ou have only seen his face.
Come down a bit and
peep into his heart.
He's like a coconut.
A hard exterior and tender within.
l don't believe you.
Why don't you believe me?!
l...l swear to...my make up.
l stay with him 24 hours. And most
of the time he only talks about you.
About me? Really?
l just swore, and still you
don't believe me?
- What does he say?
- He says that...
He says that...
He doesn't say anything.
He's foolish in this matter.
- but one thing really hurts him.
- What?
That you dance on the streets
and bandy words with men.
And...and pick pockets.
What do l do? l have to do
something for a living.
No, basanti. Don't sacrifice your
love for your living.
Just imagine that you are a
police officer's wife.
y ou'll get so much of respect.
Just imagine, your orphan children
will at least have a father.
- y ou have come?!
- Hey! At least leave my uniform!
- y ou want to be a police officer?
- y es, l do!
- y ou dare scold my children?!
- l was only...
y ou didn't answer my question.
Speak up, basanti.
Speak up!
What do l say?
This dream can't come true.
- lt can basanti. lt can!
- How come?
- Will you do as l say?
- l will.
Why did you get me here?
- buddy, l'm very unhappy today.
- What do l do?
Look, buddy.
l have no one in this world.
only Dhansukh... my secretary.
- And you, my friend.
- Listen to me carefully.
l'm no friend of yours. After your
work is over we go separate ways.
And why have you got me here?
Whether you take me as
your friend or not...
l want to spend the evening with you.
- Why?
because today is my birthday.
- Now what?
- Today is my birthday.
- How about a drink?
- No. l lose control over myself.
y ou must've drunk hooch. l'll
treat you to ''Deepak Kumar special''.
- No, l won't.
- Today is my birthday!
- only one.
- okay.
- Let's go.
- one is for enmity.
- l don't care. l won't drink!
- Scared, eh?
Me?
- That's it.
- ls that all?
l forget to tell you.
basanti had called this morning.
She sounded scared.
She says every night at 10,
someone knocks at her door.
- Why?
- l don't know.
y ou left her among the wolves.
lmagine, if someone breaks open
the door, then her chastity will...
Why will anyone do that?
l've taken responsibility to protect
her honor! Understood!
y ou are here and she is there.
l must go.
He has not yet come.
He is here!
y ou? y ou are drunk?
No.
l...am drunk.
y ou here, at this hour
of the night?
one should solve night problems
in the night only.
At 10 o'clock some son-of-a-gun...
...knocks at your door,
and disturbs your peace.
He's here?
Don't open the door.
l'm getting very scared.
but what are you doing?
Please stay away.
The next time he knocks,
l'll pounce at him immediately.
And l'll beat him so much...
Stay back.
My clothes with hers?
basanti, what happened?
y ou have ruined me!
l'm undone!
Last night you did
whatever you liked.
- What...what did l do?
- What did you do?! y ou...
- basanti, don't cry. Listen to me.
- Don't come near me!
one minute. l'll just come.
Come again?
y ou did everything?
y ou raped that girl?
People revere and respect cops.
And that very inspector has
outraged a girl's modesty?
l could never imagine that you
are a devil in disguise.
Poor basanti.
l didn't do it deliberately.
lt was an accident.
What do l do?
What do l tell you?
y ou have only two options.
Either serve a term for
seven years for rape...
...or get married to her.
Hows that possible? Neither does
she know me nor do l love her.
As far as knowing you is concerned
by now she knows you too well.
And as for love... you know this
country of ours is amazing.
Girls here fall in love with
their husbands after marriage.
Just get married,
she will start loving you.
- Shall l send for invitation cards?
- Hey! Wait!
- but....
- No ifs and buts.
Tell me something, if she tells
you that she loves you...
...then will you marry her?
- y es...if...
- y es, speak up!
lf she says ' l love you '
then it's fine.
Deepak here. Do as l have told you.
l'm giving Karan the phone.
Whatever happened last night...
l am....
...extremely sorry.
- basanti, here.
- y es?
Goli's goods worth millions have
been delivered to a godown at vashi.
lf you wish, you can raid
that place right now.
Now?
y es, because at 4 p.m.
the goods will be shifted....
...and delivered to
their respective dealers.
4 p.m.!
According to basanti, there must
be only four to five men here.
l'm going down and you...
will stay here.
- y ou won't come after me, okay!
- Why?
Why not?
l will come!
Fine. Come after me.
Karan, if you don't release me!
Come on!
The keys!
Quick!
Why?
lf it wasn't for your
timely help, l'd have...
by saving my life, you have proved
that you are a hero and not a zero.
Today l saved your life. Will you
give me anything l ask for?
What?
Karan, l...l love your sister
and want to marry her.
Such a big loss?
Such a big loss?!
only half an hour more.
only half an hour more!
And the goods would have been
delivered to the dealers.
There's someone.
There's someone amongst us...
...who is a police informer.
- y es?
- Should l say something?
l'm getting scared. y ou go in
and l'll wait out?
- Why?
- l've a wife and four children.
l'm the only bread winner. And this
terrorist has committed 30 murders.
- Thirty murders?
- lf l die they will become orphans.
l'm getting very scared.
What's this?
Why are you fooling at this time?
Forget it, sir.
What's this for?
When the terrorist comes, you'll
lose your heel. Keep it in!
Sir, you go in.
May God protect you.
This is loaded.
Keep it.
only to protect you.
lf required, shoot only
at the leg. lf required.
And don't come out
of the jeep.
Don't step out of the jeep.
Stop, or l'll shoot.
Stop!
Stop, or l'll shoot!
He has a machine gun!
He is running away!
Shoot!
Stop! Stop!
What have you done?
y ou shot Ramlal?!
No! l thought it was someone else.
Do you know the consequences of
shooting a police officer?
No.
Didn't l tell you
not to step out of the jeep.
Didn't l tell you to shoot
at the leg?
Why did you shoot on the chest?
What have you done?
l've killed a constable.
My life, my career everything
has got ruined.
Listen.
- Give me this revolver.
- y ou are arresting me?
lf someone learns you've committed
this murder, you'll be hanged.
l'll only lose my job.
And if l take the blame on myself,
you'll be saved.
And so will your career.
At the most...
... l'll lose my job and will
be sentenced for a year or two.
y ou must leave
this city and go away.
Forget that such a thing ever
happened or you saw it happen.
l'll handle everything.
Nothing will happen to you.
Nothing.
Give all kind of monetary
support to Ramlal and his family.
l've explained everything
to my secretary.
Appoint a nice lawyer, if you want.
Don't worry about the money.
one minute. Take this.
l'll be here for a few days.
Do keep me informed.
And Karan, l'll phone you
after every half an hour.
Don't make that mistake.
because the lines will be tapped.
lf someone hears our conversation,
we'll be sentenced for a year or two.
okay, l won't phone.
Wait, Deepak.
What are you doing?
Karan, on one hand, is staking
his life and his career.
And you are running
away like a coward?
ls your conscience dead?
y ou love Shivangi a lot, don't you?
Then how will you face her?
Get up, Deepak.
And confess to your crime!
He was shaking with fear.
He placed his head on my stomach.
l was getting tickled
... l was about to jump.
Thank God, l didn't. or the
truth would have been unveiled.
but one thing is for sure, sir.
The way you drove him out of the city,
he'll remember all his life...
that even police officers
are good actors.
- Who is it?
- lt's you. okay, tell me something.
l loaded fake bullets in the revolver.
but how did you start bleeding?
- Was that blood?
- Then what was it?
Tomato ketchup.
l filled it in a plastic bag and kept
it here, and pressed it like this.
And seeing the ketchup,
he lost his senses.
- Sir, only one clap.
- Put your vest in.
To hell with the vest.
l feel like jumping with joy.
How he ran for his life!
Let alone coming here,
his plane won't even...
- What is it?
- The plane has landed, sir.
Landed? Where?
This vest has become too long.
l'll go and change it.
So last night....
...we were out to nab
a dangerous terrorist?
And l shot your constable
by mistake?
y ou did a great favor to me.
y ou took the revolver from me
and put your finger prints on it?
Look, next time you raise
your hand...
Let alone beating you, l can
get you arrested for fraud!
y ou claim to be an inspector?!
A police officer!
but you are a cheat!
And you and your cheap constable
were making fun of me?!
l was crazy about you, because
you were a complete man!
by aping your style, your walk,
l wanted to win an award!
but...but now l won't.
because l don't like
aping fakes.
Just once you should have caught
me by my collar slapped me...
...and asked me, how dare
l fell in love with your sister?
l would have beseeched you.
Fallen at your feet and asked
your sister's hand in marriage.
but no. Tears can melt hearts but
not stone-hearted people like you.
y ou are a heartless, ruthless
shrewd person!
y ou neither care about your sister
nor her love nor her happiness!
And not even her future!
Mr. inspector, first learn to protect
hearts. y ou may then protect the law!
lf moving around with guns and
acting tough is duty for you...
Then you are wrong!
lt's your pride and ego!
We call it the act of a bully.
y ou wanted me to go away
from your life, didn't you?
And your sister's life too?
All right. l'm going away! Forever!
be happy, and if possible
let others also be happy.
lf l have made any mistake
unknowingly, then do forgive me.
Take care.
Are you happy now?
Are you happy, having broken
your kid sister's heart?
y ou claim to be her elder brother!
but have you ever asked her what she
wants, have you ever sat with her?
y ou didn't fulfill your duty
but l will fulfill mine!
l'm not only her sister-in-law,
but her mother too.
And Deepak is the right choice
as a son-in-law!
lf someone else comes to marry her,
l won't be alive to welcome him.
Had he been alive, then his decision
would have also been the same, Karan.
Dhansukh, where's Deepak?
He went upstairs. He was in a
bad mood. Anything wrong?
Actually, l've come to seek
an alliance for my sister.
- That's good news.
- l don't accept this alliance!
l do!
And l will, till my last breath!
but what you did with me,
l can't forget all my life!
- l know l made a small mistake.
- Small mistake?!
Had l not returned from the airport,
you had almost got rid of me!
but my conscience told me that Karan
is giving such a big sacrifice.
He's staking his life.
Go back, Deepak!
And when l returned l saw this!
What did you think l was?!
Deepak, you can't do this!
y ou can't play with Shivangi's life!
- y ou have got to marry her!
- l won't! What will you do?
l...
What can l do?
Nothing.
Nothing.
- on one condition.
- What?
First smile and say please.
Smile, Karan.
- Get up, Ramlal.
- No, sir.
lt's time to leave the world.
- Don't joke, Ramlal!
- No, sir.
l'm not joking, sir.
l've been really shot.
Today l learnt how painful it is
when you get really shot.
- Nothing will happen to you. Get up!
- No, sir.
Sir, will you do me a favor?
- What?
- Won't you tell me?
Ramlal, go and tuck your vest in!
Say it, sir.
No.
What's this? Such a short meeting?
We had just met.
And he left?
Friends! From today they
are my foreign partners.
They do the same business in their
country which we do here.
They don't stay anywhere for more
than an hour or two.
because they are wanted by
the police all over the world!
Soon they will leave.
So l wanted you to meet them.
because many of you will have to
go to their country for business.
Come, Mr. Peter. l'll introduce
you to my partners.
This is Mr. Ram Mohan.
This is Mr. Peter.
basanti here.
l have found proof against Goli.
Mona just left from here,
she had camera in her hand
What?
Someone has made a call to the
police station from here, sir.
- From which room?
- 402. From Mona's room.
What nonsense?!
- She is on line!
- Put me through.
This roll contains all the black
deeds of these smugglers.
And not only that.
With the help of these picture you can
easily arrest Goli and his men.
This is the best opportunity.
Through this roll, you can
get to your brother's killer.
- And send them to the gallows.
- Hi, love.
l'll call you later.
Whom were you talking to?
A...a friend of mine.
Where is the roll?
Which roll?
Then why is there sweat on
your brow so beautiful?
What are you saying?
Don't you believe your Mona?
l was wondering...
...how our goods were being seized,
despite all the secrecy.
And who has been giving information
to inspector Karan?
So it's you!
y ou!
l loved Mona very much.
When l could kill her with
my very hands....
...you ...you are just her
look alike.
lmagine what l'll do to you.
Tell me, where's the roll?
Look here and tell me
where is the roll?!
- Where it should have reached!
- Where?!
To inspector Joglekar!
- There's bad news for you.
- What nonsense are you talking?
y our basanti is in my custody.
l'll tell you later
who l am.
- First give me the roll.
- Roll?! Which roll?
or l'll cut your basanti
into pieces...
...and throw her in the courtyard
of your police station.
but the roll...
So inspector, are you dumbfounded?
- l want an answer.
- okay, l'll give you the roll.
but nothing should happen
to basanti.
Tell me, where must l bring it?
Listen carefully.
ls basanti okay?
basanti's life is in danger.
They want the roll, which they
didn't find it with basanti.
They think l have it.
but where do l get it from?
- The usual trick!
- Meaning?
buy any roll from the market.
Till they develop it...
- ...we'll get her released.
- How can...
We shouldn't underestimate
our enemies.
We'll take the roll,
but my way.
l might escape from the
police here.
but the police abroad will
find me at any cost.
They won't spare me.
y ou think Karan is a fool?!
lf l don't leave with basanti
in ten minutes...
...he will be here with the
entire police force.
Where is the roll?
Get it here.
First show me basanti.
Look, l've got another
gift for you.
Which will make you come to me
running like a small child.
Look.
Hey actor.
Where are you going?
y ou think l'm a fool?
First the roll will be developed,
then printed...
...the photographs will be seen
and then they will be released.
Deepak, move!
Stop those scoundrels!
Quick!
blast the tire!
Come out!
Move!
lt's very painful, isn't it?
Actually you have also caused me
terrible pain in my life.
Therefore...
...there's a strange intoxication
in causing you pain.
l like it.
l'm enjoying.
Look, tell me where the roll is!
or you will undergo this torture
for a week.
l might get tired.
but he is a devil.
Let alone a week.
Continue this even for a year!
yet l won't give you the roll.
l won't!
Why do you want to
torture yourself to death?
Die like your brother died.
An easy death.
y ou know how your brother died?
At my behest, he pumped five
bullets into him.
He was torn to shreds.
y ou see this loyal
servant of mine?
He is very heartless.
bloody hell, don't hit me
on my face!
y ou know the value of my face is
more than your master's factory.
Never mind. When he comes around,
start the torture again.
He won't acquiesce so soon.
be it in film or reality, hero always
rescues the damsel in distress.
Hurry up.
Wait.
Come on out!
or your artist friend won't be alive
to perform before the world!
Come out! or l'll kill everybody!
Come out!
Ask me what fear is?!
When l leave home in the morning.
l'm not sure whether l'll return
home in the evening or no!
l can't say at which crossroad
death waits to maim me!
He's saying exactly what l told him!
y es, exactly the same!
- Sir, he has copied...
- be quiet.
- Where are you going?
- l don't want to see this film.
Nice film, isn't it?
