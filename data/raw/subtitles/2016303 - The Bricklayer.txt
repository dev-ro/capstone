I'm alone, just as we agreed.
Of course you are.
You're very ambitious...
and you know this story is gold.
Did you bring it?
You're no fan of
US intelligence.
You're a little short
on the details.
It's a good thing we met.
- How did you...
- Does it matter? They're real.
No, you can't have them.
Yes, you can take photos.
This type of scandal could
destroy the US.
Yes.
Many will die.
But you called me.
You want this story out there.
I do.
But unfortunately for you...
I want to be the one
to do the telling.
Is the CIA murdering
journalists?
German journalist Greta Becker
was found dead in a Greek hotel.
Sparking protests across Europe.
The third such murder
in a month.
Miss Becker was an outspoken critic
of US intelligence activities abroad.
Greek Deputy Minister of
Foreign Affairs...
Kostas Leontaris, pulled no punches
when asked about the incident.
For decades, the United States
has shown zero regard
for the sovereignty
of other nations.
But the days of the CIA treating
Europe like the Wild West are over.
Hey.
It's nice of you to show up.
I like to work at night.
Because you have no life?
Because it's easier to focus.
What have you got for me?
Jack and shit.
The hotel Greta Becker
was staying at has no CCTV
so I've scanned the streets
around and the train station opposite.
Nothing.
I did see a nun
traveling with a full drum kit.
That was a new one.
Hey, I said I already
checked those.
I know. But I might see
something you didn't.
Holy shit.
Sir, I've been trying
to reach you.
Check your email.
I'm in the middle of breakfast.
This is urgent.
What am I looking at?
Security footage.
Thessaloniki train station,
two days ago.
Our guys already combed this.
Why are you wasting my time?
Because they missed this.
Victor Radek.
Have you told Thessaloniki?
I haven't told anyone.
What do you know about him?
Most of his files were redacted.
Civilian born in Greece
but grew up all over.
Died eighteen months ago.
But they never did
find his body.
He was a covert CIA operative
working as an intermediary between
the Russian and Greek Mafias.
Who ran him for us over there?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, we're on it.
We're on it.
Yeah, well, if we had more guys,
it would help.
Yeah, I...
Yeah, hold on a sec.
Can I help you?
Steve Vail.
So?
I'm the bricklayer.
He'll have the number five with
provolone and some of
that fancy aioli.
But hold the peppers.
It aggravates his indigestion.
What do you want?
Can't an old friend stop
by to say hello?
Is that what we are?
Friends, enemies.
In our business, there's
no distinction.
Someone's trying to
blackmail the CIA.
They're sending messages
with bodies attached.
All journalists who have made
careers going after U.S
intelligence abroad.
They're trying to make it look
like the CIA is doing the killing.
Whoever's doing the blackmailing
possesses classified information
that could bring down
our entire global network.
We think it's Victor Radek.
Radek's one of the most
dangerous men I've ever known
but he never killed innocents.
I watched him die.
None of this tracks.
Recognize this pretty face?
Boris Popov.
Russian smuggler, bad breath.
Two years ago, Popov died
in a boating accident
outside of the port
of Thessaloniki.
Accident.
Right.
Popov was a hit
performed by Radek
commissioned by the CIA.
This photo of Popov was found at
the scene of Greta Becker's murder.
You know what this
means, don't you?
It means Radek is back...
And he's got secrets to tell.
This is no longer
just a cursory fact-finding.
We need to bring him in.
That's why I want you
to go to Greece with her.
What?
Sir-
You're joking.
You know his habits,
contacts, networks.
I can brief someone else.
Someone with more experience.
We don't know who's compromised.
Right now, only the three of us
know that Radek is alive.
It stays that way.
Look I'm persona non grata
with the agency
I can't even enter
Greece legally.
This isn't sanctioned, Vail.
We're doing it off the books.
You'll be working around the Greeks
and Interpol as well as our own people.
Sir, I really think that
you should reconsider
sending someone
a little bit more credentialed.
I agree.
She wouldn't last 24
hours on the ground.
I was talking about you.
Enough.
This is your fuck up Vail
and you need to fix it.
Before he starts coming for you.
Unless, of course, you
want to do it for your country.
I'm done with my country.
Fix your own fucking mess.
Uncle Vail!
Careful, Sylvie!
This is called a trowel.
This is a bricklayer's
most important tool.
She's a natural.
Wait, wait, let's take a photo.
Alright.
What?
Who do you work for?
Radek sends his regards!
Surprised you changed your mind.
Cut yourself shaving?
Had a visit from some
old friends.
Oh, you brought your tools.
Can you at least pretend
to take this seriously?
I never do a job without
my tools.
That makes zero sense.
We're going on a manhunt,
not building a chimney.
If you understood
everything I said
you'd be me.
Miles Davis.
Greatest jazz musician
of all time.
I don't listen to music.
You're joking.
It's a big assignment for you.
First time in the field.
No supervisors.
I'm the supervisor.
Listen.
I'm here to find Radek.
I'll give you reports every day.
Just give me space
to do my thing.
Everything goes right,
you just might end promoted.
It's really funny.
I'll likely get blacklisted
working with you.
Why are you here?
Because I believe in
what we're doing.
Of course you do.
Everybody wants to be a spy.
Until they realize the cost.
Lost years.
No time for friends, family,
relationships
pets.
Not an issue for me.
All right.
Let's go over the operations
briefing on our way over.
Looks like we're
landing at 04...
Time to wake up.
Still Miles Davis.
We're landing.
You drive.
Take the next exit.
The GPS says to stay
on this road.
Yeah, well I gotta take a
a gentlemen's break.
Pull inside.
- What?
- Before they shoot us.
Where the fuck are
you taking us?
How do you like my pop-up?
Good to see you kid!
You too, old man.
What is going on here?
You're looking good.
Yeah, lots of hot yoga.
Lovely to meet you, Kate.
Vail has told me nothing
about you.
He's told me nothing
about you either.
Patricio is my outfitter.
He's with the agency?
He's family. We served together.
So you're American?
Only when I need to be.
Oh, bless you, sweet man.
What is that? Drugs? You
brought drugs on the CIA transport?
No, you don't understand.
You can't get this
shit in Europe.
New kind of cancer treatment.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Here we go.
Come on, baby.
Hey, baby, there you are.
How you doing, girl?
She loves to hide
under the office.
Must be the rats.
Here you go.
The dog. The drugs
are for the dog.
Vail?
This wasn't authorized.
- This entire op, isn't authorized.
- You know what I mean.
You can't just switch it
up on me like this.
Wanna fly under the radar,
this is how you fly.
- You can't make that decision on your own.
- You wanna find Radek?
We need to do it the right way.
You mean your way.
You called me. This
is how I work.
Can you reset us? Top to bottom?
Let's go.
What is this?
You got a new look.
Am I to sell Louis Vuittons?
This is way too high-end
for middle-class tourists.
We're losing those covers.
My name's Torrance. I'm a
shipping magnate. You're my wife.
So now we're married?
That's the only way to sell it.
You're too old to be my girlfriend.
Cell phones, passports,
credit cards, driver's licenses.
I even put an iTunes gift
card in there for you.
She doesn't like music.
Very romantic. Thank you.
Glock 45 full size.
Serial numbers wiped.
19 round mags.
I'll take two, please.
How about you? Or is
this not authorized either?
This one won't bite too hard.
I'll take this one.
Here.
Oh, a little less cologne
next time.
Yes, ma'am.
And for the final touch.
Hey, Rabbit.
Bring in the rosebud.
Mercedes CLS AMG V8
biturbo engine.
I bored it out to seven point
two liters, adding 550 horsepower.
Beefed up brakes and
suspension...
reinforced the front
and rear fascia.
Added auxiliary fuel tank
and radar detector.
There's no airbags.
So drive safe.
No promises.
Thank you, Patricio.
Have a great trip.
You know how to reach
me if you need me.
What you don't like dogs either?
Don't wipe your hands
on the car.
Who's paying for all this?
Your favorite uncle, Sam.
I'm not going to even ask.
That's probably best.
Why don't you go clean
up and we'll regroup?
Clean up?
Yeah, we've been traveling
for 15 hours.
And we need to look our
best for where we're heading.
Thought you might want
to take a shower.
I was being considerate.
Thanks.
I guess I could use a shower.
I'll order some food.
Make it quick.
Yes, you got fries.
Vail?
Vail?
This came today, and
its a good package.
For your collection. It's my
favorite. I listen to it all the time.
I brought you something, too.
Grizzly Pines, Montana.
Possible resettlement location.
Is it oceanfront?
Adjacent.
Sorry to interrupt.
There is a Hellenistic Revival piece
over here you absolutely must see.
The world thinks
the CIA is killing journalists.
You're out hobnobbing. Damn
irresponsible, don't you think?
Its called networking.
What are you doing here?
I miss Greece.
You don't look happy
to see me, Tye.
The police are still
looking for you.
Oh I don't think I'm in any
danger of being outed in this crowd.
Unless you want to turn me in.
You know, Kostas already suspects
the US is running among here.
One call to him, they'd
name an island after me.
Wow. Foreign minister
on speed dial.
You've certainly moved up in
the world since I last saw you.
I'm sure the agency would be
interested to know you're back in town.
Well, I got a bigger
trophy for them.
Victor Radek.
Radek is dead.
Not anymore. The agency believes
he's the one behind its current PR problem.
O'Malley sent you.
Mhm.
- Why aren't they sharing their intel?
- They think there's a mole.
Radek's supposedly in
possession of some doomsday intel.
You know what it is?
Well, you seem to know
a lot more than I do.
Which is pretty frustrating,
considering I'm head of fucking station.
I heard. Congrats.
Look, I'm here because
need your help.
Radek and I used to throw
cash to an off-shoot gang
when we needed dirty work done.
We dealt with a guy called Sten.
You've been gone too long.
Sten is now Denis Stefanopoulos.
He got clean?
No, he got smart. He runs the
Boheme Club out on the beach.
That's quite the jump
for him, too.
Seems I should have stuck
around. I might be president.
So long Tye.
Wait.
If Kostas finds out you're here,
he'll make an example of you.
He's running his own investigation,
just wait until I get his next brief.
We can crack this together.
You don't get to ask
me to wait anymore.
I did it once.
Torrance.
Look at you, Sten.
Hey, got yourself one of these.
It's Mr. Stefanopoulos now.
And yes, I've been
very fortunate.
Some gambles have paid off.
A lot has changed since
you disappeared.
Oh, I didn't disappear.
I just had other appointments
to keep.
Where'd you go?
Didn't you hear I got married?
Spent the last six months
on honeymoon.
First Malaysia, then
the Galapagos.
Even did a few weeks in
Jawbone, Kentucky.
Well, congratulations
are in order then.
Come on. Come on in. Come on,
sit down, have a drink.
I'm looking for Radek.
Radek's dead. You know that.
Sure. You know what
they say about Balkan men.
They never really die,
they just smell that way.
Business looks good. Too good
for you to be doing this all alone.
There's gotta be a partner
somewhere behind those velour ropes.
Just want to talk to
him, that's all.
I told you what you
already know.
He's dead.
Stick with that, then.
I'm not some small-time punk you
can just push around anymore.
I'm a respected businessman.
My word means something.
Yeah, you look the part.
Except your suit jacket's
about two sizes too big.
And I still see prison ink
on half your boys here.
Here's a tip, guys.
You don't leave the top four buttons
open you might as well not wear the shirt.
Judging by the cigar smoke, you still
don't know a Cohiba from a Don Tomas.
You know what all that tells me?
You're nothing more than
an up-jumped thug
playing dress-up.
While daddy's at work.
You should have stayed
where you were.
Cause now that you're back
it's gonna be hard for
you to leave again.
You might as well have
that drink now.
Since I have no choice.
Shit.
You're dead!
You're fucking dead!
Get him!
Get in!
What the hell, Vail?
This is a rental!
You couldn't have splurged
for a mid-size?
Who was that back there?
Some local thugs.
You are the worst spy ever.
There are protocols. You can't
just leave me in the dust.
Trust me, it's for your
own protection.
Oh, please. You're lucky
that I was there.
We need to swing by the hotel
for my tools give me your phone.
- Why?
- That's how you're tracking me, right?
- No.
- I found your bug.
In my shirt collar. Alright,
give it to me
I put it on someone who
could lead us to Radek.
Nice.
Hey.
Look, if I'm gonna help you...
you're gonna need
to help me too.
Fill in the blanks.
The file says that
Radek went rogue.
What happened?
Radek was a go-between with
the Greek and Russian mafias.
But in reality, he was...
he was performing assignments.
For us.
Assignments? Like...
like that hit on Boris Popov?
The guy from the picture?
That's right. He joined the CIA to
get asylum for his wife and daughter
but his cover got blown and
the Russians killed his family.
I saw the photos.
Radek became unhinged.
He went on revenge tour...
slaughtering Russians all over
Greece, anyone he thought was involved.
So that's when the CIA ordered
you to take him out?
I was asked to track
him down and neutralize him.
I thought I did.
Anything else?
No.
Actually, yes. How the fuck did
you know that I was allergic to dogs?
Single woman, your age, no pets.
How did you know I was single?
Lucky guess.
Oh my...
Torture, genocide.
Civilians murdered.
Governments toppled through
violent insurrection.
Crimes committed not
by your enemies,
but by the US itself.
For decades the world has turned
a blind eye out of fear and profit.
But what happens when your allies learn
that you've been doing the same to them?
To prevent this I demand payment of
one hundred million US dollars in Bitcoin.
Hard wallet delivery.
Stand by for instructions.
He's going.
And there's our bug.
You're sure this guy
is working with Radek?
He can't be doing
this all alone.
Shouldn't we be following him?
Radek would never be dumb enough
to meet Sten in public.
But Sten wouldn't be dumb
enough to leave behind evidence.
Okay. Let's toss this place up
and see what we can work with.
I'll take the office.
Anything?
I've got photos and a map
of Emporiou Square downtown.
How's the workmanship?
It's sloppy. But recent.
This is Greta Becker's phone.
The journalist that was murdered
in Thessaloniki.
Alekos Melas.
"Why the US should
just go home."
The next target.
Come on!
Hey, asshole.
On the ground.
Now.
We just talk.
Ha!
Fuck!
Kate?
Kate? You okay?
Did you take your medicine?
Three hundred hours
of field training.
It's never happened
to me before.
What, the sneeze?
What? No. That wasn't my
fault. He must have had a dog.
I didn't see one.
I froze.
Vail, you... you could
have been killed.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Don't beat yourself up about it.
It happens.
Do you ever get desensitized
by it all?
Yes.
It's Patricio.
He found out where
Alekos Melas will be later.
The next target.
Where?
I'll give you one guess.
Did a quick perimeter check.
Two fat security guards
and a cop asleep in his car.
No sign of Radek.
Shouldn't we warn Melas?
He could be in danger.
Kate, no. We don't want
to spook Radek.
Patricio, you got him, yeah?
So close I can smell
his indigestion.
Four espressos already.
Seems a bit nervous.
Twelve Apostle Church always
was your favorite drop spot.
I love the frescoes.
Even had dinner with
some of the monks
we made Clams Kokkinisto.
That goes against protocol.
Something we were always
very good at.
I meant for the monks.
Oh.
They shouldn't be eating
past midday.
You must be surprised
seeing as I'm supposed
to be dead and all.
Surprised isn't the
word I'd use.
Angry.
More like confused, Victor.
We had a deal. I let
you go, you disappear.
Forever.
Vail, I'm blind.
What do you see?
Vail?
Vail!
I did go away.
But I couldn't help but feel
what's the word you used?
Confused. You see,
we never did find out
who blew my cover.
And I hate mysteries.
It's an itch I've needed
to scratch.
They say old wounds
are best left unscratched.
These don't feel old to me.
Patricio!
You know how efficient I can be.
It didn't take long before all
fingers pointed in one direction.
Putin?
The agency.
That's not possible.
I would have known about it.
Maybe you did.
Maybe that's why I sent some friends
to come and see you in Philadelphia.
Why would the agency
blow your cover?
You know why.
One little assignment
left incomplete.
Even if that's true, Victor
what you're doing isn't right.
Blackmail. Killing journalists.
It's not just extreme,
it's fucking crazy, Victor.
I'm only going to warn you once.
Stay out of the way. If not for
yourself, then do it for her.
Who her?
Your partner.
You weren't able to
protect my family.
You really think you'll be
able to protect her?
Anything?
It's a tablet.
The screen is cracked.
We should still be able to
access the hard drive.
What?
I warned you.
This rope-a-dope
cowboy shit got Melas killed.
This is why we have protocols.
This is why you got
fired once already.
I didn't get fired, I quit.
A man is dead, Vale.
A civilian!
The agency is going to
get heat for this.
Okay, so which one
are we sad about?
The civilian or the agency?
Tell me.
The photo that Radek left
at the scene of the crime.
Who was it?
Luis Del Gato.
Cuban ambassador to the UN.
Del Gato? But he's...
Alive. Which means Radek
doesn't just have a list of past CIA hits
- he has a list of active targets as well.
- We need to call this into O'Malley.
Kate, don't you get it?
O'Malley already knows.
Then why is it just us here?
If this list gets out
it's going to unite the
entire world against us.
Now you're starting to
ask the right questions.
I can think of two reasons.
One: O'Malley is covering
his own ass.
He was station chief
when I was here.
Radek happened under his watch.
Okay, and two?
Think about it, Kate.
Somebody has to be leaking
the info to Radek.
You think O'Malley is the mole?
I don't trust anybody
at the agency.
And you shouldn't either.
But you trust Tye Delson.
You read her in, didn't you?
At the art gallery.
Don't look so surprised.
You knew that I was
tracking you.
You didn't think
I would check the guest list.
See, you do have
the necessary trust issues.
So why won't you direct
them toward the right people?
Because I'm trying to make two
and two equal four with you, Vail.
You keep saying that
we can't trust the agency...
and then you go and read
in the head of station.
None of this makes sense.
Tye is...
She's an old friend.
You're a hypocrite.
Don't answer it.
Fuck you.
Yes, sir.
Kate. Don't tell them.
You really are paranoid,
aren't you?
Yes, sir. Go ahead.
If the CIA is responsible
for these murders
the whole United States
will be held accountable.
Mr. Melas paid the
ultimate price, but his death
his sacrifice
won't be in vain. Thank you.
Christ, Vail.
I'm here for my records.
To my paid vacation.
Kostas suspended all US
intelligence activity in Greece. He's
holding a big press conference Friday
to announce the findings
of his investigation.
Does he have anything?
O'Malley doesn't think so.
But after the hit today at the
market, it doesn't look good for us.
Did you see what happened?
Front and center.
You were there?
I saw Radek. Spoke to him.
And?
Did you know that the agency
blew his cover?
I was briefed when I took
over as head of station.
They said it was a
necessary evil.
It was a crime, committed by
the CIA against one of their own.
From what I understand, the
Russians were responsible for the killing.
Don't you dare let the agency
wash its hands of this.
Look,
Radek made a deal. And then one day, he
refused to hold up his end of the bargain.
You know damn well what they asked us
to do, and you know why we couldn't do it.
I'm not defending them, Vale.
I'm just telling it like it is.
The agency felt betrayed.
Well, I know how that feels.
I waited for you.
I know.
Trains came and went.
I sat on my suitcase
and I waited.
Vail.
I glimpsed faces in the crowd
I kept thinking, they were you.
Oh, here she comes.
There she is.
That must be her.
They never were.
Stop.
You and I were supposed
to get out.
I just... Please.
Why didn't you come?
I... I just
I was scared.
Twenty years I've been
working at this.
This life and all the death
that comes with it.
And it is shitty and
lonely and dreary.
But it's all I know.
When O'Malley called
and offered me the job
it may have been the
wrong choice...
but I have to live with it.
You know, sometimes
the easiest choices
are the ones you don't
have to make by yourself.
When is your meeting
with O'Malley?
Tomorrow.
He's gonna want to know
about the job.
He will.
I can't do it.
The gangsters and the
business freaks, that's
that's one thing, but
the politicians?
I didn't even sign up for this.
I hear you, Victor. But you have
an agreement with the agency.
If you refuse
you're a dead man.
They can rescind their
offer to relocate your family.
We've been here for six months.
If the agency cared about my
family, they'd be gone already.
This puts me in a tough spot.
Not necessarily. This
This could be the out
you've been looking for.
I can't just walk away.
What if you didn't have
to do this alone?
I mean, think about it.
You, me, the girls.
I'll get them out.
No matter what it takes.
I'll see you in Grizzly Pines.
Grizzly Pines.
Yep, I just received it.
I'll be going through them now.
Okay.
Thank you.
Sleeping in?
Yeah. Got the shit
kicked out of me yesterday.
Body needed a reset.
Aren't you on vacation?
I like to think of it
as work from home.
My team was able to trace the
IP address from the ransom video.
Oh wow.
Sent from an abandoned
rail yard rig outside the city.
-I
-What, what?
Forgot to tell you. Patricio
has Radek's tablet computer.
- Vale...
- He's going through it.
He'll let us know if
he finds anything
Patricio couldn't find
flies on a horse's ass.
I need that tablet.
Could have critical information
about Radek's next moves.
My career is on the line.
Oh, your career?
Changes everything.
Vail.
Maybe you should just go home.
Look, if Kostas finds
out you're here...
it'll just prove he was right.
There's too much at stake, I...
Let me send some people
down there.
How are you going to do that?
Your station is suspended,
remember?
Look.
This is something I have to do.
Radek was my friend.
I wasn't able to save his family
maybe I can still save him.
Be careful.
Let me guess.
O'Malley wants me
on the first flight out of here.
I didn't tell him what
happened at the market.
Might not be good
for your career.
Look, it's clear to me that Radek
isn't doing this for the money.
Killing journalists,
the frame jobs.
He wants to punish the CIA.
The money must be for someone
else. But then, then I started to think.
If O'Malley's working
with Radek,
why would he send you?
And that's when I realized.
He wouldn't.
So I went through your bag and I
found a receipt for two burner phones.
One incoming call.
I'm gonna guess that's Radek.
I killed Radek.
Why would I work with him now?
For all I know, you
never killed him.
Maybe you let him go.
Not bad at all.
Come on. We've got to get going.
I am in contact with Radek.
But not for the reasons
you think.
I'll explain all on the way.
Hi, this is Patricio.
Leave a message.
Patricio doesn't miss calls.
Come on.
Stop!
He's bait.
It's a trap.
You de-rig the platform.
Spread yourselves.
No one gets out.
Come on, come on!
We have to get out of here!
Vail!
We need to get out of here.
They're inside.
Kate, get down.
Wait!
Get back! Back!
Kate, back up!
Game over, Torrance.
I give you two options.
One, chuck your weapon
and come in for a chat.
Two, drop dead right now.
I'll take number two,
with you any day.
I knew you'd say that.
Come on.
Release the girl, then
I'll walk over.
No, Vail!
You got ten seconds to come out.
She meets me halfway!
The girl can go,
say your goodbyes, and then
you and I can have a little talk.
I'm sorry, Vail.
Hey,
crying is dying, kid.
We ain't dead yet.
I'm not leaving!
Shut up and listen.
Take the rear door, get
the car and leave.
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- I will meet you at the hotel.
- Don't do this, Vail, please.
- Kate,
go now, or we're both dead.
I tried to tell you.
I'm somebody now.
Yeah. Enjoy it. While it lasts!
I told you to meet
me at the hotel.
I knew Radek was unwell.
I knew the deaths of his family
would be hard on him,
but I never thought
he'd go this far.
What happened to Radek
and the CIA?
How did it get to this?
Radek was too good at his job.
The agency wanted
to promote him.
No more small-timers,
punks, gangsters.
They wanted him to kill
a political rival.
Who?
Kostas. Neither of us
could go through with it,
so we agreed to walk away.
We underestimated how vindictive
the agency could be.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about Patricio.
My fault. I never
should have gotten him involved.
So what now?
What's our next move?
Radek's gone.
He's beyond saving.
No one is beyond saving.
You saw what he did.
I have to find him and end this,
once and for all.
It's O'Malley.
They've agreed to pay
the hundred million.
Good. Radek won't be
able to resist.
US embassies across Europe have
begun evacuating due to safety concerns,
with widespread riots predicted
if Minister Kostas Leontaris
is able to prove a link between
the CIA and these killings.
Tune in here for the live coverage
of the press conference later today.
Vail?
Oh, cut the crap. I was born on
a Tuesday, but not last Tuesday.
I knew you'd run right to her.
You must enjoy this
part of your job.
Secret meetings in back rooms?
Anything for my country.
All right, listen up. Radek has asked
for somebody by name to make the drop.
Anyone else and it's off.
Our rising star,
Bannon.
What?! You can't go.
We have no choice.
Come on, O'Malley. You know
Radek only asked for her to get to me.
You're done, Vail.
Thank you for your service.
Excuse me?
I think it's safe to say you've done
enough damage across this city.
You're out.
O'Malley,
you might be the dumbest son of a
bitch to ever cash a government paycheck
and that's saying something.
Bannon.
You got this?
That's what I'm here for.
He knows our faces.
So, we can't get too
close to you,
but we'll be tracking you
every step of the way.
We've got your back.
Remind me how that usually goes?
It helps to remember
we're the good guys Bannon.
I know who I am, sir.
The Bitcoin is loaded
onto the flash drive.
Once Radek takes possession,
we'll grab him, bring him in.
Three stops, correct?
Affirmative.
Copy that.
I have the package.
Bingo.
I found the tavern.
This is why nobody does
business with the CIA.
They cannot follow directions.
That was a low blow, Victor.
Asking for Bannon?
I thought it was kind of funny.
No. Killing my friend.
I warned you to not
get involved.
Seems like anyone who gets
close to you ends up in the dirt.
So why don't you come down,
collect your money?
You and I can get real close.
Even as we speak.
You can't hide from me, Victor.
I'll never, ever stop coming.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm tired, Vail.
And I want to make peace.
This sure is a fucked
up way of showing it
There's only one
final hit to do.
One assignment.
Kostas?
That's right.
A list is nothing.
They're just words on paper.
But seeing, that is believing.
I'm going to broadcast
to the whole world
what the CIA has been
doing in the shadows
Victor,
you kill him,
countries will go to war,
millions of lives will be lost.
Sadly, as it must be,
I cannot suffer alone
any longer.
Goodbye, Vail.
Please, please tell the
girls I'll be seeing them soon.
Kate, Radek is close by. He got the
payoff he's going to assassinate Kostas.
Get to the back alley. This place is
rigged to blow in about three seconds.
Move over.
Fuck.
We're gonna lose him!
- Brace yourself.
- What?
Brace!
Oh shit!
Come on!
Kate, hey, you alright?
Radek!
As many of you know,
my office has been aggressively
investigating the murders of Greta Becker
and Alekos Melas,
journalists slain on Greek soil.
Many more innocent civilians gunned
down mere weeks after publishing articles
condemning the United States and
its foreign intelligence activities abroad.
Based on our findings,
I can confidently conclude
the Central Intelligence Agency
It's over, Victor.
Do you hear me? It's over.
Maybe for me,
not for you.
You have to relive
this nightmare
forever.
I'm sorry I couldn't
protect them.
Me too, Vail.
I'll see you in Grizzly Pines.
Tye.
No. It's Kate.
Someone shot me.
That would be the Greeks.
But given all the trouble you've
caused them, I'd call you guys square.
You okay?
We found Radek's laptop
in the van.
The Bitcoin wallet wasn't there.
Sounds like there's one
last mystery to solve.
We don't care about the money.
That's what it's there for, to plug holes.
Notice we're watching cartoons
instead of World War III?
That's because Kostas thinks
the CIA saved him.
We took the liberty of
claiming you as our own.
That must have hurt.
We found Radek's
manifesto inside of his van,
claiming he was killing Kostas
on behalf of the CIA.
Plus the entire hit list,
past, present, and future.
So just the truth then, huh?
Truth is subjective.
Thankfully, we found
it before anyone else.
Radek is dead. The
list is secure.
But you did interfere after
we told you to take a hike.
So, all in all,
a job done.
I do have one question.
Why bricklaying?
It's what I know.
Paid for college.
Oh, come on.
You could be making a killing out there
consulting, but you're laying brick. Why?
Because when I hold
a brick in my hand,
I know exactly what it is
and what it will do.
Every single time.
Its form is its function.
That gives me peace.
I don't know what the fuck any
of that means, but it sounds good.
I didn't expect you would.
The money. I mean,
we can't just let him
get away with it.
O'Malley must have it.
He needs to be held accountable.
O'Malley will get what's
coming to him.
Not from us.
So that's it?
We just...
We just let it go?
Kate,
Radek was a complicated man.
But I knew what drove him.
I knew his weaknesses.
Guys like O'Malley,
they live for the politics.
They'll sign a death sentence
as casually as signing a lunch bill.
That's something I'll
never understand.
Kate,
I can't fight an enemy,
I don't understand.
Well, so long, bricklayer.
See you around, kid.
Oh.
What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be at the hospital.
Checked out early.
I was just coming
to see you right before I...
It's been a rough
couple of weeks.
I thought I'd get out
of town for a while.
Why don't I get you a drink?
Sure. Still a little
doped up on painkillers.
Should be a good combination.
Where are you going?
Maldives.
Maldives, sounds exotic.
Never been.
It's my favorite.
I listen to it all the time.

Well, it is your collection.

That's why I'm here, actually.
I'd like to start boxing them up.
If you wouldn't mind
lending me a hand.
Why don't you come with me?
You want me to go with you?
Yeah.
Get out for good this time.
Like we always planned.

That sounds good, Tye, but
you sent me to die.
It's kind of a deal

Really?
So you
and Radek,
you gave him the list.
He came to me. He knew about us.
I didn't have a choice.
So the hundred million
was just for shits and giggles.
You've already donated it to,
what's that charity you like?
Childhood obesity?
I should have left with you.
But I didn't.
And now...
I'm not the same person anymore.
Clearly.
Goodbye, Vail.
You okay?
You're welcome.
I can't believe you thought
I was dirty.
I may be a prick,
but I'm a patriot. I believe
in what we're doing here.
How did you know Delson
was dirty?
Something Vail said to me.
About knowing your enemy.
I knew Tye. She...
She was me.
Still the hell of a clean
up we had to do.
Your persona non grata
in Greece now.
And I'm sorry to say that you're
no longer welcome in this division.
- Sir, I...
- I don't want to hear anything else.
Pack your things.
I'm moving you upstairs.
You're not dismissing me?
You're moving up a floor.
I'm promoting you.
You think I don't know
what a prick Vail is?
You did a great job over there.
You're going to be running
your own cases now.
I'm sorry, but I...
can't accept.
You're kidding me.
I appreciate that, sir, I do.
And I do want to serve
my country, just...
not here.
Thank you.
Hey
Come on. Come on.
Alright, let's go.
I thought you said
you were allergic to dogs.
If you understood everything
I said,
you'd be me.
Bye.
