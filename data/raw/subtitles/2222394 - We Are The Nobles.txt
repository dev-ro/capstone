Let her rest. One of these days
that glass is going to break
Let it break
May God keep her in His glory
Any errands, Margarita?
We're out of cheese
Put it on the card
Keep the fridge stocked
You grew up here?
Yeah, dude
Why did you leave?
Okay. How's this one?
Better
Isn't that movie still in theaters?
Damn it Peter
Put that magazine down and answer me!
Barbie, you know perfectly well
that I hate movie theaters.
They were selling it outside
the sushi place, so don't stir up!
Okay.
Stop speaking like
a Hindi dubbing.
You think it's funny?
Lucho
What are you doing here?
My aunt asked me
to cook for your party.
Happy bday.
What are you bringing
into my house?
A table?
I'm sorry, but I'm not going
to feed my guests...
in that tinfoil-thing
that you call a table.
It comes with a tablecloth.
I wasn't talking to you
Take that thing out of my house
and bring something decent.
- Who is he?
- Nobody. My nanny's nephew
I see why you left.
Can you bring my grapefruit
to my room, please?
Coordinate it properly...
Exactly.
First, trace it from Durango to Mazatlan...
it must be 40 tons..
Then Cualiacan...
Los Mochis and Guasave...
"The greatest salesman of the world
always seeks...
the seed of success in adverstiy... "
- Good morning, Gaby.
- Good morning, sir.
Mr. Javi?
Your dad is here.
Morning, Irma.
- Dad
- Son?
- Have a minute?
- Sure
- German, we have a meeting..
- Hold on.
So, what is like
your worst problem ever?
- I don't know, tell me.
- Loading gas!
You're in a hurry, you have
to pull over, waiting in line...
.. and they don't even
let you speak on your cell..
So, I bring to you:
VIP Gas Stations.
Home Delivery Gas.
You request it from your iPhone
we charge a premium on the service...
.. and take gas
to your house in containers.
Two Slogans:
"Fuel up in your garage"...
.. or "The Gas where you pass".
You mispelled "gas station".
But it's a good idea.
- It's interesting.
- Interesting?
Baby, it stinks!
I'm not gonna finance
these ridiculous ideas any more!
Be patient.
- He's learning.
- He can learn to manage this business!
Alright son, listen.
We are about to win the bid
for a major freeway in Chiapas.
Go to Chiapas. Talk with the head
of urban development...
...tell him you're my son. If you win
this for us, the deal is yours.
I can't. I'm taking a senator
to Miami for my business.
- What for?
- What?
- You spend too much on those trips!
- If we meet the guy in Pemex...
.. you know how much cash
we're gonna make?
- Please!
- Shitloads!
Relax
Son...
This company is your legacy.
Learn how to run it.
Let's go.
Thanks.
I'm gonna kick your ass, bitch.
My dad is giving me shit about working
for him and all this bullshit, man.
Sell your soul instead..
The banks are destroying
our economy.
That's what I told him, but..
You know how he gets.
With the prices they charge..
we might as well work for them.
I'll be right back.
- Miss Lucy, let me help you.
- Charlie, leave me alone.
- Why don't you answer my mails?
- Grow up, will you?
I also thought it was just
gonna be a hit 'n' run, but...
.. I can't get you out of my mind.
You must stop harassing me.
What would happen if someone
finds out what happened?
Tell me.. what happened?
Any messages?
Peter Pintado called to invite you...
...to your daughters'
birthday party tonight.
Peter Pintado? I think he is
your daughter's boyfriend.
Irma, why is this mess on my desk?
Sorry, sir.
We have a new mail boy.
Alberto Dichi called...
...to make an offer
on your father's house.
My father's house...
It's not for sale.
It's rotting away with
the whole neighborhood..
.. but it's not for sale.
- Fine.
- Habibi...
I'll fix it up some day.
Get rid of it.
Anwar, have you seen this?
What?
- My childrens' bills.
- Oh, yeah.
What do you mean
"Oh yeah"?
Why didn't you say anything?
This is insane!
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Of course I did!
And you said: "Give them time,
their mom just passed away. "
Well, yeah.. but...
.. how long ago was that?
Fill the tank, baby.
And you were slow.
- Manuel?
- Martin, sir.
Whatever. Come.
- Who are you?
- Lauren.
Lauren, you're coming to Miami.
We're going to Miami?
No, no. We are going to Miami.
You are going to Chiapas.
Santi.
Go with the head of Urban Development
and give him this in person.
Don't tell anyone I didn't go.
And get yourself something nice.
Yo! Prince!
How's the deal with Pemex?
- Yes.
- Yes, what?
- It'll be settled next week.
- Sure?
Wait to see their faces
when we get it. Suck my balls!
Rock 'n Rolla, bitch!
May we find balance between
masculine and feminine forces...
...here on mother earth..
- Aho!
- Aho!
May our hearts come together.
- Aho!
- Aho!
May we free our souls from
the bonds of capitalism.
- Aho!
- Aho!
May we never forget this.
- Aho!
- Aho!
So I say to him:
You forgot to glaze the duck!
It's so funny!
God, I swear he's like the best!
I love him!
Congratulations!
You look amazing, I swear!
- Thanks.
- Your dress is gorgeous!
- Isn't it gorgeous?
- I know!
Be right back.
- You cooked all this?
- Yup.
You mind?
I almost kill the dog,
then the man tells me...
You're a dear. You did wash
your hands, didn't you?
Lucho, wait!
Let me thank you.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Lucho! It has been
a long time, how are you?
- Indeed.
- It's nice to see you.
Likewise.
- Making your way up, I hear.
- Yes
- Did you prepare all this?
- Yes.
Your aunt has told me.
Don German.
Peter.
Could we..
.. maybe... possibly... find
a place to speak in private?
- Thanks.
- Come on, Cookie.
I'm all ears, Peter.
First of all, Don German...
.. we want to thank you for assisting
to this small rendez-vous..
...that Barbie
and I have put together.
I'm sure you know..
- ...we've been dating...
- You don't mind I clean this, do you?
Not at all.
It's your home, sir.
As I was saying, Barbie and I,
we've been dating for a long time...
.. and I would like to ask for..
...her hand in matrimony.
Well, gee wizz.
How do you plan to support her?
Where do you work now?
Unfortunately,
we just closed a restaurant.
Really? What a shame.
Which one?
Well, it was more a kind
of a Longe than a restaurant.
A what?
Like a Lounge. A...
How long did this restaurant last?
- Like nine months.
- No kidding!
It was like a pregnancy.
Your dad is a hoot..
So what's next?
Barbie and I were thinking
about spending a few months...
.. navigating through Gibraltar
and the Aegean Sea.
For our honeymoon.
And how do you plan
to pay for all this?
Well...
...I'm about to get my part
of mom's trust fund, so...
The trust fund.
But you are aware
that the guardian...
...of that trust fund is me, right?
So?
Barbara, dear, your mother,
may God keep her in His glory...
...left you that fund to invest it
in a house, a business...
...something productive.
I know. That's why we plan to open
a restaurant when we get back.
Darling, you're saying nonsense.
Why?
Because you want to marry a man
20 years older than you...
- Sir, sorry but...
- Allow me!
...who doesn't even know
what the meaning of "work" is.
If everyone had your definition
of work, all families would disappear.
- Here we go again.
- It's truth!
When have you cared what I do?
Never.
And suddenly you mind who
I choose as a husband? It's not fair.
Well, I'm not happy with your choice.
And I remind you
that I'm your father.
Being a father is a verb
not a noun.
Well, you can't marry him.
That's my final word.
Right.
Well, the thing is that I am not
asking for your permission.
Come, Cookie.
Barbara!
Barbara, get back here!
Barbara!
Good evening, everyone!
I have huge news!
Peter just proposed...
...and we're getting married!
Congratulations!
That's the story of my life!
One day we were best friends,
then she makes me wash the carpet.
Some nights I came into my room...
...and she left a box
with a bow on my bed.
I opened it, and it was soap...
.. Other times, her panties.
No kidding!
The next day,
she pretended nothing happened.
I was like a ghost.
You could see her room
from my window.
So she waited until I was in my room,
to get undressed.
No shit!
Just when she was taking off her bra,
she turned the lights off.
- Really?
- I swear!
What should I do?
German!
- Javi didn't go to Chiapas!
- Where is he?
- in Miami.
- Please, no!
He took the plane and sent Martin
by bus with the contracts.
These children
need a tough hand.
I have the College Dean on the line,
he wants to speak to you about Carlos.
Put him through please.
- Hello? German?
- Joe! What a surprise!
- Likewise.
- What can I do for you?
Well, it's about Carlos.
The thing is he got caught having sex
with a teacher in her office.
Fucking hell!
He's not gay!
Joe, you scared me!
Cougars are in vogue these days!
The thing is that he was caught
by the faculty director...
...who took the issue
to the Disciplinary Committee...
...where other issues came up.
what kind of issues?
He skips classes...
...he hands in models
made by your firm...
- You knew about this?
- He has a 5.3 average...
...he was caught
smoking pot by the fountain.
But Joe they're about to legalize it.
What's the big deal?
He doesn't respect any authority
and other students are copying him...
...because they realized
we don't touch your son.
The committee voted to expel him.
Joe, you know my son lost his mother,
may God keep her in His glory...
.. when he was very young.
And that has a profound
impact on teenagers.
I have no way of revoking the decision
of the Committee. I'm sorry.
Thanks for the call, Joe.
Okay.
I'll see you at the club.
Take care.
Get off me.
German?
- Take me to a hospital.
- Irma!
Irma!
My children...
Dad..
- Sweetheart...
- What happened?
He had a mild heart attack.
But he is fine now.
We dissolved the clot
with nitroglycerine.
Isn't what they use
to make bombs?
- What?
- I saw it on "Fight Club".
Take soap, distill it
and you have a bomb.
We are asking aboud dad...
...and you ask about retards
fighting each other?
- It's way deeper than that.
- And Brad Pitt looked amazing.
Personal trainers
prepare them before shooting.
- He was cut in "Thelma and Louise".
- That's his complexion.
Then how did
he get so strong for "Troy"?
They retouched his legs
and he used a butt double.
You can't change your body for
every movie. Look at Renee Zellweger.
Kids, why don't we give
your dad some space?
Ok, Anwar.
Are you fine? You want anything
from the vending machine?
Cheer up, Dad!
Did you see her
in the cover of People?
Not even Photoshop helped.
Can you believe that?
You were right.
- Those kids need a tough hand.
- Told you.
I have an idea and I need your help.
I'll disappear for a while.
- Where will you go?
- To my father's house.
Hold your horses,
we have active projects.
You can't disappear just like that.
- Who's going to handle them?
- You!
Habibi, I'm a salesman,
not an engineer.
Oh, c'mon!
Don't fish for compliments!
You know this business
from top to bottom.
What if an accident happens?
We lose our contracts.
And we are not in the position
to do that.
Listen..
I don't know how much longer
I have before I join Beatrice...
...may God keep her in His glory.
But if I don't teach these morons...
...what life is about...
"Rich grandfather,
millionaire father...
...spoiled grandchildren".
Get it?
That's it, dude!
Pour! Pour! Pour!
I do it, man!
Rum and coke.
Let me introduce you
to the World's Biggest Rum and Coke.
Love you, dude.
Think about it!
Coke and Bacardi sponsor it.
We rent the soccer stadium and
put an industrial container...
We call Guinness Records
and everyone gets hammered...
...from certified glasses
with this label:
"The World's Biggest Rum
and Coke", bitches!
- You're a poet!
- Genius!
You're a visionary, motherfucker!
Chug it! Chug it, bitch!
The Greatest
Salesman in the World
Hey
Have you thought
how you want him to propose?
- In a trip or...
- C'mon! Something original!
Everything is fine?
What is this?
It tastes like glue.
It's goat cheese.
You know? The least I expect
from this establishment...
...is that you refrigerate food
before serving it.
It tastes like cream cheese.
- Sorry. Can I offer you anything else?
- The bill!
Okay.
- Disgusting.
- Jesus Christ!
As we all rub
our hands together...
...we feel the energy flow...
...a tingling sensation.
Once you feel it...
...place your palm close
to your partner's heart...
...without making contact.
Feel that energy flow.
Look right into your partners' eyes.
Feel that serenity,
the exchange of energy.
But don't forget...
I'm sorry.
...those feelings
that are not expressed.
What's up, Irma?
Accept yourselves,
let yourselves free.
Hold up, man!
My phone's ringing!
What's up, Irma?
She told us it was going to be
a super expensive dress..
But it didn't fit.
- It was awful...
- Should I include the tip?
4%
I don't know if it's just a rumor...
You know, people
are really gossipy...
Yeah, I know.
I told her: "Get the money
from your dad"...
I'm sorry miss, but
I must withhold your card.
Excuse me?
Do you have another form of payment?
What?
We are unable
to place your call...
...because your number
has been cancelled.
Irma called from the office,
what's going on?
They cancelled my Black
and my Black!
They cancelled everything!
Have you talked to Dad?
I tried to, but my phone
is cancelled.
- What?
- What happened at the office?
- Your phone was cancelled too?
- Yes! What happened?
Irma said the office
was swamped with agents...
- ... who were confiscating everything.
- And where were you?
At a meeting.
- Guess what happened.
- What?
They withheld my card
and my phone's not working.
Can I have yours?
I need to call Irma.
It's cancelled, Barbara.
She just told me
they were confiscating everything.
And you? Are you learning to eat
or something?
It's called having fun.
Something they don't teach
at your 10 day silent retreats.
Try working. It's something
you haven't done in 10 days.
- And you have?
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
- Where's dad?
- We don't know!
- Don't yell at me.
Are you a journalist
or something?
Get in!
- Get into the house!
- Why did they let them pass?
I'll tell my father.
They can't just come in like that.
- You can't pass.
- We have a warrant.
Please, walk out!
This is private property.
Open the door!
Kids! What's going on?
I don't know. There're like
a battalion out there.
I got a bad vibe about this.
- Open the door!
- Go to the kitchen.
Ok, just calm down.
Everything is going to be fine.
- I'm getting a shotgun.
- No!
- We need to protect ourselves!
- They can't come in! It's illegal!
Right! It's illegal.
They can't come in! We must wait.
They are towing the cars.
I have Peter's gloves in there!
- Barbie, seriously?
- What? They're leather.
- Don't look!
- Kids!
- This way!
- Dad!
- Why are you dressed like Jacinto?
- What happened?
Hurry up!
Why are you so slow?
Okay, okay!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Come, Maggie.
- Let's go!
Let's go!
Why they are taking everything away,
as if we were in Venezuela?
Because they discovered
an embezzlement.
- What's an embezzlement?
- A fraud!
- And now they froze our assets.
- Who? What fraud?
They swapped the preferential stocks
of the market.
By defaulting
the other stockholders' stocks...
...we ended up penniless.
Now the union wants their liquidation.
We don't have any money to pay them,
so they want to throw us in jail.
- Can they do that to you?
- They can do that to us!
You're shareholders too.
You co-own the company.
Strength...
And Anwar fled the country?
- So it seems.
- With the money?
- I don't want to believe it...
- I'm gonna kick his ass!
Where are we going?
We are going to hide in a house
that is not under the company name.
- It was your grandpa's
- Anwar's?
Your grandfather, Javi!
My father!
Why can't we just stay
at a hotel or at aunt Mayte's?
What about my wedding?
What am I going to tell Peter?
You can't communicate with him
nor anybody.
No relatives, no friends, nobody.
Is that clear?
Children, please. I already had
a mild heart attack.
I don't want any problems.
Come on, people!
Just $1!
We're here.
- How much do I owe you?
- $80.
Not you Margarita.
You go home.
You are crazy if you think I'm going
to leave my children here.
Margarita.
My poor baby.
My little princess.
You are absolutely insane if you
think I'm setting a foot in there.
Well, you don't have any choice.
And if we turn ourselves in?
Welcome.
Come in.
Try now.
There's a lot of humidity.
Some paint will leave
this place like new.
Seriously?
Jesus!
Damn cat!
It's a little pussy cat.
There's no water.
Is this all you could afford?
It's all the cash we had.
We?
Ok, he had.
Dad...
...do you know how much
cholesterol you are about to intake?
It's a trick I picked up
at the construction sites.
It tastes like fried eggs.
It tastes good.
- Did you expect oil without fat?
- Oil is fat, Javi.
Yes, but there
are good fats and bad fats
- It depends on your cholesterol...
- Yeah, you read it in Wikipedia.
- At least I read.
- Enough! Please, don't start.
- What are we going to do?
- I've been doing some math and...
We need some money...
...to fix the house,
cover our expenses and eat.
But our cards are cancelled and
we couldn't ask anyone for help.
Where are we going
to get the money?
I think you will have to do something
you've never done before.
Work.
Rise and shine! It's 6 am!
The early bird catches the worm!
- Dirty pervert!
- Get up!
No, I can't believe that...
What's up, prince?
Javi! We partied last night. Your cell
didn't work. Is everything fine?
No man, I'm in deep shit
and we need...
...to kick-start
VIP Gas Stations right away.
Ok, great. What do you want?
Call Taiwan, order the first trucks,
and I need you to cover my share...
- ...I'll pay you with the cash flow.
- Right.
- What about the permits?
- Yeah.
Javi...
Where do you want me
to get the money?
What do you mean?
From your dad, the company.
My dad would never finance
something like this.
Why?
Because Pemex would never
give us the permit.
Do you know the ecological risks?
It's crazy.
What risks?
You all said you liked the idea.
- I still like it.
- We like it but...
...the concept.
We never actually thought
we were going to do it.
So, what was all
those working meetings?
Excuses to hang out and party, man.
At the end of the day, we always knew
we would end up working...
...for our fathers.
I don't know about you, but
I intend to do something with my life.
- Javi!
- Javi!
Javi!
Hello?
Peter!
Barbie!?
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
Where the hell
have you been woman?
Your house is ceased and
the phones are cancelled!
- What's going on?
- Cookie...
- ... we have a huge problem.
- What? Why?
I can't tell you, but we have
to postpone the wedding.
What? You can't just leave me
like this. You owe me an explanation.
What's going on?
Alright, but you
can't tell anyone, okay?
Okay.
There was a derivative of something
with something and Anwar took...
...all our money away because
the union is looking for us...
...and they are seizing
all our properties.
Wait. Are you telling me
they have "sized" your house?
No! They seized our house,
moron!
That's what I said!
Where are you staying?
I can't tell you!
We are hiding!
I need you
to lend me some money, ok?
- How much do you need?
- $5,000 or $6,000.
Hello?
Peter?
Barbie, honey,
there is nothing in the world...
...I love more than helping you.
You know that. but you also know,
I owe the IRS and I'm a bit short...
- Yeah, whatever.
- Barbie, no. Wait!
- Bye.
- Listen, honey...
- Carmen Solorzano?
- I'll call you back.
Mrs. Solorzano.
I'm Carlos Noble.
Sebastian sent me.
- He told me his father...
- I know who you are.
This is your ID, this is Gilberto,
this is your working station.
Training session will be on
Thursday at 8 am.
You start next week.
I wanted to ask you about...
Your connections got you in.
Screw it up and you're gone.
This is not Woodstock.
Cut your hair and shave.
This job was meant for her niece,
but your friend's dad gave it to you.
Don't worry.
She'll get over it in a few days.
EMPLOYEE
OF THE MONTH
- $3,000 dollars?
- Yup.
Not even I make that!
Dude. gimme a break.
I can only pay you $500 dollars.
With these fares, don't you think
you can pay me better?
They are knockoffs.
Excuse me, do you have
a smaller size? I don't know...
- Barbara?
- Ana Paula?
- It's sad, don't you think?
- What?
That people have to wear
knockoffs to be in style.
What's that?
I bought a movie tickets with
my membership card and I scalped them.
And you?
I pawned Javi's watch.
What's wrong with you?
It was a Bvlgari!
Sorry, I panicked.
Stop Javi, calm down.
I need you to make a better effort.
Why are you taking him out?
Leave him here.
You want me to feed a cat?
- It's impossible to find a job, Dad.
- The crisis is hitting hard.
How are we going to get food?
I've already supported you
your whole lives.
And now what?
I don't matter, right?
I got something.
You?
Mr. German?
Are you at home?
- Take this to the kitchen.
- This doesn't end here.
Thank you for coming Margarita.
But what are you doing here?
We brought some clothes, sheets,
towels, that Lucho put together.
You're very kind.
But it wasn't necessary.
And some money.
What? Are you crazy? No way!
I won't accept any money.
Excuse me sir...
...but they are my children,
and I will not leave them astray.
- Thank you, Maggie.
- Wait a minute!
- I run the finances here.
- This was mine, man.
Isn't there...
...anything for me?
Yeah... I couldn't find
women's clothing.
Oh! But I brought you this.
Soap?
- Ha ha, very funny.
- Don't you want them?
- Here.
- I do! I do! Thank you.
- How are you, dear?
- Bad. I can't get a job.
Didn't your niece
just quit the cantina?
Margarita, they can find
a job on their own.
Thank you very much.
It doesn't matter. I'm sure
they'll love someone like my Barbie.
Alright.
Thank you.
Hey, man!
Got anything for me?
Turn off that goddamn music,
moron!
What's wrong with you, dude?
Damn!
Sorry, sorry! It was his fault!
Goddammit!
TRY TO PASS ME...
YOUR SISTER!
What's your problem, bitch?
Why do you cut me off?
I'll kill you, fucker!
Bring it, bitch!
No! Hey!
May I ask for your fare, please?
Hey!
- Let's go! Time is money!
- That's why I want my payment!
How amazing, don't you think?
No women's clothing...
I couldn't guess
your size and style.
He spat on the plate!
You see that?
Lucho! Where did you bring me?
Listen, you are here because of
my aunt and your dad.
Do you want to work?
It's time to wash, princess.
Mr. Rodrigo?
Afternoon.
This girl needs work.
Thought she could take
Mariana's place.
She's willing to serve and clean.
Job is taken, but she can
have the tips... if she wants.
Fine, that works.
Thank you!
You can change here.
Grab a locker.
There's your uniform.
Lucho, come here!
Are you nuts? I'm not getting naked
in front of these people.
Why? Now that bothers you?
What do you mean "now"?
What are you talking about?
When you changed by your window
so I could see you?
What? Darling, I think
you're confused! You wish!
Why would I get involved with you?
Poor thing...
You thought
I was trying to seduce you?
You wouldn't know
what to do with me.
Listen Barbara!
You're not in charge here, right?
All you have is because of me,
got it?
So change that tone
and get to work
I'm more of a man than
all those sissies you've dated.
- Good afternoon.
- Why is her Majesty here?
My aunt had me against the wall.
Besides, Mr. German
always helped me out.
Is this a joke?
Why?
I'm not going out there
looking like a slut.
That didn't bother you before.
Cocksucking bitch!
- What's wrong with you, asshole?
- Careful, moron!
Sorry! It wasn't my fault!
TRY TO PASS ME...
YOUR SISTER!
I have women
and children here, asshole!
I'm gonna kick your ass!
Fuck!
- Asshole!
- Moron!
What's up?
What is this?
I just asked for some food.
Some tacos...
Compliments from Mr. Anwar.
Okay.
Leonor wants that position...
Finally!
Her boss is terrible...
Waitress!
Did I order soup or gazpacho?
We've been waiting for half an hour
and this is cold!
Sorry, I'm not the chef,
I just serve the food, ok?
Why don't you eat it then?
Let's go.
Excuse me?
Whatever.
This broad just crossed
the line, man!
What's this?
The plates on Lucho's bus are forged!
They took all my money!
You are moving
from bad to worse.
- Why?
- Because you can't negotiate.
This is embarrasing.
Barbara!
Table 16. In the cantina.
Table 16
What's wrong with you?
Can't you see where
the hell you're going?
Who spilled the food?
No way! You hit me!
- You spilled the food?
- No!
- Food supply! A week!
- It was my fault, sir.
Perfect! You can go too.
And clean that up!
Relax!
- Why didn't you sell this house?
- Cause it was my dad's.
- But it's falling apart.
- So is the neighborhood
- Why don't they sell their houses?
- Well, sentimental value.
Besides, they don't give you...
GERBEA WINS
CHIAPAS CONTRACT
Check it out! Maradona wants
to play the World Cup again.
- I was reading that...
- And as a goalie!
- See you, Charlie.
- See you.
Why is file 84 separate from 85?
Well... I have class...
Good evening, Carmen.
I warned you. Screw it up
and you're gone. Grab your things.
I thought they were together.
It was an accident.
I don't care! I'm not losing
my job because of you.
Please, don't fire me!
I need the job. Please.
It's too late.
It's not.
You haven't sent the reports.
I need the job.
So, what do you propose?
Whatever you say.
But I really need the job.
You tell me what we should do.
Look...
If I do this, I will put my job
in jeopardy...
...for someone
who clearly isn't qualified.
What will you give me in return?
Lucho, don't!
What are you doing?
Oh... Sorry!
Can you clean it again?
That's not good for cats.
I can't keep eating like this, dad.
I need protein.
- I'll be back.
- If you want better food...
...improve your income.
This is all I can afford.
I have a fixed income.
What else can we do?
I don't know,
get a second or third job.
You can do more shifts, Javi.
Barbara is bringing peanuts.
I drive a bus for 12 hours.
You could order some sushi.
Sure! Or seafood!
You think I eat lobster everyday?
You want a new mattress,
hot water...
You're the one who's always
complaining about...
- Holy shit!
- Shut the door!
- What were you doing?
- My earring fell in the toilet.
Earring, my ass.
- When did you start doing that?
- Doing what?
Don't pretend!
For how long have you forced
yourself to throw up?
What's wrong with you?
Food is expensive!
Do you know how many
calories we just ate?
Enough, damn it!
How long?
Since boarding school.
Since France?
8 years?
- Did you know about this?
- Of course not.
I did.
And why didn't you tell me?
Why nobody tell me?
- When? You were never around.
- Please!
We had to schedule
an appointment with Irma.
- And she never answers.
- See?
Don't pull that shit!
This is very serious.
So is this. Where were you
on my graduation day?
You didn't make it.
Where were you when Javi almost
got expelled from high school?
- You didn't know?
- He knows now. Thanks.
Or when Charlie had mono,
where were you?
So now it's my fault!
Come here, Barbara!
Do you want to blame me
for forcing yourself to puke?
Fine.
Do you want to blame me?
It's fine.
But it doesn't change the fact
that you chose to do it.
And it doesn't change the fact
that in 8 years...
...you didn't come close knowing.
- Come here!
- Leave me alone!
Open it.
God bless you!
This is unfair!
Can you explain me why they whistled,
and threw lemons at me?
It's a tradition.
They used to ban soldiers, women
and dogs from all the cantinas.
- What a pathetic folklore!
- Now they allow dogs
This place looks like Thailand!
Every restaurant in the city
stocks up from here.
- You come here everyday?
- Yup.
- And you also own a bus?
- That's right.
- And you're a cook?
- That too.
So you are like, all of Cantinflas'
characters bundled into one.
And now you can play
"Warehouse Barbie".
Didn't my dad help you
to buy your bus?
No, I borrowed for a CD stand.
When I controlled the block,
I bought the bus.
You did know that your CD stand
is controlled by drug dealers?
- C'mon, Barbara Walters!
- Really!
You are aware that you're aiding
the criminals of this country?
The crimininals are your friends!
- What? Who?
- What do you mean "who"?
The two guys at your party?
Those politicians' children?
Didn't you see the videos?
Everyone did.
Are you concerned
about the country?
Don't feed them, or invite them.
Don't go on their yachts.
You have your gangs
and we have ours.
- Come on, damn it! Push!
- I am pushing!
Push harder!
- Peter...
- Yes?
Didn't you go out of bounds on 7?
Still on the same subject?
Pay up already, you cheap skate!
- Here. Share the tip.
- OK.
- Hey
- Yes?
Well... I hate to do this, but...
...you were responsible
for the taxes of the restaurant.
IRS called me, and I want to know...
What's up with the money?
What do you think?
Nothing.
Barbara was getting her father
to sign off on the trust fund...
...but now that she disappeared,
I'm setting up a loan...
- We're all good.
- And your money?
Are you serious?
- Peter?
- Marijose!
Hi! Why haven't you called?
Another one.
Another what?
What a scumbag!
Why don't you ask Barbara,
to get some money from her father?
It's not the first time
a business goes bad.
I'd love to.
But I don't know where she is.
What happened?
Don't say you don't know anything.
Fine. But you can't tell anyone, ok?
Ok.
Apparently they had
a problem with the union...
...and the partner fled
with the money of the company.
Who?
Anwar?
Yeah. And the union
seized their properties...
...so they are hiding from the police.
Anwar Kaim?
I don't know his last name, but there
can't be many Anwars in the world.
His name is Anwar Kaim, and
he hasn't fled anywhere. He is here.
- In Mexico?
- No man!
There!
- Bye, Alex!
- Bye!
Holy shit!
Come.
Two "birrias", please.
- What's that?
- You don't know it?
You are going to love it!
- I see some tasty meat!
- What a chick!
Have you tried it with lime?
It tastes really good, try it.
Carlos?
- Yes?
- Would you help me file this?
2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
There. Your three and my three.
You're giving me $50 extra.
- Sorry.
- I need it to fix the part you broke.
It wasn't my fault!
Yeah, but if we don't fix it,
neither of us makes any money.
It's not fair, Lucho!
I was on my lane!
TRY TO PASS ME...
YOUR SISTER
20 dudes were catching up
and police cars came from the left...
He's calling you, dude.
- Is this thing yours?
- He's tough guy!
- Come on!
- He really is!
- What's it to you?
- Is it?
Yeah, So?
No kidding, dude!
- Watch out who you're messing with
- I had women and children, asshole!
- That's my merchandise!
- I don't even know you, Hellen Keller!
- I'm the one you keep cutting off!
- Well, who's your daddy?
- What?
- Are you reading that book?
Yeah, so?
When I bought it I saw that...
"VIP Gas Stations", Javier Noble.
Did you work there?
No, man.
I had that project,
but my partners backed out.
They lacked vision.
What was it about?
Nothing...
C'mon! I'll tell you
about my project.
Ok.
What is your worst
problem in the world?
A broad in my hometown
says her son is mine...
...and she wants me
to send her money.
I ask her to prove it, but she can't.
So, I don't send money...
...and she sends her cousins
to beat the shit out of me.
So I went with my guys
to get those sons of bitches...
I got it! What you need
is a gang of bodyguards!
- No, let me...
- This was different. It was...
- People hate loading gas, right?
- Yes.
We could solve that, you call us
from an app on your iPhone...
...and we deliver the gas
wherever you were.
Your house, your office, anywhere!
We could charge 10% of the sale.
I was...
...Home Delivery Gas!
It's golden! I mean...
Damn, Bones!
That's the dumbest shit
I've ever heard!
Do you think we would pay more
just to avoid a gas line?
Don't you know the price of gas?
You should be thinking about
a titty bar or a titty joint!
Not that bullshit to throw
your money away... Shit!
Hey!
I'm Javi.
Nice to meet you, Bones.
VIP Gas Stations, my ass!
In my neighborhood you get shot
for saying something like that!
Paycheck... and $300 in tips.
Tips.
Sorry, there seems to be a mistake.
I made $420 in tips.
- Lucho!
- There's only $280 here...
I don't need Lucho for you
to give me the other $140.
Tell your girlfriend how things
work around here, or she's out.
- Yes, sir.
- Just a moment.
He is not my boyfriend and
I'm not going anywhere...
...until you give me my $140.
Lucho!
Next!
- Wait till I'm done with that Q-Ball!
- Shut up!
- I'm gonna sue him!
- Shut up!
- He owes me $140!
- No, he don't!
You didn't meet the quota!
What quota?
I earned those tips! They're mine!
What about us, in the kitchen?
The ones who wash the dishes...
...or clean the floors?
We split the tips with everyone.
Great! So now we're in Cuba!
Do you know how much they left me
on a $70 dollar bill?
- $5 dollars!
- You slam their dishes on the table!
They ask you for the bill and
you huff and puff! What is that shit?
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Barbara, don't cry.
- You hate me.
- I don't.
- You treat me like a pest!
- What did you expect?
Really?
Don't you think you deserved it?
Isn't that what you liked about me?
Listen...
Regarding the tips...
Serve the customer
the way you like being served.
Flirt with them!
You know how...
- C'mon. Let's go back in.
- I don't want to!
That Q-Ball pays the bills.
So let's go...
I'm done. I'm off to bed.
Here we go...
How are we doing?
$600 over.
- Javi?
- Yeah.
- This is wrong, son.
- Why?
You wrote $1,340
but it's $1,430.
Yeah, right.
Guess I was tired. Sorry.
Why did you write "Tolat"
instead of "Total"?
Yeah, that always happens...
You mix the "T" and the "L"...
You spelled "Brabara"
instead of Barbara.
Yeah, so?
Dad, I'm dyslexic.
- What do you mean dyslexic?
- I went to therapy.
When?
You paid for it!
- Sure, but Saul treated dyslexia?
- Yes! What did you think?
That you went to therapy.
- Of course! Their mother died...
- God keep her in His glory.
Send 'em to a shrink.
You know what?
I've had it with all your bullshit!
I would love to see you become
father and mother...
...from one day to the next.
I was obviously uncapable of
covering all your needs on my own.
- Why didn't you remarry, then?
- For your sake!
She left! She left us!
Not me!
I handled the situation.
And all you do is complain...
You bitch, and you moan...
Charlie, I'm off to class.
Wait.
Look out for Carmen, will you?
Carlos? I need today's final reports.
I've been a naughty girl, and...
...I deserved a punishment.
Where were you?
Working.
This late?
Yes.
You are lying.
I was with someone.
- Someone?
- Yes. Someone.
From the opposite sex?
- Where do you find the appetite?
- Barbara!
- What?
- This is no subject for conversation.
I'm your father.
Who was she?
- My boss...
- Sweet!
Boys!
- Is she hot?
- Javi!
I just wanna know
if she was hot!
She's a bit older, but the uniform
gives her... something...
Your sister is here!
Oh dad, please!
Who do you think I am?
- I don't want to know.
- Dad...
Where do you think I was
when I "slept over" at Mara's?
I don't want to know! Please!
- I do! Tell me!
- Remember "Woody"?
- The big guy?
- Wasn't he gay?
Zero. Why do you think
they called him "Woody"?
Enough!
Don't freak out! Tell us something
about you! About your first time!
- What?
- Yes! Tell us!
- No way!
- Yes, tell us!
- Tell us!
- Tell us!
Tell us!
Everybody does it!
We had to know at some point!
I was 14 years old and I had
a neighbor called Carmen.
We called her "The Blimp".
She was older than me...
Throw it, dude!
Throw it, dude!
We get the sodas!
You lost!
Eat me!
Hey!
Don't you speak English?
I asked for red sauce, not green.
I'll change it right away.
- Fuck! Now my tacos will get cold!
- I'll be back in a sec.
I understand. I will have more
people looking into this.
I give you my word.
We are doing our best...
You have our top engineer on this
Excuse me? Are you Anwar?
Yes.
No. I can't. In five weeks.
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm Barbara Noble's boyfriend...
I'll call you back.
Today, our cantina celebrates
70 years making people happy.
And like every year, we celebrate
with our clients and employees.
So let's celebrate!
Congratulations!
Music!
Drag your butt over here, darling!
Floor vs Kitchen.
Here we go, guys!
Your attention, please!
The loser.. Listen!
The loser cleans up afterwards.
On three. 1, 2, 3.
There, there!
- Lucho...
- What?
- Really?
- Yup.
What?
Weren't you a real man?
Let him thru, you moron!
He's talking to you, monkey!
And you look like Princess Fiona!
Who dismounts an engine
in the middle of the base?
Unbeliavable!
They could do it in that lot,
instead they do it here!
- Where?
- Over there.
Move, fatty! Let them thru!
Grab your crap and leave!
Hey man?
We could rent it and
charge for parking.
Yes, and you'll call it
VIP Parking.
There is plenty of space.
Sure, dude!
With what money?
Let's go, Donald Trump.
Jorge, $350.
- You think she...
- Shhh!
Luis Mendez.
Barbara, $750 of your payment...
...and $380 in tips.
At what time are you done?
I have the night shift.
Look me up when you're done?
Yup.
- You scored...
- Shhh!
- There?
- No.
It's okay, dad!
It's hot now!
Done!
Peter!
What are you doing here?
How did you find us?
Where's Barbie?
You plan to stay here?
You'll never guess
who I ran into at the club.
A really good friend of yours,
a nice guy.
Anwar?
You know?
You are doing an
excellent job with your family.
I mean it.
If more parents would stop their
children's uncontrollable spending...
...this country
would run much better.
Better men have tried to extort me.
Extorting you, Dad?
No way!
I just want to help you!
Can you imagine
if your children found out..
...that you made up this whole farce
just to teach them a lesson?
What do you want?
I want your daughter's hand
and a bit of the inheritance.
Forget it.
You won't have any of them.
German, I'm trying to give you
a clean exit from all of this.
Your children are already hurt by
their mother's death...
...and your absence, just to find out
that this whole thing is a lie.
Can you imagine the damage
on their sense of trust in the world?
You don't want me
as an enemy.
No! On the contrary!
I want to be your friend,
your partner...
...the person that continues
what you started.
- My grandpa said...
- Enough!
- "A lot of money, a lot of problems".
- Get out!
- I want those problems.
- Out! Now!
- Do we have a deal?
- Shut up!
Peter!
What are you doing here?
My darling!
How I've looked for you
since we last spoke!
Peter!
What are you doing here?
Guys, listen for a sec.
After hanging up with Barbara...
...I convinced my uncle to put
our properties as a collateral...
...to negotiate your debt
with the union.
Until they finally agreed.
And that means...?
That your money
has been unfrozen...
...your accounts
are reactivated...
...and that you can return
to your normal lives...
Wait!
I don't get it...
- I thought you didn't care about me.
- Darling, on the contrary!
I just wanted to help you.
Whoa! Wait! I'm lost, dude!
What about Anwar?
He fled with the money, so that
he could keep negotiating power.
But he's back.
Everything is fine now.
Actually, he asked me
to come get you.
We're back!
Would you hold Coco for me?
What's up, Lucho?
What's going on?
Nothing. We are leaving.
The problem is solved.
You were our lifesaver, right?
Thanks.
Sure, man.
Leaving without goodbye?
No.
Will I see you tomorrow at work?
Lucho.
Lucho!
Where are the foreclosure seals?
- I had them removed, son.
- And the cars?
The cars are here?
My car?
Oh, my car!
My sweet car!
There, my love.
Problems are over.
We can now continue with
the wedding and our lives.
Come.
I love you.
You fucking traitor!
Barbara will marry that scumbag
because of you!
- What are you talking about?
- He is blackmailing me!
If I don't put him in Barbara's trust,
he'll tell them everything.
- What?
- Still want to talk business?
He caught me in the lobby,
he already knew everything.
What could I do?
He said he missed her.
Of course he misses her!
of course he does!
She is his golden ticket!
Can't you see it? For God's sake!
That one.
That one!
Really?
What's wrong?
I was with someone.
- Gross! From the cantina?
- No!
Who?
- Who?
- Lucho.
Lucho?
Lucho! My nanny's nephew!
We used to put soaps on his bed.
- Lucho!
- "Cry Baby Lucho"?
- Yes.
- God!
Barbara!
I don't even want to know
what you two did.
- No!
- Obviously, I want to know...
...but you'll tell me
the details later. Look...
Do you have any idea
what you have with Peter?
How many people would give up
a property to save you
and your family from
the problem you were in?
Trust me,
I've had itches and wishes...
...but you don't leave
a man like Peter just like that!
Especially for a Lucho.
Not for anyone!
Barbara!
Peter loves you.
Of course.
You are absolutely right.
However, if you have doubts,
we could cancel or...
No, you are absolutely right.
Forget it.
So, this one?
Dad.
This document certifes
that Pedro Pintado Marquez...
...born in Cholula, Puebla
on October 15th, 1968
...as the adjacent beneficiary
of the trust fund...
...with the file number 04534D4
You're from Puebla?
- Will my social security card do?
- Yes, sir.
If you will.
You should know this fund
is a common ownership.
It will not be yours
until you marry Barbara.
If that ever happens.
Or...
Name your price
and leave us alone forever.
You made me jump over
that fence for nothing.
Margarita.
I don't know what to do.
It's not that I'm afraid
of the children getting angry.
I think that Peter guy is right.
With what confidence
can you go thru life...
...if you can't even trust
your own father?
They are stronger than you think.
But you can't let Barbara
marry that Peter guy.
Instead...
...tell them everything.
You think they would forgive me?
There's love behind what you did.
They'll see that in time.
But..
...you'll have to pay a penitence
for deceiving them.
What worries me
the most is...
What if they need more time
to forgive me than what I have left?
The longer you wait to tell them...
...the longer
they'll take to forgive you.
Where are we going?
Peter!
Surprise!
You're crazy!
Where are we?
Honey, let me show you
our new business.
What? What is it?
The question
is "What will it be".
A Basque restaurant.
Let's see...
In this...
In a building?
Of course! It's more exclusive.
And we are all partners.
Cheers!
Well, this is not exactly
what I had in mind...
- Honey...
- But...
If you don't like it, we drop it.
No, no. I love it.
I love what you are doing...
But...
- ... I don't...
- Listen...
If you don't like the place
or the business, then we drop it.
What I want...
...is that everything we do,
from now on, we do it together.
That's why I want to ask you...
...to marry me...
Yes. But are we already
getting married.
I know, but now.
I want us to go to City Hall.
Wait, no. But...
I can't.
- I want my family to be there.
- And they will be.
We'll do the religious wedding
and even a party, right?
- Sure!
- Of course!
But this must be our moment.
Barbara Noble...
...I think I've proven
that I will never leave you.
That I love you.
I want our life to be great adventure.
And I want it to start right now.
Let's go.
What is this?
Let me to introduce you
to Rubi and Mitzi.
They go with Peter.
They pick him up and
we take pictures of them in a hotel...
...and we give that scumbag
24 hours to leave the country...
...or we show the pictures
to Barbara.
Girls, would you give us a minute?
I won't keep solving things like that.
I'm going to tell the truth.
So you plan to tell them
that you lied...
...and put them to work
because you thought...
...they were a lazy bunch of morons?
Not exactly with those words,
but I'm going to tell the truth.
Javi, come to my office, please.
And tell your brother
I want to talk to him too.
Thanks, son.
They're going to kick your ass.
I can't believe what I'm doing.
It's my dad.
Here. Let me.
- Hello, dad!
- Peter?
In the flesh.
- Put Barbara thru.
- I'm afraid we can't right now.
But let's have dinner tonight.
We have a surprise...
Put Barbara
on the phone right now!
Great! Ciao!
- What did he say?
- He wanted to have lunch.
Why don't you turn it off?
After all, this is our moment.
Okay.
Peter.
Peter?
On the phone!
Hello?
Mara, Peter is hiding
Barbara from me.
Do you know where they are?
Sorry, but he is organizing a surprise
and they don't want anyone to know.
Dear, it is very important
that you tell me the truth.
Where are they?
They are getting married
in City Hall.
Oh my God!
Weren't you talking with Peter?
- Hi. We want to get mar...
- End of the hall.
Could you at least
tell us what's going on?
Your sister is about
to make a huge mistake.
- Why? What is she doing?
- I'll explain later.
- I want to talk to the three of you.
- I'll drive.
- No.
- You want to get there or not?
Okay. You, on the back!
- Where are you going?
- Hurry up!
Let's go, son!
We're up, c'mon.
- Hello.
- Afternoon.
Can we see the judge?
We want to get married.
Your Honor?
How many times have
I told you to knock?
- A couple wants to get married.
- Coming.
- Let's signal, dad!
- Okay!
Sorry!
Do you have your
birth certificates...
...and all your documents?
We don't.
May I have a word with you?
I'll be right back.
- Why is Peter's car here?
- Can you tell us what's going on?
- Peter is fooling Barbara.
- I'm gonna kick his ass!
Pedro...
...Pintado...
...born in?
Cholula, Puebla.
I did my bachelors
in Salamanca.
- Excuse me? Weddings?
- End of the hall.
The secret to a good marriage...
still remains a secret!
- Weddings?
- Yes, it's here.
Someone under "Noble"
getting married?
One moment.
Yes.
Where is she?
- In the patio.
- In which patio?
There are two ways. One is confusing
but shorter, and the other...
- Either one, miss!
- The easy one! Quick!
Marriage is a sacred institution...
But who wants to live
in an institution?
Upstairs to your right,
go to the second patio...
...and cross.
There's a patio
on the top of another patio?
That's not possible, miss.
Where is she?
When you are going to sleep,
never go to sleep angry...
...stay up fighting all night long.
Small tip. Free of charge.
Any how...
Can you sign the papers, please?
My sciatica!
Yala! Ruj!
- What?
- Go! Run!
There she is!
- I can't.
- Barbara! Don't sign that!
Dad?
What are you doing here?
Stop speaking like a Spaniard,
you are Mexican! Don't sign!
- It's downstairs.
- Let's go!
- What did he say?
- I don't know.
What are they doing here?
- This guy is an impostor!
- What?
We never had a problem with the union.
He didn't save us from any union.
In fact...
...we don't have a union.
What do you mean? What...?
- There was never a fraud...
- What?
- ... nor an embezzlement.
- What?
We were never broke.
But...
What about the cops
and the tow trucks...
...and the foreclosure signs, dad?
All that was a set-up...
...planned by me.
- What's wrong with you?
- Are you crazy?
Saner than ever.
This scumbag tried to blackmail me
after he learned about the set-up.
He only wants your money, Barbara.
He doesn't love you.
- What's going on here?
- His pressure dropped.
What do you mean it was a staged?
Why did you do that?
Honestly,
you were leading lives that...
- ... had me worried.
- What?
Don't you remember
your lifestyles?
You were expelled for bribing
and sleeping.
with your teachers.
And you?
Throwing money away
on bad business ideas.
Undermining everything I ever
gave you. Your own company!
And you?
Well, you were...
You were going
to marry a gigolo!
Just to spite me?
But why did you do all this?
I mean...
Why didn't you cancel
our credit cards...
- ... or fire me?
- Because you are my son.
You knew I was expelled
from school.
Why didn't you just talk to us?
Honestly? I felt you were lost.
- After the heart attack I panicked...
- Wait.
Was I part of a negotiation
between you and Peter?
What a coward!
Rock on.
German...
...let's go.
Now what?
I can't believe what he did.
I don't want to see him again.
- Where will you go?
- I don't know. Aunt Mayte's...
Grandpa's... I don't know.
So you won't talk to him, but...
- ... you will live in his house?
- We fixed it up!
That gives us
some right over it, doesn't it?
We'll pay him rent.
We continue working,
we invest the trust funds...
Javi?
You still have your trust fund, right?
Javi!
Do you remember
"Executive Motorcycle Cabs?"
Javi, are you kidding?
I didn't know
it rained so much in April!
He played us for idiots
for two months.
What do you expect?
He is the ultimate Puppet Master.
I think it was brilliant lie...
Cut the zen philosophy, will you?
I want to hate him for a while!
- Pay the man...
- You have the coins.
Life's ironies...
I wanted my children
to be independent...
...and now that they are...
.. they won't talk to me.
My "Javisness"!
Why don't we take
the plane to Acapulco?
- I can't. I'm working.
- Doing what?
- A business.
- That's my Javi! What's it about?
Executive Moto Cabs?
Whatever it is, we'll do it!
It's a strip bar
for guys with a fat-fetish.
Javi finally found
his longed-for partner.
When can your mother come
for an audition?
Not his old friends.
Polish that up, dude!
We won't pay you
for doing nothing!
They opened up their car shop.
Of course,
he gave it his personal touch.
PIMP MY BUS
Titties! Titties!
Titties! Titties!
Get out! Get out!
You've got some balls.
- Beaner.
- Slut.
Barbara and Lucho
finally got together.
I didn't know they liked each other
since childhood, but it makes sense.
After all, they grew up
in the same house.
Cha...
Get a room.
Charlie is finally dating
someone his own age.
If they won't sell the land, wait till
they see us coming with clubs!
Food is ready!
Happy birthday!
- Did you cook it?
- Yup.
I helped Barbie to cook
the lasagna.
Actually, I'm still surprised
with how little I knew about them.
Wake up habibi!
Green light.
At least I got them
to build their own lives.
As for me...
Baby, I got you something.
Sweetie...
What... is it?
I'm not falling for it.
Happy birthday, dear.
Javi!
Charlie!
Come!
I wanted to give you a lesson...
...but you gave it to me instead.
Pop.
Come in.
Let's party!
It feels like a cheap funeral!
This is unfair!
I want to talk to the judge!
I'm gonna sue you!
You don't know who I am!
Come back!
This is an outrage!
What a pretty Spaniard!
A tasty jamon serrano!
- Hi gorgeous!
- Hello!-
- Easy, guys!
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Puebla.
- We're gonna welcome you.
This is the honeymoon suite, dear!
