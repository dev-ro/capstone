Look. This is a big claim. The cops
want to nail the guywho stole it too.
The difference is we have to make good
the 30, 000 bucks. They don't.
To them it's another heist.
Or, has the owner stashed it
away someplace,
and is she trying to defraud us
out ofa lot ofmoney?
Ifyou have large sums
of cash around the house,
wewould insist on certain
alarm and security precautions,
which my supervisor
would have to approve.
Whatwe usually do in a case like this
is handle the installation ourselves.
Sweetheart, can I getyou?
John, can I botheryou for a minute?
- I haven't had lunch yet.
- What doyou want?
Let me have a cherry cheesecake, a prune
danish and a couple of Hershey bars.
And I should have something sweet. Let
me have some chocolate-covered raisins.
- I found the missing Picasso.
- I don't believe it.
I-- It's at Galaxy Opticals.
They cut the thing out ofthe frame.
They rolled the canvas up,
and it's in one ofthe telescopes.
- How'd you figure it out?
- It wasn't easy.
I'm supposed to be looking
for a picture ofa woman with a guitar.
But it's all little cubes.
It took me two hours to find the nose.
- You should call the cops.
- Yeah, right away.
Would you excuse me?
Rosie, would you get me the fingerprints
on the Leland claim?
- Whowon the sixth race at Aqueduct?
- Your horse came in seventh.
Seventh? Never bet on a horse
who has Parkinson's.
Congratulations. I heard
you recovered the stolen Picasso.
- Yeah, congrats on the art burglary.
- It was a breeze.
C. W., I broughtyou something
till your order gets here.
Thankyou.
You want to be my date tonight?
- What's tonight?
- George's birthday.
- We're taking George out.
- All right. I'd love to.
Butyou have to have me home
and in bed by midnight.
That's exactlywhat I was planning.
[Man] MyGod, that girl's got
a bodythat won't quit.
Quit? It won't take
five minutes offfor a coffee break.
- Oh, Briggsie, I forgot to tell ya.
- What?
- Hey, where are my-- Rosie!
- What?
- Where are my files? Where's my files?
- They're moved.
- What do you mean moved?
- They're all moved.
- Why?
- They're streamlining.
- This is Fitzgerald?
- Who else?
Did you take the files
out of my office?
Would you like to go out and try
coming back in like a human being?
- Did you move my files?
- Ifyou don't like the human
idea, come in like an orangutan.
- That would be a step up too.
- Put them back... now-- this instant.
You knew we were
rearranging this floor.
Take my files--
Put them back in my office now.
You had plenty oftime
to transfer them yourself.
Fitzgerald, ifyou were a man,
I would slam you in the teeth.
IfI was a man,
you'd be hiding underthe desk.
- This is whatyou do
when I giveyou an order?
- Give me an order? You?
Who doyou think I am,
some peroxide little stenographer...
with her brains in her sweater
whose rear end you pinch?
Pinch it?
I couldn't get my arms around it.
I don't take orders from you.
I work directlyfor Mr. Magruder.
We're in the process
ofturning this place around.
I've been working here 20years.
You're here six months.
I'm not interestedin
your ideas about turning--
Get my files. Put 'em back now.
- Or what?
- " Or what? "
This is the question
you ask me? "Or what? "
"Orwhat? "
Are you saying "orwhat" to me?
Ifyou don't get off my toe,
you're going to be singing
castrati with a glee club.
I... hated you, Fitzgerald, from
the dayyou set foot into this office.
You'd hate anywoman who doesn't have
a double-digit I. Q
I'm a good judge of character.
I hateyou, and I hate the chancellor
ofGermany...
with the little mustache,
but not in that order.
Be careful when you leave.
Don't let the door hityou on the back
and fractureyour pelvis.
So, didyou tell her who's boss?
Is she kiddin',
talkin' to me like that?
It's 'cause she thinks she's smarter.
'Cause she graduated from Vassar,
and I went to driving school.
Does she have any idea
how many cases I cracked here?
Never trust a woman who
whistles for her own cabs.
[Boy]
Excuse me. Miss Fitzgerald?
- Is that Miss Fitzgerald's lunch?
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry we're so late. We're jammed up.
- That's okay.
- Here. Keep that. It's foryou.
- Thanks.
This is Fitzgerald's lunch.
She's been waiting a long time for it.
I'll deliver it to her.
You got to come to some terms with this
woman. This thing is only gettin' worse.
What dowe need an efficiency expert
here for?
When the old man was here,
this never could have happened.
Thoughtyou were gonna take her out
for a drink, clearthe air.
I did. I took hertwo weeks ago
to Rocky's Bar.
You and Fitzgerald at Rocky's Bar?
## [Piano ]
## [Piano ]
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem. It's just
an hour and 15 minutes.
- My meeting ran long.
- I-- I understand.
We're revamping the offices, getting rid
ofthat antiquated filing system.
Yes? I can find anything I need.
I can locate it like that. I got a feel
forwhere all the stuffis in my office.
We're making a central data file on the
second floor. You'll get used to it.
What's the matter?
You look flushed.
No, I'm just--
I'm just a little warm. That's all.
You have all your
business meetings here?
It's near the office. The coat check
girl's pretty. Don'tyou like it?
No, it's fine. Gives new meaning
to the word "dive, " but it's convenient.
I- I thoughtyou'd appreciate
the thick smoke. You don't
have to put on as much makeup.
- [Man] What's the ladyhavin'?
- Tequila.
Hmm. Tsk.
So, um--
Betty-- Betty Ann--
Um, c-can-- s-should I call you--
I can call you Miss Fitzgerald,
which is fine with me.
I have no problem with that.
I-- I--
Tell me aboutyourself.
- Myself?
- Your hopes, your dreams, you know.
You married?
I mean, obviouslyyou're not married,
'cause then it would not be Miss
Fitzgerald, soyou have a boyfriend?
Is this whyyou got me here?
I just, um-- So--
What is your life like?
I mean, doyou have any hobbies?
- I have a meeting in 15 minutes, so--
- I-I-I-I--
Not-- I didn't mean to ask
aboutyour marital status.
That's none of my business. Maybe
you're-- It's a touchy point with you.
You're possibly divorced orwidowed.
Maybeyour husband committed suicide.
I could understand that.
Mr. Magruder hired me to streamline
the office, and I'm going to.
But ifsomething is not broken, you know
what I say? I say, whyfix it?
There's a reason North Coast has slipped
from the top five insurance companies.
There's an enormous amount
ofwaste and duplication.
Yeah, not-- not in my department.
There's not a single department
that couldn't be run more
efficiently or economically.
I'm not even sure North Coast
wouldn't be better off not carrying...
an investigative division and just
farming out each case privately.
[ Stammers ]
Would it be possible to meet at some
point and have a drinkand discuss that?
- We are having a drink.
- [ Exhales ]
Look, I don't thinkyou know
whatyou're talking about.
I thinkyou came in here
like a steamroller--
You felt threatened by me
from the first day I got on this job.
Not onlywas I an efficiency
expert and a challenge toyour
little statewithin a state,
but I'm not one ofthosewindup dolls
you can tickle at thewater cooler.
I'm smarterthan you. I'm faster.
I can see right through you.
You're right to feel threatened by me.
I... am threatened byyou?
It's fascinating, as a female
executive, how many men I meet
with a fragile masculinity.
A fragile masculinity?
You make one more crackabout
my religion, and woman or nowoman--
- I have to go.
- Hey, listen, honey,
let me level with you here.
Despite all your highfalutin talk
about streamlining the office,
whatyou really need is
a good old-fashioned roll in the hay.
Ha! You wouldn't know
which end is up.
Well, in your case,
itwould be hard to tell.
Don't bother seeing me to the door.
Someone might thinkwe're together.
- Why? Do I look like an organ grinder?
- No, just an organ.
- So the drink didn't smooth things out.
- No, not exactly.
You better get used to her,
'cause she's here to stay.
There's something about that broad that
I don't trust. She's got an evil streak.
We got a reservation for 8:00
at the Rainbow Room for George's 50th.
That'll be fun.
We'llsplit a cab uptown.
C. W., I'm not going to have time to go
home to change, so does this look okay?
Sweetheart, no matter how bad
the economy gets, you will never starve.
Good.
Oh, wait. Come here.
Miss Fitzgerald? Okay, take a card.
You gotta see this, Fitz.
All right, that's a six ofhearts.
- That's amazing. How'd you do that?
- It's magic.
- He could do it all afternoon.
- I wantyou to teach me.
Mr. Magruder, I'll have that report
foryou first thing in the morning.
Fine. Areyou coming to celebrate
George Bond's birthdaywith us tonight?
Not really.
I'm up to my neck in work.
Why don'tyou come?
It'll be fun. George is a great guy.
Most ofthe personnel
here seems very nice.
The only one that gives me
the dry heaves is Briggs.
C. W.? He's crackeda lot ofcases.
Ofcourse, I don'tsee how.
Such a drone.
Gets his tips from street contacts
like ex-cons and blind beggars.
There's something about him
I don't trust.
- Any examples?
- Many.
He's smarmywith those office wisecracks
and double-meaning jokes.
I mean, who is he, really?
He's this shallow,
skirt- chasing egomaniac who's
probably more lucky than good.
Sometimes it's betterto be lucky.
I thinkyou're being too rough on him.
It's more that he's just
kind ofa schnookwho's more
insecure than anything else.
He's got nowife, no family.
Well, hewas married.
Short and stormy. Picked a tramp.
- That's a surprise.
- Excuse me, fellas.
Come tonight.
It'll give us a chance to be together,
and I have the perfect excuse at home--
an employee's birthday.
- How much longer is this gonna go on?
- Not longer, Betty Ann.
I'll be free by the end oftheyear,
and then we can be together openly.
You love me, butyou spend
all the important holidays with her.
Life can get so damn complicated
when you think it's simple.
Come tonight.
Sowe can eye each other and steal
touches and play little games in code?
Yes, that's part ofthe romance.
Somedaywe'll be able to look back
and know that at one time in public...
when one ofus brought up the subject of
Paris, it meant at thatvery moment...
thatwewere dying to make love
with one another.
- You're such an adolescent.
- But cute?
[ Chattering, Laughing ]
- Look at this.
- Oh! Oh!
Happy birthday, George.
Here's to George Bond,
insurance man, father.
- Amateur magician.
- Please, no card tricks tonight, huh?
- Happy 50th, George.
- Thankyou.
Everyone, I'd like to make
a toast to C. W. Briggs.
Thanks toyou, thepolice nowhave
thestolen Picasso in theirpossession.
- Attaboy, C. W.
- C. W.!
By the way, where'dyou come up with
the idea oflooking in the telescope?
What I do is I put myself
in the criminal's position.
I try and anticipate what would he
do next, what his next move would be.
- I think like him.
- That's fantastic.
I would hate to have me after me.
- [ Group Laughing]
- [Woman ] Very good, very good.
What areyou thinking, Mr. Magruder?
You look lost in reverie.
Sorry. I was thinking about
a column I read in the paper...
about all these Germans occupying Paris.
- Yeah, it doesn't look good.
- C. W., you everbeen to Paris?
[ C. W. ]
I've neverbeen out ofthe country.
Zero- dash-six, eight-dash-five,
eight, five, seven.
That's right. That's exactly correct.
And now for something I call
the power oftheJade Scorpion.
- For this I'll need a few victims--
- [Laughing]
I mean, volunteers from the audience
and help from a few nice people.
- Oh, yes.
- Go on.
- Sir?
- We got another one. C. W.!
- Go ahead.
- We got another one forya.
There's a sucker born every minute.
- Represent us well, Briggs.
- [Magician] Manyyears ago...
an emperor in China received as a gift
this precious pendant--
a Jade Scorpion.
It was said to possess
extraordinary powers--
the power to darken men's minds.
I can't get hypnotized.
I'm not a good subject.
[Magician ]
Eyes only on the scorpion, please.
Ears open only
to the sound ofmy voice.
Ears open only
to the sound ofmy voice.
Please, sir.
Sir, look at the scorpion.
The surrender of the m i nd--
The surrender
of the mind--
They resist and resist,
but the scorpion likes resistance.
[Magician ]
What isyourname, sir?
C. W. Briggs.
What doyou do, Mr. Briggs?
I'm an insurance investigator...
for North Coast Casualty
and Fidelity of New York.
- What is your name, miss?
- Betty Ann Fitzgerald.
I also work at North Coast.
- Soyou work together?
- I can't stand her.
- [Laughing]
- Oh, come now.
Don't pay attention to him.
He's a sleazy little megalomaniac
who's frightened ofwomen.
- Enough. Sleep.
- [Laughing C. ontinues]
Silence.
You are now at the
first level oftrance,
but theJade Scorpion wants you
to go to the deepest level.
When I say the word Constantinople,
you will instantly drop into
the deepest hypnotic trance.
All resistance will disappear.
When I saytheword Madagascar,
you will go immediatelyto
the deepest level ofhypnotic sleep,
and you will obey all my orders.
Ready now.
Constantinople. Madagascar.
C. W. Briggs and
Miss Betty Ann Fitzgerald,
I now pronounceyou man and wife.
When Isnap myfingers, you willawaken.
You will not knowyou were in a trance.
You will be madly in love
with each other.
You're on your honeymoon
on a deserted desert island.
Maestro.
The moon shines down
its magical glow...
onyou two honeymooners.
You're deeply, deeply in love.
Are you ready?
One, two, three.
Awaken to your tropical paradise.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking that...
I'm the luckiest man in the world...
to haveyou.
I'm the luckyone, C. W.
I was in love with you from
the first moment that I sawyou.
Make love to me here under the stars...
- to the sound ofthe ocean.
- Miss Fitzgerald.
Aren'tyou making a mistake?
I'm no longer Miss Fitzgerald.
- I'm Mrs. C. W. Briggs.
- Oh! Betty Ann!
- Make love to me here... now.
- Betty Ann.
Stop. Enough.
Unfortunately, every dream
must turn to reality.
When I snap my fingers, you will awaken
and have no memory at all of this event.
You will return to your regular lives
as they exist...
with whatever destinies awaityou, and
let us all hope they are pleasant ones.
Areyou readyto awaken?
On the snap ofmyfingers.
One: You're
beginning to come up.
Two: The memory
is fading completely.
Three: TheJade Scorpion
has created the miracle oflove.
- And four: Awaken.
- [Applause]
- How doyou feel?
- Still waiting for something to happen.
- [Laughing]
- How doyou feel, miss?
- I'm afraid I'm not a very good subject.
- No, me neither.
- I told you this would not work.
- Well, I tried my best.
Come on, George. Back me up.
Briggsie, I'm tellin' ya.
You gazed deeply into her eyes
and told heryou loved her.
You're crazy.
I wouldnever dosuch a thing.
This is a conspiracy
to make me appear crazy.
I hope somebody talks to me
like that someday.
I can't bear Fitzgerald.
Speaking ofthat, isn't it-- Should we
be getting home to, uh, feed your cat?
Thatwould be fun,
but I'm getting a cold,
so I justwant to get to bed
with some tea, you know?
Ifyou've got a cold, somebody's
got to rubyour chest down with Vicks.
- This is what I'm for.
- Anybody rubs my chest down
better bring a ring.
Good foryou.
- Good night, baby.
- Good night, Chris.
I knew we'd get a little time
alone tonight ifyou came along.
I'm glad I came.
[ Sighs ]
[ Exhales ]
[ Ringing ]
[ Sighs ]
Hello?
Constantinople.
You are in a deep trance.
You will fall deeper and deeper
underthe sway ofmywords.
You will obey
my instructions carefully.
You will proceed to
the Kensington estate...
whereyou will obtain thejewels-- all
thejewels-- from the Kensington safe.
You will do this
with the utmost secrecy,
using all the information
and techniques atyour command.
You'll do itwith
great ease and facility.
Then you will return toyour apartment,
taking thejewels with you.
You'll hide them in
a safe and secure hiding place,
awaiting further instructions from me.
You will then fall into a deep slumber
from which you will awake refreshed,
and you'll have no memory
ofanything that has occurred.
You will wait to hearfrom me again.
Your lifewill be simply as
your life is until you hearfrom me.
Remember. You will obey
my instructions to the letter.
You will remember absolutely nothing
that occurred undertrance.
Is that cleartoyou?
Very clear.
Go. TheJade Scorpion commands it.
Awfully late, Mr. Briggs.
Hot on a case, eh?
The Kensingtonsafe
was broken into last night.
Somebody got on the estate.
Jewels worth millions, all gone.
The cops don't have a clue,
and Magruder is numb.
I don't understand.
I made that place burglarproofmyself.
Well, tell that to the perpetrator.
We are on the hook for big money here,
soyou better get over there darn fast.
By now those stones could be
on the market in Tangier or-- or Cairo.
Everything, everything--
My emerald tiara and my sapphire
necklace from India--
That sapphire is the most
perfect in theworld.
No fingerprints,
butwe got a partial shoe print.
- Man orwoman?
- I really can't be sure.
I want to interview everybody
that works here-- the whole staff--
the butlers, the gardeners, everybody.
- Something's goin' on.
- This time I thinkyour gut
reaction is betraying you.
Nobody in this house is involved.
I'd bet my life.
I want to search the up--
I want to go up-- Can I go upstairs?
Ifyou must,
butwould you make it fast?
We've had enough excitement
for one day.
Mrs. Kensington, you know
Alfie and I would never--
Lotte, of course not.
What areyou doin'
in my mother's closet?
Well, hello.
You're one ofthose grubby little
private detectives, aren'tyou?
A private eye, they're called,
a shamus, a gumshoe.
Oh, I'm-- I'm a grubby little
insurance investigator.
The private eyes are romantic.
I- I-I'm just grubby.
Sowhat? You always getyour kicks
fondling women's shoes?
Once in a while I'll fondle
thewholewoman, you know--
Hmph. You have a fresh mouth.
I'm not sure I likeyou.
Well, I tend to grow on people.
We could meet later, and I could
grow on you, ifyou like.
You don't seem tough enough
to go after criminals.
Really? Maybe ifI slapped you around
a little bit, you'd changeyour mind.
- I could slapyou back.
- It's starting to sound like fun.
Should we put some music on?
- Why areyou snooping around?
- You're Laura Kensington, right?
Yeah, that's right, and I have a
strawberry mark on mythigh to prove it.
- Would you like to see it?
- Maybe laterwhen
I can take the full tour.
Huh. My fiance
might not appreciate that.
- Yes? Which one?
- Oh, so you follow my life.
Well, I read the tabloids,
ifthat's whatyou mean.
So you've seen photos of me
diving into public fountains.
And getting arrested for speeding
and throwing champagne at El Morocco.
And while I'm out living the
fast life, you're hard atwork
snooping in people's closets.
Can I help it ifthey
pay me bythe clue?
- Did the burglar leave any?
- He didn't leave any
because he's still among us.
- Says who?
- Says the little man
that lives inside me.
Soyou're C. W. Briggs.
I hearyou're a very sharp investigator
with an impressive record.
I looked forward to meeting you.
- TheysayI always get myman.
- Me too.
[ Exhales ]
Right.
I'm glad we could
have this little chat.
- Too bad there's a houseful of people.
- Whereshall we go tonight?
Hmm? Chinatown or Harlem?
You preferjazz or opium?
Ipreferthe rug
in front ofmyfireplace.
Oh, directly to your apartment, eh?
You always begin with the dessert?
Well, depends what I'm eating.
This will be a very interesting
experiment for me.
I usually prefer more attractive,
athletic, muscular men.
Maybe I could get in a few
push- ups beforeyou came over.
I-- [ Clears Throat]
What aboutyour fiance?
Ifyou don't invite him, I won't.
- Any leads?
- It's an inside job.
No question about it.
- That's not what the cops say.
- They're wrong. It's inside. I can tell.
- Are the Giants playing this afternoon?
- Yeah.
They're playing
the Cardinals in St. Louis.
Call my bookmaker Frankie. I want to get
a bet down. Hundred bucks on the Giants.
- On the Giants towin.
- Towin, naturally!
What doyou think, to place?
Mr. Magruder? Oh, tilt.
- Anything on the Kensington situation?
- It's an insidejob.
- I bet my life on it.
- You betyour life on the Giants,
too, and they're in sixth place.
Can we talkwithout
thewarden being here?
Please, Miss Fitzgerald
is a part ofthis company now.
We must all learn to
worktogether in harmony.
What makes you so positive
it's an insidejob?
It couldn't be that smooth
unless itwas inside.
Miss Fitzgerald is suggesting,
given the magnitude ofthe loss,
thatwe expand our investigation.
- Meaning what?
- I appreciate thevalue
ofintuition to a point.
Butwe're moving into a decade
ofscientific innovation.
Miss Fitzgerald has suggested
that perhaps we might
getyou a little help...
byfarming out part ofthework
to an outside private detective agency.
- What?
- To helpyou-- test the waters--
see ifa newapproach
andfresh techniques make a difference.
Don't feel threatened immediately.
According to you, I'm only threatened
bywomen with high I. Qs.
Did you hire a female detective?
North Coast has got to get
with the progress ofthe marketplace.
There's a lot ofmoney at stake here.
The more time passes, the colder
the trail grows. You know that.
So ifthe Coopersmith Private Detective
Agency makes a contribution, then fine.
If not, we're only out a few bucks.
The Coopersmiths?
Those guys are like Fric and Frac.
- They're sub-mental.
- We are moving into
a new decade, the 1940s.
That means things are different.
Do me a favor. Max Baer's
looking for sparring partners.
Why don'tyou go down to the gym?
You're the only person I've received
this kind ofbitter resistance from.
You're a dinosaurwith your streetways
and disorganized hunt-and-peck methods.
Please. Myfather
always stressed harmony.
I gotta go.
I'm working on a case.
 
 
Watch out for the traffic.
Don't get hit by a bus,
your body mangled beyond recognition.
I ain't heard a word about anyjob.
Nobodytried to fence anything
or do any braggin'.
Charlie, you gotta help mewith this.
Keepyour ears open.
Anything you hear, I gotta know.
It's very important, okay?
Fifty? You must be desperate.
You know where to reach me. Keep eating
the carrots. I think they're workin'.
I thinkJoe said they're
all gone up there, Mr. Briggs.
I'm just gonna check something out.
I'll be down in five minutes.
[Door Opens]
You startled me.
I was working late.
Oh, 'cause Eddie said he didn't
thinkanybodywas up here.
Well, I'm here. [ Chuckles ]
Obviously I'm here.
- What areyou so nervous--
- I'm not nervous.
Whywould I be nervous? Working up here
alone, I didn't expect to seeyou.
Don'tyou work late all the time?
That's what theytell me.
What is this, 20 questions?
You scared me.
I'm working up here alone.
I'm filling out some reports.
What areyou gonna do, ask Magruder
to take out all thewater coolers?
Why don'tyou makeyourwisecracks
somewhere else? I'm busy.
I'm outta here.
You know, I-I-- Don't work too late,
'cause the bags under
your eyes are getting bigger.
Have a goodevening, and
ifyou findyou're going to have
a sudden coronary thrombosis,
you should probably drive
directly to the hospital.
[ Magruder ] You were right.
We shouldn't fool around at the office.
- He gives me the willies.
- He's a harmless sort.
[KeysJingling]
- Hey. How'dyouget in?
- It wasn't very hard.
Really? What'd you do, have
your father buy the building?
A small tip to the super
was all it took.
Foryou maybe. I give the super
a small tip, he spits on my shoes.
I brought somevery expensive
Russian vodka, 120 proof.
Don't drop that, you know.
You're liable to blow up the building.
I got bored waiting. There's
nothing to read but detective
magazines and the racing form.
I got a deck ofplaying cards with naked
women on them. You could've, you know--
Let me guess.
You use it to play solitaire.
I used to date the six ofspades.
I lovewhereyou live.
It's justwhat I thought itwould be--
a grimy little rathole.
Oh, thankyou.
I'll tell my decoratoryou said that.
It's the effectwewere going for.
You dying tosee my,
uh, strawberrymark?
Ifit's in the same spot it was this
afternoon, I'd like to check it out.
This is truly a novelty for me.
I'm used topenthouses andyachts--
gorgeous European lovers who buyme
presents andsweep me offmy feet.
And yet, somehow, I find it strangely
exciting standing here...
in a grungy hovel
with a myopic insurance clerk.
I know there's a compliment in there.
I just don't knowwhere it is.
You gonna take that coat off?
It hasn't rained in
this apartment in 20 years.
Oh, well.
[ Clears Throat]
What doyou think?
IfI happen to pass away
whilewe're doing anything,
just have the embalmer
leave the smile on myface.
- [Phone Ringing]
- Perfect timing.
I'll slip into something a little more
comfortable, wait foryou in bed.
More comfortable than that? What are
you going to put on, Jergens lotion?
- Hello?
- [ Magician ] Constantinople.
You are in the power
oftheJade Scorpion.
You will proceed to
the Dillworth mansion.
You will enter and open the safe.
Haveyou ever heard ofan Indian book
called the Kama Sutra?
I'm sorry, Laura, butwe're going to
have to postpone our little rendezvous.
- Pardon me?
- I just recalled a previous engagement.
I hopeyou don't mind.
The doorman will getyou a taxi.
- I had a wonderful evening.
Thankyou very much.
- You are jokin', of course.
I'll turn around and you can get
dressed, and please try and hurry.
- I'm rather pressed for time.
- Haveyou got a loose screw?
Tonight was very meaningful to me.
Really.
I'll always think ofit
in a very cherished way.
Ifyou're in the neighborhood again,
drop in.
What's come overyou?
Should you want any peanuts
to snack on on theway home,
I think I have a whole dish
ofthem in the other room.
You hatewomen, don'tyou?
Not at all. Actually,
they're a splendid gender.
Really. A very pleasant variation.
I should have known.
I should have known.
A mousy little clerk likeyou,
just chasing your entire life
after criminals.
- I should have known.
- No, Laura, don't be cross.
Do drop in again in the springtime.
The oleanderwill be in bloom.
I'm going! I'm getting out!
I'm not used to getting kicked out ofa
man's bed, but it could have been worse.
You'revery sick, you know?
Thanking you in advance
for understanding, Laura.
God bless you.
You have a splendidly shaped buttocks.
- Mamma mia.
- God bless you, Laura.
I can't believe it.
It's identical.
You think somebodyfrom the
Kensington household came over
and pulled this one too?
We did the security here.
We made the place foolproof.
Somebody's a step ahead ofya.
I want to speak to the Dillworths.
I want to question them.
The Coopersmith detectives
have been grilling them all morning.
Geez. You mean--
I can't believe it.
She convinced Magruder
to put the Coopersmiths on.
We need all the help
we can get on this case.
What's happenin', fellas?
You want to talk to me?
Hey, C. W.
We're in on this one now.
Yeah? Well, this is my case,
just soyou're clear on that.
Will you listen to him?
Like we horned in.
- Hey, they called us.
- That was their first mistake.
Maybe theythinkyou're slippin'.
- You know my brotherJoe?
- The one that died at birth?
I hearyou're havin'
a little trouble.
- Soyou guys get any clues?
- A few.
Yeah? What?
Wanna share them with me?
I'll letyou know ifthey're real clues
or ifyou found your own laundry list.
We'd like to make this collar. It'd mean
a long-term deal with North Coast.
I hearthey're makin'
some changes up there.
Fellas, I'm gonna
make this bust,
then you guys are gonna be back atyour
old jobs tracking down lost poodles.
We had to laugh when we heard
you thought the Kensington heist
was an insidejob.
I can see alreadywe're gonna
be trippin' all over each other.
- One ofus is gonna fall down.
- We don't plan on fallin'.
You're in overyour heads--
all four of'em.
This is a very smart burglar.
You guys have trouble figuring out
who did itwhen you get a confession.
I'll tell you whatwe figure.
We're looking for a tall man,
heavyset, athletic, about 30 years old.
Belly button in or out?
Belly button in or out?
[C. oopersmith] Now, ifhe's short
at that weight, he's fat--
too fat to squeeze
through the kitchen window.
Wanna show him the big clue?
What's the big clue? The guy
leave behind his birth certificate?
Show him.
No one in this house
was ever to Rocky's Bar.
Hey-- I've been to Rocky's Bar.
You got a matchbook. Big deal.
Six million people eat at Rocky's Bar.
We're gonna nail this guy.
The important thing is thatyou
don't thinkofus as competition.
Don'tworry. I don't.
What areyou so upset about?
We'll get the guy.
Can you believe she talked Magruder
into hiring these twojerks?
You've been moping around all day.
It's not likeyou.
What's goin' on?
- Al, I got a confession to make.
- What?
I woke up this morning. I found
this on the floorin myapartment.
- Yeah, so?
- I have no memory ofbeing
with anybody last night.
Come on. How many times has that
happened to everybody?
You pick up a broad. You knock off
a bottle ofbooze. You're in the sack.
- Soyou didn't remember.
- There was also an empty bottle
ofvodka on the floor.
- I don't drinkvodka.
- All the more reason you blacked out.
Vodka does funnythings to a person.
Believe me.
I've gotten upwith some pretty
strange- looking heads under my arm.
I can't figure it out. There's
something wrong. I came back here.
[C. W'. s Voice] I wanted
to checksomething in myoffice.
That I remember clearly.
This was about 9:00.
Hey, wait a minute. I ran into--
Wait a minute.
- What are you thinkin'?
- Of course.
No wonder I thought
it was an inside job.
But not inside with the Dillworths
or the Kensingtons.
- It's inside our company.
- What?
It's so obvious.
Why didn't I see it right away?
Areyou kiddin'? Who?
Mize, Bond and me.
We're the only ones who have
access toyour security setups.
Yeah, and what ifsomebody
elsewas given access?
What ifsomeone
we don't know as well...
becauseshe hasn't workedhere
as long as we've been here?
- Fitzgerald?
- Whynot?
Why not? My God.
We've had female jewel thieves before.
She's always saying she can
do anything a man can do.
I don't think she meant stealing.
What dowe know about her?
Nothing.
You know, she has expensive tastes.
Shewears good jewelry.
- I gotta get into her office.
- Don't.
- I must--
- Ifyou get caught, she'll kill you.
She'll take a gun and shootyou.
She goes duck hunting.
But it makes all the sense in theworld.
She's here late every night.
She has the files--
We've given herthe files.
She knows all the security information.
I gotta go through her place.
Don't rifle her desk.
You're gonna get caught.
- Uh--
- What areyou doing?
- Me? No, I was--
- You're going through my desk.
[ Stammering ]
I beg your complete pardon.
You're all red.
You were snooping through my papers.
You know, only a suspicious, paranoid
mind would say something like that.
I doubtvery much whether
Amish people...
or Quakers would come
to that conclusion.
You wormy little ferret.
Nowyou're mixing metaphors,
soyou're upset.
- I know whyyou're
snooping through my office.
- I wasn't snooping.
You're looking for the report
bythe Coopersmith Agency.
- You hired them to give me a hard time.
- What?
That's right. Now it's too many cooks,
and we're getting all over each other.
These guys have made more progress in
a few hours than you have in two days.
Wereyou crying? Your mascara--
Don't try to tap-danceyourway
out of getting caught searching my desk.
I wasn't searching. I was rummag--
Can a colleague not rummage?
Get out. IfI ever catch you
going through my stuffagain--
- What areyou afraid I'll find?
- You couldn't find your nose
ifI turned the lights out.
Watch out, 'cause I'm ontoyou. I know
whatyou are. I know whatyou're about.
This is silly.
We should both calm down.
I just had lunch, and you're
liable to overtaxyour heart
and have a massive stroke,
killing you instantly or
paralyzing halfyour body.
Have a nice day.
- I gotta get into her apartment.
- You're askin' fortrouble.
- She hit the ceiling
when she caught me before.
- Can you blame her?
'Cause she's guilty.
Look behind her eyes. She's a bad broad.
- She's got pretty eyes.
- I said look behind, behind the eyes.
There's something wrong--
The minute I met this broad,
I sensed there was trouble.
She says the same thing aboutyou.
Ifyou twowere prizefighters,
we could get a million-dollar gate.
- I gotta get into her place.
- Look, let me tell you something.
Being an investigator
doesn't putyou above the law.
She catches you,
she's gonna haveyou locked up.
Has that ever stopped me before?
- She's going out tonight.
- How doyou know?
'Cause I went through her desk.
I know her appointments.
She's meeting her sistertonight
for dinner at a restaurant.
I thought she said her sister
was an invalid in Detroit.
That's what I'm tellin' ya.
Nothing she says ever checks out.
Yeah, well, you know, you can't break
into her apartment. It's unethical.
I'm not gonna break in.
I got the key.
- How did you manage that?
- I stole it from her purse.
She's gonna know something's up
when it's missing, right?
She'll never know. I made a duplicate.
I put the original back.
My God. You know, you've got
a touch oflarceny in you.
You would have made
one heck ofa thief.
It takes one to catch one.
Don't forget that.
- I'll seeyou tomorrow.
- Yeah, seeya around.
[Door Opens]
[Door C. loses]
- C. an I takeyour coat, honey?
- I'll get it.
Okay, what did you want
to tell me?
No drink?
We've had enough drinks.
How much alcohol doyou need
to be completely honest?
- You're not making this very easy.
- Why should I make it easy?
Becausewe care about each other.
Before itwas you loved me.
Now it's thatyou care for me?
- Just sit down.
- I'm not gonna faint.
I've been dumped before.
I wish you wouldn't
say things like that.
You rushed me out of
that restaurant to talk...
becauseyou were afraid I was
going to make a scene or pass out.
You are a highlyvolatilewoman.
Am I? Most men complain
I'm cool as ice.
- You know I care aboutyou.
- You said that. Get to the point.
- It's not that I don't want
to leave Caroline--
- But in the end, you're not.
I've tried to work up
the courage a hundred times.
All those promises? Those stories
about how miserableyou were at home?
- You're making this into a nightmare.
- Isn't it? It is forme.
- Try to understand.
We can still be friends.
- Oh!
- We can even continue to sleep together.
- Are you nuts?
I only got i nvolved in this
because you told me your
marriage was on its last legs.
When you say it like that,
it sounds like I've deceived you.
- Haven'tyou?
- I didn't mean to.
I respectyou too much.
Oh, my God. How did we go from love
toyou care for me toyou respect me?
Next thing you'll be
buying me a prayer shawl.
- Betty Ann--
- Leave me alone, okay? Please.
- Betty--
- Just go-- I'll be fine. Leave me alone.
- Honey, listen--
- Leave me alone!
I hope you decide
to stay on at North Coast.
You're really helping
to turn our company around.
I guess we won't be having
that honeymoon in Positano, huh?
I feel like such a jerk!
You shouldn't. It's my fault. I got
into this against my betterjudgment.
- Honey--
- Just go.
[Door Opens, C. loses ]
[Exhales ]
Good- bye, C. hris.
Good- bye, New York.
Miss Fitzgerald!
God! What are you doing?
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean, what am I doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- I happened to be passing through.
- You what?
- I'm-- What do you-- I was-- I'm--
- I'm hiding behind your screen.
- Behind what?
You have this niceJapanese screen.
I was hiding behind it.
How did you get in?
How long haveyou been here?
I-- What time-- I've been here
quite a while, actually.
- You broke into my apartment?
- I didn't break in.
- How did you get in?
- You reallywant to know?
- How did you get in here?
- I made a duplicate ofyour key.
- You what?
- Which you can have for no extra charge.
It's good to have two keys, 'cause
an emergency happens once in a while.
- Why did you do this to me?
- What? Why?
Because I'm convinced
somebody up at North Coast...
is responsible forthejewel robbery.
- Who, me?
- Well, you're a prime suspect, yes.
- Based on what?
- Based on the fact that I know
everybody else better than you.
- You have access to all the data.
- So? So doyou.
But you were so nervous the other night
when I caughtyou up there.
I came up, and you were
acting so strange.
You have a Rocky's matchbook.
I sawyou put it in your--
Rememberwe had a drink at Rocky's Bar?
It didn't go toowell.
Soyou broke into my apartment illegally
and spied on me?
I wasn'tspying. What's wrong withyou?
I was rummaging.
- I'm a big rummager.
- You what?
I was rummaging in the afternoon.
I saw "dinnerwith my sister. "
All those sisters-- all those dinners--
Those were with Magruder, right?
Oh, God! I'm mortified!
Stop it. Ifitwasn't for me being here,
they'd be scraping you upwith a spoon.
That's none ofyourbusiness,
youslimylittle weasel.
And over a jerk like Magruder.
He's not a jerk. He's wonderful.
He's twice the man you are, you roach.
Don't you see? He gives you these
stories so he can get intoyour pants.
- He's not gonna leave his wife.
- You witnessed my humiliation.
The only humiliating thing
is how this guytakes advantage
ofa smartwoman likeyou.
You're not fit to discuss
Chris Magruder.
Look at this. She still loves the guy.
I can't believe it.
Get out before I call the police
and haveyou arrested
for breaking and entering.
I'm not letting you alone here tonight.
Areyou crazy? Look atyou.
I'd ask ifyou had anyfriends,
but I know the answer.
- [ Groans ]
- Give me this. Jesus. What--
What-- [ Groans ]
Great.
- Areyou okay?
- [ Sniffles ]
- Hello?
- Oh.
[ Sighs ]
Jesus.
- [Liquid Pouring]
- What the hell areyou doing here?
I'm making coffee.
Oh, God!
It's all coming backto me now.
You came here last night because
you thought I stole somejewels!
This happens to be
a very confusing case.
I'll sayyou're confused.
Why didn'tyou go home to sleep?
- Areyou kidding?
And letyou do something crazy?
- Likewhat?
Like take a swan dive out thewindow.
How doyou know I wouldn't take
a swan divewith you here?
- Because I watched overyou.
- You stayed up all nightwatching me?
That's exactly right. Yes.
And you snore like a grizzly bear
with a sinus condition.
I had a bad moment last night.
I'm fine now.
- You talk in your sleep.
- You probablytook notes,
you suspicious little inchworm.
- Who's Rita?
- Rita's the woman
my ex-husband ran awaywith.
- Anything else?
- You certainly know how to pick men.
Checkyour sex.
There's not a lot to pick from.
And you mentioned my name too.
I thoughtyou were awake.
- You said that I should rot in hell.
- I was probably awake.
I figured you were feeling better.
Now, ifyou'll go, I gotta
be atwork in 30 minutes, and
don't gossip aboutwhatyou saw.
Nobody's gonna gossip.
I couldn't care less aboutyour
life. It means nothing to me.
I couldn't stand you when I metyou,
and I can't stand you now.
I find you obnoxious and pompous--
Do me a favor.
When you see me in the office-- do me
a favor-- walk the otherway, okay?
And if Magruder tells you
he's gonna leave his wife,
ifI wereyou,
I would keep my legs crossed.
Don't choke on your breakfast
and die ofasphyxiation.
You'll wind up unable to
dislodge a large piece oftoast,
no matter how hard you cough.
Mr. Magruder, you sent for--
Oh. Ifyou'llall open
yourhymnbooks topage 90--
Sit down, C. W.
We have a situation.
Your brother looks good.
The embalmer did nice work.
I'll let the Coopersmiths
bring you up to date.
After careful search, using some of
the most up-to-minute techniques,
we found some interesting clues.
Yeah? Leading to who,
Eleanor Roosevelt?
We got ashoeprint offthe
parapet at the Kensington place.
So?
An eight-and-a-half
"C" Florsheim cordovan.
Onlyworn by 20 million Americans.
I mean, I wear an eight-and-a-half"C"
cordovan Florsheim shoe.
For the money, you cannot
get a better shoe.
We also found a couple ofhairs.
One on the rug at the Kensington
place, the other one actually
inside the Dillworth safe.
They match.
Forgive me ifI'm not knocked out.
Oh, we don't mean just to each other.
They match yours.
Just like the eight-and-a-half
"C. "cordovans.
Hey, fellas. I know you guys
are angling for myjob--
We also got a fingerprint
off the matchbook.
You got a fingerprint
off a matchbook?
The Coopersmith lab uses
highly sensitive apparatus.
- You're not gonna tell me it's mine?
- It is, C. W.
Well, so what?
So I leave a footprint on the parapet,
or I inadvertently drop a matchbook.
The matchbookwas found before
you got over to the place.
You guys don't doubt my honesty,
doyou?
Let me tell you, I was
a Boy Scout for threeyears.
I got a number of merit badges
home, and my clergyman,
who happens right now to be wanted
for pederasty, will vouch for me.
Nobody's making any accusations.
You do have some outstanding debt
from expensive sports betting--
baseball, the ponies.
Areyou guys investigating me?
C. W., I assureyou, this is only
an inquiry in-house at this time.
We don'twant the police
to know about it, and we're
not looking for bad publicity.
Miss Fitzgerald, what doyou think?
Say something.
You're a brightwoman.
You think I did it?
Please, C. W., let's not have
our dailybloodbath between
you and Miss Fitzgerald.
- She's not an investigator.
- But she's a very bright woman.
She's got a lot ofideas.
She was the one who brought these
two mouth breathers in on this case.
It's nothin' personal.
We're just building a case.
We all want to catch a jewel thief.
I'm on your side.
Fellas, I think
we gotta get team jackets.
I want a resume of every employeewho
works here messengered to my apartment.
Don'tworry, C. W.
We'll get to the bottom ofthis.
Oh, Miss Fitzgerald,
I wanted to meetwith you later.
- Aboutwhat, Mr. Magruder?
- Our Paris account.
As I recall,
that account is closed.
I have to seeyou later.
Just to talk.
I behaved like such a fool.
Later, f-for a drink. Just for a drink.
[Doorbell Ringing]
Oh. Well.
Can I come in?
Yeah, sure. I-I'm shocked.
I-- The place is a little messy.
IfI knewyou were coming, I would have
had the maid rearrange the dirt.
Areyou alone?
Alone? Yeah. Of course.
I would have called, but I decided
itwas saferto talk toyou in person.
- What doyou mean, "safer"?
- I can't stay long.
Why? You gonna meet
Magruder in Paris?
That's none ofyour business.
Thanks for coming to my defense today in
the office. Itwas really nice ofyou.
That's what I wanted
to talk toyou about.
The C. oopersmith brothers had Laura
Kensington in for questioning today.
She told them she was with you
the night before last...
and that you got a phone call
in the middle of the night
and began acting strangely...
and got rid ofher becauseyou
had to go someplace at midnight?
Well, let me tell you, she's lying.
- Whywould she lie?
- Wh-- Useyour head.
Would I kick Laura Kensington
out ofmy bed at midnight?
Even ifthe president needed me.
- Whyareyoulying tome?
- Why did you come here
with this crazy story?
Because Ishouldhavespoken up
at that meeting today.
Because while I thinkyou're
a mealy-mouthed little...
- Reptile.
- reptile-- thankyou--
I don't thinkyou're a jewel thief.
- What makes you so positive?
- It's too daring foryou.
You're not romantic enough.
It requires flairandimagination.
Myinstinct's telling me
you're not the one.
- I didn't thinkyou had instincts.
- I have them.
I don't usually trust them, especially
when it comes to sizing up men,
but this time I can feel it.
You're good atweasellytype things,
like snooping and spying.
You're not man enough
to be a cat burglar.
- You sound likeyou're attracted
to men who break the law.
- We're not here to discuss me.
We're here to talk aboutwhat Laura
Kensington told the Coopersmiths.
Laura Kensington wasn't here.
She-- You're making--
Laura Kensington was not here.
She said she left her stocking here.
Hey, that couldbe anybody's.
I don't know--
A lot ofwomen pass
through this apartment.
I'm not saying they're all winners,
but there's a lot ofaction here.
I 'm sure you're not overly particular.
Look. What do you want from me?
[Stammering]
I happen to enjoy the proximity
of a well-proportioned member
ofthe opposite sex.
That's how God created us,
and why should I be the one
to quibble with His concept?
I came to tell you a case is building
againstyou. Be honestwith me!
- I'm honest. I'm honest.
- Where did you get this stocking?
It's some broad's.
The women that are here, they lose
an earring, a stocking, I don't know.
Laura Kensington says it's hers.
She also says she tipped the super.
He let her in here,
and that story checks out.
- Whoever that is, I'm not here.
- What? Wh--
- Who is it?
- It's Herb andJoe C. oopersmith.
I don't want to be seen here!
Why? What's the problem?
What am I, a leper?
You're under suspicion.
I would have a lot of explaining to do.
You know, I thinkyou're still hooked
on Magruder.
That's whyyou don't--
Go down the end ofthe hall.
There's a bedroom.
Shut the door. Go in the bedroom.
Can I sit down in there,
orwill I catch something?
Germs can't live in your bloodstream.
It's too cold.
[Herb]
Let's go, C. W. Open up.
Coming!
Hey, fellas.
You sureyou got the right apartment?
The traps with the cheese
are in the basement.
- Can we come in?
- Now, wait a minute.
I got a chorus girl in the back room,
and ifI don't hurry up--
Wouldn't be Laura Kensington,
would it?
Laura Kensington?
I don't know.
They all look the same upside down.
I can nevertell.
She says shewas here
the other night,
till you dumped herto go out on
mysterious middle-of-the-night business.
Hey, would I dump Laura Kensington?
I eatWheaties.
Problem is, Eddie, the night guard from
the North Coast building, says you, uh,
made some strange middle-of-the-night
visits toyour office...
both nights the robberies took place.
Fellas, I'd love to chat
with you, but, you know,
there's a nurse in
the other room there, and--
I thoughtyou said
shewas a chorus girl.
Who does a little nursing?
Give me a break.
Come on. We can discuss this
tomorrow, can't we?
I don't know howyou can still make love
with this on your mind.
You know, you're facing
a long jail sentence.
That's exactlywhy I gotta
get in all I can now.
Yeah? Well, we're gonna turn this over
to the police tomorrow.
You can see. There's a case developing
that's pretty incriminating.
This is circumstantial evidence.
That's all you got.
Many a man's gone to the gallows
on circumstantial evidence.
Well, fellas, the gallows
are gonna have towait,
because I got a cocktail waitress
in the other room now, and I--
- Cocktail waitress?
- Yeah, a nurse, you know,
who-- who's a little bit
of a chorus girl,
and she works a lounge now and then.
Ifyou catch thejewel thief,
let me know.
- I'll getyou both newyo-yos.
- Yeah.
They're--
- What is this?
- I was...
browsing through your bookshelf,
and I found this deck
ofnaked playing cards and these.
This is-- What doyou--
This is-- This is
the Kensington jewels.
This is the-- This is
the Dillworth jewels and the-- the--
This is--
What areyou--
What areyou looking
at me like that for?
Becauseyou found them in amongst
my collection offemale art studies?
What is the implication here?
I used to gowith the six ofspades.
Then the four ofdiamonds
caught us together and therewas a--
I was aware thatyou sneaked up
mysteriouslyto the office
in the middle ofthe night...
and the lobby guard sawyou.
I knowyou have Laura Kensington's
stocking, and she swears...
you kicked her out ofbed to
take care ofsudden business,
which your super corroborates.
They have a footprint,
a matchbookwith your fingerprint,
and still I believed
thatyou didn't do it.
But now the actual stolen property
turns up hidden in your bedroom.
Sowhat areyou saying?
This makes you suspicious ofme?
I was actually a bit touched thatyou
stayed up all nightwatching over me.
I began to think, " Maybe he's not the
scummy littlevermin he seems to be. "
I maybe ascummyvermin,
but I'm an honestscummy vermin.
- I didn't take these jewels.
- How can you deny it?
- You've been caught red-handed.
- Yes, I--
What-- I'm-- I grant you,
there's a fingerprint of me,
and they have a footprint,
and the jewels are in my bedroom.
This I giveyou.
- I'm starting to think
I'm in tremendous trouble here.
- I'm calling the police.
No. Will you forget about logic
and give me the benefit ofthe doubt?
- Ha! That makes me an accessory.
- Not ifI'm innocent.
You don't have a kosher bone
in your body.
That's exactlywhyyou getyourselves
into these problems.
That's why Magruder's
waiting foryou, right?
You make all thewrong decisions
'causeyou make 'em here, not here.
Decisions made here
are not as reliable as here,
because this is gray cells
and this is blood,
and blood circulates
through the body.
It gets around.
It knows what the score is.
But up here, gray cells
just laythere and think.
- You seewhat I'm saying?
- [Phone Rings]
- You seewhat I'm saying?
- [Phone Rings]
- Hello?
- Constantinople.
You will take thejewels,
each and every one ofthem.
You will take thejewels,
each and every one ofthem.
Make sureyou have them all.
Wrap them tightly in brown paper
so it's impossible for anyone
to tell what they are.
Go to Grand Central Station.
Rent a locker. Lock them in.
Go home, taking the keywith you,
and put the key in your mailbox.
Make sure to leave the mailbox open.
Then you will go into a deep,
refreshing slumber, and when you awake,
you will remember nothing
ofwhat has transpired.
Is that clear?
Miss Fitzgerald?
Have-- Have I ever told you...
thatyou're one ofthe most
beautiful women I've ever met?
- I'm turning you in.
- No, I mean it.
That's what made me first fall in love
withyou is those beautiful eyes.
I can't believe it. You're actually
trying to sweet-talk me?
I resisted because, well, down deep...
I thought thatyou might hurt me,
and I didn'twant to put myself
in that position again.
C. W., let me setyou straight
once and for all.
I wouldn't be interested in you
ifyou were the last man on Earth.
Not onlythat, I find it insulting
thatyou could think...
I would fall for such
a heavy-handed ploy.
What a low opinion
ofmeyou must have.
Thankyou for dropping by.
I'm a little busy right now,
but tomorrow night,
maybewe could have dinner.
I know a candlelight restaurant.
I could look intoyour eyes
and tell you how crazy aboutyou I am.
IfI didn't knowwhat a squirming
little trapped ratyou were,
I'd thinkyou had a brain tumor.
- You're late.
- God, I'm still trembling.
Over last night?
I couldn't sleep a wink.
It's not that, Chris. It's Briggs.
He's guilty, isn't he?
It's a sad story.
Please don't make me
go into all the details,
but I wonder ifhe's having some kind
ofmental breakdown.
He may be realizing
the consequences ofhis deeds.
- The Coopersmiths are closing in on him.
- Could he have...
a split personality?
A lot of criminals have been
known to play crafty games
when it suited their purposes.
I need a drink.
IfI tell you something, doyou promise
not to go offhalf-cocked?
Okay, but hurry.
I've got some big news.
- I found thejewels.
- What?
And keep me apprised, will you?
Thankyou.
The police are on theway, thank God.
It's an open-and-shut case.
Much as I cringe at the publicity,
I'm elated at the recovery.
It's clear there's
so much more to this, Chris.
Oh, I've seen men driven to extremes
before being around big money.
These guys earn their living exposing...
all kinds of exotic schemes
to defraud and rob people.
Sometimes they start thinking,
" Hey, I'm on the inside.
I knowwhythese schemes fail.
I won't make the same mistakes. "
You're saying he's cracked
from so manyyears ofhard work?
He's a driven man.
Had a terrible marital experience.
Turned him offwomen, except for
the little no-threat secretaries...
and barflies he picks up.
Crushed when he caught
his wife cheating.
He's feeling older
and looks around and says,
" Hey, maybe it's time
I get mine and get out. "
Guy named Peterson
a couple ofyears ago tried the same.
Of course, he's a houseguest
at Sing Sing these days.
Well, I'm sureyou know him
betterthan I do.
It'll resolve itself.
Um, Betty Ann, I spokewith Caroline.
- You did?
- I told her I wanted myfreedom.
- Really?
- Isn't that fabulous?
It's surprising.
I thoughtyou'd be
knocked offyourfeet.
Well, I mean, itwas last night.
- It's sort oflike a roller coaster.
- Forget about last night.
I knew I'd made a mistake
the minute I leftyour apartment.
What did she say?
I thinkshe sensed
we'd been drifting apart.
Shewas very poised.
Said ifI was sure
that's what I wanted, uh--
- Thankyou.
- I'll have another one ofthese, please.
Sure.
You're certainly not as euphoric
as I'd imagined.
Well, you can't expect me to just
change gears and turn on a dime.
- Haveyou changed your mind?
- Mmm.
- No.
- You haven't met someone else, haveyou?
No, no, I haven't.
I don't understand, fellas.
What-- What's going on? What'd I do?
Yes, those are the ones.
They were in his bookcase.
He bets every day, and, uh,
and he usually loses.
I knew he was into the bookmakers
for a bundle.
Look, I was with him on Tuesday night
till about 12:00.
Then suddenly he got a phone call
and hewas like a different man.
Ifitwas anyone else but C. W.,
wewouldn't even be discussing this.
Thejewels were in his locker.
It's an airtight case.
Listen, fellas,
I knowyouguys wantedmy job,
but I could get 30 years
up the river for this.
With good behavior,
you'll be out in 20.
- [ Laughing ]
- I'll getyou. No matterwhereyou are.
I'll check every low-I. Q club in town,
and I'll find you. I'll kill you.
- Low I. Q Some genius.
- I'll kill these guys.
- Take it easy.
- I'm not one to givepious lectures,
but ifyou needed money,
you could have come to me.
I would have listened.
I warned you aboutyour gambling habit.
Can'tyou see
what a conspiracythis is?
They plant a footprint
and a fingerprint,
and the nightwatchman
forges my signature.
It's easy. And this crazy girl
who smokes opium makes up a story.
And Fitzgerald plants
thejewels in my apartment.
There's a word for peoplewho think
everyone is conspiring against them.
- That's right. Perceptive.
- C. W.,
you triedtoswallowthe keyto
the lockerat Grand C. entral Station...
where we found the stolen goods.
- You got anywitnesses?
- Yeah, me!
You gonna take yourword over mine?
Let's get him over to the courthouse
and book him.
You better get a lawyer, C. W.
I'm shocked.
This is one ofmy best men.
You know how long I've known this guy?
Tommy, come with me.
Yeah, Mike, I'm right behind ya.
I'm sorry about this, C. W.
I'll make the arrangements.
Stick around.
Well, well, well.
Ifit isn't
Mr. Fast-Talkin' Investigator...
who got caught with his hand
in the cookie jar.
Did I reallythrowyou out ofbed?
Why? You planning on using
the insanity defense?
Listen, honey, I gotta get some help,
and you're gonna help me.
- Am I?
- Yes.
- And what makes you think that?
- This is your kind ofthing.
- And what makes you think that?
- This is your kind ofthing.
This'll look great on your resume.
A suspected felon, a daring escape from
police headquarters, broad daylight.
[Stammering]
Youlike this kindofthing.
Go over to that top drawer over there.
They took the handcuffs
outta the second drawer from the left.
- There's gotta be a keyin there.
- Nervous.
See ifthere's a key.
Go. Hurry up. C. ome on.
Don't-- Hur--
Gotta make this fast.
Otherwise, I'm gonna be--
They'll put me away.
I'll be showering with all men
for the rest of my life.
Hey, miss, I'm sorry.
No one's allowed in here.
You wanna comewith me?
Let's go, miss.
You're not allowedin here.
C. ome on. Unlessyou
wanna get locked up too.
- I'm sorry things didn't work out, C. W.
- C. ome on. Let's go.
- Yeah? You wanna lock me up?
- What's wrong with you?
- Just take your hands off me!
- Something wrong with you?
Caroline and I areworking on the
details ofthe separation agreement now.
I'll be out ofthe house in twoweeks.
The divorcewill take longer.
That's whythe agreement
has to be securely in place.
Otherwise, it could get killed
ifwewere found together.
- Where areyou?
- Doyou think he's really guilty?
- Is thatwhatyou're thinking about?
- I can't shake this uneasyfeeling.
What? That he's innocent?
He was caught red-handed.
Believe me,
itjust doesn't feel right.
I don't see that snoopy little termite
as a romanticjewel thief.
Well, I'd hardly call
breaking the law romantic.
- [Phone Ringing]
- I didn't mean it thatway.
What did you mean? The evidence
against him is overwhelming.
- I don't knowwhat I mean anymore.
- [Ringing C. ontinues]
Hello? Yes.
Yes, he is. Hold on.
- It's the Coopersmiths.
- Thankyou.
Hello. No.
Really? Oh-- Oh, how?
Okay. Yes, I certainlywill.
Ifyou had any doubts about his
culpability, this should allaythem.
- He escaped.
- He did?
Slipped out ofthe handcuffs and leaped
across to the building next door.
- C. W. Briggs?
- Like a common burglar.
I'm starting to realize that none ofus
really knew him all theseyears.
I have to go down
to police headquarters.
It looks likeyour little termite
ate his way out.
- Did you forget--
- Resist the temptation to scream.
- What areyou doing here,
you littlejewel thief?
- No, I'm not a thief.
I- I'm suspect.
It's the complete different.
I'm a very promising suspect,
but I didn't do it,
and I gotta have time to prove that.
Otherwise, they're gonna lock me up
in a concrete building...
and you'll only be able
to insult me on visiting days.
- Why did you come here?
- Because I have no one else to turn to.
Everybody knows how much you hate me,
so no one will look for me here.
I gotta have a place to sleep.
I'm exhausted.
You can't sleep here.
I couldn't afford the fumigating bills.
Ifyou wanna call the police,
call the police.
I don't care.
You know, I'm sleeping here.
You wanna call 'em, then call 'em.
Get me the 11 th Precinct.
[ Ringing ]
- Hello?
- Miss Fitzgerald?
- Yes?
- Madagascar.
You are in a deep trance,
and you will obey each and every command
theJade Scorpion gives you.
You will acquire
all the pertinent security data...
forthe Adrian Greenwood mansion.
You willproceedthere,
andafter disabling the securitysystem,
you will remove all the jewels
from the safe,
obtaining each and every one of them.
These jewels you will hide
in your apartment. Is this clear?
Yes.
What's the matter? Can't sleep?
No. I've had the strangest dreams.
That's funny, 'cause I've had some
crazy dreams myselflately.
I dreamed we were finally together.
Really? You and Magruder?
It's a match made in heaven.
By a retarded angel, but in heaven.
You misunderstand me. I dreamed
you and I finallywound up together.
You-- That's funny,
'cause I didn't hear any screaming.
From the first minute I metyou,
a voice inside me said
I finallyfound what I've been
searching for mywhole life.
What's that?
A roach, a vermin, a little inchworm?
A black-- Or did I call you
a blackwidow spider?
I knew that sooner or later, you and I
would wind up in each other's arms.
Hey, haveyou been gargling
with tequila?
- [ Clicks Radio On ]
- You're a very romantic man.
What did you smoke before I woke up?
Suppose I toldyou I had
the mostpassionate crush onyou
I've everfelt foranyman.
I'd fear for my life,
'cause I'd think it was a setup.
Theywere playing this song
the first timeyou and I had
drinks together at Rocky's Bar.
You rememberwhat theywere playing
at Rocky's Bar?
Not that I didn't have
a good time there, but I didn't.
My passion foryou is so intense,
it scares me.
Can'tyou see I've submerged it...
under a mask ofhostile acts
and cruel words?
Don't worry about it, 'cause I-I-I
never really took it seriously.
When you said you wanted to crush me
like an insect underyour heel,
thatwas justyourway ofsaying,
" Back offa little. "
Couldn'tyou see I was
just protecting myself?
- Miss Fitzgerald--
- Call me Betty Ann.
Look, Betty Ann,
I hate to be a killjoy, but, but, uh--
Ifthis is some kind ofscheme
to take adv-- it's notvery subtle.
You're the man I'm gonna marry.
I've known it since the first
moment I laid eyes on you.
Ifyou're gonna marry me,
we should call Bellevue.
You need a little
electric shock, honey.
- Would you kiss me?
- Me?
You want me to lay a wet one on you?
I've always imagined ifyou took me
in your arms and kissed me,
I could finallyfeel those fireworks
people talk about.
- Is this thewayyou are
awayfrom the office?
- What areyou thinking?
I'm thinking that it's a pity
we hate each other.
- By now, we could have
had a large family.
- I'm gonna swoon.
Steady, steady.
I affect women this way sometimes.
- I can't stay awake.
- Easy, easy.
- I just need to rest
my head on your shoulder.
- Easy, uh-- [ Coughs ]
I must rememberwhat soap
I used this morning.
## [ Big Band ]
## [ Big Band ]
- What the hell areyou doing here?
- Good morning, sweetheart.
Don't call me sweetheart.
What's going on?
I stayed awake all last night...
thinking about all those things
thatyou said,
and all ofthat rang
a very deep bell with me.
- What?
- Therewere so manytimes,
you know, when wewere
arguing in the office,
and I had the feeling that down deep,
underneath it all,
you were really crazy about me.
Crazy aboutyou?
What, wereyou dropped on your head?
No, hey, toots, I gotta tell you,
last night, for a cold fish,
you were hot stuff.
Listen, buster, don't call me "toots. "
I don't like it
any better than "sweetheart. "
I'm not one ofthose available
Annies who sits on your lap
whileyou give dictation.
What didyou do, sneak in here
andslip into myarms?
Hey, what's going on? You tried to
undress me last night and kiss me.
- What areyou talking about?
You came in here and passed out.
- Andnowthe news.
- I'm confused.
- The elusive jewel thief...
responsible forrobbing the Kensington
and Dillworth fortunes this week...
has struck again.
C. W. Briggs, a former employee
of North Coast Fidelity and
Casualty Company of New York,
is the chief suspect in the robbery
ofthe latest victim,
Adrian Greenwood of Manhattan.
The details ofthe crimewere
the same as the first two this week.
In addition to over
a million dollars in jewelry,
the thiefgot away
with a like amount of cash.
Police had recovered thejewels
from the earlier burglaries,
which led to the capture and arrest
ofthe prime suspect, C. W. Briggs.
So that's whyyou escaped
from the police.
Not to tryto proveyour innocence,
but becauseyou had unfinished business.
What kind ofbusiness?
I was herewith you!
Yeah, well, for some reason,
I'm having trouble remembering
all ofthat, but I was asleep.
Even ifyou came here to sleep,
you could have awakened,
robbed these people and then come back.
- You just used this as a safe haven!
- I could have,
but I didn't.
You tried to undress me and kiss me.
You are feeding me the wrong lie.
I've never tried
to undress you in my life,
and I wouldn't kiss you
ifwewere marooned
on a desert island for 20 years.
Wewould never be marooned for 20 years,
'cause after 20 minutes,
I'd make a bow and arrow and kill you.
What areyou thinking? I'm marrying
Chris Magruder, for God's sakes.
- You are?
- Yes.
We've set a spring date,
as soon as his divorce is final.
So ifI was undressing you
or trying to kiss you,
I must have multiple personalities.
Ifyou marry C. hris Magruder,
you have multiple stupidity.
Uh, yeah, it must have been
the booze last night,
but you were like a changed person,
and a much better one.
I'm gonna take a shower, and if
you're not gone when I get out,
I'm calling my local precinct.
For one minute,
you dropped your guard.
You were actually sexy,
even though when the light
hityou a certain way,
you, you tend to resemble Mussolini.
[ Sighing ]
Sh--
Pretty snazzyfor an officeworker.
Boy, Magruder must really
loveyou in an extravagantway.
Probably likes going to Paris with you
more than he does with his wife.
[C. W. ] I understand
youand C. harlie gotsomething forme.
[Man ] I don't knowabout C. harlie,
but I came up with a name.
[ C. W. ]
Really? Well, hit me. Lay it on me.
Eddie Polgar.
Eddie Polgar. Who's that?
It don't mean a thing to me,
but it's come up twice.
- Eddie Polgar?
- Yeah, yeah. There's no police record.
Could be an alias.
I don't know. It's all I could get.
Hey, hey, hey. Blue men coming.
Keep moving. Keep moving!
- Charlie.
- C. W., is thatyou?
- I got a messageyou wanted me.
- You're hot as a pistol.
" Hot"? The New York City Police want
to give me a lifetime achievement award.
Name Eddie Polgar
mean anything toyou?
- Zero.
- Nothin'. I can't get
a break, no matterwhat I do.
- Stickyour hand in the cup.
- In the cup?
In the cup. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Thirty- eight cents and a wad ofpaper.
Oh, and somebodythrew their gum away
in your business establishment.
Well, open thewad ofpaper.
- Why?
- It's a clue.
- What kind of clue?
- From last night's heist.
Coopersmiths found it
on the driveway on the property.
- Charlie, wh--
- The burglar dropped it getting away.
- How'dyouget it?
- I got a friend, who's got a friend...
who works in the same building
as the Coopersmith Agency.
- I thought maybeyou'd want it.
- Charlie, this is--
These earrings are grand larceny.
I see bythe look on yourface
I must've helped you.
[Earring Rattling In Tin C. up]
C. herchezla femme.
You know what that means, Charlie?
- What?
- Find the woman.
- Is there a woman?
- Well, first I thought so.
Then I didn't.
Now I think I got her.
You work next to a person foryears,
and then one day
the temptation's too great.
- I don't believe it. Not C. W.
It doesn't make sense.
- Why not?
Jill, I don't think any of us
expected it, but there is proofnow.
You heard Fitzgerald saw thejewels
sittin' in his apartment, right?
Yeah, and how he fought the cops
when they got the keyto his locker.
- To me it's open-and-shut.
- What?
- You don't run from the police
ifyou're innocent.
- That's what I'm sayin'.
What about the nerve it took
to strike twice? Come on, guys.
C. W. deserves some credit.
He turned out to be a pretty gutsy guy.
[Phone Ringing]
Hello. Where areyou?
Hello. Where areyou?
[C. W. ] Nevermind where I am.
I gotta get up to the office.
I- I think there's more people
involvedin this thing.
I- I-I-I think that Fitzgerald
is behind it.
Does the name...
Eddie Polgar mean anything to you?
No.
Look, I gotta get up to the office.
I wanna get through
the Coopersmiths' report.
I wanna check it out, and I wanna
check out Fitzgerald's desk again.
There's no question about it.
Fitzgerald is involved in this thing
up to her neck.
You can't let this woman and your
feelings for her coloryourjudgment.
It has nothing to do
with myfeelings for her.
It's the onlything
that makes any sense.
I go overto her house because I figured
no onewill look for me there...
'cause she hates me so.
I go to sleep. In the middle ofthe
night, I hear a noise, and I wake up.
I find her. I figure,
"All right, so she can't sleep either. "
But no. That's not what it is.
She had done the Greenwood heist, and
shewas coming back, and I caught her.
So naturally she starts
to actvery peculiar.
You know, she starts to--
I trap her.
So she starts seducing me
with herfemininewiles.
- Meaning what?
- Meaning all ofa sudden I'm handsome...
and I'm gorgeous and she
can't take her hands off--
Does that sound like Fitzgerald toyou,
or a schemertrying
to play me for a sucker?
Actually, it sounds like that magic show
demonstration byVoltan Polgar.
That's right.
Thatwas the night ofthe first robbery.
I don't know, C. W. I think
she has some real feelings foryou.
Don't be ridiculous.
She hates me.
Wh- Wh-What is the nameyou said
of, ofthe magician...
who now I've completely repressed?
Uh, Voltan.
Voltan the Inscrutable.
TheJade Scorpion.
- What is his name?
- Voltan Polgar.
Eli Voytak Polgar.
I'm... just theorizing...
on an incredible
sequence of events.
You look like my UncleJerry right after
the United Parcel truck hit him.
What happened? I knowyou described
this before, but, butwhat happened?
Th- They brought me onstage--
brought me onstage.
He putyou into a trance--
rather easily, despiteyour resistance.
Right. Yes. And then--
And then he brought Fitzgerald,
whowas with me at the time--
Andthenyou were awakened
in aposthypnoticstate...
with a word that would, uh,
putyou back under again.
Constantinople. Yeah,
then he started making these--
C. W.? C. W.?
Yes?
You okay?
I'm fine, Alvin.
How's your aging mother?
Obviously, he was never
released from the keyword.
Wake him up, George.
This is scary.
Don't be scared.
This stuff's right up my alley.
All right. Now, when I snap myfingers,
you will awaken.
Uh, you'll have no memory ofwhat
has occurred. Is that clear toyou?
- Yes.
- And you'll awaken...
feeling happy and, and, and refreshed.
- Is that clear?
- Yes.
So, the guy gets me onstage.
- Now, then what?
What took place after that?
- Wait a minute.
I have an idea. Constantinople.
My God. What a sense of power.
Doyou think thatyou can get him
to recall everything...
- and then set him loose
from the trance for good?
- All right.
Now, when I snap my fingers,
you will awaken.
Your memorywill be clear--
crystal clear.
All the events ofthe pastweek
will come toyou vividly...
and with no distraction.
You'll be completelyfreed
from yourtrance,
and the mention
oftheword Constantinople...
will have absolutely no meaning toyou.
Itwill not putyou back
intoyour hypnotic state.
One: You're coming out ofit.
Two: Your memories of
the past week are coming back.
Three: You're fully awake.
- I took the jewels!
The-- The Kensington jewels.
- What?
And the Dill-- Yes.
Yes, and of course.
And then he probably tried to get me--
couldn't get me, so he--
The Greenwood thing was her. Wha--
What is Fitzgerald's keyword?
Madagascar.
TheJade Scorpion
wants you to get the jewels.
Wrap them in plain brown paper
and bring them to him.
Mark down the following address
in Chinatown.
Miss Fitzgerald?
Miss Fitzgerald?
Miss Fitzgerald?
Sergeant, his name is Voltan Polgar.
Somebodyjust gave me
an address on him.
Oh, Miss Fitzgerald.
TheJade Scorpion welcomes you.
- You have my package.
- Yes.
Thankyou.
You will now return home.
You will go to sleep.
Itwill be a wonderful sleep
from which you will awaken cheerfully,
andyou will remembernothing
ofthese events.
In fact, you will have no memory
of any ofthis ever.
[Loud C. rash ]
I was just passing through.
I... thought I'd... say hello.
- [Voltan] C. W. Briggs.
- Yeah.
I seem to have underestimatedyou.
Story of my life.
Everybody underestimates me.
They-- You know,
they think I'm a pushover.
It makes mywork much easier.
I- I've seen some pretty exotic schemes,
Polgar, but this one was a beauty.
But I figured it out.
That's why I get top dollar.
Don't force me to take
extreme measures, Mr. Briggs.
Don't force me to take
extreme measures, Mr. Briggs.
You'd never pull that trigger.
Really? You think not. Why?
Murder's notyour game. I have
just an instinct that tells me that.
You know, you're a jewel thief.
There's a big difference between doing
a little time for stealing jewels...
and, you know, frying
in the electric chair.
Once they pump 200 million volts
of electricitythrough your body,
you have a tendencyto spend
the rest ofyour days in an ashtray.
[Tires Screeching]
For a minute, I thought
I overplayed my hand.
- [Siren Wailing]
- [Whistle Blowing]
You're the bravest, most brilliant,
most courageous man I've ever met,
and I would go to the end
ofthe earth with you.
You know, everybody should have somebody
that they feel that way about.
It's-- It's-- You know, it's such
a shame thatyou're gonna have to...
actuallywake up from this,
this fabulous illusion.
Just--Just once...
before the ugly curtain of reality...
drops on both of us.
[ Fitzgerald ]
Oh, you kiss great.
- What a wrap-up, huh?
- Did you see the look
on Herb Coopersmith's face?
- Serves him right.
- Hey, Al.
Where doyou think Miss Fitzgerald
and Mr. Magruder...
are gonna go
fortheir romantic getaway?
His divorce doesn't come
through for months. I hear
his wife couldn't care less.
- I hearthey're gettin' married in June.
- No.
I think I heard him
talking about going to Paris.
- Paris? Wow!
- [ Chattering ]
Mr. Magruder, I'm--
I just came to say I'm leaving.
Ah, C. W. Well, what can I say?
We all make mistakes, huh?
'Course, you've gotta admit, they did
have a pretty strong case againstyou.
- I don't know.
- I knowyou could get a job anywhere.
Ifyou decide to go,
you'll have our blessings.
Ifyou stay, you'll have a raise,
and I'll see to it Miss Fitzgerald
keeps out ofyourway.
Between us boys, oncewe marry,
she's gonna retire
whether shewants to or not.
I'm not having a wife at work
in my own office, for good measure.
Well, think positively. I'll be away
for a couple ofweeks myself.
Miss Fitzgerald and I
are going to Paris.
- Oh, yes? The actual city?
- Huh?
- No. Nothing.
- You need a vacation.
Why don'tyou see ifyou can get
that Laura Kensington girl to go with?
I wouldn't mind
some ofthat action myself.
She seems struck byyou.
She's a little demented, but, in
a hotel room, that can be a lot offun.
Just came to say good-bye.
Right. Chris and I
have a plane to catch.
No, by good-bye I mean I'm leaving.
I'm quitting.
Oh?
Shouldmakeyou veryhappy.
You can en joyyour vacation now.
'Cause when you come back,
you don't have to see me again.
You can revamp everything here.
No static.
Want to have a parting drink?
A drink at 10:00 in the morning?
It's onlytequila.
What can you say about a woman who keeps
a bottle of Mexican booze in her desk?
Let's drinkto both ofourfutures.
Yeah?
Today, Mr. Magruder.
Tomorrow, the world.
I will let that pass
because this is good-bye.
Mm. You're really gonna marry him?
I- I-- You know.
For a brilliant woman, I gotta say,
you have the worst taste in men.
I didn't take up with you.
How bad could mytaste be?
You know, behind--
underneath all those nasty remarks...
is a veryvulnerable,
sweet, sexywoman.
But don't ever let it come out,
because, you know, you could
run the risk ofbeing happy,
and I know that would kill ya.
Chris and I plan
on being very happy.
Your instinct told you
hewould never leave his wife.
My instincts are good,
but they're not infallible.
So this was onewhere I was wrong.
Have a-- Have a terrific
rest ofyour life...
and try not to jump
out ofanywindows.
Make sure the elevator's there
beforeyou get in,
because I heard ofa man who plunged
15 stories and wound up a vegetable.
I'll let that pass
'cause this is good-bye.
- That's what she said--
- Hey, Briggsie, I was just tellin' 'em.
You quit, I go with ya.
[John] That's right. C. W., youare
ourhero. This was a tough nut to crack.
No, this was all luck.
IfGeorge didn't know
magic or hypnosis,
you know,
I neverwould have known anything.
It's an amazing thing.
You can actually put somebody
under and then force them to do
the most outrageous things.
That is absolutelywrong.
A person will not do
anything under hypnosis that
theywouldn't do in real life.
- Is that true?
- Yeah.
- What areyou saying?
Th- Th-That I'm, at heart, a thief?
Well, we know there's
a little bit oflarceny in you.
I mean, you're the one who's always
saying it takes one to catch one.
Oh, well, there's also a little bit
oflarceny in Miss Fitzgerald.
I mean, thatwas kind ofa shock.
- There's a lot ofsurprises in her,
it turns out.
- Hey, come here.
Hey.
Hey.
You got a little crush
on her, don'tya?
- Who? Fitzgerald? What, areyou--
- [ Cackling ]
- What areyou talking about?
- Well, come on. I've always known it.
You can't hate somebody that much
without there being...
at least a little bit ofattraction
underneath it all.
- Says who?
- It's my instinct. Against all logic.
Come on, Briggsie. You were the one
who taught me to trust it.
I think I'm in lovewith her, but I--
It's the stupidest thing that's ever
happened to me. It's embarrassing.
Yeah, well, uh, you bettertake
the bull bythe horns.
She's out ofhere in about
three minutes. Look.
She's out ofhere in about
three minutes. Look.
Go!
Miss Fitzgerald, [ Clears Throat]
marry me.
- What?
- I guess C. W. 's had a few.
- Pretty earlyforthat, don'tyou think?
- I've had a little tequila, but--
Otherwise I wouldn't have
the nerve to saythis.
I'm in lovewith you.
I wantyou to marry me.
Mr. Briggs, you're embarrassing me.
You don't want to spend the rest of
your life with the wrong person...
- when it's meyou really love.
- C. W., you're making her uncomfortable.
Whatever could makeyou think
I could, in mywildest dreams,
think ofyou thatway, you--
Yeah, I know. " Nearsighted little
cockroach, " or something like that.
But can'tyou see the venom under that?
That's the beauty.
Betty, let's go.
C. W., leave here at once.
I thinkyour idea of moving
on professionallywasn't so crazy.
Hey, look, I'm opening up toyou.
I'm putting my heart in your hands.
I've been difficult because
I feared you, just likeyou feared me.
Because underneath, we know this is
the real thing, and it terrifies us.
Yes, I fearyou.
You and Boris Karloff.
- [ Sighs ]
- Out oftheway, C. W.
Your heroics do not entitleyou
to be an obnoxious boor.
How can a man confessing love
be an obnoxious boor?
[ Scoffs ]
I'm afraid Betty and I have big plans,
and they don't includeyou.
I- I-- You wanna spend the rest of
your life married to thewrong guy?
What makes you think I'd marryyou
even ifI wasn't gonna marry him?
- Stop talking about me
like I'm not here.
- Because it's meyou love.
[ Scoffs ] You are too old for me.
You are too nearsighted for me.
- You're too short for me.
- You're leaving out the best part.
- I'm also losing my hair.
- All right, C. W. Good-bye.
- And I mean for good.
- Wait-- Wait a minute.
[ Stammering ] Betty Ann.
Betty Ann, where areyou going?
- Madagascar?
- Someone call the plane
and tell them we might be late.
You go ahead, Chris.
I'm staying here.
[Magruder]
What?
I'm staying with C. W.
We have an announcement to make.
Betty Ann, you have
a crazy look in your eye.
I've never felt
so normal in my life.
I can't guarantee that every time
I kiss you there's gonna be fireworks.
I think I fell in lovewith you
the first second I laid eyes on you.
I want this woman helped!
Get an ambulance!
Uh, Miss Burke. Call mywife's attorney.
Have him halt the separation.
- I see trouble on the horizon.
- Don't worry, Mr. Magruder.
She'll takeyou back. There'll be a few
new ground rules, butyou can adapt.
- Gosh, so much passion
in a lousy insurance office.
- I know.
- No kiddin'.
- You never know.
Hey. Congratulations.
A little, uh,
going- away present forya.
So, should we...
get out ofhere and find someplace where
we can start making up for lost time?
How about my place?
I think I can livewith that.
Um, God bless everyone,
and, uh, God bless TinyTim.
- Shall we?
- Good luck, you two.
Hey, so, what's gonna happen
when she, you know,
wakes up and she's back
to her old self?
Guess the firstword out ofhis mouth
every morning has to be " Madagascar. "
My gosh, who'd have thunk it.
Hey, what a break for C. W.
that in all the commotion...
you forgot to deprogram
Miss Fitzgerald, huh?
What areyou talking about?
I didn't forget anything.
I deprogrammed her last night.
You don't have toworry.
I'll never leaveyou.
It's something you don't even
have to think about.
Tell me howyou feel about me.
You're the mostwonderful man
in theworld-- the handsomest,
the most brilliant, the sexiest.
You know, someday I'm gonna
makeyou feel those things.
Just, just reallyfeel them.
Anything's possible.
