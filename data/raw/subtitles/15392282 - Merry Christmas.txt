No!
{\an8}- Cheers!
- Cheers!
{\an8}- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
Everyone seems so happy.
Perhaps they assume we're happy as well.
I'm quite happy.
Aren't you?
I don't know.
I'll bet Jerome is very happy though.
Jerome?
Her father.
My husband.
He's gone to Vikram Colony.
Probably screwing some woman.
Skirt-chaser...
I'm sorry.
{\an8}"The night is darkest before dawn."
Okay!
Hello!
Hello! Up here.
Could you hand me that screwdriver?
Hey!
Albert!
The very same. Hi, Uncle!
Wait, I'll be right down.
Careful.
Albert!
Uncle.
You're back after ages!
And look...
The whole town celebrates!
Good start!
Come, let's go home.
Come.
The house had been
locked up for a long time.
So it was a little musty.
I had it cleaned because you were coming.
As long as your mother was here,
she kept her home spotless,
even when sick.
She didn't suffer much.
She went to sleep and never woke up.
We tried all means to contact you.
But we couldn't reach you.
Every time you wrote
about the terrible food there
I'd feel so bad for you.
After your mother's vision began to fail
it was I who read out your letters to her
and wrote the replies as well.
She'd ask me to read
them over and over again.
Thanks, Uncle.
For everything.
No need to thank me, Albert.
Wait, I'll be right back.
Albert!
Uncle.
Welcome home, Albert!
After retirement,
this has become my thing.
Home-made. Enjoy it.
{\an8}Yadhoom.
Is it an Arabic name?
It is derived from
a Scandinavian philosophy.
An experience of sorts.
In our world,
there are so many beings, big and small.
But why are they here?
To experience one moment.
When that moment finally arrives...
they realize that the purpose
of their existence,
which has spanned millions of years,
has guided them to this very point.
And it is that moment,
that validates the existence
of the life lived thus far
and the life that lies ahead.
And that is Yadhoom.
When I tasted my home-brew
for the first time...
I experienced it.
That's why I have given it the same name.
Albert.
Your Yadhoom may
not be inside this bottle.
But when that moment comes, don't miss it.
I'll get going.
Albert.
Here are your house keys.
Why don't you come
over for dinner tonight?
Auntie has made bobo curry.
Can I come another day?
I plan to go out today.
Good idea!
Bye then.
Is Kamdar sir there?
My name is Albert Arogyaswami.
Please tell him I called.
Here, keep this.
- I'm going to keep it there.
- Yeah.
Ten rupees.
Hello, sir.
How may I help you?
I'll take this one.
Albert?
Celine's son?
So you're back.
How was Dubai?
Too much discipline.
Hello, sir. How many?
Just me, I'll go to the bar.
Okay, this way, sir. Please come.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
In the inky blue skies
O stars that swim through
My heart, too, yearns
To become like you
The radiance of love
Gathers in my heart
The relentless pain
Kills me a little, every day
Even with a missed beat
A song is still a song
For melodies bloom from
The rain of love's words
Joy...
Flows like an endless wave
In my life
Thank you.
Chetan, some hot water, please.
Yes, okay.
I'm expecting a call,
- will you let me know?
- Okay.
- Sorry, sir!
- No, come in!
Bro, I need a favor.
Do you see a teddy bear
sitting at a table outside?
Yes.
A lady and a child are sitting there.
Can you go tell them
that I left in a hurry?
And ask them not to wait for me.
Thank you!
Thanks a lot, dude!
Shall I feed you?
Yummy sauce, right?
Excuse me, ma'am?
He left as something urgent came up.
- He asked you not to wait for him.
- Who?
The guy in the suit, with the red tie.
Close-cropped hair.
He fled without telling me his name.
Thank you.
I think he really did
have some urgent work.
That's why he left in a hurry.
Yes.
Evening may flee
Eat your food!
Don't play with your food, eat it!
But morning still arrives
Everything is bound to change
So relish the chaos of life
Savor the honey of desire
Without shackles holding you back
I said don't play with your food!
- Eat quickly!
- Laugh with abandon
Spread the wings of passion
-Love is not born of pleasure alone
-Sorry, baby.
Shall I get you an ice cream?
An ornament of sorrow
Adorns the threshold of love
Excuse me.
One strawberry ice cream, please.
Without the drug of love
Is there any purpose to life?
Everything your eyes seek
Love's magic brings
It within your grasp
You may not know what tomorrow holds
O pleasure, do not languish in yearning
To relentlessly plunge into the depths
And retrieve the pearl of love
That is a boon
Does the sun serve
A purpose without the rain?
So it is only when we rise above sorrow
That we find heaven
Only if we always seek...
To celebrate
Will there be bliss
Three tickets.
Come. Here.
Yes.
Okay? Subbu's fine.
Do you want to go to the bathroom?
Hey, leave Subbu here!
Uncle will watch him.
Excuse me...
Will you watch him?
Yeah, I'll take care of him.
Thanks.
Thank you.
He tried to escape a couple of times.
But I convinced him to stay.
No popcorn.
Popcorn!
How much?
Thank you.
There's no point
in watching a movie without popcorn.
What is your name?
Annie.
Annie, do you like the popcorn?
Is it good?
Annie, won't you talk to me?
Why?
Actually,
she cannot speak.
Oh, I'm sorry.
And the nose got longer...
and longer... and longer!
- Father!
- Don't "father" me now, Pinocchio!
But Pinocchio... Pinocchio! My son!
I'm so happy to see you again!
Me too, Father!
We are all together again!
I'd like to kick your head.
Oh!
Pinocchio!
What's the matter?
Gesundheit!
We're going to die!
Not if we make it faster! Faster!
We made it!
Thank you.
Shall I call a taxi?
No, that's okay.
My house is close by.
I'll walk.
Maybe I could escort this big guy home?
And the film?
I've already seen it.
It was my favorite story as a child.
I'd often check if my nose grew if I lied.
When I was a kid, not anymore.
Looks like he's getting sleepy as well.
Where's your house?
- Behind the fire station.
- Oh.
My place is opposite Behram Manzil.
It's Christmas Eve...
won't your family be waiting for you?
I don't have anyone.
Until last year, I had my mother.
Now only her memories linger in the house.
Come.
I don't even remember
what my parents looked like.
They died when I was Annie's age.
I don't know what is more heartbreaking.
To live without someone.
Or to suddenly lose someone you love.
What kind of work do you do?
I'm an architect.
You may have seen the hideous
buildings outside the city.
They were all designed by me.
Maybe you've seen those brochures...
"If you buy a home here,
your joy will bubble over."
Won't it?
What do you do?
Nothing major.
I run a small bakery.
Family business.
We supply butter biscuits to canteens.
Superb business!
Serving cake to people
first thing in the morning!
Can't imagine a sweeter
profession than that.
If you don't mind, I could carry her.
Careful.
She's heavy.
She's just a baby.
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Everyone seems so happy.
Perhaps they assume we're happy as well.
I'm quite happy.
Aren't you?
I don't know.
I'll bet Jerome is very happy though.
Jerome?
Her father.
My husband.
He's gone to Vikram Colony.
Probably screwing some woman.
Skirt-chaser...
- You know, in life...
- Yeah, yeah.
I know.
"The night is darkest just before dawn."
That's it, right?
Jerome's always lived
his life the way he likes.
So I figured...
why should I be home alone on Christmas?
I'll also go on a date.
A revenge date.
Sort of.
The guy sounded good over the phone.
Investment banker.
I didn't expect such a big fiasco though.
Why? What happened?
I'd told him that I was a single mother.
I guess he didn't expect
me to bring my child on a date!
After a perfunctory "Hi, hello!"
he excused himself to go to the washroom.
Well, you know what happened after that.
Yeah.
He left his beer behind as well!
We can leave any number
of things behind in life.
But abandoning
a chilled beer is just wrong.
Can I offer you a drink?
I'll drink anything fermented...
except dosa batter.
Please come in.
Thank you.
Your house is beautiful.
Oh! It's a mess.
What will you have?
Whiskey? Wine?
Whiskey.
Sorry, there's no ice.
- Is that okay?
- No problem.
Please help yourself.
Music?
Annie?
Didn't you see how soundly
she slept in the theater?
She's used to sleeping in noisy places.
What will you have?
You start. I'll put Annie to bed first.
Is this Jerome?
Yes, it was taken on
our honeymoon in Mauritius.
You both look so happy
in these photos though.
Have you ever seen people
frame photos of themselves crying?
Mummy has some cleaning work to do.
Don't be scared, go to sleep.
Only then will Santa
leave you lots of gifts.
Okay, my love?
Thank you, baby.
For not letting Mummy go mad.
Oh my God!
What did I do?
Oh.
You haven't touched your drink!
Were you waiting for me?
No...
I'm not that nice a guy.
This is my second.
Do you see this fish?
It's called the blue marlin.
It's not like other fish.
It's very hard to catch.
But I insisted that
he release it back into the sea.
At this moment, it must be
in some corner of the Indian Ocean...
swimming around happily.
Do you think it still remembers?
Definitely. How can it forget?
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
Feet can't help but swing
Creating a mural of joy
The twinkling stars in the sky
Sing a song to celebrate
Bedecked in brilliant hues
This is the day for elated singing
The lapwing beckons you
With its joyous rhythm
Home, threshold and everything else
Transforms into the Garden of Eden
Even the stork turns into a nightingale
All around the manger
Stars shine bright
As unbridled joy dances solo
Before you can ask, we say
Merry Christmas!
With delicious cake, we say
Merry Christmas!
The chariot of time arrives
Don't go before glimpsing what awaits
Neither the buzzing bee
Nor the gentle breeze
Seeks to touch anyone's heart
The chariot of time arrives
Don't go before glimpsing what awaits
Neither the buzzing bee
Nor the gentle breeze
Seeks to touch anyone's heart
It is the day when the sky blooms
And the fragrance of love is in the air
Even unsung tunes turn into ballads
Pleasure, once dormant, now flows
Feet can't help but swing
Making a mural of joy
The twinkling stars in the sky
Sing a song to celebrate
Bedecked in brilliant hues
All around the manger
Stars shine bright
Before you can ask, we say
Merry Christmas!
I've never done this before in my life.
Even I've only ever danced in my head.
I don't know what came over me today.
My shyness seems to have vanished.
You asked, and I just danced.
No...
I mean, I've never brought
a stranger home to chill with.
From now on...
I should do this more often.
Superb.
Great idea!
Count me in, if you like.
Okay.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Cheers!
Cheers!
So, tell me.
Are you single?
Or have you hidden your
wedding ring in your pocket?
Is this a magic trick?
Or are you married?
Take a good look at it.
It's beautiful.
Whose is it?
Rosie's.
Who's Rosie?
That's a long story.
That's okay.
Give me the abridged version.
The...
idea of love at first sight...
I thought that only happened to men.
But it happened to Rosie when she saw me.
I felt like I couldn't live without her.
She felt like she
couldn't live without me.
So we decided to be together.
Enter the villains in the story.
My mother did not like Rosie.
Rosie's husband did not like me.
Rosie was my boss' wife.
We turned a deaf ear
to everything and went off to Goa.
We had an amazing three months there.
Her husband even sent
the signed divorce papers to our hotel.
I thought I'd surprise her with this news.
I bought this ring and went to the hotel.
But she had a surprise for me instead.
She had left me a letter
and gone back to her husband.
And that's my love story. The End.
Then why do you still carry
the ring around in your pocket?
The day I forget her, I'll throw it away.
Only if you throw it,
will you be able to forget her.
Are you hoping to be
with her again someday?
No.
She won't come back.
She's dead.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That's all right.
It has been seven years since she died.
Even my mother
passed away around that time.
I also left town.
I returned today after many years.
I don't know which is worse...
the death of a loved one
or the death of love itself.
- Refill?
- Yes.
Even I met Jerome exactly seven years ago.
I was in a horrible
relationship at the time.
Jerome was actually his friend.
He used to come on a Kawasaki bike.
Just the sound of that
bike would thrill me.
Going for a ride on that bike,
felt like I was moving away
from all my troubles.
I'd tell my boyfriend
I was going for a movie.
Then I'd go meet Jerome.
Mind you, we were just friends.
He gave me a lot of courage.
That courage helped me
get out of that awful relationship.
On the very day that I broke it off,
Jerome proposed to me.
It wasn't a surprise to me.
I was happy.
Our love soared
like a ride on a giant wheel.
We got married three weeks later.
The whole thing had a Casablanca feel.
But an ascending giant wheel
also descends at the same speed.
That was when I discovered
the "real" Jerome.
One day I went to a movie by myself.
When I returned, he was waiting at home.
He was furious.
Before we were married,
whenever I went to meet Jerome,
I'd tell my ex-boyfriend
I was going to a movie.
So Jerome assumed I was
meeting someone else the same way.
The logic was correct.
But after that, he was
always suspicious of me.
Everything turned into a fight.
He started doing drugs.
And then...
he began to act like a psycho.
He stopped coming home on most days.
One day, I followed him
to see where he was going.
He was with another woman.
I confronted him.
He turned the tables on me
and said that it was my fault.
This is what all abusers
want their victims to believe.
It's an old trick.
I can ignore that as well.
But to date,
he believes that Annie is not his child.
He's convinced of this.
That's what is...
I don't know what happened...
My once-happy child suddenly
stopped talking one day.
Anyway, forget all that.
Let's ditch these old tales.
Don't you know
how to make anything besides swans?
I can make rockets.
Boats, rabbits.
- My mother taught me.
- Oh.
I thought you were making the
"Flying Swan Paper Wish."
What's the "Flying Swan Paper Wish"?
Haven't you ever done it?
It's a Japanese ritual.
I'll teach you.
Make two more swans.
Quick, make a wish!
Make a wish!
Oh, man!
I couldn't think of anything!
Okay, let's try again.
Okay, you try.
Okay, my turn.
Last chance.
What did you wish for?
- It won't come true if I tell you.
- Oh, please!
- That's just a superstition.
- Yo!
This whole thing is a superstition.
All right, fine.
Before I kidnapped you,
what was your plan for the evening?
I had planned to go to a good restaurant,
meet a beautiful girl there,
then watch a movie with her,
walk her home,
then, to recover from the long walk...
have a couple of drinks,
and chat with her.
What next?
That is for her to decide.
Is that so?
Pick one.
Good choice.
I'll just be back.
Annie is fast asleep.
We can go and come back quickly.
Do I look okay?
Okay?
You look dazzling.
- Where are we going?
- Time travel.
This dazzling dress is my time machine.
Seven years ago,
when I wore it for the first time...
I wasn't married.
I didn't have a child.
I lived life the way I wanted to.
It was a happy time for you too, right?
{\an8}Come.
Let's go back to that time.
What if the lift doors open
and Jerome is standing there?
What will you do?
I'd say, "Hi, sir.
Hello, sir. Merry Christmas, sir."
And I'd introduce myself.
We've hung out for so many hours.
You haven't even told me your name.
But you'll tell him?
Oh, damn! I'm so sorry!
Let's remain strangers.
It's nice.
I cannot fathom why
I cannot grasp the reason why
Every time you draw close
I cannot make sense of anything
Even the stoniest heart
Floats like a feather
You don't mean that.
My heart hurtles in one direction
My soul tumbles in another
But I can't even feel either
I love treading the same path with you
Is that so?
This love that has never been seen before
Pounces on my heart
Like a wild boar
Despite being a man, I blush
As a raging fire swirls around
Do you believe in God?
Yes, in times like this.
How about you?
It's not about whether I believe in God.
But when I meet God someday
will He believe in me?
Just like your dress,
I have a time machine spot as well.
Okay.
Now I can fathom why
Now I understand the reason why
Whenever you draw near
Everything makes sense to me
Once again the lips curve into a smile
Perhaps...
I know that my heart leaps like a monkey
While my mind aches
To douse the fire of its thoughts
As soon as I lay my eyes on you
Sweetness pervades the world
Is that really true?
{\an8}In your love, even the endless sky
{\an8}-Becomes putty in your hands
- "Albert the Ultimate."
My song that was unheard thus far
Unfolds when you speak
Hey, the fire station!
- Your house is close by, right?
- Yes.
The first left.
Shall we go?
I need to tell you something.
When I saw you
at the restaurant for the first time,
I was reminded of Rosie.
Do I look like Rosie?
No.
It just seemed that way to me.
Please come in.
These are my parents.
That's me and my dad
when I was in seventh grade.
You look around, I'll be right back.
Wine?
My neighbor made this at home.
Even I'm tasting it for the first time.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
It's pretty good, right?
I'll tell him.
This is my room.
It's been opened up after many years.
{\an8}- "Night Rose by..."
- Don't read that!
Hey!
- Give it back!
- No!
No, no, no!
Give it!
Okay, fine!
"Night Rose, Part Three,
by Gilbert."
Gilbert?
In case the book became a bestseller
I used a pseudonym.
Okay.
No!
No, no, no!
Mr. Albert...
Oh my God, what have you written?
I'm so sorry.
How old were you when you wrote this?
Fourteen.
Are you okay?
There was a wine stain.
My favorite dress.
Are you getting late?
Annie...
Time travel wasn't as easy as I thought.
- Sorry.
- Please don't apologize.
I feel like I've been watching
a movie for the last three hours.
I don't even know if
it was real or a dream.
So before the alarm rings and wakes me,
I should leave.
It's almost time for Santa's visit.
Why not stay back and see him?
Your Japanese ritual really works!
My name is Maria.
Jerome?
Jerome?
Jerome?
Jerome?
Annie...
Annie...
Annie!
It's okay, come.
- Jerome...
- It's okay... come.
Relax...
It's okay...
Not there. No.
Sit here.
- Jerome...
- Sit, I'll take care of it.
Sit, and relax. I'll check.
Is this his gun?
Yes, it's Jerome's gun.
Ambulance...
Let's call the hospital.
There's no pulse.
Let's call the police.
Please call them.
Can you check what that is?
That's my...
That's the note I left for Jerome.
No...
We shouldn't touch anything.
Let the cops come.
What happened?
I should go,
my presence will make things worse.
Why?
If I'm here when the police come,
it will mean trouble for you.
I don't understand.
I was in jail for murder.
I only got out this morning, Maria.
Murder?
What are you blabbering?
Rosie...
I killed Rosie.
I killed her.
I'm sorry, Maria.
I'll go.
If I'm here when the cops come
they'll suspect that we
conspired to kill him together.
Get out.
Please...
Please leave.
I'm sorry.
Leave!
Get out!
I said get out!
Get out of here, please!
Just one minute.
One minute.
What the hell are you doing?
- Go!
- Yes, yes, yes.
Get out, please!
Get the hell out of here!
Don't just stand there!
Just one minute.
Get out!
Can't you hear me?
I'll go, Maria. Just give me a minute.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Yeah, Maria, I'm leaving.
I'm sorry, Maria.
If it was anything else,
I'd be right by your side.
Are you going to leave or not?
Albert.
Why?
That's what I've been
telling you all this while!
I wasn't paying attention.
- This isn't going to work out, Albert.
- Why the hell not?
This is not practical!
- What's not practical?
- This...
Why didn't you think about this before?
You're still refusing to think about it!
I love you.
And I love you.
This is why I like you.
This is exactly why we belong together.
And we just discussed
why that's not possible.
Okay, fine.
I'm hungry.
I've made fresh gunpowder.
Deliziosa!
I could spend my whole life
just eating your dosas!
My dosa trance made me say that.
I get it.
If there's one thing I can ace,
it's making dosas.
Just like how Ilaiyaraaja writes music.
Or how Einstein writes equations.
If there's one thing
the world will remember Albert for,
it will be these dosas.
For you...
for our three children...
till my last breath...
every single day...
I'll be making piping hot dosas.
One kid like you,
one like me, and one like both of us.
We give the girl a boy's name.
And the boy, a girl's name.
All their names will start with "Z."
They won't be first on
the roll call for any assignments.
I've been wracking my brain for a few days
on how to propose smoothly.
Then this idea struck me.
No more dosa for me.
I'm asking you one last time.
Please, Rosie, let's get married.
Albert...
You're killing me.
We were having a happy conversation.
About our home, our children.
Then I proposed to her.
I don't remember anything
that happened after that.
After a while, I saw her lying dead.
Police station or court...
I'll admit it anywhere you want me to.
It was I who killed Rosie.
I killed Rosie.
One black coffee.
How much?
Two rupees, sir.
Four coffees.
Hello, Madam.
Where are you going
at this hour with a child?
Midnight Mass at the church.
It's a festive time.
One can't predict what kind
of lowlifes will be around.
It's too risky to go alone.
Look out for a cab.
{\an8}Madam, you wait on the side.
Stop.
Thank you.
Make sure you drop her off safely.
Bye! Goodbye!
Cute baby.
St. Jude's Church...
Sorry, brother!
Brother! Sorry!
Sorry, brother!
Sorry, brother!
Sorry, brother!
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Ring Christmas bells, merrily ring
Tell all the world Jesus is King!
Joy to the world
The Lord has come
Let Earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
-And heaven and nature sing
-Heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing
Joy to the world
The Lord has come
Let Earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
-And heaven and nature sing
-Heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing
Joy to the world
The Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
- Rocks, hills, and plains...
- Hey! What is it?
-Repeat the sounding joy
-What happened?
Repeat the sounding joy
-Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
-Careful. It's okay, I got you.
He rules the world
With truth and grace
-And makes the nations prove
-Careful!
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
- Careful, there are steps here.
- And wonders of His love
- Sit there. Careful.
- And wonders, and wonders of His love
Watch your head.
Brother, just keep an eye on her.
I'll bring my car.
There's a hospital nearby.
Maria?
Please, go away.
Go!
Are you fine?
Your watch.
I found it in the church.
- You're okay?
- Yeah.
Please take care.
Come, let's go. Come.
Get up slowly.
Take it slow. Careful.
{\an8}The car is right here. Come.
{\an8}Watch your step.
Careful. Sit inside.
Brother, will you drive the car?
You sit in the front, sweetie.
Which hospital are we going to?
Bombay Hospital.
No need.
Can you drop me home instead?
I feel better now.
There's no need for a hospital.
Are you sure?
Where's your house?
Rose Manor.
Opposite to Behram Manzil.
Are you Rose?
Maria.
Ronnie.
My name is Albert. Hi.
Hi!
- Watch it. Give it to me.
- Thank you.
- Careful.
- Sweetheart...
- Shall I carry that? Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I'm so sorry I ruined your Christmas.
Oh, no, that's perfectly all right.
Can I offer you a drink?
You bet.
Albert?
It's Christmas Eve.
Won't your family be waiting for you?
Just a second.
The Good Lord knew how to place me
in the right place at the right time.
I'm a lone wolf.
Exquisitely made.
I meant the lift.
Once again, I'm sorry.
You probably had other plans.
No, no, nothing like that.
Please come in.
Wow. Beautiful house.
Sorry, it's a bit of a mess.
Two minutes, baby.
What can I get you?
Whatever you have.
Whiskey?
- Wine?
- Whiskey, always.
Oh.
Sorry, there's no ice. Is that okay?
No problem.
Please help yourself.
I'll play some music.
- Albert, how about you? Whiskey?
- Yeah.
- So, what's your poison?
- I'll just put her to bed and come back.
Come, baby.
Please be comfortable.
Brother, Christmas has just become
"Merry Christmas."
- What's this?
- It's a family custom.
Cheers!
Hey!
- She's decorated the tree so beautifully.
- Yeah, yeah.
So many ornaments.
This is the best.
Come check out this birdcage.
Wow.
The house is gorgeous.
The music is superb.
Everything has a touch
of what she has... class.
This must be her husband.
He doesn't look that classy.
Did you look at her face?
Either they're divorced
or her husband is dead.
I'll bet you also thought the same!
I have no doubt that he's dead.
Albert.
Come, sit here.
Would such a beautiful girl
with a young child, be all by herself?
Not a chance!
Have you ever watched
the film The Merry Widow?
So, tell me.
- What work do you do?
- Architect. From Dubai.
Are you here for the Christmas break?
I have a catering business.
High-end parties,
celebrity weddings, and stuff like that.
In fact, I have seven orders today.
And one of those...
is a yacht party.
So, brother...
Is it worth a shot?
What is?
It's Christmas, and she's all alone.
She fainted as well.
She needs someone to comfort her.
What do you say?
Just leave.
I think not.
Let's both give it a shot.
Whoever doesn't get lucky
will bid the other good luck and leave.
Gentleman's agreement.
I like your attitude!
I'm guessing I won't
face any trouble from you.
- I'm warning you...
- What the hell's your problem?
My watch is missing.
- I think it fell off in the church.
- Did you check in your purse?
How can it be in her purse?
Did the watch fall off
and then jump into her purse?
It must be at the church.
If we go right away,
we can get it back. Let's go.
We can drop Albert home on the way.
His family is waiting for him.
What say, Albert?
Annie is fast asleep.
- We can go and come back quickly.
- Sure.
Do you mind?
Not at all.
A note for my husband.
In case he comes back
and wonders where I am.
- May I?
- Yeah.
Sorry for all the trouble.
- It's my mother's watch.
- Oh. Brother...
Will this do?
Ronnie sir...
That film we spoke about...
"Me today, You tomorrow," right?
No, it's... "You today, Me tomorrow."
I'm sure you're right.
The golden sky sprinkles rose water...
Annie?
Annie, look who's here!
It's Santa!
Annie, it's me, Santa!
What are you doing here?
Come out.
Mom will be back any minute now.
Come.
Come on out.
Very good.
Don't cry.
Until Mummy comes back...
shall I tell you a story?
Shall we invite all our friends as well?
Come on, everyone!
Everyone, gather around.
I'll narrate a tale.
What story shall we hear today?
The swan one?
Or shall I tell you the fish story?
In a land far away,
there was a huge ocean.
And in that ocean lived
a little baby fish and her mother.
They both sang beautifully.
One day, an evil demon
fell in love with their singing.
He captured both of them!
The mummy fish somehow
managed to free her baby
and helped her escape.
When they reached the shore,
the demon took her mummy away.
The little fish wept and wept.
A bearded hermit was
meditating on the shore.
He asked, "What's that sound?
Who's there?"
The little fish told him
everything that had happened.
After listening to her sad story, he said,
"All right,
I'm going to give you a pair of wings.
Put on the wings
and fly off to find your mother.
But if you want these wings...
you'll have to give me something
that is very dear to you."
So the little fish
thought about it and said,
"I love to sing.
So you can have my voice."
And then the little fish sprouted wings...
but she lost her voice.
The hermit was touched by her sacrifice.
He gave her a teddy bear.
"If you are ever in trouble,
he will help you.
This teddy is your friend," he said.
And so the little fish
took the teddy and flew off,
searching high and low for her mother.
And then she spotted her mother.
But alas!
The demon had locked her mother in a cage.
He was tormenting her to make her sing.
The little fish tried all
kinds of ways to free her mother.
"I have to save her," she thought.
But being a tiny little fish,
she could do nothing.
She just began to cry in despair.
"Mom!" she sobbed.
As she cried,
her teardrops fell on the teddy bear.
And in the blink of an eye,
it grew as tall as a palm tree!
Then it marched up to the demon
and roared, "Hey!
What do you think you're doing?"
Pow! Pow! Pow!
Teddy saved the mother and baby fish.
The little fish and her
mother were together again.
Then the mother fish said,
"Let's go thank the hermit
who helped us so much."
Off they went.
I think you should have gambled all of it!
Maria... truth.
I feel unusually nervous around you.
"My lord," said the mother fish.
"Please give my daughter's
voice back to her!"
The hermit said, "I'm sorry,
I don't have the power to do that.
But there is another way.
If you promise not to cry
and remain brave...
I have a friend who is also a hermit.
Some day he will appear before you.
And he will say, 'Abracadabra'
and the next second,
you'll start speaking again!"
Then the mother and baby fish
swam happily into the ocean.
Did you like the story?
Not good?
No?
Okay...
Shall I tell you a story about a forest?
Jerome!
Oh, shit!
Maria, don't touch anything!
Mom's back. You're safe now. Rest well.
I'll go. Bye.
Annie!
Annie?
What happened? You didn't sleep?
I'll call the police.
This is Ronnie Fernandez.
Everything's okay.
It looks like suicide.
Did you hear anything? No?
Don't worry, it's nothing.
- Sir, the landmark is Jupiter Bakery.
- Mom's right here.
Close your eyes. Sleep.
Sir, please come quickly.
-My friend
-I'll be right back.
and her little girl are very distressed.
We haven't touched anything.
Okay, sir.
Okay.
Get out.
Get out!
I said go!
Maria!
Is Annie okay?
Yes.
She's okay.
Give me two minutes
to put her back to bed.
No problem, take your time.
I'll take care of everything.
Annie?
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Mom has some work to do. You sleep.
I'll come back soon.
Let's go out.
Do you not remember me?
O the follies of youth!
Do you not remember me?
O the follies of youth!
Our time together was fleeting
Oh, heart, you have forgotten!
How's Annie?
The cops will be here any minute.
Sit down.
Slowly.
Will you stay with me till the cops come?
Of course, Maria. I'll be right here.
What should we tell the police?
The truth.
That's best for everyone.
But we both should tell the same truth.
Or else it will become a lie.
You fainted at church.
I came along to help you.
You offered me a drink as a thank you.
Your watch was missing.
We locked up the house
and went back to the church.
We got the watch and returned home.
We found the door open.
When we entered, we saw this.
Let's not mention Albert in this.
Why get a good man in trouble?
- Madam.
- Sir...
Maria.
Be brave, I'm right here.
Ma'am.
{\an8}Thirty years of service can affirm that
{\an8}"Clean hands need no gloves."
{\an8}Wear gloves, it seems!
{\an8}You went to the church
to look for your watch.
You found it immediately.
Then why did it take
you two hours to return home?
Madam, that's my fault.
{\an8}What do you mean?
Sir, there was a celebrity party.
I am the caterer for it.
I went to check if everything
was going smoothly.
She accompanied me.
{\an8}You just met her today, right?
{\an8}Yes, sir.
{\an8}Are you married?
Yes, I'm married.
He told you he was unmarried, right?
{\an8}What do you think?
Could this be suicide? Or something else?
I don't know, sir.
I'm not able to think straight right now.
My child is inside.
You go and answer his questions.
Do you have any idea
how he got this revolver?
Have you seen it before?
Yes, I have.
I asked him about it.
He said he had many enemies
- and that he bought it as a precaution.
- Oh.
Enemies?
But in reality, he has no such enemies.
It was all in his mind.
Was he schizophrenic?
Delusions or something?
- Drugs.
- Oh.
Has he ever attempted suicide before?
No.
But he hasn't been himself
for quite a while now.
He's been very agitated.
Come!
Watch it!
May I sit down for a bit?
Of course, please sit.
You can sit down, as well.
Murali!
Go to the police station and...
Do you have any friends
or relatives close by?
You can go spend the night there
and come to the station in the morning.
By then,
the postmortem report will be ready.
Did you hear any noise?
Did you hear anything?
She won't talk no matter what I ask.
What's your name, dear?
Don't be scared.
We are all your mother's friends.
Don't be afraid.
She cannot speak!
We've been consulting a doctor.
If you put two drops of
honey on the tongue every day,
it will help her to talk.
Shall we sleep?
I thought this case
would drag on for months.
But it's an open-and-shut case.
We can close it by tomorrow
and get a warrant.
- Head Constable madam.
- Yeah.
I have a hundred questions
running in my head.
And you're saying
it's an open-and-shut case.
{\an8}Husband and wife haven't
been getting along for a while.
So she has a secret
affair with this hotel guy.
{\an8}The husband finds out.
{\an8}For days, he's been planning
on catching them red-handed.
{\an8}So today, he lies about going out.
He quietly returns home.
Then he gets drunk.
And he waits, gun in hand.
Unaware of this, these two come home.
Just as he suspected,
the two are together.
He tries to shoot.
But he's drunk, they're sober.
So they shoot him instead.
And make it look like a suicide.
Come with me.
The house is filled with crime novels.
They could've swiped
an idea from one of these.
Your experience alone
cannot always show us the way.
Sometimes we have to take
emotions into account as well.
It was obvious from
the way the girl was crying.
She wasn't lying.
Just by looking at someone
can we not discern...
whether they're murderers or not?
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Can we not tell from looking at someone?
It's written all over her face.
It is the end of the year.
Let's quickly wrap up the case.
Hey!
What the hell are you
doing at the crime scene?
Get out!
Sir, it's just that... my wallet...
- Get out!
- I had left it here, sir.
Hey, Milind!
Why the hell aren't you
keeping an eye on things?
- It has sentimental value, sir.
- Sir, come with me.
There are important
documents in it, madam.
- Okay, come with me.
- Come to the police station.
- Why should I come there?
- Come!
- I've told you everything I know!
- Come.
My kids are waiting for me at home!
Maria, what's this?
Just come!
My family is waiting for me!
Madam.
{\an8}We're sealing this room just for tonight.
{\an8}With disruptions like these,
it's hard to solve the case.
{\an8}Have you decided where you want to go?
{\an8}I'll drop you off myself.
{\an8}No, we don't have anyone else.
{\an8}We'll stay here.
{\an8}Are you going to stay in that room?
I've been meaning to ask.
Such a big commotion has happened here.
But not a single peep
from any of your neighbors.
Are you the only one
who lives in this building?
Sir, there are only
offices in the building.
They're all shut for Christmas.
We have a bakery downstairs.
That's why we live up here.
Come, let's take a look at the bakery.
What time do you open the bakery?
At 8:00 a.m.
It's very good.
Welcome.
What will you have?
Whiskey or wine?
Maria!
Creating a replica
of your house on the floor above
must have taken so much time
and a lot of planning.
It would've taken so many days.
Wow.
Jerome's dead body on the second floor...
And on the third floor...
This.
I got rid of all the swans.
But that sparrow escaped.
What do you want?
What do you want?!
Why are you always sniffing
around like a horny dog?
You may have committed a murder
but I believe you have
justice on your side.
Tell me how you did it.
I'll help you in any way I can.
Trust me!
However you look at it, I'm your senior
by seven years in the art of murder.
You both look so happy
in these photos though.
Have you ever seen people
frame photos of themselves crying?
Jerome always stocked
more drugs than he needed.
I kept stealing a little
at a time and hiding them.
To knock him out, I mixed
the whole lot in his whiskey today.
I'd rehearsed the whole thing
in my head at least a thousand times.
When the music playing above
reached its crescendo...
I would shoot Jerome.
Maria?
Maria...
Merry Christmas.
What's wrong?
For what he has done to Annie...
I would murder him over and over again.
What is your plan now?
To transform two houses into one.
We break everything,
then incinerate it in the bakery furnace.
It's Christmas, so no one will
wonder why there's so much smoke.
What should I do?
Break anything you can get your hands on.
Whatever is evil
We shall burn to cinders
Whatever it is our hearts desire
We shall speak only of that
Whatever is undesirable
We shall turn to dust
Whatever it is that we need
We shall attain
The days gone by
Are gone forever
But will our memories of them ever cease?
To keep...
The troubled times at bay
The song of dawn stages a play
Shatter all your sorrows
And there will be bliss
No matter what happens
Everything will change for the better
Ronnie's wallet.
I guess he was searching
for it downstairs.
We'll burn this as well.
In this inexhaustible quest
And endless exploration
My passion persists
Thank you.
Just this one time, okay?
My body yearns endlessly
Show me the path to everything
That has ever eluded me
As dreams besiege my eyes
All questions vanish without a trace
I don't know what it's like to
kill someone in a sudden fit of anger.
But planning it so meticulously...
With, "I'm going to kill" running
in your head. And then to finally kill...
It's agonizing.
When you told me at the restaurant
that the guy had run away,
even though I thought my plan had flopped,
it was a relief in a way.
Jerome would live to see another day.
So I gave up and went to a movie.
There you were again.
And now Jerome is gone.
Killing someone in a fit of anger
and spending seven years in jail
obsessively thinking, "Why did I kill?
Why did I kill?"
That is also agonizing.
Shatter all your sorrows
And there will be bliss
Maria!
Eyewitness!
Not one, but two!
Undaunted by the crash of thunder
The fearless rainbow emerges
Love is the answer
Do not seek any answers
Do not halt, just live
Look at this photo.
Looks like one of those happy families
in a real estate ad.
Father, mother, two kids, and a dog.
But this is a real family.
I don't have the heart
to throw it in the fire.
I'll hand it over at the church.
Once all this is over
let's take a photo together.
I'm doing all this for Annie,
but what if something
goes wrong and I go to jail?
She is going to suffer
even more on her own.
My mom often said,
"God helps those who help themselves."
What about, "Thou shall not kill"?
"Sometimes violence
is better than sacrifice."
Sometimes.
This gentleman seems
to have grown bigger overnight.
Tell Annie that Santa gave this.
Choose one.
Good choice.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Maria.
So, to catch the man-eating tiger that
preyed on anyone who entered the forest...
police forces from all
over the world gathered there.
So first came...
Scotland Yard.
They used all their cunning...
to lay all kinds of traps.
But the tiger didn't
fall into any of them.
Next came the Chinese Police Force.
They used all their manpower.
They searched every nook and cranny...
with a fine-toothed comb.
But the tiger wasn't caught.
Finally,
our policemen showed up.
They went into the forest.
They were so confident
that people were skeptical.
In one hour,
the cops who went were back!
"We've captured the tiger!" they said.
"We will show the whole town tomorrow."
Everyone was stunned!
How on earth!
So many people have tried and failed.
How had they done it so easily?
The next day,
in front of a big covered cage,
a huge crowd gathered,
breathless with anticipation.
The policemen came.
They slowly unveiled the cage.
Everyone was shocked.
Inside, instead of a tiger,
there was a bear!
As everyone stared at the bear in shock...
a policeman brought a big stick
and began beating
the hell out of the bear.
He beat it black and blue.
The bear began shrieking...
"I'm the man-eating tiger!
I'm the man-eating tiger!"
The bear pleaded for mercy.
"Gotcha!" said the policeman.
{\an8}How was it?
{\an8}But madam, isn't that wrong?
{\an8}Madam, the postmortem report is here.
{\an8}According to the report, the bullet
pierced the right side of the chest,
{\an8}broke a rib, tore through the heart,
entered the lung...
Is it murder or suicide?
{\an8}The report says, "suicide."
{\an8}But since the blood seeped
into the sweater
{\an8}the exact time of death
cannot be determined.
What happened to the bottle
that was sent to the lab?
{\an8}The lab opens late,
so the report will only come tomorrow.
{\an8}What a waste of time.
{\an8}Leave the report
on the inspector's table.
{\an8}Okay, ma'am.
After taking such a beating,
if the bear admitted that it was a tiger,
then what does that mean?
It must have occurred to the bear
that whatever punishment
was to come after the confession
was preferable as opposed to
the pain of these beatings.
Because that beating...
was the mother of all beatings.
Pass me that idli parcel.
He's been repeating
the same story since last night.
That quack!
{\an8}A beating doesn't always
have to be a beating.
{\an8}It can even take the form
of two idlis with thick chutney.
{\an8}There's a man named Albert on
Fire Brigade Road. Bring him here.
Albert.
Albert.
Albert!
Albert.
Albert?
Albert!
Albert!
- Albert!
- Albert.
Albert?
They said it was urgent, Albert.
So I let them in with my spare key.
Are you Albert?
Come to the police station with us.
I hope there isn't a problem.
No, Uncle.
It's probably about my parole.
I called yesterday but
the inspector wasn't there.
Well, he's there now, so come.
- I'll just wash my face first.
- Make it quick.
Please sit down.
How was Yadhoom, Albert?
Superb, Uncle!
Totally worth it!
I prepared this myself.
It's very good.
Do you want to try it?
Make it quick, sir!
He's coming.
I didn't tell them about
the girl you brought home last night.
I know, I know!
My booze is a miracle worker.
Sir, when will you let Ronnie go?
- At least tell me that.
- Sit there.
The man may look shifty.
He is not capable of murder, sir!
He doesn't even know how to cut onions.
How can he possibly kill someone, ma'am?
We have two kids, sir.
Please consider, madam!
He's a nice guy. Trust me.
If he's a good guy,
what's there to be afraid of?
Look...
There's no problem at all.
We'll send him after
all the formalities are done.
Do one thing... go to the hotel,
and eat something.
Pack something for your husband as well.
Everything will be okay.
- Albert? Come.
- Get going!
Okay, ma'am.
Where do you work, Albert?
I called you here in
connection with a case.
Where were you last night?
What's that bruise on your face?
I fell, sir.
What case, sir?
Just answer the questions I ask.
I'll hand over the case
file for you to read later.
Sir, I arrived in town
only yesterday evening.
I was here after a long time.
So I got ready and went out.
Did you come from Dubai?
No, sir. From Nasik jail.
Nasik jail?
Please come.
The postmortem report has come.
{\an8}There's no problem there.
Looks like a suicide.
{\an8}Everything will get cleared now.
{\an8}Once the legal formalities are done,
{\an8}we'll hand over the body to you.
{\an8}But before that...
{\an8}could you recount the
events of last night clearly?
{\an8}I can close the FIR then.
{\an8}Jerome and I had planned
to take Annie out to dinner.
But he didn't show up.
So I took her by myself.
Then we both went to a movie.
And from there to the church.
Then we left for
the hospital from the church.
But on the way there,
she said she felt better...
- Tea?
- No, sir.
She felt better and wanted to go home.
She gave us directions to her house.
Once we reached there,
she invited us upstairs.
She offered us a drink.
We had one drink as a formality.
After a while,
she noticed that her watch was missing.
She wanted to go look
for it at the church.
Ronnie took her in his car.
On the way, they dropped me home.
I reached home,
had some wine, and fell asleep.
Then I was summoned to the station.
So I came.
I haven't even showered yet.
Okay, wait here. I'll be back.
I had been fasting since morning.
I got tired at church and fainted.
It was Ronnie who came to my aid.
{\an8}He dropped Annie
and me back home in his car.
{\an8}I offered him a drink as a formality.
Only then did I realize
that my watch was missing.
{\an8}I decided to go back to church for it.
{\an8}Ronnie took me there in his car.
{\an8}I got my watch.
{\an8}Then we went to his yacht party.
{\an8}And then we returned home.
{\an8}When we got there...
{\an8}Jerome was...
Je...
{\an8}Bring a glass of water.
{\an8}Sorry...
{\an8}I missed out one detail.
{\an8}When we left the church...
{\an8}a man named Albert
or Gilbert or something...
{\an8}came along to help us.
{\an8}Later, when we went back to get my watch
{\an8}he got off near his house.
{\an8}Since I was a little disoriented
{\an8}I didn't pay close attention.
Wait here, we'll be back.
What does the "Dubai return" have to say?
He's not "Dubai return."
He's a jailbird.
Don't get too excited.
The girl he loved
left him for another man.
He killed her.
Crime of passion. He was imprisoned.
He spent seven years in jail.
He was released yesterday
for good behavior.
The very day he is released
is he likely to commit another murder?
But for your satisfaction,
we can ask Inspector Kamdar
to keep an eye on him.
As he's his parole officer.
Don't you suspect Maria or Ronnie at all?
What do we do with suspicions alone?
We don't have a witness.
Everyone involved
is telling the same story.
Even if it is a murder, as you suspect,
it would've taken place during
the time gap when they were at church.
None of these three were
in the house during that time.
What if there was another
guy in the house in that gap?
Where's the evidence of that?
That child. She was the only one at home.
But she can't speak.
But if she speaks, the case is solved.
If pigs could fly...
Until then,
this is not a murder, but a suicide.
I told you to stay at home
with your family on Christmas Eve.
So many times
I told you not to go out.
Now see what has happened.
It was a big mistake, Scaru.
I'll never disobey you again.
- Promise?
- I promise, my Scarface!
I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
And thanks for all your help yesterday.
That's okay.
Albert.
This is my wife, Scarlet.
- This is Maria. And her daughter, Annie.
- Hello!
And that's Albert.
- Hello.
- I'm so sorry.
You had to face all
this trouble because of me.
No, no, please don't say sorry.
This isn't new for him,
he's always like this.
Our neighbor, the divorcee next door,
his secretary, our maid...
He socializes with all,
without distinctions.
They too keep buzzing around him,
calling him "brother."
They call him at all hours
for help when they're in trouble.
And he'll show up as the first responder.
As a result,
he ends up getting in trouble.
But he has never said no to anyone.
See,
even on Christmas day,
he chanced upon you in church.
Then, because you needed help,
he forgot all about home.
I'm used to this. No complaints!
He's a good man.
All the bad people are thriving.
It is good people
like him that are tested.
Wasn't Christ himself
tested beyond endurance?
Praise the Lord!
Enough, Scaru.
Why? I'm telling them the facts.
Poor thing.
You also look like a really good person.
In these tough times,
you will need a lot of support.
Don't hesitate to ask him for anything.
He will definitely help.
- Say yes and give your card.
- Okay.
No need. I have it.
He gave it to me last night. Thank you.
Did he give it? What a gem!
{\an8}Let's get statements from
all three and let them go.
Sir, Ronnie had mentioned
his missing wallet.
Ask him to write that down as well.
Or else, it will be blamed on us later.
What?
Sorry, sorry, sorry... one minute.
You lost your wallet again?
Oh, man!
He has made a habit out of this, madam.
How many times...
I asked you to sit in that corner.
Please go.
- Go!
- Dear...
- Please go.
- Okay.
Okay, okay.
Please go.
Every time he helps someone,
he loses his wallet!
What to do with him!
{\an8}Sir...
{\an8}Sorry, sir.
{\an8}I need to tell you something.
{\an8}I know where my wallet is, sir.
{\an8}Where is it?
{\an8}Before leaving her
house to go to church...
{\an8}I hid it inside the sofa.
{\an8}I thought it would be an
excuse to go back and get to know her.
{\an8}Nothing else.
{\an8}Moreover, I had been drinking.
{\an8}But there's one thing, sir.
{\an8}When we returned
and I saw her husband like that
{\an8}my conscience kicked in
and I tried to retrieve my wallet.
{\an8}I searched thoroughly, madam.
But it wasn't there!
Madam...
Did you happen to see the
missing wallet in your house?
{\an8}No, sir.
{\an8}If the wallet was there before
Jerome died, but it went missing after...
{\an8}Then, what if someone came
there during that time gap?
{\an8}Maybe they killed Jerome
for the money in the wallet
{\an8}and then ran away with the wallet?
{\an8}If someone else is involved in this
{\an8}then it's not a suicide.
{\an8}It's a murder.
{\an8}The most crucial piece
of evidence is that wallet.
Whoever has the wallet...
is the murderer.
Is anything else missing from your house?
{\an8}I'm not sure, sir.
{\an8}I have to go check.
{\an8}Never mind.
Now one thing is very clear.
A man has committed a murder
and has slyly escaped.
We have to get him for sure.
{\an8}Get the list of thieves known
for breaking and entering in this area.
{\an8}- Okay.
- Sir.
{\an8}I'm sorry for not
mentioning all this before.
{\an8}I was a little ashamed of what I'd done.
{\an8}But if coming clean helps you
solve the murder of an innocent man...
{\an8}then I don't mind being humiliated.
{\an8}Ronnie.
{\an8}You are a good Samaritan,
{\an8}but if you ever lose your wallet again...
{\an8}Ultimately, it has been
proven that your experience wins.
Once this case is closed,
I'm going to arrange a promotion for you.
But in this case...
it was Ronnie's overheated
loins that gave us our lead.
Madam, my wife...
Go on.
Annie.
Your release details aren't clear.
Give me your release form.
Sorry, sir.
I forgot my release form at home.
What?
You were released just yesterday.
Didn't you have the sense to bring
your release form to the police station?
Sorry, sir.
Come and hand over a
photocopy in the evening.
Okay, sir.
Please remember,
none of you can leave town.
You'll have to come here
whenever we call.
The case isn't closed yet.
In fact, it has just begun.
Is that understood?
You can leave.
- Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.
Sir, thank you so much.
- Once we find your purse, I'll inform you.
- Okay, sir.
Annie!
Didn't you have a bird in your hand?
Can't find it, Annie?
Cat's away, mice will play!
Birdie will find Annie today!
Let the birdie appear!
Abracadabra!
Is this your favorite toy?
Take it.
Did Mom give it to you?
Who gave it to you?
Santa.
