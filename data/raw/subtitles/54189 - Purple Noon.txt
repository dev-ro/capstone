There you go!
Two hundred miles
in 56 minutes. Not bad.
What a crate!
My head's bursting!
You had a great idea.
I don't know a soul here,
except Freddy.
We didn't hire a plane
to see him.
Hey, look.
Terrific.
Sign some more for me.
"l sign. l hereby sign.
And l countersign."
Marge will be sore.
We should have told her.
She wouldn't have let you go.
To keep her quiet, buy her
a book on Fra Angelico.
- She's writing one.
- Okay, then, let her copy it.
- Freddy!
- Hey, Phil! How are you?
Oh, the name slips me.
Miss... l don't know.
- How are you?
- Fine. Have a seat?
- Well, l don't like your pal.
- Too bad. He's a riot.
He can do anything,
even forge signatures.
Well, l think
he's just a bum.
Don't start that again.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hey, don't forget the book.
All right, l won't.
- Come on. Come on!
- Wait a second!
No. Rome's no fun without a girl.
Why didn't you bring Marge?
One ofTom's bright ideas.
Tom again.
You know, l didn't see him
for five years.
Guess what he's up to?
He's trying to get me home.
Dad is paying him
$5,000 to do it.
- No kidding?
- He'll pay on delivery.
- Five thousand dollars?
- We all died laughing.
Your dad is willing to pay...
to get you back
to San Francisco!
What else do you do
for a living?
Nothing.
What do you do?
Nothing.
But I've got my own dough.
He's got his.
I'll get mine.
Yeah, but he hangs onto his.
Stop fighting.
I have to go.
They're waiting for me.
- See you in Taormina next week.
- Right.
Hey, what did I just say?
"I have to go. See you
in Taormina next week."
- Bravo. Ciao.
- Ciao.
- So long... chum.
- So long, Freddy.
- (Freddy) Bye!
- Ciao!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Pay.
(Speaking Italian)
Eight hundred lire.
Keep the change.
- Thank you.
- Come on. Let's go.
You're right. Why not spend
someone else's dough?
Your dad's money really talks.
- Look, I invite you to Taormina.
- That's just a stall.
Give him 500 lire.
I'm broke.
I've no small change.
Here's 10,000 lire.
You can buy his cane
for that price!
Say, you've got
a pretty white cane.
Yes.
Ah, yes. Thanks.
Want to sell it to me?
Impossible, sir.
I am really blind.
He says he's blind.
I offer you 20,000 lire.
Sir, how will I be able
to go home?
To save cab fare,
he turns down 30 bucks.
Give him his fare too.
- I haven't any change.
- Your cab fare.
Plus 20,000 lire.
It's pretty.
Say, give me a laugh.
I'm poor, too, you know.
Yes. But you're not blind.
That's right. I can see $5,000
waiting for me in your dad's pocket.
Did you write
we were coming?
Of course!
Your love for Marge is blind.
Yes, but a blind man
runs no risks.
He never knows if he's in danger.
You dope!
Can't you watch out?
(Woman)
Taxi! Taxi!
You see, they can't hurt us.
It was a close shave.
- Hold this.
- Taxi?
- What are you doing?
- You'll laugh.
Just watch.
(Bumping, Yelping)
Oh, you're hurt.
Can I help you?
Where are you going?
Wait.
- We didn't eat for three days.
- Lady, we're starving.
- (Woman Laughing)
- What I'd do for a hot dog and beer.
- Or just caviar.
- Maybe she's broke.
- Are you, lady?
- Say, what are you doing?
Just trying to know how you look.
(Laughing)
(Together)
Proceed!
Cut it out.
She's mine.
(Speaking Italian)
- You're not blind?
- Why should I be?
You really fooled me.
My darling!
Lend me your cane.
I want to know what
it's like to be blind.
Can't be done.
We might sell it to you.
Oh, what thieves!
- How much?
- Thirty thousand lire.
Forty thousand!
What a pair of...
I'll give you 30,000.
- I'm no sucker!
- Thanks, sweetheart.
I really fell for it.
Let's stop.
Wait for me. Let me try
and see what it's like.
Drive around the circle.
&&(Piano)
Boris! Grow tall. Stretch up!
Breathe when you jump.
You worship this girl.
She's exquisite. You adore her.
Then drop your shoulders!
Here they are.
Look at them.
You're a sight for sore eyes.
All is vanity.
Nothing exists.
That includes ballet!
Please put him to bed.
Please put him anywhere.
Our angel is going to the devil.
And so is our ballet.
Ah, no, no, no.
No one gets married
before a premiere!
Take it easy.
We didn't do it.
We found him on the waterfront.
- We saved him.
- Go to Marge! She's waiting for you.
All right.
&&(Woman Vocalizing)
A souvenir of Rome.
I guess I'm supposed
to thank you.
- Thank you.
- We just had a drink in Rome.
Nothing wrong with that.
You missed O'Brien's wedding.
He got along without us.
Don't worry.
I won't miss ours.
The cover is a little soiled,
but the rest is clean.
Stop it!
You didn't even call me.
We're going to meet
Freddy in Taormina.
He sends you his love.
Stop brooding!
- Are you mad?
- What else can I say?
What's gotten into you?
Marge, my love.
& Love's sweet song &
Beat it!
Okay.
&& (Strikes Chord)
My Marge.
Marge, my love.
My little Margie
knows I love her,
and that I won't go with that
nasty Tom to San Francisco.
My love for Marge is blind.
Take off my clothes.
It was just a gag.
And my shoes too.
Don't you feel well?
I'll go get the mail.
Good idea.
Philippe!
A letter from your father.
Listen to this.
"Philippe shows no signs
of returning.
"Despite what you write,
he does not plan to come home.
"I am sorry, Tom,
but you have failed.
Sincerely yours."
Didn't you write him
we were coming?
No!
- Good morning, Gennero.
- Good morning, sir.
- How much this time?
- As usual.
- Fifteen hundred dollars?
- That's right.
618 per dollar.
- That makes 927,000 lire.
- That's correct.
(Muttering)
What if we just went
to San Francisco on a visit?
Wouldn't he give me my $5,000?
Sure, we'll go.
Thank you very much.
I'm through.
Washed up.
We'll blow this in Taormina.
The bill.
Hey, don't drag that trunk aboard!
I've got everything in it.
The small one will have to do.
Take this to my hotel.
Don't wear those shoes on my deck!
Here. Here.
- Be careful.
- We'll think of you.
Let's get going.
- Bye, Tom.
- See you soon.
(Indistinct)
Tie the small jib!
- Now make it fast!
- I don't know how.
Let me do it!
Do we have to stay long
in Taormina?
No, sir.
I've cabled your dad
that we're coming.
In Rome, you agreed.
Yes, sir.
(Bell Dinging)
Time to eat.
No, thank you.
This reminds me
of your 15th birthday.
What a boat ride that was!
Without you, I'd have drowned.
What a party!
I worshiped you.
His father couldn't stand me.
He thought I wasn't well-bred.
Funny that he should
send me here now.
He thought I had brains,
but not enough money.
If you're trying
to look well-bred,
which is a sign
of bad breeding,
don't use a knife to cut fish.
And don't hold
a knife like that.
Hold it this way.
I'm telling you
for your own good.
Can you hold a course?
I think so.
160 degrees south-southeast.
(Philippe)
We'll bring up your coffee.
You treat him terribly.
I want to see how far he'll go.
- You torture him.
- Save your tears.
All he thinks of is money.
Then why did you go
to Rome with him?
Philippe, don't you like
to be alone with me?
Sweetheart, you're crazy.
If you don't love me,
I'd rather go.
Go where?
Don't be a fool, darling.
He's the one who's going to go.
He's going ashore.
And right away. Happy?
Then we'll be alone,
just the two of us.
The way we used to be.
(Crash)
Are you nuts?
Give me a hand!
Jump! She'll scrape my hull!
We'll tow her.
I can't! I'm scared.
I'm scared of the water!
It's your fault! Jump!
Philippe! Philippe!
What are you doing?
Teaching you a lesson.
- Philippe!
- Just a taste of exile.
Philippe! Philippe!
(Rope Snapping)
Philippe! Philippe!
Marge!
The dinghy's gone.
(Marge)
Tom! Tom!
He's got a nasty sunburn.
You went pretty far.
What kind of a game is this?
Were you like that
when you were 15?
What a strange friendship.
He was no friend of mine.
He made it all up.
I hardly knew him.
It's all in his imagination.
Are you sure you're
not making a mistake?
Of course, I'm sure.
He's shivering. Go get
a sweater from his bag.
(Chuckling)
You know,
I don't want to hurt you,
but when we get to Taormina...
You'd like to see me go?
Yes.
I've never seen him
like this before.
Believe me,
it's best you go home.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry for you.
You love a man
who doesn't deserve you.
- Where's the sweater?
- He's too sick.
Just cover him up.
That'll do.
&& (Rinky-Dink Piano)
Feeling all right?
Fine, thanks.
It was only a joke,
but I went too far.
Oh, forget it.
It was all my fault.
I'm afraid of the water.
- It's my fault. How's the sunburn?
- Cooling off.
Ah, nine of spades.
By the way, didn't you feel like
killing me yesterday?
Not then,
but once or twice before.
Very interesting.
What did you say?
Nothing. We're joking.
That's why you took
my bank statements.
- Right.
- You kill me, and you're rich.
You've got it figured.
I don't think
much of the idea.
- You'll be caught.
- Maybe not.
I think I can get away with it.
Even in fantasy.
She's listening.
Say something! Say anything.
Eight of clubs
and an eight of hearts.
- A long journey.
- Ah, Taormina. Mount Etna.
- Philippe.
- We're taking a sentimental journey!
- Philippe.
- Yes.
- Philippe!
- Yes!
Come here.
I want your opinion.
- Listen.
- Listen to what?
My new preface.
"Fra Angelico was on the fence...
between Gothic
and Renaissance painting."
- I've read that somewhere.
- Wait.
Oh, skip it. We'll discuss it
some other time.
- You don't care about my work.
- Yes, I do.
- You don't love me.
- What's wrong now?
Why mix love and Fra Angelico?
My work doesn't interest you.
Yes, it does. But putting
Fra Angelico on a fence is not tactful.
Oh, excuse me.
Do you call this tactful?
What is that?
(Marge)
A souvenir of the Coliseum?
(Philippe)
I don't get it.
Don't start again.
I beg you.
Please don't spoil everything.
You know I love you.
- Now leave me alone!
- You don't respect my work!
- But you never work.
- At least I try. You call this work?
If you prefer, I can
work somewhere else.
Good idea!
- Stop it!
- Get out!
Go somewhere else!
No!
- Marge.
- No!
Marge.
What's going on?
- What's wrong, Marge?
- Put me ashore.
- What?
- Put me ashore! (Crying)
- She wants to go ashore.
- All right.
I don't understand.
Look, if you want me to leave...
Marge.
Marge.
Where will you go?
- I don't know.
- Back to Mongibello?
I might.
Marge?
Thanks.
I'm going back to Mongibello.
I can't treat her like that.
Now that we're alone,
let's continue our little chat.
- Gladly.
- So you kill me.
Then what?
First, I bury you.
Then I sign your letters of credit.
That won't be too easy.
- I can learn.
- Naturally.
- The earring. Your idea?
- No.
Come on, stop lying.
- All right, I give up.
- We'll settle that later.
You were talking like me
in front of that mirror.
Do it again.
I just said, "Marge.
"My little Margie, my love.
"That nasty Tom will
never separate us.
"I won't go home, and he
won't collect his $5,000.
I'll destroy anything
that comes between us."
Okay, I'll bet on one poker hand.
Your watch against $2,500.
My return would have
paid off double.
You mean,
we're never going back?
I love Marge.
- && (Watch Playing Tune)
- Let's go.
(Watch Chimes Striking)
One card.
- Well?
- Straight.
Oh! Two pairs.
I'll write you a check.
You cheated.
You wanted to lose.
You broke up three tens.
I'm not for sale.
$2,500.
That's a good price.
Not good enough.
Even $5,000 won't buy me now.
- I can get it all.
- How?
I know how.
Imitate my signature.
You try it.
It's not that easy,
but I told you, I can learn.
You could never write
a whole letter.
Yes, I could.
I have your typewriter.
Anyone can see it's yours.
What if I throw it overboard?
(Laughs)
That would be silly.
You won it.
(Screams)
Marge!
(Boat Thuds)
What a disgrace.
Marge?
Philippe?
Philippe.
Oh, I thought it was Phil.
Where is he?
- Philippe?
- Marge.
He's not here.
He doesn't want to see me.
Tom, I'm glad you're here.
Did he meet Freddy?
Is he in Rome?
Listen to me.
Why didn't he come back?
- Is he still angry?
- Yes.
Will he stay away very long?
Will he come back for his things?
Tell me the truth.
No, he isn't coming.
He sent you to do it.
You're not proud of
what he's asking you to do.
Well, I won't run after him.
Here's his bathrobe.
The rest is on the boat.
Miss.
Mail for Mr. Greenleaf.
- Thank you.
- Good day.
He trusts you with his boat.
He's never done that for anyone.
Just like him.
Takes his typewriter
and forgets his pajamas.
I'm going to change.
(Speaking Italian)
Marge?
I must see him about this letter.
He owes money on the boat.
I'm broke.
I'm in an awful spot.
I'm going back to Paris.
Be reasonable.
I'll show him the letter.
(Horn Honking)
(Bell Pealing)
Mr. Ripley!
Mr. Ripley, your passport.
So you want to sell your boat.
But you still owe us 500,000 lire.
And you also want an advance.
I'll have to talk to the manager.
Please sign this sale order.
I'm afraid it's late in the season.
I'll mail it to you.
Fine.
You're still at Mongibello?
No, I'm in Rome.
Hotel Excelsior.
Well, good-bye, Mr. Greenlaff.
- Greenleaf.
- Greenleaf. So sorry. Greenleaf.
(Bell Tolling)
I reserved a room by phone.
My name is Philippe Greenleaf.
Please write your address, sir.
If there are any calls, I'll be
in my room. Philippe Greenleaf.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, Marge?
Phil, where are you?
- In Rome.
- Where are you staying?
Write me at American Express.
- I had to hear
the sound of your voice.
- Let me come.
No!
Why are you running away from me?
It's best that we don't see
each other for a little while.
- Is she a brunette?
- Here we go again!
- The earring girl?
- If you start, I'll hang up!
I'll never see you again.
I hate you!
- I was unfaithful to you with Tom.
- What?
With Tom, I said!
- Anything else?
- Yes, the shipyard wants to be paid.
As for me, I'm leaving for Paris.
I won't let you.
I'm going back if I have to crawl.
- Did you see him?
- Yes, he gave me a letter for you.
What is he doing?
Whom does he see?
Is he happy?
I don't know.
I don't lead his life for him.
I only see him
once in a while.
Don't lie.
Marge.
You've changed too.
I don't understand this.
If you wrote to me,
would you type your letter?
Wouldn't you just
sign your first name?
He's still angry.
- Take it easy.
- It's so dull.
It's not like him.
You didn't get along very well.
But now he praises you.
Swear to me he's
not in San Francisco.
Come on, Marge.
I'm sorry.
You're my only link to Phil.
If you lost track of him,
what would I do?
Don't be foolish.
You must be fed up
with both of us.
Do you know Naples?
I'll show you the old quarter.
You'll like it.
Then we'll cash
the travelers' checks.
I'll go change.
- Coming with me?
- No, I'd rather wait.
I'll only be a minute.
Tom?
Let's have a drink.
Yes, in the old quarter.
I'll write Phil a note.
Will you give it to him?
Meanwhile, I'll go for a walk.
Mr. Greenleaf.
Mr. Greenleaf.
Good morning.
I have reserved 12 rooms.
You'll find your keys
at the desk.
Mr. Greenleaf?
(Speaking Italian)
Boris, did you hear?
Philippe is here!
- (Chime Ringing)
- (Man) Mr. Greenleaf?
Mr. Greenleaf? Mr. Greenleaf?
Telephone.
Boris?
Booth five, Mr. Greenleaf.
He's in room 423.
I'm going to call
and tell Marge.
- Mongibello 224, please.
- Yes, madame.
I've received your order
to sell the boat.
Naturally, you won't
use her anymore.
No, no, no.
- Hello?
- Yes, uh...
- Booth eight, madame.
- Thank you.
I am moving today.
I've rented an apartment
at 90 Via Savoia.
- Via Savoia.
- That's it. Good-bye, and thanks.
Good-bye, Mr. Greenleaf.
- (Doorbell Rings)
- Come in!
Here are your newspapers.
- You'll like it here. It's very quiet.
- I hope so.
I always say, new curtains...
make all the difference.
- (Woman Yelling)
- I'm coming!
Mamma mia. No one ever
leaves me in peace.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Very beautiful.
Can I move things around?
Just make yourself at home.
- This too?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Oh, there's a wire.
(Chuckles)
(Typewriter Tapping)
"Dear Marge. We may
as well call it quits.
I have hesitated
for a long time..."
- (Doorbell Rings)
- Come in.
(Ringing Continues)
What a pain.
Hello!
Oh, it's you.
Where's Phil?
- Out eating lunch.
- Where?
That little place near
the Piazza del Popolo.
Okay, I'm going.
Still on the move.
Is he coming or going?
- I don't know.
- How are things?
Not bad.
Say, how did you get my...
I mean, his address?
From the shipyard.
I've got a boat, too,
you know.
What are you doing here?
I just came to say hello.
Look at those paintings!
What taste!
I see you're wearing his shirt.
Yes. I didn't have
any clean laundry.
What about Phil and Marge?
- Are they busting up?
- Who told you that?
Oh, these things get around.
Did he really throw
her manuscript overboard?
(Laughs)
Philippe!
What a stink!
Phil is fantastic.
- Why has he gone into hiding?
- He's not hiding.
Oh, yes, he is.
It's understandable
to avoid Marge. But me?
He didn't even bother
to drop me a line.
- Look, I'm not Phil.
- I'm going to that restaurant.
He'd better be there.
You must be his ghost.
You write his letters.
- Why do you say that?
- I thought I heard someone typing.
By the way, Marge is in Rome,
at the Hotel Minerva.
- Any message for her?
- No.
Good-bye.
His shoes too.
Amazing.
Mr. Greenleaf!
Mr. Greenleaf!
Mr. Greenleaf!
- Is he Signor Greenleaf?
- Certainly.
I'll deliver it.
(Footsteps On Stairs)
Say, Tom.
You're quite a guy!
(Grunts)
Didn't you see the sign?
You're not allowed to park here.
Is that your car?
Move along.
Find another place.

- Very good.

- Yes?
Does Mr. Greenleaf
live here? Police.
- Has he lived here long?
- No, only two weeks.
Has he had many visitors?
- No, just one. Third floor.
- Which apartment?
Drive around the block.
I want you to pick up
two suitcases.
Over there.
Please hurry.
I want to withdraw
money from my account.
Over there, sir.
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.
- I want ten million lire.
- Ten million?
Your passport, please.
All right, Mr. Greenleaf.
We can do that.
Please sign here.
Just a moment.
You'll only have
$450 left in your account.
I know.
Your passport.
I'd like to call 86.27.17.
I'll get my mail
and be right back.

Hello, Philippe?
Hello, Philippe?
- Yes.
- Is that you, Philippe? It's Tom.
- Tom who?
- Ripley. Ripley!
Is Mr. Greenleaf there?
Giovanni, take this down.
Mr. Greenleaf just stepped out.
He'll be right back.
Could you drop in?
Sorry, I can't. I just got in.
Tell him to call me
at the Hotel Paradiso.
- Hotel what?
- Hotel Paradiso.
- Thank you.
- Thank you!
- (Knock At Door)
- Yes, come in.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I'm Inspector Riccordi.
Glad to meet you.
Please sit down.
- What can I do for you?
- Oh, well, we'll see.
I would like to ask you
a few questions.
- What's it all about?
- Did you see the newspapers?
- No, not yet.
- Freddy Miles has been murdered.
- Freddy?
- You knew him?
Yes, but not very well.
He was a friend of Philippe's.
Later I will tell you
what happened, Mr. Risley.
I can't believe it.
Is Philippe Greenleaf
a friend of yours?
Yes.
An old friend?
Yes, you might say so.
I knew him in San Francisco.
Then I saw him here.
Where is he?
I thought he was in Rome.
Have you seen him recently?
- No, I've been on a trip.
- Where to?
Oh, all over Italy.
Mainly the north.
I plan to do some traveling.
I must ask you to remain
in Rome, Mr. Risley.
Ripley.
Do you have your passport?
No, it's at the desk.
Were Miles and Greenleaf
on good terms?
Do you know more
about Freddy Miles?
No.
But Marge knew him
much better than I did.
- Who is Marge?
- A friend of Philippe's. His fiancee.
Tomorrow, we'll ask you
to identify the body.
Do you think Mr. Greenleaf
killed Mr. Miles?
What a wild idea!
- Do you recognize him?
- Yes.
- Oh, it's frightful.
- Did he have enemies?
Enemies? Of course not.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.
It's tragic.
I'll never get over it.
(Policeman)
I'm sorry Mr. Greenleaf isn't here.
- Any sign of him?
- No. What about you?
No.
Could he be hiding?
- Hiding from whom?
- Oh, I was just wondering.
He was seen leaving with Miles.
They were both high.
They could hardly stand up.
We dance, we slave,
but where will it get us?
We'll all end up like this.
(Speaking Italian)
(Horn Honks)
Be careful!
This is no time to get killed!
Sit down over there.
Spaghetti for everybody,
and a bottle of Rufino.
Two bottles.
- Marge...
- What a day he picked to disappear!
He's insane. What will
the police think of him?
- You mean Phil?
- Of course.
If he's innocent,
if he didn't kill anyone...
- Kill anyone?
- Those things happen.
I'm sure he's innocent.
You don't have to say it.
If you only knew
what this does to me.
I can't help it.
When I think of Philippe,
who may be out with a girl...
It's better to be
a lady-killer than a killer, no?
He doesn't even know
they suspect him. (Cries Out)
He'll turn up one day.
How do you know?
(Groaning)
- Marge?
- Yes?
You still love him.
In your letter, you said,
"I love you no matter what happens."
- What letter?
- The one I got...
...yesterday morning.
You mean the one I wrote to Phil?
- Marge?
- Yes?
I... I saw him,
but I swore I'd say nothing.
So he gave you my letter.
Yes. So that you
couldn't be involved.
- Why didn't he destroy it?
- He just couldn't.
Not so loud.
Forgive me.
I couldn't help reading it.
Here it is.
Poor Freddy!
When I read his horoscope,
I knew right away he would
die a violent death.
(Boris)
But he never believed it.
He was always smiling.
(Woman)
And Philippe liked him so much.
Poor Philippe.
I'm so worried about him.
Marge, I know where Philippe is.
He can't stay in Rome.
- He's hiding.
- Where is he?
He took a train
to Mongibello this morning.
All this excitement
makes me hungry.
Oh, thank you!
(Woman On P.A.
Announcing Departures)
"Dear Mother.
I cannot go on living.
"Forgive me.
I leave everything to Marge.
Your loving son,
Philippe Greenleaf."
"For Marge."
(Man, Shouting)
Philippe!
Philippe!
Philippe!
Old friend!
Hey, wake up!
(Laughing, Shouting)
Hey, Phil! Open up!
Sorry, but I've got to work!
Work?
You never did
a day's work in your life!
- Open the door!
- No!
Then I'll bust it open!
O'Brien, don't be an imbecile!
(Speaking English)
God is within!
Your genius is within!
(Laughing)
Excuse me, Miss. Police.
Please.
(Clatter)
"Police Still Hunt
Philippe Greenleaf'
- (Knock At Door)
- Come in.
Who is it?
May I come in?
It's not nice to tell lies.
You didn't tell me
you saw Philippe Greenleaf.
I didn't lie.
You knew we were
looking for him...
and that he is
in Mongibello.
I could arrest you
for withholding information.
You're lucky I'm a good guy.
- May I have a glass of water?
- Of course.
(Glass Clinking)
Strange, how I keep
coming back here.
It must be my instinct.
What do you mean?
My nose.
We're like bloodhounds.
- You said you were touring Italy.
- Yes.
The lakes, Turin, Milan,
Pisa, Florence?
- That's right.
- We found no trace of you
in any hotel.
I slept in my car.
It's cheaper.
We know Greenleaf killed Miles.
The fingerprints
we found in Miles'car...
match the fingerprints
in Greenleaf's apartment.
We almost got him
last night at Mongibello.
He vanished, and left a will.
He's killed himself,
or else he's putting on an act.
I don't know the answer yet.
Can I leave Rome now?
I don't mind,
as long as you stay in Italy.
I have no objections.
Bon voyage.
(Door Closes)
- Good morning, Mr. Ripley.
- Good morning, Raffaello.
Take these to the Miramar, eh?
- Here.
- Thanks, sir.

In other words,
you didn't make a cent.
Boris was sublime!
But the audience
sat on their hands.
With $10,000,
we can start all over.
I've already given you $30,000.
Oh, not that much.
Let's say $27,000.
- Let me congratulate you.
- How are things?
- Not bad.
- Sit down.
What brings you here again?
Mongibello is on my way
to southern Italy.
So I decided to say
hello to Marge.
- She never goes out.
- What do you mean?
We haven't seen her for days.
She won't see anyone.
I think she'll never get over it.
Do you know Phil
left her all his money?
- You mean it?
- He was so strange.
He treated her terribly.
Then he left her everything.
I guess he felt guilty.
His parents were shocked.
You can't take a girl
away from her family...
and then ruin her life.
The old man is coming.
- What old man?
- Phil's father.
He wants to see Marge
and straighten things out.
Yes.
So I can't see her?
I doubt it.
Thanks. I won't take
any more of your time.
Good-bye.
No, no. Don't get up.
(Imitating Philippe)
My darling. My love.
- (Gasps)
- Oh, Marge!
(Swinging Door Banging)
(Banging)
(Banging Continues)
It's thoughtful of you
to go into mourning...
for Freddy.
Phil wouldn't have
killed himself...
if I had been in Rome.
Stop fooling yourself.
It was you who kept me
away from him.
Philippe didn't love you.
It's not true!
His will proves it.
That's no proof.
Marge...
You know I'm right.
Why didn't he marry you?
I don't know how...
I don't know
how to tell you this.
I'm so clumsy.
I'm going back to the States.
I came to say good-bye.
Tom!
Don't go.
Play.
Play.
For me.
&& (Humming)
(Knocking)
Is anyone home?
- Who is it?
- (English) Is Miss Marge in?
She's at the beach.
- Good day.
- How do you do?
- Good day.
- Good day.
This is Mr. Lee.
He wants to buy the boat.
Miss!
Miss, your appointment.
Mr. Greenleaf is here.
I forgot all about the time!
- What?
- Mr. Greenleaf is here.
He's waiting for me.
It's awful.
What brings him here?
The sale of the boat.
I must be there too.
- Want to come?
- No, I'd rather wait.
I'm sure he'll want to see you.
You know,
he's a very fine man.
He wrote me,
"I can assure you,
"that we have no intention...
of contesting my son's will."
- I'll wait for you.
- I won't be long.
- Waiter!
- Yes, sir!
- Don't you feel well?
- What?
- Don't you feel well?
- That sun is really hot.
But I never felt better in my life.
- I want a drink.
- What will it be?
The best you have.
The best.
The best. The best.
(Winch Motor Droning)
Let's look over the boat.
It's really a wonderful buy.
It's just a formality.
I'm sure the hull is perfect.
You see, she needs no work at all.
(Marge Screaming)
(Man)
Madame.
(Speaking Italian)
- What is it? Yes.
- Do you know him?
- Call him to the phone.
- Why?
- I told you to call him.
- What telephone?
- Hurry up.
- What's he done?
- Hurry.
- Mister Ripley!
Mister Ripley!
Telephone!
