- Do you know what this is?
- Uh...
It’s a toothbrush holder.
Right. Yeah.
You could just get a regular cup.
Yeah.
I want something a little more...
- Uh...
- Many choices.
- Look.
- It’s a little big for a toothbrush,
but it might work.
I don’t know. I’m thinking
of getting some dental work done.
Jesus.
1.99 per pound.
Pound. Make sure
you hit the "D" on the end of pound.
"Where she buy some coffee."
God. Can you believe
these are still in bloom?
Oh! Those are nice.
I can put these on your table if you like.
I don’t care. It’s up to you.
So, uh, how’s it going?
Good. I’m just kind of tired.
It’s only 11, Preston.
Are you enjoying it at least?
- Yeah. I like it a lot, actually.
- Oh, good.
Are you going to go to the Ashford’s
tonight? Just for old time's sake?
Uh... I’m good.
Can a mother still kiss her son?
It’s so fun having you here.
I’m very proud of you.
Everyone likes you.
- Yeah, well, they kind of have to.
- No. That’s not true.
- Never mind. I guess it’s true...
- All right.
Hi, there. I’m Sandy, if you need anything.
- That’s great, isn’t it?
- Well...
Is this a real lobster trap?
No. No. But trust me,
you wouldn’t want it if it was.
Makes a nice decorative
accent though, don’t you think?
I’m looking for things
to put on my shelves.
Oh! You have a new place?
Yeah.
Starting over.
- Taking the day off work, I guess?
- Oh, no. No...
Actually, I’m retired.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I think it’s out.
No, it’s good. I think it’s...
I don’t know what’s wrong with me.
This never happens to me.
I mean, this is not your fault.
I didn’t think that it was my fault.
Good. Because it’s not.
Right. I know.
Anders?
You came. A surprise.
Yeah. Thanks for inviting me.
Of course. Why don’t you grab yourself
a drink in the other room?
Wes.
I heard you got out of finance.
I’m jealous.
Well...
Quit your job, Wes.
That’s all you gotta do.
You make it sound so easy.
I mean...
You’re a relatively young guy.
Why get out so early?
- Do you really want to know?
- Sure.
Let me have it.
Well...
It’s a system of monstrous greed,
and that’s the business.
Save yourself.
Do over the other guy.
And don’t worry about the consequences.
And for what?
More toys? Bigger houses?
Trip to the goddamn Caribbean?
Fake titties? No, thank you.
So, you have some big plans?
Yeah, I’m doing, uh...
I'm doing a little decorating
at the moment. You know, condo living.
- You enjoying that?
- Not at all. Would you?
I wouldn’t retire.
Well, I also got some, you know,
charity work going on.
- Oh? Which one?
- Yeah.
Uh... Disease. Diseases.
You know, in the cancer spectrum.
What the hell is he doing here?
I just saw him ear raping Wes Thompson.
Well, just...
The one time he doesn’t have to be here,
in fact shouldn’t be here, and here he is.
I shouldn’t have sent him the invite.
He was on the list.
I wasn’t paying attention.
It’s okay. It's just... He makes me sad.
You look really pretty, by the way.
You’re having sex.
Yes. That is true.
Just... not as good as with Anders?
Well, you know...
Why do we do this every year?
Our fucking kids don’t even come.
Kat’s not even coming for Christmas.
Are you kid... That’s awful.
Why didn’t Preston come?
You know, Preston had other plans.
Whatever that means.
- Oh God, I hate these fucking Spanx.
- Mmm.
Hello.
Shh...
- Hey.
- Yo. What’s up?
- What are you guys smoking?
- What?
You don’t have to worry.
I’m not gonna tell anyone.
You’re gonna be doing it anyway, right?
If you’re one of my dad’s friends that he
sent out here to narc on us or whatever,
you can go back in and tell him
that he’s very sad and predictable.
Okay, Charlie.
Who is that?
- Anders.
- Oh, Christ...
And I’m not one of your dad’s friends.
Wait, dude, come back for a sec.
Come here.
What do you mean you’re not friends?
Well, I’m not.
I mean my wife is. Well, my ex-wife.
Personally, I can’t, uh...
I can't stand your parents.
I find them unbearable.
Really? After all those summers
and shitty dinners
and blah blah blah?
I walked away from all that.
So I’ve heard.
So, why are you here?
That’s a really fucking good question.
You know how to rip one of these?
I don’t even know what that is.
This... is resourceful.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Sure, why not? Fuck it.
There you go.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Damn.
Yeah, the smell of your dad’s cigar...
makes me wish I was born without a face.
How you feeling?
Oh, wow. Oh, yeah...
Oh. I feel joyful.
Oh. So joy... Wow.
And sad, too... Jesus.
This is some serious grass.
Nah. That’s the PCP.
Yeah.
What, are you joking? I just smoked PCP?
We don’t technically know what it is.
- It’s like more of a blend.
- Yeah!
We feel joyful.
So joyful.
- And sad.
- Very sad.
I should get back to the party.
All right. Knock yourself out. Have fun.
Be careful, man.
Oh. What’re you doing out here, buddy?
Oh, just getting some air.
You’ve had a big year, huh?
- Surprised to see you here.
- Yeah. Thank you.
- I'm still looking for my son.
- Yeah.
Disappeared earlier,
which is cause for worry.
He was supposed to be
in his room studying,
as he failed three
of his exams at his boarding school.
I’m so fucking sick of warning him.
Who am I talking to?
- You know better than anyone.
- Yeah.
No, seriously, with Preston,
you guys, you did a program, right?
Huh?
You drag him off into the woods
or something?
Or something. Yeah.
Excuse me.
- I don’t get it.
- Look who it is.
- I don’t get it.
- Okay. Let’s come over here for a minute.
So... are you seeing that guy now?
Yeah. For a few months, yeah.
And is he gonna live here now?
Uh, well, he’s looking for a place.
He’s, uh, trying to get out of the city.
He’s going to commute for a while.
And what... you guys have been sleeping
together for a couple of years now?
Please don’t.
What, have we been divorced
for, like, six months?
Honey, why are you at this party?
I was invited.
Everyone’s invited.
- Do you think this is funny?
- No, I don’t...
That is funny.
What is wrong with you, Anders?
You are the one
who said you needed space.
Well, it’s not my job anymore.
I don’t have to babysit you.
I don’t have to make sure
that you don’t embarrass yourself.
You are the one who wanted out.
So, for God fucking sake, get out.
We need an ambulance!
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- Oh, my God!
Fucking angel dust?
I heard they got him hooked up
to a bunch of tubes and machines.
Mom said Sophie is a complete wreck.
I’m sure she is.
Apparently, the Ashfords are suing now.
Who in God’s name are they gonna sue?
Uh, the school, I guess. I mean,
they think that’s where he got the drugs.
Wait, wait.
They move their kid
to a different school because of drug use,
and now they’re blaming
his current drug use
on the school that they shipped him to?
Don’t act like you don’t understand it.
You guys did the same thing to me.
I didn’t sue anybody.
And you went to rehab.
Not boarding school.
- Well, I feel bad for the kid.
- So do I.
Hey, I heard you saw Mom.
- And met her new boyfriend?
- Yeah. I already knew him.
- You did?
- Mm-hmm. Not well.
We came up together as traders.
Just tell me he’s not living at the house.
Well, it’s Mom’s house. So...
He’s living at the house?
Dad, it’s not your house anymore.
- Well, it's certainly not theirs.
- What does that mean?
Isn’t it Mom’s?
Well, it was going to be. Yeah...
but in a fit of generosity and stupidity,
I told her she could have it.
But I can’t afford to retire
and pay for the mortgage.
Jesus.
- Don’t tell your mother, okay?
- You know, Mom’s gonna freak.
Where the fuck am I gonna live?
You living there is meant to be temporary.
She should downsize anyway.
- Hell, let Donny pay for it.
- Well...
I guess he probably can.
He seems pretty loaded.
Well...
I don’t know, Dad. I mean, it looks like
a bunch of little kids live here.
Eh. Look at it. It’s nice. It’s festive.
It’s like your own sad
little Christmas parade.
All right. Gotta go.
Wow, do you think this is a bit much?
Thanks so much. Of course, I will.
Oh, you know it.
He’s going as soon as he’s out.
We’ve found a good place.
Yes. I will. Thanks again.
Oh, honey, you’re so nice.
I'm not really that nice.
I just couldn’t imagine
who I’d run into at the market.
Well, you would have run
into Aunt Marilyn Erickson...
- Oof.
- ...and Leslie Abrams. Separately.
You’re my savior.
- Thank you.
- Yes, you’re welcome.
How long do you think
Preston’s gonna stay with you?
Jesus. There’s a part of me,
the sick part,
kinda likes having him around.
Every once in a while I forget
and I go to, like,
move something out of his face,
and he... One of these things.
It’s like, "Oh. Oh, right, you’re a man."
What did we do wrong?
Maybe I babied him too much.
Perhaps we’ve done everything wrong.
When are we gonna know
if our kids are broken?
Gee, let’s see. What time is it?
Tell me about your week. The holidays.
Uh... I got the condo decorated.
Uh... Preston helped.
- That must have been nice.
- And I, uh, went to a party.
I don’t know why I went.
Yeah, I do. I went to see Helene. Uh...
Was an awful night. I, uh...
I ended up getting very loaded.
It did not go well.
- You got loaded?
- Yeah. I did a stupid thing.
I got high with a bunch of kids
and then one of them ended up in the ER.
- You got high with the kids?
- Stupid.
At this point, Anders,
I should tell you. I was...
I was at the Ashford’s party.
Hmm?
I'm... I don't... I'm not... Sorry.
Kathleen and Sophie Ashford
are quite close.
Oh, well, I didn’t see you there.
So, uh...
So, okay, so you know what happened
to Charlie.
And, um... Uh, Jesus...
Way to bury the lead, Howard. Okay.
Uh... Well, I’m sure that you know...
I’m sure Charlie’s gonna be all right.
I mean...
Kids smoke dope,
and it’s not a big deal.
Do you know what drugs he was doing?
It was some kind of high school...
boarding school,
kind of hybrid blend kind of thing.
- Maybe PCP.
- PCP?
Look, he hands me this thing,
crazy little device,
I thought it was grass,
and yeah, it was stupid, but I mean...
You know, come on, Howard,
the kid would have been smoking it anyway.
I’m really sorry.
This is urgent. Please excuse me. Hello.
Fuck it.
- Charlie?
- One sec.
- Uh, my parents aren’t here.
- Is my wife here?
I don’t see her.
- Uh, how are you feeling?
- Awesome.
Because you look okay.
The way people were talking,
I thought maybe you were...
Do you have like a balloon for me
or something?
Yeah. In fact,
I thought you might like this.
That’s pretty sweet.
What the fuck is this?
Did you lift this?
- No.
- You brought me a, uh...
an erotic, stolen library book?
Okay, I’ll take it.
Hell no, it’s the best present
of all time. I love it!
Okay. Um...
If you need anything, I’ve moved,
so the number is on the back.
What happened to you?
You quit your fancy job?
Oh... Well, it’s complicated.
But yeah. I couldn’t go on doing
what I was doing to make a living
- and still feel good about myself.
- I can totally respect that.
And it was complicated.
There were a lot
of other things tied into it.
Like my wife and the endless commuting
and just a lot of things.
I couldn’t take it, so, uh...
Yeah... something had to change.
I have to go to rehab now
because my parents are Nazi assholes.
They’re worried about you.
They’re embarrassed. There’s a difference.
Well, you did a stupid thing.
Seriously? I’m getting a lecture from you?
You were high as balls.
I was tricked into that.
And, yeah, I’m sorry.
- "Guys, I’m joyful. I feel joyful."
- Hey, hey, hey...
I need you to, uh...
I need you to keep that between us.
Don’t worry, I’m not gonna tell anyone.
It’s not my style.
Hey, is that, uh... is that Laika?
Your drawing?
It is. Do you know what the, uh,
the scientist in charge of that project
said 40 years later? He said...
"Nothing that we learned on that mission
could possibly justify the loss
of that beautiful animal."
She was a stray. He was the one
that found her in the first place.
That’s heartbreaking.
I know there’s already
a million books about her.
Mine’s gonna have a different end.
- Oh, yeah?
- So they said
that she crashed into the ocean and died,
but she didn’t.
She just burned alive in the atmosphere.
So, in my version,
she’s supposed to still be out there.
So Oleg, that’s the scientist guy,
is, like, old and poor,
and one day he turns on some
of the old equipment,
and he hears her heartbeat,
like she’s still out there.
- What happens then?
- That’s as far as I’ve gotten.
- Anders.
- He just brought me a book. That's it.
Well, that was... sweet.
I really admire him as an artist.
- I really like his graphic novel.
- Yeah. So do I.
- You don’t even know what it is.
- It’s about a dog.
A stray dog, launched into space
for reasons she can never understand.
It’s about being exploited
by the people who are supposed
to be protecting you.
The Meadows isn’t outer space, honey.
It’s worse. It’s Arizona.
You see what I have to deal with?
I’m sorry, he needs to rest.
- He’s here looking for his wife.
- Uh, no. Not, not true.
I think she’s at home.
With her new boyfriend?
A lot of conversations
between my mom and your ex.
You know, about whether things
are moving too fast.
- A lot of yackety-yack.
- You made your point.
- Feel better.
- Mm-hmm.
I know you’re not gonna pick up.
But I want some photo albums.
And I want, uh, some home movies,
because I have none here.
Just a couple. Okay?
I was full of bravado. I said,
"Yeah, sure. You want the house, keep it.
Is that all you want?"
I don’t know what the fuck I was thinking.
You were thinking...
you were done with the marriage,
so you were done with the house.
I get that.
So, I haven’t paid the mortgage
in six months.
- So, what do you need?
- I’m gonna pay you back.
- Every penny.
- I am not worried.
You know...
I used to have this vision of my life.
It was like a web.
And these threads
that connected me, you know.
Yeah.
And the more webs
you could have coming from you,
then the more important you were. Right?
Like, if you were a doctor
you’d cure a bunch of...
- Patients.
- ...patients.
And... or a teacher.
You got a million threads, you know.
And you would be, basically,
irreplaceable, right?
'Cause so many people
depended on you, right?
- You understand what I’m saying?
- Yeah, it's...
- webs and...
- Yeah, but it’s really not the case.
- Come on, man.
- No, it’s the web.
The web is remaking itself.
Revising itself every second of every day.
And so if you vanish,
then the people that were in your life,
they learn to rely on someone else,
you know, and you’re gone.
And then the web just remakes itself
and moves on without you.
- But you got out of the web.
- No, no, no.
No. This whole town, it’s a life of work,
and commuting and bullshit.
- Yeah.
- You know what I’m saying?
And that was one web
I was happy to get out of.
Just drink up.
Come on. Come on, man.
I think you need to see something.
How’s Preston? He’s still at Northwestern?
Graduated. Living with Helene.
Oh, Jesus. What was the point?
Miss that?
I’m taking this Asian fusion
cooking class.
Total blast.
I never would have thought
cooking is so relaxing.
You know, I just put on some music,
sip some wine, a few hours go by,
end up with a delicious meal.
I generally eat it alone,
but it’s delicious. Delicious!
Larry, it's... Don’t you think
it’s a little tragic?
Fuck you, man.
Only if you look at it that way.
- It’s how you see it. It's how you see it.
- Hi, guys.
- How about a dance?
- No, thank you.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah, no offense.
Come on.
- He’s newly divorced, so...
- Oh!
- Then you need a little extra TLC.
- You’re probably right, but uh...
- I’ll take the dance.
- Okay. You got it.
You okay, dude?
Hey, could you, uh,
wet a paper towel for me, please?
Am I in the men’s room?
Thank you.
You okay?
I haven’t thrown up in a club
since I was 22.
- I wouldn’t drink that if I were you.
- It's disgusting.
Oh. Yeah. Right.
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?
No, why are you here?
I was stupid enough
to come here on a date.
Oh, my God...
Yeah, I’m hip. I can go to a strip club.
Three vodkas in, he’s trying to buy me
a fucking lap dance.
Is it hip for a woman
to go to a strip club?
I don’t know.
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I didn’t want to come here, either.
Yeah, right.
Hey, man,
I think your friend went upstairs.
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Thank you.
42 Maple Street, please.
And 112 Fisherman’s Lane.
I don’t have enough money.
Don’t worry about it. I got it.
Thank you.
Beautiful house.
Why are we here?
112 Fisherman’s Lane.
That’s what you said.
Well...
- Uh... Here. Take care.
- Oh. Thank you.
What the hell is all this shit?
Who the fuck is in my house?
Jesus Christ, Anders!
- I almost took your fucking head off.
- What are you doing here?
You know what? I’m just getting some
things of mine. Everyone needs to relax.
This is a weird flavor.
- Are you kidding me?
- Nope. Tastes like... flowers.
You can’t just come in here!
I’m getting some things
that are rightfully mine.
- No, you’re drunk.
- Some of this stuff...
I have a right to have it in my house.
I left a whole box of stuff for you,
over here by the door.
- Then what’s all this?
- I gave you half!
Oh. Okay. Sorry.
You care so much about family pictures,
you need to break in here
in the middle of the night.
- What's wrong with you?
- Well, I am a little dizzy.
- Why don’t you take a seat?
- Don’t tell me what to do.
I’m gonna sit down anyway.
Why don’t you give me those keys?
Donny, don’t do this now.
We can’t have this happen again. Come on.
You’re not going to do this again,
right, Dad?
You know what?
You never know.
Preston, can you drive
your father home, please?
You got it.
So, she hired you.
'Cause I thought it was all volunteers.
Yeah, most of them are,
but she worked it out so I could get paid.
Takes a lot of patience.
- You like it?
- Yeah. The pay is shit, but...
But you’re saving for your own place?
It’s not that bad. I gotta go.
- Where?
- Work.
Oh.
Hey, Preston. Come back here.
What does she see in him?
I don’t know. I mean...
- They seem kind of happy.
- Bullshit.
You know, you left her.
Right? You remember that?
You’re mad at me about that.
No, I’m totally thrilled you just kicked
Mom to the curb after all this time.
I’m gonna apologize to her
about last night, but...
I worry about you.
- You’re worried about me?
- Yeah. I can be an idiot
and I can still worry about you.
Okay, now, Christmas Eve,
why don’t you come over?
We’ll hang out. You can stay over,
we’ll watch some videos, or...
Mom’s planning the usual dinner.
Like she does every year, so I’m sorry.
But she’s already
making a big deal out of it.
Yeah, don’t worry about it. It’s nothing.
Okay, go teach someone how to read.
- All right, I will.
- Cool.
So, uh, Mr. Baptiste,
I understand there has been a dispute
with your tutor.
It’s not a dispute.
If you would explain everything to me.
- He stole from me.
- He stole from you? How?
Your son told me about an opportunity
to make money.
An opportunity?
What kind of an opportunity?
Some gambling business.
How he’s going to double my money.
Where’s my money?
I don’t see it.
I need this money.
Hey, I’m, uh...
I'm Anders. I’m your neighbor.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, look... Look, hold on. Hold on.
No, no, no, you’re missing the best part.
Come in.
Hey.
Okay...
I was drunk. Uh, it was a stupid,
obviously ridiculous thing to do.
- I’m sorry.
- Terrific, Anders.
At the moment,
I need to find our moron of a son
who fucked up the only job he could get
because his mother gave it to him.
Where is he?
I have an idea.
How could he do this to me? To himself?
Hold on, do what?
He took money from a client
and gambled with it.
Hi. Is there a, uh, poker game
going on here somewhere?
- Excuse me.
- I’m not causing trouble.
I’m just, uh, looking for my son.
Through the kitchen.
This is very impressive.
Did you guys have me followed?
Wow, Preston. Really?
I had a very
interesting conversation today.
I didn’t take that guy's money.
$2,000 from an illiterate man.
I thought we weren’t supposed
to use that word.
Don’t be an asshole, Preston.
Look, I’m going to win it back. Okay?
Look at you two, a real team.
- Do you want to tell me what happened?
- Yeah, he gave me the money.
- For you to gamble with?
- The guy...
he had a broken truck and he was thinking
about asking some sketchy dude
in the neighborhood for a loan, okay?
I told him how these things work,
how he’d get himself curb-stomped
if he’s not careful.
So he asked if I knew of anything else...
And you thought, "Oh, that’s right,
there’s that underground poker game
that I’m involved with."
Okay. Let’s just get this over with.
- Get what over with?
- The firing. The sacking. Come on.
- I get it.
- You have to understand, Preston,
even if you meant well, it’s gonna look
really bad if I don’t fire you.
You don’t have to explain it.
You’re fired.
- And you have a week to move out.
- All right.
Oh, uh, but you should probably
look for a place to live, too.
Me? What is that supposed to mean?
Well, 'cause
Dad’s not paying the mortgage.
- He hasn’t in six months.
- So...
You’re still fired.
And you’re still moving out.
- Look...
- Just tell me that that’s not true.
I’m getting it sorted...
You had to be a big man, right?
"Go ahead. Keep the house."
I was attempting to be... generous.
The only problem, Anders, is to be
a big man, you have to be a big man.
I made so much money for everybody!
Everybody! For years!
So I could lose the house. To foreclosure.
Why do you even want it?
It's a five-bedroom house.
Look, I may decide to move.
But if I decide to move,
I prefer that it’s my choice.
Well, you don’t have to worry
'cause I’m getting the money.
Really? And how?
A loan. From Larry Eichner.
That house is our history.
It’s my history.
I made that garden from nothing.
- And that means something.
- I know.
I know it means something.
But do you really?
Do you know what anything means?
I thought I did.
You’re supposed to be happy now, Anders.
That’s why we got divorced, right?
'Cause we were all in the way
of your happiness.
The house, your career, me.
The way of life.
- You remember all that?
- Yeah.
- I’m the lady who...
- I recognize you.
- We shared a cab.
- Feeling better?
Yeah, thank you.
Listen, that cab was a fortune.
- Let me pay you back.
- Oh, God, no.
- Oh, no, I insist.
- No, come on.
Can I buy you lunch or something?
Okay, don’t worry about it. I just...
I just wanted you to know
I appreciated it.
You really saved me. And I thank you.
You know what? Yeah.
Yeah, buy me lunch.
A very, very expensive lunch.
Okay.
Would you please put your number in there?
All I ask. Please don’t fucking text me.
I’ll text you soon. Yeah?
- Hey.
- Okay...
- Is this a bad time?
- Uh, no. Were you waiting for me?
- No. Just drove up.
- Okay. I just got home. Uh...
- Yeah, come in.
- Great.
Wow!
This is a nice place.
Oh. Thank you. Well, it’s not,
not as nice as yours, but...
Uh, how about a beer?
No. Definitely not.
Listen. I’d like to apologize.
- You?
- Yeah. Yeah.
For everything that’s happened. I should
have called you in the first place.
I mean, we were friends.
Well...
Yeah...
Well, we were acquaintances.
And it’s awkward.
- Hmm.
- So...
I want to be completely up front with you.
Full disclosure.
The older I’ve gotten,
the more I’ve realized
that it’s all about communication.
What’s all about communication?
Relationships. People.
Yeah.
- I was an idiot the other night.
- And I am sorry about the golf club.
You know, you hear somebody
in your house at that hour, well...
How is my house?
This is what I want to talk to you about.
I can give you ten percent
over market value.
Excuse me.
I’m making you an offer.
Well, the house isn’t for sale.
It means a great deal to Helene.
I can pay you today, right now.
Yeah. Not interested.
For a guy who worked at finance
for so long, I’m a little surprised.
Look, you’ve got to admit,
this situation doesn’t make sense
to anyone now.
How old are you?
Same as you, why?
Hmm. It just seems to me
to be a strange time
to suddenly decide
you’re gonna have a family.
Anders, this crap has to stop.
What’s with that? The ribbon.
My sister. It’s in honor of her.
She died from breast cancer.
Oh, I’m sorry.
Hey... Um...
I’d like to make a donation.
- Anders, come on. Please.
- "Please" what? I’d like to donate.
Are you going to make me beg?
Take it.
Bye.
Right on time.
- The parking out there. It's just...
- Oh, I know.
It’s Christmas shoppers.
- Yeah, right.
- Can I get you anything?
- I’ll have a Merlot.
- I’ll have a Corona.
Thank you.
Do you have kids?
Yeah. Yeah, I do. I have a boy.
A man, I mean. Uh... You?
I have women. Two women. Here they are.
There’s Rachel and there’s Carmen.
Oh.
And now this is gonna
probably end in one minute,
because I just showed you pictures
of my kids.
They seem nice.
I actually always wanted a son
because boys are so much easier.
I don’t know.
- Easier than girls?
- Girls are... oh!
The mind-games and the lying,
and when they’re teenagers...
The drinking. And they were so mean to me.
- All the time.
- And now?
And now… they’re much more human.
- I wish I could say the same.
- Oh, sorry.
He’s just kind of lost. You know.
And angry. And generally rude. Immature.
A little bit like the guy you see
sitting across from you right now.
Oh. Lucky me.
- He’s also very sweet and, uh...
- Here you are.
He’s a good person.
- Like you?
- Well, the jury’s out.
- But I try.
- Well, that’s all you can do.
- Right?
- Hear hear.
Can you believe how this town is changing?
- Yeah. I don’t even recognize it.
- Have you seen the three-story Gap?
Uh, yeah. Yeah. I haven’t been in there.
- I really like it.
- You think I should check it out?
I mean, I know they tore down
that gorgeous old bank,
but I have more use
for a three-story Gap.
Um... So are you divorced or separated?
- No. Divorced.
- Good.
What... you smoke now?
Yet another thing
you can dislike about me.
Don’t leave it there! Jesus.
So, I've been Christmas shopping.
You don’t have anything to eat.
I bought you a present.
Since when do you Christmas shop?
I even bought your mother
and her new boyfriend a present.
- Why?
- I don’t know.
I’m just trying to cut the shit I guess.
He throws his money around.
- Acts so earnest.
- Well, I think he is earnest.
Well, it’s a five-bedroom house,
and I can’t live there.
No. You can’t live there
because you’re 27 years old,
and it’s time you moved out on your own.
So much for a nice Christmas.
Hey, have you even looked for a job yet?
- Yeah. I got one.
- Oh, you did?
Oh, yeah, I did! And it's, uh,
I’m delivering booze for Gil’s Liquor.
You know what, Pres? It’s a start.
And the tips will be good, and...
Are you staying with friends or...
- what?
- Or what.
Where are you staying?
That’s not for you to worry about.
Okay, well, then you should, uh,
probably take this now.
Happy Christmas.
Oh, shit. Don’t look at the tag.
Dad, big spender.
I thought you needed something warm.
Do you like it?
I could really use the cash instead.
I’m just kidding!
Do you think
maybe I could crash here tonight?
No, I don’t think you can crash, Preston.
I think you need to think about
tomorrow night and the night after that.
Look, I want you to be able to stay here.
I really do.
- But, you’re an adult now...
- Can’t I just fucking go to sleep?
No. You have to just fucking grow up!
Hey...
Thank you.
Hi, Dad.
I love you, Dad.
God.
What’s up?
- Man, it’s two o’clock in the morning.
- Yeah. I had a feeling you’d be up.
Are you all right?
No, I had to make
a quick escape.
You got to return this, too.
That shit’s gonna be expensive.
Do your parents know
where you are?
If you’re gonna call them,
I can get out of here.
Yeah, I’d really rather not.
- Well, I need a favor.
- No, you can’t stay here.
It’s not me who needs to stay.
- This is Relic.
- Why?
He’s basically my best friend
in the entire world,
and I need somebody
to look after him for me.
Here.
He’s a kind old man. Hold him.
See. He likes you.
Why are you giving me your turtle?
I’m not going to rehab.
My parents don’t even feed him.
Complain that he smells. And...
if I’m gone, they’re gonna give him away.
They’re assholes.
Where you going?
Yeah.
I have to call your parents.
- Seriously?
- Yeah...
That’s how you’re gonna play this?
Yeah, I can’t just watch you run away.
- I thought you were cool.
- No, I’m not cool.
All right. I should probably warn you...
you’re not
their favorite person right now.
Oh, wow, really?
Tell me something I don’t know.
- What... they know?
- I swear to God
I did not tell anyone.
I don’t know, I’m sorry.
Wow.
So much for confidentiality, Howard.
- It’s a really small town.
- What must they think of me...
Why do you care?
Don’t you hate my parents?
How can you let somebody you don’t
even like have this much control over you?
I don’t...
You have the balls
to live your life, dude.
That’s what sets you apart
from the rest of these fucking zombies.
You can’t go halfway.
You can’t be you and stay in favor.
I don’t know anyone
who would put all that Christmas shit out
in front of their house
without being
completely ashamed of themselves.
Really? You think they're too much?
It’s fucking disgusting.
Hmm.
It just fucking pisses me off.
Like, my parents hate you because you...
left your wife, or whatever,
but, like, I mean, she’s the one
getting married again so, like...
- Excuse me.
- They’re fucking hypocrites.
Like, why is it their business?
She’s the one who’s doing
a hell of lot better than you are.
No offense.
What are you talking about?
You don’t know?
That they’re getting married?
Whoops, I’m sorry.
My mom talks very loud
on the phone. Fuck.
Are you telling me the truth?
Yep.
Big Island.
Maybe gonna be Maui, there was
a lot of back and forth about it.
Um...
Hmm.
Can I have some of this scotch, please?
Uh...
Actually, you got anything stronger?
- Yeah.
- You wanna go to my club house?
But you’re not leaving
that fucking reptile here.
Just follow me.
I figured it out.
I totally forgot.
- I figured out how to end my book.
- Oh, yeah?
So, Oleg thinks he hears,
like, this heartbeat up in space...
Yeah.
- So, he goes to Moscow, but,
- Mm-hmm.
I mean, there’s obviously
no space program anymore.
And anyway, who cares
about a dog that symbolizes the triumph
of a country that doesn’t exist anymore?
So, he’s basically just laughed at...
What is all that?
Oleg starts building his own rocket out
of, like, whatever he can find.
But it’s a fucking suicide mission.
There’s no way that he’ll be able
to reenter the atmosphere.
So, you have crazy old Oleg
who shoots himself off into space.
And it’s not until he’s out there
that he hears it...
Hears what?
There’s this sound
that everything makes in orbit.
A heartbeat.
- Like a "heartbeat" heartbeat?
- Mm-hmm.
Laika’s dead the whole time.
He wasn’t hearing her heartbeat.
He was just hearing his, I mean,
his conscience or whatever. And...
without even realizing it,
he ends up giving himself
the same exact end.
It’s irony or something or whatever...
I think I want to draw it so you can...
really feel like he felt
closer to her out there.
Or, like, free from guilt or something.
You don’t like it?
I think that’s incredibly sad.
I think it’s pretty good.
Whoa!
Have you heard about
this guy that, uh...
in the news,
who raised the price of that AIDS drug?
He’s literally like this fucking
real-life, like, James Bond villain.
Everyone hates him. Like, it’s crazy.
Instead of going into hiding
or trying to clear his name,
he fucking puts a camera
in front of his face
and live-streams his life, 24/7.
- Just to, like, fucking piss people off...
- Helene’s tits are weird.
What?
They’re weird.
She got new ones. They’re...
- They’re kinda...
- Goddammit.
They’re okay. They’re nice even.
But they’re hard...
- I don’t care.
- I think about 'em.
Sometimes for hours,
I think about her tits.
I can't help... Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah. My mom’s got these...
veiny yoga mom arms
and they make me wanna cry.
I wish my kid
would want to hang out with me.
But he just doesn’t.
He’s got no interest at all.
It’s just like
I’m this great big nuisance, that’s all.
Why does she want to get married so fast?
What’s that about?
You know what my dad
always says? "Irregardless."
The fuck does that mean? That even a word?
Absolutely.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He says it all the time.
"Irregardless."
Yeah...
You know why? Because when he was a kid,
he had this big floppy bear,
it was like a big, saggy, shitty bear.
And he carried it everywhere,
and I mean everywhere.
And he held onto that thing,
he held onto that thing way too long,
way past the time when anyone's supposed
to be hanging on to a bear, you know.
So, we took it off him.
And we hid it,
and we pretended that it was lost.
Because we were...
I don't know, we were worried
about him being teased or...
that he wouldn’t grow up
or some bullshit, I don’t know. I mean...
Oh, God, he was so betrayed...
We betrayed him.
He was devastated. He was heartbroken.
What a stupid fucking thing
to be a parent.
Yeah, but it doesn’t have to be.
I feel like you guys all think...
that you have to,
like, worry all the time.
Like, if you weren’t
constantly worrying, like,
you’re bad parents or something.
What is that?
You know what? I’m gonna take you home.
- What?
- Get your things. We’re gonna go.
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Take one of these, take the edge off.
No, no, no, this is bad.
We gotta go. Come on.
- Okay. Fine. Yeah.
- I’m serious. Get your things.
- Let me clean some of this up.
- What’s that for?
It’s stupid.
I thought we might want to shoot it off.
- I’m gonna be in the car.
- Yep.
Charlie.
Charlie.
Are you in there?
Charlie?
Shit!
Charlie!
Charlie.
Northwestern, huh?
I heard you’d gone to college,
but I didn’t know where you ended up.
What are you up to?
Loading boxes, I guess.
Not too many stops.
You might see some familiar faces.
All right. I’ll come back for this.
Oh, God...
Okay.
Surprise! I got your wine.
You’re delivering for Gil?
Put it down there. Come in.
No. I’ve got other deliveries to make.
Don’t be silly. Just put it down.
Okay.
Is he paying you well?
- I make good tips.
- Cheap bastard.
I suppose you haven’t seen Charlie.
Uh... No. Why?
I thought he was in his room packing
for this rehab in Arizona.
Not only wasn’t he packing,
he wasn’t there. And that was yesterday.
He’ll come back.
He’s probably just nervous to go.
I definitely was.
You know,
when I saw you at the window just now,
I thought you were him.
Tell me something.
Are you living out of your car?
I only ask because your mother thought
you might be living out of your car,
and I told her that was preposterous,
but now that I see you,
it sort of looks like
you are living out of your car.
Um... Yeah. It’s temporary.
Oh, my God.
Do you park it somewhere?
Yeah, it’s off of 136. Just by the tracks.
That’s terrible! It’s so cold.
Do kids still hang out down by the tracks
and smoke pot?
Yeah. I guess.
Charlie used to.
Or still does. Who knows?
Well... Jesus.
Do you want a shower? A sandwich?
- Oh, no. I'm okay...
- Sit down.
I know your mother seems pissed,
but the holidays
are about mothers and children,
if they are about anything.
Yeah, well, I wouldn’t really know it.
Well, she’s insisting
on this Christmas Eve dinner,
and I guarantee that has something to do
with the fact that you are here.
- That’s hot enough.
- Thanks.
He’s fucking with me, isn’t he?
He’s pissed off
that we’re insisting on rehab,
so he’s throwing a tantrum. That’s it.
Uh, I mean, I don’t know...
But when you used to pull this crap,
that was it, wasn’t it?
Sure. For sure...
Hey, buddy. Listen,
if you’re gonna pull this crap,
we’re gonna give away your smelly turtle.
I am sick of cleaning that tank
and feeding that thing.
So, you better come home
and deal with what you have to deal with.
It’s not forever,
and you know you need it.
So, call me. Or better yet, show up.
That’ll get him to call.
He loves that stupid thing.
When you’re finished eating,
take a shower. You’re filthy.
Okay.
Okay. Well, uh, I’ll see you.
Your tip’s on the counter.
Oh, you don't have to tip me.
Of course I do.
Oh, well, thank you... for the shower.
And everything.
Hey...
I’m sorry you have
such a disappointing dad.
Okay.
Hi, you’ve reached Helene.
Please leave a message.
Hey, Mom.
Uh, it’s me.
I’m sorry.
I’m sorry.
Okay... bye.
This place is lovely. It’s really cozy.
Your place is so nice. That is gorgeous.
Well, sadly, that’s not my place anymore.
That now belongs to my wife.
- Oh.
- It's okay.
We had many good years there together.
Do you mind if I ask why you split up?
You wanna know what the final straw was?
- Oh, you don’t have to tell me.
- Oh, no, no, no.
No... It’s ridiculous.
We fought about this, um...
separate little thing, like an oven.
It kinda keeps food warm.
We’d just done the whole house.
New furnace.
Floor finishings. Bunch of plumbing work.
And, uh, when it was all done,
and we’d spent all the money,
then she says... she tells me,
"I just want one more thing.
I just want... there’s a little warming
oven that I would really, really..."
And I just lost it. I was awful.
That’s how it goes.
We used to fight about chewing.
- Oh, yeah? How so?
- I don’t know. He chewed.
Ah, that is disgusting!
You know what?
I have one of those food warmers thingies.
- No, you don’t.
- Yes, I do.
- I’ve never used it. She can have it.
- Wow, she’s gonna be delighted.
- I don’t think it’s working.
- No, no.
It’s okay.
It’s okay.
Well, I mean, don’t worry about it.
It’s probably because
we don’t actually know each other.
Listen, if I got upset every time
I didn’t have an orgasm...
Hey, could you please just stop talking?
Thank you.
What is it with you women
and these books?
Excuse me.
"Live Your Best Life Today."
Should I get this? Should I read this?
Are you in my bed...
making fun of my book?
You’re mean.
Uh...
I’m sorry.
You’re right.
You’re right. I am.
I’m very sorry.
Oh. My life is a mess.
And now I can’t fuck.
And you deserve your best life today.
I know I do.
That’s why I bought the fucking book.
Dude, I can smell that shit
from the inside.
Oh, sorry.
Preston Harris.
- Malcom, right? Malcom Tendler?
- Yeah.
Yo. Just stub that out there.
- So how you been, man?
- Do you live here?
As of a couple of months ago, yeah.
Pretty sick, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah. My, uh, wife’s family is into LEDs,
and I’ve been working
with them for a couple of years.
So, you’re married.
Yeah. With a kid on the way.
Holy shit.
And I actually bought this fucker myself,
if you can believe that.
- And this is the one you picked.
- Hell yeah, man.
So, uh, how’ve you been?
- You want, like, a beer or something?
- Uh, no, that's all right.
- I gotta get back to work.
- Dude, I’m sorry, man.
I heard that you did, like,
some time in rehab.
- Oh...
- I actually have
some nonalcoholic beer if you want some.
- You do?
- Yeah. Yes, actually...
Uh, that’s okay.
- You know... I’m still working.
- Right, right, right.
What are LEDs?
You know, lights.
The green alternative, you know.
And, so... is that fun?
Would you say LEDs are your passion?
I mean, it’s all right.
It’s a good living.
Sorry.
I just didn’t think
this was your style, you know.
My style? What...
I mean, what’s your style?
Delivering liquor?
Looks that way.
- All right, Malcom, this was great.
- Yeah. Why don’t we, uh...
You know, I would tip you,
but you’re a colossal dick.
Fuck! Shit!
Okay.
Hey, Gil, it's me. Um...
So, my car just died.
I know.
Listen, I just have one run.
I can do it first thing in the morning.
No, I don't have Triple A.
There’s nothing I can do, man.
Fuck!
Whoo!
Damn.
Oh!
Charlie.
Dad.
Is this Charlie’s turtle
in your bathtub?
Yeah. Yeah, that’s Charlie’s turtle.
- What?
- He came over,
and he was on his way to, uh, rehab,
and he just asked me
to look after it for him.
Why did he give it to you?
I guess he thought I was someone,
you know, he could trust with it.
So, you, you and Charlie Ashford
were, like, friends?
No, no. I just...
You know, I visited him
in the hospital and he, uh...
He... I think he just wanted an adult,
or something, to look after it.
Oh, God.
- I cannot believe...
- he didn’t come to the funeral.
You know,
when will I stop being surprised...
You know he left town?
- When?
- Like a week ago.
Where did he go?
He drove somewhere. I mean...
I’m not really sure.
But he said he was reachable.
That’s so weird.
It’s not that weird.
Everyone kind of hates him right now.
So, I assume you’re not gonna
invite him to dinner tonight?
No. No, why would I do that?
I mean,
he’s not expecting me to, is he?
He’s not even here, so...
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Will you pick up some sliced almonds?
You can use Donny’s car. Do you mind?
No, not at all.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Girls. Hello. What are you doing?
Can I have some of these?
Load up. Load up.
And here... take some of these.
And here, try these guys.
Hours of fun.
Ladies.
Ladies, put all that back.
- Oh, it’s fine.
- It’s not fine.
They’re kids. They’re just having fun.
Those are not for playing with.
Put it back.
Okay, I’m, uh, very sorry.
Apparently I’ve handed you, uh, non-toys.
Mnh-mnh.
- Girls...
- I’ll take those back.
- Come on. Let’s go.
- Come on.
Don’t talk to that man.
Probably got no kids
of his own. Wanna play father.
Oh, no, no, no... we’re coming.
We need it, are you kidding?
Besides,
I’ve been baking all morning!
- Baking?
- I made eclairs!
And a chocolate bread pudding.
You know you didn’t need to do that.
You don’t need to do anything.
Oh, the smell! It’s heavenly.
- See you soon.
- Okay...
Ah!
- What a surprise.
- Hi.
You fixed your car?
No. I drove Donny’s.
You remember when we used to,
uh, do the jumping on the bed? You were...
What are you doing here?
I mean, you’re staying at a hotel
an hour from your condo.
You know, well,
sometimes you need a neutral space.
I hate to tell you, Dad.
This place is not neutral.
This is depressing.
Yeah, sometimes you need that, too.
That is the deed to the house.
Which I’m gonna give to your mom.
With what money?
That’s not an unreasonable question, Dad.
No. The house now belongs to Donny O'Neil.
Huh?
Yeah, he offered to buy me out.
And you said yes?
Well, do they know?
Not yet, no.
I was gonna put that in the mail.
Look, come on. You’re up here alone.
Come back with me.
It’s Christmas Eve.
And you bought all those presents.
Give 'em your presents.
- I can’t go back.
- Yes, you can.
My friends. Come on in.
You guys know you didn’t
have to come, right? Let alone cook.
We couldn’t stay in bed
one more day.
- You’re our family.
- Yeah, we wanted to be here.
If at any point you feel like leaving,
please, do whatever
makes you comfortable. Okay?
Hey, guys.
Oh, I could use some red.
- Honey. Not with the Xanax.
- I’d like some red.
- Okay, me too.
- Yeah. Okay.
Two reds.
- You guys take a seat, okay.
- Okay.
So, we’re gonna do it on the Big Island.
They have the most options
in terms of resorts.
Where’s Preston?
Sorry.
Preston. Where is he?
Oh, uh... I don't actually know.
It’s not unusual.
I thought he lived here.
Oh, yeah. I sent him out
on an errand, uh, hours ago.
Interesting.
So, when did, uh, Kat go back to Seattle?
This morning.
Why don’t we go into the dining room?
- Good.
- Yeah.
There you are.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Okay.
Oh, Jesus. Um...
- I don’t think you should be here.
- Why not?
Sophie and Mitchell are
in the other room,
and they’re kind of out of their minds
right now.
- You, too.
- I thought it would be okay.
Don’t worry about it.
I had a feeling you might be
hiding people...
- They’re actually on their way out.
- Oh, I hope not.
Anders, you’ll stay for a drink, at least?
- I just gotta drop these off.
- Bullshit. It’s Christmas!
Look who I found hiding in the kitchen.
Sophie, Mitchell...
Okay...
I’ve been away. That's, um...
That’s why I missed the funeral.
And I’m so, so sorry.
He was an exceptional kid.
And I always thought he was very,
very special.
He admired you.
Thank you. I...
I don’t know why.
I could never figure it out. I mean...
Why you?
What’s so much more acceptable about you?
And then I realized,
you’re the fucked up one.
You’re the one who threw everything away.
I want to know some things.
I have some questions for you.
- Preston.
- I have questions for you.
- Preston did not do anything.
- Nobody said he did.
Irregardless, I would like to know,
what you were doing out
on those railroad tracks.
And why was it you, of all people,
who found my son?
He was trying to get warm.
Could you let the boy
speak for himself?
No, I was just walking around trying
to get warm, 'cause the...
The heat in my car wasn’t working
so I was just walking around.
You see that?
I don’t believe that.
You’re telling me that you went outside
in the woods to get warm?
I was gonna drink.
I had stolen the champagne
and I was gonna drink it.
- But I didn't drink it...
- There you go.
Now we’re getting somewhere.
Mitchell, that’s enough.
Now how would that be enough
if we’re just now getting to the truth?
You did drugs with my son, didn’t you?
I was with him. Preston wasn’t.
Dad, it's...
He came over to my house that night.
He brought his turtle.
And he, uh...
wanted me to take care of it.
He wouldn’t have done that.
He loves that turtle.
Why would he do that?
I assumed because he was running away.
When was he with you?
Earlier. That night. Earlier that night.
And you didn’t call us?
- How could you not call us?
- Oh, my God...
Um... I was... I was...
I was going to. I...
He, uh...
I told him that I was gonna take him home
- and that is when he ran off.
- So, he brought you his turtle.
- And then he left?
- Yeah.
No. He... I...
I went with him, and, um...
- we did a small amount of drugs...
- What?
Before he ran off.
No, you didn’t.
Yeah, I did.
What? You...
You did?
- Why would you do that?
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
The point is that, um...
He...
I’m sure that it was an accident
because he just didn’t want
to go to rehab.
Don’t talk to me about my son.
How dare you?
The things I could tell you.
The things I know.
Sophie, please don’t do this.
Your wife has been sleeping with him
for over two years.
What?
Is that true? Is she serious?
You smug little fuck. You let it happen!
No, Mitchell!
Dad!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!
The sunflowers
will take over everything. The...
ivy and then the lilies.
It’s hysterical.
Somehow everything survives.
These perennials, they are relentless.
That means they go all year round?
Uh, yes, they bloom every year.
You don’t have to replant them.
And these hydrangeas...
you usually have to replace,
but, uh,
these have been blooming for decades.
Actually, these were here
when we got here. Yeah.
How long did you live here?
Oh. We were here a long time.
Yeah, I raised my son here.
He's, uh... He’s a grown up now. Mostly.
He’ll, uh, be going to graduate school
in the city.
Nice.
Well, thank you so much for coming over
and explaining all this stuff to me.
When I talk to the gardener,
I want to know what I’m saying.
Yes. Okay.
Let’s go inside.
Let's go inside.
No. No, no, no.
That one’s volume,
and that one’s the channel.
You know, I like your place.
It’s small. Yeah.
It is small, but it is also...
very nice.
I brought you some things.
They are things I didn’t use.
And you can use them
or not use them. Decorating.
Thanks.
I gotta go. I have a date.
Oh! Well, someone should.
Okay.
- See ya.
- Bye.
Wow.
- Mmm! Where’d you learn to do this?
- I, um...
took some cooking classes with a friend.
- How retired of you.
- Thank you very much.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Mmm. Delicious.
