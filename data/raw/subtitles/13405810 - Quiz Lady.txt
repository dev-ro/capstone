[Terry on TV] But now,
put on your thinking caps.
It's America's new
favorite game show.
[audience cheering, applauding]
[Terry] It’s seven o’clock on a
weeknight, which can only mean one thing.
It’s time for...
- Can’t Stop the Quiz!
- [audience] Can’t Stop the Quiz!
[Terry] I’m your
host, Terry McTeer.
[chuckles] Oh, my God!
[gasps] You made out
with David Zelman?
[Anne's dad] You
lost 600 dollars?
- [Anne's mom speaking Cantonese]
- [Anne's dad speaking Korean]
[in English] I want a divorce!
- [door slamming]
- [Anne's mom shouts]
- [shouting in Cantonese]
- [Terry in English] Welcome. Best of luck.
May I have five minutes
on the clock, please?
[audience cheering]
["I Don't Feel Like
Dancin'" playing]
And your time starts now!
Welcome!
- Ready to learn and have some fun?
- [laughs]
- Countries on the equator. Whoa!
- [bell dinging]
Correct! Correct! Wow!
You guys are smart.
Welcome, Ralph, hope you're
enjoying Los Angeles.
Do me a favor, don't miss
the La Brea Tar Pits.
They're lovely.
[Anne's mom] Your cousin, Jin, just
got into Harvard Medical School!
And you’re dropping out?
It’s bad enough you go
to community college!
I don’t need school!
I’m gonna be an actress.
[Anne's mom] Oh!
You’re making me crazy.
- I’m going to the casino.
- [Jenny] Have fun losing all our money!
That was incredible! You
almost knocked my bow tie off.
- I would've felt quite nude.
- [chuckles]
Don’t go anywhere.
- I know I won’t.
- I know I won’t.
[Terry] What an incredible game!
I learned so much. I had no
idea pineapple is a berry.
That blows my mind.
Join us tomorrow for another night
of fast facts and live learning!
I’m Terry McTeer and
I’ll be right here.
- [audience applauding]
- Have a good night!
Thank you so much. Have a
great trip back to Delaware.
I hear there's no
sales tax there.
- Wild stuff!

My God! I love that

[coworker] Oh, we love you.
Happy hour after
this. Happy hour.
- Yes!
- Yeah.
[indistinct chatter]
[Anne] Okay, let's get
inside, get inside.
[Francine] Anne?
Anne, is that you?
[Anne] Get inside.
Anne, your stupid postman
has done it again.
Once again, he's left one of your
packages in front of my door.
Oh, man. Uh, my mistake.
- [grunts]
- Yeah, well, what happens
when there's an unexpected
package in front of my door?
- I, um...
- I trip over it and I fall and I die.
- Mm-hmm.
- Your stupid postman is trying to kill me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
Please speak to him.
[Anne] I'll leave him a
voice mail. Thank you.

Look, Linguini, it finally came.
[Mr. Linguini snoring]
[cellphone ringing]
[Anne] Linguini!
[Terry] It’s time for...
- Can’t Stop the Quiz!
- [audience] Can’t Stop the Quiz!
I’m your host, Terry McTeer.
Let’s meet tonight’s contestants!
Starting with Linda, who
came all the way from Idaho.
- Did you bring any potatoes?
- Uh...
- I'm just kidding. [chuckles]
- [audience laughing]
[Terry] And then we have
our returning champion,
- Ron Heacock from Ohio.
- [audience applauding, cheering]
[Terry] Ron, you must be
getting pretty comfortable here.
You're now the third
longest-running champion.
Congratulations! That's
quite an achievement.
Uh, honestly, I’m just
glad to be here, Terry.
- Uh, I’m a huge fan.
- [Terry] Oh!
[audience] Aw!
- Please let this be the night...
- [Terry] Last but not least,
- we have Adrian.
- He finally loses. [sighs]
Ron, your winning
streak continues!
[chuckles] Thank you. But
Linda, you did so great tonight.
I... I wish we could both win.
Hey! How about it, Terry?
Can there be two winners?
[chuckles]
Unfortunately, no,
there can't be.
Oh. Just me then.
[exhales]
[Trav] All I'm saying... Okay, you
put the money into the computer.
It prints you the money back.
- You don't lose any money.
- If you want me to invest in an app...
- [cellphone ringing]
- I'm not gonna...
[Trav] I sent this in an email.
Did you not read the email?
- [Marge] I don't open those things.
- [Trav] You don't open my emails?
- [Marge] Any emails, ever.
- Hi, Mom.
[Shannon] Hi! This is
Shannon from Sunnyvale.
I have some bad news.
- [man snores]
- We lost your mom.
What?
[Shannon] Oh, my God. [laughs]
Sorry, that was terrible phrasing.
I meant we don't know where she is.
- [exhales deeply]
- Yes, she's not dead, but she is missing.
Have you checked Rivers Casino?
- Penny Palace, House of Slots?
- Yes, we checked all her usual spots.
- Can you come in?
- [sighs] I mean...
- [door chimes]
- [Walters whispers] Here she is.
Uh. Ms. Yum, thank you
so much for coming in.
Well, would you like to
wait for your sister?
She’ll be here momentarily.
My sister? You...
you called Jenny?
Well, when we lose someone, we
have to call everybody. [chuckles]
- We didn’t lose her, she ran away.
- Oh! Right.
It's okay. She does
this sometimes.
Due to the sheer number
of rules violations,
we can no longer keep
your mother as a resident.
So, you're kicking her out?
- Enough is enough.
- It's enough.
[Walters] Ms. Yum,
in signing the
resident agreement,
- she agreed to adhere to our policies.
- [Jenny screams]
[Walters] Sneaking out is
a very serious violation.
- We can't be responsible for her safety.
- [indistinct screaming, yelling]
She’s also really mean. It's less
important, but it’s not nothing.
- [door thudding]
- Uh. I think your sister's here.
- [cries] Hello! Annie! Annie, let me in!
- [Anne] The button! Push the button!
- Hit the button. There's a button there.
- [yells] Annie! I can't hear you!
- Hit the god...
- [Jenny] What?
- [Anne] There's a... there's a button there.
- I can't see it!
- [Anne] There's a...
- What button? What button?
- [door chiming]
- [sighs]
- Well, that wasn't very clear.
- Oh, well...
[sobs] Annie! Annie,
it's finally happened.
- Oh, my God, it's okay, it's okay.
- [Anne] No, no...
I'm here. I'm here, we're together.
We're gonna get through this.
- This is a part of life. [sobs]
- Jenny, what are you wearing?
Oh, it's the only
black dress I own.
- Okay.
- I can't believe she's gone.
- Mm-mm. No, she...
- [Jenny] Oh, my God.
We're orphans. Oh, my
God. You're Orphan Annie.
- Oh, my God.
- She's not dead. She ran away.
- [exhales sharply]
- That fucking bitch.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So, we took the liberty of packing
up your mother’s belongings.
Thank you. What a
pleasant eviction.
Oh, good! I'm so glad. Oh? Great news!
It looks like your mom left a note.
It’s mostly personal
attacks on me.
Oh, but it does say she
and Jeff are off to Macao.
So, at least you know
where she is! [chuckles]
- Who's Jeff?
- Who's Jeff?
- [playful music playing]
- She has a boyfriend?
I mean, why didn't she tell us?
Because she only calls
when she needs money.
[Jenny] Oh, you’re
parked right by me!
- [car trunk creaking]
- Are you living out of your car?
No!
It's just some stuff I've been
meaning to donate and... Oh, my God.
This amazing lamp that
I found in an alley
and some... blankets,
in case I wanted a nap.
Well...
sorry, you wasted all your
time driving out here.
Oh, actually...
I was hoping that maybe I can
stay with you for a little bit.
Why?
Well, I thought I was going
to since Mom was dead.
Come on, Annie.
Come on, it's gonna be fun!
- And I really wanna see my dog.
- Your dog?
I made it to the final round of
auditions for The Real World!
I have to go to L.A. tomorrow
to meet with the producers!
- Oh, my God!
- But...
- What about your puppy?
- [Jenny] Oh, yeah.
Can you take care
of Mr. Linguini?
- [Terry] You added 2,500 dollars...
- [Jenny] Thanks! Thank you! [laughs]
- and that's not nothing.
- [audience applauding]
[exhales] You know,
it feels smaller.
- Are you sure you didn't make it smaller?
- No, I didn’t shrink my house.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
He's dead.
No, he's sleeping! Mr. Linguini!
Hey! Psst, psst, psst.
[farts]
See? Full of life.
[Mr. Linguini snoring]
[Jenny] Shit!
[grunts]
[grunts, exhales sharply]
- So, uh... how long you planning on staying?
- Oh, I don't know. A few days.
Few days? Don't they need
you back at your... job?
Oh, no, I don't have a job.
Okay, well, are you
looking for a job?
I’m focusing all my energy on
manifesting the life I want.
But what... [stammers] What
are you gonna do for money?
Because I don't know if
I can lend you any more.
And Mom's nursing home
- isn't exactly...
- Okay, I don't need money.
I'm getting plenty
from my lawsuit.
From your... From your what? From
your lawsuit? Sorry, what lawsuit?
Oh, I didn't tell
you? Oh, my God.
I had a business
lunch at Choochie's
with this guy who wanted to
invest in my fashion line,
and I took a bite of my tilapia filet,
and there was a fish bone in it.
It got stuck in my throat,
and I almost choked to death.
[chokes, grunts]
So, I sued them.
So, you sued Choochie’s
because there was a fish
bone in your fish fillet?
I'm sorry. I almost died.
Why can't you just be happy I
got a bunch of money from them?
I mean, who are
you? Mr. Choochie's?
Now, why would I be
"Mr. Choochie's?"
'Cause it's a man's world.
[Mr. Linguini snores]
Don't... Don't just leave
that hair there, please.
Okay, Dad.
[cellphone ringing]
Oh, my God. Do you have a
Quiz alarm on your phone?
- [audience applauding]
- Come on, Linguini! It's Quiz time.
Let’s meet tonight's contestants.
Starting with our returning champion...
Yeah, there you go.
Ron Heacock from... [coughs]
Excuse me! From Ohio.
- You okay, Terry?
- Yes. I just ate some crackers backstage.
Must’ve gotten some crumbs
down the wrong pipe.
- That’s live television for you.
- [audience laughing]
Good. 'Cause I worry about
you, Terry. You work so hard.
You should loosen up that
bow tie. Take a vacation.
- Aww.
- Don't "aww" him. He's a jerk.
But he seems so nice.
And he's so smiley.
He's not. It's an act.
He's trying to be like Terry. And
look at how shiny his hands are.
- He puts makeup on his hands.
- Some people have ugly hands.
All the way from Kentucky,
Margret, I have to ask you, did
you ride your horse to the studio?
[audience laughing]
[chuckles] Welcome.
And your time starts now.
- What is the square root of 196?
- Fourteen.
- [Terry] Ron? Correct.
- Fourteen.
- How many hearts does an octopus have?
- Three.
- [Terry] Ron? Correct.
- Three.
- What?
- [Terry] What spice is derived
from Crocus sativus?
- Saffron.
- I feel like an answer hog. But saffron.
[Terry] Correct.
- Carbon dioxide.
- [Terry] Very good.
- [Anne] Wellington, New Zealand.
- [Terry] Correct.
Saturn. Our American Cousin.
The equal sign.
- Harry Potter.
- The Hobbit.
- [Terry] Correct.
- All right. Bless you.
Ron, please list for us
the gods of Mount Olympus.
Aphrodite, Apollo, Ares, Artemis, Athena,
Demeter, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Her... Hey!
Why haven't you
gone on that show?
Are you scared that you
would win so much money
that people will try
and kill you for it?
You know, that's a thing
with lottery winners.
- No, it's not...
- [gasps] Are you scared
that your hatred for that Ron guy
is actually a sexual attraction
that you wouldn't know how to
navigate in person? [chuckles]
No!
It's just... I'm
not... good at...
being looked at, you know?
It’s time for the Flip!
- [audience] Ten, nine, eight...
- [scoffs] Stupid coin.
- I love the coin. It's so big.
- Seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.
[audience cheering]
- [audience] Show it!
- [Terry] Show it!
- Show it.
- Our contestants will act out the answers
while their partners guess.
Wait, what are you doing? The
charades thing is the only fun part!
It’s not fun, it’s
a cheap gimmick.
They changed the entire final round
to boost ratings, it's so dumb.
Who wants to watch people
embarrass themselves?
I do.
Waltz. Waltzer.
[laughs] Oh, my
God. He's dancing.
Sidewalk. Concrete.
Waltzer. Concrete...
Walter Cronkite.

[Jenny] I focus on my
destiny all the time.
I want to be rich and famous,
and loved by everybody. Why?
Because I want to be a powerful force
for good in this world, you know?
I just haven't found, you know,
the path to get there yet.
I mean, do you have any idea
how hard it is to be an
Asian woman in this country?
- Yes, I read an article.
- Like, we have to keep going.
Like, I've always wanted to
open my own bakery, you know?
- And then life got in the way.
- Mm-hmm.
And now, I never bake anymore,
and I feel so unfulfilled.
You need to change your life.
You can because you're strong.
So, are you done
with your plate?
- Oh, yeah.
- [chuckles]
[laughs]
Since when does it take you 20
minutes to service one table?
[Wendy] We started talking.
- [Carl] You can't just sit and hang out.
- [Wendy] She believes in me, Carl.
Oh, my God!
Thanks!
Hi. I had a huge day.
- Why are you sitting out here?
- [Jenny] Oh, I locked myself out.
- Well, let's get inside before...
- Anne, is this lunatic your sister?
I told you.
She threatened to call the cops
because she thought I was, what?
- Was it loitering?
- You were loitering.
I thought you were loitering
with an intent to murder.
Oh, do I look like a murderer?
- Yes. Well, yes, you do.
- [Jenny] Oh, really?
- [Francine] I can see your brassiere.
- Okay, okay. I'm... I'm sorry about her.
- Like...
- Sorry about me? What did I do?
- Why are you... Why?
- Put a sock in it.
Okay, so, I went to go get
coffee and I met this woman.
Oh, my God! She was so sad. But we
got to talking, and I helped her.
And helping her
made me feel better.
And just like that, I saw
it. I saw the path forward.
Don't move my stuff.
Why do you have a bobblehead
of Justin Timberlake?
It's Terry McTeer, and
it's limited edition.
It’s from the 300th episode!
Do you know the heated eBay war
I had to endure to get that?
- [Jenny] It's Justin Timberlake.
- It's Terry McTeer.
Okay, as I was
saying, I have decided
I am going to become...
a life coach.
- You know, like Oprah.
- [laughs] Oh, yeah. Yes. Linguini!
- What's so funny? This is my destiny.
- [Anne] Oh, there you are.
Yeah, you and your destinies.
First, it was figure skating,
then it was acting, and then...
And then you wanted
to be a music icon.
- And then it was fashion design.
- Yeah, but this is different.
How?
I'll show you, you know what? Because
you're gonna be my first project.
I don't need a life coach.
Uh, really? Because
from what I can tell,
you’re like a 28-year-old woman, living
the life of a 98-year-old widower.
I'm 33.
And why am I always a man
in your hypotheticals?
Because men are worse.
[Anne] Well, I like my
life just the way it is.
Okay, Ron. Chuck has chosen geography.
Let's see what we have for you.
- Please list for us...
- What are you doing?
- [Terry] ...South American capital cities.
- Yoga.
Buenos Aires, Lima, Sucre, Brasília,
Santiago, Bogotá, Quito, Caracas,
- Montevideo, Asunción.
- Caracas...
I knew I should have paid more attention
when I backpacked through South America
- after I graduated law school.
- [audience laughing]
Darn it.
Let's see, Chuck, it's your
turn. How about language?
[Terry] Chuck, please list for us
nouns that do not have a singular form.
Scissors, clothes, pants, jeans, trousers,
shorts, tights, goggles, sunglasses,
tweezers, belongings,
boxers, briefs.
North American river
borders. All right, okay.
Detroit, Pine, Pigeon, Rainy.
Saint Clair, Saint Croix, Saint
Francis, Saint Lawrence, Saint Mary's.
Nucleus, nucleolus, mitochondria,
Golgi complex, cell membrane,
nuclear envelope, cytoskeleton.
[Ron groans]
[Marge] Did you see it? I was like,
"Don't we work with that girl?"
And I was like, "Oh,
my God. Yes, I do."
And then I was... Oh, my God!
- Hey, it's the Quiz Lady. [chuckles]
- What?
You were like, "Spain. Killer
whale. Octagon." [chuckles]
- So, what are you talking about?
- Hello!
You're on the front page
of Reddit. Your video.
[Anne] ...outskirts,
premises, surroundings.
[tense music playing]
[Anne] Oh, no.
Oh, Quiz Lady.
Oh, my God.
- Lysosomes, ribosomes, nucleus...
- Oh, no.
Yo, what up fam? As promised,
The Quiz Lady. [laughs]
Yo, that video was so funny, dude.
I dropped my phone in the toilet.
Don't worry, just pee.
Can you give me, like, a quick
"wassup" to my followers?
No! I need a minute.
- Hi, have you seen Twitter?
- How did this happen?
[Jenny] You are viral!
I posted it last night,
and then when I woke up this
morning it was everywhere.
I mean, I have a ton of followers
from that time Elon Musk yelled at me.
- But...
- Delete... Delete it right now.
Wait! You cannot buy this
hype. Get this, get this!
- Okay, the producers...
- I have to go.
- I'm still here.
- She always does this.
She just floats through
life without ever thinking
about how her actions
affect other people.
Did you know that when were kids we
went to the Heinz Ketchup Museum,
our father brought us
there, and she was furious
'cause she wanted to watch Supercop
3, and she'd just gotten it on DVD.
And, so, she knocks over an
entire display of ketchup
and we get thrown
out onto the street
by a Heinz ketchup
security guard.
And I really wanted to
learn about ketchup.
I wanted to have
that experience.
I didn't get to have that
experience. Now, look at me now.
I think it's just
tomatoes, though.
- You know, with sugar and spices.
- Oh, my God.
They want me to
be on local news.
- [Trav] Dope!
- I don't want to be news.
I would kill to be local news.
Internal auditing.
[Gerald] Quiz Lady! I'm a
huge fan. My name's Gerald.
I'm what you might
call a sexual cannibal.
It is what you think it is,
and do you wanna get lunch?
The internet knows where I work.
The internet knows where I work.
[Anne through video] Niagara,
Detroit, Pine, Detroit...
[overlapping video audio]
- Hey, say something smart.
- Sorry. I can't.
Come on!
[overlapping video
audio continues]
[Ken] Anne Yum.
I didn't mean to startle you.
I'm a friend of your mom's.
Do you know where she is?
No, sorry.
[Ken] You sure? 'Cause I'd
really like to find her.
She owes me some money.
She... She said she quit.
Aside from occasional penny
slots. How much does she owe?
- Eighty grand.
- Eighty grand?
And imagine my pleasant surprise
when her daughter with the goofy
little bangs became famous.
Saved me all the trouble
of tracking you down.
So, where is she?
Do you really want to protect her?
You probably don't even like her.
I know I don't. [chuckles]
Come on, don't be stupid.
Tell me where she is.
Macao.
- Macao.
- I can't help you.
Of course, you can.
You can cover her debt.
I don't have 80,000 dollars.
Neither do I, and
that's the problem.
Call me when you have it...
and you'll get your dog back.
- [car engine revving]
- ["More" playing over radio]
[Anne] My dog?
- My dog?
- You have two weeks.
After that, you'll
never see him again.
Let's go grab some cronuts.
- Amazing! We'll be there, thank you.
- [tense music playing]
[Anne] Linguini!
- [Jenny] Annie, what's going on?
- [Anne] Linguini!
[tense music concluding]
Who's even named Ken anymore?
This is all your fault. He found
me because of your stupid video.
- Are you calling him?
- I'm calling Mom.
It's not gonna do anything.
- [cellphone dinging]
- [Crystal over cellphone] Jenny?
You left us with an
80,000 dollars debt?
[Crystal] It's
okay, I'm in Macao.
Jeff, get me another Mai Tai!
Okay, you know what? It's not
okay. None of this is okay.
Your bookie threatened
Annie and kidnapped my dog.
He's not your dog.
[Crystal] Not a bad deal.
- That dog's so old.
- [Jenny] That's not the point!
[Crystal] What do you expect me
to do about it? I'm in Macao!
[Jenny] You need to fix it. We
can't afford to pay them off!
[Crystal] Fine! Come to Macao. Jeff
rented a condo. But no free rides.
We don't wanna live
in your goddamn condo.
[Crystal] Don't swear.
Aiya, who raised you?
Nobody!
[glass shattering]
- Told you.
- [breathes heavily]
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
- What? What? Are they here?
Annie, Annie, Annie!
This is all connected.
This is synergy
from the universe.
Oh, my God. I think I
might have manifested this.
I hate all the
words you just used.
Oh, my God. This is how
you're gonna make the money.
Okay, someone from the Quiz just
called. They saw your video.
What? No! No! That
is so embarrassing.
No, no, no, no. No,
see, they loved it,
and they're in the middle
of a casting round,
and they want... No, come on.
They want you to come to the
in-person regional auditions
this weekend. Where?
In Philadelphia!
- No, that's not happening.
- Oh, my God. Why not?
I mean, you could win 80,000
dollars just like that.
I mean, you got
every question right.
I can't play on live TV in
front of millions of people.
In front of
Terry-freakin' McTeer.
I can't, I can't. There
has to be another way.
You could sell your eggs. I mean,
it's not like you're using them.
- I'm not gonna sell my eggs.
- Okay!
Well, I am not gonna let
Mom's bullshit ruin your life.
- Too late.
- [melancholy music playing]
[Anne] So, I looked on CarMax,
and it said I could easily sell
my car for around 20,000...
[door knocking, lock clicking]
[lock clicking]
[melancholy music concludes]
Hi. The paperboy missed the
porch again, but by a mile.
I mean, he threw it in
the driveway, the jerk.
I'm pretty sure he's
vaping drugs again.
Bending over that far,
it’s actually dangerous for
an almost ghost like me.
Could you help?
Oh, say, uh, can I
borrow your phone a sec?
I just want to
check on my stocks.
- Is everything all right? You seem weird.
- What do you mean? I’m fine.

Where's my 100 bucks?
Thanks. Um, sorry, I
don't have any cash on me.
[Anne] Hey! How could
you do this to me
when I was just threatened
by a genuine Tong?
That’s why I yelled,
“Don't be scared. It’s me!”
- [Anne] Jenny!
- What is a Tong?
Asian gangsters. You
know, read a book.
- [Anne] Jenny!
- Thank you very much.
[Anne] Jenny, let me out of

[Anne] Jenny! Let me

- Settle down!
- [Anne] You want me to settle down?
- You kidnapped me!

Good morrow, ladies. Welcome
to the Ben Franklin Inn & Spa.
May I interest you in some johnnycakes
made fresh this morning by my lovely...
self?
Um, don’t touch that.
- [groans]
- [Anne] We have a reservation.
It’s under Anne Yum.
Ah! Yes. I heard your voice on
that marvelous machine right there,
that I have heard is called the
telephone, but I am unfamiliar with it.
Identification and
credit card, please.
You don't know what a phone is,
but you know about credit cards?
The concept of a credit card
is an easy one to grasp.
I know what credit is, and I can assure
you I'm familiar with cards. [laughs]
But that talking machine
was invented after my time.
- [telephone ringing]
- Oh, what is that sound?
’Tis a chirping bird?
Ben Franklin Inn, please hold.
Uh, so, are you supposed
to be Ben Franklin?
Because if Ben Franklin had
just been alive this whole time,
he would know what phones are.
I mean, he was really smart.
Well, that is very kind of
you to say that I am smart.
Yeah, but if you don't know
about phones, then what?
You're just like a ghost of Ben Franklin,
who’s somehow stuck in the 1600s?
- 1700s.
- And if you are stuck in the past,
then your inn should not have all
this modern stuff. But it does.
I mean, it makes no sense.
So, which is it? What are you?
I... am Ben Franklin.
Then why don't you have wooden
teeth like George Washington?
- Jenny.
- And... lifting.
- Can you just let him be Ben Franklin?
- In my family, we have wrinkly foreheads.
I just want to let you know, sir,
that you're doing a great job.
- Thank you.
- Good.
Well, he's using a computer.
How very 17th century.
- Eighteenth century.
- What?
Even though your time is limited
in our wonderful capital of
the United States of America,
which is how I know it.
I, Ben Franklin, know it.
If you need any help,
don't hesitate to call.
- On the phone?
- Yes. On the phone.
Future’s greatest gift.
Tina!
Would you please show our
guests to their chambers?
Please take more time

Welcome to the Betsy Ross suite.
Oh, can you take
this? Thank you.
Right. Cute.
Jenny, we’re too
old to share a bed.
Speak for yourself, Ben Franklin.
The thirties are the new twenties.
Since when are you
in your thirties?
Oh, since I did a guess-my-age
filter and it said thirty...
nine.
You know, this place sucks.
Let's go to a real hotel.
They have to have rooms
they keep open just in case.
- I'll get them to give us one.
- How?
Oh, I am amazing
at getting stuff.
I get really emotional and talk
a lot, so they get confused,
and then they're willing to do
whatever they can to make it stop.
See, just one second.
Like this. [inhales]
Please! Oh, my God!
I know you’re only serving
the breakfast menu,
but my husband needs fries!
He has a rare kidney condition, and
if he doesn’t get salt, he’ll die!

You would publicly humiliate yourself
just to eat fries at breakfast?
How is that humiliating?

Then why'd she ask to change

It was nice of that

You know, Phillies fans get a bad
rap, but deep down they’re nice.
Sometimes stereotypes are wrong.
They're always wrong.
Hmm.
It's funny, the word “stereotype”
has a fascinating etymology
that I was reading about
earlier... Good Lord!
How are you not in a massive
amount of pain right now?
Oh, this happens all the time.
Ever since I tried to catch a foul
ball at that World Series game.
When I was dating Sammy.
Anyway, it hurts
when it pops out,
and when it goes back in, but
in between, it’s not that bad.
That is not just dislocated.
That is definitely broken.
Oh, no, it's not. I bet you,
I could pop it back in myself.
- No.
- Okay, but now, it’s gonna...
- Okay. God!
- Jenny.
God! Did you hear that?
That was actually...
- That was a crack!
- A little bit.
- No, I can't.
- I’m gonna try it again. Wait.
I can’t. It goes so far back!
- Really? But it's...
- It goes so far back.
- Does that gross you out?
- I’m gonna throw up!
[laughs]
- Jenny!
- Okay. Okay.
- Can you put the ice pack on it...
- Okay. Okay.
To cover it, so I don’t
have to look at it?
'Cause you’re
scared of my wrist.
Really, it doesn’t
hurt that much.
Too bad cousin Jin isn't here.
- Fix that up for you.

"He's the best
surgeon in the world."

California? He was so into skateboarding
- but he was terrible at it.

felt like I belonged.
["Walkin' on the

Too bad they hated us and
never invited us back.
Yeah.
I always hated
being around them.
They were so intimidating.
When we went to go stay with
them, I was so nervous...
that I didn't shit for, like,
the whole month we were there.
So, one night, I
woke up with just...
the gurgles. You know
what I mean? And...
I was so scared that maybe they would,
like, hear it or that I’d clog the toilet
or, like, something
would happen.
So, I went out in
the backyard...
and I dug a little hole...
and I shit in there.
That's how unwelcome
I felt in that house.
I never told anyone about that.
It was all too much.
The way that they would look
at us like we were... trash.
No, they... They wanted to help,
that's why they let us stay there.
They didn’t even talk about Dad.
They were so embarrassed
about how he died.

We’re calling him Porky now.
Isn’t that right, Mr. Porky?

“Don’t mind if I do.”
That’s how I picture him

You’re running out of time.

I mean, aren’t you supposed
to have a great memory?
Yeah, for things of note.
Oh, well. I remember
everyone you've ever dated

weird kid who was so pale
he was practically see-through.
Francoise was not see-through.
Yeah, well. It was like someone
Saran-wrapped a skeleton.
- Ooh, Kahi Bounce Balm?
- No.
Are you sure? It’s Korean.
And also, Francoise and I weren’t
dating, we were just friends.
It wasn’t his fault that
he was allergic to the sun.
- What are you doing?
- I want space.
Ah, okay. Well, I
sleep with two pillows.
- Thank you very much. Yes, I do.
- Do you sleep with two pillows?
Because you can sleep with
two pillows on the floor.
I’m sorry, I’m injured, I'm
not sleeping on the floor.
- I'm not sleeping on the floor, either.
- Then sleep on the chair.
I don't wanna sleep

- [laughs] Oh, hello!
- [Mercedes] Okay!
- I'm sorry.
[sighs] Okay. That was amazing.
I had no idea you've
seen all those movies!
I haven't. I feel like
my heart's gonna explode.
Okay? Um. You know what? Here's
something. Eat something. Eat this.
Uh. It might take the edge off.
You know what? I have some...
I have some water in here too.
- So, maybe... Okay, okay. You know what?
- [grunts]
- [groans]
- That's good. Take a moment.
- Take a moment. Breathe.
- [groans]
God, it's like you're a boxer or
something! This is so exciting!
- [groans]
- Okay. Okay. There's just, like, what?
The Coin?
- Oh, God. The Coin!
- [rock music playing]
[Mercedes] I know, it
looks a lot bigger on TV.
- Heads is "Say It" and tails is "Show It!
- [whimpers]
- [groans]
- And it's heads!
Yes! Victory is mine!
And I feel so relieved
because I can win now,
and the clouds above won't die.
Yes, yes. The clouds won't
die. They're gonna live.
It's an old Chinese
saying, you know?
- Yeah. Blessings.
- [audience] Ah!
[gentle music playing]
Okay. Here we are, here we are.
- Step down, step down, and down.
- The metal chariot.
- No, no, no, no, no, no. Not... Not that.
- I don't go in the trunk?
- Shotgun.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, okay. All right.
- Well, at least I did it.
Uh. You didn't just do it,
Annie. You crushed that audition.
Okay? Yeah, yeah. Okay.
Just get in, get in.
Wanna get your leg in? Okay,
there we go. She's in, she's in.
- Not kidnapping her, are you?
- [chuckles] Not anymore.
[indistinct chatter]
Ah!
Surprising that you
have Eggs Benedict here.
Yeah! Oh, yes! Pains me to serve
a dish named after a traitor.
Alas, it's a popular item which the
ignorant expect on every buffet.
And herein lies my
conundrum. [chuckles]
Sounds like you might need
to make a pro-con list.
Oh! [chuckles] Look
at you, Miss Yum.
You have read my 1772 letter to
Joseph Priestly, have you not?
- Well...
- That's wonderful. [chuckles]
- [Jenny] Annie!
- Uh-oh, the enemy.
[chuckles] Oh, my God. Oh, my
God. The Quiz just emailed.
They said to expect a call soon.
- Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
- [Jenny chuckles, shrieks]
- I'm... I'm... I'm gonna be on the show.
- And you thought I could not be Oprah.
- [chuckles]
- Well, too bad
the Choochie's money isn't real.
You'd be flying around the
world like Mary Poppins
- with that gigantic unnecessary bag.
- Mm-hmm.
- Well...
- [Anne] What?
Um. I lied about the
Choochie's money.
- Yeah, I know.
- No, no, no, no.
I lied about lying about
the Choochie's money.
It's totally real!
I'm getting a giant
check, just like on TV.
- I made them put that in the contract.
- But...
I'm sorry. [chuckles] Uh.
Wh... what are you saying?
Oh, I knew that the only way that
you would do this is if you thought
it was the only way.
Life coaching.
Yeah, but we could've paid off the
debt and I could have Linguini back.
Yeah, but I told you that
the money hasn't come in yet.
Oh, my God!
- Even your lies are lies.
- I'm not lying.
You always do this.
You don't think about the
consequences of your actions.
Mr. Linguini is everything to
me, and to you, he's just a pawn.
- I thought you were trying to help me.
- I am.
I'm helping you get him back
while also seizing your destiny!
- Oh, my God, destiny isn't real!
- Yes, it is. We all have a purpose.
We just need to find it.
No. See, that's just a
lie that you tell yourself
because you're just chasing
these stupid dreams,
then blaming whatever you
can when they don't work out.
But the truth is, it's you.
You're selfish. You're reckless.
- You are just like Mom!
- Don't say that!
Just take some
responsibility for your life.
Stop being such a goddamn loser.
- [Anne groans]
- [crowd gasps]
You're the loser!
- Yes, I am lonely and currently unhoused...
- [speaks indistinctly]
and my life hasn't turned
out exactly the way I wanted.
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to be an Asian woman in this country?
[crowd murmuring]
- Oh, my God!
- [Jenny] But at least I've lived!
What have you done
with your life?
I mean, you just, like,
hide out in your robot house
just while watching the
Quiz, watching the Quiz.
Yeah, and take care of Mom and
lend you money, and support myself.
I am responsible for everything!
- Excuse me, ladies, if you don't mind...
- Fuck off, Ben Franklin!
- [crowd gasps]
- I absolutely will.
You're the older sister,
you're supposed to help me.
But you never have, you were never
there. All you care about is yourself!
That is not true. I was
always looking out for you.
Yeah? When?
In Burbank! When you
shit in the goddamn hole!
You didn't bury it deep enough.
So, the next day,
when So-Yung and Na-Yung and
I got back from Starbucks...
Appa said you can live with
us and you can come with me
to UCLA next year!
- And we can start our fashion line!
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Jenny!
[Jin] Uh. Guys.
- Come here. You gotta see this.
- [Jenny] Cousin Jin found it.
- [Na-Yung] Ew!
- [So-Yung] Tiger, did you do this?
- How could that come out of Tiger?
- [So-Yung] Well, then who did it?
[Jenny] I knew right
away it was you.
And it was just a matter of
time before they figured it out.
So, I told them I did it.
[all, in slow motion] Ew!
Uncle Joon was gonna let us
live with them in Burbank
'cause Mom was, like, on a bender.
But everything changed after that.
I mean, do... do you know how insane
an 18-year-old would have to be
to shit in a hole?
[crowd murmuring]
Why didn't you tell me?
Because you were eight.
[somber music playing]
- Asshole!
- [crowd murmuring]
[footsteps receding]
Anne, where is my 100 bucks?
- [sobs, sniffles]
- [Francine] Anne...
You... you... you...
you wanna come in?
- [sobs, sniffles]
- [Francine] Come on.
- [kettle whistling]
- [cutlery clattering]
- [Francine] Here.
- [cutlery clattering]
[grunts]
I didn't know you were
a Pee-wee Herman fan.
Who the hell is Pee-wee Herman?
P... Uh.
That's Alan Cumming from The Good
Wife. Such a wonderful actor.
And that Scottish accent
of his. [chuckles]
That's not Alan Cumming, that's
P... That's Paul Reubens.
He plays Pee-wee... Herman.
I think I would know who
my favorite actor is,
thank you very much.
That is Alan Cumming.
Mm-hmm.
So, what's wrong with you?
I just...
I thought I was happy.
And maybe I wasn't.
I've just been so scared.
You know, scared of... of
being judged, being laughed at.
When I was younger, I
wasted so much energy
trying to get people to like me.
And for what? Hmm?
So, I could get invited to
some potluck dinner party?
- And terrible games of charades?
- Ugh. I hate charades.
Oh, I love charades. I
am an excellent guesser.
So long as the person who's acting
out the clues is not a total imbecile,
- which they usually are.
- [scoffs]
I've been alive a long time.
I've met a lot of people.
I only liked one.
Was it me?
No. You get too much mail.
The point is... [sighs] you
don't want to waste time
looking for happiness
in other people...
because happiness...
happiness... does not exist.
- Mm-hmm.
- [cellphone ringing]
Oh! Judge Judy.
[announcer over TV] Next up,
she's the voice you trust.
[chuckles]
- [indistinct chatter]
- [cellphone ringing]
- Hello?
- [Mercedes] Hi!
We wanna put Anne on Can't Stop
the Quiz. Can she fly out ASAP?
Um. I'm sorry. I'm no
longer part of her journey.
So, you'll have to
call her directly.
[Mercedes] Um. I'm sorry,
journey? Where is she go...
- [indistinct chatter]
- [keyboards clicking]
- [telephone ringing]
- Internal auditing.
[Mercedes] Hi! Is this Anne Yum?
Yes.
This is Mercedes from the Quiz.
Great news! We'd love
to have you on the show!
- Any chance you could fly out tonight?
- Tonight?
- Okay. You’re gonna regret...
- [Mercedes] Yeah, I know it's last minute...
I'm telling you...
[Mercedes] ...but we'd love to
capitalize on the buzz from your video.
[Anne] I can't really
hear you. Hold on one sec.
- Oh, my God. Obsessed with the neti pot.
- I got you one for Christmas for a reason.
- [shushes]
- God!
Uh. Do you guys, like, have to eat
here? Or, like, is there another...
- This is our spot, Fran.
- Yeah, it's kinda great.
‘Cause then the food
smell stays over here,
- not at our desks.
- Yeah. I know, I know.
- No one's here, like... [laughs]
- [Marge] Yeah.
- [Trav] You're sweating.
- [Marge] It's really spicy.
[Mercedes] Hello?
- Sorry about that, I just...
- [Mercedes] And we need the information
for whoever you wanna bring
- as your partner.
- [Marge laughing]
[Anne] I'm so sorry about that. I just
had... Sorry, one second. I just...
[Marge] Like, I'm, like, dripping,
my back is dripping sweat.
- [indistinct chatter]
- Hey!
I am sick of being treated like
some silent, invisible man.
I exist! And I know that you guys
don't see me around the office.
But you're gonna see me
tomorrow night on television.
- Book it, Mercedes!

Yes, Annie is an anxious,
sweaty little weirdo,
but she is my sister.

Francine.
Hi. I... have a plus one.
So glad you all
found the place okay.
Now, if you'll follow me, I'll
show you to the green room.
I don't care what color it is as
long as there's a chair in it.
[chuckles] For sure. And, Anne, we're
gonna get you into hair and makeup.

You're all mic'd up.

Getting closer.
Get away from my makeup. Just
kidding. Hi, I'm Ron. How are you?
Nice to meet you. I'd
shake your hand but...
- Anyway. How was your flight? Great?
- [sighs]
- Great. Listen, I want to apologize.
- [crew member 1] Big night, Ron.
- [crew member 2] You got this!
- Why?
Uh. Well, because... Well, you're
obviously a huge fan of the show,
and I just think it's a bummer
that you finally get to be here,
and tonight's gonna be all
about me winning the 84th game,
becoming the longest running champion.
I'm very sorry. It's very unfair to you.
Do you wanna be Terry?
Is that why you're always tryna act nice
'cause you wanna take over the show?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. [chuckles] Terry
is beloved by the entire world.
I'd be insane to try to
think I could fill his shoes.
- [gasps]
- [Ron] And I'm not pretending to be nice.
I really am nice.
Ask anybody here.
- I'm nice.
- [crew member 3] Sure thing, Ron.
[Ron] Well, anyhow,
I'll let you get to it.
I know you gotta get
through hair and makeup.
I already went through
hair and makeup.
Well, then you missed a spot. And
I'll let you change and, uh...
Hey! Speak of the
devil, or the angel.
- [uplifting music playing]
- Hi, Anne. I'm Terry.
Welcome to the show.

- [bell dinging]
- ninth, glimpsed, sculpts...
- [breathes heavily] Good.
- Goonch, twelfth.
- "Goonch." Oh...
- [bell ringing]
- [audience applauding]
God, I wish I had a service dog up
here. Hey, how about it, everybody?
- [chants] "Ron's dog! Ron's dog!"
- [audience member coughing]
Playable characters in
Mario Kart 64. This is fun.
- Mario, Luigi...
- [bell dinging]
- Princess Peach, for the women...
- [women cheering]
- Donkey Kong, and uh, Koopa Troopa.
- [buzzer buzzing]
- [laughs] Bowser, moron.
- [bar patron 1] You suck, Ron!
Cruciferous vegetables.
- Broccoli, cauliflower, horseradish, kale...
- [bell dinging]
cabbage, kohlrabi, bok choy.
- Beethoven, Mozart...
- [bell dinging]
- [sneezes]
- Salieri, Strauss.
- [buzzer buzzing]
- Right. He's Romantic era,
which one could argue
still is classical music.
Anyhow, now, may I, uh...
- [Mr. Linguini groans]
- Come here. Oh...
- Okay. [chuckles]
- [Terry] Hmm.
- Hide and seek. Haydn!
- [Anne chuckling]
- [bell dinging, chiming]
- [Ron] It works!
- Such a jerk.
- And for the bonus round, simple machines.
- Lever, pulley, wedge, screw...
- [bell dinging]
wheel and axle, inclined plane.
And that's all of them! You
finished with 24 seconds remaining,
which means you get a bonus
of 12,000 dollars. I
believe that's a new record.
- Is that right?
- [Terry] Can we check on that?
- [crew members] Yeah.
- Checking. What is that?
I don't... It is? It is!
- [audience cheering]
- [Terry] That is the highest bonus
in the history of the show.
- Way to go, Annie!
- [Terry] Congratulations, Anne!
- [bell dinging]
- Whoo!
- Oh, huzzah!
- [Anne] Thank you.
[Terry] What a comeback.
This is just like the
classic sports film,
Mighty Ducks 2."Ducks
fly together."
What a wonderful message.
Have you seen it?
- I've seen it multiple times.
- Oh...
Yes, it's in my top ten.
It might be my top two.
I think it's my number one.
Will the comeback continue,
or will another record be broken
tonight by Ron winning his 84th game?
It all depends on
the final round.
- Time for the flip.
- [audience applauding]
[Terry] Ron, you
have the honors.
[upbeat music playing]
[Ron] Whoo! Flip it! [grunts]
[audience] Ten,
nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four,
three, two, one!
[thudding]
- [audience] Show it!
- Oh...
- [audience cheering, applauding]
- Charades.
When we return, Anne and Ron
will compete in "Show It."
- [chuckles]
- [Glenn] And we're out.
"Show It" is where
Heacock becomes a peacock.
Bart.
- Hmm.
- How are you, buddy?
- All right, let's get in sync here.
- Okay.
[both vocalize]
- Oh, no. [coughs, grunts]
- Oh, no. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
No, I'm fine. It just
got down the wrong pipe.
- [Anne] Uh-huh.
- [grunts]
- I always thought you ate crackers...
- [Terry] No.
- Between the commercials.
- You caught me. [chuckles]
My wife, Cecilia, worries
about my sugar intake,
so, I just... I just
say they're crackers.
[chuckles] What are
you hiding from, huh?
I don't know what
I'm doing. [chuckles]
All those...
people watching and...
I'm gonna lose.
[sighs, clicks tongue]
You know... [smacks lips, sighs]
whenever I look at this
bow tie right here,
it makes me think of one contestant
from that night, Oscar from Texas.
We had a wonderful conversation
about how he makes his own jams.
He tries these wild combinations,
like blueberry rhubarb.
What? [chuckles] And he's
like an artist, but with jams.
Oh! This was the night
that Aparna from New Jersey
played her mandolin for us
during the commercial break.
And that night, Mike from Maine
brought me a snowball in a cooler
‘cause he... he remembered that I had
said I... I missed New England winters.
Great guy. None of them
actually won their games.
You know, like most contestants, they
were just here for one night, but...
I don't think of
them as failures.
I'm just glad I got a
chance to talk to them,
and they... they got
a chance to play.
Don't ruin what might
be your only night here
by making it about
winning or losing.
Just try to think of
what you wanna remember.
As for me...
no matter who wins...
this one will always remind
me of Anne from Pennsylvania
who brought her dog.
- There you are. We need you on stage.
- Yeah, right away, Glenn.
- Thank you so much.
- [Glenn sighs]
It's Glenn's world and we're
all just living in it, you know?
- [chuckles]
- [Terry] All right. Ready?
- [sighs]
- [intriguing music playing]
And legally, you have to allow
service animals, but also,
- it's the right thing to do, you know?
- [crowd cheering, applauding]
And you know what? Not only for
Anne, but for society, as well.
[Mercedes] Sure, it's just that
it's clearly a fake vest, so...
[Jenny] I know, but what side
of history do you wanna be on?
[Mercedes] Okay, you
can't pull that with me.
You know what? I think it's probably
gonna be really great for ratings.
- You know what?
- I wanna change my partner.
- What?
- What?
I wanna play with my sister.
- Jenny.
- [Glenn] You can't do that.
- Glenn, it's her game. I think she can.
- [Jenny] What? Uh.
You want me to guess? But
I don't know anything.
You know me.
And... and win or lose, we'll...
we'll... we'll do it together.
- [Glenn] All right. Switch them.
- I came all this way.
- I know, Fran. I'm so sorry about that.
- Ma'am, this way.
Um. If I could get you and
Mr. Linguini to a seat?
- [Anne] Sorry, Francine.
- [Francine] Now, I have to watch
the rest of this shit.
She can't do that. You
can't switch partners.
This is so unfair.
What are you gonna do next?
Give her all the answers?
- Welcome back.
- [clears throat]
I hope you enjoyed your break.
Joining us for the final
round is Ron's friend, Bart,
and Anne's sister... I'm
sorry, I never got your name.
Oh, Jenny.
- [Terry] Hi, Jenny, I'm Terry.
- Oh, hello, Satan.
Ron and Bart are up first,
so we'll ask Anne and Jenny
to step on the "Show It" coin.
Gentlemen, take your
places. Best of luck.
[Ron] I'm ready, Terry.
- And your time starts now.
- [bell dinging]
- [timer ticking]
- Book. Magazine. Mag.
- Shopping. Cart. Mag.
- He's good.
- Cart. Magna Carta. Hmm.
- [bell dinging]
- [audience cheering, applauding]

- [audience applauding]
- [bell dinging]
- Kombucha!
- [Bart] Apple cider vinegar.
- Oh.
- [bell dinging]
Woman. Thatch.
Margaret Thatcher.
- [bell chiming]
- Hmm.
[Terry] And that's your time.
Ron, you got seven correct,
which brings your total
- to a whopping 61,000.
- [bell dinging]
- Whoo! Heck yeah, bro. Whoo!
- [Bart] Hmm.
But one thing stands
between you and victory.
Well, actually two,
Anne and Jenny.
- [Ron] Oh, boy.
- [Terry] Come on up. Let's switch places.
- [crowd cheering, applauding]
- Beat that.
- [grunts]
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- [Ron] What? What?
- [Bart] Hmm.
- [chuckles]
- [Terry] Anne? Jenny?
- Yeah?
- You need at least nine in order to win.
- Okay. [inhales]
- [Terry] And your time starts now.
- [bell dinging]
- [timer ticking]
[breathes heavily] Okay, okay,
okay, thinking, thinking.
Um. Um. A gathering. Uh. You have
a... You... you... you have some...
Uh. A... an ear... ear... ear...
earache, earring, earring.
A gun in my ear? Earring gun.
"I can't hear," you're deaf.
Uh. Okay, not... No. Don't... Not
that. Um. A flying... a flying duck.
A duck... a duck. Uh.
Something is moving. What?
What? Do... do something else.
You're in jail, you can't get out.
You're The Hamburglar.
- [audience laughing]
- This is pathetic.
- [groans]
- [Jenny] Do something else!
Just do something else!
Uh. It's a... [inhales]
- Uncle Dong?
- [audience murmuring]
Okay, Uncle Dong, Uncle
Dong. Uncle... Stock market.
[bell dinging]
Um. [chuckles] Okay.
Um. Me? Me? Praying.
I'm praying, I'm
praying. Uh-huh. Okay.
- And Kristi Yamaguchi!
- Yes.
- [bell dinging]
- Yes.
[audience cheering, applauding]
Looking at a house.
Okay, me, me, me, me.
- Ketchup! [chuckles]
- [bell dinging]
- [audience gasping]
- What?
Uh. Gross, gross. You, me,
gross. Oh! The Beatles.
- [bell dinging]
- Yeah. Okay, uh, you, uh, banana.
- [chuckles] Glue stick! Glue stick!
- [bell dinging]
Oh, yeah, that's... that's
me! That's cheesecake!
I like it too.
Uh. The... the sad dog
from, uh, Homeward Bound.
- Shadow. Yes! Yes!
- [bell dinging]
[crowd cheering, applauding]
- Taking out the trash!
- [bell dinging]
- [both laugh]
- [audience laughing]
- [Jenny] Yes!
- That... that was good.
- Very good.
- [shushes]
[audience member 1]
Come on, Quiz Lady!

Okay. [breathes heavily]
You are just, uh, so flinging.
Oh, you're gonna be strong.
You are... Muscle. Muscle. Muscle.
You're like muscle... muscle lady.
Muscle. What? Oh, oh, oh, oh! Muscle.

Digging a hole, digging

Shoot in a hole? Shoot in a

- Whoo!
- [crowd cheering, applauding]
Quiz Lady is my best friend.
- [cheers, screams] My God!
- No! No! No!
I'm very sorry, Terry. I'm very
sorry to do this, everybody.
- She cheated.
- What?
You brought in a dog, you changed
partners at the last second.
They use some kind of
ancient Chinese mind meld.
- [gasps] Actual racism.
- Just be honest with me, Terry.
You're threatened by me.
You wanted me to lose?
He wanted me to lose.
- [audience murmuring]
- Just lose with honor.
I can't... I can't... I can't. I am
exciting. I'm fresh. I'm popping. I'm young.
- And you're just a boring old man.
- [audience gasping]
- [Ron] Acting like you invented...
- [gasps]
the bow tie. [chuckles]
[over TV] I'll keep going.
- [audience booing over cellphone]
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
- Yeah, I will say...
- I think you should stop.
In fact, I think you
should buzz off, Ron.
- [audience cheering, applauding]
- [Mr. Linguini grunts]
- Ooh!
- Would a boring old man say that?
Congratulations, Anne,
you're our new Quiz Champion!
[cheering, applauding]
[sentimental music playing]
I'm sorry, Terry.
No. I... I... Yeah.
[cheers]
Anne! Anne! Anne!
- [audience] Anne! Anne! Anne!
- [Terry] Join us tomorrow
for another night of fast
facts and live learning.
I'm Terry McTeer, and
I'll be right... Oh!
I'll be right here.
Have a good night.
[cheers, laughs] You did it!
- We did it.
- Win! Win!
- You bring me all this way...
- [chuckles]
on the promise that I might get
a chance to play charades...
- [sighs]
- and it was all just a... charade.
Hey, if you're gonna be this
miserable, can you just, like, die?
- Don't.
- 'Cause you're ruining her moment.
Oh, moment. Look at the two of you,
running around, searching for happiness.
It's just deranged.
Just accept the fact that
nothing will make life better.
- Life is, and always has been a... a...
- [golf cart's horn honking]
[breathes shakily] ...a miracle.
[traditional folk music playing]
It's... it's... it's...
it's, uh, it... it's...
- Who?
- [Anne] So sorry to bother you.
- She's a huge fan of yours.
- [Francine whimpering]
Uh. Maybe you can give her
a ride in your golf cart.
- Uh.
- Sh... she's gonna die soon.
- And she has this horrible disease...
- It's...
where her intestines grow like an
invasive weed. It's everywhere.
- They kinda...
- Yeah, yeah, fine. Hop in.
- [Francine gasps]
- She also thinks
you're the Scottish actor, Alan
Cumming. Just play along with that.
[Francine] You're
excellent in The Good Wife.
You're so, so excellent.
- Ooh! What a bonnie lass.
- [chuckles] Oh, my God!
[Paul laughing]
- Who was that?
- [Paul] Play that bagpipe!
- Not Alan Cumming.
- [Paul] Oh, me pot o' gold. Lucky Charms!
That was a bloody good
pudding. Glengarry... [laughs]
[gasps] Oh! Look at it.
Oh! It's so beautiful.
[sighs]
[Jenny] Where's
Burbank from here?
I think it's over
there by the mountains.
[Jenny] Wow!
I always thought my
destiny was out there.
Maybe it is.
Nah.
It's just Burbank.
I'm sorry, I left
you to deal with Mom.
I'm sorry, I ruined our chance
of living with the cool cousins.
- That was not your fault.
- It was.
I mean, they always thought we
were the losers of the family.
We kind of were.
Not today.
- You're right. Not today. [chuckles]
- [laughs]
- Not today!
- Not today!
- Motherfuckers!
- Oh, okay.
[chuckles]
[geese squawking]
- I love you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [gasps] Look, geese, geese! [chuckles]
I'm sorry, what were you saying?
I love you, Jenny.
[gentle music playing]
I love you, Annie.
Thank you.
- Did you just say, "Thank you"?
- What? Yeah. Why?
Come here. Come here,
I'm touching you now.
- No!
- You can't help it.
I'm so proud of you.
[Anne sighs] Okay.
You know, I, uh, I'm gonna have
to stay in California for a while.
[Jenny] Oh! Look at the glow up.
Would you wanna stay with me?
Just ‘cause I feel like we
make a pretty good team.
Uh. Yeah! We do!
[gasps] Oh. I can finally,
like, coordinate our outfits.
I have the most amazing sleeveless
blazer, it's chartreuse.
- No.
- [Jenny] It would be very slimming.
- [Anne] I don't like sleeveless.
- [Jenny] All you have to do
- is some pushups.
- [Anne] What do you mean?
[Jenny] You should work
on your arms a little bit.
[Anne] Are you trying to say that
I'm out of shape or something?
[Jenny] Yeah.
["Growing Up" playing]
[grunts]
- [chuckles]
- [chuckles]
I can't look at...
Leave it. No, no.
Let me have it, you go away,
and let me look at it by myself.
