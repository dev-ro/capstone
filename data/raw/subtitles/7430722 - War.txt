Father, some rice?
It was delicious. I've had a lot.
Ask him.
Thanks, I'm done.
Why aren't the kids in bed?
See you tomorrow at 7am.
We'll walk together.
Yes, father.
- Be on time.
- Yes.
Cobra One to Eagle One.
Are you set?
Affirmative, Cobra One.
According to the information,
he's in the front seat.
He's due any time.
Not yet.
But I can smell him.
Farid Haqqani.
The Jihad salesman.
His speeches have lured many
innocent young men...
...to leave behind their countries
and join the Jihad.
They become obsessed
with the idea of martyrdom.
His description of heaven
would lure even a man like me.
That's why we must silence him.
Before he lures others,
send him to heaven.
We have visual, Cobra One.
Farid Haqqani. That's him.
Eagle One. Take the shot.
Roger, Cobra One.
Shoot him before he rolls up
the bulletproof window.
His window doesn't bother me...
...or this gun.
None of it bothers me.
He doesn't either.
Shoot. Dammit!
He had a gun on Farid Haqqani.
Yes, ma'am.
Tell me if I'm right, Colonel.
A shot was indeed fired,
not in Syria at Haqqani...
...but here in New Delhi at our
senior analyst V.K. Naidu.
What the hell's going on,
Colonel Luthra?
Kabir's gone rogue, ma'am.
He's joined hands with the enemy.
Who?
Haqqani? Jaesh?
Rizwan Ilyasi?
Who was the target in Syria?
We all saw the visual feed.
Who pointed the gun?
Kabir rigged the gun and camera
remotely three days earlier.
We had eyes on Haqqani...
...while he shot Naidu,
at the same time.
How the hell do you expect me
to report this to the PMO...
...without sounding like a fool?
Ma'am, you know as much as I do.
Kill him.
We must find him before he makes
another move.
You always said Kabir is our best.
There must be someone
who can outsmart him.
Here's your money, Oslav.
Where's my consignment?
Get him!
Colonel.
I've sorted Oslav and his gang.
They won't be supplying
narcotics to India anymore.
Actually, they're stopping
all drug trade.
Right, sir. I'm on my way.
Hi.
Here's a list of safe houses.
Kabir has seven passports.
But he didn't use any of them
to re-enter India.
We're checking all the flights
from Turkey to Delhi.
What guarantee he came
on an Indian passport?
Or flew from Turkey?
Agreed. But I know he's back in Delhi.
So where is he?
You forgot the key question, Colonel.
"Why?"
A man who trained us all
and who killed many traitors...
...why would he become a traitor?
Let's find out.
Saini, find him!
Report only to me.
Yes, sir.
Is there a problem?
Yes, Colonel, why Saini?
No one knows Kabir better than I do.
Khalid, he'll see you coming.
Of course, we're coming.
He knows that.
Sir, I know how he thinks.
I know his every move.
I understand him.
- You love him, Khalid.
- Not more than my country.
If you find him...
...could you shoot him?
Yes, sir.
When his motives...
Just as I feared, Khalid.
What if you never discover his motives?
You have my word. Colonel.
I'll wound him first,
then I'll do the asking.
Tell me you're joking, Colonel.
Here's his 2-year report.
He's up there with the other officers.
So?
Kabir, this is your unit.
Decide the men you want in it...
...and how to train them.
Our discussion over, sir?
I want you to have the final decision.
So I must accept your decision.
Kabir...
Khalid has shown he's the best
in any given situation.
So why don't you want him
on your mission?
There isn't one reason...
there are two reasons.
Khalid's traitor father,
Major Abdul Rahmani, shot me.
I survived.
My buddy and partner...
...who stood between Rahmani and me...
...didn't survive.
So I put a bullet through
your father's left eye.
Just to be safe...
...in his right eye too.
So with due respect, Colonel...
...why do you think I'd let
a traitor's son...
...come near me with a gun in his hand?
Permission to speak, sir?
Go on, Khalid.
My father was a traitor.
But how do you think we found out?
My mother suspected it.
She informed the army.
That's why you have a scar
on your body...
...not a shroud covering it.
My father's name is linked to mine.
But I'm my mother's son too.
She sacrificed her husband's life
for her country.
She did not regret it for a second.
Leave us, Lieutenant.
Yes, sir.
His father was a traitor.
Yet, the boy has done so well.
Can you imagine how hard
he has worked?
He has real guts.
He's hell-bent on wiping out the stain
on his family's name.
He knows you shot his father
Major Rahmani.
Yet he enlisted.
He wants you to train him...
...to prove he is not like his father.
People take the test of fire
only once, Kabir.
This soldier is willing to undergo
that test every single day.
Now it's your call.
You're in.
But you're hanging by a thin thread.
One mistake and...
All the best.
You're in hell now.
Jammu, 2009.
Kolkata, 2013.
Surat, 2015. And Hyderabad, 2017.
One man is behind all these attacks.
Rizwan Ilyasi.
India's enemy number one.
Our country is his main target.
But in the eyes of the world,
he's just a businessman.
We tried hard to convince
the international community...
...that he's a global terrorist.
But he's clever.
He knows how to cover his tracks.
In the AI 215 blast last year,
193 Indians...
...and 53 foreign nationals
were killed.
One man claimed responsibility;
Basheer Hassib.
A militant rebel commander in Iraq.
How is he connected to Rizwan Ilyasi?
They didn't have AK47s till now...
...so who gave them
anti-aircraft missiles?
He did.
Rizwan Ilyasi.
This is our mission.
Rizwan Ilyasi.
For five years I've done nothing
but track him.
Now I'll pull out all the stops,
I may kill...
...or be killed.
Which is why...
...on this mission, if anyone
screws up in any way...
...I'll take it as a personal attack.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir!
If we get Basheer and prove
his link to Ilyasi...
...no government will shelter him.
We'll lure that rat from its sewer.
Sync watches to 08:09.
Now.
Our mission is simple.
We'll enter an ISIS controlled area...
...and get Basheer Hassib...
...alive!
May peace be upon you all.
This woman has committed a crime
against Islam...
...by committing adultery.
Therefore we must establish
the authority of the Almighty...
...against this sinner
and stone her to death.
Stone her! Stone her!
Stone her! Stone her!
Stone her! Stone her!
God be praised.
You have an album of me!
You're an Indian agent...
...here on a mission. No doubt
to kill me.
Not you...
...I want your boss Ilyasi.
Give him to me?
You want Ilyasi?
You don't even know where you are.
- Three minutes to go...
- I see. And?
Your men will save you?
How do you think theyâ€™re ever find you?
You mean this? We found
this transmitter in your shoe.
You came here in one piece, Indian.
This was already in pieces.
Now I will smash you to pieces.
Found two transmitters?
Two?
One tooth is for showing,
the other tooth is for biting.
You dog, will you hit me...
...or will you run?
If missions had scorecards...
...you'd be man of the match!
Kabir will cut you some slack now.
It's not slack I want.
I want his trust.
And I want the star Katrina Kaif!
Sir, someone to see you.
Mother?
Mother?
- Salaam.
- Son.
What brings you here?
I brought you some sacred offerings
from the shrine.
Share them with your colleagues.
I prayed for their good health.
What did you ask for me?
Courage.
And for yourself?
Respect.
You give me courage, Ammi.
Inshallah, I'll never let your eyes
lower in shame again.
I've lived with eyes lowered
for 14 years, Khalid.
You give me the right to look up again.
May God grant you success.
Ammi...
...ask for courage and respect...
...and some cash.
We have bills to pay!
Khalid...
...in my office when you're done.
Yes, sir.
Sir.
Sit.
Sit.
You hid something from me, Khalid.
You missed your targets yesterday.
You didn't see them in time.
They were on your right.
You have a blind spot
in your right peripheral vision.
Don't you?
This deficiency disqualifies you.
I can't enlist you, Khalid.
I can't afford having you in my team.
But, sir...
This team is my family, Khalid.
Their safety is my responsibility.
Your handicap could cost me their lives.
You have to leave, Khalid.
Now.
So you'll let my father win again?
Excuse me?
Even this gift is thanks to him.
Traitor!
Son of a traitor!
Traitor!
Son of a traitor!
Traitor!
My eye was partially damaged.
But my courage was completely broken.
My mother refused to let me
be defeated.
She said each insult...
...each blow...
...each wound will be a reminder...
...of father's treason.
She said no one would trust me.
They'd be suspicious of me.
And if they questioned me,
I would have to justify myself.
Keep answering their questions...
...till no one dared
to question me again.
Give me a chance, sir.
I promise you...
...my eyesight may be weak...
...but not my aim.
I knew you were putting on a show
to clear your family name.
I've always known
you were a traitor's son.
Treason runs in your veins.
Even if a man can move a mountain,
he can't escape his upbringing.
I knew your game from the very start.
But I was waiting for you
to make a wrong move...
...so I could show your true colours
to the Colonel.
You've proved me wrong, Khalid.
You proved the blood in your veins
is not your father's...
...but your mother's.
I was wrong.
And I haven't been so proud
of being wrong till now.
Just promise me something...
...you'll make sure your partner
stands on your right!
Promise.
Welcome to the team, Captain Khalid.
Thank you, sir.
Dismiss.
Tell everyone at home
we'll be late tonight
So don't wait up
We've earned the right to celebrate
So forgive all my mistakes
Friends, for a handful of hours today
Let's walk the wayward path
Let's turn our backs on the world
Let's break all the rules
Out in the open
Making a sound
Drenched in red dye
Like true heroes, we'll dance
Jai Jai Shivshankar!
Carefree and wild
Let the colours fly!
Let the colours fly!
We're raring to go
Carefree and wild
Let the colours fly!
Let the colours fly!
Jai Jai Shivshankar!
Carefree and wild
Let the colours fly!
Let the colours fly!
On a sweet melody
We keep in step
Let's move to the Desi beat
Forget all your inhibitions
Remember to get tipsy
Forget all your shame
Remember to dance
No one will be spared today
Everyone will dance the night away
That's two rounds for us
Let bank notes fly!
Let's get drunk and be merry
Like heroes, we'll dance
Jai Jai Shivshankar!
Carefree and wild
Let the colours fly!
Let the colours fly!
We're raring to go
Carefree and wild
Let the colours fly!
Let the colours fly!
Jai Jai Shivshankar!
Carefree and wild
Let the colours fly!
Let the colours fly!
Jai Jai Shivshankar!
Carefree and wild
Jai Jai Shivshankar!
Carefree and wild
Let the colours fly!
Let the colours fly!
Our plan has worked.
Arresting Basheer has flushed
the rat from its sewer.
Rizwan is in Marrakesh.
But only for a day.
If he leaves who knows when
we'd get another chance.
Flight?
The plane's on the runway.
Your gear's on board.
Sir, anyone informed about the mission?
Not yet.
I'm calling the Defence Minister.
No, sir.
Ilyasi always manages to escape.
Someone must be tipping him off.
I'd like to maintain radio silence
on this one, sir.
I want all your phones.
Now.
No calls and no contacts. Got it?
Yes, sir!
Let's go get him, sir!
All the best.
The Abuddin General is at my 10 o'clock.
Sir, I see a black car approaching.
His security.
He'll be here at any moment.
Be ready.
All set, sir.
Everyone's in position.
He'll go inside the restaurant...
...but we'll drag him out.
Alive.
Target acquired, sir. It's Ilyasi.
Aditi, keep my count.
10...

Don't move.
Hello, Ilyasi.
Stand up!
Your next dinner is in India.
I'm not hungry.
But thanks for the invite.
You'll be hungry and thirsty
soon enough.
Now walk!
When will you guys finally get it?
You Indian agents have been trying
to catch me for years.
You'll try forever, Major Kabir.
It's game over, Ilyasi.
Game over.
Really?
Ask your team.
All your team members may not agree.
Watch out on your right, sir!
Khalid, let him go!
Khalid, we need Ilyasi.
Back me up, Khalid.
We need Ilyasi.
Khalid!
What do experts say?
The local search team has covered
a 50km radius, sir.
They're asking to stop
the surveillance.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Easy, Kabir.
Ilyasi?
Ilyasi?
We lost him.
No, no, no!
Check the checkpoints.
It happened a week ago.
Khalid ran after Saurabh.
He chased him for 20 minutes.
The transmitters were in range...
...then we lost signal.
We combed every inch of the area.
No sign of Khalid or Saurabh.
- I think the sea swallowed them.
- I trust Khalid's survival skills.
Until we find Khalid's body,
we'll keep looking.
Call an ambulance.
I killed that traitor Saurabh.
You got him?
Ilyasi?
Next time.
Next time.
Next time.
I'm proud of you, Khalid.
Khalid.
Who's the team-leader?
Who do you think?
I think the Colonel has wasted time
putting Saini in-charge.
You tracing the call?
Come on, Khalid.
You know it's going to bounce...
...from Istanbul to Hong Kong,
to Nairobi.
- Wanna go on a world tour?
- Sir...
- Still "sir"?
- I was wondering that too.
How did I get you wrong, sir?
No, Khalid.
You're not wrong at all.
I shot Naidu.
He was the first on my list.
And the last.
Before you get to someone else...
...I'll get to you.
Then remember what I taught you,
Khalid.
Shoot if you get the chance.
Don't hesitate.
I wouldn't.
You taught me another thing, sir.
"Your country comes first...
...second...
...and last."
Should I remember that too?
You won't have the time to forget.
I'll spell it out.
If you come between me
and my target...
...it's game over.
What's the plan?
There's no point now, Khalid.
Tell you what...
...keep our flag ready.
We'll wrap his body in it.
Sir?
Find this.
What do you want? Let go!
Let go!
Can you fly?
- No.
- So why ask me to let go?
Did they work together? Were they
at the Academy?
No, sir. They had no clue
about each other.
No connection between Naidu and Shroff.
There was one.
Kabir shot them both. Who's next?
You? Me? The PM?
I'm on it, sir.
- If only someone could find him...
- If? Dammit, Khalid!
In this age of cameras, satellites,
biometrics...
...can't he be found?
And for God's sake,
why is he doing all this?
Must more bullets fly before
we find the answer?
What's his motive?
I'm trying to find that out, sir.
Warning. Pickpockets operating
in the area.
Salaam, Khalid.
Too late.
These innocent bystanders...
You should've shot me on sight.
Your conscience will stop you now.
Why, sir? Why are you doing this?
You were like a God to me.
We are strange, Khalid.
For us even an idol is God.
And if an idol breaks, we ask
how could God break?
You are not an idol, sir.
You're human.
You didn't break...
...you just fell off your pedestal.
Redeem yourself.
Some advice for you too, Khalid.
Stop chasing me.
I don't want your mother to see you
six feet under.
So, please...
Get out of my way.
You know that's impossible, sir.
I can't forget my country
to save my skin.
You taught me everything I know...
...except for treason.
One thing is true...
...whether my mother sees me
buried or not...
...I promise you...
...no one will mourn your death.
If you're so sure of yourself...
...then I'll give you a choice.
I can tell you my motive...
Or...
I don't want to know.
Or I'll tell you my next target.
Dammit, sir.
Not "sir" any more, Khalid.
Not "sir" any more.
Who or why, Khalid?
Who? Or why?
Next station, Karol Bagh.
You want the reason?
Or save a life?
Who? Or why?
Doors open to the left.
Quick! The next stop's mine.
Who?
Lion! Lion!
And it's a goal!
Lion House 1, Panther House nil.
And it's a goal!
Come on.
Lions have taken the match!
Congratulations Lions!
Well done, Ruhi! Really well done.
What "Well done?" Kabir, we lost!
So?
What's the point of playing?
The point?
Seriously!
Is that what they teach you at school?
Winning is everything?
But I don't like losing, Kabir.
I fully agree.
When you play a match,
you should play to win.
Run fast, play hard,
challenge your opponent.
But when the match is over...
...don't think: "Did I win or lose?"
Ask yourself instead: "Did I give it
my very best?"
And if your answer is "yes,"
then you're a winner.
What would happen if everyone
thought like that?
There'd be fewer sad people.
Remember, Ruhi...
...no one can be number one forever.
One day or another, you'll be defeated.
That's OK.
Has anyone defeated you?
Mama?
Yes. Naina.
In the sun and sand,
the sea in the night
And I'm feeling all right,
feeling all right
Why waste time?
Let's not hold ourselves back
Sleep will not be ours tonight
Though our dreams will be fulfilled
We have no need of lifetime vows
Let them be unfulfilled
Just for this once
Hold me close tonight
Hear me just for tonight
You danced and danced
Till your dancing bells came undone
Till your dancing bells came undone
Throwing inhibitions to the wind
I danced my heart away
Till my dancing bells came undone
Till my dancing bells came undone
Love rules just for a day
Tomorrow love may not be mine
Though our hearts beat together now
They may not be one forever
Let us lose ourselves
in this moment
Our love may not last for eternity
What point are lifelong vows?
Let them be unfulfilled
Just for this once
Hold me close tonight
Take me by the hand tonight
I danced my heart away
Till my dancing bells came undone
Till my dancing bells came undone
Till my dancing bells came undone
Till my dancing bells came undone
Naina, you have to see this!
Let me guess. Firoze Contractor?
Last time he sent earrings,
now it's the whole set.
If I keep refusing his gifts,
he'll give me the showroom next.
He hasn't missed a single show.
Every night, centre table.
He's only asking for one dinner date.
Go on. Say yes!
If the necklace was the starter,
the main course is not for me.
Thank him and return his gift.
You're in a hurry these days.
Have you met someone?
Naina.
You scoundrel! You didn't tell me.
Who is it? Someone special?
"Someone special." Unlikely.
But he's nice.
You're looking happy after ages.
Does he know about Ruhi?
No.
He's not that close to me.
Taking it step by step.
Give it back!
Sir.
- What news, Kabir?
- Nothing at all, sir.
Maybe our Intel is wrong.
Stay focused, Kabir.
Firoze Contractor is no diamond
merchant based in Antwerp.
Our Intel is right. He's laundering
Rizwan Ilyasi's money.
No one wants to catch him
more than I do.
Sir, don't worry.
I won't let you down, sir.
And I will never stop.
I lost my team in Marrakesh
because of Ilyasi.
Pratik, Muthu.
Ilyasi has gone underground since.
No trace of him.
This is our first lead to Rizwan
in three months.
Better keep an eye on Contractor
till his friend shows up.
Sure, sir.
If he greets a passer-by even,
Aditi will do a background check.
His conversations?
Constantly recording, sir.
Before he arrived, his villa was bugged.
Cameras and mics.
Someone to see you.
One second, sir.
His accountant is here.
Seems a little urgent.
- I'll get back to you, sir.
- OK.
Transfer the 6.5 million
from the last deal...
...to these four anonymous
bank accounts.
All right, sir.
Sir, may I say something?
These four accounts belong
to Ilyasi's men, right?
Sir, he's a liability now.
All his accounts and assets
have been frozen.
What if the CIA or Indian Intelligence
track us?
So you believe Rizwan Ilyasi is finished?
Many people have made the same
mistake for over 20 years.
They imagine Rizwan Ilyasi's
time is up. He's finished. Over.
But he always comes back.
Do you play chess?
Say you're playing with four extra
pieces that are invisible.
Rook, Knight, Bishop and Pawn.
And your opponent doesn't know it.
Can you ever be defeated?
These four bank accounts
are his invisible chess pieces.
All powerful people. All at the top.
The Indian Army, the Government,
Intelligence.
As long as they are in play,
no one can checkmate Rizwan.
So he can attack whenever
he wants. And he will.
Soon there'll be a big explosion
in India.
Osama Bin Laden will be history.
This attack will cost the earth.
I could retire on the commission alone.
- So, get going with this.
- Sure, sir.
Make the transfers first thing.
I leave Italy tomorrow.
That's how I lost in love
That's how I lost in love
That's how you lost in love
That's how you lost in love
That's how I lost in love
That's how I lost in love
That's how I lost in love
Great session, guys!
- Bye.
- Thank you.
True enterprising Indian!
One job is not enough. I need
to make a lot of money quickly.
What's wrong?
I know that look.
Someone was lying and must now
tell the truth.
Let me guess. You forgot
to say you're married.
Girlfriend?
Your Mummy has found you a bride.
Boyfriend?
There must be something.
Yeah.
Is my heart gonna break?
Maybe.
So it was all lies, Kabir.
Friendship, love, connection.
All of it.
You were just using me.
Firoze has been crazy about you
for a long time, Naina.
I needed you...
...as a backup.
In our world, you're known
as "a civilian asset."
So was I your civilian asset?
That's all?
Think about Ruhi.
So you know about her too?
She's been at boarding school
for 6 years. No father.
Her mother has been dancing
the world over...
...to save up dollars and euros
so that one day...
...they can both live together.
I can make your three-year plan...
...work in a day, Naina.
It's a good deal.
Kabir. Or whatever your real name is...
...are you married?
Obviously, you don't have any kids.
That's why it's easy for you
to propose this deal to me.
My only ties are to my country, Naina.
I'm an Indian soldier.
First and foremost.
You're an army officer's daughter...
...so I thought you'd understand.
Your research is pretty solid.
Not everyone is a soldier.
Nor has everyone vowed to save India.
Some people just try to provide...
...a happy and simple life
for their children.
For ordinary people like me
this is our daily battle.
Trust me, Naina, if I had an option,
I wouldn't have come to you.
There's only one day left.
Firoze leaves tomorrow.
He's my only link to India's
most dangerous enemy, Ilyasi.
Ilyasi has murdered
many innocent people.
He won't stop.
And if he is not stopped,
he will destroy India.
Coming for the Sports Day?
All the parents were here
on Painting Day except you.
So sorry, Ruhi, I couldn't make it.
But you know what? Sister Mary
sent me your painting.
I thought it was brilliant.
I carry it with me everywhere.
I'm coming on Sports Day,
with all your gifts.
Really?
Thank you, Mama. Bye.
I'll talk to you later.
I'm getting late for my music class.
- I love you, my sweet. Bye!
- Love you, Mama.
Sister Mary, is Ruhi all right?
She's a very bright child, Naina.
Very studious and good at sports.
But she misses you terribly.
Try and find more time for her.
I'm trying.
I'm working on it.
Thank you.
I have no idea if this is a patriot
talking or a desperate mother...
...but I'm on, Kabir.
What must I do?
I promise you.
You'll be safe.
I don't trust you, Kabir.
A loner like you who has no family
cannot be trusted.
But I can't walk away from your deal.
I promise you, Naina.
I won't let you come to any harm.
I can read it in your eyes that
you're a loyal soldier.
Every soldier has someone they long
to go home to.
But you've chosen
the path of martyrdom.
Can a martyr be trusted with a life?
Find someone to go home to, Kabir.
You'll start believing in relationships.
Naina and Ruhi surfing in Australia.
Ruhi's dream holiday.
It'll remind you â€“ Naina, your civilian
asset, is not alone with Firoze...
...the 6-year-old Ruhi is with her too.
I'll take the picture back
when your job is done.
Naina.
Firoze never parts with his laptop.
He has a private network.
Connect this drive to his laptop
when you get the chance.
30 seconds.
The drive will copy all his data.
I'll know his next plans and the
identity of his invisible chess pieces.
Going somewhere?
Yes. This is my last night here.
Destiny smiles on me.
- Wine?
- Sure.
A bottle of ChÃ¢teau Latour, please.
1978.
Come.
Yeah.
Sir?
Minister Sherna has decided, Kabir...
...if there's no progress,
you're coming back tomorrow.
Colonel, I'll call you first thing.
I'm in the middle of an operation.
What?
It's a honey trap.
There's a girl Firoze has been trying
to date for months.
She's connecting our drive
to his laptop.
Good work.
Send me the report immediately, Kabir.
Not tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
- Not now, Aditi.
- It's urgent.
OK, what?
Contractor's girls.
There's an odd one out.
OK.
Many are high-end models,
exotic dancers and actresses.
Between 15 and 25.
- Who's the odd one out?
- A 40-year-old doctor.
So?
She's among the world's leading
plastic surgeons.
She runs a clinic in Zurich.
Only millionaires can afford her.
OK. I'll check the video.
Name and date?
Dr. Malika Singhal,
12th March, 7pm.
12th March, 7pm.
OK. Putting you on speaker.
Yeah, sure.
You take the first left.
And the left after that. OK?
Thank you.
Very nice.
Your face has the right blood supply.
What can I say? Blood is rushing
to every part of my body, doctor!
Careful!
Firoze Contractor was not so flirty.
If you behave out of character,
people will get suspicious.
With your new face, your personality
must change too.
For me and the world...
...you are now Firoze Contractor.
With your new face, your personality
must change too.
For me and the world...
...you are now Firoze Contractor.
Sir, I hacked Dr. Malika's
hospital server.
I found some important information.
You must see it.
Firoze is...
...Rizwan Ilyasi!
Lost something?
What a mistake, darling.
That laptop does not belong
to Firoze Contractor.
It belongs to Rizwan Ilyasi.
Anyone who happens to see Rizwan...
...is soon awaited in Heaven.
I promise you, I won't let
any harm come to you.
I don't trust you, Kabir.
It'll remind you â€“ Naina, your civilian
asset is not alone with Firoze...
...the 6-year-old Ruhi is with her too.
Sir, you've stayed silent for days.
You should update the Colonel.
The Colonel was the only one aware
that Naina was with Firoze.
And ten minutes later, she was dead.
Do you think the Colonel...?
Rook, Knight, Bishop and Pawn.
I cannot trust anyone till these
four invisible pieces are found.
But how will you find them?
- Will you help me?
- Of course, sir.
Background checks.
You mean the Colonel?
Anyone else?
Who did the Colonel call
after he and I spoke on the phone?
I'll check his tax records
and bank accounts.
Credit cards don't pay
for treason, Aditi.
Dig up something else.
Have any of his friends benefitted
recently? Or...
- Know what I mean?
- Yes.
If I find something,
what will you do?
V.K. Naidu.
The Colonel spoke to him
2 minutes after your call.
And?
Very suspicious.
He has anonymous bank accounts,
properties...
...and cash gifts from Indians abroad.
Someone is keeping him in luxury.
We took our eyes off him.
Thanks, Aditi.
I have my eye on him now.
Kabir!
You.
Rizwan has four chess pieces.
You're one of them.
You're mistaken.
Who are the other three?
I swear, Kabir, I don't know what
you're talking about.
Bishop. Rook. Knight. Pawn.
Kabir, please.
I'm losing a lot of blood.
I want an ambulance.
Rook, Knight, Pawn.
Then I'll call an ambulance.
Not three. There are only two others.
Who?
I only know the man I report to.
Name, Naidu? I need a name.
Shroff!
Jimmy Shroff.
Lt. Col. Jimmy Shroff.
Did you tell him about Naina?
Kabir, give me a chance to explain.
I will.
In hell.
Who are Ilyasi's two other chess pieces
besides Naidu?
Not two. There's only one.
- Name?
- Biswas. Dr. Utpal Biswas.
What's Rizwan's next move?
I was told to hand over a drive from
Biswas to Rizwan. That's all I know.
Let me go!
You'll have to memorize the formulas...
...and then explain it to people here.
Most of them haven't
really understood...
Dr. Utpal Biswas,
ISRO's chief for 9 years.
A key member of the Garuda
Defence Satellite launch team.
Awarded the highest government honours...
...even considered for a Nobel prize.
The Colonel rang me.
But I don't understand why.
I don't know him.
Your safety is my responsibility
till we learn more.
What's all this?
- I need to make some calls.
- No calls.
You can't talk to anyone
till we get to India.
All right.
Come in.
- Lunch.
- Yes, please.
Hello.
I need the codes.
They're ready.
We have a problem.
They're taking me to Delhi
under tight security.
"Delhi's still far away."
Meaning?
It's Persian for "Delhi's still far away."
Oh no!
Bring the chopper!
Who are you?
Where's Ilyasi?
No idea.
- Who's the Pawn?
- What?
I've killed two men, doctor.
What's a third to me!
Naidu, Shroff and you.
Who is Ilyasi's fourth man?
No fourth man.
If there was one...
...only Rizwan Ilyasi knows who he is.
I've never known Rizwan's whereabouts.
Where's the drive?
Where's the drive?
Here.
Suspect on the bridge.
Suspect on the bridge.
Need backup.
He's got the codes.
What codes?
The nuclear code?
My bank account code?
No one told me about a drive.
So how did Kabir know?
- Believe me, sir...
- Believe you?
You two were strolling about
in the metro. And you did nothing.
He was alone and he still got Biswas.
The Defence Minister Sherna Patel
asked me, "Is he in Kabir's team?
"Or ours?"
It's not fair, Colonel.
Tell that to Dr. Biswas...
...and the eight dead
Portuguese soldiers.
You are out.
Saini, I know you're in charge now.
But if something comes to mind...
...if I make some connection,
should I inform you or not?
There is something.
While I was recovering after
the Marrakesh mission...
...Kabir went to Italy on an assignment.
That was his last case
before he killed Naidu.
What was it?
OK. One second.
Yes.
Firoze Contractor.
OK.
Saini, I need the case details.
Come on!
Ready?
Merry Christmas, Mama.
Merry Christmas, Naina.
Kabir! Look at this cycle.
Wow!
"To my darling Ruhi.
"I'm watching over you always.
Love, Mama."
Did you know I asked for a cycle?
- Just now?
- Yeah!
- Really?
- Yeah.
My God! That's amazing, Ruhi.
Thank you.
I love you, my Santa.
You're a very smart girl, Ruhi,
I love you so much.
That's a nice cycle.
What's wrong, Ruhi?
Ruhi does not talk to strangers.
I'm no stranger.
I'm Kabir's friend.
I know all about you.
And Naina.
I'm serious. Asked Kabir.
Who is he, Kabir?
His name is Khalid.
He was my student once...
...now he thinks he's better
than his teacher.
How did you find us, Khalid?
Santa Claus.
Rudolph, the red nose guy?
I know him well.
I asked him: "Where's Miss Ruhi?"
As if! There's no Santa Claus.
Kabir gave me this cycle.
What? No Santa Claus?
Kabir, your friend is just like you.
He tells tall tales like you.
Let's go or the matron will scold me.
Go, Ruhi.
I'll wish Khalid "Merry Christmas"
and join you.
Bye, Khalid.
Bye, Ruhi. Merry Christmas.
You should've fired on sight.
Now your conscience will stop you.
It's Christmas. School. Kids.
Shall we talk without guns?
Rook.
Knight.
Bishop.
Pawn?
Naidu. Shroff. Biswas.
I'm looking for the fourth piece.
- Wasn't Saurabh the Pawn?
- No.
Whoever he is, he's still alive.
He's still on Ilyasi's payroll.
So, Firoze Contractor is Rizwan Ilyasi?
Yeah.
He's planning something big, Khalid.
It's all on the drive.
What is? What codes?
I gave it to an expert. She'll crack
the encrypted codes.
Hopefully soon...
- What name did you travel under?
- My own.
Our names are flagged, Khalid.
The Colonel?
Cover me.
Your disk, sir.
A gift on my wedding day.
The encryption was AES level.
So it took time to decode.
And?
Satellite Brahma's orbit vectors.
Meaning?
Brahma. India's defence satellite.
It covers the border and key
areas like Siachen and Kargil.
No wires or mobile towers there.
This satellite is the army's only means
of communication.
- Are these Brahma's orbit codes?
- Exactly.
They show Brahma's position.
These codes can lock
the satellite's functioning.
They can bring it down.
And our soldiers at the border?
They'd be helpless.
We'd have zero contact.
The enemy could cross the LOC
without our knowledge.
Like Kargil?
Worse.
Without the satellite, the enemy
could enter our country.
And change the face of India.
Without warning.
Ilyasi was right.
If a defence satellite could be
successfully destroyed...
...Osama and ISIS would be history.
But without this drive,
Ilyasi can do nothing. Right?
Right.
Khalid.
Keep this safe.
Very, very safe.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Aditi.
You're a true solider.
Just say the word, sir,
I'll elope with you tomorrow!
Get in line.
We're at the jetty in 10 minutes.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Sir, you must! Please allow me.
Of course.
What are we celebrating?
Your innocence and the
health of the nation!
It's not yet over, Khalid.
We have no proof that
the Colonel is Ilyasi's Pawn.
We can prove it. Nothing to fear.
Cheers!
- No, sir. No thanks.
- Come on, Khalid.
A drink is shared, even with an enemy.
Rook.
Knight.
Bishop.
All useless.
The Pawn!
When the Pawn reaches
the last square...
...it becomes anything it wants.
It's a game-changer.
No one can stop it.
I'm sorry, brother.
They took our mobiles.
I didn't get a chance to call you.
Saurabh, if you weren't here today.
it'd be all over.
You turned out to be the most loyal.
What's the use?
They know my face now.
They know my face too.
But very soon this face...
Face?
Your role is not over yet, Saurabh.
Saurabh, meet Dr. Malika Singhal.
The world's best plastic surgeon.
Even God could go wrong when
creating a face. But not her.
I'm in no hurry for a new face.
I want that face...
You turned out to be the most loyal
of all my men.
His face will be perfect, even
his mother couldn't tell the difference.
He'll have a few minor scars,
but I'll cover them cosmetically.
I'll work on Saurabh's vocal cords.
And modulate his voice with a laser.
It will not be perfect, but it will do.
"We walked through life side by side.
"Followed by our shadows.
"So many were the signs..."
Thought you were smart!
I spiked your drink with TTX.
The world's most potent neurotoxin.
The good thing is that
you'll feel no pain.
It'll be over soon.
Sir!
You see, sir...
...you're paid a monthly salary
of 70,000 to protect your country.
And to sell your country...
...you could earn 70 million.
Long live India!
You've served your country well.
The country is in my hands now.
We're in position.
The missile is trained on the target.
This button will activate it.
Ten minutes later...
...with Brahma destroyed, the soldiers
at the border will be helpless.
Take God's name.
I don't get on with God.
The button is yours to press, Saurabh.
None of this was possible
without you.
Impossible!
I shot you myself.
To think I trusted you.
Saurabh.
You told me a story yesterday.
My turn today.
Khalid had only one weakness.
A blind spot in his right eye.
Only I knew that.
That day a miracle took place.
Your vision was 20/20.
Either your mother's prayers
were answered...
...or Ilyasi did not only change
his own face...
...but his Pawn's face too.
That's it?
That's what gave me away?
Saurabh's body was never found.
Now I understand why.
On our way to Aditi's wedding...
Your suspicions were right.
I checked the surveillance cameras.
And?
Khalid was suspended,
yet he came back to work.
I checked the vault.
Everything was in order. But a vial
of TTX was missing.
No log entry was made.
Then I made a plan.
I told Aditi to make an antidote
for the TTX...
...and put a tracker in the disk.
Khalid, keep this safe.
Very, very safe.
Yes, sir.
Aditi gave me the antidote.
There was poison in your purpose.
Not in the drink.
When you drank the wine,
I knew for sure.
Khalid believed alcohol is forbidden.
Worse than forbidden.
Why go to all this trouble?
Why didn't you just shoot me on sight?
It was a set-up, so I could give you...
...the drive with the tracker...
...so you'd lead me to Ilyasi.
You've lost, Major Kabir.
The missile will soon blow
your great country's...
...defence satellite to pieces.
Really?
What the hell!
It's impossible!
- What's going on?
- I don't know, sir.
The missile was trained at Brahma.
After it was activated,
the coordinates were changed.
Nonsense!
Sir, I can't stop it.
The missile is engaged.
So where is it headed?
Nowhere.
It's turning back on us.
Our location coordinates were entered.
Time to leave.
Drop it, Saurabh.
Still ordering me around?
Old habits die hard.
Drop it, Saurabh. Drop it!
There must be something
about my new face.
Everyone trusts it.
Sorry, boss.
The Pawn has reached the last square.
Checkmate!
This face was Khalid's.
I won't let you die with this face.
I won't let you die with this face.
Welcome back, Kabir.
You're a hero.
No, sir.
I could only kill Ilyasi because
Khalid saved my life.
He took a bullet for me, sir.
For me - the man who killed his father.
What greater proof can there be
of Khalid's patriotism?
He's the true hero of this war.
I want the credit of this mission
to go to him.
And you?
I'm a traitor, sir.
I think we both know...
...I'm more effective alone
than operating within the system.
And until the day my loyalty is
up for sale...
...there'll be other buyers like Ilyasi.
I'll be ready for them.
The war is still on, sir.
You have a good day.
Captain Khalid Rahmani...
...fought valiantly and bravely
against the terrorists.
He martyred his life
for his team's safety.
Like a true soldier, he made the
ultimate sacrifice for the nation.
The deceased Capt. Khalid Rahmani
has been honoured by the government.
To receive the award, we request
his mother Nafisa Rahmani...
...to come onto the stage.
Good morning, Colonel.
What are you doing, my rogue agent?
I was once told soldiers must have...
...someone to go home to.
So I'm on home duty, sir.
How's Ruhi?
She's fine, sir.
She's flying back to India today.
What's your programme?
I'm looking for a cheap flight somewhere.
Any suggestions?
Your old friend is off to Muscat
for a motivational seminar.
Want to join him?
Farid Haqqani!
Last time your gun was there,
but you weren't.
This time my gun will be there...
...and so will I.
- Long live India!
- Long live India!
