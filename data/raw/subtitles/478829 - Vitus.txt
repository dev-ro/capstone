Hey, you! Switch the engine off!
No, don't accelerate!
Stop the engine!
As a boy l had a list of
favourite jobs.
My Top Ten:
On top it said in red letters:
PlLOT.
And in second position?
Coffin-maker?
l can't remember.
The other nine were of no importance.
Watch out!
When it comes back,
you have to duck!
Beautiful flight.
Wow, grandpa,
straight into the kitchen window!
Try to play!
lt's like a real piano!
Did you say " thank you" ?
Thanks.
Leo, can you see this?
The boy needs a real piano.
Mum, when do l get a real piano?
Vitus, get dressed, we have to go!
You'll have to ask your dad.
OK.
Dad, when do l get a piano?
You'll have to ask your godmother.
Watch out, don't touch anything!
This thing can hearfive times better
than a human ear.
Bats can hearten times better...
Yeah? Really!?
Put these on.
l hear even less now.
Wait a minute...
You're right, there are no batteries.
But when this thing is finished
everything will be put into a microchip,
which will be built into this here.
Then you'll hear as well as a cat.
l'm going to call it " Cat-Ear" .
Actually, " Bat-Ear" would be better...
l would like that too.
Talking about " Bat-Ear" ,
l've got something foryou.
And in fact, it works.
Press here and it lights up.
Look at the red light.
There are two little microphones.
And then this,
now you can hear like a bat.
Come to the window.
lt's great, isn't it?
l wouldn't do that Olga.
Soon he'll be telling you what to do.
Vitus, hurry up and get dressed!
Actually, l'll need that back..
When's your appointment?
Not till the afternoon.
Damn, l can't find my transparencies.
Does this have to happen now?
lt's paradoxical!
No. lt's typical...
Dad, what does " paradoxical'' mean?
''Paradoxical" means...
Leo...
l'll tell you later.
But l want to know it now.
2 minutes.
OK, 2 minutes.
Just a quick question.
Could l work 70 percent
instead of 30?
OK, but what about Vitus?
We have a very expensive child.
We have a babysitter now,
the daughter of our gem.
Monti's daughter? -Yes.
Great. - Talk to you later, bye.
No wonder a lot of people
would rather do without a hearing aid
and give up some quality of life instead
of carrying a snail-shell behind their ears.
You know that we generate 90%
of ourturnover with these " snails" .
l know that, but if Phonaxis
wants to become a global player...
... young people should wear
our hearing aids as fashion items then?
Maybe in fluorescent colours?
Yes, that's exactly what l think.
We have to beat the competition,
which isn't sleeping either,
with highly intelligent and
pretty hearing computers.
That means: Don't hide your hearing aid
but show it off
and present it like jewellery.
On the table you can see my prototypes:
the " Cat-Ear" and the " Bat-Ear"
The design might need a few changes,
but this is all about the idea, isn't it.
Sounds like you want to lead
the project yourself.
That's exactly what l think.
Why should l believe in you?
You even dropped out of university!
Because otherwise, l'll go to the competition.
Ah.
Thanks forthe presentation.
You'll be hearing from us.
The other day he read
about global warming to the children.
He told them they would all have to die.
The children started to cry.
And then l get the phone calls from the parents...
Why don't you tell Vitus to read...
" The Wolf and the 7 little kids" to them.
Actually, that's my job.
Vitus should be at school
not kindergarten.
And besides, he's very cheeky.
lnstead of calling me Mrs Pfenninger
he calls me " Obelix"
But that's a compliment.
He loves Obelix
Oh, sorry.
Hello?
Leo!
No way, you got it?
Wait a minute...
l'll take him with me.
Come on, let's go.
Bye Obelix. - Bye.
l'll think about your problem.
l love you. - l know.
Don't wipe off the lip stick,
so people can see that you're taken.
Bye Vitus. - Bye.
See you in the foyer at 7.30.
Listen Vitus.
You don't have to go to kindergarten anymore.
Cool.
While l'm at work,
a babysitter will look afteryou.
But l'm not a baby.
Then just call her a girlfriend.
lsabel is coming tonight.
We're going to a concert, OK?
l'll have to practise tonight.
You can practise all day.
Can l? - Of course.
Nobody's ever got to the top as fast as you.
Ah, lsabel.
Hello, Mrs von Holzen.
Call me Helen, please come in.
OK....
Vitus has a shower every evening.
So now you know where to find everything.
And once again, never disturb Vitus
while he's practising, OK?
Take care. Bye Vitus!
Vitus?
l'm reading.
Can l come in?
Be quiet, l want to read.
Did you know that it was me
who made the bat?
l gave it to you
foryourfirst birthday.
lt's called Abraham.
Abraham? -Abraham.
That's a beautiful name.
Oh my God, it's so big.
Do you mind if we pick some flowers?
lt's alright my little darling.
ljust need to pick some flowers.
See? You just have to ask politely
Why are you picking flowers for my mother?
Because she reminds me of your grandmother.
Can you show me a photo of her?
She was too beautiful for a photo.
Oh no, we've just missed the train.
We'll take the next one.
The walls freshly painted,
new furniture...
Have you suddenly become rich?
What do you mean by rich?
Would you like to wear one of my suits?
lf l'm not good enough
foryour dinner party
feel free to cancel the invitation.
You've brought some lovely flowers.
Yes, they're from a very special shop.
Your even more charming than your son.
Well that's not really hard.
Where's Vitus?
ln his room.
Are you getting dressed up?
l'm not into costume parties.
Let's get away grandpa.
That's impossible, you're the host.
Have a pleasant evening.
Cheers!
You have a nice place here.
Atypical 1930's house.
lt's going to be pulled down soon,
that's why the rent is low.
To go public at the right moment
could be a stroke of genius.
You want to go public with Phonaxis?
l have a feeling
that our " Cat-Ear" will attract
lots of speculators.
lt's either boom
or bust.
l do feel optimistic.
But l'm still against going public.
The stakes are too high.
Mr von Holzen, you are our saviour
or our ruin.
l hope l'm not either of them.
Nick, take a look at that buffet!
Yes, just help yourself.
Thanks, we know how it works.
Why does he hate me?
Because your wife is more beautiful.
True.
You'll talk him round.
l'm not musical at all.
My godson, however,
is all the more musical.
Really? -Yes, it's incredible.
That's interesting.
My husband wanted to become a pianist.
Really.
lt's a long time ago.
Oh , excuse me.
Do you play the piano?
No, our son does.
Oh, a talented family.
But surely not these difficult notes.
Yes, he has a good teacher and
he's been taking lessons for six months
For six months?
You don't believe that yourself!
He doesn't play like a maestro.
Leo?
Would you play something for us - No.
Come on, only one piece.
We'd all be delighted.
What does he play?
Robert Schumann's " Wild Rider" .
Please do it for our guests.
What a sweet little chap!
You can sense that he's musical.
Beautiful...
Extraordinary.
A real wunderkind.
l've never seen anything like it.
He's only 6, but we do hope...
Well, he didn't get it from me...
They've told us that his lQ
is so high it's incalculable.
But l don't know much about it.
l'm too stupid.
l've been telling Leo
that we're raising a real talent here.
Do you rememberthe horoscope
that l did for Vitus?
You carry a huge responsibility.
Especially as his mother...
lf you know what l mean.
All of the world's great pianists
were so-called wunderkind
in their childhood.
No exception.
You really have to foster his talents.
The earlierthe better.
He should go straight to the conservatory.
You don't just owe this to your son
but also to music.
Now the world knows
we have a real wunderkind.
And a cheeky little monkey.
Maybe Knaak was right...
We have to foster his talents.
What he doesn't learn now
he'll never learn.
We shouldn't put pressure on him.
Otherwise he might do the opposite.
lt won't work without a little pressure.
Vitus needs that.
Same as you.
You're right in principle.
But an academy is for adults.
The boy doesn't even go
to school yet.
But didn't you...
However, l have recognised his talent.
We will accept him.
Did you hearthat Vitus?
l'll teach you myself.
That's unbelievable!
Thank you very much.
Are you a concert pianist yourself?
He's in good hands with me.
Are you happy Vitus ?
Of course he'll keep on taking lessons.
But not with you l'm afraid.
Don't you understand...
Now listen!
He's our son
and you're just not good enough for him!
And l'm sorry too Mrs Piantoni.
Just send me the bill!
Good bye Mrs Piantoni.
6 months of piano lessons,
and she thinks he belongs to her.
Where is he by the way?
ln his room. He doesn't want to eat.
He wants to stay with Mrs Piantoni.
" l love her'' he said.
Vitus?
l've got something foryou.
Come out here...
Vitus, hold the spandrel.
Why shouldn't it fly?
You know all about aerodynamics, don't you!
The bulge creates an air cushion
and it flies.
All we need is some
silky skin like the bats have.
Very good. Silky skin!
Yes, silky skin...
Do you want to learn how to saw?
Come here, l'll show you.
Hold here...
... and follow this line here.
And now you.
But l'm not allowed to play with this.
We're not playing, we're working!
Come on!
Hold the workpiece...
...and go!
Oh my God!
What is going on here?
Are you completely crazy ?
What if he hurts his hands...
Just imagine the disaster!
" Completely mad" ...
Listen Helen!
We are building wings!
Wings!? What for?
To fly of course.
That's what they'll look like.
Vitus, promise that you'll never play
with such dangerous things again!
We're not playing, we're working.
l'm the boss here.
But l wearthe trousers.
l wish you a very
happy birthday.
Many thanks.
When you come here next time,
we will fly.
Oh no, you can't do this to me.
OK...
No, l'm very proud of you.
l'm proud of you too. OK.
Bye Leo.
We'll eat without daddy.
Bye, lsabel.
See you.
Vitus?
Bye-bye.
We're going to Sonja and Walter.
Your dinner is on the table.
We'll be back around 11, OK?
Yes, l know.
OK then, bye. Bye.
How long are you gonna stay in your room?
Until l'm an adult.
Can you help me?
lt's much too heavy for us.
lf you want, you can come with me.
Until we're adults?
Really? That's extreme.
Do you want to know
how bats reproduce?
No, thank you.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
l don't know yet.
You know so much, but not that?
l want to become a rock singer.
Sounds good.
Great, to be here in Zurich now!
Are you ready to rock?
That's the way we like it, isn't it Vitus?
That's good, lsabel.
lt's empty. -What?
lsabel?
lsabel get up!
Come on, l'll take you home.
lsabel, what did you two do?
No idea.
Come with me.
l'm back.
What's got into the girl?
Did you ask her? - No.
How could she give alcohol to Vitus?
Come here.
You've filmed them?
Yes, l used a sensor.
l don't believe this!
My skirt, my jewellery!
We need a new babysitter.
OK, but she's a good dancer...
Think it over.
Please!
Sorry, but l've already decided.
And what about your career?
Maybe this is my career.
Even the experts say:
Now or never.
You're so quiet.
Are you ill? ls something bothering you?
l've been waiting all day.
Ok then, let me guess.
You're in love?
Not me.
But l know who l'm gonna marry
when l'm grown-up.
Really. And who will that be?
Come on, tell me!
But it's still a secret.
OK, top secret.
lsabel?
Mummy, when is lsabel coming?
Vitus, l have a surprise foryou.
You have a new babysitter:
Me!
l don't need a babysitter!
And lsabel is my girlfriend.
Listen, lsabel won't be coming anymore.
She's too young to have
such a huge responsibility.
Come on, let's practise the piano.
No, l want lsabel back!
Are you crazy-Are you crazy?
Hello, who is it?
Post, express-delivery. - l'm coming!
Vitus!
Vitus, you can't do that!
Open up!
Sweetheart, please open up.
Vitus!
Open that stupid door at once!
Vitus, open the door!
Damn it all!
l'll give you one more chance!
Or else l'll get the caretaker
with his crowbar.
l'll count to 10! One, two, three
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, TEN!
Look, the " professor"
coming to school by taxi.
Poor guy!
That smart-ass could at least
wear normal clothes.
" Shitus" will do that when he
reaches puberty.
The interest is 1.258 percent
and is being continuously credited.
How much money will be on
his account after 322 days.
Without the calculator, please.
Ah, someone knows the result already...
Vitus?
No Sir,
But l could calculate it foryou.
Then go on.
lf the account neither has credit
nor debit,
the interest would be...
216.6.
So, after 322 days
There'd be 19466.6 on the account.
Correct.
But your arrogant behaviour
is an insult to my intelligence.
Excuse me Sir,
but if l'm insulting your intelligence
there are, after all, two people in here
who have some intelligence.
OK, that's enough.
Pack your bag and get out!
OK, OK.
The school has phoned again.
What has he done this time?
l don't know.
They want to talk to us.
Talk to us?
ls Wednesday at 3 o' clock OK?
Next week? No chance.
Leo, it's important.
Yes, l know.
lt's a shame your husband's not here.
l know, sorry.
You can speak Swiss-German...
We really have to find a solution.
Your son sabotages every lesson.
He doesn't miss a single opportunity
to make the teacher look stupid
in front of the whole class.
My teachers refuse
to carry on teaching him.
But you cannot throw out a child,
just because he isn't challenged enough.
Yes, you are right.
That's why there are special schools...
... forthe highly gifted.
Vitus is wasting his time here.
And we are wasting ourtime.
My husband and l are against
such " zoological gardens" .
A special needs school is out of the question.
Well.
ln that case l'll enroll Vitus
forthe school leaving exams.
At the age of 12?
Yes, why not?
Good.
Very good.
Hold your horses.
The left hand has to hold the pace.
Hold back a bit, know what l mean?
Syncopation: denuto!
That's boring.
Let's try the second last bar,
and try to play it a little bit boring.
Would you like an other slice?
Yes, please.
Thanks.
Do you want to do yourfinal exams now?
l don't know. Why should l?
You could go to university.
You earn a lot as an engineer.
You could still play piano as a hobby.
The lnstitute of Technology at 13?
Well OK, it is a bit early...
You could do a
traineeship with us, for 2 or 3 years.
You could invent something, like your dad.
Have you seen this before?
lt's the " mother of hearing aids" .
Worldwide.
ln fact it's the further development
of the " Cat-Ear" and " Bat-Ear" .
lt's a kind of Rolls-Royce.
With this, Phonaxis has increased
its turnovertenfold.
lf l had bought some shares then,
we'd be rich now.
But we are rich!
l mean really rich.
Shall l tell you a secret?
The boss
will be retiring soon.
There's a rumour, that l'll be his successor.
Cool!
You'll be the CEO of Phonaxis!
Touch wood...
Ah, where were we?
Yes -you have to plan your career.
Let's have a look at it together...
Von Holzen.
Hi, Klaus.
What about the chips?
l'm kind of busy,
but go ahead.
Bat scientist, architect, chemist,
don't you fancy any of these?
Maybe cabinetmaker,
and you could take over my workshop.
No. - No...
What about banker? Taxi driver?
l got it:
Pilot.
You don't even want to become a pilot...
lt's getting difficult now.
Maybe butcher? Vet? Surgeon?
You are a hopeless case.
l'd like to be someone else.
Like who, for example?
l don't know, whoever, just normal.
As normal as me?
No, more normal.
Well, then just become normal...
But how?
Hold this!
lf you can't decide,
you'll have to part with things
you like.
Get it?
You've only practised fortwo hours!
lf l have to play " holding back"
l can also practise " holding back" .
Don't talk nonsense!
Go on, go and practise!
OK...
She lives in a castle?!
Look!
She's coming towards us.
ls that her?
Yes, that's her.
Gina Fois, the living piano legend,
She looks like an old bat.
Vitus !
So, you're Vitus.
Nice to meet you.
Have a seat.
What are you going to play for me?
l'd like you to play something for me.
Me?
That's very flattering,
but l'd rather listen to you
playing Scarlattis sonata in E minor.
No.
OK, l'll play something foryou,
but it's yourturn first.
Come on Vitus, play!
You're wasting Madame Fois' time.
l don't feel like it.
Do it for me.
Why is it always foryou?
Don't worry madam.
lt's more important for a pianist
to have good parents than good teachers.
Vitus, you should play neither
foryour mother nor me.
Just take yourtime until you feel like
playing the piano forthe sake of the music.
Cold rationality and a warm heart -
that's
what makes a great pianist.
That's why l want to become a vet.
l hope you are satisfied...
You want to be a great pianist? Forget it!
Once and for all.
Can l visit grandpa forthe weekend?
No way!
Do you have any idea how many youngsters
would like an opportunity like this?
They come here from all overthe world
just for one single piano lesson, and you?
l'll neverforgive you forthis, do you hear me?
Never!
We're here!
Here!
He was lucky.
We couldn't find any injuries,
not one bruise...
Extraordinary, considering the heavy fall.
There are miracles though,
especially with children.
The wings carried him for a bit.
But he isn't an lcarus, luckily.
He's still unconscious!
At the moment the initial diagnosis
is concussion of the brain.
What do you mean " at the moment" ?
There are injuries, which only
show up after a few days.
With brain injuries you can never rule out
long-term implications.
l'll show you some pictures.
Were you trying to fly away from me?
You could have killed yourself.
Do you realize that?
You're taking a long time!
Sorry.
Well, l have plenty of time.
Check!
And what is this?
Dad brought it,
lt's for my exams.
Vitus, what are you doing?
This isn't our car.
What's the matter darling?
The following Mrs von Holzen:
We have tested his speaking
and reading skills,
His memory and his sense of perception.
We got normal levels.
What does " normal levels" mean?
Please, take a seat.
" Normal" according to his age group.
He's even slightly above average,
especially in his logical thinking.
And the lQ test?
Did you do...
Yes, but at the moment
the test is irrelevant.
But if you really want to know:
lt's around 120.
120?
lt used to be 180, how is that possible?
l know.
lt's difficult to say.
Even for specialists like us
The brain remains a mystery.
There's no real explanation
for extraordinary abilities.
lf l can give you some advice:
Give yourself and Vitus some time.
Time, time, time...
He'll make some progress.
You just want to cheer me up.
Many thanks.
l cannot understand your disappointment.
After all, you have a healthy and normal child.
l have to give worse news
to a lot of parents.
Listen everybody!
Silence please!
Daniel, please!
This is your new schoolmate:
Vitus.
He has changed schools
And he's with us from now on.
Vitus, you can sit next to Jens.
Hi, Vitus, what's up?
Hi Jens.
Loosen up,
now make a fist.
Yes, that's right. And again.
Play the run, and take yourtime!
" Es" , again " es" , and then " b" , okay?
" Es" ! Doesn't it hurt your ears?
At least yourfingers should be able
to remember.
Sorry.
Music comes from the heart,
from yourfingers, from your soul!
All you hurt was you head.
Sorry mum.
l'm sorry.
Don't you feel lonely sometimes?
