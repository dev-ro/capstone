May the Force Be with us
My name.
Right.
My name is Marni Olivia Olsen.
I'm in the last year
here in Ridgefield High.
How is life
a student in 2002?
Well, for starters,
my name is spelled ...
Life is hard.
 We are the champions
my friends </ i>
 When you're in luck. </ i>
And we will continue fighting
until the end </ i>
 We are the champions
We are the champions </ i>
No time
for losers </ i>
 Cause we are the champions </ i>
 The world </ i>
 Unfortunately I do not ...</ i>
 not had much luck. </ i>
 Hardly. </ i>
Returning to my first
years in school ...
Sorry, is reserved.
Sorry, is reserved.
 I come from a small town
California, </ i>
 and a small school
like mine, </ i>
 always have one person
that's so weird, </ i>
 stands out from others. </ i>
In my school  ...</ i>
I was that person.
"We're going to train?
"Right, girls, come on!
Here we go!
Five, six, seven and eight.
And one, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven and eight.
I read somewhere
that its image in high school </ i>
 determine who you
will be for life. </ i>
I really hope
that this is not the case.
Recalling have
a favorite part. </ i>
 That's my brother
Will older. </ i>
 large
winner and beautiful. </ i>
Get off the road.
Nice work, loser.
Incidentally, you are more beautiful
with the mask.
Not yet
talking to me?
I'm not in the mood, Marni.
I just want you to know
I'm sorry.
Those girls are right,
I'm a loser.
You know ...
-What girls?
What?
"No, no, no.
Who said that?
I talk to them now ...
No matter.
You can not
always protect me.
It's the truth.
I wanted to see
it's amazing how you, Marni.
Just gotta believe
in itself
and so do,
able to do all
you want.
 And of course he was right. </ i>
When I changed the way
look at me. </ i>
 Things have changed. </ i>
I took the unit
and started wearing lenses. </ i>
 spent more than U.S. $ 8
the haircut. </ i>
I've been very
to get here,
but if not
by determination
that girl with Richville,
I would not be here today.
Working on the largest
offices in Los Angeles.
Telling a bunch
aspiring advertisers
on the days I
was part of the team weird.
You can not control
what happens to you,
but you can control
how to react to it.
It's all perception.
This is Public Relations.
Thank you.
And good luck.
-Good job.
Thank you.
Nice speech.
Inspiring.
Thank you, sir.
Very much.
Need to get off
in your room.
What?
You said you need
leave my room?
That's right.
"But I ...
Just ordered two days off
for the wedding of my brother.
Has a vacancy in the office
New York.
For vice president.
It's yours.
I. ..
Vice President ...
Unless you have problems
with promotions.
No! I'm not!
Sure, I'm not.
Thank you, sir.
You deserved it.
I'm anxious to see
all of you too, Mom.
I can not believe
how it all happened so fast.
I know.
And is so beautiful.
Joanna got a dress
beautiful for the wedding.
Tried to tell her
that was exaggerated.
 had to say: Happy
to help and to know them. </ i>
 I feel bad for not
have known Joanna yet. </ i>
I know.
Is not it funny?
You have studied
in high school together.
And do not know.
Wait.
We studied together in high school?
"I thought you knew.
-No.
I received a picture of her
but did not seem familiar.
The school was very small,
and do not remember it.
 is because she did not use
the name in high school, </ i>
 used a nickname. </ i>
DD.
-DD?
-No ...
-TT.
-TT?
I can not believe I forgot.
-JJ?
-Yes! JJ!
 Yes, it was JJ. </ i>
No! No! No!
No, no.
Lady
put your seat belt
and return to your seat.
Mom, you're saying ...
Please! I heard you speak
about cats for 45 minutes.
Lady, you need to sit,
is for their own safety.
Mother just a minute.
Sorry, Hadda.
This is an emergency.
My brother will marry
the girl
that destroyed
my life in high school.
If you do not mind,
could get away!
Hi, Mom, I ...
Any problems?
Do not know who has a problem.
Is your brother is getting married
with your worst nightmare?
So I did not know
it was the same girl?
Nobody knew.
My brother was the last year.
I can not blame him
for maintaining the secrecy
my novel of the college.
Cookie?
There's 7 billion people
this planet
and I'm stuck
a sister like her.
That was the reason
I've left home.
Marni, let me talk
about bullies.
They are like terrorists,
but they are emotional terrorists.
It can never leave them
raise your hands.
The best we can do,
is to stay quiet.
Show that you
is in charge.
Apart from that no matter
hundreds of people ...
-Millions.
Saint-million?
-Yes.
-Wow.
"I have to give a reason.
-Absolutely.
The important thing is that things
changed since then.
Must go back there,
and show that JJ
than you are capable.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
You can.
"I can.
-Can.
There she is!
Hi, my little girl.
Baby, 4 months
is a long time.
Hi.
"You're tall.
Look at you.
You are so beautiful.
-I felt so much his fault.
-I felt too.
Really?
But not as much as
Chakka's going to feel?
Where did you learn
to say that?
Joanna always
let me say.
Are you enjoying the Joanna?
Neither were
with her right.
Take the case of his sister.
Honey, come!
-Ben, answer the telephone?
Sure.
Cocoapuff!
Come here, Cocoapuff.
Joanna took Cocoapuff
for the bath.
Everyone needs to be beautiful
for marriage.
Including Cocoapuff.
 Honey, we're home. </ i>
We have a full house,
need to see where
you will sleep.
-What 's mother.
Marni-Olivia Olsen.
Right.
It will be like a party
I was not invited.
I need to make dinner.
Honey, come!
"You scared me!
"Come here.
His pretty boy
inside!
-Look at you, is beautiful.
Thank you.
Can you believe it?
It was not long ago.
Remember when we swear
in the tree house
that we would never get married?
Yeah, some things have changed.
"I'm counting on it.
It's too late
for a hug?
My God, you're fine.
You are skinny!
I lost a little weight,
thanks for noticing.
You're beautiful.
Joanna returned,
I want you down there.
Slice in half.
Set aside.
So you wind
carefully
strip 9 inches;
and is exactly like that.
You're a great cook.
Look who it is.
Marni, Marni, Marni ...
Look at you.
You are so beautiful.
Thank you.
Did you know that waited too long
this moment?
-We are finally here.
"You think you expect too much.
"I have so much to talk.
-Believe, me too.
But I will not do it
in front of them.
But first,
Let me tell you how good it is
finally meet her.
How?
Will, I told you so,
and here you are.
Can not wait to go
the next day
talking about my marriage.
The salad looks good.
There it is! Cocoapuff, buddy!
Cocoapuff!
Who's Your Mama?
That, good boy!
Cocoapuff, time for dinner!
Joanna, do not prefer
hopefully that your aunt?
It's rude not expect it.
Do not worry about it,
always late.
-Are you ready, dear?
-I.
Close your eyes.
Sorry, we kill
daddy tonight?
You know how your father
always interested
the connection of mind
with the body.
And since I am the godfather
can not be fat on Saturday.
That's right.
-Neither is fat.
I'm trying a diet
a colleague who spoke at the hospital.
Most do not realize
when they are satisfied
and need to empty plate
to know.
Moreover, when blindfolded,
depends on the stomach.
I've lost 2.7 kg.
"And where has gained muscle?
-Ben!
I think it's a way
smart to stay in shape.
Thanks, Joanna.
Let's eat.
So ...
How did you meet?
We were in karaoke
on the beach ...
"He was on stage singing.
-It was not my best moment.
"Really?
No, it was not.
But he was so cute there
I wanted to save it.
So I got on stage
and sang together.
And she always saves me
since then.
I find it unbelievable that a
town like Ridgefield,
almost grown
in neighboring blocks
and only met now.
It's funny, is not it?
Hilarious!
Not? Our paths
not crossed until now.
It's not funny?
-It! Very funny!
Very.
Will told me that works
chic at this company
Public Relations
in Los Angeles?
That's right.
In fact, talking about it.
I have news.
"I was promoted.
What?
And now I'm vice-president
office in NY.
No, no.
A promotion in NY?
-Yes!
Honey, congratulations.
"That's fantastic!
I'm so proud!
Will meet celebrities?
This is really cool!
Enough about me,
I know you.
I mean, what they do?
My life is boring,
in comparison.
I doubt it.
I'm sure continued
interesting since high school.
Love to hear how your life
has been wonderful.
After my parents died
I rethought my life
and realized I was not
making the right choices.
So I signed up
nursing school
and directing my energies
to help the needy.
Good.
Good for you.
No, good is not
neither the beginning.
I am kinda obsessed
in helping the needy.
Will and I love children.
"She's adorable.
"Dad.
Yeah, Dad.
That is, Marni.
In fact, it's good for the job
help with self esteem,
because to be honest not
You can count on the system.
You still have the number?
-Ben!
My God!
I have talked too much about me.
No problem.
I had no idea how
you were generous.
Truth.
I am very proud.
Proud to call it
my bride.
Bride!
He said it again.
Gail, he is getting married!
I'll fill my glass.
Anybody want anything?
Great!
My God!
Jesus!
Mom, you scared me.
What do you think?
Joanna is great, is not it?
Almost too good
to be true.
I think so.
I think so sweet
generates warmth ...
Where's my trash
for recycling?
Come with me, please.
Here is the recyclable.
E. ..
It's beautiful! Maybe, Joanna
can sleep here.
Listen on your promotion
to New York ...
I'm proud of you.
This is fantastic.
Thank you.
I'm just worried
with all of this bid Joanna.
Do not think it's strange
she does not remember me?
The school was not so great.
I not even remember half
the people with whom I studied.
Yeah, but you're Gail Bayer.
Everyone loves you.
No idea
I have been through.
Really? Learn ...
That no one leaves unscathed
high school. Nobody.
Never told me
who had trouble in high school.
Why is the past.
Passed.
If you had problems
with Joanna.
In the past.
You can fix it now.
Remember: everyone
deserves a second chance.
I know.
Joanna's aunt arrived.
I can not believe
my Joanninha will marry.
"I'm very happy for you.
Me too.
Aunt Mona.
This is the sister of Will,
Marni.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
-Also.
And this is his mother.
Gail?
Ramona.
Did you ever know?
Gail!
Ramona!
How long ago?
Do not say, if I do not have
that you choke.
Who remembers?
-How to know?
We studied together.
We were best friends.
Much the same friends.
You're ... Great.
-Stop.
No, seriously.
You're amazing.
Really ...
It seems
an actress in a computer.
Thank you.
You must be Ben.
I have something ...
You'll love.
Four Four?
But it has not even been released!
-How do you say, Ben?
Thank you!
It was a pleasure, sir.
Can not wait to play!
I gotta go.
Enjoy!
And Marni ...
I think I have
the perfect gift ...
It's a Bryan Reyes?
-Bryan who?
It's new collection?
I thought I had exhausted.
Bryan is always
in my hotel.
He is always in the Sullenger.
You own the Hotel Sullenger?
The Group Sullenger.
In fact, 14 properties.
I can not believe they're mine.
I can not believe my mother
never told me
who was a friend of one of the 100
most powerful women.
Please list those
change all the time.
-It has not changed in 10 years.
"Really.
But you know,
the most important to me
is that those who stand in my hotel
feel at home.
I would say that is my goal.
Which reminds me ...
You both have struggled
well with this marriage.
I want to spend one week
in any one of my resorts.
Bali, Maui, Paris ...
"No, no.
-Yes!
I insist.
Ramona think that
overblown.
I'm trying to think
buy your love?
Did it work?
Yes!
This is so exciting.
I mean, it's like now
we were a family.
Why are we here?
Come on in, the family.
Let's drink, Ramona.
I think we have
French champagne.
Every place, every door had
something better.
I spent $ 400
I do not know where.
I mean, it's still beautiful in Switzerland.
"I love Switzerland.
"You were never there.
Yeah, but I love the chocolates.
The cheese, watches.
Why not come to pass
one time in my new house?
What about at Christmas?
-They love it.
-Yes!
We can go jet.
Seriously.
You have a plane?
Honey, sometimes I think
he's got me.
I never stop in place,
always going to another
continent and
not to mention the back,
for my divorce.
We are in dispute 14 months ago
and only been married for 7.
Ramona, sorry.
It must be difficult.
It is, but nothing
what a delightful piece
whatever it is that
can not solve.
He is doing
this diet.
If the eyes are the window
to the stomach ...
So show me,
open the curtain.
As you know this?
I had no idea that this
came to the U.S. diet.
-I made her the oath.
Me too!
Excuse me.
Hello?
Hello, dear.
Georgia King
wedding planner.
Georgia King
is the organizer?
It is requested
for all our customers
to make their marriages.
Thank you, dear.
Goodbye, beautiful.
These two ...
You are so adorable.
Gail, they do not
remember when you were young?
Your mother should not
have counted, but ...
In high school, she was
practically a star.
She said.
I mean, we know.
Not a star.
You were a super nova.
Every girl wanted
be like her mother.
Prom queen, prom,
captain of the cheerleaders ...
Not at the same time.
Wait, was captain of the leaders
Ridgefield cheerleader?
In my last year.
Me too.
-Joanna!
I was the captain
cheerleader.
As I do not know that?
Joanna, heard
Bayer flying?
It was a move forward
of our supporters.
It is ...
You're Bayer
Bayer flying?
I invented the motion.
My God!
His mother is a legend!
I'm not a legend.
I am a legend?
"I love to see it.
"No, no, no.
Go! Go!
Gators!
Dad, can I please
use your sale?
Legal.
Go!
Go, Gators!
Go!
Go, Gators!
Go!
Go, Gators!
Ready?
Right!
The kings of Ridgefield
came out today.
Let's get around and fight,
fight, fight!
Again,
we go again!
Ridgefield will win,
win, win!
Go!
Gators!
Must be nice being
together again.
It's like
in high school again.
Yes, exactly
as then.
-Gators!
Mother!
All I want
is an apology.
Vents not me.
I should believe
Joanna who changed his life.
And doing what Mom said:
Forget and move on.
I think it should
be a good idea.
Since now
divide the room.
Ben!
Thank you.
What a gentleman.
Joanna is my only
family now ...
It's hard to imagine marriage
without her parents here.
Sure.
It means a lot to me
she is with you
and his beautiful family.
It means a lot
for us too.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good night, Ramona.
She seemed normal, right?
Yes, you seem surprised.
They were friends, right?
We were best friends,
throughout
elementary school;
continue close
in high school
to the prom.
And she ...
Had a small
nervous breakdown
something happened,
and I ...
Never wanted to see me.
Not sure why, honestly.
Honey, it was long ago.
And as always says:
everyone deserves a 2nd chance.
Do not worry.
I honestly do not remember
me in high school?
No.
Sorry, can not remember
almost nothing in high school.
Please do not take
it personally.
Hello, everyone.
Look at the two ...
Are not having those
chatter of women, are they?
Not yet.
Vim goodnight
for my lady.
-My favorite!
Sure.
He is not completely
Adorable?
I will give privacy
you.
I loved what I did with the place.
My curtains.
"I knew that I alone?
-I ...
I thought you said
going to bed.
My room is half
crowded now.
I thought about staying here
with you.
If there is no problem.
Okay,
no problem.
Thank you.
You had said
that his sister was hot.
What is this?
-Mark, was marking his clothes?
"Of course.
"I was there.
I do not know why I'm nervous.
Good morning, darling.
Who's my big boy?
Cocoapuff, no!
Do not growl at visitors.
Sorry,
he growl at you,
probably does not.
It happens a lot.
Look at this picture to Marni.
She was so sad
but it was very brave.
Let's turn the page.
We have to go now!
We have much to do
before the dance class.
Dance class?
Gonna rock the marriage.
You have to get Grandma.
She can not wait
to see it.
Come on, come on.
True, she kept
to talk to you at the mall.
Went shopping
with our grandma?
Bunny and I
we're best friends.
Come on, girls,
we can not waste time.
I'm so excited
with the dance!
Come on, Marni.
Seriously, Marni,
do not worry;
have time to shower
before my tea pot.
So, Will, as proposed?
It was in the tree house.
In our tree house?
It's my gift
Joanna,
I'll put in our house,
once it is built.
Bringing home the tree?
You can not take it.
We and Dad have built everything
can not take our history.
How about when he comes to town,
can go visit her in our house.
Darling

It's fate!
 Because your kiss,
is on my list </ i>
 Because your kiss,
your kiss on my list </ i>
 Because your kiss,
is on my list </ i>
One of the best
things in life </ i>
Stop!
Sorry.
I thought that bag
was a kitten.
What?
Look,
Ridgefield college.
Certainly brings
many memories.
But if he knew at the time,
I know now,
do many things
otherwise.
And you, Joanna?
Any regrets?
Actually ...
if I could turn back time,
begin my work
volunteer
in social programs.
I'd like a boyfriend.
He must have had many boyfriends,
is not, Joanna?
Not many would say.
I learned that one of the leaders
cheerleader,
had a boyfriend
in each city school,
after doing so
spend everything he had,
passed to the next.
You were a cheerleader!
Remember who was she?
-Whatever it?
"Nothing.
Just wanted to know who
this promiscuous interests.
I knew she dated
to the Director Wilson.
Not dated!
I mean ...
It was just a rumor I heard,
Judy Carbash
invented because he was jealous.
They care

"It would be great.
It has helped a lot,
I help her.
Do not be silly,

They are fighting over me.
So, Grandma,

and my personal assistant.
Tim
Tim is the Look
I want you to listen.
And fall in love boat.
And our first "rhythm" will be
a key to come loose.
How is the first class of you
let me say that I loved.
Okay, let me teach
Carnival and the pace of the lambada.
This dance is prohibited,
brings good luck,
and fertility
for the happy couple.
And I'll teach you all.
Understood what I said?
So let's start
this party.
Marni, sorry, I thought
there would be more people.
It's okay.
Do not worry.
-Olsen?
Charlie, you come from?
Sorry for the delay,
but had some ...
Do not worry about it.
Marni, you remember Charlie?
More or less.
Come here.
Hi.
-Marni.
You. ..
-Grew.
Yeah, sure. And I stopped.
God bless you beautiful girl
and the gentleman!
Marni, I want to dance
with Charlie.
And you two, that train
dance of the bride and groom, go there.
Since I will help you.
Go dancing. That's right.
Stretch your neck,
as a swan.
Remember to bend over his knee,
lambada is, do not be so hard.
They like to tinker
a little more?
So what do I do?
Let me see if I remember,
his left hand ...
Left foot goes forward,
to the middle, back and middle.
Front, middle, and a half ago.
Do not be intimidated, is difficult.
Thank you.
Can I drive a little dance?
-What does she want to prove?
"Well, if I were her ...
Do what?
Would silence my mouth,
before saying something stupid.
Do not try at home
for professionals only.
Forget it.
Mark, hold me by my sign.
-Hold me.
What?
-Ready?
"No!
My God,
these people are crazy.
Then she apologized?
And do not think I will ask,
but she remembers me.
It's all an act,
everyone loves it.
And that's what she does, she
brainwashed in the Will.
What, Marni,
is not exaggerating?
Will lead to the tree house.
What?
Ben, I'll leave it sooner
training in baseball.
Ramona must leave the hotel.
Leaving in 5 minutes, right?
We have to help him, Ben.
He has protected us for life.
It's time to reciprocate.
What do we do, Marni?
He is getting married in 48 hours.
Ben in Public Relations
48 hours is a lifetime.
We just have to isolate the problem,
compute a plan,
and offer a solution.
We have to catch it yourself.
Will, what will you do now?
Can I talk to you?
It may be next?
Joanna back soon
and wanted to run now.
Really? I was also
wanting to run, I'm with you!
Sure, but I'm training

In fact,
I just came because ...
I believe we can overcome.
Just wanted to come here,
to say that ...
Whatever has happened
among us, is in the past.
I guarantee on my part ...
It's over.
I like that.
Good for you, Gail, bravo!
So we're good, right?

-How are champions?
-Great. I love, love to run!
Will wanted to speak to you,
on Joanna.
It's good talk about it.
Yeah, is not it?
Never talk
about it.
Sure, she's not only married
with you, but to us all.
So I would not,
if not supported me.
In this case, Will ...
William ...
-Cramping!
-Marni, I know what you will say ...
It means a lot to me
that opens your heart and tell me.
-What happened, your heart stopped?
-What, Charlie.
-In the accompanying Marni?
-Yes!
-Sure?
-I!
"In that case, we have a yes.
-Come on.
Come on!
Give an advantage
for you.
Come on baby, come
click here.
Beware the carpet.
Take my medicine pouch.
One of them may help.
-Disgusting.
"Go get my bag.
-Marni, what happened?
-I took a shortcut.
-For a timber?
No, for a nest.
-We should not have left her.
Charlie, you're here.
Here, indeed.
Blurred vision, that's not good.
No, the ants took
Her lenses.
What kind of ants?
Forgot to ask,
but next time I ask.
It's nothing fancy,
I'm fine.
There is,
leg is numb,
but it feels nothing
thanks ant bites.
Mother, for drama.
"That was not cool.
"It was my fault.
-You should not be standing here.
No, sorry, I ...
Okay. Let me take you
to a safe place.
-You will enjoy it.
-You will not believe what I did.
"You're scratching everywhere.
What happened?
She fell to the nest.
With so many bites she may have
an anaphylactic shock.
It's a nurse, what to do?
-We need allergy!
-We need allergy!
-Who is she talking about?
Honey, stop scratching.
You look great.
How lucky am I saved
my glasses in high school?
You can not fix
lenses until tomorrow ...
I thought you wanted to see.
The irritation seems spines!
I feel like nothing
had changed since high school.
Marni, I know you are only bites
and it will disappear.
And as noted, everything is fine,
and live happily ever after.
Happy forever
is a fairy tale, a mother.
High school was a horror movie,
this week is the continuation.
Are at times
so I ...
I do not want a perfect time
with a reflection
I'm not in the mood
for that now.
Enjoy a day
My wisdom.
Marni ...
Being a mother is difficult,
no instruction manual.
Waking up every morning and wait
take good care of their children.
It's high pressure, must
too much responsibility.
But everything I do,
affect your life.
So I want you to know
that what I do ...
It is very ... very ...
Wrong!
Mother, what are you doing?
Warned.
I hate being late.
This, this, this!

"Want to cookie?
"Not since college.
Hi, sister.
The party is not a success?
Look, sister.

You can make things easier.
Just need to apologize.
If apologizing
I will say no.
Okay.
Sorry.
That's it. This is your big
apology?
Okay.
He made his choice.
Maybe Will should know
some detail.
Think well before
to do something crazy sister.
Who thinks he
gonna believe?
No. No way.
It will not do that to me again.
I am not some silly girl
that persuaded the school.
Really?
He looked in the mirror lately?
I have to admit,
she won the first battle.
She played very well. Very good.
But I'm grateful.
I realized that I have
playing hard.
Let us move forward,
lead to another level.
How? We?
No, she is his enemy.
Will not be part
of his evil plan.

Do not believe me,

of not having done?
My last two marriages.
And I'm beginning

Why?
I made a mistake.
A big mistake.
I do not know how to fix.
You're human, Joanna.
Making mistakes
is part of who we are.
How do we fix
is what matters.
Whatever you do,
will be the right thing.
Okay?
I'm so proud of you.
And I know his parents too.
Yeah, I'm not sure.

Joanna will acknowledge to you.
In a song.
Hi
This is for you, Will.
Love you so, dear.
 I found my only love </ i>
 You're too kind

Must be joking.
 I found my happiness </ i>
 And all because of you </ i>
As she does this.
Forget it.
I can not believe my brother

This is an excellent karaoke.
I know she needs to improve.
But you're too tense,
need to relax.
This is a party.
Have fun.
I love you.
Love you lots.
Right. I know I will win
a new daughter.
But I had no idea it was
a rap star.
Bravo.
Will, I love you.
His mother and I could not
be more proud of you.
You are not just
a great lawyer.
It is passionate.
Worries with others.
And more importantly ...
It is honest.
And see that someone found
with the same qualities,
make me the guy
happier there.

I'm the godfather.
But you should know that tomorrow
the best man for real
'll be right beside you.

I was not completely honest.
Who else wants
make a toast?
Tim wants!
No.
Okay.
Joanna, congratulations
for this special night.
Just wanted to say ...
Today is a special occasion.
It is special for many reasons,
one of them is because I and Joanna
we are finally taking
a rehearsal dinner together.
Still would prefer
our rehearsal dinner.
It was very immature.
Returning to the speech.
Joanna ...
After many,
many hours in therapy.
I understand why you
did not show up that night.
-They were engaged?
"Now I know that's not my fault.
It was the end of the school,
new era, it was immature.
Okay.
I miss you.
Joanna.
Miss your voice,
she made a noise when ...
We cozy up.
I will swap the phone
my house.
"He went insane.
-How not tell me this?
Sorry.
I would like to dedicate
a song for you.
This is our music.
 During the night scenes </ i>
Dinner and wine  </ i>
 Saturdays Girls </ i>

So ...
Now we have a special video

Did you know?
Bride?
That guy?
 Okay, I'm ready. </ i>
 Hi, I'm J. J. Clark.
And I'm in Ridgefield veteran. </ I>
First  mean
as were the losers in 2002 </ i>
 to see how
things have changed. </ i>
Where did they find it?
 want to know what life is like
a girl of 18 in high school? </ i>
 Life is easy. </ i>
That was the time capsule.
To be opened in 50 years.
You have to work
to be number one. </ i>
But high school
is not that difficult. </ i>
 It's more like a prison. </ i>
 this prison,
I who command you. </ i>
So my job is
leaving prisoners in line. </ i>
 Look, I found one. </ i>
 In high school,
only the strongest survive. </ i>
 The weak are not allowed. </ i>
 Loser </ i>
 Collegiate is a sentence
4 years. </ i>
You can not leave
even with good behavior. </ i>
 Believe me,
is better to be wrong. </ i>
 Get out of my sight. </ i>
Will, sorry.
I was a stupid girl.
You know I'm not anymore.
No.
Apparently not
to know more, Joanna.
I need fresh air.
Wait, no!
Will, please.
Will.
Still not attending?
What a mess. Let's go home
Will see if it's there.
Come on, Marni.
Let's take the car.
Destiny, is not it?
Lady, do not forget your video.
Your video?
Sorry, just wanted Will
knew the truth.
He wanted to protect him.
I know you said to forget.
But I could not.
I'm taking the car.
I'll find Will.
What did you do?
We'll talk about it at home.
Okay.
Go away, okay?
-Look ... I did not want ...
"You ...
It is very cynical, you know?
Sorry, I'm cynical?
You who came here
pretending nothing happened.
Pretending that neither
we knew.
And Tim? How do you know that?
Did not know it
was crazy.
Please, that's why
who invited you.
But that video?
That was great.
You know what?
Really underestimated.
I thought we could start over,
but no.
I was so stuck in the past
he could not let go.
I wanted
a sincere apology.
E-I.
"It was in high school!
You do not understand!
Any idea how those years
torture affected me?
Every day at school
was torture for me.
Thank you. Can not ruin
someone's life
and pretend it never happened.
Just ruin
my life!
Understand that?
The fact that you
here now ...
Hoping that I feel
sorry for you?
It is priceless.
Sorry, let me
talking to herself?
I will.
Great job.
Like mother, like daughter.
How?
She blew it on
more important for Joanna.
Just broke her heart.
Sounds familiar?
Did you see the video?
"I saw.
Great time
during the rehearsal dinner.
You. ..
"I will not do that here.
-Fine with me.
Come on.
Marni!
Marni!
Are you crazy?
What do you think?
I think my brother was smart
falling out when he could.
The cat showed its claws.
Two can play that game.
Warming.
Preparing me.
Gifts!
Do not you love it?
Marni, let alone ...
Failure to do so.
No, no!
Marni, please no!
It was an expensive gift.
Do not do it.
Marni.
No need to send
thank you note.
Regret it.
Always wanted to be strong
enough to face it.
Know how
I'm done today?
I need not face it.
Not worth it.
You're a liar
and petty.
My family
will be better off without you.
Will is better off without you.
I'm tired of you.
You're pathetic.
Stop!
What are you doing, Joanna?
I went back to see
if you were okay.
I was worried about you.
From what it seems you can
take care of itself.
I can not believe I fell in love
for someone like that.
You were so humble, so good.
Now I feel stupid.
Because I thought I knew
who you were.
You know who I am Will,
you know!
Yes, I know Joanna
who you are.
You're a bully,
and you liar.
Emotionally ...
Quiet, Marni!
It is also your fault.
"No, Will!
-Stop talking to me!
Acting behind my back.
Armando the circus.
How could you do this to me?
How?
What's wrong
with you?
Sorry, Will,
sorry.
Do not want to hurt him.
I wanted to tell the truth, I swear.
Do not understand.
Still does not understand.
I do not care
as it was in high school.
I do not care if she was engaged,
I do not care about anything.
The important
is that you lied.
You lied!
You lied to me.
Who will marry me tomorrow?
Who is she?
She's the girl who sang
on the beach?
Because I love this girl.
I love her very much.
Or is that girl,
high school in Ridgefield.
Wait,
Will, please do not.
Please.
You, come blaming me?
You, come blaming me?
What happened to us?
Tell me.
You sincerely
do not you?
I remember everything.
Do not remember that we were
best friends
and that in high school all the time
I was competing with you.
Competing with me?
It was not a competition.
Of course it was,
you always won.
I won because they
vote for me.
Remember when
was a cheerleader?
Did I do the tests,
and accepted you and I do not.
You were great.
Please! And let's not
forget about Chris.
I knew how
wanted to be in the band.
But of course
also decided to try.
I always wanted to be music,
ever.
Please
can not even sing!
You always wanted to be everything
cheerleader ...
The drama was to be mine.
But it never worries me.
Since high school
only cares about you.
What should I do,
Ramona?
Take it easy,
so you can achieve?
That's right.
Do not push me.
Are you crazy?
You stole
Rich Phillips of me!
Rich Phillips?
The season of high school?
I was in love with him.
"I was in love with him?
-And you went to the prom with him.
"He invited me and Ramona!
-You were my friend!
Was to refuse!
So I could never
count on you.
I promised myself
never let someone
do with me what you did.
I need to thank her.
Thank you, worked hard
to achieve what I have.
Good for you.
What is.
I have won it all
and be beautiful, crazy.
Want to know, Ramona?
Honestly.
I'm proud of you.
Proud of who won.
And what you have done lately.
But my family
is my achievement.
I do not envy you.
I have a family that loves me.
I am very happy.
Great, everything is happiness.
Okay.
I'll leave.
I was jealous.
You had everything and it was beautiful.
He was smart.
Everyone wanted to be your friends.
When I saw you that night
with his entire family.
It reminded me
my marriage ended.
Joanna was everything I had.
Now you take it
although too.
I'll never be happy.
She will marry his son.
Sorry, Ramona.
Really.
I obviously should not
have done that.
I knew what I was doing.
I was so busy
and Gail.
All I know is that I was
insensitive and poor friend.
And I'm sorry.
I do not believe that I changed
the look for her.
-Changed?
Sure they've changed!
Do not remember all
hair that big?
Her hair swayed
and I was envious.
I'm so happy.
-She was very beautiful.
"Really?
I can not believe I cut
my hair!
What is happening here?
I'm disappointed
with the behavior I saw today.
Do not pretend, I have concerns
on the feminine universe.
To be more specific
it confuses me too.
But here's what I know:
Marriage is the time
families come together.
And for some reason,
that marriage is destroying
our family.
Will is gone.
Ramona is on the street
the search for Joanna.
This weekend
is a disaster.
And I'm the only one I say.
You two are totally
out of control.
"But ...
"But ...
But ... nothing.
Are grounded,
go to their rooms.
What?
No.
No.
Joanna.
Do not do it.
No. ..
Joanna, place the cream
cheese on the floor.
It will not help.
It's full of carbohydrates.
What difference does it make?
I will not marry me even more.
I am a horrible person.
Remember me?
Ruined the rehearsal dinner.
"I'm a horrible person.
-You can stop, Marni.
Stop apologizing.
I.
I deserve it all.
Hey, wait.
Joanna.
Enough. Give me that.
Let's divide.
It's cool.
Let me see.
Sounds good.
Let's divide.
It looks delicious.
I spent so much time.
So much time away from me
the person I was.
Just wanted to be somebody
my parents feel proud.
Understand?
I'm sure your parents
are proud of you.
Feel proud,
I apologize if
the moment you
walked through the door.
Just did not want Will
and their parents
I knew how it was horrible
at that time.
Much love them all.
I spent so much time thinking
we were
a real family.
Just do not want to lose them.
And I panicked.
You panicked?
And I snapped.
I was so Marni.
You'll never lose them.
They adore you.
Fits my family
better than me.
This is not true.
I think the reason why
his father loves me is because ...
He really
misses you.
Marni.
I did not expect
that I would forgive.
But I wanted
you know
I'm sorry.
Could say that
once again and slowly?
I'm sorry, Marni.
Because it is so bad ...
Why have pushed her on the court.
My God, for everything.
In fact, I ...
I'm really sorry.
Thank you, Joanna.
My God.
Still do not know what to do.
Nobody wants to talk to me.
I made a big mess.
I really can not live
without it, Marni.
I think ...
everything will be fine.
Trust me.
You can.
-Will?
-Go away!
"No, Will!
-Go away!
Wait.
Hopes for a second, Will!
"My leg.
"You okay?
-Which leg?
It's left, my bad leg.
Marni, you know what?
Hurt his leg the other day
nice try.
-Will, listen.
Marni, I do not want to hear.
Do not want to hear from you.
Ruined what would
the happiest day of my life.
"You understand?
"Yeah, got it.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Will.
Please try to accept
my apologies, because ...
The last thing I
wanted was to hurt her.
You always protected me
and I was trying to protect him.
The girl I thought
that Joanna was.
But she is no longer
that girl.
She is kind.
She is the girl who loves her very much,
you very much.
And you love her,
silly.
It's all that matters.
Sorry.
I think now is just wait.
I told the truth to Will.
What else?
No! Joanna and Will
are in the tree house.
Why are you freaking?
That's good, are getting along.
No chance.
It has to be ready
until the party on Friday.
Why do they
can not go up there?
I loosened the screws,
but have not had a chance to end.
This is bad.
Guys?
They can get down here real quick?
It is very important.
Sure.
-How are you guys?
"Hi, guys.
We're fine.
It is also important.
We will go down in minutes.
It will be sooner than you think.
At least they are together.
I'm sorry.
"You're apologizing for what?
Mama said there were termites
that ended the tree.
Termites are killers
silent.
-Halley?
"Hi, girl.
-Hey baby, how are they?
-Good news.
-Both will heal.
-Good.
The bad news is that we
to postpone the wedding.
Sorry, but no
leave the hospital today.
Except for the others.
All out,
they need rest.
"That's ridiculous.
-Doctor 's orders.
"I'm not tired.
Come on, everybody out.
Joanna?
Joanna?
Wake up, sleepyhead.
My dress.
"What's happening?
-Trust me.
No Peeking.
I'm serious.
"But what is happening?
-You will discover soon.
Can I open?
Can I open?
Open.
I know that is not marriage
fairytale I wanted.
But I hope you enjoy.
This is perfect.
-How about this?
"You're beautiful.
-Beautiful.
"You're wonderful too.
What is very good because
has anyone here who wants to see her.
Rich Phillips.
Ramona, you have not changed anything
since high school.
I hope to have changed
a little bit.
Welcome back.
Are you ready?
Marni, I attached
down the aisle?
I'll be honored.
I can not guarantee
I will not cry.
Honey, now wait
the day of your wedding.
I do not know, Grandma ...
Gotta fix

Cancel the search,

He is not my boyfriend.
Charlie is a dancer.

If not in front
I will.
Okay.

-Because your kiss
"Your kiss I can not resist </ i>
 Because your kiss
is what I miss </ i>
 When I turn out the light </ i>
I go crazy wondering
what is really to understand </ i>
 night occupies your time,
because it means more to me </ i>
 Sometimes
I forget what I'm doing </ i>
But do not forget
I want </ i>
 I want </ i>
 Repent what I did
you regret? </ i>
 I could not continue </ i>
And if you insist
on knowing my bliss </ i>
 I'll tell you this </ i>
 If you want to know
what is the reason </ i>
 Just smile when lying,
But I will say that </ i>
