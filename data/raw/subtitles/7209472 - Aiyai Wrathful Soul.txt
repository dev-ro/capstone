Can you identify yourself, please, sir?
I'm Albert Fisher,
the director for this cemetery.
Oh, just wait there, please.
Yeah, Detective Blake.
The cemetery director has arrived.
All right, thanks. Just ask
him to wait outside with you.
I'll be with him shortly.
Yeah, copy that.
- What's happen-
- Just wait a minute, please.
What's happened?
I can't really
give you any more information.
We got ya, we got ya.
It's okay, it's
okay. Deep breaths.
Can you look at me?
Are you Albert Fisher?
Yeah. Yes, I am.
I'll get you to come
with me, thank you.
What can you tell us
about Kiran Xavier?
I hired him a while ago to
help Darren in the cemetery.
He was doing a good job.
So, you know Albert, eh?
- Oh, well-
- He's a good bloke.
I've been working with him
ever since he started
this business.
Lotta years now.
So where'd you work before?
Oh, some, you know, shit
job, shit part of town.
Nothing fancy, you know?
Oh, yeah?
Well where we're going, mate,
it ain't no shit part of town.
Let me tell ya.
This place?
It's amazing. You're
gonna love it.
I can't wait.
Good.
It's killer.
- This place is huge.
- Yeah.
Not a bad place to work, eh?
Wipe your feet. Oi, come on!
Sorry.
- Got a lot to see.
- Wow.
Lot to see, mate.
Come in.
Ah, got a busy day.
Couple of functions. Guests
should be arriving shortly.
I'll take you down for a look.
Sit down, mate. Come on.
Now, we are a bit
old school here.
Albert's got this idea of
getting these fancy computers.
But bugger those things, mate.
They just baffle me, you know?
Kiran, are you all right?
You're off with the fairies.
It's a bit
overwhelming, isn't it?
I've never worked in a
place like this before, so...
Don't worry, mate.
You'll get used to it.
You're gonna like it here. Yeah.
You know what? I need you
to fill this in, okay?
'Cause if you don't,
you don't get paid.
So, Darren, do you know how much
I'll be getting paid for this?
Oh, you're talking
money, are ya?
Well, listen, once I've shown
you around the place a bit,
I'll take you over
to the big boss
and you can have that
conversation with him, all right?
Well, I'm glad to be here.
This building is
quite old, I guess.
Oh, mate.
This is one of the oldest
cemeteries in the country, yeah?
It's heritage listed.
It's very important that we
don't have any trespassers.
You understand that?
Yep.
Good. Come on.
Sign in, sign out, every day,
like clockwork. You got that?
Yep.
This is a bit
wobbly. Gotta fix that.
Over here, this is the
service schedule book.
Right.
Every job that comes
in and out is logged here.
Just write the names down?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- That'll be one of your jobs.
- Okay.
- You can handle it?
- Yeah, of course.
Uh-huh. Come.
There's a few people
that work here.
One of them's the
groundsman, actually.
That'll be interesting
for you to get along with.
Don't take it personally
if he doesn't talk to ya.
You'll see.
Now, this...
This is the real deal.
Now, this place,
it's a bit creepy.
What is it?
Well, this is where we
send people to the afterlife,
and hope they never come back.
You're
joking. What is it?
It's a crematorium, of course.
You'll be working
here quite a bit.
They'll take you through the
safety induction tomorrow.
'Cause the last thing
that we need is you
burning yourself somehow.
What? Why would I burn myself?
Don't look so worried.
Now, the most important thing
about the cremation business
is that everything we do
is well done.
Come on.
This is a funeral, right?
So we'll just hang back
here until they've finished.
You'll be all right.
Hello, boys, how are ya?
- Yeah, good.
- Let's move over here.
Kiran, nice to meet you.
Look like you're on the mend.
How are you finding things?
Really good, sir. You know,
a lot to learn, obviously.
But I'll be just fine.
Felix speaks very highly of you.
My funeral services team
never fail to amaze me.
Well, gotta say,
I'm pretty happy with the
way this one turned out.
- It's a bit of an odd one.
- Yeah?
This guy killed himself,
but he didn't leave a note,
so the family are devastated,
because they don't
know why he did it.
Yeah, right. Well,
you know what they say.
Those lost souls always have
trouble crossing over, eh?
Jesus, Darren!
We're at the chapel,
for Christ's sake.
Oh, no worry.
You know what I reckon
his favorite place is?
The crematorium.
Hope he hasn't been
laying on too thick,
giving you a hard time.
No, no, sir. It's fine, really,
it's just a bit daunting.
But I'll manage.
Well, at least
there's no chance of you
getting into any fights
with the customers here.
Hey, I gotta get
back to the service.
So, um, do a good job.
Great. Thank you
once again, sir.
I really do appreciate it.
Fighting with the customers, eh?
Can't wait to hear
about this one.
- Mm.
- Come on.
Hey, Tom, Tom. There
seems to be a bit of problem.
Piss off.
Get up!
Get up, you piece of shit.
Huh? You like that, do you, huh?
No.
- Huh?
- No.
That's for the missing
meth, you piece of shit.
Get away from me, you lunatic!
Let me go.
No, you'll make it
worse for yourself.
Piss off, dickhead. I'm
not done with you yet.
I want the money.
I don't have it!
Why don't you have it? Tell
me now, why don't you have it?
Huh?
Please help, help!
No one's coming to help
you. Not that dick or nobody!
All right? So, settle
down, my little girl.
No one's coming
to help you, okay?
Again, where is the money?
I don't have it!
I must have lost it on
the way to the hospital!
You piece of shit!
If you're lying to me-I'm not.
Are you using the drugs
you're supposed to be selling?
- No!
- Huh?
What, I don't give you enough
to support your
own filthy habit?
Do you feel sick, huh?
No.
You don't want
any more? Simple.
I won't give you any more
and see if I give a shit.
Wait! Wait!
Wait. Wait.
- Get off me.
- Wait, wait.
You can't cut me off.
Why can't I cut you off?
You need me.
You like pushing
against me like that?
- Yes.
- Hm?
Do you like that, do ya?
Yes.
- Can you feel it, huh?
- Yes.
Yes.
Why do I need you?
I got a buyer
lined up for tonight.
I don't show, he moves
onto the next seller.
Yeah.
I'll tell you what.
This is your last chance.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay?
But if this is another lie,
you will regret it.
- It's not.
- You know that, don't you?
- I know.
- Huh? Huh?
I promise.
That's my good little girl.
Clean your face,
you little grot.
Hey, hey, don't worry
about him. He's all talk, eh?
Here, take this.
That's gonna get you some
pretty good dough, eh?
- Thanks.
- Yeah, I'll get your bag.
Hey, you know what?
You and me, we make a
pretty good team, eh?
Yeah.
Willy!
What're you doing?
Oh, yeah and you better have
our money by tomorrow, bitch!
Bye, Amy.
Willy!
What? She's like, she's...
Where do you want this?
If you have a shovel,
I can help you out.
Suit yourself.
You want some water?
I'm not thirsty.
Well, that's just...
Here you are.
It's all I've got.
Promise.
Promise me you won't tell
anyone where you got this.
If somebody finds out, I
could be in big trouble, okay?
And you could be
in trouble, too.
Be
Careful. Please, be careful.
I don't know how much
longer I can do this.
I'll find you tomorrow?
Tomorrow.
Kiran, Kiran. Come
on, have a seat.
Where's Michael?
There he is.
Okay, boys, I know we had
a hectic couple of weeks,
so the beers are on me.
That's it.
Yeah, give us that.
Hey, uh, what's up with
him? Is he always like this?
Michael? Oh, yeah, he's
just a bit of an odd ball.
You know? He takes being a
groundsman quite literally.
You know we never seen him come
inside any of the buildings.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Beer?
Uh...
No, I'm not much of a drinker.
Oh, go on, help yourself.
Come on, mate. It's just a
couple, it's not gonna kill ya.
Apart from that, Michael's
not much company, eh?
- Uh, I'll just have a peanut.
- Oh, I'll get the hard stuff.
Yeah, right-o.
What? You guys don't
drink back home?
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me, mate?
Hey, buddy, listen.
I wanna have a little
chat with you, all right?
Now, I know you've just started,
you're doing an
all right job, but,
you know I'm your boss, right?
Eh? You know that, don't you?
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.
So just keep your
eye on the ball
and just do what I say
and it's gonna be okay.
So have a bloody
drink, all right?
I'm your boss, too.
Hey? I'm your boss, too!
All right?
Hey, hey, hey.
- Have a drink.
- Calm down, calm down.
Maybe he doesn't want a drink.
Oh, he doesn't want a drink.
Hey?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, be nice.
- I'm nice.
- Darren, be nice.
- I'm nice.
- And shake hands.
Shake hands.
Kiran! Kiran, stop.
Please, wait.
Look, I hope there's
no hard feelings.
Darren says some
pretty stupid things
when he's on the hard stuff.
He probably won't even remember
what he's done tomorrow.
Hell, he's probably
already forgotten now.
Yeah, well I hope I don't
remember in the morning, either.
Yeah, of course.
Look, I just wanna...
What I'm trying to say is
he didn't mean
anything by it, okay?
We okay? Everything all good?
We'll see you tomorrow?
Nobody likes to be
treated like this, sir.
No, of course not.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Have a good night.
What're you looking at?
You're looking at me again!
- Come on, man!
- Huh? You like that?
- No!
- Huh?
You like that, you little shit?
Hey, Tom-
- Shut up!
Get up. Get up!
Who was that guy?
Huh? Who's that guy?
No one! Just another buyer.
You're bullshitting me.
Why are you
bullshitting me, huh?
I didn't!
Do you wanna add
another little scar
to your collection, huh?
Then stop bullshitting
me, all right?
Are you smoking ice
with that shit, huh?
Who was that guy?
No one.
Piss off!
You like this, huh?
Do you like this pain?
'Cause I'm enjoying
it! I'm loving this!
Oi! You bastard!
Piss off, you
mongrel! Get him, Willy!
Where do you think you're
going, you little shit, huh?
Get up.
Oi!
How you like that, scumbag?
Huh?
Huh? This is my
hood, do you hear me?
Tommy! She's gone!
Go, you idiot!
Okay, so-
- You got this.
Thank you.
Here's your menus. I'll
be with you right away.
Thanks.
Hey, Pops. Must
be hungry, huh?
Thank you. You're so kind.
It's okay. You
enjoy that food, okay?
Sorry, I have to take this.
Hey, mate. Have you
got any more leftovers?
I'm starving, hey.
I'm sorry, buddy. I've got
no more food to give you, okay?
Oh, really?
Hey hey,
buddy. How's it going?
I can smell food.
What can you do to help out
a couple hungry friends, huh?
Listen, I've got
no food for you guys.
Oh, come on now.
I'm sure there's
something in here for us.
You don't just look after
old homeless men, do ya?
Hey, it's policy, okay?
I've got no food left.
Hey, policy or no, it doesn't
the fact that we're hungry.
Get!
I'm sensing you're not
feeling very generous.
- Oh, look at this place!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Please, please.
Get off me!
It's assault if you
touch me again. Pot!
Come on, make me something!
Make me some, I know!
Make me some chips, come on!
Hey, you stop that!
- Make me some chips!
- Hey, I've got no chips!
Don't drink that. This,
it's not yours to drink.
Oh, it's delicious,
though! Why can't I drink it?
I'm gonna have another drink!
No!
I'll call the police, okay?
Oh, will you now, eh?
Yeah, I'll call the police.
If you don't give us
something, we'll get something.
Capice?
- Get out now!
- Get off me!
Hey, you get out of there!
Hey! What the hell's going on?
We're just looking for
some leftovers, arsehole.
What did you call me?
That's how we do it!
Come here!
Get out! Huh!
Yeah! Close the door!
Let's lock it.
What're you
gonna do about a job?
I don't know, Felix.
You've lost two jobs in a month.
Felix, I...
Please, just pay my rent for
the next two weeks, okay?
I'll pay you back.
Please.
Okay.
Darren!
Hey! Shit, Michael.
Dude, where's Darren?
I don't like questions.
Okay, well, do
you have the keys?
Give me the keys
back when you're done.
Crackpot.
Oh, beautiful. Okay.
What the hell?
Darren?
Oh, god.
G'day, this is Darren's phone.
Now, I know you're dying
to get hold of me...
- Hello.
- Hi, Darren, it's Kiran.
What do you want?
I'm just calling about the
furnace in the crematorium.
It's just not, uh,
it's not working.
I don't know what's
wrong with it.
Could you come in and
have a look at it?
Mate, it's fine.
Listen...
Just follow the instruction
manual on the wall, all right?
It's really straightforward,
okay? It's fine.
I did, okay? I
mean, it looked easy enough.
I've gone through it
a couple of times,
but it's still not working.
I mean, we have to get
this sorted, otherwise,
we're gonna be in big
trouble, there's a-
- Keep trying for the next
30 minutes, all right?
If it doesn't work then,
then just call me back, okay?
I've gotta go.
Okay.
Wait, one second,
one second. Um...
Were you in here last
night by any chance?
'Cause your office is
like really messed up.
No. No, mate, I've um...
I've been a bit under the weather
since yesterday all right?
Okay, well, I can't
really explain it,
but it looks like a
cyclone's gone through it.
Maybe we were broken into?
Should I call the police?
The cops? No,
no, mate.
It's probably just Albert
looking for something.
Hey, I'll tell you what.
I'll come in and, uh,
I'll give you a hand
and I'll see you in
20 minutes, all right?
All right, cool.
I'll see you then.
Hi.
Hi.
This is how you found it?
Yeah.
Anything missing?
I don't know. I mean,
it's hard to tell.
Had Albert been in today?
- I haven't seen him today or-
- Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure. It was
just me and Michael work-
- Okay, okay, okay.
Listen, I'm gonna go
down to the furnace
and fix up whatever
it is you screwed up.
- I didn't do-
- Listen to me!
Just don't touch
anything in here, okay?
Nothing in my office.
All right, just go
downstairs, and clean up.
- Okay.
- All right?
Good lad.
Oh, shit.
What the fuck is this?
Come on, you...
The fuck is that?
Oh, bullshit.
Oh, shit!
Fuck!
Help me.
This guy's heart's
going a mile a minute.
We got ya.
Deep breaths.
Good. Just keep breathing.
I'll get you to come
with me, thank you.
Do you recognize this?
Um...
Yeah, that's Darren's.
Where'd you get that?
Oh, my god.
I don't get it, um...
He wasn't even supposed
to be there this morning.
And why was that?
He called in sick.
What about you? Where
were you this morning?
Me? Um, I, I...
I went to the bank, first thing,
then I went home
and I did invoices.
Then the next thing I know,
the police are calling me.
Look, Mr. Fisher. There was
a murder on your property.
Know of any reason for Darren's
office to be ransacked?
Ransacked?
I didn't even know
it was ransacked.
Can you think of any reason
why someone might
wanna kill Darren?
No, he was just a really nice,
likable guy.
Dig in.
Kiran, it's your favorite.
Come here.
That one, in there.
And this one.
There you go. You got it.
Kiran!
Kiran, Kiran, Kiran!
Kiran, Kiran!
Felix, be careful with him!
I've got him.
Have you got him?
It's okay, it's all right.
It's all right, it's all right.
Hey.
How're you feeling?
Do you feel any better?
'Cause I know today's
been a big day.
So we don't have to talk, okay?
If you don't wanna
talk, that's fine.
But you can talk to me.
Okay?
You're not gonna get in trouble.
Nothing bad is gonna
happen, all right?
I'm just so happy you came home.
Hey.
Look at me.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Let me see.
Kiran.
It looks way worse
than you told me.
It's fine.
You told me it was no big deal!
It's no big deal.
It's just a scratch.
That is not just a scratch.
Talk to me.
You know I just came from
the uni administrations?
Do you know what they told me?
What'd they say?
I've got two more weeks to
pay my uni fees or I'm out.
I mean, that's my
entire education.
We make two weeks work,
okay? We'll figure it out.
We always figure something out.
- How am I gonna do it?
- I don't know!
But I don't wanna hear it, okay?
I don't wanna hear
this negative attitude.
Did I say it right?
It's gonna be so much
better than washing dishes
at that stinky restaurant.
Mm!
Will you call me tonight?
I'll see you tonight.
I've got a big exam
tomorrow. I'm sorry.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Sara.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
Are you okay?
No.
Felix, I'm not okay.
I'm really worried.
It's like...
Like I can see the fear
and pain in his eyes.
Okay? He's not himself.
I mean, you saw him.
He's gonna be fine.
All right?
He's gonna be just fine.
Don't worry about anything.
You're fine.
Okay?
Shit.
Better get back to the dorm.
Will you promise me that you'll
take care of him tonight?
Trust me. I got this.
- Thanks, Felix.
- No worries.
Okay.
Check this out.
- Oh, look.
- Money!
- Oh, yeah, man.
- Huh?
- I told you.
- Heaps of it, too.
There you go.
Oh.
What're you gonna
do with yours, mate?
Some time from you sunshine!
Oh, what's this
shit? I need more, man.
Well, how about next time
you hit him up for more, huh?
How does that
sound, genius? Huh?
Yeah, well, you know
what? Maybe I will, then.
Yeah, good, good!
You little dick.
Oi! It's you again!
What are you, you freak?
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Willy, quick. Get up.
Willy! Get up!
Let's get him! Come on, Willy!
Stop you freak!
I got this.
Come here, you mongrel!
Hey! Come back!
Face me like a man!
Where you goin'?
Where are you? Huh?
I'm gonna carve you up big time!
Oh, Kiran. Kiran,
Kiran, Kiran, Kiran!
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, what happened? What
happened, what's going on?
Hey, hey, look at me.
It's just me, just me.
What happened to you?
Come on, we're gonna get you
up. We're gonna get you up.
Felix!
Felix, come here!
Did you see this?
Oh, my god.
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, what happened?
I was gonna ask you
the same thing, Felix.
Weren't you watching
him last night?
I checked on him, Sara,
before going to bed.
I didn't hear anything.
Get him up.
That's it. That's it.
Get his legs up.
Get his legs up.
What do you mean you
were watching him?
I trusted you to watch him,
Felix. Look at the floor!
Look at his feet!
I just needed a little
bit help from you.
Clearly that was
too much to ask.
It's gonna all right.
Look, I'll just take care
of him from now on, okay?
And you just take
care of yourself.
It's gonna be okay.
Hey. Hey, come here.
I'm sorry, Sara.
Felix?
It's gonna be all right.
I'm sorry I left.
I'm sorry I left you.
I'm so sorry.
I'm not gonna leave you, okay?
Hey, I'm sorry.
Kiran.
Hey, hey. What's wrong?
You look ice.
I'm gonna run a bath, all right?
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
Morning, Ma'am,
I'm Detective Blake.
This is Detective Lewis. We'd
like to speak to Kiran Xavier.
Oh, I'm afraid he's not home.
Really?
Any idea where he is?
I haven't seen him since,
um, I got here this morning.
I don't have any idea
where he is, sorry.
Sorry, you are?
Oh, I'm Sara Martin.
Kiran's girlfriend.
- You're Kiran's girlfriend?
- Mm.
So, you don't live here?
No, ma'am, I live
in a dorm at uni.
So, where was he last night?
Uh, he was just here,
sleeping when I left.
What time was that?
Um, about nine PM?
We were expecting
Kiran to be here,
given the condition he was
in when we last saw him.
Do you mind if we come in and-
- Um, I don't think I
should do that, sorry.
It's not my house and his
housemate isn't here, so-
- Just letting you know
there's another murder
at the cemetery last night.
- Another murder?
- Yes.
So you can appreciate
how important it is
for us to locate Kiran.
Of course.
So you have
a safe day now, ma'am.
Thank you, Detective.
Look, Sara, I understand
how overwhelming this must be.
Look, if there's anything
that you can think of
that can help with
our inquiries,
just call me, okay?
Thanks for your time.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Kiran!
Kiran! Kiran!
Kiran!
What're you doing?
Don't you do this to me.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Don't you do this to me.
No!
No! Please.
Come here! Come here.
Don't you leave me!
Don't you leave me!
I've got you.
There you go. Just behind you.
Yeah, okay. All right.
Okay.
Your arm, just
lift. There we go.
Felix?
Felix.
Hey!
Why is he here?
I didn't know where
else to go, Felix.
I mean, he was in the bath
and he almost drowned.
I can't take him to the dorm
and I can't leave
him by himself,
and if the cops come back,
they're definitely gonna
have a warrant this time.
What do you mean there's cops?
The cops came.
They told me there
was another murder
at the cemetery last night.
And they wanted to talk to Kiran
and I don't know why they
wanted to talk to Kiran.
Sara, we need to go to the
hospital right now, all right?
Okay.
Where's Kiran?
Kiran?
- Jesus!
- Hey, how's it goin', mate?
What the hell
are you doing here?
You were a little short last
night. I'm here for the rest.
Don't be stupid.
There is no more.
No more? Really?
That's okay.
Maybe a little birdie will
make its way to the coppers.
I'm sure they'd be
interested in your situation.
Don't you dare
try and threaten me!
Listen, shit head!
Your friend is dead.
I ain't made of money and I'm
in no mood to deal with you.
What do you mean, dead?
I saw his body at the
cemetery this morning.
He was beaten up, real bad.
Yeah, well since Tom's gone,
you're gonna have to
deal with me, then.
Piss off! You're a
piece of shit nobody.
You ain't gettin' anything.
Now, get off my property!
I'm gonna go to the cops, then!
Let's go to the cops.
Who do you think
they'll believe?
And upstanding
businessman like me,
or a homeless vagrant like you?
Now, piss off!
Cheers, Darren.
You're gonna be okay.
Kiran?
You killed Darren.
You killed him!
What do you want?
Why are you doing this?
You're crazy! You know that?
You're crazy!
No, no!
Please, please. Let me go.
You don't have to do this!
What do you want? Money?
Money, I'll give you money.
I won't tell a soul!
I promise! I promise!
What's going on?
Tell me!
Please.
What's going on?
What's going on, Kiran?
Somebody!
She's here.
Who? Who's here?
Who's here, Kiran?
What?
- Got ya, mate.
- Huh?
- Said I got ya.
- Yeah.
- I'll get you home.
- Yeah. Oh, thanks.
Little shit!
Hey, Tommy! Take
it easy on her, man!
Hey, Tommy! Take it easy, man!
She's had enough!
Shut up!
Get up, you little
piece of shit! Get up!
You're fallin' asleep, mate.
Nah, nah. Just lookin'
through the holes in my eyelids.
You're a little
bit drunk, aren't ya?
- Me?
- Yeah.
Like a freakin' pee player.
Fuckin' pee player?
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.
I'll have to pull over
and be a pee pee player.
Take it easy, Tommy!
Do you think you can
survive without me, huh?
Come on, Tommy,
take it easy on her!
You think you can
survive without me?
What do you want from...
Shit!
Fuck.
Amy?
- Shit.
- What was that?
- Oi! Huh!
- What?
Look what you just
done! Get out of the car.
Get out of the car
now, you idiot!
We're coming, we're coming.
Oh, my god!
- Oh, Jesus.
- Look at this!
- Darren, Darren!
- You just killed my girl!
What's wrong with you? We
were beside the freakin' road!
Sorry! We, we, we,
we, we didn't see her!
What do you mean
you didn't see her?
- No, we didn't see her!
- You let go of me.
You touch me again, I'm
gonna knock your block off.
- Look, we didn't see her.
- How could you not see her?
Haven't you got
lights on the car?
Yeah, it was
dark! Sorry, please.
Please.
Jesus!
Um...
Look.
You're drunk.
Are you drunk?
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
Come here, dick.
Let me smell your breath.
You're both stinking pissed.
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm calling the cops.
Please, please,
please don't call. Please.
You tell me why I
shouldn't call the cops!
Are you okay,
Amy? Are you okay?
It was an
accident! Please, please.
Are you okay?
You're okay, you're okay.
Both of you reach in your pocket
and give me all your money.
- What?
- Give me all your money, now!
Hurry up!
Here, here, here.
That, that's all I've got.
- That's it?
- That's the lot.
- You're kidding?
- That's it. No, that's it.
- What's that?
- Look-
- It's not even
worth pissing on!
I will get more.
I'll get more.
Leave me alone!
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll get more for you.
There's more where
that came from.
"Albert Fisher".
How much money do you have, huh?
Enough for her death?
Enough for that?
You know what?
This just could be
your lucky night.
She's just one of my pretty
little dealers. That's all.
A nobody.
But she was still
valuable to me.
You understand what
that means? Money!
So I'm gonna do you
deal. Both of yous.
Are you listening, you idiot?
Yeah.
You take that pretty little
body and you get rid of it.
All right?
And then you make sure
you come and find me
at Ridge Street alley.
Where?
Ridge Street alley!
Ri, Ri, Ridge Street alley!
That's right!
Ridge Street alley!
- Ridge Street alley!
- 48 hours!
That's all you've got!
48 hours, I'll be there!
- All right?
- Yeah.
If you're not back by then,
I'll be bloody calling the pigs.
- I'll, I'll-
- You hear me?
I'll be there, I'll be
there! I'll be there, okay?
Please, I'll be there.
48 hours.
I'll be there, I'll be there.
- You better be there.
- Yeah, I'll be there.
I forgot your shoe. I
have your shoe here.
Here you go, have your shoe.
I can't go to jail.
I can't go to jail.
Just let me think of something.
You're not going to jail.
Look, let me think of something.
- This is your fault!
- What?
This is your
fault. You made me drive.
Yeah. You're the one
that ran over her, not me.
Oh, you bastard.
I'm going.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?
Just let me think.
Let me think.
What did he just say?
He just said something. He
just said she's a nobody.
A nobody!
You get it?
What're you talking about?
Don't worry about it.
Just, just grab her legs.
Quick. Help me get
her in the back.
Come on, quick!
Jesus.
Grab that blanket.
And the boot.
Throw it in the back.
Darren!
Darren, get your arse out here!
Get the latch!
Let's go.
Come on.
I've got her.
Come on.
I've got her, I've got her.
All right.
Let's just get this over
and done with, okay?
She's alive!
Jesus.
Let me think.
We need to get
her to a hospital.
We need to get
her to a hospital!
No, no, no, no. No hospital.
We take her to a hospital,
we got to jail, okay?
- I can't do this.
- Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Where do you think
you're going, eh?
I thought you didn't
wanna go to jail.
I don't.
So, what do you suggest we do?
'Cause I'm not going down alone!
I don't know.
I'm gonna tell you
what we're gonna do.
We're gonna pick her up, okay?
And we're gonna get her in
that chamber, all right?
- Okay.
- Yes, good.
Go.
Help me.
She's talking.
Help me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Just get her up and
get in that chamber. Come on!
Okay.
Close the door.
Close the damn door!
Let me get her!
Let me fucking get her!
No, no!
Hey, Sara?
Is he there?
I think the cemetery's
the last option.
I'm here, but no one
seems to be around.
Yeah.
Calm down, Sara.
I'll find him.
Hang on.
Hello?
Anybody there?
Hello?
Kiran!
Kiran!
Yeah, Detective Blake.
I got blood in the front!
What're you doing here?
Answer me!
Oh!
Shit! Put your hands up where-
- Down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!
Get down on the
ground! Down on the ground!
Put your hands
up where I can see them!
Get down on the ground!
What the fuck?
