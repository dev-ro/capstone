"I cannot forget, but i

We have no money.
Go away.
You're so stuborn!

We're hungry. Jobs..
Interesting.
Got any change?
Come see

It's not for political reasons!
We're hungry! We need jobs!
Don't pull me like this! Pull

The Talibans are
coming to bring hell!
It's not for political reasons!
We're hungry! We need jobs!
WE ARE WIDOWS
Run! The Talibans are

You want to get killed?
You'll get killed. Run!
Sends the misforunes away,
in the name of the king...
and the girls. Protects
from the evil eye.
Get up!
Don't lock us here!
Heretics!
Why you came now? It's
a dangerous situation.
The hospital is closing.
The manager wants to go.
Go where? He owes me
4 months!
Let's go my love.
How am i gonna pay you?
I have no money.
So,what can i do?
Our patient is dying.
Help us!
I'm not a doctor.I'm
just the manager here.
Look at my shoes!
I can't do anything.
Government doesn't care
about us either.
I can't do anything.
The hospital is a mess.
We're hungry!We're begging you!
Leave me alone,
for Christ's sake!
My wife went out alone.
The Talibans arrested her.
It's said that the goat mourns
and the boucher for meat.
You're late.Come,my
father is not well.
Why?Isn't he
better than yesterday?
-He's worst.
-Worst?
Yes,come quick.
-Come quick!
-I'm coming!
Quick!My father is worst.
He was ok yesterday.
Now he's worst.
I'm loosing my father.
-How are you sir?
-Ok.My body's in pain.
Let's give half of yours
to this old man.
He's poor
and needs help.
We have no oxygen.
Make some air.
The Talibans are here.
What's happening?Mom!
The Talibans are here!
Are there any
foreign woman here?
No.
Who is she then?
She's with my father.
He's sick.I brought him here.
And you came with whom?
With me.
Who are you?
I'm her husband.
I am with
my sick father.
You bastard!How you let her
speak?You're the husband!
Forgive me.
Father has asthma.
I'm making some air to him.
Mom,they're gone.
Come here so they don't see you.
Take that thing out.
I'll take him home.
He will die if i take it out.
I have no choice.
If i take care of him at home,
will you pay me?
Come,God is Great.
Quick!Let's go,
before it gets colder.
Come quick and bring it.
Will you take us home?
We're gonna be late.Let's go.
I'll escort them.The
Talibans will tease them.
Stop it,you bastard!
Aren't you ashamed of having
your wife on the bicycle?
All the men will fal in love with her!
Cover your legs!
Forgive me!
I won't do it again!
Can you escort
me again tomorrow?
No,find someone else.
Don't you add more
misery to me,mom.
God took his revenge on me
allready.I am a mess.
Shame on you!I told you not to take it off.
If something goes wrong..
what will i do?
Oh God,what a misery?
I wish my husband was alive.He
was bringing the food at least.
You took him away
in the Kabul war.
I wish my brother was alive...
and not kileed in the Russin war.
He would take care of
us now, mother mostly.
Oh God,i wish i had a son
instead of a daughter.
He would work for me.
I wish God haven't created women.
What?Men and women
are exactly the same.
My hair grown white
but i saw..
that there is no difference
between men and women.
Both work the same..
and both are the same unfortunate.
A shaved man,
under the burka..
looks like a woman...
and every woman
with short hair...
and wears a pair of trousers,
looks like a man.
Bring her father's
clothes.
and cut them short.
I'll cut the hair
tomorrow...
and she will be a boy.
What re you saying grandma?
If the Talibans realize this,
they ll kill me.
Don't be afraid.
If you are careful,
you'll be a man.
You are a boy my love.
All the bad things in the
world,is in his eyes.
We all die if
you don't work.
Do you remember that
old story i used to tell you?
Once upon a time
there was a beautiful boy...
hos father was dead.
He went to work and
came back a reck.
Then he wished
he was a girl...
so he didn't have
to work.
One day The
Wise One told him...
that if he crossed the
rainbow he would become a girl.
"What's the rainbow?"he asked.
It was a souvenir from
Rastam,the big hero...
to free us from the
pain and misery.
If a boy crosses it
becomes a girl...
and if i girl crosses it,
becomes a boy.
Get up my dear.
-You belong to me.
-Pay me this Friday.
-Thank you.
-I wish you health.
Don't get upset,Sister.
My condolescences.
Mother!
Mother!
I know you.
Why you cut your hair?
Pay me or
I'll turn you in.
Hi.
Hi.
You know Rahim?
Rahim who?
-The left-handed.
-No.
The one that got killed
in the Kabul war.
How come you don't remember him?
You fought together for 14 years.
I'm his wife.
I'm sorry i don't remember.
How are you?
Good.
How's your daughter?
This boy
is my daughter.
Come from the back.
Why you got out with
all this fuss?It's dangerous.
What could i do?
I came for you.
I disguised my girl
as a boy...
so you take her
at work.
I am poor
and desperate.
My husband died as a martyre.
All i got is you and the
garden of God.
Where can i go by myself?
I opened the store
so i can earn some money...
but noone comes.
I hardly earn a
living myself
I wish
i could help.
Sent only some bred.
God bless you.
Son,come
early tomorrow for work.
God bless you.
Thank you.God
helps all.
You come back early.
Let's go son.
God bless you.
What's wrong?
Wore your sleepers.
Ok.
Soften you voice.
It's too deep.
Ok.
Don't talk.You voice
gives you away.
Ok.
Boys,it's praying time.
Do you know
how to pray?
Not like that, my son.
Look at me.
Let's go.
God is Great.
Take this and go home before
it gets dark.
Thank you.
God bless you.
Why you hit me?
Mom!A Taliban
is behind the door.
Grandma,he will kill me
if he finds out that i'm a girl.
Oh God,what am i
gonna do with you?
What have you done?
Nothing.
The Talibans suspected it.
What am i gonna do?
I didn't do anything.
Shame on you!
Do something,fast!
Eat some watermelon!
You''ll get sick
if you don't eat.
Eat something and i'll tell you...
a nice fairytail
to sleep.
You'll get sick my dear.
I'll die for you...
I love you.
Once upon a time
there was a beautiful boy...
which father was dead.
He had four sisters.
He went to work
and came back a reck.
Then he wished
he was a girl...
so he doesn't have
to work.
If he crossed the rainbow,
he would become a girl.
He asked what a
rainbow was.
The Wise Man said:"Heavenly
rainbows rise from rain."
If a boy crossed them,
he became a girl...
and if a girl crossed them
she would become a boy.
Let's go.
What's wrong Molah Sahib?
I want that boy.
-What do you want from him?
-I'm taking him.
-He works for me.
-I must take him.
Let him be,please.
He's too poor.
Poor or not,
i'm taking him.
Drink some milk,
Molah Sahib.
Drink some,please.
How are you?
Where are they taking us?
To Bin Landen,
to fight.
No,they're taking us to prison.
Get in line!
Take one each!
One at a time!
What's happening here?
They turn us into Taliban here.
They'll give us turbans.
-Will i get one too?
-Yes.
Take this turban.
How do i wrap this?
Lower a little and
I'll do it for you.
You have to learn this.
My eyes are in pain.
Who can speak of
The Saint Koran?
-I don't know it.
-Don't speak so loud!
The dog barks.
Get up and chant!
Do it!Don't be a coward!
Get up.
Give me your hand.
Put me down.Fast!
Get me down!I'm falling!
Come down...slowly..
Place you feet
on my shoulders.
Coward!Girl!
You know why i am
here today?
To teach you.
The lesson is that
you have a wet dream.
Something comes into your sleep.
Then you'll become men
and then you must take a bath.
There are many
"bath" ways.
A wet dream,
a prayer one...
and i'll show you
how we do it.
First you wash
your hands.
First right and
then left hand...
and then your testicles.
Got it?
I'll show you how,now.
This is for the head.
Got it?
This is the testicle you
must wash.
I didn't quite get it.
Only got knows if
this is the right way.
It's under his control.
Three time
the right side...
Three times
the left side...
and three times the in-between.
That's the way.
Come here.
Everybody pay attention now!
You won't experience
this again.
Watch carefully.Noone
has ever done this beofre.
And try to learn it.
You must wash
underneath here.
You don't need to
know which side...
cause it's right there,
hanging in the middle.
Now we pour water
three times,got it?
There must be plenty of
water.A river maybe.
Dive.
My foot is bleeding,
Molah Sahib.
Wash your feet first,
then you can take a bath.
Come here to
wash your feet.
Take off you clothes.
Forget about the pain.
Take off your shoes.
Get your feet naked.
Wash'em.Take off your
clothes.Take a bath.
Oh God,what a wonderful feeling!
Do you want me to
wash your feet?
Don't you get it?
3 times right,3 times left
3 the in-between.
This boy looks
like a bride.
What's a bride,
Molah Sahib?
Brides are the female
spirits in the sky.
It's a girl.Everything
look girlish.
I'm definite
it's a girl.
It's a boy.
Boy.Bastards!
She looks at men.Let
him be!You bastards!
If it's like that,
what's his name?
Osama.
-We'll search him.
-I don't think so!
It's a just a kid.
Go!
-Where is he gone?
-What?
-Where is my boss?
-Pakistan.
Didn't managed too good.
You keep that so
you're warm.
Did he said where
he was heading?
I came back from school
and a neighbour said...
that he went to Pakistan.
What do we do now?
Don't worry.When a door
closes,another hundred open.
Our neighbour is having
a wedding ceremony tonight.
Wear your dress and
we'll go work there.
Give me the picture of the
groom holding a sword.
Thank you.
-Where is the groom?
-Went to Iran.
Talibans are at the doors!
Wear your burkes!
What's happening
in this house?
My mother died.
Listen.Forget the war
lessons afterwards.
His face
is girlish.
His feet
are girlish.
Listen to his voice.His hands
are girlish.
Get away from here!
I'm not a girl.
You lied to us yesterday.
You are a girl.
Espandi!
Espandi!
What's wrong?
Why you tease him,
you bastards?
You lied to us.
I didn't lie to
anyone.Go away!
He's not a girl.
He's a boy.
Then he must
climb to the tree.
Climb to the tree,Osama.
He looks like a girl.
He's a boy and he
can climb to that tree.
Espandi!
He's not a girl.
He's a man.
Espandi!
Come this way.
Come close.
I'm falling.
Up!
Mother where are you?
Get up.
He's a girl!
She's a girl!
Get her!
In the name of the father...
People that came to see.
We gathered here for
our religious laws.
To see what's happening
in Kaboul.
This unfaithful reporter
took shots from everybody.
He was spying
on the noble Talibans.
We have our witnesses
and evidence.
Take him.Death is the punishment!
Death is the punishment!
Judge ordered the death
penalty for him.
This unfaithful woman
was swearing.
The judges decided that stones
must be thrown at her until she dies.
-Where is the witness?
-Only God knows.
Bring the girl that
pretended to be a boy.
Whoever does this,
will conclude like him.
In our Holy Islam has never
happened anything like this.
We have seen many bad things...
in Kaboul like we see today.
I forgive her.
May you life and
faith go on forever
This orphane girl
doesn't have anyone.
I marry her to you...
legally and in a religious way.
Do you accept?
I accept.
Judge,don't give me
to him,please.
I want my mother.
Bring me my mother.
May God reward you.
They forgave her and
Molah Sahib took her.
Now justice has prevailed.
Praise the Lord.
God is Great!
Come on.
May God bring
hell to the Talibans.
They burnt our house,
our land,our garden.
We have
nothing left.
They arrested me and
the married me to this Molah.
They ruined my life.
I don't have a reason to
live.Oh God,please help me.
Look.At the beginning
we became refugees.
Afterwards,the Talibans took
my brother and killed him.
Then i was thrown to Molah.
I wish he dies.
At night i was painting my
hands with henna...
he forced me to run away
and marry him.
My life is black
and miserable.
I hate but
what can i do?
He took my life
the night we were married.
All my youth was destroyed
by that man.
Where is the girl?
I'll find hetmyself.
Come on!
Choose.
Look and choose.
You don't like these.
This one is for you.
It's yours.
