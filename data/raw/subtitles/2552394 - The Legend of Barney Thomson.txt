[Barney Thomson]:
I've got two styles--
short back and sides.
and back and sides.
I start at the crown.
and work outwards methodically.
I like
a calm working environment.
Every barber has his quirk...
well. except me.
We not got any.
Don't see the point. really.
Head down...
get on with it.
That's me.
I prefer it
when they don't speak.
I cannae be bothered
speaking to them either.
I like the quiet.
So what makes a legend.
do you think?
Heroism?
Well. that rules me out.
Self-sacrifice?
Not your man.
Nobility of purpose?
Can't help you there. either.
My life's always been boring.
I don't mind that.
There's a place
for being boring.
Cuttin' hair is boring;.
8min' at home is boring;.
That was all right.
I was a boring kind of guy.
If you'd asked me back then.
Yd have said I was content.
Smilin' in the comet.
the rain
runnin' down my neck.
Then fate decided
to leap on my back.
and I turned round and saw
that I'd been nothing
all these years
but a howling ghost.
From nowhere I was alive.
I'd never had to
deal with the law before.
Only had to look at a police
and! shafted.
But circumstances changed...
and. suddenly. I had my very own
one-to-one copper
breathing down my neck.
Everywhere I turned.
there he was--
this big slab of bastard
staring right back.
Yeah I was alive all right.
but for how long?
I'm Barney Thomson.
and this is the story
of what happens
when you move chairs.
...I'm telling ye.
[Wullie]: He's not
in the Lynch league yet.
R 7 wins. and I'm talkin'
the [are-nutrition years.
14 knockouts on a diet
of lrn Bru and dogfood.
[Barney]:
Comics by the door, Charlie.
[Charlie]: Thanks, Barney.
[Chris]: Sweetheart.
What you talkin' about?
Don't believe that.
She's a fuokin' liar.
I wasn't at Karen's.
I had to go the hospital.
A shadow on my lung.
Hah, nah. It's fine.
They gave me tablets.
What are we doin' tonight?
Maybe you can
come by again,
and I could gie ye
another "Maryhill Moothfae"--
[Barney]: Oh! That's fuoki n'
disgusting.
[Chris]: All right. Darling.
See you in a bit. Bye.
Right, up you come.
[Barney]:
Doesn't even make sense.
Barney...
can I have a wee chat?
Aye.
All this chatter
must be bothering ye, eh?
What?
Well, the boxing chat.
Is it bothering ye?
Ooh.
I think you might be. uh...
might be hep-pier up here.
- What, there?
-Aye.
Let me get this straight.
I was in the vvindae
for eight years,
then I was in the second chair.
then the third.
Flow you want me
oot by the bins'?
I mean. that--
that's not even
a fuokin' barber's chair!
[Bead curtain rustling]
Fuck!
[Wullie]:
You have nae patter, Barney.
Flee sparkle.
You hang over the customers
like a shitty cloud.
Soaring 'em away,
standing there
like a big streak of piss.
It's like
you've had a charisma bypass.
You look like a haunted tree.
That's all I'm saying.
Well, your dad brought me
into this shop 2O years ago.
I'd like to hear
what he has to say about this.
Eh?
Right.
Let's get my da on the phone.
[Curtain clatters]
I'm a fuokin'...
haunted tree?
[James Henderson]:
Shitty cloud...
Big streak of piss...
He's standing there
like a haunted tree.
Nae patten.
[Slam]
[Chipper background chatter]
All right, who's next?
I'm gonna wait
for Chris, thanks.
[Barney]: Yourself?
What about you?
I'm just vvaitin' for Wullie,
if that's all right.
That's, uh... that's fine.
Actually, no.
It isnae bloody all right. Ho.
Plot one of you want to get
your hair out by m e'?
Am I--
Am I that bad?
What you want to wait
for these two for?
It's half-past three already.
You'll no all get seen!
Are you Inental?
Come on, Barney.
That's out of order.
What is this?
Some kind of conspiracy?
First, you bump me
intae the back of beyond.
- Then you tell this bunch of--
-Wankers?
To-- to refuse
my services?
Is that it?
Ye oannae have a go
at the customers.
[Barney]:
Ah! Fuck this. Wullie.
Fuck this!
What's the point
of me even fucking being here?
Fuck it!
[Barney bashing around in back]
Fuck!
Flever a dull moment, eh?
[Men laughing]
[indistinct Dante-ring resum es]
[MacPherson]:
The lab results came back. sir.
T hey re negative.
[Holdall]: Brilliant.
[MaoPhersolw]: What are you
gonna tell the public?
[Holdall]:
The public can fuck off.
[Male Reporter]:
To date, there have been
five victims
from the Glasgow area
and you haven't been
able to make a connection
between any of them.
[Female Reporter]: You don't
even know where the bodies are,
except the bite the killer
sent to the ne:-:t of kin.
[Male Reporter]: This oase-
should be given to someone
with more local knowledge.
[Female Reporter]: What
exactly are you doing all day?
[Questions overlapping]
Late last night...
officers from this station
came into possession
of a valuable
piece of evidence...
the exact nature of which
I am not at liberty
to divulge.
[Reporters olamourirwg]
[toilet flushing]
[MaoPhersolw]: So what's this
new piece of evidence, sir?
[Holdall]: Nothing. I lied.
Which is why
I'm in the shape of a frog.
[MaoPhersolw]: The Superintendent
wants to see you.
Of course he does.
[Molvlanamalw]:
What are you playing at, 1Z7?
If you walk into
a room backwards,
with your trousers
round your ankles.
Don't be surprised
if you get bummed rotten.
And never. never drag the force
in with you.
I'll not have my team
mass-bummed
on your say-so!
Is that clear?
Don't interrupt me.
You've got the whole country
thinking we've just about
got this thing wrapped up
when. as far as I can see.
In the two months--
two fucking Inonths
you've been on this case--
you've Inanaged to narrow
your list of suspects down to
"People in the Glasgow area
who've been to the seaside
in the last 12 weeks."
The killer will
think we're onto 'im,
and might make
a mistake. sir.
He'd fucking well better.
Fucking Molvlanamalw.
He's got to fill
his day up somehow.
I mean. his in-tray
consists of
staring out the window
whilst having a gentle wank
over The Daily Star.
What's the
big breakthrough?
Fuck off!
It's my case.
Is it an actual breakthrough.
Or is it just
a vve-made-it-up breakthrough?
What the fuck is that?
Inspiration!
Oh, I been meaning to ask ya,
how's "Operation:
Touchy Little Boy' coming on'?
Do you want to do this
right now?
'Cause I'm fucking
well up for it!
Get your tits
out of my face.

[Crowd cheering]
Come- on. number $I:1:.
Come- on. number $I:1:!

You fucking wee shite!
Fucking... fucking dog.

H 0t m e.
You not put

You didn't put any on.
[Barney]: Crap.
They talk crap all day.
Box-zing.
That's their sole currency.
You know, I was in that vvindae
for eight years.
That Inealwt something.
I'm 50, Charlie.
What the fuck happened there?
I mean, it's every man's right
to reach
his full potential. Right?
But it passed me by.
Aye.
What am I gonna do?
Pl 0th I n g .
I've got a mother
that's digging her claws in
like an auld buzzard.
I live in
a shite-y, wee flat.
And the last time
with a bird,
"Shakilf Stevens"
was number one.
I've not had
my kick at the ball.
All I've got is that job.
The bastards are trying
to take- it away from me.
[Charlie]:
You want them to like you?
[Snickers]: Like me?
I want to fuokin' kill them.
Pew!
[Chuoklirwg]
[Molvlanamalw]: He's fucking
laughing at us, 1Z7.
[Holdall]: Yes, sir.
[Molvlanamalw]: The public
are gonna string us up
for this. you realize.
[Holdall]: Yes, sir.
[Molvlanamalw]: Right.
I'm replacing you as lead.
What?
And you. 529.
Ho, sir.
it's ZOpast10, sir.
Is it?
529's your fucking number!
You're off the case as well.
You'll be taking orders
from 119 from now on.
Thank you, sir.
[Molvlanamalw]: Just take me--
uh. take me
through your plans, uh. 119.
[Robertson]:
He'll strike again, sir.
So we'll find out
who's recently disappeared.
Who last saw them.
I'll put Holdall here
out in the field.
Investigating
the missing person files.
[Holdall]: Don't you think
we should be looking
for the rest of him?
[Molvlanamalw]:
119's in charge now, 1Z7.
Is that plate
from the canteen?
[Grun1bling]Ah, fuck me.
Tell forensics to get
their own fucking plates!
I'm not eating off a plate
that's served up a human arse.
Right. Off you go.
Oh, ho. ho!

They'd talk about this legend

Well. careful

[Wullie]: Barney.
[bl-idly]: Barney!
A wee word?
I'm not really sure

He wants to give him a job.
[Barney]: Eh?
[Wullie]: Cannae have ye

And we can't have

- Oh, no. that was a one-off.
-That was not a one-off.
You have regular outbursts.
[overlapping conversation]
You cannot talk

It's not myfault

It was Wednesday. Thursday?

All right, lads.
You might want

We're a man down.
[Holdall]: I know.
I'm Detective Inspector Holdall.
This is Detective Sergeant
MQOPHGFSOH.
We'd like to have a word about

We won't keep you.
Oh, ho. ho. ho. ho. ho.
Benny Lynch... mm?

Can we sit down?
Yes.
Chris, could you
finish the customer?
Sit down?
I'm fine.
L-I'm fine standing.
This is purely
a missing persons investigation,
Mr. Thomson.
A Mrs. Henderson
reported her husband missing
yesterday afternoon.
Ivlrs. Henderson says
you were the last person
to talk with Mr. Henderson.
Is that correct?
Yes.
How, there's no need
to be so nervous,
Mr. Thomson,
This is-
- I quite Llnderstalwd.
-...Routine.
I quite Llnderstalwd.
Did Mr. Henderson tell you
where he was going?
He-- He said something
about, uh...
going to the shops.
Uh. he asked me to look up.
and then he... left.
Was it normal
for Mr. Henderson
to go to the shops after work?
You know,
I-I-I don't really know
wh-what Mr. Henderson
did outside of work.
Because we weren't really
friends.
Wasn't really friends.
Mm-hmln.
Um, did you suspect
that something
might have happened
to Mr. Henderson?
I quite Llnderstalwd.
Sorry?
[Barney]: Slip of the tongue.
you know how it is.
What?
Speaking to the police.
You know, this?
You know-- heh...
You-- You feel guilty.
Even though you--
you've never done nothing wrong.
I mean, it's not as if
I've stabbed Wullie
with a pair of scissors
or anything like that, you know?
[Barney giggles nervously]
[Coughing]
Would-- Would you like
a glass of water?
[Trying to suppress cough]
[high voice]: Ho, I'm fine.
[Holdall]: Where was
your colleague,
Mr. Porter, when you wasn't
stabbing Mr. Henderson
with your scissors?
Oh, he-he-he left early.
Because we weren't
very busy that day.
That bit about the stabbing?
That was just a joke.
[Holdall]: You think
this is funny, Mr. Thomson?
Hot at all.
[Laugifi]
I'm onlyjoking.
You have no idea
how nervous you look!
[Stops laughing]
Did Mr. Henderson
tell you
that he was not
gonna have you
in the shop anymore?
I have no knowledge of that.
See, Mr. Henderson's father
says that Mr. Henderson
was gonna tell you about it
yesterday.
Did he say
anything to you?
H o.
[Holdall]: Oh, well!
That's us.
Would you send
Mr. Porter in, please?
Yes.
[Holdall]: Oh.
I used to sometimes
hide in toilet cubicles,
you know, convinced
I was about to die.
And I went
to see this man.
Do you know what
he said to me'?
He said the biggest
instigator
of a panic attack ism?
Guilty conscience.

Two days, all-in.
Including breakfast
and your evening lneal--
42 pounds!
You believe that?
How did
you manage that'?
You chopped him up!
You've even
fucking labelled him!
I label everything.
[freezer humming]
[arm thuds]
[thump]
[bell jingles]
James?
[James]: Barney.
On the button.
Appreciate that.
I'll be here until
that eon of mine decides
to show hie face again.
Right.
Wife's convinced
that killer's got him.
Could be posting his bavvs
from Arbroath as we speak.
Aye.
It doesn't compare
to what he'll get
when I get my hands on him.
You look hellish.
You found yourself
a woman yet?
P] a h .
That's a fucking empty
existence you've got there.
Is it no?
Sometimes.
[keyjiggles in look]
[James]: Minute late, Porter.
Hot impressed.
Sorry. Mr. Henderson.
I was. eh...
I was coming
along the green there
and I was threatened
by a bunch of, LIITI... wasps.
[Clicks radio on.
rook music plays]
[James]: Get that shite off.
[Radio clicks off]
Did, uh...
VVLHHGâ€œ have a chat with you
the other day'?
Well, did he say anything
about anything?
Hot that I can think of.
Ahh.
Glad to hear it.
[Robertson]: Up, down, up, down!
Are we a team?
[Officers]: Yes!
- Let me hear ya! Are we a team?
-Yes!
[Robertson]: For fuoKs sakes.
Two, three, four...
five. six. seven...
[Holdall]: Everybodys looking.
This is the heart attack
capital of Europe.
Look at the state of you!
You look like
a depressed milkmaid.
[Holdall]: What is this?
The "River Dance" branch?
Update me.
[Holdall]: The barber, Thomson.
He was a bit weird.
I think we should have
another shot at him.
[Robertson]:
What's his connection
to the other victims?
Mm. I just think
he's holding something back.
[Robertson]: Spare me
your woman's intuition.
Go on.
Go and check on
Inissing persons.
One, two, three!
Fuck off.
[Robertson]:
Show me what you've got!
Face the front!
Tits and teeth!
Teeth and tits!
One. two. three...
Hiya, Barney.
Hey, Charlie.
I'm doing my sum mer
job tonight.
They need two folk on it.
Aye?
Funny, ain't it?
Wullie wanting you
out the window,
you saying
you wanted to kill him,
and him disappearing.
What are you saying?
-It's funny.
-What's funny?
You'll come tonight.
The faifis in town.
[rides Whizzilwg. fair buzzing]
[Man]: Roll up. roll up.
All the fun of the fair.
Step right up.
Tighten your seatbelts.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.
Try and look as if
you're having a great time.
We're trying to
attract punters here.
See, the thing is,
I need to be ohulnmed-up,
otherwise, I look like
one of the paedophile-s.
[Barney]: Do we nojust
look like two paedophile-s?
[Charlie]: Ahh. Right enough.
Remember, we went
to the ensue ma year?
I like fairgrounds.
I hate- circuses.
Clowns should be tortured.
And as for mime-s...
I'd strangle the bastards.
Uh, two hotdogs,
with onions.
Barneys paying.
Listen, Charlie, come here.
I was thinking. Um...
You see. all that talk
the other day, up at yours,
it was just talk.
I know. I know.
I know!
I helped you put
that bag in your oar.
What?
That was the last night
Wullie was seen, was it no?
Fuck off. W--
I didn't kill Wullie!
Ho. Ho, I know that.
I'm just saying.
And a big Coke!
Barneys paying.
Aren't you, Barney?
Fuck off!
I don't even know
why I fucking bother
hanging about with you.
Look at the state of you.
Mental bastard.
Shouldnae have said that.
[James]: Aye. That's me
away for the day. boys.
Ivloirefs frantic about Wullie.
I'm taking her
to the doctor's,
see if he can give her
something to knock her out.
I'm gonnae kick his arse
from here to fuokin' doomsday.
[door bell jingle-s]
[radio playing softly]
Maybe a wee
online gambling habit
that got out of hand?
You think?
Ooh, I don't know.
You could be onto
something there.
Right enough.
Wullie's mad keen
on the boxing.
Enjoys the odd flutter.
[Bell jingle-s]
Maybe somebodys after him...
Maybe he's taken to the hills.
You know...
you may have hit on
something--
(Bah. What's this
about a free haircut'?
Mind. Ye said.
We're about to close up.
Just get on with it.
[Chris]: Free haircut, eh?
Just said to him,
last week.
I thought he could maybe
do with a wee trim.
Eh, Charlie?
That's Llnusually
generous of you. Barney.
I'll tell you what.
Uh, you head off.
I'll look up.
Away and see
your girlfriend, eh?
What the hell am I
gonna do with this?
[Charlie]: Where's Wullie?
On his holidays?
[Barney]: Could be.
Charlie, could be.
Le that why
you needed my help
with that stuff
on Wednesday?
[Forced chuckle]
Cannot think
what you're on about.
Uh, away ye go, Chris.
I thought my hands
might get burnt
by they chemicals.
But they're fine!
[Chris]: What chemicals?
[Barney]: Well...
Wullie and I
did the tidy-up.
And I took the rubbish out.
Charlie helped me.
But there--
there was chemicals.
I thought
you were leaving.
[Charlie]: You oouldnae lift it
by yourself, eh, Barney!
It was massive.
Massive!
Just shut up. Charlie!
Look, just let me do your hair.
[Chris]: That's him done.
[Barney]: Ho, no. look--
[Chria snaps]: He's done.
[Barney]:
Another time, Charlie, eh?
[Radio crackling]
Thanks very much.
You mind the roads now.
[Bell jingle-s]
[sports broadcast
continues to play]
[Chris]: So what was in
this "Inassive bag"
that took two
of you's to lift?
Cut a lot of heavy hair
on Wednesday?
[Barney chuckles dryly]
Well, it seemed like it.
[Chris]: Did you kill Wullie?
What?
You killed Wullie.
Didn't you?
It was an accident.
You are so fucked.
Ho. no. no. no.
I'm not bloody well
taking this
off the likes
of you anyway.
You're come swanning
in here every Inornirwg,
half an hour late,
then you spend
the rest of the day
on that phone with
some stupid wee lassie.
Have ye ever thought vvho pays
for these phone calls?
Have ye? Eh?
H o.
You make me bloody sick.
And it was an accident.
Bastard!
[Barney narrating]:
Now. there was a couple of ways
this could go.
Talking Chris out of
smashing my head in
at this point seemed unlikely.
But fate stepped in once more
and booted me
right in the balls.
[BO-ting commentary]:
...And there's the bell.'
But no one hears it.
He turns away.
He seems doubtful. muddled...
ifs all oven...
Chris?
Oh, fuck, not again.
- Muln!
-Oh.
Mum, vvh-where are you going?
I told you.
my trip with the girls!
They'll pick you up
from anywhere
if you give them
advance warning.
Ooh, two days
of indulgent bliss.
I cannot wait.
I need your help.
Ooh...
Talk to me through the door.
[Barney]: Okay.
Well...
there's been another...
wee accident.
[Cemolirwa]: What? Hey?
Speak up!
I oannae hear you!
What are you saying?
I oannae hear you!
Is this the queue?
[Barrie-y. stammers]
It's the ladies.
[Holdall]: All right.
Mr. Thomson?
[Barney]: I-l-I-low did you...
[MacPherson]: We followed you.
[Holdall]: Just as well
we turned up when we did.
Aye?
Yeah. well.
you was driving away
when we was coming
round the corner.
[chuckling awkwardly]
Oh, really.
It's funny how that--
I need to ask you
a few more questions
about Mr. Henderson.
How, what can you tell me
about associates
he might have.
He was a gambler.
He-he was a gambler.
That's right, yeah.
You know, he was always
going tae boxing matches
and casinos,
and that--
that kind of thing.
You know,
he actually owed
quite a lot of money.
Come tae think of it,
he was in
a bit of trouble.
Are you going
on your holidays?
Oh. no. no.
that's my m Inn's.
There's a coach trip.
[Holdall]: Oh.
I'm just here to make sure
she gets off safely.
[toilet flushing,
Cemolirwa groans]
Mum?
Anyway, you got to look out
for your m um, eh?
Yeah.
She'd do anything for me.
Oh...
Anything at all.
Hi, Mum.
I'd give it
a couple of minutes.
Thanks very much.
Ooh, ooh, pull back
there, Fleddy.
How, do you know
if Mr. Henderson had
any dealings
with a Stephen Murphy.
John Murter.
Richard Colquhoun.
Or a Robert Dodds?
Wait a minute.
that's they murdered folk.
I had absolutely fuck all
to do with that.
This is harassment!
I had absolutely nothing
to do with that.
And there's nothing you can say
to prove otherwise.
[groaning]
Mum! Mum!
Mum! Mum, you okay?
[groaning and moaning]
You all right?
Come and have a seat.
[moaning]
Have a seat.
Come here.
There we are.
[coughing and moaning]
Are you okay?
Mum...
[MacPherson]:
We can help you take- her
up to the hospital
if you like.
Ho, she's fine.
Best leave us to it, eh?
She doesn't look fine.
Well, it happens
all the time!
Just...
I'm better on my own.
You come down to the station
and make a list of all
Mr. Henderson's known associates
over the past six': nwnths.
And I want an account
of your whereabouts
for the last week.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Mum, you okay?
Christ.
Mum, do you want
an ambulance?
Just get
my fucking case.
But, Mum, see.
these others, it vvasnae me.
It had nothing to do with me.
You need to believe me.
[bus engine idling]
[bus radio blares]
Oh, God.
Ogh!
Ha!
[laughing]
[all cheering]
Oh! I'm here.
Oh, God.
Here, guess who's coming?
Aye, just for a wee bit
of discovery, eh?
[bus radio blaring]
I didn't win
a fucking thing that night.
[laugifi]
Mum! Mummy!
Mum! It wasn't me.
The others
they were talking about.
I had nothing to do with that.
Fuck off.
Mum, it vvasnae me!
Mum!
["Born to Cryâ€œ

Well. I know someday
it may be soon
That master will cal!
And when he does
I tell you something
I won't cry at all
Until it happens. folks
I guess
H! sail with the tide
And I know--
[soundtrack stops abruptly]
[old woman singing]
[humming distractedly]
[Barney]: Mrs. Gaffney!
Is it?
Have you been here
since the party?
[giggles]
Come on, I'll take you back.
I'll just go
to the toilet first, son.
Ho. no. no. no!
Whoa. vvhoa, vvhoa, no--
I-I I'll see you.
I think your paFs

What do you want?
"Mature vvolnan looking for
unbridled passion?"
Do you mind saying that
again in English. sir?
I can't LIFICIGFSIQHC]
a word you're saying.
Yeah, I realize you're Scottish.
I know I'm up here.
Why are you here?
Thomson told us
Henderson had
a gambling problem.
And he was in a lot of debt.
How, I've just spoken
to $I:-: bookies
from the local area,
and not one of them has said
that Henderson bothered him.
80. that means
Thomson's lying. right'?
He's turning shitting himself
into an an form.
Yeah, well. I'd shit myself
if every time I turned round,
I saw your fucking
big oookney face
staring back at me.
Just-- forget Barney Thomson!
This is not
a barber-based crime!
And give me the phone.
Get out there and check on
the Inissing persons
like I ordered you to!
Give me my phone back.
I need it.
You've got your own phone.
I need two.
[seething angrily]
[muttering in rage]
$il-!
We've just had
a report in
another Inissing person.
Fuck 'em.
Sir, it's one of
the other barbers.
From that same barbershop
That guy called Porter.
Well.
Have you mentioned this
to Strap-One-On Robertson?
I was just about
to tell her, sir.
Good.
Right, son.
Let's go and interview
the demon barber of Bridgeton.
The next train to depart
from the rear of Platform 5
will be the 17:12
first rail service to Girvan
calling at BarrheacL Dun!op_.
Stewarton. Ai/maurs. Ai/marnock.
Troon. Prestwick
International Airport...
Ho. Ho sign.
Well, he's probably
up in Arbroath.
Posting Porter's balls
to his auntie.
Let's check out Porter's flat.
Come on.
[gasping]
Right.
Right.
I had no idea, officer.
I'm absolutely stunned.
Mind you.
The dark side of Chris
was never too far away.
He was alvvaya um.
Flip-p-ing his razor out.
Rubbing his self up and down
against the back
of the barber's chair.
You know, that kind of...
that kind of thing.
You know, if you ask me.
I think his childhood
had a part in all of this.
You know that his mother
Ll$ed to, uh.
Look him in the bunker,
throw in a boiled egg
now and again.
Get him out.
Dress him up
in one of her nighties.
And get him to dance
for his Uncle Gerald.
P] ow...
does that sound normal to you?
Ah.
I have no idea
where he could be.
I mean.
there was a friend in LGWISHQITI,
but. uh, why would he go there'?
Right. The freezer.
What the fuck?
You're that copper
off the telly!
You're Taggart.
You're off The Bill?
You're a loser.
Oi. Taggart!
Has there been a murder?
My ma thinks
you're shite, Taggart.
Fuck off!
He killed them
then he put them in the bin.
He put them in the bin.
because...
he was...
awfully tidy.
Ah, fuck.
Fucking little sweaty socks.
He fuokin' boiled them.
He out them up
and he fuokin' boiled them.
[knock on door]
[knock on door]
[knocking continues]
[pounding]
You don't think we should
check with Robertson
about a warrant, sir?
Radio reception
round here is shocking.
[Man]: What are you
doing in there,
ya dirty wee bastard?
What?
Yer at it, aren't ye?
With one of
yer dirty vvee lassies.
Where is she?
Ya dirty,
dirty wee bastard.

[Iâ€œ-~leighbol.lr]:
Ya dirty. dirty wee bastard.
Are ya doin' it right now?
Show me, show me.
Do ye want to watch?
'Cause we're doin' it
right now.
Come, come closer and see.
Oh, aye?
[MaoPhersolw]: Sir?
The fuck?
What is that?
Oh, I think we've hit the jackpot here.
That's handy.
[neighbour muttering]
[Fleighbour]:
You dirty, dirty bastard.
Fuck you, Robertson.
[Robertson]: I will have
your arse for disobeying orders!
We couldn't reach you.
We thought maybe
you'd gone deep oover.
In a boys' school's shower.
Don't you fucking start--
[MacPherson]: Look!
There's a piece of each victims,
some represented
more than others.
There's also a receipt
for a train ticket--
Glasgow to London.
Filed a report yet?
Hey? Hey?
Well, I'll take it from here.
As of now, off you fuck.
[James]: Flee VVullie.
How nae Chris.
[Barney]: Well, Chris likes
a Friday night.
Probably lying
in his own piss somewhere.
[James]: It's the middle
of the week.
[entry bell jingle-s]
Barney Thomson?
We need to contact him
very urgently.
So. you know,
if you could...
He rubbed his self
up against the back
of the barber chair.
Oh...
And he had a cousin
in LQWiShQITL
in London.
So, what was your
last contact with him?
[dogs barking]
[Barney stamlnerilwg]
Just normal, you know.
He left.
Uh...
I tidied up.
And everything was just...
perfectly norm al.
Yeah. Okay.
That's fine, Mr. Thomson.
So if you could, uh.
Send in
Mr. Henderson, please.
Okay.
[dogs barking excitedly]
Hey. Hey~
Shoo. Shoo!
Shoo, shoo. shoo!
Go! Well, don't.
Just, fuck off!
Fuck off, dog!
Don't-- Get fucked.
Just beat it.
FLlcki n'...
[dogs barking]
Well--
So, that's that, then.
My Maddie's deid.
[dogs barking outside]
I'm afraid so. Mr. Henderson.
If you'd like to accompany us
to the station,
we can fill you in
on the details that we have
up to this point.
Blah. you're all right.
I've got a couple of regulars
coming in an hour.
Life must go on, eh?
[dog barking]
[Cemolirwa]: Bye. girls!
See you's at the bingo!
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
[laugifi]
I know
what you've fucking done!
[Cemolirwa]:
Less of the language.
Know what?
I've been in your flat.
What the hell were you doing
in my flat'?
There's been another accident.
Oh, God.
Who is it this time?
- Chris.
Chris? Chris who?
The other fucking barber!
Ooh, well done.
I've been in your free:er.
You're that body parts killer.
I know.
What have you got in there?
Your pals.
Get in the fucking oar.
What the hell
are you playing at?
Eh?
Have you been
driving around with--
You oannae keep them in the oar!
Are you Inental?
Look, I wanted to plant
them in Chris's flat
and make it look like
he was the killer,
but he's got a wee freezer.
What?
His free:er's too wee!
I-lis freeze-Es too fucki n' wee!
Would you just
listen to yourself?
I never saw
the fuokin' point of you.
Chris Porter, last seen
by Barney Thomson
on Monday evening
when he left
Henderson's barbershop
His girlfriend
reported him missing
the following afternoon.
Under my instruction.
DI Holdall and D8 hflaePhereolw
were sent on a routine cheek
to the individuaFs flat,
where they found
several body parts,
which I believe
to be connected
to the serial killer's
victims.
We're just waiting
on pathology
for confirmation.
We also discovered a receipt
for a train ticket to London
the previous day.
[Molvlanamalw]:
Anything to add, 1Z7?
[Holdall]:
It's too clean. sir.
It's like the evidence
was laid on for us.
How, there are follow-ups
I'd like to instigate
before we go public.
Barney Thomson?
You're obsessed.
I talked to the man
yesterday.
You know where he was
when Henderson went missing'?
The bingo.
Does that sound like
a crazed serial killer to you'?
[knock on door]
[Molvlanamalw]: Ah, Jenkins.
I've just completed
the pathology report, sir.
You have the floor.
It couldn't have been Porter
who chopped up those bodies.
It's normal for there to be
skin cells present
on anything we touch,
but with the vigorous
ohop-ohop-ohopping.
Those would have been enhanced.
These skin cells determine
the age of the assailant.
I'd state in a court of law
that this was done by someone
in their late 60s. early 70s.
Well, I'll be fucked.
So Porter's got an aooolnplioe.
Exactly so. 119.
And it isn't Thomson. 127.
[Robertson]: Right,
you will now interview
every old lag in Glasgow.
Every last one.
You go near Thomson again,
I'll put you on traffic.
Get cut there
and find Porter's accomplice.
[Barney]: Why did you do it?
[Cemolirwa]: I don't know.
You do it once.
You sort of
get the bug for it.
I can't ex-zplain.
it's like...
you know you shouldn't.
And that's part of
the kick, you know?
Going on dates.
You never knew what
you were going to get.
[Barney]: Fuokin' hell.
Well, what do you
want me to say?
"Sorry?"
It's noe as if I'm entirely
without compassion.
I sent the relatives something
to remember them by.
What, an arse?
Get off my back.
Did you kill Dad?
Oh...
[Barney]: You told me
he fucked off to Australia.
I kept asking you why.
And you oouldnae give me
a straight answer.
You oouldnae
because you fucking killed him.
Shite.
I never told you
because I knew you oouldnae
handle the truth.
So, what's the truth?
He moved to Harthill
and opened a tobaooonists.
HarthilFs only
five fucking miles away!
See?
I knew you'd be like this.
Well, vvhy didn't he
keep in touch?
[Cemolirwa]: Maybe he was just
like everybody else.
Maybe he couldn't be fucking
bothered with you either.
Know why?
'Cause he wasn't your dad.
What do you mean
he wasnae my dad'?
Him.
That wee prick.
He vvasnae your dad.
What's the matter
with you'?
Well, who-who was my dad?
"Who was my dad?"
Who's my dad?
- I don't bloody know.
-Hovv no?
'BI-low r10?"
-l-low fucking I10'?
[Cemolilwa]: I was a very busy
lady back then!
I didn't know
any of the punters' names!
I didn't want to know!
Pu nters?
As long as they paid up front,
I didn't care.
I just pointed them
round the back,
that way you don't have to look
at their fucking ugly faces.
I had the Women's Realm
spread out
on the chest of drawers.
I'd be flicking
through that all day.
That's what got you through.
Vermin. the lot of them.
Don't you
look at me like that.
You do anything to get by.
Your granny, she had a place
above the butcher shop
on London Road.
It's one of the nail salons now.
- Granny Beattie?
-Aye.
Think what she had to do
to keep you in fucking
Dolly Mixture.
- Avv, Christ...
-What? That's life.
Is it fuck!
Oh, you would know,
would you?
You, what, all the living
you've been doing.
Look at you.
Fucks sake.
I thought
I'd been careful.
And one day, of course.
the inevitable happens,
and here we are.
Total fucking disaster.
I kept meaning to tell you.
You kept fucking
meaning to tell me, did you?
You kept meaning to tell m e?
This is shite!
Absolute fucking shite!
You don't give a fuck
about anything, dae you?
It's all a fucking
laugh to you.
This is myfuoking life here!
This is shite.
This is fuokin' shite.
Get up.
Get up.
Will ya get up!
Look at you,
a big bubbly bairn!
You make me sick.
Be a man for once. will ya!

See he's out of the shops. then.
[Holdall]: You watch yourself,

-Deid.
My Dodie.
Oh. Dodie died.

in the greater Glasgow area.
He had an aooolnplioe.
Somebody a bit... older.
You think my Dodie
had something to do with this'?
- Well...
-Fu0k off.
[chuckles]
Dodie never did a favour
for anybody in his life.
The only murdering he did
was for himself and the family.
[sighs sadly]
He'd do anything for his family.
[Barney in memory] You've got
to look out for your Mum. eh?
She'd do anything for me.
Anything at all.
[MacPherson]: Listen. sir.
are you sure about this'?
[Holdall]: Look, the pathologist
didn't say the gender,
just the age.
He kills them,
she takes the body parts
on her coach trips.
[MacPherson]: Pitlochry.
Fraserburgh. Montrose. Arbroath.
[Holdall]: All the prize bingo.
And Fuok-Me-Quiok places
these old biddies flock to.
How, that's where
she posts them from.
You know, giving
the perfect alibi
to her beloved son.
Tell you what,
let's pump this old bag
full of biscuits
and make her fucking squeal.

They left behind her dreams

And the different
kind of love
She thought shed found
Was nothing more than sawdust
and some glitter...
God bless.
Thanks for coming.
God bless, darling.
Thanks for coming.
I hear they found Wullie
all chopped up.
[Barney]: What?
Are you coming

tae mess about
with the fucking
likes of you.
I'm run off my feet at work
with the two of them dead.
So why don't you

"Two of them dead"?
I thought

Shite.
I didnae do it, Charlie.
[Charlie]: I thought
it was just Wullie.
[Barney]: It was Chris.
The police
are looking for Chris.
It said on the radio.
[Charlie]: Well, that's fine.
[Barney]: It was nothing to do
with me. do you hear me'?
I cliclnae kill 'x/Vullie.
I cliclnae kill Chris.
And don't you go telling
the fucking police

Okay, Barney, okay.

They'll never catch him.
Hot a chance.

[Holdall]: Here we go.
Tell me the mother's

[MaoPhersolw]: CGITIOHHQ.
[Holdall]: That's the most
ridiculous name I've ever heard.
[MaoPhersolw]: She'd been running

Loheoked

Several replies.
So that's how the fucker

And six'; other men
from the Glasgow area.
Well, it's a wee bit
more oolnplioated than that.
Is this where you dumped
the body of Chris Porter?
[Barney]: Well. I...
What did you
come back here for?
The phone call.
[Robertson]: The phone call?
[Holdall]: We phoned him.
[Robertson]: Holdall.
Great, you're just in time
to watch me make the arrest.
The fuck are you doing here?
[Holdall]: I could ask you
the same question.
[Robertson]: We were tipped off
by Thomson's pal,
Charlie Taylor.
Great wee [val you've got
there. by the way.
Fucker.
[Robertson]: Just kept tabs
on him. and here we are.
You know, it just
confirmed my belief
that Thomson
was our man all along.
[Holdall]: Yeah, bollocks.
I solved this case.
Where the fuck were you?
Playing with your fanny?
[Robertson]:
It was a double bluff.
I just wanted to let Thomson
off the hook
so he'd make a mistake.
relax-z a wee bit,
you know, fuck up?
'Course you came along
and nearly screwed
the whole thing up.
DI Fuokwit and DS Debbie McGee.
The only reason he's here
is 'cause we tricked him
into checking on the body.
L-ley. I'll remember you
when they promote me
to Chief Superintendent.
[Jobson]: Maybe we'll let
you and your monkey
do the security
at some third division
football matches.
[Holdall chuckles wryly]
Be my guest.
[Jobson]:
What do you want. monkey?
Fucks sake.
Whoa!
Guns. Well. I'm impressed.
MM you' Mao? hereon"?
Oh, absolutely, sir.
Arrest this pair of bastards.
Oh, fuck...

Oh, not without
my authorization.
Excuse me. can I just--
[all cooking guns]
Okay.
Mew-
What form did you sign?
Uh, blue D 14.
I-la! You should have used
the new [sink D 13!
Well, nobody said anything
to me about a pink D 13.
Oh, well. you obviously
didn't see the red C 24.
Red?
Add "incorrect form filling"
to the list of charges.
This is fucking ridiculous.
We're all supposed to be
on the same side here.
All right, give us the guns,
and I'll forget about
the assault charge.
Yeah'? Well. what about
the arrest report'?
Did you mention Barney Thomson
to anybody else?
Ho. I just signed the guns out
for personal protection.
Same here.
Didn't want Molvlanalnarw
telling you our plan.
All right, we'll forget
about the arrest report.
You just be thankful
you're not going
to fucking jail!
Thankful? I gave you
the fucking suspect, you tosser!
Do you know what?
I've fucking changed my m ind.
You're so fucking

And they were accidents.
And that's when
I went to my mum.

in the paper.
Then she shagged them
