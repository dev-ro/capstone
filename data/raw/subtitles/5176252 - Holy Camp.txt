CANTEEN
What are you doing?
You scared me!
What time is it?
I don't know.
What is it?
Sus...
It's half past!
10:30 already?
No, it's 11:30!
-What are you doing?
-Bullshit.
I swear.
No, no, no!
What about the alarm?
What's going on?
Maria? Maria!
-You didn't set the alarm?
-No.
Are you serious?
I was exhausted from
the fucking gymkhana...
Would you two shut up?
My phone.
I can't find my cell phone.
-Call me.
-Okay.
Can you please explain?
This is like my grandmother's
sister's farm?
Shut up or I'll smack you!
Take it outside.
-Okay, okay.
-Fucking great.
Six missed calls from Joseba.
Joseba!
Joseba! Fuck!
They're not there!
What are you doing?
-Nothing.
-Are you okay?
I'm freaking out.
Let's go, we're late.
-Damn, nice dress!
-Yeah, it's a Bershka.
-I love it.
-Where's the vodka?
Under the pillow.
Will you two shut up already?
Relax, I'm leaving.
Joseba?
Please, first time I dream
I'm somewhere else
and you wake me up.
Shut up bitch!
I want to go home so fucking badly!
Joseba, has it started yet?
Go outside, I can't hear you!
What?
No, you listen! I'll kick your ass!
-Sus, be quiet!
-Joseba!
-Be quiet!
-I'll send you a WhatsApp!
What do we do? What do we do?
A taxi. I'll pay.
-A taxi?
-Yeah.
In the middle of the fucking forest?
Where do I order it? That's ridiculous.
Google "Tele-taxi Segovia."
-See what comes up.
-I don't have data!
I ran out on the fifth.
-Me neither, Susi.
-Let's see.
Wait, my mom gave me
a number, I'll try it.
What are you doing?
Marta, please get out.
Bathrooms are for peeing,
not for other stuff.
Hello!
Hi, good evening. How's it going?
I want to order a taxi.
Where?
Camp Compass.
What street?
What do I say, the forest?
Sir, do you know where
Camp Compass is?
-In Alto de Leon.
-It's in Alto de Leon.
No, no, in El Espinar.
There's a field of oak trees
around the camp.
I'm saying whatever
comes to mind.
Tell him it's a famous camp
run by nuns, not New York!
It's a famous, well-known
camp run by nuns.
With a yellow logo.
-Yes!
-Yes?
-Yes!
-Thanks, Marta!
-That's it.
-Really! The Third World...
One thing.
Can you come quickly?
We're going to a concert.
It's super important.
Henry Mendez.
No, Electro Latino, like Juan Magan.
Okay.
Great, that's it then.
Thank you very much.
Big kiss.
I could kiss you, sir!
Maria, Maria. Wait, wait.
-Did you score any?
-No, you?
Hold this.
Hey.
Don't tell Joseba, he'll mooch off me.
Good evening, Segovia!
Are you ready to party?
A rock in my tongue.
You're my queen,
and that's why I scream
for the world to hear:
I need you.
A toast.
I love you.
Well?
Finally!
So handsome!
-You liked it?
-I loved it!
How are you?
Good, you?
-Good.
-Hello handsome.
-Hey.
-What?
Did you score any?
No, you're such a nag.
-I'm such a nag?
-Yeah.
I had a surprise for you,
but now I won't tell you.
Where, here or the bathroom?
Here, here!
But be discreet.
Here's the thing.
I met Henry's producer.
-So?
-I told him about you two.
Give me a kiss.
-Give me a kiss.
-Let's hear it already.
He wants to meet you.
-Seriously?
-Yeah.
Seriously?
-Maria.
-What?
Henry's producer wants to meet us!
-What?
-He wants to meet us!
-Okay. Okay!
-Let's go.
Let's go. I love you!
Come on!
Let's go!
HOLY CAMP!
CAMP COMPASS
I think you don't know...
Come on, girls. Get on the bus.
Put on some lotion
or you'll get a sunburn.
I'll be right there.
-Some lotion...
-No.
Yes!
-Let go, let go of your purse.
-I never let my purse go.
Okay.
Single line, girls! No pushing!
Sandwiches for everyone!
Here, Mariluz.
Give me a hand. My helper, up you go.
Fatima Nuñez.
Almudena, Celia
and Yolanda Martinez Pijo,
all three of you.
-Good morning, Sister.
-Good morning.
I'm Mother Bernarda,
the new coordinator.
I'm Sister Jesusa.
Kiss, kiss.
-How are we doing?
-We're missing two.
Just as I thought.
Right. Milagros!
-Come here.
-Yes?
Coming!
Chusa, Mariluz!
Should I wait?
Your attention, please.
We're looking for Sister Paquita.
She needs her insulin.
We can't find her anywhere.
We're desperate. Sor Paquita please...
Mind the step.
Let's go!
Get up!
Good morning!
Hurry up!
Today, not tomorrow.
Let's go.
Good morning.
Very nice.
You two look gorgeous.
Very original nightgowns.
You set a record.
My first day here
and I'm already sick of you.
Give them a round of applause,
they deserve it.
Go on, clap.
That's it.
This is for you.
There.
Who are you?
I'm Mother Bernarda de Los Arcos.
I'm here to replace
poor Mother Magdalena,
who after the incident
in yesterday's gymkhana,
will not be returning.
Wow.
They're laughing.
It's hilarious!
-I'm laughing too.
-Sorry, sorry...
Watch. Watch me laugh.
No, I've heard.
You two think this place is a party.
That it's useless and you're cool.
But as long as I'm here,
I'm the cool one here.
Good morning, Mother.
I'm Sister Maricielo.
Well, Sister Chelo.
The bus driver.
And Sister Loli and Sister Gladys.
-Good morning.
-Good morning, sisters.
What's up?
The bus is parked in the sun.
There's like a greenhouse effect.
The girls are roasting
and starting to rebel.
So option A:
We leave right now, but right now, now.
Option B: I evacuate the bus.
It's your call.
-You know what the problem is?
-No.
We're being held back
by these two jokers
who won't integrate
and prefer to do their own thing.
-Do you know them?
-Yes, very well.
Hi.
That's them.
Hi.
-Troublemakers.
-This morning, right?
-Yes. Always.
-Here's what we'll do:
While you enjoy a beautiful day
of kayaking and reflection at the river,
these two young ladies will be
grounded the whole weekend.
-What?
-Locked in here.
-No, no, no way...
-Yes, yes, yes.
Sister Milagros will stand guard
and you'll do
-as I say.
-Damn.
You said it.
I'm sorry, Milagros.
No kayaking for you.
That's okay, mother.
Kayaking isn't really my thing...
She doesn't like it.
It's a bit annoying.
That's right, it's annoying.
We'll have a great time in the water.
-A great time.
-Anyway, Sister Chelo.
Enjoy yourselves.
I'm staying with the girls.
-Okay.
-Kisses. -See you later.
-Kisses.
Take lots of photos and have fun.
Don't worry, they'll leave it spotless!
Who's that woman?
-Susana Romero.
-Who the hell is she?
Susana Romero!
Well?
Well, what?
She doesn't remember.
It was 7 in the morning.
Your friend was drunk.
Drunk as a skunk,
acting like a fool.
Stumbled into the nuns' cabin
asking for money for a taxi.
-Excuse me?
-Excuse me?
Yeah.
I've had it, I'm serious.
Clean all of this up
before Bernarda gets back.
Maria! Start cleaning up!
You sweep and you make the beds!
Why do I have to sweep?
Because I just told you to.
So let's go, the party's over.
WE SHALL LIVE FIRMLY IN THE FAITH
Okay, listen up! Girls, please, sit down!
We'll get stopped by the police!
I said sit down!
I'll be angry for at least a week.
Just so you know.
-Don't laugh, I'm serious.
-I'm not laughing.
It's just that last night was so worth it.
-Really.
-Sure.
-You want to hear why?
-No.
Hey!
-I'm not in the mood.
-Ask me why.
-Not now.
-Come on, let me tell you.
-Ask me why!
-You're such a pain. Why?
Because look.
Last night I met a guy who's a producer.
A producer!
And what does the producer produce?
Music, my friend!
Hey.
Sister.
Sister. Sorry.
Sister Milagros.
I give you an inch and you take a mile.
I told him Maria and I have a group
and he was totally interested.
Because he said girl bands
are the new fad.
Who has a group? You and Maria?
-You have a group?
-I didn't tell you?
No.
"Suma Latina."
"Su" from Susana,
"Ma" from Maria, "Suma"...
My idea...
"Suma Latina."
And we have a single called
"Let's do it and see."
You sing?
-So you're a singer now?
-We both sing.
And...
-What kind of music?
-Electro Latino.
-Like fusion merengue?
-No.
Electro Latino is...
Do you know Juan Magan?
No.
You don't know who Juan Magan is?
Right now I don't...
No.
Daddy Yankee? Kiko Rivera?
-Doesn't ring...
-Henry?
This is Henry.
No.
-Nope, I don't know him.
-Henry Mendez.
Never mind.
We do the same thing as them,
the same, but more hard core. More upbeat.
Okay, you'll have to play it for me.
Okay.
Susana.
What?
Can I tell you a secret?
Yeah.
I had a band too, you know.
-You sing?
-No.
Well, I sang... I used to sing...
many years ago,
you can't imagine...
But we weren't like that gentleman.
We sang versions of...
music from back then, stuff like...
Mecano.
Mecano?
How old do you think I am?
I don't know.
Stuff like Presuntos.
Presuntos?
Presuntos Implicados.
No idea.
What about Soledad Giménez?
No.
"Cómo hemos cambiado."
-Oh, the song.
-Sure.
Oh, damn!
-Yeah, yeah! Sing it.
-No.
-Sing it.
-No.
-Sing it.
-I said no,
-Susana.
-Why?
I haven't sung in years.
You're the one
who should sing for me.
Sing... Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I hurt you?
-Watch it!
-Hey, I'm still mad at you.
Well, now.
Can I ask you a question?
Yes. Anything you want darling.
How old are you?
You shouldn't ask that.
Come on, tell me.
I'm... 28 years old.
28?
Almost 30.
Seriously?
-I look older.
-No.
You look younger.
Thanks a lot!
-How do you do it?
-I drink a lot of water.
That's true.
But I don't take any serums.
Maria, did you hear that?
She says I look 24 years old.
Very funny.
-I was being serious.
-Yeah, right.
I'm exhausted.
Anyway, tell me.
Did you have fun last night?
It was awesome.
I had an okay time.
What a grouch.
Don't call me a grouch.
-Damn it.
-Okay.
You know why I'm mad?
I don't see why I have
to get punished
because you came back drunk
and made a scene.
What, what, what?
You didn't go out, Maria?
Of course she did.
But her new thing is she just takes off
at who knows what time or how
and totally leaves me hanging.
You left me hanging.
I have to do what you say?
I can't come back whenever I want?
What the fuck?
Do whatever you want always.
I came here to be with you!
And I'll tell you something.
Thanks to me, we got invited
to the producer's party. Okay?
And thanks to me not being a grouch,
we might have a chance.
So zip it.
Please, no more parties.
You're either clueless
or a whore, I don't know.
What did you say?
The truth, Susana.
Remember why we started
the group?
Because there was nothing
else to do in this shitty town.
And now you think we're
the next Andy and Lucas?
We're not little kids anymore.
Joseba can't play
and you and I can't sing.
Look, call me clueless,
a whore, whatever you want.
But I've always been the same. Always.
You're the one who's changed. So you can fill me in any fucking time!
-Did you just kick me?
-Yes, I did.
Leave me alone!
Hey, stop!
-Susana Romero!
-Leave me alone!
Maria Casado!
What about you?
Nice attitude, Romero!
Maria, don't!
Don't do that!
I don't like friends fighting.
A friend...
A friend is the greatest gift.
Never forget that.
Damn it, but it's okay
to change, isn't it?
Well, changing... It depends, right?
Sometimes
it's better to stay
how you were. Definitely.
But why?
Because sometimes
new things can be worse.
Yeah, but they can also
be better.
I...
I'm going to take this to the kitchen.
Milagros.
What?
One question.
The black woman who sang,
what was her name?
Sister Carmela from Uganda.
She sang...
No, the one who died.
-Sister Carmela died?
-What?
No, Milagros.
A singer
-who died...
-You mean an artist.
Yeah.
Sorry.
A black artist who...
You mean the one who died recently.
-Yeah, that one.
-She was black.
We say colored.
-She made movies too.
-Never mind.
I know who you mean.
What was her name again?
Milagros, it doesn't matter!
Damn it!
I'll think about it, okay?
Thanks.
I can't stop thinking
that this might be
just the calling.
I'm so curious and lonely.
I was always the best
at dancing reggaeton all night.
What the hell do I do now?
If this is faith,
take me,
take me or run away.
I'm so scared
and I don't know what to do.
If you've come for me,
just give me a sign
or at least wait
and let me get dolled up.
I know there's something
inside me
that gives me a rush
and this madness
makes me want to be yours alone.
I know that I'm changing,
something's happening to me
and I'm holding back,
but I only want you close to me.
If this is faith,
take me,
take me or run away.
You're wasting your time
if you think
that I know what I should do. But what am I saying?
Who am I talking to?
I don't want any of this.
I must be hallucinating.
I feel it so deep inside of me.
What the hell do I do now?
Get out of here!
I don't want to go on.
I'm going to wake up
and you'll be...
gone...
Who are you?
I am the light of the world.
Whoever follows me
will never walk in darkness,
but will have the light of life.
Whoever drinks the water I give them
will never go thirsty.
I'm the bread of life.
Whoever comes to me
will never go hungry
for my flesh is food
and my blood is drink.
Don't be afraid, Maria.
For you have found grace
before me.
"We shall live firmly in the faith.
In your hands there is
nothing to fear."
Wait, wait...
"For Jesus we sing..."
Watch out...
"...always for Him.
We shall live firmly in the faith."
Very bad, I'm sorry.
-I was so so.
-No, very bad.
It's not hard, focus. Again.
Okay.
"We shall live firmly..." And then
you just follow the line like this.
-All the way down.
-Mother, mother.
What?
-Sorry to interrupt...
-That's okay.
Well...
What?
I don't know why we're
doing this right now.
Milagros.
Why do the girls sneak away
from the camp? Why?
Why?
Well, they've reached an age...
-Because they're bored.
-They're bored.
Why was I picked to come here?
Well...
-Because you're modern.
-That's right.
Because I'm modern,
the show I put on for the Pope
in Barcelona, that was epic.
Music, Milagros!
What did I always tell you in Alcudia?
-In Alcudia?
-Yeah.
"Music makes miracles, Milagros."
That's right.
I'll straighten out those girls
by singing to the Lord.
Come on, let's get back to work.
Right.
Left.
In the middle, all the way down.
Right. Watch out...
Sorry.
The show for the Pope was in '84.
So?
Well, maybe girls nowadays
like other things.
-Mother.
-What?
Do you know this year's summer hit?
No, Milagros, I don't.
Juan Mangrain. Do you know him?
Juan Mangarin?
Haven't had the pleasure.
That makes two of us.
That's what, that's...
That's what I'm trying to say.
How can we teach those girls?
Look at us.
-What?
-No.
I mean...
The girls are growing up,
don't you see? When I was their age,
I was already a novice.
So I don't know what
it's like to be that age.
I might not know how....
Look, Mother, just to clear things up...
I know, I know... that Maria Casado is not well.
I've tried to talk to her,
I said, "Maria, let's talk."
I reached out to her to see
if she would...
Maybe I'm just feeling
a little useless.
And are you okay, Milagros?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Maybe a little sad.
But that goes away, Mother.
Don't worry.
What did we say in Alcudia
when we were sad?
What do we say when we're sad?
I'm happy.
Why are you happy?
I'm happy.
Bernarda, Bernarda...
Tell me why.
I'm happy.
Why are you happy?
That's what I'd like...
to know.
I'm happy.
Why are you happy?
I'm happy.
Tell me why.
I'm happy.
Why are you happy?
That's what I'd like to know.
I'm going to tell you.
You can tell me.
The reason you're so happy. Hallelujah, because
Jesus called me one day.
He stole my heart
the same way.
And that's why I'm so happy.
Give it all, Mother!
My turn!
Go, Milagros!
Believers are so happy,
believers are so happy.
Believers who praise the Lord
are so happy.
Free step!
Believers are so happy,
believers are so happy.
Believers who praise the Lord
are so happy.
Sadness is gone,
pain is gone too.
For the believers
who praise the Lord.
Sadness goes away,
pain goes away too.
For the believers
who praise the Lord.
Sometimes the sky looks gray,
the clouds won't go away.
Then Jesus opens
my eyes wide.
He says, "Girl, at least
you didn't get crucified."
Amen!
-Amen!
-That's right!
Sadness goes away,
pain goes away too.
For the believers...
who praise the Lord.
-Oh, Milagros.
-Oh, Mother.
Oh, Milagros.
I think I hurt my spleen.
-Help me down.
-Oh, Mother. You're a sassy one!
You're too old for this stuff.
Your time will come too.
Wow.
You see? Music makes miracles.
You could be right, Mother.
You could be right.
Back to "Firmly in the Faith."
Hi.
Sweetie!
-You look awful.
-I feel like shit.
-Give me some ibuprofen.
-Okay.
Eat some yogurt
so it won't burn your stomach.
-What are you making?
-Lentils.
I'm so hung-over.
Hung-over, she says.
-I thought you'd get expelled.
-Okay, okay.
I don't even remember.
And you know why?
That ecstasy you gave me
was too good.
Yeah, it's top quality.
You just don't know how to use it.
-Damn.
-You have to take one,
wait until it takes effect,
go to the next galaxy,
come back, take a little more,
go back up and come back.
You have to know how to use it.
By the way, you haven't paid me.
Some dealer you are! Here.
Here.
I'll give you the rest later.
-I'm writing it down.
-Okay.
So where did you go last night?
To Fashion. There was a concert.
Nobody goes there anymore.
Too many young boys.
Where do you go?
Did you know they're giving salsa classes at the old hostel?
-I want to sign up.
-Sign up with your boyfriend.
What boyfriend? I'm all alone.
Didn't you have one?
Yeah, but he moved on.
He lives in Alicante now.
Want to sign up with me?
I don't know.
How about a cigarette?
Take one, but I'm writing it down.
-You write everything down.
-You never buy your own.
-You didn't help me.
-I'm exhausted.
Tell me if it's modern, or too long,
or needs a little more swing...
What are you doing here?
-Making lentils, with Janice.
-Lentils?
Go clean up.
And take a shower, you stink!
Who are you?
Janice, Mother. The cook.
Oh, nice to meet you.
Do you like music?
I love it.
I have a song to show you,
Milagros isn't helping...
Look, Mother. Sorry.
The girls have a music group.
"Suma Latina."
Maria!
Sorry I scared you.
Look, I know you like
other music, other styles,
other singers... Juan Marigran,
right? But that's not my thing.
I brought a song with me
that I'd like to show you.
-Yeah, but...
-It's short.
It's like a flash mob,
with 10 nuns and 30 girls.
It's real fast, you'll see.
...always moving forward.
We shall live firmly in the faith.
In your hands there is
nothing to fear.
For Jesus we sing,
always for Him.
We shall live firmly in the faith.
Again.
We shall live firmly in the faith.
Jesus.
In your hands there is
nothing to fear.
The light!
For Jesus we sing,
always for Him.
We shall live firmly in the faith.
That's it. That's it.
What did you think?
It brought you to tears.
I knew it.
I knew it.
Don't ask me why, but I knew
I had to bring this song
to the camp.
"Firmly in the Faith" will be a hit.
-Bernarda.
-What is it, child?
What?
I can see God.
-You?
-Yes.
Come here.
Come here.
Give me a hug! Here.
I knew it.
-You did?
-Yes.
I knew it when I saw your face.
-That I see God?
-That you were confused.
And that you would find the way.
Not this fast,
but that song never fails.
No, Bernarda. I see God.
-I really see him.
-Of course.
What do you mean?
Because God is here.
Here.
He's here?
Here, sure as the air
you breathe.
-Can you see Him?
-In every corner.
Is He here right now?
He's here.
And here.
And there, with you, with me.
Here, now and always.
No! Did you understand
a word I said?
Maria, I'm a nun.
I know my God stuff.
Okay, I'll try to explain.
Fine, take your time.
-Go ahead.
-I'm in bed, right?
-With four little angels.
-No, no.
No.
I'm in bed and a man appears.
A real man. He's dressed in black
and he sings to me.
Sure.
Sure.
A man dressed in black
who sings to you.
Right.
You're making fun of me,
aren't you?
No.
Are you making fun of me?
You're recording this, right?
"Let's make a YouTube of the
new nun and make fun of her."
No, I'm telling the truth,
I swear.
I don't think so.
Not liking the song is one thing.
Maybe you find it
old-fashioned...
It's happened before.
Hardly ever!
It might need some thought.
But you won't make fun of me,
or the Lord, our God.
He's watching us right now.
You and me!
So get out. Go and clean
the bathrooms!
All the flowers
that cast a spell on love
and awaken my hopes
say that you will come.
I'm going to wait for you,
my soul filled with resolve,
and the taste of dreams
that I made come true.
If this is the way
that I planned with you,
don't look back,
we have to keep going.
I've gotten lost so many times...
In your eyes
I found myself again.
I've fallen so many times...
With your help
I got back up again.
You appear
like a growing new moon
and what I thought was asleep
suddenly wakes up again.
I'm going to write you
a song with open arms
about hearts filled with hope
so that I can sing.
If this is our fate,
I'm glad to see you.
Let's start over
the story again.
I've gotten lost so many times...
In your eyes
I found myself again.
I've fallen so many times...
With your help
I got back up again.
I've gotten lost so many times...
In your eyes
I found myself again. I've fallen so many times...
With your help
I got back up again.
With your help
I got back up again.
With your help
I got back up again.
With your help
I got back up again.
With your help
I got back up again.
-Susana Romero!
-Sorry, sorry...
What were you doing here?
I was looking for Maria.
In here?
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you were here.
Susana...
I just got here, I swear.
You scared me. -I wasn't expecting anyone.
-I know.
I was looking for some things
and I didn't hear you come in.
I'll go...
I have lots of things to do.
Excuse me.
Milagros.
What?
I'm sorry about this morning.
Okay.
No, wait. Another thing.
Well...
I want to apologize...
Seriously because...
Damn it, I know I cause
a lot of trouble and I know I put you
in a spot with the new nun,
but...
I feel bad.
Sometimes I'm too strict
with you two.
I can't help it.
I wanted to apologize too.
I'll go.
I'm allergic to the dust in here
and I have things to do.
See you later.

I AM THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD

Look, Bernarda.
Believe it or not,
I've been seeing a man appear.
A man dressed in black who sings songs
that really affect me.
Today he spoke to me for the first time
and he said he's the light
of the world.
And since I started seeing him,
I'm not the same.
It's like when...
Like when you fall madly in love
with a boy.
You see him and you're scared...
and you're embarrassed
and you don't know what to do.
But deep down,
all you want is to be with him.
Suddenly that's all you care about.
Nothing else.
You don't believe me,
but I'm seeing a man
and I'm convinced that he's God.
I'm convinced, I know it,
I can feel it inside.
And I thought I was telling the right
person, but I don't know you at all.
What does he sing?
Songs by that black woman who died.
Whitney Houston?
The black singer who died.
Whitney Houston.
-What?
-Whitney Houston?
Yeah!
-What?
-Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, that's it!
He sings Whitney Houston?
Yes.
What's wrong?
What's wrong, Mother?
I love Whitney Houston!
I know all her songs in English.
I'm her number one fan.
I don't understand a single word.
There's nothing to understand, child.
That's the voice of God!
Yeah.
-What do I have to do?
-Pray.
Pray.
That's really not my thing.
You don't know how to pray?
Okay, come with me.
You're with the best.
The camp chapel.
You've never been here?
To pray, the three I's are
the most important thing .
They are: inspection...
Inspection.
Inflection, your knees.
-Get on your knees.
-Inflection.
-Interaction.
-Interaction.
Come on. Again.
Inspection...
-Lower your shoulders.
-Yes.
Good.
Inflection...
Tighten your buttocks.
Interaction. Stick your chest out.
Page 177.
That's it, good.
Eat my pussy.
No, no...
Oh, Janice. What a long day.
Have you got any ibuprofen around?
No, sweetie.
Susana took the last one the other day.
I've only got ketamine
and a little speed.
But that's different.
No, besides, only ibuprofen
works on me.
Janice.
Can I tell you a secret?
The girls are sneaking out tonight.
Not again.
I'm letting them go out and party
because it's for work,
otherwise, you know I would't...
They have a meeting
with a big time music producer.
-National level.
-That's great.
Let's not get our hopes up
because the music world
is what it is.
That world...
You have to work long hours
and work hard,
people are jealous...
I can imagine.
I'm telling you from
experience, because I...
At another level, but I know it.
Yeah? No.
You?
Tell me about it.
-I was on the inside.
-No, Milagros.
When?
A long time ago.
Tell me, tell me.
On a more local level
maybe, but...
The industry is the same.
Wow!
But I don't know...
I just want the girls to do well
and prove themselves.
They're very good.
I'm going to pray for them.
I'll light a candle
and pray for them.
-Milagros.
-What?
Pray for me too.
Why? What happened?
Nothing.
But I need a man.
What about your boyfriend?
He moved to Alicante.
I didn't know.
You want a man?
I want a man.
How do you want him?
Well...
A man who'll dance
close to me all night.
I'll pray for one.
-Good night, Janice.
-See you tomorrow, sweetie.
Shit.
What are you doing?
Nothing, peeing.
Where have you been?
Around. How about you?
Around too.
You're going
to the party now, right?
No, I'm not going.
Why not?
Because we're not little girls
anymore
and we're making fools
of ourselves. -Okay?
-Sus...
I don't want you to miss
this opportunity because of me.
Since when is this opportunity
only mine?
I don't get it, since when?
Do you want to go?
If you do, we'll go, but this...
This was our thing.
Maria, do you want to go?
Good evening!
-What's with the suitcase?
-I'm leaving.
Where?
Susana Romero!
What, what, what?
If you're running away,
you have to tell me.
I'm not, I'm going to sleep
in another cabin. What about the party
with the big producer?
-You're not going?
-No.
You're not going either?
I hope you're not breaking up
the band behind my back.
I don't know, ask her,
see what she says.
You're both acting super weird!
Hey, hey, hey.
What?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
You?
Nothing's wrong with me.
-Maybe you want to talk...
-No. Bye.
-Come here.
-What?
Don't go to bed without this,
darling.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Lock the door.
-God.
-Come here.
Come here.
What are you doing out here?
I'm going to make this camp work.
Now? At midnight? Why?
What's going on? I'll tell you tomorrow.
But I'll give you a scoop.
A bombshell!
-What a day, Milagros!
-You're telling me.
Go on, go to bed.
He'll catch you awake.
Who's going to catch me?
Santa Claus, who do you think?
Go on, go to bed.
-I don't understand, Mother.
-You will. You will.
Susana.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Can I come in?
-You already did.
That's true.
What's up?
Well...
You have to go
to the producer's party.
Listen to me.
Any chance you get
in the record business...
I'm not going. Listen to me.
-No, listen...
-No, you listen.
-You can't let this get away...
-Milagros, listen to me!
I'm not a little girl anymore.
But listen...
I'm serious, I'm growing up
and I can feel it.
I don't feel like
being drunk and on ecstasy
all the time.
No, and... so... it's Friday
and I'm here in my pajamas,
but please.
Look at me, here I am,
growing up.
Well, I just think that...
if you don't go, you'll regret it
for a long time.
Very much.
No.
-Any mosquito repellent?
-No.
Here, there's a plague
of tiger mosquitoes.
-They make me sick.
-I know, but they'll eat you alive.
Oh, my God.
What a day.
Did you get it in your mouth?
What a pretty tattoo. What does it mean?
"To learn."
How nice. You have to learn
a lot of things in life.
Every day something new.
-You're acting weird too.
-Yeah.
-Okay.
-Okay.
Okay, I'm going to bed.
Tomorrow's another day,
God willing.
HOLY BIBLE
What about you?
Inflection,
interaction...
"My soul proclaims
the Lord's greatness.
My spirit rejoices in God,
my savior.
For he has looked upon
his slave's loneliness.
From now on will all ages
call me blessed
for the Lord has done
great things for me."
-"My soul proclaims the Lord's greatness!"
-Proclaim, proclaim.
Maria.
Maria.
Maria.
Susana! Bernarda!
-Hurry!
-I'm coming!
She's not breathing!
Bernarda!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Bernarda!
-She's not breathing!
-Maria, are you okay?
Are you okay?
Give her some air.
-What happened?
-You scared me!
She wasn't breathing,
she was lying here...
-You got scared.
-She wasn't moving...
-I'm okay!
-Are you sure?
She likes to sleep on the ground
like a hippie, that's all.
-How did our thing go?
-What thing?
What's going on?
-She wasn't moving...
-It's okay.
-"Maria, Maria..."
-What?
She was just lying there...
Milagros...
Milagros!
She was with God.
She's been blessed,
that's what's going on.
Maria...
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Tell me what He said.
-Mother!
-"What He said?"
-Who are we talking about?
-Hold on.
-Who?
-Mother, I said so.
Something is wrong with her.
How could I not have seen it?
Milagros, shut up!
Just be quiet for a second.
Go ahead, child.
Speak.
Say something! Sorry.
Yes, yes, yes!
I can see God.
There. Thank you, Mother,
for your discretion.
-Thanks a lot.
-Maria, wait.
The Lord, our God?
Who else? And?
He appeared again
and I tried to focus, I swear.
I got on my knees and prayed.
Good!
Good.
And?
And he laughed in my face.
What do you mean?
He laughed and took off.
It doesn't happen overnight.
It can take time to reach Him.
I can sense that He expects
something from me.
And I don't know what to do.
How stupid of me to think
God was in love with me!
-What?
-Really!
-I'm stupid, that's all.
-No, you have to keep trying.
-Maria...
-Susana, please.
Let me talk to my friend,
please!
Maria, this is bigger
than Fatima.
This is bigger than Lourdes!
Just leave me alone!
Okay.
Okay, but we have to call
the Vatican!
We have to call the Vatican!
Shut up!
Just leave me alone! Please!
Wait.
Let's see.
-Susana Romero.
-Maria.
Leave the cabin.
-Listen to me.
-Susana Romero,
leave the cabin.
-This is my cabin!
-Leave the cabin
right now.
Ma'am! Ma'am!
Unbelievable!
Don't call me Ma'am!
Sister Bernarda, you terrorist!
Milagros.
-Maria.
-Get out.
I'm coming!
Come on.
-Mother...
-What, what?
We have to call the Vatican.
-Go ahead, call.
-Really? Do I have the authority?
Go on!
Go find the area code!
Maria.
Maria, we're alone now.
Maria.
Hello. Vatican?
Yes, look.
I'm calling on behalf
of Mother Bernarda de Los Arcos.
I need to talk to the Pope,
it's urgent.
Pope?
Listen to me for a second, um...
Look, God is present
here right now in Spain.
Listen...
Hello?
Ma'am?
When we can't find the speed,
our legs get stuck.
When you stop talking,
that's when I start listening.
When you haven't had a chance
and your glasses fog up.
-Why didn't you go?
-I didn't feel like it!
Can't you see I'm blowing you off?
Don't you get it?
Don't touch me!
Fuck you!
Kiss my ass!
I dream about being
above it all,
underneath your skirt.
With the night full of light
and your soothing voice.
And your soothing voice.
Today I heard the calling
louder than ever before.
With the lights out
and ,my legs open.
When we pass electricity
from your finger to my back.
When you're exhausted
nobody's scared of the dark.
When we're not afraid
of what is to come
and we lower our guard.
When you shake for no reason,
that's when you learn to walk.
I dream about being
above it all,
underneath your skirt.
With the night full of light
and your soothing voice.
And your soothing voice.
Today I heard the calling
louder than ever before.
With the lights out
and my legs open.
Milagros!
There.
Hi, Milagros.
Carlos, you made it.
This place is deserted.
Everyone's in Ledesma.
What about you?
I stayed.
You stayed behind? Why?
Personal reasons.
It was your turn.
Installing the zip-line...
Here we go.
Installing the zip-line...
You're installing it already?
Yeah. Sister Paquita called me,
she's injured.
Yeah, again.
What happened?
-Kayaking.
-What?
She tipped over and they found her
2 miles down river.
She said to set it up,
she's coming tomorrow.
She's got a thing
for the zip-line, huh?
You get hooked on these things.
-She said tomorrow?
-Yeah.
Yeah, tomorrow.
It's tight but I can do it.
What about you?
Alone here, like a queen.
-Peace and quiet.
-Yeah, plenty of that.
Very relaxed.
Sure. But that's over now.
Carlos is here to turn this camp
upside down.
Oh, God.
I'm going to install it...
from here...
-to across the river...
-Oh, the river.
Across the river,
over that shed...
over those trees
all the way over there.
The girls will... zoom!
Like arrows!
Hi.
Can I come in?
I brought you a little snack.
-Look what I brought you.
-I don't want any, thanks.
How was your night?
Bad.
He didn't come?
No.
Maria.
Seeing you like this breaks my heart.
I mean it.
It just isn't worth it.
It isn't.
Why do you say that?
You think He'll come back?
Well...
How should I know?
What I mean is,
I was thinking
and I think it's better
if He doesn't.
Why do you say that?
Because I see you...
Look, you know what
the problem is?
When someone is young,
like you,
you experience life in general
very intensely, you know?
And sometimes it isn't.
Listen to me for a second.
Sometimes all you really want
is to clear up your doubts
and just get rid of them.
But later on, after a while,
you look back and...
think maybe you were wrong.
Milagros, it's not that.
Really.
He chose me.
And I wanted to be with Him,
that's all.
You know what?
Even if you think so,
you still don't know what
you want, believe me.
I know what I want, Milagros.
Really, I do.
Okay.
But do you know
what He wants from you?
No.
Do you know what happens next?
It's not easy, take it from me.
The only thing
I wanted to tell you
is I think it's better to leave
things as they are. Stop.
Stop, stop, stop.
Use your head
-because later...
-What, what, what?
Your friend Susana always
appears out of nowhere.
What were you telling her?
-Me?
-Yeah.
Well...
Well, I was giving her
my opinion.
What might be best for her.
How can you know what's best for her?
How?
Do you know who you're talking to?
We don't think.
-Or stop, or use our heads or quit trying.
-Oh, my God.
Milagros, have you ever been in love?
Susana...
No, I'm serious, have you?
You're so madly in love
that you can't stop thinking
-about that person?
-Susana Romero!
No, right?
-No, right?
-That's enough.
Well, I have.
And I can't stop thinking about you.
And if someone told me
I'm confused and I have to stop
and use my fucking head
I'd tell them to fuck off.
Because yes,
against all the odds, I, Susana Romero, am a dyke,
I'm in love with a nun
and my best friend is in love
with God. To each their own.
Maria.
It's just that...
I won't let anyone
discourage my best friend
or discourage me. Understood?
Understood.
Remember the name
of our single?
"Let's do it and see."
Not "I won't do it just in case"
or "I'll do it just a little."
No, no, no, no.
We do it...
We try, and if it doesn't work out,
we move on,
but at least we tried.
Right?
You know what I would do now?
I'd go over there and kiss you,
but I won't.
Fuck it, yes I will.
Susana...
Milagros, what's wrong?
You think she went overboard,
is that it?
-That she went too far.
-Maria...
I'm sorry, but I don't.
I'm not like that.
I'm brave.
I've always been brave.
And we're "Suma Latina."
I'm so glad I came to camp
this summer, Milagros. -Me too.
-Now please get out.
Damn!
-Unbelievable!
-Yeah.
-Really unbelievable.
-Yeah, yeah.
You're the one who's into God!
Hey!
Come here.
What a pair.
Are you going to tell me
what's going on now?
Please, just tell me.
Say something. What's wrong?
God stopped coming to see you?
Is that it?
Yeah.
So what happened?
What did you do?
I prayed, that's all.
That's good, right?
-He's God.
-Yeah.
How did you pray?
You want to hear it?
Sure.
Look, I said:
"My soul proclaims
the Lord's greatness.
My spirit rejoices in God,
my savior.
For He has looked upon
his slave's loneliness."
It's horrible!
Unbelievable.
Look, I don't know. Really.
Who taught you that?
Bernarda.
She said to get on my knees
and say that. And I did.
You should have seen Him.
He laughed his head off.
Yeah.
Yeah, but He comes...
you pray to Him,
and He laughs in your face?
Yeah.
I don't get it.
When you see Him,
what does He do? What's He like?
He sings to me.
-He sings to you?
-Yeah.
-Church music? Hallelujahs?
-No.
Songs by Whitney Houston.
I swear.
Seriously?
You're saying that God comes
to sing you Whitney Houston
and you go and pray to Him?
Remember that whole drama
we went through
when Tiago blew you off?
Remember how upset you were? Okay.
How did you get him to notice you?
-Maria.
-What?
Did you pray to him?
-No.
-No.
No.
Did you get on your knees?
Well, you did after.
Susana, please!
No she didn't, she didn't.
So, what did you do? -I know.
-What did we do?
Well?
What did we do?
No.
That?
Hail Mary full of grace.
Conceived without sin.
How is she?
She's better than I expected,
Mother.
Has He come?
Carlos, he's installing
the zip-line...
The Lord, has He come
to see Maria?
No.
He hasn't come yet, Mother.
Our father, who art in Heaven...
Bernarda.
What?
I'm leaving.
Look, I tried...
and it didn't work out.
I want to see if I like doing
something else in life.
What are you saying, Milagros?
What's happening at this camp?
Mother,
I can't...
It's not the camp, Mother.
Is...
that kiss...
Who, the Lord?
No, not the Lord.
The zip-line guy?
-Carlos?
-Yeah.
No, no...
If he kisses me...
Then who?
Who?
Susana Romero.
Susana Romero?
Susana Romero?
What are you talking about?
-Susana Romero...
-Yeah, the terrorist.
Susana Romero here?
Here?
Not with her tongue...
Shut up!
I've only been here three days
and there is that much that I can take.
My goodness.
Susana Romero kissed you.
God laughs in the other
one's face...
You're leaving, tomorrow
25 girls are coming back
and I'm on my own...
You know what, Mother?
Don't worry at all about the girls.
You'll love them
as soon as you meet them.
My girls...
They're such good girls.
They'll miss you a lot.
Me too.
Me too.
Milagros! Milagros. He's here.
-He's here.
-Who?
-He's here?
-Yes, he is.
Where is He? Where is He?
Outside!
-Where is He?
-Look, over there.
Who is that?
That's Carlos, the zip-line guy.
You're kidding, Janice!
Why?
My man finally came.
He loves dancing and he signed up
for salsa lessons with me.
Janice!
Come on, I'm nervous.
I want to warm up.
I'm coming!
Anyway...
-Milagros.
-What?
Thanks.
Why?
You prayed that I would
find a man.
There he is.
Have fun.
I sure will.
See you tomorrow.
Good night, Mother.
-Good night.
-Good night, Milagros.
Good night.
Tomorrow everyone
on the zip-line!
No way!
-You promised!
-I wish I hadn't.
Look at her.
Janice and Carlos. What a couple.
Music performs miracles, Mother.
That's right.
Music makes miracles, Milagros.
It's true.
Milagros, I just realized.
Milagros, music...
Do we start or wait for Him?
-We wait for Him.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
-Okay.
-Where are we looking?
-There.
Does he come now?
It depends on the day or what?
-Yeah, about now.
-Okay.
What if He doesn't come?
-Maria.
-What?
He'll come. Do you believe?
-I believe.
-Then He'll come.
Careful...
Will I be able to see Him?
Or will you be talking to nothing
like you're crazy? Is there a light?
Stop, you're making me
even more nervous.
All right, I'm sorry. What do we do?
We start. Turn on the music.
Okay.
Maria Casado!
Forgive my advice.
I love Whitney Houston...
Harry Potter costumes?
Sorry...
Sit there and wish us luck. Please.
-There?
-Yes.
Okay...
-Let's go.
-Romero!
Susana Romero!
You look beautiful, Milagros.
Thanks.
So do you.
Come on.
Let's go.
Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing... Suma Latina!
Move your hips,
the race is starting.
Today nothing can go wrong.
Suma Latina. I told you!
Watch how I move the wind with my hair,
today we've come to dance.
Daddy...
I'm going crazy.
Just by...
touching your lips.
-He's not coming.
-Believe.
Let's do it and see
you can say that
it's only a game.
I'm dying to give it my all.
-He is not coming.
-To give it all.
My bed has
four corners,
four hunks standing guard.
I close my eyes
and scream your name.
If you dance the night away.
Holy shit!
What?
You, you, you...
You set the beat.
Holy shit! I can't believe it!
I give into the rhythm
of the night.
I'll get in your car
if you want.
Let's do it and see
you can say that
it's only a game.
I'm dying to give it all.
Fuck it.
Come on.
Damn, girl.
-I love you!
-Thank you!
Susana and Maria!
Are you seeing this?
Susana!
Stop! Stop!
Susana!
What a scene you're making!
-He looks serious.
-Yes! Yes!
What?
-Maria. Maria, sing.
-Shh!
He went like this. Sing.
Maria...
Maria.
Go on.
Maria.
I love you, okay?
I love you, I love you,
I love you...
Maria.
