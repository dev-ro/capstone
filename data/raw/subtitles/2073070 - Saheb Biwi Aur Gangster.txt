Greetings! Saheb...
aren't they your men?
Do you suspect anyone?
I shouldn't say this...
but it's the second time this month.
This can't go on.
I know, your the only one left.
We'll make our move
when the time is right.
Saheb, Jaiswal had called.
He wants something done.
What should I say?
Nothing.
The time isn't right.
Can't find the words
to narrate this tale
Yet a tale so true
how can it be kept away
Round and round goes the maze
Spells and witchcraft abound
Everything here is upside down
Heaven help, oh the terrible sins
Swindlers trapped by
their own wicked djinns
Spells and witchcraft abound
Everything here is upside down
Heaven help, oh the terrible sins

Hello Minister sir.
All okay, Gainda Singh?
Thanks to your grace.
- Come...
I will gladly bear a
million enemies...
but I can't take an insult.
Kanhaiya...
you said Jaiswal had called...
ask him to come over.
Saheb, there are
two mines in my area.
One belongs to me...
while Khetar Pal owns the other.
But... I have a friend, Shyam Bohra.
He wants to set up a mine.
And he is loaded.
If he gets into mining...
I will be wiped out.
Are you asking me to...
If he gets killed...
I'll be the prime suspect.
But why? What about the guy
who owns the other mine...
Khetar Pal?
It's also possible he
could've carried out the deed.
When two people are
suspected of a crime...
the toss of a coin is
enough to weed out the culprit.
Does anyone know that you are here?
Gainda Singh?
- Of course not, Saheb.
Meet Gainda Singh...
and ask for his help.
Once that's done, tell your friend...
that his life is in danger.
Inform the cops too.
- Sir, how do you know that...
he could be attacked?
Well you see... due to my business,
I meet a lot of people.
I heard that
something is about to happen.
All you have to do
is provide security.
I advised him not to
get into this business.
Did I not tell you? Tell.
Now, when Gainda Singh's
goon goes to kill your friend...
which you will know...
the cops will arrest him.
And you will no longer be a suspect.
After a few days have passed...
I'II...
kill your friend.
By the way...
don't refer to the person
you want dead as your friend.
Now there's nothing to fear.
I never feared anything, Jaiswal.
Just relax.
- To hell with relax!
I will show Khetar Pal
what I'm capable of!
You will do no such thing.
Just let it go!
- Let go of what?
You don't have a chauffeur...
how will you drive back?
I'll drive the car myself.
- Of course, you are James Bond!
Excuse me, please...
side...
Come.
Wave goodbye to the room.
Bye!
Come on... Let's go.
- Yes.
This place is quite far from home.
Fine, next week I'll rent
a room somewhere else...
Oh shut up!
Get out!
Hey! Let him go!
What has he done? Let him go!
Have you lost it, Babloo?
Let him go!
I'll beat the shit out of him...
and check what he
has that I don't have!
Why don't you ask me? I'll
tell you what you don't have!
What? - You don't have class.
You are a brute!
You called me a brute?
I even learnt... English for you.
The things I've done to please you.
Like what?
I... I learnt to play
the guitar for you...
Guitar?
When you hold the guitar it's like...
a monkey wearing a tuxedo!
Now let him go!
Greetings Saheb...
Greetings Jaiswal...
breakfast?
Actually it's time for lunch.
The English are responsible
for ruining my family's habits.
How so?
- It's their clock on the wall...
and over in England
it must morning now.
Of course. It must be.
Let me go! I need to talk to Saheb.
Where is he... let me go!
I...
I...
need to speak with you.
Why don't you take a
walk and come back later?
We'll speak then.
Who is this? You
haven't introduced us.
He is... Mr. Jaiswal, from Lucknow.
Oh!
How do you do, madam?
- Very well.
What brings you here?
Thought I'd pay Saheb a visit.
I see...
so, you're from Lucknow?
- Yes, madam.
Lucknow is a beautiful city.
- It really is beautiful.
How many kids do you have?
I have two little kids.
- Really?
What does your wife do?
- Um... she's a fashion designer.
I'm sure she makes
some amazing designs.
Yes and I'll get something
for you, next time I visit.
Oh, thank you. What
are your kids' names?
Well... one is Sonu and the
other Monu. - How wonderful!
Ma'am, the car is waiting.
- I'm having a conversation...
leave my hand.
Tell me something about yourself.
- Ma'am, the car...
I said, I am having a conversation.
So tell me...
why don't you get your wife
along some day? - Of course.
We'll have a great time. Come on,
it's time for your sight seeing.
Let's go.
Do you have all the bills?
And the cheque book?
- That too.
Good. You seem to
have become organized.
Sunder... take Madam for
a ride around Devgadh.
Do look after her... she
hasn't been keeping well.
You are my health, Saheb.
You look after yourself.
Hello...
Greetings sir...
Where is he... your Casanova?
Babloo, just go away.
Greetings sir.
So it's you!
You think you're a hero?
Why did you bet the hell out of him?
He's in a coma now.
If his coma ends in a full stop...
your strength and energy...
will be spent baking bread in jail.
That's why he was here.
I hope the police case is sorted.
I gave an entrance
exam for a bank this year.
If you could...
Hey! Everyone out!
Move to the side,
I need to have a meeting.
Listen to me,
this isn't some social service.
Yes sir.
What will you do for me?
Once the bank hires me...
you can apply for any
amount of loan hat you want...
and I will get it cleared.
That's a good joke.
Now get out of the way. Move it...
Sir... I'm sorry. Sorry sir...
Just say the word...
and it'll be done!
I swear.
Your uncle works for the
King of Devgadh, right?
Yes, as a chauffeur.
Okay.
Are you blind, you idiot?
Where's my wounded soldier?
Greetings, Saheb.
- Hello.
Now, you are tied to this
bed for a good month or two.
I'll rest for a few days.
I must say... Kanhaiya,
don't you think Madam...
demonstrated a good presence of mind.
Now even she will have
to stay within the palace.
Oh no, Saheb.
I've asked my nephew
in Lucknow to come here.
He is good at driving.
He is someone you can trust.
Kanhaiya will figure
if he is trustworthy.
As for the driving...
Madam will judge that.
I will avenge whoever
has done this to you.
Very soon.
Excuse me...
Whom are you looking for?
Sundarji?
Who are you?
He is my uncle.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- What?!
Oh... what?
Bloody English!
Your uncle brought you up but
did you ever inquire about him...
how he is, his health...
whether he is even alive... did you?
That's precisely why I am here.
- What's that supposed to mean?
He lost his job yesterday.
Now if his living quarters are
taken away, where will he go?
Tell me!
Please do me a favor
and take me to his room.
Follow me.
What? Struck by lightning, are you?
You think...
only girls in the city know English?
Even I know English.
Come on.
Sundarji...
here is your good-for-nothing nephew.
Oh yes...
- Uncle, what happened to you?
Babloo, you are here!
Do you eat meat? Baa
- baa-Ioo...
I look after Sundarji's food.
It's chicken curry today.
But, if you are one of those
leafy vegetarian types, tell me...
I'll call for something
to be delivered for you.
And make it quick, I don't have time.
Will you at least
let him say something?
I haven't censored his speech.
He can say anything he wants to!
He will have it. He likes chicken.
Just because you like it, I
hope you won't demand it everyday!
Baa-ba-Ioo... See you.
Suman's tongue is
like a Formula 1 car!
But she is very sweet.
I still can't imagine that
she is Kanhaiya's daughter.
Kanhaiya?
- Saheb's man shadow.
Once upon...
a time there were many.
But one by one they all vanished.
Somehow I am still around.
But who is behind it?
Saheb is well respected in this area.
So why would anyone
have a problem with that?
Who told you that
anyone has a problem?
Never mind, I don't want
anything to do with it.
Tell me more, It's
an interesting story.
Things work differently over here.
Saheb has respect and
status but he is broke.
What about daily expenses?
The Queen.
Saheb's step mother.
The King bequeathed
everything to her.
Greetings...
your Highness.
When will you say,
'greetings mother'?
I'm here to ask...
for the land deed to the red mansion.
So that you can sell it off?
What's left to sell?
Everything belongs to you.
But you want me to come...
before you... and beg.
So here... I'm begging.
I want respect, my dear.
Respect.
Respect.
Your father knew how
to accord respect.
He took a courtesan for his
wife and gave her respect.
What have you done?
Your first wife took her own life...
while the second one
has lost her mind.
Please! Tell me what have you
thought about the red mansion?
For now, take this.
After all...
I can't send his son
back empty handed.
Greetings.
Listen!
What?
What? What is it?
Stop seeking pleasure outside...
pay attention to the one you have.
It won't be nice...
if you repeat the mistake...
your father did.
What is Shikaar Baadi?
Shikaar Baadi is a place.
The one who lives in... is something.
The night, it taunts me
The night, it taunts me
With all its stars as bright can be
There's no one as Ionely as me
The taunts burn me up whole
If you stay, I'll surrender my soul
The night, it taunts me
Tell me what
Tell me what you want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
It's time to grasp
the mischievous night
It's time to grasp the playful words
It loves to leave me
hanging by a thread
Let's do something
that this night never ends
The night, it taunts me
With all its stars as bright can be
There's no one as Ionely as me
Tell me what
Tell me what you want to hear
Tell me what I want to hear
Tell me what
Time you learnt the truth about love
Time you caught the
laughter in my breath
The night brings out my true desire
Let's do something that
sets our hearts on fire
The night, it taunts me
With all its stars as bright can be
There's no one as Ionely as me
Tell the night its
pride I don't want to see
Tomorrow it should bow down before me
The night, it taunts me
The night, it taunts me
Saheb...
Saheb...
Yes?
It's morning...
time to wake up.
You can tell the morning...
that Saheb has ordered it to go away.
Nature doesn't bend according
to your whims, the way I do.
Mahua, one day you shall see...
that nature has bent to my whims.
And when will you fulfill my request?
Last week...
I had asked for 20,000 rupees.
I shall send it.
If I have your permission...
I'll get it done myself.
Don't forget what you are!
I will have...
Kanhaiya bring it.
That would be nice.
Take care, Saheb.
Enough.
Saheb...
Be careful.
I hope you've understood.
- Yes, of course.
What I mean is how to address whom.
I understood it all.
It was more like a Chemistry
exam than a briefing of the palace.
Sundarji, your nephew is a coward.
He won't survive in here.
Listen!
- Tell me, Baa-baa-Ioo.
Is everyone crazy around here.
You will go crazy too.
Driving Madam around...
is like balancing on
the edge of a sword.
But don't you worry...
I've put in a good word for you.
Alright... thank you.
And just because I'm nice
to you and talk to you...
don't assume that I
am flirting with you.
Hope you got that...
Babloo!
Babloo!
I want a good rifle...
something like a 315.
This is what you should have.
It's a double barrel.
It's the finest English make.
This is used for prey that's nearby.
My foes are hiding at a distance.
These days, it's hard to come by...
a brave enemy who
strikes from up close.
What did you say your name is?
- Umm... Ghosh...
Not you! You...
what's your name?
- Babloo.
Babloo.
I want you to stay true to your name.
Have you told him about Madam?
Yes.
Okay. This is...
Saheb... you see...
this is... I mean...
it's for 250,000 rupees. - How much...
It's expensive.
- Do the bullets cost?
250 rupees each.
I feel the bullets should cost more.
The bullet is
responsible for the kill.
What do you say, Babloo?
Yes.
You get 100 free with the rifle.
Madam often falls ill.
You will need to drive her around.
Saheb, you won't have...
a reason to complain.
You won't find me complaining.
I've already warned you.
If you do make a mistake...
it will cost a mere 250
rupees to attain martyrdom.
Introduce him to Madam.
Thank you, Saheb.
Fine, I am keeping this.
- Okay.
You will be paid later.
Oh please... don't embarrass me.
Saheb...
- Yes?
I haven't received the
previous payment yet.
I would be grateful,
if I could get that.
Suman?
- Yes, father?
Take him along...
and introduce him to Madam.
Yes.
Sorry...
sorry...
sorry...
Inform Madam that
the new driver is here.
Don't look up at Madam.
Why don't I pull out my
eyes and give them to you.
Keep them with you.
All the best...
Baa-baa-Ioo.
Sit.
Vegetarian or non-vegetarian?
Well, it depends.
What?
Well... whatever is
available I have it.
What is it?
Sit.
Rukma!
That means you cannot be trusted.
What?
You just said...
that you are opportunistic.
For once, you could place
your trust in me and try.
Once. I'll trust you...
but just once.
Eat.
Don't know how to use it?
Well... the Lord has
blessed me with hands.
No.
Not with your hand.
Anything you do, do it with class.
Uncivilized behavior is
accepted as long as it's classy.
Hmm...
Sundar told me your name is Babloo.
Really, that's your name?
It's my nickname.
What's your real name?
It's Lalit.
Get out... get lost.
Get out of here. Throw him out.
I'll shoot him...
throw him out!
- What... what happened?
Was it something I said?
What did I do?
She asked for my name...
and I replied.
Next thing I know, she
flung the plate at me.
I think she is crazy.
You think it's funny?
This is your 'welcome
to the mansion' bandage.
With a name like Babloo...
you are sure to get hit.
I said my name is Lalit.
You should've told the real one.
This is my real name.
Fine!
Tell me...
did the plate flung at
you fill your appetite...
or you want to have a real lunch?
I'm not hungry. Get lost!
Now what?
- Get lost.
Get lost.
Fine.
Everybody's crazy! Everybody!
It's you who are crazy, you idiot!
I made a mistake by calling you here.
You rascal! I've been
working here for 25 years.
Not once has anyone reprimanded me.
Who switched the light on?
Who is it?
I asked who is it?
What?
What is it?
Get out of here. Get out...
Get lost...
So Babloo... tell me.
Sir...
things are weird over here.
Everybody's crazy.
I don't think we need to kill them,
They're already as good as dead.
Babloo my dear...
even a dead elephant
is worth quite a lot.
The day Saheb dies...
now that will be a red letter day!
A day to remember.
We should send
Sundar's nephew back, Saheb.
Why... what for?
Madam didn't take to his name.
Babloo?
It's Lalit.
She flew into a rage
when she heard it.
Had I heard, even I
would've been enraged.
It's alright.
It's not the poor guy's fault.
You don't get it, Babloo.
These so called Kings...
come preloaded with whores
for as long as they live!
Well, at least the
bastard doesn't have a child.
What's that screaming sound?
A bloody pig!
Pig!
They have a long
life and they are loud!
Your Saheb will continue to
make noise even after he's gone.
Keep an eye on him.
As you say, sir.
What's for dinner?
Sir, a rooster!
Well you should try
a hen for a change!
Hey! Babloo!
You're still asleep? Time to wake up!
Why?
- I need to measure your neck.
My neck?
- Yes.
You're to be hung at the gallows.
Hung?
- Yes.
Who told you?
- My dad.
He's called for you.
If you ask me, his mood suggests...
that he'll chop your head off!
But I argued...
that you should be hanged.
It won't hurt that bad... okay?
But what have I done?
Everybody's crazy!
And don't you dare call
me crazy in his presence.
He dotes on me.
And he has 15 cases of
manslaughter against him.
Sit.
I'm fine, sir.
Sit!
Why are you here?
- Sorry?
What's your intention of coming here?
I thought I'd drive in
place of uncle for a few days.
As the chauffeur.
Well then you better stop
doing the night watch, get it?
Sir...
it's a new place so...
couldn't sleep...
Pick a card.
Any card.
Take a good look.
All of us...
are slaves to Saheb.
Remember that.
Place the card back.
If something untoward happens...
you will disappear
just like this card...
and you won't even feel a thing.
Yes, sir.
I might not come at night.
Okay.
First day working for Madam.
So?
It could very well be the last.
What do you mean?
You wanted to see me?
I'm going to the temple.
Place your hand on the offering.
I suggest you take Chhotu
and Mangal along with you.
I have a weapon.
And I know how to use it.
I didn't get contract for
the jungle road this time.
So I need to go to the
city for a few days.
Can I get you something?
You could try
bringing my nights back.
The nights were always yours.
But you offered them
to someone else...
remember?
Go away. Please just go away.
Rukma...
get the new chauffeur.
Rukma!
Rukma... wait here.
When your prayers are answered...
it is customary to offer
a sacrifice over here.
What did you ask for?
Why should I tell you?
If I ask you for something...
can you give it?
I will give... anything you ask for.
Can you give up your life?
I can also take one!
It's easy to take a life.
You can ask Saheb...
or Kanhaiya.
But to give it up...
I'd gladly give it up.
For you.
Then go ahead.
You said...
you'd do it for me.
The pistol betrayed me, Madam.
If you wish...
I'll leap from here.
I'll tell you...
when needed.
First day working for Madam.
So?
It could very well be the last.
What do you mean?
If Madam asks for your
life as a sacrifice...
don't be afraid.
That's how she tests...
for loyalty.
I'm not worried about the elections.
It's a little bit of my money...
and the party gives the rest.
But for my daughter's wedding,
all of it will be mine.
I can't afford any risk.
It's a three bedroom
apartment in Delhi, Saheb.
Lower your hands...
I said lower them.
So for a contract worth 80 million...
all I get is 15 million?
I still have to build the road.
A road through the jungle?
People in the city don't
have roads to walk on...
and you want to
build a road for animals!
Don't teach me politics,
Gainda Singh.
Yes? - Sir, Mr. Aditya
Pratap Singh is here to see you.
Saheb is here from Devgadh.
Please... please ask him to wait.
Sir, I did...
Minister...
there was a time when you'd hear
the car and run out to greet me.
Is something wrong with your ears
now or is there a change of heart?
Your highness, surely
you don't mean that.
I was trying to get some
matters out of the way.
Thought we could have a
long uninterrupted chat.
I'm not here for a long chat.
I want to give you a
piece of my mind...
It won't take long. I'm coming in.
He is coming in!
I'm not afraid of him.
Don't be stupid!
I think both of you
should hide in the bathroom.
I don't want to go to the bathroom,
Why should I...
he doesn't scare me!
I will revoke your contract.
Will you stop quarrelling?
- But why go to the bathroom?
Now!
Let us go to the kitchen,
why should I go to the bathroom?
Come with me!
It's very comfortable.
It's not comfortable.
Prabhu Tiwari...
I think I may need
to change your name.
You think you are the Lord?
Saheb, the servants are around.
He knows everything.
He writes all my speeches.
Saheb, I beg of you.
Please, sir.
Kanhaiya, the minister is begging.
Take it easy.
You promised... you told me that...
I would get the contract this time.
I was on a tour in Thailand.
Bangkok.
Sir, there has been some
deal at the clerical level.
Anyway, the contract for the
Lakhimpur Bridge is still open.
It's a railroad bridge. - Who is
this Kapoor who got the contract?
I heard Gainda
Singh is responsible.
Kapoor? I have no idea, Saheb.
And Gainda Singh
doesn't have the contacts
to get things done at the ministry.
Yes... put him on.
Saheb...
it's the chief minister.
I have to take this.
Convey my regards.
Jai Hind, sir.
Just say the word, sir.
The tour was good... in fact, great!
No, sir, nothing much.
No, sir... but...
sorry, sir...
everything is allowed in Thailand.
Don't seem like a crime over there.
There is no feeling of
cheating at all, sir.
I... I...
I... I... will... meet you at home.
Saheb...
Saheb!
- I need to use the bathroom.
Who... who said that, sir?
Sir... sir, I
will handle the media.
I'll feed them some other
interesting story, sir.
I told you!
I will manage the situation, sir.
The Thailand fiasco will
definitely die down...
but I saw the
highlights in the bathroom.
Bathroom? What did you see in there?
- We were merely standing.
Gainda Singh...
I know you aspire to be a Nawab.
But I suggest you don't
continue with your interests.
But it does have a ring to it...
'Arsehole Gainda! '
Watch what you say, Aditya Singhji.
I feel your royalty has
left you high and dry.
Your vocabulary has a
strange streetwise ring to it.
In the past kings would
fight with other kings.
It would be a fair and open fight.
But when street crawlers
feel they stand a chance...
it's only right to come
down to their standard.
The ones you think
as street crawlers...
will soon be dancing on you head!
Enjoying dance performances
has been a family tradition.
And it's people like you who
have danced for our pleasure.
Why don't you check with
the elders in your family.
I am sure quite a few
still know the steps.
You better...
- Sir... what are you...
this is my office, sir.
My father shot your grandfather
from this long a distance.
He had encroached on our
property and built a house.
You won't be able to shoot me.
You see the situation has changed.
You are a king merely
because of the title...
similarly, this pistol
is merely called one.
It belongs to a museum...
and so do you, get lost!
I came here to meet you,
Prabhu Tiwari...
fortunately I got to
meet your family too.
Kapoor!
You got the contract, didn't you?
You won't be able
to build the road.
Instead I'll have a
road named after you.
Minister...
the elections are around the corner.
Let's see who will
emerge as the winner.
I think...
we should share this
contract with Saheb.
Of course, Kapoor.
If I could, I would share
pieces of your body with everyone!
If we agree to a compromise,
my reputation won't be
where I want it to be.
That's not what I meant.
- Stop practicing the alphabet!
It's better you practice my methods!
Gainda Singh...
whatever you do... do it smartly.
There are examinations
to test intelligence...
you don't need it
to avenge something.
What's this stone for?
That's Saheb.
He remains next to my bed.
It makes me happy.
My heart is thirsting
Figure out what my heart is saying
Or soon a new tune it will sing
If you don't, others will spring
You better figure this
My heart is thirsting
What can I do It bared
its soul just like a fool
I won't survive a moment without you
You are my life, it's true
What's wrong with you!
This I want you to know
What took place
between us happens no more
What we have is our love to keep
It's only your love that I ever need
What?
How dare he touch me?
- No, I... no...
How did he come in here?
Throw him out!
How dare he touch me?
Take him away... I'll shoot him.
Throw him out... I'll shoot him.
I did nothing, I swear... I was...
- How dare he touch me?
How dare he touch me?
I didn't even touch you!
You better go away or I'll shoot you!
I... I... was only singing a song...
I didn't do anything...
You better get away!
I hope she will be fine.
I am sorry.
Let me go, Mahua.
Winter will begin in a few days...
and the nights will last longer.
We will have more
time together and...
And a lot more pleasure.
Now why did you have
to use such a word?
It was like...
braving your anger and...
your insults at the same time.
You got that wrong, Saheb.
It was only anger.
The insults played
around in my head.
They were meant for the night
that went by so quickly.
It's not...
pleasure.
But a sense of calm
that you provide.
What do I mean to you?
You are...
my...
habit.
Well, habits can change.
Correct.
Therefore...
don't turn into a vice that...
I'll be forced to stop.
Here's 20,000 rupees.
I'll send more soon.
I don't need all of this.
You wish to contest the election...
for which you'll need money.
I will start saving more of it.
Earlier you insulted me
with your insolence...
and now you are killing
me with your prudence.
Why are you taking offence
to every word of mine?
You keep reminding me with
every word that I am broke.
That I need support...
that I am in want of money.
I need to look after
you all your life...
and I will.
Saheb!
No, listen to me.
Lodge a complaint with the
cops that you suspect Saheb.
Oh really! You want me to
complain with the cops?
Or tell Kapoor's family to
lodge a complaint with the cops.
That's very smart of you!
You want me to officially declare
that Saheb and I are enemies?
And when he is killed,
nobody will ever suspect me!
Who even appointed you as minister?
Who appointed me as minister?
I told you this is my office.
Stop buzzing around like mosquito!
Now wait a minute!
Yes!
- Yes sir?
Stop calling me sir and don't
think you can screw around with me!
You were sent to do something,
what's the status?
That's precisely why I called!
Saheb spends every
night with his whore.
Is it every night or
whenever he feels like it?
Gainda Singh, will you keep it
down... it's Saheb on the line.
Hello! Yes, Saheb?
Minister...
I heard that Kapoor is no more.
My area would have prospered...
had businessmen like
Kapoor invested here.
In my area it is my people
that should prosper, minister.
What's the status of my file, sir?
As soon as Saheb is gone,
your file will also vanish.
Your support is all
I ask for, Saheb.
You know it's not easy
to make friends at my age.
There's an English phrase...
'a leopard can never
change his spots'.
What was that?
Let me write it down.
This is what I like about you.
Apart from the votes,
I even get pearls of wisdom.
This just proves that no matter
what you do... a dog's tail...
can never be straight!
Is that so?
That phrase is true for
both of us, Prabhu Tiwari.
The only difference is I'm
the leopard... Leopard.
And you're the dog.
I've hired some assassins,
I'll send them to Devgadh.
Let me know when he goes there.
Nothing is fixed...
but he does go there
a few nights every week.
I shall kill you, Prabhu Tiwari...
and believe me it
will be my pleasure.
In the elections...
I will defeat you.
We will kill him
when he is with his whore.
Yes, sir.
What did he say?
What did he say?
He said he will contest
the elections against me.
What have you thought about it?
I don't want to think.
I suggest you come up
with a plan to get rid of him.
Now you're talking like a minister.
Don't move... Madam is watching.
Pull the bed sheet.
This is a
consequence of the songs...
you sing for her at night.
If Saheb gets as much as
a whiff about this...
neither will you be able to
play the guitar... nor sing.
You'll spend the rest of your
life counting stars from a bed.
Ever since I got here either
I have heard nonsense or warnings.
Don't confuse my respect
for uncle as my weakness.
I know what this palace and the
people around here are truly like.
Very soon all of them
will be resigned to history.
Once upon a time
there was a king...
and his queen...
- Babloo, get the car.
What happened last night?
- Sorry?
Nothing at all.
I was singing a song for you and...
well, suddenly you took ill.
You must be very bad at singing.
I guess.
Nothing else happened, right?
Of course not.
I remember everything...
I know what you did.
Opportunist!
My eyes were deceived and
I fell in love
My eyes were deceived and
I fell in love
A cheat you came
along and I trusted you
A no-good con artist
like you I trusted
A cheat you came
along and I trusted you
My eyes were deceived and
I fell in love
My eyes were deceived and
I fell in love
Ever since I looked into your eyes
Ever since I looked into your eyes
My eyes were deceived and
I fell in love
What's the matter? Tell me!
Soon you will be gone...
Sundar is much better now.
How about another fracture?
It was a joke!
It's probably a joke for you...
but I believe it to be true.
What?
I am in love with you.
You will go away...
leaving me behind all alone...
and sick.
I'll ask Saheb to give
me a job at the palace.
Only people loyal to him
get to live at the palace.
Are you loyal to him?
No.
What are you looking at?
You are...
- I'll tell you...
you don't have class.
You are a brute!
I'm not worthy of this.
I am aware of your worth.
Opportunist! Please don't say that!
I'II...
take up a job at the palace.
And...
I will earn Saheb's loyalty
and become...
your Saheb.
Really? How?
That's enough.
What else have you told Gainda Singh?
I told him that...
you meet a woman at Shikaar Baadi.
What do I do with you?
Give me...
a job over here, Saheb.
I will guard you with my life.
I confessed that I was
working for Gainda Singh.
You can kill me if you wish.
I have...
proved my loyalty.
Lock him up.
Gainda Singh will attack you, Saheb.
Gainda Singh will attack you.
Be careful.
Gainda Singh will...
attack you.
Trust me, Saheb...
In search of the
fragrance I flew high and away
But in the jungle I went astray
Will I turn into a star someday
Or remain here as an innocent loser
Come on soon!
Saheb...
Sir...
Saheb!
This is for you.
Saheb has sent this for you.
But why?
You aren't just a driver anymore.
Saheb feels you can be trusted...
but I don't.
You don't think I can be trusted?
People who are loyal don't question.
Saheb feels you can be trusted...
and I didn't question him.
Listen carefully.
Okay.
If you make another mistake...
Saheb will be upset.
But I will kill you.
How's the pain?
It's much better now.
Because of him I got to retire.
I've fulfilled my responsibility.
You think a traitor
can ever be responsible?
He has confessed to his mistake.
The mistake is yet to happen.
Now it's merely the
thought of making one.
Happy Birthday...
your Highness.
Thank you.
I heard you were attacked.
Did you find out who they were?
Well...
there are plenty out there
who don't want me alive.
This is for you.
I hope you'll like it.
You shouldn't have!
I have more than 400 sarees...
and I haven't worn some...
- Surely you can accept it.
It has been paid for with your money.
Girdhari...
set the table.
Sure.
You can spare me the
sarcasm for today.
At least once a year...
you can accord me some respect.
Trust me, I do try. But...
sorry.
This is for you.
Oh no!
You have provided us with everything.
Please.
I am giving it to you.
It's my wish...
take it.
Oops...
sorry.
How did you get hurt?
It's nothing...
There was some water
and I didn't see it...
You didn't see it? You
really didn't see it.
When Saheb was leaving the palace...
did you not look at him?
He was wearing a bullet-proof vest.
I'm sure it was obvious,
but you didn't see.
I sent you there to spy for me...
and you are enjoying
the palace as a tourist!
That's not true, sir.
Babloo...
you aren't taking this seriously.
Guess you've forgotten that you
are accused for attempt to murder.
I'm sorry for your loss.
The Lord decides everything.
This is Babloo.
- Give me a cigarette!
Babloo...
your case is in his hands.
Seek his blessings and you
will be safe. - Greetings, sir.
I am sorry about your father.
Cut the crap!
Did you know him?
Listen carefully.
The Lakhimpur Bridge
contract will be out soon.
I want to know Saheb's bid.
You are very good at kite flying,
I didn't know this.
If you continue to stay at home...
you will learn a lot about me.
Kanhaiya...
why don't you shoot me...
so I can't leave home.
Allow me the honor.
I will shoot you...
so that you can't go anywhere.
Is that so?
Yes.
Good afternoon sir.
I met Gainda Singh.
He wants to know what you are
bidding for the Lakhimpur Bridge.
200 million.
Tell him.
He will bid a lower
amount and get the contract.
I will set up a new
company in Madam's name...
and enter another bid at 150 million.
Why don't you go out for a drive?
Babloo... get the car.
Yes.
I don't feel like going out.
I am fine.
I have...
a headache.
But I don't want to go!
Just because you are good at
flying kites doesn't mean...
you let my words fly
out into the open.
Now go.
She breathes for her husband
But she has many lovers
She breathes for her husband
But she has many lovers
She is nobody's slave
She strikes like lightning
Come and be mine
Oh be mine
Her walk sets my heart on fire
Her steps put me under a spell
No, don't need it.
Who is that?
The cure for Saheb's headache.
She looks amazing And she is sensuous
She loves to flirt
She's more intoxicating than wine
Come and be mine
Oh be mine
Babloo, turn the car around.
I want to go home.
But why? What's wrong?
She was going in and
I was stepping out...
eventually that's what will happen.
How dare she...
I want to go home.
Why are you worried about her?
Who the hell is she?
Stop the car... I want to go home.
Her moves are swift and fast
She can be crazy
Lalit...
Lalit...
Lalit...
Lalit...
Lalit...
I am here.
- Lalit...
I am here.
- Lalit...
I am right here.
I wasn't calling out to you.
I was calling out to him...
who was killed by them.
Who killed...
They killed Lalit.
But why?
Because he loved me.
Only he ever...
truly loved me.
Before your wedding?
Even I love you.
And they will kill you too.
I will be fine.
Before they can kill us...
you should kill them all.
Kill whom?
Mahua.
Why are you worried about her,
let her be with Saheb.
As long as she is alive...
Saheb will squander
every thing for her.
I will be resigned to
a room in the palace...
and you will be her chauffeur.
Fine, I'll kill her, then what?
Saheb's trips will be over
and so will our time together.
Do you like meeting like this?
No.
We'll meet without any fear.
Restore my status back
to where it truly belongs.
Then I will claim my right.
Yes?
Okay, that's fine.
You too.
Got some good news after ages.
I got the contract.
That's great, Saheb.
You better stop
shedding those tears...
the chicken will turn out salty.
- Sir!
That was a huge contract.
I think about it and start crying.
Don't worry...
you can have the tender chicken leg.
- Sir...
I am a vegetarian.
Vegetarian!
Gainda Singh...
this wasn't necessary.
Perhaps the red beans are
actually black eyed beans.
It's alright, sir.
We aren't out on the streets, sir.
We'll get some other contract.
That's the spirit.
That's the spirit, Mr. Tandon.
- How can you say that, sir?
We had to travel up
and down a hundred times.
We even paid Gainda
Singh quite a hefty amount.
It's alright, Kashyap.
Sir, you may think it's alright...
but I've got to manage the business.
How can we conduct business...
on false promises?
That's enough!
Now why would you do that?
Mr. Tandon is a vegetarian.
My heart is already burning
with anger over my own mistake...
then why did he have
to stoke the flame!
Sir...
Sir... my wife had warned me...
about conducting
business in this area.
The people over here aren't
as bad as you think they are.
Conduct your business...
not your wicked deeds.
Saheb...
it's Mr. Tandon.
I apologize that you had
to walk through the jungle.
You see, it's a small area...
and there aren't many
places to have a secret meeting.
That's alright, sir.
- How are you?
It's okay, he works for me.
Tell me something...
if you had won the
contract for the bridge...
what would be your cut?
About 60-70 million, sir.
Okay.
I suggest...
you give me 30 million...
and you can construct it.
I mean, I'd rather not get
into this construction thing.
But...
but if I join hands with you...
Tiwari and Gainda Singh will...
come...
come after me.
Why don't you stay back,
we'll cook a deer for you.
You see, I am a vegetarian, sir.
And I need to get to Delhi.
There's a flight in
two hours from Lucknow.
Great! I'll come
along with you to Delhi.
You can arrange for my lunch and...
the money.
But what about
Tiwari and Gainda Singh?
If you would have received
this contract, do you think...
I would spare your life?
I have had people killed in Delhi.
Alright, let's go.
There's something
about these clothes...
and it feels good.
What do you think?
I think you look
better without clothes.
Well that's only in bed.
Get used to seeing me
with my clothes on too.
It's not only in bed
that we'll be together.
This is how you'll walk with me.
Come...
closer to me.
Now who is this black stone for?
You.
I am black?
It's because you sneak
in at night in the dark.
Massage my feet.
What?!
Why...
Is there a problem?
I don't think Saheb
ever gave you this joy.
A little over here...
it hurts a lot.
Answer!
Saheb!
Yes, sir?
Okay, sir.
Okay.
I have to take Mahua to Lucknow.
Saheb will come
back there from Delhi.
You can kill Mahua on the way.
A car accident...
or shoot her, say you were attacked.
Prabhu Tiwari...
Hold on...
let me think.
Continue with the massage...
it helps me think.
I don't want this joy.
I'm not used to it.
Saheb himself will kill Mahua.
How?
How?
I want you to tell me, how?
I haven't seen you before.
It's only recently that I got to
this position that I could be seen.
You have a good sense of humor.
Are you educated?
I'm a graduate.
Really?
At least I have interesting company.
I'll send my stuff.
Excuse me, please... please...
my phone battery has died out.
May I use yours?
Sure.
- Thank you.
Babloo...
listen to me.
Stop calling me.
I asked you to do something...
but it backfired on me.
But sir, it's not my fault.
I informed you about the
bid amount for the contract.
Of course, it's not your fault.
Apparently, your
star signs and mine...
don't seem to match.
Get lost...
move it.
Now, before I get hurt again...
I think we should end
our relationship, Okay?
Please don't say that, sir.
Right now, I'm about to give
you some juicy information.
And then you can either kill me...
or do anything you want with me.
Go on!
Saheb and his darling
will spend the night...
at Jaiswal's farm house.
Kanhaiya will be there and...
so will I.
Choose an auspicious
hour for your attack.
Fine.
This better be good because...
even if Saheb gets out alive...
I'll make sure you die.
Welcome...
Hello!
Please come!
You have a nice place.
- Thank you.
Sir...
darling is at the venue...
the other is yet to come.
Should be here soon.
Inform me immediately.
Alright, sir.
So... who lives here?
- Well...
Excuse me...
your phone.
It was in the car.
Saheb is calling.
Hello...
yes, I am here.
Okay.
He will be here soon.
Oh! Very nice.
Welcome Saheb.
How are you, Jaiswal?
Everything in order?
- Don't worry about anything.
Everything has been taken care of.
My servant and I are here.
I gave the others a day off.
- Thank you Jaiswal.
With elections around the
corner we have to be cautious...
about what we do.
- Exactly.
With whom we spend time...
- Don't you worry at all.
Madam is inside.
Yes!
- Not her...
I was talking about you.
Oh yes!
- See you in the morning.
Working on your shopping list?
No...
I was anxiously waiting for you.
Would you like some tea?
Tea... at this hour?
Kanhaiya!
Wow!
A record player!
Does it play?
- I'll check.
There are four people.
So, we'll storm in?
Where are you?
Behind the tree
that's in front of you.
Now?
No, wait...
Enter only when I tell you to.
Okay.
He betrayed us.
Babloo!
Saheb, he told me...
there would be no one else but...
Hail the king!
Let them chant some more...
I'll be out soon.
Let's go.
What is it? Now what's troubling you?
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me, Saheb?
Take a look at this mobile bill.
You are only supposed to sign,
Madhavi.
Not go through the call list.
What if Mahua's bill is
comparatively high this month?
I care a damn...
if she fritters away your wealth.
But I won't tolerate...
if she plays around with your life.
What are you talking about?
Check the numbers called on the 12th.
A particular number was called twice.
What... whose number is it?
Was.
It was Gainda Singh's number.
That's the day he attacked you.
Another drink?
What's the matter?
You seem lost.
Listen...
tell me something.
What?
I know I have loved you...
and also made you cry.
Have I given you more love...
or tears?
Both.
Saheb...
Saheb...
Saheb...
Here they come, loud and strong
Hundreds they've
brought to the ground
Here they come, loud and strong
Hundreds they've
brought to the ground
The kings now hold the reins
Having tasted blood
from a thousand veins
Quick and fast, to get things done
Swift and brave, under the same sun
Quick and fast, to get things done
Swift and brave, under the same sun
The path is fraught
with untold danger
No one ever got out alive
Walked from miles only to reach
The spot he had just gone by
Round and round goes the maze
Spells and witchcraft abound
Everything here is upside down
Heaven help, oh the terrible sins
Swindlers trapped by
their own wicked djinns
Oh how the sinister plot unfolds
Spells and witchcraft abound
Everything here is upside down
Heaven help, oh the terrible sins
Swindlers trapped by
their own wicked djinns
Oh how the sinister plot unfolds
We are landlords and we don't need
to beg for anything from anyone!
Once was a king very tough
And his queen with unbridled love
The king was also charming and mild
But the queen's temper,
untamed and wild
Along came a bloke following his luck
With the might of a storm he struck
The king and queen
were hooked to his jingles
And he pulled their
strings with his fingers
Round and round goes the maze
Spells and witchcraft abound
Everything here is upside down
Heaven help, oh the terrible sins
Swindlers trapped by
their own wicked djinns
Oh how the sinister plot unfolds
Who is it?
It's me.
Come in.
Wake up!
Shall I add a large one to the tea?
Your day will be a breeze.
Why don't you talk a
little less in the morning!
Have you gone blind?
Had you done this a long
time ago, I would've relented.
But now...
Let me go or I will scream!
I do the same thing...
your father does...
Suman.
Wait a minute!
My forefathers have been
commanders of the army here.
They had taken an oath
to protect Saheb's family.
My father is the commander.
But I only want to marry you.
Morning, sir.
What's the news?
Everything is...
under control.
Mr. Tandon is coming over today.
Greetings, Saheb.
Suman, something special today?
Saheb...
today is my birthday.
Oh...
Congratulations!
Thank you, Saheb.
Bless you.
My best wishes to you, Suman.
Thank you.
Happy birthday...
to you.
Father...
- Bless you.
Suman.
Yes, Saheb?
This is for you.
You have always provided
all that I need, Saheb.
Take it, Suman.
You shouldn't refuse.
Thank you.
- How old are you?
Sorry...
I know it's not right to ask.
Well, she has come of age, Saheb.
In that case, aren't you
thinking about her marriage?
With your blessings...
why should I worry about it?
Babloo...
for how long will
you wander all alone?
You should marry Suman.
You won't find a girl as nice as her.
Sir, but I...
Listen, both of you are educated...
and you will get a
good job in the city.
Do you intend wasting
your youth in this village?
Kanhaiya, do you have any objection?
You...
could get her
married to a rock, Saheb.
Sir...
but...
I am...
- Suman
do you have any objection?
Hello Babloo...
Babloo...
the petrol pump guy
refused to give petrol.
He said I should get
a note from Kanhaiya.
I was insulted.
Hello Babloo...
Will you inform him that I am here.
Saheb should be here soon.
It's my daughter's
wedding invitation.
Mr. And Mrs. Aditya Pratap Singh?
You haven't invited me?
I will organise a grand
party for all of you later.
But why later?
You don't think I'm worthy
of attending the wedding?
It's not like that.
Then what is it?
I'm the customer service guy.
Can't get through
Saheb so I should call him!
Don't you talk to me like that!
Is Saheb angry?
No, not Saheb, I am angry at you.
What I can't be angry
at you, you bastard?
I can't be angry?
- Hey...
what's going on?
- Who do you think you are?
Babloo...
what happened?
He was insulting Saheb
and I couldn't bear it.
What?
- I was insulting Saheb?
Kanhaiya... that's an absolute lie.
I came here with my
daughter's wedding invitation.
Please come inside.
Saheb will return at night...
he is at a nearby village.
Listen!
Listen!
Come down, I want to speak with you.
Come down right now, I
have to speak with you.
What the hell is going on?
You got Saheb back and...
you are getting me married
to Suman and sending me away.
Everything I did, I did it for you.
This way it's better for you.
You get to be with both.
I want you!
Take it there.
Now!
You were fooling around with me!
I know you are behind
this plan to send me away.
How could you even say that?
And what's wrong with it?
It's good for everyone.
You will get a job in the city.
We have been meeting clandestinely...
and we will continue to do so.
I don't want to continue like that.
And nor do I want to work somewhere.
I will stay here...
and you will stay with me.
Not as Madam...
but as the Queen.
As for Saheb...
I will get rid of him.
What do you mean?
You will kill him?
If you wish, he will breathe
his last begging at your feet.
Babloo...
Babloo...
our affair is confined to a room...
and it's no more than a bed.
Please let it be.
You are scared.
I will change everything in two days.
Saheb...
we belong to four villages and...
we are here because
we are in trouble.
There is a man-eating
leopard in the jungle.
He has already killed five of us.
Complain to the forest department.
Sir, we are from the
forest department.
We neither have the means nor
weapons to kill the leopard.
We have requested for weapons
but don't know when we'll get them.
Until then he could
kill some more of us.
Yes, he will kill us!
Please kill the leopard.
We will be grateful to you.
As you wish.
Day after tomorrow I
will camp out in the jungle.
Keep track of where the
leopard was last seen.
What is this?
What?
I told you to come alone.
And are you all alone?
As much as you fear me...
I fear you just the same.
What...
what do you want?
I want to talk to him alone.
No, sir.
I can't leave you
alone with him. Hey!
Just say what you want to,
we don't have time to waste.
Lower your voice.
You see my thugs outside?
A loud voice is like a
danger signal to them.
I hope that our friendly
conversation isn't disturbed.
Hey!
Just a second!
You... out of the car...
I said out!
Come on... now!
Release Gainda Singh's
brother who is in prison.
Gainda Singh's brother? But why?
I am sure he is dying to kill Saheb.
He is a student, a decent guy.
It was because of you guys
that I had him locked up.
Saheb is contesting elections again.
And he will defeat you
because he has enough funding.
Therefore I want you to release him.
When Saheb is killed...
he will be the prime suspect.
You can lock him up again...
and you are secure.
What about you?
Me?
I will be the new Saheb.
Rukma!
Saheb...
before you come in,
I want to confess something.
You see...
it's about Babloo.
He has mistaken the way
I speak and my behavior...
to mean something else.
He says...
he is in love with me.
Please...
please make him go away from here.
He has over stepped his limits.
Please don't be upset with me.
It's not my fault.
Please, Saheb.
My thirst knows no bounds, O King!
Dig a well for me
Dig a well for me
My thirst knows no bounds, O King!
Dig a well for me
And if a well you can't dig
I suggest You set up a tap for me
Whatever you do...
don't shoot at his chest.
He wears a bullet-proof vest.
- Okay.
Now...
move it!
- Okay. - Take care.
And if water
doesn't flow from the tap
I suggest, you bring me the rains
Bring the rains.
- Sing it
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I hope you aren't upset with me.
Upset about what?
About last night.
The thing I told you about Babloo.
What are you talking about?
You told me nothing.
I hope you are taking
your medicines regularly.
Bring me such rains that
Bring me such rains that
Will last twelve months
Let the world get wet in those rains
Make sure some
thirst is left for later
Make sure some
thirst is left for later
Some thirst is left for later
Who was at the door the night before?

Greetings!
Greetings!
The leopard has been sighted.
About four kilometers
from here at Sitapur.
Go ahead, I'll have my
breakfast and join you.
Alright, sir.
Morning, sir.
I also want to come
with you to the jungle.
In the jungle you need to walk...
and you're not used to walking.
I'll be back in the evening.
I need to speak with you.
I have to tell you something.
Saheb!
Father!
Enough of your services...
time to take some rest.
Father!
You better not insult me today.
If I feel offended...
I may do something wrong.
What did you do?
Everyone will cry for a few days...
and then things will
be back to normal.
Enough of bowing to someone.
Now you will see others bow, uncle.
Where are you going?
I told you, I would
change everything in two days.
My queen...
I love you.
Only I truly love you.
You made me run around in
circles in your quest to be with him.
I will forget everything.
Everything.
Let's go.
Madhavi...
I told you...
I told you our affair
was confined to a room...
and was no more than a bed.
You will become the Saheb?
You don't look good giving orders.
If I were to stay with you...
people would pity
me and ridicule you.
Saheb!
King Aditya Pratap Singh... forever!
King Aditya Pratap Singh... forever!
Long live the queen!
Try to lift your hands higher.
They will think
you're getting better.
Thank you for your support,
and making us win the elections.
Who is he?
My new chauffeur.
