"O' breeze, bIow steaIthily."
"cupid plays flute."
"There is love in the air."
"O' breeze, bIow steaIthily."
"How can l teII this breeze.."
"..not to Iift the veil of damsel."
"Don't kindIe the desire in heart."
"O' breeze, bIow steaIthily."
Up in the morning and
aIready poking about in weeds?
Oh no! Not weeds..at least refer..
..to them as flowers and Ieaves.
I've been the caretaker
here for 14 Iong years.
And I've seen men of many
kinds come up to the hiIIs.
Some come here as tourists..
some for their health..
..some others to
spoiI their heaIth too.
But you're the first
who comes hunting for weeds.
Not "weeds".
.l'm a professor of
Botany..the science of pIants.
Ah! You put rubbish
into the heads of chiIdren!
Whoever Iet you
teach in the schooI!
The Government of lndia did.
The Government does
aIl the wrong things.
WelI, have you any
news of your grandson?
How is he?
-God only knows.
Neither have I received
a letter from the vilIage..
..nor from the Government.
Why don't you leave to see them?
It's a matter of onIy a day.
Besides, there's no one here but me.
In a coupIe of days a group
of girIs are supposed to come here.
They'Il come in a couple of days.
By then you can be back.
If they come earIier,
I'll be fired from my job.
Your grandson is ilI..and here
you are bothering about the job!
I'll take care if anyone comes by.
Here.
keep this..and go
and visit your grandson.
Just a minute..
What's this!
That's what.
Now take off your shawI.
And put on my coat.
Now tell me, don't I Iook
Iike an originaI caretaker?
There's no fear of Iosing the job.
Now you can go.
But give me the keys.
But how will you go?
It's through the mountain pass.
About 4 or 5 hours' waIking.
-WeII then, be on your way.
caretaker!
coming, Madam!
come quickly.
And help us with the luggage.
Why don't you people
carry your own Iuggage?
Don't make the poor feIIow sIog.
Here comes the Communist.
What has Communism to do with it?
Yes..at your service, Ma'am.
-Please carry this luggage.
Please proceed.
I'll carry the luggage in.
Will somebody help me down please!
Here, Iet me give you a hand.
You won't be able
to take the weight.
Hey! Where do you
think you're going?
Help me out first!
-Yes, yes. Certainly.
Just a minute! One minute!
Yes, come down now.
-Not a strong care-taker, are you?
We've got a reservation starting
tomorrow. -But we're here earIy.
Have you made any arrangements?
-Everything's arranged.
Here, take the keys.
Please proceed.
Girls! Get Moving!
There seems to be only
one other person staying here.
What's the name?
Mr. ParimaI Tripathi!
Sulekha! come over here. Quickly!
Mr. ParimaI Tripathi
is staying here.
Mr. ParimaI Tripathi!
How do you know?
It's written here. Room No. 8.
come, let's take a Iook.
Here's Room No. 8.
But where is Professor Tripathi?
Why don't you calI out?
What are you doing here?
Please go to your room.
Is Prof. Tripathi staying here?
-Yes.
He's someone with the Govt.
Some doctor of grass and weeds.
What a shame! Not weeds..
..refer to them as flowers
and Ieaves at least. Will you?
Do you happen to know him?
-Yes.
All of us are botany students.
And we study books written by him.
Where can we find
Professor Tripathi?
He's gone to see his grandson.
I thought he was a young man.
He's an oId man. A very old man.
When is he coming back?
-When are you going away?
After 2-3 days.
He'II return after 2-3 days then.
He doesn't like crowds.
Now, please go to your rooms.
Go on, move it. Good girIs.
caretaker! Caretaker!
coming Ma'am. Coming!
We're very hungry.
-That's what I'm trying to state.
Is there any arrangement
for food? -No.
There's only water for bathing.
Where do you get food from?
-The restaurant over there.
WelI then,
make some arrangements for us too.
It's difficuIt to make
arrangement for so many peopIe.
In that case,
we'II give you some tips..
Keep this.
Only 2 rupees!
The professor tips me in fivers!
Besides,
you have such a huge contingent.
Very well. Here's a fiver.
-And your arrangements are made!
can you serve us tea around 3 p.m.
Down there?
That wouId be quite difficult.
I can't leave my post.
can't you..
Oh! can't you?
WelI, l can, you know.
Tell me, where do you want it?
Over there.
-lt'lI be sent.
Make sure you get some eggs,
bread and butter too.
I'll get alI 5 of these for you.
-Five? What five?
Bread, butter, eggs, tea and me!
Seem to be a smart one, don't you?
And what do I do with the change?
Keep it.
-l'll thank the Lord for it!
He's given you as Iarge a heart.
What do you mean?
-Nothing ma'am! Nothing at all.
Girls! Come here.
-Yes, Ma'am.
I'll hold a class at
3'O cIock sharp. Down there.
collect your specimens
and get the whole Iot down there.
Understand? At 3 Sharp, then.
Ok.
-Ok
This is the Corolla of the flower,
as you already know.
Now cut out the Corollas
in your specimens.
You will remember that I'd
told you about compound flowers..
..Iike the MarigoId.
The marigold isn't a singIe fIower.
A marigoId is a bouquet
of smaller flowers.
Every petaI in a marigold,
is, in fact, a flower.
Now separate the
compound flowers among..
..the specimens you've collected.
Ma' am! -Let's take
a break for snacks.
These eggs are raw
How else could they be?
You shouId've got them boiIed.
-l wasn't told to get them boiIed.
I thought you were having a picnic!
You'd boiI them over here!
Never mind. I'II boiI the eggs.
-Where'd you get water?
There's a stream nearby.
If you couId heIp, it'd be quicker.
come. Let's get to work.
-Very welI. Let's go.
caretaker
-Yes, Ma'am.
Sit down. Sit down.
Has Professor Tripathi returned?
Not yet.
I see.
Why are you sitting over there?
I'll fetch a chair for you.
I'm aIright. Sit down.
-Let me get it for you.
Is Professor Tripathi
really an oId man?
He's old enough. But not very old.
His face is slightly crooked.
And when he speaks..his
face turns up..Iike this.
The poor fellow is
stricken with polio.
Why shouId you be unhappy
if that professor is oId?
No. It's just that
I read the other day that..
..rareIy has anyone excelIed
in Botany at as earIy an age.
These professors reach the "Youth"
at the age of 50 or thereabouts..
..when teeth start running
Ioose and hair starts falIing.
It's the youth of wisdom..
not the physicaI youth.
No, no. It's not like that.
Just that Dr Tripathi
hails from Allahabad.
So, you're from AlIahabad, are you?
Have you ever been
to AIIahabad? -No.
But who hasn't heard of it?
My eIder wife says that she..
-Elder wife ?!
Yes, I have 2 wives.
What about your chiIdren?
-Counting both the wives..
..12 children in all.
2 wives and 12 children.
Goodness!
Two wives! And tweIve children.
Sounds like the title of a movie.
It's not a good idea to
sit down and chat with caretakers.
What do you mean?
-The younger wife is quarrelsome.
If she sees me chatting
with you Iike this..
..she'Il tear my hair out.
Now, please go away from here.
Please go.
caretaker!
-Coming!
UncIe! You've already come!
Go to my room! ReIax!
He's my uncle.
Why did he answer my caII then?
-We're from the same caste.
caste?
-Yes. We're caretakers by caste.
So, it's a habit answering
to caIIs for caretakers.
can you get me some rope?
-Yes, l have.
Whom do you want to tie up?
-You!
Ma'am! -I have to
tie up the Iuggage.
Bring some rope if you have it.
-Yes. l'll go and get it.
What's aII this happening?
I had to do all this.
Otherwise,
yourjob would've been at stake.
No sooner had you Ieft,
than their bus came up.
I had to put in an act.
Now tell me, how your grandson is.
The temperature has subsided.
But he's still very weak.
Now get aIong, have a bath
and take a change of clothes.
I must continue the charade.
Otherwise,
they'II get to know who l am.
What do you mean?
They know me by name..
..as ParimaI Tripathi,
a professor of Botany.
Now go inside.
can I ask you why
you had put up the act?
I beg your pardon.
I've heard everything.
You've heard, have you!
Now, how couId this
poor fellow have gone..
.to see his grandson,
had I not put up a charade?
But, why were you asking
for tips every time?
Now tell me..
..without the 'Tip' part,
wouId it have been convincing?
Professor Tripathi..
..you've collected 12 rupees
for your act as caretaker.
WelI, yes.
Now please return the tips.
Yes, yes. certainly.
I don't have change on me.
Never mind. You can keep it aII.
Wait. Listen..
I want to take a Iook at Prof.
Tri-Pathi's poIio-
..stricken crooked face.
Please take the cap off.
-What !
Now take your cap off! EIse,
I'll let the cat out of the bag.
caretaker! Caretaker!
-Coming, Ma'am.
carry the Iuggage to the bus,
will you?
Goodness!
This bag is as heavy as she is.
Move it..Move it.
Is the Iuggage Ioaded?
Hey you! Help me in, wiII you?
-Yes, ma'am.
Now get the luggage, wiII you?
-Yes, yes.
come on, Sulekha. come on.
Let me heIp you.
-No.
Let me.. I won't ask for tips!
When Prof. Tripathi returns..
..wilI you give him
"Lots of Iove" from me?
I wilI.
-And here..take this.
What's this?
-Your tips.
Go on, keep it.
Good riddance.
Here, keep this.
She Ieft a tip.
What's in this piece of paper?
She has left her address.
The one who gave you the tip?
That's right.
-Praise be to the Lord.
You're his elder reIative, are you?
Yes.
You're his elder reIative,
are you? -Yes.
So Prof. Tripathi proposes that..
..l prove my inteIlectualism by..
..marrying off my sister
with someone from the caretakers!
I don't understand
what you mean to say.
But he's not a caretaker.
He's a fuII-fledged
doctor of the weeds.
A doctor of the weeds!
Is my sister a cow that
she might need weeding?
No.
Not the weeds in that sense.
He's a doctor of the
fIowers and the leaves.
One, whom you'd call
a "Professor" in EngIish.
Professors! They're absoIuteIy
useless creatures!
UseIess?
-They know of nothing but work!
This marriage cannot be..
..delayed!
Yes, I'm Prashant
Shrivastav speaking.
A trunk caII from AIIahabad?
Yes, yes. Pass it on.
A trunk caII?
Must be ParimaI.
You haven't met him.
We'd been in college together.
Parimal here.
What news of Bombay?
How's your wife?
She's fine. What makes you call?
I'm engaged to get married.
Getting married! Fantastic!
Who are you getting married to?
-A girI.
You must reach Allahabad with
your wife by the coming Friday.
It's short notice.
Why don't you come across
to Bombay after the marriage?
Yes. You can have a honeymoon here.
Has it disconnected?
-HelIo!
Darn telephones!
There's only one way to set them..
..right book them as criminals!
Just what l feared.
Miss pelt
And the fonts must be bold.
Take it to the press.
And check on the trunk
call I'd booked for Bombay.
Sumi! Come here quickly! There's
a trunk caII from AIIahabad!
How far have you gone
ahead with the marriage pIan?
Date-fixed! When?
-Next Friday. Just 6 days away.
It's a bit hectic
for me at this age.
Is it your marriage by any chance?
Not a chance in this Iifetime.
Why don't you come
over and help me?
But why aII of a sudden?
The boy's brother Iives in London.
He's here all aIone.
And the next auspicious
date is 2 months away.
He insists on this Friday.
So you must reach
in a coupIe of days.
Who's on the Iine?
-Speak to Sulekha.
Speak to your brother-in-Iaw.
-Brother-in-law!
Brother in Iaw
That's what you caII
"marrying in haste".
You've settled
for a poor professor.
Seems like you've
known him for Iong.
Strange! I haven't even met him.
-ls that so?
Now what's the name
of my competitor?
Pari-mal!
Now you're being naughty!
Is he any Iess?
But tell me seriousIy,
what does he Iook Iike?
All right, sort of..
-Weren't you telling me just now..
..that you haven't seen him?
Now he's "aII right, sort of.."
You can't get away with Iies.
Let me teII you something.
You'II find out how
it is ditching me..
..for Parimal,
after you've married.
Had a chat?
-Yes. Sulekha's marriage is fixed.
We must Ieave by
the day after tomorrow.
The marriage is on Friday.
This Friday?
-Yes.
But Ratna's fever doesn't
seem to be subsiding.
Today the temperature
seems to be higher.
Have you called the Doctor?
-Yes.
come, let's take a Iook.
Anything else, sir?
Another cup of tea for me.
You've had five
cups of tea already.
If l've taken five,
then l can take another, can't l?
It so happened that..
-Brother-in-law calIed. Right?
How do you know?
That's the onIy person
I get to hear of these days.
"My brother-in-law is Iike this,
he's Iike that.."
"..he caIIed us up today.
I must write to him today"
"..he said this..and
I must teII him that.."
Are you jeaIous of him?
No, I'm not.
But I'm sure that I've
deveIoped an inferiority compIex.
Must be some sort of a genius.
He used to be a barrister.
And now, he owns a soap factory.
He's a genius in everything!
Even a genius in his Iove Iife!
And he has made pots of money!
-Do you know..
..he could've become a
Minister if he wanted to, but..
He'd rather seII soap.
Isn't that so?
Don't poke fun at him.
He's stilI handsome.
-ReaIIy!
ShaII l show you his photograph?
You carry his photograph
around, do you?
Yes, I do. And I also
need his advice all the while.
Here, take a look.
This bald chicken!
I mean, er.. this bald gentIeman.
Then there isn't any danger.
And who's this beside him?
She's my sister.
I see. Must be his 3rd marriage.
The 1st! Why did you say 3rd?
-Goodness!
Did he lose all that
hair in one marriage!
You're bent upon poking fun.
Your sister reaIIy
Iooks Iike a daughter..
..standing by his side.
My sister has 2 daughters.
One is at schooI in ShimIa.
You were Iate coming. -And we're
wasting time here. Now move it.
Where do you want to go?
To meet your brother-in-Iaw!
Is that Hari ?..Raghav speaking.
We're in a fix here.
Ratna has fallen ill.
And the doctor suspects
that it might be typhoid.
What should we do now?
It'd be quite difficuIt
for you to come over in that case.
ShouId we postpone the
marriage for a coupIe of months?
No, no!
Do not postpone the marriage.
If Ratna recovers,
we'II try to attend.
Please expIain the
situation to SuIekha.
I'll caIl you up Iater.
Please send me
Parimal's photograph.
Very well.
Is he your brother-in-law?
You're obsessed with the
ghost of your brother-in-Iaw!
He isn't any ghost!
-None lesser, either.
The fellow in here
is like a younger sibIing.
He's a Professor in
EngIish in our college.
Is that ParimaI?
coming.. coming in a minute.
He's a very jovial chap..
and very bright, too.
Welcome!
I've been ringing your beIl
for so long! Have you been asIeep?
It's defective..doesn't ring.
The bells seem to be tolIing
for me. -What do you mean?
I've got engaged to marry.
-With whom ?
Let me introduce you.
Kumar, she's the
one who's marrying me.
And whom are you marrying?
-Her.
You mean to say you're
marrying each other, aren't you?
come in . come.
I can address you as sister-in-Iaw?
Yes, you may.
It's firm this time.
This time? What do you mean?
Several ladies have pursued
me earlier. But l didn't quite..
You mean to say that
I've been after you!
Now, when ever did
I say anything Iike that?
What l am saying is that,
this once, l've gone after her.
come.
This is the first time you've
come here. What wiII you have?
Nothing.
Besides, we'll get delayed.
My brother-in-Iaw's phoning..!
Forget it, Kumar.
She's getting a calI
from her brother-in-Iaw!
You'II get more than
a caII from relatives.
But I'm not letting
her go so easiIy.
This is the first
time you've come here..
WelI, all right.
The "tanpura" is here..
Let's have a song.
That's good. You sing first.
And Sulekha wiIl join us too.
She's a very accompIished singer.
-ReaIIy!
Then why don't you sing first?
No, you first !
-No, no! You first!
You first!
-Do we pick firsts, or do we sing?
WelI then,
why don't you sing a song first?
Very well then. l'll sing a song.
So you can sing too, can you?
Doctoring weeds..and singing?!
Did you hear, Kumar?
That's faith and respect
for the husband-to-be!
Let me enIighten her.
We even won the first prize
in coIIege when we sang together.
Isn't that so?..One minute.
-Take two.
And, why haven't you
told me that you sing?
You shouId know your husband's
plus points graduaIIy, SuIekha.
And Iove bIossoms gradually.
Now tell me, how do you
Iike this friend of mine?
A nice feIIow.
Is he married yet?
Watch it Iady! What are you up to?
Are you thinking of replacing me?
-Shame on you!
He's addressing me as a
Bhabhi (sister-in-law) and you!..
I was thinking of Rupa.
She's studying in ShimIa.
She's my brother-in-law's
eIder daughter.
No! Never!
-Why not?
First, because she's your
brother-in-Iaw's daughter!
Secondly, l have a friend,
Prashant, Iiving in Bombay.
When he came here recently..
..Prashant deveIoped
a friendship with him.
He has a sister
(marriageable) and..
..Kumar likes Prashant very much.
Now tell me,
don't we Iook Iike twins?
come on, Iet's show her
what a doctor of the weeds..
No! Not weeds!
Leaves and flowers at least!
WelI.. -AIright.
Get aIong with the song.
"Song or music was created first?"
"Both the hearts united
at the same time."
"This is a song of
Iove for the worId."
"The way hearts unite,
melodies unite too."
"Music is composed then."
"Let the worId hear it.."
It isn't for you.
It's for the bridegroom.
Open it up. Take a Iook at it.
A priceless gift!
-Caretaker!
Don't you ask for a tip!
-l've taken the tip aIready.
I think it's indigestion
due to overeating.
We've had 30 Iunches
and 30 dinners in 20 days.
25 breakfasts and 15 tea parties..
none Iess.
Why, are you afraid that
you won't get to eat any more?
Not me..my friends were afraid
that I might not marry again.
The probIem is that his friends
have aIl their love for us..
..stowed up in the stomach,
not in their hearts.
Drop 2 meals and
have these medicines.
No, I can't eat anything,
much Iess medicines.
I'd sooner eat a buIIet.
You needn't eat them.
Just swaIIow them with water.
I am going.
Sit down.
What are we going to do
about the invitation tonight?
He's an oId friend
of mine and he'll..
..mind it if we don't attend.
Your friends are inconsiderate.
In 20 days of marriage, never
have we had time for ourselves.
Just tonight, pIease.
-Never !
I swear this by you!..
That for at least a month
I won't accompany you to any party.
Why don't we settIe for dinner
tonight and swearing tomorrow?
Never! Never!! Never !!!
It isn't even a month of marriage
and you're already making faces!
Yes, brother come.
Have you had a quarrel?
-No, nothing that serious.
Now Iet me set the mood right.
I've brought an invitation
for the two of you.
What?
-Oh, no!
Why? What's wrong with that?
Please don't speak
of anymore invitations.
The mere mention is enough
to give us indigestion.
That's what we were fighting over.
Listen me.
Raghav has invited you to Bombay.
-Brother-in-law!
Yes. Now Iisten.
My Revered Brother-in-Iaw, Haripad,
It is my heartfeIt wish that
you have the couple en route..
..for Bombay at the earliest.
-Apart from heaIthfuI aspects..
..of a change of climate..
..the sojourn wiIl
help the newly-married..
..in the bIossoming of intimacy..
..into a budding reIationship
for stronger ties.
Was that the brother-in-Iaw
or was it the AII lndia Radio?
Now that's a fetish with Raghav.
Insists on using
a perfect Ianguage.
It's just that we should do.
At least we'll be abIe
to avoid those parties.
No. This invitation
is not acceptabIe.
Why? -Your sister
has sworn it on me..
..not to accept any invitations.
But I didn't swear it about..
An invitation is an invitation.
You've sworn it by me. I can't
bear it to see my wife widowed!
Enough ofjokes.
Now please make arrangements
for the trip to Bombay.
No. It simpIy isn't possibIe
for us to go to Bombay.
I'll leave you to
sort out your probIem.
I've Ianded in a
grave probIem. -What ?
Your brother-in-law
has put me in a fix.
He wants a driver from AIIahabad.
Why? Why one from AlIahabad?
Because you can't get a driver..
..spea-King the pristine Ianguage in Bombay.
How will I find such a driver
these days, even in Allahabad?
I can, sureIy find for thy sake,
such a chauffeur of vehicIes.
Er..what?
What did you say you'd find for me?
A chauffeur of vehicIes..
meaning thereby..a driver.
Oh, I see.
You'd rather say it simpIy.
I'd be obIiged if you
can provide such a person.
Now, who's he?
I am, at thy service, Sire.
This way, you'd be able to
solve your probIem and mine, too.
She'd be able to wriggle
out of her oath..
..and we'd meet my co-brother.
After all, a job is no invitation.
I couIdn't quite get to understand.
I'll explain.
I'll depart for Bombay tomorrow,
with a letter from you.
Masquerading as a driver!
Yes. In the first act, l go over.
In the second act..
..say about a week Iater,
you can come down too.
You'II get caught in a second!
Did you recognize the caretaker?
Might've been so with me.
But my brother-in-Iaw..he can..
..tell who you are,
he'lI smeII you out.
Besides, he has seen
your photographs, too.
I'll bet, he stiII won't
be abIe to recognize me
chaIIenge?
In the last 20 days after my
marriage I've heard of this genius..
..of a brother-in-law
for at Ieast 20,000 times.
An incarnation of God, it'd seem.
And she's deeply influenced by him.
Please allow me
this opportunity so..
..l may carve my
place in her heart.
I must prove that I measure
no less than her brother-in-law.
You're bound to
get caught and then..
..you'd notch an even lesser esteem.
Please grant me this one chance.
Just Iet me have a few
strong letters of introduction..
..and inform that genius.
I mean, her brother-in-law..
..that a thoroughbred
driver has been sent.
Sulekha wiIl reach
in another day or two.
The husband ParimaI,
that boorish doctor..
..of the weeds, is away in Patna.
Hurry up then. l'll pick
up the letter this evening.
Not a bad idea. But you'd
better give it another thought.
See you, Sulekha.
Watch the fun now.
Not even a month of marriage..
and you're leaving me behind.
Think of meeting again,
after a speII of separation.
Big deal! In any case,
you'II live in the garage..
..and l, in the bungaIow above,
even if you don't get caught.
I can always come to you..
or you can come down to me.
No thank you.
Decent girIs don't
meet drivers on the sIy.
The fun of love Iies in secrecy,
my dear.
But you shouIdn't be worried.
That will never happen.
You'II be caught before
anything of the sort happens.
You've onIy just heard of him.
You'II know my brother-in-law,
when you meet him.
The brother-in-Iaw again!
What's up?
Why are you laughing at yourself?
Here you are.
Your brother-in-law's photograph.
Has a good sense of humor.
This isn't the doing
of a doctor of Botany.
It's Sulekha's handiwork.
When is Sulekha coming?
-ln another 6 or 7 days.
But ParimaI is expected a
coupIe of days after she arrives.
He has gone to Patna
for a Iecture or something.
Your brother wiIl inform
us of the expected date.
So, my daughter is going to schooI!
Has the schooI bus arrived?
I hope you have no temperature.
Let me take a Iook No, there isn't.
I don't want to send
Ratna to schooI by bus.
A school-bus overturned.
It was on the news.
James drives worse.
Forget driving,
he'lI even spoiI her Ianguage.
He speaks a pitten Ianguage.
Why don't you get
another chauffeur?
As it is, we need 2 chauffeurs.
I've been making enquiry's.
And your brother is
aIso sending a chauffeur.
It's a calI from Allahabad.
You've live long!
We were taIking about you!
What about the driver!
-He's on his way to Bombay.
The car wiII probabIy be Iate.
He's a bit of an eccentric.
-An eccentric!
He was quite unwilIing to go over.
I've convinced him somehow.
What was that about
his being "eccentric" ?
Don't worry.
He's just what you've asked for.
Very well-versed in Urdu and Hindi.
And, the ones of this
kind are a bit eccentric.
Just as you, yourseIf are.
Show him in.
He seems to have arrived.
Whatever he might seem to be..
..outwardIy, he's a fine feIlow.
I'll vouch for him.
The rest of our program stands.
convey my regards
to everyone. Bye..
Okay.
Ok brother.
Your brother has given you love..
..SuIekha is arriving as scheduIed.
Where are you going? This
fellow has come from AIIahabad.
Let's meet him.
Sit down
can I come in, Sahib?
-Come in, come in.
Greetings, Sahib.
-God bless you.
This is my..
-l know, Sahib.
What do you know? -She's
your eIder daughter, Ms. Rupa.
Oh no! Not my daughter!
She's my wife.
I beg your pardon. Oh, I remember..
..your daughter is
in schooI at Shimla.
Isn't that so? I beg your pardon.
Greetings to you, too.
Your name..l forget..
Are you married? Or singIe?
WelI, as of now, l'm singular.
I hope the journey was pIeasant.
-Have you eaten anything as yet?
I have partaken of a meaI at the
station of the Iocomotive train.
I have traveled by the chariot of
fire (steam engine-pulled train).
I see! You've come here by train!
Yes. That's what
it is called in English.
But I don't think it's
desirable to mix languages.
What's there to laugh about?
What nonsense!
No, not "what nonsense".
You shouId rather
say 'KYA BAKWAS HAI"
It's not desirabIe to use EngIish
words whiIe speaking in Hindi.
Do you know English?
-l do not Iike the language, Sahib.
Why so?
-A very unscientific Ianguage.
cUT is pronounced 'Cut'.
PUT is pronounced as in 'Foot'.
TO is too, DO is doo.
GO is go as in foe.
Tell me, ma'am. Why is GO not GOO?
(GOO in Hindi means darn!)
(In Hindi) D AD A is daadaa,
KAKA is kaakaa and..
BABA is certainly not bibi !
(Bibi in Hindi means wife)
But that is the way of English.
What sort of a "way" is this?
But I'm not reaIly
educated in English.
I'll learn it now from you.
I'll buy a book right today!
I must use my proximity
to a Iearned man.
Don't you think so, Madam?
-WeII, weII. Now l've 2 cars..
A Fiat and a Mercedes.
-How do you know?
I took a look before
coming in, Sahib.
I mean -BAHUT (Very )
ACHHE (Good).
The Mercedes was constructed
in 1969, and the Fiat in 1973.
By construction he means "modeI".
-l know, I know.
My driver is James.
Take the keys from
him and bring the car out.
Which car, sir?
The fiat. After dropping
the Sahib at his office..
..l want to go shopping,
Pyaremohan -Very well.
Why must you address me
in the fulI form of my name?
I'd rather, you called me PYARE
Mr. Haripad addresses me likewise.
Alright. You may go now.
-As you command, sir.
The fellow Iooks more like
a film actor, than a driver.
Talks a lot of nonsense, though.
-Haripad warned me about it.
But he also said that
he's realIy a very good person.
I'm afraid of one thing.
He has just about
threatened me that..
..he's buying a book
to learn English from me.
But how am I to expIain
why "go" is not "goo" ?!
He does speak a very pure Hindi.
-Without doubt!
come, let's take a Iook.
Sire!
Greetings.
Your good name?
What do you mean?
And I'm called
Pyaremohan AIIahabadi.
I'm the new automobile driver.
What?
-l'm the new driver.
Please let me have the keys.
-The car won't run.
Why won't it?
-There's a differential problem.
I hope the rear is alright.
-Yes, it is.
Then l'll drive it out of the rear.
Now please give me the keys.
Out of the rear!
What's happening?
The engine seems to have
gone kaput! The car won't run.
I wouId like to examine the car,
if you permit me, sir.
Yes. Go ahead.
One says "kaput", the
other wants an "examination"!
Wonder if they're
talking of the same car!
Living in Bombay has
spoiIt your language.
Not "spoilt" sir,
the word is "corrupted".
No .probIem sir.
The oil fiIter is secure.
The probIem is solved.
Saved us a 100 bucks
we'd have spent..
..had the car gone to a mechanic.
WhiIe on your way, drop
in once at Shrivastav's residence.
Which Shrivastav?
Prashant, the feIlow
into imports and exports.
I have a parcel to
be deIivered to him.
Sahib!..
May I proceed for
the ablution of my hand?
He's gone to wash his hands.
-l know!
WouIdn't l,
after so many years with you?
Now come in and change.
You'd said that the car won't run.
But he's repaired it.
Looks like a capable one.
Wait till he gets into an accident.
I wouId like to meet Mr. Prashant.
The barrister saheb has sent me.
That's the cabin.
Go ahead.
-Thank you, lady.
May I enter, Sahib?
-Come in.
Salaam, Sahib!
How is Mr.Raghav keeping?
-He is fine.
Are you a new recruit?
-Yes, Sahib.
Wait!
What's this! The tea..
-lt was getting cold. l had it, sir.
Put it down!
Sahib! l've already sipped from it!
III-mannered lout!
I'll caIl your employer just now!
-No! Please sahib!
I Iay my hat at your feet!
Please don't compIain!
I'll lose the job!
It's you! Rogue!
WelI? All suited and booted..
can't you even Iook at me?
What's aII this about?
-Quiet!
I hope we won't be intruded upon.
-Who can do that?
Lower your voIume!
Here's a change of cIothes.
I got saved by the skin of my neck.
James had nearIy crashed the car.
You shouId've asked
him to drive sIowly.
Pyare is a good driver.
He doesn't even step on the brakes.
Have him drive you from tomorrow.
-Where has he gone?
He has taken leave for sometime.
He has gone to buy
an English language book.
Goodness! He comes from
your part of the country.
You'd rather teach him.
Pyare regards you
as a schoIar. Not me.
Don't caII him Pyare (lover), okay?
Looks like time's up for me.
May I enter, Sahib?
-Come in.
I'm undone. Oh misery!
-What has happened?
I have spent 4 full
rupees to buy this book!
With the intention that I'd
Iearn the Ianguage with your help.
But this Ianguage is so deceptive!
NO is pronounced "No".
So aIso is KNOW pronounced.
UncIes alI of them irrespective of
whether they're paternaI or maternal!
This is unjust, Sahib.
And then again..
..irrespective of whether
one is addressing..
..an eIder or younger person..
..the word is invariabIy "you".
Pyaremohan!
-Yes, Sahib.
I've just returned from the office.
I'm very tired.
I'm getting a headache.
May I rest?
-SureIy, Sahib. You shouId rest.
There is a smaII question,
however undeserving.
Pneumonia is spent
with a 'P'. -Yes.
Pthysis is also spelt
with a 'P'. -Yes.
Why are the P's not pronounced?
-l want to rest!
Please! PIease take your rest.
The explanation can come later.
Such fooI.
How shouId I know why Pneumonia..
..and Pthysis are speIt with P's?
I didn't create
the Ianguage, did I?
No! I'd prefer the other driver,
what's that feIIow called?
James.
-Yes, he'II do. Not this feIlow.
He'II drive me mad.
At the most,
James wiII only crash the car!
Saheb..
-What is it?
You were tired yesterday.
I didn't bother you.
But explain it today.
ExpIain what?
-NO is pronounced as KNOW.
Why isn't the 'K'
pronounced, saheb?
Look Pyaremohan, perhaps, later..
-A teIegram, sir.
Saved me. Bring it.
Bring it quickIy.
Sulekha is arriving by
the 1 1 'O Clock train today.
Miss Sulekha!
It'll be fun!
What's the fun in it?
I Iike Ms Sulekha very much.
And she Iikes me a Iot too.
How do you know her?
My uncle drives for her brother.
I've been with her
aIl through her wedding.
Right from the engagement
to the first nuptial night,
I've done everything for her.
I am indispensable for her.
But I'll certainIy say that..
..not all is welI
with the marriage.
What do you mean?
-Not a good match.
He won't stand comparison with you.
It's a totaI mismatch.
What are you saying?
Dr ParimaI Tripathi, after all..
Yes. I've heard that
he's some doctor the weeds.
Okay.
WelI, what does he Iook Iike?
-He's coming today.
Why don't you take
a look for yourself?
He isn't coming today.
He's coming a few days Iater.
WelI, take a look at him Iater.
But I'll teII you something, sahib.
It'd be a well nigh impossible to..
..find as good a groom as yourself.
You're great. I haven't
adequate words to praise you.
Okay Pyaremohan.
But you mustn't say all
this in SuIekha's presence.
Never, sahib, never.
Your co-brother is as good as mine.
Now get the car out.
Ms Sulekha's coming!
I can't beIieve my ears! I can't !
I'll never forgive brother-in-law..
..for not coming to receive me.
Greetings, Ms Sulekha.
My greetings, madam.
Oh! Mr. Pyaremohan!
When did you come here?
A couple of days ago.
So, how do you find
my brother-in-Iaw?
He isn't really what
I had heard about him.
Meaning? -l'd heard he's strict and
wouId hauI me up for "mistakes".
But I don't think
he's up to catching me.
Quite a simple-hearted
and sympathetic gentleman.
How are you liking Bombay?
I haven't been Iiking it.
How couId l like it, being
so far away from people Iike you?
Now that you're here..
..l think that I might
get to like this place.
What about that doctor of weeds?
Hasn't he come?
Enough! Now move it, Pyaremohan.
You're a chatterbox.
I beg your pardon, Ma'am..
..but when the heart is
full ofjoy, l tend to chatter.
Isn't that so?
-So that is!
There you are.. Please get in.
come. Take the bags.
Welcome, sister-in-Iaw.
Oh! You've changed
a lot since marriage!
Bless you.
I won't speak to you.
-Why?
Why didn't you come to the station?
-Come in, l'll teIl you.
Ms Sulekha..
..how is my wife?
She's fine, Pyaremohan.
Does she think of me?
Maran
It's "Smaran" ("Remember")!
In Hindi, we'd ask if one thinks
(smaran) of something or someone.
Does she miss me?
She thinks a lot about you.
I think about her often too. Often!
Where did your wife spring from?
From Allahabad, Sire.
I'm not asking for the city.
How did she happen to be..
..when you are a bachelor!
What couId l do?
I'm here in Bombay.
And she is in AIIahabad.
I used to pacify myself
pretending l'm a bachelor.
Now that Ms Sulekha is here..
..l remember again,
that I am married!
Here is someone come from home. .
..My wife's home!
come along.
-Sahib!
What of the "pthysis" ?
Pthysis! Who's ill?
-l am!
I've got Pneumonia too!
She's just come. Must you
use these inauspicious words now?
I mustn't.
Not on such an auspicious occasion.
I beg your pardon, Sahib.
How's ParimaI as a person?
come on, tell me.
He's okay.
What do you mean, "Okay" ?
Okay means okay.
Now don't hide anything from me.
Is something the matter between..
Not at all.
It's just that he's a bit serious.
He doesn't like jokes
or a Iight banter.
What's the matter?
Sahib ordered that I take the car..
..to a thoroughfare near
the highest seat ofjudgment.
He awaits me from half-past three.
Now, where would that be?
-The High Court!
He'II be awaiting on
a road near the High Court.
Is that it, Pyaremohan?
-Correct.
WelI then, go on.
What is the matter now?
I have a sister-in-law too, Ma'am.
So what?
A brother-in-law would be pIeased..
..if a sister-in-Iaw picks him up.
Pyare is right! Wait, l'll come.
At least put your shoes on.
-l won't get out of the car.
In here.
-Not now. Everyone's looking.
WelI, your brother-in-law
is a smart one, is he?
I accept defeat.
-Now Iisten..
He'II be standing..
..out there. We'll go past him.
Pretend not to notice.
Must we?
-Sit inside and snuggle up to me.
How much fair?
4.50.
Here take 5 Rs.
Why the taxi?
-What else couId I do?
But Sulekha went to pick you up.
Did she go to pick me up..
..or has she gone on
a joy-ride with Pyaremohan?
I don't understand.
Have you missed the car?
I saw the car..with Pyaremohan
and Sulekha sitting in it..
..necking away
in a Iovers' embrace!
What are you saying! SuIekha
was sitting on the backseat.
I saw it with my own eyes.
So did l. Not borrowed ones!
We were sIightIy deIayed.
By then, brother-in-Iaw had Ieft.
What's the matter?
Sister.
What is the matter sister.?
Were you up front with Pyare?
Yes. But who's toId you that?
Whoever it may be!
Were you sitting with Pyare?
What couId l do? He kept
turning back to talk with me.
"How's my wife?
Does she think of me?"
I was afraid we'd have an accident.
So I sat up front.
How come you returned
to the backseat?
Pyare told me that since
we were nearing the house..
..l'd rather take the back seat.
This chap Pyaremohan isn't
exactIy a virtuous feIIow.
A look at him is enough
to infuriate your brother-in-law.
UnbeIievabIe!
I'd never imagine that
the act would go on for so long.
You've explained the plan to Kumar,
haven't you?
Don't worry about that.
I'll convince Kumar.
The only thing
I feeI bad about is..
..whiIe poking fun at a language.
And that's just what l'm
doing with my own mother-tongue.
You're not poking
fun at a language.
You're merely making
fun of someone.
The majesty of a language
can never be ridicuIed.
I must hang up now.
Or they might suspect me.
Greeting.
When are you going
to switch off the lights?
Who is coming.
I'm feeling sleepy.
What ?
-Sleepy! I'm sIeepy.
And I'm feeling..
Iike writing poetry.
Poetry?
-Yes.
I can't find the rhymes sometimes.
-What can't you find?
Rhymes, don't you know?
-No.
Let me teII you.
Like "steering" and "bearing"
Like "accelerator"
and "carburetor".
Let's hear one of your etceteras.
D'you want to Iisten?
Hear! Wait a minute..
"A rose will bIoom
in the gardens today.."
Great! Wonderful!
"A rose will bIoom
in the gardens today.."
"..Give me O bartender.."
You understand, don't you?
I do. Please go ahead.
"Give me O friend..
Give me a drink of.."
"Give me a drink of.."
-What's wrong?
This is where I'm stuck!
I can't find the rhyme.
It's fine indeed.
"Give me a drink of wine"
No, the poet Ghalib wrote that.
I'll have something else to drink.
Go ahead and recite
the coupIet again. Go on.
"A rose shalI bloom
in the gardens today.."
"Give me O friend,
give me a drink of.."
"A glass of shit"
-Great! SpIendid!
Darn ?!
What wilI you do with roses then?
It acts as manure for the roses!
Is that poetry or a
home-remedy you're suggesting!
Okay, then. Let me think.
-Yes. Go ahead and think.
You go ahead and sIeep.
I can't think with the lights on.
Go on and sleep now.
-Okay. But you must think properIy.
Don't think of the wrong
things in the darkness!
Oh no, I'II think straight.
Go to sleep.
Hey, Iisten!
-What is it?
Once you've finished with thinking,
switch on the Iights.
After that, you can go to sleep,
and I can sit up and think.
We'II take turns at thinking!
-Why not?!
We wiIl think, okay..
Go to sleep!
The audacity of a driver!
How dare you enter my quarter
at this hour of the night?
I beg your pardon.
But I couIdn't stand James
" Bond" snoring away by my side.
So, I decided to spend
the night with you cIose to you.
Forget not who you are, Pyaremohan.
Stop fooIing around, SuIekha.
You don't know how
hard it has been for me.
I'd rather call you Pyaremohan.
-Why?
Pyaremohan sounds
better than Parimal.
So she likes a driver
more than a professor?
Why? Are drivers not human beings?
Oh yes, they are.
But when a driver can get his
hands on his wife after 7 days..
..he doesn't stand
talking like this.
What does he do then?
ShaII l show you?
come.
-HelIo.
Lata, this is my sister SuIekha.
- Greeting.
She has just been
married to the famous..
..professor Parimal Tripathi.
He's a close friend of my husband.
But we couldn't attend the wedding.
Do you know him?
-No, l haven't met him yet.
This is my sister, Vasudha.
She's Mr. Parimal Tripathi's wife.
We read books written by him.
You could chat with Vasudha,
while we meet Mrs. Bakshi.
Let,s go Iata.
-Yes, sister..
And we must aIso visit
the War Widows' Association.
Oh yes l was forgot.
Let's not take the car along then.
I'll drop you on the way back.
come home, after you've
been with Sulekha for some time.
come.
When is Mr. Tripathi expected?
-ln a few days.
He'II teach me botany, won't he?
-Why not? He certainly will.
I must leave now, Vasudha.
But how can that be?
I think l'II take
a look around town.
But I'll drop in someday..
we'II have a chat then.
Drive to the Aarey Milk colony.
-Where is that, ma'am?
Start the car.. I'Il teII you.
I wilI start the car.
Why have you stopped the car here?
I haven't.
It stopped on its own.
Why? ls the engine overheated?
-No, it's cooled down.
Let it heat up while
we cool off a bit.
Let's take a breath of fresh air.
What wouId you like to have,
Iittle Ratna?
Ratna wants to have an ice-cream.
We'II get you an ice-cream.
come.
come mem, come.
I want to come too.
No, don't. The car might be stolen.
That's right.
Take care of the car.
I'll take care of your aunt.
And your aunt will take
care of your ice-cream.
Isn't that right? Come on..
We shouId do something..
..so that Ratna goes
home and tells them about it.
What do you mean?
Let's sing a song, holding hands.
Aren't you ashamed?
And you're supposed
to be a professor!
Just now, l'm mereIy a driver.
Driver.
"How do flowers bIossom in bower?"
"They bIoom when
they bees caress them."
"In the bower.."
"Why does season
of spring entice heart?"
"Everyone sings
and dances with buds."
"When buds bloom even
heart gets pleasure."
"In the bower.."
"TeII me, when does it happen.."
"Don't tease me. lt happens when.."
"..our eyes get locked."
"How do flowers bIossom in bower?"
"They bIoom when
they bees caress them."
"In the bower.."
No. Something seems to be wrong.
Sulekha comes here alone..
..and Pyaremohan is overjoyed.
They crowd over each
other in the car and now..
..now..
..they hoId hands and sing songs.
I don't like any of this.
What do you mean?
On the first day..
..when l asked her about Parimal,
she was hesitant.
And when l asked her,
she didn't repIy properly either.
And pyaremohan wasn't said..
PearI neckIace around
the neck of the monkey.
And it seems that ParimaI
may not be as good-Iooking.
The matter is.
Now it's not our generation.
Girls, these days,
fall for looks, not for virtues.
What! Are you saying that
Sulekha and the driver ..!
ExactIy! I think..
..the two of them were
thick before her marriage.
I know it doesn't sound too nice.
But I have a nose for these things.
You'd rather eat
than smeII this cake.
I've just baked it.
-lt's very tasty.
can I give a piece to Pyaremohan?
To whom?
-Pyaremohan. He loves cakes.
He was complaining yesterday that..
..he can't get good cakes here.
So you've baked the
cake especially for him!
Why! Don't you like it?
No. There's no need
of giving him anything.
Why?
What happened?
Why don't you telI
me what has happened?
Ratna toId us that you
were singing a song with Pyare.
Yes. So what?
Pyare sings weII.
You must Iisten to him sing.
-l don't want to listen to anything.
What a shame! With a driver!
What are you saying.
Are drivers not human-beings?
-They maybe.
But your husband..
You don't know my husband. l do.
Besides,
even if l have sung with Pyare..
..no one has a right to object.
WelI, all right.
We can give him the cake Iater.
Why don't you give him a piece?
-No! l'll get pthysis or pneumonia!
Does he ask you too?
-What else?
I'll fix him with
Parimal once he comes.
Pyaremohan wasn't Iike
this back in AIIahabad.
He'd never chatter away.
It's started after he's come here.
So the earthworm
of AIIahabad thinks..
..he's become a snake in Bombay.
Let ParimaI come.
I'll make an earthworm
out of him yet.
Who's it?
-lt's me, Sahib.
come in.
Mr. & Mrs. Shrivastav P.K. Are here.
The fair, short fellow?
-Yes, ma'am.
Goodness,
when did he take to drink?
Who told you that he's drunk?
-He himseIf toId me so.
Did he say that "I've arrived drunk"?
He asked me to tell you that P.K.
Shrivastav has come.
There's P.K.
For you. Prashant Kumar!
Now the question is
whether you shall descend..
..or must they ascend?
For God's sake please!
And..
-Ok.
How can you stand the pristine
purity of the language?
He's from your part of the country.
It's you who insisted on purity.
Purity of Ianguage, yes.
But I never bargained for a madman.
Welcome, Prashant!
You had to wait
downstairs for Iong.
Doesn't matter.
You must be ParimaI's wife,
Sulekha! Greetings!
I'm Prashant. And you must
be acquainted with my wife.
come sit.
And have a cake SuIekha has baked.
I'll eat the cake and
have a song too, SuIekha.
Parimal has already
told me that you sing weII.
No, not today..
Perhaps some other day.
Don't act pricey, sis-in-Iaw..
Sing a song for us!
Go on, SuIekha..
Sit down, Lata.
Which song do l sing?
-Anything you feel Iike.
Start!
"In this season of bloom.."
"In this season of bloom..
heart will pine."
"cIouds wilI shower
but two hearts can't unite."
"In this season of bloom..
heart will pine."
"cIouds wilI shower
but two hearts can't unite."
"In this season of bloom.."
What do you think, Prashant?
-She's very good.
"There is a hurdle
between two hearts.."
"How can l hear the caII of Iove?"
"No matter how much u try.."
"..but two hearts can't unite."
"In this season of bloom.."
"There isn't a casement
in this big house."
"How can we deceive the world?"
"This breeze will make
me stay awake aIl night."
"..but two hearts can't unite."
"In this season of bloom.."
"This wiII be a bad
year for our love."
"When it blooms,
we'II be in a bad state."
"This garden will
spread thorn for us."
"..but two hearts can't unite."
Who's there?
-lt's me, Sir. Pyaremohan.
What are you doing
standing over there?
I've just come and
I'm standing here.
come on in.
come over here!
Why did you say "Coming" twice?
When you used "Standing" twice,
I Iiked it very much!
So I too used the
word twice to enjoy..
..the pleasure of the rhyme.
Which means that you henceforth
speak onIy in rhymes!
If you permit me, sir.
-Not at aII!
You're mad, Pyaremohan.
No, sir. I'm not mad anymore.
What do you mean "not anymore"?
Were you mad earlier?
PeopIe used to joke about it.
But I don't think I was ever mad.
How Iong back was this?
Go on..teII me?
I'm ashamed to speak of it.
-Drop the act and teII me!
It was before my marriage.
But after I've been married,
no one says..
..that l've shown
any signs of madness.
They're wrong.
You show all the signs of madness.
What signs?
-First of aII, you taIk too much.
That is a fault with me.
But the moon is flawed too.
Any other signs?
You speak too refined a tongue.
I do, to pIease you.
It's madness to think that
such madness will pIease me.
Understand?
I've got into troubIe
by listening to you.
You told me this
afternoon that the..
..Sahib is pIeased
with my language.
Whenever did I tell you anything?
This is the first
time I've seen you.
Not you, Mrs. Shrivastav.
I'm speaking to Ms Sulekha.
But why are you looking at me?
Not you, Madam.
I'm Iooking at Mrs. Srivastav.
Oh, I know what irks
these peopIe Mr. Srivastav.
It's just that I have a squint.
A bit towards the right.
-Towards the right!
can you see me?
-No, sir. I can only see your ear.
And now?
-Yes, l see you cIearIy.
Till yesterday you were fine.
How have you gone
squint alI of a sudden?
I've never Iooked you in the eye.
You're my empIoyer.
I cannot stare into your face.
Whenever you'd thought
I was Iooking at you..
..l'd actuaIIy been
eyeing someone else.
I don't know for sure
if you're squint or straight.
But I'm sure that
you're a compIicated one.
Today you're squint.
Tomorrow you couId turn
Iame or start stuttering.
I'm speaking normaIIy.
How couId l start
stuttering all of a sudden?
If you couId turn squint,
you could stammer too.
I beg your pardon,
but there is a Iimit to everything.
There aren't any limits as
far as you are concerned. Get out!
You're insulting me
because I'm a poor man!
Do it.
Mr. Haripad treats
me like a family member.
Why, Ms Sulekha! You must've
seen how much he Ioves me.
Had I known that I'd be
denied that love and respect..
..l wouldn't have come here at all.
Where did you get
this comedian from?
My brother-in-Iaw has sent
him with a cart-Ioad of references.
Which is why I can't throw him out.
Neither can l bear
with him anymore.
What a strange fix I'm in!
What can l do with such a madman!
Have you come?
I've been waiting for you so Iong.
come and sit here.
Now don't tease me.
Where are you?
Why you have come barefoot?
Why are you hiding?
You haven't even shut the door!
Who are you?
-A thief!
Thief! Come out!
Why have you come here?
-To steal.
How did you come here?
-l climbed up the water pipes.
Weren't you scared?
Oh no! It's an everyday matter.
Let's wake up the household
and hand him over to the poIice.
No, if we call police..
Your brother-in-law
will get to know.
I'd have to go back to the garage.
No. You'd rather stay here.
I'll be on my way.
But how will you go?
-l'll cIimb down the pipes.
No. You could slip and faIl down.
come, l'II show you the way.
But, if you get caught,
I'll kiII you!
Don't you worry, friend!
Wish you all the luck!
-Shut up! Wishing me luck!
Here, take this.
It's yours. Keep it. Go on.
The door downstairs is open.
Go through it.
Friend! -What is it?
It's aII a matter of Iuck really!
-What?
You're a bIoody thief!
I'm a bloody thief as weII!
You've got the girI waiting
for you. You're going to have fun!
I'm the one who has to
go away with my pockets empty.
can you spare a tenner?
-Rogue! Quiet! Quiet!
WelI, all right.
Please get out of here! PIease!
What's the significance of the 'P'?
If there's anyone
in this househoId..
..whose name starts with a 'P'..
-lt's..Pyaremohan.
Do you understand it now?
No, I don't.
So what if it beIongs to him?
Do you know where
I picked it up from?
Where?
It was lying right
outside your sister's room.
And how did it reach there?
-l don't know.
But I did see Pyaremohan
tiptoeing out of there.
My God!
-We are doomed!
What are we to do?
It's going to be a scandaI.
And Parimal is going
to be here in a few days.
You must find a way out of this.
Have you called me Sahib?
-Yes. Come in.
How did this come here?
Where did you find it?
Don't ask me questions.
Just answer mine.
What questions?
-Get rid of your toothbrush first.
You've confessed that
this handkerchief is yours.
Now tell me how it has
reached the verandah upstairs.
There! This luckIess piece
had to faII there, of all pIaces!
What have you been
doing in the verandah?
I had just passed
over the verandah.
And where had you been?
To that room in front of which..
..this bloody kerchief was found!
So you had been to Sulekha's room,
have you?
What business have you there?
Please don't ask! I can't tell you!
Oh yes, you wiII. You certainly
will. I'll caII the poIice.
Please don't. There'd be a scandaI.
Going to police station.
It's not good thing.
Then tell me cIearly..
What you were doing there!
Very well.
If l teII
Ever after l got married,
I can't spend nights alone.
I miss my wife. Just think of it.
You're newly married
and have to spend..
..the nights hearing James snore!
When l couldn't bear it anymore,
I went to Ms SuIekha..
..to consuIt her on whether
I must resign the job.
And you had gone there at 12
in the night to ask this question!
Not twelve.
It was a quarter to twelve.
At 1 1 .30, James started snoring.
I bore with him for 15 minutes.
After that, l couIdn't stand it.
-You are fined 5 rupees for..
..for your indignant behavior.
-Very welI. You are the boss.
Here. Take this
and give me a receipt.
Keep it. It'Il be
deducted from your salary.
I want my salary in full.
It doesn't matter
if l am fined 10 times.
Stop talking gibberish.
And get out of here.
Very well. l'll have it maiIed.
-Get out of here!
What's the matter?
Brother-in-law is very
agitated..and so are you!
Is it because Pyare had
come to my room last night?
Aren't you ashamed?
Why did he go to your room?
That's what brother-in-Iaw
is asking Pyare.
Why don't you ask him?
-l'm asking you. -I won't telI you.
Why won't you?
-What's going on?
Good of you to have come.
Will you teIl sister
what transpired last night?
You know of it from Pyaremohan.
She's dying to hear of it.
If Pyare disturbed you last night..
..you shouId've informed
us this morning.
I couId ask you the same.
ShouIdn't you have spoken to me once
before interrogating Pyaremohan?
I didn't ask you because..it
wouIdn't have been decent of me.
And I didn't teII you
because it was insignificant.
Insignificant!
A servant steaIs into your
room at night! lnsignificant!
He may have come stealthily,
but not to steaI!
It might be fooIish on his part,
not dishonorabIe.
You're making mountains
out of moIehiIIs.
Mountains indeed! NevertheIess,
we don't Iike aII this.
What if ParimaI gets to know..?
-He has seen me and Pyaremohan.
He has seen us sing together.
Do as you wish when ParimaI's here.
But tiIl he arrives,
I won't permit this.
What a scandaI! SuIekha!
-What's wrong with her?
"Dear sister..
..l would be far away by
the time you receive this Ietter"
"There's no particular
reason why l've left."
"It's just that l feIt like"
"I'II be back in a few days.
Yours with love. SuIekha"
"P.S.: I wish there had not been
this furore over Pyaremohan"
What a shame!
How couId she do this?
Do something fast!
God knows where she has gone!
Have patience. Let me see.
come in. -There was
a letter in the mailbox.
Who's the letter from?
-From Pyaremohan.
"Respected Sahib,
please accept my greetings"
"l was touched when
I saw Ms Sulekha..'
'..leaving the house this morning"
"l asked for her reason,
but she would not speak of it"
'Nor did she teII
me of her desti-Nation.
So I chose to go along too"
"It's not safe for her
to travel aIone these days"
"At the end of herjourney..
..l wiII meet you
with news of her"
'Good-bye tilI then"
"PIease deduct 5 rupees
from my Iast saIary..'
..which I will
collect on returning"
"PIease pray to God
for our safe passage"
Yours humbly,
Pyaremohan AIIahabadi"
Thank God she's not alone.
I hope she does not fall in danger.
The "danger" is traveIIing with her!
She needn't faII into it anymore!
What'll we do if she doesn't return
by the time Parimal arrives?
come, let's go to the
station and take a look.
A teIegram has come.
-Show me.
Show you?
I couId read it out instead.
Show it to me!
It must've come from AIIahabad.
-lt has!
God! l hope ParimaI isn't coming!
He is! Today! With Haripad!
What are we going to teII them?
-What else can l say?
I'll teII him straight that his
wife has eIoped with the driver.
Why shouId I be afraid?
She hasn't eloped with me, has she!
Stop crying! Let's do something!
Let's elope too!
The servants wiIl teII
them there's no one in!
You'd stiII be sitting here..
..planning your escapades,
when they arrive!
There! They must have arrived.
I received a caII Iast night
from a friend who said that..
..Parimal and Haripad are
arriving by train at 1 1 .20 today.
Telegrams can't be trusted,
you see.
So he got them to call me up.
Have you received any news?
I have just received a telegram.
And, earlier on this morning,
I received some bad news.
What? -You're Iike famiIy.
I can tell you.
Besides, you're Parimal's friend.
Maybe, you can find a way out.
But what has happened?
-What had to happen has happened!
Sulekha has gone away
somewhere without informing us.
What are you saying?
Bombay's dangerous for a lone girI.
She's not alone.
Pyaremohan is accompanying her.
That driver!..
Has he left without informing too?
Sulekha and that driver
have Ieft together!
Without informing you!
TroubIe! ParimaI is
a very sensitive person!
A sensitive person!
You can taIk in Hindi.
He would be deeply offended.
-He's a good friend of yours.
Why don't you expIain
the situation to him?
How can I expIain this?
-Do what you can.
But, please keep him calm
till SuIekha returns.
I'll do what I can.
Now, Iet's to go the station.
No, no. I won't go.
I'm quite apprehensive.
Then Iet the two of us go over.
-l..er..welI.
What am I afraid of?!
-WilI you go dressed like this?
You'd rather change your clothes.
I'm Iucky that I'm
still wearing something.
Your sister has stripped
me off my prestige.
come!
We've arrived.
-Are you nervous?
You don't seem to understand.
Parimal is a professor of botany.
WhiIe l don't know 'B' of Botany.
If someone asks me..
..why butterflies sit on fIowers,
what am I going to answer?
You're going to "your" in-laws.
Not into a classroom.
That's another probIem. -How can
I ever bring myself to address..
..my sister-in-Iaw as my wife!
-You must be forgetting that..
..Parimal and Sulekha aren't there.
They've eIoped.
Oh yes! -It's only
a matter of a few days.
Prashant will certainIy be there.
He'II take you to his house.
Will he?
-He certainIy wiII. -Ok.
Looks like the train has arrived.
Let's go in to receive them.
No. I won't come with you.
I'm still in a quandary
over what l'm going to teIl them.
There! There they are!
-This is the end of it!
Sorry, we're a bit late.
Hope you had a comfortable journey.
Parimal, meet Raghav.
-l seek your blessings, Sir.
God bless you.
-Hope everything is fine at home.
WelI, just about.
-Hasn't Sulekha come?
She isn't here.
She has gone somewhere else.
Somewhere else!
She knows weII that l'm coming!
And she goes eIsewhere!
When did she Ieave? When!
-This morning itself.
Has she gone aIone?
-Er, no..Pyaremohan is with her.
What Pyaremohan?!
-The driver he sent from Allahabad.
Isn't he that same Pyaremohan who..
..was there during our marriage?
Who seemed to be
intimate with Sulekha?
That smart, fair fellow.
Isn't he the one?
Porter! Take my luggage
to the Waiting Room !
I'm Ieaving for Patna.
Where are you off to, ParimaI?
come back.
I don't want to go
where l don't belong.
What are you saying!
We are your in-Iaws.
My house is yours.
What am I without a wife?
I'm not even myseIf!
In-laws for a widow!
-Not a widow! Widower!
Yes.
You can't walk away just Iike that!
You'd perhaps know who l am!
-Why not?
You're ParimaI, my friend.
And I don't like to go
to pIaces where l am unwelcome.
But you can certainIy come
to a friend's pIace, can't you?
I won't let you go away
in this manner. Come to my pIace.
What do you peopIe think?
-As you feel fit.
Please don't misunderstand me.
I'm helpless.
I can understand your heIplessness.
You cannot understand.
I'm very.. oh! So utterly helpIess.
Let's go Prashant.
-Come.
Let's take a cab.
-Porter, stow the luggage.
What's happening, Raghav?
It's aII your doing! I'll teII
you aII about it at home. Let's go.
You've got yourseIf a nice house.
Now, who am I?
-Prashant.
I'm one of your closest friends.
Stop being formal!
Your wife has eIoped with a driver.
-My wife!
Parimal's wife has!
And you're ParimaI!
Your wife has eIoped this morning.
But you seem to
be in a jovial mood.
Go around with a gIoomy face.
Like that!
Now Iet me chat up my wife
and my sister-in-law to build up..
..a sympathetic atmosphere for you.
What do you mean?
-They'll ask me why you have..
..chosen to stay here.
I'll teII them that..
..the poor fellow's
wife has run away!
The Iadies will express shock!
They'Il take good care of you.
WelI then,
be on your way, Prashant.
But don't you smiIe.
You shouId puII the
Iong face Parimal would do.
Get the luggage from the cab!
Why! Hasn't ParimaI come?
-He went away to Prashant's house.
None of this would've happened
had you not sent Pyaremohan.
Please find out something
about SuIekha's whereabouts.
ShouId I go to the police?
-What would peopIe say of it then?
Then, let's sit quietIy.
No, you mustn't
You're a friend of brother-in-Iaw.
Brother-in-law! Who?
-Prashant is my brother-in-law.
Yes. Prashant! He's a close
friend of mine. Please be seated.
And, what do you do?
-l'm studying in coIIege.
And what is your subject
of study? -Botany.
What was it, you said?
-Botany.
You'II heIp me with a few lessons,
won't you?
Why not? Certainly!
It's Botany, after aII.
can I have a cup of tea?
-Why, of course!
How's it going?
-Can't I stay at some hotel?
Why? -Your sister-in-law
is a student of botany.
I've heard it aII.
Why did you have to..
..ask her questions
about her studies?
Didn't I teIl you to sit
around quietly with a glum face?
WelI, now it seems that I'm
destined for a Iifetime of gloom.
Greetings.
Parimal, this is my wife Lata.
You're a friend of my husband.
-And you're like a brother to me.
I won't have you sitting
around with a gIoomy face.
You don't seem to understand.
If l'm not gloomy,
peopIe take it otherwise.
It was a problem just now.
-What? -Oh, it's nothing reaIIy.
Why don't you get
a cup of tea for Parimal?
Watch your step, ParimaI.
I'll be leaving for the day.
If you need anything, just
ask my wife or my sister-in-law.
No! Not your sister-in-law!
I'd rather talk to your wife!
can you turn a fan on or something?
Why are you getting nervous, Kumar?
-No, not nervous.
I'll return after meeting
Mr. Raghav.
can't you go Iater?
-Why do you worry?
Just be carefuI of Vasudha.
-Who's Vasudha?
The one who came to you for botany.
-The sister-in-Iaw!
Not yours! Mine! Sister-in-law!
-Yes, the sister-in-law!
Tea. -That was quick.
The tea, I mean.
You'II teach me Botany, won't you?
certainly!
You sing well, don't you?
My brother-in-Iaw
must have told you that.
Don't worry. I won't bore you.
Don't you say!
Music is a very nice thing.
You must sing a song.
I wilI, if you give
me a few Iessons in Botany.
A beautifuI girI Iike you shouId've
taken up Literature not Botany.
Botany may be difficult,
but it's interesting, nevertheIess.
Look at literature.
It's not difficuIt. It's interesting too.
You write books on Botany and
advocate the cause of literature.
What l mean to say is that the
apparent truth may not be true..
..and that which may not
be apparent, may yet be true!
I understand. You're looking
for excuses to avoid teaching me.
It's foolish of me, really.
I'm not in your Ieague.
Why are you people Iooking sad?
-Should we be celebrating?
If not celebration at
Ieast get into a conversation.
come!
Please don't worry about Parimal.
I'll see that he comes to meet you.
No, no. If he comes here,
I'll run away to your place.
Will you not pIay host
to your brother-in-Iaw?
Till such time that
Sulekha does not come back!
What if SuIekha
doesn't return at aII?
She'II sureIy return.
-She may have gone away with Pyare.
Don't even mention that rogue!
How's Pyaremohan at fault?
-Don't you take his side!
I've yet to see a worse scoundrel!
I shaII be moving. -Yes.
Vasudha must be aIone at home.
No, she isn't aII alone.
She must be catching
up on Botany with Parimal.
come. Sit down.
I'm very weak in Botany.
Please heIp me out, won't you?
certainly! Certainly!
-Thank you.
Are you weak in Botany or
are you weak in other subjects too?
It's only Botany.
Then you shouId
have stressed on it.
By the way, what are your other
subjects? -EngIish, for instance?
What have you been taught?
-Julius caesar.
I know it by heart.
Please teach me Botany.
Tell me, what are the
functions of a CoroIIa?
KareIa..
KareIa
KareIa (bitter-gourd) is very bitter
to taste but good for the Iiver.
You're making fun of it.
I'm asking about the Corolla,
not the Karela.
When are your exams?
You so much time.
Till then everything will be fine.
Don't worry then. You'II pass it.
I'm not disturbing you, am I?
I Iike your company.
I Iike to speak to you too.
You're weIcome to ask questions..
..not only on Botany,
but on other subjects too.
Sorry to have Ieft you alone.
I'm not aIone. Vasudha is here.
You mustn't be formal with me.
I hope Vasudha hasn't
been disturbing you.
I was teaching her Botany.
Parimal,
we've to go and meet Mr. Chopra.
WelI, did he teach you anything?
-He's a joIIy good feIlow.
I've begun to Iike him too.
God knows why SuIekha
did such a thing.
Kumar is in a bad fix.
For you it's a matter
of entertain-Ment.
No one even thinks about me.
I tried to divert
her to JuIius caesar.
But she heId on to coroIIa.
What's worse for me are
these spectacles of yours.
That's the onIy scoring
point you have, Kumar.
Now, what news of the
genius brother-in-law?
He's in a sorry state.
I suggest you forgive
his ingeniousness now.
No. It's not yet time.
In a coupIe of days,
another act between..
..Sukumar and Vasudha cIimaxes.
-No!
I'd rather tell her
than go on teaching Botany.
Relax. You must have patience.
cupid makes you wait.
-For Venus.
All you have to do is buy a botany
text-book..
..burn the midnight oil over it.
SpilI it out the next
morning and you're the hero.
"O' breeze, bIow steaIthily."
"cupid plays flute."
"There is love in the air."
"O' breeze, bIow steaIthily."
"How can l teII this breeze.."
"..not to Iift the veil of damsel."
"Don't kindIe the desire in heart."
"O' breeze, bIow steaIthily."
"How can anyone hold
silence at such times?"
"Sometime has tied beIIs
on the legs of dancer."
"The heart too dances with joy."
"O' breeze, bIow steaIthily."
I've aIready studied
the coroIIa last night.
I studied it!
-Oh, have you aIready!
Will you teIl me why
is a MarigoId not a fIower?
What did you said?
Please repeat it.
Why is a Marigold not a fIower?
The caulifIower is not a fIower.
So aIso a marigold isn't a flower.
-You're pulling my Ieg.
Yesterday,
the coroIIa turned KareIa
And now, Marigold is Cauliflower.
That's just the point.
That which is apparent isn't true!
And how can a truth not be so?
The Iobster isn't a fish.
And a sweet made
out of miIk isn't miIk.
Your brother-in-law has
come to meet you, ParimaI.
Why? WeII, where is he?
-Sitting inside.
Ok.
He's a strange one.
Will you have some breakfast?
-No thank you.
I don't feeI hungry.
I'll just have a cup of tea.
Greetings..
-Greetings.
Be seated.. how are you?
-l'm okay.
Hasn't Haripad come along too?
-He must still be asIeep.
Any Ietter from Sulekha yet?
-No.
Where do you think she's gone?
She Ieft without informing us.
-How couId she inform you?
After all,
she was going away with Pyaremohan.
It's really not that serious.
-And how can it not be?
Don't you know that
she knew Pyare-..
..Mohan even before our marriage?
I didn't know. l didn't.
-WeII, at Ieast you know now.
Had I known it,
I'd never had married her.
Please don't say these things.
-What else must l say then?
Matters must be decided
once and for aII.
What sort of a decision?
-Regarding the marriage.
I'll think of it when the
time comes. Now, I'II be moving.
I'm giving Botany
Iessons to Vasudha.
Vasudha is a very good girl.
One in a million!
She must be waiting for me.
Now where is he?
What had you been so early ?
-To meet Parimal.
Which ParimaI?
-There is the one and onIy.
couIdn't you find
anyone eIse for the girl?
You seem to be in a rage!
-Parimal isn't a gentIeman.
Sulekha might be at fauIt.
But he doesn't seem to be affected.
He said something
I didn't quite appreciate.
What did he say?
-He didn't express himseIf fuIIy.
But I'm sharp with words.
There seems to be
something brewing up there.
What are you saying!
-The truth!
He's been teaching Vasudha..
It's been 5 days.
And not a singIe lesson in Botany.
Why do you threaten me with Botany?
What's with Botany?
It's very simpIe.
-No, it isn't.
It may be easy for you.
But it's very difficuIt for me.
What's so difficult?
-Here, take a look.
A potato is a modified stem while
a sweet potato is a modified root!
Things apparent may not be true.
Understood?
Not a word.
It's a deep-rooted philosophy..
Like that modified root.
You speak of it as if you've
heard of it for the first time.
He's a bit too frivoIous.
I don't like it.
Why don't you like it?
He doesn't look like one
whose wife has just eloped.
And I don't like his roaming
about in the garden with Vasudha.
Botany can't be taught indoors.
You must teach Botany in a garden.
He's an eminent professor.
He must be teaching
her some fieldwork.
I am innocent,
yet weighed down by circumstances.
You couldn't find such a character
even in literature!
I can't speak
my heart to the one l desire.
And I can't have desire
for the one l speak to.
You cannot understand
my compuIsions, Vasudha.
Sulekha might aIso have
been forced by her circumstances.
The troubIe is, your heart
fills with Iove for SuIekha..
..but not for me!
Not Iove. No, not even sympathy.
You have not cared for my heart.
Not my name, Vasudha. My heart.
I'm not the right person
for comments about SuIekha.
And, what if
I have to speak of you?
About me?
-Yes. l think of you day and night.
And I feeI so deeply for you.
You're the onIy one l can telI.
How can I say that to your sister?
-Mr. Tripathi!
I don't like you saying that.
Sulekha is Iike a sister to me.
She's mine, too.
Oh well, never mind!
I don't want your
help in my studies.
Go and sit outside, Chhotu.
A gentleman wiIl be here soon.
He's so taIl..
Just Iet him in.. not anybody eIse.
Is the act heating up?
-Steaming! lf I may say so.
And that barrister
is brewing in the pot.
His only sister-in-law has
eIoped with a two-penny driver!
Two-penny, is he?
When l had caIIed
you this morning..
..Kumar answered the phone..
..and asked me to meet
him here at 8'O Clock.
What's it about?
There he is.
Welcome, Mr. ParimaI.
I'm sick of this charade.
I want a final decision.
Why, what's up?
That which should have
happened isn't happening.
And that which shouldn't
have happened is!
What you don't try to
understand is, sometimes..
..that which is not implied,
happens too!
And that which is not implied,
happens sometimes..!
Er..just a minute.
Kumar..I think you'd
rather let it lie.
Listen to me first.
I go to teach Vasudha as you!
Not myseIf.
And she thinks it's
you who's speaking to her.
I'm the one who says it.
But the you in me,
and the me in you..
What's this you-and-l
piece all about?
You peopIe have messed
it all up for me.
I'm Sukumar, am I not?
-Yes.
But over there l'm ParimaI,right?
-Yes.
And Parimal is a married
man for Vasudha, am l not?
Not "am l" , but "he is".
-WeII, isn't he?
Yes.
-When l speak my heart out..
..she thinks it's the
married fool, ParimaI!
I mean, she thinks it's ParimaI,
a married man speaking.
And she thinks that
I'm characterless!
She's even started hating me.
And I won't toIerate this!
I Iove her..and she thinks..
No, I won't say anything.
So why don't you admit that you're
spoiIing the broth for your love!
Am I not to speak my heart?
-No!
You've no right to bring
in matters of your heart.
You're simply an
actor in this pIay.
You must do just
what the director says.
What do you say, ParimaI?
That's true.
An actor is the director's puppet.
I'm no actor. You peopIe
can do what acting you want.
I'll go and telI
her aII about this.
Yes, I'll teII her everything.
Who you are! Who I am! And you..
I'll teII her who you are too!
Who l am?! l'm Prashant!
-What's wrong with telIing her that?
I wilI, be it just for safety sake.
Don't spoil the drama
in the climax, Kumar.
Listen, Kumar.
Just continue pIaying your part.
If not an award,
you'II sureIy get a reward.
And when the cIimax unfolds..
..Vasudha will
understand everything!
Will she understand?
-Yes.
Do you promise that?
-Yes.
Are you sure?
-Yes.
What's the matter?
Why are you going away?
I have some work.
Why are you trying to avoid me?
I'm not trying
to do any such thing.
You're misunderstanding me.
I came this morning to meet you.
And you're going away.
My bad-luck.
Am I misunderstanding you?
Is it proper to try and seduce a
girl even after one is married?
I'm not what you take me for.
I thought you are a gentIeman.
-You're wrong!
No! I mean, l'm a gentleman. But..
I respected you.
But you've forced me to hate you,
Professor Tripathi.
You don't understand me, do you?
-l want to understand nothing!
Till such time that
Sulekha doesn't come here..
..don't even try to speak to me!
Listen!
Won't you even speak to me!
No. Nor do l want to see your face.
The situation is deteriorating!
I must spiII the beans!
Yes.
come. Sit here.
Even l'm waiting for SuIekha-didi
Are you referring
to her as a sister?
I'd rather address her as Bhabhi.
Prof. Tripathi is
Iike an elder brother.
Yes! Professor Tripathi,
aIias Pyaremohan!
The one who has eIoped
with his wife, Sulekha.
And who are you?
-l'm a professor of EngIish..
..Sukumar Sinha..and l don't
even know the 'B' of botany!
And I know that you're Vasudha.
And aIso that both
of us are unmarried!
What's aII this you're saying?
The truth! But don't teII anyone!
I'd thought Prof.
Tripathi would be a serious person.
But he seems to be
quite a coIorfuI one.
How did you presume that
aIl professors are serious?
I'm a professor, too, and l..
-No. You're very coIorfuI.
But I'm quite genuine!
And I'm not acting this out.
And that's why l've
told you everything.
can I give you a flower?
What happened?
-Nothing! You must study!
Flower, big and smaII..
What are we to do now?
My sister wouId suspect us.
Let's go somewhere else.
Where were you all this time?
-At the AgricuIturaI Farm.
What were you doing alI this time?
-l was studying Botany.
So late..
It was a very lengthy Iesson.
He started it this morning.
But it never seemed to end.
Whose ring is this?
-l got it in the garden.
Did you find it Iying around?
-He gave it to me.
Who's "he" ?
Your husband's friend.
can't you even utter his name!
Show me the ring.
Why is 'S' carved on it?
It's a Ietter from my name,
Vasudha.
It's the "S"
-You're a jerk.
It's the "S" of Sulekha,
that he has given to you.
Why do you mention SuIekha?
How am I related to Sulekha?
She has gone away with
the one who is related to her.
Now, l share a sacred
relationship with Vasudha.
Give us your bIessings.
Get out of my pIace,
Mr.ParimaI. lmmediately!
We'd be gIad to leave
with your blessings.
Will you get out of here,
or won't you?
Very well. lf you insist!
You don't understand
anything, do you?
Now go to your room quietly,
or eIse, I'II break your legs!
Take this and write
a letter quickly!
Write what l say?
What wilI the menu be like today?
Prepare anything you wish.
-Won't you name something?
Mr. ParimaI likes mashed brinjaIs,
must l prepare that?
No! Nobody's going to make
those mashed brinjaIs again, okay?
Give it to me.
Now go down the back stairs.
Sukumar is waiting for you.
What about my sister?
-Her act is being drawn up!
Go!
What's up?
-She's gone! Look here!
"I'm going to him.
We're getting married
tomorrow at the temple"
"PIease come to the temple
to give us your blessings"
Yours, Vasudha"
-Oh, God!
This is too much. -I wonder what
my sister must be going through.
Neither do l like this.
Let's go and teIl her all about it.
Everything wiII be aIright
by tomorrow morning. caIm down!
Seems you're worried
about your sisters only.
Poor brother-in-law!
Now, about the chores tomorrow.
Prashant, you must carry
the news of Sukumar..er..Parimal..
..to my brother-in-Iaw.
Not me! He'd beat me up.
I'll send Lata.
She'II look genuine enough.
What's more,
she's been starving herseIf!
Good. Then you must
attend the temple.
Parimal and SuIekha
are to go to Aarey colony.
I'll send James there
on one pretext or the other.
And James wiII present
you before Mr. Raghav.
Tomorrow morning at the Aarey
colony then.. at 9, remember.
come quickly, James is here.
Who are you looking for?
-A bIoody driver..
..who has eloped with the boss'
sister-in-Iaw. -He's a scoundrel!
Rather a colorful one.
-l'll paint him over, if l find him!
A gentleman in disguise, eh?
I'll teach you a Iesson!
Where are you going?
-Oh, l beg of you! Forgive me!
Open your eyes at least.
-l won't unless you forgive me.
Okay. You're forgiven.
-Have you? Thank you.
Please do something.
Please save my honor.
My mother left Vasudha in my care..
And asked me to look after her!
You shouIdn't have
given her such a long rope!
Stop this marriage somehow.
You're a barrister.
You can find a way.
I couId advise peopIe how
to get into such litigation's.
But I don't know how
to stop this marriage.
As I promised you, I'm here.
We're fine. How are you, Sahib?
Get out! Get out of here!
Please don't get excited.
It's bad for your heaIth.
Is your stammering a new ploy?
-OnIy when in anger.
And I also speak
Urdu with a stammer.
I'll stop your speech altogether!
Why are you getting so serious?
Where were you all these days?
-Let's have stories Iater.
Let's take her to the temple.
-Why?
Parimal is getting married.
-With Vasudha.
No! That can't be!
Please save my marriage
Please take me to him.
I beg of you!
I swear it! l'm innocent!
Let's hurry, Raghav.
Which car, Sahib?
The Fiat or the Mercedes?
Don't you dare touch any
of my cars! Get out! Get out!
Please let him come along.
If he isn't there..
..l won't be abIe
to prove my innocence.
She's right, let's take him along.
-All right. Let's go!
You'd rather wear it, sir.
The marriage has been soIemnized.
Here they come!
You couldn't wait for me!
I'd gone away only for a few days.
Is this your love for me?
I knew that you'd grace
this auspicious occasion.
The marriage has been soIemnized.
-What's to become of me?!
You shouIdn't cry on
such auspicious occasions.
Rubbing salt to wounds, are you?
What're you saying? SaIt is scarce!
I'll send you to jail
on charges of bigamy.
Where are you off to, priest?
-Why? What have I done?
You've married!
-l swear I haven't! I'm a bacheIor!
Not you! You've married them off.
Now you must undo the marriage.
What are you saying? Is
marriage a ghost to be exorcised?
What do you think?
-l'll undo it, by force, too!
The fault is reaIIy Pyaremohan's.
This rogue is responsibIe.
And you're letting him off!
Not 'Rascal'. -You shouId
rather calI me 'Badmash' in Hindi.
I never mix Hindi with English.
Prashant is right.
You're the main cuIprit!
Please spare my Pyare!
So your sympathies are
still with him, are they!
He sympathizes with me, after all.
Take her away!
You must die today, Pyaremohan,
so that ParimaI may Iive.
Understand? -Now, you're
at liberty to choose your death.
I have but one wish.
That l die at the hands
of the genius brother-in-Iaw.
certainly. You die at my hands!
-By way of my ear?
By marrying SuIekha!
-What's that? Have you gone mad?
This is the onIy way to kiII
Pyaremohan. Don't you understand?
This is the reaI Parimal.
And that is the fake one.
I'm Sukumar Sinha. This is Vasudha.
We've just got married.
I see. And did you
know of it all the while?
Had I not been standing inside
a temple, I might've said yes.
Why don't you sit down and say it?
-Shut up! You've fooled me enough!
I beg your pardon.
You've borne a lot
of trouble because of me.
Sulekha had praised him so much,
that I had become jealous.
Didn't you have a nose for people,
brother-in-Iaw?
I might have smelt it,
but for a bad cold up my nose.
Believe me folks,
the cold had fogged my brains too.
I've taken what insuIt I had to,
at this age.
But pIease don't teII others
that I've made a jerk of myseIf.
Namaste (Greetings).
