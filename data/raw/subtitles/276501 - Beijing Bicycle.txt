How old are you?
Nineteen.
Where're you from?
Shanxi.
Where in Shangxi?
Xiyang.
Where?
Xiyang.
Umm, Hebei...
What do you do back home?
Farmed...
worked in the office.
Host.
What?
Host.
Host what?
Program host.
How long in Beijing?
A month.
I came September
of last year.
What'd you been
doing in Beijing?
- What?
- Uh... construction.
Construction, farming... work.
Medical equipment.
Can you ride a bike?
Yes.
Your name?
Guo Lian-guei.
Express delivery?
Yes.
Don't know.
No sure.
How much you
earn a month?
A few hundred,
almost a thousand.
How much?
5, 6, 7, 8 hundred.
Starting today,
you're an employee
of Fei Da Express Delivery.
We bathed you
and cut your hair.
'Cause we want to change
your image.
So that you country kids
can blend in
and represent our company.
Your image is our image.
You must treasure
this opportunity.
The bikes we gave you
are your livelihood.
These are upscale
mountain bikes.
You may not have ever
seen them before.
We gave you such good bikes
for a good company image
and to ensure your efficiency.
So we can compete
with other companies.
But let me say this first.
This bike is not a gift.
When you start,
we split 80:20 with you.
We get 80%, you get 20%.
When you earn enough money,
the bike is yours.
After that, we go 50:50.
This is a new
management approach.
Understand?
That's a map of Beijing.
Memorize every street.
Every road.
Starting today, you're
the modern Rickshaw Boys.
Work hard!
Hey, what's this?
They hired you?
Yeah.
No bad! Let me look.
Listen to this.
What kind of material is this?
Waterproof!
You got a great job, Guei!
Work hard.
It's got different speeds.
Must be an easy ride.
Hungry?
Yeah.
Noodles!
Eat inside.
Have some meat.
It's nutritious.
Come take a look.
This is city folk.
Not happy with a big house.
Never a smiling face.
If it's me, I'd eat
dessert soup everyday.
Look, she's wearing
another dress.
Qiu, isn't she pretty?
Not against the law
to look, is it?
You know her?
She comes for soy sauce
all the time.
You see that, Guei?
A city girl!
A big pile of clothes.
So wasteful!
Stop looking.
It's not good
for your health.
Go to work.
Guei, when does the bike
become yours?
In three more days, max.
You son-of-gun!
It's been only a month...
You're gonna be rich.
Listen...
Coming.
- Liu, what about that matter?
- What?
Your count is wrong.
Didn't I tell you?
70 yuan more.
You can go.
In two days, it's yours.
I counted,
it should be just right.
Your count doesn't count.
If we say it's OK, it's OK.
- I'll talk to the manager.
- What's with you, kid?
Wait.
He's busy.
It's only 70.
One more day and it's yours.
70 yuan won't even
buy you medicine.
Come tomorrow.
I'll do it for you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I tell ya city people are no good.
They play you
when they pay you.
Play you like a fool.
It's nothing, one more day.
They can't play you no more.
Anyway you got a good job.
You get a bike in a month.
Just don't let people know
you're not from here.
Understand?
Look at you.
Brush your teeth!
Come on!
You sometimes go
to good places for delivery?
I heard there's music
in the hotel's toilet.
I wouldn't be able to pee...
Welcome.
Please come in.
Are you looking for someone?
Mr. Zhang.
Mr. Zhang?
He's waiting for you inside.
Thanks.
Wait. Badge.
A gentleman.
Slippers, sir.
In here please.
In here please.
Looking for someone, sir?
Mr. Zhang.
In here, please.
Mr. Zhang, a visitor.
You have a visitor.
What took you so long?
Finish this first.
Where's Gua?
Who're you?
Express Delivery.
Express Delivery?
What's that?
The company sent me
to see a Mr. Zhang.
I'm Zhang,
what you want?
You need delivery?
No.
Anyone needs delivery?
No. Get going.
You got the wrong person.
Get lost. People named Zhang
everywhere.
We don't care
if you're express delivery.
You pay after you showered.
But... I didn't
come to shower.
I'm here for Mr. Zhang.
Mr. Zhang sent for me.
But Mr. Zhang said
no such thing.
I am from the delivery company.
You can check this.
It's useless showing me that.
Take a look.
I said it's useless.
Anyway you pay for this.
But you asked me to get in.
I did, but...
You pay if you showered.
But you asked me
to shower!
I got in and you took off
my clothes.
You showered,
you have to pay.
Let go.
I have no money.
What's going on?
Let him go first.
Mr. Zhang,
he won't pay.
Said he's from express delivery,
looking for Mr. Zhang.
Yeah, I asked for it.
So it's you.
You can go.
What took you so long?
I waited for a long time.
So you went for a shower?
Quite a guy!
- Give me that document.
- Document?
Over there.
I am just about to leave.
Take this to Mr. Lee at 123
Wang Fu Jin Street. You hear?
Now go!
Manager, he hadn't paid.
Forget it, does he look like
he can afford it?
You're too much.
You have to work
even if you lost your bike.
What's more important,
bike or work?
Forget it, stop crying.
You're lucky the Manager
didn't fine you.
When you look for
another job, be more careful.
I say this for your good.
Hurry up and go.
You're right.
Sorry, so sorry.
It's okay.
Oh? He left already.
Don't worry,
it won't happen again.
We won't let you down again.
Oh, you still here?
Manager,
give me another bike.
Why can't you understand?
I didn't let you go
because of the bike.
It's our bad luck losing it.
And you had earned the bike.
So we don't owe each other.
But you got me in big trouble.
What you did...
put me in hot water all day.
They can ask for compensation.
Or they can sue you.
You lost your bike
and ask for another one.
Manager,
I don't want to leave.
You don't understand.
Being stubborn again.
If anything,
you don't have a bike.
What about I get it back?
What?
I can get the bike back.
You out of your mind?
Thousands of bikes
like that in Beijing.
I marked it.
You're a character.
No wonder they say
you're stubborn.
If you really marked it,
and if you can really find it
I'll give you another chance.
If you find the bike,
I'll keep you.
If you find your bicycle...
Are those your words?
Of course.
Absolutely. Jian, your dad
bought you a bike finally.
Are you done? Hurry.
Nice bike.
- It's not stolen, is it?
- Rubbish. Get lost!
- I'll go first.
- You don't have to.
My chain is loose.
You have a nice bike.
I'm leaving.
I know you're upset.
We promised but now it's off.
There's nothing I can do.
Your sister worked hard.
Now she gets into
a ranked school.
We have to pay her tuition.
I discussed it with your mom.
Your sister's
schooling is important.
Of course getting you a bike
is important too.
But we're not like others.
I just can't afford it.
You are old enough
to understand our situation.
Seeing you upset,
I feel bad inside.
Next month, after I got paid,
I'll buy you a bike.
No matter what, OK!
Let's go.
I'm tired.
Now get up.
Guei, you're so stubborn.
Are you going
to steal a bike?
Let's go.
Still waiting?
I'm leaving.
What're you doing?
What're you doing?
Stop! Hold it!
Stop there.
Don't move.
Look for another job.
Come here.
Who told you to steal a bike?
Is it worth it, a damn bike?
I don't care if you're guilty
or not. This is over.
You go back
where you came from.
Don't get me involved again.
Look for another job.
You're no longer
with the company.
Don't get our
company involved.
Leave me alone.
I'm busy today.
Tomorrow, OK?
All right?
Give me a call tonight.
- Let's go.
- You have to pay?
Oh, here's the money.
Come here.
Hey, what are you doing!
Hold it!
Stop it.
Stop!
Hold it.
Stop!
Stop!
A thief!
A thief!
Stop there!
Still trying to run?
- What happened?
- He stole my bike.
- I didn't steal.
- You didn't?
I saw him pushing
the bike away.
Chased him all the way.
Stole bike, huh?
- I don't know him.
- Take him to the police.
- Did you steal it?
- It's my bike.
It's yours?
- Where does it say it's yours?
- Don't waste your breath,
get the bike.
Take him to the police.
What?
You want to hold on?
Take the bike.
You want to hold on?
Take the bike.
Some nerve,
stealing our bike.
Watch it!
You're here?
Stay and play some.
Don't want to play.
Play while you wait.
Let's go.
Shit! Game over.
Give me some tokens.
You over?
I don't have any.
Me again?
I'd been buying all day.
Just this once. I'm buying
tokens. Wait for me.
- You saw Xiao?
- I didn't.
You saw Xiao?
I didn't.
You hold the tokens.
We looked everywhere.
It just gone.
It drove me up the wall.
The past two days.
I was afraid it's not safe.
Now look what happened?
Even I can't find it.
Shit!
Even if there were a thief,
he wouldn't know
where to look.
Besides,
no one was here.
Jian,
I didn't want to ask you.
But I have to.
Tell me, did you take it?
I didn't.
Two families together
are like one family.
You're not a child.
You should know
the right and the wrong.
This matter about losing
money is now over.
I'll take your word.
Because you're my son.
The bike I promised you...
I'll get it next month.
I'll keep my words this time.
I don't want it.
Are you mad at me?
OK, don't mention it.
Get back.
Damn it, it can't be so!
He really found it!
Wake up.
Good for you.
You people! Right out
of "The story of Qiu Ju".
Everything OK?
OK. Things will work out.
I'll have mercy.
Go in.
Be careful from now on.
Good morning, sir!
Jian, let's go biking.
Wanna go biking?
You go.
Come with us.
- Let's go.
- You go. Don't bug me.
- We'll leave you behind then.
- We're going.
Look for us
at the usual place.
Don't be upset.
It's just a bike.
So you lost it.
Buy another one.
Don't let it get to you.
Is it worth it?
Worth it.
Sorry... let's go.
You go first.
But you have no bike...
I can take you.
I don't need you to take me.
Then, how about you
taking me?
You can't go home
without me?
Just go, stop bugging me.
Don't let it go to your head.
She is out of our league.
Come here.
- Who's that?
- Da Huan.
He's really great.
Easy... easy.
Is your bike really hot?
Stolen? Get lost, bastard!
Easy, it just a damn bike!
- Not a big deal,
if you did steal it...
- Stop the rubbish.
- Why so pushy?
- So, what if I do!
- Why pushy?
- What if I do?
- What a fatty!
- Say it again!
- Come on.
- What the heck make
you so pushy?
You teased me.
- Just joking!
- What joke?
But you're too much.
- Calling me "a fatty"?
- Stop fighting.
You starting first.
Just joking!
- Over a damn joke!
- Don't indulge your tongue.
We're leaving. Bye.
Wait up, Da Huan.
If you didn't steal the bike,
let's look for him.
Anybody knows...
where does he work?
Heard he's at some
Express Delivery.
Fei Da.
Hold it! Stop him!
Where you going?
Stop there!
Stealing bikes?
That's it.
Don't second-guess.
We're leaving.
- Where?
- Here.
You bastard!
- Why you hit me?
- Since when did you
start stealing?
I didn't steal.
You didn't?
Then how does this bike
end up in your hand?
It's because you didn't keep
your words. For years,
you promised to buy me a bike.
Every time you didn't
come through.
Said I'll get it if I get into
vocational school. I did,
but where was the bike?
Said if I rank in the top
five of the class.
I ranked fifth in the school.
Did you buy it?
Now it's her.
Because she got into
a ranked school.
You treat me like I'm a kid.
I won't believe you again.
I won't be fooled again.
Even if the parents
were wrong,
- you can't go stealing bikes.
- I didn't steal.
Then how did you
get that bike?
I bought it.
No, he stole it.
This is mine.
- I bought it myself.
I didn't steal yours.
- Let go.
How did you buy it?
Where you get the money?
Where did the money
come from?
Tell me that!
It's money
for buying my bike.
What you mean?
Money to buy my bike
is my money.
None of your business
if I want to.
- Bastard.
- Why you hit me?
You stole from your family?
- That bike is...
- So it was you.
Did you buy me a bike?
How many times
you promised?
That's it.
We know what's going on.
It was our fault.
Push your bike away.
- Why you let him take it away?
I bought this myself.
- Let go!
You can't take it away.
- Stop him.
- Who dare to?
I'll stop you. Get back.
Give me the bike.
Give me back the bike.
I bought this myself.
I didn't steal it.
You can't do that!
My mom and your dad said
it's our fault.
Paying too much
attention on me!
I think that bike
is yours too.
Even if you
bought it used.
You bought it, you didn't steal it.
It's too unfair.
Jian, we can't
let it go like this.
You give it to him
because he said it's his?
But I said it's mine,
why didn't you give it to me?
Well, you paid for this, right?
He said his bike was stolen.
He should look for the thief.
We're not thieves.
Jian, this is a bad deal.
I'd never had it so bad.
Never treated like this.
One word from you, Jian.
And we go after him
and get back the bike.
One word from you
and we'll do it.
Just say it.
You trying to be funny?
Whose bike is this?
My bike.
Still say it's yours?
He said it's his bike.
Our friend bought this.
It's mine. I marked it.
A mark? Where?
Right here.
A few scratches like that?
Hey, wait... bike coming.
A mark! So this is yours.
You want to take the bike now?
If you go out everyday,
and leave a mark on a bike
and the bike is yours?
Then you don't need to work.
This bike is originally mine.
Still say it's yours?
- We talked your ears off
and it's still yours?
- Damn it.
You're really bull-headed.
Think about it.
I'll ask you one last time.
Whose bike is this?
This bike is mine.
- Whose?
- It's mine!
Whose? Huh, whose?
This is mine.
Still yours?
Let go of me.
Still yours.
Wait. Wait.
Let's talk.
Whose bike this is...
wait.
I only know
that the day before,
he paid 500 yuan for it
at the used-bike market.
Then he replaced some parts
like the seat cover and handle bar.
He replace the spoke.
It cost 80.
And here's 20 yuan change.
See this 20?
I don't care
whose bike this is originally.
But he paid 500 for it
at the used-bike market.
So this is his now.
You go after the thief
who stole it.
But this bike is mine.
Stop the trash talk.
Wait, let me talk to him.
Regardless of what happened.
Regardless of who
used to own it.
This bike, I tell you.
I paid 500 for it.
You said your bike was stolen.
It's none of my business.
You go after the thief.
But don't go after me.
Who can prove
you didn't steal it?
- Let go.
- Get him!
Want to see
who's stronger?
- Got him! Loosen his hands.
- OK.
Quick!
Guys, let's settle this.
Tired.
We're hungry too.
What you say?
I have an idea.
Say it.
Listen to it.
If you really like this bike,
you can take it.
But Jian bought this.
No bike, what about money?
He should have
his money back.
- How much you
paid for this, Jian?
- 500 yuan.
That's it.
You pay him 500, OK?
500 yuan
and you take the bike.
And we're not charging you
for the cover. 500 yuan,
it's a good deal.
I don't have it.
I spent money on it already.
- Spent money on it? So did I!
- Who hadn't?
Don't forget the seat cover.
It was my money.
And the spoke too.
Well, what about 400?
400 yuan.
What about 400?
Four bills, OK?
You're so stubborn.
What about 300?
There he goes again.
He just won't talk.
Is it too much?
What do you say, buddy?
Give us an idea.
You're good with ideas.
We'd been here all day.
We're all tired.
Can't take it no more!
Here all day.
OK, I have one more idea.
- Good idea?
- Say it.
You and Jian take turn
with the bike.
Not a good idea at all.
You got a better idea?
Let's see if you have
anything better?
- Well, we can't come up
with anything.
- You don't want money.
This is not a money thing.
We'd been at it all day
from daylight to now.
It's dark now.
I'm hungry if you're not.
We wasted energy
on this bike thing.
Money and time too.
You know that, huh?
Here, have a smoke.
Why give him smoke?
What for?
This is called negotiation.
What negotiation?
You're a comedian.
What you say?
- What about it, Jian?
- OK.
Let's call it this way.
Take turns?
Alternate days?
You agree?
How do you work
when you don't have the bike?
Look! Mom.
See what I told you!
What're you doing here, Qin?
Let's talk about this later.
Nothing wrong with my bike.
It's a little beat-up.
But it's better than none.
What're you looking at?
Wait.
What's your name?
Guo Lian-guei.
I'm Jian.
Never can imagine this.
A maid.
Who're you talking about?
The one you ran into.
Always came here for soy sauce.
What happened to her?
She wore her boss'
high heels.
And her clothes.
Even sold some of them.
The boss found out.
What about her?
Fired and disappeared.
Gone to her hometown.
Had I known she's also
from the village...
Fire!
Oh. Not a bad bike.
- Let's go.
- Bye.
Damn you.
You take... this bike.
I won't ride it.
I don't need it.
- Here! Quick!
- Go after it!
Why are you following me?
Get lost. Stop following me!
Go away.
Damn it, there!
Stop!
Stop!
Hold it.
You're being stupid.
I don't know the way.
- Why are they after me?
- Not you. They're after me.
Go away.
Get him down.
Stop!
Not my business.
It's not my business.
- That's true.
- Then why did you run?
Damn, you're bullying me.
Don't touch me!
Let go of my bike,
not my business.
Let's go.
Stop it! Let's go!
Not my business.
That's my bike...
Don't break it...
Give me back my bike...
Not my business.
Give it back...
Please, don't break my bike...
