He who merits,
through qualification and virtue,
the highest ranks
is, however, not counted
among the members
of our Central Committee.
And so
we only can explain it
by reading this letter
from the hand and word
of Comrade Ernesto Guevara.
A self-explanatory letter.
It says the following:
"Havana, Year of Agriculture.
Fidel, at this moment
I remember many things:
When I met you
at María Antonia's house,
when you proposed that I come along,
all the tension
involved in the preparations.
One day they came by
asking who to notify in case of death,
and the real possibility of it
struck us all.
Later we knew it was true
that in a real revolution,
one either wins or dies.
I feel that I have completed
the part of my duty
that tied me to the Cuban
revolution in its territory,
and I say farewell to you,
to the comrades, to your people,
who now are mine.
I formally resign my positions
in the leadership of the party,
my post as minister,
my rank of comandante,
and my Cuban citizenship.
Other nations of the world summon
my modest efforts of assistance.
I can do what is denied to you
by your responsibility as Cuba's leader,
and the time has come for us to part.
If my last hour
arrives beneath other skies,
my last thought
will be for this people,
and especially for you. "
Let me see you without the hat.
You're the living portrait of your father.
You have the money?
Yes.
We could wait until things settle down.
If we don't do it now,
we'll have to wait another 50 years.
One more.
One, two,
three.
Aleidita, remember Mom and Dad
sit at the head of the table.
But since Dad's not here,
we'll give his friend Ramón the seat.
Here it is. Four and five.
What is he doing?
I don't know.
Go see what your brother is doing.
Go see what your brother is doing.
Special representative from the O AS?
Yes, the Organization
of American States.
Just a second, please.
There's a man who is
a special O AS representative.
Organization of American States?
Yes, let him in.
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.
Mister, may I help you
with your suitcase?
No need.
I'm worried about Monje.
Why?
When I asked him about
the 20 men he promised,
he said, "Which men?"
As if I had never talked to him.
It's okay.
Apolinar.
Serapio.
- How old are you, Serapio?
- Sixteen.
At 16, a man already knows
what he wants.
Hello. I'm Camba.
Ramón.
Do you know who that man is?
He came with you.
The man you just shook hands with
is Che Guevara.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Could I shake his hand again?
- Ramón.
- Ricardo.
- This is Coco, Inti's brother.
- I know, I know.
- The farm is under his name.
- Braulio.
- How are you doing, bro?
- How are you?
- Miguel!
- What's up?
- Urbano, how was the trip?
- Quite tough.
Rolando.
You're Inti?
- It's an honor to meet you.
- The honor is mine. I'm Ramón.
This is Dr. Ernesto Maymura.
He's in the Bolivian Communist Party
and studied medicine in Havana.
- Where did you do your residency?
- At Calixto García.
And so we fell asleep.
Do you know where we woke up?
- In the United States.
- In New York.
We went right in with our
Panamanian passports.
Everything was going smoothly
until we almost screwed it up
because we were so hungry!
Braulio says, "Let's go over there,
they have hot dogs."
So we got there and, of course,
the vendor was Dominican.
The first thing he says is,
"Oh, but you're Cuban."
Braulio just looks at him.
He served us the hot dogs
without another word.
I made a mistake
and took the wrong flight.
You didn't make a mistake,
you discovered something.
What did we discover?
If you dress an elephant as a man,
it would still make it into Bolivia.
Good one!
To Bolivia or anywhere else!
Brother!
Let's go.
Hello.
- Eustaquio.
- Welcome, Eustaquio. I'm Ramón.
- Salustio.
- Ramón.
- I'm Pedro.
- Ramón.
Paco.
- Aniceto.
- Tuma, this is Aniceto.
Carlos.
Tuma.
- Willy.
- I'm Chapaco.
I'll need a few days
to learn all your names.
In the last conversation
I had with Monje,
I made it clear that if we really
want to change this society,
we are the ones
most capable of doing it.
That's why the party
has to support the guerrilla.
Monje expressed his doubts about
the armed struggle.
He began to talk about
his love for his family.
And here people also have children
and women that they have left behind.
That is why,
with all due respect, Ramón,
I don't think the party
will support an armed struggle,
much less Mario Monje.
So I want to ask for permission
to go back to La Paz
and recruit
the best people from the party
to join the group.
First we have to meet Mario Monje
as we agreed to.
Not doing so would be inappropriate.
Conditions are not right for
the kind of struggle you propose.
Mario, anywhere in the world where men
are being exploited by men,
conditions are right.
When children work in mines
and 50 percent of miners
don't reach 30 years of age...
When these same miners
go on strike
to improve their wages
and they are massacred by the army,
are those conditions right or not?
If infant mortality rates
are the highest in Latin America
because of lack of hospitals
and medical care,
the situation is right for me.
If we learned something in Cuba,
it's that a popular uprising
that isn't backed by armed struggle
has no chance of taking power.
When people learn that
this movement is led by a foreigner,
they will turn their backs on you.
You will die heroically,
but you have no hope
of achieving victory.
Then let's change the name of Bolivia.
After all, Simón Bolívar
was a Venezuelan, right?
Comrade Monje,
your job and the party's job is to
make it clear to the people that Che,
that Ramón, is a revolutionary
from the continent, not a foreigner.
It's true. Ramón is like Simón Bolívar.
The party does not endorse
armed struggle.
You are free to abandon it.
And you will have our support if you do.
If you stay, the party will no longer
pay your stipends.
As the head of the Communist Party here,
I advise you to leave with me.
With a mojito,
you cannot grind up the leaves.
- I know about mojitos.
- So you know you can't grind them up.
You cannot grind the leaves.
How are you?
Come over.
Just a second, I'm finishing here.
Then you have to cover it.
Half an hour in the oven
with the correct temperature.
No, I forgot something.
On top of the cream, put cheese.
Cheese.
Excuse us for a second.
We need to talk.
Go ahead.
- Everything good?
- Yes, good.
Why did Che change
the location of the camp?
I think he wanted to be
closer to Argentina.
He had contacts
waiting for him in Alto Beni.
The mines are there.
Miners are more politicized.
They support us.
Che needed somewhere
to train for six months
where he wouldn't be bothered.
How is that Ñancahuazú region?
It's a very remote place.
Life is hard there.
In fact, the few peasants who live there
don't trust foreigners.
The Soviets won't allow Monje
to make a deal.
No.
We have some money
that we want you to take to Bolivia.
And we need to find out if there's
anything else that we need to send.
We also found a cave
which could be useful.
Good morning.
I told the men that I'm going back
to La Paz today.
I'm resigning from the party.
My mission is over.
- Okay.
- The jeep arrives this afternoon.
Why don't you stay in the camp
until the jeep arrives?
I would like to be alone.
I'll wait at the zinc house.
Fine.
I'll return on January 10th,
with my decision made.
Okay. Monje, we'll be here.
Coco, find Moisés Guevara.
Tell him I want to talk to him.
We're leaving in a few days
on a training march
for about 20, 25 days.
I'll go to the mines.
I'll be back between
the 4th and 14th of February.
I'd like to come back earlier,
but it's Carnival season,
La Diablada in Oruro.
My men will be all spread out,
it'll be difficult to gather them.
You are our primary connection
to the outside.
Your cover needs to remain intact.
You can't come back to the camp.
There may be a strike at Siglo XX.
And your husband?
How are things?
Did you get the trip straightened out?
I arranged everything so that
he could go study in Bulgaria.
What about Barrientos?
What happened there?
We've been in contact.
- What happened?
- I think he likes me.
I know he likes me.
- Should I try to see him again?
- Yes.
Tania, when this thing heats up,
your job will make the difference.
Here are provisions:
Sugar, eggs, flour, what's needed.
The new employee, is he Bolivian?
Yes.
- How much do I owe you?
- No, keep your money.
- No, keep it.
- We are neighbors now.
- Take it.
- I'm not doing this for the money.
I want to take part in your project.
I have relatives in transportation.
You can rely on me for everything.
Okay?
Go with Tuma to see our neighbor
and tell him we need his help.
Involve him without offering much.
Tell him that we'll pay for
what he carries in the jeep
and nothing else.
Tumaini.
Put a little fear in him.
And explain to him that if he betrays us
he'll pay with his life.
You can drive back and forth
to town in your jeep
so you can buy the food we need
and we'll pay you well.
Yes, sure, whatever you want.
- Good.
- I have to tell you something.
In private, because it's something
I would only say to a friend.
Okay, fine.
You want some more?
There were two little birds
who lived in a tree.
One was quiet, the other liked to
fluff his feathers and sing and sing.
One day a hunter came by.
He heard him sing,
then put him in his sights and shot.
But the other bird, the quiet one,
nothing happened to him.
He saved his own life.
It's a nice story.
- It's good.
- It's good. I liked it.
I really liked it. I know what you mean.
You junkie son of a bitch.
We'll see.
Good morning.
- How are you?
- Good morning.
This looks beautiful!
I see the factory is doing well.
- Good morning.
- Come with me.
Can we come in? Show me the house.
I see you are really busy.
Soon.
I don't know when, but soon
we will confront the enemy.
Our contact
with the outside will be limited.
Some of us will die,
and it's sad to see your comrades die
because you can't help them
with your limited resources.
Food will be scarce.
Sometimes we won't have
anything to eat.
And if all of this weren't enough,
we'll have to endure the harsh weather.
By the end,
we will have become human waste.
That's all I can promise you.
Think it over.
You still have time to go back home.
Afterwards it will be too late.
In closing,
I would like to repeat
what I said to Monje.
Me? I'm already here.
They would have to kill me
to get me out of here.
I will be at the side
of those who stay, until victory.
How much corn
can you sell us right now?
There's not even enough for us, sir.
At least sell us a pig.
They're piglets, just little ones.
How am I going to sell them?
Besides, they belong to the missus.
How much is your pig, madam?
I can't sell them,
they're only sucklings.
I'll pay you 30,000 bolivianos.
I'm not sure.
How about 40,000?
Should we sell or not?
Make it 50,000, okay?
Okay.
What conditions do they live in?
Very bad.
Do they have children?
They have six kids.
Barefoot, all full of ticks.
One of the little boys
has a badly infected eye.
How old is the peasant?
About 40, 50 years old.
I think he's a bit older, you know?
And when you offered the money,
how did he react?
His eyes sparkled
when he saw the money.
Hello.
Good day, Honorato.
Come, I want to talk to you.
We want there
to be schools for your children,
and hospitals to take care of them,
and roads to be built
so trucks can reach here
and you can sell your products.
Don't you want all these things?
Well, yes, that would be nice.
But in order to do this,
we need your help.
Two and three.
Look.
You are a big man.
May God repay you.
- It's all right.
- May God repay you.
Okay.
- See you.
- Bye, madam.
- Goodbye.
- May God repay you.
What are you doing?
That's communal food.
No one helps themselves
without being given permission to do so.
Understood?
I'll let you off this one time
because you don't know the rules yet.
- Everything belongs to the group.
- But we're hungry.
We're all hungry, Darío.
But one can feeds six for breakfast.
There's one missing.
I have no radio coverage with
the main camp, so I'm going back.
No, big guy. You're not going anywhere.
Stay with us until 6, then you can
tell Ramón how far we've gone.
No, I'm going now
while it's still light out.
Hey, I'm giving you an order!
Stay here until 6.
- I'm leaving now.
- You're not leaving, can't you hear?
You listen to me, I'm fucking going!
You'll have to go through
my machete first!
- Hey!
- What's wrong with you?
Hey, Miguel!
What's going on here?
Listen, listen!
Miguel, look at me!
Hey, you're comrades.
- For what? He has to follow orders!
- That's enough!
Miguel, you have to control yourself
and give orders with respect
like a boss.
You cannot threaten or hit anyone here.
That's not permitted by the guerrilla.
And you know that better than anyone.
And you
lied.
Miguel never hit you with the machete
handle. He didn't even touch you.
The one thing I won't tolerate here
is a liar.
One more incident like that, Pacho,
and I'll send you back to Cuba
with a dishonorable discharge.
Incidents like this destroy group morale
and our readiness for combat,
not only of you or you,
but of the entire group.
If anyone feels weak or discouraged,
he shouldn't resort to such methods,
but should speak
to the political commissaries,
to Inti or Rolando or to me,
and we will peacefully discharge him
from the group.
I didn't come here to work.
We should have a rifle.
Listen to me.
Ramón could be back now
in Cuba with his family,
with many cars, enjoying comfort
everywhere he goes.
But he is here because he wants you
to have a better life,
so your kids can learn
to read and write.
I'm just a baker,
I've been a slave all my life,
but someday I'll be free.
Rest, because we'll be
leaving at sunrise.
- We're not staying here?
- No, we need to be patient.
We are taking you to another camp
where you'll be safer.
Have you had any problems?
There's a neighbor that thinks
we're making cocaine.
The police have
been here twice already.
When's the last time
you heard from Ramón?
Over a week ago.
We lost contact with the whole group.
Moisés, hello!
Who did you bring?
Contacts from Argentina and France.
Chino is from Perú.
Are you going back to Camiri?
I need to talk to Ramón first.
Monje and the party
are interfering with everything.
They even convinced the last Bolivians
that were trained in Cuba
not to come here and join us.
Hey, listen.
Hey. Everyone keep away
from her hammock.
Whoever touches her
will be severely punished.
Listen to me, Arturo.
They are Bolivian,
and they have come to fight.
You must not disrespect them.
I need two volunteers to go hunt
and I thought about you.
Bring something good
because supplies are running low.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
We'll get money for this!
Hey, that sounds like a plane.
Airplane!
Come on, Ramón.
Get down, Ramón.
They caught two of Moisés' men
who deserted,
and they talked like parrots.
Soldiers went into the zinc house.
They seized Tania's jeep and a mule.
- Who gave orders to move camp?
- Antonio did.
Tell him we'll win the war with bullets.
- Bring back all to the camp.
- Okay.
Rolando.
Prepare an ambush.
Was there anything in the jeep?
I had some recordings
of Fidel's speeches.
They're going to search the jeep
which will lead them to the hotel,
and the hotel will lead them
to your apartment,
and your apartment will
lead them to everything.
I couldn't trust anyone.
Every time I called
they hung up the phone on me.
- That's why I decided to bring...
- You had strict orders not to return.
That's five years of lost work.
Tania, five!
Give me your rifle.
You and the visitors will leave
as soon as we prepare your trip.
Hold your fire!
We surrender! We surrender!
My superiors are cowards
and don't tell us anything.
I didn't want to be here. I swear.
Calm down.
- Please don't kill me, please.
- Calm down.
I suffer from rheumatism, I swear.
- No one is going to hurt you.
- And I have a bad heart.
Don't believe a word Major Plata says.
He's a liar and he's abusive.
He sells our food to the stores
and keeps the money for himself.
He hits people.
Look how he's crying. He's a coward.
So, what should we do with him?
Kill him.
Yes, kill him.
Put him on his side.
- Did you give him a painkiller?
- Not yet.
Give him some morphine.
We have committed ourselves
to a struggle in which,
whether we like it or not,
we may have to kill
or be killed,
because we are fighting
for Bolivia's freedom.
You can do it now.
I won't be returning.
I'm quitting the army.
We hope to see you soon.
Because we could use more
of your ammunitions and weapons.
Long live a free Bolivia!
Long live
the National Liberation Army!
No one wanted to stay.
That takes time.
No, if you leave now
you could be arrested.
I think you should wait until
we start our march northward.
- You're going north?
- Yes.
Then we can let you off
on the Cochabamba road.
No, I don't think that's right.
That could take two or three months.
Ciro, we're at war.
Give me a guide.
Give me a guide
and I'll make the arrangements.
I can't break up the group
under these circumstances.
I'll think about an alternative.
But any move we make will be made
with the group as a whole.
Ramón, your books are soaked.
Put them on those rocks to dry.
Arturo.
Water got in the radio,
everything is rusted.
What are you saying,
that it doesn't work?
It still receives, but it doesn't send.
Shit. Now we're really screwed.
Not quite. We still have
the visitors to relay messages.
The army says that you are here
to practice Communism.
That you have no God,
that you all work for the state.
That you rape women
and destroy families.
You kill those who refuse to serve you
and want to make us slaves.
And what kind of freedom do you have?
The kind where
I can do whatever I want.
Listen to me.
None of what they said is true.
We haven't come to harm anybody.
We just want to buy
some food from you, that's all.
But I have nothing, only this.
How much do you want for this?
Whatever you have. Take it.
I'll stay if you need me.
What I need now are peasants.
It's better if you go to France and make
a network to promote our cause,
so they can send us money,
medicine and radios.
I'd also need you to take
some messages to Cuba.
I'll write Sartre and Bertrand Russell
to organize a worldwide fund
on behalf of the Bolivian revolution.
Don't worry.
We'll take you out of here
when you recover.
I'm not worried.
Tumaini.
Here, it's yours.
To protect you.
I'll move southward with the vanguard
and take the visitors out by Muyupampa.
I want you to stay with the sick
until we come back.
How long will you be gone?
About three days.
Rolando.
Go with Loro to replace
Benigno and Miguel.
Ramón.
There's no one in the house.
So leave the money with a note.
Pick up everything, we're leaving.
Ramón.
There's no sign of Loro.
That's what they've given me, captain.
What good is this for?
Are there any shops here?
They took my pigs and my corn.
You helped them
and they gave you money.
Now you are going to help us
eliminate them, otherwise...
And now you are stealing
my chickens, captain.
Listen to me closely, smartass,
really pay attention.
Let me know immediately
if the guerrillas come back again.
You have a good heart.
You'll do it.
Good morning.
I'm just here to write an article
on the guerrilla movement in Bolivia.
Trying to confirm
the Bolivian army's rumors
that Che Guevara
is the leader of the group,
and there is a woman with him.
This guy is a Trojan horse.
I don't want any Cubans talking to him.
- What's up, Darío?
- Food is ready.
Start serving. Children first.
Are you from Paraguay?
Paraguay? No way, I'm from Oruro.
Okay, kids.
Once you are done
you have to leave, right?
We can't leave, because that gringo
owes us money.
How much does he owe you?
- Fifty pesos.
- Fifty pesos.
I spoke with the Englishman
about the way out.
He says the army knows him in Camiri.
We could get out that way.
You are the ones to make that decision.
We could use our papers
to pass as reporters, no problem.
Inti will take you up the road to Camiri.
Try not to go through Muyupampa.
Don't get yourselves captured.
If that happens, remember
to always deny my presence
and the presence of all Cubans here
at each moment and at all costs.
- Do you have a cigarette?
- No, I don't.
Goddamn it!
Why don't you smoke?
Smoking's great.
But I do have some tobacco.
Thanks, brother.
Where are the Cubans?
- Well, they should be...
- Darío, come here!
I told you not to talk to that guy.
What did he say?
He didn't say anything, brother.
I asked him for a cigarette.
You're going to the back.
Freeze! Stop right there!
Drop your backpacks
and show us your papers, shitheads!
Throw them on the ground.
The Frenchman's name
is Régis Debray.
Masquerades as a radical author,
a Marxist journalist.
Spends a lot of time in Cuba,
and is a good friend of Fidel Castro.
The Argentine's name is Ciro Bustos.
A painter and also a writer.
This character collected money in 1963
for a local guerrilla movement
led by Jorge Massetti.
Massetti was killed
by the police in Argentina in 1964.
Two mercenaries, a Frenchman
and an Argentine, were killed
when confronted by the army
in the area known as Vaca Guzmán.
The Guzmán region,
that's in Muyupampa.
If that's true, those bastards
are going to pay for it, bigtime.
The three of them were arrested.
They were taken to Camiri.
Who told you that?
We stopped a van
that came from Muyupampa
with a German priest and a man.
They gave all the information.
They want to talk to the boss.
They gave us some sweets and stuff.
- Inti, have those people seen you?
- No.
Many of your men are not Bolivian.
That's why no one trusts you.
But they trust you.
They asked us to talk to you.
Then tell them that our army
is open to anyone who wants to fight.
They should be here with us.
No, they reject everything
that has to do with violence.
So people in power can use
violence to oppress us,
but we can't use it to free ourselves?
They don't want to join you
and they don't want you here.
You don't have the right
to ruin their lives.
You are going to have peace today
in Muyupampa
on the condition that you bring us
a truck of food and medical goods
by 6 p.m. On this watch.
We'll meet at Nemesio's farm.
We'll pay for everything.
Then we'll go, you have my word.
Okay.
Open your mouth.
They will torture Bustos and Debray.
They'll learn everything.
Ramón.
I think you should change your name.
That's not a bad idea.
Plane! Get everyone out of the house.
- Run!
- Cover yourselves!
Quickly, under the tree!
Get out of here!
Most of these men are Cubans.
Don't be mistaken.
