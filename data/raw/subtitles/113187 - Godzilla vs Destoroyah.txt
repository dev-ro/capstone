Look over there!
Bass Island has dissappeared
Godzilla vs. Destroyer
What's Happening to Godzilla?
The color of the ray, the glowing skin, we've 
never seen this before
Why is this happening
Bass Island was destroyed by nuclear fission
Dr. Marvin, beside me,
has an interesting report on Godzilla
For reasons of safety,
please use the jammer.
"Personal considerations
on the structure of Godzilla"
Your father... was the son of Dr. Yamane?
His adoptive son.
Godzilla killed all his family.
Then, Dr. Yamane raised him like his own son.
My father wanted his children to become famous scientists.
But I failed all my exams and my sister is a TV Reporter.
He wouldn't be very proud of us, I guess
So...Yukari Yamane is your sister?
Exactly
You sent your thesis to the United States.
May I ask why?
I didn't have any other choice, I sent it to G-Force but they
sent it back
They just plain ignored me
I am not surprised.
My professor took it for a joke and refused to mark it.
Would you agree to come to G-Center?
To tell the truth, my father spoke to me alot about Godzilla.
It collected a mass of data about it.
But frankly, I wasnt all that serious about it
But...
Godzilla is just a hobby for me
And in any event, the conferences do not solve anything.
In that case... I should leave
Miss Sagusa...You already returned
Of course. One sees oneself over there.
Wait... Did you say Miki Saegusa?
Yeah I did
She works at G Center?
Yes. She leads the team in charge of the little one
Then I'm Coming, Let me work for you!
Tomorrow... No wait, Today!
Well, come. Let us go there.
After analysis oxygen supplements,
 We discovered microniser atoms
-You thus have micro-oxygen?
-Yes
It won you the Nobel prize in 1995, but
how will it change everyday life?
Divers for example, will have smaller oxygen bottles
And fish nourished with micro-oxygen
will become much larger than the others.
In fact, micro-oxygen could to solve the worlds food shortage
That's all nice and dandy, but what about the darker side of it
It appears that that could be useful to manufacture weapons.
It is true that these tiny atoms can bore any metal.
-Yes it's possible
-Any weapon using this technology would be frightening.
This said, I doubt extremely that whoever interested would 
like to risk a world war.
It would be unthinkable
See, Micro-oxygen occurs naturally
So, I didn't discover anything that wasnt
previously there.
Thank you doctor, Here is an invention
full with promises for the future.
You didn't hold back at all.. why did you bring up the weapons?
He's kind of a know it all don't you think?
He is frank, thats true but he might be good for your love life.
What does that mean?
Nothing, I was joking
I have a message for you
Thank you
Wonder what she wants?
I still can't find the little one... I 
wonder if its okay?
Perhaps..... The small one already died?
Miki, Here's the new guy.
Kenichi Yamane, with your service.
What makes you say that it died?
Godzilla became a super-monster. It was
 regenerated, drawing its energy of  the nuclear explosion.
But perhaps that the other did not survive.
It may be that it died
It is possible that the Small one
did not survive the change.
Microphone-oxygen is troubling you?
Yes
It is almost identical to what Dr. Serizawa invented.
the invention that killed him
It destroys all the oxygen in the water, making
the water sterile.
If it were ever used as a weapon, it would
be worse than an Atom Bomb
Then the doctor destroyed his notes
and his own life for peace
But the invention of this Dr. Ijuin
seem to be the same thing.
You must tell him to stop his research
before its used as a weapon...
It can't be.....
Emiko Yamane...
The girlfriend of the doctor...?
You know of him?
All the scientists in Japan know of him, he's famous
Well then you know of Dr. Serizawa's work.
Of course I do.
In that case you must know of his invention.
When I started to study oxygen, I read all of his papers
and I know my micro-oxygen is very similar to his invention
So you know all the risks, and why he took his life?
The world has undergone several changes in the last 
40 years you know
This discovery could be beneficial.
But, Serizawa died to prevent that it is used.
One cannot let sentimentalism  block scientific progress.
I did nothing but discover an existing thing.
I did not produce anything
that nature did not already see.
This is weird, these readings aren't right.
I don't think we should worry about them, they can't be right
The thermal regulation is ruined
and the elevator is broken down!
What's happening?!
The elevator shaft is melting!
Whats that idiot doing?
Mysterious accidents in the tunnel under bay of Tokyo
What is the origin of these accidents?
The high temperature of sea water
that we raised this morning
indicate a nuclear fission too much
intense in the body of Godzilla.
Nuclear fission is what feeds Godzilla in energy.
But this power station must be cooled by the air and water.
The incident at Bass Island made his fission go out of control.
What is going to happen?
Godzilla will gain more power..and....explode
Explode?!
Say Godzilla does explode, what kind of damage are we
looking at?
Devastating... much more than all nuclear bombs going
off at once.
According to our calculations, the atmosphere will be
heated and catch fire.
-What happened?
-We do not know yet
And the lift shaft which melted?
I do not have information.
The temperature climbed.
I do not know any more at this stage.
But Doctor?
On the place of the catastrophe,
the experts are dumb on the causes of the accident.
One evoked a big rise of the temperature
having dissolved the lift shaft
but that was not confirmed.
You took samples
of ground in the tunnel, hein?
Precisely where first Godzilla
was killed 40 years ago.
You are very observant.
You will go far.
I spoke with my aunt, and...
and what?
You take to me for an apprentice
wizard in search of chaos?
These samples contain
perhaps information
It is this period who should provide us indices.
The ground was deprived of oxygen
million years ago.
It was one time
where there was no oxygen
There is billion years,
at the Precambrian era.
These creatures managed to survive?
They were different than the life we see today, we're gathering
samples of them now.
And they will give us ALL the answers?
You're not taking this very seriously.
Forgive me. But I did not make fun of you, I promise
You seem so romantic.
Perhaps that I am  But I am not a sorcerer's apprentice.
-Signs of life?
-Impossible
No more attacks on Godzilla?
Indeed, Sir,
we do not have the choice.
But, one cannot remain
the crossed arms, one must stop it!
It would be to put fire with an explosives magazine.
An explosion would be started who would destroy planet.
Yeah but... we cant just.. sit and do nothing...
If we launch an offensive,
it will have to be chemical.
Chemical?
You explain, I request from you.
We must kill it like us
killed first Godzilla.
You can't mean!!
The Oxygen Destroyer
Listen to me, Ken. Dr. Serizawa
destroyed all its research. on the oxygen destroyer
a good man was lost...
Even if you in factories one,
are you sure that it will be well used?
Not, I am not sure.
Well then it's not worth the danger don't you think?
But, my aunt, this time the Earth is in danger.
If we do not manufacture one of them,
we are lost.
But I do not like the idea, Ken....Do not do it,
whatever your reasons.
My aunt! It is me, Yukari.
Nuclear fission in the body of Godzilla!
It is still a secrecy. I say it to you, because you can perhaps help me. 
Ask Dr. Ijuin to build a weapon with his micro-oxygen
You are insane?
I cannot do that.
I know what you feel, aunt and you. But it is really
the only solution.
other signs of life?
Not, nothing.
Perhaps we were imagining it?
The sample indeed contained a life form.
Yo!
The Water?.... Its dissolving the fish!
Initially, I was not to manufacture of oxygen destructor.
And now, you want me to make one?
It is the only means of destroying Godzilla. All the others failed.
You are the only one that can do it!
I said it was possible, but It definetly would not be easy.
moreover?
I made analyses neighbouring ground.
I saw the effects of the oxygen destroyer.
If that had been used on the firm ground,
it is not any doubt that Tokyo would have transformed itself into cemetery.
Yes? Yamane.
What? With the aquarium?
I would like to take along this video to study it
Stop it, and make it larger
3d Scan
What is it?
A life form from the Precambrian era
Precambrian era?
But its changed.
It was a simple micro-organism inoffensive and inert.
but it was touched by the oxygen destroyer
And since, it evolved in an abnormal way.
What you fear already occurred.
The hole that you see there in is the proof. Like the fish.
It is impossible!
Micro-Oxygen has already spread.
Here Seacat 3. Godzilla was located in the north of Okinawa.
Red alert! With all the units, immediate takeoff.
Hong Kong, Taiwan, Okinawa. It is obvious, its coming towards us
Yes, but why, general?
Look at these whales who were killed.
You think that it is the Small one?
It is not a killer, I understand nothing there.
I don't know
But perhaps the incident on Bass Island changed him somehow
You think so?
I have to go find him no matter what
Where are you little one.... are you alright?
With all the cars, forms of life unknown factors in the industrial park.
Convey 105, us have just arrived.
Thank you
Hurry Up!
-We cant miss this story
-Quickly Quickly
Move back! Let pass police cars.
Move back! Let pass police cars.
Attention All Units
Attention All Units
Please Wait for Sigma Unit to arrive
-Roger!
Attention Sigma Unit!
Attention Sigma Unit!
We're entering the basement
Huh?
Here Sigma 7, we found
the creature! Level 3!
Sigma chief with all the units,
all on the level B!
Fall Back!
All units fall back!
Here a special flash. Mysterious creatures are 
announced sowing the disorder
in a building close to Tokyo Bay
I will now bring you to an onsite reporter
I am in the industrial park,
where confrontations oppose
special forces
and of the unknown creatures.
Agents
were seriously wounded...
There! Its over there!
Excuse me, You have to cease fire.
You have to now!!
Who are you?
Dr. Ijuin, physicist.
You cannot remain here,
the zone is dangerous.
There would be several creatures
of 3 m in height, reptile type.
What?
Look out!
Everyone! Move back!
Go! Go!
Run!
-Where is Yukari?
-I don't know!
Help!!!
Caution! Godzilla was located
in the strait of Bungo.
What is it doing?
He's looking for nuclear energy
Godzilla's coming!
-It's almost here
-Sound the alarm!
I imagine that his nuclear fission becomes so intense
he needs more energy
Godzilla is about to attack a nuclear plant, and we
are powerless to stop him
If we attack him General, we risk setting off
an explosion that would end us all.
Sir, the minister of defence wants to speak with you.
G-Force here....What?
Super X3 is taking off?
Super X3?
Super X3 is our newest weapon designed
to face nuclear disasters.
It is equipped with the latest cadmium tipped
missiles, but thats not all.
It uses the latest in cryogenic weapons.
Cryogenic Weapons?
It has a laser that can freeze anything below 200 degrees
celcius
Who is piloting it?
He's a new elite pilot, lets home he gets there in time.
Finished preliminary checking.
Initiate GMC
-All systems ready
-Recieved
Launch Every Zig
You know what you doing
Hanger doors..open!
For great justice!
Super X3.. Take Off!
Come on! Come on!
It's coming right for us!
Super X3 has passed S11, prepare for attack
Target in sight!
-Cryo Missiles ready
-Roger
-You see that? Godzilla's ray is more intense
-Armor is holding
He's slowing down
Cadmium missiles, fire!
The cryolasers will cool it
and cadmium will keep it cold.
I think it might work
-It's working
-Ready, CryoLaser!
Fire!
-Okay!
-We did it!
-Al Right
Sir, I have readings from Godzilla.
The Computer says his temperature is rising
but will remain frozen for 6 hours.
There's six hours, times almost up.
Let's hope he stays in the water until we're ready.
A report/ratio Q.G. Satellite of NASA.
The water temp is rising in the area.
What's he going to do now?
The target is active and is moving east.
East?
Why is he moving east?
Why isnt he going towards the reactor?
The fission is being controlled, perhaps he has enough fuel?
There, there is a peak, but that falls down.
cadmium finally seems to have an effect.
There will be no explosion then?
It doesn't appear so.
The creatures would have been calmed. But according to 
Dr. Ijuin, they could be agitated easily.
If the oxygen levels vary to greatly
The situation thus remains dangerous.
But the army is on stand by
and scientists are working on a way to eliminate 
these creatures.
-150 degrees
-160 degrees
-170 degrees
mix micro oxygen
It liquifies in -180 degrees
I hope that cryogen weapons will liquify the 
micro oxygen in these creatures
Excellent Doctor!
Hello
I see
They send troops in reinforcement of the special forces.
You are new, here?
Yeah, I came from an ESP school in the USA.
ESP is mainly just a hobby for me.
I am a paleontologist. Dinosaurs are really my thing but i 
never thought I'd be tracking Godzilla
That made seven years
that I work here.
Me also, I followed the course
of extrasensory perception.
I can already tell my powers are weakening
I don't even think I'm going to be able to find the little one...
Soon I wont be able to use my powers at all
I'm afraid
afraid?
Me, I am in a hurry to lose my capacities
to be able to carry out a normal life.
Truthfully
I want to settle down and be a normal girl
Get married and have children
-Godzilla!
-Everyone Run!
So you are alive.....
Last images catches of the helicopter, Mister.
The incident of the island of Bass
really modified.
He has changed so much
What you see here is not little Godzilla anymore
he's more like a...Godzilla Junior
It would be said that Godzilla
trajectory changed.
-I think he is trying to follow Junior
-It is incredible!
Is that even possible?
It is possible. Godzilla and Junior
are same species.
Your theory could prove to be exact.
So thats where you are going.
North?
Are you sure?
Bering Sea, here where it goes.
But of course!
It will join its nest. Why
I did not think of it earlier?
And if Godzilla continues Junior,
he also goes over there.
So then....
Godzilla is going towards the Bering Sea
Excuse me, I have news American Center-G.
It doesn't look good.
According to
the last statements satellite,
the temperature of Godzilla is climbing. It reached 900°C.
How is that Possible?
One succeeded in controlling fission, but its engine disaggregates.
It becomes unstable
What's going to happen to Godzilla?
Meltdown
Meltdown?
First his heart will meltdown
Then his body will melt, releasing tonnes of radiation.
But its fusion
will destroy also the Earth.
the China syndrome, but quite worse.
It's worse than the explosion, when will it happen?
It will happen at 1200 degrees
Its temperature climb 50°C per day!
What wants to say that fusion will occur in one week!
That would mean... meltdown will occur in a week.
Actually, the americans think it will be considerably less than that.
Godzilla will never arrive at the Bering Sea
We are on line above bay of Tokyo.
The soldiers have apparently exchanged their flame throwers
for cooling weapons
Until now, the creatures remain underground
CryoMaser ready to attack
Rise 138 degrees, 41 left
Attract the creatures from the ground.
The tanks need a good firing angle
Oxygen Tracer ready!
Sir!
CryoMasers are ready to fire.
Good
-Creature has been detected!
-Attention! Creatures have been detected!
The creatures are with our range!
Good, loans?
Guns cryolaser, fire!
Cryocanons, fire!
Cooling shells. Fire!
It's working Doctor!
Sir, the creatures are gathering
What do you mean?
There's too much microoxygen to measure!
What's happening in there?
It's incredible! The creatures joined together
to form a giant monster!
I know micro-oxygen does not have that kind of power
What does then?
an oxygen destroyer...
It has the power to destroy everything in its path
Destroyer...
Destroyer?
Destoyer and Godzilla, now we have two incredible monsters.
It is an oxygen destructor, but it's not made by man
An oxygen destroyer was deemed impossible to make.
but..
here it is, the thing that can prevent meltdown
What do you mean?
It was the only thing to work on the first Godzilla
It should work again.
You want Destroyer to fight Godzilla? Impossible
That's a rediculas idea...
I don't know, perhaps its not as rediculas as we think,
 I dont know...
It's not, I studied Godzilla more than anyone on
this planet
And I say to you
that it is the only solution.
I think we should try it...
We have less than 24 hours before meltdown, can we afford
not to try it?
Do you have a better solution to try?
But, how do we get Destroyer to fight Godzilla?
Junior... We bring him to tokyo and Godzilla will follow
You cant be serious....
Junior is just little, we cant possibly expect him to...
Sentimentalism does not have its place It is 
the future which is concerned! Our priority is to prevent
the fusion of Godzilla.
With or without you I will modify his trajectory.
It is right, we should not forget There is not only Junior,
there is also Tokyo.
It is necessary to evacuate people in
a radius of 300 km around Tokyo.
-They want to attact Godzilla to Tokyo?
-Correct
What are they thinking?
Don't Die Junior
Hang in there!
Godzilla
Godzilla is in Tokyo Bay
So he's come..
He's moving forward!
-What's Happening?
-He's injecting the little one with Micro-Oxygen
to drain his energy
Junior is not going to last much longer...
He did it!
What's happening to Destroyer?
Something is happening inside the fire
-Look at Godzilla and Junior
-Theyre calling to each other
So thats the adult Destroyer, its so large.
-I think it's best if we leave this place
-Roger that sir
Destoroyah underwent a change.
The temperature of Godzilla
rise with 1141°C.
Sir, we have an emergency call from the news chopper.
I need air force assistance. I need them to send Super X3 at one!
Send Super X3?
When Godzilla melts, we might be able to limit the damage
but we will need to freeze him
As soon as his tempurature is right, we need to freeze him
for it to work.
ATS system ready!
-Are the cryo lasers armed?
-Yes sir, and they were just reloaded
Well then, lets go freeze us a lizard.
and get this over with
Afterburner activated
Super X3, Ready for liftoff
Good luck captain.
Thank you
Super X3...Take Off!
Destroyer is moving towards the bay.
What is it going to do?
JUNIOR!!!
Sir, we lostthe contact with the SC9.
What?
That's Miki's helicopter
Junior...
ju...
Junior....
Godzilla...is crying..
It can't understand why it lost it's child
I know this will be Godzilla's last battle
Destroyer is moving towards the SC9
-That's where Miki is
-Do we have another helicopter?
Negative
-The TV Chopper
-I'll try contacting them, no answer
Keep trying!
Come on sister, pick up
Godzilla's tempurature has reached critical
Sir, I have the TV Helicopter
Sister... do you read me?
-What a monster
-Not even the Oxygen Destroyer can defeat Godzilla
Come on, hold onto me!
Hurry
Come on hurry....
I see them
-There they are
-She's hurt
-I got her
-Come on we gotta get outta here
-Okay
Thats it
Pilot, take off right now
Gotcha
Ready
Prepare to fire as soon as it reaches 1200.
Super X3 on standby on 500 m.
The temperature in Godzilla has reached critical!
Godzilla is starting to meltdown
Cryo Lasers ready to fire
Destroyer has taken to flight
Ready sir.
Cryo Lasers, fire!
Destroyer is going to fall on top of Godzilla!
Godzilla is melting
Godzilla...
Meltdown
-Fire at will
-Cryo Lasers fire!
Lasers at maximum power
What radioactivity!
Godzilla is gone, it left Tokyo a ghost town.
We really ended up paying.
For what
Everything, all this missuse of nuclear energy.
My work with Godzilla is finished.
The radiation levels are dropping!
