Watch your step.
Thank you. Watch your step.
- Morning.
- Morning. Oh! Excuse me.
All set for the week
going to be busy.
Don't I know it.
- Hi, Patty, hi, Fay.
- Hi.
<font color=#FF00FF>*Ladies in Black*</font>
<font color=#ffff00>Sync corrections</font>  by  <font color=#00FF00>srjanapala</font>
- Good weekend?
- All right.
Frank take you out?
Took himself out.
He went fishing.
This is where
I'm going to start you off.
Strewth!
Look at that!
I think I might leave you with
these ladies you follow me.
I hope she's better than
the one we had last Christmas.
- Morning, Miss Cartwright.
- Morning, Miss Cartwright.
Miss Baines, Mrs Willams,
this is Miss Miles, um.
- L... Lisa.
- Lisa Miles
she'll be helping you out with
the Christmas rush and the sales.
Right, There we are.
These ladies will show you the ropes.
Right, then.
I hope you like hard work.
It's very nice to see you here.
Have a lovely day.
Have you, have you got a list”?
- Oh! I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- Sorry.
I was really hoping
you could adjust the darts.
I'm afraid we can only
do hems at the moment.
Oh! In the racks over there.
Make sure you arrange
them according to size.
Okay.
Would you have this
in an SW?
Oh, I'm not sure.
It's my first day.
Bloody staff don't know
anything these days.
Don't know
where they find them.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry, madam.
Ahem. Uh, Lisa!
Miss Miles!
Bucket and mop
please, dear.
In the storeroom.
Where did you meet him?
He works with Myra's boyiriend.
Reckoned he was irresistible.
I have I got news for him.
Ugh, he was all over me.
They only want one thing...
All of them.
Maybe not all of them.
What do you mean?
Onh.. Nothing...
Frank's just a bit...
Inattentive?
Just left school, have you, Lisa?
Done the inter, have you?
No, the leaving.
The leaving!
How old are you?
I'm sixteen...
I'll be seventeen in February.
I'd been working
in the shoe factory
for two years
when I was 16.
Are you going to be a teacher?
Oh, no.
What then?
I'm going to be a poet.
- A poet!
- A poet!
I don't reckon
there'd be much money in that.
Um, well, I mean, I'd like to try
to be a poet. Or... an actress.
- An actress!
- An actress!
Like at the Tivoli?
In the chorus line?
Well, no, no, I meant
more real theatre, you know...
Uh... Shakespeare,
Eugene O'Neill, Moliére...
Violly? who?
Never heard of her.
Mind your step.
Hey!
Good afternoon, ladies.
Beautiful day, is it not”.
How lucky we all are
to live in such a place.
Ah!
You must be the new jeune fille.
Soon you will come to me.
Some help I can use
during this season.
Who's that.
Magda. One of the moreffos.
Refugees. Migrants.
Comes out here and lords it
over us with some cock and bull story
about a fashion job
in Paris before the war.
Tell you what,
she looks all right, though...
Must be 45
if she's a day.
She's older than my mum.
Well, apart from those two
that boss me around,
there's a lady
called Miss Cartwright,
and a Mr Ryder
and a migrant called Magda.
"New Australians”,
we're supposed to call them.
- The other two don't like her.
- Why not?
I don't know.
They think she's a bossy boots.
Bossy boots...
well, I'm off.
How'd you go, love?
Good, dad.
Lots of carrying things.
Good for you. Build you up.
Have a look at you,
you're like an underfed canary.
All right!
See you in the morning.
- Bye.
- Hooroo.
This came for you.
Dad will have to sign this.
Doyou think he will?
We'll think of something.
It's not going to be easy,
put it's just a matter
of picking the right time.
- Mm.
- All right?
Your dad's all right. He...
Sometimes needs a bit of...
Careful handling?
Yeah.
Help me with this,
will you, dear?
Z1p that up for me,
will you?
It's...
Um... I, um...
I don't think it's going to fit.
Oh, nonsense.
I always wear this size.
Um, I don't...
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
- Undo... undo it!
- I don't...
- What did you do?
- I...
Now, now, Mrs Wentworth,
do try to hold still.
You better clear off,
we'll sort this out.
I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can see the problem.
- Aahh!
- Oh, Mrs Wentworth,
we've had so much trouble
with zippers lately.
They make them in Melbourne,
or Japan, or somewhere.
- Oh, there!
- Oh, thank you!
- What happeneq??
- The new assistant.
I know
it may be a bit unfair,
perhaps,
we should dismiss that young girl.
Mrs Wentworth will be
on the warpath.
Her family have shares
in Goode's, you know.
- Oh, I don't think she'll make a fuss...
- Mr Ryder.
She'll be a laughing stock
if word gets around
about what size dress
she was trying to squeeze into.
And word could get around,
I suppose, Miss Cartwright.
It could, Mr Ryder.
It could.
You don't ike the lunch room?
Oh... not too much.
It's nicer out here.
Must be a good book.
On, it is...
it's wonderful.
I'm just finishing it.
You can borrow it if you like.
It's pretty big, I dunno.
What's it called?
Anna Karenina.
Is it a romance?
I like romances.
Well. Sort of.
- Come on, we'd better get back.
- Oh, Yes.
It's um, it's by Tolstoy.
It's set in Russia.
- Russia!?
- Yeah!
- You can't read Russian.
- Oh, no, no, it's a translation.
- Oh!
- Yeah!
I'm sorry, but the fact is
that when I got it home
and tried it on, it just
wasn't really my colour.
It's just not me.
I see. Oh, Lisa,
those go by the lift.
- Okay.
- And. Uh,
what about the sales books
I asked you to check?
You've got to add
the totals page by page,
and then compare them
with the receipts.
Yes, I've done that.
- Oh!
- Miss? My dress?
Yes, well, you can exchange it,
madam, but not if it's been worn.
It hasn't been worn.
Very well.
Third floor for exchanges, madam.
- Liar.
- Of course.
Oh, look out. Here she comes...
Miss Croatia 1938.
Ladies.
Today is the day I am stealing
your little schoolgirl slave
- for a few hours.
- Oh, no, no, you're not.
Can't you see that
we're run off our feet?
Quite so, but we are
all our feet run off.
But Miss Cartwright has said
that we can keep Lisa all week!
I have cleared the matter
with Miss Cartwright.
Come, Lisa. I will show you
how we do things in model gowns.
Come!
Well, bugger that.
She knew we needed
the extra help this week.
Typical.
Thinks she owns the place.
Yeah. Typical.
Do you have this
in any other colours?
Certainly, maaam.
These frocks are all unique,
and are all
only by the best designers.
This, for example,
is Hardy Amies.
A customer wearing
one of these creations
knows that she will not meet
another wearing the same,
which is so terrible a thing
to happen to a woman.
You might find the same
frock at georges in Melbourne,
but, who goes to Melbourne?
And we do not keep different sizes
of the same model because?
Then the frock
wouldn't be unique?
Quite so.
This is perfect for one of
our younger society matrons,
perhaps, to attend
a Ball at the Trocadero.
It is by Elizabeth Arden.
The Americans are so modern.
This... I would like for myself,
it is so very well cut.
See the detail.
But I am not at my best
in the English style.
I cannot understand it,
but all English women are
made in shape of a pear.
Now the French... Jacques Fath,
uh, Chanel, the great dior,
cut to fit a woman
with bosoms and hips,
but they make her look slim
nevertheless, that is artistry.
I suppose
these are very expensive.
Expensive!
They are
fantastically expensive.
And such cost,
as you may one day appreciate,
is part of their charm.
Model gowns?
Well... I thought they were
all model gowns at Goode's.
Oh, no, most of them
are un-model gowns.
They come in all sizes
and anyone can buy them.
Anyway, no-one has
the same clothes you do
because I make them.
So theyre unique too,
aren't they?
I mean, just think of that
lovely pink frock I made you.
The one with the trills.
That's right, mum.
___
On, I... do, mum.
I was just thinking that
most of the model gowns
are... Evening frocks.
Ah... oh, well...
That's another story.
Well, I suppose I could
try my hand at that
if you wanted to go to a Ball.
Hm? Oh, you'd look just lovely.
You would.
Oh, thanks, mum.

Yeah, too right it was.

- Yeah?
Dad, I need you
to sign this form.
It's for a
commonwealth scholarship.
It I get it,
it means the government
will pay my fees
to Sydney University.
It's, it's just, just there.
Look! I've told you before.
No daughter of mine...
- Is going to university.
- That's right.
I know, dad, but...
Ea, she mightn't even
get the scholarship.
Just sign it for her school.

Oh! I knew I shoulant

University?
You didn't see me going

for anyone else.
I didn't use it all,
Mrs fairbrother
hope not!
Isn't this
wonderful, Bob, darling?
Yep. Hunky Dory!
I just love to dance with you.
I'd like to keep on
dancing with you forever.
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if we just kept on dancing
and dancing and never
did anything else?
We'd sure get tired!
Bob, you're so funny!
I can feel the muscles
in your arms.
I bet you could pick me up
and carry me out
as if I were a feather
I could carry 20 like you.
I don't want you to carry 20,
just me!
Oh, Bob,
I'd wish you'd carry me off
to some unknown green island.
Somewhere with palms
and coral and mermaids
and harps.
Wouldn't you just love it, Bob?
Thank you.
I drink this
only until they learn how
to make coffee in Australia
Lisa.
You've fallen in love.
C'est magnifique.
It's it's different.
Younger designer
but it's also too...
too small for these
big Australian girls.
How much is it?
One hundred and fifty guineas.
C'est bien,
if we do not sell it
before Christmas,
it will go on sale
at 75 guineas.
Seventy-five guineas!
Hm! 'est la vie.
There will be more dresses
Well, I don't see
any problem, Mrs Williams.
You seem completely healthy.
- Perhaps it's your husband.
- My husband?
Get him to come in
for an examination
- maybe it's him who's...
- No. He wouldn't like that.
No.
Well,
tell me... now often
do you have... relations?
- Relations!?
- Uh-huh.
Not that often.
He's tired sometimes.
Perhaps that's the problem.
With... without... proximity...
there's no chance of...
Heautiful cocktail dress
I'he changing rooms
are just, just behind you.
Oh, bloody hell.
What a day!
You did all right, Kia.
Didn't she?
Yes. She did all right, all right.
You're not buying something
from Goode's, are you?
It's too expensive.
- Staff discount.
- “What is it?
On, just a little thing.
Thought it might suit me.
Well, I never.
Frank!
I didn't hear you come in.
You're early.
Boss said to knock off early
to do some Christmas shopping.
Why are you dressed for bed?
It's only six o'clock.
It's new... the night-dress.
I'm just trying it on.
It didn't cost much,
not with the staff discount.
I take it off now.
I'll help ya...
take it off.
Tyger Tyger, burning bright,

we're busier than
a one-armed bricklayer.
Mrs Williams, Christmas is not
the best time for lateness.
Sorry, Miss Cartwright,
the alarm didn't go off.
It's the first time I've been late
since mum's hysterectomy.
Everything okay?
You look like the cat that
ate the cream, I must say.
Everything's fine.
I just overslept.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hhm.
You're with us today, remember?
No sneaking back
to Dracula's hideout.
I just thought he might
have got a bit of overtime.
He's not usually late.
He called up this afternoon.
Said he didn't feel too good.
- Oh... well...
- Look, don't worry, love.
I here'll be some explanation.
He's probably down
at the pub with a few mates.
Excuse me. Thank you.
Lisa.
Is the beast from the Balkans
trying to steal you again?
No, she's invited me
to lunch on Saturday.
With her and her husband
- she's got a husbana?
- Well, evidently!
Well, I hope you like
frog's legs and fish eyes
and sheep's testicles,
because those reffos
eat all kinds
of horrible things.
Oh! Find me a right foot,
will you? Thank you.
- Isn't it glorious?
- Mm-hmm.
- It's just lovely.
- Mm.
I am happy.
Be happy... always.
It's a good choice!
Lisa, may I present my husband,
Stefan Szombathelyi.
He's a Hungarian but not,
alas, a count.
But you can't have Everything.
Stefan, this is Lisa Miles.
My most capable junior
temporary sales assistant.
I am enchanted to meet you.
- Oh!
- Oh, Lisa.
I suppose you haven't heard
we Europeans are always kissing.
Some wine?
We have been amazing to discover
very fine Australian wine.
- Um..
- Oh, perhaps some lemonade.
- Oh, lemonade, yes.
- Thank you.
So, Lisa, tell me,
do you like to read novels?
Oh, yes, I do. I just
finished Anna Karenina
I haven't decided
what to read next.
There are so many
to choose from.
Oh, how true. And the number
always grows, I assure you.
Perhaps your next choice should
be something quite different.
Um... Emma.
Have you read that yet?
No, I haven't!
Oh, well, that is settled, then.
Jane Austen, I assure you,
is as great a genius as Tolstoy,
whatever they say.
You will let me have your
opinion in due course, yes?
Yes, I will.
Oh!
That will be Rudi.
Such a sense of timing. Like no-one.
Yes.
Lisa, put more.
- More?
- Yes.
Ah... lunch time...
I have such a sense of timing.
Like no-one.
But... I have brought a cake.
So, tell us, Rudi, we've
been discussing Jane Austen.
- Ah...
- What do you think of her?
Well, my opinion
has yet to be formed,
- as I have not read one word.
- Ah, a philistine!
No, the truth is I am rather
infatuated with Charles Dickens
you see, he is much better in English
than he is in Hungarian.
So, I am reading again
what I read so long ago.
Dickens in serpo-croat
I never read and I don't care.
His books are stupendously long.
What was he thinking?
I don't have time!
- Magda prefers vogue.
- Vogue and Agatha Christie too.
That's true.
Tell me, what do you think?
- Hm?
- Of the cake.
Oh, it's wondertul.
I must say that in Melbourne,
where I have been living,
there are many better
cake shops than Sydney.
In Melbourne,
they have more need of cake,
having more or less
nothing else.
Mum?
- So what's going on?
- Out with it!
Frank's disappeared.
I knew something was up.
Since when?
He din't come home on Thursday.
He wasn't at work on Friday.
They don't know
where he is, either.
I called the police,
and they said not to worry.
They said
people do it all the time.
That I should call it
he's not back in a week.
- You two have a fight?
- No!
Well, I dunno... he was always
a bit on the peculiar side.
I know. You and Dawn and Joy
you didn't... you don't like him!
I've never said that.
But you wouldn't call him a livewire.
He's just shy. Thats all.
Growing up on the farm.
He didn't have anyone to talk to.
He's always been very...
Inhibited.
Listen, Patty...
I'll tell you this.
No-one understands men.
We don't understand them and
they don't understand themselves.
They do these stupid things.
But they always come back,
in the end.
They can't really manage
by themselves, men can't.
He'll be back...
Or he'll have me to answer to.
S0, may I”? I was just...
I was just wondering
how it would look
if we tried this.
They love to talk in
their barbaric Hungarian.
I thought you were Hungarian.
Me? No.
I am Slovenian.
I suppose you do not know
what it is, Slovenian?
Can you take it oft?
Yes, I do! Ah,
Slovenia is part of Yugoslavia.
The capital city is Jubliana.
You are a genius. No!
I never met before an Australian
who had even heard of this place!
Stefan and I, we met not
in Europe, but in Australia.
In one of your migrant camps.
Not such a lovely place,
but... it was paradise after
what we had been through.
I see.
Hm. Stefan and I, we met
learning English together.
We can speak German, but...
it's not our favourite language.
There it's much better.
Lisa...
can you see without your glasses?
Oh, yes, I only really
need them for reading.
So, why do you wear them always?
I suppose because
I am always reading.
Can we take them off?
Yes.
You have beautiful eyes.
So, one last thing...
Lipstick, I think...
It's a nice pink...
And you can keep it.
It's suitable for a jeune fille.
You have so slim a figure.
Hold on.
I envy you this much.
You should make the most of it.
There, turn around.
You look charming.
And with a bit more experience,
Lisa, you could be enchanting.
How do you feel?”
Different.
Hello, mum! Look!
Lesley, I thought you told us
you'd be home by four o'clock.
Oh, Magda gave me this
and this belt, do you like it?
- Well... um, goodness...
- I'm sorry I'm late,
but we went for a walk and Magda
told me about Slovenia before the war.
Oh! And we talked about books
and Stefan made us
a lovely lunch.
Who's Stefan?
He's Magda's husband.
On, right... he made the lunch?
European men like to cook.
Oh! uh,
I didn't know that.
I like to drink.
I'm off to the pub.
See you in a couple of hours.
Uh, Lesley, I had a telephone
call from that Magda.
That Mrs Zombie
something or other...
to say you were on your way
which was very nice of her
but, um, she tried to tell me
that your name was Lisa.
She didn't seem
to know your name.
Uh... well, that's what
they call me at Goode's.
What do you mean?
Your name is Lesley.
But I don't like Lesley.
But that's your name. Lesley!
But I want to be Lisa.
And I will be and I am!
Lisa?
How do you think it feels
to have your own child
telling you that she wants
a different name?
What's wrong with “Lesley?”
Lesley's a lovely name.
Oh, mum... I just... I just
wanted a real girl's name.
‘Lesley' is a boy's name.
No, Lesley's a girl's name too,
it's spelt differently.
But it sounds the same,
and that's what counts.
I just wanted a proper girl's name
for when I grow up.
I've been a child
for so long now.
I just want to be grown up.
Oh, Lesley...
If you only knew what
being grown up can be like...
You wouldn't... wish it to
be any faster than it is.
Oh, mum.
Please don't cry, mum.
Yeah... I suppose I always
knew that I'd lose you some day.
Oh, no, you'll never lose me.
I'll stay with you always.
But you can't say that,
sweetheart
because you'll marry,
you'll go abroad.
You can't stay with me always...
I'm just being selfish,
I suppose.
No, you're not.
Even if I do marry or go away,
I'll still come and see you.
- Often.
- Well, I hope so.
Of course I will
and you can keep on
calling me Lesley, if you like.
I'll see
I might manage to call you Lisa
sometimes, but that depends.
Right, but now something more
important, your dad's dinner.
You know, that belt
does look very nice on you.
I hope you thanked
Magda properly for that.
Of course I did.
Your little Australian
schoolgirl is most charming.
I can see you are going to turn
a sow's ear into a silk purse.
Hm?
If I do a good deed for once in
my life I cannot see the humour.
Perhaps she reminds
me the little of..
- Of?
- Myself... before the war.
Really”?
I find that hard to believe.
- She's so...
- Innocent... and naive, I know.
Do you think I was always
tres sophistiquée?
Well... yes.
I can assure you
that's not the case.
- Stefan.
- Mm-hm?
This is most odd.
When I called Lisa's mother,
she didn't seem to know
the name of her own child.
‘Lesley' she pronounces it.
T'his Australian speech
is very bizarre.
What can be expected?
They're the
descendants of convicts,
their accent comes from
the lower classes of England.
‘Lesley... Lesley... ‘lesley?
‘Lesley', "Lesley".
‘Lesley.'
Espresso.
Ah.
On! It's only place in town
with decent coffee
owned by?
"Russian reffos.
A relative of the Tsar, they say.
- Am?
- From the court of st Petersburg
to pitt street in Sydney. Now,
I only have 20 minutes. What?
- Rudi needs assistance.
- Oh!
I wish to find a girlfriend.
I know very few people
here in Sydney.
I look to you
and Stefan for help.
Uh, hmm.
Well, I can think of
no-one at the moment.
I think you have to
arrange this for yourself.
I am not fussy.
No, you want only a beauty,
less than thirty years old,
cultivated, if not also rich.
Certainly I will want a beauty.
Cultivated, well,
I have... heard there is
such a thing, but...
What do you mean?
Naturally, we are cultivated,
we reffos, we "new Australians.
We are famous for it!
It's our most despicable quality.
Oh, no, you misunderstand me.
This time I am not
looking for a reffo.
I want an Australian girl.
An Australian!
Some of them are very beautiful.
Have you not noticed?
Yes.
The cultivated ones
have gone away.
- They've gone away.
- Uh-huh.
Where have they gone”?
They have-They 've gone away to London,
sometimes they go to Paris...
Spasiba.
To Paris or New York, Rome.
- Hm.
- And if you find one here...
She is saving her fare,
I guarantee it.
Well, then
I shall take an uncultivated
one and cultivate her myself.
But a nice, strong, healthy,
available Australian girl.
Well, I can think of no-one
with all of these qualifications.
Maybe you should give
yourself a thought, hm?
Yes?
What are you doing
for Christmas?
Oh, I don't know.
I might go to Melbourne,
to my brother's.
Melbourne? I thought
you said his wife was a cow.
Yeah, she is.
She doesn't do a thing!
She's got legs
like tree trunks too.
Why don't you come
to the Blue Mountains?
Mum and dad
have retired up there.
- Yeah, that might be nice...
- Thanks.
Then there's always a good new
year Eve's party at the Hydro.
- Oh, I forgot, you're oft blokes.
- No, I'm not, just... some blokes.
Look, what are
we going to go to?
Um.
I reckon the Nun's story.
Audrey Hepburn, she's gorgeous.
God, it look serious.
Can't we see something funny?
Oh! I'm all right Jack.
What about that?
Ugh, I don't know.
On ine beach, Gregory peck!
Oh, he's divine!
Oh... he really is.

Magda.
My mother sent you some scones.
And I told her that you probably
wouldn't like them but, um...
I love scones.
Oh!
That is... really, really kind.
Please thank your mother.
Very kindly. May I wish you and
your family happy Christmas.
Now, Lisa, perhaps you can
help me with a small problem.
Rudi has decided that he wants
an Australian girlfriend.
No! No, don't worry, not you.
Oh, no, no...
Um... you are much too
young and too clever for him.
No, someone older and
perhaps not too particular.
Magda... there is someone.
Oh, no, not Miss cartwrignt!
Lisa, this is not
what he has in mind.
No. Not Miss Cartwright, no.
[Bright orchestral musicl.
Hmm.
Yeah.
She is about thirty or less,
but not bad.
She's rough. She has no style.
Perfect!
It's been
a wonderful effort once again.
Another record Christmas
forGoode's, I'm sure.
Congratulations.
Thank you all very much.
And Happy Christmas!
Happy Christmas!
- Well... another year gone.
- Yes.
My life slowly ticks away
at Goode's.
Merry Christmas,
Miss Cartwright.
Merry Christmas, Mr Ryaer.
I suppose you'll spend it
with your family?
Oh, yes.
My dear mother passed away
this year, as you know.
But I have some
delightful nephews
I shall spend
the festive season with.
Miss Baines.
Ah, I would be really charmed if
you would join my husband and I
on new year's Eve
at our flat in Mosman.
Me? New Year's Eve?
There will be many people,
and Lisa will be there.
Ah, so you will not feel
like a complete stranger.
Oh, but I might be
in the Blue Mountains
for New Year's Eve. So...
So, I believe they have trains.
You do your best.
Here it's address
oh, Rudi... here's your healthy
Australian girl. Poor lamb.

All right, Lesley,
you're champing at the bit,
so dwway you go.
Okay... um, this one is for you, mum.
Thank you, sweetie.
And, dad,
I believe this one is for you.
- On, thanks, love.
- All right.
And so, this one must be for me?
- Yes, the big one's yours.
- Great!
Lisa?
Oh, they smell
beautiful. Thank you.
No worries, mum.
[Mr Milesl Aw...
The Australian Bloodhorse!
It's great, love, thank you!
It's great!
Oh...
What, don't you like it”?
Of course I do, mum, um...
I was just wondering
about the colour.
Oh, but you've always loved
pink. And these frills.
Ever since you were
a little girl, you've loved them.
Yes, yes, that's right, mum.
It's terrific. Really.
Good.
Well, I suppose you'll both be
wanting something from me now.
It's a bit hard for me
to go Christmas shopping
when I work all night
and sleep all day.
Hang on...
What have I got here?
Come over here, dari.
- There you go, sweetheart.
- Thanks, dad.
Pleasure.
Sweetheart?
- Thanks, Ed.
- No worries.
Well... what do you say we
go down to manly for a swim
before we go to aunty Gert's?
Huh! What do you reckon?
Sounds good?
- Yep!
- Sounds good to me!
Go! Go! Go! G0!
Ooh!
Oh! The pessimist sees
difficulty in every opportunity,
the optimist sees opportunity
in every difficulty."
Beautiful!
Oh, come on, pat. What's it say?
“Laugh and the world
laughs with you.
Weep and you weep alone.”
What's wrong with aunty Patty?
- I think she's crying.
- Is she really?
Pat?
Auntie Patty's not feeling well.
Bad luck, Frank
having to be away.
Bit of a dark horse, that Frank.
Frank's not a dark horse.
Frank's a dill!
- At least we know one thing.
- What?
It couldn't be another woman.
He's no Casanova.
Come on, mother.
Just a little bit
of Christmas cake.
I got it at goode's!
Come on.
Have another one!
I would like to propose
a toast to this country.
Hm..
I still cannot believe my fate.
To the
commonwealth of Australia!
To Australia!
It is so beautiful here.
It really is...
- Are you happy?
- Oh, of course not.
What a very vulgar suggestion.
- Are you?
- Oh, dear, I hope not.
I'm not saying that I'm going.
I'm just thinking about it.
It's a bloody mad laea.
What's that, dear?
Oh, Fay's thinking about going
to a new year's do in Sydney.
On, that's a bit of a trip, dear.
Thank you.
We're going to the Hydro!
Remember?
Who's going to be at Magda's party”?
Are you meeting someone?
No! I don't know anyone.
I think they'll all be continentals.
Continentals!
Gosh, it's getting worse!
They'll all be jjabbering on,
you won't know what they're saying.
One of them might be a count,
you never know.
- A count?!
- Yeah, like...
I wouldn't count on that.
- I mean like count Ronsky.
- What's wrong with Australians?
So, Lisa, please pay attention.
Because of the new year parties,
a lot of ladies will be
coming in asking for dresses
at the sales prices...
before the sales
and you'll let them have them?
Not on your life.
But in model gowns...
Always polite.
You can say...
"No, madame,
I regret it is not possible.”
and, "I am so sorry."
Then they buy it,
not to look cheap.
- Every time.
- Is that still here?
Yeah, so... maybe it will
be in the sale. Half price.
- Seventy five guineas.
- Perhaps you have a rich uncle?
I'm afraid not.
So, mum, what about the collar?
Can we take that out too?
- Well... yes.
- Yes?
And don't you think
a belt would be nice?
Oh, yes, a belt might be nice.
Yeah!
Just here. Um
but... what about the frills?
I'm not too sure about...
No, but you've
always loved the frills.
Of course! Of course I like them,
I was just...
There's a lot of detail
in those frills
yes, but they do make the dress
a bit long, don't you think?
It's just, it might be
a bit too long for me, yeah?
We could maybe take it up a bit?
- Yeah!
- Yeah?
All right, we'll take it up.
♪ Just let me hear some
of that rock'n'roll music. ♪
Lisa!
Oh, let me admire you!
Oh, you look charming
this Evening!
- Welcome, Lisa! Have some punch.
- Thank you!
- I made it myself!
- Oh!
I think you try it at least
just once in your life.
But be careful,
he put atom bomb in it!
Ohh, okay!
Come and meet.
- Eva! Eva and Laszlo...
- Nice to meet you.
And their son Miklos... Michael, Michael,
as he's insisting we call him.
- Hi!
- He's proper Australian.
And he's even forgetting
his Hungarian.
- Miklos, this is Lisa.
- Hi!
I hear you've just
done the leaving.
- Yes.
- Magda told me, of course.
She said you're a great help
at the fashion store
she is my tower of strength.
She is clever, huh!
She's going on to
do great things.
I've just done it too.
You leaving.
- Oh, yes.
- Are you going to university?
I, I don't know...
Results in nine days.
- Yeah, nine days.
- Yeah!
Fay! you look beautiful!
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry I'm a bit late,
I had to catch
3 trains from the...
You came to my home.
- No, it's really delightful.
- Ah, so, who do you know?
- No-one.
- No, Lisa!
Lisa!
Yes, I know Lisa.
- Ah, this is sandor.
- Hello
and Maria and uh, Bela, uh,
and there is Stefan
but uh, he's deadly,
he's handing out atom bombs.
Um, here's Lisa, here's Lisa.
- Hi!
- How are you?
So let her talk to Miklos,
who is called Michael
uh, this is Rudi,
he's Hungarian.
Rudi! This is Fay,
she is Australian girl,
not a refugee from Europe.
Uh, do you...
Do you speak English?
Of course.
And Hungarian and German.
And some French and Russian.
A drink'?
Can you give me some punch'
I have some catching up to do.
Mlatchmaking is a strain.
The serbs and the croats
are not yet fighting.
Lisa is talking to Miklos.
Michael, Michael!

Lesley... Lisa, we've been worried.
Why, mum?
Well it's so late.
- Mum, it's New Year's Eve.
- Yes, I know.
But with people we don't know,
your dad's been anxious.
- Too right!
- Who brought you home?
- Mr Foldes.
- Just him?
No, mum, his wife and son
were there too.
Foldes!
What kind of name is that?
Theyre Hungarians, dad.
Hungarian'? God, country's
full of bloody foreigners!
But, dad, we all came here
from Europe sometime.
Crikey! Here we go.
Now I'm getting a history lesson, am I?
Now, you better get to bed, Lisa.
- Get some sleep.
- Yes, all right, mum.
I should have gone
to mass this morning.
Oh!
Too late now.
Well, there is a midday mass.
Aah!
I need some rest.
I'm sure God will understand.
- Stefan.
- Hm?
I think perhaps in one year,
maybe one year and a half,
we must look for premises
in woollahra.
Even better - double bay.
European fashions, huh?
Exclusive fashions, expensive.
Goode''s doesn't know
the meaning of the word.
- Sorry!
- That's quite all right.
- 1 thank you.
- Thank you.
- Rudi?!
- Huh?
- Are you looking for a frock?
- Of course!
What do you think,
this one suits me?
Yeah!
Rudi, you can't stay here.
Miss Cartwright will have a fit
in fact, my dear Lisa, I wish
to speak a few words to Fay.
Oh, she's gone to morning tea.
Oh, wait, there she is.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Fay, I've came to ask if you will
risk an outing with a “reffo”.
On Friday night.
Please think about it.
On, I... don't need
to think about it.
Then I will call you
on Thursday night.
On, no, no phone calls. My landlady,
she's a real old battleaxe.
Don't worry, I will smother her
in middle European charm.
Soon she will be looking
forward to my calls.
Oh well.
I should, um.... oh, sorry.
Oh!
It has been a madhouse here.
Did I see that Hungarian wolf
prowling around?
I think he's asked Fay out.
Well, I have something to say
but I don't want to translate it.
It's still there.
But I won't be responsible
if you rob a bank to buy it.
And it could sell,
very soon, at 50 guineas.
Oh, please don't say that.
Please don't sell it.
Lisa, that is a promise
I could never make.
Fifty pounds for
a dress! I've never spent...
Guineas. 50 guineas. That's
50 pounds, 50 shillings.
On, that's even worse.
You could buy ten dresses for that.
- Not like this one, mum.
- Oh, I don't know, Lesley.
- Lisa.
- Lisa
I don't know what's happening
to you. It's that Magda.
Now someone called Michael's
called you up. Now, who's he?
Get the oven door, will you?
Ah, he's a boy.
Just done the leaving.
- His father drove me home on...
- Oh, yes, on new year's Eve.
But you said he was Hungarian.
He sounded Australian.
Well, he was born here.
Oh, well, in that case,
I suppose he is Australian.
I suppose so.
Get me a Sherry,
will you in the cabinet, in there.
- So, who was that director?
- Réné clément. Really charming.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just, it's so sad.
I've never seen
the French film before.
Then I have arrived
just in time to rescue you.
We will see them all,
les enfants du paradis,
la regle du jeu, pépé le moko.
Are they all sad?
No, not at all,
some are most amusing.
Perhaps this wasn't
a good choice.
No, no, no, no, it was.
I loved it.
The Nazis conscripted me
when they occupied Hungary.
They had me work
the railway lines.
Not at all... pleasant.
I escaped to Romania
and hid there
for the remainder of the war.
How is the goulash?
- Oh, it's delicious. Go on.
- Uh!
After the war,
I was a bureaucrat in Budapest.
Huh! What a line...
I should, I should write a song.
But... the communists were no
improvement on the Nazis...
So... I escaped to the
evil capitalist west...
..during the uprising in 1956.
On, I've heard of that.
First Italy, then England
and now Australia.
This is where I intend
to make money.
This is...
The country of opportunity.
Perhaps I am to be...
Ausralia's first Hungarian
ex-communist mir...
List.
Tell me, do you prefer list to
Mozart or Beethoven to both?
I'm not sure.
Well, I will take care of that,
if you will permit me.
You are very musical or you
could not dance so well
what about books?
Oh, I've just finished
reading Anna Karenina.
Lisa lent it to me.
Remarkable. I have found
an Australian intellectual
and Magda told me
they were all in England.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, dear.
Fay... Fay!
Ee, look at that.
Looks like he just wandered
in from the sheep show.
Oh, Patty!
On, darling!
No, please, move away,
we must attend to this lady.
She's my wife!
Oh. Gracious.
Well, it's good that you're here.
You can take her home.
Patty, can you hear me??
I have sal volatile.
It never fails.
[Fayl just nice and slow.
Go to hell!
Now, now, now, shh.
You've had a shock. Just be quiet.
Tell him to go to hell.
Yeah, I've been to hell.
I've just got back, but
I couldn't find my key.
Gotta get my house keys off va.
- Fainted?
- Uh-huh.
Right in the miadle
of ladies' cocktails.
- Her husband was there, too.
- What was he doing there?
I don't know.
Well, that sounds
very odd to me.
I wonder why she
hasn't had children
- you should see her husband.
- Now, Lesley...
Lisa...
What do you know about that?
Well, he's completely gormiess.
Yes, well, so are lots of men.
But it doesn't stop them
from becoming fathers.
Well, I grew up
in Bendigo, in Victoria.
But my dad died when I was 11
in the war in new Guinea, so...
We moved around
a lot after that.
I had to leave school as soon
as I turned 15 and find a job.
So.
You Australians are
a mysterious people.
No-one would guess
that this is a place
that people can also suffer.
It is the constant sunshine.
It hides Everything but itself.
- Where have you been?
- Wagga.
Wagga?
Wagga Wagga”.
Yeah,
Wagga Wagga.
Phil O'Connell remember him?
He was always
asking me to go down
and give him
a hand with the pub.
So I thought...
Over Christmas, New Year's.
You didn't bother telling me,
of course
I'm only your wife.
I wouldn't worry, would 1?
I wouldn't have to go tell
lies for you at Wonda's Tiles,
or turn up at Goode's
feeling sick and terrible!
And why are you
back now, anyway?
I suppose you ran out
of clean shirts!
Well, I tell you what...
You can clean your own
bloody shirts from now on!
I'm sorry. I should've thought.
Just had my mind
on other things.
Yeah?!
Like what, for instance?!
I just felt... after that night,
you know, you...
I thought you wouldn't want
to see me again, for a while.
That night”?
With the night dress?
Yeah.
Oh.
- Frank.
- Yeah!
That's what's
been bothering you?
Yeah.
- That's why you shot through?
- Yep.
- Frank...
- Yeah?
That was wonderful...
That night...
I just thought... you know,
the way I carried on, it was...
- A bit...
- It was wonderful.
- You know what”?
- What?
I am so hungry.
Vwhy don't you go down the street
and get us some fish and chips?
I'll call mum when you're out.
And don't be long...
I'm starving!
Yeah, well, all right then.
So that was okay, that night”?
I'll say it was!
We have heard nothing from Rudi.
I wonder why.
Well... he is obviously
engaged elsewhere.
Correct. Did you see who
he left the party with?
- The prettiest girl”?
- The Australian girl. Fay.
Fay is an adult.
She can look after herself.
She is a naive Australian girl,
experienced no doubt only
with clumsy Australian men.
And Rudi is a wolf
of a different colour.
This is melodrama.
The reality probably is that
both are at a loose end
it suits them for the time
being to see each other.
For a woman, it is never
only for amusement.
I'he heart is engaged,
so it may be broken.
And it will be my fault.
Nonsense.
You merely introduced them.
Now the ball is in their court.
Hm? You are crossing the bridge
before the horse has bolted.
Magnificent!
Such a wonderful country...
and so empty!
We must keep
its existence a secret,
or all those bloody reffos
will come racing down
here from Europe.
Now for one of your...
Famous sandwiches.
Mm!
Not bad!
Are they different from
continental sandwiches?
Yes...
But the principle is the same.
What are you thinking?
Oh, nothing... nothing much.
Well, you remember I was going
to tell you the rest of my story.
- Your disgraceful past.
- Yes.
- Am I going to be shocked?
- I think so.
Proceed, shock me.
Well, when I was about 10,
I wanted to be a ballet dancer
but my mother had no money
for proper lessons, so...
Um, when I was about 16,
I ended up in this... nightclub.
- Horrible.
- Yes.
And after a while I, um...
I met this man, Mr Marlow...
And, um, he was a businessman.
He was older at least 45.
He rented a flat for me...
in kings cross...
And, um... and he would visit...
and
were you in love
with this Mr Marlow?
Oh, no.
And does this Mr Marlow
still feature in your life?
Believe me, Fay...
The pope in Rome
does not have me high on the list
being considered for sainthood.
Magnificent!
Six, seven, eight!
And out, in, hip!
Hip! Hip! Step, cross, shoulders,
and around!
And flick!
Jump, kick, step, step!
And one!
Step, lunge, straight line!
Diagonal! And around!
First group!
Personalities!
Big finish! And slow!
- Thank you, ladies!
- Okay, girls.
I suppose it could be worse.
Take a break!
Another run-through at six.
So I think it was good
at the top
- this time. But, um,
- Okay.
The middle section
needs a little bit of work.
Ah, want the old job back, Fay?
Not right now, Gerald.
- That was good, darling.
- Thanks!
So, how are things
with your continental?
- Good.
- What's his name?
- Rudi Janosi.
- How do you spell it?
An j-a-n-o-s-i
what?
Well, he could change it,
you know.
Quite a few of them do that.
Rud won't.
Rudi says the best thing to do
if there's anything unusual
about you is to...
Brazen it out
you want to be careful.
You haven't known him long.
I don't want to see you get hurt.
I'd rather be hurt by Rudi
than the types I used to know.
Well, at least with an Australian
you know where you are.
Well, that's not too hot
if you don't want to be there.
At least with a continental
you're going somewhere new.
Yes. And it could be dangerous.
Life is dangerous.
You should hear
some of Rudi's stories.
We live in a cocoon here.
We don't know
how lucky we are.
I'll bet he knows
how lucky he is.
He put the hard word on you yet?
No.
- Do you love him, Fay?
- Yes, I reckon I do.
Come here.
I can't eat a thing.
- Lisa?
- Hm?
Have you found that
one in madam's size yet?
Um...
No, we don't seem to have it.
That girl's off with the pixies.
- Oh, you know why?
- No, why?
Why, her exam results
come out tomorrow
well, tonight if she goes down
to the herald building about 11.
Here you are, madam.
Hey, ed, haven't you got a girl
that's just done the leaving?
Yeah.
Well, they ve finished
setting the results.
Get your tall down there.
Have a look, see how she went.
I'll look after this for a bit.
- Oh, no need to bother, mate.
- Don't be a spoilsport.
Look, I'll go and check for you.
It's a big day for her.
- What school was it?
- She goes to North Sydney Girls.
Oh.
Sorry, excuse me.
Sorry, excuse me.
1 got four A's and a B!
- Is her name Lesley?
- Yeah!
Listen to this!
Five A's and first-class honours
in English and history.
That sounds all right,
doesn't it?
Jeez, you re a cool one, ed.
It's bloody great,
that's what it is!
Yeah! Huh! Well,
I should get back to work.
I hear your daughter's
distinguished herself famously!
Congratulations!
Wonderful news!
Good on you, mate!
I suppose she'll be
off to Sydney uni?
You must be very proud, ed.
- Yeah, well...
- Nice one, ed!
I'm not sure about that,
I'm not sure about the university.
Well, surely you wouldn't
waste brains like that
Ana you tell her to come and
see us if she wants a cadetship.
Congratulations, mate.
But first,
university's the thing.
Both my girls are there.
Having the time of their life.
What do va reckon, ed?
Someone in the family's
got some brains, hey?!
Thanks, mate.
- Mum!
- I know. Your father telephoned.
Oh, gosh!
What did he say?
Well, nothing much.
He was suffering from shock
or he wouldn't have phoned.
Oh, Lesley... Lisa!
This is the proudest day of my life!

in all creation, you know?
You must never forget that.
So you go to university...
and don't pass up
any opportunities.
You just go away and
be as clever as you can.
It's the best thing you
could possibly do...
You and all the clever girls
in this city and the world.
Now, we'd better get on and sell
some cocktail frocks, hadn't we?
Now, Lesley, I can't see
what you want with these exams
and first-class honours
and universities being a qirl.
But still... congratulations...
You've done very well.
Thanks, dad.
So, what do you want to do now?
You know what I want to do.
Well, I'll think about it...
If you get that scholarship.
Oh, she'll get it all right,
with that pass.
Well, if you do, I'll think about
you going to university, okay?
But, if I do decide you can go,
I don't ever want to hear
you mixed up with these...
Libertarians and those bloody
communists they've got there,
you'll be out of this house
in a shot, understood?
Yes, dad.
- Telephone rings]
- Oh, I'll get it.
What's this?
On! That's, uh, salami.
Lisa suggested it.
All those bloody reffos
she's got to know.
Hun! Salami, en?
Eeckon I could get used to that.
We out of beer?
No, Lisa suggested that too.
Huh!
It was Michael Foldes.
Who's he”?
What does he want?
He passed the exams too.
He wanted to know if I'm
doing anything tonight.
Well, of course you are!
We're going out to
celebrate, aren't we?
A slap-up meal in Chinatown.
What do ya reckon?
- Oh, dad!
- Crikey.
It's hard to keep
up with you, Lesley!
- Lisa!
- Lisa. Oh, God, what next?!
And have a look at ya.
Just have a look at ya.
Not bloody bad, hey!
Not bad.
Fay!
- Sorry!
- That's alright.
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.
I want your expert opinion.
You see...
There are harbour views
maybe you will
dislocate your neck,
but there are harbour views.
What do you think?
Well, I think it's...
I think it's really lovely.
But it's you who
has to like it it's.
I mean, it's your flat.
What do you think?
Oh, you... misunderstand me...
Oh, you mean...
You mean it's for me.
- Just like Mr Marlow, I, un...
- Fay...
- I stay here Ana you...
- Fay.
- You visit and...
- Fay! Don't be bloody silly!
Not like Mr bloody Marlow!
There, don't I sound like
a true Australian?
- No"?
- No.
No, this is for you.
For me. For. Us.
I want you to marry me.
- Marry?
- Marry.
Marry me”!
But I... I, I mean, I dont,
I don't know anything about...
- Books, or m-music, or a-art or...
- Bugger that, Fay!
- Opera or...
- Fay, Fay, Fay, you're honest.
And sweet and beautiful,
and I'm going to...
love teaching you all
about back and Mozart,
and I love you!
I adore you.
Think about it for
as long as you like.
I will give you
five minutes at least
- shall I leave you alone...
- No., no, no, no! Don't leave me.
the answer... is yes!
- Yes, I will!
- Yes!
Yes!
- That was Rudi on the telephone.
- Oh?
He wants to borrow
50 pounds from me.
Oh... why?
Oh, he wants to buy a
diamond ring, or a sapphire.
On, is he going into
the jewellery business?
Mm I don't think so.
He wants to buy an
engagement ring for Fay.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!
- Uh... engagement ring for Fay?
- Uh-huh... yeah.
Stefan...
Could you pour me a whiskey?
All right!
The whole thing is preposterous.
How can they possibly
be happy together?
Hey have absolutely
nothing in common.
At all
well, having things in common
is not a condition
for a happy marriage.
The point is that they are
happy together.
It's only the beginning.
The middle and the end must
take care of themselves
at least he has not
been trifling with her.
Not breaking her heart
as I feared
but he could do, in future.
I'm happy for them.
I wish them well
- still something of a shock.
- Well.
One's friends can be shocking.
It's one of their
appealing features.
It 1s not here.
Never let sentiment
interfere with business.
To be sentimental about
business is to be weak,
and to be weak is to tail.
Do you understand'.
- Yes, I suppose I do.
- Yeah.
So a man came to buy
a present for his daughter.
And he liked
the dress very much.
- So...
- So he got it for 50 guineas.
I had given the dress to Yvonne,
to be wrappea...
And he was telling me how happy
it would make his daughter.
- And...
- And?
And I told him that Yvonne had
made a big mistake and, um...
That the dress haa
already been sold.
And never again will sentiment
interfere with business
I swear it!
Here it is.
Oh, but, but Magda,
it's still 50 guineas and...
I don't have that much money.
Miss Cartwright
came here yesterday,
and she reduced all the
unsold dresses even further.
- To?
- Thirty five guineas.
Oh, Magda!
Thirty five guineas?
1 have, um, the ten from dad,
and my savings and the staff
discount... I have 35 guineas!
Perhaps you will be a business
woman. There are worse things.
Everything seems to be going
smoothly, Miss Cartwright.
True, Mr Ryder, but we'll soon be
losing half of ladies cocktail.
Really? Well...
Young Lisa will be off
to Sydney university,
but we always knew
she was only a temp.
Correct, but... Mrs Williams.
- Whispersl expecting.
- Expecting?
She doesn't look...
How do you know?
Years of observing
ladies in black, Mr Ryder.
And. Uh, Miss Baines...
- Yes?
- She's engaged!
- To a Hungarian.
- Hm!
She's given us a month's notice.
There's still Mrs Symbo...
Mrs. Sym... Magda.
That little boutique
is worth its weight in gold.
Don't count on her being
around too long, Mr Ryder.
I've heard she's looking
for premises of her own.
On, well...
It's not surprising, I suppose.
Ah, well,
they come and they go.
At least... there's you and me,
Miss Cartwright.
We're always here.
We're the constant ones.
Ahh, sorry, thank you.
Please...
Welcome come in!
[Mrs Milesl Thank you,
very much. Thank you.
Ah, wonderful,
come in, come in.
Oh...
So lovely to finally meet you!
- Yeah hi!
- Welcome!
- Hi! You look lovely.
- Thank you!
Lisa! Oh, so beautiful,
it looks so wonderful on you.
- Well, I suppose it does.
- Too right it does.
Thank you!
- So, can we please sit?
- Yes, please!
- Please!
- Take a chair.
- Here, take this.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- I think you're there.
So, I have
arranged a few delicacies.
Well, I believe that
I arranged them.
Well, you did. But I arranged
that you arranged them.
Eva, can you do the honours?
- Can you do the honours?
- Of course!
- Ah, thank you!
- Yes.
I know what they are,
they're olives.
Fay...
I have to tell you something...
We are going to be very rich,
and have lots of children.
At least four.
Is that all right with you?
Yes of course it's.
- I have found the perfect place.
- Hm?
It's...
In the middle of double bay.
"Magda''s fashions".
What do you say?
What can I say?
It is so appropriate!
I want to show
these Australian ladies
the meaning of the word "style".
And “expense?,
I'm sure!
Oh, forgive me, Mr Miles,
for being inattentive.
Oh, no worries, mate.
Oh, and it's ed.
- Ed?
- Yeah, ed.
Ed, Stefan.
- Stefan?
- Mm-bhhm_
Stefan.
This tastes great, what is it?
- Oh, duck liver pate.
- Sorry?
Duck liver.
Duck liver?
Hm. Strewtn!
Just won't think about it
if I can take everything
else that's been happening
I guess I can take
"duck liver", I suppose.
No more lemonade, Lisa.
In Hungary, you'd have
been drinking this for years.
In moderation, of course.
Now, cheers!
- So, um. Engineering?
- Engineering, that's right.
And you?
Arts of course
Lisa, when you finish university,
what will you be?
Um...
I'm going to be an actress...
Or a poet... or a novelist...
Or maybe all three!
