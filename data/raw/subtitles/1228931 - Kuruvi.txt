Cuddapah - Andhra.
Escape.
No...
They tried to escape.
Singamuthu, you are an elder.
Don't you have any concious.
Look at their state.
This place is surrounded
by a 2 km. electric fence.
My boys with guns.
I've recruited them like any army.
All this for what?
So that, none of you escape.
But they escaped from the bus in midway.
We won't let them go.
So, I'm grooming a hunting dog,
Cuddappah Raja.
He caught them by their throat.
How dare you hit him?
Brother..
How many more should I kill?
If everyone goes to the hospital,
who will work here?
If you commit 1 wrong,
I will cut your legs.
2 wrongs, I will cut your hands.
If you try to escape,
I will cut your head.
- Get up, brother.
- What happened to my brother?
Where will you escape?
Will you go to the police?
Will you go to the collector?
No matter where you go,
I can't be touched.
Because I am Konda Reddy.
I'm not just an MLA,
this village is mine.
You bastards!
Even God can't save you from me.
Hang him.
What happened to my brother?
I don't know whether god
will come to save us,
but my son will come.
When he comes to know
about we suffering here,
your countdown starts.
If this stone has some power,
my words too have a power.
He will come. I swear..
Not only your son,
anyone who dares to come here,
this will be his fate.
Get inside.
- Go.
- Listen to him.
Welcome.
- Boys...
- I'm ready.
Take the pumpkin.
1..2..3.
What is this?
- Saffron.
- Tell the truth.
- This is my blood, right?
- Yes.
What did you put inside the pumpkin?
If I put coins, it may get scattered.
So, I put this alms box.
You rascal! I thought of
giving a good introduction.
But you broke my head.
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.
Why is your car covered?
What is the number?
I asked for the car number.
Aren't you the racer?
My friend is the racer.
He is on the way.
When will he come here?
Clear these things in
15 minute and get ready.
If you fail, I will throw you
and your car out.
Will he come?
You don't know him.
He will make us nervous.
But he will come with
a thunderous noise.
You said it will take a week
to repair this.
Look what happened now.
Our boy is a king.
He repaired it in time.
There is no magic here.
We must work.
If we do it with a flair for it,
Go & finish off other work.
Go
- We thought of making few bucks.
- But you...
I will finish it.
Who is he?
He's last year's winner.
Black is my favourite colour.
Did you see black?
She has got a good shape.
She is dancing too much.
Why is the car covered?
Is the car feeling the chill?
- Don't touch our property?
- What if I touch it?
I may be forced to touch
your property.
Then leave this place.
You can go. I like your sexy looks.
Just 5 more minutes to start the race.
Will we get piles if we eat rice?
This is new.
You & your car must be
ready in 5 minutes.
If you fail, you may have to quit.
These are danger signs.
Take the mobile. Call Vel.
Vel, the race is going to
start in 5 minutes.
I solved a small water problem.
I'm starting now.
If not, I will be chucked out.
- Have Kheer.
- Let me taste it.
I repaired only the water pipe.
Why celebrate it with kheer?
Today is your father's birthday.
Singamuthu's birthday.
Then, we must celebrate it.
He took loans all over
and ran away.
Don't say that.
He gave money to everyone.
I know how generous he is.
He has 3 wives.
fathered a child every year and
even celebrated a silver jublie too.
Please don't say that.
He treated us like queens.
You are looking like queens.
But I am like a servant.
Okay. I am getting late to
the race. I am moving.
Velu, get your father's blessings.
Father, I must win this race.
And I must get rich.
Only then, I can clear all your debts.
- Brother...
- Sister..
Stop it. What's your problem now?
- My husband has gone to Singapore.
- How are you dear?
So, you have come here
to say for a month.
Is he going to Singapore & Malaysia
to sell tooth powder?
Won't you inquire him?
It's a business visit.
Wives always support husbands.
Go inside.
- Pay Rs. 200 to the auto man.
- Okay right.
- All the best.
- Thank you.
All the best.
- A cool breeze caressing me...
- What a shame!
When you can wear it for a game,
can't I wear it? Get lost
- Hey Apps!
- Hi!
C'mon. Zip Zap Zoom.
Look at this car.
This is Mr. Vetrivel's car.
What is a mouse doing here?
I haven't revved the car yet.
But the people are running away.
Not looking at the condition of our car,
but running on seeing the mouse.
Has our Ganesh come here too?
A small mouse on the race track.
Really.
Why isn't she scared?
She has seen some big rats.
Hey look! What a funny vehicle!
You guys covered this iron box?
He is last year's winner.
He is making fun of us
with his Bombay girl friend.
Will you come in a fish cart
in the next race?
He is right.
Look at the condition of this car.
Don't underestimate our car.
This car has won many races.
At the end of the race,
you will know which will win
and which will lose.
Come on to the track.
I will finish you.
Now all the racing cars are driven
to their respective positions.
Move...
Sorry sir.
My friend Velu is in the race.
On track No. 3, we have Sakthi Vel.
On track No. 6, we have Mr. Shavron,
last year's champion. On track No. 2...
Velu is my friend. Take money and
announce his name.
Shut up.
- I once again see Mr. Shavron...
- Hey Velu...
- I once again see Mr. Shavron...
- Hey Velu...Velu.
Yes.
Looks like Mr. Vetrivel's car is in problem.
He looks confident.
Here now, the race gets started.
3..2..1, Go.
The excitement has started.
- Come on...dear.
- Come on...boy.
Will he win?
He will come first and
will take the bumper prize.
Boss, the car bumper is gone.
I told you to buy a new car.
But you never listen to me.
- Will we win?
- Shut up
Ask me. We will win for sure.
Will be prizes be given here?
If required, they will even door deliver it.
- Why all this? Go man....go.
- Get lost.
I've to go this way. Go.
- Is this what door delivery means?
- Shut up.
Why is every part of
your car falling apart?
That's the advantage of that car.
Unnecessary parts will be
discarded automatically.
Just like girls discarding boys.
Beautiful!
It's a fantastic day for Mr. Vetrivel.
- Sir helmet.
- Get lost.
You thought I will lose.
He is just Vel before entering the race.
Once he enters the race,
To win, you need fire
in your heart. Got it?
Hereafter drive the car on the track
Not on somebody's back.
Forget it. If he gets fire from bottom,
it is called piles.
Sorry.
Hey... move away..
brother is coming.
This is Kuruvi's song...
Let's celebrate...
If you win the world,
I'll win over you...
I'll become cyclone
if you strike me...
I was born to my mother...
But was brought up on
the Tamil streets...
We are siblings...
Work hard and it will feed you...
You're a God...
Transform dirty sewages
into fragrant canals...
Sweat it out, it will cool you...
Don't believe rumours...
Trust on seeing only...
Don't be lazy...
Poverty is not a deadline of life...
Hey, move...
Hey, sit man...
If you show the direction,
I'll pave the way...
I'll always be an obedient son
to my mother...
I'm energetic and robust...
My hands are my weapons...
I'm always loyal to you...
You're the walls of my abode...
There are no speed breakers
for my fast growth...
Dare to challenge me,
I'm a braveheart...
Who are you?
Listen to me, who are you?
Painting new?
Why is everything outside?
Brother!
What's this Velu?
They are keeping the things out.
- Won't you listen to me?
- Wait!
Who are you guys?
I told them to put everything outside.
I told them to keep safely.
Who are you to keep them outside?
It was yours yesterday,
but now it's mine.
This is the only property
left for him by his father.
But the documents are with me!
Give me, I paid him Rs.5 millions!
He promised to repay in 6 months
to take the documents.
I was in jail for 6 months.
My boys told that your father
gave a cheque,
but the cheque bounced
due to insufficient funds.
So, I'm taking the property.
How can son be responsible
for dad's loan?
I expected this,
so I took everything in writing.
Give it.
You gave and my father received it.
My father is no more,
but I'm here, did you ask me?
Right, I'll ask you now.
When will you repay my money?
Your money will reach you
in a week.
I trust you.
- Come on boys.
- How can you manage big bucks?
Take this and collect it from
the man in Malaysia.
Come back to me with money.
I don't want the house,
I want money. See you.
Who will keep these things inside?
- Keep the things in it's place.
- Keep it inside.
- Okay.- If I don't get money,
house will be auctioned. See you.
Your husband has spoilt
the means of livelihood too.
Few cheques passed
from Gocha industries.
My dad got the money.
One cheque payment was stopped.
May be stopped because
your father ran away.
If we go to Malaysia with the cheque,
we can get the money.
But how to go there?
We owe a lot to him for the car repairs,
you want me to sell the car to him.
I'm here to solve the problems.
We can settle the dues and
get some extra money too.
No, not a penny less
than 400 thousands.
The bolts are very tight.
Hit on the head with a crowbar.
Everyone wants the winning car,
but we refused.
We don't need to sell it
for our livelihood.
They are quoting a cheap price
for this race car.
I said not a penny less
than 400 thousands,
but he's asking for 300 thousands.
Good price! Sell it.
Is it okay?
Keep it, send the money.
You mean this junk?
How dare you call it a junk?
What do you mean?
Vel, you won the race with this car.
Anythig we own is like
a family member,
I'm keeping it for 50 years
as a sentiment.
- That maid servant?
- I meant Ambassador car.
I must go to Malaysia to get money
from a man who owes my dad.
Or else my house will be auctioned.
Go to Malaysia?
Then, no need to sell the car.
Will you go as a "Kuruvi"?
- "Kuruvi"?
Nothing wrong in it.
Many lndians are living there.
You've to take Indian goodies to them.
And come back with electronic
and perfumes.
You can meet the man
and earn few bucks too.
Will you go?
Yes, we'll fly as "Kuruvis"(couriers).
He said we'll be recieved here.
Are they the "Couriers"?
- Hey "Courier"!
- May be it's him?
Let me give him a clue.
We are the mangoes of Salem!
That guy has recognised us.
- Are you the "Couriers"?
- Yes.
- Sang a song?
- To find you.
Are you a discoverer?
You could've held a bill board.
- Let's go.
- Excuse me.
- What?
- Good body! yes!
Do you eat fodder?
I mean good healthy food!
Things are perfect.
- Give them their things.- Take it.
- Bookibinthong is on the way.
- What do you mean by that?
You'll stay in Pandian lodge there.
- Stay there, your ticket and goods
will reach you by evening.- Okay fine.
- Can I get that here tonight?
- What?
Did I call him to get so angry?
- Can you guide me to this address?
- Read it.
- Right Line Industries.
- Okay.
- No. 17, 1st floor.
- Jalan Samundar Street.
- Okay.
- Kualalampur.
- Okay. No name?
Gocha!
Gocha? Why do you want to meet him?
He owes money to my father.
To get money from Gocha?
Idiots! Stop the car.
The address you asked is far away,
his club is very near.
- Where?
- There!
- Gocha club is on the street end.
- Forget about it.
- Do you want to piss?
- Stop joking.
Why are your legs shivering?
I'm learning to dance.
I've to prepare from here itself.
- Our return tickets?
- Go to him, he'll give you.
- Hurry up!
- Still here?
They were about to get us lynched.
Are you really going to dance classes?
You want me to go with them to Gocha?
They kill for nothing.
These guys want to get old dues.
He's Malaysia's 'Basha' (Don)!
- Enough!
- Drink!
Give him one more drink.
Come on baby, drink.
Why are you getting me drunk?
Because you'll not feel the pain!
Diamond.
Blood Diamond.
They say it's found only in South Africa,
but it's found in Cuddappah
also in Andhra Pradesh,
I and my brother are
mining it illegally.
Rogues! Are you smuggling
diamonds in workers' body?
He's steady even after many drinks,
what if he sings?
Shall we go?
- I'll meet him and come.
- Come fast.
Orange!
Is Gocha running a juice shop?
Drums Shivamani!
For me too?
Only for couples!
Money to use toilet?
I'll use toilet in Madras.
- Please leave.
- No. We go meet Gocha.
No these is club rules.
He's not allowing in
without a female partner.
You're weak in English,
how did you manage?
- I told her the truth.
- You got her for me, thanks buddy.
She's mine not yours!
Couples! See you.
- What?
- Greetings!
I'm coming from Madras.
I'm coming from
Madras Vetrivel lndustries.
So what?
Your company owes
Rs. 5 millions to my dad.
Come after 10 days.
Wake him up!
- Get up brother!- What?
I've 2 days visa only,
I need to go with money.

my house is mortgaged,

I've your bounced cheque and
bank statement. Check it.
- Why did you tear it?
- I don't know who you are! Get lost!
- I can't go without money...
- Go away!
- Go away.
- Leave the place.
Get going!
- Send him out.
- Go....
Why is he dull?
What did Gocha say?
Did he pay?
Did you showm him the cheque?
What happened?
Make a choice!
Where are you going?
What were the 2 choices?
First is honest way.
- Second choice?
- Violence!
- What was my choice?
- Second!
He has started his job!
Still there?
- A man from Chennai is here
with a bounced cheque.- Who?
Singamuthu's son!
My son will come.
The day he knows about us,
you'll face the music then!
Singamuthu's son?
Where is he?
Today he's here for money,
what if he comes back for his father?
Kill him!
I'm not a coward.
I don't take it,
Will you call Gocha or
shall I bring him here?
He is dead meat.
I'm cool but when I get into the act,
it's all fireworks!
Take the wind out of your sails!
Pick up the phone and call him.
Finished him?
Finish me?
I finished your nephew and the club.
- Take the debris!
- Who are you?
- Son of Singamuthu to whom
you owe money.- Stop!
Is it the way you repay the loan?
I came for the principle amount only,
but I'll make you pay intrest also.
Go to the club.
He beat my nephew and
my men in my club.
What were you all doing?
Where is Guna?
Sir! Isn't he like our Guna?
His father predicted he'll come.
His father was a good man,
but this man is a bad guy.
He's dangerous! Kill him!
He's not here!
We searched him all over the city,
he's no where.
Did you call to say this?
Come back if you kill him,
or else get lost!
They will not get him,
I'll kill him myself.
He can't escape from our boys.
We are getting late to the
New year party, come let's go.
- They are talking about us.
- Yes.
A bottle of liquor and an egg
would've been great for me.
You brought me here to enjoy,
but we are getting hunted here.
Don't worry, the New Year is
dawning for us only.
Pull it out!
Will you get me a chocolate?
Why are you dancing?
Pull it out fast!
- Has it come out?
- No, not yet!-
What happened?
You're in a mess!
What happened?
Sister didn't like the ring,
I pulled it out and we both fell down!
Removing the ring will not
cancel your engagement.
God too can't stop this marriage.
Your marriage with Suri on
January 4 is sure to happen.
I hate him!
Can you tell this to your brother?
Impossible!
You've seen him, right?
Wine, women, drugs and
always carries a gun too.
How can I be happy
marrying the rogue?
Look, you were a child
when I was married,
all my difficulties vanished
on seeing your face,
you call me sister-in-law
but you're like my daughter.
You must be happy,
if you like anyone elope with him.
I'll manage your brother.
Impossible!
Somebody must be really dare
to elope with Gocha's sister.
Come.
Hurry up!
Get dressed up for party.
Your brother is waiting,
I can't answer him.
Come out boy!
They are carrying guns,
Iet's be couriers than get killed.
I can't go back without money.
We can go without money
but not without life.
Think again.
I gave a thinking.
Shall we escape?
Only if they recognize us!
Hi guys, how are you doing?
Very beautiful!
- Okay?
- Okay what?
Dress is okay?
What about the face?
You're right.
Look there! Black soil!
Let's paint face with
Malaysian black soil.
- Good idea!
- Stop!
It was my idea, so I'll do it first.
Isn't this goes well with the get up?
You look great!
How come you're always lucky?
That's my charm!
Why does he get good things always?
I don't like this face, oh! drinks!
You carry on and
I'll go after the drinks!
Okay.
Dear friends,
since my sister's engagement
was held in Cuddapah,
I couldn't invite you all.
So, this new year party is my treat
to you all. Enjoy yourself.
All are watching you.
Oh my god! Who is she?
Can't bear this itching.
Why is this gorilla staring at me?
Does he know who I am?
Hello...hello...stop...stop.
I see chicks & liquor all around me.
Where did he go?
Put one drink for me.
Sir your brandy...
Give that to the beast.
- Hey, my glass
- Hold it.
- Is it you?
- Yes, I think its me!
- Where were you?
- A girl is after me.
- But a gorilla is after me.
- Oh god! Here she comes.
I'm not aware of that.
- I want to take your snap.
- Snap?
Camera cell phones must be banned.
Shall I help you to hang your
photo in your house?
One... Two... Three...
You stopped me from
having a peg of liquor.
Speak boss...
I have asked to call me
after reaching Malaysia
But you didn't, you pigs.
You're very much worried
about your couriers.
Tomorrow is my son's reception.
Get back the goods that were sent there.
The goods will reach your place.
To Noor Mahal, Triplicane, right?
Triplicane.
Not just you, I want the goods
also to be there.
We may or may not come.
But your goods will reach you.
Stop, is she the one who is after you?
The groom is over there.
Why are you dancing here?
Yes, it is her.
- She is Tacha's sister.
- What?
I mean Gocha's sister.
Escape...
Come fast.
Hello...
I don't know where to go.
This way.
What place is this?
What bothers us? Let's drink & enjoy.
Someone is coming.
It must be their men.
Aren't you fully in?
It's Gocha.
This diamond has never
come to the market.
It's value is Rs.640 millions.
Is it for sale?
You always asked me
what are we going to do?
I've decided what to do.
What are you going to do?
- I'm going to steal that diamond.
- What for?
To stop our house from
getting auctioned,
- I must steal that diamond.
- But how?
- What's the time now?
- 1 1 :59.
10 seconds before 12:00,
the power will go off.
When the power is restored at 12:00,
the diamond would be mine.
Superb!
What's that noise?
You pig!
Oh, I fell down
Come fast...
Five, Four, Three, Two, One
Happy New Year!
She is searching him everywhere...
She is hunting for him...
She has just seen his eyes only...
Can you find him?
There he is!
- He is a bad boy...
- Too bad!
- He struck like lightining...
- Oh no!
Stole away my heart...
You know?
He is a very bad boy..
He left me crazy...
Find him out...
You know?
Even God will appear before him...
Why war? We have entered
into a new year...
Come and hear this
mindblowing rap song...
You saw his impressive eyes and
heard his mesmerising voice...
He made you blush and
stole your heart...
He is dear to all...
Look there,
he is our young Commander!
He has enchanted me
with a magical spell...
Not yet found his whereabouts...
Haven't yet found him...
Who is he?
Where can I find him?
You know...
Hey girl! Your man is a super bird
near flowing river...
He is dynamic and energetic man...
He's a firebrand action hero...
He is dear to one and all...
She a mad girl...
I got distracted by him...
I was shell shocked on seeing him...
- His place?
- I didn't ask him.
- Can you identify him?
- No!
I was left dazed by him...
He is like a live volcano...
He strikes like a tornado...
Hello...
It's me, Singamuthu's son.
What? Singamuthu's son?
Just listen first.
You have a sheep with handcuffs.
Check whether he has the diamond?
Open the box.
The diamond is here.
Just lick & see whether it is
a diamond or not.
Lick...Iicking.
Bite it.
It's sweet.
A candy will taste sweet, my boy.
Hey...
I don't need your diamonds.
Repay the money you owe my father
and take back your diamond.
You have only 15 minutes
left for the flight.
Don't waste time on your henchmen.
You come alone...with money.
Gocha has come alone.
He is not alone.
He is with his goons.
You wait for me.
I'll have some fun with him.
- Hello!
- Gocha, won't you reform?
I told you to come alone.
But you've come with your pigs.
Are you mad?
I stole your diamond from your place.
What will you do here?
Where are you?
The showdown will now be in Chennai.
He is over there.
Catch him.
You look very tensed.
Looking for someone...?
He might have boarded the flight
before you could come here.
Not just the flight,
even if God of death has
taken him to hell,
I will bring him back from there
and kill him.
What are you doing here?
Did you get him?
- I don't know where he went.
- Find him.
He must be somewhere here.
Search properly.
What's the point in having so many men?
I want him. Go.
Get in.
Welcome sir.
Boss, I am innocent.
You're not wearing any pant I believe.
I am very innocent, boss.
What are you doing here?
Gocha is not wearing his pants.
- It's a girl.
- Girl?
What's wrong with you?
What happened to you?
I see Gocha everywhere.
Will he come here?
- He won't come.
- How?
- I have done something for it.
- What?
- Treatment with blade.
- Blade treatment.
Take the tickets.
My ticket
No, you're not allowed
What's the problem?
You are hurt and bleeding!
You scoundrel!
You poked a sleeping lion.
Can I have your ticket please.
Is he here?
- She is asking for the tickets.
- Tickets?
A ticket (girl) is asking for tickets.
Oh here
She looks like Gocha's sister.
- She is Gocha's sister.
- Go & sit.- No.
A palm fruit is enough for sparrow
no need of a bomb.
You go that way.
I'll go this way.
Oh God!
Sorry madam.
What sorry? Can't you see?
You should have kept your legs inside.
If you keep your legs this way,
everyone will step on them.
See how he is talking!
Hello...is it the first time?
- Is it first time to board a flight?
- No.
Travelling in flights is like
travelling in buses.
I think this is pilot's maiden flight.
While coming, I saw him
looking for brakes.
Last week, a flight took off from Nigeria
met with an accident,
150 people died.
3 days before, a flight took off from
New Zealand & fell into the sea.
- Yesterday in Moscow...
- Stop it.
This is my first time in flight.
I heard you saying something
else a while ago.
I Iied.
I knew it looking at the way
you put on your seat belt.
- The belt is for you not for the bag.
- Oh really!
Thanks
When you're so scared,
why board a flight?
- I'm going to meet an important man.
- lmportant man?
Yes. A man came to our party.
Party is for people to come.
Who is he?
His name is Courier.
His name is Courier.
My name is Terrier.
He stole and left
Stole?
Come on, let's go
Where can we go?
To bathroom
But he stole my heart.
Heart?
I thought he stole gold & diamond.
Then what?
He was like the hero of
the film "Mask of Zorro".
He was jumping, flying...
I was attracted to all his moves.
I went after him.
I slipped & fell down.
He flew in the air and
saved my life.
Rope in one hand and
me in the other.
He touched me in all places.
Lip to lip.
A small gap.
He dumped me in the water & vanished.
I tried to see his face.
But I just missed.
But I have decided that
he'll be my life partner.
Why am I telling you all this?
Forget it.
You know that his name is Courier.
But you didn't see his face.
How are you going to find him?
I didn't see his face.
But with this scarf,
I can recognise his eyes.
Without eyes looking
into each other,
without hands caressing each other,
love never sprouts.
Without shooting us with a gun
or cutting our throats with a knife,
Gocha is not going to leave us.
What's in there?
What everyone has.
What do you mean?
It's the amulet tied by my grandmother.
To stop evils spirits getting near me.
Don't touch it.
If you do so, it is like making
fun of our beliefs.
- Keep moving.
- My grandfather's amulet is much bigger.
Check here.
Check here.
Check my back.
- Are you ok?
- Ok
How was my escape?
You told them to check thoroughly.
Where is the stolen diamond?
I put it in Gocha's sister's bag.
It has come out safely.
Hands up
- A lighter.
- Thank you
No mention
- Is this wallet yours?
- Not mine
Our people lose their wallets somewhere
and look for it elsewhere.
It is safe because I found it.
You're such a good man.
- Who are you?
- Me?
I'm Bujji Babu, from Uzhaikum Karangal.
Call taxi owner cum driver
- Can you drop me at Hotel Raintree.
- Sure.
Can I keep this bag also?
- No, I will keep this bag
She is very alert.
She is gone.
- The one in the phone...is it you?
- Yes.
A man left Rs.3 millions in my taxi.
I handed it over to the police.
S.P. Chowdhry gave me this award.
What now?
- She mentioned some hotel's name.
- Muniyandi vilas.
Gajendra vilas.
Saravana Bhavan.
Street corner shops.
Raintree.
Good morning sir!
How can I help you?
We want a suite room.
- Pay Rs.15000.
- Rs.50000?
No sir. Rs.15000.
- You mean Rs.50000.
- Give me Rs.50000.
Who is she?
- Financier!
- What? Financier?
- My would be wife.
- That's fiance.
Be it anything. Give me the keys first.
Come inside.
- Do you like the room?
- What a beautiful room!
Those who trust me should
never get cheated.
I don't want money.
If you want to go out, tell me.
I will take you there.
- Do you know Triplicane?
- I know.
- Can you take me there?
- Sure.
You freshen up. I will wait for you.
How sweet!
Attack! Great escape!
Look here!
A girl with just a towel.
Must be blue film shoot?
Bus at 5:30...
The film is "Bus at 5:30".
They are remaking it in Tamil.
They are filming bathroom
scene in the reception.
Look there.
It's the girl from Malaysia.
What bloody sorry?
How could the taps go dry
when she in the shower?
Look, she is wrapped up in a towel.
Making fun of her?
Liquor doesn't stop in bars till 3 a.m.
How could there be no water
in the bathroom?
This matter has to be opened now.
It is about water crisis.
Someone stole her baggage.
Stole her bags?
You're worried as if
it was your bag.
What do you mean?
Be it your bag or ours,
everything is same.
They are our bags.
We came by flight together.
We sat next to one another.
We both are Tamilians.
We both are Tamilians.
When a Tamil girl has a problem,
I can't keep quiet.
Call the Manager.
What do you want us to do?
We must get our bags in 10 minutes.
If you don't...
Don't talk without knowing
what had happened.
What more do you want to happen?
You've turned a homely girl
into a cabaret dancer.
- This is not going to work.
- We are talking so seriously.
And he is busy playing video games.
You thought we will create problems, right?
- What really happened, uncle?
- Someone has cheated her.
He booked a room saying
that he is her husband.
Saying she had just delivered a baby,
he took the advance & went away.
What happened then?
Am I narrating any story?
Leave this place now.
I may have to call the police.
He claimed her as his wife
and had a child too.
Looks like he might have
named the child too.
He is busy watching something else.
You're watching her for
the past one hour.
You're waiting for that
rose wicket to fall, right?
I show you something.
Want to see?
What's that?
It's my grandfather's loin cloth.
Take this, Madam.
- Do you know him?
- No.
- Did you note the taxi number?
- No.
But taxi had a photo of his recieving
shield from the Commissioner.
That's our Bujji Babu!
The same guy!
He's a fraud!
It's not the Commissioner,it's
Sivaji Ganesan in film 'Thangapadakkam'.
Mr. Chowdhry?
How this girl got cheated?
- Where will he be?
- I know his house.
Can I have your cell phone please?
- I'll give you mine.
- Thank you.
She's making a local call,
it won't cost much.
- Malaysian line is clear.
- Calling Malaysia?
- Hello! - Sister-in-law!
- Why didn't you call me till now?
I lied that you've gone
to a friend's house.
Taxi driver robbed my baggage.
I lost everything,
passport and money.
I Iost the mask of courier also.
Where is Devi?
- Line's cut.
- Cut?
Line isn't cut.
Rs.300 over!
I make only missed calls
to my father also,
I saved Rs.300 for 3 months,
Where is she?
She's in Chennai to meet the courier.
Son-in-law! Courier!
Let's go to Chennai!
Why is the place crowded?
I think this is not Bujji Babu's house.
This is some fake Godman's house.
What is Godman?
It's a profession of rogues
to cheat people.
Excuse me aunties!
Is it Bujji Babu's house?
- What did you ask now?
- Why are they attacking us?
Are you that fraudster's friend?
Shut up and drop your weapons!
I'm officer Major Sunderrajan,
from Ambattur Real Estate,
- Elephant Gate department!
- Sorry sir.
Yeah...he's my assistant
and that girl is his assistant.
In civil dress!
What did you show them?
Voter ID card!
People fear any laminated lD card.
- Okay.
- Where is Bujji Babu?
He robbed all of us,
my gold chain, her moped,
we all are his victims.
Victims are pouring out.
He escaped before we came here.
My God! House under lock.
Somebody there is crying profusely.
Why are you crying?
- They lost only things.
- You?
He robbed my virginity!
What were you doing when he was on job?
I was watching TV soap opera.
Got raped while watching TV serial?
It's molest!
It's a hopeless case.
We missed him.
He's smarter than us,
so escaped.
- He's here! I'm sure!
- What makes you so sure?
Look at the guy going there!
Come.
How can I jump?
Can I get a lift for you? Jump!
- I can't.
- Then?
Tell him to bend.
- Who?
- You!
I'm from a respectable family,
how can I bend?
She's Gocha's sister, remember that!
She appears thin but
heavy like a boxer!
Tell me what's the matter?
Military vehicle? Is it a joke?
Photos with film stars Rajinikanth,
Kamalhasan and Sivaji.
This fraud is playing havoc
with many lives.
Look after my mother well,
I love my mother...
I'll donate my kidney also.
One? We are here for
your both kidneys.
Who is she?
Fraud! Give me my bag,
I want my bag.
There's only one dirty bag here,
nobody is willing to buy it,
you can take it.
Where is my small bag?
You change the dress,
we'll inquire him.
You take your own time.
Where is the small bag?
On the cot!
Small bag!
- Thank you.
- No mention.- Bye!
Couldn't you've told
that after 5 minutes?
Leave him, what if she escapes?
We can beat him later.
Why later? Open the shutter
and law will do it's duty.
Take him!
- Did she escape with the bag?
- Did she give us a slip?
Never cheat people who helped you,
you'll pay for the sin.
Give me a hand.
- Nice meeting you...
- Hello...
Help me!
- I can't walk.
- I'm sure it's a fracture.
Fracture?
Sprain, that's how we call here.
I must attend marriage
at Bhai's place.
Will you limp to his place?
You can walk only if
sprain is relieved.
Sprain? Will you do it?
I do for arrogant men only,
not for women.
Who will do it then?
Mother!
- Who?
- Your mother!
Our mother, a great masseur!
If you take her there,
they make her lie and
do oil massage,
bag will be on table and
it will go missing.
What?
Sprain, pain and everything else.
- My mother is a great masseur.
- Pick her up!
Look at your son!
He has come with a pregnant lady!
Remove it, you're out to
spoil my character.
I told you not befriend that rogue.
Oh my God!
Missed by a whisker!
Missed?
Who is she?
She's Devi from Malaysia,
she fell & sprained her leg.
Why did you bring her here?
Take her to a doctor.
Doctor? He said you relieve
sprains with massage.
Who said that?
Mother!
Why are you asking me to do it?
- Her brother owes us money.
- What should I do now?
Apply castor oil and
think of my father,
and show anger on her,
the sprain will vanish.
What to do now?
Don't you know?
Make her sleep on belly.
Do I've to?
Lord Muruga!
Not you mom, make her do it.
It's been years, she lost the touch.
Got sprained here?
How am I going to do it?
- What to do now?
- Castor oil!
Why are making fun of me son?
Apply the oil and start singing a song.
Sexy hip beauty...
Fair complexioned beauty...
She's singing in tune.
Singing? She's crying in pain,
massage properly.
Paining?
Hold something for relief!
I'm holding!
How is it?
Super!
Why are you spoiling yourself
joining with that fraudster?
I'm fine!
Grandma's treatment worked!
I'm fine now!
It's gone! So I'm going!
I'm leaving.
You forgot the bag.
Gave it in an emotional outburst.
Why are you going away?
We haven't yet finished it.
Sprain is gone, I'm fine.
Our job isn't over yet.
What?
Tell her!
You can take rest and go.
No, I must meet courier in
the marriage at Bhai's place.
This area is very bad,
you may get molested, sleep here.
Be ware! Be alert!
She's using the bag as pillow.
Courier! You can't escape from me.
I found you!
I love you!
I love you so much! Really!
Bloody!
- Where is she?
- Who?
- Last night's guest.
- She?
Last night...
Playing fun with me singing songs?
We haven't done anything to your girl,
she's taking bath.
Say that first.
Go carefully, don't pounce on her.
Your kiss is classical Tamil...
Good morning sister-in-law!
Can I get a coffee?
No need to ask, this is your home,
you can have anything you like,
you have all the rights.
- I think entire family is crazy.
- Take your coffee.
In a tumbler?
I want cup and saucer.
Have it, sister-in-law,
that's my brother's tea tumbler.
Your brother's? Nasty tumbler!
Where am I to keep it?
If the tumbler is nasty,
what about kissing my son?
- Kiss?
- Yes.
- Did you enter my bedroom last night?
- I did.
Shouldn't I come to my bedroom?
You kissed me
without my knowledge.
Your entire family saw it.
Is that worrying you?
- I didn't do it, you kissed me.
- Me?
You were mumuring about courier
and kissed me passionately.
- How could I?
- Like this...
Why didn't you stop me?
You do everything and
then accuse us.
I'll not stay here.
Go, grandma will be in reception,
settle the bill and leave.
You cheat! You rascal!
Why are you banging the car?
Get lost blackard!
I heard all this!
Trying to get smart with me.
Diamonds are missing!
Diamonds are missing?
- May be it's in her bag?
- May be!
- Where?
- Go to Triplicane!
- Is it him?
- No.
- Is it him?
- No.
- Is it him?
- No.
That's police!
Hello madam.
- Sorry.
- That's better!
New courier recruits.
We recruited two new faces.
They will give up self respect
but not the biryani here.
Take your mask.
The bag is here!
She's smiling at me!
Frowning at you!
- Frowning?
- Be steady.
- Steady?
- Give me support!
Why did you come here?
For a free meal?
Didn't I tell you?
We'll find the couriers for her.
Don't try to act smart,
I checked everyone here.
Just two new recruits are left,
She's going to find them!
Very happy!
Come...come...
Why did you catch my back?
You caught my bag,
so I caught your back.
How is it?
Good, but few pounds lesser
will be more beautiful.
You know me?
I'm PC of this area.
Police? I'm very sorry madam.
- What's in this bag?
- There's something...
He's lying, that's my bag!
Robbers are after me for 2 days.
Give the bag.
I can return after the inquiry only.
Hey come here!
