It's a story that might bore you,
but you don't have to listen,
because I always knew
it was going to be like that.
( techno music playing )
Woman: And it was, I think,
in that last year, or weekend--
really a Friday in December
at Camden--
and this was years ago,
when I was a different person
and I was so drunk that
I ended up losing my virginity.
I lost it to some guy who I thought
was a Ceramics major,
but was actually
either a NYU film student
who was just up to Camden
for the "End of the World,"
or a townie.
I actually had my eye
on someone else that night-- Victor.
I'm telling you,
with European girls,
it's just a numbers game.
If you stand in any major European
city on any fucking corner,
and consecutively ask every girl
that walks by if she'll fuck you,
one out of 20 will say "yes."
Woman: A junior, a Drama major,
just back from Europe...
only a little gay,
with flecked blond hair,
a great body
and these amazing gray eyes.
Bam-- 20th one, you're fucking.
Right there.
It's a confirmed statistic,
my man.
Woman: But Victor was fucking
my roommate, Lara.
She gave him mono
before he dumped her.
I'm told that later,
after I left Camden,
she got really drunk and went
wandering through Windham House,
and did the whole
football team.
( music plays )
Man: White girl...
She's now married to a senator
and has four kids.
How time distorts things.
So you know the movie
I'm talking about?
It was wrongfully labeled
"A Tarantino Film,"
even though he was just credited
as executive producer.
So this guy
from NYU, or whatever--
who wasn't even
a good Victor facsimile--
and I were talking
on this ratty old couch.
I'm sure you've seen this movie,
this Russian classic,
- "The Man with the Camera"?
- Yep, yep.
I kept agreeing with his likes
and dislikes, all the time thinking
that while he might not be Victor,
he was cute enough.
It's real.
It's like real... shit.
I was sure that I was mispronouncing
all these filmmakers' names,
remembering
all the wrong actors,
naming the wrong cinematographers,
but I wanted him.
...I see the same kind
of "silent movie actress" quality.
Seriously, has anyone ever told you
you look like Clara Bow?
Because you do, I'm serious.
I'm telling you.
I know these things, and...
and...
Woman: I could see that his gaze was
drifting towards Kristin Notneff.
And she was looking back at him
with confidence, because she knew
that underneath her clothes
she was wearing a black bra
with matching black lace panties,
which I wasn't.
Um, I'm sorry,
what was I talking about?
Woman:
But I had the next best thing.
I've got a joint
in my room.
Except it wasn't my room.
It was Lorna Slavin's room,
who was off-campus
at her boyfriend's house,
probably swallowing
his DNA.
And I didn't have
a joint either,
and if I did,
I didn't know where it was,
because it would have been
Lorna Slavin's joint.
He wouldn't have cared
if I had one or not.
I must have passed out
around then.
When I came to,
he was already fucking me,
but he didn't know that I was
a virgin and that it hurt.
Not that badly-- only
a little bit of sharp pain,
but not as bad as I had been
taught to expect--
but not exactly
pleasant, either.
That's when I heard
another voice in the room.
Now, I want you to do her
like Ron Jeremy would.
Woman: I remember
the weight on the bed shifting,
and realizing
that this person behind me
wasn't the NYU film student guy,
but somebody else.
Oh, my God,
it was some townie.
I had actually
lost my virginity to a townie.
( boy grunting )
This wouldn't
have happened with Victor.
He would have taken me gently
in his big, strong Drama major arms,
and undressed me
quietly and expertly,
taken my bra off
with grace and ease.
And it probably wouldn't
have hurt.
I should have given myself to Victor
last term when I had the chance.
( door bangs )
Dude, we had to put
the keg somewhere.
Don't put it there,
it's blocking my shot.
Now get the fuck out of here
before you ruin my movie.
( gasping )
Woman: I always knew
it would be like this.
I just get the feeling
my life lacks forward momentum.
Like everything is
moving by so quickly
that time just seems
to stop.
( pool break shot )
Man's voice: Sometimes I can't
believe the shit
that spills out
of my mouth.
So while I talk about
God knows what,
I let my eyes
drift across the room,
as my mouth allows thoughts
to drop out of my brain
and roll off my tongue
like gumballs,
I imagine all the things
in life that never were,
and all the things
that could have been.
He'll do.
I like this song.
Man's voice:
Gay song, definitely.
Do you have any E?
That shit makes
your spinal fluid run backwards.
- I may have some up in my room.
- You're game, right?
No one's
twisting your arm.
I don't even know why
I'm trying to convince you.
Let's do it.
I think it's kicking in.
I feel it now, too.
Man's voice: The truth is,
I feel nothing.
What the fuck!
- Sorry, I thought you were gay.
- Fuck you, I'm no fag!
You sure about that?
I definitely detect a certain
"faggy-ness" to you.
Get the fuck outta here,
you fucking homo!
I'm not gay.
You're lucky
I don't kill you.
Luck has nothing
to do with it.
Everything
is preordained.
Manifest destiny.
You can stop time from happening
no more than you can will
the oceans
to overwhelm the world,
or to cause the moon
to drop from her outer sphere.
Three months later,
the handsome dunce
had an affair
with a friend of mine.
Within a year,
he was a full-blown queen
and telling people
I couldn't get it up.
Luck has nothing
to do with anything.
Man's voice: A great numb feeling
washes over me
as I let go of the past
and look forward to the future.
I pretend
to be a vampire.
I don't really need to pretend,
because that's who I am,
an emotional vampire.
I've just come
to expect it--
that vampires are real,
that I was born this way,
that I feed off of other
people's real emotions.
I search
for this night's prey.
Who will it be?
You look familiar--
have we met?
I think I fucked her somewhere
toward the beginning of term,
the "Wet Wednesday" party.
No.
- What's your name?
- Peter.
Really?
Aren't you a senior?
No, a freshman.
Really?
I thought you were older.
No, I'm a freshman.
Peter.
Peter the freshman.
She has dick-sucking lips,
so I consider the options.
I leave right now,
go back to my room,
play the guitar...
masturbate to broadband-speed
Internet porn...
I'm going
to come on those tits.
...go to sleep.
Or...
I could play "Quarters"
with Dickie and Quinlivan
and that dumb guy from LA.
Or I could take her
to the Carousel for some coffee
and ditch her there
with the bill.
Or I could take her back
to my room,
hope the Frog is gone,
get stoned and fuck her.
So, what do you think?
What do I think?
I think, why not?
Rock and roll.
She slowly followed me
back to my dorm room
Iike she knew
this would happen,
too eager,
too stunned to speak.
I was so excited,
I couldn't stop shaking
and I dropped the key
when I tried to unlock the door.
She sat on the bed and I played
her a song I had written myself,
then segued into one
by Counting Crows.
I played it quietly and sang
the lyrics slowly and softly.
She was so moved that
she actually started to cry.
* I'm not ready
for this sort of thing... *
Maybe it was the Ecstasy
I'm pretty sure she was on.
Maybe it was that she thought
she really loved me.
But when he kissed her on the
lips, he instantly went hard.
She was crying,
her face was slick,
but she let let him
pull her clothes off.
She smelled like sweet fruit.
She was small, too.
Her pubic hair
was light and sparse.
Yet, when he fingered her,
he didn't feel anything--
she wasn't getting wet,
even though she was
making soft little moans.
He was semi-stiff
and losing his erection.
Something was wrong,
something was missing,
he didn't know what.
Confused,
he started to fuck her.
Before he came, it hit him--
he can't remember the last time
he had sex sober.
Girl: Peter! Oh, Peter!
( classical music plays )
Fuck!
* This is stranger
than I thought *

You sneaky bitch.
Sean's voice:
"Got you.
You're mine now
for the rest of the day,
week, month, year, life.
Have you guessed who I am?
Sometimes I think you have.
Sometimes,
when you're scanning a crowd,
I feel those sultry dark eyes
of yours stop on me.
Are you too afraid to come up to me
and let me know how you feel?
I want to moan
and writhe with you,
and I want to go up to you
and kiss your mouth
and pull you to me and say,
'Love you, love you,'
while stripping.
I want you so bad it stings.
I want to kill the ugly girls
you're always with.
Do you really like those boring,
naive, coy, calculating girls,
or is it just for sex?
The seeds of love
have taken hold,
and if we won't burn together,
I'll burn alone."
* This is stranger
than I ever thought. *
What?
How'd she do that?
Blood clot.
What's going on?
You're gonna have
to sell that bike of yours,
- that's what's going on.
- Why?
Where's my money,
college boy?
Do you take
American Express?
That's not funny.
You like that?
They taught it
to me in the Army.
One of 1 7 hand-to-hand
combat methods
of rendering
your enemy defenseless.
Now, all I got to do
is apply positive pressure
to rip your carpals free
from your metacarpals,
and you will be unable
to operate your weapon!
I'm not your enemy, Rupert,
and I don't have a weapon.
That's why you get
a little time, homes.
You want some coke?
Sure.
Then buy some
of your own, bitch.
Get the fuck out of my crib
and get me my money.
There's an Orgy Night
at Booth House.
I'm scoring for a bunch
of freshman.
They're rich, they want cocaine,
they'll pay premium to get it.
What do you think?
I think you're a rich
motherfucking motherfucker,
who owes me a shitload
of motherfucking cash.
That's what I think, you rich
motherfucking motherfucker.
You want some blow,
motherfucker?
You bring me my motherfucking
cash, motherfucker! Fuck you!
Jesus fucking Christ, Rupert,
don't get so tense.
I'll show you tense,
motherfucker.
You're into me
for a fuckload of money,
and I think you and your
motherfucking rich-kid friends
are gonna take off to all your
rich-ass motherfucking lives,
Ieaving me holding
my motherfucking dick!
So fuck you!
Fucking, Rupert, fucking A'.
I'm not like those rich assholes.
I'm on financial aid.
I have to work for a living.
I'm from a fucking farm
in Nebraska.
My family had to sell
the fucking cow to get me here.
- I'm working in food service.
- Bullshit!
My father's
in the hospital, okay?
My family's strapped for cash.
I might have to drop out.
- Really?
- The Lord is my witness. Yes.
You really don't have
any fucking cash?
No, I had to work all summer
just to pay for this term.
I thought you went home
to New York for the summer.
That's what I told people
so they wouldn't laugh at me.
I actually had to wash pigs
all summer, Rupert.
Jesus Christ, man, I can get
these kids to overpay,
they're so desperate
for drugs.
I'm your key to moving
this shit on campus.
You need me,
and you know it.
And I need the cash.
We need each other.
You get this straight,
fuckhead.
I need you like I need
a motherfucking asshole
on my elbow!
Right here! An asshole!
That's how much
I need you.
What do you think, Guest?
I think you should
sniff less cocaine.
And stop leaving the gun there
laying on the table, man.
Leave the boy alone before
he piss in panty.
( laughs )
You know I'm just fucking with you,
baby, right?
Right.
( sniffs )
What kind of markup
do you think you can get
off these
rich-ass freshmen?
Well, that depends on
how stepped-on it is.
Stepped-on? Guest,
is our shit stepped-on?
No, man, it's fresher
than the morning snow.
What the bumbaclot
wrong with him?
Maybe 20%
over market value.
50%, you say!
Hot damn, college boy!
That's some good
motherfucking math!
I do believe
we have ourselves a deal.
Do we have
ourselves a deal?
Sean: Sure.
Good, it's time for you
to get to work.
Sometimes, a minute...
will last like an hour,
you know?
Where other times...
an hour just...
just zips by
in like a minute.
It's all subjective.
Every person perceives it...
perceives it different.
It's like, that's why you can't
trust clocks, you know?
Marc, you owe me 500 bucks.
I want it by Sunday.
Okay?
You notice I don't have
any clocks in my room,
because they interfere
with your ability to...
...to adjust the time to...
to suit your needs,
you know?
Marc.
Do not be a slave to time,
my friend,
because, it--
there's no point.
( Marc gasps )
( groans )
( grunting )
I-- I can feel my dick.
I can feel my dick.
Whoo!
Oh my God!
- Hey! Fucking, hey!
- ( banging bed )
What about the cash?
Marc, what about
the fucking cash?
What class, man?
Who teaches that?
Fucking--
Just go away, you know.
Just stop bugging me.
Just stop asking me.
Stop kicking my fucking bed.
Stop, you know, oooh...
I'll get you your fucking--
just don't fuck my karma, dude!
Don't fuck it up!

( cheering )

Hi, Mitch. What's up?
Not very much.
What's up with you?
Not much.
Can we talk?
What do you want
to talk about?
Just what's going on.
Hey, I warned you.
Remember that.
I know, I know.
Wait, what did you
warn me about?
I warned you!
* Shake, shake, shake... *
Wait, Mitch.
Mitch, don't be
such a pussy.
I am warning you again.
I don't know
what your fucking problem is.
Just stay the fuck aw--
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.
Is there some sort of problem,
Paul and Mitchell?
No-- you two
know each other?
Yeah. Hi.
Hi.
Mitch, I'm kinda through
partying tonight.
Do you want to walk me
back to my room?
My roommate's
at her boyfriend's tonight.
Mitch: Yeah.
What about you, Paul?
What are you doing?
- Come on, let's go.
- It might be fun.
- No.
- Come on.
- Let's go.
- You know you want to.
- Later, guy.
- Bye, Paul. Maybe next time.
Mr. Bateman.
Excuse you.
Sean Bateman, right?
Right. It's Paul?
Right.
The girl with Mitchell?
Paul: You mean, Candice?
Her name is Candice.
Yeah, that's right.
I had a class with her,
but I failed it.
Really?
My type of guy.
Fucking keg's dead.
Typical. I wish
I had a case of beer.
- Quesadilla?
- What?
A quesadilla?
Mexican food? El Sombrero?
El Sombrero closed
a long time ago.
How about tomorrow night?
I'll buy.
I don't know.
You'll buy?
Totally buy.
Rock and roll.
Tomorrow, then.

I've never seen you

That's what's so typical.
It's the first time I ever
bothered to show up for it.
Yeah, you've got

Saturdays suck ass.
I don't have to put up

I'm dropping

- Really?
Mm-hmm. I think I'm
gonna change my major.

- What's yours?
- I don't even know.

Your name's
Sean Bateman, right?
Right.
Your name is Lauren.
Yeah. I bought pot
from you last year.
It was good.
A little seedy though.
You used to go out with

Oh my God.
Harry tried to kill himself.
Paul's voice:
That is so typical.
I just knew something like this
was going to happen.
I just had a feeling that
there would be some obstacle,
major or minor,
that was going to prevent
my evening with Sean
from happening.
You've got to come
to Fel's house-- he's there.
Shit, Jesus, Paul.
We've got to do something.
That's way too gay.
Um... call security?
Trust me, they'll be there
within an hour.
Security. Security?
What do you need,
a formal fucking invitation?
I have an appointment
at 7:00, Raymond!
You are killing Harry!
Pull it together!
Mach schnell!
What did he do, try to OD
on Sudafed and wine coolers?
Oh, my God.
I brought Paul.
- What did he take?
- I don't know.
Oh, Harry, sweetie,
are you okay?
He's going to get
death of cold.
I think we should take him
to Dunham Hospital.
That's all the way in fucking
Keene! Are you crazy?
- Where else is there, asshole?
- I have to meet someone at 7:00.
Fuck your meeting!
Get the car, Raymond!
Grab his feet! Jesus!
Jesus, this is so typical.
He found out
he was adopted today.
Could we stop at a Circle K
and get some cigarettes?
I remind you we have
somebody OD'ing back here.
He's not OD'ing.
He's a freshman.
Freshman don't OD.
Fuck you, Paul!
Oh shit, he's throwing up!
- Open the fucking window!
- He's not throwing up.
Then what do you call
that "ccchhh" sound, huh?
Dry heaves.
He's forgetting to breathe
and he has a lot of air
in his stomach.
Maybe you should be
inducing vomiting.
Should I just
pull the car over?!
- Can I change the CD?
- Shut up, Paul!
You're going to be okay.
* Blue-eyed dressed
for every situation *
* Moving through
the doorway of the nation-- *
( music stops )
- Come on, grab his arm.
- Oh, God.
Okay, you're
gonna make it.
Both: Help!
- Help!
- We need some help over here.
- Please! This guy's OD'ing!
- Oh my God.
Will you get him
into the Emergency Room?
- Thank God.
- I'm on my break.
I there anyone else
around here, please?!
- Hello?
- Please take care of Harry.
Please, you've got
to take care of him!
- Move, move!
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
Sir, can I speak
to your manager, please?
Will you get him up.
His name's Harry, please!
- What's his name?
- Harry.
- Harry.
- Harry, Harry.
I'm not getting any pulse.
Is this a joke?
I can see him moving.
He's not dead.
- I can see him breathing.
- He's dead, Paul, shut up!
And how did this happen,
exactly?
- Oh God, I don't know!
- Oh God, oh God!
Will you shut up?
He's not dead.
He hasn't got a pulse.
There's no heartbeat.
His pupils are fixed
and dilated.
Harry, please come back.
Sorry, there's nothing more
I can do here.
You have
to do something.
I've seen this on ER.
Please fix him!
Harry's gone bye-bye.
Harry's gone to the big bye-bye.
He's got his name in the papers
on the back side.
It's "'toe-tag time'
in Teenville" tonight. Again.
- What?
- Teenville?
You should've
just said no, Harry.
- I'm not dead, am I?
- Ahh!
Yes, you are!
Shut up!
Actually, you don't have
a pulse. I think you're dead.
If you let me run a few tests,
I could probably prove it.
- You've got a malpractice suit!
- Harry is dead.
You don't know
what you're talking about!
Harry: Seriously,
am I dead?
A few tests on Harry, I'm sure
I could prove he's dead.
No! Pain and suffering!
I must insist you bring back
your friend's corpse
for me to do
some tests.
( groans )
Is your ultimate deterrent
to a Friday night party working?
Sort of.
The best
would be Victor though.
Okay, enough fantasizing.
Victor is 3000 miles away.
Use the book.
Okay, how do I look?
You look
kinda skinny, actually.
Skinny? Really?
Bulimic skinny
or anorexic skinny?
What's the difference?
Bulimic skinny passes
for healthy,
except your teeth rot, but
my teeth aren't rotting, so...
So you look bulimic skinny?
Lauren, I'm telling you,
it's amazing the weight you lose
when you get off the pill.
Yeah, until the 50 pounds you gain
when you get knocked up.
Okay, well, do the math.
If a condom is 98% safe,
and he wears two,
then you're 196% safe.
That is a much better percentage
than the pill can offer.
I don't think
it works that way, Lara.
Abstinence is 1 00% safe, which
is less of a percentage than--
Whatever, I don't care.
I don't major in math.
- So are you coming or not?
- I don't know.
Lauren, listen to your friend
and roommate.
If you spend the rest
of your life
waiting for Victor, you're
never gonna lose your virginity.
You can't just wait for destiny
to play itself out.
You have
to make it happen.
( retching )
Is she coming tonight?
- I doubt it.
- Why?
- She's been looking at the book.
- What book?
It's this big medical book
she's got of venereal diseases.
Before a party, she looks
through it to discourage herself
from hooking up
with people like you.
It's got some
pretty nasty imagery.
And it helps her keep her
focused on her homework.
- So, she's not coming, then?
- Nope.
So, you want to get me
another beer?
Hey, Sean.
Sorry I'm late.
What?
There was this whole thing--
I had to take this freshman
to the hospital and there was
this sick kid and, anyhow, I'm--
What the fuck
are you talking about?
- I'm here.
- Never mind.
- I'll make it up to you.
- You don't have to.
I know I don't have to,
but I want to.
- I insist.
- Whatever.
Really.
I have some pot
in my room
if you want to smoke
and get stoned.
- You have pot?
- In my room, yeah.
- Want a beer?
- Let's go.
Hey, Lauren, this is...
- Jim.
- Jim, from Dartmouth.
- Hi.
- Brewski for you-ski?
- Sure.
- Hey, you want it you got it.
He thinks this is the
"Dress to Get Screwed" party.
If you want him,
I'll give him to ya.
No, that's okay.
You sure? 'Cause I don't see
Victor around.
What about Sean Bateman?
Have you seen him around?
Yeah, actually, Sean Bateman
just ran off with Paul.
- Paul Denton?
- Uh-huh.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
You don't think... no.
- I don't know.
- No.
He must just be
selling him something.
- Must be.
- Must be.
Yeah.
Okay, so what is this?
Are you out on the prowl again?
Yeah, that book's
just not-- it's not doing it.
- No?
- Huh-uh.
Good. Okay, well, just
don't wait up for me, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
Miss Lauren Hynde.
Why weren't you
at my tutorial last Saturday?
Would you like a drink?
( classical music plays )
( chuckles )
Come here.
- Mmm?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
- ( laughs )
- Do you want a turn-on?
- No thanks.
Well...
don't mind if I do.
Are we going to do it
here on the couch?
Do what?
You know, do it.
( laughs )
What?
Fuck?
Oh, are you mad?
I would lose my tenure.
And I'm a married man.
But aren't you
hitting on me?
Well, for a hummer, sure.
I've heard
you're talented, Miss Hynde.
And it certainly
can't hurt your GPA.
So, shall we?
So where did you
spend last summer?
- Berlin.
- Paul: Sprechen sie Deutsch?
What?
- Do you speak German?
- No.
- What the f--?
- You don't?
No. Why?
Well, I don't know.
I just assumed, since
you spent the summer in Berlin--
I thought maybe you--
No. Berlin, New Hampshire.
Sean's voice:
I need to get some more pot.
I'm running out.
And I need to get laid.
Where the fuck
was Lauren tonight?
Lara's kind of hot. I could
bang her and feel good about it.
I'd rather have Lauren.
I wonder why.
It would just ruin
my illusion of her innocence,
her purity.
Whoa!
Is that really what I want?
I need to fuck someone.
Then I need to get more pot.
Paul's voice: I watched him
with growing intensity
as he refilled the pipe in the dark
and smoky din of the room.
He delicately fingered
what looked like dried moss to me,
and it struck me then
that I liked Sean
because he looked slutty,
a boy who'd been around.
A boy who couldn't remember
if he was Catholic or not.
* Whooo... *
* I don't know what color
your eyes are, baby *
* But your hair
is long and brown *
* Your legs are strong
and so, so long *
* And you don't come
from this town *
* My head is
full of magic, baby *
* And I have to share
this with you *
* I feel I'm
on top again, baby *
* That's got everything
to do with you *
* I'm alive *
* So alive. *
Woman on TV:
Suck it harder!
Look at that chick's cans.
- Implants.
- I like the feel of fake tits.
( phone rings )
- I need to get cable in my room.
- Hello?
Hi, Mom.
- ( turns sound off )
- What's going on?
Sean:
You are one dirty bitch!
Paul: Tomorrow?
The Jareds are coming?
Oh.
Does it have to be this weekend?
I have a lot of schoolwork.
- How about next weekend?
- Faggoty sitcom,
- faggoty sitcom...
- Paul: Richard?
Okay.
Yeah, you too.
I have to go into the city
tomorrow night.
Rock and roll.
- You want to go?
- Nope.
"Dressed to Get Screwed Party"
is tomorrow night.
I know, and I don't want
to leave you here alone.
Deal with it.
I'm borrowing these.
Wait.
Would you give me a ride
to the bus station tomorrow?
Whatever. Look,
I have to meet my advisor.
( woman on TV moans )
Paul's voice:
I shouldn't be leaving.
He'll sleep with someone else. It's
the "Dressed to Get Screwed Party."
What the fuck am I doing?
I love you, Sean Bateman.
Sean's voice: I wonder
if Lauren goes wild during sex.
I wonder if she comes easily.
Or at all. I won't go to bed
with a girl who doesn't.
If I can't make a girl come,
why bother?
It would be like asking
questions in a letter.
Mmmm...
I'm hungry.
Sean's voice: "Tonight's the night.
Tonight's the night.
Tonight's the night.
Tonight's the night.
Tonight's the night."
( inhales deeply )
So, tonight's the night?
- I'm going all the way.
- Who's the lucky boy?
- I'm not telling.
- You will if you want the room.
Okay, okay...
- Sean Bateman.
- He's a drug dealer.
- He made me "zzshing"!
- "Zzshing"?
"Zzshing" like you just know
that you'll be with that person
and something amazing
will happen,
Iike he just fucking
fucks you right up the--
"Zzshing."
- No, I've never heard that.
- You will someday.
You know, you might be
afflicted with synesthesia.
What?
It's a clinical disorder
which causes you
to hear what you see
and see what you hear--
an uncontrolled combination
of your senses.
You should really get that
checked out.
- Prozac might help.
- What?
Aaah!
Oooh...
Rusty pipes.
( country music plays )
* And the thought of rubbing feet
is getting so exciting *
* Skyrocket in flight *
* Afternoon delight. *
( phone rings )
Hello?
Can I talk to Sean Bateman?
I think he lives upstairs.
( sighs )
Yeah?
Sean.
Who is this,
Patrick?
Who the hell is Patrick?
No, it's is Paul.
Paul...?
Yeah, remember me?
Sean: No.
This better be good.
I was just wondering what was
going on. Who's Patrick?
It's none of your business,
what do you want?
Paul:
Were you asleep?
- No, of course not.
- What are you doing?
That's none of your
fucking business.
I'm getting ready
to go to this party.
With who?
With Patrick?
No.
( chuckles )
With the person who's leaving
notes in my box.
- Are you?
- Deal with it.
- Are you just fucking with me?
- Rock and roll.
- ( dial tone hums )
- Motherfucker!
Who?
Oh, Jesus Christ, Richard,
is that you?
It's Dick.
And yes, it's me.
( gargling )
What the hell
are you doing?
Getting fucked up.
Maybe getting fucked.
- ( Richard moans )
- Oh, Richard.
All right, Richard--
Oh, yeah, you're just
turning me on, Richard.
Richard:
Ride 'em cowboy!
Paul--!
You remember Mrs. Jared?
Of course.
Hello, Mrs. Jared.
I leave you alone for five
minutes and you're drinking.
Drunk.
I'm drunk.
Mrs. Jared: Then take a shower
and sober up.
Oh, my tortures never end.
How are you, Paul?
Fine.
Would you talk to him?
He'll listen to you.
Come on, Myra.
I'll see you both downstairs
in 1 5 minutes, hmm?
- ( Richard chuckles )
- ( door closes )
You want to take
a shower with me...
for old times' sake?
- Want one?
- What are they?
- Does it matter?
- No.
* Oh well, I guess
it would be nice *
* If I could touch
your body *
* I know not everybody *
* Has got a body
like you *
* But I've gotta
think twice *
* Before I give
my heart away *
* And I know
all the games you play *
* Because I play them too... *
Fine with me.
( yawning )
So when she showed up...
* Oh baby, I reconsider *
* My foolish notion *
* Well, I need someone
to hold me *
* But I wait
for something more *
* Yes, I gotta have faith *
* I gotta have faith *
* 'Cause I gotta have
faith, faith, faith, *
* I gotta have
faith, faith, faith... *
Oh, yeah.
* Got to,
got to have faith *
* Before this river,
becomes an ocean *
* Before you throw my heart
back on the floor *
* Oh baby, I reconsider *
* My foolish notion *
* Well, I need someone
to hold me *
* But I'll wait
for something more *
* 'Cause I gotta
have faith *
* Ooh,
I gotta have faith *
* 'Cause I gotta have
faith, faith, faith, *
* I gotta have
faith, faith faith. *
Mrs. Denton: Then I realized
my Cadillac had been stolen.
Mrs. Jared:
Oh, my God.
Mrs. Denton: Stolen. The police
couldn't have cared less.
They said my insurance
would take care of it.
Frankly, I was getting sick
of the color, you know?
Mrs. Jared: I'm going to ask
one more time, Richard,
kindly remove
your sunglasses.
( low growling )
Very well, then...
why don't you
tell us about school?
Tell us about school.
- Ciggy.
- Oh, Ri-- don't smoke.
You're not allowed
to smoke here, Richard...
-...I don't think--
- My name is not Richard.
- Then what is it?
- Dick.
- What?
- Dick.
You heard me.
Dick.
No.
Your name is Richard.
Sorry, it's Dick.
Well, then-- Dick,
how is school?
It sucks cock.
( coughing )
Yeah, it does.
And what classes
are you taking-- Dick?
"Gang Bang 1 01,"
"Freebase Tutorial"...
( whispers )
and "Oral Sex Workshop."
( nervous laughter )
Well, then, how are you
liking that, Dick?
( rude moaning )
( chuckles )
Yeah.
"How do you like that?"
What has happened to you?
What do you mean,
what has happened to me?
What do you think?
I can see what that school
has done to you.
Maybe perhaps Paul and I
should go upstairs--
- Mrs. Jared: No.
- Mrs. Denton: No?
No. If anyone is going
to leave this table,
- it's going to be Richard.
- It's Dick!
Leave the table now,
Richard.
( mock whining )
Why? Why?
I'm asking you
to leave the table, now.
( snidely )
No, no, no...
I will not leave the table.
No!
Leave the table!
( howls )
Well, fuck you-ooo!
And fuck you.
And fuck you, pretty boy.
And fuck you all
very much.
I'm outta here.
( thumps )
Have a good one!
Mrs. Jared:
Oh, everything's fine now.
No, really.
I'm terribly sorry.
- Man: Are you sure, ma'am?
- Oh, positive. Yes.
- My son isn't well.
- Yeah.
He's-- well, not well.
He's been under a lot
of stress, midterms starting...
School.
Yes, of course.
I would like another
Vodka Collins.
Eve, would you like
anything?
Yes-- well, I mean,
no, no.
Go ahead.
Get her another one.
- Please.
- Thank you, Paul.
Sure, Mom.
You know,
I think my next car
is going to be blue.
Blue, don't you think?
A very dark blue.
What do you think,
Paul?
Blue.
* Baby girl, where you at? *
* Got no strings,
got men attached *
* Can't stop that feeling
for long, no *
* You making dogs
wanna beg *
* Breaking them off
your fancy legs *
* But they make you
feel right at home, now *
* See all these illusions
just take us too long *
* And I want it bad *
* Because you walk pretty,
because you talk pretty *
* 'Cause you make me sick
and I'm not leaving *
* Till you're leaving
oh, I swear there's something
* When she's pumping
asking for a raise... *
Those are grown in shit.
* So does she want me
to buy her things? *
* On my house, on my job
on my loot, shoes *
* My shirt, my crew, my mind
my father's last name? *
* When I get you alone... *
Thank Godyou're still dealing.
So where's Lauren
She's out of town.
Do you have a thing for her
She won't put out.You know that, right
She's got this little boyfriend who she's saving herself for.
You're just wasting your time and money.
She's got a boyfriend
All these intrusions just take us too long
And I want you so bad
Because you walk city, because you talk city
'Cause you make me sick...
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes,oh, oh, oh--!
Hi, Sean.
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop.
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon...
Sean's voice Disillusionment strikes.
After all my pining for Lauren,
this-- her roommate.
The inevitable conclusion.
It's like bad poetry--and then what
I'm still hard,so I keep on going.
She's groaning now. Humping up, down, up.
Is it ever going to end
I should neverhave done this.
I should have kept it innocent.
God, oh yes.
I put my handover her mouth.
She comes, licking my palms,snorting.
It's over.
Kleenex.
What's wrong I told you I came.
I was bornin a Holiday Inn.
Better it's not Lauren. Note to self
never 'shroom again.Only gets you into trouble.
Woman I've written you this last letter
because I know I'll never have you.
I stood in a corner and watched you go off with her.
She's so beneath you.
You probably did itjust to hurt me.
Well, it worked. You hurt me,
and now there'snothing else I can do.
There won't be any more notes.It's last call.
No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know...
Know...
I can't live
If livingis without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If livingis without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore
Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows...
( rapid dripping )
I only did it with her because I'm in love with you.
( bangs )
( sobs )
( crying, sobbing )
Lauren, I love you.
Laur--
- Lauren--!- Leave, Sean!
Since when does fucking somebody else
mean that I'm not faithful to you
Lauren...
She's not ever going to want see you again.
Lara Face it...

( ringing continues )

( woman sobbing )
Victor Took a charter flighton a DC-1 0 to London,
Ianded at Heathrow.Took a cab to the city center.
Don't let people lie to you,hostels are for the ugly.
I'm staying at Home House,the most beautiful hotel.
Called a friend from school who was selling hash,
but she wasn't in. Met a couple of Brits
who take me to of all places, Camden Street.
I flirt a bit at the Virgin Megastore, buy some CDs,
then followsome girls with pink hair.
I wandered around trying to getlaid until it started to rain,
then went back to Home House. Ministry of Sound is dead,
so I go to Rem Forum,but it's Gay Night.
I find one hetero girl and wedry-hump on the dance floor.
We cab it back to Home House, I strip her clothes off
suck her toes and we fuck. Hung out for four or five days,
met the world's biggest DJ,Paul Oakenfold.
Kept missing the Changingof the Guards.
Wrote my mom a postcardI never sent, bought speed
from an Italian junkie try-in-gto sell me a stolen bike.
Smoked a lot of hash that had too much tobacco in it.
Saw the Tate. Saw Big Ben.
Ate a lot of weird English food. It rained a lot.
It was expensive and I'mjonesing-- split for Amsterdam.
The Dutch all know English soI didn't have to speak Dutch,
which was a relief. I cruisethe red light district,
visit a sex show, visit a sex museum,
smoke a lot of hash. I meet a Dutch TV actress
and we drink absint heat a bar called Absinthe.
The museums were cool. Lots of Van Goghs
and the Vermeers were intense. Wandered around,
bought a lot of pastries, ate some intense waffles.
Bought some coke and I cruisedthe red light district
I found some blonde with big-tits that reminds me of Lara.
I gave her 1 00 guilders.In the end, she pulls me out,
I come between her tits eventhough I'm wearing a rubber.
We made small talk about AIDS, her Moroccan pimp and herself.
I wake to the sound of a wino singing.
It's 8 00 a.m.and hot as blazes.
I pretend to ice-skate around Central Station.
Trade songs with a Kiwi girl, then split for Paris
Wandered the Champs-Elysées, climbed the Eiffel Tower
for only seven francs--the ticket machine was broken.
Got the hang of the Metro, took it everywhere.
Ford model party, hooked upwith a model named Karina.
She chugs my cockat the Marriott, which is good.
Played billiards, went shoppingI think she gave me mono.
Drove a Ferrari that belongedto the Saudi royal family.
Made out with a Dutch modelin front of the Louvre.
Saw the Arc de Triomphe--almost became road kill.
Oakie invites me to Dublin, I catch an Aer Lingus flight,
stay at the Morrison-- Dublinrocks like you can't imagine.
Oakenfold lets me spinsome discs with him.
Irish girls are smallas leprechauns.
I swap hickeys with a drunk woman after groping my abs
and calling me Mr. LA. She strips for me
in the bathroom of the club. Sneak into the Guinness factory
and steal some stout so good my dick goes hard.
I fly to Barcelona which is a bust.
Too many fat American students, too many lame meat markets.
I dropped acidat the Sagrada Familia,
which was a trip, to say the least.
Cruise up the coastto Museo Gala Dali,
but had no more acid, which sucked.
Some girl from Canada calls me on my cell,
so I let her listento the church bells.
Canta Cruz is beautiful but there are no girls there,
just old hippies. So I went to Switzerland
where, ironically, I couldn'tfind anyone with the time.
Took Glacier Expressto Shiltone
which is beautifulin a way I can't describe.
EuroPass into Italy, ended up in Venice,
met a hot girl who lookslike Rachel Leigh Cook,
and speaks better English than I do.
She's living for a year on only $5.00 a day.
We gondola around, buy hash. She thinks I'm a capitalist--
my room costs more for one night than her entire trip.
She doesn't mind much when I pay the bills. I ditch her
and hook up with a couple who obviously want a threesome.
Much tension, but the doofus offers to drive me to Rome,
an offer I jump at. Traffic'sbad, we're stopped for hours.
The wife's a freak. The guy wigs out on me.
It's like a Polanski film. We stop in Florence,
where I see some big dome. A bomb goes off
I lose the weird couple, which is probably for the best.
Ended up in Rome,which is big and hot and dirty.
Just like LA, but with ruins. I went to the Vatican,
which is ridiculously opulent. Stood for two hours
to get into the Sistine Chapel, which now cleaned, looks fake.
I meet two underage Italiangirls who I try to talk
into fucking each otherwhile I jack off onto them.
Bored, I buy them someice cream instead.
My hotel has a gym, so I work out.
I bump into some guy from Camden who says he knows me,
but I'm sure that he's a fag, so I lose him.
I try to fartand instead shit my pants.
In my room I masturbate and have a pain in my groin.
I dream about a beautiful girl,half in water,
stretching her lean body.She asks me if I like it.
I tell her she can clean fish with it.
I don't know what it means,but I wake well-rested,
masturbate in the shower, and check out.
Make my way back to London, hang out in Piccadilly Circus.
Swap shirts with someupper-crusty Cambridge chick.
Hers was an Agnes B.;mine, it cost me my Chanel.
She acts stuffy and prudish, but is really wild underneath.
She barely looks at my abs, though she wants to.
The next day I drop acidand get lost in the subway
for a full day and can't find my way out.
I meet a cute girl that lets me jack off onto her
as long as no come gets onto her Paul Smith coat.
We get stoned while listeningto Michael Jackson records.
The next morning, I wake up talking to myself.
I had a big bump on my headfrom flailing in my sleep.
I get my stuffand barely make my plane
back to the United States.I no longer know who I am
and I feel like the ghost of a total stranger.
So then I ended upback here.
I'm so there when school's out, you don't even know.
No, I do know. And you don't know until you do know.
And you have to go there to know.
You still fucking that girl from Hawaii-- Page
Oh, no, man. I gave up on that shit.
She had issues. I moved onto this chick named Candice.
- Yeah- She's great.
Did you fuck like a racehorse
You know it, brother.
- I met a girl.- Did you score some hot poon
It's not about that.
No...
it's about good time sand cuddling up.
She's a fag hag, right
It's cool because they're funand they like to dance.
I tell you, Victor,
I think I'm in love with this girl.
She's sweet. She's pure.
She's innocent.
She's a virgin.
Mitch How young is she
Out of the car seat, onto my meat.
If she's bleeding, I'm breeding.
If there's grass on the field, play ball, you know
Mitch Old enough to pee, old enough for me.
Yeah.

Bitchen ride. You pick the color
Yeah, and I don't want you to crash it.
I didn't realize it came in banana.
- Relax.- Mitch Oh, right. Relax.
While my car is being used to run a drug deal,
I'll just sit back and relax.
I don't give a fuck if wedo this deal or not,
but you do. Your girlfriend needs her nose candy.
Without nose candy, she won't fuck you, and you know it.
I have my terms, if you don't live up to them,
you get no pussy. So deal with it.
Looks kind of dark. Maybe nobody's home.
Rupert doesn't leave home.

that I would never forget, but in the end,
all I could think about was--
We'll be together again
I've been waiting for a long time
We're gonna be, we'regonna be together again
I've been connected to the right line
We'll be together and nobody ain't never
Gonna disconnect usor ever separate us
Or say to us you've got to... stop!

Before you make a fool out of love-- stop!

You are the one, you make it happen
The things you do are totally planned
You are the one, you're so in charge now
You're going to make a stand, make a stand
The way you speak when people leave you
It makes them want to share your goal
You're not the one in every region
You know you're in control,in control
