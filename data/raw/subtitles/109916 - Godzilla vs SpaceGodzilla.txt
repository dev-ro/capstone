The Counter-G meeting is scheduled
to begin at 1400 hours.
Sorry for the wait. This way.
I don't agree with this Project T.
We can't control Godzilla.
It's just impossible.
It's better than Project MOGERA
which aims to kill Godzilla.
We'll plant a telepathy amplifier
on the back of its head
and amplify the telepathy
you send to it.
Then we can control it.
Then we can save the world.
That's Project Telepathy,
in short, known as Project T.
Look, without your cooperation,
we'll have to use one of them.
Please. You can't do that.
You see, none of my trainees
are skilled enough yet.
Using telepathy is very
dangerous for them.
That's why we're asking you to do it.
You're pretty happy today.
What?
I said, "You're pretty happy today."
Happy, happy! I'm happy!
Sorry. It was this.
All right.
We got to climb that thing?
Let's go.
All right. You're feeling energetic.
How are you doing?
Wait up!
Hey, just wait for a minute!
I told you we got lost.
Have I ever lied to you before?
- Hey.
- What?
What's that sound?
What?
Kiyo. Come here.
Kiyo!
Koji!
Don't move.
Move and you die.
It's poisonous.
One bite and you've had it.
Put this on your wound.
Excuse me. Are you Yum'?
I'm the only one here.
Who'd you expect apart from me?
G-Force. I'm Shinjo. This is Sato.
I'm Kiyoshi Sato.
They sent you to this tiny island?
That's not promising.
You're right.
Not again.
What's that?
Little Godzilla.
Little Godzilla?
Yeah.
I don't know what they feed him,
but he's growing so big.
For a baby, I mean.
What's going on here? Are you friends?
He's just fond of me.
Well, it's not a feast,
but still, it'll be good.
Thank you, all,
for making it here on
such a short notice.
We would like to discuss about NASA's
missing exploratory vessel.
Your Earth is facing a crisis.
A terrible space monster is
now approaching the Earth.
But why Earth?
It's here to kill Godzilla.
If Godzilla is killed,
Earth can be easily conquered.
Please protect your
planet from this monster.
We beg you to protect it.
Ms. Saegusa.
So have you decided yet?
We should've brought MOGERA.
And then,
we could've dug holes
with no problem at all.
What's that old soul thinking?
Don't ask me.
Yuki, did you get in touch with
Professor Gondo at G-Institute?
Put these in the holes.
There's one for each hole.
Is your radio working?
None of your business.
What are these tubes for?
I'll tell you.
We're going to plant tear gas mines.
What's the target?
Godzilla, of course.
He's shown up twice now
since I've been here.
Out of the ocean.
Can these mines destroy the monster?
There are many devices.
But all the gadgets around here
are only good for practice.
But this one.
This'll destroy it.
What is it?
It's a special handmade bullet.
It contains blood coagulant.
Coagulant?
Yeah.
He's got a weak zone,
a place on his body that he can't protect.
Right here.
That's where I'm going to...
aim that bullet.
If you help me to kill Godzilla,
you'll go down in history.
We can't.
We came here to work on Project T.
Why do you want to control it like
some sort of radio-controlled toy?
Unidentified object
is approaching fast!
To the space control room.
Object approaching Earth.
Warning. Object approaching Earth.
Switch to the satellite
space telescope.
Yes, sir.
It's approaching at great speed!
Okay. Zoom right in.
The ultimate counter-Godzilla weapon.
Chief.
Ready yet?
Yeah. I'm sure it is.
The United Nations has requested us
to destroy the monster using MOGERA.
But Godzilla?
We'll use Project T for Godzilla.
Project T? It's not ready!
The team's on the way.
I'm Shinjo from G-Force.
I'm Sato.
I'm Okubo. Counter-G Committee.
Evolution biologist.
This is Professor Gondo,
biotechnologist.
Chinatsu Gondo. Hello.
Hi, there.
It's a pleasure.
And Miss Saegusa, chief psychic.
I've got a question for you.
What is it that you love
so much about Godzilla?
Well, I'm not sure you'd understand.
You all think the only way
out of this is to kill him.
Please. Just leave Godzilla alone.
You won't be disgraced
if you quit now.
Humans survive...
by doing what they have to do,
not by giving up.
What are you making?
It's a bullet full of blood coagulant.
I call it Yuki's special.
So you ordered all kinds of
medicines from me to make this?
Kiyo, come on!
- Ready?
- Yeah.
What's going on!
What's that?
It's tear gas!
Look.
Stupid thing.
Little Godzilla.
It's all Yuki's fault.
I think he's become a little
attached to that monster.
Can't say I blame him.
What's the matter?
It's moving.
You mean Godzilla?
Miss Gondo, let's start Project T now.
Right.
Good.
Check the line, can you?
We're ready.
Come on.
It's Godzilla! Hurry up!
- Keep it running.
- Ok.
Godzilla's shown up.
Let's go get him. Hurry up.
Better be sure you hit him.
There's no second chance.
Shoot it!
What the... Wait!
Oncoming. Let me see it now...
that lovely armpit of yours.
We got to get behind him.
Right. Get ready. Here we go!
Get him. The back of his head.
Come on. Turn around for me.
- Bull's-eye.
- Cool.
Damn!
The amplifier is in position.
Understood. Good work.
Send a message to Godzilla now.
I'll try to make him walk.
It's working.
Synchronization has been confirmed.
Start sending the telepathy.
Tent to beach.
Keep your eyes on Godzilla.
Roger.
Tent to beach.
Tell me. What's Godzilla doing now?
It worked.
Now he's heading slowly
towards the cape.
I'll get you.
I've lost my instruments.
Maybe it's the space monster.
Prepare for battle now.
Plasma laser. Fire!
What was that?
Fuselage damage.
It's time for you to die.
My laser cannons don't work!
Backup circuit check!
It's coming straight at us!
It's intersecting!
Laser cannon. Auto pursue!
We've been hit. Can't fight!
Let's get out of here!
Joystick is jammed.
We're losing control!
Doctor!
Amplify the signal.
Right.
That's maximum.
Don't do that!
Miki! Miki!
Mr. Shinjo, this is Gondo.
Come back immediately!
What's the matter?
A space monster is coming.
What's that?
Koji!
Koji. It's Godzilla.
He's moving again.
Luck is finally on our side.
If MOGERA will be busy with the monster,
who would fight him?
- We've got to do this.
- Right.
That's why you don't
understand why I like him.
All you want to do is to fight.
Yuki!
Don't try and stop me, or you'll taste
Yuki's special yourself, all right?
You had it wrong.
We're here to help you out.
Don't shoot him!
We need to have Godzilla alive.
It's the space monster, Mr. Fuyuki.
That is the space monster.
He looks like Godzilla.
Yuki!
I think it's had enough of a bad day.
Miss Gondo, Project T has failed.
It's failed?
What do you mean?
Well, the pyschotronic
generator can't do much.
It's my decision.
Let's go back.
I'll stay here.
I'm worried about
Godzilla and the baby.
I know, but it's too
dangerous to stay here.
I'll be all right.
Yuki.
What about the tent?
I'll be back again.
Hey, Kiyo.
Get out.
Why?
Yuki, we're going to stay here.
Yeah.
All right.
Okay then. Take care.
On the right are Godzilla's cells.
They're known as G-cells.
And on the left are the skin cells
from the monster collected by MOGERA.
The space monster has
exactly the same G-cells.
Therefore,
we named it SpaceGodzilla.
There were only two occasions when
G-cells were sent into outer space.
One, a fragment of Biollante.
And two, Godzilla's flesh
attached to Mothra.
One of these cells must
have been swallowed by
a black hole and pushed
out from a white hole.
It assimilated crystal organisms
during its rapid evolution and
was exposed to tremendous energies
from the explosions of stars.
And finally, the most
horrific monster was born.
That's the theory.
That's another reason that...
we're already trying to boost MOGERA.
Thank you for waiting.
You know, too many stupid meetings
can change a man's look.
You used to look dignified, Mr. Aso,
back when you were...
my superior officer.
I'm not as free and easy as you are.
Some things do change.
So, what do you want me to do for you?
Project T has failed.
Okubo is no longer
with the G-Committee.
So the only option now is Project M.
Will you pilot MOGERA?
I didn't want to have
to ask you, but...
You're the only person
who can do this.
So then?
Don't worry.
If you have the power to bring
about the meeting of minds...
you can beat the space monster.
You're right.
This beautiful Earth is the
property of every living being.
Who were you talking to?
I'm a little worried.
Godzilla's vibrations are weak.
Godzilla again?
Don't you think about anything else?
For instance...
maybe someone you love?
Life would be sad without love.
Not as sad as if you think
about fighting all the time!
Don't you understand?
He also has feelings.
He has feelings the same as we do!
Kiyo! Report to Counter-G!
Can you tell me who kidnapped Miki?
Got any idea?
Come on. Answer me.
I do.
But I will tell you later.
Yuki's on a new project.
Things may change
depending on its result.
A new project?
I can't get along with that guy.
All he does is talk about Godzilla.
His best friend was
killed just recently,
while fighting Godzilla.
His name was Goro Gondo. My brother.
After his death,
Yuki became obsessed with Godzilla.
Can you see a warehouse with a
sign saying Pacific something?
Yeah.
Well, it looks like a warehouse but
in fact it's the Japanese mafia.
There's no way in.
Barriers everywhere.
We've already input your telepathy
waves into the central computer.
Now, we're gonna amplify them
and send them to Godzilla.
Then I'll be able to control him.
Why are you doing this?
Destruction.
That's what Godzilla's about,
isn't he?
Again! Come on!
- Come on. Another one!
- Here.
Hit me again.
Chief! Can't we go home now?
You're costing me too much.
Oh, come on.
I've just gotta win a
doll for my young one.
Just one more time!
No, you can't! Let's go home!
- It's a monster!
- Monster!
- Run!
- It's a monster!
Chief! I won't go home.
I don't wanna see a monster.
I'm afraid of monsters.
I don't wanna go home!
Hurry!
Stay back!
Here!
Shinjo!
Are you hurt?
I'm all right.
What was that?
Telekinesis.
Telekinesis?
I've just never tried it before.
What's up?
SpaceGodzilla.
Koji! Where's Okubo?
Yuki! SpaceGodzilla. We have to go!
Here. Put this on.
I didn't expect this.
My dear...
What went wrong?
Why is this happening?!
It passed Yamagata.
So I don't think Tokyo can escape it.
The third type alert!
All the members of MOGERA in position.
SpaceGodzilla is approaching Tokyo.
What's Yuki doing?
Well, we can't find him.
Find him immediately.
Yes, sir.
SpaceGodzilla is flying
from Romeo one to two.
Find Yuki immediately!
It's coming this way!
They're ready to attack, sir.
I guess Suzuki will lead the crew.
Damn Yuki.
Hey! What are you waiting for?
- It's hooked.
- Keep it. It's yours.
Now look. It got away.
What's that?
Come in, please!
This is Nakano Island,
calling headquarters.
It's a monster!
Hurry!
Wait for me!
Use all the capabilities of
MOGERA and destroy SpaceGodzilla.
That's your mission.
Understand?
Yes, sir!
What are you playing at?
We got here in time, didn't we?
So where is he?
In Fukuoka.
Commander!
Yuki.
I'll leave it with you.
Do you want to go or not?
Yes, sir.
Go.
Yuki!
You told me...
you live because there's
something you just can't give up.
I have that one thing, too.
This is out of gas.
Fill it for me?
- Let's go.
- Roger.
Some white things are
coming out there!
Run!
Our Fukuoka City,
once a peaceful town...
is now turning into
unimaginable hell on Earth!
Oh, my God! A huge building
is just being destroyed.
Can you hear its roar
making the air ring?
How powerful and loud!
Its energy is streaming
toward the crystal bodies.
Just keep streaming!
A tremendous mass of light!
It's pouring around the
Fukuoka Tower which now
looks as if he's made it
into his own fortress.
Godzilla is now in Kagoshima Bay.
Kagoshima?
Godzilla sighted at Kagoshima Bay.
All personnel intercept.
Stop it now.
We gotta set up a defense line.
Right.
This is G-Center.
Godzilla's landed at Kagoshima.
Sending visual.
It's going towards the ocean!
Godzilla's is passing Sierra 5.
Godzilla. It's going through Kyushu.
It's heading towards SpaceGodzilla.
MOGERA diverted from specified course.
Now heading towards Godzilla.
What is Yuki doing?
Come in, MOGERA.
Where are you going?
- This is G-Center.
- He's going to Fukuoka.
Come in, do you read me?
It's Godzilla!
Godzilla is nearing the park.
Please evacuate immediately.
Godzilla is nearing the park.
MOGERA, confirm your position.
- Yuki.
- MOGERA!
- Get back on course now.
- Can you hear us?
Look, you don't give the
orders around here.
- Just keep quiet and do your job.
- You're off course.
We're not here as your
puppets, God damn it!
Godzilla!
Yuki!
Yuki.
Excuse me.
Kiyo.
Oh, boy. More violence.
How typical.
That's why your superiors
don't like you very much.
MOGERA, SpaceGodzilla is in...
We wouldn't have been
able to do a good job.
If we care what our superiors say.
So true.
Kiyo, let's do it.
Now entering battle zone.
The very strong
electromagnetic wave is...
Hey, what's wrong?
Electrical wave disturbance!
Hey, check the lines in Kyushu!
Yes, sir!
Apparently, it's some
kind of energy zone.
I see.
Plasma laser. Fire.
Continuous fire!
Get behind him.
Okay.
- We did it.
- Yeah.
- It's Godzilla!
- Godzilla is here!
- This way!
- Hurry!
Plasma laser cannon. Ready.
Fire!
Good. Drill attack, now.
MOGERA, don't let us down now!
Kiyo, pull away from him.
Right. Roller system on.
This is Fukuoka Police Department.
Please follow the officers' directions.
Evacuate to the Ohbori Park.
Shinjo! Can you hear me?
SpaceGodzilla's coming. Shinjo!
Sato! Are you dead?
Let's take off. Power it up.
Right.
Open up the afterburner.
Roger.
Weapon systems are dead!
- Climb up and fix it.
- Right!
Hurry! Go!
Here comes Godzilla.
You're gonna need my help.
You might as well untie me now.
Kiyo, untie him.
Hurry!
I fixed it!
Kiyo, he's destroying
the crystal objects.
SpaceGodzilla is drawing
energy from the tower...
and absorbing it through
the crystal objects.
It wants to destroy them...
to stop the supply of energy.
I understand now.
SpaceGodzilla chose
Fukuoka to use the tower.
I'll ride the Star Falcon.
Yuki.
I don't wanna get knocked down again.
What are you gonna do?
Our enemy is SpaceGodzilla.
The key is that tower.
Okay.
Everyone, stand back.
- Excuse me!
- Let us through.
It doesn't look good.
- Ladies, you can't come through here.
- You have to let us through!
It's dangerous!
- We're in a hurry!
- Hold it!
Get in!
This is Land MOGERA.
We're helping Godzilla to destroy
the tower from underground.
Well, good luck.
Underground!
- Look for a weak point.
- Got it.
- There it is.
- Good work.
Shinjo, what are you waiting for?
I'm going in!
Damn reptile!
Are you getting there?
We're at the target.
Here we go.
Fire!
Damn you.
You want to protect the tower
with your life, do you?
Asshole.
Koji!
Well done, Shinjo.
I'm backing you up.
Listen, Land MOGERA.
We'll finish him with MOGERA as one.
Okay.
MOGERA docking mode. Set
Docking mode.
Course confirmed.
Full Throttle!
You saved us.
Let's land.
- Landing.
- Roger.
They're still fighting.
Guys, are you having fun?
Let's kill SpaceGodzilla first.
Use all weapons.
Roger.
Hey, he's biting him.
He's blocking SpaceGodzilla's energy.
Godzilla's smarter than we thought.
Get ready. Spiral grenade missiles.
Spiral grenade missiles. Fire!
Plasma laser cannon. Fire!
Left arm damage!
Never mind!
Weapons power decreasing!
Engine power decreasing!
Can we move laterally?
The switch won't work.
Damn it!
The booster won't work either.
Hey. Get in the escape hatch.
- Hurry.
- Right.
- Abandon ship.
- How about you?
You guys go ahead.
We can't leave him.
You're the reason I'm alive.
I'm gonna send you back to hell,
back where you belong.
By myself.
Can't let that SpaceGodzilla
beat you now.
Godzilla.
I'm glad you're still alive.
Damn it!
You're not so easy to kill.
Damn you.
- Where's MOGERA?
- Can't see it!
- Let's find it.
- Yeah.
Miki.
I was worried.
About Godzilla?
And about you.
Where's Yuki?
Koji!
MOGERA!
Yuki.
Koji! Stay here.
Damn!
Yuki!
Damn fool!
What are you doing here? Get out!
How can I leave you here?
Godzilla is emitting energy.
You know what'll happen.
When the energy overloads,
SpaceGodzilla will explode.
Here, grab this.
Everything's gonna blow up,
all the way to Bass Island.
Well, in that case,
I'll get blown up, too.
You're stupid.
SpaceGodzilla's dying.
Take cover! Move it!
Quickly!
Miss Saegusa!
Can you hear me, Koji?
This is Miki.
I'm using telepathic signals
to communicate with you.
Let me see things through your eyes.
Concentrate your attention,
and you can do it.
Yuki!
Over here!
Koji!
Yuki!
Koji.
Damn it!
Koji!
We have visual again.
This is the Battle Headquarter.
Can you hear us, Fukuoka?
- Report us the situation.
- How about SpaceGodzilla?
Report the current conditions.
Godzilla.
MOGERA?
That Yuki.
- This way.
- Yes.
Shinjo!
Thank you.
You did great.
Koji!
You made it!
Yuki.
Godzilla.
Yuki?
Do you still consider
Godzilla as your enemy?
Well, he's a great creature,
after all.
I think I had enough of him.
I think SpaceGodzilla
feels the same way.
Since it did develop
from the same G-cells.
That thing was so strong and powerful.
But what the hell was it?
A monster.
Developed only from the
vicious genes of G-cells.
If the universe keeps
being polluted...
well, then, another space
monster will arrive pretty soon.
It was a warning to mankind.
Thank you.
Your mission was a success.
You saved planet Earth.
What's up?
Nothing at all.
Hey.
Let them do the rest.
Let's go and get a drink.
This is your hometown.
Godzilla!
I still have something
to settle with you!
He wasn't that bad, that Godzilla.
Do men always need to fight
first to understand each other?
That's our charm.
Hey.
Close your eyes.
Please.
