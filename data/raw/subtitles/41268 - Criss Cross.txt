Anna.
Steve, I had to see you.
He'll get wise. The last
minute, you'll ruin everything.
I slipped out.
He was dancing.
Oh, Steve,
I keep thinking and thinking.
Will you just
not think about it?
I'm so worried about you.
I'm all sick inside.
Oh, if it was only all over now.
If it was only this time tomorrow.
You know what to do?
Have you got it right?
Suppose you get hurt.
Remember, you'll go to the
cottage at Palos Verdes.
Suppose something goes
wrong. You'll wait there.
It'll take time. A few
weeks. Why do you say weeks?
Why not days? Just stay at
the house at Palos Verdes.
Don't try to get in touch with anyone.
Don't do anything until I get there.
I'll hate it. I'll hate it every
minute until you're with me again.
You better get back before
he starts lookin' for ya.
I don't want him to see the
two of us coming in together.
Go on back.
Steve.
All those things
that happened to us--
everything that went before--
you'll forget it.
You'll see.
I'll make you forget it.
After it's done, after it's
all over and we're safe,
it'll bejust you and me.
You and me, the way it should've
been all along from the start.
Be careful.
Why, yes, indeed,
Mr. Dundee.
Just a few moments ago
I noticed her pass by.
I didn't ask, did you
notice her pass by?
I asked, did you know where
she went? Well, no, no.
I just didn't-- Oh!
There she is, Mr. Dundee.
Now there is Mrs. Dundee.
Where have you been? Outside.
Just a minute. What do
you mean, ''outside''?
In the parking lot. What'd
you go out there for?
Because it looked like rain. I wanted to
tell the boy to put the top up on the car.
Why'd you have to
go yourself?
Because I had the car keys. I had to
give the keys to the boy, didn't I?
Why didn't you send a waiter?
Or Waxie or one of the fellas?
What are you asking me questions
for? Why don't you answer them?
Will you shut up
and leave me alone?
What are you lookin' at? Nothin'.
Anybody ask you to stick
around and get an earful?
No, you see, I was
just-- Get outta here!
Yes, Mr. Dundee.
Thank you, Mr. Dundee.
This rotten line
of work.
The rotten class of people
you have to put up with.
Good evening, folks.
Good evening.
How are you tonight? Table
for four, huh? Follow me.
Why don't you go outside, Steve, and
find some other place down the street?
What's the matter with
this place, Lieutenant?
Pete.
The name is Pete.
I'm your friend. You know what's
the matter with this place.
He's giving a farewell party, isn't
he? I just dropped in to say good-bye.
He didn't invite you.
The way you know everything.
Look, they're goin' to Detroit.
Let them go.
Be intelligent. Stay outta
there. Stay outta trouble.
Why should there be
trouble? Who's kidding who?
You walk in there and two minutes
later, you'll start swinging.
The way you know everything.
The way you got it all figured out!
There'll be a fight. You gonna pull
me in? You gonna send me up too?
All right, forget it.
Just excuse me for getting nosy.
That's all right, Lieutenant.
That's your business.
Go on, honey.
Go on out and dance.
But I don't wanna dance. Go
on. Find yourself a partner.
Take the girls
to the powder room, Harriet.
What for? I just
fixed my face.
Go on, dear. Beat it.
See ya later, baby.
Hello, Stevie. Glad you
were able to make it.
Frank, if they're gonna fight
in there, why don't you stop it?
Not me. I never butt in.
These days, it don't pay.
You can't have people brawling
around. Gives the place a bad name.
- Pretty soon, nobody will want to come in.
- You'll come in.
You're my best customer,
morn till night.
She sits on that stool so much that, frankly,
someday I think she's gonna get stuck to it.
Hey, I thought Mr. Thompson
was a friend of yours.
Aw, let them punch their
heads off. I give it up.
I don't care anymore.
You always wanted to get Slim
Dundee. Now's your chance.
What do you mean? He's
got a knife on him.
I didn't say nothin' now,
remember.
Just a friendly argument,
Lieutenant. Just scufflin' around.
This is too good
to be true, Slim.
I was hoping to get something
on you before you left town.
This is between me and Dundee.
I'm not swearin' out any complaints.
You sure you know
what you wanna do?
This is just between
him and me.
You didn't happen to see anything,
did you, Walt?
Not a thing.
Neither did you,
Vincent, huh?
Anna, who pulled
the knife?
What's-a matter with you,
Lieutenant?
She's his wife.
You can't get a wife to testify
against her husband.
Everybody knows that.
Can I go out now
and wash up?
Is that okay with you,
Lieutenant?
Go and wash.
Go to... Detroit.
If you should happen to change
your mind before he leaves--
I'll let you know,
Lieutenant.
Chump!
What happened? He didn't come down
here tonight to have a real fight.
It was supposed to be a phony.
Strictly for the cop's benefit.
What went wrong? Why did you
have to pull a knife, Slim?
He flared up. In the middle of everything he
started to ask a bunch of screwball questions.
What time did he
come in here tonight?
Where was he?
Was he in the parking lot?
The parking lot?
Don't be foolish, Slim.
Let bygones be bygones.
Do you realize how much dough there's
gonna be in that truck tomorrow morning?
In six figures.
Six figures.!
This is no time
to be sore and blow up.
Why should you throw away
the only chance of a lifetime?
After all the plannin',
all the hopin'.
What I say is, let's not be foolish.
I say, let's go right ahead.
Don't you realize
it's even better now?
That cop in there, he'll never guess in a
million years you both are in a deal together.
Chance of a lifetime.
Six figures, Slim.
I went off my head.
I appreciate it,
what you told the cop.
That's the way to talk!
That's the ticket!
What about the third man on the truck?
Don't forget you gotta do the driving.
Can you get rid
of that third man?
Don't worry. I'll get rid of
him. I'll be doing the driving.
Then it's all okay.
It's on.
Sure. That's the ticket!
That's the way to be!
Boys, excuse me, but I
got a date with my baby!
I had to lay down
the law.
I told my wife, ''No more
ordering on the telephone.''
But it's legitimate. The store
charges for delivery service.
I know, but compare.
Soap powder:
43 cents on the telephone.
At the Great Western Market,
37 cents.
Six cents difference, huh? Tomato
juice: Two cans for a quarter.
At the Western,
1 9 cents.
- Yeah, I see your point.
- You bet your life. It all adds up.
Hiya, Bailey.
Hello, Bailey.
Hello, Pappy. Pop. Hiya, Andy.
Where's Thompson? Isn't he
working today? He's working.
Steve's
the outside man.
We were discussing the
difference in shopping prices.
There's one woman that knows how to
shop. Steve's mother, Mrs. Thompson.
She serves the best. Since my
wife died, I'm a guest there often.
Okay.
Here you are.
Well, so long, Chester. So long, Pappy.
- So long.
- Now my wife.
I don't know how much she spends
on the house. She's extravagant.
Beach in the summertime. Uses up
all my razor blades shaving her legs.
I don't get sore.
She's for me.
I love that kid.
Bailey. Which one of you
is Bailey? Who wants me?
Your office just called. Your wife isn't
feeling well. You gotta go straight home.
The office said it was okay. My wife?
Hey, Steve.
Yeah? What is it?
My wife's sick. You two guys
can manage without me, can't you?
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
I'll do the driving.
I'll catch the bus
at Olympic.
I better go right out there.
Steve.
Yeah?
I'm worried about
that phone call.
I don't like the smell
of the whole thing.
Do you? It's strictly
against regulation.
Don't worry about regulations.
Man's wife got sick.
I understand that,
but a phone call.
Steve, I really think
maybe we oughta check it.
We got a schedule to make. Yes.
But there's supposed to be
three of us on the truck.
With a load
like we got today--
What do you want me to do? Find a phone
booth someplace and stop and call the office?
Anything you say.
No, go on, drive.
We'd be late.
Relax. Everything's
gonna be all right.
I don't know, Steve.
I guess you're right. I guess
I'm just kinda nervous lately.
Sure. Take it easy. You got
a long ride ahead of you.
It's a 40-minute run to San
Rafelo. Yeah, that's right.
After it's done, after it's
all over and we're safe,
it'll bejust you and me.
You and me, the way it should've
been all along from the start.
From the start.
The beginning.
It all happened so fast.
It was only eight months ago
that I came back.
I came home.
The Los Angeles sun was shining,
the way it's always supposed to.
The old trolley line looked the same--
the old street, the old houses.
I was glad to be back.
I'd been all over
the country.
I connected with
a trucking outfit in Chicago.
Did construction work down South.
Drifted around the Oklahoma oil fields.
Jobs like that,
one after the other.
Until finally I got her
out of my system.
I didn't come back
on account ofher.
It had nothing to do with it.
I wasn't gonna go looking for her,:
I didn't expect to run into her.
I didn't particularly
want to see her.
I was sure of that
if I was sure of anything.
But then from the start,
it all went one way.
It was in the cards
or it was fate...
or a jinx or whatever
you wanna call it.
But right from the start.
Attaboy!
Ya glad to see me, Corky?
Huh? How are ya, huh?
Where's Mom and Slade? Mom go shoppin' again,
or is she out gabbin' with the neighbors?
Which is it? Say something,
you funny-lookin' little mutt.
Can't ya talk?
All right. You stay here
and watch my bag.
Stay here and watch it.
I'll be back later.
Now watch it.
Watch it.
Attaboy.
I went down to the drugstore
to call up Ramirez.
Pete Ramirez. We grew up
together. He was an old friend.
I thought I might drop over
and kill an hour.
But it all went one way
that sunny afternoon.
In the cards.
He was out.
His wife told me he was away
somewhere, working on thejob.
Pete always had the night shift, but
this afternoon he was on day duty.
This particular afternoon.
And then, somehow,
there I was, in the Round-Up.
The old place.
The old hangout.
There I was, all right,
looking for her,
whether I felt like
admitting it to myself or not.
A little strange to see
the place in the daytime.
Empty, quiet, dim.
We put in a lot of evenings here,
Anna and I.
Howdy.
Howdy.
You wanted something?
A beer?
You the new man
around here?
Depends on what
ya mean by ''new.''
Where's Harry?
Harry who?
Harry. Used to be the bartender.
Worked here.
Must've been before my time. Oh.
Ya want a beer?
Does the, uh-- Does the old
crowd still come in here?
Lots of people
come in here nighttimes.
Depends on which
''old crowd'' ya mean.
Tell me, do you know--
Yeah. Hey, mister.
You looking for
some special party?
No. No, I'm not
looking for anybody.
Then what are you?
A checker?
Well, what's a checker? Are you an
investigator for the state liquor board?
- I never even heard of them.
- Well, if you're not lookin' for anybody,
and if you're not a checker
like you say you're not,
what are you tryin' to strike up
a conversation for?
Let's have
some nickels, huh?
Swell-looking, well-built
man like that, a checker.
Hot tip.
Hot tip, please.
I think I'll have
that beer now.
If you're not a checker,
then I apologize.
But if it turns out
that you are a snooper,
then I want
an apology outta you.
I think I got that right
comin' to me, ain't I?
Oh, so unlucky.
Too late.
Too late.
Hot tip won $1 6.
But too late!
Well, for cryin' out loud!
I call up the house, and outta
the blue sky, Eve tells me--
Yeah, that's right.
How are ya, Pete? Fine.
I come right down. I knew I'd
find you here. You did? How come?
This is your old hangout. This is
where you and Anna always used to go.
I'm not here
lookin' for Anna.
You come back to town on
her account, didn't you?
Why, no. Well, then
why did you come back?
You know,
all of a sudden like that?
Well, Mom's gettin' along
and then there's the kid, Slade.
He's runnin' around with some
girl. He wants to get married.
I thought I'd come home and get my old
job back, take care of the house. See?
Yeah, I see.
You want a beer?
No, thanks. Say, I'm not
stopping you, am I?
Stopping me from what? Didn't
you want to use the phone?
The phone?
No, why?
Well, nothing. I just noticed those
nickels in your hand, that's all.
The way you know everything.
The way you figure it all out.
That's for the beer.
Well, Peter, I hate to break things
up, but Mom oughta be home by now.
I oughta be getting along.
I'll see you later, huh?
Let me drive you home. I got the
car outside. Oh, it's all right.
I insist. City pays for it
anyway. It's such a bother.
No bother. Fella comes
home, been away a whole year.
Wants to see his mother.
Can't wait to see his brother.
Good old Steve. I'll
take ya right to the door.
I'll go to Horten's
in the morning, Mom.
Pop thinks I can get
my old job back.
Then I'll take care of the house,
same as I always did.
- That's the only reason I came home.
- Sure, Mrs. Thompson.
That's the reason. What
else? You're all set, Slade.
Go on and get married.
Hey, wait a minute.
I don't want to get
hooked into anything.
Just don't rush me.
I might get a better offer.
Well, honestly!
The way you talk.
I realize you're supposed to be
kidding, but I wish you wouldn't.
Don't mind him.
When they tease you like that...
what they really want
to do is pinch you,
only they know it's
not nice in public.
Why don't you go with the children,
Steve, and take in a picture show?
My first night? Don't
stay home on my account.
I'll only go to sleep
in a little while.
Sure, Steve. Why don't you come with us?
No, thanks. I don't think
I feel like a movie tonight.
You want to go
bowling?
No, I'm no bowler,
Pop.
Hey, Steve.
Were you gonna call somebody
up or something? Who, me?
Well, you keep looking
over at the telephone.
Oh, do I?
I didn't realize.
Say, where's
the evening papers?
Ah.
Look, Steve, I still have
your old ice skates.
What do you say we go to the
Ice Palace and have some fun?
What is this? I came home to
settle down, not to go ice-skating.
Leave me alone. All I wanna do is lie
around the house and read the paper.
Go on, both of you. Beat it. Brute!
I'll do the dishes, Helen.
Never mind. Go ahead.
Let me help you, Mrs.
Thompson. Thank you.
Excuse me.
Hey. Psst.
Steve!
Oh!
Anna. We were married.
About two years ago.
It lasted seven months.
A man eats an apple. He gets a piece
of the core stuck between his teeth.
He tries to work it out with some
cellophane off a cigarette pack.
What happens? The cellophane
gets stuck in there too.
Anna.
What was the use?
I knew one way or the other
I'd wind up seeing her that night.
Steve.!
Oh, Steve, if you knew how
many times a day I think of you.
How are you?
When did you get back?
Why didn't you
answer my letter?
Your letter? Yeah.
Well, you got it, didn't
you? Yeah, I got it.
Well, why didn't
you write? Well, I--
I-I-I guess I never
had anything to say.
Oh, Steve! A fella can't write if
he's got nothing to say, can he?
When did you get back?
A couple of days ago.
I don't know. A week. A week,
and you never called me up?
Steve, did you come in here tonight
to see me? Is that why you're here?
- I was just passin' by.
- Oh! Like that!
I saw the old place and I thought
I'd drop in and have a look around.
I guess I figured I'd see ya.
All the fun we used to have
in this place, remember?
All the good times
we had together? Yeah.
And all the fights.
Ha-ha! The fights we had.
Boy, we sure used to go
'round and 'round.
What did we ever have to fight
about anyway? It was crazy.
We were in love,
weren't we?
I guess you can't fight with
anyone unless you really like 'em.
Wouldn't be
much fun, would it?
- Then we'd make up.
- We'd make up.
Those were times,
weren't they, Steve?
That was the best part, I think.
The making up part.
Excuse me.
You're sitting in my chair.
You runnin' around
with him?
Steve, this is Slim Dundee.
I know him.
He's a well-known man.
Steve Thompson.
You wanna join us?
No, we just ran into each other and
stopped to say hello, that's all.
Well, so long.
Wait a minute, Steve.
What? You'll give me a ring, won't you?
Sure, sure. We'll probably run into each
other now and then. Why shouldn't we?
Here you are, Pop. Papers
from the bonding company.
Sign 'em
and I'm all set.
How did he make out on the
gun range,Johnny? Did he pass?
Two eighty-nine out of
a possible three hundred.
Two eighty-nine? I don't know
how you ever got along without me.
Pip, pip.
Look at him go.
I can still shoot rings
around you any day in the week.
Oh, reading glasses.
Used for reading purposes only.
I've got perfect eyesight.
All the doctors remark on it.
Here they come.
You got a defense
against an aerial holdup?
They're liable to start coming
at you someday with a helicopter.
I'll tell ya something.
Nobody ever got away with a heist
on an armored truck in 28 years.
As a matter of fact,
they don't even try anymore.
You hear that, Pop?
The deal is off.
Holy smokes.!
Is that you, Thompson?
Are you comin' back to work here?
Figured you guys needed a hand.
Holy smokes! They're takin' Thompson
back. Company's goin' to the dogs.
What do you wanna sit around
inside these armored trucks for?
Take O'Hearn.
He's got the jitters.
He goes out to Catalina, spends his
two-week vacation in a glass-bottomed boat...
so he can look out four
directions at the same time.
Hey, Walter.
How's the wife?
My wife? She's at the beach.
We took a place down at Balboa.
See, she thinks she's run-down,
needs a change.
Actually, she likes
to take sunbaths.
All women are nuts
about gettin' sunburned.
I don't care. I indulge her.
I'm not picayune.
Steve, you used to
have a wife, didn't you?
Whatever happened
to her? How is she?
Well, so long, Pop,
and thanks a lot.
So long, fellas.
I'll see ya all soon.
So long.
Yeah, take it easy.
I certainly made no hit with
that crack about his wife, did I?
Well, you know how it is. He's divorced,
but he's still got her in his bones.
I guess it takes some time.
Oh, but it's all finished.
Now don't get me wrong.
He's all through with it.
There's no question about that.
That's just like you, calling me up at my
house from a drugstore around the corner.
You're sore?
Keep eatin' that stuff, you're
gonna get as fat as a horse.
Steve, I wanna
tell you something.
That fellow, Dundee?
Slim Dundee?
He just asked me for a date.
He just took me out, that's all.
Eat your lunch
these days?
Come on, Steve.
Come on what?
You can be a nice guy
when you want to.
I don't think
you eat your lunch.
I think you still spend your money
on costume jewelry junk instead.
Just like old times.
What's like old times?
Bawling me out. Only this time
in front of a drugstore counter.
I'm not sore because you
went out with somebody.
It's perfectly all right.
It's none of my business.
What do you expect me to do,
sit home and mope?
I didn't mean to do anything wrong.
''I didn't mean to do anything wrong.''
Half the time you don't know
what you're doin'.
Trouble is you always know
what you want.
If you're
gonna get nasty.
Workin' these days?
I get jobs.
Department stores, selling.
What'd you want?
I mean, why'd you call me up?
- Do you have to ask?
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I made the first move, Steve.
You don't have to be proud.
What's being proud
got to do with it?
Do you think I like
meeting you like this?
Don't you think I know what
went on in your mother's mind...
when she heard
my voice on the phone?
Oh, Steve, when I
sent you that letter,
and then when I saw you
back in town, I thought--
Well, I hoped--
We'd get together again?
Yeah, Steve.
Why not?
Take in the races, the shows?
Start goin' around again?
We could try,
couldn't we?
Maybe even
get married again.
It happens.
Lots of divorced people--
Then we start fightin'
like cats and dogs.
The same old business all over again.
What's the use, Anna? You know you.
Steve! We tried it once
before. It didn't work out.
Wait a minute. I'm not blamin'
you. Maybe it was my fault.
Maybe it was nobody's fault. Whatever it
is, why don't we let it go and call it a day.
Every time we get together,
there's nothing but trouble.
All right, Steve.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I know.
You're sorry.
Good-bye.
So long.
Can't you see what you're doin'
runnin' around with people like Dundee?
Sooner or later, he'll break your
neck. Thanks for taking an interest.
You're welcome.
Wait a minute.
- What?
- I got the day off Saturday. I'm goin' swimmin'.
Are you?
I'm goin' up
to Azuma Beach.
Azuma? Where's that? Up
the coast, past Malibu.
What's the difference where
it is? You wanna go along?
Oh, sure, sure. We'll
fight on the beach at Azuma.
Don't get so funny.
I'm leavin' early.
For once in your life
you'll have to get up early.
Don't worry. I can get up
early. Be ready at 6:00.
I'll be ready, Steve.
You know I'll be ready.
Hello, Mom. Well, that's
a nice thing to do.
Make believe
you didn't catch me.
What are you all excited
about? I'm goin' out.
You been goin' out every night
since you got back.
What happened? Get
yourself a new girlfriend?
You're my girlfriend.
That's very sweet. Thanks.
But I don't see you taking me to the
nightclubs and to the movies lately.
You gotta wait your turn. You know,
Steve, you're a very nice-looking boy.
Out of all the girls
in Los Angeles,
why did you
have to pick on her?
Who?
Who? Anna.
Oh, do you think
you can fool me?
Don't I know why you came back
in the first place?
Don't worry, Mom. If I wasn't
your mother, I wouldn't worry.
She's all right.
She's just young.
Some ways she knows
more than Einstein.
- You sit around watching me like I was a
ten-year-old kid. - How old do you think you are?
I've voted for two
presidents already.
Aw, look, Mom.
You don't understand.
What makes you think
I don't understand?
I understand.
A girl puts on a piece of silk,
and the next thing that happens a young fellow
like you is sure he knows what he's doing.
You don't know
anything about her.
You had trouble
with her once, didn't you?
Let's forget it. There's
nothing you can do anyway.
Nothing?
I spoke to Pete.
Well, what can he do?
Plenty. He's a detective.
Look. You, Pete, the whole Los
Angeles Police Department...
are not gonna do
anything about it.
I'll make my own decisions.
Better hurry. I got a date.
Well, hurry.
Make your own decisions.
Here, wipe your nose.
Hello, Frank. She here
yet? No, Mr. Thompson.
You sure?
Oh, positive.
I'll wait down here
at the bar for her.
Well, now, here's a girl you can
always find when you want her.
I don't think
I quite like that.
The innuendo.
I think I resent it.
Bad taste.
I beg your pardon.
But he won't need the table
tonight. Why keep it for him?
I realize that, but I don't
know how to tell him about it.
It's simple.Just say
I had to take the liberty.
Say I had to
give the table away.
But you don't understand.
He only just came in.
He don't know yet. Nobody's
told him. Then tell him.
Tell him.
I should tell him?
What do you want me to do? Get stuck
with an empty table on my hands all night?
Tell him
I took the liberty.
The average fellow, just because
a girl takes a drink now and then,
right away he jumps to conclusions,
won't treat her with respect.
Well, I treat everybody
with respect. I have to.
I'm on the public payrolls,
remember? I'm a checker.
Aw, get lost.
I didn't order this, Frank.
On the house, Mr. Thompson.
Well,
what's the occasion?
Have one with me.
You?
I thought you fellas knew all about this
stuff and never touched it. What's happened?
Oh, nothin', nothin'.
Only, you see, I'm in
sort of a spot. Yeah?
Well, I guess it's up to me
to break the bad news.
You see, the headwaiter, well,
he went ahead and gave your table away.
Wait a minute! I want it!
I'm waitin' for her.
Where is that headwaiter? That's
just the point, Mr. Thompson.
I don't think she's going
to be here tonight.
That's why he took
the liberty.
You see, she went to Yuma.
But you got it all balled up.
I'm meetin' her here.
I got a date!
I know it's something of a shock.
I could hardly believe it either, but...
she really did go to Yuma, Mr. Thompson.
You see--
Well... she got married.
I think what it must be,
nowadays a girl'll marry
anybody that asks them.
Imagine.!
A man like Slim Dundee.
A man with
his known character.
I'm sorry about that
table, Mr. Thompson, but--
He kept on talkin',
jabberin'away.
I didn't hear a word of it.
I couldn't think.
So she went to Yuma.
So she married Slim Dundee.
Of course. He had all the dough,
and that's all she ever wanted.
I told myself,
''Fine. It was a lucky break. ''
Probably the best thing
that ever happened to me.
I told myself that someday
I'd look back and realize it.
But I was wrong. It was in the cards,
and there was no way of stopping it.
A month went by,
a second, a fourth.
It was all finished.
Done with. Water over the dam.
Only it wasn't.
You know how it is. You don't
know what to do with yourself.
You want to travel,
get away, anywhere.
Every place you go,
you see her face.
Half the girls you pass are her.
Did it ever happen to you?
If I hadn't been hangin'around
the Union Station that day,
if the clerk at the newsstand hadn't picked
that moment to run out of cigarettes--
to reach down
for a fresh pack--
I just saw you leavin'.
You did? You got on
the train. I saw you.
You and him both. I just
saw him off, that was all.
Oh.
Well, I can't stay.
Why not?
Vincent'll see us together.
Vincent?
Yeah, he's driving me home.
Might get the wrong idea,
huh? That's right, he would.
He leave Vincent to keep an eye
on you while he was outta town?
If you wanna put it that
way. Shame I can't stay.
What a shame.
There he is. Don't turn.
Don't let him see you.
You don't have to worry.
He won't see me.
Thanks a lot.
Good-bye.
Here I am, Vincent.
I can't take ya home.
You can't? They gotta drive the
car up there, meet him at Las Vegas.
I thought ya knew that,
didn't ya?
Yes, I did, but it can wait, can't
it? He wants the car up there.
He wants it fast.
You know how he is.
Yes, I know.
You can take a cab.
All right. There's a bunch
of them right over there.
All right, Vincent.
I'll take a cab. Okay.
You smoke a lot, don't you?
You pass the time.
You happy?
Oh, I love it.
He gives you everything?
Diamonds.
- You want me to go?
- Go. Don't go.
Anything you like.
I didn't think he was the kind
that married people.
Oh, he did. He did.
I take my hat
off to ya.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a prize.
- Tramp.
- Tell me all about it.
Tramp.
Cheap, little no-good tramp!
Stick around.
You make it all so nice and sad.
Why did you do it? You
told me why. Diamonds.
Why? Why did you do it?
You.
Me?
Your mother, your brother, your whole
family. And your lovely friend, Ramirez!
Pete?
You didn't know.
What did he do? Told me
to stay away from you!
He was afraid I was poison. He told me
to get out of Los Angeles and stay out.
How could he do that? He said if I didn't,
he'd run me in every time he saw me.
He said he'd frame me.
Frame you?
That's right. Send me to the
women's prison at Tehachapi.
He wanted me up there
with the rest of them,
my hair cut short,
wearing striped cotton,
digging potatoes
and working in the factories.
I don't believe you.
Ask him. Go and ask him.
He brought me down to headquarters.
Sent two men in plain clothes.
Why didn't you
come to me?
Because I was sick and tired of
running after you all the time.
Begging you. ''Please, Steve! Please,
please, don't get sore, Steve.''
Because I was sick of you, your mother
and your wonderful friend, Ramirez.
Because every day you were away,
Slim was after me.
You didn't know that, did you?
Slim always wanted me.
Always wanted to give me everything.
And I got sick and tired of being a fool!
I got fed up and didn't care!
Oh, Steve!
What happened?
How did it happen?
How did I get all mixed up?
I didn't know, Anna.
I didn't know.
I'm scared.
They'd kill us.
Kill us!
I can't even sleep.
Look, the way he treats me.
Anna--
Oh, Steve!
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
What do ya say,
Mr. Thompson?
I'm perfectly all right, Frank.
Nothing for you to worry about.
You know, you came in
9:00, 1 0:00.
You been sittin' there
stewin' all by yourself.
You been beltin' that stuff
into you since 9:00, 1 0:00.
That's not good, Mr. Thompson.
That's not like you.
Mr. Thompson, don't you
think you've had enough?
Don't you think you're
outta line? Yeah, I guess so.
Don't you think you oughta mind your
own business? I'm sorry. My error.
All right.
Bighearted joker!
Too many bighearted jokers
around here.
Bad day at the races?
How did you guess? No
kidding. Did I hit it right?
Right on the head. I can
size a person up like that.
You know everything too.
Is that it?
I didn't quite say that.
See, everybody's got their own
individual problem. I can always spot it.
You people got a gift. Well,
I call it intuition, rather.
Size Frank up for me. Hey, what
is this, anyway, an inquisition?
Go ahead. You're a
sizer-upper. Size him up for me.
What's his problem?
Fallen arches. Say, what
are you getting at anyway?
You got nothin' to worry about.
You know everything.
- I didn't say that.
- You people got intuition.
Look, mister, I'm sorry
you lost at the races.
I know what it's like myself, but you
shouldn't bet if you can't afford to lose!
I'll bet anything I like.
Gosh, what have I said now?
And I'll bet
anytime I like.
Say, what do you think
you're doin'?
Nothing. Nothing. Slow down, Mr.
Thompson. This isn't like you at all.
It's about time somebody did
something about you nosy jokers.
Please don't make a commotion. It's
all right, Frank. I'll handle it.
Well, the lieutenant.
I had to phone him, Mr. Thompson.
That's perfectly all right.
You needed a pal, the way
you were beltin' it in.
That's all right.
It's all right.
We're always glad
to see the lieutenant.
Matter of fact, I got a question
I want to ask the lieutenant.
Come on, Steve.
Did you see Anna?
This is no time-- Did you
go and have a little talk?
Not now. Let's go. No.
I wanna know. Is it true?
Steve, how it happened.
Your mother--
Never mind my mother. Did you
tell Anna to get outta town?
Did you say you'd
send her to Tehachapi?
Yes, I did.
I said it. It's true.
Was that nice, tryin' to throw a
scare into a girl, tryin' to bluff her?
I wasn't bluffing.
I meant it.
Oh, you meant it.
Well, now, that's fine,
Lieutenant. Sincere.
I wanna thank the lieutenant.
Come on, Steve.
I'll take you home now.
You'll take me no place.
You done me enough favors.
Frank, tell 'em
the show's over.
Come on, boys. You heard what the
lieutenant said. Come on. Get back.
You saw her.
You're going
to keep on seeing her.
- I told you to stay out of it.
- I tell ya, I'm not wrong.
I tell ya, I know it
when I see a bad one.
Do I have to sock ya again?
Okay, let it go.
- But leave that girl alone.
- You're gonna try to stop me?
He'll stop you.
Don't you see that?
Dundee. He'll get you.
He'll throw a knife into you.
I can handle him.
Get away from me.
You don't use your head. You
don't know what I'm talkin' about.
You don't hear me.
Hear me, Steve.
I hear ya! I'm not drunk,
I'm sober. Cold sober!
I'm gonna see Anna.
I'm gonna see her
anytime that I want.
I'm gonna do anything
I please,
and you and Dundee and nobody
else is gonna tell me what to do.
See?
Steve!
Steve!
Anna. What is it?
You gotta hide. You gotta
do something quick, today.
What happened? He's on his way
back. He's gonna go looking for you.
How do you know? He
found out. He must've.
The crazy chances we took
being seen together.
Steve, we were crazy.
When is he coming back?
I don't know. Tonight.
Tomorrow. You gotta hurry!
I'm not leavin' ya.
Oh, Steve, please.
Look, there's one thing sure.
You're not staying with him.
Oh, forget about me.
I don't care what happens to me.
I'll go to him.
I'll tell him.
Tell him what?
To let you go.
What's the matter with you?
Don't you think I've talked
to him a hundred times?
You don't know him
the way I do.
You don't know the people
he's got around him.
He'll kill you. He's got ways.
The minute he sees you--
Stop it! We'll work it out.
We'll-- We'll go away together.
Where? How?
Where can we go?
We've got no money. Don't you
understand? We haven't got a cent!
He'll always find us.
Look.
What?
You go up to the house
at Palos Verdes. What for?
Stay there. Wait for me. I'll
clear it up here. You can't!
I'll find a way.
I've got to.
What was that?
Refrigerator door.
Refrigerator?
Why don't you come down
and join us?
You don't mind it, do ya?
Our helping ourselves, I mean.
Hello, baby.
You know, uh,
it don't look right.
You can't exactly say
it looks right now, can you?
I asked her to come here. I wanted
to reach you. I wanted to talk to you.
Oh. So it was me
all the time.
Between you and I,
I had it all wrong.
So it's not the way
it looks, is it, baby?
- No, it's not the way it looks.
- That's right, Slim.
Just like he says.
He wanted to talk to you.
You were out of town,
so I said I'd come over.
You really wanted
to see me?
Tell me now, Stevie,
what kind of business could you
and I possibly have together?
Ajob.
Ajob?
Well, why come to me?
'Cause you're
the only crooks I know.
Is that polite?
Is it hospitable?
Tell me, Stevie. What kind of
a job is this you need crooks?
- Where I work.
- Where you work?
Armored trucks.
What are ya talkin' about? You
can't hijack an armored truck!
It can't be done.
You know it can't be done.
It can be done.
How?
If you have
an inside man.
Picturesque, ain't it?
Down the hall
to the right. 1 1 3.
What are we meeting here for?
Who lives here?
Finchley.
Finchley? Gee whiz,
I thought he was dead.
But why do we all
have to go to him?
When they're the top men
in their line, you go to them.
Hello, Finchley.
I'm glad to see ya.
I mean it.
I thought you was dead.
Finchley,
they're all waiting.
A lunatic idea.
I told you.
Won't go near it.
Wouldn't be bothered.
Finchley, there's a month's credit for
you at Conrad's Liquor Store on Hill St.
I'm going out this evening.
A previous engagement.
We can't go ahead without
you. You're top man!
Relax. It'll take
just a minute.
He'll come around.
You don't like the whole thing, call
it off!. I'm not taking any short count.
I figured it all out. It's a two-way
split. One for you, one for me.
Cut your half any way
you like. In a pig's eye.
Can you work it without
me? You know I can't.
Let's get this straight
before we start.
This is the way I want it:
50-50.
That boy is no fool.
He's got cards in spades.
Don't worry. There'll be
plenty left for all of you.
Slim, he's right.
Okay. You're the boss
man. Any way you want it.
Where's Finchley? Why don't you
go see what's holdin' him up?
Just a minute, Slim. You know
Finch. You can't rush him.
Slim, why do I have to stay here?
Why don't I go to a movie?
What do you wanna go to a movie
for? Don't you wanna stick around?
Doesn't this interest ya?
Sit down.
Come on.
Hurry him up.
Here he comes.
Walt talked him into it.
Just dropped by to tell you
you're wasting your time.
We know all that, Finchley.
Come on. Let's go to work.
Believe me, I know more about the
armored truck business than you do.
You'd be surprised.
I work for them.
Indeed. Indeed.
Now, that certainly makes an
interesting problem, doesn't it?
You think you can lay it out
for us, Finchley?
What have you in mind?
The Bliss Company payroll.
At San Rafelo?
That's right.
Very interesting.
Eh!
Delightful.
Delightful.
What's so interesting about it?
You're on the coast
at San Rafelo.
There's only one highway available to you
until you pass the bridge.
Don't you see how that
complicates your getaway?
I don't think that's so wonderful;
I think it's rotten.
Give me the road map.
Hmm, that'll take
some doing.
I suggest that you send out for
sandwiches, or what you will.
It is definitely settled, the
arrangement down at Conrad's? Hmm?
Paid for. All been paid for. Thank you.
Take these cigarette butts off the
table. Can't stand the stink of'em.
How long's your run?
Forty minutes.
What time do you leave? 9:30
in the morning, on the dot.
Mm-hmm.
Who's your chemical man?
Hey.!
What's your experience?
I know my stuff.
Can you get what's needed?
I can put my hands on it.
You sure? He makes it!
He's a registered druggist.
Was.
What's that? I can't
read it. S-I-C-L-4.
I thought you said
you knew your business.
Thompson, you're lookin'
for something?
Ran out of cigarettes.
Here. Take my pack.
Thanks.
Who's your getaway man?
I got a Ferrari motor in my job.
I can take anything out.
I wouldn't handle
the money that way.
Mine's the fastest heap
there is. I can do 1 1 4.
No, I'd use the slowest
vehicle to take the money out.
The very slowest. Something
that nobody would suspect.
- An ice cream wagon, say.
- Hmm, that's a new wrinkle.
An ice cream wagon.
How can it miss?
Here. Take a drink.
You deserve it.
When I'm finished.
In the Roubel Ice Factory
holdup years ago,
they knocked off an armored
truck for 427,950 dollars.
But the cops caught 'em,
every one.
They're all dead now.
Electric chair, everything.
Yeah, I realize.
But 400 grand!
Where's Anna? Just stepped
outside for a paper.
You're gonna need
a cover story.
Why do we need a cover
story? For the getaway.
I told you, that's the ticklish
part, the most intricate.
That's where you'll need the
oil truck. A big one? What for?
To stall at the proper time
and block the bridge.
Oh,jam the truck sideways,
right across the road.
That'll give your people a bit
of a head start for the getaway.
Trouble is, there's radio nowadays.
Two-way radio.
Now, what are you going to tell 'em
if they find you up ahead, hmm?
What's your story? I'm
takin' a trip... to Detroit.
Up along the coast, by
way of San Francisco. Good.
But really go there.
Advertise it.
Let the cops downtown put it on their
Teletype so that everybody knows.
We'll pass the word around and then
give a big party the night before.
Good. Good.
Do you understand?
Steve, Steve.
Understand? You're
going to Palos Verdes.
I wanna cry.
I wanna cry.
Go up to the house
and wait for me.
I wish
we'd never met.
It's done and settled.
It's the only way.
I wish you'd
never seen me.
You'll stay there.
You'll wait for me.
It'll take time to get away.
They'll hold me, ask me questions.
But stay there,
and don't worry.
You gotta hand it
to the old man.
Now, is the new bridge
up there all finished?
Who checked the highways?
What about the detours?
There you are.
There you have it.
The way I understand it, there'll
be no shooting. No shooting whatever.
No matter how it goes, I don't want nothin'
to happen to the old man that's with me.
Is that understood?
You're the boss man.
Anything else
you'd like, boss?
Yes. Who handles
the payoff?
What's the matter? You worried
because I'll be in Detroit?
Don't tell me
you don't trust me.
That hurt your feelings? No.
Anything you like. Who do you want?
Him? Him? Pick anyone. I don't care.
What about her?
I don't know
any of the boys.
Okay, let it be her.
Is that okay with you?
Yeah. I can handle Anna.
When you get that ice cream wagon
back to town, give the money to her.
It's a deal, then. It's
all set. It's all set.
That's the ticket.
That's the ticket. Cheers.
This is it now.
The payoff.
Nothing will stop it.
Another five minutes
and we'll cross the bridge.
Another five minutes to San Rafelo,
to Vincent and the ice cream wagon,
to the rest of them.
Another five minutes to go.
Steve, there's a car tailin' us.
It's your imagination.
No. Big black car.
Swung out as we passed.
Lots of black cars
on the road.
Let her out, Steve.
What for?
Open 'er up. Let's see
if they stay with us.
All right.
I don't know what's the matter
with me. Getting jittery.
Sure.
Take it easy, Pop.
I'll be glad
when this run's over.
Another four minutes.
There they go:
Walt, Mort, Midget.
1 0:1 4. 1 0:1 4.
The oil truck.
On the nose.
Perfect timing.
Here, son.
Here I am, Steve.
He's coming out of it,
Doctor.
He'll be kind of rocky
for a while, Mrs. Thompson.
Why don't you all
come back in the morning?
He'll feel more
like seeing you then.
You're a mighty lucky fellow,
Thompson. You know that?
How's Pop?
You're all right, Steve.
Don't worry about your arm.
The doctor says it's going to
be fine, just as good as new.
Holy smokes, Steve. If you
only saw the newspapers.
How's Pop?
Not now, Steve.
You did your best. You can't
blame yourself. We're proud of you.
Pop's dead.
What more could you have done? You fought
them off, you saved half the payroll.
Look.
It's in the papers.
''Quarter million
armored car holdup.''
And here's your picture.
You're a hero.
''Steve Thompson, now in
the Angel Of Mercy Hospital,
saves half of payroll,
foils perfect crime.''
Doctor? He'll be all
right. Hejust fainted.
Why don't you all come back
in the morning?
Hello, Pete.
Lieutenant, Steve.
Lieutenant.
You were in with them.
You were part of it.
Is that why you came up here?
To pull me in? Book me?
They don't hijack armored
trucks, Steve. It can't be done.
They know it can't be done,
not unless they've got an angle.
You were that angle.
What do you want me to do,
give myself up?
Confess?
Put up my other hand?
They used you.
They took you.
Who did?
Slim, Anna.
Oh.
You worked for
the armored trucks.
They had to have an inside man.
You were it.
You were the inside man.
You've got it all figured out,
haven't you?
Yeah, I figured it out.
Go ahead.
Keep talkin'.
You still haven't said anything.
You're no crook, Steve.
You weren't born
for a holdup.
I don't get it. How did they
ever get you in on this deal?
What did she do,
make you promises?
Were you gonna
run away together?
What kind of a stunt
did they pull on you?
Did they get you into a tight corner
where there was no other way out?
Tell the truth, Steve.
Didn't they work you for
the prize sucker of all time?
Shut up.
You don't know what
you're talkin'about.
Get your stupid cop's face
outta here.
You don't believe me.
You think I'm wrong.
I'll tell you something
that might interest you.
Slim isn't dead. You didn't
kill him. He got away.
What about it?
So he's alive.
What are you driving at?
Just this, chump:
If she double-crossed you, if she's
with Slim now, then you're all right.
A smashed shoulder,
a crippled arm,
forty bucks a month pension,
a thousand-dollar bonus.
But if she's on the level with you,
if she double-crossed Slim,
if she's really waiting for you
somewhere, then he'll get you.
Never forget that.
You see that door?
He'll send a gunman for you
right through that door.
And he'll get you.!
Get out!
You got nothin' on me.
You can't prove a thing.
So you still think I'm wrong, huh?
What do you want me to do, put a pair
of police guards outside the door?
She's with Slim.
Get out!
I should've been
a better friend.
I should've stopped you.
I should've grabbed you by the neck;
I should've kicked your teeth in.
I'm sorry, Steve.
I'm sorry.
Well, here we are,
Mr. Thompson.
How are you comin' along? Going to go
dancing with your arm up in the air like that?
Eh, you're my last customer.
I'll get you settled down for
the night, and then I'm off duty.
Butjust think.
Isn't it terrible?
I have to go all the way
out to Monrovia,:
a barbecue at my friend's
house in Monrovia.
Say,you don't know
how lucky you really are.
Nurse. Nurse, would you
do something for me?
Would you raise my bed? Oh, Mr.
Thompson, that's not the idea at all.
You don't want to move that
arm. Lift me up. Please.
Well, all right,
seeing that you're a hero.
Can't refuse a hero.
And up we go.
Now how's that? High
enough? That's fine. Thanks.
Now, then, you've got to do
something for me in return.
I brought you some pills and I want you to
take them. They'll let you sleep tonight.
Just a minute.
Who's that man
out in the hall?
What's he doing here?
Who?
Oh. Oh, a visitor.
Just a visitor.
Poor man! He's taking it
so hard. He's so devoted.
He's been sitting there for hours. His
wife, she was hurt in an automobile accident.
He hasn't left her
for a minute.
He's from Bakersfield.
His name is Nelson.
W-Would you ask him to come
in here? I want to talk to him.
Well, uh--
All right.
Mr. Nelson. Uh, Mr. Nelson!
Will you come here a minute?
I hear your wife was
in an accident. What?
Oh, yes. I'll never forget
it as long as I live.
I'll never forgive myself.
You see, I was doing
the driving at the time.
It had to be her, only her!
It couldn't be me!
I didn't even get a scratch.
I'm sick about it. Mr. Nelson,
you mustn't reproach yourself.
That's foolish. And your wife's
going to be perfectly all right.
Do you know who he is?
Did you see
the evening papers?
Look.
Steve Thompson.
He's famous.
We often get famous
patients. Oh, is that so?
That's certainly nice,
ain't it?
Now, then,
here's your nightcap.
Drink it up and you'll get a
good night's sleep. Not now.
It's just the pills.
Later. Leave it there.
I'll drink it later.
Oh, all right.
I've got to hurry.
Monrovia. Barbecue.
Now, if you want anything,
just press the buzzer.
And don't forget to take
your pills, hmm? Good night.
Good night, Mr. Nelson.
Good night.
Can I get you anything?
That table is a little
out of reach, isn't it?
What have you got there?
Here?
My-- My order book.
My sales route.
You see, I'm from Bakersfield.
I got a wholesale
hardware business.
What's the matter?
Nothing. I'm just a little nervous.
You understand.
Forget it.
Oh, sure.
I can realize.
Well, I guess I'd better
be gettin' back to my wife.
No, don't!
Don't go.
Mr. Nelson, could I--
Could I ask you--
Would you do something
for me? A big favor?
Sure.
Anything you want.
Close that door.
The door?
Yeah.
Yes? Would you stay here with me?
Would you sit in that chair
and watch the door?
If anyone comes,
don't let 'em in.
If you hear anyone coming, would
you wake me up? Would you do that?
Well... I don't think
I exactly know--
I'd be very grateful
if you'd do that.
I want somebody to stay with me.
Would you do that for me, please?
Would you?
Of course.
Certainly.
Thanks.
Thompson.
Thompson?
Come on, Thompson.
I waited.
I got your clothes.
You're comin' with me.
- Where?
- Slim wants to see you.
Wants to find out where the
money is, where Anna is. Come on.
You can't get me out of here.
You can't do a thing to me.
Not a thing.
Hey.
You're driving me
to Slim?
Do you hear me?
What's he paying you?
Two hundred? Five?
Take me where I want to go and
I'll give you 1 0,000. Ten grand.
Are you listenin'?
What are you afraid of?
What difference does it make who pays you?
What can go wrong?
Can I cross you?
How can I cross you?
You worried about Slim?
Don't be a sap.
He's a dead man. Cops are
after him. Do you hear me?
This is a big chance
for you.
Ten grand. It's a lot
of dough, but I got it.
You know I got it.
Come on. Be smart.
Take me where I want to go.
Ten grand.
Ten grand.
Anna, you're here.
I knew it.
I knew all the time
everything would be all right.
Who is he, Steve?
Give him ten thousand.
Pay him off.
Pay him, Anna,
and let's get rid ofhim.
Don't shut the door.
Keep the door open.
Here's your money.
Thanks.
I didn't know
what to think.
They got their hands on the
money, then they started shootin'.
Suddenly out of nowhere, the whole
crazy thing blew up in my face.
I knew they'd double-cross me,
Slim and the rest of them.
But I didn't care, Anna. It meant
nothing so long as I could count on you.
Pete said you were part of it, that you
were in on it with Slim from the start.
That dumb cop.
He had it all figured out.
Who was that man, Steve? Who?
That man.
How did you get away?
Tell me!
Who was that man?
Oh, he came to the hospital.
Slim sent him.
Slim?
It's all right. He's got his
money. We're through with him.
You think we're through.
Don't you see?
Don't you know what's gonna happen?
He's on his way back to Slim.
He'll tell Slim where I am
right this minute.
Don't worry about Slim.
I talked to Pete.
The cops'll pick him up
the minute he shows his face.
I have to get away. You don't know
what you've done bringing him here.
I have to pack.
I have to hurry.
You're going away?
You're gonna leave me? Here?
How far could I get with you?
What kind of a chance
would we have?
You can't move.
You couldn't last a day.!
Don't you understand? You need help,
doctors. You could never make it.
What do you want me to do?
Let him get us both?
Would that make you feel happier?
Does that make sense to you?
No. Not anymore.
Why did you have to come here
in the first place? Why? Why?
It was all working out.
Everything was fine.
Papers said you'd be
in the hospital for weeks!
All those things
you said to me--
You weren't lying.
I know you meant it.
You love me.
Love, love! You have to
watch out for yourself.
That's the way it is. What do you want
me to do, throw away all this money?
You always have to do
what's best for yourself.
That's the trouble with you.
It always was, from the beginning.
You just don't know
what kind of a world it is.
Well, I'll know better next time.
People get hurt!
I can't help it!
I can't help it if people don't know
how to take care of themselves.
I'm sorry I can't be like you.
I'm not like you.
I wasn't born that way.
Yes,you're right.
I am different.
I never wanted the money.
I just wanted you.
After we split up, I used to walk the
streets in strange cities at night.
I used to think about you.
I just wanted to hold you in my arms,
to take care of you.
It could've been wonderful,
but it didn't work out.
What a pity it didn't work out.
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.
I'm sorry.
Steve.! Steve.!
I figured you'd bribe Nelson
to take you to Anna.
You always wanted her,
didn't you, Thompson?
You really loved her.
You know, I did too.
But you won out, Thompson.
You've got her.
She's all yours now.
Steve!
Hold her.
Hold her tight.
Steve!
Anna.
