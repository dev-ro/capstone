What's up?
You've ruined my dream!
What a dream!
I was dancing and singing
and swaying away...
and the world was
swaying with me.
I'm not going to
forgive you for this!
Oh indeed. As if...
- Where's my file?
It's there on the table!
And where is the table?
Under that heap of files.
- Found it!
*Enjoy yourself, O drunkard...*
Not you too!
- Well?
Who else has been bothering my wife?
- Look at the princess's airs!
She's late for work. And she says
I've ruined her dream!
That's not right, Mili.
She ruined your dream
while you slept.
And she ruined my dreams
while I still live!
Have I ever complained?
- As if you'd be a big shot!
Listen, darling...
- Yes?
I had always dreamed, that:
*I'd never be a somebody*
*What have we to be...?*
Aren't you going for your bath?
*- Why must we bathe...?*
What are you doing...?
Have you gone mad?
Stop it!
You must be happy that your daughter
even dreams of what she wants to be.
All right. But dreams are fulfilled
only when man rises from his slumber.
But you dream only when you
go to sleep, understand?
What is it?
What are you doing?
- I'm studying.
Are you really studying?
Or are you asleep?
He's studying... he isn't dreaming.
Here I go...
My word, Motilal! You've taken to
your books so early in the day!
I don't intend to spend 3 years
in Class 10 like you.
My little brother...
I wasn't killing time in Class 10.
I was learning to dance.
Because I'm not going to be
a clerk after those studies.
I want to become an actress.
Sister...
- Well?
Could you give me an autograph?
How about a kick...?
Will that do?
Mili! Aren't you leaving?
- I'll fix you, all right.
The camera isn't rolling.
Whether the camera's
rolling or not...
I'm a director whose mind
is always at work.
I'm not competing with
the directors here.
I'm competing with Hollywood.
So let me see the frame.
It's so very dark...
I can't see anything.
Dark...? It must be
because of this cap.
As I said, "Hum Aapke Hain Koun"
is said to be a hit movie.
It has broken all records.
All that is okay. But do you
know the inside story?
No, I don't.
It was my script.
- Yours?!
I was supposed to produce
the film originally.
And all those sequences are
actually part of my marriage!
Really?
- But I said it's okay...
Suraj is my own boy.
Let him direct the film.
And everyone praises the film today.
It's Suraj who is walking
away with all the credit...
but it was my story, after all!
Gulbadan hasn't yet
reported for shooting.
It's a 9 'O clock shift.
And she isn't here at 12!
She's going to make
beggars out of my kids!
I don't think I will
ever see this film.
Don't stand there and grin.
Go and call her!
Here she is...
so very punctual!
Welcome, madam.
Get a chair for mummy!
Set it here.
- Of course, madam.
Do you know the story before
the song sequence?
My baby doesn't know anything.
Our heroine is in the village.
Out there, the cold breeze...
Would you like a cold drink, dear?
- Sure.
Could you send for
some fruit juice?
Get a glass of fruit-juice.
- Two glasses.
As I said, there's a cool breeze
blowing in the village...
I'd like a milk shake
with custard apple... okay?
A milk shake with custard apple.
- Make it two.
Yes. Go on.
- With lots of ice.
This isn't a season for custard apple.
- Get it from somewhere!
It's available only in November.
- So get it in November!
I've been explaining a sequence!
You're screaming!
You have scared my little girl!
Send for the fan...
- Get the fan!
Is this dress okay?
Let's shoot the song first.
I'll narrate the story later.
The shot is ready.
Tickets worth 10 going
for 30...
Want one?
Tickets worth 10
going for 30...
How much?
- 30 Rupees.
Two tickets for me.
- So cough it up.
What?
- 60 bucks.
They're corner seats, I hope?
- Of course. At opposite ends.
Give me some tickets, Munna.
Mine are finished.
How are you doing?
- Great.
I come on foot and hail
a cab to go back home.
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...
Do you have any tickets?
- Want an advance booking?
You're kidding.
How much is it going for?
Didn't you hear that?
For 30 Rupees.
Could I have it for 15 Rupees?
- You get to watch half the film.
Oh damn it...
- Come back here.
I like your face.
Go and watch the film.
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...
Come here.
- What is it?
Come here!
- Me...?
You've been selling tickets
in the black-market?
Me? Do I look like
a black-marketer?
What was that about 30 Rupees then?
- I was looking for tickets myself.
I'd happily pay 30 bucks for a ticket.
But there's no one around.
Do you think I'm a fool?
Raise your hand!
Stop kidding sir...
how'd I raise my hand at you?
Raise your hands... go on!
- Hey! You're bullying me!
Look at this, folks!
They let those who instigate
riots, go scot-free.
There was a scandal involving
billions in the stock market.
Did they arrest anyone?
No.
But they will harass a poor guy
like me who wants to watch a film.
Go ahead...
Did you find something?
No?
You have humiliated me
publicly, haven't you?
What's going to happen
to this country...?
Get lost, fellows!
This ain't no drama!
What sleight of hand!
Hey black egg... get lost.
- Scram!
Where's the rest of the gang?
- They've left.
Let's make ourselves scarce...
things are heating up here.
What happened?
What kind of a director are you
to make her do such a dance?
Aren't you ashamed to give her
such difficult steps?
This director is a fool!
He watches MTv and gets us
to do weird steps...
Does anyone ask an actress
to do such difficult steps?
What if something had
happened to my girl?
Don't get excited, mummy.
I'll handle it...
Does it hurt?
- Don't worry...
I'll have the steps changed.
- Like hell you will!
You should've known better than
ask her to do such steps!
You aren't hurt badly...
- Shut up! How isn't it bad?
What do you know?
You don't become a director
by merely wearing a viewfinder.
The poor baby has
sprained her ankle...
It's pack-up for the day...
Pack up!
Hear me out, mummy, please...!
- Didn't you hear me? Pack up!
Come, dear... let's go.
Please, mummy!
I'll have it changed!
I can't figure out of if we have
signed the girl or her mother!
Why do the girls' mothers
ever attend a shoot?!
I'm going to quit this place and
head straight for Hollywood!
What the hell! I'll go bust,
if you go to Hollywood!
I don't care what happens to you!
That old hag...
Calm down, please. I'll somehow make
them see reason and bring them...
Why are you getting worked up?
Sorry, Kamalji.
It's pack up.
Would Julia Roberts' mother ever treat
Spielberg like I've been treated?
Kamalji's leaving.
- What else will he do?
He's such a fine actor.
But the lady always finds
some excuse to throw a fuss.
I think she's just not
interested in her work.
Why must we bother?
We're getting paid.
How can you say such things?
We come here so we can learn
something and become good actors.
It isn't that we just
come here, dance and leave.
Sorry, lady. I have no ambitions.
I'm happy where I am.
Go ahead if you want
to make it big.
How're you doing?
- Fine.
Switch on that fan.
Get us some tea.
Quick.
Read that sign. You pay cash.
If I had the money, wouldn't
I go to a five-star?
I'll settle your account tomorrow.
- Sure?
Of course. Whom else have I paid?
Go on. And get me
some cookies.
Did you get those tickets, Munna?
What're you screaming for?
- Mili! Come here!
Why are you screaming?
- Sit down. Have a soft drink.
No. I'm going home.
Sit for a while. I'll join you.
Get a cold drink for her.
Prakash! You're smoking again?
- I'm kicking the habit tomorrow.
So... how's the shoot going?
Don't even ask me.
The lead-lady made us work so
hard on a simple step today...
that we had it coming out
of our ears.
I've been telling you
to give it up.
You're going to wear out
your shoes in those shoots.
You start lecturing me now...?
- It's true.
I've seen life there on the footpaths.
- Try and think of something better.
You're wasting your time
like a worthless loafer.
Find some job in a nice company.
- To hell with jobs!
Rather than play a rich man's dog,
I'll enjoy my life out on the streets.
I'll be my own boss...
Right, Pakya?
Right!
You're never going to change.
- Where are you going, Mili!

Kamal was fed up of the
lady's tantrums and left...
What ice cream will you eat?
Vanilla, raspberry, pineapple...?
I don't want an ice cream.
- I'm buying it for you.
Have some.
- I don't want it. Let's go.
Strange! I'm treating you to some
Ice cream, and you don't want it!
So what am I to do?
I didn't like that, Mili.
- What?
I felt like buying you an ice cream.
And you refused it!
Oh come on, Munna. You take
offense for every little thing.
I didn't want an ice-cream
and so I refused it.
I only asked you to have an ice cream!
- There you go again...
Did I say something wrong?
- What's right and what's wrong...?
You start a fight everywhere...
- What are you doing?
One banana. What loss is it to you?
- Pay up quietly!
What will you do if I don't?
Want a bloody punch?
One moment... how much is it?
- You're not going to pay, Mili!
Will you take it away for free?
- You're asking for it!
I've already paid you, so keep quiet.
...c'mon, Munna... c'mon!
You don't know me, punk!
I'm famous around here!
Mess with me and you'd never be
able to sell bananas here again!
What the hell was that, Munna?
- You shouldn't have paid him!
Won't he ask you for money
when you pick up a banana?
It's not about money!
Can't I pay him?
But you didn't pay him.
- He acted as if I'd stolen a fortune!
It was you who started it, Munna.
- But he started the fight!
All right! You're not at fault.
Nor is he. I'm the one to blame!
So why fight with me
if it was your mistake?
What are you doing all alone, Motilal?
- Mili won't play with me.
Not she... go ahead and bat.
I'll bowl an over.
Mom!
- Here I am.
Munna's going to drive me mad someday.
- Why? Did he get into a fight today?
It wasn't just a fight.
It was a scene!
What happened?
- We were walking together...
and there was this banana-seller.
Munna picked up a banana.
know what Munna said when the
poor man asked for his money?
What?
- "What loss will one banana make?"
You're laughing! And I know what I've
been through out there on the streets.
Munna is mischievous, I know.
But he's good-hearted.
Most orphans go berserk
without their parents.
But not him. He's a nice boy.
- Nice, my foot!
Where the hell is it?
For a boy as little as you are,
you play shots like Tendulkar.
know what?
- What?
Anyone can score sixers
off your bowling.
Really?! Let me see.
Score a sixer...
You've had it, my boy!
You're going to get a thrashing!
What's happening out here?
Motilal... who
smashed the pane?
It was Munna.
- What?
Who was batting?
You? Or me?
I'm sure Munna's responsible
for all this, Mom.
Is he innocent only because
he's your brother?
Yes, he's my brother...
so what are you going to do?
Quiet, Mili.
Tell me the truth, Motilal.
Who broke the pane?
Munna did.
- You're lying!
Weren't you the one who was batting?
- But you said you'd score a sixer.
When did I say that?
- You said it, of course!
Will you bully me because
I'm a kid?
A kid, eh...?
You're acting smart with me!
He's blaming me!
- It's all over, okay?
The story's over!
- What's over?
Go and take a look at the kitchen.
- So?
Whoever has done it
will clean the mess.
That's exactly what we don't know.
Who did it?
Munna has done it, I say!
- You're lying again!
Don't you touch me!
- No? I'll give you a slap!
I know you well, fatso.
Go on and clean the mess.
But...
- No arguments... go on.
Very well...
I'll fix you later.
Go ahead and laugh. You're always
waiting for a chance to laugh at me.
My sweet will.
I can laugh at anything
and anyone I wish.
Really...?
- What's this between you now?
I've had enough of
their fights already.
Come on inside and freshen up.
I'll give you something to eat.
That's something!
I'm leaving...
I'm going to the movies.
Which film?
- That Raj Kamal starrer...
Mr. Bond?
- Yes.
D'you have tickets for the film?
- Sure. I have two tickets.
Wait till I get ready...
- Not you.
I'm going with a friend.
- Won't you take me then?
Why must I take you along?
Please, Munna...
I've been dying to see the film.
Will you poke fun at me again?
- No.
Will you be angry with me?
- Never.
All right. Go on and get ready.
I'll change, too.
Kamal! Congratulations!
This film of yours
is a super hit too!
There was this distributor
who called from C.P.C.I.
He said the film would
gross more than 10 million.
The distributor from Delhi
said the same thing.
The film is bit weak
in Rajasthan, no doubt.
But it will pick up
by word of mouth.
In Bengal and Punjab, it's going
to break all box-office records!
This is what I came to tell you.
Well then, I must leave now.
How about the heroine's call-sheet?
- I've spoken to her mom.
She said she would
confirm tomorrow.
My God! The movie must've begun.
- How are you?
C'mon now... we're already late.
The movie must've already begun.
It's full of songs in
the first half.
Watch the songs on Tv
if you miss them.
No way. I'm going to
watch the whole film.
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...
Munna! There's your friend. Pakya.
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...
So?
He's selling tickets
in the black-market!
He's had such a black life...
what else will he do?
What's that about his black life?
- You'd be shaken up...
if you get to know the
story of his life.
Pakya's mother died when
he was just 5 years old.
His father, the alcoholic,
kicked the bucket soon after.
Pakya had just one intention in life.
To get his only sister married.
He lived only so his
sister could be married.
But his bad luck. The suitor's parents
asked for so much of dowry...
that he has been selling tickets
in the black-market ever since.
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...
No one could know Pakya has
such a sordid story behind him.
The truth about a man is never
obvious from the way he looks.
Let's go.
Show us to our seats, buster...
has the movie started?
This cinema hall is a furnace!
Start that fan!
Will you let us
watch the film, please?
Please let us watch the film.
- Stick to your wife, old man.
Enjoying yourself, lady?
- Shut up, Munna!
You won't even let them
watch the movie in peace!
What a great shot!
- I bought it today. Readymade.
It's him I'm talking about.
Not you.
He wears a hired shirt. I've bought
mine with hard-earned money.
Right?
- Oh yes.
Take that foot off!
Watch the movie... not my foot.
Look ahead.
I've bought a ticket, too.
- So you own the theater, eh?
You're showing off
to the girl, are you?
Really? Wait till I fix you...
Get up! What did you say?
- Don't touch me!
I won't touch...
I'll kick you!
Hey Mili...
At least hear me out!
Why aren't you answering me?
I've been calling out to you...
at least answer me.
Get out of my way!
What have I done...?
Why are you so angry?
Don't talk to me, I say!
What have I done?
- What have you done?
Why did you get into a fight with him?
- Didn't you hear what he said?
I did. And I even saw what you did.
Who asked you to put your foot up?
Great! You find fault only with me!
This isn't right, okay?
I've taken enough, Mili...
Can't you live without
getting into fights?
Now tell me something, uncle.
Why do you go to the movies?
Why do you go to the movies?
For the fun of it, isn't it?
When I pay for my ticket,
won't I even sit comfortably?
Sure you will.
- Then?
That doesn't mean you will kick
the man sitting in front of you.
Now don't make up stories!
I haven't kicked anyone!
What's wrong if my foot
happened to touch him?
Nothing wrong at all.
He was having a whale of a time!
What's happened, Munna?
- Nothing, aunt!
She takes everything to the limit!
So what if I stretched my feet?
Was that guy more interested
in my foot?
Everyone goes to the movies
to enjoy them.
That doesn't mean you can
kick people around.
Tell me...
isn't that rather cheap?
Isn't it?
- Absolutely.
Talk to me!
I'll answer every accusation!
I don't want to talk to you, I said.
- See?
You decide this, uncle.
She doesn't even listen to me.
And it was such a rotten movie.
It drove me crazy.
Listen... not a word
about the movie, okay?
Why not? Because Raj Kamal,
your favorite, starred in it?
Will a rotten film be good
just because he acts in it?
You're a big shot, aren't you?
- I'm the public!
I have a right to my opinion.
If I don't get value for my money,
he's finished!
Even your favorite, Raj Kamal.
- Really?
Of course!
My finger...!
Are you hurt...?
What happened?
Let me see...
You're always bothering me!
Dad! You're laughing...?
See that?
It looks as if the stars
had descended to the earth.
With a house behind every star...
and a story behind
every household.
They all look similar
from a distance.
Munna... what are
you doing here?
I've been looking for you.
And you're dancing here all alone.
The lead-lady threw a fuss
and walked out again.
I thought I'd rehearse
for a while.
But what brings you here?
I created a scene at the
theater yesterday, didn't I?
I went home and thought
about the whole thing.
I felt very sorry.
I'm a hot-tempered guy, you know.
I flare up when provoked.
So I've brought two more tickets.
I'll show you the film today
without anymore fuss.
Oh, get lost.
Is this the set where you shoot?
The place you're so excited about?
All that blah blah...
what's go great about it?
We have better decorations during
our festivals in the streets.
Really?
*What are you looking for...?
Tell me*
*Tell me...*
*You can have anything you want*
*Such is the magic I work*
*You will have
everything you want*
*What do you want...?
Tell me*
*Take it...*
*You can have my heart
if you wish*
*What else will I wish for
except your heart...?*
*Take a look at the things
you can see from here*
*Everything belongs to you*
*What have I to do with
all these things...?*
*I belong to you;
you belong to me*
*What are you looking for...?
Tell me*
*Ask me... how I feel*
*Let me have your
heart, darling...*
*how about it?*
*Try and understand
what I'm saying*
*Come and take look
at the breath-taking view*
*Let me introduce you
to the spring*
*Forget the views
and the spring...*
*Come closer...
my heart beckons you*
*What do you want...?
Tell me*
*Take anything you wish*
*Such is the magic I weave*
*You will have anything
you wish*
I've got to say something to you.
You won't tell anyone, will you?
Of course not. What is it?
I haven't spoken about it to anyone.
You're the only one.
No sweat.
Mili...
- What has she done now?
Have you had another fight?
- Listen to me!
You start speaking even before
I've said something.
Mili...
her folks likes me a lot.
They love me so very much.
Her Mom and dad...
they're like family to me.
As for Mili...
I like her very much.
You understand what I say?
- Sure.
What?
- You like Mili. Her mom and dad too.
I... I want to marry Mili.
What? Come again, Munna!
I want to marry Mili.
- Marriage?
Munna's getting married!
Hey... forget it.
I'm serious.
And you're joking.
I'm delighted! But why're you
telling me all this?
Go and tell your bride.
I'll only be a guest!
That's the problem.
Mili doesn't take me seriously.
What if I propose to her
and she laughs at me?
Why would she laugh at you?
- You don't know how she is.
Forget all that.
You want to marry her, right?
So you'll have to propose
to her sooner or later.
You're right.
Okay, I'll propose to her.
The moment I find an opportunity.
Help!
She was scared!
You're such a crybaby, Mili.
How're you going to manage?
I'm going to scream even louder!
D'you know how scary it is?
This is nothing. In America
they have better games.
America indeed!
As if you've been there!
He has a railway pass.
He travels there everyday.
That's enough. Why do you keep
bothering her, Munna?
See? And you keep blaming me, mom!
- Enough!
Aren't we going anywhere else?
C'mon...
Where's your daddy?
Did you enjoy the ride, Mili?
Don't ask her, uncle!
- Shut up!
Remember the ride we took on
the beach before we married?
Sure. And you had run out
of breath after the ride.
That was because you were with me!
- Really?
Stop it...
not before the children.
Let's go... are we going to stay here?
- Yes. Let's fight in the car.
No. Look at that ride there.
- Are we to do only what you wish?
Quiet! Are you going
to fight even here?
Go any place you want to go.
And we'll go wherever we wish.
We'll meet at lunch.
Okay?
Talk to her!
Don't be silly...
there are people around.
This is the right time, I say!
Strike when the iron is hot!
You're crazy! This is no place
to talk about love.
This is a fair...
and we need silence.
Silence? So I'll go away.
Why must I spoil the fun?
There she is... Go on!
And pour out your heart.
Where's Pakya?
He's gone to fetch
some ice cream.
There's something I must tell you.
Actually, there's something
I've got to tell you...
Hurry up! I'm getting late!
As I said...
isn't this a great place?
Listen... there's something
I must tell you.
Yes?
As I said...
- Go on.
Actually...
that ride we took, you know?
I was scared too.
Scared, weren't you?
- Terribly scared.
Isn't that true?
I knew it!
Liar! ...c'mon!
No! Don't hit me!
Kamalji?
Who are you?
Me?
I'm Mili.
I see you everyday.
At the studio.
I'm a dancer for choreographer
Saroj Khan's troupe.
What?! Gulbadan's getting married?
Not just getting married.
She's walking out of our film too!
Walking out? Why?
- We have a lot of love scenes.
And Sudhir doesn't approve!
- Now who is Sudhir?
Her driver.
What has her driver
to do with our film?
He isn't just her driver.
He owns the car!
They're getting married.
You don't mean Gulbadan
is marrying her driver?!
Exactly. I went to meet
her Mom early this morning.
Her mom told me that since they go
from one studio to another...
they fell in love and
are going to get married.
Imagine, Dada! A film heroine
and her driver. In the car.
They romance in the car.
And they marry in the car!
Not even Spielberg
could dream of it!
To hell with Speilberg!
You're obsessed with him!
She's going to settle down
and I'm going to be ruined!
What's going to happen to me?
And to my film?
I'll be lynched by my creditors.
- Just tell me...
what I've got to do?
Take the call, Motilal.
- Haven't I anything else to do?
Yes, Mili here.
What?!
Yes, I'm free...
Okay...
Listen to this!
- Watch out...
know what? You're not
going to believe me!
What happened?
You know Raj Kamal, don't you?
- Which Raj Kamal?
The film star! Raj Kamal!
- So?
He telephoned me, Munna!
I've just spoken to him!
- Why did he call you?
Guess!
- Tell me.
Try and guess!
- Tell me... I'm no astrologer.
He wants me to play the female lead
in his next film!
He has called me over
for a screen test tomorrow!
What are you talking about?
- It's true! I swear!
This is it, Munna!
I'll deliver such a performance,
speak my lines in such a way...
I'm going to shock all of them!
Your eyes are the most important
thing in acting.
Whatever lines you speak...
they must come from your heart.
You must feel them... Okay?
Do you...?
Can you...?
Speak your lines!
Can you...?
Why must you cry?
It happens to all of us.
It happened even to me.
No, it doesn't.
I couldn't speak two lines.
I have no right to be there
in front of the camera.
It's not your mistake.
Let's cancel the shoot today.
Go home and rehearse your lines.
We'll shoot again tomorrow.
You'll do it tomorrow.
Don't worry...
Everything will be all right.
*Come back to me, my love.
I sing for you*
I'm not in!
- It's me, Munna!
Hide the bottle...
Open the door!
- One moment!
Sit down here quickly...
Hold this paper...
- What is it?
You read Rakesh's lines, okay?
- Who's Rakesh?
The hero of the film.
Read the lines after me, okay?
Let's get cracking.
What?
Are you in love with me?
My God! I hadn't ever dreamed
you'd talk to me like this.
I've never thought
like that about you.
I don't even know what
to say to you...?
Don't stare at me! Read those lines!
It's your part after mine!
Well, sure...
- One moment.
Now what do I say...
"You mean you don't love me?"
"And I thought..."
Give it to me.
- What now?
Is that the way to read...
like a parrot?
Can't you read it with some feeling?
Bloody idiot!
Nonsense! You barge into the room
and ask me to read Rakesh's lines.
Now who the hell is Rakesh?
I'm not reading anything!
All right. Don't read it!
- Of course I won't!
You don't need to do anything.
Do you know what happened there...
at the studio?
I talk so big out here.
And there... I couldn't speak
a single line when it mattered most.
Not a word.
I had forgotten everything!
I looked like a fool!
It was only because
of Mr. Raj Kamal...
that they agreed to give me
a second chance.
They want me there at 9 tomorrow.
And it's already 11.
I wanted to rehearse my lines
with someone.
So I came to you.
Who will help me,
if not you?
Why should you cry
over such a thing?
How would I know it
matters so much to you?
All right.
I'll speak those lines with you.
Once you have practiced with me,
you'll be an expert.
"Are you in love with me?
O God!"
"I've never thought of you like that"
Idiot! They're my lines.
Damn! I goofed up!
It's the other lines I speak.
Rakesh's...
Will you show me
how to say it?
"You know my sister
loves you, Rakesh"
"Do you want me to tell my sister
that you love me, and not her?"
"That you want to marry me?"
"Do you realize what she will
go through after hearing that?"
"Let alone saying such a thing to her
I can't even think of such a thing"
"My sister is a very
emotional person"
"If she even gets the feeling that
you're in love with me, not her..."
"she could even commit suicide"
"Don't let that happen, Rakesh.
Save my sister, please"
What's the time, mister?
- 5.30.
What's the time?
- 5.30.
What's the time?
- I told you. 5.30.
Why are you asking me again and again?
- So what's wrong?
I only asked you for the time.
I didn't snatch your watch.
Go ahead and read the newspaper.
Mili! Watch out...
what are you doing?
Shut your eyes!
- What happened?
Shut your eyes, I say!
- But what's up?
Shut your eyes...
Go on.
Open your eyes now.
What's this?
- Idiot! It's a check!
I'm the heroine now!
- Don't tell me!
You've got the film?
- Yes!
Didn't I tell you, Mili?
My training's gonna help you!
She's a heroine now!
Stitch a shirt and trousers
in four hours. Hurry up.
Four hours?
- Of course.
I'm giving my heroine
a party for the first time.
I must look like a hero.
Say what?
Where are you taking her?
- To a 5-star hotel.
I'm taking my heroine to a 5-star
hotel for the first ever time.
After a great Chinese meal,
I'll tell her how I feel.
It's hit or miss today.
- How will I do it in four hours?
Want me hang you up there...?
- I'll handle him. Go on.
Hurry up.
She's changing.
Paint your house again, aunt.
Your daughter's now a heroine.
Just paint the house, Munna?
We're going to get
a new bungalow now.
A great new bungalow.
Motilal, go to the tailor
and ask him to fetch my dress.
Have I nothing better to do?
- Shirker! You do nothing!
Well? Say something!
You look ravishing.
The car has arrived, sis.
- Has it?
What car?
- Mili's going to Kamal's party.
What party?
- To celebrate the success...
of his film, "Mr. Bond".
They've even sent the car.
A Maruti 1000!
Do I look okay, Mom?
My hair...?
Give Mr. Kamal my regards.
See you later!
Munna! I've got your clothes!
Here's your shirt and trousers.
Go and change!
You're gonna look great!
- Don't yell.
keep it in my room.
What's wrong? You were the one
who asked me to fetch it...
I've asked you to keep it in my room.
- Strange.
What a party!
What a glittering function.
A real showman this Raj Kamal is!
Do you call this a party?
It's rubbish!
I had launched my film.
In America.
know Bill Clinton?
He's very close friend of mine.
In his backyard,
we put up this huge set.
We broke a coconut
to launch the film...
and blew up the set with a bomb!
We shook up the Eiffel Tower!
But Eiffel Tower is in Paris,
isn't it?
Exactly!
It shook under the impact!
Hello...
Mr. Kamal's over there.
This way, please.
Hello... will you have
something to drink?
No thank you.
- Have something?
So you are Mili...
wonderful!
Do you know me?
No...?
I'm the one who has
propped up the whole industry.
Know Rekha?
- Rekha?
The film actress...?
Oh yes. Rekha...
I was the one who gave
her the name Rekha.
She's so famous.
Who...?
- Rekha.
What did I give her?
- Her name.
I was the one who gave her
the first break.
And Sridevi. When she first
arrived in Bombay from Madras...
I was the one who taught her Hindi.
What did I teach her?
Hindi.
- Whom?
Sridevi.
- Forget Sridevi.
Take Amitabh Bachchan.
I've known him since he was a kid.
When he had left the industry
and was going away to Allahabad...
I stopped him at the railway station.
I asked him why he was leaving.
He said things weren't working out
and that he was going away.
I asked him to hang on.
I called Prakash Mehra...
and got him to sign "Zanjeer".
Which film...?
"Zanjeer"
So which film did I get
Amitabh Bachchan to star in?
I was the one.
I'll make your life too.
So you were the one who
got Amitabh Bachchan "Zanjeer"
Of course. There!
He knows it too!
Smart waiters we have nowadays!
And who called you here?
- The producer P.P. Did.
He is a childhood friend.
- Really?
Don't touch me!
- My name is P.P.
Really? Congratulations!
- Get out!
Bum! You drink free liquor
and talk nonsense... Get out!
I didn't know what to say!
He spoke such nonsense!
He talked as if he knew everyone
from Rekha to Amitabh...
right from their childhood!
You will meet even stranger people.
And everybody has a story to tell.
But I'm not here to
tell stories.
It's as if one gets to
see such a big world...
far removed from our daily lives.
Everything is so beautiful!
There are so many
beautiful things.
There's music, dance,
story, photography...
all of which go to make a film.
Who do you have in the family?
My Papa, Mom and a little brother.
He's a bit of a cartoon.
He's not interested in films.
But when there's a song being
played on Tv...
he keeps looking for me in
the maze of all the dancers...
"There you are, Mili",
he says!
Who do you have in the family?
Let's go. We're getting late.
You've woken up early today.
When did I sleep that I'd wake up?
I couldn't go to sleep...
thinking about the things
that happened at the party.
*I can't go to sleep
*I find no peace
*Will someone get me
some tea...?*
*What are you looking for
in the newspaper?*
I'm looking for something
written about the party...
The party took place only last night.
Who'd get the stuff so early?
It'll take some time.
- It was no ordinary party, daddy.
It was a grand affair! D'you know
how many influential people attended?
It was simply terrific!
They used to take a picture
every other minute.
I was tired wearing a smile
for all the pictures!
What is it?
Well? What's so funny?
I come to you dressed so well.
And you laugh at me!
What's wrong with you?
And what's wrong with you, Munna?
What stuff are you wearing?
Stuff...? This is style, baby.
The latest fashion.
Better than the hero of your film.
Really?
But what's all that style for?
It's my happy birthday.
Your birthday?
Well? Can't I even have
a happy birthday?
I'm going to give you a party.
Where?
Here you are...
I tipped him with 2 bucks.
Why did you have to bring me
to such a big hotel?
I'll show you what
life is all about.
This place is open 24 hours a day.
They've spent so much.
What is it?
Where'll I get a bite?
C'mon.
The guys here know me.
Where do you want to sit?
- Here?
This chair's slipping!
Anybody here?
Boy! Come here!
He wants to know what
you will eat.
So talk to me in Hindi...
what can I have?
No English stuff.
Give us something that is filling.
Get us some onions, to begin with.
And some brain-fry, usal and bread...
egg-curry and rice
with some curry.
Munna!
You don't get that stuff here!
No?
A rotten place! Do you guys
spend only on the furniture?
All right.
Get us anything you like.
And lots. I'm loaded with dough.
Think it's you who's eating.
Listen, switch on the fan.
Switch on the fan.
- The air conditioning is on, sir.
So turn it this way.
That Deepak of Tikuwadi...
- Deepak?
That chap who met us at the fair.
Oh yes. The guy with the bicycle?
- That's him.
What happened to him?
- He has settled down in life.
Settled down?
- I mean, he got married.
Really? Whom has he married?
- Chameli. Who lived in his colony.
They've got married.
They're very happy.
That's what I think too.
One must settle down.
You're right.
You think so too, isn't it?
Just what I think.
One must settle down in life.
Life would be settled if one...
What are you talking about, Munna?
Well... you think one must
settle down in life, isn't it?
That's just what I want.
To settle down in life.
I mean...
all I've told you is that
one must settle down in life.
Kamalji!
Mili!
You?
- What are you doing here?
I came here with my friend, Munna.
I know... you're a good fighter.
What are you doing here?
- I came to see Mr. Kamalakar Rao.
Kamalakar Rao? The director?
- Yes.
Want to meet him?
- Of course!
So let's go.
- Right now?
I'll be back soon, Munna.
Let's go.
Hurry up and bring it!
- One moment. I'm coming.
White Gulab Jamum, mom?
- It's Rossogolla, not gulab-jamun.
But I asked for gulab-jamun!
- This is Mili's choice.
So I made rossogollas.
- Mili! Am I not your son?
Don't give me those filmi lines!
I'll make gulab-jamun tomorrow.
I want it today.
Or I'm not going to eat.
Don't be stubborn, son.
This is extremely delicious.
Try some...
- Not you. keep it back there!
Just one...?
- The doctor has forbidden it.
The doctor forbids sweet for me.
You forbid me from drinking...
Looks like everybody
is stopping me from living!
What are you doing? Didn't I say
I'd make some for you tomorrow?
You're partial towards Mili.
And you keep shouting at me!
I know I'm not your son!
- One slap you'll get!
Eat quietly...
- No, mom! Not for me.
Why not?
- I'm on a diet.
I'm the sucker! I woke up at 6
to make rossogollas for you...
and you're dieting, the doctor
forbids sweets for him...
and this chap doesn't like it!
Even Munna has refused to eat!
Why has Munna refused to eat?
He loves rossogollas.
I sent Motilal to call him.
He says he's not hungry.
Why didn't you come and eat?
- I'm not hungry.
Not hungry...?
You're okay, I hope?
I'm first class.
- So why aren't you hungry?
Just like that.
All right.
I'm not going to eat either.
Why not?
- Just like that.
But I am terribly hungry.
- So eat if you're hungry!
I won't.
- Why not?
Because I want to eat with you.
Let's go.
I can't understand your
mood nowadays, Munna.
That film industry of yours...
it's not right.
What?
know what Pakya said yesterday?
Who the hell is Pakya to say
anything about the film industry?
You are he and great
experts, are you?
Don't tell me! I've seen more
in the world than you have!
Behind all that glitter,
it's so bloody hollow!
Don't I know?
There are a few bad eggs, all right.
That doesn't make all of them evil.
Would I work with them
if they were like that?
Or don't you trust me at all?
- Did I say that?
That's just what you meant.
- You're twisting what I said!
You really do think like that.
I said it only because
I'm worried about you.
Let's go and eat. C'mon.
C'mon...
- I'm not hungry.
C'mon, I say...
- I don't want to eat.
All right.
I'm not going to eat either.
I have rats in my tummy
out of hunger. Big ones.
Let's go.
The sea looks so beautiful
from out here!
Do you own all this land?
- The Government owns some too.
I'm kidding.
I want to build a house here.
- A house? Here?
That's right.
- But there's not a soul here!
That's precisely why.
People run behind you, Kamalji.
And you run away from them.
How do you feel when people
assemble in crowds...
to shake hands with you, or have
themselves photographed with you...
or some to even gape at you?
How d'you expect me to feel?
I know very well...
that they're looking for a Kamal
who fights twenty men on screen...
who runs around those trees
singing songs...
They don't seek the real Kamal
who had to go through so much...
to be the Kamal he is today.
Tell me, Kamalji.
How did you land your first break?
It's a very long story.
- I want to hear it. Now!
You'll find it boring.
- I really want to hear it. Please!
All right.
And then... Kamal turned "Kamalji"
The star!
Suchitra called me funny names too.
When I wore blue, she called me
"Neel Kamal" (the blue lotus).
When I did a scene in water, she
called me "Jal Kamal" (water lotus)
She said that Hollywood
would call me "Lotus kumar"
Who's Suchitra?
You'd have gone crazy with
laughter, if you had met you.
After I became a star,
I had lots of money.
I bought a car. I took Suchitra
on a long drive. To Khandala.
She kept cracking jokes
and I kept laughing...
I drove at top speed and...
In a matter of seconds,
it was all over.
Our dreams of marriage, of a
happy home... were all shattered.
I don't talk about it to anyone.
I can't help it sometimes...
We'll meet at the shoot tomorrow.
I must tell Mili about this!
You will? You don't have the
guts to tell her how you feel.
There you go again.
Had you been in my shoes,
you'd have known.
Admit it! You don't have the guts.
- As if you have it!
know what happened the other day?
- What?
That female Meena...
- Deccan Queen?
That's the one. She was passing by
Gautan Galli the other day.
I caught hold of her and took her
to a quiet corner.
"I want to marry you", I said.
"I'm going to get a room for us"
"Our kids will go to an English school...
will you marry me", I asked.
You said it to her?
- I did!
What happened then?
- What else?
She beat me with her slippers.
- What?!
Slipper?
- Here it is!
Smart-ass! You got beaten up.
And you still brag!
You talk of daring!
- But I did it, didn't I?
I'm not a coward like you!
Show that daring anymore and you'll
soon have to peddle ladies-footwear!
You need a beating, Peter.
You're freaking out nowadays.
They're shooting
a film out there.
Oh yes! They're shooting
a film down there!
Let's get down there
and take a look.
Let's take a look at the heroine!
C'mon!
A few strands of hair down
like this... the natural look.
Just a few strands.
That bus we wanted for tomorrow's
shoot... we can't have it, sir.
Could we manage with an autorickshaw?
- We'll manage with even a bicycle.
What's okay?
- The autorickshaw...?
I'll call pack up if
I don't have the bus!
Your producer wants to
make the film with nothing!
I'm not into television serials!
I'm making a 70 mm feature film!
I'll halt the shoot if I don't
have the bus. Understand?
I want the bus!
No compromises!
How will someone ever make
a film like this? How?
These rich guys are such misers!
And what will happen of art?
I want to create things...
how will that happen?
And I'm not competing
with the local guys!
I'm competing with Copolla.
With Spielberg!
How do I make them understand?
I just don't know!
You tell me... how can anyone
ever make a real, artistic film?
I understand your predicament.
And who are you?
- I came to watch you shoot.
The shoot?
Get lost... Get going!
The shot's ready, Miliji.
- The heroine's ready!
Will you tango with me?
Such an ill-mannered crowd.
I wonder where they come from.
You there! Hero! If you're man
enough, how about fighting me?
You get into fights in the movies.
How about a fight with me...?
"I'm in love with you, Rakesh..."
I love you too, baby!
Don't pay any attention to them.
Just concentrate on your lines.
Come, let's sing a song.
Hey darling...!
Kamal... call me just Kamal.
How can I be so informal?
What's the problem? We've got to
work together, meet each other...
Imagine me calling you "Miliji"
for every little thing!
Well? You think you're
very smart, don't you?
You're the bully
in your locality.
You talk so much when you're
up against the cops.
But when it comes to saying
something to the girl...
you blow a fuse!
You're speechless!
You ought to drown out of shame,
you ass!
Looks like I'll have to do
something about it.
Had she been here right now,
I swear I'd have told her.
What would you have said?
- I...
What would you have said, Munna?
I... what will I say?
Damn it!
Anybody around?
Wake up, guys!
Shut that thunder!
Are you listening...?
Wake up!
Who is it? Why are you screaming?
Who are you...?
Why are you yelling?
Who the hell are you?
You've wrecked my windowpane!
My heart is worth millions.
That has been wrecked.
And you're crying over
a measly windowpanes!
Come down here...
I'll tell you my love story today.
*What must I do and what
mustn't I do is the problem*
*Someone tell me the way
out of this predicament*
*On the one hand,
I'm very much in love with her...*
*On the other hand,
I'm afraid to tell her*
*What I must do and what I mustn't
is the problem*
*Someone tell me the way
out of this predicament*
*On the one hand,
I do love her*
*On the other,
I'm afraid to tell her*
*I think everyday that
should I meet her...*
*I'll tell her this,
and tell her that...*
*I'll reveal to her
the secrets of my heart*
*But she has to come before me
and my heart skips a beat*
*And I find myself tongue-tied*
*So what am I to do?
And what mustn't I do?*
*Someone tell me a way out
of this predicament*
*I sure do love her*
*And I'm scared to tell her*
*What am I to do...?
What mustn't I do?*
*Suggest a way out someone*
*It's no big deal.
I could have said it to her*
*All I'm scared of
is a refusal*
*Must I tell her now?
Or later...? And where?*
*She left, even as I wondered*
*What am I to do...?
And what mustn't I?*
*Suggest a way out of this,
someone*
*Will someone...?*
*Will someone...?*
Mili...
She's gone to sleep.
Gone to asleep?
- Yes.
So early?
- She must've been tired.
Come. Have a drink.
What do you get
out of drinking?
Some people drink to
forget their past...
some drink to revive the memories.
And there are guys like me who
drink without any reason, Munna.
I want to ask you something, uncle.
I hope you won't mind?
What are you talking about!
Have you ever been in love?
Love? What a topic to discuss, Munna!
Let me pour myself
another drink. Okay?
It happened when I was in the
first year of graduation.
She was into the first year, too.
For four years,
we came and went in the same bus...
the same timing, the same route.
Really?
Our love story moved ahead
with the bus.
What happened then?
What else? She married someone
who drove around in a car...
and I got left behind in the bus.
- But why?
Not her mistake.
We lost out because I wasn't sure
whether I should speak to her.
I just couldn't tell her
how I felt!
You're telling me...
- I learnt a lesson, however.
Cause no delay in
speaking your heart.
You're right. Make no delay.
Make no delay.
I must leave now.
- Very well.
Dada!
What is it?
Have you ever been in love?
What...?
- Have you been in love?
Tell me!
- I'll tell you!
She was so very beautiful.
But I couldn't have her.
- But I've found mine!
You've found Mili?!
Got it?
- Mili...?
They've got permission
for the outdoor shoot.
In Goa?
- Don't shout.
How did she go there?
- In a car.
I know that.
But what for?
She's gone to shoot for
the film. What else?
How could she go away like that?
She didn't even tell me.
The producer made a sudden program.
So she left early this morning.
*A life of loneliness...
that's not done*
*You have no companion...
that's not done*
*Give someone your love;
and have someone's love in return*
*Love is what you want
in the world*
*To lead a life of loneliness
is not done*
*You have no companion...
that's not done*
*Give someone your love;
enjoy her affection*
*That's the best thing
in the world*
*To lead a life of loneliness
is not done*
*You ought to dream of someone*
*You ought to have
someone in your arms*
*You ought to have a companion
in your journey through life*
*You must have a companion
in your journey through life*
*Life though is a punishment...*
*but to have someone
would make it fun*
*To lead a life of loneliness
is hardly the thing*
*You have no beloved;
that is hardly done*
*Give your love to someone;
enjoy her love*
*That's the best thing
in the world*
*To lead a life of loneliness
is hardly done*
*Apart from the earth and the sky,
there's so much here*
*The waves lash us...
here I am*
*Even the moonlight seems
to be saying something to us*
*Even the moonlight seems
to be saying something to us*
*Something is saying something
to you from the heart*
*Distances won't do...
come closer*
*To lead a life of loneliness
is hardly the done thing*
*You have no beloved...
that's hardly done*
*Give her your love;
enjoy hers*
*That's the best thing
in the world*
*To lead a life of loneliness
is hardly the done thing*
*It's hardly done...*
*it's hardly done*
*it's hardly done*
*To lead a life of loneliness
is hardly the done thing*
*You have no beloved;
that's not done*
*Give someone your love;
enjoy her love...*
Fantastic! If this song clicks,
our film's gonna be a hit!
I'm not worried anymore.
Will the film be a hit,
just because the song clicks?
Of course! Look at the record
of any recent success.
"Tezaab" for instance.
The number, "Ek, do, teen..."
Or the case of "khalnayak".
"Choli ke peechhe kya hai..."
Wasn't that a hit?
You had four hit songs
in your last film.
Why didn't the film do well?
- Well...
It's up to the director
to make a hit film!
Up to whom?
- The director.
What...?
- The director, I said.
Whom is it up to to make a hit film?
- Up to you, sir!
The loudmouth!
Do you know why my
last film flopped?
Well, what was the
name of the film...?
That's not what
I'm talking about!
I didn't take the print of my film
to the shrine at Tirupati. That's why!
What are you doing up there?
Come here!
Get back there!
- Don't touch me!
I'm Mili's friend, I say!
- They all say that. Get lost!
You'll get a punch!
Don't you touch me!
There... you've had it!
You must know whom
you're talking to.
How did you get here?
I've come straight
from the bus-station.
You know him, Kamalji? Remember...
you met him at the restaurant?
Oh yes... Raju.
- No. The name is Munna.
What brings you here suddenly?
- Wouldn't I come today?
But what for?
- Isn't it your birthday today?
You haven't told us
it's your birthday!
What's so great about that?
Listen! It's Mili's birthday!
What are you thinking about?
Don't think too much.
Or you'll miss the bus.
Remember the film you saw?
How did the hero...
present a ring to the heroine
and they fall in love?
Go ahead and give her the ring.
Play the hero!
Get on with it!
Munna! Look at what
Kamalji has given me!
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I didn't want to take it.
But he insisted!
It's so very beautiful.
But I don't like it.
It will look beautiful
only when you have worn it.
One moment.
What do you do for a living?
I sell tickets in the black-market.
- What?
I sell tickets in the black
outside cinema halls.
It looks beautiful now.
But not more than you are.
Shall we go?
Munna! C'mon!
Where's Munna?
- Who's that?
When did you return from Goa?
- Last night.
And you didn't even meet me!
- Why should I have met you?
I was dying to know what happened.
- What was to happen?
Did you talk to her?
- Talk to whom?
Mili, of course! Who else?
No, nothing.
- Nothing?
Nothing, I say!
- Why not?
I said there was nothing!
Don't bother me!
You went to talk to her, right?
- But I didn't get the chance. So?
Don't bother me!
Go away!
*What is love...?*
*It's so strange...*
*It hurts*
*It gives peace*
*It gives joy.
It gives sorrow*
*What is love...?*
*It's so strange...*
*It hurts*
*It gives solace*
*It gives joy;
it gives sorrow*
*What is love*
*It's so strange*
*It hurts;
it soothes*
*It gives joy;
it gives sorrow*
*I spend my days
thinking about her*
*My nights too,
I spend missing her*
*I dream of our union*
*And flowers and roses announce
the arrival of spring*
*Bees swarm around the flowers*
*May our hearts always
be filled with love*
*What is love...?*
*It's so strange*
*It hurts;
it soothes*
*It gives sorrow;
it gives joy*
*Like a dream
in my eyes*
*Like a thought
in the form of a dream*
*As we walk through
the hot sun...*
*a beloved who would
provide me shade*
*Our destination we
reach or not...*
*be there storms...*
*it teaches every lover
the way of life*
*What is love...?*
*It's so strange*
*It hurts;
it soothes*
*It's a source of happiness;
it gives sorrow*
*What is love...?*
*It's so strange*
*It hurts;
it soothes*
*It's a source of joy
and sorrows*
Dada!
- Mr. P.P.?!
*Give someone your love...
enjoy her affection*
*That's the dearest
thing in the world*
*To lead a life of loneliness
is no life*
What's up?
- Our first print is out!
Congratulations...
when was it out?
I just saw it at the lab.!
What a film!
Our distributors are going to
book each theater for 2 years!
If this film doesn't click,
I'm going back to Ludhiana!
As for Mili...
what a performance!
She's fantastic!
When can I see the film?
- Any time you want to!
Sweeten his tongue!
You've been sitting here and
I've been looking for you everywhere.
There's a screening of my film.
At 8 p.m.
Be there. I'll wait for you.
Don't be late!
Bring Pakya along too!
What a fantastic dancer!
I haven't forgotten.
Of course I'll remind him.
There's a screening of
the film this evening.
I want to give this to Mili.
But I don't know why...
I have a fear.
What fear?
After Suchitra's death,
I'm scared of every joy.
Lest the happiness be
snatched away from me.
How can you think of such things?
You ought to be happy. Not scared.
Besides, the two of you will
make a terrific couple.
I have just one dream now.
I want to see you married.
*What's wrong with you...?*
*You have been
pestering me all the time*
*You are so very beautiful...
how can I control myself*
*Go away...
I feel shy*
*It's this charm of yours
that I'm bowled over by*
*My God...!
You are so very insistent*
*Let me go...
you've begun to scare me*
*I've decided to spend my days
and nights, making love*
*What makes you so scared
of my love, O beloved*
*What's wrong with you...
You've been pestering me always*
*You're so bewitching...
how can I keep myself in control*
*Go away...
I feel shy*
*It's this very charm of yours
that has bowled me over*
*Your fair arms, your body...
they make me so restless*
*Your wet lips and
your intoxicating eyes...*
*awaken the desires in me*
*Let go of my arms...*
*don't block my path*
*Say not such things...*
*Let me go*
*What's gotten into you...?
You've been pestering me so*
*You're so seductive...
how can I be unaffected?*
*Go away...
I'm shy*
*It's this very charm of yours
that has bowled me over*
What's wrong? I've been calling out
to you and you're... what's up?
And I wondered whether
I was late.
Shall we go?
I...
- Yes?
There's something...
- What is it?
Any problem with the film?
God! Can't you think of anything
but the film?
Not me.
You've had so many releases, Kamal.
You won't understand.
But to see myself on the screen
for the first time...
do you know how scared I am?
Have you ever been scared?
- No. Never earlier.
What does that mean?
Nothing. Shall we go?
Welcome...
Look. This is the response
before the film's release.
We'll need the army to control
the crowds on its release!
Sit down...
Get up, you guys.
Who are you?
We're Mili's friends.
That heroine of yours...
Fantastic! They're all the
heroine's and hero's friends.
And the producer's enemies!
Are you here for a party?
Never mind, P.P.
I'll see the film later.
No, sir.
You will see the film today.
Get up... do you want me
to call the security guards?
They land up for a free show!
- Let's go, Pakya.
Go on... don't stare!
Please sit down, sir...
you too.
I'll get them to start the film.
Okay?
You guys are still here?
Didn't I ask you to go away?
Don't you touch me!
Or you'll get a punch!
Oh get lost!
You too...
Whom do you think you're pushing!
I'll teach you a lesson!
I'll smash your face!
Munna! What are you doing?
I asked him to occupy another seat.
There are distributors here...
and he started
abusing and hitting me.
Munna! What behavior is this?
It's our film! And this is how
you behave with the guests?
At least listen to me, Mili...
- That's okay.
Welcome, Mr. Kamal...
they're waiting for you.
And Mili was angry with us, Munna!
Let's go.
One moment, Mili...
This way, Mili...
this way!
Kamal! What are you doing?
You're a big star now!
So this is inevitable...
Never mind all that.
You haven't told me what
you think of my performance.
What did I think of it?
The world applauded you!
Not the world...
I want to know how you felt.
Want to know the truth?
That shot on the beach,
where you're looking at me...
I just loved it.
You looked absolutely beautiful.
I mean it.
- You're embarrassing me.
I swear...
You looked beautiful...
What for?
For those things I said
to you at the theater.
I so badly wanted to see the film...
that I told you whatever
came to my mind.
I've made a mistake.
- How is it your mistake?
There were so many
big personalities there.
It wouldn't have been proper
for me to be among them.
What you did was right.
I should have known better.
Munna! Why are you
saying such things?
I admit I've made a mistake!
Forget it.
How was the film?
I can't believe it, Munna!
People liked the film so much!
There was applause in every scene!
As for me...
they adored me, Munna!
I missed you very much
when that happened.
How I bored you to death
with my fascination for films.
Remember what a scene I created...
when I came to your place
one night?
I said, "You must rehearse with me"
You should've been there, when the
audience applauded that scene today.
The film has its premiere
the day after tomorrow.
I want us both to
watch the film together.
Never have I awaited anything as
eagerly as I await this day, Munna.
A dream I dreamt
as a child...
will now be fulfilled.
And it has happened
thanks to Kamalji.
Without Kamalji, I wouldn't
have been able to do anything.
I don't know how I'd manage.
I wouldn't have
achieved so much.
Welcome...
You're so late!
I didn't know what to wear!
She took so much time, I thought
we'd reach for the silver jubilee.
Where's Munna?
- He's not coming.
He has sent this letter.
- What letter?
How'd I know? Read it for yourself.
- But where is he?
I don't know. But he
behaved very strangely.
He must be somewhere. Let's go.
- Yes. We'll see about him later.
Funny chap. What's the fuss for?
- What happened?
Nothing.
You have been watching a colorful
evening..."Rangeela" (colorful one).
Are you happy?
- Very much!
I want to tell you something
after the function is over.
What is it?
After the function.
Tell me!
- After the function.
"I'm leaving Mili"
"There's something I always
wanted to tell you"
"I love you very much"
"But I have come to
realize something today"
"You aren't made for me"
"I'm too small a man. And you
belong to the world of the rich"
"It's someone like Kamal
that you should marry"
"What Kamal can give you..."
"I will never be able to"
"But I can't bear to see you
with someone else, Mili"
"I don't possess such a big heart"
"And so I'm leaving this town.
Forever"
"You must think I'm talking
nonsense at a time like this"
"But, Mili..."
"I had to tell you how I felt"
"Forgive me, if I have
done something wrong"
"I'm leaving"
"Good bye"
What's up?
Get the car, Kamalji!
I've got to go!
I must go immediately!
Get the car!
What's happened...?
Munna has gone away.
Munna who?
Munna! You know him, don't you?
He has left.
Did you leave the show
for something so little?
You don't understand, Kamal.
Do you know what he thinks?
He's so crazy!
I don't know how he got
this notion that...
that the two of us
have fallen in love...
and that we're going
to get married.
He's such a fool!
He's leaving town.
He writes that he loves me.
As if I'm not worried
about him at all.
I love him, too.
But that doesn't mean you walk out
on the one you love.
Where will I look for him?
Oh where?!
Where's Munna?
He has left.
- Left? Where has he gone?
Why do you want to know?
- Don't act funny, Pakya.
Stop acting filmi with me!
Do you know the things
he did for you?
With every penny he had saved,
he bought a gift...
and went to Goa to meet you.
But gifts mean nothing to you!
He went to see your film.
He asked me to join him.
And you insulted him
in front of everyone!
Why?
Because you wanted to become
a big film star!
And here... on these pavements,
he spent nights dreaming of you.
He kept me awake till
2 and 3 a.m. Every night.
Why?
To talk to me about you!
All the money he had
saved for his marriage...
he has given me
before leaving.
He said, "Use the money
for your marriage, Pakya"
Damn it!
I've begun to hate love and
marriage after knowing about you!
Go away, Mili.
We can discuss all
these things later, Pakya.
First tell us where Munna is.
Munna!
Mili? You?!
Where are you going?
What's all this about?
Now look, Mili. I wrote whatever
I had to say to you.
And what did you write?
- I can understand, Mili.
I understand everything.
I don't want to be an obstacle.
I don't want to create a scene.
Be happy, the two of you.
I just want to see you happy, Mili.
I swear!
Munna!
What misunderstanding is this?
What made you think that I'm in
love with her and want to marry her?
How could you imagine
such things?
We're actors, after all.
We spend time working together.
That doesn't mean we'll
spend our lives together.
She left the premiere of her first
film to look for you all night.
Mili loves you very much.
I swear.
That's what she herself told me.
She's angry. Watch out, buddy.
How'd I know you're in...
Not another word.
Or you're going to get a thrashing!
You didn't tell me when you had to.
And you're saying it now!
You could have said it too.
- Sure, I could.
Did you want me to scream
from rooftops that...
Why are you screaming now?
- Shut up!
Or I'll give you a pasting!
- Don't touch me, I warn you.
And you won't touch me either!
What are you going to do?
What...?
This is why I didn't tell you.
- So don't tell me!
You will run away from me, will you?
Who do you think you are?
Where will you go?
- I said sorry, haven't I?
Don't hit me...
I said sorry.
Where will you go...?
