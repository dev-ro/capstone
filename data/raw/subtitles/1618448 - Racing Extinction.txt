into the blue.

breathless, waiting.

right underneath me

"that's interesting."
i look, and there's fishing line
tailing off the top of its body.

is i swam down.
i snipped the line off
the top of its head,
right just above the hook.
and swam up.
she didn't swim away.
she was just hovering
right underneath me.
so i swim back down to her
one more time,
and i put my hand gently
right on the front of her head,
and i put my hand on the hook,
and i slowly worked that hook
right out of its top jaw.
and i thought, "that's it.
you know, she's gonna
swim off now."
she's been saved.
i look down, and she's
circling right under my feet.
so i swim back down to her
one more time,
and i put my hand right next
to where the injury was,
as if sort of rubbing it
and saying, "hey, listen.
you're gonna be okay."
and i put my head
right next to her eye,

moving back and forth
between my mask,
looking at both my eyes,

we want them to get
an entirely new view,
that the stuff they
go out in the water
and they see every day
and they stick a spear in
is worth far more
alive than dead.
the concept of converting
this hunting culture
to a tourism culture on the
surface seems pretty daunting,
but we show them
the success stories
that we've had
in these other areas,
places in the world
that had very little
and now are thriving.

hilton: these kids are gonna
be really influenced by this,
and they're gonna be
the guides of the future.
we're just bringing a message.
it's really up to them.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
something's up in the air.
oh, nice.
goodall:
we can make this happen.
as we face more
and more animal extinctions,
we need more and more
of these indomitable spirits.
and we need more people
to understand it's worth doing.
the small choices
we make each day
can lead to the kind of world
that we all want for the future.

heinrichs:
there was a reverend in japan.
he had a statement
which really struck me,
and it was "better to light one
candle than curse the darkness."
there's so many people
who sit back and say,
"we're screwed,"
or, you know, "why bother?"
♪♪
but you know what?
that candle --
that candle means something,
because with that one candle,
maybe someone else
with a candle will find you.
and i think that's where
movements are started.

overwhelming.
but if we start with just one
thing, we can start a movement.
