Mr. Mitchell?
Yeah. What do you want?
We spoke on the phone several times.
I'm Dr. Turner.
Yeah. Well... nothing's changed.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
That's it, then.
It doesn't have to be this way.

My wife is dying and she
Your wife is suffering.
It's within your power to stop that.
You're not coming in.
Do it yourself, then.
- Any of you.
- I told you before
I've included instructions
on how to operate it.
We're not interested.
- What about the rest of your family?

We're talking about your wife here,

That doctor came by earlier.
- The one who's been calling?
- Yep.
[T.J. CLEARS THROAT]
[STUTTERS] Why'd he give it to you, Pop?
Said we could do it ourselves,
any one of us.
What about Brad and Travis?
What about them? They want their cut, too.
You really wanna have
that conversation now?
No.
Yeah. Yeah, I do, actually.
Use your fucking head, Ronnie, will you?
Hey, I am using my fucking head.
- What's the matter with you
- No, no!
You're not.
[SNIFFLES]
[SIGHS]
Your mother got a lot of money
when Travis and Brad's father died.
A lot.
Yeah, Pop. We know.
- That's why we're here with
- Shut up.
Shut up.
Now, that money has been locked up
in a separate account for years.
And I made it
so that when she passes,
that money goes to me.
That means...
that when my time comes, by law,
that money will all go to you two.
[RONNIE] What are you... [GRUNTS]
[CHUCKLES]
[STUTTERS] Yeah, I don't know what you...
Fuck. What are you talking about, Pop?
- "When your time comes"?
- Yeah, that's right.
Not to that degenerate outside,
not to his asshole brother.
But if you keep running your mouth
about inheritances and whatever else,
they might just change their minds
about all this.
And if that's what ends up happening...
well, I hope you know a good lawyer.
- [T.J.] You think it still runs?
- [RONNIE SIGHS]
[SNIFFLES] Don't know.
I'd take it with me
if I had time to ride it,
but I'm busy working all the goddamn time.
[T.J.] Then maybe you should sell it.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Hopefully, after all this,
I won't have to.
- Now...

[RONNIE] When'd you get out?

I don't know, T.J., are you?
What are you doing for work?

[RONNIE] Oh, yeah? What kind of things?
[TRAVIS SIGHS]
What do you care, Ronnie?
Well, me and T.J. just talked to Dad.
[TRAVIS] Your dad, not mine.
Whatever.
He's holding all the cards, you know.
- Especially yours.
- [T.J.] Ronnie.
[RONNIE] No, no, he should...
he should hear this.
He's, uh...
He's... he's cutting you out.
You and Brad.
- [T.J.] What are you doing, Ronnie?
- Shut up.
Shut up.
Why are you telling me this, Ronnie?
Because you're my brother.
So, yeah.
Those things you're doing...
hopefully they pay good.

This is Melissa.
Hi.
Hi.
These are my brothers. T.J., Ronnie.
Half-brothers.
Um, Brad's told me a lot
about both of you.
He shouldn't have told you anything.
[SIGHS] Who's this?
She's a friend.
Do you understand what's going on here?
I'm just here to help Brad through this.

[GROANS]
I found this up in the attic last week.
It's your mother's old diary.
But before we get to that,
let's get something else out of the way.
Because I know you all saw the bag.
You all know what's in it
and you all know what it will do.
[SIGHS]
But being able to do it ourselves
doesn't change a goddamn thing
and that's that.
"June 10th, 1982.
I'm trying to move on, day by day.
The church has been so supportive,
but I'm still struggling.
I know it's horrible to say,
but Bradley's death was like a gift.
I certainly prayed for an accident
like that enough times.
And now, as I'm struggling to move on,
I'm being told that I have to decide
what to do with his remains.
Whenever my time comes,
and that decision has to be made for me,
I can only hope it's made
by someone who cares about me.
And not by someone who's glad I'm dead."
So...
we should discuss her arrangements
for once this is over.
Well, I'm not ready to think
that far ahead yet.
The hell does that mean?
Okay, I don't know
what you two are trying to pull...
but whatever it is, it ain't gonna work.
No one's trying to pull anything, Ronnie.
Maybe he just cares about his mother.
Well, maybe you should shut up
and mind your fucking business.
How about you fucking try that
for a fucking change.
- [BRAD] Shut up, Ronnie!
- [MELISSA] Hey, hey, hey!
- [T.J.] Ronnie, come on.
- [MELISSA] Get off of him!
- [GEORGE] Knock it off!
- [MELISSA] Hey! Hey, stop, stop!
- Stop. Stop.
- [T.J.] All right, back up. Back up.
Okay.
This ain't gonna end good for you.
You either.
And you. You, whatever you think's
going on here, you're wrong.
What are you doing?
[TRAVIS] Nothing, man.
Just looking around.
I remember that.
Mom and her religion.
Hocus-pocus bullshit.
She always thought
I stole the missing piece.
She never said it,
but I know she thought it.
Man, you don't know that.
Yeah, well, I wasn't you.
[SIGHS]
You made your own choices, Travis.
Yeah. I know I did, Brad. I still do.
I accept who I am.
What, and I don't?
You say you're not ready
to think that far ahead yet?
That's fine.
I mean, it's bullshit. But it's fine.
But don't pretend
that actually makes you any better
than the rest of us in all this.
It doesn't.
It makes you worse.
I'm gonna, uh, set the alarm for 7:15.
Whatever you want.
[CLEARS THROAT]
[BRAD EXHALES HEAVILY]
I'm sorry about all that stuff earlier
by the fire.
[MELISSA] There's...
there's something I need to ask you.
[SNIFFLES]
What did Ronnie mean
when he said that I don't know
what's really going on?
[BRAD] I'm sorry,
I should have told you this.
[MELISSA] So, tell me.
[BRAD] Her pain.
My mother's pain...
there's a way to make it go away.
[MELISSA] Is that what's in the black bag?
[BRAD SIGHS]
Yes.
Then why wouldn't you? [CHUCKLES]
It's not that simple.
[MELISSA]
But if the end result is the same,
why would you let her suffer?
Good night.
[EKG BEEPING]
[RONNIE] We should replace the truck, too.
Thing's a piece of shit.
Oh, it's not the truck, it's the economy.
[RONNIE SIGHS]
Okay, how'd it go at the bank?
Not good. [CLEARS THROAT]
[RONNIE] Okay, what about the other place?
The credit union?
Well, no.
That's not gonna happen there either.
Nobody's giving out any loans.
Well, we gotta do what we gotta do, then.
[T.J.] Oh, man.
What?
It's Mom's wedding photo. From her church.
I've never seen Brad Sr. before.
Me neither.
Did you know anything about him?
Only that he used to
beat the shit outta Mom.
