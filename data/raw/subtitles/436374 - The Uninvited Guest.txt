THE UNINVITED GUEST
DAY 1
ENTRANCE
STUDY
What are you doing?
Nothing. I was just
looking for something.
You could have called.
I didn't think you were home.
- Didn't you see the lights on?
- Yes, but they're always on.
How did you get in?
- Give me them.
- No.
- Come on, Vera, give me them.
- I won't give them to you, Felix.
This is my house now, Vera.
Yeah? Well, these are still my things.
Let's see.
I don't feel like arguing, okay?
I don't want to bother at all.
I'll give them back to you
when I get all of my things.
And when will that be?
When I can get to it.
Could you stop making
so much noise, please?
Thanks.
Shit, Felix.
What are you looking for?
Nothing, just some reports I need.
- Want some help?
- No thanks.
Did you find your portrait?
No.
How about you?
No, me neither.
Do you still want it?
Of course.
I'd love to have it.
It must be up here in the attic...
in one of these boxes.
One of these hundreds of boxes.
How's the new apartment?
Fine.
That's good.
What's it like?
You wouldn't like it,
it's too small.
- How many square feet?
- About 350.
- That's all?
- Yeah, that's all.
Even if it were smaller, it would
still be better than living here.
You're going to miss all that space.
I don't think so, Felix.
- I don't need very much...
- If you're sharing it.
Look, you find couples all the time
living in 350 square feet.
You can't even find yourself
in your own house.
It's too big.
Too organized.
- Too... perfect.
- I've always needed space.
Your things are still here
since you took off two months ago.
Two months.
So you can finally
take them with you.
This place looks like a warehouse.
They will be out by tomorrow.
Sure.
They will be gone by tomorrow.
I promise.
DAY 2
Again?
You dirty-ass dog.
Come here.
Don't even think about.
Don't even...
Vico? Vico?
Leave Vico alone.
What do you think you're doing?
What do you think I'm doing?
Getting your dog out of my kitchen.
- You can't control him.
- He's just a dog.
Yeah, a dog who barks all day long.
He barks because
he wants to say something.
What he wants is to sneak in my kitchen
every morning.
So what?
If I wanted a dog I'd buy one.
Do you understand, Mrs. Miller?
It's Mueller, not Miller.
I don't care.
Mr. Felix, maybe you'd be
better off with a dog.
Even more so now that you're alone.
He'd keep you company
and "he'd" treat the neighbors decently.
Look, do me a favor
and get out of my house.
I don't want your dog
in my kitchen ever again, got it?
And don't you ever put your hands
on my dog again. You got it?
- Good day, Mrs. Mueller.
- Auf wiedersehen, Herr Felix.
Herr Felix.
Yes, Mr. Gilberto, I know.
We had to build another kitchen...
another room.
We had to double the rooms.
Modifications like that always result
in a smaller kitchen on one end
or a larger room on the other end.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
We'll talk later.
She's not coming in?
I'm sorry to bother you so late,
but could I make a call?
What?
May I use your phone?
There's a phone booth
right over there.
I know, but it doesn't work.
It's very urgent.
Yes, of course, if it's so important.
Thank you.
Your house is huge.
Thank you. You like it?
Of course.
I remodeled it myself.
How many square feet?
About 4,000.
With the basement, of course.
It must have a basement.
Yes.
Well, here you go.
Thank you, you're very kind.
Could you give me a moment, please?
Of course, I'm sorry.
Take your time.
Feel at home.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Are you down there?
Hello?
...over time, the cuckoo is born first,
who makes sure to get out of the way
of his future step-siblings,
pushing the eggs toward
the outer part of the nest.
Once he gets alone,
he'll get the necessary food
from his step-parents.
Is someone there?
DAY 3
Where's the restroom, please?
Are you going to let me in?
So what do you think
of the apartment?
- Well, it's centrally located.
- Yeah, the view is terrible.
It gets good light.
The shower is not very discreet either.
It's practical having it so close by.
Now you're going to tell me
that it's not small.
Small? No, it's...
It's very cozy.
- It's very charming.
- Yeah.
And it's intimidating, as well.
- Yeah.
- It's ideal.
Yeah, it's ideal.
It's ideal for you...
and for a couple as well.
Isn't that what you said?
With 350 square feet they'd be bumping
into each other every minute.
Yeah, or they would end up
killing each other.
It reminds me
of my apartment in college.
It was just like this one.
No... please.
Stop right there, all right?
It seems like there is no space for us.
I'm really sorry.
It doesn't matter anyway,
I was just kidding.
- It's all over.
- Over.
It's not over either.
You can count on me whenever.
- What mean "count on you whenever"?
- Well, yeah.
There's too long of a history
between us for there not to be...
a friendship, right?
- A friendship?
- Yes, a friendship.
You can call me when you want...
if you ever need anything.
Great. I'm the only one
who needs you.
Felix, no.
I need you at times, too, you know?
Sometimes I'd do anything
to have you by my side.
Then why did you leave?
- What sense does this make?
- I don't want to talk about that.
- Is there someone else?
- What?
Another person?
Shit. I have to go.
Felix, there isn't anybody else.
Not in the way that you think.
Damn.
Police.
Police.
There's someone in my house.
Be careful. He's probably armed
with a knife.
- Sir.
- Yes?
Come upstairs, please.
What?
There's no one here.
Have you searched the entire house?
Yes, of course.
He couldn't have left.
Could you tell us exactly
where you saw him?
He was in the study.
I thought I saw him in there.
"I thought"?
So you didn't really see him.
Of course I really saw him.
I'm telling you he was there.
Where did you supposedly see him?
Where?
- There.
- Where?
Right there.
Here, underneath the table.
Right.
Well, there's no one here either.
Right.
Not here, not anywhere in this house.
But... are you sure?
What do you think?
I ask because he could be hiding.
Hiding?
Yes, hiding.
The house is very big and filled
with nooks.
He could have hidden in a closet.
Or behind a piece of furniture,
or a door, I don't know.
He could even be
moving around
and hiding in the places
you've already looked.
Have you looked underneath the bed?
Is there a portrait of a woman?
Maybe I'm just on edge.
Maybe I just thought that...
Good night.
So, what's wrong?
- Have you eaten?
- Yeah, a little while ago.
Would you like a drink?
No, thank you.
So, what's up?
What do you mean "what"?
Why did you call me?
I can't call you?
We're friends, right?
Yes we're friends.
But you told me it was urgent,
that's why I came over.
That's what I said?
How's the new job?
Fine, fine.
My boss told me I'd be traveling a lot.
That's great, huh?
What did you say?
Are you listening to me, or what?
What?
You know what?
It's late, I'm tired
and I want to sleep.
- Are you leaving?
- What does it look like?
I'll walk you to the door.
That's not necessary.
I know the way.
- Vera.
- What do you want?
What?
What are you doing, Felix?
Are you all right?
You're trembling.
What?
Stay with me.
Don't leave, please.
Don't leave.
Don't leave.
Stay here, please.
Don't leave me alone.
Okay, okay, settle down.
What's wrong?
I think someone's in the house.
What do you mean someone's in the...
Someone is living in this house.
He lives here and I can't find him.
He's upstairs right now,
don't you hear that?
- Felix, what are...
- Vera, believe me.
Believe me, please.
Don't you hear them?
What should I be hearing?
Those sounds.
- That?
- Yes, that noise.
Wait.
Come here.
- What are you doing?
- We're going to check it out.
- What?
- We're going to see if anyone is there.
If we find him, we'll tell him
to leave and to stop making noises.
It's coming from the kid's room.
- Don't make fun.
- I'm sorry.
Stop laughing, Vera.
Have you seen yourself?
- I'm acting like a kid, huh?
- Yes.
A big, dumb kid.
Imagine if I were a dad.
Enough already.
You don't need to make up these stories
in order to hug me.
You don't have to do that
just to reveal your feelings.
All of this is painful for me too.
All of this.
And when I think about it,
I begin to doubt...
and I miss you.
I miss touching you.
I miss the smell of your body...
your laugh...
and your caresses.
No, Felix.
We can't do this.
No, Felix, we can't.
That's not a reason.
It will only complicate things.
Things are already complicated, Vera.
That's not a reason either.
Maybe there is someone there...
and they're watching us.
I should go.
It's pretty late.
That's why.
Stay here with me.
I don't want to sleep alone.
Not tonight.
What was he like?
Who?
That man.
What was he like?
Where are you going?
To the study.
What are you doing?
Answering your question.
The guy who's staying here
is handsome.
It doesn't make sense, does it?
It wouldn't make any sense to do that.
Stay in a house and try to live in it
while hiding...
and only coming out
when the owner is gone.
You couldn't always hide.
Sooner or later you would slip up...
and you would give yourself away...
and I would find you...
unless, of course, you knew how
to hide really well...
move really quietly...
calculate every movement.
You have to behave almost like a...
like a parasite.
A parasite from space.
You would be Parasite-Man... that's it.
And that...
that's impossible.
How stupid.
You'll see how you find him.
We should tell him...
...that you're here inside.
Before he finds you.
Because one day he'll find out.
You scared me, Felix.
What were you doing?
Nothing, I came down
because I was thirsty.
Who were you talking to?
What?
I said, who were you talking to?
Nobody.
Felix, what are you doing?
What's wrong, honey?
You were talking to him.
To him? Who do you think
I was talking to?
- You know very well who.
- To who?
To him. He even laughed.
- Have you gone mad?
- Where is he?
- Shut up, damn it, you're scaring me.
- Tell me where he is.
Okay, Felix, I'll explain...
Tell me where he is!
Let go of me. Don't touch me.
- How can you do this to me, Vera?
- Stop it now, Felix!
No, Felix, please.
Don't hurt me.
I'm sorry.
Vera, honey.
I'm scared too.
I didn't mean to hurt you, okay?
I would never hurt you.
That's why I won't move from this spot.
I won't even come near you.
I won't chase after you,
nor try to stop you.
But listen to me.
Just listen to me.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I'm... I'm confused.
I'm asking you not to leave.
Let's talk.
Give me a second chance.
Start over.
From the beginning, you and me.
Please.
I'm just asking for a second chance.
To prove that I can live with you.
DAY 4
Come here, handsome.
Come in here with me.
Search. Search.
I need you to search.
What are you doing with my dog?
The dog knows.
He knows he's upstairs.
Don't follow the dog.
Don't follow the dog, you hear me?
Don't follow the dog.
Mrs. Mueller, leave him be.
Leave him alone.
My God.
Mrs. Mueller.
You were pushed, weren't you?
Were you pushed?
She slipped.
Slipped?
Yes.
She was running after her dog,
followed him up the stairs,
got tangled up in the leash,
she lost her balance
and fell down the stairs.
No. This was an accident.
- Are you sure?
- Yes... an accident.
Anything weird happen?
Weird?
What could be weird?
Your neighbor, Mrs. Helga Mueller,
was an older woman,
and at that age
they're falling all over the place.
Those things happen.
So you're not going to arrest me?
Arrest you?
No. You may go home.
You just need to sign this paper
and that's it.
Unless you were to detain me...
for a couple of nights...
in a cell.
You have beds in the cells, right?
I could sleep here.
And I would understand,
just while you investigated the case,
until you've fully ascertained
that it was an accident,
and that I'm no longer a suspect.
Why would we need to hold you
as a suspect?
I took a long time to call
the ambulance.
You were stunned,
you didn't know how to react,
nor what to do... that's normal.
Maybe she would still be alive
if I had called sooner.
It was a damaging blow.
She wouldn't have survived.
So you don't think I killed her?
It's not your fault.
Don't beat yourself up.
Would you excuse me for a second?
Sign here and we're done.
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Die in there, bastard.
Die in there.
Die!
Motherfucker.
That's him.
That doesn't look like him at all.
I'm telling you it is.
Look carefully.
Maybe in the eyes, but not much.
Yeah, man, look at his face.
- No, it doesn't look like him.
- Yes it does.
It looks nothing like him.
Not the lips, not the nose... nothing.
Of course it looks like him.
Hey, hey.
Will you give me that drawing back,
please?
Why should we?
It's mine, I drew it.
- Really?
- Well, you don't draw very well.
Shut up, Juan.
It's someone from the street, huh?
Maybe.
You see? I know who he is.
I've seen him a couple of times
walking around.
- That's not him.
- What do you know?
- Who do you think it is?
- That man that lives over there.
Where?
In that house over there,
number five.
His name is Martin, dummy.
Am I right?
What?
Yes, yes.
You're right.
- You see, I was right.
- Enough already.
Leave me alone.
Are you all right?
Claudia?
Yes.
Really?
Really.
It's just that when I get home
I think he's going to be here...
waiting for me...
with a birthday present,
as if nothing ever happened.
I'm just tired.
That police station wore me out.
Okay.
But we had to
if we're going to find him, right?
He's been gone for two days now.
Do you really think
they're going to find him?
Yeah, I hope so.
- They'll probably find him dead.
- Come on, Claudia.
Why should we fool ourselves, Bruno?
I've had an accident.
And if his blood glucose level falls,
He'll die. He'll die in two hours.
But Martin is an archeologist, right?
Has traveled a lot and knows how
to take care of himself.
- What is that chair doing here?
- I don't know.
What is this chair doing here?
- I didn't move it, Claudia.
- Me neither.
Bruno,
has Martin returned?
Martin?
Martin?
Martin?
He can't be in there,
it's always locked.
He had to have returned.
But why, Claudia?
Because the chair is in
a different spot.
Then why isn't he here?
Why did he leave again?
Why?
Why?
He's gone.
He took off and left me behind.
And me too.
You're not his paralyzed wife.
No, I'm his friend.
His friend.
He left me.
He's at your house.
He called you...
- Do you think I could do that?
- Yes.
Do you think I could hide
something like that from you
after everything I've done
these past few days?
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Look, Claudia, you're upset.
You need to rest.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Don't call me, I want to be alone.
You're not alone, Claudia.
DAY 5
Who's there?
Martin, is that you?
What's going?
Close, damn it!
Yes?
Bruno, come quick.
I think someone's in the house.
Yes, inside the house.
Come right now, please.
Come quickly.
In my bedroom.
Yes, I have the keys with me.
I'll throw them to you
from the window.
Hurry, please. Hurry.
Yes.
Claudia!
Bruno!
Here you go.
- Claudia!
- Yes, I'm coming.
Hang on, I'm opening the door.
Bruno!
What happened?
I don't know.
The lift started moving on its own...
and I thought...
I don't know what I was thinking.
- Horrible things, right?
- Yes.
It's okay. It's okay.
Settle down. Calm down.
Settle down, Claudia.
There's no one here to hurt you.
Okay.
You'll search the whole house, right?
Look behind the doors,
he could be hiding anywhere.
Let's both get out of here, okay?
Yes.
Yes.
It's over.
It's all over.
Yes.
You see? There's no one here.
Let's check out the motor on the lift.
Yeah, I'll call the technician.
Well, there's no one here.
We've searched everywhere.
Okay.
Sorry to have bothered you.
I've been a bit hysterical.
- Where does this door lead?
- To the basement.
- Yes, but no one could be in there.
- It's always locked.
My husband is the only one
who uses it for storage.
- Your husband?
- He's out of town.
He'll be back next week.
Right, Claudia?
Okay, well, thank you very much,
and sorry.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, thank you.
Thanks for coming.
I truly thought you were in danger.
Yeah, me too.
Claudia?
Who did you think was here?
- Who?
- Yes. Who?
- I don't know, a thief or some man...
- Martin?
Martin?
You thought it was Martin, right?
And that's why you were terrified.
What are you talking about?
Why would I be so terrified if the only thing
I want is for him to be back?
- Are you sure that's what you want?
- Of course.
Yes.
- I don't know.
- You're not okay.
You don't live with him.
No, of course not.
I'm just his friend.
Everything has changed...
ever since the accident.
Martin never...
he was never able to understand
what it really means
not to be able to use your legs.
My life with him.
Conversations that started
in one room...
and never ended...
because he'd go to another room:
unfinished sentences...
disapproval that never reached his ears,
because...
because he could vanish so easily
from a room and I couldn't.
You mean to say it's not just a feeling?
No, it's not just a feeling.
These last few weeks,
he's spent hours
locked in the basement
because he knows
I can't go down there.
And why?
To avoid being with me.
Maybe I am afraid of him after all.
So much that I even thought
he was digging my grave in the basement.
Hey, listen.
- You have another set of keys, right?
- Yes.
Okay, then I'll hang on to these.
- Just in case.
- Okay.
And tomorrow evening, if you like,
we'll celebrate your birthday.
- Okay?
- Bruno, that's not nece...
No. Yes, it's necessary.
Yes. What do you feel like doing?
- Anything.
- Anything?
Hop on a plane
and go far away from here.
How about dinner?
Not my apartment, though,
it's too small, too tiny.
It's barely fits one person.
Maybe a nice restaurant?
What do you think?
I think that's great.
But it has to be Japanese.
Absolutely.
- Good night.
- Good night.
See you tomorrow.
Bruno.
Yeah?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
DAY 6
Coming. I'm coming.
Hello?
Yes.
Did you make a reservation yet?
Come on, Bruno, tell me.
I'm decked out, eh?
I'll tell you.
Okay.
A red dress, cute and long.
You can tell me that
when you see me.
Will you be long?
Okay.
I'll be waiting, okay?
See you soon. Bye.
Claudia!
Congratulations.
...so Bruno was going
to take me to dinner.
And where's Martin?
He's working on
some excavations in Peru.
That's too bad,
I'm taking off next week.
I would have liked to have seen him
before I left.
What are you going to do?
Send him my regards.
I will.
- Excuse me.
- Sure.
You know you can't be in here,
nor walk around this house
as if it were yours.
I told you guys to use
the downstairs bathroom,
and not go snooping around upstairs.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother you.
Fine. Downstairs.
Yes, of course.
Hello, Claudia.
Hello.
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
- I couldn't get you anything.
- Don't worry.
But it won't happen again.
I promise.
Don't make promises
you can't keep.
We have all the time in the world
to keep them.
Yes... of course.
I hope to have more birthdays.
We'll celebrate it at a nice restaurant.
Or we could travel to a country
that you've always wanted to visit.
Whatever you'd like.
Okay.
You and I get along really well, huh?
Yeah, I think so.
Even though you're a bit noisier
than my ex.
- Oh, really?
- Really.
And a bit unorganized.
You shouldn't leave a wet towel
on the bed because it will get wet.
Of course.
Okay,
maybe I'm a bit anal...
and a bit jealous at times...
but I think those things are
unimportant in a relationship.
It could be shocking,
don't you think?
Yes.
See, I know what I'm saying.
Yes.
We'll see.
You like to listen to music
in the morning...
and red dresses...
and Japanese food...
and you like crime stories...
What do you think?
And as an architect, I thought
we could get rid of that wall...
and widen some of the doorways
so your wheelchair will fit.
You've gotten quiet all of a sudden.
What do you think?
Who are you?
Me?
How's it going?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Come on, let's say goodbye
to everyone.
Well, so, we're about
ready for bed.
Thank you.
Thanks for coming.
- Have a good evening.
- See you next time.
- Take care.
- Goodbye.
Bye. Good night.
Thanks.
Good night.
Hey, you...
it's time to go home, isn't it?
Is the party over?
Yeah, a little while ago.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Bruno?
- Yeah, I'm coming.
Oh, Bruno, what a party.
- Did you have fun?
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah?
I like seeing you happy, Claudia.
And to think that everyone
disappeared after the accident.
Yeah, but they all came.
Yeah they came.
- They came to see me in a wheelchair.
- Come on.
It's true... so they could
look down at me...
to see why I haven't killed myself...
or to imagine how I have an orgasm.
Don't be vulgar.
- You've never wondered about that?
- No.
- No?
- No.
You've never wondered if I could feel
anything from the waist down?
Well, yeah.
Yeah, maybe.
Yes, yes.
- Did you hear that?
- What? Yeah.
Where are you going?
I think someone's in the house.
Don't scare me.
- Don't move.
- I don't want to be alone.
Is someone there?
Damn it.
Shit.
Don't go down there, Bruno.
- Where's the light?
- Don't go down there, Bruno.
We'll just close the door
and that's it, okay?
- I'm going down either way.
- No, no wait.
Wait. You have to know something.
I just locked the door.
Do you understand?
I called him from up here...
and he didn't answer,
and I closed the door
so he couldn't get back in.
Then... I realized
that I could have locked him in...
and I didn't do anything.
But he wasn't inside.
He was never inside.
But he is now.
He is now, Bruno.
He can't come back now, Bruno,
please.
I don't want him to come back.
Come on, please.
He doesn't exist to me anymore,
do you understand?
Don't worry.
If he is in there... it's because
he has no reason to come out.
Of course.
- It could be an accident.
- Yeah, those things happen, right?
- Yeah, they do happen.
- Yes.
Accidents. That's what
we'll say, okay?
Yeah, a thief.
Martin?
Martin?
Martin?
It's me Bruno.
Martin?
Are you there, Martin?
Martin?
Listen, Martin.
Look out, Bruno!
What the...
What are you doing here?
What...
How is that possible?
It can't be.
I can't take it anymore.
You won't be able
to get out of here either.
You will die...
when I die.
You'll never be able
to get out of here...
my little one...
trapped...
inside of me.
