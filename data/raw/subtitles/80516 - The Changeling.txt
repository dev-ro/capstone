- We should have taken the Honda.
- Where would we have put the luggage?
- You're very strong.
- Keep pushing!
This is the last holiday I’m ever going on with you.
Where did you get all those muscles?
More, more, more! Don't quit now.
How much further?
It's only a couple of million more miles.
A couple of what?
A couple of million more miles.
Now right up here we're gonna stop.
Keep pushing, don't quit!
Mexico, next time.
- Hawaii is better.
- Yeah.
Hold it, hold it, hold it! That's good.
Now what you gonna do?
I'm gonna try and get us some...
- help.
- help.
- Come on, let's have a snowball fight!
- Oh no! No!
No!
Daddy! Daddy, come on!
Help me, Daddy!
Yes... Do you have the number for emergency road service?
Thank you, Stan.
lf you want a hand with anything,
just give me a shout, Mr. Russell.
I will, thanks.
Mr. Russell?
Daddy!
Catch!
Mr. Russell...
You know that this piece is going to Seattle too, Estancia?
Yes, sir.
Good.
At first, I have to admit I was in shock.
I just functioned automatically. I didn't feel anything.
Then one day it hit me:
Joanna and Kathy are gone.
I just kept walking around the apartment, saying over and over
"They're gone, they're gone..."
I guess I was half crazy.
Well, that was four months ago and...
what I've got to do now is start making demands on myself.
Your first class is next Monday.
I’ve set up a meeting for it tomorrow with some of the faculty
You'll remember lot of them.
Eleven okay for you?
That's fine, Robert, thanks. Thanks for everything you've done.
Ah, come on,
everyone's very excited about you being here.
A well-known alumnus and distinguished composer like yourself.
Says who?
Distinguished or not,
we're glad you came.
Okay, kids, keep it down.
Go to the kitchen and get yourselves some cookies.
By the way, how long are you planning to stay in the hotel.
There's plenty of room for you here, you know.
Oh no, thanks, Eva. I think...
I’m gonna find a house... to rent. I’ve got some things coming out.
What I need is a place I can lock myself in and pound away at the piano.
A place I can work.
I have a friend who works for the Historical Preservation Society.
They have old houses that I'm sure they rent.
- We'll see what she can come up with for you.
- Good.
- Mr. Russell?
- Yes.
Hello I’m Claire Norman.
Why don't you hop in and we'll drive up.
Fine.
- When was the house last occupied?
- Let's see... About 12 years ago.
It's been with the Historical Society for the past 12 years.
There we go.
There were plans at one time to turn it into some kind of a museum.
But I don't know, I guess the house was meant to be lived in.
Why hasn't it been lived in?
Well I've only been with the Society for a year now.
The impression I get is that they havn't tried very hard with this place.
Of course it does need a lot of work.
And there's some pieces here
that are just stored.
You'd have your pick of them.
You know, whatever you like.
Kitchen's in here.
What does it take to maintain a house of this size?
Oh, we have a man who looks after all this places: Mr. Tuttle.
And...
this is the music room.
This is really why I thought of you and this house.
The piano was left here when the society took over,
just too much trouble to move, really.
It must be in very bad shape.
What are the terms?
Sorry to disturb your composing.
That's alright, Mr Tuttle.
This has already been composed.
There's a man at the front... wants to deliver a water-storage tank.
Says you called him.
Okay.
Manage to do any writing?
Yes, I’m still working on the second movement. Same old problem.
Well, maybe the lectures will help...
Get some new ideas.
It’s my understanding...
that there are...
23 students registered...
for this series of lectures on advanced musical form.
Now we all know that it’s not raining outside.
And unless there's a fire in some other
part of the building we wouldn't know about,
there's an awful lot of people here with nothing better to do.
However,
we'll know more after the second lecture.
I’m sure there are many of you
who may recognize this.
- It sounds a little bit better with an orchestra than with a piano.
- Oh no, you made it sound fine in class.
John's secret is that he's a natural ham.
Ah, you're going too far.
- lf you can't find your way back ...
- Send out a search party.
I'm sorry.
Hi!
I'd like you to meet my mother.
- How do you do, Mrs. Norman?
- How do you do?
This is John Russell. You remember the Chessman House?
Oh, oh yes, yes. I’m very pleased to meet you, Mr... Russel.
How are you liking the place?
Fine.
It’s so... large.
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention please?
I’d like to introduce Senator Joseph Carmichael
-  and his son:
- My God!
- congressman Eugene Carmichael.
- He's going to make another speech.
Oh yeah, hearing this lifelong Republican commenting on a Democrat.
You know how I hate making speeches.
But sometimes, on a very special occasion,
like raising money for our magnificent Symphony Orchestra...
And weren't they fantastic tonight?
Damn right!
Now I’m just going to get a drink.
I think I'll join you.
I'll be right back, mother.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Actually, he's on our Board of Directors,
at the Historical Preservation Society.
In fact he's become our number one philanthropist.
So, you're getting settled in then?
- Oh yes.
- Good.
There's some things at the Society office that belong to your house.
I'll see if I can dig them up for you.
I’m glad you took the house.
Mr. Tuttle?
Mr. Tuttle?
Yes, Mr. Russell.
You frightened me.
Is anyone else here? Mrs Riss in cleaning today?
No, sir. Just me.
Okay.
That's lovely.
The music.
- Hello!
- Hi!
It has the quality of a lullaby.
Yes it is, in a certain way.
Well, here we are, as promised.
These are some assorted prints that used to hang in the house.
And this...
is an old, restored photograph taken from the back of the house.
Beautiful.
I tried to call you first, but information can't give your number out yet.
That's a beautiful piece.
Did you refinish it?
I didn't, no.
That was Kathy's, my daughter.
Well I guess I’d better be off.
I hope you like the prints.
Thank you.
Are you going riding?
Yes.
Do you ride?
John?
What's the matter?
I was just thinking about my daughter Kathy.
How much she loved horses.
An airlock, somewhere.
It was too loud, too rhythmic.
Well, it's starting at least.
Why would it happen two mornings in a row,
precisely at 6 o'clock?
Why does it go on for about half a minute and then stops dead.
It doesn't make sense.
A furnace is like anything else, Mr Russell.
It’s got habits.
It’s an old house.
It makes noises.
Very good.
We're still not together on the off-beats.
And Don, you're retarding a little too much...
on the last four bars.
Otherwise it was splendid.
Good night.
What I'm driving at is...
Has... anything like this happened in the house before?
If so, to whom, when and...
what did they do about it ?
Since I’ve been with the Society, the house has been empty.
John...
You're working very hard.
You've been through a terrible emotional strain.
- Isn't it possible that you have...
- ...hallucinated. Is that what you're gonna say?
Excuse me.
Minnie ?
Claire, there's a call for you. Your mother. Should I tell her you're busy?
I'll be right there. Excuse me, John, just for a minute.
You know, there's some questions about your lease, Mr. Russell.
What do you mean?
That house shouldn't have been rented.
Miss Norman rushed the papers through our attorney's office.
She did not use proper channels.
Why should anyone object?
That house is not fit to live in.
No one has been able to live in it.
It doesn't want people.
Then there has been trouble in the house before.
Claire, listen. It’s note for note.
Same tempo and even the same key.
What do you think?
I don't know.
It’s a startling coincidence.
But that melody must have been very popular at one time,
or it wouldn't be on a music box.
I agree, but I swear I never heard it
before I played it and recorded it that day you came over.
No, there's something!
Something.
It’s happened before here. I’m not the first.
I went all over the files very carefully.
All the way back to 1920.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
Miss Huxley...
Minnie's a highly eccentric old woman, but she'd never...
She said the house didn't want people. She's mistaken.
Whatever it is... it's trying desperately to communicate.
The banging, the water taps,
the broken window panes. All the glass fell outward.
It has to be done from the inside.
Everything that's happened
has been designed to get me into that attic room.
I want to see it.
Look at that book on the desk.
C.S.B.
January 4th
1909.
It’s a little child's writing.
1909. Who could have lived here then?
This is where I found the music box on the mantel.
Look at this wheelchair.
My God!
It’s so small.
What was this room?
Former residents, William Saracino and family, architect.
Bought the place in 1965, sold it in 1967.
Purchased for the Society of Historical Preservation, November 1967,
through a generous grant from the Carmichael Foundation.
- That's the senator?
- Yes.
Great philantropist.
Now where is the rest of this file?
No previous occupants...
No previous acts listed.
There's nothing here before 1920.
Minnie, we're looking for the Chessman House file pre-1920.
Do you know where it is?
What is it you want to know?
We're trying to find out who lived in the house in 1909.
A man named Barnard. A doctor.
Did he have any children you know?
I believe a son and a daughter.
There was some kind of family tragedy, I think.
He sold the house in 1909.
- 1909?
- That's right.
- I'll set it up for you.
- Thanks.
It’s all ready to go. And the scanner's on the right.
Thank you so much.
Let's have a look here.
February 9th. These are want ads.
Financial page.
Real estate. More want ads.
Wait, wait, wait.
"Cora Barnard, seven-year old, daughter of Dr. Walter Barnard,
"prominent Seattle physician, was struck"
"and seriously injured when she ran in front of a passing coal cart"
"outside her Chessman Park home yesterday."
"She was hastened to St Margaret's Hospital where her condition remains grave."
So forth and so on ...
Cora Bernard...
C.S.B.
There.
"Cora Steward Barnard..."
"succumbed"
"in St Margaret's Hospital to injuries sustained in a February 15th accident."
"She is mourned by her parents"
"Miss Barnard will be interred in the family plot,"
"in the Pootfield Cemetary."
There's the doctor...
and his wife.
There's the brother, Lloyd.
This little girl, Cora,
was killed in the street.
It was an accident, almost the same as Kathy.
What is in that house, Claire?
What is it doing? Why is it trying to reach me?
John...
Is it because of my daughter?
I can't go through all this again.
John...
You must get out of that house.
Oh, I believe everything you're saying, Mr Russell.
The noises, the lights, the teleportation of objects. They're all very familiar.
- Fascinating stuff.
- But the point is:
What do I do now? I mean...
Ah!
I'll tell you,
off the record.
We have coming here
many... mediums and spiritualists and so,
and we test them.
Now...
99 percent...
utter frauds.
But...
the one percent...
astonishing!
A medium...
Hello.
Mr. Russell?
Yes.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
My wife, Leah.
It's just to your left, please.
Could we have these... lights off, please?
I thought I'd... record what happens. Is that alright?
Oh yes, yes, of course.
That's fine. Now, Mr. Russell, would you sit there, please?
Yes, of course.
And I'll sit here.
Thank you.
You've suffered a cruel loss, John Russell.
You've lost a wife and child.
The presence in this house is reaching out to you through... that loss.
The presence is very strong here.
It is a child's presence.
A child who is not at peace...
who cannot rest.
The presence...
is with us.
We sense that you are with us.
Will you talk to us?
Will you communicate with us?
Will you come through to us?
Will you speak...
to us?
We are here to help you.
What is your name?
Will you speak to us?
Yes.
What is your name?
Are you the child Cora?
Are you the child killed by the coal cart?
No.
What is your name?
Joseph.
Did you die in this house, Joseph?
How did you die?
Is there someone here you wish to communicate with?
John.
Help.
Help!
Help!
Help!
John!
Help!
Help!!!
Help!!!
Mr. Russell, will you sit over here, please?
Will you speak to John?
Will you tell us why you are not at rest?
Speak to John.
John is with us.
What do you want of John?
Why do you feel no peace?
Why do you remain in this house, Joseph?
What is in this house?
Speak to John.
John is with us.
How did you die?
Did you die in this house?
Why do you remain in this house, Joseph?
How did you die?
Joseph, did you die in this house?
"We are here to help you."
"What is your name?"
"...killed by the coal cart?"
No
"No."
"Are you the child killed by the coal cart?"
No
"No."
"Are you the child killed by the coal cart?"
No
"No."
"We are here to help you."
"What is your name?"
Joseph.
"What is your name?"
Joseph.
"What is your name?"
Joseph.
Joseph.
Joseph
"Joseph."
"Did you die in this house, Joseph?"
House...
My room...
Can't... walk.
"Will you tell us why you are not at rest?"
My father...
"Joseph, did you die in this house?"
My room...
"How did you die?"
"How did you die?"
How did you die?
How did you die?
Father...
Father...
The well...
Sacred Heart.
My medal.
Father...
Father, don't.
Help!
Body...
Ranch...
The well.
My name...
Joseph Carmichael.
Claire...
Yeah.
I’m sorry to...
I just...
Can you co...
Father...
My room...
Can't... walk.
"Will you tell us why you are not at rest?"
My father...
"Joseph, did you die in this house?"
My room...
"How did you die?"
Father, don't.
My name...
Joseph Carmichael.
I shouldn't have called you. It's just that I needed someone.
I wrote some words on the paper.
I wrote Sacred Heart.
There used to be a county orphanage...
named Sacred Heart.
It was closed down years ago.
An orphanage?
Yes.
That child, Joseph Carmichael...
He was murdered in this house, in the attic.
And buried.
And then an orphan...
Stop it, John! Just move away from this place.
Miss Huxley is on the phone, Senator.
It's the third time she's called this morning.
She says it's important.
All right, I'll take it.
Hello, Minnie, how are you?
I'm fine.
They've been going through the files.
Let me have that name again.
John...
Russell.
I’m very glad to be of help, as you know.
Goodbye.
The senator's campaign bio. 1960.
I got it from the main library and had it xeroxed. It's informing.
You found something?
Some kind of a rough retrospective, that somebody drew up
when they were thinking about turning the house into a museum.
Richard Carmichael and family occupied the house 1899 to 1906.
Richard was the senator's father.
His mother died when he was born in 1900.
It's all in there.
Look at the part about his illness.
"Joe Carmichael, his son, age three, was struck on of a form of atrophic arthritis."
Move further down.
"It was decided to send little Joe to the famed Nordbach
Sanatorium in Bale, Switzerland for special care."
"Accompanied by his father, he embarked for Europe in October 1906."
"And not to set foot on American soil again until the cessation of World War I."
You see how it might have been done.
Richard's son, a sick child,
was murdered by his father and buried secretly.
And then they substituted a six-year old orphan
who was put in his place and shipped right overseas right away,
with the father attending.
It all worked for them.
Even the war worked.
He kept him in Switzerland till 1918. He came back here, he was 18 years old.
Who was gonna know that he wasn't the real son?
If he wasn't crippled anymore it was because he was cured.
John...
Do you think he knows about the murder?
And about the replacement?
I don't know.
How could any father do such a thing?
Richard's wife was Emily Spencer.
She was the daughter of H.T. Spencer.
He founded the Spencer-Carmichael empire.
He died in... 1905. He was a zillionaire.
His will...
His will might be very interesting.
There must be a copy within the holo-write.
I'm also gonna try to find out if there was ranch.
A Spencer or a Carmichael ranch, somewhere.
Yeah, a ranch...
with a well.
This is the 1908 atlas of Seattle which is opened to the
part of the city where the Carmichael ranch was located.
Right here.
What does that little mark right there mean?
According to the legend, here,
that was the location of a well on that property.
I see...
And in the 1914 atlas,
which is opened here, to the same area,
there's been... one large lot that appears to have been sold off.
But the property is very much the same, and the location of the well is still given.
Right... I see.
In the 1928 atlas, there's a quite change.
There's further subdivision of the property.
The symbol for the well has disappeared,
and a house has been built here.
The ranch is listed in the will.
It’s part of the inheritance of little Joseph Carmichael.
All of five years old at the time.
He got just about everything.
What about the father, Richard?
Bypassed.
Except as his son's guardian and therefore trustee of the estate.
Old man Spencer's daughter was dead,
and obviously he wasn't too fond of his son-in-law.
Yes, but wait...
Richard doesn't get any money.
But he still controls his son and his son is worth a fortune.
Unless...
Unless for some reason the boy dies before attaining the age of 21.
In that case the entire estate goes to charity.
That would have shut Richard out completely.
And there he was with a son who was weak, sickly, bedridden...
Couldn't even walk.
He must have decided not to take a chance on the boy.
The money was just too tempting.
What are you going to tell her?
About the well under the house and the body.
And the medal with the name on it?
No, and nothing about Carmichael.
She'll think you're crazy.
You'll tell her I’m not.
Good evening, Mrs. Grey. I’m John Russell. This is Miss Norman.
Mr Russell...
I wouldn't have listened to your story for two minutes.
I wouldn't have let you in here...
but for something you said on the phone earlier.
You said that this...
seance affair of yours happened three nights ago, right?
That's right.
Well, three nights ago,
on Monday night,
Linda, my daughter,
woke up screaming just after midnight.
She'd had a nightmare.
When I went in to her, she was hysterical. She was sobbing.
I’d never seen her like that before.
I admit she's had nightmares before, but not ...
She said she'd seen... a boy.
Very small, very thin...
Almost gnome-like.
And he was trying to come up through the floor.
And he kept staring at her.
Here, in the middle.
She hasn't been in the room since, or come near. She sleeps with me.
What we want is...
What you want, Mr Russell, is to tear this room apart.
Well, I have your phone number, Mr Russell. I'll have to think about it.
They're still digging,
but they've found the well.
Okay.
Found anything?
No, nothing yet. This is Tony, Mrs. Grey's son. Miss Norman.
Hi!
Thanks.
Get me the flashlight, will you?
Sure.
I think I’ve found something.
What is it?
It’s a hand.
What?
It’s a hand.
I'll call the police.
Nothing more?
It doesn't look like it.
You think there might be something else coming?
No.
Assistant coroner said those bones have been down there maybe 50 years.
Do you have some idea who that child was?
No, not really.
What's "not really" mean?
No.
I want statements from everybody.
Mrs Grey, do you have some other place you could stay for tonight?
Yes, it's all been arranged.
Good.
I think you should have told them.
It’s got to be there.
Without that medal, there's no evidence. There's nothing.
You have the tape.
Tapes can be altered. They know that. You see the expression on his face?
It was obvious you were holding something back.
Look, it’s very late. Why don't you get some rest and I'll talk to you in the morning.
- Fine. Drive carefully.
- You too.
What's the matter?
St. Paul's Church. September 8th, 1900.
Joseph Patrick Carmichael.
It was there?
It was there.
You have to show it to the police.
It’s the only piece of solid evidence we've got.
They didn't see me dig it up. They couldn't find it.
Why should they believe it was there?
You can't just ignore them.
The police ain't gonna trouble themselves with a 70 years old case.
Still, it's an unsolved murder.
No.
Whatever has to be done, has to be done by me.
I’ve got to get to Carmichael.
He won't see you now.
He'll see me.
Senator!
Hey, hold up!
- Senator!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute now!
Senator!
I’m John Russell.
I'm living in your house.
Senator, look!
I want to show him that.
Let go!
Senator!
It’s a baptism medal.
It's got your name on it.
- You've got him?
- We've got him.
It was buried with the body...
of a little boy.
Senator!
The police know about it.
Who was that? Some kind of crackpot?
I have no idea...
Never mind. Come on!
Dale...
I want you to radio back to... police headquarters.
Captain DeWitt.
Ask him to call me in Spokane...
- this number.
- Yes, sir.
You goddamn son of a bitch.
What is it you want?
What do you want from me?
I’ve done everything I could do.
There's nothing more to do.
Mr. Russell?
Yes.
My name is DeWitt. Captain DeWitt.
Oh yeah.
I’d like to talk to you if I may.
All right. Come in.
Quite a house.
Yes.
You're a musician, a composer. Is that right, Mr Russell?
Yes.
You teach in a course of the Faculty of Music out of the university?
That's right.
Is this where you held your... seance?
What was it you wanted to talk to me about?
You were out at Boeing airfield this morning, Mr Russell.
They told me you caused quite a scene.
Screaming, yelling, acting like a lunatic.
Sgt. Durban tells me you were up to some strange things last night, too.
Seems you dug up some bones under a lady's house that...
some ghostly voice told you were there. Is that correct?
Only Sgt. Durban said you told him you had no idea...
who those bones were. No idea at all.
Now it seems...
Well, it seems a little odd then, don't you think,
that you go charging across that airfield this morning,
making crazy accusations against Senator Carmichael.
I made no accusation.
- Senator Carmichael who has served this state for 36 years.
- I told you...
And who is not about to give in to any dirty little blackmail scheme.
- Blackmail?
- You heard me.
What are you talking about?
I understand you lost your wife and daughter a little while ago.
Maybe it shook you up.
Maybe too much.
Maybe you need help.
I’d like you to leave now.
We can see that you get it.
You understand what I’m saying?
Out. Now.
Listen to me, Russell.
You've got something of the Senator's.
He wants it back.
It’s a little gold medal. A family heirloom. He lost it.
He thinks you've got it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I’m sorry to barge in on you like this, but I am so damn mad!
This mor...
This is... Cpt. DeWitt. He's with the police.
You're... Miss Norman?
Yes.
I take it now or I come back in an hour with
a warrant and a crew and we tear this place apart.
Tear this place apart? What's going on here?
I'll be here.
Suit yourself.
Well, what was that all about?
Senator Carmichael thinks he's being blackmailed.
They've cancelled your lease.
They've forced me to resign from the Society.
No explanation, no reason, nothing. Just get out.
I've an appointment with the head of the Board of Directors.
I'll see what I can find out.
I'll call you and let you know.
Yes?
Yes, Claire.
I was driving by and I recognized the car.
I don't know how it happened. I don't know how it could've happened.
There were no other car there. Nothing.
And it's upside down in the middle of the road.
And that man, that policeman who was just at your house, DeWitt, he's dead!
Carmichael. Any messages?
Oh yeah, Cpt. DeWitt. What did he say?
What?
Yeah.
Oh my God!
Who?
Russell?
All right.
Let me have that number.
John Russell.
The Senator is expecting you.
- Still busy?
- Yes.
Where are you going?
I'll be back in a little while.
Claire!
Alright, just what the hell do you want?
You must have some idea, otherwise I wouldn't have got past the door.
I’m a busy man. Make it fast.
The house on Chessman Park.
Your family lived there until 1906.
It’s had a history of...
strange happenings.
There's something... in that house, a manifestation.
This afternoon, Cpt. DeWitt came to see me,
presumably on your behalf.
So, you must have learned what's happened.
At least as much as DeWitt could tell you.
The... disturbances, the seance, the bones...
found in the well.
I tried to talk to you at the airport.
I showed you this.
DeWitt said you'd lost it.
I found it in a grave...
where the child was buried.
There's no... logical explanation for what I’m going to say to you now.
The boy was badly crippled.
I believe he was killed...
in an attic room of that house.
I...
I saw what happened.
And I believe it was Richard Carmichael, your father,
who murdered the boy, his natural son...
Joseph Carmichael.
There was a... substitution from the Sacred Heart orphanage,
the boy was taken to Europe,
cured, miraculously, and returned...
to inherit an empire.
That changeling was you.
So...
That's your story?
Whatever you want to call it.
How much?
My God!
Alright, how much do you want for this farce that you've concocted?
This isn't blackmail.
I’ve been dealing with vermin like you for years.
You waste your chance...
- then you come up with a story that's so pathetically incredible...
- It truly terrifies you, doesn't it?
- It’s the truth. It won't be buried.
- Get out!
None of this belongs to you!
Get out of here! With your filthy lies!
It should've gone to that dead child.
You suspected something was wrong all your life.
You're not Joseph Carmichael.
You're the beneficiary of the cruelest kind of murder.
- Murder for profit.
- No!
My father was not a murderer.
Nobody in this world can say that.
My father was a great man.
He was a loving man.
And for you to...
to come in here and accuse him of...
... of killing.
Damn you!
I will not allow you to slander his good name.
These documents are on file... in the city.
This is a tape of the seance.
There's no copy.
Take it. I’ve done what I had to do.
I’m sorry.
Russell...
lf I find that you've breathed one word of this...
One word...
To anyone ...
You'll wish you'd never come into this world.
What was that shouting about?
Nothing.
Get out!
Leave me alone.
John?
I tried to ca...
John?
John?
Where are you?
Claire!
John, what are you doing?
John?
Claire!
John?
please...
I don't want to come up there.
Claire?
John?
John?
I thought that you... Oh God! I thought you were here.
l thought you were here. l didn't know you were going out.
You're OK now. Come on.
Just wait in the car.
Oh no! You're not going back in there!
- No please, please! Don't!
- Claire!
Claire! You're safe now. Just wait in the car.
I'll be right back. Don't worry.
Joseph!
No!
Father...
My medal...
My medal...
Father...
Father...
My medal...
My medal!
John!
John!
Father...
Father, don't...
Help!
