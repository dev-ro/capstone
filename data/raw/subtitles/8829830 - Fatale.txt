DERRICK: I was always
the smart one.
The one who played to win.
I was damn good at it.
I was the best.
But then I took my eye
off the ball,
and just like that,
the rules of the game changed.
I was no longer playing
to win.
This was a new game.
I'm playing for my life now.

- It's a nice sweater.
- (LAUGHS)
RAFE: And she talked me
into it. She talked me...
Well, at least she knows
what looks good on you.
Thank you. Thank you.
I told ya.
RAFE: Yeah,
she's something else.
(DERRICK TYPING INTO PHONE)
Come on, man.
Look, D, we are trying
to have a good time.
- Will you please... All right?
- Sorry. Sorry.
You're right.
Absolutely right.
RAFE: We're having fun, man.
Relax.
DERRICK: We're done.
We're done.
You see what I'm dealing with?

TRACIE: Anyway, hon, he has
told us nothing about you.
What do you do?
How'd you two meet?
Interesting story.
We met in an art gallery.
(LAUGHS) Wait, do you know
what an art gallery is?
DERRICK: You went to
an art gallery?
- RAFE: Well...
- To buy art?
- Rafe, you liar.
- No, no.
Hey, I want to make a toast.
To everything we've built.
To everything we've built.
Yeah, no.
To us, and everything
that we've built.
How about I propose a toast
to, uh, everyone
and everything
that we all have built.
- MICAELA: (APPROVINGLY) Mmm.
- Touche.
(GLASSES CLINK)
To billions of dollars, right?
RAFE: (LAUGHS) Or millions
of dollars, I like that, too.
- MICAELA: I knew you'd...
- My baby's got to...
- RAFE: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Oh, my God, Rafe!
- RAFE: My bad, my bad.
- Here we go. I've got it.
RAFE: You know what?
- Wait, this expensive...

TRACIE: What time is it?
3:00.
Shit.
I have a house to show
in Hancock Park,
and I'm running late.
Yeah. Speaking of late, uh...
A couple of nights ago,
you got home,
you got in after midnight.
Yeah. The buyers took forever
to close the deal,
and then they wanted to go out
and celebrate.
What'd you want me to say?
"No"?
You know how many nights
I stayed home
while you were out on the town
with your clients,
building your career?
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
You remind me all the time,
but that career has provided
the lifestyle that we love.
TRACIE: How many times do we
have to go through this, Derrick?
I wanted my own career,
not yours.
Now I finally have one,
and you want me to give it up.
I never asked you
to stop working.
I just want to know
where you were.
Can we fight later?
I just want to spend time
with my wife.
I don't need to go to Vegas.
I'll cancel the trip.
I'll stay right here.
Just go to Vegas
with your buddies.
I don't care.

So, talk to me.
It's... It's Tracie.
What about her?
I just... I've been having

I don't know.
I think she might be seeing
somebody else.
It's crazy, right?
Why?
You seein' signs?
Mm-mmm... No. It's not that.
It's...
It's like when
we first got married,
we were the perfect couple.
And now we're like
two strangers
in the same house.
Look, man...
it's not your fault.
You're a great husband.
And what you're experiencing
right now
is called seven years
of marriage.
- Okay.
- But luckily, there is a cure.
What?
- Gimme your left hand.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
RAFE: Come on,
give me the ring.
Come on. Fuck! Shit, dawg.
Give it... Give me the ring,
please?
No. Uh-uh.
This ring represents marriage.
And right now,
you ain't in one.
We at a bachelor party
with an emphasis
on "bachelor."
For the next 24 hours,
you are a single man.
- I didn't come here for this.
- Just...
(LAUGHS) Shit, man.

- It's Vegas.

It brings out the predators.

It's hot in here, ain't it?
Is that the best you can do?

I have a... a high-stress job

I come to Vegas,

I highly recommend it.
Do I look stressed?
Actually, you do.
I am.

Um... I can't find my phone.
Oh.
It's in the room safe.
What?
I put it in there in case
you tried to sneak away.
(CHUCKLES) Okay.
Well, just give me...
Give me the combination.
Hmm.
I forgot it.
Seriously?
You're kidding, right?
Nope.
Look, I... I... You know,
got to get to McCarran,
so I don't have the time
to play games. So...
(CHUCKLES) Well, then you
shouldn't have come to Vegas.
Yeah. Just give me
the code, please.
Well, then you'd leave.
Yeah, that's the general idea.
Well, what if I'm not done

Wait, what do you mean,
"Not done with me"?
I'm gonna need more.

I'm Tyrin,
I'm Derrick's cousin.
Oh, well, Mr. Tyler's

Never mind, I see him.
What's up, boy?
How you doin'?
DERRICK: It fits the, um...
It's, um...
So that's my cousin.
Um, at the end of the day,
I think all of our clients
will testify that we,
you know...
We have the best style
of brand management.
Damn, that'll be
an awesome plan, Derrick.
- All right. All right.
- Smart man.
You guys are rising stars.
I guess, let's rise,
let's rise together, man.
- All right?
- Thank you, man. Thank you.
- DERRICK: You're welcome.
- Thank you.
My receptionist told me there
was an intruder in my office.
Oh. No-look pass.
- Oh.
- Did you see Lance?
I just closed a big
energy drink deal with him.
What? Did he LeBron you?
What?
Did he whisper in your ear?
Man, get the fuck out.
- (LAUGHS)
- Come on.
Nah, D-man,
I don't know if I ever
told you, man, but...
- Proud of you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
I got to talk to you.
- What's up?
- Mom called yesterday.
She said she hasn't seen you
in two weeks.
I came to get this money
from you,
then I'm going to check
on Moms. I got you.
I know why you're here,
all right?
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.
You didn't think
I would catch that, huh?
- DERRICK: I knew you had it.
- (CHUCKLES)
All right.
All right.
So, this money comes
with strings.
Strings?
(SIGHS)
Call Mom. She worries.
I got you.
Promise?
- I'm gonna go see her.
- All right,
look, good to see you.
- Love you, boy.
- You too, man.
All right. Come by the house
some time, all right?
Come on, man. You know your
wife ain't messing with me.
She ain't really messing with
me much these days either.
Trouble in paradise?
I'll fix it.
Fix it, okay?
We don't need her taking half
our Lance Stephenson deal.
- We need that.
- Gotcha.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Yo, yo, yo.
What up? What up?
I see some cash. (CHUCKLES)
Let me guess.
Another amazing

You know what?
I love the skinny

(LAUGHS) Up high.
Come on, dawg.
Come on,
I give you a boost, huh?
Come on.
I'm messing with you,
man, come on.
Give us a minute
so we can have some

(CHUCKLES)
TYRIN: Incredible, man.
RAFE: I'm just fucking

TYRIN: Watch yourself.
Short-ass motherfucker.
I can't believe they still make
short motherfuckers like that.
Damn.
Yo, why you still
giving Tyrin money, man?
That's family.
(SCOFFS) Okay. Family.
Well, why don't you mail him
a check?
'Cause every time
he brings his raggedy ass
around here,
it's bad for business.
Hey, easy, easy, Rafe,
all right?
Tyrin, he's...
He's off limits, okay?
He's off limits. Okay.
You do you.
Uh, let's talk WME.
(HESITATES)
What's there to talk about?
Dude, Tim Perkins
is breathing down my neck
day and night, dawg.
Dude, he's fucking serious.
He is legit
about buying this agency.
Derrick, we just signed
Lance Stephenson, man.
One more piece of the puzzle.
We got a stable of athletes.
If WME acquires us,
that is worth millions, dawg.
We'd be a part of
a global empire.
We started this agency
because we didn't wanna work
for anyone else.
We built this.
It's ours.
We work for us.
Not a monolith.
We should at least
consider the deal.
Just hear them out.
I know exactly
what you're saying,
but we both got to agree
to sell,
and I don't agree.
All right. I trust you, man.
Let me just leave you
with this, though.
We started out small, man.
A small black company.
Look at us.
They want us.
You did that, all right?
Take it seriously.
That offer, that will not be
on the table forever.
Just... Just sayin',
all right?
Lance Stephenson...
you did that.
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING

Derrick?
Hey. Hey.
Hey, you're home early.
Okay.
Um, hope you brought
your appetite.
You're cooking?
Come here,
I want you to taste this.
DERRICK: Mmm-hmm.
What do you think?
Tell me the truth.
- It's good.
- It's good?
- It's good.
- Great, great, great.
The rest should be ready
pretty soon.
You haven't done this
since we started dating.
Yeah, I know. That's, um...
That's the idea.
This is a date?
Why not?
I kind of miss those days.
We could get it back.
Am I being punked?
Anyone seen my husband?
DERRICK: I deserve that.
Oh, Tracie,
something I want to tell you.
Look, I've given myself
a wakeup call.
We've been going
in different directions,
and I want to get
on the same path.
So maybe...
we should settle down...
raise a family.
A girl for you.
(CHUCKLES)
Maybe a boy for me.
Okay, Babyface. (LAUGHS)
What? What...
You remember that one?
Well... (LAUGHING)
Those are definitely

Mr. and Mrs. Tyler,
I'm Detective Valerie Quinlan.
I'm sure this was
a very terrifying ordeal
for you guys tonight.
Your first name,
is it Derrick or Darren?
It's Derrick.
Derrick.
I understand that you came
face to face
with the intruder?
Um... I didn't see his face.
You know, he was choking me,
he fired a gun
a couple of times.
Have we met before?
Excuse me?
I'm certain
I know you from somewhere.
I don't think so.
VAL: Are you sure?
I'm certain I know you
from somewhere.
My husband was
a college basketball star.
He represents
a lot of sports figures,
so he gets interviewed
on TV a lot.
Oh. On TV.
That's probably
where I've seen you.
And where were you,
Mrs. Tyler,
when this happened?
I was downstairs
in our bedroom.
Will you take me there,
please?
Sure.
No, you stay here.
I want to talk to your wife.
TRACIE: Right this way.
VAL: A very beautiful home
you have.
TRACIE: Thank you.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Right this way.
Thank you.
(INDISTINCT

Which side of the bed
do you sleep on?
I'm not sure how that question
pertains to the investigation?
It's all part of it.
I sleep on the right,
and my husband
sleeps on the left.
Mrs. Tyler,
can you think of anyone
who might want to harm you
or your husband?
Why? Wasn't this
just a robbery?
Well, maybe your husband
got there in time,
but in a robbery,
usually something gets stolen.
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
VAL: (ECHOING)
Mr. Tyler? Mr. Tyler.
Mr. Tyler, are you all right?
You seem nervous.
I'm sorry,
I'm just a little bit shaky.
That's understandable.
You've had
a big shock tonight.
Yes, I have.
And from what it looks like,
you fought back pretty hard.
A man was in my house
with a gun.
I would have killed him
if I had to.
(PAPERS RUSTLING)
Don't hesitate
to give me a call...
if you have any information
pertaining to
the investigation.
Thank you for your time.
I'll be in touch.

I'll handle it.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
You can't be here.
You know that.
What are you doing?
I'm not asking for custody.
I just want to be
a part of her life.
You lost the right
to be a part of her life.
(SCOFFS)
It was an accident.
It was drunken negligence.
I've been sober
since the accident.
She doesn't even know
who you are anymore.
Give me visitation rights,
please?
I've completely
cleaned up my life
and it's been
three years now. I'm...
In clear violation
of the restraining order.
It's a hundred yards, asshole.
That's as close as you're ever
going to get to her.
Now, let me make something
absolutely clear to you.
You are never going to be
her mother again.
If you come
anywhere near my family,
you'll have a lot more
to worry about
than a restraining order.

Okay. I think we should...
We should talk.
You have some new information
concerning the case?
- No.
- Then?
Well, I want to know
what's going on here.
What do you mean?
You're the victim of a crime.
I'm investigating the crime.
Right. Um...
What I want to know is,
what's happening with us?
You're afraid I'm going to
expose you to your wife?
Are you?
Think it through.
I expose you, you expose me.
Last thing I need
is for my colleagues to know
what I do in my private life.
Okay.
Um...
I just wanted
to make sure that,
you know, things are straight.
Um, I also wanted to apologize
and make it clear
that what happened...
Was the first time
you ever cheated on your wife.
I get it. You want me to know
you're a decent guy.
(DERRICK SIGHS)
Look, I have a marriage
to protect.
And Tracie and I are good now.
But not before?
Before?
In Vegas,
when you weren't wearing
your wedding ring
and your name
was Darren Johnson?
(SCOFFS) Have to say, you are
one very convincing liar.
- I thought...
- What?
I thought
we were playing a game.
- A game?
- A game.
Like, it's Vegas.
There's... You know,
what happens in Vegas...
A game.
I... I am... I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
You're sorry you got caught
in your own lies.
You know, our actions have
very serious repercussions,
especially when they damage
other people.
I never...
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Oh, shit.
Oh...
You deserved that.
So, let me tell you
what you want to hear.
Our time in Vegas
has no bearing on this case
or on my ability
to be professional.
I'm a decorated officer.
I've the best arrest
and conviction record
in the department.
And I will figure out
who broke into your house.
And in the meantime, I have to
advise you to be careful.
Why?
It might have been
an attempted hit.
A hit?
(SCOFFS) I, um...
Like someone's
trying to murder...
Okay. Um, I run a respectable
sports agency.
I deal with athletes.
I don't deal
with nefarious characters.
- Why would...
- I don't know.
It's for you to answer.
Maybe someone you screwed over
in a business deal?
A woman you screwed
and discarded?
Why don't you take some time
to think it over
and get back to me?
Otherwise,
I think we're done here.
Darren...
from Seattle.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

You remember
Detective Quinlan, right?
Am I interrupting something?
Any news regarding the case?
No, I just...
I wanted to see your place

Maybe find something
we might've missed
the first time.
You know,
what you see in the night
isn't always
what you see in the day.
TRACIE: Um...
I'm sorry, I need to go.
I have a house to show
down at the beach.
All right, well,
I think that I'm done here.
Uh, unless there's anything
you remember
that you want
to share with us?
No. No, I think I...
When I saw you here,
I thought you had
already caught the guy.
No, but we'll catch him.
You sure about that?
I don't go after something
unless I know I can get it.
Thank you for your time.
I'll see myself out.
Straight down.
DERRICK:
Well, what time, uh...

You know these clients.
Who knows, but I'll be late,
don't wait up.
Drive safe.

RAFE: (SIGHS) I hate to

You talked to Tyrin?
Are you trying to be funny?
He knows your house.
He knows the layout.
You know,
he could have been talking
with his low-life friends,
telling them about
his rich cousin. It's just...
Hey, hey, you...
Way, way off base.
Just...
Just leave Tyrin out of this.
(RAFE SIGHS)
And this lady cop,
she didn't say anything

No, I think
she just gets a kick

At your request,

You've been here before?
No.
Is there a reason
why I should have?
Okay, use this.
It's the fourth house
to the left,
check out the big room
at the top on the right,
just off the balcony.
What am I looking for here?
Keep watching.
It's, uh, my business partner.
I know.
(WAVES CRASHING)
(GASPS SOFTLY)
(WHISPERS)
What the fuck? What...
The house is a rental property
your wife handles.
How long?
Don't know.
You followed my wife.
(SIGHS)
That's why I was at your house
the other day.
I knew something was wrong.
So I decided to see
what she does with her day.
Fuck. Fuck!
Don't go back there.
All right, look,
you had your fun.
Leave me alone.
There's more.
Leave me the fuck alone!
You need to call me
when you're ready.
(CAR ENGINE REVVING)
(BRAKES SQUEAL)
Jesus.
Didn't you get the memo?
I mean, what the fuck
are you doing here?
Don't worry, Carter,
I know Haley's not here.
You're watching my house, Val?
You know, I'm done.
I'm done with you.
Look, I've asked my attorney
to petition the court.
I'm asking for custody
until your inquest is over,
and he thinks
I have a good shot.
If you really want to do
what's best for Haley,
you'll sign off on this, okay?
And that way, we can avoid
dragging her
through this hearing.
You really think
you'll get custody?
I mean, you really think
I'd let that happen?
You got to the judge,
didn't you?
I could get to anybody
in the city.
Your attorney knows it.
And the only one who doesn't
is you.
So, wake up, Val.
You're never getting
Haley back.
- No.
- No. No.
You're going to prison.
I'll get her back.
I'm not going anywhere.
Look,
this inquest is bullshit.
They can't take me down.
I'll take the rest of
City Hall down with me.
I know where all the bodies
are buried.
Look, if it's any consolation,
you were never going to win.
Game was rigged.
Now get the fuck out of my way
before I run you over.
- (CAR DOOR CLOSES)

VAL: Hi.
You said there was more.
(SIGHS)
Where do we meet?
I'll get you a glass for that.
I didn't take pleasure
in showing you that scene.
I just thought you should
see it for yourself.
I called you because you said
there was more.
Rafe Grimes was the one
who tried to kill you.
You got to be outta your mind.
They...
They tried to make it look like
a home invasion gone bad.
- They?
- Tracie.
They're in it together.
That... You know, that...
That sounds crazy.
How much is your agency worth?
If you die, what...
Tracie gets half that?
Rafe gets the rest?
No.
No, there's... Is there...
You're making this up,
there's no proof.
Why didn't she call 911?
When she heard the gunshots?
Why did she go upstairs
herself?
She wanted to...
She wanted to help me.
They're bad people, Derrick.
She's fucking
your best friend.
This is my job.
I know how this goes.
They're guilty, Derrick.
- It's okay.
- (DERRICK GRUNTS)
All right, I'll clean this up.
(THUDS)
You know, if they tried
to kill you once,
they'll try again.
You have to protect yourself.
- How?
- Well...
you could always
kill them first.
With how I'm feeling
right now, don't tempt me.
They tried to kill you.
- How does that make you feel?
- Angry.
Very fucking angry.
And what do you wanna do
about it?
What do you wanna do about it
right now?
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
(DERRICK PANTING)

CARTER: You really think
you'll get custody?
You really think
I'd let that happen?
You are never going to be
her mother.
VAL: You got to the judge,
didn't you?
CARTER: I can get to anybody
in the city.
DERRICK: I thought
we were playing a game.
VAL: A game?

You Derrick Tyler?
(INDISTINCT

Yeah. What's wrong?
You need to come with us,
Mr. Tyler.
Why?
I'm not at liberty
to say, sir.
Just grab a few things.
Come on with us.
(DOOR OPENS)
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
The fuck am I doing here?
My partners
will be here any minute.
If you want me to help you,
you gotta be honest with me.
Did you do it?
Did I do what?
What are you talking about?
Why... Why am I here?
Did you do it?
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.
(MUMBLES)
(GASPS SOFTLY)
Baby...
They're dead like you wanted.
I... I didn't...
No. I didn't...
I didn't do this.
I didn't. I didn't do this.
You left my place
three hours
before the murders took place.
That's plenty of time
to drive to the beach...
- I didn't... God, I didn't.
- ...and kill them.
I didn't kill my wife.
I didn't...
You know,
there's the...
matter of your...
buried past.
Arrest as a minor
for auto theft.
Breaking and entering.
There's even a charge here of...
armed robbery
with a deadly weapon.
Liquor store.
(HESITATING)
That charge was dropped.
Well, because your cousin...
Wait, let's see, um... Tyrin,
he came forward
and cut a deal,
took full responsibility.
And that, I think,
allowed you the ability
to get
a basketball scholarship
and get your ass
out of the projects.
Don't lie to me, Derrick.
I am not a murderer.
Just a businessman.
Just a ball player.
Practically a celebrity.
And celebrities don't
commit murders, right?
It was at the scene.
Hopefully, I can keep you
from getting indicted.
- I didn't do it.
- But I need you to tell me everything.
You went back there,
didn't you?
- I didn't.
- And don't you fucking lie.
- I didn't do it.
- Did you go back there or didn't you?
That's what I thought.
I had to know.
I, uh...
I had to see it
for myself. And...
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
RAFE: D...
I'm so sorry.
Just...
Don't act so surprised.
And then you did it.
You went back to your car,
got a gun.
You went back
to that bedroom...
and you killed them.
I didn't...
You got to believe me.
I didn't kill them.
I think we're done here.
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)
(REPORTERS CLAMORING

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)
LAWYER:
Well, I'll just say this.
I think this is just another
unfortunate example
of an African American male
being hung and burned
in the Lynch Court
of public opinion.
My client, Mr. Tyler,
has not even been given
a trial yet,
and yet he's being treated
as a criminal.
REPORTER: (ON TV)
That notwithstanding though,
these are two of the people
closest to him.
Is there any reasoning,
any alibi you could give us
as to why he isn't the one
we should be questioning?
I'm not really at liberty
to go into any of those
specifics right now,
but as I said, the evidence
will speak for itself,
and we're confident that, uh,
the record
will be set straight.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Tyler, we...
We didn't think
we'd see you this week.
Are Carrie and Patrick here?
Uh, no, no, they haven't been
coming in since the news.
Go home.
REPORTER 1: (ON TV) As we
told you before the break...
REPORTER 2: ...continue
as the city council
- responded to bribery...
- REPORTER 3: ...buries his wife, Tracie Tyler,
and the public fallout
from this shocking
double homicide continues.
Mr. Tyler's once-thriving
management company
is losing clients by the hour,
while the public openly
vilifies this grieving husband
who is yet to stand trial
or face criminal charges.
More on this to come.
Take Mom inside.
How was the funeral?
What do you want?
Can't I stop by to offer
my condolences for your loss?
(SIGHS) My family's here.
It's not a good time.
All right.
You should know you've gone
from person of interest
to prime suspect.
No.
No.
Yeah. They're gonna indict you
any day now.
I didn't do it!
DA doesn't care.
So, find the killer!
Well, that's complicated.
I mean, who's the real killer
in a situation like this?
The one who pulls the trigger
or the one that wants it done?
Oh, shit.
You killed them.
No one's gonna believe you.
You killed them.
Why?
You need
to get some rest, Derrick.
I'll be in touch.
No, you...
Hey, hey!
(DERRICK GRUNTS)
I could kill you right now
in self-defense.
Then all your problems
would be over.
Now, go back inside
and play the sad,
bereaving husband
of the wife who loved him
so much, she wanted him dead.
(ENGINE STARTS)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
How is she?
Mom is strong.
But she's not made of steel.
You know, she stopped going
to the church and the market.
Everywhere she go,
"Your son's a murderer."
All right. Thanks.
Hey, Mom.
Hi.
You are a good man.
We all know
you didn't do this.
I know you did not do this.
I never thought
in a million years
that I'll be having
this conversation with you.
(SIGHS) I'm here...
and I'll always be here
till the day I die.
This wasn't
a part of the plan.
You know, I worked hard.
I didn't...
I didn't take any shortcuts.
Now...
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.
(DERRICK'S MOM SCOFFS)
What do you mean,
you don't know?
You're gonna hold your head up.
You're gonna
put your shoulders back,
and you're gonna figure out
some kinda way to get it done.
What is the most precious
thing you own, Derrick?
Your name!
And they can't take it
from you
unless you give it away.
So, you gotta fight.
You gotta get up every day
and fight for it.
Do you know I love you so?
You just gotta fight.
- Yeah, Mom.
- Hmm.
- I love you.
- And I love you.
A man's name
is a precious thing.
Go clear your name, son.
DERRICK: I gotta be smarter
than her.
So, she's crazy and obsessed.
Yeah.
I don't know what she wants.
I don't know...
what her real motive is.
Leave it to me.
I don't wanna do that.
D, the cops
speak a different language.
You don't speak that no more.
I do. Look at you.
Got that Steph Curry eyes
(LAUGHS) with that
Jesus of Nazareth hair.
Come on, man.
(LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah, we came a long way,
didn't we?
TYRIN: Yeah.
I don't wanna go back.
I got to play this smarter.
You with me?
It's an absolute no
on this, please.
Can't tell me no.
Do you think I want you
to go back to prison?
I've got enough
on my conscience.
Just promise me you're gonna
leave this woman alone.
Can't promise you that.
(TYRIN BREATHES DEEPLY)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
- What's up, boy?
- What's up?
Your cousin Derrick,
know they got him boxed in.
They gonna come get him
real soon.
All over the news
every day, bro.
Got to handle my business,
you know?
That's all.
You got that?
Shit, if you need me to
ride along, let me know.
You know I'm with it.
Look, man... (SIGHS)
We're dealin'
with a dirty cop.
Shit could go bad, you know.
We gotta do what we gotta do.
I'm with you.
Let's ride.

Welcome home, bitch.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Derrick send you?
Derrick don't know I'm here.
You're the cousin. Tyrin.
- What do you want?
- TYRIN: You framed my cousin.
What I'm tryin'
to figure out is, why?
That's my cousin Bumpy.
You know, he hates cops
just as much as I do,
especially ones that
frame innocent black men.
You got the balls
to kill a cop?
Bitch, I will blow
your motherfucking brains out.
- Please. (CRIES)
- Please?
- Please what?
- VAL: Don't kill me.
What you playin' when you were
framing my fucking cousin?
BUMPY: Man, fuck this bitch.
Please. I got a daughter.
Why did you frame my cousin?
You gonna have a fuckin' hole
in your head
- if you don't start talkin'.
- (GUN COCKS)
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Stop stalling and give me some fuckin' answers, bitch!
BUMPY: Just kill
this bitch, man.

VAL: (SOBBING) Bathroom.

TYRIN: I need
this bitch to talk.
Man, take this bitch
to the bathroom, man.
Get your ass up.
Don't try
nothing stupid either.
(COUGHING)
No locked doors.
Stop playing with me.
Hurry the fuck up.
(VAL VOMITING)

Man, hurry up

Val?
(PHONE DISCONNECTS, BEEPS)
(SEAGULLS CALLING)
DERRICK: Where's Tyrin?
Is he dead?
It was self-defense.
- You killed him.
- Mmm-hmm.
They came at me,
and I put 'em down.
Fuck you.
(VAL GROANS)
Get down. Get down!
Give me the gun, Derrick,
before you do
something stupid.
Listen to me.
You fucking killed him.
Listen to me.
Tyrin's death
could be your ticket...
Down. Down.
Look, killing a cop,
it's only gonna make
your problems worse.
Think it through.
We can pin the murders
on Tyrin.
The fuck you talkin' about?
Your cousin.
He's an ex-con. Right?
With a history of violence.
He's the perfect candidate,
and he can't defend himself.
You want me
to frame my cousin?
He's a career criminal,
finds out his beloved cousin's
wife is cheating on him,
so he follows her to a
rendezvous with her boyfriend
and caps 'em both.
Then he figures out
I'm getting close,
so he comes to my place
to kill me.
I can sell that, Derrick.
Think about it.
What makes you think
I'm gonna go along with this?
'Cause it's your way out.
You should take it.
It gets you off the hook.
You're a fucking psychopath.
Maybe.
But you need me.
- So, give me the gun.
- No. No.
- Give me the gun.
- Just get over there.
- The gun...
- Don't... (GUNSHOTS)
See?
I knew you could kill.
- I just had to be sure.
- (GUN COCKS)
No blanks in this one.
Drop it.
(GUN THUDS)
I've already got
your wedding ring.
The murder weapon
with your prints
makes it a slam dunk.
You used me in Vegas,
now I'm gonna use you.
What do you want from me?
I did your murders.
Now you're gonna do mine.
You want me to kill someone?
Carter Heywood.
You know who he is?
Yeah.
Why?
He took something from me,
and I'm gonna get it back.
So, you ruined my life
so that I...
- Hey!
- ...could fix yours?
I don't need you
to understand.
Just fucking listen to me!
Carter, he leaves his house at
exactly 6:00 a.m. every morning
to go running.
His path takes him to the
Weisser Tunnel in Brookside
at exactly 6:15.
You're gonna be waiting at
the north end of the tunnel.
You're gonna kill him, and you're
gonna toss the gun in the storm drain.
If Carter isn't dead
by 6:15 a.m. tomorrow morning,
the weapon that killed
Tracie Tyler and Rafe Grimes
will be discovered.
And Derrick Tyler,
has-been athlete
and big-time sports agent,
will be convicted
of a double homicide
and spend the rest of his life in
prison, telling all the other cons
what it's like to hang out
with Shaq.
Do this, the gun goes away,
and I hang all the other murders on Tyrin.
And just like that,
Derrick gets his life back.
Stay at home tonight.
The gun to kill Carter
will be delivered.
Got it?
(SIREN BLARING IN DISTANCE)

Hey, Carter. Carter. Listen.

- Get back! Easy, easy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. All right. Take it easy, man.
Detective Valerie Quinlan,
right?
(STAMMERS)
She's your ex-wife?
(LOUDLY) Is she your ex-wife?
- Yeah.
- She killed my wife.
And she's framing me for it.
- She wants you dead, man.
- What?
She wants you dead,
but I've got a plan.
She sent you down here
to kill me?
- I got to make it look...
- Pull a gun on me? Fucker! (GRUNTING)

She's trying to frame me!
I need your help! No.

He's dead.
But you did your job.
I fucking hate you.
There it is.
Just like I promised.
Go ahead.
What are you waiting for?
- Take it and go.
- No.
No?
You're gonna kill me,
aren't you?
Why would I do that?
Because if I'm dead,
you get the accolades,
you solve the murders,
you get your daughter back.
No loose ends.
Just like you like it.
Then why are you here?
(CHUCKLES)
It's because I'm the only one
who can help you now.
Yeah.
You're pathetic.
I don't need you dead.
We're both clean.
You brutally murdered

And I'd keep on killing if it
meant getting my daughter back.
