Our Father...
Who art in heaven...
Hallowed be Thy name...
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done...
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day
our daily bread...
and lead us not into...
For you, Mendel, a ruble.
A real ruble.
You, Abram, get 75 kopeks.
Because you didn't' try today.
You only pretended to sing.
You tried to cheat me, eh?
And God as well!
Oh Poland if your people...
who now die for you had
got to work...
with handfuls of earth...
gathered from the homeland...
they could have built
a new country...
with their own hands.
I want to pawn this.
I'll take it.
41... 42... 43...
51... 52... 53...
320... 321... 322...
- How many?
- 400
- 628
- All right.
It's all ours!
I don't have anything and
neither do you.
I don't have anything either.
So together we have enough...
- to build a factory.
- So what's the decision?
We're building it.
Right here.
Let's do it!
Max, your cow is bellowing.
- Karol, your songbird's singing.
- I hope it chokes.
I'm a poor widow with children.
I've come to ask for help.
After that machine cut off my
husband's head...
I'll talk to our lawyer.
- What's new?
- Weber's bankrupt.
He'll have to negotiate.
- What are his losses?
- Depends on what they give him.
- Does Buchholtz know?
- He's not here yet.
Check the rate sheet, the
railroad overcharged us.
Tell the warehouse...
not to issue any goods to Frumkin,
he owes us too much.
They say he's going bust.
What did you tell that woman?
To find a lawyer and sue the
company for compensation.
What do you care?
I don't understand.
I care about injustice and
people's misery very much.
What's your job here?
A counting room trainee.
You may soon not be.
It's all the same to me.
But not to us, the factory.
You are only a cog here.
You're here to work, not
play philanthropist.
I'm not a machine,
I'm a human being.
Your humanity is not required
here in the factory.
You're a machine like the rest
of us so just do your job.
- Mr. Borowiecki...
- Mr. Von Horn!
Listen when I talk to you.
I was right, the fare was wrong.
Mr. Director...
- Is 57 printing?
- Not at first.
- There's an order for lam, .
- Celadon.
Are we doing it?
Not today, we've got urgent
orders for summer cords.
- They called about the fustian.
- In a minute.
You said that next month,
they were firing...
16 people.
Is that true?
Yes, we're installing new machines.
What about us?
You'll look for other work.
Those with seniority will stay.
We've worked here 3 years.
But the machines don't need you.
Your father asked that
you sign this.
- What shall I do with it?
- Do whatever you like.
Get back to work.
Back to the machines.
So much material wasted.
Back to work!
The material's on the ground!
I don't have any time.
Go away...
Welcome doctor!
How is Mr. Buchholtz's health?
Mr. Rubinroth, got anything?
Mr. Rubinroth, got anything?
No.
- Why don't I know about it?
- I thought as there was nothing...
Don't think, listen.
Leave the thinking to me.
I told you...
that I need the news
at home every day.
You are to keep me informed,
that's what I pay you for.
- But I do inform you...
- Not enough.
I see you have time for cakes...
and the newspaper.
I hear you're building a factory.
- Wool, cotton?
- These days, who knows?
- Money?
- We've got a loan.
- Partners?
- Borowiecki and Braun.
Mr. Welt and Mr. Moryc,
how about a cognac?
Get lost.
- I wanted to order...
- That's an old scam.
Scab.
What do you need that Pole for,
and that stupid German?
He's not stupid when he gets enough
sleep and he works hard.
And Borowiecki is the
biggest man in Lodz.
Mr. Borowiecki...
how are the new machines?
They print nearly 10,000
meters every day.
Not enough.
Your rheumatism again?
Why don't you go to Nice?
It doesn't help.
Some people hope I die.
Not many in Lodz.
- You're building a factory.
- I don't understand.
You're a Pole, a noble.
- You have a factory too.
- Because I'm a Buchholtz.
I have the right.
According to you, not everyone can
have their own factory?
Please excuse me.
- You still work for me.
- You never let me forget it.
A harness requires reigns
and a whip...
That doesn't fit everyone.
Not to you, just the
working masses.
They're cattle.
I can say that, I feed them.
They work for it.
They work for me; I give them jobs.
What's that?
Nothing.
Telephone call for Mr. Borowiecki.
What shall I say?
Borowiecki, who's calling?
Is that you?
I love you.
You're crazy.
Will you be at the theater?
Yes, I will.
Going for a walk, Mr. Trawinski?
Yes.
Lodz is very pretty.
You love it.
When you live here 56 years and
know every corner...
it's easy to love it all.
What's new?
Protested promissory notes
are pouring in.
But it doesn't matter.
Why not?
The ragmen will all go to hell,
but Lodz will remain.
It's always a good time
for the clever ones.
What about the honest ones?
Don't talk like that.
They have heaven, what do they
need good times for?
I want Lodz to grow,
I want it to have...
magnificent palaces,
beautiful gardens...
that there be lots of activity...
big business and big money.
What's the matter?
I'm broke again.
I'm broke.
I have notes due this Saturday.
I hold notes from bankrupt
factories, so I've got nothing.
If I don't pay by Saturday,
I'm finished.
- How much?
- Can we talk?
- I has to be here, how much?
- 15,000 rubles.
- That's not much...
- But I don't have it.
- Have you tried Buchholtz?
- It'd be beneath my dignity.
- Aristocratic logic.
- It's the only kind I know.
But you're in Lodz.
- Lend me the money, please.
- I can't.
I'll pledge everything I have
as collateral.
I believe you, but you
don't have any luck.
I'm building a factory.
Thanks to you, I'd go bust.
At least you're honest.
- No hard feelings?
- No.
Have you tried to negotiate?
No, I won't do a deal.
I'll go bankrupt honestly.
- Are you insured?
- I was last autumn.
You should've torched it then.
- Are you serious?
- Sure.
Kelman's burnt down, Grossman
burnt down yesterday.
Tomorrow, Felus Fiszbin and others
will go up in smoke.
I'm not forcing you.
Tough, I'll have to kill myself.
This one's fine for farm-hands.
There's this deal...
Maybe that one?
She has freckles.
The deal is that Adler and Schene
need a lot of wool.
We'll make 15%.
- How much do you need?
- 16,000 marks.
- 10%
- 7,50%
We're setting up a factory
with Borowiecki.
A lovely new one.
Borowiecki is smart...
but unreliable.
Why?
A Pole.
Why a partner?
You could build one yourself.
I don't have the money.
Come see me tonight
after the theater.
Papa!
Kessler signed up our Zoska.
I saw it.
He signed her up and the
foreman led her away.
I'm going to see him.
No, you're not.
It won't help.
Go on now, Adam.
Don't tell your mother anything.
I'll take care of Kessler myself.
- Good morning Mr. Borowiecki.
- Good morning, madam.
Mongrel.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Borowiecki.
You shall help me segregate my
letters, Mr. Borowiecki.
You'll find it amusing.
You'll see what people
write to me.
Now we'll have some fun.
Take them and read.
Kind sir, encouraged
by your fame...
among the unfortunate...
I present my plea for help.
My husband is dying...
Let him die!
Into the fire!
You see how they think highly of
me, of my rubles.
Ringleader of Lodz's thieves...
I like when they spit on me,
it's honest and I have fun.
You German swine.
A jester.
Scoundrel, bandit, criminal,
blood-sucking leech.
You dirty dog, kraut.
It's not signed.
An accusation that the warehouse
manager is stealing.
This must be checked.
This whole bucket of dirt...
Mr. Borowiecki, you know
how to listen.
You are intelligent.
What you say is very interesting.
Give me your hand, we
understand one another.
We make a good team.
My advice is stay with me.
German sentimentality.
My father's a fool.
Change your clothes.
Let him die, but why do I
have to suffer?
- What is it, Mateusz?
- Some peasants, sir.
From Kurowo, with a letter.
Bring me the letter and
them some tea.
I'll go myself.
What is it?
You have a letter from
the young lady?
- Is your name, Socha?
- That's right, Socha...
and I'm his wife.
We want a job in the factory...
To work, tell him...
It's because of Pietrakowa.
What is?
She sicked the dogs on me.
My wife whacked her head against
the house then into the manure!
I kicked her black and blue.
When did she burn you out?
We were at court when the wagon
driver came and told us...
that our hut was on fire.
You want to work in the factory?
Come next Tuesday, I have
no time today.
Are you ready?
Listen to what she wrote.
The roses are lovely,
not from Lodz I think.
Maybe you brought them from Nice?
As you once did.
I tend to them carefully,
saying to each petal...
as I caress it with my lips,
"I love you."
Hurry up.
The money's taken care of.
The entire 25,000.
In your... in our name.
What a golden girl.
I must end as my eyes are getting
heavy; goodnight my golden king.
Goodnight, Anka.
P.S. My father has given in
and made a whistle...
with which he wakes us and
calls us to breakfast.
She sends her regards.
You ought to make the
old man a ward...
declare him incapacitated and
take over the factory.
Would you do that?
I don't have to think about it.
My father has nothing left.
Shall we?
My father won't give any money;
I have to count on myself.
I'll go get Moryc.
Fire!
- Grossman.
- That's the third today.
They're recovering their losses
from bankruptcies.
- Do they have any other way out?
- How much did they lose?
About 200,000.
I called the factory, but you
had already left.
What a pity.
I even wrote to you myself.
I never got it.
Do you have a box?
Only a chair, which is
where I'm going.
I'll give you a few thousand rubles
more if you come work for me.
Buchholtz would give 2,000 more
to have me stay.
I'll give you 4,000 more,
that's 14,000 a year.
Thank you for the splendid offer,
but I can't accept it.
So you're staying with Buchholtz?
No, I'm not.
I'm building my own factory.
Cotton?
Cotton, so I won't be
a competitor.
Competition doesn't scare me.
What could you do to me?
After you go bust, I'll give you
a job, but only for 8,000.
You'd give me more now?
- You're worth it now.
- Thank you for being frank.
But the first flop will protect me
from a second one.
I like you a lot.
We'd do well together.
We have to do it alone.
How many millions are in
the theater tonight?
Around 200.
It reeks of millions.
Rather of onions and garlic.
Nice piece of woman.
Think so?
She had lovely diamonds.
Mrs. Szajnow is wearing an
entire jewelry shop.
She could afford two shops.
I paid, so I'm going to have fun.
- Mada Muller is looking at us.
- She looks like a plucked goose.
But that's 50,000 rubles a year.
What an attractive girl.
- She has a lot of ardor.
- And what a dowry.
Mr. Borowiecki, I wanted to
talk business with you.
Not here.
One talks about business
everywhere!
That depends on with whom.
I know, as factory director, you
had to say what you did.
But this is about the
factory business.
Yes, but I've had my
fill of Lodz.
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.
What about your father's factory?
I don't care about that.
You're an complete oddball.
Incomparable.
Good evening.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Absolutely, excellently.
And you?
Excellently, absolutely, or
absolutely, excellently.
Karol, I wanted to ask you...
for some titles of books in Polish
for me to read.
Papa says I'm stupid and should
only take interest in...
the household.
What do you need books for?
Because I want to.
Doesn't your brother
have a library?
Wilhelm doesn't like books.
Once he was angry at me...
and when I was in town with mama...
he burned all my books.
Wilhelm doesn't like books.
He's a good boy.
Fine, I'll send you some.
You're a good boy...
please come visit us.
Congratulations, ladies.
Marvelous, charming.
So very young.
My name's Max Baum.
90 Piotrowska Street.
They dance beautifully.
I thought you'd appear too.
I wanted to, but nobody asked me.
They wanted to, but were afraid.
Not everyone gets into your home.
Something's going on.
Look at the boxes.
It's cotton.
Wool and the others are calm.
Alpatow.
Failure in Odessa.
I'll go find out.
I got it all.
Frumkin in Bialystok,
Lichaczew in Rostow...
and in Odessa, Alpatow.
They've all gone bankrupt.
Solid companies.
- Why?
- I don't know.
- How much is Lodz involved?
- Losses of 2 million.
What about your father?
All he has to lose is his honor,
which is worth nothing here.
But why?!
- Mejer will lose 100,000 rubles.
- And his fat belly too.
Karol, when will you
be visiting us?
Within the next few days perhaps.
- I thought you'd forgotten me.
- Is that even possible?
- For you, yes.
- But I've come.
- To the theater.
- To you.
You've never spoken
to me like this.
But I always wanted to.
You were talking about me.
I could feel it.
We were talking about
your diamonds.
No other woman has
gems like these.
And about your beauty.
Now you're making fun.
I never joke about that
which I love.
Take me to the carriage.
We'll go out together.
Even to ends of the earth.
I don't get it, it's in code.
Read it.
A resolution was passed today.
The tariff on American cotton
will be increased to 25 kopeks.
It will be announced in one week
and go into effect in two weeks.
- Has Mr. Welt left?
- He's gone to Mr. Kessler's.
- You rarely come round...
- I live far away.
You have blue threads all over
your back and shoulders.
Everyone's so entangled...
And on your back too.
Got any idea?
- It's a great deal.
16,000 marks for Berlin and
we'll make 15%.
I told you I had a better plan.
Borowiecki is surrounded.
He has no money.
He's spent everything
on his factory.
I'll give you the money.
We'll be partners and you'll move
Borowiecki to the sidelines.
He'll be director of the plant
for a year or two.
In three years, you'll
clear 40,000.
Mr. Kessler...
thank you for the
wonderful offer...
but Borowiecki is a bigger man in
Lodz than you are.
I am Moryc Welt.
90 Piotrowska Street.
I am Moryc Welt...
Moryc, I've got a deal!
You have a deal.
You have an extremely
important deal.
I'm fine.
Here, read this.
Don't look at the address.
I don't understand,
it's in code.
A resolution was passed today
that the tariff on cotton...
will be increased to 25 kopeks.
It will go into effect in two weeks
and be announced in one week.
Karol!
We have a future!
We've got a lot of money.
That telegram is worth 100,000.
50,000 at least.
We can kiss each other now.
I don't need your kisses,
I need your cash.
Why don't we do this
deal ourselves?
Leave him alone.
We can do this marvelous deal.
Call Max.
You know, after this I know you
even less than before.
We have to wake Max!
- Why wake him up?
- So we can deliberate.
Why not the two of us?
The three of us do the deal.
Did I say we wouldn't?
I'm going to Hamburg.
What if this deal falls through?
It can't, we must build
the factory.
That's what I said, we must
have this factory.
You, Karol, will survive
for sure.
With your recognized skills,
your aristocratic name and...
your face, you can get millions,
even if it's from Miss Muller.
I have a fiancee.
You can have two to love and
marry a third with millions.
What's the news on the street?
Aweber burnt down.
Kolberg did too, just walls left,
but the police smell a rat.
The insurance companies don't
want to pay damages.
Moryc went to see Grinspan today,
and Max's visitors are...
Put me down for 10,000 rubles,
I can't give any more.
Come here, Goddamn it,
we have to discuss this!
To hell with your 'discussions! '
Poles!
For three years in Riga...
I hardly slept because Poles had
discussions every night.
It's the same in Lodz.
Fine, go back to your room.
No, no, I'll stay.
- Moryc, how much are you in for?
- 10000,00
I can't raise any more right now.
Me too.
Who's going?
Moryc, it's his specialty.
How much cash are you
putting in?
I only have 15 rubles, but
I can add my ring...
which you can pawn.
There's a way out.
You can make a profit
with no risk.
How?
I'll buy out your share of the deal
and give you 5,000...
10,000 in compensation.
So what if I take a loss.
I can have the cash soon.
You prick.
Hold on, he's doing it
out of friendship.
Yeah, sure!
That's right, friendship.
What if I lose money?
I'll give you IOUs with
solid guarantees.
We're all risking together and
he's going to Hamburg.
I want him to cover it.
So he doesn't cheat us.
What about a friend's word?
Promises and friendship are
important, but this is business.
So let Moryc buy it and
ship it to us...
and we'll buy it here.
How do I know you
won't cheat me?
- You prick.
- Calm down!
Moryc is right.
That's why I've drawn up this
written agreement.
Now we're on solid footing.
How much are you giving me
to do this deal?
Normal commission for now,
we'll work it out later.
Advance me part of it and
I'll present a bill...
my expenses in Hamburg.
Isn't he a prick?
That's three times he's called me a
prick, now I'll call him, stupid!
Remember, this isn't love or
marriage, it's business.
You'd cheat God himself if
you thought it'd work.
- I'm going to sleep.
- Good luck.
Don't interrupt.
We'll see each other
before you leave.
I'll get the money.
Just don't cheat us.
As if you could be cheated!
You're a good man, but I can smell
you're a swindler a mile away.
Who, me?
Yes, I was at Kessler's; I don't
want to die in a spinning room.
Go to him then.
If you come home, I'll chase you
off like a dog and call the police.
Mama, I couldn't take any more;
he loves me!
He promised he'd marry me.
Don't punish me, Lord,
for her blindness.
Don't punish me, Lord...
for children I'm guilty for,
because I am not guilty.
I no longer have a daughter.
Mama dear, beloved mama...
forgive me, have mercy on me.
I didn't want to spend my whole
life in that factory.
Get out of my sight!
Zosia, wait!
The foreman said if I didn't go
they'd throw me out of the factory.
Don't cry, mama will come around
and I'll talk to father myself.
Has Zosia returned?
This morning.
- Kessler?
- Yes.
But he's mine...
Stupid, I'll take of this.
Don't you even dare.
But I won't let him
get away with it.
Don't even try!
Where is she now?
Mother threw her out
of the house.
Look after her.
She's family.
- I'll give him an answer...
- Are you armed?
He's like a mad dog.
He's after money for his daughter.
Be careful!
Malinowski!
You wrote this letter to me?!
What did you do to Zosia?
What do you want?
Nothing.
You'll pay me for her!
How's by you, Mr. Stein?
Victor Hugo died yesterday.
Did he leave a lot?
- 6 million francs.
- A pretty penny.
In what?
Pension, 3%.
- And in Suez bonds.
- Excellent paper.
- What was his line?
- Literature.
He was a great poet.
- A great writer.
- German?
- A Frenchman.
- Right, I forgot.
So that was his novel,
"With Fire and Sword."
Mary read me some of
the nicer excerpts.
So, you play the piano?
I studied piano at the
conservatory in Vienna.
Excuse me, sir...
I must be going, I have work to do.
Work is not a goose,
it won't run away.
I don't like the constant
clinking of glasses in the
counting house...
and the hissing of gas.
We come to work early, sir...
and haven't had breakfast.
They boil tea with the gas.
Who pays for the gas?
Me, and where's the sense in that?
From now on, you will pay for it.
I'll tell my colleagues.
I'm doing it for your own good.
Now they are ashamed
to drink the tea...
their conscience bothers them
because it's with my gas.
If they pay, no more shame.
They'll look me in the eye again.
And that is very moral, Mr. Stein,
very moral indeed.
Greetings, sir!
Business? Let's take
care of it first...
as I have a delicate matter
to discuss with you.
The deal concerns wool for
Adler and Company.
I'd take care of it, the wool's
there, but I don't have any money.
I'll give you the money and
we'll do the deal together.
15%.
- How much do you need?
- 30,000 marks.
Is the factory being built?
We begin in a month...
In three months it'll be roofed
over and we start in October.
I like a fast pace,
it's the Lodz way.
I like Borowiecki very much...
but I must do something
disagreeable to him.
It's unpleasant for me,
very unpleasant.
Please explain why I've
done this to him.
I had to recall his loan.
We'll get it elsewhere.
I'm so sorry I won't be able
to do business with you.
But between us, as friends...
why Borowiecki as a partner?
Can't you do it by yourself?
I don't have any money.
But that's no reason; there
are people who do.
They trust you and know
that you are capable.
Why, on just your word...
did I give you 30,000 marks?
Why do I treat you like a son?
No, like a son and a daughter!
Because I know you well...
and also know that I can
earn 10% on this.
7,5.
Borowiecki wants to improve quality
and put an end to Lodz trash!
Those are his very own
stupid words.
He wants to ruin business
for Zuker...
Szaj, Buchholtz, all of
Lodz's cotton mills.
Do you know why?
So that Poles can say...
they produce trash, swindle us
and exploit workers.
While Borowiecki and we are
serious, solid and honest.
I can see into the future and
funny it isn't at all.
Under no circumstances.
I'm telling you, we will not
survive the competition.
They'll have the country's support,
so Borowiecki must be swallowed.
But if my capital...
earns more with Borowiecki,
I'm going with him.
That's a merchant's approach.
I guarantee you, that capital
will give you nothing.
You could lose everything.
I wish you well, but must tell you
what our Lodz is thinking.
Goodbye and thank you very much
for the warning.
Borowiecki has no loan with you?
I have to stick with
the factory owners.
A conspiracy.
What are you saying?!
It's no plot, it's self-defense.
If it wasn't Borowiecki...
we could step on him lightly
and he'd quickly die.
But you know what a printer he is
and how he's helped Buchholtz?
That's all true.
But he might just make it.
- Where'd you get this much?
- That's my secret.
I see in your eyes some new
rascally trick.
No, that's not it.
I finally got the money
from my father.
Now his factory won't
last a year.
When it fails, my father won't
survive either.
He'll die too.
You're a sentimental German,
but lets have the money.
You can take comfort knowing your
father was Lodz's most honest man.
Yes, yes.
Here's my ring.
We'll keep our fingers crossed.
Break a leg.
Pay the woman 200 rubles...
or else she'll sue us.
Baron Oscar Moyer is waiting...
with something important.
He can kiss my dog...
in the nose!
Horn, I'm dictating!
I don't pay you to sleep.
Faster!
I can't write with two hands.
- You accent your words too much.
- I'm speaking normally.
Be careful.
I don't care.
Who are you talking to?
To you.
My patience is wearing thin.
Who cares.
Don't interrupt Buchholtz!
I don't see why Buchholtz should
interrupt Horn.
You no longer work for me!
Working for you has been
one huge obscenity.
- I order you thrown out!
- Try it, you boor.
August! Get out of here just
after that!
Forget it. August.
I'll break both your and your
master's ribs.
Both of you can leave,
Goddamn it...
Shut up you thief!
You ignorant pig...
Please don't interrupt me!
I could care les if you're
patient or not!
I don't need to know...
Please don't interrupt!
You kraut bastard!
I'm speaking, Horn, and
you'll listen to me...
as long as I'm speaking!
Now I'm speaking!
Please don't...
I'm warning you, I don't need to
know if you're patient or not!
I don't have to be quiet when you
speak and consider...
your patience!
Goodbye.
August!
Yes sir.
Where is Horn?
You threw him out, sir,
and so he left.
I told you to throw him out.
He left of his own accord.
What's new?
Work.
It's quiet somehow.
Just like always.
August!
You play that piece better
all the time.
That music reminds me of
someone weeping.
You played out of tune
three times, then...
you played an octave lower.
But I pulled it up quickly.
- You reek of perfume!
- I took some in on consignment.
- Are you into everything now?
- And a few more besides.
Stop looking at your watch.
- Do you have to go to work?
- No, I'm through with the office.
Did you win the lottery?
Rob a train?
No.
It's a great business that'll
put me on my feet.
It's just anti-Semitic drivel which
you don't believe; you know...
that a big gudgeon eats a roach,
a perch eats the gudgeon...
a pike eats the perch, and
a person eats the pike.
Then people eat other people.
They get eaten by bankruptcies,
illnesses and death.
That's as it should be.
Life is beautiful, because that
sets everything in motion.
You have a Talmudic
philosophy, David.
Because I've been observing this
world for a long time.
- What if this doesn't work?
- The market has to change.
It'll be a good year for grain, but
prices won't fall... no reserves.
With public works projects people will earn some money.
By autumn, the fabric business
will be back on its feet.
We can always process
the cotton ourselves...
- Where's the cotton?
- Relax, it's in Hamburg.
The prices went up.
Supplies are short and the next
shipments are in a few days.
Hello sir.
We're going to Kurowo tomorrow;
I'm taking you.
The young master's here!
Calm down, dogs.
This is no tenant Jew.
This is Moryc, Karol's friend.
You're finally here, son.
I've missed you.
We've all missed you.
Anka!
In a moment, Father, you'll see
what sort of game this is.
Do you find it very boring here?
I will not answer such
an insinuation.
Your life amazes me.
It's so... calm and simple.
As if it were better.
You know, Miss Anna...
since I began coming here, I've
come to understand Poles better.
Karol.
Has some misfortune met Karol?
- No, did you notice something?
- It seemed to me it had.
I'm not going to stand
in your way.
Remember that four centuries of
our family tradition...
is alive and you must respect it.
Father...
What good is that tradition in
the production of percale?
How can my ancestors help me get
loans and run the factory.
That I get from Jews.
I don't want to be someone's
farm hand.
I must be free from
my noble past...
because those ties make it hard to
fight an unscrupulous opponent.
Without tradition, he is
a terrible adversary...
who alone is his own past,
present and future.
Let us not talk of this.
You feed the fowl yourself?
Yes.
Just like Zosia in "Pan Tadeusz."
She did it for pleasure.
And you?
To sell them well in Lodz.
Hello.
That Father Simon of yours is
walking kindness in a cassock.
In Kurowo, kindness is
most profitable.
Try making a living from
swindling here!
In Lodz I have one name, and
in the country another.
When I'm in Lodz I'm Kaczmarek...
where any Kraut or Scab calls out,
Kaczmarek, come here.
But when I'm Kaczmarski, they say,
Would you please be so kind.
Why should Germans
push me around?
I come from a long
line of farmers...
and I'm not a mere nobody.
So you're taking the pictures and
furniture to Lodz?
When we were farming here,
these various Germans...
were living like animals
in the forests.
- Bravo, Mr. Kaczmarski.
- It's the truth.
And all those Mullers,
Buchholtzs...
would be honored to have me,
Kaczmarski, as their king.
Good morning.
I didn't know it was you.
Karol spoke of a buyer, but he
gave a different last name.
Coffee?
Sure, is it hot?
Very.
Cold coffee is worthless.
- So you know good coffee?
- I always drink the nasty stuff.
Nothing like black coffee for
talking business.
I won't be living here.
I'm marrying off my son.
It's for him.
He doesn't have a head
for business.
There's nothing in Lodz for him.
Here he'll be a squire.
Buchholtz is dead.
He had a factory, had millions,
was a real count, yet he's dead.
I don't have anything except
problems with promissory notes...
yet I'm alive.
God is good, very good.
So people are resting
today for free.
You're wrong, we cut their pay
by half a day.
They can rest for free, they're
grateful to the late Mr. Buchholtz.
Come closer...
I have to see you.
This way they'll recover part
of the funeral costs.
I must do the same thing
for my heirs.
But Buchholtz was older than you.
You'd have to become a Protestant
to have a funeral like this.
I don't like Protestantism.
I love and need beauty.
I want to have a better funeral.
After a week of hard work,
I want to relax.
I want to go to a nice place, where
there are paintings and statues...
Iovely architecture, nice ceremony
and where they play sweetly.
He likes our ceremonies,
colors and scents...
those bells and hymns.
And the sermon can't be boring.
He wants to listen to delicate
talk on loftier subjects.
That gives a person humor
and a desire to live.
Protestant churches are so bare
they look closed for business.
The pastor talks about hell,
very unpleasant.
I should go to a church just
to get upset?
Besides I don't getting depressed
with boring prattle.
And I like to know the company.
What is Protestantism?
The Pope, now there's a company!
Buchholz left a lot of money for
public and charitable causes.
Just gossip, he wasn't stupid.
Telegram, sir!
Cotton!
Turn around!
Go back home.
- Have you heard about cotton?
- What do I care?
Have read the new tariffs?
I'm a bit under the weather today.
I'm sad and you're bothering me
about cotton.
Moryc, how are you?
Just like today's cotton.
- You mean good?
- Like diamonds.
- Have you read the tariffs?
- I've known them for a week.
- But they just announced them.
- No matter.
- And you didn't take advantage?
- Of course I did.
Borowiecki will tell you
how many we have...
how many are at the station and how
many are coming from Hamburg.
You're too clever and may not
see any profits.
I will, because I need
to earn money...
for a better funeral
than Buchholtz had.
Father, we're in Lodz.
Good morning.
We're here.
How was the trip?
Fine, thank you.
Those walls are my...our factory.
Why do you work so much?
- You shouldn't.
- But I have to.
- What's this?
- Money.
- Where'd you get it?
- I had it.
I don't know how to thank you.
- It came just in time.
- Stop it, someone may walk in.
- You're such a child.
- Because I'm happy and in love.
You talk about love out loud.
Love is nothing to be ashamed of.
Do you have a pistol?
Yes, why?
I'll feel safer.
What are you afraid of?
I don't know, but I'm
very frightened.
There are no bandits here.
Quiet!
I am so happy!
We're going to have a child.
Isn't it wonderful?
A child?
Now I have to be with
you forever.
This is madness.
Isn't love madness?
It'll be best if we don't see
each other for a while.
He wants to send me
away to Berlin.
I love you so very much.
Don't be angry at me!
I'm so afraid I'll never
see you again.
Your eyes now turned away...
day and night look this way...
Hello Karol.
Coming from town?
As usual.
Be careful!
Quickly, because Karol's tired.
Aren't you hungry?
I'll make you some tea,
nice and strong.
Lot's of sugar?
Would you like some jam?
I still have them from Kurowo.
You'll like them.
I've heard that you'd like to make a hospital
out of my factory.
But he doesn't have any family.
A factory is not a shelter
for vagabonds.
But he had an accident there.
Working.
Are you serious?
Was I to leave him in the street?
You like to sentimentalize
straightforward matters.
It's sweet, but unnecessary.
That depends on how one reacts
to human suffering.
I can't get sentimental...
over every lame dog,
wilted flower...
But his ribs are broken.
So let him die, God bless him.
So is what I'm saying foolish,
funny, and deserving of irony?
And you said what you did
to hurt me, right?
Forgive me, I'm tired today.
I'm already dead, but I'll
tell you one thing.
You're hurting Anka and someday
you'll regret it.
Why won't you marry her?
I don't want to see a tenant,
some swindler's daughter...
taking over the mementos...
of our family's past.
What would they have to say?
You mock our past...
you call tradition a corpse,
nobility a false notion...
and virtue a superstition.
You've sold your soul
for a golden calf!
They didn't send the
dyeing machines.
I've written to England, they're
sending them, later and dearer.
They didn't want to give credit.
Goddamn Krauts!
Everything's too expensive.
It's going to be a palace,
not a factory.
That's cake batter, not limestone.
We're spending too much money.
Let others build junk, I don't want
it crashing down on my head.
In case of a fire, not
everything will burn.
Sometimes burning to the ground
isn't so bad.
Don't be a wise guy,
sell cotton.
The till's empty and there
won't be any more.
Are they conspiring against us?
They refused our last loan.
Spend 40,000 rubles cash and stop
because they won't lend us money?
In Lodz, where anyone can build
without spending...
a penny of their own?!
Who builds a factory using
their own money?
How much do you need?
10,000 rubles, by Saturday.
You forgot about Muller.
He offered you a loan.
I remember, one word and he'll
open his cash box for me.
But he'll never hear it.
But this is about our factory.
If I were you, I'd do it.
But you're not me, Max,
remember that.
Sell the rest of the cotton!
I won't borrow from moneylenders!
Our factory will be built,
and as long as I'm alive...
will be successful.
You sound like a poet.
Hello, how are you?
Thank you.
Oh my God!
Sometimes I keep my word.
You made up a book list for me?
I would do anything for you.
You're not lying?
According to you, all men lie?
I don't know.
You have beautiful flowers.
I'll tell Gotibow,
he'll be pleased.
- Who's he?
- Our gardener.
Our neighbor says we'd get more benefit if we
planted potatoes in our pots.
He's stupid, isn't he?
Why didn't you tell me that
Mr. Borowiecki was here.
Come, father.
Mama didn't want to interrupt
your work.
I've got problems.
Production must go on,
but sales are down.
You don't have to worry
about the worst season.
Let me show you my house.
They say marvelous things
about it in Lodz.
It cost me 100,000 rubles.
But everything is new;
I don't buy junk.
I can afford new things.
Sit down.
Cigar?
These are strong.
These are weaker.
I'll try the stronger one.
- Want to see the whole place?
- Gladly.
Mr. Muller!
This is all imported!
Hiberman says that here...
all we can get is rubbish.
Wonderful, absolutely wonderful!
This is our Spanish room.
Papa's wrong, it's our
Mauritanian room.
Did you decorate it yourself?
I paid for it myself.
- Do you like the room?
- It's lovely and original.
It cost a lot.
Every proper palace has a
Chinese or Japanese room.
You don't live here?
I sleep better in the old house.
Isn't a shame to have it
stand empty?
Let it stand.
Everyone's building palaces,
so I did too.
Everyone has a salon, so
I have a salon too.
It was expensive, but that's
all right, I can afford it.
Let people know that Muller
has money and a palace.
This is for Mada when
she gets married.
Yes, it really is a magnificent
room to sleep in.
You have a room like
Gretchen Goethe.
Mada is stupid.
I'll marry her to a Pole.
I like Polish salons.
I like entertaining guests
in your style.
There's no Pole in Lodz...
wealthy enough to be
your son-in-law.
I've heard you are in trouble.
That's right, that's
why I'm here.
I'm having some difficulties
and I wanted to ask...
I'll give you the money and
I'll be a silent partner.
I don't know how to thank you.
I pledge my estate as security.
That's thinking like a merchant.
What do you suggest?
Why should you marry that Anka?
Excuse me, but that's
my business.
I'm not saying a thing.
- Is the director in?
- He's been waiting a long time.
How are you?
My good man, how are... you?
I was very worried about
your health.
It's not nice to keep a friend
in uncertainty for so long.
I've missed seeing you.
Thank you, you are a good person.
Of course... yesterday I gave 25
rubles for summer camps.
How's our wool?
I bought it and sold
it for cash.
That's good, as I need
a lot of cash today.
Who doesn't?
You'll have it because
you are clever.
Did you know that your mother
was my cousin?
She sold scrap materials.
You a similar to her.
She was lovely and generously
proportioned.
- Yu have the money?
- No.
Then send it before four as I have
promissory notes to pay today.
Did we earn a lot?
I did, but you?
We were partners, I gave
you the capital!
I have the capital.
We had an agreement
for 10% interest.
I'll pay the interest, but
I'm keeping the capital.
What are you talking about?
Have you got bats in the belfry?!
I've invested that money
in my business.
My money?
It was a long-term loan.
Mr. Maurycy Welt...
you will return my 30,000
marks immediately!
No, Mr. Grinspan, I'm 30 years old
and it's time I started.
I'll pay the interest, but I'll pay
you the rest when I earn it.
You've gone crazy, you're sick...
tired of traveling, business and
you need rest.
Mr. Stein, call the police!
Now we'll talk differently!
You thief, I'll have them put you
through the wringer.
Shut up!
I'll have you jailed for insults.
Don't threaten me with the police!
Where's your proof
that the money...
is yours, and not mine?!
My father's gone completely nuts.
He spends nights in the factory.
Starting up the machines.
I've got the money!
He's got your picture.
We can open the factory!
We're opening it!
My factory, it's mine and
I'll never let it go.
I share your joy;
I'm happy too.
But not like I am.
Happy lady, right?
It'd be more beautiful
in the country.
So, you're not very happy?
On the contrary, very.
I'm glad when people's
dreams come true.
From your voice I would've thought
something else entirely.
August 6...
the new Karol Borowiecki and Co.
Factory began operations.
Obligations will be signed by
Mr. Borowiecki or Mr. Welt.
Here's to the director!
So that it grows big
and never burns.
- We should've insured it.
- Find the money!
Cut it out, we built it and
why should it burn now?
Excuse me sir...
Zuker is waiting in the office.
What does he want?
I'll be right back.
What a pleasure to welcome you,
though I don't have much time...
as were opening the factory today.
Read this.
What am I to make of it?
That's your business.
I wouldn't let him
get away with it.
That's your answer?
What am I supposed to say in answer
to this hideous slander?
What am I to do with this?
What am I to think?
Find the author and send him to
Siberia for fabricating lies.
Don't mention it to anyone.
I can help find him, as it
concerns me as well.
Mr. Borowiecki, I am also
a man just like you.
I have feelings and my own honor.
So I've come and I ask,
swearing to God...
is this letter true?
No, it isn't.
I'm a Jew, a simple Jew.
I'm not going to shoot you.
I'm powerless to hurt you.
You know, she's going to give
birth in a few months.
Do you know what a child means?
For 14 years I've waited.
Fourteen years and
now this news!
Do I know whose
child it is?
You must tell me the truth!
Mr. Zuker...I've told you it's a lie...
Your type likes married women!
Bring wine and seltzer.
Take this you know where.
I told him to bring some wine,
as I see you're...
tired and upset.
I really feel sorry for you.
Since it's a lie, there's
nothing to worry about.
Let's have a drink.
Mr. Borowiecki, an oath
is a great thing.
I want you to swear
on this icon.
I know...that for you Poles
it is sacred.
Swear that it isn't true.
All right.
I swear on this holy picture
that your wife and I...
have never had any relations.
Is that enough?
I believe you now.
You have saved my life!
I believe you as I believe
myself and Lucy.
My dear Mr. Borowiecki!
Of course, but...
Welcome, Mr. Muller.
Thank you for coming.
Hello.
In Berlin, visit aunt Rose
and uncle Hans.
And take care of yourself,
and our child!
Be careful.
Take care of yourself,
and of our baby!
Oh sir...
- Are you certain?
- I saw him get on.
Set fire to his factory, but
I don't know a thing about it!
I've torched others,
I can do it again.
Well, Mr. Borowiecki, you should
have taken out insurance!
What's the matter?
Get married.
Please forgive me.
It's only gossip.
But gossip can kill even the
most magnificent love.
I'm much obliged.
What gossip?
Tel me.
In Lodz they say...
that Karol would marry
Made Muller if...
- If not for me.
- So you know?
No.
But you just told me.
Excuse me.
You know...
fact is...
I don't care anymore.
Anka, what happened?
Nothing.
Madam, fire!
The factory's on fire!
What's going on?
- People...
- Karol!
Moryc.
Here, hurry!
Karol!
Where is Karol?!
In Berlin!
I'll send a telegram.
Mr. Borowiecki, telegram.
- What's wrong?
- The factory's burning.
Whose?
Mine!
Who ordered you to burn it?
Karol...
it will be better this way.
It's your fault.
Because of your affair.
No... What are you saying?!
You're bitter, you're lying,
it wasn't Karol.
Say it isn't true!
I have nothing.
You have nothing.
So we have just the right
amount, just right...
Very good, in that case,
I broke even.
YEARS LATER
There isn't a scoundrel who wouldn't
like to become an angel.
No Karol, there isn't.
Yes, I agree.
We have no choice.
Shoot them.
