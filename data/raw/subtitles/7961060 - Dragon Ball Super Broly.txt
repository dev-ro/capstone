PLANET VEGETA
41 YEARS AGO
Damn it!
They're crazy!
How rude!
They mock us with a visit like this!
Great King Cold has arrived.
So it would seem.
It's been too long, King Vegeta.
Great King Cold, welcome.
Allow me to introduce my son, Frieza.
It is a pleasure to meet you,
Frieza-sama.
The pleasure is mine.
Getting right to it,
I have decided to retire.
As of now, Frieza will be
taking over my forces.
Put another way, the Cold force
will now be the Frieza force.
Nothing will change.
The Saiyans need only work according
to the Frieza force's orders.
If there is any slight difference,
it would be that Frieza is even
more cold-hearted than I am.
Greetings.
I have special expectations
from all of you Saiyans.
To commemorate my installment today,
I brought you some new combat items.
These are newly developed
devices called Scouters.
They are made more compact
than the surveillance Scout Scopes
that you have been using up to now,
and you can also simultaneously
use them as communicators.
It displays your subject's position,
battle power, and range,
just as your Scopes
have done up to now.
Oh...
It appears that a number of Saiyans
are targeting us with weapons.
That Saiyan hiding in there
has a battle power of...
...2,000.
That is quite outstanding.
That is the gist of it.
Handy, are they not?
For now, I will present you
with 500 units.
If that is not enough, please let me know.
Goodbye, now.
Ho! Look how big he is getting.
My son, my pride and joy,
your latent battle power
is a natural gift.
It is you who will become the king
of the universe, not that monster Frieza.
I look forward to seeing you grow.
Who is this?
What is he doing in a special capsule?
Majesty!
This child is Broly.
He is the son of Colonel Paragus.
Tell me why!
This nursery room is here
for exceptional babies
who will become Saiyan elites!
Yes, Majesty. You see... Broly's
latent abilities are especially high.
Are you telling me he has a rating
that rivals my brilliant son?
Yes, Majesty.
When we gauged him,
his level far exceeded the prince's.
That isn't possible. The prince's own
rating was record-setting!
Give me that!
I am terribly sorry, Majesty!
It appears to have malfunctioned.
I will get a new gauge.
Coming right now.
After further measurement,
his rating is less than half of before.
He did have some anomalous
readings in the past,
but they must have been
due to gauge malfunctions.
But even purging the anomalous data,
Broly's latent abilities
are still substantial.
Once he receives training, he will grow
to become an outstanding warrior
and be a powerful asset for our forces.
He could even be
the legendary Super Saiyan...
Paragus-sama!
Please wait!
Hey! Get away from me!
Please wait!
Please forgive my discourteousness.
I understand that you plan
to launch my son Broly
to an outlying world by pod?
That's right.
That is a job for a lower-class warrior.
If he develops enough
to subjugate that world,
he could become
an even stronger warrior.
Dominating worlds
and selling them for a high price,
that is what
the warrior Saiyan race does.
His destination,
the Planetoid Vampa,
is an inhospitable world
without even any people on it.
I do not see how it could sell
for very much.
Your son's latent abilities
are abnormally elevated.
He could even be called a mutant.
Someday, he will be unable
to maintain his mental state,
and will be a danger not just to
my Vegeta forces, but the whole universe.
Be grateful that I am sending him
to another world,
and not just ending his life outright!
How could you?
You are jealous of Broly's latent abilities
which surpass the prince's,
and are just trying to get rid of him!
Say one more word,
and you'll end up dead.
Besides, it's already too late.
The pod has just been launched.
What?
Move!
What are you doing?
Just a moment!
You don't have permission to launch!
They're not authorized!
That's dangerous!
Return here at once!
Repeat, return here at once!
Please return at once!
I can't do that.
I have to save my son!
King Vegeta boasted of how his prince,
who was born at the same time,
had prodigious latent abilities.
He didn't like the fact that
my son Broly's abilities exceed them.
The pod's destination
is some outlying planet.
A Planetoid called Vampa,
orbiting around Star 94.
Why? There aren't any
inhabited planets in that area.
The king's goal is not
to claim the planet,
he means to get rid of my son Broly.
Oh, my...
Don't worry, Beets. Once I rescue Broly,
we'll go live on some other world.
You'll drop us off there
and head back to Planet Vegeta.
You aren't coming back, sir?
Of course not.
If I did, I'd just be executed.
I will raise Broly to be a mighty warrior,
and someday take revenge
against King Vegeta!
So that's Planetoid Vampa.
My calculations say that
the pod arrived here two days ago.
Please be alive, Broly.
I'm coming to save you right now.
He should be over there somewhere!
It seemed calmer over where
there was still light. Let's land there!
No, we're going in hard, here!
We have to go look for him, now!
Come with me!
Me, too, sir?
Yes. I can't have you taking off
on me while I'm searching.
I wouldn't do that.
Please trust me.
Ha! Is there such a thing
as a trustworthy Saiyan?
I understand that there's a new model
of those Scout Scopes.
Frieza, our new leader,
supposedly brought some with him.
I know.
This Frieza guy is said to be
incredibly impressive.
Makes no difference to me now.
What could that be?
What are those things?
You can't be serious!
I'm not even a combatant!
It looks like the night and the storms
come as a set.
Now it's hot, though.
Could that world be a satellite?
It's perfectly full.
Don't look at it too long.
You'll become a Great Ape.
Huh? Oh, right. I've never actually
turned Great Ape before.
Great Apes lose all sense of themselves.
The only time to become one is
if you're cornered with no other way out.
What is this?
The ground is soft.
This doesn't seem like grass.
Those things...
It looks like they're drinking
something out of the ground.
What is that?
That wasn't grassland,
it's a giant beast.
Those monsters live
by sucking the beasts' blood.
The beasts then live off
of those monsters.
This world sure is gross...
The pod! The pod is over there!
He's not here.
Where did he go?
Could he have been eaten, maybe?
Over there.
Are you sure this is it?
Broly!
You attacked a monster
and ate its leg? That's my boy!
That's Broly?
Battle power 920?
That's stronger than I am, you know!
Even if he is a gifted child
with a high battle power,
he couldn't have defeated
that monster at 920.
Look here. His suit is a bit
stretched and baggy.
He must have looked at that full moon
and turned Great Ape.
Let's hurry and leave this world.
It got pretty roughed up, huh?
Oh, no!
What is it?
The main floater is cracked!
You mean you can't fix it?
Absolutely not.
Without a new floater...
What?
You mean we're stuck here?
We can't even radio for help like this.
There's enough food and water
for ten days.
Do you think anyone will find us
in just ten days?
We really shouldn't have
crash landed after all.
This will save one person's
worth of food.
FIVE YEARS LATER
Bardock-San... Bardock-San!
What?
We're almost to Planet Vegeta.
It's been a long time, huh?
Yeah.
What do you suppose this is about,
ordering the Saiyans to hurry
and assemble at Planet Vegeta?
Apparently, that Frieza bastard
ordered it.
Take off your Scouter.
They'll hear you.
Ah, that's right!
Look at that.
All the others
are coming back home, too.
Look over there.
That's Frieza's ship.
There's still some time left,
but it's already standing by?
You don't think it's strange?
If he just wants to speak to us,
he doesn't need to bring us back
to the planet, he could just use the radio.
If he wants to give us new weapons,
there's no point in hurrying
to gather us together.
There really is something fishy
going on here.
Huh? What do you mean, fishy?
Conquering planets and selling them
has always been the livelihood
of the warrior Saiyan race.
Then Frieza's father, Cold,
subjugated us by force
and placed us under his rule.
That was a long time ago, right?
Do you think
we're getting along well now?
Well, there aren't any Saiyans
that like Frieza.
And Frieza likely feels
the same way about Saiyans.
Huh?
Right now, the Frieza force
has grown larger.
They could probably get by
even without us annoying Saiyans around.
You're not saying he's planning
to exterminate us, are you?
I'm just saying, maybe.
Oh, come on, Bardock-San.
Yo, Bardock!
Made it back alive, huh?
Hey, do you know the reason
for this summons order?
Beats me. Maybe they found
a fairly big-league world to go after.
Something that will take
all of us to conquer.
That's it! That's what this is.
Come to think of it, the people
that report directly to Frieza
were going around asking
about the Super Saiyan.
The Super Saiyan?
Like in the legend?
That's why!
The Super Saiyan...
...and Super Saiyan God...
We've looked into them,
but they appear to just be legends.
That is about what I was thinking.
I cannot afford the least bit of anxiety,
so I had to make sure.
So then, are you cancelling the attack?
You must be joking.
Not after they
have all assembled together.
This is the perfect opportunity to be rid
of them, planet and all, is it not?
Welcome home, Bardock-San!
Yeah.
Yo, I'm home, Gine.
Huh? Bardock!
Things sure are buzzing in town.
Yeah, since everyone has come home.
Where's Raditz?
He's a combatant now.
He's teamed with Prince Vegeta,
and they're off on some other world.
They haven't come back yet, though.
Prince Vegeta, huh?
There's a piece of work
to be stuck with.
What about Kakarot?
Still in the child-rearing capsule?
Yeah.
It's just about time to let him
out, though. Want to see him?
He's small.
He seems to be the slow-starter type.
He looks just like you, though,
doesn't he?
Especially your distinctive hairstyle.
After dark, I'm going to go steal a pod.
We're going to send him
to another world.
Huh? You're kidding, right?
No, I'm serious.
Why would you go and do
something like that now?
He hasn't even learned to talk yet!
With Kakarot's latent abilities,
he's destined to be sent away anyhow.
So, we're going to see to it
that it's at least a better planet.
But it's still too soon.
There may not be any time left.
Time?
Frieza is afraid of the legendary
Super Saiyan appearing.
Super Saiyan?
But that's... only a fable, isn't it?
Yeah. But he can't help
but be bothered by it.
And he's up to no good.
I get the feeling
that death is on its way.
On second thought, let's not do this.
Don't worry.
If I turn out to be wrong,
I'll go rescue him right away.
In that case, why don't the three of us
run away someplace?
We can't. We'd be found out
on their Scouters in no time.
But...
...why would you go to such lengths?
It's not like a Saiyan man
to worry about his children.
Maybe it's because I'm always
in the middle of a battle,
and I'd like to save something instead
for once.
Especially someone deemed to be
a lower-class warrior,
my son.
I've programmed in a distant planet
named Earth.
It's a world inhabited by people
with lower technology and combat levels.
I think even you'll be able
to survive there.
Moreover, it's not of much worth,
so the chances that it will be targeted
by Frieza are also low.
If Bardock is overthinking the matter,
we'll come
and get you right away, okay?
Listen, you survive, no matter what!
We'll see you later!
Bye.
Kakarot!
Without the Saiyans,
our fighting force will be cut in half.
Even at that,
we will still be able to get by.
They have no choice
but to pretend to be submissive,
but they may bare their fangs
at any time.
Oh?
They are, after all, a warrior race.
One must sweep the dust away
before it can be stirred up.
I feel much better now.
What was that?
What's wrong?
A message from the Frieza force.
A meteor collided with Planet Vegeta...
It was obliterated!
What?
Then most of the Saiyans
were wiped out?
Why didn't they detect
the meteor approaching?
We're lucky, aren't we? Ignoring
Frieza's order to gather like that?
I never got to be King Vegeta.
Vegeta, you have a brother, don't you?
Come to think of it,
what became of him?
Not that I'm interested.
Raditz, you had
a younger brother, too, right?
He was determined
to be a lower-class warrior,
so he was
in a home child-rearing capsule.
Disgraceful.
Hmm? My mother contacted me
saying he was sent off in a pod.
It doesn't matter to me, though.
PRESENT DAY
Mmm, delicious!
Ah, the food! The air!
This cottage really is beyond terrific!
Right, Bulma-San?
Nice, isn't it?
We had it built many years ago.
Out here on this unoccupied island,
1,600 kilometres south of Metro West,
they can cut loose a little
and still be fine.
They're likely to destroy Metro West
before long otherwise.
Keep it down!
Stop fighting so loud!
By the way, Goku-San...
Why do you seek
even greater strength?
Is it because you are after
the position of Destroyer?
What was that?
I can't let that slide.
No, it ain't.
I don't wanna be anything like that.
"That" was over the line.
When I saw how ridiculously strong
the guys in other universes were
in that all-universe tournament earlier,
it got me fired...
...up!
You mean your sights
are already set on other universes?
You're as big a buffoon as ever.
Then Vegeta-San, why do you seek
for even greater strength?
Frieza!
This idiot right here
decided to bring that devil
of all people back to life, that's why!
Hey, if it wasn't for Frieza,
our 7th Universe might not still be here.
Oh, is that right?
Yeah. He helped save us.
Idiot! He was only thinking
of himself in doing so.
You saw Frieza when he came
to Earth before, remember?
He accomplished that much
in that short amount of time.
You're saying he might get even
more powerful and come to defeat us?
No doubt about it.
I don't know. Even though
we brought him back to life?
You idiot! Do you think
he feels obligated to us?
How many times
are you gonna call me an idiot?
As often as I want to, idiot!
Hmm? It's Trunks.
What is it?
It looks like a burglar
broke into your lab.
Huh? What was stolen?
I'll check the security video.
Let's see...
The Dragon Balls that you collected
and the Dragon Radar.
They took what?
Like I told you, you need better security.
You know what, Mama?
The burglars that show up...
...they were wearing clothes
like Papa's.
Huh?
Thank you, Trunks.
The culprits are Frieza's men.
He deliberately used some men
with lower battle powers
so we wouldn't notice them.
Frieza sure is relentless
in going after the Dragon Balls.
I wonder what sort of wish
he could have at this point.
He ain't able to wish for anything
beyond Shen Long's power,
so wishing to be made the strongest
in the universe is out.
That should be obvious,
his wish is to never die.
Yeah, but, not dying is pointless
if you still lose.
Even so, there's a chance
that someday he'll surpass us!
There is?
I had six of the Dragon Balls.
They're sure to go where
the last one is to find it.
Where is it?
The ice continent.
I don't like the cold,
so I was putting off going to get it.
The ice continent?
Would you like to come, too?
I'm taking a nap.
Oh, my, does that not sound like fun?
Anything good to eat there?
I wouldn't count on it.
Then count me out.
Terrific! Then here,
look after Bra.
Thank you!
Hey! Why, you...!
The ice continent is cold.
We'll have to buy
some cold-weather gear on the way.
Why were you collecting
the Dragon Balls?
Never you mind.
Tell me!
I was going to make myself younger.
About five years' worth.
You were gonna use the Dragon Balls
for something that unimportant?
You hush!
You Saiyans wouldn't understand!
Why only five years?
Why not any longer?
It would seem unnatural to become
young again all at once, right?
I'm sure people would say,
"Oh? Bulma-San, you suddenly
look young again, don't you?
"I wonder,
have you had some work done?"
And so forth.
Hold on. You've already been using
the Dragon Balls from time to time, huh?
Frieza-sama,
along with the Dragon Radar,
Vegeta's wife was already in possession
of six of the Dragon Balls,
so they obtained them,
and they are now heading to the site
of the last one to locate it.
That is marvellous news.
So, shall we start up the ship
and head for Earth?
No, we can do that once they find
all seven Dragon Balls.
It would be dangerous to rush there
and arrive too early.
Even without Scouters, they can tell
if a high battle power is approaching.
Understood.
You have written down
how to make the wish, yes?
Yes, to the letter.
By the way...
What is it, Kikono?
Nothing... just... once
the Dragon Balls are gathered,
I was wondering, Frieza-sama,
what sort of wish would you be making?
Would it be to have an immortal body,
as you have mentioned before?
No, it would not.
Huh?
I realised something
when I was in Earth's hell
and rendered unable to move
that not being able to either die or move
was nothing but misery.
Then... perhaps,
to not ever take any damage...
or something?
That would make the game
no fun to play.
Hmm... What could it be?
You will never guess.
You wish to increase
your height, correct?
Huh? Berryblue-San!
How could you say that?
There are so many soldiers
who have called Frieza-sama
a "pipsqueak" behind his back
who have been eliminated, after all.
Well deduced, Berryblue-San.
You are correct.
Huh?
That was the right answer?
Can you promise not to tell anyone?
Of course!
I would like...
...to grow by about five centimetres.
Huh?
Then, if you adopted
your second transformation,
would that not be sufficiently tall?
Oh, no! I wish to be taller
in my regular and final forms.
Then, why only a mere five centimetres?
It would seem unnatural to become
tall all at once, right?
I want it to look like I am still growing.
I see...
There's nobody around here.
There just aren't that many folks
with a battle power of at least 1,000.
What choice do we have?
Our orders were to go find
as many combatants as we could
to rebuild the force.
There already were a bunch
of combatants, weren't there?
Rumour has it that they were
fighting too timidly,
so Frieza-sama killed them all.
Cheelai, why did you join
the Frieza force?
It got out that I stole
a Galactic Patrol spaceship.
They can't touch me
if I'm in the Frieza force, right?
You're scum.
Yeah, well...
Lemo-San, you've been in the Frieza
force the whole time, right?
Have you ever met Frieza-sama?
I'm not a combatant.
I've only ever seen him on the station.
I hear he's teeny.
Don't ever say anything like that again.
Not if you want to live.
All right.
He's killed some people before
just for having bad breath.
Still, if he's putting women
and old men to work,
the Frieza force might have
just about had it, huh?
What's that?
A distress signal!
What's more, it's an awfully
old type of Frieza force signal.
It's coming from that world over there.
If we rescue them,
we may get a special bonus.
All right, let's get down there!
There's no one here.
There, you see?
I'll try using my Scouter.
Are you the Frieza force?
Is that a tail?
You mean, you're a Saiyan?
"Saiyan"?
Yeah. I'm Paragus.
I'm a Frieza force Saiyan.
So that distress signal...
Yeah, that was me.
My spaceship broke down.
I've waited an unbelievably long time,
and now, I'm saved!
Battle power 4,200. Great.
Are you alone?
No, there's one other...
Broly!
This is my son, Broly.
No way!
What?
His battle power is... beyond measure!
Hmm? Ridiculous.
That's not possible...
Hop in! Frieza-sama will be delighted!
Let's see...
What was your name again?
Broly.
You want one of these, Broly?
They're good. Here.
You have to unwrap it first!
Eat it, Broly.
Well? It's good, right?
What, not even a thank you?
Tell her thanks, Broly.
Thank you... very much.
That's formal.
Just "thank you" is fine.
Thank you?
Sure!
I have brought them, Frieza-sama.
Oh...
Are you really a Saiyan?
You do not appear to have a tail.
No, sir.
The effects of transforming
into a Great Ape, which is a Saiyan trait,
caused him to lose all sense of himself.
Which is why I cut off his tail.
Has he lost his sense of himself since?
Yes, sir, on rare occasions.
So you are saying that it does
sometimes still happen?
Please do not worry.
When that happens...
...using this remote control, electricity
runs through the device around Broly's neck.
It is not a strong current,
but it allows me to control him.
I see.
What is your name?
It is Broly, sir.
I see you still have a tremendous level
of yet-untapped battle power.
I am certain that he can be
of great use to you, Frieza-sama.
This is indeed an unexpected bounty.
Berryblue-San, please offer a reward
to the two who found him.
This much?
Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!
I understand that you were unable
to escape from that barren planet
for quite a long time.
Yes, sir.
Are you aware that your home world
of Planet Vegeta is no longer there?
Yes, sir. I heard so on the way here.
But none of that matters now.
It's just...
Vengeance, yes?
Paragus-San, did you know
that King Vegeta's son, Vegeta IV,
is still alive?
What?
Prince Vegeta?
Why... that miserable Vegeta!
Allow me to lend you some assistance
with your vengeance.
Berryblue-San, once these two
have had a shower,
please arrange for some
battle uniforms for them.
Yes, sir.
I had not meant to fight this time,
but now...
This is starting to get interesting.
Yo!
You're looking freshly scrubbed,
aren't you?
Come eat with us.
Broly, where's your battle uniform?
It's... hard to move in it.
It's not once you put it on.
Do whatever you like, though.
But get rid of that fur around your waist.
It's dirty, and it stinks.
No!
Oh, so it's something important to you.
This... is my...
Broly, we're here to eat,
not to talk.
You can at least let him
talk that much, can't you?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't butt in.
Huh?
Now, now...
Hey, are you new?
It can't be any fun hanging out
with this sour bunch.
I'm the only combatant aboard
this ship for this operation
who's any good.
Come on over with me.
Let go of me!
I told you no, didn't I?
How about if I buy you a drink?
Shut up, old man!
Stop, Broly!
What do you want?
You got a problem with me?
I do.
What did you say?
What? Damn it! Damn it!
Broly!
Are you okay?
You! You went too far!
How could you do that to him?
If I hadn't stopped him,
he might have killed him.
Just how did you raise him?
While we are in your debt,
we don't seem to see eye to eye.
From now on, please do not
come near my son.
Paragus-San, Frieza-sama
is calling for you.
Frieza-sama? Yes, we will
come right away. Broly!
No, just you, Paragus-San.
Huh? Oh, I see.
Broly, I'll be right back. Wait here.
My dead creep of a father
might be better than this guy.
Huh?
Oh, you swiped that?
This is what I think of this thing!
Broly, thank you for earlier.
Oh, you want some water?
Let me have that.
Here.
What is this?
Huh? It's ordinary water.
Haven't you ever had water before?
That was good.
This is Ba's ear.
Oh, you mean the fur?
Me and Ba got along well.
Ba is a big, big, beast,
bigger than this ship.
"Ba" is the sound Ba made,
so that's what I called Ba.
Ba was scary,
but day after day, while doing
training by dodging Ba's attacks,
we became friends.
We became good friends.
So Ba was the first friend
you ever made.
But Dad was angry.
Being friends with Ba isn't training.
So then...
...Dad shot Ba's ear with a gun,
making Ba angry.
Ba never became friends
with me again.
That's why I decided to stay
with Ba's ear.
You sure talked a lot, Broly.
This is the first time I've ever heard
such a pure story around here.
You seriously are innocent.
I'll bet you don't even like to fight,
do you?
You just had an incredible gift
for rough-and-tumble fighting,
so your old man forced you
to train, didn't he?
That father of yours!
He only thinks of you
as a powerful weapon, doesn't he?
One used for vengeance
and getting ahead.
Probably.
Your old man is the worst.
You don't have to do everything
that guy tells you.
It's not right for you
to say bad things about Dad.
It should be around here somewhere...
You idiot!
Hurry and pull me up!
Sorry!
Found it! I found it!
The planet called Earth
to which we are about to go
will have Vegeta
and one other Saiyan.
I would like to see Broly-san's power.
The innate strength that Broly possesses
is super-prodigious.
We will achieve
our long-sought vengeance!
Incidentally, you are free to do
with Vegeta whatever you wish.
But please allow me to finish off
the other Saiyan named Son Goku.
Killing Son Goku has long been
a dream of mine, you see!
As you wish.
Frieza-sama, we have collected
all seven Dragon Balls!
Oh, that is outstanding!
Down there! Frieza's men!
They've already found the last one?
That aircraft looks like trouble,
doesn't it?
Could those be the Saiyans
that Kikono-sama warned us about?
Whoo! Now this is cold!
Whis-San, I'm surprised
it doesn't bother you.
The vacuum of space is even colder.
Yikes!
The Scouter's readings just spiked!
It's the Saiyans!
We're getting out of here!
Hey, you! Come on out
and give back the Dragon Balls!
What do we do?
What do we do?
If we don't give them back, he'll kill us.
If we do give them back,
Frieza-sama will kill us!
Well, well,
here comes Frieza's entrance.
Hmm? What's that?
It ain't just Frieza.
There's some other
out-of-this-world guy in there.
Those are Saiyans, aren't they?
Vegeta! There's no doubt about it.
He looks just like the king.
What are you doing here, Frieza?
I am sure you already know.
Having a wish granted
by the Dragon Balls.
What are those ball-like things?
Beats me.
Go ask someone.
Hey! Go get the Dragon Balls back!
It appears
that we have a larger problem.
I suppose you might call it
the nature of their warrior race.
Frieza, who are those two?
These are the newest enlistees
to the Frieza force,
Broly-San and his father...
Paragus!
There you have it. As you appear to have
noticed, they, like you, are Saiyans.
I don't know them.
I understand that when you were
quite little, your father, King Vegeta,
did a terrible disservice
to Paragus-San and Broly-San here,
and up until now, they were trapped
on an unfamiliar, inimical world.
Frieza!
What's "inimical"?
It means "beyond severe".
Thanks.
You idiot!
I swear that you, at least,
will pay for that, Vegeta!
We are here to take revenge!
Don't be ridiculous!
How is that any of my affair?
He ain't got nothing to do with that!
We're all Saiyans here.
Let's just get along.
Frieza-sama?
He appears unable to wait.
Very well.
Please show me what he has.
Understood, sir.
All right! Broly!
Do it!
You're not bad, huh?
I'm finally starting to warm up!
He's fast!
He must have studied
how to use his power.
It looks like Vegeta
is fairly well-trained, too.
They have been through
their own share of battles, after all.
Moreover, your son seems
yet unaccustomed to this.
Broly-San has never fought
another person, correct?
Only simulated fights with me.
Fighting against someone of your
battle power is all but meaningless.
Not to worry.
He is steadily becoming
more familiar with it.
Good, Broly!
You're a real pest!
What is that?
Oh, is Broly-San not able
to turn Super Saiyan?
Super Saiyan? You don't mean...
...like the legend?
What's with this guy?
He's quick to develop!
He's awesome! He's starting
to hold his own in his base form!
I never imagined that Vegeta
had improved so much.
Oh, has he reached his limit already?
Yes, sir.
Oh, very well.
Perhaps we should call it a day.
Yes, sir.
What is this?
No! Broly!
That's enough for now!
Stop! Come back!
It's gone!
My remote control is gone!
Oh, no!
Broly! I told you to stop!
Didn't you hear what I said?
This is worthless.
Stop, Vegeta!
No way... What?
Have you ever seen a Saiyan
like this before?
Hey, did you bring
any Senzu beans, Kakarot?
No, I didn't!
This is no time to be playing around.
If that had hit the ground...
Vegeta!
What is that?
That...?
He seems to have become able
to transform and take on the power
that Saiyans have
when becoming Great Apes,
without a Great Ape's lumbering moves,
by remaining in his humanoid form.
Is there some issue with it?
The thing is...
...he cannot even control it himself.
Hey, you!
I think it's about time you fought me.
Hey, calm down!
We all live in peace
here on the Earth!
Well, a lot... has happened,
but still...
Whatever the case,
you ain't a bad guy.
I can tell.
Stop doing this. You don't have to listen
to what those bad guys say.
Frieza-sama, is it okay
if we back off a little?
That would seem to be for the best.
We will take charge
of the Dragon Balls!
We are now free to watch
your son's exploits without reservation.
That guy is that phenomenal?
Still, this...
...isn't right.
Yeah.
It's because of his old man.
Yeah.
This is the result of him
taking that sweet Broly
and raising him to be the kind of warrior
that he wants him to be.
And now he's snapped.
I really feel sorry for the guy.
Oh, if this keeps up...
...my Broly will be killed!
Oh, it's all over!
Well, well, it appears the great
Frieza-sama may not get a chance.
Son!
What's happened?
That isn't just Frieza's Ki.
Yeah, you're right...
Sounds like you have your hands full.
You got that right.
It's a tremendous Ki.
Even if I went there,
I'd just be in the way.
Just stand by there for me.
If things get out of hand, I'll use
Instantaneous Movement to head there.
If you're saying something like that,
this must be some foe, all right.
Later.
Perhaps what King Vegeta said...
...was true.
Are you sure that he really has
nothing more this time?
Yes, sir...
I see.
Shall we put that to the test?
Ahem.
Broly-San! Look at this!
Broly-San!
Your father has been killed!
Yes! I succeeded!
Very nice.
That was the expression
I was waiting for.
What are you dawdling around for?
Idiot!
This is no time to insist
on fighting one-on-one, right?
I hate to admit it,
but it looks like you're right.
Let's go, Vegeta!
Damn it all!
Gyallic Ho!
Kamehame...
Ha!
Just a moment! I am Frieza!
Vegeta! Now! Over here!
What?
Hey, what in the world is going on?
Let go of me!
Hurry! I'll explain later.
Piccolo. Got any Senzu?
No, I don't.
Hey, Vegeta,
do you know the technique
called Fusion?
Fusion? Yeah, now that you mention it,
Trunks said something about it.
Hmm? That technique where you do
absurd moves and merge together?
Yeah, we're gonna do "Fu-sion"!
Don't be ridiculous!
As if I'd ever merge myself... with you!
It's just for 30 minutes!
We've joined together before
with the potara earrings, didn't we?
We ain't got potaras here,
so Fusion is the only way to beat him!
Even if we have no choice
but to merge together
are you telling me to do these,
these, and these moves?
It's the only way to win!
The Earth could be done for!
Then that's just fate.
You're okay with letting
your beloved Bulma die?
Don't try to embarrass me into it!
All right.
Hurry up and teach it to me!
You dare to push me...
...to these lengths, do you?
Then I will teach you a lesson
in the force of Golden Frieza!
Fu... sion!
What an embarrassing pose!
This is Fusion. We ain't got any time.
Come on, let's practice!
What's wrong, Vegeta?
I'd rather be dead...
Fu... sion!
Nobody's stronger than me now!
No good! Your fingers didn't match up!
Try it again in 30 minutes!
Fu... sion!
Absolutely wrong!
Your two angles were slightly off!
Another 30 minutes!
Fu... sion!
Good! Now, get out there
and defeat him...
What do I call you?
Huh?
Using potaras,
it was "Vegetto", wasn't it?
Okay then...
Forget it! Hurry and go!
I can't do that. Having a name
would sound cooler, to be sure.
This time it'll be...
...Gogeta!
Wonderful!
What wonderful battle power!
Who are you?
I am Gogeta!
Goku and Vegeta have merged together!
Merged?
You've been dead for a long time,
so you wouldn't know.
Their two strengths
are not just added together,
they're significantly greater.
That is not fair!
You're a fine one to be saying that.
Over here!
Oh, my.
Whis-San, let me take it from here!
You two can merge together, I see.
Ah, it's that Fusion thing!
Come on!
Now it's my turn!
Broly is going to be finished
at this rate!
He's been turned into nothing but a
fighting machine, thanks to his father.
He isn't fighting
because he wants to fight!
Broly is actually
a pure, kind-hearted Saiyan!
We can't let him die!
I shall grant thee any one wish.
So, now what do we do?
Hurry up and tell me!
Forget it, I'm shooting.
All right! I'll tell you!
"Just say the wish as is."
Oh, is that all?
My wish is...
Magnificent!
This might bring this to a close.
Ka...
...me...
...ha...
...me...
Send Broly back to the planet
where he was before!
Your wish has been granted.
Farewell!
Get in, Cheelai!
Whoa, there!
I will be back, understand?
It looks like it turned out all right.
Sorry to get you mixed up in all that.
Don't worry about it. That was the most
thrilling and enjoyable time I've had
since I joined the Frieza force.
Think they'll come after us?
Who knows?
So, Cheelai,
where are you planning on going?
To Broly's world.
Vampa, huh?
What world
should I let you off on, Lemo?
Nah, I'll tag along with you.
The risk is the same no matter where I go.
Being near the mighty Broly
will put me at ease.
In that case, we'll have to stop along
the way to buy some food and stuff.
THREE DAYS LATER
Sure enough, it appears
that those two are together with Broly.
Let us leave them alone for a while.
We will allow them to bring
Broly's mind under control,
and once he can release
that immense power
without losing his sense of self,
that is when he will become
the mightiest combatant.
Do you think that will work?
I certainly hope that it does.
No matter how hard I try
to raise my battle power,
my foes are still
both Son Goku and Vegeta.
I would like to have one other, as well.
PLANETOID VAMPA
You're kidding, right?
This is what you've been eating?
Well, it's bitter, but it's better
than starving to death... I guess.
Count me out.
Don't ask for too much.
We won't last even 50 days
on just the food we bought.
Somebody's here.
Huh?
Hey, can I come in?
Huh? Who are you guys?
You! You're the Saiyan from Earth!
Oh, right! You're the ones from the Frieza
force who used the Dragon Balls!
What are you doing here?
You guys are Broly's friends?
I asked you what you were doing here!
Now, don't lose your temper.
I ain't here to fight, okay?
Then, why are you here?
I heard your world was awful,
so I brought you some stuff.
Who asked you to? Go away.
You can't trick us.
I asked someone named Bulma,
and got this for you.
Could you stand back?
There's food and water and a bunch
of other stuff inside the house.
Also, these are called Senzu beans.
I'm giving you two of them.
Eat one whenever you think,
"Yikes, I'm gonna die!"
They don't work against illnesses,
but they completely heal injuries,
and restore your strength to full, too.
What are you plotting?
It ain't like that.
I just want you to live healthy.
Huh?
Huh?
I was so sure of my own strength,
but then the much stronger Broly
showed up.
And what's more, he's a Saiyan,
too, just like me.
He's probably even stronger
than Beerus-sama.
Beerus-sama is this god, you see.
Goodness.
Anyways, it would be a shame
to let someone so incredible...
...up and die, right?
Well, whatever.
Just take care of yourselves.
Bye.
Huh? There's no ship.
How did you get here?
I can do Instantaneous Movement.
I just searched for Broly's Ki.
I really don't get anything
you're telling us.
Is it okay if I come again?
Just so you know,
you're our enemy, understand?
We may be out of the Frieza force,
but we're not becoming friends
with you.
Doesn't matter to me either way.
Huh?
I just want you to let me
come fight Broly once in a while.
Huh?
Huh?
There's some stuff
I'd like to teach him, too.
You sure do seem to be pretty crazy.
How come?
Well, anyway, I should offer my gratitude.
Thank you.
Yeah. Bye now.
I'll be back again.
We may not be here when you do.
That's okay. As long as you ain't
too far away, I can find you.
What's your name?
Son Goku. Also...
...Kakarot.
