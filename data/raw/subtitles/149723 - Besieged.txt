Who can tell me the difference
between a leader and a boss?
Now, let me show you
how a boss walks.
Doesn't stop.
Doesn't care who's on his way.
Even turning is like...
so perfect...
Winston!
Thank you.
It was... it was most kind.
I mean, it was very thoughtful of you
to mend the hem of my trousers.
It's part of my work,
Mr. Kinsky.
Well, thank you all the same.
Good night.
Good night.
Morning, Shandurai.
Good morning, Mr. Kinsky.
I don' t think he has any friends.
He had this rich aunt...
You'll end up in bed with him.
So then, come to bed with me.
Anyway, you are always
telling me you are gay.
Exactly.
You're the only woman
in the world I could sleep with.
I'm going home.
I have an exam soon,
Agostino, you know?
Me, too.
Well, it's important to me,
and this is a waste of time!
This is my cabinet!
I think this is yours.
It belonged to my aunt.
I do not understand you!
I don't understand this music.
I rather hoped
you might keep it.
It's not possible I keep this.
You know?
Why?
Why do I keep this?
I love you.
I absolutely...
Look, I'm in love with you.
I'm sorry.
I think I should go.
Marry me!
- Marry you?
- Marry me, yes! Please.
I cannot marry you.
Marry me.
You're crazy.
I've never felt anything
like this before. I' ve never...
I've never said such things.
I love you.
We could go anywhere.
I'll go anywhere with you.
We could go to Africa.
- Africa?
- Yes, yes.
What do you know about Africa?
What do you know?
Let me go.
Please, love me.
Please, love me!
I' ll do anything.
What do I have to do to make you love me?
I' ll do anything!
I'll do anything!
You get my husband out of jail!
I'm sorry. I didn' t realise
you were married.
May I ask you why he's in jail?
Are you all right?
I believe this is yours.
Sorry.
Uh, it just slipped.
He said to the disciples...
"People were
eating and drinking...
"buying and selling...
"planting and building...
"but the day Lot left Sodom...
"it rained fire
and brimstone from heaven...
"and it destroyed them all.
"Anyone who tries
to preserve his life...
"will lose it.
"And anyone who loses it...
"will be kept safe."
You want coffee?
Something?
No, no, no.
I don't think so.
Thank you all the same.
I have to go out for the day.
Someone's coming to collect the
tapestry from the music room...
so if you could just show them
where it is.
I suppose
they'll need the ladder.
Coming.
Oh, no, I clean later.
No, no.
Please, please, please.
Shandurai,
could you please pass me...
some of the manuscript paper
over there?
Thank you.
There's not much to dust now.
Yes. I know.
The carpet could do
with some hoovering, though.
You sure I don't disturb you?
No.
Go ahead.
The bookcase.
Uh, I'll get it.
Father!
Yes!
You're here?
Well, uh...
Carry on, carry on.
Well, wonderful, wonderful.
Where?
I'll see you in one minute.
I must go out.
"My dear Shandurai..."
"Good news of your husband.
"He is alive."
"He is being transferred...
"from the military jail..."
"to an ordinary prison...
"and his trial has been set
for next week.
Who is this?
Why?
- Found you.
- Agostino.
- Let me in.
- No, no, no.
- Please, let me in.
- What are you doing here?
Let me in. Please, please, please.
Let me in.
He's good, your pianist.
I can be a student for the rest
of my life. Why not?
Was it so bad?
Dreadful.
They were really homophobic.
Let's get drunk.
Where is the whiskey,
the cognac?
No, let go of me!
What?
Where?
You OK, Mr. Kinsky?
Yes, I'm fine.
Are you sure?
It's just... you seem...
Seem what?
Maybe something
I can do for you, hey?
No, thank you.
Well, as a matter of fact, um...
I'll be giving a small concert
next Friday for some friends.
Perhaps you could arrange
to be there to help.
Yes, of course.
I'll be performing
a little piece I composed.
You'll probably find it
rather... trivial.
What is it?
Mr. Kinsky,
I want to ask you something.
I wanted to ask you if, uh...
What?
There's this friend of mine...
and it's his birthday
on Friday...
so I wanted
to give him a present...
and I thought that maybe
he could be at your concert.
Yes, of course.
The one who was making
so much noise.
I meant to say sorry.
I didn't know
he was coming, and...
he was very, very drunk
'cause he failed his exam...
and I said, "zitto, zitto,
quiet," but he still...
He's not my boyfriend!
Shandurai, where are you going?
My husband.
"Freedom. Arriving Sunday
at dawn. Winston."
We must give him a big party.
You'll make love for a week.
You get a baby, yes?
Aren't you happy, Shandurai?
- I don't know.
- Why?
Come in.
An incredible thing
has happened.
I heard from my husband...
and he is alive.
He's been freed.
He's free.
Well, that's marvelous news.
You must be very happy.
I wanted to ask you if...
it would be OK that Winston...
stays with me downstairs
for a few days.
Of course, of course.
When is he arriving?
Very early tomorrow morning.
Well, that's very exciting
for you.
He's a brave man, you know.
He's a good man.
I respect him very much.
I found the ball.
Look forward to meeting him.
To our Lord, who once again
has given us proof of his mercy.
And to you, for your...
for your kindness, your help...
and your tenacity.
I hope one day you'll invite me
to one of your concerts.
I don't really give concerts.
What?
I don't play in public.
Why not?
Well...
One of the finest pianists
of our day, Vladimir Horowitz...
he stopped playing
at the peak of his career.
Became convinced that his...
his fingers were made of glass.
Each time he struck...
he was terrified that the finger
might just shatter.
Franco Ferarro,
wonderful Italian conductor.
Every time he mounted
the podium...
he sensed this terrible little...,
this terrible force...
pushing him backwards.
He just...
fainted away,
just fainted every time.
You faint?
- No. - That is why
you don't give concerts.
I don't... I don't faint.
- No, no, no, no, I've had enough.
- Yes. Yes.
Oh, well.
We've all had enough.
Now, what about you?
Why don't you play in public?
Me?
I'm just not good enough.
