Greetings.
[ In English ]: You saved our lives,

[ In Arabic ]:
Thank you. l only did my duty.

You speak our language.
Then you will understand
that l do not wish to be
indebted to a Christian.
[ Horse neighs ]
God truly moves
in mysterious ways.
Only He knows why He sent
an enemy to our rescue.
You could have killed us
as easily as you killed the bandits.
Those bandits
have robbed many pilgrims,

to protect pilgrims.
[ In Arabic ]:
Take not another's life.
lt is sacred in the eyes of God.
ALL:
Save in the cause of righteousness.
[ In English ]:
Al Ghouti, l have heard of you.
You are a great warrior.
l am Yussuf.
This is my brother Fahkr.
We are merchants
on our way to Cairo.
AL GHOUTl: Taking this way around
the Dead Sea without an escort.
This is the shortest route.
But not the safest.
We've sworn not to raise arms
against each other,
so let us be honest:
you are warriors like us.
[ In Arabic ]:
Leave us.

Do you know who l am?
You are Yussuf
Salah al-Din Ayyubi,
the one we know as Saladin.
And you are not afraid?
You have given me your word,

You are a man of honor,
not like your brothers.
How is it
that you speak our language?
l've been here many years.
And you do not wish
to return home?

Hi.
MOTHER RIKISSA:
Cecilia!
Yes, Mother.
ARN:
l have.. .
Unburden yourself, my son.
l have...
l have disobeyed
and ventured outside
the monastery grounds.
There was a girl singing,
and she spoke to me, Father.
That is the end
of your confession, my son?
All thy sins l thee forgive.
Ego te absolvo.
ln the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
Sit.
[ Sighs ]
Arn, listen.
You did nothing wrong.
You've grown up now.
Sooner or later
you have to experience
the life outside these walls.
The world outside, Father --
l know so little of it.
Yes, yes.
Well, you better get used to it.
lt was your mother's will --
and God's --
that you should be brought up
here in the monastery.
Father Henri.
filia mea.
She and your father
had promised you as a child to God.
She said it was the will of God.
You had been sick,
so they prayed for your life,
and God granted them a miracle.
So the promise
was a sacred trust.
We cannot oppose
the will of God.
But l'm reluctant to raise a child
to become a monk.
But who says that God sent
the boy here to become a monk?
[ Birds chirping ]
[ In French ]
You want to try?
Okay? Here.
[ In English ]:
Hold it tight.
And now...
Aim.
And now try to hit the target.
Very good!
Good. Again.
Good. Again.
[ Chuckling ]:
Very good. Oh.
Hey, look!
l told you --
always in my eye.
[ Laughs ]
Go!
Arn?
Hey!
You see?
ARN:
Omnis scientiae fundamentum.
FRIAR: Mm-hmm. ''To read
is the foundation of all knowledge.''
What?
ln which hand does it feel
most comfortable, hmm?
Both?
[ Chuckles ]
Oh!
Careful, your foot!
[ Laughs ]
Frère Guilbert,
why are you so good at fighting?
Once l used to be much better.
Again.
FATHER HENRl: You seem
to be training him to be a warrior.
ls that entirely wise?
l am merely
strengthening the skills
that God has already given him.
l wasn't sure that you were ready,
but you are now.
You must do the Lord's calling.
Brother Guilbert and l
have discussed this,
and we have reached a decision.
The time has come
for you to go home, Arn.
You must go back to your family.
''ln hoc signo vinces.''
''ln this sign
thou shalt conquer.''
Before l came here,
to this, uh, peaceful monastery,
l served another order.
God's holy army,
the Knights Templar.
For 1 2 years,
l fought with this sword
in the Holy Land.
With this sword,
no one has ever defeated me.
You may never draw it in anger
or use it for your own gain.
lt has to serve God's good cause.
ULVBANE: [ In Swedish ]:
Your livestock is grazing on my land.
Are you not aware
of the boundaries?
ESKIL: l know
where my livestock may graze.
FOLKESSON:
That land is not yours.
ULVBANE: Have you no honor?
Are you a bald-faced liar?
ESKIL: Liar? You are the one
to stretch the truth!
FOLKESSON: The land at Forsvik
has always belonged to our clan.
And many a man
can swear to that fact.
We'll see what the Council of Elders
has to say about that.
See you there... liar!
And who may you be?!
Eskil.
Father.
Arn?
What the devil?
[ Chuckles ]
l didn't recognize you.
lt's good to have you back.
Magnus.
Brosa.
Eskil.
Arn.
-Good to see you back at Arnäs.
-You haven't changed, Uncle Brosa.
Those monks had you for years.
Were you taught to read?
l see, so you can read.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Now to the land dispute
between Magnus Folkesson
and Emund Ulvbane.
l understand that Magnus Folkesson
is willing to settle.
That is the case.
And l am willing to pay
Emund Ulvbane
the sum of 30 pieces of silver.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
That is more than one could ask.
For peace between neighbors
is worth far more than silver.
The settlement has been accepted.
As the Council has ruled,
l must comply.
But 'tis a shame that silver
outweighs honor and truth.
'Tis also a shame to be obliged
to deal with a man without honor.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
You, Magnus Folkesson...
You are not a man.
And your sons are no better.
They are but puny girls,
a nun and a beer keg.
[ Laughter ]
[ Coins clink ]
BROSA: Mark my words,
the Sverker King planned this.
He whispered those insults
in Ulvbane's ear.
Ulvbane knew every word
to the letter!
The Sverker clan
wants to weaken us.
l wish there were a way out.
But a public insult must by law
be redressed through single combat.
ls there no other way?
l will do battle with him tomorrow.
May the Lord protect me.
Do not despair.
They haven't buried me yet.
[ Chuckles ]
Let the combatants step forward.
G U l LBE RT, VOlCE-OVE R:
This sword is a blessed sword.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
Arn!
BROSA: It's too late.
He has accepted the challenge.
Am l to fight a nun?
[ Laughter ]
l never figured your father
to be such a coward.
[ Thud ]
Aaah!
[ Crowd murmuring, laughing ]
-MAN: Death to the Sverker!
-Cut him down, Arn! Kill him!
CROWD:
Kill, kill, kill!
Arn!
Aah!
[ Grunts ]
[ Crowd shouting ]
[ Shouting stops ]
[ Crowd shouting triumphantly ]
Arn, Algot Pålsson is here.
He's brought his daughter along.
lt's Cecilia.
Welcome, Algot.
What brings you here?
We were nearby, so...
l -- l just wanted to see the place.
lt's been so long
since l've been here.
My father doesn't like me
riding alone.
That's why the groom is here.
l see.
People are certainly
talking about you.
Really?
Yes, everyone is talking about
how you saved your family's honor.
lt really wasn't anything.
l mean --
Well, people talk too much.
What do you mean?
l had no choice
but to defend my father.
Come on.
Catch me if you can!
[ Woman vocalizing softly ]
Ohh!
[ Horse whinnies ]
Arn!
[ Panting ]
Arn!
Boo!
[ Both laughing ]
[ Laughing ]:
Stop!
[ Both laugh ]
You have stolen...
What did you say?
What did you say?
You have stolen my heart.
You have stolen my heart
with one glance of your eyes.
l do believe you have stolen mine,
Arn Magnusson.
Brosa.
What's wrong?
We've spoken to Algot.
He says you ran off
with his youngest daughter.
She is promised to a Sverker.
lt's unwise to give her ideas.
FOLKESSON: Her father
owes a debt to the Sverkers.
Yes, and they are angered
by Ulvbane's defeat,
though you spared his life.
We cannot risk
any more trouble now!
Algot cannot give his daughter
to an enemy of the King.
[ Birds chirping ]
ALGOT:
Cecilia?
Cecilia!
l don't want a Sverker.
l want to belong to you, Arn.
CECILIA: The Virgin Mother
is on our side.
Nothing can keep us apart.
My dear sister,
l have something to tell you.
[ Laughs ]
l am betrothed to Arn Magnusson.
What's the matter?
l knew it.
Knew what?
Father cannot afford
to pay for two weddings.
l'll never leave this place.
Don't say that!
We won't leave you here.
l apologize, Cecilia.
l'm happy for you.
Have you set a date
for your wedding?
No date has been set.
But it will have to be soon.
You're the only one l'm telling,
so promise you'll keep my secret.
l'm carrying his child.
Are you absolutely sure of this?
KATARl NA:
Yes.
And this is the same Arn Magnusson
who crippled Emund Ulvbane?
Yes, Mother Rikissa.
After the council,
they came to our farm.
ALGOT:
Welcome, Magnus!
The news from Axevalla
precedes you.
MAGNUS:
Algot.
ALGOT:
Arn!
Now you're the man of the hour.
And there's more.
That same night,
before he met Cecilia,
he had carnal knowledge of me.
[ Shivers ]
You do understand
that this will not be the end
of the matter, don't you?
''Most Reverend Lord Bishop,
lt is with a heavy heart
l write these words.
But in these times of trouble,
we of the Sverker clan
must stand united.
And so l am forced
to put pen to paper.
By way of a confession,
l obtained information
vital to our kinfolk
with regard to the young lad
who humiliated
the King's best fighter...
...the infamous Arn Magnusson.''
Here, in the diocese of Skara,
lives a young man
with an angelic face
and a black and sinful heart.
With fine words and false promises
he has enticed a young maiden
to indulge in sins of the flesh...
and caused her to be with child
out of wedlock.
But there is more.
This young man
has another wicked deed
on his conscience.
He had already lain
with the young maiden's sister.
That one man would take two sisters
is indeed an abomination.
Such a deed is not easily redeemed.
Arn Magnusson of Arnäs,
and Cecilia Algotsdotter
of Pål's Farm...
are, from this day forward,
excommunicated.
No clergyman in all of West Gothia
may have anything to do with them.
They are sentenced
to do penance...
...at the abbeys of Varnhem
and Gudhem
for half a lifetime -- 20 years.
[ Gasps, sobs ]
Cecilia!
Arn!
Cecilia.
No matter what they say,
l never laid with your sister.
l've never loved anyone else.
[ Sniffles ]
l swear by all that is holy
to come for you.
MOTHER RIKISSA:
Cecilia!
l will wait for you.
Cecilia Algotsdotter!
No, do not make me!
No!
[ Door closes ]
Prayer and work, Cecilia.
That's what lies ahead for you.
lf you imagine that your stay here
will be as comfortable
as things used to be,
you are sorely mistaken.
You are surrounded
by Sverkers now,
and you will do penance.
Look at me.
Look at me!
l will tame you,
Cecilia Algotsdotter.
FATHER HENRl:
Multi sunt vocati, pauci vero electi.
[ In English ]:
Guilty or not,
you have been convicted
of an abomination,
and no man can lift
that sentence.
But you will not stay here
at Varnhem.
l have written to the Bishop,
and he has agreed
to our request.
Under the name of Arn de Gothia,
you will journey first to Rome,
and from there,
to the Holy Land.
Father, l --
You will be a Knight Templar, Arn,
a soldier in the service of God.
[ Sighs ]
[ Door opens ]
[ In Swedish ]:
Daydreaming again?
l suppose you think
your beloved will come for you.
But that will never happen.
Arn Magnusson has been sent
to the Holy Land, to the Crusades.
That's a lie!
You'll never see him again.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
De Gothia.
[ In English ]:
Sir.
Back so soon? l trust you
have completed your mission.
l have, Grandmaster.
But l have bad news to report.
Oh?
Saladin is here.
What?!
He could march on Jerusalem
at any time.
This is not possible.
Saladin's troops are scattered
across the country.
Surely we would have
heard something
if he had assembled an army.
Gentlemen, Saladin is here,
and he's sure of his victory.
l have just spoken
with the King of Jerusalem.
His spies report
that Saladin is in Damascus.
ARN:
Not anymore.
Grandmaster, l don't know
what de Gothia hopes to achieve
by spreading these rumors.
Who told you this, de Gothia?
An eyewitness.
Who told you?
A man l trust.
So you saved Saladin's life,
and then you sat down
and shared his bread.
l gave him my word.
You gave him your word?
[ Scoffs ]
Now, what did you learn?
He was heading south.
That's where the attack
will come from.
l'll inform the King.
We must prepare for a siege.
Tell me, de Gothia,
what kind of man is he,
our enemy?
He's like us --
a man of his word.
SALADIN: l am glad that God
has given me this chance
to get to know my enemy.
You respect him.
That won't stop me
from fighting him, sir.
lt is a shame
that you must lose this war.
-l have sworn to win.
-So have l.
And we shall soon see
which one of us is right.

But because
you have saved my life,
l will be merciful.
Leave Jerusalem
without giving battle,
and you and your brother Templars
will have safe passage
wherever you wish.
My duty is to protect Jerusalem.
Even if the decision
was mine to make,
my answer would still be no.
Then you will die.
lt's all in the hands of God.
# Amen #
[ Exhales sharply ]
[ In Swedish ]:
Who are you?
l am your future queen.
l am betrothed to Knut Eriksson.
He will soon seize the crown
from the Sverker King.
And he will come for me soon.
Hopefully he will bring news
of the Crusades.
Arn.
Does anyone have news?
l know nothing of Arn.
But little Magnus is doing fine.
Magnus?
Your son.
Didn't they tell you?
You had no idea?
That vicious Sverker witch!
Magnus? Is that his name?
Oh! Thank you!
He's alive!
[ In English ]: The King of Jerusalem
sends his blessings.
The True Cross.
Thank you, de Ridefort.
We appreciate the King's kindness
and we'll need its protection
since Saladin is already
on his way to Jerusalem.
Grandmaster Torroja.
The battle for Jerusalem does not
have to be fought at Jerusalem.
What do you mean?
Saladin's army is great,
but that also means
that it moves slowly.
Which gives us time
to prepare for a siege.
Which gives us time to stop him
before he reaches Jerusalem.
To save time, Saladin will take
the way across Montgisard.
There's a shortcut there
used by the Bedouin.
-l think you know of the place.
-Yes, l've been there.
A narrow pass
through the mountains.
Saladin would never expect us
to confront them there.
An ambush could do Saladin's army
a great deal of harm.
Grandmaster.
We have no evidence
that Saladin will choose that way,
unless, of course,
de Gothia has intelligence
from yet another ''secret source.''
De Ridefort, this is no time or place
for personal fights.
De Turenne,
what's your opinion?
lt's a wise strategy.
Could avoid a siege,
if God be willing.
We should get a force
out there at once.
We have nothing to lose
and all to win.
My lord.
Arn de Gothia.
The encounters that you've had
can't be interpreted
as anything other
than the will of God.
You shall lead our brothers
in this battle.
You will be in command.
l am honored, Grandmaster.
We'll wait in ambush here.
A sandstorm will soon be upon us.
lt'll be madness to fight in this.
lt's a godsend.
Saladin will be taken by surprise.

GERARD [ In English ]:
l have received news
that Saladin and his army
have set camp here,
by the Lake of Tiberias.
There they await reinforcements.
We shall march directly to Tiberias...
...and take him by surprise.
-ls that clear?
-Sir...
There's not a single drop of water
on the way to Tiberias.
lt's hotter than hell out there.
l must agree with de Gothia.
lt will take us three days
to cross the desert.
Saladin's army
is bigger than ours,
and he has the water.
We cannot meet him in the desert.
That is exactly
what Saladin thinks,
and that is why
we shall defeat him.
We have the True Cross, de Gothia.
Under it, no Christian army
has ever been defeated.
lt was because of the True Cross
that we were victorious
at Montgisard.
And now we shall be
victorious again.
Or do you doubt the power
of the True Cross?
lt's not the True Cross
that l doubt, Grandmaster.
You will obey my orders.

But even in times of sorrow

l have every reason
to trust his judgment.
We would like a new,
young abbess in our convent,
and now we have
a vacant position, so to speak.
Abbess of Gudhem,
how do you like the sound of that?
Your own convent?
Thank you, your Grace.
It is a very fine offer.
But l neither can nor wish
to take any vows.
No?
My time of penance is almost over.
l have had my punishment.
At the next full moon,
l will leave Gudhem Abbey
and go to the Queen,
to await my betrothed
at the castle.
Tell Brosa that.
[ In English ]:

De Gothia.
l would like you to read this.
lt's an honorable discharge,
signed by Grandmaster Torroja.
[ Exhales ]
The day after tomorrow,
my time here is due.
l am well aware, de Gothia,
that my predecessor
thought highly of you
for some reason.
But to me you're just
another subordinate.
l don't think
you will mourn my departure.
Departure?
My penance is over.
Departure?

once and for all?
Departure.

You don't have to...
Brosa says he's dead.
Brosa knows nothing.
He's alive.
He's alive in my prayers.
ln mine, too.
[ In English ]:
Where am l?
FAH KR:
Damascus.
[ Hoarsely ]:
Why am l alive?
Ask my brother.
He was the one who saw you.
[ Woman vocalizing softly ]
[ In Arabic ]: The defeated
salutes you, victorious King.
Greetings,
my most worthy opponent.
Take a seat.
[ In English ]:
l have Jerusalem in my hand.
The city will fall when l wish it.
To show mercy is the mark
of a great king.
The Christians killed everyone
when they took the Holy City.
My people would wish the same.
lf you choose the path of revenge,
the Christians will come back
in greater numbers than ever...
...and the war will never end.
You speak wisely, Al Ghouti.
lf all our enemies were like you,
it would be difficult for us
to win this war.
lt may be that one day
we could share this great city,
all men alike.
Take this dream of peace and unity
with you home.
lt is time for you to return home
and keep your promise.
SALADl N, VOlCE-OVE R:
l hope you will not only remember me
as an enemy, Al Ghouti.
ARN: No, my King.
That l could never do.
[ In Swedish ]:
My name is Ebbe Sunesson.
l bring tidings of friendship
from the Sverker clan.
[ Festive music playing ]
Mark my words: we must act
before the Sverker clan does.
lt's just a matter of time
before they lay claim to the throne.
Let them come.
We're not strong enough right now.
Pray tell, who is the Queen's friend?
l am Cecilia Algotsdotter.
She's been a lay sister
at Gudhem Abbey.
A nun?
She doesn't look like a nun.
[ Laughter ]
That's my mother
you're talking about.
ls that so, boy?
And where is your father?
He's a Knight Templar
in the Holy Land.
Then you have my condolences.
What do you mean?
Jerusalem has fallen.
The Knights Templar
were slaughtered like dogs.
All of them.
Every last one.
You lie!
l may sin from time to time,
but l never lie.
lf you can defeat me,
you may call me what you like.
Magnus. Magnus, calm down.
[ Door opens, closes ]
[ Door closes ]
[ Gasps, sobs ]
BROSA:
Let's be sensible.
Our families
have fought for generations.
We have all lost kinsmen.
l don't think any of us
wants more bloodshed.
No, but we would like you
to reconcile with the Sverker clan.
lf you expect me
to turn over the crown,
you are sorely mistaken.
lf Sverker Karlsson
wanted the crown,
he would have taken it away
from you long ago.
No!
[ Coughing ]
[ Grunts ]
ls the King unwell?
Well, he'd be in better shape
with less beer in him.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Laughter ]
This is best for everyone.
BLAN KA:
Don't go back to the convent.
We will always be friends,
even if l wear a habit and a cross.
But l can't stay.
l must devote my life to something.
The convent is the only life l know.
Welcome back.
[ Horses snorting ]
Cecilia.
ls it...?
lt is you!
lt is you!
Mother.
Have we changed so much?
Our souls are unchanged.
You are the Cecilia l remember.
[ Indistinct instructions ]
[ Horse neighing in distance ]
MAN:
Riders approaching!
[ Indistinct instructions ]
[ In Swedish ]:
So, we meet again.
The famous Knight Templar!
Or are you a farmer?
What a sweet home you've built
for you and your pretty wife.
l suggest you deliver
any message you may have
immediately,
without dismounting.
Watch over her.
The woods around here
are not as safe as they were.
Especially now as your King Knut
lies on his deathbed.
He won't be able
to hold the throne much longer.
[ Breathing raggedly ]
How much time does he have?
l'm not sure,
but he's passing blood in his stool,
and that's never a good sign.
The Sverkers have made
Ebbe Sunesson their commander.
And he has the Danish King
behind him,
as well as the Danish army.
We aren't ready
to meet the Danes in battle.
There's only one solution.
What did you say?
l said there is only one solution.
ARN:
One, two, three.
Good!
Five, six.
One, two...
ARN, VOlCE-OVE R:
l have seen so much evil.
So much death.
l prayed to God
never to see war again.
But if the Sverker King
draws his sword,
war will be upon us.
CECl LIA:
l'm here, too.
l will be with you
every second of the way.
-God has a plan for you.
-To go to war?
To make peace.
[ Clanging ]
[ Shouting ]
ARN:
Sverker has declared war.
His forces will soon be here.
lt will take more than courage
to defeat them.
But l swear to you,
we will be ready.
God be with you, Magnus.
l know you will return.
[ Choir sings ]
[ Men's choir chanting ]
Everything's ready.
l don't know.
Our men are fearful.
Listen to me!
Cast aside all doubt.
Believe!
Believe in our victory.
We chose this place.
Not the Danes
and not the Sverkers.
We chose this time.
Not the Danes
and not the Sverkers.
Believe.
God stands by those
who are strong in faith.
That is why we shall win
and peace shall reign.
[ Cheering ]
[ Cheering stops ]
Horsemen! Forward!
[ Shouting ]
[ Scoffs, laughs ]
They're trying to scare us!
[ Laughter ]
Prepare!
Charge.
[ Shouting ]
Ready!
Wait...
Now!
lt's a trap!
[ All shouting ]
Now!
[ Screams ]
Prepare again!
Charge!
Charge!
[ All shouting ]
Now!
[ Horse whinnies ]
[ All shouting ]
Charge!
[ All shouting ]
For Norway!
[ Shouting ]
[ Shouting ]
[ Grunting ]
[ All shouting ]
Now ride off!
[ Cheering ]
[ Wind howling ]
[ Gasps ]
l will never leave you again.
You're hurt?!
Arn? Arn!
[ Woman vocalizing softly ]
The Virgin Mother
never abandoned us.
l love you.
l love you.
[ Sobbing ]
[ Wails ]
