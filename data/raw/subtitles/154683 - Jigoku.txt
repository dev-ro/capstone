Once drawn by
that merciless wind...
...the fair youth of morning
is at dusk naught but bones.
In the end, all must die.
Numberless are the sins
committed on the way to death.
For those sins, there may be
punishment in the law.
Some may slip through its net...
...but the awareness of sin
cannot be escaped.
Religion imagines...
...a world after death, dealing
punishment in place of the law.
That world is Hell.
'This is a tale of things...
'... not of this world...
'A tale of the "Sai no Kawara"...
'... the bank of the river...
'... where stone is piled on stone
at the boundary of Hell.'
Concepts of Hell
This concept of hell
is not unique to Buddhism.
Zoroastrianism, Christianity,
Islam, all these religions...
...posit this world after death.
In India the concept is thought
to have arisen with Hinduism...
...linked with reincarnation.
With the rise of Buddhism
came the concept of 'naraka'...
...the Sanskrit word for 'hell',
which means 'abominable'...
...or 'tormenting'.
This word exists in Japanese
as NARAKU.
I'll bet that guy died.
You think so?!
And if he did?
Tamura!
Anyway, congratulations.
You're engaged to Yukiko.
I heard something...
...about Prof. Yajima,
your future father-in-law.
In Japan, the concept of Hell
most commonly imagined...
...is the Eight Great Hells
of the Buddhist sutras.
There are many sutras
that take up the subject of Hell.
He talks like a saint,
but he's got a dark secret...
...something he feels guilty about.
It was during the war...
in Malaya.
Who is this guy Tamura?
I know I don't like him.
Can't I get away from him?
Last night would have been
the happiest of my life...
... but for that damned accident!
Hello.
Professor... Mrs Yajima...
thank you very much.
I'll try to make Yukiko happy.
Take good care of her.
Yes, sir.
I'm so happy, Yukiko!
Thank you, Mother.
Mr Shimizu...
...Yukiko's our only child,
and she's a bit spoiled.
But with you, we can rest easy.
Please look after her.
Study hard, and be a scholar
in my husband's footsteps.
I will.
Congratulations.
Tamura!
Surprised to see me?
I'd rung the bell, but I didn't
want to be turned away again.
Anyway, congratulations.
We should have a drink
to celebrate your engagement...
...but uninvited guests shouldn't
stay too long, so I'll be going.
I'll return this.
I'll give you a lift.
Mrs Yajima... your clock's stopped.
They say that's a bad omen.
'Night.
Take it. You're behind on
your rent and your tuition.
I like you, man.
I know everything.
I know you've been sleeping
with Yukiko.
What if she's pregnant?
Can you turn there?
It's a bad road.
There's a stop I want to make.
Look out!
You hit me, you bastard!
Hey! Goddamn you!
I'm Tiger Kyoichi of
the Gondo Syndicate!
Kyoichi!
Kyoichi! Are you all right?!
Get up!
Kyoichi! What's wrong?!
Stop the car! You hit that guy!
I'm not stopping. No one saw us.
That drunk jumped in front of me!
That doesn't matter. We hit him!
What?
This only happened because
you took me out of my way.
The man might be dead.
If he is, we're both murderers!
Is something wrong?
No, nothing.
I didn't sleep last night.
Don't overdo it.
Yukiko's expecting you tonight.
Kyoichi!
Mother...
Are you sure you didn't see
who did it?
Shut up! I said I don't know!
If I ever find out who it was...
'Last night on a road
in Kamiuma, Setagaya Ward...
'... Kyoichi Shiga, 34,
of the Gondo crime syndicate...
'... was struck while inebriated
by a passing vehicle...
'... and died of brain hemorrhage.
'The driver of the vehicle
remains unknown.'
So you want to stick
a manslaughter charge on me?
We're the ones who killed him.
We caused it.
We'll both go. Come with me.
That might satisfy you, but not me.
It'd be stupid.
He was drunk. He walked
into the road. It was suicide.
And he was just
some yakuza scum.
He's not worth
the best years of our lives.
Going so soon?
I've settled your fate for you.
If you go down, you go with me.
In Memory
The Gondo Syndicate
The syndicate paid for the funeral,
but how will we live now?
You must have seen
the car that hit him.
You were out there!
No, I didn't.
But Yoko... what would you do
if you knew who it was?
Find the guy and kill him.
Look what he's done to us!
I didn't tell the police,
but I saw the car.
Ten years ago...
...a truck hit my husband.
He got killed, and the driver
didn't even go to jail.
It's no use telling the police.
Yoko... you and me,
we'll get even for this.
No one will know it was us.
We'll kill him!
Yukiko!
I've been waiting!
I just had to see you!
Shiro...
I'm...
Is something wrong?
Yukiko... I...
...killed a man.
Listen...
...there were two of them.
We can trace the license number.
No matter how long it takes,
we'll get them.
OK?
Let's talk to my father.
He'll think of something.
I can't think. It's like
something's chasing me!
Shiro! You've got to stay calm!
There's no taxis...
A taxi?
Let's walk to the station.
I don't feel like taking a taxi.
The faster I get there the better.
Please! Forget the taxi.
I really don't want one.
You're acting like a child!
Get in...
Where to?
The police station.
Don't go too fast...
Yukiko!
Yukiko!
Shiro... I don't want to die...
I don't want to die...
Yukiko!
Yukiko!
Shimizu... don't blame yourself.
It was fate.
Professor...
...I insisted on the taxi.
It's like I killed her!
Dear...
Mrs Yajima...
You shouldn't have come here.
Go away, please.
Go away, please!
Mrs Yajima!
Give back my daughter!
Give back my daughter!
Fumi!
Give back my daughter!
That's right... suffer.
Your conscience almost won.
You were about to sell me out.
Are you going to win?
Or am I?
Stop it!
Take it easy, will you?
Have a drink with me.
I'm a mess.
Let's dance.
My name's Yoko. What's yours?
Why don't we go somewhere else?
I'm going.
No!
Hotel Yoshino
'Shiro Shimizu'....
It's him!
He's the one who killed Kyoichi!
Can I see you again tonight?
Sure.
I'm glad.
9 o'clock at the bar, OK?
Don't forget.
It's him. No mistake about it.
Yoko, you've got that stuff,
don't you?
Yeah.
Kyoichi... it won't be long.
I'm going to even the score.
Once I finish them,
I'll be coming to join you.
Mother ill. Come immediately.
Father.

Who are you?
Oh, you're Shiro, from Tokyo!
Yes.
I'm Kinuko. I came here last year.
Oh.
This way.
Mother?
It's Shiro.
Shiro!
Mother!
Mother...
...how's Father?
You silly thing!
Your son's very good-looking.
He's got lovely eyes!
Maybe I'll cheat on you.
I want to go back to Tokyo!
Don't talk nonsense!
It's no surprise, sick as I am.
Auntie!
You're Shiro, aren't you.
Yes.
I'm Sachiko. I sent the telegram.
How nice that he came!
Thank you.
Her father paints. Last year
they moved into the next room.
He's an old friend of your father's.
The next room?
Father...
Shiro... you're here...
Hello, Father.
Your mother's better.
I'm having a painting of Hell done
for Jiganji Temple.
This is Ensai Taniguchi.
He can paint, but he
ruined himself with drink...
...and ended up here.
Aren't you taking your walk
this morning?
'Morning.
You're up early, Detective.
It's almost finished, huh?
So, Sachiko... is this where
all the bad people go?
Ensai... have you thought about
what I asked you?
The answer's no.
I won't have Sachiko
marrying a man like you.
No?
You're wanted for fraud
in Osaka, aren't you.
The Prefectural Police called
about a case of art forgery.
Are you going to arrest me?
They'd make a fine couple!
It'd be good to have
a policeman in the family, too.
Let's do this...
When the picture's done,
we'll all have a little talk.
Dr Kusama!
The old man's getting worse!
OK.
Hurry!
Yeah, yeah...
Quickly, Doctor!
I know!
The doctor's here.
It's not just him, Doctor.
We're all weak.
It's the food here!
You're skimming off
the food money!
Who's skimming?!
The Welfare Office
gives us Yen 62 a day.
We spend Yen 70.
The food's fine!
Sachiko...
You're going to marry me.
Let go!
Please!
You like Sachiko, don't you.
Shiro!
Don't do that!
You almost got hit!
I did?
I saw you wandering along
the tracks like that...
You've been here four days now.
Your mother's better.
I'd given up hope.
She said when she got better
she'd take me to Tokyo.
That's all I think about.
Tamura!
How's it going?
I thought I'd take a trip
and see how you were.
What's happened?
Excuse me.
She looks exactly like Yukiko,
doesn't she.
The Yajimas are a bit better.
He's on a lecture tour right now.
He said they might stop here.
Tamura, please!
Go back to Tokyo, will you?
Stay away from me!
I'll put up at that inn over there.
I'll be here a while.
See you.
Shiro!
Shiro!
Your mother's taken a turn
for the worse!
Wait!
If she dies, you're going
back to Tokyo, aren't you?
Take me with you! Please!
Mother!
'I bow in homage
to the divine Buddha.
'I sing in praise of
the Bodhisattva Jizo.
'What transpires...
'... is something...
'... no more of this world.'
Shiro...
Prof. Yajima and his wife are here.
Professor... Mrs Yajima...
Shimizu... there's no need
to say anything.
We're all starting over.
Yukiko!
Yukiko!
Yukiko!
Dr Kusama...
...I'm still a reporter.
What did Gozo's wife die of?
A heart attack.
Hmm...
What does 'hmm' mean?
Are you suggesting
my diagnosis was wrong?
Apologize!
It was wrong.
Who the hell are you?!
Tamura!
Mrs Shimizu died of
medical malpractice.
You knew that, and you made sure
she didn't see another doctor.
What?!
That's not true!
It was Gozo who killed Ito!
Father!
Living with a mistress while
his wife lies sick in the next room!
A long time ago,
Ito and I were lovers.
He stole her from me!
I what?!
Everyone knows that!
You freeloader!
What?
Fool!
You've got no shame!
Father!
Damn him!
Idiot!
It's all right, Doctor. Relax.
You're not the only killer here.
What do you mean?
Silence!
Everyone here has killed.
What does that mean?
Even you, Detective.
Last summer you took a bribe
and framed a man for it.
He couldn't face people.
He killed himself.
Mr Akigawa, you killed a man
with an inaccurate article.
No!
I went to him and apologized!
After he was dead.
And then there's
this fine figure of a man...
...the God-like Director
of this shabby old place...
...the Tenjoen
Senior Citizens' Facility.
Not content with this pretty mistress,
he has another in town...
...the Missus of
the Tonchuken tavern.
That's enough!
And your comrades in Malaya,
Dr Yajima?
Sir!
Old Tome's dead!
You two killed him!
All you think about is the damn
tenth anniversary festival!
Tenjoen Senior Citizens' Facility
Tenth Anniversary Festival
'Day by day...
'... this world fades
in the distance...
'... and the year of my death...
'... draws near.
'Today is the funeral...
'... of another.
'Tomorrow...
'... will be the day of mine.'
They look good!
Can we eat these things?
At least they're cheap, Doctor!
And they're fresh.
Well, we don't want
food poisoning.
Who cares?
These are for the old folks,
not us!
That's big of you!

Shiro...
...my father insists I go to town
and buy him some paint.
I'll be back tonight. I hate
to leave when it's so busy...
Has Mr Tamura gone?
Yes.
And I'm leaving
with Prof. Yajima tomorrow.
Back to Tokyo?
I wanted you to take
Father and me hiking!
You're no fun!
Is this a love scene?
Here I was planning to sneak off
somewhere alone with Shiro!
You like him, don't you.
Me, I love this man!
Shiro, which one of us
do you like?
Sachiko...
Excuse me.
'Bye.
Let's go on a date, Shiro.
I forgot this when I brought
the fish. Are you Mr Shimizu?
This is for you.
Who's it from?
'I had to see you.
I've come all the way here.
'Meet me at Tsuribashi Bridge.
'Yoko.'
How are you... 'Shiro'?
How do you know my name?
I know your name...
...I know everything.
I was Kyoichi Shiga's woman.
The man you hit and killed.
His mother saw you.
We found your names right away.
And I...
...came here to kill you!
I was in love with you
till I found out who you were.
I'm sorry!
Don't do it. There'll be
lots of time to die.
I thought this would happen.
I know everything, don't forget.
Tamura! Who are you?!
If not for you...
Just do what I tell you
and you'll be fine.
Tamura!
Tamura!
Tamura!
It's not an elaborate meal,
but we hope...
...you enjoy this celebration.
You're too modest, Mr Shimizu!
At least the heads are still
on the fish!
Congratulations!
The Tonchuken Tavern
Congratulations!
A gift of fried pork from
the Tonchuken Missus!
And I'll sing for you, too.
Poor singer that you are!
Why, thank you, Missus!
Your attention, please!
'All along the slopes...
'... of this mountain...
'... the scything...
'... has all been done.'
Special tonight:
A kiss for everyone!
Great! Take it off!
No!
Don't we get any of the fish
with the heads on?
Yeah, where's my head?
What would you rather have?
Rotten fish or fried pork?
Fried pork and good liquor!
Shaboom!
I'm sorry, Professor!
Come out here with us.
Do you know where Shiro is?
I'm afraid not.
You don't?
Fried pork and good liquor!
Shaboom!
Shiro?
Is anyone in here?
Shiro!
What are you doing here?
Shiro! I won't let you go!
Shiro!
Sachiko!
Kinuko!
Kinuko!
I knew it!
I'm sick of being a plaything
out in the middle of nowhere!
You are?
I'll kill you both!
Father! It was all my fault!
Damn you!
Stop it! He didn't do anything!
It's my fault!
Damn you!
Father!
Whore!
Shiro... keep your mouth shut.
Go back and sit down
as if nothing's happened.
Ah, Professor...
Thank you. If we leave now,
we can catch the last train home.
I see.
Professor!
Yukiko!
It's time to go.
SAKE! Bring more SAKE!
If it's SAKE you want,
I've got some.
And who would you be?
A relative of someone
unlucky enough to end up here.
I came to help celebrate.
How about a drink?
It's not poisoned, is it?
How can you say such a thing!
I'll gladly drink some
to show you it isn't.
I'll have some.
Allow me.
'And with the dusk...
'... will come death...
'... even to those safe
in their homes.
'Tonight they lay their heads...
'... on their pillows...
'... but when morning comes... '
If you will permit,
I'll test this for poison.
Well, one final drink.
Cheers!
Tamura!
Shiro! The Yajimas
jumped in front of the train!
Shiro!
Tamura! You bastard!
You killed my son Kyoichi!
You pushed Yoko off that bridge!
I know everything!
I know everything!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
They gave us...
...fish that were caught dead!
Shiro...
Tamura!
Where is this?
Here?
This is the river to Hell,
the border of life and death.
The 'Sanzu no Kawa'.
You and I, together...
...are going to Hell!
Shiro! Can you hear it?
That crying?
Listen... there's a baby crying...
It's calling you!
Is it calling me?
Why? Why is it calling me?
Tamura, tell me!
Why is it calling me? Tamura!
Where am I?
I am the great King Enma!
Lord of the Eight Hells of Fire
and the Eight Hells of Ice.
I am judge of the sins of all
who pass into this underworld...
...and he who passes sentence
for those wrongs.
Shiro Shimizu! Recall
your multitude of sins!
Look into this magic mirror!
You hit me, you bastard!
You will face the torment
of the Eight Great Hells!
'The first stone in the pile...
'... is for your father.
'The second stone in the pile...
'... is for your mother.
'The third stone in the pile...
'... is for your brothers and sisters
at home.
'By day you play alone,
piling up stones.
'By night the demons come
to knock them down.
'When at last your pile is done
it will turn to the Bodhisattva Jizo...
'... come to carry you away
to paradise.'
A baby's crying...
It's calling me!
Where's it coming from?
Where am I?
The 'Sai no Kawara'...
...the bank of the river of death,
where children are punished...
...for the sin of dying
before their parents.
Yukiko!
Shiro!
Yukiko!
Forgive me!
It's the same as if
I'd killed you myself.
The baby's crying!
The baby we made.
Our child?
I meant to tell you that night.
The crash killed our child
along with me.
Yukiko!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Give our child a name.
It's a girl.
The poor thing needs a name!
Can I name her?
We'll call her 'Harumi'.
The characters for 'spring'
and for 'beauty'.
It's a pretty name...
'Harumi'...
'Harumi'?
Harumi!
So we had a child...
Oh, no!
I couldn't raise a child alone.
I put her on a lotus leaf
in the river.
She'll be swept away!
She'll be swept away!
Hurry and save her!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Harumi!
I can't go any further.
You stay with her!
Yukiko! We go together! Forever!
The baby's being swept away...
Put my grave right next to yours.
Where a father and mother
should be.
Shiro!
Yukiko!
Yukiko!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Here meet the Six Destinies.
You who dwell no more
in the Three Worlds of time...
...must wander lost
on these six roads...
...for your sins in the world
of the living.
Harumi!
Would you know
where my child's gone?
Professor!
Mrs Yajima!
Shimizu!
We had a child!
Where's she been carried away to?
My daughter...
Yukiko!
Professor... Mrs Yajima...
...forgive me.
If not for me, none of us
would be...
...in this misery.
Forgive me!
Give back my daughter!
Fumi! Stop that!
Shimizu... we've fallen
into Hell, too.
Professor!
Yukiko's death drove my wife mad.
We chose to die!
Professor! We meet again!
It was your fate to fall into hell.
Here's another reason why!
In Malaya, you stole
a comrade's last sip of water.
You killed him.
It's true!
He's right!
That's my canteen! It's mine!
I killed a man!
Yamaguchi!
Water!
Give me water!
Water!
Water!
You who are dead... you may drink
if you wish so much to do so.
This is the pus wrung out
of your festering carcasses...
...and a cesspool
of your foul wastes.
Drink all you wish!
You bastard! You hit me
and drove away!
I'm sorry!
I'll strangle you!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Harumi!
Harumi!
You hit me and drove away!
I'm sorry. Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Spare me your excuses!
You who are dead...
This is the First Great Hell of Fire.
Here flesh is peeled, bones crushed,
eyes plucked and limbs severed.
For each time you cry out
in pain...
...you are returned to life to
to face the torments of Hell again.
Kinuko!
You neglected your duty
as a doctor.
You erred in judgment,
yet felt no shame.
You were a slave
to money and debauch.
You will be sawn in pieces.
A policeman serves the public.
You thought only of yourself.
An innocent man was blamed
for your wrongs.
Your hands will be cut off.
You were the worst of all,
immorality without limit.
Your sins are more than
the stones of the 'Sai no Kawara'.
You will suffer
each and every torment of Hell.
First you will be flayed.
Take me away from here, Shiro!
I loved you the minute
I saw you!
Kinuko!
Father!
Kinuko!
Whore!
No!
Let go of me!
Bitch!
Father!
Shiro!
You come with me.
You will dwell with me
in this dark hell forever.
No! I want to live!
My baby's crying!
She's calling me!
Are you still lost?
You're a fool.
Loving someone...
...and suffering for them...
what's the point of that now?
You meant to sell me out
for those things...
...and for them you committed
one sin after another!
Because you were there!
Because you took me with you!
Do you really think you can escape
from Hell?
Try it, then!
This is the Lake of Blood...
...the lake into which fall
those guilty of immorality...
...adultery, lust, license
and lechery.
Shiro!
Shiro!
I won't let you go!
I won't let you go!
Let go!
Shiro! Shiro!
Yukiko! Harumi!
Shiro!
Help me!
Yukiko! Harumi!
Shiro!
Yukiko! Harumi!
Sachiko!
Sachiko! Sachiko!
Father!
Shiro!
Mother!
Shiro!
Shiro!
Sachiko!
Shiro!
Sachiko!
Sachiko!
Shiro!
I can't see anything!
Have I gone blind?
Sachiko!
Have you seen my father?
Your father?
I think I saw him...
...but where?
Why are you suffering, Shiro?
If only we'd met sooner in life...
Now it's all too late.
It's not! I'm going to live!
You're right. It's not too late.
Even now you want her.
There's still time.
Put your arms around her!
Kiss her! Then you'll be
one of Hell's vermin!
Just like me!
No! You mustn't!
Mother!
Shiro! You're about
to make love to your sister!
Your younger sister!
Sachiko, Shiro's your elder brother!
These hands! The blood
that flows in them is cursed!
When I went to live
with your father...
...I was already pregnant
with Ensai's child.
Ito!
So Shiro is my son?
Yes.
All these years I've lied to you both.
Ito!
This was all your fault, Gozo.
If only I'd known!
I wouldn't have ended up
a drunken derelict!
This is fun! I like you guys
more all the time!
Let's go.
Shiro!
'Big Brother'... wait!
Sachiko!
Your baby... hurry and save
your baby!
I hear her!
Shiro!
Wherever you go,
you go with me!
You can't escape me!
What do you want my brother
to do, Mr Tamura?
You're a demon!
You're the very spirit of death!
Leave us alone!
That's right. I'm a demon.
The very spirit of death.
Shiro! Come with me!
Leave my brother alone!
Shiro...
You come with me!
Come on.
Tamura! You have sold the most
beautiful thing a man has.
You have given your conscience
over to evil!
Those who sign away
their conscience...
...suffer all the torments
of bottomless Hell.
Shiro!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Shiro! Shiro! Help me!
Harumi!
It hurts!
Hear me!
You who in life
piled sin upon sin...
...will never leave
this lowest depth of Hell!
Suffer! Suffer!
This vortex of torment
goes on forever!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Help me!
Help me!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Shiro!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Save me!
Harumi!
Shiro!
Save your child now, or she must
do endless penance in Hell.
This is the last chance
you are given.
Harumi!
Harumi!
Hell! This is Hell! This is Hell!
Harumi!
Harumi!
Shiro!
Harumi!
Shiro!
Yukiko!
Shiro! Save Harumi!
Yukiko!
Shiro!
Brother!
'A life...
'... is merely...
'... two-score years and ten... '
Harumi!
Harumi!
Shiro!
Brother!
