A kiss on the mouth

What if he fired you
when he found the beer cans?
You think l'm hereto

l keep thinking about you.
You have no time for me
You spend all your time
spraying perfume on him
l wait for a smile. And
end up getting an earfl
Get a job! Do this.
Do that. l'm trying
What else should l do?
Am l not good enough without a job?
l haven't washed my cheek
since you kissed me last night
What's your problem?
Are you allergic
to being loved? Well?
Adarsh, the camera
Move an inch and
l'll break your leg
Wow! So he's back from Russia?
l didn't know if he'd ever return
Give Adarsh my wedding invite.
l hear he's here only at nights
Ok.
He wouldn't dare come
in the daytime
Meaning?
- Don't you know?
Those goons beat him to
pulp in front of the shop
So humiliating
They beat Adarsh?
- A royal bashing
The prince took the
loan but wouldn't pay back
You hang out together, right?
Give him the invite
Want one?
You look sweet with
your new haircut.
Want me to find you a husband?
Or will you do it yourself?.
See you later
You used to smile a lot.
What's wrong?
Tell me what's wrong

Who the hell are you?

You..
Who's this guy?

And who'll pay the bills?
- l will.
What?.
Let's get married
Adarsh, you're mad
What's the problem?

Quit the job
Earning means working.
Not useless talk
Me? Useless?
Your dark, skinny bitch
Look at you. Want to be a model, eh?
And l'm useless? Shall l
tell Lalaji about the beer?
You'll be the useless one
Living in a gutter.
Reaching forthe stars
The valiantknight saving womankind
You wait like a fool

So?
She was the one who said

Adarsh, don't go, please
What happened?
They looked so happy
in the hospital that day
They went to thet emple from there
Rashmi, what is it?

to the police a week later
What?.
They followed the driver's hunch.
Near the highway, under a bridge..
.. their bodies were found
What?.
They were chopped into pieces and
shoved into a plastic bag
And buried in the ground
She was the one who first told me
you liked me
That you looked out for me
That you couldn't
take your eyes off me
Why don't you look at me any more?
Did l do anything wrong?
Tell me, what did l do wrong?

How else do we get the footage?
How's life, darling?
What's life without you?
Didn't you miss me?
This is good. Better
Naina, you.. Stop laughing so much.
A sting is about winning trust.
Nobody opens up without it

Sorry. Sorry. Very sorry.
''You look good naughty.

fingers dialing your number
This is very bad.
Ok?
l don't want to shoot any more.
Stay away from me for an hour
Shall l shoot you?

Likea doll

The casting couch is old hat.
lt won't survive the weekend
Won't survive? But he's lndia's..
..top pop star
Not good enough
Right.
- Why are you butting in?
One minute, Prabhat
So what if he hit on her?
What's his image anyway?.
''You're cute when you're naked''
He sings such songs.
Any sex footage?
No
Miss Meerut, all over again
Try a double sting.
Pre-denial, post-denial
This storybreaks. Loki denies it
Denies it? But it's all on camera
He'll say it's fictitious.
She's a lying slut
One more sting and we nail him
Let's go, Naina
One minute
Naina
- One minute
Nail him?
What if he offers you money..
..to buy the footage?
Brilliant, Goldie.. - Ma'am,
it would be illegal.
One second, Prabhat. Sit down
This is what you do.
We already have this footage
Meet Loki again. On camera
Tell him about this footage.
Make him buy it from you
That's blackmail
- He must offer you money on camera
Bring us that footage.
That'll be the sting..
..of the century
Get it? He's seen buying footage..
..that he claimed is fictitious
A perfect scoop. lt'll be great.
How will that help?
- Talk shows. lnterviews
Crying. Whining. Apologizing.
We can stretch it for a season
''See how cute naked
Loki looks'' Not bad.
And then?
- Nothing. That's it
Call him
Naina!
l'll film you from the other table.
The mike's on you
Why didn't you tell them that
we have the sex footage?
What happened with Miss Meerut?
l pretended to be her client.
She was undressing
My camera jammed
That's what all
the taunts are about
Why do you listen to her?
- Who?
Your editor. That witch
Because l'm useless
Useless. You toppled the government
You unravel the truth.
You deserve an award
Sure. My website was shut down
One of my guys went to jail. CBl is
after another one. l was prosecuted
That's the award
But you did it for the country
The country wants..
..prime time entertainment
Like you
You can't be a rme being close..
..to anyone else, right?
Where is your friend?
Sit down
Be patient
That's beyond me
She's on for a threesome?

Demanding sex for music video

The camera jammed in the scuffle
