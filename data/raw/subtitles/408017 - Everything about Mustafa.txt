ALL ABOUT MUSTAFA
And now let's cruise back to
the 60s for a little romance...
With the track 'Will you still love me
tomorrow'.
Hi, Ceren!
Mustafa!
Mustafa! Mustafaaa!
Come back!
Look, it's not too late.
Mustafa, you've signed your life away!
Timur, beat it! That's really out of order!
-I want to die!
Mustafa! Mustafaa! This is the end!
From now on it's only women!
Jerk, it'll be too late for anything
by the time this tape gets watched.
Oh God! It's too late!
-Timur! Timuur! Shut up, will you?. Shut up!
-Mustafa, look.
-Ceren, we love you!
-Ceren, I caught the bouquet!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Mukadder Hanim, can I ask you to say
a few words as the groom's mother?.
They say mothers prepare the way
but can't determine the hereafter.
There you go. I hope God gives them
the best possible life together.
Look, you've done your filming.
Now leave us in peace.
And it's over to you
to speak for the bride's side.
We wish them both a happy life
and a long, loving marriage like ours.
Wow, look at that!
I'm so goddamn good-looking!
-But my love, you're always the same.
-I could eat you up.
Ooph, they all say the same thing here.
Hey Dad, hit the fast-forward button.
Start from when I was born.
Those are the exciting bits anyway.
He learns all those lines
from the sitcoms.
No more sitcoms for you.
It's documentaries from now on.
Learn a bit about life,
about the world. At your age, l.
When I was your age,
there was only one channel.
I'd wait two hours
to watch a documentary.
You probably mean the radio, Dad.
TV wasn't around in your time.
You'd have had me explain the jokes.
-Dad.
-Yes?. Go on.
Gran says you've broken out of
your eggshell.
But that you don't like your shell.
What does she mean?.
And the phone rings right on cue
to spare me a difficult moment.
Don't worry about Gran, Kerem.
She talks like that sometimes.
-Do they always light up, Dad?.
-Look! They light up and go off.
Well, look at you two.
I was at least expecting one corpse.
-Who was it?.
-Ayla.
She asked when we'd go to Bauhaus.
Her summerhouse needs painting, too.
Ah, I completely forgot.
So we'll need a painter and all that?.
-Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
-My love.
Come on, honey. Time for bed.
You have that meeting tomorrow, too.
You still have your ax to grind.
Look, we're getting more and more
like a sitcom family.
You go and er.
Come on, Kerem.
You should have been in bed hours ago.
Didn't you hear?.
The guy said they live in the forest.
There aren't any fireflies here.
Come on now.
Dad, let's move somewhere
where there are fireflies.
The more I chase the faster you flee.
Is that you, my firefly?.
The more I chase the faster you flee.
Is that you, my firefly?.
-You remember that?. -Oh God, Guzin
and Baha. I hate songs like that.
-I suppose you were listening to Bach
even before you were born. -Exactly!
-OK, honey. Good night.
-Good night.
Drunk with young desire
My first love, my first passion.
Just let me show you
what young love is all about.
Not there. Those go round the back.
To the studio.
I have a client meeting at 3.00.
Any change of plan and I'll call you.
I want to believe in people
not paper.
Arthouse has always believed in people.
Gentlemen.
Other advertising agencies have faith
in their products, the market.
I mean, I think I've always been right
to believe in people.
And I think I've progressed
in the right direction.
The right direction
with the right guys.
I have the image of this country's
vile little civil servants.
The sad idiots who mess with numbers
in order to pocket a few pennies.
Like mice gnawing at paper.
Little rodents.
Gentlemen, I'll ask you one last time:
where is the money?.
But you didn't look at the
attached error margins. -I did.
-You didn't.
-I did.
But I don't believe them.
They're a pack of lies. That's why.
I've never lied to anyone. Besides,
believing them or not is your problem.
Good luck in your new job.
The meeting's over.
Calm down. You're still young.
Arthouse is neither the beginning
nor the end of the road for you.
-Kenan, I didn't lie. Besides, you read
the reports, too. -I know. I know.
Everyone here knew that.
Sometimes the gods need a sacrifice.
So they can keep being gods.
-I'm thirsty.
-Don't tell me you shot the broccoli.
-I'm sweating. -Aynur, you've gone
blank again. Taner tell you?.
-Mustafa Bey, I'm dealing with it.
-I'm thirsty.
Don't you talk to each other?.
Just look at the way you work.
The client gave up on the broccoli
at the last minute.
I want complete silence.
A run-through for the lights.
Don't forget you're upset.
Go ahead.
But honey, we cut the holiday short
and raced home.
Just because our credit card limit
was used up. I can't believe it!
But we can't discount this holiday.
Next summer, I promise.
Some things you can never discount.
That's why life is so short.
-Who are you?. Why are you here?.
-Excuse me.
To make your dreams come true.
Those dreams you just put off.
The Titanium Card.
It'll make your dreams come true.
Unlimited credit. No charges.
The Titanium Card.
Yes, my love?.
-Can you talk?.
-Yes. Go on.
-How did that meeting go?.
-Same as always.
What the hell are you doing?.
It's my right of way!
-For God's sake.
-What's going on?.
Nothing. I was talking to the truck.
I'm going to fetch Kerem
from his swimming class.
What shall we do this evening?.
I did cook something.
-But we can eat out if you like.
-Maybe. I don't know.
We'll see. I'll call you.
I have a pile of work to get through.
OK. We'll talk later.
Kerem?
My Mum's really late.
Can I call her on your cell phone?.
Sure. Tell me her number.
You know it off by heart, right?.
Well done you.
0-5-3-3.
-It's ringing but she's not answering.
-Why isn't she answering?.
She didn't hear
if she's somewhere noisy.
What shall we do?.
How about calling your Dad?.
No, he'll be busy.
Let's call my Gran.
OK. You know her number?.
Well done you.
Yes, that's me.
No. There must be some mistake.
I just spoke to her.
What's the matter, Gran?.
Feeling a bit better?.
My colleagues will need to talk
to you about a few things.
The deceased's personal belongings
and the inquiry.
How did it happen?. I don't get it.
What truck?.
How can a car drive under a truck
in the center of town?.
Sounds like your cell phone's ringing.
They weren't in town.
They were coming back from Kilyos.
What?. Kilyos?. How do you mean?.
They were coming back?.
My condolences.
You know the other guy in the car?.
His life isn't at risk,
but he's in a bad way.
We assumed you were a relative.
Who is he?.
Fikret Kocaoglu. A 28 year-old.
We're waiting for him to come round.
I guess by tomorrow
he'll be in a condition to talk.
-I don't know him. -OK, sir. Just let
him come round. Let's go now.
Who are you?.
Who the hell are you?.!
Wake up!!
Look out! What are you doing?.
Sir, get a grip on yourself.
Get off me! Leave me alone!!
Get off!
Clear out of here.
What the hell are you doing?.
You still don't get it?.
It's your wife's lover. Her friend.
He has a photo of her in his wallet.
What's so hard to grasp about that?.
OK, sir.
Get up, sir. Come on now.
Fikret! Fikret! Son! Fikret!
-Is he dead?. Tell me if he's dead.
-Wait, dear. Wait.
-Are there no doctors?.
-It's nothing. Listen to me. Listen!
Oh God. What's wrong with
you people today?.
Fikret is fine.
Are there no doctors?. My child.
Tell me if he's dead.
Who are you?.
Who are you?.
Who are you?.
Why are you messing with my life?.
My God, this is a nightmare.
A complete nightmare.
Want a smoke?.
-I don't.
-OK, OK. Don't lose it.
My God.
When will Dad be back, Gran?.
He'll be back soon enough, dear.
I expect he's busy now.
He'll be dealing with the er.
Kerem, come here.
I want to ask you something.
Will you come over to us tonight?.
You can play with Mert.
There's the playstation. Huh?.
Kerem, we got the Grand Roadrider
yesterday. You'll come, won't you?.
I'll come and fetch Kerem tonight.
The kids will distract him. OK?.
-I don't know, er.
-Jale.
Jale. If only his father was back.
He's not answering the phone.
I'd say he's dealing with the corpse
but would it take this long?.
No one can stop us.
After all, your Mum's dead.
Idiot! Shut up!
In the name of God,
the Compassionate, the Merciful.
Dad's back!
Ah! Then why we didn't hear the car?.
-Dad, what are you doing?.
-Running.
Dad, Mum's dead.
-Son?.
-Mum!
Oh look, we have guests.
Jale, Nilgun and their children:
Mert, Oya, Can.
-Who are you?.
-Murat
And Murat.
Is that all?.
Mustafa, you're tired.
You don't know
what you're saying. Go to bed now.
Mustafa, we're really sorry.
If it's OK with you,
Kerem will stay with us tonight.
The kids will distract him.
Come on, honey.
Get yourselves together, kids.
We're leaving now.
Come on, kids. Don't bring pajamas.
You can borrow Mert's.
Come on, kids. Run, run, run.
Give me a kiss, Kerem. Thanks, kids.
OK, see you in the morning.
You know Jale?. When she was younger,
she was in love with me.
You think she's upset
about Ceren dying?.
How could you say that, Mustafa?.
The girl came to offer her condolences.
Shame on you!
You still can't help talking
like a village woman, Mukadder Hanim.
But you're right.
We're a family in mourning now, right?.
When I was small, families in mourning
had loads of visitors. Right, Mum?.
Now look.
How many people are there here?.
Families in mourning were given food.
We haven't been given any, have we?.
There is food, son. I'll get you some.
Ceren made a fabulous stew.
I don't want any.
As you like. If I say 'As you like,'
we won't fight. Or so they say.
You know what they're singing, Mum?.
'Have mercy, Lord.
Have mercy on my tears.'
Everyone lies to me, Mum. You know?.
Look, those are the sculptures
Ceren made.
They're looking at us. See?.
So self-righteous. So fake.
Liars.!
Liars.!
Go on, you lie to me.
Say she'll be back next week. Go on!
Enough!
My wife was cheating on me, Mum.
The imam says he can't wait any longer.
What shall we do?.
-Can't you try his cell phone again?.
-I keep trying. He's not there.
Then the funeral should go ahead.
He's obviously not coming.
Ah, son! Ah, Mustafa!
Here, take these. Bring them back
when you're finished downstairs. OK?.
If there's no rush, I'll pop out
and get the boy some underwear.
OK, there's no hurry.
-Will I see you when I get back?.
-Yes. I'm around.
Hey, strong boy! Fix me a tea!
-So we had you reeling this week.
-Oh, come on.
Thank the rain. The pitch was slow.
If only I hadn't done my leg in.
So it rained on you guys,
but we stayed dry. Don't kid me.
You got that down right?.
Let me see. OK.
Remember: where he lives, what he eats
and drinks. I want to know everything.
You want me to write all that down
in a notebook?.
A notebook, a book, wherever.
Look, the most important thing is
when he gets discharged.
Don't frighten him off.
Keep your head down.
OK. Don't worry.
I'll pretend to make friends with him.
-I'll find out everything about him.
-OK.
Here, take this for now.
I'll be giving you the same again.
-So half when the job's done, right?.
-Hey, bravo.
-This is your mobile number, right?.
-Right. The one you wrote down.
From now on I'll keep it switched on
all the time.
OK. Call me and I'll ring you back.
See you then.
Hey, shame on you! I wouldn't lie.
Don't you dare die!
Don't go disappearing anywhere!
You hear me, son of a bitch?.
You'll be seeing more of me.
Oh, thank you. Thanks then.
See you in the neighborhood then.
He's a cab driver. The cab's not his.
He lives in Kucukarmutlu.
He leaves the house at dawn.
He works days for Guleryuz Taxi.
I swear I didn't see a truck.
I wasn't drunk. I don't drink.
I've been a cab driver for ages.
I carry lives around.
Thanks.
May God grant your every wish.
Look, I'm a decent, honest citizen.
I swear I've never broken the law.
Don't come in, Mustafa!
-Fuck!
-Shut up! Walk over to the jeep.
-Move it or I'll really fuck you!
-Please. Please.
Don't shout! Shut up!
Lower your hands. Lower them!
We're not shooting a goddamn western!
You're not the only smart guy around.
Walk normally!
Get in!
Get in!
Drive!
-Where are we going?.
-Get us out of the neighborhood.
I'll direct you from there.
Don't try any tricks on the road
or I'll blow your brains out.
You think I couldn't do it?.
-You realize this is abduction?.
-That's what you think.
Abducting who?. You're not human!
Please don't look at me like that.
Hand over your cell phone.
What?.
You're telling me you don't have one?.
But you do.
We both know that, don't we?.
Come on, hand it over!
-Where are we going?.
-Somewhere nobody will find us.
Welcome.
Come on, move it!
Good morning.
-I need to pee. -Yes, I know. That
usually happens in the morning.
But then you'll start crapping on about
how we should be friends.
Because we have so much in common.
But I don't see it like that.
You see, I'd never be as coarse
as to say 'l need to pee'.
I'd ask, say, where the bathroom was.
That's more refined, huh?.
I don't need to ask
where the bathroom is.
I already know.
I'll fucking kill you! Son of a bitch,
you're driving me crazy! Animal!
So you need to pee, huh?.
Well, what a coincidence: I do, too.
Get dried and put these on.
I'll be outside.
Into the kitchen.
Right to the far end.
Good thing I put bread in the freezer.
It's as good as fresh after toasting.
Go on, start.
We'll make do with this for now.
I'll go into town later and stock up.
We. How do you mean?.
How long are we staying here?.
-Till you finish your story.
-What story?.
I don't get it. What story?.
You know what story.
You and Ceren.
How it happened. How you met.
What you did. How long it went on.
You have to tell me everything,
right down to the finest detail.
But no lies. If you start lying,
I'll sense it immediately.
You see, I know my wife inside out.
-So what happens then?.
-When?.
-After I've told you everything.
-You mean when you're done?.
When you're done with the story,
I'm going to kill you.
You won't believe me now.
But just take a look in the garden.
I was digging while you were asleep.
It's not completely finished yet.
I'm pooped. Out of condition
with all that sitting at work.
In the old days I'd have done the job
in an hour.
The tea's ready.
Won't you have some?.
I just ask one thing of you, Kenan.
Don't make my absence felt.
-Carry on like I'm there, OK?.
-OK. Don't worry about this place.
-But. Are you all right, Mustafa?.
-Fine, Kenan. Don't worry about me.
OK. I won't ask where you are
because I know you won't answer.
But please be careful
and get back here in one piece.
You know me, Kenan.
I wouldn't do anything stupid.
I don't know you. All these years
I've never got near to knowing you.
Anyway, call me incompetent.
Goodbye.
-Mustafa.
-Yes?.
Where are you?. Your phone's been off.
We were about to tell the police.
-I haven't slept for days.
-Mum. Mum.
You're killing us here. Forget me,
but at least have pity on the boy.
Mum!
I'm fine, Mum. Don't worry. I'm taking
a vacation. Don't call me for a while.
I'm in a small town on the coast.
A beautiful place.
If you could only see the sea.
It's this bluish green.
It's quiet. Just a few tourists.
I'm staying in a fantastic hotel.
You know, it's the first time
I've felt this calm and relaxed.
I've also made new friends here.
They like me a lot too, Mum.
We have a great time together.
If you could see the view.
It's amazing.
I'm taking photos of everything.
Don't you agree
I deserve a vacation like this, Mum?.
-Ah, you take credit cards.
-Of course.
Honey, I'm home!
As she sat there dying,
she said, "How beautiful."
That's what I heard.
Or thought I heard. "How beautiful."
Forget when she died.
Start from the beginning, idiot.
It was last fall. A whole year ago,
I guess. I was in the cab again.
I took a customer to Etiler.
It was warm, but very muggy.
Like it was going to rain. You know,
that suffocating kind of weather.
I was passing Mayadrom on my way back
when someone hailed me.
It was Ceren. God rest her soul.
She didn't say where she was going.
I didn't ask either. I just drove.
That happens sometimes, you know?.
Someone gets in. They're in a state.
They don't say a word.
And you just drive.
Thank you.
They stop you some place, get out,
pay the fare and off you drive.
I thought it would be
the same routine all over again.
She didn't say a single word.
Liar! Liar!
I'll fucking kill you!
Was it Ceren who started this?.
Admit it! You raped her, didn't you?.
Don't shout! Don't shout!
Shut up!
You landed me in the shit, you two!
You fucked up my life! Ah!
You think I lied to you, bastard?.
Your wife gave it to me! Your wife!
