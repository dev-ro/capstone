For God Sake!
Please listen to me,
Stop being stubborn,
Many bad things are not getting over
in our society,
because we don't speak.
We kept silence,
Sometimes for our respect and
sometimes for someone
else respect.
To hear your story if any single
house will be change,
then many girl's lives will be better,
And Imagine...
If some thousand house will
be change,
then it will be huge achievement.
Sir! A woman got a death sentence,
her forgiveness appeal.
In the condition of rejection of appeal
she have a wish...
Why did she came to me?
It's a strange wish.
And only you can give her
the permission,
That girl wants that standing
on the place of death sentence,
and get recorded her story
to TV channels.
She probably thinks that it will be
great impact in her story,
Isn't it any political motive?
I don't think so.
She is from the religious family,
Must get a recording copy,
Throw it away
And make your lives by your selves.
Assume it my last wish,
My name is Suleiman Dogar
and I am a Jailor.
This jail is my territory,
Cut off time is 4.
Story will be on any stage at cut off
time I will stop it,
And you will have to leave this place
on few seconds notice,
In any condition,
Otherwise your cameras are
very sensitive,
and my guard's sticks are
very strong.
In your opinion why did
I called you here.
In my opinion you want to confess
your sins and want to teach
lesson to others.
Really?
Some other reason?
You wanted to tell us that
you are innocent,
I am not innocent,
I really committed a murder,
But I am only a murderer.
Not a sinner,
Murderer is not a sinner?
It's not necessary,
Court made me sinner
because I didn't defend myself.
When you didn't open your mouth
in court then why now?
If I would talk in court then
they will think...
I am lying to save my life.
I don't have much time and
story is too long.
That's why I begin my story,
When India got partition,
but one of them I mean
My Grandfather,
Hakim Syed Hashmatullah feel
Lahore is like Delhi...
that's why he lived here.
My father's income getting less.
But kids are getting increased.
My mom born 14 kids.
Come with me at shop.
I want to talk to you.
You go to shop.
That kid...
Looks fine but...
But what?
But he is not normal.
He looks like a boy.
But he is not a boy.
You don't worry at all.
What kind of examination is that.
After so many daughters...
How did you think about that?
Why don't you understand that what
is the mean of keep him alive?
Do you have any idea?
When he will grow up then
what will he become,
and what people will say,
When people will know then...
We will announce that he is
under devil's shadow,
and we won't let him go out
from the house,
We will assume him our daughter and
we won't send him to school.
Then what's your problem?
How long you will do it all?
Entire life,
I will do it for my entire life,
But I can't even think about it what
you want to do.
You are such a cruel man,
You should better give me
another daughter,
I am dying to thinking about that
I didn't get rid of that,
Your son's wish will still alive,
Hakim Sahib didn't come yet?
He is just coming.
You just go outside,
Is everything alright?
I think Allah has send help in
that kid's face,
That Sheema is standing outside,
We have found that angels gave you
our belonging by mistake,
Nobody has known yet,
Why did you bring her here?
She is not asking for free,
She will give you money for that,
If you both will ever come here again
then I will kill both of you,
He is not good for you and
I am giving you money today,
Dad's hatred was like with him
that he refused to keep his name,
He said why did he need name,
He don't have to go to school.
We kept his name Saif,
what become Saifi,
Dad's fear was always in our house,
but when Saifi grown up he has seen
hatred in his eyes for him,
that's why when dad came to house he
get hide in a room,
Saifi! Come out and tell him
to go from here,
Only family members kiss on chick,
If someone else do then
it's a cheap thing,
Do you understand?
It's been so long you didn't make
any picture.
Make it today...
After few years I got married.
To see lot of daughters...
My father agreed with the
first proposal.
I have decided.
Until my family condition didn't
get well.
Until I won't born a baby.
Fights getting increasing.
Finally I have to leave
my husband house.
When I came back to my
father's house then.
My sisters were also getting young
along with Saifi.
I am going to Pak Patan on
Saturday,
Give me some money,
I will do something,
And your income is getting
less day by day.
What will happen?
Trust to God.
This is not good Saifi.
You are grown up not eat
by your self.
If you feel bad then I will
eat by myself.
Go to roof and have some fun.
Where is your mom?
She is coming.
Where you have been all day long?
I was late in college.
Come!
You came late...
Without your permission,
I gave you a responsibility.
And I hope you will
not refuse me.
We have announced Mosque committee,
Mr. Sheikh is the chairman,
and we can't find for cashier
better than you,
As a Chairman Sheikh has begin
from 50,000.
You keep it,
Finish your fair,
Police is coming,
Except my dad...
we all like Master's family.
His wife was my mom's only friend,
His family was like an
example for us,
After Master's poor income...
his both sons were medical student,
Shall I break your hands,
Put your hand on it and take a swear,
You haven't done anything with
your self.
What do you mean?
Why no kid is getting birth in our
house since many years.
You are still young,
Will you tell me something or
may I slap on your face,
I have your answer,
Why did you close the door?
Because what I want to tell
you today,
what might be some daughter would
have said to her father,
In fact mom should have said it,
but she can't say anything with
your fear,
You talk allot, You tell me,
I got mom's operation to stop
the population of this house,
What have you done?
Do you know you have commit
such a big sin,
Only Allah gave the life,
Yes, He is...
but it doesn't mean what you think,
It means he gave us capability to
born lives,
How many kids Hakim Shifat have to
born and how many Master Akhtar have to
Allah didn't make saints to write that,
Why don't you understand?
As much we will have mouths we
will need more food as well.
And why don't you understand he took
the responsibility to give food,
Then I am sure saints have
our wrong address.
Because food is not coming here,
So many people are dying with hunger
they all are dying because...
Allah is not fulfilling his
responsibilities.
Now you will tell me Allah's opinion,
His prophet didn't tell us,
that His Ummah should be greater than
everyone on Armageddon,
How our prophet can say that?
He must have said that my Ummah
will be greater than everyone,
but it must be greater in respect
and progress.
How he could say rather they are fools
but they must be bigger in quantity
Rather they are dying with hunger but
they must be bigger in quantity.
Look at mom,
What you have turned her into?
I wish I would be God, I would
make every man to born a child.
So you people should know,
Within a year we will establish
this Madrasa.
You open the door on right time,
I am in hurry today,
Durani's hearing today,
I got more 40,000 fund,
You keep this money,
Have some tea...
I will be late.
I have requested you many times,
that now you give the fund's
responsibility to someone else.
I always told you every time that
Sheikh has gone to England,
When he will come then
he will decide it,
Why you always heard before me?
I think you like to being guard.
Come! Nothing will happen,
Are you mad? Somebody will see.
I have decide one thing,
you should sing with me in concert,
Some crazy can think about it,
Fine! This crazy has decided,
I will must take you along,
Sure!
I am telling the truth.
If we will make our own album,
then we can make disasters,
I don't want more disasters,
And disaster will come when
my dad will know,
When I will become a doctor
next year,
and after becoming my wife,
after becoming a singer,
you will be a celebrity.
What I would be?
You will be famous,
Shall we start?
What should I tell you?
You can't even imagine,
what kind of places are in Lahore,
Mustafa was saying he didn't show
me the entire Lahore,
I don't know when we will
see all these things,
I saw a moon in Anarkali Market,
Mustafa spend lot of money,
He tore this page from Mustafa's
magazine and made it,
you are worried about the magazine,
You just have a look he made
such an amazing thing,
I wish we could send him to
some drawing school.
She was praying that Tendulkar
should make a century,
She is lying, Am I lying?
And tell what you die for Afridi,
Enough!
When I will come back I want all
of you to pray,
Do you have any idea what
you have done,
In such house where we are not allowed
for anything but to breathe.
What your nonsense will bring,
She started that,
You made us lost,
If you would pray from heart
then we would win,
It's also possible our team didn't
play well, Shut up!
You are right,
What we think about prayers?
Entire Pakistan prays but we
always lose the match,
And those Australian people...
They are winning from 20 years
without prayers,
I am telling you to make her shut up.
I will raise my hand again.
Not from your hand but impress me
with your opinions,
What do you think?
Allah decides...
that how many runs Inzamam
have to make today,
Entire Pakistan is disturbing Allah,
and entire India is disturbing to God.
They don't understand,
If their Goddess will make them win
then why did they lose.
Nor we understand...
If Allah have to make us win then why
would he take 17 years to make us win.
What are you looking at me?
Your sister will be jealous,
Aashi praised for your drawing,
that's why I got you this,
Tell us if you have any demand,
First thing is that my daughters are
not burden on me,
and we are not from some
ordinary family,
I must have few conditions,
First condition is that guy must
be religious,
and second he must be Syed
and from Sunni.
What have you done?
How am I looks like?
How many times I told you?
You are a man and be like a man,
what happen?
What is this?
I felt to see how am I looks like?
Does men do it?
You are not a girl.
I am a girl.
If I am not a girl.
Then why do I like Mustafa,
I also want to marry with him,
Don't you ashamed,
I will tell to dad.
Don't tell him,
I will never do it again,
What will happen with him?
If he will go out,
and what will happen if he
won't go out,
You are not thinking about that,
And your dad...
He won't even find out if he won't
see Saifi from a week,
And if he will know then
let him know,
at this time it's most important to
save Saifi from disaster.
But he is very naive,
What will he do?
I have decide it,
I know a place.
It's far away but his drawing
will be helpful there.
I will take him along in morning,
Long time no see.
I have come for a job,
This kid is my cousin,
I want you to teach him,
His drawing is very good,
Fine, but sit first.
Bring some tea.
What's your name?
Syed Saif.
With it's tip...
draw that truck on floor.
He is passed before drawing,
His style is telling me that
he is good.
They also live here,
He is good from heart.
I didn't want to bring him here
because of these guys,
But he don't know anything else
except drawing,
I must have to bring him here,
You have to be careful about him,
Go and sit over there.
If he didn't learn from anywhere
then it's amazing,
I will give him 100 rupees daily.
Work hard!
I will come in evening to
pick you up.
I am sorry,
Hold the brush properly,
Come I will teach you.
You son of a bitch!
Won't you listen,
Get lost from here,
Get your clothes,
Shameless people.
I have told you,
You have told me and you were right,
But our Saifi won't give up,
Today was his first day,
that's why he suffered allot,
It's today's earning,
When we will give your salary to dad
in the end of month he will be happy,
He will love you more than us,
Feed him some milk,
Come and sit!
I was missing you,
Our truck is ready,
I will leave tonight,
I will be back after month,
Where is Master?
He is changing the clothes,
I will be back after changing clothes.
Such a hot item,
Can I come?
How is your wife?
Don't ask about her,
My wife is your fan now,
She sent this sweet for you,
Make medicine for one more week,
I think Murad is on vacation,
He is on long vacation,
I couldn't manage his salary,
So I removed him,
Nobody can doubt on
your qualities,
then why your business is not
running well.
Every man is running behind doctors.
If you don't mind,
then I have an idea for you,
Our Moulvi has gone Saudi Arabia,
You teach Quran to our kids,
I will gather more kids,
We gave 500 for one kid,
You will make handsome amount,
I will must teach them,
but there must be some Moulvi
near your house,
There are many, But most of them,
are not ready to come our house,
We are musicians...
You can teach Urdu along
with Quran,
This medicine is for one week,
I am sure you won't need anymore.
My name is Ishaq but if you want
to ask someone,
then people call me Saaka Kanjar,
Don't go till an hour,
Now you also leave.
Pick it up,
Rasheed bhai! My clothes are inside,
and that's locked,
Your clothes are hanging up
on truck,
Go and change inside,
Few animals are inside but
you don't need to afraid,
My turn is first,
Shut up! Don't screw it up,
Saifi is free?
What do you mean? You didn't take him,
We thought he is gone,
He is not here from 30 minutes.
I think he is gone in bus,
How could he take bus?
Are you sure he is not here?
We didn't move from here,
And those fagots?
They didn't came back,
I wish your husband would have killed
you instead of leaving you,
He should be dead,
Mom! Saifi has come,
My beloved!
Come early tomorrow,
If you won't come then I will
be worried.
There must be few people there.
Why you didn't shout?
They have put cloth in my mouth,
Tara was saying I couldn't be
man forever,
as much I try to work,
Finally I will have to dance like them,
No!
I made a mistake,
I won't send you again,
What are you doing?
Leave him,
What happen Zainab?
It was necessary to do.
If he would be alive now,
then we would die everyday,
You didn't understand yet...
You believe Allah is a creator and you
hate his creativity,
Pig is also Allah's creation then say,
we should love pig.
He was uglier than pig.
At least pig have quality that he
born with pigs,
It was pig's fault that his family
wasn't pig.
If this pig would born in this house
one generation earlier than?
You go from here before I
become more angry,
I want to go to police station,
But because of his daughters...
I have stopped myself.
You are right, I think mom...
it will be a favor to them if we
should send Hakim into jail.
What are you saying?
He is their father,
Hakim! I am sorry to hear
about your son,
I am busy these days...
but I thought you live in
my area,
So it's my duty to come,
Thanks for coming,
I wanted to request you,
When you will be free then come
to police station for 5 minutes,
Don't worry!
It's a matter of one life,
I am sure this girl is innocent,
You please awake the president and
stop this death sentence,
What are you saying?
He is the president of this country,
How could I awake him at this time,
You try to understand my position,
You are a nice man,
I know you will find some solution,
I will call you back,
You are such a religious and
respected person,
I don't want to treat you like
a police officer,
I am sure you won't lie in
front of God,
How did your son died?
Please move this Holy Book
from my face,
Your doubt...
...is right.
Why did you have to do it?
Honor Killing...
is not an amazing thing for you,
Only daughters get killed for honor,
I wish...
he would be my daughter,
Now the situation is that...
after your confession we have
to post mortem your son,
Help me
My house is full of daughters,
What will happen with them?
You should have think about it earlier
You don't know where the
society is going,
For God Sake...
Please bury this thing here,
but entire police station has known,
Tara who has reported he is
sitting outside,
How could I stop so many people.
Who can dare in front of you?
I will have to shut their mouths
with money,
It's a bribe,
but you decide...
My God knows I got loan for funeral.
I am putting my job in danger
to save your life.
Listen to me,
Money will be back but life
won't come back,
How much I will have to arrange?
You are a poor man,
Arrange Three hundred thousand.
But today!
I can't hold FIR till morning,
Last time, Two hundred thousand.
And assume your self under custody,
My men will be with you,
Whoever I ask...
he started telling me his problems,
I wish I would have kill her instead
of him,
Tell dad that pay the money
from Mosque funds.
He reformed God's mistake
to kill Saifi,
Allah will be happy from him,
This witch will send me to hell.
She is right,
When you will get some money keep
it back in funds,
Nobody will know,
It's Allah's belonging,
Nothing could hide from him,
Your problems are not hidden
from him,
If nothing will happen then we
will sell this house,
Why you didn't think about it earlier?
Now don't say anything,
I want to go Mr. Ishaq's house,
Wake up and look!
Indian currency has arrived,
Where it is?
Look over there,
Sit here!
You told me to teach Quran
to your kids,
I did.
But later I found that you
are Sunni,
You are right,
But we can say something,
I am helpless.
I promise you that I will
control my tongue,
Yourjob is done,
What about the timings?
Afternoon,
and before evening,
Why not in morning?
We slept in morning after working
all night long,
We woke up in afternoon,
You come at 5 and teach till 7.
If I will get salary in advance,
I couldn't go to bank today,
Otherwise I would give you
large notes.
2000 for 4 kids.
He promised to give food,
He didn't tell...
that how he will provide us,
I think all problems have seen
our house,
I got 2 more kids,
This place is different from your
house,
It looks like a nice place,
It's my meena's room.
She is my daughter.
We all are the followers
of one prophet.
This Shia and Sunni is just
a rubbish things,
Finish it all.
We want that you get your daughter
married with his son,
and become friends forever,
Look! Mr. Zafar.
I really respect you but I will
kill my daughter,
before it happens,
For this alias even nature is
giving you signs,
Look! Such a nice co-incidence,
His son's name is Mustafa,
and your daughter's name is Aaisha,
Such a nice Sunnah is fulfilling,
My three more daughter's names are
belong to Prophet's wives,
Shall I give all of them to
his Mustafa,
Listen! You stupid Hakim,
Your Aaisha likes my Mustafa.
In my enmity,
don't break these kid's hearts.
I'll drop my all conditions,
Just find a nice guy who would be
ready to simply marry in Mosque.
I can't give dowry to my
daughter but...
My daughter...
is good from her face.
Now I have only condition as soon
as possible...
it should be done,
Not in months...
but in days.
Will you compromise for age?
He must be younger than me,
What are you saying?
She is a human being,
Not a mess that we will throw her
and somebody will pick up.
Look at her age,
You are about to make miss match,
It's not a miss match as well what
she wants to do.
Before she got some wrong step
like Saliha,
I should get her married, Enough!
I don't need argument,
Marriage is on Friday after Maghrib,
He born you,
He have right to decide,
He born humans not medicine bottles,
that he will give it to anyone.
I won't do it.
Gentlemen! I am requesting to
Committee Members...
that they should keep sited
after prayers,
We have stopped many decisions
for waiting Mr. Sheikh,
The biggest problem is
Hakim's problem,
You have told committee many times,
that you get the cashier responsibility
back from him,
Mr. Sheikh has...
agreed to take this responsibility,
That's why tomorrow after Namaz Asar
in our next meeting,
Hakim will bring all the accounts,
and he will present to committee,
This committee is thankful
to Hakim,
Now the second problem
is construction,
Wherever is was possible I asked
all of them last time,
Still 1.75 lacs...
you apologize to committee and
tell them truth,
Tell them you will pay them
in few days,
Kill me instead of giving me
this stupid idea,
My father served 32 years and I served
40 year...
then we got some respect in this city,
You want me to ruin all
these years,
What I am going to listen just
think about it,
Tell them where you go to teach,
Why would they will give me such
a huge amount,
In return I should leave this witch
to their house,
perhaps they will give me,
They won't pay single penny for me,
If you make their packets then,
Shut up!
For God Sake it's not a time for anger,
I am not telling him to beg,
They have enough money,
They can buy our house immediately,
If they can't buy then put
on mortgage,
Hakim!
You are here on this time,
God! Please solve my
daughter's problem,
Zainab told me,
I don't understand what to do.
I don't know why this man
is so cruel.
I have a solution in my mind,
but I am afraid,
If I will tell you...
then you might won't listen.
You just tell me.
Have your breakfast,
Money will be arrange,
It will be arrange?
Yes!
I have one condition,
what you have told that's
all truth,
Why would I lie to you,
I really got some...
I am not talking about that,
7 daughters?
Not a single son,
If you would be one of us,
then this time you will be
a millionaire,
I am such an unfortunate man,
God made a son's queue after
a single daughter,
After 5th son...
I have to stopped,
1.75 lacs is such a huge amount,
But my house worth's more
than that,
Look! I don't need your house,
I am coming to the point,
You...
will have to give me one daughter,
You...
Sit! I am not talking about that
what you thinking,
God keep your daughter's respect,
I am not talking about them,
Allah gave you such quality,
if this discussion will be
reveal here,
then other women will chop me
to achieve you,
I don't understand,
Which quality?
You can born daughters...
Man like you is like a diamond
for us,
Running bank account,
I don't understand.
Tell me clearly,
You have to born a daughter,
Specially for me,
you will be a father and my meena
will be mother,
I am giving you advance payment
for upcoming daughter,
What rubbish you are thinking about?
Who told you?
That it's in man's reach to born
daughters,
My business runs from daughters,
If we won't this thing then who
else will know it,
You Hakim and Moulvi people.
Refused every scientific method in
beginning,
It has been proved that son and
daughter born by men,
And woman can't do anything
about that,
you can confirm to any doctor.
Suppose I am agree with you,
then you tell me,
if it will be son...
then you can keep it,
you will get a support for
your old age,
This is my dignity,
Otherwise I could say that if son
will born,
then you will have to return
my money,
I didn't said it, It's a gamble,
to see your record I feel to
play this game, Just for a baby,
such a huge amount, One baby?
From one baby with pretty face,
our generation gets changed,
As much money you are asking,
it's just an amount of one
dance program,
Take your decision under
banking hours,
How far the mosque from here?
It's two step ahead,
I am agreed,
But I have only one condition,
I don't know about your tradition,
but I will purely marry with her,
It's done,
Shall I arrange the money?
Yes!
You will have to swear on Quran,
that nobody will ever find me
about,
I was looking for you,
Our women don't care about customers
age and faces,
But Meena is a different girl.
I am afraid if she will see you
like this.
She shouldn't refuse to get marry,
You are becoming groom,
so you should looks like groom,
Why are you amazed?
Meena is a nice girl.
We have a nice client Malik Sahib,
He already got booking,
She is with him,
But she will take her dinner
with you.
You take some rest.
I saw your foot,
They are very nice,
Don't put them on floor,
they will be dirty,
You?
Meena!
I am helpless it doesn't mean,
that you will mock with me,
Why did you think that I am
mocking with you?
I am sure it's like that,
In that accent you are speaking why
did it need here,
And what you said about my foot?
I think you haven't seen Pakeezah,
Otherwise you would appreciate me,
Who is this Miss. Pakeezah?
It's a movie,
You didn't see that.
I don't watch movies,
I thought you must watch movies,
You are getting confuse for nothing,
I think...
that whore must be from Lacknow,
otherwise she should born in
some decent family.
Now introduce your self.
My name is Shafat Khan,
I will order some food,
Do you sleep in this Sherwani?
He is also our family member like
you are now,
Meena will sleep till afternoon,
You should note down today's date,
that day lot of sweet came to house
but Nisa didn't touched that,
I am scared that's why I don't like
to eat it.
Think there must be one of us,
who will live her life happily.
What disaster will come here?
No disaster will come,
What will happen?
Here comes disaster.
Now you tell me shall I bring
you stick or...
Kerosene and some light,
Because I have made a big mistake,
but I think allot and did,
And I am ready for any punishment,
What have you done now?
Because I didn't want that you do the
same with Aaisha what happened with me
that's why I forced mom and...
I got Aaisha's marriage with Mustafa.
If she will die then you will
listen to me,
What kind of man you are?
You are putting extra pressure on me,
President don't forgive death sentence
on my proposal.
Who is asking forgiveness?
I am saying stop it,
I mean if case will re-open then I'm
sure she will get forgiveness,
I know this girl is innocent,
you have been summoned,
It shouldn't happen tomorrow,
That day for your feet,
I said beautiful words,
but you didn't say a signal word
for me,
My feet are not so good.
Your foot is like when you walk,
then slave's row should walk along to
put their palms under them,
It's another thing that you didn't
said from heart,
Why are you saying like that?
My feet are next to you,
but I don't know where are
your palms,
If these palms are permanently
available,
then your feet will come
along with me,
wherever I take them,
You don't have to leave your
daughter here,
that's why you want to take
me along,
But I am saying it all for you,
I got married with you,
you are my respect,
Marriage was your only need,
otherwise there is no
tradition here,
Is it possible for you?
That you leave your family
and go somewhere,
forever,
They have no man except me,
who earns, and here...
no woman is here except me,
echo earns...
You didn't answer me,
They will do job,
They will become an officer
in some office,
they will open their clinic or they
will become a minister,
or ask that witch what she wants
to let them do,
What an illiterate girls will go
outside and do,
do you have any idea?
We wanted to become your support.
I am feeling pity on you,
that you are so alone,
How our house condition will change?
That's why I needed a son,
but all of witches keep coming,
and who made this raw?
We didn't insist to born,
You should stopped after 2 kids,
You made this raw,
and you are blaming to Allah,
What are you saying?
I am right,
I can see a rebel in her eyes,
Rather I will kill her,
or I will die,
from her hands,
Yes! I am sure you are
making excuses,
Actually! You are afraid to awake
him at this time,
But I am telling you if you
won't awake him,
then I will shout on my channel,
Are you threading me?
Yes! I am threatening you.
A person will die,
and you are worried about President
of Pakistan's sleep.
After all who he is?
He is a God! Okay!
You don't get emotional,
I will do something,
Mustafa become a doctor,
then he and Aaisha brought many
gifts and sweets.
Entire family thinks like life
will start now.
We have to steal little happiness.
And we have to lie to hide them,
To hell with these media channels.
Now journalists will decide who
is innocent,
You shouldn't awake for this
stupid thing,
This girl didn't said a single word
in any court for her defense,
All witnesses were against her that's
why she got death sentence,
I don't know why this girl didn't
open her mouth in court,
but my heart is saying that this
girl is innocent,
Your heart says many things,
but government...
doesn't run from your heart,
You don't know what's going to
happen with you,
When this recording will run on
TV and entire country will cry for her
then I will shout and say that I tried
to save her till last time,
but the president's sleep were
important than this innocent girl.
This girl won't survive now but
you will also not save.
Your debt is over now,
It's a baby,
You are lucky,
just make a deal with me,
I gave you 1.75 lacs for this girl.
2.75 for next girl and
3.75 for another next girl.
You just keep giving me daughters and
I will increase lacs.
You go out,
Leave all the jobs.
Take me out from this situation,
She is my blood.
For your late mother's sake.
Give her to me,
I will take her and go somewhere,
Before they will know,
I will leave this city.
We pimps are better than you.
At least we fulfill our promises.
You didn't think about your respect
when you were taking money,
You can take my house in
return of your money.
What pain she felt for nine months,
Who will pay for that?
If I will ever see your face again,
then I will bring your all
daughters here.
And run them for Rs. 10.
It's been 3 days.
Dad wasn't eating something,
nor he was talking to someone,
The worst part was that...
He also missed his prayers.
Finally...
this secret has revealed,
Mom! Some woman has come.
Hakim is at home?
Yes, he is upstairs.
Who are you?
I am Meena.
Take this baby to Hakim,
Where are you going?
Dad! Come out please.
What's going on?
Who is she?
I don't know.
That woman gave her to me
and gone.
I kept stopping her but she
didn't listen.
What's the matter?
Some woman has come and she
left this baby,
You go over there!
You come inside.
Who she could be?
I don't know.
I am also thinking about that.
Daughters will listen,
I will tell the entire world.
That's what you have done for me,
You kept us prisoner in home,
and having fun outside.
Shut up!
Think about your face,
How would you face Allah.
He will return your all worships.
I am warning you if you will
tell the daughters.
What happen?
Tell me who was she?
She was your dad's second wife
A whore,
she came here to drop your
8th sister.
That woman didn't stay here
because of us.
You go and bring her back,
Because we all are leaving this
house in morning,
I will kill all of you if anyone
will step out from the house,
We will step out from the house.
And stop threatening to kill us.
It shouldn't happen
what you couldn't do amongst one
of us will do.
I don't know about others,
I have thought many times,
Rather I will burn myself along
with all sisters,
or I shall kill you.
Kill me,
I am telling the truth,
If you will try to lock us in
this house,
then I will really kill you.
Instead of this baby...
I will drop you in that market,
Dad has beaten Baji.
This is our last night in this hell.
Tomorrow morning we all will
leave this place.
Take this baby from here.
You look over here,
Shannu! You go there.
You come with me,
What happen to Hakim?
I killed him,
Where is our baby?
Dad killed her and threw away.
You didn't miss any place?
There are only two rooms,
Time is over,
I can't delay anymore.
If the dawn will come then I will have
to postpone it till tomorrow,
Close your cameras,
Pick up your mic's from here,
I got revenge from my dad,
My father didn't born 8 kids but
he killed 8 kids
I want to leave a question behind me,
And I want...
that all of you ask this question
to this society,
The question is that,
Why only killing is a crime why
not to born?
Think about it,
Ask it?
Explain to people.
Don't born more beggars,
We already have crying faces,
When you can't feed then why
did you born?
Zainab has left us and gone,
Who is responsible for that?
That father who born Zainab,
but he snatched her life,
or those beaurucrate officers who could
not dare to awake President,
Or Mr. President is responsible.
Who gave this impression to
his staff.
That his sleep is important than
some Zainab,
Call a meeting,
Sir! What will be the agenda,
Why killing is a crime not to born?
