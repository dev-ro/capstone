AYRTON'S MOTHER

All the dangers are my biggest fear.
I would like to thank him
because he is a good son
and this year he has worked
very hard and honestly.
For me, it is more important than any title.
The time has come.
Ayrton is ready to ride in a Formula
One car for the first time.
I believe it was God
who gave me this opportunity,
I've been waiting for a long time.
And now it is helpful
to remain calm, tranquil, relaxed.

Ayrton, this is a beautiful city,
with wonderful streets to walk,
but unsuitable to host a race, no?
REGINALDO LEME
Indeed. I arrived at the last minute
and I was surprised.
I've never been to Monaco.
I did some testing
and fortunately, I managed
to adapt to the track.
There is no margin for error,
any error would result in an accident.
But for now, I'm satisfied.
I was travelling a lot, as a
Formula One journalist
when Ayrton began to be noticed
driving a Toleman.
VOICE OF REGINALDO LEME
GLOBO TV COMMENTATOR
Toleman was not a winning team.
The car was bad and never won a race.
That's why what Ayrton did in Monaco
was true genius.
Ayrton Senna overtakes Keke Rosberg

Incredible!
Ayrton raises his arms
and gestures with enthusiasm!
Celebrating as if he won the race!
If we had continued for a few more laps,
I am sure Ayrton would have passed him.
I had a serious chance of winning.
But until you cross the finishing line
in first position,
it is impossible to make a prediction.
Formula One is politics, money
and while you are making your way through it,
you must deal with such things.
Ayrton Senna
the new star of Formula One!
Appearing for the first time
on the Formula One podium
after a fantastic performance.

AYRTON'S SECOND RACE WITH LOTUS
Ayrton was exceptional when it rained.
REGINALDO LEME
GLOBO TV COMMENTATOR
When the conditions were bad
and the track became slippery
he had a higher gear.
The Estoril race was incredible.
He lapped all his opponents except one.
It is wonderful!
An extraordinary feeling.
I am very happy because,
in my second year in Formula One,
I managed to fulfill my first dream,
which was to win my first Grand Prix.
It is something unique.
It was raining really hard.
There was no competition, really.
He would have won that race if it was run 100 times.
It was an important race for
Brazil for many reasons,
including the fact that on that day,
the first elected Brazilian President,
Tancredo Neves, died.
It was a very important
political moment for Brazil,
because he was the first elected president
after the end of the dictatorship.
He was ill for a long time and died.
There was a risk that Brazil
would suffer another blow
or something like that, which nobody wanted.
Senna's win was very important
in that sense,
for the public, for the Brazilian people
and for us there,
and I'm sure he also realised this
later in the evening
when we were at dinner. We went to dinner,
but later that night after leaving the
restaurant he caught a plane to return to Brazil.
MILI OKADA
FUJI TV
I think many Japanese girls are fans of Mr. Senna.
Now I am close to him
and I'm so nervous...
At that time the strongest teams
were Williams and McLaren.
McLaren was,
I would say, a constructor
which had always reflected
the same values as Ayrton.
In that sense Ayrton and Ron Dennis
had much in common.
They were both perfectionists...
Let's put it like this. Both have
the idea that nothing will go wrong
if something is well planned and executed
and have always fought
by the same ideals.
Ron comes from a background of hard work.
He has struggled to get where he is now
and has been successful in life.
They are both very close.
At that time the trilogy "The best
team, best driver, best car"
was led by Ron Dennis at McLaren.
ALAIN PROST

SELINA SCOTT
WOGAN TALK SHOW, BBC
In Formula One your teammate
is your biggest rival,
the first person to beat
because he is the only one who
has a car equal to your own.
I can have the excuse that I run in the
McLaren and the Ferrari is better
or I can be in the Ferrari when the
McLaren is better, but I can't say
that my Ferrari is different
from that of my teammate.
Usually early in his career
when a driver arrives in a team
his main rival is his teammate.
If he goes fatster than his
teammate has a chance to move on.
If he doesn't accomplish this,
it's the end of his career.
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE MCLAREN DRIVERS
RON DENNIS

The first year at McLaren was a very

VIVIANE SENNA
AYRTON'S SISTER
He was very nervous.
It was as if he bore the weight
of the world on his shoulders
because he now had the responsibility
to demonstrate he was
a first rate driver.
Before Senna arrived at McLaren
Alain Prost was considered the destroyer
of teammates.
I remember Jo Ramirez said to me:
"Reginald, I am very concerned
"What will happen
with Ayrton at McLaren.
"I know he has talent,
but Prost is a fighter,
"He creates an atmosphere of war
"Which helps him to destroy his opponents,
"As he did with Keke Rosberg."
Using the word "destroy"
in the technical sense.
Destroyed on the track,
beating his opponent mentally.
I said to Jo Ramirez:
"Jo, with Senna it will be different.
"Because he has more
talent than the other drivers
"Prost will look to divide the team."
And that's what happened.
Alain Prost was scared.
Despite all that Prost had
in terms of talent,
understanding of a race, intelligence
and cold blood, he was surprised
when he began racing with Ayrton.
He would never have thought
a driver could be as good as Ayrton was.

The order of the grid is always one or the other.

The decision taken by the

After the race, a giant screen has
repeatedly shown the incident

enable Senna's return to the track.

in Formula One,
I was involved in football,
World Championships, Olympic Games
and worked in many other areas,
but I've never seen a rivalry
similar to that between Ayrton and Prost.
It was a rivalry involving everything.
There were criticisms,
especially by Prost,
in relation to the behavior of Ayrton as a person.
Two of the greatest champions
in the history of Formula One
ended up in the sand.
Championship ruined.
They accuse each other,
but Prost was the hardest.
His reaction was violent.
I wanted to punch him in the

that I did not succeed.
It makes me feel sick.
The situation in Brazil

ANNOUNCEMENT OF WILLIAMS DRIVERS
For Ayrton Senna, it is
a race against time.
He has to attune himself to be an integral
part of the team and adapt to the new car.
He says he is not yet comfortable.
The car no longer has the electronic
components used last year.
He is without traction control, special
brakes and active suspension.
The cars are much less stable
without the electronically controlled suspension.
As a result, they are more difficult to drive
and it is very likely that more cars will leave the track.
So we might see more cars crashing,
giving more excitement to the audience.
Also for us, as long as nothing happens to the drivers.
Otherwise, it is not a good situation.
