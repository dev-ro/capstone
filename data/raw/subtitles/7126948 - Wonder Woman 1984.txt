Some days,
my childhood feels so very far away.
And others,
I can almost see it.
The magical land of my youth,
like a beautiful dream of when the
whole world felt like a promise
and the lessons that lay ahead
yet unseen.
Looking back,
I wish I'd listened.
Wish I'd watched more closely
and understood.
But sometimes you can't see
what you're learning
until you come out
the other side.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
I'm gonna miss out.
I've seen this contest
humble even the most
seasoned warriors, Diana.
I can do it.
Just do your best.
And remember,
greatness is not
what you think.
Pace yourself and watch.
No!
No!
That's not fair!
No.
No. But...
- You took the short path.
- But...
- You cheated, Diana.
- No.
But that...
That is the truth.
That is the only truth,
and truth is all there is.
But I would've won,
if you didn't...
But you didn't.
You cannot be the winner,
because you are not ready to win,
and there is no shame in that.
Only in knowing
the truth in your heart
and not accepting it.
No true hero is born from lies.
Your time will come, Diana.
When?
When you're ready.
Look to the
Golden Warrior Asteria.
She did not become a legend
out of haste.
She did it through
true acts of bravery.
Like patience, diligence,
and the courage
to face the truth.
One day, you'll become
all that you dream of and more,
and everything
will be different.
This world is not yet ready
for all that you will do.
Welcome to the future.
Life is good,
but it can be better.
And why shouldn't it be?
Everything we've
ever dreamed about
is right at our fingertips.
But are you
reaping the rewards?
Do you...
...have it all?
Slow down, dude.
No way.
Dude!
Welcome to
Black Gold Cooperative.
- Oh, my gosh. Guys!
- The first oil company
run for the people,
by the people.
Think about finally having
everything you've
always wished for.
Let's go!
Hey!
For a low monthly fee,
you can own a piece
of the most lucrative industry
in the world.
And every time we strike gold,
- you strike gold.
- Oh!
No matter who you
are, no matter what you do,
you deserve to have it all.
Do you have everything
you've ever wanted?
Aren't you tired of
always wishing you had more?
- Hey, move it. It's my turn.
- Join me today.
- Yes!
- Operators are standing by.
You don't need a pile of money or
some business degree to get started.
You don't even have
to work hard for it.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Don't even think about it.
At Black Gold
Cooperative, all you need
is to want it!
We get what we want,
and we go.
- What do you want?
- None of this junk.
Word is on the street
you got a nice little black market
side business going on back there.
If you don't tell,
we won't tell.
Yes, yes, yes!
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, yes, yes!
Sir, are you all right?
Gun!
He's got a gun!
Shut up! Please!
Come on, dude. Can't hide.
Let's get out of here!
Stop! Mall Security!
No, no, you, you, right there!
Right there! Freeze. Stop!
Move, move, move!
Chief, they're running up
the escalator.
Hey! Stop! Freeze!
Freeze!
No!
We have several
armed assailants running free.
We need the police here,
right now.
Freeze!
Freeze!
Freeze! Freeze!
Whoa, whoa! Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No. Dude, dude, calm...
- Get back, man. I'll do it!
- Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm not going back!
- No, no, no!
Just chill out.
Just chill.
- Stand back!
- Don't do it!
No, no, no!
Put the kid back.
Listen to me.
Listen to me!
- No!
- What are you doing?
Pull her back.
Pull her back in!
I'm not going back!
No!
Gonna let her go!
- No, no, no!
- No, no!
What? Who? What?
We won't be doing that today.
Whoa.
We... We... We should go...
Oh, my gosh!
Hold tight.
I hate guns.
We've got to go now. Come on.
Yo.
I'm sorry, lady.
- Shh.
- I'm sorry. Okay?
It was his idea.
And the
authorities still have questions.
In fact, the first is
a real doozy, which is,
who exactly
even stopped this crime?
If the story around here
is to be believed,
it wasn't the police,
but a mysterious female savior
that multiple witnesses saw.
If this sounds familiar,
it should.
We've now had more than
a half-dozen similar sightings
across the greater D.C. area
in the last year.
Which, of course,
begs the biggest question of today,
who is this woman
and where did she come from?
Excuse me.
Are you waiting for someone?
No. Just me.
Taxi!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.
Hey, we could share,
if you like?
No, thanks. I'll wait.
Oh, my.
- Yeah.
- Hey, Jake.
Jake, hi. Can you...
Hi. I know, walk much?
The latch of my...
Good morning.
Hi. Thank you.
Diana Prince,
cultural anthropology and archaeology.
Barbara Minerva.
Geology, gemology, lithology,
and part-time cryptozoologist.
Oh, wow.
I kept busy in college.
Sorry. It's these heels,
you know. It's stupid.
I don't know why I was gonna wear heels.
Scientists don't wear heels.
- Sometimes we do.
- Right.
- Right. Those are cool!
- Have a nice day.
I like those.
Animal print.
Do you want to get lunch?
I, uh...
Not now, obviously.
It's morning.
But later today, or whenever.
Like, around...
Like, at lunchtime?
I have a lot of work today.
- But maybe some other time?
- Oh.
- Yeah, I'm busy today, too.
- Great.
Ah! Diana, do you happen to
know who a Barbara Minerva is?
Oh, hi, Carol. Hi.
It's me. I'm Barbara.
Remember? You hired me.
- Started last week.
- Oh!
Gemologist?
Yes. And zoologist.
- We had a couple interviews.
- Yeah.
Well, the FBI are gonna drop off
some artifacts later this afternoon.
The FBI?
- Yeah. Yes.
- They're coming here?
The mall heist yesterday,
apparently they were using
a jewelry store as a front.
Front for what?
Black market. Stolen jewels and
art meant for private buyers.
But we could use your help
identifying one in particular.
My help?
Yeah, I'll help the FBI
with whatever they need.
Is that a yes?
Yes. I would, um...
- I would love to assist you.
- Wonderful.
It's nice to meet you.
We've met.
Have a nice day.
Bye, Diana.
Okay, item number 23.
Shoot. That's not it.
Oh, the Empress of Siam.
Originally found in the wreck
of the Nuestra Senora de Atocha.
Wow.
Sorry. I couldn't resist
coming to see.
Oh, it's okay.
Here it is.
- What is it?
- Um...
Uh...
I can't tell.
Some light.
I think the technical term here
is "extremely lame."
Um...
It's... It's citrine.
A classic stone used in fakes
throughout history.
I can't imagine this is worth
any more than $75.
What do you think?
Fakes aren't my forte,
but let me see.
Mmm.
Latin.
At least
it's an antique, right?
Or a purchase from a stall
on the Ponte Vecchio last week.
- Mmm-hmm.
- You never know.
"Place upon the object held
but one great wish."
You read Latin?
Yeah. Yeah.
Languages are a hobby.
So maybe it's, like,
a lucky charm or something?
Yeah, I guess.
Strange.
I really wish I had a coffee.
You're funny.
Hey, I got Erika a coffee, but she's
out sick. Does anybody want this?
What?
Yeah, I'll take one.
Ooh, hot!
Hot, hot!
Did you see that?
Oh...
Can you imagine?
- If only.
- Hmm.
So many things,
I don't even know what I would wish for.
I do.
Well, um, anyway,
sorry to bother you.
If you need anything,
I'm around.
- Oh, yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah.
But thank you for...
That's okay. It's my job.
And I'll look into it more
when I have a chance.
Okay.
Well, thanks for...
talking to me.
I'm... I'm sorry, uh...
I mean, I'm fine.
You know, we could go
and grab early dinner
and talk about exactly
how lame that stone is.
Really?
Yeah, I mean, citrine?
Who are they kidding, right?
- So lame.
- Dorky.
- Lame.
- Yeah, let's go.
That's, like,
the lamest of lames.
Wow. You're so funny.
- Oh. Thank you.
- Wow.
I mean, no one's made me laugh
like this in such a long time.
I mean, it's true,
I don't get out much socially.
You don't get out much?
No, not really.
- No.
- I'm sorry. I'm just surprised.
Because you just seem like
the kind of person
who's, like, always out.
Like, people are asking you
to go out all the time
and you live out.
You're just out.
Like, you never get in.
You just seem
like you'd be really popular.
And I would know because
I've never been popular.
You haven't?
You're so personable.
So... free.
I mean, honestly,
I gotta say that I envy that.
What?
You envy me?
That doesn't make any sense.
Oh, my gosh.
People think I'm weird.
They avoid me
and talk behind my back when
they don't think I can hear them.
I'm like, "Guys,
I can hear you."
Barbara, my life
hasn't been
what you probably think it has.
We all have our struggles.
Yeah, we do.
Have you ever been in love?
Uh... Yeah.
- A long, long time ago.
- Mmm.
You?
So many times, yeah.
All the time.
Often.
So what happened?
Where'd he go, your guy?
He, uh...
He died.
But I still think sometimes that
I see him up there in the sky.
He was a pilot.
- Oh!
- He was all kinds of things,
but he was great. It was true.
I get it.
Well, cheers to us.
Wishing us better luck,
I guess.
Hey, Leon.
Hey there, Barbara. Late night?
Yeah. Going back to work.
I wanted to bring this to you
while it was still hot.
- Oh, you're too good to me.
- It's not a problem.
Stay warm.
Hey there, sweetheart.
You need some help?
No, I'm fine. Thank you.
'Cause, uh,
you know, you look as though you're
having a little bit of trouble
walking in those heels, huh?
It's okay. I wear
these heels all the time.
Hey, come on.
Let me walk you home.
- I'm not going home.
- Hey, I'm just trying to be nice here.
Huh? Come on.
Hey, hey. Hey, hey!
- What are you doing?
- Hey, hey!
Let go of me!
- I'm just trying to help you!
- Let go of me! Let go of me!
Let go!
Forgot my keys. Lucky.
- How did you...
- Simple self-defense.
Used his own momentum against him.
I'll teach you.
Honestly, it takes
no power at all.
Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good.
- Thank you.
- Of course.
Go home, okay?
- Yeah.
- Good night.
I do know what I'd wish for.
To be like Diana.
Strong, sexy,
cool.
Special.
Oh...
Oh, no! Oh!
Sorry.
Oh, it's okay.
Barbara, thank God
you're good in heels.
Oh.
- Hey, Barbara.
- Hi, Jake.
Wow. Looking good.
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.
This is our
Earth Sciences lab.
Oh, Barbara!
Hi.
Perfect.
I have someone
I would like you to meet.
- A pleasure, Ms. Minerva.
- Oh.
Uh,
it's "Doctor," actually.
Um... Have we met before?
You look familiar.
- Do the thing. Do the thing.
- No.
Life is good,
but it can be better.
Oh, my gosh. From TV.
Oh, my gosh.
You're the oil guy.
- "The oil guy." I'll take it.
- That's right.
Mr. Lord is considering
becoming a Friend of the
Smithsonian at the Partner level.
- Oh.
- Which entitles him to a handful
of private tours
of our facilities,
and he asked for you by name.
- Me?
- Well, what can I say, Doctor?
Your reputation precedes you.
And apparently we share
a passion for gemology.
- Wow, okay. We do.
- I'll leave you to it.
Uh...
Oh, let me just drop this off
in my office,
and we'll go.
Oh! Oh, gosh. Don't look in there.
It's such a mess.
So, I thought maybe
we could start upstairs.
I love that ruby.
Oh, no. Be careful with that.
- What?
- That's very...
Hey, have you seen
my friend? Where'd he go?
- I'm right here.
- You are.
Thank God.
Oh, wait. You've got
a little dust on you.
- Sorry.
- Hey, good morning.
Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- Oh! Uh...
This is the one and only,
Mr. Maxwell Lord.
It's him.
Life is good,
but it can be better.
He's from TV.
Oh, I don't have a TV.
Well, I have a great
relationship with Sears.
I can get you a brand-new TV
by the end of the day.
Nineteen inches.
- No strings attached.
- I'll stick to the one I don't have.
But thank you.
Okay.
You're so generous. Um...
Headline... Uh...
Mr. Lord
took a tour
of the entire Smithsonian
while considering partnership,
and guess
what he decided to do?
Give his entire donation
to our department.
He's announcing it
at tonight's Members' Gala.
It's going to be
an amazing party.
I hope you have
something nice to wear.
I actually tend
to skip these events.
I find that our benefactors with
a true eye towards philanthropy
prefer to stay
out of the spotlight.
To let the museum's work
garner the attention.
I agree.
Except,
I like to party.
Oh, my gosh.
You're such a good dancer.
- You like Latin dancing?
- I love it.
I know that
I'm a terrible dancer.
No, I doubt that
you're a terrible dancer...
No, I've got a hip injury
from high school.
...the shape that you're in.
Great, so,
- thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, yeah.
You know,
I really should be going.
Thank you for the tour.
I will have to see you tonight.
See you tonight.
Bye. Have a good day.
I'll find you.
What?
I like him.
Thank you, John.
Ladies.
Mr. Lord.
Mr. Lord.
Not now, Raquel.
My supplements?
On your desk,
but Mr. Lord.
Mr. Lord.
Mr. Lord.
Mr. Lord.
Mr. Lord.
Dad!
How?
How!
It's your weekend.
Yes, clearly.
Alistair.
Where's the pool, Daddy?
It's not done yet, buddy.
But it doesn't matter.
You just have
to be patient.
I told you the pool,
the helicopter,
you'll have it all.
But remember,
Rome wasn't built in a day,
was it? No.
Hasn't it been
a lot of days?
Well, it takes time
to become a great, great,
number-one man,
like your dad is going to be.
Are you lying to your son,
like you lie to everyone else?
Simon.
These offices aren't ready
for guests yet.
It's over, Max.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I'm out.
Alistair, go wait with Raquel.
Simon.
I know it's hard
to see right now,
but we are finally right at the
edge of turning this thing around.
"Turning it around"?
There is no oil.
There never was.
So how are you gonna
turn it around?
Get more
sucker investors, like me?
- It's called a Ponzi scheme.
- No!
I have a big...
There's something in the works.
And it's no scheme.
Simon, we have millions of acres
of potentially oil-rich land.
You have oil rights on land
that everyone else
passed on already.
Now, it didn't take
much digging
to find that out.
I should have
done some digging on you, too,
Maxwell Lorenzano.
Didn't take long to find out you're
nothing but a lowlife con man.
I am not a con man!
I am a television personality.
And a respected businessman
- with a plan.
- Come on.
- With... With... With a great plan.
- Oh!
"If you can dream it,
you can have it."
Something like that?
You have 48 hours
- to get my money...
- You're going to regret this.
...or the FTC gets an anonymous report.
- Loser.
- Simon, wait.
Simon, wait.
I am not a loser.
He's a loser!
And don't you ever believe
a word that man said.
He's a liar...
and he's wrong.
And he will rue the day
he walked away from me.
And you...
You are going to be so proud
to be my son.
Okay.
You'll see.
Everyone will.
These are known
for a terrific fit.
Yeah, I'm just
not so great with heels.
Just try them.
Come out and show me.
Okay. Hmm.
They do fit well.
Ah.
Huh.
- Yeah, I like it.
- You look
amazing.
Do you think it's too tight?
I think it's just right.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
I'll take it.
Hey there. How are you doing?
- Those shoes are incredible.
- Thank you.
- What a beautiful dress.
- You look fantastic.
Thank you so much.
Dr. Minerva.
You look breathtaking.
Thank you.
I... You know, we have to go to
these sort of things for work a lot,
so I've probably worn this
dress a million times.
Mmm.
Um...
- Actually, no.
- I...
I just bought this today.
I never look like this.
Um, not even close.
Took me a long time
to get ready.
Biotin.
You should try it.
Makes you glow like a teenager.
Reverses the clock.
Never accept
the limitations of nature.
Yeah, no.
Especially not
a beautiful woman like you.
Oh...
God, it's so loud in here.
Yeah.
Can we go somewhere?
- Just me and you?
- Yes.
Hmm... Your office?
Oh, wow! Look at all
of this stuff. It's so...
It's so beautiful.
Like you.
What is that?
Um...
Uh, it's nothing special,
really.
But the FBI did ask me
to help them identify it.
Wow.
Though it certainly
has me stumped so far.
Let me help you.
Max is here. No need to be
stumped ever again.
I have a dear friend
in Roman antiquities.
- Roman antiquities.
- Could give it a look, if you like?
It is Latin, isn't it?
I really shouldn't let it
go out of the museum.
- Hey there, beautiful.
- No, thank you. Excuse me.
Oh, Diana.
Hoping I'd see you.
Hey, do you know
I'm at the White House now?
Yeah, that's right. Interning,
but requested by name, so...
Listen, I've had my eyes on you
for some time.
- So if you ever need...
- That's great, Carl.
Diana.
Diana.
Excuse me, I don't even know
you, so please stop following me.
- Good night.
- But...
I wish we had more time.
Why did you say that?
Don't say that to me.
You don't even know me.
Yes, I do.
I can save today...
but you can save the world.
Steve?
Diana.
But how?
I don't know.
Oh, my God.
It's you.
I missed you.
So what do you remember?
I remember...
I remember taking
the plane up...
Mmm-hmm.
...and then...
nothing, really.
Nothing.
But somehow, I know
I've been someplace since then.
Someplace that's, uh...
I can't really put words to it.
But it's... It's good.
And then I, uh...
I woke up here.
Where?
I ended up in a bed. Uh...
Strange, strange pillow bed
with slats.
- A futon, yeah.
- A futon?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Well, not comfortable.
And really a bit backwards
if I'm being
really honest with you.
I mean, for a futuristic time
like this. Nineteen...
Eighty-four. 1984.
That's amazing.
Would you like
to see my futon?
Yeah. Um...
You don't have to tell me.
The place is a mess.
Cheese on demand.
I spent all morning
cleaning his bedroom,
but he seems to me
to be an engineer.
Lots of pictures of himself.
Not what I would do,
but to each his own.
Oh, so this is
how you found me.
Yeah, the phone book.
I guess some things
are just future-proof.
So you went to my apartment?
Yeah, I tried to use
the bike at first.
I couldn't really figure out
how to get it going,
so I ran over
and saw you come back.
And I was stunned.
There you were.
So I just, uh...
followed you, like a creep.
Diana, look at you. It's...
It's like not one day
has passed.
I can't say the same thing
about you.
Right, right, right.
Right.
Yeah, he's, uh...
He's got it.
No, I like him.
He's great,
but all I see is you.
"One great wish."
I've been waiting.
I wish to be you.
The Dreamstone itself.
Hi.
Come here.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Been eating Pop-Tarts
all morning,
and I've had about
three pots of coffee.
This place is amazing.
- This place?
- Yeah.
You know,
if I really think about it,
I don't think I've ever been
in a room more amazing.
- It's true.
- Yeah.
This room is
the most amazing place
I've ever been in,
in my entire life.
It's the most
amazing place, right?
So let's stay. We shouldn't go.
- I really don't want to.
- So, let's not.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Let's just stay here.
Let's just stay here.
Forever.
Although...
I should probably go
and figure out
how a stone brought my boyfriend
back in someone else's body.
That's a fair point. Let's go.
Whoa.
Mr. Stagg?
Thank you, Belinda.
Oh, God.
You'd better be here
with my money.
I'll have your money, Simon.
Today, I'm here for an apology.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not going to apologize.
I'm sorry.
I messed up. I messed up.
I lied.
And I'm sorry.
You know, the truth is, I knew we
were going to sink a long time ago.
The wells were coming up dry.
And no data suggested
that was going to change.
I should have folded then.
But all the people that bought
in, that believed in me.
- I wanted to do right.
- Oh, come on.
Max, look, you don't have to...
Simon, don't you understand
that I wished for better?
That with every ounce
of my being,
I wished that Black Gold would
change the world for all of us.
And I know
you wished that, too.
Of course I wished that, too.
Then your wish is granted.
And in return,
I'll take all of your shares...
and full control of Black Gold,
after you are somehow magically
removed from my path...
- You're gonna what?
- ...forever.
Max!
Hey, Max!
- Get back here! Max!
- Ow.
What the hell is going on?
We have a warrant
for Simon Stagg.
My word. Are we in danger?
No, sir.
Federal taxation crime.
It doesn't concern you.
Move along.
Send them through.
- Okay. Follow me.
- Let's go, guys.
Ooh.
So you said a stone
started all of this?
Yeah, that's what we need
to go and find out.
I mean, it must have
done something.
This is dynamite.
What do you think?
- Yeah. Yeah...
- Huh? Right?
I saw a couple of magazine pictures.
They roll these up.
I think we can do better.
Look at all the pockets in this.
There are pockets here.
There are pockets
all over the pant.
American issue bag, adjustable.
Parachute pants?
- Yeah. Uh...
- Does everybody parachute now?
You know,
I'm not so keen on this one.
I figure you are, but you know
what, I'm ready to go.
Mmm-mmm.
- Right?
- No.
- You're not even giving it a second.
- It's not good.
"Too much" in a good way
or a bad way? Right?
- In a bad way.
- Oh.
Now that's great.
It's beautiful.
Yeah. I would absolutely
never wear it.
- I feel like a pirate.
- Steve.
Who would wear this?
Diana,
have you seen these shoes?
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Let's keep the shoes. Yes!
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Yes!
This is a special one, okay?
- Let's do this together.
- Uh-huh.
One foot after the other.
Now stay on this one.
Go to the middle.
No, Steve...
Steve, you're gonna fall.
I really thought
I was gonna fall.
What's up?
This is break dance.
- Dancing?
- Yeah.
- Whoa!
- Oh, don't worry.
- It's fine. It's just a move.
- Yeah? Oh.
It's nothing.
It's all art.
Yeah.
Uh... That's just a trash can.
It's just a trash can.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Is that a plane?
Come on.
I want to show you something.
This is incredible!
And every time we strike gold,
you strike gold.
Think about finally having
everything you've always wished for.
Raquel?
Raquel?
Black Gold. Can you hold, please?
Black Gold. Yes. Hold, please.
- Raquel?
- Hold, please.
The wells struck pay!
- Which ones?
- All of them.
And the investors
heard about it somehow.
They're calling to up their buys.
Their friends are calling to buy in.
New investors are calling
out of thin air.
Hold on, please.
I need more help.
- Black Gold. Can you hold, please?
- I'll get you help.
Tell me again.
You wish you had more help?
Yes, I wish I had more help.
There are just
too many calls to take.
Uh... Hi.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm meant to be interviewing
at an accounting firm.
- You're hired!
- Oh...
Welcome aboard!
- Emerson.
- Emerson!
Is this the employment office?
Yes! You're hired, too!
Mr. Lord,
it's Wall Street Journal.
They want to interview you
about company's sudden surge.
I'll take it in my office.
And bring me my vitamins.
So I did read
about four books last night...
...to try to get to the bottom of this.
And did find out, Roger, you were right.
This is from the Song Dynasty.
You were correct.
And also interesting,
I was looking at a couple of
encyclopedias last night and you...
Thanks. Um...
So funny, all this reading seems
to have cured my eyesight somehow.
- Interesting fact which we...
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Good morning.
This is Steve. He's my, um...
- Old friend.
- Yeah.
Hi, old friend Steve.
I'm Barbara,
Diana's new friend.
So what do you do?
I'm a pilot.
- Pilot? Isn't that...
- Can I speak to you for a second?
Sure.
So, I just wanted to speak
to you about that stone.
The citrine one.
- Do you have it?
- Uh...
Long story, actually,
about that.
Max Lord came by
to visit yesterday.
Which was actually
pretty great.
I'll tell you
about it later. Um...
I let him
borrow it.
What? Why?
Well, Diana,
he just gave us
a huge amount of money.
It's not like he's a stranger
or anything.
Plus he has a friend who's an
expert, and I don't know...
What do you mean?
How could you loan it?
- It's not even ours to loan.
- Whoa. Whoa.
What are you getting
on my case for?
I've got 15 things in my office
more valuable than that stone.
Do you know where he took it?
No, I have no idea.
Then I'll tell you
what we find out.
Let's go.
- I like your pants very much.
- Oh, thanks.
Yeah. Call me.
Or not. Whatever.
But I'd be curious.
Call the Black Gold hotline.
Shares are not available
in the building.
What are these people doing?
Whatever it is,
we're not getting in that way.
Diana. Diana, this way.
Have at it.
Strong lock.
Steve.
- It's so dusty.
- Yeah.
It's like a bomb went off.
Whatever this is,
he's been looking for it for a long time.
"Place upon
the object held."
What is it?
The language of the Gods.
Which God wrote it,
is the question.
Thanks.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. It's okay.
I gotta go do something. Okay.
I'll talk to you. All right?
- Hello?
- Barbara, I need your help.
I need you to find out
exactly where
that stone was found.
"Where" is what I need to know.
You understand?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
Thanks.
You look like you saw a ghost.
I did.
There were many Gods
and they did different things
for different reasons.
One was making
objects like this.
There are universal elements
in this world,
and when they're imbued
into something,
they can become
very, very powerful.
Like my Lasso of Truth.
The truth is what powers it,
not me.
The truth is bigger
than all of us.
But what is this?
I don't know. Uh...
Brought me back.
Love or hope...
maybe?
Maybe.
Well, whatever it is, I can promise you
this is too powerful for Maxwell Lord.
We need to find this guy.
Uh...
Look at this.
If this date's right,
he's going to Cairo.
Cairo?
Yeah.
Growth opportunity, you know?
"King of Crude"?
How is this so fast?
You have a plane that can fly
from here to Cairo in one shot?
That is amazing.
Yeah, but we can't get you on one
because you don't have a passport.
I don't want to get on one,
I want to fly one.
I want to fly the plane.
I want to fly this plane.
Yeah?
Oh, my Betsy.
Hey, Steve, this way.
Yeah.
Look at these gams.
You wanna choose?
This one.
I like it.
Okay.
Okay. Uh...
No.
Uh...
All right. Good, good.
Fuel, fuel, fuel.
Here we go. Engine.
Here goes nothing.
Oh...
- Ken?
- What?
There's an aircraft
on the runway.
What do you mean,
"There's an aircraft on the runway"?
Approach, this is Tower.
There's an unlisted aircraft
on the runway.
Are you seeing this?
- Can you get us up there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I just have to pick up
speed first,
and then I'll take off.
The way I fly,
they will never find us.
- Oh, I forgot to tell you.
- What?
Radar. I can't explain now,
but they'll see us anywhere,
even in the dark.
Well, will they shoot at us?
- Well, shit, Diana.
- Right.
- Diana.
- Wait. Shh! I know.
I know. Focus.
Focus.
My father hid Themyscira
from the world,
and I've been trying to learn
how he did it.
Did what?
Made something invisible.
But in 50 years,
I've only done it once.
Well, now's not a bad time
to start trying.
- How long does it last?
- I don't know.
It was just a coffee cup...
and I lost it.
Approach,
the aircraft has vanished.
Do you have eyes on it?
An invisible jet.
What's that?
Oh, it's okay.
It's just fireworks.
The Fourth. Of course.
The Fourth of July?
Wow.
I got an idea.
You know, it's the one thing.
The one thing
that's always been you to me.
What?
Flight.
Your gift.
I'll never understand it.
Ah, it's...
It's so easy, really.
It's wind and air
and knowing how to ride it,
how to catch it.
How to join with it.
Yeah.
It's like anything, really.
Great, thanks.
Found the last one.
This should keep you busy
for a while.
Anything else I can get you?
Coffee?
Tea?
Me?
I don't need anything from you,
and I'm done.
You're done?
Hey, you don't have
to be mean about it.
Hey, babe.
Where you going?
No thanks.
Ooh, you're pretty.
Hey, slow down, sexy.
You talking to me?
Yep. I'm talking to you.
Why don't you just
slow down a bit, huh?
Come on, girl.
I'd rather not.
You know what I mean?
I'd rather not have anything
to do with someone like you.
I'd rather you stop
harassing people.
Like me.
Do you remember me?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I remember.
Where were we, huh?
No.
No.
No.
She's right.
It's not that hard.
Yeah, I think I get it now.
His body weight
does do all the work.
So easy.
I think
I could do this...
all...
night...
long!
Barbara?
What are you doing?
Mind your business.
Sir?
Your fortune the last few days
has been impressive, to say the least.
But why come all this way
to meet with me? Hmm?
To meet a peer.
A peer?
No, Mr. Lord. I only agreed to meet
with you because I was curious.
No one gets that lucky.
How did you do it?
On my journey
to self-fulfillment...
I lucked into a secret.
The secret of the wish.
So I wished for it.
Or someone
wished for it for me.
Tell me what you wish for,
Your Highness,
and I will show you
how it works.
I wish for things
one cannot attain.
Like what?
All of my land to be returned.
My ancestral realm.
The Bialyian Dynasty.
And for all the heathens
who dare trod upon it
to be kept out forever,
so that its glory may be renewed.
You wish for that?
I wish for that deeply.
Your wish is granted.
And in return,
I will take your oil.
You truly delight me.
You know so little.
I sold my oil to the Saudis.
You are a silly man.
Then I will take
your security team
and leave you here
with nothing to defend yourself
against the wrath you most
certainly will face.
Stop! Stop the car!
What are you doing?
Stop what you're doing now!
I'm telling you.
I command you to stop!
Stop!
Stop! Stop!
This
unbelievable and unexplainable wall
appears to somehow be the work
of Emir Said Bin Abydos.
The government is reporting
old rulings have emerged
acknowledging his claim
to the land.
You okay?
I'm fine.
You keep saying that, but...
That was him!
That was Max Lord.
Get rid of them, please.
I got this.
What?
Diana!
The brakes still work.
Max Lord,
you're putting yourself and
everyone else in grave danger.
I need you
to give me the stone.
What happened to it?
You're looking at it.
Whoa!
Steve!
Diana!
So who's the next
closest person with oil?
Diana. Diana.
My God.
What's going on with you?
A truly bizarre phenomenon
that is being called the Divine Wall.
What is happening?
It's an unexplainable event
that now sees
Egypt's poorest communities
entirely cut off from their
only supply of fresh water.
An already
tense situation now escalating
as the Soviet Union announces they
will recognize the Emir's claim.
- Oh, no.
- The United States,
a longtime ally of Egypt,
has declared
their intention to side
with the government.
Bedlam on the home front
now as well
as the shocking news
that American businessman
Max Lord has somehow
come into possession
of over half
of the world's oil reserves.
The instability in the
oil community has resulted
in a nationwide run on gas,
and experts are girding themselves...
Hello?
Barbara, it's Diana.
- Did you...
- Yeah. Uh, well, sort of.
I haven't figured out
exactly what the stone is,
but I've found
historical images of it.
From where?
That's the weird thing.
From everywhere.
It first appeared in the Indus
Valley almost 4,000 years ago.
It popped up again
in Carthage in 146 BC.
Kush, 4 AD.
Romulus, the last
Emperor of Rome,
he had it on him when
he was assassinated in 476.
The last record is in some
previously unknown dead city
near Dzibilchaltun.
- The Mayans.
- Yeah.
Anyway, it just led me
to a bunch of dead ends,
and my last lead
is not that promising.
What's that?
A flier I found.
Grabbed it at the embassy.
Some guy advertising
to be a Mayan shaman.
But he literally teaches a course
in a squat next to Galaxy Records.
- And he knows about the stone?
- So he says.
I'm gonna go there
in the morning.
Okay, we'll meet you there.
And thank you.
What is it?
The stone has
traveled the world
to seemingly random
and different places,
- but they all have one thing in common.
- What?
Their civilizations collapsed
catastrophically.
Without a trace as to why.
You don't think
the stone could have...
Do you?
I don't know
what to think, Steve.
I can only hope I'm wrong.
Babajide?
- That was fast.
- Morning.
Hello.
One second.
So you're a Mayan?
What? I'm a citizen
of the world.
It says your name is Frank.
Yeah. Most of what I know
is a past-life thing.
So that's a no.
But to answer
your question, yes.
My great-great-grandfather
left me this.
I don't know everything about
it, but I have been warned
I'm better off that way.
What I do know is,
it destroyed our people
in a matter of months.
The few survivors,
they buried the stone,
never to be exhumed
under any circumstances.
- Can I see that?
- Be my guest.
What?
What is it?
Dechalafrea Ero.
What's that?
A very bad God.
The God of Lies,
Dolos, Mendacius,
Duke of Deception.
He's been called by many names.
But if he's the one
who empowered that stone,
there has to be a trick.
What do lies have to do
with granting wishes?
It seems more like
a Dreamstone to me.
Wishes with a trick.
"The Monkey's Paw."
Beware what you wish for.
It grants your wish,
but takes your most valued possession.
Diana, your powers.
No, that doesn't
make any sense.
What's more precious
than what you wish for?
How do we stop this?
The legend said
it can only be stopped
by destroying the stone itself
or give back what was given.
My people couldn't do the first thing
and refused to do the second.
Now the culture's destroyed.
Wiped from the face
of the Earth.
- No one renounced their wish?
- But the stone is already destroyed.
What? When?
"You're looking at it."
"You're looking at it." That's
what Max Lord said to me.
Maybe it's him.
He's become it somehow.
But how would
that happen?
I mean, if he wished for...
No, that's crazy. No.
If we destroy it,
if we destroy him...
all the wishes go back.
What are you
talking about? No.
I'm not gonna be
a part of that. No.
Or if everyone
renounces their wish.
No, there has to be
a better way.
No.
She's right.
We don't know enough.
We just don't know enough.
But what we do know is that we need
to stop him before he grants any more.
Stopping him might
not be enough, Diana.
Wishes have been made.
Barbara?
Barbara?
Like I want any of
these people in the club anyway.
Can we tell them
they're not invited?
No, sir.
- The FCC said we couldn't...
- Oh, the FCC.
The BBB, the FBD.
It's a conspiracy
against my success.
They're jealous. That's why.
Who's next?
- Who's next?
- Well, everyone you asked for,
Lai Zhong, Mr. Khalaji,
- that televangelist who stole your slot.
- Mmm.
And you have Alistair
for the night.
Alistair? Again?
How many weekends do I have?
What? What? When?
Tonight?
He's here already.
His mom is with her boyfriend.
Send in Mr. Zhong, please.
And buy Alistair a pony.
No! A race car.
Get him a race car.
Let's get to it, Lai.
Tell me...
what do you want?
What do you wish for?
- Me? Truly?
- Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
The Soviets have sided
with Iran.
Iraq is preparing to defend
ourselves, as unrest spreads.
And you need? What do you...
What do you wish for?
Consider the sex tape gone.
And God darn it,
if I have to keep doing this
one by one, by one, by one...
- How's your health?
- Well...
Forget that.
But I will take
your entire congregation
and your time slot.
Let me ask you,
when they pray,
is there any way
I could get all of them to...
join hands with me?
And simply say, "I wish"
rather than, "I pray"?
Would that even work?
I don't...
I need to find a way
to touch a lot of people
at the same time.
Sir. The police are here.
They're challenging the
jurisdiction of your security team.
Oh, God!
This isn't working.
Bring in someone new.
And my son.
You, beat it.
Alistair!
I've missed you, buddy.
Come. Sit down with Daddy.
I'm sorry.
But, your dad is on the absolute
precipice of everything.
Remember when I told you
that I would be number one?
Do you remember? Your dad?
Well, I'm inches away. Huh?
I know it's hard. I know.
But listen,
I also know what you wish for,
and I wish for it, too.
Do you hear that?
I wish for it, too.
I just wish
I could be with you...
No!
You don't use your
one wish like that, Alistair.
You don't wish for something
that you already have.
You wish for greatness,
for success.
That's why
I'm doing all of this.
Don't you see that my greatness
is your greatness? Huh?
Then I wish for your greatness.
No. No!
Thank you.
I love you so much.
And I promise you, one day,
everything is going
to make sense.
And one day, you'll thank me.
But right now, I, uh...
Right now, I need you to stay here
with Emerson, okay? I'll be back.
You stay here.
You. You.
Yes, sir?
Don't you wish I had an audience
with the President today?
Of course I do.
And can I tell you how happy I am
that you value my opinion, sir.
Wait a minute.
Have I asked for your wish before?
Yesterday. A Porsche.
What is it with you aides
and Porsches?
You!
Hi.
This way.
How's traffic?
Huh? Terrible.
Don't you wish it wasn't?
And that everywhere you went
parted like the great Red Sea?
Of course I wish that.
Sadly, ain't gonna happen.
Hey, you! Stop!
Come on in. It's not safe.
There's a riot
at the Saudi Embassy
and there are Porsches
racing up and down the street.
Come on. It's mad.
But my cows.
I told a man I wanted a farm.
I didn't mean here.
I'll be right back.
Diana, I know it's been hard.
You don't know. You don't.
But we...
It can't go on like this.
- I can't talk about this.
- We have to talk about it.
Steve, I can't talk about this!
I give everything I have,
every day.
And I'm happy to.
But this one thing...
You're all that I've wanted
for so long.
You're the only joy I've had
or even asked for.
I am so sorry...
but that's crazy.
There's a world
out there full of
so many better guys, for one.
I mean, how about this guy?
How about him?
I don't want him. I want you.
Why, for once, can't I just
have this one thing, Steve?
This one thing.
I'm not sure we have a choice.
Well, I do have a choice.
And I can't give you up.
I can't.
So I won't.
So we need to stop him
so we can figure that out.
There has to be another way.
Has to.
Wow.
This is incredible.
What's that?
From my culture.
The armor of an ancient Amazon warrior.
One of our greatest.
It's huge. This whole thing?
What is it made out of?
Here. Let me show you.
Give me your hand.
What are you talking about?
I haven't lied.
The Lasso does more than
just make you tell the truth.
It can make you see it, too.
Her name was Asteria.
She was our greatest warrior.
When mankind enslaved the
Amazons, my mother freed us.
But someone had to stay behind
to hold back the tide of men
so the others
could escape to Themyscira.
My people gave up
all of their armor
to make her one suit strong
enough to take on the whole world.
And Asteria sacrificed herself
for a better day for others.
That's...
That's incredible.
When I came here,
I searched for her.
But all I could find
was her armor.
What is this?
Where is he going?
Oh, no.
Diana, Diana!
What are you doing?
- Where are you going?
- Steve, I'm going. You need to stay.
No. No. Listen to me.
You're getting weaker, Diana.
- What if you fall?
- I won't.
You might. We don't know that.
There has to be another way in.
Everything okay, Mr. President?
Yes.
Something very strange. I...
I thought I was somewhere else entirely.
Suddenly...
Anyway. Hectic times.
Give us a minute.
Excuse me.
- Carl.
- Diana.
- Hi.
- What a pleasure.
Good to see you.
How have you been?
- Good.
- This is Steve.
Steve, this is Carl.
My colleague.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Shall we, uh...
Yeah, we shall.
I'm sorry, Mr. Lord.
In fact, I don't even know
what we're supposed to discuss.
Exactly that, Mr. President.
These hectic days,
hectic times.
And you.
These aren't
exactly my favorite
of the busts on display here,
but it's a little picture of my top
ten, maybe top five at a push.
Oh, here's something up ahead
that will interest you.
These are floor tiles originally
laid by none other than Jan Lincoln,
a little-known descendent
of Abraham.
You're having some troubles?
Everywhere suddenly.
Cuba, Egypt,
even here.
But Russia...
- very troublesome.
- Mmm.
I appreciate your concern,
but all the money in the world
won't help us now.
It's not money I'm offering.
You.
You are a man of faith,
and I have been
very blessed lately.
I want to share
my blessing with you.
The power of positive thinking.
Now...
tell me, Mr. President,
what do you need?
And you're not speaking to me
here, but to the universe.
What do you wish for?
What is there to wish for but more?
More nuclear weapons.
More than they have.
Closer to 'em.
If I just had that in place,
then they would
have to listen to us.
A nice thought.
And I grant you...
Oh... Oh, my...
And you know what I'd like?
I would want all of your power,
influence, authority.
All the respect you command
and the command
everyone must respect.
I mean, what else is there?
Now, tell your people
I would appreciate
absolutely no interference
whatsoever.
No taxes, no rule of law,
no limits.
Treat me like a foreign nation
with absolute autonomy.
Very good, sir.
Right away.
What's this?
Global Broadcast Satellite.
Top-secret program
that enables us
to override any broadcast
system in the world
in case we need direct contact
with the people of an enemy state.
So what does that mean?
You're taking over
everyone's TVs?
How?
It uses
particle beam technology,
just like
the Star Wars program.
Apparently, it bathes the landscape
in a signal of particles that goes in
and fiddles with
any technology it touches.
New or old.
Broadcast whatever you want.
Very impressive.
You said "touches"?
As in the particles
you are sending...
are touching everything?
It's a figure of speech,
but yes.
- That's how it was explained to me.
- I need immediate access
to this satellite.
And a chopper
to get me there.
Yes, sir. Right away.
Well, aren't you resourceful?
Come with me before you do
any more damage, Max.
No. I don't think so.
Remove this woman, please...
permanently.
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.
No, Steve. You can't use that.
It's not their fault.
That's neat.
Barbara.
I can't let you do this, Diana.
Barbara. What...
- How...
- I can't let you stop Max.
You're not the only one
with something to lose.
Turns out wishing
to be like you...
came with some surprises.
Hands up.
- Hands up.
- Hands up, hands up.
Hands up!
- Hands up!
- Now! Now, now!
Open fire!
Oh, how sweet,
defending your love. Huh?
What do you wish for?
Do you wanna be a real boy?
No.
Just not to be handcuffed to
you, but now I am.
I just learned that.
Barbara, stop!
Ahh!
Listen.
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.
I'm not what you think.
You can't possibly
understand or handle...
Oh, I can't
possibly understand?
Oh...
Dumb little old me.
Dumb little, poor little
nothing, nobody me.
I couldn't possibly handle it.
No, Barbara.
That's not what I'm saying.
Well,
I'm handling it beautifully.
And I'm not giving it back!
Go.
Run!
Everyone, stand down.
Nobody hurts her.
They couldn't if they tried.
You've always
had everything,
while people like me
have had nothing.
Well, now it's my turn.
And you are not taking it from me. Ever!
But what is it costing you?
What is it costing me?
If it's the monkey's paw,
it takes as much as it gives.
Yes, you're strong...
but what did you lose, Barbara?
Where's your warmth, your joy,
your humanity?
You're attacking innocent men,
Barbara. Look at yourself.
Forget about me.
What is it costing you?
Yeah, yeah.
That's right.
Get used to it.
If you go after Max Lord...
or hurt him in any way,
I will destroy you.
Barbara!
Are you all right?
Room for one more?
Sir, you need to wait.
The President has
a meeting right now.
We need
to see the President.
He needs to be told.
- This is a matter of life and death.
- What is going on?
The Soviets' early detection
system picked up our new nukes.
What new nukes?
A hundred warheads just went
online, ready to launch.
They're taking this
as an act of war.
Prepping to return fire.
Return? What?
We haven't done anything.
That's not how it looks.
And we'd fire for less.
Are you kidding me?
You blew through that light right there!
You didn't even see!
How do you not see that?
Riots across
the world erupting
as America and the Soviet Union
end communication,
declaring war!
No one knows
any more than that.
But as you can imagine
with what's at stake,
there has been
madness down here
in downtown Washington, D.C.
The national guard
has been brought in...
Attention! Attention!
By executive order,
all civilians
must immediately evacuate the
Pennsylvania Avenue corridor
between 3rd
and 12th streets northwest.
It is the final days
of tribulation
that is happening to us now.
Can you see
what your sinfulness has done?
Your greed?
You gotta do something!
You gotta do something!
Come on! This way! Come on!
Riley!
All units.
Riley!
We need help.
- It's chaos out here.
- Riley!
What do you want me to do?
I don't know what to do.
Somebody help me.
I don't know what to do.
Diana.
Diana, listen to me.
I had a great life.
Steve...
And you only made it better.
But you know
what you need to do.
The world needs you.
- All right?
- No.
Yeah.
I'll never love again.
I pray that isn't true.
There's a wonderful,
big world out there.
This crazy new world.
And I am so happy
I got to see it...
but it deserves you.
I can't say goodbye.
I can't say goodbye.
You don't have to.
I'm already gone.
I'll always love you, Diana,
no matter where I am.
I love you.
I renounce my wish.
It's easy.
It's only wind and air...
and how to ride it.
How to catch it.
You made a wish too, huh?
They're a bitch, aren't they?
Make you pay a price,
but I've never been one for rules.
Luckily, I have a way
to reverse it.
The answer is always more.
But you only get one wish.
But I, my dear,
grant the wishes.
So I take
what I want in return.
There's nothing in this world
someone doesn't have.
I'll rebuild my health,
wish by wish, organ by organ...
if I have to.
I'll be invincible.
Tell me,
what do you want?
I'm feeling generous.
I don't want to be
like anyone anymore.
I want to be number one.
An apex predator,
like nothing
there's ever been before.
I like the way you think.
Go on.
You heard we were
coming, I presume?
How many broadcasting signals
can I take over at once?
Well, as many as you like, sir.
I'll take all of them.
All of them?
And I sure wish this works
for me. Don't you?
Yes, sir.
Lights, camera...
Okay, stations 12,
9, 16, go transmit.
I need it now.
16, 9, 12. Do you receive?
Copy. Maximum power.
Okay. Moving forward now.
Global transmission in five,
four, three, two...
Citizens of the world,
allow me to introduce myself.
I am Max Lord,
and I'm here
to change your life.
All you have to do...
is make a wish.
Anything you want.
Anything you dream of,
you can have it.
If you can dream it...
Daddy?
...you can achieve it.
So just look into my eyes...
and make a wish.
Anything you dream of,
have it.
Right now.
Do you want to be rich?
Do you want to be powerful?
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever you say.
- Say it out loud!
- You know what I wish?
- What? What?
- I wish all you Irish bastards
would get sent back
to where you came from!
Yeah? Well, I wish
you'd drop dead!
Look around you.
Make your wish!
Take what's yours.
Whatever you want,
you can have it.
I wish for a million dollars.
Wish for it.
Anything you want.
Anything you dream of, have it.
Yes.
I can hear it.
I hear you.
Yes, say it.
Say it out loud.
That's right.
"I wish."
Take it.
Take it. It's all yours.
It's all yours for the taking!
And I... I take your health
and your strength.
Give her your rage
and your prowess.
And I take your power.
I take your life force.
Yes.
Yes!
That's right.
You're doing great.
It's all yours.
I wish you were here, Daddy.
I wish you'd come back.
Daddy, please!
- All you have to do is wish for it.
- I'm still here, Daddy.
Daddy, please!
Barbara.
What did you do?
No.
You renounced your wish.
I had to. And so do you.
Nothing good is born
from lies, Barbara.
We're wasting precious time.
Even now, patronizing me.
Barbara...
I know you're in there. Please.
Please, renounce your wish.
It's over.
Please!
Renounce your wish.
Never!
Then I'm so sorry.
That's right.
Just wish for it.
It's yours now.
All you have to do is
say it out loud.
Make a wish. Any wish.
Look into my eyes,
and everything you've been waiting for,
it's all yours.
You're too late.
Granted.
Granted.
Granted.
Granted!
- Granted.
- Why are you doing this?
Don't you have enough?
Why not more?
Why not wish for more?
But they don't know
what you're taking from them.
We want what we want.
Just like you did.
So make a wish.
Very good.
Granted.
It's too late, Diana.
They already heard me.
Already wished!
And those that haven't yet...
oh, they will!
Granted.
Granted.
Granted.
Poor Diana.
Why be such a hero?
You could have kept your pilot
and your powers,
if only you'd join me.
Wanna reconsider?
I'm a forgiving man!
You want him back?
Just say the word.
You can have it all!
You just have to want it!
I've never wanted
anything more.
But he's gone...
and that's the truth.
And everything has a price.
One I'm not willing to pay.
Not anymore.
This world was a beautiful
place just as it was...
and you cannot have it all.
You can only have the truth.
And the truth is enough.
The truth is beautiful.
So look at this world...
and look at what your wish
is costing it.
You must be the hero.
Only you can save the day.
Renounce your wish
if you want to save this world.
Why would I...
when it's finally my turn?
The world belongs to me!
You can't stop me. No one can!
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to everyone else.
Because you're not the only one
who has suffered.
Who wants more.
Who wants them back.
Who doesn't want
to be afraid anymore.
Or alone.
Stop!
Cut the signal! Stop!
Or frightened.
Or powerless.
'Cause you're not the only one
who imagined a world
where everything was different.
Better.
Finally.
A world where they were loved
and seen, and appreciated.
Finally.
Oh, my God. Who is he?
He doesn't even speak English.
What is he eating?
Look at his shoes!
Weirdo!
But what is it costing you?
Do you see the truth?
Daddy!
Daddy!
The Russians are launching.
We've got orders to counter.
All right, all right.
Alistair!
Emergency alert.
You have four minutes
to find shelter.
Alistair!
My son!
Stay calm
and stay indoors.
Alistair!
Daddy! Daddy!
Help me, Daddy!
This is not a test.
Daddy!
Daddy!
One-minute warning.
Wait. My son!
I can see my son!
Save him, Max.
I have to save my son.
Daddy!
Alistair.
Daddy!
Daddy!
My... Alistair.
I renounce my wish!
I renounce my wish.
We have missiles
disappearing, sir.
Yes, sir.
They are vanishing
from our screen.
Only just hearing
now that a ceasefire
between the Soviet Union
and the United States
has averted
a global nuclear crisis.
I renounce my wish.
- I take back my wish.
- I renounce my wish.
Alistair!
Alistair!
Alistair!
Daddy!
- Daddy!
- Alistair!
Alistair.
Oh, Alistair, Alistair.
I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm so glad I wished you'd come.
I knew it would work.
No.
That is not why I'm back.
No.
I've been lying to you.
I'm not a great guy.
In fact, I'm a pretty
messed up, loser guy.
And I made terrible mistakes.
But you...
you don't ever have to make
a wish for me to love you.
I'm here because I love you.
I just...
I just wish and I pray that,
one day,
I'll be able to
make you proud enough
that you'll be
able to forgive me.
And love me.
Because I'm nothing
to be proud of, Alistair.
I don't need you
to make me proud.
I already love you, Daddy.
You're my dad.
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
So beautiful.
Sorry.
Just talking to myself.
It's all right.
It's just that...
It's wonderful.
It's so many things.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
I like your...
I like your outfit.
You like...
Thanks.
You know, my friends...
they kinda tease me about it,
but it works, right?
- You look great.
- Thank you.
You just made my day.
- Happy holidays. See you around.
- Happy holidays.
So many things.
So, so many things.
- Whoa!
- Look out!
Oh, my God.
- Mom, would you take her?
- Yeah.
Um, excuse me.
Excuse me. Please,
you have to let me thank you, Miss...
Asteria.
Asteria. Wow.
That's a beautiful name.
It's from my culture.
I can't thank you enough.
I mean, you saved my daughter.
How did you do that?
It's just a simple shift of weight.
Takes practice.
But I've been
doing this a long time.
