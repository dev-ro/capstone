(Siddharth) Fearlessly. Daringly.
(Siddharth) And his mind is a little --
(train whistle)
(indistinct chattering)
The stakes are higher this time.
The cops are on high alert.
250 for pole touch
500 for sliding.
1000 for the parapet.
And rooftop.
-How much?
-Twenty.
Twenty?
-Twenty what?
-Twenty thousand!
Because it's a dangerous stunt.
All go, no show!

Okay, deal.
But...who's up for it?
(Siddharth) Who else?
(Siddharth) I will.

-Do your job properly!
-I am doing it, Mr. Dixit.
Dixit!
The cops nearly arrested me today.
They should
lock you up forever.
If you keep this up,
all my pension money will be spent
in getting you out of jail.
I am your son.
You don't have any other choice.
-What did you say?
-Hey, Siddhu.
When is the next stunt?
Right now.
At home, with my father.
-Want to join me?
-Hello, uncle.
Hello, uncle.
He is a kid, uncle?
A kid?
I've grown old waiting for him
to grow up.
You have started again.
Youth is a feeling.
Don't blame me
if he doesn't feel that way.
Look at Dhoni.
At the age of 32,
he lifted the World Cup.
What did you do?
Do you want me to lift something?
There you go.
-Siddhu.
-You fool!
God made you a natural sportsman.
Had you played for the country,
you would have got a job, a medal.
And pension after retirement.
The outcome of the game you want to play
is death, son.
Nothing more.
And no one knows that
better than us.
People are dying out there anyway.
Except for a few games,
all one gets is a metal cup
and a couple of medals.
You do know who I'm talking about.
Brijesh Dixit!
My father.
He bagged three bronze medals
in the Commonwealth.
And now, he worries every day
for his son's salary and pension.
Stop it, Siddhu.
Sport is my passion.
I don't want my photo
in the newspaper,
but I want to see the sunset from
a skyscraper.
Honestly speaking, father.
I want money, that's all.
-Siddhu.
-Come on.
-I'll give you money.
-Listen.
-You want money, don't you?
-Listen to me.
-Don't interrupt.
-Please don't do this.
-Siddhu.
-You keep quiet.
Siddhu, what is going on?
-(cupboard opens)
-Please don't pay attention. Please!
You want money, don't you?
Here's the money.
Pick it up.
Take it!
And go buy that dream house of yours!
Pick it up.
Can't touch it, can you?
Your brother also
went after this money.
Only the bag came back.
Since then,
none of us touched this bag.
Neither you nor me nor her.
(Brijesh sobbing)
Why?
(Brijesh sobbing) Speak up, Siddhu.
(Brijesh sobbing) Why?
Siddhu, where are you going?
Siddhu. Siddhu.

Do you want to take an exit from life?
Not exit, sir.
We want to enter.
Oh really?
Where?
Tell him.
Shrikant sir,
there are places
where people let go of themselves.
And there are places where
they redeem themselves.
Maidaan.
It's a world of extreme sports,
where players from all over the world
risk their lives to compete. Do you know?
The stakes are so high,
that even your calculator
will fall short of numbers.
My true love!
Bro, our true love.
Is this a playground or a superstar?
But how to get there?
It's simple, uncle.
Keep uploading such videos
on the internet.
They will watch and send an invite.
They will send an invite,
to both of us.
We'll enter the Maidaan,
conquer it,
and give everyone
a tough fight.

Hey, Philip.
How was your date last night?
-It was good.
-Good.
Let's play.
Since when have you
been dating the police?
You see.
God doesn't need a reason to kill.
But I have one.
Only one.
Betrayal.
(indistinct sirens wailing)
(indistinct chattering)
Your informer is dead.
You put him there.
You are responsible.
Sir, we all know these races,
these games,
this Maidaan is illegal.
These junkies
are no national threat.
Sir.
Dev.
This man is responsible for
smuggling something dangerous,
into our country.
Maidaan is just a cover.
I'll figure that out with the Interpol.
You stay out of it.
No more informers.
Understood?
(waves sound)

Uncle.
Who are you selling balloons

You.
I'm past the age

Only the game has changed, son.
And the Maidaan (playground).

Sir, Siddhu...

Got arrested again?
Not this time.

Two more boys died today
while doing gimmicks on top of the train.
Are you aware?
I'm out of words, uncle.
(female announcer) The afternoon local train
(female announcer) heading from Ghatkopar to Panvel
-Go look someplace else.
(female announcer) witnessed two more deaths
of boys performing stunts.
(female announcer) The boys were of 16
and 18 years of age.
(female announcer) Both the boys belonged
to Ghatkopar's Gangawadi chawl.
(ship honking)
I knew you would show up.
Are you alright?
I am if you are there.
Siddhu, why did you come to Maidaan?
Go back to mom and dad.
Look at me.
I came here as a living-breathing
human being.
And now, I am drifting
as your conscience.
I came here so that you don't have to drift.
If I win, you will attain salvation.
Don't preach your elder brother.
(container's door opens)
Go fulfil your dream.
(Male staff) Guys, come out.
Our dream.
Alright, guys.
Get in the trucks.
This side in here,
this side over here.
Let's go.
Move it.
Morris. Africa.
Siddhu. India.
Butter chicken.
(Dev) Hello.
(Dev) When the whole world
plays in light,
(Dev) we play in shadows.
(Dev) Let me tell you what is Maidaan.
(Dev) Today,
I will tell you what Maidaan is.
(Dev) Maidaan is a home.
(Dev) From today it's your home.
(Dev)  Maidaan has only one ideology.
(Dev) Which is freedom.
(Dev) The freedom you have all been
searching for in your free countries.
(Dev) But have been unsuccessful so far.
(Dev) Because we all know
(Dev) freedom comes at a price.
(Dev) That's why,
(Dev) I am giving you
a chance to earn it.
(Dev) So that you can go back
to your free country
(Dev) and buy it.
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.
Welcome to the most-watched event
in the world!
Welcome to Maidaan!
(all cheering & whistling)
As the saying goes,
"Everything is fair in love and war".
(foreign language)
(foreign language)
All is fair in love and war.
Maybe.
But not here.
Because there are rules.
The rules you follow
are the rules I follow.
And those are the rules of Maidaan.
(door opens)
(Dev) We are your passport and your visa.
(Dev) We make the law and the rules.
(Dev) The system and the procedure.
(Dev) Because at Maidaan,
(Dev) your safety is our concern.
(Dev) And beware,
(Dev) Maidaan has many enemies.
(Dev) It's my duty to keep them away
from you.
(Dev) So you'll be allowed to go
on the other side of the gate.
But once you're on this side,
there will be no phones.
(Dev) No one from the outside
can contact you.
And you cannot contact
anyone in the outside world.
(Dev) Never take off the bracelets
given to you.
(Dev) Where, how and what you are up to.
(Dev) We will always know every detail.
(Dev) We watch everything.
So please don't do anything stupid.
Three races.
800 million.
(Dev) The player who wins the first race
will win 160 million.
(Dev) 240 million for winning
the second race,
(Dev) and 400 million for the third race.
(Dev) Any player who wins
all three races in a row,
(Dev) will win 800 million.
This year,
the player who wins
maximum races
will be Maidaan's champion.
And he will get another chance.
To double his winnings.
The challenger race.
And you've to play with me.
And if he defeats me,
then money is one thing.
He will get fame
and respect,
which none of you must have
ever imagined.
But if he loses,
then his winnings
will become zero.
Zero.
And once again, players.
Welcome to Maidaan!

Who can challenge death?
The one who is worthy,
will reveal himself.
(device beeping)
They have just announced
their upcoming contestants.
I'll call you back.
(Patricia hangs up)
Anyone interesting?
Yes. Number 10.
Siddharth Dixit.
He has a history of Maidaan.
What history?
His brother Nihal Dixit,
competed in the finals
four years ago against Dev
and died.
(music continues)
Alright, listen up.
One night of fun.
(car comes to a halt and the door opens)
Now remember, guys.
It's rules before drools.
Meaning if you break the rules,
he'll break your neck.
What is your role here?
I handle the betting.
I am the bookie of Maidaan.
Junaida.
So what's my rate?
That depends on you.
Whether you are eliminated
or you dominate.
But make Mother India proud,
please.
Speaking of mother --
You must have a phone.
Good evening, gentlemen.
The most crucial element
of making a nuclear bomb.
Plutonium.

Once the advance is received,
the main consignment will be delivered.
(phone ringing)
Mom.
Siddhu.
Where are you?
I can lie to you if I want.
But I won't.
I am in another country.
Same place where brother went.
(Siddhu's mother) Brother?
(Brijesh) You didn't listen.
Siddhu.
I did, father.
To myself.
And yes.
I am sorry
for whatever happened the other day.
Another thing.
This time it won't be just the bag.
-I will come back too.
-He will get me killed.
Idiot!
Come on.
-I'm hanging up.
-Quickly.
Listen.

He will gallop like an Arabian horse.
He will gallop so hard

But if she makes up her mind,

She is tough, man.
It's my turn.
Who is she?
Who's next?
Come. You want to face me.
-Come.
-Alia.
-Come, let's go.
-She is the influencer of Maidaan.
Who is going to face me?
You?
God, it's hot.
Hey!

Let's go.
(Crowd) Alia. Alia. Alia. Alia.
India? Poland?
Where are you from?
For now,
I am beyond your reach.
I am in love with you, girl.
That's how an Indian is.
A slight distraction and
an accident occurs.
Hey, listen!
I like girls who are
beyond my reach.
You are perfect!
Leave it.
Stop trying.
You won't get it.
What?
Number.
You won't get my phone number.
It's all you boys think about.
From the moment I saw you,
my mind has become numb,
and my buddy down there is awake.
Excuse me?
Look.
I meant my mind up here
and my heart down there.
My heart is awake.
What did you think?
Whatever.
Anyway.
I'll see you at the race.
Bye.
I'll be the only one you see
at the races.
I promise.

Good luck, man.
-Happy to see you.
-You too.
Freaking sissy.

-Who are you betting on?
-Siddhu!
-Number 10!
-Let's go.
Team India!
(Crowd) Maidaan! Maidaan! Maidaan!
(Helicopter engine)
Welcome to Maidaan!
Okay, let's make some money.
(Dev) Thirty-two players chosen
from around the world,
and the number will keep
decreasing by half after each race.
(Dev) For instance, 32 in the first race.
(Dev) 16 in the second.
(Dev) And 8 in the third,
who will compete
in the final race.
(Siddharth cheers)
Now the rules.
(Dev) There are 16 flags on that truck.
(Dev) The players who grab the flag,
(Dev) will qualify for the next race.
(Dev) But --
the top speed of this truck
is 160 km/hr.
(Dev) And top speed of humans is 44 km/hr.
So...
go-karts.
(Dev) The target of the players is
to climb on these go-karts.
And the go-kart's target
is the players themselves.
(Dev) Because these go-karts
(Dev) are remote-controlled.
(crowd cheering)
(Dev) The players must climb aboard
these go-karts,
(Dev) and take manual control.
Once they have manual control,
they must climb atop the truck
as soon as possible.
Because each go-kart
has a built-in timer.
(Dev) Some 30, some 60
and some 90.
To each his own luck.
(foreign language)
(Dev) And remember,
there are only 16 flags
(Dev) and 32 players.
(Dev) So play well.
Because if you play,
you win.
And if you win,
you play again.
(all Cheering)
-Yes, got it.
-The race has begun.
(Male) Three, two, one.
(Male) Go!
(Go-kart engine sound)
Let's go.

the African and the Indian now.

Yes, Sid. Come on.
If this isn't madness, then what is?
Keep tracking number 10.
Jump.
He is crack.
You would have died
and gone to heaven. Come on.
Teamwork.
Interesting.
(male announcer) The timers on the go-karts
are running out.
(male announcer) Okay, that's one more go-kart
that has stopped.
(male announcer) Another go-kart shuts down.
(Go-kart crash)
I think he's on.
He's going to make it.
Yeah. We got a winner.
We got a winner.
Wow! That was unexpected.
(male announcer) Only three flags left
out of sixteen.
Come on.
Don't give the country a bad name.
(female announcer) Two flags
and seven contestants.
(female announcer) Let's see who makes it
to the finish.
(male announcer) Who grabs the last flag?
(male announcer) Number 10 or number 26!
Yeah!

but it's the Indian who has won our hearts.
(female announcer) Number 10,
India aka Crakk.
This guy Siddhart
is catching a lot of eyes.
It's time to meet him.
(footsteps)
You all made it here.
Congratulations.
You are anything but ordinary.
So don't expect an ordinary death.
(Dev) Tomorrow if someone dies like them,
then the amount you have won so far,
(Dev) will be given to your family.
(Dev) We won't mourn,
(Dev) for those who died today.
(Dev) Rather we will celebrate
(Dev) their life
(Dev) and their death.
We celebrated them
when they were alive.
And we will celebrate them in death.
So no grieving.
No feeling bad.
They are your heroes.
Seek their blessings.
And all the best for race 2.

How are you?
Oh, my God!
Welcome to the party
after the first race.
How have you been, sweetie?
Hey!
How have you been? Good?
Alright.
Sid. Oh, my God. You killed it.
Where were you?
I wanted to tell you that...
Leave it.
Sympathy for others and aloofness for me.
If you were one of them,
why did you show so much of attitude?
Hello.
Don't be so judgmental.
They are escorts.
I'm a social media influencer.
Different professions.
Then stay away.
If staying away from them
will change your perspective about me,
then you need to change

And out here, it's you.
What is the problem?
The problem is not you,
it's Dev.
I've heard he's bringing
a consignment,
which can be a threat to Poland.
I need your help to catch him.
Madam. I am a sportsman,
-not Agent Vinod.
-Siddharth.
You think I am requesting you.
(sirens blaring)
She's brought the cavalry.
You don't have a passport,
and you are in our country.
I can keep you in jail for life.
And when faced with trouble,
will Dev save you or himself?
What do I have to do?
You have to plant this chip on Dev.

I did nothing.

She cited your name.

And this...
She told me to stick this,

It's a tracking device.

(Dev) I know you are Nihal's brother.
(Dev) I didn't bring you here randomly.
Listen.
Inside Maidaan I am the law.
You tell me what you want.
I snatched the prey from
the python's mouth for the lion.
Now you are asking me what I want.
Good.
You understand the laws of the jungle.
I know, bro.
-The lion is the only king of the jungle.
-That's it.
Damn it!
Shit.
Hope I wasn't too gentle with you.
(helicopter sound)
(device beeping)
(sirens blaring)
-Freeze. Police!
-(gun firing)
Everybody let's go.
-Get back in. Get back in.
-Get the stuff out.
-Drop your weapons.
-Get the stuff out.
-Stop the van.
-Go. Go.
Everybody stop that van.
Shoot back.
(gun firing)
Shit!
-Shit!
-Cover me. Cover me.
Go. Get it up. Get it up.
Go, go, go.
Don't move.
Don't move.
(device beeping)
They say we've brought something
to their country
that we shouldn't have.
Did we, Mark?
(Male staff) Sir, Zack is arrested.
(Male staff) The consignment is safe,
but he has the password.
He doesn't have the password.
-He is the password.
-(sirens blaring)
(all cheering)
Race 2 is a go.
Taking you live through it all.
Ready to steal your hearts.
(male announcer) Fans are excited
and so are we.
(male announcer) It's a full house,
as you can see.
-Sea of players out there,
(male announcer) -Fans can't wait
(male announcer) -for the race to start.
-but Siddhu's on a roll.
Get forensics in.
I want every inch
of that chopper scanned.
How did we know about this?
I gave Siddharth two chips.
One he exposed,
and the other he planted on Zack.
He didn't betray us after all.
Today, Maidaan is in danger.
Thanks to Dev.
As long as I am alive,
there will be no threat to Maidaan.
(Male staff) Sir, if the police find out
what the consignment is,
(Male staff) it's all over.
We just got the forensic report
of the chopper.
You have to see this.
A-grade plutonium?
Then cancel today's race
for the sake of Maidaan.
Get off me.
Take it off.
A-grade plutonium radiation
was found in the chopper.
What's your plan?
I don't know.
And even if I did,
why the hell should I tell you?
I know how you freaking caught me.
It was that rascal, right?
That Indian.
He snitched.
We're going to kill him,
just like his brother!
His brother?
How did his brother die?
(cell phone vibrates)
What?
(alarm ringing)
Oh, my God! No, no, no.
(cell phone vibrates)
(Siddharth) Hey, Patricia madam.
Siddharth.
Yes, Siddharth.
(Siddharth) Saying yes is what got me
in trouble.
(Siddharth) Dev knows I led you to Zack.
(Siddharth) -Get me out of here right now.
-Hold on. Hold on. Be patient.
(Siddharth) You're telling me to be patient.
(Siddharth) My life is in danger, madam.
(Siddharth) There is a threat to my life.
Don't you get it?
(Siddharth) Get me out of here.
(Siddharth) -Do what you have to.
-Okay. Okay. Okay.
I'm sending you
a location on this number.
Be there.
My man will come and see you.
Done.
Let's play.
(music plays)
Dude, do you know how to get to India?
Go straight.
Sid. Sid.
You okay?
I'm making arrangements
for your departure.
Until then, you are safe.
Madam, no one here is safe.
You are not safe either.
Get out.
Honestly, get out of here.
-What?
-(gun firing)
What the...
-Go, go, go.
-Take cover.
(gun firing)
(car approaching)
(car comes to a halt and the door opens)
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Team Patricia, understand?
Go?
What the...
Team Maidaan.
Right?
Try to understand.
I am on your side.
Try to understand,
what I am saying.
-Put the detonator down,
-Easy, boy.
or I will shoot you.
Hold on. Listen.

Hello, Password. Shall we go?

Shit.
Guys, this whole place
is rigged to blow.
(gun firing)
Whoa.
Stop or I will blow this place up.
You aren't the only nutcases around here.
I live for my country.
-And I will die for it.
-Goodness gracious. What is she doing?
Nobody move.
Sid, what are you doing?
-Sid. Sid, what are you doing?
-What are you doing, madam?
I will blow it.
Guns down.
-You blue shirt, down.
-Siddharth.
Down.
Siddharth.
Not you guys, bro.
Loyalty. Maidaan. Team.
-Siddharth.
-Understand?
What Siddharth?
Enough with Siddharth.
You tell me to stick a chip
or go after Zack.
I am not some delivery boy, madam.
I am a sportsman.
And bro respects sportsmen.
He got me here through a ship.
Gave me five-star accommodation
in his castle.
This watch...
Even gave us this watch.
So we don't go missing.
He is not Dev.
He's God. God.
It's a little dramatic,
but I mean every word.
Nihal.
I am Siddharth.
Nihal what?
What Nihal?
He didn't die in the race.
Your "God" killed him.
Him.
What is she saying?
I killed his brother?
And gave him a chance
to be the champion in Maidaan?
-Interesting.
-Leave all that.
Yes or no?
Did you have a problem
with my brother?
Your brother died in a sport.
You liar! He is lying.
Turning a murder into an accident
and vice-versa,
who would know it better than them.
Zack told me that they killed
your brother.
Stop messing with my brain.
I am telling you I will press it.
And you.
Are you threatening me, boy?
Out with the truth
or I will take everyone with me.
I am really getting pissed off now.
I will count till five.
And if you don't hand me the detonator,
I will come over there
and press it myself. Got that?
One.
Save the other four,
for your funeral.
No, Siddharth.
-No, No.
-No.
(Dev) -Leave me. I will kill you.
-(explosion)
(Male staff) Cover him.
(Dev) I will kill you, you rat.
(Dev) Let me go.
(Male staff) Come on.
(Male staff) Move. Come on.
Take him.
-Let me go.
-Come on. Move.
Let me go.
Take him now. Go.
Are you okay?
I am if...
No, no.
Now I am not!
(Mark) Welcome to the final race
(Mark) of Maidaan.
(horn honking)
(Mark) In the final race,
(Mark) the contenders are...
(all cheering)
(Mark) Nihal.
(Mark) And Dev!
(music continues)
(Mark) It was quoted in 1980,
(Mark) that in the future,
(Mark) all kinds of travel
(Mark) will be done in the air.
(Mark) And not on the ground.
(Mark) And in Maidaan,
(Mark) that future has arrived.
(Mark) These bikes will be dropped
from an altitude of 40,000 feet.
(helicopter sound)
(Mark) Until the players don't get
on these bikes floating in the air,
(Mark) they cannot open their parachutes.
(Mark) The target of the race
(Mark) is to obtain the flag,
(Mark) which is placed in the middle
of the city.
(Mark) Whoever lifts the flag first,
(Mark) will be the winner of this race.
(Mark) So, guys,
let's play.

Bro.
Hey.
Can I have my phone back?
(indistinct chattering)
Lost you in Maidaan
(Music Continues)
Hand over your gun and badge.
No questions asked.
You are suspended.
You sided with the guys
who killed my brother
and you backstabbed me.
(Siddharth) You clicked my picture
and gave it to them.
I thought you are my girlfriend.
-I didn't know.
- (Siddharth) I was in love with you.
(Siddharth) But you showed your class.
Let me explain.
(banging the phone) Shut up.
-(device beeping)
-(Dev) Put the plutonium delivery on hold.
(Dev) The cops are watching us.
We cannot take a chance.
But good.
Tell the buyers we deliver
on the final day of the race.
(horn honking)
Stop it.
(brake sound)
What?
Run over me.
-Run over me.
-What is wrong with you?
I will call the police.
-Move out of here.
-You want to die?
-Run over me.
-Let's go from here.
What are you doing?
Stop fooling around, understood?
I will cause a riot here.
They separated us. These...
Hey!
What about our mom?
Siddhu.
You were phenomenal
when you were playing Maidaan.
Fantastic.
What if something happens to you
if you get in this mess?
Ever thought about that?
Did you think?
If you die,
then what about me?
Did you?
So you will make the same mistake
that I did.
Great.
But don't forget,
you are mom and dad's last hope.
Don't take that away from them.
This is my life.
That was your life, this is mine...
Quiet!
My life?
What my life?
Who gave you this life?
They did.
Did they do a favour?
Then you do them a favour.
Like you did?
By stopping me from entering Maidaan.
Tell me.
You stopped me, didn't you?
What were you trying to hide?
What were you trying to hide?
Tell me.
I asked everyone...who do I ask?
Where do I go?
Tell me. Why?
Who do I ask, bro?
Tell me what these guys did.
Brother!
(music continues)
Brother!
(all cheering)
JD on the rocks, please.
JD on the rocks.
I'll be right back.
Yeah.
(door closes)
Celebrating my destruction, aren't you?
Get out of here.
I've no interest in going to prison.
But I'm in this mess because of you.
Got that?
Tell me about my brother.
Because if he died in the game,
then he's accepted that
and so have I.
Not by treachery.
You betrayed me,
and I lost my job.
You gave Zack to Dev,
who has the password
for the plutonium.
Do you know what that is?
A chemical that is used
to make nuclear bombs.
I just want to know the truth
about my brother, understood.
Alright.
You want to know the truth
about your brother,
and I want the plutonium's location.
And only one man can tell us that.
Mark.
But for that, you will have
to go back to Maidaan.
(all cheering for DEV)
-Looks like the audience can't hold on.
-Did you see that?
-The crowd is going crazy for Dev.
-They are pumped.
Hundred bitcoins on number 10.
Number 15.
Put my bet on number 15.
(Crowd) Maidaan! Maidaan! Maidaan!
(Crowd) Maidaan! Maidaan! Maidaan!
(Crowd) Maidaan! Maidaan! Maidaan!
Welcome to the eliminations.
Only one step away
from the final race.
Today, the hunters are going
to be hunted.
(dogs barking)
(Dev) So, let's meet the most faithful animal
on the planet.
(Dev) Today, they will set
an example of disloyalty.
Two hundred hungry dogs
and the contestants on rollerblades.
(Dev) In this race,
you will all get a partner.
(Dev) A teammate
(Dev) who will not slow you down.
(Dev) They are all trained professionals.
(Dev) You will be tied to your partner,
(Dev) and the dogs were made to sniff
the clothes of your partner.
(Dev) So obviously, their target
will be your partner.
(Dev) The first way to lose
is if you break these shackles,
(Dev) and try to get rid of your partner.
Second, if you go beyond
these compound walls.
(beep)
(Dev) And third...
Any guesses?
If you become the dog's prey.
(dogs barking)
There is only one way
to win this race.
(device beeping)
(Dev) There are seven red flags
in this castle.
(Dev) When you obtain the flag,
a protective cage will envelop you.
(Dev) And you will qualify
for the third race.
(Dev) But remember, only qualify.
(Dev) To win this race,
you must find the white flag.
(Dev) The player who finds that
will be the winner of the race.
(Dev) And he will also get
the winning amount.
(Dev)And now, for some breaking news.
One of the sixteen contestants
is not a part of Maidaan.
And that is contestant number 10.
-Can you believe this? - What?
- What is this?
What could have happened?
I don't know, aunty.
(device beeping)
(device beeping)
Sir, more than half the bets
were on number 10 Siddharth.
Let the race begin.
(crowd cheering) -Siddhu!
-Siddhu!
(all cheering)
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu!
Siddhu! Siddhu!
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu!
Siddhu! Siddhu!
Here comes the hero.
Time for some action.
(male announcer) Number 10.
(female announcer) Brilliant.
The crowd's favourite number 10,
(female announcer) is back in the race.
(male announcer) Ready for the ride.
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu!
Siddhu! Siddhu!

Siddhu! Siddhu!
(all cheering)
I will play.
Nihal was a sportsman
and he knew,
the difference between victory
and defeat was only one second.
He knew that when he came here.
And he died while playing.
And listen to another thing
I came here to compete in Maidaan,
and not to get in any trouble.
I will win Maidaan.
Everything else can go to hell.
But,
do I want it?
That is the question.
When I win and you win the jackpot,
shall I give the answer after that?
The money I win from you,
I'll donate it for your
neighbourhood games.
You can go play there.
That is your class.
Not in Maidaan.
(Mark) Keeping in mind,
the wishes and interest of our fans
and spectators from around the world,
the founding members of Maidaan
have decided that,
Number 10 will be allowed to participate.
No way.
-He's back.
-Siddhu is back.
Yeah.
Number 10.
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu!
Siddhu! Siddhu!
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu!
Siddhu! Siddhu!
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu!
Siddhu! Siddhu!
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu!
Siddhu! Siddhu!
Okay.
They want you to play.
(Dev) But there is a problem.
(Dev) You need a partner in this game
which you don't have.
(Dev) And rules are rules!
For you, for me.
For everyone.
Everyone, right?
Is anyone willing
to team up with this traitor?
Me!
(Dev laughs)
How sweet!
One wants to play for her love
and the other for his brother.
I will play.
And win it.
(drums sound)
Restart the countdown.
(male announcer) The show is about to start
(dogs barking)
(male announcer) Five.
Before the race you spoke about class.
-You have proved your class.
-(male announcer) Four.
(dogs barking)
You judged me the second time
without knowing me.
-You're doing it again.
- (male announcer) Three.
(dogs barking)
(male announcer) Two.
You have time until the race ends.
Go hard or go home.
(male announcer) One.
(gate opens)
(dogs barking)
(dogs barking)
Oh, my God!
He's ripping his flesh apart.
(female announcer) First two contestants
(female announcer) They are dead meat, guys.
(dogs barking)
(male announcer) These dogs are really
going for it.
(male announcer) Number 10 is pulling the partner away
from the dogs.
(male announcer) Trust me.
(male announcer) It looks like more blood
than sweat.
(male announcer) That doesn't make sense.
(dogs barking)
Sid. Sid. Red flag.
I came here to dominate,
not to get eliminated.
Give a shout out
if you see the white one.
Look.
(dogs barking)
(female announcer) Okay, the Americans have chosen
safety with a red flag.
(female announcer)But remember,
the jackpot of this game is the white flag.
No!
After watching this,
I'll need a rabies injection.
(female announcer) Smart move by the Russian
saving her partner at the same time.
Run away, run away.
(beep)
(dogs barking)
I didn't know anything
about your brother's death.
You knew that snitching to Dev
could endanger my life.
Whoa.
(male announcer) And the Israeli takes
himself to safety.
We did it.
(male announcer) And the Australian takes their
qualifying red flag.
(male announcer) And three more have qualified.
(dogs barking)
(window glass breaks)
(male announcer)What a daring move by number 10.
Aka Crack.
Are you alright?
I am fine.
The flag. The flag.
-Quick. Let's go. Let's go.
-The flag.
There it is.
(female announcer) The Chinese, Arab and African
have obtained the flag
(female announcer) and made themselves safe.
(female announcer) Seven contestants have
qualified with the red flag,
(female announcer) and only the winning
white flag is left,
(female announcer) which will decide
this round's winner.
(Electric current)
(male announcer) Ohh...one more death.
The flag has been kept,
in the middle of an electric fence.
(dogs barking)
(male announcer) And from here on,
as you just saw,
(male announcer) only the contestants can enter
the electric fence, not the dogs.
If he wins today,
he will be the crowd's favourite.
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu!
Siddhu! Siddhu!
There is only one option,
but it can kill,
both of us.
By doing this,
can I win your trust?
Can't say about trust,
but we can win the race.
Let's do this.
(electric current)
(sighs)
(electric current)
(all cheering)
Here is the winner of race two.
Number 10, Siddharth Dixit.
-Yes. Yes. Yes.
-Hero.
Superman.
Yes. Yes.
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu!
Siddhu! Siddhu!
(Everybody singing) Happy birthday to you.
(Everybody singing) Happy birthday to you.
(Everybody singing) Happy birthday dear Dev.
(Everybody singing) Happy birthday to you.
(Everybody singing) Happy birthday to you.
(Everybody singing) Happy birthday to you.
(Everybody singing) Happy birthday dear Dev.
(Everybody singing) Happy birthday to you.
Oh father.
(indistinct chattering)
We'll have a slightly different
type of conversation today.
And Maidaan's fate,
will be decided by playing.
Because my intentions will not change.
Your favourite vodka is in four of these glasses.
And one,
has death for you or me.
So before we start drinking,
we'll tell each other the truth.
Because we're both tired
of hearing lies.
I picked you up from the streets,
but never loved you like a father.
I always loved Maidaan more than you.
The biggest mistake of my life was,
that I thought you'll,
take Maidaan to new heights.
I was doing that.
After I am gone,
there are four others,
who will control the reins
of Maidaan.
The horse is long gone,
and you're still holding the reins.
(Device beeping)
(Gunshot)
(camera clicks)
No, no.
(camera clicks)
(device beeping)
(Dev laughs)
Don't worry.
I won't kill you.
After all, you're my father.
Zack.
Take him.
Dude, open the door.
Boss's orders.
No one is allowed outside.
Politicians don't know about you
taking over Maidaan.
Where is Mark?
Elise is taking good care of him.

Hey, what did he say?
He said name of this place.
-Elise.
-Elise?

(Dev) This is not just a piece of land.
(Rap song)
It will be our world.
(Rap song)
Freedom for Maidaan.
Only once the plutonium
has been delivered to them.
(Rap song)
It will.
Hey, Sid. Come here.
I really want to,
but my focus is somewhere else.
Shut up.
Mark, the guy you're looking for,
is with some Elise.
And who is Elise?
My aunt.
I don't know.
Figure it out.
I got to go.
Can you do me another favour?
(Mark yells angrily)

Will you take me there?
It's Ali Baba's cave.
It's your job to get in.
(Rap song)
Do you like the Arab guy?
I love him.
Brother, I got you a date.
With the African?
Will you hit him for 25,000 dollars?
I will kill him for that much.
I really like him.

Fifteen minutes only.
Elise. Mark. Nihal.
Find anything.
-Can't get in.
-Hey,
that's why you need an Indian.
Come on.
CCTV camera.
Cut the line from the main server.
(grunting)
I will kill you.
(door opens)
Follow me.
Wow. Nice.
(Rap song)
(Rap song)
All the files on Nihal
have been deleted.
But,
Elise's files are here.
Where does Elise stay?
Inside building, full network.
Inside lift, no network.
Metal blocks signal.
Ex-army, trust me.
Elise is not a person,

The police got Mark out.
It was Patricia.
Get him back at any cost.
Alive or dead.
(Siddharth) I've heard Dev's lie.
(Siddharth) Now tell me your truth.
What did you do with my brother?
The final race that year,
was between Dev and Nihal.
He sabotaged Nihal's parachute's
release box.
I ignored this fact
even though I knew about it.
He was like a son.
(sighs)
Can I have your phone, please?
(phone touch sound)
This is for you.
(Male staff) Hey, Dev.
(Male staff) Want to say something?
(laughing)
(Male staff) And look who else is here.
(Male staff) Our very own Nihal.
(Male staff) The champ.
(Male staff) Want to send a message back home, buddy?
Fun fact.
When I was a kid,
my mom used to say,
"Don't jump from trees."
Or you will get hurt.
(Nihal laughs) Imagine if she sees me
jump from here,
she will faint.
And, father.
Don't worry.
Your son will return
after winning the race,
and show you the world.
And Siddhu, my love.
Brace yourself.
Next year,
your final race is against me.
Your older brother.
(Nihal) I showed your videos to everyone here.
(Nihal) They went crazy, Siddhu.
(Nihal) I told them
my brother is better than me.
(Nihal) They will invite you soon.
(Nihal) Okay, bro. Love you.
Take care.
(car engine sound)
(siren wails)
(gun loading)
So you work for him?
No.
I work for Dev.
Hey... no!
Stop. No.
And Zack,
works for me.
He always worked for me.
I will give you the location
and the password for the plutonium.
As promised.
Maidaan will always be about the game.
Nothing else.
I couldn't cherish a relationship.
But you must.
You are right.
You are a bad father,
and he's a bad son.
If I don't avenge Nihal's death,
I'll be a bad brother.

Take on him.
(all cheering)
Welcome to the final race day.
Today is a strange day.
A very strange day for Maidaan.
(church bell rings)
Such pain and betrayal,
Maidaan has never seen it before.
(truck door opens)
Hey.
Hey, what happened?
After all the hard work
and dedication,
can anyone abandon
their dreams?
(digging floor)
But let's get to the point.
Actually,
seven contestants,
have given up.
(gunshot)
(gun firing)
I wish they had spoken to me once.
(gun firing)
But it's sad.
Very...very sad.
Sid.
Open. Open.
But lucky for one.
So we do have a champ.
(Dev) Contestant number 10.
(Dev) Your favourite, Siddharth Dixit.
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu!
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu!
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu!
(all cheering)
Sid, are you okay?
Sid, what's wrong?
What?
(all cheering)
This was your dream.
There.
I made it come true.
Even I had a dream.
But every dream comes with a price,
and every shattered dream
comes with a price too.
Which those seven players had to pay.
Why did you spare my life?
If I had killed everyone,
who would have grieved?
I didn't spare you.
You will die every day,
thinking,
why I sought those poor people's help.
Whatever happened, Sid,
is on you.
Anyway,
today is your day.
I made your victory easy.
Go, enjoy your dream.
The champ.
(all cheering)
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu!
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu!
(crowd cheering) Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu!
I don't want your charity.
I don't want it.
Don't want it.
You came to watch the finals, didn't you?
(all cheering)
And finals you will get.
I swear.
(all cheering)
I am Siddharth Dixit,
number 10.
He says I am the champion.
So, Dev,
I challenge you
for the challenger race. Face me.
Come on.
(all cheering)
I love it.
I love it.
Of course, I accept.
(all cheering)
But this time,
the race will have only one rule.
The winner,
gets to live.
(all cheering)
(male announcer) Welcome to the challenger race.
(helicopter sound)
(male announcer) This race starts from the top of the mountains
(male announcer) and continues in
a 700-year-old cave.
(male announcer) a jungle
(male announcer) and then after passing
through this city,
(male announcer) it will end at
its destination.
(male announcer) But this race is not against
each other
(male announcer) It will be played against time
(male announcer) A time bomb will be tied
on the arms of both players.
(bomb ticking)
(male announcer) Which will blast twenty minutes
after the race starts.
(explosion)
(male announcer) The key to deactivate
this time bomb
(male announcer) will be obtained as soon as
the player puts the flag in the box.
(male announcer) Which is called,
the winning flag?
(male announcer) Three.
(male announcer) Two.
(male announcer) One.
(male announcer) Go!
(wind whooshing)
Unbelievable.
Dev and Siddharth
have their eyes on the flag.
(male announcer) And we are witnessing
the clash of the titans.
(male announcer) And Dev has the flag.
-The champion showing his champion move.
-Unbelievable. Dev has done it.
(male announcer) At the end of the race,
this flag will get the key
(male announcer) that can save one man's life.
(male announcer) So both the players have to safeguard
this flag till the end of the race.
The bomb's tied on them,
but I am on the edge.
