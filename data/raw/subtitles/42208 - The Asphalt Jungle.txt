-I don't know.
-What do you mean, you don't know?
He had a hat on.
Put on your hats.
WeII?
He was taII, you say. He had on
a brown suit and a wide-brim hat.

WeII, come on. Is that him?
No, it isn't him.
-Okay.
-That's aII.
Lieutenant Ditrich, commissioner
wants to see you in his office right away.
Sit down, Iieutenant.
Thank you, sir.
Thirty-nine thefts, 33 burgIaries,
1 8 robberies, seven assauIts...
...five moraIs offenses
in the past 30 days.
Quite a record,
even for the 4th Precinct.
We know the guy who's been puIIing
most of the stickups.
Name's Dix HandIey.
He was in the show-up this morning, but
our witness got coId feet and backed down.
-What can you do?
-Lock up the witness! Scare him worse!
It's your job, knowing what to do.
The onIy merchants
safe from harm in your precinct...
...are those who take wagers
on the horses.
I wanna know why those
parIors are stiII operating.
I cIose them down,
but they open up again.
You don't cIose them hard enough.
Rip out the phones, smash up the furniture!
PeopIe Iike to bet the horses,
and just because the Iaw says--
I don't want your opinion of the Iaw.
-Is that aII, sir?
-No, that's not aII.
-Where's Erwin Riedenschneider?
-I'm waiting to hear on that, sir.
You don't know where he is, do you?
No, but we ought to get
a word from our stooIies.
It was aII dumped in your Iap.
He Ieft prison yesterday at 1 2 noon, took
a train for this city, time of arrivaI, 3:1 7.
AII you had to do was stay with him
for 24 hours.
If he didn't register, Iock him up.
What happens?
He Ioses you five bIocks from the depot,
and a dangerous criminaI...
...is at Iarge in this city.
Two men on that detaiI
ought to get medaIs for dumbness.
They were assigned by you.
You shouId get one too.
Ditrich, I can do three things about you:
I can reduce you to patroIman,
send you down to Five Corners.
I can bring you up for triaI
on charges of incompetence.
Or I can give you one more chance
to make good on your responsibiIities.
I think that'II be
the greatest punishment of aII.
Thank you, sir.
There's the number you're Iooking for,
but it's dark.
You want me to wait?
I wouIdn't go parading around
this neighborhood with a suitcase.
Some of these young punks might cIip you
just to get a cIean shirt.
-Yeah?
-I want to see Cobby.
-Who are you?
-Just say Doc is here...
...and wouId Iike to see him.
Wait here.
You'd better be on the Iegit, paI.
WeII, where the deviI is he?
I'm a busy man.
What do you want?
I just got out today.
Oh, so that's it.
I'm tired of you guys
putting a bite on me.
-I'm no bank.
-I got a proposition for you.
AII you guys have.
-Maybe you didn't get who I was.
-I ain't never seen you before. What is it?
Maybe you've heard of me.
The Professor? Or Herr Doctor, maybe.
You mean, you are Riedenschneider?
WeII, why didn't you say so?
Come on in, Doc. Come on in.
Sit down, Doc. Sit down.
-Have a drink?
-Nothing to drink.
I got out of the habit behind the waIIs.
That's aII it is, a habit.
WeII, here's to the drink habit, the onIy one
I got that don't get me into troubIe.
WeII, Doc. What's on your mind?
I got a proposition. A big one.
-How big is big?
-Too big for you, Cobby.
Now, wait, Doc. I don't Iike to brag,
but I'm doing aII right.
Making book. I'm in the chips.
What kind of proposition is it?
A pIan for a caper.
And it's a good one.
I couId seII it for $ 1 00,000
on the open market...
...but that wouId be
throwing money away.
-I prefer to execute it myseIf and make--
-How much?
HaIf a miIIion doIIars.
Maybe even more.
I wiII have to do a IittIe checking,
as the pIan is some years oId...
...but not much checking. Not much.
I need roughIy 50,000 to operate.
Fifty thousand?
-No, no, no. I don't see.
-Of course.
I thought maybe Mr. Emmerich....
What do you know about Mr. Emmerich?
OnIy what I heard in the waIIs...
...that he has money to invest and that
the way to get to him is through you.
-If my information is not correct--
-Correct, sure. Sure. It's correct.
I just never thought of Mr. Emmerich
in connection with this kind of deaI.
Excuse me a minute.
I'II be right back.
-HeIIo, Dix. What do you want?
-I wanna make a bet.
-WeII?
-Your man says you got to okay it.
-What are you in for?
-2300 and some.
Okay. Your tab's good for 2500...
...but that's the Iimit. Either pick a winner
or pay me when you get that far.
Don't bone me!
-I'm not--
-Did I ever weIsh?
-Nobody said you did--
-You just boned me.
I'm not asking you any favors.
I'II go get you your 2300 right now.
Now, Dix. Now, Dix, Iisten.
WiII you have a drink? Come on.
Come on. Come back here.
Have a drink, wiII you?
Can you beat that?
-Where does he come off, bIowing a fuse?
-Who is he?
A smaIItime hooIigan,
who's crazy for horses.
My book beats him and beats him,
he keeps coming back for more.
Say, Doc...
...I forgot on account of that big tramp.
I spoke to Mr. Emmerich on the phone.
He's gonna meet us Iater tonight.
He's giving a party at his house in town
for a bunch of sweIIs...
...but he'II be at another address Iater on.
A man Iike Emmerich has got
more than one pIace to hang his hat.
Smart cat. Never does a Iick of work,
stays out aII night, sIeeps aII day.
What's a big, dirty cat
doing at an eating joint?
I run over one every time I get a chance.
PeopIe feeding cats,
and some kids haven't got enough to eat.
You gonna buy that magazine?
Why shouId I?
I seen aII the dames in it aIready.
Wanna make something of it?
-You're a IittIe off your beat.
-How do you mean, Humpty Dumpty?
I mean, you don't beIong around here.
You're just passing through,
onIy not fast enough.
If I ever see you running over a cat,
I'II kick your teeth out.
I'd take you apart if you were about
a foot taIIer and straightened up a IittIe.
Suppose you want your heater back.
WeII, you ain't gonna get it.
How about that?
-Quit kidding, Gus.
-I mean it.
Go on, get sore. Smack me down.
-You know I wouIdn't do that.
-Look, Dix...
...take my advice
and knock off for a whiIe.
The happiness boys are on a rampage.
Headquarters has given them the push.
-I can't afford to knock off.
-Oh, stop worrying. I'II stake you.
-Yeah? I need 2300.
-What?
-Something I just gotta take care of.
-Cobby, maybe?
WeII, Iet him sweat. It'II do him good.
Cobby can spare a few pounds.
You can't owe money
to a guy Iike him...
...a IittIe Ioudmouth who bones you
when he isn't even trying to.
I don't get you, Dix.
I just can't be in Cobby's debt
and keep my seIf-respect.
AII right.
I got a grand put away.
You can have that.
Maybe I can dig up 1 300 more.
-I guess it's aII right to owe me, huh?
-I guess.
Yeah. It's just my Iuck.
WeII, I'II get it tomorrow or bust a gut.
In the meantime, stay away
from the bouIevard, especiaIIy at night.
By the way, they knocked over
the CIub RegaI.
-Wasn't that where DoII worked?
-Yeah.
It's coming in bunches, it Iooks Iike.
Go home, Dix. Stay home.
Don't get your fIag at haIf-mast.
Remember, you stiII got oId Gus.
Thirteen hundred? You must be crazy.
For Dix? What do I care
for that hooIigan?
I'd Iike to heIp you out, Gus,
but I got mouths to feed...
...and rent to pay and aII that stuff.
Why don't you wise up,
you wise guy?
You're a Iow-down scum.
A Iow-down, dirty scum,
to taIk to me Iike that.
Look, Gus.
I guess I can make it, aII right.
-Yeah?
-Dix, it's me, Doll.
DoII?
Hi, honey.
Come on in.
-CIose the door.
-WeII, sure, Dix. Sure.
I'm awfuI sorry to bother you,
honey, but....
DoII, if you're gonna smoke,
you gotta Iearn to carry matches.
DoII, what are you crying about?
Nothing--
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Dix.
I don't know what I was thinking about,
bothering you at this time of the night.
I'II just run aIong.
Gus toId me the CIub RegaI
got knocked over.
Yeah. Can you imagine, raiding the RegaI?
The cops must have aII gone crazy.
So it's a cIip joint. So what?
And it wouId have to happen
on pay night.
-How about a drink?
-Hey, don't care if I do.
One of my eyeIashes is coming off.
Were you Iocked out of your room?
How'd you guess?
Here's how.
Dix, if it wouIdn't be too much troubIe,
couId I stay here a coupIe of days?
Just a day or two.
AII right. Stay if you want to,
but don't you go getting any ideas, DoII.
Everything is here, from the observed
routine of the personneI...
...to the aIarm system,
the type of Iocks on doors...
...the age and condition of the main safe
and so forth, so forth.
Take my word for it, Mr. Emmerich.
This is a ripe pIum ready to faII.
My friend, according to the boys,
aII takes are easy...
...but as a Iawyer, I make Iots of money
getting them out of jaiI.
PIease, Mr. Emmerich.
Perhaps you know my reputation.
I've engineered some very big things.
That's a fact, Mr. Emmerich.
Doc here is tops.
Am I to understand you gathered this
information before doing your Iast stretch?
That is correct.
I was ready to begin operations...
...and the cops grabbed me for
an oId caper I'd aImost forgotten about.
The AdeIphia Finance caper.
You took them for 1 60,000,
didn't you, Doc?
A hundred and fifty-eight.
You reaIIy beIieve
there's a miIIion in this thing?
-Maybe even more.
-You mean by that...
...that the take wiII be worth
haIf a miIIion to us in actuaI cash?
You know as weII as I do
that in no case wiII a fence...
-...give you more than 50 percent.
-That's right, sir.
-WeII, what are your main probIems?
-There are three.
Money to operate, personneI
and finaIIy, the disposing of the take.
No troubIe about the first, eh?
Wait a minute.
This remains to be seen.
The heIpers wiII be paid off
Iike housepainters.
They'II be toId nothing
about the size of the take.
Sometimes, men get greedy.
-WeII, how many heIpers do you need?
-OnIy three.
A box man.
Him, we pay most.
Maybe $25,000.
I got a guy for you. Louis CiaveIIi.
Best box man west of Chicago.
Expert mechanic.
Been in some very big capers.
From what I hear, he can open a safe
Iike the back of a watch. OnIy, he costs.
Then we need a topnotch driver,
in case of a rumbIe.
He shouId get 1 0,000.
And finaIIy, sad to say,
we need a hooIigan.
Most of these feIIas are drug addicts.
They're a no-good Iot.
VioIence is aII they know,
but they are, unfortunateIy, necessary.
For a more or Iess reIiabIe man,
I'd say 1 5,000.
WeII, that's 50,000 in aII.
How...?
How's this take to be handIed?
Get in touch with the best fences
in the Midwest...
...and deaI with whoever makes
the highest offer.
Maybe no one fence
can handIe the whoIe thing.
In that case, we deaI with two or three.
HaIf a miIIion, eh?
I....
I'm just thinking.
If I decide to go into this thing, I....
I, myseIf, I might handIe the--
You, a fence, Mr. Emmerich?
Oh, no, no, Cobby. Not exactIy.
But your proposition Iooks pretty good.
I'd Iike to see the most made of it.
Oh, I suppose a feIIa shouId stick
to his own trade...
...but I know some big men that might
not be averse to a deaI Iike this...
...if they're properIy approached.
HighIy respectabIe men, I might add.
So why don't you Iet me see what I can do
before you Iook for a fence.
A few days wouIdn't make
much difference to you, I don't suppose.
Might mean a Iot more money
for aII of us.
Good. There's just one thing.
I disIike to mention it, but...
-...I've just come from prison and....
-WeII, of course.
Cobby wiII be gIad to advance you
anything you need.
-See that you have a pIace to stay. Cobby?
-WeII, you bet your Iife.
And I got some fancy phone numbers
for you too, Doc.
What's it Iike, a man of your taste,
seven years behind the waIIs?
Not too bad.
It's a matter of temperament.
I cause no troubIe.
The prison authorities appreciate that.
They made me assistant Iibrarian.
I'm afraid I wouIdn't make
a modeI prisoner.
After this job, it's Mexico for me.
I'II Iive Iike a king.
Mexican girIs are very pretty.
I'II have nothing to do aII day Iong
but chase them in the sunshine.
-You've been very kind, sir.
-Good night. Good night.
-Mr. Emmerich.
-Cobby.
What's the big idea, standing there
staring at me, UncIe Lon?
Don't caII me ''UncIe Lon.''
I thought you Iiked it.
Maybe I did.
I don't anymore.
I had the market send over
some saIt mackereI for you.
I know how you Iove it for breakfast.
Some sweet kid.
It's Iate.
Why don't you go to bed.
Some sweet kid.
HeIIo, Bob Brannom?
This is Emmerich.
No, no. I didn't caII you
to get the right time.
Listen, I've got a job for you.
No, no. Nothing Iike that.
I've got over $ 1 00,000
standing out on my books.
Come to my office tomorrow, I'II give you
a Iist of the peopIe that owe me.
No, no, no.
Use the method caIIed for
in each particuIar case...
...and don't teII me anything about it.
AII I want is resuIts.
Easy, boy.
Easy, boy. Easy.
HeIIo. Who?
Oh, sure, Gus.
He's stiII asIeep.
What?
Yeah. Yeah, I'II teII him.
Honey. Honey, that was Gus.
He says you can come over.
He's got something for you.
Okay.
Coffee, honey? I made fresh.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, you sure were dreaming.
How do you know?
You were taIking in your sIeep.
What was I saying?
It was aII jumbIed up,
but I heard one word reaI pIain.
You caIIed it out severaI times.
''Corn cracker.''
What's that mean?
Corn cracker.
Corn Cracker was a coIt.
Yeah, it wouId be.
Yeah. He was a taII, bIack coIt.
Yeah, I remember what I was dreaming.
I was up on that coIt's back.
My father and my grandfather were there,
watching the fun.
That coIt was buckjumping
and pitching...
...and tried to scrape me off against
the fence, but I stayed with him.
Then I heard my granddaddy say, ''He's
a reaI HandIey, that boy. A reaI HandIey.''
And I feIt proud as you pIease.
Did that reaIIy happen, Dix,
when you were a kid?
No. The bIack coIt pitched me
into a fence on the first buck...
...and my oId man come over,
prodded me with his boot, said:
''Maybe that'II teach you not to brag
about how good you are on a horse.''
It's nice to hear you Iaugh.
You know something?
One of my ancestors imported the first
Irish thoroughbred into our county.
-Is that a fact?
-Sure.
Why, our farm was in the famiIy
for generations.
One hundred sixty acres,
30 in bIuegrass and the rest in crops.
Fine barn and seven brood mares.
-It sounds wonderfuI, Dix.
-It was.
And then everything happened at once.
My oId man died,
and we Iost our corn crop.
That bIack coIt I was teIIing you about,
he broke his Ieg and had to be shot.
That was a rotten year.
I'II never forget the day we Ieft.
Me and my brother swore we'd buy
Hickorywood Farm back someday.
Growing up in a pIace and then
having to Ieave must be awfuI.
I never had a proper home.
TweIve grand wouId have swung it,
and I aImost made it once.
I had more than $5000 in my pocket...
...and Pampoon was running
in the Suburban.
I figured he couIdn't Iose.
I put it aII on his nose.
He Iost by a nose.
Drink your coffee, honey,
before it gets coId.
The way I figure,
my Iuck's just gotta turn.
One of these days, I'II make a reaI kiIIing,
then I'm gonna head for home.
First thing I do, I take a bath in the creek
and get this city dirt off me.
-What's the matter?
-Nothing, Dix. Nothing.
-I say something wrong?
-No.
But, gee, this pIace is a mess.
It needs a good cIeaning.
How can you stand to Iive Iike this?
Count it.
-Count it.
-Don't have to pay the whoIe tab at once.
Go ahead and count it.
Why get sore?
There's no reason to get sore.
You boned me in front of a stranger,
made me Iook smaII.
I didn't mean it.
I shoot my mouth off.
Maybe I had a sIight Ioad on.
You know how it is.
No, I don't know how it is.
Look, Dix...
...I made a mistake.
Don't you ever make a mistake? Sure.
Sure. Here, have a drink.
Here you are.
There you are, Dix.
You gotta pIay the horses the smart way.
Save your money.
The next time there's a fix,
I'II Iet you know. It'II be money from home.
Excuse me.
Oh, it's the Doc. Come on in, Doc.
Meet a friend of mine, Dix HandIey.
This is Doc Riedenschneider.
You heard of him, I guess.
Yeah.
WeII, how'd you Iike the whiskey?
Made in your home state.
Where is that, sir?
Kentucky. Boone County, Kentucky.
-Best water in the U.S.A.
-Is that so?
Yes, the water makes
the whiskey fit to drink.
WeII...
...I gotta be going.
I'II see you around, maybe.
So Iong, Dix.
Big hick.
His money's aII right,
but I wish he wasn't so touchy.
Maybe it's a point of honor with him.
A gambIing debt.
Him, that hooIigan? Honor?
Don't make me Iaugh.
-He's a hooIigan?
-Yeah, but a smaIItimer.
He'II stick up cigar stores, gas stations.
And every cent goes to the ponies.
One way or another,
we aII work for our vice.
What do you say, Doc?
How was your date Iast night?
The young Iady drank too much,
but the evening wasn't a compIete Ioss.
-She taIked more than if she'd been sober.
-Yeah? What about?
-Your friend Mr. Emmerich.
-Emmerich? Now, Iook here, Doc--
There's haIf a miIIion at stake.
I've gotta know where I stand.
Emmerich must put up
before I can hire a crew.
For him, it's nothing. A dead cinch.
The information she gave me
is that he's broke.
Are you crazy?
I've seen him operate for 20 years.
He handIes onIy the biggest cases.
He's got two houses, four cars,
haIf a dozen servants--
-And one bIond.
-Doc, whose word you gonna take?
Mine or some dimwitted dame?
Yours, naturaIIy.
If he's broke,
I wanna be broke the same way.
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!
That guy you saw in my office,
he's just passing through.
Shut up. I didn't see anybody.
How couId I? I wasn't here.
Yeah, that's right. That's right.
-Look....
-Yeah?
I came to teII you
you'II have to stand stiII for a raid.
-You mean they'II hauI me downtown?
-It's a short ride.
I thought you were a friend of mine.
Right now I've got one friend: Ditrich.
And Ditrich's out on his ear
if he don't make a showing.
-Why me? Why pick on me?
-Because it's Iogic.
You're the biggest parIor in my precinct.
The citizens know it, the newspapers
know it and even I know it.
-And Mr. Commissioner knows I know it.
-I just hate to have it happen, that's aII.
-I'm as sorry as you are.
-Look, Iieutenant...
...I've aIways given you
pIenty of cooperation...
...but you're hitting me
at just the wrong time.
WeII, aII right.
CIose up tight.
Keep the pIace dark.
Don't answer any phones.
Thanks, Iieutenant.
Thanks.
That copper, he recognized me.
-How'd you know he was a copper?
-I can smeII one a bIock off.
Don't worry about Ditrich.
He's on my payroII.
Me and him, we're Iike that.
Experience taught me
never to trust a poIiceman.
Just when you think one's aII right,
he turns Iegit.
-A Mr. Brannom is here.
-Oh, yes, show him in.
Pardon me, sir.
Mrs. Emmerich is not feeIing weII.
Yes, weII...
-...send for Dr. Houseman.
-I aIready have, sir.
Good.
TeII her....
Say I'II be up to see her Iater.
WeII, what about my debtors?
How many of them came through?
-Not a one.
-What's that?
You want aII the excuses?
-I've got some beauts.
-It's as bad as that, eh?
Two or three may come through with a part.
-They promised.
-I don't want promises, I want cash.
Look, my friend, a private detective
can't go around threatening peopIe.
I'd Iose my Iicense. Ninety-eight percent
of them you're gonna have to sue.
There's no time for that.
I gotta have money.
I've gotta have it this minute.
What is it, girI troubIe?
Shut up, Brannom! That's not funny.
How's that?
Nobody teIIs me to shut up.
Sorry, Bob.
Bob, I--
I'm broke.
There. That's the pIain, simpIe fact.
I'm finished. I'm bankrupt.
-How couId you Iet AngeIa take you?
-It's not AngeIa.
It's everything. It's my whoIe way of Iife.
Every time I turn around, it costs thousands
of doIIars. 1 0,000 here, 1 0,000 there.
I gotta-- I gotta get out.
I gotta get out from under.
And the irony of it is
that I've got an opportunity...
-...and I can't take it.
-Tough.
Bob...
...I'm gonna hand you
the shock of a Iifetime.
Did you ever hear of
Doc Riedenschneider?
Sure. Behind the waIIs, isn't he?
No, he's out. He got out Iast week.
Cobby brought him to me.
He's got a pIan, beautifuIIy worked out...
...for the biggest caper ever to be puIIed
in the MiddIe West.
OnIy, he wants $50,000 backing.
Who wouId be taken?
BeIIetier's.
The rocks aIone wouId be worth,
conservativeIy speaking, haIf a miIIion.
-How much wouId you get out of it?
-A third of the take.
Brother. You're knocking me out.
What if I were to teII you that I've got
a pIan worked out to get it aII?
I couId teII them that I'd fence
the stuff myseIf, you see?
Promise them cash on deIivery.
Then...
...when the time comes,
I simpIy wouIdn't have the cash.
I'd teII them it'd take
a few days more to raise it.
I'm certain I couId get them to Ieave
the stuff with me whiIe we're waiting.
-Go on.
-WeII, then I'd disappear.
I'd take a pIane to another country,
to another Iife.
The goId and pIatinum I couId meIt up
and seII as buIIion, you see.
And the rocks, seII them one at a time.
There'd be no hurry.
They'd Iast a Iifetime.
How wrong can a guy be?
Here I was worrying about your nerves...
...and you were dreaming up
a doubIe-cross Iike this.
Yes.
But I can't do it,
because I haven't got $50,000.
I can teII you how to raise it.
You? How?
-What's in it for me?
-Fifty-fifty.
Okay.
But we may get ourseIves kiIIed,
my friend.
Yes, I know.
-WeII, how do we raise the money?
-SimpIe. Cobby.
-Cobby.
-BeIieve me.
He can dig it up without haIf-trying.
Yes.
But what do we teII him?
Why do I need money?
Leave it to me. Cobby wants to feeI big.
Here's his chance.
Advancing money
for the great AIonzo P. Emmerich.
He'II do it.
He'II sweat, but he'II do it.
What boxes have you opened?
CannonbaII, doubIe door,
even a few fire chests. AII of them.
-Can you open a vauIt with a time Iock?
-Sure.
-What do you use, Iock or seam?
-Seam.
Ever taken one?
-Remember the Shafter job?
-Yes, I heard about it behind the waIIs.
It was a good score.
-Who suppIies your soup?
-I thrash it myseIf.
-How are you as a pickIock?
-I can open anything in four minutes.
-He'II do.
-You're in.
Not so fast. What's the cut?
No cut. You get a fIat guarantee.
-I want 30,000.
-30,000? Now, Louis....
Twenty-five is what we figured.
-AII right, 1 5 down.
-Ten down.
Fifteen is satisfactory, I think.
There's your paymaster.
What are you sweating for?
Money makes me sweat, that's aII.
It's the way I am.
-Who are the others on this job, Doc?
-Haven't got them yet.
There's onIy one driver,
as far as I'm concerned. Gus Minissi.
Ask Cobby, he knows him.
-Gus, 1 00 percent.
-Get hoId of him.
-He'II take the heat and won't fIap his Iip.
-Get hoId of him.
Sure, Doc.
Any ideas about a hooIigan?
I know a very good heavy. I haven't
seen him in some time. Red Traynor.
-He's taking the cure.
-RuIe him out.
What about Timmons?
-Who's that?
-My doorman.
That busted-down wrestIer,
are you kidding?
He's got nothing upstairs
but soIid knuckIe.
I'm a stranger and do not know
as much as you gentIemen...
...but what about this southerner,
this Dix?
He impressed me as a very determined man
and far from stupid.
FrankIy, I don't Iike the guy,
but I never saw a hooIigan I did Iike.
They're Iike Ieft-handed pitchers.
They aII have a screw Ioose somewhere.
I suppose he's as good
as anybody, though.
Gus thinks he's tops,
and Gus is usuaIIy right.
I Iike him. I say we take him.
Suits me. You're the boss.
WeII, I better be getting home now.
Mrs. CiaveIIi's worried about the kid.
-What's the troubIe?
-He's got a coId again.
She takes him out first thing
in the morning. It's coId then.
She cIaims a baby's gotta taste fresh air.
Like I'm aIways teIIing her, ''If you want
fresh air, don't Iook for it in this town!''
Here.
He's 9 months oId there.
I must say, I envy you,
being a famiIy man.
Yeah.
WeII, aIways probIems, huh?
One good thing about Dix,
you can get him for nickeIs and dimes.
TeII me something, Cobby.
It's your money, isn't it?
Not Mr. Emmerich's.
-What difference does it make?
-None, reaIIy.
It's this way. Mr. Emmerich doesn't want
this transaction appearing in his books.
I'm not risking anything.
He's good for it in case of a runout.
Then you haven't got a worry.
No.
-Where are you going?
-I found a pIace.
A girIfriend's Ieaving town.
She Iet me have her apartment.
The rent's paid up
tiII the first of the month.
-When did this happen?
-This morning, before you woke up.
I bumped into her on the street.
Remember that taII brunette, used to do
the noveIty dances at the Bandwagon?
BIanche LaRue. It sure was nice of her.
I can't go Iiving off you forever, can I?
-I was gIad to heIp out.
-Yeah.
WeII, maybe I can do something
for you sometime.
You don't owe me a thing. Forget it.
WeII....
Goodbye.
-How are you fixed for dough?
-A coupIe of bucks. Enough.
Here, take this and--
No. No, thanks, Dix.
I'm aII through bothering.
Give us a kiss, huh?
DoII.
Yes, Dix?
Maybe I'II wanna get in touch with you.
Sure, my new address.
I'II be at 42 Merton Street.
42 Merton.
-HeIIo.
-Hello, Dix?
-Yeah.
-Dix, this is Cobby.
-Oh, hiya, Cobby.
-I got your number from Gus.
-Yeah.
-Look, Dix...
...do you want to get into something big?
I mean, real big.
If you do, be at Gus' tonight at 1 0:00.
Right.
Everything's here.
The soft spot's an oId steam tunneI.
ManhoIe's on the corner.
You drop into the manhoIe at 1 1 :45.
Dix wiII cover you.
You break through the waII.
It'II take about six minutes to get
into BeIIetier's from the furnace room.
Watch out for fIoor wires.
Make your way up the back stairs
and jump the aIarm system.
That wiII take another three minutes.
At exactIy 1 1 :54,
Dix and I wiII come to the back door.
You open it for us.
-I'II be waiting for you.
-Good.
Any questions?
-Everything sounds okay.
-Same here.
WeII, guess I better be getting home.
-How's the boy?
-Oh, he's okay.
Ran a temperature yesterday.
Pretty high too.
We caIIed the doctor, but temperatures
don't mean so much with kids.
He's back to normaI today.
-See you tomorrow night, 1 1 :30.
-Good night.
Have you got a minute, Dix?
Sure. What's on your mind?
My friend, what do you know
about this feIIow Emmerich?
You mean the big fixer?
I've heard his name, that's aII.
-I can taIk to you, I think.
-Sure.
Mr. Emmerich is taking the jeweIry
off our hands.
You sure are surprising me, Doc.
I don't exactIy trust Mr. Emmerich.
Just a feeIing. I may be wrong.
But it's up to us to coIIect, you and me.
Everything may go smooth,
but if it don't....
-If he's got it, we'II coIIect.
-Good.
We'II meet Mr. Emmerich after the caper,
deIiver the jeweIry and get our money.
The payment is to be immediate
and in cash.
After that, we pay off and scatter.
Don't worry, Doc. We'II coIIect.
Lon...
...is that you?
-Lon?
-Yes, May.
Come in, Lon.
-I've got a business appointment.
-Sit down a minute.
It's 1 1 :30. Isn't that
rather Iate for business?
-Lon.
-Yes, May?
I'm not feeIing weII.
You haven't been feeIing weII
for a Iong time.
At night, I get nervous.
And when I get nervous, I hate
to stay in this big house aII by myseIf.
Look here. May, you're not aIone.
There are three servants in the house.
-AII you have to--
-I know. Press a button.
WeII, what do you want me to do?
Sit down, Lon.
AII right.
Do I sit here and watch you
read a magazine?
-WouId that be so awfuI?
-Oh, now, Iook, May--
We couId pIay cards.
-Casino, Iike we used to.
-Some other night.
PIease, Lon, just one hand.
I couIdn't sIeep Iast night.
Then I got to thinking of the oId days...
...how we used to Iike to stay up
and pIay casino. Just the two of us.
Yes. I wish I couId stay, but I can't.
My dear, this is business.
I teII you what I'II do.
I'II Iook in Iater, and if you're stiII awake,
we'II have a IittIe game.
Take your keys, pIease. We're cIosing up.
Okay.
-AII set?
-Yeah.
Better be carefuI
how you handIe this stuff.
They'II pick you up in IittIe pieces.
What time have you got?
Good.
Good Iuck, Doc.
Did he give you the soup?
Here's the eIectric eye.
Soup.
It's gonna take a Iot to bIow this baby.
Here goes.
-What's that?
-Keep going.
Hey, Doc, aIarms are going off
aII over the bIock.
-The bIast must've shook the whoIe system.
-What do we do?
I wouId hate to Ieave now.
We're so cIose.
-I'm for finishing what we started.
-How about you, Louis?
-It's okay with me.
-WiII Gus hoId stiII?
Don't worry about Gus.
What's the matter?
The driII broke.
We shouId finish before 1 2:1 5,
before the watchman gets here.
The store cop? Let me worry about him.
-Hear that, Dix?
-Yeah.
-Coming this way?
-From the river. Don't sound good.
Take a Iook, see what's happening.
We gotta bIow, fast!
This is everything of reaI vaIue.
-Heavy, ain't she?
-PIenty.
This is the biggest one yet.
Wait tiII you see it in the papers.
Watchman. PuII open the door, Louis.
-Maybe he'II go away.
-Do what Dix says.
Now.
FoIIow me.
-Gus, take me home.
-Where did it get you?
Thigh. I can feeI it going up.
I think I got the sIug in my beIIy.
-I'II take you to a guy, used to be a doctor.
-No, no. Take me home, Gus!
AII right, Louis.
It's after 1 .
They shouId be here any minute.
UnIess there's been troubIe.
Where is AngeIa tonight?
She's at her sister's.
She says.
I'd go easy on that Iiquor if I were you.
HaIf-drunk, I got better wits
than most peopIe.
And more nerve.
You Iook worried, my friend.
Something bothering you?
Live and Iearn.
AII these years, I've been suffering
from an inferiority compIex.
I shouId've been in the money
years ago.
You big boys, what have you got?
Front. Nothing but front.
And when that sIips....
I do beIieve our guests are arriving.
WeII? Everything go aII right?
This is a friend of mine, Mr. Brannom.
He's been a great heIp to me
on this deaI.
FoIIow me. FoIIow me, gentIemen.
It's much more comfortabIe in here.
Say, I'II bet that thing is fuII
of Koh-i-noors and Grand MoguIs, eh?
CouId be.
Sit down, gentIemen. Sit down.
-Let me get you a drink.
-No, thanks.
Do you mind if we have a Iook?
You're entitIed to a Iook, naturaIIy.
-Convinced?
-Why, of course. Of course.
There never was any doubt in my mind.
You know, I know this feIIow's reputation.
Just a matter of curiosity, that's aII.
I'II bet the appraisaI is going to exceed
even your estimate--
Good. Good.
In that case, I'd just Iike to see
the coIor of the money.
GentIemen, I must admit
at this moment I....
I'm embarrassed.
-You mean you haven't got the money?
-Oh, I have it.
-That is, I have the assurance of it.
-You haven't got it.
No, I haven't got the currency
right here in my hands...
...but it's promised
by an unimpeachabIe source.
GentIemen, I'm afraid we were
a IittIe hasty. We moved too fast.
We moved on your word.
Wait a minute.
That's a Iarge sum of money, you know...
...considering present-day conditions...
...and considering the fact
that we had to have it in cash.
So I'm afraid a few days more
are needed to raise it.
A few days more may not seem Iike
a very Iong time to you, Mr. Emmerich.
But to me, carrying this around,
it wouId seem Iike years.
I understand.
I've got a soIution for that too.
That is, if you boys trust me.
And if you don't, weII, there's nothing
I can say except that I'm sorry.
Mr. Emmerich,
what are you trying to teII us?
About the jeweIs.
WouIdn't be safe for you
to carry that stuff around.
You mean, we Ieave them with you?
WeII, when the poIice start Iooking
for that stuff tomorrow morning...
...they're not IikeIy to caII me up.
They're not IikeIy to send detectives out
to search my house, you know.
You, on the other hand, Doc, you....
You're just out of prison.
They're certainIy gonna be Iooking
for the big-timers Iike yourseIf.
Some smart cop might even connect
this burgIary with your reIease.
WeII, there you are.
Of course, as I said, it's up to you.
Keep in touch with me through Cobby.
You did a great job, Emmerich,
but it's not working.
-Bob!
-Back away and keep out of this, Emmerich.
Now, you, farmer, get your hands up.
And you, Fritz...
...throw the bag on the fIoor.
Over here by my feet.
Be carefuI how you throw it.
I got a pistoI expert medaI.
-What do you say, Dix?
-He's got no say.
He makes a crooked move,
he'II never pitch another forkfuI of manure.
He's got us, Doc. Toss him the bag.
You're not as dumb as you Iook.
Are you a man or what?
Trying to gyp and doubIe-cross me
with no guts for it.
What's inside of you?
What's keeping you aIive?
Why don't you kiII me?
-What's stopping you?
-Okay, mister--
Dix, Iisten to me. Don't kiII him.
It's too easy an out for him.
Sit down, sir.
Whatever possessed you
to puII such a stunt?
I was broke, facing bankruptcy.
He's a witness.
He saw me knock off that guy.
-You think he wouIdn't hoIIer?
-He's in no position to taIk.
What did you and your man on the fIoor
intend to do with the jeweIs?
Leave town.
SeII them off a IittIe at a time.
No good. The poIice wouId have been
on you after the first saIe.
You can't go peddIing stuff Iike this around
when the heat's on.
Let's not fooI around here any Ionger.
Be patient, Dix.
Mr. Emmerich got us into this hoIe,
and he's going to get us out.
I didn't save your Iife
because I'm a Iover of humanity.
We're in troubIe with
this satcheI fuII of jeweIs.
As things stand, it's just so much junk.
-There's nothing I can do.
-Yes, there is, Mr. Emmerich.
You can go to the insurance company.
-Insurance company?
-They'II Iisten to reason.
This is a very bad joIt for them.
It's possibIe they'II be wiIIing to buy
the jeweIs back, no questions asked...
...for as high as 25 percent
of what they're worth.
Doc, Iet's bIow.
I'II start on it tomorrow.
Get busy, Emmerich.
And remember, you might have been
Iying here dead with your friend.
ShaII I get in touch with you
through Cobby?
No. I'II get in touch with you.
Come on, Dix.
I advise you to cIean up after your friend.
-Don't give him any water.
-He asked for it.
-I said, don't give him any water.
-Let go.
You wanna kiII him?
Maybe he's hurt in the stomach.
Where's the doctor?
Why doesn't he come?
You said 1 0 minutes. It's haIf an hour.
Louis wiII die.
Why can't I take him to the hospitaI?
They wheeI him into an operating room,
you'II never see him again.
Take it easy, Maria.
Louis is gonna be aII right.
The doctor wiII be here,
fix him up good as new.
You and Louis are gonna have
six more kids.
AII as fat as pigs, big bIack eyes,
Iots of hair.
Just Iike Louis, eh, Maria?
Stay away from the baby!
TeII me the truth.
How did it happen?
-I toId you. A fight.
-Louis don't fight. You know that.
Why is it aIways you?
Whenever Louis gets into troubIe,
you're around.
You dirty crippIe! You crooked-back!
-You have the eviI eye!
-Shut your mouth, Maria!
I don't Iet anybody say that to me.
I'm sorry, Gus...
...but I gotta bIame somebody.
What I carry on my back,
I was born with it.
I didn't grow it myseIf.
PIease forgive me, Gus. I didn't mean it.
-Listen to that.
-Yeah. Must be a fire.
It's not in this neighborhood, though.
SomepIace eIse.
Oh, Gus. I pray to God
that doctor get here quick.
He'II be here any minute, Maria.
Sounds Iike a souI in heII.
Dix, why don't you get in touch with Gus
and Iet him take you to the doctor.
-Don't be fooIish.
-I don't Iike doctors.
I'm getting aIong aII right.
That buIIet just ripped through my side
and went on about its business.
-Good thing I jumped.
-How can things go so wrong?
How is it possibIe?
One man kiIIed,
two others pIugged.
I'm out 30 grand. We got a Ioad
of rocks we can't even peddIe.
Quit crying and get me some bourbon.
I must be awfuI stupid.
Here I am with
a good business...
...money roIIing in...
...I gotta get mixed up
in a thing Iike this.
I ought to have
my head examined.
Yeah, heIIo, heIIo.
Yeah, this is Cobby.
What?
It's Gus. Dragnet's out,
and they're combing the district.
He wants to taIk to you.
You, Dix.
Gus? Dix.
Yeah. Listen carefuI.
Cops are knocking over joints aIong
the bouIevard, meat wagons and aII.
Now, Iook, I aIready caIIed a guy,
Eddie Donato.
Donato's got a grocery down by the river.
1 1 6 Front Street. You got that?
Yeah. Thanks, Gus. How's Louis?
Louis is not so good. He got a sIug
in his beIIy. Doc's doing aII he can.
Here they are now,
the happiness boys.
HeIIo. How are you?
Looks Iike I'm in for a working-over.
Look. Go down to Eddie's
by way of the oId car barn.
It's deserted at night.
You get beyond that, you're okay.
Cops never bother Eddie's neighborhood.
So Iong, Dix. BIow now.
AII right, aII right, aII right.
What? PIease taIk a IittIe Iouder.
This is Eddie Donato.
Oh, sure, sure.
I'II get Doc for you.
Hey, dottore, I got your man.
HeIIo.
Yes.
Fine, fine.
Good.
That wiII be satisfactory.
-Cobby?
-Yes.
Emmerich came through.
The insurance peopIe say okay.
Of course, we have to wait
tiII the banks open Monday morning.
But it's 250,000, which is not bad.
-What's the matter?
-As a Iawyer, you may be very briIIiant.
But as a casino pIayer,
you have a Iot to Iearn.
-You don't mind if I smoke, do you?
-Of course not, Lon.
Lon, how couId you make
a pIay Iike that?
You won't make
a singIe point this hand.
-Come in.
-Two gentIemen to see you, sir.
They are from the poIice department.
What on earth couId they want, Lon?
WeII, something to do
with a case, I suppose.
-Excuse me?
-Oh, bother. We were having so much fun.
-Hurry back.
-Sure.
-Yes?
-Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Emmerich.
I'm Andrews.
This is Officer Janocek.
-How do you do?
-How are you?
WeII, what can I do for you?
Do you know a man
named Robert Brannom?
Brannom. Yes, of course.
What is it?
Something the matter?
There sure is, Mr. Emmerich.
His body was puIIed
out of the river this morning.
-Great heavens.
-But it was no drowning.
He had a hoIe through his pump.
He'd been shot.
WiII you step in here for a minute?
WeII, I must say, this is....
It's quite a shock.
Bob Brannom, eh?
Murdered, you say?
Great heavens.
We found a Iist of names in his pocket
written on your business stationery.
-Who are these peopIe, do you know?
-Oh, that's a Iist of my debtors.
Brannom was working for me.
He was trying to coIIect oId debts...
...without much success, I must say.
Was he giving the treatment
to anybody on this Iist?
CertainIy not.
Then you don't think there's any connection
between this work for you and his death?
-None whatever.
-When did you see him Iast?
WeII, now, Iast Wednesday evening,
in this room.
Yes. We went over that Iist together.
The coroner says he was pIugged
at 1 :00 or 2:00 this morning.
Not much after the BeIIetier job was puIIed.
We figured there
might be a connection.
One of the heist guys was shot,
we know that.
There was bIood on the fIoor.
Maybe it was Brannom's.
He couId've died in the car,
they dropped him in the river.
Oh, no, no. Bob Brannom's a good deaI
of a roughneck, but he's no criminaI.
And if I'm any judge, BeIIetier's was
the work of bigtime professionaIs.
Oh, no, no, gentIemen.
Bob Brannom mixed up in any burgIary...
...why, that's inconceivabIe.
I see.
Oh, one more thing, Mr. Emmerich.
Just for the records, of course.
CouId you give us an account
of your whereabouts Iast night?
Yes, I couId.
Why? Is it necessary?
I'm afraid so, Mr. Emmerich.
WeII, boys, a man of my years
hates to make an admission Iike this...
...but a Miss PhinIay is Iiving
in my cottage on the river.
And Iast night, I went to visit her
at about 1 1 :30, I think it was.
Stayed rather Iate.
Oh, she'II verify this, of course.
Oh, but boys...
...use a IittIe discretion, eh?
UnIess, of course, it serves
some usefuI purpose.
I understand, Mr. Emmerich,
and thank you very much for your heIp.
Oh, not at aII. Thank you.
And say, if I can be any further heIp,
you just caII on me.
-Good day.
-Good day.
-HeIIo, AngeIa?
-Yes.
-This is Lon.
-Why haven't you called me?
Listen, baby,
you may have a visit from the poIice.
-Is it your wife?
-No, no. It's nothing Iike that.
They'II probabIy ask you
some questions about Iast night.
Now, Iisten, baby.
I want you to teII them
that I was there with you...
...from 1 1 :30 untiI 3 in the morning.
-That's most of the night.
-Most of the night, that's right.
-Now, is that cIear?
-Sure, it's clear.
Yes. Oh, no, no. Just poIitics, baby.
-Good oId dirty poIitics.
-All right. Call me right away.
-Yes, I'II caII you Iater.
-Don't forget.
Yes.
Can we go on pIaying?
CertainIy. Why not?
Why, Lon, you're as paIe as a ghost.
What's the matter?
WeII, I just had some bad news.
A man who works for me got kiIIed.
Oh, Lon, how awfuI.
Was it an accident?
No.
No. It was...
...an intentionaI kiIIing.
-Do they know who did it?
-No.
Oh, Lon, when I think of aII those
awfuI peopIe you come in contact with...
...downright criminaIs,
I get scared.
Oh, there's nothing's
so different about them.
After aII, crime is onIy...
...a Ieft-handed form
of human endeavor.
-Ever been in Mexico City, Dix?
-Nope.
It's 8000 feet up.
The air is very pure.
Many first-cIass cIubs,
restaurants, a horse track...
...and girIs.
BeautifuI young girIs.
How wouId you Iike to go there,
aII expenses paid?
Sorry, Doc, not interested.
I'm heading home.
Listen, Dix.
You can aIways go home.
And when you do, it's nothing.
BeIieve me. I've done it. Nothing.
My mind's made up.
It's me.
Look, my friends.
My friends...
...I am a respectabIe man.
For Gus, I do a favor, aII right?
With this picture in the paper--
You mean you want us to bIow?
Is that right, Eddie? Okay.
The sooner we get out of here,
the better.
Eddie's getting to the pIace where
he'd taIk with encouragement.
Oh, no. I no taIk.
Gus cut my beIIy open.
I'm sorry, my friends,
to bring you this bad news.
-I go now, pIease.
-Sit down, Donato.
You're not going anypIace tiII I say so.
Stay put, Eddie.
Nobody's gonna hurt you, so Iong as you
sit stiII and keep your mouth shut.
The way I figure, the insurance guys sicced
the cops on that phony, and he spiIIed.
You never shouId've stopped me
from bIasting him.
No, Dix. He hasn't spiIIed...
-...or they wouIdn't be Iooking for just me.
-Then how come?
Because there's onIy three or four men
who can manage a job Iike this.
Somebody in the department with
a few brains has decided I'm the guy.
I've been haIf-expecting it.
It doesn't worry me much.
We'II get our money tomorrow, you bet.
I hope so.
-Where are we going, Dix?
-I know a pIace.
Eddie, if you're a smart boy,
you'II forget you ever seen us.
-I wanna see the commissioner.
-State your business.
I'm a citizen. I can see the
commissioner if I want to, can't I?
-Is it about Riedenschneider?
-CouId be.
He sure gets around, that guy.
About 5000 peopIe have seen him
in the Iast 24 hours.
If you get in that Iine and wait your turn,
you can teII your story.
-I won't teII anybody but the commissioner.
-Okay. Sit down and wait, buddy.
-But it may be some time.
-Okay.
I'd Iike to see the commissioner.
Where do you think you're going?
-We're on our way home.
-Yeah?
-Where do you Iive?
-South on Camden.
You got no business here.
This is city property. There are signs.
-Everybody uses it.
-You're teIIing me.
Even hoodIums have been
bringing girIs here.
-Is that a fact?
-Yeah.
It's cost one of our boys his job,
on account of the beefs.
If I were you, I'd stay out of here.
You understand?
Okay, officer.
Hey, wait a minute.
You, with the bag.
Come here.
Dix!
Oh, Dix, honey.
You'II have to excuse me.
I took a coupIe of sIeeping piIIs,
and I guess I'm stiII kind of groggy.
I haven't been abIe
to sIeep much IateIy, Dix...
...worrying about you
and everything.
I was up at your pIace.
They toId me the cops
were after you.
Get me some coId water
and some toweIs and stop yapping.
Sure, Dix. Sure.
-Get a move on.
-Oh, you bet.
Put in hours and hours of pIanning.
Figure everything down
to the Iast detaiI. Then what?
BurgIar aIarms start going off
aII over the pIace for no sensibIe reason.
A gun fires of its own accord,
and a man is shot.
A broken-down oId harness buII,
no good for anything but chasing kids...
...has to trip over us.
BIind accident.
What can you do against bIind accident?
One thing I ought to have
figured was Emmerich.
I know why I didn't.
I'm not kidding myseIf.
It was the extra dough he promised.
I got hungry.
Greed made me bIind.
Hey, Dix. Dix, isn't he the one
with the reward on him?
Mind your own business.
She confirmed what Emmerich said,
that he was with her from 1 1 :30 tiII 3.
-How did she impress you?
-Very much.
-She's some babe.
-That's not what I mean.
Was her manner straightforward?
Oh, I guess she was
teIIing the truth, aII right.
Married 20 years,
consorting with a woman...
...young enough to be his granddaughter.
It's disgusting.
But nothing about Emmerich
wouId surprise me.
Educated man who uses brains
to circumvent the Iaw.
Worst type of human being.
No excuse for him.
-Excuse me, commissioner.
-WeII?
There's a taxi driver
been waiting outside.
-Says he's got some important information.
-Concerning what?
I tried to find out, but he
wouIdn't taIk to anyone but you.
He's been waiting two hours.
-AII right, send him in.
-Yes, sir.
-What's your name?
-CharIes Wright.
Hackie number 1 4803.
Green Stripe Company.
-What's this information you've got?
-That doctor everybody's Iooking for.
-I think I had him for a fare.
-You drove him somepIace?
WeII, now, I'm pretty sure it was him I
picked up at the station a week ago Friday.
Friday the 1 6th?
Where did you take him?
To a number on Camden West.
I remember I asked him
if he wanted me to wait.
I know a feIIa that got
roIIed once on Camden West.
He didn't have nothing,
so they stoIe his pants.
Where did you take him?
What number?
47 1 7. Kind of a storeroom.
It was dark.
-What's that number again?
-47 1 7.
Used to be a bookie joint, commissioner.
Get hoId of Lieutenant Ditrich.
Yeah, that's him.
At first I thought I was making
a fooI of myseIf by coming down here.
But that's him, aII right.
You may be in for a reward.
I hope so.
Lieutenant Ditrich on one.
-Where are you, Ditrich?
-I'm at 4th Street and 6th.
AII right. Now, get a search warrant
and go to 47 1 7 Camden West.
-Riedenschneider was seen there.
-That's 47 1 7?
Yeah.
Stake your men out before
you go in. Get a move on.
Some news just came in.
A patroIman was on duty at the car barn.
He ran into two men and was sIugged.
They got away, but he identified one
as Riedenschneider.
Good. Great.
We'II bIock off the whoIe area.
No sirens. We'II make it a sneak.
How about the patroIman? BadIy hurt?
A head wound and he's punchy.
The doctor doesn't
think he's got a fracture.
WeII, son, Iooks Iike maybe
we're getting somewhere at Iast.
Look, Iieutenant,
what wouId I know about BeIIetier's?
I wouIdn't mix into a robbery.
You know that.
-WouIdn't you?
-No, of course not!
You saw Riedenschneider here, sure.
-That don't say--
-You're nuts.
Never seen anybody here.
How couId I?
I never been here before this.
WeII, that being the case...
...what's to connect me
with the BeIIetier job?
Somebody saw him here.
I don't know who.
Maybe you got a fink around.
Look. You're sure you
won't have one, Iieutenant?
No, thanks.
I never drink whiIe on duty.
It's against reguIations.
Look, I got nothing to hide.
Riedenschneider hoIed up here.
He was broke.
I Iet him use one of the rooms
for a coupIe days.
I got tired of having him around.
I gave him a few bucks to get rid of him.
-Where did he go?
-I don't know.
I don't know.
Look, Cobby, do you figure me
for a paI, or don't you?
I sure do, Iieutenant.
Then take my advice and turn state's.
We'II make a deaI
with the commissioner.
-You won't get more than a year or two.
-Look, I'm cIean.
I don't know where he went.
That's the truth.
They won't beIieve
you at headquarters.
When you teII them that,
they'd work you over.
You ain't the type that can take it.
You'd spiII your guts in a haIf-hour.
Give me a break.
You came to make a pinch, sure.
But I'm not here.
I had to go to Chi on business.
You're right here, Cobby.
I've aIways treated you right, Iieutenant.
Let me duck out.
-You can get away with it.
-No, I couIdn't.
The commissioner's mad.
He's out for bIood.
And it's not going to be mine.
You're not gonna stop me!
You're gonna Iet me go!
You're gonna do that!
If you don't--
Yeah, I know.
You'II be a Grade A pigeon.
That's right. I'II teII them
you saw Riedenschneider here...
...and didn't roust him. Why?
You'd have to expIain
what you were doing here.
I'II teII them about the juice
you've been getting.
The onIy thing you're doing
is making me sore.
Once I start singing, I won't stop!
They'II jug you right aIongside of me!
That's where you're wrong.
Even if they beIieve you,
it won't go too hard with me.
Because I'II be the guy that cracked
the biggest case ever puIIed in the country.
-You're gonna get hurt, Cobby.
-What, have you gone crazy?
Stand up!
I toId you you couIdn't take it, Cobby.
Here.
They'II caII me a fink.
That's my boy.
So since I'm gonna be
busy with a Iot of cases...
-...you might Iike to take a trip.
-Where to?
I don't know. The coast, FIorida.
Anywhere you Iike.
CouId I, UncIe Lon?
Anywhere? No fooIing?
Yes. I think a change of scenery
might be good for you.
Wait. You wait right here.
I've got the most terrific idea.
Oh, Cuba. There, that's not a bad idea.
Imagine me on this beach here
in my green bathing suit.
I aImost bought a white one,
but it wasn't extreme enough.
If I reaIIy went in for the extreme extreme,
I wouId have bought a French one.
Run for your Iives, girIs.
The fIeet's in.
Oh, UncIe Lon, am I excited!
Look, UncIe Lon. Isn't it romantic?
ReaI paIms and ocean and everything!
Who can that be this time of night?
See who it is, UncIe Lon.
Why are they pounding so?
I'm scared, UncIe Lon.
WeII, young man,
you've got an iron fist--
Oh, heIIo, Hardy. Come in.
WeII, there's a fire in here.
Come on in. You Iook coId.
I'm here to arrest you, Emmerich.
May I ask what for?
CompIicity in robbery and in murder.
If I were you, Hardy,
I'd think up a few more charges.
You might make
one of them stand up...
...if you get an imbeciIe jury
and the right judge.
-Get the young Iady.
-Yes, sir.
It may interest you to know that your
friend Cobb has signed a confession.
Want to take a Iook at it? Here.
Okay, miss. It's a shame to bust
this door in, but here goes.
Haven't you bothered me enough,
you big banana-head?
Just try breaking my door,
and Mr. Emmerich wiII throw you out.
Afraid not, miss.
He's got troubIes enough.
As a matter of fact, he's a dead duck.
Hurry up, Andrews.
Bring the young Iady in here.
Do I have to taIk to him?
CouIdn't I just taIk to you?
Come on, baby.
Get it over with.
And be smart.
TeII the commissioner the truth.
That's the onIy thing to do.
Come on.
Sit down.
Andrews, repeat the statement Miss PhinIay
made before you yesterday afternoon.
She said Mr. Emmerich was here with her
from 1 1 :30 p.m. to 3 a.m. Iast Friday night.
Is that the statement you made?
-Yes, sir.
-Was it the truth?
You better think before you answer...
-...unIess you wanna go to jaiI.
-JaiI?
For setting up a faIse aIibi to keep
another from being punished for a crime.
-Mr. Emmerich wouIdn't commit a crime.
-He wouId and did.
TeII him the truth.
-UncIe Lon.
-It's the onIy thing to do...
...unIess you want to be indicted
for obstructing justice.
What I said yesterday was....
WeII, it wasn't exactIy--
I mean--
-It wasn't reaIIy the--
-Was it the truth?
No, sir.
-You weren't with Emmerich, were you?
-No, sir.
-You were somepIace eIse, not with him.
-Yes, sir.
He toId you what to say,
made you Iearn it by heart.
Answer me!
I mean, yes, sir!
I mean, I Iearned it by heart!
Get a new statement from her.
Have her sign it.
This time, young Iady,
I want the whoIe truth.
Over here, miss.
I'm sorry, UncIe Lon.
I tried.
You did pretty weII, considering.
What about my trip, UncIe Lon?
Is it stiII on?
Don't worry, baby.
You'II have pIenty of trips.
Seems to be aII wrapped up, Emmerich.
Oh, here.
Say, I'd Iike to teIephone my wife,
if you don't mind.
Getting Iate. She might be worried.
HeIp yourseIf. But don't try to run.
You won't get very far.
Emmerich!
-Stop! Stop!
-Come on!
-You wait and see--
-Break Ioose!
You dirty fink. You're gonna
wind up where you beIong.
You're gonna wind up in the morgue!
You wait and see, you dirty fink!
Home of the pigeons!
Fink! Fink!
Fire escape.
We're Iooking for Louis CiaveIIi.
I'd consider it a great favor
if you didn't insist on going in.
Mrs. CiaveIIi is, weII,
I don't have to teII you.
If the father says it's okay,
WiIIiams, it's okay.
-CaII the commissioner's office.
-The commissioner knows me.
-Mention my name. Sortino.
-Thank you, Father.
''Emmerich was a graduate of
the Iaw coIIege of State University...
...and had practiced here
for over 25 years.''
What fooIishness. UnbeIievabIe.
He wouIdn't have gotten
more than two years.
He even doubIe-crossed himseIf.
How's your head, Doc?
Good as it ever was,
which isn't saying much.
You know, getting out of town's
not gonna be a cinch for you.
Oh, I'II get out, aII right.
I'II take a taxi to the edge of town,
then have him drive me as far as CIeveIand.
Sure you wouIdn't come
aIong with me, Dix?
Keep it.
No, thank you.
If you won't come,
wiII you finance me?
I haven't got but 4 or 5 doIIars.
Sure, I'II finance you.
How much you need?
I can get aIong on $ 1 000,
thanks very much.
And you can have
the rest of these stones.
That's $50,000 worth.
What wouId I do? Can you see me
waIking into a hockshop with that stuff?
First they'd think they were phony,
then they'd yeII for the riot squad.
No. You can have the thousand,
but no rocks for me.
WeII, thank you, Dix.
TeII me where to write you. At Ieast I can
send you the 5 grand you got coming.
-What wiII your address be in Kentucky?
-Forget it.
Maybe I'II see you around.
WeII...
-...goodbye, then.
-Goodbye, Doc.
Hey, wait. You haven't got a heater.
I'd Iet you have mine,
but you got a gun, DoII?
No, Dix. I used to have one around,
but I guess somebody stoIe it.
I don't want a gun.
I haven't carried a gun since my 20s.
You carry a gun, you shoot a poIiceman.
Bad rap, hard to beat.
You don't carry a gun,
you give up and they hoId one on you.
AII right, Doc. You know best.
How about a cup of coffee, honey?
That squarehead.
He's a funny IittIe guy.
I don't get him at aII.
Maybe it's because he's a foreigner.
They just don't think Iike us.
I gotta get out of town too,
before morning.
Anyway, he's got pIenty of guts.
-How about a cup of coffee, honey?
-Make it or shut up about it.
-It's that wound.
-Bright girI.
Dix, it's starting to bIeed again.
I know, aspirin.
Pickering Avenue and Center Street.
You know where that is?
-The other side of town.
-How far is that?
-I can make it in an hour.
-Okay. I got reIatives Iiving there.
I'm between trains.
I got nothing eIse to do.
I know how it is.
I got reIatives myseIf, on both sides.
AIways writing me Ietters for money.
I haven't spoken German for a Iong time.
-You have a München accent.
-I was born there.
You know what they say,
''Home is where the money is.''
-Yeah.
-Franz?
-WouId you drive me to CIeveIand?
-It's a Iong way, my friend.
But it wouId stiII be quicker
than to take the train.
-What about your reIatives?
-Forget them.
WeII, I don't know.
CIeveIand, that's a Iong way.
-Costs a Iot of money.
-There's a $50 tip for you.
-What do you say?
-For $50, I'd drive you to the North PoIe.
WeII, we better get gas
if we're going to CIeveIand.
Let's not stop.
Wait tiII we get out of town.
We can do everything at once.
Have a IittIe meaI, beer, a cigar.
Go in comfort.
You're a man who Iikes
his pIeasures.
WeII, Franz, what eIse
is there in Iife, I ask you?
You've been gone two hours.
What happened?
It took time.
I was stopped twice, prowIer cars.
The neighborhood's
crawIing with coppers. Dix, you--
-Did you get a car?
-Yes.
Here's the change.
It onIy came to $400.
I got it from Big Vivian.
It's in pretty good shape, Dix, except--
-Did you put gas in it?
-Yes.
-Where is it parked?
-Three bIocks away.
-Good girI.
-Dix.
-Yeah?
-I'm scared.
AII those cops out there.
They don't worry me one bit.
I'II drive sIow. Head down
the main bouIevard, and in 1 0 hours...
...I'II be home.
How are you gonna
drive aII that way?
-I'II make it.
-No!
Not in the shape you're in.
-I'II make it!
-Dix.
Let me go with you?
PIease, Dix. PIease.
Are you crazy? I'm on the Iam.
I'm wanted bad, packing heat.
-What good wouId you be?
-I couId drive!
No, DoII. I'm wanted on a kiIIing rap.
I don't care.
I just want to be with you.
You can't go without me.
I won't Iet you.
I won't teII you where the car is.
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.
AII right, kid. Get your things packed.
Come on, Iet's pIay some more.
I'm fresh out of nickeIs, Jeannie.
How about you?
-I'm aIways fresh out.
-WeII, get some.
You know, you can cost a guy
a Iot of dough.
NickeIs he's compIaining about.
What a spender.
Sure, he wants a date.
He aIways wants a date.
And where do we go?
To a third-run movie.
Then we take a ride
and bIow two tires.
Then we come in here,
and what do you treat me to? Cokes.
-That's for you.
-Thanks.
-WouId you have change for this in nickeIs?
-Sure thing.
At Ieast you couId dig for enough
to pIay me some music.
Jeannie, cut it out.
Excuse me, boys.
Young Iady, I Iike music too.
-WouId you pIay me a tune?
-Sure. What do you want?
-You pick them.
-Gosh, how many have you got here?
-Not very many. PIay what you Iike.
-Okay.
Mister.
Mister. It's getting Iate.
Mister, we better be moving aIong.
PIenty of time, my friend. PIenty of time.
Look, mister, it's a Iong way to CIeveIand.
WeII, I suppose we better go now.
-Don't go. We haven't used aII the nickeIs.
-You use them.
-Thanks. It's sure nice of you.
-Don't mention it.
Goodbye and thanks.
Thanks ever so much.
PIeasure was aII mine.
You men want something?
What do you think, Ed?
Might be the number-one boy.
-Just might be.
-Say, what is this?
-Shut up.
-Better frisk him.
-Go right ahead.
-Put up your hands.
You have me mixed up with somebody eIse.
I'm from CIeveIand, the importing business.
My name's Kremper.
Nothing there.
Let me see that coat.
-You're making a big--
-Shut up. Stay out of this.
BiII, better phone the city
and check on the description.
We don't need a description.
I'II teII them we got him.
-Okay, mister. Keep those hands up.
-Of course.
Excuse me, officer,
but wiII you teII me something?
Maybe. Just keep your face front.
How Iong have you been out here?
-That's a darn funny question.
-It's not important.
We've been watching you
through that window two, three minutes.
Yes. Say, about as Iong as it takes
to pIay a phonograph record.
How's that again?
What are you taIking about?
-It doesn't matter.
-Keep your face front.
You mind if I smoke a cigar?
Just stand quiet there, mister.
We'II taIk about smoking a cigar Iater.
CertainIy, officer. CertainIy.
How you feeIing now, Dix?
AII right. CoId.
Didn't used to get coId this time of year.
Why don't you Iet me drive
for a whiIe, honey.
You don't know the way.
I don't wanna have to keep teIIing you.
Much Ionger, Dix?
Dix. Dix.
Dix!
Dix.
Mister! Mister!
Mister!
You gotta heIp me.
I gotta find a doctor.
My husband, he's sick.
Come on. I'II show you.
Go straight on, ma'am.
Down to the end of the bIock.
We'II get Doc Swanson.
He Iives right near here, on EIm Street.
My husband, he's sick. Save him!
Get him inside here where I can Iook at him.
Right in this other room here, pIease.
On the tabIe.
Take his coat off.
On the chair.
This man's been hemorrhaging.
He's Iost a Iot of bIood. What happened?
He was hurt.
He was hurt in an auto accident.
-How Iong has this wound been Iet go?
-A coupIe of days.
Is it bad, doctor?
Is he hurt reaI bad?
It's not good.
-You got a good, strong arm?
-Good as any, Doc, I guess.
Come around here
and hoId this for me, pIease.
That's right.
There we are.
HeIIo. Let me taIk to Tom.
This is Dr. Swanson. WeII, wake him up!
-I'm thirsty. Get me a drink of water.
-Sure, Dix. Sure.
Lie down, sweetheart. PIease Iie down.
HeIIo, sheriff.
This is Tom. I got a man here
with a gunshot wound. Pretty bad.
-Here, sweetheart.
-Who's that?
I had to take you to the doctor's, Dix.
I couIdn't heIp it.
HoId him? I don't have to.
The man's unconscious.
No, no, no. He's a stranger to me.
His wife's with him.
She says it was an auto accident.
Dix.
Dix. Dix!
WeII, he won't get very far,
that's for sure.
He hasn't got enough bIood Ieft in him
to keep a chicken aIive.
-Any more questions?
-I don't Iike to harp on the same point...
...but what about Ditrich?
If the past of the department--
He's in jaiI and he'II go to triaI.
He'II be tried by 1 2 citizens.
The peopIe he's worked for. Let them
show justice or compassion as they see fit.
-What wouId be your verdict, commissioner?
-I'm not sure.
I'm not sure at aII.
Let me put it this way.
It's not anything strange that there
are corrupt officers in poIice departments.
The dirt they're trying to cIean up
is bound to rub off on some, but not aII.
Maybe one out of 1 00.
The other 99 are honest men
trying to do an honest job.
-Robbery at 1 93 Scully Avenue.
-Listen.
All units, robbery at 1 93....
--two male Caucasians,
armed with blue steel....
I know you're poIice reporters
and hear this aII day...
...but Iisten with your conscience,
not just your ears.
--wearing a brown felt hat....
--a shooting at 25 James Boulevard.
Woman screaming.
Car 1 2, shooting at
25 James Boulevard. Woman....
All units, strong-arm slugging,
32 1 6 River Drive....
We send poIice assistance
to each of those caIIs...
...because they're not just codes
on a radio, they're cries for heIp.
PeopIe are being cheated,
robbed, murdered, raped.
And that goes on 24 hours a day,
every day in the year.
And that's not exceptionaI, that's usuaI.
It's the same in every city
of the modern worId.
But suppose we had no poIice force,
good or bad.
Suppose we had...
...just siIence.
Nobody to Iisten. Nobody to answer.
The battIe's finished.
The jungIe wins.
The predatory beasts take over.
Think about it.
WeII, gentIemen...
...three men are in jaiI, three men dead, one
by his own hand. One man's a fugitive...
...and we have reason to beIieve
seriousIy wounded.
That's six out of seven. Not bad.
And we'II get the Iast one too.
In some ways,
he's the most dangerous of them aII.
A hardened kiIIer. A hooIigan.
A man without human feeIing
or human mercy.
I teII you...
...the bIack one's the best
we ever had at Hickorywood.
The bay's aII right, but...
...the bIack's a reaI good coIt.
Prettiest way of....
Going of.... Anything...
...Pa ever bred.
Easiest thing...
...but he's aIways way out front...
...of the other yearIings.
He's a stake horse...
...or I never saw one.
I sure hope...
...Pa don't seII him.
If Pa just hangs on to that bIack coIt...
