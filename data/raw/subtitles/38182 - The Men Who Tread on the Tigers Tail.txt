In 1185 the Heike clan
perished in the Western Sea.
The victorious Yoshitsune should
have been parading through Kyoto...
...but the suspicious Shogun Yoritomo
distrusted even his own brother...
...and was advised by retainer Kagetoki
Kajiwara to try to kill Yoshitsune.
With no place to hide in Japan,
Yoshitsune took six retainers...
...dressed as monks and went to seek
the aid of Hidehira Fujiwara.
They are now about to pass a new
barrier...like stepping on a tiger's tail.

Over the mountain pass
Wringing out dew
From the sleeves
Where are you from, sir?
It seems like your first time around here.
Where are you headed?
It's nice that the weather's good.
This weather's rare.
Look...
There is the whole province of Kaga.
It's there.
What's in this? It's very heavy.
Silence!
Follow me quietly.
The song of the nightingale, eh?
Around here there are so many...
you could eat them.
How much further to the barrier?
Another mile, sir.
Let's rest a while.
You have a good pair of legs.
I've always been proud of mine...
..but I can't keep up with you.
He looks tired enough, though.
He's not at all like you other gentlemen.
He looks like a girl.
The path certainly is difficult
Is there another route?
There is, but...
...we'll all be killed if
the barrier officers see us.
Two men were killed just the other day.
It's such a problem.
All because Lord Yoritomo listened to
that Kaga something-or other...
...and began fighting with
Lord Yoshitsune, his own brother.
The barriers were set up
to catch the poor man.
I guess when you're a Shogun,
fighting with your brother is a big deal.
We as ordinary people can't stand it
The General may not be satisfied
Can they just have a fair fight
Brothers should be honest to each other
It's up to you to say I am a busy body
Hunting his brother like a beast!
Poor Lord Yoshitsune...
...the famous leader
of the Genji army is now a fugitive.
There's no need to worry, though.
They say he's got an amazingly
strong bodyguard: Benkei.
He's safe.
Benkei is seven feet tall; a giant priest.
He swings a one-ton iron rod.
He annihilates armies
of thousands single-handedly.
Unbelievable!
It makes others laugh
He can pull off a man's headed
like you'd pull up a daikon.
I hear he's not very smart.
They're traveling in disguise.
But everybody knows it,
even the barrier officers.
Stupid, eh?
How are they disguised?
Er... let me see...
What was it?
I heard one of the officers
say they were dressed as...
Not peddlers...
Not pilgrims...
Now I remember!
Traveling monks!
Isn't that funny?
They may suspect that you're
the party of Yoshitsune and Benkei.
Very funny, eh?
Very funny.
It can't be, can it?
Can it?
Don't try to scare me by
looking at me like that.
They know how many there are.
A seven-man party headed by
Yoshitsune...seven.
One. Two. Three. Four. Five...
Exactly.
Benkei!
My Lord.
Did you hear what this porter said?
Now it will be impossible to pass the
barrier in this disguise.
Why? There is only one small barrier,
Manned by a few guards.
We can overpower them easily.
It will be fun.
It will be good exercise
after all this time.
It would be easy to break
through the barrier.
But then, what will we
do about the others?
The road ahead is more important.
We must try to pass this barrier as
peacefully as possible.
Moreover...
...no decision will have to be made...
...unless they discover
our real identities.
In the first place, you are a real monk.
You are not in disguise.
The others can pass as monks, too.
You don't look like monks.
If ascetic training in rugged mountains...
would make one a real monk, then...
All of us indeed
become real monks.
We have a complete set
of monkish faces here.
We may be able to pass safely.
But...
Benkei!
They may be all right.
But our Lord is visible even to
the eyes of this stupid porter.
We have to do something...
...about that.
Porter!
Porter!
Come here.
I don't know a thing.
Spare my life...I won't say a word.
Bring that box here.
Stand up.
Rise.
He's frightened.
How do you calm a frightened man?
Shut up
He will recover if you
frighten him even more.
Get to your feet.
Get up, or I'll pull your head off.
You're so troublesome.
The startling beauty
of a crimson blossom...
...is seen even in a
garden laden with flowers.
Yet lesser blooms are overlooked,
and weeds unnoticed.
"And so, he removed
his brocade coat...
"...putting on the porter's
coarser weave.
"And over it here bore the load that had
been the least of his servants.
"He hid his face beneath
a hat of common cloth...
"...and leaned his burdened weight
upon a porter's staff.
"The sight of this spent bending lord,
who never carried a load before...
"...is painful to look upon
and we must sigh with grief.
His want of money outweighs his fear.
You're not careful about what
you say, you'll suffer for it.
It's not that. I came because
I couldn't stand to watch.
What did you say?
He doesn't look like a porter at all.
Anyone can see he's not.
First, that's no way to carry a load.
You're no greedy old woman running
off into the night.
Silence.
Why is it you again?
I was worried and...
...I can't leave knowing who you are.
I ought to see you over the barrier.
I am a man of honor.
What hunter would hurt a bird seeking
refuge in his very bosom?
You talk big.
We are not enemies, after all.
Let me help.
You're all right...in spite of your looks.
What shall we do?
We cannot ask a commoner for favors.
So, I'm not good enough, eh?
Pest!
Go away if you value your life.
But I found out something out at the barrier.
What? You wait.
What's this about the barrier?
It's worse than I thought.
All their troops are there.
What? All are their troops
They have known that Yoshitsune's party
must have taken this very road.
So the barrier keeper is expecting you.
Benkei!
What to do? Advance or retreat?
Now that our enemies
have come this far...
...we are trapped
whatever we choose to do.
We are trapped,
so we must break through.
We won't spare anybody,
not even the general himself.
We will attack and kill them all.
Good idea.
We will destroy everyone and
everything before we kill ourselves.
You fools!
I might overlook young warriors
talking like this.
But what's this all about?
If bravery was the only factor,
we'd have died several times already.
As I told you just now...
...this barrier isn't the last.
It's the most important
thing is our Lord's life.
Bravery comes after that.
Let us use this tactic.
We'll say we are traveling to solicit
contributions for the building of...
...the Todai Temple in Nara.
I am the Magistrate
of the Kaga Province.
Can you tell me about your visit
We are...
...traveling to solicit contributions for the
building of the Todai Temple.
We are to cover the northern district
and we wish to pass here.
I respect pious deeds.
However, the order is that no monks
will pass this barrier.
This is ridiculous indeed.
May I ask you the reason why?
Seven men, headed by Lord Yoshitsune
are traveling disguised as monks.
The General of Kamakura commanded
me to keep this barrier after he became...
...enemies with Yoshitsune.
This is indeed a nuisance.
I gather you were only told to stop
those disguised as monks.
It cannot be an order to stop all real
monks who may pass here.
How insolent!
Especially coming from
a seven-man party.
Please be reasonable.
Count us, please.
We are six traveling monks.
And two porters.
What a clown!
So long as I am here to exercise my
Lord's command...
Not even one shall ever pass.
They look suspicious.
Togashi, arrest them!
Togashi!
Togashi
Why do you not act?
This is the General's orders!
It's all right to kill one or two
of these "monks"
I order you to arrest them...
why do you hesitate?
What kind of place is this?
It is preposterous to command for no
reason the killing of disciples of Buddha
However...quarreling is no good.
Very well, we have no
alternative but to obey.
Everybody
Let us offer our last prayer.
I call Aryacalantha, the God of Fire,
to witness our sincerity.
In the name of the Avatar of Kumano...
...may heavenly punishment visit us at
once should our pledge be false.
Let me be the first to be bound.
I admire your resolution.
No one but a priest would
have such resignation.
However...
...you said that you're soliciting for
rebuilding of Todai Temple.
Then you must have the prospectus.
Let me hear you read it.
You want me to read the prospectus?
-I do.
Porter!
Bring that box here.
Ye pious followers...
...we deem that the autumnal moon
of the Enlightened...
...has eternally been hidden in the
cloud of Nirvana.
Mortals are indulging in the transient
pleasures of this life...
...with no one to surprise
them into awakening.
There lived an Emperor around the
middle of our history...
...whose faith in the doctrine of Buddha
made him very benevolent to his subjects.
He happened to have an inspired dream.
And in order to pray for the peace and
welfare of his people...
...he fashioned a great image of Buddha
and built a temple to shelter it.
Unfortunately, this temple was destroyed
during the turbulent era of Jisho.
Our reigning Emperor deeply
regrets its destruction.
By the Imperial Command, we are
recreating this Temple of temples...
...by soliciting contributions from all
parts of this Empire.
Those who participate, however small
the amount may be...
...thus will enjoy virtuous
pleasures in this life...
...not to mention the privilege of finding a seat
among the thousands of sacred lotus flowers.
Buddha help all sinners!
We reverently beseech you, ye pious.
That was indeed genuine.
However, let me ask
you a few questions.
Orders wear various robes...
but none so peculiar
as you traveling monks.
What is the reason?
I'm amazed at your ignorance.
All the manners of training differ,
so do the guises of all sects.
Our aim is both the attainment of both
Wisdom and Rigidity.
So we cross steep
mountains and passes...
...destroying snakes and evil animal
to help humanity.
We attend to morals and ethics, praying
for the peace and welfare of our land.
Therefore
...inwardly we are
forgiving and merciful...
...but outwardly we
militarily combat evil.
Why do you wear
the peaking cap on your heads?
They are our helmets as soldiers.
The robe we wear corresponds
to a suit of armor.
What about the metal rod?
It is based on the staff of Arada Kelema,
a hermit of Dantaloka in Sindhu.
It helps us clear the wilderness in our
austerities in attaining Truth...
...and to punish sinners.
Your sword?
Amidabha'a
Now...
You may cut material things...
...but what about immaterial evils?
We break them by the Spell of the
Nine Words.
What is it?
What we call the Spell of the Nine
Words consists of...
...these nine words: Ron, Pyo, To, Sha,
Kai, Jin, Zai, Retsu, Zen.
When one makes this Spell...
...he reverently stands and clenches
his teeth thirty-six times.
Then, with the thumb of his right hand...
...he draws five vertical lines,
four horizontal ones...
...and then shouts: Obey Promptly!
All kinds of devils, apparitions,
and heathens will immediately
be delivered from evil.
If you desire to know
more about our sect...
...I'll be happy to inform you.
Oh, I have nothing else to ask you.
Judging from the way you have replied,
you must be a distinguished teacher.
My suspicion of you is the greatest
error of my life.
As a gesture of apology, I will make a
contribution to your campaign.
How commendable.
I assure you of pleasure
in both existences.
Prepare the offering!
Wait!
We are on our way to
the northern districts...
...but we'll be back by mid April.
Please keep your offering until then.
I see.
We have wasted too much time.
We will be on our way.
Gentlemen...
"Leave as swiftly as you are able...
"...but not so swiftly that you would
appear less innocent.
"...rather  as though walking
from the viper's den...
"...rather as though you tread
upon the tail of the tiger."
Stop that porter!
Not that one, the one with the hat.
Wait!
What's wrong?
He looks like someone.
A man looking like someone-
that's not unusual.
I mean, he looks like Yoshitsune.
What? This porter looks
like Yoshitsune?
Weakling!
You're staggering along
under this light load.
No wonder people
think it looks strange.
We're always held up
by your lagging behind.
You're always getting us in trouble.
I will tolerate you no longer.
This isn't right.
Don't be so unreasonable.
You deserve this.
Get up and move.
Wait!
He resembles Yoshitsune very closely.
So you've been eying his load.
Are you a thief?
What!
No I see why you've been so...
unreasonable.
Barrier-keeper, huh?
Shut up
This is wicked audacity.
On guard!
If this had been Yoshitsune...
...none of them would dare strike him.
But, Togashi...
There is no vassal who would strike
his own master.
You may pass.
Togashi...
It is I who am in charge here!
We are safe now, gentlemen...
Let's rest.
I must say I was surprised when
Benkei raised his stick.
Only Benkei could think of such a plan.
Now I see!
I though he suddenly lost his mind.
Pumpkin head!
An unforgivable sin...
...even if it was a desperate measure.
Benkei...
...do not apologize.
What I have done will make my arm rot.
It is not this hand that struck me.
It was heavenly protection. The holy
hand of the God of War guarded me.
I am thankful.
May they all go to the devil.
I've brought gifts to you from the
Magistrate Togashi.
He apologizes for being rude to you.
How considerate of him.
First, please accept this drink.
"After danger is averted, then is
kindness savored...
"...sympathy gratefully accepted, and
gratefully received...
"...though one had not expected in
regions wild as these...
"...the cup of friendship, the taste of
kindness, the very grail of humanity."
Another drink?
I thank you.
Who will dance?
You there, porter!
Dance to celebrate our drinking!
A turtle lives on top of a rock...
I, too, will dance before I bid farewell.
"Though the cascades sound...
"...inviting us to stay...
"...though the sun shines brightly
asking us to linger...
"...still, we must move onward...
"...else we may not arrive."
