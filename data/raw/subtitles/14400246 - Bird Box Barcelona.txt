Can I open my eyes now?
Not yet. We're almost there.
Where are we?
Just a second. You'll see.
Okay. Open them.
You must've really missed it.
You're skating with me.
- No.
- Oh yeah.
- Anna, please don't.
- You have to. Come on.
Anna, wait!
Sheesh.
- Don't laugh.
- Come on, Dad. Relax.
Try bending your knees a little.
Hang on. I'm not the pro here.
You are. I just paid for the lessons.
You're gonna get dizzy, show-off.
Backpack. Goggles.
Let's go.
I don't need to see you to kick your ass.
Hand it over!
Give it to me!
Hurry. Take 'em all.
There's one here.
Bring the bag.
Let's go.
Come on. Let's go.
Thanks.
What for?
For not letting me hurt them.
They were just hungry.
Ready?
Ready.
Everyone should wear blindfolds
or blacked-out goggles outside.
Any means necessary to cover your eyes
and avoid visual contact
with these beings...
You know what to do.
Not to come out until you call me.
Until I make sure they're good people.
Hello?
Is anyone there?
Hello?
Who's there?
My name is Sebastián.
I'm injured.
I haven't eaten in days.
We can't help you. I'm sorry.
I went out looking for food,
but I can't find my way back home.
- What do we do?
- Keep moving.
- Let's hear him out. Wait.
- Fucking go.
I'm sorry.
I know where to find a generator.
- A generator?
- I work in construction.
Or used to. As an engineer.
My company...
I know where they stored the generators.
They're too heavy to carry by myself,
but with your help...
I think we all could use a little... light.
Heating.
- Come on, Marcial. We need it.
- I don't trust him.
Don't you agree?
Please.
Are you alone?
Yes.
They're coming. Let's go!
Let's go!
Sebastián, grab onto the rope.
Go!
Open up! It's Marcial!
Close the door.
CLOSE ONE DOOR BEFORE OPENING ANOTHER
USE YOUR BLINDFOLD
Who's that?
He was lost.
He says he knows
where to find a generator.
Jesus.
You weren't kidding.
What happened to you?
You look like a boxer.
More like a punching bag.
This way.
Let the doctor take a look at you.
- You have a doctor?
- Sure.
We have a doctor, a carpenter, a mechanic.
You wouldn't know
how to cook by any chance?
The guy on cooking duty now...
I think he learned how to cook in prison.
Doctor? Doctor.
Marcial. Call me Liliana, please.
I've got a patient for you.
See if there's anything
you can do with that face.
- Does it hurt?
- Only when I breathe.
Well, your nose isn't broken.
So that's good news.
You need stitches on your eyebrow.
So, tell me
who did this to you?
Blind people.
Well... out there, we're all blind.
I wasn't outside.
- This happened indoors? No blindfold?
- Yes.
- And they managed to...?
- It was three against one.
It was very dark.
Do me a favor.
Don't tell the others.
It'll be our secret.
Can I tell you mine?
I was actually a dentist.
Here I go.
You must be starving.
Go on. Help yourself.
- Thank you.
- Here.
You're staring.
What?
You're staring.
I'm sorry.
I could wear a blindfold
or sunglasses if I wanted.
But I want people to see and... realize.
Realize what?
That there are worse things
than the creatures.
Worse?
Most kill themselves when they see them.
But not everyone.
At first, we thought they wanted our food.
But they were not wearing blindfolds.
They came from the outside
with their eyes wide open.
They had seen the creatures.
And it was like...
something had snapped
in here.
And now they wanted us to see.
They wanted the whole world to see.
They grabbed Rosa first.
One of them, their leader...
he smudged his thumb on some charred wood.
And he drew an eye
on her forehead with ash.
Then they dragged her outside.
I couldn't see her, but I could hear her.
Screaming.
I still do.
That's when I noticed the knife.
It was sitting there. On the table.
I knew I had to be fast.
That if I hesitated, they'd stop me.
So I grabbed the knife, and I was. Fast.
After that, they lost interest in me.
I couldn't see anymore.
When we found him,
he was wandering the streets, lost.
Sebastián, what are you doing?
Hey, Sebastián!
No, Sebastián. Stop!
- Help!
- What's going on?
What are you doing?
- What the hell?
- Marcial, help me!
Open up!
Stop!
- Stop!
- Open up!
Get back!
Fuck! Open up!
Stop it!
Look.
They're coming.
They're beautiful, aren't they?
It's okay. It's going to be all right.
Don't be afraid.
It's for your own good.
When you see them, you'll understand.
No, please!
No, please, no!
See?
My love?
What's wrong?
What are you doing?
Wait.
Oh God. What have you done?!
What have you done?
I'm sorry, Lázaro.
I'm sorry you won't get to see.
I'm sorry.
Why?
You saved them, Dad.
They'll be all right?
Of course. Their souls are free now.
You saw their light, didn't you?
It's so beautiful there.
I wish you could see it.
When?
When will it be my turn?
Soon. But there are still
too many lost sheep.
You're their shepherd, Dad.
Save them, and we'll be together again.
You, me, and Mom.
NINE MONTHS EARLIER
Not too shabby, huh, boss?
Ten thousand more like this,
and we may still save the world.
Give me a sec.
- Turbines one and two?
- Yes.
They're both offline?
Since ten o'clock.
But how?
I understand if one worker fell
into a turbine...
- Several.
- Several?
Several workers.
Fell into both turbines?
Or jumped.
Someone says they saw them jump.
Everything all right?
The Düsseldorf hydropower plant is down.
And we wrap up
with devastating news out of Poland,
where a head-on collision
between two commuter trains
has left dozens dead
in the outskirts of Warsaw.
The cause of the accident
is still unknown,
but sources suggest
that the engineer on one of the trains
ignored the railway signals.
The government...
Honey, where are you?
I just got to the office. Everything okay?
Have you seen the news?
The train in Poland?
No. It's not just Poland.
Just turn on the news, please.
- Turn on the news.
- Hang on. Give me a second.
It's happening everywhere.
It's happening here.
...appears to have spread
to the rest of Europe.
The WHO describes it
as a wave of psychotic behavior
that leads to self-harm
and, in some cases, suicide.
What we are seeing are not,
I repeat, are not isolated incidents.
According to reports, there have been...
- Jesus.
- ...hundreds of deaths in Madrid alone.
Can you go get Anna?
Yes. Of course.
Right now.
I'm leaving right now.
Move!
Come on!
CASES REPORTED ACROSS EUROPE
Sorry. Excuse me.
NEXT TRAIN ARRIVES
Where is my daughter?
Hey! No.
It's all right. It's okay.
Hey, Anna.
Hey, sweetie. Look at me.
It's Dad. It's all right.
We gotta go.
Have you seen Paula?
Here I am!
Father.
- You're taking Anna home?
- Yes.
Laura's waiting.
We're leaving Barcelona for a few days.
You're not ready to see, then?
See what?
I don't know... but I am ready.
I've been waiting all my life.
I joined the seminary at 18.
I was looking for a sign.
- I don't follow.
- And, in all this time, nothing.
I feared that I'd been born
in the wrong time.
That the days of miracles
and prophets were long gone.
Let us through, please.
The Lord commanded Moses
from the flames
of the burning bush.
He challenged Job
as a furious whirlwind.
But for me... there's only been... silence.
Until now.
People are dying, Father.
Does that look like a miracle to you?
To look the Lord in the eye
may be more than our minds can endure.
But if God and his angels
are walking the earth now,
I want to greet them.
Don't you?
I just want my daughter to be safe.
Of course you do.
They say that faith
is believing in what you can't see.
But I need to see.
Whatever happens, whatever you hear,
keep your eyes on it, okay?
All lines are busy at the moment.
Please try again later.
All lines...
It's okay. We are almost there.
Honey!
Finally. Honey!
- My love, are you okay?
- Mom?
- It's me. Are you okay? Yes?
- Yes.
- What about you?
- I'm fine.
Are you sure?
- The car?
- Packed and ready. Let's go.
Laura, watch out!
Are you...?
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been a week since my last confession.
I took the Lord's name in vain.
More than once.
I've been tempted
by those living less solitary lives.
I envied them.
There's one more thing.
I lied.
I had no choice. I had to save them.
But still, I lied.
Can the Lord forgive someone
who lies to be reunited with his family?
Brother...
You've seen them too.
Their ships have traveled
millions of light-years.
They'll take us to the stars.
No, brother.
They're angels.
They're glorious.
PHARMACY
Hello?
Is anyone there?
- Who the fuck are you?
- I...
Why the fuck are you sneaking up on us?
Easy, Jonás. Easy.
I've been robbed, okay?
Beaten up.
Who am I supposed to trust?
Well, it ain't us.
Hey. You have to hold on tighter.
Got it?
- Yes?
- Are you okay?
I'm fine.
What is it, Dimas?
What is it, boys?
Shit.
Let's go! Now!
- Take me with you.
- We're not running an NGO, man.
You wanna stay
and make friends, be my guest.
But I'm outta here.
I can get you a generator.
I know where they store them.
- I can take you there.
- Right.
I'm an engineer. My company...
I know where they kept the generators.
- Where?
- First, take me with you.
Come on. Let's go!
Keep up because I'm not waiting for you.
You brought someone?
He says he has a generator.
Isabel, don't worry. I've got him.
Where are we?
An old bomb shelter from the war.
If these walls
could keep out the fascists' bombs,
they can keep those things out too.
Can someone remind the history teacher
who won the war?
We're holding out.
It's not winning, but it's something.
- Who's that?
- He says he has a generator.
- Chocolate!
- Chocolate.
Your accent's so silly.
How about some real food
for the grown-ups?
You.
With me.
This is Octavio. I'm Rafa.
You?
Are you alone, Sebastián?
Yes.
And those stitches?
Did you do that on your own?
I was with this group.
We had a doctor.
And where's your doctor now?
Dead.
They're all dead.
Did you kill them, Sebastián?
- They saw the creatures.
- But you didn't.
I hid.
When the men came, I hid.
What men?
They roam the city.
Without blindfolds.
They want the world to see.
- What are you talking about?
- About what's going on out there.
Above this cozy little hole of yours.
Give me the map.
Where is it?
- Where's what?
- The generator. Where is it?
One of them will go with you.
Maybe two.
But when you come back alone,
the rest will be suspicious.
They'll be afraid of you.
They won't understand.
- Come on!
- You need to get them all out.
What the fuck are you waiting for?
The girl.
Use the girl.
- There isn't one.
- What do you mean?
The generator. I made it up.
- Hey, Rafa, come on.
- Motherfucker.
- What's going on here?
- Easy, Rafa.
- He lied!
- What are you talking about?
- Isabel, stay out of this.
- There's no generator.
I'm sorry, okay?
Oh, you're sorry. Well, in that case...
I was alone. Scared.
I had to come up with something!
- So you fucking lie to our faces?
- You were going to leave me there.
So we catch this asshole
creeping up on you,
now he lies to our fucking faces,
and you're gonna take his side?!
Hey, don't look at me.
It wasn't my call to let him in.
That's easy to fix.
No, please don't.
- We can't just kill the guy. Come on.
- Don't worry. He'll do that by himself.
Hey, Rafa. Stop.
I don't know what the fuck you're saying!
She's asking you not to hurt me.
It's okay.
I'll be fine.
I promise.
Where are your parents?
We were on vacation, Mom and I.
We were gonna get on a boat.
A cruise ship.
I was excited.
It was my first time on a boat.
We were going up the ramp
when someone screamed.
People started... pushing
and shoving each other.
Hard. And I got scared.
Suddenly, I saw
someone fall into the water.
Then I saw...
another one jump,
and another and another...
What happened next?
I don't know
how we managed to get out of there.
Mom picked me up and covered my eyes.
When I opened them, we were in a van.
And my mom, she'd covered
all the windows with paper and cardboard.
She turned on the radio.
We couldn't hear anything at first,
but then we heard this voice.
This woman.
She said...
She said there was a safe place.
Up the mountain.
It looks like Montjuïc.
How so?
Castle, mountain, Barcelona.
It's Montjuïc.
Isabel, don't be stubborn.
It could be the Alcázar in Toledo
for all we know.
Who knows what station
they were listening to.
Did you go? To the mountain?
You had to take that.
The aerial tramway.
Told you it's Montjuïc.
My mom used a scarf to cover my eyes.
Outside, people were screaming,
running, crying.
Mom held my hand so tight it hurt.
People kept crashing into us.
Then I fell.
It was my fault.
I let go of her hand.
She told me to hold on tight...
It's not your fault. You hear me?
It's not your fault.
Sorry. I don't mean to be insensitive,
but am I the only one who heard
the part about a "safe place"?
Isabel, we're in a bomb shelter.
A castle was good for the Middle Ages.
If I had to set up a refugee camp,
that would be the place.
On higher ground. Surrounded by walls.
You seal the place off.
Use the tramway
as the only way in and out.
The survivors get in, those things don't.
Now the dog trainer here
thinks he's General Patton.
Watch it, man. I was in the reserves.
Are we seriously considering this?
We don't know if it still works.
If the tramway's still running
or the walls are still standing.
Thank you.
At least the pizza guy
talks some sense.
I think we should go.
Yeah, well, nobody asked you.
Let him speak.
And don't you dare tell me to shut up.
- If Sofia's mother is still alive...
- That's a big "if."
...then chances are she went to the castle.
Neither of them knows the city,
but they both heard of the place.
Montjuïc is all the way across town.
And you never know when you're going
to run into one of those things.
It's suicide. You know that, right?
It's literally suicide.
And for what? To find out
the girl's mom is already dead?
- Jesus. Enough.
- She doesn't know what I'm saying!
What happens when you run out of food?
You can't grow it in a tunnel.
Staying here is suicide.
It may be a slow one,
but it's still suicide.
Let's take a vote, then.
- They let you vote in your country?
- Fuck you, Marqués.
Who thinks we should go?
I hate to admit it, but he's right.
- Don't you dare...
- I'm sorry, honey.
You're on your own, Roberto.
You know what?
I've lived in Barcelona for 30 years
and never gone up to Montjuïc.
Well, now you can
cross it off your bucket list.
Rise and shine, Sleeping Beauty.
Get up.
Easy, big guy. I know. I hate them too.
Take it easy.
Almost done. Good boy. That's right.
That's it, big guy. Good boy.
Here goes nothing.
Easy boy. Okay. Easy.
257 Diputación Street.
We should take the next left.
That's it. Good job.
EIGHT MONTHS EARLIER
In 15 meters, turn left.
Turn left.
In ten meters,
you will reach your destination.
You have reached your destination.
Hello?
My daughter has a fever.
She needs a doctor.
Hello?
Is anyone there?
I'm sorry, honey.
If Mom was here, she'd know what to do.
Can you hear that?
They're singing.
How dare you?
Look at me when I'm talking to you, bitch!
Come. I don't want my husband to see us.
Octavio, where are you? I can't see you.
My darling, where are you?
Come. I can't find you.
Mom?
Honey, come to Mommy.
Come here!
Come here, Dimas!
Sofia, I'm here.
Mom?
Come here, boy!
Hang on...
Come here, Sofia!
Mom?
Sofia, come here.
Here, boy.
Come here.
Where are you, boys?
Come here.
Mom, where are you?
Take your blindfold off.
Let me see those beautiful eyes.
Let me see them.
Are you sure?
Yes, it's okay.
It's okay because Mom is here.
Where are you, my boys?
What's wrong?
Are you hurt?
Where are you?
Come on. Easy.
Fuck!
We have to go.
Hurry up.
Over here!
Yes.
Where is he? Where's Rafa?
Shut the door!
Where's Rafa?
I don't think he made it.
He's dead.
Shut the door.
There are no windows.
You can take off your blindfolds.
That looks like shit, Marqués.
I have gauze.
If you ask me nicely.
I heard you.
Roberto, please don't.
I heard you. With him.
That wasn't me.
You think I don't know the sound
of my wife fucking someone else?
That's not what I...
You want to know what I heard?
- I really don't.
- What you said to me.
The day you found out. Remember?
I'll finish this.
Where do you get all this crap?
Shut up, you asshole.
Why? Because I delivered
your food for a living?
I have a degree in physics
from the University of Mexico.
I'm still waiting for your country
to recognize my degree.
How much was the bribe?
How much did you pay for the degree?
Is that crown of yours heavy, king?
You ever take it off?
Where's the girl?
No, calm down.
You two, bickering like children,
and we lose the actual child.
Don't cry.
Is she dead?
No.
How do you know?
Do you know what this is?
A seraph.
The most beautiful of all the angels.
Their beauty is so great
that only God can look straight at them.
It's beautiful.
It's yours.
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
Hail Mary.
- Full of grace. The Lord is with thee...
- Please, don't!
No, please let go of me. Please, don't!
Please don't!
No, please!
You're nervous, I know.
So was I.
What you're about to see
can't be put into words.
It's the Alpha and the Omega.
It's eternity itself.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Three days...
- Dad.
- "Dad," what?
It's your birthday.
How often are you going to turn 11?
- Just the once?
- Just the once.
It's going to be crazy.
A cake, dance party.
We're going to have a clown, even
if it means sticking my face in flour.
I'm turning 11, Dad, not 5.
Right.
Good night, honey.
It was mine.
What?
The angel.
It was mine.
You and Mom gave it to me
for my first communion.
It was my favorite.
She was scared.
- She needed...
- She's not your daughter.
I know.
- She's just another sheep.
- I know.
Help her find the way,
and we'll be together again.
Don't listen to her.
She's lying to you.
She wants you to lose faith, Dad.
Roberto, what's wrong?
What's wrong with him?
Damn it, Marqués.
Hello?
Please, we need help.
One of us is injured.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Make sure the windows are shut.
The kitchen's secured!
RAT POISON
Sebastián, I found some cans of sardines.
Is your room secured?
Yes. Everything's shut.
I don't understand.
Her blindfold.
Take it off.
Do it, Dad. Save her.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Slow down, okay?
- That's it.
- Thank you.
What would you do without me?
I wasn't gonna do it.
The divorce, I mean.
I wasn't gonna go through with it.
Oh yeah?
I was angry.
Hurt.
Mostly my pride.
- And I was very lonely, Roberto.
- I know.
My lawyers were out for blood, and...
But I wasn't gonna go through with it.
Lucky you because my lawyers
were gonna get you for all you're worth.
Did you find anything?
Where's Octavio?
I did find this though.
It's not much, but it's an antibiotic, so...
What happened?
But...?
Why didn't you do it?
Why didn't you take her blindfold off?
- I didn't see it.
- See what?
His... light.
When Octavio was...
I didn't see it.
That's because you're losing
your faith, Dad.
What if I'm not the shepherd, Anna?
What if I'm the wolf?
Run. Make a chain.
A chain. Come on.
Come on! Run!
Go!
Come on!
My leg.
Come on.
What would I do without you?
I guess this is it.
I want to see you one last time.
Open the door, Dad.
Open the door and let them see.
Two more...
Two more, and we can be together.
- You, me, Mom... together.
- Stop it.
- We miss you, Dad.
- I need you to stop, please.
- Don't you miss us?
- Just stop, all right? I can't think.
- I need to think!
- Dad!
Find them, Dad. Save them.
It's okay.
You don't have to be afraid. You hear me?
Everything's going to be okay.
They're the most beautiful
of all the angels, remember?
Save her, Dad.
Do it for her.
For me.
Do it, Dad. It's the only way.
Please, no.
Don't you miss me?
Of course. Of course I do.
Don't you want us to be together again?
I miss you so much.
Then do it. It's the only way.
Who are you talking to?
Is that...
Is that Anna?
She's not your daughter, Dad! She's not...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Dad!
I can't hear you, but happy birthday
Happy birthday to you!
What?
Nothing.
Just glad you like it.
Oh no. Thank you.
I'm watching my weight.
Bikini season's around the corner.
Go to your room.
Now!
- Daddy?
- Sweetie.
You're awake, but you're actually asleep.
We're living in an age of miracles.
Open your eyes and see.
Anna, listen.
Don't open your eyes.
Whatever you do, keep them closed.
You hear me?
It's okay.
Don't listen to him.
Don't be afraid.
Don't listen to him!
Don't touch her!
Don't touch her!
- Anna!
- No, please, don't!
The days of prophets
and wonders have returned.
Father?
Come and see.
Close your eyes. Don't look.
It's beautiful.
No! Close your eyes! Don't look!
Keep your eyes closed! My love...
My love, look away.
Don't look!
Come and see, Dad.
It's okay, Dad.
We'll be together again soon.
Claire, I'm here!
Search the apartments.
Where are you going?
You could get hurt up there, you know?
That thing doesn't look very safe.
We just want to leave.
Hi, sweetie.
- Come here. I want to show you something.
- Please leave her alone.
Yeah? Or what?
You think you're helping her
by not letting her see.
You've seen them.
But you reject their gift.
You're not worthy!
What happened?
Dad.
They saw you.
They saw the candle. They heard you sing.
You are a very brave girl, Sofia.
I'm going to need you
to take care of Claire.
My friend.
Why did you leave us?
Because deep down,
I always knew you killed her.
Beware of false prophets who come
to you dressed in sheep's clothing.
Inside, they are ravenous wolves.
- Beware of false prophets...
- Brother...
...who come to you dressed
in sheep's clothing.
Let us pass.
Inside they are ravenous wolves.
Beware of false prophets...
I am the right hand of the Lord.
I'm a humble instrument of his will.
His will?
You follow the will of those things.
Do not get in the way of his will.
Don't turn your back on God!
That is not my God!
Let them through.
- No.
- He saved me, Dad.
Don't you want him to save them?
Don't you want them to be free?
Come.
You're not real.
You're dead.
Sofia, come. I'm here.
It's Mommy.
Sofia, come.
Sofia, come!
Sofia, take off your blindfold! Look at me!
You won't survive this.
But they will.
Your hands.
Show me your hands.
Anyone else coming up?
What?
Help them.
We have two survivors.
A woman and a child. Unarmed.
We're bringing them in for questioning.
My darling!
My darling! I've missed you so much!
You're so big now!
Follow me.
Let me see it!
I want to see it!
