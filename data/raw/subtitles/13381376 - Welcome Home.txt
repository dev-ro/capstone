Vaibhav:I spoke to the Pandit yesterday itself.
Mother was saying that an ausipicious date of three months
hence would be correct.
A gap of more than three months doesn't look good.
Especially as you work alone in another town. People make up
stories then, you can understand that.
I'll take care of all the venue bookings as well. I have to
speak to your father as well.
The car has to be booked now by him.
if we want the delivery by the wedding date.
I'll take a leave from office also for the wedding.
For the wedding and honeymoon, 15 days should suffice.
My friends were saying that we should go to Goa for the
bachelors party.
You do one thing, come over next week.
Mother needs to start with the shopping.
She has selected some stuff for me... you as well.
Anuja: I cannot take a leave now Vaibhav.
It is my first day tomorrow.
I'll try sometime next month..
Vaibhav: Listen the preparations for our wedding cannot stop
for you.
Is your job more important than the wedding?
Anuja: Uncle the duplicate key?
Landlord: I looked for it but couldn't find it.
I'll give it to you tomorrow.
That's ok. Thank you.
Just check for the water and all.
Yes will check.
Alright.

Vaibhav: So you come over next week and don't give these
silly reasons about your job.
Is the school going to close if you don't go for a few days?
You anyway have to quit after a few months and come here.
Then give importance to the things that are important.
And anyway, mother doesn't like the fact that you work.
So whenever you speak to her, don't throw this working woman
attitude.
Got it?
Anuja:(pleading) Vaibhav you are making a mountain out of...
Vaibhav: (Angry) This isn't a molehill. This may be small
for you...
I'll have a word with your father about this. Things cannot
go on like this.
What is mother supposed to tell people? The girl is busy
with work?
Anuja: I am just requesting that....
Vaibhav: What?
This is a major problem that needs to be sorted.
I'll speak to your father.
Anuja (pleading): No Vaibhav please don't tell him.
Vaibhav: No this cannot go on like this. This is not how
marriage works.
I am a grown up, I have seen the world, I understand
things.
Anuja: No please Vaibhav no please.
Vaibhav: Am speaking to your father. I don't want to say
anything else.

Plead, beg or kiss his feet.
If he's asking you to quit your job then quit it dammit.

Why the fuck would you go to that place!
And what do you call this nonsense? Who the fuck got this

No one. I bought it myself.

NEW BORN BABY CRIES
Vaibhav: (on the phone) Yes but it has already been a month
since you went there. We haven't even met properly.
Everyone keeps asking about you here. Even. My colleagues
were asking where is our dear sister in law,
And since I've had my promotion, they've started
asking even more questions.
Vaibhav: Parashar aunty also came by the other day.
Was enquiring whether our wedding is still happening or no.
She wants me for her neice.
You need to watch out.
I have a lot of options apart from you. But if I go away,
who will you find?
Neha: Have you lost your mind!
We'll just check on her and come back at once. We even know
the way properly now.
Even if her husband beats her, abuses her, what has that got
to do with you?
Didn't your father ever hit your mother?
My brother beats me up everyday. So what?
I am not going back there.
Didn't you find those people odd?
They were horrendously odd.
But I am not going back.
Please come along.
Neha: No.
Bhola: Oh! You girls have come again. Wow!
Anuja: Yes we'd come for the census count.
Bhola: Oh yes.
Please come in, why are you standing outside.
I'll open the door for you.
Please please come in.
Let's go.
Hello Aunty. How are you?
These girls had come for the census count the other day
remember. It's them.
Please come in. Sit.
Prerna doesn't seem to be around.
She's unwell. Yes.
May we meet her once?
Didn't I say she is unwell.
Since when have you been staying in this house?
Anuja: Hello.
We had some other...
Leela: (cutting across) I had told you that two girls had
come for the census count. It's them.
How many people are there in this house?
Leela: Four
Anuja: Since when have you been living here?
It's been around 20-25 years.
He's on a vow of silence for 5 years. It has been 3 years
already, 2 years remaining.
How is the child?
(awkard laugh) Surely must have been born by now.

Let's leave now. Didn't you notice how that lady stopped us.
Let's go.
Leave and go where?
Take a look outside, you can't see anything.

Sorry. This is all my fault.
It's alright.
You didn't do this on purpose.

Neha: Tell me one thing
if your phone hadn't fallen in the water, whom would you
call?
My Mother.
She would have done anything to get me out of here.
Neha: Means your mother was a strong woman.
Anuja: Not at all.
My father beat her up all her life
but she never uttered a word.
But for me she would fight with the world.
Neha: Means your mother was a strong woman.
This even your mother will do.
No. My mother doesn't.
My mother bears everything very quietly.
I mean no matter what someone says or does to her, she takes
it quietly.
That is why, even when my brother beats me up..
I never go and tell her.
Because she scolds me for even that, telling me to behave as
per his wishes.
It's not her fault.
That whole generation of women functions that way.
Maybe that is the right way.
You take shit from your fiance..
I get beat up by my brother.
Even this Prerna is getting beaten up by her old husband.
We're proof.
Two girls set out to do something on their own and landed in

I am Naru.
My sister has been roaming around with your wife the past
month.
Mister she is my fiance.
Hmmm..
I visited the school just now.
They say she's been having an affair with the Amol Joshi
fellow.
Your dear fiance!
First you need to start speaking with some respect.
She is not that kind of girl.
Oye!
Don't tell me what she is and is not. I know everything that
goes around here.
Motherfucker! She's run off with my sister in tow.
Who do you think you are abusing?
You! What the fuck are you going to do you dick?
Fuck your happiness if I want to.
Who do you think you are talking to you shitfaced asshole?
Landlord: What do you think you guys are doing?
Have you lost your mind?
Your sister fiance are missing..
and you both are assuming that they've run off?
Go to the cops and file a complaint.
Ohh! What am I supposed to tell the cops?
Naru's sister ran away?
I'll lose face in the whole town.
Naru: And listen you fucker...
If you want to go to the cops and tell them who all your
fiance is blowing, do...
Vaibhav: I..
Naru: Listen.
Naru: Please Do. But neither mine nor my sister's name
should come anywhere near that complaint.
You make sure he understands.
