I have some good news.
Spit it out, already.
So, this Albanian dude,
Benzo, right?
He comes into the pharmacy
all the time.
I hook him up
with some Cialis, no biggie.
We're shooting the shit,
 and he tells me
he manages Cheeters,
 the gentlemen's club
off of Route Four,
and they just so happen to be
looking for some live music
to go with their live dancing.
So, I hustled him
into booking us,
P, B, N, Motherfuckin' J,
in three weeks for a record
release show at Cheeters.
Bam! I'm a baller.
Really, Jheri? A titty bar?
It's PG-13 shit.
Bikini tops, boy shorts.
Totally family friendly.
Yeah, but we only
got one song.
So we go all in. You have
notebooks full of songs, P.
-How badly do you want this?
-Real fuckin' bad.
Exactly.
So we record our asses off.
Then we wallpaper the town
with flyers.
And then we kill the show.
Man, once the buzz spreads,
this dump is in the rearview

Ever since Junior High.
Dumbo Dumbrowski.
So what's your real name?
Like, what do your parents
call you?
Where'd you go to high school?
(train horn blowing)
Hear that?
That's how I'm getting out.
Hopping freight trains, yard
to yard, across the country.
I think that's what
real freedom is.
Kinda like a hobo?
That's cool.

What the hell happened?
She had a stroke.
All right, look...
the hospital's asking

They're gonna clean us out.
Jesus. What do we do?
I guess I'll open

I'll shuffle

and I'll see how much time
I can buy her. Okay?
Okay.
You're gonna have
to go fulltime.
Yeah, noon to 8:00.
Yes.
No, that wasn't his fault.
It just overflowed.
Very good.
I don't got all day.
Well, sir, you know,
I think I've done
an excellent job thus far.
And I work hard, and I smile.
And even you said
that this was my calling.
-I was just hoping that maybe--
-All right, all right.
You wanna try out

-Yeah.
-Today is your lucky day.
Saturday, Alpine.
-Okay.
-Noon to 8:00.

Two point four.

Because it's the perfect

It's a snapshot of an artist's
