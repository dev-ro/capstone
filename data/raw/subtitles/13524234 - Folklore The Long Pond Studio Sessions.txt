Okay, so it is 8:30 in the morning.
And, "Why am I awake?" you ask.
Well, it's kind of a long story.
Um, I sort of unexpectedly
started writing the new album,
and, at that point, I was just like,
"I'm just writing songs
in quarantine," and then they're...
It just became an album really quickly
and really, really kind of beautifully,
surprisingly.
And, so...
You can't go into studios now
because they're all closed,
and I've never recorded anywhere else.
Um, and I know that other people
do this all the time,
so it's actually not that special,
but I'm freaking out over it.
We've built a home studio in my house.
And so, it's, like...
I'm gonna do vocals today in my house.
It's... I'm very excited about it.
Okay, so over there is where
my recording booth is,
and then on the other side of the wall...
Laura!
- Hey.
- Yeah.
Jack?
Holy shit.
It's like you're right there,
but instead, you're in New York.
I'm freaking out. We've never done this.
This is crazy.
-First day we've been in the same room.
-Cheers. Yeah.
First moment.
That's so weird.
I think when lockdown happened,
I just found myself completely listless
and purposeless and...
That... Then that was in
the first three days of it.
And then... And then I remembered
- when we met a year before.
- Yeah.
And I'd come to The National show,
and afterward you would come up
and talk to me, and you were so nice.
And I was like,
"How do you guys write songs?"
You were like, "We all live in different
places, so sometimes I'll just make tracks
and send them around
and send them to Matt."
And I just kind of thought to myself,
"If there was ever an opportunity
to work with someone I was such a fan of
who could work like that,
that would be so cool."
Then lockdown happened,
and I texted you, and I was like,
"Hey. Would you even wanna work?
Do you... Are you in that place right now?"
And I was like, "I don't know
if this is a real text.
I'm not sure."
Seemed like a bit? Like a friend...
Well, I was like,
"Is someone pretending? No."
I feel like it's also...
One of the reasons why it resonates
with me so much is because
in the dismantling of all our systems
of life that we've known in the pandemic,
you're left with two options.
You either cling to it
and try to make it work
or to just say, "Well, I guess
I'm just gonna chart a new path,"
and kinda get a frontier mentality.
And I think it was such a thrilling use
of quarantine to say like,
"Well, everything's a blur,
so I'm just gonna rewrite it."
Yeah.
I... I didn't even tell my label
until a week before we put it out
-that it existed.
-What was that call like?
It was amazing.
I thought it was gonna be stressful,
and I thought I was gonna
have to kind of stand up,
with shaking hands being like,
"I promise I know what I'm doing.
I know that there's not,
like, a big single,
and I'm not doing, like, a big pop thing,
and I'm not... "
But they... My label was like,
"Whatever you wanna make, we're down."
You ready to play this whole thing?
Yeah, no. I... I... I think it's really
important that we play it.
I think it will take that for me
to realize that it's a real album.
- Seems like a big mirage.
- It does.
Never worked on an album like this.
Me neither.
Yeah.
I don't know if I ever will again.
Like, I don't know if it's how albums
are meant to be made.
It just worked right now.
There's something about the complete
and total uncertainty about life
that causes endless anxiety,
but there's another part
that causes sort of a release
of the pressures that you used to feel.
Because if we're going
to have to recalibrate everything,
we should start
with what we love the most first.
And I think that was what we were
sort of unconsciously doing with this.
- Totally. That is it exactly.
- Yeah.
If everything's gonna fall apart,
then make a record.
And I was so glad that we did
because it turned out that,
like, everybody needed a good cry
as well as us.
It was funny because I... I feel like
you captured the spirit
of the whole record with that song.
With "the 1" in the sense
of just the way it opens, um,
"I'm doing good. I'm on some new shit.
Been saying 'yes' instead of 'no',"
and I was like, "Is she talking about
writing songs with me
and everything else at the same time
or something... "
I think it has a new...
I think it has a double meaning. The...
Opening the album with the words,
"I'm doing good. I'm on some new shit.
Been saying 'yes' instead of 'no'."
Um, it... it applies to the situation
that the song is written about where,
you know, you're updating a former lover
on what your life is like now
and trying to be positive about it.
But it was also where I am creatively,
where it's like, "I'm just saying yes.
I'm just putting out an album
in the worst time you could put one out.
I'm just making stuff with someone
who I've always wanted to make stuff with
as long as I've been
a fan of The National. And...
I'm just gonna say 'yes' to stuff."
-Yeah.
-And it worked out.
Beautiful.
- That was so fun.
- Yeah.
God. This is such a blast.
This is a real, real damn blast.
You know that?
- You know what this is? A real blast.
- Yeah, that was beautiful. Yeah.
When you sent me the track
for "last great american dynasty,"
I had been wanting to write a song
about Rebekah Harkness
since 2013, probably.
And I'd never figured out
the right way to do it
because there was never a track
that felt like it could,
kinda hold an entire story
of somebody's life and whatever
-and move between generations.
-Yeah.
Then when I heard that, I was like,
"My God. I think this is my opening.
I think this is my moment. I think I can
write the Rebekah Harkness story."
That song is such a folklore moment to me
because it's not about you,
but it is all about you.
-And it's like...
-Well, it's that country music,
kind of, narrative device
where in country music it's like...
Totally. Yeah, yeah. "And I was that man
that I've been talking about."
Yeah, "I was that kid."
Like... Which is the best.
You listen to country songs,
and you're just like, shivers, everywhere.
My whole body.
Even though it's not till the very end
when you spin it around,
even though
the story's about someone else,
I think it's the most revealing thing.
-I think it's... it's so deeply personal.
-Aw.
It really hits you in the gut
when you hear that at the end.
Thanks.
-It's real good.
-Man.
I only wish our other two co-writers
were here.
- Who?
- Justin Vernon and William Bowery.
Justin is, is, 
one of the greatest ever.
William, I never got to meet.
There's been a lot of discussion
about William Bowery and his identity
'cause... it's not a real person.
It's not?
Jack.
I'm doin' a bit.
A bit. That would've gone on forever.
What?
- Who?
- When?
So, William Bowery is Joe, as we know.
And Joe... Joe plays piano beautifully,
and he's always just playing
and making things up
and kind of creating things.
And "exile" was crazy
'cause Joe had written
that entire piano part, that...
And it was singing
the Bon Iver part. The...
Jesus.
-And I...
-Lyrics too?
-Yeah, he was just singing it...
-Jesus.
...the way that the whole first verse is.
- Wow.
- And so, I was entranced
and asked if, um, we could
keep writing that one.
It was pretty obvious
that it should be a duet
'cause he's got such a low voice
and it sounded really good
-sung down there and in that register.
-Yeah.
And then, um, we're really, really,
really big Bon Iver fans. And, you know.
-So cool.
-We know that Aaron knows him.
But we're... I...
I was too afraid to suggest it.
But, I just...
When I sent it to Aaron, I was like,
"This is, hopefully a duet.
We... I don't know who with.
Who would it be with?
Who do you think would be good with this?"
And Aaron was like,
"I think Justin would love this."
You're like,
"Okay, that could be interesting."
-I couldn't say it. I couldn't say it.
-Really? Is that really what happened?
No, I couldn't say it with words.
Because if I would have said it
and he would have gone to Justin,
and Justin would've said no,
it would've hurt too much.
Interesting.
When we talked about it, I was like,
"I think he's gonna be
really inspired by this."
And then we sent it to him, and he was.
And then the process of working on it
and what he sent back.
And he wrote...
Like, we didn't ask him to write anything,
-but he wrote this, like...
-Yeah. He wrote this amazing bridge.
He wrote...
...and like, that whole bit.
I kept thinking,
"This isn't really going to happen.
Like, Justin is going
to change his mind about this
because this isn't a part of my reality.
There's no way
that this is going to happen.
He's gonna record the vocals
and then decide
he doesn't want to be on the record."
And then, it just never...
That just never happened.
Like, he just is on the album,
and he's just the coolest,
and that's what's happening.
Where do we start?
I mean, to me the whole thing starts
with "my tears ricochet."
Yeah. Chronologically,
that's the first thing.
I wrote that one alone.
And it's definitely, I think,
one of the saddest songs on the album.
Yeah. I think it's one
of the best songs you've written.
Aw, thanks.
Which is I think why you crowned it
as a track five.
Yeah, picking a track five
is sort of a pressurized decision,
but I knew from day one
this was probably gonna be it.
-Um, it's kind of a song about karma.
-Yeah.
It's a song about greed.
It's a song about how somebody
could be your best friend
and your companion
and your most trusted person in your life
and then they could go
and become your worst enemy
who knows how to hurt you because
they were once your most trusted person.
-It's the worst betrayal.
-Yeah.
It does remind me
of people going through a divorce
and having that person
that they swore to be with forever
then become the person that they spend
most of their time talking shit about.
Yeah, and it is that ultimate betrayal
when someone,
you know, messed you up from the inside.
Writing this song,
it kind of occurred to me
that in all of the superhero stories,
the hero's greatest nemesis is the villain
that used to be his best friend.
-Yeah.
-Um, that sort of thing.
When you think about that, you think about
how there's this beautiful moment
in the beginning of a friendship
where these people have no idea
that one day they'll hate each other
and try to really take each other out.
-Yeah.
-I mean, that's really sad and terrible.
But that's the bird's eye view quality
of the song that I think is so unique
because they're both great, but sometimes
you write, like, very in the moment.
And you're like,
"This happened, and this is how I feel."
I love that, but this song,
which is interesting
that it's the first one that happened
because I think it became a huge theme
on the album, is it's very pulled back.
It's very pulled back and commenting
on the whole experience of it.
Um...
It's very powerful to me.
In folklore, there are a lot of songs that
reference each other or lyrical parallels,
and one of the ones that I like
is the entire song "this is me trying"
then being referenced again
in "mirrorball,"
which is, "I've never been a natural.
All I do is try."
Yeah, I remember that being an interesting
one for you to actually put down.
'Cause I remember you said it,
and you did it, and you were like,
-"Should I say that? Should I... "
-I was like, "Is that too true? Is that... "
And I think with "mirrorball," sometimes
when I'm writing to an instrumental track,
I'll push play,
and I'll immediately see a scene set.
And this was one of those cases
where I just saw, you know,
lonely disco ball,
twinkly lights, neon signs,
people drinking beer by the bar,
um, a couple of stragglers
on the dance floor.
Just sort of a sad, moonlit,
lonely experience
in the middle of a town
that you've never been.
And I just was thinking,
"Okay, so we have mirrorballs
in the middle of a dance floor
because they reflect light.
They are broken a million times,
and that's what makes them so shiny.
We have people like that in society too.
They hang there, and every time
they break, it entertains us."
-Yeah.
-And...
"And when you shine a light on them,
it's this glittering, fantastic thing,
but then a lot of the time
when the spotlight isn't on them
they're still there, up on a pedestal,
but nobody's watching them."
It's a myth we love,
and then we create it for people.
Yeah. It's the whole...
-Like, "Do the broken thing."
-Do the broken thing.
"Make it fun. Now make it sad.
Now make it cool. Now make it sad."
-Yeah, but when the light's off, be okay.
-Yeah.
It was a metaphor for celebrity,
but it's also a metaphor
for so many people
who have to feel, like...
Everybody else feels like
they have to be on for certain people.
For... You have to be different versions
of yourself for different people.
Different versions at work,
different versions around friends,
different versions of yourself
around different friends.
Different version of yourself
around family.
-Yeah.
-Everybody has to be duplicitous, um...
or feels that they have to,
in some ways, be duplicitous.
And that's part of the human experience,
but it's also exhausting.
And you kind of learn
that every one of us has the ability
to become a shape-shifter.
-Totally.
-But what does that do to us?
And it also is the first time,
and one of the only times,
that the time that we're living through
is actually lyrically addressed.
Um, I think that, you know,
the pandemic and lockdown and all that
runs through this album like a thread
because it's an album
that allows you to feel your feelings,
and it's a product of isolation.
It's a product of all this,
you know, rumination on
what we are as humans, blah, blah, blah.
But this is the first time
in the bridge saying,
"They called off the circus,
burned the disco down
when they sent home the horses
and the rodeo clowns."
I wrote this song right after
I found out all my shows were canceled.
And it's like I'm still on that tightrope.
I'm still trying everything to keep you...
to get you laughing at me.
So, it's like, I realize, here I am
writing all this music, still trying,
and I know I have an excuse to sit back
and not do something,
but I'm not, and I can't,
-and I don't know why that is.
-You don't get it.
But that's what makes it, to me,
a great piece of pandemic-time work,
is that it's not about the pandemic.
It's about the experience
of what happens to an artist
when you're living through a pandemic.
-Yeah. You start there... You start...
-You start to dream.
Yep.
With "seven," the song,
I was looking back on it.
I've always wondered...
When I see a kid throwing
a massive tantrum in a grocery store,
part of me is like, "Man, I feel you."
Like, "When did I stop doing that
when I was upset?"
Like, "When did I stop being so outraged
that I would throw myself on the floor
and throw the cereal at my mom?"
Well, it also doesn't stop,
but where does it go?
-Yeah.
-That feeling.
Like, we're still having that feeling,
but what is it now?
Yeah, so the idea is, you know,
please picture me before I learn civility.
Like, I used to scream anytime I wanted.
Obviously, you know, we can't be
throwing tantrums all the time,
and we learn that
that's not the right thing to do,
but there's something lost there too.
It's a weird experience,
to work with you.
And now Aaron can understand it.
No, I'm serious because it's like,
"Here's the song.
Wait, here's the bridge.
Wait, here's a better bridge.
Okay, now I have the perfect bridge.
Then here's a thing after the bridge,
and this thing's gonna come in... "
I wrote that in the vocal booth.
Yes! So there's series of...
And so... But hearing the patchwork
of that whole thing coming together,
I was just like, um...
I just love what you did on that song.
-It takes me away.
-Thanks. I love what you did on that song.
And I've been kinda in my head,
like, calling the girl from "august"
- either Augusta or Augustine.
- Nice.
-I've been naming her that in my head.
-Well, that changes things for me.
Cause she's really nameless to me,
but now it's forever changed.
What happened in my head was,
okay, so "cardigan"
is Betty's perspective from,
like, 20 to 30 years later,
looking back on this love
that was this tumultuous thing.
In my head, I think Betty and James
ended up together.
-Right?
-Interesting.
So, in my head, she ends up with him,
but he really put her through it.
But, like, "august" was obviously about
the girl that James had
this summer with, right?
So she seems like she's a bad girl,
but really, she's not a bad girl.
She's, like, really a sensitive person
who really fell for him.
And she was trying to seem cool
and seem like she didn't care
because that's what girls have to do.
And she was trying to let him think
that she didn't care,
but she really did, and she thought
they had something very real.
And then he goes back to Betty.
So the idea that there's some,
like, some bad, villain girl
in any type of situation who,
like, takes your man
is actually a total myth because
that's not usually the case at all.
Like, everybody has feelings
and wants to be seen and loved,
and just, like, Augustine,
that's all she wanted was love.
That's what I love about "august" is,
like, it's not a dream.
Even though it sort of sounds like it.
Like, it feels...
The situation feels very close to me.
-Like, getting swept up like that.
-Yeah.
That whole song started with the fact
that I had written down in my phone,
"Meet me behind the mall" years ago,
wanting to write it into a song.
I loved that.
I'd been thinking about addiction,
and I'd been thinking about people who,
if they're either suffering
through mental illness
or they're suffering through addiction
or they have an everyday struggle.
No one pats them on the back every day,
but every day
they are actively fighting something.
But there are so many days
that nobody gives them credit for that.
-Yeah.
-And so,
how often must somebody
who's in that sort of internal struggle
must wanna say to everyone in the room,
"You have no idea how close I am
to going back to a dark place,"
-or, "You have no idea."
-Yeah.
"You have no idea
how hard it is to get to the point
-where you guys think is still shitty."
-Yes.
Like, I think about that a lot. Like...
The idea of...
the idea of doing your best, or trying,
is one that only a person knows,
and you know when you're doing it.
And it's so hard,
which is what I get from that song,
when you're doing your damn best,
and it's not good enough.
-Yep.
-And it rarely is.
-Yeah.
-Um...
But it's, you know,
it's a very isolating feeling
which, I think, is funny
'cause it actually is
the thing that binds all of us.
Cause we're all doing our best and feeling
like it's not even close to good enough.
Yeah, I had this idea
that the first verse would be
about someone
who is in sort of a life crisis
and has just been trying and failing
and trying and failing
in their relationship,
has been messing things up
with the people they love,
has been letting everyone down,
and kind of has driven to this overlook,
this cliff,
and is just in the car going,
"I could, like...
I could do whatever I want in this moment,
and it could affect everything forever."
But this person backs up
and drives home, and...
Yeah, I love that. The idea that not
driving off the cliff is an act of trying.
Yeah.
Which is almost
the ultimate act of trying.
Yeah. And then
the second verse is about...
um, you know, someone who felt like
they had a lot of potential in their life.
I think there are a lot of mechanisms
for us in our school days,
in high school or college, to excel and
to be patted on the back for something.
And then I think a lot of people
get out of school
and there are less abilities
for them to get gold stars.
And then you have to make all these
decisions and pave your own way,
and there's no set class course
you can take, and there's...
And, I think a lot of people feel
really swept up in that.
And so I was thinking about this person
who is really lost in life
and then starts drinking
and every second is trying not to.
Yeah.
This was the first album
that I've ever let go of that need
to be 100% autobiographical
because I think I felt like
I needed to do that,
and I felt like fans needed to hear,
like, a stripped-from-the-headlines
account of my life.
And actually,
it ended up being a bit confining
because there's so much more
to writing songs
than just what you're feeling
in your singular story line.
And this was the first time
that I ever was like...
I think it was spurred on by the fact
that I was watching movies every day.
I was reading books every day.
I was thinking
about other people every day.
I was kind of outside
of my own personal stuff.
And so I ended up just, like...
I think that's been my favorite thing
about this album,
is that it's allowed to exist
on its own merit without it just being,
"People are listening to this
because it tells them something
that they could read in a tabloid."
Interesting.
It... It to me fees like... it feels like
a completely different experience.
So, "invisible string."
When I first heard
the track that you sent me,
I thought, "I have to write something
that matches it,"
and pretty quickly
I came upon the idea of fate.
'Cause sometimes I just,
you know, go into a rabbit hole
of thinking of how things happen,
and I kind of love the romantic idea
that every step you're taking,
you're taking one step closer
to where you're supposed to be.
You know, guided by this little,
like, invisible string.
I remember when I bought this
little guitar that has a rubber ridge,
which you have one now too,
but it has this like...
Yeah. You got me one and sent it to me,
and it was, like...
I couldn't believe opening up this,
like, beautiful...
Is it a '50s guitar?
-It is from the late '50s...
-Wow.
...and it's been, like,
renovated
so that the bridge deadens the strings,
and it sounds really old.
And it just really kind of
writes songs for you, in a way,
'cause it's so fun to play.
And that was the first one
that I wrote with it,
and then you wrote this incredible song
that is all about fate,
and that was another moment where
I just felt there was this serendipity...
happening between us and crazy chemistry.
As far as, like...
You took exactly what I had written,
and it was as though we wrote it together
in a room, or something.
I remembered I wrote it
right after I sent an ex a baby gift.
And I was just like, "Man, life is great."
And I just remember thinking this
is a full signifier that life is great.
"mad woman."
The first time I heard
that piano thing you had written,
I just felt like... It's got these
sort of ominous strings underneath it.
And I was like, "This is female rage."
Like, "This is a song about female rage.
It has to be."
Like, "I have to figure out
how to make this about female rage."
And then I was thinking...
the most rage-provoking element
of being a female
is the gaslighting that happens when,
you know, for centuries we've been
expected to absorb male behavior silently.
Right? Silent absorption
of whatever any guy decides to do.
And, oftentimes when we,
in our enlightened state
and our emboldened state, now,
respond to bad male behavior
or somebody just doing something
that was absolutely out of line,
and we respond,
that response is treated
like the offense itself.
Yeah.
You know, there's been situations with...
recently, with somebody
who's very guilty of this in my life,
and it's a person who makes me feel,
or tries to make me feel,
like I'm the offender
by having any kind of defense
to his offenses.
It's like, "I have absolutely no right
to respond or I'm crazy.
I have no right to respond or I'm angry.
I have no right to respond
or I'm out of line."
So you were providing the musical bed
for me to make that point
that I've been trying so hard
to figure out.
How do I say that...
How do I say why this feels so bad?
I think I really felt like there should be
a string moment on the album
because we were towards the end of it,
and it was all very piano and acoustic.
And you're so good
with string arrangements,
and, you know, Bryce is...
I mean, a genius.
And I kinda felt like
there should be a moment where
there's a song
that was unlike anything I'd done before
and could really exercise that muscle
that I know that you have.
And I couldn't... When I heard it,
I remember thinking,
"Maybe I wanna tell a sports story."
'Cause I had just watched
The Last Dance, and I was...
and I was thinking all in terms of sports
and winners and underdogs
and things like that, but actually,
what I had been doing really frequently
up until that point was I had been doing
a lot of research on my grandfather
who fought in World War II at Guadalcanal.
Which was an extremely bloody battle,
and, you know, he never talked about it.
Not with his sons, not with his wife.
Nobody got to hear
about what happened there.
And so, my dad had to do
a lot of research,
and he and his brothers
did a lot of digging
and found out that my granddad was exposed
-to some of the worst situations...
-Fighting, yeah.
...you could ever imagine
as a human being.
And so, I kind of tried to imagine
what would happen
in order to make you just never
be able to speak about something.
When I was thinking about that,
I realized that...
that there are people, right now,
you know,
taking a twenty-minute break
in between shifts at a hospital,
who are having this kind
of trauma happen to them right now,
that they will probably
never want to speak about.
You know?
And so, I just kind of thought, like,
this is an opportunity
to maybe tell that story.
The way you weave that together,
where there's remembrance
and bearing witness
to your family's history,
but then recognition
of who the heroes are today.
It's so moving. And I tried...
The sense of harmony in that song
is really different than other songs.
And again, it was as though
we did it in the same room
-and worked out the chords and everything.
-Yeah.
And how you sing to it
feels different than any other song.
It was another moment where it just felt
like I was just thankful to be a musician.
Or like, "This is why I play music."
You know, something like...
Yeah, I felt that way with this song too,
where it was just like, "How did this
slot into place and come together?"
I often feel with this album,
there have been times in my life where
things have fallen apart so methodically,
um, and I couldn't control
how things were going wrong,
and nothing I did stopped it.
And I felt like I'd just just been
pushed out of a plane
and was, like,
scratching at the air on the way down,
and I felt like the universe
is just doing its thing.
It's just dismantling my life,
and there's nothing I can do.
And this is a weird situation where ever
since I started making music with you,
I felt like that was the universe forcing
things to fall into place perfectly,
-and there was nothing I could do.
-Yeah.
It's one of those weird things
that makes you think about life a lot,
where this lockdown could've been a time
where I absolutely lost my mind,
and instead I think this album was
a real floatation device for both of us.
One of my favorite things
about this record is the fact that
there's this trilogy of three.
The trinity of "betty," "august"
and "cardigan" are all, like...
We made "august" together.
We made "cardigan" together.
- We all three made "betty" together.
- It's perfect.
And "betty" was... I just heard Joe singing
the entire fully formed chorus of "betty"
from another room.
Yeah.
And I just was like, "Hello."
You're like, "I do this professionally."
-Hello.
-"I'd love to have a conversation."
It was a step that
we would never have taken
because why would we have
ever written a song together?
I thought you were doing a bit when
you were like, "Joe and I wrote a song."
Then I was like, "What?"
I thought it was gonna be, like,
you know, people write cute songs
about their animals, in relationships.
And then you're like,
"No, no, we wrote a real song"
and I was like, "What?"
Then you sent it to me, I was like...
So this was the first time
we had a conversation,
where I came in and I was like, "Hey,
this could be really weird,
and we could hate this,
so because we're in quarantine
and there's nothing else going on,
could we just try to see what it's like
if we write this song together?"
So, he was singing the chorus of it,
and I thought it sounded really good
from a man's voice,
from a masculine perspective.
And I really liked that
it seems to be an apology.
And I've written so many songs
from a female's perspective
of wanting a male apology
that we decided to make it
from a teenage boy's perspective
apologizing after he loses
the love of his life
because he's been foolish.
Allegedly.
No, he's been foolish.
No, according to the Internet,
we don't know what it's about.
-He's been foolish.
-No, I mean...
We wrote it. I'm confirming.
He's been foolish. He was a fool.
I don't know who William Bowery is,
so yeah, okay.
With the song "peace,"
when you sent me this instrumental,
the first word that I thought of
was this is what peace sounds like.
It's got this, you know,
this amazing bass line
that just made me feel like,
"This is serenity. This is peace."
And then I was thinking,
maybe you just start with the obvious
and think about how that could be told
in an interesting way
that kind of goes against the title.
Like, "I could never give you peace,"
over the most peaceful sounding
instrumental track.
Yeah. That's why I sent it to you
'cause you kinda said,
"Send me everything, including
the most off-the-wall idea you have,"
um, and then you were able
to write a song,
which, not only does it, like,
have such a beautiful...
It's just such a beautiful love song
in recognition of the kind of, like...
insecurity in any relationship
that, like, "Will this actually...
Will I be able to give you peace?
Will you be at rest with me,
even though, you know, whatever comes?"
-Yeah.
-Um, but you also trace the bridge.
When I heard the bridge,
and that you traced all the weird timing
and weird chord changes,
it just felt like,
"Okay, we can do anything.
We might be able to do anything,"
or something. You know, this is a...
Like, it pushed the collaboration forward
at that moment.
Where I was like, "Okay, so this
is a weird race. Let's just... "
Yeah. I think this is a song
that's extremely personal to me
because there are times when I feel like,
with everything that's in my control,
I can make myself seem like someone
who doesn't have an abnormal life.
And I try that every day.
Every day it's like,
"How do I make myself,
among my friends and family
and my loved ones,
not see this big elephant
that's in the room for a normal life?"
Because I don't want
the elephant in the room.
-Yeah.
-You know?
If you're gonna be in my life,
I feel like there's a certain amount
that comes with it
that I can't stop from happening.
I can't stop from you getting a call
in the morning that says, you know,
the tabloids are writing this today.
I can't help it if there's a guy
with a long lens camera
two miles away with a telescope lens
taking pictures of you.
I can't stop those things from happening.
And so, this song was basically,
like, is it enough?
Is the stuff that I can control enough
to sort of block out
the things that I can't?
-Yeah.
-Um...
So, it makes me really, like,
really emotional to hear this song
and to know
that a lot of people related to it
who aren't talking about the same things
that I'm talking about.
They're talking about human complexity.
Yeah. I love that about the record
in general and this song specifically.
'Cause to me, it's about...
I have, in my life,
suffered from depression,
and I'm a hard person
to be in a relationship with
or be married to because I go up and down.
And I can't help it. It's a chemical thing
that happens sometimes.
And music is a way
of dealing with that for me.
Um, and just somehow the song captures
the fragility of what that's like
to be in a relationship with someone
who may or may not have peace
or may...
But that's, again, my interpretation.
And someone who
you would wanna provide with peace.
-Yeah.
-You know, someone that you love,
so you want them to have
as much peace in their life as possible
and reconciling the fact that you might
not be their best option for that,
-but is it still a deal they wanna take?
-Yeah.
Okay, the word hoax
is another word that I love
'cause I love that it has an "x,"
and I love the way that it looks,
and I love the way it sounds.
I think with this song being
the last song on the album,
it kind of embodied all the things
that this album was thematically.
Like confessions, um,
incorporating nature,
emotional volatility
and ambiguity at the same time,
sort of love that isn't just easy.
And it's the most symbolic, poetic thing
listing all these things
that this person is to you.
And I remember I asked you
for advice on this one.
You did. I think you didn't... I think...
Like, to you it meant different things,
and that was a moment
of, like, doubt or something.
And I said... I think I said,
"What if not all of these feelings
are about the same person?
What if I'm writing about several
different, very fractured situations?"
Like, one is about love,
and one is about a business thing
that really hurt,
and one is about a sort of relationship
that I consider to be family,
but that really hurt.
Yeah, and I remember...
-This is one of the moments...
-You referenced Matt.
Yeah. When Matt, you know,
The National and Matt Berninger...
Often songs are about more than one thing
or many sides of a coin.
And I just love that,
and I kind of thought,
"This is... This feels different,
and it also feels... "
Um, I kinda like the fact
that you weren't totally sure.
I definitely had the moment of doubt.
I had the moment of like,
"I don't usually do this.
I usually know exactly
what I'm writing about."
Um, and I was really happy when
you kinda pushed me forward like,
"Nope, do the thing
that makes you uncomfortable."
Because I think that's what makes it
a song that really, to me, stands out.
That line about, "you know it still hurts
underneath my scars
from when they pulled me apart."
Anyone in my life knows
-what I'm singing about there, but it...
-"But what you did was just as dark."
Everybody has that situation in their life
where it's, like, you let someone in
and they get to know you,
and they know exactly what buttons
to push to hurt you the most.
Yeah.
That thing where the scar healed over,
but it's still painful.
They still have phantom pain.
Yeah.
I think the part
that sounds like love to me is,
"Don't want no other
shade of blue but you.
No other sadness in the world would do."
It sounds like... To me,
that sounds like what love really is.
Like, "Who would you be sad with?
And who would you deal with
when they were sad?"
And like, "Gray skies every day
for months, would you still stay?"
Yeah.
One, two. One...
I think "the lakes" sort of sounds
like a testament
of what I've wanted to escape from
and where I saw myself escaping.
Um, we'd gone to the Lake District
in England, a couple years ago.
What is the Lake District?
It's in England, and, you know,
in the 19th century,
you had a lot of poets
like William Wordsworth,
and John Keats would spend
a lot of time there.
There was a poet district,
these artists that moved there,
and they were kind of heckled for it
and made fun of for it
as being these eccentrics
and these kind of odd, um, odd artists
who decided that
they just wanted to live there.
And I remembered when we went, I thought,
"Man, I could see this.
You know, you live in a cottage,
and you've got wisteria growing up
the outside of it,
and you just...
Of course they escaped like that.
Of course they would do that."
And they had their own community of
other artists who had done the same thing.
And then, I've always, in my career,
since I was probably about 20,
written about this sort of
cottage backup plan that I have.
-You've been writing about that forever.
-I've been writing about it forever.
You've been writing about
getting out forever.
Yeah. So "the lakes"
is really talking a lot about
relating to people who,
hundreds of years ago,
had the same exit plan and did it.
And they went and did it.
I went to William Wordsworth's grave
and just sat there, and I was like,
"Wow, you went and did it."
-Yeah.
-"You just did it.
You just went away, and you kept writing,
but you didn't subscribe to the things
that were killing you."
You left those things behind
in a real way.
And that's really
the overarching thing that I felt
when I was writing folklore is,
I may not be able to go
to the Lakes right now,
or to go anywhere,
but I'm going there in my head,
-and this escape plan is working.
-Well, you have your version of it.
That, to me, is the hope
in this body of work is that
it's not, "I can't do this. I'm out."
It's, "I've found something
worth escaping with."
-And a person to escape with.
-And a person.
And, to me, that's a huge,
sincere statement of hope
that everything I'm naming
is completely small compared to this love.
Yeah, it's the perfect...
I thought it would be the perfect way
to slot the last puzzle piece in,
right when people least expected it.
Yeah.
Um, because "hoax" as the ending song
for the record,
I thought was interesting
for a couple weeks,
but then I wanted to actually come in
with the real last song of the record,
which is this song that... "the lakes,"
which shows you exactly what...
It kinda is the overarching theme
of the whole album,
of trying to escape,
having something you wanna protect,
trying to protect your own sanity,
and saying, "Look, they did this
hundreds of years ago.
I'm not the first person
who's felt this way. They did this."
It's a really potent statement right now.
I think the idea of getting away
and figuring out
how to remove the things
that are not working in one's life
is the story of this time.
-Yeah.
-If you're not thinking about that,
I don't know what you're thinking about.
That oughta do it.
Beautiful.
Whiskey?
This way to the whiskey.
So the record was recorded here,
my studio, and your house.
Yes.
Did you give it a name?
Yes. Think it's called
Kitty Committee Studios on the album?
It works.
It does, 'cause I've got cats fighting
in the background, on the bed.
There was a big cat vibe, yeah.
And then the cats were the only people...
- Laura kept getting cats.
- The cats were going in and out
because if I were to close the door
on them,
- they'd meow.
- Yeah.
So they need to be able
to be free-range cats.
- Yes.
- Yeah, cage-free.
Guys. Stop it. Stop. Stop!
Benjamin always starts it,
and Olivia always finishes it.
He's twice her size,
but she's an amazing fighter. Look at her.
It's usually Benjamin and Olivia
that have lots of...
I call them the marshmallow wars.
No one's gonna get hurt,
but there's a lot of...
There's a lot of this.
It was bizarre.
It really was bizarre,
but it was, at the same time,
my favorite recording experience.
Yeah. I mean, it's just a very cool way
to have made an album.
Yeah, it really is.
