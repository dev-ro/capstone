(Solemn instrumental
music continues playing)
Hilary: Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you. Merry Christmas.
Neil: And I'm not talkin'
about a new pair of trousers.
An old pair, just lyin' there.
Janine: Oh, yeah.
See, I used to do that.
When my mum wouldn't let me wear
my miniskirt out of the house.
I just got changed
in the back row.
Neil: Also, used nappy.
Popcorn bucket
with vomit inside.
Janine: Ugh.
Yeah. Whole cooked
chicken in a safeway bag.
How about you, hils?
What's the worst
thing you've found?
Anything interesting?
Um, dead body.
Had a heart attack during
smokey and the bandit.
Took three people to move him.
Bloody hell.
Well, that's killed the mood.
(Laughs)
(Both laugh) What the fuck?
Blimey!
(Chuckles softly)
(Soft instrumental music
playing)
(Indistinct chatter, laughter)
(Seabirds cawing in distance)
(Spits)
(Places toothbrush)
(Heavy breathing)
(Opens lid) (Pills rattling)
(Choral music playing
faintly on speakers)
(Music stops)
Laird: Headaches? Nausea?
No.
Laird: Sleeping all right?
Yes.
Good.
Shall we weigh you?
Laird: Mmm.
Not ideal.
Four pounds heavier.
How do you feel, generally?
Fine.
Laird: Do you feel better
since leaving St. Jude's?
Yes.
Any big mood swings?
No, not really.
Good.
Stable.
That's good.
(Laird humming tune)
I do feel a bit...
Laird: Hmm?
Numb, I suppose.
Well, I'm sure that'll wear off
as soon as you get
used to the lithium.
It's marvelous stuff.
And you do have people
you could talk to, I assume?
Family, friends?
Oh, yes.
(Jersey bounce
by Benny Goodman playing)
Hilary, do you have a partner?
Yes. No, I don't think so.
Excellent. This is bill.
Bill, this is hilary.
How do you do? Nice to meet you.
Apologies in advance.
(Jersey bounce continues)
Neil: I mean,
it's so depressing.
He's just dronin' on and on.
You wake me up when it's over.
Janine: Oh, piss off!
(Singing)
No, don't!
You're gonna break
it. (Neil whimpering)
No, don't! You're
gonna break it.
Neil: Janine!
Stop the... (Yelps)
(Laughter)
God, you're a tosser.
I am a tosser, but I did try.
Yeah. Yeah, whatever.
Listen, come back,
supertramp, all is forgiven!
(Singing)
(Neil scatting) (Laughter)
(Continues singing)
What on earth is going on?
Sorry, Mr. Ellis,
Janine was playing us
something on her walkman.
Ellis: Well, you
can all calm down.
Janine, if you're
at a loose end,
perhaps you'd like to
come and do tickets for us?
Trevor hasn't shown
up again, so we're short.
Janine: But it's my lunch break.
It doesn't look like you
were eating much lunch.
Well, yeah, 'cause I
haven't had the chance yet.
My heart bleeds. Outside.
(Janine sighs)
Hilary, perhaps you
and I could discuss
that whole Trevor
situation in my office?
Ten minutes.
Yes, of course.
(Ellis breathing heavily)
Ellis: Suck me. Hilary: No.
Please. Suck me off.
Hilary: No, let's just keep...
(Both breathing heavily)
Just like this.
Like this.
(Door closing)
(You're blase by Ella
Fitzgerald playing softly)
(Indistinct chatter)
(Door opens)
Waiter: Good evening,
sir. How can I help you?
Ellis: Table for two, please.
(Door closes)
Waiter: Can I take your coat?
Thank you.
Waiter: May I take
your order, madam?
Oh, I'm not sure... (Hesitates)
You know, I've just realized,
I'm really late
for an appointment.
I'm terribly sorry.
(Vehicles passing outside)
So, Stephen here
will be replacing Trevor,
who was never here anyway.
So, he's already off to
a flying start. (Chuckles)
Anyway, this is Neil, who
does box office mostly.
Nice to meet you. Hiya.
Norman, our projectionist.
All right? Hello.
And Janine, who'll be
collecting tickets with you.
Watch out for her
strange musical tastes.
(Chuckles) It can't
be worse than mine.
(Giggles) Hiya. Stephen: Hi.
Ellis: Frankie, Brian
and Finn with the...
Hair.
Both: Hello. Stephen: Hey.
And our esteemed
duty manager, hilary.
She also does sweets and snacks.
Hello. Hello.
So, I'll leave you all
to get better acquainted.
Hilary will show you the ropes.
Make sure you take
the packet from the front
otherwise it never gets
sold then it gets dusty.
Okay.
(Exhales) That smell
must make you hungry.
You're never tempted
to sneak a handful?
No.
I didn't mean to
steal it, I just meant...
Try to keep a tab
of the items you sell
and then make sure you replace
them at the end of your shift.
This is screen one.
Wicked. Hilary: Mmm.
You'll have to do final cleanup
if you're on late shift.
Make sure to check for sleepers.
(Chuckles) Really? Yes.
One chap used to
bring in an air mattress.
(Both chuckle)
Projection booth.
Don't go in. Norman's
very particular.
You stand at the
bottom of these stairs.
And, make sure you keep
hold of the ticket stubs,
then bring them back to me
so I can check them
against admissions.
Okay. So, when do we,
you know, open up?
Erm...
Twenty minutes.
What's up there?
Public aren't allowed.
Can I have a look?
Oh, I'm not sure. Go on.
Please.
Stephen: Oh, my god.
It's a whole other cinema.
Hilary: Used to be four screens.
Hilary: Screen three.
Screen four.
(Door opens)
Best for last.
(Captivating music playing)
(Pigeons fluttering)
Wow.
(Fluttering continues)
Stephen: What a place.
Hilary: It really was beautiful.
It still is.
Another world.
(Pigeon cooing)
Look at this little fellow.
It's all right.
(Grunts softly)
It's all right. It's all
right. (Shushing)
(Pigeon continues cooing)
I think he's broken his wing.
(Sighs) He needs a bit of help.
Hilary: I don't
think he likes it.
Stephen: It's okay, he's fine.
Aren't you?
Here, hold him.
Oh, no, no. I don't like birds.
Oh, come on. Look.
Come on.
Go like this.
(Hilary gasps) Oh.
There you go.
He loves it.
Look, he prefers you.
(Chuckles softly)
Now...
What're you doing?
Special trick.
You okay?
Yeah.
(Chuckles softly)
You ready?
Hold him still.
Yes. Hilary: Oh.
(Chuckles)
Good boy.
You can put him down now.
(Both chuckle)
What happens
when he needs the loo?
(Both chuckle)
Norman: Nine across.
Five letters.
Word that starts a waste land.
April.
Oh. (Chuckles)
Morning, hils. Morning.
Norman.
Got your glad rags for tonight?
Yes. And I brought
those in for later.
Ooh, I say!
So, we could go down
misty's off tivoli road,
if we can get in.
Or that club,
Hades, at the lido...
Hello. Has got a good dj.
Yeah, maybe, yeah.
Neil: What's all that?
It's my stingy brim.
My three-button tonic
for tonight.
Neil: Didn't have you
down as a rude boy.
What you goin' on about?
Rude boy, you know? Two tone.
Norman: Who-tone?
Stephen: Two tone.
The specials, the
selecter, the beat.
I don't understand a single word
you're sayin'. (Stephen laughs)
It is a bit like reggae,
but dance music.
It's like fast reggae.
Always fancied one of these.
Yeah, you've got
the reggae ska side,
and then you've got
the punk side.
You know, black
and white together.
It's a melting pot. Janine: Mmm.
God help us.
Stephen: What about you, hilary?
Gonna come dance with us?
Oh, no, I shouldn't think so.
It's not really my thing.
Discotheques. Bloody nightmare.
So, what're you gonna do?
Um, I dunno, I thought
I might go onto the roof,
watch the fireworks.
Nice.
Where's all your mates, anyway?
Buggered off to college.
Ah, that's where I'm goin'.
Norman: Good luck
with that. (Janine laughs)
Stephen: Well, off we go, then.
Another day,
another four pounds fifty.
Oh, god. Oh, my god.
He is such a much of a hunk.
Now that is on the cards.
(Clears throat) Screen
one, top of the stairs. Enjoy.
Janine: Upstairs,
screen one. Okay?
Thank you. Enjoy the film.
I'm looking forward to it.
(Janine laughing)
Yes, sir.
That's the 8 o'clock
up and runnin'.
So, what time
are you clocking off?
Where are the ticket stubs?
I gave 'em to Janine.
Where's Janine?
Shit. I think she went early.
You had one thing I
asked you to do. One thing.
Yeah, I know, but I
thought that I could...
(Angrily) It's completely
unacceptable!
All right, there's no need to...
It's unprofessional!
Impersonating the customers,
laughing behind their backs!
People come here
for a nice time,
not to be laughed at!
Yeah, you're right.
I'm sorry.
Good.
Just don't laugh at people.
(Indistinct chatter)
(Door opens)
Hilary, when you're done later,
why don't you pop into
the office for a quick drink?
Oh, I don't know. No, come on.
Just for a few minutes.
Toast the new year.
All right. That would be nice.
No invite for me, I see.
Hilary: I can't. (Ellis grunts)
Stop.
Why?
Who's this hurting?
Well, your wife, for one.
She has no idea.
Doesn't mean it's right.
Brenda doesn't know me anymore.
We've been sleeping
in different rooms
since the summer.
She won't even
make me a cup of tea.
You're the most
wonderful person.
You're so helpful.
I feel such
tenderness towards you.
Your arse feels so
good in my hands.
(Ellis breathing heavily)
(Ellis moans)
Here's to 1981.
God, lovely stuff, that.
Glenfiddich.
Hilary: Mmm.
So, any new year's resolutions?
No, not really.
Um, try to eat
a bit better, maybe.
I was thinking perhaps I'd...
I'd like to expand
this place a bit.
Put it on the map.
Can I let you in on a secret?
You mustn't tell anyone. What?
It looks like
we might be getting
a big south coast premiere.
Mayor, councilors...
Herald, the lot.
Gosh.
Well, that would be wonderful.
Ellis: Oh, I know.
Chariots of fire.
That's the film.
It was between us and the odeon,
but they didn't want
a circuit cinema.
So, it looks like
we've got the nod.
So, we'll have to
spruce the place up a bit.
Who knows?
Might be the beginning
of an exciting new chapter.
(Car honking in distance)
(Knocks at door) Jesus!
Hello?
It's me, Stephen.
(Car horn blaring)
Come in.
I was just leaving.
I wanted to apologize
for earlier.
Oh, really, it's fine.
I'm sorry I shouted.
Why didn't you go with Janine?
I did, for a bit.
But I don't know
any of her mates,
and people,
you know, staring. So...
How awful to feel watched.
Yeah, sometimes.
Anyway, I thought you
might want company.
On the roof.
Oh, I'd almost
forgotten about that.
Yeah, okay. Why not?
(Sentimental music playing)
(Stephen gasps)
Stephen: Oh,
wow. This is so cool.
(Chuckles) Look at that.
If I had some binoculars
I could almost see my mum.
Is that where you live?
Yeah. (Cork pops)
(Drink pouring)
Do you always come up
here on new year's Eve?
Last couple of years.
I don't blame you.
Here. Not exactly moet,
but it's better than tizer.
Thank you.
I'm sorry it's just us.
No, this is nice.
I'm not really a fan of
new year's Eve, anyway.
Last year,
I puked on my new shoes.
Oh, no! What happened to them?
(Chuckles)
They survived. (Hilary laughs)
Cheers. Cheers.
Oh, come on! Get it down ya!
Oh, no. I shouldn't.
I've had too much already.
Really? When?
Come on.
What are you,
a woman or a wouse?
What's that?
9 to 5.
You know, 9 to 5,
the film we're showing.
(Whispers) Oh.
Honestly, anyone would think
you worked in a bank, hilary.
Why don't you
sneak in and watch?
Oh, no, no,
that's for the customers.
And it gets so busy out front,
there's always so much to do.
Oh, god, listen to
me, I'm so boring.
Honestly. (Laughs)
(Bells tolling in distance)
Oh, listen.
(Bells continue tolling)
"Ring out, wild bells,
to the wild sky...
"The flying cloud
and the frosty light.
"The year is dying in the night.
"Ring out, wild
bells, and let him die."
Nice.
Tennyson.
People: (In distance) Ten, nine.
Hilary: Eight.
(Along with people)
Seven, six...
Five, four...
Three, two, one!
People: Happy new
year! Happy new year!
(People cheering)
(Fireworks bursting)
(Fireworks continue bursting)
Shit.
Hilary, it's all right!
(Sentimental music playing)
(Music continues)
(Imperceptible)
(Imperceptible)
(Music continues)
(Imperceptible)
Why not?
Because it's pointless.
They turned me
down the first time.
To study what?
Architecture.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Yeah.
You have to try again.
Yeah, maybe.
Well, you can't just give up.
Stephen?
Don't let them tell you
what you can or can't do.
No one's gonna give you
the life you want.
You have to go out and get it.
You can't stay here.
All right.
Man: Oi!
Oi! Where you from?
Man 2: Where you goin', son?
Man 1: Well, they
have fuckin' bananas
where you come from, did they?
Why don't you fuck off back home
where you came from, yeah?
You fuckin' chimp.
Yeah, go home, fuckin' coon.
We don't like wogs 'round here.
Taking our jobs.
Go, then. Fuck off!
(Men laughing and jeering)
(Men hooting mockingly)
Man 2: Go home, fucking coon.
Norman: I told
management months ago.
There should be a no-smoking
rule in both auditoria.
Smoke compromises
the viewing experience.
Ruins the projected image,
and it stains the screen.
Simple common sense.
All I'm saying is
you need a basic understanding
of optical and
mechanical principles.
To be in this game.
Like I keep telling Ellis,
any old numpty
could sell tickets.
Ellis: Morning.
Morning, Mr. Ellis.
Morning, Norman. Morning, all.
Hilary, can you
pop in for a minute?
Nope.
I'm sorry? No, I can't.
I'm running late.
I need to open up.
Suit yourself.
I was going to ask you
to work late tonight.
Brenda and I have an engagement.
So, I'll need
to be gone by 5:00.
Sorry.
Stephen: Screen two.
Go on upstairs. Enjoy the film.
Hello.
I think our little friend
might need a visit.
It'll cheer him up.
(Seagulls calling)
Stephen: Nearly ready.
Open the window. (Pigeon cooing)
Look at that.
Good as new.
Amazing.
Yeah.
Time to say goodbye.
Bye.
(Hilary gasps softly)
Stephen: There he goes.
To be able to fly.
Yeah.
(Soft music playing)
(Breathing heavily)
Stephen: Trinidad, originally.
They brought my
mum over in the '60s
to train as a nurse.
Apparently, they
needed more workers.
"Help rebuild
the mother country,
"make your fortune."
(Chuckles)
She's still here, still a nurse.
That explains the pigeon splint.
(Stephen chuckles)
You got me.
And here was me
thinking you were Jesus.
(Both chuckle)
What about your dad?
He was a bus driver.
But he left years ago.
Where to?
I dunno.
Gosh. How did you feel?
Fine.
It's always been
just me and my mum.
She's the best.
Wish I could say
the same for mine.
Was that... You know?
Was it okay?
Yeah.
It was more than okay.
(Chuckles softly)
Shit.
What time is it?
Neil: Where have you been?
Ellis left 20 minutes ago,
he said you were covering.
I'm so sorry, Neil.
I've had to keep them
all waiting outside!
And where's Stephen?
I don't know. Is he not here?
Stephen: Sorry!
Hilary: So sorry!
Thank you very much.
Sorry to keep you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much.
Hello, there. Sorry to keep you.

I'm so sorry, sir.
You have to finish
those out here,
you can't bring them in.
Why not?
Because those are the rules.
It's my breakfast.
I know, but you've got
a couple of minutes
before the film starts.
I'll miss
the comin' attractions.
Well, it's up to you.
(Scoffs)
Are you fuckin' serious?
Yes.
Are you gonna stand there
and let me be bossed
around by this...?
By this...
What?
By this what?
Okay, now, Mr. Cooper.
You haven't got
many chips left, look.
You could eat a few and
then give the rest to me.
I like a chip.
(Gulping)
Happy now?
So sorry.
Sorry, Stephen, he's
always a bit of a handful.
He's a dickhead.
You okay?
Stephen? Stephen?
Stephen?
(Horn blares)
It's no point walking out.
There's every fuckin' point.
He's just an angry man.
He's always angry
about something.
Look, hilary, I know
you're trying to help,
but you're just makin' it worse.
How am I making it worse?
By pretending it isn't there.
I really don't know
what you're talking about.
All right, put it this way.
He's not just "angry," is he?
And he should be
the one to leave.
Not me.
You're absolutely
right, Stephen.
I'm sorry.
Really.
Okay, this might be the moment
to demonstrate
my greatest talent.
Hilary: Does it happen a lot?
Yeah, more than it used to.
Especially the last few months.
Really?
Well, yeah.
It's everywhere, isn't it?
Is it?
Yes, it is.
All that stuff in Brixton.
And the skinheads.
And Thatcher.
And those kids in new cross.
What was new cross?
Couple of weeks ago,
at this girl's
16th birthday party
someone started a fire.
No one came for them.
You should read
the newspapers, hilary.
It's not goin' away.
Told you, you need
to hold it sideways.
Yeah, not bad.
Still some training needed.
Look, watch this. Okay?
(Hilary chuckles)
I lied. I'm shit
at it. (Chuckles)
Kiss me.
No one's looking.
(Sentimental music playing)
Four canisters at a time,
'cause they're not light.
And lift 'em carefully.
Precious cargo.
(Norman grunts)
Put 'em down there.
Tea? Please.
You can go in if you want.
(Spoon clanking softly)
(Spoon clatters)
These are my babies.
Pair of model 18 kalees.
I had no idea they'd be so big.
Well, that's just
as it should be.
You don't want people to know.
They should just see
a beam of light.
But back here...
It's belts, straps,
pulleys, intermittents...
Sprockets.
Complex machinery.
And what's this?
That's the carbons.
Spark between the
carbons makes the light.
And nothing happens
without light.
Ciggy?
No, thanks.
Amazin'.
It is amazing.
Because it's just static frames,
with darkness in between.
But there's a little flaw
in your optic nerve
so that if I run the film
at 24 frames per second,
you don't see the darkness.
(Chuckles) Wow.
It's called the phi phenomenon.
Viewing static images
rapidly in succession
creates an illusion of motion.
Illusion of life.
Ellis: So, on top of
the lobby needing
a lick of paint
and all the rest,
we're going to need
special signage,
a red carpet,
crash barriers for the crowds.
And I believe
the mayor's office will
provide some security. Jim?
Yes, yes, indeed.
There will be
a small security detail.
And you can expect
the mayor, of course
and his entourage,
which is not insubstantial.
And we're waiting
for confirmation,
but guests look to
include dora Bryan,
sir Laurence Olivier,
Steve ovett,
dame flora Robson,
dusty Springfield
and possibly, Paul
McCartney. (Hilary gasps softly)
Goodness. Mmm. Yes, I know.
Lives in rye. Hmm.
Two pounds down
since last time. Well done.
Well, I've been trying to
take a bit more exercise,
eating better, you know.
And the lithium? How's that?
Good.
Last time you said
that it made you feel
a little out of sorts.
Yes, it's much better now.
I think my system must
be getting used to it.
Really?
Yeah, much better.
Excellent.
(Hilary humming)
(Do nothing
by the specials playing)
What're you doing?
No one's watchin' you!
Shut up, look the other way.
Why? I've seen it all.
Don't be vulgar.
It's different in the
throes of passion.
Well, I can't be bothered.
I am going...
What're you doing?
(Gasps) (Stephen laughs)
Hilary: No! (Laughs)
Stephen: Charge!
(Laughing)
(Hilary gasps, laughs)
(Do nothing continues playing)
(Seagulls calling)
Hilary: Where did you meet her?
Stephen: She was one of
the nurses on my mum's ward.
Hilary: She your first
serious girlfriend?
Yeah.
Broke my heart.
Cried for a week.
I still can't go
near the hospital
without getting butterflies.
Goodness.
Yeah, I just couldn't stop
thinkin' about her, you know?
What about you?
Oh, nothing as grand as that.
There must have been someone.
Hilary?
Mind your own business.
Okay.
That one's different
to the others.
I wasn't aware I was
working under instruction.
I'm just saying.
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.
Why you doing that?
You're spoilin' it.
I am not working
under instruction.
All right, fine.
Do what you want.
I shall. Thank you.
God, you men, you
always have to help us.
Always have to instruct us.
Don't be silly.
Got your hands
around our fucking throats
and you won't let go.
(Angrily) Got your hands
around our fucking necks
and we can't breathe.
But you won't let go, will you?
You won't fucking well let go!
Why don't you just... Hilary!
Fucking let go? Stop.
What're you doin'?
(Panting)
You won't fucking
well let go, will you?
(Breathing heavily)
(Grunts)
(Breathing heavily)
(Somber music playing)
Are you sure you'll
be okay getting home?
Yeah.
You? Oh, I'll be fine.
I'm in early tomorrow
to open up.
Maybe see you then?
(Hilary breathing heavily)
(Seagulls calling)
Neil: Morning.
Morning.
Listen...
Hilary, I know it's
none of my business,
but perhaps it might be better
to leave your
personal life at home.
What?
Rather than upstairs, in the,
you know...
In the pigeon Coop.
I don't know what you mean.
Oh, come on.
Look, be careful.
Hils, remember
what happened before.
Just look after yourself.
I don't know how he
knew, he just knew.
I think he might have seen us
coming downstairs
together the other day.
It's fine. We just need
to be more discreet.
Perhaps just meet
outside of work?
Look,
maybe it's not a good idea.
What do you mean?
Well, this.
The whole thing.
Why?
Well, once people
know it, it's different.
Really?
Yeah, it's just...
It feels different.
You're embarrassed. No, I'm not.
And that's not,
that's not what I'm saying.
Yes, you are, you're
embarrassed. I just don't...
Of course you are. It's silly.
It's ridiculous.
What were we thinking?
I'm not embarrassed, hilary.
I just don't think
we can do this.
No, you're absolutely right.
I'll see you soon. (Kisses)
(Sighs)
(Bolt unlatches)
(Sobbing)
(Old rock music
playing on speakers)
Have either of you
two seen the keys
to the utility cupboard?
Oh, I dunno.
I think hilary had them.
Oh.
There you go. Thanks.
Neil: You heard from hilary?
No.
It's been three days.
She told Mr. Ellis
she was taking
some overdue holiday.
I'm sure it's all fine.
So why am I worried?
She had a rough time last year.
She had to go away for
a while in the summer.
Why?
I think things just got
a bit much for her.
She ended up being rude
to a couple of the customers.
Shouting at them.
She was staying later
and later at work.
Said she couldn't sleep.
And started doing weird...
Things.
Eventually, Ellis told us
she had to go into hospital.
She was away for a few weeks
and when she got back
she was different.
How?
Just quieter.
A bit sad.
Did you speak to her about it?
She didn't wanna talk.

(Indistinct chatter)
Janine: Enjoy.
Uh, hi!
(Indistinct chatter continues)
Janine: Enjoy.
Hilary: My dear young man!
Don't you look
absolutely glorious!
Hilary! Hi.
Yes, I know,
I don't have a ticket.
But it's all right, I work here.
I taught him
everything he knows.
Hello!
Darling!
(Applause)
Ellis: My worshipful lord
mayor and lady mayoress,
councilor rushworth,
councilor booth.
My lords, ladies and
gentlemen, good evening.
My name is Donald Ellis.
I am the manager
of the empire cinema,
perhaps the south coast's
premier film venue.
It is a great honor...
Perhaps the greatest
of my career
to welcome you to this,
the regional gala
premiere of chariots of fire.
(Applause)
Uh, there are a few people
I need to thank.
Uh, the mayor's office,
obviously.
(Whispers) Where's the mayor?
Ellis: And in particular,
Jim booth for his help...
(Whispers) There.
Next to Ellis' wife.
(Mouthing)
Ellis: And his sage advice.
And all the staff here.
Uh, hilary's here.
Ellis: At the empire,
for their hard work
and dedication.
What? Where?
Ellis: And lastly...
Somewhere in the building.
Ellis: My wife, Brenda...
Is she all right?
Ellis: Whose unstinted
support and love...
I'm not sure.
Have been unwavering.
And so, without further ado...
I am delighted to welcome you
to Hugh Hudson's stirring
and altogether terrific...
Chariots of fire.
(Applause)
Ellis: What're you doing?
Oh, no.
(Applause)
Good evening, my lords,
ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Mayor.
My name is hilary small.
I am duty manager
here at the empire.
And as such, I thought I'd
add a few words of welcome.
Tonight is a special night.
More than ever,
we need to be...
We need to feel
part of a community.
Black or white,
it doesn't matter.
It's a very important thing.
We must celebrate.
(Mic feedback whines)
So, to Mark the occasion,
I'd like to read a poem
I think would be appropriate.
It's by w. H. Auden.
"The desires of the heart
are as crooked as corkscrews.
"Not to be born
is the best for man...
"The second best
is a formal order...
"The dance's pattern.
"Dance while you can.
"Dance, dance,
for the figure is easy...
"The tune is catching
and will not stop.
"Dance till the stars
come down from the rafters.
"Dance, dance,
dance till you drop."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hilary!
What the hell do you
think you're doing?
You were not invited to speak.
Well, it can't be
all men droning on.
You knew what this
evening meant to me, hilary.
You more than anyone.
And yet you willfully
tried to ruin it.
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
but you can't always
have it your own way!
Well, you've got a
problem. You know that?
You need serious help.
Now, we've all tried
to help you here,
but at some point you need
to take responsibility
for your own...
And why don't you go
and fuck yourself!
Donald?
What're you doing?
Why aren't you inside?
The film's started.
Oh, hello, Brenda.
I've been wanting to meet.
I think about you daily.
Brenda: I don't understand.
Well, so many
questions for a start.
And so many notes to compare.
I'm still unclear.
Mostly about your
husband's sexual tastes.
Hilary, for god's sake.
What do you mean?
Ellis: Brenda, this is nonsense.
Don't listen to a word she says.
"To fuck or not to fuck,
that is the question.
"Whether 'tis nobler
in the minds
"to wank him off
into his teacup,
"or let him fuck me
over his desk
"and spoil all his paperwork?"
Is this true?
Donald, is this true?
Neil: Yes.
Yes, it's true.
(Norman sighs)
Well, first reel's
goin' off beautifully.
What the hell are you doing?
Telling the truth.
What a novel idea!
That's not the truth.
I'll tell you the truth.
You're a schizophrenic.
You're a fucking nutter!
And the only reason
you're working here
is because
I told the social workers
I'd keep an eye on you.
You're unemployable.
If you want to find the condoms,
they are in the top
left-hand drawer of his desk,
next to the Murray mints.
Right, so, what're we gonna do?
Well, Ellis says he doesn't
want her back at work.
Apparently, she'd already
threatened to smash
all his windows
with a golf club.
What? Is that really true?
I wouldn't put it past her.
He's called the social services.
They'll probably take
her back into hospital.
Well, how come
he gets away with it?
It just seems so unfair.
Look, she's probably
better off in St. Jude's.
How can she be better off
in a mental hospital?
They know how to deal with it.
No.
What are you doing?
Well, I'm going to see her.
I don't think
that's a good idea.
I'm not sure how
much help you can be.
Well, I can't just
turn my back on her.
Leave her on her own.
I can't.
Hilary!
(Seagulls calling in distance)
(Doorbell buzzing)
(Door buzzes open)
What do you want?
I'm worried about you.
Well, that's terribly sweet,
but I don't need your concern.
I thought you might want
company, someone to talk to.
I'm absolutely fine!
Jesus Christ, what is
wrong with you people?
All right, all right.
But I just need to say this.
What you're going through
is a medical condition,
it's an illness.
And I wanted to make
sure that you understand
that it's not your fault.
(Laughing)
Did you take a guide book
out of the library for me?
Oh, dear.
What's so funny?
You don't have to try so hard.
(Laughs, kisses)
Just pour me a glass of wine.
(The wind by cat
Stevens playing softly)
Hilary: And they said,
"no, you can't go in there.
"You're not allowed."
So, I sat there
like a good little girl
with my schoolbag at my feet.
And I waited.
And I knew it as soon as my
father stepped into the room,
I could smell the sex on them.
Such a fucking cliche!
Sex with the secretary.
I think my mother knew.
She kept asking me
but I told her nothing.
Why not?
Because I was loyal
to him. I've no idea why.
And then she started
punishing me.
She blamed me for my father
withdrawing his affections.
Because I was
"daddy's little girl."
And when I had my first period,
she brought the bedsheets
to the breakfast table.
And said,
"look what your precious
"little girl just did!"
Jesus.
I used to sit in the back of
the car on the way to school
and I'd look at the
back of her neck.
I'd just stare at it and think
all I have to do is just
put my hands round there
and just squeeze!
(Laughs)
Look at your little face!
You think I'm mad, don't you?
But I am absolutely sane.
This has all been planned.
I've been lying in wait
for them all this time.
All these people, all these men,
they will have their
comeuppance, just you see!
You have had your day,
Mr. Donald Ellis!
Professor Raymond pattenden,
how dare you give me
a low second,
you corrupt little shit!
Dr. Ian laird,
you are a fucking fraud!
And I shall report you
to the highest medical
authority in the land!
You are finished!
I will finish you!
Because I'm the only one
who knows the truth,
do you understand me?
I'm the only one!
(Knock on door)
(Morning has broken
by cat Stevens plays)
Bramah: Hello? Miss small?
Quick, turn the lights off.
(Light switch clicks)
Don't speak. Don't make a sound.
(Knocking on door)
Bramah: Miss small?
It's constable bramah
from the Kent police again.
We've got
social services with us.
Could you let us in, please?
(Whispers) Just
ignore them. Bastards.
Bramah: Miss small?
We've received
further complaints
from other tenants
in the building
about loud music
and a general disturbance.
There's also reports
from Mrs. Van dyck
in flat seven
that you've made
several very serious
verbal and physical
threats towards her.
(Whispers) Bitch.
Bramah: I'm gonna need
you to open this door, please.
(Whispers) Just stay
quiet. They'll go away.
Rosemary: Miss small?
Hilary?
It's Rosemary bates here,
Kent social services.
We've met before.
Hilary, could I come in, please?
(Whispers) Go now.
Out the back.
What?
Leave. Now.
The fire escape.
Why, hilary?
I just wanna help.
You don't get it, do you?
I don't want your fucking help!
I am not your patient.
I am not some problem
to be solved.
Rosemary: Hilary, I'm afraid
if you don't open the door,
we are going to
have to force entry.
Go now.
(Angrily) Do I
make myself clear?
Do I?
Yes.
Good.
Then fuck off.
(Door thuds loudly) Shit.
Rosemary: Hilary,
please open the door.
(Door thuds loudly)
Oh, for goodness sake!
Just go in there
and close the door.
(Door thuds loudly)
(Door thuds loudly)
Rosemary: Hilary,
please open the door.
(Door thuds loudly)
Hilary, we're asking
you one last time.
Please, open the door.
(Morning has broken
by cat Stevens continues)
(Door thuds loudly)
(Song ends)
May we come in?
Hello, hilary.
It looks like things have got
a little bit out of hand again.
Is that right?
You're all packed?
That's good.
A good few days' sleep
and you'll be
feeling much better.
We've got a first floor room
all nice and ready for you.
This one's got
a view of the garden.
(Mellow music playing)
And two girls.
Romping through the desert,
splashing into the ocean.
Listen for the reel end bell.
(Bell ringing) Open the dowser.
Here comes the first blob.
And do motor cue.
After the water,
we go on the sand.
Here comes second blob.
California, here I come!
Go!
Yes!
(Laughs)
Norman: Excellent. (Chuckles)
Now, get that one off,
lace up reel three.
And don't dick about.
Stephen, can you
do the inventory
and then you can
clock off early?
Yeah, of course.
Great.
(Thunder rumbling)
Reporter: (On TV)
More than a hundred
white and colored youths
fought a pitched battle
against the police.
Some were as young as 12,
the oldest no more than 20.
It lasted for eight hours.
And at the end of it,
merseyside's chief constable
said it was a planned attack.
"We were set up," he said.
The worst of the rioting
came just after dawn
when police faced a hail of
stones, bottles, iron bars...
I'm feeling very hot
with answers like that.
And now, I gave
a very respectable one.
(Audience laughing on TV)
That'd be one pound ten, please.
Thank you.
Stephen?
Ruby.
Wow. Hi.
Hi. I didn't know
you worked here.
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, five months now.
I thought you wanted
to go to university.
Yeah, well, I tried.
Still trying.
I'm not at the hospital anymore.
Your mum probably told you.
No, she didn't say anything.
(Whispers) It was
the hours. (Laughs)
Those early mornings.
I don't know how they do it.
Yeah, I know.
Uh, so, what do you do now?
Well, for the time bein'
I'm working
at that bar on
the front. Boodles.
Mmm. It's fun.
You should pop in.
Maybe have a drink.
Yeah. Might do that.
And in the meantime,
a box of maltesers,
please. (Chuckling)
Oh. Right, yeah, of course.
Twenty p.
Thank you.
Uh, enjoy stir crazy.
It's brilliant.
Thanks.
See you soon, then?
Yeah, see you soon.
(Mellow music playing)
(Ruby giggling)
Stephen: It's fine.
Like this. Okay?
(Mellow music continues playing)
(Ruby laughing)
Did it.
(Both laughing)
Ruby: So, what're you gonna do?
Stephen: I don't know.
Maybe stay here, keep
working at the empire.
Help Norman out.
Who?
Oh, the projectionist.
He is funny.
And you know what?
I like it up there...
Once you get over the smell.
(Laughing)
Yeah, that's cool. All
those movies for free.
Well, you don't really
get to watch any of them.
Why not?
What is it?
Stephen: Nothing.
Someone I know.
Ruby: Do you want to say hello?
No, it's fine.
(Stephen sighs)
You okay?
Stevie?
What?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You know what?
I do feel a bit...
I think I should go
back and say hello.
Um, okay.
I'll be quick.
Hilary.
Hello.
How're you?
I'm good.
So, you're back.
Yes.
Out and about again.
That's good.
It's great to see you.
We've missed you.
(Chuckles)
I'm sure that's not true.
You should drop by
and say hello to everyone.
Mr. Ellis has left.
He moved to Brighton.
Yes, Neil told me.
He called me and asked me back.
Wow. That's brilliant.
Hello.
Hi. Hilary, this is Ruby.
Ruby, this is hilary
who I know from work.
So, hopefully, see you soon?
Yes.
Thank you. Thanks.
(Coins clatter)
Thank you.
Stephen: Hilary?
Hilary?
Hilary, are you all right?
Stephen.
Tell me truthfully,
did I humiliate myself?
What?
Tell me. Did I?
(Sighs)
No. It wasn't humiliating.
It was just...
Intense.
To be honest,
I thought you
were a bit of a hero.
(Chuckling)
That's very nice of you.
Hard to believe.
My dad used to take me
fishing when I was little.
We never caught any fish.
And for years, I just thought
he was a bad fisherman.
And then, I realized
it was something else.
Something quite simple.
He didn't know
where the fish were.
And he was too ashamed to ask.
He was just ashamed.
Shame is not
a healthy condition.
You should try
to forget about it.
Go in there more often.
No, I can't. It's my job.
Yeah, you tear the tickets.
Make sure they're
all in their seats.
But you never go in.
You should watch
once in a while.
Yeah, sit in the middle
of a bunch of people
who don't know you,
who've never met you,
who can't even see you.
(Sighs)
That little beam of light
is escape.
I've missed you.
Come on.
We've got a little
surprise for you.
(All cheering)
Thank goodness you're here
because I need
some of this cake!
(All cheering) Ta-da!
Janine: Safeway's finest!
(Indistinct chatter)
Employee: That one.
(Spellbound by siouxsie and
the banshees plays on speaker)
Janine, I've gotta admit.
This song is growin' on me.
Yeah, it's good.
(Rumbling in distance)
What's that?
Stephen: You played it for me.
U.S. spin magazine.
You hear that?
Janine, can you
turn that down some?
(Lowers volume)
What's that noise?
(Engines revving outside)
Wow!
Look at that.
Rioter: Leave our jobs alone!
Come on, skinheads!
Rioter 2: Leave our jobs alone!
Colored scum! Off our streets!
Okay, right, lock the doors.
(Tense music playing)
(Latches locking)
Rioter: White is right!
(Rioters continue shouting)
(Laughing) Hello, Princess.
What we doing?
Look who it is, boys!
Let me in!
(Rioters shouting indistinctly)
Oh, my god!
(Shouting continues)
Hello, Princess!
Where you fucking going?
Come on, you fuckin' wog!
Come on then, you
bunch of fucking cowards.
Rioter: What did you
fuckin' say? Huh?
Look at you, you can't
do anything on your own.
I ain't a coward,
you fuckin' spade!
Use your imagination,
you fucking coward!
(Stephen groans)
(Tense music continues playing)
(Imperceptible)
No! Stop it!
(Shouting continues)
(Police siren wailing)
Rioter: Get off of me!
What the fuck?
Get the fuck off of me!
(Crying)
(Siren blaring)
(Stephen breathing heavily)
You're going to be all right.
You're strong.
(Gasps softly)
Doctor: What's happened?
Paramedic: He's had a kicking.
Gcs had dropped to six,
and he just lost consciousness.
Doctor: Coming through.
Excuse me, please!
Paramedic: Respiration's
at 35 per minute.
Doctor: Move, please!
Let's get him
straight into resus.
Are you next of kin?
No, he's my friend,
I work with him.
Next of kin only
past this point.
But will he be all right?
If you wanna wait here,
we'll let you know.
Delia: Excuse me.
Are you waiting
for news of Stephen?
Yes.
He's going to be all right.
(Sighs) Thank god.
Badly bruised all over.
And he's lost
a couple of teeth...
But he's conscious.
And he wanted you to
know that he was okay.
Oh, that's...
Thank you.
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
It's a bad situation.
Anyway, you can go home now.
You must've been
waiting here for hours.
Yeah. I'll just get my things.
Are you the one that he
went to the beach with?
Yes.
Yes, we did go to the beach.
(Sighs)
(Shower running)
(Melancholy music playing)
Announcer: (On TV)
Now the time is almost
six-and-a-half minutes past 12
and BBC one is closing down.
So, from all of us here,
this is Henry Brooks
wishing you a very good night.
I have to say,
I miss our young friend.
I was getting used
to having someone
to help me with all this. Hmm.
You been to visit him?
Couple of weeks ago.
Not since?
No.
Go and see him.
Don't run away.
Is that what I'm doing?
Seems like it.
What're you
frightened of, hilary?
(Sighs)
I've got a son.
Christopher.
He's 22 now.
Lives in London.
I haven't seen him
since he was eight.
What?
Doesn't want to see me.
I don't blame him.
Basically, I ran away.
Why?
What?
Why?
(Laughing) I can't remember.
(Chuckles)
(Mellow music playing)
Hi. Can I go to ward one?
Thank you.
Thank you.
A couple of cracked ribs.
So, it's a bit sore
when I laugh.
But the swelling's gone down.
My eyesight's okay. So...
I'm so sorry, Stephen.
I don't know what to say.
There's nothing to say.
It's happened to my mum,
it's happened to me,
it'll probably happen
to my children.
Sometimes I think...
What's the fucking point?
Here. I got you something.
It just came out.
I thought you might like it.
Oh, my god.
The chap in the shop
gave me a funny look.
But then, I suppose, I don't
look much like a "rude girl."
(Laughs, groans)
Sorry. (Groans)
That's so nice of you.
I didn't really get
what was so special
about it all before.
But, black kids and white
kids meeting up together
makes it all normal.
Yeah.
Good music, too.
Delia: Hello.
It's okay, you don't
need to leave.
I'm just doing last check-ups.
Oh, no, I should go.
I've got stuff to do,
and it's getting late.
I don't want to be a bother.
Bye, then.
Bye, hilary.
Thanks for coming.
Bye.
Hilary.
Look, hilary,
I don't know what's gone
on between you two...
And I don't really want to.
But you should know that
he was askin' after you.
He likes you.
You cheer him up.
So...
(Sentimental music playing)
Empire cinema
on the front, please.
(Engine starts)
Show me a film.
What?
Show me a film.
I want to see a film.
What film?
Any film.
You choose.
(Reel whirring)
(Inaudible)
(Sentimental music
continues playing)
Chance: I see.
That's a very small room.
Wilson: (Chuckles) yes,
sir. I guess that's true.
Smallest room in the house.
Chance: Yes,
I guess that's true.
I feel very good in here.
Rand: (Laughs)
That's the oxygen.
Chance: As long as the
roots are not severed,
all is well.
And all will be well
in the garden.
(Crying softly)
President "Bobby": Life...
Is a state of mind.
(Sniffles)
(Switch clicks)
It was just wonderful.
I can't wait to see it again.
Yeah.
Peter sellers is the funniest.
You should see him in
return of the pink panther.
(Mimics inspector clouseau)
"I did not know
"the bank was being robbed."
Hilarious. I can't wait.
And there are so many others.
I'm gonna need you
to make me a list.
Of course...
Look...
I was thinking we could
make it a weekly thing,
midnight screenings.
I'm sure we could
persuade Norman...
I've got a place at college.
I'm going to college.
I got a letter two weeks ago.
A place opened up.
Well, that's wonderful! Where?
Bristol.
Architecture.
You did it.
(Sentimental music playing)
You told me not to give up.
Well, Stephen, congratulations.
You deserve it.
(Sighs)
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.
Ah.
(Door opens)
What did you get?
New shoes. Mmm-hmm.
And those books for the course.
That's great.
Did you tell her?
Yeah.
Was she okay?
Yeah.
No.
I don't know. (Sighs)
Well...
As long as you were kind.
Now, Ruby is comin'
for your goodbye dinner.
What are we gonna make her?
(All laughing)
No, no, no.
Don't break the glass, Stevie.
Those are the good ones.
All right, mum. Calm down.
I'll be gone tomorrow.
So here's to the future.
Aw. (Chuckles)
And to good music. Ruby: Mmm.
And to getting back up.
And here's to Richard
pryor and John belushi...
And Mars bars...
And sandcastles...
And my new suede shoes.
Delia: Mmm.
And here's to going away.
And coming home.
And now I need to pee.
(Ruby laughing)
God, Mrs. Murray.
He's so different from before.
Mmm-hmm.
He's lived a little
bit of life, I think.
(Clicks tongue)
A little bit of life.
Hilary: Here.
Read it later.
Thanks, hilary.
You're going to have
a wonderful time.
But I am going to miss you.
Yeah.
I'll miss you, too.
Okay. Off you go.
Okay.
So, I'll see you
in the holidays maybe.
Yeah. That'd be lovely.
Okay...
Bye.
Bye.
Stephen!
(Sentimental music playing)
(Conductor blows whistle)
Hilary: "The trees
are coming into leaf
"like something
almost being said.
"The recent buds
relax and spread.
"Their greenness
is a kind of grief.
"Is it that they are born again
"and we grow old?
"No, they die, too.
"Their yearly trick
of looking new
"is written down
in rings of grain.
"Yet still the UN-resting
castles thresh...
"In full-grown thickness
every may.
"Last year is dead,
they seem to say.
"Begin afresh...
"Afresh...
"Afresh."
(Sentimental music
continues playing)
