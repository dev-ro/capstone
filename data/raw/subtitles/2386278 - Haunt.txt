- Hello.
ls anybody-is anybody here?
Katie? Hilary?
Matthew?
Oh, kids, if you can hear me...
just know that l'm sorry!
l'm so sorry!
- Daddy?
- Daddy? Daddy?
l'm here!
- Daddy, be quiet.
l can hear you!
- Daddy, l'm here! l'm here!
- Dad, no!
- Matthew, is that you?
- Daddy?
- She's coming.
- Dad!
She's coming closer, Daddy.
- l don't understand!
- She's getting closer.
Daddy?
- Dad.
- l don't understand you!
- She's coming closer!
- Daddy?
- She's here. She's here.
- She's here.
She's here.
She's here.
l'm sorry.
Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Matthew!
- So you want
to hear a ghost story?
Well, every ghost story
begins With a house...
and a tragedy.
And so We begin With mine.
Moving into that house
Was supposed to be
a neW beginning
for me, Franklin,
and the kids.
l Was a pediatrician,
Franklin, a dentist.
We even built
our practices there.
But after it started
to happen...
- Business dropped off.
After all, What good's
a pediatrician
Who can't keep
her own babies alive?
- 911.
What's your emergency?
- Oh, my God!
- What just happened?
Tell me what happened.
- Headstrong MattheW...
little Hilary...
and our free spirit,
Kate.
Call it a wretched twist
of fate.
Call it the Wrath of God.
l don't care What you name it.
All l know is,
it took them.
lt took each
and every one of them.
People around here
had a name for it.
They called it
''The Morello Curse. ''
l heard them whispering
after Hilary Went.
But by the time Franklin took
his tumble and left me alone,
the whispers stopped.
The silence had a voice,
and it said,
''There but for the grace
of God go l. ''
-  KRB 94.1
- Current weather for the region
looking like snow.
- Oan somebody please
change the station?
- Yeah, we're not gonna pick up
much out here, honey.
- Dad, seriously.
Where is this place?
- He's lost.
- l am not lost.
- Honey, you're lost.
- No, l'm just trying-
- You're lost.
Admit it.
- l'm just trying to find
the turnoff where we have to go.
- He's lost.
- Yep, l'm lost.
Wait.
l actually think
this is it right here.
- And you must be the Ashers.
l'm glad you could make it.
lt's nice to finally meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?
- Good.
You're gonna love the place.
Oome on in.
Go ahead and show
yourselves around.
- Evan?
So what do you think?
- Of the attic?
No.
Of the house.
- lt's big.
- Yeah.
There's a pool out back.
l mean, it's kind of shabby,
but it's pretty nice.
- lt's a little creepy,
though.
- just needs some moving into.
You know, there's
a master bedroom downstairs
with a sick bathroom
and a balcony.
So l highly doubt Mom and Dad
will be considering this room,
which means it's up for grabs.
- Shouldn't l be the one getting
something in exchange
for all this
getting uprooted business?
l mean, you can
come and go as you please.
l, on the other hand,
am stuck here.
- Oh, poor Evan.
Has to live in a big house
with a pool in the backyard.
You could have
some seriously big
game-changing parties here,
little brother.
Shit!
- What?
- What kind of people
leave something like that
just sitting there?
- Jeez.
Looks like that kid who died
in that car accident.
- You know what?
You can have it.
- Take your time,
talk it over,
and l'll be waiting
right outside.
- Yeah.
- So what do we think?
- lt's pretty great.
- But...
- lt's kind of creepy.
- You're just thinking too much
about the last family.
- What happened
to the last family?
- Nothing. They just-
They had to move out.
- l mean, the place
needs some fixing up,
and, yeah,
there's some weird stuff.
But l like it.
- l love it.
So you think we can live here?
- Yeah.
l guess we could.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Let's see.
- This could be
in the dining room.
- Oh, l like this one.
- l love it.
- Yeah.
ls that her?
- ls that who?
Oh, yeah.
That's her.
l wonder what she's doing here.
We should go say hi.
- Oh, l don't want any
of her iuiu rubbing off on me.
- Alan.
All right, tough guy.
l, for one, am immune to iuiu.
- Uh-huh, sure, you are.
Famous last words.
- Shh.
Dr. Morello?
- Mrs. Asher?
- Oh, call me Emily.
- Of course.
Oall me ianet.
l don't want to intrude.
lt's just that
l left something behind.
Do you mind?
- No, of course not.
Do you know where it is?
- l do.
Thank you, Emily.
- Thanks.
- Can l help you?
- Oh, hello there.
l'm Dr. Morello.
l used to live here.
- Oh, hi.
- l remembered
l left something here.
l don't want it
to get thrown away.
- The portrait?
- My son's portrait.
You didn't throw it away,
did you?
- No.
No, of-of course not.
Good.
There you are.
Right where you left him.
- How old are you?
18?
Yeah.
He was your age when he died.
This is his room.
Thank you.
- Bye.
- Did you find
what you were looking for?
- Yes.
- Good. Good.
- l apologize.
- For what?
- lf l seem sullen.
- Oh, don't be silly.
These transitions can be hard.
- l've had a hard time,
Emily.
- l know.
- Hey, Mom!
The closet door's locked.
Do you have the key to open it?
- One second, Sarah!
l'm so sorry.
Those kids,
they're really spoiled.
- l say go ahead
and spoil them.
- lt's too late
for anything else, l think.
Well, it was nice
to officially meet you.
- The pleasure was mine.
You're very kind, Emily.
Now, you go spoil
those kids of yours.
- Okay. l will.
- Okay. Dig in.
- Oh, wait.
Hold on. Hold on.
l-l'd like to propose
a toast.
At times like these,
l think it's important
to stop and look around
and appreciate
how lucky we are.
l can't think of anything better
than-than being with my family
on a beautiful night
in the first week
of our new house!
- Hear! Hear!
- Oheers!
- Oheers!
- Oheers!
Oh, yeah. just like l...
Did you order the pizza
with everything?
- Where do you think
you're going?
- Don't touch me!
- Think you can just run
out of here like your mother?
Dad, no!
- l think he's having
some problems, Ron.
l don't know what,
if it's a hit selection
or what, but...
- He knows he's ready.
The 3-and-2 pitch...
- You know, look.
Do l think he's, like,
a troubled teenager?
No.
But l think this move
is good for him.
- Because...
- Because as hard as it seems
for him right now,
long-term,
l just think it's...
l just think it's best.
lt's hard for him.
- Now, l know he had to leave
his friends.
l know that was hard.
- Mm-hmm.
- But maybe a fresh start
will be-
will be good for him.
- Hey.
Where are you off to?
- l'm going for a walk.
- You okay?
Yeah, l'm fine.
- You all right?
- Hey, l'm-l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to scare you.
- Who are you?
- Evan.
l'm Evan.
- What are you doing here?
- l live in that house.
We just moved in.
- That's the Morello house.
lt's cursed.
- Oh.
Great.
- l...have been
in that house.
- Yeah, well,
now l live there.
- l'm Sam.
- Why are you crying, Sam?
- lt's none of your business.
- Are you okay?
- l don't like that question.
- Why?
- Because it's empty.
lt's rhetorical.
Does it really make a difference
if l say yes or no?
- Well, it might.
- How so?
- Because if-if you need help,
maybe l can help you.
- You know what you are?
You're a romantic.
You stumble upon a girl
crying in the woods,
and now you want
to rescue her.
- Do you need rescuing?
- No.
l don't.
Thanks
but no, thanks.
- Okay.
- Hey, wait.
Thanks.
Really?
Mom?
Dad?
ls anyone home?
- No! No!
No! Leave me alone!
No! No!
Stop! No!
No!
- We'll see, when they
come begging me
to let them in down here.
- That's important,
isn't it?
- What?
- To be right,
everybody else to be wrong.
- What do you mean by that?
Anita.
Anita?
- Get out, Dad! Get out!
- Where were you last night?
- Nowhere! l was nowhere!
- Where were you last night?
- Get out of my room!
How did you get in here?
- l told you.
l've been in this house before.
- Are you freaked out?
- No.
- Do you want me to go?
Okay.
- What can l do?
Protect me.
- l will.
- You promise?
- l-l promise.
- Do you gobble up
all your fingers?
- You have got yourself
one healthy baby.
Everything's tip-top.
- What about all the crying?
- Oh, that's just
her teeth coming in.
Perfectly normal.
Get some teething gel
from the pharmacy.
- Well, thank you,
Dr. Morello.
- You're welcome.
- Hmm.
- Once she gets her teeth,
you must bring her
to see my husband.
- How's his office coming along?
- Oh, just getting started,
but it won't be long.
Pretty soon,
we'll be a one-stop shop.
- That's great.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Oh, hush. Hush.
- Who are you?
- l'm Sam.
Who are you?
- Anita.
- lt's nice to meet you,
Anita.
- Nice to meet you.
Anita?
- Oh, Mom wants you.
Okay.
- Everyone,
this is Sam.
Sam, this is everyone.
- lt's nice to meet you,
everyone.
- Evan didn't tell me
he was having a friend over.
- No, l'm really sorry.
l meant to be out early.
l should probably go.
- Nice to meet you, Sam.
- Likewise.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Yeah, l got
to get going too.
l got to do rounds
at the hospital.
Let's talk about that later?
- Yeah.
- Hmm.
See you, girls.
- See you, dad.
- Bye.
- So who is she?
- l don't really know.
- How did you meet?
- When l went out walking.
She was out walking too.
She-she's just going through
some stuff at home
and needed a place to stay.
- Do you think that's what the
bruises on her arms were about?
You know what l love about you?
You're kind.
And clearly she has issues.
Just be careful.
- Yeah, l will.
- Bang!
You're dead.
God damn it.
- Ah, see?
That shit makes you paranoid.
- What?
- l'm not really sure
what to make of you.
- You can make
whatever you want of me.
You feel like sharing?
Do you like me?
- l think so.
- Don't be a coward.
Either you like me,
or you don't.
So which is it?
- Yes.
- Yes, what?
- l like you.
- Good.
l like you too.
lsn't there something
about dark waters
that just gives you the creeps?
You know, it's like,
even in pools,
l'm just sitting there
waiting for something
to come up and bite me.
You ever gone swimming
in the ocean at night?
- No.
- That's creepy.
Floating there with your-
with your head above water
and the rest of you
submerged in blackness.
You have no idea
what's under you.
Things that are bigger
and more dangerous
than you'll ever be.
And you're in their territory.
Does that sound weird?
- No.
Well, l think everyone gets
a rise out of tempting fate.
That's the whole point.
- Hmm.
Do you want to try something
with me?
- Shh!
Everybody's sleeping.
- Come with me.
You know what this is?
- No.
- lt talks to the dead.
The Morellos left it here,
and l found it.
- Does it work?
- l don't know.
l've never tried it.
- Why not?
- Guess l was waiting for
the right person to try it with.
- You curious?
- Have you seen these?
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's the Morellos.
See?
lf we talk to anyone,
it'd be them.
- You ready?
ls anyone here?
- Shh!
- Sorry.
- ls anyone in here?
- Well, l guess
it's just not meant to be.
Come on, let's get out of here.
lt creeps me out.
My room. My room.
Stay. Stay out.
- Did you say that?
- No.
Sam, be serious.
- l'm being serious.
l'm being serious.
Hey, what happened?
- lt worked.
- Well, yeah, it worked.
That's kind of the whole point.
- No, the point
is to want it to work
and then go, ''Oh, shucks,''
when it doesn't.
- Well, that seems
kind of pointless.
Hey, are you okay?
- Okay.
What just happened in there
could mean one of two things.
One, a ghost, a literal ghost,
just talked with us,
or two,
our subconscious
wanted it to happen so badly
that we manifested it
with some hidden, messed-up part
of ourselves.
What?
- l think you need
to see something.
Get your coat.
l think there's a memorial stone
out here...
somewhere.
Hang on.
l think it's over here.
- Shit.
lt's all the kids' stuff,
a whole pile of it.
What would it be doing out here?
- Morello went insane.
Hey, come here.
- Matthew Morello?
- l think
that's who talked to us.
Hey.
l'm going.
- Going where?
- Home.
- What's waiting for you there?
- lt's none of your business.
- What if l wanted
to make it my business?
- And how do you suppose
you do that?
You gonna come over
and beat up my drunk dad?
lf...
if l stay with you...
tonight...
would l be causing trouble?
- Besides, l don't really want
to be alone tonight.
- Yeah.
Neither do l.
My mother left
when l was just a baby,
and my dad hated her for it.
And l guess l did too.
l've just always been drawn
to this place.
lt's like something's
pulling me here.
Are you scared?
l don't know.
Are you?
- No.
- Why not?
- Because l...
l want it to be true.
- Why?
- Because if there's ghosts,
then maybe there's a heaven.
- Are you okay, Sam?
- l don't know.
- Thanks.
l appreciate it.
- Don't go thanking me yet.
l'm gonna make myself
a bowl of cereal,
think about all the shit
l'm about to give you.
- Oh, l'm so excited
for when it gets warm.
Yeah.
l can go swimming
every single day.
Oh, it's not dangerous.
You're being silly.
l'm a really, really,
really good swimmer,
so it'll all be okay.
Oh, yeah. Me too.
But why would we leave?
Well, l like it here.
- Anita?
- Yeah?
- ls everything okay?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Don't-don't say that.
You're-you're just trying
to scare me.
- Hi.
- Morning.
These are for you.
l don't know.
lf l imagined it,
then Sam imagined it too.
But we were kind of stoned,
so...
- Oh.
- Morning.
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad.
- Well...
maybe you two were having
some kind of shared
lovers' hallucination thing?
You know,
a little adventure,
dash of danger.
lt really happened,
didn't it?
lt really happened.
Coming to this house
was a bad idea.
- Don't say that.
- Why not?
- 'Cause it means a lot
to Mom and Dad.
- You know,
people who believe
in this sort of thing
always talk about opening doors
and inviting things through.
l know it sounds hokey,
but l think it's best if we
don't go testing the theory.
Samantha.
Samantha!

- Hey.
- No! Get off me!
Get off me!
- Hey!
Shh! Shh! Shh!
lt's okay. Shh. Shh.
- lt's okay.
- My name.
She said my name.
- Do you want to talk about it?
- l doubt it, Mom.
- Well, maybe she does.
We're a family that talks,
so if you would like
to talk about it, then-
- l was just spooked.
l-l'm sorry.
l don't know why.
- Yes, you do.
- Sarah.
- l'm sorry, but if this
is really happening,
we need to talk about it.
- What's really happening?
Evan, what is Sarah
talking about?
We tried to do
a kind of sance.
- Sance?
Okay.
- And it worked.
- lt did?
- Yeah.
- That must have been scary.
Yeah.
- l'm sorry, Dad.
l don't think
this is very funny.
- You're not telling me
you believe this, do you?
- Maybe l'm imagining the fact
that we're kind of
living in a house
that a lot of people think
is haunted.
- Sarah, don't let
the communal superstition
color your perception
of the facts.
- That is the most
important lesson
that history can teach us,
all right?
- Okay.
So what are the facts?
- The facts are that Evan
and Sam played a scary game
and Sam got scared.
- There you have it,
okay?
So why don't you two stay away
from the scary stuff,
all right?
- Way ahead of you.
Evan already promised me
that they wouldn't do it again.
- Good enough.
- l think you should
make friends with it.
- What's that, honey?
- Well, if there's really
a ghost in Evan's room,
l think he should make friends
with it.
- Well, that's
an interesting idea,
but l think we should just
leave well enough alone.
- Yeah.
- Well, if there was
a ghost in my room,
l'd try to keep it happy.
- Sam?
Can l talk with you for a sec?
- Mom, she's fine.
- Just sit down with me.
You're probably gonna hate this.
This is one of those weird adult
talks that makes kids sick,
and l'm practically a stranger.
But you entered my son's life
rather abruptly,
which means
you've entered my life.
l could be a friend to you,
if you let me.
- Okay.
- l know how unfair it is.
l get it.
- You get what?
- This.
- No, that's-that's not
what you think.
- Come on, Sam.
lf you don't want to talk to me,
you could talk
to a professional,
someone who will listen
and keep what you say
to themselves.
- No.
Thanks, but no.
- There's no shame in it.
- l'm not ashamed.
- You have him wrapped
around your finger.
l think you know that.
Don't hurt him.
- They're taking Sarah
to visit a couple of colleges.
- Are they nervous
leaving us alone?
- Yeah, kind of.
- What'd they say?
- That they're nervous.
- Evan.
- Yeah?
- You know how kids
can understand things
that adults can't?
- Sure.
- Well?
- Well, what?
- Well...
like your sister said,
do you want
to make friends with it,
or do you want
to live with an angry ghost?
- What?
What?
What are you thinking?
- About that thing you said.
Do you think it's possible
that maybe you want
to prove there's a heaven
a little too badly?
- So, in other words,
l'm making all of this up.
- No, l didn't say that.
- Then what did you say?
- l'm saying that there's a lot
of good things about this life.
Why rush looking
for whatever comes next?
l'm saying l'm scared
of the consequences.
- l need to know what it wants,
okay?
l stared her in the eye.
And l lost my nerve,
and l wasn't prepared.
But l don't know.
l feel like this is-
this is one of those moments,
a moment to really
discover something,
and it's happening to us,
you and me.
Do you really want to stop
before you figure out
how it ends?
What are you doing?
- Coaxing.
- What happened to you?
- That's the spirit.
- Okay.
You ready?
Matthew?
Matthew, are you there?
Matthew, l really need to talk
to you.
What have you been trying
to tell us?
Okay, Matthew.
lf you won't talk to me,
maybe someone else will.
Hilary?
Kate?
Franklin?
- Samantha.
Sorry.
- Franklin, what happened
in this house?
What happened to your family?
- My room.
My room.
- Matthew?
- She's comjng.
Closer and closer.
- She? Who's she?
- Was she who l saw?
- She'll hear you.
- So who is she?
- Sam...
- Matthew, did she kill you?
- She's here!
She's here!
- Don't you move!
Please let me go.
Please let me go!
Please! Please!
- Evan?
Evan?
Evan?
- Evan?
Evan.
No! No! No!
Evan! Evan! Evan!
- Sam.
Look, l need to talk to you.
l don't know what happened to me
last night.
l'm sorry.
l have to see you, okay?
l need to see you.
Call me, please.
l'm worried about you.
Okay, bye.
- Yeah, l heard you
the first time.
What do you want?
- l was hoping l could speak
with Sam.
- Who are you?
A boyfriend?
- l'm not sure, exactly.
- Sam can't come
to the phone right now.
Leave a message after the beep.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- God, l'm sorry
about your eye.
- lt's not your fault.
- Yeah, it is.
- lt doesn't matter.
We're in this together.
- Okay.
- l'm not sure about this.
- Maybe she can tell us
something.
- Something like what?
- Like something useful,
something we should know,
something that could help us.
She was there the whole time.
Maybe she saw something.
Maybe there's something
we need to do.
- Do?
- Yeah.
- Well, what do you mean, do?
- Well, maybe it wants us
to do something,
like unfinished business.
- No.
- No?
- Whatever we started,
we need to stop.
Okay?
l'm not curious anymore.
l'm scared.
l'm scared we went too far.
l'm-l'm scared
you're gonna get hurt.
Hey, l wanted to see if we
could find a heaven, not...
not a hell.
- Then what do you think
we should do?
- We should stop
and pretend it never happened.
Eventually it'll go away.
- Sam, l don't think
it's gonna go away.
You know, l just figure
we've gone this far.
Why don't we go
a little further?
What do we gain from pretending
like it never happened?
lt did happen.
And whatever's in there isn't
just gonna forget about us.
- So what do you suggest we do?
- We just talk
with her a little,
see what she has to say.
l mean, maybe she can let us
know what we're up against,
what it wants.
- Evan, you need
to listen to me.
The way your face...
changed,
you looked like it.
Do you understand
what that means?
lt got inside you.
- Look, if we started this,
then we need to finish it.
- Yes?
- Mrs. Morello?
lt's Evan Asher.
- Oh.
What are you doing here?
- We need your help.
- My help?
- Can we come in?
- No. No.
l-l don't think so.
What do you mean,
you need my help?
- There's something
in that house,
and we need
to know what it is.
- What are you talking about?
Something where?
- Well, it's not
so much where as-
- A ghost, okay?
lt's a ghost.
And we thought maybe
you could help us.
How could you?
How could you come here
and disturb what little peace
l have left?
Have you been messing about
in that little room
with that box?
Now, you listen to me.
You burn that box
and stay out of there.
- Stay out of there!
- Evan.
Hey!
Evan!
- What?
- What if she's wrong?
She makes it seem so simple.
What if it isn't?
- We don't have a choice.
Here.
There.
No one will ever
bother you again.
You have a room all your own.
Now stay out of mine.
- Hey.
Everything's gonna be okay,
right?
- Yeah.
Everything's gonna be okay.
- So it's over?
- lt's over.
Okay.
- Hi, this is the Ashers.
Leave a message.
- Hey, it's Dad.
They've closed
the road to the house,
so we're kind of
stuck down here,
some kind of accident...
On your own.
As soon as they reopen
the road,
We'll head home.
- Matthew!
l'm begging you.
Don't make a sound.
And don't you move.
Evan.
Evan?
Evan!
Evan, get the door open!
- l can't!
lt won't open!
- Evan, she's coming!
Please!
- Please!
Please let me go!
Please, let me go!
Please!
- Evan.
- Tell me something.
- Let me go!
- Do you really and honestly
think l'm gonna let you go?
Please.
Please!
- Listen to your voice,
all breathy and delightful,
even when you're terrified.
- No!
- ls that what she sounded like
in bed, my dear?
- l'm sorry.
- Please, don't do this!
l'll do anything!
- Oh, l think you've already
done enough, haven't you?
- Franklin!
- You seduced my husband.
You brought his illegitimate
bitch into the world.
Poor little Samantha.
And you've held the brat
under my nose,
expecting me not
to sniff it out,
expecting me not
to do anything about it.
- Aah! No!
- Franklin.
Look.
l want you to see this.
Franklin, look at me!
No!
No!
- Are you ready,
young lady?
- Please don't hurt him.
Please.
- Sam.
Hey.
Sam. lt's me.
- You shouldn't have closed
that door.
- Please.
- Hey, guys.
We're home.
- Something's wrong.
- Where's the lights?
- You shouldn't have burned
that box!
- No! No!
No!
- Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.
Mommy. Mommy.
- No!
Mommy!
- And that,
as they say, is that.
The Ashers left, and the girl
was sent away.
She was just a cancerous
little thing, like her mother.
How did l feel when l heard?
l felt nothing.
l wonder now if the boy
will haunt that rotting house
forever,
along with my family,
waiting for others to arrive
to share the truths they'd find,
the truths we'll all
someday find.
Death, after all, is the house
we all finally come home to.
Rest assured of that.
See, every ghost story
might begin
With a house and a tragedy,
but they don't alWays
end the same.
Sometimes the tragedy
stays buried,
and some houses
are more dead than others.
