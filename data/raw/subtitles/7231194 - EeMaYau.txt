How does one survive
in times like these?
Backthen,
He started talking again!
What is he blabbering
about all the time?
In the church! Where else?
Tomorrow itself go and tell the Father
Will you?
Once they turn told, even
humans shouldn't be spared.
You never attend Sunday mass
And he hates that!

If something like that happens,
Mom! Look what dad has brought?
Banned currency notes!
How will you conduct
my funeral then?

Your dad didn't stop

So, you want to see it?
- Yes
Where did you disappear?
Darling, am I not a mother-in-law
Who really cares for her daughter-in-law?
In which case, when you die,

But 4000 plus is still due
When I asked you to deduct interest
What did you say?
You go there.

Go and wash your face..
Why are you sitting here like this?
Don,A6t we have to inform everyone?
Do one thing

Have you entrusted
everything to your children?
I don't know anything!
You betrayed me!
Ayyappan..
He came with a duck today
And he was quite ok
Then, why did you leave all of a sudden?
Dear, you only asked me to prepare
Duck curry with potato?
He arrived only in the evening
And left already?
Yes .. but he was talking about my dues
And it was all cooked up!
Who?
- Either Chavaro or Eesy..
You are mad!
He died peacefully at home
What about the money
- I've taken 100 bucks, ok?
You don't talk nonsense like this, ok?
lthink Ponnappan and Kochanto are
having a drink. Want to go and check?
If you win the game
Calm down..
Eesy, why have you left
the body like this?
So much blood, oh my God!
Would I leave you?
Eesy, what happened to your
dad all of a sudden..?
Did you inform the church?
They won't come..They have removed my name
as I haven't paid my dues
Is it necessary?
He is dead, now what is the use?
Let us lift Asan's body to the cot
You go and bring the doctor
Lazar, you too go with him.
On the way, inform the vicartoo
Few minutes back, I saw him..
lthink something
wrong has happened
There is something fishy..
Who? The mason who built our
altar in single piece of wood?
If he is dead, why do
you need a doctor?
Then lwill call him
Look, he is lying drunk
Even an elephant can't
wake him up now
How long can I wait?
I too had 3 pegs
She is enough to confirm death
You better leave..
This doctor and nurse ,Ai they are in love
Very intimate..
All this is yourfantasy
Don't tell calumny
Yourtongue will rot
Give me a chair..
Call from my phone
Eesy,A6s dad died..
Fine.
Usual contentwill do, isn't it?
No need of changes, right? I'll read it.
My dear husband and head of our household,
Son of Valiyaparambil Varghese Antony..
Son of Chori
With profound sorrow
We inform you of his eternal rest in God..
Okay. Let me know.
Whom to mention as
bereaved family members?
Wife Zabeth, right?
Just mention her name Elizabeth
No, it is how we call her at home..
Actual name is Mariam Thresia
Okay. Heard it!
Ok, I will do that..
Moreover, Vavachan
belongs to our parish
And the doctor specifically
mentioned you by name..
Then you can take
the bike with him..
Did the doctor say so?
- Yes.
How can I say disobey doctor?
Come.
Look, I'll ride the bike
Don't know if the seat is dusty.
Lazar, what you said was right.
This Saramma is a real whore. - Of course.
Yes, I'll inform you..
It will be past 3.30 anyway
Hello, this is regarding
Vavachan,A6s death
Me? I am his neighbour.
Why?
You didn't like it, eh?
Get lost!
Come if you wish to!
Shouldn't we inform those
in Pattani island?
No, not yet Mostly tomorrow evening.
We've to confirm it with the priest..
Pennamma, it is me, Saramma
No need to split your chest for my sake!
Why do you want
to know all that?
He drank rum or arrack?
No.
This won't work, let us go..
Then what?
I cant call him now..
He's drunk. Tell me what you want..
It is a serious case
He has a head injury and it is bleeding
lam going now
Look, I'll tell the doctor what I
saw when he comes tomorrow morning.
Sister, where are you going?
Father..
The Vicar must be asleep..
Shall we inform him tomorrow?
Father, we've come with an
even more complex case..
Hejust fell and died..
It is not a murder or anything
For what?
- That is the mystery..
He rushed home
Swearing he'll settle scores with his dad
You come with me..
Then?
This Vavachan often disappears..
What? - lfthere is no other
way, she'll poison him..
There was a loud cry.. When neighbours
rushed there, he was lying dead
Pranchi, tell me what
really happened?
Are you not coming to his house?
This is what is called slander
(talking to himself)
I promised him I'll do itwith
music band and mourning song.
Since he said that,
We should do it well
We'll pawn it with Koorman
He is cut-throat..
Give it.
You go and get it. Go.
That's the only speck of gold I have
Not that!
And see me with nothing around
my neck, who will be shamed?
What about the wedding locket?
- I won't pawn that.
Beast!
Oh god! What are you saying?
What are you doing
with my dearest?
Hold it, man..
Morethan enough! I lost my sleep!
Come, let us go..
You've left us all in the dark..
,AoGo and die,A6, right?
But I was in deep sleep..
Now cover yourface and scram
Last time, when power went
off in Ammini,A6s house
Vavachan died. Didn't you know?
What is it?
Something fishy
I smell an unnatural death
Firstly, the dead
man's head is broken
The son drank brandy
And dad had arrack
His face has turned dark blue
See for yourself.
- Okay.
Did anyone foresee this?
But I have no vengeance
against him..
As you only have the money,A1]
I won't give you
Now, leave the place..
So as a member ofthe ward, will you
pay the principal and interest?
Or, if you have come with any other plans
Better scram..
Not cheque, I've jewellery
Don't tell me..
I know you're not going to take it back
You take it and
vacate the place ok?
Brother, if we pay principal and interest
You'll return it?
Nisa!
Who is there for me now?
A saintly man who made our altar
And you turned him into a murderer!
I didn't say he is a murderer
I said someone murdered him
It is certain!
Out of sorrow, he must have said something
hard &they must have finished him off
Chavaro bro, why do
you tell such lies?
One cannot be sure about it
Let the doctor come, conduct postmortem
And confirm it..
Oh Father!
Here lies the man who came with a duck
Asking me to prepare curry, Father!
Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be'ITyour'ITname.
Hail'ITMary'ITfull of Grace,
the'ITLord'ITis with thee.
Blessed are thou among women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.
HOIYTTMaryWTMother of God,
pray for us sinners now
(continues chanting prayers)
(continues chanting prayers)
Cheap one is fine, right?
Let us go for a better one
- Why?
What is this?
Your dad, a king, eh?
- Eesy, you come inside and select one
Throw it away!
I threw it.
- Eesy, what you said is right.
I'll get you a good coffin
This is really worth it
Ordinary coffins use softwood
It gets rotten soon
This will do
Let's fix it.
Eesy, don,A6t worry about the money
Take it now
We've to pay at the church
I'm telling you! Take it!
Yes, flowers
And even beautician too
Come on, tell us
Ok. When I say a price, I
don't want any problems later
It is 40,000 rupees
Are you crazy? Can't we
buy this from Ernakulam City?
What do you want it for?
I will reduce 10 per cent
- 10 per cent?
If you want, you can
select the colour too
I told you 10 per cent
- I told you, that won't do
Spoiling a grand funeral?
Listen to me..
Have a look
- Eesy!
My dad should rest in
this blackwood coffin
You should have thought about it When
you spent everything on that coffin
I think he loved her..
You are still awake?
When is the funeral?
You just come with your team, ok?
See you tomorrow
The coffin has arrived!
Untie that knot..
Get lost, you dimwit
I've seen many coffins like this
Come here, you are drunk
Don't create ruckus ..
Come here.
- What is it?
What about yours?
All these are bought with that..
Give me your chain..
People will be
watching us, not you..
To see if we can get the Bishop
Are you mad?
Zabeth, enough.
lam not feeling well
Give me some water
Son, Eesootty,
Here lies our dearest..
I am Vicar Zacharias
His death is a bit suspicious
It is a bit problematic
You should go there
immediately, sir.
Our carelessness should not
Get our parish into trouble. That's all!
He is always drunk
So they've thrown him out of the house
Why do you ask me? Ask the Lord
Not sure, if it is an
angel or the Trinity
Next to Rozario's, isn't it?
Done"
You didn't call me yet! Have you
confirmed the time of funeral?
Tell me fast.. I've to start work
on souvenir and wedding card..
Now let us finish
this before you dig
This should be the best
grave you ever dug
The man who built the altar
If you die, it should be likethis
But..
Zabeth, your parents have come..
He is gone.
You can't see him again!
Those who never came when you were alive
Have come to see you
He always used to talk about you..
He never insisted on dowry..
Even then, why do you
remain silent, dear?
It was given to buy
coffin and dress for him
You'll need money,
Keep this..
Didn't your parents come?
- Go. They are waiting there.
No
Meet the Vicar soon and
fix the funeral time
Have you fixed the time?
How did Vavachan die?
Did the doctor say that?
She said she'll tell the
doctor and he'll certify it
What is this sir?
If you appoint those priests as
police It would be like this!
The grave-digger has fallen in the grave!
Sexton!
The rain is not receding..
Why don't we call him?
Then you come..
Let us wash the body
Velayudhan, come here!
All the villagers have come
Are you leaving us and going?
Are you leaving my
children and going?
He has been dead for
quite some time now.
Inform his house
He never goes home, father
Let us go to Vavachan's house
"When you laugh,
Thousands will come with you to laugh along"
"But when you cry
Only your shadow will come with you.."
"Only your shadow
will come with you"
Come! Come!
Put the body back in the coffin!
Pranchi, what are you doing?
Lift it!
They cheated you!
Keep it properly.
Move!
Did he take commission
for his father's coffin?
Look if it is beneath the coffin
Search for the cross!
Got it? - Here it is.
- Where?
Your doctor has come..
He came to see even in the morning
Keep the towel there..
Where do I put these roses?
Oh my darling..
He is my children's father!
Take her away..
What's the problem?
- Where is Eesy?
What's the problem?
Who's that?
Pradip, ltold you
I'll inform you..
Eesy, it is a mess there!
Easy, wait.
Don,A6t create a ruckus
They've broken my husband's skull!
He is my father as well.

None of you will go back alive!
I killed my father, is it?
Beat him up..
Have you come here to ruin the
funeral, listening to gossip?
Father, they've killed
my child's father
Who are you?
- We are from Pattani island
This is our sister, Barbara.
Go and see, Father
They've hit him on the head
Venting your anger on a woman?
Don't listen to this b!$!#@$.
Move away!
Leave my hand, you hag!
Did you see this?
His head is broken!
U ntie it!
You can't bury him in the church otherwise
That's all
If there is a legal issue later
You won't be able to solve it
This whore's complaint?
Are you going to cut open my dad's
body Listening to their words?
You can't do athing at the church
Eesy, what is this?
You watch out!
Eesy, what the hell did you do?
Now there,A6s no point
going there..
Everyone has come?
- Yes, father..
No need
Yes, let it be
Father, please do something about it..
That's all!
- Don't say that!
Ayyappan, now I've informed
the Circle Inspector;
Go and fall at the feet
of the Inspector..
Pranchi, will you ask him to stop it!
Hey, hold it..
Move, I say!
Sir, please move.
Afriend of Rajan sir,
Mem berAyyappan is here..
Come inside, Ayyappan..
- Sir, I'm all drenched.
Sir, just a minute.

And now his second wife and son
Are creating trouble there
If you can't, should I come

His time is up..
What about this wound?
But the Father is obstinate
About filing a case..
Sir..

Please do something..
You come here.. Let me tell you something
- Don't say that, sir.
You go and plead with the Father
ltoo will call him..
Inform Ayyappan too..
Eesy!
But it was good.
Because I couldn,A6t get a gold cross
The church has only silver cross, so..
Brother-in-law gave me 1500 rupees
That I gave to Ayyappan..
Lonappan Chettan reduced 5000
for the first class coffin.
There was no need to hit the electrician.
ItoId him!

What are you going to do to dad?
Don't you dare touch him!
Leave me!
