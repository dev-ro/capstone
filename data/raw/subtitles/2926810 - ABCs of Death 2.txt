Hi, I'm Peter Toland.
Welcome to Toland's World.
This week we're in Elderberry Vale in
Nottinghamshire, a thriving stretch
of classic English countryside.
Home to literally thousands
of indigenous plants and animals
including a 400-year-old
badger sett,
which has crisscrossed this hill
for untold generations.
But in the last two years,
the badgers have disappeared because
a shadow has fallen across this hill,
a shadow in the form of this.
Are you gonna pan off me? Hello? Are you
gonna pan to the power station or--? Man:
Yeah, okay, cut. Sorry, Peter. We gotta cut.
Peter: No, no, don't cut. Do not cut.
- Peter: What's happening? - Man:
Sorry. We lost focus
- a few times earlier, so-- - Peter:
Yeah? We lost focus? - Or you lost focus?
- I could do with another crack
- at that, Peter, sorry.
- Could you? Another crack. Well,
what's going on? You lost focus.
That's the whole point. That's your job,
isn't it, Brian? Brian:
We just didn't realize you were going
to move around so much.
Of course I move around. That's my style.
There were some quite large movements.
We could whack down a sausage for you,
Peter, if that's-- I don't want a
sausage. Yeah? Shove it up your ass.
Man: No, look, all I meant was-- No, look,
Dom, let me explain how this works, okay?
- Man: It's John. - Whatever your name is,
I move around, you follow me,
that's the way it works on Toland's World.
- It's like a dance, okay? - Yeah, I get it.
- So should we cut now and go again-- - No.
I say cut, that's how it works
on the show. Okay?
I call cut and until then,
we keep filming.
You got that? Right,
that's how we roll. All right?
- John: Okay. Yeah. - Good. Prick. (laughs)
Man: Honestly, don't worry about it.
It's just a little alpha male display
and it'll all blow over,
I swear to you.
Look, he knows you worked with
Attenborough, right? So he just feels
a bit threatened. John: Ah, right.
It's all about
the Silver Leopard Awards.
Man: Yeah, he's a bit raw. Well done,
though. Good work. Really good work.
John: Yeah, cheers. So does he think
he should have won them or... Man:
He's been nominated three times,
and now he think Attenborough's rigging it.
(laughs) I know.
- (faint growling) - John: Whoa.
What was that? Man : Hang on,
let me listen, let me listen. Hang on.
- (growling)
- Oh!
- (laughing)
- Whoa!
- John: Greedy little buggers.
- Man: Whoa!
- Oh! - John: You getting this,
Brian? - (laughter) - Yeah.
- Waiting for badgers. - Having fun, are we?
Big fun. Fun times. Clue me in. Let's have a
laugh. Peter, the badgers are still here.
The badgers are... No, the badgers are dead
because of the toxins from the power
station. That's what the episode is about.
- Look, we put the-- - Put
what? - We should carry on
filming. - Who are you anyway?
You waltz in here at the last
minute, calling the shots. John:
I didn't waltz in anywhere.
I don't want to hear any more from you, okay?
- But listen, Peter. - Can you hear me?
- I mean, is this for real? - Of course it's
real. And it's gonna get more real because
someone's gonna get punched in a minute.
- Man: Look, please. - John: Listen,
Peter, - I'm just trying to help-- - I do
not wanna hear one more word from you.
John: Uh, shall I text you
or...?
Oh! Ow! Don't just stand there.
Give me a hand.
- (roaring)
- Ah! Oh!
- Man: Jeez!
- (Peter grunting)
- Man: Peter? - (Peter screaming)
- Man: Peter! - Oh, God.

Cut.
- (indistinct shouting)
- Quiet!
Quiet!
People, settle, settle.
Justice will be done,
but not here.
Fletcher Powell, this court finds
you guilty - of the murder of
Lucy Wilson. - (crowd shouting)
- Child killer!
- I didn't kill her!
I did not kill her!
You need to let me go.
You need to call the police!
You need to deal with this
the right way! The only way!
All local matters
are dealt with internally.
- You know that.
- This is a matter of law!
Your authorities do not stretch
to those boundaries!
- Barclay. - (grunting) Man:
If you confess now, we shall call
the proper authorities.
Deny, and you will be executed this
afternoon. - (crowd shouting) - Very well.
- I killed Lucy.
- (all shouting)
- Bastard!
- I dumped her body
in the River Kennet beyond
Eddington. There you go.
There's my confession,
now call the police!
- You said! You promised!
- You all heard him! You all bore witness!
You shall be taken from this
court to the place of execution
 with no further delay.
Female Newscaster: The main headlines this
lunchtime: Lucy Wilson, missing for over a
month and presumed dead,
has been found alive and well in East
Yorkshire. The 14-year-old had run
away with her 26-year-old boyfriend,
 who has been arrested
by local authorities.
Hey, guys, she's alive! Lucy's
alive! It's all over the news!
Come on, faster!
So this it? You're just gonna
shoot me like some dumb animal?
Oh, Jesus Christ, no, please! Don't do this!
Father, don't let them do this! Please!
Dearly beloved, it hath pleased Almighty God,
in his justice,
to bring you under sentence
- and condemnation of the law.
- Hold him down. (sobbing)
You can't!
Please, you can't kill me!
- Father, please stop! - You are to suffer
death in such a manner, that others,
warned by your example,
may be the more afraid
to offend.
- Oh, fuck!
- (tires screech)
- (grunting)
- (crow cawing)
What the fuck, Tobias! You didn't hit him
hard enough! I'll hit him a fucking again
then, won't I?
Oh, fucking hell! You nearly took my
fingers off! - Well, fucking move back
then! - Decorum, boys.
- Give this man his dignity. - Father,
shut the fuck up! For the love of God,
finish this! (grunting)
(screaming)
- (bone cracking)
- Tobias: Finish him off.
And we pray, God,
that you may make such use
of your punishments in this
world, - that your soul may be
saved-- - You're blooded now.

Ugh.

Oh, I'm here every night.
And you keep me awake all night,

Are you trying to look like me?
Yes. (laughs)
Is that all right?
Ooh... Ah...
What have you got on your
finger? I got this in Chad.
It's for opening mollusks.
And I'm absolutely loving it!
Hey, that my catch phrase!

One more question. True or false:
 A roller-coaster has a minimum
rider height of four feet tall.
Johnny is three feet six inches tall
and Jimmy is four feet six inches tall.
Jackie is taller than Johnny and shorter than
Jimmy. Jackie can ride the roller-coaster.
True or false. Jackie can ride
the roller-coaster.
 She's taller than Jimmy?
Both: Shorter than Jimmy.
Taller than Johnny.
Okay, so all these have
to be true-false, right?
Woman: This question reads
"true-false."
Man: Okay, um...
Can I say "unanswerable"
or "trick question"
or something like that?
- Woman: Under what reasoning?
- Man: Well, you don't know...
You don't know how much taller.
 Like it could be, you know,
an inch, it could be two feet.
I'm, like, looking at your face
for clues. Uh... - Woman:
That's all right. - Man: So, yeah.
My final answer is the question
is unanswerable.

Basically, why we're shooting
your audition today
is to show the producers what
you're comfortable doing,
what you're able to do,
and willing to do.
It's really like
an attitude thing.
If I told you to suck my dick,
would you do as you're told?
Or would there
be some sort of an issue?
Open your mouth for me please?
Good.

You a little whore?

You know, a lot of girls would
kill for this opportunity.
So you gotta stand above
the competition.
Wow. Phew,

Are you blind?
We're gonna have to get some, uh,
sunglasses for her on the day of the shoot.
We are gonna need to see your body.
Unfortunately, producers are kind
of picky about that kind of thing.
So if you could just take off that
retarded dress that you're wearing.

have told you, okay? - But it was all

This fucking door won't open!
Stop! Stop!

Fucking door won't open!
Dylan! Oh, I'm
going to fuck you up, bitch!
I'm gonna fuckin' stab that
screwdriver right in your
fucking cunt, you fucking...
(screaming)

- (yelps)
(sobbing)
(woman speaks foreign language)
- (beeping)
- Amber: Tell me he's okay.
(sobbing)
 Do you speak English?!
 No!
Narrator: Champions of Zorb.
Harmonia is under attack.
 Has the heroic Prince Casio
finally met his match?
- No!
- Narrator: Who dares challenge
the evil Mindlord Zorb?
Don't worry,
Fantasy Man will save you.
Narrator: Terrify your opponents
with the mighty Fantasy Man.
- I wish we could help Prince Casio.
- Yeah! Narrator: Now you can explore
the world of Zorb.
Where are we?
Both: Prince Casio?
We're dead! We're all
fucking dead! (grunting)
(men shouting)
(lasers zapping)
Man: Ah!
(man screams)
Help me!

(creature roaring)
No! No!

Man: No! No!
No!
(whimpering)
What?
(garbled electronic voice

(groaning)
Fantasy Man: Don't
be scared, princess.
It's me...
...Fantasy Man.
(thunder rumbles)
- (Fantasy Man whistles)
- Huh?
Ah! Yah!
Sleep, Fungor,
my old friend.
Quickly,
princess, into the sack.
There's no time!
Quickly, into the sack!
(creature screeching)
Boy: Where are we going?
Almost there, princess.
- We're almost there.
- Boy: No, No, No!
(boy continues shouting) No!

Woman (sobbing): Don't leave
me. Don't leave me, Ti, please!
The midwife said chewing on
portlock root will slow down the
baby until I can get her from town.
Just take small bites.
Woman: Oh, Ti, please don't leave!
- I don't want to be alone! - You'll be fine.
There's years enough root in that jar,
and she's not even a half a day out. Woman:
Come back, Ti! I don't wanna be alone again!
Please, Ti!
(wind howling)
Woman: Ti!
(woman moaning)
Ti!
Ti!
- (woman continues moaning)
- (door opens) - Ti! - (wind howling)
Ti?
(bell jingles)
Baby: Is it him, Mama?
No, it's not, sweetie.
(meowing, hissing)
Baby: What did we catch, Mama?
- (cat hissing)
- A mean, old bunny rabbit.
(cat meowing)
Baby: Mom, why don't you go out
and catch the rabbit
instead of waiting for it to get trapped?
I can't be running around looking for
rabbit with you inside of me.
Baby: You should let me come out
then. Why do you want to come out?
Don't you like spending
time with your mom?
Baby: No, it's not that.
Well, it sounds to me like you wanna
leave your mom - in this place all by
herself. - Baby: That's not what I meant.
Don't know what I'd do
if you left me here all alone.
Baby: I'm sorry, Mama,
I'm just sick of eating the same
things all the time, is all.
Well, you can come out
when your dad gets back.
And if you're a boy, he can take you out when
he goes hunting. Baby: I hope I'm a boy.
Well, he'll be back any day now,
we'll find out then. But for now,
you're just a little baby.
(screaming)
Baby: You all right, Mama?
Where is it?
There was a piece left,
I know there was some left.
- Baby: Where's what?
- Mama's medicine!
(screaming)
- (groaning) - Baby: Calm down,
Mama. You gotta let me come out now.
You promised,
you said you won't leave!
Baby: But I'm too big and it's
hurting me. Don't you leave me!
(moaning)
(sobbing)
Baby: I won't leave you, Mama. (groaning)
(screaming)
Baby: It's okay, Mama,
I'm here, just calm down.
(sobbing) You can't leave.
Baby: Don't worry, Mama,
I'm not leaving.
I don't wanna be alone again.
Baby: I won't leave you,
Mama, I just need more room,
okay? - (cracking) - (sighs)
Baby: Don't worry,
I can fix this, Mama.
Just stay calm.
Baby: See, Mama?
Now there's room for both of us.
(banging)
(rattling)
(insects chirping)
(door creaking)
- Ti, is that you?
- Do I really look
that different?
- Where have you been?
- Don't start.
I waited as long as I could,
but it didn't sit right.
I had to cut it out myself.
Then we'll just
have to try again.
I don't know if I can.
Of course you can.
