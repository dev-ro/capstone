FLIRTING SCHOLAR
Why? I’ve waited for 3 hours, why hasn't he come out yet?
Usually, he will come out not more than 2 hours
Put the rubbish in front of the door.
Yes.
Let's fight for it.
I have got the painting of Tong Pak Fu
Give it to me.
It's mine......
Isn't one dish of soy enough?
Slowly please.
Many people come for your paintings. why don't you bother?
I have no mood to draw.
Give them 2 more baskets of rubbish. that's it.
Yes.
Mr. Chuck
Brother Tong.
Mr. Chuck.
Help. Brother Tong.
I think. you must have lost all your money.
You understand me so well.
Everyone knows you love gambling among the "Four Scholars".
"Having no money to live comfortably", it is your living guide, right?
You are flattering me! You're born to be a free liver.
In fact, you are much more luckier than me.
But, you lose much money per every two days.
and you come to seek help from me after losing money.
I don't think I can help you forever.
Sure! Because of that. I tried to risk for the last time.
But, I lost the money which I could earn till my death.
That's 300,000 taels.
So, I have to beg you to draw 30 pictures so as to save my life.
I understand pretty well.
Shui, go out first.
Yes, master.
Damn you. don't you think I owe you that? you need 30 pictures?
No way.
Please! It’s my fault, I am now begging you to forgive me.
Remember? I lent you the blue magazine when you were a child!
I always sell the pictures for you. which make you become rich!
Some loan-sharks are waiting for me outside,
They want me to get 30 pictures of yours with one hour.
Or, they'll kill me! Are you helping me or not?
One hour? Well, since you are my brother,
I will write you lament for your funeral.
Say,” A bastard", or "A scumbag", which one do you like?
Choose between these two.
Pak Fu, don't be that mean to me.
I swear, if I gamble again,
I will be terribly raped by an ugly woman until death.
Or, until my dick rotten, OK?
You made such worst oath!
OK, I will save you for the last time.
Men, give me the stationery.
You are such a heroic friend, so righteous!
Cut the crap, undress.
Undress?
What are you doing?
What?
Open it.
Fantastic! It’s worth being tortured!
What is it called?
It's great! It's called "Great Eagle".
It worths over 300,000 taels.
Don't bother me again.
Sure, but, you amazed me.
You used my nipples as flowers.
You used my palms as trees.
My ass is painted as stone.
Cloud and mountains are drawn on my feet.
About that eagle, which part of my body is used?
It's your penis.
I guessed it correctly.
It's sanctuary! How wonderful!
Your penis is used to be the little worm hung on the eagle's mouth.
Do you think it's sanctuary and wonderful?
That's good.
It's useful anyway.
Tong Pak Fu was born in Ming Dynasty, in the year of Tiger.
He was named Tong Yan
Yan means tiger in Chinese, so he was named Pak Fu (First Tiger).
He was very clever & was good in writing poems and paintings.
He was the leading scholar of the "Four Scholars" In Ming Dynasty.
Tong Yan was the idol of many people.
He was envied by many men, cause he had 8 pretty wives.
He seemed to be the most lucky guy in the world!
Hands up. do you have money? Please lend it to me first.
Kidding! So poor are you!
I have got money, I can keep on playing now.
Pay me now.
You always win, I wonder, are you a swindler?
Honies, come and eat the chicken wings!
Why are you that late?
Hey, are you ready?
We're ready...........
Oh, my "Hundred Flowers"!
Don't be so mean, please lend it tome to fix the table.
You are not dying, you may draw another one any time you like.
But.............
Cut the crap, play with me.
Choi Choi, make it three, four thirty.
What are you doing?
Oh, my poetry!
Look at it, the table is not balanced,
One book is not enough, bring me two more please.
Why a bird is missing from my picture?
Cut the crap! I have lost a bird from my mahjong.
So I cut the head to represent the lost mahjong. That's it.
You.........
Mother, what are you doing?
Mon wants to suicide!
Go and take a look of her now...........
Hold it, let's finished this first.
Watch mine, I am the winner.
You jinx!
Money please.
Mon, are you crazy?
I am useless, I've married you with 8 wives, but you aren't satisfied.
You always have a long face.
I think, I have to kill myself cause I’ve no face!
Why did you say so?
I didn't blame you!
Pak Fu, you are young and successful.
You are rich and you have so many wives.
You should be the happiest guy in the world.
I haven't said I was unhappy.
Why do you always have a long face?
Don't you think your wives don't match you?
It's easy to get a wife but not easy to get a wife who understands me
Although they are my wives.
They don't really understand my mind.
Don't you think we can't match you?
We'd better suicide!
What? 9 of you will be hanging together?
How amazing!
Help!
Daughters-in-law, are you alright?
Pak Fu, do you want them all to suicide, will you feel happy about that?
I don't mean..............
Let me go, I want to die.
Don't do that!
Pak Fu, could you say something?
Shut up.
It's my fault, all of you are very nice.
Cultured and civilized.
But I should have appreciated, It's my fault.
Sorry, please forgive me.
I am so happy about that!
Hubby, smile, come on.
Come on, smile.
Why don't you laugh happily?
You should laugh happily!
Come on, be happy.
Show us a happy look.
Let's play.
Pak Fu, see, they always want you to be happy.
Don't misunderstand them, got me?
Madam, King Ning sends someone here to visit Young Master.
King Ning?
King Ning is planning a revolution.
Doesn't he want to recruit you?
Anyway, just ask them to leave, I don't want to see them.
This way.
Madam, they.............
Where is Tong Pak Fu?
Our majesty wants him to be his consultant.
Ask him to come out now.
I am sorry, my son is very sick, he can't receive you.
Please express our sincere thanks to His Majesty.
What a coincidence! These we want to recruit always get sick.
But, it's been predicted by Our Majesty already.
He asked us to bring the doctor here, to check his sickness.
Madam...........
Tong Pak Fu.
Isn't he sick?
He............. he has been seriously sick.
But, how can a patient get appetite to eat chicken wings?
Yes, it's strange.........
It's simple, because..........
I love chicken wings.
But your mom said you are going to die.
That's why I have to eat more before I die.
If I don't eat now, I'll have no chance to eat.
Are you going to die?
I am going to die.
If I don't eat now, I will have no chance to eat.
But he doesn't seem to be seriously sick.
Doctor, check the pulse for Mr. Tong. See how serious is his sickness.
Yes.
His pulse is normal.
I don't think he is sick.
How is he?
Can he be saved?
Let me try.
What's wrong?
I haven't experienced such a messy pulse.
What did you feel from his pulse?
Music!
What?
I think, you have to prepare for his funeral.
See you, Mr. Tong.
We shouldn't have wasted our time. let's go.
Doctor, please save me.
Bastard, kneel down.
Do you remember? You have had an oath before your dad's grave.
You will never show others you know Kung-fu!
Why have you shown Kung-fu just then?
I remember, but it was an emergency.
I just used my Kung-fu to change my pulse only, no big deal.
But, in case...........
If your secret is discovered by our enemies.............
You will be in danger.
Mom, who are our enemies?
Why don't you tell me?
I was afraid you'd look for trouble since you were young.
But, you’ve grown up, I should tell you anyway.
We have 2 enemies........
One is called "Evil Scholar".
He fought with your dad for the championship on the weapon list.
I was afraid he would play tricks.
So I stayed and watched over their duel.
Let me trap you instead.
Brother Tinho, you will be the winner, don't worry.
Higher than you.
Go to hell.
What is it?
Chussy.
Watch out.
Go to hell.
Chussy, you.........
Be careful!
I have to use the last stance!
Go to hell.
Chussy, what the hell are you doing here?
I
Be careful!
Don't go, you should tell me what you are doing here.
I love you, so I want to help you.
Don't you think the red beans can help me?
It's not red beans, it's my new invention, the Tiny Bombs!
What? Tiny what?
Don't look down upon it, it's really powerful.
What? Powerful what?
Damn you, Chussy, do you want to play tricks?
The "Killing Sword Stance" of the "Evil Scholar"?
In the most critical moment.
Your dad attacked him with the most horrible weapon in the world.
He twisted the whole situation.
Watch out.
My Wonder Spear!
Where is the spear-head?
Why?
That's why dad died in great sorrow.
He couldn't imagine "Evil Scholar" ruined the steel made spear-head.
Before his death.
He made an invincible spear-head!
For he worried that the Evil Scholar would kill our whole family.
How about the other enemy?
Who is the next one?
She was your dad's girlfriend, she fought with me for your dad.
But she married later.
I don't think you would meet her again.
Mom, I want to leave home for few days.
I am afraid the people from King Ning would come to bother us.
You'd bring along the invincible spear-head with you, to be safe.
Remember.
Since your dad lost in the duel.
So, on the weapon list, the Evil Scholar is the 1st runner-up.
Tong's Spear is the 2nd runner-up.
Siu Lee's dagger is the 3rd runner-up.
Move!
Who is the champion?
The mom of Dagger Siu Lee, but she passed away.
Oh, what a pity.
Cut the crap, why not play with me?
Choi Choi, bingo, make it six.
Drink it.
You are too poor to compete with me.
Get lost, I wanna play with mom.
Choi Choi, make it three, why not nine.........
You lost, drink it.
I won't scare.
Come on, bet now.
I'm going to open it........
I am so miserable.
My wives are abnormal housewives.
But others envy me so much.
In fact, I am lonely.
Look, the "Four Scholars" are over there.
Go and have a look, hurry up........
Don't go........
You can never escape.
Brother Pak Fu, it's crowded.
We come here for a tour.
That's why the women are that crazy.
That's why!
Why not a poem competition?
Very good!
Why don't you start first? Brother Man-bun.
I'm strong in this field.
"There are many geese under the mountain".
"They rushed down to the river".
"Let's roast a goose"!
"After roasting, you’d better go home for a screw".
Good, very good.
Isn't it that funny?
I wonder, why are you always so happy when you are in a trip?
I envy you so much.
You are so good in making poems.
And you are an excellent artist.
You are really great!
But, you are good in playing music too.
Right, I know playing all kinds of music instruments.
I have studied a new kind of music, it's great.
Let's play it together if we've a chance.
I love it.
But, I envy you because of your wives.
All your wives are pretty.
I don't think you will have any regrets in your life.
I envy you so much.
Bravo........
There is something attractive.
See, there is a beauty. She seems to be lonely.
Why not show us how to court a girl for us
To let us learn!
Well..........
It's the welfare for your friends, so?
I am glad to demonstrate it.
Go.
Miss.
What's the matter?
Go, go.............
May I put my head on your shoulder?
No, I am a girl, a decent girl.
I know, I want to make my friends happy, that's all.
I am Tong Pak Fu.
So what? I don't know you.
I will shout for help if you don't leave me alone.
How about paying you 1 tael?
Who do you think I am?
Make it ten.
That's too expensive, why don't you rob?
Right, I am robber.
Give me al your money.
You.............
Go to hell.
Punch you!
Go to hell.
What's wrong?
What's up?
Don't you want to make a serious punch like this?
Robber! It's a ladyboy!
Ladyboy?
I love it. Hold it.
He is faster than me! Damn it.
Look, so many people!
Yes, it's crowded.
Chung-heung, Ha-heung, shut up, behave yourself.
What's going on?
Excuse me
Madam Wah and her 4 pretty maids have come for worshipping.
The maids are all pretty, especially Chou-heung.
Who is she? Who is Chou-heung?
Look! That way.
Chou-heung!
Damn, she is not pretty at all.
You know, pretty woman is like flowers.
You'll be all eyes for her beauty if some leaves around.
Look once more.
Pretty woman!
Woo, she is really pretty!
Let's go in the temple together.
To look for fun!
You will be our leader!
Follow me.
Give me.........
Give away, go that way!
Let's make use of any chance to take their advantage.
Sure.
Give the beggars the bread.
Yes, Madam.
Yes, Madam.
Give it to me.
Go.
Go.
Be merciful!
It's yours, everyone will get his share.
It's yours.
Don't fight for it, It's yours.
Help! I am damn hungry!
Are you hungry, eat this.
What? One is not enough?
One more for you.
Come over, here are some bread.
Be good, come on, eat this.
Thanks.
I've got it, the most pretty smile is the smile with love.
I have found my dream lover.
She is Chou-heung.
I've to chat with the monks.
Get a safety charm for me.
Yes, Madam.
Miss, are you coming to worship God?
It's good to worship God, so you will be blessed.
Let me do it for you.
To worship God........
Pal, chase the ship of Madam Wah.
Fine.
Be careful..............
You are wise to choose my ship.
My ship is the most speedy one.
Really?
Of course.
Hey, your ship is sinking.
Yes, it's speedy to sink.
What's wrong? I’m in a hurry!
I think you are chasing Chou-heung.
How do you know that?
I have seen many of your kind.
But, it's useless to court her outside Wah's house.
What good idea will you suggest?
You should go inside Wah's house.
Suggest some idea to me please.
But, it depends on your offer.
Alright.
Listen.........
You can't move! Got me?
Don't cheat me, you should pay me!
How can I cheat a wise guy like you?
That's right.
Cheap man! A brand new cheap man for sale.
Come and have a look!
I'm so poor!
Are you selling yourself to bury your dad?
But, it's not lucky to see a dead body early in the morning.
I don't wish to give you bad feeling.
You look familiar, where did I see you?
Really?
It doesn't matter, let's make friends now.
Why don't you be merciful, buy me please.
What a pity, we need a workman, why not.........
I am poor, I want to sell my self to bury my whole family!
Kidding?!
Be merciful, my family died last night.
I am sick, why not buy me? Maybe, I'll cut half price!
He's poorer, why not buy him to be our workman?
So, buy him.
Lady, first come first serve, I come first.
It's not a problem of priority.
He has to bury six and you have to bury one only.
I do want to help you, but, it's difficult for me to buy two.
But, I am poor too
Show me how poor you are.
Well, I........
See how dirty are my fingernails?
It's too pity, right?
Wong Choi, don't die! Don’t die.
You have followed me for a long time, you’re so good to me.
But, I have never given you sufficient food.
I am damn sorry.
Watch out.
Siu Keung, how are you?
Don't die, Siu Keung, don't die.
We have suffered for such a long time,
I take you as my relative.
How can you leave me like this..........
Sister Chou-heung, they are poor, what'll we do?
Let's wait and see.
Damn!
Brother, wait.
Look at you, you look rich, why not go home and make up first?
Look at me, I am thin, and see the abscess on my hands!
I am poorer.
Pal, don't challenge me.
So what?
Are you pushing me?
I am poorer, so what?
Go to hell!
See, my whole hand is cut off.
Who is poorer now?
Don't go too far!
It's show-hand, so what?
I'll play with you.
OK, I will show-hand too.
Are you playing tricks with me?
I don't want my life either, see how can you compare with me.
Who is poorer?
Bravo! You are really great.
Hey, he is dead, I can buy you now.
Really?
Right.
5 taels more please.
How can you raise your price suddenly?
I want to bury him too.
You are so kind, let's buy him.
Shek-lau, we have to ask the permission of Madam first.
Come again early tomorrow morning.
I'm going to ask Madam now.
Thank you, Miss Chou-heung.
Such a seducing smile!
Mom, I have got it.
Since you are so kind-hearted, I am now buying you to be workman.
For 6 years, any problem?
No problem.
Sing the contract now.
I am signing.
Come. Take this for me.
Mo Chong-yuen has arrived.
Why don't you squat?
Kid, from today onwards, you are the workman of here.
9527 is your number, work now.
Life is difficult.
But, you have to smile even you are scolded.
Life is difficult..........
You have to smile even you are scolded.
Life is difficult.
1001,1002,1003,1004..........
How can you do like this? Once more.
1,2................
Hurry up.
Roast it carefully, reserve the best part for me.
It's time for dinner!
Higher, make it higher, it's funny.............
There's a chance.
It's cut!
What'll I do?
What's happened?
9527, get the kite down for us.
Hurry up.
I'm a low ranking workman, it's inconvenient for me to get in.
We don't treat you as low ranking workman.
I just treat you as a dog!
Go and get it, go!
Up there.
Miss Chou-heung, I didn't have a chance to thank you.
But, it's destiny for us to meet again.
Don't worry about the kite, I will get it for you.
Cut the crap, go and get it back now.
Yes, yes.
9527, be careful!
Thank you for your concern, Miss Chou-heung.
9527, what's up? Are you alright?
I am alright.
But, I broke my arm.
You are too careless!
I scare nothing if only I could get back the kite for you.
Just an arm, no big deal.
I am sorry, I shouldn't have blamed you.
Don't talk like this, we may have fault!
No way, no!
Forget it.
Don't go.
Great! We are lovers at last!
Why is he laughing?
Let's see hat is he doing here!
9527, what are you doing? Come down now.
Coming!
Watch out!
Chou-heung, I am coming.
I've got the massage that you have drawn her picture secretly, right?
I have drawn many pictures, which one do you mean?
Look what he has drawn.
How dare you! She is such a pretty woman,
How can you make her so ugly in your picture!
I am sorry, please give it back to me.
You are not gifted in painting, you’d better quit!
I can't help letting you learn from my work.
this is called painting, see!
You are very great in painting!
I admire you so much!
Let's have a look!
You know what is painting now?
You are not only lazy, you dare compete with me for courting girls!
Beat him.
Yes sir.
Stop fighting!
Stop, or I will inform Madam!
Stop!
I am giving face to Miss Chou-heung, let's go.
Go!
Are you dying?
Not yet, I won't die.........
until I give you back the kite, Miss Chou-heung........
Let's go.
Not that easy! You broke our kite, let's beat him to death!
Luckily I tried my best to protect my face,
thus my handsome look hasn't been damaged.
I must tell her how deep I love her.
She will be touched!
Who dares to beat me?
It's me, the most pretty woman, Shek-lau.
It's you? Why did you hit me?
Go to hell!
Why?
Why? Because you deserve it.
Now, everybody knows you have drawn my picture secretly.
How can I face other people? I'd better die.
That's good.
Of course you agree with this suggestion.
for you want to die with me, like Romeo and Juliet.
Damn you, I don't fall for you at all.
Miss Shek-lau, I think you have misunderstood something.
In fact, I respect you so much, I treat you as my mom.
Mom?!
How dare you fall for your mom?!
My God, it's too bad!
But it's too exciting.
Come on, I have never experienced it, I am a little bit nervous.
Come on, hurry up.
Are you crazy?
Don't talk, but do it now.
Don't save your energy because I'm so pretty and civilized.
It's not lucky to meet such a hag!
Good!
Boss!
Boss, we've heard that the 4 maids of Madam Wah are all pretty.
Especially Chou-heung, she is so pretty!
Chou-heung will go to our boss of course.
Sure.
Boss, how about this one? Should we kill him?
No, they are of our kind too.
Just make them faint.
Alright!
I think you are the famous "Four Perverted Heroes".
Yes, we are the famous "Four Perverted Heroes".
Be frank, I am nicked name "Twinkle, tingle little star.............
how I wonder what you are! The Little Wolf", Chow Pak Tung
I haven't heard of your name!
This little wolf is so generous to screw this ugly woman.
How can he reject the name "Little Wolf"?
She is no big deal.
I have tried some girls who were worse than her.
I respect you so much, may I call you "Senior"!
You are flattering me! I’ve heard that you want to screw Chou-heung?
That's right.
If you don't mind, let me bring you to her room.
Do you want to screw her after me?
You first of course.
Thank you.
Clean your shoes, don't leave any marks.
Where is the Little Wolf?
Go get him to lead our way.
Yes sir.
I have got it.
9527, why are you here?
What a big trouble! Some rapists have come for you.
I am scared, what'll we do now?
I have misled their way.
This house is so big, they could hardly get here, why not..............
What's wrong with your nose? It’s bleeding.
It's hurt by the perverted thieves.
It's peanut, no big deal.
In order to save you, I scare nothing.
You'd better hide up first, come with me.
Be safe, let me take a look first.
Never mind, I am fine.
Stop, you are the perverted thief!
Be frank, you can term me as a thief, but not a perverted thief.
You may call me a thief for love.
I won't care what kind of thief you are,
stop playing tricks in front of me.
For that will make me hate you more.
When you find that you are framing me,
you will feel sorrow and regret.
But, you’d better follow me to hide up first.
Get lost.
If there is thief,
why don't you inform Madam, but sneak into here?
Don't think that you can take advantage from innocent girls.
I tell you, it doesn't matter to be poor, but a man should be cultured.
Although you are educated, you are rubbish anyway.
Great! I am a man.
should have beaten you to death after hearing such insulting words.
But I won't do that, maybe you are right.
Maybe I am rubbish.
Maybe more than rubbish.
I have to call you bastard.
Good! I think you hate me so much.
But, why did you give me 3 affectionate smiles?
Did I?
See, you smile affectionately again.
Even though I smiled to you,
it means teasing only, cause you are an idiot.
I see, it's a misunderstanding at all.
I am sorry, I am too stupid to misunderstand your smile.
But, you are really in danger, you’d be careful.
Why are there so many nonsense rubbish in this world!
I wonder, is Tong Pak Fu the only ideal man in this world?
Only a romantic man can write such romantic poem!
"The temple is located inside the peach blossom garden. "
"There is a fairy of peach blossom. "
"The fairy of peach blossom planted the peach blossom trees. "
"She traded the flowers for sweet wine. "
"The people thought I was insane. "
"But they don't really understand me. "
"Can't you see the graves of the heroes?"
"No flowers, no wine, but who cares?"
I love this poem!
Why are you standing there?
You recited the poem of Tong Pak Fu,
in fact, it's a kind of insult.
You are not qualified to recite his poem, get lost now.
Watch out, it's dangerous.
Chou-heung, I understand you at least.
How dare you! You have gone too far.
If you don’t go out, I won't give you face.
Don't push me to use the last stance.
Chou-heung, you are too impulsive.
I shouldn't blame you, you are still young.
But I really love................
"Cross Killing Rod"!
I couldn't help telling you the truth.......
Listen, I am Tong Pak Fu!
Tong Pak Fu?
So?
If you were Tong Pak Fu, I was the Goddess!
Go to hell.
It's so destructive!
Little Wolf, you are really perverted!
Wake up, Senior!
Senior?
Thief! Come out to catch the thieves!
Take her away.
Let me go...
Take her away.
Come out to catch the thieves.
Let me go!
Go..........
Help, hands off!
Go!
Don't move. Surrender now!
You think I'm idiot?
Come on.
Attack!
Mo Chong Yuen, how can these thieves get in?
Madam.
Speak up.
Well.........
Madam, I have seen 9527 staying with these people.
You can't imagine a thief in living in your house.
Take them to the police department.
Go!
I am framed, Madam.
Madam, I have picked up a book from the ground.
Shit.
Whose poetry is it?
I've repeated many times, you can't keep Tong Pak Fu's stuff here.
Whose book is it? Confess now.
Chou-heung, do you know whose book is it?
Madam, I........
Tell me now.
Madam, I know.
Speak up.
It's mine.
If you want to punish, punish me please.
Mo Chong Yuen.
Yes, Madam.
Whom should I punish?
Madam, please punish me.
Fine.
Take him out and chop him into pieces, Then feed our dogs.
Go.......... Go!
Don’t! In fact, I wanted to mislead the thieves to save Chou-heung.
Madam.
I won't care what's the relationship between you and the thieves.
But, you deserve to be killed for keeping the poetry of Tang Yan.
Madam, please listen to my explanation.
What explanation?
Madam, my hometown is Soochow.
I was wealthy.
But, Tong Pak Fu was such a bastard that,
he hooked with the government,
and took away my wealth.
My Grand-dad argued with Tong.
but he was beaten to death,
My Grandma scolded him, but was dragged to Tong's house.
how poor was she, she was raped over 100 times.
She hanged to death at last.
Tong kicked my father and me out of our home.
In order to feed my dad, I became a beggar.
But Tong Pak Fu was too cruel.
He send someone to attack us.
My father and I were beaten terribly.
I am stronger than my dad.
my father thus was beaten to death.
I could never forget this!
In order to bury my father, I have to sell myself.
To save money, and to study at the same time.
I hope to get a degree and gain power in the government.
So that I could take revenge.
that's why I take his poetry with me, to remember him always!
It's too exciting! I couldn't help praising him.
No way, I can't show this out.
But, such feeling is amazing.
Such a touching story!
He sang his story, in the form of rap talk!
It's really interesting but touching!
I am all amazed.
And, about his creativity.
it's rich and powerful! How creative he is!
Yes, I am creative!
I am now full of power!
Thank you,9527
"Damn damn damn, it need shitting after eating"
"Cleaning after shitting"
"Eating after shitting"
"That's life circle!"
Oh, Tong Pak Fu is your enemy!
Yes, Madam.
Madam. look at this man.
I don't think he is useless.
he seems to have been educated.
Now, there is a vacancy in the study room.
Why don't you ask him to serve young masters in schooling time?
Since Chou-heung ask for mercy, I won't kill you.
From now on, I will name you.........
Wah-shington!
I don't think I match this name.
Well, I'I call you Wah On.
Thank you.
Do you want to fight with me for Chou-heung?
I am elder than you, she is mine.
That's nonsense.
Do you want to compete with me?
Go ahead!
Damn you!
How dare you! Go to hell!
How dare you! I want to teach you a lesson!
For Chou-heung, I won't give a damn!
It's lucky to be the servant.
It's within my expectation.
I come closer to Chou-heung.
I am in good mood, very good mood!
Where are the young masters?
Who are you?
I am the servant to serve the schooling of young masters.
Oh, you are the jerk who disturbed my sleep last night.
Right. Oh, you look great!
I am pleased to serve you.
I love this. OK, I will treat you as human being from now on.
Get me the tea.
Sorry, I won't do three things in my life.
What?
I won't serve others tea.
I won't wash the clothes and clean the floor.
I won't tidy my bed.
You are talking about our living habits.
What do you know then?
I know..........
playing all kinds of music!
I know fortune telling too.
I am keen in courting women too.
Really?
Show us something now.
I don't think it's convenient to demonstrate right here.
I think you are bluffing.
If you are great in fortune telling, tell something about us.
Shit, I don't think you are capable of telling anything.
If I am correct, you must be..........
mentally retarded.
You are great to tell the truth.
I admire you so much!
May I call you Brother?
I don't mind, from now on, bring me tea and tidy my bed.
Wah Man, Wah Mo, why do you kneel on the ground?
We are greeting him as our brother.
How can you be their brother?
It's just a joke, please forgive me.
No, Wah On, we will follow you.
Youth.
How dare you recruit my fellows to your party? Who are you?
May I know your name?
May I know your name first?
No, may I know your name?
No, may I know your name first?
I have to know your name first.
I will tell you my name after knowing your name.
I won't tell you my name unless you tell me yours first.
No way, I came from San Shui.
I am the teacher of Wah's family.
Who are you?
I came from Soochow, I am a little servant in Wah's family.
That's all about me.
How dare you!
Do you know how powerful I am?
I will kill if there is anything blocking my way!
Man, Mo.
Sir, what are you doing?
What's wrong with you?
Dad, you killed teacher accidentally.
Congratulation, you killed him!
No. No!
I saw teacher asking God to adhere him, he thought he was invincible.
But, he failed, So he stabbed himself to death.
Isn't it correct?
Yes, it's fact.
Men, take the corpse out.
Yes.
Who are you?
He is Wah On, he accompanies us in studying.
Yes, dad.
Wah On, you helped me a lot
I want to promote you to e Senior Studying Companion.
You're responsible to educate them, got it?
Thank you, Your Excellency.
Wah On, go ahead.
Come on!
Hurry up.
Wah On, come on, just like that night you did.
OK, listen to me.
Fine.
"Wah On has 2 eyes"
"3 ladies....
have 6 tits"
You're disgusting.
What's on?
Wah On is telling dirty jokes.
Yeah!
Miss Chou-heung.
Wah On, are you fooling others?
Nothing, I am reciting poems.
What kind of poem? The poem of Tong Pak Fu?
Of course not, Tong Pak Fu is my enemy.
You can't cheat me!
But, you are great in making such interesting story in limited time.
Miss Chou-heung, you are really wise.
But why did you impersonate Tong Pak Fu on that night?
Guess.
I know, you must know Tong Pak Fu.
Of course.
Can you introduce him to me?
I am Tong Pak Fu.
Stop kidding, I mean it.
Everybody knows Tong Pak Fu, he is born to be wild!
But, he doesn't know me.
I think you misunderstand Tong Pak Fu.
Wild is his outlook.
but from his poems.
I can tell he is a man of passion, a righteous man.
What are you doing?
I am touched to cry.
You are q great observer.
If Tong has had a friend like you, he wouldn't have any regrets.
You are lying.
Miss Chou-heung.
What do you think about me?
I think you....
are a fool.
Miss Chou-heung.
Are you willing to study poems and songs
with this fool at midnight in front of the willow?
Fine
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
Damn!
Chou-heung, Tong Pak Fu is caught by our security Mo Chong Yuen.
Help!
Shut up.
Why?
I met this guy in the market, he claimed himself to be Tong Pak Fu.
He was selling Tong Pak Fu's paintings.
So, I caught him here for you, Madam.
It's the painting of Tong Pak Fu.
I am framed, I am not Tong Pak Fu.
If you were not Tong, why did you have so many paintings of him?
I stole them while Tong Pak Fu wasn't at home.
You said you were not Tong Pak Fu.
Who are you then?
I am Chuck Chi Shan. I swear!
Don't you confess?
Tung Heung.
Yes.
Fine, Tung-heung, ask Wah One to come here.
I want him to identify his enemy Tong Pak Fu.
Yes, Madam.
Wah On?!
Madam.
What's the matter?
I talked too much yesterday, my muscle was hurt.
Go and identify this guy, tell me isn't he Tong Pak Fu.
Yes
Oh, it's you.
How can you recognize me?
I know you of course, you are Tong...
Right, I am the one whom Tong wanted to kill!
If you don't want to be killed, you’d better shut up.
Madam, since Tong Pak Fu always masked when he did bad things.
So, I am not very sure.
Well, don't miss any chance.
Kill him.
Hold it!
he should be Tong Pak Fu's somebody.
So, why not let him alive, maybe we can get Tong by using him.
Well, I can let him alive, but with severe punishment.
Shek-lau, lock him up in the storeroom
Torture him as you like.
Thank you, Madam.
What do you want?
Bring him in.
Don't touch me, I am still a virgin.
I am damn lucky to enjoy so much.
Mr. Tong, do you want to kill me so as to keep your secret?
Shut up, you'd better run for your life.
No, I don't want to leave.
for I have good food here.
and I have screwed a wonderful woman.
Are you kidding?
I mean it, for I owe the load sharks much money.
this is the best place for me to hide up.
You..........
Someone is coming
Are you alright?
What's the matter? Miss Chou-heung.
Are you Tong Pak Fu?
Why do you ask me this question?
Be frank, I admire Tong Pak Fu so much.
I want to see him.
Please tell me are you Tong Pak Fu or not.
Right, I am Tong Pak Fu.
What kind of noise is it?
It's the noise of the beast.
Shut up.
Chou-heung, it's destiny for us to meet, we may have a long talk.
May I ask you a question?
Sure, but to show you are sincere enough,
you have to answer me a question first.
Close your eyes first.
Relax.
Put your head on my left shoulder.
Don't be nervous, don't you trust me?
Relax, let your face touch mine, slowly.........
Right, good girl.
I could stand no more.
Kid, I am coming.
Somebody is coming
Miss, who are you?
Don't you remember me? You've just screwed me!
I am civilized, what are you talking about?
Damn, you tried very hard just then.
But, there was no third party.........
What? I won't care, I want to play a game with you now.
The beauty and the beast!
I know Tong Pak Fu now.
Wah On is even better than him.
Thank you, Miss Chou-heung.
Why are you here?
I come to watch something. How about you?
Me too.
Let's watch together.
This is great.
Really? Look!
Don't you think I am nothing?
Once more.
Give way, give way..........
Your Excellency, King Ning is coming with a troop.
Noney, Ning always goes against you.
In the government meeting, you are the political enemy of him.
He brings a troop here.
I am afraid he is having some tricks.
We should be careful!
Here comes King Ning.
Please.
How are you?
Thank you for visiting us.
I have heard that you love Chinese painting very much.
I tried very hard to find some paintings of Tong Pak Fu for you.
Your Majesty.
Cut the crap.
Bring me the paintings.
Yes.
It's really sanctuary! Nice pictures.
Really? It's so great!
I have re-mounted it.
Look at the king of the birds, it seems to be alive.
It's really the King of the birds.
How can I accept such precious gift.
If you don't accept it, you are not giving me face.
Don't you want me to lose my temper?
Don't get angry.
I do want to have a look of the painting too.
Since you love paintings too, let's have a look.
Chou-heung, come and take a look.
Yes, Madam.
This is the "Peacock", painted by Tong Yan.
But peacock is an ordinary bird at all.
Even you re-mount it, it doesn't help.
For an ordinary bird won't become phoenix at all.
Your majesty, please forgive her.
She is so green in studying painting, please forgive her ignorance.
Your Majesty, since they are experts in studying Tong's paintings.
I think they have kept some better paintings of Tong Yan here.
You are right.
Madam, why no show me the paintings of Tong Yan?
Be frank, we don't have any Tong's paintings.
Damn, you are fooling Our Majesty.
Your Excellency.
Your Majesty, but Tong Pak Fu is now living in our guest room.
Chou-heung, please lead Tong Pak Fu here.
Yes, Madam.
Madam, here comes Tong Pak Fu.
Tong Pak Fu, I want you to draw a picture of phoenix for His Majesty.
I want to know how nice is your phoenix!
If you can't draw a nice phoenix, you may be killed!
Tong Pak Fu, draw it now.
It's done.
Look, this is the Holy Phoenix.
Kidding! It’s a chick instead.
Something is missing.
A circle right here.
See, it is holy then?
Damn, how dare you fool me!
Thank you, Your Majesty, I always suspect that he isn't Tong at all.
Now, we've found out the truth from his painting.
Drag him out.
Yes.
I have heard that you are great in writing poems.
my consultant wants to learn something from you.
No. the others will tease Our Excellency of bullying your staff.
Right.
We won't count ranking in literature studying.
Just for fun, if you don't accept this challenge, I'll lose my temper.
Start the distich race.
"A for apple B for boy. C for cat and D for dog"
"E for egg and G for girl"
Come on, answer this, aren't you giving me face?
Or, I will lose my temper! Don’t make me angry.
Please let me try.
"Doe a deer, Ray, a drop of golden sun"
"Me a name I call myself, far a long long way to run"
Great distich!
Wah On, you come in time!
It's alright. Don't worry.
I am the consultant of His Majesty.
I am called "The Number One distich writer" Tu Chuen Chang
I have studied for 2 years, I am a servant here, called Wah On.
Let me play with you.
Sorry, we can't control ourselves.
By the way, let's start now.
"in the picture, the dragons and tigers won't roar"
"in the chess, the horses and the generals can't fight"
Bravo.........
"An A, a bee, a C and a D"
"An E, an F, a G and an H",
You are a good distich writer!
Excellent!
Raise another distich.
"See a jerk standing over there"
"Here(hear) a bastard sitting before me"
Excellent!
"I am hero in the battle field"
"You are chicken in bed instead"
I can't lose face in front of a small potato!
"Let's plant the trees together"
"For the grave of your father"
"My grandma has prepared the supper"
"My God-father has screwed your grandma"
Writing distich is for fun only.
But, why are you hurt in playing this game?
I wonder how powerful the words are!
Wah On, go back to clean your floor.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Your Majesty, forgive my little servant.
He stopped you from losing your temper.
Fine, Evil Scholar.
Bring the painting which is fated by the emperor to show Mr. Wah
Yes.
Let's watch it together.
Please catch the painting.
Watch out.
It's not convenient to look right here, let's go over there.
Such precious painting, you’d better keep it carefully.
We've plenty of time!
Is Madam in danger?
Let's go to take a look.
OK, let's go.
Madam, how are you?
What's the matter?
I won't tell you.
Miss Chou-heung.
I was punched 3 times.
How ugly!
I was beaten 8 times.
Someone is uglier than me at last!
Miss Chou-heung, what's happening?
I was hurt over 30 times.
Ghost!
Ghost!
Is she Chou-heung?
Yes, she was seriously beaten.
Isn't she hurt by the most horrible.........
Yes, she is hurt by the "Faceless Kick".
Damn! She was kicked by me, I shouldn't have been scared by her.
Miss Chou-heung.
What have I done just then?
You were hurt by the most horrible "Faceless Kick”, you’re in danger.
Luckily, I have saved you with.........
"Beauty Fist", to make you return to normal look, you are fine now.
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
Wah On, there is something missed.
See, my maxilla.
Use more force.
Chou-heung, you look more beautiful!
Madam!
Mr. Wah, I am so kind to show you the painting.
But why did you tear it?
Pleas don't get angry, I don't mean it.
Cut the crap. you ruin the royal treasure.
I will report to His Majesty, I think, he will execute your whole family!
Wait!
About the painting "Spring and Autumn" you've just presented.
I don't think it's the real one!
How dare you fool me?
It's given by the emperor, how can it be fake?
Men, I am going to lose my temper.
Hold it, in fact, the real "Spring and Autumn" is kept here.
It's always kept in our house.
If you don't believe, let me show you.
Chou-heung, follow me.
Your Majesty.
Fine, I want to know what you are going to show me.
You'll be in deep shit later.
Wah On, what are you doing?
How can we have the "Spring and Autumn" drawn by Tong Pak Fu?
What'll we do now?
Chou-heung, please bring me the ink.
No way, we have no choice, but get me the ink.
What?
Get me some ink.
I have to draw it by my memory.
But, it's hard to imitate the painting of Tong Pak Fu.
I hope King Ning would be cheated.
Impossible! How can Ning be cheated by my drawing?
Wah On, you have made a big trouble.
You will be killed, and it will drag our family to death!
I think you'd better leave.
Nobody is outside, go now.
Is it painted by you?
Yes, I earned my living by imitating the drawing of Tong Yan.
I have imitated this "Spring and Autumn" over 100 times.
Hope it can save us.
This is for living, so I have to carry it.
How can you draw so fast?
It's slow indeed.
This is the painting by Tong Pak Fu.
How can you claim this be true, what proof do you have?
Why not ask an expert to check it?
Tu Chuen Chang.
Are you still alive? If yes, come to check this picture.
Is it OK?
Take a risk.
This is really drawn by Tong Yan.
Kidding? Impossible.
Look carefully!
It's true, but, it's rather wet.
Since the weather is misty, so it's wet.
Yes, it's misty.
You may die now.
Your Majesty, you are too careless.
How can you be cheated!
If the emperor knows it is stolen because of your carelessness.
You may be punished, but we are friends, take this as my regard.
Keep it safely! Or it may be stolen.
Your Majesty, we'd better leave, he's difficult to handle.
Fine, let's go.
Hold it.
You said you wanted to lose your temper
Forget?
Good, I show you.
Are you scared?
Why didn't you kill them?
The little servant is not simple.
I was almost trapped.
Your Kung-fu is most powerful in the world, isn't it?
Why are you scared by a little servant?
Your Majesty, since my sword is powerful.
I am afraid it would hurt you.
You lost my face.
Your Majesty, I swear.
3 days later, after I have recovered, I will take a revenge for you.
To kill Mr. Wah.
And his wife, Madam Wah.
And the servant.
And Chou-heung.
Anyway.
Kill Wah's family.
Yes, Sir!
Brother, don't you feel comfortable?
Quite good.
Brother, you have a stance called "Beauty fist".
can you beat us with this Kung-fu to make us handsome?
Yes, please beat us.
But you are too handsome!
But I don't mind being more handsome.
Give me some tea please.
Kidding? How can you talk like this?
It's our duty to serve you!
How can you mention the word "Please"?
"Don't you take us as your fellows?
The word "Please" will disappoint us.
And it will drive us crazy, if so, I may shit on your body........
I wonder, the word "Please" could make you shit on my body.
Stop laughing, I'm serious.
I understand, you jerks, bring me some tea.
I love that, brother!
Thank you brother.
Mom.
Where are you going to?
To get some tea.
Get out, I have something to talk to Wah On.
Yes.
Please be seated.
After you, Madam.
Wah On, you achieved a lot for us.
Here is a cup of ginseng tea, drink it, its nutritious.
Wah On.
Thank you, Miss Chou-heung.
You're welcome, drink it while it's still hot.
You are educated, I think you'd be recruited by the government.
But why did you serve in our house?
Madam, I don't care about any vacancy in the government.
Anyway, Madam and Miss Chou-heung treat me so nice that
I wish I could stay in Wah's house forever.
What a wonderful scholar.......
Tong Pak Fu!
Are you talking to me?
Stop pretending, from your Kung-fu and poems.
I have guessed something.
Although I hate your family so much, you saved me yesterday.
I am so cultured that, I won't harm you.
Just confess!
I am not, but even if I say yes.
I can't help if you really want to harm me.
Do you understand what I am talking about?
Yes, I do, but you have to confess one day.
Make it tomorrow.
You are so cocky!
So what?
Fine, I want to marry Chou-heung to you if only you confess........
Madam
Are you kidding? You should keep your promise.
Right, I am the wise and handsome hero........
Tong Pak Fu.
Madam.
You are nosy.
Madam, you..........
I didn't keep my promise, so what? I want you to die now.
Hey, please keep calm, no weapons please.
Are you begging me?
Tong Tin Ho, you heartless guy, I couldn't kill you.
but I want to kill your son so as to avenge my broken heart.
Don't blame me of being frank.
How can you kill me with such snacks?
Are you kidding?
I tell you, the ginseng tea you have drunk........
is poisoned, which is called the "Greatest Drug in the World"
What? How can you claim this the greatest drug in the world?
How about my "Tong's Killing Pill"?
Bullshit, "Greatest Drug in the World" is made by 7 poisoned insects.
Plus Hok Tin Hung, under 49 days processing.
It's tasteless and colorless, no one can stay alive after taking this.
My "Tong's Killing Powder" is made by honey and plycodonis.
Plus the Lotus from Tin Shan.
No freezing, no preservative ingredient is added
It's a powerful poison.
And it tastes good too.
You will lose your Kung-fu after taking my drugs.
And your blood will go in opposite direction until death.
At last, you will explode to death.
Right, after eating my "Tong's Killing Pill",
you can't move even one step, and you can't smile.
Or your whole body will explode.
It's so convenient.......
to kill a person.
And it's easy to carry too.
Where is it sold?
You are lucky, I have got one here.
I don't think it's powerful.
No, my pill is most powerful.
Kidding, you are bluffing!
Don't you trust me? Do you dare to take one?
Don't you think I daren't take it?
I don't think you dare to take it.
OK, I will take it.
Go ahead.
Alright.
Eat this.
How dare you challenge me?
Go ahead if you have guts.
I have guts of course, watch me.
Eat this.
Eat!
Don't you think I am idiot? Eat this?
Eat this.
You are not stupid.
But you are very stupid.
Now, we are all poisoned, why not exchange the antidotes?
Damn you, are you threatening me?
Madam, it's not worth to take risk, your life is precious.
Men, lock him up in the store room, let him die there.
Yes.
Madam, please be merciful.
Cut the crap.
Damn, I don't think his poison could kill me.
Worse to worse, I won't smile and I won't walk.
Chou-heung.
Shut up.
I have stolen many antidotes from Madam's exercise room.
See which kin can save you.
I appreciate so much for you to take risk for Wah On.
No Wah On again.
In fact, when you draw the picture of Tong, I've known your identity.
I can't imagine you would confess your identity!
Chou-heung, for what I have done, it's for...........
I want to ask you a question, please answer me.
What is it?
Is Tang Pak Fu your nick name?
No, why do you ask this question?
Pak Fu, Pak Fool, it's really funny!
If you don't want to answer me, just forget it.
Thank you.
What color do you like?
Many, say yellow.
Yelow? This color?
Yes.
That's why you always tail after me.
Other than drawing, what hobbies do you have?
Nothing special, just listen to music or flute playing.
You know playing flute! That's great!
Sure.
Really?
Let me teach you some time.
Fine.
You are the leading scholar of the "Four Scholars",
Have you felt any pressure?
Good question, about pressure, it's great.
so I always have a trip to lessen my pressure.
I understand.
Did you invent the "Tong's Killing Pill"?
Kidding! That’s what I fooled Madam Wah.
You are cunning!
Have you found the antidote?
Not here.
So unlucky!
I want to ask you one question. do you scare ghost?
Tong Pak Fu is disgusting to make me jump for few days.
Madam, since you are not poisoned, why not set Tong free?
Chou-heung, if you were not the maid I like most,
I would have kicked you out of my home.
Don't mention Tong Pak Fu again.
Madam.
Get out of here.
I have followed you for years.
You treat me so good.
I can't repay that in my life.
I'd be blamed.........
for I beg you to let Tong go!
I wish to be punished on behalf of Tong!
How dare you!
Chou-heung.
If madam doesn't premise me, I won't get up.
Madam.
I won't change my mind.
Madam!
What are you doing?
We are like sisters.
Please let Tong go, for the sake of Chou-heung.
Tung-heung.
Please, we beg you.
What do you mean?
Men, drag them out.
Madam.
Mo Chong Yuen, where have you gone?
How dare you mess up here!
Wah dares to offend Our Majesty.
you were lucky last time.
but I won't let you go now, I want to kill your whole family.
You are not qualified to mess up here.
Tung-heung, inform Mr. Wah now.
Go.
What's the matter?
Follow me.
What'd happened?
The Evil Scholar comes to kill.
Evil Scholar?
You'd better go, it's dangerous out there.
How about you?
Forget about me, go!
Chou-heung.
Madam is my benefactor, I'd stay with her whatever'd happened.
Open the door first.
Wah On.
I love you.
What did you say? Chou-heung!
Go and help!
Where are you going?
Chou-heung, ask Wah On to help us.
Only Wah On could help.
Wah On has left.
He is not righteous enough.
Dad, mom has left, let's run for our lives.
OK.
Madam.
Madam.
What's wrong with you?
Madam.
Wah On?
He is Tong Pak Fu.
Be careful! You are poisoned.
Don't worry, I have got the antidote from your exercise room.
And I took little time to take a bath and get changed.
"Evil Scholar”, you trapped my dad in the duel.
I wonder, can you defeat me too?
Oh, you are the son left by that poor fellow.
That's why you're familiar!
I have to avenge my dad now.
Tong's Spear should be the number one on the weapon list.
Watch mine.
Your dad is stupid, so are you! Why did you stab with no head?
But it's powerful too!
I have made it powerful although no head is found.
Pal, don't you think it's worth to be killed by me?
From now on, our Tong's Spear is the champion on the weapon list.
Wah On, are you alright?
I am fine, how about you?
Great, I am so glad you came in time.
Tong Pak Fu, I have to thank you for saving our family.
How can I reward you?
You are welcome, I have only one request.
I know it, you love Chou-heung, right?
I will marry her to you.
Bravo!
Why are there so many brides?
Tong, although I promise to marry Chou-heung to you, but,
on one condition
Choose Chou-heung among the brides.
Wah Man.
You should find her out before the incense is burnt.
On the following conditions
1st. stand behind the yellow line.
2nd. the brides can't make any noise.
3rd. don't use anything to touch the brides
That's all.
If you can't find Chou-heung in limited time, then you'll lose.
Then Chou-heung will marry my sons.
Brother, we are on the waiting list.
Don't blame us.
Madam, please don't fool me.
Mr Tong, why do you say so?
In such conditions, how can I choose Chou-heung?
Be frank, I love Chou-heung whole-heartedly.
Why do you fool me?
Tong Pak Fu, you said you were poor.
You were willing to sell yourself to be our servants.
And there is a contract too.
But, infact you come here for courting Chou-heung.
