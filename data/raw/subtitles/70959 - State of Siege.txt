AUGUST
In Latin America, it is wintertime.
Confirmed seven cars.
There's the eighth. Over.
Plaza de Garibaldi. Nothing.
379, I read you.
Still nothing.
Confirmed. Over.
This is car 52.
Sector 7 control.
Request schedule.
Confirmed. Over.
Forget the schedule. Continue.
Get all the vehicles,
one by one.
379, I read you.
Patrol 25
calling Headquarters.
- This is Headquarters.  Do you read me?
- Yes.
Headquarters
to Patrol 25. Go ahead.
Apparent age:50 years.
Dark eyes, fat.
I think that he is an American,
Philip Michael Santore.
White hair, impregnated with a coloured substance.
He was in a car that was stolen yesterday.
It is a Cadillac 251798.
Second projectile:9 millimeters with copper casing.
Entrance wound:abdomen, left side.
Rising trajectory, slightly oblique,
hitting the intestine,
the stomach,
the diaphragm, the heart,
right ventricle, the aorta.
I see another wound, inflicted
shortly before death
a gunshot, perfectly dressed,
well-healed.
The Chamber has been summoned
in an emergency meeting
in order to consider declaring a
day of national mourning.
Present deputies:103.
Absentees with justification:12.
Absentees without justification:32.
Having reached the quorum,
the session is open.
The Government proposes
the following decree:
Article One:It is decreed
that today is a day of national mourning
on the occasion of the death
of Philip Michael Santore,
civil employee of the A.I.D.
and citizen of the United States.
Therefore,
public services,
the schools,
the banks and stock-market
must stop all activity.
Article Two:
The funeral will be paid for
by the State.
Who votes against?
Who votes in favor?
It's unanimous.
The Presidency invites the Assembly to keep a minute's silence
in honor of Mister
Philip Michael Santore.
"... when, suddenly,
two men
dressed in white
appeared, and said:
"Town of Galilea,  why do you
stand watching the sky?
This Jesus that has been taken
from you
will return in the same way
that you have seen him going to heaven."
We speak to you directly
from the cathedral,
where the funeral is being held
to commemorate the death
of Philip Michael
Santore. Overwhelmed with grief,
Mrs. Santore is surrounded
by her older children.
The youngest still doesn't know
that his father has died.
They attend the ceremony
the Council
of Ministers,
the heads of all
the Armed Forces of the country
and all of the
Diplomatic Corps.
It's a shock to observe that the seats
assigned to the priests
and to the university bodies
are empty.
We hoped that the Archbishop
would pronounce
the funeral oration,
but we see now
that it has been delegated to
the Papal Nuncio.
The Archbishop does not attend
the ceremony.
"We implore his eternal rest,
he was a husband
and an affectionate father,
We beg the eternal one
to reward him for being
an innocent victim
and a martyr.
Philip Michael Santore
knew misery
and dedicated his life to fighting it.
And he was able to save
many young people,
turning them
in decent citizens.
"This fallen victim
of terrorism
and of violence,
of this sudden action
and fatal violence ,
of this fury
that blinds and murders
that, from last Monday,
has returned to afflict
to our city.
MONDAY
The keys to your car,
please.
Come with us.
Quickly.
Lady, please.
Yes?
But what...?
- What's happening?
- Tupamaros.
We need this car.
We are armed.
Open the door.
Expropriation.
Move over.
No, this can't be true!
Again?
- Ah, we've already had you...?
- Yes, you've already had me
To rob the Chase Manhattan bank.
The expropriation...
And today, what is it?
He'll read it tomorrow
in newspapers.
Same as us
Police.
- We need this car.
- Yes, Sir.
We need this van
for a job.
Don't make a noise
Tupamaros?
With me you do not need that.
But I want to say something...
I do not agree
with your methods,
speaking politically.
And in practice?
Right now?
Which way?
- That way or that way?
- That way.
Hello.
We are armed.
- What do you want now?
- We're going for a ride.
You know this?
You will be able to report the robbery
to the police.
And the van?
The police will find it
today or tomorrow. You know this.
- We are going to return.it
- Yes, I know already
A walk and soon I report
it to the the police.
Be careful with the brakes.
And second gear is bad.
The keys!
Shit!
- Who is it?
- Telephone company.
There he is.
- What do we do?
- Take a look
They are just ahead.
We'll carry you
- It is not necessary.
- That's not true
- I can walk.
- We prefer otherwise
- It is for your security,  no?
- Exactly.
- There he is.
- Yes, he's there.
Mr. Minister, what do
you think of this kidnapping?
What does the
United States think?
Mr. Minister?
Do you think this act
will embarrass the country?
Do you think they'll ask for a rescue?
Or to free
the political prisoners?
There are no political prisoners
in our country!
Only common criminals that rob banks
and steal cars,
they kill police
and they kidnap people.
A photo.
Hasn't our complicity benefitted
terrorists?
Brazil is concentrating troops
on the border.
Is this a coincidence?
An official communiqué will
answer your questions
... morning that has ended
with the kidnapping
of Fernando Campos,
Consul of Brazil,
Anthony Lee, Secretary
of the embassy of the USA
and Philip Michael Santore,
citizen of the USA.
and official of the A.I.D.
in our country.
Mr. Anthony Lee
has been able to escape.
Any questions?
Do you believe the government, and in particular
the Minister of the Interior,
is going to take measures
in order to confront a situation
that has already lasted six years
and has become intolerable
- Intolerable for the government.
- For the country!
It is the government
that is intolerable for the country.
The Exceptional Powers law
was invoked
in agreement with Article 168
of the Constitution.
It only has to last 60 days,
it was invoked with that condition.
The 60 days lasted
for more than 2 years.
That law continues being
the instrument with which
we handle the situation
with responsibility
- According to you, the Tupamaros...
- That word is prohibited
by the law. We offer you
our hospitality.
Respect our laws.
We call them
the "innumberables".
They're terrorists!
Excuse me
I only wanted to say that,
according to the communiqué
more than a hundred
"innumerables"
participated in the operation.
But the information,
the testimonies
speak of a maximum of ten
for each kidnapping.
Ten by three:thirty.
What makes up the 70 others?
It is not only a technical question
it has to also do
with the space,
that is to say, the political
effect of the organization.
I do not see how criminals
can have
a political influence.
Please, Mr. Lucas...
Those... "terrorists"
they have tried to kidnap
the second secretary
of the American Embassy.
And that makes sense,
from their point of view, clear.
Also the kidnapping
of the Consul of Brazil
obeys a certain logic, but...
that Mister... Santore,
Philip Michael Santore...
Why?
He is not an official personage.
Nothing, under no notion,
could we impute
direct or indirect responsibility
None of us
knew of his existence...
So who really is
this Mister Santore,
and what did he do in our country?
Mr. Santore is one of
civil employees of our Agency.
What are its
functions, exactly?
We have multiple
activities.
We intervene in the different sectors
of industry that exist here
we are interested
in agriculture, mining,
education,
the forest industry
and scientific research.
In Latin America,
we cooperate
with the Alliance for Progress,
but we also work
in all the free
countries
that ask for the economic and technical
assistance of the USA.
by sending them American
technicians. Is that right?
Yes. Mostly,
because they have
the necessary qualifications.
But also we were in charge
of the training of local technicians.
In fact,
It allows them, and they
allow a foreign government,
to control all the country, to know
its resources, its wealth...
We cannot know
its problems
without the aid of specialists,
nor to help them to solve them.
- I would say the opposite.
- That is to say?
That is a detail...
but it's USA
which needs assistance
and not these other countries.
At least, that's how I
see things.
It's paradoxical...
The precision.
When drinking beer,
taking an aspirin,
washing the teeth,
cooking in an
aluminum pot,
using a refrigerator
or heating a room
every day,
my fellow citizens contribute
to the development of your economy.
That contribution takes
all its significance
when we enter
the military domain.
But I do not want to
waste your time
We spoke of that gentleman...
of that Mister Santore.
Someday we will speak
of the aid
in order to settle it
once and for all.
I agree totally. Well...
that Mister Santore...
What were...
what were his functions
within A.I.D.?
In what type of activities
did he specialise?
In communications.
He was a specialist, an expert.
Is that him?
That's him.
It's when the Alliance
for Progress
They gave 300 cars
to the police,  no?
Yes.
So they also look after
our police?
There is...
an official agreement
between both governments.
Yes, I understand ... yes.
And...  Mister Santore
worked here?
In this building?
No
The A.I.D has...
it has premises
in the Police Headquarters.
The A.I.D collaborates
with our police
in order to improve the forces
of public order,
for security in questions of traffic,
for communications and other
administrative problems.
And that Mister Santore...
Spent a year working
here, true?
Yes, more or less.
And before that?
He came from the United States?
No he was in other
Latin American countries
Always with A.I.D.?
Yes, as communications expert.
Do you know those countries?
What?
Do you know those Latin American
countries?
I believe, among others,
the Dominican Republic and Brazil.
So, Mr. Santore,
before coming to our country,
was also in Brazil.
During the military coup.
You got that wrong
I arrived two years before,
in '62.
It takes time to prepare
In Latin America no.
In the USA
you are quicker.
In seconds,
you'll assassinate a President.
You were in Brazil
as an advisor
before, during
and after the coup d'etat.
Exactly. Based on an agreement
between my Government and the Brazillians.
- The democratic government of Goulart.
- Yes.
In '64, Goulart is overthrown
by the military,
they suppress the Parliament,
the parties,
press freedom,
the unions.
You stay there,
- The agreements were still in effect
- I know.
Johnson even congratulated them
hours before the coup.
Political necessity.
And for the moral aspect,
Cardinal Spelmann sent
his blessing.
God is an American
and takes part in coups.
And you?
I don't take part in politics,
I'm a technician.
Police technician
- Exactly.
- And the police defend order.
Exactly.
The democratic order,
or the order of the dictatorship?
Yes, I know
what that means
and that it can be
contradictory,
but try to put yourself
in my place.
I am a technician in traffic
and communications,
those are problems of democracies
and of the dictatorships.
These are technical problems, naturally.
Naturally.
They consider an interrogation
to be a technical problem.
If that's what you are doing
And if it doesn't get results?
Torture can be a technique
that solves the problem
of interrogation.
Ever heard talk
of torture in Brazil?
Of the "parrot's perch"?
Of effective methods,
of "hydraulics"?
Of electroshocks?
Do you know those methods?
No. What are you talking about?
Techniques.
Do you know that
torture happens in Brazil.
It is an immense country, unbalanced and with
a tradition of violence.
Excesses can be committed,
isolated cases. It is probable.
Where they torture children
so that the parents speak?
I have read about such things
in communist newspapers.
The bishops that denounced them are
also communist?
Who knows...
In Sao Paulo,
in Belo Horizontey,
in Guanabara, Pernambuco,
torture classes happen,
with practical exercises
using live subjects.
And you, the advisor to the Brazilian police,
never knew anything?
No
Almost all of the
police force
has been formed by you
and your colleagues.
The "New York Times" said that.
Not communists.
That's a typical connection of yours
I've not yet had anything to do with it.
Do you know these people?
Not as far as I know.
And these?
No, I don't think so
Are they Brazilians?
With respect to this one,
undoubtedly.
In effect.
Well...
Do you remember them?
Yes, it was two or three years ago.
The watch must do the talking now.
"A souvenir from your Brazilian friends".
Are they?
No, it is an official gift to A.I.D.
They represented the military command.
That is, to the military police.
Probably.
But they aren't my friends.
They've been denounced
as torturers.
By the Bishops?
By their victims.
And also by the Bishops.
They are many coincidences.
You believe in coincidences?
Generally, no.
Well. That's enough for today.
Smoke?
Thanks.
Would you like to drink something?
Whiskey?
- Here only we have water.
- I'll need some anyway.
What's happening?
It's a general alert.
What's with the wound?
Is he hurt?
A little.
- It is strange, is bearable.
- It was an accident.
Yes.
Lots of nerves and little experience.
Perhaps too young...
Breathe.
Stronger.
The young doctor who treated me
thinks that the lung is not affected.
We'll have to take an X-ray
In order to be sure.
You're not worried. You'll understand later.
I'm not worred. I've a good
reason for that.
I trust his intelligence
I think you also know
your job well
I'm not so sure,
looking at the situation
It is Dolotal.
To make you sleep
Well, it happens.
Watch out, cover yourselves.
The new man must abandon
materialism
in order to return to the spiritual.
Pope Leon XIII,
in his "Rerum Novarum"...
He condemned the liberalism that caused the industrial
revolution and originated
the greed for money.
I do not condemn anything, I ask for
return to the Christian civilization,
to the principles
of the Gospel,
to the love of ones fellows.
To forget materialism,
money.
Our aims are almost
the same, mister consul.
But we asked you
about the extremists
and the Brazilian police
whether they collaborate with those here
with, for example,
the "death squads".
I don't know what he's talking about
But you belong to the organisation "Tradition,
Family, Property "?
Here no, in Brazil.
Here I'm not political
Whoever is a fascist
in his country
is a fascist everywhere
Not, here I'm not...
I only represent
the interests of my government.
Really there's no contradiction.
What have they done to you?
What did they want?
To speak.
Have they tortured you?
We only spoke.
What did they say?
They want... to kill to us,  right?
I don't think so.
Those are not their methods.
And they take too many precautions.
You were also transported by stretcher?
Yes, yes.
Yes, good.
The stretchers,the padded walls,
the newspapers, the hoods...
They don't want
us to recognize them,
or the place.
It is clear that you have a future.
No, it is not true.
I know it,
they've let me know
They want to kill me.
I don't know why.
I... I never...
I have done anything bad.
Is a crime to be
Brazilian diplomat?
I take care of my family,
of my work...
What can they accuse me of?
Perhaps not you...
- Who, then?
- Your government.
What do they blame my government for?
The tortures, for example.
Papers, please.
Those of the patient
and the the young lady also.
- Are you Dr Sanchez?
- Yes.
What happened to him?
A heart attack.
It's serious.
It is possible he can be saved
if we arrive in time.
I'm sorry, I'm carrying out orders.
What hospital did they take him to?
To Santa Maria.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Dr Francia.
Emergency.
A poisoning.
TUESDAY:We've just received
the following communiqué
in relation to both diplomats kidnapped yesterday.
Communiqué of the national
liberation movement
"Commando Liber Arce".
The foreign nationals
that we have captured,
Fernando Campos,
Consul of Brazil
and Philip Michael Santore,
citizen of the USA
and A.I.D. official,
whom the police and the army
are hunting for and will not find,
are detained in the people's prison
The health of the Consul of Brazil
is satisfactory.
The American civil employee
was hurt during the action
by a gunshot.
The diagnosis is the following one:
bullet wound entering to the
right of the breastbone
and exiting in
the left auxillary region.
His pleuropulmonary system is
normal.
There is no evidence
of pneumo-hemothorax.
There is no cardiovascular damage,
normal heart and pulse.
Another communiqué will be distributed later
We continue the interrogation
of the prisoners...
And after Brazil,
you left
for the Dominican Republic in 1965.
You're well informed.
In April 1965, marines
invaded the island.
And you?
I do not agree with the term "invade".
But to be brief,
I arrived later, in May.
Always on behalf
of the A.I.D.?
Yes.
Communications, traffic.
Exactly.
Mr. Santore...
in May 1965,
the Dominican Republic
was in civil war.
On the one hand,
the constitutionalists.
On the other, the
civil and military junta
created, armed, financed by the C.I.A
and supported by 40,000 marines.
And you were there
to take care of traffic?
Exactly
What type of traffic?
Tanks?
The A.I.D was there due
to international agreements.
We reorganized the police
and we restored order.
- What type of order?
- Civil order.
That is, against the chaos,
robberies and looting.
You mean the order
of the United Fruit Company
and the other Yankee companies
in Latin America?
We inevitably end up
speaking of politics.
Inevitably.
You stayed there two years, yes?
Yes, from '65 to '67.
During that period they killed
hundreds of democrats,
political leaders
and unionists.
An international commission
blamed those murders
on the police.
And you were there in order to
reorganize it?
There were many international
commissions in the Dominican Republic
- Coincidence.
- Luckily, you don't believe in it
Yes. When they are repeated,
I think.
We analyzed them
as objective facts
Would you like to drink something?
- Yes, a little water.
- There is also milk if you want.
WEDNESDAY
... I want to express my indignation
as a citizen and parliamentarian.
The Government must say
clearly
who asked for the services
of that foreign civil employee...
Very good!  Bravo!
... who pays him,
who authorized him
to function
within the police
and what did his functions
consist of, exactly?
You're angering yourself,
Mr. Martinez.
The methods of that innumerable
armed organization
serves a purpose.
It is evident. This violence
which angers everyone
is more useful than the democratic
system you say you defend.
It has raised the question of
the independence of our country.
I don't think
that you can teach me
about independence,
- nor of civic-mindedness
- No
But since they speak
about our independence,
you ask about
all those generous and
disinterested Americans
specialists, technicians,
lecturers, advisors,
that each day, they send to
various organizations,
IMF, United States Information Agency
Inter-American development bank, American Health Organization,
American Institute for
Free Labour Development,
- UN Development programs...
- Enough.
... Agricultural Commodity
Development Assistance
Peace Corps, all those people
that populate our country...
those people who populate our country
and all Latin America
with our consent...
Who works
in the factories?
The workers!
Ask the workers
if they prefer unemployment!
The Americans would not
give us money for nothing!
Mr. Fabbri, lets speak of your friends, the Russians.
I do not try to understand
ideology, but geography.
The Soviet Union is far away
The Yankees are even
inside the police headquarters.
In the police headquarters!
In the police headquarters!
They appeared in 1962.
Nobody knew nor who were,
nor what they did,
but they had an office
in the headquarters,
without a plate on the door, and they
had contacts with senior officers.
In 1966, its presence
becomes official
and then its head
officially arrives
Robert Bain, Lieutenant Colonel
of the Special Forces
The Police immediately puts
at his disposal
one Agent Bardéz,
who is more than a driver
or a bodyguard,
more than a simple policeman,
since he freely frequents
a place
where ordinary policemen
are not admitted:
the US Embassy
How did you get...
From whom did you get that data?
We are less distracted
than you
Or rather, that does not interest us,
unlike you, who is distracted.
Thus, in '66, this Robert Bain arrives.
He is also an expert of the
Agency of International Development
What's he an expert in?
A Lieutenant Colonel
of the Special Forces,
what could he develop?
If that Lieutenant Colonel
has come to do
what I know and what you
also know, that they have come to do,
I do not believe that they
are doing good
We continued existing,
we're better off than before,
I'm sorry for you.
And continuing to exist and develop,
were those that cannot be named,
but they represent,
nevertheless, a force
whose methods we did not approve,
but that represents
a revolutionary force...
a revolutionary force...
and a retort to the oppression
and to the corruption,
to the privilege...
Silence!  Please!
Silence!
Lieutenant Colonel Bain didn't do his job well
and for that reason they replaced him
by Philip Michael Santore,
the one Mr. Martinez spoke of
Mr. Santore was head of police in his country.
Shortly after, he  travelled around
Latin America before arriving
to our country.
In '69 you arrived
in our country.
Yes, in July.
You had an office
in the Headquarters...
Yes, the Office of A.I.D Technical Assistance
And another office in the Embassy...
Exactly.
Exactly.
In fact, I only worked there.
I went to the Headquarters
every fifteen days.
So you see, I've never involved
myself too much
in the affairs of the police.
Only you directed them
- I am not as important as you think.
- You are.
You are, and you went much more often
to the Headquarters.
A parking space was reserved for you next
to the police chief
You arrived every day
between 08:45 and 09:00
and you had your own office
on the same floor as himy
Do you know Captains
Pes and Romero?
Well enough. They've been in contact
with Technical Assistance.
Since when have you known them?
Since I came here
- A year more or less.
- No
You knew them in '67
in Washington, The
International Police Academy.
Technical progress has allowed
a man to land on the moon
But, even with that progress,
the authorities have not obtained,
in the fields of crime prevention
and criminal investigation,
to meet the challenge of
antisocial activities
that threaten the free world.
Many criminal acts are the
work of irresponsible elements
that pass as revolutionaries.
Their subversive activities
and their insurrectionary objectives
amply reflect
the principles of nationalism.
Due to that lack
of respect
towards humanity,
the responsible nations
have realised the need to
end terrorism so that
law and order rule again.
The civilian police,
when forming part of the first
line of defense of society,
have an obligation
to understand the problem better
in order to be able to solve them
or to fight them.
To that end,
our Academy was established.
So that the best
representatives
of all the police
of the free world
can meet,
to interchange ideas,
experiences
and to arrive at a deeper,
more global, vision
of the serious problems
that society faces nowadays.
Perhaps yes, Lopez and
Romero had been to the Academy.
It is possible.
Many people enter
in the Academy.
- About thirty from this country.
- 67 in four years.
You say that you did not know them
in Washington.
And nevertheless they were your students,
they were in your class.
Your point of view,
your experiences...
Don't try to be
too intelligent.
Act like you were speaking
with your friends, your wife
I am not married.
That's already part of our data.
With sincerity and with no inhibitions.
Between us there mustn't be secrets,
We tell everything, even
what we think
about our governments.
Mainly, because
governments change
and the police stays
Well.
These are the well-worn subjects,
those that you know well.
Political situations,
economic situations,
communist party, unions,
student movements,
guerrillas,
urban guerrillas, in your country...
My country...
It is a tiny country
with great problems.
In the communications network
that you specialise in
It is rather a network
of information.
You are the information
specialists.
It is very difficult, even for a policeman,
to enroll in the Academy.
A policeman can become
a revolutionary. And vice versa.
Not a policeman really.
You belong to an
individual species?
In some ways, yes.
Just like my Chinese
or Soviet colleagues.
We don't know them.
You work in our country.
The case is that our vocation
is the order
and therefore,
we do not like change
We are conservatives.
Here, many become police
from hunger,
not by vocation.
Yes, but they become policemen.
Others, through hunger,
become thieves.
Do you think that hunger
allows them to choose?
I believe that a man,
a man of truth,
always chooses
- You no?
- No
We don't really believe in men of truth.
We believe in men, Mr Santore
In the rightness of equality,
in the possibility of organizing ourselves
into a more just society,
happier...
- I also believe in all that.
- No, you don't believe in it.
You accept inequality,
you defends privilege.
At heart, you believe in property.
Your moral code is the exploitation
of the majority by a minority.
Exploitation.
The big word.
So why?  What do I gain
on a personal level?
The illusion of being a boss
and not what you really are,
that is to say, a servant.
THURSDAY
Communiqué no. 2
Movement of
National Liberation.
"Commando Liber Arce".
Firstly:the state of health
of Fernando Campos
is still satisfactory
and Mr. Philip Michael
Santore
recovers quickly
from his wound.
Secondly:We continue
the interrogations
in order to confirm the guilt
of both prisoners.
Thirdly:the Movement
of National Liberation
has arranged to release
the Consul of Brazil
and the civil employee
of the USA
in exchange for the liberation
of all the prisoners
accused or condemned
of political crimes
or linked to political crimes
detained in the prisons of the capital
and the countryside.
Fourthly:the countries to which
prisoners can be deported
can be Mexico, Peru yor Algeria.
The text of the communiqué
that has been published
regarding the kidnappings,
constitutes
on the part of the authors
of those crimes
a new blow to the established
order, aggravated
by an extortion attempt
on the legitimate power.
Secondly:
the authors of the text try
to demand from executive authority
that it removes
from accused and condemned,
lawful judicial procedures.
That is to say:they want
the constitution to be violated
by those who have the task
of upholding and respecting it.
Mr. Minister,
what do you think of the communiqué
of the Minister of the Interior?
It is a communiqué of
the Department of the Interior.
- Does the minister think the same?
- The minister does not have any opinion.
Without another point
of reference,
the communiqué represents
the position of the Government.
It will only be possible to speak
of such a position
when consultation has taken place
between
the different ministries.
- When?
- It seems to me
that it is the normal behavior
in a democracy.
Don't you agree,
Mr. Lucas?
Yes, in a democracy...
Make way.
Hello.
The Director is waiting.
For you too.
They want to register at
the University.
The Director has refused,
but even so they will do it.
- That's why he came?
- No
The Government has
constitutional problems.
You don't say!
They have banned
three political movements,
they have forced nine newspapers
to close down
they have arrested thousands of people
for going on strike
they have requisitioned
employees and workers
in order to force to them to return
to work...
And still you come here
to speak to me about the Constitution...
If I understood correctly,
according to the Constitution,
neither the President,
nor the Government has the right
to release those prisoners.
Indeed
But the United States, Brazil,
the Church, national and international public opinion
they're objectively forcing President and the Government
to accept the exchange
and to release
all the political prisoners.
So,  what can the
President do?
The only possibility
it is to present a decree
of amnesty to Parliament.
This, according to the Constitution,
is the only way
to annul a sentence.
Very well, but for various reasons
different interests,
both left and right,
all want to end with
this President.
In my opinion,
most of the Parliament
will take advantage of this
in order to vote against the amnesty.
And what happens then?
The exchange won't
be carried out.
But we said that the President
is forced...
- Then, he must resign.
- You see?
Of all our problems,
it is most important.
And you think that this is possible?
If all the convenient contradictions happen,
whoever replaces him
will have to accept
the exchange.
Why are these young people so
stubborn?
They're defending the autonomy
of the University
Stay seated
Alfredo!
- Where are they?
- Bastián, take a look
- Where?
- Here. They have taken the district.
Here, close by.
Prepare the consul.
Pretty car.
It's old, but it still
works well.
- I've seen others these days.
- Not so pretty.
Although we have been
in many garages.
You will have searched a lot of them.
- Yes, garages, houses...
- Sergeant, look at this.
It seems to be empty at the back
Take a look,it sounds empty
And with the bookcases...
as if they had blocked it up.
Good, if it's blocked up,
he's blocked up.
Isn't it a little boring,
all these searches?
To begin with,
it was fun.
But soon...
Going up and down stairs
for 4 days
I'm fed up.
I understand. And it's worse that
you've got to check one by one
Well, we've seen everything now.
Let's go.
Wait.
We stay.
Close it
Were they on top of us
yes?
They were close by.
- What a useless bunch
- No information.
Exactly.
And that means they have.
The appropriate technique,
the appropriate material...
You're crazy!
The continued use
of torture instruments
has been demonstrated
by the Investigating Commission.
Remind them that this Commission
of representatives is comprised
of all the parties
of the Parliament.
Its conclusions,
voted unanimously,
were as follows:
First:it has been demonstrated
that in our country
torture has become
frequent, systematic and
habitual.
Second:They have resorted to
using torture
against people who,
for being innocent,
have not been subjected to a legal
judgement,
and against people who,
when subjected to legal judgement,
have been declared innocent.
Third:the main victims of these methods
are students
and union leaders.
Fourth:the explanations
of the competent authorities,
that they deny the existence of these facts or declare
that they don't know them
are unacceptable.
Then to accept them
it would be to admit the existence,
within our police,
of parallel organizations,
independent and uncontrollable.
That's it, Mr. President.
Gentlemen,
all this has happened
in our country.
All this happens to the press
in our country.
All this must stop
in our country.
Gentlemen of the Government,
I do not know if they were or
weren't knowledgable about all this.
But in either case,
they no longer have the right
to govern our country.
Let us demand
a presidential election.
Exactly, that's our
intention.
Nevertheless, the tortures
continued. You know that,
since you were advisor
to our police.
You keep implicating me in things
that were none of my business
and that I totally ignored.
But your students at the Academy have been
accused of torture.
- That does not demonstrate anything.
- Yes.
Simple coincidence...
one more.
How many were sent to the Academy
since you arrived?
The last one was the eighth,
I think.
But I didn't send them,
the Government did.
37 exactly, selected
and recommended by you.
Here is the programme
of the Academy.
In five months of classes,
you hardly spoke of communications and traffic.
It's futile to continue speaking
of communications and traffic,
Isn't that true, Mr. Santore?
Very well. We didn't talk about it much.
Yes, you spoke a lot about revolutionary war,
of Algeria, of Cuba, of Vietnam...
You talked a lot about strikes,
of demonstrations,
of trade unionism,
of explosives...
Would you like to see it?
I know about it.
As far as the explosives,
there's a place in the Academy
that administers a specialist course
in Texas, an abandoned village
near the Mexican border.
There were 8 policemen who
specialized in explosives.
Deputy Commissioner Fontana.
Captain Piñatores
Deputy Commissioner Suárez.
Commissioner García
Deputy Commissioner Panizolo.
Commissioner Torresi.
Captain Bardés.
A provocative attack, by the police
Commissioner Benítez.
A provocative and
intimidatory attack.
That was the specialist program.
Yes, I know.
What was this fascination with explosives for?
They are the weapons
of terrorists.
It is necessary to learn
to know them.
They don't learn to defend themselves
against bombs, but to use them.
It is you who needs
the terrorists.
Why?
Why do they want them?
Good morning, Mr Rector.
Is it serious?
Do you know Enrique Machi?
I know him.
You were seen every week
in one
of the nightclubs.
You know him perfectly well
and we do too.
An old student of economics,
he never obtained
a degree,
but organised the first fascist
group in the university.
He opened three nightclubs,
and he liaises with one Johanna,
a young woman who has
a red VW,
secretary of the American cultural
attaché
You know much more about
that gentleman than me
That is not possible.
The file you have is the most complete
one in the country.
That is another myth.
But you knew that he is a fascist?
- We never spoke of politics.
- It happens.
And what did you speak of,
every week?
Of women?
Why not?
For that you paid him?
That's not very friendly since I'm
no longer young.
In any case, I never paid him.
Machi and his fascist organization
is very expensive.
Their members are killers, thugs,
professionals of violence.
Their services cost
lots of money.
Perhaps... but I never
paid them.
Mr Pero Machi takes care
of the transactions
involving cars of the American Embassy workers
You're only asking me about foreign cars!
It's a way to finance
an agent-provocateur
Why? So that these people serve him?
That a policeman frequents
a nightclub does not prove anything.
And the fact that it was me doesn't,
either.
Naturally
Nor frequenting
a photographic laboratory.
Do you know Agent Bardés?
You know him very well.
We do too.
Ex-Agent Bardés,
expelled from the police for robbery.
All the newspapers mentioned it.
He's changed.
A photographer, he continues doing
what he did,
supported by the police,
but without compromising it.
It is the principle
of the "Death squad".
To eliminate adversaries
without the problems of the Constitution,
of laws, courts.
Captain Lopez,
for the police,
along with Fontana,
Captain Riggi, of the navy,
Colonel González,
of the Army,
Commander Piñatores,
of the Air Force
And Bardés, the confidante of
Bain, your predecessor.
So as to serve the secret High Command,
this organization of extra
assassins at our service,
what does it want?
What will they do in the future?
Is your son there?
- What do you want?
- Police. Come with us.
He hasn't done anything.
He's no longer involved in politics!
Let him go!
He's only been free for a week!
Indeed,we don't agree with it.
Well, you know him?
No, I do not know him.
- You do not know him.
- No
But you recognize yourself?
No
You do not know him, eh?
- No!
- No?
We know them
they are Tupamaros.
Come.
Is that the Martinera?
- Yes.
- It happens
Everyone leave,
it is only a check,
Everyone leave, please.
Attention... I repeat.
All those that are
inside section 20
must leave immediately.
You are not just any employee.
You are not an employee,
or a mere specialist.
You are a leader.
You directed Belo Horizonte police,
in Brazil,
And those of the Dominican Republic
and ours.
You do it directly,
and through men you send
to Washington,
where they learn to betray
their country.
You say that you defend
freedom and democracy.
Your methods...
are war, fascism, torture.
Agreed, Mr. Santore?
You are communist subversives!
You want to destroy
society,
the fundamental values of our civilization,
the existence of the free world.
You must be fought
at all costs.
- I have nothing else to say to you.
- Same here.
I would like to know...
What type of civilization
are you fighting to create?
Really?
It is a weakness.
For a civilization where people like you would
not make sense.
FRIDAY
Communiqué no. 3
Mr. Fernando Campos,
Consul of Brazil,
is and has demonstrated himself
to be the worthy representative
of the savage dictatorship
of Brazil.
Mr. Philip Michael Santore,
citizen of the USA,
civil employee of the A.I.D.,
is and has demonstrated to be
during the interrogations
the person in charge, in our country,
and in others of Latin America,
of an organization which,
parallel to the police
and concealed by it,
is dedicated to activities
of espionage and repression
by means of methods
that they contemplate
the political assassination,
and torture.
If the Government rejects
our proposal to release
immediately all
the political prisoners,
the accused prisoners
will be brought to justices.
It's that house.
- Is it safe?
- Yes.
Excuse me, Mr. President,
Go back to the beginning:
"... I would like my people to
understand."
Very well.
We will already speak.
I would like my people
to understand the responsibility
that falls upon me.
I adamantly hope that
this distressing situation
does not have a tragic end.
But the affair, in spite of
its international implications,
since the victims are not
subjects of our country,
is strictly a police matter.
Like the President of the Republic,
I have a supreme duty
to defend the right,
to defend the institutions,
to defend lawful justice
since that is the only one
that can judge
and convict.
SATURDAY MORNING
- Mr Snow, please
Yes?  What's happening?
He doesn't speak our language.
What's happening?
We are the police.
We have orders to detain Mr Snow.
He must come with us
to the police station.
- A simple formality.
- Okay
Perhaps I should call
his secretary.
It's better not to call anybody.
Do as you're told.
The keys.
It's preferable that you
keep quiet for ten minutes
if you don't want problems.
This is no longer funny.
It is heartbreaking.
The Government no longer governs.
It responds to problems
with violence.
But the other violence,
the one that it has triggered,
it is much more intelligent.
This morning, when
the Minister of Agriculture
was told of the new kidnapping,
the President urgently summoned
his ministers, the deputies,
the big landowners.
The Economics Minister,
politician, banker,
president of 4 companies,
2 of them American,
The Minister
of Foreign Affairs,
politician, banker,
he controls 70 companies,
representing the
Rockefeller group.
Their companies have
200,000 hectares.
The Vatican Ambassador,
head of a group that controls
85 companies,
19 of them foreign.
Minister, proprietor
of two newspapers.
Ex-minister,
Politician, two banks.
6 companies,
2 of them American.
The Herbert family, bankers,
they controls 300,000 hectares,
7 companies, 3 of them American,
A politician, a Minister,
a former Minister.
More bankers.
More industrialists
that were former ministers.
Ministers who are bankers
or industrialists.
Industrial bankers
that will be ministers.
And finally,
the Minister of the Interior,
the only one that is neither a
banker, nor rich,
and whose task is to defend
the rich ones and the bankers.
If they are all gathered
it is, to take
an important decision,
very important.
And given events, there is
only one possibility...
the resignation of the President
and the exchange, negotiated
for the new president.
This one for the front page.
Wonderful,
he is the President.
- Where did you get it?
- Look at the caption.
- Was he also a boxer?
- A mediocre boxer.
Middleweight.
He became a mediocre
journalist and soon...
in mediocre parliamentarian.
Who'd could have imagined
that he would be a
mediocre president?
Everybody.
A purely rhetorical question.
- Is the biography ready?
- Here it is.
We can only wait for
the official notice
of resignation.
Are you, Ogo?
Yes.
Who is it?
Inspector Ravallo
Are you still living
in 8th of October Avenue
with the family
of your brother?
We are your prisoners.
Behave yourselves.
Lopez, has anyone removed that
bullet from the nape of your neck?
The handcuffs.
And now, we will wait for Hugo.
How were we discovered?
A very good blow, Lopez.
Who are you?
We waited for the others,
for the meeting.
This one is of the old guard,
Captain.
I believe so.
Come, we are going to chat a little...
while we wait for the others.
- It's the police.
- Go back.
They don't tell us anything,
what we are going to write?
What is better, to write
or to try to understand?
Ladies and gentlemen, I am here with
the Police Commander
and of Captain Lopez,
who has managed to arrest the rebels,
and I'm going to interview them
Will this capture have an effect
on the luck of the three kidnap victims?
I hope so
How?
It's not possible to say, yet.
By all means, I don't know.
that they have... the kindness
to lead us into the place
or the places in where
they're hidden.
In any case, we will ask them.
In any case,
Do you think that they know those places?
We have good reason
to believe
that these are the people that direct
the organization.
Could you tell us
how you managed to carry out
the raid?
How did you catch them, Captain?
With patience...
- And something of luck, perhaps?
- No
It has not been luck.
But to find out the place
where the kidnap victims are held
how will that happen?
So the terrorists know
where the prisoners are?
Get ready, we're leaving
That's enough already !  Quick!
- Get ready, we're going, Mr Snow
- What?
- Are you here?
- Yes, right here.
- Are you Santore?
- Yes.
Get ready, we're leaving
What's happening?
You too, get ready
SATURDAY EVENING
Communiqué number 4
First:in case of criminal charges,
of coaxed confessions,
of tortures,
or of death of our
fellow prisoners,
severe measures will be taken
of retaliation.
The people in charge of the forces
of repression and the oligarchy
will answer for the physical
well-being of our comrades.
Second:the ultimatum
has ended
without the government
answering our proposal.
Therefore, the Movement
of National Liberation
has consequently decided to execute
Mr. Philip Michael Santore.
Third:the execution will take place
24 hours after the circulation
of this official notice
and if the government
has not accepted
our proposal of exchange.
SUNDAY
You say that you defend freedom and democracy.
Your methods are war,
fascism and torture.
Agreed, Mr. Santore?
You are communist subversives!
You want to destroy society,
the fundamental values of our civilization,
the existence of the free world.
You must be fought at all costs.
- I have nothing else to say to you.
- Same here
Has it been
cold tonight?
A little.
And your wound?
It is better.
We leave in 2 hours time.
Change again?
Yes.
And the guy who took care of me?
Now I'm the guy
who takes care of you.
If you like,
write to your family.
Yes, very well.
Any news?
It's good.
Wait.
Victor. A small table, please.
Thanks.
Perhaps you will be executed tomorrow.
We didn't think about it,
we would prefer not to do it,
not because you don't deserve to die, but
because we would prefer another solution.
Did you want to use me
for an exchange?
Yes. And we still want that.
There's still hope.
Let us speak a little.
It could be useful to me.
How?
Not like you think.
But I know how they think
the others,
their reactions.
It is very important
in a deal.
If you think you can influence them,
you can write...
You can write to the ambassador.
I will do it, but first,
explain the situation
and what has happened.
Something just happened,  yes?
Sit down, please.
Until yesterday, the situation
was balanced.
We captured yesterday
another employee
of the A.I.D.
- Who?
- An agronomist.
The situation changed
in our favor.
The government had to accept
the exchange
or to resign.
The situation is that he was
on the verge of resigning...
and it was then the police
arrested certain comrades.
- How many?
- Some.
lmportant?
All are important.
The police agreed
that they are very important.
And you're sure?
In a certain sense, yes.
- The government will not resign.
- No
They won't resign.
And it has blocked
negotiations.
The Minister of the Interior
has given out a victory communiqé
And you have fixed an ultimatum.
Yes.
- Does this only concern me?
- You're the most guilty.
Still we have 24 hours left.
Do you think we'll be able to do something?
No. I don't think so.
Does he think that your government
will intervene?
Given the situation, no.
It thinks you're more useful
dead than alive.
Yes.
Yes, I believe so.
You are in a crisis,
and they take advantage of it.
They will try to give you
the coup de grace.
It's enough for them to take advantage of
what you do
They really do not know
what we are going to do.
I do not know what you will
eventually do,
but I know what
they will do.
Because they will do what I would do
if I were in its place.
That is to say, nothing.
They have brought 100 FBI agents
In order to protect the Embassy
and to the American citizens.
The police no longer have their confidence.
And you do not have a choice.
If you kill me,
it will be a cruel and impotent
gesture.
If you do not kill me...
it will be a sign
of weakness...
and therefore of impotence.
We have just a short time left.
If you want to write...
Yes, I am going to write.
Not to the Ambassador.
To my wife.
Mr. Ambassador...
Mr. Ambassador.  What is
the position of your Government?
Have you received
a message from the Pope?
For 24 hours, total silence!
So that meeting with
the Minister of Foreign Affairs?
Do you think that there's any hope for
Campos and Santore?
A declaration,
Mr. Minister!
Gentlemen, please!
They know that the Government
is deliberating.
I excused myself to talk with
the Ambassador.
Mr. President!
A little patience!
When the meeting finishes,
there will probably be
a press conference
or a communiqué
- Do you really want to save them?
- This is a serious subject.
- There they are.
- They're here!
You can see that I fulfill my promises.
But we'll try not to uselessly prolong the matter
I will say that from the beginning
that the Government  has not
modified its position.
Do you want to say
that the communiqué of the Minister
of the Interior
of the other day
is still valid?
Exactly.
The communiqué of the Minister
of the Interior
it reflected and reflects
the point of view of the executive.
Like all self-respecting
democracies.
So be it.
And your personal point of view?
The Government has adopted
the only possible position
that it could take to defend
its sovereignty and that
of the other countries
involved.
Have you spoken with the Ambassador
about the ultimatum of the rebels?
What do you think?
Then.. yes.
And how has the Ambassador reacted?
In that case, you should have asked the question better.
In any case, the attitude
of the Ambassador of the USA,
as well as the one of the
Ambassador from Brazil,
has been of understanding
and respect
towards our sovereignty.
And they bear in mind that the decision
of the executive authority
it is only the possible one.
Mr. Minister,
the ultimatum runs out
within twelve hours.
According to the terms
of that ultimatum,
Philip Michael Santore
will be executed.
What is the question?
Nothing.
There is no question.
I have received the report.
Then, you know the situation.
This is not a sentimental problem.
It never was
This is a political problem
Yes or no?
I am not safe.
He certainly deserves it.
But I do not know what is better
for us.
We're not the only
Latin Americans.
You understand?
If we execute him,
the press, the television,
the radio will speak
of his seven children.
If we did not execute him,
the Governments will be strengthened,
the revolutionary movements
will be weakened.
We have started up
a revolutionary mechanism
without being able to make them
respect it
Or to see it through to
the end ourselves.
You ought to have thought
this through before..
Precisely because of that,
we're consulting you.
Yes or no?
Yes.
I have received the report.
Then, you know the situation.
This is not a sentimental problem.
It never was.
This is a political problem
Yes or no?
Yes.
Then you know the situation
This isn't a sentimental problem
It never was.
This is a political problem.
Yes or no?
I had thought...
The report explains the situation.
- Yes or no?
- Yes.
I have received the report.
Then, you know the situation.
This is not a sentimental problem.
It never was.
This is a political problem.
Yes or no?
No
I have received the report.
Then you know the situation.
This does not cure
a sentimental problem.
We didn't have one.
This cures a political problem.
Yes or no?
Yes.
What about the other two
prisoners?
They are not directly responsible,
particularly the agronomist.
He is really an agronomist
and a good man. We will release them.
- We have majority of "yeas".
- We also.
We also.
Unanimously "yea".
And you?
Majority.
It needs to happen quickly.
We just have a short time.
