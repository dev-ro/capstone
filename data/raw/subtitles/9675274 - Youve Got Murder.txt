DISTRICT POLICE DEPARTMENT
APPRECIATION PLAQUE
Hello?
Hello?
Yes, Alaaddin?
Yes.
Okay.
Who's coming?
Says who? Asuman?
Okay.
He can send the location to Asuman.
He can send the location.
Loca... location. Vocation, voca...
Location, location.
The vacation.
Okay. I'm coming.
Morning, Chief.
Thank you.
I've got a hot bagel.
Thanks, I don't want to eat.
-Asuman, what have you done to your hair?
-What?
What do you mean? Look at that perm!
-I didn't do it.
-Then how's it like that?
I slept with wet hair.
Is my hair all messy?
Yes, little bit.
Come on, let's go.
Oh, no.
Akçay is also good, Chief.
We've looked there as well.
I want to own a small piece of land
and grow everything on it.
Tomato, potato...
You can even grow eggplant.
You can grow everything.
Just go there twice in a week,
that's enough.
You can swim in the sea.
Have a cup of tea.
Have your breakfast.
What more can you ask for?
There is tea in the thermos, Chief.
If you want.
If you don't mind,
we can drink it together.
I do mind, Asuman.
You can have it, Chief.
I had my tea before I left home.
Asuman.
We have a long way to go.
Let's just have a silent journey.
Sure.
I'm so sorry. I need to call my mother.
I need to ask her something. Sorry.
Hello?
Mom, what is this bill for?
Is it Dad's phone bill or yours?
So, it's Dad's? Yours... or Dad's?
Oh, Mom. The one I last received.
That one. Is it Dad's? No, yours is...
The last digits are the same, Mom.
You're three, and he's five.
I don't know them by heart.
Is it Dad's number or is it yours?
That's all I'm asking, Mom.
Mom, is it his or is it yours?
Just a simple...
I have, Mom. So, it's yours? Your...
Is it yours or Dad's? Mom, please.
Yours... Dad's... okay.
-Kisses.
-Whose is it?
Whose is it?
-It's my mom's.
-Your mom's!
Your mom's!
Was it too hard to say it?
Can't she say, "It's mine"?
Unbelievable!
Is this the right time
to talk about such things?
You see, she got confused as well.
Don't do such things. It's not right.
Where have you been?
-What the hell is that?
-What happened here?
What is this, Alaaddin?
Someone left him inside the tree,
just like this.
Is it a man?
We got a call from HQ, and came over.
-I don't know much either.
-God Almighty.
Did you do that?
Why would we do such thing?
I guess he was tortured as well.
But I'm not sure. Without CSI...
Why hasn't the CSI team come?
What's all this stuff? Those paints?
Clean up this place.
You turned this place into a fair.
What's his ID?
Chief, he is naked, as you can see.
I just got here. I don't know much.
Let's just wait for CSI.
I don't know, but they're kinda late.
Oh, God.
Alaaddin, why do we come before CSI?
-Right.
-Are we the relatives of this man?
-Chief, there is a tire mark--
-Still talking about a tire.
-What tire?
-Right.
What are we doing here
at the crack of dawn?
Why do we come here before everyone?
-You're right.
-That's all I'm asking.
Personally, I believe the body
was brought here from another place.
What do we do now?
God!
Asuman. You said
you had tea back in the car.
Bring it. Let's drink some tea.
Did you get a perm?
I slept with wet hair, it became frizzy.
You should have waited for CSI to arrive,
then called us.
We're just waiting here.
Yes, what did you find?
We were talking about it
before you came, Chief.
-So?
-I put the report there, Chief.
I know that we can't complain.
-This is our job after all, but--
-What's up?
They wake me up
at 4:00 in the morning, Chief.
Something happened somewhere,
they give me the address,
we go there, come back, and so on.
We go there, but there's nothing to do.
Why? Because CSI is not there.
What do you mean, you have nothing to do?
Aren't you a cop?
Sure I am, but we did nothing
other than sit around.
-Am I wrong, Asuman?
-You're right.
-Am I wrong?
-You're right.
We can wait for 16 hours
from time to time.
But the CSI team
has turned this into a habit.
Someone needs to talk to them.
I beseech you.
But we did get there a little early.
Salih is right.
Of course, the CSI team
should have been there.
I don't think they say,
"Oh, bodies can wait a little longer."
They do keep their nose
to the grindstone as well.
I know this firsthand.
It's a complete dead end.
I'm not happy with this, Chief.
One of us can go to the scene
and make a full report
while the rest of us wait here
until evening, simple as that.
Salih, I see your point,
but you need to go there
and look at the body right in the face.
This is what you do.
Chief, I have no objection
to going to the murder sites near me.
I'd love to do it.
Everybody goes to murder sites
right outside their doors, right?
Right, we can do that.
What do you say? It's your choice.
-Did I say that, Alaaddin?
-Well--
Did I say, "Everybody can take
cases close to them"?
No, I just wanted to support you.
-Like this?
-Why can't we have tea here?
We can't drink anything.
İbrahim is boiling the water, I guess.
We've been drinking so much tea.
How is that supporting?
You're saying different things.
Salih, stop.
Go to the hospital
and talk to the doctor beforehand.
Don't wait for the autopsy.
Asuman, Alaaddin, you will go
and see the victim's family.
Talk to anyone who has a relationship
-with the victim.
-Okay, Chief.
Go on out.
What can I say? What can I say to you?
What am I supposed to say?
He hasn't been at home since last month.
Sometimes he goes away
for two or three months.
He could have enemies, lovers,
maybe he goes around picking fights,
"Who does he talk to? What does he do?"
I don't know any of that.
He never tells me anything. He doesn't.
Yeah?
No!
What happened?
How did that happen?
-What happened?
-Who did... what?
Yes. No, our investigation is still...
We're not done yet. We are on our way.
Sure, Chief.
-There was another murder.
-A murder?
Same as the last one.
All right.
What is that?
The same. Painted and decorated
like the previous victim.
Well, some broken bricks, and...
There is no roof. Well, rags.
There are rocks
on the victim's eyes this time.
There is a poem again.
Chief, does this remind you of anything?
Is the murderer the same person?
We should investigate that.
The first thing to think about
is whether there is a link
between these murders or not.
Let's just say... I'm thinking out loud...
Don't think out loud.
Is there an ID or something?
Chief, we found his ID in his pocket.
They are trying to contact his family.
Chief, they have contacted his mother.
Should they bring her here
or the police station?
To the police station.
Why would they bring her here?
To the station.
Why would you bring her here?
Will you bring a mother to a crime scene?
How can we...
They are here, Chief.
For fuck's sake.
I'm sorry for your loss.
-How are you? Do you need something?
-Show me my son.
They are keeping me here,
they don't let me out.
Our friends are examining the crime scene.
You should stay strong.
I have a couple of questions for you.
Your answers may help us
in finding the murderer.
Chief, this is not the same
as the other one.
Our friends tried to touch the body
to get a sample.
It's completely rotten.
It's falling apart on contact.
There are worms everywhere.
What an awful way to die.
What I think is that, I'm just saying,
the murderer might have
put him to sleep first and tortured him,
and then strangled him to death
when he woke up.
I'm thinking out loud.
You fucking animal.
How can you say these things
in front of her? Can't you see her?
I'm fed up with him thinking out loud
and "just saying."
-Have you lost your senses? Fucking--
-Are there... What?
Yes, Chief.
You always talk through your hat here.
-Do we have anyone like that?
-I'm sorry, Chief.
-I did not see her.
-How didn't you see her?
Wait a second.
We want to apologize
for our impertinent friend here.
He does that to all of us. Just know that.
Not just to you, to all of us.
I lent him 3,000 liras a long time ago.
He didn't even...
Why are you talking to her like that?
Why are you talking to her like that?
Chief, I don't even know
what I'm saying anymore.
I haven't slept, I'm tired.
I'll go home and rest.
You can't. We will assess the situation.
Go wait for me over there.
And then we'll get some tea
at the seaside.
-I couldn't sleep and rest.
-No.
Let me go home, please.
I'll go and sleep at home.
What the hell is happening?
Murders like this that are decorated,
containing a message,
-usually belong to the gangs, but--
-No. No.
The victims do not have
any history of crime.
If it was a crime of passion,
it would be obvious.
Nothing was said about that.
I know. That is what I am saying.
Even though this looks like
a crime of passion... it is not.
The same thing.
What? It doesn't even look like that.
If it were a crime of passion,
the murderer would not leave a name.
-It's not.
-It's not.
It's not. So we should not think about
the possibility of a crime of passion.
Don't. Don't think about that.
So, let's move on.
-Can I get you something?
-I would like a kiwi tea.
-Me, too.
-Chief, what about you?
-Does everyone want kiwi?
-We all want kiwi tea.
-Me, too.
-Salih?
-I want normal tea.
-We all want kiwi, don't spoil it.
Do we have to drink kiwi tea?
I don't want kiwi.
Salih, drink kiwi. You're tired.
I mean, it will make you...
It's good for you.
If you drink tea, you will...
I mean, you--
Okay, Chief. Let's drink kiwi.
-I'll drink kiwi, too.
-Okay.
Change my tea to kiwi.
Bring me a large glass of kiwi.
A large one, kiwi.
Chief, another murder. The same again.
-No!
-Is it decorated again?
Decorated, painted.
What are we going to do?
Three blood-chilling murders
have grabbed the headlines.
The investigation is still ongoing.
Police refuse
to divulge further information,
but the findings show that
it might be a serial killer.
This is a trending topic on social media,
so we asked people for their views.
Let's see what our citizens have to say.
Guys, as you all know,
we have a situation
that we have never faced before.
The press's spotlight is on us.
We are the focus of the people.
So there is tremendous pressure on us.
And so, a colleague,
Dizdar Koşu, is joining our team.
Dizdar Koşu has accomplished
great things abroad,
especially in the USA,
and he is an expert on serial killers.
Hello, guys.
Yes, I wish good luck
to all of you. Mr. Koşu.
Hello, guys.
My name is Dizdar Koşu.
I am an expert in criminology.
You'll learn what a criminology expert is
as you get to know me.
So, I'm going into details directly.
When I see a case,
I ask myself these 13 questions.
When? Which? With what? Why?
What happened? Who?
From where? How?
When? From whom?
What? What is obvious?
-To what? Who?
-What?
Very good. This is already
one of our questions.
No, I mean, I didn't understand.
Please repeat that.
Don't make him go back
and repeat all of that. Please go on.
If we can answer four of these questions,
just four of them, it means
we have solved half of the case.
-Let's ask away.
-Who?
Who?
Correct. That's what
we are looking for. Who?
-How?
-How? The first's strangled. Strangling.
Can we work like that?
We can. Let's continue.
We will delve deeper slowly.
Let's ask the questions. Chief, ask one.
-How much?
-How much what?
I don't know. I'm just asking, how much?
How much? Right!
How much could it be?
He killed the victims completely.
All the way, completely.
I don't understand anything.
Let's go on, don't be shy.
Please ask questions.
What do we have? What are our questions?
"What is obvious?"
It is obvious that he killed all of them.
Obvious. How many were there?
That isn't one of the questions.
No, he is talking about the victims.
There were three murders. Three.
Anyway, let's continue with the questions.
-You will get used to it.
-Used to what?
To what? To the man. I mean, the victim.
What?
What? The man. The victim.
From where?
From where? From the man.
-The victim.
-How much?
How much?
-What do you mean "how much"?
-Well...
-When?
-When?
When... What did they say
was the time of death?
Mr. Koşu. From whom?
Chief, this is the most important one.
The key question.
This is more important
than who the killer is.
How?
Strangling.
Okay.
Okay, Mr. Koşu. We see your point.
You have a...
I get it, you have your own unique style,
but we can't adapt this style
into our force right now,
right at this table.
"Do you have one? Do you have one? Hey!
Is it so fast? Lights and abracadabra.
Beam or... ruby."
What would the killer say here?
Is it a cry for help or is it a plea?
Is it a sign of mourning?
By the way, I looked at all the poems.
It does not belong to any local
or foreign poet that we know.
It belongs to the killer, 95%.
Only a maniac can commit these murders.
Of course these poems are
the product of his perverted mind.
This is what I believe.
Okay.
-There's been another murder, Chief.
-That's it!
What the hell?
He...
He doesn't even let us eat.
Give us a break. Is this the same man?
We currently don't know if it's
a he or she, Salih.
-Is it the same person?
-Just a regular murder.
-Exactly.
-Homicide detectives are here.
Okay, you carry on.
Take a sample from the sweater, okay?
-What do we have?
-It's about money.
The argument between partners
became violent.
We have footage from the security cam.
We got the murderer.
-So, this is a normal case then, right?
-Just a simple murder.
Doesn't Seher know
what we're dealing with?
I really don't know, Chief.
We can't go to every murder scene.
-Aren't you from homicide?
-Yes, we are.
But this is a normal murder.
We're in the wrong place.
They should not send us to a murder
connected to money issues.
I'm calling her, Chief.
There is nothing much here.
-I can send you the file.
-Don't send me anything.
I don't want to see anything.
I'm gonna talk to HQ.
Bro, look,
we're only looking for serial killers.
We have no business with murders
that are not repetitive.
If the same guy... Am I right?
If the same guy kills someone
over a money problem once again, call us.
I see.
I just want to say this.
The thing I do here...
is important to me.
When I get into the car--
-What are you trying to say?
-My colleague called it in, I guess.
I explained the situation to you,
I apologize.
-Don't misunderstand me.
-You don't need to apologize.
-For God's sake, let's get out of here!
-What's he talking about?
As if I'm cooking a meal here.
-How can you talk like that?
-Don't get me wrong.
Get inside. Get back to your work.
Dear God.
-God. He's not picking up.
-He's talking about a meal.
People have gone mad.
Okay, guys.
We have a group of experts from Ankara.
They will help us with the serial killer.
-Welcome to the team.
-Thank you.
-All right. Emel...
-Emel Umar.
Mrs. Umar is a forensic psychologist.
And beside her...
Uygar Ten.
Mr. Ten is a criminologist.
Bengü Tömer.
-Mrs. Tömer is a...
-Technology expert.
Technology expert.
I'll leave the stage to them
and go have a cup of tea.
-It's a pleasure.
-Mrs. Umar, let me take your jacket.
No need. Thank you.
All right. As you please.
-I believe that--
-Mrs. Tömer, why don't you sit here?
It looks drafty there.
I'm Dizdar Koşu. I'm a criminology expert.
-I lead the team.
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too.
-Why don't you sit down?
-Please.
-Well...
Salih, get up
and offer your chair to Mrs. Tömer.
Why? They can sit there.
There is a window behind.
It might be drafty.
-We can close the window.
-Then we might suffocate.
Don't bother. I can move there.
That's not happening. Please.
Salih, she doesn't want
to sit where it's drafty. Get up.
God. Okay, I will move.
-Belda, please have a seat.
-It's Bengü.
Okay, I gave you my seat.
Mrs. Umar, you can sit beside me,
if you'd like.
-No need. I can sit here.
-As you please.
Okay. We'd like to
get on with the briefing.
And then, we can start working.
Are you hungry? What would you like?
-No, we are not. Thanks.
-No, thanks.
-We came from Ankara--
-We can order something to eat.
-Well...
-No, we're good.
We can have pide?
I don't eat meat, thanks.
Chicken?
-I don't eat chicken either.
-Okay.
Thanks. Now--
Tea, coffee, or something cold?
-Thanks.
-Kiwi or any kind of tea?
-Thank you.
-As you please.
-I'd like some water.
-Call İbo. Order water. Quick.
-Wait, I can--
-He isn't answering. I... sit.
-I'll find İbrahim.
-I'll go.
Yeah?
Okay, I'm coming. Stop!
I cannot hear anything.
The suspect has been located.
We'll raid the place. Let's go.
-Okay, we're coming. Take my radio.
-I'll get your radio.
Go, go, go.
Suspect is a 30 or 35-year-old male.
He has a Facebook group. He's the admin.
-Okay, Chief.
-There, on that thing,
they embellish mannequins.
And then, they write poems
below the photos.
Then, we have found him. He's our guy.
Why would he commit a second murder
in the same way on the internet?
-That's right.
-But there is a similarity
between the poems.
Chief, if the poem is that important,
I can write one now.
We cannot arrest someone
just because he writes poems.
We need a direct relation to the victim.
We need clear evidence.
Our murderer kills men randomly.
Then let's arrest someone randomly.
What do you think?
Right?
God.
It's all clear down there.
Don't shoot me, please
How are you, Asuman?
Was that you?
Thank you, Dizdar. How are you?
Thank you, thanks.
Alaaddin?
Alaaddin, what are you doing here?
Did you see something there?
What are you looking at?
Answer me.
What did you see there?
-Alaaddin?
-Yeah?
What are you doing?
-We are searching the place.
-Okay. Now, look.
What the fuck did you do?
Nothing, Chief!
Salih shot the mannequin.
Shit!
-Yes, Seher?
-Turn the fucking lights on!
-We're already there. Okay.
-Come on!
Yes. We are
carrying out the operation now.
-Open some windows!
-Don't call us at inappropriate times.
We fucked up.
You don't call when it is needed.
Okay. Hang up.
-I wish to welcome you one more time.
-Thank you, it's good to see you.
-It's good to see you.
-It's better to see you.
It's even better to see you.
I think there is a misunderstanding.
I think... where are you taking me?
We will go to Cihangir
and play with the cats together.
-We will be on the news.
-Sir, what...
-Sir--
-Salih, gather up.
We are leaving the scene. Come on.
I'm here, Chief. Okay.
Alaaddin! Asuman!
I don't know if you can say the same,
-but it's better to see you.
-Asuman!
-It's way better to see you.
-Mr. Koşu!
-Welcome.
-Thank you, it's good to see you.
-Yeah?
-Mr. Koşu, we're out.
Anyway, maybe we can...
Yeah.
How are you?
-I'm fine, sir.
-Are you hungry?
-I'm not, sir.
-I can get you something.
Eat something.
-Do you want pide?
-Eat something.
-No, sir. Thank you.
-Eat something, champ.
When did you last eat something?
At 8:00 this morning.
-You should eat.
-It's noon. How many hours have passed?
-I'll order pide. Would you eat that?
-I can have pide.
-Pide?
-I won't eat, sir.
-Pide with meat and cheese?
-Yes.
I'll get one, too.
Hey, look over here.
We want three pides with meat and cheese.
Make one bigger.
-I'll have soup. Do you want soup?
-Yes, but a small portion.
-Lentil soup?
-Yes.
-Lentil soup?
-Say yes.
-I won't have soup, sir.
-Mine is lentil, too.
-Just say yes.
-I'll have a small portion. Yours is big.
Three lentil soups. Two are small.
Would you drink ayran?
I will get ayran.
Would you... Add three ayrans.
While we are waiting for our food,
-maybe we can talk about something.
-Of course.
For example...
why would people kill other people?
-Yes, for example.
-I haven't killed anyone, sir.
Dear Ziya, wait.
We didn't say anything like that.
-Just relax, you get upset quickly.
-Did I say that?
Don't do that, please. Please.
Don't mind Alaaddin. He didn't mean it.
-Maybe you know something.
-Yeah.
I don't know anything, sir.
Tell us. He is nervous.
-Don't mind us.
-He will cry. You look sad.
-Don't do that.
-Drink some water.
-Ziya, drink water. Relax.
-Drink, champ.
There is nothing to be scared of.
We are just talking.
Exactly.
Which team?
-Pardon, sir?
-Which team do you support?
EsEs, sir.
-Which one is that?
-Eskişehirspor.
-It's Eskişehirspor.
-Es es es, ki ki ki.
Good. Look.
Now that you mentioned Eskişehir,
it's enough for me.
I have a memory from back there.
-I'll share one of mine, after you.
-It's so weird.
Again?
Really?
Where?
Is it decorated again?
Painted and stuff?
What the hell is that, Seher?
I'll round up the team.
My father had a wound under his foot.
Okay? It's like that...
A callus. A vertical wound, okay?
But it had a scab outside
and was infected.
It was disgusting, but he was my father.
There's nothing to do.
You know, sometimes,
scabs get a bumpy surface.
It had a strange mark.
On the scab,
there was a face. Weird as hell.
I looked at the face.
Oh, my God, it was my father!
My father himself!
What's happening there?
What are they doing?
I'll show you.
It's like that. Right...
What the hell are you doing?
Chief, the interrogation
is proceeding very well. Perfect.
We're doing really good, sir.
Fuck off, let him out.
There is a new murder.
When?
Just now.
Come out, immediately.
Everyone's crazy.
Look at them.
Ziya, this is not about you.
Are you crazy?
What was that?
Well, I don't know, sir.
Mr. Koşu said "good cop, bad cop."
I was the good cop, he was the bad one.
No, I didn't say such a thing.
-What? What do you mean "no"?
-Alaaddin...
I said, "Good cop is me."
What did I say?
"I'm the good cop, the bad cop is..."
-I pointed at you.
-No. This is not true.
When we were going in,
you pointed at me as the good one,
and yourself as the bad one.
You misunderstood me, Alaaddin.
I didn't... You played the good cop
back there?
Yes, and I was watching you
because you too were playing the good cop.
So I thought,
"I should be better, so that..."
-That explains it. That's what happened.
-And I said,
"If this is a bad cop,
I should be even nicer."
-I'm really sorry.
-No worries. It's done.
-I'm really sorry, but...
-I wish I had been the bad one.
That's the reason
why I said we should've talked.
Now what we did was a good cop
and an even better cop.
But I also did the better one.
Dear sir.
-Get out.
-Go.
We were harsh on him now,
but he is a sweet boy.
A really funny man. So funny.
He is a comedian.
Let's go.
Guys, take samples from each color.
Let's examine the crime scenes.
They are all on the historical island.
Most of them are workplaces
or urban transformation areas.
There are 20 roads to arrive
to one of these four locations
from any starting point.
What we need to do now is
to control these roads
with the help of police forces.
The most clear evidence we have
are the paints that were used
at the crime scenes.
The lab results indicate
that the paints were imported.
The only place where the killer
can obtain these paints from is Tahtakale.
Since the paints are sold in blocks,
they need to be powdered
before application.
And these powdered paints
dry up in 12 hours
and lose their functionality.
Because of this,
the killer needs to buy new paint
before committing his next murder.
If he hasn't already bought
all the paint in stock.
In light of the information
you've given us,
that's all we can offer you for now.
The most likely place
to come across the killer is Tahtakale.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Thank you.
What do you think?
I don't know what to say.
I say, "God help us all." Alaaddin.
-Yes, Chief.
-Inform Public Order forces
to increase their patrols and look for
suspicious people in the neighborhood.
Yes, Chief. But we don't have
a description. How will they know?
If they see a man walking around
with dry paint,
-they take him in. Okay?
-Yes, Chief.
Salih, I don't want any problems
with the surveillance cams.
What's wrong? You're not in the mood.
You seem upset.
No, I'm good.
It was just so much information.
Do you know what?
Maybe I come over tonight,
we can relax together, okay?
Damn your neighborhood and all the stores.
It took me forever to get here.
Those shopkeepers...
what kind of neighborhood is this?
I didn't want to come empty-handed.
Every shop I visited,
something happened, Asuman.
I wanted to buy şöbiyet.
I asked, "Do you have şöbiyet?"
But İnanç Patisserie has only kadayıf.
So I bought kadayıf.
And that liquor shop
at the head of the parallel street.
They are not side by side,
but on different streets.
First I went for one,
then the other, and the other.
I got tired as hell.
They ruined everything.
My mood is all gone, I'm done.
Here, I could only buy a tonic. Sorry.
Hope you can make a cocktail.
Come in, Mr. Koşu.
Asuman, I need to ask a favor of you.
Do you have any spare sweatpants
and a t-shirt?
I sweat like a pig.
I need to take a shower.
I'm soaking wet.
From my inner thighs to my knees.
I'm dripping with sweat, and...
I need to... I don't know how to ask this,
but if you have a razor...
razor blade.
If it's possible.
-Come in, Dizdar.
-Thank you.
Thank you so much.
But you didn't shave.
I did.
-All right, then. Shall I sit there?
-Sure.
Scientists have been researching this
for years, okay?
"Where is this G-spot?"
I had a good reputation back in the US.
People would say, "Dizdar Koşu can
find the G-spot blindfolded."
Once, my brother
came to visit me with his family.
We went out,
my brother, his wife and kids.
Five or six women stopped me.
"Dizdar, we won't accept no
for an answer. You're with us tonight."
What would you do, Asuman?
My brother says,
"We thought you were here to study.
But look at what you're doing."
His wife and kids were there.
I wish you knew. I've been through a lot.
The area that you call G-spot...
Where is that G-spot?
-Where is it?
-Where is that G-spot?
-You tell me, where is the G-spot?
-If I knew, I wouldn't ask. Where is it?
Do you want me to tell you where it is?
Firstly, you know the anal area.
From there...
it's right behind that...
-Is it over there?
-Sure.
-Right there?
-Of course it depends on the person.
But, usually, yes.
I received a message.
-You, too?
-I guess they sent it to the group.
It says, "We may have an urgent raid.
Stay vigilant."
It says a raid?
So, what do we do?
Shall we wait until the news comes,
or should we go to bed?
Go to bed? Do you want to go to bed?
-Together?
-No, you can have our bed.
What do you mean "our"?
I don't understand.
What do you mean "our"?
-Sener and I.
-You've got a dog?
-He's my son.
-How old is he?
-He's five, God bless him.
-Is it a breed of some sort?
Just a boy.
-You've got a cat? Cat--
-He's five, a boy.
-I have a kid. A five-year-old son.
-You have a kid?
-You have a kid?
-I have a kid.
-You have a kid then?
-I have a kid.
What kind of a woman are you, Asuman?
-Me?
-Shame on you!
-Shame on you!
-I don't understand.
You should be ashamed. You're married
with kids, but still inviting men
-to your house to drink and have fun.
-Are you talking to me?
-Get out of here!
-Watch your mouth.
-Get out!
-Watch your mouth!
-I'm drunk. Don't make me hit you.
-Bite me, sunshine!
-Get out of my sight!
-"Sunshine"?
-Get out of here!
-Did you say "sunshine"?
What sunshine?
-Do I bring everyone home?
-Damn you!
-God damn you!
-How can you speak to me like this?
-Get lost!
-How dare you!
-I'll smack you right in the face!
-Come on!
-Right in the face!
-Still waiting!
I will beat you up!
What did you do to me, girl?
Oh, God.
You ruined us.
But you get me so mad sometimes.
-Where's the father?
-In Artvin.
What's he doing in Artvin?
He lives there.
So, you got divorced?
-Yes.
-Good.
Where is Selahattin?
They're on the way.
-What about Emin?
-He's on his way as well.
He'll be here soon.
-Asuman?
-Calling her.
Dizdar?
I don't know. Should I call him?
I thought Asuman could pick him up.
But let me call him.
Sure, call him.
-Call him.
-I'm calling.
Ask where they are.
-So, we're the only ones here.
-Yes.
Great, really.
Hello?
Yes? Who?
Alaaddin.
What's up?
What... Alaaddin.
We're on our way. Yes.
I picked Dizdar up.
Dizdar.
Dizdar. Get up.
We're going on that raid.
Asuman, I'm so sorry.
-Please--
-I didn't expect you.
-I apologize.
-Please, Dizdar.
Asuman, we have to take the right turn.
Stay to the right.
I'll clear a path.
Let us through.
Let us through. Just slow down a bit.
Dude, slow down!
We'll take the right turn. Hang on.
Asuman, could you please use the horn?
They won't listen.
Slow down! Stop!
Slow down, let us through!
We'll get in line. Just let us through.
Slow down! Don't you understand!
God!
I'm sorry for shouting, but...
You did great.
Otherwise, we would miss the turn.
Believe me, Asuman, they are like bandits.
You need to talk to them like this.
So, please forgive me.
If not, I wouldn't yell beside you.
But we could have missed the turn.
Not at all. This morning,
I saw a different side of Dizdar.
Just hang in there,
I'll introduce you to more of me.
Selahattin and the team are ready.
They're waiting for our signal.
We're going in.
Asuman!
Asuman! What is this?
I don't understand! They followed us!
I don't know what's happening!
Get rid of this crowd!
Salih!
Salih!
How are we doing?
What did you say?
Don't you see what's going on?
-"How are we doing?" Get rid of them!
-Salih!
-Get rid of the crowd!
-How can I?
How can I get rid of them?
God damn you!
You fucked up the operation!
Where's Alaaddin? Pardon me.
Where's Alaaddin?
Salih. Chief!
Chief!
Move out! Move!
What should we do?
-Chief!
-Selahattin!
-Chief!
-Selahattin, I'm here!
Suspect has escaped, Chief.
-Where did he go?
-He took the front door.
-Oh, come on!
-He's running away!
-I can't hear, Selahattin!
-He's at the end of the street!
I can't hear! I can't!
I'm a cop! Move out! I can't breathe.
Get me out of here! Alaaddin!
Make way for police! Police!
Alaaddin!
I can't breathe!
Come on! Come this away!
Don't you understand? Make way!
I don't understand.
I really do not understand anything.
This is not over, you two.
Because of you, we almost lost him.
We'll discuss this later.
This isn't over yet.
I was in a meeting with the Ankara team.
We have some strong evidence and clues.
Don't screw this up.
Is that true? Are they too strong?
Why would I lie about this, Salih?
I don't know, Chief. What if he's just
a smuggler like in the last operation?
-How reliable is that call?
-Salih, we'll consider each call
and each clue.
Even if he's a smuggler or a crook.
We'll go after him
because we don't have any choice.
There's a lady there.
She claims to be in contact
with our killer online.
-She claims so.
-What does she say, Chief?
Not much yet.
We need to take her statement.
No, I wrote to him first.
Look, this is important. Think.
Was it you?
Yes, I wrote first.
-Do you remember when that was?
-No, I don't.
You don't. I see.
What did you write exactly?
I send a smiley first.
-İsmail?
-Who?
Who is İsmail?
-I didn't say İsmail.
-You said İsmail.
No, you did.
Oh, I said smiley.
We'll call the press in today.
You and your team will be there.
We need to make a statement.
-Okay?
-Sure, Chief.
I believe we can get something
out of here.
-Okay, let's see.
-Yes.
-What did he say?
-Well, he said...
"I see...
something different in you."
Something like that.
Different how?
I'm not sure.
-Right.
-Right.
Maybe you find it hard
to talk about that in here.
Maybe we can try
a different approach. Well...
Give us your username and password,
so we can look into your messages.
I can give you my username,
but not my password.
Why is that?
I don't share my password with anyone.
Sure, me neither,
but you're in a police station.
I can't share my password.
I also talked to my lawyer.
He warned me about that.
I don't have to give my password.
Sure.
You don't have to? The fuck you don't.
Oh, man. I dare you not to.
She says she doesn't have to.
I dare her not to.
Don't worry, we'll take it from you.
We sure will.
You fucking whore.
How can you talk to me like this?
What is this? You animal!
Impudent fool! Shame on you!
Is this the Wild West?
What kind of talk is that?
Pull yourself together!
Animal!
What a creep!
-Can she hear us?
-She can see you as well.
-This is not an interrogation room.
-No, it isn't.
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Why would I say anything?
So, why didn't we go in there?
We're just standing here.
You could.
Okay, keep going. Keep going.
Are you a moron?
-Okay, I'm writing to him.
-Okay.
When he answers, we'll start chatting
and arrange for a meeting.
Other than that, we'll look at
whatever comes up. A signal, a place.
If you want, I can handle this.
No, I can do it, Mr. Koşu. Don't worry.
What should I say? "Hi"?
No, say, "Hello."
-Just jump right in.
-What should I say?
-I'll suck you off.
-What the hell is that?
Okay, don't say that, but... I don't know.
-Type, "My hands are in my jeans."
-Why jeans?
No, just say, "How are you?
I miss you so much."
"I miss you" is good.
"I miss you." Okay.
-He replied.
-He did!
He replied. What did he say?
"Inside or outside?"
What does that mean?
"I miss you." "Inside or outside?"
I'd say, "inside." I think so.
Right. So, by "inside"
he means... that, right?
It should be inside.
Right. But for now,
just say, "Both inside and outside."
And say, "Where are you?"
Please, Chief.
You can't ask that right away.
Say, "inside."
"But you told me it was outside,
have you made me a stranger now?"
We should have said "outside."
No, just wait.
"No, I would never do that.
Please, don't get me wrong."
Okay, it's not a big deal.
He sent a smiley, so, he's not mad.
-What did he say?
-"What are you wearing?"
-What are you wearing?
-What?
-What could it be?
-I have no idea.
I don't know, you tell me.
What are we wearing?
Well...
-A beautiful chemise.
-No, I'll just say that I'm naked.
What is "I'm naked"?
Are you always naked at home?
Just say, "I got a skirt and high-heels."
-Say, "I have garters."
-So now we wear high heels at home.
You know what? Just say,
"I have nothing on but my skin."
-Let's play tricky here.
-Cool.
-"I have nothing on but my skin."
-Yes, it's good. Write that.
Write it. Okay.
-He'll go offline, send that quickly.
-I've sent it.
-"Are you wearing what I bought for you?"
-Say, "Yes."
But he'll ask about it.
I wonder what he sent her.
-I bet it's lingerie.
-Don't write anything.
Just send a smiley. Just a smiley.
You're becoming good at it.
-He typed.
-"What do you want?"
-What do we want?
-Make love.
Please. "Make love"? Really?
It's old-fashioned. No one says that.
-Fuck me!
-What?
-"Fuck me." That's it.
-Do I just write "Fuck me"?
-Just say, "Fuck me."
-Isn't it a bit harsh?
Why is it harsh?
We're just being direct. "Fuck me."
Okay, then. Shall I say,
"Fuck me" or just "Fuck"?
-"Fuck."
-"Fuck me."
Or we can say, "You to fuck me."
Because he asked what we want.
Like saying, "I want you to fuck me."
-Even better.
-Write that.
-What are you doing here?
-What?
What do you mean?
The press is here. It's packed.
-The chief was asking for you.
-No.
-What do you mean, "No"?
-Asuman, get lost!
-We're having a correspondence, get out!
-Correspondence?
Asuman, get out of here.
And do not come back for a while.
Get out!
-Quickly!
-Go on.
-Now what?
-Well...
What did we say last?
We were trying to decide on what to say.
Shall we say "Fuck" or "Fuck me"?
But we need to be fast.
He's asking for a video call.
Don't answer, don't answer!
Okay, I won't. I won't do anything.
-He wants a video call, right?
-Yes, he wants to see us.
We need to answer.
We can see the man. Answer it!
-How can I?
-Just face the camera to the window.
-We can see the man.
-No, Chief.
-The camera is right here. If I turn--
-What are you doing?
That's fine.
What are we going to do? Damn.
Maybe we can put something on your head
so you can pretend to be a woman.
-How come? I have beard.
-He has beard. We need a woman.
We need to find a woman.
I wish we hadn't sent away Asuman. Asuman!
What's that got to do with her?
It's not fucking right
to put one of us at risk.
-What?
-Please, don't be ridiculous.
-How can you talk to me like this?
-He'll know what she looks like.
Here! He hung up and blocked us.
Now he is offline.
Sure he did!
Enough with the "fucking"!
You did not write what I said!
"Fuck me."
So simple. "Fuck me!"
Would that have hurt you?
We would still be talking.
"Fuck me!"
Was it too hard?
My God!
"Fuck me!" You were just supposed
to say that. "Fuck me!"
COLORFUL MURDERS
Ladies and gentlemen of the press.
Today, we have gathered here to talk about
a series of abominable murders that have
been committed over a period of time.
First of all, I want to say this.
It's just a matter of time for us
to catch this killer.
We've got him cornered.
Of course, I hope you will understand
that I will not be able to give you
more information
due to the confidentiality
of the operation.
Our forces are vigilant.
ISTANBUL POLICE DEPARTMENT
This monster who disturbs
the peace of our people
will be caught and brought to justice.
No one should doubt that.
In the meantime, I need to make...
-Chief?
-...an important request.
An eyewitness has shown up,
they're holding him.
-Who showed up?
-An eyewitness.
-Where did they keep him?
-They locked him up downstairs.
Which eye is that?
Chief, we have just heard.
There is an eyewitness wanting to see us.
-Did he have an eye on the woman?
-Which woman?
Do you mean the one we questioned?
-Did we question a woman?
-Who did you talk to?
-No, the witness is a man.
-God!
We've talked with a man.
That's what I said.
There is a man.
-Is that man here?
-No, he's not talking about that.
There is a man who saw the man.
He's talking about him.
No, this is another man. An older one.
The man we talked to, was he old?
Who did you talk to?
What does it matter?
Everyone is looking at us.
No, just an ordinary old man.
He's the eyewitness. He saw the killer.
Thank you. Mr. Koşu, please.
Dear citizens, Mr. Commissioner,
my colleagues...
ladies and gentlemen
of the press, welcome.
Mr. Commissioner has summarized
the situation very well.
I totally agree with what he said.
But I have a few words...
for that jackass killer.
I'd like to express them,
if you'll excuse me.
Look, man!
You're sitting on a time bomb now.
You'll see what you're up against
when that timer strikes zero.
You'll break! You'll start talking!
You'll tell us everything. You'll confess
every crime you have ever committed.
And you'll shatter like a wall of glass.
You will tell us everything you know,
one by one!
You will beg us, dude.
You will beg us!
Who the hell are you? Who?
-Fucking animal!
-What the hell is he saying?
Fucking animal!
You bastard! You impudent man!
Shameless villain!
I am calling out to all the criminals.
Damn you!
Damn you!
God damn you!
Champ...
let's stop that time bomb together.
Come here and surrender.
Let's not hurt anyone else. Thank you.
After I saw that man,
I saw him again on the news,
at that same place
where I learned they had found a body.
I had a bad feeling.
Why not? What is that old saying?
"'Can the sea burn?'
They said, 'It's possible, Your Majesty.'"
So, basically,
"Mardin needs hay, hay needs Mardin."
Nice. Go on.
There is a forest
right beside the highway.
I was just at the edge of it.
And it was around 4.00 or 4:15 a.m.
-At night?
-Night.
-It was almost dawn.
-Which highway is that? Is it TEM?
-No, not that one. The other one.
-He's talking about E5.
-Please go on.
-Sir, I want to ask something.
On a night like that,
what were you doing out there?
Good question. I am interested in birds.
You know, there are goldfinches, siskins,
as well as golden orioles and wagtails.
Sir, skip those parts. Please.
I was done.
I was smoking a cigarette,
and then I heard a voice.
I was all eyes and ears.
There was a voice coming from the bushes.
Suddenly, I had goosebumps.
Look up "to have goosebumps"?
I was wondering what it was,
a pig or a hyena?
I got up slowly, like this.
While feeling the ground with my hand,
-I discovered a knotty wood.
-Wood? Okay, talk about the man.
-It was a mop stick.
-Tell us what you saw.
Let's fast-forward a little bit.
I've raised my stick.
Suddenly, I saw a man.
We were face-to-face,
but my socks got knocked off with fear.
You knocked your socks off?
-Was he scary?
-He wasn't. He was cool.
But as I wasn't expecting him,
he scared the daylights out of me.
-Would you recognize him if you saw him?
-Oh, yes.
-Right that instant.
-Okay.
You have to tell us about that guy.
Describe the man's face.
He had a familiar face,
medlar-like cheeks.
His skin was like a pomegranate,
as if he had been beaten.
-He had hedik-colored hair.
-God, what is hedik?
What is hedik for heaven's sake?
And his clothes...
His clothes, my dear Commissioner,
-were all black.
-Chief?
-I got something like this.
-What is that? Is this what he described?
I don't know, I just draw as he says.
Chief, we got something like this, but--
-Let me see.
-What's the problem?
What is this?
Have a look at him. Is that him?
Who is he?
I suppose he can't draw very well.
-His face is a little longer.
-Long! Make it longer!
-He had a light gray beard.
-Light gray! Make it white.
-Like a hammered copper bowl.
-Hammered...
-Let me look it up.
-Rounded but kinda narrow like a batten.
You know a snap melon? It was like that.
How are we supposed to know
the shape of a snap melon?
-What about his hair?
-Was it that long?
-He didn't have much hair?
-Didn't he?
Is that him? Let him see. Is that him?
Have a look at him.
Okay, that's it. That is the fool.
-Are you sure? Is that the same guy?
-Yes, it is him.
Alaaddin, print one to two hundred copies,
distribute them to all units.
We're going to Tahtakale.
Move, we're going to Tahtakale right now!
That bastard will surely come back
to that paint store!
He will! Put out an APB!
This ends now, folks!
ISTANBUL POLICE DEPARTMENT
Okay. All right.
Yes, go on. Come on.
What is that? Too big.
I just wanted a small bottle.
I also got us paper cups, Chief.
I am also thirsty.
Instead of getting four small ones,
I got one big bottle.
There are 19-liter bottles available, too.
You should've gotten that.
We could have used a pump every time.
If it's really such a big deal,
I can return it.
Dude, don't do that. Don't act like that.
We will chase the suspect.
Where will we put this big bottle?
I was referring to that.
Right?
Chief, something's happened.
Do you remember the man
we talked to on the internet?
He is a friend of Hüseyin from CSI.
-What are you talking about?
-I swear.
He sent him a photo from the crime scene
just to appear cool.
Idiot.
So that he can get girls on Facebook.
How could that happen?
God damn you, Alaaddin.
That's all I can say.
Alaaddin, run!
Run, Alaaddin!
Clear the way!
Squads.
Move!
Catch him! Catch him!
Go!
Asuman, run!
Run, run!
Asuman! Tell everyone!
He's going towards Salih!
Suspect is going towards Chief Salih!
What are you doing? There are civilians!
What the fuck is that?
-Salih!
-Sir!
-Salih, he is coming!
-Chief, he is coming!
-Salih!
-Chief!
-Salih!
-Chief!
Alaaddin! Has he done something
to the Chief? Check him!
-Keep going!
-Go check!
Salih!
Salih!
-What?
-What are you doing?
I sleep at this time every day.
Fulya hasn't woken up yet.
-She doesn't wake up at that time.
-You're sleeping! The man was here!
-Which man?
-The killer passed by you.
What? Damn!
I told you not to make me wait for him!
I told you I haven't slept!
-Where did he go?
-This way!
I told you I needed to sleep!
I told you to let me rest a while!
I have enough troubles of my own!
-I told you not to make me wait!
-Okay, move!
I passed out!
This is completely fucked up!
I repeat, this is completely fucked up!
And I'm saying it to you specifically.
This is completely,
yes, completely fucked up!
Do you understand me?
-Sir, let me--
-To hell with your "sir"!
-Chief--
-Shut up! Don't you ever talk!
-If you'll excuse me--
-What excuse?
I said this is fucked up! That's it!
-But I need to say that--
-You don't need to do anything, Dündar!
Stay out of this! Look, guys.
I am giving you one final week.
By the end of the week,
you'd better have brought this killer in.
If you don't,
just hand in your resignations!
Now, go somewhere
and make your plan together or...
Whatever you do,
just find him and bring him in.
Go now! Get out!
Understood. Come on, team, let's talk.
Excuse us, Chief.
Asuman.
It was very tense. Shall we go somewhere?
Like where?
I don't know.
Maybe we can drink something.
I'm not used to such treatment
at the workplace. Not a bit.
This is an intense job.
It affected all of us.
I'm not very good, either.
You're good. You're so good.
You're perfectly fine.
You got nothing to worry about.
You are something else.
But you're not reacting at all.
To what?
You're not reacting at all.
That's not my leg, Dizdar.
-It's the table.
-What?
I'm so sorry.
I put myself in an awkward situation.
Sorry about that.
You know what, Dizdar?
You got me through these difficult times.
I really can't thank you enough for it.
Want to have public sex?
What?
Public sex.
-What do you say?
-What?
Well, I don't know, really.
Like a typical one.
Oh, my goodness.
What's the matter? Come on.
People do it all the time
in the USA and in Europe.
But how...
Okay, whatever.
Anyway, I'll go get the car.
Shall we go to the parking lot?
Shall I come with you?
So?
Let me get the car. You can wait here.
I mean it.
Excuse me?
Anyone? Help!
My love?
Dizdar!
There's a bomb under me! A bomb!
Asuman, I can't hear you.
I guess that's because of the parking...
-He placed a bomb under my car.
-Send a message. A message.
Send a text message, okay?
Someone help me, please!
THERE'S A BOMB UNDER ME!!
Don't worry, I'll explode that bomb.
DON'T WORRY, I'LL EXPLODE THAT BOMB.
DIZDAR I AM ABOUT TO EXPLODE!
COME HERE NOW!
I told you that you would explode.
I said I'd come along to the parking lot!
I SAID LET'S GO TOGETHER...
WHATEVER. WAIT FOR ME.
I'LL COME RIGHT AWAY.
LET'S EXPLODE THAT BOMB.
A REAL BOMB! TIME BOMB!
CALL EVERYONE,
I'M ON THE BASEMENT 3
AND GET HELP!!!
Asuman!
Dizdar!
Asuman!
Where? Where is the bomb?
Where is the bomb? Where?
Under the seat.
Oh, Asuman.
Relax, don't panic.
I've called for help. They're on the way.
Calm down, okay?
Asuman, why don't we run away right now?
Is it worth it for an old car?
Dizdar, how could it be for the car?
I heard a sound when I sat down.
If I get up, the bomb might explode.
Run. Please, go. I'm begging you.
-Do you mean it?
-Yeah.
Run. We cannot do anything. Save yourself.
That's right, but...
This is so unfortunate. Hell.
But how can I leave you?
How can I do that? If I leave you now,
I won't forgive myself. No.
I cannot forgive myself. Just relax.
Please. We will figure it out.
Don't panic. They're coming here.
What does the clock say? Two minutes left.
Okay. We still have two minutes.
Calm down.
-Yeah, Emin.
-Hello, Dizdar...
I cannot hear you. Wait a second.
Can you hear me now, Chief?
I can hear you. Hell.
How is Asuman, is she okay?
Chief, just be quick.
The clock right now says two minutes
and thirty-two seconds left.
Look, Dizdar. Are you sure?
Is this a bomb?
Yes, it's a bomb. A time bomb.
Asuman cannot move
because she is sitting on it.
You know, it might explode.
But I am free now.
God damn it.
I can run away, actually.
Okay, now I will give the phone
to a bomb-disposal expert.
He will lead you. Calm down.
May God help you.
Calm down. Don't panic.
Whatever happens, happens.
-Can Asuman hear me?
-Chief, keep it short. Give the phone.
Yeah, Chief. Thank you. Thank you.
I send my love to all of you. Kisses.
-Heaven forbid.
-Give him the phone, they'll die!
-Mr. Koşu, what do you see?
-I was pepping them up.
There is a bomb in front of me.
I'm seeing a bomb.
I can run away right now.
What else do you see?
There is a clock.
Mr. Koşu, is there a connection?
There is a bomb and a clock, a countdown.
And a connection.
Yes, there is a connection.
-What kind of a...
-Hold him?
What kind of a connection is that?
Well, it is...
How would I know? It's a bomb.
There is a clock and cables.
Mr. Koşu, does one of them
go under the bomb?
He fell down! Help!
-Fuck!
-Those cables...
Help him!
-I'm under him. Pull him up!
-Mr. Koşu.
My foot is stuck. My foot!
Pull him up!
-Step on his foot.
-One second.
-The radio is back there.
-Mr. Koşu...
Does one of them go under the bomb?
Yeah, all of them.
Okay, calm down.
Tell me what color they are.
Okay, I'm starting from the left.
Light pink, fuchsia, ecru, rosé,
salmon, magnolia.
I don't understand.
These are the colors.
Dizdar, tell us the colors one more time!
We didn't understand!
-I dropped the phone.
-You...
-What the fuck?
-I'll get it.
-I dropped the phone.
-Wait. I got it. I got the phone.
-Stop.
-Mr. Koşu.
-Mr. Koşu!
-Got it. Put him on speaker.
-Put him on speaker. Dizdar!
-Touch that button.
We cannot understand.
You're breaking up. Colors!
What is it you didn't understand
about the colors?
Fuchsia, like a dark brown. And salmon.
-Are there any green, blue or red cables?
-Are there any green, blue or red cables?
Dizdar, tell us the colors,
like green, blue, red.
Did I...
Did I say green, blue or red?
What are we talking about?
-What is fuchsia, Dizdar?
-Damn, I'm telling you once more.
Light pink, fuchsia, ecru, salmon,
rosé, magnolia!
Tell us colors like green, blue, red.
Aren't there cables there?
Fuchsia, dark pink.
Why are you showing it to me?
Fuck, show it to the expert.
Dark pink?
What are we doing? How?
-Is it dark pink?
-But it's closer to red.
What are we doing? Time is running out.
It's about to explode.
What do we do now?
-Cut one randomly.
-No, no, no!
-No, Chief.
-Don't cut them.
Do you say so?
-At least the red one...
-No, no.
Asuman! Asuman! I loved you!
How much I loved you!
-I loved you so much!
-I was preparing myself for you.
I was going to invite you to my home
on the 15th of this month.
I was going to sleep with you.
We could have slept together
the other night, we could have!
We couldn't have done it that night.
We had to wait until the 15th.
-That is today.
-Yeah, moron.
Damn! Fuck!
God! Please hear us!
-I fucking love you!
-Asuman!
We were going to make love for months!
For months!
I want to hold you and put you inside me!
Come to me, then! Come on.
Come here, woman!
Come here!
There is no sound.
Did it explode?
We would've heard it.
Asuman, are you okay?
We are on our way! We're coming!
These are the numbers that we have.
What is that?
Why did that man put these numbers
into the bomb? That is the question.
-He's trying to tell us something, Chief.
-What?
It's a code. It's coded.
It's clear that it is a code.
These numbers mean something, for sure.
Yeah, Ankara. What do you think?
It looks like a code to me, too.
If it is a code rather than some numbers,
it'd be a simple one.
Eleven, twenty-one, fifty-one--
In such numeral codes,
each number is usually a letter,
right, Bahar?
-Bengü.
-Bengü?
These are not numbers. They are scores.
-What score?
-Put dashes among them.
1-1, 2-1, 5-1. Football scores!
Look. '91-92 season of Beşiktaş.
-Check the league table.
-I am checking.
I know what it is.
It is the year that we were undefeated.
Okay, we can check it. It looks possible.
-But why?
-We will check it. I don't know.
What are we going to do, guys?
When we think of what we have,
we have Besiktas.
-Which season was it?
-'91-92, for sure.
That's it.
In Besiktas, around buildings 91-92.
There is a clue there.
Look, 83, 85, 87. This is 89. Okay?
-And this is 93. Where is 91, Asuman?
-There is a fountain here.
Fine, let's check it anyway.
Is there anything in the basin?
How could there be
a number for a fountain?
What should we do, Chief?
Wait a second.
I'm checking the numbers.
We have up to eight. Not eight, seven.
Up to seven. Do you see?
How many musical notes are there?
Four.
Seven. We have seven notes.
And we have seven numbers.
The highest one is seven. Look.
Zero is C.
One is D. Two is E.
E, D, D, D.
D, D, D, E, D.
It's a melody.
The signature of the murderer.
What are we going to do with it?
What? He is right.
It might be a song that we all know.
And there might be a hidden message
in that song.
-I've found it. Shall I play it?
-Yeah.
Wait a second. What was that?
I know it.
Before you
Before you and after you
There was a song like that.
Before you and after you
There is no song like that.
There isn't.
-Isn't there?
-No.
Whatever. Stop it. There is nothing in it.
What are we going to do then?
Fuck!
-Dude, fuck!
-What happened?
How could I miss it?
What happened?
-These are coordinates.
-What coordinates?
Look. I'm writing these here.
Where do these numbers show on the map?
Iğdır.
What about Iğdır?
It shows a hill up north in Iğdır.
Wait. One second. Yeah.
-That's it.
-Do you think we've found it?
Yeah, right. We've found it.
We have a description and location.
What else do we need?
Is he killing these men in Iğdır?
I'm saying no such thing.
What do you think, Chief?
Have you seen this man?
No, I haven't.
I'll destroy you, Alaaddin.
This is impossible.
There is some trick here.
Look at us. What the fuck?
What is that? Chief!
Could these be phone numbers? Possible.
"Possible."
Look here, that's enough. Stop talking.
I'll kick the shit out of you.
What have I done to you?
You brought us to Iğdır!
But you said, "Let's go there," Chief.
Fuck off! Don't ever speak again!
Here is the situation.
We have a spy. Here in the van among us.
-What spy?
-A spy.
There is a spy.
There isn't any other explanation.
Are you a fucking moron?
Are you a fucking moron?
What the fuck is that? You're new here.
We don't even know where you come from.
If there is a spy here, it must be you.
-Okay, go on.
-I will.
Come on. Spill it. Very good.
Very good. Do you have more?
Alaaddin? Do you want to say something?
Chief, if you'll permit me,
I want to ask Mr. Koşu something.
The night before the operation,
where were you?
You came to the crime scene
together with Asuman?
-Yeah?
-Good. Nice try, but useless.
So, the day before the operation,
we were at Asuman's place.
-And she is here with us.
-Wow.
-Ask her. Isn't that right, Asuman?
-What? That's not true, Chief.
Of course not. For goodness' sake.
They heard us talking
when we were dealing with the bomb.
Wait a minute.
How are we to know
that the bomb incident wasn't a hoax?
We couldn't see anything in the records.
-How? How could we--
-Wait a second.
We were together in the car, that's right.
There wasn't a bomb.
That's right. Then, I sat down.
Following that? Someone placed a bomb
under my seat.
-Interesting.
-Oh, my God!
Wasn't I with you, Asuman?
-When did I go there and place the bomb?
-Let me tell you.
He sent a message, from his cell phone,
saying, "Don't worry,
I'll explode that bomb."
Look at it. I'll show it to you.
-I'll show you.
-Is that what I meant?
What I meant was, "I'll fuck you."
I swear, it was just sexual.
This is too much!
Shame on you. Filthy woman!
Shut up!
Fuck.
Seher?
We are on our way back... from Iğdır.
There's nothing here.
Don't send everyone who says
"I am the murderer" to me.
What? What are you talking about?
Wait. Chief.
Someone's claiming to be the murderer.
Knows all about the numbers.
He's a match.
Get him.
Get him, Seher.
Put him on speaker.
-We're putting him on speaker, Seher.
-Why are you saying that?
Can you hear me?
Yes, we can.
How can we help you? I mean--
I'm your guy.
I'll send you a location.
I'll wait for you to get me from there
in one hour.
One hour is not enough. Let's stall him.
We cannot go there, Chief.
We are in Eastern Anatolia.
There's a problem with that.
We are out of town.
We're here for our friend's wedding.
A colleague...
So, well... because of that...
We wish we had known that before.
We were trying so hard to find you.
We couldn't find you.
So what are we doing? What should we do?
We're coming.
We'll be there in three or five hours.
-Wait for us.
-It won't even take that long.
In one or two hours, we'll be there.
I'll give you my e-mail address.
You send me the location.
My e-mail address is
dizdar@massachussets.com.
What?
I'll spell it, Mike, Alfa, Sierra...
Go ahead, Chief.
I will send the others over.
I guess there are no other exits.
-Aren't you going in before us?
-No. It's not necessary.
You go in first. We're here,
we'll come in after you.
Such a reluctant...
special team, Selahattin.
-We're going through hard times.
-Chief.
We've gathered a couple of times already.
We've gone along with you on a raid.
Empty buildings, mannequins.
I tie my laces in five minutes.
Wearing this vest takes ten minutes.
There are laces somewhere in here.
You cannot see it right now.
Ten minutes, I swear.
Wearing all of that takes 40 minutes.
It's the exact same thing every time.
Don't get me wrong. I swear.
All this equipment.
-You can go in through windows.
-I swear, we didn't bring any ropes.
-We don't have ropes.
-Okay. All right. But...
It's not cool, Selahattin. It's not cool.
Anyways. Salih,
let the man know we're here.
And then we are going in.
We don't have a choice.
What happened?
-They are not going in.
-Why?
-They don't have any ropes.
-Ropes?
-Yeah.
-Unbelievable.
God, what can I say?
What are we going to do?
God, kill me. Fuck the megaphone
and the ropes.
-Let's go in.
-Okay. Come on. We're going in.
We can say that it was procedure.
-Alaaddin and everything.
-Go on.
Hey!
Are you there?
Don't try to fool us.
Look.
Turn on the lights. What the fuck?
Should I get a flashlight from Selahattin?
Fuck Selahattin and the flashlight.
I can see.
-Chief.
-Yeah?
I've gotten entangled.
Something... save me.
I'm here. Something is biting me.
Save me. It's here. Pull.
What is happening?
Come on. Go.
-What is that?
-How did you get caught?
Just stop and wait for us, please, Salih.
Leave it.
-Jump.
-Inside?
-Come here.
-Where the fuck are you?
Cut it out with the show!
The day has come.
Today, here, and soon...
you will witness
the truth lost in a body,
its birth, its light,
its existence,
its journey to death,
again and again,
while its disappointment
slowly rises in all its glory.
Welcome.
Okay.
Let's start with the first crime scene.
The verses you left at the crime scene
and the paints left around the body.
All the bodies
are parts of a single piece of art.
Birth, growing up, and loneliness. Death.
And then coming back.
I cannot think of a more powerful way
of embellishing one's own loneliness
with a real death.
Get to the point.
Hence...
I gave the bodies a pseudo-life
by bringing them together
with a condition
that is the opposite of death.
What are you saying?
What the fuck are you saying?
What the hell?
I am listening, but I cannot understand.
What are you talking about?
Listen to yourself.
-Watch your words.
-Salih.
Out. What are you doing?
So?
I also gave these people
a final chance to scream for help.
Fuck your chance!
Let me go! Let go! What chance?
Are you sick?
Are you crazy? Stop pretending!
Start with the first murder.
Tell us. The first murder.
Tell the Chief all about it.
Salih, leave.
I feel like I am the only professional
in the whole building.
Not professional at all.
Mr. Koşu, you are putting yourself
in danger.
Hit me and see what happens.
Hit me and see.
Take him over there.
-Okay, sir. Let's go over there.
-Come on.
Please.
The voices that go unheard when alive,
are heard after death.
I will fuck his dead body!
Let me. I'll fuck his...
Salih, how can I question him like this?
Let go.
Sorry, Chief.
What? What's wrong?
Get him something, some ayran.
Look at him.
-Get him some ayran.
-Where from?
Get him ayran. Can we order some ayran?
-Get it. Ask someone.
-İbo!
How did you pick your victims?
They were lost at first.
No one looked for them.
And then they died.
No one heard.
I found them.
And I helped them ask the question
that they wanted to ask but couldn't.
"Who killed me?"
What?
"Who killed me?" What is he saying?
Maybe you cannot hear it
because of the sounds
-coming out of your mouth.
-I cannot hear either.
So sorry. I'm nervous. I apologize.
So you accept that you kept these people
captive for some time,
and then you killed them, right? Say it.
I didn't kill anyone.
Who did?
You will answer that question.
I am the one who is asking.
From now on,
you will tell me what happened,
one by one.
In a manner that we will all understand.
Sorry.
I found all those bodies in the landfill,
decorated them
and placed them in different places.
So I didn't kill anyone.
I just painted them.
I did all of this
to complete my artwork
that will be exhibited in Montreal...
to draw attention
to the unidentified murders that occur.
But when you found me and chased me,
I panicked.
I was not supposed to get caught
before completing my artwork.
So, to stall you,
I set up a code and a fake bomb.
ISTANBUL POLICE DEPARTMENT
So, I am not guilty. I didn't kill anyone.
I found those bodies in the landfill
and brought them to light.
I didn't leave them to be forgotten.
That's all.
Do you believe in this yourself?
Maybe you should visit
the city landfills.
City landfills?
Dump yards. City landfills.
Check them for yourself.
It turns out that the serial killer
who was thought to be responsible
for the embellished murders,
was an artist.
The real murderers are being hunted.
It turns out that the first victim, Ö.O.,
was actually strangled
by his wife and her lover.
And the second one, S.K.,
was murdered by his partner, T.Z.
The other murders are being solved
one at a time.
We will continue keeping you updated.
Good evening.
Alaaddin!
Chief, I've found a canister!
They threw a canister.
How can someone do that?
It must be empty.
Otherwise, why would they throw it?
-What should I do with it?
-Leave it there.
-I'm putting it here.
-Okay!
It's as if he's discovered a new planet.
Asuman, these gagging sounds
might be a good sign, what do you say?
This doesn't help, either.
This place smells awful.
This is a landfill. Sure, it will stink.
We were expecting that.
Did you expect it to smell of perfume?
Come, I'll hold you.
What are you wearing now?
Thick or thin stockings?
The thin one.
Be careful, you might catch a cold.
Oh, my.
