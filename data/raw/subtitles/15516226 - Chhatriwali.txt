<b>What a sense of humour!</b>
<b>Where do you work, son?</b>
<b>Actually...</b>
<b>I work at--</b>
<b>He works as a quality head in an MNC.</b>
<b>I see.</b>
<b>What's the name of the company?</b>
<b>The name of the company--</b>
<b>It's a very big and reputed company.</b>
<b>But what is it called?</b>
<b>Um...</b>
<b>Cando</b>
<b>Condoms.</b>
<b>Mr Lamba, this job will ruin my life.</b>
<b>I don't wish to do it any more.</b>
<b>I am requesting you.</b>
<b>No, I beg of you!</b>
<b>I will also give you a raise.</b>
<b>But please, don't quit this job.</b>
<b>I will not stay even if</b>
<b>this company is handed over to me.</b>
<b>Please, don't say that.</b>
<b>What should I tell</b>
<b>my friends and relatives?</b>
<b>What does he do?</b>
<b>He makes condoms.</b>
<b>You don't have to</b>
<b>berate the condoms.</b>
<b>I am never getting married</b>
<b>if I continue with this job.</b>
<b>Of course, you will get married,</b>
<b>but you will not find a job</b>
<b>as noble as this.</b>
<b>I am a college graduate, with Honours!</b>
<b>And there is something called, honour.</b>
<b>You will get honour here as well.</b>
<b>The factory is filled with it.</b>
<b>I will do anything but work</b>
<b>at this seedy place.</b>
<b>Get out of my way.</b>
<b>Please!</b>
<b>You'll get hurt.</b>
<b>Shall I serve lunch?</b>

<b>Chemistry is very easy</b>
<b>once you understand it.</b>
<b>Can I show you something interesting?</b>
<b>Yes, Ma'am.</b>
<b>Do you really want to see it?</b>
<b>Yes, Ma'am.</b>
<b>-Yes, Ma'am.</b>
<b>Can I have a rupee bill?</b>
<b>-Sure.</b>
<b>Here you go.</b>
<b>Hey, now my father will kill me!</b>
<b>How did you do this magic trick?</b>
<b>It's not a magic trick.</b>
<b>It's just chemistry.</b>
<b>Ethanol would have burnt the bill.</b>
<b>So, we added some water.</b>
<b>So, ethanol burnt away and the bill</b>
<b>is intact!</b>
<b>Come on!</b>
<b>Write down the chemical formula</b>
<b>of ethanol.</b>
<b>Hey, what are you doing?</b>
<b>-Mum needs it on the terrace.</b>
<b>Wait!</b>
<b>Get back to the formula.</b>
<b>Wait! Where are you going?</b>
<b>Give it back.</b>
<b>Praise the Lord!</b>
<b>Wait!</b>
<b>Here you go, Mum.</b>
<b>-Oh, hell!</b>
<b>Mum!</b>
<b>Mum!</b>
<b>How many times</b>

<b>Yesterday, you lost a jar in the game.</b>
<b>And yet, here we are.</b>
<b>Are you going to bet on us next?</b>
<b>Your mother is about to pull a miracle.</b>
<b>This move will win back</b>

<b>Hey, loser gang!</b>

<b>Else, I will make sure that</b>

<b>How many times have I told you</b>

<b>I am managing it, right?</b>
<b>Oh, sure.</b>
<b>Your measly tutoring jobs are</b>

<b>Of course, not.</b>
<b>Obviously, gambling is the best way</b>

<b>A billionaire, it seems!</b>

<b>KALRA PUJA SHOP</b>

<b>Greetings.</b>
<b>Please, don't do that!</b>
<b>An employer should not greet</b>
<b>an employee like this.</b>
<b>I say this every day,</b>
<b>but you never listen.</b>
<b>Uncle, we are answerable to Him,</b>
<b>this is where I earn the money,</b>
<b>and this is how I earn my blessings.</b>
<b>God bless you. I'm going down,</b>
<b>call me if you need anything.</b>
<b>-Okay.</b>
<b>Chotu!</b>
<b>-Yes, sir.</b>
<b>Go down and get a carton.</b>
<b>There is an order to be delivered.</b>
<b>I'll tell you the list.</b>
<b>Dad,</b>
<b>please, keep this.</b>
<b>Rishi,</b>
<b>'bhaiji' had called.</b>
<b>He has asked you to attend</b>
<b>Amit's engagement this evening.</b>
<b>Make sure that you don't forget it,</b>
<b>or else the volcano named,</b>
<b>'bhaiji' will erupt once again.</b>
<b>Yes, I will go.</b>
<b>Chotu, note this down.</b>
<b>Five thousand lamps,</b>
<b>twenty-five kilos of almonds,</b>
<b>ten thousand incense sticks,</b>
<b>two hundred kilos of ghee,</b>
<b>Please, write it down.</b>
<b>Yes, sir.</b>
<b>-Okay.</b>
<b>Two sacks of mango wood.</b>
<b>Make sure it's mango wood,</b>
<b>and not sandalwood.</b>
<b>It's for a wedding, not a funeral.</b>
<b>It doesn't make any difference, sir.</b>
<b>He is set for my doom.</b>
<b>Are all the messages ready?</b>
<b>Yes, the marketing campaign</b>
<b>is ready to go.</b>
<b>The messages of 'Good morning',</b>
<b>'Good afternoon', and 'Good evening'</b>
<b>placed on the background images of</b>
<b>Lords Ganesha, Goddess Laxmi,</b>
<b>and Lord Shankar.</b>
<b>The name of the shop,</b>
<b>'Kalra Puja Shop' will be</b>
<b>at the bottom,</b>
<b>along with your phone number.</b>
<b>Add my name as well.</b>
<b>-Okay, sir.</b>
<b>Dad,</b>
<b>please, give the bike keys to Pintu</b>
<b>when he comes.</b>
<b>He will get it serviced.</b>
<b>I'll be back in a bit.</b>
<b>Where are you going?</b>
<b>Mahavir Nagar.</b>
<b>A priest hasn't paid his dues.</b>
<b>Instead, he just sends his blessings</b>
<b>on WhatsApp.</b>
<b>Let me seek his blessings in person.</b>
<b>Please, take this seat.</b>
<b>You must be tired from</b>
<b>running after the bus.</b>
<b>You must be getting late for work--</b>
<b>-Are you hitting on me?</b>
<b>Excuse me?</b>
<b>You are misunderstanding me.</b>
<b>I just saw that you--</b>
<b>-Really?</b>
<b>Based on my clothes,</b>
<b>you took me for a modern girl.</b>
<b>And you assumed that</b>
<b>I must be an easy girl.</b>
<b>You give up your seat</b>
<b>only for pretty girls, right?</b>
<b>That's not true.</b>
<b>You are misunderstanding me...</b>
<b>It's cut!</b>
<b>Dad, a bill of 2000 rupees!</b>
<b>Mr Lamba,</b>
<b>look closely.</b>
<b>It must be a 1000-rupee bill,</b>
<b>gone obsolete after demonetization.</b>
<b>No, it is a 2000-rupee bill.</b>
<b>Wait, I'll just show you.</b>
<b>Hey!</b>
<b>Hey, you!</b>
<b>Yes, you!</b>
<b>Why are you cheating?</b>
<b>Why did you use that rock?</b>
<b>Hey!</b>
<b>Dad, this string is</b>
<b>like a hardened felon!</b>
<b>It's just not cracking!</b>
<b>Let’s try a bit harder.</b>
<b>It's just not breaking!</b>
<b>Uncle!</b>
<b>Uncle!</b>
<b>Uncle!</b>
<b>Uncle!</b>
<b>Are you calling me?</b>
<b>Yes, you!</b>
<b>If you don't know how to fly a kite,</b>
<b>try a balloon!</b>
<b>Why did you have to cheat</b>
<b>using that rock?</b>
<b>It's you who is cheating, not me!</b>
<b>You are clearly using a metal string!</b>
<b>Uncle,</b>
<b>could a kite</b>
<b>attached to a metal string ever fly?</b>
<b>Here's a thing,</b>
<b>come on up and break it.</b>
<b>If you succeed, you can have</b>
<b>the 2000-rupee bill,</b>
<b>otherwise, the bill will be ours.</b>
<b>I'm coming up to show you.</b>
<b>Just keep a slice of lemon ready!</b>
<b>A lemon?</b>
<b>Does she want to have a lemonade?</b>
<b>Amazing!</b>
<b>Isn't it amazing?</b>
<b>How did you do this magic trick?</b>
<b>It's not a trick,</b>
<b>it's just chemistry.</b>
<b>I'll explain it.</b>
<b>'We have to apply C3H6 to increase</b>
<b>the tensile strength of the string.'</b>
<b>'C3H6 means, polypropylene.'</b>
<b>'When you get the spool,</b>
<b>just apply polypropylene</b>
<b>along the entire length of the string.'</b>
<b>'Polypropylene increases</b>
<b>the strength of the string.'</b>
<b>'And our string is ready!'</b>
<b>'Just stick a 2000-rupee bill</b>
<b>to your kite,</b>
<b>and watch it soar into the sky!'</b>
<b>It has been cut!</b>
<b>Isn't it amazing?</b>
<b>Come on, let me have my money.</b>
<b>Sure.</b>
<b>Please, hurry up!</b>
<b>-Here.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>This is what I like</b>
<b>about the young generation.</b>
<b>They include</b>
<b>smallest of the detail</b>
<b>while explaining</b>
<b>a chemical reaction.</b>
<b>By the way, what do you do?</b>
<b>I am a college graduate in chemistry.</b>
<b>But presently, I am working</b>
<b>as a chemistry tutor.</b>
<b>I can tutor your son.</b>
<b>He will be able crack the toughest</b>
<b>of the entrance tests, for sure!</b>
<b>Otherwise, he will continue wasting</b>
<b>his energy in these petty antics.</b>
<b>I must get going.</b>
<b>Did you see that?</b>
<b>Now, I don't have to run</b>
<b>from pillar to post.</b>
<b>The girl has been found!</b>
<b>But she is a girl.</b>
<b>You are planning on offering her</b>
<b>a job at the plant?</b>
<b>Do you wish to get beaten up?</b>
<b>Sattu,</b>
<b>nowadays, there is</b>
<b>no difference between genders.</b>
<b>And I really like this quality</b>
<b>about the young generation.</b>
<b>Don't worry.</b>
<b>I'll manage.</b>
<b>Okay, then.</b>
<b>You better manage it.</b>
<b>CHANGE THE WRONG JOB TO THE RIGHT ONE.</b>
<b>UPGRAD.</b>
<b>Uncle!</b>
<b>Oh, my!</b>
<b>Aren't you the chemistry tutor?</b>
<b>That's right.</b>
<b>Since that day,</b>
<b>I knew that you will</b>
<b>return with an offer.</b>
<b>Right.</b>
<b>The demonstration was</b>
<b>quite powerful, right?</b>
<b>Excuse me?</b>
<b>So, was that demonstration</b>
<b>given for my benefit?</b>
<b>I am so stupid.</b>
<b>I was stressed for no reason,</b>
<b>and I kept wondering</b>
<b>whether you'll agree to do it.</b>
<b>What are you saying?</b>
<b>Why wouldn't I do it?</b>
<b>To be honest,</b>
<b>there are no jobs</b>
<b>available in this city.</b>
<b>You know something?</b>
<b>One should not turn down a job offer.</b>
<b>Darling,</b>
<b>I really like this quality</b>
<b>about the young generation.</b>
<b>They don't accept an elapsing job,</b>
<b>and they never turn down</b>
<b>a potential job offer.</b>
<b>That's true.</b>
<b>After all, it's just chemistry.</b>
<b>Absolutely!</b>
<b>It's just chemistry.</b>
<b>Nobody gets it.</b>
<b>Uncle,</b>
<b>theory, practicals,</b>
<b>tests, everything will improve!</b>
<b>You can stop worrying now.</b>
<b>Darling,</b>
<b>your passion and enthusiasm</b>
<b>towards work</b>
<b>has made my eyes well up.</b>
<b>I do have passion.</b>
<b>So, have you done</b>
<b>these tests before?</b>
<b>Yes, of course!</b>
<b>Obviously, there are tests in chemistry.</b>
<b>The Lord has answered my prayers.</b>
<b>I was looking for a girl,</b>
<b>just like you.</b>
<b>Come to the plant tomorrow,</b>
<b>-Okay.</b>
<b>and get started with the work.</b>
<b>-Yes.</b>
<b>Which plant?</b>
<b>The plant...</b>
<b>which produces my product.</b>
<b>The product which needs to be tested.</b>
<b>Which test?</b>
<b>Um...</b>
<b>Remember what you told me,</b>
<b>about the tensile strength?</b>
<b>Uniform pressure.</b>
<b>It's about that.</b>
<b>It's all the same.</b>
<b>So, this isn't about</b>
<b>chemistry tutoring for your son?</b>
<b>Tutoring?</b>
<b>I was...</b>
<b>offering you a job.</b>
<b>What job?</b>
<b>-Take a look.</b>
<b>What is it?</b>
<b>Here's my ad,</b>
<b>'Looking for a condom-quality tester’.</b>
<b>Uncle,</b>
<b>respect your age, at least!</b>
<b>You should be ashamed of yourself,</b>
<b>for making such propositions!</b>
<b>Yes, initially, I did feel ashamed.</b>
<b>When my father planted</b>
<b>this idea in the plant.</b>
<b>You are incorrigible!</b>
<b>But this is noble work.</b>
<b>It's noble work.</b>
<b>-Noble work?</b>
<b>Do you want me to gather people?</b>
<b>Do you?</b>
<b>Look, you have misunderstood me.</b>
<b>You don't have to make anyone</b>
<b>try it on,</b>
<b>you just have to test it.</b>
<b>-Trying it on?</b>
<b>Uncle, now I will test</b>
<b>the tenacity of my shoe!</b>
<b>Darling, there is</b>
<b>an explosion of population</b>
<b>in all of Karnal.</b>
<b>-Let me show you.</b>
<b>Please visit the plant, just once.</b>
<b>Just once.</b>
<b>-His plant!</b>
<b>I need a person like you,</b>
<b>for the quality control.</b>
<b>It's just chemistry.</b>
<b>And there will be an increment for you</b>
<b>even before joining the company.</b>
<b>Your salary will be 25,000 rupees.</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>No? But--</b>
<b>Okay,</b>
<b>how about 30,000?</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>Let's finalize it</b>
<b>on 35,000.</b>
<b>Uncle, 'no' means, no! ??</b>
<b>Don't you understand it?</b>
<b>I will take up any job, but this!</b>
<b>Get lost!</b>
<b>Do you want me to gather people?</b>
<b>It’s a public service!</b>
<b>Think about it.</b>
<b>It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</b>
<b>"Here is my story."</b>
<b>"Narrated by yours truly."</b>
<b>"It's no fiction."</b>
<b>"My story is not an ordinary one!"</b>
<b>"But it happens in every household."</b>
<b>"The gossip sprinkles,</b>
<b>like rain showers!"</b>
<b>"The taunting never stops,</b>
<b>even on the home turf."</b>
<b>"She'll save you from them."</b>
<b>"She'll conceal it all."</b>
<b>"She'll make you laugh."</b>
<b>"She'll show you dreams."</b>
<b>"She is here,</b>
<b>to make the dreams come true!"</b>
<b>"Chhatriwali!"</b>
<b>"Chhatriwali!"</b>
<b>"Chhatriwali!"</b>
<b>"Chhatriwali!"</b>
<b>Shuffle them, once again!</b>
<b>My salary will be 50,000 rupees.</b>
<b>Um... 50?</b>
<b>Don't you think that's a lot?</b>
<b>Alright.</b>
<b>Find someone else.</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>Agreed.</b>
<b>Agreed.</b>
<b>But I have a condition.</b>
<b>Nobody should ever find out</b>
<b>that I work here.</b>
<b>Done.</b>
<b>Not a soul outside this plant</b>
<b>will know about it.</b>
<b>But I have a condition as well.</b>
<b>You will not quit this job</b>
<b>for a year, at least.</b>
<b>Get the papers ready.</b>
<b>I'll start tomorrow.</b>
<b>I like this quality</b>
<b>about the young generation.</b>
<b>Whatever might be the job,</b>
<b>they never compromise on the salary.</b>
<b>'Make a move!'</b>
<b>'Make a move!'</b>
<b>Mum!</b>
<b>How the hell did she come?</b>
<b>-Sanya is here.</b>
<b>Come on, get lost from here!</b>
<b>Don't go in there.</b>
<b>-Not there!</b>
<b>Mum!</b>
<b>-A bunch of morons!</b>
<b>Ouch!</b>
<b>God!</b>
<b>-Mum!</b>
<b>I am here.</b>
<b>-Mum!</b>
<b>Mum! Mum!</b>
<b>I might slip and fall--</b>
<b>Mum, time to ditch the broom,</b>
<b>we are getting a vacuum cleaner.</b>
<b>Huh?</b>
<b>I got a job!</b>
<b>And just guess the salary!</b>
<b>-Tell me.</b>
<b>It's 50,000 rupees!</b>
<b>Here you go!</b>
<b>My child!</b>
<b>You must</b>
<b>go down and seek the blessings.</b>
<b>Yes, of course.</b>
<b>Which company is it?</b>
<b>It's...</b>
<b>um...</b>
<b>Do you know the umbrella company</b>
<b>-Yeah.</b>
<b>which makes umbrellas?</b>
<b>That's the one.</b>
<b>I have been appointed</b>
<b>as the quality-control head.</b>
<b>The quality-control head.</b>
<b>-I see.</b>
<b>I am so glad that</b>
<b>you got a job at an umbrella company.</b>
<b>Because the older designs of umbrellas</b>
<b>just...</b>
<b>come apart!</b>
<b>And then, they begin to leak.</b>
<b>What a shame!</b>
<b>And we end up</b>
<b>getting drenched.</b>
<b>True, isn't it?</b>
<b>One more thing.</b>
<b>Make sure, there are lots of</b>
<b>designs and colours to choose from.</b>
<b>I am just fed up with the polka dots.</b>
<b>Don't worry, Mum.</b>
<b>Not just colours and dots,</b>
<b>I will make sure</b>
<b>that these umbrellas</b>
<b>have flavours as well!</b>
<b>Okay, I'll go now.</b>
<b>Auntie,</b>
<b>how do they get flavours in umbrellas?</b>
<b>Flavours?</b>
<b>Darling,</b>
<b>here's your uniform.</b>
<b>From now on, this factory,</b>
<b>its production,</b>
<b>as well as my life,</b>
<b>depends on you.</b>
<b>Please, come in.</b>
<b>Come in.</b>
<b>Here she is.</b>
<b>Darling,</b>
<b>this is our lab.</b>
<b>Now, I'm going to tell you</b>
<b>about the problems we face here.</b>
<b>For a perfectly functional condom,</b>
<b>air, water,</b>
<b>and electric testing,</b>
<b>are the most important tests.</b>
<b>When a condom passes these tests,</b>
<b>eventually, it results</b>
<b>in a happy couple!</b>
<b>It's started now.</b>
<b>This is the air test.</b>
<b>Please, twist it.</b>
<b>Keep doing it.</b>
<b>Now, press the lower part.</b>
<b>No, not with your fingers,</b>
<b>use your hand, like this.</b>
<b>Do it this way.</b>
<b>So that we can find</b>
<b>if there is any leakage.</b>
<b>I am sorry, darling.</b>
<b>Really sorry.</b>
<b>The entire problem is</b>
<b>related to the leakage.</b>
<b>Henceforth, you should manage it.</b>
<b>I also wish that</b>
<b>the quality becomes</b>
<b>absolutely watertight!</b>
<b>Sanya,</b>
<b>how was the first day?</b>
<b>Um...</b>
<b>It was nice.</b>
<b>Quite good.</b>
<b>It was nice.</b>
<b>What happened?</b>
<b>Is this how you play?</b>
<b>-Come on!</b>
<b>Mr Lamba,</b>
<b>I have to discuss</b>
<b>something important with you.</b>
<b>Darling,</b>
<b>I just got your agreement franked.</b>
<b>Now, you can't</b>
<b>quit this job before a year--</b>
<b>Put them back, Mr Lamba.</b>
<b>Just put them back.</b>
<b>The entire stock of latex</b>
<b>is degrading!</b>
<b>Really?</b>
<b>But the supplier has sent us</b>
<b>tested stock.</b>
<b>And it's well within</b>
<b>the expiration date.</b>
<b>I'm sure, that's true.</b>
<b>But here, it's stored</b>
<b>as if it's firewood!</b>
<b>Mr Lamba,</b>
<b>this is</b>
<b>a chemically sensitive substance.</b>
<b>It reacts with water as well as air.</b>
<b>And the weakening of</b>
<b>tensile and ductile strength</b>
<b>causes the oops.</b>
<b>Please, order a fresh stock.</b>
<b>Mr Lamba,</b>
<b>I'm leaving now.</b>
<b>'I have to attend</b>
<b>my friend's engagement party.'</b>
<b>Which flavour is good?</b>
<b>The pistachio flavour is nice.</b>
<b>Hello.</b>
<b>Hi.</b>
<b>I'll have the pistachio flavour.</b>
<b>Actually, I wanted to talk to</b>
<b>you about something important.</b>
<b>Do you want to apologize</b>
<b>for chewing me out on the bus?</b>
<b>It's okay.</b>
<b>Anyway, there are no gentlemen</b>
<b>left in this city.</b>
<b>May I have it?</b>
<b>You are right.</b>
<b>And the remaining ones are</b>
<b>in demand.</b>
<b>Yes, I mean,</b>
<b>everybody's getting married.</b>
<b>That's true.</b>
<b>These ladies have been</b>
<b>hounding me</b>
<b>with their questions, all evening.</b>
<b>Do you see that lady?</b>
<b>Which one?</b>
<b>The one in magenta outfit.</b>
<b>I see.</b>
<b>She has too many questions.</b>
<b>She has grilled me enough</b>
<b>to trace my family tree.</b>
<b>That's my mum.</b>
<b>Really?</b>
<b>Actually,</b>
<b>she seems to be a nice lady.</b>
<b>She is very beautiful.</b>
<b>Just like you.</b>
<b>Hey,</b>
<b>what's your name?</b>
<b>I'm Rishi.</b>
<b>Sanya.</b>
<b>Nice to meet you.</b>
<b>Same here.</b>
<b>Once again.</b>
<b>Once again.</b>
<b>Honestly,</b>
<b>the purpose of these weddings</b>
<b>and functions</b>
<b>is exactly this.</b>
<b>To be honest, I am a bit averse</b>
<b>to attend these weddings.</b>
<b>But today,</b>
<b>I'm glad to be here.</b>
<b>You are working someplace, right?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>I am working.</b>
<b>Which company?</b>
<b>Um...</b>
<b>The umbrella factory.</b>
<b>I see.</b>
<b>I work there as</b>
<b>a quality-control head.</b>
<b>That's great.</b>
<b>I am not the brightest bulb</b>
<b>when it comes to studying.</b>
<b>Thanks to 'bhaiji',</b>
<b>I own a shop, selling goods</b>
<b>required for religious ceremonies.</b>
<b>But when it comes to business,</b>
<b>I'm sharper than Sherlock Holmes.</b>
<b>Have you heard of, 'Kalra Puja Shop'?</b>
<b>That's mine.</b>
<b>I see.</b>
<b>I'll show you a magic trick.</b>
<b>Sure.</b>
<b>Although I don't have</b>

<b>Magic!</b>
<b>Kalra Puja Shop!</b>
<b>That's the one!</b>
<b>It's viral on</b>

<b>This message also has my</b>

<b>Personal.</b>
<b>You can call me...</b>
<b>if need be.</b>
<b>So,</b>

<b>Mr Lamba,</b>

<b>Actually...</b>
<b>Here is...</b>
<b>Darling,</b>
<b>are you getting married?</b>
<b>Congratulations!</b>
<b>Thank you, Mr Lamba.</b>
<b>Don't worry, darling.</b>
<b>I won't be attending your wedding.</b>
<b>Because I know that</b>
<b>if I attend your wedding,</b>
<b>it will result in a divorce</b>
<b>even before it happens.</b>
<b>Am I right?</b>
<b>Tell me something.</b>
<b>Have you told</b>
<b>your future partner</b>
<b>about your job?</b>
<b>Darling,</b>
<b>you are about to</b>
<b>begin a new chapter,</b>
<b>and a new relationship.</b>
<b>And the new beginnings</b>
<b>should begin with honesty.</b>
<b>Mr Lamba,</b>
<b>why shoot yourself in the foot?</b>
<b>Besides,</b>
<b>the nature of this job</b>
<b>is really difficult to explain.</b>
<b>That’s a devout and pious family.</b>
<b>You know,</b>
<b>in that household, there</b>
<b>are more idols of deities</b>
<b>than there are utensils!</b>
<b>And 'bhaiji' will</b>
<b>never get it.</b>
<b>Anyway,</b>
<b>it's a matter of a few months. After</b>
<b>that, there's nothing to worry about.</b>
<b>Darling,</b>
<b>the work you are doing...</b>
<b>doesn't deserve shame.</b>
<b>It's noble work.</b>
<b>This is not just a job.</b>
<b>This work saves lives.</b>
<b>My God!</b>
<b>So, this is what you do!</b>
<b>Does Rishi know?</b>
<b>What if someone finds out?</b>
<b>That's the reason, I'm confiding in you.</b>
<b>I don't know</b>
<b>how to disclose this to Rishi.</b>
<b>But for how long can you hide it?</b>
<b>Believe me, I'm really tense</b>
<b>about this secret life.</b>
<b>I don't know</b>
<b>if I'm fooling others or myself.</b>
<b>The contract will end</b>
<b>three months after the wedding.</b>
<b>I can't wait for it to get over!</b>
<b>I mean it.</b>
<b>But after confiding in you,</b>
<b>I'm feeling a lot lighter.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>But please, don't tell anyone about it.</b>
<b>Pinky promise?</b>
<b>By the way,</b>
<b>it's a matter of just three months.</b>
<b>Find an opportune moment</b>
<b>to disclose it to Rishi.</b>
<b>Now, please forget about that.</b>
<b>So that you can think about</b>
<b>your wedding.</b>

<b>Sanya Kalra.</b>
<b>Now, you are a part of this home.</b>
<b>You must also protect</b>
<b>the pride of this home.</b>
<b>Of course.</b>
<b>Baby!</b>
<b>Please, get a condom.</b>
<b>A condom?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Why?</b>
<b>What do you mean?</b>
<b>Won't we need it?</b>
<b>Baby, condoms are for lovers.</b>
<b>They need to be careful</b>
<b>because they are not married.</b>
<b>And we are already married--</b>
<b>Baby,</b>
<b>does being married mean</b>
<b>that we are no longer lovers?</b>
<b>Are we not?</b>
<b>Of course, we are.</b>
<b>So?</b>
<b>Why would I wear a raincoat</b>
<b>if I want to enjoy the rains?</b>
<b>But baby,</b>
<b>what if the rainfall</b>
<b>results in babies?</b>
<b>Then, what?</b>
<b>It will lead to drought.</b>
<b>Are you okay with that?</b>
<b>Don't worry.</b>
<b>I've done a lot of research.</b>
<b>I'll make sure to turn around</b>
<b>before the accident happens.</b>
<b>And what if you don't succeed?</b>
<b>Let me begin the journey, at least.</b>
<b>You can take a pill if I don't succeed.</b>
<b>Baby, please get it.</b>
<b>Please!</b>
<b>Trust me, I will turn around.</b>
<b>Please, don't spoil the ambiance.</b>
<b>Are you sure?</b>
<b>Trust me.</b>
<b>Are you sure?</b>
<b>Just wait and watch.</b>

<b>Again?</b>
<b>You get these aches and cramps</b>

<b>You should be doing...</b>
<b>yoga and deep breathing.</b>
<b>I'm already doing that.</b>
<b>Let me do it.</b>
<b>I'll manage--</b>

<b>But--</b>

<b>Give me the other foot.</b>
<b>No, I can do it--</b>

<b>Listen,</b>

<b>Why don't you</b>

<b>Sure.</b>
<b>You can go ahead,</b>

<b>Greetings, 'Bhaiji'!</b>
<b>Good morning!</b>
<b>-Good morning!</b>
<b>Good morning!</b>
<b>Greetings, Mum and Dad!</b>
<b>-Hello, darling.</b>
<b>Hello, darling.</b>
<b>Nisha,</b>
<b>what's that on your forehead?</b>
<b>It's nothing.</b>
<b>I just have a bit of a headache.</b>
<b>Auntie,</b>
<b>mum gets these cramps</b>
<b>too often.</b>
<b>She gets frequent headaches,</b>
<b>leg cramps,</b>
<b>and stomach aches.</b>
<b>Nisha,</b>
<b>you should try moonseed water.</b>
<b>It improves the immunity.</b>
<b>Sure.</b>
<b>Listen,</b>
<b>both of you will be home</b>
<b>for dinner, right?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>I must get going, 'Bhaiji'.</b>
<b>Hey!</b>
<b>Why are you going by yourself?</b>
<b>How will you manage alone?</b>
<b>He is about to leave for work.</b>
<b>He will drive you to work.</b>
<b>It's alright, 'Bhaiji'.</b>
<b>I can go by myself.</b>
<b>It's not a problem.</b>
<b>That way, he can see where the plant is.</b>
<b>He can bring your lunch,</b>
<b>in case you forget it.</b>
<b>Um...</b>
<b>I don't wish to bother Rishi.</b>
<b>Anyway, he is not ready,</b>
<b>and I am late. So--</b>
<b>I am almost done.</b>
<b>I'll go with you.</b>
<b>Please, don't rush yourself.</b>
<b>Sanya,</b>
<b>do you know what I think of you?</b>
<b>For me, you are a powerful role model.</b>
<b>And I can’t allow a role model</b>
<b>to use public transport, can I?</b>
<b>Certainly, not.</b>
<b>Sure, you can.</b>
<b>Come on, drop her off</b>
<b>at the company gate.</b>
<b>Sure.</b>
<b>Let's go.</b>
<b>You should go together.</b>
<b>Bye, Auntie.</b>
<b>Please, stop right ahead.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>Vehicles are not allowed inside.</b>
<b>Really?</b>
<b>-That's it.</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Okay, honey.</b>
<b>You can leave now.</b>
<b>-Here on, I can manage by myself.</b>
<b>I rode the bike for so long.</b>
<b>Let's just say our goodbyes properly.</b>
<b>You can leave now.</b>
<b>-Hey!</b>
<b>Bye.</b>
<b>I'll watch you till you go inside.</b>
<b>Aren't you getting late?</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Bye.</b>
<b>Hello.</b>
<b>Please, state your business.</b>
<b>Um...</b>
<b>Mehta...</b>
<b>I have an appointment</b>
<b>with Mr Mehta.</b>
<b>I'm Sanya.</b>
<b>Please, wait here.</b>
<b>I'm from 'Dainik Sangram'.</b>
<b>Mr Mehta has won,</b>
<b>'the best umbrella brand</b>
<b>in Karnal' award.</b>
<b>His photo will appear in the newspaper.</b>
<b>Sir, you have a visitor</b>
<b>named Sanya.</b>
<b>She claims that she has</b>
<b>an appointment with you.</b>
<b>The umbrella brand has won an award.</b>
<b>Tell him about the photo!</b>
<b>She says that a photo will be featured</b>
<b>in a newspaper.</b>
<b>A photo of Mr Mehta or the umbrella?</b>
<b>Photos of Mr Mehta, the umbrella,</b>
<b>and the factory,</b>
<b>everything will be</b>
<b>photographed and featured!</b>
<b>Will it be in colour or</b>
<b>in black-and-white?</b>
<b>You!</b>
<b>The photo will be full-size,</b>
<b>in colour,</b>
<b>on the front page,</b>
<b>along with an interview!</b>
<b>Do you want me to do it,</b>
<b>or not?</b>
<b>Just wait for a moment.</b>
<b>Yes, sir.</b>
<b>Shall I send her in?</b>
<b>Okay, you can go inside.</b>
<b>Sure.</b>
<b>Sir is here!</b>
<b>Good morning, sir.</b>
<b>-Good morning, sir.</b>
<b>Good morning.</b>
<b>Sit down.</b>
<b>Thank you, sir.</b>
<b>-Thank you, sir.</b>
<b>THE SEX CLASS IS HERE</b>
<b>TO SPREAD THE JOY</b>
<b>Who the hell did this?</b>
<b>All the boys</b>
<b>will stay here with me.</b>
<b>Girls will accompany Ms Zohra</b>
<b>to section B.</b>
<b>Get up, girls.</b>
<b>Move it!</b>
<b>Faster.</b>
<b>Just note this down.</b>
<b>The rest is not important.</b>
<b>Sir,</b>
<b>what does, 'copulation' mean?</b>
<b>It's... um...</b>
<b>When a bird sits on top of</b>
<b>another bird,</b>
<b>that's called, copulation.</b>
<b>So,</b>
<b>if I sit on top of Chandan,</b>
<b>can that be called, ‘copulation’?</b>
<b>Don't try and act smart!</b>
<b>Just learn it by rote.</b>
<b>And it doesn't matter</b>
<b>even if you don't do it.</b>
<b>Because the questions from this chapter</b>
<b>are allotted just two marks.</b>
<b>And that too will be optional.</b>
<b>But make sure that you learn</b>
<b>the digestive system thoroughly.</b>
<b>A long-answer question will be</b>
<b>allotted to the digestive system.</b>
<b>Don't forget,</b>
<b>I can play nice,</b>
<b>but pray that you don’t have to</b>
<b>see my bad side.</b>
<b>So, don't test my patience.</b>
<b>Now, write it down.</b>
<b>What's cooking?</b>
<b>Oh, wow!</b>
<b>Did mum get a break today?</b>
<b>No, it's not that.</b>
<b>Just wanted to have something special.</b>
<b>Dad!</b>
<b>Dad’s culinary skills are on par</b>
<b>with a five-star chef!</b>
<b>Yes, I can see that.</b>
<b>Rishi!</b>
<b>I said, no!</b>
<b>Looks like the volcano</b>
<b>is about to erupt, once again.</b>
<b>When he was born,</b>
<b>the nurse declared,</b>
<b>"Congratulations, Mr Kalra!</b>
<b>You've got stress!"</b>
<b>What happened, docile little brother?</b>
<b>There is a lot of empty space</b>
<b>in the shop.</b>
<b>I suggested that we could</b>
<b>sell some school supplies</b>
<b>along with</b>
<b>the puja-related goods.</b>
<b>There is a school right next door.</b>
<b>He just refused.</b>
<b>According to him, the puja shop should</b>
<b>only sell goods related to puja.</b>
<b>I've had enough of it!</b>
<b>Why don't you say something?</b>
<b>Why do you want to trouble</b>
<b>a poor pensioner?</b>
<b>I can't even get him to change</b>
<b>the channel on the TV!</b>
<b>How can I convince him</b>
<b>to expand the business?</b>
<b>Dad,</b>
<b>may I try talking to 'bhaiji'?</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>You don't have to do it.</b>
<b>Why do you want to play</b>
<b>the matador to an angry bull?</b>
<b>Dad!</b>
<b>'Bhaiji' is not an angry bull.</b>
<b>He is more like a gentle deer.</b>
<b>All one needs to know,</b>
<b>is how to set a trap!</b>
<b>If you are here to advocate Rishi,</b>
<b>then please, don't bother.</b>
<b>Of course, not.</b>
<b>I just wanted to know</b>
<b>if you are ready for dinner.</b>
<b>Yes, sure.</b>
<b>-Okay.</b>
<b>Oh! I'm so sorry,</b>
<b>'Bhaiji'! Sorry.</b>
<b>Why did you do that to those pages?</b>
<b>These are not just pages,</b>
<b>it's a medium of knowledge.</b>
<b>It can't be disrespected like this.</b>
<b>Oh, yes.</b>
<b>Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge</b>
<b>is believed to favour it.</b>
<b>Absolutely!</b>
<b>So,</b>
<b>just like the stole</b>
<b>symbolizes Goddess Durga,</b>
<b>do these pages symbolize</b>
<b>Goddess Saraswati?</b>
<b>What are you implying?</b>
<b>Nothing at all.</b>
<b>I was trying to say</b>
<b>that our belief</b>
<b>decides if it's just a statue of stone,</b>
<b>or the God.</b>
<b>Similarly,</b>
<b>these pages can be school supplies,</b>
<b>or the sacred goods,</b>
<b>based on one's belief.</b>
<b>Wow.</b>
<b>What a thought!</b>
<b>Really amazing.</b>
<b>I'll just set the table.</b>
<b>Wait.</b>
<b>Rishi,</b>
<b>Yes?</b>
<b>Make a special corner for</b>
<b>Goddess Saraswati in the shop.</b>
<b>And you can sell</b>
<b>school supplies there.</b>
<b>Is that okay?</b>
<b>Sure.</b>
<b>One more thing.</b>
<b>Make sure that you</b>
<b>count your blessings, every day!</b>
<b>You are a lucky man.</b>
<b>You are blessed with</b>
<b>such a wise partner.</b>
<b>Of course!</b>
<b>Talk about pearls being cast</b>
<b>before swine!</b>
<b>Am I right, Dad?</b>
<b>Dad?</b>
<b>Where did you come from?</b>
<b>Auntie,</b>
<b>tomorrow,</b>
<b>I have a test.</b>
<b>Will you help me prepare for it?</b>
<b>Yes, sure!</b>
<b>Biology?</b>
<b>But,</b>
<b>your father is a biology teacher.</b>
<b>Is he busy with something?</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>How can I learn this from him?</b>
<b>He is averse to this topic.</b>
<b>I thought,</b>
<b>why don’t I learn it from you?</b>
<b>Is this the one?</b>
<b>-No, not this one.</b>
<b>It's okay if you teach me</b>
<b>just the female part.</b>
<b>These two parts are</b>
<b>optional in the exam.</b>
<b>So, it's okay</b>
<b>if I don’t learn these parts.</b>
<b>Darling,</b>
<b>if it's in the textbook,</b>
<b>there must be</b>
<b>a good reason for it, right?</b>
<b>And even if learning this part</b>
<b>is optional now,</b>
<b>it will prove</b>
<b>to be useful later in life.</b>
<b>So, we will learn all of it.</b>
<b>Okay?</b>
<b>Mum!</b>
<b>What happened, Mum?</b>
<b>Please get up, Mum!</b>
<b>Please!</b>
<b>Mum!</b>
<b>Please get up, Mum--</b>
<b>-What's that--</b>
<b>Mum!</b>
<b>Auntie!</b>
<b>-Nisha!</b>
<b>What happened?</b>
<b>What happened to her?</b>
<b>Nisha!</b>
<b>-I don't know</b>
<b>what happened to her!</b>
<b>What is it?</b>
<b>-Let me call 'bhaiji'.</b>
<b>There is no need to call anybody.</b>
<b>Just take me to the hospital.</b>
<b>But Nisha--</b>
<b>Please, take me to the hospital.</b>
<b>This was the second miscarriage.</b>
<b>And there were two abortions</b>
<b>in the past.</b>
<b>You have to understand, her body</b>
<b>is extremely weak at the moment.</b>
<b>How can she carry a pregnancy</b>
<b>in this state?</b>
<b>And if she doesn't want a baby,</b>
<b>then the pregnancy</b>
<b>should be avoided, right?</b>
<b>I have explained this to her</b>
<b>many times in the past.</b>
<b>Why doesn't she use condoms?</b>
<b>The frequent use of emergency pills</b>
<b>has badly damaged her body.</b>
<b>Please,</b>
<b>talk to her.</b>
<b>She was lucky this time.</b>
<b>But the next abortion...</b>
<b>could prove to be fatal for her.</b>
<b>Can we see her?</b>
<b>-Yes.</b>
<b>'My three kids are a result</b>
<b>of unplanned pregnancies.'</b>
<b>Hence, I prefer having</b>
<b>abortions secretly,</b>
<b>over telling my</b>
<b>husband about it.</b>
<b>There was a lot of interrogation,</b>
<b>when I tried confiding in him.</b>
<b>'Why don't you take pills?'</b>
<b>'How will we manage if there is</b>
<b>one more mouth to feed?'</b>
<b>What can I do, Sanya?</b>
<b>If I take the pills,</b>
<b>there are so many side effects,</b>
<b>like headaches and stomach aches.</b>
<b>How can the body retain</b>
<b>its strength in this condition?</b>
<b>So, why don't you use condoms?</b>
<b>I tried.</b>
<b>But my husband doesn't approve it.</b>
<b>According to him, it's indecent.</b>
<b>He thinks, something that needs</b>
<b>to be concealed from everybody,</b>
<b>is not worth using.</b>
<b>And it would really embarrass him</b>
<b>if he is seen buying it.</b>
<b>A love story</b>
<b>is no longer a love story...</b>
<b>if the love has evaporated from it.</b>
<b>But don't you think--</b>
<b>Sanya.</b>
<b>Tell me,</b>
<b>have you ever tried discussing</b>
<b>this with Rishi?</b>
<b>It's the same story for every household.</b>
<b>We don't wish to</b>
<b>discuss this topic.</b>
<b>Even if it costs us our lives.</b>
<b>I just can't wait...</b>
<b>to turn 45 and hit the menopause.</b>
<b>Then, I will be free from</b>
<b>these pills and abortions.</b>
<b>Don’t say that.</b>
<b>Are you feeling better?</b>
<b>Please, don't get up.</b>
<b>What happened?</b>
<b>'Bhaiji'--</b>
<b>-It's nothing.</b>
<b>The monthly problem, that's all.</b>
<b>I am okay.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Please, take care.</b>
<b>Let me know if you need anything.</b>
<b>Take medicines on time.</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>-I'll just get freshened up.</b>
<b>Nisha, why didn't you tell him--</b>
<b>Sanya,</b>
<b>don't worry about me.</b>
<b>I'll feel better.</b>
<b>But...</b>
<b>please, don't tell anyone about it.</b>
<b>Please.</b>
<b>What happened?</b>
<b>Your mum is feeling better now, right?</b>
<b>Don't be scared.</b>
<b>But I am scared, Auntie.</b>
<b>This not the first time it happened.</b>
<b>And I'm not a kid any more.</b>
<b>I understand, what's happening here.</b>
<b>What if,</b>
<b>what if something happens to mum?</b>
<b>Nothing will happen to her.</b>
<b>That's not how things should be.</b>
<b>What will happen if things</b>
<b>continue this way?</b>
<b>Auntie,</b>
<b>we must find a permanent solution</b>
<b>to this problem.</b>
<b>Now what happened, darling?</b>
<b>Mr Lamba,</b>
<b>you were right.</b>
<b>This job is not about just chemistry,</b>
<b>it does save lives.</b>
<b>Henceforth, I pledge to work...</b>
<b>at no other place, but here!</b>
<b>Mr Lamba,</b>
<b>the latest quality report shows</b>
<b>97 percent safety.</b>
<b>Now, there will no oops, darling!</b>
<b>Stop!</b>
<b>Baby, please close your eyes.</b>
<b>My eyes?</b>
<b>Please.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>You want a surprise, right?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Baby,</b>
<b>Yes?</b>
<b>I love you, right?</b>
<b>I...</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>I love you too.</b>
<b>You will do anything for me, right?</b>
<b>With my eyes closed?</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Please, read this for me!</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>What's this?</b>
<b>Why do you want me</b>
<b>to study during the playtime?</b>
<b>Please, go through it.</b>
<b>Please, baby.</b>
<b>This is as vast as</b>
<b>the syllabus for the bar exam!</b>
<b>Once again, this useless topic--</b>
<b>Baby, this is not a useless topic.</b>
<b>Just take a look.</b>
<b>Just this once.</b>
<b>Just read about the side effects</b>
<b>of emergency pills.</b>
<b>But it doesn't make</b>
<b>any difference to men.</b>
<b>You know,</b>
<b>I've read</b>
<b>that 95 percent men</b>
<b>are repelled by condoms,</b>
<b>like oil is repelled by water!</b>
<b>Hey!</b>
<b>Look, that's not entirely true.</b>
<b>It does make a difference to men.</b>
<b>This thing has its own set of problems.</b>
<b>I have heard that it can</b>
<b>lead to a system shutdown down there.</b>
<b>But--</b>
<b>And to buy a rubber at a shop,</b>
<b>in front of everybody--</b>
<b>Please, don't use that term.</b>
<b>Just say, condom.</b>
<b>Condom.</b>
<b>This is truly shocking.</b>
<b>Ms Kalpana Chawla managed to</b>
<b>conquer the space.</b>
<b>She was from Karnal, just like you.</b>
<b>And you can't even conquer</b>
<b>your fear, and go to a medical store!</b>
<b>Baby--</b>
<b>Hey, but...</b>
<b>That's why they say,</b>
<b>'Use it,</b>
<b>before you choose it.'</b>
<b>Have you lost it?</b>
<b>Where did you get this...</b>
<b>Hey!</b>
<b>You!</b>
<b>Everybody's home.</b>
<b>'Bhaiji'--</b>
<b>Is he going to come in here?</b>
<b>Is he?</b>
<b>Of course, not.</b>
<b>But if anyone finds it,</b>
<b>what will they think?</b>
<b>Did you get this</b>
<b>from the market?</b>
<b>Everyone knows me there.</b>
<b>Don't flatter yourself.</b>
<b>I didn't buy this</b>
<b>at the market. I...</b>
<b>I...</b>
<b>I got it from the shop</b>
<b>at the highway.</b>
<b>So, relax.</b>
<b>-Sure.</b>
<b>And Baby,</b>
<b>I have made a decision.</b>
<b>Either you will use a condom,</b>
<b>or let me use it.</b>
<b>Otherwise, you can resort to self-help.</b>
<b>Hey!</b>
<b>Hey, but--</b>
<b>One more thing.</b>
<b>If you want me,</b>
<b>you must accept the condom.</b>
<b>That's absurd.</b>
<b>MADAN MEDICAL SHOP</b>
<b>Rishi?</b>
<b>What do you need?</b>
<b>Um...</b>
<b>I need a toothpaste.</b>
<b>A toothpaste.</b>
<b>Anything else?</b>
<b>There are too many mosquitos, right?</b>
<b>I'll take a mosquito repellent as well.</b>
<b>A mosquito repellent.</b>
<b>Anything else?</b>
<b>I'll take one of these rubbers.</b>
<b>Because people like you use them,</b>
<b>such obscene products</b>
<b>are manufactured!</b>
<b>And I am forced to sell them.</b>
<b>Mr Madan, I don't care if it's obscene!</b>
<b>Without a condom, I'm an outlaw</b>
<b>in my own bedroom!</b>
<b>Just give it.</b>
<b>Which flavour?</b>
<b>Thank you, honey.</b>
<b>For accepting my request.</b>
<b>Let me read the instructions,</b>
<b>I don't want to mess it up.</b>
<b>That's easy.</b>
<b>Just place it, and then roll it.</b>
<b>Really?</b>
<b>You seem to know a lot about it.</b>
<b>Um...</b>
<b>I...</b>
<b>Remember the red folder</b>
<b>that I gave you?</b>
<b>It has the literature</b>
<b>explaining everything.</b>
<b>But you didn't even bother</b>
<b>to read it.</b>
<b>Wow.</b>
<b>Someone seems to be</b>
<b>in the seventh heaven!</b>
<b>The carriage horse</b>
<b>has transformed into a racehorse!</b>
<b>It's an amazing thing.</b>
<b>It is, isn't it?</b>
<b>You bet!</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>Nisha,</b>
<b>-Yes?</b>
<b>I wanted to discuss</b>
<b>something important with you.</b>
<b>Tell me.</b>
<b>Now, Rishi is using the condoms.</b>
<b>I think, you should discuss it</b>
<b>with 'bhaiji'.</b>
<b>You have lost it.</b>
<b>Why are you saying that?</b>
<b>Rishi is like water,</b>
<b>takes the shape of the container.</b>
<b>And his brother</b>
<b>is like an acid.</b>
<b>You get it, right?</b>
<b>Do you wish for</b>
<b>troubles in my marriage?</b>
<b>That won't happen!</b>
<b>All of us will ensure that.</b>
<b>Just let go of it, Sanya.</b>
<b>How can I let go of it?</b>
<b>I have survived it before.</b>
<b>Does that mean, you must</b>
<b>suffer for the rest of your life?</b>
<b>Fine.</b>
<b>The day it becomes a norm in Karnal,</b>
<b>I will discuss it with 'bhaiji'.</b>
<b>Okay?</b>
<b>Today, we are going to show you</b>
<b>something amazing.</b>
<b>Jaya, the genius,</b>
<b>are you ready?</b>
<b>You bet!</b>
<b>When the nocturnal passions overflow,</b>
<b>it's followed by</b>
<b>the morning-after pill.</b>
<b>It's not a just a pill,</b>
<b>it's a nightmare for your body!</b>
<b>May I?</b>
<b>-Yes.</b>
<b>Compared to the body,</b>
<b>it's just a teeny-weeny tablet.</b>
<b>So harmless, right?</b>
<b>And if you don't take it,</b>
<b>then be prepared to be blessed</b>
<b>with a bundle of joy.</b>
<b>So ladies, if you want to</b>
<b>protect your health,</b>
<b>ditch the pill,</b>
<b>and go for a condom.</b>
<b>And explain it</b>
<b>to your better halves as well.</b>
<b>What if he doesn't agree?</b>
<b>Oh, Meenu!</b>
<b>And my dear ladies,</b>
<b>equality in the world is</b>
<b>a distant dream, at the moment.</b>
<b>But we can take a small step</b>
<b>in our bedrooms, right?</b>
<b>Can't we?</b>
<b>Yes, we can!</b>
<b>-Yes, we can!</b>
<b>If he is a weary traveller,</b>
<b>consider yourself to be</b>
<b>an endless, flowing river.</b>
<b>The river can revitalize the traveller.</b>
<b>But,</b>
<b>the traveller must follow</b>
<b>the path of the river.</b>
<b>What if none of this works?</b>
<b>In that case,</b>
<b>here's the magic spell!</b>
<b>'If you want me,</b>
<b>you must accept the condom.'</b>
<b>'If you want me,</b>
<b>you must accept the condom.'</b>
<b>'If you want me,</b>

<b>Our wives are being adamant.</b>
<b>If we wish to be with them,</b>

<b>Just quit it!</b>

<b>I am fed up with these people!</b>

<b>Well done.</b>
<b>Well done.</b>
<b>Listen to me.</b>
<b>The men of Karnal</b>
<b>did not start this battle.</b>
<b>But we will,</b>
<b>bloody hell,</b>
<b>finish it!</b>
<b>Yes, sir!</b>
<b>-Yes, sir!</b>
<b>Where were you?</b>
<b>When you don't get</b>
<b>what you want at home,</b>
<b>you are forced to try outside, right?</b>
<b>This pill-fiasco has broken</b>
<b>the hearts of our husbands!</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>-They are seeking solace outside!</b>
<b>It's just smoke without fire!</b>
<b>Fire or no fire,</b>
<b>we don't wish to risk it!</b>
<b>Who's with me?</b>
<b>That's right.</b>
<b>-We don't want to risk it.</b>
<b>Meenu, you should</b>
<b>understand it, at least.</b>
<b>Tell me,</b>
<b>have you witnessed</b>
<b>your husband being unfaithful to you?</b>
<b>Have you?</b>
<b>I haven't witnessed it,</b>
<b>but I've got a whiff of it, alright!</b>
<b>Listen,</b>
<b>you can experiment all you want,</b>
<b>in your own bedroom.</b>
<b>Don't try and ruin our relationships.</b>
<b>Absolutely, right!</b>
<b>-She is right!</b>
<b>Just hear me out--</b>
<b>-Henceforth, we will make sure</b>
<b>that our husbands get</b>
<b>what they want,</b>
<b>and how they want it.</b>
<b>Let's get out of here.</b>
<b>-Let's go.</b>
<b>But...</b>
<b>Don't worry.</b>
<b>We will find a way.</b>
<b>Throughout their lives,</b>
<b>these poor women have been conditioned</b>
<b>to comply with</b>
<b>the wishes of their husbands.</b>
<b>It's a long way</b>
<b>before there is any equality.</b>
<b>I don't know what to do, Jaya.</b>
<b>But firstly,</b>
<b>I must confess everything to Rishi.</b>
<b>It's getting difficult to manage it.</b>
<b>And now,</b>
<b>Rishi has been using the condoms.</b>
<b>I'm sure, I can succeed in</b>
<b>explaining my situation to him.</b>
<b>'Rishi, I want to tell you that...'</b>
<b>'Rishi, I want to tell you that...'</b>
<b>Rishi--</b>
<b>-I missed you so much!</b>
<b>Rishi--</b>
<b>-These two days felt like two years.</b>
<b>Baby--</b>
<b>-I passed your home twice,</b>
<b>Baby, listen to me--</b>
<b>and was wondering</b>
<b>if I should go inside.</b>
<b>Baby, listen to me--</b>
<b>-I too have a lot to tell you--</b>
<b>Baby, please!</b>
<b>Baby, I need to discuss</b>
<b>something important with you--</b>
<b>'Mr Kalra!'</b>
<b>'Come out, Mr Kalra!'</b>
<b>'Mr Kalra!'</b>
<b>-'Come out!'</b>
<b>'Mr Kalra!'</b>
<b>-'Come out!'</b>
<b>Mr Kalra!</b>
<b>Please, come out!</b>
<b>Mr Madan?</b>
<b>What's this?</b>
<b>What happened?</b>
<b>You should be answering</b>
<b>that question.</b>
<b>You...</b>
<b>Why don't you come inside?</b>
<b>We can discuss it, peacefully.</b>
<b>I'm not going to set foot</b>
<b>in your home!</b>
<b>What's the matter?</b>
<b>Please, tell me.</b>
<b>Your question is truly surprising.</b>
<b>Because you have turned this city</b>
<b>into a red-light district.</b>
<b>What do you mean?</b>
<b>I mean...</b>
<b>I mean,</b>
<b>look at this.</b>
<b>KARNAL GETS ITS FIRST EVER</b>
<b>FEMALE CONDOM-TESTING OFFICER</b>
<b>I don't know for how long</b>
<b>she is into this business.</b>
<b>I started wondering,</b>
<b>why this city is plagued</b>
<b>with so much obscenity, lately!</b>
<b>Somebody is trying to malign my family.</b>
<b>There seems to be</b>
<b>some misunderstanding.</b>
<b>Sanya works at an umbrella factory.</b>
<b>Is that so?</b>
<b>-Tell them, Sanya.</b>
<b>An umbrella!</b>
<b>Come on, tell them.</b>
<b>You work for Mehta Umbrellas, right?</b>
<b>Tell them.</b>
<b>-That's right.</b>
<b>She works for Mehta Umbrellas...</b>
<b>um...</b>
<b>'Bhaiji', I--</b>
<b>-Quiet.</b>
<b>That's enough.</b>
<b>'Bhaiji',</b>
<b>you are a biology teacher, right?</b>
<b>But she has been</b>
<b>giving practical lessons!</b>
<b>She has been brainwashing our wives!</b>
<b>She is the reason behind</b>
<b>our marital problems!</b>
<b>Absolutely!</b>
<b>-He is right!</b>
<b>Mr Kalra,</b>
<b>our acquaintance goes way back.</b>
<b>Your family is known to be cultured.</b>
<b>Your family has been</b>
<b>dealing in puja-related goods!</b>
<b>We are spammed with</b>
<b>promotional messages of your shop,</b>
<b>containing images of deities!</b>
<b>And look at the scandal</b>
<b>happening in your home!</b>
<b>This, really?</b>
<b>Your family has always</b>
<b>been exemplary for us.</b>
<b>It breaks my heart to see</b>
<b>your family reputation being slandered.</b>
<b>I apologize to you</b>
<b>on behalf of Sanya.</b>
<b>I assure you,</b>
<b>it won't happen again.</b>
<b>An assurance.</b>
<b>An umbrella factory, it seems.</b>
<b>Let's go.</b>
<b>Let's go.</b>
<b>-Let's get out of here.</b>
<b>'Bhaiji'...</b>
<b>I...</b>
<b>Except Rishi and Sanya,</b>
<b>everyone else will go inside.</b>
<b>But, Son--</b>
<b>Dad, I'm taking care of it, right?</b>
<b>Nisha,</b>
<b>please, take everyone inside.</b>
<b>Rishi...</b>
<b>'I held you in high regard.'</b>
<b>I took pride in your work,</b>
<b>and loved telling everyone</b>
<b>that you are a quality-control head</b>
<b>in an MNC.</b>
<b>I believed that you are doing</b>
<b>a respectable job.</b>
<b>Is this what you are doing?</b>
<b>Have you ever thought,</b>
<b>how your actions will affect Mini?</b>
<b>'Bhaiji', it's not what you think.</b>
<b>I haven't done anything wrong.</b>
<b>Besides,</b>
<b>my work doesn't involve</b>
<b>any human contact.</b>
<b>I really am a quality-control head.</b>
<b>It's just that...</b>
<b>Rishi,</b>
<b>you have been using condoms, right?</b>
<b>Please, say something.</b>
<b>For how long have you been</b>
<b>doing this job?</b>
<b>It began before we got married.</b>
<b>So, you were doing this job,</b>
<b>when we first met.</b>
<b>Since that day,</b>
<b>you have been lying to me,</b>
<b>every single day!</b>
<b>Like a fool, I have been</b>
<b>dropping you off</b>
<b>at the gate of that factory.</b>
<b>I made sure that I waited there,</b>
<b>till you went inside.</b>
<b>I believed that was</b>
<b>an umbrella factory.</b>
<b>And all of it was a big, fat lie!</b>
<b>You have deceived me, Sanya.</b>
<b>-Rishi...</b>
<b>Me, as well as my family!</b>
<b>I thought,</b>
<b>we bring out the best in each other.</b>
<b>But you have destroyed everything!</b>
<b>You have been lying to my face!</b>
<b>Rishi!</b>
<b>Rishi, please.</b>
<b>I'm really sorry, Rishi.</b>
<b>But I couldn't have</b>
<b>told you the truth, then.</b>
<b>Please, believe me.</b>
<b>Today, I was about to tell you--</b>
<b>Rishi!</b>
<b>Rishi, please.</b>
<b>'Bhaiji', I am not doing</b>
<b>anything illegal or criminal.</b>
<b>The work I do,</b>
<b>is extremely necessary!</b>
<b>It saves lives.</b>
<b>It's noble work.</b>
<b>Sanya,</b>
<b>every household has</b>
<b>a few limits and boundaries.</b>
<b>And you have crossed that limit.</b>
<b>If you wish to continue living</b>
<b>under my roof,</b>
<b>then you will have to quit</b>
<b>that obscene job.</b>
<b>My work is not obscene!</b>
<b>But you--</b>
<b>Rishi,</b>
<b>visit her factory tomorrow,</b>
<b>and hand over her</b>
<b>resignation letter.</b>
<b>I'll have a word with</b>
<b>the school management.</b>
<b>She is an educated girl,</b>
<b>she can work as a teacher</b>
<b>at the school.</b>
<b>Is that okay?</b>
<b>It's decided, then.</b>
<b>Listen, I'm sure that it</b>
<b>will be forgotten in no time.</b>
<b>Make a few gift hampers</b>
<b>of puja-related goods,</b>
<b>to be distributed</b>
<b>among our neighbours.</b>
<b>Let's host an event</b>
<b>of devotional music,</b>
<b>and make sure that</b>
<b>everyone is invited.</b>
<b>Everything will be fine, okay?</b>
<b>Sanya!</b>
<b>'Bhaiji',</b>
<b>there is nothing wrong</b>
<b>with my work.</b>
<b>The fault lies with your point of view.</b>
<b>I--</b>
<b>-Rishi.</b>
<b>Let her go.</b>
<b>She needs some time to cool off.</b>
<b>"Last night,</b>
<b>my heart wept a lot."</b>
<b>There was no respite,</b>
<b>even for a moment!"</b>
<b>"You have hurt it."</b>
<b>"My heart is broken."</b>
<b>"You have hurt it."</b>
<b>"My heart is broken."</b>
<b>"I tried explaining it."</b>
<b>"That it's better</b>
<b>if some memories aren't cherished."</b>
<b>"I'm feeling stifled."</b>
<b>"My heart is broken."</b>
<b>"You have hurt it."</b>
<b>"My heart is broken."</b>
<b>"I called your name,</b>
<b>many times."</b>
<b>"But my voice was drowned out</b>
<b>by the cacophony."</b>
<b>"Many love stories bloomed."</b>
<b>"But my story could not blossom."</b>
<b>"Nobody should face</b>
<b>a predicament like this!"</b>
<b>"The way you abandoned me."</b>
<b>"My home is forsaken."</b>
<b>"My heart is broken."</b>
<b>"You have hurt it."</b>
<b>"My heart is broken."</b>
<b>This is serious!</b>
<b>How could you not tell me about it?</b>
<b>Why?</b>
<b>You took up that job,</b>
<b>and now, it's all water</b>
<b>under the bridge.</b>
<b>However,</b>
<b>that job...</b>
<b>must not wreck your marriage.</b>
<b>Mum,</b>
<b>you always prayed for a miracle, right?</b>
<b>Consider that a miracle appeared</b>
<b>in the form of my job.</b>
<b>The education fees for Jaya and Nikky,</b>
<b>as well as,</b>
<b>the repair work for the leaking roof,</b>
<b>the motor scooter,</b>
<b>and the solution to all our problems,</b>
<b>was possible because of this job.</b>
<b>Mum,</b>
<b>I am not quitting this job,</b>
<b>under any circumstances.</b>
<b>And...</b>
<b>they won't let me do it,</b>
<b>while living under their roof.</b>
<b>So, I have made up my mind.</b>
<b>But--</b>
<b>LET THE EVIL EYE BE WARDED OFF</b>
<b>Is this the backyard door?</b>
<b>Not sure.</b>
<b>Let's find out.</b>
<b>I...</b>
<b>I am,</b>
<b>Ratan Lamba.</b>
<b>I am...</b>
<b>Mrs Dhingra.</b>
<b>How can I help you?</b>
<b>Um...</b>
<b>Does Sanya live here?</b>
<b>Darling,</b>
<b>honestly,</b>
<b>I had no inkling about it.</b>
<b>Sattu was jealous of you.</b>
<b>That moron was bribed to leak</b>
<b>your story to a newspaper.</b>
<b>Sanya,</b>
<b>for the past four years,</b>
<b>I have been working in this factory.</b>
<b>All along, I was doing</b>
<b>such a crucial work,</b>
<b>but I always depreciated it.</b>
<b>You made me realize something important.</b>
<b>I wish, I was told about it</b>
<b>as an adolescent,</b>
<b>that a condom</b>
<b>is the real lifesaver.</b>
<b>That information would have</b>
<b>saved my wife from hospitalisation.</b>
<b>Mr Lamba,</b>
<b>Monu is absolutely right.</b>
<b>The problem is not Nisha's silence,</b>
<b>or the shame 'bhaiji'</b>
<b>feels about this subject.</b>
<b>Nobody cared to explain things</b>
<b>to them in their adolescence.</b>
<b>How can they have</b>
<b>the awareness, all of a sudden?</b>
<b>That's the reason you could not find</b>
<b>a quality-control officer.</b>
<b>Initially, I too had</b>
<b>turned down the job.</b>
<b>That's the reason I could not convince</b>
<b>Nisha and the other ladies.</b>
<b>All the while,</b>
<b>I was pruning the foliage.</b>
<b>But the problem is at the roots.</b>
<b>So, I must begin working</b>
<b>at the root level.</b>
<b>What does that mean?</b>
<b>What do you have in mind?</b>
<b>I mean,</b>
<b>nothing too drastic.</b>
<b>But I will make sure that</b>
<b>Mini learns biology from her father.</b>
<b>I like this quality about</b>
<b>the young generation.</b>
<b>They are extremely brave.</b>
<b>'Sir,'</b>
<b>'I just have one point.'</b>
<b>The chapter about</b>
<b>reproduction and safe sex</b>
<b>is mandatory</b>
<b>in the school curriculum.</b>
<b>So, why does it have</b>
<b>an optional status in exams?</b>
<b>You know that it's an important thing.</b>
<b>At the very least,</b>
<b>this chapter should be allotted</b>
<b>a long-answer question.</b>
<b>Sir,</b>
<b>this measure is necessary.</b>
<b>It will ensure that the teachers</b>
<b>explain this chapter in detail,</b>
<b>and the students learn it, thoroughly.</b>
<b>I am well aware of</b>
<b>your exploits!</b>
<b>But Karnal is not famous</b>
<b>for your actions.</b>
<b>It is famous because of</b>
<b>Ms Kalpana Chawla.</b>
<b>This city is known for</b>
<b>the knockout wrestlers it produced.</b>
<b>In the last 25 years,</b>
<b>this institute has produced</b>
<b>nine wrestlers competing</b>
<b>at the national level.</b>
<b>But you...</b>
<b>Couldn't you find</b>
<b>any other profession?</b>
<b>You chose to be a condom tester!</b>
<b>I wish to know something else.</b>
<b>In the last 25 years,</b>
<b>how many girl students</b>
<b>from this institute,</b>
<b>have undergone abortions?</b>
<b>I hope you know,</b>
<b>what an abortion means.</b>
<b>It means, 'a deliberate termination</b>
<b>of human pregnancy'.</b>
<b>The answer is, more than 300 girls.</b>
<b>Out of them, 54 girls miscarried,</b>
<b>and 12 girls could not survive.</b>
<b>What do these numbers--</b>
<b>-Look!</b>
<b>Why fix something,</b>
<b>that's not even broken?</b>
<b>You may leave now.</b>
<b>Please, leave.</b>
<b>Check it out!</b>
<b>Your support has boosted my morale.</b>
<b>KARNAL PLAYGROUND</b>
<b>Ma'am,</b>
<b>Ma'am,</b>
<b>I had a few questions for you.</b>
<b>Tell me.</b>
<b>Um...</b>
<b>I mean, you won't tell</b>
<b>anyone about it, right?</b>
<b>No, I won't.</b>
<b>Ma'am,</b>
<b>last week, I had gone out</b>
<b>with a friend,</b>
<b>to watch a new film.</b>
<b>So,</b>
<b>we had some snacks.</b>
<b>Ma'am,</b>
<b>I mean...</b>
<b>We kissed as well.</b>
<b>So, my question was,</b>
<b>I mean...</b>
<b>like...</b>
<b>When two people share a kiss,</b>
<b>can it result in a pregnancy?</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>Monty, you can ask</b>
<b>as many questions,</b>
<b>without hesitation or fear.</b>
<b>Got it?</b>
<b>And tell all your friends</b>
<b>that I'll be glad to answer</b>
<b>all the questions about this topic.</b>
<b>All kinds of questions?</b>
<b>You bet.</b>
<b>And nothing discussed here</b>
<b>will leave this kiosk.</b>
<b>Thank you, ma'am.</b>
<b>-Okay?</b>
<b>Bye.</b>
<b>Bye, ma'am.</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>Let's go back.</b>
<b>-But why?</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>-Come on.</b>
<b>Hey!</b>
<b>-Hello!</b>
<b>Don't worry!</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>-Let's go back.</b>
<b>Come on, guys!</b>
<b>Come on!</b>
<b>Just come!</b>
<b>Go ahead.</b>
<b>Ask her!</b>
<b>Ma'am,</b>
<b>Ma'am, what is the function</b>
<b>of the ovary?</b>
<b>Ma'am, what is the function</b>
<b>of the uterus?</b>
<b>Ma'am, what is the function</b>
<b>of the testicles?</b>
<b>When does the hymen break?</b>
<b>Ma'am,</b>
<b>what's a vagina?</b>
<b>You can laugh about it.</b>
<b>That too is necessary.</b>
<b>But it's more important</b>
<b>to have information.</b>
<b>Vagina is as important</b>
<b>as any other part of your body,</b>
<b>or another organ.</b>
<b>And it is as important</b>
<b>to understand the function of that--</b>
<b>What the hell is happening here?</b>
<b>Get out of here!</b>
<b>Just scram!</b>
<b>Let's go.</b>
<b>-Come on.</b>
<b>Why are you being so stubborn?</b>
<b>These things are too inappropriate</b>
<b>to be explained to adolescents!</b>
<b>The right to drive,</b>
<b>the right to vote,</b>
<b>and the right to marry</b>
<b>is granted only at 18 years of age.</b>
<b>And the legal age for drinking is 25!</b>
<b>What could be the reason?</b>
<b>Because children lack the restraint,</b>
<b>and the sensibility required</b>
<b>to make these decisions.</b>
<b>And you are explaining,</b>
<b>'how to make babies', to these kids!</b>
<b>Why don't you file</b>
<b>a petition about this?</b>
<b>Let these kids cast their votes at 15.</b>
<b>Let them drive the cars.</b>
<b>But then, accidents will be inevitable.</b>
<b>You are right, 'Bhaiji'.</b>
<b>Absolutely, right.</b>
<b>These children</b>
<b>don't have the sensibility,</b>
<b>or the restraint.</b>
<b>But tell me something.</b>
<b>The bodily changes begin to happen</b>
<b>at ages 12 to 13, right?</b>
<b>Can you stop that?</b>
<b>No, right?</b>
<b>It's obvious</b>
<b>that the children will be</b>
<b>curious about those changes.</b>
<b>That curiosity will lead them</b>
<b>to be hasty,</b>
<b>and to try doing things</b>
<b>by themselves.</b>
<b>And that's the reason</b>
<b>it is more important</b>
<b>that they have the required</b>
<b>information, at this age.</b>
<b>They will make grave mistakes</b>
<b>if they remain ignorant.</b>
<b>And having the right information</b>
<b>at this age,</b>
<b>will save them from</b>
<b>harbouring wrong notions,</b>
<b>as well as committing mistakes.</b>
<b>It's the need of the hour.</b>
<b>So, I am going to</b>
<b>continue with this class.</b>
<b>Rishi,</b>
<b>you are missing Sanya, right?</b>
<b>Hey!</b>
<b>You should be flaunting it,</b>
<b>not hide it!</b>
<b>You are missing her, right?</b>
<b>She lied to me.</b>
<b>To all of us.</b>
<b>Lies weaken the relationships,</b>
<b>not strengthen them.</b>
<b>Do you remember</b>
<b>when you were a kid,</b>
<b>the factory I worked in</b>
<b>had closed down.</b>
<b>After that, I drove a truck for a year.</b>
<b>Dad, are you comparing driving a truck,</b>
<b>to the job Sanya is doing?</b>
<b>That's some job!</b>
<b>What if I tell you,</b>
<b>I didn't drive a truck,</b>
<b>but worked as a butcher?</b>
<b>How would you feel?</b>
<b>My work involved slaughtering goats,</b>
<b>every single day.</b>
<b>Do you think our family</b>
<b>could have digested this piece of news?</b>
<b>No, right?</b>
<b>Our family is an ordinary,</b>
<b>religious family.</b>
<b>Son,</b>
<b>it's not necessary that</b>
<b>the truth is always right,</b>
<b>and a lie is always wrong.</b>
<b>The intent behind</b>
<b>any truth or a lie decides,</b>
<b>whether it is right,</b>
<b>or wrong.</b>
<b>That time,</b>
<b>I chose to lie.</b>
<b>For you.</b>
<b>And for our family.</b>
<b>Hey!</b>
<b>Aren't you a businessman?</b>
<b>Try reassessing the situation, then.</b>
<b>Amidst this biting cold,</b>
<b>when the entire city</b>
<b>is sleeping peacefully,</b>
<b>she is fighting this battle</b>
<b>all alone.</b>
<b>And despite all the humiliation,</b>
<b>she is unfazed.</b>
<b>Don't you agree that her point</b>
<b>is worth considering, at least?</b>
<b>My friend,</b>
<b>I am left with very little life to live,</b>
<b>but you have your entire life</b>
<b>ahead of you.</b>
<b>I think, you are wise enough</b>
<b>to figure out the rest.</b>
<b>The eggs are formed in the ovaries.</b>
<b>Okay? And the eggs</b>
<b>mature in the ovaries and...</b>
<b>She is the one!</b>
<b>The drama queen!</b>
<b>-Hey!</b>
<b>Let's go.</b>
<b>-Come on, out.</b>
<b>What happened, sir?</b>
<b>-Out!</b>
<b>What happened, sir?</b>
<b>-Let's go!</b>
<b>Take her.</b>
<b>Where am I being taken?</b>
<b>-Let's go!</b>
<b>Hurry up!</b>
<b>-Why am I being arrested, sir?</b>
<b>Come on!</b>
<b>-Please, tell me.</b>
<b>Be quiet and get inside the vehicle.</b>
<b>Sir, there seems to be</b>
<b>a misunderstanding.</b>
<b>Just get in.</b>
<b>-I'll inform the media!</b>
<b>Hey!</b>
<b>-I'm telling you!</b>
<b>Parents censor even</b>
<b>the television content for their kids!</b>
<b>And you are showing them</b>
<b>obscene pictures!</b>
<b>There is nothing obscene here.</b>
<b>Please, hear me out--</b>
<b>-Get inside.</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>-There's a misunderstanding!</b>
<b>Just hear me out once, sir.</b>
<b>-We know our job.</b>
<b>Come on!</b>
<b>-Sit down.</b>
<b>Please, don't push me.</b>
<b>Let's go.</b>
<b>-Hey, quiet!</b>
<b>Just hear me out once, please.</b>
<b>Sir, please.</b>
<b>Rishi,</b>
<b>what are you doing?</b>
<b>Where are you going?</b>
<b>I am going to bail Sanya out of jail.</b>
<b>She has left you,</b>
<b>after a slap in your face.</b>
<b>She humiliated our family</b>
<b>in front of everybody.</b>
<b>And here you are!</b>
<b>Bailing her out, with our money!</b>
<b>She left our home.</b>
<b>She didn't leave, 'Bhaiji'.</b>
<b>We threw her out of the home.</b>
<b>We humiliated her.</b>
<b>You got her arrested</b>
<b>for tutoring a couple of kids!</b>
<b>Rishi,</b>
<b>you reap, what you sow.</b>
<b>And you are following</b>
<b>her footsteps.</b>
<b>I'm doing this for your own good.</b>
<b>Rishi, listen to me.</b>
<b>Don't ever forget</b>
<b>that you have this money,</b>
<b>as well as the shop,</b>
<b>because of me.</b>
<b>You are absolutely right.</b>
<b>You have done a lot for me.</b>
<b>And I am grateful for that.</b>
<b>But I can't abandon my wife</b>
<b>to rot in jail!</b>
<b>I am going to bail Sanya out of jail.</b>
<b>As for the shop,</b>
<b>here you go.</b>
<b>You can have it.</b>
<b>Are you giving up the shop?</b>
<b>What will you do for a living?</b>
<b>You are a high-school dropout!</b>
<b>And nobody will hire</b>
<b>a high-school dropout!</b>
<b>I'll manage it, 'Bhaiji'.</b>
<b>I'll survive, somehow.</b>
<b>It's true that</b>
<b>I'm a high-school dropout.</b>
<b>But you are the illiterate one!</b>
<b>Are you here to file</b>
<b>another complain for lying to you?</b>
<b>I'm sorry.</b>
<b>I'm here to apologize.</b>
<b>I didn't stop you, when you left.</b>
<b>I let you go.</b>
<b>I didn't support you.</b>
<b>Please, forgive me.</b>
<b>I finished reading the literature</b>
<b>from the red folder you gave me.</b>
<b>Now, I have come to</b>
<b>understand everything.</b>
<b>Really?</b>
<b>What is it?</b>
<b>I have understood that</b>
<b>when things were going well,</b>
<b>I loved you a lot.</b>
<b>But now, I realize</b>
<b>that one needs more love and support,</b>
<b>when things aren't going well.</b>
<b>Think again.</b>
<b>Aren't you, 'the king of devotion'?</b>
<b>I don't--</b>
<b>I don't wish to be the reason,</b>
<b>for you to get expelled from</b>
<b>the family-WhatsApp groups.</b>
<b>It's no longer the king of devotion.</b>
<b>Now I prefer, 'the king of lust'.</b>
<b>Remember, what I said?</b>
<b>We bring out the best in each other.</b>
<b>So, our union would be</b>
<b>nothing less than a blast.</b>
<b>"My prayers have been answered."</b>
<b>"The colossal gaps have been mended."</b>
<b>"My life had lost</b>
<b>its colour without you."</b>
<b>"It's rosy, once again."</b>
<b>"The time belongs to us."</b>
<b>"The cherished memories are back."</b>
<b>"Every road and every turn,"</b>
<b>"crossed paths with you."</b>
<b>"My heart is transformed!"</b>
<b>'Urinary bladder,</b>
<b>prostate gland,</b>
<b>rectum,</b>
<b>'and penis.'</b>
<b>'And it's pronounced, 'pee-nus',</b>
<b>and not, 'pe-nis'.'</b>
<b>'Okay?'</b>
<b>'And the female</b>
<b>reproductive organs are,</b>
<b>left and right ovaries.'</b>
<b>'And as I explained,'</b>
<b>'the uterine lining</b>
<b>disintegrates,'</b>
<b>'when the egg is not fertilized.'</b>
<b>And that's followed by</b>
<b>bleeding through the vagina,</b>
<b>every month.</b>
<b>The bleeding happens</b>
<b>through which part of the body?</b>
<b>Through the vagina.</b>
<b>-Through the vagina.</b>
<b>That's right.</b>
<b>Rishi.</b>
<b>What the hell is happening here?</b>
<b>'Bhaiji', good to have you here.</b>
<b>The children have a lot of</b>
<b>doubts related to biology.</b>
<b>Who can explain things to them,</b>
<b>better than you?</b>
<b>Your teacher is here.</b>
<b>You can ask him about your queries.</b>
<b>How many times do I have to</b>
<b>say it, for you to understand?</b>
<b>She is incorrigible!</b>
<b>And you are advocating her!</b>
<b>And students,</b>
<b>do you wish to get barred</b>
<b>from exams this year?</b>
<b>Get up, right now,</b>
<b>and get back to school!</b>
<b>Otherwise, I'll make sure your grades</b>
<b>bear the cost of this.</b>
<b>Son, all of them will leave.</b>
<b>But explain something to me.</b>
<b>What is,</b>
<b>'copulation'?</b>
<b>I too have a question.</b>
<b>What does, 'STI' stand for?</b>
<b>Sir,</b>
<b>how does one protect</b>
<b>oneself from AIDS?</b>
<b>Sir,</b>
<b>what are the side effects</b>
<b>of morning pills?</b>
<b>Sir,</b>
<b>which are the safe days</b>
<b>of the month,</b>
<b>to avoid a pregnancy?</b>
<b>Just stop talking!</b>
<b>Has everyone lost it?</b>
<b>Mum and Dad,</b>
<b>how could you get deceived by her?</b>
<b>Do you realize,</b>
<b>how all of this will affect my daughter?</b>
<b>Do you?</b>
<b>Nisha,</b>
<b>just take Mini inside with you.</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>Not today.</b>
<b>I won't budge from here,</b>
<b>till you answer my question.</b>
<b>The human body...</b>
<b>is capable of enduring,</b>
<b>how many abortions, exactly?</b>
<b>I have suffered two abortions,</b>
<b>and two miscarriages.</b>
<b>I could never muster up</b>
<b>the courage to confide in you.</b>
<b>Do you know why?</b>
<b>You think that</b>
<b>rubbing my temples,</b>
<b>massaging my feet,</b>
<b>and taking me out, is pampering.</b>
<b>But you never even made</b>
<b>an attempt to find out,</b>
<b>what my real problems are.</b>
<b>You have been turning a blind eye</b>
<b>to everything.</b>
<b>You must think</b>
<b>that you love me a lot.</b>
<b>But that's not true.</b>
<b>I am just an obligation to you.</b>
<b>The other day,</b>
<b>mum had to be hospitalised.</b>
<b>That day, I was really scared, Dad.</b>
<b>What if,</b>
<b>after getting married,</b>
<b>I have to face a similar situation?</b>
<b>Won't that scare you, Dad?</b>
<b>'Bhaiji',</b>
<b>are you going to ignore</b>
<b>that question, as well?</b>
<b>Of course, it will scare me.</b>
<b>It will frighten the life out of me.</b>
<b>In our home,</b>
<b>there are more idols of deities</b>
<b>than there are utensils.</b>
<b>And...</b>
<b>amidst that, I forgot to cherish</b>
<b>my own guardian angel.</b>
<b>Please, forgive me.</b>
<b>Sanya,</b>
<b>not just for our home,</b>
<b>you are a role model for all of Karnal!</b>
<b>'This story began at a household.'</b>
<b>'Now that it has gained momentum,</b>
<b>it is going to go a long way.'</b>
<b>'All the answers were</b>
<b>right in front of us,</b>
<b>but the right questions</b>
<b>were never asked.'</b>
<b>'Now, there are</b>
<b>questions about theories,'</b>
<b>'and there are answers</b>
<b>explaining</b>
<b>their practical applications.'</b>
<b>'The discussions are shaping up</b>
<b>in the backyards,</b>
<b>as well as</b>
<b>in the neighbourhoods of the city.'</b>
<b>'This chain reaction is in motion,</b>
<b>and it's far from over!'</b>
<b>'After all,</b>
<b>it's just chemistry!'</b>
<b>I'm Afreen Begum.</b>
<b>My name is Savita Devi.</b>
<b>My name is Seema Shinde.</b>
<b>I am working here</b>
<b>for the past five years,</b>
<b>and my mother works here as well.</b>
<b>'Earlier, everyone was hesitant</b>
<b>to talk about this topic.'</b>
<b>'But now, everyone realizes</b>
<b>the importance of this subject.'</b>
<b>Why should one be hesitant?</b>
<b>It's noble work.</b>
<b>Everyone in my family</b>
<b>knows about my work,</b>
<b>and they are really proud of me.</b>
<b>I am going to continue working here.</b>
<b>What's there to hide?</b>
<b>It's noble work.</b>
