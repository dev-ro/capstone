Some travel partner you are.
You're supposed
to keep the driver company, honey.
- Okay?
- This isn't it.
This is the road. And here, look.
- This is the road.
- Is that the road we're on, Mom?
There won't be any signal out here.
We're not lost. Shit.
We should've stayed
at a hotel in Cardiff.
We wanted to surprise your dad,
didn't we?
Don't you wanna surprise
your dad?
Shit.
We're not lost.
Sweetheart.
Sarah.
Hey.
Sarah, time to go.
Sarah.
Sarah?
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah! Sarah!
- Get out.
- What is it?
Mom. Mom, stop it.
It's just sheep.
Just some stupid sheep.
I have a brilliant idea.
Why don't we go see
if we can find Dad's house.
What do you think?
Are you gonna tell him?
Do you want me to?
No.
Okay.
Where the hell are we?
This is so your father.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Sarah.
Hey.
What a surprise. I wasn't expecting
to see you till tomorrow.
- You're not upset we're early?
- I'm not upset at all. I'm happy.
Hey, why the tears, huh?
- I'm just happy to see you.
- I'm happy to see you too.
Top of the morning to you, James.
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.
How are you?
Wow, look at this house.
- For you.
- Thank you very much.
Sarah wanted to get here, so...
We actually arrived last night...
...but our car got stuck
in the mud down yonder.
- I tried to call, but there's no signal.
- No signal.
So we had a little sleepover
in the car, didn't we, baby?
And we had a close encounter
with some sheep.
- Sure moved far enough.
- Far-off is the way us weirdoes like it.
Dafydd, would you mind giving
us a hand with Adelle's car later?
- No, not at all.
- Thanks.
- This is Dafydd. He can fix anything.
- Hello.
- Dafydd. Is that like David?
- Exactly like David.
- Daf, Dai.
- Dave.
- Hey, Dave.
- Missis.
- Watch these.
- Okay.
Jeez, you're getting big, aren't you?
How old are you? Eighteen, 19?
Quite a nice little hideaway
you've built for yourself.
- Yeah, it's coming along.
- Yeah, well...
Oh, I love this. Look at you painting
and sculpting like crazy.
There's an abattoir
on the property...
...which I'll turn into my studio.
- Really.
- What's an abattoir?
- A place where they kill animals.
- Nice.
- By the way, your rooms are upstairs.
- Can I go see?
- Yeah, sure.
- First door on your left.
- Okay.
So...
So...
- What's wrong with Sarah?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of a loner.
Like father, like daughter, I guess.
She's fine. We're fine.
We just missed you. I...
I missed you.
Here, this is your room.
That's great.
You've been working a lot.
- Look at this.
- Yeah, I know.
It's a bit of a mess.
I'll find somewhere
to put the rest of this stuff.
No, it's fine. It's fine.
- Sarah, where are you?
- I'm up here.
Making a mess already?
Wow, look at this place.
- What do they open?
- I have no idea.
We found them all over the place,
but they don't fit any locks.
- This is a funky little room.
- It's a storage room or something.
- What are we gonna store up here?
- You. If you're bad.
We'll only let you out when you think
about what you did, young lady.
- You like your room?
- It's got a telescope.
Yeah. You can watch out
for ships in distress.
SOS.
Save our souls.
Elvis. Here, boy.
Elvis.
Sarah.
Sarah, don't get
too close to the edge.
Hey.
What did you find there?
- A secret.
- A secret?
Looks like someone
made off with the plaque.
- Now, why would they do that?
- "Ann..." "Annwyn."
Not Annwyn. Annwn.
It's Welsh.
- For what?
- For the place you go after you die.
- Like heaven?
- That's right.
Sarah, better go and find Elvis.
Time to go.
- I'll go with you, baby.
- She's fine.
- Be careful.
- Elvis.
What's it commemorate
anyway?
- Stumblehead, isn't it?
- Stumblehead?
There were some people
who lived up here about 50 years ago.
Kept themselves to themselves.
Made up their own religion
based on old Welsh legends.
Do unto others, sin, salvation,
same as most faiths.
So why put up a monument?
Well, they had themselves
a kind of minister...
...who preached them sick up here.
Till one day,
the lot of them suddenly up...
...and walked off that cliff, looking
for a way to end their earthly suffering.
Jesus, what a way to die.
They didn't think they were dying.
They thought
they were going to Annwn.
You wouldn't wanna change your mind
halfway down.
Sarah.
You okay? I've got you, sweetheart.
You all right?
- I don't know. They came right at me.
- Oh, God, are you all right?
- Oh, baby, look at you.
- I'm fine.
- She's fine. Just a scratch.
- I said I was fine.
She's fine, Adelle.
- Hello? Hello.
- Where have you been?
- Your mommy has been a bad girl.
- You've been out all night.
I'm going to live with Dad.
Sarah, we've been
through this before. Please.
- I talked to him, and he said that...
- I know. He said that...
He said I could stay as long
as I wanted.
Yes, when you're done with school,
you can visit your father in England.
- Wales. I'm going to live with Dad.
- Sarah.
- I know what this is all about.
- It's none of your goddamn business.
It's all about you. You don't love
anybody but your fucking self.
- Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.
- It's okay.
What are you writing about?
I see. Secret, is it? Girl stuff?
Everything all right with you?
You seem a little... I don't know.
You wanna talk about anything?
- No.
- You sure?
No.
Be nice to your mother.
She does her best, you know.
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.
See you later.
Good night.
Good night.
It's all about you.
You don't love anybody...
...but your fucking self.
- Stop it!
Oh, God.
See?
I hate you.
- I hate you.
- Sarah.
I can't stand this anymore.
Elvis, shut your noise.
It's just the bloody sheep.
P-A-l... Paint.
You didn't let me do the N or the T.
- Give me another.
- Okay.
- R-O... Rock.
- Dad, you did it again.
Okay, I'll let you finish it
this time. Honest.
L-O-S-E.
- Lose.
- No.
R. Loser.
- You calling me a loser? Hey.
- Well, if the shoe fits...
- Can we go exploring?
- Sarah.
Do you wanna go for a walk?
Hey.
Listen, I'll show you two a shortcut
down to the beach. Yeah?
Here, put this on, baby.
- Why?
- Because it's cold...
...and you're gonna need it.
- It gets a bit chilly down there.
Fine.
- Hey, Dave.
- You don't wanna come closer.
Dirty work.
These are from yesterday.
They fell from up there.
They didn't fall, they jumped.
- What do you mean, "they jumped"?
- They jumped.
I've seen sheep
behave in many an odd way.
But I've never seen them
do something like this in a while.
Maybe they just got plain fed up, huh?
Couldn't take it anymore.
What are you gonna do with them?
- Funeral pyre.
- I'll give you a hand, Dafydd.
I'll catch up with you, yeah?
I'm so happy we're here, baby.
Look at this place.
What did you find there?
What is it?
Hey, be careful on those rocks,
all right?
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Baby?
Sarah, let's get back to your dad's.
Come on, chop-chop.
Sarah. Come on, let's go.
Where are you? Sarah, let's go.
Sarah. Sarah?
Sarah, come out now. It's not funny.
Sarah.
Sarah. James! James!
James, help us! Ja...
- James!
- Adelle!
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
James.
James, help...
- Help!
- Adelle.
Help. James.
Adelle.
Sarah. Sarah...
Adelle.
Where's Sarah?
- Where's Sarah?
- She fell in the water.
- Oh, God...
- She fell in.
Sarah.
- Sarah.
- Oh, my God. Sarah.
- I let her go.
- Sarah.
- No. No, let me go. Let me go.
- No.
No.
- He'll find her.
- No.
Sarah!
We'll begin again first light
tomorrow morning.
But I must say it...
You should prepare yourself.
My daughter could be alive out there,
waiting for us to find her.
The boats have lights.
Your men have lights.
Then we search
all fucking night if we have to.
I can't stay here, Adelle.
I'm going down to join the search.
Adelle...
We'll find her.
Promise.
I hate you.
- Sarah.
- I can't stand this anymore.
And on the count of three,
I want you to open this door.
Don't test me on this. Sarah.
- Mom.
- One.
- Mom, help me.
- James, help...
Oh, my God. Sarah. Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Are you in here?
Sarah.
Oh, God. Sarah?
Sarah?
Is that who you're looking for?
You won't find her here.
This is where the sheep come
to die.
- The sheep?
- But before they go...
...they must have
the filth taken from them.
And that's what he does
for them with scrapes and hooks...
...he cleans hell from their heads.
He?
- Who is he?
- The Shepherd.
All that you see is of his making.
It's all right.
It's all right.
- I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
- I told you, you won't find her here.
Wait.
Just wait.
I want you to get me in there,
you see?
- Can you get me close to that shelf?
- Not till the tide's back in.
- How long?
- Another hour.
I saw a girl.
- You saw a girl?
- Yes, out in the yard.
- What?
- I followed her out to the abattoir.
- You went to the abattoir?
- Yes. She said something.
She said something
about the shepherd...
...and something else in Welsh
I couldn't understand.
- Adelle.
- I couldn't understand her.
- Adelle, you saw Sarah?
- And when I went to touch her, she...
- Please, Adelle. You saw Sarah?
- No.
You cut your hand.
Why don't you let me
have a look at it.
I don't know why I thought
it was her, but it wasn't.
It wasn't her.
It's okay.
- It's all right.
- It wasn't her.
Before we left New York,
Sarah and I had a fight.
I was a bad mother.
You weren't. You aren't.
You did your best. We both did.
And we made mistakes.
She loves you, Adelle.
We both do.
Shit.
Beg pardon, missis.
I just came to pick up James.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
I'm all right.
I was just... I was just...
I thought I heard
something upstairs, tapping...
...and Sarah and James
play this SOS game.
They used to play this game.
That's what waiting here is like.
It's...
How you holding up?
I don't know how
this could've happened.
I should have been there with them.
Why don't you go back
and stay with her.
I'll let you know if we find anything.
I wasn't there when she was lost.
I want to be there
when she's found.
Who are you?
"Annwn."
Jesus.
"May 16th, 1952.
Put down six sheep. Panicked."
Here, look at this. Okay, okay.
"May 17th, put down seven sheep.
Burnt bodies to contain illness.
Cause unknown."
There's pages of it,
sheep dying for unknown reasons.
Sick shit. Sheep dissection
and trepanning, and then...
And then over here it says...
It says, "She is doing it.
She is killing the sheep."
Who is she?
I don't know who she is, Adelle.
I don't know.
Okay, look at this.
All right, it's her.
- The girl you saw in the abattoir?
- Yes.
The same girl I saw
the night Sarah went missing.
Adelle, we didn't find her.
We didn't find her today.
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes. Yes, I'm listening.
Maybe we're not looking
in the right places.
This is crazy.
Can you hear yourself? Can you?
I'm down there, Adelle.
All those people are down there
looking for our dead daughter.
And you're running around
the moors drawing pictures.
Jesus.
I'm sorry. Adelle.
- Find what you're looking for?
- Oh, yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
Actually, do you speak Welsh?
Only to bother the English.
Would you mind
looking at this for me?
Here.
Well, plain enough, it means:
"The children were received back
into the armpit of Annwn."
- "The armpit of Annwn."
- But probably, more like:
The children were taken
into the embrace of Annwn.
Taken?
Welsh mythology
is full of that sort of thing.
The living and the dead
crossing back and forth, you know.
Like what?
You found it there.
"Creiddylad."
She was pulled
into Annwn by a dark spirit.
Her husband
had to cross over to get her back.
"The Shepherd and his flock."
"Mass suicide."
"The Shepherd
with his late daughter Ebrill."
Ebrill.
Is that who you're looking for?
Ebrill.
James?
James.
Who's there?
Someone out there?
Who's out there?
Open the door.
Open the door.
I can't. I'm afraid.
Sarah?
Sarah?
Is that you?
Yeah, it's me.
Listen to me, okay?
I'm gonna count to three.
And before I get to three,
you will have opened this door.
Okay?
One...
Sarah?
- James, she's here.
- Who's here?
Ebrill, the Shepherd's daughter.
She's upstairs in Sarah's bed.
- Adelle, please.
- She knows where Sarah is.
She knows. She knows.
- You've gotta believe me.
- Sarah drowned.
- Sarah is dead.
- She's not. She's not.
- I feel it. I know it, James.
- Jesus, Adelle, it's over. It's done.
We've called it off. Do you get that?
I've called off the search.
Hush. Don't cry.
Don't cry. Mummy's here.
Ebrill?
Do you remember me
from the abattoir?
You know where Sarah is,
don't you?
James, look at her,
she knows this place. She knows it.
This is the Shepherd's house.
Yes, this was the Shepherd's house,
wasn't it?
A long time ago.
And he lived here...
...all by himself.
No, no.
He lived here with you, Ebrill.
- Don't you remember?
- I was very sick.
That's the room.
Show us. Tell us about the room.
That's the room where
the Shepherd kept his little lamb.
And never let her out,
no matter how she cried.
Don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.
He'd take her out to the place...
...where the sheep go to die.
The abattoir?
Your father cut your head,
like he did the sheep, didn't he?
And she begged and begged him
to stop hurting her head.
But the dark
had to come out of it somehow.
It's okay. It's okay.
- Don't you want your lockbox back?
- No, no, no.
What's in the box, honey?
- Please don't make me go up there.
- Tell me what's in the box.
- Adelle.
- Listen to me.
- She knows where Sarah is.
- Stop it.
Just leave it for a minute, okay?
Let me talk to her.
Come on.
I can't help you unless you tell me
where you came from.
Do you know
where your parents live?
Do you know who you are?
Where you came from?
Why is she so angry at me?
She's not angry at you.
She's just very sad that our...
That our daughter is gone.
Did you love her?
Yeah.
Very much.
Do you think
that she knew that you loved her?
I...
I think so, yes. I hope so.
I think she did.
Look at you. You're filthy.
Let's get you cleaned up and find
someone who knows who you are.
These should fit you.
Okay, when you're done,
you come and talk to me, okay?
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be all right.
Adelle. Adelle.
What are you doing?
What's that?
It's Sarah's sweater.
Look at it. James, it's a message.
- From who?
- From our daughter.
She's telling us how to find her.
I know where she is.
What? Where?
Where is she?
She's gone...
...to a much better place.
You know what this is, don't you?
Do you know what this is?
This is Sarah's sweater.
Tell me where she is.
You know where she is, don't you?
- No.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Adelle.
This is insane.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That girl's head has been cut open
more times than I can account for.
Cut open?
Yes, she was bleeding
from what appeared...
...to be an unhealed
trepanning wound.
That's right, you heard me.
Trepanning. Primitive medicine.
Tapping or cutting
through the bone of the skull...
...to cure diseases
and mental illness.
Who would do
such a thing to a child?
I was hoping
that you might explain that to me.
S.
O.
S.
Mommy.
Help me.
I'm here.
Mom.
Fucker.
My daughter is alive.
Creiddylad.
The sweet young girl
taken beneath the waves...
...and held prisoner
in the land of the dead.
Ebrill has been dead for 50 years, and
now she's here living and breathing.
Explain that to me.
- You should leave it.
- Leave it?
Lmagine what a parent
will do for their child.
Look at me.
Imagine what I'm willing to do.
That's what I've been afraid of.
She was a sickly girl from birth.
And when she died...
...he gave her to the waves.
He gave her to Annwn.
But he couldn't let her go.
He needed her to be with him...
...more than he needed her
to be at peace.
His followers were as his flock.
But he lied to them.
Played upon their fears.
Convinced them
that this was the way to paradise.
He believed the old legends:
One of the living...
...for one of the dead.
Annwn might give back his child...
...if he gave it someone in return.
He killed them all
to bring her back.
Yhat's what he was willing to do
for his child.
Hello.
What happened?
You fell down.
How are you feeling?
Hey, don't cry.
Everything's gonna be all right.
You know what?
You know what you need to do?
You need to picture the thing that
you want more than anything else.
Can you do that?
Don't tell me. Don't tell anyone.
But just keep picturing
that thing that you want.
And one day...
...you'll find that you don't have
to picture it anymore.
It will be right there
in front of you.
Can you see it?
Can you be my daddy?
Oh, sweetheart. I...
I can't.
Why not?
Because I already have a daughter.
What if she never comes back?
Oh, my God, you were there.
Only, I didn't jump.
My father did.
My mother did.
But I was too afraid. I couldn't.
The Shepherd took me in.
And I helped him with the sheep
until Ebrill came back.
- She came back.
- She came back.
Alive.
But something came back with her.
In her.
It was then the sheep began to die.
He locked her
in that room up there.
He tried to cut the dark from her
like we did with the sheep.
Please, no.
Don't, please.
Don't hurt me. Please don't hurt...
But finally I couldn't watch him
hurt her anymore.
Please, Dafydd, unlock the door.
Please.
I unlocked the door.
Father.
And the darkness in her struck out.
She should never have been
brought back from death.
And so I sent her back myself.
I should have gone with her...
...to make sure she stayed.
Because she has found
a way to return from Annwn.
And that way is Sarah.
My daughter is alive.
Get security immediately.
Yes, can I speak to my husband?
He came in with a patient there...
...the young girl found
at Ty Gwyneth earlier this evening.
I'm afraid your husband has left.
Yhe young girl seems to be missing.
- What?
- Do you want to speak to her doctor?
No, that's okay. Thank you.
Thanks very much.
Of course.
Ebrill's gone.
- Are you sure she'll be here?
- She'll be here.
You wait here.
Ebrill, where are you?
I know you're here.
You remember me, don't you?
You can't stay on this side.
You know that.
You belong with the dead.
Ebrill?
Ebrill?
Oh, my God.
Help me. Help me.
No, Ebrill. No.
Dave?
Dave.
Where are you?
Ebrill.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
I never meant to hurt anyone.
Adelle?
Adelle.
Oh, Jesus.
- They died because of me.
- No.
- Everyone dies because of me.
- No. No one's gonna die anymore.
You can fix it. You don't have to do it
alone. I'll help you, all right?
All right? Okay.
She's cold down there...
...and alone.
- She's been calling to you.
- I know. I heard her.
Looks like such a long way down.
But it's not. Really, it's not.
Ebrill. Ebrill.
- Adelle. Don't let her.
- James, wait.
- Wait.
- Ebrill.
Come away from there.
Come away.
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.
Ebrill, I can be your father.
- No.
- I can look after you.
- No.
- Just come away from there.
- I know what I'm doing. Please.
- Come away.
Trust me.
No.
- James...
- Don't.
...I am going to get our baby back.
Father, help me. Help. Help me.
- There must be some other way.
- No.
- I'm going to bring our baby back.
- No.
Please, Adelle. Oh, no.
No.
Oh, God, no.
Ebrill, where are we?
Don't you recognize it?
Sarah knew it right away.
Sarah?
Where is she?
Where is Sarah?
He has her, and he doesn't
think you deserve her, either.
I'm taking her home.
Yry, and see what happens.
Help me, please.
Hurry.
I'm here.
- Oh, baby.
- Help me.
Mommy's coming. Mommy's coming.
Mommy's coming.
Sarah.
Where is my daughter?
Where is she?
Some little lamb has found
her way out through my wall.
- Mom.
- Sarah?
Go and see what happened
to your little daughter.
- Mom, is that you?
- Sarah?
Mommy.
- Mommy.
- Sarah?
Sarah?
Mom. Mom. Mommy.
- Can't you see her?
- Ebrill, is that you?
This is where all of us sick little sheep
have the filth cut from our heads.
We are not sheep.
Oh, yes, we are.
Especially you.
Mom, help me. Hurry.
Help. Help...
Go see what you've woken.
Go see.
Now we'll finish what you started.
Don't you wanna come home,
baby?
Sarah, I want you
to come home with me.
- Home?
- Yes.
Home?
Mother...
...home is where we came from.
Stop it.
See? I hate you.
- Sarah.
- I can't stand this anymore.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Please open the door.
I'm gonna count to three...
...and on the count of three,
I want you to open this door.
Don't test me on this.
One...
Sarah. Sarah? Did you take these?
Oh, my God, Sarah. Sarah, come
here, baby. Come here. Come here.
That's a girl. Come here, baby.
Sarah. That's it.
Sarah.
Don't die.
Don't you want the dark...
...to come out of your head?
- Yes.
- Don't you wanna be clean of it?
- Yes.
- Don't you want me back, Mom?
- Yes, I do.
Then this is the only way.
Stop.
There, that's it.
- How could you do such a thing?
- I don't know.
I don't know where it came from.
It just happened.
- It just happened.
- You killed her.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I just want a second chance.
Please, God,
I want a second chance.
The dead
don't get second chances.
Mother, you know what this is,
don't you?
It's the end.
No, no, no.
- I want a second chance.
- The dead don't get second chances.
I'm not dead.
- I am not dead.
- Oh, yes, you are.
Don't you remember?
We fell from Stumblehead.
The water filled your lungs.
No. I'm alive.
I'm alive. I'm alive.
I'm alive. I'm alive.
Yes. Yes, a drug overdose.
Please, now. Oh, God.
Sleeping pills.
Some kind of sleeping pill.
Okay. Okay. Don't die.
Don't die on me.
I'm alive.
I'm alive. I'm alive.
It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.
You're alive.
I'm alive.
One of the living
for one of the dead.
I'm alive.
- Mom.
- Sarah.
- Mommy.
- Sarah.
- Mom, is that you?
- I'm coming. I'm coming.
Mom.
- I'm here.
- Sarah, are you in there?
Sarah, I can't...
I can't open the door.
- Sarah.
- Mom.
Sarah. Sarah.
Oh, God, I wanna tell you.
I need to tell you.
I am so sorry for being so selfish.
I'm so sorry for everything.
And I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Mom.
Baby. Oh, my baby.
Oh, my baby. Oh, my baby.
Sarah?
Sarah.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Sarah.
James.
Okay.
- Underwater?
- I kept calling for help.
I kept calling for Mom.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe you've come back.
She was right. She was right.
- Daddy?
- Yeah.
Where's Mom?
Oh, Sarah, she...
I'm sorry.
Your mother...
Listen to me, Sarah,
she loved you so much.
She did a very brave thing.
But she's gone now.
- Look at me.
- No.
It's just the two of us.
I can take care of you.
- Look at me.
- No.
It's all right, Sarah. It'll be fine.
I'll take care of you.
Look at me.
Come here.
Don't worry.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I wanna go home, Daddy.
Please take me home.
Yes, we will.
I want you to forget, Sarah.
Mom.
I want you to be happy
and to forget all about this.
Dad.
- Me.
- I love you, baby.
I love your dad too.
I know that now.
Sarah?
Sarah.
Sarah.
Is that who you're looking for?
- What?
- You won't find her here.
What?
What did you just say?
You're not Sarah. You're her.
You're in her.
It's okay.
- It's okay.
- You're not Sarah.
Don't cry. Don't cry.
You brought
your daughter back, Adelle.
You did a very brave thing.
Why?
When I was lost,
I kept picturing this one thing.
One thing
I wanted more than anything.
Because I knew one day
I wouldn't have to picture it anymore.
And what did you picture?
I can't tell you.
It's a secret.
