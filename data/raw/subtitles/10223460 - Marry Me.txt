{\an8}KAT: All right,
let's do it again from the top.
We can cue music.
(SINGING)
Marry me, marry me, say yes
Marry me, marry me, say yes
{\an8}Marry me, marry me
{\an8}Say yes, for the rest
The rest
{\an8}I never seen forever
Oh, yeah
{\an8}I never seen forever
In the wild
{\an8}But now I'm lookin'
Now I'm lookin' in its eyes...
NEWSCASTER: Tomorrow night,
superstar Kat Valdez
and Grammy-winning
hot, hot, hot Bastian
will make history
when they perform
{\an8}their new hit song Marry Me
and exchange vows
{\an8}in front of the whole world.
20 million people.
BASTIAN: See you tomorrow.
I'll be the one in the veil.
And guess who's gonna be
one of them. Me!
Okay, I hear that
she is wearing a Zuhair Murad custom gown
with 10,000
hand-beaded crystals.
I feel so grateful right now
that everything
is the way it is.
I have a beautiful fiance
{\an8}who's so supportive
and loving and...
{\an8}I feel so grateful
for the American fans because
{\an8}they are supporting me and Kat
in a very nice way.
Marry Me is sweeping the country.
Planning the wedding show
has been insane.
Strike that, the world.
Kat Valdez and Bastian
are taking their vows onstage
in New York City tomorrow night,
{\an8}and then jetting off
to a private island
{\an8}where they'll make,
let's hope, more beautiful music together.
{\an8}JUSTIN SYLVESTER:
City National Bank,
bank of the stars,
presents Marry Me.
The end of a tour
and the beginning of a lifetime.
And with me is Colin Calloway,
her manager. How are you?
I'm very well, Justin.
How are you?
I'm good. Now, I heard
this was all Bastian's idea.
Uh, no, no no, they both
wanted to give something back to the fans.
You know, combined, they have
a social reach of over 200 million people?
Uh, yeah, of course I know that.
I'm the manager.
-Who's her bridesmaid?
-Uh...
What about her exes?
Will they be in the audience?
They got some people,
uh, waiting for me,
-so I'm just gonna go and deal with that.
-Just...
Bye, guys.
I hate dealing with managers.
KAT: (SINGING)
Marry me
I want you in my life
So bad
Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma
Marry me
WOMAN 1: Can somebody get this cart?
WOMAN 2: Can somebody help me?
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
It's a gift from Pasquale Bruni.
I mean, if you don't
like it, I'll take it.
-Ah, that's beautiful.
-Oh!
(BOTH LAUGH)
Um, let's pack it
for the honeymoon.
-Okay.
-Okay?
KAT: Oh, more flowers.
My God, this is insane.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
This is nothing.
There's a moving van on Park
stuffed with wedding gifts,
including a stove.
-Someone got me a stove?
-It's from a fan.
Who thinks I don't have a stove?
COLLIN: Yeah, Tyra?
Donate all of it.
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)
-Oh, it's Tom from iHeartRadio.
Tom, the man himself.
Talk to me.
Of course I've got
some tickets for you,
even if we are
completely sold out.
I don't think there's
a single person in this city
who's not clamoring
to come to this wedding.
Think this is one of my better lunches,
but you be the judge.
Dad, don't mess up my hair.
I thought that gave
you good luck.
That was, like, a long time ago.
I think it was about a month ago.
How great is this?
Going to the same school together.
Mm-hm. Great.
Oh. And, Lou, you probably
won't see that much of me.
I know that could be
a problem for you,
but if you
need to see me anytime...
-I won't.
-I like the independence.
Good.
Oh, and you know
the student that you're shadowing, Esther?
Full disclosure,
Esther is in my math club,
but I don't want
you to feel any pressure to join.
I'm not joining.
Tough audience.
(SNORING)
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)
Um... Dad?
-Can I go in alone?
-Of course.
I was just gonna ask you
the same thing.
If I could walk in alone,
you know, for my street cred.
I love you!
You may be good at football,
you may be good at track,
but when it comes
to math clubs...
ALL: You better watch your back!
Coolidge Pi-thons attack!
(HISSING)
Yes! What's our number?
STUDENTS: 3.141592...
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
65839...
-65839...
-Percy, we got it. Good.
Okay, remember,
if you sit in the question,
the answer will find you.
Terrific job today.
I love the energy.
I'm telling you, if we bring
that to the Mathalon finals, we win the...
-Oh, Esther, you got a second?
-Yeah.
How's Lou doing? She good?
I think so.
You know, she's great at math,
so at some point,
I wouldn't be surprised
if she starts asking
about maybe
joining the Pi-thons.
'Cause, you know,
at her last school,
she made it to
the Mathalon finals.
Really? She never mentioned that.
You know, that's the thing.
She's really shy.
Oh, not at all.
She was telling me about her vacation
and about this guy named David.
David? My ex's new husband?
What did she say about him?
-Uh--
-No, it doesn't matter. Never mind.
Actually, go ahead. Tell me.
Oh, just that he's awesome
and no matter what they do,
it's always cool
-and exciting and, you know...
-Fun.
-Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
-Gotcha.
-All right.
-Okay. Thanks, Esther.
I guess they're going cave diving.
-Hmm. Cave diving.
-Yeah.
(DOOR OPENS)
Where?
PARKER: In a stairwell,
spying on your daughter.
-Really?
-CHARLIE: We're not spying.
We're... we're just watching
from a distance.
We're not spying.
Look, she had a hard time
at her last school.
I just want to make sure she's okay.
So, what, you thought
you'd hook her up with the cool kids?
Parker, you're supposed
to set a good example
as the guidance counselor.
I am setting the best example
with my look and my vibe alone.
Jesus, kids still do the robot?
(RINGTONE PLAYING)
Marry me, marry me, say...
-Is that a Marry Me ringtone?
-Guilty.
What's Marry Me?
It's Kat and Bastian's new song.
It's everyone's new song.
-PITTS: It's my new song.
-It's not mine.
People are gonna propose to it.
They're gonna post videos of themselves
dancing to it down the aisle.
-Are you ready to be jealous?
-Yes.
I'm taking my new girlfriend Roxy
and her ex-girlfriend
-to their concert/wedding.
-Shut up.
Where she's gonna
look at me and say...
Hi, baby.
BASTIAN: (ON PHONE) Hi, love.
Did you see my post?
No. You post something?
{\an8}(BASTIAN SPEAKING SPANISH)
{\an8}(READING IN SPANISH)
So, do you like it?
I love it.
I love you.
I love you more, baby.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
-When'll you be home?
-About an hour.
You know there's about
a thousand people
-in this apartment right now?
-What?
{\an8}(SPEAKING SPANISH)
{\an8}I know.
{\an8}(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Twenty million?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, of course.
Oh, my God.
This has gotten so out of control.
(MAN SPEAKING SPANISH
ON PHONE)
BASTIAN: I'm on with Kat. Wait.
Yeah, I just...
Now I just wish it was me and you
on a beach somewhere.
No, my love.
You deserve the biggest
wedding in the world.
And tomorrow's gonna be
the best night of our lives.
-Can't wait. (CHUCKLES)
-I can't wait either, baby.
Bye.
WOMAN: Where's Kat?
An interview in ten minutes.
CHARLIE: Look what I just found.
Scoot over.
I was just
looking through some old pictures.
And look at this one I saw of you,
me and Mom in Jamaica, parasailing.
We went parasailing?
Do you not remember?
I mean, to be honest,
I don't remember you together at all.
Well, we were, and we had fun.
I get it, Dad. You were a fun guy.
I was, and I am a fun guy.
(CHARLIE SIGHS HEAVILY)
But, you know,
it's not just about fun.
It's... It's harder than that.
It's work. It's...
Well, think about Tank.
When Tank was a puppy.
-You remember that?
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
You remember how fun he was
and playing tug-of-war with the Frisbee
and him jumping around?
And now he's old,
and his eyes don't work,
and you don't know
how many good years he has left,
-but you still...
-Dad, is Tank dying?
No. No.
I'm sorry, I... Tank's good.
I got a little off track.
I was just...
What I meant is that
love is about sacrifice
and the day-to-day.
Um, dad, uh, can I go to sleep now?
Yeah, of course. Yeah.
-Okay. Goodnight.
-Okay.
Night.
FALLON: Last time
she was here, Kat Valdez,
who let's just say
is no stranger to weddings...
(CROWD LAUGHING ON TV)
...said she wanted to do
something smaller,
understated, intimate,
with just, say,
5,000 of their closest fans.
-I mean friends.
-(CROWD LAUGHING ON TV)
Just a simple wedding
for a simple gal.
-Just like Mom's wedding was.
-(CROWD LAUGHING ON TV)
SEACREST: (ON RADIO)
Hey, good morning, New York.
It's 102.7. This is Seacrest with you.
ENRIQUE SANTOS: (ON RADIO)
Kat and Bastian fans,
it's Enrique Santos with you.
MALE RADIO HOST 1:
Tonight, Kat Valdez and Bastian
will give it all they got
and tie the knot.
MALE RADIO HOST 2:
Today is the big day.
MALE RADIO HOST 3:
That shit is crazy, man.
KAT: (READING) "Then on the shore of
the wide world I stand alone, and think,
"Till love and fame
to nothingness do sink."
It's Keats. You think he'll like it?
If somebody explains it to him, yeah.
It's beautiful.
Oh, today is your wedding day!
-Aah!
-(EXCLAIMS) Yeah! Yes! Yes!
Get it. Get it.
Tomorrow would've been
our anniversary.
You guys went out
for what, two weeks?
Seventeen days,
if you include the breakup.
And she dumped me with a text.
So rude.
Come to the Kat Valdez concert
with me tonight.
Parker, I'm not
a big concert person.
Listen, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime invitation,
and you don't even get it.
This is Halley's Comet.
It's you wearing an outfit
that flatters your body.
It's very rare.
Okay, I've got Lou tonight.
Good. I've got three tickets.
Bring her.
Maybe she'll think you're fun.
(SINGING)
Church, church, church, church
Church, church, church

Yeah
I'm down on my knees
I've fallen for you
You've opened my gates

(ALL CHEERING)
WOMAN: We love you, Kat!
Yeah!
Thank you so much for being here
on such a monumentally
special occasion.
How's everybody feeling tonight?
(ALL CHEERING)
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Are there any Latinos in the house?
(CHEERING)
Well, I am looking
for one in particular.
(BASTIAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Yeah! (LAUGHS)
-(ALL CHEERING)
-KAT: Yes.
{\an8}Ooh, hold this.
Hey, Roxy, check out
my new best friends.
Oh, yeah, and suck it!
BASTIAN: That beautiful woman
is gonna be my wife.
{\an8}I should've worn my onesie.
(LAUGHS) Charlie.
(SINGING IN SPANISH)
Yeah.
Something's wrong.
-Where?
-Page Six.
Are you guys
ready for the wedding?
(ALL CHEERING)
(SINGING IN SPANISH)
-Where's Tyra?
-WOMAN: In Bastian's dressing room.
-Oh, perfect.
-Dancers, to the stage in five!
(SINGING IN SPANISH)
(CHEERING)
KAT: Mel! Where's Mel?
What's everybody looking at?
I know the groom is not supposed to see
the bride before the wedding.
Can I just say, "Wow."
No.
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen...
the moment you've all
been waiting for.
(CROWD CHEERING)
-What's the matter?
-Everything's fine.
-Something's weird.
-Nothing to worry about.
What's everybody looking at?
-Forget about them.
-Give me your phone.
Now!
It might not be real.
(CROWD CHEERING)
Marry Me! Marry Me!
{\an8}NEWSREADER:
A Page Six exclusive.
{\an8}An anonymous poster
sent us this hot video
{\an8}that's gonna blow your mind.
{\an8}Kat Valdez's husband-to-be Bastian
{\an8}was caught cheating on her
with her assistant.
(ANNOUNCER SPEAKING SPANISH)

(INAUDIBLE)
Can you...
Can you stop the music?
Oh, shit.
And, uh, can you
turn up the house lights?
Yeah.
(ALL GASP)
WOMAN 1: We love you, Kat.
MAN: Kat, we love you!
WOMAN 2: Kat!
-I'm okay.
-WOMAN 3: Kat, you're a goddess!
I'm told that, uh...
(SNIFFLES)
...20 million people are
supposed to watch me sing Marry Me
to the love of my life...
(CROWD CHEERING AND CLAPPING)
...and then watch as we take our vows.
(CROWD CHEERING AND CLAPPING)
I didn't know
she was gonna do this. Beautiful.
So it's only natural that I would
want to see who I'm talking to.
WOMAN 1: We love you!
WOMAN 2: Kat, we love you!
Probably didn't know
about this either, did you?
Only natural that I say something,
if not about marriage,
then about... love.
Because that's what
we're all looking for, right?
(CROWD CHEERING IN AGREEMENT)
-Love?
-WOMAN: Yes!
NEWSREADER:
A Page Six exclusive...
We get so caught up in what
we want our life to be that...
(CROWD MUTTERING IN AGREEMENT)
...we forget what our love actually is.
-A lie.
-(CROWD MURMURING)
MAN: It's okay! We love you!
A fairy tale that
you sold yourself so long ago
that you forgot that wasn't real.
But deep down, you knew.
MAN: We love you, Kat.
(ALL CHEERING)
We love you, Kat!
MAN: We love you!
She's making a fool of herself.
-(KAT CRYING)
-No.
KAT: Somehow you knew.
You did that.
You realize that it wasn't love at all.
You were just in love
with the idea of who
you wanted that person to be.
But you can't marry an idea.
You know, they say,
if you want something different,
you have to do something different.
So this time, for the first time,
you make a different choice.
You jump off a cliff so high
you can't even see the fall.
And you just...
(CROWD CHATTERING)
MAN: I don't know.
I don't know.
...say yes.
Why not?
Sure.
I'll marry you.
You.
(CROWD GASPING)
{\an8}Dad. Dad, that's you.
WOMAN: I thought it would be Bastian,
but it's just some guy
wearing a windbreaker.
Maybe he's a celebrity
wearing a mask.
-Is this for real?
-Yeah, it's for real!
Jesus H. She's talking to you.
Charlie, go! Go!
-Go!
-Go!
ALL: Go!
{\an8}(CROWD CHANTING) Go! Go! Go!
{\an8}(WOMEN SCREAMING)
(CROWD CHEERING)
(HERE COMES THE BRIDE PLAYING)
Oh, my God.
Do you, Katrina Valdez,
take this guy to be
your lawfully wedded husband?
And, I mean, really take him.
Think hard, girl.
(CROWD CHATTERING)
-I do.
-WOMAN: Wait, what?
And do you, some guy,
take Kat to be your lawfully
wedded wife?
WOMAN: No! Bastian!
MAN: Do it!
ALL: Yeah!
It's on you, bro.
(OVERLAPPING CHATTER FROM CROWD)
WOMAN: Say yes!
Okay.
We'll take "okay."
By the power vested in me
by the state of New York,
I now declare you
husband and wife.
(CROWD CHEERING)
(CROWD SILENCES)
(CROWD CHEERING)
-Kat.
-Get the hell away from me.
-Can I just explain...
-I'm serious!
-Get her out of here!
-Clear this area.
GUARD: Everybody out, please.
MAN: What's going on? What happened?
{\an8}Baby...
{\an8}(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Screw you, Bastian!
We got in that fight in Miami,
then you told me to get out.
Oh, so this is all my fault?
It's nothing. It was nothing.
-Get me out of here.
-(SPEAKING SPANISH)
-Just... Whoa, just...
-Wait.
Who the hell do you think
you are, man? Some fan?
No, I'm not a fan. Just...
Well, I mean, I am now.
Okay. We're done.
You lot, get your phones down.
Show's over. Go, go, go.
Carl, take these two
round the back.
I'll have you send
decoys round the front.
-CARL: Listen.
-Just get him out of here!
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
Hey, move.
Hold him there. Hold him there.
Terry, I'm good.
(BREATHING INTENSIFIES)
That was crazy.
I'm sorry.
I don't know exactly what to say
or what just happened,
but I know on some level
you must have really
cared about that guy.
I was marrying him.
Good point.
He's going to age badly.
No, he's not.
Yeah, you're right.
He's probably just gonna
get better looking.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm really sorry about all this.
Me, too.
You gonna be okay?
Jeff will take you home.
Okay. Goodnight.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
PARKER: (OVER PHONE)
Charlie, finally.
Hey. How's Lou?
She's fine.
She's at her mom's. Where are you?
I'm in a garage.
I'm on my way home.
Hold on. You're saying
you haven't seen it?
Oh, my God.
You are everywhere.
Online, on television, on...
What do you mean "television"?
FALLON: (ON TV)
Did you hear Kat Valdez got married
to a different stranger
at the concert tonight?
-Do you believe that?
-(CROWD LAUGHING ON TV)
On the way home
from the concert tonight,
Kat Valdez also left
the guy from the concert,
then married her Uber driver,
and then...
(CROWD LAUGHS ON TV)
Now he's... he's driving them
to the honeymoon
in Turks and Caicos,
where she will marry the bellboy.
It's very... It's all...
It's all happening...
(FEMALE NEWSREADER
SPEAKING SPANISH)
(CRYING)
COLLIN: There you are.
You need anything?
Just...
tell me it didn't happen.
Why do I always pick the wrong guy?
I let everyone down.
No, no. No, you didn't.
I can't get out
of my own way.
Come here. Come here.
It's all right.
We'll figure it out.
-I promise.
-(SOBBING)
I promise.
We'll figure it out.
Well, the good news
is there was a wedding last night.
The bad news is it was not a joke.
I have two things to say.
-First, Kat, we love you...
-It's Bastian.
He says he just
needs five minutes.
Hang up and turn that off.
I got to go.
God, he's unbelievable.
What now?
Well, he's going to Puerto Rico.
He says he needs
to get his head together.
Huh. Whatever.
Kat, he was crying.
Not helping.
You all right?
No.
Okay, well, I did
a bit of digging last night,
and it turns out,
out of 10,000 potential dumpster fires,
you picked a decent,
straight, single father
with no criminal record,
and get this,
he's a maths teacher.
-And that's good?
-It's great.
He's not gonna be a problem.
I say we offer $5,000,
get him to sign an NDA
and let it all blow over.
Or...
Or?
Or I could stay married to him.
(CHUCKLES GOOFILY)
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
You're not kidding.
You can't. We can't.
It's not legal. We didn't file papers.
So file the papers.
Wha...
I mean, play
the record through here.
I started
something last night,
and if I don't finish it, I look crazy.
"Er." You'll look crazier.
(EXHALES)
Namaste.
Yeah, we got to get
out in front of this.
Now, he thinks
he can publicly humiliate me? Screw him.
This is a manic response
to an insane situation.
No, we have to change
the narrative.
All right? I'm not
marrying him forever.
It's just for a month,
uh, a few months.
Now, presuming
the man you married
doesn't have a girlfriend or a life,
and presuming I can
get him to agree,
I'm not sure
exactly what we're telling the world.
You don't want to be a joke.
I don't want to be
the punch line.
We have to embrace
the spontaneity of the moment
and just say...
"Nothing else has worked.
"Maybe this will."
You know what they say to do
when your car's skidding
out of control, Colin?
Close your eyes and pray?
Hit the gas and turn into it.
Wait, what are you saying?
Rethink the paradigm.
We're not selling
the world a fairy tale.
We're taking
the fairy tale off the table.
That's what you did last night.
-That's what I did?
-Yeah.
Look, I was just
trying to help someone who seemed like
they were in the middle
of a nervous breakdown.
We're calling it
a break from tradition.
A moment of clarity where
she picked you out of a crowd
and you, my friend, picked her.
I don't even know her.
Kat Valdez is a legend.
Self-made.
She was raised by a single father
who died before she had
any kind of success.
Now she's a woman north of 35
in a business
that marginalizes women at any age.
People love their artists
to bare their souls,
then vilify them if they go too far.
Well, I'm not gonna
let them do that to her.
-And I'm asking you to help me.
-How?
Stand beside her for three months.
And what does she think about this?
It was her idea.
-She had the idea for...
-Yeah.
What if we offered you $10,000?
No. No, no, no. Wrong approach.
Offer him, like, a fundraiser.
He'll go for that.
Oh... Hi. I'm sorry. Are you two...
Ew. Gross. No.
Parker Debs, guidance counselor.
Same school.
How about, uh,
we host a fundraiser for your math club?
Don't answer that. Okay.
What about if it's, like,
instead of three months, it's six months,
and it could be,
like, a whole math wing?
I'm thinking about the children.
Yeah, this is ridiculous.
I don't think anyone's gonna believe
that she's gonna go from Bastian to me.
-That's a good point.
-Well, the fact is
that she did go
from Bastian to you.
Counterpoint.
We're not pretending you're in love.
We're just gonna say
that you're getting
to know each other,
and if it goes further,
then great, and if it doesn't...
It won't. Come...
-Not with that attitude.
-Well, then it doesn't have to.
This is about this moment.
Managing the media
frenzy until things die down.
I have a daughter.
I don't want
to drag her into the middle of a circus.
I can assure you, we won't impinge
on your life whatsoever.
How does it feel
to not be a nobody?
How do you feel about her being so much
hotter than you, Charlie?
Hey, Charlie! Right here!
Hey, Charlie, are you gonna go through
with this? Where's the honeymoon?
Did you get
a good look at him?
Yeah. He's cute.
What?
-He's fine.
-COLLIN: Hey.
Charlie, come in.
Oh, she's right there. Jesus.
Come over, guys.
Charlie, Kat. Kat, Charlie.
-Hi. Oh.
-How are you? Oh.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
-Okay. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
-I'm Parker.
I'm... I am the one
who brought Charlie to the concert,
-so I'm...
-CHARLIE: Yep. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Basically, I guess
I'm responsible for this whole thing.
Hi, Parker.
Hey, Kat.
Hi.
Would you do me a favor,
uh, just two seconds,
and just say,
"Roxy, you really blew it"?
Today Show is a go
at 10:00 on Tuesday.
-Sorry.
-They want...
Charlie.
Charlie in studio
and Kat remote from London.
-Kat.
-Excuse me one second.
-I just have to take a call.
-Okay.
-Bye, Kat.
-Everything's set up...
-She's like a real person.
-All right, so what's going on?
Oh, we're booking
interviews all week.
Uh-huh. I thought
that's what today was.
No, no. Today's more
of a press conference.
But throughout the next few weeks,
we're gonna have some sit-downs and B-roll
and news outlets following us,
charting the progress
as you two get to know each other.
It's all in your email.
I don't check my emails a lot.
How do you schedule your life
if you don't check your email?
Easy. I can't do anything
between 8:00 and 3:00
Monday through Friday,
and I have math club after school,
and three days a week,
I have my kid.
Beyond that,
I'm pretty much available.
-So, sorry...
-Melissa.
Melissa, you're gonna
have to move The Today Show.
What? Excuse me?
We don't move The Today Show.
We move for The Today Show.
-He's gonna have to shift his schedule.
-Okay, I'll handle it.
Okay, I can handle my own life.
I can help him handle it.
Uh, Melissa,
shouldn't you be posting Vitamix?
That's Tyra's job.
Oh. Right.
Morning, everybody.
I don't know about you guys,
but when I get up in the morning,
I like to meditate.
I also love to have fresh juice.
So I like to juice daily with my Vitamix.
I take my fresh greens, mix and go.
Okay, look, I hate
to interrupt an artist
while she's juicing,
but we're gonna have to draw
a hard line when it comes
to the students
-and the schedule, okay?
-Yeah.
You're a little shiny.
Awesome. Let's take a selfie.
I don't feel comfortable.
-I really don't feel this is my world.
-It's natural.
It just feels like everyone walking around
is, like, a sycophant.
Everything in her life is sponsored.
-I know, but don't ruin this for me.
-No, but listen to me.
-I...
-COLLIN: Hey.
-How we doing?
-I'm sorry.
I don't... I don't think
it's gonna work out.
It's just perspective.
No, it's not just perspective.
You see her as some pop star
with endorsement deals,
a narcissist who takes
meaningless selfies,
but that's not the full...
Well, I mean, is a selfie
ever meaningful? I mean...
Look up.
Look, I don't mean to be negative,
but I'm not a big social media person.
I feel it's kind of a distorted reality.
I'm so glad I came to your TED Talk.
No, come on. I see it
all the time in my students.
-It's...
-WOMAN: Kat's ready to walk.
Okay, she's ready.
COLLIN: Social media
can also reach people.
-No, I know. Yeah.
-It can be a tool.
You know what a tool is,
though, right, Charlie?
-Okay. Thank you, Melissa.
-PARKER: Burn.
I know this is a lot.
Just go out there
and be yourself.
Myself probably
wouldn't be here, but...
Listen, if you don't
want to do this...
Uh... What, then I leave?
I thought you said he was into this.
-COLLIN: He is.
-He can hear you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kat Valdez and her new husband,
Charlie Gilbert.
(APPLAUSE)
So, you think it's romantic
marrying a complete stranger?
Uh, impulsive, without a plan.
-But, hey, look where my plans got me.
-(LAUGHING)
So, you just
threw caution to the wind
and thought...
{\an8}I didn't think, actually.
It was a moment.
You're banking a lifetime on a moment?
No, I'm banking a moment on a moment.
Get enough of those,
and that's a lifetime.
You know nothing about each other.
Did you think twice?
Charlie?
People meet randomly
all the time.
At a... At a bar or...
Online.
Yeah, online, at 7-Eleven.
(LAUGHING)
I mean, why is this any crazier?
To state the obvious, you got married.
Yeah, and...
Now we get to know each other.
-But not as man and wife?
-KAT: No.
That would be nuts.
Just for her.
For me, it would be pretty amazing.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Last night, I held up a friend's sign
asking a woman to marry me,
and she said, yes,
and I did, and...
you know, I did it not, you know,
because she was beautiful...
-Well, maybe a little...
-(REPORTERS LAUGH)
Uh, but it just seemed like,
in the moment, the right thing to do.
So, what, you just saw
each other and said, yes?
BOTH: Yes. (BOTH CHUCKLE)
And that doesn't seem frivolous?
Historically, marriage was transactional.
It was about expanding your empire,
and a woman's value
was based on what she brought.
Like, "You give me a heifer,
and I'll give you my daughter."
(MUTTERING)
CHARLIE: It's terrible. I know. That's...
You know, I didn't come up with it.
But it really was a business deal,
and it wasn't designed
to be about love,
and maybe that's where people
kind of get tripped up now.
MALE REPORTER: This is your
second marriage, right, Charlie?
You wouldn't want to fail again.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Well, you haven't lived
unless you've failed, Bill.
You should know that
from your time at CNBC.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Listen, what we did was crazy.
We know that, but, you know,
it was just truly a leap of faith.
The rules as they exist
pretty much suck for women.
I mean, why do
we have to wait for men to propose?
Why is everything on his terms?
No, I think it is time
to shake things up.
How about this? We pick the guy,
we keep our name
and let him earn the right to stay.
(CHEERING IN AGREEMENT)
That was terrific.
No, no, seriously. Oh, and listen.
Don't worry about Tuesday.
We'll adjust our schedule around yours.
-It'll be fine.
-Thanks. I appreciate it.
-No, of course.
-We'll try not to
turn your life
upside down too much.
CHARLIE: I think it might be
a little too late for that.
I mean, do you ever
get used to this?
Just the attention
and the chaos and the people everywhere?
I don't know.
Some days, you barely notice.
Other days, you feel like...
a panda in a zoo.
You should know that up front.
Got it.
-Where you off to now?
-Oh, London, for a meeting.
And I'm off to Flatbush for a dog,
which pretty much sums it up.
I'll see you at the next photo op?
Okay.
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)
Don't forget to check your schedule.
I got it.
OMG. He can't even text with that.
OMG. Yes, he can.
(WHISPERS) But very slowly.
(MOUTHING)
PARKER: You did not look nervous,
and you know what, you kind of have
offbeat good looks
for someone...
-Offbeat?
-Charlie Valdez!
-Charlie, over here!
-What are they doing here?
Relax. We're famous now.
REPORTER 1: Is this a throuple?
Where's your wife?
Why don't you live with her?
Why are you yelling at me?
-I'm standing right here.
-REPORTER 1: Come on, Charlie.
-I'm gonna go inside.
-REPORTER 1: What are you doing?
REPORTER 2:
Are you now Mr. Valdez?
REPORT 1: Are you
in the doghouse, huh?
Gonna be a short walk.
(STRAINING)
Go inside. I'll deal with this.
REPORTER 3: You been
kicked out already?
The dog can't shit
if people are watching.
Luckily, I can only shit
if people are watching,
so if you're feeling lucky...
I'm busy, too, by the way.
(CROWD CHEERING)
BASTIAN: What's your name, baby?
WOMAN: Janice.
BASTIAN: Janice.
You look so sexy tonight.
(WOMEN CHEERING)
KAT: I don't know about you guys,
but when I get up in the morning,
I like to meditate.
I also love to have fresh juice.
So I like to juice daily with my Vitamix.
Could we get a Vitamix?
I'd like to juice daily.
Come on. Put that down.
No electronics at dinner.
What do you call that?
I call that a nature documentary,
so we can travel while we eat.
Put it down.
So, is Kat, like, my stepmom?
No, Lou. Come on.
Dad, I think this experience is actually
really good for you.
Says my 12-year-old?
It's true. I mean, you never just, like,
do things without planning them.
I think it's cool.
I really want to meet her.
I mean, Parker says she's nice,
and smart, and next-level hot.
She is nice. She is...
She's an attract...
Here, let me get this.
Dad, she just hit 80 million
followers on Instagram.
CHARLIE: Okay. I'm not impressed.
Talk to me when she gets
to 90 million, okay?
Lou, it's not real.
It's all a facade.
You know, they had me wearing makeup.
You wear makeup now?
Wore once. Never again.
Well, you never say never,
but I don't plan on it
in the next couple months
that we're doing this.
And you're saying
the whole time I can't meet her?
I don't think
Mom would want that.
Actually, Mom wants
to meet her, too.
Oh, perfect.
Lou, you know
that we're not really together.
Her manager stages things. Look.
-You have an iPhone?
-Yeah.
I mean, it's just for scheduling.
-They're making me use it.
-Huh.
Yeah, bowling, and then we're gonna
do a photo shoot, so...
Uh-huh. But do you guys,
like, talk ever?
It's just publicity. It's not real.
Hmm.
Yeah! Come on!
Okay, your turn.
Don't be nervous. It's just, uh...
It's not a competition. Just having fun.
Okay, no. I'm guessing
from the way you're holding
that that you haven't done
-too much bowling.
-Uh, what do I do?
Well, you're gonna want
to put your fingers
-in the holes there.
-Yeah. Uh-huh.
This one, yeah.
Get your thumb in that one.
{\an8}-There? That one? Okay.
-Yep. And then take
{\an8}three steps kind of...
You want to land on your left,
and don't be afraid
to use those little...
A strike is better
than a spare, right?
That is not your first time bowling.
Yes! Did you get that?
-Come on! The old rope-a-dope.
-Yes!
Oh, my God. I wish I put money on this,
because people are loving it.
-What people?
-Well, this is an Instagram live feed,
and 237,000 people
are like, "Why is he
such a boring nerd?"
-Mel.
-What? Their words, not mine.
Get off the live, Mel.
All right.
So, we just need a little bit more
B-roll for The Today Show.
Well, I've got to get home to Tank.
-Is Tank his daughter?
-Stop.
-Okay.
-You have to go?
Yeah, if you guys are done with me.
Mm-hmm. We're going to a party.
You go.
Where's home?
KAT: Wow. Cool.
Thanks.
Yeah, it's a...
Kat, meet dog.
Wow, I never heard
that one before.
Sorry. That was pretty... ruff.
(LAUGHS)
You are so lucky
that Mel didn't hear you say that.
No, I'm lucky Mel isn't here.
I feel like you're never alone.
What? I'm alone now.
Well, I mean, yeah, other than Kofi.
KAT: Just ignore him.
CHARLIE: Is everything you do filmed?
-KAT: Banked.
-Banked?
For my channel.
Just little mini episodes of life.
Uh...
Can we skip an episode?
-Want me to go?
-KAT: Yeah, you can go.
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-KOFI: Goodnight. I'll see you.
Happy?
Relieved.
Is this your daughter?
CHARLIE: Yeah.
KAT: She's cute.
Thanks. Yeah, she's great.
Although she is
in that awkward in-between phase
where she's still my baby girl,
but she definitely
wants nothing to do with me.
And you can forget
about getting hugs,
'cause it's not happening anymore,
which kind of breaks my heart,
but that's the way it goes.
What happened with her mom?
I mean, I'm sorry, you don't...
You know, it's none of my business.
You don't have to tell me.
No, it's okay. Um...
We were married,
and we actually had a good marriage.
You know, then,
I don't know,
all of a sudden, I got the feeling
she didn't want it
or she didn't want me anymore,
and I had nothing
to do but let her go.
And, you know,
statistically, we're screwed,
'cause 48% of marriages
end in divorce, so...
That means 52% work.
Ah, an optimist.
(KAT CHUCKLES)
-This is so cool. Can I?
-Yeah.
And then I think when you get up to,
like, second and third,
then it jumps up to,
like, 67% failure rate.
Even if it's one in a billion,
what does it matter?
It's worth a shot.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
I believe in marriage.
Jesus, still?
Haven't you been
married like six times?
Three times.
Not including this. This is four.
But the first time
was only 48 hours, so...
doesn't count.
But still, do you ever
feel like just kind of,
"I'm waving the white flag
on marriage. That's it."
No, it's like math.
When you get a problem wrong,
you just don't give up on it.
You keep trying till you get it right.
CHARLIE: And what about
you and Bastian?
How long were
you guys together?
Mm. Year and a half.
I'd just split
from my second husband.
He was a music producer
who did, uh,
my last two albums
and then sold a sex tape.
-(SUCKING TEETH)
-That's not the worst part.
The worst part is
I thought I could fix things.
Pretty hard to fix a sex tape.
Right.
Sorry. Yeah,
it's just a little power nap.
-Pacing himself.
-Hmm.
If we give him a minute,
he'll... he'll restart.
-Okay.
-But you were saying?
Well, this business,
those type of guys,
they build you up
to break you down.
But you were
already famous, so...
It's not about fame.
You know, it's about credibility.
It just didn't matter
how successful I was.
They never gave it to me.
You know, I've never been
nominated for anything?
And then I met Bastian.
And he...
And he gave me this.
"Sing." What does that mean?
It means "Don't let them win."
Nobody's all bad, Charlie.
If they were, it would
make it so much easier.
But cheating on you with
your assistant is pretty bad.
Okay. (STRAINING)
Zoo mates.
Zoo mates.
See, we're not
so different, Charlie.
(KAT SINGING)
You know I tried so long
Come on. Come on!
It's not a big...
Every time I thought
I found it, I was wrong
I swear I must've spent
A thousand nights
Lookin' for somebody
Who could hold me tight
Until I realized
I am the love of
The love of my life...
COLLIN: The Marciano brothers
and Kat Valdez
are telling the world
there's no age limit.
-Is that right?
-Guess so.
I am the love of
The love of my life
I am the love of
The love of my life
I was just waiting
For you...
Think we've got everything we need.
We'll post to our socials,
so... you're all set.
All right.
Maybe... Is it okay if I stay?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.
Make yourself at home.
I can't tell you now
I don't know why
Don't know why
And now
I'll pick myself up
One more time
One more time
You know I tried so long
Every time I thought
I found it, I was wrong...
-Bye.
-Bye.
-Hey.
-Hey, Mom.
How you doing?
Hold me tight
Until I realized
I am the love of
The love of my life...
There's a picture
of you buying her a pregnancy test.
-Charlie!
-No.
No, that was
a stool softener for Tank.
I ain't got nobody else
On my mind...
NEWS REPORTER: Kat Valdez and
her new husband, Charlie Gilbert.
-What do I do?
-Just stand and smile.
Charlie! Charlie!
REPORTER 1: Oh, my God, it's Bastian!
WOMAN: Bastian!
REPORTER 2: Bastian,
Bastian! Over here!
(REPORTERS CHATTERING)
Guys, this way.
How about the three of you together?
No hard feelings, man. Yeah?
-No feelings at all.
-(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
{\an8}Mm. Mamacita.
{\an8}REPORTER: Bastian, one
with the three of you.
{\an8}(SPEAKING SPANISH)
{\an8}REPORTER 1: What
did he say to you?
REPORTER 2: Kat, Bastian,
Charlie, this way!
REPORTER 1: What did he say, Charlie?
REPORTER 2: Look, Bastian! Bastian!
Thank you, guys.
My Spanish is a little rusty,
but he said,
"You're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.
"I'm such an idiot.
"And why did I get
that neck tattoo?"
You okay?
I'm good.
CHARLIE: Now, where are you?
KAT: Paris, for a show.
CHARLIE: Oh...
-Paris!
-CHARLIE: Is it weird having
everyone in the world
know who you are?
No, what's weird is that everyone in
the world thinks they know who I am.
CHARLIE: Yeah, I bet.
And you're headed
home after that?
Well, um, I'm home tomorrow,
but then I have
that private in Japan.
What's a private?
KAT: I get paid a fortune
to sing songs
to like ten insanely rich people.
CHARLIE: Do you think
maybe they'd want
to watch someone do
some math problems?
(KAT LAUGHS) I'll ask.
CHARLIE: All right,
well, I'll let you go,
but call me if you're lonely.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
KAT: I'm lonely.
(LAUGHS)
It's been like 13 seconds.
Are you brushing your teeth?
-Yes.
-Are you going to bed?
It's like 8:00 p.m. there.
Um...
-Maybe.
-Wow.
Well, I'm gonna read.
I'm not gonna go right to bed.
-How's Lou?
-She's really good.
She finally agreed
to join the math club,
which makes me happy,
'cause she's phenomenal at math
even though she doesn't
want to be.
Well, maybe she just
doesn't want to be you.
That's for certain.
But it's not really that.
It's more that she's afraid, and,
you know, she almost won
the Mathalon when she was 11.
-The Mathalon?
-Yeah, the Mathalon.
It's kind of like
the Grammys for math,
except there's like
four people in the audience.
-Ah.
-She kind of froze in the finals,
and then some kids
made fun of her and...
I just want her to find her place.
Just give her a minute.
Yeah, definitely.
Okay, well, I'm glad you were lonely.
(CHUCKLES)
I guess I'll let you get to bed now.
-Bye.
-Okay.
So long. Adios.
(LAUGHS) Bye.
See you.
Yeah.
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
Okay, after you've completed
the prime factorization,
identify the distinct prime factor.
All right, listen up, Coolidge Pi-thons.
-I'm here on official business.
-Park...
First of all,
who didn't get their waiver signed?
All right, you two, out.
Hey, you can't just dismiss my students.
(MOCKINGLY) Yes, I can.
You heard me. Scram. Beat it!
Now, for the rest of you
who know how to follow direction,
I bring you the one, the only...
(STUDENTS GASP)
(SCREAM IN EXCITEMENT)
Kat, I love you!
Percy, stop yelling. She's right here.
Hi.
Thought you had a private
for, like, a fortune.
I rescheduled.
PARKER: All right, who's got
a question for Kat?
-I do!
-Me!
Say something smart.
Don't embarrass me.
Uh, George.
Did you really kiss Katy Perry?
Actually, she kissed me.
ALL: Ooh.
-PARKER: Next.
-Oh!
Uh, not George.
-Spencer.
-Don't care.
Why is Mr. Gilbert better than Bastian?
Well...
he didn't cheat on me
with my assistant.
ALL: Ooh.
Okay, you guys caught us
right in the middle
of our mock Mathalon training,
which you're welcome to stay
and enjoy for a little bit.
Uh, Lou, you're up.
-(WHISPERS) Dad, no.
-KAT: Is that Lou?
Yeah.
Finally. Hi.
-I've wanted to meet you forever.
-Me, too.
PARKER: Are you kidding me?
They haven't met?
-No.
-What is wrong with you?
-Well, they...
-(WHISPERS) You're married.
Can we forget about
the mock Mathalon?
I have a million
questions for Kat.
Yeah, and Lou's too scared to
get up in front of people anyways.
Shut up, Jose.
Oh, well, don't worry.
I totally get it.
You know, sometimes
when I have to get up in front of an arena
with thousands and thousands
of people, I get so nervous.
-(CHATTER IN DISAGREEMENT)
-No, I'm serious. I'm afraid I'll choke.
Okay, Mel, pull up "Kat VMAs 2010."
-I've got it.
-Okay.
-Hey, Google.
-Look at this.
Show me a video,
"Kat Valdez 2010 VMA performance."
{\an8}(SINGING) Number nine, yeah
I'm going up
{\an8}I'm getting so high
{\an8}I'm not the sa...
{\an8}KAT: Hey, Google. That's enough.
(ALL GROANING)
Yeah.
I forgot the lyrics on live TV
to a song that I wrote.
It could happen to anybody.
Yeah, but the point is
that once it does,
you're always worried, you know?
What if it happens again?
What did you do?
I shifted focus.
I made my dance so hard
that all I could do
was concentrate on the steps.
So, it's like
you distracted your mind.
Yes. Exactly.
Concentrating on the dance steps made me
forget how scared I was.
Mel, we're gonna need
some speakers.
Not too loud, right?
(SINGING)
I just got paid...
STUDENTS: Hey!
KAT: And two.
And free your mind,
and three and four.
Make a turn, three and four.
Again, three and four.
And three and hour.
And one and two,
and three and four.
And ask a question,
three and four.
Look alive, Chuck,
three and four.
Oh, uh, okay.
Lou, what is 43 times 101?
-4-3-4-3.
-Yes!
Yes, you're on fire. Yes!
You're ruining it, Charlie,
three and four.
Keep the time,
and three and four.
And turn.
CHARLIE: Esther,
what is five factorial?
Uh, 120.
Yeah!
All geniuses with rhythm.

(PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)
What are the words?
Uh... I haven't figured that out yet.
And, actually, the more I try,
the harder it gets.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
You know, when I can't
figure out homework stuff,
my dad says,
"If you sit in the question,
"the answer finds you."
Hmm.
And does it?
I don't know. I...
I don't sit long enough.
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
That's my problem, too.
So, do you like my dad?
I mean, he can be so annoying,
but he's also, like,
really smart and nice.
You know, your dad says
you're the best thing about him.
-That's probably true.
-(LAUGHS)
MAN: Let's put it right over here.
LOU: Whoa.
-Is all this stuff for you?
-Coach.
Is this another endorsement deal?
No.
They're donating merchandise
to Dress for Success,
which is a charity that I work with.
That's awesome.
You like?
I love.
(LAUGHS)
-No way.
-Yeah.
Can I?
KAT: Don't worry. I'll pay them back.
-Okay, come on.
-Thank you.
You got another bag in here
with some textbooks.
-Thank you.
-KAT: Are you kidding?
I love it.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
-I got to get her home.
-What?
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Already? No.
Okay.
I love Keats.
Oh...
Wha... Stop.
What are you doing?
-I killed it. (LAUGHS)
-(LAUGHS) It's not...
Listen, I'm gonna say something
that's probably gonna
come out completely wrong,
but you're beautiful
without all of that.
I mean, either way, you're...
good to go.
Good to go?
Good to go.
(LAUGHS) Okay, I'll take it.
You're a great teacher, Charlie.
Those kids, they're lucky to have you.
I don't know, hanging
with you guys today made me
feel kind of normal.
Wheels up for Puerto Rico at 7:00.
Oh, my bad.
I thought you were by yourself.
Puerto Rico.
Um, my friends, they have
a bed-and-breakfast there, so...
That's...
Listen, if... if...
If Bastian is the guy
that you think you're supposed to be with,
then, hell, I'll drive you to the airport.
But if you're not sure...
then come with me
to the fall semiformal
tomorrow night.
Yeah, they need chaperones.
Maybe you need chaperoning.
Listen, I'm not saying this as your
husband or even as your friend,
because technically
I'm not either,
but if you go back to Bastian,
aren't you just making
the same mistake
all over again... again?
Are you asking me to the school dance?
Well, I could leave a note in your locker,
but here we are in free period,
-so I figured I'd take my shot.
-(LAUGHS)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Welcome.
Excuse me. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Come on. Okay.
Can I have your left wrist?
My left wr... Okay.
Oh, my God.
How sweet.
Oh, and I also got you this to give me.
(BOTH LAUGH)
So thank you very much.
-I'm glad I thought of that.
-It's my favorite.
You look in...
You look...
Let's go to the dance.
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
Out of respect
for Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert-hyphen-Valdez,
we would like the gym
to be a photo-free zone,
so please check your phones
at the door.
You did all this for me?
I might've had a little help.
You know what, Kofi,
why don't you take the night off?
I'll let you know when I need you.
KOFI: All right. Have a good time, y'all.
Okay. All right.
Unsupervised.
I'm gonna screen-grab
your search history
and send it to your mother.
That's a guarantee.
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
-Hey.
-Hey.
-How are you?
-Good to see you.
Kill the music!
A-one, two, three, four. Hit it.
(SINGING) Marry me, marry me
Say yes
Marry me, marry me
Say yes...
What are you doing?
You know, kids opening for
pop stars is very big these days.
I've never
Seen forever...
When did the glee club
learn Marry Me?
When Charlie Gilbert
became Charlie Valdez.
-I'm hungry, Mr. Pitts.
-Keep singing!
You're an inspiration, Pitts.
Right back at you, Gilbert.
Oh, my God,
they are so adorable.
Thank you.
If you could.
...tried
Yeah, okay.
"To Jonathan Gregory Pitts,
"a fellow architect of song."
(LAUGHS) Okay, let her
breathe just a little bit.
Come on.
-Ring, ring, ring
-Ring, ring
Church bells, let 'em ring
Ring, ring...
Love and light.
-Love and light.
-Okay. Cut!
-Tonight, tonight
-Bring the music back!
Keep me satisfied...
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
So, do we have a job?
Do we have duties? What do we do?
Yes, we do. We got to monitor.
We got to guide. We got to encourage.
-Okay.
-We might have to discourage.
-(LAUGHS)
-We might have to separate.
And maybe later... Mm, dance?
I don't think you want to see that.
Oh, I do. I do want to see that.
Did you see my corsage?
I did.
Hey!
Aah!
(LAUGHING)
KAT: Oh, yeah, I want to do one.
-Ready? Okay.
-Yep.
Hold this.
What are you doing?
A private.
Hey, everybody.
This is my first semiformal,
and, uh...
I just want to thank you guys
for letting me crash.
We love you, Kat!
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you, Parker. Love you, too.
You guys mind if I do a song?
-(ALL CHEERING)
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I actually wrote this song
when I was about your age.
It was on my very first album.
It's called After Love.
You guys may not know it.
-I do!
-KAT: Oh...
Do you want to come
up here and do it with me?
(GASPS)
-You play?
-Y-yeah.
Let's do it.
(CROWD CHEERING)
Give it up for a fellow
architect of song, Mr. Pitts.
-Pitts!
-Mr. Pitts!
(TUNING)
Ready?
Three, four.
(SINGING)
Long nights in your car
Mornings in your arms
From five-hour calls
To nothing at all
I guess I missed the signs
The writing
On the wall, ooh
Don't know where
It all went wrong
But if this is how
It's got to be
I need someone to tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What comes after love?
I want to know there's
Something for me after us
I don't think my heart
Was made to break this much
Tell me there's a
Happy ever after love
Tell me there's a
Happy ever after us
I believe, I believe
I believe in love
Even if, even if
It wasn't meant for us
ALL: I believe, I believe
I believe in love
I just need someone
To tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What comes after love?
I want to know there's
Something for me after us
I don't think my heart
Was made to break this much
Tell me there's a
Happy ever after love
Tell me there's a
Happy ever after us
(ALL CHEERING)
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
KAT: Thank you guys so much!
Well, that is my new favorite song.
(KAT CHUCKLES)
What was your old favorite song?
I don't know, this might be
a little too edgy for you to handle,
but when my mom was sick,
we watched a lot of musicals,
and her favorite was Camelot.
Hmm.
You know, it was like Game of Thrones,
but less nudity and murder.
More music and velvet.
(CHUCKLES)
But, anyway, when Lancelot wants to
tell Guinevere how he feels,
instead of saying,
"I want to be with you,"
he says,
"We're gonna split up. It's inevitable."
That's a little depressing.
No, not when you hear it.
"If ever I were to leave you,
it wouldn't be in summer."
(SINGING)
If ever I would leave you
It wouldn't be in summer
Seeing you in summer
I never would go
-It's nice.
-Yeah.
Your hair streaked
With sunlight
Your lips red as flame...
-Dance with me.
-No, I don't dance.
Come on. Dance with me.
Just a little bit.
There we go.
How could it be in autumn?
How I'd leave in autumn
I never would know...
Shouldn't we be listening
to Barry White, or Drake...
or whatever it is you listen to
when you're about to, you know...
To what?
Well...
Well, I don't want to presume that I'm
about to have the best night of my life,
but if I am, I don't want
to do it to Robert Goulet.
I like it.
You do?
When you catch
The fire's glow
A lot.
If ever I would leave you
How could it be in springtime
Knowing how in spring
I'm bewitched by you so?
Oh, no
Not in springtime...
Is this smart?
I think we left smart six weeks ago.
-Morning.
-Morning.
Thank God you're here.
'Cause I did have
just a minute of...
"Is she gone? Did she leave?"
I was like, "God, just...
"I know you rock stars move fast,
"on to the next town, like, just..."
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)
-God. Here, take it.
Hey.
MEL: Hey, how was last night?
-Amazing.
-Wait. Where are you?
-Are you with, uh...
-Yeah. Charlie.
-Still?
-Still.
"Charlie. Still."
KAT: Let's just
move that to Tuesday.
-But they're expecting you.
-Sorry. Just tell 'em no.
-Okay.
-Okay.
I'll call you later.
Did I hear you just
rearranging your day for me?
Maybe.
And you're welcome.
Thank you.
You and your mom?
Yeah, at Coney Island.
KAT: The Wonder Wheel.
Well, we actually called it
"The wishing wheel."
Yeah. We loved going out there.
Although the last time
that I took her out there,
it was closed, 'cause it was winter.
It was, like, right before
she passed away.
-I'm sorry.
-No, no.
It's okay. I like talking about her.
It happened a while ago
when Lou was like five, but...
they definitely got to spend
some good times together.
And it's crazy how much
of her I see in Lou.
You think she would've liked me?
-No.
-(LAUGHS) What?
Yes, she would've loved you.
She would've thought
you were amazing.
I mean, she might have
questioned a few things.
She was very...
Well, she was very self-sufficient.
Well, I'm, like, the most
self-sufficient person on the planet.
-I mean, I do more things in one day--
-No, I know.
I know you do. I'm not saying that.
I'm saying you have a lot of people,
you know, kind of handling things.
There's nothing wrong
with having help.
I mean, it doesn't mean
I'm helpless.
It just means that I have
a lot of things on my plate.
I know, but you might not need
as many people helping you
as you think you do.
So, what are you saying?
You want me to try being alone?
Because I could go
be alone right now.
No, no, no, uh, let's be clear.
"Alone" means without help,
not alone without me.
Wait.
Is this a challenge?
Now you get it.
-What, are you challenging me?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, but let's make it
a real challenge, okay?
-Okay.
-That means without doormen.
-Without yes-Melissa.
-Fine.
Without cooks,
without cleaners,
without hair extenders.
-(LAUGHS)
-Yeah, this is serious.
Without live-feeding.
Without constant
filming updates.
Without all that
little stuff. Gone.
Okay. I can do that.
-Okay.
-What are you gonna do?
Me? I'm... You know,
I'm gonna be there.
I'm gonna monitor.
Mm-mm.
Nice try, buddy.
-Okay.
-(LAUGHS) What?
You're gonna get on social media.
-No.
-Yes.
Come on, that's... This is about you.
You're gonna go on social media.
You're gonna have Snapchat
and Instagram and TikTok.
-You're gonna do a dance! Yes!
-This is about you.
-Don't flip it.
-No, listen.
Why are you so judgmental?
It's so crazy.
No, look, this is gonna
be a great thing.
It's an amazing platform
for you as a teacher.
-(SIGHS)
-Seriously.
If you don't do it, I'm not doing it.
Okay.
CHARLIE: So, this is
your little getaway?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Nope. It's locked.
Nothing under there?
Gosh. Dang it.
-Jeff, can you...
-No, no, that's cheating.
Come on.
What are you gonna do?
You got a little problem.
Sometimes you just got
to concede. It's okay.
(SECURITY ALARM BLARING)
You really like to win.
Yes! Uh! Ha ha.
Coming?
I'm sorry I couldn't find
the wine glasses.
-It's better.
-(LAUGHS)
Living room.
Oh, this... No. Sound.
(LIGHTS CHIME)
Oh, my God.
-Jesus!
-Whose house is this?
Well, that actually could be nice
to offset the breeze
from the broken window.
-We can make s'mores.
-I like s'mores.
-Me, too.
-Yeah.
KAT: (SINGING)
What comes after love...
I am going to
make us these smoothies all by myself.
I don't think my heart
Was made to break this much
Tell me there's a
Happy ever after us...
(SCOFFS)
I think you may
have forgotten this.
Jesus, he's had an account
for 45 minutes,
and he already has
half a million followers.
-Oh, my God. Look.
-GIRL: Half a million?
Now you need
your own web page.
Already created it on Wix.com.
"Numbers Neva Lie."
-Oh, that's perfect.
-That is a good one.
-I love that. Do you love that?
-Yeah, I do like it.
So, what do you want
your caption to be, Mr. G?
KAT: "If you sit in the question,
"the answer will find you."
(PHONE BEEPS)
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Sorry, I was checking out
this guy on Instagram.
Oh, should I be jealous?
He sounds very
interesting and handsome.
Just posting about
all this math stuff.
(GROANS) One of those.
Brought you an apple.
Happy birthday, part one.
Thank you.
Yeah, on my last birthday,
I was at a math conference
in the Poconos.
-Oh! I have a lot to live up to.
-Yes.
-Open it!
-Okay.
Like, a handkerchief or...
Turn around.
Oh, it's a blindfold.
(KAT LAUGHS)
I'm a little taken aback.
I, uh, didn't know
this was your thing,
-but whatever you're... into.
-Shh.
KAT: Okay, straight ahead.
CHARLIE: Okay.
I got to say, I'm getting excited.
-You should be.
-Okay.
Wait, turn around.
It's not a pinata.
Maybe. Okay.
That's it, right there.
-That's where I need you.
-Yeah.
-You ready?
-Okay.
(MACHINES WHIRRING)
Happy birthday.
No!
How?
I know a guy who knows a guy.
Come on.
CHARLIE: Okay, so
we're on the wishing wheel.
KAT: Yes.
CHARLIE: Go ahead.
'Kay, done. Your turn. Make a wish.
I already got it.
(KAT SINGING)
Since you came around
You're testing my faith
I'm praying out loud
Yeah.
I feel it in my chest...
-21!
-Yes!
-Yeah!
-Hey.
Come on. Okay. Sorry.
Great day, you guys.
We are finished. Grab your stuff.
-I'm ready.
-You are. You're gonna be great.
-BOY 1: Yo, is that Bastian?
-Amazing.
LOU: Thanks.
BASTIAN: What's up, kids?
-(CHILDREN CHATTERING)
-BOY 2: Oh, my God, Bastian!
Wait, what's going on?
He insisted on coming.
Hey, come on, now.
Your parents are waiting for you outside.
Okay. See you later, guys. See you. Bye.
I tried to give you a heads-up,
but somebody wasn't
answering her phone.
No, no. There are
no phones at school.
-What are you guys doing here?
-You got nominated
for Best Pop Vocal Performance
at the Grammys.
-What?
-Marry Me... (SPEAKS SPANISH)
-Oh, my God!
-We got nominated!
-Can you believe it?
-COLLINS: Congratulations.
-Oh, my God, yes!
-Congratulations.
Yes. Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.
It was only a matter of time, babe.
-Oh, my God.
-You should tell her.
Oh, yeah.
So, um, Bastian's concert
at Madison Square Garden
on Friday is streaming
across multiple platforms,
so there's loads of exposure.
Yeah, he thought we could surprise
everyone and do Marry Me.
COLLIN: Right.
Now, the ballots are out next week,
and nobody's seen you two
together since...
well, you know, a while.
Um...
You know, we don't have any
-of the dancers in town.
-No, no, no.
It's short notice. I don't...
No, but wait.
But we can do the ballad version.
The one that we wanted
to release after the ceremony.
I don't know, Sebastian.
"Sebastian"?
Come on. "Sebastian"?
That's his real name.
Look, can I just...
I know this is a little...
I'm not trying to make a thing here,
but this is the song that
you were gonna get married to.
This is huge for me.
Totally. Totally.
You should come. I want you to come.
Are you gonna come with us?
Right. Okay. I mean, it's...
it's not a big deal.
The nomination is.
So please don't be upset.
Uh, I'm just being a jerk.
And I'm sorry.
I just want you to remember
award shows are bullshit
and you don't need them
to tell you how good you are.
I know.
Just do me a favor.
Don't say "Sebastian."
(DOOR OPENS)
See you, babe.
-See you soon.
-Hey.
We got to schedule
a band rehearsal
-and a wardrobe fitting.
-Okay.
-Now?
-Yes, now.
-Yes.
-Okay. You good?
-I'm good.
-Are you sure?
Okay, I'll call you.
MEL: This is gonna
be so exciting!
Hey.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
Just keeping Tank company.
Good dog.
You're afraid she'll fall
back in love with Bastian and dump you?
No.
Yeah.
I'd be afraid of that, too.
(CROWD CHEERING)
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Um...
I have a little surprise for you tonight.
There is a woman
who's been my heart...
and my biggest inspiration.
{\an8}(SPEAKING SPANISH)
She always gonna be my family.
And we're always gonna have...

BASTIAN: Yeah. Pose.
MEL: We did it.
We look so good!
You guys' chemistry is off the charts.
BASTIAN: Come on, guys. Let's do it.
WOMAN: And
the audience felt it.
(LAUGHTER AND CHEERING)
(BASTIAN SINGING IN SPANISH)
-You know?
-Yeah.
-Hey.
-Oh, my God.
-I didn't know you were coming.
-Hey.
No, I wasn't, and then I was like,
"I'm gonna get down there," and...
but I didn't have a pass,
so I couldn't get in at first,
and then luckily,
someone saw me
and they brought me backstage
and then brought me over here.
So, you didn't see it?
No, no, I did. I did. Yeah.
Well... Did you like it?
(STUTTERING) I thought it was amazing.
I was really happy for you.
I think you're amazing.
Can you guys...
You know, fine, we'll go over here.
Yeah.
(SINGING IN SPANISH)
It was great. It was...
Social media is exploding.
It's, uh... They're even saying
you guys are back together.
Well, if social media says
it's true, it must be true.
Wait, are you okay?
Yeah, no, I'm good.
I'm good. I'm just...
I'm looking at you here,
and it... It all worked out.
I mean, no one even
remembers the meltdown.
I know. It's crazy, right?
I'm really happy for you.
You deserve it.
You really do.
(SINGING IN SPANISH)
God, he can sing.
Dame un segundo
Un segundo chance...
"Segundo chance."
What is that? Second chances?
It's just a song.
Maybe.
Maybe it's something more.
What's going on?
Look, I know this is a big deal,
and that's why
I wanted to come down here,
but I don't fit.
And I think that's
objectively pretty true.
-And we don't need to--
-So, what are you saying?
Look, if I'm being honest with myself,
I really came down here
just to say that this...
I don't think this works.
(CROWD CHEERING)
BASTIAN: Can I have a bottle
of Hennessy X.O? Yeah?
Are you breaking up with me?
BASTIAN: Katarina. Kat.
Kat, come here.
-Come here.
-It's okay. Go.
-Go.
-No.
-Come here.
-What are you saying?
-Tell me what you... What do you mean?
-Everybody's calling you.
It's nothing.
Talk later.
-Go. Go.
-BASTIAN: Come here, baby.
CHARLIE: It's fine. Keep going.
-Come on.
-(ALL CHEERING) Kat!

COLIN: Come on, Charlie. Don't be stupid.
Well, it's a little late for that.
-You got another one.
-Take it, please.
It's made out to the school.
It just feels a little unseemly.
-I didn't do it for the money.
-I know,
but if you don't take the check,
then the prenup's not binding.
You could sell your story.
You could write a book.
(SCOFFS)
Is that what you think of me?
Oh, come on, Charlie.
I was rooting for you.
I wanted it to work.
The whole world wanted it to.
I'm sorry to disappoint
you and the world.
You're disappointing yourself.
I'm protecting myself.
I can't get away from her.
There's always a poster,
a Vitamix or a billboard.
You know they're not together?
Maybe not.
But, Colin, can you do me a favor?
Will you be there for her
when she figures it all out?
She's gonna need someone.

-BASTIAN: Nice.
-(CROWD CHEERING)
FALLON:
So, we've been... we've been
beating around the bush,
and I think that
we should get right down to it.
I mean, we all know
that you guys are not "together,"
uh, yet you wrote
Marry Me for each other.
Uh, Bastian wrote Segundo for Kat.
Kat wrote On My Way for Bastian.
I'd say the next song
should probably be, uh,
Come On Already! Am I right?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Let's see if we can
get these two guys
to sing a little romantic duet
when we come back. Ooh.
Do not change that channel.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
I didn't write
On My Way for Bastian.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
I know it's an inopportune time
to have an epiphany, but...
I don't want to go back.
Someone told me that if you sit
in the question long enough,
the answer finds you.
And the answer is...
I don't want to keep making the same
mistakes over and over.
I want something different.
-Come here.
-(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING)
So, I'm guessing
no romantic duet.
REPORTER 1: Hey.
REPORTER 2: Kat!
-That's Kat Valdez.
-Kat! Kat, wait!
Where you going?
REPORTER 3:
Kat, hey! How about a shot, huh?
Peoria.
-I'll get you a plane.
-No.
I want to do this by myself, okay?
-Can't be that hard.
-REPORTER 4: Kat, come on.
-REPORTER 1: Kat, where you headed?
-How about another shot?
Take me to the airport.
Bye!
-REPORTER 2: Hey.
-That's not our car.
Whoa. Is that Kat Valdez?
Oh, my God.
Kat Valdez?
MAN: You're right.
What's she doing here?
Sorry. The last
connecting flight to Peoria
is through Chicago,
but it's all sold out.
-(SIGHS)
-If you fly tomorrow...
Tonight. It has to be tonight.
The Mathalon will be over
by noon tomorrow,
and I promised I'd be there.
I will give anyone
$5,000 for their standby slot to Chicago.
It's illegal.
You can't buy someone else's ticket.
-You can't?
-Kat.
Did you know
it's illegal to buy someone else's ticket?
Uh, yeah. Everyone does.
Now, I can't get you a plane,
but we got you the last
available ticket.
It's in coach.
-You're a lifesaver.
-Yeah.
Tell me that after
you get there, okay?
So, there's your passport
and some money.
Go find your answer.
-Okay.
-Go on.
Bye.
PILOT: Ladies and gentlemen,
due to freezing weather conditions
and some strong headwinds,
we will be in flight
a little longer than usual,
but we will get you there
by morning.
Excuse me, miss.
I'd like to buy
champagne and caviar for the whole flight.
I'm sorry. We only have ham wraps,
cheese cubes
and Michelob ULTRA.
Okay, well, then ham wraps
and Michelob ULTRA.
MAN: What about
the cheese cubes?
Sure. Cheese cubes, too.
Why not?
Um, also, who wants to sell me
a very heavy winter coat?
Uh, the answer is nine?
-(BELL DINGING)
-JUDGE: That answer is correct.
This round goes
to the Coolidge Pi-thons.
Nice, Esther. Good job.
-Go, Esther!
-(CHEERING)
Where are the people
with the cars?
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a phone charger?
-I-I need...
-No. Sorry.
-PARKER: I do.
-You...
Colin called me, so...
Is Charlie here?
You know, I didn't
tell him I was coming.
I didn't want to screw
with him on the big day, in case...
You know, he's not good
with the back-and-forth,
so I got to ask you, Kat, are you...
Is this for real?
Well, I walked out on Fallon to freeze
my toes off in Peoria, so...
Excellent point.
I called an Uber.
-Forty-seven minutes?
-What?
We're not gonna make it.
Didn't they already start?
Should we hitch a ride?
I don't know what...
Wait!
{\an8}(BRAKES SCREECH)
This woman,
this superstar, this icon,
has flown in coach in stilettos
to win back the unlikely
love of her life,
who, against all odds, she loves.
And he loves her.
He does, right?
Completely.
The next thing you say
will forecast not just their future,
but the future
of-of anyone whoever believed
in the magic of a leap of faith.
-Look...
-She'll give you a thousand dollars.
The answer is 15.
The answer is correct.
-Five points, Trinity Numerators.
-Yes!
Yes! Get 'em!
Congratulations.
After a break, we're moving
to a sudden-death round
between
the three-time champions,
-Trinity Numerators...
-ALL: Yes!
...and the first-time finalists,
Coolidge Pi-thons.
-Sudden death.
-Ooh, blast off.
First up, Lou Gilbert
for the Coolidge Pi-thons.
Choker better pray.
-(LAUGHING)
-Shut up.
(LAUGHING)
You laughing at that?
Look...
I don't want to embarrass you.
I know that's your daughter.
CHARLIE: Yeah?
MANNY: I saw her last year.
She's got stage fright.
My daughter's fine.
Look, I just think maybe
it would be easier on you
if you guys just conceded the title.
-Concede?
-Mm-hmm.
-Give you the trophy?
-No.
It's more like you save
yourself from humiliation.
Huh?
Okay, huddle up. Here we go.
So, uh, Coach Looney Tunes
over there wants to know
if we just want to concede
and give him the trophy.
-ALL: No!
-That doesn't even make sense.
-CHARLIE: Yeah.
-Four in a row, baby.
How about we go
show him what the Pi-thons are all about?
ALL: Yeah!
(ALL HISSING)
Lou, you ready for this?
Watch me.
JUDGE: This next answer will determine
whether the Coolidge Pi-thons
win the Mathalon.
Lou Gilbert.
-Yes, Lou.
-Go, Lou!
(CHEERING)
-Come on, Lou.
-You got this.
-Come on, Lou. You got this.
-GIRL: Come on, Lou.
JUDGE: A circle with perimeter eight pi
is inscribed in an ellipse
whose width is twice its height.
What is the area
of the ellipse in square units?
GIRL: Okay. All right, all right.
You know this. Set your mind to it.
(BOY 1 WHISPERS) She's got it.
BOY 2: Yeah, she...
(IMITATES GAGGING)
Anyone know a good choke?
-Hey.
-JUDGE: Quiet, please.
Please respect the Mathalonians.
GIRL: It's not fair.
BOY: Loser!
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
I tried to protect you from this.
Stop it.
GIRL: Stay with us, Lou.
(MOUTHING)
GIRL: Don't let it get in your head!
CHARLIE: Lou.
What the hell is this?
-(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
-Oh, my God.
You guys, it's over here!
BOY 1: Dork!
BOY 2: Yeah, Mr. Gilbert. Good idea.
GIRL 1: Yeah, that's it, Mr. Gilbert.
CHARLIE: Yeah.
You got it.
Come on!
(CHILDREN CHATTERING
AND LAUGHING)
Come on. Objection. He's counting.
He's dancing, you lunatic.
That's Kat Valdez.
Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna die.
CHARLIE: Come on. Come on.
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)
GIRL: I believe in you!
32 pi!
-The answer is correct.
-(CHEERING) Yes!
JUDGE: But the timer's elapsed.
The Trinity Numerators retain
their national status.
We'll reconvene in ten minutes
for the awards presentation.
GIRL: Hey, it's okay, Lou.
(CHANTING)
Four years in a row! Four years in a row!
Hey. Hey!
I'm so proud of you.
-Dad, I lost again.
-No, it doesn't matter.
First of all, you got it right.
It was perfect.
But second of all,
you were just up there.
You stood up there,
and you were so brave.
I'm the one who should be crying
for the dancing I was doing.
-(LAUGHS)
-You were great.
Thank you.
I love you, Dad.
You were amazing, Lou.
Really, I mean,
you took a shot
even though it was scary.
That's what matters.
Not everything adds up
the way you think it will.
You know, they say
if you want something different,
you have to do something different.
What if we're just too different?
What if we're not?
(CROWD GASPING)
{\an8}(ALL CHUCKLE)
{\an8}(MOUTHING)
{\an8}I'm fully blacking out right now.
GIRL: Come on, Mr. G.
BOY 1: Come on, Mr. G!
BOY 2: You're leaving her hanging.
Come on, dude.
Dad.
(BOTH CRYING)
ALL: Aww.
ALL: Ew.
CHARLIE: Here we go.

-Slower. Okay.
-He doesn't...
{\an8}Diamonds and a necklace

{\an8}Good boy.
{\an8}Now he wanna bet
He can beat me to the bed...
So, we met
at Jimmy Fallon, didn't we?
-Yeah.
-We didn't hook up at Fallon.
No, we had sex at Burning Man.
So, Kat made me come
to one of those, um...
What are they called again, babe?
-It's called a Mathalon, bro.
-Yes!
Oh, my God, it's so boring.
And what do you guys
do there again?
-It's this thing called, um...
-Math.
-Yes! Oh, my God.
-Mm-hm. Yep.
{\an8}I fell asleep just even
thinking about it, but...
{\an8}She did.
{\an8}I met my most favorite person here.
We met at a party
as she was leaving.
And had I walked out ten seconds earlier,
we never would've met.
And I bet you wish
that was the case sometimes.
(LAUGHS) Never.
I had a six-mile radius set,
and she definitely
lived more than six miles away.
Well, she wanted
to meet at 4:00 p.m.
Who meets at 4:00 p.m.?
When we met, he was in a unitard.
She liked what she saw.
(LAUGHS)
Eighty-one years ago,
we were born in the same hospital
two days apart, in diapers.
Here it is 81 years later,
and we're back in diapers again.
Oh, Charlie! (LAUGHS)
We met on a dating app, but then,
uh, he invited me on the second date,
um, camping in the woods,
and I was like,
"That seems unsafe...
-"so I'll go."
-Her friend told her not to go.
Yeah, but she did,
and it's been five years,
-and she's still alive.
-(BOTH LAUGH)
BOTH: We met at a concert.
(SINGING)
Spotlight on you got me zoomin'
I'm falling into you
We're dancing on tabletops
Neighbors calling the cops
When I'm with you
Feels like
Nobody's watching us
We're burning down
All the clocks
Hoping that time will stop
Block out
The world tonight
Like nobody's watching us
Nobody's watching us
No, nobody's watching
So come touch my body
No, nobody's watching us
Nobody's watching us
No, nobody's watching
So come touch my body
No, nobody's watching us
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Right here by the light
Of the moon
Spotlight on you
Got me zoomin'
I'm falling into you
We're dancing on tabletops
Neighbors calling the cops
When I'm with you
Feels like
Nobody's watching us
We're burning down
All the clocks
Hoping that time will stop
Block out
The world tonight
Like nobody's watching us
Nobody's watching us
No, nobody's watching
So come touch my body
No, nobody's watching us
-No, no, no, no, no
-No-no-no, no-no
No, nobody's watching
So come touch my body
No, nobody's watching us
Na, na, na

Got ocean views from ceiling to the floor
Keep a milli by the bed
A hundred more offshore
Closets full of Louis
And Christian Dior
Picassos and van Goghs
That no one's seen before
Diamonds drippin' down
Like fountains
I'll sign, don't care
What the amount is
Every day and night
Live a life filled with luxury
Don't matter when
You're not with me
Yeah, yeah

To put all my money just

We're riding out to Puerto Rico
Later we get the yacht
Head to Santo Domingo
And my body, papi
Es tu party
Now I'm flying
You be the pilot
No questioning
Our love, make my Best days even better
Long ain't long enough
I'm looking at forever
