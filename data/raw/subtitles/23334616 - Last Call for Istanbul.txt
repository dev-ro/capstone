There's nobody there, actually,
but it's fine.
[man 1] Thank you very much.
[music continues in headphones]
[sighs]
[phone ringing]
[woman over PA] Miss Lily,
please come to the Lost and Found.
Miss Lily, please come
to the Lost and Found.
[whimsical music playing]
[man 1] When I first saw her,
I felt uneasy.
I was stunned.
Then I heard a voice say to me,
"Mehmet, don't look any further."
"She's the one for you."
If she hadn't come into my life,
I'm sure I'd be someplace else right now.
[woman 1] Oh no! Come on!
Fuck.
Excuse me.
Can you help me, please?
[man 2] What's up?
Uh, it's the exact same suitcase,
but it's not mine.
You sure? You checked it?
- Yeah, Yeah. I'm sure of it.
- And looked all over the belt?
Yeah, yeah.
87-36. Is everything out on the belt?
Affirmative.
Everything has been loaded off.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- That's all of it.
- That's it? Ugh!
[Mehmet] Uh, excuse me.
- Um, are you looking for your luggage?
- [woman 1] Yes.
I think somebody took it.
[man 2] See? There you go.
We got it all out here.
You need to check with Lost and Found.
- It's right over there. Head over there.
- For God's sake.
Someone just took my bags and left.
- [woman 2] Ugh!
- You're from Turkey, aren't you?
[sighs]
Okay, I don't mean to disturb you,
but, well... [chuckles]
...I was just going through security,
and I noticed someone
with a similar suitcase.
If I had known it was yours,
I would've tried to catch the person.
It's fine. No worries.
It's not your fault.
I just hope that I'll find that suitcase.
Otherwise, I'm totally screwed.
It's all right.
I'm sure whoever grabbed it
will eventually realize their mistake.
Well, don't you have your phone number...
[phone ringing]
...or address on it?
That'd help.
I left my cell phone and wallet in it.
Uh...
Have you looked at the tag
on this suitcase here?
[woman 1] Yeah.
- But I can't read it.
- [Mehmet] Let me have a look.
Chris.
Christopher... Louis.
Thank you for your help.
You're very welcome.
We'll find it. Don't worry about it.
[phone line ringing]
It's ringing. Here.
[phone line ringing]
[woman 2] Hello.
- Thank you for calling Dragon Gift Shop.
- Hello?
[woman 2 continues in Cantonese]
[in English] Dragon Gift Shop?
Answering machine.
I heard "Dragon Gift Shop,"
then it switched to Cantonese.
Not sure that's it.
It's a shop near Chinatown in Manhattan.
How am I supposed to go to Chinatown?
Actually, this is where I'm headed.
Right by that shop.
[whimsical music playing]
Well, I'm going somewhere close by.
If you want, I can give you a ride.
You're going to Chinatown?
Or are you trying to be helpful?
What difference
does that really make right now?
[sighs] Well, you've already spent hours
in the air. Thank you though.
- I'll manage somehow.
- Honestly, it's not a big deal.
I'll drop you off there
and then leave you to work it out.
It's no problem at all.
[woman 1] I felt as though
I already knew him when I first saw him.
I bet you're wondering
how you got into this. Am I right?
Not at all. Because this has happened
to me several times before.
[woman 1] You know how sometimes
people just know when they've met someone
they'll have a relationship with?
That's how I felt.
[Mehmet] Let's go.
[woman 1] I often wonder
what my life would be like
if I hadn't met him that day.
If I hadn't gone with him.

[music stops]
[woman 1] This place
is quite familiar to me.
I feel as if I've been here before.
I'm guessing it's because
I've seen it in a few hundred movies.
[Mehmet] That's to be expected
after watching so many American movies.
- Here it is.
- [woman 1] It's here?
[woman in Mandarin]
You can try this for a sore throat.
It's very effective. You will see
the prices are all shown there.
[in English] Hello.
Uh, does this suitcase belong to you?
- Yes.
- [Mehmet] There you go.
Yes. My husband's luggage.
[in Mandarin] Thank God you returned it.
- [in English] Hold on.
- No! No. Wait, wait, wait.
Um, your husband has her luggage.
Where is he?
Uh...
Fenghua!
[Fenghua in Mandarin] What?
What are they saying?
[in English] Hi.
Uh, your husband has our luggage.
I mean, the same color.
He got it from the airport.
Where is he? Do you understand?
[in Mandarin] Call Dad.
They want their luggage.
Oh.
- [in English] It's your father?
- [in Mandarin] Yeah.
- Call your father.
- Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
Okay, thank you.
[in Mandarin] Hello?
Somebody brought your suitcase here.
Where are you?
Okay. Where? Okay. Bye.
[in English] Marshall City Hotel.
My husband there.
- Your luggage there.
- Okay.
[Mehmet sighs]
What happens now?
We'll go to the hotel. That's it.
No. I've bothered you enough.
I'll handle it. Alone.
We've come all this way.
I won't leave you until we find your bag.
- I promise I don't mind.
- [sighs]
[Mehmet] I'm just starving.
Let's go get some food.
Let's go.
[whimsical music playing]
- [man] Here you go.
- Thank you.
- [Mehmet] Hi.
- Hello. One pretzel, one hot dog, please.
You're welcome to put it on my bill.
Oh, so that's what it is.
You lost your luggage on purpose.
A good way
to finance your New York trip. Sorry.
That's right. Uh-huh.
I actually traveled to New York City
to fool strangers
into chasing after my luggage.
I don't think you need to trick anyone
into doing anything
'cause there are a million guys here
who would buy you food.
Is this a compliment?
Definitely not. Not at all.
Are you flirting with me?
No, not at all. Because I'm a married man.
Okay. Good.
I'm glad there was no misunderstanding.
I'm also married.
[Mehmet] Okay. Perfect, then.

[woman] Welcome
to the Marshall City Hotel.
How can I help you?
- [Mehmet sighs]
- Hello!
Uh, we are looking for Mr. Chang.
Is he here,
or did he leave
a suitcase similar to this one?
Oh, Chang! He just called.
He said he'll come tomorrow morning
with your suitcase.
Tomorrow? Oh, come on!
Can you call him again?
Because we need that suitcase now.
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I don't have his number.
Okay, um, could you please keep this?
But please don't give it to him
unless he brings mine.
Certainly. Certainly.
[sighs]
And can I get a room, please?
- Oh, of course, dear!
- [Mehmet] Hmm?
You're staying here?
I don't have any other choice, do I?
I mean, we could have stayed
somewhere else for the night.
I'll give you my most romantic room
where Marilyn Monroe
and Arthur Miller once stayed.
- No way.
- Passport, please.
Here.
John Lennon?
Oh! What a mensch.
Thank you.
- Pleasure.
- Okay. Thank you.
Course.
Thank you for everything.
- You're free to go.
- Yeah, it's time to say goodbye.
Yeah, you should go to your friend's.
I've kept you long enough.
No worries. I've had a great time.
I really have, so thank you too.
Okay.
Have fun in New York.
You too. Thanks.
And good luck with your job interview.
[woman 1] Thank you.
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.
Uh, can I borrow your phone again...
And what if he doesn't bring your luggage
tomorrow morning? What then?
[woman 1] I don't know.
What shall we do?
[Mehmet sighs]
Excuse me?
[woman] Yes?
Can I ask for another room, please?
Oh great!
So John's room
for this gorgeous young guy.
Thank you.
[woman 1] Are you sure?
Passport, please.
Well, after traveling
all the way to this hotel,
I might as well stay in the room
that John Lennon stayed in.
[woman] Thank you.
Thank you.
My name is Rose.
Oh, may I highly recommend
our rooftop jazz bar?
- Yeah.
- FYI, it's the best in the Big Apple.
Okay. Thank you, Rose.
- [Rose] Pleasure.
- [Mehmet] Thanks.
[Mehmet] I'll have a drink upstairs.
She highly recommended we should go.
Would you like to join me perhaps?
No, thank you. It's best if I don't.
Why not?
I just need to get some rest.
Something wrong?
Well, it's just drinking together
on a rooftop in New York...
[Mehmet] So what?
[woman 1 chuckles]
I don't think we can do this.
I really don't understand
what the problem is.
We'll just have drinks.
[elevator beeps]
[elevator doors open]
[indistinct automated female voice]
Let's say I joined you on the rooftop.
What would your wife say?
What would she say?
Do you think this is a situation
in which my wife should intervene?
Perhaps. You tell me.
Um, no way.
It's not.
[Mehmet scoffs]
[elevator chimes]
On this matter, please know
that I'm not the kind of man
who would cheat on his wife.
You said that confidently.
Actually, I'm not being confident.
I just know myself.
I'll just go to the rooftop
to have a drink.
If you wanna join me, you're welcome to.
Honestly, I have no other plans.
I understand that you don't.
Maybe I have another agenda.

are you drinking water?
Uh, no, I was waiting for you.
Had I known you were gonna be dressed up,
I would have dressed up as well.
Where'd you get these anyway?
The basement.
That woman's awesome.
She's turned the lost and found
into a store down there,
and she has a great collection.
[Mehmet] Great.
You do look more relaxed.
I'll feel even better
if I have something to drink.
- All right. Sure.
- Hi.
[bartender] Hey there.
Wow, looking like a rock star!
Oh, thank you very much.
- And you have very nice hair.
- Why, thank you.
So what can I get you?
Um, you have any suggestions?
Yeah, our margaritas are killer.

And you, sir, what would you like?
- Beer, please.
- [bartender] Beer.
Draft or bottle?
- Bottle.
- Bottle.
[laughter]
- [bartender] Here you go.
- [Mehmet] Thanks, man.
[bartender] Welcome.
[Mehmet] So what exactly do you design?
- I started out by designing jewelry.
- Uh-huh.
But now, I design hair accessories
and, more recently,
bridal hair accessories too.
I previously collaborated
with a brand in Milan
and another in London.
And now I'm here. We'll see what happens.
So you must be quite good at it.
Although, I don't
really understand that stuff.
[bartender] Here you go. Enjoy.
Thank you.
[woman 1] Um, cheers.
I feel like calling you Ryan
for some reason.
Ryan?
Okay. It's fine. Cool.
And what should I call you, then?
Hmm...
Samantha.
Samantha?
Cheers, Ryan.
Cheers, Samantha.
[woman 1] Ryan, shall we make a deal.
We'll be together
until I get my luggage tomorrow.
But after that, no phone calls,
meetings, or online stalking is allowed.
Why are we doing this?
We'll have more fun and be relaxed.
Otherwise, we're going to be
thinking too much about this.
Am I right?
You're a pretty interesting woman,
you know?
- Sorry.
- Hmm.
MEHMET, MAY I CALL YOU?
I AM NOT AVAILABLE.
Being without my phone
has been good for me.
Recommend it.
That's a deal.
[inhales deeply]
Well...
Nice to meet you, Ryan.
Nice to meet you,
Samantha.
[jazz music playing]
[woman 1] I've been married
for ten years. You?
We've, uh...
been together since we were in college.
Do you have kids?
No children.
Not yet.
Uh...
But I'd like to have children one day.
I wanna be a father.
How about you?
Maybe I'm not ready yet.
I mean, we're barely getting by.
So having kids, I don't know...
I still have things I wanna achieve.
[Mehmet] Hmm.
If your husband agrees with that,
it's okay, I guess.
I'm not sure
we're on the same page anymore.
Do you ever struggle to tell
if there's still love between you two
after being together for so long
or to tell if you've just become
accustomed to each other?
Never.
If you can't tell if it's habit or love,
then you're in trouble.
[Samantha] Why?
Well, I mean,
a person who really loves someone
never wonders about such things, you know?
In a relationship, you shouldn't
have to answer so many questions.
That's my opinion.
[Samantha] I think it's necessary.
A relationship shouldn't be
taken for granted.
So, uh, you've never felt bored of being
with the same woman?
[Mehmet] Never.
You serious?
[chuckles]
Well, you,
it's obvious you're pretty bored.
That's why you've come to New York alone.
To be creative,
I need to get out of my routine.
Know what I mean by that?
I need a complete change of scenery
and to meet strangers.
Maybe I need
to remember
that I do have other options in life.
Why'd you come alone?
Actually, I needed
to get my mind off things.
I thought it would do me good.
Let's blow off some steam.
Yeah. Absolutely. Cheers to that.
Cheers.
Now we're talking.
[Mehmet chuckles]
[sighs]
I think loyalty is overrated.
- [Mehmet] You think so?
- Hmm.
Haven't you ever cheated on your wife?
[Mehmet] No, I haven't.
Come on, Ryan. Pour your heart out.
I mean, you won't see me again anyway.
You're safe.
[crowd cheering]
[music stops]
[romantic music playing]
You didn't answer my question.
I answered your question,
but you refused to accept it.
Uh...
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.
I wouldn't have gotten married
if I wanted to cheat on my wife.
If I ever felt like cheating,
I would get divorced right away.
It's obvious that if you're happy,
love your spouse,
and have respect for them,
then it's impossible to cheat.
Mmm. What else?
There's nothing else.
What?
Don't you have any more
of these stock phrases?
"Cheaters aren't in love."
"People in love don't do that."
Take them out of your pocket
so we can start talking honestly.
[Mehmet] Why would I lie to you though?
This is exactly my point.
Don't be so uptight. Just tell the truth.
Okay, sure. Theoretically,
nobody gets married to cheat.
But occasionally,
you can get tired of your job,
life, where you live,
and also the clothes you wear.
[sighs] I think we fool ourselves,
and this is why
our relationships don't work.
Actually, if we could truly feel free
within the relationship,
then I guess
we wouldn't feel the urge to cheat.
Relationships shouldn't be
viewed as a prison.
Maybe marriage isn't to blame
for everything that goes wrong in life.
Right?
What do you think?
Maybe it's easier for us
to put the blame on others.
Especially if you're not in love with
the person who shares your life anymore
and can't even
admit the truth to yourself.
Life isn't long enough
to live in a loveless relationship, Ryan.
[funk music playing]
[sighs]
[sighs]
Samantha, do you smoke?
Sometimes. When I drink.
I actually quit.
Yeah, okay.
They put the bar in the wrong place.
The real view is right here.
[Mehmet chuckles] Yeah.
Yeah.

Would you like
to perform on stage with us?
No, thanks.
That's your profession, you know.
[Mehmet] All right. Fair enough.
So I used to watch movies
on Sunday nights.
Then, when I got in bed,
I would dream of New York.
I'd look at the ceiling, telling myself
that I'd go there when I grew up.
This view used to look so lively to me.
I used to dream the same about Istanbul.
Go there when I grow up, settle in,
and stay there for my music.
The view of the Bosporus
is far superior to this one.
I love Istanbul.
[Samantha] That's okay.
You can love Istanbul and New York.
You should give it a try.
I have, but all I can think about
are the urine-stench streets.
It's, like, everywhere.
And it seems like people are lonely.

Those girls were really hot.
How come they thought
I was invading their territory?
I mean, I know why.
When they saw your beauty,
they were threatened.
Uh...
They were intimidated.
Therefore, I thought it was only natural,
um, that, you know,
they decided to retaliate
by fighting back.
Because you're absolutely gorgeous.

[Samantha] Oh my God.
Here come the compliments!
You're going wild, Ryan.
[Mehmet] Yeah.
Is it the adrenaline or the weed?
I'd say both. Yeah, that's it.

if he doesn't know what an orgasm is?
- I know.
- [woman] An orgasm contest.
- Over there?
- Right over there, yes.
You got to take care of her.
[woman moans] Oh my God.
[woman moaning]
[Samantha] Holy shit. [laughs]
[Mehmet] I can't believe you.
[woman moaning]
[crowd cheering]
[host] Yeah! Let's go!
[Samantha laughing]
I'm going to the restroom. Be right back.
All right.
[host] Now for our next contestant.
Let's hear it for Mimi!
[crowd cheering]
Excuse me, man. Can I get a beer, please?
[bartender] Uh, yes.
- [Mehmet] Got ya.
- [Mimi chuckles]
- [sexy music playing]
- [laughs]
[Mimi moaning]
[moaning continues]
[laughing]
- [host] Oh...
- [crowd cheering]
- Oh my God!
- [bartender] It's a crazy crowd tonight.
Probably never seen something like this.
This is ridiculous.
[laugh]
And now, we have a last-minute contestant.
Want a drink?
She came all the way from Turkey
just to be in this contest.
[crowd exclaiming]
[host] Here's Samantha!
You're joking.
You're not gonna do it, right?
- Why did we come here?
- No, let's leave.
- I thought we're just watching.
- Okay, just watch.
[crowd cheering]
[exhales]
[sexy music playing]
[moans]
[moaning intensifies]
[moaning continues]
[moaning intensifies]
[crowd cheering]
[host] Oh my God!
Oh my God!
[host] Whoo!
[Mehmet] So you really, uh...
I mean, are you really, like, um...
Ryan, what's with the long face?
What's wrong? Won't you congratulate me?
What long face?
I was just wondering if you were
faking like that with your husband too.
Who said I was faking it, Ryan?
[laugh] The night is young.
- [man 2] Did you win?
- [Samantha] Yes!
[man 2] Awesome! Do you want to jump on?
[Samantha] Yes! Sure.
Let's get a jump shot.
[laugh] Okay. How do we do it?
[electronic dance music playing]
Okay. So I want to see a hair-toss.
I want to see you
blowing kisses to the camera.
Pointing to the camera.
Come on. Energy, okay?
[Samantha] Okay.
{\an8}Here we go.
{\an8}[electronic dance music continues]
[electronic dance music continues]
- [elevator dings]
- [Mehmet sighs]
[chuckles]
[elevator dings]
[chuckles]
I had so much fun. Thanks a lot.
Good night.
[gasps]
[elevator dings]
[Samantha laughs]
[both laugh]
[sexy music playing]
[breathing heavily]
[Mehmet moans]
[breathing heavily]
[both moaning]
[alarm ringing]
[Samantha grunts]
[Mehmet groans]
Serin?
Serin? What happened?
The game's over.
[emotional music playing]
[Mehmet] Serin?
- Serin?
- [bellboy] Sir.
Hello, sir.
Sir? Your wife's suitcase has arrived.
What? Uh, okay, sir.
Thanks. Okay, bye. Thank you.
[sighs]
[exhales]
[phone line ringing]
- Eda, what's up?
- [Eda] Hi, Mehmet.
Sorry, I guess I got the time wrong.
Did I call too early?
It's fine. Is something wrong?
I was gonna call you yesterday,
but you texted that you weren't available.
Anyway, I just wanted to inform you
about the hearing date.
On the 20th next month
at 11:30 a.m. in Çağlayan.
I just told Mehmet too.
Due to the mutual consent,
a witness isn't needed.
- It should take you 15 minutes at most.
- Very well. Thank you.
[sighs]
[emotional music playing]
[Serin] I felt as though
I already knew him when I first saw him.
You know how sometimes
people just know when they've met someone
they'll have a relationship with?
That was how I felt.
[Mehmet] I was stunned
the second I saw her.
Something deep within me drew me to her.
She even had a boyfriend at that time.
But I didn't care.
I asked her to go with me.
[Serin] I broke up with my boyfriend
and set off with Mehmet,
leaving everything behind
and relying on no one, not even myself.
That night, we went to his house
and haven't been apart since.
[laughing]
I often wonder what my life would be like
if I hadn't met him that day.
If I hadn't gone with him.
[Mehmet] I often wonder...
what kind of man I would be
if she hadn't been in my life.
And I consider myself really fortunate
to have her in my life.
[Serin] The third year
of our relationship or so,
I was admitted to a college in New York.
Fashion Design.
I would have loved to go,
but everything
was going so well with Mehmet.
[Mehmet] She didn't go
because we were in love.
We... we couldn't stay apart
for even a second.
How could she have left me,
or how could I let her go?
[breathes deeply]
Then one day...
[unsettling music playing]
- [Serin] My father wants to meet you.
- Hmm?
[spits] Your father?
[Serin] Yeah.
I think you'll get along well.
[Serin's father] Look, son,
this girl sacrificed her future for you.
If she had gone to New York,
her life would have been very different.
But she chose to stay for you.
So now, you need to get your act together.
Making music all day long is pointless.
You need to get a real job.
Serin won't go out with a loser anymore.
Got it?
[Mehmet] "Serin won't go out
with a loser anymore."
To be honest,
I felt like a complete idiot.
How would you feel if it were you?
[Latin dance music playing]
[crowd cheering]
[Serin] We eloped overseas,
inviting only our closest friends.
My parents only found out afterwards.
We liked having a small wedding
with only a few people.
This folder contains project information.
Please start with
the required registry procedures
as soon as possible and notify me, Mehmet.
[Mehmet] Okay. Yes, sir.
Good luck.
[Mehmet] Then I started working.
I'm wearing a tie, jacket, and suit.
I had to give up my music career
at that point.
I played on stage with my friends' band
every now and then.
Of course it wasn't the same.
[Serin] I got a job
and began designing for a new brand.
I admit that Mehmet was a great support.
THE BEST OF SOLDERING GUNS!
TO SOLDER YOUR HEART
He'd gotten a regular job.
We were starting our new life.
We were overjoyed and ecstatic.
[Serin] It was almost magical.
We were madly in love.
We wanted
to accomplish everything together.
We made important life decisions
with each other in mind.
We built our lives around each other.
And in my opinion,
this is what led to our current situation.
We focused on advancing our careers
without neglecting our relationship.
[Mehmet] At first, our marriage was okay.
We weren't one of those couples
whose magic fades away
after getting married.
{\an8}Don't trim here. Only the sides.
You've already told me.
No need to repeat yourself.
When I was a baby, my mom had me lay flat
so often that it's really flat.
[Serin gasps]
- [gasps]
- [laughing]
[Mehmet] You did it on purpose.
Well, now, shave it all.
[Serin laughing]
[Serin] I began designing for a brand.
I mean, tried to design.
[Mehmet] She was irritable while working.
She had her own private room set up.
And if you interrupted, all hell ensued.
Goddammit.
[Serin sighs]
What the hell?
[gasps]
[Serin] I was looking at your website,
and I came across models that looked
almost exactly like mine, you know?
Are you aware of this?
Okay, but why don't I know about this?
They're exactly the same
but with different colors.
[Serin] They stole my designs
and fired me.
You can't do that. You have no right.
How much will you compensate me?
Go fuck yourself, you fucking idiot!
[sighs]
[sighs]
[sighs]
The bastard was aware of everything.
[screams]
[emotional music playing]
[Serin] This was the first time
I regretted not going to New York.
[sighs]
I sent a few of my designs
to a place in New York.
I just wanted to try my luck.
I had little hope at first, but later...
[Serin groans]
[kisses]
[clears throat]
[pensive music playing]
DEAR SERİN YILMAZ, THANK YOU
FOR APPLYING TO VARGAND FASHION STUDIO
[Mehmet] She'd applied
to a place in New York
to design a collection for them.
If they were successful,
they would hire her.
She didn't say anything to me,
and I didn't tell her I knew.
[video game on TV]
[Serin] Hey, I'm back.
Hi, hon.
- How are you?
- Pretty good.
Hold on. Hold on, Serin.
[Mehmet] I expected her to tell me,
but she didn't.
[Serin] I was afraid he'd say no.
If he did, I probably wouldn't go.
He would persuade me to stay.
[Mehmet] I told you not to touch it!
All right?
[Mehmet] We started to argue all the time.
She would question
or oppose everything I said.
She kept taking things the wrong way.
Serin!
[photographer] One. Aha. Two.
Another one right here.
Yes, just like that.
All right.
Oh my God.
- [laughs]
- Sure you don't want to model this?
No, thank you. She's beautiful.
I guess you're still the model for today.
I'm good with that. All right?
- [model] Shawn?
- Yeah.
- Ready?
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Sure.
[Shawn] I love your profile.
[phone line ringing]
[Serin] Every time I go to the studio
for a photo shoot,
there is fighting, yelling, and jealousy.
[Shawn] I want you to look this way.
- Exactly.
- I have to take this.
[Shawn] Yeah, no worries.
[Shawn] All right, so let's...
- Hello!
- Where are you?
At the photo session.
- Still at the photo session?
- We're photographing the collection.
It's taking some time,
but it's going great.
I just got home from work,
and I can't believe you've done it again!
How many times do I have to tell you
not to put anything on my instrument?
What's so hard to understand?
You know how sensitive I am about this.
It's either you do it on purpose,
or you just decided to ignore me...
I'm not done yet, Mehmet.
Let's talk about this at home.
I can't believe it.
- What are you saying?
- [Shawn] Serin?
[Serin] Uh, yeah, I'm coming.
- [Shawn] Yeah?
- [Serin] Yeah, yeah.
- İyi?
- İyi. Yeah.
Okay. I'm coming.
I'm gonna have to hang up now.
Who's there with you?
[Serin] The production team.
You shooting a movie?
What's taking so long?
[laughs]
[sigh] Um... Okay, please.
I need you to calm down.
I'm almost done.
We can discuss this when I get back home.
You don't have to come home.
Do whatever you want.
- Our place is like a hotel anyway.
- I'm hanging up now.
[sighs] I'm so sorry.
[sighs]
- So the lighting is better?
- [Shawn] Perfect.
[Serin] Fuck.
- [Shawn] Everything okay?
- [Serin] Yeah.
[door opens]
[Mehmet] You finally made it home.
- Don't start again with your nonsense.
- Who am I? The housekeeper?
I've told you to stop disturbing me
when I'm at work.
Am I the damn housekeeper?
Just tell me. Who am I?
What the hell am I to you? Hmm?
Have you seen the time?
And who the fuck was he?
- [tense music plays]
- What the hell are you implying?
I worked all day long.
What are you trying to say?
- What did you drink? My God. Just answer.
- Are you serious right now?
[tense music plays]
What does "you don't
have to come home" mean?
What were you doing out so late?
Who was that guy I heard on the phone?
[tense music plays]
I heard him giggling
while we were talking on the phone.
Yeah? So what? Was he supposed to be
yelling like you were?
- Are you defending him?
- [tense music plays]
I mean, do happy people irritate you?
If you were so pleased,
then why did you come home?
You should've stayed out having drinks
with your friend!
I thought I was your husband!
I wasn't having drinks. I was working
and came home as soon...
- That's bull...
- [tense music plays]
[alarm ringing]
[Serin] Mehmet?
[alarm ringing]
[sighs] Mehmet.
[alarm ringing]
[Serin sighs]
[Serin groans]
[alarm stops]
CANSU - NEW MESSAGE
HI, I'M BACK
SO HOW ARE YOU?
GREAT TO TALK TO YOU
MEHMET, DO YOU HAVE TIME?
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
I WISH YOU WERE THERE YESTERDAY
PARTY ON FRIDAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN?
DO YOU THINK THIS DRESS IS GOOD
FOR A WORK MEAL?
Whoa.
[Mehmet groans]
[groans]
[Serin exhales]
Okay, I'm listening.
[Mehmet] I don't like
being accused like this.
About a month ago, we were at a concert.
Uh, I think it was in Kadıköy.
You were there, too, but you left early.
You would have already met this girl
if you had stayed. Okay?
It's that simple.
She came there that day,
and we happened to cross paths.
- I hadn't seen her in years, you know?
- Hmm?
Yeah. Also, if I'm gonna do the things
you're accusing me of,
I would've password-locked it.
Know what I'm saying?
I'd use a password if I had a secret
or anything to hide from you.
- You can check my phone as you please.
- What a convenient excuse.
- Honey, I can call her. Do you want me to?
- This is all too convenient.
Convenient? I didn't do anything wrong.
What happened after the concert
for her to send you such intimate photos?
Do you want me to be
completely honest with you?
What happened after the concert?
Nothing happened. Nothing at all. Come on.
She came to the show
and left like everyone else.
- Come on. I don't believe you.
- What? I swear!
- We only talked on the phone.
- What happened after the concert?
Nothing happened. I finished my drink.
Why does she text you every morning
if that's true?
- I gave her a ride home. She was drunk.
- You gave her a ride home.
- I did.
- Oh. Bravo!
- So?
- I meant to...
What happened then at home?
Are you kidding me or something!
It's all here.
Do you see anything I wrote
that's ambiguous?
Is there any evidence of wrongdoing?
What did you do after you dropped her off?
I came straight home. It's not my fault
if she sends me inappropriate photos.
I mean, if she's into me...
Are you her stylist for her to send you
her lurid pictures every morning?
She's been asking you about
her business lunch outfits for a month.
- And what the hell is this?
- Lurid, seriously?
That night she was drunk,
who says you didn't stay at her place?
I didn't. I'm telling you the truth.
Nothing happened between us.
You're telling the truth? It's over!
I was just being nice to her.
She was drunk. I gave her a ride.
She's just grateful to me for helping her.
[door slams]
I didn't do anything wrong, all right?
[coughs]
Hey, why did you take off your ring,
Serin, huh?
[Serin] Mehmet,
I've been thinking a lot about us.
It's so difficult to admit that we
no longer feel real love for each other
and that we've been sucked into
a passionless, dreary, monotonous life.
But it is what it is.
Thinking about messaging a woman
is a dead giveaway.
We cannot go on like this.
We shouldn't do it.
I mean, I can't. I'm very sorry.
I wrote this letter because
it's easier than fighting about it.
We wouldn't hear and listen to each other.
Allegations, denials...
I don't have the energy for it.
I have no desire to withstand
a tumultuous marriage, Mehmet.
I'd like a divorce.
[Mehmet sighs]
That's it. Just like that.
It was that easy for her.
Just because I texted someone else.
[therapist] Well, how would you feel
if Serin texted someone?
Someone she'd known in the past.
[therapist] How would you feel
if Mehmet applied for a job
in another country
without telling you?
[breathes deeply]
Now, I wanna ask you a question.
But please think about it carefully
before you answer.
Do you believe you'd fall in love again
if you met today
the same way you did ten years ago?
We're completely different people
right now.
So maybe we wouldn't even like each other.
Yeah, we're not the same.
Anyway, does it really matter?
We're awaiting a court date.
We've already filed for divorce.
And this will be
our last session with you.
Okay.
Well, seeing as this is our last session,
I wanna make one more recommendation.
[Mehmet] Why would I take your passport?
Hello.
We're going to the airport.
[therapist] When is
your business interview in New York?
[Serin] Next month.
[therapist] Perfect.
Would you be able to travel together?
This is what I'd like you to do.
Act as if you're meeting
for the first time.
[Mehmet] My only goal is to help you.
Let's go if you want. Please.
[ethereal music playing]
[chuckles] I don't think we can do this.
Why can't we do this?
Never let go of my hand again.
And don't let go of mine.
[Mehmet] I still love you.
You know that, right?
I miss us.
I feel the same.
Just let go and have fun with it.
[echoing sigh]
[Mehmet] I got you something
green and gingery.
I thought it might help with the hangover.
And you might like it too.
Thank you.
Drinking and smoking tore me apart.
You finally got your suitcase!
- I did.
- Mmm?
- Anything missing from it?
- No.
Awesome.
Yummy.
- Do you like it?
- Mm-hmm.
[sighs]
[exhales]
[chuckles]
I guess the therapist was right,
wasn't she?
[chuckles]
Yesterday felt like old times.
- Yeah, it definitely did.
- Mmm.
We laughed.
We were cheerful. Just how we used to be.
We talked too.
We hadn't talked like this in a long time.
And we didn't fight.
At least we didn't fight with each other.
[both laughing]
- Yeah, right.
- Does your hand hurt?
No, it's okay.
Yesterday, I saw the old Mehmet in you.
[sentimental music playing]
The one full of passion.
Do you remember
what the therapist said to us?
Hmm?
Do you believe you'd fall in love
with each other again if you met today?
I would.
[Serin] Sure.
I would definitely fall in love
with that guy from last night.
[laughs]
But still, we didn't meet yesterday.
[chuckles]
What are you saying?
Nothing really changed, Mehmet.
The reasons that brought us to this point
didn't dissipate overnight.
Last night, for me, was one of the most
unforgettable nights of my life.
But I'm almost positive
that when we get back to Istanbul,
we'll be fighting again.
That we'll make each other's lives
miserable again.
I don't wanna be that kind of woman.
I don't like myself being moody,
yelling all the time.
[sighs]
I wanna be myself
and for us to be together...
[bottle crunching]
I can't give you what you ask for.
And what have I asked from you?
- What have I asked for from you?
- [sighs]
You mentioned it last night.
I'm not ready to become a mother.
- Okay.
- I don't want to.
And I don't wanna live here.
I never wanna move to this town.
I know.
That's why we should set each other free.
- There's no other way, I mean...
- There are many ways.
I told you many times.
And again last night.
To save our marriage, we have to be
willing to keep living together.
But instead,
you'd rather live alone in this city
and ruin us for good.
Is that so?
So it's all my fault, then?
You were the one willing to get a divorce
in the first place. Not me.
At least, I wasn't. Not me.
But you could've been supportive.
Instead, you discouraged and questioned me
rather than staying by my side
and supporting me.
[sighs]
That's our problem.
When it involves your work,
nothing else matters.
But when it comes to my work,
which has been my dream for years,
I'm labeled selfish.
What about my job?
Did you forget all the sacrifices I made?
Working hard just to make you comfortable.
While you were planning behind my back
to move abroad.
Which gave you an excuse to cheat on me
with the first girl who asked you.
I didn't cheat on you.
Yeah, keep telling yourself that.
I really wonder what would have happened
if I hadn't seen those text messages.
Serin.
I never cheated on you in my life.
I'm not the type of man to do that.
I remind you that you were the one who
pursued me while you were already taken.
[Serin gasps]
Get out!
I want you to leave.
[emotional music playing]
We are on the brink of divorce.
Are you aware
that the date has been set, Serin?
This isn't a game.
I have to go to an appointment. I'm late.
You have an appointment.
Your work and this damn city
is more important than us.
Everything is more important than me.
And you say you love me. At least
that's what you told me last night.
Yeah, Mehmet, I love you.
But I don't want this.
Why is it hard for you to understand me?
[Serin sighs]
All right.
And I don't wanna live with someone
who doesn't wanna live with me anymore.
[sighs]
[door closes]
[sobs]
[electronic music playing]
[sobs]
[crowd cheering]
[woman] I love you!
[indistinct chattering]
- Hello.
- Hi.
[Serin] Do you think
this goes with the color?
[indistinct chattering]
[crowd cheering]
[train bell chimes]
Oh.
So you're leaving?
[Serin] Yes.
I've found a place on the Upper West Side.
It's closer to work.
Oh. I have something for you.
From Mehmet.
[Serin] Hmm.
Thank you.
It was a pleasure meeting you.
[Mehmet] Serin, this is my first time
writing a letter.
I don't know if I can do it,
but I'll give it a shot.
Maybe I'll be able
to express myself better than in person.
You were right. I wasn't good enough
to be the man you wanted or deserved.
Whatever the reason for my actions,
I apologize for talking to that woman.
I'm really sorry for upsetting you
and making you feel worthless and lonely.
And I'm sorry I didn't encourage you
to pursue your dreams.
I'm very sorry
if I ever gave you the impression
that I didn't love and understand you.
Serin, I can't stand seeing you unhappy.
I was so afraid of losing you,
and yet it still happened.
And, yes, we both had dreams
when we first met.
And eventually,
we had to give up on some of them.
Could we have done better
than just blaming each other?
I don't know.
But one thing I do know is
that couples who do achieve
getting old together also fight.
The set is ready. Come on!
- Okay. I'm coming.
- Come.
They, too, become tired, bored,
and eventually want to give up.
[inaudible]
There's only one reason
why they don't do it.
They believe they will still be there
for each other at home,
even after everything
and everyone have gone.
Isn't this belief precisely
what you call "love and passion"
and what I call "home?"
[photographer] Perfect.
I wanted us to believe this. So much.
To say to the world, "We are one."
I really wanted us not to give up
because, well, I'm still in love with you.
Your return ticket is still available.
If you change your mind,
I'll be boarding the flight to Istanbul.
[camera shutter clicking]
[photographer] Chin a little to the right.
A little up. Okay.
Yes. Yes.
I'm so sorry.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Everything is okay. I...
I have to go.
Can we make you more comfortable?
No. Thank you for everything,
but I have to go.
- Sorry about that.
- Okay, um...
Bye.
[emotional music playing]
[panting]
- [Serin] Please.
- No.
- Please, please, please.
- [woman] You're too late.
My husband is on the plane. Please.
But we need your passport real quick.
Okay, thank you.
[Serin panting]
Excuse me.
- What are you doing?
- Can I get in?
The gate is closed.
- But my husband is on the plane.
- I'm sorry.
Please let me in.
Sorry, but you are not allowed
to get inside at this time.
You cannot leave the plane like that.
- I am getting off. I've changed my mind.
- [officer] Excuse me. Sir! Sir.
- I'm not flying.
- You can't get out like that.
- I'm not flying.
- You have to go back to the plane.
- Mehmet!
- I'm not flying. Sorry about that.
[woman] Sir, I need to escort you.
[sighs]
Call someone.
I don't wanna move to another country
without you, my love.
You have every right to be angry.
I'm sorry.
Did you get the job?
I just won't accept it.
Is it okay if we don't divorce?
[woman] Please excuse me.
But I have to escort you.
Can you do what she says, please?
Uh, listen.
[romantic music playing]
She is my wife,
and, uh, she comes with me.
If the gate isn't closed yet.
Just give me a second, okay?
Please. I appreciate it. I appreciate it.
[romantic music continues]
It's okay?
I have the green light? All right.
Sir? Sir.
- It's okay. We'll get your wife.
- [Mehmet] Thank you.
Thank you.
[Serin exclaims]
[both laughing]
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Bye!
[romantic music continues]
[Serin laughs]
- This is some kind of joke. Unbelievable.
- [Serin laughing]
[both laughing]
Oh my God.
[Serin laughing]
[Mehmet] Okay.
[both laugh]
[both laughing]
[Serin] Lost again.
[electronic music playing]
[music fades]
