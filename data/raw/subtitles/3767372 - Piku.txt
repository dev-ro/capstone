accident intentionally?

...this one here...
That was another lady driver
but that's not the point...
Oh really?
Why do accidents happen with you only?
Look don't deviate...
Why is it always that
the guy in front is at fault?
All I know that he has broken this...
Oh hello..settle it or it's
a sure case of 'l-lit and run'...
Exactly.
You can't be so safe with the
designs otherwise there is no point

We cou
d've discussed at home..?
We live in the same house.

Why did you give it
to the Receptionist..?

in the bathroom...obviously...
...he must've been
sitting on the commode...
didn't you keep the
yogurt in the fridge?
It's gone sour...

my problems are smalL.
When you'll be my

Urine test normal.
Diabetes negative..kidney

Budhan..!

And why did you give it to her?
That's not the point Dad.
Srivastav uncle asked
for blood Count ONLY.
...then why did you
get these extra tests done'?
so there's nothing in the report?
look at your face...everything
is normal but you are not happy...
really...things will be better
off if something comes out...
kidney..or lung or
diabetes or something...
at least then..there will
a solution to this house.
Look..
've given you full freedom.
don't talk to me like that.

I had to meet Aniket today
for 
unch...but I am here. With you.
Is this how I am going to
lead my life'? discussing your shit'?!

And this your relationship status.

..when I mop the floor,
he walks behind me
with his dirty shoes,
checking the room as
if I'll steal something...
So so?
What is so wrong in that..?
Three times a day I clean the
toilet and he's still not satisfied...
and today he crossed the limits...he
said I've stolen the toilet cleaner.
You think I'll do that?
Then where did it go?
one minute...dad

Look he didn't mean that...
No he's suspecting me all the
time...just pay my dues and I'll leave
I told you there's
no balance..fine Piku...

kept eight hundred and fifty rupees.
She didn't turn up for three

And he doesn't vote!
I was somehow tolerating him..
you were right...
He's such a jerk!
Did dad call you up?
Yes
Hun..
Why did you react like this..?
Like what?
I said Dad called, so you said "hun"
Right...l asked if Dad called you
and you said "Yes" so I said "hum"?
so what's wrong?
- Who reacts like that, What is "huh"
Dad called me...so
you should say "ok"...
...what is "Hun"
I know but you said you
said "yes" ...so I said "hun"
NO you didn't say, you said "hun"
Come on Piku...
...I just said "hun"
so what's wrong in it
Piku mentioned yellow. . pulp. .
Right but then 
ater..
It was greenish..not black,
but greenish...yellowish green.
Why don't you both
sit with a shade card?
What percent of green..how

ow....
shit is shit....
..mind your business..!
- But Grand Pa.
my heart says.
One day you'll have a great motion...
just the way you desire...lots...
Yeah...then I will
die. . happy. . satisfied...
Why is it a must to talk about
death right early in the morning?
why can't he talk
about something positive?
What is so negative about death..
I am changing the medication dear...
you can alternate with this one...
And remember one thing..where
there is a will..there is a way...
...and the way is of outside only...
Pappu you need to
leave for Ivlotibaug...
make sure you get there on time...
- Sure sir...
God knows when the
winters will come...
this summer has been harsh...
I haven't caused it...
did I say it's because of you...?
Then why are you telling me
That's because you're
sitting here so I am talking
imagine that I am not
here and keep quiet...
It's useless talking to you...
So don't talk... go home
and don't come here from tomorrow...
Why should I not come?
Because I am trying to work.
Oh really...even after been thrown out
of your job you still have such an ego'?
Why is it really important
for you to keep reminding me of that?
But that's the truth...
I-I imachal taxi stand. . yes.
No no I understand Rosy,
but your Piku madam said she didn't want
any taxi from us so I didn't send anyone.
fine I'll send...
Hey who's turn is it to drop
that madam from Chitranjan Park?
Why are you guys si
ent..?
She's a regular client...you'll
have to tolerate her...
...and just because she insists on
driving fast doesn't mean you do that...
...don't you have your own mind?
See no one wants to go...
so why're you forcing them?
One minute...don't you
talk like Union leaders here.
Nannu...go take the car...
and I am aware what you
and your daughter are up to...
Ritu is your sister
Whatever it is...just watch out...
Excuse me!
- Yeah...you both
Aunt. . . how are you..'?
Fine...
- Aah here she is..
Hey Bhaskor da..how are you?
Did you pass Motion?
Hello ma'am.
- Hello.
These sweet pills won't help
you much...start allopathy...
illiterate.
Hi...
Happy birthday sister.
..so tell me what's the latest..?
..nothing..usual..
..how was your vacation?
Shimla was fantastic..you
must go once..
And enjoy yourself. .
Aah. . mutton smelling good
anyways. .vvhere is uncle?
Why such a swollen face?
What happened?
well she isn't married yet..
that's why all this...
..nothing serious I guess..
or am I missing something Piku?
I mean I am not saying I want
to take a long holiday...
...but may be just for a day or two
I can go somewhere..
Piku's right.
...every normal person
needs a break...
...for relaxation.
Oh nonsense...people aren't
relaxed in their own homes...
...with their own families but
they don't mind spending...
...on a train or a plane ticket
just to get to some far away hotel...
...and using some e
se's
used beddings... to feel relaxed...
...and these travel companies are
to blamed for it...it's all in the mind...
lam telling you..find
a nice boy..and..
Isn't your sex life active'?
Your parTnenSyed?
It's a need
right. . its a need...
but that's not a permanent solution...
why don't you both get married ya..
Aunt I don't Know..I'm
not even sure..about him..
Ah..again that useless topic..
You don't know marriage
is a bad word in our house...?
People with low IQ only get married
...you mean I am low IQ'?
My sister was low IQ'?
In this whole world everyone
who is married is low IQ'? - l-li..hi...
Hope you are good...
your Telegraph..last 3O days.
Aah!

ove
y__!
Nothing like Kolkata news..
don't change the topic dada.
Don't waste your time.
- Again?
To be together in
good times and bad...
...is it low IQ'?
there's no salt in this..?
I couldn't find salt...
..to take care of
BP...best to avoid...
But we don't have BP!
so stop hiding like this.
again your changing the topic..?
Was my sister lovv IQ?
Not just constipation,
dad has problems with women too...
No...not women but their
mentality is what I can't stand...
...your sister too..all her
life she just wanted to please me..
...that was her only
purpose..no aim for herself.
...I wanted her to
be independent...but no..
..she surrendered
herself in my service.
So what's wrong with that?
Everything is wrong!
throwing away your identity..your
knowledge..respect..brain..
in the fire while taking the seven
vows and then leading your life...
...well that is a Low IQ decision.
...and I don't want
Piku to take this decision.
But brother, don't say like that
today, on sister's birthday at least.
..when she was alive,
she was not happy...
...wheh she was dying she was hot happy
and how even after dying she ls lsh't happy...
...see...that's what I mean...
You're really insensitive dad.
Piku.. she was my wife..
I can say anything.
But she loved you..
I also loved her..and still do..
Then why are you criticising mom..?
Because I am a critical person..
...brutal and honest.
I am entitled to think
whatever I want to about her...
...but that doesn't mean
that I don't love her...
This shirt that I am wearing.
..she gifted me on my birthday...
...so I am wearing it for her today...
Piku find a right man..and get married
Leaving your father's home after getting
married and living in another man's house...
...taking care of that
new one...how foolish...
I gave birth to you...didn't l?
- yes
No tell me...l gave birth to you.
Yes Dad
I never left you and went
away...so now I am your chi
d..
you do the same.
I completely agree with
Bhaskor da's philosophy
God knows how did my sister
tolerate you for all these years.
...I don't know..no wonder she died
early..you only mustK/e given her BF'
I give BP to you..to Piku,
even to Srivastava...did you all die?
Would you like some Ice cream/P
Obvious
y..
why I did I get it then?
Oh just ignore what Piku
says...She doesn't mean it...
Fine...
 am giving these bills to the accounts
department...just get the payment released...
of course...by the
way how's your mother?
Don't even know how
I was born in that family...
...just waiting to get out of there...
...anyway tell your partner to mend her
ways or get used to travelling in a Metro
Why don't you tell her...
Piku..
Piku..
L-li..
- all well..'?
Ya__
I know because of my drivers...
look its fine..
I don't have time for
all this discussion...
So when should I come?
For what?
- To discuss this driver issue...
you've had a word with Syed, right?
Ya but.
So then its fine...
See you..
Bye
You need to be a
bit easy with Piku....
...I am really worried for her..
Oh...then why did you get married
thrice? If you were so worried..
Excuse me?
After Piku's mother passed away,
Piku needed you..
so I shou
d've shifted here
with Eisha in your house...
...gotten married to you...
...just because my sister
was no more...?
hah! only you can have
such idiotic thoughts.
Piku and Eisha..were
never your priority...
All I am saying is
that..and that is very sad..
ls this why you don't like me..?
No I've enough reasons
to not like you...
...But don't you feed this marriage
nonsense in Piku's mind, don't..
Grand Pa doesn't want to meet you...
tell him I am not here to
discuss the selling of Kolkata house
then why are you here?
to know the condition of my stomach?
Good evening dada; how are you.
Actually I met a builder yesterday.
he is ready to negotiate...
...so I spent my own money
for the flight ticket
....just to come and meet you..
you know my decision...
Dada. .try and understand
There is no need to discuss
the same topic again and again...
Go!
- It's a golden opportunity...
...super deal..all these things must
be clone while you're still here...
...then you can peacefully...
listen Budhan...
- yes Grand Pa.
Hope you haven't
made tea for him yet...?
I am about to...
no need...no need..
..just shut the door when
this man leaves...
...and don't open it
if he comes back again...
Irritating man.
Oh that's an insult!
I made so much of effort
to negotiate with the builder...
is this how you treat me'?
...I'll tell Piku dicii...she's practical
and will dispose off your house...
Ya fine...go ahead...
I rang the bell for an hour...
useless old man...wasted my time.
...126!88..
its normaL.
L-low are you respected sir'?
Very serious..BP is normaL.
This is not a joke Piku..
Please sit
Greetings ma'am..
That idiot, Nobendu, he again came last night
to discuss the selling of Kolkata house...
I will not sell that house..
that old house is a pain!
- what?
Pain!
I have told you before...l
will not sell Cl-IAMPA KUNJ!
..this year I will go to KolkataL.
I have decided..end of discussion!
Fine then end this discussion
Tell Nobendu not to come again...
what's there to get so affected...
Affected?
Of course I'll be...
I am an emotional man...
If you were emotional...my
sister would've been happy.
Listen you Dutta sisters...
I know your habit of blame game...
...and I worry..my Piku
is also becoming like one of you..
...what your Banerjis are like,
well I also know that.
that Mont Baneﬂt. . your Aunt
Piku...whole day she roams around in
the house in just a flimsy night gown...
...that too without a Bra..!
Really Aunty?!
- Ivlaa even you do the same.
Hey...shut up...l Only do
that when I am alone at home...!
Anyways...what's the point in getting
BF' checked 100 times in a day...
...whatever this Nobendu came
and said and you started panicking?
...these are all age related
problems...what's so abnormal in it..?
but...what if my BP shoots up?
everyone has some issue or
the other in their lives...
...just for a day if you haven't crapped,
there isn't any need for this drama!
Nothing has happened to you; you are
just simply going through menopause...
even men go through menopause...
Oh ignore what she's saying...
One minute. . . menopause. . . me?
...no way...here take
a look..he's Asaako...
he cycled even at the age of 99...
died just last week...
how did he die'?
L-lear-t attack. . cancer. . brain damage. . '?

He who cycles even at the age of 99,

Sanju is coming to have a talk...
...go change your clothes
or go to the stand...
Why what's wrong with these clothes?
...and in any case he's not
coming to take you back with him..
Look what he's saying mom...
at least we can ask for a settlement?
Well he's already left you
so what are you going to settle?
Now earn. . . live your
life. . . respectfully
You're just frustrated and
you don't want even me to be happy...
If you were so worried
about your happiness then.
...why did you steal your mother-in-lavws
diamond ring and give it to mom?
It wasn't your
ring...that she stole...
what does he have anyways
Do you even know what honesty means?
...treachery never brings
happiness...do you get that?
As if you've been righteous always...
...e><aotly...how do we know why
were you thrown out from your job...
Hello..again. where? Honda.
What the ta><i's been hit again...
Who was the client?

You guys chat..I'll just get my Laptop
VVe

...whatever it may be...these are known
drivers...you're safe with them...
...not only do they listen
to you...they're also scared of you...
Nothing like that...
So what about that Honda case...?
I was getting late for a meeting
so I asked him to speed up...
...normal speeding up...he banged...
this time again you told
him not to stop after banging...
...and even if he did,
Delhi Police listens only to women...
...no matter whoever's
fault it may be...
you mean I am making
them break the rules?
No no I have no problems
with that...break them,
as long as no one gets hurt...
...in any case I send the
damages to your office so it's ok...
No it's not ok...l can take
an auto...l can manage myself...
..c'mon Piku; he's just saying that he
has some decent drivers working for him..
So it's my fault?
See the point is, everything is mutual...
you don't like them, they don't like you..
did they say this..?
no, but does it matter...
...when it's the truth..
Got to leave...
Q Kay-
there won't be a
need to take an auto...
See you..

Don't be so judgmentaL.

It's not like that.

Do you plan to marry?
I am single...if I find a nice girl,
why not..l mean a nice girl..
but she is very moody.
Like me.
And she's not a virgin...right Piku?
Dad. - No no no..what
do you mean by 'nic:e' '?
she has her own business.
She's financially independent...
sexually independent...
...need based...just looking
for emotional partnership.
...so is she 'nice' according to you?
Dad...
- I mean it depends.
Depends on?
- I am leaving...
Where. ..?
Aunty will drop you home.
Ya so...
what were you saying.
I said it depends...
no..no..let me be...
Dad its late. .
Sister...
I tried waking you up at 4 am...
...but you didn't open the
door so I called for Dr. Srivastava...
Nothing to worry...
...a bit of shallow breathing...
pulse drop...that's it...
...Dr Ivlukherjee has
given him medicines...
right now he's ok..
at his age,
we should not take any risks...
get his tests done...
It's a must.
- Sure.
L-low are you young man...
...how's everyone at home?
All okay uncle... what happened?
Nothing serious...he just
enjoyed a bit too much...
yeah.. cancel my meetings.
I won't come.
- Budhan, keep the lunch simple today.
...put the pan.

On my head...
obviously on the burner...
I'll go to...
I'll go to Kolkata...
PIKU
that idiot Nobendu. ..
...I won't sell Champa Kunj
l-low are you'?
- o mother...
I will go to Kolkata
No uncle, I am not worried for him...
...in fact it makes
no difference to him...
...if he wants to go he'll go...he
doesn't care about anybody else.
now do I write on a stamp paper that
I will not die during this trip...
...will that be fine.
look at his health.
Forget logic...from here to
airport and from there to Kolkata...
It's too much Dada
Flight?
Who said I'll take a f
ight...?
I'll get palpitations on it...
- Give me some tea
BP fluctuates at that height.
...bathrooms are claustrophobic
palpitation. . . nervousness.
its bad for my condition.
I am not going by train certainly.
Train? Never.
never.. never... this train movement
shakes up everything inside...
I get constipation.
that is not a good option.
Just five days back
you've gotten up from bed.
cou
d've died...it was
my marriage anniversary...
...why did he have to drink and dance?
and then he comes home...drinks...
Budhan why did you give him the drink?
Piku you also didn't bother.
this old man has gone senile!
look you don't interfere.
No one is asking you.
You're my sister's husband
that's why I am concerned...
But your sister is no more..
so keep quiet.
hey shrivastava.
there is one way.
I've an idea.
I was thinking exactly the same...
...you might get tired but
then you can stop anywhere and walk...
Correct. . correct. . correct.
that way things will be in control.
according to my convenience.
Yes
As in?
As in nothing...done...decided!

from CR park to Kolkata?

suitcases kept in the garage

If you don't know how to do business

I'll handle them
and don't take any bookings
Haven't you informed at home?
No..
..so what is your
father's real problem?
Nothing.
..a weak stomach...that's it...
Then tell him to do

...in any case we
have that 'throne'...
...wherever he feels the urge,
we'll stop...
He doesn't eat unless he...
I got it...
...there he is...
...not looking happy though..
Did the army win the war..?
..a bit.. there were so many
mosquitoes that I could not concentrate.
You don't have to meditate...
...this is the only job that happens
on its own...without any effort
Bill!
So much butter.
Checked?
Ye sir all safe
In the morning when I got the call, it seemed
you needed to reach Kolkata today itself...
...but the way family is going now...
...as if out for a picnic... forget 48,
we'll not reach Kolkata even in 72 hours.
Yes...what was the need of
stopping there to buy bangles...
...she could have bought them
at Kolkata...
she has got no sense of time.
I have no sense of time...
You're not going to let me get married...
let me enjoy these bangles at least
Seriously?
most people here would marry off
their daughters just when they're born
and he doesn't want
you to get married..?
That's strange...
...this doesn't happen
even in western culture.
western culture is not a benchmark
of progress..is that clear?
We were always ahead of them...
always..that..a..Rani La><mi Bai,
Sarojini Naidu,
and...Kadimbini Ganguly,
...all these fine women spent their
whole life in serving the country
and all she wants
to do is please a boy?!
so many times I have told
you Annie Besant wasn't an Indian...
Still she fought for
our country's independence..!
But all these women were married.
Yes...but with a purpose.
Marriage is not wrong...
Marriage is not wrong...but
it must have a purpose...
All that a husband wants is that wife should
serve food during the day and sex at night...
...but is that what a
woman is made for...nooo...
that is why marriage
without any purpose is low IQ
Fine but not all women
are nice and simple...
...you don't know...many of them
are very manipulative and scheming...
...what does one do then?
women should be scheming...it's not
wrong... because man is like that...
...that's why it's alright
for her to be scheming...
What are you looking at her for?
No aunty...
...ya Driver is fine...hmm...
...about half way
listen..they're not bad people.
No sometimes that man talks
sense...then suddenly he loses it..
You want the slippers now ...?
yes...
- Why do you want it now?
I feel I just unnecessarily
got carried away and now I am stuck...
...between this crazy
father-daughter duo...
As if you had a great life at home...
I might just run away
in between...l am telling you.
no still too far...not
even halfway...
I don't know if they really want to get
there or they're just on a joy ride...
hey...lool< there ..l had kept
my slippers in the bag.
Budhan had kept it in the suitcase
found...
- can't hear you..bad signaL.
Budhan kept it. ..?
What's this...?
...are you planning to kill him?
Mad or what '2
It's his...
Oh is he planning a murder?
Perhaps for safety
safety. . _ !

source of income as well...

running this taxi business'?
It was my father's
business actually...so I...

I had a job earlier...
Where?
Saudi...civil construction.
Is this what an Engineer does to
earn a living'? A taxi business'? Sad.
They'd promised a big position
at the time of the interview...
but once I got there...l
realized I was duped...
Why didn't you come back?
My passport was them
with a contract of two years!
God! but who gives the passport
That's the way it is...
So then...?
I had a tiff with my supervisor,
even though I was right...
I lost my job...
Hey Piku...your ‘Paanchu
babu..!' (cry baby)
What's that?
Nothing...
...
 mean if you know you were
right then why that sullen face...?
all honest men in the world
have faced similar consequences...
...it's nothing new...
...well neither will you gain
my sympathy nor try to gain Piku's...
so you came back..?
Ya...and handling this
ta><i business since then...

Saudi are fighting with the govt.
for their driving rights...

...and you say you don't
like driving...that's weird.
Not really...those
countries are like that...
Ya but your country isn't...
...moreover...driving
liberates a woman. ..
Are you saying all this to impress
me or you really do respect women?
Isn't it written on my face?

this question mark kind of thing...
...and when we...one minute...

Who all stay in Kolkata...?
Uncle...aunt...

In any case one leg of
Bengalis is always in Calcutta...

Correct. . . Correct ...
But there is nothing for me Babe...
...few relatives...l have no connection

Are you going to
sell off your home ...?
Don't know...

Wonder why parents feel satisfied in
emotionally blackmailing their kids...
...if you were a burden ...you
would've been sitting in Delhi..
...she wouldn't have cared to
take you all the way to Kolkata...
...so close your eyes
and sit quiet for sometime...
Sky won't fall if you don't hear
some words
if we keep going like this,
we will take forever to reach...
OK shall we...?
But...what if on the way I
feel like passing motion...then...?

Champa kunj...here I am...!
No no...whole night
we were just awake...
Brother...you must be very tired...?
I am fine...
Get the luggage
Nothing's changed here...
And whose idea was
it to do this road journey?
Goshh! you need
a heart to do that...
RanamcomemKaku
he's Rana Chouclhry...
Greetings...Mr Choudhry...
please sit...
Hey Binod, he's not Bengali...
He's the owner of l-limachal
Tourist Taxi stand...
...his driver didn't
come so he drove us...
Oh...that means Delhi people aren't
as bad as we think them to be here...
Please don't mind...
Not her fault...well that is the
perception about Delhi people...
so....Piku...
...get that chair
in...I'll have to leave...
Where?
Where...you can't be going
back to Delhi right now...
...go tomorrow morning...
No its fine...really...I'll leave...
No one asked you...
Budhan...
Yes
Where have you kept my luggage...?
In that room down there...
No...keep it up
stairs...in that room...
"Where did that chair come from?"
That's grand pa's commode...
...don't touch it...haven't
cleaned it with an ANTISEPTIC yet..."
the whole feel of this house has
changed...because brother's here...
ya...but Piku...
...don't know what
she has grown up to be...
...first she stays with
her aunt Chhobi ...plus single...
...living in Delhi...
He

o...yes Nobendu...right...
...he has not told
me anything...why...
...oh...ok...
What happened?
Nobendu is saying...brother
has come to fix the house deal...
I am not surprised.
Ivlusfve done sitting in Delhi...
It can't be true...
I warned you...but
you shouted at me...
...now see for yourself...
...you respect him so much
but for him we are nobody...huh...
You're over reacting...l
don't think its anything to worry...
How's Dr Shrivastava?
He will miss you
I don't think so...
...Dad just forces
him to come everyday...
.l never force anybody, never.
There...Mr. Choudhary...join us
Pass me some pepper Piku...
I had no idea that your bowel
problem had become so chronic?
I don't think it's in our family...
Of course it is!
Our father had it!
But how would you remember...
...you were busy in fooling around
with life...fun...women.. all that.
Were the elders just watching
the show if he was fooling around...?
...and when sister in law and almost decided
to get him married to her sister Chhobi,
...then what was the
need to come and see me...?
Next day I had my M.Com exam...
final paper...but no one cared!
Mom just expressed
it to grandma that...
...its fun if two brother's
are married to two sisters...
...but its not that she
didn't love you when you came...
You were not even born
then Piku...how would you know
All I know is when mom
was in the hospital...she said...
...whenever I would get married,
you'll do the rituals on her behalf...
...not aunt Chhobi...
After mom, you are
like a mother to me
Why dig the old graves...she's come
here after so many years
But what did I say...
No no ...don't stop
her...she's right...
...this frustration
is not right...it causes...
Negativity
right...negativity...and
that causes indigestion and then...
Constipation. ..?
Amazing! l-low do you connect
everything with the stomach'?
Coz everything is
connected to the stomach!
A person's emotion
depends on his motion...
This is all your nonsense
theory...in your own head...
...it's not that your
constipated all the time...?
Why're you getting angry with me...?
I am not getting angry...
...but you don't discuss
anything other than this Dad...
...there's a limit...
Just re
a>< brother...
I am relaxed
And you don't talk much...!
Do you know Piku...for how
long your uncle sits on the pot...'?
What do you mean...
...father had
constipation...brother has...
...and you also have the same
...its in the family...
No brother...
Yes father had...
No...
You had constipation.
Why are you looking at me?
...Unc
e you know about
the water shortage in Delhi...
...still he wants a bucket
full of water...
...because he's not satisfied
with that jet spray...
No that's because that jet has a sharp
flow of water...it hurts me here...
And in winters he
demands hot water...
...now tell me who needs hot
vvater to clean his...back side?
You must know that every third person
in America has the same problem...
...in fact constipation
is their biggest health issue...
Really?
- Of course!
...still they live care free...
...
ooking at their faces can you ever
tell what's going on inside them...?
Who cares? They're the
biggest economy in the world
No no...l care...
Now for any normal person...
normal 
ike...for example me...
l-low can you call yourself
normal so confidently...
Hear me out...for any normal person,
a breakfast,
...a lunch and a dinner...
...these three meals is all that is needed
to smoothly do the job next morning...
...but they...on an average
go once in three days!
All through the day
they just eat junk...
...collecting inside
as if a fixed deposit...
...and then one day they
go...and well...do it...
Chchiil!
No no seriously...don't laugh...
and your condition isn't that bad...
...do one thing...just chew
your food like this...lil<e a cow..
....ne><t day you're bound
to have a clear motion...
COW?
Mr. Banerjee have you ever heard a
cow or a buffalo ever getting constipated...
...or doing a hard cow dung...or
loose...think about it...
Tell me
Right....his logic is right
Are you sure you are not a Bengali?
Sir not everything is
a copyright by Bengalis...
You didn't know this...?
No.
There was a railing there?
I think...ya...
That was a new
construction...needs repair
Will get it done...
You're family is
quite interesting...
just because everyone laughed,
don't think everyone is impressed...
...we are very critical people...
Oh I know...some people just
can't like anyone...it's ok...
you think I am like that...?
You are...but...can't
blame you for it...
...actually after a certain
age...one becomes like that...
...difficult to please...
Then don't try to...'please'
OK...
Do you know Piku...
Binod was in secondary when our
father started building this house...
And same year brother
also got a job in ITC...
37, Virginia house,
CHOWRANGEE LANE...
You remember. ..?
Earlier we just had ground floor...
..when they shifted here,
that's when this 1st floor was made...
OK listen...my head...
Can we go out somewhere...?
Ya...I'll just give
dad his medicines...
...the centre of my circumference...
...I feel is this
place...this courtyard...
Then after retirement why
did you settle down in Delhi...'?
you knew your brother doesn't
earn as much as you did...
...to maintain this house...
Can you Keep quiet'?
Why should l?
No no...carry on...she's right.
...a woman as educated as her should
not be stopped from speaking her mind...
...but tell me 
\/Ioni...
...in 1979 who wrote that job application
for you in that BATA company...?
I had my connections there...still
you didn't take up that job...why'?
...because then my salary
would've been more than his...
That's exactly what
I call a low IQ thinking...
...you yourself are responsible
for your frustrations...
...no one else...anyvvays...such
old memories coming back...
remember Binod...after
mother passed away,
her body was kept here...head
that side...
egs here...
And then Piku's mother's
body...that too...
Piku lets go
Where. ..?
We'll just go out...just...
But where?
Kolkata tour
Hey Piku...Don't be late...
Ya I'll come soon...
If you're so emotionally
attached to this place...
...then why do you want to
sell it off? You don't need money...
What? Have you lost it?
Brick by brick I've
constructed this house...
CHAMPA KUNJ can't be sold
ever...it will never be sold!
Our mother's name...CHA
\/IPA...
that's written on it...Got it?!
But brother...
No no no! if you can't maintain
it...I'll give the money...
Turn right from here
Mom used to teach here...then
she met Dad and got married...
And left the job?
Yes
...why don't you
elope and get married...
he's not that bad...
...moreover you need
someone to run away with...
...why didn't you marry...?
Next stop coffee shop
hhuuhh and then by the Ganges
0K6‘!
There used to be a theater
here.....and now a building...
That's what happens usually...
...don't you want
to sell off your house?
One day a building
will come up there too...
I am just being practical...
No no I am not saying
you're wrong...
...may be this is the way forward...
...guess this is
what development is...
...but if you pull your roots out...
...what will remain...
...you know what I mean...
Yes Dad. ..Crataegus
Carbo veg...6-7
drops...yes I am coming.
You guys must not be
having any medical expenses...
...
ooks like you manage
your own treatment...
Ya...
l-low old is you father...must
be at least 70'?
Hmm exact
And the way you're being his doctor,
he'll be around for another 2O
more years...which makes him 90.
touchvvood. ..
And in next 2O years, you too
will become 50...appro><imately'?
L-lmm'?
-so...'?
50...in just taking
care of your father?
one minute...why are
you saying all this...
...you know my situation...?
you know he's dependent on me?
Can't hear or see
properly...shoulcl I leave him'?
No no...
l-low will he manage on his own'?
I am not asking you to leave him..
even I haven't left my mother...
...I am just saying I hope
you realize he is a selfish man...
...no he's not...
Ya he is
and even if he is
.....he's my father...
If he's your father then
why do behave like his mother?
Because Rana, after a certain
age parents can't live on their own,
...they need to be kept alive...
...and that responsibility
is of kids only...
...so if someone
wants to marry me...
He'll have to adopt
your 9O year old kid too...?
Of course...
...will you marry me'?
I haven't gone mad...
Then don't worry about me...
No no I am not worrying
dad used to take us there...to show steamers
...there can you see...there...?
Please come down,
Aunt Chhobi is here...
oh...Bhal<u cia...Pil<u...Binod...
how are you all'?
Wait vvait...am coming

...he always forced me to listen to him
but he made sure death also listened to him
let me tell you
all..clad was in peace.
..he was in no pain.
..and those who know dad..they know he
had just one problem. constipation.
...but that too got
cured before he left..
..so dad's death was a happy
one and I'm going to miss him...
now no one will call
me from this room, Piku..Piku..
Bhashkor da was a
big attention seeker.
...if that man sees Piku is here
all sad, roaming with her hair open...
...he'll come immediately

made a plan of coming back...
...as Piku's kid...
daughter..don't mind me saying
but I need to tell you something.
..but I will pray to
god...if he comes again...
...then he should come
without constipation.
