This is the sun, this is the moon,
this mountain is really the earth,
and this is grandma.
My how splendid...
Hello, Mrs. Yamada.
I've never seen such a magnificent...
Yup, they're my little babies.
What species?
This is a Mino Chrysanthemum, this is...
No, I mean the caterpillar.
No idea.
Grow into a butterfly just as gaudy as that flower.
Mother!
That's our grandma.
And my mother and me, Nonoko.
What am I going to make for dinner tonight...
I know, I'll go for it! Something really special!
What are we having?
We had curry last week. Curry two days ago.
Tonight... Curry!!
What...
And this is my father and my older brother.
What's the use of all this studying, Dad?
Listen, Noboru.
Studying is not about what's useful or not.
The studying that seems useless may turn out to be useful.
On the other hand, it might be that
studying that doesn't seem not useful may not be,
but then studying that seems useless may then be useful.
But when you really need it, it's not about useful or useless...
What are you going on about?
So I still have to study.
MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS
MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS
I get it...
If my father had been smart and really cool,
and my mother had been gorgeous and a great cook,
and our family had been rich, my whole life would've been different.
If at least one of them...
Don't be ridiculous.
If we hadn't married, there'd be no you, and no Nonoko.
Without the two of us, you wouldn't be here.
No, that's wrong.
If I had cooler parents, I'd just be their kid.
How stupid.
Don't you know about stamens and pistils?
You tell him.
You can't choose your parents.
No, I can't accept that. Something's not right.
Because I'm me, Dad's Dad and Mom's Mom.
What is that supposed to mean?
Who am I?
Where did I come from?
Where am I?
Who am I?
I get it...
So, there was a time when Dad and Mom weren't married.
Takashi and Matsuko are off to a great start in their new life.
Let's give them a warm send-off.
Congratulations, Takashi and Matsuko.
I also offer warm wishes to their parents and relatives.
Now, your prospects are boundless,
and you're embarking for the wide open world, under billowing sails.
Life, as they say, has its ups and downs.
At times, the waves may taunt you, tossing you in their swells.
But take heart.
It's hard to stick with it and make it on your own,
but even a couple of losers can survive most things if they're together.
So listen, take my advice and have children as soon as you can.
Children are the best reason for riding out life's storms.
Nowadays people say child-rearing is challenging and difficult,
but we've done it from time immemorial.
Children grow even without parents.
So hold them close to your heart as they crawl, then walk. They'll be fine.
Children make you appreciate your own parents.
Parents may seem to do nothing but order you around,
but they'll baby-sit your kids and sometimes give them toys.
Nowadays young people
turn that saying about appreciating parents to their own advantage.
But I guess that's part of it too.
If things work out, you even get the real estate.
So Matsuko and Takashi,
start looking after your folks!
I hope you know the land is in my name.
Excuse me, mother, but I built this house.
Without land, there's no house.
And we are grateful to you,
but I've worked hard, too.
Your room gets the best light.
Thanks for nothing.
Of course it does. It's on my land.
Besides, why do you always insist you built it by yourself.
I hate to contradict you, but I definitely built...
That's enough!
Both of you.
That's right! What's the point of all this bickering!
Listen to Noboru.
In the end, it'll all be mine.
And what should you fear most on this lifelong voyage?
Wild storms and rip tides?
No. Beware the calm waters, when there's hardly a ripple in sight.
As long as a family holds each other tight, they can somehow
weather the wildest seas.
But calm waters are another story.
The wind dies down, you sigh and relax, loosening your clasp.
But take care, Matsuko and Takashi!
If in the calm you selfishly please only yourselves, you may lose each other.
You'll never see the sharks gathering around you.
And how will you guide your ship?
Without a wind, or even a course?
If you row blindly, right, no, left,
no, right after all, you'll never agree.
You may even wonder why you're stuck on the same boat at all.
Your family's about to fall apart.
Turn right there!
You sure?
Turn left!
Right, right! No, left, left!
Which way!
Oh dear, maybe right.
Which is it!!??
We came so close...
Our turn!
A Family Crisis
Oh, no, this isn't the way.
You should've turned!
No, no, go straight!
No, it's that way, are you crazy?
It's this way, Dad!
Quiet! All of you.
Nonoko's the only one who's quiet.
Hm...she's not here.
What?
Where is she?
Stop the car.
Where did we lose her?
Noboru, weren't you with her?
Yeah, while Dad and I were waiting for you.
Maybe she got bored and wandered off.
No, I remember her on the bench.
I'm so sorry.
What took you so long?
Sorry, I didn't mean to.
I could have done some shopping, too.
I wanted to look at baseball bats.
I'm sure she's still there.
It's all because you kept yelling about how late we were.
Don't blame me. You're the ones who were late.
You all got so excited, you just left poor Nonoko behind.
Like you weren't there yourself, grandma.
We were looking for your flannel underwear!
The store'll close. I'll never make it.
Stop thinking about yourself.
What if something terrible happens to Nonoko?
Something terrible?
You don't mean...kidnapped!
She's so adorable, just like me.
This is no time for jokes!
If only that would work now.
What do you mean, that?
The PTA mantra.
'Don't talk to strangers.'
That's what you teach children?
It's like saying all strangers are thieves.
Nonoko's fine. Those teeth!
Hey, cake! Gimmee some!
Just one bite.
OK!
One chomp of those teeth!
Enough!
Please move, our daughter may have been kidnapped!
We can't even call.
We should've called before.
I told you to buy a cell phone.
You keep quiet!
Oh, Nonoko!
Are you lost?
Huh, so you're waiting for someone?
Who are you waiting for?
Can't you talk?
Then why don't you say anything?
I'm not s'pposed to people I don't know.
I know,'Don't talk to strangers.'
You're very grown-up, because you're careful. You can talk now.
You should hear my story.
My father and mother and grandma and brother all got lost.
Did you lose someone?
My mommy.
Your mommy?
My mommy went away...
I know...there've been a lot of missing parents lately...
But it's only your mom, you'll find her.
Excuse me, this is Toshio Kimura.
Can you please call his mom?
Oh, he's lost?
No he's not, they were separated.
Right.
And your first name, Mr. Kimura?
- Toshio. - Toshio.
Toshio, then.
Wait here a minute, OK?
And you? Are you his sister?
No, no relation.
My whole family's lost.
Poor little, poor little, lost pussy cat...
Stop crying, we're here.
What! She went with her mother!?!
I'm her mother!
Oh, is that so?
How dare you give her to a stranger!
It may not have been her mother, but she was no stranger.
No stranger? Who could it be?
I don't know anyone...
Someone pretending to be friendly...
No, she recognized Nonoko.
That wasn't her mother!
Calm down! And then?
I'm terribly sorry.
Nonoko went off happily with someone who seemed like her mother.
Oh no... Who can it be...
Will you please page Nonoko?
Actually...they went out that exit together.
Not here.
Come on!
That's some family...
Dad, where are you racing off to?
We're chasing it!
What?
The car Nonoko's in!
What kind of car?
We don't even know which way it went!
She'll be fine. Nonoko knew the lady, right?
I bet she took her home.
I'm sure Noboru's right.
Sure, that must be it.
Don't be so sure. You can't trust anyone these days.
Mother!
Don't you think you should notify the police?
The police!
How would we explain?
Make a full confession.
Confession!
That four grown people neglected and abandoned a young girl.
Say, does Nonoko have a key?
Let's go home!
Nonoko!
Nonoko!
Nonoko!
Nonoko!
Not here.
Of course not, it was locked.
Hello.
Oh, thank goodness!
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Thank you! We were looking everywhere for her.
I'm so sorry for all this...
Yes, we'll be right over.
You even made her dinner...
You're so very kind, how can we possibly thank you...
They finally got home.
They're coming right over.
I'm sorry, auntie.
Oh, it's nothing.
I can't wait to hear their side of the story.
Look up and see, the blue skies,
the white clouds
One of these days, it'll all work out
- Next stop Luncheon Court.
What did you call this stop?
Can you stand back, ma'am?
Home Economics Wizard
Oh, dear, it started raining.
The laundry!
Huh?
What's the fuss?
That's right! I'd already brought it in.
You never even hung it up!
I'm going out. Can I get you anything?
Oh! There was something...
What was it... Um...um...
OK, then, I'm going.
It's just that, oh, what was it...
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
What is it!
Um, that is, um...
Why don't you just give up!
Oh, bread!
Get it yourself!
Mom!
Money, money.
I'm home.
I guess Mom's not here.
Wow, noodles.
And the water's boiling.
Great, I'll go ahead and eat'em.
Oh, you're home.
You were hiding!
Say.
The bulb's out.
That's no good. Better change it.
Oh, darn...no spares.
Just switch it with one you don't use.
Up we go.
I'm just borrowing it...
Ouch, it's hot.
Tea.
Me, too.
Me, too.
I'm busy washing the dishes. Get in here one of you!
paper scissors rock
Get your cup out.
The dishes are all yours.
What!
Mr. Tanaka says he's coming over.
What! Oh, no.
Better tidy up a little.
Ouch.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'll say we're spring cleaning!
Marriage Yamada Style
It's on the kitchen table.
No, it's not.
Are you sure? I know I left it.
It isn't here.
Where did you look?
It's a manila envelope that says OKK in red.
Is this it, sir?
Oh, uh...OK. Well,
if it's gone, it's gone.
Hey.
Here.
That's 20 years of marriage for you.
Gimme the paper.
When I'm done.
Impressive.
Can you pick up a few things?
Sure.
Lettuce, cucumber, ham, light bulbs and garbage bags.
I'll make a list.
No, I've got it.
Lettuce, cucumber, ham,
light bulbs and garbage bags, right?
I told you.
It's not exactly like I forgot.
Lettuce...cucumber...
Let's see...
Make up your mind.
Have you decided?
Just hurry up.
I'll take the Shanghai Special.
Me too.
Two Shanghai Specials.
Oh, you're still here?
What do you mean,'still'?
Can't I rest on my day off?
Usually, you're off at Pachinko.
Nope, I'm giving it a rest. How about some tea?
And noodles for lunch.
Yes, dear.
Actually, make that coffee, not tea!
And the bathroom's a wreck.
Clean it up.
And when you go shopping I need cigarettes.
What a pain in the neck!
Honey, honey...
Where's your mother?
Out playing Pachinko.
It's just about to start.
It's not over.
But I was looking forward to it.
No.
It's a movie!
Now nobody can watch.
This is much more fun.
I win!
Hey, Noboru.
Wanna play catch?
Yeah.
Male Bonding
No Trespassing
Wait, the dad's supposed to be the catcher.
Give me a break.
OK, this signal for a curve ball, this for a fastball,
and this for a slider.
Give me a break.
Two outs, bases loaded, you're the relief pitcher.
I'm the starting pitcher type.
Give me a break!
Are you nuts?
The team never even lets you pitch.
That's why I want to start now.
I see. OK, let's see this starting pitcher pitch.
It's still two outs, bases loaded.
What!
OK, pitch.
God damn it!
What are you listening to?
Listening over and over will improve my English.
It's not that easy.
In my experience...
Study!
Study!
Study!
It just doesn't work for me.
I'm not you.
How'bout a drop of sake?
Sure.
But, dear.
Pretty awful, huh?
A little dry.
What did you say!
Have you been...
Noboru!
Noboru!
Hey, Noboru, let's play catch.
Why?
Why...? It's a form of parent-child bonding.
Then it doesn't have to be catch.
I get your point, but...
It's a matter of setting the right stage.
Forget it. Can't be bothered.
Kids these days...
A serious generation gap...
Paternal Supremacy Restored
Don't mix your rice into the soup.
Listen to your father.
Pour the soup over the rice.
Excuse me, father...
What? Got a problem with that?
Oh, suit yourself.
See, the water after the cement.
Um...
Hmmm...
Control those chopsticks. It's rude.
Use your chopsticks with purpose.
That's my plate.
Excuse me.
You bit it, it's yours.
Help me think of an independent study topic.
Think for yourself.
It's independent, free choice.
I know, but I'm coming up blank.
You're free to do anything?
Right, free.
But...
Total freedom makes it tough, doesn't it?
Exactly.
Freedom, huh...
Absolute freedom of choice...
Glorious freedom... I dream of freedom...
But when it comes on a silver platter...
I haven't got a clue what to do...
Now he's a philosopher.
He's probably worrying about his own retirement.
Father as Role Model
The first snow!
Let's take a picture in it!
Why?
You're hardly children anymore.
Shut the door. It's cold.
Where's the camera?
In the top drawer.
Is not!
You should know where it is.
This is the best part...

Yamada Family Chronicles
Happy New Year
New Year's Cards
Ready!
Go!
Mine, mine,
Mother's, Matsuko's, Nonoko's...
31 seconds! A new record.
Not bad.
The Thick of Winter
Time to get up.
Dad, can you get me some cake?
Coke for me.
The tangerines, too.
And the stove needs kerosene.
Thank you!
Spring Showers
Can you bring my umbrella?
Your father needs his umbrella at the station.
Why me? I'm studying.
You should go. Walk in the rain with your man.
I just don't have the energy today.
But...
Noboru! You go, please.
Make Nonoko go.
Forget it! I'll buy one.
Pick up some pork, too?
No Way!
Strange... Where's Noboru's sock...
Nonoko's pajamas and Dad's towel?
Pajamas? Socks?
And his towel.
Hey, wait...
This means...
I knew it!
The Black Hole!
The Perfect Combo
Maybe we'll order sushi in for dinner...
Oh, what a waste of money! I'll make the sushi.
Just as I hoped...
Say, mother...
Sushi's not interesting. I thought I'd go gourmet.
I see...So what is it?
Beef Stroganoga...
Don't cook what you can't spell.
Well, excuse me!
It's Beef Stroganoff, right?
You knew all along.
I know very well.
Beef Stroganoga is just the Strogaffgaff of beef.
Whatever, just make it.
Darn. I was really counting on sushi.
No good. I screwed it up. Order the sushi.
Breakfast of Champions
Wow, miso soup, fried egg and seaweed.
A real Japanese breakfast.
Well, actually...
Nonoko's leftovers?
Yesterday's soup?
Extra seaweed from lunch?
Precisely!
Today's your lucky day.
Hardly!
Take care.
Matsuko...
When's lunch, Matsuko?
What are you talking about? We just ate.
You're too young to be senile.
You sure...?
The noodles, a few... Oops!
I ate them all myself...
Hey!
What's for dinner?
Shabu shabu.
We have it all the time.
Shabu shabu's perfect for winter.
OK, help yourselves.
This way, she doesn't have to cook.
Cold noodles for lunch again?
Cold noodles for lunch again?
That's what we had yesterday!
And the day before.
That doesn't make sense!
And again tomorrow!?
Noodles! What else?
Lots of free ginger in the garden to go with it.
Ginger Morning
The ginger's good in miso soup.
Yes, though they do say it makes you forgetful.
Oh dear. He left his bag.
He's bound to notice. He can't be that dumb.
Right.
Oh, no, I forgot...
...to take of my pajamas!
I'm off.
OK.
Have a nice day.
I'm off.
My shoes!
Mom, look!
Dad!
What's all the fuss!
My train!
I'll be late!
Be careful.
I'm off to school.
Off you go...
Can't even close the door behind them.
What's this?
Oh, Nonoko forgot her lunch.
She needs it by noon?
Sure, but...
Fine, I'll take it to her when I go shopping.
That'll really be a help.
I'm off.
OK. Thank you.
What's this?
Oh, no, she's forgotten her purse and everything.
She'll be back.
Watch the house, OK?
Oh no! I left the kettle on.
Mrs. Yamada, delivery!
Are they out?
No, they're in.
Oh, Mrs. Yamada.
Oh, I did turn it off.
Were you robbed?
Here's your package.
Oh, thank you.
Your seal...?
Oh, sorry.
Let's see... Where do I keep it?
It's in the back of the second drawer.
Oh, goodness...
Always a pleasure.
Thank you.
I delivered Nonoko's lunch.
Why mother, I thought you were going shopping.
Oops, I forgot.
Too much ginger...!
Regret
Say...
Is it Mahler...
I didn't know she was a classical music fan...
Art is Brief Life is Long
They're in full bloom.
I wonder how many more times I'll see the cherry blossoms.
Don't be silly, mother. You're only 70.
Maybe 30 more...
