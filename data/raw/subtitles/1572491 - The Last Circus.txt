Who's that?
I'm not expecting visitors.
It's the sad clown!
I painted his face!
- Damn them.
- Not again!
- What do we do?
- The dress routine, okay?
Hey, blue face!
Okay, show's over!
If you can carry a weapon,
get into the trucks!
You've been recruited
into the 11th Division
of the Republican Army
commanded by Col. Enrique Lister!
Hey, can't you see we're working here?
The place is full of children.
Jesus wept!
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy?!
When he just barges in here
as if he runs the place?
Actually, I do run this place.
And you, clown,
are coming with us.
If you're not with us,
you're with the rebels!
Are you with the rebels,
clown?
I'm not with anyone.
I'm working.
Listen to him. Always joking!
Tell him you're joking.
Joking? I tell you, this damned
war's a joke! A bad one!
Jesus, Manuel!
Apologize.
Why should I apologize to anyone?
Especially this jumped-up cretin,
hiding behind his gun...
I like your friend.
He's got balls.
But balls alone don't win wars!
You need discipline, dammit!
Right, then.
Suit yourselves.
If you're up for it, follow me.
Let's get this show on the road!
What about the animals?
I want to go with you!
Wait for me
at Aunt Angeline's house.
Hurry, hurry!
THE LAST CIRCUS
Open up!
Jesus wept!
Hats off!
What's this?
- Can't you see it's a woman?
- But, the beard...
Christ!
On your way, lady.
Right...
Here they come!
- Hurry up, they're here!
- Okay, damn it!
Right.
Here's the plan.
We open that door and kill
the people on the other side.
Otherwise, they'll kill us.
Simple as that.
With this?
What?
Think it's a toy, do you?
No, but...
You, clown... give him your rifle.
When those fascist bastards
are eating your guts,
you'll be eating your words,
you useless prick!
Hand-to-hand combat
is the key to survival.
- Any objections, clown?
- No.
Good man.
- I like you.
- Just one question.
- What?
- Can I change clothes?
No.
A clown with a machete...
You'll scare the shit out of them.
Let's go!
Show 'em what you're made of!
Bastards!
Let's get 'em!
Holy shit!
C'mon, clown.
Motherfuckers!
I can't see anything.
Am I wounded?
Attention!
Salute!
At ease!
Stop.
Leave him.
So this is what wiped out
my whole regiment?
Very funny.
Now the real fun begins.
Ready!
Load!
Aim!
Fire!
Off limits, kid.
Go back to your parents.
I can't find my dad.
Listen, kid...
You'd best go home.
I want to see my dad.
How do you know
he's a prisoner?
He didn't do anything.
He worked in the circus.
You're the clown's kid?
Will he be shot?
Long live the Republic!
Long live the circus!
Dad.
I told you to go
to Aunt Angeline's house.
I want to be with you.
Listen.
There's nothing to worry about.
I doubt they'll kill me.
We're being kept prisoner.
Honest?
They need labor.
Workers.
It's okay.
A month from now,
we'll be together,
eating a nice Sunday roast.
You'll see.
Come on, time's up.
THE WAR IS OVER!
LONG LIVE SPAIN!
Dad.
You look awful.
That's funny.
They treat us like royalty.
Don't say that.
My poor son.
Life's been cruel to you.
You never knew your mother,
your dad's going to die in jail...
One day you'll be free.
You're here for a reason, you said.
So they say.
We're going to build a cross.
A huge cross.
It can't be worse than this.
What do you want to be
when you grow up?
Why do you ask?
A clown?
Of course.
Like you, Granddad, everyone.
A funny clown?
Yeah. To make kids laugh.
No.
You should be a sad clown.
Why?
Because you've suffered too much.
Son, you'll never be funny.
You were never a kid.
Since childhood
you've faced death.
Your lot is to be the sad clown,
with bushy eyebrows
and a little saxophone.
The funny clown's sidekick,
who laughs at his jokes.
If I can't make people laugh,
no one will ever love me.
Don't say that.
Wait.
There's a way to be happy,
to thwart your fate.
How? What can I do?
Revenge.
Ease your pain with revenge.
Revenge!
Come on, dammit!
What are you doing?
Watch out!
Run for it!
Run!
Dad!
You little bastard!
Colonel, your eye...
Shut up.
INAUGURATION OF
THE VALLEY OF THE FALLEN
Franco inaugurates the temple on the
20th anniversary of the victory...
25 YEARS OF PEACE
Our fellow countryman, Angel Cristo,
is regarded as one of the best
lion tamers in the world.
Have you seen them?
Pompoff and Teddy's cousins.
They're great.
And no make-up.
Each to his own style.
Pass me a hairpin.
Look.
One, two, three.
Slick, eh?
Been in the job long?
No. My dad and granddad
were clowns, but it's my first time.
Got to start somewhere.
- Do you make kids laugh?
- No.
No?
No.
Too bad.
Well, not every gag
has to be a side-splitter.
Maybe your humor's more intellectual.
No, it's not that.
I'm a sad clown.
I'm not funny.
You're right.
- Then you're doing just fine.
- You think so?
Sad? You couldn't
look any sadder.
David the trapeze artist.
Hi.
- Manolo the strong man.
- Welcome.
Our zebra.
Well, painted donkey.
Tightrope walkers
and my animals.
The circus boys. We can have a drink
here later. When we get paid.
Ramiro!
How do I look?
Fantastic!
The Ghost Biker.
They changed his bike.
You sure?
It's not too flashy?
Ghosts are supposed to be flashy.
Have you tried the turbo?
It needs adjusting.
Is that the new guy?
Hi. Javier.
What do you do?
Sad clown!
He gets a snazzy outfit.
Why won't they let me wear
sequins?
Because you're a tough guy!
You're the Ghost Biker!
You wear leather!
Like Marlon Brando
and Charlton Heston!
Charlton Heston wore leather?
Puri, come here!
- Have you fed them?
- They're your dogs.
- Mine?
- I wanted a seal.
- We can't afford seals.
- One would have been enough.
Ignore him, he's a pain.
- A seal and a ball.
- You haven't got any balls either.
Don't mind him.
- Always barking.
- Who, me?
No, the dogs.
And they sleep with us.
Do you have to tell him
our life story?
It's true.
They sleep in our bed.
That's not normal.
- Come here.
- Let's go.
The turbo, it needs adjusting!
Have you met my elephant?
I haven't had time,
I was getting ready...
This is Princess.
She's a sweetie.
She gets jealous
if she sees me with women.
Your outfit...
she must have thought...
Beautiful, isn't she?
Careful, she belongs to someone else.
Your boss, no less.
I'm sick of fucking midgets!
They're gross.
Bandy legs, oversized heads...
- Every circus has midgets.
- Mine doesn't.
This isn't your circus.
It's mine.
Are you sure?
Sergio, you've no right
to talk to me like this.
Fire me. What are you waiting for?
We'll talk later.
Anytime.
And then we'll settle things.
I've told him a million times.
This circus doesn't need midgets.
He never listens.
What do you want?
I'd like you to meet Javier.
He's our new sad clown,
starts tomorrow.
You into kids?
Excuse me?
I don't mean kiddie porn.
Do you like working with them?
Are you patient, kind?
I'll do what you tell me.
Not good enough!
Kids need care and understanding.
You have to become one.
He's like a little boy.
Aren't you?
With his chubby cheeks.
So, tell me.
Why do you want to be a clown?
Think.
Spit it out!
What did I ask you?
Why do you want to be a clown?
You must have a reason.
People don't just become clowns.
Let's see.
Because life scares you?
Your parents were clowns?
You like being humiliated?
What about you?
Because if I weren't a clown,
I'd be a murderer.
Me too.
You're all we've got.
You start tomorrow.
Welcome to the circus, kid.
Who invited him?
You?
Yeah, he doesn't know anyone...
The dogs love him.
They want to hump him.
Reminds me of the joke about
the father in the maternity ward.
- Heard it?
- No.
It's hilarious.
Shut it.
The father goes in,
there are babies everywhere,
he's looking for his.
The nurse points to one.
He starts crying with joy.
"My baby... "
The nurse wraps it up
in a little sheet
and shows it to him.
"Oh, my baby, he's so cute... "
And the nurse goes...
Right in the dad's face.
"Oh my God! What have you done?
You killed my baby!
You killed him!"
And the nurse says,
"No, I didn't.
It was born dead. "
"It was born dead!"
Hilarious!
Good one, eh?
"It was born dead!"
So who gives a shit?!
Don't you think it's funny?
I don't get it.
Where was the mother?
What mother?
The mother.
Who said there's a mother?
Shouldn't there be a mother?
The father's there but...
He spoiled my appetite.
No bringing cretins to dinner.
They eat on their own.
- Don't get upset.
- I will if I want.
- You've had a lot to drink...
- I'll drink what the fuck I want!
- Sergio...
- Shut up!
Sweetie, don't start...
Don't start?
I'll start if I want.
- It was a sick joke!
- Really?
Think so? Sick?
You didn't like it?
Well I think it's funny!
And I decide what's funny around here.
I'm the clown!
The kids come to see me!
I'm your meal ticket, pricks!
Me!
I decide what's funny around here!
Goddammit!
Jesus!
We were having a nice time.
Right, Andres?
Ramiro?
We were talking.
Right, Sonsoles?
In harmony, relaxed...
Having a conversation...
And it all gets fucked up because
some idiot doesn't get the joke.
There's no mother, you got that?
Anyone for dessert,
or straight to coffee?
What's for dessert?
Fruit salad,
rice pudding, homemade flan,
- and whisky ice cream.
- Rice pudding.
- Black coffee.
- Rice pudding.
Black coffee.
Coffee with milk, not too strong.
Coffee with milk.
I'd like your special homemade
flan with whipped cream
and a coffee with milk,
not too strong, with sweetener.
What are you having?
Coffee with milk, please.
Hey, Ramiro.
What does a pessimist do
when opportunity knocks?
I have no idea.
Complain about the noise.
Complain about the noise!
I've got a great one.
An Englishman, a Frenchman
and a Spaniard...
That's ancient.
This one is different.
Natalia, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Don't worry.
- Is he always like that?
- Only when he drinks.
Is that often?
Every night.
Sorry.
Must go or he'll be really mad.
Who are you?
The sad clown.
- I start tomorrow.
- What's your name?
Javier.
You're in for it.
You think so?
Know what happened
to the last sad clown?
No.
You don't want to.
- Natalia, what are you doing?
- I'm cleaning up!
Always keeping me waiting...
Can you forgive me?
I'm sorry, my love.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
You like that, eh?
Want me to leave you senseless, eh?
Do you?
Stop hitting her...
Don't hurt her...
- Boss, listen...
- What's your problem?
We haven't rehearsed.
- No rehearsal, no jump.
- Don't exaggerate.
The new turbo
isn't adjusted for my weight.
- And the ramp...
- Come on, come on.
You'll be great!
How's the new guy?
So far, so good. The kids laugh
when he gets hit with the piano.
Success!
A bit green, but he'll do.
He looks serious, scared of me.
I like that.
The kids laugh.
A hit! A real hit!
Congratulations.
Keep it up and I'll pay you double.
Time to announce this guy.
- I'm not going on.
- Shut up and get in there.
How was I?
Spectacular.
The way you stared him down
while he threw pies at you.
And as you talked to the kids
and he set fire to your butt...
You didn't even flinch.
That studied passivity
reminds me of Buster Keaton!
- Was Natalia watching?
- Of course.
You were wonderful.
Take me to dinner in Madrid later
and we can talk.
- About what?
- Just to get to know each other.
Sounds nice, but maybe
it's not a good idea...
- He'll be there. Eight o'clock?
- Perfect. Eight o'clock.
Eight o'clock, don't forget.
HOUSE OF HORROR
Look, what did I tell you?
What a place!
Look at their faces.
- This is Blue Beard.
- His beard isn't blue.
You're right, his beard...
isn't blue.
Natalia, you have to leave him.
You know the story?
What story?
Blue Beard had many wives.
He gave them each
a bunch of keys
and told them,
"Go wherever you like,
but this little key
opens a door
I don't want you to open. "
Right.
So you're saying...
you opened the door.
Yes.
And I love what's inside.
You're not like other men I know.
No?
You don't want
to take advantage of me.
Of course not.
You're too scared to even touch me!
It's late.
We'd better get going.
Come on.
We shouldn't be seen
arriving together.
I was about to say the same thing.
For your sake...
Anyway...
See you.
She's cheating on me.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- What?
You think I'm making it up?
I'm going to look for her.
If she's not home, I'll kill her.
Sergio, wait until morning.
She's probably asleep.
- You know something.
- No, I don't.
Something's going on, Ramiro.
If you hold out on me,
I'll cut your balls off.
Don't, Sergio.
We've had too much to drink.
Call her in the morning
with a clear head.
What are you doing?
What's going on?
This is wrong.
- Are you scared?
- Yes.
Fear spices things up.
You're like a kid.
I was never a kid.
I don't understand.
Who's Blue Beard?
That's not the point.
- But you were in her trailer?
- Yeah.
So what's the problem?
She's toying with me.
She just wants to be friends.
Wake up, sunshine.
If a woman invites you to be her
friend, you'll never shag her.
Sure, like you're an expert.
I was married, Javier.
- She left you?
- No.
Princess killed her.
She sat on her,
crushed her to death.
Right.
I told you she hates
seeing me with other women.
Listen, kid.
A word in your ear:
you're doing great.
- You think?
- Yeah, you're very good.
You can tell it's in your blood.
- Have they fixed the turbo?
- Yeah, don't be a pain.
- You sure? If it happens again...
- Come on.
- My father...
- I met him once when I was a kid.
- He was great.
- Yeah.
- Remember the door routine?
- Of course.
Were you with my girl last night?
What?
When I got home, she wasn't in bed.
I heard you went out with her.
Maybe you know where she was.
I didn't see her.
No. I didn't see her.
I don't know where she was.
I was... doing things...
I might have run into her,
I don't remember...
Javier. That's your name, right?
- Yeah.
- Look.
Natalia means everything to me.
I'd do anything for her.
Anything, Javier.
Javier.
Listen.
Sometimes I drink too much
and lose control.
But I'm not a bad person.
I love Natalia deeply.
True love.
True love, Javier.
You're on.
Let's go.
What a team!
Now it's elephant time.
What do elephants do?
What do elephants do?
He's different
when things are going well.
You mean he beats you less.
Don't say that.
I love him too much sometimes.
You can say that again.
Any other girl
would run away from that.
Look, Natalia.
It's not normal.
Have you never felt trapped
by a love
you know might kill you...
but you still can't help yourself?
Yes, every day.
This circus will be the end of me.
You see?
We're two of a kind.
If I hadn't met him...
If he disappeared...
Don't even joke about that.
We'd be sunk without him.
He's the best clown I've had in years.
Look at him.
The kids adore him.
Who wants to ride with me?
We're a hit!
We'll be in the paper!
We're staying an extra week.
Good work!
- Can he have a ride?
- Sure.
And now the sad clown will
hop on with this baby
for a ride on the elephant!
Let's hear it for the sad clown!
- It's too far.
- Hurry up, dickhead.
Come on.
A big hand for the sad clown!
Pass him over.
- It's too far.
- Come on.
The sad clown's got cold feet!
Pass me the kid.
The elephant's moved away.
The sad clown is scared!
- I can't reach.
- Come on!
I can't reach.
She needs to come closer.
Do it, stupid!
Give me the kid!
I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry, love.
If a child gets hurt, I'll kill you.
You got that?
Children are our livelihood.
You okay?
Better. Panic's over.
- Will you take me to the fun fair?
- Where?
Ferris wheel, carousel,
cotton candy...
Paris...
We can dine out, have fun,
like the other day.
Are you crazy?
What about Sergio?
Sergio got drunk, went to bed at five.
He won't be up until morning.
You sure?
Not entirely.
He could wake up,
come looking for us, find us...
and kill us both!
- You have to take risks in life.
- Yeah, but...
There are risks and risks...
My baby's scared!
Why are you doing this?
Why me?
Am I a joke to you?
No.
So?
I don't know.
With you it's different.
I feel safe.
Thanks.
- Hey, listen...
- What?
I know for you this is like
a day out with your nephew,
but I want you to know
these things really affect me.
What do you mean?
That I could end up loving you.
Loving me? How much?
A lot. More than a lot.
Don't!
I'd rather never see you again
than be treated like this.
Don't you see?
You're the only one
who stood up to him.
You didn't laugh at his jokes.
That's what I call a real man.
Cock of the roost, eh?
Full of yourself.
Sergio, it's my fault.
I made him come...
No, Sergio!
No, Sergio! Let her go!
Don't worry.
I'll be back for you
when I've left her in the car.
I won't let you take her.
This is good.
We can use it in our act.
You stand up to me
and I beat the shit out of you.
You say you love her,
but one day you'll kill her.
What do you know about love?
Lie there.
I want a prize.
Halt!
A prize!
Stop! You'll kill him!
You'll kill him!
I want a prize!
Stop! Police!
Let me go!
The bell rang!
I want my prize!
I want my teddy bear!
I want my prize! Let me go!
The bell rang!
Yesterday, in the High Court,
the hearing began
of the case against Eleuterio
"el Lute" Sanchez Rodriguez,
and his brothers Manuel and Raimundo,
alias "Lolo and Toto,"
charged with parole breaking,
robbery, aggression,
homicide, fraud,
illegal arms possession,
kidnapping and terrorism.
The prosecution is asking for
a sentence totaling 3,291 years.
Eleuterio's brothers
are being tried...
Are you related to Javier Granados?
- No.
- His girlfriend?
- No, co-worker.
- We've stabilized him.
He has internal bleeding
and several broken ribs.
- He's just come 'round.
- Can I see him?
Just for five minutes.
He's very weak.
Don't go, gorgeous.
Be quiet.
Dad?
No.
It's Natalia.
- The circus acrobat.
- Natalia.
I was dreaming about my father.
He wanted to tell me something.
But I can't remember.
I'm sorry, Javier.
I shouldn't have gone out with you,
or even spoken to you.
When he gets back, I have to be there
to calm him down.
Calm him down?
You're going back to him?
Javier, I'm scared.
If I'm not there...
and he finds you...
So it's for my sake?
Get some rest.
Answer me, Natalia!
Are you doing it
for my sake?
The doctor said you're weak.
I'll kill him!
Really? For my sake or yours?
Are you crazy?
He almost killed you,
don't you see?
It's over, Javier.
We can't see each other again.
The police have released him
by now.
He's not like you.
He's an animal.
An animal...
Remember your father, son!
Where are you going?
I can see your ass!
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?
Where are you going?
- He lives here.
- You don't understand.
Look at him, for God's sake.
Where is she?
She's here with him!
You need to get as far away
as you can.
We'll pay your bus fare.
Whatever.
Leave him alone.
He knows what he's doing.
- Really?
- You're a coward.
Me, a coward? Bloody cheek!
Javier, don't do it.
- Get off!
- Forget her! You can't stop it!
Out of my way!
You won't have to worry
about him any more.
What's wrong?
You're free.
I freed you from the monster.
- Where are you going?
- What have you done?
What have you done?
Christ!
We have to call the police.
He's alive. But not for long.
Halt! Stop, police!
What's this?
He's badly hurt.
Who are you?
Do you know what time it is?!
It's those circus people.
I only treat dogs
and farm animals.
I know nothing about elephants.
What?! For God's sake!
Use your eyes!
We must act fast or he'll die.
My God! What happened?
Was he mauled by a tiger?
His face is badly disfigured!
The man needs a hospital!
There's no time.
He's losing too much blood.
Don't get involved.
It could ruin you.
Do what you can.
I'm begging you.
What if he doesn't make it?
What if he dies here?
I could...
stitch and cauterize his wounds,
but I can't make any promises.
- I don't have the right equipment here.
- This is madness.
We shouldn't attend to people at night,
or even open the door!
I'm telling you, send them away!
I have a nose for these things!
Shut up, woman!
Let me think.
I don't know, really...
I don't want to be
held liable for this.
Natalia.
It's up to you.
Is he your husband?
No... I'm... I'm...
- Do you assume liability?
- Yes.
Do what you can.
Whatever it takes.
Boil some water, bring me the chloroform
and get everything ready.
Get what ready?
We're only equipped
for delivering piglets!
What are you doing?
Tuck the teeth inside...
This is madness!
Shut up!
You're mad.
You'll go to hell, all of you!
All of you! And you...
You'll be the first.
This is all your fault!
You don't fool me, lovey.
- Believe me.
- I'm doing this wrong.
Pull it tighter...
Shut up, dammit!
Natalia!
Where are you going?
Monster! Monster!
That can't be me.
It can't be!
Once again, Eleuterio Sanchez,
Spain's most wanted criminal,
has given the police the slip.
After his arrest in Seville,
"el Lute" was taken to
the prison hospital in Madrid
where he was treated
for multiple injuries.
It's over.
No news of Javier.
Or Sergio.
Nothing?
Nothing.
The tour's been cancelled.
I can't pay the bills.
I have to close down.
Waiter! A small coffee,
please.
- Hot or cold milk?
- Warm.
We'll just have to do
something else.
Any ideas?
No.
Why don't you sell the animals?
They're not mine.
I've got nothing.
Just debts.
Then we'll just have to make beds
or scrub floors.
Don't worry, love.
I'm sure
we'll come up with something better.
No. I don't believe it!
He looks like an animal.
Eh, Colonel?
Put him in the Land Rover.
In you go!
Come on, move it!
We got lucky today, Anselmo.
We bagged a unique specimen.
The biggest boar
in the whole area.
Take them to the stables.
- Both of them?
- Both of them.
Hello?
Enrique! How are you?
No, impossible.
You can't come.
Tomorrow's the hunt.
I've a lot to prepare.
I got a call from Franco's residence.
He wants to be alone, to relax.
Bye, Enrique.
Colonel...
What do I do with that man?
Leave him for now.
Put him to work tomorrow.
He's weird.
He doesn't speak.
Maybe he doesn't know how.
He knows all right.
Off you go.
General.
My dear Salcedo,
so good to see you again!
Everything is ready for the hunt.
The sooner I smell gunpowder, the better.
After you, General.
Come on!
Get to work, like everyone else!
Get a move on, dammit!
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you, eh?
The bird in your mouth!
Come on!
Good boy.
What on earth are you doing?
What's the poor man done
to be treated that way?
A long time ago,
he made a fool out of me.
He likes to joke around.
It runs in his family.
Nobody deserves that.
It's not Christian, Salcedo.
We've been friends for years, but
there are things about you I don't like.
Right...
Seems I hit the mark this time!
Don't tolerate this, lad.
You shouldn't put up
with such humiliation.
Get up now.
Call a doctor!
Take him away!
You're the best thing in my life.
Even if I never tell you.
If you're away, I'm sad.
I miss you at night,
I miss you during the day.
My heart is happy
And full of joy.
My heart is happy
Ever since you entered my world.
And I thank life
And pray to God
you'll always be with me.
I want you to know
I never loved like this.
That my life began
When I met you.
Come on. Move it!
I was wondering...
Come on. Inside!
You bit Franco.
I could get to like you after all.
Shame you're to be shot.
Get some rest.
Salcedo wants to do it himself.
You lucky devil!
The Day of Wrath is here.
You will be my Angel of Death.
Save me from Evil and fulfill
your destiny, my beloved.
A gunshot wound.
An accident.
We can't say a lunatic bit him.
Like vermin, he'll be put down.
And that's that.
Not until the Generalissimo
has left the castle.
Now's a bad time, Salcedo.
And you know it.
CAUSTIC SODA
Weirdo!
Weirdo! Weirdo!
Hey, weirdo, it's time.
What are you dressed up as?
A priest or a lady?
If the colonel sees you dressed
like that, he'll have a fit.
I don't know where you came from,
but, I must admit, I didn't expect this.
You're off your bloody rocker!
What did you do to your face?
Hey, blondie... where's the fire?
Stay with us, gorgeous.
Who are you running from?
I'll never forgive myself.
All right. But the press
mustn't get hold of this.
I thought we controlled the press.
We're losing international support,
the opposition is getting organized.
Our contact in the north has warned us
of a plot to assassinate
Admiral Carrero Blanco.
We know there's
a terrorist cell in Madrid.
Don't believe everything you hear.
What the hell is that?
Damned bastard!
You haven't got the balls!
Shoot me, motherfucker!
Life goes on, eh? Like the song says.
Where's your boyfriend?
I don't know what you're talking about.
A better lay than me, is he?
Hung like a horse?
Leave me alone!
Of course! Sorry.
How vulgar of me!
You two don't fuck.
You read books.
Does he read you bedtime stories?
Help me.
It hurts, Natalia.
Please, help me.
Help me, Natalia!
Five omelette sandwiches,
two Cokes and three orange Fantas.
I want lemon!
Two Cokes, two orange Fantas
and a lemon Fanta.
I don't want omelette,
I want chorizo!
One chorizo,
four omelette, two orange Fantas
and a lemon Fanta.
What about the Cokes?
Don't order me anything.
Just a glass of water.
- Didn't you say you were hungry?
- Not any more.
- I need to pee.
- Then go pee!
A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED
Ballad of the sad trumpet
For a past that died...
Who's Raphael?
A great singer and a great person.
He looks like a woman.
He's not a woman, he's a clown.
Clowns make children laugh.
That's what you want,
isn't it? To make us laugh?
You don't scare me.
We forgot Miki!
All the weeping of the trumpet...
- What are you doing?
- Escaping. He's after me.
You have work here.
We need to call the police.
And get him arrested, like Javier?
Make up your mind.
You say he wants to kill you.
- Why are you bringing up Javier?
- He did all this to save me.
- Are you in love with him too?
- He was nice to her.
Who asked your opinion?
I need someone who makes me laugh,
who protects me...
And who fucks you senseless,
pleasures you, talks dirty?
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
- What shall I do with the animals?
- Find an open space and release them.
You're right.
Give them some fresh air.
- Sorry, I've had enough.
- Natalia, wait!
- Where are you going?
- I can't let her go alone!
- Let's call the cops first.
- Andrés!
Damn!
- Jesus!
- Where is she?
She just left.
The back way.
Quiet! Don't tell him anything.
Javier, please, don't do anything crazy!
It's me! Take it easy!
What? Don't you fancy me now?
Jesus! Get a load of you!
Natalia! Get out of there!
Where are you off to,
dressed like that?
Look at his face.
Vying with me, eh?
Step away so I can kill him, Natalia.
Do it.
Go with him.
Natalia, it's me.
What's wrong?
So...
do you get it now?
It's me she prefers.
No, Natalia, tell me
that's not true. Please.
You said you felt safe with me.
You asked me to save you,
to be your Angel of Death.
You're making a fool of yourself.
An utter fool.
You're just a crybaby.
A blubbering clown.
Halt!
Show some pity. He's sick.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
Oh, God. Please!
Don't move! Release him!
Run, Javier, run!
She loves you, I know it!
She loves you!
Where are you going?
Fucking cops!
Suck my cock! But one by one.
Now you can beat the shit
out of me, if you want.
No, please, for God's sake, let him go!
No, please, let him go!
Let my man go.
LATE NEWS
In the wake of the "el Lute" affair,
a madman in a clown suit now
has the nation on tenterhooks.
Javier Granados,
dubbed by the media as "The Sad Clown,"
escaped, aided by fellow circus workers.
He is wanted for at least three murders
and armed robbery.
Until yesterday I was just a bum.
Today I'm guarding
your dreams of love.
I love her to death...
You two!
You're to blame!
Why?
Why did she go with him? Why?
She raises a tower
from here to the sky.
She puts wings on me
and helps me climb it.
In a hurry, in a hurry.
I love her to death.
Ballad of the sad trumpet
For a past that died.
And weeps.
And moans.
How it weeps.
Javier, listen. That whore's
not for you. Forget her.
You're a good man.
Give yourself up.
You can't go around shooting people.
Don't listen to him, son.
Go after her and kill that bastard.
He doesn't deserve her.
She doesn't love me.
I'm not funny.
Humor is for the weak.
If they don't laugh,
scare them shitless!
You'll see it works.
How dare you talk like that
to your own son?
- Kindly get out of my movie.
- Hands off!
Who's this creep, son?
What's he doing in your head?
I like the way he sings.
Remember who your father is.
Remember your destiny.
There's only one way to be happy.
Excuse me.
We can't see.
Could you sit down?
We can't see.
- What's with him?
- Never mind. We'll move.
Why should we? He can
sit down like everyone else.
Look at the state of him.
He's not all there.
- So what, dammit?
- Be careful!
Hey, I asked you nicely, okay?
I just want to watch the film
with my girlfriend in peace...
How is everybody?
Greeeat!
I'm told there's a ghost
who's chasing me
but I don't know where he is.
- On your back!
- Where?
Where?
On your back!
- Where?
- Behind you!
Where? Where?
Where's...?
For God's sake!
- Look at his face!
- Get away from my son, you hear?
- Get away!
- We're leaving, okay?
Is this the guy the police are after?
- No, it's not me.
- Call security!
That's someone else, not me.
Natalia, tell them.
Tell them it's not me.
Kids don't love me anymore!
Is that all that bothers you?
It bothers me that you clammed up!
Why didn't you tell the truth?
That you all did this to me.
Forget it, Sergio.
Forget it?
That's enough!
Your clown days are over!
No...
not that.
It's all I know, Natalia.
Natalia, my love,
I don't know how to do anything else.
Please, Natalia!
Who are you?
You don't have the guts.
What circus are you from?
CARRERO BLANCO DIES
A huge crater in the road
and serious damage to nearby buildings
were the result of
the powerful terrorist bomb
which killed President
Carrero Blanco in Madrid.
Let's try to speak
to some of the eyewitnesses.
- Good morning.
- I only heard it.
- You what?
- I just heard it.
- Where were you?
- In bed.
- What did you hear?
- A terrible explosion.
What did you think?
That it was a car exhaust
or a welder's gas cylinder...
But from the balcony I saw
people running, a taxi driver...
Look, I'm still in my pajamas.
Where were you?
I was on an errand when I saw
an ice-cream van, just there,
driven by a clown or a priest...
- Amazing.
- Imagine, a clown right there.
He hopped in the van and sped off.
OFFICIAL BULLETIN
As Spain mourns the loss
of one of her most loyal
and faithful servants,
I wish to address the nation.
Where are you going, shorty?
The garage. I'm having
the turbo changed on my bike.
Right, the show must go on, eh?
Well, yeah.
But most of all I miss it.
You like flying on a motorbike, eh?
I don't have a bike,
but the flying can be arranged.
I don't know anything!
Yes, you do.
- It's Ramiro who talks to him!
- So you do know something.
Jesus!
Let me go! I'd rather
fall than see your face.
Yeah, you'd get off on that.
Where did Ramiro take the animals?
I don't know.
I'm not telling you anything.
He talked to Javier, and they
took them to a hideout, right?
Where? An abandoned
warehouse, a basement...?
A cave?
Who told you?
You did, just now.
So, a cave, big enough
to house them all, right?
Tell me!
I didn't say that.
- It's not a cave.
- All right, it's not a cave.
But similar, dug out in stone?
- A cave.
- I didn't say anything.
- Is it a church?
- No, it's not a church!
A church like a cave...
dug out of the rock!
You're in for a surprise.
Look what I've got for you!
Get a load of this!
Look!
Shall we dance?
Come here!
Christ!
Your face looks like a battlefield.
What's up?
Cat got your tongue?
If this is a hoax,
you'll answer to the authorities.
He's here.
I know it!
- Cops.
- And more cops.
All this ruckus means Andrés was right.
Puzzles me how the police
found out Javier was hiding here.
Some secret lair!
Everybody knows about it.
- I just want my motorbike back.
- You and that fucking bike!
Bloody bike!
Don't you ever think of anyone
but yourself? Bike, bike, bike!
Can't you see those two are going to
kill each other and Natalia's in danger?
It's hard to dance
in these clown shoes.
I'm sorry about all this,
Natalia, really.
But it's not my fault.
I was told to do it.
Who by?
Raphael, the singer.
There, look.
He told me. Him and my dad.
- I know you don't love me.
- Who told you that? Raphael?
Maybe in time I'll learn
to pretend... to be like Sergio.
You're well on your way.
I'm scared of you too now!
Come back! Come back!
Over here!
We found them.
There are tunnels under the church.
Come on, let's go!
Move it!
What the fuck is this?
A joke?
You're mad, like the other guy!
Like all you who fart around
for a living!
Doing an honest day's work
would stop your bullshit, no messing!
Lazy bastard!
The Valley of the Fallen.
Ever been here?
There are 15 caves here,
full of bodies.
One of these has to be my father.
Some fascists, others reds.
But they all ended up here together.
Death unites people.
Javier, stop this.
I'll do whatever you want.
Just one thing. Desire me,
for my body, like you desire him.
Well, well.
I made her laugh.
No, Javier.
- I didn't mean to. I'm sorry...
- No!
Don't you dare do that again!
Don't you dare feel sorry for me! Ever!
I'd rather you hated me.
I'd like to hate you, but I can't.
I don't love Sergio any more.
I was wrong.
I thought I could live
with you, but not like this...
Like what? Crazy?
You drove me crazy, Natalia!
You're crazy about me?
Is this a declaration of love?
Yes. Yes, it is.
Yes, it is,
because I love you, Natalia!
I'm mad about you!
How sweet!
Can I be the best man?
Run for it!
Head for the cross!
Look!
They'll be killed!
- It's hopeless.
- There's nothing we can do.
We'd have to cross
the police cordon.
I can. I can fly.
Isn't there a single one of us
who isn't completely nuts?
He did have his turbo replaced.
Six cans of pure gas oil,
three parts hydrogen and one part helium.
Like a 747 jet engine.
I can break the sound barrier!
What are you doing?
It's the only way to escape.
Let me. It's my job, remember?
We're escaping together?
Yes, sweetie.
We're escaping together.
- Follow me, let's go!
- Come on!
Get down! Get down!
Relax. It's a piece of cake.
This is too much.
It's not us, it's this country
that's gone to the dogs.
It's like a kick in the balls
losing your girl,
isn't it, eh?
It'll hurt even more
when you hit the ground.
Jump.
Jump, dickhead.
Jump!
I can do it!
Let me get it right
for once, damn it!
I can fly, damn it!
I... can... fly!
Come down, kid!
Watch him! I said watch him!
Otherwise it isn't funny!
See? In the end, I'm the smart one
and you're the dummy.
Who cares if you're funny
when it's time to die?
You think death is a joke?
Come on, clown!
Make me laugh!
Prove you've got a sense of humour!
I don't want you to be like him.
You have to believe me.
Nobody wants you to be funny.
You have to believe me.
I love you, sad clown.
You, come here.
So what now, eh?
Are you happy?
What should I do to you?
This makes you horny, eh?
This is what you wanted, right?
Tell me! Tell me!
They're in here!
Pull him up!
- You too.
- Take them away.
- Come here.
- You're in for it!
We still don't know the motive
of this murder.
Police have arrested two suspects.
There are two bodies.
