Now, are you sure you heard,
uh, Larry correctly?
I'm positive.
I was waiting for someone to say something
but either they didn't hear what I heard
or... they didn't care.
Well… we don't condone
that kind of language so...
we'll conclude they didn't hear.
- But w-what I heard…
- Oh.
I'm sure you've seen that
a couple of the partners around here
are a little old school
but they do generally care about creating
an inclusive and diverse environment.
Seriously?
I mean, no offense but...
- Look.
- Take a look around.
Sister.
I know you're a part of that
"When do we want it? Now!" generation,
but the reality is, no firm is perfect.
We are actively pursuing qualified women
but that takes time…
If we want to hire the right people.
Yeah, of course.
But you know...
James shared with me
the letter he wrote you for UCLA.
And that was quite a letter.
Thank you.
No, don't thank me.
Just know a letter like that carries
a whole lot of weight outside these walls.
That's a win for you.
In the meantime,
let me give a think onto your situation.
Now, I want you to feel protected
in this process.
But sometimes doing a little less is more.
Morning. Fuller Lowes and Silver.
Mark Silver's office.
Sorry, he's just wrapping up a call.
Can we try you back?
James Lowes' office.
He just stepped out. Can I take a message?
James Fuller's office.
Oh, hey, Judy.
He's still in the morning staff meeting,
but I can get him to call you back.
Oh, and, Judy, the caterers
will be with you at 4:00 p.m. to set up.
Happy anniversary.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Shit.
James. Hey, is everything okay?
Wow, you screwed me, Cherie.
You really screwed me.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
I would've come to you first but I...
No, not the HR thing.
I'm firing Larry.
What he said was unacceptable.
You double-booked me.
How am I supposed to have
my anniversary dinner
and a client dinner on the same night?
Double-book?
I didn't realize anything
about a client dinner.
But you knew it was my anniversary, right?
Of course.
I, uh, spoke to Judy earlier.
Look, I don't care how it happened,
I just need you to fix it.
Right. Absolutely.
Oh, I know. Can you take the dinner?
He's my oldest client.
He hates talking law anyway.
Me?
You're both young.
Don't even think about it like work.
Just take him out
for a fun night on the town.
He'll be thrilled.
You'd really be helping me out.
What do you say?
Cherie?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Absolutely.
Ah, there's my girl.
Can you get a babysitter on time?
Yeah, it'll be no worries.
Just… just send me the details.
Oh, shit.
Ooh. No, no.
No, no. No. I need that one.
No, no. No. No, no.
I love you.
Nah, 'cause if you love me
you wouldn't be calling me last minute.
Thank you so much for coming.
You are literally saving my job.
I just couldn't bring myself
to call Trey tonight.
Uh-uh. You need to avoid
all interactions with Trey.
Luze is the best thing
you're gonna get out of that man.
I know. I just can't believe
I messed up like this.
What you mean you messed up?
Girl, real talk? I don't think I did.
Then you didn't. You don't ever mess up.
Yeah, but I can't tell my boss that,
can I?
Just help me fix this, please.
Come on. That's why I'm here.
Let's go.
What says, "Take me seriously
'cause I'm a bright, future lawyer"
but also, "Don't take me too seriously
'cause I'm hell a chill"?
- None of this.
- What?
Maternity jeggings, no.
And please tell this does not have a snap
so you can breastfeed.
Well, I haven't been shopping
since I've had the baby.
Yeah, no shit.
Oh, my gosh. Remember this?
Pre-baby Cherie.
Oh. Come on, red is a power color.
It's not too short.
It's very confident
and I mean, you'll still look sexy.
I'm not about sexy.
Fine, hold on.
You want to keep it professional?
You leave the trench on.
You start feeling him a little
and you want to show off them girls,
you take the trench off.
Okay.
Let me see that pic.
It's on my phone.
Oh, you are definitely coming off
this trench.
For real, it's time for you
to have some fun.
No, okay, listen.
This is business, all right?
It's strictly professional.
I'm going to be in
and then I am going to be out.
Oh, a little, a little in and out, huh?
- A little...
- Stop.
Zip me up.
Damn, you look so good.
Shoot, my car's here.
Okay, um, please don't close my laptop
'cause I'm recording that lecture.
Oh, oh, there's a bottle in the fridge
in case Luze wakes up, okay?
Take my pepper spray.
Really?
He may be fine but he's still a man.
God, please be like the picture.
Please be like the picture.
Cherie.
Uh, yeah.
Um, Ethan?
Well, that's-that's me.
Oh, um...
Oh.
How wonderful finally to meet you.
You, too.
Oh. I'm so sorry.
Please come in. I'm...
Oh. Thank you.
Wow.
This is...
- Come on.
- Oh, sure.
Your place is… I-it's amazing.
I've had a lot of help.
Um, do you want a drink before we leave?
- Uh, sure. That'd be nice.
- Yeah.
What do you drink?
Uh, whatever you're having is fine.
- Um... gin and tonic?
- Sure.
It's actually the only drink I can make.
Two ingredients is about all I can manage.
Thanks.
Um, I'm a bit low on tonic,
so it's mostly gin.
Oh, okay.
I'm sure it's fine.
You can tell a lot about a woman
by what she drinks.
Really?
My mom always said it was the watch.
Oh, yeah?
What kind do you wear?
My mom's.
Oh.
So you're... sentimental.
Yeah.
I like that.
Can I see it?
Um, I-I'm sorry.
Can you excuse me for a second?
Oh, shit.
Uh, I saw you have a telescope.
Oh, you want to try it?
Yeah.
Thanks.
It's very old.
Venus.
The brightest planet.
Named after
the goddess of love and beauty.
Actually, I think that's Jupiter.
You can see its four biggest moons
and, if you look closely,
you can see the Great Red Spot.
Do you want to see?
That's just what I think it is though.
I didn't want to seem like
I was correcting you.
Most impressive moment of my night so far.
You teaching me about astrology.
Astronomy.
Oh, God.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
No, I-I do that.
Please don't apologize.
Never apologize with me.
Two confessions:
I'm actually thrilled I don't have to have
dinner with another lawyer tonight.
James isn't that bad.
Okay, what's the other?
I've looked through your posts
to see where I should take you to dinner.
You did?
In a professional-not-creepy-at-all way.
And what did you find?
No hamburgers, no cheeseburgers,
so I thought you would appreciate
the best sushi in L.A.
Well, you thought right.
You're studying at night, right?
What are you studying?
I'm prelaw at UCLA.
- Mm. A future lawyer.
- Yeah.
Uh, both my mom and grandma were nurses,
so I guess you could say
I went my own way.
My favorite person in the world
was a nurse.
- Really?
- Nurses are the hearts of the hospital.
Well, she's just started talking.
Oh, first word?
Her first word is "wow."
- "Wow."
- Yeah.
It's nice, though.
It-it reminds you
how everything really is "wow."
Ah! Control your fucking dog!
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I'm... Oh.
Um, God, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...
That was...
I'm so sorry. I-I-I-I...
Please sit. Here.
Oh.
Um...
I, um...
That was so uncool.
That was so uncool. I'm so sorry.
God, I didn't mean to scare you.
It's just, I was bitten by a dog
when I was a child,
and 48 stitches.
And-and... and now I...
I am officially a cat person.
Can I say that as a red-blooded adult man?
Uh, sure.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Um...
- Oh, please, feel free.
Uh, it's my babysitter.
I ask her to send her pictures
of my daughter when I'm out.
I bet she's cute.
She is.
Although, I try not to tell her too often.
She hears it enough from strangers.
It's hard not to comment on her looks
when she's this cute.
But...
she also looks very smart...
and clever and funny,
just like her mother.
Thank you.
Cheers.
To the "wow" moments in life.
And really crazy ideas.
Cheers.
Thank you for such a lovely evening.
I could get used to James's life.
Oh.
I don't want this to end now.
- Come in for a drink.
- I would love to.
But I've already booked my car
and I will be very tired in the morning,
and tired and toddler
do not go very well together.
I'm going to set my alarm for...
What time does she wake up?
- 6:30.
- 6:30?
Yeah, if I'm lucky.
Oh, God.
Cancel the car.
One drink,
and I will set the alarm for 6:30
so I have to wake up early, too.
I thought your alarm's
already set for 5:25.
Which is 100% a mistake.
In that case...
Canceled.
One drink.
You know what?
Maybe I should get back.
My babysitter's probably exhausted.
It was the roller skates, wasn't it?
There's nothing less attractive
than a man on roller skates, is there?
It wasn't that.
Another time.
Wait.
She said that I could stay out late.
I'm sure she'll be fine.
Are you sure? Because I don't...
- Honestly, I...
- Honestly, she'll be fine.
- That's a girl, sweetheart.
- What was that?
I said, "I like that."
Help!
Please help!
Help!
Please help!
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Help! Help!
Please!
Please let me in! Please!
Please help me! Let me in! Please!
Please, I need you, I need you...
No. No. No.
No.
Please.
Someone, please.
- That's not a good one.
- It's not?
- No, yeah... -It looks so warm.
- Excuse me.
Please, can I use your phone?
What happened to you?
I was attacked.
I was attacked, and I don't know
if he's still chasing me or not,
but I just really need to use a phone.
Please. Let me just at least
call my babysitter.
I'll call her for you.
What's her number?
I don't know.
You don't know
your babysitter's phone number?
No, it's... it's on my phone.
He... but he-he took it.
It-It's... everything I need
is-is on my phone.
But-but please, can you just call 911?
Yeah.
Hello.
I'm with a girl
that says she was attacked.
I don't know, but we're on Sunset
right in front of the Vista.
She might be.
You're the girl who was assaulted?
- Yes.
- By who?
Who assaulted you?
Uh, a client at my law firm.
Listen, please, I just need you
to call James Fuller.
He's my boss.
He's-he's the one who set me up
on this dinner.
Been drinking tonight?
One drink, maybe two, that's all.
Get in the back of the vehicle.
N-No, I-I-I'm sober.
- I-I swear. Wait!
- Get in the back of the vehicle.
Face forward.
Look into the camera.
What am I being charged with?
Public intoxication.
But I was attacked.
They're looking into it.
Can you make sure
someone calls my babysitter?
She's expecting me to come home.
Did you leave her number
with the girl at the front desk?
Well, I-I left her name and her address,
but her number's on my phone.
We'll do what we can.
In you go.
Also, I... I need a tampon, please.
I'll let 'em know. Let's go. Come on.
Please, I...
I really need a tampon.
It looks like you had a hell of a night.
Want to talk about it?
Ain't shit else to do.
I don't bite.
You don't happen to have a tampon, do you?
This look like CVS?
Who did all this to you?
No one.
This guy.
Went out on a work dinner.
I guess he thought it was a date.
Maybe it was a date, I don't know.
Ooh.
Whoever he is, fuck him.
I hope he eats a big bowl of razors
and dies in a back alley ditch.
Yeah.
His gin and tonic was shit anyway.
What'd you just say?
I said his gin and tonic was awful.
He made one before dinner.
Did he say that was the only drink
he could make?
Yeah.
White guy...
tall with blue eyes?
Yeah.
He say he really fucking hates dogs?
Why do you know this?
Sorry...
What I'm about to do ain't personal.
Hey! Get me the fuck out of here!
- This bitch is trying to kill me!
- What are you doing?
You… are a marked woman now.
You need to find the First Lady.
Who's the First Lady?
She's your only shot.
Everything you just said to me...
same shit my bestie said to me
before she went missing.
Turned up dead on the steps of the Getty.
Hide.
Do not go home.
You may have gotten away from this guy
once, but he won't ever give up.
- Never.
- Why don't you tell the police that?
They won't believe me.
Are you… for real?!
This man controls men.
Hey! Get me the fuck out of here!
This bitch is trying to kill me!
Hey!
Yeah,
I know exactly who you're looking for.
- Red dress?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Okay.
- What are you doing?
- You have a visitor.
I don't want a visitor.
Hello, sweetheart.
No! No! No, that's him!
That's the guy
I was telling you about! Please!
Please, you can't let him in here.
- Thank you, Michael.
- I'll be back shortly.
No!
No, don't leave him in the cell with me!
- Please!
- Sit down!
You surprised me.
Everything about you reads like
this disposable little cock tease, but...
...but you surprised me.
You have some fight in you.
I didn't mean to be a cock tease.
Don't lie.
- I promise.
- Stop lying.
You walked right into my house
with your...
"fuck me" dress.
I know exactly what you wanted.
I wanted to meet someone nice.
You know what?
You did better than that.
You met me.
I just want to go home.
Please.
Please just let me go home.
And I will let you try.
I-I won't even tell James.
Really, I won't tell James,
and-and I'll-I'll tell them
that I made the whole thing up.
- Really.
- Mm.
It doesn't matter if it happened or not.
Because no one's gonna believe you.
Because no one cares.
The only thing that matters now...
...is our little game.
Do you want to play?
I don't want to play a game.
I'm gonna hunt you.
And if you make it through the night,
then I'm gonna let you live.
Do you want to play?
Please.
Please don't do this.
Please don't do this.
- But your body's calling me.
- No.
- No, it's practically screaming.
- No.
It is.
I have to hunt you.
Please don't do this.
Mmm.
I think you can do it.
- Yeah.
- I can't.
I believe in you.
You know what?
I'm gonna give you a head start.
Okay?
Cherie Vida?
- Yes?
- You made bail.
But I-I don't want to go. I want to stay.
I don't give a shit what you want.
You don't make the rules around here,
now, do you?
Now. Come on.
Do you know where Grand Street is?
It's that way.
Got any quarters?
Fucking...
Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!
I'm so sorry, I don't have any money,
but I can pay you back later.
Where are you going?
155 South Grand.
You know,
you shouldn't be out here by yourself,
a young girl like you.
You're not the first girl I picked up
looking like this.
Like what?
Looking like you do.
Running, scared.
What happened to the other girls?
Is this your house?
No, it's my boss's.
Good.
That's good.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Cherie.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God, look at you.
Come, come.
This way.
- Oh, dear God.
- Sorry.
I know it's your anniversary.
That doesn't matter.
Come here. Have a seat.
Sit down, right here. Come.
What happened?
I don't know.
H-He turned on me.
He tried to kill me.
Ethan?
This is unbelievable.
I mean, of course I believe you.
It's just, it's completely
out of his character.
Then what is his character?
Judy!
Judy!
Judy!
- Can we get some tea, Judy?
- Yes, yes.
Can we please get some tea now?
Oh, Cherie.
God, yeah, of course. Oh, um...
I should call the police.
I'm-I'm gonna call the police.
I already did. He followed me there.
To the police station?
That doesn't make any sense.
- I'm gonna try him again.
- No.
Do not call and do not tell him
where I am.
Hey. He is not gonna hurt you,
not while you're here with me.
No, you-you don't understand. He's...
There's something wrong with him.
It's-it's... he's like a monster.
Anyone who would do this to you
is a monster.
No, but not like that.
Have you ever noticed
something strange about him?
No, of course not.
I never would have introduced you
to him if I had.
Judy, we would love some tea!
- It's coming.
- I'm sorry.
I think she's probably taken her Ambien
for the night.
I am so sorry.
I will never forgive myself
for this, ever.
I just thought,
after everything you'd been through,
you deserved something nice.
It wasn't nice.
No.
Of course not.
If I wasn't a lawyer, I would handle this
myself in a very different way.
You should stay the night here,
sweetheart.
Please, may I use your shower?
I just really feel like
I need to use a shower.
Of course.
Now, look, I-I will find you
something to put on afterwards,
and, uh, there's a shower
in my office bathroom.
Come. Come with me.
I'm glad it fits.
I'm guessing you might need one of these.
Thank you.
I really should be going.
You must be very frightened.
I am.
Can I offer you a piece of advice, Cherie?
Don't tell my husband.
I won't.
He can smell you.
Who can?
You know who.
Your blood has a very powerful scent.
Keep clean as best you can,
and you may just survive the night.
What's going on?
I was just giving Cherie
some clean clothes.
Thank you.
I really should go.
Um, Trey is downstairs waiting for me.
Trey?
I thought we talked about Trey.
Trey has changed, so I called him.
I really think you should
stay here tonight.
I could even go pick up Luze.
No.
Uh, Luze is at the babysitter's house.
She'll be fine.
This has always been a safe place for you.
I just need you to trust me.
No.
Cherie!
Let's talk about this!
Cherie!
Cherie!
Cherie!
Wait! Wait!
Wait, please. Please.
Please.
- Get in.
- Thanks.
You want me to take you
to the police station?
No. I just need to make a phone call.
Come here, baby.
Hey, Trey. It's Cherie.
I'm in trouble.
Tampons.
- What kind?
- Super.
$5.17.
I don't have any money, but I have this.
You could pawn it for at least 50 bucks
tomorrow if you wanted.
Bathroom's in the back.
There's someone in here.
Hello, sweetheart.
I knew you would be easy,
but this is just...
boring.
Now, relax.
Enjoy it.
Let her go!
Walk away.
Come on, just... let her go.
Walk away.
Oh, thank God.
Oh!
The fuck happened to you?
I-I got in a fight
and they took me to jail. Just go.
Jail? What the fuck you…?
Have you been drinking, Cherie?
'Cause I've never known you
to get in a fight.
- No. No, no, I'm fine. Please just drive.
- No, you're not fine.
- I'm taking you to the fucking hospital.
- No, no. No, no, no, no.
You're going to put this thing in gear
and go.
- Go!
- All right. Damn.
So am I taking you home, or what?
Just drive, okay?
That's it?
Unbelievable.
Hey, do you still have that gun
at your house?
- What?
- The gun, at your house... Do you still have it?
Yeah, I still have it.
I'm a Black man in America, right?
Okay, that's where we're going.
Wait, wait, wait, hold up.
What about Luze?
She's okay. She's with the babysitter.
Okay.
What do you need my gun for?
Hmm?
Hello.
What the fuck is up with you, Cherie?
Can you stop with the 50 questions, okay?
I just need you to be quiet and drive.
Cherie, you're in distress.
You called me and I picked you up.
You don't want me to ask you anything?
That's crazy.
And let's not forget,
you're the one who dumped me, all right?
Ain't got to do shit for you, Cherie.
Could you please just get us
to your house.
Dawn is there, just so you know.
- You think I care about Dawn?
- Uh, bup, bup.
You used to care.
All right, you used to care
a whole lot about Dawn.
I did.
- And then you slept with her...
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- ...so I stopped caring.
- Here we go, here we go.
Different day, same shit.
Are you serious?
"Different day, same shit"?
You fucked my best friend.
No, she came to me
after you kicked me to the curb.
That's what happened.
Don't change history right now.
All right?
I asked you if it was cool
to date your friend, and you said yes.
You said yes, Cherie.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck, Cherie?
- Why you acting all nervous?
- I'm not.
- Don't fucking lie to me.
- I'm not lying to you. I'm just...
Oh, fuck!
The fuck was that?
Trey, don't get out of the car.
What the hell are you going on about?
Just do not get out of the car.
- Relax.
- No, please.
Trey, come back! No, stay in the car!
God.
Yo, relax.
All right? It must've been a racoon
or something.
Just get in the car.
I'm not getting back in this car
until you tell me
why you've been acting
all fucking paranoid. Hmm?
Please, just get back in the car.
Just tell me the truth.
Please.
Trey, just get back in the car.
- It's always the same shit with you. Huh?
- Oh, my God.
Always the same shit. Always...
Trey, I was attacked!
He has been chasing me all night!
He could still be chasing me now!
So will you please
just get back in the car!
Drive.
- What's his address?
- Stop.
All I need is a name and address.
This is why I didn't want tell you.
Why?
Was it a date?
Hmm?
It was a meeting...
that turned into a date.
What does that mean?
My boss set it up. I guess he...
Wait, James set this up?
James set this up?
See, I always knew that man was shady.
He was never gonna really help you.
He was just trying to help me.
Yeah, try to fuck you, maybe.
Man, he was never gonna
really take you seriously, Cherie.
I thought you were smarter than that.
It was a mistake.
Yeah, you damn right it was a mistake.
Hey, Cherie. Cherie, Cherie.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?
- Slow down, slow down, all right?
Let me go give Dawn the heads up
before you show up.
Seriously?
Oh, don't pretend like you'd just
let her in if she came to your doorstep.
I'm not afraid of Dawn.
Shit, I am.
What the fuck?
She could go, yeah, she could go home.
She could go home to her baby, that's who.
- Let's calm down.
- Calm down. You just told me to calm down.
You know what?
No, no, no, no. No, let's go talk to her.
You don't have the balls to tell her,
then I fucking will.
Shit.
Hi.
Who did that to you?
This guy.
A friend of my boss's.
He's a fucking psychopath.
Come here, girl.
I can't go home.
I got you.
Ew.
No, don't make this about you, okay?
Get her some fucking water or something.
- So...
- Jesus.
I...
Let's go.
- Take it! Take it!
- Ah, got it.
That's right.
Damn.
What the hell happened to you?
Would you mind your business, Michelle?
Taking care of Cherie tonight, okay?
Yep.
Is that yours?
Yeah.
Ey, ey, easy.
I think you got bigger problems
than smelling floral.
Would you shut the fuck up? My God.
Hey, you want to watch the movie with us?
Home girl's about to get got
but, you know, in a fun way.
No, I'm good.
Look, I know you and I
got a lot of unresolved shit.
It is what it is.
Okay. Yeah.
Hey, why don't you go clean up,
'cause you're looking really, um...
Well, you know what you look like.
Yeah, like toe-up fucking Barbie.
Really, Michelle?
Yeah, she does.
You don't see it?
So, listen, I called the babysitter.
She can't stay but she has a friend
she trusts, so we're good.
You can sleep in Norlon's room,
if you want.
I really need tampons.
Tampons? Sure. My favorite.
You know I love buying you tampons.
You're gonna have to get them
for Luze someday.
Damn right, I am.
Tampon, pads, heating pads, shoulder pads.
Whatever she needs.
Ooh, good choice.
Listen, uh, what happened tonight...
…it wasn't your fault.
You didn't do anything wrong.
I was just being stupid.
All right?
Nice kicks.
That is clean. I smelled it.
Hey, do you still read those tarot cards?
Uh, not since my grandma passed.
Why? Is there something you want to know?
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Am I gonna die tonight?
Well, Trey's friends usually ask me
if they're gonna get laid.
But, uh...
all right.
I'm gonna start with your past.
Ten of Swords.
Five of Pentacles
and Knight of Swords.
You know what? Let's just...
let's just move on from your past.
You already know what happened.
Let's just go right to your future.
All right?
All right. Future.
Do they all look like that?
Do you still go to church?
No.
You might want to go back.
My, uh... my grandma used to say
there's no bad hand in a tarot reading.
It's all about how you look at the cards.
So even these fucked-up ones could
force you to look at life in a new way.
Like, you see this card?
This is strength, power,
crazy determination.
An unstoppable fucking force.
I already know who he is.
No. This card is not him.
This card is you.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm here for Cherie.
You got to be fucking kidding me.
Let's fucking go.
Do not let him in.
Take Norlon back outside.
He doesn't need to see all this.
No, no, please listen.
Just do not let him in.
No, Cherie.
Let me do this for you.
You guys want to teach
this fucking proud boy a lesson?
I'm always down for that.
Come on in, motherfucker.
Go!
No.
Stay here.
Do not come out, no matter what.
What the hell is this?
Don't say anything.
Is this the guy who hur...
Let's be honest.
Not a huge fucking surprise.
He can smell you.
Your blood has a very powerful scent.
Hello?
Come in.
- Please.
- I need a cross and some holy water.
For what purpose?
I'm being hunted by a monster.
He has already killed six people
and I need help.
Calm down, child. Calm down.
My name is Cherie...
and I am dying.
Give me your cross.
Give me holy water.
Give me anything
that will protect me from him.
Do you want to confess your sins, Cherie?
My sins?
Fuck that.
If you're not gonna help me then...
Who is this man that you speak of?
He's coming.
No, Cherie.
It's just us.
No.
It's not.
He's here.
Somewhere.
Maybe he's been with you all this time.
And maybe it's time to give in.
No.
He chose you.
Hello again, sweetheart.
No. You can't be here.
Why not?
I've always loved old cathedrals.
Especially old priests.
I'm so sorry.
I couldn't help it.
But seriously... holy water?
What are you?
I'm why you're nothing
and will always be nothing.
Because people, they believe in me.
I don't believe in you.
No?
Okay.
Sit down.
No.
Sit down.
You're gonna love this.
Oh, no.
Do you believe in me now?
I'm-I'm, I...
I'm s... I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Never apologize with me.
Come here.
Come with me.
Go!
Take this.
Go. Behind the panel.
Okay.
First Lady?
We need to meet.
Hey.
What's this?
You some kind of soldier girl?
No.
Funny, we didn't meet
when I was serving in Afghanistan.
That's because I wasn't there.
Then maybe you should
take off the uniform.
It's not a uniform.
Well, it used to be one...
before you did this shit.
Take it off.
Unless you want me to take it off for you.
There you are.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Come on, my brothers are waiting outside.
We're late.
Come on.
They're gonna be really pissed.
- Later, soldier girl.
- Asshole!
I can smell your fucking testosterone
from here!
- Fuck off, bitch. Fuck you.
- Fuck you!
Where are you headed?
Century Spa on Grand.
Self-care at 3:00 a.m.
I like it.
We should all get a scrub at Century.
This night blows,
and it was supposed to be a celebration.
It still is.
My girl got into
the M.A. program at Stanford.
Marine Science.
- She's gonna solve it all.
- By 2050,
there's gonna be more plastic
in the world's oceans than fish.
We need your brain.
We desperately need the female brain.
And it's Friday night!
Yes! Oh! You should come surfing with us
- after your scrub.
- Oh. I-I don't surf.
Oh, no, we'll teach you.
- We keep an extra long board at the hut.
- 5:25.
We'll hit the waves by 6:00.
There's a sick set coming in at Zuma.
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait.
5:25?
What's that?
Sunrise. If you don't get out there early,
- the macho fucks take over.
- Uh-huh.
- Can I see that?
- Yeah.
This coming year,
this is gonna be our year.
This is the year of the goddamn woman!
- Yes! -Yes!
- Oh!
Now turn this shit up!
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Come on, girl.
Wait, wait, wait. Turn it down.
Are you okay?
Uh, your forehead is bleeding.
Clever girl.
Using bleach.
You did good, sweetheart.
You can be very proud.
You know what?
When you're gone,
your daughter,
she'll be with me.
I'll take good care of her.
I'm gonna raise her like she's my own.
Fuck you.
Get!
Get!
Stay.
Hey.
Where did you come from?
First Lady?
She's inside.
You must be Cherie.
Interesting.
First Lady?
In the flesh.
Or whatever this is.
But you can call me Dinah.
First Lady feels so formal for the
predicament we're in, don't you think?
What is this place?
This place is your only hope.
The negative ions of the charcoal
purify the fuck out of the air.
It puts Febreze out of business.
Doesn't it, girls?
Red lights kill any bacteria that is left.
And your bloody water
gets drained into pipes
that lead all over the city.
He's gonna smell you
on every street corner.
Mm.
Yes.
Finally, you're safe here with me.
I don't have all eternity.
How did you know he could smell me?
Because I was sent here to stop him.
To protect and guide humanity.
But for him, that meant making sure
men stayed in power at any costs.
And they did.
For thousands of years,
there was no accountability.
He pillaged, destroyed and spread lies.
Did you really think Eve
came from Adam's rib?
Try the other way around.
But now… the balance of power has shifted
and he's getting desperate, ruthless.
It's time for us to end
this shit stain on society.
So what are you,
like a… an angel or something?
The first one.
And what does that make Ethan?
- Like a…
- Dick.
A dick.
I mean, I was just gonna go
for demon, but...
A demon is just a corrupted angel.
But forget about him.
This night is all about you.
Wait, me?
Yes, you.
It's our moment.
We're going to take him down tonight.
W… Wait, there… there is no "we."
I came here for your protection.
What do you think I've been doing
all night?
Now, let's get you ready.
The night is almost over
and I need you to lure him out.
You want me to be your bait?
You're the only one who's made it
this close to daybreak,
and that makes you very special.
Clearly, you are very special
so why don't you do it yourself?
I don't bleed.
Your blood is not your weakness,
it's your strength,
and he's obsessed with yours.
He will follow you anywhere.
I-I'm sorry. I-I can't.
There is no way I'm going back out there.
Fuck that.
He'll go after your daughter next.
I've seen Ethan take out
entire matriarchies.
Entire bloodlines gone.
He will never stop hunting you.
Once he kills you, he'll kill Luze.
So, what is it going to be?
Stay here and hide?
Or kill this fucker with me?
Look, even if I could,
I wouldn't know how.
Oh, yes, you do.
You've always known.
5:25.
Let's get you ready, shall we?
Are you ready?
Where are you?!
Hello, sweetheart.
I see you met the First Lady.
What lie did she tell you?
That tonight's the night?
That I'm at my weakest?
At least she understands my power.
That's why she was too scared
to come herself.
Cherie...
...the bait never survives.
We'll see who survives!
The only ones who survive
are the girls who hide.
Cherie.
You're on your own.
Hey.
Wake up. Hey.
How are you surviving now, huh?
Get away from me.
I'm not gonna go anywhere, sweetheart.
You can fight and scream all you want,
but I'm here to stay.
You want to know the truth?
No one wants me to die.
People like that I'm here,
because they know
that I keep girls like you
in your place.
Let me go.
Please.
I know this is over.
Let me go so you can have me.
No.
I want you to have me.
Say it again.
I want you.
I do.
I want you.
Okay.
Okay.
Good girl.
Wait.
What?
It's okay.
I waited for someone like you
for such a long time.
There were moments tonight
where I had my doubts
when you insisted on challenging me.
But now,
seeing you like this...
You believe in me.
You will die
knowing you surrendered yourself to me.
Such a good girl.
What is this?
Huh?
Are you trying to trick me?
You thought that would work?
You and a few rocks?
No!
Not just me.
You bitch!
How are you surviving now?
Huh?
I'll be honest with you.
You don't look so good.
Fucked up by a little sunlight?
I mean, what kind of
pathetic power is that?
Your nights of hunting women are over.
And look.
I brought an old friend of yours.
No! No!
Stop! No!
No. No. No!
Hey.
Hi.
