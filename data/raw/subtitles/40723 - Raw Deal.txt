PAT: This is the day.
This is the day.
The last time I shall drive
up to these gates.
These iron bars won't keep
the man I love locked
away from me.
Tonight he breaks out
of these walls.
It's all set.
11:30.
That's the word
I'm bringing him.
I don't know which
sounds louder.
My heels or my heart.
It's always this way
when I go to see...
- Joe Sullivan.
- Yeah.
You're okay.
Thank you.
You'll have to wait a couple
of minutes. He's got another
visitor with him.
Is that official?
No, I probably have no
business telling you but
I wanted you to know.
Um-hm! How long have you been
with that lawyer of mine?
Oh, since a little before your
trial. Just about a year.
Not 'just about a year'.
It has been a year.
So you think if I keep my
nose clean and my teeth fresh,
Then maybe you can
get me a parole out of this
rat-trap in two or...
Was it three years?
More likely three.
That's fine.
Would you wait three
years for me?
Would I...
- Well I...
- I didn't mean you
particularly. Any dame.
I don't know.
That would depend.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it would.
What ever happened to that
messenger boy, that flunky
down at the office?
Roy? He's still there.
You running all his errands
for him now?
I have always been
interested in your case
since we handled it.
You must be.
This is the third time now.
Second!
You counting them?
My time is about up.
If I can be of any help,
write me at 105, Rochester.
I wish you'd work
on that parole.
- Think about it.
- Yeah, sure I will.
Next time you come up,
don't wear that perfume.
Why not?
It doesn't help a guy's
good behavior.
Okay, Ms. Martin.
You may go in now Ms. Cameron.
Hey, Sullivan!
You have another visitor.
You got five minutes left.
- Hi.
- Hi.
A girl can't trust a guy even
when he's locked up
in the pen.
Nah, turn off the green
lights. You remember her.
How could I forget her?
She practically sat in your
lap all through the trial.
You don't have to wait
any longer.
When?
Tonight.
11:30.
Rick's got everything set.
He's okay.
He ought to be.
You took the rap for him.
Hey. None of that now.
- What are the plans?
- Voices up! Keep your
voices up!
You'll, uh, probably notice
any change in the place.
- Everything is just
as it was before.
- Good. I'm glad to hear it.
I think it's really perfect.
All my friends do too.
Especially Rick.
Rick? He ought to know.
Well, if I uh... If I need
anything, I know where I can
reach you.
And, thanks!
Thanks a lot for coming up.
Oh heck! You don't have to
thank me for anything, Joe.
- Joe, be careful.
- Sure, sure, I'll be careful.
I want to breathe.
That's why I want out
of this place.
So I can take a deep
breath again.
I still don't get it, Rick.
Springing Joe clear.
When he finds out you crossed
him on the Spokane mills
job, he'll come gunning!
Ow! Boss!
Explain it to him Fantail.
I don't get it either. Only,
I ain't asking a question.
Have you ever tried
to make a jailbreak, Spider?
No.
You're smart.
Tell me what's the percentage
of a guy getting out of his
cell without getting cut down?
- One in 1000.
- Good.
That gives him 999 chances
of being cut down.
Supposing he makes that,
what are his chances
of getting over the wall?
- One in 10,000?
- Yeah.
Now you're getting better
than Einstein.
Now, supposing he makes that,
they'll throw a drag net
around the town,
And he still has 1000 miles
of open country
between him and Frisco.
Yeah, there's your chances.
Add them up for yourself.
You always got somebody
else to pull the trigger
for you, don't you?
- Even the cops.
- Why not?
Its legal, besides, I like
to help my friends.
So, I grease open
the first door.
And, even the second.
I'm really nice to Joe.
I like him and Pat.
I open up three doors and let
him take his chances.
Like a ton of bricks.
He was screaming he wanted
out. When a man screams,
I don't like it.
Especially a friend.
He might scream loud enough
for the D.A. to hear.
I don't want to
hurt the D.A's ears.
He's sensitive.
PAT: Waiting...
Waiting...
All my life it seems as if
I've been waiting for Joe.
Joe...
Joe, be careful.
Careful...
(TRAIN HONKING)
(PRISON ALARM RINGING)
(SIREN BLARING)
You're okay baby.
Stuff fits perfect.
Why not?
I guess I ought to know
your size by now, Joe.
Joe, it's so good to be
close to you again.
Hey, hey, stay on that wheel.
Got to keep ahead of
that dragnet.
- Where's the map?
- In the shirt pocket.
That'll be it.
Thurston Park at 11:42.
We'll make it.
Joe, Joe look inside the bag.
There are two passports
and tickets for Panama.
We're sailing from Frisco
in three days.
Three days?
- It's kind of tight.
- The only boat I could get.
How about Rick?
When do I meet him?
Day after tomorrow,
Crescent City.
Good.
You're wonderful baby.
I don't know
what I'd do without you.
Remember to tell me later.
With gestures.
What's that? The motor?
Well it can't be,
I just had it tuned.
Well, don't tell me
you didn't have sense
enough to fill it up.
I may be nuts about you, Joe,
but I'm not crazy.
Here's your answer,
someone got the gas tank.
Joe, what are we going to do?
Ditch it baby, ditch it.
It's no good.
It'll take us forever when
we get stuck in this 'burb.
This is the place.
PAT: We should have been
out of town by this time.
Now we're stuck here.
Our only chance is
to hide out somewhere.
Joe has a plan.
I don't like it.
208.
After that whiff of perfume,
I couldn't wait three years.
Joe!
What are you doing here?
How did you get...
Mustn't touch.
Joe, how did you...
Hear police calls
on that radio?
(SIRENS IN THE DISTANCE)
- Is that for you?
- Yeah.
Got the whole brass band out.
Including fireworks.
I'm trying to kick off.
Joe this is crazy.
It's insane.
RADIO: And is still at large.
Repeat. The escapee is
Joseph Emmett Sullivan.
Six feet one.
Sandy red hair, blue eyes.
Known to have changed clothes.
He is desperate. Armed.
All cars broadcast.
That is all.
Joe you don't stand
a ghost of a chance.
RADIO: Falling sharp. Car 12.
On US 50 going
east towards Pueblo.
Gray Plymouth Sedan.
Escaped convict
reported in it. That is all.
Good. They're starting
to run in circles.
That means Spokane next.
I'll bring you up to
date, baby.
There's a dragnet as tight as
your fist around this town.
I need a hide out
for a couple of days
and I need...
Joe, your best bet
is to go back.
- Go back?
- Turn yourself in.
Are you kidding?
It's still not too late.
Before you get in too deep,
let me call the police.
You think, after the mess
I went through, I'd turn
myself in willingly?
Maybe one of us
is not very bright.
That's right.
Look, I went to see you a
couple of times at that jail.
Why do you think I went?
To see your baby blue eyes?
Could be.
I got interested in a kid
I read about in some records.
When he was 12 there was fire
and he risked his life to
save eight other kids.
He got a medal for it.
I got to wondering,
what happened to that kid?
How would I know.
Maybe there were other fires.
Maybe he became a fireman.
Maybe he got burned.
I wouldn't know.
I'm staying here with you,
like it or not.
I don't know
how to talk to you.
If I had a gun I'd stop you.
You don't need a gun baby.
RADIO: Sheriff substation to
state trooper control.
All covered at points,
Old Creek Canyon, Lincoln Park
the cut off to Salida.
Busy little guys.
How about it.
- You going to
behave yourself or...
- All right, Joe.
All right, you win.
Maybe I was all wrong.
Good.
Good.
That'll make it a lot
easier on all of us.
I'll have my partner come up.
- Partner?
- Yeah.
Do you mind if
I put some clothes on?
No, go ahead.
- Drive me to...
- Sorry mister, I'm engaged.
Engaged.
Hey cab, hold it,
I'll be right down.
Okay, okay.
What do you
think you're doing?
Did you get across?
I will bang you with this.
(PHONE RINGS)
You did it for
my sake no doubt.
What do you think I'm doing,
playing hopscotch?
You'll ruin the only
hideout I've got.
You got a car?
No.
No car, eh?
Get your clothes on,
we're getting out of here.
Oh, no, just you.
You want me to dress you?
Now, leave this door open.
- Pat?
- Yeah.
- Are you expecting a call?
- Yeah, cops.
- She's got telephone-itis.
- Oh, cute.
Look what I found.
Could be our answer.
Two girls in a car
might get through.
They might at that but
I don't like it.
- Now help her get dressed.
- Must I?
Yes.
RADIO: KROX to state
trooper control.
Highway 12 covered.
State route to
Florence covered.
Also Cripple Creek
junction covered.
Highway 66 covered.
That is all.
PAT: Stop fumbling and
get it on.
Pat.
Cops.
Back way.
- Joe, listen.
- You've had your say.
If you want to know what
happened to that kid
with the medal.
He had to hawk it at 16.
He got hungry.
RADIO: Patrol car three,
reporting Captain Fields,
At the road block
Carter Creek junction.
All the points are covered
except Rockville bend.
State trooper patrol
eight reporting.
This must be it.
Rockville bend and
adjacent points covered.
That does it.
If he gets through
this dragnet
He's as slippery as a nail
in a barrel full of oil.
PAT: We've made it, all right.
We've gotten out of town.
But for some strange reason
I feel worse than before.
Like a two-time loser.
Maybe it's the letdown.
Though there is still the
road blocks up ahead.
Or maybe it's because of her.
Sitting next to Joe,
where I should be.
Where I would be if
she weren't there.
If she weren't.
Why don't we
ditch her now, Joe.
Until we get to the roadblock.
Any chance of being picked up
and talking out of turn.
But she's just a fifth wheel.
Listen, if you really love him
why don't you
talk him out of this?
I want whatever he wants.
If he wants out,
I'm with him all the way.
Up or down, make or break.
Why were you so anxious
to get him a parole.
RADIO: We interrupt this
broadcast briefly to bring you
a special police bulletin.
Attention all citizens and
peace officers of
Salida county.
Be on the lookout for a stolen
light gray Dodge convertible.
License number starts with 92.
Dangerous criminals.
Maybe armed.
Keep sharp lookout.
Joe, what are we going to do?
Will you get off
that one note.
How do I know
what we're going to do?
Make up as we go along.
I'm sorry, Pat.
That's all right.
Okay.
- There's a gas
station up ahead.
- Yeah.
- Maybe...
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Keep your eye on
Miss Law and Order here.
She might go soprano on us.
- Got your gun?
- Uh-huh.
Use it if you have to.
Be a pleasure. Could be fun.
- What about the keys?
- Leave them.
Be with you in a minute.
All right, take your time.
Want to stretch
our legs anyhow.
Hey.
Got a match?
Yeah, I think so.
Hey, what are you doing there?
Hey, come back here.
Use their car.
He's coming all right.
Hope he gets a flat.
No, no wish him luck.
RADIO: Patrols on all roads,
keep sharp lookout.
Light gray Dodge
convertible wanted.
The license number
starts with 92.
Maybe armed. That's all.
(SIRENS WAILING)
This is it, all right.
What are you stopping me for?
Come on. Get out.
Now look boys,
I'm chasing some
guy that stole my car.
Okay Ray, see if he's loaded.
Loaded?
Why should I be loaded?
I'm telling you
I'm chasing this guy...
Sir, you want us
to chase up ahead. Don't you?
Yeah, certainly, we can catch
him, he's only up...
Get in and turn
the car around.
- But look,
I can prove that I've been...
- You heard him.
Get in and turn
the car around.
What's the use?
What happened officer?
It's okay, we got the
guy we wanted. Keep moving.
Okay Patty, let her go.
I'm glad you didn't talk.
You'd have shot, wouldn't you?
Would I?
Well, they got the right car
but the wrong guy.
Sullivan pulled a car switch.
Which way was the wrong car
with the right guy heading?
It was a station wagon.
The last information was
they were headed for the
South west toward
the Blue Mountain range.
Send out a four state alarm.
Oregon, Idaho,
Nevada, California.
I'm on my way.
Attention! Four state alarm.
Oregon, Idaho,
Nevada, California.
PAT: We pulled over to a side
road to relax a bit before
heading for Oscar's tavern.
Our hideout in the hills.
There was the
smell of the pines.
The sky.
I suddenly felt...
I don't know.
Big and small
at the same time.
Also...
Freezing.
Can't you build the
fire up a little bit Joe.
You want to give them a
beacon light?
They've got a big enough
chance as it is.
Do we have to go to Oscar's?
We might miss Rick.
Got to get rid of that car,
don't we?
And Crescent City,
Rick Coyle, fifty grand.
Little pitchers have big ears.
She'll behave.
You smell that?
It's that breath of fresh air
I've been wanting
for a long time.
Is it?
That air's only good for a
certain kind of man.
A free man.
What do you call this?
I'm free now.
Are you?
Feeding out of bean cans,
running from one hole
in the ground to the next.
You call that free?
Joe, turn up
the music a little.
Maybe it'll drown out
that static.
(CHIRPING)
What's that?
That was only a chipmunk.
Free aren't you?
- Now listen...
- Don't let it get
under your skin Joe.
Some day before we're through,
I'm going to tear you apart
and forget to put you to...
(HOOVES CLOPPING)
There's a horseman
coming down the hill.
- Good evening.
- Hi.
You folks got a
camp out permit?
Oh, that's right, come on Pat,
help me put out the fire.
Lots of earth on it.
It's really my fault,
she's from out of state.
But I ought to know better.
Well we've got to be
mighty careful.
Yes, I know what
a bad fire can do.
We were just about to leave.
We stopped for a bite to eat.
You girls alone?
Yes.
I promised my friend
a camping trip.
You know,
I really should
run you in for this.
But you've been
pretty nice about it.
Oh by the way
you haven't any fire arms?
No, of course not.
Well, good night.
Have a nice trip.
Thank you.
Pretty close.
Oh boy, I thought that was it.
Me too.
Thanks Ann.
Thanks?
I didn't do it for you.
I did it for that kid.
You'd have shot him down.
I saw you with that gun.
I saw the look on your face.
- You're a murderer.
- Now, wait a minute.
I may have
romanticized you before.
But now I know you.
You're something
from under a rock.
You don't have to worry about
me turning you in anymore.
I don't have to.
You'll get yours somehow,
sometime, somewhere.
What does she know.
Come on, we've got to
make time.
Your bet.
Call.
This is a silly way to
celebrate your birthday,
Ricky. Come on.
- You're making me nervous.
- Not so fast, Rick.
But I thought we were
going to have a party.
Not a card game.
I guess this just
isn't your lucky day.
Deal.
And you,
you go dance with Brock.
Or the waiter.
You're bothering me!
I see they haven't
caught Joe yet.
They'll catch him.
You seem to be
enjoying yourself, Fantail.
Now some day I'm going to
figure out something for you.
Something very special.
And very funny.
- This is for your birthday.
- Good.
I'll continue this later.
Look boss,
I'd like a word with you.
- It'll keep.
- No it won't. It's about...
Put some more Courvoisier
in there. Just a drop or two.
- Look boss, you don't...
- Sit down, Spider!
That's beautiful.
Joe.
- Joe, what?
- The word just came through.
Joe Sullivan,
he's in the clear.
A million to one shot.
You even greased the doors.
Supposed to meet him,
Crescent City.
Tomorrow night.
Worth 50 grand.
This sure is your birthday.
(WOMAN SCREAMS)
Take her away.
She should have
been more careful.
WOMAN: He's just a brood.
I don't know why you
stick to him. Oh, my God.
MAN: Fix her up in your room.
Be careful.
What's the matter Fantail?
Didn't you like that?
Don't you have
anything to say?
You were having a lot of fun.
Weren't you?
All right. This'll amuse you.
You're going to meet Joe
for me tomorrow night.
At Crescent City.
I don't want him
to meet me ever.
PAT: We drove all night
through the quiet hills.
Joe hadn't said a word.
I knew or I thought I knew
what was going on
inside of him.
She was getting
under his skin.
Once I tried to talk to him
about it but he told
me to shut up.
Joe!
When did they let you off?
They didn't.
It's a hot trail Oscar.
I see.
Pull in the shed.
Word hasn't gotten up here
about me yet, huh?
- Well, we're out
of the main line.
- Good.
Now this is Pat and Ann.
We want some food
and a different car.
Food's easy but...
The only crate I got is that
one up on the jack in there.
Won't have it ready
until late tonight.
Well, that'll be okay, if I
can get to Crescent City by
12 o'clock.
Come on, you kids want to
get washed up?
How's Fran?
OSCAR: Worried as usual.
PAT: Ouch!
What a dumb,
stupid thing to do.
- Darn high heels.
- Come on, come on.
Up in the cradle.
Got to break a leg to get
you to hold me like this.
- I'm a big help.
- Shut up.
Been okay.
Deep down, I guess I have
no real proof of what I know
is happening.
Watching him.
One thing keeps
ringing inside of me.
He's never really
told me he loved me.
Funny how that keeps
coming back now.
I hadn't minded it before.
I'd always been more than
ready to take him
at any terms.
But now...
Lucky it's only a sprain, hm?
Oh, yeah.
You'll be okay
in the morning, kid.
Just keep off it.
Remember that time we were
dancing at the Pavilion.
I sprained it then too
and you said that...
You're not listening.
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?
Nothing important.
Empty. I...
I'll go hop down and see
if Oscar's got a fresh pack.
No, I've got some right here.
No, mines all gone too.
I'll be right back.
You and Mac, take the
road up to the right.
Frank, Bob and Chuck
come around Hooker's Pass
and up the back.
Ray and Don take
the side turnpike.
And the rest of you,
follow the foot lanes.
And remember, all of you,
Close in on him
from every side.
Don't give him a chance.
Remember, he's dangerous.
Okay, let's go.
Oscar.
- Seen Ann?
- No, I haven't seen her.
I could have this crate in
shape in half a three
quarters of an hour.
Fine.
Enjoying the view?
- I was.
- Wait.
- Let me go, Joe.
- Uh-uh.
It's the perfect spot for
guy meets gal.
Moonlight. Water, everything.
Even music.
Except that I'm not the girl
and you're not the guy.
Now that's right, isn't it?
I seem to remember that
I'm something from
under a stone.
If you want to know,
you're right.
I am something from
underneath a rock.
A whole pile of it.
Corkscrew alley,
Dean's orphanage.
That famous rock that hit you
in the back of the head after
you've tried to help someone.
Not to mention that heap
I busted out of called
the state pen.
A whole tidy little
pile of rocks.
But I'm climbing right up on
them until I reach the top.
To what end? More crime?
I wanted to see how you'd
react when you got kissed by
something from under a stone.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
What do you know
about anything?
You probably had your bread
buttered on both sides since
the day you were born.
Safe.
Safe on first, second,
third and home.
That's what you think.
Just because I own a car
and a tailored suit and
my nails are clean.
You think I've
never had to fight?
I got an education, sure.
I suppose that means
that I was born with
a silver spoon, doesn't it?
My father was
a school teacher.
He died in the
war of the depression.
Only he didn't get any medals.
Or any bands. Or any bonus.
He left three children.
You think you had to fight.
The only way
you know how to fight
is that stupid way with a gun.
Well, there's another way
you probably never
even heard of.
It's the daily fight
that everyone has.
To get food and an education.
To land a job and keep it.
And some self-respect.
"Safe." I never asked
for anything safe.
All I want is just a little
decency. That's all.
I want you to leave Joe alone.
You understand?
You're poison to him.
He was sure of himself.
He knew where he was going
until you came along.
If it makes you feel any
better, Joe means
nothing to me.
Not now.
Then that's for nothing.
Thanks.
I probably deserve that.
OSCAR: Joe! Joe!
Yeah?
I just got a phone call,
A guy ran amok, killed
somebody, he's heading
this way.
Listen.
(DOGS BARKING)
Come on, get in the house,
kill the lights.
Joe!
I should have let
my own hounds out,
That would've kept 'em off.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
MAN: Let me in.
Go away or I'll blow
your head off!
Let me in, let me in!
Let me in please.
Let the poor slob in.
Joe, use your head!
Don't be a chump.
You can't, you can't.
Open it up, Oscar.
Thanks.
What did he do?
This dumb fool killed someone
and landed up here.
No, It wasn't just someone
I killed.
It wasn't just someone, it
was her.
I don't know why, I don't
know why I did it.
I loved her.
I don't know why, I
don't know why.
Let's get out of here.
What's the point in going?
Nothing's no good.
- Lord I wish I was...
- Get him a drink Fran.
Not for a wife murderer.
Yeah I murdered her.
Oh it's no good doing that
to your woman, no good.
Get the tear gas, Bruce.
Go ring the house boys, we'll
smoke them out if we have to.
Anyone in there come out, or
we'll come and get you out.
I got it coming to me, I got
it coming, I got it coming.
- Shut up!
- No, no I got it coming to me.
I deserve to be, I got
it coming.
May, it's not good
without you!
(GUNSHOTS)
That could be you.
Quick Joe, one of them is
headed this way. Get in that
store room.
I'll take care of them.
Come on.
- Everyone okay here?
- Yeah.
- Good.
- He threatened us, made us
turn off the lights.
- Mind if I use your phone?
- No, go ahead.
State police please.
Hope it didn't upset
you, ma'am.
Hello, Jim?
Yeah, all is clear here.
Up on Oscar's tavern.
Was a little rough but he
had it coming to him.
Time, about 9:20.
See you later.
Well goodnight folks,
sorry about all the trouble.
Should be in Crescent City in
two hours, that will put you
there before midnight.
Thanks Oscar, as soon as I
get my dough from Rick I'll
take care of you.
That's okay, my regards
to Rick.
- Keep on your toes,
be careful.
- Right.
I'll drop off Ms. Flowers over
at the bus station
Then hop over and meet
Rick at Grimshaw's.
- And collect the 50 grand.
- I think I ought to go
with you.
What, on a pogo stick?
You'll be a big help.
Give those ankles some rest.
- Are we staying here long?
- Just long enough to collect.
Be careful, and come
back soon.
You bet I will.
As they say life begins at
50 grand.
Hey Grim, you watch this.
I never get it more than two
stories high.
Why don't you just build
bunglows?
Why don't you just take that
hole in your head
and close it.
Looks like he ain't going
to show.
Yeah, that'll break my
heart too.
Especially if the cops have
already kissed him off.
Guess maybe I'll close up.
- Try and get some sleep.
- Yeah close up.
(ENGINE HUMS)
Here comes a car.
Pull the shade down.
I'll be in the back room
rolling out the red carpet.
What are we stopping here for?
This isn't the bus terminal.
No it isn't, is it.
I thought that if you didn't
mind waiting, I'll take care
of my business first.
Give me more time to
put you in the bus.
On second thought you
better come on in with me.
Cute little gadget, Walt
rings up a sale even before
you buy anything.
Hello Joe, glad to see you.
Hello Walt, Rick here?
Yeah, he's waiting for you in
the back room.
Why don't you pick yourself
out a trinket?
Little memento of our trip.
Say for a boy and a girl?
Or better yet, a boy and
two girls.
Thanks, I will.
Oh yes, I've got some very
fine things here.
- Now you take the...
- See I told you he had a cash
register mind,
Rings every time he opens
his mouth.
- Where is he?
- Right here.
- Which one?
- That ain't bad.
Only I'm a more reasonable
facsimile thereof.
- I recognize the signature.
- Good.
I always said it's a pleasure
talking to a sharp guy.
You don't waste breath.
- Precious thing, breath.
- Yeah.
That's the way it is, some
guys win, some guys lose.
Do you mind putting your
hands up a little higher?
Thanks.
Cat skinner, get his gun.
Turn around now jerk, and
I hope you don't mind me
calling you jerk.
Go right ahead.
Called that a lot lately,
in much better language.
Grimmy, what would you charge
me to mount a head?
Good looking head, a
smart head.
Busted itself right out of
the big house, got by all
the road blocks,
And ran right smack in here.
To get itself mounted.
What a smart head.
Gonna tell Ricky too how you
mistook this grizzly for him,
He'll get a kick out of that.
He might even die laughing.
Now move, crumb.
Outside.
The sand is soft, you won't
hurt yourself when you fall.
Come on, move.
(EXCLAIMS)
(CHOKES)
(A GUNSHOT)
(SOBBING)
Ann.
Joe, Joe, he's dead.
- I've killed a man.
- No, no you didn't, you
didn't kill him.
- Oh thank heavens,
you're sure?
- Yes.
But I might have.
- I could have.
- Don't think about it, Ann.
I picked up the gun and then,
- I saw him about to...
- Ann, don't, don't.
- How could I have ever?
- Ann listen...
Listen, if it makes you feel
any better,
Try and think about it this
way, you did it to save
my life.
I know I'm not worth it
but then...
Oh yes, you are.
Oh Joe, Joe I do love you.
We'll talk about it later.
Look Pat, don't ask questions,
do as I say.
Rent a car and meet me on the
beach road below town.
Right away.
What's wrong?
That's the end of the line.
There's a car over there
waiting for you.
Go on and take it.
Take it and go home.
Joe!
We fit together like
a bird and a cat.
Last night was... Last night.
Go on, do what I tell you.
Keep your nose powdered,
drive carefully and don't
pick up any hitchhikers.
Or ex-convicts.
They might hurt you.
Joe...
You don't dare look at me.
Go on... Go on get out
when I tell you!
PAT: I suppose,
I should feel some kind
of victory, but I don't.
I even feel sorry for her,
passing her like this.
She too is a dame
in love with Joe.
And she's lost.
I've been behind
that eight ball
too often myself.
Ought to know how she feels.
How she feels.
- How many, please?
- Uh, five... Just five.
Look, Rick...
I've been watching the roads
all morning, like you told me.
I'm just one guy!
That'll be a dollar.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Uh, is this the shortest way
back to San Francisco?
- Yes ma'am.
- Thank you.
(ENGINE STARTS)
If you close that sewer of
yours something just turned up
I think you're going to like!
PAT: In less than
an hour we'll be leaving
San Francisco...
Now that we're actually
going, I...
I have a kind
of feeling for this city.
Even Corkscrew Alley,
way over on the other side.
Where I grew up, jumped rope,
Cried, laughed,
Fell in love and now...
Joe?
What are you doing
with the gun?
- I'm going to kiss
a friend of ours goodbye.
- Rick?
You know a better friend?
Joe...
Oh Joe, that's a sucker play!
I owe him something.
You didn't think
I was going to leave without
paying him off?
But... Darling, our boat
leaves in two hours!
- And I'll be back in time.
- Yes...
Or six feet under.
That's where you'll be.
Don't you see, that's just
what he wants you do.
He's been praying
for you to walk in.
- He's going to get his prayer.
- Joe! Joe, listen.
This is your one chance
to break free.
Don't throw it away on him.
He's not worth it.
Let go, Pat.
Nobody pulled
a punch like that on me
and got away with it.
You mean you'd risk
your one chance,
our chance...
- Just to get back at him?
- You seem to forget,
He tried to put
a meat stamp on me.
Also there's a little matter
of 50Gs.
What do I care about the 50Gs!
You're alive,
that's all I care about!
Pat, you don't understand.
I've got to!
Okay.
Okay, go ahead, go to him,
pin his ears back,
be a hero
And get yourself shot down
in the process.
What do I care,
if you're dead.
Or caught again.
Doesn't mean a thing to me.
Not a thing.
- No, now look Pat...
- No, not Pat,
Patsy's the name...
A little dumb bunny who'll
wait 10, 20, maybe 30 years...
Who'll sit and cry
and wait. Go ahead!
If Ann asked you,
I'd bet you'd do it!
- Keep her name out of this.
- Why?
Who is she that
I can't mention her?
Chiseling little doll face,
What is she to you
that I'm not?
- Cut it!
- I think she's got
her hooks into you good!
She's wormed her way into you
so that you don't know what
you're saying
-You don't know what
you're doing...
- Cut it!
And I can't even
mention her name!
That sweet talking,
precious little...
Okay, Joe...
Okay, do what you want.
Come on, get inside.
Look what I brought you, Rick.
So, you let Joe get away?
You must have a lot
of nerve to show up.
- Now, wait a minute, Rick...
- What for, excuses?
Who's she?
What do I want with her?
This is Joe's girlfriend,
his particular girlfriend.
She was with him
on the whole trip.
Yeah?
Where's Pat and Joe?
I don't know, I have no idea.
Naturally you have no idea.
There are ways of finding out.
There are ways.
I almost did something I...
I never dreamt, I'd ever do.
I almost called the police.
I was going to...
Oh, Joe...
Well, I uh...
I don't know how...
That's the trouble,
I don't know how...
Okay. Okay.
You've forgiven me
a thousand things before
without my asking.
Come on, let's go.
- Get your things.
- My things?
Sure, sure, the clothes
you bought for us
this afternoon.
A fellow and his girl going to
take a boat trip, they usually
dress for it, don't they?
Get into your duds
and we'll get out of here!
- Did she spill?
- No, she didn't know
where he was.
You, I gave you
a set up and what happened?
I don't even know where he is.
Rick, I just got the word,
Pat Cameron
at the Clark Hotel.
- Joe with her?
- Don't know,
they didn't see him.
Maybe he's coming
to see you Rick.
We've got to stop him
before he gets here.
- What do you suggest? You got
any other bright ideas?
- Yeah.
You guys get down to
the alley. I want the whole
street covered.
Get down there and get him.
I don't want to see him.
(SNEERING) I'll bet you don't.
Maybe he ain't coming
here, Boss.
Maybe... Maybe he's trying
something else. Maybe...
I gotta know where he is!
Here, get on the phone,
Spider. Call Pat Cameron.
- What for?
- Don't argue with me!
Just call her!
- I'll tell you what to say.
- Okay... Okay...
- Joe? Joe, I'm ready!
You ready?
- Sure!
- Oh honestly, they talk about
women and their make-up!
- How much time have we?
- Forty minutes!
- That's plenty of time.
You want us to look like
a couple of true blues, didn't
you? Instead of lamsters?
- Well, in your case, I don't
think it's gonna help any.
- Oh! Is it so?
No! Now, Joe. Now...
Quit horsing around!
Every second counts!
(PHONE RINGING)
You get it.
Hello?
Rick Coyle's got Ann...
Ann Martin.
If Joe don't show by
12:30, you won't
recognize her!
And if you ask me personally,
you better come quick!
(STAMMERING) Yes... Thanks.
Who was it?
(STUTTERING) The desk
clerk, he wanted to know
if we were checking out...
If we needed anything.
Then I hope you told him.
We could use a police escort
down to that freighter.
Matter of fact, I could use
a carton of cigarettes.
No, Joe, we haven't got time.
We'll pick them up on the way.
What's the matter with
you, Pat? You feel alright?
All of a sudden, I'm...
I'm scared.
Don't worry.
We'll make it okay.
Come right in, Captain Fields.
Good evening, Sergeant.
I'm looking for this specimen.
Oh-ho-ho... Joe Sullivan.
One of our local boys.
Where did he used to hang out?
Round the docks,
the wharf area.
I've been tailing that guy for
over 60 hours. I'm sure he has
landed back in San Francisco.
Sergeant, I need your help.
I don't want him to skip
the country.
I'll have my men cover
the dock area.
(SIRENS BLARING)
- Take it easy. Almost jumped
out of your skin.
- I'm alright.
Sure, sure. As soon as
this boat pulls out we'll
both feel a lot better.
Nice, snug little place.
- Hey, sailor, the captain
a God-fearing man?
- Huh?
- Does he carry a Bible?
- Guess so...
I understand at sea your
captain can legally perform
a marriage.
Si! Si! That is a lucky thing.
Marriage at sea. I go tell
captain! In about an hour?
Yeah, yeah, in about an hour.
Joe!
- Joe... I...
- Don't. Don't try to say it.
I know we haven't talked about
this before but, well,
-Kind of making a fresh start,
aren't we?
- Joe, you really want to?
Sure. Sure, I do.
We gotta do it right!
We gotta do the whole
thing right.
Lights of Frisco.
Blacking out in a minute.
You know I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately...
Don't laugh...
Five and ten minutes we'll
be pulling out.
Pulling up in a new country.
Leaving everything behind.
Maybe... Maybe we can make
a different life for ourselves
in South America.
A good life.
Quite good I hear.
I've never been there myself.
A friend told me.
It's a good place...
New place...
Might be able to get a little
ranch, a business
or something.
Start fresh.
Decent.
Have a house.
Kids maybe, to make
it more bright.
Scrub them all up,
send them off to school.
(STEAM WHISTLE BLOWING)
(BELLS CHIMING)
It's the engines.
Five, six minutes we'll be
shoving off.
You know, with everything we
got on the ball, we could make
something of ourselves.
Something decent,
something that
Isn't always afraid
of the daylight.
PAT: Why didn't he stop
talking, or the clock
stop moving?
He was saying everything I'd
ever wanted to hear.
All my life, the lyrics
were his, alright...
But the music Ann's...
Ann's... And suddenly I saw
that every time he kissed me,
he'd be kissing Ann...
Every time he held me, spoke
to me, danced with me, ate,
drank, played, sang...
It would be Ann... Ann...
Ann!
Joe...
Joe, listen.
I lied to you.
That phone call...
It wasn't the desk clerk.
It was Spider.
Ann's in trouble... Bad
trouble... She's with Rick!
- Why don't you watch where
you're going?
- Who says so?
Go on, get off the street.
Kids like you oughta
be in bed at this hour.
(GUNS FIRING)
(DOGS BARKING)
(GUNS FIRING)
Where's Ann?
Where is she, Rick?
She's alright, Joe.
She's alright.
(NERVOUSLY) I've got the
fifty-thousand for you, Joe.
You wouldn't do anything,
would you, Joe?
You always were a square guy.
Joe, you know I never
carry a gun.
(GUN FIRING)
(GUN FIRING)
(SHRIEKING)
(DISTANT KNOCKING)
Ann!
Ann!
ANN: Joe!
Joe...
Joe...
(SIREN BLARING)
Joe!
Joe, darling...
Hey, none of that.
Don't cry.
I got my breath of
fresh air. You.
(DISTANT SIRENS BLARING)
PAT: The police picked me up
and brought me here.
There's my Joe in her arms.
A kind of happiness on
his face.
In my heart I know that
This is right for Joe.
This is what he wanted.
