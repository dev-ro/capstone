In the reign of King Kang Hsi of
Ching Dynasty.
Shaolin joined with Chan Kan Nam and
his heaven and Earth Asso.,
formed secret societies to rebel China
and restore Mine Dynasty.
Among the rebellious heroes,
Hung Hey-Kwun was the one who
frightened the Ching soldiers most.
Son, my dear son.
Man Ting,
the government wants to
kill our family.
We can't stay here any longer.
From now on,
I have to go into fugitive.
You will be a burden to me.
But I can't take away
your right of living.
Now, let's bet.
If you choose the knife,
We will live and die together.
If you choose the wooden horse,
I will send you to hell.
To see your mom.
This tear is the last tear of us.
From now on,
we can't shed tear but only blood.
Brother, Brother Hung.
I am sorry, I am so sorry.
Ma Ling Yee is late,
please put all the blame on me.
Get up! It's none of your business.
I've heard that the government
wants to execute your tribe.
So, I hurry here from Kwangsi.
But, I am late.
Inform Fong Sai-yu and San Tak.
Because they will be
the next targets of the government.
How about you?
Forget about me, go now.
I can't?
Kill!
Those retreat should be killed.
Why do you betray me?
Since we were kids,
master said I could never defeat you.
I am far behind you.
I don't think so. So,
I have to kill you today.
Why do you kill my family?
I've the imperial order
to get your head back.
You work for the government?
Everyone wants to be rich and famous,
don't you?
Just for fame and money?
Don't you think it isn't enough??
Wonder Screw!
Wu Tak-tai, Ma Chiu-hing,
Choi Tak-chung,
Li Si-hoi, Fong Tai-hung.
I am tattooing a map
which locates the Ming treasure
on your back.
I know the government will
come to get it.
So, I just tattoo a part on your back.
Once 5 portions are gathered,
you may get the treasure
to finance our revolution.
The original,
I will burn it now.
On the Lunar New Year's Eva
of this year,
I'll send you to Nu Village.
Chan Kan Nam, head of Heaven
and Earth Asso, will be waiting for you.
Once he gets the treasure,
he will save the world.
I don't understand,
why he tattooed on our back!
Master said,
we have to save the world.
What? Can the tattoo save the world?
Save the world,
means help other people in need.
Will we be awarded with food?
You always think of food!
We should be righteous.
My dad told me, if we get no advantage,
we can't think of doing it.
My dad says so. Even doing good deeds,
we have to look for advantage.
How can your dad do that?
Can he claim himself human?
What? They called my dad
the Great Benefactor.
Tomorrow, I will go him to
celebrate his birthday.
Dad, I have learnt some Kung-fu
in Shaolin Temple.
I've told you,
don't mention you are
learning Kung-fu in Shaolin.
If it's heard by others,
you may have trouble.
But why did you send me there
to learn Kung-fu?
Idiot, you just learn,
but you needn't admit you are learning.
Just have a walk with me
if you are free.
To see if there is any good deed
you can do.
Why do you always do good deeds?
I didn't have a son when I was forty.
One day, I met a monk, he asked me to
do one good deed per day.
Later, you were born, a son.
Therefore, I always do good deeds.
But with benefits!
Do remember to get some interest. Right?
Yes!
Let's go!
Man Ting, hide the things.
Boss, how much is a pear?
2 cents!
Give me two please!
Alright!
One is okay!
Thank you!
Mom...
A man and a kid are coming,
they seem to be great Kung-fu masters.
Don't be nosy, be careful,
don't be disclosed.
Man Ting, I have to see one person,
don't move.
No matter what happens,
hold your temper.
Until I call you.
She is so poor, she sells herself to
bury her mother.
If I had money, I would buy her back.
You have to be careful.
I've heard that,
there are two female thieves.
They are called
the Notorious Mother and Daughter,
they cheat!
There is a man,
all his stuffs were stolen by them.
She looks to be cultured,
I don't think she is a thief.
If she is like a thief,
no one will fall into her trap, right?
Let's go.
What's the matter?
Didn't I tell you,
be careful with what you say.
He is not moving, like a stone.
Come on, let's go to play.
Throw him to death.
Right! Throw it to him!
Get him! Hurry up!
I'll beat you!
Thank you for meeting me,
in such a poor circumstance.
We are brothers,
we have same blood!
I know you have been wanted
by the government.
I always want to find you,
but I failed.
I am your brother,
I should have worried about you.
So I come to ask for your help.
Now, I am wanted.
I can hide no where.
So, I just want you to take care of
Man Tin temporarily.
Don't worry!
If I don't help you,
how can I claim myself human?
Do you know the raid to
Shaolin Temple?
What for?
Master Chi Sin's a map which locates
the treasure of Ming Dynasty.
They are the treasure collected
by Ngai, the notorious eunuch.
The government wants it by all means.
What's your name?
I am called Red Bean.
Miss Red Bean.
I am so poor!
Son,
you may do good deeds of this kind.
I will help you, I will buy you.
Old fellow, can you make it?
Don't make her a young widow.
Shit! How can you be so nosy?
Miss, if you want to follow him,
why not follow me?
What the you doing?
How dare you beat me?
So what?
I just want to make sure that,
whether you want to beat me or not.
Ask Man Ting here,
let's leave here at once.
Man Ting.
Brother, we are brothers,
how can you betray me?
I work for money.
You'd blame yourself of
being too foolish.
Luckily I've discovered your trap
before it's too late.
How do you know that?
The map of the treasure is
a serious matter.
Chan Kan Nam, has informed me secretly.
He wants me to help in this matter.
You left Shaolin for ages,
you can never know such details.
I've been discovered, so what?
Your spear is now with me.
Man Ting!
Dad, take the spear!
Man Ting, do remember.
You should kill with no mercy.
Everyone knows my identity,
so no one should be alive.
No one should be alive.
Brother, forgive me.
Since I am your brother.
Man Ting, please ask for mercy for me,
I am your uncle.
Man Ting, remember the last words,
don't be kind-hearted to such person.
My assistant is coming,
you will be dead meat, Don't go!
Miss Red Bean, don't do, wait for me.
Mr. Hero!
What's the matter?
Are you interested
to be the Kung-fu teacher of my house?
I am not interested!
Hero...
Nothing!
Are you thrown by stones?
I am fine!
Remember!
When you can not hold your temper any
longer, don't hold your temper any more.
Are you hungry?
Where is the pear which I've bought?
It's ruined by the stone.
Let's go to eat noodles.
Our money is finished,
we should find some place to hide.
Miss Red Bean, follow me,
I'll make some beautiful dresses for you.
You will be very pretty.
Thank you, master.
Okay, let's go!
Do you want me to be your bodyguard?
Not bodyguard, but teacher.
That's bodyguard! Don't you afraid
I have been a killer?
If I don't tell others,
no one will know it,
but your pay will be deducted.
Okay, I will do it.
Fine, follow me, let's go!
Let me wear them for you.
You are like a stone.
It's so pretty, do you like it?
I am so happy!
Love it? I will kiss you,
so you will be happier.
Someone is around!
I've nearly forgotten them.
Come, go and have you lunch first.
You are lucky to meet me.
I will pay your living.
If, someone wants to bully me,
beat him.
If I want to bully someone, beat him.
If I want to ask someone to
repay the money he owes me, beat him.
If someone wants me to
repay the debt I owed him, beat him.
Is that simple?
I can only guarantee your safety.
I can't bully others for you.
Do you ever use your brain
to think?
You know? Bullying others
is the origin of joy.
Think, if other's money becomes my money.
Other's house becomes my house.
Other's woman becomes my woman.
It will be so happy.
However, if your money and woman
have been taken,
will you feel great pain?
I've thought about it of course,
so I want to employ you.
I want you to help me
to prevent such case.
So, from now on,
only I can bully others,
but not vice versa.
It will be so happy.
I think I can't help you.
Mr. Hung!
Just care of my safety,
I will ask someone
to bully others.
Let's go for food.
Sorry, I am hungry, I have eaten.
Never mind, we'll have dinner soon,
let's eat later.
Dad, eat this.
Where did you get it?
It's sent by sister Red Bean.
Be careful, I don't think she is kind.
Well, I won't eat her dumpling then.
Man Ting, don't you think
it's tough to stay with me?
No, I love to stay with you.
Mom!
Get up, stop pretending!
I will stab you with the dagger.
You disappoint me.
I am damn hungry!
See, I always take care of you.
Chicken!
Wow! That old fool gave you
so many valuable stuffs!
He gave me, but not yours.
I know,
I know!
We have an agreement,
let's share it.
Come on, share it!
Alright, I am a filial girl,
won't forget your share.
Mom, take it!
Wow! You are so generous.
It's so thin!
Take it to me!
Alright, I will do it myself.
You have one, and I have one.
Wait, it's not good to
share like this, take it out.
Share it equally One, two, three.
Do you want to fool me?
This is for my dowry.
What dowry? Who dare to marry you?
It's hard for you to marry,
let me keep it for you.
How to share it?
Break it, to make it pearl powder.
Alright! For facial?
Right!
Touch it, is it smooth.
Wow! So smooth!
How about you?
Wow! Wonderful!
Mom, once you were the first beauty
of the world or martial arts,
Chu Siu Sin,
you deserve such nick-name.
You farted!
Let some fresh air in.
You always fart!
You let me eat sweet potato, you know?
Now you are dreaming.
You feel dizzy, are you feeling dizzy?
Kneel down now!
Kneel down! Release me!
You are so lucky to marry my daughter.
You'd give her all you money.
Otherwise, I will come to see you
three times a day.
And squeeze your neck three times each.
Yes, I know!
Mom!
Master, you are here?
I saw your mom in my dream,
she squeezed my neck.
What did she say?
She asked me to treat you better, hey.
Let's go married three days later.
Alright, but you should ask some monks
to do a ceremony for her.
So, she will go to heaven peacefully.
How much do you need?
Ten thousand taels!
Ten thousand taels?
I think thirty thousand taels
will be better.
Okay, all this left.
I'll keep them
and make a use for family.
It's right!
Miss Red Bean, I've paid,
let me kiss you,
alright?
You are starring at me.
I will close my eyes, okay?
Get out first,
I want to stay with my mom.
That's right!
Share the money now.
The golden chain!
What?
His golden chain
worths over 100 thousands taels.
Don't be so mean then.
Let's get it tonight.
- No!
- Why?
That Master Hung is quite powerful.
Are you washing?
Do you want to eat some candy?
Why not let me help you?
I am washing the underwear of my dad,
will you give me a hand?
Master Hung!
Miss Red Bean,
your wedding is coming soon.
Aren't you busy?
I just want to make
a new clothe for you.
I am always poor,
I don't need new clothe.
You can't put it that way.
If you are properly dressed,
it gives face to Mr. Ma.
Let me measure your collar.
I don't want it too tight,
make it wider, 14 inch.
How about the sleeves?
Master Hung,
your feet are not properly placed.
What do you want to cut?
The cloth of course!
I don't mind the color,
clothing gives you warmth.
Let's see whether the cloth is
enough for making clothe or not.
Just enough!
I don't think so!
I will sew it!
Men don't know how to sew.
I think I am better in sewing.
Enough!
Miss Red Bean, my son and I
roam all over the world.
We just want simple living,
why do you push us?
But I am afraid
you would disclose my secret.
Try my Wonder Kick!
No Shadow Kick!
Shit, she is breathless.
How dare you bite me?
If I don't bite you heavily,
how can you remember me?
You know the Kung-fu of
holding breath.
I see,
you are the Notorious Daughter.
I am a poor girl,
you can say anything you like.
Miss Red Bean,
I am the guard of this house,
I won't let you make any trouble her.
Just don't make any trouble,
then I won't disclose your identity.
Alright, don't try to offend me.
No Shadow Kick is the famous stance
of Hung Hey-kwun.
Are you hung Hey-kwun?
Don't push me to kill you.
You won't, if you wanted to kill me,
you wouldn't have
reserved your power.
I will remember it!
Dad, have you fallen for that girl?
Bull shit!
You told me that,
you couldn't be merciful
to your enemy.
Kill with no mercy.
But you didn't do so
when you were fighting with her.
I loved your mom only.
When you can stand no more,
just don't stand it.
From now on, call me Brother,
then I will teach you Kung-fu.
Brother!
Hung Man Ting, what are you doing?
Practising Kung-fu.
What? Isn't it useful?
Yes!
Why not follow me?
- I will teach you Kung-fu.
- I don't want to learn Kung-fu from you.
What? My Kung-fu is powerful,
why don't you learn from me?
Put down your leg and follow me.
Dad said,
I can't put it down until noon.
You are so cocky!
I will stand it!
You stand steadily!
I will treat you another kick,
go to hell.
Let me go, let me go!
It's noon time.
I can stand no more!
Brother!
Don't offend me any more.
I will take revenge.
Dear brothers,
I am bullied.
Come and help me now,
just escape from the dog hole!
I am now asking my friends to fight
with you.
Go to Shaolin temple now.
Kill!
If you don't want to be killed,
ask the boys out.
Let's go!
Not these two.
Don't let any kids go.
Yes!
Not this one!
Go away!
Brother, what'll we do now?
Stay calm, change position.
Come with me!
Let's escape from the secret passage.
Get in quick!
Rush in!
Stop them!
What is it?
It's a monster!
Chi Sin, long time no see!
I am Ma Ling Yee!
You are Ma Ling Yee?
You betrayer!
Weren't you killed by
Hung Hey-kwun 7 years ago?
I don't deserve being killed,
I am saved by the Monk!
I suffered from the Poisonous juice,
to practise invincible Kung-fu
Now, I've made it!
You said I can't be compared
with Hung Hey-kwun.
Now, your life is controlled by me.
If you don't want to die,
give me the map.
Even you want to kill me,
I won't tell word.
Alright! Go to hell then.
We got them!
Sir, there is no map on their back.
Sir, I've caught a pigeon.
Is this Ma's home?
Ma Chiu Hing!
Hey, you can't go in, go out.
They are my friends.
Here you are.
What are you doing?
Shaolin Temple has been burnt.
Wow! Why?
Master wants us
to go to Nu's Village.
We've to look for Master Chi Kai
and Master Chan Kan Nam.
There are many soldiers
coming to arrest us.
Don't panic, I will give you
some clothes to get changed first.
Then, we will look for dad.
No, it's just rumor.
Dad, I have four...
Dad, I've four enemies,
they want to teach me a lesson.
You owe me 4 cents. Repay me now.
Plus the interest,
total will be 30 cents.
If you don't repay me,
I will beat you up
whenever I see you, got me?
Kid, how dare you be the loan shark?
Go!
Go!
This is your son, isn't he?
Yes!
Didn't you send him
to learn Kung-fu in Shaolin?
No!
He has been staying in
his aunt's place
to study.
That's great!
Wow! So big!
My daughter is so nice,
she knows I love eating chicken ass.
She is great to get the giant one
for me.
Let me eat the chicken leg first.
What a big house,
it takes time to go to the kitchen.
Right!
Keep quiet!
Come in, no one is around.
But a dead body!
You shouldn't scare this.
See, I am sitting on it!
Come and take a seat!
I love eating the ass of a chicken,
but not the ass of a kid.
It's true!
You will sleep here tonight!
But don't let my dad know it!
I am hungry!
See the food there?
How dare you eat my chicken ass?
You'll regret for it.
Shaolin is burnt,
what'll we do then?
Master said,
if we acquaint Senior Hung Hey-kwun,
he'll protect us,
and he'll escort us
to find Mr. Chan Kan Nam.
But I've never seen Senior Hung,
where should we find him?
So, we have to be independent.
We've to take revenge for Shaolin.
But how can we do this?
Why not establish a new school,
to absorb more members?
So, we can be powerful
enough to take revenge for Shaolin.
Well, just call it New Shaolin.
No, the government will arrest us.
Just call it New World.
No...
New Zealand?
Call it New Beyond.
Good name.
You've had a good suggestion.
I didn't say anything.
But the voice came from your side.
How can you deny it?
She did it, she did it, Ghost!
There won't be ghost in this world.
Let's attack together!
Throw her to the wall.
Come on!
Fold her.
See, she didn't have any reaction.
If she is ghost,
she will counter attack.
Let's touch it!
I dare not!
Try, she is breathless.
Sure!
So, let's continue our talk.
Let's put it in this way,
your surname is Wu,
and yours is Ma, yours is Fong.
Let's go out for a competition,
the new school will be
named after the winner.
If I win, it will be called Ma Mun.
If I win, it will be called Wu Mun.
Great!
Hold it, before the competition,
you've to help me to hit a person.
Wait! We are instructed by Master,
we shouldn't go out together.
No matter how,
one should stay behind,
so,
the map can't be gathered by
the government.
Tai Hung, you are the poorest
in Kung-fu, stay behind.
What?
Don't go around!
Granny, I didn't hit you,
it's none of my business.
I just sat on you slightly,
don't blame me.
None of my business,
if you want to scare, just scare them.
You scared me!
Fatty!
Don't blame me, I am only a kid.
You ate my chicken ass,
now, I want to eat your ass.
My ass stinks, it's horrible,
don't eat mine.
So, get some delicious food for me.
If not, I will follow you.
Okay, I am going.
What a chicken,
I don't think
there is ghost in this world.
Please don't blame me.
The fly is disgusting.
My only underwear was torn
while you were washing it.
I am sorry!
Never mind!
I've changed it to smaller one,
for you.
Thank you, dad.
So, you have no underpants.
Never mind, I feel cool.
Did you hit young master?
He bullied me!
Just hold your temper.
But you taught me that,
if I can't hold my temper and more,
just don't hold it.
Now, we are in fugitive,
don't disclose our Kung-fu,
otherwise we will be identified.
No matter how, I won't fight.
468, 469, 470,
471, 472
I've found you at last.
474, 475, 476
Hung Man Ting!
I've to start again.
Young Master, why do you come to me?
I was defeated by you,
so my brothers want to
take revenge for me.
I will defeat you.
I won't fight with you any more.
How can you escape from this?
You defeated me,
you should let me challenge again.
Bastard!
Why do you hit me?
I love it!
Don't push me!
I won't leave
if you don't fight with me.
If I defeat you all,
will you insist another fight?
If you defeat us,
we will greet you as our brother.
Alright!
Tai-chi?
Let's go together!
Let's kill him!
No Shadow Kick!
We are leaving!
What are you doing?
Don't move,
I am going to cure your hand.
Let him go!
If you don't cure your hand,
your hand will be handicapped.
Don't worry, don't panic,
show me your hand.
It hurts!
Your hand is alright!
Brother!
I am younger than you,
how can I be your elder brother?
But you are more powerful than us.
Alright, Brother Hung won.
From now on,
our school will be named after you.
Right, call it Hung Mun.
Hung Mun?
Don't chase me!
Don't play with me! Don't!
Daughter, come over here.
The moon is so bright,
it makes me more beautiful.
Mom, you're poisoned by aphrodisiac,
see, you've red face.
That's why I feel so hot,
I want to undress too.
Use your inner energy
to cure yourself.
I don't know such kind of Kung-fu.
So, I can't help you.
I have been a window for ages.
Am I going to sleep
with other man tonight?
Mom, if yes, congratulations.
No kidding!
Since I can still stand it,
go and take the golden chain first.
Move!
Wait!
We haven't masked ourselves.
Robbery! Remove your pants.
No!
Take off your golden chain!
How dare you pretend to be sleeping?
Kill him!
Are you scared?
He is asleep.
Forget about him, take off his trousers.
No! I mean the chain.
Hurry up! Hurry!
I know!
Who are you?
Negro!
Son, kill him!
Take him away too!
Still fighting?
My son!
Mom!
My son!
Son! Let's go!
I feel tired!
What are you doing?
Someone has just come to
rob your golden chain.
My golden chain is
the treasure of my family,
who dares rob it?
I know who did it.
What do you want?
Someone went into Master's bedroom,
they wanted to rob his golden chain.
Why don't you go and protect him,
but come to my room?
I suspect that
you are one of the thieves.
You come into my room now,
you may say anything you like.
Stop pretending!
I believe that you are still
wearing the night suit.
Behave yourself!
I used to sleep without clothes,
I am nude.
Don't you think I will believe it?
To prove I am innocent,
I will show you.
I count three, 1, 2, 3.
You are great!
I tell you,
once I am working for Mr. Ma.
I won't let you mess up in this place.
You may frame me as you wish.
Why don't you see my body?
Alright, I will prove it
one more time, I will count three.
1, 2, 3!
I warn you,
you'd better disappear at once.
You think that I am nude!
Shit! Where is my mom?
I am your dream lover.
Come on!
I am bored!
I am bored! I am bored!
Why don't you go out to play?
It's great,
but one of us should stay behind.
Who should stay?
Me? I won't stay here.
- Let's play game to determine it!
- Fine!
Wait, we have something to talk,
come here...
What trick will they play?
Scissors!
Alright, come one!
One, two, three!
You lost, stay here!
Let's go out to play!
Granny, why did you cheat me?
Didn't you know
ghost loves telling lies?
Why do you cheat me?
If I didn't cheat you!
How could you stay with me?
Where are you going to?
It's none of your business, sit down.
Listen,
I am going out to search for food.
I'll take your share too.
Great! I want a big chicken ass.
Sure!
Bastard, you want to take advantage
from both of us?
I will make your drunk
tonight.
Congratulations...
Master Hung!
Why don't you take your son out
to join them?
I am responsible to watch the bride.
Anyone wants to rob the bride?
No, I am worrying the bride
will go out and rob.
Everyone is insane here.
I should think something.
Dad, someone is on the roof top.
Man Ting, let's stay calm.
Our target is the one inside,
if she doesn't move we won't move.
I know!
Let me go, don't let me go!
You will be trapped.
Indecent assault!
So what?
Shit, dad is trapped.
Indecent assault!
Madam! Madam!
Master!
What's the matter?
He...
You bastard, how dare you
indecent assault my wife?
Master, I have no face to live.
How dare you
do such thing?
Go! Go now!
Alright, I am leaving.
Don't let him go.
You asked your son to be your guard?
Man Ting, let's go!
Why don't you beat him?
Can you make it?
I can't!
Help Master to the bed for a rest!
Master, be careful!
Dad, why didn't you explain?
No need of explanation, for something,
you need no explanation.
Do you love Miss Red Bean?
Bull shit!
You taught me that,
stay calm for every change.
But, when you heard her screaming,
you changed.
Man Ting, I...
No need of explanation, for something,
no one will believe any explanation.
The soldiers are hurrying
to Ma's villa.
What are you thinking?
I want to save my brothers.
You are righteous.
What are you doing here?
Why do you kill?
We send a troop to arrest few kids,
if this news is spread, it'll harm
the reputation of His Majesty.
So, keep this as secret.
Ma Kai Sin kept the wanted criminal,
it's a severe crime,
his tribe be killed,
the guests of him are
considered as his tribe.
Listen, other than the kids under 10,
no one should be alive.
Kill!
So great! He is easily killed!
Help!
Don't go!
Please lend it to me!
I am dying!
Let's pretend dying too!
I am dying!
Go some place else!
None of your business!
Can't we die together?
But you'd better die properly.
You copy cat,
you copy cat too,
you are not creative enough.
How can a dead people cry?
You love pretending dying, Alright,
I will make your wish come true.
A dead body pissed?
You bastards,
you don't know how to
hold your breath at all!
I will be dragged down by you.
Do you still want to pretend dying?
No, I quit, please let me go!
Stop!
Why are you still here?
But, I love you!
You bastard! Don't go!
Hung Hey-kwun!
You are looking for death!
Why do you slaughter here?
I will tell you in jail!
Alright, Fight!
Kidding? Why there is a fight?
I'd better take something and leave.
I am lucky!
Pay me!
Tai Hung, go,
the soldiers are coming.
Help! Monster!
Why are you still staying here?
Hurry up!
Master Hung!
Hung Hey Kwun,
do you still remember me?
Your Ma Ling Yee?
Can't you believe I am still alive?
I suffered from the poisonous juice,
because I want to kill you
by my own hands.
You made yourself the poisonous man?
Your master Chi Sin was killed
by him.
It's true,
I am the student of Shaolin,
Master Chi Sin tattooed a map
on our back,
which locates the Ming treasure.
Four of my fellow classmates
are caught.
Take my son away!
Go!
Search!
Yes!
My dear boyfriend,
I am your dream lover, you are fainted,
I can't take you away.
See you in the temple
if we have a chance.
You've waken up?
You are seriously hurt.
If I didn't save you, you will die.
So, you have seen everything.
I have no choice!
You bullied me!
I am a virgin,
how can I marry in future?
If you want me to be responsible,
I will marry you.
Why should I marry you?
You don't even care your own son.
You have no fellows,
you are wanted.
This is my first time,
you didn't bring me to
a high class hotel,
but brought me
to such temple!
I am cold,
and you warm yourself only!
Shut up!
Just one word, marry me or not?
Yes!
Think over,
I am going to save my son.
Why didn't you save him before hand?
If I didn't let them catch Man Ting,
I would have no clues to
save the other 4 children.
4 children?
5 kids went out from Shaolin,
they have a big secret,
On the Lunar New Year's Eve,
I've to send them to Nu's Village,
we've a date with Mr. Chan Kan Nam,
head of heaven and Earth Asso.
That means.
Man Ting will leave some codes
on the way.
That's my plan.
I misunderstood you.
I know you are not a coward.
How dare you?
You've taken so much advantage!
Mom, you mean he is
taking my advantage?
No, I am talking about me.
My mom, the corpse in the kitchen.
Why don't you dress up?
And there is blood!
I am hurt by the dart,
luckily he saved me.
Thank you!
He sucked the poisoned blood out
for me.
Suck the poisoned out?
Yes, he has used his greatest effort.
Look...
Look at your face,
you deliberately let him do so.
Mr. Hung, I want to talk to you.
Come on.
You've taken advantage of
my daughter, you have to marry her,
and give me $88000.
Mom, he doesn't seem rich.
What do you think?
Really not.
You just have money in your mind?
No, besides money,
I also like gold, jade,
pearl and diamond
Do you have them?
Everybody has righteous in his mind,
you have it too.
You just don't want to face it.
I don't know what you are talking.
I want to save the kids,
I want you to help me.
Any award?
Are you going? If you don't go,
I won't pay your living.
Are you threatening me?
I won't go, I will never go.
Let's search the entrance
of the prison.
It's too easy!
Just threaten any guy with a sword,
he'll tell everything.
So, you go ahead!
Wow! You respect me so much!
I think I should not depend on you
in future.
Don't move!
Do you want to save them out?
Not that easy!
Nothing would scare me,
but a man with make-up would do.
Turn back and take a look!
It'll be too foolish of I look back.
I am looking, finished.
The other side please!
Sorry, I won't bother you.
I'd better go now.
Help!
That cosmetician man hanged me up
with no good intention.
My chicken son-in-law,
why don't you come to save me?
Is my dad her son-in-law?
My dad is called Chicken too.
Man Ting, step aside!
Hurry up!
- Dad!
- Go now! I am going to save granny.
Hurry up... help me!
Go!
Why are there so many dead people?
They are killed by my dad.
Your dad is too smart,
I want to become your dad's god-son.
Why not be my god-son?
Let's go! Hurry!
Let's climb over the wall!
Let's climb over the wall!
Help me!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Help!
Brother, save me!
How are you?
Bastard, how dare you escape?
Do you remember what I've told you?
Yes!
No Shadow Kick!
Human Wheel!
Be careful!
Let's go!
Got you!
Why do you leave me behind?
I am scared!
Where is my dad?
Hung, you can never leave here.
I know I can't kill you.
But, I will take revenge
for Shaolin anyway.
By what?
By this, let's die together.
Dad!
Dad!
Go now, forget about me.
No! Let's go together!
Go!
Let's die together.
Go now!
Dad!
Monster!
Man Ting!
Man Ting!
Man Ting!
- Dad!
- Man Ting!
Man Ting!
Shit!
What a obscure village!
Uncle, may I know
where the Red Flower Pavilion is?
Don't ask that old food,
look at him,
he seems to be so foolish.
He may be dumb and deaf.
What are you talking, bitch?
I have been living here for 30 years.
I've never heard of
Red Flower Pavilion.
Go away!
There must be one,
I went there 10 years ago.
Master Chi Sin said,
Master Chi Kai is
living in the village.
I've never heard of any Chi Kai.
You have weird temper.
There is another weird person here.
He is living in a strange house
which is nearby.
He dresses himself like a foreigner.
And he is doing waxen statue all day.
In his house, it's so horrible,
no one dares to go in.
Anybody here?
Here's so gloomy and scary!
Yeah! I wouldn't dare to come alone.
There are so many people.
Alright!
Why aren't these people moving?
Exactly! It's so strange!
Old fool, you walk fast!
So healthy are you!
They are all made by wax!
They seem to be real.
He's got that too.
And this too?
Have you finished?
Damn you why don't you move?
You scared me!
This is my house!
I love doing whatever I want.
I can walk in nude too.
You can't do the same,
. Because you have ugly body.
What are you doing?
Is Master Chi Kai here?
It's not a temple,
are there anybody with bald head?
You'd better leave, don't bother me
from doing the waxen statue.
Are they all made by you?
They look real.
Because under the wax,
there is real human flesh.
Do you want to be one?
No!
Since Master Chi Kai isn't here,
we'd better leave.
You are hurt.
I am a doctor,
I can cure you, let me try.
I don't want to bother you,
I've to go to some place else.
Where are you doing?
This village is so obscure,
where do you want to go?
We have to go to Red Flower Pavilion.
Red Flower Pavilion?
It's ruined.
Follow the little path to the south,
that's it.
Thank you, mister.
Don't call me mister,
call me Waxen Maker Cheung.
Waxen Maker Cheung?
Fatty, if you want to make
a waxen statue, come to me.
I don't want it!
There isn't any red flower,
how can it be called
Red Flower Pavilion?
I'll go and ask.
No need, it is the place.
I came here once,
there were red flowers
all over the trees.
Now, it's ruined.
Where is Mr. Chan Kan Nam?
Is it Lunar New Year's Eve?
They will come.
He is a trustworthy man,
and he is always punctual.
Go out and take a look.
Alright, we are leaving.
The sun is setting,
if they don't come,
but the monster arrives, that's shit.
Shit!
There are many swordsmen coming.
Red Bean, go now!
We have to go together.
You are go now!
We are the Youth Society of
the Heaven and Earth Asso.
He is coming.
Hey-kwun, how are you?
Mr. Chan...
You are hurt!
He is hurt by Ma Ling Yee.
Ma Ling Yee? Isn't he killed by you?
Not yet, he is saved by
the Monk of the Western District.
Now, he made himself a Poisonous Man.
He is invincible.
If you meet him, you'd be careful.
Right! The monster is melting,
he always stay inside the car,
he is so horrible.
Don't worry,
I have brought
an invincible sword with me,
with this sword,
every metal will be
chopped into pieces.
Well, I love this!
Handle this place now.
We'd better leave now.
Mom!
We've prepared a safe place for you.
You may take a rest.
That's very good.
This one is...
Stop pretending,
don't you recognise me?
20 years ago,
I was the Miss Beauty,
of the world of martial arts,
when I chose my husband from
Kung-fu competition, you were late,
otherwise,
you would have become the winner.
Really?
You missed the chance.
Thank God!
Go and take a rest!
Yes, Master. This way please!
I will treat you dinner,
remember to come.
Do you need to be so nervous?
They haven't come yet?
They bother us from
having Lunar New Year's Eve dinner.
Shut up!
Spread...
Take the sword to me.
Lie down,
it's my mom who's playing with them.
I really appreciate it.
I use to deceive people with my mom
and never felt happy.
But, since I'm with you.
I feel much secure and happy.
I'll deceive no more again.
Then, where do you plan to go?
You know, wherever you,
I go with you.
Eat the bananas first,
we are just waiting for Mr. Chan.
We will eat when he arrives.
Granny,
you promised to tell us your story.
I were so great,
I was called
the Thousand Hands Avalokitesvara.
I was good at receiving darts.
Once a monk wanted to kill me.
He threw 300 darts to attack me.
I closed my hands.
I collected 298 darts,
and there was one between my lips.
But there was one left.
Fool, the last one,
was clipped by my toes.
Kidding,
why don't you believe me?
I will show you,
if there is a chance.
You will be all eyes.
Granny, I won't believe it!
Ghost!
What's the matter? Where is it?
He is Mister Chan!
The kids are waiting for you
to have dinner,
come on, let's eat.
Bravo!
Mister Chan!
Where else can you escape?
I will never go.
I am too tired to go.
How can I go with these burdens?
I will help you to arrest all of them,
please be merciful...
Damn you!
With so much people?
Go!
Son-in-law you take care of here,
I will take them away.
Let's go!
Granny, Hurry up!
Change my form!
Granny, you are great.
Now, you believe my story?
You are very smart!
You are really great!
I have under estimated you.
Sir, you are so kind that,
why don't you let us go?
Well, since you are woman,
I will give you three chance.
I will receive your dart with mouth.
Don't scare me, I haven't any dart!
Attack!
What?
Isn't my saliva delicious?
Granny, you are great,
can you teach me that?
No problem!
You shouldn't despise me!
Wow! Granny, you are bravo!
Mom! Mom! Are you alright?
Of course not!
I am powerful,
tell her how great I were.
Take them away first,
I'll follow you.
I've to check whether that bastard
needs another lesson or not.
Come as soon as possible.
I know!
Come on, we will leave first!
Sister Red Bean,
granny is so powerful.
Right!
Mom!
You said you were alright!
I am really old.
Granny, you'll be alright.
I couldn't catch the killing dart!
Mom, I will ask someone to cure you.
Do you are the greatest heroine.
No, you are the greatest heroine.
Don't cry!
Red Bean, am I wonderful?
You are great, you are the first beauty
in the world of martial arts.
How dare you cheat me again?
No!
Granny...
Alright, don't cry!
I can't die, help me up!
Granny, be careful!
Cheung, come and save her,
where are you?
Mom! Mom!
Cheung, come and save her.
Daughter, it's cold tonight!
Mom, I will take you there.
Let's go and find Cheung.
Mom, how are you?
Mom, do you feel better? Mom?
I always pretend to be dead.
Now, I am going to die, it's real.
You won't die... don't be big mouth.
Let me say something.
The booties are put inside,
the wall which is behind the cabinet.
I always fight with you for more, because
I am afraid you will be a spendthrift.
You can't save your dowry.
Mom!
You are lucky!
Hung will be a good husband.
Mom! Mom!
Cheung, come out and save my mom!
Red Bean! Red Bean!
I am here, I am here, mom!
It's so dark,
ask the kids not to play candle.
Right, I will tell them not playing.
No, let me hold you for a while.
I tell you a secret.
I did sleep with that old bluffer
that night.
Red Bean, that old bluffer...
Mom!
Granny!
How are you?
Brother, go now.
Mom, let's go!
Granny is dead, let's go!
Mom, I am going!
Hurry! Let's go!
Hurry!
You attack from the top,
I will attack from the bottom.
Man Ting, attack his face,
that is his weakest point.
I got you.
Man Ting! How are you? Man Ting!
Dad!
Who are you?
I am Master Chi Kai of Shaolin,
I've been hiding so long
just until you come out.
Hung Hey-kwun,
go and take care of the kids.
You should be careful.
Ma Ling Yee, you betrayer.
Shaolin is destroyed because of you.
I remained anonymous
and you made the officers after me.
I want to take revenge
for the Shaolin students.
Why didn't you get killed
in the fire?
Sorry, I was bathing.
God wants me to be alive,
so as to kill you.
The Shaolin Mad Dog Fist.
It's okay, stay calm.
- I am scared!
- Let's go!
Help!
Tai Hung!
Hold tight!
Fatty, hold the rope!
I am scared!
I am scared!
Hold it tightly!
It's very high!
Don't panic, Tai Hung, hold the rope.
Don't loose your hand.
My trousers! I am falling!
Tai Hung!
It's time for you to go to hell.
Hung Hey-kwun,
I haven't defeated you before.
But now, I will win, beg me.
Beg me, then I will let you die faster.
Beg me, come on!
- Dad!
- Hey-kwun!
Hey-kwun, how are you?
I die with you!
Hey-kwun!
Man Ting!
Dad!
Man Ting!
Dad!
No Shadow Kick!
Don't loose your hand!
Dad!
Mr. Hung, I am lucky to be alive,
It's just like a dream.
Wu Tak-tai, Choi Tak-chung, Li Si-hoi,
Ma Chiu-hing, Fong Tai-hung.
Your tattoos have been erased
by medicine now.
I'll bring this map
to Heaven and Earth Association.
Go home
with your parents then.
We are leaving.
Okay!
Let's go!
Fong Tai Hung,
is your dad coming to pick you up?
My dad always cheats me.
Why don't you go with me to be a monk?
- No, I won't be monk.
- Tai Hung!
Why don't you follow us to the South?
Fine, I think my dad is not coming.
Tai Hung! My son!
Dad!
- Dad!
- My son!
Are you his dad?
Yes.
I am Hung Hey-kwun.
Are you Hung Hey-kwun? I am Fong Sai-yu.
Fong Sai-yu?
What's the matter?
Tai Hung, take care!
Don't take them as example,
it'll harm you.
Dad, don't cheat me again.
No, I won't cheat you.
Dad!
This is the first time I have seen
you laughing, it's good looking.
Mom, let's go!
