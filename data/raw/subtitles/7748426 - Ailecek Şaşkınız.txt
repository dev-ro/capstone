{\an8}APRIL 23, 1994
YALOVA
{\an8}I wish children would rule the world.
{\an2}I give up my office for one day
to children who are our future.
{\an2}For today, our District Governor will be
Ferhat and his assistant will be Gokhan.
{\an8}And the world becomes a better place
for one day.
{\an2}Move, move.
{\an2}Handsome, go get me a cup of tea.
{\an8}Right away, Mr. District Governor.
Where is the tea maker?
{\an8}Since I have the office now, you can
take your leave, Mr. District Governor.
{\an2}I'm in control now.
{\an2}Thank you for your service.
{\an2}Security, do your job.
{\an8}Are we going to wait for him to leave
all day? He's sitting right there.
{\an8}What is going on?
{\an8}As you can see, people,
we just literally took over a chaos.
{\an2}I'm saying this to those who are tenured
and think they are safe.
{\an8}If you're not willing to work,
{\an8}you should better go and find a new job.
{\an8}I need hardworking employees
more than anything else.
{\an8}Exactly Mr. District Governor.
There are 200 people working here,
{\an8}but still there is not even a tea shop.
{\an8}If you all take turns at making tea
each day,
{\an2}how much money
would we keep in our vault?
{\an8}If each of them had
two cups of tea each day,
{\an8}we would save three million liras per day.
{\an2}That is a nice amount of cash these days.
A treasure if you know how to use it.
{\an8}You can take care of your family
with that amount of money.
{\an8}Who am I talking to, though?
He's giving me a blank look.
{\an2}What are you looking at?
{\an8}That is enough shooting for today.
Reporters, out!
{\an8}Where did you find these kids?
{\an2}Sir, he's my boy.
I think he got excited.
{\an2}-He's not one of us.
-No, he's not.
{\an8}Today is our blessed day.
Let’s live a happy life.
{\an8}APRIL 23, 1994
BURSA
{\an8}Today is April, 23.
Our hearts are filled with joy.
{\an8}Look how she's reading it
nicely, Muzaffer.
{\an8}Well done, my girl.
{\an8}No! She will be an engineer.
{\an8}We cross that bridge
when we come to it.
{\an8}No, she will be an engineer next year.
{\an8}They are doing a nice job.
He's wearing a free costume and props,
{\an8}but we had to pay a lot
for her tailored costume.
{\an8}Stop it, for God's sake.
{\an8}AFTER 10 YEARS
BURSA
{\an8}Muzaffer, it seems like you cut corners
on promotional materials.
{\an8}It wasn’t supposed to be like this, right?
{\an2}What the hell?
{\an2}Anyway,
{\an8}why would we want to show off
with an umbrella?
{\an8}We did it for advertisement, that’s it.
{\an8}Is this place a charity
organization, wife?
{\an8}Her sister is like her also.
{\an2}If I had a bright son,
{\an8}I’d own my own skyscraper today.
{\an8}Ferhat, people are getting restless,
don’t stare at them like that.
{\an8}Right there, we put some mirrors
behind people to see their screens.
{\an8}They look like they are working
but I'm not buying it.
{\an2}They play solitaire
and minesweeper all day.
{\an8}-What is it to you?
-What do you mean, dad?
{\an8}I don’t want to take over a ruin
when I become CEO of this company.
{\an8}Why don’t we expand like
Efe Sultan does?
{\an2}<font color="white">Kirilgan to Atilgan, over.</font>
<font color="white">Kirilgan to Atilgan, over.</font>
{\an2}I have the security cameras
facing the computer screens,
{\an8}and eight people are playing games,
four are reading the news,
{\an8}and three are pretending
like they are working.
{\an8}<font color="white">I noted them down.</font>
<font color="white">These are not workers,</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">they are like dynamites</font>
<font color="white">ready to blow us out.</font>
{\an2}Well, how about that?
Watch out for these two boys, Zeki.
{\an2}They will grow so fast.
{\an2}Invest in these two boys,
not in gold or foreign currency.
{\an8}AND 2018
BURSA
{\an8}How does this happen?
{\an2}It boggles my mind.
{\an2}There has to have an explanation.
{\an2}All those scientists and thinkers
should say something already!
{\an2}It is It is a work of art.
{\an2}How can two mortals come together
and create something like this?
{\an2}This is literally a divine signal.
{\an2}I will jinx myself,
look at that beauty!
{\an2}Magnificent.
{\an2}Yes. Why am I being disturbed?
{\an2}Our employees do not want
to work overtime, Mr. Ferhat.
{\an2}"Want"?
What kind of word is that?
{\an2}Back then, you’d have to fight with a lion
to make a living.
{\an2}Now, there are no more
lions roaming around.
{\an2}What do you mean
you don’t want to work overtime?
{\an2}But sir, I'm pregnant.
{\an2}Did I come from a tree hole, my friend?
{\an2}Wasn’t my mother pregnant with me?
{\an2}We’ve been there,
but that hasn’t delayed our work ethics.
{\an2}-But this is so hard for us, Mr. Gokhan.
-Say again?
{\an2}This is so hard for us, Mr. Gokhan.
{\an2}It is hard for me too.
{\an2}As the financial director
of this company,
{\an2}it is very hard for me to pay you
millions of liras every single month.
{\an2}When payday comes,
I go home and cry.
{\an2}But you don’t pay overtime, Mr. Gokhan.
{\an2}Pardon?
{\an2}But you don’t pay overtime, Mr. Gokhan.
{\an2}Have you done anything in your life
{\an2}without expecting something
in return, Mr. Emre?
{\an2}What kind of people are these, Mr. Ferhat?
{\an2}We have one week to submit a proposal
for a high-value tender.
{\an2}I’ve been asking them to work
overtime to get ready, as a favor.
{\an2}And they want overtime pay in return.
{\an2}When you do a favor,
would you want something in return?
{\an2}Especially from this beauty?
{\an2}At Efe Sultan’s company,
people are paid half of your salaries.
{\an2}They offer sacrifices to their gods
if they get paid on time.
{\an2}Even water is not free in that company.
As for our company...
{\an2}there is no water.
{\an2}But we allow you
to bring your own water from outside.
{\an2}With our permission.
What else should we do?
{\an2}We are the only company with a paid
parking lot. We can’t drive to work.
{\an2}This is the point, my friend.
{\an2}We all need oxygen.
{\an2}Use public transports.
{\an2}How can everything be free?
{\an2}-Is this your father’s company?
-No, sir.
{\an2}But it is my father’s.
{\an2}I fired my own father from his own company
because of he was slacking off work!
{\an2}Work discipline is crucial!
{\an2}We need hard-working employees
more than anything!
{\an2}My father is coming.
{\an2}Remember that work and family
are separate things.
{\an2}Respect your father.
Let this be an example for you.
{\an2}Now, get back to work.
{\an2}You, have those tattoos erased!
This is not Detroit.
{\an2}Welcome, father.
I wish you’ve told me you were coming.
{\an2}I'm shaking your hand because
I don’t want to embarrass you
{\an2}in front of your employees.
Go to your office! We need to talk.
{\an2}Yes, sir.
{\an2}Sure, I can give you five minutes.
Since you're my father.
{\an2}Weren’t we a good role model
for you, son?
{\an2}Why do you go and choose Goliath
{\an2}as a role model?
Are you an imbecile, son?
{\an2}Won’t you let me have
a peaceful retirement?
{\an2}-It was my time for fishing!
-What happened, dad?
{\an2}Are these people your slaves?
{\an2}Today is Sunday, you fool,
and everyone is here!
{\an2}Why don’t you give them a holiday?
{\an2}They don’t even want it, daddy.
{\an2}They don’t want to give up
this peaceful work environment.
{\an2}Zip it, don’t lie to me!
{\an2}Be honest with me,
{\an2}since we are a bigger company now,
and things are going pretty well
{\an2}after your retirement,
are you a little bit jealous?
{\an2}Would Geppetto be jealous of Pinocchio?
{\an2}You piece of wood!
{\an2}Why would I be jealous of you?
{\an2}Father, as you know,
{\an2}I’ve made this company two times
bigger in a year.
{\an2}As your mother know,
{\an2}I made you in the back seat
of the car in four minutes.
{\an2}Am I bragging about this?
{\an2}These people have lives
and families, son.
{\an2}Show some understanding.
{\an2}If necessary, take their work load
and do it by yourself.
{\an2}A manager would even mop
his own office floor if need be.
{\an2}With all those windows, dad?
People would see me mopping the floor.
{\an2}I won’t embarrass myself by letting them
see me cleaning my office.
{\an2}I never saw you clean your own office.
Give me a break.
{\an2}You think I would be ashamed of that?
Let them see, I don’t care.
{\an2}-Where are the bucket and the mop?
-There, in the cabinet.
{\an2}Watch me now.
{\an2}That is not beneath me.
Maybe this will be a lesson for you.
{\an2}I will be right back.
{\an2}Listen to me, all of you!
When it comes to my work,
{\an2}I won't make concessions
even to my own father.
{\an2}He begged me to hire him again.
{\an2}I said, no.
{\an2}He said, “I can’t look after your mother,
I’d even mop the floors if I have to.”
{\an2}There!
{\an2}You see him with your own eyes.
My old man is mopping the floor.
{\an2}Mr. Ferhat, what are you doing?
He's your father.
{\an2}This was his company in the first place.
{\an2}And he had to work really hard!
{\an2}This is not a charity organization!
{\an2}Anyway,
{\an2}I'm a considerate person.
{\an2}After all, he's my father.
I should give him another job.
{\an2}He can’t do it right anyway.
{\an2}Do I have to teach him everything?
{\an2}That’s not how you do it.
I will do it myself.
{\an2}Leave it, dad.
What are you doing?
{\an2}Get back to work!
{\an2}Dad, what are you doing?
{\an2}I understand my mistakes.
I won’t do them again, I promise.
{\an2}Well, bravo.
This is a progress, anyway.
{\an2}If they can’t do their jobs,
I would do it for them!
{\an2}That’s it!
{\an2}Don’t make me come here again.
{\an2}Don’t let him be your role model.
{\an2}Race with yourself,
not with other people.
{\an2}Dad, he's doing it on purpose.
{\an2}On the 50th floor, no one would see
his billboard but me.
{\an2}He won’t let me forget about him.
{\an2}-Give me some water. I'm tired.
-Sure.
{\an2}<font color="white">I know what You're thinking.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">There is nothing to love about this man.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">I'm not happy with my past either.</font>
{\an2}Here you go, daddy.
{\an2}<font color="white">He has no idea what</font>
<font color="white">future holds for him yet.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">Yet.</font>
{\an2}LEFTOVERS TO THOSE IN NEED
{\an2}Sister, have you read the news?
{\an2}I have.
{\an2}Have you read the comments below?
{\an2}Comments?
{\an2}My father put a comment below it.
{\an2}“Instead of thinking what to do
with leftovers,
{\an2}think about how we could sell all of them
without any leftovers
{\an2}so our parents
wouldn’t have to work all the time.”
{\an2}That is nothing,
{\an2}here comes the killing blow.
Read the rest, he wrote it nicely.
{\an2}“There are kids who would take Istanbul
and make it a part of their empire,
{\an2}and there are kids who use
their father’s retirement pension.
{\an2}I hope God wouldn’t test parents
with their kids.”
{\an2}To be honest, I've got the best part.
{\an2}He paid my loans with his retirement
pension last month.
{\an2}Anyway, I'm going to work.
{\an2}Mom!
{\an2}Dad changed his relationship
status on Facebook to “complicated.”
{\an2}Well, he sold his car then.
{\an2}He was going to sell his car.
Good for him.
{\an2}What is that? Are you talking
with him in codes?
{\an2}He thinks it is a joke.
He says he got the money.
{\an2}And it is only 10,000 liras.
Better than nothing, though.
{\an2}God knows that if he had more than that,
it would corrupt him.
{\an2}I have become used to it.
{\an2}It is nothing compared to other people
I’ve seen in years.
{\an2}Hang on, here comes the baby.
It’ll be over soon.
{\an2}Muzaffer, the baby is here.
{\an2}My baby.
{\an2}Wait a second.
{\an2}Give me the scissors,
I will cut the cord.
{\an2}Doc, it is not working.
{\an2}Doc, we need to find a solution.
{\an2}I'm saying that it is not working.
{\an2}Didn’t you take the Hippocratic oath?
{\an2}It is cold here!
{\an2}The baby will be sick!
Give me something.
{\an2}Well done, here we go.
{\an2}Applause!
{\an2}Damn you, Muzaffer.
{\an2}<font color="white">This is not because of poverty.</font>
{\an2}Or stinginess.
{\an2}Maybe greed.
{\an2}Yes, he's greedy.
{\an2}Your father is a greedy man.
He's insatiable.
{\an2}Your late grandfather knew what a prick
Muzaffer was the moment he saw him.
{\an2}He wasn’t about to give his permission
{\an2}for our marriage.
They barely convinced him.
{\an2}I have only one daughter,
{\an2}and I want a countryside wedding.
{\an2}That would be a waste, sir. A waste.
{\an2}Since we are in bad terms
with most of our relatives,
{\an2}we won’t be having many guests.
{\an2}Let’s have a ballroom wedding.
{\an2}We’ve been stuck in the same topic
since morning. I'm tired.
{\an2}Let’s flip a coin.
{\an2}Let fate decide for us.
{\an2}Okay, let’s do it.
{\an2}If it is tails, countryside wedding.
{\an2}Shame on you.
{\an2}Whoever took it, give it back.
{\an2}This is literally a robbery.
{\an2}What’s that got to do with it?
{\an2}I just found a coin in the air.
{\an2}Do you own the air?
Do you have the title deed for it?
{\an2}But what is the reason for me
to take the lira?
{\an2}What was my intention?
{\an2}That one lira is gone.
They took it from my pocket.
{\an2}This is the actual robbery!
{\an2}You're my son.
{\an2}These kind of things happen between us.
{\an2}Mom, you're still in love
with my father, though.
{\an2}Yes, Otherwise, it would be unbearable.
{\an2}Why are you running?
What is it?
{\an2}Who am I talking to?
{\an2}It looks much more with all the 20 liras.
{\an2}I should take a picture
and post it in Facebook.
{\an2}They will be so jealous.
{\an2}Those coyotes,
they left me here as a bait.
{\an2}Mr. Gokhan!
{\an2}Yes, boss!
{\an2}Bring me that guy who opposed me.
{\an2}The one who said I don't pay overtime.
{\an2}I am dealing with the source of problem!
{\an2}Come with me. Move. Move!
{\an2}Get back to your work!
Don’t eavesdrop!
{\an2}Do you count on your friends?
{\an2}Talk to my face, now!
{\an2}Don’t shit where you eat, right?
{\an2}Close the door, Gokhan!
{\an2}Who do you think you are?
{\an2}Whoever you think you are, Emre?
You're more than that.
{\an2}You can’t even imagine how valuable
you are to this company.
{\an2}I'm really afraid they will
figure out that I'm a snitch.
{\an2}How would they figure it out?
They are not even suspicious.
{\an2}You're hanging out with them
after work, right?
{\an2}Do they call us names behind our backs?
{\an2}If we don't receive enough swearing,
I feel like our work is incomplete.
{\an2}They are so creative about that.
{\an2}They swore at all of your relatives
{\an2}with no exceptions.
{\an2}They didn’t miss anyone.
But your midwife took the lead on this.
{\an2}Okay, don’t praise us anymore.
My ego is off the charts right now.
{\an2}Mr. Ferhat, can we put an end to this?
{\an2}-If I get caught, they will--
-No way, Emre.
{\an2}Even dogs don’t shit where they eat.
Even dogs--
{\an2}Just get closer to each other.
They can see me between you two.
{\an2}Why would you get caught?
In their eyes, you're just a miserable
{\an2}and useless employee
who cleans my office every morning.
{\an2}Would snitches clean desks?
{\an2}We won’t get caught.
{\an2}Even I don’t have the keys for this room.
{\an2}I would clean it, though,
if I was asked
{\an2}Get out of here!
{\an2}Get out, before you get yourself fired.
{\an2}Be thankful that
we didn’t break your face.
{\an2}Shameless!
{\an2}I'm feeling good right now.
{\an2}Send them home after lunch.
{\an2}We will go home and work together.
{\an2}Let’s work hard to finish the proposal.
So Efe Sultan...
{\an2}Hey there.
{\an2}WELCOME BOSS
WE WOULD DIE FOR YOU
{\an2}FREE FOOD SERVICE
OPEN
{\an2}Pull yourself together.
We need to work.
{\an2}I'm fine now, thanks Gokhan.
{\an2}More coffee?
{\an2}What have you done?
Did you eat the coffee?
{\an2}If we drink it,
we have to go to the toilet.
{\an2}This is much better. Crispy.
{\an2}Well done, good thinking.
{\an2}My hands and feet are numb already.
{\an2}I don’t know where my mouth is.
{\an2}I poured down the last two cups.
{\an2}It was already cold.
{\an2}You've just lost one of your senses.
{\an2}You've burned yourself,
didn’t you feel that, man?
{\an2}No.
{\an2}I can’t sniff it either.
{\an2}So I've lost two senses.
{\an2}Your eyes are twitching as well.
{\an2}It is weird, though,
they are still functional.
{\an2}We haven’t slept like, three days.
{\an2}Yes, let’s keep working.
{\an2}<font color="white">There is a report for Park Street,</font>
<font color="white">number four.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">If you're close to the vicinity,</font>
<font color="white">pay a visit.</font>
{\an2}Girl, what kind of person are you?
You're off duty right now.
{\an2}But it is my station.
{\an2}What is that?
{\an2}Well, I'll take your car.
{\an2}So it was nothing.
{\an2}Is the proposal finished?
{\an2}What is the total cost?
{\an2}Three.
{\an2}At the meeting,
{\an2}when they ask us what our bid is
{\an2}for Bursa’s largest residential complex,
{\an2}with 800 flats,
are we going to say "three"?
{\an2}They would hand the project to us
just out of curiosity.
{\an2}-What the hell is three, man?
-I made an error in calculation, I guess.
{\an2}You haven’t calculated anything yet.
Three is just one number!
{\an2}Calculations are done
by using the numbers.
{\an2}What is that?
{\an2}Why there is a cat in the house?
{\an2}Close the windows!
{\an2}We talked about this.
There is no cat.
{\an2}It is a hallucination.
{\an2}It is normal.
{\an2}I just saw a man going to bedroom.
{\an2}It was so real, Gokhan.
{\an2}The cat looked at me, blinked and said,
“What have you done for Allah today?”
{\an2}-Cat?
-Said?
{\an2}You've also lost two of your senses:
your eyes and ears.
{\an2}What are we going to do?
{\an2}We will join forces.
{\an2}You will use my eyes and ears,
{\an2}and I will use your skin
and nose.
{\an2}-What was the fifth sense?
-Tongue.
{\an2}Well, let’s not use each other’s tongues.
{\an2}This conversation is going to
a really bad place.
{\an2}<font color="white">Here's a piece of advice. Don’t walk</font>
<font color="white">around the house in your underwear.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">Love could be at your doorstep</font>
<font color="white">when you less expect it.</font>
{\an2}I guess it is room service.
Do you have any change on you?
{\an2}This is a house, not a hotel.
{\an2}You're scaring me.
Sit down.
{\an2}-Who is it?
-<font color="white">The police.</font>
{\an2}Get up, why are you sitting?
She says, the police.
{\an2}The police?
{\an2}The police?
{\an2}Bro, I swear I haven’t stolen anything.
Don’t give me to the cops.
{\an2}Fuck me.
What the fuck?
{\an2}It wasn’t a hallucination, Ferhat.
{\an2}I get that.
{\an2}There wasn’t anyone in there
when I went to the bedroom.
{\an2}No, bro, we looked at each
other in there,
{\an2}you gave me a tip and left.
{\an2}There was a doorbell, I heard it.
Didn’t you hear it?
{\an2}Bro, sorry for interrupting,
{\an2}but I haven’t heard anything.
Are you sure?
{\an2}Are you okay, guys?
{\an2}What? Behind me?
{\an2}Behind me.
{\an2}You’re good.
{\an2}Would you also want me to open the door?
{\an2}Captain Elif.
Weren’t you off duty?
{\an2}Take him. Go.
Take him to the car.
{\an2}Don’t change his shape,
he’d fit into the trunk just like this.
{\an2}I made sure of it.
{\an2}She folded him like he was
an ironing board.
{\an2}She shrunk his body.
{\an2}It is not a hallucination then.
You also saw what I saw, right?
{\an2}What? Behind me?
{\an2}Behind me.
{\an2}Yeah, I saw it.
What was that?
{\an2}I see beyond, and it is not finished.
{\an2}Yes, yes, yes!
{\an2}Ferhat, stop. I haven’t asked yet!
{\an2}Yes, yes, yes!
{\an2}Yes, yes, yes!
{\an2}Yes, yes, yes!
{\an2}<font color="white">I didn’t believe in love at first sight.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">Scientifically speaking,</font>
<font color="white">it wouldn’t be possible otherwise.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">Love happens at first sight.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">But some of us can’t realize it</font>
<font color="white">until some time into the relationship.</font>
{\an2}Guys, you're awake,
{\an2}didn't you notice the burglar?
{\an2}We may have noticed him.
It is kind of complicated.
{\an2}We were working.
{\an2}Ferhat. Ferhat!
{\an2}Captain, we're sorry
we opened the door in underwear.
{\an2}I’ve seen people without underwear.
Don’t worry.
{\an2}Hikmet!
{\an2}Sorry, Captain Elif.
{\an2}But we saw it.
{\an2}Ma’am, we were working
right over there,
{\an2}and started staring in this direction,
when we heard the door.
{\an2}Since we have two exits...
Gokhan, give that to me.
{\an2}Check your belongings.
{\an2}If anything is missing,
call this number.
{\an2}-Have a good night.
-Good night.
{\an2}We literally saw the burglar,
but we couldn’t even say something.
{\an2}We are not fine.
Should we sleep?
{\an2}No, man, I'm totally fine.
{\an2}Very well. What's just happened?
{\an2}Suddenly, the screen went dark--
{\an2}I'm calling the ambulance.
{\an2}What is it, Gokhan?
{\an2}First, what happened?
Second, who are you calling?
{\an2}Ferhat, you're scaring me.
If you continue to black out like this--
{\an2}I'm calling.
{\an2}Calling whom?
{\an2}Enough!
{\an2}Say what?
{\an2}Why are you playing with my well-being?
{\an2}I should go to that chair
and black out right there.
{\an2}I'm covered with bruises.
{\an2}Go back, back, move.
{\an2}Left, go left. Go, move.
{\an2}Okay, leave it. Leave.
{\an2}Well done.
{\an2}Set the parking brake.
Turn off the flashers.
{\an2}We should have a rear cam.
It is hard to park it.
{\an2}Why did you send the driver home?
He could’ve given me a ride.
{\an2}This is the company’s ambulance.
And you're the CEO of the company.
{\an2}They shouldn’t see you in this state.
It would cause rumors.
{\an2}Got it?
{\an2}Did you just black out again?
{\an2}What kind of hospital is this?
Clean the floors!
{\an2}-I have a cigarette butt in my mouth.
-It is your father’s hospital, quiet.
{\an2}Come lean on my shoulder.
{\an2}What am I going to do with you?
{\an2}Wow, was I just snoring?
{\an2}I woke up to it.
{\an2}He came around, doc. He's awake.
{\an2}He was sleeping really deep,
He's awake now.
{\an2}Doctor, nothing serious, I hope?
What is your diagnosis?
{\an2}You're just fine.
It was just a faint.
{\an2}Just a faint?
Is this a medical term?
{\an2}You little... No.
{\an2}Your body is about to expire.
{\an2}You smell like sewer.
{\an2}Your body is crying.
{\an2}You're not that young anymore.
{\an2}When was the last time you
had slept seven hours straight?
{\an2}Last week.
{\an2}How can you mistreat your body
like this? It is your body!
{\an2}If you fill your father’s hospital
with your high school friends,
{\an2}this is how they treat you, Ferhat.
{\an2}Excuse me?
{\an2}Your father’s hospital...
{\an2}-It is self-criticism, Gokhan.
-Sorry.
{\an2}Bro, this is your job.
Why are you acting like this?
{\an2}Go to the Emergency Room then.
{\an2}Why did he have me brought here?
{\an2}This kid has an infection on his penis
caused by circumcision for two days,
{\an2}his penis is swollen.
And that is a medical term.
{\an2}His penis is swollen
and he's in worse condition than you,
{\an2}but he's not complaining.
{\an2}My condition is that bad?
{\an2}Oh, cutie.
{\an2}No, there is nothing to be afraid of.
{\an2}You're totally okay.
Let me check it.
{\an2}What the fuck! What is that?
{\an2}Ferhat, his penis is as large
as half of him.
{\an2}It barely fit into the pot.
{\an2}They made it fit by rotating it.
{\an2}He's not a circumciser,
He's a magician. Come.
{\an2}Grandpa!
{\an2}-His penis talked. It said "grandpa."
-It was the kid who just talked.
{\an2}-I swear, it called me grandpa.
-No, the kid called you grandpa!
{\an2}Why did you make him cry?
{\an2}Look here. Look at this toy.
{\an2}<font color="white">Wild Girl</font>
{\an2}You see?
{\an2}This is real.
{\an2}I promise you,
when you feel better,
{\an2}I will take you to ride this horse.
Okay? Here, take it.
{\an2}Don’t believe him.
He also tricks me like this.
{\an2}-I’ve been waiting for years to ride it.
-He's just a kid.
{\an2}You need to see what is under that pot.
{\an2}Leave it alone.
{\an2}You made him cry again.
Get out.
{\an2}Tell me one more time.
{\an2}-Get out!
-I heard it right then.
{\an2}Not there, use the back door.
{\an2}That was hard work,
{\an2}like a sculptor’s work.
{\an2}My boy, why are you crying?
{\an2}Your mom and aunt were downstairs
{\an2}I went there to bring them here.
We are here, don’t be scared.
{\an2}Muzaffer, I said I was going,
why did you follow me?
{\an2}Oh, sweetie, did you sit here quietly
waiting for your mom?
{\an2}Wow! Look at you, Muzaffer.
{\an2}carrying your grand-kid on your shoulder.
{\an2}What, Hikmet? Are you jealous?
{\an2}When the time comes,
I’d carry you on my shoulder too.
{\an2}I wish you a peaceful death from old age.
And since you're older than me...
{\an2}Dad, what are you doing?
{\an2}What am I doing?
I'm joking with my friend.
{\an2}He's the butcher from our neighborhood.
Didn’t you recognize him?
{\an2}I really don’t like this guy,
you know?
{\an2}He's just cursed.
He doesn’t die, never dies.
{\an2}Even God doesn’t take him by his side.
He's that repulsive.
{\an2}He's my father.
{\an2}Why is this kid crying?
What happened?
{\an2}Mister, it was a joke.
I'm sorry.
{\an2}I'm a friend of Elif, Doctor Onay.
{\an2}You got me there.
{\an2}-May I?
-Go ahead.
{\an2}How are you?
{\an2}I'm fine, fine. Totally fine.
{\an2}I'm glad my future son-in-law
is a doctor.
{\an2}He can look after us when we get old.
{\an2}Dad, come on, please.
{\an2}it is nothing like that.
We are just friends.
{\an2}So, it doesn’t matter.
{\an2}My best friend is your mother.
{\an2}We’ve been sharing everything
for years.
{\an2}He's just started talking again.
I will play possum.
{\an2}You need to be friends first anyway.
{\an2}It is a good thing you know each other,
otherwise it would be a crime.
{\an2}You of all people should know
since you deal with crimes.
{\an2}Sister, please don’t back him up.
{\an2}What are you doing?
I'm driving.
{\an2}Shame on both of you.
What is it to you anyway? Excuse me!
{\an2}Excuse me?
{\an2}My girl, when you marry a guy,
I will call him my son.
{\an2}It is my business also.
I have a right to vote.
{\an2}And he will be my brother in law,
so I use my vote for the doctor.
{\an2}-It works for all of us.
-Exactly!
{\an2}He would prescribe us some antibiotics.
{\an2}They don’t give it without
a prescription, do they, dad?
{\an2}Go on, make fun of me.
{\an2}If you haven’t had a sharp
wit like this...
{\an2}So what? What, dad?
"Your husband wouldn't have divorced you
{\an2}and you wouldn’t stay with us
with your two kids.”
{\an2}-Come on, Say it.
-No way.
{\an2}Why would I say something like that?
{\an2}-Turn right there.
-I know where our house is, dad.
{\an2}Did you see, pretty boy?
{\an2}Even you can be charmed.
{\an2}You shouldn’t brag
about how handsome you are.
{\an2}There are other beauties besides you.
{\an2}Elif Senturk is like “Nikita.”
She's not like the others, Ferhat.
{\an2}I was talking about that
to this handsome man, Gokhan.
{\an2}You have no idea, she is something else.
{\an2}She blew my mind.
{\an2}What is it?
How did you find it?
{\an2}From sources which you're not
supposed to know.
{\an2}You're the CEO, Ferhat Atilgan.
Don’t let it trouble you.
{\an2}Enough with this attitude, man!
{\an2}Ferhat,
{\an2}she's among the most accomplished
police captains in the country.
{\an2}She's completed 29 out of 25 special
missions with great success.
{\an2}Either she doesn’t know math,
or this is so badass
{\an2}that perhaps she also handles other
missions.
{\an2}She loves her job, like me.
What else?
{\an2}See what you need to see.
{\an2}-She's an exemplary person.
-Mother of my future children.
{\an2}She can speak French,
Italian and Urdu.
{\an2}When we take a vacation together,
she can do the talking and I can rest.
{\an2}Nice.
{\an2}You're killing me.
{\an2}Listen, we have worked
really hard for years.
{\an2}We have little time left for the most
important bid of our lives.
{\an2}Pull yourself together.
Is this a right time for romance?
{\an2}What is this restaurant?
{\an2}Her father’s.
{\an2}It is famous for their stews.
{\an2}Captain Elif goes there after her shifts
all the time.
{\an2}-Are you not coming?
-Where to?
{\an2}-I just told you.
-Told me what?
{\an2}We were talking about stews.
{\an2}And Elif might be there.
{\an2}We are going to ask for an address.
{\an2}They will definitely ask for an address,
douchebags. They are just showing off.
{\an2}What is wrong with that car door?
{\an2}-Morning, sir.
-Shut up!
{\an2}Do I look like I'm the chief?
I know nothing about that address.
{\an2}Look, just read there.
{\an2}Please, don’t ask for addresses.
{\an2}Sir, we are from this neighborhood too.
{\an2}We won’t ask for an address.
We are here for something else.
{\an2}Why are we here then?
{\an2}I'm Ferhat, the CEO
of LSI Corporate Group.
{\an2}Our employees eat...
{\an2}in our company's cafeteria.
{\an2}We are here to hire your food services
for our employees.
{\an2}Our intention is also to help out
small businesses.
{\an2}I will be right back.
{\an2}Well, well, well.
Look, who is here.
{\an2}I'm Muzaffer.
{\an2}It smells nice.
{\an2}Green soap?
{\an2}It's cologne, sir.
{\an2}I will be back in a second.
{\an2}I hope he doesn’t hurt us, man.
{\an2}Sorry, what am I, chopped liver?
{\an2}What kind of thing is this?
{\an2}He blew my mind away.
{\an2}If I had a son-in-law
like him,
{\an2}I would be free of trouble.
{\an2}I checked his finger,
{\an2}there was no wedding ring.
{\an2}He also said he uses perfume.
He's a spender.
{\an2}What is going on again, Muzaffer?
{\an2}Be quiet, wife.
{\an2}Luck is at our doorstep right now.
{\an2}God will reward me for all the troubles
I’ve suffered in this life.
{\an2}He won’t make me wait for afterlife.
{\an2}Sir, welcome, welcome.
Here, come inside.
{\an2}Don’t wait outside.
Come inside.
{\an2}Welcome.
{\an2}Please, have a seat.
{\an2}Sir, because of our line of work,
{\an2}we can’t even find two minutes
to sit down and relax.
{\an2}So, why are you here again?
Could you refresh my memory please?
{\an2}We came here to...
{\an2}I wanted to meet you and hire you
to provide food services to my company.
{\an2}Sure. We already service two to three
companies.
{\an2}We got that outfit store right down there
and also a hardware shop.
{\an2}We know how this works.
{\an2}How many people do you have
in your company?
{\an2}About 1,500 employees.
{\an2}Wife,
{\an2}bring my sublingual pill.
I'm having a heart attack!
{\an2}Oh, my God, son, my heart.
{\an2}What do you do for living, my boy?
{\an2}I own that skyscraper.
I own a construction company.
{\an2}You do have a skyscraper, huh?
{\an2}The man of my dreams.
{\an2}Boy. My boy...
{\an2}Are you...
{\an2}the son of Efe Sultan?
{\an2}<font color="white">I'm sad, oh, I'm sad</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">Sleepless at night</font>
{\an2}Would Efe Sultan have the time to get
married and have a son?
{\an2}He's the son of Zeki Atilgan.
{\an2}Is this a parents’ meeting?
{\an2}I'm nobody’s son.
I'm Ferhat.
{\an2}Ferhat, let me be clear.
{\an2}My grandfather took a loan of 10,000
liras from his friend
{\an2}to build a business
and went to Istanbul years ago.
{\an2}Twenty years later, he had to pay back
like $700,000
{\an2}and he was deep in debt.
{\an2}They even took his underwear.
{\an2}He had to sell even his luggage.
{\an2}So we are not good at doing business.
{\an2}I'm going to ask around
and take some advice,
{\an2}then I'm going to give you an offer.
Would that be okay?
{\an2}Of course, sir. We want to help
small businesses.
{\an2}You, perfumed,
{\an2}handsome boy.
{\an2}I like you.
{\an2}Welcome, my girl.
{\an2}Dad, which idiot owns that car?
{\an2}Let him know it will be all scratched
in this neighborhood.
{\an2}We can look after the car.
Don’t worry.
{\an2}I'm not talking about the car.
It is its owner I'm worried about.
{\an2}Why is he here?
{\an2}This is my car,
and we are about to leave.
{\an2}Sorry.
{\an2}Someone parked right in front
of our restaurant,
{\an2}-Lett them know they must move it.
-Enough of this car topic already.
{\an2}It is like we’ve never seen a car before.
{\an2}We sold one yesterday.
{\an2}Damn! This kid...
{\an2}Ms. Elif.
{\an2}He gave me the toy, aunt.
{\an2}-Aunt.
-Mr. Ferhat?
{\an2}My God, you two know each other?
{\an2}Yes, sir, we owe her our thanks.
{\an2}-Is he better now?
-He is, thank you.
{\an2}Why are you here?
{\an2}We are here to get an offer
from Mr. Muzaffer.
{\an2}It looks like he's really good at his job.
{\an2}Don’t you have employees
for this kind of meeting?
{\an2}Of course I do.
I have thousands.
{\an2}But, I can’t trust them, can I?
{\an2}I do the meetings in person
with people I'm going to work with.
{\an2}Anyway, I don’t want to waste
your time any longer.
{\an2}Mr. Muzaffer, we will be in touch.
{\an2}I hope so.
{\an2}Have all a nice day.
You're so cute.
{\an2}What do you want to be
when you grow up?
{\an2}A pain in the ass!
{\an2}I got my answer.
{\an2}Crazy kid!
{\an2}So you two know each other, huh?
I can die happily right now.
{\an2}I caught a burglar in his house,
that is all. I don’t know him personally.
{\an2}You don’t need to know him.
It takes time.
{\an2}Your mother and I
had an arranged wedding.
{\an2}I didn’t know her either.
{\an2}She was pregnant with your sister,
and I didn’t even know her name.
{\an2}I called her "wife" during
those days back then.
{\an2}I may not know her name even now.
{\an2}I'm sorry, but this is exactly
what marriage is.
{\an2}-Serap.
-Who is Serap?
{\an2}My mother’s name is Serap, dad!
{\an2}Didn’t you tell me that you wanted
that doctor as a son-in-law?
{\an2}No, no way.
Heaven forbid.
{\an2}I don’t care about that doctor.
My vote is for this man.
{\an2}But this is your choice, of course.
{\an2}He's also handsome.
{\an2}I mean it, he looks good.
{\an2}He has a nice figure. I think so too.
My vote is for him also.
{\an2}But he wouldn’t want our girl, though.
{\an2}My girl, you need to pretty yourself up.
{\an2}You need to be charming.
{\an2}Well, if I were a woman...
{\an2}Dad, what are you doing?
{\an2}Come, my boy.
{\an2}She fell in love with me at hello, too.
{\an2}She just can’t admit it yet.
She needs time to process all of this.
{\an2}I wish I could spend some time with Elif.
{\an2}<font color="white">Be careful what you wish for.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">It can happen instantly.</font>
{\an2}My father is calling, be quiet.
{\an2}They called from our ranch.
{\an2}Wild Girl is missing.
{\an2}What? Wild Girl is missing?
{\an2}I was there two days ago.
{\an2}Listen, you're not responsible
for this, are you?
{\an2}Dad, she's a horse, a horse!
What would I do with Wild Girl?
{\an2}-What kind of son do you think I am?
<font color="white">-I'm calling the police now.</font>
{\an2}If you're responsible for it,
we are going to have a talk.
{\an2}Dad, please. I have already
a lot of responsibilities.
{\an2}Please don’t call the police.
I will take care of it.
{\an2}Wild Girl is my favorite horse,
she's my sweetheart.
{\an2}I also know a man who is the father
of the most skilled police captain
{\an2}in the country.
{\an2}I got this.
{\an2}I know what you're thinking.
{\an2}She's just not a horse.
She's my friend, my everything.
{\an2}She's an English thoroughbred.
Life will never be the same.
{\an2}I'm not the same either.
{\an2}Mr. Ferhat, may I have a moment
of your time?
{\an2}I can give you all the time I have left.
{\an2}We are devastated, as you can see.
{\an2}We would do anything for Wild Girl.
{\an2}This all belongs to us.
The ranch is just an excuse.
{\an2}When we find an available land,
we buy it right away.
{\an2}Gokhan usually deals
with those kind of transactions.
{\an2}By the way, let me introduce myself.
{\an2}I'm Ferhat, he CEO of LSI Corporate group.
{\an2}Isn’t that your father’s company?
{\an2}I used to work with my father too,
when I was a little girl,
{\an2}and then I grew up and got a real job.
{\an2}Now, I just pay him a visit
once in a while.
{\an2}Ms. Elif, have I done something
wrong to you?
{\an2}I know what you're trying to do.
{\an2}Don’t waste your time.
{\an2}What? What am I trying to do?
{\an2}Taking off those glasses and all.
{\an2}What is this about?
{\an2}Do you think you look prettier
when you take off those glasses?
{\an2}You look much more handsome
when I take off my glasses.
{\an2}I have myopia. It conceals the flaws.
{\an2}Let’s go back to work.
{\an2}Please! Relieve me from my misery already.
{\an2}What the hell?
{\an2}Did you hire anyone new
in the past three months?
{\an2}Yes, we hired Omer
as a stableman.
{\an2}He's an easy-going person.
He wears his heart on his sleeve.
{\an2}He's from our hometown.
We wouldn’t expect such a thing from him.
{\an2}Okay. Don't let him know,
{\an2}but provide all information about him
to my colleagues.
{\an2}Let’s investigate.
{\an2}There is this urgent matter
that we need to kiss each other.
{\an2}<font color="white">I used to work with my father too,</font>
<font color="white">when I was a little girl.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">And then I grew up</font>
<font color="white">and had a got job for myself.</font>
{\an2}She treated me
like I'm a spoiled child, Gokhan.
{\an2}I need to prove myself
to her immediately.
{\an2}She suspects of Omer.
{\an2}While they are messing around
{\an2}we are going to find the horse and prove
to her I'm better than her at her job--
{\an2}Did she know about Omer?
{\an2}How did she find out?
{\an2}Did Omer steal from her?
{\an2}How do you know?
{\an2}I was watching the security cameras.
I was about to erase the footage,
{\an2}-then you showed up.
-Why?
{\an2}I told them that footage was erased.
{\an2}Why?
{\an2}I don’t know, when we watch it,
{\an2}I thought you would’ve been
responsible
{\an2}for her disappearance.
{\an2}Cut this shit.
{\an2}We need to find that horse
before they do, Gokhan.
{\an2}Okay, Gokhan.
{\an2}That security guy knows what to do.
{\an2}After causing a malfunction
on Omer's car
{\an2}he will give him the keys of
company’s car. It has GPS.
{\an2}We will wait here,
and the moment the car
{\an2}arrives to its destination,
we will catch him in the act.
{\an2}How?
{\an2}It is like we are doing these
kind of things every day.
{\an2}-I just broke it, it won't function.
-Ferhat, Omer is coming.
{\an2}Hide.
{\an2}Look at him,
{\an2}he knows that he will get caught,
He's on the run.
{\an2}Hide behind the car,
we will wait there.
{\an2}So Ferhat,
{\an2}the car is working.
Didn’t you break it down?
{\an2}I took this from his car. I have no idea
how this car can be still functional.
{\an2}This is a battery cover!
{\an2}Did you just take the battery cover
to break his car down?
{\an2}I'm sorry, Mr. Gokhan.
Does it have any writing on it?
{\an2}Yes, it does. Read.
{\an2}"Battery cover."
{\an2}The car is lighter now. It goes faster.
{\an2}Wait for me, Wild Elif.
I'm on his trail.
{\an2}You go and investigate.
{\an2}We’ll see who will win.
Gamble accepted.
{\an2}It is not gamble,
we say challenge accepted.
{\an2}You don’t even know the right word for it.
We are doomed.
{\an2}What are you doing?
Are you crying?
{\an2}There is nothing to be afraid of.
{\an2}When we get off, we will have
a decent conversation with him.
{\an2}I will say that he's our friend,
assure him that we will cover this up.
{\an2}He will give the horse back,
we will say our goodbyes, that's all.
{\an2}I'm not upset because of that.
Look what I found.
{\an2}What is it doing here?
He has a gun.
{\an2}He had a gun. Now, we have it.
We have the upper hand.
{\an2}I'm kind of his kin.
He wouldn’t shoot me.
{\an2}But, I'm not his kin.
{\an2}Well, you need to save
your own skin, Gokhan.
{\an2}Stay behind me.
Try to stay calm.
{\an2}He may just shoot you
to intimidate me.
{\an2}Look for the exit!
Is there no exit?
{\an2}Any windows?
{\an2}There is no door!
{\an2}Do something!
{\an2}I'm stuck.
{\an2}Gokhan, I'm stuck like this.
{\an2}If he caught me in this position,
it wouldn’t be good for me.
{\an2}I'm so vulnerable right now
to fight back.
{\an2}Even erotic novel writers couldn’t
have thought something like this.
{\an2}Stop, be quiet.
He will hear us.
{\an2}Don’t be a smart-ass.
{\an2}Stop showing off.
{\an2}Are you showing off to me?
{\an2}Let me get through.
{\an2}I'm stuck too.
I can’t move.
{\an2}We are like flies that head-butt
the window while trying to get out.
{\an2}Wasn’t it obvious that you wouldn’t be
able to get through?
{\an2}-What did you do?
-I panicked.
{\an2}I'm stuck like this too, by the way.
{\an2}We literally gave him an opportunity.
{\an2}I could be his kin also
{\an2}so he wouldn’t shoot me either.
What do you say?
{\an2}So you're saying that yours is better
than mine, in other words.
{\an2}Gokhan, if we push it real hard,
we may be able to move it.
{\an2}Try with your back.
{\an2}On three.
{\an2}One...
{\an2}two...
{\an2}Fuck! I said, on three.
{\an2}I panicked.
{\an2}Three!
{\an2}Oh, now I get it.
{\an2}I didn’t leave you, I didn’t.
{\an2}I'm just warming up.
{\an2}We don’t know what is waiting
for us inside.
{\an2}I’d flee, if I wanted to.
Anyone would flee but me.
{\an2}I didn’t. Because I'm your friend.
{\an2}Calm down.
We are finishing this.
{\an2}I will go inside and talk to Omer,
and it’ll be over soon.
{\an2}Calm down.
{\an2}This place looks like those houses
featured in TV shows
{\an2}where all the murders and kidnappings
happen and then are solved.
{\an2}I’d flee, though, if I wanted to.
{\an2}Omer is not in there.
There is only one person. Come.
{\an2}You're so confident.
{\an2}What is going on?
{\an2}I'm just going to talk with him, man.
{\an2}Would you want me to break the door also?
{\an2}Look, he's scared of you,
and you're scared of him.
{\an2}I was just going to talk to him.
{\an2}What the fuck?
{\an2}-Ferhat!
-Omer, what's up?
{\an2}Did you pull a gun on him?
{\an2}And I assumed
that he was very happy to see us.
{\an2}Why did you steal the horse, Omer?
{\an2}You're like my kin.
Put the gun down.
{\an2}Give the horse back to me and get lost.
The police will be here soon.
{\an2}She will be here, I will prove myself
to her with the horse.
{\an2}Tell us! Where is the horse?
I won’t ask again.
{\an2}Talk to me, you jerk!
{\an2}Gokhan, what the fuck?
{\an2}I'm pumping adrenaline right now.
{\an2}Where is the horse, you douchebag?
Talk or I will shoot you!
{\an2}You don’t know how to handle this,
just give it a break.
{\an2}-Where is the horse, bro?
-She's here.
{\an2}Is this Wild Girl?
What have you done to her?
{\an2}Gokhan, they dyed my horse in purple.
She has spots.
{\an2}They turned an English thoroughbred
into a milk cow.
{\an2}This horse sounds like a cow.
{\an2}They messed up with her.
She thinks she is now a cow.
{\an2}Bro, why did you do something like this?
{\an2}Don’t get me wrong,
{\an2}but she was feeling so lonely
as a horse here.
{\an2}So we thought of camouflaging it.
{\an2}With some oil paint--
{\an2}The cops are here!
{\an2}Shoot me if you want,
but I'm running off.
{\an2}Where are you going?
Why would you chase him?
{\an2}Why would you chase him?
{\an2}What has gotten into you?
{\an2}Hands up! Hands up!
{\an2}We can explain.
It is not what it looks like.
{\an2}Mr. Ferhat.
{\an2}Is that a gun? Drop it!
{\an2}-Why did you throw it at me?
-I panicked, I just panicked!
{\an2}Captain.
{\an2}"Nuri plastic, made in China."
{\an2}The horse is in the stable.
They dyed it.
{\an2}What were you two doing
with the missing horse?
{\an2}-And what’s with the toy gun?
-What?
{\an2}That wasn’t a real gun?
{\an2}I threatened him
with a toy gun?
{\an2}I think my blood sugar just plummeted.
{\an2}I wonder if there is something to eat
in the car like cheese or bread.
{\an2}I also kicked him.
{\an2}I'm about to black out.
{\an2}Mr. Ferhat,
{\an2}I really hope you are not responsible
for this incident.
{\an2}Ms. Elif, she's just a horse.
{\an2}Sorry Ms. Elif, may I call you Elif?
{\an2}-No.
-Okay.
{\an2}Ms. Elif, she's my horse.
{\an2}The thief just ran away.
{\an2}Also why would I do that?
{\an2}We will find out.
{\an2}Take them.
{\an2}Go, go, go.
{\an2}Wait a second. Be gentle with her.
{\an2}She's shy, move.
{\an2}Here, my girl, here.
Calm down.
{\an2}I could have fled.
{\an2}A horse is like its master.
{\an2}She's just depressed.
{\an2}My beautiful, my Wild Girl.
{\an2}Ferhat’s most beloved,
this dye will come out.
{\an2}Calm down, girl.
{\an2}Did they make you sad?
{\an2}My precious.
My sweetheart. My Wild Girl.
{\an2}We are respected business people.
Please.
{\an2}Why would I steal my own horse?
{\an2}We were there to help you.
{\an2}Then why did you erase
the security footage?
{\an2}You were going to take the insurance
money by stealing the horse, right?
{\an2}Well, you never cease to surprise me!
{\an2}It is on me.
{\an2}How did that happen?
{\an2}Mister, your spit spread all over us.
{\an2}It got on me too.
Let us do our job.
{\an2}What are you doing here?
{\an2}You are everywhere.
{\an2}Officer, am I under arrest?
{\an2}He's beating me
while I'm in your care.
{\an2}He's right.
{\an2}Please, sir. What are you doing?
{\an2}I'm like his father.
They are both kind of my boys.
{\an2}My own father just said
I'm "kind of" his son.
{\an2}Shut up! You prick!
{\an2}I was going to say not to hit him,
just me. He's an important CEO
{\an2}You asshole!
{\an2}I didn’t feel it.
{\an2}He spit on my forehead.
{\an2}Man, how did you do that?
How did you spin it like that?
{\an2}-Did it hit you?
-Go inside, move.
{\an2}This is not the retirement
I had in mind.
{\an2}I was mowing the grass this morning.
Now, I'm at the police station.
{\an2}They caught the guy who threw
himself out of the window.
{\an2}They are still looking for Omer.
{\an2}He’ll be found soon.
{\an2}Just sign your statements
and you may leave.
{\an2}Hikmet, just wrap things up.
{\an2}It is getting late.
I'm leaving to go to my restaurant.
{\an2}Have a nice day.
{\an2}Be ready for cross-examination.
{\an2}There is no cross-examination.
{\an2}When were you going to tell me
there was a burglar in the house?
{\an2}-They just told me.
-Dad, it wasn’t important.
{\an2}Shut up, you prick!
{\an2}Man, you just hit the driver with it.
This is getting dangerous, stop it.
{\an2}Why can’t I do that?
{\an2}Maybe there is something wrong
with your teeth, Uncle Zeki.
{\an2}What is it to you?
{\an2}She caught the burglar,
saved the horse and both of you.
{\an2}We owe her a great debt of gratitude.
{\an2}Then let’s thank her together
while things are still hot.
{\an2}I know where Ms. Elif is.
{\an2}Let's go.
{\an2}She offers food to the people in need.
{\an2}She finds time to do that too?
{\an2}This is the child I have dreamt of.
{\an2}Dad, are we going inside?
{\an2}Go, Ferhat! Find out
if she's seeing someone.
{\an2}She can still be my daughter.
{\an2}Probably, I would like her much more
than I like you.
{\an2}Thanks, dad.
{\an2}Here is our favorite candidate.
I will be inside.
{\an2}Sister, wait.
{\an2}Ms. Elif.
{\an2}We couldn’t find a chance to thank you.
{\an2}If you can accept these...
{\an2}It is okay. That is my job.
{\an2}Also, I didn’t do it alone.
It was a team effort.
{\an2}Yes, we should be thanking all
at the police station.
{\an2}I will do that first thing
in the morning.
{\an2}I wanted to thank you first.
{\an2}Where should I put these?
{\an2}Let me take them.
{\an2}This is a wonderful thing to do.
{\an2}Can we help?
{\an2}Why not? Come on.
{\an2}You can serve them.
{\an2}This is a nice feeling, isn’t it?
{\an2}Doing good things without expecting
anything in return.
{\an2}My God, if you grant my wish,
I will sacrifice a camel for you.
{\an2}Thank you.
{\an2}Don’t get me wrong...
{\an2}but would you accept a donation?
{\an2}-Donation?
-Yes.
{\an2}You got it wrong. This is not
a charity organization.
{\an2}Why would you need an intermediary
to do some good anyway?
{\an2}-It wouldn’t be like this.
-I only meant...
{\an2}that this is a really good thing
to do for others.
{\an2}Do you want to do it too?
{\an2}God only knows all the opportunities
you have to do something good.
{\an2}Start with your own environment.
{\an2}<font color="white">Actually, this is the exact place</font>
<font color="white">where my story began.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">The thing I needed to understand</font>
<font color="white">was just right front of me.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">Did I understand it, though?</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">Sort of.</font>
{\an2}So I told myself that I needed
to start with my own environment.
{\an2}Yes, you see them right.
{\an2}I've got four water fountains for you.
{\an2}From now on, water is free,
courtesy of our company.
{\an2}I can see your enthusiasm.
No need for applause.
{\an2}Congratulations.
{\an2}You went to her restaurant once
and look what happened.
{\an2}How do you know?
Are you following me?
{\an2}Yes. You should know it by now.
{\an2}I’ve been doing it for like, 30 years.
{\an2}Let’s work hard for that bid first,
we talk about this later.
{\an2}We can take care of it.
It's almost finished.
{\an2}Let’s go to the police station
and thank them in person.
{\an2}I had a wreath made for them.
We are in debt.
{\an2}Let’s send it then.
Why are we going in person?
{\an2}Maybe I could see Elif.
{\an2}We are doomed.
{\an2}This is the place.
{\an2}He hasn’t done any good to anyone
his whole life,
{\an2}but he thinks he's an opinion leader.
{\an2}-What‘s with the wreath?
-Just take it.
{\an8}Good thing we came with a rental.
{\an8}It is full of scratches.
{\an8}I told you it would.
They will be pissed when we return it.
{\an2}Sirs, hello.
{\an2}May I have your attention fora minute?
{\an2}Here you go, Mr. Ferhat.
{\an2}We didn’t have a chance
to thank all of you properly yesterday.
{\an2}Please accept this wreath as a token
of our deepest apologies.
{\an2}Leave it outside.
{\an2}There is an empty area over there,
just leave it there.
{\an2}Excuse me, bro.
Hello, everybody.
{\an2}The doc is here.
{\an2}My man is here.
{\an2}The divine light of my eyes, welcome.
{\an2}I’ve missed you, my love.
{\an2}-I'm talking with my wife.
-Talk to her outside, don’t scare us.
{\an2}I thought you all must be hungry.
{\an2}If I invited you to a dinner,
{\an2}you wouldn’t come
so I'm here instead.
{\an2}Enjoy all.
{\an2}You didn’t have to bother.
{\an2}You're making us all embarrassed.
{\an2}Look, he even remembers
I don't like onions on mine.
{\an2}What is going on?
{\an2}It looks like he's besties
with all of them. What is he doing here?
{\an2}Is Ms. Elif here? We were supposed
to go for a bite.
{\an2}You were supposed to do what?
{\an2}-Boss, what’s up?
-Stay away!
{\an2}What are you doing here? Weren’t you
supposed to be in the hospital?
{\an2}It is my off day.
{\an2}Welcome.
{\an2}Do you guys know each other?
{\an2}-We are friends from high school.
-I'm his boss.
{\an2}Onay...
{\an2}I need to take care of something first.
Would you give me a couple of hours?
{\an2}Sure. No problem.
{\an2}Same place, right?
The one on the back alley.
{\an2}Okay, perfect. See you then.
{\an2}I'm leaving the rest of the wraps on here.
Enjoy, guys.
{\an2}-Ferhat, my dear.
-Leave already!
{\an2}Gokhan, honey.
{\an2}Onay, you prick.
{\an2}Come, I can offer you
some tea.
{\an2}I don’t drink tea, Ms. Elif.
{\an2}Because I'm starving.
I'm very hungry.
{\an2}I need to eat something as
soon as possible.
{\an2}I mean, if it’s okay for you--
{\an2}What is this?
{\an2}Sorry, Ms. Elif. There are lots of wraps,
{\an2}and I thought that it would be
a nice thing to feed him too.
{\an2}That’s so thoughtful of you.
{\an2}Okay, thank you. I'm eating this.
{\an2}Also, you made me upset.
Have fun.
{\an2}Ms. Elif.
{\an2}This wreath can be still useful.
{\an2}-Do you want some vegetables in it?
-No!
{\an2}I will totally eat it.
{\an2}-Where did we park the car?
-Right here.
{\an2}Right over there,
under the sign of no parking.
{\an2}-So, they towed it.
-Shit!
{\an2}I saw it, but you were speaking
at that moment,
{\an2}-and I didn't want to interrupt you.
-We were here for five minutes!
{\an2}-Why would they tow it?
-Because I called them.
{\an2}Hikmet, you really didn’t like us.
{\an2}Taxi!
{\an2}No need for a taxi. That parking lot
is right over there. It is close.
{\an2}Thank you, officer.
{\an2}It is not close, bro.
They will walk a lot.
{\an2}So much the better.
{\an2}He was rude to the doctor.
I'm pissed because of it.
{\an2}You did well.
{\an2}We've been walking for like, 40 minutes.
He did it on purpose.
{\an2}-I’ve got blisters on my feet.
-We should at least leave this wreath.
{\an2}Why are we still carrying it?
{\an2}I want to use the herbs in it.
{\an2}This was the first time
we thanked anyone for anything,
{\an2}and look how they treated us!
{\an2}You shouldn’t have made
that last move, Hikmet.
{\an2}Are you upset with something, bro?
{\an2}He said to put it the empty area.
{\an2}They all teamed up with that doc,
I'm telling you.
{\an2}They were trying to destroy you,
so to speak.
{\an2}No way!
The game is on now!
{\an2}Move! I’ll drive the car.
{\an2}Give me that white key.
{\an2}Give it to me!
{\an2}Elif and him are going out for lunch.
It would be beneath us.
{\an2}What?
{\an2}That doesn’t mean they are lovers.
{\an2}Maybe they are just friends.
{\an2}That doctor kissed you, kissed me.
He didn’t kiss her.
{\an2}Those officers are trying to hook her
up with that doctor with cheap theatrics.
{\an2}-Who knows, right?
-Smart ones know. Move!
{\an2}Who are you?
{\an2}Call that snitch of ours, Emre.
{\an2}We have a field work for him.
{\an2}He will go to that restaurant
where they are going to have a lunch.
{\an2}He will have a table next to them.
In secret.
{\an2}He will take notes about everything
that they talk about.
{\an2}We will find out soon enough.
{\an2}You don’t have any greys, damn.
Blacks and whites only.
{\an2}Mr. Gokhan.
Mr. Ferhat, what’s with the wreath?
{\an2}Is that a camouflage?
{\an2}Yes, Emre, it is a camouflage, Emre.
He's also just another prick.
{\an2}Mr. Gokhan, please don’t get mad.
{\an2}That show was for me?
{\an2}Are you showing off to me?
{\an2}Look up.
{\an2}I’ve coated that asphalt
that you drive on.
{\an2}Be a man!
{\an2}Emre, you have a job to do.
{\an2}Give me that flash drive.
I will work on our bid.
{\an2}Don’t let our blood spilled for nothing.
{\an2}Man, don’t say something like that.
You're scaring him.
{\an2}Find a table next to them.
{\an2}Takes notes about everything
they talk about.
{\an2}It may seem irrelevant to our work.
Don’t worry. They talk in codes.
{\an2}I can encode it, you can’t.
{\an2}Don’t worry. Go.
{\an2}Move!
{\an2}I see him everywhere.
{\an2}Efe Sultan.
{\an2}When I'm done with this,
I will deal with you also.
{\an2}I'm going to grab that project.
{\an2}<font color="white">Love the God</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">Admire the God</font>
{\an2}Tell me, what happened?
{\an2}<font color="white">Watch the mole</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">Admire the mole</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">Admire the mole</font>
{\an2}What happened?
{\an2}Something happened.
{\an2}I turned him down
without hurting his feelings.
{\an2}You turned a food engineer down
last year.
{\an2}You're definitely playing
hard to get.
{\an2}You have turned engineers
and doctors down. It is a cliché.
{\an2}What did you say to him?
{\an2}According to her,
he's good and handsome,
{\an2}he can have all the girls he wants.
{\an2}So?
{\an2}He's so handsome
{\an2}that if he puts his picture online,
he can get at least thousand likes.
{\an2}If I were a girl, I’d give it to you.
{\an2}Elif said that?
{\an2}No, I'm exaggerating it.
It is my thing.
{\an2}Ready?
Here comes the killing blow.
{\an2}She said to him
she in love with someone else.
{\an2}I knew it, I knew they are not lovers.
{\an2}Who is the man she loves?
Who is he?
{\an2}Of course, it is you.
But...
{\an2}to make sure...
{\an2}a little...
{\an2}bit of information...
{\an2}would be nice, though.
{\an2}She did, she did.
{\an2}She gave him my description
down to the last detail.
{\an2}That doc is a perfect guy already.
{\an2}There is no side of him
that you have to change.
{\an2}He's already decent.
So he couldn’t be your type.
{\an2}Are we still on the same topic?
{\an2}What’s wrong with it?
{\an2}People wouldn’t change, Elif.
{\an2}Don’t try to change men,
accept them for who they are.
{\an2}Listen, that habit of mine cost me
my marriage.
{\an2}Anyway.
What else did you say to him?
{\an2}I let him know that I have platonic
crush and he doesn’t even know
{\an2}that I have feelings for him
and I dropped the subject.
{\an2}That’s it?
Didn’t you tell him anything else?
{\an2}Wasn’t that more than enough?
I'm not her friend.
{\an2}I don’t even know
that she has feelings for me.
{\an2}It is done.
{\an2}Let me see, let me see if it’s true.
{\an2}I see a huge stick for you, man.
{\an2}-I think you will get a beating.
-Let me see.
{\an2}Is that a stick?
{\an2}It has curled edges.
{\an2}Exactly. It is a knotty wood.
{\an2}-That will be a hell of a beating.
-That’s Elif.
{\an2}The first letter of Elif.
She's my destiny.
{\an2}Gokhan, I think I have never
fallen in love before.
{\an2}It’s like, I have butterflies
n my stomach.
{\an2}I have found the woman of my life.
{\an2}I will have what I’ve wished for.
I think I have a clean heart.
{\an2}I think so, too. Very clean.
{\an2}Since you haven’t used that before,
it is so clean.
{\an2}Have you ever used your heart
all this time?
{\an2}And this had to be in the same time
with the bid. I'm going nuts!
{\an2}There are most important things
in life than work.
{\an2}We are doomed.
{\an2}Doomed, doomed.
{\an2}Maybe that platonic crush of yours
is that rich guy, right, Elif?
{\an2}What was his name? Mahmut?
{\an2}-Ferhat?
-I know his name, I was just testing you.
{\an2}I heard Hikmet was talking
behind him.
{\an2}Ferhat is a raw marble in his eyes.
{\an2}And did you like that comment?
He doesn’t even know
{\an2}that women in our family
have this Michelangelo virus.
{\an2}Elif could see the work of art inside
that raw marble.
{\an2}Sis, you're overreacting.
He's not that bad.
{\an2}He's not?
{\an2}Let’s try to look
at the bright side of things.
{\an2}My father is so close to being
the happiest man on earth because of him.
{\an2}I'm sorry, Captain Elif,
but our guys caught the horse thief.
{\an2}<font color="white">Take him to the interrogation room.</font>
{\an2}I will be there in half an hour.
Bring the complainants too.
{\an2}Do we always have to watch her
behind the windows, Ferhat?
{\an2}Any progress?
{\an2}Dad, why are you waving your hand?
She can’t see us.
{\an2}Why did you steal the horse?
{\an2}I needed it.
{\an2}-The horse?
-No, the money.
{\an2}You had everything you need!
{\an2}Who were you going to sell it to?
And why specifically Wild Girl?
{\an2}He wouldn’t say.
He wouldn’t say.
{\an2}Your relatives haven’t sued you yet.
{\an2}We haven’t? What is she saying?
We will sue him, officer.
{\an2}They told me that you have two children.
{\an2}One of them is getting a good education.
{\an2}-Did you tell her?
-Does he have kids?
{\an2}She knows her stuff.
{\an2}If I were Ferhat,
I would have no pity on you.
{\an2}You don’t deserve it.
{\an2}That’s more like it.
{\an2}That horse has no value as an animal.
{\an2}He told me that I could
steal any horse from their ranch.
{\an2}And I stole one of them.
{\an2}-Who told you that?
-A John Doe.
{\an2}Look at me!
{\an2}I swear I don’t know who he is.
{\an2}He didn’t tell me his real name.
{\an2}It is registered on my phone,
you can check it.
{\an2}He's starting to talk.
{\an2}We are on this, don’t worry.
{\an2}-I'll inform you of further developments.
-Thank you, our precious.
{\an2}I mean, our precious captain.
{\an2}You were amazing back in there.
We were impressed.
{\an2}What was there to impress you?
I wouldn’t know any other way.
{\an2}Goodness only brings goodness.
{\an2}Goodness only...
{\an2}brings goodness,
That's what I told myself.
{\an2}This is why we have gathered
right here today.
{\an2}<font color="white">Everything was so clear this time.</font>
<font color="white">Did I see it though?</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">Sort of.</font>
{\an2}So I'm doing you a favor
without expecting anything in return.
{\an2}Water is free,
I got this mountain just for you.
{\an2}It is fountain, not mountain. You don’t
even know the right word for it.
{\an2}I was thinking of buying a simple one,
{\an2}but then, when I thought about it,
I'm not the old Ferhat anymore.
{\an2}I'm a new and different person.
{\an2}And our people have this terrible habit
of drinking water from tap by mouth.
{\an2}I thought about it also
and took and extra precaution.
{\an2}MISTER FERHAT
MOUNTAIN
{\an2}And we would be laughing at those
who want to drink it from tap by mouth.
{\an2}I'm going to deal with it today, Gokhan.
{\an2}I will take her father’s blessing,
{\an2}and then invite her to dinner.
{\an2}Just relieve me of my duty first
so one of us can still go and work.
{\an2}I need you, I can’t do this without you.
{\an2}I'm shocked. Okay, then.
{\an2}Mr. Muzaffer. Good morning.
{\an2}Who are you again?
{\an2}You look familiar,
have we met before?
{\an2}We were here the other day
with Ferhat, remember?
{\an2}Oh, were you here with him?
{\an2}I didn’t notice you.
{\an2}Welcome, Ferhat.
{\an2}How are you, Ferhat?
What is it? You seem upset.
{\an2}Did you sleep well?
{\an2}Do you have a gas problem?
{\an2}How did you know?
I do.
{\an2}Well, well.
Come here, my boy, come.
{\an2}Sir, what are you doing?
{\an2}Please, don’t.
{\an2}Excuse me.
{\an2}I feel much better now.
{\an2}I’ve raised children before, you know.
{\an2}So what is it?
{\an2}Sir, I’d like to talk
a delicate matter with you.
{\an2}I see.
{\an2}Son...
{\an2}go grab some assorted nuts
for yourself,
{\an2}and eat them over there.
{\an2}We have something private
and delicate to discuss.
{\an2}Wait outside.
{\an2}Bring the change.
{\an2}It has become a habit for him lately.
{\an2}Damn you, Mr. Ferhat.
{\an2}<font color="white">What is troubling you?</font>
<font color="white">You can talk to me.</font>
{\an2}Tell me.
{\an2}Mr. Muzaffer...
{\an2}my trouble is as dangerous
as missing the last ferry.
{\an2}Have you ever suffered from love?
{\an2}So? Have you ever suffered from love?
{\an2}Have you ever passed
a kidney stone before, Ferhat!?
{\an2}I’ve passed three times!
{\an2}I thought I was dying on the third one.
I just sat and cried, you see?
{\an2}It was like, I'm about to die,
{\an2}but it didn’t let me die
{\an2}peacefully!
{\an2}What doesn’t kill me,
{\an2}it doesn’t make me stronger either.
That was my lesson.
{\an2}It makes you crawl!
{\an2}I lost half of my life in there.
{\an2}Think about it.
{\an2}There is this thing as big as a bead
{\an2}coming out from your thing,
while you're peeing.
{\an2}It makes you cry, my boy.
{\an2}I shouted like, “Shoot me,
shoot me so I can die and rest."
{\an2}Why are you telling me all this?
{\an2}What you got is not a real problem.
That is what I'm trying to tell you.
{\an2}-But, sir--
-Quiet.
{\an2}-Sir--
-Let me!
{\an2}-My intention--
-Don’t interrupt!
{\an2}-My intention--
-Listen!
{\an2}-Sir, my--
-Son!
{\an2}You're a rich man!
{\an2}Wouldn’t it be beneath you?
{\an2}Suffering from love and all, huh?
{\an2}Get your facts straight!
{\an2}Sir, my intentions are serious.
{\an2}-If you let me to talk--
-I won’t! I can’t!
{\an2}Why would I?
{\an2}You're like a mountain,
take a look at yourself.
{\an2}If she didn’t love you back,
it would be her loss.
{\an2}If she upsets you,
she will face my wrath!
{\an2}Sir, I think you're mad at me.
Please don’t get me wrong.
{\an2}I'm here because I wanted your blessing
to talk with your daughter, sir.
{\an2}Doing otherwise would be wrong.
{\an2}What daughter?
{\an2}I’d like to invite
{\an2}Ms. Elif to dinner.
{\an2}I wanted to take your blessing first
to talk with your daughter, sir.
{\an2}Is it a wrong thing to do?
{\an2}I will be right back.
{\an2}My God...
{\an2}thank you for granting my wish.
{\an2}He's not a religious person,
what is he doing?
{\an2}Serap, good morning.
{\an2}Where is Betul?
She's not answering.
{\an2}Today is my day with the kids.
{\an2}Welcome. But didn’t Muzaffer tell you
not to come here again?
{\an2}Don’t make him mad, please.
{\an2}Mom, let me.
{\an2}Weren’t you told that you were not
to come here again, boy?
{\an2}Mom? Wait, who is this gentleman?
{\an2}No need to know me.
Why are you here?
{\an2}Sir, this is a family matter.
Don’t get involved please.
{\an2}Let's say I'm kind of part
of this family.
{\an2}And it concerns me from now on.
Okay?
{\an2}Really!
{\an2}How did you do this to me?
{\an2}I mean, If I knew, I’d bring some gifts
for both of you.
{\an2}Anyway, you should also know
that today is my day with the kids, sir.
{\an2}It's my legal right, but she doesn’t give
them to me on time deliberately.
{\an2}I'm the victim here.
{\an2}This seems to be a family matter.
Sorry, sir, I didn’t know.
{\an2}So what, my boy?
They woke up late.
{\an2}So what, huh? So what?
{\an2}Sir, please don’t interfere.
We talked about this minutes ago.
{\an2}Don’t point that finger at me,
and get rid of that bag.
{\an2}We have family elders here,
don’t bully me in front of them.
{\an2}Ferhat, let it go, my boy.
Let it go.
{\an2}Leave it to me, dad!
{\an2}He called me dad.
{\an2}-Dad? Damn.
-Come here.
{\an2}Dad, I'm taking him outside
for two minutes.
{\an2}-But sir, if you let me talk--
-Quiet, move.
{\an2}But sir, I'm asking you, please.
{\an2}I will beat you
{\an2}with a belt from a distance.
{\an2}Excuse me, sir, would you mind
if I ask for a spare ticket to take a bus?
{\an2}He does.
{\an2}I'm not this kind of person.
{\an2}I don’t deserve to be a father.
{\an2}I wish Betul happiness.
{\an2}Wait, son. You got it wrong.
{\an2}Let that prick go.
{\an2}He barely pays us 300 liras of alimony
per month.
{\an2}We have the smallest amount
of alimony in the neighborhood.
{\an2}The kid is wasted.
{\an2}Are you okay, son?
{\an2}Hey, bro! We are not dead yet.
Where are you going?
{\an2}Exactly, we are not dead yet.
{\an2}Hit us more.
{\an2}Don’t leave us hanging.
Finish us.
{\an2}We would be so upset.
{\an2}Ferhat that coffee reading
came true, you see?
{\an2}It wasn’t a knotty wood, though.
{\an2}Because this guy is short,
it was an image of this guy.
{\an2}Gokhan, I think you hit your head
pretty hard, go wait in the car.
{\an2}You didn’t think that
{\an2}he could move like that, did you?
{\an2}You could’ve asked me, though.
He's a boxer.
{\an2}Where did he hit you?
{\an2}Here. And here.
{\an2}You're good at getting a beating.
{\an2}Thank you, Mr. Muzaffer.
You're so kind.
{\an2}You're a traditional guy,
so you convinced me.
{\an2}You have my permission.
You can have dinner with Elif.
{\an2}But only once. Okay?
{\an2}When will you meet?
{\an2}Let me talk to Elif first.
She doesn’t know.
{\an2}You haven’t talked to Elif yet. Oh.
{\an2}I know my daughter.
It won't work. It will be hard for you.
{\an2}-Really.
-Anyway, we will see.
{\an2}So you need to conquer
the castle from the inside.
{\an2}We will work together.
Don’t worry.
{\an2}I have great plans.
{\an2}What are you doing tonight?
{\an2}I told you you'd get roughed up
in this neighborhood. You didn't listen.
{\an2}Nice, nice.
{\an2}Love is in the air.
{\an2}What kind of talk is this, Muzaffer?
In front of the kid.
{\an2}You shouldn’t say something like that.
{\an2}Why did you take it personally?
It has nothing to do with you, wife.
{\an2}Is this supposed to be an apology?
{\an2}So that love you smell in the air
belongs to someone else?
{\an2}It has nothing to do with me either.
{\an2}Don’t smear me.
{\an2}Am I the one smelling love in the air?
{\an2}Wife, give it a break.
For God’s sake.
{\an2}It is not about us.
{\an2}What was I saying?
I was saying something.
{\an2}What did I say? I said something.
{\an2}I said surprises,
{\an2}little surprises are really important
in life.
{\an2}In fact, those little surprises--
{\an2}I hope he gets better.
{\an2}It is sad that people have
problems this late at night.
{\an2}Maybe someone is dead or barely alive.
Who knows?
{\an2}Please, go to bed.
{\an2}Please!
{\an2}That ambulance is coming this way.
{\an2}I hope it is not here for a friend.
{\an2}It is right here.
{\an2}Do you see, Muzaffer?
Being a good neighbor is really hard.
{\an2}We live in the same street, and yet
we don’t know anything about each other.
{\an2}I was saying something.
I had started with "surprise."
{\an2}You blew it.
{\an2}That ambulance just stopped in front
of our apartment.
{\an2}Neighbor, who is it here for?
For Riza?
{\an2}Why would it be for me?
{\an2}Heaven forbid!
{\an2}Riza, after your wife passed away,
they told us
{\an2}you wouldn’t also live that long.
That’s why I thought it had come for you.
{\an2}It is a rumor.
I didn’t like her that much.
{\an2}Also, I did some calculations.
{\an2}I can live another ten years
with my pension.
{\an2}Otherwise, it won’t cover my expenses,
after all those salary cuts.
{\an2}He has no intention to die.
He would bury us first.
{\an2}It is here for number six.
{\an2}What?
{\an2}Number six?
{\an2}We are the number six.
{\an2}Good evening. We heard that a patient
is losing blood.
{\an2}What patient?
You're on the wrong address.
{\an2}I think he's in the back room.
Let us through.
{\an2}Son, wait a second.
Who is losing blood?
{\an2}Someone is losing blood in my own house
and I don’t know anything about it?
{\an2}Let’s see, why is he losing blood?
{\an2}Let me ask.
{\an2}Which back room--
{\an2}Perfumed, handsome boy.
{\an2}What are you doing here?
{\an2}-Ferhat, what are you doing?
-How are you?
{\an2}I had this little surprise for you.
{\an2}Through my research, I found out
you really love yellow tulips.
{\an2}I was going to pour them down
from the balcony,
{\an2}but the molding broke.
I got cuts on my hands and feet.
{\an2}God literally damned me.
I was about to die.
{\an2}But son, why did you call
for an ambulance?
{\an2}You're a young man. You could take
a little amount of blood loss.
{\an2}You wouldn’t die. Now,
we'll be the talk of this area.
{\an2}How are we going to explain this?
Muzaffer?
{\an2}Sir, I was going to shout,
but you’d mistake me for a thief
{\an2}and get scared.
The ambulance was a clear solution.
{\an2}So, Ms. Elif?
Do you like them?
{\an2}-I don’t like yellow tulips.
-You don’t?
{\an2}Who was the one who likes
yellow tulips?
{\an2}Someone did.
{\an2}My shop is filled with yellow tulips.
{\an2}Wife?
{\an2}I love them.
{\an2}We were close
You were close!
{\an2}You were close!
{\an2}You brought my wife’s
favorite flowers.
{\an2}If I didn’t know you had good intentions,
I’d be the one to make you bleed.
{\an2}These people would be here
because of that. Anyway, they are here.
{\an2}-Guys, you can take him.
-Wait.
{\an2}Poor guy, what has gotten into you?
{\an2}He's trying to thank us.
{\an2}My name is Muzaffer.
{\an2}I will be victorious.
{\an2}I will turn the tide.
{\an2}What are you saying, husband?
{\an2}I'm saying that we are so rude.
{\an2}He got injured in our house.
{\an2}Are we going to watch him like this,
from this balcony?
{\an2}No, I'm going to bed.
{\an2}I'm going to wash the dishes.
{\an2}No!
{\an2}You're coming with me!
{\an2}Now!
{\an2}Slowly. Real slow.
{\an2}It is over, go away.
{\an2}-Is that it?
-Yes.
{\an2}Did you send me that text message saying,
“I'm dying, save me” only for this.
{\an2}Forget about me.
{\an2}You called for an ambulance
only for this?
{\an2}This is the right hospital, right?
{\an2}Go, go!
{\an2}I'm a little bit obsessed
with this issue, I guess.
{\an2}I see him everywhere.
{\an2}Girl, I just saw your father running
after 30 years.
{\an2}Something’s happening to him.
{\an2}Mom?
{\an2}Onay works here,
I don’t want to see him.
{\an2}You go, I will wait here.
{\an2}Elif!
{\an2}Sorry.
{\an2}You're back.
{\an2}I'm sure you two have things
to talk about.
{\an2}I should go inside.
{\an2}Muzaffer, they are here. Here!
{\an2}I know, wife. I saw them,
but couldn’t slow down.
{\an2}I ran too fast. I will run back.
Wait for me.
{\an2}-What happened to you, are you okay?
-I'm fine, thanks.
{\an2}It is my heart.
{\an2}Let me catch my breath, it’ll pass.
{\an2}Mr. Muzaffer, welcome.
You didn’t have to--
{\an2}My heart!
{\an2}That sounded like a hiccup.
Right?
{\an2}Muzaffer, what is going on?
Are you okay?
{\an2}Doctor! Help me!
{\an2}Don’t panic. Let me.
{\an2}I’ve taken first aid courses all year.
{\an2}They all were for today, I guess.
{\an2}No need to waste time.
{\an2}One, and two, and three.
{\an2}Mr. Muzaffer, you're not responding
to the treatment.
{\an2}One, and two, and three.
{\an2}Thank you.
{\an2}Ferhat, you just saved my life.
{\an2}Don’t say that, sir.
Anyone would’ve done the same thing.
{\an2}No one would have done this, Ferhat.
{\an2}They would’ve said,
“We are already in a hospital,
{\an2}it is not necessary to save him.”
{\an2}Wife, get me some water.
{\an2}Right away, husband. Right away.
Thank you, God.
{\an2}Where is the doctor? Doctor!
{\an2}Ferhat, what was that, my son?
{\an2}You owe me an explanation.
Why didn’t you call the doctor?
{\an2}-Sir, I know how to do a basic CPR.
-But I didn’t know that.
{\an2}Look around you, my son.
We are in the hospital.
{\an2}No need for heroism.
{\an2}When I said I was feeling ill,
you should've called the doctor.
{\an2}The doctor would check me,
give me a serum
{\an2}and that would be the end of it.
{\an2}But I thought it was real.
I didn’t understand you were faking it.
{\an2}I was going to tell the story later,
{\an2}say that I would’ve been dead,
if I hadn’t come visit Ferhat.
{\an2}It was fate that I'm still alive,
thanks to Ferhat.
{\an2}And we were going to sell this story
perfectly.
{\an2}That was an awesome plan.
{\an2}Who are you?
{\an2}You look familiar,
have we met before?
{\an2}Go ahead, Muzaffer.
{\an2}-Drink it.
-Thanks.
{\an2}He can’t save me to his memory drive,
I guess.
{\an2}He acts like I'm the wrong number.
{\an2}Thank you, wife.
{\an2}-Please, bring me another one.
-Sure.
{\an2}Put some ice in it.
{\an2}Where is the doctor?
{\an2}What kind of first aid was that?
You couldn’t even find my pulse.
{\an2}Why did you press down that hard
on a beating heart?
{\an2}It could've malfunctioned,
and then I'd literally die.
{\an2}I'm already a rotten egg.
{\an2}What just happened?
{\an2}-Sir, I got panicked--
-Get off!
{\an2}No one has ever kissed me but my wife.
{\an2}What luck. You're the second
person now.
{\an2}There is a huge age difference between us,
you could’ve shown some respect.
{\an2}I was about to die,
and he was groping me, kissing me.
{\an2}I saw it.
{\an2}It was a CPR, sir, not groping.
I'm sorry.
{\an2}Here, Muzaffer. It has ice in it.
{\an2}Thank you, wife.
{\an2}We owe you our thanks.
{\an2}You can ask me anything.
{\an2}Don’t be shy.
{\an2}Yes. There was that thing about a dinner.
{\an2}I don’t know if this is the right time
for it, though.
{\an2}Of course, my son.
Don’t mention it.
{\an2}Bring your parents to our home
for dinner tomorrow evening.
{\an2}Sure. This is exactly
what he meant.
{\an2}Do you think they need that?
{\an2}Wife, you always put the cart
before the horse.
{\an2}How could I compete with you? Never.
{\an2}Let me through, I'm a doctor!
{\an2}Stop! Ferhat kissed me already!
Is this your turn now?
{\an2}Leave me alone!
{\an2}-Ferhat?
-Ferhat?
{\an2}Yes, my girl.
He knew how to do CPR.
{\an2}He saved you father’s life.
{\an2}-Ferhat!
-Ferhat!
{\an2}-Are you okay?
-No.
{\an2}Look, look. He's limping.
{\an2}Don’t fake it, don’t!
{\an2}Elif, don’t believe him.
It was just a splinter.
{\an2}He's obsessed with me.
He must be jealous.
{\an2}Why would the doctor
be jealous of you?
{\an2}While he was flirting with you here,
I was up there, kissing your father.
{\an2}I mean, saving his life.
Of course, he's jealous.
{\an2}Here comes the glasses again.
{\an2}I think this is some sort of intimidation.
{\an2}Ferhat, I know what you're trying to do.
{\an2}Give me a chance.
{\an2}You’ve done so many things for me.
{\an2}-At least, I can take you to din--
-I haven’t done those things for you.
{\an2}It is my job.
{\an2}Have you ever thought about it?
{\an2}Do you think all this is
just a coincidence?
{\an2}My horse got stolen,
my house got robbed.
{\an2}This has all happened to bring
us together.
{\an2}You see?
{\an2}If he hadn't stolen
specifically Wild Girl,
{\an2}no one would've done anything about it
before this important bid.
{\an2}Important bid?
{\an2}It is tomorrow. We’ve been working
for three months to be ready for it.
{\an2}Why didn’t you tell me this before?
{\an2}What kind of laughter is that?
{\an2}Of course, it is not a coincidence.
{\an2}Come here, I'm not done yet.
{\an2}Dinner?
{\an2}What happened?
{\an2}Look, she just ran away.
{\an2}Good, I'm feeling good right now.
{\an2}Every bad has its worse.
{\an2}Prick.
{\an2}It will happen soon, Gokhan.
{\an2}I kissed her father,
I will kiss her soon.
{\an2}Did you kiss him deliberately?
{\an2}Yes.
{\an2}Everything was so clear in this plan.
I'm so pissed about that tulip thing.
{\an2}And I should've called the doctor.
Why am I such an idiot?
{\an2}You're in deeper trouble
than you think you are.
{\an2}-It is about to become an organized crime.
-Sure, sure.
{\an2}The others collaborated and got away.
{\an2}-Do you have something to say?
-I'm not saying anything.
{\an2}John Doe.
{\an2}God damn you.
{\an2}How can I help, captain?
{\an2}What did they ask you to steal
from Ferhat’s house?
{\an2}Let me explain, captain.
{\an2}They said there was this flash drive
with crucial information in it.
{\an2}I looked for it.
{\an2}They also said I needed to make a mess
to make it look like a basic robbery.
{\an2}I couldn’t find the flash drive.
So I was going to take the TV.
{\an2}Then you showed up.
{\an2}I'm carrying it with me all the time.
Here is our proposal.
{\an2}They were looking for this.
{\an2}In the house and in the ranch.
{\an2}Omer was looking for the flash drive also.
{\an2}He also made it look like a basic robbery
by stealing the horse.
{\an2}According to them, they couldn’t find it
in the office either--
{\an2}Did they check the office too?
{\an2}They couldn’t be here,
only I have the keys.
{\an2}And Emre has it.
{\an2}-Emre doesn’t have it, we took it.
-Sorry.
{\an2}-Only I have it.
-Right.
{\an2}So bro, do you know
what that means?
{\an2}It happened bro, it finally happened.
High five!
{\an2}Thank you, God.
I'm so happy right now.
{\an2}We finally did it.
{\an2}Guys, are you okay?
{\an2}This company has been here
for 50 years.
{\an2}My grandfather,
and my father were in charge.
{\an2}-But did any of them achieve such a thing?
-No!
{\an2}But this is our second year,
things are getting exciting.
{\an2}We’ve brought this company to this point
where they couldn’t in the past.
{\an2}And <font color="white">Game of Thrones </font>has begun.
{\an2}And this is the best part
that we’ve been ignoring.
{\an2}Now, it will be more much fun.
They see us as their equals.
{\an2}We are in the same league now,
Efe Sultan.
{\an2}I knew this day will come eventually.
{\an2}Attack me!
{\an2}Attack me with your full power.
{\an2}Guys, I don’t want to interrupt your
moment of joy,
{\an2}but your classified documents
were about to get stolen.
{\an2}Just like you said.
{\an2}They were about to.
{\an2}But it didn’t happen.
{\an2}Thanks to you.
{\an2}I guess I'm in a greater debt to you.
{\an2}Yes, this time you owe me big time.
{\an2}I was ahead of myself.
I saved a big company.
{\an2}Move, move.
{\an2}It is just a dinner.
{\an2}Move, dork. Move.
{\an2}I won’t become hopeful.
{\an2}If you want to reject me,
do that on that dinner.
{\an2}You turned down the doctor over a dinner.
Do the same to me, if you want.
{\an2}How do you know that I turned down
the doctor over dinner?
{\an2}I know that I shouldn’t say anything,
{\an2}but I have to, Ferhat.
{\an2}-Betul told me.
-My sister?
{\an2}-Her sister?
-My sweetie.
{\an2}What kind of nonsense is this?
She doesn’t even know you.
{\an2}Well?
{\an2}That’s what you think.
{\an2}We’ve been keeping a low profile
relationship since the day we met.
{\an2}We are making love like crazy, guys.
{\an2}Uludag is our witness.
{\an2}My love doesn’t keep anything
from me.
{\an2}She was going to tell you this...
{\an2}in person...
{\an2}but I couldn’t wait her to tell you.
{\an2}You don’t expect me to believe this,
do you?
{\an2}The doctor is your friend,
did he tell you that?
{\an2}The doctor is our friend.
He could’ve told us.
{\an2}Why didn’t you think that?
Moron.
{\an2}Why would I lie to you?
{\an2}If you don’t believe me,
call your sister and ask.
{\an2}Why did you do this?
Why did you tell her?
{\an2}Man, did you really seduce
her sister?
{\an2}Yes, what’s the big deal?
Look, we are brothers-in-law now.
{\an2}When I realized you're serious with her,
I needed to protect you, brother-in-law.
{\an2}Crazy dude!
{\an2}Stop with this!
{\an2}When you dump her sister,
she won't be with me even if she wants to.
{\an2}Brother-in-law, why would I dump
your sister-in-law?
{\an2}She's like Seda Sayan,
she's so blunt.
{\an2}She also has two kids.
She left all of those
{\an2}pregnancy, postnatal,
new born baby issues behind.
{\an2}We won’t be dealing with that.
{\an2}She's also beautiful.
It was a package deal.
{\an2}I won’t let that beating I had
from her ex go to waste.
{\an2}No way. That Muzaffer will memorize
{\an2}my name along with my surname!
{\an2}He will know me when he sees me.
{\an2}Is this your ambition?
{\an2}I wouldn’t be surprised
if I saw anything else in this life.
{\an2}-Saturday, eight o’clock.
-What?
{\an2}Dinner.
{\an2}I barely convinced her
for this weekend.
{\an2}Pick her up at our house
at 8 p.m. on Saturday.
{\an2}Don’t come into the house.
Just pick her up from the door.
{\an2}I’ve done my part.
It is your turn now.
{\an2}You shouldn’t talk big, Ferhat.
{\an2}Quiet, you big pumpkin.
{\an2}We also will have a conversation.
Your time will come.
{\an2}I will show you that Uludag.
{\an2}What will you show me
at Uludag?
{\an2}Telfer, Telfer.
{\an2}Brother-in-law,
why did you cover that Emre thing
{\an2}in front of my sister-in-law?
{\an2}I will take care of Emre myself.
{\an2}He was our most trusted guy.
{\an2}Traitor.
{\an2}Call him.
{\an2}<font color="white">If you're still stubborn,</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">one single incident would be enough</font>
<font color="white">to make you understand it.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">When you look back,</font>
<font color="white">you’ll realize that you deserved it.</font>
{\an2}I'm here, Mr. Ferhat.
{\an2}I came rushing from my home.
Sorry, my shirt is a little bit messy.
{\an2}I'm sorry.
{\an2}Get the fuck outta here.
{\an2}Mr. Gokhan, what are you doing?
{\an2}Sorry. I got angry.
{\an2}Then you should express your feelings.
{\an2}Fuck you, you prick!
{\an2}Who do you think you are?
We know everything.
{\an2}Mr. Ferhat, have I done
something wrong?
{\an2}Cut it, we know everything.
{\an2}John Doe, our ranch,
{\an2}robbery in our house,
our office searched.
{\an2}But they couldn’t find it.
{\an2}The police was just here.
{\an2}Your people talked.
Cut it out.
{\an2}Emre...
{\an2}is there anything
you want to tell me?
{\an2}There is.
{\an2}Never mind, that’s it then.
{\an2}There is no such a thing
that we will succeed every time.
{\an2}-Things can happen.
-Why are you so relaxed, brazen?
{\an2}Shut up!
{\an2}Is there anyone in this company
who wouldn’t betray you?
{\an2}Except Gokhan.
{\an2}We know Gokhan.
{\an2}You should’ve taken the deal
that Efe Sultan offered you.
{\an2}You have potential.
You would be useful.
{\an2}But now you will be a waste
while working for him.
{\an2}I didn’t accept it, of course.
{\an2}This is our company.
{\an2}He looks so shocked.
{\an2}The son of Mr. Zeki had no idea.
{\an2}-My name is Ferhat!
-Look, he's so angry, you see?
{\an2}Whenever you come here,
you think of your father, obviously.
{\an2}That's why you put these pictures
everywhere, right?
{\an2}You don’t want to be remembered
as the son of Mr. Zeki
{\an2}but Mr. Ferhat, right?
{\an2}We are alike.
{\an2}Turn around.
{\an2}That picture of Efe Sultan.
{\an2}That wasn’t for you.
{\an2}It is there for me.
{\an2}But you got it wrong as well.
{\an2}While you're working,
you have your back against it,
{\an2}but I have to stare it in the face,
{\an2}the picture of my father.
{\an2}Do you still think
that you know everything?
{\an2}Does Efe Sultan have a son?
{\an2}But you're right.
{\an2}Since we are not as popular as you are,
{\an2}you didn’t see a single photograph
of me and my father together.
{\an2}I used to be pissed at my father
when I was a kid.
{\an2}I thought he was ashamed of me,
{\an2}but it looks like he's a man of vision.
{\an2}Can you even compete with a man
who makes you pay a salary
{\an2}to his own son for years?
{\an2}What kind of person are you?
{\an2}That was nice.
{\an2}Okay. Don’t fire me.
I will quit.
{\an2}You can keep my compensation
as your spending money.
{\an2}My gift to you, son of Mr. Zeki.
Grow the hell up!
{\an2}It is not even fun.
{\an2}Later.
{\an2}He's just going freely.
{\an2}Do we call the police?
He just confessed.
{\an2}No. Don’t let him see Elif.
{\an2}We made him listen to her date.
He texted us everything.
{\an2}If he bumps into Elif,
he could do anything.
{\an2}It is so beyond us, Gokhan.
{\an2}<font color="white">Being someone else is something</font>
<font color="white">that we all dream of.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">Most of us will face the truth</font>
<font color="white">that we will never be that someone</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">we want to be.</font>
<font color="white">Like myself.</font>
{\an2}<font color="white">And this was one of the most</font>
<font color="white">beautiful things I’ve ever had.</font>
{\an8}TWO DAYS LATER
{\an2}Ferhat, I can’t take it anymore.
He will bring the whole house down on us.
{\an2}Everyone can do it,
why can’t I do it?
{\an2}I messed it up.
{\an2}It looks like you didn’t bid
on that project.
{\an2}-Efe Sultan got it?
-No, I didn’t.
{\an2}I think I messed it up, dad.
{\an2}My methods didn’t work.
{\an2}Since your retirement
is not really going peacefully,
{\an2}you should come back
to the company.
{\an2}For a while.
{\an2}I have a lot to learn from you.
{\an2}Maybe working old-style
is much more effective.
{\an2}Pardon?
{\an2}Old-style. Maybe.
{\an2}Go and call for a plumber, please.
{\an2}This is such a hard thing to do!
{\an2}I’ll take that as a yes, then.
{\an2}Any update on Elif?
{\an8}7.58 PM
SATURDAY
{\an2}-What happened?
-Is the dinner cancelled?
{\an2}No, I'm on my way.
{\an2}My girl, don’t be like this.
{\an2}I have much more make up on my face
than yours. Why aren’t you ready ?
{\an2}Why did you put foundation, Muzaffer?
{\an2}Mom, he also applied some mascara
on his eyelashes and moustache.
{\an2}It is a mascara for men.
{\an2}I thought we could have a family photo
and post it on Facebook.
{\an2}Look at her, she's looks like
she's going for a picnic.
{\an2}Sister, why are you dressed up?
{\an2}I'm just meeting with some friends.
{\an2}Maybe you should wear something else.
{\an2}Sister, it is just a dinner.
{\an2}I'm leaving.
{\an2}I will be back in a couple of hours.
I won’t be late.
{\an2}You can be late.
{\an2}It is clear to me now
that two children are not enough.
{\an2}If you have five, six children,
one might not marry a rich guy,
{\an2}then any of the others will.
{\an2}But I have limited opportunities.
{\an2}Good evening, Elif.
Your prince charming is here.
{\an2}I'm not a prince, though.
I'm just charming with a horse.
{\an2}But it counts.
{\an2}Yes, it does! This is good!
{\an2}You charming guy!
{\an2}You're embarrassing us.
{\an2}Horses are a part of our culture.
Why would you feel embarrassed?
{\an2}So...
{\an2}horse, beloved, Ferhat.
{\an2}Also, Wild Girl wanted to thank you.
I couldn’t leave her behind.
{\an2}Jump on and let's get this night started.
{\an2}Excuse me? Me, ride a horse?
{\an2}No way.
{\an2}Come on, just jump on.
The rest will come.
{\an2}It feels like flying, they say.
{\an2}Ferhat, I said no.
{\an2}There is no way I ride that horse.
{\an2}We will see. Come.
{\an2}You're so stubborn!
{\an2}What would you lose
if you rode with me?
{\an2}Driver, take the right!
{\an2}Choose where you want to sit.
Where should we sit?
{\an2}This restaurant is empty.
There is no one here.
{\an2}I've reserved the whole restaurant
just for us.
{\an2}I thought you might not want
to get disturbed by other people.
{\an2}You can sit anywhere.
{\an2}Why do you insist on acting like that?
You're uncouth.
{\an2}This is the Ferhat I'm talking about.
{\an2}He could reserve restaurants
for the night.
{\an2}He could buy staff to serve him.
{\an2}He would want people around him.
{\an2}I don’t know, you shouldn’t let your
money defining--
{\an2}Good evening, ma'am.
{\an2}You're his girlfriend, I suppose?
{\an2}I hope we didn’t open a restaurant
in a wrong place.
{\an2}I'm not his girlfriend,
I'm here just to eat.
{\an2}I'm sorry, our uncouth here closed
your restaurant for tonight.
{\an2}What?
{\an2}Closed?
We haven’t had the opening yet.
{\an2}It will be open in two weeks.
{\an2}We were told this was for a good cause.
We couldn’t deny it.
{\an2}What are you doing?
{\an2}My job, mademoiselle.
{\an2}Terrace is available.
{\an2}Thank you, sir.
{\an2}May I have a menu?
{\an2}Menu?
{\an2}It is so boring.
It has long writings on it.
{\an2}We have one with the pictures.
I’ll bring the chef.
{\an2}Ma'am.
{\an2}Mr. Ferhat will have the same thing
you order.
{\an2}Your wish is my command.
{\an2}So, you're good at cooking then?
{\an2}My father is also a chef.
I know my stuff.
{\an2}Is this your father’s work?
No, this is my real job, ma'am.
{\an2}It is not the same thing
as playing in your father’s workplace.
{\an2}I'm so happy right now.
{\an2}So I will watch you
while you prepare the food.
{\an2}Do your best, chef.
{\an2}I will be watching you.
{\an2}What are you doing, ma'am?
{\an2}I'm taking these outside.
{\an2}Please, leave them to the waiter.
{\an2}Sister, what are you doing?
{\an2}What are you doing,
are you trying to get me fired?
{\an2}Just leave it!
{\an2}Leave it, leave, leave.
{\an2}Welcome.
{\an2}It is a tradition
in the restaurant, I guess.
{\an2}I'm not a fan of it either,
but the boss makes me do it.
{\an2}I’ve kissed her three times already
before the dinner.
{\an2}Let’s hope for the best.
{\an2}For salads, Elif, we have gavur dagi,
shepherd’s salad, seasonal salad, caesar.
{\an2}No, thanks. Elif?
{\an2}How about some lahmacun, lentil cheese,
thin bread, or meatballs as starters?
{\an2}-Or Tatarian minced meat?
-No, thank you.
{\an2}As appetizers, we have saksuka, artichoke,
Russian salad, potato salad and haydari.
{\an2}Please, we don’t want anything else.
{\an2}Kunefe for dessert?
I'd be ready by the end of your meal.
{\an2}We don’t want anything else!
Got it?
{\an2}Why are you yelling at me?
The boss told me to ask, and I asked.
{\an2}I'm going to get Ferhat then.
{\an2}I just totally ripped my shirt off.
This wasn’t my intention.
{\an2}I was going to turn that jacket inside out
and put it on this shirt.
{\an2}It was set.
{\an2}Literally, I'm holding a white flag.
{\an2}Also, I have six-pack like cold drinks.
{\an2}Now.
{\an2}I wish you hadn’t done that.
We were having so much fun.
{\an2}What?
{\an2}Fireworks.
{\an2}What has that got to do with me?
{\an2}Is that a name?
Isn’t that the letter of “E”
{\an2}This is so rude.
{\an2}What has that got to do with me?
{\an2}Here comes the “L.”
{\an2}Is this a coincidence now?
{\an2}There is no such a thing as coincidence.
{\an2}“Elite palm reading?"
{\an2}What the hell?
{\an2}So all that glitters isn’t gold, is it?
{\an2}I'm sorry, it just happened
as you joined me. So, I was wrong.
{\an2}Don’t worry about it,
but get used to it.
{\an2}I'm not that spoiled child
you think I am, Elif.
{\an2}I'm a little of everything.
{\an2}And you're very judgmental.
{\an2}I think so, yes.
{\an2}So do you like it?
{\an2}Our chef is very famous.
He adds love and passion
{\an2}to his food instead of salt.
{\an2}It is much more healthy this way.
{\an2}-But you insist on adding salt--
-Love? In three days?
{\an2}Right, I'm such an idiot!
{\an2}Can you love someone in three days?
{\an2}Love should be like mine.
{\an2}At first sight.
{\an2}Maybe, at first smile.
{\an2}Are you serious?
Are you going to sit here like this?
{\an2}What should I have done?
Shouldn’t I have given my shirt?
{\an2}Protecting and looking after him is
another part of my job.
{\an2}I'm so glad that you're here.
{\an2}We’ve been trying to find a chance
to meet you as well
{\an2}I have so many things
I want to ask.
{\an2}I don’t know where to start.
{\an2}If I may, I will begin with the most
important one that I'm curious about.
{\an2}Of course, go ahead.
Let us get to know each other.
{\an2}Did you breastfeed him?
{\an2}Yes.
{\an2}For how long?
{\an2}About 15 months.
{\an2}He wouldn’t get sick then.
{\an2}Our daughters didn’t.
{\an2}We fed them with baby formula.
{\an2}It didn’t go dry, though.
{\an2}I drank all that milk
so it wasn’t a total waste.
{\an2}I'm still so strong now thanks to that.
{\an2}Breast milk is really healthy.
{\an2}Right, Muzaffer?
This is such an important topic.
{\an2}Please, eat. More is coming.
{\an2}Please, there will be more.
{\an2}He's really good
at talking nonsense, wife.
{\an2}He would be a nice partner
in my retirement.
{\an2}Ferhat, I must admit
I was wrong about you.
{\an2}Elif,
{\an2}I must say that you're beautiful.
{\an2}Don’t laugh.
{\an2}You're everything that I’ve longed for.
{\an2}Protect me.
{\an2}You wouldn’t lose anything,
but I would lose everything.
{\an2}If you hadn't entered into my life,
I wouldn’t have thought of opening
{\an2}a restaurant where homeless people
cook for homeless people.
{\an2}KITCHEN OF THE STREET
{\an2}Do you like it?
{\an2}I have told you, right?
We have a grand opening in two weeks.
{\an2}Maybe I haven’t done
everything right so far,
{\an2}but if you hold my hand...
{\an2}<font color="white">And people change.</font>
{\an2}My boy, my dear boy.
{\an2}Let me ride it, it is my turn.
{\an2}Come on, daddy.
