This is the thing we were talking about.
Our family has obtained many fuels and resources
motivated by the humiliation caused by the steam engine.
And we have finally found the ultimate element.
By destroying its atomic bonds,
an enormous destructive power is created.
I named this element "uranium."
Please accept the wonderful power of this uranium
bomb to the central headquarers.
No.
There is no need for such a strong bomb.
Even if you introduce it we don't need such a thing.
Are you scared, State Alchemist?
You guys gained social status and political power from
the nation that used your dream to spread alchemy.
"your dream"?
You're scared that my invention would be recognized
at Central and alchemists would become unnecessary.
Let me see your body.
How fragile!
With such cheaply made armor!
Huh? It can't be.
Empty. Why? Why was he moving?
It can't be. I don't understand.
You made two mistakes.
Who the hell are you?
Brother, you're late!
There's a hole in my body.
Oh sorry, sorry.
Who the hell are you guys?
Mistake number one:
We were never interested in your invention from the star
W...what?
We just came since you were so persistent
If you value your life, take me to Central!
Mistake number two:
The State Alchemist you were lookingfor...
That's me.
A metal body... auto mail?
So you're the Full Metal Alchemist!
What's this?
Shit, you damn alchemist.
If you guys didn't exist,
us physicists would have rightfully guided the nation.
Just like that?
Mining uranium is accompanied with danger.
Science that does not make people happy isn't science.
Stop!
If you move...
I will make him explode!
There was a time I reluctantly learned alchemy.
With this genius, it was easy to acquire alchemy.
What are you trying to do?
I will merge them with the machines
and give them life once more.
All in order to defeatyou guys!
Stop! That's human transmutation.
A human...
cannot transmute a human body or a human life.
That is the biggest taboo in alchemy.
I don't care about your taboos.
I'm a genius!
Stop!
Where is this place?
It's like that day when we tried
to transmute our dead mother.
I also lost my body that time.
You fixed my soul on to a suit of armor
at the cost ofyour arm, but...
Everything is an equivalent taade.
But I will definitely get your body back.
Your arm and leg too.
Let's go.
This castle is going to explode soon.
Why?
I didn't like it so I destroyed a bunch of places.
Why do you always act with out thinking?
Be quiet, I can't undo what I already did.
So. let's go!
I'm goingto disappear!
My soul is tied to the armor with this!
It's all right, I'll do something about it.
We're going to sink, Let me borrow your head.
What are you doing, give it back!
Idiot, let go! We're going to sink!
So that's how the righteous State Alchemist's name
was known throughout the continent.
Man, your stories are always like this.
You're saying I made the story up?
A world where alchemy has developed and
became more useful than a steam engine?
Alchemy declined and disappeared by the present day.
It's common sense of history.
That's only in this world.
Hey!
Hey!
Are you all right, Alphonse?
It's been getting cold.
The carnival?
Yeah.
Get on.
These gypsies say they're going
to put up a store at the carnival.
What kind of a store are you guys going to put out?
Various kinds. Songs. plays...
What about you?
She's a forune teller.
She's known to be very good to the
point where's it's almost scary.
She can tell you everything you
don't want anyone to know.
I want her to try me.
Don't bother with such an unscientific thing.
You're the same.
You don't have a home town.
I see it!
It's the carnival!
Oh. Noa! Long time no see
Its a French Franc. Marks are worh less than paper.
You stay here.
You sold me.
You can read people's minds just bytouching them
Your clairvoyance is real.
There are people that would like to borrow that power.
Where is Ureshio?
He's outside.
Is it this girl?
Its really popular.
There has been a space fad since Obelt's book cane out
Thanks.
All right. open it
Okay.
Edward-san
I'l go take a nap over there.
my neck hurs.
Youre not going to take a look?
He was realy enthusiastic when
we met him at Obelt-san's place.
Please help!
Are you a gypsy?
They're after me!
You probably stole someones wallet.
You're all thieves.
Wherever I go I can't escape from here.
You shouldn't mess with that.
There's fuel in it
There she is, over here!
Come!
Hey!
This gypsy hroke the agreenent
Come!
Help!
Stop it, this is a carnival.
Didn't I tell you?
We bought this gypsy.
It's been quite a while.
Nothing will happen but...
Its dangerous!
I saw it.
Res-san !
Did I tell you?
He's the person that said he can be our patron.
You guys seen like you can make what we want.
Please cooperate with us.
Ah, thanks.
Lieutenant.
I'm sorry, the girl ran away.
Ran away?
Hey you where's your house?
I don't have such a place.
Then why?! Wouldn't a war like that be pointless?
Is that really the case?
Ran away?
How troublesome.
I thought that she would be able to find the great snake.
I'm sorry.
Let's go to the villa.
I must report to Eckheart-sama.
Yes,sir
Is it really ok? I...
It can't be helped if youre being chased...
And I'm a bit glad.
Im glad that Edward is interested in a woman.
That person is indifterent towards others.
and doesnt try to becone invoved with people.
Hes always talking ahout a different world.
A different world?
Well. I'm going to go
We can finally have our own factory.
Winry.
Winry... Alphonse...
He already left?
He was saying how they're finally
going to lave their own factory.
Should I help you?
I'm used to it.
It's been two years since I've been like this.
It moves that much?
Yeah easily.
Even if I dont have an arm and a leg, there
are signals sent through the nerves...
so it picks up the signas, expands them and..
To be honest. I don't understand it too well.
It was my dad who made it.
What happened to your father?
He disappeared one day out of nowhere
So I went over to that guy's place, and
I once studied rockets with him
A suit of armor...
There was a suit of armor walking with you.
Then a nice smile.
It was probahly your mother's.
Also...
a village in beautiful grasslands.
You said it was unscientific
But that was what I saw.
What kind of world were you in?
Its a lot like this world.
Only a few different names and places,
and there, a lot of people look the same.
Why are you here?
My brother died in the other world,
and I had to come here in orde to resurrect him.
Its compensation.
Is this world a hell given to me?
Two years ago, I met Alphonse at Romania
I thought that was how he would look
like if my little brother Al grew up.
So this place may just be my dream
Good morning, Glacier-san.
Good morning Ed.
Youre making that face again.
Do I really look like your mother?
Or maybe your girlfriend?
N-No. not really.
T-Thanks for Noa's clothes.
Noa-chan is going with you?
Be careful.
Okay.
Did you hear? From now on, you have
to pay taxes in gold and not Marks.
I don't want paper like this either.
I cant even buy a drink with it.
Then I'll take it.
whoa who said I'd give it to you?
I'll take it if you don't need it
What the hell Hughes-san.
Hey! Ed!
Edward.
Good morning officer.
So you really did start living with a gypsy woman.
I have my reasons.
You know, you and Alphonse might
have been tricked by her.
Be careful around gypsies
They're wanderers that trick men and steal their wallets.
I'm also a wanderer
Hey, if anything happens, it'll botler Glacier-san .
How about if you go and confess to Glacier-san already,
and stop worrying about others.
I think it'll work out well.
Don't mess with adults!
I don 't really think I'm heing deceived
If you lave the power to read peoples minds, then
there might be many people who want it.
Especially in a world like this.
You're going to beieve me?
I was walking with a suit of armor right?
I didn't even tell Alphonse about that.
Did you see anything else just now?
I can see better when one's sleeping to be honest.
I can see your dream.
The Berlin government is a hunch of cowards.
They dont intend to protect Gernany.
Gemany lost the war.
We can't complain even if we lose our territory.
We didn't lose!
The Communist Party and the Jews were the ones that quit.
Noa, pease get me my coat.
What the hell?
Don't be with people like her!
Whats wrong about that?
Gypsies are just like the Jews.
They don t even have their own country
and they come into Germany.
stealing our money, our jobs and our country!
Sorry about that.
It's all right.
I don't mind being called a gypsy.
My ancestors have lied that they were Egyptian
forune tellers in the first place.
Bohemian . Gitana, Nomad, they
can call me whatever they like.
Hey...
What do you guys call yourselves?
Roman.
Roman?
It means human.
Go back by yourself.
Edward!
Why...
Why is a honunculus here?
What's this over here?
What's it for?
King Bradley...
King?
If you were able to come overo this side,
then the Major has...
Major? During the war?
Don't play dumb.
Excuse me.
Do as you like.
Yeah... of course.
Theres a human that the homunculus was based on.
Its not that strange to see a human similar to him.
Did you catch the wrong person?
I apologize.
I'm Jewish, and there are patriots that assault
rich Jews like me so I'm used to it.
By the way, can you drive?
Somewhat.
Then I will ask you to substitute until he wakes up.
Wonderful.
With this it looks like we can hop out right away.
Blonde hair and blue eyes.
All of you carry the ancient Aryan blood.
You're the pride of the German race.
Chairman Eckheart should be extremely pleased.
Chairman Eckheart, the great snake has escaped to...
It seems like...
there was a witness.
Heshoy, you do it.
Yes, ma'am!
The time is almost here to go to Slambala, Professor.
It's great timing!
I just wanted a skilled person like you.
Is someone after your life?
The opposite.
I'm after Dragon.
Dragon?
Call me Mabuzee.
There you go.
It is rumored that a thief that came into
this abandoned castle and saw it.
Saw what?
Dragon.
Its supposed to be a huge snake.
So you came here to confirm such a rumor.
There's a reason I really wantto find the real Dragon.
Are you gonna make medicine out of it or something?
I should escape sometime soon.
Edward Elric.
What is this?
I found you!
Edward!
Are you Envy?
The homunculus that my father made.
Why tle hell do I have to fight over here, too?
Who are these guys?
Ready the spears.
Fire!
There are many spears that are claimed
to be the true spear of Longinus.
It was a pain to collect them all.
Wait! Where are you taking it?
You should forget everything you saw today.
Wha...
Its not something a normal human should know.
You are...
Did you forget?
Thats likely...
I haven't met you since Japan before the war.
MajorGeneral Househoffer, I heard that you
were taking the teacher's school at Munich.
Did you say Househoffer?
I heard that name from my father before.
And you are?
Edward Elric.
My father's nane is Hohenheim.
Wait... you...
That was greatly successful, Professor.
The great snake is once again in our hands.
Edward Elric.
Is there something wromg?
He's Hohenheim's son.
If he really is Hohenheim's son,
then his birthplace is Shambala..
So there is one more person that safely crossed the gate.
So we meet again...
Professor, the experiment.
But even if they have armor on
sending humams in isn't good.
To Shambala!
Colonel!
Where are you Colonel?
Lieutenant Havoc, Lieutenant Breda, thank
you for coming all the way here.
It's good to see you doing well.
Please don't be so formal.
I'm a police officer.
Oh really?
Then Corporal Mustang...
It's like you, Colonel, to choose such a rural area.
but I'm doing what I can for the country in my own way.
Colonel.
I haven't used alchemy once since that day.
The Flame Alchemist?
When I try to, I see those who have
passed away due to my foolishness.
This eye...
We should have invited Lieutenant Hawkeye as well.
That person would'nt have come..
She would'nt want to see the Colonel like that.
Plus, I feel as if the person Colonel
is waiting for isn't the Iieutenant...
Then who is it?
Two months ago, she finally couldn't move anymore,
and told Al that there's nothing she can teach him amynore.
Really?
Al hasn't given up on finding Ed yet?
He believes that Ed is alive somewhere.
Apparently he sees dreams,
himself being 18 years old and with a weak body,
living with Ed, and making machines that go out im space.
Take good care of them.
Why are you looking so terrible?
I'll fix it for you.
I, Armstrong,
will fully cooperate with Lior's administration,
and construct Central's administration here.
You guys can witness the new age of
city making that represents the east.
I will give this store to you.
What a splendid performance.
This is... a transmutatiom circle?
Everyone, over here!
Who's doing such a thing in a city
almost destroyed by alchemy...
Where are they coming from?
Transmuting a tornado?
Al!
Please respond, Lior!
Lior!?
Is there also an earhquake at Lior?
A the same time with Central?
And a large anount of enemy troops supposedly
appeared, though unidentified.
Theres a strict surveillance gate at the east.
There's no enemy that would suddenly cross the border...
Damn..
Alphonse Elric.
It's Major Armstrong.
You've met him before.
Roze-san!
He helped us on the journey, right?
So your memory hasn't come back yet.
That's...
I', controlling that armor by transferring
a part of my soul into it.
A part of your soul?
It looks like my soul is easily detachable.
So his memory during the four years of
traveling with Ed still is not back yet?
But him fighting the armor reminds
me of Ed accompanying Al.
Everyone inside is dead.
Its likely that they could have been dead from the start.
From the beginning?
It looks like they crossed a place with tremendous pressure.
Al, are you still searching for Ed?
Yes.
But Ed is...
Al, you will disappear too!
That means that's the only way to
make Commissioner Byern do so.
Glacier, is that Gypsy still at your...
Well, well...
War?
So there's going to be another war?
It's just that there are stupid people that say those things.
But if so, you guys will be in danger.
Like "We're going to create a country with
only Germans" or "Exile the Jews ."
Just a bunch of disturbing things.
Oh. officer.
What were you guys talking about?
Nothing in particular.
Why are you making such a scary face?
Who knows what the gypsy might be planning.
Just like you guys.
Always planning something in the beer hall.
Please, she's weak.
Protect her.
During that war, Germany still had the power to fight.
But the government surrendered and accepted
the disgraceful Treaty of Versailles.
There are many people that want to defeat the current
German goverment to retrieve the pride of Gernmany
Are you working for those types of people, Alphonse?
I just want to make rockets.
What about Edward-san?
You said he's going to Munich College, right?
Yes, hes looking for someone.
Househoffer's classes have beem closed fora while now.
Apparently he's too busy with the Thule organization,
so he's been at the villa recently.
Thule?
You don't know ?
Thule is the mysterious norhern island known in myths
The Thule organization investigates for the
power of the gods inhabiting the island.
It's the holy power that'll save Germany!
God, Satan, the occult, how would
anyone save a country with that?
Shit, there's quite a lot of security
for a college professor's villa.
Ow...
Can Alphonse's patron actually be...
Looks like a magic circle.
Summonimg the devil by sacrificing a virgin ...yeah right.
What a joke.
No, this is... a transmutation circle!
You're not supposed to be able
to use alchemy in this world.
This transmutation circle is incomplete.
What am I doing?
Fven if I write such a thing. I can't
use alchemy in this world.
Youre stupid as usual, little boy.
Envy?
Shambala.
What the hell is this?
I didn't...
You're...
How did the gate open?
It didnt open no matter what we did before.
Did they come back from Shambala?
Come back?
What did you do? Talk, kid
Inspect them. Is everyone alright?
They're crushed!
Crew members dead.
Survivors:
none.
Did You do this?
There is an underground kingdom bigger
than anywhere in this world.
It is protected deep within the mountains.
It is a utopia with no war, disease, suffering or hatred.
Being a citizen there promises eternal peace,
and the army witb mysterious powers
promises the victory for the fimal war.
The path to Shambala wasn't a rumor.
It seems that the rumor was true, professor.
Chairman Eckheart, this is Edward Elric.
Your father used to be interested in the
Thule organization for a period of time.
I don't know what be said but-
I am Betrine Eckheart.
Whatever Thule or Shambbala is,
you see to be interested im finding legendary countries.
You're the same.
Wait, Hess,
that person's plan is almost finished.
If this guy's connected to Berlin...
Wait, wait!
Stop!
Brother?
Brother!
Brother!
Ow, ow !
Brother brother!
Brother!
Ouch!
OUCH!
Brother!
Huh?
But were you alwavs this tall?
What do you mean by "were you always this tall?!"
It's unmanned.
What's that?
I don't know.
Perhaps that is alehemy...
It's the devil-
the devil has been set loose!
Fire! Fire!
You did something again, right?
You're a prankster as always.
You...
Anyways, we're getting out.
Okay..
Which way?
Run!
Which way?
Just run!
Which way?!
I'm sorry,
but we know where they are.
He's related to that Alphonse.
That knowledge is valuable,
but he won't cooperate.
He's just like his father.
We will use that gypsy.
Where is she?
That womam is actually with Edward
Elric and Alphonse Heidrich.
We received this information from the party member.
It seems as if God is blessing us
Are you planning to open the gate again?
I can't believe that its actually Shambala over there.
Everyone died.
There's only 10 days until November 8th.
The Fuhrer intends to do things without
the Thule organization's support.
If left this way we won't be in a good position.
There's nothing to worry about.
The gate will open that day.
The situation is fulfilled due to the Thule organization.
That's how it will he called in the future.
What is this?
You've been like this since you came back.
Brother...
This is a beautiful city, is this really inside the gate?
This place is beyond the gate.
More importantly
You're really Al?
But why are you in an arnor with just your soul again?
Again? What do you mean by again?
Oh yeah, I was pretending to be an armor beside you.
I', sorry brother, but I don 't remember anything.
You don't remenber?
After the day we transmuted our mother,
when I noticed I was being taken to
Central by a person named Roze,
I believed that you were alive somewhere,
and that I'd get you back.
Hey-
How did they open the gate?
Brother, my technique to transfer
souls doesn't last very long.
I think it's already time.
Al... Al!
Are you going to disappear?
But I found out a way to get you back.
I will open the gate from that side too.
Youre late.
Did something good happen?
Well, you probably won't believe it.
but I met Al.
My little brother Al.
Maybe Ill be able to go back.
Yes?
You're Babuzee.
Babuzee?
It looks like you're snifting around
Major General Househoffer.
Are you his ally?
Tbere's something I want to tell you
Can you come to Ufer in Berlin?
What the hell...
Alphonse,
do you know what Ufer is?
It's been a while.
Sorry,
I'm in no situation to make a phone call.
It's alright. But Al isn't here.
He's not?
He disappeared. Al, and Wrath too.
I see.
They're probably at Central.
Yeah.
Lior and Central
the two cities where the disaster occurred at the same time.
Their common point-
he probably came to the same conclusion as I did.
Is it somethimg related to Ed, perhaps?
I cant say anything as of now.
You can't wait for them this time?
I really want to go...
I don't want just Al to find Ed.
Looking at this.
Even then, it improved greatly just by looking at that.
Doctor Mabze looks like a movie you made.
Just out of playfulness.
It's Fritz Langue.
I was thinking about going to America.
I'm reading the novels from there to study English.
Its a cheap suspense novel, but it's interesting.
There are many scientific ones, called "Scientific Romance."
There was something really interesting among them.
It says that there's a world similar to the one we're living in,
but with some differences that runs parallel with this world.
I suppose it should be called a parallel universe.
In that parallel world, dragons and magic may exist,
or alchemy might be developed rather than science.
And Fritz Langue may be a criminal with
the same face instead of a film director
he might even be a woman.
It's pleasant to imagine such things.
Those are merely dreams.
Dreams, huh?
But I wonder which is the dream and which is the reality.
You won't ever understand about people living in dreams.
And what did you want to tell me?
Its Carl Househoffer's book.
I met him on an island nation called the Japanese empire.
This country is strangely a single
tribe and is ruling a country.
But the German tribe doesn't just live in Germany.
"To unite those tribes and create a
nation with only German tribes"
Such things are written on there.
I'm not interested.
One more thing: Shambala.
This is a utopia in the oriental legends,
but those who rule there can rule the world.
They believe in that.
Do you know what this is?
This is...
The Thule organization assists the Nationalist Socialist Party,
also known as the Nazi political party.
and still has a strong influence on this party.
Nazis?
The Nazis plan to make a big escape
on Berlin in November.
It's said that if they have an uprising with such a small force,
they will be suppressed by Berlin.
But the Thule organization promised victory to the Fuhrer.
Thats what they showed as proof of the promise.
Its supposed to be a powerful bomb.
And it's something not even fathomed in this world.
Househoffer and them supposedly said
that in exchange for power and budget,
they will bring more and more of these
weapons from beyond the gate.
Use that world for an armed uprising?
What are you planning to do?
I can't let them open the gate anymore.
Let them be. I called you yesterday wanting to tell you that.
Let those who want to have war have war.
However, I want you to cooperate with my job.
For what purpose were you investigating the Nazis?
My wife is a follower othe Nazi's President, Hitler.
Through her, I have been asked to cooperate
with the Nazis nany times,
but I am what they are trying to exile, a Jew.
I will merely be used then thrown away.
Im not interested in such a foolish reality.
You're pretending to be living in a dream,
but you're actually scared that the dream
will be taken over by reality.
Excuse me, but where are you taking me?
It's not a bad deal, even for you.
Please listen.
The President plans to use the storm troopers or the revolt.
Gailing and the others?
I told you that we can take part in the revolt.
On the day of the revolt, let's open the path to Shambala.
That's great!
The girl was in the city. We'll prepare quickly.
The launch date is November 8th.
We're told to finish up before that
Lets show the world that Germany hasn t lost.
Is that ok?
If that gate opens, you can go back.
The idiots wanting to drag our world into war will follow.
But-
I found out that Al is alive over there.
I was always worried that I screwed up.
So it's okay.
Alpbonse, I have something to say
about your work.
Stop your job with the rockets.
I'm busy with the job,
so I'm going to stay at the job site starting today.
They're planning to have a war
with the world I used to be in.
That rocket must be related to it.
Alphonse!
I don't have the time,
this is my world.
I want to leave behind proof that I was alive.
You dont have the right to tell me anything!
Alphon--
The gate wont open anyways, right?
So we don't know if A- kun is in Central or not, do we?
Yes, so In worried...
Wrath is with him too.
After Izumi-san died,
there was nothing holding Al back anymore.
I understand.
I'll guide you to that underground
city after visiting the grave.
Huh?
Elysia and the others might bave been here, too.
Why did you take me here?
It's all right.
It's just like Lior.
I'm hungry.
Is there anymore white sausage left?
How rare, it's not beer.
You should stay home today.
Tonight, this country will be reborn again.
That's what the festival is for.
He's from theThule organization.
Hey, Noa?
Noa, where are you going?
What the hell are you guys doing?
You probably dont know, but they're-
A war is starting.
The weak revolutionary government will be overthrown,
and our Fuhrer will lead this country.
Noa will cooperate with this.
Did I not tell you?
All the men around here belong to the same political party,
the National Socialist Party.
Noa?
Yeah.
This is the Gypsy girl we've been looking for the whole time.
Thanks for holding them up in Munich.
Why is she here?
She's the key to open the gate...
...to Shambala!
Is this... really...
You must have seen it already
within Edward Elric's head.
So you were able to see all of Edwards knowledge?
Y...yes.
Magical circle...
no, they call it the transmutation circle.
What's the spell charm?
There were no spells in his memory.
If he brings power between himself
and the transmutation circle...
It's almost as if someone's knocking
the door from the other side...
It's been a while since we've snuck in like this.
So the former Fuhrer is ahead of us?
Why?
What's missing?
That time...
I saw the gate.
If that's the same thing,
if I want to go over there,
I have to transmute myself.
Gluttony...
Gluttony?
He's also a monster like me.
On November 8th,
at the fair ball where the big wheels
of the Byern state will gather,
the leader of the Germen National
Socialist party will be shot.
We will invigorate the state troops and from
there we will advanee towards Berlin.
We will take the country's power immediately.
Let's Hurry
Lets open the path to Shambala,
and get their army and their arms onto ourside.
But we haven't investigated enough.
You're still saying things like that!
So the gate wont open by just taking away the knowledge...
Can you drive?
Somewhat.
I didn't even have to go pick him up.
So you came for us.
It really seems like only you can open the gate.
So you were using Noa as my substitute.
Stop.
Your world is beyond that thing, isn't it?
It's not Shambala.
I guarantee that.
I wanted to see it.
No, I wanted to go there.
It's there, right?
Where no one will betray me or be scared of me...
A country just for me!
So you wanted a country
Are you going to continue traveling
without belonging to any country?
I thought it was your pride.
I want to see the dream.
What's beyond there isnt a dream.
Now...
Tramsmute us...
then the gate will open...
to meet us...
I see.
The homunculi were catalysts over there too...
as the catalyst of those to see the gate.
This is why I came.
I don 't want to see such a thing.
Never!
But...
I wan't to go back to my mom's place.
Hurry!
You'll hit him.
Father!
Wbat is this?
What the hell is this?
This was the most effective way to calm down this dragon.
Good for us be doesn't die so easily.
Hey...you finally came.
Geez...
You...what are you doing?
I wanted to make a path to the otherworld
with this worlds magic and science,
so I proposed this to Househoffer.
Ill help you now.
Stop.
This is what I wished for.
I am a sinner.
I created such a monster by messing
up my son's resurrection.
so I threw him away.
But I continued to live by transferring to other people.
Why!?
Why did you lend a hand to these guys!?
...for me to return?
By sacrificing my life,
I will transnute Envy to the gate.
I don't want such a thing!
Say hello to Al...
Prepare the rocket.W ere going througb the gate.
You're lucky, Edward san.
Alphonse.
You can go back.
Eckheart is confused trying to get on the rocket.
so if now ...
Hess, tell the Fuhrer how things are going.
Ask Professor Househoffer to stabilize the gate.
Please stop.
I really don't think that's Shambala.
Edward is right.
I know that already.
It hit your prosthetic arm and only scratcbed you.
With this rocket that goes beyond 11 kilometers per second,
we will break througb the phenomena within the gate,
and reach the other side.
That's wbat Professor Househoffer thinks.
Even with this one-man rocket, there will be enough speed.
Wait. I never said that I would go over tlere.
I want you to go.
Alphonse... am I bothering you?
We're not an existence in your dream.
Even if I die,
I'm still myself.
I am definitely here.
Don't forget me.
Alphonse! Alphonse!!
Alphonse!
Whats going on?
Ed!
Noa...
Take me, Ed.
Take me!
What is that?
This is...
This power...
my magic has become reality!
Ouch...
What is this place?
I don't know, but we're saved.
Don't you like that kind of stuff?
It's not artistic.
Winry!
Al!
What is that?
All I did was open the gate.
Gate?
Ouch...
Ed.
Where were you?
Winry...
Welcome back.
Yeah.
Brother.
Noa?
Yeah.
This is the Gypsy girl we've been looking for the whole time.
Thanks for holding them up in Munich.
Why is she here?
She's the key to open the gate...
...to Shambala!
Is this... really...
You must have seen it already
within Edward Elric's head.
So you were able to see all of Edwards knowledge?
Y...yes.
Magical circle...
no, they call it the transmutation circle.
What's the spell charm?
There were no spells in his memory.
If he brings power between himself
and the transmutation circle...
It's almost as if someone's knocking
the door from the other side...
It's been a while since we've snuck in like this.
So the former Fuhrer is ahead of us?
Why?
What's missing?
That time...
I saw the gate.
If that's the same thing,
if I want to go over there,
I have to transmute myself.
Gluttony...
Gluttony?
He's also a monster like me.
On November 8th,
at the fair ball where the big wheels
of the Byern state will gather,
the leader of the Germen National
Socialist party will be shot.
We will invigorate the state troops and from
there we will advanee towards Berlin.
We will take the country's power immediately.
Let's Hurry
Lets open the path to Shambala,
and get their army and their arms onto ourside.
But we haven't investigated enough.
You're still saying things like that!
So the gate wont open by just taking away the knowledge...
Can you drive?
Somewhat.
I didn't even have to go pick him up.
So you came for us.
It really seems like only you can open the gate.
So you were using Noa as my substitute.
Stop.
Your world is beyond that thing, isn't it?
It's not Shambala.
I guarantee that.
I wanted to see it.
No, I wanted to go there.
It's there, right?
Where no one will betray me or be scared of me...
A country just for me!

Al!

Gate?
Ouch...
Ed.
Where were you?
Winry...
Welcome back.
Yeah.
Brother.
Brother.
Schiezka.
Welcome back, brother.
Yeah.
What is that?
A weapon from the other world.
They're here to attack this world,
in order to use this world's power over there.
Did you make that gate?
Al!
Ouch...
Honestly...
I thought you'd be like this when you came back.
Do you plan on fighting with those arms?
Wow, you had this the whole time?
Winry-
but I've grown.
Who do you think I am?
Who the hell are those guys?
Bastards!
Behold... this artistic transmutation!
Major!
Armstrong-dono, what are those?
They seem to be the ones that appeared in Lior.
Falman, Fury, behind you!
Colonel!
Colonel Mustang!
Warrant Officer Falman, protect the
building with the troops at hand.
Yes, sir.
Sergeant Major Fury, message the armored unit
and immediately deploy the tank group within the city.
Stop the enemy's movement.
Look, the Corporal is giving orders.
Ensigns Havoc and Breda.
Yes, sir.
These headquarters are the final fortress.
Get the Generals together,
and make them signal to retrieve
the soldiers from each garrison.
Yes,sir.
Armstrong...
In order to take down the enemies in the sky...
Yes, a balloon.
I'm going
We have been waiting.
Good. Try standing up.
Don't say it like it's so easy. This hurts quite a bit.
It fits perfectly!
I know how much you would have grown.
There are more.
Stay away!
It looks like this place is this worlds metropolis.
Disappear.
So they're here.
Edward Elric!?
Ouch...
There was a path Wrath told me about.
Wrath did?
Yes...
I transmuted the gate with Wrath.
Al...
Stop!
You can't resurrect a dead human.
Brother, is it my fault?
Why did it have to be like this?
I just wanted to-
You just wanted to get me back, right?
Wrath just wanted to help you do it.
The Al from the other world just wanted to get me back too.
Noa just wanted her own country.
No one wished or a war like this.
We didn't wish for this,
but this battle is our fault.
Do you understand?
So we have to protect this world,
As long as we're alive, we can't be irrelevant to this world.
we can't be unrelated to this world.
How is it?
This is all we could make.
That's good enough.
Please wait!
Hawkeye-dono.
With my power, there is only room for one.
But no, you can't!
Winry-san, look!
Ed!
Its been a while but you're still good.
Don' to mess with me.
Now! Lengthen it, Full Metal!
Colonel!
It looks like you brought over this trouble.
Sarcasm already?
But man, that eye patch doesnt match you well.
Excuse him.
Look, go from the front.
That's why I came.
Yeah, Ill do that.
Brother, wait!
I knew that you were alive.
Why?
Why is my magic being thwarted?
This is a new world completely different from ours..
There's nothing different.
People live, cry, laugh, and die.
I want to ask one thing.
Why did you attack all of a sudden?
Weren't you going to use this world's
powers at the war in the otherworld?
I will destroy this world.
For what reason?
It's dreadful.
When I realized that there was another world when
we opened the gate with the great snake's power,
and realized that there exists a power that surpasses us,
I was scared, scared out of my mind.
Then thought that I must destroy it.
The people here won't start an attack against you guys.
How can you know?
We're the same human beings.
You're wrong!
Even if their looks and forms are the same,
they are monsters from another world.
So that's what you really think.
That's what I feel.
People can't truly accept those that are different from them.
Rejecting and fearing-
thats what starts wars.
To me, you also look like a monster.
So I can kill you.
Kill him!
What?
I transferred a part my soul to all of these armors.
Don't come here...
Don't come here!
Stop! Stop!!
STOP!
Is it over?
Yes.
Full Metal?
Brother?
Brother!
With that much material, you guys can make it.
Where are you going?
I am returning all of these guys to beyond the gate.
You don't have to go too!
I need to destroy that gate.
Al, you destroy that gate too.
So the path will never open again.
What are you going to do with Winry?
Tell her that I said thanks or this.
Brother! Brother!! Brother!!!
BROTHER!
That's probably Ed.
Yeah...
So you're not going to let us wait.
The rebellion was a failure!
The backup fron Munich realized our plan,
and stopped the newspapers within the police force.
The troops were annihilated on the way.
What happened to the Fuhrer?
So he didn' t make it.
What is that monster?
God...
Once more...
open the gate...
and take me...
to Shambala...
Noa...
Thats right...
I came back.
Why?
Why did you come back, Ed?
I wonder why.
So you're going to destroy the gate, brother.
You still had your soul transferred?
I won't be able to hear it much longer
Al! But why?
I jumped over to your side at once.
Then I hid in this so you wouldn't find me.
The Colonel should be destroying the
gate from the other side by now.
You're going to destroy this gate too, right?
You won't be able to go back.
I wanted to be with you.
I want to see things with you, and
I want to grow up with you.
We can go on a journey again .
Al, your memory has...
It looks like its coming back.
The principle of equivalent trade...
It'll be hard without alchemy.
We'll he able to do sonething if we're together.
Movies and weapons are both the
fruits of scientific technology.
If so, I will continue to make movies.
From brilliant daydreams to another
world that should not exist.
Brother, how far are we going?
First of all,
I must find the uranium bomb that was brought over here.
Such a thing isn' t needed in either of the worlds.
There will probably be another big war.
That must be something that's already decided.
Is it ok for us to be involved?
I can't think that this world is unrelated to me anymore.
This is our world.
There is no difference.
We will live on here.
