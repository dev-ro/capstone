Hello.
Okay, sir. Okay.
Raghuveer, you're still awake.
Surprisingly, for the first time in seven years
I am seeing you smile.
You will be released tomorrow.
That's why you are happy, right?
I'll be seeing my sister after a long time.
I can't explain how happy I am.
You really love your sister, don't you?
- Yes!
In all these years, you never met your family.
Neither did you speak to anyone.
You're a good man.
How did you land up here?
I have spent seven years in this jail.
But my story dates back even longer.
I was just 11 years old.
I was visiting the temple with
my mom and my younger sister.
He's my son Raghuveer and she's my daughter Sona.
Please make an offering in their names, priest.
Sure, dear.
Mom, you promised to take me to my dad.
That's where we're going, son.
- Here's the offering.
Won't you offer the coconut, dear?
I completely forgot, priest.
- Do it now.
My mom used to say
that a rotten coconut brings bad luck.
And that's exactly what happened.
My dad had married someone else.
He humiliated my mom.
- Get out of here!
And broke all ties with us.
My mom couldn't take this betrayal.
She was completely shattered.
She kept weeping the entire day, hugging us.
And left us forever.
Mom.
Mom.
Mom!
What happened?
Who is she?
She's my mom.
She's dead.
- Dead!
Here you go, priest.
- Bless you.
Stop!
Who built this tomb here?
This field belongs to them.
Why are you bothered?
I own this field.
His mom had taken a loan from me.
So, the council has decided that I can seize this field.
Get rid of this tomb, now!
- I'll repay your debt.
Don't break my mom's tomb.
He says he will repay your debt.
Give him a chance.
At first, his dad eloped.
Then his mom died.
He's still a kid.
How will he repay my debt?
He'll plough the field and pay you back.
- Him?
I'll toil day and night.
And repay your entire debt.
Otherwise, I will repay your debt.
Fine. Every year the involvement
should reach me on time.
Its installment, not involvement.
Whatever.
Let's go.
Sir!
Don't cry, Sona.
Mom used to say, that star is you and that's me.
Come on.
Don't worry, Raghu.
Your sister's going to top her exams.
Break the coconut.
Wow!
There's a flower inside.
She's definitely going to excel now.
Sona.
Sona. Your books.
- Hey! Be careful.
You know that she'll drop them if you interrupt her.
Gauri, it's my exam today, I won't need them.
Take them along, Sona.
You can score better if you copy.
You're too much.
- Is it?
Let's go.
You remember everything, right?
- Yes.
Concentrate on your studies.
And do well in your exams.
Yes.
- Why don't you go with her?
Why?
- How many times will you tell her...
Do good, do good.
Hey! A hottie just boarded the previous bogie.
Sona has always done well...
Where did he go?
"You've cast a spell on me."
"My heart's fallen for you."
"You've cast a spell on me."
"Baby, I love you."
- Come on.
"Baby, I love you.
Baby, I love you."
"Baby, I.."
Nice song.
You sound good too.
But teasing girls is wrong.
- What did he say?
Wrong!
Who are you to interfere?
Move!
See that!
I'll stab you with this.
What the...
Check and mate.
Someday, I'll definitely beat you.
I'm also waiting for that day.
- Hello, sir.
I heard that your sister's taking her college exams.
Yes.
She's a pretty intelligent and smart girl.
Sona.
- Not again, brother.
Sona, you see those stars in the sky...
That one's me and the other one's you.
Mom used to say that, right?
That means, after Sona's marriage
one of the stars will disappear.
Mind your own business.
And...
Brother, shall I take the eggs to the market tomorrow?
Yes.
But be careful.
I didn't say that to her.
You keep dropping stuff.
It happened only twice today.
Hello!
Priest, what brings you here at this hour?
After a long search
I've found a suitable match for Sona.
He has a big post in a big American company.
Then, he'll definitely take his bride abroad.
Of course, in a big airplane...
This offer's too big for us.
I don't accept it.
Anyone else would've pounced on this opportunity.
I don't want a prince for my sister.
Then?
I want a boy who can stay here and look after her.
"He's like a loom in the sea."
"Music is what we make.."
"That's right, feel that.."
"That's right"
"feel that.."
"That's right"
"feel that.."
"My heart goes.."
"My heart goes.."
"My heart goes.."
Ram! Where are you?
- On the beach.
On the beach, with the girls?
All by yourself.
You didn't invite me.
You've become selfish.
- Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
That's my trick.
This is what I do when your mom scolds me.
Hello. I can't hear you.
- Okay.
Enjoy yourself. Have fun.
- Thanks, dad.
Wow!
He heard this though.
I heard that you made a donation
to the Royal Australian Orphanage.
It's a petty amount.
10,000 Dollars.
You call that a petty amount.
You could've spent that money for PR activities.
Or thrown a party for your business colleagues.
Think about the profits.
- We anyway throw parties.
Stop wasting money on useless things.
You know that I don't like it.
Hi, dad!
Bad mood?
Tell me.
I'm your best friend.
Did mom yell at you again?
Thank you very much.
- Why?
For not asking whether she beat me up or not.
You know how she is.
Then, why the long face?
- I'm not upset.
Do you know why the world's
greatest philosopher was happy?
Because he knew how to tolerate his tyrannical wife.
He...
Angry bird!
Hello.
It wasn't about you.
I was talking about Socrates' wife.
Hello, brother-in-law.
Krishnakant speaking.
How are you?
Trying to get along with your sister.
What's new in that?
It's your brother from India.
Hello. Yes, brother.
- Sister. How are you?
How are you?
- Everything is good.
So what's new?
Too many things, but the biggest news is
Riya's getting engaged on the 14th of this month.
So soon!
Was she in love?
- Exactly.
I objected but she cried, so I had to agree.
But is the boy from a good family?
I mean, are they rich?
- That's exactly why I agreed.
Listen.
Reach here as soon as you can.
Because you have to handle the arrangements.
Don't forget to tell brother-in-law and...
Hello, aunt.
- Yes, dear.
Riya speaking.
- Congratulations. How are you?
Fine, aunt, Bring Ram along too.
- Ram?
We haven't met since our childhood.
Sure, dear.
Bye.
Ram.
- Yes, mom.
Ram.
We're going to India.
India!
India!
- You aren't going.
Why?
- You have to attend a conference in the US.
Don't you remember?
- Oh, yeah.
America, yo!
Stop!
Mr. Raghuveer.
Riya, how are you?
A chocolate for you.
You never forget to get me chocolates, do you?
Welcome the bride.
- Bride?
When are you getting married?
Next Friday...
That's just 15 days.
And you are both invited.
- Of course.
We'll reach there two days in advance.
Just two days?
I have come here to take Sona right now.
Now?
- Of course.
Sona, when would you expect me to come over
for your wedding?
- I don't know, ask brother.
Sir!
How many days before
do you expect me to come for Sona's wedding?
At least 15 days.
- Right.
My wedding is just 15 days later.
I'm just like your sister.
Please send her along.
Please...
Please.
Actually, I have never sent her alone anywhere.
She has also never stayed away from you.
But you will have to send her along.
Please...
Please. Please. Please.
Do you want to go, Sona?
I won't, if you refuse.
Go on.
Be careful!
Let's go!
"My heart searches everywhere."
"Confuses me as it goes."
"My heart searches everywhere."
"Confuses me as it goes."
"Makes gestures all the time."
"Makes me stagger."
"Gets upset."
"Makes excuses."
"I wish someone steals it away."
"So, I'm rid of it.
- Oh, Lord."
"I wish someone steals it away."
"So, I'm rid of it.
- Oh, Lord."
Hey, my coconut! Give me my money.
- Bye!
Hey! Hi, I'm Ram.
What's up, beautiful?
May I know your name please?
- Paro.
Hi!
- Dad, mom!
"It's aware, naive.
Never listens to me."
"I keep thinking all the time.
But it never understands."
"It's aware, naive.
Never listens to me."
"I keep thinking all the time.
But it never understands."
"It's always lost in a different world."
"Makes excuses."
"I wish someone steals it away."
"So, I'm rid of it.
- Oh, Lord."
"I wish someone steals it away."
"So, I'm rid of it."
"So, I'm rid of it."
"It has unsure intensions."
"Simple wishes and fragile dreams."

"So, I'm rid of it."
- Ram!
Look, what a big bouquet I've brought for you.
I.. I am Bijli.
Bijli!
Nephew.
Nephew.
Uncle.
- My dear!
Put your leg down.
That's enough.
He's naughty!
Who is this beauty and the beast?
She's my distant relative.
She too.
- And I'm a close one.
You...
Why aren't you saying anything?
Does even a vegetable vendor
in Australia speak in English?
It's okay.
Don't say a word.
A policeman, maid, fruit-seller, janitor...
Does everyone speak in English?
What's your problem?
- I am constipated.
So, why are you telling me?
You just asked, what my problem is.
Bijli. Who's that?
- Riya.
Riya!
I'm not Riya.
- Why?
I'm Riya's friend.
Why didn't you say that earlier?
It's okay.
Mistakes are common at this age.
No need to apologize.
Oh! Anklet.
Ram.
Riya!
How are you?
- Fine. Please.
She's...
- I know, she's your friend.
I mistook her for you and hugged her like this...
Riya!
- What are you doing?
She doesn't like all this.
So, what does she like?
- Riya, where are you?
Coming.
Come on, Ram.
Come on.
Not Ram!
Rather, a monkey.
So, what's your name?
I know you won't tell me.
My name's Ram.
I'm from Australia.
People say that boys who come from abroad
are spoilt, manner less, crooks and conmen.
They're right.
I am exactly like that.
So, beware.
Where's the sugar?
- Sugar...
Sugar...
What happened?
Why are you so scared?
- I thought, that monkey's back.
Who?
- The one who has come from Australia.
He was raised in Australia.
Not every foreigner is so spoilt.
It's not his fault, it's his parents'.
They raised him like this.
If I ever meet his parents
I will question them face-to-face.
Right, ma'am?
Do you know who you are talking to?
Riya's aunt.
That Australian monkey is her son.
- Is it?
"Hold.."
Need some sugar.
That's better.
"Everyone lacks a little sweetness.."
Let's go.
Welcome!
How are you, dear?
- Fine.
Hello, ma'am.
Hello.
- He's my partner in the construction business.
I see.
- JP. Jai Prakash.
Yes. He was with the Central Ministry for 20 years.
Please don't...
- She's my sister Ashwini.
From Australia.
- Hello!
Ma'am.
- Is she the one with the son?
You promised that her son and my...
- Right, right.
Then introduce me to him.
- Let's go in first.
Come in.
- Let's go.
Please, come in.
Sona, look at this.
- Nice.
I have got the news from the kitchen
that you called me a monkey.
- No!
Australian monkey.
- Wow!
My mistake.
I should've called you a gorilla.
Riya!
There he is.
Get lost.
Hi. I'm Dolly.
- Hi!
Hi, I'm Bijli.
Bijli. Bijli.
- Whatever.
Come on. Let's dance.
- Sure.
Everyone in India wears saris and salwar suits.
And it's so colorful.
Okay, dad. Take care.
Got to go.
What are you doing in my room?
This is my room.
Get out!
Sorry. My mistake.
Did you see anything?
- No, I...
Just get out.
- Thank God!
Nice horse.
Don't touch that.
My brother gifted me that.
Please!
Did your brother give it to you?
Get out of here!
- Okay.
I have a doubt.
I troubled you so much.
Any other girl would've slapped me.
But you didn't.
Does that mean...
Something-something.
- What?
Something-something.
- Nothing.
"Touch me.. Touch me.
Hold me.. Hold me.."
Ram. You're nude.
- Now, you're nude.
I didn't know, I could have that effect on women.
"Touch me.. Touch me."
Let's begin.
- Where's Ram?
Must be around.
Dear. Ram.
Ram.
Tell her to get close to Ram.
What's wrong?
Don't worry, she'll get too close for comfort.
"Let's see.."
"Who's got the strength."
"Keep a firm foot ahead."
"My friend."
This jacket belongs to that Australian monkey.
Riya!
Now I'll show you.
Mogambo's pleased!
I hate your name!
"Let's see.."
"Who's got the strength."
- Ram!
Have you seen Ram around?
- No.
But he isn't there.
Hi.
- Hi!
Hi, Dolly.
- You naughty boy.
So there you are.
- No. Here I am.
Okay, listen.
Don't make any plans for the evening.
My friends are coming over.
Okay?
Ram.
They're my friends.
Radhika. Rashmi.
- Hi!
Pooja and Aanchal.
- Hi!
These are my bermudas
my tee-shirt and those are my slippers.
Shut up and get back.
You keep working the entire day.
Come and sit here.
Wow!
- But I didn't make this.
That's why he liked it.
She's fuming.
So, who was I talking about?
- Ram. Ram!
Ram's dad is among the top 500 billionaires of Australia.
A big mansion.
100 acres of a plush estate.
And a private chartered plane.
You're not too far-off either, Dolly.
Of course.
My dad's a billionaire too.
Ministers come over for breakfast.
Actors for lunch.
And builders for evening snacks.
- Does your dad run a mess?
Don't mess with me.
So, Ram's a billionaire and so am I.
In fact, we all are rich.
We have everything.
But what about you?
- I'm rich too.
Really?
What do you have?
We have a small house back in the village.
10 acres of land. 20 bulls.
25 cows. 40 hens and 100 goats.
But I also have a brother
who loves me more than his life.
And his love is invaluable for me.
Sona. Let's go.
- Yes.
Bye, Ram!
- Bye, Sona.
What are you looking at?
Don't know how, but everyday I see something new in Sona.
But why?
- She's something.
Something-something.
Sona has finished her studies.
Get her married this year.
I will, if I find a good match.
Yes.
My son has done his graduation in agriculture.
We've been getting proposals from affluent families.
But... he wants to marry your sister.
Do you have any objection?
Sona...
- Oh! You want to take her consent.
And I will have to consult sir too.
Yeah, right.
Why are you crying on such a happy occasion?
Soon my daughter will also get
married and leave for Australia.
What a positive mentality!
What are you doing?
I've already bought tickets to Australia.
Hello.
- Now, I'll read out the wedding invitation.
Mr. Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Riya.
Who is that?
- Mr. Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Riya.
Who is that?
- Mr. Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Riya.
Priest.
Please carry on.
Mr. Krishnakant Bhargav's daughter Riya.
Stop this nonsense.
Why did you stop?
- He asked me to stop.
Please continue.
Continue. Continue.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hi!
When are you getting married?
- What?
I have a friend.
He has got 10 hens, 4 bulls and a mare.
He'll be a perfect match for you.
- Tea.
Bijli.
What's the time?
I don't have a watch.
You don't have a brain either.
- I know.
Let's go there.
- Yes, let's go.
Ma'am...
You have made this party come alive.
- Thank you.
You're the star of this party.
Why are you repeating the old lines?
Say something new.
That's very nice of you.
Only one thing is missing.
- What's that?
What's this?
- A small, petty necklace.
Looks pretty expensive though...
- It just cost Rs. 2.5 million.
You're trying to butter her up.
This wasn't required.
- It's okay.
Every time I see them together, I feel happy, ma'am.
I feel really content.
- But I feel like puking.
I can't stand it.
Hey...
Hi, guys...
- People call me Bijli Gaga...
Hey, everyone.
This is Ram. My boyfriend.
Hi!
- Come closer, Ram.
"Nothing's gonna change my love for you."
Get off me, you dirty pig.
"Pig loves you!
Pig loves you!"
Shiraz had said that.
- No, baby, it was Prabhu.
No, it was Mr. Kumar.
So, cuddling up!
- Spoilsport!
Wow!
Hi!
She's my best friend.
And she's Rinki and Jazz...
- Hi.
Ma'am, the buffet's ready.
- Okay.
You talk to them, I will be back.
Okay?
Nice party, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Why are you following me?
- My wish.
Come to the side.
Put some chicken pieces and...
- Go away.
What would people say?
That's why I am saying, come to the side.
I won't.
Your zip is open.
- You're lying.
You have a mole ten inches below your neck. Right?
"Stranger, don't leave me."
I told you...
- Your friend's calling you.
What happened?
It's stuck.
Come on.
Thanks.
What?
- You're a monkey, but a nice one.
What?
You praised me.
Not bad. Something?
- Nothing.
Something-something.
- Nothing-nothing.
Yes.
"You are my history.
You are my philosophy."
"Loveology."
"Listen to me."
"Come with me."
"Be my girl."
"Let the drums play."
"Come closer to me."
"Let the drums play.
Come closer to me."
"Listen to my heart."
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
- Extra!
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
"You're attitude.. Oh, baby."
"You're attitude.. Oh, baby."
"Get lost, go home.
Go to your mommy."
"Open your eyes.
Take me in your arms."
"Open your eyes.
Take me in your arms."
"Let me disappear in your arms."
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
- Extra!
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
"Oh, my.. Your moves are killer."
"Oh, my.. Your moves are killer."
"I won't spare you, don't mess with me."
"You're my soul.
You're precious."
"You're my soul.
You're precious."
"Don't leave me now."
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
"Baby.."
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
"Let's do the Hip-Hop, baby."
Dance with me?
Wow! Something-something?
Something-something.
He was my friend in college.
He gave me champagne to drink on his birthday party.
I was slightly drunk.
He was shooting me.
And was also trying to kiss me.
Now he's trying to black-mail me
with that clip.
He has asked Riya for money and her jewelry.
Otherwise, he'll upload the clip on the internet.
That clip's on his iPad.
Is this what you meant by 'something-something'?
Only someone of our age can solve our problem.
I didn't know what to do.
That's why I talked to you.
Let's search.
- Yes.
That way.
What now?
- Watch me.
Brother!
Why didn't you close the door?
- Why didn't you do it?
Did you have to yell so loudly?
But I...
- Wait.
Pass me that bottle of shampoo.
Do you want to take a bath now?
What now?
Watch him run away.
He's dangerous.
- Get down. Get down.
Think about getting out of here.
Idea!
You go this way.
The dog will chase you.
And I'll escape from here with the iPad.
Was that a joke?
- No, I'm serious.
Then why don't you go out? Hey!
- Okay.
He'll bite you.
- I like it.
I totally like it.
Ma'am.
Take a seat.
Go ahead.
Keep it on my head.
Chill.
What now?
- Sing a song!
You like my voice so much!
- It will shoo away the dog.
"Who let the dogs out?"
"Who let the dogs out?"
"Who let the dogs out?"
"Who let the dogs out?"
"When the party was nice, the party was bumpin'.."
"And everybody havin' a ball."
"Until the fellas start the name callin.."
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
It's my phone.
Hey, Lisa.
I'm in the bathroom taking a shower.
Call you later.
She's my girlfriend.
- I didn't ask.
I thought you might.
Doesn't make a difference to me.
By the way, how many girlfriends do you have?
14! Including you.
I am not your girlfriend!
- Girls always say the opposite.
I mean, I am.
- That's what I said.
But I...
- Oh, come on.
There were other boys and girls at the party too.
But you asked for my help.
Why?
Because you consider me a friend.
Girl, friend. Girlfriend.
Fine.
But not the other type.
Everyone has friends.
But only one special someone makes a place in their heart.
I do have someone, you must have one too.
Who is he?
Look...
- Where?
The shower has turned off.
- Great discovery.
Think of a way to get out.
Google. Google.
Idea number two.
- What?
I'll tease the dog.
The dog will get in from here
and we'll get out from the other side.
Why didn't you think of this earlier?
So that I could say it now.
Go, go...
Let's go, Sona.
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go.
Come on. He's gone.
Come on.
Brother!
Give me my iPad back.
Or else I will shoot.
Shoot me.
- No. You shouldn't shoot girls.
Shoot me.
- No. Shoot me.
The gun's empty.
- But I still have the gun.
Rascal, how dare you blackmail girls?
What happened?
Sorry, Riya.
- Oh, my God!
Why are you bothering her?
Come on.
Here's his iPad and his phone.
Thank God!
Thanks.
- No, thank him.
No, thank Sona.
He went through a lot more trouble than me.
No. Thank her.
- Okay. Thanks to both of you.
Why should there be formalities between friends?
Right.
It's okay, I don't mind.
Okay, goodnight.
Ram.
Friends?
Only friends. Nothing else.
Okay, okay.
Friends.
What happened?
- My glass...
Go, get the ball.
Loser! Loser! Loser!
Loser!
I'll show you all.
Loser! Loser! Loser!
Please don't touch!
That was fun.
Did that horse belong to you?
- Yes.
The ball knocked it over and it broke.
Sona!
It has always been with you, right?
My brother gave this to me.
I love it more than my life.
I never thought that I'd lose it someday.
Counting the stars.
I'll also join.
One, two, three, four...
Five, six, seven
eight, nine...
I calculated wrong.
It's the same one.
The one your brother gave you.
I went through a lot of trouble to put it back together.
It had too many marks on it.
I decorated it to cover them up.
You can take it off, if you don't like it.
It's nice.
- Thanks, Ram.
Since you didn't, I thanked myself.
Okay, bye.
You called?
Why did you take so much trouble for me?
Do you want me to be honest?
- Yes.
To see this smile on your face.
Is that all?
- Yes.
Nothing else?
- No.
Not even something-something?
- No.
What?
"I feel so alive."
"I love you more than I can say."
"It's just me, my heart and you."
"So, why feel shy?"
"I never saw anyone like you."
"Where were you all my life?"
"I feel so alive."
"I love you more than I can say."
"Whenever you are close"
"I want that moment to freeze."
"I wish time stops whenever we're close."
"I wish time stops whenever we're close."
"I feel so full of breath."
"My heart skips a beat more often."
"My heart searches for you whenever it's lonely."
"Thinks about you every moment."
"My heart searches for you whenever it's lonely."
"Thinks about you every moment."
"My heart searches for you whenever it's lonely."
"Thinks about you every moment."
"Our hearts reach out to each other."
"I feel deeply in love with you."
Sir. Someone has come between you and Sona.
Who can come between us?
- See for yourself.
Come with me. Come on.
Quickly.
Quick. Look.
- Where?
That's you. That's Sona.
And there's a third star between you two.
No one can come between us.
It's just probably for a while.
Get back to work.
- If you say so.
But I was worried.
That's Sona.
That's Sona's brother.
Who's the third one?
- What?
Nothing...
Are you going to wear glasses during the rituals?
She'll wear them even on her wedding night.
Even if she does, the lights in
the room will be switched off.
You shouldn't be talking like this at your age.
At my age, all I can do is talk.
"You're my refuge, my tormentor."
"You're an unsolved riddle."
"What are my eyes looking for?"
"Beloved."
"Don't trouble me."
"Beloved."
"Don't trouble me."
"Beloved."
- Ram.
"Don't trouble me."
- Ram...
"You're an unsolved.."
Not mine.
Take your aunt's blessings.
Bless you.
- Mom.
Did you ever hit me?
- Why would she?
She'll hit your dad.
- Uncle, please.
Mom, I'm serious.
Have you ever hit me?
Never.
But...
Hi, buddy!
How are you?
Dad, did you ever hit me?
- What are you saying?
How can anyone think of hitting you?
What's wrong?
- Okay, dad. I'll call you later.
Ram!
- What?
I am sorry, Ram!
I am sorry.
Ram.
It was my mistake.
You can kiss me if you want.
Forgive me. I am sorry, Ram.
- Sona.
I am sorry.
I am sorry.
"How do they stay awake at nights?"
"And stare at the stars."
I am also sorry, Sona.
"How do they stay awake at nights?"
"How do they stay awake at nights"
"and stare at the stars?"
"Dwell in the eyes."
Ram! I am very happy today.
- Me too.
What were you two thinking?
That I won't find out?
- Please, Riya.
Please...
- While arrangements for my wedding were on...
You two were planning your own, right?
Please, Riya.
- Let me get married.
I'll get you two married too.
- Riya.
Phone.
Give it.
- Hurry up.
Sir will give the green signal.
- So much luggage?
As if your own sister's getting married.
I have a sister but Riya doesn't have a brother.
- I see.
See you.
- Hey! You forgot this.
Look after the house.
Be careful.
Gauri, be careful.
What are you doing?
- Deleting your number.
Why?
- I won't attend this wedding.
This wedding will get over today.
Tomorrow, everyone will return.
Leaving me and my daughter behind.
What are you looking at?
Look at me.
I see! So, that's the problem.
Sister.
- Yes, brother. What is it?
Can you tell him what we were talking about yesterday?
What?
About Ram and Dolly.
- Yes.
Mister.
We accept your proposal.
But let this wedding get over.
We will talk about it in detail.
Ma'am!
- Bless you.
Let's go.
The procession's arriving.
Yes, ma'am.
- What are you doing?
Give me your phone number.
Welcome. Welcome.
- Bless you.
Let that be.
Talk about cash. Money.
Where's the money?
- This way.
This way.
- Inside. Get it out!
What are you doing?
Hey! Why do you keep troubling her?
Today's the last day to have some fun.
Once the wedding is over, there
won't be any chance to do this.
What's wrong with you?
You're upset because you'll miss me in Australia, right?
- Yes.
Listen...
What are you doing?
Let go of my hand.
Ram, leave my hand.
Someone might see us.
You're always joking...
I'm going back to Australia tomorrow.
People say that boys who come from abroad are conmen
flirts and spoilt brats.
No.
I am not one of them, Sona.
I love you.
"I feel so alive."
"I love you more than I can say."
As soon as I get to Australia, I'll talk to dad about us.
And to your brother too.
Dolly. Let go. Let go!
- I love Ram.
I want to die.
- Dear, you'll hurt yourself.
What are you doing?
Ma'am...
- We should teach her a lesson.
Such girls are always on the lookout to entice rich boys.
If we don't act now, we'll lose Ram.
I mean it.
Come on.
- Ram!
Come here.
- What, mom?
You will have to go to the jewelry shop right now.
- Now?
Why?
Riya's my niece.
I wanted to gift her gold bangles on her wedding.
But I forgot to get them.
- But how am I going to choose?
Take Bijli along, if you can't do it alone.
Bijli.
- Yes, she's right.
Let's go or we'll miss the wedding.
There is no need to hurry.
Get some nice and expensive bangles.
Okay?
Come on.
Let's go.
Ma'am, would you like some tea?
How old are you?
- 20.
You look smart for your age.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go, everyone.
Who else is there in your family?
Just an elder brother.
What does he do?
- Farming.
Farming!
We have a poultry farm and we sell milk too.
Did you take your brother's permission
to attend this wedding?
- Yes, ma'am.
I never do anything without my brother's permission.
Then you must've taken his permission
to entice my son.
Why are you quiet?
- What would she say now.
Her entire plan has been ruined now.
Riya.
Your aunt's yelling at Sona.
I was really impressed with how hard this girl's working.
Now I understood what she was up to.
Why are you yelling at her?
We were busy with the wedding.
And she grabbed the opportunity to entice Ram.
Don't say that, sir.
Ram likes her too.
- Yes.
That's what her plan is.
Sir, please...
- Shut up, Riya.
Let the elders handle this. Quiet!
- But...
If you have any shame, then leave right now.
And find someone else.
See. Didn't I tell you?
She can't stay without me at all.
See. How she is crying.
Your brother's here.
Stop crying like a baby.
Riya. How are you?
Look. I've brought this wedding sari for you.
Wear this during the nuptials.
You will look really nice.
You must be Riya's dad.
I was rather young when I saw you.
I brought this shawl for you.
Brother!
What's going on?
What happened here, Sona?
- See. Both siblings are alike.
We invited you to attend the wedding
not to entice rich boys.
- What are you saying?
The sister was flirting around with a billionaire kid.
And the brother doesn't even have a clue.
Not a word against my sister or I will kill you.
If you find out about your sister's deeds
you will beat her black and blue.
No, brother.
No.
It's your fault and you are fuming at us.
Who are you?
A simple peasant who works in the fields
and owns some cattle and poultry.
You're not even fit to be our servant.
How dare you try to entice my son?
Get out!
Get out of here!
Didn't you hear what she said?
We've seen enough of your sister's dirty tricks.
Take her away.
Let's go, Sona.
Mr. Raghuveer...
Please forgive me.
It's my sister's wedding, so I'm leaving quietly.
Otherwise.. Each one of you...
Let's go.
Hurry up, Bijli. Hurry up.
We're losing time.
Not here, put it in that car.
- This car?
Where is everyone?
Here they are.
Call me as soon as you reach, dear.
Yes.
I'll bid adieu to Ram.
- Go on. But be quick.
Yes.
I want to say something before I leave.
Listen only to your heart.
You think, Sona left you.
She's left her heart behind for you.
Go, take a look in her room.
Let's go, dear.
You are getting late.
Bye, Riya.
My brother gave this to me.
I love it more than my life.
I never thought that I'd lose it someday.
Ram.
Ram.
What are you doing here?
Everyone's waiting for you.
Let's go.
- Go on, I'll join you.
We're going back home tomorrow.
You remember your promise, don't you?
You're coming with me.
- Yes, mom.
The wedding was grand.
But that girl messed things up.
- Forget her.
Look there. They look so nice.
- What?
Made for each other.
Is it not?
What's wrong with you?
Why are you so silent?
Juice?
- Leave!
Why are you thinking about her?
She came and left, just like a passing cloud.
But I.. I am still with you.
Can you wait for me?
- Of course I can.
One year?
- Yes.
Five years?
15 years?
You can't, but Sona can.
You're the passing cloud, Sona isn't.
"The clouds are thundering."
"Enraging someone."
Don't pay heed to him, dear.
He or his dad has no say in their family.
They all listen to his mom.
And she has promised me.
I know what you went through.
Rich people always behave this way.
Brother got humiliated because of me.
Still he didn't say a word to me.
He will get disturbed, on seeing you so upset.
Take my advice.
Forget everything.
I cannot forget Ram.
What?
What are you saying?
Ram didn't catch the flight!
- He was with me till Singapore.
But he never boarded the connecting flight.
He's betrayed me.
- What nonsense!
What for?
- Love.
Love?
Oh, my God!
"I'm raw and crispy.
At the prime of my youth."
"I'm like a sweet fruit.
Oh, my!"
"I'm raw and crispy.
At the prime of my youth."
"I'm like a sweet fruit.
Oh, my!"
"Sharp eyes. That can pierce
your heart. Oh, my!"
"Grab this chance."
"Give me your heart, and in return.."
"A magical hug, take it right now!"
"You won't get it again."
"A magical hug, take it right now!"
"You won't get it again."
"A kiss from these lips.
You won't get it again."
"Magical hug! Magical hug!"
"A kiss from your lips.
Give me the magical hug."
"You walk along every lane."
"Giving hugs and kisses."
"You walk along every lane.
Giving hugs and kisses."
"Take a look at me.
And I'll be lucky."
"If you want to be lucky,
if you want to be cosy."
"Hear me out. There's a gold
shop at the next corner."
"In exchange for the gold ornaments, I'll give you.."
"A magical hug, take it right now!"
"You won't get it again."
"A magical hug, take it right now!"
"You won't get it again.
A kiss from these lips."
"You won't get it again."
"My style's very special."
"My style's very special."
"Anyone loses their heart to me."
"Try to impress me with your
style and you'll be the loser."
"I'm leaving with my hug."
"No, no, beloved.
I won't try to show-off my style."
"Take anything you want,
but in return give me.."
"A magical hug, take it right now!"
"You won't get it again."
"A magical hug, take it right now!"
"You won't get it again."
"A kiss from these lips.
You won't get it again."
"Magical hug! Magical hug!"
"A kiss from your lips."
Sona.
Aren't you the station master?
And who are you?
How did you come here without a ticket?
I have a ticket.
Careful, sir.
There was a plate in the way.
Go on.
Complete the rituals.
Excuse me, sir.
You're already making me nervous.
I wonder what you will do after hearing me.
I am Ram.
The same Ram, who is in love with your sister.
Hi!
Sir. Sir.
Your sister's a really nice girl.
You don't know how long it took me to woo her.
Sorry.
It wouldn't have sounded so bad in English.
But what shall I do?
You don't know English.
My family shouldn't have insulted you.
You brought Sona home in a fit of rage.
You did the right thing.
I apologize on behalf of my family.
Please forgive me.
- Are you done?
Or do you have anything else to say?
I don't know if I made sense.
But that's what it is.
Come with me.
Raghuveer, why are you taking him inside?
What is this, sir?
He wants to talk to me in private.
Come, sir. Let's go.
He's digging his own grave.
You're completely the opposite of what I thought you'd be.
You're a complete gentleman.
Wow! Nice house.
Why is it so quiet?
It's the silence before the storm.
Afzal.
Pick him up.
And throw him out of the village.
This is your sister's problem, not yours.
And throwing him out of the village won't solve anything.
A sister can't express all her feelings to her brother.
She would've told her mom about it, had she been alive.
I've decided.
Every time I look at her, I miss my mom.
I can never forget the day
when my dad humiliated my mom.
She was so heart-broken that she died.
The rich don't value relationships.
I can tolerate whatever she is going through today.
But I don't want her to face
the same consequences that my mom did.
But...
Raghuveer.
He has come here to take his bag.
No, sir.
I'm here for Sona.
Raghuveer.
Raghuveer.
Please.
Don't separate Sona and me.
I love her more than you do.
I left my parents and everything else.
For her.
Tell me.
What shall I do to prove my love?
Tell him to leave.
A person on a death row also gets a last wish.
Won't you give me one chance?
Didn't you understand what I said?
What's making you so angry?
If your sister reminds you of your mom
then he reminds me of you, in your childhood.
Even you had begged for a chance back then.
Have you forgotten everything?
Without that one chance, you
wouldn't have made it this far.
You can't have different rules for yourself and others.
Like a fair man, you should give him a chance.
Sona.
Do you want to choose your own life partner?
Or can I also have a say in it?
You should also agree.
Sir. How do I assure you of my love?
So, you can do anything.
- Yes, sir.
You'll have to do farming.
I'll lend you one acre of land.
You'll have to grow as much of crops as I do.
You will have to wash the cows.
Clean their dung.
Would you be able to do that?
- How would he do that?
He will have to.
Leaving one's parents is not a big deal.
He'll have to toil in the fields like a farmer.
The farmer, whom his mom humiliated the other day.
Only then can he marry my sister.
I am ready, sir.
I'll do everything you said.
And grow more crops than you.
What.. What are you saying?
Then only he'll realize that I love Sona more than him.
It's not as easy as operating a computer.
It's too much of hard work.
Falling in love was easy, sir.
But I'll work hard to prove my love.
And I'm ready for it.
And if you lose, you'll forget my sister.
And leave this village forever.
Afzal!
I'll wake you up at five in the morning.
Get that?
Useless fellow.
Hi, mate.
New roomie.
Better.
I slept pretty late at night.
It was stinking.
How about some tea?
- No. Cappuccino.
There's your cappuccino.
So how was the cappuccino?
Here.
Go, clean the stable.
"What has love.."
- Excuse me, ma'am.
"...reduced me to?"
Dirty fellows.
- "My heart cries.."
"Someone tell me, what the future holds."
Hurry up!
"What has love reduced me to?"
- What a shitty smell.
"My heart cries.. Someone
tell me, what the future holds."
So much work, man!
Aren't you done yet?
Oh, no!
Greetings, holy cow!
Wrong button.
Go. Go.
Where's my tractor?
Tractor?
Stop.
Oh my God!
You crazy bulls.
Stop.
Oh my God!
Sir, look at this foreign farmer.
He won't last a day.
He wants a tractor.
Oh, mom...
Here. Eat it.
Colorful.
Water.
- Come on. Take it.
Water.
Listen. Catch the early train tomorrow and leave.
There isn't any need to tolerate all this.
"I feel so alive."
"I love you more than I can say."
Will I get the same thing to eat tomorrow?
Yes.
So, are you taking the morning train back?
Not in your dreams.
Out!
I'm putting you on a diet from tomorrow.
Go on.
"My heart goes.."
Come on, baby.
- "My heart goes.."
Let's do some farming today.
At first he said that he'll discuss the marriage proposal
when his sister returns.
I guess, now he'll want this boy to leave first.
Why don't you ask?
- What's there to ask?
That boy's toiling hard for his love.
He'll win the bet and throw you two out of the game.
Let it be.
Excuse me.
Where does Raghuveer stay?
And you are from?
- Australia.
Anybody home?
- Who is it?
She's the girl.
So, you're the one who has hooked the gold fish.
I am his dad.
What are you staring at?
Go.
Call your brother.
Who is it, Sona?
So, you're Raghuveer.
- Yes.
Do you know who I am?
I am Ram's dad.
So, you have come here to take him back.
No, I'm here to greet you.
Offer you sweets.
- How rude.
Is this how you welcome guests?
He's not getting his due respect here because of you two.
I don't want to be your guest of honor.
Anyway, do you know what it means?
You made my son toil like peasants.
Do you know who he is?
- Tell him.
His dad is one of the top 500 billionaires of Australia.
So?
- Wait and watch, I'm going to take him away!
So, take him away.
Why did you keep him here for so long?
We won't spare you.
- Hey!
Mind it.
That day, I didn't say a word because that was your house.
But this is my house.
If you try to raise your voice...
What can you do?
What can you do?
Are you threatening us?
We can bribe the police to get you arrested.
Yes.
- You need money for that.
But I can kill you two right now.
Will you kill me?
You will kill me!
Kill me.
Let's see. Kill me.
Dad.
What have you done to yourself?
Why did you come here, dad?
Ram. He has come all the way from Australia.
And you're asking him why.
Your condition's making me cry...
Quiet.
Let me talk to my son.
Leave us alone.
What's wrong with you, Ram?
What are you doing?
You're ruining your future for a girl.
Come. Let's go back to Australia.
Sorry, dad.
Am I not your close friend?
If you were my friend, you would help me.
Well said, Ram.
You?
Why didn't you go with them?
Like only son, like only friend.
Being your dad, can I ask you something?
What if you lose?
How could you ever think that?
First answer my question.
What if you lose?
- What if you fall in the well?
See, I have support.
I won't fall.
I have the support of my love.
I won't lose either.
Love has made you crazy.
Did I ever say that money has made you crazy?
What a thought!
Did you get that?
- No, I didn't.
That's why I asked...
What was the thought?
Everyone's acting wise here except me.
Here, eat it.
Idiot. What's he doing?
I don't get it.
Do you call this a life?
God gifts every individual with a fate.
You have everything.
So have fun.
Once it's gone, you'll never get it back.
Does he understand?
Is he listening?
I think he's listening.
Bijli.
Some people work hard all day and make loads of money.
And consider themselves fortunate.
But they don't know
that the greatest wealth is love.
And by the time they realize that
it's too late.
Love. Bloody nonsense.
You think, this is the power of your love.
You think I can't do this.
Can't I eat this?
This? You want me to eat this?
Water? Yes.
- Water!
Water! Water! Water!
Quickly. Water!
Water! Water!
There's no water in the car.
Water! Water!
How can you eat this?
It can kill anyone.
You're not used to eating this.
Can you endure anything for your love?
Does love really give you all this strength?
If it wasn't for love, I wouldn't have come here.
Neither would you have come for me.
Pardon me.
I'm not rich like you.
I'm just a station master.
It hurts you to see your son eat this crap.
But she eats this too.
If Ram sleeps on the floor
then so does she.
You must be thinking that these are old rustic values.
That's true.
But that's how she is.
And every day, she prays in the temple for his victory.
Don't ever let that lamp extinguish, dear.
My son has led a life of luxury and comfort.
He has never done anything all his life.
Seeing him toil here made me go crazy.
Your love has shown me and my son
the value of this soil.
God bless you.
God bless you, dear.
Your decision's wrong, brother-in-law.
My sister will never agree.
In fact, it can create problems between you two.
Yes.
It can make things worse.
I don't want any problem
between the two of you because of me.
- Yes.
- Don't worry.
I know my wife's weaknesses.
She always listens to useless
and good-for-nothing people.
I'm returning home today.
I know how to make my wife understand.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse me.
I tried my best.
- Take a look.
Take a look at my daughter's condition.
What's going to happen to her now?
Stop it, JP. Stop it.
My sister won't agree so easily.
Look. Your only concern is
that Ram might marry that girl.
But he'll have to win the challenge for that.
Yes. And Raghuveer doesn't want Ram to win.
Ram will definitely lose.
Say that again.
Ram will definitely lose! 100%.
"My dormant life.."
"My dormant life.."
"Has found wings after meeting you."
"After meeting you."
"My dormant life.."
"Has found wings.."
"Has found wings"
"after meeting you."
"It's the influence of your love."
"My heart now dwells in you."
"God's blessed me with His grace since we met."
"Since we met, I've found myself."
"Since I was braced.."
"Since I was braced.."
"Braced by the color of love."
There are crops in everyone's fields.
But nothing in mine.
Ram.
Yeah! There are crops in my field too.
"Look at the sky melting away."
"Conveys through the droplets."
"My love."
"My unbound love."
"Who cares about the world"
"when the heart has crossed all boundaries?"
"My world seems so new."
"You've renewed me."
"Since I was braced.."
"Braced by the color of love."
"The color of love's so strong."
"It has touched my soul."
"Can't seem to get rid of it."
Please. Give that back.
"Can't seem to get rid of it."
- Just a minute.
"It's become an unforgettable promise."
"An unbreakable bond of the heart."
"Since I was braced.."
"Braced by the color of love."
"Since I was braced.."
"Since I was braced.."
"Braced by the color of love."
"Since I was braced.."
"Since I was braced.."
Hello.
- The situation's getting worse.
That girl won't let go of Ram easily.
I think we'll lose Ram.
I am holding on to your promise.
I always keep my promise.
The same will happen this time too.
What do I do now?
No need to tell me what you'll do.
But she shouldn't become my daughter-in-law.
Just wait and watch now.
They won't know what hit them.
Who are you?
It's me.
- You.
What are you doing here?
- Making a canal.
Canal? Why?
To save the fields from the rain.
It won't rain. Just leave.
I think it's going to rain.
You fool.
I've been farming here for years.
And you're going to teach me about rain.
These are just storm clouds.
It's not going to rain...
Afzal!
- Don't worry, sir.
I already made a canal in your field.
You're getting drenched.
I'll handle things here.
Raghu!
Raghu! Raghu!
Why are you sleeping here?
What's wrong?
- I was missing mom.
Sir, I was thinking...
- Stop thinking.
I have good news for you.
Sona has scored first class marks in her exams.
Yes, first class.
Sona.
Take sir's blessings.
Always be successful.
Marry the one you love.
And lead a happy life.
I didn't say that deliberately.
It just slipped out.
What are you looking at?
I would've gifted Sona the railway station
if she had been my daughter.
What are you giving her?
Go ahead, Sona.
Ask for anything you want.
Bangles. Earrings.
Go ahead.
Go.
Ask away, Sona.
What do you want?
Can we arrange a feast for the villagers?
Of course, invite everyone.
Brother.
Ram is in the village too.
Can he attend as well?
Fine. Since we're inviting
everyone, invite him too.
He has agreed but only after hesitating.
But careful.
Your brother's coming.
Can I get two more?
Just two?
Someone, tie the bull.
He's overeaten.
You're mistaken.
That was me belching, not that bull.
You're mistaken too.
He meant you, not the bull.
Quiet.
Don't act smart.
And careful...
Thank you.
- What for?
You invited the entire village
so that I get to eat good food.
The other day, I ate that spicy food
and you gave me a bonus.
Today, you've excelled in your exams
and all I get is food?
No bonus?
Friends, on the occasion of Sona's achievement
everyone will get a bonus from me.
A box of sweets each.
I've realized how much you love Sona.
No one can love her more than you.
Sona.
Sona. Come quickly.
Let go.
Sir!
Let go of me.
Get lost.
Hello.
My name is Rao.
People are terrified of me.
I know.
Who is the target?
He's the right man.
Straight to the point.
Keep this.
I'll tell you the job later.
I'll destroy the entire crop.
Mix it.
Mix it. Mix it.
Boss. This is a new fertilizer.
One liter will turn the fields lush green.
And two liters will make it barren like a desert.
Add three.
- Fine, boss.
Look, boss.
- Pour it.
Let's go.
Run. Quickly.
Who is that?
Boss.
- Yes.
I don't know.
Double action.
Same to same.
What's he doing?
What's wrong with you all?
Why is everyone making a ruckus?
Oh, God!
Fire! Fire! Fire!
Fire! Fire!
Fire! Fire!
Sir, fire.
Afzal.
- Sir, fire!
Come to your senses.
Throw water. Quickly!
Come on.
Careful.
Hurry up.
Move.
Ram!
No, Sona.
No, Sona.
- Ram...
Sona. Stop.
Ram.
- Stop, I...
Are you crazy?
What if something had happened to you?
What?
What's in the box?
"I feel so alive."
"I love you more than I can say."
Brilliant!
You did the right thing.
Destroyed everything completely.
What are you thinking now?
Who was that guy in glasses, I saw in the fields?
Keep thinking.
I'll find someone else to do my job.
Your idea to ruin the crops was wrong.
Give me another chance.
If I fail this time you can...
Clobber me with your shoe.
I have a plan.
- You do?
Then it must be good.
Go ahead. Do it.
Sona.
Sona.
The crops will be harvested tomorrow.
That will decide our future.
Are you worried?
I feel something-something too.
In my excitement, I told him,
I'll grow more crops than him.
I was a little overconfident, right?
A bit.
Your brother's a nice man.
Ask him not to throw me out if I fail.
I'll work like a peasant.
I cannot leave this village.
The cattle.
The fields.
Your brother's glare.
I can't live without these things anymore.
I never imagined this but I'm used to it now.
This is Ram's pile.
Let's move some of it
to Raghuveer's pile.
Then Ram cannot win.
Boss, you're intelligent like a genius!
Are you buttering me?
Get to work.
Fool.
These bloody mosquitoes...
I forgot
to feed the cows again.
Boss, you burnt your back the other day.
Today, you got peed on.
What's happening with you, boss?
Did you finish the job?
Yes, I'm done.
- Was that a joke?
Get back to work.
You are so dead, Ram.
Why is everyone rushing there?
Shouldn't we be in a hurry instead?
Everyone wants the boy to win.
Let's go and take a look.
One!
Three!
Five!
What are you doing here?
Praying for your victory?
The offering in Ram's name is done.
Ram?
- Here's the coconut.
I'm really happy.
I don't know whether he'll win or not.
But he has definitely won your heart.
No.
He'll have to win the bet too.
You're still adamant.
If he loses, won't you get them married?
He won't lose.
He put his life at stake for my sister's toy.
My mom will never forgive me if he loses.
I saw his pile in the morning.
It seemed a bit less.
So, I added some of my harvest to his pile.
When you were a kid, I bet on your honesty.
Today I won.
Break the coconut.
We won, Sona!
We won.
- Rascal. Come on.
How will I face my daughter now?
What will I say to Ram's mom?
Your stupid plan has ruined me.
Now... I'll finish this job.
You handle the police.
Sona!
We won, Sona!
I managed to grow more crops!
Two sacks!
Get in! Get in!
Ram!
Bro...
Ram!
Ram!
Sir...
Sona.
Go on.
I proposed for your marriage with my son.
But your brother never replied.
Now, I will get this wedding done.
Come on, son.
Tie the nuptial necklace.
We'll see how she doesn't marry you.
Get lost!
If you marry her, her brother will kill you.
He can't.
He can never come here.
- Why not?
I came here, right?
He'll come too.
Look.
Look, he's here.
Sona, run.
Catch her.
Come on, Sona.
This way. Come on.
That way. Go that way.
Here.. Sit here.
Don't make a sound.
Stop.
There she is.
Where is she?
Where is she hiding?
Tell me.
- Sir!
You dare spit on me!
Stop!
- No!
Leave me!
Faster.
Run over them.
Run over both of them.
No...
Sorry! Sorry!
Brother.
Hold him!
I will...
Brother!
Brother!
- Hey!
So, you took the blame upon yourself.
Your sister is fortunate to have a brother like you.
A new dawn awaits you.
Get some sleep.
You're lucky to have a sister like Sona.
They didn't get married
as there wasn't any auspicious day.
There can't be a better day than the day of your release.
I didn't ask her to come.
Ashwini came here willingly.
"I feel so alive."
"I love you more than I can say."
"It's just me, my heart and you."
"So, why feel shy?"
"I never saw anyone like you."
"Where were you all my life?"
"I feel so alive."
"I love you more than I can say."
"Whenever you are close"
"I want that moment to freeze."
"I wish time stops whenever we're close."
"I wish time stops whenever we're close."
"I feel so full of breath."
"My heart skips a beat more often."
"My heart searches for you whenever it's lonely."
"Thinks about you every moment."
"My heart searches for you whenever it's lonely."
"Thinks about you every moment."
"My heart searches for you whenever it's lonely."
"Thinks about you every moment."
"Our hearts reach out to each other."
"I feel deeply in love with you."
