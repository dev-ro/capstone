2 YEARS AGO, I RESERVED
THIS SPECIFIC AREA.
HOW ABOUT
IF I SAY PLEASE?
THAT'S
THE ONE EXCEPTION.
OH!
CAREFUL THERE.
DID YOU FIND
SWITZERLAND?
UM...
I DID, YEAH.
AND I CLAIMED IT
FOR MISSOURI.
YOU KNOW, I PLANTED
MY LITTLE FLAG
AND SOLD BEADS
TO THE NATIVES.
THEY HAD SANDWICHES
THERE.
I BROUGHT YOU SOME.
OH...
I'M ANN...
COLLINS.
[WITH FOREIGN ACCENT]
OH, SURE. THE LADY WHO
DISCOVERED SWITZERLAND.
IN ALL THE PAPERS.
I'M CHRIS NIELSEN.

LET'S MAKE OUT.
[CHUCKLES]
[ALL GIGGLING]
Ian: I TELL YOU...
COME ON. YOU'VE
GOT TO EAT
SOMETHING.
NO, I DON'T. I CAN
GET SOMETHING AT SCHOOL.
YEAH, AND I KNOW
WHAT YOU'LL GET.
WELL, MOM,
I GOT TO CARB UP.
I GOT A GAME.
AND A MATH TEST.
YEAH, YEAH.
I'M READY.
I'M COOL.
Girl: MOM, IF YOU PICK
ME UP, I WON'T HAVE
TO WAIT A MILLION HOURS
AT HIS INCREDIBLY
BORING GAMES.
Annie: I'M SORRY, MARIE.
I HAVE A MEETING,
AND ANGIE'S GOING
TO SWING BY AND
PICK YOU UP
BEFORE SHE GETS
YOUR BROTHER.
I'LL LET HER TAKE
THE VAN...
AND I'LL SEE YOU
AT CORA'S THING TOMORROW.
I THOUGHT
YOU COULDN'T.
I'LL WORK IT OUT.
I DON'T WANT TO MISS IT.
Woman: WE'RE LATE, GUYS.
I'LL PULL OUT THE VAN.
OK.
HEY, ACE IT, OK?
YEAH.
LOVE YOU.
[KISS]
WHAT?
YOU WANT
HIS BREAKFAST?
NO.
YOUR MOTHER PUTS
HEALTHY STUFF IN THERE,
SO DON'T TRADE IT--
FOR POTATO CHIPS
AND COOKIES. I KNOW.
HEY.
Chris, voice-over:
IT WAS THE LAST TIME ANNIE
AND I SAW THEM ALIVE.
Reverend: WHEN DEATH CLAIMS
THE LIFE OF OUR CHILDREN,
WE ARE LEFT
WITH TOO MANY QUESTIONS.
HOW DO WE MAKE SENSE
OF THE FEELINGS WE'RE LEFT WITH?
THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE,
EVEN THE 1 CORINTHIANS,
TELL US OF
THE EXTRAORDINARY PARADISE
THAT AWAITS US.
[CHILDREN GIGGLING]
Chris: OK.
THE LUCKY WINNER IS...
JACOBS,
STACEY JACOBS.
[AS ELMER FUDD]
HELLO, STACEY.
I'M DR. NIELSEN.
HI.
OH, TOO LATE.
OH...
NICE STREAM.
I BET HE FEELS
A LOT BETTER.
HE'S BEEN WANTING
TO DO THAT
FOR 10 YEARS.
STACEY JACOBS!
WHAT IN
THE WORLD WERE
YOU THINKING?
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
MY KID USED TO SAY,
"HEY, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
YOU WEREN'T LOOKING ANYWAY."
DO YOU LIKE RABBITS?
YES?
THEN GO LIKE THIS.
GOOD.
READY?
SEE THAT GUY?
WHOA!
Woman: WE'VE GIVEN
HER MRIs AND--
WHOA!
WILD RABBIT.
WATCH OUT.
UH! OH!
AND ALSO A CAT SCAN,
I BELIEVE.
WELL,
LOOK AT THAT.
STACEY, YOU HAVE
MORE PICTURES
THAN A SUPERMODEL.
DO YOU EVER
WEAR GLASSES?
NO, NO. SHE DOESN'T
NEED GLASSES.
DOES YOUR HEAD
HURT A LOT?
ALL THE TIME.
I WANT YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME.
I WANT YOU
TO CUP YOUR HAND
AND COVER YOUR NOSE
AND YOUR MOUTH LIKE THIS
AND JUST BREATHE
IN AND OUT.
Woman, over intercom:
MRS. NIELSEN ON 4.
OH, IT'S MY WIFE.
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN DO THAT
LONGER THAN SHE CAN TALK.
THAT WILL BE
A REAL ACHIEVEMENT.
Annie: CHRISTY...
I'VE GOT A MELTDOWN.
OK. TAKE A BREATH.
THE 8 PIECES FROM GERMANY
NEVER ARRIVED.
I'VE GOT TO CHOOSE
REPLACEMENTS THE NIGHT
BEFORE THE OPENING
AND GET THEM DOWN HERE
AND REHANG THEM AND
RELIGHT THEM, AND I...
OK. FOCUS, OK?
FOCUS.
IT'S OUR DOUBLE-D
ANNIVERSARY, AND
I'M RUINING EVERYTHING.
DOUBLE-D. YEAH.
I'M SORRY, CHRISTY.
I CAN'T LEAVE HERE.
I'M SORRY.
Chris: OK.
UM...TELL YOU WHAT.
HOW ABOUT THIS?
UH...
HOW ABOUT
THE HUDSON RIVERS?
OK?
THAT GIVES US THREE.
AND THE, UH,
THE HOLLENBECK...
AND THE, UH, HANNOCK 16,
19, AND, UH...
23, THE ONE
OF THE BRIDGE.
BUT THEY'RE
ALL THE WAY
OUT IN FAIRFIELD,
AND I DON'T HAVE
ANYBODY TO SEND.
I'LL DROP BY
AFTER WORK.
I'LL PICK THEM UP
AND TAKE THEM OVER
TO THE GALLERY, HUH?
YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?
ONLY IF YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL.
HEY...THAT GIVES US
A CHANCE TO SHOW YOURS.
OH, YOU'VE GOT TO
HANG IT. IT'S VERY SEXY.
HA HA HA!
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
OK, WEIRDO.
I'LL BE HOME LATE,
BUT I'LL BE HOME.
I LOVE YOU, BELLA.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
BYE.
YEAH.
STACEY,
DO YOU LIKE ART?
MY WIFE FIXES PAINTINGS,
AND SHE ALSO MAKES
SOME OF HER OWN.
YOU KNOW, TO ME,
PAINTINGS ARE THE MOST
IMPORTANT, INTERESTING
THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD,
NEXT TO YOUR BRAIN.
YOU FEEL BETTER,
DON'T YOU?
HMM. MIGRAINES.
Chris, voice-over:
I SAID "I LOVE YOU, BELLA."
I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT.
AT LEAST I GOT
TO SAY IT.
[HORN HONKING]
[ENGINE REVVING]
[HORN HONKING]
[TIRES SQUEALING]
[CRASHING]
[TIRES SQUEALING]
UH!
[HORN HONKS]
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
Woman:
YES, I THINK SO.
I'M A DOCTOR.
GET ME
OUT OF HERE.
DON'T MOVE.
[POLICE RADIO TRANSMISSIONS]
[VOICES SOUND FAR AWAY]
ALL RIGHT,
HE'S GETTING
HIS OWN.
Man: CHRIS...
Chris: HMM?
Man: DO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENED?
Chris: YEAH, I HAD
A BAD PIECE OF FISH BEFORE BED.
WHO ARE YOU?
DOC...
ARE YOU OPERATING
ON ME?
WHO ARE YOU?
[SLOW BEEPING]
WHY CAN'T I SEE YOU?
[BEEPING SPEEDS UP,
THEN STOPS]
[DOG BARKING]
Chris: GINGER!
GINGER, YOU SEE ME!
Doc: HMM. SHE DOES.
DOGS ARE DIFFERENT.
CAN YOU SEE ME NOW?
Chris: IS THAT YOU, DOC?
WHY ARE YOU SO BLURRED?
Doc: I'LL GET CLEAR
WHEN YOU WANT ME TO, CHRIS.
ARE YOU CONFUSED ABOUT
HOW YOU GOT HOME SO FAST?
Chris: DREAMS DON'T DEAL
IN TIME, DOC.
TIME DOESN'T COUNT.
[SNIFFLING]
YOU'VE DIED, CHRIS.
Chris: YOU HAVE TO BE
A DREAM, DOC.
IF I WERE DEAD,
WOULD I NEED YOU TO TELL ME?
Doc: I GUESS YOU DO.
EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT.
I WISH EVERYBODY
WOULD GO HOME.
I KNOW.
Chris: HOW COME I SEE
EVERYONE, DOC? EVERYBODY--
Doc: I'M THE ONE
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE.
YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE DEAD.
Annie: THE KIDS--THE KIDS
WERE SO YOUNG AT THAT TIME.
Doc: WHAT YOU WANT TO REMEMBER
IS YOUR KIDS...
WHEN THEY WERE STILL ALIVE.
WHEN SHE GOES
TO THE HOSPITAL,
I'M GOING, TOO.
MARIE...
KATIE'S NOT--
KATIE'S NOT GOING THERE
TO GET BETTER.
SUGAR?
THEY'RE GOING
TO GIVE HER A SHOT,
AND IT'S NOT GOING
TO HURT, AND SHE'S
GOING TO FALL ASLEEP.
YOU'RE GOING
TO KILL MY DOG?
I'M GOING TO
HELP HER DIE, YES.
HONEY, SHE...
SHE HURTS VER--
VERY BADLY,
AND NOTHING
CAN HELP HER,
SO I'M GOING TO
STOP THAT BECAUSE...
I LOVE HER.
YOU'RE GOING
TO KILL MY DOG.
YOU GET ANGRY.
DEATH DOES THAT.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO HER?
[EXHALES LOUDLY]
UM...SHE'LL GO
WHERE WE ALL GO...
AND HOW CAN THAT BE BAD?
[GIGGLING]
Ian: COME ON, DAD!
Chris:
OH, MY LEG! OH! OH!
AH, SUCKER!
HA HA!
[CHRIS BREATHING HEAVILY]
Ian: HEY, THANKS FOR
NOT LISTENING TO MOM.
ABOUT WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW, JUST
COMING OUT HERE,
THIS WHOLE DAY.
YOU KNOW, SHE DIDN'T
WANT US DOING THIS
BECAUSE OF,
I DON'T KNOW,
GRADES AND STUFF.
YOUR MOTHER
AND I DID TALK.
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
WE ALWAYS LISTEN
TO EACH OTHER.
SO, I MEAN, WHAT
DID YOU TALK ABOUT?
ABOUT TAKING YOU
OUT OF HEAD-ROYCE.
THE SCHOOL'S WRONG
FOR YOU.
Reverend: WHILE THIS
IS A TIME...
Chris: WHERE ARE WE NOW?
Doc: MAYBE YOU WON'T WANT
TO STAY, CHRIS.
THIS IS YOUR FUNERAL.
OHH...
WHAT AM I ON? YOU'RE
REAL, REAL FUZZY.
[REVEREND SPEAKING SOFTLY]
Doc: AT LEAST YOU'RE
WILLING TO SEE YOURSELF.
ARE YOU LOSING
YOUR FEAR?
FEAR?
THAT
YOU DISAPPEARED.
YOU DIDN'T.
YOU ONLY DIED.
Reverend: A WOMAN,
WHO LOST HER ONLY CHILDREN
JUST 4 SHORT YEARS AGO,
EVERY DAY
IN THE LORD'S PRAYER...
CELIA.
HO HO! COME ON.
WHOA.
Reverend:
SUDDENLY, ONE DAY,
WE KNOW THE FEELING
OF THAT.
A TIME WHEN MEANING
OF FAITH, HOPE...
[REVEREND SPEAKING SOFTLY]
...IS PUT TO
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME TEST.
SHH, SHH, SHH.
HEY...
THIS ONE'S A PRESENT...
FOR ME.
IT'S OUR
DOUBLE-D ANNIVERSARY.
IT'S KIND OF
OUR SPECIAL DAY.
IT'S HER VERSION
OF OUR PLACE.
 YOUR PLACE?
WHERE WE FIRST MET.
WHERE WE WERE GOING
TO RETIRE, I GUESS,
LIVE OUT OUR LIVES...
BE OLD FARTS TOGETHER.
RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S
OUR DREAM HOUSE.
THAT ONE'S ME,
I GUESS.
[CHUCKLES]
THE BLURRY ONE'S
ANNIE.
HMM, LOOKS A LITTLE
FAMILIAR, DOC.
HUH?
[CHUCKLES]
THE FUNERAL'S OVER,
DOC.
WHY IS THIS GOING ON
PAST THE FUNERAL?
Annie, voice-over:
DEAR DIARY...
I'M WRITING
IN YOUR BULLSHIT PAGES
BECAUSE MY SHRINK
IS CRAZIER THAN I AM.
HE THINKS YOU'RE THERAPY.
HE FIGURES IF 2 BABIES CAN
HAMMER ME INTO A PSYCHO WARD,
WHAT WILL I DO WITH THIS?
HE'S SO STUPID.
HE'S SO STUPID, HE THINKS HE
PULLED ME THROUGH THE BREAKDOWN
WHEN IT WAS ONLY CHRISTY,
ALWAYS, ONLY CHRIS.
JESUS.
I WAS LOOKING THROUGH
HIS POSTCARDS.
PAINTINGS
WERE HIS OBSESSION.
HE USED ART AS
ANOTHER WAY TO LOVE ME,
TO HELP ME,
TO KEEP US
ALWAYS TOGETHER.
ANNIE...
I'M HERE, BABE.
I STILL EXIST.
YOU'RE THINKING OF ME.
KEEP THINKING OF ME.
COME ON. WITH ME.
YOU'RE ALWAYS WITH ME.
OTHER PEOPLE FINISH
EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES.
REMEMBER US?
I STILL EXIST.
I STILL EXIST.
[WHISPERING]
I still exist.
JUST WRITE IT DOWN.
WRITE IT DOWN.
THIS IS CHRIS.
THIS...
IS CHRIS.
I...
STILL...
EXIST.
READ IT.
READ IT.
[SOBBING]
[SOBBING]
Chris: CHRIST,
WHEN DOES IT END?
Doc: THERE'S NO RULES,
CHRIS.
IT ENDS WHEN
YOU WANT IT TO.
WHERE WERE YOU?
SOMEPLACE ELSE.
HMM...
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I'M A FIGMENT OF
YOUR IMAGINATION?
IT'S REAL.
 SHE'S REAL.
 YOU'RE REAL.
IT'S ALL REAL.
THAT'S THE POINT.
THERE IS A POINT.
REALITY IS IT'S OVER
WHEN YOU STOP WANTING
TO HURT HER.
"FOREVER."
[ANNIE MOANS SOFTLY]
DON'T WORRY, BABY.
I'M NOT
LEAVING YOU ALONE.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
AAH!
AAH!
[LOUD SOBBING]
GOOD-BYE, BABE.
UH...
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
[CRIES SOFTLY]
[RUSTLING]
[BARKING]
OH! KATIE!
IT'S YOU! HA HA!
YOU'RE YOUNG AGAIN! OH!
OH, KATIE!
COME HERE, KATIE!
HA HA HA! KATIE!
OH, KATIE.
KATIE!
[KATIE BARKING]
COME ON, KATIE!
COME ON!
Chris:
BOY, I SCREWED UP.
I'M IN DOG HEAVEN.
A PLACE WHERE WE ALL GO
CAN'T BE BAD, CAN IT, GIRL?
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
MAYBE I'M NOT IN YOUR HEAVEN
AFTER ALL, GIRL.
MAYBE YOU'RE IN MINE!
[KATIE BARKING]
ANNIE!
Man: CHRIS! WHAT
THE HELL YOU DOING?
THAT AIN'T HOW YOU USE
A STETHOSCOPE!
ALBERT LEWIS?
LAST TIME YOU SAW ME,
I WAS 63, STRETCHED OUT
ON A CARDIAC WARD.
HA HA! I BET YOU THOUGHT
I'D BE OLD AND DECREPIT,
HUH?
TALKING ABOUT,
"OH, CAN'T GO ON!
CAN'T GO ON!"
WHO WANTS TO BE 63
THROUGHOUT ETERNITY?
LOOK AT YOU
ON THE WATER THERE.
WELL,
HELLO, SOMEBODY!
COME ON! WALK ALONG!
FEEL THE BREEZE!
DANCING ON WATER,
SMOOTH AS EVER!
HA HA HA!
AND THAT WAS YOU...
JUST NOW WHEN...
WHEN I DIED.
I THOUGHT YOU
RECOGNIZED ME BEFORE
BECAUSE YOU KEPT
CALLING ME DOC,
ME BEING
YOUR FAVORITE DOC
OF ALL TIME.
COULD YOU LEND ME
A HAND HERE?
I'M KIND OF UP TO MY ASS
IN PROBLEMS AGAIN, CHIEF.
OH, HO HO, CHRIS.
UH!
COME HERE.
YOU ARE STILL
KIND OF UGLY.
YOU TAUGHT ME
A LOT, CHIEF.
NICE PLACE
YOU GOT HERE.
OH, NO, NO, NO.
NICE PLACE
 YOU GOT HERE.
ME?
SURE. YOU'RE MAKING
ALL OF THIS.
SEE, WE'RE ALL
PRETTY INSECURE
AT FIRST,
SO WE SEE OURSELVES
SOMEWHERE SAFE,
COMFORTING.
WE ALL PAINT OUR OWN
SURROUNDINGS, CHRIS,
BUT YOU'RE
THE FIRST GUY I KNOW
TO USE REAL PAINT!
THERE'S SO MUCH HERE
SHE DIDN'T PAINT...
LIKE THAT BIRD.
ANNIE GAVE YOU
A START,
SORT OF LIKE HOLDING
ON TO HANDRAILS.
NOW YOU'RE CREATING
AN ENTIRE WORLD HERE
FROM YOUR
IMAGINATION, FROM
PAINTINGS YOU LOVE,
ANYTHING YOU WANT!
WHY DOESN'T IT MOVE?
IT'LL MOVE
WHEN YOU WANT IT TO.
HA HA!
YOU GO, BOY!
CAN I MAKE IT DIVE?
YOU'RE
THE PAINTER NOW.
IT'S YOUR WORLD!
EEEE-AHA!
WHOO! HA HA HA!
LOOK AT IT GO!
WHOO!
HOW ABOUT MAYBE
TURQUOISE WINGS?
TURQUOISE!
IN THE HOUSE!
AND A LITTLE MAUVE!
ALL RIGHT!
WHOO!
WHOA!
HUH!
I DIDN'T DO THAT.
NO, I DID.
SEE, WHEN WE'RE
TOGETHER, IT'S,
LIKE, DUAL CONTROLS.
CAN I MAKE
ELEPHANTS FLY?
HEY, DIDN'T ANNIE
PAINT YOU GUYS
A HOUSE SOMEWHERE?
YEAH.
IT'S OUR DREAM HOUSE.
JUST A STROLL
ACROSS THE WATER.
LET'S TAKE
THE SHORTCUT.
NICE SHORTCUT.
IT'S EASY, CHRIS!
LOOK AT ME!
I'M GOING TO DROWN.
YOU CAN'T.
YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD.
OH.
AM I--AM I REALLY HERE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "YOU," ANYWAY?
ARE YOU YOUR ARM
OR YOUR LEG?
HARDLY.
REALLY?
IF YOU LOST ALL YOUR LIMBS,
WOULDN'T YOU STILL BE YOU?
I'D STILL BE ME.
SO WHAT IS THE "ME"?
MY BRAIN, I SUPPOSE.
YOUR BRAIN.
YOUR BRAIN
IS A BODY PART,
LIKE YOUR FINGERNAIL
OR YOUR HEART.
WHY IS THAT
THE PART THAT'S YOU?
BECAUSE I...
HAVE SORT OF A VOICE
IN MY HEAD,
THE PART OF ME
THAT THINKS, THAT FEELS,
THAT IS AWARE
THAT I EXIST AT ALL.
SO IF YOU'RE AWARE
YOU EXIST,
THEN YOU DO.
THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE STILL HERE.
[KATIE BARKING]
HA HA HA!
Albert: NO WINDOWS.
WHAT AREN'T YOU READY
TO SEE, I WONDER?
DRINK UP.
JUST THINK
IT'S COFFEE,
AND IT WILL BE.
AHH...OK.
IT'S COFFEE.
PAINT...ACRYLIC.
[CHUCKLES]
WHY IS THIS
SO HARD?
LOOK...
YOUR BRAIN IS MEAT
AND ROTS AND DISAPPEARS.
DID YOU REALLY
THINK THAT'S ALL
THERE WAS TO YOU?
LIKE, YOU'RE
IN YOUR HOUSE
RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE
 IN YOUR HOUSE.
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU ARE YOUR HOUSE.
HOUSE FALLS DOWN,
YOU GET OUT
AND WALK AWAY.
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
I REBUILT, HUH?
YOU SEE A BODY
BECAUSE YOU LIKE
SEEING ONE.
WE'RE SEEING WHAT
WE CHOOSE TO SEE.
LET ME SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.
HA!
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
Chris: IT'S REAL.
WHERE'S ALL THE PAINT?
YOU DON'T NEED IT
ANYMORE.
THIS IS
YOUR WORLD NOW.
HA HA HA!
THOUGHT IS REAL.
PHYSICAL
IS THE ILLUSION.
IRONIC, HUH?
WHERE'S GOD
IN ALL THIS?
OH, HE'S UP THERE...
SOMEWHERE, SHOUTING
DOWN THAT HE LOVES US,
WONDERING WHY
WE CAN'T HEAR HIM.
YOU THINK?
HMM.
DRINK YOUR COFFEE.
NEEDS MILK.
DON'T PUSH
YOUR LUCK.
[CHUCKLES]
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
Annie:
WHAT DO YOU THINK, CHRISTY?
RIGHT HERE...
LIKE THIS?
YOU THINK?
THEY SAY WE LIVE
IN OUR MINDS ANYWAY.
HAVING YOU WITH ME
LIKE THIS
KEEPS ME HAPPY.
WHY DO I BELIEVE
YOU CAN HEAR ME?
WHY DO I THINK
YOU CAN SEE THIS?
Chris: WHAT'S
THAT PURPLE TREE?
I NEVER SAW THAT.
WELL,
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
THINK YOU CAN GET
THERE IN 8 SECONDS?
OOH, 8 SECONDS.
HA HA! OVER THERE.
YEAH. I'LL JUST NEED
A LITTLE INCENTIVE.
UH!
YEAH...
I CAN FLY.
WHOA, WHOA!
WHY NOT? I CAN DO
WHAT I WANT, RIGHT?
WELL, I THINK YOU'D
BE MORE COMFORTABLE
KEEPING IT REAL.
YEAH?
THINK OF RUNNING
REAL FAST LIKE
THE ROADRUNNER, OK?
YEAH.
[CHUCKLES]
I CAN HANDLE THIS.
OK.
 ADIOS, MUCHACHO.
HA HA HA!
Albert: OH, WAIT!
CHRIS!
ANNIE!
I BET YOU'RE THINKING,
"OH, SHIT!" NOW.
AAH!
AAH!
AH!
HA HA HA!
YEAH!
GO, BOY!
AAAAGH!
WHOO!
AAAAH!
GO, CHRIS, GO!
UH!
HA HA HA!
OHH...
ALBERT!
ALBERT!
IT'S COMPLETELY NEW.
THAT CANVAS
WAS BLANK
WHEN I WAS ALIVE.
HOW CAN I
SEE THIS DRAWING
AFTER I'M DEAD?
HUH! FOR AN EXPERT,
YOU LOOK PRETTY SURPRISED.
Albert: YOU AND ANNIE
A LONG COURTSHIP?
NO, ACTUALLY.
FROM THE VERY
FIRST MOMENT,
IT WAS LIKE--
SOUL MATES.
IT'S EXTREMELY RARE,
BUT IT EXISTS.
SORT OF LIKE
TWIN SOULS TUNED
INTO EACH OTHER...
APPARENTLY,
EVEN IN DEATH.
YOU'RE REACHING
EACH OTHER THROUGH
HER PAINTING.
IT'S--IT'S NOTHING
I'VE EVER SEEN,
CHRIS.
Annie: YOU CAN'T SEE IT,
CAN YOU?
AND YOU NEVER WILL.
[SIGHS]
I LOVE YOU!
UGH...
[KATIE BARKING]
WHOSE FOOTPRINTS
ARE THESE?
DON'T ASK ME.
YOU PUT THEM HERE.
[BIRD SQUAWKS LOUDLY]
ANNIE...
ANNIE!
CHRIS, ANNIE!
FANTASIES AREN'T
WHAT YOU NEED
RIGHT NOW, CHRIS.
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I NEED ANNIE.
THAT WILL CHANGE
IN TIME, CHRIS.
OH, COME ON,
EINSTEIN!
TIME'S NOT SOMETHING
ON MY WATCH ANYMORE!
TIME DOES NOT
EXIST HERE...
AND WHEREVER IT WENT,
IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE ME
NEED ANNIE ANY LESS.
YOU'LL FEEL
DIFFERENTLY, CHRIS,
AND SO WILL SHE!
MAN...
YOU DON'T KNOW US.
WISH I DID.
MARIE...
MARIE!
HEE HEE! LOOK,
IT'S TIGGER!
IT'S MY DAUGHTER'S.
KATIE TORE IT UP
ONCE, AND--
SHE'S HERE, RIGHT?
WHERE IS SHE?
CHRIS, HERE IS BIG ENOUGH
FOR EVERYBODY TO HAVE
THEIR OWN PRIVATE UNIVERSE.
THAT'S NOT WHY YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN YOUR KIDS YET...
IS IT?
WELL, WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN, BUDDHA?
I WANT TO SEE
MY CHILDREN, ALBERT!
WHEN YOU DO,
YOU WILL.
DOES THAT HURT?
MM-MM.
THAT?
MM-HMM.
HOW ABOUT THAT?
I'M GOING TO KEEP DOING
THIS TILL YOU TICKLE.
[THERMOMETER BEEPS]
YOU GOT A FEVER.
IT'S GOING DOWN, THOUGH.
DON'T YOU HAVE
TO GO SOMEWHERE?
YOU WANT
TO PLAY CHESS?
I COULD TEACH YOU.
YOU COULD
TEACH ME THAT?
EXCUSE ME.
UH, ALBERT
HAS TO WORK.
HE ASKED ME TO
MEET WITH YOU.
WILL THAT
BE ALL RIGHT?
LEONA? HMM.
IT'S A VERY
BEAUTIFUL NAME.
HE SAID YOU'D
BEEN ISOLATED.
DO YOU WANT
TO SEE OTHERS,
PERHAPS A CITY?
I WOULD, BUT TRAVEL
MAKES ME NAUSEOUS.
[GIGGLES]
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
I DIDN'T MEAN
FOREVER.
[LEONA LAUGHS]
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I THINK I'M
A LITTLE UNDERDRESSED.
YOU LOOK FINE.
UP TILL NOW,
YOU'VE BEEN PAINTING
YOUR OWN WORLD.
THIS IS MINE.
IN OUR CITY
ACROSS THE RIVER,
WE HAVE TO HAVE
A COMMON VISION.
SO...THERE'S WORK.
MM-HMM.
I LIKE THAT.
ALBERT,
FOR EXAMPLE,
HE'S SORT OF
A MISSIONARY...
SAVING LOST SOULS.
LIKE ME.
HARDLY.
THEY'RE THE ONES
WHO CAN'T GET HERE.
YOU MEAN,
FROM HELL?
IN A WAY.
IT'S PROBABLY
NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
MY WORK,
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IS WITH ANIMALS.
HA HA HA! KATIE'S
AN OLD FRIEND.
Annie: DEAREST CHRISTY...
I DON'T KNOW HOW
THIS DAY UNRAVELED IN ME.
I WAS SO PROUD OF HOW
I HELD TOGETHER THROUGH
THIS ENDLESS AFTERNOON,
BUT COMING HOME,
I BEGAN TO LOSE IT.
IF I'D HAVE WALKED OUT
THAT NIGHT FOR OUR DOUBLE-D,
YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN
IN THAT TUNNEL DOING ME A FAVOR.
A WHOLE FAMILY LOST
TO CAR CRASHES.
ENOUGH TO MAKE A PERSON
BUY A BIKE.
Chris: WHERE
ARE THEY GOING?
Leona: THEY'RE GOING
TO HELP OTHERS BE
REBORN ON EARTH.
REALLY? REINCARNATION.
[BOY SINGING]
ALBERT SAYS
TO CHEER YOU UP.
YOU HAVE
DIFFICULTY...
LOSING MY WIFE.
YEAH.
AND YOUR CHILDREN?
THEY DIED YEARS AGO.
THAT'S WHY I'M WORRIED
ABOUT MY WIFE.
THEY DIED
IN A TERRIBLE COLLISION.
THE NANNY WAS DRIVING.
IT WASN'T HER FAULT.
AND YOUR WIFE?
MY DAUGHTER HAD
ASKED HER TO DRIVE.
[GIRL GIGGLING]
IT WAS
THE TRUCKER'S FAULT,
BUT MY WIFE BELIEVED
THAT IF SHE'D BEEN
DRIVING THE KIDS,
HER PROTECTIVE INSTINCTS
WOULD HAVE...
[CHILDREN GIGGLING]
* LA LA LA LA
DEE DEE *
ARE YOU OK?
COME ON, KATIE.
WHERE WERE YOU
JUST NOW?
YOUR MIND'S BEEN
WANDERING ALL AFTERNOON.
THINKING OF SOMEONE.
YOUR WIFE MUST HAVE
LOVED HER CHILDREN
VERY MUCH.
VERY MUCH.
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BREAK IN HALF
TO LOVE SOMEBODY.
TELL ME A MEMORY
OF YOUR OWN.
SAY,
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.
Chris: HEY...
THAT'S SOMEBODY
ELSE'S ART.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
YOU WEREN'T LOOKING
ANYWAY.
YOUR MOVE.
IS THIS WHERE WE GO
WHEN WE DIE?
THAT'S A DREAM,
BABY.
IT'S
A BEAUTIFUL ONE.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
DREAMS...
AREN'T REAL.
I KNOW.
IT'S
AFTER MIDNIGHT.
I HAVEN'T WON YET.
IT'S
YOUR FIRST TIME.
NO. I LIKE THAT
I HAVEN'T WON YET.
IT MEANS
YOU'RE NOT CHEATING.
WHEN I WIN,
I REALLY WIN.
JUST WANT TO PLAY
TILL I DO.
UNLESS YOU WANT
TO STOP.
NO. LET'S PLAY
UNTIL YOU WIN.
Chris: SHE DIED
3 MONTHS LATER.
WE PLAYED
EVERY NIGHT.
MEANT THE WORLD
TO ME...
THOUGH
SHE NEVER WON.
* AHH AHH AHH AHH AHH *
* AHH AHH AHH AHH AHH *
I DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THIS
IN THE BODY, YOU KNOW.
WE FLEW
TO SINGAPORE ONCE,
AND MY DADDY SMILED
AT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
WHO...
HA HA! LOOKED LIKE THIS
AND WORE
THIS NAME TAG--LEONA.
[BOTH GIGGLING]
HE SAID ASIAN WOMEN
ARE SO...
LOVELY
AND GRACEFUL AND...
INTELLIGENT.
HE DIDN'T MEAN
ONLY AS--
I KNOW. IT WAS JUST
SOMETHING YOU SAID.
AND WHAT I THOUGHT WAS,
WHEN I GROW UP,
I WANT TO BE THAT.
DO YOU STILL
PLAY CHESS?
I THINK I WAITED
FOR MY PARTNER.
Annie: I SWEAR THAT CALIFORNIA
IS THE STRANGEST PLACE.
THEY SORT OF PUSH YOU
INTO IT SO THAT YOU
CAN GET IT DONE
BEFORE YOUR SHRINK
COMMITS YOU.
THOUGHTFUL LEGISLATION
THERE.
MINE IS SUSPICIOUS.
ANOTHER WEEK,
HE MIGHT COMMIT ME...
FOR MY OWN SAFETY.
I HAD THE HUSBAND AND LOVE
I WAS MEANT TO HAVE,
2 SPECTACULAR CHILDREN...
BLESSINGS NO ONE WOULD
DARE EXPECT FROM ANYTHING
AS ARBITRARY AS LIFE.
AND THE TRUTH IS SIMPLY...
THAT IT'S OVER...
JUST THIS ONE LOOSE END
TO RAVEL UP.
I DON'T GET
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
YOU'RE DEAD,
AND I BLEW THAT.
I DON'T GET
TO SAY GOOD-BYE...
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT:
I'LL CROSS WHATEVER
DISTANCE THERE IS.
I SEND YOU MY LOVE.
[KISS]
HEY.
WHERE WERE YOU?
FAR AWAY.
I GOT CALLED BACK.
I WAS WORKING.
I HAVE NO WORDS
TO THANK YOU...
FOR FINDING MARIE.
IS SHE OK?
MARIE'S FINE.
YOU'LL SEE HER
AGAIN REAL SOON.
SHE SENDS
HER LOVE...
ESPECIALLY NOW.
WE'RE GOING TO GO
THROUGH SOMETHING
VERY HARD RIGHT NOW.
I'M WITH YOU.
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.
CHRIS, ANNIE'S DEAD.
SHE KILLED HERSELF.
IT'S...IT'S NOTHING
I EVER EXPECTED.
LIKE I SAID,
YOU DON'T KNOW US.
Chris: IS THAT KIND
OF AN OCCUPATIONAL
HAZARD OF SOUL MATES?
ONE'S NOT MUCH
WITHOUT THE OTHER?
HEY, BUT SHE'S OK.
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
HER PAIN'S OVER.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
CHRIS.
YEAH, SHE WON'T
CLING LIKE I DID.
NO. YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.
WHEN DO I SEE HER?
NEVER.
YOU NEVER SEE HER.
SHE'S A SUICIDE.
SUICIDES GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
WHAT ARE YOU
PUNISHING HER FOR?
IT'S
NOT PUNISHMENT.
SHE SUFFERED ENOUGH.
NO, NO, NO. THERE ARE
NO JUDGES OR CRIMES HERE.
EVERYBODY'S EQUAL.
IT'S JUST REALITY
AND THE WAY THINGS WORK!
YEAH, AND THE REALITY
IS SUICIDES GO TO HELL!
NO GODDAMN JUDGMENT
IN THAT!
YOU WANT TO FIGHT?
YOU CAN HIDE FROM IT,
OR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT.
WHAT YOU CALL HELL
IS FOR THOSE
WHO DON'T KNOW
THEY'RE DEAD.
THEY CAN'T REALIZE
WHAT THEY'VE DONE,
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO THEM.
THEY'RE TOO SELF-ABSORBED
IN LIFE THAT THEY BUILT
THIS WORLD AROUND THEM--
SELF-ABSORBED?!
THAT DOES NOT APPLY
TO ANNIE, ALL RIGHT?
NO, IT DOESN'T.
NO. SUICIDES
ARE DIFFERENT.
SUICIDES DON'T GO TO HELL
BECAUSE THEY'RE IMMORAL
OR SELFISH.
THEY GO FOR
A VERY DIFFERENT REASON.
EACH OF US HAS
AN INSTINCT THAT
THERE IS A NATURAL ORDER
TO OUR JOURNEY,
AND ANNIE
VIOLATED THAT...
AND SHE WON'T FACE IT.
SHE WON'T REALIZE,
ACCEPT WHAT SHE'S DONE...
AND SHE
WILL SPEND ETERNITY
PLAYING THAT OUT.
YOU'RE STILL SAYING
SHE'S IN HELL.
EVERYBODY'S HELL
IS DIFFERENT.
IT'S NOT ALL FIRE
AND PAIN.
THE REAL HELL IS
YOUR LIFE GONE WRONG.
[THUNDER]
I'M HER SOUL MATE.
I CAN FIND HER.
[THUNDER]
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS WORKS.
IT IS NOT ABOUT
UNDERSTANDING.
IT'S ABOUT
NOT GIVING UP.
YOU SAID
THERE ARE NO RULES.
HOW ABOUT THAT
PURPLE TREE, SPORT?
YOU WERE PRETTY
SURPRISED WHEN THAT ONE
CAME THROUGH TO ME, HMM?
HEY! HA HA HA!
AND IF THERE ARE
NO RULES,
HOW CAN YOU SAY
ALL SUICIDES
ARE THE SAME?
I CAN'T.
I CAN'T.
THAT'S A RULE. OK.
AND HOW CAN YOU SAY
THAT ANNIE CAN'T
REALIZE SHE'S DEAD?
I CAN'T.
OK.
WE ONLY KNOW WHAT WE
AND OTHERS HAVE SEEN,
AND NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN
A SUICIDE BROUGHT BACK!
STICK AROUND, CHIEF.
YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHIN' YET.
Albert: OK, LOOK,
YOU DESERVE YOUR CHANCE.
I'LL FIND US A TRACKER.
[PEOPLE TALKING SOFTLY
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
Albert, softly: HEY!
THIS THE GUY
WHO DOESN'T GIVE UP?
ANYONE EVER TELL YOU
TOO MUCH PERSISTENCE
CAN GET KIND OF STUPID?
CONSTANTLY.
I HEAR THE SAME THING.
I ALSO HEAR
I READ TOO SLOW,
I DON'T NEED GLASSES,
MY EYES BEING A FIGMENT
OF MY IMAGINATION.
YOU CAN HEAR A LOT OF
SMART STUFF AROUND HERE.
IT'S USUALLY RIGHT.
DON'T LET IT
SCREW YOU UP.
I WON'T.
YOUR WIFE
LOVE YOU STRONG?
WE'LL FIND HER,
BUT WHEN YOU FIND HER,
NOTHING WILL MAKE HER
RECOGNIZE YOU.
NOTHING WILL BREAK
HER DENIAL.
IT'S STRONGER
THAN HER LOVE...
IN FACT, REINFORCED
BY YOUR LOVE.
YOU CAN SAY EVERYTHING
YOU LONG TO SAY...
INCLUDING GOOD-BYE.
EVEN IF SHE CAN'T
UNDERSTAND IT...
THEN YOU'LL HAVE
THE SATISFACTION
THAT YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP.
THAT HAS TO BE ENOUGH.
YOU JUST GET ME THERE.
I'LL DECIDE WHAT'S ENOUGH.
WHEN DO WE LEAVE?
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
Chris: ALBERT'S
A SWEET KID.
Tracker: HE IS THAT.
THERE'S A TENDERNESS
I NEVER KNEW IN LIFE.
I GUESS THAT'S BECAUSE
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM
WHEN HE WAS YOUNG.
WERE YOU PROUD
OF YOUR OWN KIDS?
OF COURSE.
OH, WELL, THAT'S
AN EASY BULLSHIT ANSWER.
WHY NOT PUT
SOME THOUGHT BEHIND IT?
I SAID OF COURSE.
I LIKE A SORE POINT.
IT'S JUICE.
JUICE IS STRONG.
IT CONNECTS.
IT MAKES YOU A BETTER
RECEIVER FOR ANNIE.
[WHOOSH]
SHE'S SORT
OF THE TRANSMITTER,
SENDING THOUGHTS OF YOU.
[THUNDER]
[SOULS SCREECHING]
WHAT DID YOU DO
WHEN YOU WERE ALIVE?
YOU MEAN THE LAST TIME?
SURE. WE CAN GO BACK
AND BE REBORN,
BUT ONLY
IF WE CHOOSE TO.
LAST TRIP, I WAS
IN THE SAME LINE
OF WORK--
YOU WERE A SHRINK.
FAIRLY PERCEPTIVE.
[SEA ROARING]
OH, GOD!
YOU WERE EXPECTING
PHYSICAL DANGER?
[SOULS SCREAMING]
WHAT COULD IT DO?
KILL YOU, HUH?
NO. IN HELL,
THERE'S REAL DANGER...
OF LOSING YOUR MIND.
[SOULS SCREAMING]
Annie: BECAUSE HE'S
DROWNING, THAT'S WHY.
HE'S 13 YEARS OLD.
I KNOW HOW OLD
HE IS.
HE NEEDS TO HANG OUT
WITH HIS FRIENDS.
THAT'S WHAT HE NEEDS.
HE NEEDS TO VEG OUT
IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION.
HE NEEDS FOR ONCE IN HIS LIFE
TO READ A FUCKING BOOK
THAT HE ACTUALLY LIKES.
SO YOU SAYING HE'S
GOING THROUGH ALL THIS
SO HE WON'T LET ME DOWN.
NO. IT'S ACTUALLY
WORSE THAN THAT.
HE'S INTO YOU SO DEEP,
HE THINKS HE'S
LETTING HIMSELF DOWN.
YOU SAY HE CAN DO
SOMETHING AND HE CAN'T,
AND THEN HE THINKS HE'S SHIT.
HOW SICK IS THAT?
HOW CAN YOU TAKE ME
OUT OF MY SCHOOL?
HOW CAN YOU JUST
PULL ME OUT?
THIS IS MY LIFE.
DON'T YOU THINK
I CAN MAKE IT?
I MEAN, IF
I REALLY DIG IN--
YEAH, BUT YOU REALLY
GOT TO SHOW ME SOME MORE,
OK, BUDDY? COME ON!
YOU'RE BLOWING IT, IAN!
I'M NOT YOU!
[GROANING]
OH!
AAH!
SHIPWRECKS.
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
Tracker: IT'S
THE GATEWAY TO HELL.
HOW ARE WE DOING?
PICKING UP ANY SIGNALS?
ACTUALLY, NOT A RIPPLE.
IT'S BECAUSE
I WAS THINKING
OF SOMEBODY ELSE.
IT'S A SLAP
IN THE FACE WHEN YOU
WALK THROUGH A DOOR
AND YOU SEE ALL
THESE KIDS TAKING A TEST
AND THEY'RE JUST
BREEZING THROUGH IT
AND FOR YOU
IT JUST KIND OF GOES.
EVERY DAY I SEE HOW
I'M NOT AS GOOD AS YOU
AND EVERYONE ELSE.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I GIVE UP.
Albert: HEY.
Albert: CERBERUS,
THE GUARDIAN.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?
MORE THAN I WANT YOU
IN OR OUT OF SOME SCHOOL,
I WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL WHEN
YOU GO TO BED AT NIGHT.
A LITTLE SCARED.
I KNOW I BELIEVE IN YOU.
IF I WAS GOING THROUGH
FUCKING HELL,
I'D ONLY WANT ONE PERSON
IN THE WHOLE GODDAMN
WORLD BY MY SIDE.
[CHOIR SINGING
MOURNFUL TUNE]
THERE'S A MAN...
IAN NEVER GOT TO KNOW.
THE MAN...
HE WAS GROWING UP TO BE.
HE'S A GOOD-LOOKING,
CLEAR-EYED YOUNG FELLA,
ABOUT 25.
I CAN SEE HIM.
HE'S THE TYPE OF GUY
THAT MEN WANT TO BE AROUND
BECAUSE HE HAS INTEGRITY,
YOU KNOW...
AND HE HAS CHARACTER.
YOU CAN'T FAKE THAT.
AND HE'S A GUY WOMEN
WANT TO BE AROUND, TOO...
BECAUSE THERE'S
TENDERNESS IN HIM...
RESPECT...
LOYALTY...
COURAGE...
AND WOMEN RESPOND TO THAT.
MAKES HIM A TERRIFIC HUSBAND,
THIS GUY.
I SEE HIM AS A FATHER.
THAT'S WHERE
HE REALLY SHINES.
SEE...
WHEN HE LOOKS
IN HIS KID'S EYES,
THAT KID KNOWS THAT HIS DAD
REALLY SEES HIM...
SEES WHO HE IS.
AND THEN THAT CHILD KNOWS
THAT HE'S AN AMAZING PERSON.
HE'S QUITE A GUY.
WE'LL NEVER GET TO MEET...
BUT I WISH I HAD.
Ian's voice: LET'S DO IT.
Ian's voice: COME ON.
SHE COULD BE IN THERE.
[SOULS SHOUTING
MENACINGLY]
NO!
NO!
DON'T!
DON'T DO IT!
DON'T DO THIS!
YOUR MOTHER'S
NOT IN THERE, IAN!
[SILENCE]
YOUR MOM'S
NOT IN THERE, SON.
THERE'S NOT ANOTHER MAN
I'D GO THROUGH HELL WITH.
ELEVATOR TO HELL,
GOING UP.
COME ON.
SO LONG.
WISH US LUCK.
Albert:
I'M GOING WITH YOU.
I'M NOT REALLY
GIVING YOU A CHOICE.
Chris: WHAT
ARE YOU SAYING?
EVER SINCE YOU
BEGAN TO SUSPECT
ALBERT WAS YOUR SON,
YOU'VE LOST ALL SIGNAL
FROM YOUR WIFE.
I'LL CONCENTRATE
HARDER.
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW.
YOU'RE ALL MOUTH
AND NO CHOPS.
ALL YOU'RE GOOD FOR
IS YOUR WIFE LOVES YOU,
AND YOUR BOY IS
A DECISIVE DISTRACTION.
DAMN SHRINKS! YOU DEARLY
LOVE TO SHOVE PEOPLE
AROUND, DON'T YOU?
WE'RE GOING DOWN
TO THE BOTTOM.
THIS IS HIS LAST CHANCE.
HE'S NEVER
BEEN ANYWHERE
LIKE THIS BEFORE.
NEITHER HAVE YOU.
BUT I'VE GOT
A BETTER CHANCE OF
WATCHING ONE THAN TWO.
YOU WANT HIM CLEAR?
Chris: SCREW HIM, IAN.
HE DOESN'T KNOW US.
HE'S NOT FAMILY.
NO. I'M NOT
LEAVING HIM.
IF HE NEVER SEES HER,
NEVER SAYS GOOD-BYE?
Chris:
WE DO IT WITHOUT HIM.
WE DO IT TOGETHER.
COME ON. SHE'S YOUR MOTHER.
LET'S GO.
Albert: DAD, NO.
LISTEN TO ME.
WHEN YOU GET THERE,
YOU DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
YOU FIND HER...
AND YOU BRING HER BACK.
YOU CAN DO IT.
I BELIEVE IN YOU.
DID YOU EVER
STOP TO THINK WHY I
CHOSE TO BE ALBERT?
HE WAS
THE ONLY GUY YOU
EVER LISTENED TO.
LISTEN TO ME NOW!
THINK ABOUT MOM!
THINK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN WE DIED.
THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID TO HER
TO BRING HER BACK!
[SOULS MOANING]
Ian: THINK ABOUT MOM.
THINK ABOUT
WHEN WE DIED.
Annie: I'VE BEEN
TEACHING MYSELF TO SMOKE.
MY DOCTORS CALL IT
AN AFFIRMATION OF LIFE.
IT BEATS
THE STATUE THING.
YOU SAID DIVORCE...
YOU GOT
MY ATTENTION.
I THINK THAT WE'RE
TOO DIFFERENT...
TO STAY TOGETHER.
I MEAN...
WELL, FOR ONE THING,
WHY AREN'T YOU IN HERE?
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO CRAZY?
YOUR CHILDREN DIED.
I REMEMBER.
I REMEMBER THE SILENCE
IN THE HOUSE.
THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE STRONG.
FOR ME?
FOR ME. FOR US.
JUST ON GENERAL
PRINCIPLES.
I LOVED THEM,
ANNIE...
BUT THEY'RE GONE.
NOW, YOU GOT A CHOICE.
LIFE EITHER GOES ON...
OR NOT.
AND YOU CHOOSE LIFE?
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU WIN,
YOU LOSE.
[SOULS TALKING AND
ARGUING AMONGST THEMSELVES]
Man: OH, I GOT A CRAMP!
Man: WELL, IT HASN'T
BEEN A REALLY GOOD DAY.
Tracker: COME ON.
IT'S OUR PRIVATE DECK.
Man: SHUT UP!
Woman: SHUT UP,
ALL OF YOU, MAN!
Woman: I NEVER
TOOK MORE THAN 30%
FROM ANY CLIENT.
THIS MUST BE THE PLACE.
Woman: MISTER, I'M HERE!
Man: INCOMING!
[SOULS GROANING]
Man: HEY, WATCH
WHERE YOU'RE STEPPING!
Chris: OH, SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.
Man: YOU ARE RUDE, SIR!
Man: ANYBODY
GOT A CURE?
Man: NO, MAN.
Chris: EXCUSE ME.
Man: I'M NOT
AN ANIMAL.
Man: UGH!
OH! SORRY.
SON, WELCOME!
WELCOME, SON!
PAPA?
SON.
PAPA.
YOU'RE...
YOU'RE KLAUS.
WELCOME.
NO.
WELCOME. WELCOME.
YOU'RE NOT MY DAD.
SORRY.
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
THEY...
THEY NEVER COME.
DON'T WORRY. IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME.
[SOULS GROANING]
[ANNIE LAUGHING]
Chris: YOU DON'T THINK
IT LOOKS LIKE A DOG?
SURE. YOU ALWAYS
TAKE THE EASY ONES.
WELL, HOW ABOUT
THAT ONE THERE?
THAT LOOKS
LIKE A COMPLETE
24-PIECE DINING SET
WITH A SOUP TUREEN.
SEE THE...
YEAH. THAT
OR A BUNNY RABBIT.
A VERY COMPLEX
BUNNY RABBIT.
[LAUGHS]
OR A VERY
RUBENESQUE BREAST.
HEY.
YOU ALWAYS THINK
THEY'RE BREASTS.
ALL DIFFERENT KINDS
OF BREASTS.
WELL, I LOVE THEM...
YOURS.
OH, OH! WE'RE
GOING TO BE LATE
FOR THE DANCE THING!
WHAT'S THE RUSH?
[SIGHS]
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
THIS IS ALL JUST
TO STALL, RIGHT?
I KNOW WHY YOU
DON'T WANT TO GO.
BUSTED.
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TRY TO DANCE
JUST ONCE?
HMM?
OTHER HUSBANDS
DO IT WHO ARE
JUST AS CLUMSY.
OH, THANK YOU.
OH, COME ON...
IT'S JUST THAT WHEN
EVERYBODY'S DANCING,
I FEEL LIKE...
I'M ALL ALONE
IN A SEA OF FACES.
Chris, softly:
ANNIE!
[INAUDIBLE]
AAH!
NO!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
ANGEL FALLS.
[WHISTLES]
IT'S A LITTLE
EXPENSIVE, YEAH.
BUT IT'S OUR FIRST
DOUBLE-D.
SHOULDN'T IT BE
INCREDIBLE?
NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.
WELL,
THAT'S MY ROLE,
TO BRING ADVENTURE
TO YOUR LIFE.
YOU TAUGHT ME...
THE ONE THING,
THE ONLY THING
I SHOULD ALWAYS
REMEMBER.
WHICH IS?
I FORGOT.
OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.
YOU MUST
NEVER GIVE UP.
NEVER GIVE UP.
NEVER.
Tracker, breathlessly:
SHE'S HERE.
YOU'VE FOUND HER.
IMPRESSIVE.
THAT JOLT
OF FEAR FOR HER--
IT CONNECTED.
Chris: MY GOD,
IS THAT OUR HOUSE?
[WALL CRACKS]
AAH!
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE OUR HOME.
Tracker:
DON'T EVEN THINK THAT.
IT'S AN ILLUSION.
THE WHOLE PLACE--
HER ILLUSION.
SUICIDES CAN GET
PRETTY TORTURED,
PRETTY COMMITTED TO
PUNISHING THEMSELVES.
YOU DON'T WANT
TO PUSH HER THAT WAY.
YOU WANT TO SEE HER,
TELL HER
WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART...
AND THEN GO.
NO PRESSURE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I KNEW YOU COULD
GET US HERE.
YOU'RE A COMPETITOR
WITH A BIG EGO.
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THE FIRST THING ABOUT ME?
YOU CALLED
YOUR SON ALBERT.
WHO WAS THAT?
FIRST DOCTOR
I INTERNED UNDER.
AH.
HE WAS LIKE
A FATHER TO ME.
HIS WORDS WERE GOLD.
A BRILLIANT MIND, HUH?
DO YOU RECALL WHAT
HE PRACTICED BEFORE
HE TURNED TO PEDIATRICS?
CHILD PSY--
PSYCHIATRY.
YEAH.
AND HE WAS ALWAYS
A SLOW READER...
BUT THESE USED
TO BE RIMLESS...
AND THE REST OF ME
USED TO BE BLACK.
[LAUGHING]
AND YOU KNOW
WHY WE CHOSE TO
LOOK SO DIFFERENT,
ME AND THE CHILDREN?
PACKAGE DOESN'T COUNT
WHEN ONE'S AS GOOD AS--
OH, NO.
THE OLD BAGGAGE,
OLD ROLES
OF AUTHORITY--
WHO'S THE TEACHER,
WHO'S THE FATHER--
GETS IN THE WAY OF
WHO WE REALLY ARE
TO EACH OTHER.
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR YEARS
FOR THE CHANCE TO
WATCH OUT FOR YOU.
[SIGHS]
AND I'M WATCHING OUT
FOR YOU NOW.
BUT...
THIS ISN'T LIKE
THE REST OF HELL, SON.
YOU'VE GOT NO DEFENSE
AGAINST ANNIE.
LOSING YOURSELF AND YOUR
SOUL, BEING SWALLOWED
BY HELL ITSELF,
IF THAT COULD
POSSIBLY SAVE HER,
I'D SAY GO FOR IT.
I'D BE THERE
CHEERING YOU ON.
YOU'VE GOT YOUR CHILDREN
BACK NOW.
THEY NEED YOU.
3 MINUTES.
ANY MORE, YOU COULD
LOSE YOUR MIND.
HOW CAN YOU LOSE
YOUR MIND?
ONCE HER REALITY
BECOMES YOURS,
THERE'S REALLY
NO WAY BACK.
[DOOR CREAKING]
Ian: THINK ABOUT MOM...
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID TO HER
TO BRING HER BACK.
[THUD]
HELLO?
[VOICE ECHOING]
YOUR DOOR'S OPEN.
[BOARDS CREAKING]
[GASP]
[BREATHLESSLY]
SORRY. SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SCARE YOU.
WHO ARE YOU?
I'M YOUR NEIGHBOR.
JUST BOUGHT
THE GORMANS' PLACE
2 MONTHS AGO.
I JUST MOVED IN.
I NEVER HEARD THEY
SOLD THEIR PLACE.
YOU'RE ANNIE NIELSEN,
RIGHT?
THEY TOLD ME A LOT
ABOUT YOU.
LIKE WHAT?
WHAT DID THEY SAY?
THAT YOU'RE A VERY
TALENTED ARTIST
AND WORK FOR
A MUSEUM, RIGHT?
AND, UH,
YOU'RE A WIDOW.
MRS. GORMAN ADMIRED
YOUR ROSES VERY MUCH.
THEY WERE SO HANDSOME...
BUT NOW THERE'S
NO WATER PRESSURE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
[DEBRIS FALLING]
THERE'S NO...
ELECTRICITY
AND NO GAS AND...
AND THERE...
THERE ARE OTHER
THINGS MISSING, TOO,
YOU KNOW,
LIKE ALL
MY CLEAN CLOTHES
AND THE BOOKS
I WANT TO READ,
AND, UM...
SOME OF MY FAVORITE
PAINTINGS,
THE ONES...
I HAVE TO WORK ON.
[SCREAMING]
DON'T TOUCH IT!
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE NOW,
EVERY DAY.
I GOT IT!
IT'S GONE.
[SIGHS]
THANK YOU.
LOOK...
YOU SAY YOUR PAINTINGS
ARE MISSING.
SOME OF
MY MOST PRECIOUS...
PANELS--THE ONES
THAT REMIND ME...
REMIND ME OF MY HUSBAND
AND MY CHILDREN.
THAT'S WHY...
I NEVER LEAVE.
BECAUSE
THEY MIGHT RETURN?
I HOPE THAT'S TRUE
WITH ALL MY HEART.
IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW.
WHEN YOU'RE DEAD,
YOU DISAPPEAR.
MY WIFE
COMMITTED SUICIDE
AFTER OUR
CHILDREN DIED,
AFTER I...
SHE WAS
THE LOVELIEST PERSON.
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S SAD?
DON'T YOU HAVE TO LEAVE?
NO, BUT IF YOU
WANT ME TO GO--
I DO.
ALL RIGHT.
THE LAST DAY I SAW
MY WIFE, IT WAS
OUR ANNIVERSARY.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE.
IN A MINUTE.
I'LL JUST STICK AROUND
IN CASE THERE'S
ANOTHER PROBLEM.
IT WASN'T
A WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.
IT WAS A VERY SPECIAL
KIND OF DAY...
NO ONE ELSE
KNOWS ABOUT.
[ANNIE HUMMING SOFTLY]
Chris: I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU,
AND YOU DON'T
HAVE TO RESPOND.
THIS IS
A ONE-WAY TICKET...
FOR ME.
MY HANGING AROUND HERE
IS NOT HELPING YOU,
BUT IT'S KILLING ME.
SO...
TODAY'S KIND OF A D-DAY.
"D" FOR DECISION,
I GUESS...
ABOUT DIVORCE.
THAT WOULD BE 2 Ds,
WOULDN'T IT?
I STAND CORRECTED.
LOOK WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU DON'T SAY
ANYTHING FOR A MONTH.
CINDY CALLED.
SHE SAID EVERYTHING'S
WAITING FOR YOU.
ALL THE ARTISTS
AND CURATORS
WILL MEET WITH YOU
WHEN YOU'RE BETTER.
AND I TOLD HER...
IT WAS THE MUSEUM...
ONE OF THOSE MEETINGS...
THAT KEPT YOU
FROM DRIVING THAT DAY.
AND IF YOU WENT BACK,
IT WOULD MEAN
YOU WEREN'T SORRY
AND YOU WEREN'T WRONG,
AND YOU WOULD BE
BETRAYING YOUR CHILDREN.
AND SHE SAID
YOU WERE CRAZY,
AND I SAID SHE
WAS A SOULLESS BITCH,
AND I HUNG UP
ON HER,
AND THAT DIDN'T
GO OVER VERY WELL.
WHAT'S TRUE
IN OUR MINDS IS TRUE,
WHETHER SOME PEOPLE
KNOW IT OR NOT.
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED
I'M PART OF THE PROBLEM.
NOT BECAUSE I REMIND YOU...
BUT BECAUSE I COULDN'T
JOIN YOU.
SO I LEFT YOU ALONE.
DON'T GIVE UP, OK?
OK.
OK?
[SOBBING]
IT'S OK.
[SOBBING]
Annie, voice-over:
SO YOU RECONCILED?
THAT'S VERY ROMANTIC.
BUT SHE STILL
KILLED HERSELF.
IN THE END,
SHE GAVE UP.
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THAT.
HER HUSBAND DIDN'T
THINK SO.
HE WAS A COWARD.
BEING STRONG,
NOT GIVING UP--
THAT WAS JUST
HIS PLACE TO HIDE.
HE PUSHED AWAY
THE PAIN SO HARD,
HE DISCONNECTED
HIMSELF
FROM THE PERSON
HE LOVED THE MOST.
SOMETIMES WHEN
YOU WIN, YOU LOSE.
WHEN HE SAW
HIS CHILDREN AGAIN--
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOUR CHILDREN WERE DEAD.
YOU CAN SEE
THE DEAD...
IN YOUR DREAMS,
IF YOU WANT TO.
I WANT TO SEE CHRISTY.
I COULD SHOW YOU.
IT'S NOT HARD.
YOU KNOW?
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO,
IT'S LIKE PAINTING
A PICTURE.
WE DO IT TOGETHER.
JUST
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
DON'T BE AFRAID.
REMEMBER WHERE
YOU WERE MARRIED?
[ANNIE GASPS]
CHRISTY.
CHRISTY.
WHO ELSE WOULD YOU BE
MARRYING IN YOUR DREAMS?
Annie, softly:
I MISSED YOU SO.
ANNIE?
THIS IS REAL.
THE MAN IN THE GARDEN...
IS ME.
NO!
NO!
WHOEVER YOU ARE,
WHATEVER YOU ARE,
DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD TAKE HIM FROM ME?!
I'M SORRY, BABY...
BUT THERE'S SOME THINGS
I HAVE TO SAY,
AND I'VE ONLY GOT
A FEW MOMENTS LEFT.
I'M SORRY
FOR ALL THE THINGS
I'LL NEVER GIVE YOU.
I'LL NEVER BUY YOU
ANOTHER MEATBALL SUB
WITH EXTRA SAUCE.
THAT WAS A BIG ONE.
I'LL NEVER
MAKE YOU SMILE.
I JUST WANTED US
TO BE OLD TOGETHER,
JUST 2 OLD FARTS
LAUGHING AT EACH OTHER
AS OUR BODIES
FELL APART.
TOGETHER AT THE END
BY THAT LAKE
IN YOUR PAINTING.
IT WAS OUR HEAVEN,
SEE?
THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS
TO MISS.
BOOKS...
NAPS...
KISSES...
AND...
FIGHTS.
[LAUGHING]
OH, GOD, WE HAD
SOME GREAT ONES.
[SOFTLY]
THANK YOU FOR THOSE.
THANK YOU
FOR EVERY KINDNESS.
THANK YOU
FOR OUR CHILDREN,
FOR THE FIRST TIME
I SAW THEM.
THANK YOU FOR BEING
SOMEONE I WAS ALWAYS
PROUD TO BE WITH...
FOR YOUR GUTS,
FOR YOUR SWEETNESS...
FOR HOW
YOU ALWAYS LOOKED,
FOR HOW I ALWAYS
WANTED TO TOUCH YOU.
GOD, YOU WERE MY LIFE.
I APOLOGIZE FOR
EVERY TIME I FAILED YOU,
ESPECIALLY THIS ONE.
Chris: YOU DIDN'T THINK
I'D MAKE IT OUT, HUH?
Tracker: YOU WERE
IN THERE AWHILE.
TOOK ME AWHILE TO
REALIZE YOU WERE RIGHT.
NOTHING YOU CAN DO
COULD EVER HELP HER.
THIS TRIP WAS ALWAYS
JUST FOR YOU.
DID YOU COME CLOSE--
TO LOSING IT?
OH, YEAH.
PUSHED HER
RIGHT TO THE EDGE.
THAT'S WHY I HAD
TO COME OUT NOW,
TELL YOU
I'M GIVING UP.
JUST NOT THE WAY
YOU THINK.
GO HOME, AL.
WILL YOU TELL
MY CHILDREN
I LOVE THEM...
AND I WON'T LEAVE
THEIR MOTHER?
[SOFTLY]
THANKS.
WHERE ARE WE HEADED, BABY?
[GASP]
IN ONE MINUTE,
I WON'T KNOW YOU
ANY BETTER THAN
YOU'LL KNOW ME...
BUT WE'LL BE TOGETHER...
WHERE WE BELONG.
GOOD PEOPLE END UP
IN HELL BECAUSE THEY
CAN'T FORGIVE THEMSELVES.
I KNOW I CAN'T.
BUT I CAN FORGIVE YOU.
FOR KILLING
MY CHILDREN...
AND MY SWEET
HUSBAND?
NO.
FOR BEING SO WONDERFUL,
A GUY WOULD CHOOSE
HELL OVER HEAVEN
JUST TO HANG AROUND YOU.
NOT BECAUSE
I REMIND YOU...
BUT BECAUSE
I COULDN'T JOIN YOU.
SORRY I LEFT YOU ALONE.
DON'T GIVE UP, OK?
CHRISTY.
CHRISTY.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THIS PLACE?
IT'S COLD.
[DEBRIS FALLING]
CHRISTY.
OH, GOD, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T GIVE UP.
DON'T GIVE UP.
CHRISTY, CHRISTY.
DON'T GIVE UP!
DON'T! DON'T! DON'T!
DON'T GIVE UP.
DON'T GIVE UP.
CHRISTY!
Annie: CHRISTY,
DON'T GIVE UP!
[ANNIE LAUGHS]
Annie: CHRISTY!
Annie: CHRISTY!
HEY.
REMEMBER ME?
SOMETIMES
WHEN YOU LOSE,
YOU WIN.
[LAUGHS]
[LAUGHING]
HOW DID WE GET HERE?
TRAVEL HERE IS
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE--
IT'S IN YOUR MIND.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS CLOSE YOUR EYES
IF YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.
LOOKS LIKE WE DID.
YOU WERE...
I TRIED EVERYTHING.
NOTHING WORKED.
UNTIL...
YOU TRIED JOINING ME.
WHAT SOME FOLKS
CALL IMPOSSIBLE
IS JUST STUFF THEY
HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE.
[LAUGHS]
Tracker:
EXCUSE ME, LADY.
READY FOR THAT SURPRISE
I PROMISED?
YEAH.
[DOG BARKS]
[ANNIE LAUGHING]
HEY!
THAT'S NOT THE SURPRISE.
Child: MOMMY?
[MARIE CRYING HAPPILY]
[MARIE AND ANNIE LAUGHING]
Annie: I WANT US
TO GROW OLD TOGETHER.
CAN WE DO THAT HERE?
MM-HMM.
I WANT IT ALL...
AS LONG AS
IT'S WITH YOU.
IT WILL BE.
BUT WHAT ABOUT
GOING BACK...
BEING REBORN?
SEE, THAT'S
THE ONE THING
WE CAN'T HAVE HERE.
FINDING EACH OTHER
ALL OVER AGAIN.
FALLING IN LOVE.
MAKE DIFFERENT
CHOICES.
TRY AGAIN.
YEAH.
AVOID SHARP OBJECTS.
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE KIDS.
THEY'LL BE HERE.
THEY WANT US TO GO.
A WHOLE HUMAN LIFE
IS JUST A HEARTBEAT
HERE IN HEAVEN,
THEN WE'LL ALL BE
TOGETHER FOREVER.
[GIGGLES]
YEAH.
HOW WILL I FIND YOU?
I FOUND YOU IN HELL.
DON'T YOU THINK I COULD
FIND YOU IN JERSEY?
[LAUGHING]
Chris: WHEN I WAS YOUNG,
I MET THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL
BY A LAKE.
