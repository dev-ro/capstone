THE GOSPEL
ACCORDING TO MATTHEW
To the fond, happy,
friendly memory of John XXIII
Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid
to take Mary as your wife,
for she has conceived
by the power of the Holy Ghost.
She wil I bear a son
whom you will call Jesus,
for he is to save his people
from their sins.
The virgin shall be with child
and shall bear a son
and they shall call him Emmanuel,
meaning God with us.
Where has the King
of the Jews been born?
We have seen his star in the east,
a nd have come to worship him.
Where will Christ be born?
At Bethlehem in Judea,
the prophet wrote:
"And you, Bethlehem,
in the land of Judea
"art far from the least
among the princes of Judea.
"For out of you will arise a leader
"who is to be the shepherd
of my people Israel."
Seek the child,
and when you have found him
bring me word so I too may come
and worship him.
Take the child and his mother,
flee to Egypt and remain there
until I give you word.
For Herod will soon search
for the child, to destroy him.
I called my son out of Egypt.
A voice was heard in Ramah -
the sound of wailing and great sorrow.
Rachel wept for her children,
she would not be comforted,
because they are no more.
Take the child and his mother
and return to Israel,
for those who sought
the child's Iife are dead.
Repent, the kingdom of heaven
is at hand.
He was the one the prophet Isaiah
was referring to when he said:
"There is a voice of one crying
in the wilderness.
"Prepare the way of the Lord,
"make his paths straight."
Brood of vipers! Who taught you
to flee from the coming wrath?
Bring forth fruit
that is worthy of your repentance.
Do not presume to say in your hearts:
"We have Abraham for our father."
God has power to raise up children
to Abraham out of these very stones.
Already the axe has been put
to the root of the trees,
so that every tree that
does not bear good fruit
will be cut down
and cast into the fire.
I am baptising you with water,
for your repentance.
But one is to come after me
who is mightier than I,
so that I am not worthy even
to carry his shoes for him.
He will baptise you
with the Holy Ghost and with fire.
He holds his winnowing fan
to sweep
his threshing-floor clean.
He will gather the wheat
into his barn
but the chaff he will burn
with unquenchable fire.
It is I that ought to be
baptised by you.
Do you come to me?
Let it be so for now,
so that we may justly fulfil
our religious duty.
This is my beloved Son
in whom I am well pleased.
If you are the Son of God,
turn these stones into bread.
Man cannot live by bread alone
but by all the words which
proceed from the mouth of God.
If you are the Son of God, cast yourself
down to earth. For it is written:
"He has charged angels
to watch over you
"lest you should trip on a stone."
It is further written: "You shall not put
the Lord your God to the proof."
I will give you all these,
if you will fall down and worship me.
Away with you, Satan!
It is written: "You shall worship the Lord
your God, and serve none but him."
The people who were dwelling in darkness
have seen a great light.
For men living in a land where death
overshadowed them, light has dawned.
Repent, the kingdom of heaven
is at hand.
Peter.
Andrew.
Come and follow me,
I will make you fishers of men.
James and John, sons of Zebedee,
come with me.
The harvest is plentiful,
but the labourers are few.
Ask the Lord whose harvest it is
to send labourers for the harvesting.
Peter.
Andrew.
James.
John.
Philip.
Thomas.
Simon.
Bartholomew.
Thaddaeus.
James, son of Alphaeus.
Matthew.
Judas Iscariot.
You shall be labourers
for the harvesting.
I am sending you to be
like sheep among wolves.
You must be wary as serpents,
yet innocent as doves.
Be on your guard against men.
They'll hand you over to their courts
and flog you in their synagogues.
On my account you will bear witness
before governors, kings and Gentiles.
When you are given up into their hands
do not fear what to say,
because when the time comes,
you will be given the right words.
It is not you who will be speaking,
but the Spirit of your Father
speaking through you.
You will be hated by all men
because you bear my name.
Fear not those who kill the body
but have no means of killing the soul.
Fear him more who has the power
to ruin body and soul in hell.
Are not sparrows sold
two for a penny?
Yet not one of them may fall to the ground
without your Father's will.
Every hair of your head
he takes into his reckoning.
Fear not, you count more
than a host of sparrows.
Do not imagine I have come
to bring peace to the earth.
I have come to bring a sword,
not peace.
I have come to set a man
against his father,
and a daughter
against her mother,
and a daughter-in-law
against her mother-in-law.
A man's enemies
will include members of his own family.
Anyone who loves his father or mother
more than me,
or anyone who loves his son or daughter
more than me is not worthy of me.
If you cling to your life,
you will lose it,
but if you give up your life for me,
you will find it.
Lord, if you are willing,
make me clean.
I am willing, be cleansed.
Tell no man, rather go
and show yourself to the priest
and offer the gift
that Moses commanded
as a testimony to them.
Blessed are the poor in spirit;
the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are those who mourn;
they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the patient;
they shall inherit the land.
Blessed are those who hunger
for holiness; they shall have their fill.
Blessed are the merciful,
for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the clean in heart,
for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peace-makers,
for they will be called
the children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted
for the sake of righteousness,
because the kingdom of heaven
belongs to them.
Blessed are you, when men revile
you and persecute you
and speak all manner of evil
against you falsely because of me.
Rejoice and be glad,
a rich reward awaits you in heaven.
For that is how they persecuted
the prophets who were before you.
If your son asked for bread,
would you give him a stone?
If he asked for a fish,
would you give him a serpent?
If you, evil as you are,
know what is good for your children
will not your Father in heaven give
more good gifts to those who ask?
Do to other men all that you
would have them do to you.
That is the Law and the prophets.
Do not think I have come to set aside
the Law and the prophets.
I have come to bring them
to perfection.
You are the salt of the earth,
but if salt loses its flavour,
how can it be made salty again?
It's no longer good for anything,
except to be thrown out
and trampled under foot by men.
You are the light of the world.
A city on a mountain top
cannot be hidden.
A lamp is not placed under a bushel,
it is put where it will light the house.
Do not lay up treasure on earth
where moths and rust consume it
and where thieves break in
and steal it.
Instead, store up treasure for yourselves
in heaven
where there are no moths, no rust
and no thieves to steal it.
A man cannot serve two masters.
He will hate one and love the other,
devote himself to one, scorn the other.
You may serve God or money;
you cannot serve both.
When you give to the needy,
do not let your left hand know
what your right hand is doing,
so that your merciful deeds
may be in secret.
Then your Father, who sees
what is done in secret, will reward you.
You have heard it said:
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
I tell you, do not offer resistance.
If a man strikes you
on your right cheek, turn the other.
You have heard it said: "Love your
neighbour and hate your enemy."
I tell you: Love your enemies
and pray for those who persecute you
so that you may be true sons
of your Father in heaven
who makes his sun rise on the evil
and on the good,
his rain fall on the just
and on the unjust.
Do not judge others,
or you yourselves will be judged.
For in the way you judge,
you will be judged
and by your standard of measure,
it will be measured to you.
How is it you see the speck of sawdust
in your brother's eye
and are not aware
of the log in your own?
When you pray, don't use
vain repetitions as the Gentiles do.
They think that by being so wordy
they will be heard.
You are not to be like them.
Your Father knows well what your
needs are before you ask him.
This, then, is to be your prayer...
Our Father in heaven,
Hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our sins
as we forgive those
who sin against us.
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
Therefore I tell you,
do not worry about everyday life,
what you will eat or drink,
or about your body,
what you will wear.
Is not life
more important than food,
and the body
more important than clothes?
Look at the birds of the air,
they do not sow, or reap,
or gather grain into barns,
and yet your heavenly Father
feeds them.
Are you not more valuable
than they are?
Indeed, which of you can make
his life any longer by being anxious?
Why should you be anxious
about clothing?
See how the lilies of the field grow,
they don't work
or make their clothing,
and yet I tell you
that even Solomon in all his glory
was not dressed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grasses
of the field,
which live today and will be thrown
into the fire tomorrow,
will he not be much more ready
to clothe you, men of little faith?
Do not fret then, asking
what you will eat or drink or wear.
It is for the Gentiles to busy
themselves over such things -
you have a Father in heaven
who knows that you need them all.
Seek first the kingdom of God
and his righteousness,
and all these things
will be given to you as well.
Do not worry about tomorrow,
for tomorrow will worry about itself.
Today's trouble is enough for today.
Make your way in by the narrow gate.
It is a broad gate and a wide road
that leads to perdition
and those who go that way
are many indeed.
How small the gate, how narrow
the road that leads to life
and how few there are that find it.
Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
I give you praise
that you have hidden this
from the wise
and revealed it to children.
Yes, Father, because this is what
was pleasing to you.
My Father has entrusted everything
into my hands.
No one knows the Son
except the Father.
And no one knows the Father
except the Son
and those to whom
the Son chooses to reveal him.
Come to me, all you who are weary
and burdened; I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon yourselves
and learn from me.
I am gentle and humble of heart;
you shall find rest for your souls.
For my yoke is easy
and my burden is light.
Your disciples are doing
what is not lawful on the Sabbath.
Have you never read what David did,
when he and his followers hungered?
How he went into the tabernacle,
and ate the loaves set out there
although neither he nor anyone
but the priest had the right to eat them?
Or have you not read in the Law
that on the Sabbath,
the priests on duty in the temple may work
and yet remain innocent?
I tell you, there is one standing here
who is greater than the temple.
If you'd understood the words,
"I desire mercy, not sacrifice",
you would not have condemned
the guiltless.
For the Son of Man
is Lord over the Sabbath.
Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?
If one of your sheep fell into a pit
would you not pull it out
on a Sabbath?
What is a sheep compared to a man?
Mercy is not unlawful on the Sabbath.
Throw away your crutches.
Tell no man that you have been healed
so that the word spoken
by Isaiah may be fulfilled.
Behold my servant, my chosen,
with whom my soul is well pleased.
I will lay my spirit on him,
and he shall proclaim my rule
among Gentiles.
He will not protest and cry out;
none shall hear his voice in the streets.
He will not break a bruised reed
or quench a smouldering wick
until the time comes when he
crowns his judgement with victory.
We must find a way
to make away with him.
This is a remote place,
and it is already getting late.
Send all these people to the village
to buy food for themselves.
They don't need to go away.
You give them something to eat.
We have only five loaves
and two fishes.
Bring them to me.
I am going to pray.
Take a boat
and cross to the other side.
It's a ghost.
Take courage, it is I.
Do not be afraid.
Lord, if it is you, bid me
to come to you over the water.
Come!
Lord, save me!
Why did you hesitate,
man of little faith?
Is it his coming that was foretold
or are we yet waiting for
some other?
John has sent us to ask if it is
your coming that was foretold.
Go and tell John what your own ears
and eyes have witnessed.
How the blind see, the lame walk,
lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,
the dead are raised to life, the poor
have the Gospel preached to them.
Blessed is the man
who does not lose confidence in me.
What did you go out
into the desert to see?
A reed swayed by the wind?
If not, what did you go out to see?
A man dressed in fine clothes?
No, those who wear fine clothes
are in kings' palaces.
So why then did you go out?
To see a prophet?
Yes, and something more
than a prophet.
This is the man
of whom it was written:
"I am sending before you that angel
of mine who is to prepare the way."
God has raised up no greater son
of woman than John the Baptist.
Yet to be least in the kingdom of
heaven is to be greater than he.
Ever since John the Baptist's time
the kingdom of heaven
has suffered violence,
and violent people
have been seizing it.
All the prophets and the Law
before John's time
spoke only of things
that were to come.
If you are willing to accept it,
he is that Elijah
whose coming was prophesied.
As for this generation,
to what shall I compare it?
It is like children
sitting in the marketplaces
who call out to their companions,
"We played the flute for you,
and you did not dance.
"We sang a dirge,
and you did not mourn."
John would not eat or drink,
and they say he is possessed.
The Son of Man came, ate and drank
and they call him a glutton,
friend of publicans and sinners.
But wisdom is proved right
by her actions.
Woe to you, cities where I did
miracles and you have not repented.
If Tyre and Sidon had witnessed
such miracles as I have done in you,
they would have repented
in sackcloth and ashes long ago.
I tell you, Tyre and Sidon will be better off
on judgement day than you.
And you, Capernaum, do you hope
to be lifted to heaven?
You shall fall low as hell.
Can this be the Son of David?
It is only through the power of
Beelzebub that he casts devils out.
He who is not with me,
is against me.
And he who doesn't gather with me,
scatters.
There is pardon for all the other sins
and blasphemies of men,
but not for blasphemy
against the Holy Spirit.
Master, may we see a sign from you?
Wicked and unfaithful generation,
the only sign that will be given
is the sign of the prophet Jonah.
Jonah was three days and nights
in the belly of the sea-beast.
The Son of Man will be three days
and nights in the earth.
The men of Nineveh will condemn
this generation on judgement day
for they did penance to Jonah,
and now one greater than Jonah
is here.
The queen of the south will
condemn this generation
for she came from the ends of the earth
to hear Solomon's wisdom.
And, behold,
one greater than Solomon is here.
Your mother and your brothers
are outside, they want to speak to you.
When an evil spirit leaves a person
it goes into the desert,
seeking rest but finding none.
Then it says, "I will return to my house
from which I came."
And when it comes, it finds the house
empty, swept, and put in order.
So then the spirit finds seven other
spirits more evil than itself,
and they all enter in
and live there
and the last state of that person
is worse than the first.
That is how it will be
with this wicked generation.
Your mother and brothers are here.
Who is my mother,
and who are my brothers?
Here are my mother and brothers!
If anyone does the will
of my Father in heaven
he is my brother, and sister,
and mother.
How did he come by this wisdom,
and these miraculous powers?
Isn't his mother Mary
and his brothers James, Joseph,
Simon and Judas?
And his sisters live near us, don't they?
Where then did he get
all these things?
Isn't he just the carpenter's son?
A prophet is not without honour,
unless in his country and in his house.
Master, what shall I do
to win eternal life?
Why do you ask me about
what is good?
There is only one who is good.
If you want to enter into life,
keep the commandments.
Which ones?
Do not murder,
do not commit adultery,
do not steal,
do not bear false witness,
honour your father and mother,
and love your neighbour as yourself.
All these I have kept.
What do I still lack?
If you want to be perfect,
go, sell your possessions
and give to the poor
and you will have treasure in heaven.
Then come, follow me.
Truly, I say to you,
it is hard for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven.
It is easier for a camel to pass
through a needle's eye
than for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of heaven.
Christ, bless our children.
Leave the Lord in peace.
Let the children be,
do not keep them from me.
The kingdom of heaven
belongs to such as these.
Your dance has pleased me;
I will grant whatever you wish.
Give me here on a platter
the head of John the Baptist.
It is granted.
Let us withdraw into desert country,
to be alone.
Follow me over to the other side.
Lord, give me leave to go home
and bury my father.
Follow me, and leave the dead
to bury their dead.
Master, I will follow you
wherever you are going.
Foxes have holes
and birds their nesting places.
The Son of Man has nowhere
to lay his head.
Howl, O gate.
Cry, O city.
Thou, whole Palestine, art dissolved,
for a smoke shall come
from the north.
In their streets they shall
gird themselves with sackcloth.
On the tops of their houses,
and in their streets
e veryone shall weep abundantly.
Who do men say is the Son of Man?
So me say John the Baptist.
Others Elijah.
Others Jeremy.
Or one of the prophets.
What do you say that I a m?
You are the Christ,
the Son of the living God.
Blessed are you, Simon, son of John.
It is not flesh and blood, it is my Father
that has revealed this to you.
And I tell you that you are Peter.
And it is upon this rock
that I will build my church
and the gates of hell
shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys
of the kingdom of heaven.
Whatever you imprison on earth
God will imprison in heaven.
And whatever you set free on earth
shall be set free in heaven.
You are to tell no one
that I am the Christ.
I must go up to Jerusalem
and suffer many things at the hands
of the chief priests, elders and scribes
and then be put to death.
Never, Lord.
This shall never happen to you.
Back, Satan! For these thoughts
of yours are men's, not God's.
If anyone wants to be my follower,
let him renounce self,
take up his cross, and follow me.
The Son of Man is to be given
into the hands of men.
They will put him to death,
and on the third day,
he will rise again.
Who is the greatest
in the kingdom of heaven?
Unless you become
like little children again
you shall not enter
the kingdom of heaven.
Whoever humbles himself like this child
is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And he who welcomes such a child,
welcomes me.
But if anyone causes one of these
little ones who believe in me to sin
it would be better for him to have
a large millstone hung around his neck
and to be drowned in the depths
of the sea.
Woe to the world
because it tempts people to sin.
Temptations are inevitable,
but woe to the man
who causes someone to sin.
If your hand or foot causes you to sin
cut it off and cast it away
from you.
Better to enter into life
crippled or lame
than to have hands and feet
when you are cast into eternal fire.
What do you yourselves think?
If a man has a hundred sheep
and one has strayed
does he not leave the ninety-nine
and go to look for the stray?
If, by good fortune, he finds it,
he rejoices more over that one
than over those that did not stray.
In the same way
your Father in heaven is not willing
that any of these little ones
should be lost.
Lord, if my brother commits
an offence against me
how many times
must I forgive him?
Up to seven times?
No, not just seven times,
but seventy times seven!
Now we are going up to Jerusalem.
The Son of Man will be given up
into the hands of the chief priests
and the scribes
who will condemn him to death
and then turn him over
to the Gentiles
to be flogged and crucified.
But on the third day
he will rise again.
Go to the village ahead of you,
and at once you will find a donkey
tied there, with her colt by her.
Go and bring them to me.
If anyone asks
say that the Lord needs them,
and he will let you have them.
It is Jesus, Son of David.
It is written, "My house shall be called
a house of prayer."
But you have turned it into
a den of thieves.
Hosanna!
Hosanna to the Son of David!
- Do you hear what they are saying?
- Yes.
Have you never read the words:
"From the lips of children and infants
you have ordained praise"?
May you never bear fruit again.
How has it withered so quickly?
Truly I say to you,
if you have faith and do not doubt,
you will not only do
what was done to the fig tree,
but even if you say to this mountain,
"Be taken up and thrown into the sea",
it will happen.
Every gift you ask for in prayer
will be granted.
By what authority do you do
these things?
Who gave you this authority?
I too have a question to ask.
If you can answer me
I will tell you what is my authority.
Did John's baptism come from heaven
or from men?
If we tell him it was from heaven,
he will ask:
"Then why did you not believe him?"
If we say from men,
then we'll be mobbed
because the people believe
John was a prophet.
We cannot tell.
Then I won't tell you by what authority
I do these things.
Tell me what you think:
a man had two sons
and he asked the first to work
in his vineyard that day.
The son refused, but relented
afterwards and went.
He asked his second son to work
in the vineyard.
The son said he would go,
but did not go.
Which of the two
did his father's will?
The second.
Truly, I say to you
the publicans and harlots are further
on the road to God's kingdom than you
because John came to you
following all due observance,
and you did not believe him.
The publicans believed him,
and the harlots
but even when you saw that
you would not relent,
and believe him.
Listen to another parable.
There was a landowner
who planted a vineyard.
He walled it, dug a wine-press,
and built a watchtower.
Then he rented the vineyard
to some farmers and went on a journey.
At harvest time he sent his servants
to collect his share of the crop.
But the vine-growers
grabbed his servants,
they beat one, killed one,
and stoned a third.
Then he sent more servants
than the first time,
and the vine-growers treated them
the same way.
In the end he sent his son,
thinking he would be respected.
But when the vine-growers saw the son,
they said to each other,
"This is the heir.
Let's kill him and take his inheritance."
So they took him and threw him
out of the vineyard and killed him.
Now when the owner
of the vineyard returns,
what will he do
to those vine-growers?
He will bring those wretches
to a wretched end
and will rent out the vineyard
to others who will pay him his due.
Have you never read
in the scriptures:
"The stone which the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone -
"this is the Lord's doing,
and it is marvellous in our eyes"?
I tell you the kingdom of God
will be taken away from you
and given to a nation
that will exhibit the power of it.
When a man falls against the stone,
he will break his bones.
When it falls on him,
it will scatter him like chaff.
Many are called,
but few are chosen.
Master, we know well
that you are sincere
and teach in all sincerity
the ways of God.
You hold no one in awe, making
no distinction between man and man.
Tell us, then, is it right
to pay tribute to Caesar, or not?
Hypocrites, why test me thus?
Show me the coin
used for paying the tax.
Whose likeness,
whose name is inscribed on it?
Caesar.
Give to Caesar what is Caesar's
and to God what is God's.
Master, master...
Moses told us that if a man leaves
no children when he dies,
his brother should marry the widow
and have a child
who will carry on the brother's name.
We had seven brothers in our country,
of whom the first died
a married man without issue,
bequeathing his wife to the second.
He died, bequeathing her
to the third
and finally she had been every
brother's wife, dying last of all.
When the dead rise again,
which brother will be her husband?
You do not understand the scriptures,
or what is the power of God.
When the dead rise again, there is
no marrying or giving in marriage.
They are as the angels in heaven are.
Have you never read what God himself
said of the resurrection?
I am the God of Abraham,
of Jacob, and of Isaac.
Yet it is of living men, not dead men,
that he is God.
Master, which is the greatest
commandment in the Law?
Love the Lord your God
with all your heart
with all your soul
and with all your mind.
This is the greatest
of the commandments, and the first.
And the second is like it.
Love your neighbour
as yourself.
The Law of Moses is interpreted
by the scribes and the Pharisees.
Do what they tell you,
observe what they tell you
but do not imitate their actions,
because they do not practise
what they preach.
They tie up heavy loads
that are hard to bear
and put them on men's shoulders,
but they're not willing to lift a finger
to ease the burden.
Everything they do
is done for men to see.
They make their headbands large
and the tassels on their shawls long.
They love to sit at the head table
at banquets and in the synagogue
and respectful greetings
in the market places,
and they love
being called Rabbi by men.
But don't you be called "Rabbi",
because you have only one Master
and you are all brothers.
And do not call anyone on earth
your "father",
for you have just one father
and he is in heaven.
Nor are you to be called teachers;
you have one teacher, the Christ.
The greatest of all
is to be the servant of all.
The man who exalts himself
will be humbled.
The man who humbles himself
will be exalted.
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees,
you hypocrites
that shut the door of the kingdom
of heaven in men's faces.
You will not enter, nor let others
enter when they would.
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees,
you hypocrites.
You travel over land and sea
to win a single convert
and when he becomes one,
you make him twice as worthy
of damnation as yourselves.
Woe upon you, blind leaders,
who say:
"If a man swears by the temple,
it means nothing,
"but if he swears by the gold in
the temple, his oath stands."
You blind fools!
Which is greater, the gold,
or the temple that consecrates the gold?
And you say: "If a man swears
by the altar, it means nothing,
"but if he swears by the gift on the altar,
his oath stands."
Blind fools! Which is greater,
the gift or the consecrating altar?
A man who swears by the altar
swears by all that is on it.
He who swears by the temple, swears
by him who has made it his dwelling.
The man who swears by heaven
swears not only by God's throne,
but by him who sits upon it.
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees,
you hypocrites
because you have paid the tithe on
one tenth of your mint, dill, and cumin
but have neglected
more important matters:
justice, mercy and honour.
You should have done these things
without neglecting the others.
You strain your water free of gnats
while you gulp down a camel!
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees,
you hypocrites
that scour clean the outside
of a cup and dish
but inside they are full
of greed and excess.
You blind Pharisee!
First wash the inside of the cup
and then the outside
will become clean, too.
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees,
you hypocrites.
For you are like whitewashed tombs,
which outwardly appear beautiful,
but on the inside are full of dead
men's bones and every kind of impurity.
In the same way too, you outwardly
appear righteous to men's eyes
but on the inside you are full
of hypocrisy and wickedness.
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees,
you hypocrites.
For you build tombs
for the prophets
and decorate monuments
to the righteous.
You say: "If we had lived
in our fathers' time
"we would not have murdered
the prophets."
Thereby testifying that you are
the descendants of those
who murdered the prophets.
It is for you to complete
your fathers' reckoning.
Brood of vipers, how are you to escape
being condemned to hell?
And so, I am sending wise men
and prophets to preach to you.
Some you will put to death
and crucify,
some you will flog
in your synagogues
and persecute from city to city.
As a result, you will become answerable
for spilling the blood of all just men
from the blood of the just Abel
to the blood of Zachariah
whom you slew between
the temple and the altar.
Believe me, this generation shall be
held responsible for all of it.
O Jerusalem, still murdering prophets
and stoning messengers sent to you.
How often have I been ready
to gather your children together
as a hen gathers her chickens
under her wings
and you refused it.
Look, your house is left to you,
uninhabited.
You will not see me again
until the time when you will say:
"Blessed is he that comes
in the name of the Lord."
Do you see all these things?
There will not be a stone left
on another, it will all be thrown down.
It is time for us to take Jesus...
...by some trick...
...and put him to death.
Not during the Passover festival
otherwise a riot might occur
among the people.
Why this waste?
It could have been sold for a high price
and the money given to the poor.
Why are you bothering this woman?
She has done a beautiful thing for me.
You will always have the poor among you,
but you will not always have me.
When she poured ointment over
my body it was to prepare me for burial.
I tell you the truth, wherever this Gospel
is preached throughout the world,
what she has done will also be told,
in memory of her.
What will you pay me for
handing him over to you?
Thirty pieces of silver.
I tell you the truth,
one of you will betray me.
Lord, is it I?
Lord, is it I?
Lord, is it I?
Lord, is it I?
Lord, is it I?
The man who has put his hand into
the bowl with me will betray me.
The Son of Man goes his way,
as the scripture foretells
but woe to the man by whom
the Son of Man is betrayed.
It would be better for that man
if he had never been born.
Master, is it I?
Your own lips have said it.
Take, eat, this is my body.
Drink from it, all of you,
for this is my blood
of the new testament,
which is poured out for many
for the forgiveness of sins.
I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit
of the vine again
until I drink it with you,
new wine, in the kingdom of my Father.
All of you will desert me tonight.
For it has been written:
"I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep
of his flock will be scattered."
But after I have risen, I will go on
ahead of you into Galilee.
Even if everyone else deserts you,
I will never desert you.
This very night, before the cock crows,
you will disown me three times.
Even if I have to die with you,
I will never disown you.
Sit down here, while I go and pray.
Peter, and you two, James and John,
come with me.
My soul is ready to die with sorrow.
Stay here and watch with me.
My Father, if it is possible,
let this cup be taken from me.
Nevertheless, not as I will,
but as you will.
Didn't you have the strength
to watch with me even for one hour?
Watch and pray so that you will not
fall into temptation.
For the spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak.
My Father, if it is not possible for this cup
to be taken away unless I drink it,
then may your will be done.
Put the sword back in its place!
For all those who take up the sword
will perish by the sword!
Do you think I cannot call on my Father,
and he will at once put at my disposal
more than twelve legions of angels?
You come to arrest me with swords
and clubs, as if I were a robber.
Yet day after day I sat teaching
in the temple
and you never laid hands on me.
All this has taken place in order to fulfil
the writings of the prophets.
Greetings, Rabbi.
Friend, do what you came to do.
He said: "I can destroy the temple of God
and rebuild it in three days."
I also heard him say those things.
Have you no answer to make
to these accusations?
I charge you under oath
by the living God
to tell us whether you are Christ,
the Son of God.
Your own lips have said it.
I say to all of you
you will see the Son of God again
when he is seated
at the right hand of God's power
and coming on the clouds of heaven.
He has blasphemed!
Why do we need any more witnesses?
You have heard his blasphemy
for yourselves.
What is your finding?
The penalty is death.
You also were with Jesus of Galilee.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
This man was with
Jesus of Nazareth.
I don't know the man.
You must be one of them,
your accent gives you away.
In the name of the living God,
I know nothing of the man.
He must die.
Give him up to Pontius Pilate.
I have sinned...
...in betraying innocent blood.
What is that to us?
It concerns you only.
It must not be put into the treasury;
it's the price of blood.
We'll use it to buy the potter's field
as a burial place for strangers,
to be known as the Field of Blood.
Don't you hear the testimony
against you?
It is the Passover today,
and as with every Passover
it's customary
to release a prisoner...
...according to your choice.
Whom shall I release? Barabbas,
or Jesus who is called Christ?
What wrong has he done?
Let him be crucified!
I am innocent of this man's blood.
See to it yourselves.
His blood is upon us,
and upon our children!
Hail, King of the Jews!
Carry this cross!
You will be ever hearing,
but never understanding.
You will be ever seeing,
but never perceiving.
The heart of this people
has become dull.
Their ears are slow to listen
and they ha ve closed their eyes.
So they may never see
with those eyes,
and never hear with those ears.
My God, why have you forsaken me?
He's calling for Elijah.
Wait, let's see if Elijah comes
to save him.
I know you have come to look
for Jesus, who was crucified.
He is not here; he has risen,
as he told you.
Go now and tell his disciples
that he has risen from the dead
and he is going ahead of you to Galilee;
you will see him there.
All authority in heaven and earth
has been given to me.
Go therefore
and make disciples of all nations
baptising them in the name of
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost
teaching them to obey all
the commandments I have given you.
And remember, I am with you always,
even to the end of the world.
