Allah is great.
Allah is great.
Allah is great.
All praise is due to Allah.
Lord of the World.
The beneficent. Merciful
master of the day of judgment.
Thee we serve and
thee we beseech for help.
Keep us on the right path.
Shit.
Don't forget your change.
- Greet your mother for me.
- I won't forget.
- Peace with you.
- And to you.
My tomatoes are all over the place.
Help yourself. Neighbor.
The postman's hiding something from me.
No letters from France.
My son doesn't write.
If you'd listened to me.
You'd never have let him go there.
France? Nothing good comes of it.
You better go to a marabout
to make him come back.
Those kids never come back from France.
Or they bring back
white women with their diseases.
My son would never do that.
- I've got to go.
- He's just there to study.
I'll pay when my husband returns.
My ass! You'll pay now!
Give it back.
When are you gonna pay?
We're tired of this.
Let her go.
Wait. I'll pay now.
- You're a stubborn girl.
- Can't leave without paying.
Your mom and I are good friends.
This has never happened before.
Tell Mory to meet me
at the university.
What's he riding today.
A motorcycle or an ox?
Get out of here with your shabby clothes.
You say your a student.
But your head's full of garbage.
That Mory's no good.
He's got no class. No shame.
Wears shabby clothes.
Comes by on that motorcycle.
You go off with that skull on it
like a freak.
Keep going and he'll find you
at that university of yours.
That university's just a dump.
If you want to get your water.
You better listen up.
Everyone wait their turn.
Help her with that.
Okay. Here we go.
Kids. If you've got nothing to do here.
Get out of the way.
Stop it!
Hey. Comrade. Will the revolution
wait much longer for you?
All these chicks
think about is screwing.
Hey! Think this is a circus?
I just came to pick up Anta.
I get it.
It's because of you that
she's always late to our meetings.
I get it! Come to spy on us?
Kill him!
Come on.
Hey. Baby.
Hands off that student rabble!
Know where Mory is. Aunt Oumi?
Don't know. Probably puking up
the rice he owes me.
- That's your problem.
- You haven't heard?
That son of a bitch jumped off
the cliff to get away from me.
I hope he winds up in hell.
There's a boat leaving tomorrow.
Let's take it.
Yeah? You got the bread?
Better pay the sorceress for her rice.
We'll just split
and send her a check later on.
Then what?
No hassle.
It's an easy hustle.
All we need is a bit of ready cash.
Throw it around.
Tip the right guys.
Play it like we're loaded.
Hang out where the money is.
France. Here we come!
Paris. The gateway to paradise.
And when we come back.
They'll call me Mr. Mory.
And you can walk all over
those Red Cross broads
grown fat on the drought.
They'll make you their president.
Ingrate! That's how
you pay for my rice?
Bum! Parasite!
Good-for-nothing!
I'll sick my marabouts on you!
You'll crawl back crying!
I'll get your ass yet!
Just you wait!
Paris, Paris, Paris
It's paradise on earth
- Look at this!
- What?
Some gris-gris.
Don't touch them.
- Who says?
- My grandmother.
Who told her?
Look.
There's all sorts here.
One for broken hearts...
one for syphilis...
and this one's for good luck.
It's the key to wealth.
If you get this one, you lose.
Can I see this one?
That one loses.
Okay, let's go.
Black wins, red loses.
Try your luck.
This one loses. That one loses.
Turn it over.
The black one.
You win.
You haven't played. Your turn.
You get this ace. You win.
You pick this queen. You lose.
You pick that queen. You lose.
- I'm in for ten.
- Ten.
Pick the ace.
- What?
- The ace.
If you don't want the money. Stop playing.
If you get the ace. You win.
Get this one. You lose.
I shuffle. And that's it.
You want to play? Let's go.
Just pick the ace and you win.
Just like I said.
Pick this guy. You lose.
I shuffle. And that's it. Pick.
One thousand!
Small bets only.
- One thousand!
- What. You find a wallet?
Have a seat.
Let's see what I've got in here.
Here's a thousand.
If you pick this one. You win.
This one. You lose.
This one. You lose.
I shuffle. And that's it.
Pick one!
You lose. Buddy!
You lose!
Where's your thousand?
Hey! Stop him!
Thief!
Give me a cigarette. Brother.
What. Those assholes
think I stole a thousand?
They haven't seen anything yet.
Just you wait.
Right.
You realize
you're sitting on a treasure?
What?
This arena makes loads
of money on Sundays.
- Get it?
- Yeah.
Long live the wrestlers.
This is a great day for Senegal.
Long-standing ties
bind France and Senegal.
Our greatest champions
are risking their titles today
with the noble aim ofhelping us
make our contribution
towards the construction
of the General De Gaulle Memorial.
This is a big event.
All of the elders, men, women
and children are here today.
All the important people are here.
Hey. Isn't he that same guy?
You're right. That's him.
He won't be stopping anyone today.
He's got a whole pack of cigarettes.
Which trunk do you think the money is in?
- The green one on top.
- The green one?
No. The blue one on the bottom.
That's why they put the others on top.
- I'd bet on the green one.
- Don't you contradict me.
I'm the boss man here.
It's the blue one.
Let's grab it and go.
Our greatest champions
are risking their titles today

of the General De Gaulle Memorial.
Good old De Gaulle.
His memorial can wait.
This beats everything.
Paris, here I come!
You street-sweeping niggers,
you city nigger.
I'm not one of you.
Can't mess with me, 'cause I'll be in Paris.
The Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame,
the Champs-Elysées, the L 'Arc de Triomphe.
I'm the one.
If this happens,
I'll be in with the big boys.
These guys here don't know
who they're messing with.
What a surprise. Brother!
You. A cop?
You know the other night
right after you left.
The place was raided.
I only got away because
I was outside pissing.
Scram! We've never met.
Don't mess up my career.
Smart ass.
Miss. As much as
I welcome your company.
Which of these fine houses is yours?
Drive on. We're going to my second home.
My maison de campagne.
This doesn't look so good.
All those cats.
Are you sure this is the right way?
Miss, how could you live here?
This place is creepy.
I'll drop you off
and go on my way.
This place gives me the creeps.
Don't you have a husband?
You must be brave to live here.
God help us.
God save us from places like this.
This is a bad place.
Dear God.
Aren't you from Senegal?
Only Europeans could live like this.
Hey. Iook at that wreck.
If I had tools. I'd fix it.
And we'd split for Paris.
Stop dreaming about that.
Not even an angel could do it.
I got it!
You see all the way down there?
You turn right.
And there's this huge guy
who lives over there.
He's got a nice house.
I met him at Mapenda's place.
A real good one.
Let's go pay him a visit.
But before we do that.
I've got to go take a crap.
You're the man.
Whatever you say.
Oh. It's Mory.
Go on!
Sit here. Mory.
You go join the women. Go on.
Thejoy oflove
Lasts but a moment
But heartbreak
Lasts a lifetime
I abandoned everything
For the fair Sylvie
Yet she abandoned me
And found another
Thejoy oflove
Mory. Have a seat.
Make yourself at home.
This is my villa.
Whatever you wish is yours.
You'll be the most gorgeous
at dinner tonight.
And just in time to drink
at the wellspring of happiness.
Mory. As you know.
I'm not jealous.
But who's that short-haired chick?
A broad's got better things to do
than hang around here.
Undress! I'll rub your back.
The water's not right.
Put your body and soul
in your friend Charlie's care.
They call me Charlie the cook.
That boy you just saw.
He's my number four boy.
When he arrived.
He was skinny as a rat.
Look at him now.
I take care of him.
Give him massages.
Cook for him.
Make him happy.
So you want to go to France?
Sweetheart. France
isn't what she used to be.
When I was there.
That's when France was great.
Champs-Elysées. Pigalle.
Montparnasse.
Mory. The water's great.
Mory. How's your back?
Let me wash it for you.
I'll show you who I am.
The water's nice.
I'll show you what I'm like.
The water's nice.
Come here.
The master says you're to take us.
Hurry up.
Here comes a griot
from the M'bai family
Today you'll know the man
You'll know the best praise singer
I won't bow to any wrestler
God has granted
this wrestler the power
God has granted him the power
One attacked my right side
I beat him down
Another attacked my left side
I beat him down
Another one came from behind
I beat him down
Here comes a griot
from the M'bai family
Another came from the front
I beat him down
If I do battle
I have to win
Griot M'bai
You shine like gold
The others are only silver
The country's champions
all crumble under my hands
Lady of the blue mouth
Your champion is here
Lady of the blue mouth
Your champion is here
The drummer comes out
to my house in the morning
Hey, here's Mory
The prodigal son is back
The prince doesn't forget his subjects
Your father rode across the savannas
Mory, you can hold your head up high
Your mother watered the ocean
Shame will never come because of you
The vultures, the hyenas won't succeed
A feast then for the prodigal son
Here I am before you
I'll be with you to the end
Let the drums beat
Mory, you remain our chosen,
our favorite friend
Mory, you remain our chosen,
our favorite friend
Mory, you, Mory of our hearts
Mory, son of the savanna
Mory, answer me
Tell me, Mory
Say yes, Mory
The prince said yes to me
It won't surprise you
The sky is clear now
Mory said yes to me
Hello? Central Police Station?
Is Sergeant Blanchet there?
He's out?
How about Mr. Thioye?
He's out?
Is anybody in?
Give me the division commander. Please.
Oh. He's in.
Tell him it's Charlie. Yes.
Is that you. Mambety?
How are you?
Inspector Mambety.
You're an ingrate.
You made me a promise.
And then you disappeared.
Promises. Promises.
But that's not what I'm calling about.
It's business.
I'm calling...
because somebody ripped me off.
He wanted to go to Europe.
He wanted money. He came to me.
I wanted to help him out.
You know me. A regular Pygmalion.
You know. I always help the kids.
He came in. I was taking a shower.
And he stole all my clothes.
Then left!
Anyway. He's easy to recognize.
He's tall. Messy hair.
Iooks like a hippie.
He's with a girl
who's got messed up hair too.
They stole one of my cars.
The all-American classic
with stars and stripes.
I don't remember the licence number.
No.
But they're very hungry.
I'm sure you can find them at a restaurant
or a travel agency
because they love money.
Don't look-
Yes.
He wants to leave.
I'm counting on you.
Okay. I'll make a statement.
Why don't you come over
to take it down. Sweetheart?
I got some first-class whiskey.
You'll come? Okay.
See you tonight.
Here you are. Miss.
I hope you'll have a lovely trip.
Please call again.
Say. Miss.
Haven't I seen you somewhere?
Must have been New York.
PORT OF DAKAR
NO ENTRYWITHOUT AUTHORIZATION
This city's rough.
"No Entry'"signs to the right.
"No Entry'"signs to the left.
A man with a club on every corner.
All because of too many debts.
But I've got to go.
Debt never killed anybody.
Honestly, debt never killed anybody.
Let's go.
Could you take me to the port?
The guy's been waiting for me
at the corner all day 'cause I owe him.
Look. It's Margot.
You're always on some scam.
Drive on. Chauffeur.

The Ancerville
will sail at 4:00 p.m.
Mao Tse-tung is soft.
What China needs -
I told my pupils on the first day.
"Your job is to kick out
the neocolonialists who I represent."
We've taught in Dakar for seven years.
The Italian communist
party is too extreme.
We never left Dakar.
What is there in Senegal?
Barren. Intellectually as well.
Our salary is three times
that of their teachers.
But they don't eat as we do.
They're unrefined.
And what would we
buy here. Masks?
African art is a joke made up
by journalists in need of copy.
We bank half our annual salary.
Not that we stint ourselves.
America needs austerity
to improve its economy.
I invested a decent sum...
in a bona fide business in Nice.
When we left this morning.
Our house boy threatened to leave
unless he had a 1.500-CFA raise.
After all we've done for him!
They're just big children.
They have no heart.
I abandoned everything
For the fair Sylvie
She abandoned me
And found another
Mr. Diop is requested
to see the captain at once.
Is he still alive?
He's losing blood.
Looks really bad.
Did you know it?
It was a handsome beast.
