Good evening, ladies and gentlemen...
and welcome once again
to The Crazy Daisy Show.
We have sophisticated entertainment,
a window into reality...
a breath of cold air
from another world.
As the Chastity Belt Foundation
and the Aristotlese Aplanalp chain stores...
proudly present the semifinalists
in the Miss World 1984 Contest!
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me a great deal of pleasure...
to present Mrs. Martha Aplanalp,
well-known philanthropist...
and chairman of
the Chastity Belt Foundation.
A great sponsor and a great mother.
[Applause]
** [Drums Beating ]

- [Drums Continue]
[Applause Increases ]
[Applause Stops ]
Dear Mrs. Martha, first the question,
why the Chastity Belt Foundation?
Surely in these modern times
that seems to be a bit old-fashioned.
Oh, we're not old-fashioned -
not in the least.
At Chastity Belt,
there are no metals...
no elastic supports...
no tranquilizers.
Through the guidance
of our sensational method...
your own body kills the animal.
We advocate simple triumph of the will.
It is painless and ever so rewarding.
No wild dreams.
No - No peculiar behavior.
Solid health and purposeful direction.
It's so good to hear about health
and purposeful direction in these sick times.
- Right on! Sock it to me, baby.
- [Audience Chuckles ]
A network of muscles forms the protective
armor around the pelvic region.
If not controlled and kept at bay...
wild impulses will turn everyone
into beastly animals...
chaotic natural beings.
Semifinalists from 77 countries have been
selected and sent here this evening.
They are, of course,
the most desirable, prominent...
and well-preserved virgins available.
This year's stake for the lucky
young winner is $50 billion.
Fifty billion dollars,
the estimated fortune of Mr. Aplanalp...
uh, Mrs. Martha Aplanalp's boy,
her pride and joy.
The richest bachelor in the world...
who decided suddenly this summer
to give up his bachelorhood...
to sponsor the Miss World Contest
and marry the winner...
the most cherished girl
on the planet Earth.
There's a saying in the Aplanalp family:
"When we buy something,
we buy the best, and we buy it brand-new."
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Mittlefinger.
[Audience Cheering, Applauding ]
Turn over here, Doctor.
Yes, uh, Dr. Mittlefinger
certainly is an extraordinary man.
Um, has to his credit
the delivery of three army generals...
four members of Parliament,
Eskimo sextuplets, uh...
and, of course,
many, many more people... and women.
I, uh - I'm really thrilled to be able
to perform at this important function...
and, uh, I'm anticipating
some delightful specimens.
Each new flower
brings a new joy, a new excitement.
- [Clears Throat ]
- Can we start the show?
[Announcer] Of course.
Uh, so let's meet now the first contestant...
Miss Southern Rhodesia.
- [Applause, Cheering ]
- [ Drums Beating ]
Another historical moment,
a window into reality...
an event never attempted
live on television before...
and coming to you
on The Crazy Daisy Show.
If you'll just step up here.
[Drums Continue]
[Mittlefinger] Would you be
good enough to remove your pants?
Oh, my pleasure.
- Dr. Mittlefinger-
- So kind.
brilliant master of deep insights
and even deeper insights.
Innovative explorer of
the abysses of the human body and soul.
Tell us, Miss, uh, Southern Rhodesia.
Tell us, how do you feel now?
Oh, I'm great. Oh!
[Giggling ]
[Martha ]
What's happening?
You're tickling me.
[Giggling ]
I'm really sensitive.
You're tickling me with your little light.
This little light.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
we proudly present Miss Congo.
- [Applause]
- [Drums Continue]
- [Cheering, Whistling ]
- [Applause Continues ]
Remove your panties please, honey.
Hey, baby. You mean my bananas?
Oh, yes, of course. Delicious.
There are different types of hymen,
a delicate little piece of skin...
that informs us about a girl's initiation
into the world of adult pleasures.
[Martha clears throat ]
I mean the sinful,
disgusting pleasures of the flesh...
and unusual sensual...
excitation.
[Drums Continue]
[Applause]
[Announcer] Now, here comes
Miss Yugoslavia, a picture of radiant health.
[Cheering, Whistling ]
Yes, well, this young lady
is certainly self-assured.

[No Audible Clapping]
Would you take your pants off, please?
I don't wear any.
[Mittlefinger]
You never wear any pants?
Not for a special occasion like this.
[Drums Continue]
Splendid. Splendid.
[Mademoiselle Canada ]
By far the most beautiful thing here.
In all my years of practice,
I've never seen anything so sweet.
A rosebud.

[Man, In English ]
When I buy something, I always buy the best.
You know,yesterday,
I bought a diamond mine in South Africa.
Today, another buy.
[Laughs ]
The best-bred bride available.
Must be about 7 85 diamonds in there.
You know that?
- About that?
- Oh, yeah. Maybe more.
And they all came from
my diamond mine.
Yeah!
[Laughing ]
Yes, sir, baby.
Here we go.
[Vocalizing: William Tell Overture ]
Yeah. Hand-carved.
- You know who this fella is?
- No.
That's Karl. Karl Marx!
[Laughing ]
Yeah.
He's the guy that shot the Russian czar. Yeah.
Shot him dead, right in the head. Yeah.
That started World War I, honey. Yeah!
[Mr. Dollars] I got it from
a Russian business connection. Yeah.
He buys a lot of my diamonds.
- You see that little fountain down there?
- [Mademoiselle Canada ] Yes.
[Mr. Dollars]
That's my next buy. YeahI
It's gonna be my biggest undertaking
in landscape architecture.
I'm gonna buy it
from the Canadian government.
I'm gonna renovate it,
redecorate it.
Get rid of the water, turn off the falls.
[Laughs]
I'm gonna install
an electronic, synthetic...
laser moving image in livin' color.
In livin' color, honey! Yeah.
And we're gonna have
a huge quadraphonic sound system.

Now, you may ask,
do I have time for marriage?
And I simply state that marriage is

- which is money!
- [ All Cheering ]
I have come to understand
the real meaning of marriage.
I simply can't afford any more waste.
I can't afford any more chaos in my sex life.
[ Laughs ]
All right. Everyone has to relieve himself,
but why waste it?
Okay. You bang some broad,
you feel good for a half a second...
but then you realize you've gotta
run to the phone to call your doctor...
'cause you gotta have a V.D. test.
You soothe your balls...
and you get a headache.
- That's right, my son.
- Well, not for me no more.
I guarantee that.
My mama kept telling me,
''Son, look after your health.''
[ Chuckles ]
Well, Ma, I sure as hell aim to.
Come over here, honey.
Best little heifer in town. In the world!
[ Laughs ]
No chemical substitutes.

Well, I done it.

I expected something else to happen.
Nonsense. He can do anything. He's the most
powerful millionaire in the world.
Which means, quite simply, that for your own
good, you better forget this marriage.
Then I think I should get alimony.
I advise you strongly...
to refrain from thinking anything.
Thinking sometimes
can be a very dangerous exercise.
Very dangerous indeed.
Hmm. This is insane.
Yes.
Maybe we should ask for
a psychiatric examination.
There are people with similar symptoms.
They become confused.
They spend the rest of their lives
behind the walls of asylums.

Sugar is dangerous.
[ Luv, In French ]
Makes you live dangerously.
Are you afraid of the past?
[ In Polish ]
I brought all this sugar here,
but the bitter taste
still lingers.
[ In French ]
In any case, the traces can't be erased.
[ In Polish ]
What about the witnesses?
The witnesses must disappear.

[ Both Moaning Softly ]
Oh.
[ In French ]
That's good.
Go on.
[ In Polish ]
No explanation?

[ Man, In English ] Darling, this is
going to be the highlight of your career.
From now on,
when people eat chocolate-
I mean the brand we advertise-
they will not feel the same.
I want them to feel
as they're eating you.
[ Man ]
Action.
[ Man ]
Chocolat.
[ Man, In French ]
Easy, easy.
Perfect.
Perfect. Very beautiful.
- [ In English ] Okay.
- [ Man, In French ] Sensational!

Okay.

Mmm. Right.
We're gonna sell the chocolate.

Beautiful.
Beautiful.

Let everything be known...
and let everything be clean.

[ Martha, In English ] Our scouts
had trouble in certain parts of the world.
It's not easy to find a girl
who's both pretty and a virgin.
Our boys did quite a job, I'll tell you.
