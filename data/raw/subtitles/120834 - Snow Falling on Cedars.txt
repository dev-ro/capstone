- Move it up.
- Is this right?
Yeah, yeah.
- We're not supposed to take these.
- Don't worry about it.
- Just get the net in.
- I don't think you're...
Oh, Jesus.
We're not pulling
at the same time.
What? Jesus!
Did any more of you guys see Carl
at Ship Channel Bank last night?
- Why do you want to know?
- To see if somebody talked to him.
Fish went sour on me when the fog
rolled in. I got out of there.
We got Ferry, Hartwell,
Molton, Miyamoto.
- Anybody else?
- Japs.
I figured you'd have heard by now.
All right, if you see
any of these guys...
Art's starting to sound
like a real sheriff.
I think this was just an accident.
Of course it is,
but a man's dead, William.
I've gotta write my report.
Guys.
Chambers, tell me...
I'm not gonna pick up
your newspaper...
and read some article
about an investigation, am I?
- You want me to lie?
- No, I wanna be off the record.
That's what I want.
I mean, if there's a killer,
why would you want 'em all alerted?
- So it is a murder investigation?
- I didn't say that.
Hatsue?
You all right?
Go away, Ishmael.
- Look, I just wanted to tell you...
- Go away.
There you go, Miyamoto.
Sir.
Sir, just a minute.
Morning, Kazuo.
I've come to get you off.
- Good morning, sir.
- Counselor.
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.
Looks like we have
a good turnout.
How about that jury?
What a bunch of yokels.
Have you seen
the Silent Review rag?
Guy writes like this trial is
the biggest thing ever happened.
Why is this news in Seattle?
Because he's a Jap.
Simple as that.
Hey, take a look at that.
Would you tell us, please,
Sheriff...
what was your first impression...
as you and your deputy inspected
the Susan Marie...
that fateful September morning?
Mainly, how quiet it was
out there...
and things just didn't add up.
- "Add up"? What do you mean?
- A fisherman drowned. It happens.
But Carl Heine...
I got to thinking,
he was so meticulous.
He did everything
right by the darn book.
Every single light is on, Art,
and his net's out.
- I got a bad feeling about this.
- Don't say that, Abel.
Don't even think like that.
Jesus.
There's nothing in the hold, Art,
apart from fish.
You wanna pull up the net?
So looking at the evidence there...
you determined
this was no accident.
Well, no, I didn't determine
much of anything at first.
I just kept wondering what
I was gonna say to his family.
I mean, after all, I knew the guy.
I knew his wife and children and...
- Hey, men.
- Hi.
- Is your mother home?
- She's inside.
Go on and play now.
- Right in there.
- Okay.
Susan Marie?
Come in!
I'll be right down!
Hey. What can I do for you, Art?
Carl's not home yet.
That's why l...
That's why I'm here.
I'm afraid I've got
some very bad news to tell you.
The worst kind of news.
Carl died last night
out at Ship Channel Bank.
Carl's just fine.
I found him, Susan Marie.
I found him tangled in his net.
I knew this would happen.
I warned him.
Well, Sheriff, you said
there was no sign of a struggle.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
Well, as I said...
with a fella
as particular as Carl...
there were a couple of things
that struck me as odd, yeah.
You mentioned the coffee cup
on the floor.
Was there anything else
out of place?
There was a dead battery
just lying around...
and the cover to the battery well
didn't fit right.
A battery cover that didn't fit.
- What did you make of that?
- Objection.
Asking the witness to speculate.
Gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to
object every time you did that?
That's quite enough horseplay.
Try and act your age.
If I did that, Your Honor,
I'd be dead.
- Proceed, gentlemen.
- There's an objection, Your Honor.
And it's overruled.
You may answer the question.
I looked under the lid...
and one of the batteries
was bigger than the other.
Didn't that also strike you
as odd that he would have...
a battery that didn't fit...
a man as particular as Carl?
Oh, yeah.
No, I wondered.
But he'd done some
on-the-spot work, you see.
And the flange was
kind of banged away...
to make room for the one
that was too big.
Would this "too big" battery
have fit, say...
Kazuo Miyamoto's battery?
It was the exact same type
as Miyamoto's, that's for sure.
But, he had both
of his batteries in...
when we searched his boat
later on, so l...
When you fall off a motorcycle,
the injuries look different.
Now, in this case,
the injury had been inflicted...
by a long, narrow,
flat object.
Like a fishing gaff, for example?
That's very possible.
- Yeah.
- Now, you say...
it was a laceration...
- Two-and-a-half inches long...
- He was hit hard.
over the left ear.
- Wanna play Sherlock Holmes?
- The bone under it...
fractured over a four-inch area.
- What would've caused that?
- I'll tell you what...
a head wound like this
puts me in mind of.
I've seen wounds
exactly like this...
many times in the war.
Have you seen this specific kind
of wound before?
Frequently, as a result of
hand-to-hand combat...
with Jap soldiers.
I even told Art, "You wanna
play Sherlock Holmes...
Look for a Jap
with a bloody gun butt."
What led you to that conclusion?
I've seen these kendo wounds
many times, exactly like this one.
Could you tell us
what kendo is?
Kendo is
Japanese stick fighting.
They train as kids, you know,
to kill with sticks.
No further questions.
Thank you.
Your report states it was death
by drowning, not a kendo.
How did you determine this?
As I've already testified, I found
foam in the deceased's lungs.
Yes, this foam.
I'm not sure I understand
about this, Horace.
What would cause that again?
It occurs when water, mucus and air
are mixed by respiration.
Breathing, that is.
I believe I said that.
But you can see
why I'm confused.
Because a drowned person
doesn't breathe, so...
Of course not. The foam means
that he went in breathing.
That's why the autopsy report shows
drowning as the cause of death.
I see. Meaning that...
he wasn't murdered first,
say on the deck of the boat...
- And then thrown overboard.
- Well, you can always...
Thank you, Horace.
That's important. That's good.
But there's something else
I'd like to ask you about.
Something in your report.
Go ahead, ask.
About the wound
to the deceased's head.
You say here...
that it was made by a long,
narrow, flat object.
Is that what you saw,
or it is just your inference?
It's my job to infer. That's what
coroners do... we infer.
That's my area of expertise...
inference.
Of course it is.
Of course, Horace.
Can you infer, then,
whether an object was propelled...
against the head
of the deceased...
or if his head moved against
an object...
or would both look the same?
The same.
So if the head struck something
narrow and flat...
like the gunnel of the boat
or net roller, a fairlead...
could that have happened?
If a head were moving fast enough,
but I don't see how it could be.
Nonetheless, it is possible?
Sir, anything's possible.
Is it fair to say that you don't
know for certain which it was?
Look, didn't I just say...
- I already said that.
- But you are certain...
that he died by drowning?
For the third time, yes.
Can I say something here?
No, thank you, Horace.
You've been more than helpful.
- No further questions.
- The witness may stand down.
We'll take our lunch recess now.
Reconvene at 1:30 sharp.
How are the kids?
They made a snowman
to welcome you home.
Wow, that's great.
Anyway, just a few more days.
You look beautiful.
I'm not going until you smile.
I think it's dangerous
with this jury.
I'm sorry I kissed you
on the beach.
Let's just forget about it.
Forget it happened.
Don't be sorry.
I'm not.
Me neither.
Do you think this is wrong?
Your friends would.
Your dad would kill me.
My mom is the problem.
Stay away from white boys.
Marry one of your own kind
whose heart is strong and gentle.
The hairpin should be
better placed...
for a girl to find
the right husband.
She teaches me to beJapanese.
What does that mean?
Dances, calligraphy,
how to do my hair...
how to sit without moving.
What's the point of that?
It's a part of grace.
You boys don't understand.
Try me.
She doesn't let me
get away with anything.
It's the same for me...
except it's my dad.
Know what would happen
to an operator...
who got his sleeve caught
in the press, huh?
Do you?
He'd be popped open like a balloon,
splattered all over the walls.
Even his bones
would disappear...
to be discovered later on the floor
like strips of white confetti.
to be discovered later on the floor
like strips of white confetti.
We'll make a newspaperman
out of you yet.
Hey, James!
Did you ever wonder why
the Strawberry Princess...
- Is always a Japanese girl?
- Not really.
I'm sure your father
will explain it to you anyway.
It's sort of an unwitting
virgin sacrifice.
A concept of racial harmony,
you know...
and for a while
it seems to work.
- That's the Fujita girl, isn't it?
- No, that's Hatsue Imada.
Oh, yes, she's lovely.
Mrs. Heine...
you were acquainted...
with the defendant
and his family, were you not?
Ja. Him and his folks
worked our land.
They lived in one of our cabins
at first.
So, the defendant knew
the deceased, your son, even then?
They fished together.
They went to school.
My boy Carl treated him...
like a white person...
just like any friend.
So tell us, Mrs. Heine,
where did things go wrong?
My husband went and sold...
his father
seven acres of our land.
That fence to that fence
and then down to the road.
- That's seven acres, yeah?
- No.
Where, to the edge
of the mountain?
All right.
All right, all right, all right,
you drive a hard bargain.
And that's where
all this trouble started.
But how can this be, hmm...
since we all know
that it is against the law...
for Japanese born
to own land?
Even leasing is illegal.
So now, what was the point
of this payment plan?
Their kids was born here.
So, when the oldest...
that one there, was 20...
and last payment gets made,
he could own it.
But they missed their last
two payments, so that was that.
They missed
their last two payments...
after years
of not missing one?
It was the war.
They were gone.
They were sent off
to the camps...
with all the other Japs.
We must leave everything.
If you like, work our fields.
Sell berries, keep money.
Otherwise it will rot. Today I have
half money for next payment.
Absolutely not. I'm not going
to take your savings.
You take money. $ 125.
I will send more
from where I'm going.
If not enough, sell my seven acres
of berries, keep money.
I thought
you was giving us those.
Didn't you come in here
giving them away?
Now you want to make up
the other half in berries...
you expect us
to tend and pick?
Is that what you come here
hoping for?
You want more coffee?
No, thank you.
Take money.
Etta has been rude to you.
For that I apologize.
Keep this money.
As payment,
we'll work out...
So the arrangement was,
those payments would be made...
- Somewhere down the road.
- Somewhere down the road.
The road ended
when my husband passed away.
I couldn't run the farm
by myself...
so I sold...
all 30 acres
to Ole Jurgenson.
For a fair price this time.
And I sent back their equity...
to those Japs down to that camp
in California...
which I didn't have to do.
So they got all their money back?
That was that...
or did you hear from
the defendant's family again?
Oh, yes, I heard from them.
I heard from that one there.
That one sitting there
just showed up at my door.
Carl's overseas.
He's fighting the Japs.
- What is it you want?
- I came to get our land back.
It isn't yours.
It's Ole Jurgenson's now.
Talk to him.
I just did. He didn't know
it was our land.
You didn't tell him
Mr. Heine promised my father...
I'm supposed to tell him there's
some illegal contract...
muddling things up?
You people didn't make
your payments.
In America, the bank comes in
and repossesses your land.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Nothing illegal.
Wrong is a different matter.
Get out.
You took advantage of the fact
that we were gone.
You sold the land from under us
while I was fighting the Nazis.
Your witness.
Just three questions.
The Miyamoto family
bought your seven acres...
for $4,500?
They tried to. They defaulted
on their payments.
Second question:
What did Ole Jurgenson
pay you per acre?
A thousand.
I guess that makes
what would have been $4,500...
into $ 7,000, doesn't it?
So if you sent the equity back,
you had a profit...
of $2,500?
- Is that your third question?
- It is.
You've done your math right.
You too, Mrs. Heine.
No further questions.
You may step down, Mrs. Heine.
Before we adjourn for the day,
there's one more thing.
This court take judicial notice
of the fact that tomorrow...
is the ninth anniversary
of the attack on Pearl Harbor...
which has no relationship
whatsoever to this trial.
Which is why I mention it.
9:30 tomorrow morning.
Stay warm.
They plowed clear out to the point.
What's the big attraction?
I'm checking lighthouse records
to see if it's...
the biggest snowstorm
in island history.
Where were you in '29?
That was a snowstorm.
- Real blizzard.
- Is that right?
If you don't believe me,
check the coast guard records.
There should be a story in it.
Scribble, scribble, while the rest
of us have to work for a living.
Always a pleasure, Dave.
Everything's dated.
We do things by dates mainly.
Radio transmissions,
shipping logs, weather reports.
The whole nine yards.
Those stacks go clear back to Noah.
Not that anyone ever
pays them any mind.
You monitor all radio activity?
Fishermen, that sort of thing?
Pretty much.
Anything significant anyway.
Some of these guys
don't know when to shut up.
Well, just yell if you need me.
Left is this.
This is right.
Your move.
Correcting course
via Ship Channel Bank.
If this is correct...
Pilot relays position...
At 1:48 a.m., SS West Corona made a
corrective dogleg to the northwest.
Ship's navigator took
three insurance readings.
Hey, Levant?
Here's the shipping channel.
Any freighter off course
can dogleg back through here.
But that only happens
if we're really socked in.
Don't the gill-netters
work off this bank?
Not even they're crazy enough
to hang around in a bad fog.
They get out.
What's this got to do
with your snowstorm story?
Nothing.
Just curious, that's all.
Doesn't make him guilty.
- This island ought to be ashamed.
- It's not as simple as that.
I followed every second of it.
The evidence sounds very solid.
This prosecutor has his facts
all lined up.
You haven't heard
the defense case yet.
You sound as if
you're ready to hang him.
Besides, you can't depend
on facts, not by themselves.
What else is there?
Emotions?
Facts you can cling to.
Emotions just float away.
Then let them.
I love you.
You smell like cedar.
So do you.
I can hear your heart beating.
Dear Ishmael...
I can't think of anything
more painful...
than writing this letter to you.
I feel I have to tell you
the truth.
I know it's late.
I went by the lighthouse...
and I found
a report that stated...
Just came across some information.
It may be relevant to Kazuo's case.
I went by the lighthouse
and found a report that stated...
a giant freighter passed through
at the exact time that Carl died.
I think it's something
that should have been discussed.
I love you.
Not just Hawaii. They're
attacking all over the Pacific.
The whole fleet's destroyed.
The FBI is in Seattle now,
arresting Jap traitors.
Spies and everything.
The defense commissioner
reckons anything can happen.
There'll be a blacklist.
These people are our neighbors.
Make sure you paper up
your windows.
So the Japs won't find us.
They've sent their sons
to the United States Army.
They're no more an enemy...
than our fellow islanders
of German or Italian descent.
- You get the message?
- Mr. Lambertson?
We get the message.
Let us live that when it is over we
can look each other in the eye...
and know that we have
acted honorably.
Set that for me, would you?
Let us live...
that when it is over...
we can look each other...
in the eye...
and know...
that we...
have acted...
honorably.
The FBI has arrested
Mr. Surosake...
and his family can't leave
their house.
Everything will be all right.
I promise.
We are loyal.
It's for our defense.
Everyone on the island
has these things.
They'll hold on to this stuff
for a little bit...
then ship it back to you...
nothing to worry about.
You folks have been
real polite.
Be out of your hair
in just a second.
That's very nice.
From the old country, it appears.
Very high-class.
These are real nice things.
They'll take special care of'em.
Any old-country stuff
we have to take.
Strawberry Princess, huh?
You must've been
flattered by that.
Hey, Crawford,
guess what was in the shed.
Dynamite.
Twenty-four sticks.
That's for tree stumps...
for clearing land.
Maybe, but this is still bad,
you see.
It's illegal contraband.
You're supposed to turn that in.
Now we've gotta arrest you
and bring you to Seattle.
We don't need those.
Mr. Imada-san is a class act,
a real gentleman.
You can't do this.
He's done nothing wrong.
Best for an honest man to clear
his name, for good and all.
Excuse me, would you mind?
- Journalism is the facts.
- Which facts?
You can't print them all.
Journalism is making choices.
Culling out what's unimportant.
You know what happens
to Jap lovers?
Jap lovers get their balls cut off
and shoved down their throats.
Better watch your step.
It's unbelievable to me.
I don't know, Mom.
The PTA honors 23 women.
Dad singles out three names
and they're all Japanese.
That's not journalism.
It's propaganda.
- This is dangerous, Arthur.
- It'll blow over.
Did you see the letters?
"Seems like you're favoring
the Japs, Art.
Your newspaper's an insult
to all white Americans.
- Please cancel my subscription."
- What are you gonna do?
Send him a refund.
What happened to the Petersen ad
I put together?
- They pulled out.
- So did the gas station.
And Larsen, and the cafe.
What now?
Print four pages
instead of eight.
"Please tell Somiko to help
her mother with the garden work.
We are digging trenches
for a water system.
I am folding and ironing
clothing in the laundry."
The hikujin, they are
no better than animals!
Not all of them.
How would you know?
Because I live here among them.
So do you!
You speak with great assurance.
- The words fly from your mouth.
- I don't care what you say.
Do you hear me?
I don't want to be Japanese!
Marry me, Hatsue.
Please say yes.
We'll leave here.
Are you crazy?
I want you to marry me.
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets'...
So, Dr. Whitman, sir,
you found...
blood on the gaff.
It was not fish blood at all.
It was human, yes?
- Type "B" positive.
- Carl Heine's type.
Yes, but you can't say with any
certainty that the blood was his.
No, but as I say...
the type is rare.
Ten percent of Caucasian males.
Whereas the defendant is type "O."
Yes, sir, you told us.
No one is contesting that.
But you also told us
that you scraped the dry blood...
from the handle of the...
An object was propelled against...
The State calls
Mrs. Susan Marie Heine.
Can you think back for me
to the morning of September 8?
The morning after
your husband...
purchased theJurgenson farm.
One week before his death.
Did the defendant come calling
that day...
to speak to your husband?
It's no big deal.
It's a long story.
He wants to buy seven
of Ole's acres.
The ones his family had.
You know that thing
my mother talks about?
Had a feeling it was that.
What did you tell him?
What could I tell him?
There's my mother to think about.
- You know her.
- Uh-huh.
I said I'd think it over,
and have a talk with you.
He go away angry?
I couldn't tell. Kazuo's a Jap.
You can't read Japs.
Don't say that.
You don't mean that.
You fished together.
You and he were friends.
We were kids then.
So your husband said
he'd think it over.
He encouraged Mr. Miyamoto
to believe he might...
l...
Well, I wouldn't say
encouraged.
But he didn't say no, did he?
He didn't say no hope existed.
Not in those words.
So, the defendant
was encouraged to hope.
How could anyone know what he hopes
for or anything else he's thinking?
But, Mrs. Heine.
- You really think that's fair?
- Objection!
- That's totally irrelevant.
- There's nothing more relevant!
- You know that as well as anybody.
- Your Honor.
Gentlemen, please!
Back to your corners.
Mrs. Heine, I'm very sorry
for this little interruption.
No further questions.
Thank you, Mrs. Heine.
You may step down.
The State rests, Your Honor.
Very well. Mr. Gudmundsson, the
defense may call its first witness.
The defense calls
Mrs. Hatsue Miyamoto.
My husband came home excited.
He woke me with the news.
He told me he helped Carl at sea.
And Carl had agreed
to sell us the land.
We started making plans
right away.
When did you first learn
that Carl Heine had drowned?
1:00 that afternoon...
from a clerk at Petersen's.
Kazuo? Kazuo?
- What is it?
- Carl Heine's dead.
It's all over the island.
- What do you mean?
- He drowned.
They found him in his net.
His poor wife and those kids.
I can't believe it.
How horrible.
Gotta get to the boat,
replace that battery.
What are you talking about?
I was on his boat
last night, remember?
Yeah, but you were helping him.
Tell the sheriff.
Are you kidding? You think
they're gonna believe me?
It's the truth, isn't it?
That's right.
Let's just leave it at that.
So, your husband came home
agitated...
after his encounter at sea
with the deceased?
I said "excited,"
not "agitated."
He was excited in the sense
of being overjoyed.
You were...
overjoyed yourself
to hear the news?
Happy for him,
and relieved.
So then you and your husband,
you must've called...
well, friends and relatives...
to tell them the happy news, yes?
No.
Really?
You didn't call your mother, your
sisters about starting a new life?
Your husband never tells his family
the family honor's been vindicated?
No.
We decided not
to tell anyone...
until we signed papers
in case something went wrong.
Then something did.
Carl Heine was found dead...
with his head crushed.
Yes. And then,
what was there to call about?
Everything was up in the air.
"Up in the air."
Was that your reaction?
So, apart from your concern
about a land deal evaporating...
what was your reaction...
to the news that a husband and
father to small children was dead...
with his skull bashed in?
If you mean to imply that we
didn't care about Carl's death...
that is wrong and insulting.
I see. I see. Then did it
occur to you to come forward...
and tell Sheriff Moran what you knew
about this encounter in the fog?
The dead battery, was it?
We discussed that,
and decided not to.
Why not?
Because things looked bad.
Very bad!
Kazuo and I knew that.
We thought he could end up here
on trial for murder.
And that's exactly
what has happened.
But if truth was on your side,
whatever were you worried about?
Trials aren't only about truth,
Mr. Hooks...
even though they should be.
So you hid the truth deliberately.
You lied, didn't you?
We were afraid to come forward.
Seemed like a mistake.
Doesn't it seem to you that your
mistake was in being deceitful...
and deliberately
concealing information...
during the course
of a sheriff's investigation?
It seems human to me.
I suppose you mean that
somehow excuses your lies?
I don't know, Mrs. Miyamoto.
I just...
I don't understand.
I'm completely at a loss.
How on earth can you expect
any of us to believe you now?
Question withdrawn,
Your Honor.
Wait a minute!
I haven't had a chance.
No further questions.
That's enough, Mrs. Miyamoto.
Not another word.
The fact that you wish to give
Mr. Hooks a piece of your mind...
that just isn't allowed,
Mrs. Miyamoto.
Very well. Mr. Gudmundsson,
will you redirect...
Under the circumstances,
we will adjourn early.
9:30 tomorrow.
This is a very fine car.
Much better than the new ones.
Well, it was my father's.
He was a good man.
I know it's caused you trouble,
but the snow's beautiful, isn't it?
Yes, very beautiful.
This trial is unfair.
Your father would have written
about that in his paper.
What would he have said?
How this trial is wrong!
The whole thing is unfair!
Sometimes I think unfairness...
is a part of things.
I'm not talking about
the whole universe.
I'm talking about people.
The coroner, that prosecutor.
You! You could do something
to help.
Is that what you think?
Maybe I should write an article.
About unfairness.
About all the unfair things
people do to each other.
Excuse me, Mrs. Chambers.
The Japanese people of the island
are saddened by this loss.
Your husband was a man of great
fairness and compassion for others.
A friend to us
and to all people.
We know you will follow
in his footsteps, Ishmael...
and honor his legacy.
Thank you.
You should stay the night.
- Don't drive back through this.
- I've got an early start.
This room is full
of ghosts, isn't it?
I hate to see you this way.
I don't know what you mean.
She's married, Ishmael.
Look, it's awfully cold in here.
Let's talk in the kitchen.
I don't wanna talk
about anything.
You're just like your father.
I'm not just like my father!
I know everyone wishes I was.
Whenever they look at me,
I hear them thinking...
"He's only half the man
his father was."
I was only going to say
he never minded the cold.
It's not such
a terrible thing...
being your father's son.
Well organized rhythm,
as the men of the dance band...
take over and start the air jumping
to the tune of "My Blue Heaven. "
Pardon us, Your Majesty.
Who's your lover boy?
Give it back!
Does this explain your eagerness
to walk in the woods every day?
Does it?
Answer me!
"Dear Ishmael...
I can't think of anything
more painful...
than writing this letter to you.
I feel I have
to tell you the truth.
When we met the last time
in the cedar tree...
and I felt your body move
against mine...
When we met the last time
in the cedar tree...
and I felt your body move
against mine...
I knew with certainty...
that everything was wrong.
I knew we could
never be right together...
and that soon
I would have to tell you so.
And now, with this letter...
I am telling you.
This is the last time
I'll write to you.
I'm not yours anymore.
I don't love you, Ishmael.
I can think of
no more honest way to say it.
When I heard
your heart beating...
as we lay together...
I felt closer to you
than I had ever been to anyone.
And I knew...
when I heard your heart beating.
This is the last time
I'll ever write to you.
I knew with certainty...
that everything was wrong.
I loved you.
And I didn't love you
at the same moment.
I can think of no more
honest way to say it.
I don't love you, Ishmael.
I knew it.
I can think of no more honest
way to say it. I loved you.
And I didn't love you
at the same moment.
I'm going to move on
with my life...
as best I can.
And I hope that you will too.
I don't love you, Ishmael.
I can think of
no more honest way to say it.
Whenever we were together,
I knew it.
I loved you.
And I didn't love you
at the same moment.
You must have.
I must say good-bye to you.
I know you will do great things
in this world.
You have a gentle heart.
A good heart.
I will never forget you...
and the time we spent together.
Scissors.
Retractor.
A clamp.
Fuckin' Jap bitch.
- Are they gonna send you to Europe?
- I think so.
Why did you have to volunteer?
They'll hear everything.
Wouldn't some music be nice?
Have you ever done this before?
Never.
You're my only.
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?
I do.
I heard an air horn
and saw a lantern in the fog.
- Is that you, Miyamoto?
- And another one in Carl's hand.
What's up, Carl?
Both my batteries are drawed down.
The generator belts were loose.
Lantern and air horn's all I got.
I'm dead here.
No problem.
We'll pull one of my batteries
and get you started.
That thing's big, but it'll fit if
I bang the flange out of the way.
We can use this
to hammer with.
I cannot imagine why you kept
this story from the sheriff.
Why?
I didn't have a lawyer.
Even after you had an attorney,
you still claimed to know nothing.
You claim not
to have seen Carl.
- Am I correct?
- Yes, initially.
Well.
"Initially." That's an interesting
word. You'd been arrested.
You had a lawyer.
You still claimed ignorance.
I should've told everything right
away. I wouldn't be here if I had.
"Should've told everything."
Meaning you should've told
the truth.
But is that the truth?
The whole truth?
Is it?
You don't wanna hear
the whole truth.
Why don't you try me?
The whole truth is,
I wanted to kill him.
But did you?
Nothing to say?
It'll take me a while
to charge up.
We'll catch up on the dock.
Nothing to say?
- I didn't know that was a question.
- Oh, my apologies.
- You regret not telling the truth?
- I have told the truth.
You mean this morning. The battery
story. That one is the truth?
- That's a question, sir.
- Yes.
And I told it
long before this morning.
You said in
your testimony that...
"I slept until 1:30 when my wife
woke me with the news.
We talked for a while,
then I went straight to my boat."
You didn't go anywhere else.
Just straight to your boat.
- Is that the truth?
- Yes.
Well, the sheriff found
two batteries in your well.
lf, as you claim,
you left one with Carl.
- How's that possible?
- I had a spare battery in my shed.
I brought it down and put it in
just before the sheriff showed up.
Conveniently, in your shed.
Why does the battery story change
every time a new question's raised?
You asked me if I went straight to
the boat. I did, with the battery.
And the new line too?
Was that in your shed?
You have a regular chandlery
in there?
When you have no answer, you sit
in silence with no expression?
You're a hard man
to trust, sir.
Objection!
Sustained.
You know better than that.
Either ask questions that count
for something or sit down.
Shame on you.
No further questions.
Believing that Etta Heine's son...
would never sell him the land...
land that in his mind,
belonged to his family...
his only chance to get that land
would be to eliminate Carl Heine.
Thus believing
that cold-blooded murder...
was justified,
he trailed Carl Heine...
Left before striking
the treacherous blow...
he had been trained to strike
by his father's hand.
After a series of lies,
the defendant at last...
admits he was there,
alone on the boat, in the fog.
Carl Heine's blood
on his fishing gaff.
Seven acres.
I just wonder what you'd pay
for 'em. Just curious, is all.
- What are you selling 'em for?
- Did I say I was sellin'?
If I was, I guess I'd have
to figure you want 'em real bad.
I ought to charge
a small fortune, maybe.
All right,
I'm sorry about it, okay?
About the whole damn mess.
Twelve hundred an acre.
That's what I paid Ole.
You got no choice on that.
We'll sign off tomorrow.
Look clearly at the defendant.
See the truth
self-evident in him...
and in the facts of this case.
Look into his eyes,
ladies and gentlemen.
Consider his face.
Ask yourself...
each one of you...
"What is my duty as a citizen
of this community?
Of this country?
As an American?"
There's no evidence
of anger at Carl...
or much less rage,
or much less murderous rage.
No reason for premeditation.
No evidence of it anywhere.
He had asked his childhood friend
Carl to sell him some land.
Carl was considering it.
Carl's own wife testified...
that her husband
had not made up his mind.
A strange moment to follow
and kill a man.
Don't you think?
What Mr. Hooks asks you to believe
is that no proof is needed...
against a man
who bombed Pearl Harbor.
"Look at his face,"
the prosecutor said...
presuming that you will see
an enemy there.
He's counting on you
to remember this war...
and to see Kazuo Miyamoto...
as somehow connected with it.
Indeed he is!
Let us recall that First Lieutenant
Kazuo Miyamoto...
is a much decorated hero
of the United States Army.
Now...
Kazuo Miyamoto did
one thing wrong.
He wasn't certain
he could trust us.
He was afraid that he would be made
the victim of prejudice...
as Mr. Hooks, indeed...
is urging you to do.
And there's reason
in his uncertainty.
Why?
Well, we sent him
and his wife...
and thousands of Americans
to concentration camps.
They lost their homes,
their belongings, everything!
Should we now be unforgiving
of his mistrust?
Now...
our learned prosecutor will have
you do your duty as Americans.
Proud Americans.
And, of course, you must!
And if you do, Kazuo Miyamoto
has nothing to fear...
because this great country
is supposed to be founded...
on a set of principles
of fairness...
of equality and justice.
And if you are true
to these principles...
you'll only convict a man for what
he's done, and not for who he is.
I'm an old man.
I don't walk so well anymore.
One of my eyes is close
to useless.
My life is drawing
to a close.
Why do I say this?
I say this because it means
that I ponder matters...
in the light of death...
in a way that most of you do not.
And I feel like a traveler
descended from Mars...
astounded by what I see here.
The same human frailty...
passed on from generation
to generation.
We hate one another.
We are the victims...
of irrational fears,
of prejudice.
You might think...
that this is a small trial
in a small place.
Hmm? Well...
it isn't.
Every once in a while,
somewhere in the world...
humanity goes on trial...
and integrity...
and decency.
Every once in a while...
ordinary people just like you,
ladies and gentlemen...
get called on to give the report
card for the human race.
In the name of humanity,
do your duty as jurors.
Return this man
to his wife and children.
Set him free...
as you must.
Good night, Mrs. Miyamoto.
Please.
I know you'll think
this is crazy.
But all I want to do
is hold you...
and I think that if you'll let me
do that just for a few seconds...
I can walk away...
and never speak to you again.
Hatsue, can you please
look at me?
I did a terrible thing,
Ishmael.
But you have to hear this.
I can never touch you.
You have to let go.
That's the way things are.
Things end, Ishmael.
They do.
You have to let go.
I went by the lighthouse,
and I found a report...
that stated the freighter passed
through the Ship Channel Bank...
at the exact time
of Carl Heine's death.
Which is something that should
have been discussed at the trial.
I can't believe I let you
rope me into this.
God! We've been over
these boats a dozen times.
If there's a lantern on Carl's mast,
then Miyamoto's story's true.
See? No lantern.
- What are those?
- Nothing. Bits of twine.
Bits of twine aren't nothing.
Maybe somebody should take
a look at those.
Don't touch anything up there.
It's still a crime scene. Remember?
Don't ever touch something
at a crime scene.
Don't the phrase, "The jury's out"
mean anything to you?
They're lashings.
Figure-eight lashings
all cut through.
And you know something?
These stains here on the mast,
they could be blood.
The cut on his hand.
See this?
Art, I think you better
come down here.
- Something you should see.
- What the hell is it now?
- What?
- Take a look at this.
This better be good.
I can admit evidence if required
in the interest of justice.
Only if it changes everything.
- Nels explained that to you?
- Yes, he did.
Very well then. About this
second lantern and the freighter.
After Miyamoto left, and Carl's
engine was up and running...
he must have remembered the lantern,
so he climbs up to cut it down.
Everything fits:
the coast guard report...
the lanterns,
the freighter's course...
the coffee cup,
the time on Carl's watch...
and Carl's blood
on the fishing gaff.
Your Honor, that is
the rankest speculation.
Alvin, please spare me.
- With all due respect...
- You listen here!
We're going to hear
this theory out.
And if justice demands it, we're
gonna let the jury hear it too...
just in case
it might be the truth.
The head wound?
We found a small fracture
in the gunnel.
- Just below the mast.
- Anything could've caused that.
- Anything with human hair.
- Why?
May I?
This isn't a legal case.
There's no way to prove
any of this, Your Honor.
This certainly warrants
a fresh look.
I want to think about it.
By the way...
this coast guard report,
when did you come across it?
Was it today you went out
to the lighthouse?
Day before yesterday.
You're wondering why
I held on to it.
Perhaps I have some idea.
Could it have anything to do...
with the way
you look at her?
It takes a rare thing...
a turning point...
to free one's self
from any obsession.
Be it prejudice or hate...
or even love.
I had to, really.
I had no choice.
You're sounding just a little
like your father.
Did I ever tell you
how much I liked him?
I keep thinking about Carl.
How unfair it seems.
An accident.
Just like that.
Things just bear down on us,
I suppose.
A freighter in the fog.
Or a war.
Accident rules every corner
of the universe...
except maybe the chambers
of the human heart.
Morning, Horace.
Reminds you of 1930, doesn't it?
1929, Nels. I believe
you're thinking of 1929.
Of course it was, Horace.
Winter of'29.
All rise. The Superior Court
for the State of Washington...
County of San Piedro,
is now in session.
Members of the jury, this court
thanks you for your diligence...
in the task you have performed
under difficult circumstances.
However, in the light of the new
forensic evidence we have heard...
you are hereby discharged
from your responsibilities.
Order.
Order.
You will resume your seats.
Settle down.
Let us not forget...
we have been considering
the death of one man...
as well as pondering
the fate of another.
Will the defendant please rise?
Kazuo Miyamoto,
in the interest of justice...
the charges against you
are dismissed.
You're free to go home.
It's been a pleasure
serving with you.
Can I hold you now?
I'm so grateful
for your gentle heart.
