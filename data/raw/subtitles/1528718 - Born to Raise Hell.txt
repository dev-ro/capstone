The evil exists in every man,
while some rest to contain it,
I find it easier to embrace it.
Out of the way.
Keep your eyes open.
Stay alert.
Where's your friend Costel?
Where's your fucking warrant?
This is my warrant, bitch.
You're coming with me.
Sorry, you can't read.
Drop your weapons!
After 9/11 the United States
realized that narcotics were...
responsible for financing the majority
of the terrorist cells.
That's why they created
the international drug task force.
These task forces were fully funded
and overseen by the U.S. government.
They took their top narcotics officers...
and created interdiction teams
throughout Eastern Europe and Asia.
Six months ago, my partner was killed.
Now headquarters has sent
me a replacement.
I will find the men responsible,
and bring them to justice.
What a shock.
Sorry about not picking up earlier
I just, uh...
I mean, I've been trying
to call you ever since.
Really?
I don't have a missed call, Bobby.
Yeah, I've been trying to call you
but I mean I got tied up this warrant.
As usual the dope
comes before me, right?
It's nothing like that, I've just been
tied up and I'll be home soon.
All right?
Believe that shit.
Thanks.
Steve, right?
Name's Ronnie.
I'm the lead Romanian officer
on Bobby's task force.
He handpicked me one year ago.
Where is Bobby?
He just finished putting
together a drug warrant.
He asked me to take you straight
to the raid location.
You can leave your stuff here.
Hey!
Put his bags in the locker.
Yeah, Ill brief you on the way.
Let's go. Okay?
Let's move. This way.
- Thank you.
- It's okay.
- You want some juice?
- Yeah, sure. Thank you.
Have you seen this?
- Coffee?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
I've been watching you!
And I've booked a trip for you!
Turn around and bend over, bitch!
You set the radio locations,
you meant the South Building?
We have the North side.
- Let's go. Let's go get'em boys.
- Steve, right?
Take point guard.
- You got it?
- Got it.
Get down!
You got the stuff?
So let's get out of here.
We're safe.
Please, let me see some hands.
Hands. Let me see your hands!
Get down now.
That hurts!
Put it on.
We're clear in here.
Cuff him.
No one else live here?
- I want a lawyer.
- Just answer the question.
Sit down, sit down.
How's everyone look?
Check the cabinet.
- Why isn't she handcuffed?
- Chief.
We got product.
Okay, put that shit down, go out
to the car and get the task kid.
Hey, you got somebody
under the bed, man.
Come on, let me see your hands, man.
Let me see your hands.
- Slowly.
- I'm going out.
- Hands, hands, hands.
- Nice and slow.
Let me see your hands, bitch.
Turn around, turn around.
Turn around, turn around mother...
You get back!
- Listen to me. Are you listening?
- Yes.
I got this 45 turned right on your brain.
You got alot of guns here
on you right now.
Now put the fucking gun down
and everything will be okay.
Motherfucker, I'm speaking English.
It's simple, put the fucking gun down!
- Put the gun down.
- Okay.
Go cuff him.
Over here. Let me have some hands.
What the fuck is this?
You call this room safe?
You don't check the cupboard,
you don't look under the bed.
You wanna be a cop for a living?
You gotta be on the ball!
You're putting everybody's life at risk.
What the fuck is wrong with you, boy?!
You are late.
I had a... little problem
in my neighborhood, needed to adress it.
I thought you were interested...
in making money.
It's a little short.
Midgets are a little short.
- Money should never be.
- I get it.
Once I deliver it, you'll get your money.
Damn, look at this.
That'll work.
I'll expect to see you in a few days...
with the rest of my money.
Yeah, nice dealing with you too.
Motherfucker.
- Here comes the boss?
- You called this in yet?
Well, how is it gonna take
you to get courtesy about this?
You're right, bulletcase
exist from a 9mm Scorpion.
Booker's homicide just pulled up.
We'll shake this place down, see if anybody
saw something. Somebody's gotta talk.
Yeah, I think I know
the motherfucker who will.
She runs her mouth too much, keep it
shut during the flight to London, huh?
Hey!
Asshole.
Here, and just tell
the gentleman your name.
Bruce Sorin. Bruce.
Now Bruce, uh...
I wanna ask you a kind of a personal
question, 'cause you seem like a smart guy.
You right now are going away
for a long time,
but if you got something really good
for me I'll let you work it off...
or just kinda go up
the roof for a long time.
I like your style.
You've got a way of...
- cutting through the bush.
- Do you think?
I've been to American,
I know your type.
- Really?
- Yeah, I spent a lotta time there, in jail.
Seen plenty of you. Your street-wise.
Always got the angles covered.
Not an offense, I'm just trying
to develop a little understanding.
Maybe help you out, help myself.
Buddy, have got us something
good or not?
No, it's good, it's good. Booker's Cap.
been trying to catch this guy forever.
I'll tell you what.
We're gonna go into my office...
and you can whisper something
good to me. okay?
Christian, I'm taking this guy down
to my desk, I'll be with you in a minute.
Okay, just let me know,
where you want him locked up, right?
He's acting out on his exciety.
Listen to me, boy.
Why are you hitting...?
You're not suppose to hit somebody
while I'm holding them, man.
Take this guy down...
Put him in the piss-tank, man.
That one's got a lot of
sexual repression. Is he French?
What do you have?
A gun happy Romanian guy named Costel.
Him and his boys like
to do home invasions.
Costel has recent end issues with
the young and wealthy.
When he sees something
that catches his eye,
he follows it home, gets off
on killing and raping them.
Guy is fucking sick.
But this isn't all.
Guy runs a crew that uses females
to mule dope to London.
But when Costel's contact was discovered,
to be one of your own, he gunned him down.
- Steve?
- Yeah?
Do me a favor.
Take the cuffs off this guy
and get him some coffee for me.
I really need some coffee.
Ronnie, you get the coffee,
I'll get the cuffs.
No problem.
I hope he chokes on it.
How can we get to this guy?
The Russian, a really bad ass.
People say he is trained by the Spetsnaz.
Russian special forces?
He deals dope and guns, lots of it.
Supplies all the powder in this area,
trust me on this.
You know, trust is not one
of my more spectacular attributes.
If you set up on this Dimitri,
the Russian guy.
You'll run over Costel.
Hey, you wanna grab me
one of those too?
What's the problem?
Is that you're glued to your ass?
Get going yourself, man.
I'm working.
You know, there's now good news
and bad news.
The good news is, I'm gonna make you
take me to that address.
The bad news is you're not
gonna get to drink the coffee.
- Let's go.
- But Dimitri knows I got pinched.
That's why I'm getting you a bonus later.
Bring him over here to me.
Come on, let's go.
Here you go.
- Are you sure it looks okay?
- Yeah, I'm sure it's real.
This guy ain't someone
to fuck around with.
Do you think I'm someone
to fuck around with?
No, I'm just trying to cover my ass, man.
And you'd better leave me to Costel.
Get the gear in the van and let's go.
- Okay, I'm nervous, you know.
- Yeah, you should be.
I ain't got his kind of luck.
Nervous is good, it keeps on your toes.
You're the psychic.
Psychics never make it.
You watch too many American movies.
Don't worry, we'll be watching
you at the park.
What?
I need to re-up.
Heard you got arrested
by the Americans yesterday?
I got bailed out. Cops are fools.
Bring me a copy of the processing slip,
then we'll talk.
You asked for me,
what more do you need?
I don't need anything,
you are the one who need something.
Look, I'm just trying to do business,
trying to stay in the game.
- How much?
- A thousand.
You doubled your business over night.
Kinda like that. It's about making
up for my losses, you know.
Work hard, sleep less.
Price has gone up.
I'm cool with that.
Have no other choice.
You are a trusting man.
Yeah, I need therapy for that.
We'll have to continue
this conversation another time.
Come and see me in two days.
We'll do our business there.
Man, I need the shit now.
I said, two days.
Yeah, sure.
Sorry.
Friend is walking away,
look like it went smooth.
Your lucky like that.
Exactly. That's why I brought you on this
assignment, 'cause you're so fucking lucky.
I got four players eyeballing
us on this side.
Shit, looks like they
are coming this way.
- Yeah, we're burned.
- Stay still.
Where did she go?
Well, I lost her. Where is she?
Don't move.
We're burned, baby.
We're burned.
Come out, come out wherever you are.
We know you're in there.
Motherfuckers, man.
Listen guys, I think you know
what we're doing
and you don't get the fuck out of here
I'm taking you all to jail.
Fuck you, American cop.
Get over and let me see that hand!
Give it to me, faster.
- You got extra cuffs, go cuffs those guys.
- Nice work.
Ronnie we've been burned.
Copy that.
- What do you think?
- Let's do it.
Step out of the vehicle.
Can I see your license and registration?
For what?
You're part of an ongoing investigation...
- You're an American?
- Yeah.
Why is my license and registration
any of our concern?
Well, as I was about to say
before I was so rudely interrupted,
your person of interest in
an ongoing investigation with IDTF,
and we need to talk to you.
- Feel free.
- Thank you so much.
Mind if I look in the car?
- No problem.
- Good. Come on, back here.
Take care, it's Armani.
He's safe.
Is this yours?
Never seen it.
So I guess that would mean
that you don't have a license for it.
I told you, never seen it.
Okay, cuff him,
put him in the back, please.
Watch your head.
Take a look at the serial number on that.
You're not from this country.
Then why do work at enslaving others?
You should be chasing terrorists
in Afghanistan, not me.
I've already done that,
now I'm over here having fun.
Same as the one's that
we found at the surveillance.
That's what I thought.
You want us you call locals
and told the car?
- You should be careful who you were asked.
- I'll be careful.
- Argh, man.
- Shit.
This asshole's gonna bleed
all over your sheets now.
I know I'll be filing the complaint...
with your American superiors
about you doing this to me.
Go for it.
You Americans are known for your brutality.
Yeah, well you know, we're proud of it too.
- You wanna get rid of your gun charge?
- How?
You know, there's this piece of shit
named Costel, that you're deaing with,
- he's into some handed shit.
- Like what?
Oh, like, obscale home invasions
and murdering people for fun,
raping women before and after
they are dead.
He's a nice guy, charming.
Perfect guy for you to be
associated with.
I'm a family man.
And my wife and kid are sacred to me.
Sounds like you should chasing this gypsy
piece of shit instead of me.
You have a problem with this guy
you handle it on your own.
I plan on it.
I talked to the old man...
about Costel, you know.
He got really cold really quick.
Well, maybe a night in jail
will soften him up and he'll talk.
I'm feeling this Siberia
is a lot worse than here.
That's right, man.
Back there in the America
you watch TV.
In Russia that motherfucker watches you.
Oh, yeah?
You're talking from experience now?
The guy is smooth man, he bangs
himself up and try to blame us.
I mean it,
it's our word against his but...
He's working a lawsuit.
It's oldest trick in the book, so what?
Now man, he didn't won the lawsuit.
He's just trying to make us back-off.
So what do we do?
Drop the tag on the Russian?
We ought to push Dimitri, man, he's
the guy that's gonna lead us to Costel.
- Now look, something I wanna tell you.
- What's that, boy?
How much I admire me,
how much you wanna be like me?
Yeah, yeah, that too.
No, more importantly.
I'm about a month away
from being a father.
Really?
- Didn't know you have it in you.
- You joking?
Relax, it's not like I'm the first agent
to be on assignment...
when his wife is ready to drop.
I'll guess we're just gonna have to
take extra special care of you.
Sorry I'm late, you know how it is.
It's okay, you know I love you.
Bobby baby, what's going on?
Everything cool. How did
the thing with your sister work out?
- You're the man, she's got the job.
- Cool.
You want a drink?
You want something to drink?
She'll have the usual.
- Okay, cool.
- Thank you, baby. Thank you.
Look at that.
You still remember me?
Yeah, I remember you. It's kind of
amazing how a piece of shit like you...
can get on the street so fast.
Come here.
Do you see why I ain't eating out?
You can stay the fuck out.
Don't forget who's house it is, bitch?
Don't you forget
who pays the rent, you faggot.
Asshole.
Subconsciously, I meant to miss.
- I'll call you later.
- Don't bother.
Fuck!
Who told you how to drive, huh?!
Look what you've done to my bike.
Come fuck! Come, come, come.
Get out of your fucking trash car!
It's done.
It's the nature of this business
to have a few fuck-ups,
but we've had more than our share.
It's not going to happen again.
It shouldn't have happened
in the first place!
It's this fucking country.
They are not look like us.
They're feeding poison information
cause some... they're pressured.
No more fuck-ups.
Well, she didn't screw the job up,
did she?
Thank you for your help.
I see Mr. Personality hasn't changed any.
- Well?
- Smart. Just like we planned.
That's what I like to hear.
Let's go!
Come over here.
I'm ready to go.
I told you, there was nothing
to worry about.
You know, hate to admit it,
but good work.
Steve, we gotta get surrender
for the sum, one of those girls...
that's muling the drugs
to London. So let's...
Mayor Nejzi you're on your guard.
What's up?
Dead people, Bobby.
Dead people are my life.
Who the fuck died now?
The informant of yours,
according to the records.
Sorin was his name. Euro-biker type.
You signed him three days ago.
- When he died?
- About nine this morning.
Looked like a professional job.
Double tap on the head. No witnesses.
Any idea of a suspect?
Yeah, I do. The only problem is
he's using custody on the hearing.
- Alibies, don't get any better than that.
- No, they don't.
That's the last of it, right?
No, Adrian didn't make his
goddamn drop this morning.
That son of a bitch is late again.
We mistake your kindness
for weakness.
Now you're going to start preaching?
Adrian forgets how he's dealing with.
Tomorrow we pick up the cash
and take him out.
Then we take care of Dimitri.
Come on baby, let's go.
Let me do that for you.
Listen, you know, when we hooked up
you had said to me, if you remember
that you understood
when I told you I'm a cop,
and that, you know cops have to do
a lotta work out of the house...
and they're gone a lot and... you know, it's
a difficult deal for relationships sometimes
but you seem to be okay with it.
I understand your passion
for the job, sweetheart.
I just wish you wouldn't put it before me.
Ain't nobody putting nothing before you.
I know it's hard, but as soon
as I finish this case...
Don't say something
we both know isn't true.
You know I love you.
You were right, don't worry
about nothing.
You ain't got nothing to worry about,
I didn't mean to make
a scene last night, I apologize.
That's why I love you.
- Well, I have something for you.
- You have something for me?
Okay guys, listen up.
The target is located by the university.
Just of Carol I Boulevard.
On Strada Tudor Arghezi, right here.
And today's paper
was worked out by the locals
and their intel indicates that
this place may be a stash pad,
probably related to our main target,
Costel, who we've been trying
to track down.
One thing we do know is that one of his
runners, Adrian, will be there today.
These are the most recent photos
we have of some of his known accomplices.
There's more on the table
for you guys to look at.
But we don't have one of Adrian yet.
And the one thing
I want you all to remember,
this is a "Street" level case.
Which means even though
we have surveillance...
depending on the time of day
this place could be anything from a
Stashpad to, well a, daycare center.
Anything I missed, boss?
I want you guys, all the uniforms,
on the back,
in the rare event that we would meet any
kind of resistances that we can't handle.
The abort codeword is "Echo".
Any questions?
What kind of weapons
are we gonna run into?
He's known to have a 9mm Scorpion
and in the house there are
apparently several assault rifles.
Everybody good?
You guys stay on the back,
in case we chase somebody to you,
all right?
- Let's go get them.
- All right, let's go guys.
Ronnie! Quit playing with that thing
and pack it up.
- We got plenty of ammunition?
- Yeah.
I got 6 clips for each guy.
- Nice bangs. Everything?
- Yeah, we got lots.
Listen, I'm gonna make
you rear-guard today,
you got the shotgun rear-guard. It's good,
and I'm gonna put you on the top.
It's better. You got the new baby
and everything.
You serious?
Do I look like a fucking comedian, boy?
Police!
Come on. Come on, pick up the phone.
What the hell does he want?
Come on, man,
get the fucking phone!
Yeah?
Hey, hey, Costel,
boys are all over.
They got me pinned down, man!
Back up, back up.
They're shooting through the wall.
Fuck. Stash pad, now!
Stay down, down.
Geesh, Costel!
Are you still there?
Drop the gun.
Don't move, don't fucking breathe,
drop the gun.
Please.
- Come here.
- All right.
- Come here.
- All right.
Turn around.
Get the fuck down.
All right, come here.
Cuff him and search him.
Shit.
(MUMBLING)
They got Adrian.
Turn us around. We're going back.
Good job.
Where's Costel?
- Find him yourself.
- I'm gonna do that.
You got hit?
Yeah, vest stopped it.
Thank God.
Dimitri is here.
Can I get something else for you, sir?
No, it's fine. Thank you.
Mr. Costel will be here in a moment.
Look at this animal.
You think the cop was right about here?
Not my business.
At least not until I get my money.
Have a seat.
I feel like our relationship is fading, man.
We used to do business at your apartment
then at the park
and now, you make me the host.
Where is my money?
Well, there's a little problem.
One of my spots was hit today at a raid.
And this is my problem? Why?
It was your agent friend.
He probably picked up my scent
because I deal with you, huh?
I lost a lot of money, so beause of you,
I'm short 50 thousand.
If I don't get all of my money by tomorrow
you are a dead man.
You want to threaten me in my own place?!
The IDTF agent...
specifically asked about you,
and it wasn't just about selling dope.
Don't you see
what they are doing?
They're trying to turn us
against each other.
The shit he told me,
makes me sick to my stomach.
And if I find out it's true,
I'll come back and kill you myself.
Later.
Later.
All locals came up short on the good search
for the Range Rover, that opened up on you.
Well, like I told man,
I put about three rounds,
in the eyesight
but I got the shot of him.
You think it's this Costel character?
One million percent it's him.
Fuck, yeah it's him.
Hold it, stop, stop, stop.
Okay, back up.
This is the street.
Okay boys, get down.
Alright. Stash the body and grab the keys.
Just be cool and sit here wait till
we come back. Alright let's get this done.
Get back to the house now.
What the fuck! You think
you can hide from us?!
Where's the old man?!
Goddamn it.
No one told you to kill her yet!
She could have told us
where the money is.
Get outside and watch for him.
Both of you! I'll handle the kid!
No witnesses, not even kids!
Close the door behind you.
Get up. Get up.
- My family?
- Upstairs.
Stupid gypsy.
It's okay. It's okay, my boy.
I'm here.
Your father is here.
Take him next door.
You're too stubborn to die, huh?
- Where are you?
- Come pick us up,
two blocks west,
at the back of the building.
We'll be waiting at the corner.
Shit.
Are you really that fucking stupid?
Where is Costel and the other men?
I don't know.
Smells like fear, bitch.
Fuck! Bitch!
They are fucking dead!
Do you hear me? Dead!
Now, do you really want to die this way?
And for what?!
Go park up top, out of sight.
This is the address the Range Rover
is registered to.
Looks like somebody's already
been through here.
Drop the gun!
Argh, fuck!
8-25 headquarters.
8-25 headquarters, come in.
I got a code red, I got a officer down.
I'm at 'Aces and Eights', the North end
of the club, first floor.
I need EM fast, a-sap.
Direct pressure in there, man.
Okay. That son of a bitch.
Hang to, Ronnie. I'll be right back.
I'll be right back, you hear?
Come on!
Hey! Pull up to the front, right now.
Damn it, man.
Hey, boss.
I just heard what happened.
I'm really sorry.
Just so you know, headquarters
sent you out a senior investigator,
he'll have questions about what
you two were doing at the club.
My superiors are looking
for the same answers.
I just wish we could have
been there for backup.
So do I.
You have a major crimes task force
dedicated to justice.
You got all these guys running around...
you haven't grabbed one of them, have you?
These guys are not skilled commandos.
You know, I don't get it.
I'm here to see Robert Samuels.
Just wait here.
This guy is not a magician,
he's not a commando,
he's not a trained soldier,
he's not Jesus,
he's just a fucking gypsy.
That's what these two guys are here.
Chief, Dimitri is here to see you.
You guys better get your shit together or
I'm gonna get somebody else. You understand?
- Send him in.
- Guys, take a break.
What's going on?
I need to talk to you.
Sit down.
About what?
- Costel.
- What about him?
He's responsible for killing my wife.
And from what I hear, your partner.
I think we both want revenge,
that right?
- I'm listening.
- I want a fair trade, you get Costel
and I'm allowed to take revenge
on his man, Dada, for my wife's death.
Are you serious?
Won't take long before I get word
which place they're at.
When I do,
I will tell you everything.
Where he's hiding out.
Where he keeps the rest
of his cash and drugs.
All I ask, is you turn the blind eye...
to what I do to this Dada.
This isn't really the place
to have this conversation.
But I understand very well,
even better than you think
what the future may bring.
Do me a favor.
Call me soon, with good news.
And let's see what happens.
I'll call you on your cell
in the next 24 hours...
with the time and the location.
Tell me who found this motherfucker.
We found one of his workers appartments.
They're both well known to be there.
I want you to stand down on this.
It's just me and the agent, understand?
And after this is over...
I want to take my son back home.
This country
has taken too much from me.
I have a place.
You come alone tonight.
Understand?
You alone?
I have people close-by
but they will not interfere
with what we do.
Let me tell you something.
You're a gangster,
so technically, we really can't be...
seen together, hanging around together,
or even doing anything.
Understand what I'm saying?
- Keep your word?
- I will.
My people tell me they're inside
this apartment complex.
- How many?
- Four.
If I'm not out of there in about
10-15 minutes
camombay will be all yours.
Just remember our deal.
What are you doing here?
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
Freeze!
Hey, remember our deal.
I'm not trying to kill them,
just trying to slow him down.
He's in there.
Shit!
Correction flight
is north on Datcha Street.
Get up there
and set up a containment.
I hear you breathing.
It wasn't me, I didn't killed her,
it was Costel.
Where is Costel?
Ah, shit!
Ah, shit!
Roma Ace Bar,
Roma Ace Bar, down on the East Side,
he's there right now waiting
for me to pick him up.
My son told me who shot his mother.
And the one he described...
was you.
My guys are close behind coming fast.
You better get out of here quick.
Just leave.
Roma Ace, the main you want
is at the Roma Ace.
Out of the way.
Keep your eyes open. Stay alert.
Where's your friend Costel?
Where's your fucking warrant?
This is my warrant, bitch.
You're coming with me.
Sorry, you can't read.
Drop your weapons!
Shit!
Let's see what you got, boy.
Fuck you!
Is that all you got, bitch?
- You win, you win.
- All right, now turn around.
As the team commander,
the worst thing that can happen
is to lose men.
I lost two men,
my partner and now
his replacement Steve.
It cost them their lives coming here,
I hope it's all worth it.
Only a brilliant strategist
could beat me in one move.
Those could only be the hands
of one person.
Men of honor
always keep their word.
That was the deal.
You know, I was thinking...
men like us there's certain things
we find difficult to say, and certain
things we find difficult to hear,
but I have to say finally
how sorry I am for your loss.
I thought it would be really nice
if you could maybe take your
young man back to your country,
and then spend time with family.
And then it would be good for you to...
Funny you should say that.
It's exactly what I was thinking.
- Great minds think alike.
- What's that?
Tickets.
- Tickets?
- Yes.
You know that I know
you are a man of great needs,
and this was a small gesture of respect.
You know, you don't belong
here either, my friend.
And my work is finished,
now I can go,
find a nice warm spot somewhere.
Take a little break.
- You would have made a good Spetsnaz.
- Thank you very much. Goodbye.
