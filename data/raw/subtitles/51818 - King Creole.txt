Next Week, baby.
Songbird! Come here tonight
and l'll dance With you free.
No, you don't. You gotta pay me.
Danny, come on.
Your breakfast. Come on.
Don't let Pop catch you
talking to that.
Just being neighbourly.
He picked the neighbourhood.
Lay off. He Went broke.
The neighbourhood picked him.
Sit doWn and eat your breakfast.
lt don't feel like the last day
of school. Everything's so quiet.
Were you expecting a 21-gun salute?
Why not? At 3:00, it's all over.
Don't that make it kind of special?
TomorroW they call my name
and give me a piece of paper.
lt's for sure, isn't it, Danny?
- This time?
- Sure, kid. l'm a cinch.
You said that last year.
Pop bought all this junk
for a graduation party,
and there Was no graduation.
Old Mrs Pearson is the one that
flunked me, but l shoWed her.
l shoWed the old man, too. He's been
Waiting a year to have this party.
NoW he can stop bugging me.
He doesn't mean to bug you,
he Wants to be proud of you.
Sure.
l've been thinking a lot about
the old house, Mimi, and about Mom.
l Wish she could be here for
the graduation. l really miss her.
l miss her, too.
He misses her the most.
lt's terrible to lean on someone so
hard, you don't knoW you're leaning.
Never finding out until
she isn't there any more.
lt's been like stumbling around
in the dark for him ever since.
When he sits there
and Watches you graduate,
he'll have eyes again
for the first time in three years.
Then l'd better hurry.
Got a Whole day's Work ahead of me
before Mrs Pearson.
HoW do you think
that's been eating at him?
You Working in a joint
like The Blue Shade.
One man in the family's
gotta have a job.
Who cares Where you sWeep up? lt
looks the same in the garbage truck.
- Danny, you got Pa all Wrong.
- Me and the World.
Look, Sis, Why are We fighting?
lt's the last day of school.
- Yeah.
- Bye.
- Morning, Chico.
- Hi, Danny.
- Who's that?
- Maxie's friends.
They've been here all night.
Try to Work around 'em. See you.
OK. See you tonight.
Don't be like that. Come on, Ronnie,
Maxie said to be nice.
l am being nice to you.
l haven't spit in your eye yet.
That's very funny.
You better do What Maxie says.
He's the boss around here.
Hey, kid!
What happened to the music?
- The band Went home.
- Can you play the piano?
Leave him alone. He's just a busboy.
This joint's got a cabaret licence.
l paid, l Want to be entertained.
Let's dance, honey.
That's enough entertainment.
- The band Went home.
- Busboy here Will sing us a song.
Hey, kid. Sing us a song
and l'll buy you a drink.
Mister, l've gotta sWeep up.
l appreciate it,
but l'll be late for school.
School? The kid goes to school.
Ain't that nice?
l Went to school once.
Bartender's school.
Ronnie, you ever go to school?
l said, you ever go to school?
Wake up, stupid, l'm talking to you.
No, they never had
to give you lessons.
Why, you...
- Let go of me, Will you?
- Forget it.
OK, OK, take it easy. l'll sing.
You hear that, Ralph?
The kid is gonna sing.
Don't ever try that again.
All right, What are you gonna sing?
Sing your school song.
You gotta have a school song.
An alma mater. The one With the Words
about loyal and true.
You heard the lady. Go ahead.
Come on, kid. Jazz it up!
- Attaboy, kid.
- That's real nice, kid, real nice.
Here. What do you do for an encore?
Never mind.
Come on, honey, let's finish
the dance. We don't need no music.
Hop it! What do you think l am?
l knoW What you are.
Come here and be quiet.
You knoW What? lt's a lifetime study
to find out Who you are!
To thine oWn self be true,
and it folloWs as the day...
To thine oWn self be true...
lf you can afford it.
lf you'll excuse me,
my mother is Waiting for me.
You never had a mother. Sit doWn!
You looking for trouble, too, kid?
No. l'm just looking
to get out of here.
- Let me go With you.
- Get out and mind your oWn business.
- Get up! You're not a baby.
- Leave her alone.
Come on. Get out of here.
Oh, boy.
You're a pretty fancy performer, kid.
NoW you knoW What l do
for an encore.
Go on, get out of here.
Taxi!
Come on, baby, have a drink.
l guess l'll lose
the job for this.
No, you Won't.
They Won't tell Maxie.
Maxie doesn't like to have
his merchandise manhandled.
He'll loan me out
to be mauled a little bit,
but When it comes
to a sock in the eye,
that pleasure is for
Maxie Fields alone.
- Nice fella.
- Maxie? Yeah.
He Wouldn't like you. You knoW Why?
Because l like you.
Maxie hates everything l like.
Maxie's my benefactor.
He's the circus master,
the cheese, the big cheese.
Big and green and mouldy.
You're drunk.
lt's 8:00 in the morning.
l had to be home by midnight,
l forget Whose,
or my convertible
turns into a pumpkin.
Maxie turns everything
into a pumpkin.
Danny, Why don't you kiss me?
All the Wrong people try to.
We're almost to the school.
Tell me Where you live.
l Want to go to school With you.
l used to love to go to school.
l Was gonna be everything.
A nurse, and...a bus driver.
- You knoW What l am?
- You're in the circus.
That's right. l'm in the circus.
l'm going in and explain everything.
You're going home,
Wherever that is.
Danny, Mrs Pearson marked you absent.
- We'll shoW Mrs Pearson.
- Where'd you pick that up?
Go on. You never seen anybody
With a feW too many?
- Tell him Where to take you.
- l'll be a good girl.
lf you'll give me a kiss,
l'll tell the man Where l live.
- HoW about that chick?
- Go on.
Danny, you're blushing.
One second, Danny.
Go ahead, Mrs Pearson.
Late on the last day of school,
your mouth smeared With lipstick.
- HoW do you explain that, Mr Fisher?
- l don't think l can, Mrs Pearson.
You see, sir,
this morning l Went in...
l usually go in to sWeep up, see?
- But... Well, look, honey...
- Mr Fisher!
l have been instructing
for 20 years,
- and no one ever called me ''honey''.
- l believe you.
Mrs Pearson, let me talk to the boy.
Forgive me, sir, l've talked to the
boy many times, and to What avail?
ln an unprovoked
display of violence,
he attacked tWo of his classmates.
The boy has no conception
of respect and discipline.
Under the circumstances, regretfully,
perhaps, l have no choice.
Mr Fisher Will not
be graduating tomorroW.
Danny, Wait a minute.
l'd like to talk to you.
You knoW l'll have to
go along With her?
- l Want you to knoW that l'm sorry.
- Thanks.
- l'll be seeing you next year.
- No, you Won't.
NoW, Wait a minute. Sit doWn, Danny.
Sit doWn, l said.
You've just been told
that you're not graduating.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
l'm not graduating. That's it.
NoW What do you Want?
l once had a son, Danny.
He lived 1 3 years.
Some hoodlums jumped him and he died.
What's that got to do With me?
Because you have
all the earmarks of being a hoodlum,
- or Whatever you Want to call it.
- This isn't principal talk.
The more difficult the student, the
more l try to lean over backWards.
Mr Evans, We moved into
this neighbourhood three years ago.
ln those three years l've shined
shoes and dusted in a barbershop.
l've done toWel duty
in four different men's rooms.
l've stacked chairs, sWept floors
in every joint on Bourbon Street.
lt's got so l look longer at a dame
With clothes on than one Without.
l'm not a hoodlum,
but l am a hustler.
l've had to be for
a very simple reason. My old man.
My mother Was killed
in an accident three years ago.
lt might as Well
have gotten the old man, too,
because he took himself right out
of the line-up. He quit cold.
He lost the drugstore he oWned,
he lost the house,
and then finally What feW
little jobs he's had since.
Maybe l could have liked school,
Mr Evans,
but every time l Wanted
to play ball, l had to Work.
Somebody had to.
AnyWay, noW l'm through. l'm through.
l Wasn't aWare you Worked
after school, Danny.
lt's not the Working after school,
it's the Working before.
lt's been nice talking to you.
l'm sorry l said What l did, Danny.
That's all right.
My life's a long Way from over yet,
and you never knoW,
you may be right.
That's him.
- Excuse me.
- You Danny Fisher?
- What about it?
- Let's take a Walk.
What's the beef?
They call me Shark.
This is Sal, and that's Dummy.
- l...
- All right.
You beat up my brother
in school today,
and l believe
in an eye for an eye.
You go for the knife,
l'll bash his brains out.
You go real fast. All right.
You're right about my brother.
He should learn a little manners.
So Would you like
to hang out With us?
Why not? Wait a minute.
Wait. We get money.
Sometimes We get a lot.
We got something
cooking for us tomorroW.
lf you change your mind,
We'll be right here.
l said no.
Thanks.
Good boy.
Fights real dirty.
Well?
What's the matter?
Old Lady Pearson flunked me.
l'm not graduating.
- Danny, no.
- Danny, yes.
For the second year in a roW, yes.
lf this keeps up much longer,
l'll be a freshman again.
But you could
go back another year.
Yeah? You don't
make money in school.
Pop's been fired four times
in the last year,
and he hasn't got a job noW.
You're Working, l'm Working,
and from noW on, full time, kid.
Well, guess Where l've been.
Got a quart of ice cream
and this to go With it.
- A little special dessert...
- Papa, l Want to talk to you.
Good, Son.
l Want to talk to you, too.
Mimi, you're gonna
have to listen from the kitchen.
Let's see noW, Son.
Where do l begin?
Pop, you gotta understand...
NoW, l don't gotta nothing.
You gotta, cos l'm older than you.
l go first.
Danny, l made some notes last year
When you Were supposed to graduate,
and l think l still have them.
Yeah, here they are.
Kind of silly, isn't it?
A father making notes
on things to say to his son.
- Pop...
- l can say it all in one breath.
l'm proud of you, Son,
because you Went back to school.
- Pa, there's something...
- l knoW all about it.
Mr Evans called me.
l spent all afternoon With him.
We had a nice long chat together.
- l'm sorry, Pop.
- l'm sorry, too, Son,
but things are gonna be different,
that's Why We're celebrating.
We also had a talk
With that Mrs Pearson Woman.
She said that you could
graduate before next year
if you'd go to night school
and learned a little discipline.
So that's hoW it's gonna be.
No more Working for you.
You'll do the going to school,
l'll do the going to Work.
HoW many times...?
You've got to graduate if you ever
Want to take up a profession.
- Pa, We've been through this.
- l Want you to.
l don't Want you Working on Bourbon
Street With bums all your life.
A profession
sets a man apart from the World.
Like you? A registered pharmacist
and you can't get a job.
You're Wrong about that, Danny.
An opening came up
at the Regal Pharmacy,
and they're sending me
to see the manager.
- You haven't got the job.
- They'll hire me.
- Sure.
- They Will and l'll keep the job.
- Things Will be different.
- l'm not going back to school.
Look, Son, you didn't fail
because your marks Were bad.
Mr Evans said you failed
because of your attitude.
Anybody that disagreed With you
got a punch.
- ls that What l brought you up for?
- No, Pa, it's not,
but l stopped listening to you.
l ran out of other cheeks.
Pop, When l Was just three feet
high you took me to the circus.
You accidentally bumped into a guy,
and he turned
and punched you in the mouth.
And you knoW What you did?
Nothing. Nothing!
When they sWing at you,
you gotta sWing back.
Maybe you can't,
but l'm not taking after you.
l'm going out and make a buck.
- Hi.
- Well, noW We're someWhere.
- l Was hoping you'd shoW.
- You said something about money.
That's What We Were talking about.
You knoW that five-and-dime
on Charles Street?
We Were gonna pull a phoney fight,
but my brother told me
that you sing like a bird,
and that's What you're famous for,
singing and flunking.
- What's singing got to do With it?
- What a cube.
l ain't never
stole nothing before.
You're not gonna steal anything noW.
All you're gonna do is sing.
Here's the plan. That
five-and-dime on Charles Street...
- Sings beautiful, don't he?
- He sure does.
- You sing nice.
- Thanks.
- You Were in on it, Weren't you?
- ln on What?
- Could l have a glass of Water?
- Certainly.
- What'll you have?
- l'll...
- Root beer?
- Yeah.
My, it's hot in here, isn't it?
lsn't it? Don't you think so?
lt's alWays hot this time of year.
My, that tastes good. Thank you.
- What's your name?
- Nellie.
- What time you get through Work?
- Why?
- l thought l might meet you.
- What do you think l am?
- l'd like to find out.
- Mr Mclntyre, Mr Mclntyre, hurry!
Look at the counter.
You gonna meet me after Work?
l'm through at 10, so if you're here,
l can't help but see you.
Thanks a lot, kid.
l don't knoW hoW it happened!
lt Wasn't my fault!
Mr Furst, l'm very careful
about the accounts.
The books shoW it clearly.
There can't be any mistake.
Excuse me. A customer.
- Anything l can do for you, sir?
- Yes, sir, l came about the job.
- That job has been filled.
- The employment office said...
- l hired a man yesterday.
- But l've got to have the job.
The agency sent me.
l have my diploma.
l'm a registered pharmacist
With 25 years behind me.
- What's the trouble?
- Just a mistake about a job.
- What's the mistake?
- l Want a younger man.
He looks younger than me. We've had
four younger men in three months.
Have you read his credentials?
ls he good or incompetent?
- HoW do you tell that?
- l'll Wait over here.
- Give him an application.
- l don't have any.
Then give him the job.
- You start Work tomorroW morning.
- Thank you.
Chico, you better
find somebody else.
- l can't Work nights any more.
- Up to you, Danny.
No complaints from this end.
The old man got a job today,
and We made kind of a deal.
He Works, and l go to school.
Not really. l got an old man,
give him a jug of Wine, he's happy.
- Danny.
- What's the matter, trouble?
No. We're gonna divvy up later.
That fence gave us over 90 bucks.

Don't you...

You lookin' for an early grave?
He's your boss.
Him you don't fool With.
Why not? l'm the king of Yugoslavia.
No. He's king of everything.
He oWns the air you're breathin'.
- Only in here.
- He can shut it off real quick.
Why does a busboy

A busboy! Where did you meet him?
You're hurting me.
What are you talking about?
You knoW the kid. Don't lie to me.

My old man
Wants me to go back to school.
Sit doWn.
What does he Want you to be?
He used to talk about me
becoming president,
but l think
he gave up on that idea.
HoW much does a singing job pay?
Here you start at scale,
85 a Week.
lf they like you, you get more.
HoW does it sound?
lt sounds good, but...
l never sang professionally
before. l don't knoW if l can.
- You did it last night.
- Last night l Was mad.
So stay mad.
You've sold me.
lf l could just sell my old man.
lf you do as he says and go
to school, What about after school?
No deal. He says l do the studying,
he does the Working.
Only, l saW him do the Work.
You hate to see someone craWl,
especially your oWn father.
l pushed him into that job,
but $85 a Week could get him out.
- Let me talk to him.
- l've knoWn him since l Was born.
- lnvite me to dinner.
- You're Wasting your time.
lt's a free meal. You afraid of him?
- No.

You knoW him all right.
KnoW him? Maxie and l go a
long Way back. We Were kids together.
l remember the first Words
that came out of his mouth...
- ''Stick 'em up.''
- See you at dinner.
No, you don't understand hoW l feel,
and you Won't Watch out for him
like he's your oWn son,
because he's not your son.
Mr Fisher, you keep speaking
of Danny having a profession.
Singing is a profession. All right,
so he's starting in the seWer.
SeWers run under the best cities,
some lead to the fanciest plumbing
at the Ritz.
But Danny isn't a plumber.
- What l meant...
- l knoW What you meant.
The ansWer is no.
l'm sorry, Mr LeGrand.
You're not sorry.
Why don't you ask him What he Wants?
The boy has an unusual talent.
Let him think for himself.
You have no right
to ask these questions.
Mimi, Will you
please get Mr LeGrand's hat?
All right, Pop.
Thanks for dinner, Mimi.
You're some cook.
Thanks.
l may be leaving empty-handed,
but everyWhere else l'm full.
l'm going out for a While, Pa.
l'd like to speak
to you again about this.
- Maybe have a drink, talk it over.
- l don't drink.
No, l didn't think you did.
Goodbye, Danny.
Why'd you bring a man like that here?
You didn't have to talk like that.
He thinks l can do a job for him.
But you don't care What he thinks
or What l think, for that matter.
- What do you Want?
- A pink convertible.
- Then register at school.
- Pa, l got a very average brain.
l'm not a brilliant student.
Do you understand?
- l don't Wanna craWl.
- ls that What l do?
You have no choice.
They got you on the run early.
No! That's not the truth!
l've fought...
You fought! Sure, you fought!
You back-pedalled all the Way.
l saW What happened today, Pa,
and it's not gonna happen to me.
LeGrand's got 85 bucks a Week
for me to be a performer.
- l'll take a chance.
- What about school?
- l Went.
- And failed.
l'm through failing.
lf you Were older
l'd ask you for a drink With me.
- l'm old enough to have a drink.
- SWell. Let's go.
Not tonight.
lt Would look kind of funny.
TomorroW night?
- l'll pick you up at nine.
- All right, it's a date.
You knoW, l Was Wondering,
is there anything in particular
a man of 40 says to a girl of 20?
- Say you're 38.
- Yeah.
- Sorry, Mr LeGrand.
- That's all right.
Mind if l have a drink
With your sister?
You knoW l don't care,
but check With the old man.
- He Won't make a singer out of me...
- No, he's gonna make one out of me.
- Do We sign papers or shake hands?
- We shake hands.
After you open and you're a smash,
We'll sign papers.
- l'll be at the club tomorroW.
- Good.
Rock and roll at the King Creole!
The hottest shoW in toWn!
Fabulous Forty Nina doing
the dance that started the Gold Rush!
And tonight,
the neW sensation of Bourbon Street,
Danny ''Boom Boom'' Fisher!
The old man Wouldn't come?
Some father.
- He's a good father.
- But a lousy audience.
Here We go. You'll be great tonight.
l heard you rehearsing.
- What songs you sing, folk songs?
- l guess so.
That's What l thought. What planet?
Just laughing it up. No offence.
- Nervous?
- A little.
l Wanted you to knoW
the place isn't full.
But half a house can hate you
as hard as a full house.
As far as you're concerned,
the place is jammed.
They're expecting the best.
l'm glad you told me. l'm not nervous
noW. l'm scared to death.
Just sing like you're mad,
you'll be a smash.
The biggest Words in shoWbiz,
''You're on.''
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've been Waiting for.
King Creole presents
a young man With a big future.
The sensation of Bourbon Street,
the boy With the beat, Danny Fisher!
- Eddie! Put his name up in lights.
- Right.
- Hey, Danny.
- Hi.
You busy? OK. We got a date.
- Where?
- l'll shoW you.
We're almost there. lt's just around
this bend. Wait till you see it.
You don't knoW hoW l Was hoping you'd
come by. l don't even understand it.
l mean, lots of fellas have come
into the store asking for a date.
Just like you. Making cracks.
You Were even Worse.
You came in to rob the store.
But l Was looking
for you When l came out.
Then you took me to that hotel,
and l Went With you.
l don't understand it.
l thought l Was a nice girl.
You are a nice girl, Nellie.
l've been thinking about that night,
and l'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too. l told you before...
No, Danny, that's not
What l'm sorry about.
lt's like everything
just started With you.
l guess both of us did something
that day We'd never done before.
l never robbed a store. There's
a last time for everything, too.
- l didn't mean it.
- Wait. See that house over there?
Way over there? See it?
That used to be our house.
Pa bought it When l Was eight.
Kind of a birthday present.
We had a lot of happy times there.
l'll buy that house back someday,
or one just like it.
And l guarantee you, nobody's gonna
take it aWay from me. Nobody.
l told my mother about you.
l told her l met
a million-dollar boyfriend
in a five-and-ten-cent store.
Danny, aren't you ever
going to kiss me tonight?
Nellie, don't fall
in love With me.
Love means getting married,
having kids.
l don't even knoW Who l am yet.
- Who do you have to be?
- l don't Wanna be like my old man.
Love, marriage, having kids.
l Wanna be somebody first.
Do you knoW a better Way?
You could still kiss me.
Just leave it at that, Nellie.
For noW, anyWay.
Just so it Was you l Wanted
to be With to shoW my house to.
Hurry up! Your breakfast
is getting cold.
OK, l'm coming.
Big shot. Sing a feW songs
and right aWay sleep all morning?
You're a little behind yourself.
Mr LeGrand kept me up
half the night talking about you.
- What happened the other half?
- Why, you!
Charlie's a very fine man.
l could like him a lot.
- You seen Pop this morning?
- For a minute.
Did he ask hoW it Went last night?
- l told him they all applauded.
- What did he say?
- You knoW Pop.
- What did he say?
He said Wash your hands
before you bring him his lunch.
Sounds like Pop.
Here.
l don't care hoW long you've been
Writing prescriptions.
Will you ever understand
that l'm running the store?
l understand, Mr Primont.
You understand, Mr Primont,
you understand, Mr Primont!
That's What you're paid for. You
can't teach an old dog neW tricks.
- l'm not an old dog.
- Don't ansWer me back!
Mop up this floor.
Go ahead and take it.
Mop over there.
Hey, Danny. You knoW you got
this Whole street buzzin'?
- Yeah?
- They say you're the next somebody.
l kneW you
When you Were singing for Watches.
lt's a little early
to reminisce, Shark.
Maxie Fields Wants to see you.
- l don't Wanna see him.
- l have to bring you.
Maxie's no guy to give the brush to.
He can get rough if he Wants to.
You knoW What l mean.
Let him make a reservation.
There's three shoWs a night.
That drugstore you just come out,
that's Where your old man Works.
So?
Nothin'. l just go in there
and get cigarettes once in a While.
lf my old man Was getting knocked
around like that, l'd help him.
- l been Working on it.
- l'll make you a deal.
You come see Maxie Fields,
l'll try to Work up an angle.
You never can tell. You do me
a favour, and l'll do you one.
Where's Fields?
l'll take you to him. l'm on
his payroll noW. l'm one of his boys.
And that drugstore situation,
it'll clear up just like that.
- This is it. Come on, Walk right in.
- Hiya, pal. Shark treating you OK?
Up them stairs.
Maxie's expecting you.
- Aren't you coming?
- l'll Wait here.
- This is Where you live?
- This is Where l visit.
What's all the chatter?
Send the kid in.
Hi, Danny. l hear you're a smash.
Good neWs travels fast.
- Sit doWn. Care for a drink?
- No, thanks.
- Was there anything special?
- No, nothing special.
Just a friendly get-together.
l'm interested in any neW attraction.
lt's good for all of us.
Then again, you never knoW.
What's friendly one day
is business the next.
You got good taste, Danny.
But you got to be able to afford it.
Ronnie Wants money
even to serve a drink.
- Maxie, please.
- Serve the kid a drink.
l don't Want a drink.
Ronnie Won a contest once.
Best legs in the state of...
- Where's that you're from, honey?
- Maine.
That's it. Maine.
ShoW the kid your legs.
Maxie, please.
You Won a contest With them legs.
Must have been 2,000 people Watching.
Don't be embarrassed.
ShoW the kid What Won.
All right, Maxie.
Pretty good, huh? There's nothing
Wrong With the rest of it.
l gotta get going.
l just Wanted this little chat,
get to knoW you.
l like to see people get ahead.
And like l said, Who knoWs?
Maybe someday We'll do business.
- You may be Working for me again.
- l don't think so, Mr Fields.
You never can tell.
After all, l saW you first.
l admit, l Was put out When you quit
to go With a crumb like LeGrand.
Charlie's no crumb.
He's a decent fella.
Oh, l forgot.
l forgot about him and your sister.
This has been
quite a Week for Charlie.
First, he finds a singer,
then he finds a girl.
- You're some talented family.
- What are you trying to say?
l got only one thing to say, kid.
l don't like losing things.
l don't mind taking, but l don't
like to lose. Not even a busboy.
When l lose something, l Want it
back, and l get it. That's all.
You got a long Way to go, boy.
Lots and lots of good luck.
ShoW him to the door, honey.
Don't come back here
any more, Danny. Stay far, far aWay.
Thanks. l could give you
the same advice.
As Maine goes, so goes Maxie Fields.
Maxie buzzed me.
l Was doWnstairs, and he buzzed me.
- Shark!
- Yes, Mr Fields?
Come here, Shark. l Wanna talk
to you. Get some ice, Ronnie.
Yes, Mr Fields.
What can l do for you?
Come on. Move it.
What have you got on this Fisher kid?
Nothing much. He helped us do a
little job on the five-and-ten once.
Not big enough.
l Wanna tWist real hard. Work on it.
That's funny, Mr Fields.
l just got an idea.
lt's his old man.
He Works in a drugstore...
Just in time, ladies.
Hope you made reservations.
- Wasn't Danny Wonderful tonight?
- Yes, Wonderful.
He gets better all the time.
- Hi, Danny.
- Nina?
lf my girl Nellie comes by tell her
l got something to take care of.
You're the boy Who can do it.
Boy, that kid is
sure bringing in the business.
He's ruining my performance,
there's nothing but Women out there.
They don't Want to see me.
Tonight one yelled, ''Leave it on!''
- Maybe l should do the strip.
- Why don't you?
Eddie? l'll be a little late
for the next shoW.
There's old man Primont
With the dough for the bank.
l hope he doesn't leave
before Danny gets here.
lt's almost 1 1 .
Just don't leave, mister,
till Danny gets here.
- You sure he's gonna be here?
- He'll be here.
l gotta hand it to you, Shark.
You sure are a good salesman.
Here comes the pigeon.
- l tried to get you on the phone.
- What for?
- Call it off. You don't oWe me.
- You Were hot for this before.
- l've been thinking...
- lt Works both Ways.
We get the money, you get
this drugstore situation sorted.
- The old man Wouldn't...
- He Would if he could.
Look. Primont's
getting ready to leave.
You go on home. You knoW Where
the bank is, drop this off.
- l'll finish up the inventory.
- l hope it stops raining.
- Take my hat and coat.
- l didn't mean it that Way.
- No, go ahead and take it.
- Thank you.
All right, have it your Way,
but don't you say
you never had the chance.
All right, there he is.
There's Primont.
Are you With us or not?
lt's for your old man, you knoW.
- That's Danny's father!
- We take him anyWay.
- Sharky, it's his old man!
- HoW do We knoW? We just play dumb.
Do you knoW Where Front Street is?
No, young man, l don't.
l don't knoW Where Front Street is.
Can't figure this kid.
He's been in there for half an hour.
He looked sick When he came back.
- l've got to see Danny.
- So does that audience.
- He's in there, Nellie.
- Danny?
lt's your father.
Mimi phoned from the hospital.
Some thugs beat him up.
She Wants me to bring you there.
Oh, no.
He Was going to the bank
and they jumped him.
He's in bad shape, Danny.
Mimi and Charlie
are at the hospital noW.
- ls he all right, Doc?
- He's alive. Just.
There's been damage to the brain.
We've relieved the pressure
but he'll need another operation
immediately, a delicate one.
Dr Martin Cabot has performed
this kind of operation.
- ls he good?
- He's the best, but expensive.
- HoW expensive?
- A couple of thousand, maybe more.
l'm still deep in hock,
but maybe l can scrape up 500.
We'll get it some Way.
Dr Patrick. Where's this man?
Where's this Fisher?
Dr Cabot!
lt took me a year to Wangle
this dinner invitation. Lucy Pitman.
Anything for Maxie Fields. Thank you.
- You the boy?
- Yes, sir.
Mr Fields must be very fond of you.
Says you used to Work for him.
He Wanted to help out.
Let's go.
When you Work for Maxie Fields,
it's better than Blue Cross.
What's the case?
They've been in there for hours.
Must be some kind of World's record.
- He made it.
- Thank God.
l'm going home, no sense
in going to that dinner party.
- Lucy gives me a pain anyWay.
- Thank you, Doctor.
He'll be all right.
May take a little While.
But he's a strong man.
A real fighter.
But, Doc, about Maxie Fields. HoW...
Strange man, isn't he?
Very coarse, vulgar, very poWerful.
Send him my best.
l'll send him my bill.
Thank you, Doctor.
l'll pay him back, Sis.
l'll pay every cent.
l got a lot of payin' back to do.
A lot of payin' back.
There'll be plenty
of tables for everyone!
Just stay in line
and don't go aWay.
This kid is absolutely sensational!
Just be patient, folks.
lt Won't be very long noW.
- Good evening, folks.
- Hi!
- HoW's your father?
- Much better.
Let her through, folks.
Her brother pays the bills.
Sorry l'm late.
Just a final check on Pop.
- Everything OK?
- He's coming home tomorroW.
lt's been a long four Weeks.
- What do you Want?
- Mr Fields Would like to see you.
- What about?
- Just Wants to see you.
- l don't Want to see him.
- You don't understand the job l got.
When Maxie says bring somebody,
l gotta bring 'em.
So l'll make it short and sWeet.
He Wants to see you.
Here's the key to his apartment.
Just go upstairs and turn the lock.
You understand?
For a little guy,
you make a lot of noise.
l'm remembering a rainy night
and a man carrying a bag of money.
Your old man's been in hospital
about a month, ain't that right?
He gets out tomorroW.
l'm real glad about that.
Just take this here key.
You knoW Where it is.
l should have finished
you off a long time ago.
Come on.
You're Working for Maxie, too?
- We're all Working for Maxie noW.
- That figures.
- Go right on up.
- Thanks, pal.
Come on in.
l've been Waiting for you.
- lt's a nice night for an accident.
- Yeah.
Where's Fields?
l'm supposed to see him.
You Want to see him?
Come With me.
There he is. Out and gone.
lsn't he sWeet?
Every time l see him lying doWn,
l keep looking at his chest, hoping.
But the pig
keeps right on breathing.
- l guess he can't see me tonight.
- Danny, Wait.
He didn't Want to see you tonight.
He Wanted me to see you.
- What about?
- He Wants you to go to Work for him.
- What are you supposed to do?
- Whatever l can do about it.
- Your heart Wouldn't be in it.
- You Wouldn't miss it.
Would you like a drink?
Would you like a cigarette?
Shall We talk? Can l do anything
for you? Anything at all?
The general idea is
l'm supposed to befriend you.
- You knoW, for a...
- For a bum? A tramp? For What?
l Was just gonna say you got
a pretty good Way of talking.
A lot of tramps
graduate school With honours.
- As a matter of fact, me.
- l flunked Without honours.
l'm sorry, but l don't think
l can handle this set-up.
- This is a set-up, isn't it?
- lt Was all fixed in advance.
You tell Maxie Fields
that l Wasn't in the mood.
l'll be square With him in a feW
months, that's hoW l Wanna keep it.
- Danny, l Wish you Wouldn't go.
- This isn't the accident, honey.
That happened that
first morning in The Blue Shade.
From then on, everything's been
fixed like a crooked fight.
And you're Wrong about the heart.
l do miss it.
l miss it so much l may marry a girl
because she has one to give.
- l'm not asking you to marry me.
- You're asking me something.
- You're a little tight, aren't you?
- l'm not tight. l'm drunk.
But l'll tell you What you are.
You're being rude, condemning me,
and ignoring my God-given charms.
God didn't give you the charms
for What you're using them for.
That's funny. And l read
the instructions so carefully.
Please don't go. Come here.
l Want to shoW you something.
Look.
What's he doing doWn there?
He has orders from the pig
to clock your entrance and exit.
You're supposed
to spend a feW hours here,
and in those feW hours,
acquire the habit of coming back.
ln due time, Mr Fields Will approach
you With a bill for my graciousness.
- Double-cross Charlie LeGrand.
- Exactly.
What if l leave noW?
Then the pig Will punish me
for having failed.
lf you Were kind,
you'd stay for a feW hours
and just pretend like you like me.
We could smoke some cigarettes,
play some music.
Just make it seem
as though l have charm.
l could sing some songs for you.
l used to be a singer, you knoW.
Yes, l did.
- You remember that one?
- Yeah. That's a real oldie.
Used to be my theme song.
l ask you to stay because
l hate to be punished by Mr Fields.
He's not a very sensitive man.
All right. l'll stay.
And l think you are charming.
- l don't use that Word, but you are.
- Thank you.
- Ronnie.
- l'm sorry.
Don't cry.
You'll Wake up the circus master.
- Danny, hold me. Hold me, please.
- What are you doing With this man?
- HoW'd you get into this?
- HoW do you get out?
- Go home, Danny. Go home.
- Ronnie...
No, no. Not in this house.
l Wouldn't knoW if it Was because
l Wanted you or Maxie did.
- Maxie has nothing to do With it.
- l Wouldn't be too sure.
Sorry to intrude. l don't mind
you tWo Wrestling around,
but as everyone knoWs,
Wrestling is all a fake.
Let's not forget
Who's supposed to Win: me.
- l told you, l Won't Work for you.
- lt's too bad.
l Was hoping it could be arranged
on some kind of a friendly basis.
But it can be done
the other Way, too.
You listen to me, punk.
You're gonna Work at my club.
l can do a lot for you,
and l can do a lot against you.
Your old man's coming
out of the hospital tomorroW.
Might not be good for his health
if he kneW you put him there.
- lt Was an accident.
- Was it?
Somebody Was gonna get hit.
Too bad it Was him.
lt Was all done because of you.
You don't think he'd mind?
You tell him. Or shall l?
- You do it, and l'll kill you.
- l got an easier Way.
Just sign this piece of paper.
There's nothing on it,
l'll fill it in later.
- No, Danny. No!
- Shut up.
Or maybe l'll fill Charlie's place
With stink bombs every night.
lf that's an unpleasant thought,
hoW about real bombs?
You think l Wouldn't?
Easiest thing in the World.
Make it look like an accident.
Anything can be made to look like
an accident. What do you say, kid?
That's more like it. Don't let me
interrupt you any longer.
You Were just saying to her...
''Maxie has nothing to do With it.''
So noW you knoW.
That's hoW you get into it.
NoW Maxie's got you like he's got me.
lt's too late.
You do something Wrong, and that
makes you do something Worse.
And then you don't knoW
the difference any more.
Danny, l'm so sorry.
Ladies and gentlemen,
l Would just like to say
thanks for everything.
You people have been Wonderful,
and l'll never forget you.
l Want you to knoW that l'll alWays
be grateful. Thank you very much.
- Excuse me.
- What's the matter?
- Kid, that Was a great shoW.
- Thanks, Charlie.
What Was the curtain speech
all about?
We never got around to signing
those papers you talked about.
So What's the hurry?
There's no hurry. l just don't knoW
hoW to tear up a handshake.
What do you mean?
l'm quitting you, Charlie. l got
a better offer from Maxie Fields.
You're no good, Danny. You belong
on the street With the hoodlums.
l thought you'd changed,
but you belong With them.
You threW it all aWay.
You, me, everything.
Danny, is anything Wrong?
Are you all right?
Sure.
You sounded funny When you called.
l got here as soon as l could.
l told Mr Mclntyre it Was
an emergency, l'd be right back.
Nellie, there's something l...
- What's the matter, Danny?
- Nothing.
Did you speak
to Father Franklin yet?
l stopped by this morning.
He's a Wonderful man.
He's knoWn me since
l Was a little girl.
He Was so happy l finally found
someone. He can't Wait to meet you.
- He's there noW if you...
- l can't, Nellie.
l Wouldn't knoW What to say to him.
That's Why l had to see you.
l think maybe too much
has happened too fast.
You're sWell and l don't Want to
hurt you, but something's happened.
A lot's happened. l Walked out
on Charlie LeGrand last night...
And noW you're making the parlay.
l guess so. For noW, anyWay.
That girl Ronnie, does she
have anything to do With it?
l don't knoW. Maybe.
lt's all kinda mixed up.
See, the other night...
l can't Walk in
that church till l'm sure.
l have to be getting
back to the store.
l can't afford to be fired
from tWo places in the same day.
Are you sure?
There's no use talking about it
any longer. A deal is a deal.
Mr Fields, l beg you.
l'm not here to speak for my son.
lt's my daughter.
Mr LeGrand has asked her
to marry him. l just found out.
He's counting on Danny
remaining at his club.
This could ruin their future,
her chance for happiness.
Your boy's gotta think about himself.
l can do more for him than Charlie.
- No, you don't understand.
- lt's you Who don't understand.
Mr Fields, the collector
made the delivery.
- Good.
- lt's all taken care of.
- Good deal.
- ls there anything else?
That the face of...
That's the one Who almost killed me.
You're mistaken.
This man Works for me.
Mistaken? l'm not mistaken.
l could never forget that face.
- What's he talking about?
- Beat it. Go on!
Wait. l don't care What
you do to me. l'll go to the police.
l don't think you Will. l don't think
you'll go to the police.
You say a deal is a deal.
l'll make you a deal.
Let Danny out of his agreement,
and l'll forget l saW this man.
Otherwise, l go to the police.
You're OK, Mr Fisher.
l gotta hand it to you.
But there's something you don't knoW
maybe make you change your mind.
Pa, What are you doing here?
lt Was an accident, Pa. l'm sorry.
Honest. l tried to stop 'em.
l did it for you!
- You double-crossed me, didn't you?
- Who sent for you?
- You told him.
- Sure, he Was running to the police.
- l told you l'd kill you.
- Knock it off, kid.
- l told you...
- l'm Warning you!
No! leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
- You tramp! l oWn you!
- No, you don't oWn me!
You bought me! You don't oWn me!
l meant to tell you that!
You disgust me! l hate you!
Every time you put your hands on me,
you make my flesh craWl!
Go ahead, hit me! That's the only
thing you're man enough to do!
Get out, Ronnie! Don't come back!
He's in the alley. Go around
the block. Come in the other Way.
Danny, We knoW you're in here.
You come on out noW
and you got a chance.
You can't get aWay.
Maxie's got the Whole toWn covered.
This is it, buddy.
This is the big get-even day.
We got a lot to settle up.
Danny, l kneW it Was
your old man that night.
l kneW it, and l slugged him anyWay,
so come and get me.
Come out and get me,
or We're coming in.
l'll let you in on a secret.
We've been laughing at you
ever since it happened.
You told me We'd tangle again.
Well, noW's your chance. Come on.
You got him?
Hold him. l Wanna put my mark on him.
Where is he?
Who's there?!
lt's me, Pa, Danny.
Let me in, Will you?
- Go aWay!
- l can't. Please, let me in, Pa.
Please...
Please let me...
l found out from Dummy What happened.
You've got to get out of here.
They're all after you.
You've got to hide.
Hurry, Danny. Hurry.
- Hello, Danny.
- Hello.
- HoW ya feel?
- l don't knoW yet.
You've been out of your head
for tWo days.
Maybe even longer.
Where are We?
Just some place to run to.
l've had this for years.
- What about Maxie? Does he...?
- No. Here there's no Maxie.
Here l don't have
to think about Maxie
or yesterday or today,
or the day after.
lt Was nice having
someone to take care of.
- Thanks. Thanks for everything.
- Sure.
- What are you staring at?
- You look like a kid.
l am. A 104-year-old kid.
l guess it all started that
first morning When you rescued me.
You had courage, and l admired that.
l have so little myself.
You'd be surprised at all
the happy endings l had figured out.
You see, Danny, girls like me,
if We stick around for the finish,
generally finish up
pretty much the same Way.
Sooner or later, the party's over.
We go to our hometoWns and marry the
first respectable guy Who asks us.
You'd be amazed hoW many do.
Only l never Wanted it that Way.
That's Why l kidded myself into
thinking maybe you Were the one.
l used to dream that maybe someday
Maxie and l Would be through,
and l'd meet you someplace,
and We'd run aWay.
We did.
lt's never the Way
you imagine it, is it?
Danny, l'm not proud.
l haven't got much pride left.
l knoW What can be and What can't be.
But do you think that
maybe for a little While you could
make it the Way l dreamed it?
That you could love me and...
my dream could come true?
- lt Wouldn't be hard to love you.
- Then love me, Danny.
Take a day out of your life
and love me.
Wait here.
lt Was a lovely day
for a little While.
Oh, no.
l'm sorry.
Danny, l'm so glad you're back.
- l hope noW We...
- Not yet, Nellie.
ln a little While, maybe,
but not noW.
l'll Wait.
l have lots of time.
lt'll be all right.
Good luck, Danny.
