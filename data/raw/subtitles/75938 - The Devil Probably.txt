THE DEVIL, PROBABLY
YOUNG MAN COMMITS SUICIDE
IN PERE LACHAISE
PERE LACHAISE 'SUICIDE WAS MURDER'
Six months earlier...
Your weight's on the left.
Then on the right.
The result...
You! Show me!
You can't walk.
Neither can you.
Nor you.
You can.
I'm calling for destruction.
Destruction is for everyone.
It's easy.
We can sway hundreds of thousands
with sloguns!
Destroy what? How?
You want to know everything,
so you never do anything.
-What will there be afterwards?
-It doesn't matter.
Anything would be an improvement.
We'd like to know the point of it all.
The Point? There is none!
Shut up!
-Our only strength...
-Drop it!
Half-wits, idiots.
Fools, the lot of them!
THE SOCIETY FOR THE CONSERVATION
OF MAN AND HIS ENVIRONMENT
And all around
thousands of dead trees.
X-ray of the legs of a bull in the area.
Destruction of birds and insects
beneficial to agriculture.
Rivers and oceans contaminated
by seepage.
Stabilizing of poisons in organisms
including man.
The risk of death still wouldn't
stop them.
It won't stop these either.
The tankers' effluent.
But don't they run any risk?
It's not only the noise...
But the release of oxides at thousands
of feet, destroying the ozone layer.
There'll be no more blue skies.
An earth ever more populated
and ever less habitable.
Destruction of entire species for profit.
280 species of birds and mammals
in about the last hundred years.
400,000 elephants.
And 1,000 rhinoceros
slaughtered in Kenya this year.
180,000 baby seals
for two million dollars.
-You know where you're going?
-Yes.
-Where?
-His place.
-He hasn't got one.
-He's got a room.
-It'll break you parents' hearts.
-I can't help that.
Do you love him that much?
You're the one I love, Michel.
With him it's something else, not love.
What then?
I don't know.
He asked me to be here at five.
He might not come at all.
Here he is!
Is it because Luther decided the host
became sacred only when swallowed...
...that unclean hands have passed it?
-Unclean?
-Hands unconsecrated by priesthood.
Montesquieu said Catholics would destroy
Protestantism...
...and then become Protestants.
You run after Protestants.
Is it because
you can live and think as you please?
We want to bring Christianity
into modern life.
-Who needs it?
-We've had enough of the old chiches.
But priests and the faithful
constantly pursue that aim.
Give us a break from your pursuit!
They meet daily to prepare 
the Church of tomorrow...
...to build a more logical Chirstianity.
Logical!
But all religions are illogical!
That's why, like it or not, the Christianty
of the future will be without religion.
You have to move with the times.
To hell with the times!
You're so civilised, so cultured
you and your priests.
It that why you music is dull,
and your hymns trite...
All those invented words and gustures
so oppressively insignificant.
God doesn't reveal himself
through mediocrity.
As you don't believe in the supernatural...
...at least share the fate of the poor
and oppressed with us.
There is great suffering.
A suburban vicar said to me:
"I'm bored!"
So are we! Let's go!
It's disgraceful!
What astounds me is how you
treat Edwige.
Take her dough,
but leave her alone.
Anyway, she loathes you.
What about you?
I'm not in the habit of making
my feelings public.
What makes you think I have
feelings for her?
Feelings?
-You're having her on!
-Edwige, is that true?
Charles, please. Don't interfere.
Leave us alone!
Where was I?
...accelerate the process
already begun...
"already begun, comma, through
books, films and drugs"
In spite of her airs, she's no idea
about intimacy.
She'll guess you don't love her.
Who says I don't?
Now go and hurry back.
I'll bring her to you.
We're leaving...
You want to go?
You can't leave me after
what's happened.
You know I've only come for an hour.
What are we waiting for?
Did you have to make me so happy?
Don't make matters worse by being stupid.
Poor little Edwige, what have you
done to yourself?
What is it to you?
You're not going to cry, too?
You just seem ridiculous and silly.
I'll never stop laughing at you.
I'm going.
It's such a bourgeois idea, such an
outdated prejudice!
A prejudice in never outdated.
You bore me to tears.
I thought if he didn't come back
I'd have to talk to you.
And did he come back?
What makes you think he won't.
Of course he will.
I know you weren't compatible.
You've nothing in common.
That's not true, but I'm his worst enemy
if I stop loving Edwige.
If I were sure he loved her,
I could decide...
I'd make the sacrifice.
-He wouldn't have that.
-I'm sure he didn't feel guilty.
There is a way:
Stop loving him and love someone else.
No, that's not it.
If you left him first
he'd come running.
Why are you always putting him down?
Me?
Look what I found among his things.
Cyanide! That's a dreadful poison.
There's this, too!
It's probably to frighten himself
or to frighten us.
-Hide it or throw it away.
-He's notice.
You must, but somewhere safe.
Where's Alberte?
What's the matter?
-I'll tell you everything.
-Don't tell me anything.
-No.
-Yes.
-No!
-Just that. Is it right?
You should know that the product
of that is prime, U over U.
Now clear off and stay out of my sight!
He's there. But he refuses to give lessons
or be paid for them. He won't do anything.
Why?
Isn't there a limit to doing nothing?
Yes, but beyond that you experince...
...an extraordinary pleasure.
What does Alberte say?
-I haven't asked, she dislikes questions.
-You treat her appallingly!
-Is this a sermon?
Don't go! Stay!
Tell me whom I love most,
Edwige or Alberte?
-You tell me.
-I don't know. You decide.
Well, Edwige, obviously.
Wrong! It's Alberte.
I've told Edwige, she agrees entirely.
Suppose you didn't love either?
He really told me off.
-That's not true.
-Please.
Not another word about me.
You'll make him tire of me.
I'll put him off me.
And don't give him a lift.
He insists.
He'll listen, but you won't convince him,
only reinforce his ideas.
Are you coming?
-You've destroyed the bottle?
-Yes.
-Did he notice?
-Of course.
Your new roads go through wood pulp?
They must be felled.
They're seedlings.
"SAVE OUR PLANET"
Do you know how civilisations end?
When stupidity is accelerated.
The growth of what?
Of happiness?
Happiness on credit, the credit card?
Or the happiness of walking in
the country and diving in the river?
All this is pretty well offical.
Red mud.
For years, 2,000 tons of chemicals
dumped in the Mediterranean every day.
Dumping it on the sea-bed now
is no better.
Mercury waste thrown into the sea
passed on to people through fish.
This can't be seen too often.
Fifteen years to react.
1-2% of world tonnage spread along
the coast and in the oceans.
And giant tankers are still launched.
It's up to science to save us! We'll
only be able to wave our limbs about...
...eat cakes and finally be
completely mad.
Do you want to go back
to living in caves?
I ask nothing. I lay claim to nothing.
No, you want to be exceptional
in an exceptional world.
And you? What do you stand for?
Well?
Progress, and brotherly love, love...
And you?
Me? Unbridled pleasure. Making love
like a beast, a wild animal.
Where are you going?
Do you know her?
What's wrong with you?
Open the door!
Open the door!
I was so frightened.
What happened?
You can't lie with your head 
underwater... and then wait.
It's not possible.
-Wait for what?
-I don't know.
This?
Idiot. 
Do you know what trouble
you could get me in?
Idiot.
Do you think I could kill myself?
-Not for a moment.
-Why?
Because if we were really done for
as you say...
...I'd still want to live
against all reason...
Without thinking, just for the sake of it?
Live for the life force.
But I'm certain all will be well.
Certain?
Not with my mind or intelligence...
-...with something else.
-You're right.
Look what I got.
Chocolates!
Don't worry, I don't need anything.
I get what I need from home
when there's no one there.
I've got the keys.
Isn't Charles here?
He might be angry with me
about the day before yesterday.
He hasn't been back since.
-Did you fight?
-No, but I let him know I was sad.
He spoke to me gently... 
...but his voice was so dry that I froze.
Usually it's me that comforts him.
Have you heard the news?
He's going to stay with Edwige
while her Dad's away.
I know he wants to.
Don't get indignant.
He'll be better off with her.
But I daren't encourage him
or he'll insist on staying.
I don't want him to be bored here
out of duty.
That would kill all his love for me.
Fancy, he brought me these...
Do you want one?
Are you mad? What's got into you?
-I knew you needed me.
-Yes, I need you, Michel...
...but not today, I'd rather
be alone today.
It's awful seeing you here.
Let's go out.
If my book's here, it's a bad sign.
It's not have the effect I intended.
He thinks it's great.
-How do you know?
-He told me.
He's trying to please you.
He knows we're friends.
He keeps it hidden.
I prefer that.
He's two faced. Come the revolution...
-There won't be any revolution.
-Why?
-It's too late.
-If you say so!
-You said so yourself, the other day!
-I did?
-It's tempting.
-What?
Nothing.
Can I borrow it?
I'll sell it to you. Put it down.
Has Charles got your gun?
-He was staring at the bullet.
-The bullet?
He probably wants a good look... 
...before he puts it in his head.
Charles!
He was here.
Charles!
Aren't you worried?
May I?
-You're shivering.
-No.
Yes you are.
Let's warm you up.
Here! Drink this!
I'm splitting.
Split!
All right.
Am I late?
I pray that you'll come back to life...
...so that I can hold you again
and kiss you like before?
I was dead?
Then I wake... and find you close.
It's so good.
You know I'll never leave you.
Yes, I'm getting married!
-To Edwige?
-To Alberte.
-It's the only solution.
-You really think so?
-There is no other.
-Here it comes.
-I'll come with you.
-No, don't.
Hasn't the limit for humans been
rather hastily assessed?
I don't think so.
It's 0.17 rem.
A rem is the effect produced...
...on the organism by 1 rad of radiation.
A rad is equivalent to 100 ergs per gram.
Do nuclear power stations... 
...apart from permanently
destroying rivers...
...preclude any threat of radioactivity
to the population?
If the precaution are insufficient
we'll adopt more.
The gases given off are mainly
krypton and tritium.
They require processing plants
and waste has to be stored.
Isn't there a risk in transporting
that waste?
Trains carrying uranium were derailed
in the US and Germany.
The containers remained intact.
That's a piece of luck.
Plutonium is more dangerous than uranium.
It lasts indefinitely.
Isn't the danger increased
by road transportation?
The engineers are handling
that problem.
Once stored, doesn't the waste
threaten drinking water?
The earth's drinking water is but
a drop on an orange.
And have earthquakes been considered?
And dumping the waste in the sea
as us customary...
...doesn't that mean the 
total destruction of marine life?
Ah well, it's the future generations
who'll pay.
The States are planning to
build 1,000 nuclear power stations.
It's thought the USSR will double that.
And you're not terrified by this growth?
No, not at all.
Why the atom and not solar energy
or tidal power?
Whose choice is it?
It's mainly dictated by the work
on armaments.
And they announce a masterpiece, a
missle that will kill 20 million people.
To reassure people, you simply 
have to deny the facts.
What facts? This is the supernatural.
You're unbelieveable!
Goverments are short-sighted.
Don't accuse governments. No goverenment
in the world can boast that it's governing.
It's the masses who determine events.
Obscure forces whose laws
are unfathomable.
Yes, something drives us against our will.
You have to go along with it.
And we do! So's not to be spoilsports.
So who is it that makes a mockery
of humanity?
Whose leading us by the nose?
The devil, probably.
"NO BATHING"
Do you find her selfish?
She lets me go, then she's sad. It's
worse than if she wouldn't let me go.
-Do you love him very much?
-Yes.
-If it's like that...
-What?
-You want him to be happy
-Yes, of course.
If it seems he'd be happier with you...
Perhaps I'm not the person to say this...
It's decided as you well know.
What's decided?
Leave us alone and don't get cross.
You stay!
-Did he tell you we were getting married?
-Yes.
He told me too, but it's just hot air.
-It calms him down.
-That's what I thought.
He's caught a live fish.
Quick, let's hide.
I've been told everything.
And I thought I should come to see you...
...in view of my interest in you.
I hope you'll let me come back.
You must not doubt my sincerity.
What will you do?
Make it up with your parents?
Go home?
Go back to the problems
that made you leave?
Or hang on to your freedom?
I can get you a good
position with a colleague... 
...or with me at the bookshop.
You'll never find a truer friend.
Let me prove it to you.
Get out! Take your money 
and get lost!
Your wrong.
I'm offering you protection.
-What happened?
-Nothing at all.
Why have you come?
All I've got left... an old sweater...
and the Coke bottles to take back.
-Love's over.
-You didn't love him.
Or you only loved him so you could
be generous and forgiving.
He wasn't faithful. 
He didn't know he 
didn't love me anymore.
You were only jealous
when he was away.
Leave me alone! Go away!
You're going to make me leave.
Go back home.
I don't want to.
Go away, please!
Are you there?
It's Valentin, he's back on drugs.
Quick.
Are you hungry?
-All right?
-Yes.
He says he's somewhere to go.
He's lying.
He's safe here in the meantime.
Lock him in if necessary.
I'll be back.
-Don't go right away.
-I'm no hurry.
No leave that.
Now you should go to bed.
Go to bed, yes. I'm going to bed.
Straight to bed.
Here.
They say you're mad here, too.
Victor Hugo says, on the subject of cathedrals:
"Such places are really holy."
But somewhere else he says:
"A church is divine..."
"...but if a priest appears
God is no longer present."
-He goes to far, don't you think?
-Oh, me and God, you know...
You're still going,
we're going together.
-On one condition.
-All right.
So you deny any part in breaking open
the boxes... 
-...or any part in the theft?
-That's right.
-And yet you weren't alone.
-True.
A second sleeping-bag bears that out.
-Who is it?
-I don't know his name.
He fled when you opened the doors.
He's far away.
And the leaflets?
I found them on the chairs
when I arrived.
I suppose you deny you meant to distribute
them like you did in St. Bernard's?
You're very clever... 
...but if I'd meant to do that...
...I wouldn't have screwed them up
in my pockets...
...and put them in the state in which
you found them on me.
Then what were you doing in St. Remy's
Church with that record player?
You refuse to answer?
No, but you wouldn't believe me
if I did.
Answer!
I don't won't any of your attention.
I must be left alone.
That stupid business has shaken him up.
He doesn't even think of getting up.
Only a great analyst like Dr. Mime
could help him.
-Yes, but will he agree?
-I have some addresses.
Yes, I've forgiven him.
But will you ever forgive me, Michel?
I've been awful to you.
What's going on in that heart?
Kiss me!
-He's escaped from his bed.
-When?
-I don't know.
-Where is he?
-How should I know?
Quickly, let's go!
How did this clash with society arise?
It's my normal state.
I kept it quiet for a long time.
Don't you get pleasure
form non-action?
Yes, but the pleasure of despair,
obviously.
-Do you feel guilty?
-Guilty?
Towards yourself?
Guilty without being so. 
I know I'm
more intelligent than the others.
I'm perfectly aware of my superiority.
But if I did anything, then I'd be useful
in a world that disgust me.
I'll betray my ideas. It would
only entrench me further.
I prefer to know that
there's no way out.
Begging in the streets...
-...isn't that degrading?
-Chairity degrades the doner as much as the recipient
Isn't that a good excuse for laziness?
Perhaps, but so what? 
If my aim was profit 
everyone would respect me.
Isn't being right
compensation for being alive?
In losing my life, here's what I'd lose!
Family planning. Package holidays...
...cultural, sporting, linguistic.
The cultivated man's library.
All sports.
How to adopt a child.
Parent-Teacher Association.
Education: 0 to 7 years,7 to 14 years,
14 to 17 years. Preparation for marriage.
Military duties.
Europe.
Decorations (honorary insignia)
The single woman. Sickness : paid.
Sickness : unpaid.
The successful man.
Tax benefits for the elderly.
Local rates. Hire purchase.
Radio and television rentals. 
Credit cards. Home repairs.
Index-linking. VAT and consumer.
Do you believe in God?
I believe, so far as possible
in eternal life.
But if I commit suicide,
I can't think I'm be condemned...
...for not comprehending
the incomprehensible.
How long have you been
thinking about death?
He's there, it's all right.
-Is it all right?
-Yes.
Often in my sleep I see myself murdered.
Dead. But I go on being hit.
I'm being trampled. It's awful.
All that for a holy cause.
When it's over, do you see yourself
as a martyr?
Only an amateur.
When I wanted to drown myself,
or pull the trigger...
...I realised it wasn't at all easy.
Is your father in your dreams?
It's not very clear.
What does he do?
Contractor in the provinces.
I'm not really sure.
He's rich. He pulls down trees
with machines.
A new up-surge of libido
in our Western world...
...might bring with it a destructive
counter-force.
What about your mother?
The richer he gets,
he more she love him?
-Do you make love?
Often.
It gives me feelings to cling to.
In your sexual relations, are you
aware of your girlfriends needs?
We don't have relations any more.
She was good in bed.
I thought that was love.
I've lost a marvellous girl.
When did you stop studying?
After higher maths. I organized
a sixth form cell at school.
And now you belong to 
left-wing groups?
Yes, or rather, no.
No more politics in your life?
The rejection of all politics.
-Do you have any problems with eating?
-Sometimes.
-I mean do you have an aversion to food?
-Not at all.
Loss of appetite often accompanies
severe depression.
I'm not depressed.
I just want the right to be myself.
Not to be forced to give up
wanting more...
...to replace true desires with false ones
based on statistics, on surveys, formulae...
... American-Russian scientific,
ultra-stupid classifications.
I don't want to be a slave
or a specialist.
Were you beaten as a child?
Try to remember.
I was spanked!
Do you know that the feeling of
being crushed by society...
...might well be the result of 
that spanking as a child...
...which associated with a painful dream
of being murdered for a great cause...
...would impede your psychological
development...
...and explain the root of your
disgust and your wish to die.
But I don't want to die!
Of course you do!
I hate life. But I hate death, too.
I find it appalling.
Look, leave it to me...
Come back in two days.
Thursday, same time.
But Doctor, I'm not ill.
My illness is seeing too clearly.
Of course... It's 200 francs a session.
Doctor.
-I don't think I ever could...
-Pay?
Make the gesture. At that instant
to stop thinking, seeing, hearing.
That's why the ancient Roman entrusted
a servant or friend with the task.
-He's saved
-You think so?
Edwige?
-I know he's selling one.
-And if he refuses?
He won't. Give him this.
What do you need it for?
You'll see. Just don't tell him
it's for me.
-But look...
-Go on! I'll wait for you here.
And the bullets...
It's loaded.
Goodbye.
-Will you do me a favor?
-No.
Worthy of the ancient Romans.
What ancient Romans?
Look!
That's all for you if you do as I ask.
Do what?
I'll tell you later. Come on.
I'll wait downstairs. Hurry!
Are you all right?
Let's get some air. Come on!
We're stopping here. Follow me.
A tot of something, anything, brandy.
-What about you?
-Nothing.
Let's go.
Can't you wait?
Where are we going?
Wherever you like. Here, or there?
I thought at a time like this
I'd have sublime thoughts.
Shall I tell you what...
.
