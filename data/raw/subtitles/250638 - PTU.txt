Now the headlines.
At North point this morning,
four gunmen robbed $18 million
from an armored car.
Driver, louder please!
One officer was shot in the head
and pronounced dead 15 minutes ago...
Another funeral to attend.
Idiot! What does he expect
charging in without backup?
I've worked with him before.
In one of the operations last year,
he was too nervous to hold the gun steady.
Where did he get the courage this time?
It's still early.
This means we can't have fun.
He should have saved it for the girls!
We'll finish the job for them.
Hey!
One of our comrades just died.
What would have happened
if Ga Loi heard this?
What would have happened
if his family members heard this?
He is still one of us.
Whatever it is, the most
important thing is getting home.
Ponytail. Five people?
There are seats here.
Let me get some beers for you first,
then I'll be back to take your orders.
Here are two beers.
Sorry, young man, please have
a seat at the next table.
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, Brother ponytail. Sorry.
Screw you.
Sorry, sorry.
You should know better.
Sorry. Is there a problem?
The air conditioner was leaking, bastard.
Sorry. Let me go get
the best beef for you.
Sorry, sorry.
- Did you want to park your car, Boss?
- Get lost!
Who are you?
Who are you?
- The butcher's grandson, Wai.
- Grandson?
- Is that how you speak to me?
- Sergeant! Sorry.
Kids can be so stupid and stuff.
They don't know anything.
Get down on your hands
and give me 50 push-ups.
Sorry!
Be more alert next time.
That's Sergeant Lo.
How could you not know him?
He's in charge of this territory.
Ridiculous! Bastard!
Such a dumbass!
He's so stupid!
You think you're all that?
Get moving! Hurry up!
Do more!
Lower. More.
What are you looking at?
Get lost! What?
Hurry up and do it!
15, 16, 17.
Sergeant, Sergeant.
Please share a table for now.
There will be seats open pretty soon.
Sorry, young man.
Please sit at the next table.
Sorry. I'll get some beers for you.
Please sit here.
Please sit here.
Brother ponytail, please have some beer!
Please help yourself.
- Sergeant.
- This side!
Put it down.
- Give me a large beer.
- Yes, yes, yes!
Brother ponytail, your dish will be right out.
Hello? Got it.
Okay, I'll be there.
You guys go to Sing Long and take a look.
Here is your beer, Sergeant.
Hello? Officer Chan.
Of course!
I will be there in ten minutes.
- Here's the money.
- Thank you very much.
Sorry, young man.
Let me get another table for you.
Hello? Yes.
Got it.
Bastard. He got me.
Go to the hospital.
Hey, over here.
Why is he here?
How should I know?
Are we still going to beat him?
You stupid? If we don't,
what are we going to tell ponytail?
Bastard! Motherfucker!
He wants to see you.
What happened, Fatty?
He said he fell.
Yeah! I did fall.
I fell and looked like a pig.
So what?
I'll talk to him.
Do you need an ambulance?
No, I don't need one!
He said he's fine.
There are no charges,
so the case is invalid.
Call pTI.
Fatty.
Where is your gun?
- Those bastards.
- I recognize those guys.
- They're ponytail's men.
- I'll deal with this myself.
Stop!
This is pTU Code #26316, over.
Next month is my promotion.
He lost his gun.
One night.
I will help him find his gun.
We can't support this.
You're such a coward.
- Your mother's a...
- A what?
- What?
- What?
Hey!
By morning, if I can't find it,
I'll report to the superintendant myself.
Code #26316, do you copy?
Yes. 123321.
Louder, please.
I can't understand you.
Hello, Fatty. Where are you?
Officer Chan. Sorry.
I can't make it to Mahjong tonight.
Forget about Mahjong.
We have a murder case here.
Hurry up and come!
I injured myself.
I'm not feeling very well.
The victim is ponytail.
Be right there!
Do you have the kind that a cop would use?
They're all here.
If there is, there is.
If not, then there is none.
- Do you have the ones in black?
- They're all here.
If there is, there is.
If not, then there is none, sir!
- Open the door.
- What's wrong, sir?
Let me see your license.
Here it is, sir.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Tell them to leave.
Did you hit your head?
Tell them to get leave.
I don't want to.
You gonna bite me?
Can we talk?
Sir, you don't have to frame us.
Get out.
Wait.
Come here.
Keep moving.
Keep moving.
Hey, you're dying.
You're dying. Keep playing.
What kind of tattoo is that?
It's so ugly.
Rub it off.
What do you want?
Call your cousin ponytail.
It's important.
No one is answering.
I cannot answer the phone right now,
but leave me a message.
Ponytail, this is Ben.
Give me a call back.
No one's answering.
- Who are you?
- Code #17647.
He was killed by a knife.
Did he get shot?
Thank you.
He didn't get shot.
- Fatty.
- Yes!
Hi, Officer Chan.
Whoa! What happened to you?
It's nothing.
I can take care of it.
Hello? Hello?
Hey, it's being handled by
the Criminal Investigation Department.
Why do you want to listen to it?
That might be ponytail's men.
What does that have to do with you?
We might be able to find some evidence.
- Why should we help them?
- Officer Chan!
Just forget about it!
Sir...
You don't need to speak to me.
Whatever it is, talk to them.
They'll be here soon.
Just wait.
Hey. Today, Fatty is a bit off guard.
Just looking at him, I doubt he can play.
Hey, go ask Bill if he wants to play.
Okay, Okay.
X-Y-L-E-N? No?
X-Y-L-E-M. Oh!
Officer Chan asks
if you want to play Mahjong.
How do you read X-Y-L-E-M?
Go check it out online.
Son, Daddy has something to do.
I'll tell you later.
- How much are we playing for?
- In cash?
- Hello?
- Ponytail?
- Who's looking for him?
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
Ponytail.
Who are you?
Hello?
Fatty.
Who are you?
Sergeant Ho. What is it?
Ponytail was killed.
I don't know.
Do you know if he took the gun?
He didn't tell me.
Talk to you later.
Thank you.
- Keep an eye on him.
- I will.
May I ask which unit you're from?
Inspector Cheng, with the CID.
- How's it going, Officer Chan?
- How's it going, Madam Cheng?
How's the investigation coming along?
We have all the reports.
We checked the alleys and the stairs,
but we found nothing.
All the stores are closed
and we couldn't find any witnesses.
- Check one more time.
- Yes, madam!
Sing, check one more time.
Where is the taxi driver?
He got so scared,
he checked into the mental hospital.
- Everything is here?
- Everything is here.
There, it's all clear.
Tell everyone to leave.
Got it. Please sign.
You're missing a phone.
Oh, right!
Hey, have you made a mistake?
Right! I wrote more than needed.
Let me correct it.
Was it really a mistake?
- Was it really a mistake?
- We're all comrades.
- Did you really need to...
- Are you defending him?
- At least give him time to think about it.
- Fine!
Hey, Bill. You dropped it!
You're so clumsy!
Thank you, thank you.
Here it is. Sign for it.
All clear?
This is pTU Code #26316, over.
- How can I help you?
- Thank you.
There is a parked car here
on the south side of the street, over.
Roger, over.
The glass on the driver's side
of the window is shattered.
The driver is out of sight.
Did anyone call
about this problem, over?
This is pTU Code #26316, over.
Yes.
There's another car on this side of the street
with its windows shattered, over.
Roger.
Buddy.
You don't need to report to the superintendant?
What's up?
I'm looking for Sergeant Ho.
He's busy right now.
Hey!
Wait.
Ou Dat Lei is here.
What's wrong, Officer?
You have asthma.
Yes, yes. I have asthma.
Do you know ponytail's men?
Are you talking about the four guys
that hang around him?
Where are they?
Mian Deng Geng.
In that old building,
in a room on the third floor.
Are you lying to me?
No, no!
You know I can find you.
Of course you can find me.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
Do you need to go to the hospital?
No.
You said you have asthma.
You don't feel well, right?
Yes. I've been like this
ever since I was young.
All right, then. Please don't say
that I was the one who told you.
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?
- Are you able to walk?
Are you feeling dizzy?
I'm not feeling dizzy anymore.
- Can you drive?
- Yes.
Okay, okay.
Drive safely.
Sergeant Ho.
- What is it, Ou Dat Lei?
- Nothing.
There was nothing to do at the office
so I wanted to come
and learn something from you.
You want to learn something?
Go help check on the cars.
The superintendant approved the request.
Did he send you to check on us?
No.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Sergeant Ho!
What is it?
Let's forget about
Fatty's business, Sergeant.
Tell Fatty to deal with it himself.
There's no point in us all
getting in trouble because of him.
Especially when Ou Dat Lei is here.
For those who don't want
to continue, that's fine.
By morning, if I can't help him,
then that's unfortunate.
Fatty! Are you trying to hide from us?
What's up, Uncle Fatty Chen?
Everyone is looking for you.
We called you so many times
and you never answered.
No, you didn't.
The phone didn't ring.
Oh, the battery is out.
Do you have a spare?
Everybody is looking for Eye Ball,
saying he killed ponytail.
He had nothing to do with it.
His guys acted on their own.
I have nothing to say about that case.
It's being handled by the CID.
I'm not telling you to follow it.
They want us to watch out for them.
We can neither threaten them
nor beat them.
You can't really stop them for long.
Many of them have died.
You know what to do.
After you're finished, give us a call.
Next time, remember to give me
back my battery.
Hello?
Wrong number.
Any news about Eye Ball?
Get out of here.
Call me if there's any news.
Yes, madam.
Better clean yourself up.
We can't protect you forever.
Being an undercover,
I know what I signed up for.
Police! Don't Move!
Quiet!
Quiet!
Put down the knife.
Put down the knife.
Wipe it off.
Wipe it off!
If only you were in my shoes!
Where are ponytail and the gang?
The son of a bitch took them with him!
Who did this?
How the fuck should I know?
How long have they been gone?
Just now.
Do you want me to call the police?
Do you want help from the police?
This is Fatty.
I can't come to phone right now.
Please leave me a message.
- Hello?
- Fatty?
Wrong number.
I'm sorry.
I said you got the wrong number!
Is this 992-7727?
No! This is not Fatty!
Give it to me.
Who's looking for Fatty?
Hello? Hello?
Find out whose phone this is
and all the incoming calls.
Yes, madam.
Hello?
Wrong number!
- Hello?
- Ponytail?
Wrong number. There's no ponytail!
What number are you calling?
Ponytail! Cheung has been killed!
Hello? Who is this?
Who is this?
How did you get this number?
Bald Head?
Bald Head.
I'm looking for Bald Head.
Wait here.
Did you just come back
from a hot pot meal?
Yes.
They're all here!
Why are you looking for them?
Don't play games with me.
You know why.
I know you had
an argument with my son!
I know you have my son's phone,
I know Eye Ball killed my son,
and I know you've had a discussion
with Eye Ball before, right?
Don't blame me.
The reason I looked for them
is to get my gun back.
I can't take this.
All I want is to get my gun back.
I want you to find Eye Ball...
and I'll return the gun to you.
You obviously want me dead, then!
I'm a cop!
My son is dead, and you're
still alive and unharmed!
My son is dead, and you're
still alive and unharmed!
My son is dead.
Hello?
Mike, it's me, Fatty.
What happened?
The gang is kidnapped.
I know. Where are you?
I need to talk to you.
I'm heading to
the Chinese restaurant for tea.
I'll meet you there.
Madam, the phone does belong to Fatty.
Hello? Eye Ball, it's Fatty.
It's all been taken care of.
Inform the Organized Crime
& Triad Bureau.
Okay. Don't worry.
We're closed!
What is it?
This morning, at 4 a. M...
- Hi, madam. So late?
- Yeah.
- Service, please!
- Yes, right away.
What would you like?
Just coffee.
What's going to happen?
4 a.m., avoid Canton Road.
Can you do that?
Did you find your gun?
It's already 2 a.m.
I'll take care of it at 4 a.m.
Help me out.
We're closed!
CID.
Have you seen the driver
of the paint-drenched car parked outside?
What? He's upstairs.
Thank you.
Thank God your car is easy to identify.
Is this phone yours?
Oh, I had my phone
mixed up with ponytail's,
and I answered his phone by mistake.
Nothing is up, really.
But someone called the phone
and was looking for you.
Huh?
What's the story with Fatty?
I don't know, madam.
I just happened to bump into him.
What's up with Fatty?
I don't know, madam.
I just happened to bump into him, too.
What's up with Fatty?
I really don't know, madam.
Madam.
If anything happened to Fatty,
you'll all be responsible!
Bald Head, it's Fatty.
Take me to Canton Road at 4 a.m.
Hey, buddy, do you have any coins?
- Hey, buddy.
- Don't worry about it.
This is Xiao Er.
I'm sorry I can't come...
Hello?
It's me, madam.
Any leads?
Yes, I have news about
Eye Ball and Bald Head.
Good.
Drive.
This is Xiao Er.
I'm sorry...
Sorry.
- Hello?
- It's me.
So?
I really have nothing to do with it.
It's those smart-ass youngsters.
Well, do you believe that
I don't have your gun then?
Kill Eye Ball, then you can
have your gun back.
And we'll all forget about this.
You better keep your promise.
Car keys.
Boss, I'll have the boys come with you.
Don't follow me!
If Eye Ball isn't dead by tonight,
what will people think of me?
Follow him.
Sergeant, we should go now.
It's 4 a.m.!
Go check out those two
and question them thoroughly.
Yes, sir!
Don't be a smart-ass, officer.
Why are we avoiding Canton Road?
Call the inspector
and find out where he is.
- And get yourself back there.
- What should I tell him?
Should I say Fatty told you
not to go to Canton Road?
Whatever you want to say.
Didn't you say "Same uniform, same family"?
I, too, am wearing a uniform!
You know that it's not right!
You're putting him in danger.
We'll all get in trouble for this!
It's not too late to stop him.
Son of a bitch.
- Hello?
- Has the boat arrived?
Yes, it's here.
We're at the corner of the street,
on our way now.
Okay.
Come on, pick up the phone!
I'm here.
Turn around.
Damn you, Fatty!
You killed my son!
Damn you, Fatty!
- This is pC #23781, over.
- Go ahead.
Please send an ambulance
to Canton Road.
What happened?
We had a shoot-out a moment ago
and there are six of us wounded.
Everything is under control.
- How many wounded?
- Six.
Who are they?
We don't know yet,
but we're investigating it right now.
Roger.
PTU Bravo 2 Commander, over.
Yes, I got it.
Anyone from the team hurt?
No, we're all fine, sir.
Okay. I'm on my way now.
Roger.
Sorry.
Fire a few shots, it'll be easier
for you to write the report
and to receive praise, madam.
I found the gun in the back alley.
I'm Sergeant,
code number 7366, Mike Ho,
currently stationed in Sub-Unit 2
of the air squadron.
I'm Inspector Cheng Li-Guan,
code number 56472,
currently stationed
in the Criminal Investigation Department
based in Kowloon Headquarters.
I'm Chief Inspector,
code number 764763, Lo Sa,
based in Tsim Sha Tsui,
Anti-Triad Unit Number 2.
Friday, September 15th, 2000.
When I was investigating a murder case...
At about 4 a.m.,
when my unit patrolled Canton Road,
we encountered four suspicious men,
so we went to investigate.
They resisted and opened fire at us.
I passed by Canton Road
while off duty and was caught...
in the middle of the confrontation
between the police and the mob.
So I offered assistance and fired two shots.
At this time,
one mobster tried to escape.
I chased after him
all the way to the back alley.
He then aimed his gun at me.
I was forced to fire back.
I fired two shots at him.
In the end,
all four suspects were killed.
