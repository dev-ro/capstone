Fitzgerald
Make Nick Carraway
So Dull?
What's The Point Of Having
Such A Boring Narrator?
I Think It Was
A Bad Choice.
Well, Carraway Is
Like A Camera.
He's Fascinated
By Gatsby,
So He Wants To Create
A Portrait Of Him.
Look, In A Way,
The Book Is Kind
Of A Love Letter
To Gatsby.
- Love Letter?
- Sure.
- I Guess.

You Have Been An Excellent

In Light Of This,
We Have Decided
We're Willing
To Recommend You
For Positions Elsewhere.
Thank You.
Actually,
For Some Time Now
I've Considered Moving

Don't You?
 <I>If You Need</I>

So There Are A Few Things
I'd Need To Know About You,
If You Haven't
Lost Interest.
Would You Prefer
To Leave Or Continue?

Louis Ives.
Those Christmas Balls
Are Very Interesting.
I Love Them.
 <I>I Love Their Colors,</I>

If You Ever Want
To Give Me Something,
You Can Give Me
Christmas Balls.
- Okay.
- So Tell Me...
Louis Ives,
Why Are You Moving
To New York?
( CLEARS THROAT )
I'm Sort Of Looking
For Myself.
You Won't Find Yourself
In New York.
If I Had To Move Anywhere,
I'd Move To Russia.
 <I>Far Less Expensive.</I>
Well, I've Been Teaching
Now For Several Years,
So As Far As The Rent
Is Concerned,
I've Saved Enough
From Working
In Princeton--
Princeton?!
How Is Princeton
These Days?
It Was Great Once,
But Then They Let Women In.
Oh, You Mean
The University.
It's Still Excellent.
And There's No Reason Women
Shouldn't Go To College.
I'm Against
The Education Of Women.
( LAUGHS )
It Dulls Their Senses
And Affects Their
Performance In The Boudoir.
The Women I Like Best
Are The Hasidic Women.
They Really Get It.
 <I>What Were You Teaching?</I>
English Literature.
We're Colleagues Then.
- I Teach Composition
At Queens College.
- Oh.
Primarily,
I'm A Playwright.
Really?
Have I Seen
Any Of Your Work?
Sadly My Great Opus Was
Stolen By A Swiss Hunchback,
But That's All Too Tragic
To Go Into Now.
 <I>You Know, Fitzgerald Wrote</I>
 <I>With Great Love</I>
About Princeton
In "This Side Of Paradise."
Do You Like Fitzgerald?
 <I>He's One Of My</I>
 <I>Favorite Authors.</I>
Of Course I Like
Fitzgerald.
 <I>But There Won't Be</I>
 <I>Anymore Of His Kind</I>
 <I>Coming Along Soon.</I>
You Need
An All-Male Environment
To Shape Up
A Young Writer.
The Muslims Might Produce
Another Fitzgerald.
They're Very Good
At Separating The Sexes.
On The Subject Of...
( CLEARS THROAT )
 <I>The Sexes,</I>
Just Out Of Curiosity,
What Is Your Policy
Regarding Guests?
As In...
Overnight Guests?
- Uh...
- No.
No, Absolutely Not.
No. No, This Place
Is Far Too Small.
There's To Be
No Fornication!
No, I Wouldn't
Even Conceive
Of Having Sex In Here.
I'm Retired From All
That Anyway.
I Didn't Mean To Be Rude,
I Was Just--
This Has Gone On
Long Enough.
We're Obviously Compatible.
You're The Only Person
Who's Come For The Room
Who Speaks English.
 <I>So What Will It Be,</I>
 <I>Yes Or No?</I>
( GRUNTS SOFTLY )
I Would Prefer
To Think About It.
- <I>( CELL PHONE RINGING )</I>
- Waiter: Be Right Back.
- Hello?
- So Have You
Thought About It?
Oh, Hello.
Yes. Actually,
I Just Was--
And?
Well...
( CLEARS THROAT )
I'm Feeling...
That I Should Wait Until
I'm Certain About A Job.
No No.
No No No No.
We Should Do This.
We Should Settle Now.
 <I>You CAN PAY BY THE WEEK</I>
 <I>UNTIL YOU HAVE A JOB.</I>
Plus There's Much I Can
Teach You About New York.
I Can Advance You
Socially.
All This Will Be
Very Good For You.
That's Certainly
Very Considerate Of You
To Think That Way.
Very Good, Then.
I'll See You
On The First Of The Month.
I'm Glad This Worked Out.

- Hmm.
- What Are You
Reading There?

He's Unreadable.
 <I>His Early Work</I>
 <I>Wasn't As Bad.</I>
He Burned Himself,
You Know?
He Sat On A Stove
And Shriveled His Testicles.
That May Account
For His Sudden Change

- Nice To Meet You.

And With You, George.
- Thank You For Taking Me On.
- You're Welcome, Louis.

Come On.
Cough It Up.
Oh, Hey.
Let Me Help You
With That, Henry.
What Service.
You'd Make An Excellent
Valet Or Squire.
Henry, Maybe Next Time
We Should Try And Recycle
Your Wine Bottles.
Why?
Recycling Is
The Most Insidious Idea
Of This Generation.
That And Helping
The Homeless,
 <I>Most Of Whom Deserve</I>
 <I>The Position.</I>
What The Government Should
Really Focus On Is Sex.
 <I>If We Could</I>
 <I>Control That,</I>
We Could Solve Anything.
So You See Sex
As The Cause Of All
Of Society's Problems?
Absolutely.
You'll Find I'm
To The Right Of The Pope
On Most Of These Issues.
Well, Anyway,
If I May Change
The Subject,
You Look Very Nice.
Are You Going Out Somewhere?
Yes, I'm Seeing
The Billionairess
Vivian Cudlip This Evening.
She Phoned Me
About An Event
Only 10 Minutes Ago,
But The Queen
Must Be Obeyed.
- Wow, A Billionairess.
- Mmm.
And To Think
A Lowly Fellow Like Me
Was About To Treat You
To Dinner.
I Had A Banner Day.
I Even Got A Job.
Congratulations!
I Knew You Were A Man
Who Could Pay The Rent.
What Type Of Position?
- It's At A Magazine.
- Mmm.
An Environmental Journal.
I'm Sure It's
All Just A Front
For Pornography.
- ( HORN HONKS )
- Ah, This Is My Ride.
We Must Celebrate
Your Getting A Job.
Tomorrow Evening.
I'll Take You
To The Opera.
I Know A Wonderful
Little Company.
My Treat.
Thank You, Herbert.
Good Night.
Good Night.
- This Way.
- Woman: <I>Excuse Me.</I>
Excuse Me, I Had
My Eye On That First.
The Doorman Was Watching
This Pile For Me.
Henry:
Bloody Hell, I Forgot It
Was Trash Day.
Oh, Well.
Are You Sure About Going
To The Opera Tonight?
I Hear It's
Astronomically Expensive.
Don't-- Don't Be
So Middle-Class.
The Aristocracy
Never Pays.
 <I>Here's My Car.</I>
( HUMMING )
- Maybe We Should
Take A Cab?
- Why?
I Go Everywhere
In My Electra.
I Drive All
Around Manhattan
Looking For "It."
I Mean "It"

Why Do You Have
Florida Plates?
Because I Live There

 <I>That's Where</I>

- Please, Be Careful!
- Ohh!

Don't Be Such A Milquetoast.
As Napoleon Said,
- "If Rape Is Imminent..."
- Henry!
- "...Relax And Enjoy It!"
- Woman: <I>Asshole!</I>
All Right,
Here's How It's Done.
The Intermission Is
About To Begin.
So When You See Somebody
Coming Out,
You Simply Say,
"Oh, Are You Leaving So Soon?
Well, If You Are,
May I Have Your Ticket
And Your Re-Entry Stub?"
Now, You Have
To Get The Re-Entry Stub.
That's Very Important.
Without It,
The Ticket Is Useless.
- Do You Understand?
- I Think So.
Henry, Henry!
I Got Two Tickets!
Shh, Shh.
And The Re-Entry Stubs?
Well, One Stub,
But I Think--
Didn't I Tell You
It Was Crucial To Get
The Re-Entry Stub?
Which Part Of That
Didn't You Understand?
She Only Took One.
Why Are You Yelling At Me?!
- You Didn't Get Anything.
- That's Irrelevant.
The Point Is
Without The Re-Entry Stub
The Ticket Is Useless.
- <I>( MUSICAL TONES PLAY )</I>
- Show Time, Darling.
Oh Dear. Well,
We're Going To Have
To Try To Sneak In.
All Right.
Here's A Program.
That Will Help.
You Go First,
I'll Be Behind You.
I'll Be Senile,
You'll Be Angry.
We'll Bluff
Our Way In. Go.
( SINGING )
Where Is--
Where's My Re-Entry Stub?
I Had It.
Did You Take It?
I Hand It To You?
- No.
- I Must Have Handed
It To You.
No, You Didn't,
Father!
For Heaven's Sake,
Try To Remember Where
You Put Things!
Did You Check
Your Pants?
- I'm Wearing Them!
- Just Go In.
Thank You.
Terribly Sorry 
About All That.
That's Not Bad.
With A Bit
Of Direction
From Me,
You Could Land Yourself
A Walk-On Part Somewhere.
Perhaps Off Broadway.
 <I>( SINGING IN Italian )</I>
She's Russian,
You Know.
Only Russia Can Still
Produce Women Like That.
Henry:
 <I>So There We Are.</I>
Where Are We?
Sorry?
I Like To Say That
Sometimes Before Retiring.
 <I>I'm About To Put In</I>
 <I>My Ear Plugs.</I>
Any Final Thoughts,
Questions?
Yes. Can We Go
To The Opera Again Soon?
Why Not?
We Can Afford It.
Oh, Henry,
One More Thing.
I Never Got To Ask You,
How Did Your Evening
With The Billionairess Go?
With Vivian?
It Was Fine.
Except She Stopped Breathing
For A Full Minute.
But Then She Rallied.
She Always Does.
How Old Is She?
She's 92.
- 92?!
- <I>Yes.</I>
That's A Little Old
For A Girlfriend,
Don't You Think?
Unfortunately,
She's Not My Girlfriend.
I'm Just One
Of 20 Sycophants, Really.
 <I>For Years Now I've Been</I>
 <I>Her First Choice,</I>
 <I>But I Could Be On The Outs</I>
 <I>At Any Minute.</I>
Barry Barbarash Wants
Desperately To See Me Omitted.
 <I>He's Scheming</I>

 <I>It's A Knight</I>

An Escort.
Henry...
Are You A Gigolo?
Don't Be Disgusting.
I Am An "Extra Man."
Although I Would Argue
I'm So Much More Than "Extra."
 <I>I'm Essential.</I>
Do These Old Ladies
Pay You?
Of Course Not,
Except In Pleasure--
 <I>A Fine Meal,</I>
 <I>Vintage Champagne...</I>
 <I>An Orchestra Perhaps.</I>
 <I>You See,</I>
 <I>Women Outlive Men,</I>
 <I>So There's Always A Need</I>
 <I>For An Extra Man</I>
 <I>At The Table.</I>
 <I>It Maintains A Proper</I>
 <I>Seating Arrangement.</I>
 <I>Boy-Girl, Boy-Girl.</I>
 <I>But Don't Think</I>
 <I>For A Moment</I>
 <I>That It's All Champagne</I>
 <I>And Stardust.</I>
 <I>An Extra Man Must Be</I>
 <I>Extremely Vigilant,</I>
 <I>Especially When Dancing.</I>
 <I>That's Why Escorts Are</I>
 <I>Often Called Walkers.</I>
 <I>I, However,</I>
 <I>Am No Mere Walker.</I>
 <I>What I Bring Is</I>
 <I>The Complete Package--</I>
Wit, Intelligence,
 <I>An Uncommon</I>
Joie De Vivre.
I Wish I Had
 <I>Joie De Vivre.</I>
 <I>Then I Could</I>
 <I>Be Your Assistant.</I>
You're Very Young.
 <I>But Vivian Does Have</I>
 <I>A Rather Attractive Niece.</I>
- She Might Like You.
- That Would Be Incredible.
Are We Having
A Conversation?
Yes, I'd Say So.
Well, It Has To Stop.
We Should Know As Little
About Each Other As Possible.
 <I>Good Relationships</I>
 <I>Have This Foundation.</I>
 <I>Now Good Night.</I>

To Get In For Free.
Or We Could Just Go

But I'm Going

- Oh.
- We're Protesting

Of A Cement Plant

Is Taking Me.
Maybe You And I Could
Grab Lunch Out Together

Over The Years,
I've Had Very Few Lovers--
And You're Lonely.
And You Desire
The Company Of A Woman.
And You Know What,
That's As Good A Reason
As Any To Start Crossdressing.
So Let's Get You Into Some
Lingerie, Sweetheart.
 <I>( TOILET FLUSHES )</I>
 <I>You Look Very Nice.</I>

So The First Thing

Is Teach You
To Be Feminine.

Gonna Learn How To Sit.
Go Ahead.
No No No No.
Okay.
See How Your Foot Is
Pointed Up Like That,
All Tense And Full
Of Aggression?
A Man's Foot
Does That
Because They're Always
Trying To Get Somewhere.
Try Relaxing

Relax. Good.

- That's Not What I'm After.
- Don't Interrupt, Georgina,
It's Rude!
Maybe It's Time
For Your Spanking.
- We Don't Have To Do That.
- Yeah, We Do. Get Up!
- Put Yourself
Across My Knee.
- Okay.
- You Bad Boy!
- Whoa!
- Talking Back!
- Ow!
Ow Ow Ow!
Ow Ow Ow!
Miss Hart, Can We Stop?
 <I>Why?!</I>
Would You--
Would You Mind
If I Just Kissed You?
( SCOFFS )
You Don't Have
To Ask, Sugar.
You're Paying.
 <I>( TIMER BELL RINGS )</I>
Ow.
Ow.
You're Later Than Usual.
What?! Yes.
I Went Out For Drinks.
Actually, I'm Sort Of Seeing
This Girl From Work.
Oh, That Sounds
Like A Lie.
But That's Good.
 <I>That Shows That</I>
 <I>You're Growing Up.</I>
 <I>By The Way,</I>
 <I>Have You Seen</I>
 <I>My Eye Mask?</I>
It's Disappeared
Mysteriously.
- No.
- <I>I Certainly Hope</I>
 <I> It Turns Up.</I>
I Can't Sleep
Without It.
By The Way,
I Got The Mail On My Way Up.
Ohh...
Oh, Speaking Of Which,
I Forgot To Mention This--
Never Answer The Door.
It Could Be The Irs.
Okay.
Who's Otto Bellman?
Who, Bellman?
He Was Your Predecessor.
Oh. How Long Did
He Live Here?
Two Years.
It Was A Great Mistake.
At First It Wasn't Awful.
He Looked Like
Sophia Loren In Profile.
Of Course...
He Had A Hunchback.
You're Putting The Mail
In The Freezer?
Only His Letters.
I Can't Afford To Lose Them.
He's Already Hell-Bent
On Revenge Against Me.
Why?
- Because I Kicked Him Out.
- Really?
For Being
A Sexual Deviant.
Oh.
He Had One Of Those
Bondage Magazines.
He's Swiss--
They Like All That S&M,
You Know?
Can You Believe
He's Actually Living
With Vivian Cudlip's
Granddaughter?
And What Is Worse,
He Stole The Only Copy
Of My Greatest Play.
"Henry And Mary
Are Always Late."
 <I>The Degenerate Is Probably</I>
 <I>Gonna Have It Produced</I>
 <I>Illegally In Zurich</I>
And Make Himself
A Grand Fortune.
I Think You're Being
Unreasonable.
You're The One Always
Citing These Great Authors.
Most Of Them Had All Kinds
Of Unusual Kinks.
That's Irrelevant.
One Should Only Have Sex
When Married.
Have You
Ever Been Married?
No.
Are You Saying
You've Never Had Sex?
You'll Get
Nothing Out Of Me.
 <I>And Try Thinking</I>
 <I>About More Important Things.</I>
Think About Defrosting
That Icebox In There
To Make Room
For More Mail.
 <I>That's What I Do.</I>
 <I>I Don't Go Around Needing Sex.</I>
I Don't Need Any Love.
You're Being Dishonest.
Everybody Needs Something.
All I Need Is Pleasure.
Okay, So What
Gives You Pleasure?
I'd Like To Go
Back To Anapa.
 <I>It's A Small Town</I>
On The Black Sea
In Russia.
Vivian And I Went There
Years Ago On Our World Tour.
 <I>A Bottle Of Champagne</I>
 <I>Only Cost $4.</I>
In My Mind's Eye,
That's Where I Think
I'd Be Happiest.

Henry,
Do You Know That Man?
Henry:
 <I>That's Gershon Gruen.</I>
 <I>Oh, Your Friend</I>
 <I>Who Carries Things?</I>
 <I>Yes, And Fixes My Car.</I>
It's Obvious He's Still
Not Speaking To Me.
He's Always
On That Bike.
Yes, He's Cycling Away
His Sex Drive.
Gershon Was A Slave
To His Libido.
He Used To Bring Prostitutes
From The Bronx
Into His Apartment,
And They Would
Steal Things.
He Couldn't Stop,
So He Turned To Me For Help.
I Told Him To Develop
Other Interests,
Like Reading The Dictionary
To Improve His Vocabulary
And Bicycle Riding,
Which So Far
Has Worked Wonders.
Of Course, He's Still
An Obsessive Masturbator.
If Your Advice Worked,
Then Why Isn't
He Speaking To You?
He Claims That I Don't
Really Want His Friendship,
That I Am Only Using Him
For His Mechanic Skills.
Also, I Think He Was Jealous
Of My Relationship
With Your Predecessor
Otto Bellman.
You Have A Strange Power
Over People, Henry.
It's My Constant
Disapproval.
Some Find It Fatherly.
No! Enough!
I Think It's Silly
You Made Us Sit
At Separate Tables
Like This.
Men Of Any Worth
Sit Across From Women.
If You Ever Want
To Be An Extra Man,
You Have Much To Learn
About Boy-Girl Propriety.
Which Reminds Me, What Are
You Doing Tomorrow Evening?
Nothing. Why?
I Have Two Lady Friends
Who Need Escorting To An Event.
Vivian Cudlip
And Her Niece?
No, But Almost
As Important.
Would This Officially
Make Me An Extra Man?
Extra, Yes.
But Nowhere Near Essential.
 <I>( French MUSIC PLAYING )</I>
Henry, What Are
You Doing?
I Forgot To Buy Socks.
Mine Are All
Threadbare.
Don't Worry,
No One Will Notice.
Who Knows, Maybe It'll
Help Kill The Fleas.
Fleas?
Yes. Fleas.
My Dermatologist
Confirmed I Have Them.
Henry:
 <I>Now Listen Carefully--</I>
One Of The Women
We're Escorting
This Evening, Lois Huber,
Has Given Me A Room
In Her Palm Beach Home
 <I>For The Last</I>
 <I>Four Seasons.</I>
- Okay.
- Unfortunately,
I Said Something
That Offended Her,
 <I>And We Had</I>
 <I>A Falling Out.</I>
What Did You Say
That Offended Her?
I Told Her That Her
Ass Is Big,
That She's A Saddle-Back
And Possibly A Moral Imbecile.
Henry, That Seems Like
A Lot To Recover From.
That's Where
I'm Counting On You.
I'm Hoping That Your Youth
Will Have A Positive
Effect On Her.
The Other Woman,
Meredith Lagerfeld,
Has Nothing
To Offer Socially.
She's Dirt Poor.
In Fact, We Often Work
In Unison At Events.
She's The One Who Alerted Me
That Lois May Be Ready
To Forgive Me.
- <I>That Was Nice Of Her.</I>
- Not Really.
Lagerfeld Uses Me
For Rides.
She's Gotten Quite Enormous,
You See,
And Has Trouble Getting
Around Town.
 <I>Speak Of The Devil.</I>
 <I>My God, Look At Her.</I>
She Does Have Nice Hair.
 <I>I Suppose We All</I>
 <I>Have Something,</I>
 <I>Even Lagerfeld.</I>
Henry, Focus.
The George Gillies
Have Just Arrived.
She's Hosting Quite A Large
Party On Thursday.
I Think We Should Try
To Speak To Her.
They're Friends
Of Vivian Cudlip's.
Mention The Name Vivian Cudlip
And We'll Be In.
Meanwhile,
Where The Hell Is Lois?
Oh, Lois, For Heaven's Sake.
She's Over By The Klimt.
Hmm. Excuse Us.
Louis.
Oh, Terribly Sorry.
- There's A Dwarf
In That Picture.
- It's A Child, Henry.
Yes, Quite Right.
Speaking Of Children,
I'd Like To Introduce You
To My Young House Guest
Louis Ives.
Louis Has Recently Come
To New York To Find Himself.
Lois, Louis,
Louis, Lois.
Rolls Off The Tongue Rather
Nicely, Doesn't It?
I Need Some More Wine.
I Rea--
( CLEARS THROAT )
I Really Like
These Paintings.
I Don't.
It's Ridiculous How Nobody
Really Looks At Them.
I Was Admiring
Your Outfit Before.
It's Very Interesting.
And A Good Color
For You Too.
And How Old
Are You, Louis?
Old Enough.
Tell Me, Are You
By Chance From Russia?
Me?
( CHUCKLES )
God, No.
I'm As American
As They Come.
Not To Me.
What Exactly Do You Do
With Magazines, Louis?
I Work On The Marketing
Side Of Things,
But I'd Like
To Be An Editor
Or Writer Someday.
Ah. Henry's
An Excellent Writer.
A Talented Playwright.
But He Can Be
A Very Rude Man,
You Know.
- Ah.
- Meredith: Hello, Lois.
With The Exception
Of That Russian Bartendress,
I've Never Experienced
A More Dreary Crowd.
Stop Complaining, Henry.
It's Tiresome.
Well, There Is Another
Opening At The Whitney,
But It's Not Until 9:00.
Then I'll Need
Dinner First.
We'll Eat At My Place.
Meredith Will Ride Over With Me,
Henry And Louis Can Go
Pick Up The Food.
- <I>Come, Dear.</I>
- That's Awfully Nice, Lois.
 <I>Things With Lois Are Worse</I>
 <I>Than I Had Imagined.</I>
Your Youth
Has Failed Us
And I'm Off My Game.
I Haven't Been Sleeping Right
Since My Eye Mask Disappeared.
 <I>We'll Have No Choice</I>
 <I>But To Implement Plan B</I>
 <I>Over Dinner.</I>
Next.
There's No Bathroom In Here
And I Have To Piss.
If I'm Not Back In Time,
Get Two Roasted Chickens.
Lois Has Millions
Of Dollars,
But There's Nothing
She Likes Better Than
Roasted Chicken.

 <I>As The Young Gentleman</I>
 <I>Stood There On Line,</I>
 <I>He Couldn't Help But Play</I>
 <I>The First Half Of The Evening</I>
 <I>Over And Over</I>
 <I>In His Mind. </I>
 <I>In Doing So,</I>
 <I>Something Became</I>
 <I>Very Clear</I>
 <I>About The Nature</I>
 <I>Of His Relationship</I>
 <I>With Mr. Henry Harrison,</I>
 <I>Who--</I>
- I'm Back.
- Oh.
Did You Pee Already?
- Yes.
- Where?
Out There.
Out In The Street?
- Yes.
- No, You Didn't.
Yes, I Did, Louis.
A True Aristocrat Knows
That He Can Piss In The Street
At Any Time He Wishes
Day Or Night.
 <I>Next.</I>
Henry, I Want To See
Where You Peed.
Don't Be Ridiculous.
Right There,
Between The Cars.
How Did You Do It
Without Being Seen?
You Could Have
Been Arrested.
It's An Acquired Art.
Look, I'll Show You.
Now Watch,
And Do As I Do.
Ready?
Step Off The Curb
As If You're Going
To Walk Across The Street.
Then You Stop Abruptly,
Thinking Twice
About Crossing In Traffic.
Meanwhile,
You've Undone
Your Zipper,
You've Freed Yourself
And Then,
Keeping A Wide Arc
With The Raincoat,
You Step Backwards,
You See?
This Way, No One Can
See You're Pissing,
And The Walking
Backwards Part
Keeps You From Pissing
On Your Legs,
Not To Mention
Stepping In It.
Oh, I Just Did
A Bit More.
So Now Do You
Understand?
I Think
I Actually Do. Yeah.
Thank You
For Teaching Me That.
You're Welcome.
And Keep The Change.
 <I>Don't Mention It.</I>
- Good Evening.
- Henry Harrison
For Mrs. Hueber.
Of Course.
Wow.
Whatever You Do,
Don't Mention
The Fleas To Lois.
If She Catches Them,
She'll Know They're From Me.
Then I'll Never
Get That Room.
 <I>Ma'am,</I>
 <I>Mr. Harrison.</I>
Wait. Wait.
Lois Has A Dog.
If I Can Transfer
My Fleas To Her Dog,
- We'll Be Saved.
- <I>( ELEVATOR BELL RINGS )</I>

 <I>Going Up?</I>
- ( BARKING )
- <I>Lovie!</I>
Oh, What A Good Girl.
Oh, I've Missed You!
Look At You
With Your Little--
What The Hell
Is That On You?
Looks Like
An Elizabethan Collar.
Henry, Put The Dog Down
And Bring Me Those
Roasted Chickens.
Right Away.
Right Away.
- Put It Down, Henry!
- ( BARKS )
I'm Coming.
Oh.
Hello, Meredith.
Um...
Wow.
What An Amazing View.
You Can See Everything
From Here.
I Know. I Grew Up
In This Neighborhood.
Did You Really?
We Were The Most
Popular Family.
 <I>Well, We Were Always</I>
 <I>Doing The Funnest Things.</I>
We Never Had
A Dull Moment.
 <I>I Thought All Families</I>
 <I>Were Like That.</I>
I Thought Life
Would Be Like That.
- Here We Are.
- I Don't Like The Dark Meat
Touching The Light.
Of Course Not.
 <I>Did I Mention, Lois,</I>
That I'll Be Having
A Staged Reading
Of My George Eliot Play
This Winter In Palm Beach?
Vivian Cudlip Has Secured
A Ballroom For Me In The Colony.
Really, Henry?
You're Planning To Be
In Palm Beach This Winter?
Well, Of Course.
And I Was Thinking
That You Would Be Perfect
For The George Eliot Role.
What Do You Say?
If You're Angling To Stay
In My Guest Room, Henry,
I Can't Have You
This Season.
I've Invited Meredith.
I Think The Sun'll
Be Very Good For Her
Bad Knee, Don't You?
- Lagerfeld?
- That's Correct.
Meredith.
( BANGING PLATE )
This Roasted Chicken
Is Delicious.
Henry, I Was Wondering
If You're Free Tomorrow.
I Found An Inexpensive
Sports Doctor
For My Knee 
In Brooklyn.
( LAUGHING )
I Was Wondering
If You Might Drive Me
To My Appointment?
Find Someone Else.
I'm Teaching Tomorrow.
I Don't Think
I Can Make It To
The Whitney Later Either.
Every Exhibit Is The Same--
Toilet Seats
And Sex Organs.
I'm No Longer In The Mood
For That Sort Of Thing.
Louis, We're Leaving.
Now!
I'm Sorry Things
Didn't Work Out Tonight.
Right.
( SIGHS HEAVILY )
Thank You For Taking Me.
I Had A Very Nice Time
At The Gallery.
The Whole Damned Evening
Was Engineered
By Lagerfeld
To Get Me To Drive Her
And Her Fat Knees
To Brooklyn.
Of Course She's Not Going
To Ask Lois.
She Wouldn't Do Anything
To Jeopardize That Room,
Now That She's Got Her Grubby
Little Paws On It.
Don't Dwell On It, Henry.
Lets Try To Focus
 <I>On Something Positive</I>
 <I>Like You Tell Me.</I>
Yes. Yes.
Yes, I Suppose
You're Right.
Yes.
That Roasted Chicken
Was Good.
I'll Try To Focus
On That.
 <I>( ENGINE SQUEAKING,</I>
 <I>CREAKING )</I>
Now What In God's Name
Is Happening?
Let's Look Under
The Hood! Out!
No No No No No
No No No.
Not My Car!
No No.
Not My Electra.
If I Lose That,
I Lose Everything.
Let's Just Leave
It Here Tonight.
We'll Come Back
In The Morning,
Get It Towed
And Repaired.
Really?
With What Money?
We'll Figure
Something Out.
Let's Just
Get A Taxi Home.
No.
No, You Go.
I Can't Now.
I Need To Walk
This Whole Evening Off.
Oh, Come On, Henry.
You Shouldn't Do
Such A Long Walk Alone.
What Do I Look Like?!
A Feeble Old Man?
You've Been In Manhattan
For 10 Minutes,
You're Going To Tell Me
What To Do?
I Told You I Want
To Walk Home Alone.
- I Was Just--
- I--
Just Go!
I Don't Need You.
 <I>( CLASSICAL</I>

No Dancing Today,
Huh, Henry?
Hmm.
 <I>( FOOTSTEPS</I>

Louis?
I'm Sorry, Were You
Reading Something?
I Didn't Mean
To Interrupt You.
No. No.
No, I Was Just--
No, I Wasn't
Reading Anything.
I Realize We Never Went Out
And Had That Lunch.
Are You By Chance
Available Today?
 <I>Did I Mention A Few</I>
 <I>Of Us From Work</I>
Are Going To See "I Am Cuba"
At The Cinema Village Tonight?
You Should Come.
Really?
That Would Be Wonderful.
Thank You.
I Find You Funny, Louis.
In What Way?
I Mean,
You're Interesting.
Sometimes You Remind Me
Of A Guy From Another
Time Period--
Like The '20S.
It's Funny
You Should Say That.
I Love That Era--
The Literature
From That Era.
I Never Told Anyone This,
But Sometimes,
In My Head,
I Actually Imagine
There's Somebody
Narrating My Life,
( WHISPERING )
As If I'm The Protagonist
In A Classic Novel.
Okay.
Narrator:
 <I>The Young Gentleman</I>
 <I>Immediately Regretted</I>
 <I>This Confession.</I>
 <I>He Struggled To Quickly</I>
 <I>Change The Subject.</I>
So I Never Asked You,
How Did The Whole
Upstate Thing Go?
Amazing.
You Should Come
To The Next One.
And Bring Someone Of Course.
Do You Live Alone?
No, I Have A Roommate,
But He's Much Older.
Old, Actually.
I Just Rent A Room
In His Apartment.
To Be Honest,
It's Not Going So Well.
He Gets Irrationally
Mad At Me.
Maybe He's
In Love With You.
No.
No.
I Would Never Want
To Think Of Him Like That.
There Was One Time
It Crossed My Mind But--
Why? What Did He Do
That Made You Wonder?
Well,
It's Kind Of Strange,
But We Were
Drinking Wine
And I Was Lying
On The Floor
Trying To Work Up
The Energy To Go To Bed,
And Something
Very Odd Happened.
That's It?
( LAUGHS )
I Guess It Was Nothing.
I Don't Know Why
I Just Told You That.
I'm Sorry.
Louis, There's Something
I Wanted To Ask You.
Sure.
Well, You Know That Guy
I Started Seeing?
He's Going To Jamaica
On Thursday,
And He Invited Me
To Come With Him.
I Really
Really Wanna Go.
I've Never Been Out
Of The Country Before,
And I'm So
Into Bob Marley.
But George Is Giving Me
A Hard Time At Work
With All The Photo
Clearances Piling Up,
So I Convinced Him
That You Could Cover For Me
While I Was Away.
It's Just
For A Couple Days.
Sure.
Whatever You Need.
You Are The Best.
I Owe You A Major Favor!
( SHRIEKS )

Henry:
 <I>Ow Ow Ow.</I>
 <I>Ow Ow Ow.</I>
Ow. Oh, Hello!
- How Are You?
- I'm All Right.
You Certainly
Seem Better. 
Yes, My Funk
Has Lifted,
Although I Couldn't
Tell You Why.
I Got A Call
From The Gas Station.
They Said Just To Get
My Car To Run
 <I>Will Cost</I>
 <I>A Small Fortune.</I>
I Did, However, Hear
About A Very Promising
Room In Palm Beach.
- Good For You.
- <I>Which Reminds Me--</I>
I Have A Proposal
Which Might
Save You Money.
What If You Were
To Let Me Borrow Your Car
To Keep With Me
In Florida,
Just For Two Months- 
In Exchange For
My Paying
Your Auto Insurance
 <I>During That Time.</I>
So That's Your Motivation
For Speaking To Me Again?
Well--
Partially, Yes.
It's An Idea I Thought
Would Benefit Us Both.
Why Don't You Follow
Through On Your Offer
To Introduce Me
To Vivian Cudlip's Niece?
That Would Be Of
A Lot More Use To Me
Right Now
Than Insurance Money.
No, I Can't.
It Wouldn't Be Right.
Why?
Is Something
So Wrong With Me?
( SIGHS )
Uh, It's--
I Can't Lend You My Car.
It Has Special Meaning.
My Father Left It To Me.
 <I>I Didn't Mean</I>
 <I>To Upset You.</I>

Under The Carpet.
- <I>Hmm?</I>

Louis?
What Are You Doing Here?
I'm Sorry I Couldn't
Make The Movie.
But I Was
In The Neighborhood,
And Thought You Might
Need A Ride Home.
Oh. Well,
I'm Pretty Religious
About Public Transportation.
You Don't Actually Drive
This Thing Around The City,
Do You?
No No.
Of Course Not.
I Was Helping Out
My Friend Lagerfeld.
She's Quite Enormous,
And Has Trouble Getting Around.
Oh.
That's Really
Nice Of You.
Well, Since You're
Already Out And About.
Buckle Up.
Now I Owe You Two Favors.
I'm Not Sure I Can
Handle All This.
No, You Don't
Owe Me Anything.
Oh, Go Straight.
Go Straight.
This Is Brad's Block.
I'm Staying There Tonight.
Oh.

- Mary: <I>Oh My God.</I>
- I'm Sorry.
I Seriously Just Had

I'm Just Having
The Worst Day Ever, Mary.
Let's Go See
What That Was.
- Shit.
- Go Go Go.
Oh, God.
Did I Kill It?
Somebody's Idea

 <I>He Is Kind</I>
 <I>Of Cute, Though.</I>
- ( LAUGHS ) He Is.
- You Know What, Louis?
I Think I'm Just...
Going To Walk The Rest
Of The Way From Here.
- Oh, Sure.
- <I>Bye, You Two!</I>
Okay Okay Okay.
( GROANING )
Oh God.
Henry:
 <I>We'll Speak</I>
 <I>In The Morning, Gershon.</I>
Get Some Rest.
You're Looking More
Haggard Than Usual.
Oh God!
You Should Really Stop
Lurking About In The Shadows,
 <I>It's Becoming A Serious</I>
 <I>Character Flaw.</I>
I Just Got In.
Excuse Me.
What A Disastrous Evening.
My God, Gershon Served
Boiled Tongue For Dinner.
 <I>And Then Later We Taxied Over</I>
 <I>To Take A Look At My Car,</I>
And Gershon Confirmed That
It's Completely Beyond Repair.
However, I Did Remember
That The Last Time
I Was Out At Vivian's Place
In Southampton
I Happened To Notice
A Beautiful Vehicle For Sale
 <I>Out By The Bay,</I>
 <I>Where The Riff Raff Stay.</I>
Gershon And I Were Thinking
Of Going Up This Weekend--
Have A Look,
See If It's Still There.
Want To Come Along?
I Take It You're
Just Looking For A Ride?
Yes,
But Why Focus On It
That Way?
Think Of Yourself!
It's Supposed
To Be An Unseasonably
Beautiful Weekend,
Courtesy
Of Global Warming.
And I Think You'd Enjoy
Meeting Gershon.
He's-- Well, Different.
( HONKING )
Where's Gershon?
Gershon Is
Pathologically Late.
Why Don't You Go In
And Urge Him On?
I Don't Even Know Him.
You Really Should See
His Apartment.
It's Quite Interesting.
Okay.
I'll Just Take It
For A Little Spin.
Joking.
 <I>Oh, Look.</I>
( SPEAKING French )
 <I>Decapotable.</I>
( LAUGHS )
Gershon?
Gershon?
( KNOCKS )
Gershon?
 <I>Hello?</I>
Oh! Hello, I'm Louis--
Henry's Roommate.
We Were Waiting
In The Car
And Henry Wanted Me To--
( HIGH VOICE )
Please Accept My Apologies.
I Was Just Putting
My Shoes On.
No, Of Course.
Wow, Look At This.
You Have So Many
Interesting Things.
( HIGH VOICE CONTINUING )
Yes, I Collect Souvenirs.
Must Have Been Everywhere.
No.
I Actually Have
Never Been Anywhere.
Too Busy Working.
What Kind Of Work
Do You Do, Gershon?
I'm A Subway Mechanic.
- Sorry.
- Anyway...
I Do Love My Job.,
But It's Always
Been My Dream
To Buy A Sailboat
And Sail Off
With A Beautiful Woman
To The Mediterranean.
We'd Travel Straight
To The Blue Grotto,
Where Tiny Rowboats Wait.
Then We'd Paddle Out
Into The Warm Wet Cave,
And Kiss And Sing
And Harmonize
With Our Own Echoes.
I Still Believe
It's Possible.
The Boat And The Woman.
 <I>( Henry SINGING</I>
 <I>IN French )</I>
What's That Song?
That's A Good One.
From An Operetta I Saw
When I Was Living In Paris--
 <I>"Pas Sur La Bouche."</I>
"Not On The Mouth."
It's About A Man
Who Doesn't Like
To Be Kissed
On The Mouth.
That's The Whole Plot.
- No, That's Insane!
- <I>Why? I Happen To Agree.</I>
Rubbing Noses Is
Far More Sanitary.
How Did You Afford
To Live Abroad, Henry?
I Had An Inheritance.
 <I>Both My Parents Were Dead</I>
 <I>By The Time I Was 22.</I>
So I Moved To Europe
For 10 Years,
Spent Every Last Cent.
Did Both Your Parents
Die At The Same Time?
My Father Died 
When I Was Two.
Actually I Was Raised
By My Bohemian Aunt. 
Why Not Your Mother?
My Mother Was Afraid Of Me.
My Aunt Understood Me.
She Taught Literature
At Johns Hopkins.
She Was Always
Taking Ships To Europe
And Having Love Affairs.
Quite Beautiful,
But She Never Married.
 <I>Fascinating Woman.</I>
Sounds Like You
Really Loved Her.
This Is Starting To Sound
Like An Interview.
Are You Planning To Write
The Unauthorized Biography
Of An Obscure Playwright
Whose Masterpiece Was Stolen
By A Hunchback?
Is It So Wrong
To Be Interested In You?
Yes!
I'm Not Interested In You.
From Now On
I Intend To Give You
The Most Misleading
Image Possible.
You May Write
My Biography,
But You Will Never
Capture My Soul.
Henry:
Thank God
We've Finally Landed.
Between Manhattan
And The East End,
There's Nothing
But Cemeteries And Strip Clubs.
Did You Know
That Topless Bars
Do Their Best Business
On Mother's Day?
 <I>It's The Udders.</I>
That's The Day Men
Most Need To See Them.
That Actually Makes
Lots Of Sense.
This Certainly
Is A Beautiful Inlet.
 <I>Maybe It's A Cove.</I>
I Believe The Appropriate Word
Is Actually "Bight."
 <I>B-I-G-H-T,</I>
A Noun Meaning
"A Wide Bay Formed
By Curved Land."
 <I>There's All Kinds</I>
 <I>Of Wonderful Words</I>
 <I>In The Bs Actually.</I>
My Personal Favorite
Is "Bisextile,"
 <I>Which Means Nothing</I>
 <I>Like It Sounds.</I>
Believe It Or Not
It Means,
"Of Or Pertaining
To Leap Year."
So Next February 29th,
We Should All Remember
To Wish Each Other
A Happy Bisextile Day!
( LAUGHING )
Thank God
It's Still Here.
Look At Her.
Oh, Yes.
- A Thing Of Beauty.
- The 1975 Cadillac
V-8 El Dorado.
- Henry: <I>Excellent.</I>
- 400 Horsepower,
- 500 Pound-Feet Of Torque...
- Mm-Hmm.
...And Single Digit
Gas Mileage.
That's Terrible
For The Environment.
Oh, And I Suppose
Yours Is Better?
It Seems The Owners Have
Left For The Season.
 <I>We Should Call And Arrange</I>
 <I>A Test Drive, Henry.</I>
We've Come All This Way,
We Might As Well Have
A Peek Under The Hood.
Climb In There
And Try And Open Her Up.
It's Open.
New Tires.
That's Good.
Okay.
Henry, I Can't--
 <I>Let Gershon Do It.</I>
 <I>He's The Mechanically</I>
 <I>Inclined One.</I>
I Don't See One.
Maybe This Is
A Secret Hood Release.
- Oh, No!
- No!
Scheisse.
 <I>Better Vamoose Before</I>
 <I>The</I> Polizei <I>Arrive.</I>
- Louis: <I>Henry.</I>
- Woman: <I>Who's That?</I>
Henry:
At Least I Have
A Piece Of A New Car.
Tomorrow I'll Call
And Inquire
As To The Price
Of The Rest Of It.
Louis:
Henry, You Can't.
That's Like Returning
To The Scene Of A Crime.
Are You Insane?
They'd Never Suspect Me.
Who'd Be Stupid Enough
To Deface A Car And Then
Inquire About Its Price?
You Know, Gershon,
This Young Man
Is Very Well Read,
But He Knows Nothing
About Real Life.
Yes, I'm Starting
To Think That.
Yes, He's Such A Sad,
Old Soul Too.
You Know That He's Never
Even Learned How To Dance?
That's More Than Sad.
That's Tragic.
Well, If Henry Would Let Me
Watch Him Once In A While,
I Might Pick Up
A Step Or Two.
My Steps Cannot
Be Learned.
They're Entirely Intuitive,
Based On Jungle Rhythms.
Try Me.
( CHUCKLES )
Very Well.
Gershon, You've Got
A Beautiful Singing Voice.
We Hear You In The Shower
All The Time, Going On And On.
Why Don't You Sing Us
Something That's Danceable?
What Genre Do You Prefer?
Um...
I Don't Know.
Let's Start
With A Waltz.
- ( CLEARS THROAT )
- Yeah.
Over Here.
We Need Space.
- Now Observe And Imitate.
- ( DEEP VOICE )
* Somewhere My Love... 
- Oh, Yes.
- * There Will Be
Songs To Sing... *
So Once He's Singing,
He Has A Human Voice.
Now Shoulders So.
Chest Out.
Aristocratic.
Watch Closely.
Do As I Do.
- One, Two, Three,
 One, Two, Three.
- <I>* Somewhere A Hill... </I>
- That's Right. Yes. Float!
- <I>* Blossoms In Green</I>
 <I> And Gold *</I>
- * And There Are Dreams... 
- <I>Don't Bend Your Knees</I>
 <I> Too Much.</I>
It's Not A Peasant Dance.
You're An Aristocrat!
You're Above The World.
- * Someday... 
- You're Floating.
- <I>* We'll Meet Again... *</I>
- One And Turn, And Turn.
- <I>* My Love... </I>
- Whirl-- The Dervishes!
- It's Transcendent.
- * Someday, Whenever
The Spring Breaks Through. *
That's It. Yes!
Ohh! Oh, Oh!
- Henry! Henry, Are You Okay?
- ( Henry GROANING, SHOUTING )
- Are You Okay?
- My Sciatica!
What Do We Do?!
What Do You Do?
Get Me Off This
Godforsaken Beach.
I Need Alcohol
And Civilization.
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, God.
( GROANING )
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- How Do We Do This?
( GROANING )
Don't Forget My Hat!
Vivian Cudlip Bought
That For Me In Moscow!
( HIGH VOICE )
Put Him On The Floor.
I Know How To Fix Him.
I Did It Two Years Ago.
No, You Didn't.
You Made It Worse.
 <I>Don't Be Difficult,</I>
 <I>Henry.</I>
I'm The One Who Got You
Walking Again And You Know It.
It's A Conspiracy,
Isn't It?
Otto Bellman Hired You,
Didn't He?
- To Assassinate Me.
- <I>Kneel Down.</I>
Tell Him He Can Keep
My Damn Play!
- <I>On Your Stomach.</I>
 <I> All Right.</I>
- ( GROANING )
Shh. Now...
I'm Going To Begin
By Applying Sharp Pressure...
( SPITS )
To The Areas Just Above
Both Buttocks.
What?
Not With Your Hands
You're Not!
I Don't Want Your Germs.
Use Some Other Technique.
Fine.
Here, I'll Use This.
Oh, I Don't Know About That,
Gershon. It Doesn't Look--
- I'll Make It Work.
- What? What Are You--
- Hold Still.
- ( SCREAMING )
Are You Insane?!
God!
You're Trying To Kill Me!
How In God's Name Is
That Supposed To Help?!
- Hey, Here's Some Brandy.
- I Know.
I Need To Go Get
My Acupressure Book.
And I Have A Very Large
Vibrator Downstairs.
- Mmm.
- I'll Be Right Back.
Oh, God.
Louis, I Think I See My--
My Eye Mask.
It's My Eye Mask,
Isn't It?
Oh My... God.
Ohh!
Mmm! Oh.
Let Me Get You A Pillow.
Louis. Louis.
For God's Sake,
Do Not--
Do Not Let...
Gershon In With His Vibrator.
You Can Imagine Where
That Thing's Been.
All I Need Is Sleep.
I Need To Put On
My Eye Mask.
Don't Worry.
I'll Handle Gershon.
If, By Chance,
I Die In My Sleep,
I Want You To Make Sure
That The Funeral Mass
Is In <I>Latin.</I>
And Give All My Worldly Goods
To Catholic Charities,
Except For The Christmas Balls.
Those Go To You.
You're Not Going To Die.
Just Get Some Sleep, Okay?
Yes, Sleep.
You Know, Louis,
In Spite
Of Your Quirks,
 <I>I Think You're</I>
 <I>The Sanest Person I Know.</I>
I'm Very Lucky
To Have You Here.
- <I>( DOOR BANGS )</I>
- Gershon: <I>I've Got</I>
 <I> The Vibrator!</I>
( SCREAMS )
 <I>( PHONE RINGING )</I>
( GROANS )
I Got It.
I Got It.
H. Harrison's Residence.
Oh. Yes.
Just One Minute,
Please.
It's Vivian Cudlip's
Secretary.
H. Harrison.
 <I>I'm Sorry?</I>
Oh. Oh, Vivian,
How Are You, Dear?
Yes. Oh,
That Sounds Lovely.
Yes, I Look Forward To It.
Oh, God, God, God, God.
Is Something Wrong?
Vivian's Hosting
A Dinner Party Tonight
At The Russian Tea Room.
She Wants Me
To Escort Her.
And Look At Me, Lying Here
Like A Useless Old Man.
Maybe You Should
Just Call Her Back
 <I>And Tell Her</I>
 <I>The Truth.</I>
I'm Sure
She'd Understand.
At Her Age She Must
Have Health Problems.
Vivian Has Had Every Cancer
There Is-- Twice.
Not To Mention A Hole
In Her Heart.
But That Hasn't Stopped Her
Ever From Going Out.
If I Let Vivian Contact
Any Of The Other Rosen Knights,
 <I>I'll Be Banished.</I>
But, Henry,
There's No Way You Can Go.
No.
No.
But You Can.
Me?
 <I>( DOORBELL RINGS )</I>
Hello. I'm Here
For Mrs. Cudlip.
Woman:
 <I>Come In.</I>
Wait Here.
( WHISPERING )
Come In.
 <I>You're Louis.</I>
Henry's Young Friend.
 <I>Yes.</I>
It's A Pleasure
To Meet You, Mrs. Cudlip.
I've Heard Nothing
But Wonderful Things.
Well, If Henry Said Them,
Don't Believe A Word.
Lately That Man Is
Not To Be Trusted.
He Introduced
My Granddaughter
To A Deformed
Swiss Con Man,
And I'm Not Happy
About It.
- That's Shocking.
- He Can Be A Dear
Friend, Henry,
But He's Annoyingly Intent
At Being Something More.
He's Always Dropping Hints
About Marrying Me, You Know.
No, I Didn't.
And My Other Friend, Aresh,
Is The Same Way.
( CHUCKLING )
You'll Meet Him At Dinner.
- This Rose Is For You.
- Very Thoughtful.
The Car's Waiting.
- May I Help You?
- Let's Go.
Get This For You.
So What Do You Think
Of The Russian Tea Room, Louis?
This Caviar Is Wonderful.
The Champagne As Well.
Yes. I Want More.
Right Away, Mrs. Cudlip.
Anything You Need, Just Ask.
( SPEAKING Arabic )
A Toast To Vivian.
- Oh, Yes.
- The Most Beautiful,
The Most Sophisticated,
The Most Cultured...
- Waiter, I Need A Straw.
- <I>...The Most Prominent...</I>
- Of Course.
- ...And The Most Popular
Grand Dame
In All Of New York!
( SUCKING )
Also, You Have Received
A Phone Message, Mrs. Cudlip.
Oh, Thank You.
It's Nice To See
You Again, Meredith.
Oh.
Oh, That's Right. Yes.
Yes, Hello.
I'm Sorry We Couldn't
Accompany You And Lois
To The Whitney
That Night.
Henry Was A Bit
Out Of Sorts.
You Mean Rude.
But You Know,
I Don't Care.
Henry Is Horrible
To All Women.
Oh, I Don't Think
That's True.
He Had His Heart
Broken Years Ago
When He Was Young
And Handsome
And Still Had Money,
And He Takes It Out
On Women Ever Since.
 <I>You Know, He Was In Love</I>
 <I>With A Catholic Girl.</I>
Her Family Wouldn't
Accept Him.
 <I>Henry's Protestant,</I>
And He Pretends
Ever Since To Be Catholic
Because He Thinks It Has Some
Sort Of Moral Snob Appeal.
Spencer Mooney
Told Me He Suspects
That Henry
Is Homosexual.
People Say That Too.
 <I>And He Was</I>
 <I>In The Theater.</I>
Theater Types Need To Be
A Little Homosexual
So They Can Feel Things
More Deeply.
But Henry Is The Opposite--
He Has No Feelings.
- I Don't Think So.
- Oh, I Think So.
I Give Up.
Louis,
Could You Read This Name
Here For Me, Please?
Of Course.
"Barry Barbarash."
Oh, I'm Not Going
To Answer That.
If He Hears
I'm With Other Men,
He Just Gets
Wildly Jealous.
Yes, Vivian, I Wouldn't
Encourage Him.
He Is Charming
And Has Very Wonderful
Long Legs,
But He Spies On You,
Vivian, In Palm Beach.
Yes.
He Has Binoculars
And He Looks At You
When You Undress
In Your Room At The Colony.
Don't Get Started, Aresh.
- Just Look At Your Menu...
- Yes.
...And Pick Out
An Entree Please.
How About Barbarash's
Head On A Plate?
( CHUCKLING )
You See?
You're No Better
Than Any Of Them.
 <I>You're Just As Jealous.</I>
Wouldn't You Agree
With Me, Louis?
Well, Wanting Someone's
Head On A Plate
With Flaming Cognac
Does Sound A Little
Jealous To Me.
What "Flaming Cognac"?
( LAUGHING )
"Flaming Cognac"!
- ( ALL LAUGHING )
- Louis, I Like You.
I Like You So Much.
( SHOUTING Arabic )
( LAUGHS NERVOUSLY )
 <I>I Didn't Mean </I>
 <I>To Offend Him.</I>
Did I Really Hurt
His Feelings?
Oh Yes, I Think So.
Aresh Offends Easily.
I'm Terribly Sorry.
Please Excuse Me.
( SUCKING )
Henry's Protege.
Aresh.
She Doesn't Know
How Much She Hurt Me.
 <I>I've Lost My Country.</I>
 <I>Everything.</I>
She Could
So Easily Help Me,
But She Doesn't Even
Consider It.
I Am Through With Her.
I Am Through
With Vivian Cudlip.
Mary:
 <I>Louis?</I>
Oh My God,
It Is You!
Brad, This Is
The Guy From "Terra"
I Was Telling You About.
- <I>The One That</I>
 <I> Covered For Me.</I>
- Hey, Man.
- <I>Thanks A Million, Really.</I>
- Sure. Sure.
We Just Got Out
Of "The Women Of World Music"
Show At Carnegie Hall.
- <I>What Are You Doing Up Here?</I>
- Oh, You Know,
Just Having
Dinner With Some Friends.
Here?
- Yes.
- Oh My God,
That's Perfect.
Louis!
Don't You Dare
Let Aresh's Nonsense
Ruin Our Evening.
I Never Loved That Iranian
And I Never Will,
So Get Back In There.
I Have To Go.
I'll See You At The Office.
- Come In.
- Champagne.
Upstairs To The Left.
Okay.
I'll Carry You.
Good Night, Vivian.
Thank You
For A Spectacular Evening.
No,
Thank You, Dear Boy.
Tonight,
You Were Nothing Short
Of A Perfect Gentleman.
- <I>( DOOR CLOSES )</I>
- Ah, Here We Are.
Henry, You're Walking.
 <I>Yes, A Miracle.</I>
 <I>Gershon's Magic Vibrator</I>
 <I>Got Me Up And Running Again,</I>
At Least Temporarily.
How Was Your Evening?
It Was Wonderful.
Vivian And I Got Along
Beautifully.
You Weren't Supposed
To Do That Well.
I Sent You There
To Keep My Rivals At Bay,
Not To Become One Of Them.
Actually,
I Feel Sorry For Vivian.
Everybody Seems To Want
Something From Her,
And Yet She's
Still So Sweet.
Sweet? Vivian?
She's A Monster.
You Should See The Way
She Treats Her Staff.
It's Like Something
Out Of "Peter The Great."
Oh.
Well, Maybe She's
A Sweet Monster.
Why Are You Packing?
- I'm Going To Florida.
- Huh? 
Yes.
Sun, Vermouth
And Codeine Is
My Only Hope For A Cure.
When Are You Leaving?
Tonight,
On The Midnight Bus.
( SIGHS )
So There We Are.
Where Are We?
I'm Going
To Miss You, Henry.
Don't Be Ridiculous.
But I Am.
 <I>Can I At Least Help You</I>
 <I>With Your Bag?</I>
They Make Them
With Wheels Now.
I'll Manage.
So Try Not To Burn Down
The Apartment,
 <I>And No Guests.</I>
You Know The Rules.
I'll See You In The Spring!

I'm Otto Bellman.
I Lived Here Once
With Henry.
He's In Palm Beach, Yes?
Oh. Yes, He Is.
I Would Like My Mail.
Okay.
Please, Come In.
And Excuse My Appearance.
I Don't Forget
This Place.
It Is Most Filthy Home
I Ever Lived In.
Why Is It So Cold?
Henry Kept It
In The Freezer.
( LAUGHS )
Oh, Henry.
( LAUGHING )
 <I>Henry Is Very Original,</I>
 <I>Don't You Think?</I>
Christmas Balls,
Very Original.
Dancing, Very Original.
Sneaking Into The Opera,
Very Original.
He And I Went
Six Times Together.
That Many?
What Is Your Name?
Oh, I'm Sorry. Louis.
Louis?
- Ah, Louis Ives.
- Yes.
You Are On Vivian's List
To Attend My Wedding.
I Will Marry
Her Granddaughter, You Know.
I've Heard.
Congratulations.
I'm Flattered To Hear
I Made Vivian's List.
I Would Like Henry
To Attend.
 <I>He Is Still Mad</I>
 <I>At Me Though.</I>
He Accuses Me
Of Stealing His Play.
Anyway,
I Will Track Him Down
Myself In Palm Beach 
And Convince Him.
So The Wedding
Will Be Soon?
Yes.
Thank You For Mail.
I Go See Gershon Now.
Mary:
 <I>Brad Is Always Complaining</I>
About The Ratty T-Shirts
I Sleep In.
Oh No.
- <I>Oh My God.</I>
- The Sales Girl Said
It Would Look Great.
Oh Yeah!
- <I>Yeah.</I>
- He's Gonna--
Shit, Louis!
- How Embarrassing.
- Don't Worry.
I Have The Same One.
( LAUGHING )
Mary, Could I Talk
To You For A Second
- Before You Leave?
- Sure.
I'll Wait For You
In The Hallway.
So Remember At Lunch
How You Said You Owe Me
A Big Favor?
- Mm-Hmm.
- Well,
As It Turns Out
I Have Been Invited
To A Society Wedding.
I'd Like
To Bring A Date,
But I Don't Really Know
Anyone My Age In Town,
So I Was Wondering
If Maybe You'd
Accompany Me.
Um...
I'm Pretty Serious
With Brad Right Now,
- So This Is--
- I Didn't Mean It That Way.
I Understand You're
In A Relationship.
 <I>I Just Thought Maybe</I>
 <I>We Could Go</I>
 <I>As Friends.</I>
In Fact, I'm Supposed
To Get Introduced
To A Young Woman There.
The Niece Of The Bride's
Grandmother.
I Really Just--
I Don't Think This Is
The Best Idea.
Please Don't Be Mad.
I Just Think That Honesty
Is Super Important,
And The Truth Is...
It Makes Me
Uncomfortable.
Okay.
I Understand.
Have A Great Weekend.
 <I>I'll See You Monday.</I>
 <I>( DANCE MUSIC PLAYING )</I>
I Adore You.
 <I>Hey, Baby.</I>
Can I Get You
Anything Else, Honey?
No, Thank You.
I'm Fine.
Okay.
Is This Your
First Time Here?
Yes, Actually It Is.
I'm Miss Pepper,
And If You're Interested
In Dating A Woman
Like Me, You Can.
Many Of The Beautiful Girls
Here Are Available
For A Date.
For A Donation, That Is.
I Don't Think So,
But They Are
Beautiful.
I Don't Understand
How You Do It.
Oh.
You Know,
You'd Actually Make
A Pretty Girl Yourself.
Put On A Fierce Blond Wig
To Go With Your Bright Eyes.
 <I>Contour Your Nose A Bit.</I>
My Nose Is Very Masculine,
Isn't It?
Honey, If There's
A Woman In There,
It Would Take More
Than A Nose To Keep Her Down.
George?
Yes.
You Must Be Sandra.
Please Come In.
Where Do You
Want To Do This?
I Usually Suggest
The Kitchen.
Okay. Sure.
Great. Strip Down
To Your Underwear
And We'll Get Started.
This Is What
I'd Like To Wear.
Sure, If It Fits.
You Given Any Thought
To The Wig?
I Brought Three.
Yes. I'd Like
Brunette, Please.
In Fact,
I Would Like To Look...
As Much As Possible
Like Her.
* A Plume Of Doom
Will Rise *
* Eluding Hearts
And Skies *
* Destroying Eagles' Eyes *
* While We All Lament 
* This Business
Of Cement. *
 <I>What Was That?</I>
I Thought Maybe I Would
Contribute A Song
To The Next Rally.
 <I>I Think It Kind </I>
 <I>Of Works, Maybe.</I>
- ( HISSES )
- What?
It's A Little
Corny, No?
Oh.
- It's Not Finished Yet.
- ( CHUCKLES )
That's Not Very Nice.
 <I>Okay. I'm Sorry.</I>
 <I>I Just--</I>
I Just Believe
That Honesty
Is Super Important.
You Know What?
Come On.
 <I>Let's Go To Bed.</I>

Henry, I'm Sorry.
I'm So Sorry.
I Don't Want
Your Sympathy.
- I Only Want Your Absence.
- <I>Henry, Please.</I>
I'm Going For A Walk.
I Want You
Out Of My Apartment
By The Time I Get Back.
Please Wait.
Can't You Just
For Once--
Henry!
Henry, I Don't Know
What To Say!
Look, Obviously
I Have Some Issues!
Mmm.
I Tried My Best
To Hide Them,
Because I Desperately
Wanted Your Friendship.

 <I>I Don't Even</I>

I Need To Talk To You About.
Okay.
Louis, Phone Sales,
They're Not Really
Right For You.
- No?
- No.
You're Just--
You're Not The Right
Personality Type, Louis.
Now Our Magazine
Is Doing--
Is Doing Very Well,
You Know That.
The Editing Staff
Can Barely Keep Up
With All The Unsolicited
Manuscripts That Are
Coming In.
So What I Would
Prefer To Do
Is To Start You
Copy Editing.
You've Got A Quiet,
Keen Insight, Louis.
That's An Asset Here.
We Should Groom You
As A Writer,
 <I>Not As A Salesman.</I>
I Guess What
I'm Saying Is,
I'm Offering You
A Promotion.
Mary:
 <I>Louis?</I>
Louis, I Need
To Talk To You.
I Was Thinking...
And You Did Me
A Really Selfless Favor,
And I Was Really Selfish
Not To Return It.
Oh.
So If You Still Need
A Date For That Wedding,
I Would Be Happy
And Honored
To Fill That Position.
Mary,
I Really Appreciate
You Offering
To Be My Date.
But I'm Not Sure
If It's The Best Thing
For Me Anymore.
Really?
Are You Throwing Those
Christmas Balls Out?
 <I>Hello, Henry.</I>
Look At Them,
Strutting Around As If
They Own The Whole City...
And Yet They're
Completely Dependent.
Not A Pot To Piss In.
Well, They Do Look
Awfully Proud.
Henry, I Want To Apologize
For Last Night.
You Are Always Apologizing.
Don't Be So Obsequious.
It's Your Apartment.
They're Your Rules.
I Broke Them.
Yes...
All That Is True.
 <I>But I'm Not</I>
 <I>As Old Fashioned</I>
 <I>As You Think.</I>
Does That Mean You're
Not Kicking Me Out For Good?
Don't Be Ridiculous.
You Did Kick Bellman
Out For Less.
I Know.
But There's
A Difference--
It Would Be Sad
To Lose You.
Hmm.
But You Really Do
Need Help, You Know?
You Might Think
About Going Over
To The American Legion
For Counseling.
Hmm.
No, They'll Get
You Thinking Right.
Actually, What I've
Decided To Do Is
To Devote More Time
To Writing--
Professionally
And Personally.
I Think It May Be
Therapeutic.
Good.
Yes, It Helps.
But I Wouldn't Rule Out
Psychoanalysis Either.
 <I>I've Thought</I>
 <I>About That Too.</I>
- Gershon?!
- ( LAUGHS ) Hey!
You Look Great,
Gershon.
- Thank You.
- You Look Practically
Middle Class.
- I Did It
For The Wedding.
- My God.
What's This?
My Play!
Gershon, You?
I Was Angry.
And I Was Hurt.
And I Wanted
To Hurt You Back.
But I'm Sorry, Henry.
It Was Wrong.
I Deeply Regret It.
Can You Find It In Your Heart
To Forgive Me?
I Forgive You, Gershon.
You Mustn't Sin Anymore.
No Sin Against
Your Fellow Man,
No Sin Against Your Body.
Follow The Bible.
Work!
Work On Your Soul.
Pray For Enlightenment.
Who Knows, Maybe Louis And I
Will Get Some Too,
Because We Live
Just Upstairs. 
And Do You,
Otto Ralph Bellman,
Take This Woman,
Margaret Chase Cudlip,
To Be Your Lawfully
Wedded Wife,
For Richer, For Poorer,
 <I>In Sickness</I>
 <I>And In Health,</I>
 <I>So Long As You Both</I>
 <I>Shall Live?</I>
That's Vivian's Niece.
- Otto: <I>I Do.</I>
- <I>By The Power Vested In Me</I>
 <I>By The Almighty God...</I>
She's A Little Old For Me,
Don't You Think?
- <I>I Now Pronounce</I>
 <I> You Man And Wife.</I>
- Hmm?
- She's Barely 50.
- Henry, Shh!
- Shh!
- Shh!
- Shh!
- Shh!
- <I>You May Now Kiss</I>
 <I> The Bride.</I>
- Sacred.
 <I>( APPLAUSE )</I>
Congratulations.
Congratulations, Otto.
Henry:
I've Been Thinking.
When I Finish Teaching
In August,
The Three Of Us
Should Go To Russia.
Three Can Manage
Very Well There.
We Won't Need Much.
A Bottle Of Champagne
Only Costs
 <I>$4 On The Black Sea.</I>
Oh, Thank You,
My Dear.
Lovely.
 <I>( APPLAUSE )</I>
