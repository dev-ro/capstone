Finbar, come on.
Mom, don't call me
Finbar, all right?
Finbar,
I'm telling you
Because you're the only
one who'll understand.
You'll have to tell
your brothers.
Understand what?
I'm leaving.
What do you mean?
Your father's
dead and buried.
I gave him the best
years of my life.
{Y:i}I have to live
the rest of my life.
What the hell
are you talking about?
Watch your mouth!
I'm going back
to Ireland.
For, for
Mr. O'Shaughnessy?
I love him, Finbar.
I've loved him
my whole life.
Does, does he even know
you're coming?
Of course he knows.
He's been waiting
35 years for this day.
Give your mom
a kiss.
I have a plane
to catch.
Are you sure
you'll be all right?
I'll be fine, darling.
Tell your brothers
I'll explain everything
When I call next week.
Promise me
you won't make
The same mistake
I made.
I promise.
Good boy.
Good luck, mom.
So, Barry,
let me ask you.
What's up with you
and Heather?
You got this new one
here now,
And you guys
are done?
Well, you know,
I mean...
Just like
any long relationship,
Long relationship?
You were with her
for six months.
Yeah, well,
that's a long time, you know.
I mean...You know,
the mystery was over, man.
I don't know why
that happens.
It's God's way
of testing you, Barry.
You're failing.
Yeah. He loves
to torture us.
So you believe
in God now?
This is your story.
Oh, yeah, yeah,
on his good days.
Then you're not
a catholic anymore.
No, I'm still a catholic,
I guess.
Kind of.
Catholic?
Who the hell
are you kidding?
You Haven't
been in church
Since 10th grade.
Yeah, but who can deal
With all that repression,
anyhow?
Hey, repression is not
such a bad thing, OK?
Especially
for a savage like you.
So...When did
all this happen?
{Y:i}I mean,
what did she do,
As I'm positive
it's her fault completely.
She started talking
about getting married.
Marriage?
Jesus. And what
did you say?
I asked her who
she was planning on marrying
And if she'd be
kind enough
To invite me
to the wedding.
You said that to her?
Good for her.
I'm glad she threw you out.
So...Where are you
going to live now,
Mr. Hotshot noncommittal?
I, uh...
I don't know, man.
Don't even think
about it.
Like I might ever live
with this joker.
No, I'm going to look
for a place
In the village
tomorrow, I think.
The village, huh?
That's about
your speed.
Yeah. O.K.
We better get in.
Molly's probably
got it ready for us.
I don't care
What anybody says.
It doesn't make
a difference
If he did
or he didn't.
All I can say is,
thank you
For giving us
John, Jr. Ha ha ha!
I saw him jogging
Through the park
yesterday.
Now, there is
a real man.
Sounds like
She really
loves you, pal.
Oh, yeah, totally.
I think Molly's right.
Thank you,
Patrick.
Wait.
What are you saying?
You don't like JFK now,
The only Irish-catholic
president
Of our great country?
Listen, I don't, 
I don't care.
I don't care who he is.
I don't care
what he's done.
I don't like a man
who cheats
On his wife.
Period.
That's all
just bullshit rumors.
I mean, the man
was a great man.
Well,
even if he did,
That doesn't
make him a bad man.
The man was the President
of the United States.
He's under a lot of pressure.
I think he's entitled.
Besides, he's screwing around
with Marilyn Monroe.
I think it's a sign
of a great individual
Who can seize
an opportunity like that.
You are demented,
Barry.
Ah, this is thinking.
This is
a thought process.
Thank you
for dinner, Molly.
It was delicious.
that corned beef and cabbage
Was a very close second
to our mother's.
I hate to tell you
this, but, uh...
Jack made
the dinner.
Jackie...
An all-star
in the kitchen, too.
Barry, get this.
This just goes to show
How little my brothers
actually know about me.
I mean, they probably
see me like my dad,
Speaking of our
favorite wife-beating,
Child-abusing
alcoholic,
I, uh, went down
to the grave this morning.
And?
And...
I'm happy to report
that he's still dead.
This is
funny stuff, Barry.
Take it
on the road, pal.
Anyway, see,
these guys see me
As this old-fashioned,
conservative,
By-the-book
kind of Guy
When, in actuality,
I'm a progressively modern,
Politically correct
housewife.
you sound more like
Half a fag, Edith.
I could see you
wearing an apron,
You know,
with the skirt
And those heavy clogs
you like to wear,
Maybe a speedo thrown in
for added effect.
What do you think?
I think I'm going to
throw you two a beating.
Listen, you guys.
It's true. He does.
He cooks. He cleans.
He does the laundry.
Leaves me
all kinds of time
For all those things
I always wanted to do...
Like change
the oil in the car
And fix the sink
And mow the lawn.
I'd like
to propose a toast.
To Molly,
My lawn-mowing,
oil-changing,
Sink-fixing, beautiful,
Sweet, smart, sexy, sassy,
One-in-a-million
Irish lass
On her 30th birthday.
That means
stand up, people.
Come on. Get up.
I love you,
And although I missed
your first 25 years,
Here's hoping you'll keep me
around for another 30.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday,
Molly.
Happy birthday,
Molly.
what are you doing?
Nothing.
Let me ask you
something, Barry.
What do I do now?
Hmm?
What are you,
retarded?
You wipe it off,
And then you put it
in the dishwasher,
O.K., genius?
No. No, not the, 
I mean with my life.
You know,
I didn't think
College would
actually end.
I'm not ready
to go out
And be a real guy,
Get a real job.
I'm not ready to move
out of my dorm.
Do you know I didn't
even think about that?
Where the hell
am I going to live?
What the hell
are you worried about?
Susan told me
her father's already got
A job lined up
for you.
I know. I don't know
if I should take it.
Susan's starting
to scare me
A little bit, too.
Yeah, well, Susan does have
that effect on people.
The other night, Barry...
You know, we're in my dorm room
doing it...
{Y:i}Don't move.
{Y:i}What?
{Y:i}I think I broke it.
{Y:i}Oh, God.
{Y:i}Oh, whew.
{Y:i}Oh, thank God.
That was close.
{Y:i}They make these things
so tight.
{Y:i}They ought to
make them bigger
{Y:i}For guys like,
{Y:i}Shut up.
{Y:i}Yeah, you know
that, baby.
{Y:i}I don't even know
why you bother.
{Y:i}I'm on the pill.
{Y:i}Hey, you can't be
too careful.
{Y:i}And remember,
I'm catholic.
{Y:i}I shouldn't even
be doing this.
{Y:i}You know...
{Y:i}We wouldn't even
have to worry about it
{Y:i}If we got married.
She said that?
Married?
What is she, crazy?
Yeah, yeah,
I think so.
So what do I do
about this now?
You got to
break up with her.
You got to dump her.
Before you know it,
She'll have you picking
out wedding cakes.
You'll be asking me
to be your best man
And moving into her
parents' guest room
Or worse, moving up
Into our old room
in the attic.
So you think I should
break up with her?
Yeah.
You got to.
Thanks for driving me
into the city, Jack.
You really didn't
have to do that.

hey, no problem.
Barry and half
a bottle of whiskey's
Not my idea
of safe driving.
So...
Other than cook
corned beef and cabbage
On his wife's birthday...
What does a high-school
basketball coach
Do with his spare time?
Oh, things like
play golf,
Fish, drink
a lot of beers.
But I'm actually taking
A sports management course
at NYU Right now.
Oh.
Very exciting.
And, uh, Molly, 
what does she do?
She teaches English
at the high school.
She's a teacher, too.
{Y:i}Really exciting.
Ha ha ha!
What, did you two meet
At a PTA Meeting
or something?
No, it was actually
during cafeteria duty.
On the hot-lunch line,
I hope.
Yeah, something
like that.
I'll bet you were a big
jock stud in high school,
Running around
in the backseat
Of your father's Buick
Breaking all
the little girls' hearts.
No. I've always
been pretty much
A one-woman
kind of guy.
Huh. Ha ha ha!
That's what
my ex-husband said
When I met him.
And he wasn't.
No, he was.
I just wasn't a one-man
kind of girl.
I don't buy that.
You just Haven't found
the right man yet.
I've found
plenty of them.
My problem is that
they all want to marry me.
You know,
if I were smart...
I'd find myself
a nice married man.
What good
would that do you?
There would be
no question as to what
Either one of us wanted
from the relationship,
Now, would there?
Yeah. It's getting late.
Ha ha ha!
Yeah.
Do you feel
like coming up
For coffee
or something?
Oh, no, thanks.
I should be getting
back to the island,
You know,
traffic and stuff.
All right.
Some other time, then.
Yeah, some other time.
O.K., some other time.
O.K.
Thanks
for the ride, Jack.
Have a good night.
Bye.
Excuse me.
You're not
Mrs. Mckey, are you?
No. She just left.
What do you mean,
she just left?
She was here
a minute ago.
Now she's not.
Well, do you know
where she went?
She was supposed to
show me an apartment.
{Y:i}Oh, you're the one.
I'm the one what?
She wanted to leave
before you got here.
What did I do?
She said
you sounded crazy.
She didn't want
to face you.
Me, crazy?
She's the crazy one.
Who does business
like this?
Do you know
where she went?
Maybe she'll show it to me
after she meets me.
She rented it.
That's why
she felt bad.
I just spoke to her
10 minutes ago.
Who could she
have rented it to?
Me.
You?
So you stole
my apartment?
That's not
a nice way to put it.
I'm not feeling nice.
I've been looking
at apartments all day.
This one was finally
in my ballpark.
{Y:i}C'est la vie.
Let me look at it.
We could bid on it.
That's fair.
Whoever told you life
is fair? Good-bye!
You know,
hold up a second.
I'm really sorry.
Um, my name is Barry.
Hello, Barry.
I was thinking...
Why don't we go out
for coffee?
We could work
something out.
Thank you, Barry.
I'm a married woman.
You're married?
I don't think my husband
would appreciate me
Going out for drinks
with a strange man.
Good-bye.
Oh, man.
I'm a complete loser.
You'll love
this place, Patrick.
It's only
a one-bedroom,
But daddy says
it's big enough.
He paid for the first
six months' rent.
I got it
through his friend.
It will be great
until we're married.
We can move
to that two-bedroom
On the fourth floor.
I can't do it.
Can't do what?
I can't move into
this apartment with you.
Why not?
It's perfect.
I'm sure it is,
But ethically, morally,
I can't do it.
I can't live with a woman
I'm not married to.
We would need
to get married
In order for me
to feel comfortable.
We're going to get
married eventually,
So what's
the difference?
The difference is,
we're not married now.
Therefore, I'd be
living in sin.
We're not living in sin!
We love each other.
What is that?
What does that mean?
Listen,
There's no amendment
to the rule,
I can't do it.
That's
the bottom line.
I know what you're
doing here, you know.
You're just afraid
of making a commitment.
You don't want
to live with me.
You're using this
as an excuse.
You're not willing
to make a commitment.
No.
No, Susan,
it's not that.
I swear.
Then what is it?
It's I'm a catholic,
that's what it is,
And there's certain
rules and regulations
You got to live by.
I'm living by them!
Hey, for the same
reason
You won't eat a bacon
cheeseburger, huh?
This is part
of my baggage.
Well, then,
I really think
You should consider
converting
Because daddy
is going to be very upset.
{Y:i}She's right, isn't she?
{Y:i}But am I using
this living-in-sin thing
{Y:i}Because I really don't want
to live with her,
{Y:i}Or do I really believe
I should wait
{Y:i}Until I'm married?
{Y:i}But if I obeyed
every rule
{Y:i}That said I should wait
till I get married,
{Y:i}I'd still be a virgin.
{Y:i}Is that any way
to go through life?
Well, I can't speak
For sally-boy
over here,
But for me...
A few weeks,
a month,
A month, tops.
I don't know.
Definitely longer
than a few weeks.
A month...
Thanksgiving.
Yeah, Thanksgiving
is definitely
The latest
I'll be here.
Thanksgiving?
Well...
Maybe not
Thanksgiving.
How about Christmas?
Yeah, Christmas will be
the latest I'm here.
New year's.
Definitely no longer
than New Year's.
Jack, I promise you
I won't be here
A day after
the new year,
Not a minute.
Not a second after
the clock strikes 12:00.
You can stay.
Take your old room in the attic.
It still has
All your old furniture
and shit in it.
I know I'll end up
Killing
one of those guys.
Ha ha ha!
Oh, you know what?
I forgot to tell you.
Ann called to thank you
for the dinner
And for driving her home.
She seemed like
such a nice lady,
Don't you think?
I suppose.
Shame Barry
doesn't like her.
Hey, Barry doesn't
like himself.
Are you sure you'll be
OK With all this?
Jack,
they're your brothers.
You don't say no
to family. Ha ha!
I would do anything
for them.
Of course,
if Patrick decides
To start wearing
my underwear...
Which he might.
Which he might.
Ha ha!
Besides, I think, uh...
I think
we ought to get used
To sharing this house
with some other people.
I've already had
plenty of practice
In that department,
thank you very much.
Well, you know, I'm not
getting any younger,
And you said
that we'd be having kids
Before I turned 30,
And in case
you forgot,
I turned 30
last week.
The only kids
running around here
Are in their 20s.
Come on, Molly.
Kids are a big step.
I know that,
But I'm ready
to make that step.
I don't care if we have
to make sacrifices.
Look. Kids need money
For food and clothing,
medication.
That means
no going to Ireland
To see your grandmother,
No more trips to Aruba,
no more restaurants.
We won't be able
to afford it.
Well, good,
Because I can't stand
my grandmother,
I hate Aruba,
and I'd rather cook.
I want a family, Jack.
I want a house that's
teeming with little kids
Running up and down
the stairs.
I want to cheer for them
at baseball games
And hold them when
they scrape their knees.
You said that's what
you wanted, too.
I do. I do.
I still want
those things.
I just don't want
to rush into it.
I just...
I just need to know
that we're ready.
I'm ready, Jack.
You let me know
when you are, too.
Excuse me.
Do you know where
121 Jane street is?
Yeah, 121, I think,
is down this way.
Hey, do I know you
from somewhere?
Are you sure?
I've got an audition
I'm already late for.
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure.
I know I know you
from somewhere.
Do you mind walking me?
I just can't make sense
of these streets.
Well, that's 121
right over there.
Oh, great.
Hey, thanks again.
I hope I didn't put
you out of your way.
No, not at all.
I know where
I know you from!
You're the creep
who wanted
To rent
my apartment.
That's you?
You look so different.
You kept bugging me
to go out with you.
I just asked you
to go for coffee.
I told you
I was married.
You're not?
No. I said that
to get rid of you.
Why would you want
to do that?
First of all,
You accused me
of stealing your apartment.
Second, I never go out
with strange men.
I'm not exactly
a stranger anymore.
I did help you
find this place.
And third, I'm engaged.
Engaged?
To be married...
To Henry,
A very nice young man.
How do I look?
Absolutely beautiful.
Thanks.
I'm telling you, Jack.
She was beautiful.
And she didn't fall
For your phony
Irish charm?
She didn't give me
the time of day.
I was thinking
she'd feel bad for me,
Maybe invite me
to move in with her.
Why should she
feel bad for you?
Because she stole
the apartment from under me.
Instead of living
in the village,
I'm on long island
with you and Amy fisher
And the rest
of the gang.
You say that now,
But you'll
change your tune
After you have kids.
Everybody does.
I'm never having kids.
That's not a problem.
And you're never
getting married?
No. I'll never have
enough interest
In any one woman
That I'd give up
the joys of bachelorhood.
I mean, the grass
is always greener.
Yeah, or thinner
or taller,
Bigger tits.
Yeah, hopefully
all those things...
Which is why,
you know,
Why I can't get over you.
I mean, Molly's great
and everything,
But you guys have been
together, what, five years?
How do you
keep it interesting?
Love.
You ever, uh...
You ever cheat on her?
No.
You never even, like...
You know, just, like,
thought about it?
No, not really.
You're a better man
than me.
Well, that's not
a stretch.
Hello.
Hello?
Hmm.
Hello? Yeah.
May I have the number
For the school
of continuing education
At NYU?
Ann.
Jack.
How are you?
Hi. What are you
doing in the city?
I just got out
of class,
Those sports
management courses
I was telling you
about?
What are you doing?
Running from
meeting to meeting.
Do you have time for
that cup of coffee?
Oh, I'd love to.
Ooh!
But I'm actually
running late.
Maybe some other time?
Yeah. Sure.
Some other time
would be great.
O.K.,
some other time, then.
Nice to see you.
Good to see you,
too.
You know what?
How about a walk
in the park instead?
O.K.
Fantastic.
You ever cheated
on Molly?
No.
Never even
thought about it?
No, not really.
None of those
high-school girls
Ever tempted you?
If I had a teacher
that looked like you,
I would have done
everything in my power
To get you to keep me
after school.
You're nuts,
you know that?
Besides, I coach
the boys' basketball team.
Then I'd become
a cheerleader.
You said you
never even thought
About cheating
on Molly.
Does that mean
You're thinking
about it now?
No.
You should.
I don't think
I could ever
Do that
to Molly.
You wouldn't be
doing it to Molly.
I keep thinking
About that night
in the car,
What would have happened
if I'd just...
Grabbed you and...
Kissed you.
Because I know
you wanted me, too.
Come on, Jack.
Kiss me.
Ann,
I can't do this.
I could never
do that to Molly.
I love her.
I don't want love.
I want you.
Listen,
I got to go.
Do you love her?
Yes, I love her.
That's because
we've been together
For so long.
I have nice memories
of those times.
But, no, I am not
in love with her.
Pat...
Are you ready
to spend
The rest
of your life
Having sex with
this one woman?
She'll be
the last woman
That you get to see
completely naked
And be allowed
to touch.
That's something
to think about.
I don't know.
I thought
I'd know
When it was time
to get married.
I'd envisioned
meeting somebody
Somewhere,
and...
I thought
it was Susan,
But...
Then it fades,
you know?
It turns out to be
just my imagination.
What I'm talking
about is real.
I mean two people
Mapping out
an eternity
In a moment.
And we'd sit
And have intimate
conversation
In some dimly lit
room, and...
We'd feel there was
Nowhere else
in the world
We'd want to be.
Jesus Christ,
Patrick.
I mean, that is
very romantic,
But there is no
fucking Chance in hell
That's going to
happen,
Especially
to the likes of you.
You don't believe
in true love?
You don't believe
God has someone
just for you
And he allows
a lucky few
To find one another?
How did a fruitcake
like you
End up
as my brother?
No, I do not believe
in true love,
But if there is
such a thing
As true love,
I'm sure God has
nothing to do with it.
You're just afraid.
You're just afraid
To fall in love,
Barry.
Always been afraid
of the emotions.
{Y:i}Listen, lover boy,
we're not on Oprah,
Talking about me
and my emotions.
We're talking
about you and Susan.
So, what do I do?
If I move in
with her,
I'm basically
saying yes.
Yes, I'll eventually
marry her.
Or do I wait till
I find my true love?
I could give
two shits
About you
and your true love,
But as far
as Susan goes...
She's got to
get the ax.
Yeah.
Yeah. I was
thinking that, too.
But I'm afraid,
Barry.
I mean, she is
so in love with me.
I'm afraid she'll
do something crazy
Like kill herself.
Don't flatter
yourself, Patrick,
All right?
Nobody is
killing themselves
Over you.
So how do I do it?
You came
to the right man.
It's really
quite simple,
But the key
Is finding
the right place.
I mean, I like to
meet them at work.
There's a lot
of people around.
They won't make
a big scene.
Then you don't
have to worry
About driving
them home
After you just
broke their heart.
Yeah.
Yeah. That's
good thinking.
What do you mean?
When did this
come about?
Look,
it's just something
I've been
thinking about
For a long time.
The fact that you
Wouldn't
live with me
And the fact that
you're not Jewish
Made it
a whole lot easier.
But why?
Patrick,
our relationship
Has run its course.
I think
we're better off
Going out and
finding new people,
New experiences,
ideas.
Hey, hey,
I don't need
any new ideas.
I'm confused
enough already.
But what about us?
We were going to
get married.
Come on, Patrick.
That was just talk,
right?
We were just kids.
Besides, would you
ever be willing
To become Jewish?
Huh?
Become a Jew?
Yes.
{Y:i}Convert?
Why should I convert?
I'm a practicing catholic,
for God's sakes.
I go to church
once a week.
You go to temple
once a year.
My religion plays
a bigger part in my life
Than yours does
in yours.
If anyone should convert,
it should be you.
Your religion
is crazy.
I don't even know
Why I'm talking
to you about this.
Look, it's over,
Patrick, OK?
I'm sorry.
{Y:i}What does that mean,
{Y:i}Experiencing
different people?
{Y:i}She's going to have sex
with other people.
{Y:i}That's what that means.
{Y:i}This is fine.
This is absolutely fine.
{Y:i}This just sucks.
{Y:i}That worked
brilliantly, Barry.
{Y:i}Get them
in the office,
{Y:i}You know,
{Y:i}Not going to
make a scene,
{Y:i}Lots of people
around.
{Y:i}She's completely
levelheaded
{Y:i}About the whole thing.
{Y:i}I'm on my feet
defending my religion...
{Y:i}Lamely.
{Y:i}Unbelievable.
{Y:i}I should have to
do this?
{Y:i}If she were
a catholic girl,
{Y:i}Believe me you...
O.K. I lived up
To my end
of the bargain,
No business
during lunch.
Lunch is now
officially over,
So please tell me
You're working
on something new.
I'm just...
I'm not
feeling inspired.
In fact, I'm not feeling
much of anything.
What's wrong
this time?
I don't know.
I can't get into
anything I'm writing.
I feel like I'm just
going through the motions.
Listen,
you'd better find
Some inspiration
soon.
For one thing,
you need the money,
And it's
embarrassing.
I've got to tell
The people
in my business
That my best
young writer
Lives
on long island.
Writers live
in Manhattan, Barry.
Joey Buttafuocos
live on long island.
You know
what I'm saying?
I got the idea.
You need to find
another girlfriend
With a posh
Manhattan apartment
And set yourself up
again.
What happened
with Ann?
Ann's perfect,
And you go and blow
a relationship.
What's with that?
She was nothing
but a pain in the ass.
That pain in the ass
told me
That Barry
takes her out twice
And Barry passes out
on her twice.
You drink too much,
man.
This little
Hemingway thing
You have going
is getting stale.
You know what, Marty?
Blow me.
O.K., OK
Forget Ann.
Ann's old news.
Listen...
I got a new girl
I want to
set you up with.
She's perfect.
No. I swear to you
I had nothing
to do with it.
It just must have
been fate.
I think it had
more to do with Marty
Than fate.
Well, maybe.
So anyway,
you and your fiance,
You guys
enjoying life
In my apartment?
No. He doesn't live
in new York.
Really?
Let me ask you another
semi-personal question.
You can ask it,
But I can't
guarantee
You're going to
get an answer.
All right.
That's fair.
Why would you agree to go
On a blind date with me
If you're
already engaged
To this Henry,
the horse farmer?
I'm not happy in
that relationship.
I don't want to
sell myself short.
Besides,
Marty said you were
A relatively nice
guy.
Here we are.
I still cannot
forgive you
For forcing me
into exile
Out on long island.
Come on. It can't
be that bad.
{Y:i}It is that bad.
You're not 25
and living
With your two brothers
at home.
Barry, I had a really
good time today.
I figured
I'd hate you.
Oh, thanks.
That's nice.
I knew
that I'd like you.
From the first time
that we met
Here on the stoop
When you stole
this apartment from me,
I knew
that I'd like you.
Barry, I got to go.
Yeah. No. No.
That's OK
You want to
get together
Some other time?
Maybe we could go,
you know,
Catch an Audrey Hepburn
film at theatre 80
Or something?
I...
I can't, Barry.
It wouldn't be
fair to Henry.
All right.
Um...
Well, then,
some other time, then.
O.K.
O.K. I'll see you
around, then.
Bye.
Bye.
Barry?
I really
liked you.
I just can't.
I'm sorry.
No. That's all right.
I mean...
You know,
you're engaged.
For all
practical purposes,
I'm a married woman.
Yeah.
I'll see you around.
O.K.
Bye.
Hey!
Patrick?
Leslie?
Hey!
Oh, God.
I thought
that was you.
Yeah.
What are you
doing?
Well, just coming back
from the deli, actually.
I got a sandwich.
What about you?
What are you up to?
Oh, I'm just working
on my dad's car.
Oh, good.
O.K.
See you around.
Yeah. O.K. Bye.
Ooh, Patrick!
Um, do you
want a beer
With that sandwich
or something?
O.K. Sure!
So, Patrick,
you of all people,
God!
What the hell are you
doing back here?
I had to move
back in with Jack.
Me and Barry
Are sharing
a crawl space
Up in the attic.
But I heard
that your, um...
That your
girlfriend's father
Was getting you
a place in the city.
Yeah.
I thought so, too,
But it doesn't look
Like that's
going to work out.
You, uh...
You got scared,
Didn't you?
No, I didn't.
Ha ha ha!
I mean,
I was, but...
You know,
I wasn't.
Uh-huh.
Her father was also
getting me this job.
It just seemed like
all of a sudden
I had to be this...
This real Guy
With a real life.
I just was not ready
for that.
So, yeah,
I got scared,
And I just
wanted out
Of the whole
situation.
So...
What did you do?
Well,
I didn't have to do
Anything, actually.
She broke up
with me.
Now she's got me
thinking
That maybe I do want
all those things
I thought
I was afraid of.
You know what?
It sounds to me
like you just want them
Because you can't
have them.
So, uh...
Why did she
break up with you?
See, that's weird,
too. She's weird.
She wouldn't
tell me.
Isn't that stupid?
So do you, uh...
Do you
still love her?
Uh, not like
I think I should,
I mean, considering
We were going to
get married.
What about you?
I heard you were getting
married to sully.
No, no.
I couldn't
go through with it.
What happened?
I...I saw the light.
Um, it was the morning
of my wedding.
I was up
in the bathroom,
Brushing my teeth,
And that's
when it hit me.
I suddenly thought,
{Y:i}Mom!
Just take it easy.
This is it, 
one time,
And then you're
done with it.
Ahem.
It's not
a twist-off, Jack.
I see.
Don't be so nervous.
This will only hurt
a little bit, OK?
Come here.
That was nice,
wasn't it?
Mmm, I'll say.
Though I
have to admit,
I was a little quick
the first time.
But I've been
ready to burst
Since that day
in the park.
You wanted me that night
in the car, too,
Didn't you?
Mm-hmm.         Mm-hmm.
You could have had me
right then and there.
What made you decide
to change your mind?
I don't know, 
something you said
About
never having sex
With another person
For the rest
of my life.
Hmm.
You'll find
it's harder to say no
The next time.
Yeah, but there's
not going to be
A next time.
Why'd she do it?
Patrick,
I'll tell you
For the last time.
She doesn't really
Want to break up
with you.
She's using this
to get back at you.
She wants you
To come crawling
back to her.
So how do I
get her back?
Why do you
even care?
I thought this is
what you wanted.
She saved you
the trouble
Of doing the dirty
work yourself.
You should
be happy.
But I miss her.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
You just think
you do.
You're suffering
No. I think it's a case
Oh, tell me.
What was so great
about Susan
That you now regret
not having it?
Her father was
going to get me
An apartment
and a great new job.
Those...Those are
definite pluses,
But listen
to the advice
Of your bigger, wiser,
And more experienced
brother.
I have a theory.
Man is like a banana,
Strong and firm,
bright and phallic,
And he's protected
By his
all-important shield.
But when a woman
comes along,
She sees this bright,
phallic beast,
And she wants it.
But she's not happy
with the way it is.
She wants to see
what's inside,
So she starts
to peel away
The all-important
shield.
First, she wants to see
your romantic side.
Then she wants to see
your passionate side.
Then she wants
to see your soft, caring,
Feminine side.
And she keeps
peeling and peeling
Until you're left there
buck naked,
Totally exposed
With your balls
blowing in the wind.
That's when she
gets her knife,
And she starts to
cut away your manhood,
Piece by piece,
Until they're
having your cock
In their corn flakes.
Susan!
Su,
Susan, would you,
Come on, Susan.
Would you hold up
a second?
I need to talk
to you.
What do you want?
You broke up with me
Without
an explanation.
I think I'm entitled
to an explanation.
We were going to
get married,
In case you forgot.
Tell me the truth.
Did you ever really
want to get married?
The truth?
The truth is no,
But that's
because,
That's before
I realized
How much I need you
in my life.
You don't need me.
You just think you do.
What is
the difference?
This is where I am.
I just don't think
it would be healthy
For either one of us
To stay together
right now,
Especially considering
the current situation.
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.
What current
situation?
Patrick,
I really don't feel
Like talking to you
right now.
Will you just
leave me alone?
I can't believe
you liked that movie.
It was fun.
It was crap.
You'll have to read
my new script.
Why? What's it about?
It's about this Guy
And his quest
for true love.
But does he find it?
Of course not.
You've never been
in love, have you?
Well...
You Haven't,
have you?
Do you love anybody?
Well, yeah.
I mean, you know,
I love, uh,
I guess I love
my brothers.
I love my mother.
In fact, I love
my mother very much.
And does your mommy
Live with you
and your brothers, too?
No. My mommy
actually
Moved back
to Ireland
A couple years ago.
Ireland? Why?
You'll love
this story.
This is
right up your alley.
It was about
five years ago.
My dad
finally died.
We were all very
excited about that.
And right after
his funeral,
My mom
pulls me aside,
And she says
to me...
{Y:i}Promise me
you won't make
{Y:i}The same mistake
I made.
{Y:i}Yeah. Yeah.
I promise.
Yeah. She took off
that night.
Oh. Why would she
marry your dad
If she didn't
love him?
Because she's
catholic, I guess.
She fell in love
with this guy,
Finbar O'Shaughnessy,
whom I'm named after,
Although my dad
didn't know that,
But she was
already pregnant
With my dad's baby,
Which is
my brother Jack.
So like any good
catholic girl would,
She got married.
They ended up
moving to America,
And she had to wait
35 years
Until the old man
died
So she could
go back to Ireland
And finally
be reunited
With her true love.
Wow. That is
a great love story.
With a mom like that,
You'd think you'd be
a hopeless romantic
Instead of
a loveless pessimist.
I like being
a pessimist.
It makes it easier
To deal with my
inevitable failure.
So where's
your mom now?
She and O'Shaughnessy
live in Dublin.
He's a champion
fiddle player,
So whenever they come
to new York to perform,
The whole band
comes out to the house,
And my mom cooks
Her famous corned beef
and cabbage.
Mmm! I love corned
beef and cabbage.
Yeah.
Well, we'll see.
O.K., Finbar,
just lean back and do it.
Come on, you coward.
Just do it.
Barry, I have
a confession to make.
Well, what is it?
Promise me
you won't be mad.
How can I be mad
If I don't know
what you're confessing?
I'm not engaged.
Henry's asked me
a thousand times,
But I cannot bring
myself to say yes.
Really?
I mean, that's great.
I mean, it's too bad
for Henry,
But he's not really high
on my list of concerns.
Are you happy?
Fucking-a, I'm happy.
That's great.
Would you mind, uh...
If we kissed again?
Think you
can handle it?
I think
I can handle it.
{Y:i}Yeah, right.
{Y:i}There's no way
you can handle this.
Hey, doll.
How are
the papers coming?
Hey, good.
You coming to bed soon?
I miss you.
I feel like we never get
to see each other anymore.
Yeah, I know, but
I'm hitting the sack.
I'm kind of tired.
Think I'll finish grading
these in the morning.
Why?
You're better off
Getting them done
tonight.
Well, I was, uh...
I was thinking
you might be interested
In doing
a little something
You Haven't done
in a while.
I thought you got
embarrassed by that.
Well...
Maybe I'm feeling
A little less
inhibited tonight.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm not in the mood.
I'm tired.
Wow!
Ooh...
I remember when
you used to say,
The one night
I'm not in the mood,
You're breaking
my balls about it?
How about the nights
you weren't in the mood?
I'm sorry, Jack.
I was just kidding.
I guess I thought
It might be fun,
that's all.
Look, I'm sorry
I yelled at you, hon.
I've been feeling
kind of weird these days.
I don't know.
Barry, if you like her
that much,
Just call her up
and ask her out again.
Yeah, but she's
not Irish.
Well, then you got to
forget about it.
I don't know
if I can.
I mean...
She is the most
beautiful woman
That I have ever
been in contact with.
I mean,
she is gorgeous.
She's proved that
God is indeed a man.
{Y:i}You are in love.
Don't talk to me
about love.
All I said was
she's beautiful.
I said nothing
about love.
No, no, no, no, no.
You're in love.
Trust me.
I know when someone is
or isn't in love.
Hey, doll.
Hey, honey.
What, are you drinking
all my frigging beers?
I'm having one beer.
Give me a fucking break.
It's not even noon,
And you're drinking
already.
When did you
all of a sudden
Become my mother?
I can't drink beer
anymore?
You can tell me
when I can and can't drink?
I'm not your mother,
But when I come back
from jogging,
I want some beers
in the house, OK?
You're going out
for a run, Jack?
I'm working off
these love handles.
You could use it,
lard ass.
Hey, you want
some company?
I'd love to go
for a run.
No, that's
all right.
I'm just
hopping out
For a quickie.
I'll be back.
Yeah, have a few
more doughnuts
While you're
at it, fat boy.
Do you
think, uh...
Do you think
Jack would ever
have an affair?
Jack?
No way, no how.
I mean, he loves you.
You were the answer
to that guy's dreams.
Besides, do you think
There's somebody out there
better than you?
Nah, I don't know.
I don't know.
He just seems kind
of distant lately.
Maybe I'm bugging
him too much
About having a baby.
A minute
doesn't pass by
Where I don't think
about making love to you.
Easy there, coach.
There will be
no lovemaking
Going on here.
It's a figure
of speech.
Next time,
try another figure,
Like I would say,
All right.
How about...
Very good.
Hey, who's in there?
It's me.
Hey, I'm going
to the bathroom!
I'm coming in.
I've got to
get something.
What...
Oh, Jesus.
How about
a mercy flush?
What the hell do you
expect it to smell like?
Hey, I'm going
to the bathroom here.
Do you mind?
You ought
to see a doctor.
Either that,
Or Molly should
change butchers.
Very funny.
Patrick,
Patrick,
I got to talk
to you.
What is it?
Let me ask you
something.
You're Mr. Ten
commandments, right?
How bad a sin
is adultery?
You're cheating
on Molly?
No, I'm not
cheating on Molly.
But, you know,
I am starting
to get feelings
For other women now,
and, uh...
I was
just wondering,
If I did give in
to temptation,
Then how bad
a sin is that?
It's horrible.
Jack, you can't do it.
First of all,
it's a big-time sin.
Second of all,
I love Molly.
You can't do something
like that to her.
How could you ever
want to cheat on Molly?
She's the greatest.
Yeah, I know,
I know,
But sometimes
you need
A change
in your life.
I don't want
to do anything,
But Molly and I
have been together
Almost five
frigging years.
I'm stunned.
I can't believe this.
You're actually
considering
Sticking your penis
into another woman.
Well, that's usually
how it works.
Jack, you've
got to fight it.
That's, it's just
not fair to Molly.
Inasmuch as we don't
believe in it,
I would say
get a divorce
Before you do
something like that.
Who is she?
It's nobody, really.
I'm...
I'm just thinking.
Come on, Jack.
She's somebody.
No, she's nobody,
OK?
Don't say a word
to Barry either,
All right?
Of course not.
And listen,
don't forget
To wipe yourself,
all right?
How do you know whether
the one you're with
Is your true soul mate?
And then,
what if you let them go
And never find anybody
to replace them?
Yeah, but I think
You're better off
being alone
Than being with somebody
That isn't
your true soul mate.
Anyway, sometimes you've
just got to take chances.
You know, uh...
Speaking of chances,
{Y:i}Well,
not taking them...
You know, I,
I always
sort of wanted
To ask you out
in high school.
But, you know,
you were always
With sully
or something.
I never did.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Well, you should have.
So, um...
So what are you
going to do now?
Well, after I canceled
my wedding, I, um...
I reevaluated
my whole life, and...
I became a vegetarian...
A pro-choice activist...
And I, uh...
I abandoned Catholicism.
Really?
But I remember
a Summer
You were going away
to that convent!
But you were going
to be a nun!
What is this?
Why would you
abandon Catholicism?
Because I tried
to figure out
Why I said yes
to James,
And that's when
it hit me.
I mean, I thought
{Y:i}I had to get
married, you know?
What's a single
catholic girl
Going to do if she
doesn't get married?
I can't have
premarital sex,
But if I do, I can't
use birth control,
But if I don't
use birth control
And I get pregnant,
I can't have an abortion.
So what's a girl to do
while she's waiting
For prince charming
to show up?
I mean, Christ,
I can't even masturbate!
{Y:i}Tell me about that one.
If I masturbated as much
as I wanted to,
I would live in
a constant state of guilt...
Ha ha ha!
Not to mention
hospitalization.
I know. It's crazy.
You just,
You, you can't
be catholic
And have a healthy
sex life.
You just...
Unless you find
your true love.
Well, yeah,
OK, then...
Then and only...
Then.
I need to talk
to you.
What do you want?
I think I deserve
an explanation.
You deserve
an explanation?
Yes!
Well, this will knock
your catholic socks off!
The current situation is,
I'm pregnant.
{Y:i}You're pregnant
with my baby?
I've only been
with you, Patrick.
Jesus, Mary,
and Joseph!
How did this
happen?
We took every
precaution.
I even wore two
rubbers at once!
I thought you were
on the pill.
I thought you were
on top of this!
I was. I still am.
The pill is only
99% effective.
We fell into that 1%.
Why would you
Break up
with me now?
I would figure
You would want
to get married.
Hello! Patrick,
I'm 21 years old.
I don't want a baby.
If we got married,
You'd want me to have
the baby, right?
Of course.
Why? What else
would you do?
I'm going to have
an abortion.
{Y:i}An abortion?
You can't have
an abortion.
That's against
everything
I believe in!
Last time
I checked,
The baby was
in my stomach,
So I'll make
the decision.
That child
is half mine.
Not anymore.
Listen, Patrick,
I, I've got to go.
I'm sorry.
I knew you wouldn't
agree with my decision,
So that's why
I did what I did.
{Y:i}I'm going to hell.
Jack...
Do you believe
in hell?
Hey, I Haven't done
anything yet, OK?
I'm not talking
about you anyway.
I think
I'm going to hell.
Oh, Jesus Christ,
altar boy.
Why are you going
to hell this time?
First of all,
I had sex with Susan
out of wedlock.
So big deal.
Now I find out
The reason
she breaks up with me
Is because...
She's pregnant.
And now...
Now she's having
an abortion.
Oh, you're
shitting me.
You got her
pregnant?
Yeah.
Well, you just
be thankful
She's getting
an abortion.
Relax. You're not
going to hell.
She's having an abortion.
Can you believe that?
Good. Good for her.
Good for her.
Well, what about me?
I am a catholic.
My life is over.
I'm going to hell.
You know what
you should do?
You should come to
California with me.
Oh, solution
of solutions.
When are you going
to California?
As soon as I can
get enough money.
I've already got
2,000 saved,
And all I need is
another two grand
And I can buy
This beautiful mint
cherry 1970 Chevelle
I've had my eye on.
As soon as I can get
the money, I'm gone.
Drive
cross-country.
Hey, that
sounds great.
I could use some
adventure like that.
If you can come up
with $2,000,
We can leave
tomorrow.
Sure you could stand
To be alone with me
all that time?
It's a pretty long trip.
Well, I asked you,
didn't I?
Yeah.
What's this?
I thought you said
you didn't eat meat.
Only on Fridays.
What's wrong with you?
You've been acting
strange all day.
I just don't feel
that this is right.
I mean,
for Christ's sakes,
Don't you have
any guilt at all?
Don't get so high
and mighty on yourself.
In case
you Haven't noticed,
You've been
calling me lately,
Not the other
way around.
Look, I'm sorry.
This whole thing
has just got my head
Screwed up
right now.
You're having an affair.
It's not
a big fucking deal.
Well, it is to me.
I don't like
what I'm doing,
And I don't want
to hurt Molly.
I love her.
Get over yourself,
Jack.
If you loved Molly
so much,
You wouldn't
be jumping into my bed
Every Chance you get.
Great.
You know what?
Do me a favor.
I don't want to be
part of your confusion.
Don't bother coming up.
Call me when
you get a grip.
Damn!
What?
You got a problem?
You did it.
I did nothing, OK?
Oh, Jack, I told you
not to do it.
That is
a big-time sin.
Not to mention
what effect
It's going to
have on Molly,
Your marriage.
Yeah?
Don't say a word
to Molly or Barry.
You hear me?
What the...
Jack, I wouldn't
think of it. Jesus!
It was that Ann
That Barry used
to see, wasn't it?
Look, I fucked up,
OK?
I know I didn't
do the right thing,
But I felt I had
to do it anyway.
Look, I love Molly,
But who says
you got to be
100% faithful
to your wife anyway?
Just isn't natural.
God said.
Well, fuck God!
Why should I spend time
and waste Faith
In something I have
no proof ever existed?
Patrick, I'm a man.
I had an urge,
and I acted on it,
And I don't see that
as a big deal.
Well, that's a big deal
For Molly,
don't you think?
You'll have to
make a choice.
You can't go on this way.
First of all, Patrick,
This isn't your problem
to worry about.
Second of all,
I know what I got to do.
Hey, Jack?
I really
hope you do, man.
Where the hell
is that train already?
Hey, Finn!
Come sit by me.
Hey, you want to see
my new ring?
I've seen the ring.
Tell me what
it's called again.
It's called
a claddagh ring.
The hands represent
friendship,
And the crown on top
represents loyalty.
Well, what
about the heart?
The heart represents,
you know...
A deeper sort
of friendship.
You know, like a...
Just like
a deep friendship.
Friendship?
Yeah.
Not love.
No.
I mean, you know,
I, uh...
I guess the heart could
be looked at as love.
But enough about
the goddamn ring.
Did you read
the script yet or what?
I just got it
this afternoon.
You'll read it
tonight, though?
By the time I go
to sleep tonight,
It will have
been read.
Promise?
Barry, I'll read
the script.
Patrick,
what happened?
Let me guess,
You're not going
To California
anymore?
Can someone lend me
train fare?
She wants
you back?
She wants
me back.
What about
the baby?
She had
a miscarriage.
Oh, my God!
Jeez, talk about
The luck
of the Irish.
Jack!
It's great, isn't it?
Can I have 10 bucks?
I'll miss my train.
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Ha ha! Hey!
So, guess what.
Daddy said he's
going to buy you
That one-bedroom
on the first floor,
So that way,
we can at least
Be in the same
building,
And then,
after we're married,
We can move into
That beautiful
two-bedroom
On the fourth floor.
He's going to pay
for me to live
In the same building
with you?
Of course!
He loves me,
and I love you,
So he loves you.
He wants you
to start
In the sales
department.
He feels
it's the best way
To learn
the business.
Susan, I don't know
If I can work
for your father.
Why not? Hmm?
Because he's done
so much for me already.
No! Don't be silly.
It will be great.
We'll move in.
Everything
Will be fine.
And you know what
I was thinking...
{Y:i}Oh, God, I thank you.
{Y:i}I thank you for letting her
have that miscarriage.
{Y:i}But just look
at these sweaters.
...People over,
you know,
Like
Mary and Stewart,
And, Patrick?
Patrick, are you
listening to me?
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Listen, Susan,
I'm sorry...
But I don't want to work
In the garment
district, OK?
And I don't want to live
In the same
building with you.
Why not?
Because I, because I want
to move on with my life...
And because I don't
love you anymore.
You don't
love me anymore?
Get out of here.
Get out!
Get out of here,
Patrick! Leave!
Patrick, leave.
Get out.
Fine.
Come on!
Leslie!
I need
to talk to you.
Patrick! What's up?
You were serious
when you asked me
To come to California
with you, right?
Yeah.
Well, how do
you feel about me?
W-what do you mean?
Well...I mean,
How do you feel
about me?
Remember yesterday,
when we talked
About finding
your true love
And how great
that must be?
Yeah.
Well, I've got
a good idea.
I don't mean that.
I mean that,
But what I mean is,
I want to go
To California
with you.
I want you to come
to California with me.
I know.
You said that.
But how do you feel
about me?
What do you mean?
I mean,
do you mean do I,
You don't have to
say the words.
I just want to know
If you have
any idea,
Any feeling
in that way,
Just something.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah?
But you know I'm not
catholic anymore.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I thought
about that...
And I don't
give a shit.
What are you
doing out here
All by
your lonesome?
Just thinking.
It's awful quiet
Without those guys
around here.
I was thinking
Maybe we should
take a vacation.
What do you think?
I don't want
to run away from here
To work out
our problems, Jack.
This is our home.
If you feel like
you've got something
You got to
work out,
Let's just do it
right here.
Problems?
What are you
talking about?
What problems
do we have, Jack?
Are you
that far removed
From this
relationship?
Listen, I realize
I've been a little
distant lately, but,
Distant, Jack?
We Haven't had sex
in months!
Why don't you scream it
a little louder
So the whole fucking
neighborhood
Can hear you?
I'm going through
A weird period
in my life.
It seems like
just yesterday
I was a kid
in high school.
Suddenly, I'm 33
And thinking about
starting a family.
You're 15 years
too early
To be having
your midlife crisis.
I don't want
to become
Like my father,
A miserable
fucking prick
Who isn't there
for you,
Isn't there
for the kids.
The thing is
I don't even know
If I can be
a good father.
That's bullshit,
Jack,
And you know it.
Don't use kids
as your excuse.
The way
your father is
Is the exact reason
{Y:i}You would be
a great father.
You know that I
would never ask you
For a divorce,
And I'm willing
to wait for you
To do whatever
You feel like
you've got to do.
But out of respect
for me,
What we've had,
And what
we could have,
If you've got to
do something,
What the hell
are you talking about?
I'm not a fool,
Jack.
{Y:i}Dad, I just
stopped by today
{Y:i}To say good-bye
and let you know
{Y:i}I won't be
the kind of man
{Y:i}That you were.
{Y:i}Happy saint
Patrick's day.
Hey, pat.
Hey.
Can you talk?
Yeah. What's up?
I got, 
I got a problem.
What is it?
It's Audry.
Yeah. Marty thinks
something really big
Is going to happen
with the script.
He thinks
they'll want me
To come out
to California.
He said some really
big-name actresses
Are interested
in the lead.
O.K.
So...
So where's
the problem?
What am I going
to do about Audry?
I promised her
the part.
Do you love her?
I might.
So now you finally
Get a decent script
on your hands,
And you're going to
Throw
your inspiration
Right out
the window.
Just when things
Are starting
to happen for me,
I got to go
fall in love.
Is something
bothering you?
You've been
very distant
The last few days.
No. I got a lot on
my mind, that's all.
I spoke to Henry
last night.
He wants me to come
back to Virginia.
What are you
going to do?
I don't know.
What do you
want me to do?
I don't want you
To go back
to Virginia
To marry Henry.
But you don't know
If you want to continue
this relationship.
I don't know
what I want to do
About anything
right now, Audry.
You mean
you don't know
What you want
to do about us.
Everything happened
so quickly for us.
It took me
by surprise,
I guess.
I thought
we'd go out
For a few drinks,
have a few laughs,
And instead,
we got...
We got
really serious.
And that scares you?
Yeah, that
fucking scares me.
So...
What do we do now?
I don't know.
What do you think
we should do?
I don't know.
I just want to
be with you, Barry.
I don't know
if that's possible
Anymore, Audry.
I just need
some time
To figure
some things out.
Maybe we should
spend some time
Away
from one another,
Um, and see
how that works out.
Well, I'll wait for you
for a little while,
But I can't
wait forever.
O.K. I'm going to
go home now.
I'll see you
around, then?
It's palm Sunday.
I went to church.
Congratulations.
So, what did you
give up for lent?
I gave up resolutions
this year.
Convenient.
You know, you made
a mistake, Barry.
She doesn't want
a husband, man.
She wants you.
It's
the same thing
As far as I'm
concerned.
No, it's not
the same thing.
You get one Chance
in this life,
If you're lucky.
I'm sure there
will be others, pat.
No, there won't.
Just think
about mom.
Don't start
with that shit again.
Barry, if you
just took one second
To look at yourself,
You might discover
what you truly want.
Oh, yeah?
And what's that?
Why don't you
fucking tell me
What that is,
huh?
To ask her
to marry you.
Oh, I didn't know
you were home.
Yeah. I'm trying
to find
Some Fitzgerald
stories
For class
tomorrow.
Remember this?
Yeah.
Think we've lost
the romance
From our marriage?
No.
I just don't think
You're interested
anymore.
I think
that sometimes...
When we start to
grow
Accustomed
to things,
We start to, uh...
To not see them
anymore
Or to kind of
look past them.
And we have
a tendency to...
Want something new
because we feel
That will
fulfill whatever
Seems to be missing
in our lives.
But it doesn't.
I think we just
need to look back
{Y:i}At what we do have
in our lives
And try to remember
what brought us there
In the first place.
You know?
So why did you
do it, Jack?
What didn't I do
for you?
What are you
talking about?
I know that
You've been seeing
someone else, OK?
I found
your rubbers.
What rubbers?
I don't want to have
to fight for you!
Why can't you
just be a man
And admit it?
What do you
want me to say?
When did you become
Such
a fucking coward?
I want you to
tell me the truth.
Did you do it?
Why? Jack, why?
I am so sorry.
I just want to be
with you again.
I don't know,
you know?
I think it's
going to take
A long time.
I know. I know.
Is it over?
Yes, it's over.
Did you love her?
No.
Jesus Christ!
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
I think so.
Ha ha ha!
I don't know.
Did you?
Yeah. Yeah.
Why can't you?
Well...Well...Yeah.
I can.
I'm just
a little nervous.
Oh. Why?
What's wrong?
Listen.
There's something
I've got to
tell you.
What is it?
I got the money.
What money?
The 2,000.
My brother
wrote me a check.
For the c,
Oh, my God!
You mean we're going?
As soon as you want.
Aah! I love you!
Hey, that's just
The kind of Guy
I am.
Ha ha ha!
Did you go
to Dublin for these?
Yeah. How's
the jelly roll, huh?
I can't believe
this is it.
Told you I'd be
out of your hair
By Easter.
I can't believe you're
going through with this.
I didn't think
you had balls
Big enough
for a stunt like this.
Really.
It's got nothing
to do with my balls.
Ha ha!
You know?
It's got everything
to do with my heart.
When you find
your true companion,
Stop. Stop
right there.
Jesus. Yeah. Yeah.
I think we've all
Had enough
true love talk
To last us
a fucking lifetime.
You decided what
you're going to do
With Audry?
No. No.
I don't know.
I don't know
about you guys,
But these
past few weeks
Have really been
special for me.
I mean, living under
the same roof again,
It really felt like
a home, you know?
Like a family.
Yeah.
Despite the fact
That there wasn't
a psychotic drunk
Screaming for beers
And beating the shit
out of us every day.
What was that
shit he said
When he had
half a bag on?
And the time
I came home
In my
varsity jacket.
I remember he always
said to me,
Fucking prick.
What a prick
is right.
So, what time
Are you and Leslie
leaving?
She wants to get
on the road
Bright and early,
so she's figuring 5:00.
That's early.
You guys be up
for a good-bye
At that time?
I don't
think so.
You could bet your ass
That I won't be up
at 5:00 in the morning.
Well, I guess
this is it, then.
Yeah.
Thanks, Jack.
Anytime,
man.
I'll get you
that cash back
As soon as I can.
Whenever.
A handshake will do
for me, fruitcake.
Not for me,
Barry.
That's enough.
Hello.
No, Marty.
Barry's not here
right now.
Yeah. He should
be here soon.
Everything's fine.
Listen, I got to go.
I can't talk
right now.
Bye.
What's going on
with all these bags?
All your stuff's
in the blue bag.
What do you mean?
Are you
going someplace?
I'm moving out.
Where are you going?
I'm going home
to new jersey
To take care of
my dad for a while.
How come?
Because
you're a coward.
I just don't think
this is the right time
For me to get involved
in a serious relationship.
And why is that?
Because as
a big-time director,
You can't
be tied down?
Don't want to miss
all the action?
Is that
what you think?
Can you give me
another reason?
Because I'm
going to be busy.
I'm not going to
have time for this,
For us.
You know what?
You can
have this back.
I don't want it.
Audry, you knew
I wasn't interested
In letting this
become,
You know,
too serious.
I don't care
what we thought
Was going to happen.
I fell in love
with you.
You fell in love
with me, didn't you?
Come on. Let's not
get into this.
Just answer
the question.
It won't kill you.
What do you
want me to say?
I mean...
O.K., yeah.
I do love you.
Then why are you
doing this?
Because I don't
want to be in love,
And I don't want
a wife,
And I don't want
a family either.
Whoever said anything
About marriage
and a family?
I'm sorry, Audry.
It just...
It just can't be.
Go ahead
and answer it.
It's Marty.
You got
what you wanted.
Hello.
Hey, wait.
Hold on a second.
Hey, Audry,
wait a second.
I'm sorry
it had to be like this.
I love you,
Barry,
And I'll never
love anyone
The way
I love you.
But I won't be
like your mom
And wait 35 years
for you.
Hey, Audry, come on.
Hold up.
Hey, Marty.
Sorry about that.
No. No.
It's nothing.
Yeah. You know what?
Listen, I can't talk
about this.
I got to go.
Hey, Barry.
