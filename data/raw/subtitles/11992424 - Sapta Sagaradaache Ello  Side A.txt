“River oh! my river”
“I’ll await you forever”
“Longing for you”

“River oh! my river”

“Longing for you”
“In your path I linger”
“Somewhere beyond the seven seas”
Manu! Slow down.
We aren’t going that fast
Manu!
Slow down!
Don't worry, nothing will happen.
Manu, stop the car!
Manu!
Priya?!
Priya, where are you going?
Why do you care?
Ok, I am sorry. Please don’t leave.
Priya!
I can’t just leave the car here.
I’ll get into trouble.
Where was this sense when
you were driving like a maniac?
How much does this car cost?
I asked how much does this car cost?
About Rs 1 - 1.25 Cr
Your monthly salary is Rs 12,000
What if something had happened?
What can happen?
- Don’t you trust my driving?
- It's not about trust.
You'll have to work for
80 years to earn Rs1.5 Cr
80 years!
Do you get it?
Ok, I am sorry. Come, I’ll drop you home.
Second hand car will only take 40 years...
[Radio Show Chatter]
How is the practice going?
Why don’t you sing a little?
I am not a radio station.
That can belt out tunes on your command.
Oh?
When will you sing then, madam?
It depends on the singer's mood.
Singer needs to be in a good mood to sing.
Madam, you don't know about this singer...
You feel like listening to her forever.
Her anger…
Even better, you should
listen to her scold.
It’s also musical.
Idiot!
Bye
Bye? Where's my tax?
All taxes have been paid.
Go.
No, this is a special tax
Idiot...
That’s all.
Prabhu!
How many times should I warn you?
There are errors in the bills again!
If this happens again,
I will tell the boss.
Haven’t you left, Anna?
This guy! He is going to get it from me.
Why are you late?
Heavy traffic. Here are the bills.
Come early, Madam needs the car.
Siddappa!
- Boss is ready, bring the car.
- Ok, sir.
Manu, finish quickly.
We’ve to head to the factory.
Ok, just give me two minutes.
Where is Siddappa?
Sir, he is unwell.
Ok.
“The cloud seems shy on
its way to meet the sea”
“Evening ray colouring the sky asks”
"Shall I join thee?"
"There's a boat sailing far yonder..."
"Disappearing in its
isolation into a blur."
"Is this a dream somebody drew..."
"Shall I name that dream after you?"
Idiot!
How many times have I
told you not to whistle?
How many times do I tell you?
Your voice makes me crazy.
Excuse me?
I’m Andy...
I’m an assistant to
Bhargava, the music director.
Bhargava sir is an
alumni of this college...
He had come to meet his teacher.
Yes, we know him.
She listens to his songs all the time.
You sing very well...
He asked me to give you his card.
Come to the studio for voice trials.
Thank you.
Don't forget me, madam.
Today, you can hear me whistling...
- Tomorrow, when thousands whistle...
- Idiot!
Do you have any sense?
Is this how you maintain accounts?
All the bills are correct sir...
What happened?
Usual, its been going
on for 30 minutes now.
Things wont stay the same....
Why are you late?
There was heavy traffic.
The same excuse.
- Madam has to go to the temple.
- Ok.
What are you staring at?
- You want to go as well?
- No, sir.
- Anna?
- What is it?
Always the same thing...
Take this...
I will return it when I get the salary.
Ok, Leave now.
- Amma, I am getting late...
- Coming...
Careful!
Don't worry Amma.
- What did you give her?
- Rascal...
Stop watching TV. Do your homework!
What's the hurry for you both?
The wedding dates aren't fixed yet.
Amma, a home wont be waiting for us,
when we need it.
You have to pay rent until
the wedding, isn't it?
Amma, that’s why he’ll
shift from his room...
Hey rascal!
He will shift there immediately.
I don't understand.
Manu has come, I am leaving.
- I’ll come home late.
- Okay.
What did you gift her?
That wasn't a gift.
Switch off the TV! Do your homework!
What was in the box? Tell me please?
Let's go dude.
Dude?
Dude??
You better address me with
respect and extra love.
Idiot. You’ll get it from me.
It's getting late.
If you boss me,
I don’t want this marriage.
Manu!
How long have we been married?
How many years?
How long have you been married?
Two years.
There's no issue with
water or electricity...
Take a look at the house.
We'll talk details later.
Oh!
We can tell people that we live in a cave.
It sucks to keep
the lights on even in the day.
It doesn’t have to be on...
If the bedroom is dark, it's best!
That is all that you can think of.
This house doesn’t need
lights at night also.
It has that many windows
I like it very much.
I know.
What do you think of the kitchen?
It's ok.
Quite cramped, isn't it?
What do you think?
What would I know about the kitchen?
Correct! As long as you
get good food on time.
Not exactly.
I don't need a special feast everyday.
Only five days a week.
Oh you poor thing!
You'll eat regular food for two days?
That wont do. I have a better idea.
What?
Our next-door aunty is a cook.
Her husband ran away.
I'll will give you her contact.
You can marry her.
Do you have aunty’s photo?
No?
There is another room, isn't there?
Sir, how about rent?
Rent is negotiable, don't worry.
Isn't the colour nice?
There are no problems here.
You can ask her.
If her husband hadn't been transferred,
they would have stayed on.
The sound of the train...
It’ll take only a week...
To get used to it.
I think that lady hasn't slept
in two years!
How many times do I teach you
how to relish a puff?
Look here...
The joy is in the crunch...
And the crumbs sticking to your face!
I prefer it that way
If you like it so much, take this...
Wash your face with it
Its your loss.
That house was nice, wasn't it?
You liked the blue wall, didn't you?
Don’t worry, Putti.
The next house is going to be the one
Guaranteed!
Putti, wait up, where are you going?
No human could have done that.
It’s pure art.
- Just have a look.
- Manu...
What happened?
No!
You don’t need to spend money to dream.
Okay, are you done?
Enough dreaming, let's leave.
Sometimes being stupid makes
for good memories
Manu...
Trust me.
Manu. Look...
This is where people bathe, no?
Idiot!
It’s a 3BHK. Interiors will be done.
You get 2 balconies...
We can give you possession in September.
Come in and have a look.
Keep looking, I’ll be back.
- The light is great, isn't it?
- Yes.
Isn't it nice?
What is it?
Nothing.
I fast forwarded into our life...
What did you see?
We've been married for three years.
We are expecting our little one.
My travel business is doing well.
You have become a famous singer.
Your song has just released
and it's a super hit.
We are tired of renting.
We have come to buy a house.
Sir, there is another
unit on the 12th floor.
Want to take a look?
- No.
- No.
- This is nice?
- Its perfect.
No thanks.
We still haven't found
a house in the present.
I'll find one by the time you return
from your hometown...
She won’t Aunty,
You message me once you reach.
Yes. I will.
Stay a few extra days.
I'll get some relief from her!
I wanted to leave her behind here too.
So that I can be in peace!
- What?
- Nothing
Akka, I got two packets of chips!
You got him chips?
He’s going to fart all night.
You're in for a treat tonight!
Look at him, Amma.
Sit down.
Come...
- Okay. Bye Aunty.
- Bye Manu.
It's late, get going...
Just because you're off to the seaside,
you're in a rush to send me off!
Yes
It’s just a lot of water!
What’s the big deal?
You haven’t seen it,
You wont understand it’s beauty.
Like the saying goes...
What would a blind person
know about colour.
There's also a saying that people
from the coast are arrogant!
Of course!
Ok it's getting late. Go now.
I told you I don't need anything.
Who said it's for you?
Who said it's for you?
It's for your brother. Pass it on.
Idiot!
Priya?
Putti?
Priya?
Are you still upset?
You know what...
You will like Bangalore...
- In your school...
- There is no sea in Bangalore, is there?
Close your eyes...
For my sake, please?
Look at this conch...
It’s so far away from the sea.
Yet, it echoes with
the sound of the sea.
You are also like this conch.
Even if you go to Bangalore,
the sea will always be with you.
Don’t ever forget that.
Take this.
Amma has made hot snacks for you...
Putti...
Idiot!
- Dumbo, are you by the beach?
- Yes
Putti, I will drop madam and
call you back.
Manu, please don't hang up.
Please.
Madam is here.
You just listen to me. I will speak.
Don’t hang up!
Wait a minute...
- You are always on the phone...
- Sorry madam.
You know how to say sorry. Get going
In Bangalore, all you can hear is traffic.
Shall we make our home here?
Next to the sea?
The sound of the sea...
It's such a joy to hear it!
It makes me want to sing my heart out!
I have never said this before.
I get the same feeling when I'm with you.
Manu, you are my sea.
I can’t keep kissing this a♪♪ anymore.
What a life...
- Hello, sir.
- Are you at the farm?
- Yes sir.
- Get it cleaned correctly
- I am here...
- It should smell nice.
- There is no stench, sir.
- Finish and come to office.
Hey, spray some perfume,
I can smell the shit.
Okay sir.
Next he’ll make me check if the horse
shits properly. What an A♪♪♪♪♪♪.
I feel like I cant see you clearly...
Maybe I am going blind?
Stop kidding! Anna.
Maybe there is a problem with the glasses.
Its not like that...
I am short sighted.
Anna, I need to ask you something...
[Reads out a headline about a crime]
Look, it’s so clear to read when it’s near.
I don’t know why crime is interesting.
Forget that.
You have a house in the village, right?
Can you read that board?
It's written it English.
Good, that you can see that far.
Hey, are you done with the perfume?
- Get the bill.
- Yes sir
Your village home, how much does it cost?
Is it close to the sea?
If you open the tap,
the fish swim right into the pan.
How much would it cost to
build a house near the sea?
Sir?
Add extra Rs.10,000 for chemicals
Why are you asking?
Planning to settle down
with your girl there?
Take this.
Let’s go.
People work their entire lives and
can’t buy a tiny piece of land.
He wants a house by the beach.
Come, we have to get back quickly.
Swami will chew my head otherwise.
Yes, Putti?
The film is about to start. Have you left?
I am on my way.
Don't lie.
I swear, I'm on my way.
Your promise has no value.
You made me wait last time...
If you are late, tell me. I will head home.
I'm tired from the bus journey.
I won't make you wait...
I am halfway there...
I will be there by the
time the film starts.
Ok.
Okay, don't drive like a maniac.
Ok, Bye.
Appa!
Appa!
Vasudev!
Sir?
There is a CCTV camera...
Have it checked.
- Ok, Sir!
- Quickly!
Please go back...
Let us do our work...
Why is there a delay?
Sir, there have been some
unforeseen circumstances…
It was supposed to be done tomorrow
but there is been a bit of a delay.
Preetam, you don't worry.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Go take a hot shower, you will feel better.
Don’t worry.
Prashanth, money is not a problem.
Preetham’s name shouldn't come out in this.
The CCTV footage has been captured.
Money won’t help now.
Kishore?! What's the point
of backing you during elections?
Can you please be quiet?
I will do what I can.
But it's not our time...
As you know, our party is under attack.
Swamy, check if Siddappa has come.
I’ll check, sir.
I don't know how you
will convince Siddappa.
I don't care how much you pay him.
Just convince him.
Sir, can I fix you another drink?
No
Sir...
It's hard to believe that
Siddappa caused this accident.
Then, what else can we do?
Will you get a better
opportunity than this?
15 lakhs!
Know how many years it
takes to earn that much?
This is just for 3 months…
Most importantly, you
earn the boss's trust.
What else do you need?
I don't know what to say, Anna.
You wanted to build a home by the sea.
I will think about it and tell you.
I will make sure you meet
with the boss directly.
I've got it painted as per your liking.
You're 3,000 rupees short...
But that's okay.
Pay the remaining amount
once the agreement is ready.
Thanks, I will pay the rest
within the 2nd of next month.
Ok.
- Treat this place as your home.
- Thank you Sir.
Take this.
Priya...
What?
Nothing.
What is it?
Pass the flowers.
What are you thinking?
Nothing...
Don't lie...
If I look into your eyes...
I feel like spending my
entire life in this moment.
Idiot!
Let’s go?
Another five minutes.
Come.
Sit down, Manu.
Sit down.
Prabhu must have briefed you.
What do you think?
Speak freely, don't worry.
How long would I need to be inside?
You know how the courts function...
About 6 months maybe.
If you are not interested,
let's not waste time.
Siddappa has been with me for 30 years...
He’ll go.
35 lakhs.
- Hey Manu...
- Prabhu!
We do not always get
what we want in life...
We have to negotiate.
How long did it take you to
get here from the gate?
I don’t understand, Anna.
3 minutes?
5 minutes?
It took me 30 years.
I will do anything to defend it.
If you stand by me today…
I’ll stand by you your entire life.
I’ll stand by you.
Swami, give him the advance.
Yes Sir.
This is 3 lakhs.
The balance, you’ll get
once the job is done.
- Come tomorrow at 10 AM.
- Ok, Anna.
What are you doing here?
What is that?
Keep it safe.
What happened?
Anna, I’ll be there in 10 minutes.
What happened?
Priya!
Priya!
How could you take this
decision without me?
Tell them you can't do it.
I will not agree to this.
I won't let you go.
Putti! I can't go back on my word now.
Its a matter of 3-4 months.
You will be done with college by then.
Why did you do this, Manu?
For our future Putti!
Have you lost your mind?
How is this good for our future?
Putti! Look here…
Look at me.
Don’t you want a tiny corner of
this world that we can call our own?
A place where we can live
out our lives together?
Don't you want that place?
But I already have that place.
Where?
Here, with you.
Manu, please?
Manu, don’t go..
Manu?
Manu, don’t go. Please...
Manu, if you leave...
- It’ll be the end of our…
- Priya!
I have to go!
- It’ll be ok.
- Manu, please...
Manu!
Manu!

They're a nuisance.
Take him inside..
Move aside!
Please understand.
We cannot reveal anything now.
We have just started the investigation.
Please allow us to do our job.
Don’t trouble us.
Priya?
I just switched it on.
Priya?
Okay, I won't watch it.
Priya...
What’s the point of skipping meals
and locking yourself up?
What are you doing?
He has no brains. Leave that for now.
Priya, open the door. Please.
Priya, open the door.
Sir?
Any visitors?
No. Nobody.
Caught in the midst of ceaseless...
Between many beginnings and ends...
“You stand alone...”
Please sir, can I make a phone call?
Priya?
“Fraught with the quest of essence”
“From dawn to dusk. Have you failed?”
“Coming closer, yet estranged.”
Write down your account of the accident.
“Will you come to me changed.”
Rubbish! Call his lawyers.
All good. Sign this.
“It is the turning point,”
“Will you go by as the dices roll?”
“Will you go by?”
“An inescapable mystique,”
Your Honour, we have serious reservation about
the applicability of Sec 307 in this case.
Sir, this falls under heinous crime.
- Ok.
- What Mr Prashant?
Your client's attention is elsewhere.
Is he demonstrating how he
caused the accident?
I am yet to receive
photos and video evidence.
We need time to review this.
This is a high profile case.
Submit the chargesheet.
Let's consider the bail later.
Take him into judicial custody.
Clear the crowd. Go quickly.
Move!
Priya?
“Call of the undying last breath”
“Calling quiet and discreet.”
You can take my words as a
warning or as advice.
You might be here for 14 days or 14 years.
But listen to me carefully.
Some of you are innocent and some, guilty.
The court will decide who
gets the white jail uniform.
But here, we are the ones
who are in charge.
If you behave well, so shall we.
If any of you acts smart...
We know how to deal with you.
Henceforth, this is your home.
If you fight with your
inmates and ruin our sleep…
We won’t check who is right or wrong...
These walls will see blood.
Follow the constable to
your respective barracks.
Hey!
All the new inmates sleep near the toilet.
None of you can use the toilet here.
If anyone needs to go,
hold it until morning.
Understood?
Hey b♪♪♪♪♪d. Shut the f♪♪♪ up!
You are disturbing our sleep!
What is your problem?
You were the one crying?
B♪♪♪♪♪d.
You want to cry? We’ll make you cry.
Please don’t hit me.
Come, Don't worry.
We won't do anything.
Where to Anna?
I have some work to do. Come.
Hey?
Do you have a light?
Where was he?
The Patil gang was eyeing him.
I picked him up before they could.
Did you give the medicine to Fayaz?
I forgot, Soma Anna.
I told you last night itself.
Go give it now.
What's your name?
Manu
Don't be scared to be in jail.
It's a place for transformation.
Our jailor says this is
a maternity hospital.
The ones who come here
experience rebirth...
So one must bear some
labour pain, isn't it?
There is no hurry.
You will understand as days go by.
Now go finish the job
you were hurrying up for.
Don’t worry, take your time.
Hey Rajani, listen to this poetry.
When the a♪♪ sings aloud,
the body feels proud!
So this is your story...
So you won't be here for long.
Better learn how things work here.
Neither is this a jungle to
hunt and survive.
Nor is it a community to
share and care.
If you want to live here peacefully...
You must know who to bow down to...
And who to pick fights with...
Come, I will give you a
tour of the jail.
Jail is not four walls. It’s this big wall.
Time works differently beyond that wall.
If you want to forget that,
you will need his help.
He is the aviation head of our jail.
On the other side of this gate...
Exists a mafia in the
name of reformation.
There is a big factory with lathe,
carpentry, printing, welding and handloom.
And that guy standing there
like a wild boar
His name is Patil.
He runs the show!
If he finds newcomers,
he’ll screw them.
Beware of him. Don't get in his way.
This is the very famous jail bakery.
They even send it to
the Legislative House...
From criminals to crooks...
Everything here is a coupon system now.
Do you need more proof that God exists?
It's been a week since
our last weed supply.
It used to be affordable.
Now prices have shot up.
Do you want?
You’ll get everything here.
You just need money.
Except these walls...
Everyone here asks for money...
Lakhs of rupees exchange hands here.
One share in that goes to the Tower.
'Dolly' is code for police...
If you pay money to the Tower,
life becomes easier.
Don't be surprised that there
are no policemen around.
It's the veterans that hold the reins.
If you hand a lathi to the beaten,
they won’t throw it away.
They will become police.
The country is made up of criminals,
by criminals, for criminals.
Sorry, not country, this jail.
This is it. The world
of the wayward people.
I'm not preaching. But I'll give you
some advice, don't mind.
The dreams you get in jail,
makes you hope.
Be careful.
Do you have any questions?
Where do we meet visitors?
Amma, I have already added them.
It's okay. He loves cashews and raisins.
Fine. I will get ready to leave.
After it cools, please put it in a box.
- Don't worry.
- You too.
- Bye.
- Come soon.
Sorry..
- Please sit down.
- It’s ok.
Where do I catch the bus to Central Jail?
This way, 2km ahead.
Please hurry up.
Why did you stop here?
This is the last for a public vehicle.
You have to walk it up from here.
Ramanna, let this girl through.
Token No 314... 314
Token 314!
Token 314!
Token 314
Have some patience!
Go one after the other.
How are you, idiot?
Battery was weak, now it's charged.
Are you eating properly?
Hey! Time's up!
I just got here.
That’s the time you get.
Manu!
Manu!
Did he like it?
Yes Amma, he liked it a lot.
I knew it.
I'll wash up the vessels.
You eat now.
Lunch was heavy. I'm not hungry yet.
I'll watch TV for a while and then eat.
You go give that and come.
Okay.
Manu?
I heard about the visiting room incident.
It made me sad.
The one with the lathi will
try to wield his power.
Like I said earlier,
everything is a business.
Do one thing...
There is a guy who rents out mobile phones.
Call your boss and inform him
that you will need some money.
How much will it cost?
I will give, you can return it later.
Aren’t you are one of us?
Also, I have spoken to the Dolly…
You shift into our barracks.
Hey Manu...
collect the phone at the last window.
Only one call.
Anna?
- I will talk to the Boss. Don’t worry.
- Ok Anna.
You're done.
Shankari wait.
You go ahead...
Thanks Anna.
Putti?
How are you? Are you hurt?
Nothing's happened. I am fine.
You don't worry.
I swear, this won't repeat.
- Just a few more days.
- Okay.
- For my sake, go eat now.
- Okay, I will.
You can smile, they say
it's good for health.
Idiot!
The Jailor is calling.
Why did this happen?
We're packed three times over
capacity with prisoners.
Also, we're short staffed.
That's the reason for this.
- Namaste Sir.
- Come Manu.
You talk. I will take leave.
Come.
Sit.
Sit down.
- How are you?
- I am fine.
It’s difficult to be fine in such a place.
I heard you had some
trouble the other day...
Don't worry it won't repeat.
- I hope no one else is troubling you.
- No
I have found a very helpful person.
Anna...
The bail?
Everything has been arranged.
I personally came to tell you that.
At the hearing, do as
Prashant tells you to.
Let us both honour our word.
Don’t worry.
Good.
I will be at peace when
you come out of here.
Next time, let us meet outside the jail.
Let's meet at the court.
I will find the ideal place
for you in Mangalore, to settle down.
Thanks Anna.
Case number CLP 58/010.
Summon the accused.
Are you aware of what
is on the charge-sheet?
Speak up loudly.
I am aware, your Honour.
On the 25th March 2010...
Were you driving the White Fortuner
license plate KA05AE4411?
I was.
Were you forced to confess this?
No.
Start the proceedings.
The judge is unpredictable.
Be careful.
Ensure all formalities
are sorted before the next date.
Don't worry, Prashant.
Sir, Manu came through.
There was no problems.
Follow instructions from Prashant...
Speak to the jailor...
- Make sure Manu is comfortable.
- Yes Sir.
Shall we open this?
How is your boss?
He is a nice gentleman.
A man of his word.
He’s tough on the outside,
but soft on the inside.
Very rare to find such men.
I have told him about you as well.
About me?
Next time when he is here,
I'll introduce you to him.
Go eat and sleep,
before those animals finish the food.
Ok Anna.
Hey Manu, Come sit…
Sir?
Sir? What happened?
Madam!
Madam!
He’s become very naughty.
He doesn’t listen one bit.
The other day, I caught
him writing a love letter.
He can spell words like Sweety & Beauty
Instead of answers, he writes
the questions multiple times.
Breaking news: Businessman Shankar
Gowda critical, say doctors

Priya...
We are next.
Sorry…
How did the show go?
Was the music director there?
It went well.
Putti, why do you look dull?
What happened?
Putti?
Nothing.
Is Amma ok? Vinod?
They are fine.
Why do you look upset?
Putti...
We have limited time. Please.
Did something happen at the show...
Shankre Gowda passed away.
Its been two days...
Are you joking?
What happened?
Heart attack.
Manu?
Say something...
Manu?
I’m sad that this happened.
He was a good man.
Look at me...
Don’t worry Manu.
Manu?
I’ll take care.
Nothing will happen to you.
What has happened, can't be changed...
Anna is a man of his word.
It’ll be ok.
Did you speak to Prabhu?
I tried....he didn't take my call.
He must be busy with the funeral.
- He’ll call back.
- Okay.
Putti!
You don't worry
Everything will go as planned.
Ok? Everything will be ok, promise.
If I see a smile on that face,
It will help me recharge my batteries.
I'll meet you at court. Bye.
Anna, it's your turn. Play this pawn.
Manu?
Why are you sulking?
Come and join us.
Anna, play.
The toilets are stinking..
Yes, the stench is too much.
What are you doing here instead
of cleaning the toilet?
Will your wife clean it?
Today is Wednesday. It's Mahesh's turn
Is it yours?
My turn was yesterday
Not me, Its Kali’s turn.
Not mine. It's his.
No, his.
Not mine.
Shut the f♪♪k up!
Manu?
Why so glum?
Talk to me.
Come let’s talk outside.
What happened?
Now that your boss is
dead, what use are you?
Shall we strip Draupadi of her saree?
Get him to clean all the
toilets in the barracks from now.
Sir?
Go, Go.
The b♪♪♪♪♪d died before I could
even shape my dream.
God tempted with an opportunity
and took it away from me.
Hey, enough!
Cant take it out on God. So...
Hey! Clean properly.
Not a single stain. It should shine.
Everybody, put your clothes here.
I’ll make you rewash if
there is a single stain.
Anna?
Anna... Visiting room?
Do you not get the rules here?
There is a price for everything here.
Either pay up or slog.
You know how many toilets have to be
cleaned for the visiting room access?
- Putti...
- What happened?
- Nothing...
- Manu?
Nothing much. I tripped while coming.
Don't lie.
It's true. How are you?
- Who hit you Manu?
- Nobody...
Manu?
What happened Manu?
I swear I tripped...
Come dear.
Please come in.
Uncle, what happened to Manu's bail?
Shankre Gowda has given his word.
I will speak to madam.
Don't worry at all...
I will ensure Manu's safety, okay?
I am late for work. I’ll take my leave.
What is this nonsense?!
I’ve kept the house vacant all this while.
Now, I’ve to suffer the loss.
Useless people!
Bro, lets look for some new boys today!
The last time was not fun.
Hey you, get up.
Get up and come.
- It wont hurt!
- Come. Get up.
Manu Anna help me!!
Come, don’t fuss so much.
I beg you...
Please don’t do this...
Kill me but don't do this...
No! Please! I beg of you....
Ok Madam, I will take care.
You don't worry. Show her out.
Please come Madam.
I have assured you. I will take care.
Come, I’ll take you to another barrack.
Not bad Manu, you have enough money
to change your barrack.
Manja, you bloody chameleon,
You change as per the wind.
You're acting too smart.
Shut your gob and go to bed.
You want me to reduce your commission?
[Sings a romantic song]
I love you, Manu!
Go there. Sit comfortably.
Aye you, make way!
Listen!
Nobody troubles this boy.
Be warned!
- Suicide Sir.
- Get the body out
- Stand back.
- Make way.
Get the ladder. Move back...
- What are you looking at?
- Move back
Move back...
- Can you call Madam for a minute?
- Yes, sir.
Take care Madam.
Madam, Prashanth sir wants a word.
Excuse me.
Madam, the date for the driver's
bail hearing is approaching.
The Boss had directed me
to arrange for the bail.
We need to keep his word.
Please keep up his commitment.
Excuse me...
Madam... I'd like to say something.
Yes?
The Boss's word goes with him to the grave.
Don't attach value to it.
If Manu comes out,
it might be a problem for Preetham.
Preetham has to look after the business.
Why invite any kind of trouble?
Speak to Prashant about it.
But Swamy said the Boss’s promise....
You handle these things from now on.
Swamy, did the lawyer leave?
Yes, he left.
There's another job to attend to.
The stables have to be cleaned.
Better carry a handkerchief.
Is this a joke?
He is a senior advocate,
doesn't he have any sense?
What a waste of the court's time!
Case adjourned.
Sorry sir.
Madam, where is Prashanth sir? Madam?
Prashanth Sir?
Priya...
Manu!
Putti!
Everything will be fine...
- Don’t get tensed.
- Don't be scared.
Putti!
Did your girlfriend give you the letter?
Manu?
Manu! Tell her to give me a letter.
It's delicious!
- Is she delicious to look at as well?
- Hey, turn the other way. Turn!
Why are you looking at me?
Did you feel bad?
Manu, we can share. No problem.
- I am hungry, understand my plight.
- Shut up!
Manu!
Manu!
Hey, Manu!
I can taste the lipstick!
Did she send kisses in the letter?
If you have the b♪♪♪s,
come to our barrack!
If you don't intend to get
out of jail, then go...
Go, fight with him.
Namaste Sir.
Who's she?
Sir, from the Shankre Gowda case...
She's related to the driver
Don't entertain her.
Okay Sir.
Can I join?
Can I join?
Your timing's good!
We've just got three new machines.
Hey, aren't you from Soma's gang?
No!
Venky!
- Anna, that B♪♪♪♪♪♪ is...
- Quiet down.
What's your name?
Manu
What's your crime?
I haven't committed any crime.
Another innocent soul in the house!
Prakash: Robbery case...
Gaali: Kidnapping case...
Venky: Dacoity and murder...
- Pandu..
- Murder
- Petro..
- Half murder
There are no worthy or
unworthy people here.
And definitely none who are innocent.
Even Lord Rama made mistakes.
If we want to change, then we need
to accept our mistakes, right?
I am asking you again.
What crime did you commit to be here?
I am not lying...
I haven't committed any crime.
Keep those three power looms idle.
Sir!
Sir!
I wanted to meet Madam.
She is not here.
She left to America with Preetham sir.
Namaste sir.
Didn’t I tell you not to entertain her...
Get rid of her.
How many times to tell you!
Prabhu asked us to drop the case.
Its what the family wants and
they are our clients.
We are bound to their decision.
It's better you find another lawyer.
I am sorry.
What's with you?
Are you waiting for the
answers to appear on the wall?
Hello?
Oh No!
Who did this?
Which b*****d?
Hello Sir? A rock fell on
the car from somewhere!
Give me the case file.
This boy has confessed
to have driven the car.
It'll be difficult to create
another narrative and fight.
But I'll try.
Thank you Sir.
Here is Rs 25,000.
The chargesheet states the
CCTV footage as evidence.
It has just been submitted to the court.
Please pay attention.
- You can play it now.
- Okay Sir.
Your honour, the accident
victim's daughter is present.
She had witnessed the accident.
If you give us permission,
then we can take her statement.
Yes! Call her.
Did you see who was driving the car?
No Sir.
That's all Sir.
- I just tired of asking for justice Sir.
- You may leave the stand...
He said he was driving...
- Now he’s saying he didn’t...
- Sir, there is no connection to this case...
If this goes on...
- He’ll say my father was not killed.
- Please Leave.
This is court wont let that happen.
Don't worry. Those at fault
will be severely punished.
Anna?
Can I join?
When I was outside...
I couldn’t get the stench
of sweat out of my collar.
I was desperate to get rid of it. So...
I'm sorry Anna.
Don't worry.
In jail, the uniform
doesn’t have any collars.
Only stains of blood.
Hit and run case.
Dye this in your favourite colour...
And come to the threading floor.
Every thread here...
Struggles and fights with another thread...
If there is a slight shift
in the force we apply...
The cloth will reflect our mistakes.
It can't be set right.
Life is similar, isn't it Manu?
It's in our nature to make mistakes...
But if we don’t learn
from those mistakes...
The cloth is ruined forever.
How you spend your time in here...
Is in your hands.
We aren't born as humans...
We have to become human.
Think about it.
Work starts at 9 A.M.
You get a half hour lunch break...
If you do well, there'll be a bonus.
Take this...
"The illusion, of a half shadow"
"Fight! Fight!"
"The quest is on till
there's nothing more."
"An endless search for a faraway shore,"
"Fight! Fight!"
"There's distress in
each and every breath."
"An endless game this, of life and death"
"Living a life uncertain"
"Seemingly calm, stepping on fire"
"Tearing apart habits of before"
"At the crossroads once more"
"Fight! This life in the cage"
"Fight!! Persistent screams
of the silent bird,"
"The blue sky seems far and blurred"
"Wings of the bird ripped apart
The desire to fly, ever in the heart."
Break!
Go take a count of everybody.
It makes me so happy to see your girl!
Hey, don't misunderstand me...
Then how do I interpret it?
That girl is like my sister.
Her name is Priya.
My wife also visits once in two weeks...
Poor thing!
It's been two years since I got here.
She must have missed visiting me
about 6-7 times.
But there's a lot of difference
between my wife and your girl.
What difference?
Its an obligation for my wife to see me.
If she doesn’t, my
relatives only get nasty.
Why will society spare her from judgement?
Once visiting hours finish...
She is so relieved to get out,
she doesn't look back once...
I have been waiting all this while to see
if she’ll look back once.
But your girl, Priya isn't like that.
She’s reluctant to leave you behind
in this horrible place.
Like they say...
You see true love only
through a woman’s eyes.
"Money and a roof over the head
It's only pressure and dread"
"Like an empty feeling all around.
All alone in this twisted town"
"Happiness is unseen, so is the smile"
"Bowing too often has broken the back"
"The sky is moving and slipping away"
"The reality of solitude is here to stay,"
"Despair awaits, staring in the face,
"Time stands still,
even the shadow's left without a trace"
"In the whispers of the night"
"Caught in the vortex of pain,"
"Unable to recall what's most right"
"Chased and trampled, knocked out cold"
"Yet appears the dream of freedom"
"Life's a file with no pages left"
"Life's a game with a losing bet"
"Life's riches, lost and bereft"
"Muck and grime all around"
"Yet here I am, firm on the ground."
What’s up manu!
Spending too many nights with Patil?!
Let go Patil, you are getting old.
Amma, I’m leaving
There is one lakh in this
Going forward,
We’ll be needing more money than this...
Going forward,
We’ll be needing more money than this...
What sir?
Do you also want one?
Don't act over smart.
Do you want to get it?
Then, leave my hand sir.
I wont go anywhere...
At least, handcuff me.
We can't use handcuffs in court.
I am doing you a favour by
letting her sit next to you.
Idiot! Cant you keep quiet?
It’s so difficult to not see you smile...
Don’t start with your dialogues..
No, I’m not serious...
Sometimes it gets difficult to breathe.
I miss you hopelessly.
In our weaving floor...
There is a tape recorder
just like the one at home.
When they play songs on it...
I so badly want to hear you sing!
Once you come out,
I’ll sing until your eardrum explodes
Ok?
I wonder if I will ever get out...
Idiot! All nonsense.
Don't get me angry now!
Sorry.
Leave it...
Look here...
Everything will be alright!
Ok?
This man is a good lawyer...
We shouldn’t give up our fight.
Ok?
You can smile...
They say it's good for your health.
Come, we are next.
Let’s go
It’ll take another month sir.
Get it quickly...
Case adjourned.
Ok sir.
If this continues, your next date
will be after four months.
Let’s move
Priya...
Lawyer has asked me to come,
I might be late...
How long will you go on like this?
How can we lie to ourselves
that things will get better?
I know what loneliness does to a person...
After your father passed..
Why didn't you remarry after his death?
Why didn’t you remarry?
And you've come her to give me sermons!
There's no two ways about this...
No matter how long it takes,
I will wait for him!
Ok.
Go safely...
If you'll be late, take the keys.
Hello...
Manu’s room has to be vacated.
Come and collect his stuff.
Putti...
Tea ready.
Anything else sir...
Nothing else.
Priya has sent you clothes.
I’ll collect it...
And...
She asked me to pass this on...
Is there anything else?
Nothing else.
Come forward...
Give me your bag.
Are you smuggling anything in?
He’s clear sir.
Send him.
Unde, Manu just shifted to the other line.
Get going.
Why did you change the line?
What’s there in the bag?
There is nothing in here.
Did you check his pockets?
I have checked. Nothing.
If there is nothing, send him.
Get going.
Gali, where is the tape recorder?
I’m excited to announce
the next performers are....
My friends, our very
own Akashavani group...
Will perform a song!
I request all to welcome them
with a very big round of applause.
Give the cassette.
Sir, please forward 10 seconds...
Yes that's it.
Idiot!
From the moment
I got the idea of making a tape for you.
I was wondering how to say
all that I want to say in just 90 mins.
But, I don’t know where to start!
It's been long since you laughed.
So let me start off with a joke...
An elephant is bathing in a lake...
An ant comes and asks the
elephant to come out.
So the elephant comes out...
He asks the ant...
"Why did you ask me to come out?"
The ant replies, "I wanted to check
if you are wearing my underwear!"
I know how badly you
want to hear me sing...
I'll try.
“The gentle breeze”
“sings a lilting tune”
“Adorned by”
“sweet nothings”
“Beyond the blue skies...”
I'm unable to sing without you, Manu.
I have a sore throat.
That's all for today.
Before you became my idiot,
I used to sing for myself.
I don't know when that changed.
Now I feel like singing for you.
I am waiting for you to
return from jail, Manu.
I shall sing for you every day.
I know you're very scared.
I am also scared.
I can't sleep.
I get lost worrying endlessly.
Whenever that happens...
I seek comfort by fast forwarding our life.
Whenever you come out...
Be it this year or the next...
It could be 5 years or 10 years...
This life with me will await you!
Our little home...
Do you know what
the house will be like?
Just like the one that
we had paid the deposit for.
A big window in the living room...
Idiot!
I had such a beautiful
dream the other day, you know?
There was a loud noise and I woke up.
I tried so hard,
but couldn’t go back to that dream.
The sea close to my hometown...
I’ve taken you there...
There is absolutely nobody around us...
Its just me and you on the entire beach...
We are walking right next to the sea...
I tried so hard,
but couldn’t go back to that dream.
The sea close to my hometown...
I’ve taken you there...
Its just me and you on the entire beach...
We are walking right next to the sea...
The waves wiped away
our footprints behind us.
I am holding onto your hand tightly...
We were so very happy!
Even now, if I close my eyes...
I can hear the sound of waves...
Can you also hear it?
She sings so well, isn’t it?
Manu
Manu
She may not be confined to four walls.
But she also is in a prison of sorts.
Music...
She has stopped singing.
There is no space for music in her life.
Even I want both of you to get married.
But we don’t know when you will get out...
How long can you let her go on like this?
- Hit the kill switch.
- Call for the doctor.
Go get the first aid box...
The wound is deep.
Don't remove your bandage.
Be careful.
Hello... I see...
I will be there in a minute.
Aren't you done yet?
Get going, time’s up.
- Leaving Sir.
- Hurry up.
Forgot that, leave.
Ok. Ok.
He always does this...
Stop...
Check properly.
Why are you late today?
I was let in late, so...
Same excuse every day.
All clear sir...
Open the gates.
- Go, don’t be late tomorrow.
- Ok sir.
Leave, leave.
Alert! Prisoner escape!
Code Red! Code Red!
Stop!
Stop the vehicle!
Back up! Back up!
Back up into the compound.
Back up into the compound.
Quickly! Back up!
Go back!
Close the gates.
I’m at gate four. I’ll update you.
Water tanker checking sir. Over.
Solitary confinement
will teach you a lesson.
You try to escape my prison...
I’ll see how you get bail now!
Rot here you b♪♪♪♪♪♪.
Badge 314... Badge 314...
Putti...
I don’t have the courage
to tell you this in person.
By the time this letter reaches you...
We would’ve met for the last time.
I chased a foolish dream...
And took a terrible decision.
The decision that I am about to take now...
Might seem worse than the first one.
I’m choosing to do this...
Because I love you.
This idiot has troubled you enough!
I know this will hurt you a lot...
Some day if you can, forgive me.
You’ve waited long enough for me...
Its time you start a new life...
I know how much joy singing brings to you.
You have to become a famous singer!
I hope your new life is much better
than the one we dreamt of together.
Don’t worry about me...
You have given me your dream.
As long as I live...
I will rewind and listen to it endlessly.
Your eyes...
The love for me in your eyes...
I want to see them one last time...
And remember it forever.
I’ve to charge my batteries
to last my lifetime.
What is it?
Nothing.
Idiot, were you listening to what I said?
I got lost in your eyes for a bit...
Idiot!
Time’s up! Leave!
I’ll see you at court.
Putti!
You are singing, right?
Yes...
Don't ever stop singing.
Okay.
Putti...
Even you know it.
At court, our’s is a losing fight...
Don’t waste anymore money...
Please thank our lawyer for me...
This punishment is mine alone.
“Can I behold you?”
“Once more?”
“Will you hear me?”
“Like before”
“The silence”
“The wariness”
“Why?”
“Oh Why?”
“So needless...”
“This distance”
“Why?”
“Oh Why?”
“You are an enchanted wood”
“And me a song that beckons”
“Encased there... is this soul”
Manu, she's been waiting for you...
Why are you doing this?
I'm extremely hungry!
You’re always hungry!
Anna
What crime did you commit?
For my crime...
There is only a sentence...
But no forgiveness.
Come let's eat.
I am very tired amma...
I didn’t ask for any of this...
Whatever I do,
I cant seem to escape from this pain.
What do I do?
Grief is like a mountain, Priya...
It'll be there all your life.
But you must cross and get past it.
To this day, when I close my eyes...
I see your father...
It hurts a lot...
But I am thankful for all the good memories
that he gave me.
You'll get used to it.
You must learn to get used to it.
The pain will always remain.
There's no escaping it, Priya.
Token 314.
Token 314.
“Unable to picture you anymore!”
“Only the broken sky for succour”
“When the dream escapes”
“World is but a cage”
“A diary of emptiness”
“Why?”
“Oh Why?”
You’re drawing?
You’re drawing!
How many times do I tell you...
Finish your homework.
Why are you hitting me? You're mad!
Vinod!
“You are an enchanted wood”
Vinod!
“And me a song that beckons”
“Encased there... is this soul”
“You are an enchanted wood”
“And me a song that beckons”
“Encased there... is this soul”
The court lawyer has failed
to establish innocence...
Having examined the case thoroughly...
The prosecution has proved the
charges against the accused.
I conclude that the accused is guilty.
I order 10 years rigorous punishment.
I won’t force you Priya.
But the proposal seems good.
I too am getting old.
Think about your brother too.
Think about it
We like the girl...
What do you think dear?
I’m okay with him.
Manu...
Look how well the tape recorder plays!
Guys, play a song for Manu.
Welcome song post verdict...
Just for you...
Did you wash it properly, Kali.
Music should be heard loud and clear!
Time's up. Leave... everyone leave.
Leave it...
Love you too, Manu.
What is it?
Soma’s guys had come to the factory.
They took all the cassettes with them...
I had hidden this from them.
Thanks!
Why, what happened?
You can use this card to call your home
Once a week for 5 minutes.
If anyone wishes to speak for longer...
Work hard in the factory
to recharge the card.
- Hello...
- Hey Vinod.
Manu anna!
How are you?
I’m good...
- You
- Is your sister home?
Amma and Akka have stepped out.
When will she come?
Actually...
The thing is...
Sister's wedding has been fixed.
Hello..
Am I audible?
Manu anna?
When?
On the 27th of this month.
Can you promise me something?
Yes
Don't tell her that I had called.
Vinod?
Okay.
I promise. I wont tell her.
What?
There was a phone call...
There was a phone call...
Who called?
"Beyond the sea..."
"I paused to see..."
"From as far as I can be..."
"You as Me."
"The burning flame..."
"From a spark it came..."
"This fire will not be tamed."
"As the breath singes..."
"A sigh is just a memory..."
"As our dreams parted midway..."
"The end has reached a finale."
"The dense dark clouds hang around!"
"Gazing down with a cruel look..."
"The meaningless sorrow,
Is lamenting around."
"The burning pain..."
"The heart's to blame..."
"There's no escape from this abyss..”
"As the breathe singes ..."
"A sigh is just a memory..."
"As our dreams parted midway..."
"The end has reached a finale."
The other day,
you asked me what my crime was...
My wife...
The sound of her skin
burning in the fire...
I can still hear it.
Being locked in prison,
isn't the punishment, Manu.
Living with our guilt
is the real punishment.
Dying is easy...
Living is difficult.
You're not safe here...
I’ve had a word with the jailer.
He's agreed to shift you
to the jail in Shimoga.
Idiot!
I hopelessly and endlessly miss you!
What I miss most....
Are the little moments we shared.
Every day, I think about the
moment you'll step out of jail, Manu.
I will be waiting for you outside the gate.
If I cry when I see you...
It's your responsibility to make me smile.
Idiot!
I had such a beautiful
dream the other day, you know?
I tried so hard,
but couldn’t go back to that dream.
Hello?
Hello?
Who is it?
