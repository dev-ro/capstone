Ms. Lichenstein, get out of here

I didn't bring her here.
Well, why the fuck did she ring my buzzer?
I can't hear you, Precious.
Since you got
so much motherfucking mouth,
and you gonna bring a bitch up
in my house,
why would that bitch ring
my goddamn buzzer?
I didn't tell her to come here.

I should've fucked you up,
but i let you walk away,

motherfucking day standing,
I promise you that.
You gonna send a white bitch
to my motherfucking buzzer?
Talking about some higher education?
You're a dummy, bitch,
you will never know shit.
Don't nobody want you.
Don't nobody need you.
You done fucked around
and fucked my motherfucking man
and had two motherfucking children,
and one of them is a goddamn animal,
running around,
looking crazy as a motherfucker.
Bitch, you know what?
See, I think you. . . I think you're trying me.
I think you're really trying to fuck with me.
You're fucking with my money.
And you're gonna stand up there
and look down at me

You said we was gonna play.
That's exactly why

I'm looking for an alternative school.
This is an alternative.
What alternative is?
What exactly are you asking me?
Lady at my other school

An alternative sohool, it's like a choice.
It's a different way of doing things.
So, i need your discharge papers
saying that they discharged you.
I got kicked out of school
'cause i was pregnant.
Well, i still need your discharge papers,
otherwise we can't let you in.
Ms. Lichenstein didn't say all that.

They already sent over
your discharge papers and stuff.
I could start today?
Yeah. 
Are you currently receiving AFDC?

So your mother has custody of you and
your daughter, and you're on her budget?
Okay, well, I'm gonna need a copy
of your mother's budget,
and a copy of your phone bill
and your utility bill.
We gotta give you a few tests,
test your reading and your math level,
see where to place you.
Hold on, baby. 
Each One Teach One, hold.
To enter into the GED classes,
you gotta get an 8.0 or better on the TABE.
There's always something wrong
with these tests.
These tests paint a picture of me
with no brain.
These tests paint a picture
of me and my mother,
my whole family, 
as less than dumb.
Just ugly, black grease to be wiped away,
find another job for.
Sometimes i wish, i was dead.
I'll be okay, i guess, 
'cause I'm looking up.
I'm looking up for a piano to fall.
Or a desk, couch, TV. . . Momma, maybe.
Always something in my way.
Yeah, man.
Yo, make sure you get that
for me, too, man.
Alternative.
Man, you gotta stop smoking
them shits, man.
That ain't the only thing
that's gonna fucking kill you.
Hustling in these streets gonna kill you.
It is what it is.
Then my mind come back down to Earth.
Let me get some of 
that sweet ass, orca!
What up, mama?
Why boys always 
grabbing on themselves?
You heard what the fuck I said?
I said give me some fucking ass.

When you gonna let me hit that?
That bitch is laughing. . .
I wish they'd leave me alone.

Yo, that's not even funny.
That's what she'd get anyway, no.
Precious!
Ma, i need some money!
Ma, I'm hungry!
Come take care of Mommy, Precious.
I wish she'd stop this shit.
The other day i cried.
I felt stupid. 
But you know what?
Fuck that day.
That's why God, or whoever,
makes new days.
Still hungry, though.
Nigger wants me to leave my kids.

- I heard you just say. . .
- You didn't hear shit.
- I heard you say your father. . .
- I ain't say nothing. I ain't say shit like it.
- I don't care, honey.
- I didn't say nothing like that.
- I need to know this.
- Let's move on.
I need to know this to help you.
- Bitch, can we change the subject?
- Okay.
Well, I'll see you next time, then.
Or maybe you'll see someone else.
But you're gonna have to talk to somebody
if you want your check, sweetie.
I see vampires, too.
They come at night.
They tell me I'm one of them.
They say, ''Precious, you belong with us.''
And then they go downstairs
through the floor.
The people that live under us,
they is vampires,
so that's where they should go.
They be so nasty, though,
leaving their dirty tampons and shit
in the garbage.
Don't even offer to take it out.
They got no fucking home training.
I been going to the doctor, too. 
It's nice.
Ms. Rain fall out when she Found out
I ain't never been to no doctor before.
Don't know how i had my first baby
on the kitchen floor
with my momma kicking me
upside my head .
Them the kind of things
you're talking about
when you say,
say whatever come to my mind?
That's the end of them welfare checks.
I just couldn't lie no more.
I shouldn't have said none of that.
Momma gonna kill me.
Motherfuckers!
Are we done?
I'm not doing this with you today.
At night, we went out on a field trip.
These girls is crazy.
Ain't nobody ever grabbed my hand
like that before.
...as a candidate
for the Democratic nomination
for the presidency
of the United States of America.
...and by having destroyed it,
now we don't know. . .
...and the testimony you're about to give
will be the truth, the whole truth. . .
I still have a dream.
It is a dream deeply rooted
in the American dream.
I have a dream that one day
this nation will rise up
and live out the true meaning of. . .
I'm gonna teach my baby all of this.
''We hold these truths to be self- evident,
''that all men are created equal. ''
No fear. That's bullshit. That's bullshit.
You mean , write a whole new one?
No, girl , if i need to explain myself to you. . .
- You'll figure it out.
- You think that I'm stupid?
Oh , my God . That I believe in you?
That i think you're incredible?
Yes, but i don't know what to do.
All right, pull it together. Okay.
Who's next?
I'm happy to be writing.
- Go ahead , Rhonda.
- I'm happy to be in school, too.
Ms. Rain say we gonna write
every day in our notebook.
She gonna write back to us every day, too.
''Yesterday I went to church for
the first time since I come to this country.
''I got all the way to Brooklyn.
''The church was up the block and around
the corner upon the 3 train .
''The preacher preached
two and a half hours
- ''about Jehovah .
- Rhonda ! Rhonda!
''And how Lord Jesus, Son of God, Messiah,
Jehovah delivers.''
Is that a fairytale?
Sit down.
Did anybody do this assign ment?
Momma say this school ain't shit.
She say you can't learn nothing
writing in no book.
- This is a fairytale called ''Enchanted.''
- She wrong about that. I is learning.
''Once upon a time, in a faraway land,
''there lived a beautiful princess
named Joan n- a.
''She was very, very fly and extra, extra tall,
''and every single boy loved her,
big and small .
''Except for one idiot boy
who was so stupid and dumb.
''And out of all the cute boys who loved her,
he was the cutest one.''
- That's all I got so far.
- That's a good beginning.
Thinking about little Mongo, too. 
I miss her.
That's how you start a fairytale.
I'm happy my baby coming up.
I'm gonna read to this baby, too,
and hang colors on its wall.
Listen, baby. Mother not dumb.
Mother love you. Listen.
''Once upon a time,
there was a magical princess
''who lived in a magical bubble
under the sea.
''And she was from land.''
Stop screaming.
His name's Abdul Jamal Lewis Jones.
He healthy. 
His mother love him.
The food in this hospital's nasty.
It's not from here.
Where it from?
A little shop by my house where
I get my organic food ,
so i don't have to eat that
nasty mystery- meat stuff
they got downstairs.
Can you bring me something?
I don't like fruit. I like McDonald's.
First of all , 
I don't eat McDonald's.
Second of all, you don't need
to be eating McDonald's, either.
It's not healthy.
But I like McDonald's.
We all like McDonald's, right?
We like McDonald's, too, over here.
I don't like no damn McDonald's.
I want some of that organio shit
like you got.
Well , I tell you what,
when you get up out of here,
you go with all your little friends,
and you go to McDonald's,
and you get as much
McDonald's as you want.
But right now,
you're gonna take care of your health.
Are you a doctor?
- Are you her doctor?
- Am i a doctor?
- Yeah .
- i am a nurse's aide.
Nurse John- John.
Oh , that's funny?
Well, you're a man.
- You've never seen a male nurse?
- No.
Not looking like you do.
I am a male nurse.
i am Nurse John McFadden.
So was you up in the room
when she popped the baby out?
You was like, all up in between her. . .
Joan, don't be nasty!
How was it? Was he screaming?
It hurt.
Tough gal like you had to scream?
Not so tough with a baby coming out of me.
It hurt. And it burned.
- Are you married?
- Shut up!
You got a girlfriend?
- Why you asking? He don't want you.
- How would you know?
Why don't you stop being a ho
for 1 0 minutes?
What's wrong with these people?
You don't want her, right?
I wish i was a cantaloupe in that cup.
So he could eat you?
Okay, no. 
I gotta go. I gotta go.
No, that's all right. That's all right.
Can i get a kiss, too, Nurse John?
- Good afternoon , ladies.
- Bye, Nurse John.
- Bye !
- Good night, Nurse John- John !
Precious and John- John
Sitting in a tree
- F- U- C- K- I- N- G
- Shut up! Y'all are nasty.
You think he's spending the night
up in here?
Now she gonna write
about Nurse John in her book!
''Dear Ms. Rain,
''All the years I sit in class, 
I never learned.
''Now I got a baby again by my father.
''I wish I had a boyfriend like other girls.
''Then I'll feel right
that i have to quit school.
''I love my baby, 
but i want school, too.
" Social worker ask me
if i wanna give little Mongo
''and Abdul up for adoption.
I could kill her.
'"She never helped before.
Now she wanna take my kids away?
''lf she takes Abdul,
l won't have nothing no more. ''
''Dear Precious,
''I think your first responsibility
has to be to yourself.
''If you keep Abdul, 
you might have nothing.
''You're learning to read and write.
That's everything.
''You come back to school
when you get out of the hospital.
''You're only 17. ''
This looks like a big- ass condom.
Use that for Nurse John.
Not looking like that.
Your hair looks a mess.
- I'm giving you banjee.
- Shut up!
I got your journal.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Are you sure?
Yeah , I'm sure.
All right. I'm bored. 
I'm about to leave. Bye.
Bye, Ms. Toosie.
You got a nasty- ass mouth.
You got a nasty- ass hat.
That's what's wrong ,
you hanging out with bitches like that.
Here's your baby.
It's probably the last time
you're gonna ever see him.
Grandmother come and visit and say,
''Only a dog would drop a baby
and walk off. ''
Not even a dog.
Say later, '"Not even a dog. "
I'm proud of you .
Ain't nothing like your mother.
''Where was your grandmother
when your father was abusing you?
''Where is little Mongo now?
''What is going to be the best thing for you
in this situation?"
''Ms. Rain, you ask too many questions.
''Sometimes I wish i could stop breathing.
''I just wanna be a good mother. ''
''Being a good mother might mean
letting Abdul be raised
''by someone who's better able than you
to meet his needs. "
''Ms. Rain, I is the best
to meet my child's needs. ''
''Who's gonna help you?
''How will you support yourself?
''How will you keep learning
to read and write?'"
''The welfare helped Momma. ''
''You look and see
how much welfare has helped your mom.
''You could get your GED,
''and go to college.
You can do anything, Precious. ''
You back?
What's his name?
Can i hold it?
Hey, Precious.
Hey.
You had the baby?
A boy.
Where you been all this time?
Let me see him.
Can i hold him?
He look like his daddy.
He named Abdul.
put all this shit down
and go get me something to drink.
You bitch !
- You fucking bitch!
- You crazy, Momma?
Am i crazy? 
Bitch , if i was to. . .
You ruined my fucking life!
You done took my man ,
you had those fucking babies,
and you got me put off the welfare
for running your goddamned
stupid-ass mouth!
I ain't stupid and i didn't take your man.
Your husband raped me!
Didn't no-fucking-body rape you!
Bitch, don't you put
your fucking hands on me!
Mary, leave that girl alone!
Can i see the baby now?
B. . . C. . . D. . .
E. . . F. . . G . . . H. . .
l . . . J . . . K. . .
I'm tired of shopping.
Yes, because they all trying
to take your money.
They don't. . .
I'm calling the cops.
Tell me what you see back there.
I could tell by Ms. Rain's face
I ain't gonna be homeless no more.
I just don't know
where I'm gonna end up, though.
I'll hold.
I feel bad for her.
She just an ABC teacher.
She ain't no social worker.
What's going on?
But she all i could think of.
Look, when the others get here,
tell them to start writing .
And whichever one of you is older
is in charge, okay?
Consuelo, I know that's not you.
Come here.
Ms. Rain , I can't stay. I'm serious.
I've tried to talk. . .
Consuelo, you're not leaving class
and I'm not dealing with this right now.
Take this money.
Go get something for Precious to wear.
Quick. And bring back my change.
Sixteen years old. 
A three-day-old infant.
The baby not bleeding.
I think this is Precious' blood.
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?
We'll find you a place to live.
Joann , you're late.
Rhonda, you ain't the teacher.
Joann, Ms. Rain is busy
with Precious today,
so i am the teacher today.
Okay. Why?
- Where's Preoious?
- Just sit. Pull out your notebook.
Joann, you wanna say one of your raps
to the baby?
What's the baby doing here?
- Joann's gonna rap for you.
- Let me see.
She all right. 
She's doing good.
Why is the baby wrapped up
in a blood-covered blanket?
- Joann, what's so funny?
- For real. What happened?
You don't wanna know is
how it got on the blanket.
You know what your problem is, Joann?
That you can't take anything
serious enough.
- Jermaine, me expect better from you.
- Okay, Rhonda.
Joann, stop laughing at this baby.
Queens.
Let me call you back.
Just tell me what happened!
No, it's not funny.
But Joann, there's nothing funny
about a baby with blood on it.
I got a West indian friend
who's a Council member.
Let me see what she can do.
Hold on a second.
I found a lesson plan in our notebooks.
We're gonna. . .
Claireece Jones.
Hey, Ms. Lisa. 
How you been?
I don't know.
I went to see that movie, Barfly, last night.
piece of shit.
- I'm sorry.
- It's on my desk. Can you hold?
Something's wrong with you, Precious.
This baby stink.
Well, we don't have a pamper,
so have a seat with the baby.
- I am sitting.
- In your seat, please.
The first thing
is shut the bumba-ros-clot. . .
Ms. Rain , why did you let Rhonda
teach the class?
She don't even know how to speak English.
Let Rhonda take over.
- Shut the bumba-ros-clot up.
- What the fuck is a ''ros clot''?
Yeah, Brenda, you there?
The last four of the Social are. . .
2- 4- 2- 1 .
- Rita?
- I just wanna know how to spell ''Aquarius.''
- Anybody know how to spell ''Aquarius''?
- It's A- Q- U- A- R- l- U- S.
Can you spell ''boy'' then?
Can you spell ''slut'' then?
Let's explore that.
You wanna spell ''slut,'' Consuelo,
I'll give you the first letter.
Can you spell ''illegal immigrant,'' then?
Great, thank you.
Can you please use ''slut'' in a sentence?
Consuelo is a slut. . .
- You the one who's the ho up in here. . .
- Joann is not a slut.
perfect. You get a gold star.
But you know she likes that.
Well, she's just insecure.
- You think?
- Yeah.
- That chicken was good.
- Really good. Did you have enough?
There ain't more, is there?
- Is there more?
- Yeah.
Maybe later. Not now.
I don't want you to think I'm greedy.
You're not greedy.
If you're hungry, let's get you some more.
I guess i kind of eat
too much sometimes, though.
No, you don't.
- Blu, is that you?
- Not always.
What are you doing here?
I live here. 
Why didn't you tell me?
- Hey, sweetie.
- Is this. . . Is this. . .
This is Katherine, Precious.
- Are you okay?
- It's so nice to meet you , finally.
Oh, my God. 
These straight-up lesbians.
- This is Abdul.
- He's gorgeous. He looks just like you.
Precious, can i hold him?
You know how to?
They stilinlce enough
to let us stay in their home
until i get situated, though.
- He's heavy. Oh, my God!
- You wanna hold him?
I guess this is how the peoples
on TV feel at Christmas time.
- Don't drop him.
- Come on. I only work with children.
You know how you are. 
I saw you. . .
When we were putting up the tree,
you dropped half the top of it.
They're so nice to me and Abdul.
- Be careful. Hold him with both hands.
- please.
Oh, Abdul.
Merry Christmas, Precious.
Thank you.
Why peoples that barely know me
should be nicer to me
than my mother and my father?
I felt warm.
- What?
- I'm just. . .
I'm just concerned about the baby
and the cats upstairs.
They're fine.
Grandmother's scared of Momma.
I know that's why
she ain't letting me stay with her.
If Ronald McDonald were running things. . .
Ms. Rain say don't be afraid of nothing.
I bet she ain't scared of Momma.
Wouldn't you be a little bit suspicious?
Just write the book.
- Well, who's gonna read it?
- Nobody, if you don't write it.
You know, Precious writes every day.
You should try it.
Is that right?
What do you write about, Precious?
Stuff.
My life. Abdul.
How come y'all don't like McDonald's?
Katherine was just drawing a comparison
so that her point could be
more easily understood.
Yes.
They talk like TV channels i don't watch.
My Uncle Clayton.
I'm glad Abdul here to listen in on them,
though, 'cause I know they're smart.
Before he got saved,
he used to smoke like a chimney
and drink like a fish.
I don't understand a 
word they're saying.
You understand?
Y'all be watching Oprah?
No. I don't, actually.
You know what time i get home from work.
- I watch it.
- Momma say homos is bad peoples.
But Momma,
homos not ones who raped me.
And what do that make you?
Homos not ones who let me sit in class
all them years and never learn nothing.
The homos not ones who sell crack
to peoples in Harlem.
- . . .that I have ever seen. Tell her!
- That doesn't work.
I wonder what Oprah got to say about that.
Ms. Rain is the one
who put the chalk in my hand,
made me queen of the ABC's.
After I settled at the halfway house,
I worked my hardest
to memorize letter sounds,
writing in the journal,
and reading smaller and fatter books.
Then I found out the Mayor's office
give me a literacy award
and a check for progress.
One, two, three.
The party is on.
Go, Joann!
Let me see what you got!
Everybody come. Nurse John, Cornrows,
all the staff was out there.
Even Ms. Katherine showed up.
Precious.
What's up?
What's that?
What does it look like?
plastic stupid apple.
A little something for you.
- Is there more money in it?
- You're so greedy.
Yo, who's that?
What?
- What?
- Come on.
Precious, where are you taking me?
What am i supposed to do, diva? Yeah?
Wait a minute. Hold on, girl.
Yeah. . .
My mom called last night.
And we don't really have a relationship.
We don't talk,
because she really has a problem with. . .
Some folks got a light around them
that shine for other peoples.
I think maybe some 
of them was in tunnels,
and in that tunnel,
maybe the only light they had
was inside of them.
Then i thought about how strong
you've had to be.
And then,
even long after they escaped that tunnel. . .
- I'll help you clean up.
- Okay.
... they still be shining for everybody else.
That's Ms. Rain to me.
''Awar d for Outstanding Achievement.''
In a book I read,
this lady escaped to a halfway house.
And when she was there,
she asked the people there
what a halfway house was.
They told her it was halfway between
her old life and where she wanna be.
That's kind of nice.
That also mean 
i can't stay here forever.
There's still a way to go.
It'd be something to 
get my own apartment.
Abdul nine months and almost walking.
He's smart, too.
I've been reading to him
since the day he was born.
He's barely talking,
but he's already counting.
Momma, Daddy,
IS 1 1 1, 4 4 4 Lenox all seem
like some old, bad dream.
I wish i could've just started out here,
but still with Abdul.
I'm gonna get Mongo, too.
I gotta get Mongo back.
Hey, Miss Cassidy.
Hey, Precious,
somebody downstairs for you.
- Who is It?
- I didn't ask who it was.
You want me to watch the baby?
No, I gotta go down 
and get him anyway.
Your daddy dead.
That's all?
He had that AIDS virus.
There you go, 
dreaming again.
Precious, do you hear me talking to you?
Did you hear what i said?
You got it?
Got what?
- The AIDS virus.
- No.
How do you know?
We never did it up in the ass, 
so i know.
You better get to a doctor, Mom.
You coming home?
Yo, Preoious!
Rita, what do i mean 
when i say the author
descri bes her protagonist's circumstances
as ''unrelenting''?
I don't know. 
I don't know.
It's like, say, like if Rita,
she tries to do something,
and she's going and she's going,
and me, I try to stop her
and she no stop, she keep on going.
Relentless-un.
I'll see you tonight. 
Bye.
Come with me.
Precious?
Excuse me?
Nurse say I'm HIV positive.
I ain't got nothing to write today.
Is your baby okay?
He all right.
I just got to stop breastfeeding him.
Remember, you once told me
you never really got to tell your story.
- Write.
- Fuck you!
You know nothing
of what I've been through.
I ain't never had no boyfriend.
My daddy said he gonna marry me.
How he gonna do that?
It would fucking be illegal!
Write.
I'm tired, Ms. Rain.
If not for yourself,
then for the people who love you.
Nobody loves me.
people do love you, Precious.
please don't lie to me, Ms. Rain.
Love ain't done nothing for me.
Love beat me, raped me,
called me an animal,
make me feel worthless.
Make me sick.
That wasn't love, Precious.
Your baby loves you.
I love you.
Write.
What are you thinking?
You never told me about
your relationship with your mother.
I didn't, did i?
Really, I'm here to help you.
You can talk to me.
This is a safe environment.
You're right.
We could talk about your daddy instead.
We could talk about my mother, my father,
my aunts or my sister or my brother,
but none of it's gonna help you.
You don't even like me.
Have we not been in this room together
for, like, a year, discussing your life?
Does that mean we like each other,
because we discuss my life?
I can't speak for you.
I can only speak for me,
and I do like you. I do.
So, are you Italian, or. . .
What color are you , anyway?
Are you some type of black or Spanish?
What color do you think i am?
No, I'd like to know.
What color do you think i am?
My throat is dry.
Your throat is dry?
It's really hot in here.
It is kind of hot in here.
I'm gonna go get a soda.
What do you want?
Soda sounds fine.
All right.
Thank you.
No problem.
So, I have to talk to 
you about your mother,
and I don't know
how you're gonna feel about this,
but she says she wants to see you
and she wants to be reunited
with you and her grandchildren.
She wants to come
and have a session here with you.
What did you tell her?
I said i had to speak to you about it.
It's up to you.
I don't know.
I never thought about it before.
Ms. Weiss said in that file I got HIV.
She said I was supposed to die from it.
I ain't worried about dying.
Shit, I gotta worry about
how I'm supposed to raise these kids.
I was just writing, like, about. . .
I wanna open up this clinic
about, like, mothers and their children.
You know, just,
if they're sick or something like that.
I always wanted to do that,
give back to the community.
Because I know my mom would be
proud of me if i did that,
and my children, too.
I want my children to be proud
of their mother, you know?
- That's always what I wanted to do, so. . .
- That's good. That's really nice.
I don't really want to read the whole thing,
I kind of just wanna say what it's about.
Okay, the counselors
at Advanoement House,
they were quizzing me
about my mother and my father, right?
But it's not really about them.
They're trying to get me to do workfare.
- They want me to be a home attendant.
- How do you know?
Because I stole my file and I read it.
All they want me to do is work.
Now, I do wanna work,
but not for no welfare check.
What kind of sense that make,
for somebody like Precious to quit school
before she got her GED
and go work
for some old white people somewhere?
She ain't never gonna be nothing
if she gets stuck in some shit like that.
Rhonda used to home attend.
She used to have to go all the way out
to Brighton Beach.
Yeah, okay, Rhonda would be
working there all day and night.
She'd be on call, right?
She made $6.37 an hour,
but for only eight hours.
That equal out to $50.96.
But that's not a whole lot of money,
especially 'cause,
for real, she there for 24 hours.
So, $50.96 divided by 24
is $2.12 an hour. 
That's not a lot of money.
She said that old bitch would ring a bell,
like, a real-life, actual bell
when she wanted something from her
in the middle of the night.
- You don't want to do that shit.
- Rhonda, is that true? Rhonda!
Them home attendants be working for, like,
six days a week.
I'd only see Abdul on Sunday.
plus, I'd have to leave class.
Well, that's not an option.
You're not leaving class.
plus, I'm gonna start going to
insect survivor meetings.
It's ''incest.''
- That ain't what i said?
- No, you said ''insect.''
What's the difference?
Well, one's where your family molests you,
the other's like a roach or bugs.
- So, you a scientist now?
- I'm just saying.
No, that's cool. 
Thank you. Thank you.
It was hard telling them strangers there
what my father did.
Sometimes it felt good.
Last week, Ms. Rain asked us
to write down what we wanna be like.
I wrote that I be real skinny,
with light skin and long hair.
Loretha Holloway?
Go on back there.
She read it and said 
I'm beautifuI like i am.
But, there's no kids back there
for me to play with.
Just shut up and sit there, then.
Gonna talk to this lady
before my shit gets cut off.
But somehow,
right now. . . 
And I don't know why, but. . .
I think she right.
Here.
Claireece Jones?
I think she right.
Okay, Mrs. Johnston ,
let's talk about the abuse.
There were no drugs in my house.
I didn't play that.
There weren't no drugs in my house.
Precious knew i would whup her ass
if she gonna bring some drugs
up in my house.
You know what I'm talking about.
I'm referring to specific
sexual and physical acts
involving Precious.
Why you ain't say that?
Yes, that.
What do you wanna know?
According to Precious' files,
she has now had two children
by your boyfriend,
the late Carl Kenwood Jones,
who was also her father.
- Yeah.
- This is accurate?
Yes, Ms. Weiss.
I need to know why you're here.
You've been calling this office
saying you want to be reunited
with Precious and your grandchild.
Now, I really need to know
what's gone on in that home.
Ms. Weiss,
I understand we need to discuss it,
but I'm just telling you.
You said I've been calling here
and I've been wanting to see
Precious and my grandson.
You're goddamn right I wanna see them.
Because they belong to me. Okay?
Now, there was a time
Precious had everything,
and i done told her that.
And me and Carl, we loved Precious.
And you need to know that.
We loved Precious and we had dreams.
Precious was born around the same time
Ms. West's son got killed.
The summer time.
She was born in the summer time.
Remember? 
Remember that?
I was born in November.
November.
Yeah, that's right.
My Scorpio child.
You know. . .
Scorpios, they can be tricky.
And, I'm not saying that they lie.
I'm not saying that.
But you just gotta watch them.
Can we talk about the actual acts
of physical and sexual abuse
that occurred in your household?
When it first began,
where it happened
and how did you respond?
Precious was a little girl.
Try and remember
how old you think she was.
She was three.
And I had been giving her the bottle
and I was giving Carl the tittie
because my milk hadn't dried up
in my breasts
but not from her, 
but because Carl was. . .
Because Carl was sucking on them
and that's what kept my milk in my breasts.
And I thought that 
that was for hygiene.
I did what my mother told me
that I was supposed to do with my child,
so that's what i did.
And you're sitting up there
and you're trying to judge me. . .
I'm not judging you,
but you're asking me for money
and you're asking me
to be reunited with your grandson.
But, Ms. Weiss,
I don't like you looking at me like that.
You got this bitch looking at me
like I'm some kind of fucking monster.
We don't talk like 
this in my office, okay?
I didn't want her suoking behind him,
because that was nasty.
And things that he was. . .
It was just nasty, Ms. Weiss.
I had a man , 
and i have a child
and I had to take care of both of them.
Okay?
Did i want Carl to touch my baby?
Because i would lay my baby.
I would lay her on the side of me,
on this pillow
and it was pink
and it had this little white writing on it
and it had her name,
because she was Precious.
And i would lay my baby on that pillow
and Carl would be laying on the other side
and then we would . . .
We would start doing it
and he reached over
and he touched my baby.
And i asked him,
I said, 
''Carl, what are you doing?''
And he told me to shut. . .
To shut my fat ass up,
and it was good for her.
- And what did you do then?
- I shut my fat ass up.
And I don't want you to sit there
and judge me, Ms. Weiss.
You shut up
and you let him abuse your daughter?
I did not want him 
to abuse my daughter.
- I did not want him to hurt her.
- But you allowed him
- to hurt her.
- I did not want him to do nothing to her.
I wanted him to make love to me.
That was my man.
That was my fucking man.
That was my man
and he wanted my daughter.
And that's why i hated her.
Because my man,
who was supposed to be loving me,
who was supposed
to be making love to me,
was fucking my baby.
She made him leave.
She made him go away.
So, whose fault was it, then?
It's this bitch's fault
because she let my man have her
and she didn't say nothing.
She didn't scream. 
She didn't do nothing.
So, those things she told you 
I did to her,
who else was gonna love me?
Since you got your degree
and you know every-fucking-thing,
who was gonna love me,
who was gonna make me feel good?
Who was gonna touch me
and make me feel good late at night?
And she made him go away, so. . .
When you sit there and you write
them fucking notes on your pad
about who you think i am,
and why i did it, all of that.
Because i didn't have nobody.
The people from
Each One Teach One,
they had . . . 
They called me
and they told me that my baby
was writing poems.
In fact, you know what, 
I got. . .
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
And, Ms. Weiss, I don't want no checks.
I don't need no more money. please.
I'm so sorry.
I took that TABE test again.
And what happened?
I scored a 7.8.
Last time it was 2.8.
According to that test,
I'm reading at
a seventh and eighth-grade level.
Next year, high school. 
Atter that, college.
Well, i like you, too.
But you can't handle me.
You can't handle none of this.
You know, I never knew what you was
until this day.
Not even atter all them things you did.
Maybe i was too stupid, or
maybe i just didn't want to.
You ain't gonna see me no more.
Bye!
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.
Please, God,
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.
Ms. Weiss,
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.
I would say to him, 
I would say. . .
''Carl, what are you doing?
What are you doing? What are you doing?''
Can you go get her back?
You can do that,
because that's what you do.
That's what you do.
I need you to go
and I need you to get my baby back.
You told me that I could come in here
and you could get. . .
You could get Precious to say. . .
Ms. Weiss? Ms. Weiss? Ms. Weiss?
