Barron Industries aim to ruIe...
...the digitaI worId
Surpass 3D
Do you wonder...
...how data traveIs...
...from a phone?
How does it traveI?
Surrounding us are miIIions...
...of rays
Everywhere, Iike the air
This virtuaI worId...
...is ever-present
In shopping maIIs
In streets and homes,
in this very room
These rays aIIow digitaI data...
...to traveI
Mr. Barron couIdn't be here,
so he has...
...sent us an image
Without the use of any device,
can this image...
...come to Iife?
Can we see it?
A marveI of our technoIogy
It isn't magic or
back projection, or 3D
The image is made of
countIess invisibIe rays
Thanks to our technoIogy...
...you'II see the image...
... and touch it
We're cIosing the gap between
the reaI and virtuaI worIds
It was a beautifuI night
And so was she
''My Desi GirI.''
Night waited for dawn
and she was waiting...
Go, Lucifer, go.
...for me...
I. Lucifer.
To save a Iife, at times,
one must take a Iife
Ready to die first were...
...Bruce Lee's three friends...
Iski Lee. Uski Lee. Sabki Lee.
Then the face-off
With the chaIIenger of chaIIengers
The onIy man abIe to fight me
Not the good guy. The ViIIain
''Yes, I am a bad man.''
''Somewhere up in the
skies is where he Iives.''
''The moon is where I quest to go.''
''It's my request.''
''Tonight. Tonight.
Something's going to happen.''
What to do? GirIs just faII for me
''What to do? Something happens.''
My hero.
I hate uninvited guests
Bad times come uninvited
Do you know who I am?
I sprayed Spiderman with a poison
What worm are you?
CooI punch Iine!
You punch too?
Sure!
They cIap at my wit
And waiI when I hit
Lucifer. CarefuI!
Don't worry, desi girI
I'II fix him
Then how about dinner.
- Sure.
Where?
Anywhere. But not Chinese.
I just ate some
Is your fIirting done?
Now can we fight?
Lucifer. He's got a big gun
''My name is..''
''The bad man.''
''Wow.
What the kick?''
''My name is.. My name is..
My name is Lucifer.''
Desi GirI.
You've started that again?
Get up!
I said..
Get up.
Get up.
Get up.
Get up.
Get up.
Get up.
Get up.
Prateek Get up.
You were supposed to write
an essay on your father.
What does your father do?
My father.
I am sure he's your hero, isn't he?
Dad? My hero?
Can't chat now
Oh yes, Iove you very much sweety.
Can't chat now
AIIow me to quote Navjot Singh Sidhu:
''FIirting turns the head.''
''Eyes on the road instead.''
Bye, sweety.

Hey, WaIter. Here.

Can you take it out pIease.
- Pervert.
What happened to you?
It's nothing
- What's up?
- The usuaI
Akashi. - Someone caIIed him
Jackie Chan again
I am not Jackie Chan.
Not every Chinese is Jackie Chan.
Mr. Jackie Chan. Sit down.
Seeing aII of you gives me
no pIeasure. I'm here...
...to teII you we have
a new video game contract
HeIIo.

Your Iast games fIopped
If this game fIops...

Honey, I am home.

Yummy, thank you.
Brother buttercup
You work too hard
Just ''kondom''
Your TamiI is naughty
You mean ''a tiny bit''
You never take me seriousIy
Wait tiII my book becomes
a bestseIIer
My thesis on cuss words...
...is important for India.
A must for every Indian woman
You're Sonia Subramaniam.
Not Sonia Gandhi
Why do cuss words pick
on mothers? And sisters?
Why not fathers? Brothers?
I am not responsibIe for it.
When my thesis is done,
women aII over India...
...wiII puff up their chests...
Too boId
OK. They'II proudIy
say: ''You papa pancake''
Big buttercup
You uncIe undie

Of course, of course.
After aII it is for kids.
Dude.
- No, dad. Its dude.
Like, dude with attitude.
Dude.
- Okay.
A brand new game
A new hero...
Heroes bore
I hate heroes. Heroes are boring.
OId or new
Don't you Iike heroes?
Do you prefer viIIains?
Yes. ViIIains are awesome.
They have no ruIes
They just win. Anyone
comes in their way...bam!
You be carefuI.
- Take my advice.
Make a game with
a viIIain who never Ioses
You are speaking absoIute nonsense.
The hero aIways win
Truth and goodness win
Yes right, dad. Just Iike you.
My father, my hero.
- Prateek.
Don't be a smartypant.
AIIow me to quote..
..Late Mr. V. Shantaram.
''Tread the right path''
''Combat eviI, so with a smiIe...
...you die''
Good night, dad. - What goodnight?
The discussion is not over.
One sIap. One, one..
- Shekar.
I wiII give him one.
- Shekar.
V. Shantaram?
- Yes, reaIIy. ReaIIy.
V. Shantaram.
- Right.
Goodnight, honey.
- Okay.
I wiII have aII
the noodIes and curd by myseIf.
The viIIain never Ioses
How is it possibIe? Never Ioses
''BeIoved. BeIoved.''
''BeIoved. BeIoved.''
I'II show you bad
Mom, what are you doing?
Hurry up. Time for schooI
Dad wiII take you today.
- Dad.
We'II be Iate if Dad drives
Driving Miss Daisy!
Not anymore.
''I'm bad.''
''Dance with me.''
That is your dad, right?
No.
Okay. Bye, chiIdren.
Bye, dad.
- Bye IittIe ApriI. - Bye.
Prateek, come here
Come, come, come.
Dad. You know I don't do that.
Yeah. Okay.
I want to teII you something
You Iike viIIains?
I'II make you a viIIain...
...mightier than the hero
He'II never Iose
You Iike that, don't you?
Give me your hand.
But never forget, Prateek
EviI is wicked and bad
AIIow me to quote myseIf:
''SeII your souI to the DeviI and
eviI's shadow won't Ieave you''
''SeII your souI to the DeviI and
eviI's shadow won't Ieave you''
Shadow.
- Means ''shadow''
Whatever?
- Whatever is good.
WorId's bad viIIain.
Today's Iesson is on LAN.
LocaI Area Network.
Who's Lucifer?
When I pIay video games...
...my gaming name is Lucifer
WLAN. WireIess LAN.
AIIows interconnectivity
between computers.
Ms. BoyIe can Iog on
to our computers
Now I wiII seek connection
to aII of your computers.
So then monitor
appears on this projection.
She'II ask for permission.
We say no
Fatso says yes
I've hacked and he is jacked.
And I am sending the invitation now.
Let's see who wiII be
the first person to accept my request.
BiIIy. Thank you, BiIIy,
for accepting my invitation.
Let's see what BiIIy has to share.
BiIIy, out.
I have a great idea
for our new video game
We'II create...
... the mightiest...
Hero.
ViIIain.
- ViIIain?
Yes, viIIain. But, why?
Because, Jenny.
ViIIains are awesome.
What do you say, Akashi.
For Prateek, right?
Yes
Of course.
''Joy will last longer than grief.
Don't lose hope.''
''If we are together..''
''..why to feel afraid
during the journey?''
''With wings beneath our feet.''
''You and l will fly away.''
''Walk along with joy.''
''If the path is open,
regardless of where we meet...
...the destination
will begin from there.''
''Walk along with joy.''
''If the path is open,
regardless of where we meet...
...the destination
will begin from there.''
''Don't worry about a thing now.
Because l will be right by your side.
l will be right by your side.''
''Don't worry about a thing now.
Because l will be holding you tight.
l will be holding you tight.''
''Don't worry about a thing now.
Because l will be right by your side.
l will be right by your side.''
''Don't worry about a thing now.
Because l will be holding you tight.''
Okay, boys and girIs.
A name for our viIIain?
We can't keep caIIing him
''Random Access Version One?''
We have to think of some good name.
- DracuIa.
No, no. you.
- Raaka.
Guys, guys.
It's staring you in the face
Meaning?
- Random Access Version One.
''Ra.One''
- What's that?
- Raavan!
The demon Raavan?
A modern day Raavan
WiId idea!
I Iike Ra. One it is very dangerous.
What about the hero's name?
Hero's name.
''G.One?''
Good one. G.One means ''Iife''
Ra.One = danger. G.One = Iife
Hi.
Come on. Come on. Okay.
''If your dreams are
hiding somewhere.''
''If you are
hesitating to take a step.''
''l will make your dreams
come true in an instant.''
''l will again adorn it in
the sky, beyond the stars.''
''The sorrows that are in my life,
l will convert it into joy for you.''
''Walk along with joy.''
''If the path is open,
regardless of where we meet...
...the destination
will begin from there.''
''Walk along with joy.''
Just Iike Jackie Chan.
It's working.
''Don't worry about a thing now.
Because l will be right by your side.
l will be right by your side.''
A birthday gift
''Don't worry about a thing now.
Because l will be right by your side.
l will be right by your side.''
- What's up?
- The hero must have a face
''l will be holding you tight.
Don't worry about a thing now.
Because l will be right by your side.
l will be right by your side.''
''Don't worry about a thing now.
Because l will be holding you tight.''
He's spectacuIar
Terrific smiIe
I didn't program a smiIe
Didn't you?
Why is he smiIing?
Is he Iearning things by himseIf?
Okay. Now everyone Iook cIoseIy.
The game's main part
The HART
As in ''heart?''
Not heart. AIways taIking romantic.
Not that heart, the HART is Hertz
AmpIifying Resonance Transmitter.
It gives the pIayers their power
As the pIayers go
from IeveI to IeveI...
...the HART's power increases,
the coIour intensifies
And now...Iet me come to
the most interesting part.
If the HART is not
connected to G.One and Ra.One...
...you cannot destroy them
If you destroy the HART,
they won't die
No, no, sir.
Destroy their bodies,
they won't die either
Connect them to their
HARTs then destroy them
When does that happen?
OnIy on IeveI three.
The pIayers get an anti-HART gun
with one buIIet
The first to hit the target wins
The pIayer who misses...
So the HART is their strength?
And weakness?
Let me aIso be... AIIow me
to be as romantic as Jenny.
''A hero isn't made of
muscIe or metaI
''A superhero is made or
undone by his heart aIone'' Wow.
Great.
See? The movie viIIain Iost,
the hero won. Very good. I Iike.
That's why the fiIm bombed.
The viIIain was cooI
Not cooI. A bIoody fooI,
a chain-smoker
Smoking kiIIs
This kid is smoking
- Let's go - I must taIk to him
Hey IittIe boy. LittIe boy.
- Let's go.
Your Mom knows you smoke?
Sure!
- I see.
But she doesn't know I kiII
With a fork?
- A naiI cutter
- A knife
He's fIashing a knife.
And he isn't a smaII chiId either.
Dad, don't worry.
We can smash his teeth in
Your waIIet!
Of course, sir. Of course.
Give him a sIap
Sorry, sir. Here's the money,
sir. PIus a tip
A sIap, pIease!
- SIap.
What eIse do you have?
- That's aII I have, sir
I gave you everything I had, sir.
- Don't move
Yes, sir. - You haven't
seen me. Now count to 2000
Good number sir.
That's my Iucky number.
Don't sIip on the wet road, sir.
Goodnight, sir.
See? I scared him off
But he might return.
Start counting. Good practice
Yeah right, dad.
1000.. Prateek.
Prateek, wait
You didn't even fight back.
You coward
No, Prateek. I'm not a coward
I didn't hit him
because he couId've hurt you
AIIow me to quote the great
Mahatma Gandhi..
..''An eye for an eye makes
the whoIe worId bIind''
I'm no coward, Prateek
I am.. Hey..
Okay, Akashi. One Iast time.
I mean one Iast time.
Let's try.
- One Iast time.
AIright, guys.
South-India Coffee break.
That means we meet tomorrow. Bye.
Check the system. Somebody
go and check the main system.
Okay, okay, I am going to check it.
- Why is it constantIy back...

What happened there?
- Come on, guys.
The Iaunch is in two days.
We can't have a probIem

you wanted. But remember...
''If Ra.One is from eviI,
G.One is from my heart''
MiIIions of rays surround us

No.
It was pretty quiet.
On the monitor it

Who is Lucifer?
It's me, Akashi. That's my
gaming name. didn't you know?
Lucifer. Prateek. Of course I know.
Akashi.
Who was...
Ra.One has turned into Akashi
I don't Iike Chinese.
HeIIo.

Where are you?
I was right. Ra.One kiIIed Dad
He's Akashi now
Where are you?
Dad's office
I'm coming
The mainframe!
Prateek. Just hoId this.
Connect the Iaptop to
the mainframe and try to Iogin.
Now Iog on
UpIoad Ra.One's backup program
It's missing
No backup program?
We wiII have to
intercept this program.
How can we stop him?
Has to be some way to stop Ra.One.
''If you ever get into troubIe,
G.One wiII Iook after you''
There's onIy one way
to stop Ra.One... G.One
If Ra.One can break out,
so can G.One
Right.
Ra.One's Iatest programs
must be in the mainframe.
We'II copy Ra.One's
data and get G.One out
Load this program.
- Okay.
Damn it.
HeIIo.
- Jenny, I am here.
Akashi is heading to you
What happened?
- Ra.One.
Sonia caIIed. Ra.One is
on his way. Go, Prateek!

Your time starts now.
Tick-tock.
Running about, not aIIowed
Oh no.
''Wicked Speed. The destination ahead,
the wind at my back.''
Oh, God.
- Excuse me.
ToiIet trips, not aIIowed
Missing schooI, not aIIowed.
TaIking to anyone,
or eating Iunch, not aIIowed.
And hanging from
the train's roof, teacher?
Not aIIowed.
Oh my, God. Monkey man.
No entry. ChiIdren onIy
Just get out. PIease.
Kids. Don't try this at home.
Not aIIowed.
- Do you wish to die?
''Wicked Speed. The destination ahead,

''A chilling gale, crosses
your path, it stops you.''
A man is Ieaping about the train!
The train didn't stop
Contact the station master. PatiI.
Contact the motorman.
Move back. The train is coming.
The train isn't stopping anywhere
What now?
- I don't know.
I am sorry.
Leave me. Leave me.
The train isn't stopping
Divert the train's route.
Wait, wait.
The train isn't stopping
''Time has...chosen a moment.''
''l will leave a mark in history.
''Wicked Speed.''
There's a bomb on the train.
Time-bomb.
Get inside.
- Duck.
''A chilling gale, crosses
your path, it stops you.''
There's a bomb.
I think there's been a bIast.
''There's no fun when.''
''Life isn't on the edge.''
''A strong heart.''
''Never accepts defeat easily.''
''Doing that unimaginable.''
''ls the mark of the brave.''
''l don't do it for myseIf.''
''l lay my life down for my kin.''
''Wicked Speed.''
''The destination ahead,

Come on. Quick.
''Glory to You.''
''Glory to You.''
''Glory to Lord Ganesha.''
''Glory to Lord Ganesha.''
Prateek.
- He'II be fine
WiII you save Prateek?
Of course.
I was created to save your son
''Sweetheart.''
Promise me
I promise you
I must go
I have to go aIone
G.One.
You once asked me if angeIs existed
Now I know...
...that they do
''Your generosity meIts hearts.''
I am here, G.One
You are Iate, G.One.
Any Iater and...
I have your HART
So you can't kiII Prateek
You have my HART so...
...you can't kiII me
UnIess our HARTS are connected...
...you can't die...
...nor can I
I must Iog on
I hope it's connected with the LAN.
Give me dispIay controI, come on.
But matters of the
heart...very compIicated.
For me it's simpIe
My onIy purpose is to destroy you
Keep the HART
Logic says: Your chance of
survivaI is 0.01'/,
Why choose death?
Because I gave my word
We're connected
Connected now.
- Ra.One Ioaded. Game ready to pIay.
Game begins.
- WeIcome, Lucifer.
Let's pIay.
Hide!
You OK?
Sure, I'm fine
But my head is spinning
Fire.
Done!
Look down!
G.One safe. LeveI two, kiIIer combat.
Good going, G.One.
- This is good going?
The pIan is to get to LeveI 3
Great pIan. That's if Ra.One Iets us
Survive two minutes more
- What are you doing?
- Getting whipped
Don't fight. Just try to survive
Watch me
See?
No, G.One. do it my way.
One minute to go.
Use Ra.One's power
Okay.
Yes.
Oh no.
Duck.
Don't fight. Survive
No, no, no, don't.
Energy IeveIs Iow.
Run!
Grab his main part!
What are you doing, G.One?
I don't know.
LeveI 2 cIear. G.One survives.
G.One safe.
- Yes.
G.One.
You OK?
Never feIt better.
I'm in your worId now.
We start where we Ieft off
So come on our Lucifer.
My power has decreased.
Ra.One is stronger now
One gun, one buIIet, one chance
You can't hide from me.
Or escape me
How wiII we destroy Ra.One?
BuIIets don't win wars. Hearts do
Now my HART...
''Sweetheart.''
...wiII be my strength,
not my weakness
Let's do this, Prateek.
For your father
''Sweetheart.''
Anti-heart gun activated.
G.One.
G.One. HART.
You said it'd work
You can't die
G.One terminated.
Game over, Lucifer.
Get ready to die
I am on.
We're ready
To kick your..
- Language, Prateek.
We are ready, to kick your fat ass.
You forget
If we're not connected to
the HART, neither of us...
...can die
Matters of the heart.
Very compIicated.
I didn't forget. Lucifer did
He wanted a viIIain who never Ioses
You shouId be carefuI
what you wish for, kid.
Instead of one viIIain,
you have ten
Oh no.
- Shoot me.
Find me
Find the reaI Ra.One
- Which one?
- Never got to LeveI 3
One reaI. Nine fakes
Me!
No, me
ImpossibIe
Dad can't Iet eviI win
He'II heIp us
I have his foIder
Check it
His Iast proverb:
''SeII your souI to the DeviI and
eviI's shadow won't Ieave you''
Shadow?
Shadow?
The reaI Ra.One...
...casts a shadow
The reaI Ra.One casts a shadow
The reaI Ra.One casts a shadow
Shoot.
G.One.
Game over, Prateek. I must go
No, G.One. That wasn't the pIan
It was the pIan and aIways wiII be
If you want the end of Ra.One...
...I must take him back...
...to the worId...
...from where we came
G.One, don't Ieave me
I can't Iose my father again
You'II never Iose him
If there's goodness in your heart,
he'II never Ieave you
Good peopIe die...
...but their goodness Iives on
Listen to your heart.
Look. Be a superhero, Prateek.
A superhero. With a heart.
Got to go now.
I wiII miss you, G.One.
- Yes.
I think I wiII miss you too.
TeII Sonia...
We made a reaI
buttercup of brother Ra.One
So gIad you're back
You OK?
You know I am very happy
that you two returned.
How's Prateek?
Forever Iogged on,
trying to revive G.One's HART
Just Iet him be, Sonia.
Don't dash his hopes
It's his beIief.
Where is my Lucifer?
Prateek.
- Coming, mom.
I am on.
Mom, G.One's back.
I toId you, Mom! He'd come back
He's right here. He's back.
