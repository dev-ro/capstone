He talked bad about me?
Wanted to run away
but I tripped him.
Nobody says this
I say it now just like that?
She attracted everybody.
We’ve seen nothing from
She shouted all the time
Something stupid
It’ll kill everybody
Inducing hopelessness
In society
The secrecy
What is it to you?
Whoever saw her liked her.
Safety.
Excuse me!
One more time
If I don’t do it
How do I laugh?
She was an active girl
And she was noticeable too.
In this society,
women
Never mind
Violation of human rights
We are worried
Father
Society is like a child.
You must look after its breathing.
That is enough nagging.
You can’t force people to laugh.
Society needs hope too.
There must be hope in the society
to be shown, right?
You can’t put your hand
into your pocket,
take it out, and say,
“This is hope!”
Admit it isn’t right
to show the society naked.
It is like someone doesn’t
wear trousers...
and walks in the streets
butt naked
What is wrong with it?
It is very correct.
If civil protest cannot
take form in a society,
that society will get ill.
People will start nagging
and express their dissatisfaction...
...in an immoral way.
We must ready the atmosphere
for the dynamism of the young generation.
Hope must be created.
There must be hope so I feel it.
If you don’t have a positive feeling,
you mustn’t say it.
You mustn’t dispirit society.
You must give it spirit, hope,
passion, happiness, love.
I kiss the hand of this great lady.
The impact of proper social behaviour
is much more than giving mottos.
If such behaviour is done
by a woman,
a woman whose right is usually
trampled in the society,
it will certainly have a deeper
impact in the society.
We must be very careful.
A Chinese poet says,
“The children threw rocks
at the frogs jokingly,
but the frogs died really.”
Lantouri
A Film by Reza Dormishian
Lantouri means
Ms Zarrabi
Lawyer, Women’s Rights Activist
Lantouri means
Leech, mosquito
Mr Naderi
Shop Owner
Have you seen
how a mosquito sucks blood?
Like that jerk!
We mustn’t judge people
superficially and label people.
Mr Zarrabi
Sociologist and Poet
Thousands of factors play a role
in a person’s character.
Everything must be analysed;
childhood, adolescence.
It isn’t fair to label people.
It is quite fair, actually!
It isn’t fair when women and children,
the people’s family,
do not feel safe and secure.
What are you defending?
Lantouri has its own meaning.
It means someone without conscience,
without wisdom, cruel, a sponger.
It is lantouri.
They punched me in a way
I was dealing with humans or animals!
Sa’eed
Self-employed
A bunch of thugs attacked me.
I can’t believe what you say!
Hadi
Pasha’s Classmate
I’ve rarely seen someone like that.
A real human.
His heart is like an ant’s.
I don't know if you know or not...
...Pasha and I grew up in this orphanage.
Whenever we feel down,
we come here.
Maybe you don’t believe that Pasha
I don't know if he allows me
to say these or not,
but he is very charitable.
We have a Tree of Dreams here.
Children without parents
or with bad parents...
...write their dreams and
attach them to the branches.
Compassionate people
make those dreams come true.

Any car?

These children
really mattered to Pasha
Maybe Pasha somehow
saw himself in them.
Every month Pasha and Baroon came here
and fulfil one of the children’s dreams.
When I say 1, 2, 3,
say cheese!
- 1, 2, 3!
- Cheese!
They are all stories.
They make them up
to give him an air of humanity.
Wait!
They want to say
he is a Robin Hood!
Who is Robin Hood?
Why are they making up
these stories?
Find out the philosophy
of making up such stories.
They want to make youths
believe such things.
A thief is a thief,
whether he steals for himself
or for the needy.
Who has seen it except Hadi?
Bring someone else who has seen it
and I will believe it.
Me!
Me!
Baroon is a very kind girl.
I can’t say enough about her.
She is different from others.
They say some things about her.
I really don’t know.
It is her own life.
She knows best.
Hit her if she hit you,
got it?
1, 2, 3!
Pasha is still a kid.
That’s why he liked them.
Paint this part completely.
You paint this part.
You paint the leg.
Start when I tell you.
I didn’t run away.
I married and came to Tehran.
I was 16.
He was 50, a junkie,
and earned money with me.
I sued him
and got divorced.
I worked till I met Pasha.
He cared about everybody
except himself.
We started extorting together.
What matters now is that
Pasha’s life is divided into two parts;
before and after Maryam.
I met Maryam many years ago.
Elham
Social Worker
We met in the classroom,
before I became a social worker.
Maryam was a photographer,
journalist,
very idealist,
and very persistent!
She thought she could
talk to the people easily,
influence them,
and convince them.
What are you looking for?
Aren’t you tired?
She was very young
when she lost her mother in an accident.
Her mother sacrificed her life
in the accident to save Maryam’s life.
Their relatives were all abroad.
She’d grown up alone,
on her own feet.
Maybe it was the reason her world
was different from normal people.
She wasn’t the type
to finish with her subjects...
...after an article or a photo on
them was published.
Her job started
when her article was published.
She got involved with them.
She lived with them.
She became a part of them.
Her life was her job.
She was an extremist.
She would launch the campaign
No to Violence,
World without War,
Forgiveness.
I kill just like that?
Why do you say that?
Someone who’s been oppressed has lost
hermental and emotional balance
How do you give such a person the right
to decide who must die or live?
He’s killed my husband.
When I ask the victim’s mother
how she feels 2 years after the execution,
she says
she has not found calmness.
So, if the murder was the first step
in destroying the family,
the second step was the hanging.
We must be able to talk
to each other.
We must be able to like those
who aren’t like us.
You want to deprive someone
of the right to live,
only because
he has done a crime?
The murder and execution statistics
have never been related.
When she started reports
about juvenile delinquents,
she could not leave it
any more.
She was always in
Juvenile Correction Centre.
I think if was mostly because
my father didn't have a job
You did the right thing.
Crack's terrible.
You kept telling the judge i smoked crack
Then she would organise exhibitions
to gather money...
...for those who’d been sentenced
to death to pay the blood money.
You feel down even
when you think about hanging.
Now imagine someone
who socialises all day long...
...with minor children
who have committed murder.
She had quit collecting money
for the blood money,
and went to the families of the victims to
convince them to take back their complaint
I hope the same happens to her child,
so she knows what we go through.
Come out!
We expected the law to apply justice here
otherwise I have5 brothers who could handle it
They lied to me she was alive
in the ICU, but she had die.
Go out!
Get lost!
Aren’t you ashamed of
defending a murderer?
I’m sorry.
I didn’t mean to hurt you.
- I just wanted to talk to you.
- I don't want you to talk!
I won’t forgive him!
Don’t you get it?
He’s killed my daughter.
My only daughter!
He is sick.
Why I should see
my only daughter in the shroud,
instead of
the wedding gown?
- How old was my daughter?
- Sohrab is mentally ill.
Can you return your daughter
back to life by killing Sohrab?
Why do you keep saying ‘killing’?
As if I have killed someone!
He has killed someone
and must be punished.
Get out!
I won’t go anywhere
until you consent.
I won’t consent.
How are you related to him?
We are not related.
He has nobody to come to you.
What is it to me
he doesn’t have anybody?
Did he think who I have?
The one who has given you
the right to request hanging...
...has given you the right
to forgive too.
I forgive him so he goes to the street
and kills someone else?
I won’t forgive him.
Get out!
Go out
and write whatever you like.
Write we are killers,
our hearts are made of stone,
and we won’t forgive!
Get lost!
I didn’t want to kill her.
One day I went to their house.
I loved her.
Why I should hurt her?
I waited so long till her mother left
and she was alone.
Maryam always tried to convince people
to take back their complaint.
It had even made trouble for her
in the newspaper she worked.
The concert is cancelled again?
Sara, have you read this?
OK, thank you.
I’ll be waiting for your call.
She is insulting me.
Why do you get angry?
He is the manager.
Go talk to him.
She was very active.
Very persistent in her job.
That’s why
everybody noticed her.
Sara
Journalist
If I want to talk,
I must say many things.
These guys in Photography Section,
they talked behind her back.
Sit down, please.
- You wrote this?
- Yes.
- Thank God you admit you did.
- Yes, I do.
- SAVING A HUMAN?
- You think it is a bad headline?
Why should the foreigners read
about lex talionis?
Not to mention in this situation
when
What do you want to prove
with your report?
Who do you want
to fawn with?
Or maybe you want
to make a name for yourself?
Well said!
The foreigners who
talk about human rights now,
have forgotten
their own history.
How much did you violate
the human rights?
And a bunch of
embassy-dweller opportunists...
...want to go abroad
and put on an opposition face.
If you want to go abroad,
do it with dignity.
Why do you disgrace
your own country?
A nasty guy rapes some people.
What should be done to him?
Sit back and watch him?
Obviously he must be punished.
Why such an issue
must be highlighted?
Have you read my article?
What?
You mean you didn’t write it?
I said I wrote it.
So you admit you wrote it.
Then you are offended
when they call you a spy?
How are they related?
You call a spy whoever writes
something outside Iran?
Did I say that?
Is that really my viewpoint?
I am a cultural man,
a journalist.
I am one of you.
I meant we shouldn’t allow such
a view to form unwillingly.
Do you want our newspaper to be banned
because of you,
and some people
lose their income?
Is that proper?
Write a commitment letter
so I can justify it.
From now on, you won’t work
with any media except us,
either domestic or foreign.
She talked behind my back?
Mr Hamidi
Newspaper Manager
We didn’t see anything bad
from her.
She was a little distracted though.
Everything I told her
was for her own good.
The law is always the main point
for us.
We always abide by the law.
And what she did outside the newspaper
is her own responsibility.
She was stubborn.
Yes, stubborn.
I never thought she would
befriend such a boy
She didn’t appreciate herself.
I’d never seen her with a boy.
Maybe it isn’t right to say that
but she was a bit off in this regard.
She wasn’t interested in such things.
Not to mention with Pasha,
much younger than her.
Their relation was a bit strange.
But if you aren’t strange nowadays,
it isn’t normal.
I wasn’t going to be this.
I studied Maths
in Roodehen University.
Our teacher was teaching rubbish
and I left the class.
He had talked behind my back.
So, I dragged him out
and punched him in the eye.
It is false.
Mr Ardalan
Police Officer
We investigated.
Neither was he a student at that time
nor a fight has been reported.
I thought I didn’t belong
to university any more.
I decided to work in a factory.
But it didn’t happen.
There were sanctions
and the factory was closed down.
I became friends with Pasha
when he’d come with Baroon...
...to exchange $30,000.
Then he wanted to nick me.
Didn’t know
I was from deep downtown.
I said the end.
- 3,700.
- 800.
- 700.
- 800.
- 700.
- 800.
- It was 700 in the morning.
- It is afternoon now!
- I’ll come tomorrow morning.
- What if it’ll be 4,000?
3,700?
Say 800.
Don’t be mean.
We are buying 30,000.
Have character!
Pull over.
So I became one of them.
They say people are more successful
when they work as a team.
We became a team.
Baroon, Pasha, and me.
There was someone else too;
Lanky Bahram.
He was a petty thief.
As he was taller than everybody,Pasha
said he was good for climbing the walls
I loafed in the streets
since childhood.
Didn’t have proper parents to tell me
what to do and what not to do.
Idling away in the streets.
Robbed anyone I liked in the street.
Depended on my luck what to get.
Sometimes money and debit cards,
sometimes nothing.
Everything changed
when I joined the guys.
Lantouri Gang
was formed that way.
Lantouri?
Newspapers gave us the title.
We weren’t after such things.
I’d never been a member of
a band, gang,
or a political party,
God forbid!
Lantouri wasn’t a gang.
It was a team.
Maybe it wasn’t even a team.
We were four guys
without any boss or member.
We were just together.
That is false.
He was the member of the gang.
There is proof too.
He was in fact an important member.
Carrying, possession, and making of
cold weapons is not illegal,
but if you use them for extortion,
stalking, threatening, or displaying power,
it is a crime
and you will be prosecuted.
The weapon gives him power.
Nobody carries a dagger
to peel fruits with it!
The one with a dagger in the street
is not the only thug in the street.
The real thug is the one
who has 10 ID cards and passports,
flies on a private plain, gets off
anywhere in the world he wishes.
He is afraid of blood but he sucks
the blood of millions of people every day.
He gives weapon instead of pen to
ten-year-old African, Afghan, Iraqi kids.
He is the thug.
These are just chickens.
They are hungry guys
who have gone nuts.
Whatever happens,
they arrest these quickly,
but they can’t arrest those.
They will run away
even if they surround them.
Thug is the one
who wears a tie,
looks at the people through
intellectual round glasses
Open your tie,
become like people,
and then talk bookish!
Other people pilfer
this country’s money,
but you get upset for it,
and I get thrashed for it!
OK, you are the good one!
We quit petty theft little by little
and went to rich kids;
Tehran’s loaded girls and boys.
We didn’t work in a calculated way
with a list and say,
let’s go after him or her because
their father was this or that.
Their money mattered to us.
So many people are hungry.
How can he afford a two-billion car?
We really didn’t know who from
we were stealing.
I don't know Mr R.
Nor Mr K.
We didn’t know anything.
We found out later they
were economically corrupt,
embezzlers,
and other things.
We weren’t after such things.
We were after their money.
And it was important to us that
they all have a weakness for women,
thank God!
Once a man a Mr A called us and said,
“You stole the car of Mr R’s son?”
We were surprised how he’d got
our telephone number.
He said, “The Porsche you stole,
smash it on the motorway crash barrier.”
We didn’t ask anything else
and smashed it on the crash barrier.
It is clear
it is the product of his imagination.
Whoever was caught in our net
could not escape easily,
because we got money from
them as much as we could.
Every case was different.
We blackmailed someone
for two years for his reputation.
He paid the money every month.
He didn’t object the least.
Here.
Brill!
Go to him in the morning.
They are extortioners.
What does it mean?
This!
Mr Ahmadi
They must be shown
so the youths understand...
...what is waiting for them
when they do illegal work.
They mustn’t be shown.
It will become ordinary.
No, they must be shown.
But the public opinion must not be fooled
when they play possum.
I respect artists but
It has a bad effect.
We must find the roots.
Don’t do anything
his Likes go up.
A doctor has 200 followers,
but a criminal must have 200,000?
What can I do except stealing?
Have you ever tried that
you ask what to do now?
Does my father do inside trading
or possesses plots?
My father is a big fish?
Who am I?
How can I afford my
mother’s hospital expenses?
He is playing possum.
See us too.
It is only because some want everything
to be theirs and only they use them.
And the rest
shouldn’t have calm or income.
Don’t I like to live
like well-off guys?
Dress like them,talk like them,
and behave like them?
The sound of their cars when
they spin gets on my nerve
I know the meaning of
every horn they blow.
You have surely seen it.
I don't want to be insulting
but I have been among them.
I know
what bastards they are!
I know what they do
to the country’s money.
You have a good car
but I don’t.
It is inequality.
You have good clothes
but I don’t.
You have a good house
but I don’t.
So I scratch your car,write
insults on the wall of your house,
damage it,
and tear your clothes.
Because a sick mind
considers it inequality.
You tell me what to do
and I will do it.
They have never looked
for work.
They are only after
someone to blame
They want to blame others
for their laziness.
What is everybody doing?
How are they earning so much?
What is it to you?
Are you responsible
to enforce the law?
Whoever did something illegal,
we must answer him by something illegal?
We must refer to the law.
I have repented.
Show me a way.
Who sees us?
I get angry when I see
they can buy anything they want.
When did I like to be
wearing these clothes?
To sit in front of you
like this?
When we deprive people of sunlight,
when we get happiness,
smile, light, colour,
park, bench, street,
and the sea from people,
nothing will remain for them.
People are dead.
They can’t distinguish
any more.
Not everybody
can control themselves.
Ten million can,
ten can’t.
We must find out what we have done
that they are in this situation.
When there is no discrimination
in the society...
...and all people work hard equally,
nobody runs away from work
and does not fear hardship.
By God stealing is hard too.
It isn’t easy at all.
He is playing possum.
Seeing people
who become very rich overnight...
...in the society
can cause crimes.
One takes 100 billion,
another 200 billion,
another 500 billion.
I ask you.
How much is the budget
for Ministry of Health?
It wasn’t about that.
Pasha said they had
taken the kids’ right.
He was right.
How can they make so much money
without trampling on others’ right?
Show me a right way
to earn so much money.
Sure!
These are all false talks.
I think you can take all of it
out of your film.
What false talks?
They are reality.
- Only lies.
- Absolute truth.
Take it from me.
Take out this part completely.
You’re not looking for trouble,
surely?
Let me delete it.
Which button is it?
Lantouri has gone nuts.
He thinks people have picked his pocket
and he must pick others’ pocket.
It gives me shivers
to take from others.
I hate it.
I’ve stolen many times but
never picked someone’s pocket
Throw everything
out of your pocket!
OK, I will.
The front pocket.
Give your mobile.
Back pocket too!
Don’t turn around!
The Lantouri gather around
and become DAESH.
They become powerful and big
and become DAESH.
Each of us has a Hitler
and Mandela inside us.
It depends on the society
to take out which one.
To take out Radovan Karadžić,
Slobodan Milošević,
Bin Laden, Mullah Omar,
Saddam, and Gaddafi,
or great people such as Gandhi,
Mandela
True extortion causes violence
in the society,
thank God it has been eradicated
in our society.
I’m not saying
we don’t have it.
We do, but not as much as
you are exaggerating.
I haven’t ever seen Pasha
beating someone.
Of course it is a lie.
It is all for scaring.
He did beat others, but used
the knife only once.
Give the bag!
Give it or I’ll hit you!
Run!
Pasha!
Pasha!
Why are you standing?
Come.
He was sitting and crying
like a child.
Lantouri was going its way
right till that day.
You do?
I like you more.
How old are you, chick,
that they give you the car?
How old you like me to be?
Think you’re big?
I’ll show you who’s big!
Where are you going?
Move and I’ll slit your throat!
Lower the knife.
They might see it.
Mobile!
Wallet!
Hurry!
- Password?
- 5321.
Show your watch.
Am I kidding?
Take it off.
Hurry!
What is your jacket’s brand?
- Fake?
- Original.
It’s fake.
By God it’s original.
It’s fake!
Take it off.
His trousers are mine.
How much do you pay
we let you go?
How much do you want?
- 22 OK?
- Yes.
Not 22.
Good.
I don't have that much now.
- What about your daddy?
- He isn’t in Iran.
- Mummy?
- She isn’t either.
Borrow.
Give back my mobile to call.
- No tricks!
- No tricks.
What are you doing, animal?
He saw her again after a year.
Pasha saw Maryam first
in Siyavash incident.
We called him ‘cousin’.
He’d killed someone.
And Maryam wanted
to get consent for him.
Pasha came to like Maryam
but couldn’t tell her.
It wasn’t the right time.
Until Pasha saw Maryam
again that day
He went after her
to her house.
You’re thinking about her?
She thinks about you?
She is your thought?
Tell her.
I didn’t say
and she has a baby now.
What is it to me?
Suit yourself.
I want you to do me a favour,
but Baroon mustn’t find out.
I’ll never forget that pull.
We were cheated.
Pasha didn’t give our share.
He gave me my share.
I was surprised very much when he
called to make an appointment.
Well?
He was a funny boy.
He wanted to know about Maryam
and how to tell her he loved her,
and what kind of a girl
she was.
I asked him
What do you want from me?
He only stared at me.
I asked him.
Where did you get my number?
He said he’d got it from
a common friend.
I didn’t find out who.
What should I’ve told him?
How did you call me?
Call Maryam in the same way.
It was interesting.
What do you like about her?
Suppose I am Maryam.
What do you want to tell her?
He talked about Maryam non-stop.
I didn’t realise how
he pumped me for information.
Let me tell you a secret.
Maryam’s life is her work.
Her love is her work.
If you want Maryam to like you,
you must become a part of her work.
Get involved in her work.
Not everything about her,
but I told him some things.
What is it?
I’m going to her.
And he followed Maryam.
Pasha started stalking her.
He did everything
to reach Maryam.
It came out?
No.
Don’t touch your eye
with our dirty hand.
Something will get
into your eye.
Baroon,
come here a moment.
Shall I call someone to come
and take her out of your mind?
She thought I wanted to
take away the boy from her
Not to mention I told the boy
what to do, what not to do.
They’ve given Sohrab
death penalty.
- Nothing can be done now?
- Not any more.
They will send him to Evin
in two days for execution.
You can’t do anything?
- Maryam, who is this boy?
- Which boy?
- Who?
- That car.
Nobody.
Was it a taxi?
How lucky!
- You do know me.
- No, not any more.
Nothing can be done
for Sohrab?
Can’t someone else
go to his family?
You talked to them.
They said
they didn’t want to see anybody.
They might give consent if
someone else goes to them
No way.
- Who was the boy?
- Nobody.
I know.
We’ll do anything we can.
Have you got a cigarette?
By God she was breathing.
I loved her.
Why should I hurt her?
She didn’t let me.
I said,
“I love you.”
She said,
“Shut up!”
I put my hand on her mouth.
I was afraid.
There was blood everywhere.
She’d fallen down the stairs
but she was breathing.
- We will talk tomorrow.
- All right.
The secrecy is not nice.
Why do you lie?
Some like to play secrecy.
I don't really understand why.
That is how they are.
Pasha brought her to
the meth kitchen to me too
-Shutup
-Shutup
She was a nice girl.
Everybody knows me, Earthworm.
No need to hide it from me.
I can show you the pictures
before publication.
The girl kept asking us questions.
As if she hadn’t seen cooking.
Pasha asked me to let her
take a few photos.
I said OK,
but no face in the photos.
Only hands
and the kitchen.
I just don’t know I’m here
because of the photos or the kitchen.
Pasha had fallen for her.
Couldn’t do anything about it.
Love is love.
He loved her madly.
Maryam had become all his life.
Pasha was justified
to fall for Maryam.
You couldn’t help falling
in love with Maryam
Any man would be in love
with Maryam.
No, Maryam didn’t
really do anything.
She didn’t dress gaudy
like some girls.
But she attracted everybody.
She had sort of insanity,
a kind of charisma,
that attracted everybody.
Whoever saw her
would come to like her.
I don’t believe it.
Unless the girl does something,
the boy will not follow her.
She has surely done something
that the boy went after her.
He wouldn’t for no reason.
It is not clear the relation
was a complete two-sided love.
Perhaps it was a one-sided love,
and the unconventional behaviour
of one hurt the other.
He was too much head
over heels to let her go.
He was going full throttle.
What should I say?
He loved her very much.
Everything was going on well
until Maryam
Maryam shouldn’t have
played with Pasha
She shouldn’t have done it
to him.
Cheating is cheating.
Maryam shouldn’t have
cheated on Pasha
Neither Pasha nor
I found it out.
Baroon caught her red-handed.
Accidently.
It wasn’t accidently.
Pasha didn’t want me to find out,
but how is that possible?
I went to see who he was.
Not once.
I saw them together a few times.
Madam, I told you
he doesn’t have time now.
And I said
it is very important.
Tell me what it is about.
Fax these.
- Hello.
- Hello.
The lady insists on seeing you.
Yes, I am at your disposal.
I need the money from this job.
Everybody needs the money
from this job.
My situation is different.
Whoever comes here
has a different situation.
Can I explain
my situation privately?
- You are Miss?
- Maryam.
- Maryam?
- Sabet.
Wait here.
I’ll be with you.
- Where is Pasha?
- Asleep.
- It isn’t the time to be asleep!
- He was tired, so he turned in.
- When did he come home?
- Nearly 3 or 4 in the morning.
- Where had he been?
- How do I know?
How are you?
See this.
What does he have?
Where did you find him?
Who is he?
Maryam’s fiancé.
Who is Maryam?
“Who is Maryam?”
You don’t know?
Where did he find her?
- Who told you to go to him?
- I wanted to.
- You shouldn’t have!
- But I wanted to.
I’ll delete these photos
and you will shut up.
You mustn’t do it.
What is it to you?
Even if you take 100 photos for Pasha,
he won’t leave her.
She is engaged.
How do you know
she is Maryam’s fiancé?
How do I know?
Who is she?
She is right.
Where are you taking them?
Don’t!
Pasha!
Pasha wouldn’t let go.
He wanted to take revenge
on both the boy and Maryam.
Roll down the window.
Yes?
You hit and run?
You ran over the kid.
Who did that?
You almost killed him.
- Did we hit anybody?
- You did.
Here it is.
We weren’t even moving
in that lane.
What are you doing?
I didn’t know
I was dealing with a gang.
How much do you want?
Shut up!
Filth bag!
Tell him who my father is!
Don’t ‘my father’ me!
Cos my father is this knife!
Either forget Maryam
or my knife will help you forget.
You can have Maryam.
My name is not Maryam.
He means your fiancée.
What will your father say
when he sees this?
What will he say?
What would you do
in my place?
I’m sorry.
Didn’t hear you.
I’m sorry like shit!
- Like shit?
- Like shit!
- Like what?
- Like shit!
Good!
What was it?
Shit!
I went to see who he was.
Shit!
Pasha took it out on Sa’eed.
But his relation with Maryam
was ruined.
I deleted the photos.
He didn’t have anything
to show to Maryam.
- Maryam!
- I don't want to see you.
Wait.
Let me explain.
Explain what?
Any idea what you
did to him, psycho?
What I did or you did?
You became his girlfriend or I did?
Their relation didn’t get
like before again.
Row after row.
He followed Maryam
in the street everywhere.
He quarrelled with everybody.
He’s become tetchy.
Until he disappeared suddenly.
We were really worried for him.
Everybody said something.
Someone said he’d seen him
sleeping in the street.
Someone said
he’d seen him in the terminal.
One day he came here.
I think it was at that time.
He wasn’t well at all.
He was sort of confused,
distracted.
He cried all the time.
As if he had taken refuge here.
MARYAM
He’d disappeared for a week
when we found out what had happened.
I was sitting right here.
Baba’ee
University Student
The girl and boy were sitting
over there under the tree,
when the girl screamed suddenly.
She screamed non-stop.
She started to run,
I was really shocked.
I didn’t know what to do.
At first I didn’t know
what had happened.
I found out later.
I was at the park washing my car
when I heard the scream.
Mr Nazari
Driver
I’m burning!
I’m burning!
You can’t imagine
what I went through...
In our patriarchal society,
the harms to the women
are definitely much deeper.
They are even more irreversible.
They are insulted more, they
are more exposed to danger,
and the possibility of legal
action is much less for them.
Naturally,
the society shows reaction.
The hurt burns to utter
something burning.
If you want to know how we are,
listen to what we say.
NO TO VIOLENCE
In such campaigns, you
must put away your feelings,
act with logic and wisdom,
and in the framework of the law.
Most acid attacks target women
Women are still considered
inferior to men.
A society without objection
is a dead society.
I can’t say it with certainty,
but during the time the suspect
was detained in this police station,
he cried so much that it was clear
he wasn’t mentally stable
I ran after him and he
ran to the end of the park.
Mr Asadi
Maize Seller
I took a shortcut and
faced him on the other side.
He was shocked.
He wanted to run away
and I tripped him.
He would’ve escaped
if I hadn’t.
We turned him in to the police.
They are all lies.
The suspect turned
himself in voluntarily.
Not that day.
Ten days after the incident.
He looked like vagrants and
we had no problem in arresting him.
Was it my fault or yours?
Did I want to do this?
You asked me to do it.
You wanted it.
Did I really want to do it?
Not you, she wanted it.
Yes, she made me do it.
- I’m not feeling well.
- Shut up!
I should’ve sit back and let him
take her away from me?
Shut up!
- I didn’t want to do it.
- Shut up!
- She made me do it.
- Shut up!
I shouldn’t have fallen in love
with her.
I didn’t make a mistake.
You did.
Everything was fine
before I fell in love.
It is your own fault.
Everything is my fault.
I am to blame.
You thought you could
tame her?
I thought I could tame her.
There are so many girls in town.
You mean she isn’t mine?
- Does she love you?
- Of course she does.
- How do you know?
- She told me she loved me.
If she doesn’t,
why must she lie to me?
What love?
What relationship?
They are imaginations of a psycho
with the psychos around him.
He’s repeated that to himself so much
he has believed it is love, a relationship.
I told him no on the first day.
Sorry I dragged you here.
I could send it to you.
But I wanted to see who
had written these in the bag.
You read them?
I was looking for your number
and saw them accidentally.
I started reading and I don't know
what happened I read them till the end.
I liked them very much.
What did you like about them?
The frankness.
I understand much better the
people you have written about,
than the people here.
Then why you made
an appointment here?
We’ll make an appointment
downtown next time.
Thank you for the bag.
I’ll be off.
I’ll pay at the door.
No, I’ll pay
because I was nosey.
As you wish.
Goodbye.
She didn’t open up.
And I liked that attitude of hers.
How did you find
here’s number?
I saw your number suddenly
in your writings.
Don’t call again.
I don’t mean harm.
Just called to ask
how you are doing.
You gave my bag.
No need to call again.
Sorry it got disconnected.
I paid the other time
and it got on my nerve.
Let’s go somewhere,
you pay, and I have fun.
I love the way she laughs!
Hello?
Did I insult you
that you hang up on me?
Do you hear me?
Hello?
Wild girl!
Don’t call again!
I won’t hear it.
When do we meet?
DON’T CALL!
Someone answers the phone.
It is a stalker.
Maryam!
Hello.
What?
You told me not to call
and I came!
Wait!
Please don’t go.
I want to talk to you.
For God's sake!
It is a matter of life and death!
- Get in and I’ll tell you.
- Say it here.
- Can’t be here.
- Get in.
-Say it here.
-Get in.
If you don’t,
I’ll blow the horn.
I will!
Thank you.
Fasten your seat belt.
Your perfume is nice.
I love you.
Is that
what you wanted to say?
I want you.
Do you know the meaning of
what you are saying?
I do.
I feel you.
I see you wherever I go.
You are with me.
Enough!
Pull over.
I want to get out.
I didn’t say anything bad.
Just my feeling, shouldn’t I?
No, don’t say it.
OK, I won’t.
I’m sorry.
No need to fight!
You took back your word
very quickly, coward.
The way you treat me scares me.
I don't know what to do.
- Your first time?
- What?
Your first time?
I fall in love?
- You were not to say it.
- Sorry!
- I won’t say it again.
- Little boy!
I was a boy.
I grew up
and became a man.
I grew beard too.
Most probably
you dye your own beard.
You like the colour?
Stop the car.
Remember Siyavash?
Which Siyavash?
The one you tried to save
from execution.
He was hanged.
He was my cousin.
Then why I never saw you there?
We are not noticeable!
I saw you
and fell for you.
- Thank you for giving me a lift.
- Welcome.
Don’t come late.
I don’t like waiting.
- Don’t talk to me like that.
- Sure!
Don’t come late.
The way she walks,
her manners
her look
whatever she did,
drew me to her.
I didn’t want it,
she did.
Why are you standing here?
I asked
why you are standing here.
To give you a lift.
What do you want from me?
You are looking for crooks?
I can show you the worse crims.
Worse crims?
Real criminals.
They are dwarfs.
I’ll take you to giants.
Underworld.
Want me to take you
to Earthworm?
Earthworm!
I pitied him.
A stupid pity.
My mistake started there.
Why she came with me
if she didn’t like me?
She wanted to tease me?
She wouldn’t have
if she didn’t want to tease you.
I’d just gone to take a few photos.
That’s all.
I wouldn’t have gone
if I had a little brain.
- It’s cool.
- Yes.
- Worse crims?
- Yes.
- You are worsest!
- Shut up!
Why she laughed
if she didn’t like me?
Why she laughed?
She laughed.
She laughed.
She laughed!
She laughed.
I made a mistake.
It wasn’t pity.
I was so stupid I thought
people could be changed.
When he did whatever I said,
I wanted to do something to correct him,
to teach him to behave.
That is all rubbish!
There are so many men
among my friends,in my workplace.
Men or women make
no difference to me.
We didn’t even take
each other’s hand.
I was only helping him
to forget me slowly.
And Sa’eed showed up again
in the middle of all my problems.
The relationship between Sa’eed
and me was so irrelevant...
...that it finished
before it even started.
A relation that we thought
could have a future.
In less than two months,
we didn’t have anything to tell each other.
We pretended we talked.
But when I found out
who his father was,
I couldn’t stand him
any more.
I finished with him but
Sa’eed wouldn’t let go.
He thought he could
convince me by talking.
He said. he was different
from his father.
But the more I looked at him,
the more I saw their similarities.
I was fed up
with his persistence.
He wouldn’t understand.
He’d become like this boy,
You had to tell him everything
I was exasperated.
After two months,
he asked to see me.
He wanted to tell me he would
leave his father because of me.
Because he is a thief,
a filth bag,
and an inside trader bastard!
If his father didn’t have
so many people’s money,
that monkey
would really love her?
Not to mention my money,
your money, people’s money.
I’m sure
that boy had changed her mind.
Otherwise,
Maryam loved me.
At least wait
when you hit!
Who is this goof you’ve
become friends with?
You don’t love him?
Of course you don’t.
He loves you?
Of course he does.
He isn’t a man
if he doesn’t.
Don’t be offended,
I’m not saying anything bad.
I say you must be careful
nobody will fall in love with you.
It is funny.
So many mottos,
no to violence.
I got angry and slapped her.
I hate myself.
He won’t let go.
- Do I stop?
- No, drive.
She didn’t answer me
or see me.
I’d become desperate.
A vagrant!
I got distant from him.
I was afraid of him.
I didn’t see him for some time.
I was almost forgetting him.
My mind was busy with
the family of a victim.
I was convincing them
not to request execution.
It’d become my dream
to convince someone to forgive.
It is my fault.
I don't know why I insisted
so much that day.
Maybe if I hadn’t insisted,
this wouldn’t have happened.
Maryam, go see him.
Poor boy is in love.
He wants to talk to you.
He promised if he saw you,
everything would be over.
You are his friend or mine?
I don't know
why you react so strangely.
See him
and get it done with.
Don’t you want everything
to be over?
She was right.
I didn’t see him
from that day on!
I told myself
to kill my wisdom.
Kill it!
Kill it!”
I wish I hadn’t gone that day.
I wish
I’d died.
Kill me.
Finish it.
What is this stupid game?
Game?
You played with me.
Would I come here if I
wanted to play with you?
You aren’t feeling well.
You don’t understand.
I couldn’t do it
even if I liked you.
Even if?
Suppose I do like you.
Do you?
I can’t!
- Shall I pour for you?
- No!
Why?
I’d love to sit before you,
stare at you,
and get drowned in you.
To your gaze...
...which is mine.
To your eyes
which are both beautiful.
- To your
- That’s enough!
Why are you hurting
yourself and me so much?
- Will you become mine?
- I belong to nobody.
Not even myself.
Even better!
Be mine then.
See?
You don’t understand.
That is what makes me sick
about you.
You don’t understand.
OK!
So,
we’ll say goodbye.
You want to drink that too?
It is goodbye, right?
You want to have us arrested?
I’ll ask for the last time.
- Will you be mine?
- You are insane!
Either mine or nobody’s!
I’m burning!
I’m burning!
Her skin came off
layer by layer.
The smell of her wound
is still in my mind.
Yes.
I provided the acid for him.
If I hadn’t,
someone else would.
But he wasn’t going to splash it.
He said
he only wanted to scare her.
He said he wanted to show Maryam
the depth of his love.
He burned her heart.
He destroyed me too.
I’m ready to give my life
so her face returns.
Seeing, reading, and
writing were all my life.
I am dead.
I am buried alive now.
Everything ended so easily?
Worse than all Sa’eed!
Despite all his claim that
he loved Maryam so much,
he didn’t visit Maryam
even once.
What has it got to do with me?
I don’t understand.
How can you say that?
She didn’t like to see me.
And I don’t want to see her.
Especially now after this incident
when nobody knows what it is about.
In this situation, you are
worried about your position?
I don't know Maryam.
I’ve seen her only twice
all my life,
because of the loan she
had got from the company.
She invited us one or two times
to get time to return the loan later.
I didn’t accept because
I didn’t know her,
and I said
I wasn’t a shark.
I told the guys to give her time
according to the regulations,
so there wouldn’t be
any trouble later.
Anything else they say
is nonsense.
Maybe they wanted
to frame my father.
What?
My father has not embezzled
a few hundred billion.
Even if he had,
what is it to you?
He surely had the guts
to do it.
I don't want you
to censor these.
All people who boast,
if they were in my father’s shoes,
they’d have taken enough already
and left.
Some made accusations
but couldn’t prove them.
And some sued
but couldn’t do anything.
Thank God both my father’s
and my accounts are clear.
We are both
soldiers of this country.
And everybody knows I have
been engaged for two years.
Excuse me?
What if the two of them
were in it together?
There must be something that
he splashed acid on her.
My soul and body
burnt together.
I am burning inside
but I am alive.
I breathe.
I die but I am alive.
I burn again 100 times a day,
but I am alive again.
I am in hell.
In a world like a slide
where you are falling all the time.
It is night, it is day,
but is it is still dark.
You sleep and get up,
but it is still dark.
Why nobody wakes me up
from this nightmare?
Put yourself in her shoes
for a moment.
Why she shouldn’t take?
Say revenge.
Call it whatever you want.
I won’t forgive him.
The former Maryam is dead.
I don’t understand what
she used to say any more.
I want to do something nobody
dares to splash acid again.
I totally agree.
I agree.
I am not to decide.
Maryam must say lex talionis
should be done or not.
I’m not against
punishing Pasha.
But I don't want another wounded
and another ugliness added to the world.
Why do you think
everybody thinks like you?
Why do you want to egg on
the society?
JUSTICE FOR MARYAM
I don't want to torture him.
I just don’t want
to let anybody else do it.
I want him to realise...
...the crime he has done
is worse than murder.
I wanted to change him.
If it didn’t happen that way,
this way.
WHERE IS MY FACE?
It’s become so complicated
that the main issue, Maryam,
has been lost in the process.
Lex talionis.
The court verdict for the complaint of
Ms Maryam Farnami is lex talionis.
Mr Enayat
Judge
I beg the authorities not to
be contented with...
...an organ for an organ punishment
in this case,
but to give him the maximum sentence
so this filth will be wiped.
They must be killed.
No, who says lex talionis is
an inhumane and brutal act?
That is not so.
Les talionis is a reaction.
As the Quran puts it,
it ensures life in society.
Lex talionis has been ordered
to maintain people’s security...
...in the society
against the criminals.
There are punishment and retaliation
in all educational systems in the world.
In case of Ms Maryam Farnami,
she could request blood money,
but she didn’t
and she insists on lex talionis.
It is her right
and the verdict will be carried out.
Anybody can splash acid in the face
of a girl in the name of love,
and then nobody
will tell him anything?
Can you imagine what
has happened to her?
Surgery after surgery.
Going from this to that doctor.
The pains apart, just close
your eyes and imagine...
...you won’t be able
to open them again.
I miss seeing a simple frame,
a doorframe
an empty glass.
All human rights campaigns agree
Maryam must get her right.
Nobody must deprive another
human of the right to live.
I know all that.
They are no use.
Even if they didn’t let it,
I would go to him.
I really don’t know.
Everybody is shocked.
I hope the society will not think
Pasha became a criminal...
...because he grew up
in an orphanage.
That is not so.
Many good and useful people
grew up in the same orphanage;
people who didn’t even see
their families;
no father,
no mother.
And many criminals came from
big houses and important families.
This lex talionis
will be done by surgery,
due to the complications
and difficulties involved.
According to the law,
the length and width of the cut
must be equal in lex talionis for wounds.
The verdict has been sent to
Verdict Administration Dept...
...to be carried out under the supervision
of the Forensics Office.
It is very hard
to find someone to do it,
because the medical society has made
an oath to cure pain not inflict pain.
If I don’t do it,
someone else will.
It is God’s order.
It must be carried out.
It is really hard and not
everybody can do it.
Observing equal cut is very important
in the lex talionis of the organ.
If you make the slightest mistake,
you must pay blood money.
It is a millimetre job and depends
on different parameters such as...
...the amount of the acid,
acid’s pH value,
how the acid has been poured,
the thickness of the culprit’s skin,
how the patient should be treated
after splashing the acid.
The total burn on the face
is 9%.
Two eyes, one nose, one mouth,
two eyebrows, two cheeks, two ears.
According to the judge’s decision,
we do lex talionis on two eyes.
What are you afraid of?
Let them blind you.
You think you are seeing now?
I got blind the moment
Maryam rejected me.
If they are going to blind you,
who can be better than Maryam?
I have no objection if
Maryam wants to blind me.
- You still love her?
- Of course I do.
I love her.
I’m ready to die for her.
- With that face?
- The way she is.
- Will you marry her?
- I’d love to.
If Maryam agrees,
I’ll marry her tomorrow.
Maryam was justified.
Pasha had blinded her.
We had to convince Maryam
to withdraw her complaint.
But how?
Maryam, I’ve come to ask
you to be forgiving.
Go out!
- Maryam, forgive
- Someone takes her out!
Maryam!
I swear you to
whatever you believe in,
to whatever you worship!
He made a big mistake.
He is sorry.
Forgive him!
I’ll do whatever you say.
Maryam!
Forgive him.
Be merciful!
He did wrong.
- Have mercy on him.
- Did he have mercy on me?
Take my eyes, but not his.
Forgive him, for Quran’s sake!
I’ll do whatever you say.
Forgive what?
Forgive what?
Whatever we did,
she didn’t want to see us.
She went for lex talionis
after two months.
- Where is he?
- They’ll bring him now.
In the Name of God.
My girl!
I know lex talionis is your right,
but be forgiving.
In the verse God Almighty
has recognised lex talionis as a right,
He has confirmed that waiving
the right to lex talionis...
...is a lofty deed and
will be rewarded otherworldly.
- Forgive him.
- I won’t.
I want him to be punished.
I know you are
in a hard condition.
I know well
all the things you said.
I want to do the lex talionis myself.
It is my right.
Where is he?
Where is that jerk now?
Where is he?
Let go of my hand.
Don’t you want to do
lex talionis today?
Let me do it.
Where has he gone?
Is he here?
I want to do myself.
I want to set him on fire.
I want him to burn!
What do you mean,
“Calm down”?
Look at me!
Let go of me!
Let go!
By God I still love you.
Calm down.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes.
Calm down.
Open your eyes.
Calm down.
Water.
Can I have water?
You’ll burn more
if you move.
I forgive him!
FORGIVENESS IN
PLACE OF REVENGE
MARYAM, THANK YOU
MARYAM, WE LOVE YOU
Only a great woman
is capable of such courage.
She gave us a big lesson
with what she did.
The lesson of forgiveness,
kindness, sacrifice, faith.
And nobody knew
the name of the mournful pigeon...
...that had flown away from
the hearts was faith.
The greatest forgiver in the world
is God Almighty.
In the name of God.
The Gracious, the Merciful.
The only thing left for me
was forgiveness.
When I said I would forgive him,
I thought about myself.
I didn’t want to think about
someone else.
Whether he gets blind or not
makes no difference to me any more,
but forgiving him or not
does.
True she waived her right
and forgave him,
according to Islamic Penal Law,
as the crime has disrupted
law and order in society,
and there is the fear of encouragement
to the culprit or other persons,
the defendant is sentenced
to five years imprisonment,
the maximum sentence
stated in the law.
The defendant's other charges will
be dealt with in Criminal Court
What are you thinking about?
You.
Forgive me,
but I still love her.
Isn’t it a pity to waste time
talking so much about that person?
The foreigners will see this film
and will say...
...the people in our country
are all like that.
No, we have doctors,
engineers, good people.
There is an old well-digger.
He has been earning honest money
for his family for 50 years...
...from the bottom of the wells.
And his children
are all good people.
Why you don’t make films
about them?
I have a fruit shop.
I haven’t raised the price of tomato
for a few years.
You just want to sully.
The foreigners are not in love
with you and me.
Only our miseries
are attractive to them.
Pathology is different
from besmirch.
I want to criticise you too.
You are angry
with something.
In your previous film I’m not Angry!,
you extend it to the whole society.
Why you don’t see so much love,
beauty, passion, and joy in the society?
It is very unfair.
On the other side of the world,
a youth takes a gun,
goes to a school,
and kills schoolchildren.
They don’t hide the news,
and bring the killer to the television,
analyse him, and find the
roots for his action.
And nobody says
this is sullying.
They give education.
They try to prevent the repetition of
the action by education.
Nobody erases the problem.
The earth is like a balloon.
It will burst
wherever you prick.
Holocaust, Hiroshima, Nagasaki,
the American twin towers,
the chemical bombing of
Halabja and Sardasht,
they are all wounds
inflicted on the earth.
The two or three-year-old kid
who was playing in Sardasht or Halabja...
...has not been able to breathe
normally for decades.
I announce here
we are worried.
Give us the right to be worried
because of the publication of...
...such social issues
in such a manner.
Be whatever you want.
Just be humans.
See humans.
By God we are the children
of this country too.
You must support
a youth like me.
What are you saying?
Shut up!
Never mind.
Shit!
Shut up!
I think Lantouri is not
a good name for your film,
because this film is the story of
Maryam and her forgiveness,
not that boy and Lantouri Gang.
Maryam waived her right.
Forgiving was not Maryam’s duty.
It was her kindness.
After numerous surgeries,
one of her eyes can see the light.
The doctors say the sight of that eye
will return little by little.
God sees it.
I want to get up.
I want to live.
I can persuade the victims’ families more
easily... to withdraw their complaint.
