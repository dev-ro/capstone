Why?
That is the question
people ask me most.
Why? For what? Why do
you walk on the wire?
Why do you tempt fate?
Why do you risk death?
But I don't think of it this way.
I never even say this word death.
Okay, I said it once,
or maybe 3 times just
now, but watch.
I will not say it again. Instead
I use the opposite word.
Life.
For me, to walk on
the wire is life.
Life.
So, picture with me. It's 1974,
New York City, and I
am in love with two buildings. Two
towers. Or as everyone calls them,
the twin towers of
the World Trade Center.
They call to me, these towers.
They stir something inside me,
and inspire in
me... a dream.
My dream is to hang a wire between
those twin towers, and walk on it.
Of course, this is impossible.
Not to mention illegal.
So why attempt the impossible?
Why follow your dream?
I cannot answer these
questions. Not with words.
But I can show you
how it happened.
So we must go back in
time and across the ocean.
Because my love affair with these
towers did not begin in New York.
In case you couldn't tell,
I'm not from here. No.
My story begins in another of the
world's most beautiful cities.
So now picture Paris.
Here I am, a self-proclaimed
wirewalker nobody cares about.
Surviving as a troubador,
performing in the streets
I created a character with a top hat.
I wear only black.
I teach myself to draw a
perfect circle on the ground,
and within this circle I
never speak. Not one word.
The circle is my domain. I don't
allow even half a toe inside it.
And if spectators continue
to violate my sacred space
I must employ
more drastic measures
I perform for anyone who'll watch
me, and the people love it.
Men, women, young,
old. Everyone.
Except of course
the police
I don't believe in
getting a permit.
But no matter where I was
going or what I was doing,
I was always
searching, looking for
the perfect place
to hang my wire.
[Speaking French]
Suddenly, I freeze.
The pain in my tooth is gone.
The magazine has an article with
an illustration of the towers.
They're not finished, but the
magazine says once they are,
they will be the tallest
in the world.
And with this
tiny pencil stroke
My fate was sealed.
This was the beginning
of my dream.
The first time I saw a wirewalker,
I was 8 years old.
The circus had
come to my town,
and it featured the Omankowski
family troupe, one of the
greatest wirewalking
troupes in the world.
The white devils.
And I taught myself to
walk on that rope.
It turned out I had a talent for
climbing, balancing, even juggling.
But I wanted
to know more.
[Speaking French.]
This is how I met Rudy
Omankowski senior,
The patriarch of the White Devils
wirewalking family,
who everyone called
Papa Rudy.
He never said exactly where he was from.
He was certainly not French.
Papa Rudy was a supreme wirewalker,
acrobat and juggler.
And in that moment I
suppose he saw something in me.
Philippe!
[Speaking French]
- Oh. I speak English.
- Okay.
Today,
you'll learn how to
make an entrance.
You need to learn
how to 'compliment'.
A 'compliment' is a silent message;
an order to the audience to
pay attention, and after
the performance
a 'compliment' is also
an offering of gratitude.
No, Philippe.
That was terrible.
You're doing too much.
Do nothing.
Now try again.
No. I told you to do nothing.
You're still doing too much.
You look like a coward.
The audience must always
feel you are in control.
Stop trying so hard.
Do nothing. Do it again.
Where's your respect?
You didn't do anything.
- You said to do nothing.
- Yes. Nothing on the outside.
Inside, in your heart,
you must salute.
In my heart?!
The performer must
have an honest respect
and gratitude for
the audience.
Why should I respect the
audience? It's me on the wire.
You will salute the audience,
and pay respect.
Unless you understand that, you'll
never perform in the circus.
Good. I don't want to
perform in the circus.
I'm not some ridiculous circus
clown, I am an artist.
So just like that, Papa Rudy threw
my artistic ass out into the street.
And a short time later...
[Speaking French]
The carrots were cooked. There
was nothing left to do,
so I set off on my way.
I didn't even know what I
was looking for, but
I figured I might
find it in Paris.
[Speaking French]
[Speaking French]
I'd be much obliged if you could
mosey along. This is private.
Well shut my mouth! We thought
you were putting on a show!
Well it ain't.
- This here's for y'all.
- Well thank you kindly.
Oh, I love your English. It
sounds so American.
- [Speaks French]
- I think I like better the English.
- [Speaks French]
- Yes, I certainly prefer the English.
Listen, juggler. You stole my
best audience in weeks.
And for what?
Some cheap stunt?
I'm sorry, but people
love my high wire.
You call that
a high wire?
That's the lowest high
wire I've ever seen.
That's right, but it's because the
two tallest trees in the square
were in your
performance space
and I would never invade the
space of another artist.
It's about to rain.
Hey, angry
street musician.
I would like to
make an arrangement.
I'll only play in that square
when you're not there.
Oh, that's every weekend
and every 2nd Tuesday.
Okay. Deal.
My name is Philippe.
- Annie.
- Annie is a nice name.
- Why all the English?
- Ah, because I'm
practicing. I'm going
to New York.
Ah, New York. That's
very exciting.
- Yes. Maybe you'll come with me.
- Ha ha. Maybe
I like how you sing.
It's very good.
You weren't listening to me sing.
You were playing with fire on the rope.
No, before that. I
was here earlier.
Maybe you didn't see me, but I saw
you, and heard you sing.
- It was beautiful.
- Well thank you.
May I buy you
a glass of wine?
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- I'll make you an arrangement.
If you let me buy you a glass of
wine, I'll never hang my rope
anywhere in the Latin
Quarter ever again.
You don't give
up, do you.
No. I'm very...
persistent.
My dream.
- And this is you.
- Yes.
To be the most glorious
highwire walker in history.
And how high must the
wire be to reach such glory?
Over 100 stories high.
And where do
cables like this go?
These are not trees.
Two magnificent towers.
100 meters taller than
the Eiffel tower itself.
I see.
What do you think?
I don't know.
It looks so...
Beautiful?
Beautiful, yes.
And dangerous, and...
completely insane.
Are you a madman?
Yes, I am mad with this. It is my dream.
Then if it's your
dream you must do it.
- Even if everyone says I'm mad?
- Don't care about what people think.
But I care what you think.
- I got lucky.
- Yes?
- Yes.
- Want to know what I think of you?
- No.
- No?
- Not even a little bit?
- No.
OK, but I'm going to
tell you anyway.
You can tell me but
I won't care.
I know a place where there
are two beautiful trees.
I didn't realize it, but Annie had
become my first accomplice.
- Annie.
- Yes?
I was thinking you should
come up here with me.
No, I don't think so.
It would be your
baptism of the wire.
- No.
- Come on, Annie. Trust me.
Okay.
And there were two
beautiful trees growing
in the park of
Annie's art school,
and she arranged for me
to hang my wire there.
It was perfect. I could practice
every day, and see Annie as well.
Then one day, while
I was on my wire,
I was approached by a very
serious-looking young man.
[Speaking French]
- Jean-Louis, do you speak English?
- Yes, why?
I must practice, because
I'm going to America.
- To perform?
- Exactly.
But my performance
will not just be a show.
- It will be a coup.
- A coup?
Yes. I intend to
rig my wire...
in secret, on the most
spectacular stage in the world.
And then without warning...
I'll appear, and will
perform my surprise:
An illegal wire walk.
If it works, it'll be the
artistic coup of the century.
Wow! Well you, my friend, can
see my photographs anytime.
- They are rebellious.
- So you're not just a
photographer, but
an anarchist as well?
All artists are anarchists
to some degree.
Don't you agree?
Yes. And you, my
artist anarchist friend...
can be my... official
photographer.
This is how I made friends with
Jean-Louis, my second accomplice.
If that happened during your coup, it'd
be the artistic disaster of the century.
I need to know more.
[Speaking French]
I need you to teach me
how to rig a high wire.
What for? You're a
street juggler.
I need to know how to
tie the correct knots.
I need to know the kind of cable
to use. The weight, the thickness...
- the load strength.
- So,
You want me to just
give you my secrets.
Secrets I've spent
a lifetime learning.
Secrets I've only
given to my sons.
You want me to just
hand them over to you.
I can pay you. I have money.
I don't care what it costs.
Meet me at the
circus. At sunrise.
Bring your
juggling money.
Place the blocks between
the cable and the mast.
Okay.
The blocks act
as buffers,
So when the mast flexes,
the wire won't snap.
And always, always check
the rigging yourself.
Never step on a wire if you've not
checked all the rigging yourself.
- Capisce?
- Okay.
There was this great Polish
guy, a wire walker. Roman.
He said he could tell when a cable
as at the correct tension
through his arse
and though his ear.
Under the ring, through the ring,
lock it off, tighten and... pay.
- You give me broken money!
- It's fine.
So Papa Rudy let me
travel with his troupe.
Of course, I never
did any performances.
But any time the big top was empty,
I would practice on the wire.
Most wirewalkers
die when they arrive.
They think they've arrived,
but they're still on the wire.
If you have
three steps to do,
Take those
steps arrogantly.
If you think you're
invincible, you'll die.
This one I give to
you for free.
A few weeks later, I did my
first official public walk,
in a tiny little village, so small
it's not even on a map.
But the mayor of this village, every
spring he puts on a festival,
and Papa Rudy convinced
him to hire me to do a walk
over this little lake, which
was more like a swamp.
- OK?
- Through your arse and feet, you tell me.
Annie came, and set up
a turntable for music,
and Jean-Louis came
to take pictures.
And so I began my performance.
Everything was going very well.
But then I started to hear these
murmurs, and laughing.
Turns out there was also a
fishing contest that afternoon,
on this lake (more
like a swamp), and
these fishermen are drinking wine,
yelling insults, laughing at me...
while I'm trying
to work!
Now working on the wire is
as much mental as physical.
If you lose your concentration,
you lose your balance!
Philippe!
So here I am, in the mud to my knees,
doing the Papa Rudy 'complement'.
This was my
first performance.
A failure!
And after this...
I didn't feel
so good.
Then one day, I was walking along
the Seine, feeling sorry for myself,
when I looked up and saw
the towers of Notre Dame.
And I said, "This is where
I must put my wire."
This is how I will
redeem myself.
And so, under the cover of
darkness and with a false key,
Jean-Louis and I
sneak into the cathedral.
I tie a fishing line to one
of my juggling balls,
and throw it to the other side,
where Jean-Louis is waiting.
Then we attach the
line to a small rope,
and pass it between the towers.
Then we pass a larger rope,
Then we attach the larger
rope to the steel cable.
So Jean-Louis and
I stay up all night,
installing the wire between
these two ancient towers,
And when the first tourists
start to arrive in the morning...
I begin.
And I succeed. I perform my first
surprise illegal highwire walk.
This was also the first time I get
the taste of this sensation;
this feeling that I'm crossing
into a truly different world.
And I was redeemed.
Or so I thought.
Parisians know nothing but contempt.
They refuse to appreciate beauty.
Every other country; Germany, Spain,
England - even Russia - salutes me.
They call me a maestro, a
valiant young poet.
But no, not
the French!
They call me a
delinquent, a vandal.
Look.
This is a sign.
The same paper as my Notre Dame
story. This is providence.
They're almost finished. The lower
floors are already occupied.
Annie, we need to pack.
- They'e enormous!
- Yes.
They're monstruous.
They're a lot taller
than I imagined.
It's absurd.
Completely absurd.
It's not real.
These towers
aren't scaleable.
They just rise and never
stop. It's not human.
It's over. It's over.
It's finished.
- What's over?
- The coup! My dream's destroyed!
You see this monster?!
Beasts! Beasts!
- Calm down!
It's not possible!
There's no sign of possibility;
nothing telling me it can be done!
Yo. How ya doin'?
Thare are stairs going up.
Go back to the hotel.
If I'm not back in five hours,
look for me at the police station.
I make my way to the top.
Nobody stops me.
I find myself standing on an
island, floating in midair
on the edge
of the void.
Of course, I automatically
look across at the other tower.
But then, I have
to dare to look...
down.
Now I think I know the void. I'm a
wirewalker. The void is my domain.
Yes. Well not
this void.
But still I gather the
courage to whisper.
I whisper so the
demons won't hear me.
Its impossible.
But I'll do it.
English. Only English. We must
sound like New Yorkers.
Your so-called coup
is a ridiculous joke.
- There. In English.
- I have it all planned out.
Who are you kidding? You have no
idea what's on the other roof.
You don't know when the crews
arrive, or when they quit.
You've no idea of the distance between
the towers, or how to anchor cavalettis.
How? There's no place to
attach them to the facade.
And by the way, how long did
it take you to build this model?
Oh come on. It's
beautiful, huh?
- What are cavalettis?
- These guy-wires.
Papa Rudy calls them cavalettis.
They stabilize the walk cable.
The walk cable.
So how will you pass the
cable across the void?
As we did at Notre Dame.
We start with a fishing line,
attached to a rope that's
attached to a cable.
And how do we pass the fishing
line between the towers?
Yes, it's too far to throw the
juggling ball. But I was thinking
we could get a radio-
controlled airplane,
and fly the line across.
It will be fantastic.
It takes years to learn to fly an
airplane. Do you understand that?
We must accomplish this!
The towers are almost buit!
We're running out of time!
I need you to help me pull this
off. Think if we succeed!
This could be the most
audacious work of art ever!
Audacious?!
It's madness!
Yes, it's madess. No one in
his right mind
would attempt this. But
that's why I must do it.
Because it's never done. And
yes, I admit, I'm mad.
- Yes?
- Yes, I'm mad!
[Speaking French]
You love me because I'm mad!
I'm insane! Totally crazy!
I have to go. I'll
figure out
- how to get a wire across.
- Yes!
You figure out how to
anchor the cavalettis.
- Do we have a deal?
- Deal.
The cavalettis cannot
be vertical.
They must be horizontal;
parallel to the walk cable.
- Parallel?
- It won't be pretty,
but it'll keep the
cable from swaying.
And you must use three bolts
on the cavaletti clamps, not two.
A span this wide will put tremendous
pressure on the brace plates.
When you walk, your weight
could crack a bolt.
And wood. You must remember to put
wood blocks between the wire
and the building struts.
That way, when the
building breathes,
the wood will break, but the wire
won't explode and tear you in half.
Okay.
Wood.
Also, here's what you
will do, Philippe:
You'll wear a safety belt under your
costume, attached to a safety line,
connected to a carabiner.
A safety line? A carabiner?
I won't do this walk
with a safety line!
From that height it will be invisible!
No one will have any idea!
And what do I do when I get
to the first cavaletti?
You're a performer. You kneel down
on the wire. You unhook from one
side and clip it on the other.
They'll think you're saluting.
- This I will never do!
- So why'd you come here?
Because you know so much!
You tell me I'm wrong?
No! Because I need you to tell
me how to rig this wire,
not do a funny walk,
like a coward!
He does not comprehend
what I'm trying to do.
His highwire and my highwire
have nothing in common.
Go talk to him.
- Do I need to?
- Yes. Go talk to him.
- Go and apologize.
- I will not apologize!
Yes you will. You have no
choice. You know that.
Look, Papa Rudy.
I'm sorry,
but if I do the walk
with the safety line,
it becomes
meaningless.
Philippe, my sons are
consummate wirewalkers.
But I'd never allow them to attempt
such a walk without a safety line.
Yes, but you. Would you walk
with a safety line?
Yars ago, when you started
to teach me in this house,
I was a stupid little kid,
and I never listened to you.
But you told me something
I will always remember.
You said, "You can
not lie on stage;
"The audience always knows
what's in your heart."
I think I
understand now.
You know,
Philippe...
what you're doing, I may
not understand it...
But it's...
it's...
something.
Something
beautiful.
It was my
grandfather's.
You'll need this.
And you'll
need this.
Now my secrets
are our secrets.
Thank you.
Faster. Stronger.
Faster.
Stronger.
I'm trying!
You are the terrible hurricane winds
that howl between the towers!
Hello! How
are you?
Hello Hello.
This is my good
friend Jean-Francois.
He wants to be an
accomplice in the coup.
He comes in search
of adventure.
[Speaking French]
Jeff! An English name!
I like this!
Welcome, Jeff. Welcome
to the coup.
Unfortunately, Jeff
doesn't speak English.
[Speaking French]
6 times 6 is
36 for example.
- Ah, so his English isn't bad.
- Yes. But only numbers.
He teaches high-
school mathematics.
He's also...
He's also terrified
of heights.
Perfect.
I'm terrified
at algebra.
[Speaking French]
Tell me, what is 81
divided by 27?
- Three.
- Exactly.
[Speaking French]
Now what is
11 times ten?
- 110.
- Exactly.
[Speaking French]
Hey, guys. I belive I've
kept my part of the bargain.
What is it, a
bow and arrow?
OK, it's not as sensational
as a radio-controlled airplane,
but it's a
lot quieter.
It works!
It works!
So now I have enough money, I have my
accomplices, I have somewhat of a plan.
The only thing left
was selecting a date.
It had to be before
the weather turned cold,
and before the towers
were completed.
- So I chose August 6th.
- I choose August 6th.
That's three months
from today.
Jeff and Jean-Louis fly to
New York at the end of July.
Meanwhile, we start to look
for American accomplices.
So...
August 6th.
Polypropylene ropes, hemp ropes, block
and tackle with three sheaves,
block and tackle
with single sheaf,
slings, steel wire,
.25 inch cable,
pulley plugs, construction
gloves, monkey wrenches,
a tape measure and a
balancing pole in four sections.
And what's
all this for?
I'm going to hang a wire between the
World Trade Center towers and walk on it.
Huh! Go walk.
Next!
As soon we got back to New York,
I started my spy work.
I went to the towers every day,
sometimes at 6 a.m.
And every day I'd wear
a different disguise.
I took photos of everything, and notes
on every inch of the towers.
As you know. The north tower has been
completely finished for two years,
and the south tower is
completed up to the 80th floor.
- Both towers are open for business.
- Mr Tozzoli, excuse me.
I'm from the magazine l'Architecte.
Could you please tell me
the exact distance between the
north corner of the South Tower
and the south corner
of the North Tower?
What?
The exact distance
between the towers.
Lou?
140 feet.
I rode the elevators. The local,
the express to the
upper sky lobby,
the express to
the lower sky lobby,
I took hundreds of rides.
I spied on the maintenance men,
the loading docks, I watched
the trucks as they made their
deliveries, I noted what time
they arrived, how long they stayed,
how much paperwork was exchanged.
My best disguise was that of an architect.
I wore a tie and carried a blueprint,
and tried to look important. They
gave me access to everything.
Philippe, that looks really bad. Maybe
you should go to the hospital.
- And get it stiched.
- No, it'll be fine.
Look at the date.
The coup is three weeks away, and
Jean-Louis and Jeff arrive next week.
And I still have no access
to the North Tower roof.
You'll be able to walk on
the wire with that foot?
Yes, it'll heal by then. But what
am I going to do tomorrow?
How can I continue my spy work
with this ruined foot?
- Do you need crutches?
- No, I don't need...
Hey, yes! Crutches!
- Let me get that door for you.
- Oh, thank you.
Yey, let me help you
with them crutches.
- There you go, sir. Express elevator.
- Thank you.
I hope you heal up soon.
I'll feel much better
in a few weeks.
- What floor?
- 85, please.
Pardon me, but may I ask,
what are you doing here?
You don't belong here.
Yes. In fact
I'm quite right.
You don't belong
here at all,
do you... Philippe.
I knew it! Philippe Petit,
the daredevil wirewalker.
I saw you in Paris, on
the Notre Dame.
- Oh yes, yes.
- Wow.
The cops had no idea
what to do with you.
They never do.
- Barry. Barry Greenhouse.
- Hello, sir.
That's my name. Yeah.
So you'll be performing
here in New York?
- Yes, Yes. Do you work here?
- Yes.
White Insurance.
This man works
on the 82nd floor.
This could be very important, if
I can somehow seduce him into
becoming an accomplice. He
works in the North Tower.
He has access to the stairwell,
and the North Tower roof.
Wait! Barry!
One moment!
So Annie and I
invite him to dinner.
I bring my book of spy work,
and my Notre Dame clippings,
which he'd already witnessed, so
he knew I was serious.
And little by little I
paint him a picture.
And when the
sun comes up,
I walk.
Well it's certainly illegal,
that's for sure.
And extremely subversive, not to mention
dangerous. This is something only a
twisted, antisocial, anarchistic,
pissed-off malcontent would have anything to do with.
You have your inside man!
Philippe!
Welcome. Welcome, Jeff.
Very good. How
are you?
- My friend!
- Hey.
- So there we are.
- Wow.
This could be a disaster. Why are we
waiting for night to climb to the roof?
In the day we're more
likely to run into people.
But at night we have
no excuse to be there.
During the day, we'll
run into people
who'll ask where
we're going.
During the day you say, "I'm going to 'X'
office," but at night you have no excuse.
[Speaking French]
And what about
the guard?
There's only one guard. At night he stays
on the floors under construction.
So there's no
problem avoiding him.
- He never goes to the roof.
- Philippe,
- Philippe, where are you going?
- We need an interphone.
This is what you want.
- You want a walkie-talkie.
- No, I want an interphone.
- Like this one, with a wire.
- This one?
- Yes.
- This one here?
Yes, please.
You don't want that.
The wire's old-fashioned. What
you want... look at this.
- Wireless, eh?
- No, I want this interphone.
Buddy, you're not listening to me.
I'm trying to do you a favour.
This thing is discontinued, which
means I can't get you a warranty.
I don't care. I want this
one, with the wire.
Please
- Yes. Whatever you want.
- Thank you.
- You're the boss.
- Okay.
[Speaking French]
Oh, you thought you were the only ones
who spoke French in New York?
It's okay, by the way.
[Speaking French]
I say we invite
him to dinner.
- I'm Philippe.
- Jean-Pierre.
JP in America.
Welcome to Fisher Industrial
Fence Company of New Jersey.
- Looks real. Who made it?
- It'a long story.
- I bet. So do I get a job title?
- Yes. You've lived here the longest.
- You're Personnel Director.
- Cool. I like that.
- What do I have to do?
- Find more accomplices.
I got just the guy.
I can help with the wire.
I'm unbelievable at tying knots.
Worked on a shrimp boat.
Yeah, man. Count
me in, too.
Especially if the wire's
really... high. Get it?
You get it! Really high!
Why the World Trade towers?
Everbody hates those ugly boxes.
They're like two big filing cabinets.
You know what? Why not climb
the Chrysler Building, huh?
That would be a trip, right?
[Speaking French]
Tomorrow. The coup
is on for tomorrow.
Tomorrow is the big day.
You all know the plan.
The workers arrive at 7 a.m.,
So I must be on the wire
at 6 a.m. You're not listening.
Why is nobody listening to
me? Are you paying attention?
[Speaking French]
We've gone over the
plan 20 times already.
Well here comes number 21.
At 2 p.m. we load
the van. JP drives.
We drop Jean-Louis, Annie
and Albert at the North Tower.
You rendezvous with Barry.
He hides you on his floor
until he can sneak you up
the stairwell to the roof.
The rest of us - that's you, JP,
you, Jeff and you, David -
in our worker disguises we bring
up the cable and equipment
in the construction elevator.
We should be able to
reach the 82nd floor.
When the coast is clear,
as fast as we can,
We bring everything to the
roof and start rigging.
By midnight we're finished.
You hear me? At midnight!
This gives me time to sneak over to the
North Tower and check the rigging.
I must have time to check the
rigging on both towers.
Then at dawn - 6 a.m. -
I take my first step.
- Philippe.
- Yes.
- I think we shoud wait.
- No!
[Speaking French]
The carrots are cooked.
Cooked carrots?
What's that about?
French. Culinary metaphor.
It's a country with 365 different types
of cheese, one for each day of the year,
so of course they use a
vegetable metaphor.
[Speaking French]
The die is cast. There's no
going back now.
Guys, what're we doing here?
Listen, what we're doing is cool,
but I'd rather
not go to jail.
Especially not because some French
guy is obsessed with vegetables.
That's a buzz-kill, man.
The man is obviously crazy.
Are we just here to watch him die? Does
he even know how to walk a tightrope?
He knows how to walk a wire,
that's not the problem.
The problem is,
he's losing his mind.
He might be losing his mind,
but he won't give up.
He never gives up.
He just needs our help.
I think he can do this,
It would be very... beau?
Beautiful.
Oh, yeah. It would be
very... beautiful.
It was the night before the coup,
and of course I couldn't sleep.
I'd forgotten something very important.
I'd forgotten to nail shut the coffin.
Actually, there was no coffin. It was
the crate holding the cable.
But in my mind I had changed
this crate into a coffin.
What are you doing? You'll
wake the whole neighborhood!
- I forgot to shut the coffin.
- Stop calling it that!
- A coffin's what this may be.
- That's not funny! What's wrong with you?
- You have a death wish or something?
- Don't say this word!
Never say this word!
Come on. Death, coffin, die,
it's all the same thing.
Why are you doing this? Why
are you suddenly against me?
Against you? No one
is more supportive!
Then why do you
say this word?
Why put this in my head on the night
before my most dangerous work?
- Why are you so uncaring?
- Uncaring?
- You're the most selfish, arrogant-
- Yes, I'm arrogant! I have to be!
To walk on the wire,
to command the wire.
And what about your
partners, your accomplices?
You don't offer them a simple
thank you in appreciation!
- They know I appreciate them!
- Do they.
Yes! You want me to go in
there now and say thank you?
I can wake them up and
say, "Thank you, everybody."
- Just go to bed. You're exhausted.
- Annie.
My head is full of doubts.
I don't know if...
When I confront the void, when
it's time to step on the wire,
I don't know if I'll be able
to take my first step.
Your heart will tell
you what to do.
Annie.
You're the only one who
really knows me.
It's because of you that I can do
this walk. You give me the strength,
the ability. Without
you I couldn't do it.
You'll be fine.
Everybody wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!
There's something
I have to tell you,
that I've not said before.
It's important.
Thank you.
Now get some rest. We
have a big day tomorrow.
You see?
He has lost his mind.
Now as soon as
we're all in the van
I think to myself: Okay.
Now it starts.
The coup has begun.
My life is no longer
in my command.
Come on, make it snappy!
I'm in a red zone!
With the help of Barry, our inside man,
we unload Albert and Jean-Louis
at the North Tower.
The plan was to
hide them in Barry's
office until nightfall.
Red zone.
Au revoir.
- Red zone!
- A bientot.
Je t'aime.
I love you too.
Albert and Jean-Louis dress
like impeccable architects.
They carry attache cases that are heavy
because they carry equipment.
And a blueprint tube containing
the bow and arrow.
I feel the incline as we drive down into
the loading dock of the South Tower,
and I knew - I knew! -
We'd be caught there.
Stop right there, cowboy.
You guys keep
quiet back there.
That cop seemed very suspicious.
I almost crapped my pants.
Hey! No way!
No way!
We got a delivery to the 82nd floor,
the Fisher Fence Company.
No. Only booked
deliveries go up.
All the elevators
are leased today.
- Come back next week.
- Next week?
Yeah. Next week.
Come on, go home.
[Speaking French]
Take a pause.
Workers' pause.
Excuse me sir, before I get in
your hair, could I get your name?
- Frank Silvani.
- That Sicilian?
- Calabrese.
- Ah. Good.
I got two Sicilians
neighbours, two floors below.
Always cooking calamari.
Stinks up the place to high hell.
- Can you believe this asshole Nixon?
- If it were up to me,
he'd be in jail the
rest of his life.
You sound like my old man. Said this
country went to hell in a handbasket
- the day Kennedy got shot.
- That's for goddam sure.
- What did you say your name was?
- JP.
Named after JP Morgan.
So I sit there, helpless,
watching these workers.
And in my mind it seems like these
workers are moving like snails.
Good night, boys.
Great day. Have
a good one.
You wallflowers
still here?
Mr. Silviani, I'm gonna level you.
If we don't make this delivery,
we're gonna get fired.
Bill here's a dead
duck for sure.
- Whaddaya got? Where you goin'?
- 82nd floor.
Jimmy! Take these Frogs
up to the 82nd floor.
- You're kidding, right?
- Come on, it's your last ride!
- Okay?
- Okay, thank you sir!
Yeah, yeah. Come on
- Which floor?
- Ah, the 110th floor.
110? There's
nothing there.
- It's just a mechanical floor.
- Yes, but perfect for us.
We need to be close
to the roof.
The roof. Why the roof?
Because we have all the
pieces for the antenna,
and the mast, and the
electrified security fence,
and all the components
for the insulators.
- We need to measure-
- Yes, and we can't touch the wiring.
- The whole system's 4 months behind.
- This is a big problem.
Whatever. Watch your fingers.
[Speaking French]
We had a lucky break. This elevator
is taking us to the 110th floor.
But this means that JP has to get
the elevator operator back down.
If he stays with us,
the coup's finished.
110.
Jimmy, we really
appreciate this.
Hey. Let me buy you a beer.
These guys gotta offload,
they have tons of inventory
to do. It'll take forever.
They'll find their way home.
- Whatever. Watch your fingers.
- All right!
Mez. What's that, Greek?
I got a Greek guy, lives two floors
below. Always eating lamb.
Nothin' but lamb.
Oh. Man. This is
becoming a real bummer.
We unload here.
Okay.
We take the cable first. If anyone
stops us, we say it's for the antenna.
- This shit's heavy, man.
- Be quiet.
Really heavy!
Not bullshit heavy!
This is giving me a
really bad vibe, man.
Oh shit.
Oh man, the
pigs are here!
- Oh man, the jig is up!
- Shh!
Oh man. Oh man.
- It's freakin' me out, man!
- Just be quiet!
I can't do this, man.
I am wiggin' out, man!
Just listen.
We don't need you.
Go, okay? Just go.
No, not that way! That's the
stairwell! There's an elevator there.
Listen man,
I really want to help you guys do
something radical, but you know...
Oh, man. Oh, man.
Our only hope was maybe this guard
would move to another floor,
or maybe after dark we
could sneak past him, but ...
I must admit, by this
time I was very worried
that the coup
was over already.
Hey, Annie!
- I've been looking for you.
- Is everything okay?
We hit a little snag, but I
think everything's all right.
Okay.
Jesus Christ!
Can't believe they
don't gate this shaft!
Someone's gonna
get killed.
And there we sit, balancing on
a steel I-beam for eternity.
And the worst part, the
most painful part,
was our heavy construction
shoes, killing our feet.
I see the walkie-talkie, but
I don't see the guard.
So what does this mean?
Is the guard gone?
Is he still there, just
standing outside my view?
He wouldn't leave his walkie-
talkie unattended, would he?
I turn to Jeff,
and I see the terror on his face, and his
terror begins to seep into my mind.
And I start to conjure these
hideous thoughts myself.
Time passes. I keep
looking and looking,
and this walkie-talkie just sits
there, and I'm wondering,
what's going on with the security
guard and his walkie-talkie?
Is he playing with me? Is he waiting for
me to come out, so he can laugh at me?
Is he asleep?
Then, about an hour
after nightfall,
he's gone.
[Speaking French]
[Speaking French]
Look! They made it!
[Speaking French]
Jean-Louis and I had worked
out some hand signals.
Now he's telling me he's
ready to shoot the arrow.
He's supposed to signal. Then
5 seconds later, he shoots.
But after five seconds,
nothing happens.
I listen for the sound of the
arrow, but I hear nothing.
I look around. I see nothing.
Maybe the arrow's flown too far.
So I move my arms around,
hoping I'll feel the
invisible fishing line.
But I feel nothing.
- [Speaking French]
- I'm looking for the line!
I take off my clothes. With more surface
of bare skin, I'll be able to feel the line.
[Speaking French]
[Speaking French]
So I throw my clothes on, and
we run our gear up to the roof,
as fast as we can.
I think we should get some rest
and come back before sunrise.
- You go. I'm staying.
- All night?
There's nothing we can do here.
He'll either pull this off or he won't
And you look suspicious standing
here with binoculars around your neck.
I'll keep moving.
- New York's dangerous.
- I'll be fine.
I wonder if Philippe knows
you're still out here.
- Bring you a donut in the morning?
- Thank you.
- Hello, you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
OK, good. We have
communication.
I'll measure the rope, to see
where to put the cavalettis.
[Speaking French]
I'll guard it
with my life.
Davorski. You awake?
- Very funny.
- I need you to check something on 37.
What do you got?
A pepperoni, with
sausage and extra cheese.
Now you're talking.
[Speaking French]
We need an alarm signal.
Cavalettis in place. We're ready to
pass the wire. Are you ready?
- Yes.
- Ok. First the heavy rope.
We got the rope.
Okay, we're
sending the cable.
[Speaking French]
Okay. Okay.
- We have a problem.
- We'll do everything we can
to pull up the cable.
There's only a few
hours before daylight.
We will do
everything we can.
This is crazy. We'll never
finish at this rate.
- Yes, we will. We will finish.
No. We won't!
We're all gonna get
caught and go to jail.
And the rigging isn't safe.
I won't watch you fall.
I'm leaving, okay? I quit.
Albert, listen. Yes.
I agree with you, ok?
If the rigging isn't done by daylight,
and if the rigging's not safe,
then I'll give up.
Hey, look who made it
through the night.
- I got your donuts.
- Thank you.
Hey, the wire's up!
Yes, but not tight yet.
Something's wrong.
- Philippe, are you there?
- Yes, I'm here.
The good news is, the cable is
tied and secured at this end.
The bad news is,
Albert has quit.
He says the sun is rising
and the coup is off.
Did you put wood between the
anchor point and the cable?
Did you hear me?
Albert is on strike.
He will no longer lift a finger to
help me. Not only that,
he smuggled a camera up here. He's
going to take pictures and send them.
I knew it. I told you we
couldn't trust him.
[Speaking French]
You will always be my official photographer.
They're moving!
He's going for it!
Look. It's moving up.
[Speaking French]
I can't do that!
[Speaking French]
- Seven times seven!
- Forty nine!
Nine times eight!
Seventy-two!
[Speaking French]
Seven times eight!
Fifty-six!
96 divided by 8!
[Speaking French]
[Speaking French]
And that's the moment in my adventure
I called "mysterious visitor."
I have no idea who he is.
I've never seen him again.
And I can only imagine
what he must have thought.
Now it's time to put on my costume.
But I have to do it privately.
So my dressing room is the
very ledge of the building,
not visible from the
streets of Manhattan.
The dressing room is also something
that Papa Rudy taught me.
This is where the
transformation takes place.
This is where the disguise, the impostor,
the intruder, becomes the performer.
The artist.
Oh my god, he's falling!
No, no. It's just his shirt
It's just the shirt.
Hey. Nothing yet, huh?
Better get cracking.
I lost my costume!
This is the greatest day of my life
and I lose my costume!
- It fell off the edge. I have no costume!
- So?
[Speaking French]
What should we do?
We do it. We do it anyway.
I walk in this ridiculous
undershirt, but we do it.
I have one foot on the building,
one foot on the wire.
The outside world
starts to disappear
Jeff no longer existed.
My tower was deserted.
I no longer heard the
sounds of New York.
Everything fell silent.
All I could see was the wire, floating
out in a straight line to infinity.
And if I were to shift my weight,
I would become a wirewalker.
As soon as my entire
weight is on the cable,
I feel immediately a
feeling I know by heart.
I feel the wire
supporting me.
I feel the towers
supporting the wire.
Oh my god,
he's doing it.
He's doing it!
See? Oh my god!
He's doing it!
Everbody! Look!
Look at the
wirewalker! There!
I approach the first
cavaletti - and it's upside down.
But I look closer,
and it seems okay.
Thank you Papa Rudy, for
suggesting the three bolts
Watch what you're doing.
You're doing it, Philippe.
I arrived at the north tower feeling
the most intense joy.
The most profound satisfaction
I've ever felt in my life.
Philippe. Come on, Philippe.
Okay. Yeah.
Working now. Okay.
Something to tell our
grandchildren, huh?
Philippe, smile.
My friend. Thank you.
I had finished my crossing.
The coup was over.
But then I looked over
at the South Tower,
and it was still
calling to me.
So I'm thinking...
Maybe I should get
back on my wire.
He's coming back out.
And then, I feel
something that maybe...
I've never
truly felt before.
I feel thankful.
So I get down on one knee,
and I salute.
First I salute the wire,
and the towers.
And then I salute the
great city of New York.
Then, as I stand,
I see two uniforms!
The cops!
What the hell is that?
- Cuff him!
- Hey!
- Get your hands on your head!
- Down!
Get your hands on your
head! Get down!
- Holy shit, this one's a Frog!
- French. I'm French.
Look. Fella. Just...
come on in.
And, uh... we'll talk
about it, all right?
Okay, buddy. Come on.
Come on in.
Yeah. Show's over.
Okay, come on.
Parlez-vous Americano?
- Jesus.
- Fuck!
These officers, god bless
them. They remind me
of when I had to run
from the police. But...
They can't follow
me up here.
What the hell
do we do now?
By now I'm becoming aware of the
people on the ground, watching.
My audience.
And although this is something a
wirewalker should never do...
I look... down.
And it was...
peaceful.
Calm and serene.
Not dangerous.
Did you hear that?
Someone's coming.
Go, go, go!
Go go go! Go go go!
Hey pal, you wanna come
down off that thing, all right?
Why are you doing this?
Woah, woah. Come on!
Don't waste anyone's time!
Come on. Get down off that wire
now! Quit fooling around.
- Oh, shit. Hey, hey!
- Don't fall.
Don't go fallin'!
I don't believe
this little pissant!
Now with police
on both rooftops,
I had no choice. I had
to stay on my wire.
Woah, woah, woah. Buddy.
Unbelievable!
All right. You get him.
I got your back.
- You got me?
- I got you.
Okay.
Okay, come on.
- That's it. Nice and slow.
- Let's go.
That's it. Come
on, buddy. That's it.
Okay. Here we go.
Here we go.
Yup. Okay, man.
What are you doing? Damn!
What are you doing?
- You s.o.b.!
- Come on!
Unbelievable.
- Now I've seen everything.
- Damn straight.
This dude is righteous!
He'd better wrap it up.
There's a storm
front moving in.
There on my back,
the sky fills my vision.
The clouds.
They're like music.
Then something appears.
An apparition. A bird.
This bird is looking at me,
and I feel this silent threat.
Easy. Easy.
Suddenly I'm invaded by
doubts. I'm thinking maybe
the cable's tired
of supporting me.
What if my towers are talking to each
other? What if they've had enough?
What if they decide
to eject me?
I'm thinking maybe it's time
for me to end this trespass.
This is the New York
Port Authority Police!
Remove yourself from
the wire immediately!
You're in violation of about
100 city ordinances.
I want you off that wire immediately, or
we'll be forced to remove you from it!
[Speaking French]
But I can't end my
walk if I have doubts.
With curved shoulders
and hanging head.
I decide.
I will only leave my
wire and towers...
in victory.
Officers of the New
York Police Department,
thank you for
your patience.
I announce my arrival
to the police.
I tell him my
work is finished.
But my work
is not finished.
I still have three
more steps to do.
Philippe!
Are you okay?
You got it. You got it.
My name is Philippe
Petit. I'm a wirewalker.
- Smartass.
- Show's over.
No. No. Don't cut the wire.
Don't cut my wire!
Nobody gives a damn
about your wire!
It'll snap! It'll
hurt someone!
Wait guys.
He's right.
- Where's the handle?
- Hidden in a hole in the wall.
Watch your fingers.
I gotta to tell you. What
you did was something.
I'll never see anything like
that again my life.
You got guts, pal.
Good job.
The world wants to know.
Why you're doing this?
Why are you attempting
something so dangerous?
There is no why. Just because...
when I see a good place to
put my wire, I cannot resist.
Later in the day, a judge sentenced
Petit to walk the wire again,
but this time in Central Park
for a crowd of children,
and only a few feet
off the ground.
The story of the coup was in
the news all over the world!
In France, when Papa
Rudy heard about it,
he was the happiest
Papa Rudy there is.
When Papa Rudy's angry,
he's terribly angry,
but when Papa Rudy's happy, his
dogs get a double ration of food.
The most fantastic
moment for me
was when I saw you answer
my shooting signal.
At that moment I knew the
coup would be a success.
Why? We almost lost the arrow.
It was on the edge of the building.
No, it was exactly
where I was aiming.
So you admit it? You wanted to
see him in his birthday suit.
Okay, okay.
I would like to make a toast.
To all of you.
My accomplices.
I know I can be, er...
a bit difficult,
but, but...
You never
gave up on me.
And because of this I was able
to walk on that wire.
So for allowing
me this honour...
Thank you.
Cheers!
Look at that!
We did it. We showed the world
that anything's possible.
They're different.
Hey Philippe, they're
different now.
Yeah, that's right. They're different
because you walked up there.
Every New Yorker I talk to now
says they love these towers.
Perhaps you
brought them to life,
giving them a soul.
Jean-Louis and Jeff soon after
returned to France.
But I stayed.
I was proud to become
a New Yorker.
Now in order to stay, I had to
pay my debt to society,
so the judge mandated that I
perform a free walk in Central Park.
Of course, I was
happy to do this.
Annie...
Sadly Annie returned
to France.
Tu es sur?
Oui. Je suis sur.
You came to your place.
Now it's time to find mine.
A bientot.
Au revoir.
Annie.
Thank you.
For everything.
I'm glad the towers
called you.
That was incredible.
Just don't do that again.
You remember Guy Tozzoli,
from the press conference,
one of the men behind
the creation of the towers.
He loved the walk, and gave me
a pass to the observation deck,
so I could go any
time I wanted.
And I went there
many times, alone.
I'd find myself there,
looking at the void,
to see how the
thoughts come back,
and the feeling returns.
Because it was...
it was a beautiful day.
And you know, this
pass I was given...
these passes have
a date on them,
a date when they expire. But on my
pass, Mr Tozzoli crossed out the date,
and he wrote on it:
Forever.
