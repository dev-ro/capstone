Here I am.
- Esra!
Finally girl, where have you been?
Your stress took away all my energy.
Don't ask, how she drowned me
in last-minute tasks.
- Zeynep, you've become so beautiful...
- Thanks dear, it's not overdone, right?
- No of course not, wonderful.
- Stop the chat dear.
- Start getting dressed soon!
- Don't worry, I'll be ready in two minutes.
- Didem, please give me my shoes!
- OK, I'm finishing.
Here it is.
Would you like to see my work?
Let me see.
Isn't it a little bit long?
That's OK guys, thanks.
- I still can't believe you're getting
married. - Me, neither!
This means you will leave now and
not return back home with us, right?
Hey, don't be ridiculous,
nothing will change.
- It won't, right?
- Yes.
Not a single handsome guy
in the whole crowd, you see?
A girl like me is alone!
It must be a joke!
Our best friend is getting married,
where is your man?
He was busy I guess,
but might be coming soon.
One might think he is a businessman!
Isn't he busy only with managing
the rental income of the real estate...
...inherited from his father
and then just loafing around?
- Furthermore, he is tight-fisted!
- Don't talk like this, she gets sad.
Hey, finally he's here!
- Want to hear my guess?
- Absolutely not.
"I had to wait for my brother
who had taken my car."
How are you girls?
- Where have you been, Oguz?
I had to wait for my brother
who had taken my car.
You could have called.
My cell-phone's run out of power,
and no tokens were available.
OK, Don't be wordy. Anyhow
you could manage to come here.
Why do they serve food to
so many people?
Money should be spent on real estate
instead of a wedding ceremony, right?
Why are you looking at me like that,
am I wrong?
Give me the wine.
Why did you dress up in this color?
It's not good for you.
It makes you look
at least 5 years older!
- Really?
- I say it, really.
Come on, cheers!
Oh my. I am driving crazy.
Remember Necla the bitch and
Derya the snotty from the literature class?
They are over there.
Do you see how they've turned
out to "ladies"?
Look at their husbands.
One of them looks like owning ships
and the other one's like an architect.
Shame on us.
Come on, let's dance.
Hi. Would you please dance with me?
Oguz, could you please ask
me to dance?
What dance? You know I don't like
the slow dance. Come on, stop this.
You've seen Esra's boyfriend, right?
Zero charisma!
Never mind his look! Watching him
for 2 minutes was enough!
She the idiot,
couldn't find a real man to lean on!
I'm sure she lives a dog's life!
She was a bright girl, with documented
appreciations in the school.
- She should have been smarter.
- Come on, let's go.
You idiot!
You think this word is written like that?
I just want to know,
can't you read what you've written?
No head on your shoulders?
Even a trainee can write "trainee"!
I couldn't understand you.
Even the 20-days-trainees...
...can get on what you can't!
- Just like your husband gets them on!
- What?
I say, your husband as well,
is getting them on!
Hi Oguz, where are you?
OK, I'm coming.
How are you?
Hey men, bring me
an extra-sized portion!
- Eat something!
- No, I won't.
Why do we always eat here?
Why not going
around Bosphorus for fish?
If you pay for it, why not?
But if it's me to pay, I never
sacrifice 200 TL just for a meal!
You used to laugh when I do this.
Now you get angry.
As you say, I used to.
Why do you look so down,
what happened?
I resigned.
What? You resigned?
Are you aware of the unemployment
problem and the economical crisis?
Could you please tell me
why you resigned?
It was not the job of my ideals,
you know.
Since when have you got ideals,
my darling?
Which job is your goal?
For example, I can be a copywriter
in an advertising agency.
Look at you! Copywriting
in an advertising agency!
Come on! Do you think the top agencies
are expecting you to join them? Page
What do you know about advertising?
You couldn't even get a promotion
for the last 5 years! 5 years!
Clean yourself now and
see how fun it is!
By the way, you're boring, tight-fisted
and look like a gay when dancing!
So you broke up with the guy
and quitted yourjob, right?
Then, come on girls,
cheers for starting-over!
For starting-over!
Hey girls, look at those handsome guys.
I'm thrilled!
Bar boy!
Haven't they fired you yet?
Hey, look at Erdis!
Erdis. Erdis.
He will never settle down!
As you see, it lasts only 10 seconds
even to feel any intention for such men!
Come on, stop acting like this,
like Oguz's desperate housewife!
Come on, give me the glance of...
..."I am the most
beautiful woman in the world".
I can demonstrate
if you don't know how to do!
Exactly like this! Bravo!
Erdis! Come on my dear,
let me introduce you to my cousins!
OK, I'm coming dear.
- Come soon!
- OK, I will.
Half of Istanbul is the cousin
of this bitch!
Another Martini please!
Cheers!
I told you not to drink the last one!
You made me drink!
I am exhausted!
Hey, I forgot my cell-phone inside,
let me take it.
- Esra.
- Yes?
Be ready.
Wait for me, I'm coming soon.
- Wait, don't leave.
- OK.
Didem!
Which one is my Beetle?
Didem.
Isn't that your car?
My car.
Here I am.
Esra!
Where did she get lost in 2 minutes?
Miss... Are you OK?
- Feeling cold.
- OK, we'll solve that problem.
What's going on over there?
She's my friend!
Hey, leave me alone.
Sorry but you can't sleep in my car.
- What the hell you're doing? Esra!
- Cem, look at...
- One moment, miss...
- Go aside, let me...
- Could you please calm down miss.
- What are you doing to her?
She's my friend. Who are you?
What are you doing with her?
- You carry her, then.
- Will do that.
Did they hurt you?
Are you OK? Hey, help!
Esra.
Are you OK?
Sorry, so many apologies.
When I saw her drunk I misunderstood!
Can I do something for you?
Bring some ice?
You would better not do anything for me!
- Which one is your car?
- That one.
- Where did they pop up from?
- From the club...
Esra.
- Come on, wake up!
- What?
- I feel down.
- What happened?
I missed Zeynep.
If it's like this even at start,
how will we be able to go on?
Would I call her?
No you wouldn't. It's inappropriate.
I will call.
She wouldn't mind.
Zeynep, we missed you very much.
- What are you doing?
- We're in the bed, just woke up.
Still in the bed?
What are you doing in the bed?
I'm working, what else to expect?
- My dear, here's your breakfast.
- Ergun prepared the breakfast. Kisses.
That's cool.
By the way,
I also missed you too much.
Hey come on, I'm a married woman
now, don't disturb me!
OK don't worry. Kisses.
I will call later. Bye!
She's also missed us, see?
- Come on, wake up!
- Didem.
Move then.
Let me lay down, too.
Wake up.
What is this?
A jumper.
I still cannot believe such things
happened last night.
Me neither. Still on my mind.
I think they stand at the top level
in men's league.
After an experience like Oguz
first I have to figure out what a man means.
So many vacant positions.
Which one should I apply?
Can we see them again?
This is a metropolitan city.
Are we living in a village?
- Esra?
- What?
This is him, right?
And this is you, right?
Famous actor Cem Sezgin and the
mysterious woman who left the bar...
...separately despite having fun
together, was not missed.
Mysterious woman.
...and the mysterious woman
was not missed.
Didem, it's enough,
for the last 2 months this is...
...the 5 millionth time that you read
the same news, I'm fed up!
What can I do? They've stated us as
lovers; don't you think this is a sign?
Yes it's a sign,
but a sign of your sickness!
Girl, he's an actor,
he's owned by the public...
...I mean he's a dream,
you have to forget about him!
Hey, you take away my energy,
please don't be so negative!
You may not be aware but there
are more important things in life.
I couldn't afford the house rental
of the last month.
Wipes of my car still
don't function properly.
I've applied for 16 positions
but none of them's reacted yet.
I'm dying of unemployment,
do you understand?
OK, you're right.
Listen.
This house belongs to my father.
So it can be considered
as yours, too.
Don't mind the rental.
And you'll find a very good job shortly.
I will always stand by you.
Hello.
Yes it's me.
For the interview?
OK, at 11 o'clock.
I'll be there. Thanks.
See? This is a sign, too.
Now you will go and get thatjob!
Hey, I am very much excited!
- Mysterious woman...
- Come on, it's more than enough.
Hello. I've come for interview.
You, too?
Up in the 4th floor.
The second room at left in the corridor.
Please wait there together
with the other candidates.
This side or that side?
This side you can use only
when you're employed.
Use the left side please.
You prepared a campaign to exert
a bomb-effect in the market, right?
No doubt.
Good. I'm already excited.
- Why don't we start?
- Let's start.
We need more subscribers.
What did we say? What is the
final situation at the invoice?
...what they ask from us.
What will we offer?
One: Subscriber.
More minutes.
More... Love.
Yes. You've prepared a lot of things.
All of them look like to be related
to our products, but...
...I'm afraid you couldn't perceive...
...neither our brief nor the target group.
First of all, the mottos should
be easy to recall...
...and belonging to the public.
Everybody here for the interview?
So, work is our work.
- Excuse me, what did you say?
- Me?
Yes, exactly. You said
something a moment ago.
I said, work is our work.
Here it is. Work is our work.
This is a very good starting point
for our corporate identity.
We can soon prepare a wonderful
campaign based on this motto.
You have 1 week. If it doesn't work,
we'll look for other alternatives.
There is no need for other
alternatives, Muammer.
In a few days we'll prepare and
present you the new campaign.
OK then, you'll let us know.
Hello mum,
I'm accepted for the post.
Copywriting in an
advertising agency.
I say I'm employed but you're talking
about getting married.
OK, kiss you. Bye. Kisses.
Say hello to dad, too. Bye.
Here it is, cosmic forces coupled
you again.
Imagine the picture, you're with him
and me with Cem Sezgin.
Don't involve me, I am completely
focused on my career.
Well, my career plan at this moment is...
...to get into relation with Cem Sezgin.
- But you don't know him yet.
- Who is he, what type of a man he is.
- You think so? Have a look at this.
- What is this?
- Listen. All the information, interviews...
...I gathered and read about him.
He's a top-quality guy.
Didem, you're sick.
Let me read you what he's said
in his latest interview.
Listen carefully.
A woman should be clever enough
not to exist under the shadow of a man...
...but should be emotional enough
to get rest under that shadow.
Really good.
Of course, I spent 2 hours to be able to
comprehend what he means.
He's intelligent, bright, charismatic.
He's got everything looked for.
I can fall in love with him.
He's too perfect.
I mean, could he be a gay?
Could he be?
No, I don't think so.
Don't speak so negatively,
you take away my energy!
I'm scared of Yigit's
hyper-interest in women.
If he can't find a proper woman
he'll shift to the 3rd dimension.
I think, in any case
we should be careful.
Don't laugh.
Gentlemen,
have you seen the ladies?
We will be together this evening.
The group is cool. Join?
Two heads are better than one!
All you want to do is
to hump anybody, right?
My God.
It's more fun than to workout.
First of all, you spend more calories.
Is it clear?
All the girls are dying for me.
What kind of a man am I?
The question is, what is it that
the girls find in him.
- Would I show you?
- Come on.
I will show you, I will.
Cem Sezgin, maybe you would like to drink.
What are you doing man?
Are you sick?
We might have called her.
Will we call of them, man? This has
no end. No one has seen the bottom.
I've seen the bottom, it's quite
beautiful. Let me tell you something.
I think you should get married because
you've done over, finished.
What marriage? I can't find a girl
even to go around together.
Everybody is running after Cem Sezgin.
Nobody cares about Cem.
What a pity.
I'm touched to the heart!
Look. This is the list of
my boyfriends so far.
Physical look, intelligence, profession,
performance, character, family, manner.
And those are my topics.
One moment, I couldn't catch.
You mean all of those are your...
Includes the men I had dinner out, too.
A quite innocent list, wait.
Focus on the conclusion.
When we add the positive points...
...of all those men,
it comes up as one person:
Cem Sezgin! I have to reach the goal
using the right strategy.
Right strategy - goal.
Right strategy - goal.
You see, I'm a bright woman.
This is the girl.
I've been working for months to
approach her but not yet achieved.
This must be the first time
in the whole history.
Exactly, man. I can get married
to this girl, you know?
Sitting in front of me with her miniskirt,
putting ice in my whiskey, licking my ears.
Yes man, why not?
She can do all those things.
I like this way.
But she doesn't encourage me.
Do you think I've fallen in love?
- What will I do, buddy?
- Let me tell you.
- She is not interested in you.
- You think so?
- Hey man, you can help me.
- I'm not competent in those things.
You're incompetent?
You can make people buy even waffles.
It's such a disgusting job.
Listen now. Consider me as a product.
Am I clear?
Link me to my consumer.
Make them consume me, man.
Considering that your product
has been selling...
...enormously for the last
300.000 years...
...I think I can really do something
for you.
What are you doing, man?
- What the hell he's doing?
- Come on, keep calm.
Please don't do such kind of things.
Why is he doing that?
Why, man?
What are you doing?
Why did you such a thing?
You've ruined everything.
I've been trying to approach her for months.
How did you...
How did you do it?
Give me that...
It's normal that you cannot approach
this girl. Take it.
You cannot fool me.
SECRETS TO IMPRESS MEN
Listen to what's written here.
Read, I'm listening.
Nobody, especially men, is aware of the
value of what they've achieved easily.
Quite right.
Be mysterious.
Let him discover you.
Look at me! I tell everything within
the first 10 minutes.
The common belief that men don't
favor clever women is totally wrong.
You must definitely have a good job
or a well-developed talent.
No job! But I must have a talent!
How unlucky I am.
It's obvious that he's snob.
You can only look at them!
No dare to touch!
Falling in love? So stupid.
Could he be single?
Good morning.
- Storyboards ready?
- Yes.
I'm expecting everybody in the
meeting room in 15 minutes.
- My London tickets ready?
- Yes, for the 19.30 flight this evening.
- Good.
- Who accompanies you? I'm not informed.
I travel with the girls in the company.
Haven't I told you?
- No.
- Let's move for the meeting.
OK.
We will be diverging to Russia
via this campaign.
You should prepare such an
effective campaign that...
...which is the reason
we work with you, by the way...
...that it will enable us
to hit the women from the heart.
OK.
Suzan, which class are we supposed
to communicate to? A, B, or C?
- Which class are you from?
- Naturally, A class.
You, young lady, which class
are you from?
It can only be Class F. Or L.
Then we will target F Class. Or L.
Could people be classified, Ece?
Particularly the women?
The Woman is important,
beautiful, and special.
Even a Cinderella; she's a princess.
What class you're talking about?
I totally agree with you.
Just tell us the feeling you would
like to evoke in the consumers.
Love at first sight.
Passion, courage and...
...excitement.
If we consider that love is composed
of those 3 elements...
Maturity, eternity and devotion.
Aren't they also the ingredients of love?
How good you've put love into words...
One of you in men's style,
the other one in women's...
If we consider that love is composed of
those ingredients...
...then comes...
...no requirement
for questioning and reasoning...
...no getting concerned and cheapness.
This is one of the most important
policies of our company.
We've never been cheaper than
our competitors.
- Neither in quantity, nor in quality.
- Neither we've been.
In summary, let's be fantastic.
Let's do things that our competitors
cannot even dream of.
Why not?
What's this to which
you stick like a new bride.
Hold it from its tip, like this.
Wherever I hold it from,
it doesn't work.
Don't worry, it works. You only
need to avoid unnecessary shading.
- Right?
- Yes.
He so sweet, replying me
with "yes" to whatever I say.
- Hello dear.
- Didem.
It's impossible not to be impressed.
He's so nice that I want to cry.
I want to cry too,
as I'm so untalented!
Don't worry, never give up, OK?
Erdie did 5 pieces,
I couldn't even do 1 piece.
Hey, your man is here!
What? Cem Sezgin over there?
This is the moment that
my style's become rubbish!
Enough!
You've been nagging whole day.
- Really?
- Yes!
OK then. Let's make a public survey.
Let's do.
Excuse me, hello.
I'm interrupting you...
...but I need your comments
about a very important topic.
Now listen carefully.
Would you be mine
if I wear this shoe or that one?
- Shame on you!
- What?
- Come on.
- Why?
I would be yours in any case.
You are the only living creature
that I am afraid of!
What's the problem? Young people
communicate in this style nowadays.
- I've got your picture.
- Where are you going, baby?
You as well, give me please.
Where are you going?
To impress a man.
But don't forget to avoid excess shading!
What a jerk I am.
You do it very well.
Hello buddy.
- What's that?
- For Selen.
You know I give the impression
of a bastard...
...so we tried to sort it out.
- Yeah, you look somewhat better.
I think he will be completely in
good trim if gets rid of the beard.
Guys, I can get rid of the
little one totally...
...so that all of us will feel more
comfortable. Hey, isn't it enough?
OK man, don't get nervous.
Hey buddy, the girl outside...
Exactly.
- Which girl? What's going on?
- Nothing.
Oh yes, you're talking about
that chick.
But she's not in-line
with my criteria.
- Now I have my Selen!
- What's Selen, man?
I mean, what does she mean for you?
Let me tell you. The issue is...
...when I sleep with a girl,
after the course is over...
...I tend to kick her out, I feel
irritated and looking for her leave.
But this girl's about to break
a record as being...
...the only woman I'm
thinking of for the last 24 hours.
May I have fallen in love?
Up to me, your brain's getting eroded...
Guys, we'll print this catalogue
in 10 days but still the photos are missing.
Don't look at me,
he is the responsible one.
You're too busy, let me call
Tamer, he'll manage it in 2 days.
Hey, don't worry,
you'll get it in 2 days.
- Did you fly here?
- Almost. He's still here, right?
- Yes.
- Would I have changed my dress?
Mert and Yigit are in the agency.
I have to leave.
We'll talk.
- Beautiful paintings.
- Thanks.
Hello.
Hello.
Do I know you?
In fact, no.
Your friend had fallen into my friend's car.
And you jumped over me
due to misunderstanding.
Oh yes, sorry,
as my mind's so busy...
Let me go now.
In fact...
...I've always wanted
to spend time on painting.
Do you give courses?
Sorry, I have no time.
Nothing to do then.
By the way, I'm Cem Sezgin.
Didem Donmez.
But now I really have to go.
I mean,
I have so many things to do.
- Don't be late for the theatre tonight.
- Which one?
Well, it's on the tip of my ton...
"Words on the tip of my tongue".
You'll go watching that one?
Yes but how do you know?
- My colleagues from the TV series...
- TV series?
I'm an actor, in "Farewell" now.
Oh sorry, I cannot watch TV series,
don't have much time for that.
Usually I read. See you.
- See you.
- Have a good day.
I was proud of you today.
This is the power of the book.
How good was I?
Super-acting!
I was also about to believe.
He's supposed to be the actor!
- Surprise!
- Zeynep?
Drinking again?
What is that you like in it so much...
What did you to this house?
It's become like a barn!
How obvious that
I don't live here anymore.
- This time we're drinking to celebrate.
- Celebrating what?
Here stands the copywriter of the
best advertising agency of Turkey!
- Really?
- Yes...
Congratulations,
I'm very much pleased.
So the reason of drinking
is not sorrow this time.
- No, we're quite happy...
- Tell me, how it happened.
You know the man
in whose car I fell in.
I was invited for an interview by the
agency he works in, as a coincidence.
She's taken the wrong way,
left instead of right.
Yeah, I found myself in the meeting room.
Then I am accepted!
There is no such an example
of getting a job!
- Our cars please.
- Right now, Mr. Cem.
Mr. Cem's car please.
Cem Sezgin, we are sick for you!
What type of a feeling it is that
your name is screamed by the girls?
Ordinary. But today, for the first time
I had to give my name to a girl.
In the office. She was pretty.
Which girl?
What are you talking about?
Friend of that girl just started
in your office.
She had smacked on my head.
Today we met in your office.
Did she smack on your head?
Please introduce me to this girl soon.
The hands which smacked on
Cem Sezgin's head! Fabulous!
The same hands also paint pictures.
Cem? What's going on, man?
Nothing. It's only...
- I mean, she was beautiful!
- You the jerk!
Thanks.
Drive carefully!
Don't forget me.
I would be surprised
if you were not impressed.
I'm sure they're jerks!
Because you have such a
special talent that...
...If they ask you to select 1 out of
1000 men...
...you can soon identify the most
problematic one. Laughing?
This time it will be different.
We follow a plan,
trying to act smart.
I insist on saying to keep out.
Those men are different, girls.
You find yourself in bed in 2
and then out of the door in 5 minutes.
I have nothing to do with those types.
We will see.
Don't come to me and cry, then.
I'm focused on my job now.
My dear. For your new job, then!
For my new job!
Cem. Girls.
Are you ready?
Yes.
This is getting out of battery.
Install a new one!
I'm coming.
Change it. Very good, beautiful.
Cem, a little bit more please, look above!
You're arrogant.
Women are sick for you but you don't mind.
Exactly like this. OK.
Here's my man!
Cem, I don't want to make you bored.
Some more.
Yes! Here it is! Very good.
It's very difficult to be
in the same place...
...whole day looking at him.
How will I continue like this?
You should see, I'm chasing
a very big butterfly now.
There are smaller ones but
I cannot deal with them yet.
What difference it makes, big or small?
If you act so selective,
in the end you'll have nothing in hand.
Hey, one moment,
itjust landed on a treetop, stop.
Now you have to be very quiet
not to frighten it. OK?
Wish you could see, it's so nice.
- Is it beautiful?
Yes but I'm exhausted!
But you get tired very soon.
I'm running after a
single butterfly for 3 hours.
3 hours? What a butterfly it is.
OK then, take a lot of pictures of it.
See you.
Hi Yigit.
We finished the shooting.
Fabulous!
Oh, I love women.
No buddy, I wasn't talking to you.
If you're in the office,
we're coming right now.
Maybe I can be late for about
half on hour.
No, don't come. I have to go to the
sponsorship night of my top client.
Good news, man. Thanks.
Hello, how are you?
- I'm fine, thanks.
Mert, I was looking for you... My kid's got
fever. Yet, the babysitter won't be coming.
So I will not be able to join
the dinner tonight.
Hope he gets well soon.
- Thanks, see you.
Ece is also not here.
I cannot attend this dinner alone.
What are you doing?
Are you going to wear this one?
- I'm not sure. Is it OK or not?
- Don't be ridiculous. No way with this one!
Come on, let's change it.
Come on...
Hello.
How are you doing sweetie,
where are you?
I'm in the hotel dear, trying to relax.
Are you OK?
You sound a little bit strange.
I'm just back from shopping,
exhausted.
- I'm going out for Suzan's dinner.
- Could we talk later?
- OK, later.
- OK, bye.
Bye.
I hope I don't act ridiculous
during the dinner.
Don't worry!
Everything will be perfect!
Where are you going,
dressed like this?
To the Karaoke night of Erdi.
He sent a message to everybody.
- Cem Sezgin might also come!
- You are kidding!
Very important things, listen now:
Don't drink much! Don't forget to look in an
enchanting way! And don't talk too much!
He's here!
Hello. I was just about to get out.
OK, see you.
I'm leaving.
Stop! Don't go out immediately. He mustn't
think that you were waiting at the door.
Don't forget. The right strategy.
It is very important.
We will wait.
It's enough.
I can't wait any longer.
- I want to pee when I wait.
- No pee! We are waiting.
- You can go out now.
- Really?
Good luck!
- Good luck to you, too!
- OK, see you.
Hello.
- You're very beautiful.
- Thank you.
- We're late, let's move?
- OK.
My God, we are a perfect match.
Just like a bride and groom.
- Would you please come in?
- Sorry, I was lost for a minute.
- Hi, Suzan.
- Hi Mert.
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?
- I am fine.
- You look very good.
Thank you.
Remember Esra, from the agency?
Yeah, Class F. Hello.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Thanks. And you?
- I'm fine, thanks.
Look, I reserved
the best table for you.
You please sit down there,
I'm coming shortly.
Hello, welcome.
- What shall we drink?
- I would better not drink.
Don't worry,
I take the control tonight.
- White or red wine?
- White.
- White.
- OK.
I will not let you steal
my car tonight!
Oh yes, I've drunk a little bit
much that night.
Normally I don't.
We were celebrating something.
- Really? What was that?
- Don't ask.
Consider me as already asked
and yourself as already answered.
I had decided to change my life.
That's it.
Then let's toast for your decision
to change your life.
- How did it happen?
- What?
The scar at your hand.
This one?
I was about 8 or 9.
A cat in the schoolyard climbed up a tree.
And I followed her up.
- But then directly down!
- You fell down?
Yeah, directly crashed!
In an attempt to exhibit myself.
Hey, how nice to see you
again Esra.
Let me introduce.
My fianc, e, Ezgi.
Hi. How are you Mert?
- Fine. And you?
- Thanks, I'm fine.
She is the face of the brand.
Darling,
She is...
Sorry, you were unemployed recently. Now?
I started as a copywriter
in an advertising agency.
Copywriting?
I really wonder which naive
person hired you.
It's me.
Esra is such a special talent that
I would be only stupid to miss her.
OK.
Darling, let's dance.
- Afterwards, I will come up with a surprise.
- What's that?
- Your ex-boyfriend?
- Yes.
I may not be good in dancing
but I'm good in making a sad girl happy.
Would you dance?
OK.
I like this song very much.
It's so beautiful, right?
Yes, it is.
Sorry.
- I'm very bad, right?
- Unfortunately, yes.
They didn't show up yet.
I'm fed up. Really fed up. You've been
telling the same thing for the 30th time.
Night is still young.
I know those high-living bastards.
This place can only be in the
4th order in their bar-crawling list.
Don't wear a long face, take
your drink, come on. Toast!
Come on, this way.
Thanks.
Isn't she Selen?
God damned.
What the hell is this?
What is this? What the hack?
She was with me only last night.
Women, buddy.
You can't predict what they're gonna do.
I am extremely angry now!
Extremely nervous.
I'm a Turkish man.
I cannot digest something like that!
- He looks like an intellectual man.
- Of course not. He looks like my ass.
Don't look at him like that.
I don't want to have a
problem here now.
What can he do?
What problem can come out?
- Please calm down.
- One moment. One moment.
I won't cause a problem.
Just wanna talk.
Sorry to disturb you, but...
...I think I know you somehow.
Have we met before?
Yeah, you might know me from
the biennale, from the exhibition.
I have a very special face.
- Yeah, exactly.
- People think I look like somebody.
- And for you, whom do I look like?
- Like my ass!
- What?
- Go damned.
Bodyguards!
One moment. One moment.
How can you kick me out?
Do you know who I am?
Don't ever let them get in here!
Why are you yelling at me? We would
only ask for a signature from him.
- Right?
- Yeah.
Thanks god, press is not here.
You see how he was scared?
I am disposed!
How can she do this to me?
Those god damned
nymphomaniac women!
God will punish you.
Could you please calm down?
Is this mess not enough?
I feel extremely broken.
Do you think
I am in love with this girl?
I don't think at all.
In fact, I am bad enough, too.
Yeah, that's much better now.
And I feel extremely dynamic now.
Let's go to another nightclub.
- OK, come on.
- Hey, god damn you all!
- She's not opening the door.
- Have you lost your keys?
I guess I forgot at home.
You have a lovely voice, too.
Anything you are not good at?
- I guess nothing.
- This is for you, would you like to drink?
Thanks. I was about to take
a drink for myself.
Give me my purse.
- Would you drink?
- What the hell you're doing?
I will apply my strategy. Let's see
whether or not he will follow me.
- Never mind if he doesn't.
- Listen.
Here is very noisy. Would we move
for a more silent one?
I have to leave.
What do you think about those girls?
German and British.
This is the very moment to enter
the European Union.
Because I don't think
there's another way to enter.
Let's demonstrate the power of Turks.
Let's not miss this chance.
Let's enter the European Union
and not exit. Enter but not exit. Agree?
What the hell you're talking about?
This is completely instinctive.
I cannot avoid.
- Good night, Ms. Didem.
- Good night.
- I have to leave.
- Come on buddy, stay with me.
I will be coming back in 5 minutes.
- Promise?
- Promise.
Damn.
- Is it you taking those pictures?
- Yeah, each taken during different trips.
I'll go wear something homely.
Please help yourself.
OK.
- No service for cell-phone, I guess.
- Sometimes.
Where is the bathroom?
- Up in the stairs, right across you.
- Thanks.
No nail polish.
Neither polish-remover.
No extra toothbrush.
Not a single piece of hair
in the bathtub.
Most possibly, no girl friend!
- What would you like to drink?
- Might be white wine.
White wine.
- Shall we go out to the garden?
- OK.
I toast for your not being able to
get in home.
- Your garden is beautiful.
- Well, not bad.
- What makes you most happy in the life?
- Me?
Success.
Success makes most people happy.
I'm asking for something more special.
If you're willing to answer.
I don't know, I have never given
a thought on this.
For example, I get very happy
when I write something.
I guess I've had no dreams
for myself since childhood.
My job is to make other
people's dreams come true.
This is all what I've been doing
since I started this job.
And those dreams come true very soon.
How interesting questions you ask.
So this is why you don't know
what makes you happy, right?
Yeah, I cannot identify.
All right.
Sorry.
Hello.
I was sleeping
because I got very tired.
OK. Should we talk in a few minutes?
Damn!
I'm really very sorry.
- No problem. Are you OK?
- Yes I am.
- How did it happen?
- I don't know.
- You're so skillful!
- Very very sorry.
- Are you OK? No burns or something?
- No.
I'm OK.
Excuse me, my cell-phone's ringing.
Sorry.
Hi Esra, where are you?
You cannot believe where I am...
In Mert's place.
What? In his place?
We were just about to kiss each other.
Kiss each other?
Hey, don't go further!
Orjust let it go.
I've become nothing but miserable only
by acting so cautious. Let it go!
Kisses, bye.
See you, bye.
Didem's at home now. Would I go?
One minute.
Isn't it little bit early?
Yes, but only a little bit...
- But we don't know each other yet.
- You'll see, we'll do soon.
Sorry. Are you upset?
No.
I just...
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize.
- Could I ask for something?
- Please.
Could you sleep with me?
Just sleep?
I could.
Client's missed!
Good morning.
Good morning.
- See you in the office.
- See you.
Very romantic.
One minute, give me the details.
- How was the performance?
- Just perfect!
Yeah, I can see it. Your perceptions
are un-blocked, you light up!
Zeynep, please stop getting
in home like a thief!
Would you like to tell me as well
how your perceptions are un-blocked?
Do you know with whom
she was out together?
You shut up. Let her tell.
She couldn't come to the dinner,
so I had to accompany him...
...then we went to the dinner and...
- She slept with him!
Boo!
You follow her way, I see.
Congratulations.
- You did it, I know.
- I think she did.
Good morning.
Hi, dear.
He didn't call yet.
He will.
Esra, don't expect him to call you every
second like teenager lovers. Just relax.
Zeynep and I are on our way to Erdi's
cafe. Why don't you join us after work?
- She should!
- Come on; we will be waiting for you.
He hasn't called yet, right?
Not yet but he will.
You bet.
Forget this man. He's already
got all what he's desired.
Don't talk nonsense. It will work.
He held her hand. This is love.
- It'll work.
- You think so?
OK, stop talking about me.
How is yourself, tell me.
- I feel extremely down.
- Why, what happened?
Last night Ergun talked about
being a family, kids etc.
What was your reaction?
Of course, I told him that
I'm not planning to have a kid now.
I said it's a very big responsibility.
Why would we make life
more tough which is already so, I said.
What about trying to understand him.
Can you imagine me with kids?
Cold-hearted.
Don't start again. I do not want!
- Move!
- You have to pass it.
What's going on Mert...
...did you miss a client today?
Me? Could I ever miss
Gentlemen, what I see
for the last 2 sessions is...
...your bodies are here but mentally
you're with women somewhere else.
Who are those women, I want to know.
Slow down. OK,
I'm confused but not that much.
Could the girl in the office be
the reason of this confusion?
Possibly.
- Might you have fallen in love?
- No.
Why are you getting so confused?
I don't understand.
You can manage both of them.
I've experienced it a lot of times,
it works, they don't get it.
But you can get it on.
I'm too bad, right?
One moment. We're not
talking about the same thing.
Women have something
called 6th sense.
They've had their hormones
while we've had our cardiologists.
You're right.
Come on, focus on the game.
OK, I'm getting out.
- Guys, I'm leaving.
- Look at this!
If you break thatjoystick too...
...I will ask you to buy me a new system.
- Move, man.
Goal!
This guy's called Ronaldo!
This time Mert's really screwed up!
I don't think so, this is just an adventure.
3 days later he'll lose his desire and...
...be directly back to the same club.
- Not this time.
- Also this time, he will.
- Wanna bet?
- Challenging me?
But, I know Mert very well.
OK. What's the prize?
A bet, you say?
The prize is...
Seats for the Opening Match
of the World Cup.
Deal.
I think I made a mistake by finding
the worst man in the world.
Bravo! I told you so.
Girls, I fell in love with this man.
Idiot!
I don't see a good future for any of us.
Me, for example...
A woman of 65 years old with 20 cats
and still considering herself as happy.
I know it.
What to drink?
Welcome.
- White wine please.
- Of course sir.
You haven't talked at all
since we met tonight.
How well do we know each other,
you think?
I know every single point
of you quite well.
- Really?
- Yeah.
OK then, how did it happen?
- What?
- This.
- What's that?
- This.
I don't know.
If you haven't known it for 5 years,
there is a problem. Right?
You're strange tonight.
- We're doing quite good.
- Good in what?
Sex, work, love.
What else?
What else could be needed?
What makes me happy most, you think?
For sure, success.
Why are you looking at me that way,
what's going on?
Are you reading a new book
or something?
Or has a new trend in philosophy arisen
that I couldn't follow?
Ece, we cannot even discuss with you.
Isn't it better not to discuss?
Why would we feel bad?
No possibility for his call tonight
anymore.
But I deserve this,
since I'm an easy woman.
Don't be ridicolus.
- Hi Zeynep.
- Hi Esra, I'm at home.
- You arrived.
- You won't call him, OK?
OK, I won't, don't worry.
Good night, dear.
Wait for a while. He will call.
The person you're calling cannot be
reached at the moment.
Damn you, Esra!
I'm sleeping.
It doesn't matter whether or not we act
coyly, none of it works, I'm confused.
The best is being a lesbian.
A shark will get into the 3rd frame.
We'll put it in the middle of
Istiklal Street, right above the crowd.
It should be fast enough.
- I enjoyed the meeting very much.
- Yeah, we'll see good come-outs.
- How was the launch?
- Good.
- What did you do while I was away?
- Nothing.
We need a meeting with you as well,
in the afternoon. OK?
OK.
He just passed by me...
...as if I was not there.
Even not looking with one eye.
In fact he was walking with Ece, but...
You tell it already, it's because
that Ece was nearby him. Don't worry.
Hey, we'll go the opening
of Arca tonight.
Opening of Arca?
Let me notjoin you.
I don't want to hear any objection.
We'll have fun.
OK.
See you.
You the junior bitch!
There's an event tonight
that we have to join.
I can't come, too many things to do.
But Suzan is the co-sponsor
of the event.
But still, feel free.
Here I am.
- He didn't call yet.
- He will.
But you haven't dressed yet.
Move, be quick!
Didem, what if I don'tjoin you?
You know, I don't like those events.
Everybody's looking at who's come
with whom, who's wearing what.
How nice! We'll have fun.
Go and get dressed, soon!
Come on!
Zeynep?
- What happened?
- We quarreled!
I told you that he would take fire!
Why did you quarrel?
He's gone crazy with having a kid!
He's thinks it's getting late
for being a father.
He wants to be a young father!
Then I packed my stuff and left home.
He even didn't ask me to stay.
This is over!
He is right.
What are you talking about?
You'll see, how I'll make life
miserable to him.
He cannot even sleep,
cannot breathe without me!
- Zeynep!
- He'll call shortly.
He'll call but I will not answer.
Would we go to Erdi's place together
so that you you might recover a little bit.
No.
Come on, your mood will improve.
Come on.
Come on.
OK.
Let me get dressed then.
I've told her many times but
she doesn't take into consideration.
- Always on her own way...
- And you talk like this. Not appropriate.
Up to me...
...love is the sense that the person...
...who sets up the right strategy
in the relationship feels.
Up to me love is what you feel
when you understand that...
...there is no need for a strategy.
Up to me you both are wrong.
Love is the situation that the idiot
who makes a strategic mistake...
...and realizes it very late, gets into.
Come on.
Love, passion, jealousy.
Those are all exaggerated feelings.
What matters to me is...
...a common view of life of 2 people.
- You think so, Mrs. Logic?
- Yes.
Listen. You'll go too old in your 40's.
Even Botox wouldn't work for you then.
- Very funny!
- I don't think I can live that far.
You listen to this: at least
I will not be alone in my 40's!
Really?
- Well, Ergun didn't call yet.
- Come on.
See, all what I've predicted
have come out right!
He will call!
- He will. He will.
- Will he?
Did you call Ergun?
We did, my dear.
He's coming here shortly, right?
Yeah, he's coming, we called him.
Ergun.
Zeynep.
Here I am, darling.
- Here he is.
- He is here.
Darling.
Darling.
- We solved it, right?
- We did.
Let's go home.
Not home,
let's go for our honeymoon.
Girls, we're leaving.
Have fun.
I can't believe my eyes, Cem is here!
Look at this, he has a girlfriend!
Don't you know we're unlucky girls?
I am, like an idiot...
I want to cry now.
All my energy is down!
Do you see? He's flirting with the girl
and waving at me. What the hell is this?
Could you please calm down?
Look... He's still smiling at me...
No, I won't be able to calm down.
Please don't even think of going there
and telling something.
Don't block me Esra.
Do you want to humiliate yourself?
I have to go the ladies. Come on. Move.
Be back soon, I'm waiting for you.
Why do you keep smiling at me?
- Sorry?
- What's your purpose?
I don't have a purpose.
Must all the girls be interested in you?
Who are you?
So called "actor"! Faker!
In your interviews you pretend to be
bored of superficial relationships...
...and looking for a real love etc.
What to do with you...
...looking at other
girls while your girlfriend's...
Dear brother, my friends arrived,
I'm leaving, OK?
OK sweetie.
Bye!
Take care. Don't be too late.
- OK.
"Dear brother."
So you're siblings.
I'm... so sorry...
Didem, I want to know you.
Let's not leave this to chance
anymore. OK?
Come with me...
Just 2 minutes in the ladies...
What's going on?
Poor girl, she collapsed.
Today she cried in the toilet saying that
he didn't even look at my face.
How can you go leaving me there alone?
How can you cheat me
with a girl like this?
Would you mind if I had cheated
with Adriana Lima?
Don't make fun of me!
Your standards have notably declined!
I'm gonna sleep.
- Hello. Is the project file ready?
- Yes.
Thanks to your talent,
that's wonderful.
Your drawings are also very nice.
Not only mine, thanks to
the efforts of both of us.
Oh no. They know that
I cannot create such ideas.
They're looking for an opportunity
to kick me off.
Our sector is too slippery,
suddenly you fall down on the floor.
Even I could understand in such a short time
how dishonest everybody is.
Here it is, you've realized it soon.
By the way,
you will present the project.
- Me?
- You.
- I can't.
- You can. You have to.
Because I have to go out
in a few minutes.
I want to jump to another agency
before they kick me off.
At least, to preserve my honor.
Wish me luck for my interview.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Our president Ali. And Esra.
Nice to meet you.
Me, too.
Let's see what you've done
in such a short period of time.
Well in fact, you're quite good in this.
- We thought that...
- We?
Somebody else we cannot see?
We prepared it together with Sevgul.
She had to leave urgently...
...so asked me to present.
Listening to you.
If the topic is gold,
all women look for the top.
Therefore, we decided to use a
celebrity Russian athlete who...
...has targeted the top and
won hundreds of gold medals.
She has demonstrated to the whole world
what a woman can do for gold.
Besides, she is a very
beautiful lady and...
...valuable enough to be able to
put on our product.
I couldn't understand.
How will we use this...
...so called "beautiful lady"
in our advertisement?
Like this: Worn a fancy evening dress,
at the moment of high-jumping...
...we see her golden jewels
around her neck and arm.
At the end of the film,
there is a very long champion-desk...
...on which stand our athlete and
many other women altogether.
We say "Because all women deserve
the champion's quality," and conclude it.
Up to me, this is perfect.
What do you think, Mert?
I agree with you that those are
brilliant ideas. I am jealous.
Films, billboards etc. based on this idea
will all come up very good.
I'm sure Suzan
will also like this very much.
- Happy that you liked it.
- Thanks.
There is another project I guess,
let's see it, too.
This?
This is...
...my resignation.
Thanks for listening.
Esra!
Esra, could you please get in the car?
Please get in.
Damn it! Move!
Esra.
Esra! Wait for me.
Esra, one moment please.
Nothing takes place as you imagine.
- I don't have a relation with Ece as you...
- Don't explain me anything.
What I saw last night
was enough for me.
I'm very sorry.
I tried to explain you but
everything's proceeded so fast.
I trusted on you.
How could you do this to me?
All what I have lived with you was real,
believe me.
I don't believe in you.
Wish I haven't met you.
Please don't talk like this.
There must be something I can do.
Yes there is. Get out of my life!
Have the fonts
in the billboards changed?
Yes it has.
Would you like to print them?
Yes, please.
My love and work life that I've squeezed
into 5 days have ended dramatically.
To ease my pain a little bit could only
become possible by writing.
When I realized this,
I started to write my own story.
LOVE PUZZLE
Although I've written a novel
based on love...
...I'm a lonely woman
who has lost her hope for love.
Because you either live or write love.
As you can see, I'm one of those
who had to write!
I hope you like it. Thanks.
- To your success, my friend.
- Thanks.
How packed it was.
Women did a good job.
It's my friend who wrote the book.
Of course it will be packed, right?
Who invited him?
Jerk!
Esra my dear, bravo!
This book is amazing.
Congratulations.
I knew that you would be successful.
I am proud of you.
By the way, I broke up with my fiancée.
I want you back.
You want me back.
He wants me back!
He wants her back!
Take this. Take.
Give me the book.
No books for you! Move!
My dear...
Did you accept this prize
in the name of me?
I was talking about a woman with a heart.
Why did you take it for yourself?
What do you mean?
You must have understood already.
It's over.
I am waiting for my compensation,
you know this.
The prize can be yours.
I cannot go on anymore.
You don't mean to quit working
in the agency, right?
This is exactly the reaction that
can be expected from you.
She said "You whether live or write
the love,"and slapped her ex-boyfriend."
Girls! "Mert Demir,
while taking his prize said...
...this prize does not belong to me but...
to a woman with a great heart."
This is very romantic.
Esra, this man is in love with you.
Don't be ridiculous girls,
he has no idea on love!
Come on Esra.
Look at the man,
he's absolutely in love.
If a woman is writing such a note
it means, she is in love with you.
And if you think about this woman
and smile when you find this note...
...it means, you are also
in love with her.
On the other hand, despite smiling,
if you have missed such a woman...
...it means you are an idiot.
Come on girls, be quick.
We have only half an hour left.
She's got a job by means of you.
Hello.
Yes, I'm the manager of Cem.
How can I help you?
Oh, you are his fan, I see...
Then let me put you through
his girlfriend. One second please.
Hi. This is Didem, Cem's girlfriend.
On those issues, next time, please...
She turned off.
She is sick.
It's the belt.
If a man, accepting that he's an idiot,
is writing this note...
...and waiting in the cue ignoring
how long it is...
...it means he is in love with you.
And if you are getting excited
while reading this note...
...it means you are also in love with him.
And most importantly, if you still
have not punched on his face...
...it means, the situation is hopeful!
Are you curious about
what happened next?
Here I am, my dear.
You will pay for this.
Sorry baby.
It hurts so much.
I promise, I will be the surrogate mother
for you next time.
- "Thanks god, it's done nicely!"
- She's not circumcised, she's giving birth!
It's OK. Everything will be OK.
Here we are. That's all.
Erdi, stand up! Wake up!
It's like a joke!
We are aunts now!
Yes, what you see is true:
Our new agency.
Pinar and many others work here.
This is our home.
The handsome man dealing
with the barbecue is my darling.
He offered me marriage
but I still haven't replied yet.
We will see.
Come on my baby, eat a little bit.
Or your mother...
You cannot even feed the baby!
Give it to me.
You couldn't stand without moving
for 5 minutes.
I cannot draw since the wind
makes them move.
I think I'm extremely untalented.
You used to paint very well;
why don't you give me some hints?
This is an inherited talent, dear.
What about exploring and improving
some other talents of you?
Where are those girls, I'm bored!
Hi everybody, here I am!
He hasn't used his hands
to stuff them, right?
- You stuffed them?
- Yes!
Thanks, I don't want.
By the way, tomorrow we all will be
flying for the World Cup Final.
All the expenses will be afforded
by Yigit.
Is there anybody who knows the reason?
Let me tell you something.
If these men are all not queer,
I am not queer either.
Sorry girls!
I'm a real jerk!
Listen Didem.
I love you. I swear.
- We'll make the presentation. Right, Demir?
- Mr. Demir!
Stop for a moment!
- How calm I can be? Esra!
- Then you carry her!
OK. She's my friend.
- Then one more game.
- OK.
Good. But let me take your arm,
as I see it's a betterjoystick.
Yes, it's longer.
Hey, this is a very ugly joke.
This game is not played with arm.
Wish it were possible...
You might have defeated me
if it was possible. Right?
- You're right.
- Come on, start!
- How often do you play with joystick?
- Quite often.
Do you play with joystick
when you're alone?
Do you play with your own joystick?
You use it very well, you've solved it.
I'm coming from Commodore 64.
And me, from the toilet.
- Oh, this is too ugly.
- Too awful...
