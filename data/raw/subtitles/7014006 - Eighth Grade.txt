Hey, guys! Uh, it's Kayla.
Back with another video.
Okay, um, so
first thing's first is, um...
I haven't been getting, like,
a lot of views
or whatever on my videos,
so if you guys could share,
like with your
friends and stuff,
I would really,
really appreciate it.
Uh, okay, so the topic of
today's video
is "being yourself,"
and it's like, you know,
well, aren't I
always being myself?
And like, yeah. For sure.
Um, but, uh...
Sorry, I... I'm
reading these off paper.
Um, okay...
But it's like,
being yourself is, like,
not changing yourself
to impress someone else.
You know, because, like, um,
like, uh, you could be
the most popular kid
at school or, like,
you know, like, um,
have, like,
the hottest boyfriend
or whatever, um,
but, like, what's the point
if you're not being yourself?
And it's like
being yourself can be hard.
And, like, the hard part
about being yourself
is that it's not always easy
because, you know, like,
people can, like, um,
like, make fun of you,
or something dumb.
Because, like, people suck
and evil people exist.
Um, but you just
got to ignore them
and, like, not care
what they're saying.
Um...
And...
Like, for instance, like...
You know, a lot of people,
like, call me quiet or shy
or whatever, um,
but I'm not quiet, like,
I... You know, I don't talk
a lot at school, but, um,
I just... It's not like
I'm scared to not talk,
I just don't want to.
But if, like, people actually,
you know, like, be my friend,
like, you know,
talk to me and stuff,
they'd find out
that I'm, like,
really funny
and cool and talkative.
And, yeah, I'm just...
I'm not, like, quiet.
I just choose
not to talk a lot at school,
like other people, you know?
Um...
Okay, so, yeah, uh...
I hope that, basically,
you know, like, be yourself
and don't care about,
like, whatever...
What other people
think about you.
And just, like,
you know, ignore them
if they're being mean
to you about it.
And everything will work out
if you're just being yourself.
Uh, okay. Thank you, guys,
for watching this video.
I hope some of you guys
found it helpful.
And make sure to subscribe
to my channel. Bleh.
Um, and, yeah.
Thank you for watching.
Gucci.
Hey, guys,
welcome back to my channel.
Today I'm giving a tutorial
on my "going out" look.
So, this is kind of
my standard look
that I always do.
So, if you want to see what I
do, then just keep watching.
Over the course
of these next 30 minutes,
we will begin to explore
and understand these
changing bodies of yours.
It's gonna be lit.
Chapter One.
The Hair Down There.
Pubic hair
or pubes...
...are heavier, longer,
more coarse hairs
that develop during puberty.
Tristan,
are you masturbating?
I wasn't masturbating!
Guys, stop being weird. Stop
being weird. Stop being weird.
Hey. Settle down.
Eight graders, next week
is your last week
here at Miles Grove
Middle School...
- LeBron James.
- Yes. Yeah.
But we also have
a lot of important work
in front of us.
And some fun work
in front of us.
And we also have your
sixth-grade time capsules.
Remember when you
made those shoeboxes
the first week of sixth grade?
Remember how we said it would
be a gift to your future you
when you finally made it
here at Miles Grove
Middle School?
Well, you have made it.
So, pick those up in the lobby
after this assembly's over.
Now I'm going to hand things

Hey, yellow shirt!
Hi!
Come here.
Hi. Yes, you, come here.
Hi. You're Mark's girl, right?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
Your dad was such a huge help
with the spring fundraiser.
Thank him again for me,
will you?
- I will.
- What's your name again?
- Kayla.
- Right, Kayla.
Hey, so we
just opened our pool...
- Mom!
- Shush!
We just opened our pool,
and we are going to have
our first big
summer pool party
tomorrow to celebrate
Kennedy's birthday.
It's gonna be so much fun,
- right, Kennedy?
- Yep.
Oh, you should come.
It's gonna be a blast.
Kennedy will invite you
on Facebook.
- Right, Kennedy?
- No one uses Facebook anymore.
Anyway, do you think
you can come, or...
Oh, I mean, uh... Maybe.
I'll try, but,
you know, probably not.
Oh, no, no. You should come.
It's gonna be a blast.
But don't forget to thank
your dad for me, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So, you're gonna...
We'll see you tomorrow
maybe, or...
Um, yeah. Yeah, I'll try,
you know...
I mean, I'd like to.
I just don't know if I can.
Oh, no, no, you'll be there.
Okay, see you tomorrow.
- Say goodbye, Kennedy.
- Bye.
Bye.
Kayla.
- Kayla!
- What?
- Food's getting cold.
- I like it cold.
One more week
of eighth grade, huh?
Huh?
I said one more week
of eighth grade, right?
Yeah.
- That's crazy.
- Yeah. Huh.
I can't believe you're gonna
be in high school.
- Mmm-hmm.
- How did that happen?
I don't know.
You excited?
Yes.
Yes. Yes, I'm very excited.
I'm so excited.
Hey, I got an email
from Mrs. Graves.
Huh?
I got an email
from Mrs. Graves
that said you're
going to go to
Kennedy's birthday
thing tomorrow?
No.
- Really?
- Yeah, no.
- It sounded kinda fun.
- Kennedy doesn't like me.
- That can't be true.
- Cool.
Sometimes kids act
like they don't like you,
but it's really just 'cause
they got their own stuff
going on, and they don't...
Kayla.
Kayla...
Are you kidding me right now?
- I'm just being funny.
- Dad, no! It's not funny!
You're the only one
that thinks it's funny!
You don't think I'm funny?
Dad!
Dad, it's a Friday.
You said I could do
whatever I want on Fridays.
- And right now...
- Okay,
you're right. Okay, I did.
All right. Can I say
one thing, though?
Then you can go back to your
phone, I'll leave you alone.
- I just want to say one thing.
- Fine!
Okay, but you have to
let me finish saying it.
Yeah, I will. I'm not even...
You can't get angry
before I finish saying it,
otherwise you won't listen.
- Fine. Just say it.
- All right. All right. Okay.
Okay.
- Are you gonna say it?
- I'm thinking.
I think you're so cool.
I think you're so...
I'm gonna stop eating
with you if you...
Hey, I said... You said
I could say one thing.
Can I say one thing, please?
- Fine.
- Thank you.
Look, when I as your age,
I was not cool like you.
You have all these interests
and your videos
and, just, how you express
yourself in them,
it's so... It's just so cool.
It's so great,
and I just... I just think...
Maybe you just need
to put yourself
out there a little bit more.
Please stop.
I know the kids
at school are not great.
I'm not saying you have to be
best friends
with Kennedy Graves.
And I know this is
gonna sound lame,
but I just think you're
a really special person.
- Dad...
- And I know it's like,
you know,
all dads think that.
But even if I wasn't your dad,
I would still think that.
- I would. I'm sorry.
- Dad!
- I'm sorry. I would.
- Dad!
This is more than one thing.
It's a chunk of things...
...and I know it's like,
"Dad, shut up.
"Duh, shut up."
I get it. Please, I get it.
But I'm actually not saying
this to make you feel bad.
I'm saying it
to make you feel better.
You know what'd
make me feel better?
- What?
- Is if you'd let me
go on my phone.
Okay, fine.
- Go ahead. Do your thing.
- Thanks.
Uh...
I'm just going to bed.
Okay.
Okay.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Are you...
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I just...
Next time,
can you please knock?
Yeah, sure. Sorry.
I did...
Well, uh...
Do it louder or something.
I don't know.
For sure. Yeah. Got it.
Sorry. Good night.
Good night.
Please...
Shit. Shit!
Hey, guys. Kayla back here
with another video.
Uh, okay, so the topic
of today's video is
"Putting Yourself Out There."
Um, okay. So, like,
what does that mean?
Where is "there"?
Well, "there" can be anywhere
that you wouldn't usually go.
You know, maybe because it's,
like, weird or scary or, um,
something like that.
Um, okay, and now you're
probably thinking, like,
you know, well,
"Why would I want to go
somewhere like that?"
And there's actually
lots of reasons.
Uh, one reason
is that people might not know,
like, the real you.
Like, if you only ever see,
you know, some people
at school or something,
then those people are only
going to know the school you.
But if you put yourself
out there
and you go to places
you wouldn't usually go,
people can know the movie you
or the pool you
or the party you
or the weekend you.
All the yous that
make up the real you.
Like, for example,
this one time I was having
a bunch of friends over,
and my dad made me invite this
one weird girl, or whatever,
and, you know, I didn't really
want to invite her
because at school
she was just always weird,
so I didn't like her.
But my dad made me invite her,
so then she came over,
and I got to know
the real her.
And she actually was
really cool and funny.
- Kayla!
- And, like, just awesome.
And all my friends were just,
like, "Who is she?"
And everyone was just, like,
talking about her
the whole time.
So, yeah. And...
I guess that's basically
what I was trying to say,
like, you know, you just need
to put yourself out there
and, like, face your fears
and, you know,
let people know the real you.
And, like, it doesn't matter
if you're scared
because everyone's
gonna be scared.
Uh... Okay, uh, hope... Bleh.
Hopefully some of you guys
found this video helpful,
and if you like it,
make sure to click "like"
and subscribe to my channel.
Thanks for watching.
Gucci.
Tyler, stop. Stop. Tyler!
- No. No.
- Stop. Stop.
Aiden!
All the way.
Did it all the way.
What?
I swam all the way across
the pool underwater.
- Cool.
- Yeah. You know,
I could have went further
if I wanted to, but whatever.
- Wanna see me do a handstand?
- Uh...
Too many people in the pool.
Can't do it for long
if the water isn't still.
I'm Gabe. What's your name?
Uh, I'm Kayla.
Okay. Yeah, cool.
I'm going to try again.
Yeah. Water's not calm enough.
- Yeah.
- So, how do you know Kennedy?
Oh, we go to school together.
Oh, okay. Yeah.
That's cool. She's my cousin.
Want to do
a breath-holding contest?
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay, cool.
One, two, three...
I won.
Okay, so the trick is,
don't move at all
because when you move
your body uses oxygen.
Okay. Picture time!
- Ugh!
- Oh, shush, Kennedy.
Girls first.
Come on, girls. Gather round,
over there
by the diving board.
She said
all the girls over there.
- Oh, yeah. Right.
- Yeah.
No boys allowed.
All right. Yes, okay.
Let's all get in together.
Great. Okay.
Wait. Kayla, I can't see you,
sweetie. Come up front.
There you go.
Okay. And cheese!
Cheese!
Yay!
- This is for you.
- Oh, my God.
I'm so excited!
It's, like, so you.
Oh, my God. Dude!
Oh, my God.
- So cute!
- It's so you.
It'll look
so good on you.
I know. I love it.
And this one's
from Kayla.
She's right over there.
What is it?
Uh, it's a card game. Um...
It's actually really fun.
Like, everyone gets ten cards
and you take turns, like...
Uh, it's like Go Fish,
except a lot more fun.
Okay. This one's from Julia.
- Happy birthday to you.
- No, Mike!
- Oh, my God. No, no!
- Mike! Come on, Mike...
- What? What?
- It's not time yet.
It's time. I brought it
down from the kitchen.
I got it all over my shirt.
- It's time to eat! What?
- Mike.
- Oh, my God!
- I picked this thing up
at 8:00 in the goddamn
morning! Eat it!
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.
Dad, can you please
just come get me?
No, the party's over.
I don't know how it ended,
Dad, okay?
It's just kind of, like, over.
My God.
Dad, I'm the last one
here, okay?
Can you please
just come get me?
- Are you whispering?
- No, I'm not whispering.
It's just
really bad reception here.
Okay, listen,
I can get there...
Just come get me, please.
- All right. In an hour.
- Can you please come quicker?
I'll try...
Fine. Whatever. Fine.
Just text me when you're here
and don't come inside.
Okay. Are you okay?
Is everything all right?
All right. Yeah.
- You sure?
- Thanks.
- What?
- Thanks, I said.
- Okay, I love you.
- All right. Bye.
- Love you too.
- Kayla, is everything...
Ow.
Oh, sorry.
No.
I just gotta...
What?
Was just grabbing my phone.
Had to charge it.
Yeah. Sometimes I charge it,
too. My phone. I...
Yeah, sometimes my phone
runs out of batteries, too.
You know, everyone's in there.
Oh, that's where
everyone is. Okay. Uh...
I'll go out there in a second.
Okay.
Hey, guys. It's Kayla, back
here with another video.
Okay, so the topic of today's
video, which is super cool,
is, "How To Be Confident."
Ow.
So, um...
I think one thing a lot of
people think about confidence
is that, like, you know,
you're born with it.
You either are confident
or you're not.
You know, just like how
some people are tall.
You're either
tall or short.
But it's not like that,
actually.
Confidence is a choice.
Like, the really awesome thing
about confidence is that
you can just start
acting like it,
even if you feel like
you don't have any.
For example, I used to, like,
not be confident at all.
But then one day, I'm like,
"Hmm, I want to be confident."
So, then I just kind of
started acting like it,
and then it made me feel good,
and then I actually
started being confident.
Like, without trying.
And, like, a big part of being
confident is being brave,
and you can't be brave
unless you're scared.
So, for those of you who are
feeling scared
about being confident,
that's actually a big part
of confidence, to be scared.
That's normal.
Because you can't be brave
without being scared.
So, go out there
and just be, like, confident.
And if you
don't feel confident,
just do it anyways.
Make yourself confident.
Okay, so as always
please share
and subscribe to my channel
if you guys liked the video,
and thanks for watching.
Gucci.
Oh, hey.
Oh, hey.
What's your name again?
Oh, yeah. Oh, hey, totally.
Yeah. Yeah, I'd be
totally up for that.
Yeah, that would...
That would be, like, great.
Yeah.
So, um... Yeah.
Someone said that?
That's so dumb.
So, like, dumb. I just...
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
I'd be totally up for that.
That'd be so fun.
Yeah, oh...
Yeah, it was... It was great.
Yeah, it was so fun.
Oh... Oh, so that happened.
Okay.
So that's why
you couldn't make it.
No, I mean, that's fine.
Yeah, of course.
I'd love to come.
Yeah, it'd be great if
we could just, like, do that
on, like, Wednesday
or something.
- Really?
- Yes.
Uh, Kennedy. Hey.
Um... So, thanks
for inviting me to your party.
No problem.
By the way, I like your shirt
a lot. It's so cool.
I have a shirt, too...
Mmm-hmm.
Also, you know,
I, like, um...
I wrote this, like, letter
for you and whatever,
so if you want to have it,
it's, like, a thank you.
Oh, hey, Steph.
What?
Hey.
Hi...
Hey, well, thanks for talking
to me, you guys, um...
Catch you later.
Cool.
- Oh, my God!
- Bang! Dead!
Bang! Dead!
Bang! Dead!
Okay...
Hey, how about
let's give it up
for the volunteers
from the drama club.
What do you say?
Okay, kids.
We've gone over
what you should do
if you hear gunshots
in the distance.
And what are we supposed
to do in that situation?
Run
in the opposite direction.
You sure about that?
- Hello?
- Yes. Positive!
Okay.
But now we're gonna talk about
what you should do
when the gunshots are close.
Listen up, mister. Um...
You know, when the shooter's
down the hallway or
right outside the classroom.
What you just saw
was an example
of what not to do. Okay?
If the gunshots
are loud and close,
and you're in a classroom
or a bathroom,
uh, you should
do the following...
Stay put,
turn off the lights...
Are you
staring at Aiden?
Huh?
I said,
are you staring at Aiden?
- No.
- He's a dick.
He dumped Chelsea because
she wouldn't send him
naked pictures.
Oh. That's weird.
...with the dead or wounded.
Coach Red to the main office.
Coach Red
to the main office, please.
Okay, everyone.
That's the signal.
Please be respectful
of the drill and stay quiet.
Should only be a few minutes.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Uh, whatcha doing?
Playing a game.
Cool. Cool. Um...
Uh, are you excited
for high school?
- Yeah. Should be cool.
- Yeah.
You ever think there'd be
a real shooting here?
I wish.
Same. Um... Like...
Why do you wish there was one?
'Cause I'd fuck him up.
Take his gun and elbow him
right in the jaw, lay him out.
I wouldn't be a pussy
and sit under my desk.
Yeah, you
would fuck him up.
He'd be,
like, totally screwed.
Yeah.
Oh, my God,
that was so embarrassing.
Like, it's super funny.
You won't, like...
It was so funny,
Aiden, I just...
Like, yeah, it was really
funny what just happened.
What?
It's kind of just
too embarrassing for me
to even, like, talk about.
- I mean...
- Okay.
I mean, I just... I was
trying to open up Instagram,
and then I ended up pulling up
my dirty photos folder,
- and it was just...
- Really?
Yeah.
What was it of?
Just...
Just, you know, like...
- Me.
- Doing what?
I don't know. Just, you know,
like, hanging out.
- Can I see it?
- No, no.
It's only
for my boyfriend to see.
Who's your boyfriend?
Uh, he's... Uh...
You know, like,
right now he's off...
Well, I mean, I don't
really have one right now,
but, you know, like,
I'm saving some dirty photos
to, like, send him
when I do have one.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You give blowjobs?
Uh...
Kayla.
To answer your question, I do,
and I'm, like,
really good at them.
Hi, I'm Dr. Kat,
and I'm here
to give you some tips
for performing oral sex
on him.
First off, you...
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.
You didn't.
Whatcha up to?
Nothing.
Cool.
School was good?
Yeah.
Good.
Hey, you know
who I ran into today?
Do you remember
that guy who...
- Is that a banana?
- What?
What?
You're having a banana?
Oh, this, I was just
grabbing a banana.
I thought you hated bananas.
No.
I swear, like, a month ago
I asked you
if you wanted a banana,
and you got all angry
at me, and you said
you hate bananas, and I always
forget that you hate bananas.
I actually think
I wrote a note
down about it on my app thing,
so I wouldn't
- forget...
- Uh...
I don't hate them anymore.
Hmm. That's great.
Yeah. I'll just
eat it right now.
Who cares?
Are you sure you like them?
Mmm-hmm.
Honey, you don't look...
Fine! I don't like
bananas. Okay?
Yeah?
Hey.
Hi.
How ya doin'?
Good.
Good.
So, oh, you got the, uh,
high school thing tomorrow,
right? The shadow thing?
- Yeah.
- That's cool.
That should be fun.
Yeah.
Nice.
Yeah.
Yeah...
All right, I can't wait
to hear about it.
Yeah.
All right. Well,
I'm going to bed.
Love you.
Don't stay up too late.
Hey...
Just so you know,
you don't, well...
I'm not mad, but...
Just so you know,
you don't need to, like,
worry about me anymore
because I'm actually doing
really great right now,
and my life is really amazing.
Cool.
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.
Okay. Uh... Good night.
Okay. Good night.
- I love you.
- Love you too.
Dear God,
tomorrow is...
Tomorrow is a really,
really important day for me,
and I really need it...
I really need you
to make it a good day.
I mean...
I understand that
every day can't be,
like, a great day, um...
But I really need tomorrow
to be a good one.
I mean, even if you give me
a ton of, like,
really bad days in the future
or something, um,
just as long as tomorrow
can be a really good day.
All right, uh... That's all.
Thank you.
Love, Kayla.
Okay.
Settle down! Settle down!
You are here for the High
School Shadow Program.
We're gonna
walk in there as a group,
and you're gonna be
individually paired
with a high school student.
Now, you are to stay
with that student
for the entire school day.
You are not, repeat,
not to leave their side.
So please be respectful
and take it all in.
This is your chance
to get a glimpse
of what life will be like
for you next year.
So, pay attention
and have fun.
Kayla?
- Hi!
- Hey, hey. I'm Olivia.
- Hi, I'm Kayla.
- I'm gonna hug you.
- Okay.
- Okay, cool.
Yeah, this is gonna be so fun.
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!
You nervous? Like, you don't
have to be nervous.
- Sorry.
- No, no, no. Don't be sorry.
I'm... I'm nervous.
Like, I want you to have fun.
Um, yeah. Okay, cool.
This is gonna be great.
High school is boring
and, like, horrible,
but, like, also amazing.
- And it's gonna be great.
- Okay.
People are awesome.
You're gonna be...
Okay, this is gonna be so fun.
Okay. You're so cute.
Okay, let's go,
let's do this, okay?
- Um...
- Yo, Liv. Martin got it.
- Shut up.
- I'm serious.
- Oh, my God. Um...
- What was that?
That's just
a stupid inside joke.
Um... Babs.
Babs, uh, did you...
Did you do that thing
for Kiley's class?
- Fuck no.
- Thank God.
Um...
Anyway...
Yeah. So do you have
any questions for me?
No. No, I mean...
- Well, does...
- You don't have
- to have a question.
- Okay.
Oh, my God, you're so cute.
I feel like
we're best friends.
Is it weird
if we're already best friends?
No. No. Yeah... Yeah.
Hey, guys.
It's Kayla,
back with another video.
So today, I want to talk
to you guys about growing up.
Okay, so growing up can be
a little bit scary and weird,
but it's also
a really good thing
because you get
to change things
that you might not
like about yourself,
and that's good because
change is a good thing.
Okay, so I'm an eighth-grader,
which means next year
I will be in high school.
Now, high school is a lot
different than middle school
because middle school is like,
really, uh... Well...
Middle school is, like,
in the middle.
And in middle school,
everyone is a lot younger
than high schoolers
and, when you're young,
you haven't changed
as much as when you're older.
So, yeah,
high schoolers have changed
more than middle schoolers,
and since change
is a good thing,
that means that high schoolers
are really good.
Uh...
Okay, uh, next thing
about growing up...
Yeah, okay. Uh...
So the thing about growing up
is that it's going to happen,
so don't fight it.
Some parts of growing up
will be really hard
and not good,
but I promise that growing up
will eventually
get really good.
I mean, I used to be afraid
of growing up,
and then I realized it's going
to make everything better,
and now I can't wait
to grow up.
Uh, yeah. Cool.
Uh, okay. Uh...
Thank you, guys,
for watching this video,
and make sure to share
and subscribe to my channel.
Uh, yeah. Thank you, guys,
for watching.
Gucci.
Hey, Olivia...
Hey, Olivia.
Uh...
Thanks for today.
Hey.
Uh...
Yeah, I mean totally.
No, I mean,
like, honestly, like...
Screw those girls,
they're just, like,
trying so hard to be cool.
Pretty much.
No. I mean it, Kayla.
Don't stress about that stuff.
Okay. I'll... I'll try not to.
No. Eighth grade is the worst.
I was, like, a complete mess
when I was your age.
- Really?
- Yes. Oh, my God, yes.
Wow, I mean...
Wow, um...
Oh, also, thanks for letting
me, like, call you and stuff
because I wasn't sure if I,
you know, like, should
or if that would be, like,
you know, weird or not.
Oh, my God, no, no, no, no.
Not weird at all. I gave you
my number, Kayla.
This is...
This is what it's for.
Thanks. I mean,
it's just really nice
and kind of, like,
just awesome to be able...
To be able to, like,
you know, talk to someone
who's just so,
like, cool and they're, like,
older and stuff.
Oh, my God, well, you know,
I don't know
how cool I am.
Uh, I mean, I actually think
you're pretty cool. I mean...
I...
I... I don't really
have, like,
a lot of friends
at school or whatever
because, like, people are,
like, stupid like you said.
Um... But, I don't know,
you've just been so nice to me
and you're just...
I think... I think that
makes you pretty cool.
I mean, I made all my close
friends in high school.
All that's stuff
is gonna happen for you.
Don't even worry about it.
Thanks.
You know, hey, um...
I don't know if you're around
or allowed or whatever,
but me and some friends
are heading to the mall
to just, like, hang,
if you feel like
you wanna come.
Kayla?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Okay...
Oh, crap.
Uh, hey, sorry about that.
Uh, I have, like,
really, really bad reception
at my house. Um...
But if it's still cool
if I hang out?
Oh, my gosh, yes. Please come.
Oh, okay. Okay, cool. Cool.
Cool. Cool. Cool. Awesome.
Great. Okay. Uh...
Yeah, uh...
- Text me later.
- Yeah! Okay, see ya!
- Okay. See you. Bye.
- Okay, bye.
Cool. Yeah.
Oh, fuck.
- Dad?
- Yeah? What's up?
Is something wrong?
Can I go out
with friends tonight?
Can you not
look like that, please?
What?
Like what?
Just, like, the way
you're looking.
Looking at the road?
You can look at the road, Dad.
I obviously didn't mean that.
Just, like, don't be weird
and quiet while you do it.
Sorry.
Hey, how was
the shadow thing...
No, you were being quiet,
which is fine.
Just, like,
don't be weird and quiet
because, like, I look over
at you, and I think
you're about to drive us
into a tree or something,
and then I get
really freaked out,
and then I can't
text my friends.
So just, like,
be quiet and drive.
And don't look weird and sad.
Please.
Okay.
That's worse.
...that was two years ago.
He's still dead.
- Think of it.
- I'm acknowledging that.
I'm just saying,
what, we have a triathlon
for a kid that died
- two years ago?
- Okay...
No one
was running for him then.
He was fat then.
- Oh, my God...
- I don't get why,
like, everyone has to act like
they're his best friend.
- No, it's like...
- Oh, my God...
He died. His whole
future was stripped from him.
Did you just
put a candle down...
That doesn't mean
he was a special person.
Oh, my God,
you are the most...
You are
such an insensitive asshole.
He's dead!
You guys
are just following...
We're following...
We're following?
- Hey.
- Oh, my God, Kayla!
Wait, hi. Guys, guys, guys...
Okay, so this is Kayla.
Sorry.
She's, like, super chill
and amazing
and also she's my shadow.
And, um, yeah, this is Aniyah,
and you guys met today.
Riley and Trevor.
- Trevor.
- The whole... The whole gang.
- Are you hungry?
- Uh, I'm fine.
Okay, well, we're gonna...
We're gonna eat, I think.
Oh, well,
I'll grab food, then.
Okay. Okay, cool. Cool.
Yay.
My phone...
All that he did was he put
his arm on your shoulder.
That's perv...
Are you defending this perv?
Why are you defending him?
Why would he...
Why would he wanna look at...
- Why would...
- Why wouldn't he?
Oh, my God.
Wait, wait, wait...
Did I tell you guys?
- What?
- Do you know Brian?
- Yeah, of course.
- Your friend, Brian. Right.
We all know Brian.
So, he DM'ed me
the other day, right?
So, I thought it was a regular
DM until I opened it.
It's literally just a picture,
a cropped picture
that I posted the other day,
- of just my feet.
- Of your feet?
- His feet?
- No. My feet. He sent
- me a picture of my feet.
- That is so weird.
Right? Isn't that so creepy?
No, he was... He was
just trying to flirt with you.
He was being nice.
That's not being nice.
That's being pervy.
- He's a perv.
- You know what a perv is.
What's funny
about that, Riley?
I don't know. Just the way
he said it was...
How did he say it?
What? Why am I
being yelled at?
This is yelling to you?
No, this is an adult tone.
This is the volume
that adults use.
Not that quiet, little mouse
shit that you do.
I don't understand why
you can't just speak up
for yourself.
- Riley's a thinker.
- Oh, he's a thinker?
That's what it is?
You know, I used to be, like,
really quiet too.
No, I'm not quiet.
No. You're quiet.
Let him talk
for himself.
I'm not screaming at anybody!
Oh, that's not
screaming, what?
- I was...
- I will record you
and, like, play it back.
Show you that you're yelling.
- Are you bored, Kayla?
- Huh?
You look bored.
- I'm not bored.
- Trev. Stop.
- You don't have to answer.
- What? No.
I'm not judging her.
It's fine. We're boring her.
She's a different generation
than us.
She's not
a different generation.
Yes, she is.
She's four years
younger than us.
Okay, but people who were,
like, four years older than us
felt, like,
fucking 50 years old.
That's, like, blatantly
not true.
- Your sister.
- My sister just sucks.
Okay, but, like,
on top of that,
she didn't have Twitter
in middle school, and we did.
That made us different.
Kayla, you're not
different than us.
Yeah... When did you get
Snapchat? What grade?
Fifth grade.
Fifth grade? What? No, see!
Wait,
so were kids, like,
sending each other, like,
nudes in, like, fifth grade?
No, okay,
that is a weird question.
What? I'm just asking
a question.
That is
a pervy question.
No, that is
what Snapchat is for!
She's seeing dicks
in fifth grade,
she's, like,
wired differently.
She's not wired different.
I'm not saying it's, like,
a bad thing.
I'm just making...
Dude, stop. Stop.
Let's stop this.
- Let's stop this, now.
- Jesus Christ. Fine!
- We're moving on.
- I'm just making a fun point.
Okay, fun point made.
Let's go. Okay.
Dude, don't bring me
into this shit.
I actually like the filters
on Snapchat and stuff.
- Those are cool.
- Yeah. Me too.
Okay, guys, don't all look
at the same time,
but some creepy ass dude
has been staring at us
for so long...
- Oh?
- Don't. Don't...
I see him, in the...
Uh... I left something
in a store. I'll be back.
Do you want me to...
- Really nice.
- What? I didn't do anything.
Okay. Stop.
- Hey, honey.
- Get away from me!
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to spy on you.
I just suck, I...
I'm just...
You see, sometimes,
dads are just really weird
and, uh, I'm just being weird.
Uh, all right. I'm...
You know, I'm just gonna...
You know, I'm just gonna
get out of here.
I'm just gonna go,
and you just
have fun with your friends
and just text me
when you want me
to pick you up.
I'll get a ride home.
Okay.
Yeah. All right, so, yeah.
Just have fun, and, um...
Here, why don't you, um,
take this
and get yourself, like, a...
A pretzel or something.
Okay. I'm just
going to leave it here.
And, uh, yeah.
Just have fun, and...
All right. I'm sorry.
Aniyah and Trev
need to chill.
I know.
It's like I can't
say anything around them.
They can just be
a lot sometimes.
- You have fun tonight, Kayla?
- Yeah. Totally.
Good.
She's just, like, so fun and
easy to be around, isn't she?
Totally.
You know, I was...
I was just, like,
sitting there or whatever,
like, watching you guys eat,
and all I was thinking
was, like,
you guys are just so cool.
I think you're cool!
You wanna
drop her off first?
I mean, you're right here.
Yeah, but it's late.
We should get her home.
No, it's fine.
- Yeah? You sure?
- Yeah.
All good.
Okay, cool.
This was the best.
Let's do it again soon. Um...
You're awesome.
You rule. You're great.
Bye. Uh, good night.
- Good night, Riley.
- Bye.
Olivia's cool, yeah?
Yeah, totally.
She's, like, the best.
Yeah, we're, like,
best friends.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's awesome.
Kind of awkward talking
when you're in the back seat.
Yeah...
Here, uh, hold on.
Uh...
Should I get in the front?
No. No, no, no, it's all good.
So... You excited
about next year?
Yeah, totally.
Yeah. Totally.
I mean, you should be.
You're like
the coolest freshman
I've ever met, and you're not
even a freshman yet.
- Thanks.
- It's crazy.
Yeah. I mean, you should
watch out for guys,
definitely.
Like...
They're gonna try
to pick you up, you know?
- Yeah.
- Really?
Yeah. I mean, definitely.
- Yeah, right.
- No. I'm serious.
Hmm.
Truth or dare?
Uh... What?
Truth or dare?
- You ever play Truth or Dare?
- Oh.
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Uh...
- Truth or dare?
Uh... Truth.
Okay, uh...
How far
have you gone?
- How far have I gone?
- Yeah. Yeah, like, uh...
- First base, or...
- Oh, okay, yeah.
Yeah. Okay. Uh...
I don't know. Do you mean,
like, you know,
all time or, uh, like,
more recent, or...
Let's go all time.
Well, okay then...
Uh... I don't know.
I'd say, like...
You know, third base.
- Whoa!
- Yeah.
Sorry, just kidding.
I meant second, you know.
I get second and third, like,
mixed up a lot, you know.
You're funny.
I mean, it's okay
if you haven't done anything.
Yeah.
You wanna ask me?
Uh... Okay. Yeah.
Uh... How far have you...
Oh, no. No. Truth or dare.
- Right.
- It starts there, and then...
- Duh.
- Yeah.
Uh... Okay, well, uh...
Truth or dare.
I'll take dare.
Okay...
Yeah.
Uh...
Uh... Put this quarter
in your mouth.
Ew!
Yeah. Sorry,
that was gross. Uh...
No, it's...
Okay, well, like, you know...
Uh...
What do you... What do you
want to do? You know.
You can... You can pick.
I don't know. Shit, um...
So much.
I could
take my shirt off?
I mean, that's stupid though.
Is that stupid?
- Uh... No.
- No?
That... That's fine.
Fuck. I feel like
a fucking idiot.
Is it fine
if I take my shirt off?
Yeah? Okay.
I don't know. All right.
Gonna do it.
Truth or dare?
Uh...
Uh... Truth.
You're no fun.
Uh... Sorry.
Uh, okay, well...
Dare.
Take your shirt off.
Uh... I'm not, like,
super comfortable with that.
Well, do you think
I'm comfortable right now?
- I don't know...
- Calm down, relax.
Take a deep breath. Come on.
- Take your shirt off.
- No!
Sorry.
I...
- I'm really sorry.
- It's fine.
- I'm sorry.
- Stop saying you're sorry.
I said it was fine,
dude. Okay?
So, stop saying that, okay?
You know, and now you're gonna
have your first hookup
with some asshole at a party,
and you're not gonna be
good at it,
and he's gonna tell
all his friends about it,
and you're gonna get made
fun of and feel like shit.
- Do you want that?
- No.
This was about you. Okay?
I'm... I'm trying... I was
trying to help you, okay?
I know.
I really appreciate it.
I just...
I'm sorry. I mean...
It was just...
It was a lot at once,
you know. I...
I don't know, I just... I...
I didn't want to do that
right now.
Please don't tell Olivia
about this.
Night.
Hey. How'd it...
Honey?
Kayla?
Hey, guys.
It's Kayla,
back with another video.
Um...
So...
I'm making this video
to just
kind of say that I'm not gonna
be making videos anymore.
Or, you know, I'm taking
a break or something. Um...
And I don't...
I don't know
if anyone is, like,
really watching
or cares, um...
But if you are,
sorry if this is, like,
a bummer to you.
Um... But...
It's the right thing
to do, um...
I started making videos,
you know, to, like,
give tips and stuff.
And, you know,
help you guys out, but...
I don't know.
If I'm being really honest,
I'm probably not, like,
the best person to give advice
because I like, you know,
I like giving advice
and, like, and talking about
doing stuff,
but I can't really
actually do that stuff.
Um...
And... Yeah.
And...
I don't know.
It's just, like...
Um... I'm really, like,
nervous all the time, and...
I...
Like, I could be doing
nothing, and I'm just
nervous. It's like, um...
It's like I could...
I'm waiting in line for, like,
a roller coaster, and
that stupid, like,
butterflies-in-your-stomach
feeling you get, like...
I get that all the time,
and then I never get
the feeling
of after you ride
the roller coaster,
and I...
I try really hard not to feel
that way, um...
But...
I don't know. I just
can't... Um...
So, I think if you guys
are going through,
like, tough times
and stuff, um,
you deserve someone who can
go through tough times
and make themselves
feel better with their advice,
and actually do the stuff
they talk about.
You know, just...
If they can make
themselves feel better,
then maybe they can
help you feel better.
Um...
So, yeah, I think
those are the reasons
why I'm gonna
stop making videos, um...
And, yeah.
I hope you guys all have,
like, you know, good lives,
and maybe
I'll see you guys around.
Bye.
Gucci.
Hey, Kayla! It's you. Kayla.
I'm just making this video
to congratulate you
on finishing eighth grade.
Whoo-hoo!
I am so, so, so,
so proud of you!
Okay, so I'm making this video
on a Friday.
Um, and, yeah,
Fridays are really fun.
And I'm about to have my first
middle school weekend.
Um...
And I bet it's not really
exciting to you, or whatever,
because you've already
had a bunch
of middle school weekends,
but it's really
exciting to me.
Yeah, I have, like, so many
questions for you also.
Like, do you have a boyfriend?
And is he nice?
Uh, what's the coolest thing
you've done,
or the second coolest thing
you've done?
Uh, yeah, so you don't
have to answer
because I can't
hear you anyways.
But, yeah, thanks
for listening. Bye.
Can you help me burn something
in the backyard?
Yes.
You sure you want to do this?
Yeah.
I'm not exactly sure
what "this" is...
Or means...
I just hope that
whatever we're doing here
is a positive thing?
Yeah.
All right then.
What was in there?
Nothing, really. Um...
Just sort of
my hopes and dreams.
Right.
And you're burning them?
Yeah.
- Do I make you sad?
- What?
No.
No, not at all.
Not at all. Why?
Do I seem sad?
No.
What... Why would you think
you make me sad?
I... I don't know,
it's just...
Sometimes, you know,
I think that when I'm older,
you know,
maybe I'll have
a daughter of my own
or something, and...
I feel like, you know,
if she was like me...
Um...
Then being her mom would
make me sad all the time.
I...
Because, like, you know,
I'd love her
because she's my daughter,
you know, but...
I don't know, I just
think if she turned out
like me that
being her mom would
make me really sad.
You're wrong.
Kayla... Kayla,
hey, look at me.
Look at me. You're wrong.
If you grow up to have
a daughter like you,
she will make you
so, so happy.
Being your dad makes me
so happy, Kayla.
You don't know. You don't know
how happy you make me.
It's beyond... It's...
I can't
describe it. It's, um...
It's so easy to love you.
It's so easy
to be proud of you.
I'm not just saying this.
Hey, I swear to God,
I'm not just saying this.
I mean, sure, sometimes,
if I see you're upset
or having a...
A rough day, then I feel sad.
But...
That kind of being sad,
that sort of
day-to-day sad, or worrying
that I do, that's not...
Kayla, always,
beneath all that, I am always
just so unbelievably happy
that I get to be your dad.
When Mom left,
I was really scared.
I was really,
really scared. I...
I was scared you weren't
gonna be okay.
And then you started
to get older.
And you got...
I don't know.
You took your first steps,
and you said
your firsts words,
and you made
your first friend.
All the things I thought I was
going to have to teach you.
How to be nice,
how to share, how to
care about
other people's feelings.
You just started doing that
on your own.
You know, your teachers
would always say to me,
"You've got
such a lovely daughter.
"You've done
such a great job with her."
But I didn't do anything.
I really didn't.
I really didn't. I just
watched you.
And the more I watched you,
the less scared I got.
Does that make sense?
I stopped being scared
about whether you were
going to be okay
a long time ago.
Do you know why?
Because of you.
You make me brave.
And if you could just see
yourself how I see you,
which is how you are...
How you really are,
how you always have been,
I swear to God,
you wouldn't be scared either.
Friends,
family, and loved ones.
Today is a celebration.
A chance for us to applaud
the achievements
of these amazing kids,
Miles Grove Middle School's
Class of 2017.
Soon, these kids will embark
on the next chapter
of their lives.
Everybody, please...
Guys, guys, guys, come on,
please.
Just a few minutes.
Okay, please.
Please, thank you.
Hey.
I wrote you that letter
thanking you for inviting me
to your birthday party,
and you didn't write back
or anything!
I didn't even get a DM on,
like, Instagram or whatever.
And you know what?
You're always mean to me,
and I'm always nice to you,
and being mean isn't nice.
And when somebody does
something nice to you,
you're supposed
to be nice back,
and you're always mean
to me, and I know...
I'm a good person because
I'm always nice to you,
and you're just...
And, also, that card game
I got you
is, like, a really fun version
of Go Fish or whatever,
and you'd actually know
if you played it
instead of trying
to be cool all the time.
It's, like, dumb, or whatever,
but you know...
It's dumb in a way that's fun
to play
when it's raining outside,
and you'd know that
if you stopped
trying to be cool
all the time!
And...
Welcome.
Wow.
Thank you.
Would you like to, uh,
take a seat?
Oh. Uh, sure.
Cool.
You, uh, you like
chicken nuggets, right?
- Yeah.
- Okay. Cool.
I got a 20-piece, and I also
got two of
every kind of sauce.
But, you know, if you have
a favorite sauce, and you want
more than one packet of it,
you can have mine.
I like all the sauces equally.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Oh, and the nuggets have been
sitting out for a little bit
because, you know, I didn't
know when you'd be here,
so just, uh, tell me
if they're too cold,
and I can heat them up
in the microwave, okay?
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Oh. Whoops. Sorry,
must have left this out
by accident. Sorry.
I'm so stupid.
Uh, no problem.
You want to see it?
No, wait. No, it's stupid.
Sure.
Okay. Yeah.
Cool.
What is it?
Oh, well, I go to archery camp
every summer. And last summer,
I got five bull's-eyes
in a day, so, you know,
they gave me the Sharpshooter
of the Week Award.
That's actually really cool.
Yeah, not really.
It's... It's stupid.
Um...
I think it's
really cool, but...
- Yeah.
- Well, I think it's stupid.
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
To our, uh, first
friend hangout, I guess.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oops.
Do you believe in God?
Um...
Yes.
Okay. Cool.
Um...
You like the silverware?
- Yeah. It's really cool.
- Yeah. It's, uh, a lightsaber.
Check it out.
I've, uh... I've seen
some of your videos.
- Oh, those are really dumb.
- No, no, no, no, no.
They're actually really cool.
I love those videos. Um...
You're really... You're really
smart about stuff.
Like, you know
a lot of things.
Thanks.
I was thinking you should,
maybe you can...
Maybe have, like, your own
talk show or something.
Yeah.
Am I being
weird at all to you?
- Like, uh...
- No, no, no.
- Okay. Good. I'm just nervous.
- You're fine.
No, no, no. It's fine. Um...
- I am, too. Yeah.
- Yeah.
Um...
Am I being, like, quiet?
- Or too, like...
- No way.
Okay, am I, like,
talking enough?
You've been pretty talkative,
but not in an annoying way.
Just, uh... Just responding
to me, you know.
Thanks. Yeah.
This is a...
This is a good conversation,
don't you think?
Yeah. We're doing
some good talking.
Yeah. It's a nice chat.
Yep.
You know what would go
great with this?
- Hmm?
- Some Szechuan sauce!
- You like Rick and Morty, too?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.
- Nice.
- Yes!
Yes, Morty.
The Szechuan sauce!
We gotta...
We gotta get it, Morty.
Come on, Morty, come on!
Oh, jeez, Rick.
- Shut up. Morty, yes!
- Rick, I don't know!
- That's so cool.
- Yes, Morty. Keep...
Keep doing the voice, Morty.
Yes, of course.
- That show's amazing.
- Yeah.
Hmm.
You are awesome.
Thanks.
No problem.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You have fun?
Yeah. Yeah,
it was a lot of fun.
Good.
Hey, Kayla.
Um... It's you,
from eighth grade.
Congrats on finishing
high school.
I'm so proud of you.
And it's crazy to think
that, like, you're almost 18.
Um... And I bet you probably
look a lot different than me,
which is cool.
Or, if you don't,
and you look,
you know, mostly the same,
that's cool too.
How did you do on the SATs?
I mean, hopefully good.
But if not, you know,
school sucks.
Especially math. Um...
Uh, what else?
Um, do you have a boyfriend?
It's cool if you don't,
but if you do,
he should be treating you well
because you deserve it.
Is Dad still a dork?
Because, if he's not,
he's probably just someone
pretending to be Dad.
- Smell it. Smell it.
- Dad, stop. Dad... Dad...
And I really hope that
you're not too sad
about, like,
leaving all your friends
for college,
but you can still stay
in contact with them.
And if you don't, that's fine.
Because you'll make
new friends
at college anyway,
so it's, like, whatever.
And I know, like, you probably
don't want any advice
from some dumb eighth-grader
or whatever,
but if high school
sucked for you,
I'm really sorry about that.
And that, you know,
that sucks.
But I mean, it's whatever.
Middle school wasn't so great
for me, but I'm past it now.
And I'm moving forward,
and you can do that too
with high school
if it didn't go great.
Just because things are
happening to you right now
doesn't mean that they're
always gonna happen to you.
And things will change. And...
You know, you never know
what's gonna, like,
happen next,
and that's what makes things
exciting and scary.
And fun.
Yeah, okay. So, stay cool,
and I can't wait to be you.
Love, Kayla.
Gucci!
