Look out!
Are you nuts or something?
What's the matter with you?
Can't you see this truck?
Come back here!
Makes no sense.
No sense at all, Ben.
I mean, that cabby Ran him down -
Just like that.
Moore had time to get
one shot off.
- Moore?
- Don Moore.
Did you notify the chaplain,
Chief's officer?
Yes, sir.
D.A.?
Let's look at that cab.
Apparently, the cabdriver panicked
after he rammed that rig.
Maybe.
It still isn't much of a reason
for Moore to be dead.
I want lots of coverage on this, dave.
That gun certainly knocks out
the panic theory.
Possibly used that gun on Moore
If the cab hadn't been a handier weapon.
Sure looks that way, Ben.
Why?
Fred!
That's too bad about Moore.
We heard most of it While we were rolling.
Anything to add?
Well, nothing from the truck driver.
The other witness is Philip Dressler...
with the San Francisco Opera company.
Just got in on the Ansonia.
Dressler says a porter
at pier 41 took his bag,
Threw it in this cab,
Porter disappeared,
and the cab dug out fast.
Witnesses corroborated The story.
That Dressler's bag?
Yeah.
We'll book it for evidence.
Run it through the lab for prints.
This Dressler seems pretty reputable.
You don't think his bag
means anything, do you?
I don't know what to think.
The whole case doesn't add up.
What about this cabdriver,
Fred?
You make him?
No. No I.D., wallet,
nothing.
Call the cab company
and get a rundown on the cab.
It's possibly hot.
and run that gun, too.
When the coroner arrives,
Tell him we want a set of his prints
As soon as we can get them.
Run them through the bureau.
Can't identify them,
We'll get an FBI make on them.
I see this cab coming at me
like suicide's back in style.
Are you Mr. Dressler?
Yes, that's right.
I'm Lieutenant Guthrie.
This is Inspector Quine.
How do you do, gentlemen?
It's unfortunate We have to meet
Under these awful circumstances.
We meet a lot of people under
unpleasant circumstances,
Mr. Dressler.
I understand that that bag
in that cab belongs to you.
That's correct, sir.
Mind describing the contents for us?
Not at all.
There's nothing of value in the bag -
Some personal things
and a few knickknacks
I picked up in hong kong.
What kind of knickknacks?
Oh, a few ebony pieces
and a rather unusual statuette.
I - I think that's about it.
Is the statuette very valuable?
You mean valuable enough
to have this happen?
We're looking for some kind of motive.
I - I only paid $20 for it.
Now, you told Inspector Asher
this porter took your bag,
Threw it in a taxicab,
and the cab took off
without waiting for you.
That's absolutely right,
Sir.
You know, stealing a bag
that's worth nothing, it -
Well, it seems...
Pretty senseless, doesn't it?
It would be,
except two people are dead.
Would you recognize this porter
if you saw him again?
Possibly, possibly not.
I'd - I'd be glad to try,
though.
We'd appreciate it,
Mr. Dressler.
What is your address?
3960 lake street.
Phone?
Seabright 10711.
We might be calling on you.
Well, I'll be at the Opera House
most of the afternoon.
All right, Mr. Dressler.
That'll be all for now,
Thanks.
What about my bag?
We'll have to hold it for a while.
The crime lab will want to go over it
for fingerprints and so on.
Yes, of course.
Well, good day, gentlemen.
Why, ben?
No rhyme, no reason.
Yet Don Moore is dead.
The gun's as dead as your cabdriver, fellas.
I'm sorry.
We can usually bring
the serial number right out
No matter how well it's been filed down.
But in this case,
It's been completely Gouged out -
Probably by a gunsmith.
Somebody sure wanted to
guarantee it couldn't be traced.
Oh, it's a pro's gun,
All right.
Lab, Thompson speaking.
Yeah, yeah.
He's right here.
Ben.
Guthrie.
Oh, you did fine.
Who?
What does his rap sheet show?
Well, try and confirm his last address
and let us know, will you?
All right, thanks.
The B.F.I. Made the cabdriver.
Coroner got the prints right over there.
His name is James Sanford Jenkins,
Nickname Leftie.
What are his priors?
Well, his rap sheet shows
his last big fall was at 'q'.
Did five years on a 211 robbery,
drove the getaway car
on a Sausalito bank job.
Supposed to be one of the best wheelmen
in the coast.
Maybe we're getting somewhere.
Norm, did you get any prints
off Dressler's bag?
Yeah, we lifted a good, clear set,
But they don't match up
with anything we have here.
Well, maybe they will later
when we get the FBI make.
She shows up hollow under the lights,
but there's something inside.
I'm sure it's heroin.
Give it the Marquis Reagent test.
All right.
If that's the pure stuff,
There's enough in there to fix
every addict in San Francisco
for the next two weeks.
After it's cut,
it'll be worth $100,000.
What was it Dressler said?
Just a few knickknacks?
We'll get him in here fast.
No, Al, we'll go and talk to him
at the Opera House.
Oh, well,
How will we handle it?
We'll soft-pedal it.
We won't tip.
Thompson, I want a dummy package
of milk sugar
in that same wrapping.
Put the statuette together
exactly the way it was.
The plan is we let Dressler
make the delivery
If he's guilty.
Well, obviously, this is a big
narcotics-smuggling operation.
There's more Than one man responsible...
for Don Moore's death.
But I wanna get them all.
Where can we find Mr. Dressler, please?
In his office down the corridor there -
Second door to your right.
There was sure a slew of stuff
in here to mark and photograph.
We might need a record of it for evidence.
Yeah, but suppose
Dressler spots our marks
on these items?
That'll throw the whole plan
out the window, won't it?
I don't think so.
If our friend Dressler
can spot police identification marks,
at least we'll know one thing.
What's that?
He's guilty.
Yes?
Oh, I didn't expect to see you
so soon.
I see you brought my bag.
Thank you very much.
Yes, we want to talk to you
about the porter that took it.
Do you think You could identify him?
I don't know. Possibly.
We'd appreciate if you'd come
down to the Hall of Justice,
tomorrow morning at 9:00 and
take a look at the porters
who work the Ansonia dock
in the lineup.
You might be able to recognize
the man who took the bag
and threw it in the cab.
Yes, I'd be glad to.
There's one thing more,
Mr. Dressler.
We'll have to check the contents
of the bag with you.
We'd like to be sure nothing's
missing before we release it.
Well, of course, of course.
Oh, do you mind?
I think over on the table,
We'll have a little more room.
You know,
I still don't know why anyone
would want to steal this bag.
Yes, everything Seems to be here,
all right.
Here's an interesting item.
Yes, I found that
in a curio shop in hong kong.
Beautiful carving, isn't it?
You know, it's amazing the buys
you can still find.
But you do have to know
your merchandise.
I can well imagine.
Now, here's a case in point.
The day I was leaving Hong Kong,
An oriental came to my room with this.
Said one of the local antique merchants
Thought I might be interested.
Well, when he told me the price,
I was.
How much did you say you paid
for that again?
$20. Can you imagine?
Must be 400 or 500 years old.
Certainly sounds like a great buy.
What would you say it's worth here?
Well, if I were interested
in selling it,
I'm sure I'd get a great
deal more than I paid for it.
Thanks, Mr. Dressler.
See you at the lineup
tomorrow morning.
I still think we should've
booked him on possession
and then turned him over
to customs on a smuggling rap.
Both cases seem open and shut.
If Dressler's involved with a
narcotics ring,
He's more good to us out on the street.
We can pick him up anytime.
If he's smuggling heroin,
sooner or later he's
gonna have to make contact
with his connection here.
Inspectors, operator.
Inspector Asher, please.
Fred? Ben.
We just left Dressler at the opera house.
I want a 24-hour tail on him
and his house staked out.
That's right.
And I want all the porters who
were on the ansonia dock today
Brought in tomorrow morning
for the lineup.
Well, ask them if they'll cooperate,
But I want them there.
Well, if you want us,
we'll be at Chester Mcphee's
Office at the customs house.
Ben, Al, sit down.
Hello, Chet.
Chet, the tourist police
got two men killed this morning.
One of them was a police officer
named Don Moore.
I'm sorry, Ben.
So am I, 'cause the bag
was cleared through customs.
What was the contraband?
A quarter-kilo of heroin
Concealed in an oriental statuette.
That's a lot of junk to miss,
isn't it?
I don't want to see
any of the boys get killed,
especially through someone
else's carelessness.
Look, take it easy, Ben.
Ben feels pretty badly about this, Chet.
I know, Al,
and I don't blame him.
Approximately 130 million people
are cleared through customs
nationwide every year.
My baby is the biggest port on the coast.
Come here, ben.
I want to show you something.
Now, this area is the chief
target in the country
for running in narcotics.
4.500 ships a year,
almost 400 a month,
Come into this port.
That's about 1 million people,
annually.
My men are the best in the business,
there's just not enough of them
to go around.
There are too many loopholes.
That's why now and then
we miss a big one.
Maybe we can help each other on this.
What's your rundown, Ben?
Well, the bag belonged to a man
named Dressler,
Philip Dressler.
He came on the Ansonia this morning.
Philip Dressler?
Well, he'd never risk his reputation
by being involved with narcotics.
and he certainly doesn't need money.
Oh, we've interrogated him,
of course
without tipping him.
He tells a pretty straight story.
Said he bought the statuette
from an unidentified oriental in Hong Kong.
How'd you handle it?
We replaced the heroin
with a dummy shipment,
then returned the statuette
and the bag to him.
But we have Dressler under
24-hour stakeout now.
Well, sounds like the usual MO.
You've run across it before?
Tourists, reputable travelers
Being used as innocent smugglers.
And I'd say that's
what happened to Dressler.
A shipment of heroin is planted on him.
He brings the stuff in through customs,
Doesn't suspect a thing.
Once past us,
his bags get stolen.
It's just that simple.
How can a handful of agents
Check out every single tourist
That goes through?
Precisely.
Oh, sure, we get tips from overseas
About narcotic shipments,
and we nab them just
As soon as they hit port.
And we know Who the regular runners are
and which seamen are suspect.
But where do you look
If every tourist who comes in
Is a potential runner?
This man's first long fall Was in '46.
He did 31/2 in 'q' on a 211.
in '50, he was back in,
same conviction.
Now he's finally hit bottom.
All right, get out,
all of you.
You all know about officer Don Moore
Being deliberately run
Down and killed yesterday
By a cabdriver known as Leftie Jenkins.
Now, we hope this lineup
Will show up the porter
who worked with Jenkins.
Mr. Philip Dressler,
who saw the porter,
is sitting in with us this morning,
while we run through the 31 porters
who work for the Ansonia Steamship lines.
All right.
Bring on the line.
Right up the stairs.
Move a little farther down,
Please.
That's it.
Now spread out.
We thank you gentlemen
for your cooperation.
We know it isn't pleasant to be
Standing up there
Like goldfish in a bowl.
Look, we don't mind cooperating,
But let's get it over with.
This is costing us money.
We'll get it over with
Just as fast as possible.
Now if you'll all straighten up
and face forward, please.
Now first man,
Step forward.
Now turn to your right,
Please.
Okay, step back.
Next man, forward please.
Down the stairs, please.
Would you remove your glasses,
please?
Step down, boys.
Thank you. Step back.
Next man.
Turn to your right.
That's it.
Now to the left.
Step back.
Now the last man follow,
Please.
Turn to your right.
And to your left.
Okay, step back, please.
Okay, we want to thank you
for your cooperation.
Well, that's it for today.
I'm sorry,
But I just wasn't sure.
Well, none of them came even close?
Yes and no.
You know what I mean?
Well, it's like a waiter.
You order lunch and you
Just concentrate on the menu.
No one ever remembers
What his waiter looks like.
Same thing yesterday with that porter.
I never did get a good look at him.
Well, thanks very much for coming down.
Will you see Mr. Dressler
gets home, Fred?
Finally ran down Leftie Jenkins' address
11 Kent St.
If you need me,
I'll be downstairs.
Well, Jenkins certainly
had a great spot here
for a Halloween party.
Yeah, no self-respecting
witch would bring a broom into this trap.
A fit.
Coroner's report Will probably show
tthe usual number of needle marks.
You know, if Jenkins Had a big habit,
That could account for
A wheelman with his reputation
Plowing into that rig on a routine job.
Might of needed a fix pretty bad,
Lost his control,
lost his coordination.
Only one thing bothers me,
though.
Why a well-organized
operation would hire a junkie
As a wheelman.
You know, that could be the
mistake that'll nail them, ben.
Let's prowl the rest of this
place and then get out of here.
I'm in favor of that.
Wonder where that lab man is.
He ought to be here by now.
If this mark is enough,
It'll give us one more guy
to talk to about Jenkins...
and his playmates -
His laundryman.
Any relationship between Jenkins...
and a laundryman is purely coincidental.
Al, there's a funny thing
about this calendar.
Two days are circled,
and one is yesterday.
Yesterday?
That's the day Jenkins got himself killed.
Maybe he was psychic.
What's the other?
Tomorrow.
Hey, you suppose he was
scheduled for a repeat?
You know, to pick up another
dope shipment for tomorrow?
A 901 just came over the air for
You as we were driving up, ben.
Call your office.
All right, thanks,
Maury.
Go over the whole place thoroughly,
and let me know if you come up
with anything.
Okay, we'll cover it.
Coast guard just found
A John Doe in the bay.
They're bringing the body in, now;
dressed in a porter's uniform.
He's one of the porters we saw
in the lineup, all right.
Sure bet he's been murdered.
They're eliminating each other,
All right.
But for every one You get rid of,
There's two more ready and waiting.
Fasten your seatbelts,
please.
Would you mind extinguishing
Your cigarette?
We're coming in now, sir.
In case...
Julian, you take this whole
business about the subjunctive.
I don't know.
All right, dancer.
What's so difficult about the subjunctive?
Well, you take this,
for instance.
If I was you, you know?
That's all wrong.
it says here,
'if I were you.'
How far can you go with this
special stuff?
It sets you up, dancer.
It sets you up.
Remember that.
How many characters you know
Hang around street corners
Can say, 'if I were you'?
If I were you.
Yeah, yeah, I see.
It's gonna be a good day, real good one.
I can feel it.
It's gonna be a tight one,
Julian.
That's what it's gonna be.
In and out.
No, dancer.
It's going to be a good one.
Look, are you dancer?
Who are you?
I'm Mclain, you know, Sandy Mclain?
I don't know any Mclain.
Look, you see,
Jenkins got himself killed.
So?
So he's out.
I'm in.
It's just as simple as that.
Look, I brought the car along.
Would you like To take a look at it?
What car?
The car we're gonna use.
How do you like it?
How does he like what?
The car.
He says Mclain.
What do you want?
I'm your wheelman.
Yeah, I'm gonna drive you,
You know, on the job?
Why we're here to see the sites.
What sites?
What's the matter?
You think I'm a cop or something?
Why don't you call our people?
Yeah, yeah.
I'll call Chicago.
Now, wait a minute.
I was told you guys were from Miami.
Yeah, you know, I could believe
it with them tans.
You got a lucky sense
of geography, my friend.
Maybe.
Why don't you give us a name?
Lasky?
Lasky sent you.
I don't like the car.
I like my wheels stored in a
prepared drop.
I like them kept undercover till I'm ready.
I want my plates snatched
Not more than one hour
Before I move.
Return it. It's too new.
Look, you don't get it.
You see, I rented this car with
A fake set of credit cards,
A phony driver's license.
And I fixed it up all by myself.
So nobody's gonna catch us.
because she's so souped up,
nobody can catch us.
Maybe the clerk will remember you.
Nah, chance in a thousand.
That's one chance too many.
It's your mug in the lineup,
Not ours, if you get caught.
We got a cool car for a change.
I'd like to meet our employer -
This spread, all rented.
No check-in, no luggage,
No bellhops remembering
How much you tipped them.
That's sharp.
I got your money.
You gonna count it?
Dancer never counts.
Nobody every gave us a short count yet.
Well, it could be the porter
Who stole my bag.
Are you sure?
Well, I hate to say yes
and then find
that the man who was responsible
was still at large.
Would it help your memory at all
to know if the fingerprints
We found on your grip
matched the fingerprints
of that man in there?
Do they?
They do.
Well, then,
I guess that's it.
Yes, he does look like the man at that.
Who was he, ben?
Name's blinky simms -
Has a long record with the FBI.
How was he killed?
Someone gave him a shot That was hot.
Blinky was on heroin.
He was probably promised
a fix for stealing your bag.
Instead, he got a hotshot -
A deadly poison injected
Directly into the bloodstream.
Well, thanks very much
for coming down, Mr. Dressler.
This has all been
Quite upsetting, gentlemen.
But if you need me for anything else,
Please call me.
I don't like Mr. Philip Dressler.
He's too smooth.
Well, like him or not,
He's clean as a plaster saint
As far as we're concerned Right now.
How does it feel to make
Five g's in one day?
Dancer derives No particular feeling
from it.
Oh, no, not much.
I've been watching you, Mclain.
You've been coming on too big.
I don't like that.
Please, we prefer as little
conversation as possible
from outsiders.
Dancer works better that way.
You didn't know before.
Now you do.
Where do we meet this guy?
Pacific dock straight ahead.
How do we know that's him?
He's wearing horn-rimmed
Glasses, ain't he?
He's wearing a trench coat,
Ain't he...
with the collar turned down?
Now, it's got to be him,
Because who wears a trench coat
with the collar turned down?
That's staples, huh?
I knew a guy like him once.
No, you didn't.
There's never been A guy like dancer.
He's a wonderful, pure,
Pathological study -
A psychopath with no inhibitions.
Lasky sent me.
Well, right on time.
I'm always on time.
They're due to get off The boat pretty soon.
I'll point out The marks to you.
You see,
Dancer is an addict -
An addict with a real big habit.
'h' like in "heroin".
'h' like in "Hate".
Well, I tell you,
He don't chill me none.
It's bad enough dancer's got
a rough job.
We have to be saddled with a cripple, too?
Listen, dipso,
if I ever see you with a bottle,
If I even smell it...
Look, I drive better with it,
you know?
I think better, too.
It's just like a medicine for my mind.
Your prescription's just been canceled.
Two of the three parties
We want are passengers.
The other one's in the crew.
So?
The man told me to deliver it to you.
What you pick up,
You put in it.
How do I make the pass?
At 4:00 today,
You're at sutro's museum.
You're at the maritime exhibit.
You got that pouch.
You see a ship's binnacle
at the end of the room.
It's got a sliding panel Behind it.
You slide it open,
Put that pouch inside.
You close it.
You do this so nobody sees you.
That's all.
You got a time spread,
But you got to be out of sutro's
No later than five after four.
Want me to repeat?
Pouch will be picked up at five
after four?
All I know is you got to be out
of that place by then.
You're repeating yourself.
Pretty neat operation,
Huh?
But then it figures.
The man's a very neat type.
Here they come.
There.
The tall man...
The lady in a white hat.
The name is sanders.
They live at 9020 jackson -
Private residence.
Sanders.
9020 jackson.
Better write it down.
I said, hadn't you Better write it down?
I never write anything down.
I hope you know what -
They got two in help -
An oriental houseboy
and a maid named elsie.
Elsie wears a hearing aid.
The stuff is packed in
The handles of a set of ivory...
and silver flatware
They bought in bangkok.
The lady and the kid -
Dorothy Bradshaw and her daughter, cindy.
Is she a carrier?
Those are the breaks.
Our Tokyo connection Fingered her.
She bought a doll for the kid.
The stuff's in the doll -
1/8th of a kilo of the purest.
Like the rest, she's a carrier
and doesn't know it.
How can you finger these people?
You've never seen them before.
I saw their photographs.
They were airmailed
to me from Hong Kong.
No chance of a mistake?
The man don't make mistakes.
So she's a carrier.
That's too bad, lady.
She's stopping at the mark hopkins.
The last one's still aboard.
We can see him from over there.
He's one of the crew.
That's Warner coming down
on that thing.
He's carrying a shipment
in the Tang dynasty horse.
All you got to do is ask him for it.
He was told to deliver
it himself to a Mr. Evans.
You're Evans.
Just comes breezing in with a
package of stuff under his arm?
A clean-cut kid like that?
You think customs has got enough
men to frisk everybody 100%?
Plus, he doesn't know it's in the horse.
He's strictly a pigeon.
One of the man's Hong Kong
Suppliers set him up.
Where do I make my meet with him?
He was told a Mr. Evans Would contact him...
at the Seaman's club.
Well, my job is done.
Evans.
You mind If I ask you something?
Ask.
Ah, never mind.
No offense, you understand.
I was just gonna ask,
What makes a guy like you tick?
I had an old man once.
Well, most people do.
I never met mine.
I'll see you around,
Finger.
Pass is at 4:00.
What's that?
The siren on top of the ferry building.
Blows three times a day Just like now...
8:00 in the morning,
12:00 noon, 4:30.
Like I told you, Julian.
This is gonna be a tough one...
in and out.
I say it's going to be a smooth one.
The pass is at 4:00.
When the siren blows at 4:30,
We'll be all finished, so relax.
Now, what's your procedure?
I wanna look the ground over.
2090 jackson, the mark hopkins,
and the seaman's club...
in that order.
Hi. Just got off a ship.
I'm filthy.
I'd like a steam.
You'll find some towels
Down by the steam room.
All right, thanks.
Will you tell the operator
I'm expecting a call
From a Mr. Evans?
Larry Warner's the name.
Sure, Mr. Warner.
Thanks.
Mr. Evans calling Larry Warner.
I'll come by.
Mr. Warner?
Warner? Here.
I'm Evans.
How about a steam?
What?
How about a steam?
Got the room all to myself.
Sure, why not?
Steam.
Don't stay in too long.
It opens the pores.
That's a yock.
Yock?
Okay, okay.
That's amusing.
Better. Much better.
Yock's a crude word.
I'll hang up your things.
Hey, you like it thick,
Don't you?
Who likes it thin?
I don't like it when I can't see
who I'm talking to.
Whom.
My friend in Hong Kong
said you were top collector
of Tang Dynasty in this country.
He ought to know.
Shows you What a small world this is.
Well, I always liked Chinese art,
So I'm standing in front of
this store window in Hong Kong,
and the guy who owns
the store said, 'come on in.'
We hit it off.
He put me up at his house,
Fed me, got me on a ship's crew.
He asked me to bring it in for you
Said it was very rare.
He was afraid It would get chipped
If he sent it by freight.
I took good care of it,
Mr. Evans...
real good care.
You got it here?
Yeah, upstairs.
If you've had enough steam,
We'll go upstairs and get it now.
You stay here and take some more steam.
I'll run up and get the horse.
What's your room number?
Oh, that's okay.
I wanna come along.
I'm right upstairs, 604.
You just tell me Where the key is,
and I'll...
There are no keys here.
This is the seaman's club.
People trust each other,
like you.
You trust me, don't you?
Or do you?
You think I was born yesterday?
You're no more a collector
of antiques than I am.
I found out what's really inside
that horse.
You took a chance smuggling that
stuff into the country, kid.
Yeah, yeah.
Never broke the law in my life.
Nobody'd every figure me
to do anything wrong.
So what's now?
So, I'm broke, that's all, just b-r-o-k-e.
But if you give me...
say, $1,000?
We could forget I know anything.
You think That'll about cover it?
Why be greedy?
Oh, repairman's in there,
Boys.
Be about five minutes.
Let's go for a swim.
Two kids tried to get in.
They got a good look at me.
We're gonna leave separately.
Okay - room 604.
It's unlocked.
Get the junk out of the horse While I dress.
In the car in three minutes,
Ok.
Did he say anything for me?
He said,
'why be greedy?'
Those were his last words.
'Why be greedy?'
That'll print well for an epitaph.
Okay, okay.
Stop drooling.
Get going, Julian.
Yeah.
Let me have another one From this angle.
Any closer?
Well, how soon can I get
the autopsy report?
Today sometime.
Oh, that's a help.
Don't commit yourself.
Ben, you've known me for 15 years.
You know you don't Have to push me.
Well, I want to get that slug
as soon as possible...
to run a ballistics Make on it.
No.
You through with him?
Yeah.
Ben?
Nobody heard a shot,
including a half dozen kids
That have been hanging around
The locker room all morning.
Could've been a silencer.
All right, boys.
Would you mind giving us A rundown...
on the story again, please?
There's not much to run.
Warner came in for a steam,
Said he was expecting a call
from a guy named, uh, Evans,
So I relayed it to the switchboard.
What time did warner Get here?
It's marked right here.
Yeah, signed in at 11:05.
Well, was anyone around here
asking for warner this morning,
either before or after 11:00?
Nobody I saw, and I've
been on duty since 8:00.
But then anyone can get past me
when I'm away from the desk.
Well, is there anything else You can tell us?
No, that's it.
Thanks. Get his name and address, Fred.
Sure.
A guy really got killed in there, huh?
Shot?
He sure did.
Having himself a steam.
Boom - just like that.
What time did you boys
get here this morning?
Oh, around 11:15.
The guy says it'll be About 5 minutes
Before we can get in The steam room.
The attendant?
No, some other guy.
He was standing by the steam
room door, keeping us out,
So we went and took a swim.
What did he look like?
I'd say he was about 5'9',
5'10', 160 maybe,
Wouldn't you?
Yeah, and he was wearing A dark gray suit.
and he had a tan - A real good tan.
He was pretty old, too.
50, maybe.
Oh, and he has A mustache.
Got that, Fred?
Yeah, I'll get it Right on the air.
We better go to the desk...
and have them send someone up to
Warner's room to go in with us.
You stick around,
Fellas.
I want you to look at some mug shots.
Apparently, the hood on
Lookout had a triggerman
Who was his partner in the job.
It's funny no one saw The other guy.
You didn't need me here.
These rooms are never locked.
They will be now
Until the coroner Gets through with it.
We'll have an officer Stand by.
Ben... Customs report.
the victim docked today
on the pacific princess.
Only one declared item -
An antique tang dynasty horse.
No stated value.
It looks like warner Was quite a traveler.
And nothing like the trip He just took.
It's hollowed out, just
like the Dressler statue.
If that thing Was filled with dope,
It'd be worth A million bucks.
That's why warner Was killed.
Let's get the lab boys Up here.
Keep this door locked.
Yes, sir.
Now, remember - Take your time,
Just take your time...
and keep it impersonal,
do you understand?
Okay, okay.
By 4:30,
We'll be finished.
You sound like a coach Between halves.
Just drive the car,
Dipso.
Didn't mean nothing.
Would you mind if I were
to buy just a little jug -
Just take a belt once in a while?
I don't want to get A heat on, I just -
No.
Did he have to...
kill that kid?
When you live outside the law,
You have to eliminate Dishonesty.
That kid made a deal,
then tried to shake us down.
That's fundamentally dishonest,
so he had to die.
Besides, a dead man Can't point at you.
Your buddy gives me the creeps.
Does he think he's the only
expert around here or something?
If he continues to listen
to me, he'll be the best.
Yes?
I'm Evans,
from the ship -
The one Mr. aMrs. Sanders Just -
Oh, they are resting,
Mr. Evans.
Would you like to leave your card?
No, it's all right.
I'd just as soon not get
them involved in this anyway.
Some mix-up down at the dock.
Something about a set of flatware
The sanders brought in.
Oh, yes.
Please come in.
This way, please.
In the dining room, sir.
We started to put it away.
I'm glad you didn't ut it away yet.
I may have to take this
set back for an hour or two.
Take it back?
Someone else brought in
a set exactly like this,
and they're claiming This is their set,
While the one they're holding
belongs to the sanders.
I don't understand, sir.
You know, like, sometimes
they get babies mixed up...
in a hospital.
Mr. Sanders is A very precise person.
I don't see how.
Well, the shipping cartons Are exactly alike.
Maybe they got them mixed up
down at the docks.
Maybe they didn't.
That's what we've got to find out.
It's a routine matter.
I'll take this stuff back...
and let the people satisfy themselves.
Then I'll bring the right set back to you.
But I couldn't let you do that, sir.
No?
I must first ask Mr. Sanders.
But you said He was resting.
You come back in 2 hours.
No, I can't.
Those people are waiting.
You come back...
Please!
Put those back there.
You go now.
I'll ask Mr. Sanders When he wakes up.
Put them back.
Mr. Sanders!
The last thing he said Was, 'Mr. Sanders!'
Oh, I like that.
It demonstrates his servility,
His need for help,
his dependence.
It's very interesting.
Oh, ben...
Here are the reports...
on the airline hostess We interviewed.
Anything?
Most of the ones that came in...
on the long, nonstop flights are off duty.
We've only located 5 Out of 18.
You run down Anything else...
on that cab Jenkins was driving?
I'm afraid not.
It was stolen yesterday morning in Oakland,
While the cabbie Was having coffee.
If Dressler's stakeout
comes up with anything...
It could be he's clean.
Better keep a tail on him
for his own protection.
Right.
for his own protection?
Well, that was a sizable shipment of heroin.
Those gunmen don't know we spotted it.
They might write it off,
Or they might pay a call on Dressler.
You know,
somewhere out there
Are a couple of hired gunmen
in town to do a job.
Maybe right now they're lining
up that Smith & Wesson.38...
on another target.
Are you looking for The lady in 942?
Y- yes. I, um,
I have something for her.
Well, you better leave it
at the desk or come back later,
Because she's left.
I'm a little short on time, madam.
Well, I heard her tell her little girl
That they Were going shopping...
and then to The steinhart aquarium.
The aquarium?
Yes.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
If there's any way I can cooperate -
We'll let you know,
Mr. Sanders. Thank you.
The second killing involving someone...
who was aboard The pacific princess.
Yeah, and there will be more.
There were more narcotics
brought in than souvenirs.
Do you know any way to run down
a whole boatload of people...
and warn them in time?
About all we can do now
Is put out a supplement to our broadcast,
Notify all stations to be on the lookout...
for a teakwood chest
containing oriental flatware,
Possibly in the possession of
the man previously described.
There's not much to go on.
Something will turn up There.
It better before someone else gets killed.
2 hours and a half to go.
I told you this was
going to be a smooth one.
A smooth one?
That girl's not going to be
as easy as the other two.
Why not?
All we have to do
is get her back to the hotel.
Yeah, that's right.
That's all we got do -
get her back to the hotel.
Pardon me, Miss.
weren't you on The pacific princess?
Why, yes, I was.
Just now I remember.
My friend and I - We saw you onboard.
We got on at Honolulu.
We even made a bet About you -
Wondered if the little girl
was your kid sister
Or your daughter.
And how did you bet?
Neither side.
I said you were the daughter
and she was really your mother.
That's cindy, my daughter.
My name is tom Evans, and that's
my associate over there.
His name is tom, also.
I hope you forgive us
for breaking in like this.
We were just kind of taking
in the sights, you know?
Oh, he's okay.
Is there just the two of you?
Yes.
Something's disturbing you.
Why do you say that?
I could see it in your eyes.
They're almost sad.
You're very discerning.
Well, you haven't got
a monopoly on sadness.
Besides, why else would a lady like you
Be traveling alone with a daughter?
Nobody likes to travel alone.
No.
Nobody likes it.
Now you sound bitter.
that's something I thought
I had a corner on.
I guess I was hoping
San francisco would be an answer
That he'd be here after all,
at least if not for me,
for our little girl, for Cindy.
But he didn't show up,
did he?
I mean, you are alone,
aren't you?
There wasn't even a message
from him at the hotel.
That's too bad.
Here, I'm not making a
very good impression on you.
Let me take these packages.
No. Thank you,
though, Mr. Evans.
I didn't mean to -
I know you didn't.
I don't want you to get the idea
That I was, well, um, trying
to pick you up or something.
Weren't you?
I guess I was, at that.
Maybe I'm lonely, too.
A fella like me gets that way sometimes,
Even in a crowd - All alone and lonely.
That's - that's easy to sell yourself
That the world is black,
Mr. Evans.
I suppose they call it Negative selling.
I'm not a very good Salesman.
I was trying to do a job
of positive selling with you.
And what are you selling?
Free transportation Back to the hotel...
for you, the little girl,
and all these packages.
We've got a car outside.
frankly, I am tired.
Mr. Evans, you just made a sale.
Good. Let me introduce you
to my associate.
Cindy...
This is my friend Tom gibbs.
We're going to drive back to
the hotel with Mr. Evans.
Got a new car.
This is richards.
Well, here I go again.
This time I have 2 characters
with heavy tans.
One of them fits the make we Have on air.
The other's dark,
medium build. Uh-huh.
They headed out of here in
a '57 gray plymouth sedan -
License mth889.
The guy driving Has medium complexion,
Blond hair, bow tie, and no hat.
The other men are wearing gray hats.
There were also a woman, about
30, and a child in the car.
Right.
I'll give you the packages now.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
You've been so kind.
Won't you stay a moment?
Yes, thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'll put these in the
other room and freshen up.
Cindy, you entertain the gentlemen.
Yes, mommy.
Some doll, huh?
Mommy got it for me in Tokyo.
You get any other dolls in Tokyo?
No, that's all.
Pretty, isn't she?
She's beautiful.
That's silk - Pure silk.
Do you know how they make silk?
No. Suppose you tell us.
Silkworms - they make
their beds and sleep.
When they wake up,
that's silk.
Do you mean to say that worms made this?
The doll.
Do you mind if I take it out?
Oh, of course not.
I had her out lots of times on the boat.
Go on.
Examine it.
See what holds it together.
See, she has all these petticoats.
Only in Japan, you don't
call them petticoats.
Mommy knows what they
call them, but I forgot.
Now, this sticker - is
that what holds it together?
Does it go all the way up?
Yes.
It isn't here.
It's gotta be.
You're hurting her!
Mr. Evans!
My doll!
Put that down this second
and get out of here.
What is this?
Where is it?
You found it,
didn't you?
Please - please Leave us alone.
We'll forget about The doll.
Just leave us alone.
That tired line You fed me -
Thought I bought it,
Huh?
Think I'm a patsy?
Try to come on big with me, huh?!
No!
Listen, kid - Now, you listen good.
You ever see a package inside that doll?
You tell me where your mother put it...
and I'll let her go, okay?
You saw it?
I put it on my dolly's face.
If you want your mother to live,
You tell me where It is.
I'm telling you -
There was a bag of powder
under my dolly's dress.
Yeah?
Where is it now?
I used it on the boat.
You used it?
to powder my dolly's face.
Kid, nobody ever used
A more expensive dusting powder.
Mr. Evans...
Think, Mr. Evans.
If you do what you have
in mind, then what follows?
They crossed us.
What else is there to do?
Us, Mr. Evans - You and me.
If you do this,
You'll put us right in the dead-letter drop.
Remember the man - he'll
want an accounting.
He'll want to ask questions
about the missing stuff.
But we'll tell him.
Maybe he won't believe us.
It's worth a fortune.
Maybe he'll think we
tried to cut ourselves in...
on part of the action.
Yeah.
Yeah, I see.
but not if they tell him.
Then we're clear. We're free.
We can sleep nights.
We can walk down dark streets.
We can stand on busy
intersections at high noon.
Now, you had to do what you did...
to Warner and to the houseboy -
I have to kill them, too.
No.
What do you mean, 'no'?
Not if the lady's wise enough...
to follow our instructions explicitly,
Not if she's wise enough to walk
quietly out of this room,
into the elevator,
and down through the lobby.
Are you that wise?
I hope so,
for the sake of you both.
I'll do whatever you say.
I'm personally very pleased
with your decision.
Because in my profession,
there's one thing I dislike,
and it's hearing someone's Last words.
You know,
famous last words.
Be firm with him,
you understand?
What happened wasn't our fault.
We performed on the contract.
You worry too much.
I'm fine. The man don't scare me.
I'll bring him back here,
You tell him what happened to the stuff.
Another thing - Be careful.
You think I can't take him or something?
Sure, you can take him.
It's what he represents that you can't take -
Not even you.
They'd catch up with us
someday, someplace.
Keep thinking of that.
Play it easy.
Remember - at 4:30, we'll
be all finished and gone.
Step right this way -
Sutro's museum and ice-skating rink,
The most fabulous showplace
West of the Rockies.
License - 'm' - Mary, 't' - Tom,
'h' - Henry, 889.
A gray '57 Plymouth sedan
Parked in front of Sutro's museum.
Occupants - two males,
one woman, and one child -...
and fitting the description.
Keep under surveillance,
But make no attempt to
apprehend the occupants.
They are armed and dangerous.
We're sending help.
Kma438.
Attention, all cars,
Vicinity sutro's museum,
Richmond three-wheeler now
has can under surveillance.
Richmond 2 and 4, respond.
All motorcycle officers in vicinity, respond.
Inspectors 32, respond.
All units, rendezvous with Inspectors 32,
Who will be in charge.
No sirens.
Inspectors 32- We're rolling.
What happens when he
Brings this man back?
What happens afterwards?
What kind of men are you?
See, you cry.
That's why women
have no place in society.
Women are weak.
Crime's aggressive,
and so is the law.
Ordinary people of your class -
You don't understand a
criminal's need for violence.
You're sick.
Yeah, but I wish your buddy
would hurry up.
Mister...
Can you fix it?
It's busted.
What's busted?
This.
Now look.
If you turn this,
You can see the numbers.
See?
You're the man.
I'm dancer.
The warner kiddie was a push.
The stuff was right there in the horse.
Sanders - No problem, either.
The houseboy had it all laid out for me.
The Bradshaw dame and her kid -
That's where the job went to pieces.
The kid used the stuff
as dusting powder for a doll.
It's all gone.
How about that?
Crazy kid.
But Julian and I figured you'd
never stand for a short count.
I know we wouldn't.
So what else could I do but get to you?
I don't have all the stuff,
but the rest of it's here.
Here.
Listen, I just want to get Julian and me
Off the hook with you.
You talk to her.
The dame and her kid -
They're right outside.
They'll tell you how it was.
Then Julian and I will blow.
You want me to help you?
I'll be glad to -
Julian and I don't want no beef with you.
We didn't plan on that kid
Using that stuff to powder her dolly's nose.
When it got goofed up,
I couldn't drop a short shipment...
without some explanation,
Could I?
Could I?
All right, children,
time to go.
There's lots more to see.
Are you gonna say anything?
You're dead.
Come on, Janet.
Dead?
What do you mean, dead?
I told you how it was.
They're right -
That's the truth.
Nobody ever sees me.
That's gonna make you dead.
Maybe you'll make it to the airport.
Maybe you won't.
But your time is borrowed.
You're dead.
It's the first car beyond the bus.
Remember - there's
a woman and child in that car.
You better notify communications
we're here.
Yes, sir.
We got about 2 minutes
to make golden gate bridge
Before they set up roadblocks.
If you can't make it,
we'd better scatter now.
I'm your boy.
I'll get you out.
Attention all cars,

It's all right, honey.
Don't worry.
What happened?
Our fee got raised for this job.
We can peddle this stuff for a mint.
I told you how to handle it!
What went wrong?!
I came on just like You said - real easy.
I told him what happened.
I tried to sell him,
but he wouldn't buy it.
That's all.
That's all?
You put us in the
deep freeze and then you -
What else is there?!
It happened!
Maybe I should cry!
Maybe it's not too late.
Maybe I could see the man
and I could explain it.
He won't hear you.
not him?
Not after what I told you
would happen to us.
Maybe you wanna go back...
and look at what's left of him on that ice.
He pushed me too far!
Look out!
So I pushed him just far enough.
Get us out.
You got us in there,
you get us out!
They're trying to kill us!
We got 2 choices -
Either we get killed by this jerk,
Or we stop and shoot it out.
You want to stop and shoot it out, Julian?
You know I never fired
a gun in my life.
Then cool it!
From here on in,
I'm running the show - me.
You're in the back seat.
That's where you stay.
They beat us here!
The bridge is blocked!
It's okay, though.
I got a hide-out - A warehouse on fulsome.
Fugitive car speeding east
on fort scott road.
Inspectors 32 following suspect car east...
on fort scott road.
The warehouse is on the next block.
You wanna live, Mac,
you'll get us out of here and
get us out fast.
We're in luck.
There's a freeway just ahead.
The last thing the man
in the wheelchair said...
'now get out.'
Was that for the book,
Julian?
And just before that?
Say something for the book.
