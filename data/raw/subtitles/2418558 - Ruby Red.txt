This way!
They're catching up, Paul.
Go that way.
Don't let them get away!
That Way!
Hurry!
Come on, hurry up!
Gwendolyn is in safety,
Grace will protect her.
Surrender!
Never!
16 YEARS LATER
Living with my grandmother,
Lady Arista, is a real drag.
I have to deal with
nineteenth century attitudes...
...and a cousin who thinks
she's the eighth wonder of the world.
Charlotte, my dear!
Charlotte suffers from
a rare genetic defect
which allegedly
makes her very precious.
She can't be...
She can't be compared
with ordinary people.
For as long as I can remember,
they've all made a big secret of it.
My Great-Aunt Maddy reckons
that one day this gene
will allow her to "travel in time".
But Maddy's always had a weakness
for the supernatural.
A life of great responsibility
now awaits my dear granddaughter.
Many happy returns!
My mum and my brother Nick
at least try to be reasonably normal,
but in this family
that's pretty near impossible.
Put the camera away!
Gwendolyn, we're having cake!
And that's me,
known as the black sheep of the family.
You shouldn't try
to compensate for your plain looks
with that tasteless getup.
You'll never find a date
for the St Lennox's ball that way.
Great party.
They'll be dancing on the tables soon.
Silence is a virtue
that a lady of your age
should already have at her command.
Didn't I send your mother money so
she could buy you a respectable dress?
That's right,
it's your birthday tomorrow,
maybe there'll be some leftover.
It would be a shame
to throw away the leftovers.
- Gideon! How lovely!
- Lady Arista.
- Happy Birthday!
- Thank you.
Would you bring us
three glasses of champagne?
Yes... What?
Yes, why not...
How embarrassing!
Gwendolyn, really!
They all think
I'm a complete moron.
And unfortunately
I sometimes feel that I am.
Is he the one with the ponytail?
Him and Charlotte
make quite a couple, eh?
- Do you think they're an item?
- Who cares?
She can do whatever she wants
with that slimeball.
At least his suit's ruined.
- Mr Bernhard, the dress!
- Gwen!
Wicked!
Your family has more secrets
than Ml5 and MI6 put together.
This is better than any soap opera.
Great dress.
- Where are they taking Charlotte?
- To the Temple.
To the Lodge of Count Saint-Germain.
What kind of lodge? A secret lodge?
They're a bunch of
fanatical old conspirators
who think they're incredibly important.
How's he involved?
Is he a conspirator, too?
Gideon de Villiers
has a similar problem to Charlotte's.
So he's an extra special
gene carrier, too?
In the de Villiers family, the gene's
passed down the male side of the family,
in the Montrose family,
down the female side...
That's none of our business.
Fortunately, it's not our problem!
The Guardians of the Lodge
have been working towards
this moment for centuries.
Now we are about to witness
the last member
of the Circle of Blood shine.
"In present and past,
ruby red is the first
and also the last. "
Did you find out
what happened to Charlotte at the Lodge?
No one tells me anything.
- And your Aunt Maddy?
- Not a reliable source.
Last week she said
she'd read in the stars
that I'm going to be prom queen.
And this morning
she read in her tea leaves
that it would rain beans for me today.
Not again.
It tastes like
it's been on the floor anyway.
Fancy smearing my food
on your blouse, too?
No.
You're so embarrassing.
Ignore her.
I've spoken to Gordon.
He has a stepbrother who might
go to the school ball with you.
But he said you'd have to pay
for his ticket from Essex.
I'm not going to the ball anyway.
Cut out that nonsense,
you're completely mad!
You can talk, you're the one
with the genetic mutation.
It's a gift.
It's connected to your birthday,
isn't it?
Are you in pain?
Did they perform experiments on you
at the Lodge?
And that guy...
Was he there, too?
Gideon? Of course.
Gideon and I have been preparing
for our roles for years.
Together.
Well?
- Say something.
- I'm still here, as you can see.
Are you dizzy?
They said that's how it starts.
Gwendolyn,
go to your room and play.
Come and sit with me, my angel.
Entertain me for a while.
Say something, dear.
Glenda makes me terribly nervous!
You feel something, don't you?
Where's Lady Arista?
Your grandmother's making a phone call
in the next room.
Unfortunately, she's so quiet
you can't understand a word.
What if...
...Charlotte vanished into thin air
right in front of our eyes?
The de Villiers
are expecting us at the Temple.
Those de Villiers
are a bunch of arrogant show-offs.
How come everyone's so sure
Charlotte's the one
who inherited the gene?
I won't say a single word.
Your grandmother would kill me
if I said anything.
There was a special astronomical
alignment when Charlotte was born.
Mr Newton calculated
the date of her birth.
What, our milkman?
No, Isaac Newton,
the mathematician.
Sometimes it's better to be in the dark
and to stay that way.
The Lodge...
...has a time machine...
...under ground.
They call it the "chronograph".
Of course.
I've heard of it, too.
You had the last one.
Could you go down to the shop
and buy some more?
I'm just going out for some air,
and I'll get your sweets.
Don't you feel well, dear?
Help! Somebody help me!
A thief!
- Give that to me!
- I'm sorry...
Why does it stink here?
It's an outrage! She appeared
out of nowhere and tried to rob me!
- She tried to rob me!
- No, I didn't!
Is she a lunatic? She's a lunatic!
What's your business here?
Where are you from?
I live here! That's my room!
You? In that house?
You'll see what we do
with someone like you.
It was awful!
They were going to put me in jail,
or a lunatic asylum!
You went back in time!
Or I'm insane, like those people
who say they were abducted by aliens.
But what's worse: going mad
or really going back in time?
You have the gene,
not Charlotte!
It's a time travel defect,
it makes total sense.
That can't be true,
and how come I've got it?
Isaac Newton can't be wrong.
The bloke with the apple and gravity.
"Infinitesimal calculus..."
"Transcendence of all spirals,
quadratics, optics..."
"...the law of gravitation".
"Transcendence of all spirals"
sounds the most like time travel.
No, it doesn't.
Do you think
Gideon can travel in time, too?
Yeah, he'll go with you.
I can see the two of you holding hands
at Anne Boleyn's execution.
How romantic.
It's not funny, I'm scared.
Where are you?
Millennium Bridge.
Get off the bridge!
If you go back in time now,
you could end up in the Thames!
What?
You think it'll happen again?
Yes!
Go home and talk to you mum!
"The Count of Saint-Germain..."
Mum, it's...!
May all your wishes come true.
How lovely! Thanks, Mum.
It belonged to someone very special.
It'll protect you.
Lady Arista would never approve
of such revelry!
All the more reason to revel.
Can I have Charlotte's room
if they keep her at the Lodge?
What if Charlotte didn't inherit
the stupid gene?
What makes you say that?
Are you alright?
Is it a stroke?
Let her be, she's seeing a vision.
Lucy! Lucy...
The egg made of sapphire...
A raven will hatch from it...
Time is running out...
The egg will break.
No! Lucy! No!
Gwendolyn is falling! She's falling!
Watch out!
I'm here!
Promise me
you'll take care of yourself.
What did you see?
An egg made of sapphire...
...a raven, a tower clock...
...and Lucy.
She looked just like she did back then.
- Who's Lucy?
- Your cousin.
She ran away from home
when she was 17.
In love and foolish.
It caused a dreadful scandal.
Her name's been taboo here ever since.
Do you actually believe in it?
In Aunt Maddy's vision, I mean.
Sometimes I get the feeling
we have rather too much
imagination in this family.
I think we'd live happier,
more restful lives
if we stuck to believing
what normal people believe.
Grandpa?
Gwendolyn,
where did you come from?
- Nice pyjamas.
- But you died when I was six!
Yes, but that's a while away yet.
It's only 1994.
Our paths will cross quite often.
Is this the first time
you've travelled in time?
My second. Does it stop?
We haven't much time. Listen:
Each time traveller
bears the name of a gem.
You're the Ruby.
I've left you a message.
All eyes will be upon you...
We must see Lord Montrose,
immediately!
Quick, hide!
Here!
Your daughter Grace,
of all people, helped them!
The gene carriers Lucy and Paul
have stolen the chronograph
and taken it into the past.
We were afraid that might happen.
How dare these traitors
harm our cause in this way?
And why have the Montrose family
got their fingers in the pie again?
They mistrust you,
you shouldn't have lied to them.
And they've discovered that...
Here, here and there as well.
I'd hoped it wouldn't happen again.
I'm a total freak.
Right:
that's why I like you so much.
My grandfather must have known.
He wasn't surprised to see me.
And look: my cousin Lucy.
She has the gene, too.
She ran away with a Paul de Villiers.
Here they are, at the school ball.
Another de Villiers.
But he doesn't look anything like Gideon.
Do you know what Charlotte's
going to wear to the ball?
- I'll bet she's having a dress made.
- I don't give a damn.
You're not going.
Or have you got a date after all?
We're going to do research
for an article there.
That's right.
"Smug girls at school ball,
British teenagers
in a den of clich√© and desire."
I bet Charlotte
will be queen of the prom.
- I bet you're as shallow as an egg cup.
- What?
I was up all night researching.
Brilliant story, Pulitzer Prize material.
This Count Saint-Germain is either
one cool dude or a complete fraud.
He was reputed to be immortal.
He founded the Lodge in 1745.
But what does the Lodge do?
They act like
they're out to save the world.
If you ask me, people like that
want something completely different:
to rule the world,
just like in James Bond.
How do I fit into all this?
As Charlotte's no help,
you'll have to stick close to Gideon.
You'll have to spy on him,
that can't be difficult.
- Use your female charms...
- On that slimeball?
Must I?
We'll be in trouble
if we're late for class again.
Shit, not again!
Really? Now?
Hide in the toilet,
no one will see you.
What's going on here?
Was that Gwendolyn Shepherd?
- Where is she?
- Mr Whitman, hello.
Gwendolyn, here?
No, I mean yes...
- What happened?
- She ran to the toilet.
She's caught a bug:
diarrhoea, vomiting, skin rash.
- It's horrible and highly contagious...
- Don't lie to me!
Gwendolyn, wait.
- Stop, I can explain everything.
- I can't wait to hear this.
- I didn't mean it like that!
- How did you mean it then?
Calm down, this whole business
is bad enough as it is.
It'd be easier
if you didn't work against me.
We've got to get back. The Count
will be wondering where we are.
This all seems strangely familiar.
It's not like they say it is.
Question everything.
Don't let them manipulate you!
Trust in your powers!
Are you talking to yourself now?
- Or is someone there?
- No!
A spy?
There's no one there!
Thank God!
I told Mr Whitman you were puking up.
He wanted to kill me.
Something strange happened.
That I can believe.
The liver goes there.
There were two of me.
Things can't go on like this.
Call your mum right now, OK?
Here.
Unbelievable: you were necking
in the past, at a ball,
and you can't even remember
what the guy looked like?
It wasn't me,
it was my weird doppelganger.
Were your eyes open or closed?
Concentrate! Was it a first kiss
or a "we've already done it" kiss?
Come on! Hurry up and get in!
- So Aunt Maddy isn't crazy after all?
- Yes!
I'm taking you to the Lodge.
To that sect? Now? Forget it!
They're the only ones
who can control it.
Maybe I haven't got it.
Listen to me, will you?
This isn't a game, OK?
It could happen again and
you could end up anywhere,
like the Great Fire of London
in 1600 something,
and your school uniform
would burn like tinder.
Here we are.
Can I help you? Ms Montrose!
Shepherd. I married.
I need to speak to Falk de Villiers.
- They're all in a meeting.
- Tell them I've brought the Ruby.
- I beg your pardon?
- Do you think I'm kidding?
How come you know so much
about this place?
My father... your Grandfather Lucas
was Grand Master of this Lodge.
They're interested in ancient myths,
and in time travellers, like you.
How many time travellers are there?
Just 12,
and most of them are dead.
You're the last one.
Do you realize
how idiotic all this sounds?
Grace, how lovely to see you!
Thomas George.
They won't all be as pleased as you are.
It just happened. I didn't do a thing
and all of a sudden I was...
There was a carriage
and a lady in a lace bonnet.
She had apples and a cucumber
and she called me a thief...
Is that really true, Gwendolyn?
She's your Ruby.
Impossible!
Charlotte is the gene carrier.
Newton calculated
the date of her birth.
Gwendolyn was born
on the same day as Charlotte.
What?
Your dad and I bribed the midwife
to falsify the birth certificate.
Does this woman seriously expect us
to believe a word of all this?
She helped Lucy and Paul to run away!
You falsified my birth certificate?
What's that got to do with Lucy?
We always hoped that Charlotte
had inherited the gene, not you.
This is ridiculous!
Gwendolyn's pea-brained
and has two left feet!
My sister's trying to make herself
the centre of attention again.
I'd be happy to let Charlotte
remain a guinea pig
for these fanatical
esoteric pseudo-scientists.
That was totally irresponsible.
I hope you can reconcile it
with your conscience.
It's bad enough that
you chose to go off with that loser.
Still jealous Falk?
After all these years?
You still don't get it, do you?
How carelessly
you placed your own...
wretched little "happiness"
above our ideals.
And where did it get you?
Protect Gwendolyn from uncontrolled
time travel, or something will happen.
That's all I ask.
If she's telling the truth,
it'll happen again soon,
and we need to be prepared for it.
Keep an eye on her.
Can't we go to a doctor?
Go with them.
Unfortunately,
they're the only ones who can help.
I'll wait at reception.
The air's bad in here.
Don't worry,
the "esoteric pseudo-scientists"
don't bite.
I'm not going to take part
in any perverse experiments!
Your grandfather once told me
that even as a small child
you were very strong-willed.
That impressed him.
He was a good friend of mine
and his absence here is still painful.
- Who's the little boy?
- A little boy?
Here?
I'll introduce you to Gideon.
This is Gwendolyn Shepherd.
This is Gideon de Villiers.
Yes,
we've already had the pleasure.
- My suit is still at the cleaners.
- Is that why you're wearing jeans?
Sorry.
Gwendolyn might be our new Charlotte.
You're kidding!
It's complicated.
Go to the Dragon Hall
and they'll explain.
The time-travel gene induces journeys
back to indeterminate points in the past.
You could fall off a high-rise building
into the past,
and end up in the middle of a war
or being burnt at the stake.
But in this room, you'll always be safe,
regardless of the time you're in.
This is our insignia,
just in case you should meet one of us.
When will it happen again?
It's impossible to say exactly,
each time traveller is different.
The Count was the fifth
of the 12 time travellers.
It's said that as a young man
he made up to seven journeys a day.
You can imagine
how dangerously he lived.
Seven times a day? That's terrible.
ls there no way of stopping it?
If you are the Ruby, you'll be able
to elapsicate with the chronograph.
Elapsi-what?
Elapsicate. We'll be able to prevent
unplanned time travel
and send you to a fixed point
in the past for a few hours.
We'll just need
a few drops of your blood.
A time machine, fuelled on blood?
You could call it that,
but it's all based on hard science.
But if Lucy and Paul
stole the chronograph,
how can it be here?
Good question.
There's a second chronograph
and we managed to get it working.
Any more queries?
When I went back in time
at St Lennox's...
...I saw myself,
there were two of me.
You'll have gone
back there again in the future,
I mean you will go back again.
Such things occur,
although we try to prevent them.
It just complicates matters.
In the past it is often dark.
Another biscuit with orange filling?
Wait a minute!
"Phantom symptoms"?!
It's so terribly humiliating.
Not that you care!
That's not true. It's unbelievable.
I pity your cousin.
Really?
We've been training for years,
she doesn't have a clue.
And I'll have to suffer
the consequences.
Poor Gwendolyn!
Things are going to get
pretty dangerous for her.
Think of all the opportunities
you'll have without all this here.
But all I've ever wanted is to be here.
With you.
Grandpa Lucas...
"Blood opens the lock...
...and you will find
what is written about you.
Trust in your magic."
That was almost 45 minutes.
Is everything alright?
Did anyone see you?
Apart from a rat
there was no one there.
This makes a complete mess
of all our plans.
Gwendolyn can't catch up
on everything she's missed:
etiquette, French,
fencing, dancing, history...
I'll complete the mission alone.
I'm good at history.
I'm certain Gwendolyn
will surprise us all.
Really?
Who ruled England after George the First?
George the Second?
Which royal dynasty succeeded
the Stuarts in 1702 and why?
- It'll come back to me...
- She can't even speak properly.
Charlotte was trained as my partner,
she's just a child!
Gwendolyn is the Ruby.
She deserves
the Lodge's utmost care and protection.
Once again:
You have to read my blood
into the chronograph.
To prevent uncontrolled time travel
and to control your journeys.
So I can travel about in time
as I please?
In theory, but in reality
the Lodge decides
the date and duration
of your journeys.
And if I don't cooperate?
You'll be flung around in time
and won't survive very long.
Shall I fetch Mr George
and have him explain it?
Very well...
Where is the chronograph?
The last girl to ask me that question
was your charming cousin.
Shortly afterwards she stole it.
No prizes for guessing why
when you're all so nice here.
Sadly, she strayed from the path.
What was that?
You don't want to know.
Welcome! I'm Madame Rossini.
I'm responsible for your wardrobe.
We can't have you
running around in the past
in that dreadful uniform,
n'est-ce pas?
Quarante cinq, and now the hips.
You're like a young foal.
We'll be able to use a lot of the things
I prepared for the other one.
- No way am I wearing that.
- You will, my child.
But...
Charlotte is taller and slimmer than me.
Yes, that string bean.
How lovely to dress
a brunette for a change.
- Why all the costumes?
- For the mission,
my little swan neck, for the mission.
What mission?
Le myst√®re...
Le myst√®re...
I'm just the dressmaker here.
"Ruby red with the magic of the Raven,
brings the Circle of the Twelve
home into safe haven."
- Don't leave me alone here.
- Nothing will happen to you.
"Ex hoc momenta pendet aeternitas. "
"Eternity is hinged upon this moment."
"Twelve pillars
the castle of time will bear."
You will find your magic.
Gwendolyn...
Sophie...
Elisabeth Shepherd:
last in of the Circle of Blood,
you will honour and follow
Count Saint-Germain.
You will protect our secret
and defend it with your life.
Sorry:
"Circle of Blood"?
And how can I
"honour and follow" a dead man?
And what's the mission?
- This isn't the right time.
- But my father wasn't a failure,
and my mother mistrusted the Lodge
for a reason, so why should I trust you?
You are the Ruby.
We are here to serve you.
You are unique...
...precious...
...special.
You will have to learn
to accept your gift.
Is everything alright?
How would you feel if your mother
had lied to you all your life?
I wanted to protect you from the Lodge,
please believe me.
I didn't want them to infect you
with their sick ideas.
They think they're superior,
some kind of elite,
with the right to rule over others.
Why was Grandpa involved?
I think he tried to persuade them
to change their views...
...because two of his granddaughters
are gene carriers.
Listen to me:
Trust no one!
What did they do to Lucy?
Why did she steal the chronograph?
It was a long time ago,
I don't know much about it.
It's to do with a great power
that's created when
the blood of all 12 time travellers
is read into the chronograph.
- Lucy and Paul wanted to prevent that.
- Why?
I don't know either, sweetheart.
I trusted Lucy.
She was so distraught
when she came to me.
Seems like you trusted Lucy
more than me.
You won't ruin everything for me!
Not you!
I'm really sorry, please believe me.
Hands off Gideon! Understood?
I'm asleep.
Leslie?
I can hear you now.
No, I didn't get much sleep.
I'm going to pump Gideon Slimeball
for more information,
assuming he'll speak to me.
He's so full of himself.
Miss Gwendolyn, nice to see you.
I need some information for your file:
star sign, bust measurement, national
insurance number, immunizations?
- You take sugar in your tea?
- Yes.
And here's your credit card.
What's it for?
You need me to tell you that?
Rock concerts, shoes,
sweets, lip gloss, movies...
All the things a girl needs at your age.
Indefinite limit.
So I can buy anything I want?
You're the Ruby,
you get everything you want.
And if I want to donate 2,000 pounds
to the cat shelter
run by my friend Leslie's mother?
I'd ask you to bring me a receipt
for the donation.
Sign here, please.
- You and Grace Montrose were an item?
- A long time ago.
The Montrose women
tend to be rebellious.
You'll have to keep an eye
on Gwendolyn.
One of my easier tasks.
Love affairs between de Villiers
and Montroses
are ill-fated.
Don't worry, Falk.
Gwendolyn's not my type.
There's our little Ruby.
Be careful, otherwise she'll get lost.
- You all think I'm an idiot, don't you?
- A bit clumsy, yes.
The last gene carrier from your family
stole the chronograph
with the blood
of the first ten time travellers.
Aided by the last gene carrier
from your family.
They must have a reason for wanting to
prevent the Circle from being completed.
Who says they want to prevent it?
Whoever has the chronograph
when the Circle is completed
is bestowed with special power.
Lucy and Paul want the power
all for themselves.
However, Gideon has visited
six of the 12 time travellers in the past
and taken their blood
for the new chronograph.
Now we just need the last four:
Jade, Opal, Sapphire and Tourmaline.
And what sort are you?
Of gem, I mean.
The hardest: the Diamond.
But there are complications
with Margaret Tilney, the Jade.
Your grandmother's grandmother,
born in 1884.
I visited her yesterday in the year 1902.
She said
she would only negotiate with you.
Me?
Your name is "Gwendolyn Shepherd"?
Yes.
But how come she knows my name?
You can ask her yourself later.
An elegant summer dress.
In 1912,
women tended to conceal their charms.
- Does it even suit me?
- The best is yet to come...
Voila!
We've transformed the ugly duckling...
...into a swan!
Alors!
Take small steps,
raise your chin, stick out your chest.
And curtsey.
Can't I wear my own shoes?
Certainly not! Encore une fois.
Small steps, raised chin,
stick out your chest.
Show what you've got.
Great hat!
Great moustache. Walrus?
- No, circus ringmaster.
- This isn't a beauty pageant.
What matters here is...
Uauthenticit√©! Correct'?
Yes, correct.
Attention!
Keep your back straight
and your legs parallel to each other.
Pick up the teacup.
Blending in is the best camouflage.
What's that got to do
with the way I sit?
It would be dangerous
to break a chain of events.
You could end up
never having been born.
Hold the cup by the handle
in a ladylike fashion,
then splay out
your little finger a tiny bit.
Excellent.
I've had enough
of making a fool of myself!
You impertinent oaf!
A gentleman never laughs at a lady!
Of course, I'd steal your chronograph
if I knew where it was.
I'm an expert on that kind of stuff.
They don't trust you,
because of your mother.
Do you trust me?
I won't let you destroy my work.
I'm not a shopping trolley!
May I?
Nervous?
What other
supernatural phenomena are there?
Demons?
Ghosts? Aliens? Vampires?
- Don't be silly.
- What the...?
Stay close to Gideon
and do what he tells you.
However hard she tries,
she'll break character.
- I can do it.
- Stop it!
You'll work together.
A young couple: polite,
well-mannered, well-bred.
Understood?
You have a timeframe of three hours.
"Operation Jade" can begin.
Your destination is 16 April 1912.
Weather: overcast
Temperature: 10¬∞ Celsius.
In the evening: scattered showers.
The watchword of the day is:
"Omnia vincit amor."
"Love conquers all."
Ready?
- Wow!
- Stand here.
Don't move!
Sir Francis Drake, pirate to the Queen.
Welcome to the past, Miss Shepherd.
Have a pleasant journey?
‚Äú Titanic Sunk?'
Extra, extra'. ‚ÄúTitanic sunk?'
Impressed, Miss Shepherd?
You might say that, Mr de Villiers.
We've come back to a good year.
And a good day.
You're kidding!
Quick, pull your dress over them.
Belgravia, we're in a hurry.
Visitors from the future, how lovely!
I'm so pleased to meet you at last.
I'm pleased to meet you, too.
How lovely you are.
Isn't she lovely?
Lady Tilney,
I'm here about the matter
we discussed ten years ago.
My answer's the same:
You can't have my blood.
But let's go upstairs.
Ten years ago?
For Lady Tilney it was ten years ago,
for me it was yesterday.
It's so much nicer to chat
over a cup of tea.
Here we are.
Good boy.
Lady Tilney,
how come you know my name?
I had visitors from the future.
That happens to me quite often.
Your shoes look very comfortable.
Is that the latest fashion?
Yes, but yours are nice, too.
Lady Tilney,
don't trust the wrong people.
I agree. "Margaret", I always say,
- "don't trust the wrong people."
- Don't come any closer!
Paul, look who's come to visit me:
Gwendolyn Shepherd.
I'll go and find Lucy.
Is it really you?
Unbelievable.
- You're so grown up and pretty.
- Stop! We're leaving.
- Why the hurry?
- What do you want?
My name is Paul de Villiers.
It's strange
to see you so grown up.
- It's strange that you know me.
- Don't talk to him.
No doubt Falk has made you
into a real fighting machine.
After all,
you've got to sort out this mess.
- They gave their blood freely.
- They don't know where it will lead.
No, they don't want
to destroy the Lodge's work!
You've been brainwashed.
The Circle must not be completed.
The Count isn't as selfless as he seems.
- We know the truth...
- Lies!
Is it really you?
So you got my necklace.
Take good care of it.
Why did you run away,
what are you doing here?
- It's all to do with you...
- We're leaving!
No, I want to know what's going on.
You can go, but Gwendolyn's staying!
Lucy will show us to the door!
You're in danger!
We know what role you're supposed
to play, it's all in the Prophecy.
The Count is dangerous,
he'll sacrifice you.
- They mustn't win!
- She's lying.
Find the Prophecy of the Ruby!
Trust the Raven's magic,
it will save you!
- Don't shoot!
- Run!
We'll be safe
from those crazy anarchists here.
What was all that,
you "fighting machine"?
Krav Maga,
Israeli hand-to-hand combat.
360-degree defence. This way.
Let us thank the Lord
for the shelter of his house.
They wanted to talk to me,
it was important.
They really want to prevent
the Circle of Blood from being closed.
I don't believe a word they said,
they lured us into a trap.
What's this "prophecy"
that Lucy mentioned?
There's a prophecy
about each one of us time travellers.
Only the Grand Master knows them.
They're top secret.
What do those two know that we don't?
It doesn't matter.
They're the traitors.
How can you be so sure?
Maybe the Lodge
has brainwashed you.
You're messing everything up.
Charlotte just used to do
whatever I told her to.
Well, Miss Shepherd?
Is there anything
you want to confess?
Had any indecent thoughts lately?
I'll only confess
if you confess your sins first...
My goodness!
Don't worry,
I won't mention your shameful behaviour.
What are you doing?
The house of God sheltered us...
You were fornicating in there!
Falk will go mad
if we don't go straight back.
It can't be in their interest
for the time travellers to starve.
Tandoori chicken
with batura and mango lassi.
Bombay Garden,
best Indian in the world.
This place really is "different".
We're "different" as well.
Too spicy for you?
Welcome to the present.
Just because I know
how to behave in the past,
doesn't mean I don't have a real life.
Really? What do you do?
I'm studying medicine.
But I can kiss this semester goodbye.
And what do you do when you're
not trying to poison guys with curry?
I certainly don't play the violin
or dance the gavotte.
Playing the violin isn't that bad.
Women certainly like it,
in every century.
You're an arrogant son of a bitch.
Thanks.
And you're the nicest girl in the world.
"The Diamond, the hardest one of all."
It's his first curry!
It was a trap.
They wanted Gwendolyn, probably
for her blood for their chronograph.
Rubbish,
they just wanted to talk to us.
Right, that's why they shot at us.
You liked them, didn't you?
They say the Count's dangerous.
Traitors!
This wouldn't have happened
with Charlotte.
Because she can't travel in time!
It's no surprise
that Gwendolyn's no match for Charlotte.
If that's the case
then find yourself another companion!
I can complete the mission on my own.
There's no trace
of Lucy and Paul in 1912,
nor in the following years.
We can assume
they've joined the Florentine Alliance.
- The men with the almond biscuits?
- That's not funny.
The Florentine Alliance
has been one of the Lodge's
most powerful enemies for centuries.
They're an orthodox Christian order,
they accuse us of heresy.
Lucy spoke about prophecies.
What do they say about the Ruby?
You have no right to ask.
Who else am I supposed to ask?
The dead Count?
I'll travel back in time
and ask him myself.
When can I go?
You'll soon have the opportunity
to meet the Count. Now get out!
Her curiosity is dangerous.
The Count will clear up her doubts.
She's got to learn to trust us...
...like you do.
Isn't it reasonable to want to know
why we're risking our lives?
For the good of mankind,
my dear boy.
The sapphire egg in my vision
is an omen of doom.
Because a sapphire egg symbolizes...
If I hear the word "sapphire egg"
one more time, I'll scream!
One grows with a challenge,
you'll soon see that.
- Let's hope for the best.
- My tea leaves...
You'll be picked up after school
and driven to the Lodge.
Call me if anything's wrong, OK?
And don't let that Gideon impress you.
Young men like him
can't wait to break your heart.
Can you bring me back a dinosaur egg?
Velociraptor or tyrannosaurus?
This isn't a game you know!
You don't understand the "secret"
in "secret lodge".
Or do you think
Glenda's allergic to dinosaurs?
You've no idea of the danger
you're putting us in.
Gideon was highly amused
by your "abilities" yesterday.
We talk on the phone
every evening.
The poor dear
doesn't have anyone else.
He suggested I give you
some extra tuition in walking, sitting,
and especially in drinking tea.
- But I said...
- I can manage!
I said you were too stubborn and stupid
to accept an offer like that.
You're right there for a change.
But it's so important for our mission.
Just be glad all that
isn't your problem anymore.
Please go and pick up my dress
for the ball!
Jack the Ripper terrorized the East End.
Should you end up there in 1888,
every man
is potentially dangerous, OK?
The plague was widespread
virtually all the time, in 1348...
...in 1528 and 1664
it was particularly bad.
Sounds awful.
- My mum says thanks for the donation.
- At least the cats are happy.
I've got investigative journalism
in my blood.
What we need now are photos:
"Photos from the past",
what a scoop!
Did Gideon mention
the "Raven's magic"?
No idea: I can't do magic, I can't fly,
and I don't see visions, like Aunt Maddy.
I think it must have something to do
with the prophecy about the Ruby,
but I don't think the Lodge knows
what that's all about.
Well...
Maybe a meeting with the mysterious Count
will shed some light on it.
- Lucy said he's dangerous.
- This is all I could find:
"Master of alchemy,
occultist and composer..."
Leslie Hay and Gwendolyn Shepherd!
Come out of there at once!
You know this is the girls' toilet,
don't you, Mr Whitman?
Gwendolyn, I warned you.
Give me the file.
"Gems", "ravens", "time machines"?
Mr Whitman's one of them,
they're everywhere.
And he's got my file.
He didn't believe
I'm preparing a paper on metaphysics.
- Were you smoking in the toilets?
- No, we wanted to talk in private.
You skip classes so you can talk. Girls!
How did she do it?
She must have had a makeover.
It looks good. Sort of...
She's still a clumsy oaf.
No makeover can hide that.
Wait!
Who are you?
Allow me
to most humbly introduce myself:
James Augustus Peregrine
Pympoole-Bothame.
Who are you talking to?
The strange guy
standing right in front of me.
Gwen, there's no one here.
- Are you new here?
- What an absurd question.
This estate has belonged to my family
for three generations.
Our school?
Can you really see someone?
What's he saying?
He says St Lennox's is his "estate".
- Why can't you see him?
- Maybe he's a ghost?
- Are you a ghost?
- Who is this imbecile?
She should remove that thing
from her face.
He says you're very attractive.
- How nice.
- How shameful!
Telling lies is bad behaviour!
- When were you born, James?
- Good question.
31 March 1762.
Three weeks ago I celebrated
my 21 st birthday,
it was a spectacular ball.
31 March 1762.
Wow!
I think I was there too:
candle light, violins, wicked wigs...
Anyone who's anyone in London
came to honour me.
Wow, you can see ghosts!
Is he transparent or black and white?
You...
You don't happen to know a count
who looks like this, do you?
The Count of Saint-Germain,
a splendid likeness.
He was a guest at my ball, too.
A most fascinating man.
It's said he can read minds...
...get inside people's heads.
Read minds? James, wait!
- Does he really think I'm cute?
- Yeah...
Look at that limo!
Maybe Madonna's daughter
really is a pupil here,
incognito, of course.
Right:
that's why they've sent a limo,
so no one will notice she's incognito.
- I bet he's taking her to the ball.
- God, he's touching her.
He's holding her hand
and now he's kissing her.
At second glance,
I think he's quite good-looking.
I'm not impressed.
Go on: your limousine is waiting.
Excuse me.
Did you get taller overnight?
No, Madame Rossini
shortened my skirt.
Let's go, the Count
doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Corset and skirt:
not made of whalebone,
but of feather-light,
high-tech carbon fibre.
Voila. And the shoes have
reinforced toecaps, for self-defence.
An afternoon ensemble,
tr√®s √©l√©gante.
I'm a genius.
You absolutely must tell me
what the Count wore.
Keep still, he won't eat you.
Voila.
It actually looks pretty good.
You've been for a pee, haven't you?
Any idea how to pee
wearing that dress?
Have you seen an 18th century toilet?
Bonjour, Madame...
...Mademoiselle.
And now the hat.
Tr√®s chic.
You really look very authentic.
Says someone in tights.
Be careful you don't ladder them.
But I put out the canary-yellow
stockings for you! You little rebel!
They were too bright for me.
But the rococo man
wears bright colours.
Any coins to spare?
Any coins to spare?
Have mercy!
What was wrong with his fingers?
Bubonic plague,
also called "Black Death".
The black skin is dead tissue.
- Don't worry, you're immunized.
- Can't we bring the vaccine here?
We're not allowed to interfere.
Besides, the Lodge believes
that such natural selection
is vital to the human gene pool.
"Natural selection"?
Are you monsters
or just heartless idiots?
You'll see.
The Count is an impressive man.
Can he really read minds?
Who says he can?
If he can, I've never noticed...
...or maybe never thought anything
that interested him.
What should I do if he tries it on me?
Just think about nothing,
or about something trivial.
- That should be no problem for you.
- Something trivial?
Don't worry,
I won't leave you on your own.
- Is that a threat?
- No, a promise.
Lord Brompton...
Allow me to introduce my great-great-great
grandson's great-great-great grandson,
Gideon de Villiers.
Lord Brompton.
I see my lineage
has continued to develop splendidly.
A handsome young man!
The venerable Count
is trying to entertain us again.
Amusing, highly amusing!
L'heure du rubis...
...est arriv√©e?
Nous avons malheureusement pr√©par√©
Ia mauvaise personne pour Ia mission.
You don't even speak French?
Salut? Bonjour? Ca va?
Croissant... le Count?
Am I wrong in thinking
that the Guardians in your time
don't take their duties seriously?
I assume the answer to that
is in this letter.
So you're the Ruby.
What is your magic?
What's special about you,
ma petite fille?
I don't think there's anything special
about me, monsieur
Then what are you doing here?
What will happen
when the Circle of 12 is completed?
- And what's it got to do with me?
- Magnifique, really magnifique!
Excellent entertainment!
I don't think you're remotely capable
of understanding what's going on here.
The female blood is very sluggish.
My blood certainly isn't sluggish.
What does the prophecy say
about the Ruby?
The female mind
is also less nimble than ours.
Don't you agree, girl?
Venerable Count,
this insolent young lady
is challenging you
in the most impudent manner.
I love women...
As long as they don't attempt to think.
Senile old codger.
I won't get an answer from him.
Forget your questions.
All that matters is that you follow me.
He's reading my mind.
Something trivial, quick!
Girl!
I salute your patriotism, but...
...our monarch is George Ill.
You should be singing
"God save the King".
A most charming performance,
esteemed young lady.
This is our queen, Elisabeth ll.
She's very nice: she came
to our school fete last year
and Leslie got her autograph.
We ought to confiscate
this wonderful box of tricks...
Careful, it's electric!
We now have a prime minister
and a parliament,
elected by the people,
including women.
- And everyone's equal...
- My lady.
- That's high treason.
- What?
No, I think you misunderstood me.
Long live the Queen!
The prime minister is unimportant.
Such traitors belong in the Tower!
They'll be granting
the colonies independence
and abolishing slavery next.
We have to go now.
I will not have my rules broken.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Au revoir, mes enfants.
He's really dangerous,
he almost choked me to death!
What did he say
about the Circle of Twelve?
- I know less than you think.
- What?
You've been involved for years
and you don't know why?
- What did you two talk about?
- About your magic.
The Ruby has always been described
as very special.
You were probably too ordinary for him.
That's not an insult,
I don't mean you're common,
just average.
Average?
- It's not your fault.
- You don't know me!
I know tons of girls like you,
you're all the same.
You're only interested in clothes
and pop bassists,
you whisper all the time
and go to the toilet in pairs.
You've never had the chance
to meet a girl like me.
You had to learn French,
dance the gavotte,
and recite the succession
to the throne backwards.
I've had enough of all this. Stop!
Is this Hyde Park?
Something's wrong.
Stay here!
Shit...
Who are you?
What do you want?
Stop!
Pray, if you can.
I told you to stay in the carriage!
Get up, people are staring at us!
That was incredibly reckless
and very dangerous...
...and extremely brave.
Do you think...?
Do you think he'll die?
Am I a murderer?
You had no choice,
you were defending yourself.
Or me, to be exact.
Not that it was necessary.
It was damn necessary,
Mr 360-Degree-Defence!
Take a few deep breaths
and it'll pass.
It'll pass?
Really?
Will I get over having killed a man?
Will I get over having my life
turned upside down, just like that?
And will I get over the fact
that an arrogant creep in silk stockings
has nothing better to do
than order me about?
Although I just saved
his pathetic little life?
This whole thing
makes me want to puke!
And while we're on the subject:
You make me want to puke, too.
Wait...
Madame Rossini will kill you
if I ruin it.
Then I'll just say it was you.
I'm afraid
we'll have to walk to the Temple,
I haven't got a single penny on me.
You're impossible!
- Did he cut you badly?
- No, it's just a scratch.
It's already stopped bleeding.
That shouldn't have happened.
They were wearing the crest
of the Florentine Alliance.
What?
They were from the Inquisition?
Why did they want to kill us?
I'm not a witch.
It's an age-old struggle:
clergy versus Enlightenment,
Church versus alchemy,
belief versus knowledge,
and good versus evil.
Are we the goodies or the baddies?
Mr George, Gwendolyn is exhausted.
That's enough for today.
I wish I could just leave,
go somewhere
where no one can find me.
You can't leave...
We're totally dependent on the Lodge
and the chronograph.
They've got us in the palm of their hand.
But we can't just carry on
as if nothing had happened.
Good night.
No, we can't.
We've got to find the prophecy.
Lucy said it explains everything.
Thanks.
For what?
I think you really did
save my pathetic little life.
I thought
you spoke to Charlotte every night.
Jealous?
Me? In your dreams.
Where are you?
I'm worried about you.
Since you've been on board
we've had one catastrophe after another.
And you're right:
I have to find out the prophecy.
And where will you find it?
- Let me worry about that.
- Listen...
- I'm coming.
- l think... - Don't argue.
- Where are you going at this hour?
- I can't tell you.
Go back to bed.
I have to find out what's happening
to me and why. Can't you understand?
I'm in the thick of it
and you can't help me.
Please, just trust me.
What's going on?
Where are you going?
What's she up to?
We should report it to the Lodge.
It's not allowed.
We both need our beauty sleep.
Bonsoir, Mademoiselle Shepherd!
Shouldn't you be tucked up in bed
at this hour?
I know where to start.
The Lodge's secret archives.
There must be a clue in here.
I found this when I went back in time,
it's from my grandfather.
"Blood will open the lock and
you will find what's written about you.
Trust in your magic."
It refers to the prophecy,
but why did he write that?
To be honest...
...I don't understand most things here.
I've found something:
"The Count's bequest
lies over the dragons' heads."
"Bequest",
that sounds like the prophecy.
The Count passed the prophecy on
to the Lodge. Let me see.
"Over the dragons' heads..."
It must be above the Dragon Hall!
- The Dragon Hall?
- Wait, there's something else:
"The spoils of several jewel thefts
have been stored
at the Bank of England since 1943."
Great!
So now we have to rob a bank!
Or search for them before 1943.
How convenient that we...
Damn! We're locked in!
I'm sure Mr George
has biscuits and whisky hidden in here.
I could use alcohol
to get you to submit to my advances.
Seeing as we're here,
we should try to find out more.
I'll see if I can find
some biscuits then.
What in God's name
are you doing here?
Have you been here all night?
What were you looking for?
This will have
serious repercussions for you.
You said my Grandfather Lucas
was a good friend of yours.
Yes, the best I ever had.
He left something for me
that I need to check out,
and we need the help of a friend.
A bequest from your grandfather,
that's really nice.
And I mustn't disappoint
my grandfather.
We have to go back in time.
And we need your help. Now.
Your destination is 24 December 1942.
The watchword for today
is "K√Ωrie, el√©ison".
It's always especially quiet here
on Christmas Eve.
Ready?
Ready if you are.
The coast's clear.
Come on.
Merry Christmas, 1942.
"Blood will open the lock".
How come blood's always involved?
Give it to me.
The observatory!
Signs of the zodiac.
What do they mean?
Look,
a raven .
The Ruby.
"Ruby red with the magic of the Raven,
brings the Circle of Twelve
home into safe haven."
"Borne aloft on mighty wings,
he hears the song the dead ones sing..."
- ..."the dead ones sing"?
- Carry on.
"With dying sun all things amend,
in the Raven's death a glorious end."
The Raven? That's you.
What does it mean?
Carry on.
"Ruby-red drops of blood
on ground snow-white,
the Raven's ice-cold death
shows us the light."
Icy death? I'm supposed to die?
- A piece has been torn off.
- They're upstairs!
We're ordinary jewel thieves!
No! We have to help her!
"Ruby-red drops of blood
on ground snow-white,
The Raven's ice-cold death
shows us the light."
Did you not promise me
unconditional allegiance?
You cannot escape me!
It that the best you can do? Don't you
have any more tricks up your sleeve?
Bring me the girl
and I'll tell you everything!
Wake up, you mustn't sleep.
Why are you here?
- How did you manage to get in here?
- / 'm playing here.
My big brother brought me.
- Aren't you cold?
- No.
How do I get out of here?
You need a key.
Don't you have one?
Lucy said you had one.
You see?
I want an explanation.
- Have you found Gwendolyn?
- Isn't she with you?
What happened?
We have to find her!
Mr George, come with me!
Inform Falk de Villiers.
To the observatory, quick!
She has severe hypothermia.
Her vital functions
are barely ticking over.
Find Gideon
and keep him away from her.
"The Raven's ice-cold death",
that's what it says in the prophecy.
Are we supposed to let her fall asleep?
Have you found Gwendolyn?
Where is she?
She's ice cold.
We have to warm her.
Don't just stand there!
We have to help her!
Doctor White!
In addition to hypothermia...
...she has a cut on her head.
She also has concussion...
...and heavy bruising.
What matters now...
...is how quickly she wakes.
She won't die,
she's stronger than you think.
You'll pay for this!
You can rest assured
that you'll be the one who'll pay!
I'm going to tell
the Inner Circle everything.
Come along now.
Stay by her side.
Don't leave me.
I need you.
I was afraid you wouldn't make it.
I always imagined time travel
would be more fun.
It can be a lot of fun.
There are some pretty wild parties
in the 18th century.
You'll see.
I saw us...
We were at a ball and
we were wearing these amazing wigs.
And did you see how we got into danger
because you can't dance?
I can teach you, I'm a good dancer.
Or will I have to duel
with a boyfriend or admirer first?
Dancing with me
is more dangerous than any duel.
I'm tough as old boots.
What if...
What if the missing piece of the prophecy
is even worse?
Regardless of what the prophecy says...
...our fate is in our own hands.
I'll take care of you, Gwendolyn.
You're awake!
What a relief, Gwendolyn.
How are you feeling?
Is there a mention
anywhere in your annals...
...of a 16-year-old girl giving the Count
a really good thump in the face?
It's certainly possible that the Count
kept such an incident secret.
Stay strong, Gwendolyn.
The future hasn't been written yet.
It's blurred and too dark,
but that doesn't matter.
Wow!
A photo from the 18th century!
You should take a whole series.
Mr Whitman's stopped
my article about time travel.
He said I've got an overactive
imagination and need psychiatric help.
Who cares?
The main thing is you're OK.
- Leslie, are you coming?
- Just a sec!
- And another thing...
- Another thing?
Come on, out with it.
The Lodge is going to give you
the most amazing ball gown in London.
Wicked! I've got to go. See you.
How lovely...
Lucy's ball gown.
Come with me,
there's something I want to show you.
Grandpa Lucas?
- It's a nice painting.
- Is that all?
"Hic rhodos hic salta."
"Show what you can really do."
Our family motto.
I'll show them.
You were born under a lucky star,
Gwendolyn.
But that's...
That's Robert,
your grandfather's little brother.
He fell from a window at the Temple
when he was a boy.
I think I understand what
"the magic of the Raven" means now.
Your date looks very handsome.
Go on.
If he makes her unhappy,
I'll kill him...
...secret lodge or not.
- How'd she do it?
- Charlotte was his date.
You're not the only ones
who underestimated her.
This isn't a date! We're doing
research for the school newspaper.
- I warned you.
- You drive me crazy.
What else did you expect
from an ordinary girl like me?
You're not ordinary.
I didn't quite catch that.
You don't need any magic
to be special to me.
That Gideon should keep
his paws off Gwendolyn.
She needs a protector.
I have the feeling
we'll see them again.
Yes... It's only just begun.
Two of them are behind us.
Run!
- Ready?
- I'm ready if you are.
