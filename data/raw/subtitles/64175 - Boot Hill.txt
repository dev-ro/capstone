"Sheriff, I said, my horse
was stolen." "Try walking,"
he says.
"But, but I need it for my work."
It's trained.
It's an attraction for my show.
It isn't only a
horse. " " How many legs
does it have? " " How
many you think it has?
Four!" "Then it's only a horse."
It's mine and I want
it back. "Alright,"
I said, "so it's
only a horse." "Look,
he says, you the air in this
town is pretty bad today.
"Why don't you get yourself
a change and move on?"
Dirty, stupid, lousy, idiots!
Hi, Joe.
Hi.
[GASP]
Tom...
MAMY: Down south...
Come here.
I need your help.
MAMY: You didn't
want to listen to me,
but that's where we
should be heading.
Not even the matches work.
You're idiots too.
Wake up!
You're neither
horses nor donkeys,
you eat hay you don't deserve.
Get a move on.
Work for a living.
Don't just...
Don't you think
it would be better?
If we call the other's too.
MAMY: Don't slow down sirree
not even the dead come home.
All in good time.
Hey Joey, you look sleepy.
Get into bed and
go to sleep stay
there no matter what happens.
But, but why?
Don't argue.
What do they want?
Whoa!
Hello friends.
Are we on the right
road to Libertyville?
[WOMEN GASP]
Stay down.
[FLY BUZZ]
Thanks.
Thanks for nothing.
And now, what do we do now?
THOMAS: We got to
move unless you want
this man to die
from loss of blood.
You get a pick and shovel.
And these?
THOMAS: Let the horses
go beyond the hills.
It should work out
all right in case
there's anymore of
these men around.
Too bad Mamy lost
Robin last night.
We should keep on horse.
We could train him.
THOMAS: No we better not.
MAMY: How much longer
are you going to take?
THOMAS: You go along
with the wagons Mamy.
We'll join you as soon
as we're finished.
MAMY: I don't want no
gunslingers in my service.
I told Thomas, you
remember that don't you.
And he promised me faithfully
that his past was dead
and buried.
And then at the
first opportunity
he gets, bang, bang!
And he knocks off two men.
JOEY: If it wasn't for him they
would have killed us all today.
You shut up brat!
What do you know about it?
Shouldn't of hidden anybody.
But he explained in to me.
Explained it hell.
Yea, we know I was
frightened to death.
When is this damn
water gonna boil?
I'll take that bullet
out of him alright.
I'll cure him.
I'll make him well.
And then I'll run
out borrow a gun,
and shoot him in a
place he'll think.
TERENCE: Hm.
Ah... He's coming to.
The young gentleman
is coming to.
Good.
You're very, very clever.
You know you almost bled
to death and further,
you ruined a costume that
is worth over $50.00.
Oh forget about it Mamy.
Forget it, hell!
Now you try and lay still.
Don't yell at don't be fighting.
This is just child's
play, so take it easy,
it won't hurt much.
Now just lay still.
That's it.
[CIRCUS MUSIC STARTS]
[CLOWNS SHOUTING] Tonight
a nine o'clock sharp,
a great show of
international variety.
Attractions directly
from far off Europe.
The most beautiful girl dancers.
The flying men.
[INAUDIBLE] comedians.
The greatest show in the West.
Come and meet the great
Mimosa the magician
who knows everything!
Past!
Present!
And future!
For only one quarter
of one dollar.
Tonight at nine o'clock sharp.
MAMY: I see... I see... I
see... by the way did you pay?
Oh yes.
Good girl.
I see... listen how
many people over here?
What?
How many people in this town.
Oh, we're about 300 or so.
Hm, well better than nothing.
I see... I see... I can
see nothing but trouble.
[GASP]
Not for you my dear.
For you nothing but
health and happiness.
That's all for today.
You can go now.
I know, I know I didn't
go into everything.
But I'll make it up to you.
You can see the
show for nothing.
Come back, come back
later this evening.
CIRCUS WORKER: Hey Joe
bring those bags over here.
Come on it's getting late.
Alright, but I can't fly.
I'll be back to get
the others later.
MAMY: Dab it!
He's burning up.
That's all I need now.
TERENCE: Listen.
There's some money,
inside pocket of my shirt.
MAMY: I know.
I know.
Don't want nobody's
gonna touch it.
Take it.
See if you can find me a horse.
You mean...
How long before dark?
Let me turn it to
you, it's only noon.
Make sure you have the horse
behind the wagons tonight.
No, no it's impossible.
You can't go away
in this condition.
You have to think of
your safety and the safety
of the people who work for you.
You don't have to worry
about anything else.
They didn't do bad.
You'll see.
Thomas!
Thomas.
I'm going out of my mind.
Calm down Mamy.
Man like that don't
take long to recover.
Give him some time.
He'll be gone soon.
Hey Joe.
Listen.
He says that...
What?
Well he just told
me himself but...
THOMAS: Come on spit it out.
He says he wants
to go right now.
JOEY: He's crazy where do you
expect him to go the way he is?
Shut up.
Nobody asked you.
Joe is right.
He wouldn't get far.
But if he wants to go away
why should we stop him.
Listen, let him be the
one to decide for himself.
That's like telling him to go.
You shouldn't worry Mamy.
To make you happy we fixed
him a place where he's
going hide and nobody
be able to find him.
Come on boys.
Let's check to rigging.
[PIANO MUSIC]
Finch was right when
he said he wounded him.
Look how nice they
had him fixed up.
Extremely dangerous.
Remember children the
slightest distraction
means a broken neck.
An act unique in
the entire history
of the entertainment world.
Demanding, steel nerves,
and a maximum concentration.
I beg of you dear people
when the drums are
still the utmost,
complete silence.
Thank you.
[DRUM ROLL]
[SILENCE]
We're wasting time.
Damn monkeys.
[SCREAM]
How'd you like that?
And now ladies and gentlemen I
ask you to resume your seats.
Nothing to be alarmed about.
The show goes on
just as advertised.
And here's what you
been waiting for,
ladies and gentlemen the girls!
Get out there go on.
[LIVELY MUSIC]
[HORSE APPROACHING]
THOMAS: Hello friend.
Put that thing down.
Listen, I don't like to have to
thank somebody too many times.
THOMAS: You don't have to.
You're not the one
I'm looking for.
But you'll make good
bait for my trap.
That's the only reason for
me to try to keep you alive.
Yeah, looks like our
beautiful vacation is over.
He should be here.
Let's get the
animals undercover.
Keep your eyes open if you don't
want to run into big trouble.
He doesn't expect us.
Not bad as a trap.
To get out of here now
we'd need dynamite.
Strange friends you have.
Make yourself
comfortable and keep
your hand away from your gun.
You'd be filled
with lead before you
know where it's coming from.
HUTCH: That's good advice.
Put your hands on
your stupid heads.
TERENCE: Calm down
you big animal.
Since when do donkeys
fly around here?
Donkeys'll do a
hell of a lot more
to stay away from trouble
around here or jackasses.
TERENCE: Well, well look
at the nice big fish.
Listen trouble if
you've come to pull me
into some crazy business I'll
make you swallow them whole.
No.
I know you're retired now,
had maybe even started
the whole race of giants.
Babydoll is my helper.
I thought he was your son.
He's about the same size.
Why don't you introduce us.
Babydoll this is someone
from my past I forgot about.
Now if you could talk
he'd say just beat it,
but he was born a deaf mute.
Which may be the only reason
we get along together so well.
Ever hear of a
man called Finch?
No.
Wasn't it you got him
sent up for hard labor?
No.
Ever heard of a fellow...
No!
Have I made myself clear!
OK.
I bet Sharp figured as much.
Who?
S-H-A-R-P Sharp.
Stubborn right?
There he is dying
to know what Chub's
got to do with
that bastard Finch.
Don't you figure he'll ask?
No.
Finch is out of the picture.
He'd have too live 200 years to
come out from where he is now.
He needed 195 less.
He flew the coop.
Hm, so you say.
Anyway, let's
suppose he made it.
And that with about
50 others like him
he's settled in an out of the
way spot and not by chance,
you follow me?
Like a hound dog.
Because in those
mountains some lucky devil
struck gold, staked out claims.
Hey put it down, it's loaded.
Of course Finch isn't
working for himself.
He's working for
some swindler who
wants to lay his hands
on the whole area.
Imagine that some
miners tried to protest.
What do you think
would happen to them?
I can imagine.
Now suppose that
Sharp is one of them.
Sharp a prospector?
Yeah, with his whole family
and he's one of the lucky ones.
Naturally the swindlers
tried to take over his claim.
You name the price.
HUTCH: I did.
Looks like the easy life
as I owed your brains.
Good.
Sometime ago Sharp sent for
you, but they couldn't find you.
They found me.
And so Sharp gave me this.
It's a deed of
transfer for his claim.
We pretended I had
won at gambling,
so I had that pack of
wolves following me.
From what I understand you
are a lot to this man Sharp.
What is he a relative of yours?
No worse.
He's a friend.
But, but my name's there too.
That was my idea.
You wouldn't want me
to be the only one
to take advantage of
Sharps trust, would you?
I heard ya.
Say you did it to get
me in to the mess.
Spell the words
out and you'll see
that claims have to
be renewed every year.
And the year's about up.
Sneaky low down creatures.
You, this bald
eagle there, Sharp.
Sharp's children.
Sharp's children?
If you're lying this
time I'll kill you.
All cosy in your
kennel big animal?
Mind your own business.
And you, how do you
fit into the story?
I have a score to settle
round there friend.
The hell with you too.
There's no good just sitting
there stiff as a board.
You're in this too.
Don't kid yourself.
If what you said
is true that place
must be a keg of dynamite.
They won't even let
us get near there.
As far as that's
concerned we have
to find certain people first.
We have an idea.
I'll bet you have an idea.
HUTCH: This here is supposed
to be the famous circus?
Great.
MAMY: Come on beautiful
try a little harder please.
You.
It's written in the stars
that you spoil all my plans.
Since when do
roosters lay eggs?
A male?
A male!
How can you tell?
Thomas!
THOMAS: Where are the others?
Hm.
Gone.
Where?
Everything's gone bad.
Ever since Joe's accident and
after you deserted us nothing
has gone right and all the
competition here in Abilene
makes it impossible
for us to survive.
They all left me.
They all found jobs except me.
Nobody wants me.
Of course they still come
around once in a while.
They say they're
saving their money,
so we can all be together
again like before.
But it's only talk.
From what I can gather
they're still in town.
Stop worrying Mamy.
All your troubles are over.
What?
He says that your
little troubles are over.
And one so big you cannot
imagine it is beginning.
THOMAS: Hey!
Thomas!
[DISHES CRASHING]
Hi!
Hi.
Do we get together again?
We get together again.
All of us?
All of us.
When?
As soon as your
feet hit the floor.
Ya hoo!
MR COLLINS: How
often must I tell you
that I want my baths in
the morning in my room.
And the water must be hot.
Of course Mr. Collins.
MR COLLINS: And remember
that I don't want
to wait an hour before
they bring it to me either.
Naturally Mr. Collins.
And the maid must
knock before she enters.
Why certainly Mr. Collins.
MR COLLINS: And my
suits, I demand... I say,
I demand that my
suits be brushed
and ironed every single day.
And I don't want to
have to tell you again.
May I say a word Mr. Collins?
MR COLLINS: Certainly.
Go take a flying jump
at the moon Mr. Collins.
MR COLLINS: Wha...
Ha ha!
Lori, Lori!
Yes.
Thomas is back.
We're going to work again.
Wait for me will you deary?
I'll be back and finish it.
One of these days.
How much of it do you need.
HUTCH: How much
of it do you need?
20 quarts of bright red.
10 white, 2 yellow
and 5 brushes.
[VARIOUS CHATTER]
Goodbye savings.
You'll see.
Sharp will remember it
when the time comes.
That's what you think.
He's as tight as a
hungry man's belt.
You'll see.
Damn it!
Why aren't those
valises in the wagon.
If this was only
going to do some good.
When they know what's
happened I'll tell you this,
there'll be a mad rush
to get out of here.
They already known.
Thomas told 'em.
Hm?
SAMMY: You owe us
$162.32 McGavin.
Sorry I can't let you
have no more credit.
You give me that
medicine Sammy.
My little girl has
dysentery again,
from eating the dirty
things you sell here.
You know very well I'll pay
you when I get the fare.
Walk your ass right out
of here you and your sons.
But far away.
I've got to carry
out orders McGavin.
I ain't the boss
and the company says
not to give you
credit till you pay.
Believe me it's no good
wasting your breath.
No credit and that's it.
You've asked for it.
Ain't to be compared
to the guns you sell,
but it's good
enough to make soup
out of that filthy
brain of yours.
Get what we need boys.
You know what's in
store for you, don't you?
Who doesn't.
And that reminds me.
You know what Sammy
you gave me an idea.
It'll be a pleasure to kill
some of these sons of bitches
with their own goods.
In there.
Take what we need.
Think it over McGavin
before you do it.
I've already done
too much thinking.
These past few months I
haven't worked my claim.
Now that can wait.
I've built myself
a viper's nest.
Not even the devil can get in.
Hey Pa!
We need lard too.
Help yourself and
don't be sparing.
I'm going to tell you something.
The county commissioner
will be here in a few days
and if these fools
won't talk I will.
I'm going to tell them what
kind of trap you got us into.
Whoa.
Hup.
FINCH: Ah, welcome Mr. Boone.
We'll have to hurry this year.
I can't stay more than two days.
Is everything ready
for the renewals?
Sheriff has everybody been
told about our arrival?
[EXTREME STUTTER] Ev...
Ev... everybody at all,
ev... ev... everything...
Don't you worry Sir.
It won't be like last year
no, no sooner said than done.
[CHUCKLE]
McGavin says he'll talk.
You better take care of them.
I should be honored
if you'd be my guest
during your stay in our town.
The hotel can't offer you the
comforts you're accustomed to.
- Eh, tell me Mr.
- Fisher, how many
general stores
are there in town?
How many do you expect Sir?
One.
And of course it
belongs to your company?
We had to take it over
from the previous owner.
Dead, eh?
Ah, no Sir.
No he isn't dead at all.
He just didn't believe in the
development of the community
and chose to leave.
If I'm not being
indiscreet why do you ask?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
Only curiosity.
Well thanks for the
invitation gentleman,
but it'll have to be
for some other time.
Come on Pitt.
See you tomorrow gentlemen.
I'll join you in
a minute Mr. Boone.
FISHER: Mr. Pitt, I
must say I admire you.
Our great country needs more
officials just like you.
Pitt...
Yes Sir.
Come up here.
Immediately Sir.
Pitt.
Yes Sir.
Help me with my boots.
PITT: [GROAN]
Shut up.
OFF SCREEN: I want
to talk to him,
I've got rights
you can't stop me.
[GUN SHOT]
Can I help you?
No, let me pass.
You'll catch a cold.
You ought to be
careful at your age.
No one's authorize you
to worry about my health.
SHARP: They're too many
and too well organized.
So even the most stubborn men
have finally bowed their heads
if they want to keep
them on their necks.
Only an Irish family
like the McGavins
didn't want to give in.
Today their place looks
like a tornado hit it.
There's nothing more
to do about it now.
And it's all over
for the McGavins
because even if
they aren't dead yet
they'll never be
able to get town
and that blockhead of a
governor will never know.
They'll be considered
dead or gone away.
And they're concession too will
pass through Fisher's company.
[GUN FIRE]
SHARP: Hear that?
They're starting again.
It was useless for
you to come here
and it'll be worse if you stay.
Listen Sharp, you can go
around town freely can't you?
Sure.
Tomorrow then
during the meeting
you could spread a rumor.
With the spies they
have around town
it'll get directly to
Fisher and his men.
It should perk their ears up.
There's one thing to
do before day comes.
What?
[GUN FIRE CONTINUES]
[GUN SHOTS]
[GLASS BREAKING]
[GASP]
Have 'em stop.
In a little while
it will be dawn
and with their craving
to go into town
they'll die like partridges.
They'll fly out one at a time.
It won't be hard to stop 'em.
Change the men around
let these sleep.
Understand?
Alright.
[GUN FIRE CONTINUES]
[SNORING LOUDLY]
[CLUCK CLUCK CLUCK]
[SNORING LOUDLY CONTINUES]
Shh.
PITT: Thomas Lipton.
CITIZEN: Dead.
PITT: Richard Lipton.
CITIZEN: Dead.
PITT: Jenny Lipton.
Is she here?
CITIZEN: Dead.
PITT: The land
and the concession
if requested goes
to their heirs.
CITIZEN: Also dead.
Them too.
Is there anyone among those
present who claims rights
to the aforementioned
concession.
We doing and it's right here.
Our company claims a
credit given the dead man
regularly signed
by him of $52.27.
The signature
corresponds Mr. Boone.
Is there nobody else
who claims rights
to the aforementioned
concession?
[MUMBLING FROM THE CROWD]
Nobody who settling
this debt of $52.27
or even promising to do so
wants to make a regular request
to obtain the area marked on
the map with numbers 387 and 422
on a 20 year concession?
Said concession to be
renewed every year according
to Article seven of
the county regulation.
You see now judge we...
Don't call me judge Sir.
No your honor.
And not even your honor.
As you wish.
[ANNOYED SIGH] Of course your
company has already prepared
an official request I imagine.
Of course.
Let's proceed.
Wilbur Jones in the matter
of concession number 3725
duly listed on the county rolls
as numbers 757, 415, and 528
regularly signed over to
him according to the county
regulations of July
7 of this year.
Step up please.
Are you Wilbur Jones?
Yes Sir.
Do you intend to renew
your concession marked
on the map with the
number 757, 415, and 528?
No Sir.
[CHATTERING FROM THE CROWD]
Silence!
What?
No Sir.
What do you mean?
Wasn't that you who raised hell
last year's so as to get it?
Yes sir.
And now you don't
want it anymore?
No Sir.
Why?
Why?
Last year was last year.
Today I prefer working
for the mining company.
CROWD: Well I don't buy that.
I don't believe that.
If that's what you want.
Proceed.
Sign here Jones.
For James too we claim
a credit of $73.00,
therefore we have uh...
BOONE: Have you're request
for preemption ready.
That's right.
That right and then show
it without too much talk.
WORKER: Come on pull!
Pull!
Follow me.
That's it.
Hoping to be graced
with your presence!
At 9:00 sharp.
Tonight at nine o'clock sharp.
A grand show of
international variety.
CLOWNS: Directly
imported from Europe.
Presented to you by
Mimosa the Magnificent.
The fortune teller who knows
all about you and yours.
Attractions from
all over the world.
Known throughout America
and all over Europe.
The greatest show of
all times good people.
Remember tonight at
nine o'clock sharp.
A grand show.
A circus is a show
I can't resist.
Pitt, go and book two
seats for tonight.
You like circuses?
Very much.
Then book three.
Mr. Fisher will be our guest.
You're very kind.
I'd be pleased if
you'd allow me...
[CLUCK CLUCK] These
artists must be helped.
It would be a pity if they're
show should be badly attended.
I won't let it happen.
Gentlemen, In honor of
our county commissioner
the management of
the mining company
wishes to invite all of
you to the show tonight.
[MUMBLING]
All of you.
Without exception.
Thank you.
Since you are so kind I feel I
must add that I would consider
it a personal offense
not to attend to show.
Don't you worry Mr. Boone.
[CROWD MUMBLING]
They've been here.
Where's Finch?
Inside.
Nothing or almost nothing.
We're able to pick off only
one who tried to get out.
I told you dynamite
is the only way.
Too much noise.
McGavin.
Mm hm.
Noise or not.
Take as many men as you need
and do whatever you want,
but at tomorrow's
meeting I don't want
to hear anything more
about those people.
Don't where everybody will be at
the show with the Commissioner
so you can work peacefully.
What show?
If one of those
girls makes a mistake
it'll blow everything sky high.
The girls won't
make any mistakes.
They know what they're doing.
Miners on one side.
Finch's men on the
other as planned.
Only one is missing.
One was missing.
Have a look.
Please gentlemen this side.
TERENCE: Calm down.
I am calm.
Good.
It looks like a full house.
Let's get the show started.
It's finished for me already.
I... listen I can't go on.
I can't make it.
Don't be a fool Mamy.
You can pull back now.
I'm not pulling back.
I just refuse to go forward.
HUTCH: You'll go
forward believe me.
MAMY: No!
Ladies and gentleman the
show begins in a moment.
First of all allow me to
thank you for your presence
here tonight.
Thank you.
In your honor the
actors tonight will
perform something
a little unusual.
In addition to their
regular numbers,
which have made them
famous throughout the West
a short pantomime freely
adapted from a play
by that great European
playwright, whose works I'm
sure you're all familiar
with Mr. William Shakespeare!
Hot huh?
We are firmly convinced
that it will meet
with your unqualified
approval, but in the rare event
that it fails to live
up to your refined taste
please remember that
we are not the authors.
We are merely the
actors, the interpreters,
the humbled
servators of Thespis,
the hand maidens of Vianese.
The carriers of a message.
It is our privilege to present
for your enjoyment a spectacle
worthy of the greatest theaters
of the civilized world.
Thank you.
HUTCH: [LOUD BANG]
Look alive little boy.
This is no time to
think about women.
Come on!
Hey Pa why don't we go home?
Wait a minute.
[PIANO MUSIC]
Interesting isn't it?
Very.
[MUSIC SPEEDS UP]
Constructive eh?
He should be there by now.
What was that noise?
FISHER: What noise?
You hear any noise?
Maybe thunder from
a coming storm?
Storm my eye.
It sounded like dynamite.
FISHER: Who'd be using
dynamite at this hour?
And now ladies and gentlemen
a nice surprise for each
and every one of you,
but be careful because...
Because... [DANCERS SINGING]
DANCER: Put it
away, put it away.
Hey, it looks like we made it.
I'm beginning to enjoy myself.
Don't waste any time.
And now ladies and
gentlemen, illustrious guests
a spectacular act
never seen before
and one which many
of you will probably
never see again in its entirety.
An act to make your blood run
cold and freeze your soul.
- And now ladies and gentlemen...
- What are we waiting for.
This is it go
back to your place
and what out it's a
matter of minutes now.
MAMY: May I present to you one
of the most incomparable acts
of in the history of the
circus world the flying miners.
FLYING MINER 1: Thomas Lipton!

[SHOT FIRED]
Hey you.
Murderer.
Didn't I tell you look at
the fine army we've got here.
And now listen.
Now's the time to
get down to business.
What's a matter with you?
Boo!
You see that.
Look at the mess we
got ourselves in.
I told you we were wasting
time with this bunch.
Not even an earthquake
will get them moving.
Cut it out Hutch.
I'll cut it out, but as sure
as God exists if I got of here
alive I'll come back here
and break all their necks
one by one.
Come on, what are
you people made of.
We haven't got time to lose.
Hey my brother and I would
like to come with you.
Move if we don't want
to end up like rats.
I'm going with 'em.
TERENCE: I'm sorry.
Don't worry after
all I was getting
bored sitting by that lake.
[CRYING OUT IN PAIN]
Hasn't this buffoonery
gone far enough.
I advise you to keep quiet.
The hell with you.
Don't you realize if
they don't listen to me
they'll all end up
to six fee under?
And so will their wives
and their children,
because after Finch takes
care of those four idiots
he won't spare anyone.
They're not the clowns
tonight, you are.
Drop those guns they're
ridiculous in your hands.
I'll guarantee you'll
come to no harm.
I'll meet Finch and see that not
a hair on your head is touched.
But you're gotta do it now.
You still believe him?
Idiots.
I don't know what
we're waiting for.
MINER: You make me sick
just looking at you.
And I'm just as bad
standing here with you.
Come on Jack.
We're going outside.
Charlie, come
here and untie me.
[CROWD CHEERING]
MINER: You know what you
can do with your guarantee
there Fisher!
[GUN FIRE IN BACKGROUND]
Who'da thought you'd end
up like a roast chicken?
Wait that way.
The brake!
Brake!
[CROWD YELLING AND CHEERING]
Over there!
Not bad!
I'm afraid that you
are the one who'll
wind up being the
clown Mr. Fisher.
[SHOTS FIRED]
Hey, weren't you deaf?
Well, maybe the excitement.
MAMY: [GASPING]
That'll send you to the
gallows don't you reckon?
Unless you'd like
to try your luck?
Go ahead Mr. Fisher, show
us who you really are.
But be quick about
it for God's sake.
I told you Mr. Fisher
you're the real clown.
[CROWD CHEERING AND CHANTING]
Hey!
Hey!
We be seeing you soon friends.
Imbeciles.
