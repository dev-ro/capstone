Welcome to the Villa Capri.
Located in the heart of the desert
is the resort community
that takes you to paradise.
You've worked hard all of your life,
and now...
No!
That son of a bitch
is in Palm Springs.
He's basking
in the sun and playing golf.
While my husband
is drinking toilet wine in supermax!
Now the only thing that I want
from you for Christmas
is that rat's head in a box!
And make it look like it's an accident.

- Hey boss!
- Great job, guys. Very festive.
- Excuse me. This is Mr. Diver's spot.
- Perfect!
Mr. Diver make you wear those clothes?
Shine it up for me, Elf.
- Nice tree.
- Who is that in my parking spot?
Oh, that's a new resident,
Leo McKay.
Yeah, he just checked in
last night and he's actually very...
He's got a ten-gallon hat
on a five-gallon head.
Paid all cash.
Cash?
Well...
Let's invite him to my private poker game.
You got it.
I'll show him who's boss.
- In the nicest way.
- Of course.
- It's crooked.
- Hm?
- And there's a bald spot.
- So what? A lot of trees have flaws.
A lot of people have flaws.
You can put the bad side
of a tree against the wall.
What do you do
with the bad side of people?
- That's deep.
- Write it down.
Greetings, my darling.
Be a dear and get 5,000
out of petty cash for me.
Not a problem.
Got some stuff for you to sign here, sir.
Did you know that the builders
of the great cathedrals of Europe
would leave a small flaw
in the stone somewhere
just to acknowledge
that only God is perfect?
Where do you learn all this stuff?
College of life, my boy.
Well, we've got
the gardener's Christmas bonus,
the extra security cameras for your villa,
the bonus you asked me
to pay out to the entire staff,
live animals for the nativity scene.
The camels were a little expensive.
You can't a nativity without camels.
The Wise Men came from the East.
Got to give them respect.
Oh, and we have a letter
from the Rotary Club
confirming your acceptance
- of Man of the Year Honors...
- I can't accept. Can't accept.
I'm uncomfortable in the limelight.
You seem comfortable in the limelight.
My golf clubs! Oh, perfect, perfect!
So, I had them close the face
on the driver by a degree and a half.
You've been slicing a little recently.
Should take care of it.
Good, good, good.
I think I'll just run on out to the range
and let the big dogs eat.
Oh, Duke!
Hm?
- Five thou. Mm-hm.
- Thank you, my darlin'.
Duke, you checkin' me out?
Every delicious inch.
That's a nice tree you got this year.
Well, thank you,
but I'm a little concerned
that some of the residents
might not like a flocked tree.
Well, you know me, Duke.
I like a nice flockin' from time to time.
A bit of Henkell's Trocken
for my darlin'?
Whatever.
It's a little before
my bedtime, but...
Aw, it's always your bedtime, Duke.
But darlin', you know a man's nature
is a man's...
Hey, why don't I go and enhance
the fireplace in the boudoir.
Would you like that?
- Yeah, I would.
- Okay!
Hope you don't mind.
I let myself in.
Pour moi?
Uh... of course!
What is the color of that silk
against your skin?
There's a painting by Caravaggio.
You could have been...
It's plum.
And you're my plum.
Oh!
Listen, darling, I... I'm just gonna go
and... lock up, turn out all the lights,
and come back
and submit to your every whim.
My every whim.
Oh... Hurry back.
Uh... Marguerite darlin',
I... I think the...
Zoloft and the Lipitor
are kicking in a little early on me.
I... I feel woozy.
- Hold on a minute.
- What?
Have you got
another woman in there?
Oh, Marguerite... you hurt me
with your accusation.
You twist the knife. The wound bleeds.
You... you get such pleasure
out... out of my discomfort.
- I... I just don't...
- Hold on a second, mister.
You didn't answer my question.
Darling, trust me...
I speak from the heart when I say...
Yes, there's a woman in the bedroom.
All right. Well...
I know I'm not your one and only,
and we've got a grown-up relationship.
- Yes.
- So, I'll...
Well, I'll just say good night.
- I'm fine.
- N... no! Let me, let me...
- let me walk you to your door, okay?
- Mm-hm.
In your own way, Duke,
you are strangely chivalrous.
Merci beaucoup.
Still a cat,
of course, but you got rules.
Aw, I consider myself a gentleman.
And so, "Good night. Good night.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
I shall say good night
till it be 'morrow."
Can I quote you on that?
Well, you be my guest, Romeo.
Actually, I'm... I'm surprised you even
considered a little romance tonight
given the circumstances.
Circumstances?
Well, this is your poker night.
Ciao.
Uh... poker?
Poker!
I got the feeling that the Duke
needed a little... Roberta.
Uh, yes.
The Duke... the Duke always needs
a little Roberta.
Well, from the way you just said it,
it sounds like a "not tonight".
Well, I have a meeting
that requires urgent attention, darling.
- At night?
- It's morning in China.
Uh, well, good night, good night, darling.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
"A horse, a horse.
My kingdom for a horse."
Mm-hm.
So, a guy comes home from the doctor's.
He tells his wife,
"Honey, I got terrible news."
Terrible news.
"Doctor says, I only got
12 hours to live."
- Uh-huh.
- Wife says, "Oh dear, that's terrible.
That's terrible. I'll do anything for you.
Whatever you want."
And he says, "I want to have wild sex
with you all night long."
And she looks at him and says,
"Easy for you to say. You don't have
to get up in the morning."
That's funny! That's very funny!
All right. Who's betting?
Who's betting? Who's betting?
It's me, and I'm goin' in for big money.
'cause I wanna take everything you got.
I'll see your 100 and raise you two.
That' a 100 bucks!
I'll see you, I'll see you.
I heard this is where the action's at.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Leo McKay. I'm moving into um...
Villa 71. Welcome, neighbor.
Hi.
I'm Duke Diver, resident manager
of this little corner of paradise.
- These are my cronies.
- Duke's a legend.
Legends ain't what they used to be,
are they?
Yeah, but you don't know Duke.
He's a resident champion
of everything around here.
Guys, you're embarrassing me.
I'm just a country boy
tryin' to fade into the sunset
with smile on my face.
Ain't we all?
But I gotta warn you, cousin,
we play for real money here.
Well, I'll try to keep up.
- Oh.
- Holy shit... That's a wad, man!
Shit just got real up in here!
That's my alimony, I can't, man,
this is two months...
Okay.
Now, where you from, Leo?
I'm a citizen of the world.
Mogadishu, Jakarta, Kabul.
All the vacation spots.
- Military?
- No. Ex-military.
Currently entrepreneur.
International trade.
I buy stuff, sell stuff.
Like?
Gas, guns, oil, trains, trucks.
Big stuff. I like big stuff.
And a man of mystery.
How about we play some cards?
What's your game, cousin?
You like Five Card Draw, Stud,
Omaha, Texas Hold 'Em?
Texas will do.
Deal 'em, Joey.
And a five and a ten, ten.
Ace high.
Why don't we double that.
- Wow.
- You guys are bank robbers.
Gotta know when to fold.
My 700. Here's the river.
Look at that!
I'm gonna... just for the shit's sake,
I'm gonna bump it two.
There's nine.
- Burt, what are you? You all-in?
- I'm out.
And I'm all-in.
Oh man! What we gonna do?
Okay, y'all. Read 'em and weep.
- Full boat, aces up.
- Holy shit!
We warned ya, Leo!
- That's four tens.
- What?
- Four tens.
- Damn, he beat Duke.
I am deader than dead.
I'm all cleaned out.
Damn, I was lucky!
Sometimes you step in horseshit
and you wind up smellin'...
Excuse me, you know,
I think that one's mine.
I didn't see that.
What do you want? Why'd you come here?
I came here to continue developing
my business empire
while working on my shaky golf game.
Oh, you... you play golf?
Not well, but honestly and earnestly.
Well, uh, perhaps
you will give me the chance
to win back my money on the golf course.
Perhaps I will.
You know, a true gentleman
does not walk away a winner.
A true gentleman keeps the game alive.
Oh, my, my, my, my! Behold the evidence.
Whatever can it mean?
She's lookin' for deep comfort
and companionship and maybe a soulmate.
Nuh-uh.
She's not lookin' for soulmate.
She's lookin' for a few precious hours
of intimate connections
with no questions asked.
Maybe I'll just go over there
and pick up the tab, huh?
Can't compete with that.
Shit!
Well, could if I wanted to.
Can I buy you another round?
You can scram is what you can do.

Good news to report.
Mike Shank from villa 68
had a successful hip replacement surgery
and should be back to the Villa Capri
in just a few days.
What the...
That's not my regular camel guy.
Where's my regular camel guy?
Uh, he's uh, under the weather.
Oh, uh, corporate is sending
a regional director down
to do a year-end review in case it...
slipped your mind.
I will look down upon him
from a great height. Bring him on.
Yeah. Bring him on.
Ladies, have you seen the new guy?
He's moving into villa 71.
There's new food on the buffet.
Yes.
Oh, in the air, there's a feelin'
of Christmas.
I'm Leo McKay,
and you young ladies might be...
Look at that.
I spent years juggling stories
to keep those women apart,
and in 20 minutes,
he's got them lined up for a three-way.
Well, uh, four-way if anybody's countin'.
He's not showing me any respect.
- No respect.
- No. Nothin'.
But he's gonna find out this is my town.
You're the Duke and this is your domain.
I told you.
- Don't upset him, Larry!
- Duke don't like that.
- Well, hello.
- Hello.
I'm Roberta. We met earlier.
You know, I neglected to mention
that as president
of the Glad-Handers Welcome Wagon Club
here at Villa Capri Resort Community,
I just wanted to say Merry Christmas.
Oh! You know,
I could help you fix the place up.
You know, a little Feng Shui.
Oh!
- I got skills.
- I'll bet you do.
What you got back here? The dinin' room?
The bedroom. Giddy-up!
Hi. I'm Marguerite
with the Welcome Wagon Club.
- Are you a Glad-Hander?
- How'd you know?
As secretary-treasurer, I brought
a little somethin' to warm up your place.
- A work of art.
- My sentiments exactly.
- And thank you.
- For what?
Did you just invite me in
for a little vino?
Red? I love red.
I love white. I love it all.
Well, then how about a lovely Margaux
for a lovely Margot? Can I call you that?
You can call me whatever you like.
By the way, I am in villa 52.
And I'm in villa 36.
What you gonna call me?
Oh my God! How did you get here before me?
You know that the by-laws
of our club clearly state
that the president
and not the secretary-treasurer
should be the first Welcomer on the scene.
Okay, well let's just call this
an unofficial visit.
- Unofficial?
- Why don't we just have a taste
of this delightful vintage?
- Oh!
- Don we now our straight apparel.
- Oh, my God!
- And what office
of Glad-Handers Welcome Wagon Club
might you hold?
Sergeant-at-arms.
Flag flying stiff and ready, I bet.
I think this party's just gettin' started.
- Here, why don't I take you to dinner?
- All of us?
Thank you.
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Look at him. Look at him.
He's got all three of 'em?
He's bangin' your entire harem, boss.
Oh my God! Some big,
brass huevos he's got!
Is he punkin' you, boss?
He's playin' into my hand
is what he's doin'.
He said his golf game is shaky,
am I right?
- That's what he said.
- That's what he said.
Well, gentlemen, who knows
this golf course better than me?
- Old cowboy's in trouble now.
- Oh, I feel bad for Leo.
We'll see.
I hereby challenge you to 18 holes of golf
tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. sharp.
Cowboy done stepped in it now.
We hear that you consider
yourself a citizen of the world.
Now exactly what does that mean to you?
It means that I have traveled
from the Cape of Good Hope
to the Black Sea,
from Machu Picchu to Brunelleschi's Dome.
I have been to the birthplace
of Mr. Shakespeare.
And I have been to the gravesite
of Mr. Lombardi.
Oh.
I rose from the dusty fields
to the gilded halls of power,
first in the military
and then in the business world,
and yet, to this day, I retain my touch
to the common man!
For that is who I am.
Oh, Mr. McKay, you are indeed a poet.
I'm not a poet but I have read
the great works.
Would you favor us with a poem?
Pretty please.
Well, why not? Um, Baudelaire?
More modernist, maybe?
Yeats? Williams? Cummings?
Or... or perhaps something a little more...
earthier with a...
backdrop of Christmas.
The last one.
May I?
Uh..
"There are strange things done
in the midnight sun
By the men who moil for gold;
The Artic trails have their savage tales
That will make your blood run cold;
The Northern Lights
have seen queer sights,
But the queerest they ever did see
Was that night on the marge
of Lake Lebarge I cremated Sam McGee."
- Romeo! Romeo!
- "Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee..."
Oh, Romeo! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, he broke away.
He's a sweetheart
but I can never shut him up.
Sit. Be a good dog.
Sit down.
How'd you do that?
I like dogs.
Oh! Yeah?
- I'm Leo McKay.
- Oh, Suzie Quince.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
I'm so sorry to interrupt
whatever it is you're doing.
That's quite all right.
Okay. Well, carry on.
"On Christmas Day we were mushing
our way along the Dawson trail.
Talk of your cold!
Through the parkas fold.
It stabbed like a...
it stabbed like a driven nail."
Sr. Jiménez!
Miguel Jiménez! That's it.
Here he comes.
That's it. Loosen up, Dukie.
You got 'em now.
Good morning! I accept your challenge.
Well, I'm loose as a goose.
Mark Twain said that golf
is a good walk spoiled, but I say...
It's a good walk enhanced.
Except that neither one of us
is walking, huh?
Details, details, details.
I am a big picture man.
Uh, boss, we got a problem.
- What?
- This guy can flat-out play!
He said his game was shaky.
His shaky is better than your shaky.
- Wait...
- Boss.
We watched him warm up this morning.
This guy can flat out hit. I ain't lyin'.
I got a short game.
He's got a short game, too,
and a long game.
I assume I have the honors.
Uh, yes, you do.
Um, just a word of caution.
Out of bounds is to your right.
That's the way I like it.
It's to the left.
Oh shit! The guy can hit the ball.
Is that a legal club?
I don't think that's a legal club.
My side bet with you is off.
We might as well get some new girlfriends.
Thanks for the confidence, fellas.
Gee whiz!
Well, you're a thinking man.
It's a thinking man's game.
I think I'm gonna
hit a three wood out here.
Three wood. Good idea.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah that'll be good.
Yeah, okay.
Let it fly.
Oh shit!
It's a damn cobra!
- Gun! Gun!
- I... I... I got it! I got it!
- Damn!
- I got it! I got it!
You see that?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Okay, die, viper!
- You got him surrounded.
- Still movin'!
Don't hurt yourself with that thing.
Somebody bring a beer cooler, please.
Somebody put a cap on...
put a top on the bucket.
I never had you figured
for a man packin' iron
even if it is a peashooter.
You never know
who's lurkin' around.
Take him to the Serpentarium in 29 Palms.
Look out! Look out!
Sit... sit on that thing.
Sit on it, you're the biggest.
Come on.
Oh! Goddamn!
Wait! Wait!
- You're good. Sit on it now. Sit down.
- Sit down.
Oh, we're good.
I almost got bit.
I'm not going anywhere near that golf bag.
You bailin' out of our game?
I have trouble swingin' a golf club
with a rattlesnake wrapped around it, Leo.
- You're afraid to play me.
- I'm not afraid of anything or anyone.
Coward.
Doin' a good job, Burt.
- Come on, I need a drink.
- I think it's happy hour.
- ...sit on that thing...
Leo, hell am I supposed to do now?
Hell, I don't know. Not my problem.
Sit on it!
When a man lets another man
take care of his golf bag, Jimmy,
he has certain expectations.
You think a snake zipped himself
into a pocket in my bag?
Snakes don't have opposable thumbs.
This was not an accident.
Shit!
What took you so long?
Oh, thank you.
I see I'm gonna have
to teach you a lesson.
I would love to have another poker lesson
unless you find it easier
just to write me a check.
Tell me somethin',
did you move to Villa Capri
just to piss me off?
No, that was just a happy by-product.
But this anger is doin' you a lot of good.
It gets the blood circulating
throughout your entire body
instead of down there in your little ol'...
You're lucky I have a commitment
of a higher calling at home.
You and I... just gettin' started.
I can hardly wait.
Nice fella.
Tell me he's dead.
I... I... I know!
I told you to make it look
like an accident,
but a snake in his golf bag?
Sweetie,
murder him the old-fashioned way.

Hello, Palms Springs!
Thank you all for comin' out.
Duke's not gonna like this.
- Who is this guy?
- Here comes the freight train.
I got your ho-ho right here.
Yes!
That ain't the real Santa.
I'm the real Santa.
This guy's a fraud, a phony.
He's a sleazy, corporate heathen!
Go, Black Santa!
There ya go! Back to the North Pole!
What got into you?
I don't like people
fucking with Santa Claus.
Arturo.
Here you are, gentlemen.
You, my friend, are a gentleman
and a scholar,
and you are indeed here on business.
Whatever that is.
My business is my business,
but your business seems to be
sitting in a catbird seat
of one-night stands
and Thursday night specials
and Tuesday nooners.
Which holds
no special satisfaction for me.
What? No Tuesday nooners?
I'm not interested in your girlfriends.
But I could endure
the courtship of a soulmate.
Appreciate it, thank you.
Good. Good boy.
In fact, the perfect soulmate for me
might very well be Miss Suzie Quince
sitting right there.
You... you know her name?
I move like the wind.
- You mean you met her already?
- At a taco truck.
You liar.
Her dog's name is Romeo.
Romeo?
Well, I think Romeo is precisely
what she's looking for tonight.
Santa from the southern hemisphere.
If she falls for a drunk Santa Claus,
I've badly misjudged her character.
Watch this.
And I'm not drunk.
Hi.
Hi.
My name is St. Nicholas.
You can call me Nick.
Susan.
I was just... I was just doing
some Christmas tree lighting and stuff
with some people who needed some joy.
Well, I guess a half-wit Santa
who does kind deeds
for lonely people can't do much harm.
Then I'll take that
as an invitation.
Here we are. Christmas season.
Nobody's home.
Family long gone. Kids far away.
Is there a husband lurking around?
- Hm?
- No.
- First one flew the coop.
- Ah!
Got married again and I flew the coop.
Lots of coops.
- So, you'll never try it again?
- Mm-mm.
I decided my final marriage
would be to my job.
That's kind of sad.
It's focused. It's not sad.
You look... sad.
Well, I've been sent here on business
to fire someone before the year is out
during the Christmas season, so...
Well, if a guy is not up to the task,
the quicker you do it, the better, right?
Mm... Yeah.
Season's greetings. Clean out your desk.
That's not so easy.
But at least the music cheers me up.
I love Johnny Mathis.
I have all 42 of his albums.
- Really?
- All 42.
Johnny is a good friend of mine.
- Come on!
- No, really.
You know Johnny Mathis?
We're practically brothers.
You know, your hair shines like the shun.
The "shun"?
You know, big-ass ball
that rises in the East,
- sets in the San Bernardino mountains.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- You know something?
- Huh?
- Santa Claus...
- Hey.
I think we need to go. Let this young lady
- have some time to herself.
- Thank you.
This is Leo.
- Leo is my buddy.
- Hello, Leo.
Gentleman and a scholar.
I gotta get you outta here, man.
You're drunk.
- I'm not drunk, Leo.
- I know.
- Just overserved.
- Come on.
- Okay, come on.
- I'll see you later.
I appreciate the intervention,
thank you.
Yeah, good boy.
You know, I ever tell you
what a gentleman and a scholar you are?
Yeah, you did. You did.
Get your ass in the truck.
Watch my knees.
They're old knees.
Thank you, partner.
Thank you.
My friend.
Leo... You are a very mysterious man.
I just play my cards close, that's all.
No, I mean...
I mean, I mean you're easy to talk to.
Hm?
And I got a big secret. Ginormous secret.
- You wanna hear it?
- No, not really, no.
Seriously, Leo.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
You're not a serious man.
A serious man would
not have behaved himself
in front of Miss Suzie Quince
the way you did.
What?
You're just jealous
because she was so receptive. You...
You are not as charming
as you think you are.
Hey...
agree to disagree, babe.
- I need a cup of coffee.
- You need a new liver.
You should have seen
what she was doin' with her eyes.
I did. She was looking for an exit.

Hello,
I'm Suzie Quince, regional director.
I... thought...
I thought you said you were...
sent down here to evaluate
somebody's job performance,
maybe fire them before the year was out?
When you're not Santa Claus,
are you Duke Diver?
- Probably.
- Well, when a man's not up to the task,
it's best to get it over with quick.
Guys, guys, why don't you go out
and practice
your shuffleboard stroke or something?
There are many, many irregularities.
You're damn right,
and I got one I wanna report right now.
Please do.
They sent us a very, very bad Santa Claus.
I wanna know who hired him.
I did.
I made a deal
with a national party rental firm
to service all our outlets.
- Our outlets?
- Yes.
Lady, this is our home.
We have a way of doing things
here... that work.
This isn't your company, Mr. Diver.
- Protocols are not being followed.
- Protocols?
Everybody's happy here.
Aren't you happy?
And happiness is not a condition, lady.
- It's a choice.
- No! Okay. Well, you know what?
I don't need your pop psychology,
Dr. Phil.
And don't knock Dr. Phil.
He's a personal friend of mine.
Oh, Johnny Mathis and Dr. Phil.
You're an unhappy woman.
And you're wrong about me.
Well, happiness can be found
in a lot of places
including a fine bar late at night.
Alone?
- Jimmy?
- Hm?
Have the bookkeeper gather
all records, receipts, contracts,
and have them on my desk in the morning
along with every piece of paper
that Duke Diver ever signed.
Uh, you want every single one?
Every single one.
I suppose you want a tour.
Of the entire operation.
Romeo.
Oh shit!
I think you're going to be
very impressed
with what we have going on here.
Oh, tango.
Duke's idea.
Oh, tai chi.
Also Duke's idea.
Now, I think you're going to be
especially impressed with this.
- This is very important...
- This is our regular Thursday class.
Real sex, loving sex,
affectionate, tender, nasty, dirty sex
still must be part of your daily
existence.
The older we get, the better it gets.
Duke's idea.
Catching on.
In defense of Mr. Diver,
this place is always packed.
Last week we had this expert on group sex,
and he said that the...
Oh... there's experts on that?
Yes.
And he was very,
very good.
Okay.
I know that you feel
like you might have seen enough, but
I promise you this place
is absolutely wonderful.
The rocks. You can see
the rock formations.
I don't know if you've studied geology,
but I just, I really hope you can
come to love it here the way we all do.
I mean, Duke is doing a great job.
If you could just...
It really is beautiful out here.
Leo.
Oh shit! Oh, this is bad.
This is gonna be bad!
There was some blue in there.
That's stunning.
Yes, you are.
So, uh, you rescue damsels in distress,
you're a poet, and you paint.
I'm exploring my feminine side.
So, uh, are you friends with Duke Diver?
Seems like an odd combination.
Friend is a very strong word.
It's primal.
Yeah. It is.
Son of a bitch, what is he up to?
I thought you said
you had to uncover enough irregularities
so you could fire me.
Well, I'm still reviewing the books.
Your friend's a painter.
Who knew?
It's the San Jacinto mountains.
- It's the what?
- It's the San Jacinto mountains.
If this is the San Jacinto mountains,
Bob Hope's house is right here.
I'm not puttin'
Bob Hope's house in my picture.
Thought it would make it better,
if you'd ask me.
No. Do you see the influence of Cézanne...
...I owe everything to Cézanne.
Oh, I see a little more expressionism
than impressionism.
A little bit more Kirchner than Cézanne.
Maybe just a tiny touch
of Friedensreich Hundertwasser.
I remind you of Friedrich Hundertwasser?
Hm. I may have to reassess my own work.
This is shit!
Romeo? Romeo!
Oh, no, no!
Oh, God!
Romeo!
Thank you.
Oh, Leo, thank you.
Oh, Romeo. Thank you so much.
Hop in the truck
and I will take you to the vet.
Oh, Leo!
Mr. Hero.
There. Bob Hope's house.
Looks better. It's not that damn hard.
I have sad news
to report to the Villa Capri family today.
Mike Shank in villa 68
had a massive coronary
late last night while I was visiting.
My presence was a total coincidence.
Great, fellas. This is great.
This is your finest work.
Hey, where you been, boss?
Miss Quince.
She wants my neck and Leo's bed.
Well, what you gonna do?
This is war!
Everything I've worked for at Villa Capri,
everything I've built is at stake.
And if the corporation takes over,
our very way of life disappears,
gentlemen.
Miss Quince is evil.
- She is evil, but she's hot.
- What you gonna do, boss?
I'm gonna use my legendary charm,
if I may be so humble...
- Mm-hm.
- And seduce her.
Give her a bit of the old je ne sais quoi.
That's Spanish, right?
I'm gonna take the corporate starch
outta that woman's knickers.
She deserves it.
And if there's anybody can do it,
it's you, Duke.
But first, Leo McKay.
Mm-hm.
I gotta take him down.
- Oh!
- Take him down?
Tie his hind legs together
with a pickin' string
so he doesn't scratch those stitches out.
- Uh, pickin' string?
- Yarn. It's soft, a knitting yarn.
Oh, well, thanks. Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.
I have to get back
and do the company survey.
You take your work seriously
and I respect that.
Yeah. Thank you again. I so appreciate it.
Yes, ma'am.
Now what?
Renaissance Man.
What else do you do?
I'm on a journey of self-discovery
and exploration...
Oh, shut up!
Villa Capri is not big enough
for both of us, Leo.
If you wanna do somethin' about that,
I'll beat you the best of five
of anything ever invented.
Game room. One hour.
- I'm not getting fired because you...
- Make the call.
...forgot to make the call.
No! I don't care if they call you...
- Oh, good! We're all here.
- Hey!
Time to sharpen the knives,
circle the wagons,
- pull up our bootstraps and buckle down.
- Hey.
It's all here, Miss Quince.
Great. Okay.
So, when exactly does Duke get petty cash?
Wh... whenever he asks for it.
I... I just go and...
Whenever he asks for it?
You know what?
This company is not his personal ATM.
Look, Duke is an honorable man.
I'm sure you're not going
to find anything that... whoa!
Hm, my God!
Honorable. What do you call these?
Size 14, lots of fun.
You want to audit those, too?
You know what? I just might.
Miss Quince will never fall for your...
transparent... dishonor.
My dishonor, I'll have you know,
is not transparent.
- I wonder if he could lift me like that.
- Oh, my...
- In my trap.
- I counter!
This ain't in your wheelhouse, boss.
- Don't go there.
- What do you mean, "Don't go there"?
Your mama said don't go there last night!
- Checkmate!
- Oh!
Oh!
I got it! I got it! I got it! I got it!
- You've got it?
- You got it?
- You got it! You...
- Got it!
- You don't got it.
- Take it.
Take it, take it, take it!
The score is tied, Mr. Diver.
Choose your game to finish this.
Limbo!
- Limbo!
- Wow!
Oh, we got him!
I said stop that!
You first.
He can do it, he can do it!
This is bullshit!
I'll take that as a pass.
Music!
Disqualification!
His knees touched the ground.
I'm starting a protest!

Why don't you not

Oh, no, that's not appropriate.

Are you a dromedary depriver?
Okay, forget the camels.
The Gentlemen's Club.
Dancers. Right there. Dancers.
Yeah. Well, they were strippers.
Oh, I knew it!
No, no! No, no, no! They were sweet.
They were... they were sweet.
They made the men feel young and virile.
Even taught the ladies
a couple of tricks, and...

- Ew.
Golf clubs.
Personal. Fourteen hundred dollars.
Probably brought in
about a million dollars' worth of business
hosting potential buyers
on the golf course.
- Duke...
- Hm?
It's the corporation's petty cash.
You are apparently unfamiliar
with US Tax Codes special addendum 44,
parts three and seven
which define explicitly those,
and I quote,
"reasonable expenses pertaining
to a business's ongoing operation."
- Subparagraph 12, "whereas in the..."
- Stop it!
Okay.
Just... want to know,
are you keeping your heart open for me
like I am for you?
Um, Duke? I don't even know who you are.
Actually, I can't even find
you in the national corporate database.
Oh, well, basically,
if I don't exist, what?
- Does that mean we're finished?
- No, we haven't even started.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Anyway, I... I gotta go and get ready
- for the big Christmas Eve party.
- Wh... wh...
And have I got a surprise for you!
I don't want a surprise.
- I'm sure it's very nice.
- You shut up!
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
we invite you to please
put your hands together
and give it up
for our beloved leader, Duke Diver.
Hello, everybody.
Merry Christmas!
Mer-ry Christmas!
And I'm saying it like that
because this is really
a special Christmas today,
and I think this is going to be one
you will remember far into your future
which I hope is very long.
But this Christmas is uh, very special
to me because I want to dedicate it.
I want to dedicate it
to a very special lady.
Her name is Miss Suzie Quince,
wherever she is.
There she is!
Miss Quince,
would you mind stepping forward
so we know who you are?
Please, just a couple of steps forward.
Here she is, ladies and gentlemen.
Hi.
On this special day
in this special season, Susan,
I'm dedicating this one to you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Johnny Mathis!
- Holy shit! Did you see that?
- Atta boy, Dukie!
You did it again!
It's good to see you, my friend.
Welcome, welcome.
I'll be on the piano for you.
This is gonna go well.
Okay. Thank you. Hi, guys. All right.

It doesn't matter. We got your back, boss.
Yeah, even if you're outta bounds,
I got the foot mashie going.
And I got a hole in my pocket
and a half dozen extra balls.
And I got a short game.
We got you rigged to win!
Ah, we got you covered.
I wouldn't even worry about it.
Cowboy and the playboy.
- I got my money on the playboy.
- All right, all right.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this morning's contest
will be 18 holes of match play golf
between Mr. Diver and Mr. McKay,
according to official USGA rules.
Now, I just wanna say before we begin
that even though
there can only be one winner...
Oh, shut up!
I think I have the honors here.
- Yep.
- Oh,
we're starting to kick it now!
Oh!
Son of a bitch!
Holy!
All right, baby!
All right, Duke. Have at it.
Show us what you got.
Come on, let it rip.
Quiet, please!
You don't gotta tell me
to shut up. Let it rip, boss. Let it rip.
Leo, pay attention. One hand.
- One hand.
- Waggling.
Yes.
Yes! Yes!
Let's go! Let's go!
Ow! That's how you do it!
Right down the fairway!
- Yes!
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Feelin' it!
No, no problem.
I got this, I got this.
Yes, Duke!
Settle.
- Damn, smoother...
- Oh, good break!
That ball is out of bounds.
- Huh?
- Out of bounds.
Lucky bounce. Must have hit a tree.
Oh!
Yeah, great shot,
great shot, chief!
All right, Duke, have at it!
- Oh, boy.
- You're lookin' real good.
Oh, cowboy, what you gonna do now, cowboy?
All right. This is bullshit.
- What you talkin' about?
- It's bullshit.
Are you accusing me of conduct
unbecoming a man of my reputation?
I am accusing you of conduct
consistent with a man of your reputation.
You been cheatin' all day long.
And if I'm keepin' the score correctly,
you will have to hole that ball
on that green to beat me.
Okay.
Okay.
You got this shot.
Watch this.
Tell you what, why don't we, uh,
run up here right quick
and read the green.
- Great thinking.
- Not so fast.
I don't trust you and I never will.
Ah, we plum-bobbing that!
I'm keepin' my eye on you, man,
just like a hawk.
God damn!
Oh shit! Oh shit!
- Everybody all right?
- Shit!
They found me! They found me!
- Everyone's okay.
- Are you okay?
Stay calm. Stay calm.
We'll have the EMS here in a minute.
Holy shit!
Probably just a gasoline leak.
It's an electric cart!
Where's my hat? Where's my hat?
Where you goin'?
You want a taste?
It's Leo, and I don't want a taste.
Open up.
Leo?
You forfeit. I win the golf match.
You can have the damn golf match.
Somebody wants me dead!
Who wants you dead? Who are you?
It... it's, a...
So, I'm the trophy for a golf match.
I mean, it's not the first time
men have fought over me.
Which one of you children is winning?
No, no, no.
We... we... we're not fighting over you.
That would be sexist and outrageous.
No, we're fighting
over the right to court you.
There's a difference?
These are fine distinctions that men make.
Yeah, yeah, we... you misunderstood.
We honor, praise and glorify you.
No criminal intent on Duke's part,
it's just Duke being Duke.
Thank you, Leo.
Do you men hear yourselves?
- No.
- Sh... should we?
Excuse me. I trust I've made my point.
Oh, by the way, did you hear a loud boom
a few minutes ago?
- Uh-uh.
- No, no.
You?
Corporate's up my ass
and you're both lying to me.
You better report this
to the county sheriff.
Oh, no, no. No, Leo, I beg you.
Don't take this to the law.
Leo. Leo! Leo, where you going?
Leo, it's not safe for me
around here anymore.
- You've got to get me the hell outta here.
- Why would I do that for you?
Because you don't want bloody chunks of me
raining all over Villa Capri!
All right, I'll get you outta here
but on one condition.
You tell me everything. No more bullshit.
Now, why would I bullshit you, Leo?
Okay. Bloody chunks it is.
Uh, okay, okay. Okay.
No... no more bullshit.
You blew up a golf cart?
And he wasn't in it?
No, it is not your fault.
Your... your... your father
never let you murder anyone.
No, he... he always said
that you did the best digging.
But sweetheart,
how many men did you bury
from snakebites and bombs?
Zero!
They all died from bullet holes!
So go get some bullets,
and do it like your father used to do it!
Who the hell are you?
My real name is William J. DuPrees.
I was known for many years as Sweet Willy.
I was chief counsel for the Bruno family.
Mob.
Until I learned that they weren't really
in the trucking business.
And then Feds came around
and offered me a choice.
- And?
- I rolled over like a trained show dog.
The problem was there was this crazy wife
and a crazier son, even,
who threatened to kill me at the trial.
And then when the brakes went out
on my car a week later,
around came the Feds again...
And you went into witness protection.
And turned it into an art form,
if I may say so myself.
Did you ever change your appearance?
And mess with this?
I don't think so.
The Feds will take care of you.
- Yeah! They'll relocate me.
- So what?
So, I don't want to be relocated!
I got it made at the Villa Capri.
Everything a man could want is there!
It is my vision that made it
what it is today.
Sex, booze, golf... and then you die.
Heaven's gonna be
a disappointment to you, man.
Come on, Leo.
Help me save what I've built.
- Shit!
- Nobody messes with my truck!
Shot my truck!
Oh, hell! He's tryin' to kill me
and you're worried about a truck?
Hang on.
Shit! Shit!
Shit!
Let's just regroup
and... and... and make a plan.
I'm gonna cut the sumbitch off.
- This is a really bad idea, Leo.
- Watch this.
Nice work, Leo.
Glad I didn't blink.
Damn it.
This is my brand-new, F-150, 4x4,
ruby red, extended cab,
custom bedliner truck!
I guess we're going to have to inform
Miss Quince of these developments.
Yeah. Her job's at stake.
You got a special feelin' for her,
don't you?
From the moment I first saw her,
there was something
about Miss Suzie Quince
that got the hair
on the back of my neck standing up.
Nothin' finer.
In the whole wide world than a good woman.
I dig the female species...
Smells sweeter than a honeysuckle.
Smarter than hell, firm as a biscuit.
Firm as a biscuit?
Biscuit, fresh out of the oven.
Oh, yeah. Butter melting.
- You see my point.
- Ah, yes, indeed.
The sun, the moon, and the stars, Leo.
That's what a good woman is to me.

You had a rifle and a scope
and you missed him?
Oh, Oscar,
just stop trying to kill him.
Just bring him to me and I'll do it.
Why am I not surprised
you're in witness protection
and somebody's trying to kill you?
- Yep, that's him. Yeah.
- The animal guy, right there.
Sheep. Camels.
Did they have a snake? Probably.
I thought he looked vaguely familiar.
Now I recognize him.
That's Oscar Bruno,
one of the mob boss's sons.
He could have
just knocked on your door and shot you.
Surveillance cameras.
He didn't wanna be ID'd.
No. He figured he could just come
and go with the animals.
Leo wants to turn me over to the Feds.
Oh, God! No, please.
Tell the police, and suddenly
the Villa Capri is crawling with cops!
I mean, can't you just, like,
track him down?
He's a bad guy. Just...
you know, snuff him out
like way off the radar.
I don't snuff people out,
off or on the radar.
Oh, God. I know.
Okay, guys, look, I... I have a confession.
The last couple times corporate sent me
to fix a problem,
something crazy happened.
Things got worse.
I'm starting to like this place,
but I'm on a short leash here.
If this gets public,
it could cost me my job.
Please... Leo...
And, he shot your damn truck.
- Hmm.
- He shot your truck?
You're both right.
We're goin' after this guy.
Yes!
What the hell is this about?
He knows my new truck,
but he doesn't know this shitty van.
Oh.
That's clever.
I think you and I could become
cherished friends, Leo.
Shut up.
Fit perfect in a golf bag.
Can I help you guys?
- Can they get out?
- Yep, every now and then.
You might wanna think
about a deeper trough.
Deeper trough. Yeah, good thinkin'.
Duke, what brings you out here?
Were, uh, lookin' for a guy.
Oscar. Strange fella.
Where is he now?
He quit yesterday.
Said he had found what
he was lookin' for and walked out.
Leave an address?
He lived in a motel, I think.
- Motel...
- You got any idea which motel?
- Made it sound like the French Quarter.
- French Quarter?
- Something like that.
- Got it.
Manager says he's still livin' here.
Unit 15.
So when he shows up, we jump him,
we hand him over to the Feds,
and he goes up the river forever, right?
- No, no. We don't jump him.
- What do you mean?
I do.
- So just relax.
- Yeah, okay...
Sixth grade was traumatic.
I ran for class president.
Lost.
I got one vote... my own.
In high school,
I tried bribing my classmates, but...
Crushed again.
Yeah.
Witness protection turned my life around.
You got a fresh start
on the back nine of life.
Reinvented myself.
Was goin' pretty good, if you ask me.
You like me a little, yes?
You need to be liked?
It may sound pathetic but,
I love to be adored.
You need therapy.
Never worked before.
Not until now with you.
Good. You're cured.
We should rotate naps
in case it turns into an all-nighter.
Yeah. Well, I'm wide awake
if you wanna take the first one.
I could nod off pretty quick.
Well...
Wake me in one hour
or if anybody shows up.

- No.

Yeah, the guy in room 15,
what do you know about him?
A very nice man. Very polite.
Bullshit.
There is one thing.
He... loves naked ladies.
I saw him at last week's
Sunday brunch at Rudy's.
They have a Sunday brunch at a titty bar?
You gotta try the Belgian waffles there.
Okay. All right. Go do your business.

- Who do you think you are?
- Give me the keys!
Shit!
- This is thrilling.
- Thank you.
- There he is.
- Yep.
Goddamn, Leo!
Two old dinosaurs. Like us, huh, Leo?
- You think that's funny?
- Nope.
Hang on.
Oh shit! Oh shit!
I have a confession to make.
Well, for heaven's sake, man, let 'er rip.
I came here to buy the Villa Capri.
I thought you only bought big stuff.
That property is worth 50 million dollars.
Fifty... and Suzie's worried
about petty cash?
She's just doin' her job... Hang on!
Oh shit!
First, I was gonna bulldoze
the Villa Capri
and put in a western Mall of America.
Oh my God! That's sacrilege.
Don't worry. I changed my mind.
I'm startin' to like that place.
So, I mean, if it's worth all that
and it's partly because of me,
I think I should get a piece of the pie.
How much do you want?
Uh, eh, ten percent?
Suppose I let you keep
your fancy golf cart?
Wait a minute... They blew that thing up.
And you're welcome to have a piece of it.
Looks like Oscar
is through playing around.
- Uh-oh!
- This looks like a dead end.
Yeah. Road don't go anywhere.
Maybe we can box him in.
Well, it might be a trap.
So what?
They're after your ass, not mine.
That's not Oscar.
Well, let's go see who the hell it is.
- You know what you're doin'?
- Generally.
Stop right there!
No, no, no, no! Don't shoot, don't shoot.
Who are you?
Listen, some lunatic gave me $500
to torch your van
and to lead you down here.
Here?
Yeah.
Answer the phone.
Hello?
It's for you.
Leo McKay.
Look up.
You're lookin' for me?
What do you want?
I got your girl.
I wanna trade her for Duke.
- That'll work.
- What?
No, Leo. He'll shoot me in the head.
Yeah, well, there is that.
What do you want us to do?
I want you to sit tight and I'll send you
coordinates of where we'll meet up.
Leo?
You're not really gonna trade me
for her, are you?
She's a lot prettier
and I'd really like to make the trade,
but my essential sense
of human dignity and decency
will not permit it.
However, we need him to think I will.
Aw, I sure am glad you're you.
- Hey, can I put my hands down now?
- Shut up.
Where?
Utah Trail toward 29 Palms.
Turn off at the old water tower.
You know where that is?
Not a clue.
How the hell are we supposed to find that?
Waze.
God!
What the hell is that?
It's an app. You can download it.
Really?
Let's get started. Drive safe.
I have another confession to make.
Let 'er rip.
I was married for 33 years...
to the first woman I ever fell for.
She died about six years ago,
and it put me off my game.
After three or four years,
I felt I should see other women,
but it didn't feel right.
You wanna tell Duke about it?
There's something about Miss Quince
that just shook me out of my malaise.
She's gorgeous, of course, but she's...
There's nothin' frivolous about her.
She's a woman of...
substance and gravitas.
Gravitas.
Put me down, you jackass!
Where's my dog? Romeo!
Where's my dog?
Now doesn't all this sharing
make you feel better, huh?
I could fall in love with her.
In 0. 1 mile keep left.
You know, you're always the hero.
I think I'd like to be heroic sometime.
How heroic do you wanna be?
Hm?
Um...
Well...
Uh, you know, just...
Moderately. Just enough.
You wanna keep
your braggin' rights to the women.
You know me well. Yeah, huh?
You think that's an honorable reason
to wanna be heroic?
I do.
I got a plan.
You know, you remind me of my mother.
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah. All right.
All right.
This is where it begins.
You all right in there, Suzie?
- Leo, I'm okay.
- I am not armed.
I am here to give you what you want.
And to take what I want.
Hey, stand right there!
What you got under that hat?
A little hair.
Ha! You send me Willy.
We can work this out
to everybody's satisfaction.
Why don't you put the gun down
and we'll talk.
Give me Duke!
Damn! You shot my truck
and now you're tryin' to shoot my boots!
You give me Duke or Willy
or whatever he calls himself. Now!
You can have him.
I never liked him anyway.
Oh.
Ha!
Oh! That hurts!
He shot me!
Bye-bye.
Christmases seem to blur together.
You know? This one stands out.
It's startin' to feel special.
We're gonna have to call
the sheriff now.
I don't know about you guys,
but I sure could use a cocktail.
Here, here.
I'm starting to understand
the affection you have for this place,
whoever you are.
To you, Sweet Willy.
You did a brave thing today.
I didn't think you had it in you.
- And you saved the day, cousin.
- I ain't your cousin.
Well, but you like me a little, huh?
A little.
There goes Rudolph.
And there goes Snoopy.
Adios, Snoopy.
Hey! It's New Year's in New York.
Happy New Year, everybody!
Earlier to bed?
Uh, with any luck,
maybe two balls will drop tonight.
Girl, you are delusional.
Hey, I've never seen you guys
lookin' so sharp.
- Or you so beautiful.
- To the ladies and ladies.
Arturo, Miss Quince, I think you know my
cronies and their lovely ladies.
- Of course I do. Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year!
I think it's about midnight
in Times Square.
Oh, yeah!
Nine o'clock in California
is good enough for me.
At the end of the day, I have to admit,
I have a soft spot for Duke.
Wherever they're relocating him,
do you think he's going to be okay?
My dear, the Duke will always be okay.
Yeah.
Strike up the band, boys.
