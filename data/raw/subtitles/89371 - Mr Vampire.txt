Calling all ghosts and vampires!
Dinner time!
You're the guests, you first.
Rest in peace.
Keep the light bright
or they walk at night.
That was close! I wouldn't
know what to do ifyou escaped.
Here's one for you.
And for you.
And you.
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.
Eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.
They're all here.
Game over.
Take it easy, it's only me!
- You bastard!
- You were really scared.
You can come out now, it's only me!
Master, help!
Master, help!
- What's going on?
- Master, inside!
Master, it's me!
You knocked him out cold.
Completely lifeless.
That's all right. I've got this one.
Allow me.
- You can't take any chances.
- His teeth!
Look at the state of my vampires.
What will I do now?
Give me a hand!
You idiots! I don't mind a bit of
fun, but leave my men alone.
- It wasn't me.
- That's enough! I'm leaving.
- Must you go so soon?
- Well, I must...
Anyway, see you later.
The sky is blue
The night is dark
The road home is long
So step out ofthe mortuary
Let's go!
Why are you still here? Your aunt
will be looking for you. Go home!
Come on, let me give you a hand.
- Morning!
- Morning, Uncle Kau!
- You look smart today. What's up?
- Master's taking me out for tea.
You'd better move it then!
Master, do I have to come
and meet Mr Yam with you?
What's the matter?
You haven't offended him, have you?
No, it's not him, it's just that I've
never been to a Western tea before.
I'm afraid I might do something
to embarrass you.
How thoughtful ofyou.
You don't want to embarrass me?
You don't have to come, then.
I've never been to a Western tea
either. I might do something wrong.
I should bring Man Choi, so I can
get him to do everything first.
- Man Choi.
- I'm coming!
Master, did you call me?
Since you've behaved yourselftoday,
I will take you after all.
- Great!
- Let's go.
- Do you have a reservation, sir?
- A what?
- We're joining Mr Yam for tea.
- Mr Yam? ln that case, follow me.
This way.
- Uncle Kau.
- Mr Yam. Please sit down.
- This is Mr Yam.
- Mr Yam.
Take a seat.
I hear your daughter's back
from the city. Where is she?
She's been really busy with her
beauty classes since she came back.
She'll need them, if she looks
anything like her father!
Here she is now.
- Dad.
- This is Uncle Kau.
- Uncle Kau.
- Sit down, please.
She's all grown-up now.
Yes, isn't she just!
What would you like to drink?
- Coffee for me.
- OK.
Coffee?
- Can I have a coffee?
- Me, too.
Master, what are you having?
- Coffee for me, too.
- OK.
Master, I don't want coffee,
can I have a Coke instead?
No, you're having coffee.
So Uncle Kau, have you chosen a date
for my father's exhumation yet?
Well, I think you should reconsider
digging up his body.
I've considered the matter
very carefully.
But my fortune-teller said a reburial
would bring me lots of good luck.
- You can't trust fortune-tellers.
- And we can trust you?
She's got a point.
Don't interrupt us, kid.
Well, ifyou insist,
we'll do it in three days.
- What should we bring?
- Money, of course.
How much do you want exactly?
It doesn't matter, name your price.
Mr Yam, Mr Wong has arrived.
I'm going to say hello to a friend.
Help yourselves.
Bring the custard tarts.
Master, which one
should I drink first?
I can't help you.
Sorry about that, Uncle Kau.
Drink your coffee
while it's still hot.
Please, go ahead.
Please!
Uncle Kau, you take it black, then?
Yes, I like black coffee.
- Dad, would you like some milk?
- OK.
Dad, I need to buy some make-up.
All right, I'll meet you later.
Dig in.
- I'll help myself.
- Watch your manners.
Mr Yam, how many sugars
would you like?
- I'm fine.
- You take it without sugar, then?
I need some sugar.
Master, it's too sweet.
Just eat it.
I'm going to pick up some groceries.
A young lady from across the way
is coming in for some make-up.
Don't be disrespectful
just because she's a hooker.
Of course not, Auntie. Go on now.
Don't worry, I know what to do.
Where can I buy some make-up?
She's so pretty,
you'd never know she was a hooker.
What a pity!
Help yourself, miss.
- My aunt said you were coming.
- Who is your aunt?
The lady you just spoke to.
I was just asking her where I could
buy make-up. I don't know her.
She must be lying.
Never mind. Why don't you try this?
- Well. When did you learn to ah...
- Learn to what?
You know what I mean.
My mum taught me when I was twelve.
What? Your mother taught you?!
Yes, but she died soon after.
So then I went to the city to study.
Isn't this colour beautiful?
- How old are you?
- I'm eighteen.
She's been doing it for six years.
- Have you ever thought of giving up?
- No.
I'll still be doing this
when I'm eighty.
- Is someone forcing you to do it?
- No one's forcing me, I love it!
Every woman loves it.
- Have you ever thought of retiring?
- No.
I want to teach all the girls here
what I learnt in the city.
I'm sure they'll like it.
No they won't,
you're leading them astray.
You're so conservative!
It's not about being conservative,
it's about morality.
I don't want your dirty money.
Go back to Yee Hung Garden
where you belong.
What's going on here?
Here you are!
What's the matter?
- Have you been to Yee Hung Garden?
- No!
So how do you know her?
She's the daughter of Mr Yam,
the millionaire.
What is Yee Hung Garden?
- A teahouse.
- A whorehouse.
What?
- A brothel.
- A restaurant.
What did you say?
It's a brothel.
You think I'm a...
Miss...
..l was really surprised.
Dad! I'm going home now.
Ting.
- Mr Yam.
- Ting, Ting.
What is going on?
Stupid twit!
Pray with all sincerity.
Uncle Kau.
My fortune-teller said this was
a very rare piece of land.
- And a good grave.
- I agree.
For optimum feng shui, the
dragonfly-style grave must be used.
Ofthe 3.4 yards length,
only 4 feet can be used.
And ofthe 1 .3 yards width,
only 3 feet can be used.
It's a tricky one.
- He's buried vertically.
- Well done.
Vertically?
Master, what do you mean vertically?
ls it a kind offoreign burial?
Shut up!
Uncle Kau, is the ceremony over?
- Can we start digging now?
- Yes.
Let's get going.
Master, what do you mean by vertical?
It means he is buried standing up.
- Am I right?
- Absolutely!
My good fortune depends
on the arrangement of my dad's grave.
How's your business?
Our family business
has been getting worse and worse.
I can't figure out why.
Was your father on good terms
with the fortune-teller?
Pardon?
Did your father and he
have a falling out?
This land used to belong
to the fortune-teller,
but my father bought it
for a lot of money.
Are you sure he didn't use more
persuasive means?
He was forced then.
Otherwise he wouldn't have
told you to do this.
The fortune-teller deliberately
gave you the wrong instructions.
- What do you mean?
- There shouldn't be concrete here.
All this dragonfly stuff,
he mixed it all up.
It doesn't work like this.
But it's not that bad.
At least he suggested a reburial.
He's only ruined halfyour life,
your descendants will be fine.
The coffin's in sight!
Pull out the nails.
We're going to open the coffin.
All those aged 36, 22, 35 and 48,
and those with the star sign
Capricorn, turn around.
Are you ready? Open the coffin.
- Dad.
- Granddad.
I'm very sorry to have disturbed you.
Uncle Kau,
can we still use this grave?
No, we can't. It has been ruined.
It's not a dragonfly grave any more.
It's useless now.
Now what?
I suggest a cremation right here.
What? My father was afraid offire.
I couldn't do that to him.
But there might be problems.
You can do whatever you like
apart from cremation.
There must be another way.
OK, we'll take him to our mortuary
for now.
I'll find him a plot tomorrow
so he can rest in peace.
Put the lid back on and let's go.
Mr Yam, you can go now.
You two stay and put some burning
incense sticks on the graves.
I want incense burning
on every grave.
Such a young girl. What a waste!
It's not a waste.
Thank you!
This incense looks weird.
Come on. Let's go tell Master.
There must be something wrong.
This incense won't burn properly.
It's a bad omen.
Misfortune lies ahead. Someone
in the family is going to die.
- In Mr Yam's family?
- Yes, who else?
It's none of our business. Forget it.
It could be Mr Yam's daughter.
It could be anyone. Who cares?
His daughter!
It's none of our business, remember?
Forget that!
lf I save her, she might marry me.
- This should be a fair competition.
- Fine.
- Master, please help them.
- Come on, Master.
I will help them,
that's why I brought the coffin back.
What's wrong with it?
The coffin's fine,
it's the corpse I'm worried about.
There was something funny about it.
Yeah, it's still in perfect condition
after twenty years.
He's decomposing!
Put on the cover, quick!
- Paper, brush, ink, knife and sword.
- What?
Bring me some paper, a brush,
some ink, a knife and a sword!
Master, that's my pet chicken.
That's fine, fine...
Hold this and stop your nonsense.
- What's that?
- It's an ink pot.
- Master, what's the ink for?
- Paint some lines on the coffin.
I want lines
the whole length ofthe coffin.
There are good men and bad men.
There are corpses and vampires.
And then there are men and women.
Don't interrupt when I'm talking.
That corpse
is turning into a vampire.
How can a corpse turn into a vampire?
- How can a dead man turn bad?
- Because he gives up easily.
A corpse becomes a vampire
for a breath offresh air.
Really? Why do they need air?
If a man is harbouring resentment
or hatred before his death,
air will become trapped
in his throat.
He hadn't breathed his last.
A man mustn't give up.
And he must have breathed his last,
or he'll become a vampire.
Can't you be quiet for one minute?
See me when you're finished.
I want it done properly.
- OK, done.
- Make sure we haven't missed any.
- Look.
- Where?
Here.
Idiot!
- Here.
- Come back here.
Stop, stop.
Master.
You liar!
Here, hold this!
Why did you run off and leave me?
It was all your fault,
you shouldn't have made fun of me.
But it's very late to go home now.
What ifyou run into a ghost?
Well, I'd rather run into them
than go back and see Master.
What a heavy sleeper -just perfect
for a mortician's assistant!
- Drink up.
- Anything new down at the station?
Not much. My men can take care of it.
Ting has become a lady now.
Yes, she's all grown-up.
- She'll be getting married soon.
- Yes, I know.
I would like to...
..have more tea? Here you are.
Sir, Uncle Kau's here.
Mr Yam.
- How are the reburial plans?
- I'm taking care of it.
- Let's talk in my study.
- OK.
You two behave yourselves.
- Uncle, I want to...
- I'll talk to you later.
Miss Yam, I'm sorry
about the misunderstanding.
Hold it!
What do you two think you're doing?
Watch your hands!
You're trying to
make a pass at my cousin.
Are you OK, Ting?
Wai.
My cousin's furious!
She's just too nice to say so.
Right?
You're right, it's all our fault.
We shouldn't have come.
We'll go out to the garden.
Grey hair, a sign of senility.
- Is it yours?
- No! It can't be!
I've never had grey hairs.
What I was just talking
to Uncle about concerns you.
Remember when we used to
play together?
Even though we lived in separate
houses we grew up together.
We've known each other for ages,
but we've never even held hands.
I'm not like those rude guys.
- You've got to swallow this.
- Why me?
It has to be you.
You pulled the hair out.
Swallow it and you will be
the same person as him.
You can do whatever you like to him.
Ready? Come on.
Slap yourself.
What if he hits himself?
No one would be that stupid.
Come on, harder!
Don't stop.
What are you doing?
- Why did you stop?
- It hurts.
Let me help you.
Keep your hands off me.
Wai!
I'm so rude! Hand, please slap me.
Some people do hit themselves
on purpose.
I don't want to play any more.
Why not? We're making him look like
a fool, not the other way round.
Let's try something else.
- Take offyour clothes.
- I can't.
Relax, you may be stripping out here,
but he'll be stripping in there.
Wai.
Dad!
You idiot! Stop fooling around.
Go home!
Uncle!
I'll have some more tea.
There's been a murder
at Yam's place!
Keep back! Everybody back!
Mr Yam has been brutally murdered.
Ting, Uncle may be dead,
but I'm still here.
Stop messing around here.
Yes, sir.
Go and see ifthat corpse
is still at our place.
OK.
Wai, how did Mr Yam die?
He was shot dead.
Why are there
so many wounds around his neck?
The murderer's a trained killer
who is very good at throwing darts.
His used his special darts
to kill Mr Yam.
Where are the darts, then?
Don't interrupt my investigation. If
you know so much, you tell us then.
He was stabbed by long fingernails.
Really? So the murderer
must have very long fingernails.
Listen up. Does anyone have
fingernails longer than this?
- You can't do this.
- I never make false accusations.
You've got the longest fingernails,
so you're the prime suspect.
- Men! Take him away!
- Yes, sir.
Ting, we've arrested a suspect.
I'll avenge Uncle's death for you.
Wai, you must be sure.
You shouldn't accuse innocent people.
I know, I know.
Come on, carry Mr Yam's body
back to the station.
I'll make you confess your crime.
Take him away.
- Master, the coffin's...
- ..smashed.
- The corpse is...
- ..gone.
- Master?
- He's been arrested.
Behave.
Captain, can I have a word with them?
All right, but be quick,
I'm doing you a favour.
- Have you searched everywhere?
- Yes, even in the other coffins.
- This is going to be a bad night.
- Yes, Master, you're going to jail.
No. I mean there'll be two vampires
around tonight.
Two ofthem?!
Mr Yam was killed by a vampire,
so now he'll turn into a vampire.
A father and son partnership.
- Have you finished?
- Just a minute.
Sheng, bring my tools
to the station tonight.
Man Choi, you protect Ting.
What can I do?
Hold your breath
and they won't find you.
Hold my breath.
Master, what do you want me to bring?
Chicken blood, some ink
and sacred paper.
Time's up. Save your words
for his funeral. Go on!
Sticky rice.
Remember to bring sticky rice, too.
Move, come on.
I'll avenge my uncle's death.
- Why did you kill my uncle?
- Why would I kill him?
You're a tough one.
Do you know what this is?
- Don't do it.
- Why not?
I've branded bad guys like you
with this before.
It makes the skin shrivel up.
I'm going to test it out on you now.
- You'll soon be screaming. Men!
- Yes, sir!
"Cutie"
Hold this.
See what happened.
Ifyou don't want your skin
to be branded with the word cutie,
confess your crime before dawn.
Understand?
Ifyou don't let me go, you're
responsible for the consequences.
Still so stubborn?
Take him to his cell!
Uncle, I'll avenge your death
so you can rest in peace.
I want your confession before dawn.
- What are you standing there for?
- No reason.
I'm waiting for you
to pull your head back.
- Why?
- I don't want you to lose face.
Nonsense. Help me with this.
Stop, stop.
- Do you have any better ideas?
- Yes.
But you must promise
not to yell at me, Master.
I won't. Quick!
What the hell are you doing?
You're not stuck now, are you?
You stupid, little...
Master, remember what you said.
You promised not to yell at me.
- Did you bring my stuff?
- Yes.
Chicken blood, ink pot,
and sacred paper.
- Where's the sticky rice?
- It's here.
- It's still warm, eat it now.
- You cooked it? I need it uncooked.
I was going to use it
to weaken his strength.
Now what? I can feed him.
Master, he's moving.
Stick this sacred paper
to his forehead.
Master, he's gone.
Go after him.
Go on!
Hurry up!
What's happening?
Go and check it out!
What are you staring at?
It's only my uncle.
- Come on, fix that bed.
- Yes, sir.
Uncle, it's just as well I came in
or they'd be torturing you by now.
- The bed's OK now.
- Carry him to the bed.
You can go now and lock the door.
- Don't open it no matter what.
- Yes, sir.
- This is my moment of glory.
- Don't remove the sacred paper!
You can't hide from me. Come on out.
- Look out behind you!
- Behind me is my uncle.
- My uncle.
- He's a vampire now.
Come on.
Duck!
- Open the door!
- We won't open it for anything!
I'm your captain, open the door.
Quickly, quickly. Hurry up.
Help!
Uncle Kau, help me!
- Throw me the keys.
- Right.
Catch!
Help me!
Hold your breath.
Don't follow me!
Master, let me help you.
- No way, not that again.
- I've got another idea.
Uncle Kau, help!
Well done, open the door.
Help, Uncle Kau!
Pull the line.
It's almost dawn. He's not coming.
Why don't you go and get some sleep?
If I'm not here,
who will protect you?
Why are you carrying
that ugly bamboo stick?
Don't underestimate it.
It's my greatest invention,
though it's not of much use now.
What a beauty!
Don't worry! I'll protect you.
Hold your breath.
I can't stand it any more.
Go and find a rope to tie him up.
Not only can I talk again,
I can sing.
Three blind mice, three blind mice...
Let's go.
Master!
Man Choi, give us a hand.
Man Choi.
Jump down.
Charge! Charge! Charge!
Why aren't you following me?
Why are you so gutless?
Useless cowards!
He left too quickly.
Otherwise I'd have shot him dead.
- Are any ofyou injured?
- No.
Master, Man Choi was bitten.
Will he turn into a vampire?
It's possible.
Step aside, let me shoot him now.
I said maybe. I think I can save him.
- How?
- What do we do?
We need some sticky rice
to soak up the poison.
- Sticky rice.
- Sticky rice.
Ting, it's not safe here,
you'd better come and stay with us.
Great!
You smell so good.
Don't worry, I'll be better soon.
- I'm not worried.
- And what if I turn into a vampire?
Now look who's worrying.
- Do your wounds hurt?
- No.
That's not good.
The muscle must be dead.
- Master, you're trying to scare me.
- Why would I do that?
Look, you've lost your feeling.
How come?
The poison is spreading
throughout your body.
Even if I tore you to pieces
you wouldn't feel a thing.
What should I do?
- Move.
- Move what?
- Move your body and don't stop.
- What if I stop?
Your blood will block up
into little lumps.
- And then what?
- It will stop flowing.
And then what?
- It will become solid as a rock.
- And then what?
Then you'll be a vampire,
and there's nothing more I can do.
- So what should I do, then?
- Get up and dance around. Hurry up!
Get some sticky rice
and scatter it on his bed.
Ting, would you cook
some sticky rice soup for Man Choi?
Don't let any smoke
from the fire get into the rice.
Master, this is all we've got left.
We'll get some more rice
for the soup then.
Take offyour shoes
and jump on the bed.
Jump on the bed? Why?
To stop the poison
getting into your feet.
- Master, what's the sticky rice for?
- Cleaning out the poison.
- It hurts my feet.
- You can stop, ifyou like.
I'll carry on.
- Go and buy some sticky rice.
- Can't I buy ordinary rice?
- Sure, ifyou want him to die.
- All right!
You scumbag!
Get down.
Get down, come on.
Dance!
"Sticky Rice"
You idiot!
It's all over the floor,
you stupid boy.
Pick it up!
How is he supposed to pick it up?
Sweep it up.
Get a broom and sweep it up.
I'm a clever man, how come
I ended up with such a stupid son?
- What? Are you blaming me?
- No, I'm not.
He's been working hard all day long.
That's strange. Why are people from
the next village coming here to shop?
They've got vampires,
and sticky rice can get rid ofthem.
Sticky rice is for the stomach.
How can it stop vampires?
Who cares?
As long as we sell the stuff.
We're running out of stock.
- Idiot, mix it with ordinary rice.
- Yes, no one will know.
Here comes money.
Hello.
Hi, there. Want some rice?
What else?
This is a rice shop, isn't it?
There's so much more.
We sell rice bags, rice jars, rice
pots, anything that holds rice.
Then there's rice noodles,
rice cakes and rice pudding.
Also rice bran, rice scraps,
rice to feed the pigs.
Anything to do with rice.
And I mean anything.
- Even rice shit?
- Yes! Of course!
Mine costs three cents a kilo,
my workers' is one cent a kilo.
We each have different qualities
so the price is different.
How much do you want?
Cut the nonsense. This is serious.
I need fifty pounds of sticky rice.
Sure! Get me a sack.
Here, I'll do it.
I want pure sticky rice,
don't mix it.
I know, don't worry.
Come here, I want fifty pounds
of pure sticky rice.
Mix it with thirty pounds
of ordinary rice. Come on.
- Excuse me.
- I'm coming. Come on.
Anything to eat? I'm hungry.
I see.
What about a rice cake?
They're very good.
It's good, isn't it?
Why don't you try our rice biscuits?
Tasty?
All right?
- How much?
- Five dollars.
Thank you!
Dad, it's ready.
- It's very heavy.
- We never cheat our customers.
It's a very big sack.
- Did you mix it with ordinary rice?
- Yes, thirty pounds.
- How much sticky rice?
- You said fifty pounds.
Eighty pounds in total?!
No. I only gave him
forty-five kilos of sticky rice.
Look, forty-five plus thirty
is seventy-five, Dad, not eighty.
Shut up!
It's one o'clock and all is well!
Excuse me.
You scared me, young lady.
Are you all right?
Can you do me a favour?
What is it? I've got work to do.
It won't take long.
- Molest me.
- What?! You want me to molest you?
Yes. Come on, just do it.
You horny bitch,
do you want to destroy me?
No way!
No!
Help! Rape!
What the hell is going on?
Bastard!
Miss!
You were taking advantage of her.
How dare you treat a lady like that!
- But she...
- Get the hell out of here!
Miss, are you all right?
I'm scared.
Don't worry. Tell me where you live,
I'll take you home.
I live right over there.
Wait here, I'll pick up my stuff.
Hello! ls anyone home?
Can someone help?
My family is away in the big city.
There's only the two of us here.
Only the two of us!
- What did you say?
- Nothing.
Be careful.
Sit down.
How can I ever thank you?
I'm sure you'll think of something,
ifyou feel it's necessary.
Do whatever comes naturally.
What do you really want?
OK, let's think about this.
If I hadn't walked down that road,
I wouldn't have saved you.
So fate played its part.
If I wasn't brave, I wouldn't have
risked my life to rescue you.
So courage had a hand in this.
And if I wasn't a considerate guy,
I wouldn't have walked you home.
So generosity played its part.
So together that's generosity,
courage and fate -
I think you know what to do.
I think you want my body, right?
- That would be great.
- Please wait here for me a moment.
It can't be that easy.
There are only two possibilities -
either I'm dreaming
or she's a ghost!
Miss, I was only kidding. I'm not
trying to take advantage ofyou.
I've got work to do tonight. I'll
come to see you some other night.
Only a miracle
would keep me here tonight.
It is a miracle! Why is it so cold?
You'll catch a cold
in such a heavy downpour.
Why don't you come inside
for a nightcap before you go?
Why not? It'll warm me up.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
The rain's stopped. I have to go now.
Man Choi, wake up.
If Uncle Kau sees you sleeping,
he'll beat you again.
It can't be, can it?
I'm doomed.
I'm turning into a vampire.
I can't let him see these,
he'll kill me. I must cut them.
Even if I am a vampire,
I want to live a few more days.
I'm so pale.
Wai, you're early.
I've come to see if
Man Choi's turned into a vampire yet.
Help yourself.
- Man Choi.
- I'm coming.
Check it out. You tell me
if I've turned into a vampire.
Take this.
I'm back.
- Where did you go last night?
- Well, I went to the next village.
- What did you do over there?
- Nothing.
But there was this thunderstorm and I
didn't want the rice to get wet,
so I took shelter in a house
until it passed over.
I was out on patrol last night,
there was no rain.
Yeah, there was no rain last night.
Why are you so late? I'm starving.
You keep moving.
Was anyone with you in that house?
- Uncle Kau, can you still save Man?
- Yes. Is there anything else?
I was hoping you'd help me
catch the vampire.
He was badly injured last night.
You'd better go now
ifyou want to catch him.
- Where is he, then?
- Somewhere that's dark.
- Let's go now.
- I can't. I have to watch Malcolm.
So, it's just me?
Yes, you have to go now.
He's much stronger at night.
- Are you scared?
- I am not!
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Captain, the vampire
won't come out in this weather.
Wrong, this is just
the kind ofweather he likes.
Spread out.
- Captain, there's a cave over here.
- Really?
- You go in and take a look.
- What ifthe vampire's down there?
Don't worry, I'm right behind you.
Uncle Kau,
what kind of ghost did he run into?
- It was a female ghost.
- Will he be all right?
He will. He's better off
than Man Choi anyway.
So many kisses.
She must be one horny ghost.
- It's dark. How long did I sleep?
- All day.
What?! What about the shop?
Auntie will be furious!
Do you still remember your auntie?
Master, do you need me
for anything else?
Just don't give me any more trouble.
Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Master, I'm leaving.
OK, go straight home now.
Ting, keep an eye on Man for me.
I'll be back very soon.
- Shiu Yu!
- Don't come any closer.
What have you got on your body?
It's Master's writing -
to protect me from ghosts.
I don't like it, rub it off.
Don't do it. Damn!
Shiu Yu!
Let's see who you really are.
Here, let me.
Help me, Sheng.
- How dare you attack her!
- Choi Sheng!
- Don't worry, I'll untie you.
- Are you crazy? Don't!
Are you trying to bribe me? No way!
Idiot!
What happened? Am I dreaming?
No, a ghost cast a spell on you.
I should have known.
Lucky I woke up.
Lucky? lf I didn't get you out,
you'd be dead already.
It's just as well, Master.
If I'd known she was a ghost, I
wouldn't have enjoyed myself so much.
Shut up, you stupid boy.
Look at you two. One's poisoned,
the other's fallen for a ghost.
What have I done to deserve you?
Master, I've almost recovered
from the poison.
I've almost fallen for a ghost.
Look at you, what nonsense.
You're both going crazy.
Now what?
Well.
I'll get rid ofthat ghost,
when she comes tonight.
- Uncle Kau, drink some tea.
- Thanks.
Stay inside,
and don't come out no matter what.
- Are you going to sleep?
- Why shouldn't l?
I don't have
any ghost-lover to wait up for.
- You won't help me, then?
- I would but I don't feel so well.
- You're shivering. Are you cold?
- No.
Sheng.
Sheng!
Untie me, please!
Sheng!
Help me, Sheng!
What are you doing?
Man Choi, please, don't!
Man Choi, stop it!
- Help me, Master!
- I am helping you.
- Master, he's trying to kill me!
- Shut up!
Just relax and hang on.
You'll be fine.
Don't worry! I'm here to save you.
Look out behind you!
Sheng!
Sheng.
Don't look at her.
Come on!
Stop.
Shiu Yu.
Please don't, Master.
She saved my life.
Ifyou kill her,
she'll be a ghost forever.
Humans and ghosts can't be together.
Ifyou stay with him, he will die.
Master, please let her go.
OK, I'll let her go,
but will she let you go?
It's up to you.
The other one!
Why hasn't the sticky rice
taken effect?
No wonder.
It's been mixed with ordinary rice.
"How to Cure Vampires"
Hold still.
It's almost done.
There!
- How do you feel?
- I'm fine again. All better.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Good, you can feel the pain now.
- Uncle Kau!
- The vampire's in the village.
- Wait for me here.
Close all the doors and windows
and scatter sticky rice on the floor.
Remember don't leave the house.
Get up and help.
- It's the vampire, all right.
- Now what, Uncle Kau?
Get him back to the station.
No way, not after
what happened last time.
There's no other choice then,
we must incinerate him.
- Guards, burn the body.
- Yes, sir!
Uncle Kau, it's ready!
- Set it alight, then.
- Go on, set it alight!
Open the door!
- Why did you close the door?
- To see how strong it was.
- Are you scared?
- Of course.
Don't worry,
we've blocked every hole.
Even a fly couldn't get in,
let alone that thing.
Master's back, open the door.
Come on in, quick!
Close the door.
Give me that.
I'm leaving.
Are you nuts?
What if he comes in this way?
Open up.
- Open up.
- It's me! Open the door.
- Master, he's...
- I know.
Get my tools.
Shut the door and take care of Ting.
Close the door.
Let's reinforce the door.
- Is it safe enough?
- We've done all we can.
- It's so stuffy, I can't breathe.
- Relax, there's a skylight.
- That's better.
- Skylight?
Damn!
Come on. I'll push you up.
Push.
Strange. I'm sure the skylight
was closed, now it's open.
Are you serious?
Don't scare me like that.
Are you sure?
Man Choi!
Man Choi!
Are you all right, Man Choi?
Open up!
What are you doing?
That way!
Come on, have some chicken.
It's very tasty.
Uncle Kau! Help us!
Master!
- Master, he can see.
- Get his eyes.
Run!
You go first.
Come on, Man Choi.
- Don't be scared. What's going on?
- Vampires!
A tough one!
Come on, guys. Help us out.
Forward!
Suck out his breath.
Come on!
Go on!
I'll do it.
Damn it! My clients!
They're all done for!
