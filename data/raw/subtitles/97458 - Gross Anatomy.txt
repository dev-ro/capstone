Joseph Slovak.
All right if I call you Joseph?
You can call me Joe.
But if you want to call me Joseph,
that's okay, too.
Good scores on your M-CAT's.
You're 26, not fresh out of college.
That's good.
Tell me, Joe or Joseph,
why do you want to be a doctor?
That's easy.
I want to help people.
Your father's a fisherman.
In other words, he catches fish.
Yeah.
What kind of fish?
Mackerel.
Mackerel.
If you were forced to pick a specialty,
at this very moment, what would it be?
Gynecology.
Let's imagine that you're not Joe Slovak,
but you're one of his college professors.
You've come here to convince me...
to accept Joe into this program.
What do you have to say on Joe's behalf?
Joe is the most brilliant student...
I've ever had the opportunity to teach.
I really didn't teach Joe anything.
He taught me everything I know.
Come on, Joe.
You can be honest with me.
Why do you want to be a doctor?
Well, I uh,
I want to make lots of money.
Ah.
Not that one, the next one.
Ow!
You all right, Joey?
Yeah.
Hey!
Joe!
Did you run all the way? Yeah.
It'll only go so far!
Hey, ma.
What are you doing down here?
Aunt Rose.
You guys ought to go for
a walk or something.
Ask him.
Pop, I'm gonna go down to Breakwater's...
And get some hydraulic
fluid for that pump.
What?
What's the matter?
What?
You've never seen a
medical student before?
What have you got in here?
Hi.
Hi.
I gave you that side of
the room, if that's okay.
Yeah,
sure.
This side's great.
We've got some wild neighbors.
Yeah.
I just had to finish that chapter.
I'm David Schreiner.
You must be Joe Slovak.
How'd you know?
I checked the list this morning.
Have you bought any
dissecting equipment?
Nope. I just got here.
It really helps if people
in the same group --
if people in the same
group share equipment.
We could share the cost
of dissecting manuals.
I'd like to get organized
as soon as possible.
That's my stuff there.
There's an empty closet for you.
That one.

When I filled out my housing application,
I asked for a roommate who was quiet,
serious, and neat.
How did you describe yourself?
I lied.
♪♪♪♪
Welcome to medical school.
Many of you have only
been here a day or so.
I'm glad you found your way here.
My name is doctor Rachel Woodruff --
My name is doctor Rachel Woodruff.
In the next 8 months,
you'll be required to memorize...
6,000 anatomical structures,
read 25,000 pages of text,
attend 200 lectures,
and pass or fail 40 examinations.
If you fail a class,
you have to repeat it.
If you fail two,
you have to repeat the entire term.
If you fail three,
let's just say...
You probably don't belong here anyway.
Along with my duties as
associate Dean of students,
I also teach gross human anatomy,
the one thing you've dreaded...
From the moment you made
the decision to come here.
Nonetheless, it is the centerpiece...
Of your first year of medical school;
the systematic dissection
of the human cadaver.
This woman, here,
died in our university hospital...
Just a few nights ago.
It's a very difficult thing...
to face death,
but that's what doctors have to do...
Their entire careers.
Your first year of medical school...
is a daily, hands-on exploration of it.
It's not easy.
It's, uh,
certainly not pleasant.
And there's absolutely no
reason for you to do it...
Unless you want, more than anything,
to be a physician.
So if you're not completely sure of that,
I urge you to get up...
and walk out of this room right now.
Good.
I can assume you're committed.
I will help you,
those of you who should be doctors,
in any way I can.
By the way,
the profession you've just
dedicated yourselves to...
carries the highest rates of
alcoholism, drug addiction,
divorce, and suicide.
Welcome! Come in.
Come in!
Come on, come in!
Come in, come in.
Come in.
You should all know
your table assignments.
If you don't,
there's a list posted over the sink.
There's no rush.
Your cadavers will wait
patiently for you.
I promise.
Come in.
We're table 17.
No, we're 10.
I switched with 2 guys yesterday.
17 was a woman.
I told them my mother died and
I couldn't dissect a woman.
Why did we switch?
Hi.
Thanks for letting us join your group.
Sorry to hear about your mother. Thanks.
It came as a real shock to all of us.
Joe Slovak.
Laurie Rorbach.
Kim McCauley.
Miles Reed.
Lovely tie. Very nice.
Quiet.
Quiet please!
My name is...
Dr. Geoffrey Banumbra.
This is gross...
Human anatomy, people.
It is the cutting of big parts...
into little parts.
Three things to take note of...
before you begin.
One, the head and hands...
will remain wrapped...
Until we dissect them next term.
Two,
there's a container at each table...
for anatomical debris.
Use it.
I don't want to see pieces
of tissue and skin...
on this floor.
Three,
keep your cadavers moist.
If they dry up,
they are useless.
Remember,
use a delicate touch.
You all know Dr. Rachel Woodruff.
Work together, people.
By the end of this week,
I want to see every one of these
groups working as a team.
You will all be issued keys.
You can work here at night,
at your convenience.
This is a privilege.
If you abuse it, there will
be severe consequences.
I know.
Sorry about the smell.
It's the formaldehyde
in the embalming fluid,
and there's nothing we can do about it.
So get used to it, folks.
The smell will soon be
on everything you own.
Let's get to work.
Let's get this over with.
Are you okay?
I've seen dead bodies before,
lots of them.
My father is a heart specialist.
Look,
we got a used one.
It's got stitches.
What's that? Excuse me?
Hi, I'm mister Puckett.
Thanks for opening that damn bag.
I couldn't breathe at all.
Take this damn rag off of my face.
I've been in this bag for six weeks!
Are you enjoying yourself, Mr. uh --
Slovak.
I was just trying...
to break the ice.
Please remember, class,
many of these cadavers...
were recently patients in our hospital.
By donating their bodies,
they put their trust in you,
so you might learn something.
You won't fail them, will you, Mr. uh --
Slovak. I'll do my best.
I'm sure you will.
Of course, the question is,
will your best be good enough?
I've never had any complaints.
I'm sorry?
I've never had any complaints.
Keep it that way.
Thanks a lot.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
Who's gonna dissect first?
Uh -- I'll do it.
You sure you guys don't
want any of this?
No. I have a feeling...
I'm not gonna be hungry this year.
Thanks to an ill-timed sense of humor,
Woodruff's picked our
group as a trouble spot.
I hope you're proud of yourself, Slovak.
Please, Miles, call me Joe.
You don't understand.
She can make or break our careers.
I'm gonna get to know Woodruff,
and let her get to know me.
You think that's a good idea?
Yes, I do.
Miles is right.
My father says she's very well respected.
I suppose your father's a surgeon, too.
No.
My mother's a surgeon.
I've gotta get my
daughter out of day-care.
You have kids?
Just one,
which is fine with me.
But my husband's from a big family, so,
we're in negotiations.
I don't believe this.
How many pages do you read an hour?
What?
Estimate. 30 or 40 or what?
I don't know. Fifty pages. Fifty?
This is fascinating,
but I've got to go.
- Bye, Kim.
- Miles?
Well, I'm sure I read as fast as Slovak.
Laurie?
40 if I want to remember anything.Why?
This is our reading list.
We have anatomy, biochem,
histology and embryology.
That's 3,500 pages of reading each week.
This week, anyway.
And that doesn't mention
lectures and research.
I've gotta go.
I'll see you back at the room, Joe.
I have a suspicion he's
gonna be a real weak spot.
He's a hard worker.
And she's got a kid.
I want my lab group to be
the sharpest in the class.
3,500 pages.
See you later. Bye.
So, can I...
give you a lift home or something?
Am I supposed to believe...
that you're not blown away...
by all that we're facing?
What, the dead guy?
I've seen guys cut up worse than that...
Stand up and walk home.
What about the lectures,
the tests, the reading?
I've got great retention.
It's right up here on the right.
How do you get out of this thing?
You just have to squeeze.
Well, this is very nice.
Are you going to ask me up...
for a cup of tea or coffee...
or something?
Unlike you, I don't have great retention.
I have to study.
Good night.
"Good night, Joe"?
Good night, Joe.
Good night, Laurie!
This is our schedule.
We have gross lab 'til 5:00,
and dinner from 5:15 to 5:45.
We study from 5:45 to 11:45.
That gives us 15 minutes
to brush our teeth.
It takes 15 minutes to brush your teeth?
On Sundays, I give us an extra half-hour.
It takes you 15 minutes
to brush your teeth?
And floss. Do you floss?
15 minutes to brush and floss?
Or whatever you have to do.
The mitochondria inserted
within the cytoplasm...
Allow the cell to
increase absorptive area,
and to supply it with energy...
for transport of ions.
Where are the secretomotor fibers?
This is the correct placement
of the stethoscope...
in order to hear the
sound of your own heart.
You may need to unbutton
your shirts a bit.
You are the future doctors of America.
Pick a partner.
Practice on someone else.
Forget it.
Joe, no!
Introduction to clinical medicine.
It's your first contact with
real patients and real disease.
It illustrates the cellular
structure of the pancreas.
Next slide, please.
What is that smell?
Medical students.
"With the heart still in
the pericardial cavity,
insinuate your left index finger...
between the superior vena cava...
and the aorta."
Sorry.
It's test time.
92 on my biochem quiz.
95.
"Forcibly abduct both
extended lower limbs...
so that the feet are 2 to 3 feet apart.
As a result, the 2 pubic bones...
will pull apart about ten centimeters."
Sorry, Harry.
Dr. Banumbra.
Frightening.
Hi. Am I late?
You should begin dissection...
of the pelvis and perineum,
including the sexual organs.
Spend some time...
studying a cadaver of the opposite sex.
You know what?
We never did figure out what
was under Harry's stitches.
We're not supposed to do that yet.
We can't all fit around one tiny area.
I spent all last week...
looking at Miles' head
and his lovely hairdo.
You're gonna make us look
like assholes, Slovak.
Miles, god made you look like an asshole.
I just want to find out what's
under Harry's incision.
Joe.
Joe.
Yes, Laurie?
She wanted to tell you that
I'm standing next to you.
Was that it?
That's it.
Mr. Slovak,
is it clear to you,
the strict policy of this class...
is to confine your work
to the assigned part,
and to help one another...
identify the systems
in that section only?
Yes.
Then I'm confused.
I got bored.
Bored?
Yes.
I told him not to do it, Dr. Woodruff.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Mr. Slovak,
is something funny?
No.
Give me examples...
of what the internal
thoracic artery supplies...
before its terminal branches.
How many examples?
Oral quizzing makes up
20% of your lab grade.
Can you give me the examples?
The internal thoracic artery --
So you can't, right?
No. I see.
Do you think you'll be able to
give me examples tomorrow?
I bet my life on it.
Okay.
How about you, Ms. Rorbach?
Would you bet your life on it?
Yes, I think he'll be able to answer.
Good.
We're willing to bet our lives...
on Mr. Slovak's knowledge.
Tomorrow,
every member of this group...
will be graded according to Mr.
Slovak's response.
Dr. Woodruff,
could I be reassigned to another group?
Hey, Joe, look at this.
"Do petting parties in
private harm anyone?"
What?
It's a mnemonics book...
for anatomical structures.
"Do for d, diaphragmatic,
p for pleural, parties."
You might want to borrow
this for Woodruff tomorrow.
You might want to borrow this.
Dave, tomorrow's tomorrow.
Want to shoot some baskets?
I don't think Woodruff's
kidding about tomorrow.
David,
tomorrow is tomorrow.
Maybe he was hit by a truck.
That's not funny.
I think it is.
Hi.
Am I late?
Good morning.
Good morning.
Oh.
Huh?
Yesterday,
I asked you to name the
structures supplied by --
the internal thoracic artery.
They are the thymus --
you don't have to name them.
I asked you if you would
be able to name them.
You said you would. I believe you.
Today, I want you to locate
and identify the branches...
of the descending thoracic aorta.
We didn't cover those in class, did we?
You're still responsible
for the information.
It hardly seems fair --
Mr. Reed, your colleague
is trying to think.
Please.
Yes, ma'am.
Go.
The pericardial,
the...
esophageals,
the...
intercostals.
How many pairs of intercostals?
Nine.
Are you guessing?
Am I right?
Yeah.
Then I'm not guessing.
Thank you, Mr. Slovak.
Very lucky.
Yes.
Lucky for you, you mean.
Can I have a small salad...
And a mineral water?
A couple of burgers, chips, and a coke.
Classic coke.
Nice job in lab today.
It was nothing.
$3.00.
You know what I think?
I have no idea what you think.
I think you're full of it.
$5.78.
$5.78?
Can I have a fork?
Need to borrow some?
No, no.
Chips and a coke.
David.
I had to take an hour
off my sleep schedule.
I'm falling behind a little...
with semester finals starting.
I just want to stay on top of things.
Okay.
It's a 40-watt bulb.
I tried to get a 20,
but they didn't have any.
Yes.
The room only seems bright...
because it was dark before.
Yeah.
It kind of makes me mad.
I went to the student store yesterday,
and I asked for 20-watt bulbs.
They said they would have
them in this morning.
Then I went back after class,
and they didn't --
Well, since you're up --
those were great pancakes.
We lost an hour.
You gobbled them up. It was fantastic.
I like the way you eat.
We lost an hour in the lab.
We lost a half-hour...
because you brushed and flossed.
I have to brush --
Dr. Woodruff,
it's such a pleasure to --
it's such a pleasure to see you.
What a lovely dress.
Shhh.
Good morning, doctor.
I particularly enjoyed your article...
on patients' rights
versus medical realities.
Good morning.
I particularly enjoyed --
I particularly enjoyed your article...
on patients' rights versus --
What --
What are you doing?
It's really none of your business, but --
Woodruff has tea every morning...
in the faculty house.
Go ahead, laugh!
There are 140 students in the class.
How many does she remember...
when it's time to write recommendations?
I don't know. One or two?
I intend on being one of them.
Let's go.
Wait.
Come on.
I want to watch.
This should be very educational,
better than lab.
This is life.
This is...
Miles Reed.
Dr. Woodruff, what a surprise.
Good morning.
Good morning.
You're up early, Mr. Reed.
I like to work in the
lab when it's quiet.
It allows me time to concentrate.
Really? Hmm.
I understand the hospital has openings...
for a number of medical students.
As orderlies.
It's not very glamorous work.
Oh, good morning.
Good morning.
But on the other hand,
it's an opportunity to learn,
to see the knowledge we've
acquired thus far --
Can I help you, Mr. Slovak?
No.
Good.
Actually, it can be quite a challenge.
Hard work.
I agree.
Really?
Yes.
How about you?
What?
Would you like a hospital job?
I don't know.
How much does it pay?
I don't know.
Well, does it pay more than...
pulling weeds?
Washing dishes?
That sounds good to me.
Yeah?
What do I have to do?
Fill out an application
at student employment,
or I can arrange it for you.
I'll go to student employment.
You idiot.
I read one of your
articles the other day.
I particularly enjoyed the one about...
patients' rights versus
medical realities.
I've changed my mind on that topic.
But, I told myself,
you've probably given it more thought.
Dr. Richard Penn, 325.
Dr. Penn,
Dr. Richard Penn, 325 please.

a doctor-- shut up.
What's your name? Slovak, Joe.
Report to triage.
Slovak, give me a hand.
Did you come with your
thumb up your butt?
Hold the guy's ankles and help me out.
Let me go!
There you go.
Don't do anything I don't tell you to do.
Right?
Whatever you say, boss.
Okay.
My name is Banks.
Yeah. Joe Slovak. I heard.
15 hours a week?
Yeah. Full-time over Christmas.
Dedicated or poor?
Poor.
I like your shirt.
Are you following me?
I have to.
I've told everybody we're dating.
So, you see,
I have to be seen with
you outside of class,
or they'll think I'm lying.
We are going to date, aren't we?
Does "hell freezing over"
mean anything to you?
You must've been an english major.
Double major. English and pre-med.
I was a double major.
Pre-med and woodshop.
I'm wearing you down, huh?
Yeah, like a virus.
We're doing a study session...
for midterms.
Miles is organizing it.
I can't stand it.
But you're the one who doesn't study.
I study, all right.
I have my own system.
The bold type method.
You only have to study the stuff...
that's written in bold type.
That's 90% of what they test you on.
Do you want to go out tonight?
I have to do research on
my embryology project,
which means I'm doing
cell bio through dinner,
which means I have to run faster.
Have a nice day.
I hate jogging.
Now if she could only
see me play basketball.
See me run up and make a lay-up.
That's irrelevant.
I think we should know the mechanism.
What if it's on the test?
It's not important. I think it is.
Get the door.
Just remember the haldane effect.
What's that?
We're not even on that chapter.
Joe, what are you doing here?
I thought I'd take a look at group study.
Hi. Come on in.
Thanks.
Do you know what the haldane effect is?
- Yeah.
What an unexpected surprise.
Come in and have some brain food.
Thanks.
I thought you were studying.
I finished.
Finished?
I sure did.
Ask me anything you want.
Excuse me,
I was in the middle of a thought here.
As I was saying,
you can remember the conversion method --
It's not important.
It shifts the CO₂
dissociation curve up.
Yeah, she's right.
Oh, thank you.
I suppose you knew that already.
Yeah, it's right here,
in bold type.
Mommy, I love you.
Hello, Nina.
Hey, you big gobble-gobble.
Come here, baby.
Ed, could you put Nina back to bed?
I'm busy.
Sweetheart, we're trying to study.
Yeah, sure.
I'm just doing the bills.
I guess that's not as important.
Good night, mommy.
Good night, baby.
I hate to run, but it's time to go.
What?
It is kind of late.
Are we quitting?
Have I been misinformed?
Are gross anatomy exams not this Monday?
How are things here?
There never seems to be
enough time in the day...
For me or for Ed.
Anyone in your situation
would have a hard time --
No, Laurie, I'm pregnant.
Just --
About 2 months.
The timing is pretty good.
I should deliver a month after finals,
which is perfect.
It's perfect.
Come here.
Okay.
15 hours!

No.

There's no reason to hurry.

There you go.
Don't.
We could -- no.
Just don't.
Will you just stop?
Do you want a glass of water?
No, I don't.
I don't need anything. It's for hiccups.
I can take care of my own hiccups.
Joe, I'm going to explain
something to you.
I have wanted to go to med school...
Ever since I can remember.
This is not a game for me.
This has to be...
The most important thing right now.
I'm just telling you this...
So you know why I have to work so hard,
and why I can't get distracted.
Do you understand?

Okay,

It's one of the benefits of
being with a bunch of jerks.
I like that.

Joe!
Come here.
What?
Come here.
Hey.
Hi.
So how did you do?
Oh. I shouldn't have asked.
I know I did all right.
I just owe some money at the bookstore.
They're probably holding my
grades 'til I clear it up.
How did you do?
I did okay. I got through it.
You shouldn't wear clothes like this.
It makes you look pregnant.
That's the idea.
Is Ed gonna be pissed off at me?
He's gonna kill you.
Maybe I ought to take off for Mexico.
I'll meet you there.
I'll go get some pickles.
Hey, congratulations.
Doctor Woodruff?
She'll be back in a few minutes.
Find anything interesting, Mr. Slovak?
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
That's my husband.
I didn't know you were -- he died.
Get off my desk.
If this is about the bookstore,
I'm working at the hospital...
So I can pay the bookstore.
I know. I approved your application.
Would you open this for me, please?
Was David Schreiner...
taking answers off your anatomy exam?
Absolutely not.
It looked to me like he was.
Well, he wasn't.
Thank you.
Is that all?
No. Sit down.
I just don't get you, Slovak.
You scored extraordinarily
high on your entrance exams,
but your college grades...
Were just mediocre,
and we're not talking about...
A topnotch college, either.
Your first semester finals,
eighty-four.
Disappointed?
No, I'm glad I passed.
Really?
Yeah.
You could do a lot better
than that if you tried.
You know it and I know it.
What about this file...
you were showing such keen interest in...
when I walked in?
Do you think this person
would be well served...
by a doctor who just
wanted to be average?
So long as they know how to do the job.
All right.
Suppose you study it.
Give me a diagnosis.
What's in it for me?
An education.
All right, extra credit.
I don't need any extra credit.
No, you probably don't
need much of anything,
since you're so satisfied
with being average.
That's all.
I'll give it some thought.
Some call it ass-kissing,
but I call it politics.
This isn't Harvard we're graduating from.
Anybody here besides you?
I don't know. Excuse me.
We're learning the same stuff.
Hi.
Hi.
Are you a med student?
Yeah, I am.
Cool. What year?
First year.
I'm Lu.
Lu, you got a pain or something?
Yeah, in my heart.
In your heart.
Will you hold that for me?
Let's have a listen.
All right.
Oh, Lu,
sounds good to me.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, Joe.
Let's dance.
Okay.

I've gotten to know...
your answering machine pretty well.
I called you four times.
I've been doing...
some last-minute Christmas shopping.
I'd like to schedule another
appointment, doctor.
I've been experiencing
that swelling problem.
I thought we should get
together for a little therapy.
Joe, Joe.
Here we go.
One Strawberry Daiquiri,
one Long Island iced tea.
Hi.
Um, this is Jerry...
Fanning Forrester,
a friend.
Hi.
My name's a couple inches
shorter than yours.
Joe Slovak. How do you do?
Are you from around here?
No, I'm from San Francisco.
We met at Berkeley.
Holidays are the only chance
we have to get together.
Jerry's driving me home for the holidays.
Are you, um,
spending Christmas with your folks?
No, I'm working full-time over Christmas.
Earn a little money. You
know how it is, Jer.
Sure.
Guess who.
Hi.
Lu, uh,
Laurie.
Jer, meet Lu. Luann.
Hi.
Want to dance?
Nice outfit.

What do you do?
Telephone sales.
- What do you sell?
- Pens.
Ballpoint pens?
Ow!
There's a guy over there.
Is this your room?
Dave?
Dave!
I'll be right back.
Thank god.
Hey, I'm sorry.
All right?
Yeah, it's okay.
I'm just kind of upset.
My father called me this afternoon.
Is everything all right at home?
Yeah, everything's fine.
He wanted to know how I did
on my semester finals.
Did you tell him you did okay?
I mean, you did okay.
I told him,
but okay isn't good enough.
The middle of the bell-shaped curve...
isn't good enough.
What's gonna make a difference?
Do you think that taking speed
is gonna make a difference?
You stay out of my stuff.
I mean that.
You stay out...
of my things.
Hey.
Hey, what?
Screw it, man.
That's really easy for you to say,
isn't it? Isn't it?
It's no big deal to you.
It's just a game.
Hey!
Are we happening?
♪♪♪♪
Don't strain yourself, hotshot.
I hope you all had a nice holiday.
As you can see, our numbers have thinned.
But for those of you who made the cut,
I hope you're ready for an exciting...
and productive 2nd semester.
When your group is ready
to open the skull,
just ask for a chisel and saw.
A set per table.
Saw through carefully.
You don't want to damage
the dura matter...
or the brain.
Who's reading?
I am.
We make an incision...
from the vertex, all the way down...
from the lips...
to the chin.
Remember, the skin's very thin.
Go easy.
What?
I said the skin is thin. Just be careful.
You want to do this?
No.
All right.
One person dissects at a time.
It's me or it's you.
Fine.
Listen, Joe.
Hey, how's Jerry?
Joe. I bet he's a nice guy.
Maybe it's his linen pants.
Joe, stop.
Listen to me.
What?
Not that it's any of your business,
but I'm not seeing Jerry anymore.
Does Jerry know that?
Miles,
let's go the other way.
No, I want to see this.
Miles.
I only have time for one thing right now,
only one thing I can care about.
That's school.
Do you actually believe
this bullshit, or --
What are you talking about?
The way I remember it,
what happened at the motel was mutual.
It was mutual.
I never said it wasn't mutual.
I just need to sort things out.
Okay?
Yeah.
Well, you're right.
I'm sorry I don't fit into your schedule.
Joe, stop it.
The results of this test
are far from outstanding.
It's obvious to me...
that none of you studied for this test.
Is that because you think
that polycythemia,
primary polycythemia, and
relative polycythemia...
are subjects not important
enough to study?
They are just as important...
As proximal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
In fact, they are more important.
David.
So you didn't ace one.
That's no big deal.
I've flunked 3 quizzes.
I'll help you catch up.
Are you gonna do my homework...
and transcribe my immunology notes?
Are you --
Hey, David,
if it's any consolation,
I didn't pass either.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Dr. Woodruff?
Yes?
You said I could get extra
credit researching this.
Yeah.
Does the offer still stand?
Yeah.
You still have to do the research.
I've done it.
This patient has so many
things going wrong...
with so many systems.
At first I thought it was viral,
but there's not a virus
that does all this.
What about the blood work?
Maybe leukemia,
but something's off in the immune system,
with inflammation in
the kidneys and lungs.
I'm completely confused,
until I find a reference
from 4 years ago.
A recurring facial rash.
Butterfly rash.
Then it was perfectly clear to me.
What?
Lupus.
Systemic lupus erythematosus.
Ba-dum.
Okay. Prognosis?
Prognosis? I'm not a doctor.
Put it this way.
If you were this patient's doctor,
what would you say to him?
I'd say we need more tests.
Oh, bullshit.
Do you think there's more to do to him...
that hasn't already been
done and recorded?
We have a deal.
Yeah.
I did the research and got the diagnosis.
Do I get the extra credit?
Tell me what you'd say,
knowing that there's nothing
more you can do for him.
I guess I'd say, "Good-bye."
Oh.
Yeah, shit happens. Do I
get the extra credit?
Write up your research.
Leave it in my office.
It's getting late. I'm starving.
Maybe some sashimi.
That sounds pretty good.
Or tuna rolls...
with that really hot
sauce that goes with it.
That's good with some sake.
Maybe some tuna, the raw tuna.
Do you like that?
It's good stuff.
Or maybe a taco.
Slovak!
Come on!
Get his pulse!
Slovak!
Get 2 large-bore I.V.'s...
And 2 units of O-negative.
Don't touch me.
Leave me alone!
Tell X-ray to get ready.
Keep your hands off me!
Restrain that man!
Slovak, you okay?
Bring him here.
Don't touch it!
Are you ready?
1, 2, 3!
Look at this. Here it is.
This box is missing bones, too.
Every single box is missing bones.
2nd time this week.
People, in adults --
I can't believe people
are stealing bones.
...Its arterial supply.
Mister Slovak.
The, uh --
Mister Kelly.
It's related to mastication
and supplied by the buccal.
Help me.
Help!
Hey, you.
Hey!
Hey, you.
Could you help me, just for a minute?
I'll go get a nurse.
The nurses won't come.
Please. It hurts.
See, they've --
they've tied my hands down.
Could you just untie them?
Please.
All right, just for a minute.
Yeah, just for a minute.
Oh, no. Sally!
You can't take those things off!
You're gonna hurt yourself!
I'm going home.
I've got to go home!
What are you --
Someone help me!
What are you doing? Get him back down!
What's going on?
Move! excuse me.
- Is every line out?
- Looks like it.
Who unstrapped him?
I did.
I see.
You must be this patient's doctor.
No? Then get out.
There you go.
Just hold still.
Restart his I.V.
Right away, doctor.
Is that your boy, Banks?
He seems to know more than anybody else.
Let me go home!
Just let me go home!
B.P.'s one thirty over palp.
"Several small sublingual ducts...
open to the plica."
It's Dave's turn on the dissector.
Miles, leave him alone.
To find the hypoglossal nerve,
follow it backward...
From the digastric triangle in here.
The hypoglossal nerve
is closely adherent...
to the inferior ganglion of the vagus.
All right, carry on.
Good morning, everybody.
And how are you, Mr. Schreiner?
How's everything going here?
Fine.
Good.
It must be quite a strain on you...
to read a biochemistry
textbook while dissecting.
I have a quiz --
Suprarenal glands receive
arteries from 3 sources.
Would you name and locate
them for me, please?
That's material we covered from --
suprarenal glands.
Excuse me.
There are some parts of the kidneys...
that I'm not absolutely familiar with.
It's from last term.
The suprarenal -- not you, Mr. Slovak.
Continue, please, Mr. Schreiner.
The suprarenal...
glands...
Are above the kidneys,
and the arteries --
The superior suprarenal -- cut it out!
I'm asking a question that any student...
in anatomy class should
be able to answer.
Someday, Mr. Schreiner may be
standing over a real person,
and you won't be there
to give him the answers.
The suprarenal glands,
Mr. Schreiner. Go.
Excuse me.
Mr. Schreiner!
Call the health clinic.
Has he been taking anything?
What's he on?
Amphetamines.
Go get them, quick!
What'd they say?
They invited me to leave.
They can't throw you out.
I talked to a counselor -- listen.
They invited me to leave.
So that's it.
I'll see you.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Hey,
tomorrow's tomorrow.
Do you have any idea what
you've done to him?
Dean Torrence, this is Joe Slovak,
David Schreiner's roommate.
Do you have any idea what
you've done to him?
It's all right.
We acted in Mr. Schreiner's
best interests.
He's human, not superhuman.
He did what he thought he had to do.
He wanted to be a doctor
more than anything else.
The fact is, Mr. Slovak,
wanting to be a doctor...
doesn't mean one should be a doctor.
Oh.
And who decides who should...
and shouldn't be a doctor? You?
Yes.
Yeah.
And you're always right, aren't you?
I'm not quite clear...
how this concerns you,
but I do know you owe Dr.
Woodruff an apology.
No, it's okay.
No, he will apologize.
Are you going to invite me to leave?
Huh?
Don't bother. I left 5 minutes ago.
Please consider what you're doing.
I already have.
Rachel,
can I talk with you for a minute?
Uh,
yeah, sure.
You should go find out
what happened to him.
He doesn't say --
he goes for weeks without talking to me.
In difficult situations,
he always talks to you.
You're wonderful at times like this.
Let's drop it.
Your mother wants me to ask you...
what happened.
I told her you'll tell
us when you're ready.
You ready?
No.
He's not ready.
Where were we?
Right here on the zygomatic arch.
He's only been gone for 12 days.
What?
If he came back now, he could catch up.
What do you want me to do about it?
I can't do anything about it, Kim.
Hi.
Hi.
I just met your parents.
They seem like nice people.
Yeah, I like them.
If you want to watch,
stand on the side.
Give me the ball.
Afraid to play with the girls?
Mr. Macho,
Mr. "Everything's a breeze."
Who's the first one to quit
when things get rough?
Don't psychoanalyze me.
I'm sorry!
Can I ask you something?
Do I have a choice?
What are you afraid of? Woodruff?
She's not in class anymore.
She doesn't bother me.
Then what? All the work you missed?
We'll help you catch up.
Just ask for help. Admit you need help.
Can I ask you something?
What?
Did you come down here
to give me a hard time?
No.
When you first came to class,
I thought,
"he is gonna leave us in the dust."
You thought I was a jerk.
Yeah, I did.
Joe -- listen.
Listen.
No, you listen.
The truth --
the truth is,
I don't really care about medicine.
Why should anybody put
up with all the work...
unless they really do?
You do. Miles does.
I don't.
Okay, there.
You wanted me to admit something.
Okay. I admit that.
I'd better go.
Thanks.
Thanks for coming down.
I mean it.
I'll talk to you after finals.
I'll be pretty busy 'til then.
What happened to Woodruff?
She's in the hospital.
Maybe one of her old students
will get a hold of her.
It's pretty serious. She has uremia.
Kidney failure?
What caused that?
I don't know.
The rumors say lupus.
I have to go.
Dr. Woodruff? She's in the back.
Excuse me,
there's someone here to see you.
Well, Joe Slovak.
How are you doing?
Thanks, Marie.
Put that right there. All right.
Take that one.
Thank you.
Pretty gorgeous, huh?
The, uh --
Son of a bitch.
The inflammation's spread all over.
I heard you were in the hospital.
I'm going back tonight.
I just needed...
to take care of a few things.
Look at that. A self-portrait.
I was just a little pretentious...
when I was your age.
You should have told me
that was your file. Why?
What difference does it make?
It's still a person's file.
But it was your file.
Were you trying to make me feel like an ass?
Did I?
Remember that feeling.
Those files represent real
people with real feelings.
I was a good student.
Why?
You're crazy.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe it wasn't completely fair.
Oh, god, I don't know.
I've just worked so hard...
for so many years,
trying to turn my best students...
into perfect doctors.
I'd fill them with information,
and drill them,
and hone their skills.
You said something in the Dean's office.
I said a lot of things
in the Dean's office.
About how we expect you...
to be more than human.
Remember?
Well, to be more than human in some ways,
and less in others.
And now,
now I wonder about some of these...
brilliant doctors of mine,
with their minds for medicine
and their hearts for what?
Real estate?
You know, I wonder...
what they'd say to some lonely,
terrified patient,
who grabs their hand and says,
"Can you explain this to me?
Can you help me accept this?
Can you sit with me...
So I don't feel so alone?"
I bet they don't say anything,
because I didn't teach them to.
It's not your responsibility.
Then whose is it?
I made doctors, Slovak.
People need healers. Do you understand?
Yeah, I guess.
So, um,
are you going back to school?
I, uh,
I don't know.
The Dean said it would
be all right if you did.
No.
Oh, shit.
Slovak,
you and I have so much in common.
You know that?
We're both too smart for our own good.
Look, I'm gonna go.
I think you should go. Get out of here.
What do you want from me?
What!
I want you to be...
more than you've ever
wanted to be yourself,
and I can't tell you how to be it.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.okay.
I'm really sorry.
Did you take our leg? Vheck the psycho brothers.
They always take limbs.
That's not it! It's right there.
It doesn't look -- shhh.
It's right there!
Hi. Am I late?
Miles, what have you done to Harry?
He's a mess.
Slovak.
Mr. Slovak's presence...
Could quite possibly
hinder you at this point.
Are you willing to allow him back?
Yes.
All right, fine.
"A-V bundles from branches of
the right coronary artery,
"the bundle branches
from the left coronary,
except for the posterior
limb of the left bundle --"
Kim, where are you? It's from October.
What?
Notes from October.
"Name the A-V valves that
separate the atria...
from the ventricles in the heart."
Let's see.
That would be the tricuspid valve --
Next.
Look at this.
No!
You have 30 seconds...
to name the structure and function.
Ready?
Go.
Stomach.
Ed. When did I call him?
An hour ago.
My 30 seconds hasn't started.
What did he say?
Burnt dinner. Sent out for pizza.
20 seconds!
Miles!
Hey, wait a second. Wait a minute.
What exam are we working on?
We are working on --
anatomy! Anatomy!
I can't believe I forgot
the word "anatomy."
I forgot the word "anatomy"!
We have 3 more years of this bullshit,
then 4 more years of residency.
I'm gonna be 30 years old
by the time I'm a doctor!
And look at me!
Look at my skin. It's ruined!
And I smell,
and you guys smell!
I'm sick of being around
people who smell!
You guys.
What!
- Relax!
- That's brilliant, Miles.
Relax, Kim! Calm down, everyone.
We have time.
How long were you in labor with Nina?
45 minutes.
I don't want to have my baby in here.
You won't have your baby in here.
How do you open this thing?
Nobody's moving anywhere.
They're checking everybody's papers.
A phone. Emergency!
Linens or a tablecloth?
What's going on?
Come on. What?
I'm having a baby. I'm not crippled.
Oh, my god. Put me down!
Right here!
Over here!
Careful. Put this under your head.
I need to boil water.
Is she having a kid here?
No, no. I'm out of here.
The best place for this baby...
Is right where he's at.
Are you okay?
Go put something else on the jukebox.
Are you okay?
No.
Check your watch. Here comes another one.
Breathe, Kim. Don't push.
2 minutes apart.
2 minutes?
That's bad, right?
We're close.
Paramedics in 10 minutes.
Focus, focus.
Are you okay?
Mm-hmm.
Good. I think she's gonna be okay.
You guys, I'm gonna have the baby now.
Miles, give me your shirt.
What? This is silk.
All right? On my next contraction.
I'll be outside.
You're gonna be there, right?
Next contraction.
Okay. Now push.
Push!
Come on, Kim!
His head's out!
Is it a boy or girl?
I can't tell by his ears.
Push, Kim!
Kim, another big push.
Another big push!
I'm gonna pull his shoulders out.
Ready? Push, push!
That a girl!
There we go!
Oh!
Look at that.
We got a girl here, Kim!
Look at that.
Aww.
This is the 8:30 A.M...
gross human anatomy final.
If your card says...
anything other than 8:30 A.M.,
you are in the wrong place.
That's wrong. It's 8:31.
You're wrong.
- We'll be late!
- So what?
We have a good excuse.
Eyes forward...
Before the examination.
Wait!
You're late. We have an excuse.
Is it a good one?
Yes, yes.
It's a very good one.
Come on.
Dr. Banumbra,
can you get a note to Dr. Woodruff?
I suggest you concentrate on your finals.
Yeah, sure. It's just that...
Something wonderful
happened last night --
We'll discuss it later.
Come on.
Come on.
Please remain until your
examinations are collected.
I'd like to congratulate
each and every one of you...
on completing your first year.
However,
before you go,
a brief announcement.
Dr. Rachel Woodruff...
Passed away...
At Holy Oak hospital...
yesterday.
Heart failure,
related to a condition she had.
She wished the very best for you.
She expected...
the very best from you.
Yes! 85 percentile!
Oh, yes, yes!
Whoo!
How'd you do? 85 percentile.
What'd you do?
87.
That's great.
Kim, Kim!
Excuse me.
Hey, guys.
Look at this. Koochie, koochie.
They say I can make up
the exams this summer.
- That's fantastic.
- But no summer vacation.
We've got to get going.
Okay.
Okay. Bye, baby.
I'm 85th percentile. What are you?
Huh? 90.
Thanks for everything.
Oh, certainly.
So you are gonna make it up this summer?
Yes, I am.
Bye.
I'm gonna try.
You still owe me for that silk shirt.
Nah.
Where's Slovak? I bet I beat him.
If you need something
to do, take a vacation.
I don't want a vacation. Then go fishing.
I don't like fishing.
How'd you do on your finals?
I'm about to find out.
Could I have my job back?
Dedicated or poor?
Dedicated.
And poor.
I'll see what I can do.
But your grades better be there.
Oh, yeah. Sure.
My grades.
Hi.
Lose something?
Uh, hi.
Yeah.
I was just reading this article.
I wrote down your grades here,
just in case you were interested,
but I can see that you aren't.
So, I'll just...
Throw them away.
I thought you weren't interested.
I'm not.
That's obvious.
Since you wrote them down,
what'd I get?
Tell me what I got.
Uh-uh.
What did I get?
87 and 96.
I bet I did better than you, right?
On the written,
but I beat your pants
off on the practical.
I've got to go fill out
some forms for next fall.
I've got to go, too.
Hey, I'll uh...
See you next year.
Laurie!
