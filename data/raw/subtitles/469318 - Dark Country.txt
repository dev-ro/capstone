 This is your wakeup call. At the tone...
 Oh, God, you should've known.
 You don't remember how it started, but you
 could've guessed how it was all gonna end.
 She was a dealer, right?
 Blackjack? Or was it poker?
 Doesn't really matter now, does it?
 Now, it's all over and done with.
 You woke up with the prettiest girl
 you've ever seen lying in your bed,
 cheap ring around her finger,
 and a $50 receipt from the little white chapel
 crumpled up on the floor.
 You don't even know how to spell her name,
 but it doesn't matter.
 You only know you love her and it's real
 and you'd do anything for her.
 Sucker.
 Go on, look at yourself.
 Ifyou knew then what you know now,
 would it make any difference?
 Do you think you could save her?
 Do you think you could save yourself?
 Wake up, sIeepy head.
 Not exactIy four-star room service,
 but we aim to pIease.
 That's so sweet.
 -I didn't exactIy marry you for money.
 -That was your first mistake.
 That was it right there. Did you feeI that?
 -What?
 -The moment.
 -What moment?
 -The moment I've been Iooking for.
 Ever since... Ever since I quit my job
 and cIeaned out my bank account,
 hit the road, I've been waiting.
 I've just been... No, Ionger than that.
 When I was 16 years oId,
 I saw a girI on a train,
 pIatinum-bIond hair, beautifuI.
 AII I wanted to do was take her away
 to Iive with me for the rest of my Iife.
 But you know what?
 I couIdn't even say heIIo.
 I foIIowed her out of the station.
 She went one way and I went the other,
 and ever since then I've been...
 I've been waiting for...
 Waiting, waiting.
 Just goes to show you, you know?
 Anything can happen.
 -Anything.
 -Anything.
 -Come on.
 -Thank you.
 We got a Iong hauI ahead of us.
 I'm stiII tired.
 You can sIeep in the car.
 I'II grab some coffee.
 Pretty, isn't she?
 HeII of a worId.
 Yeah, it's a shame.
 -So, driving across the desert tonight?
 -Yeah.
 -Vacation?
 -I wouIdn't...
 -Or just married?
 -Yeah.
 -CongratuIations.
 -Thank you.
 CarefuI on those roads tonight, son.
 PeopIe get Iost out there
 and never heard from again.
 Just ask her and her boyfriend.
 Time gets sIippery out there,
 roads dead end, things doubIe back.
 -Just stay on 95. It'II take you aII the way.
 -Thanks for the tip.
 And take care of that new wife of yours.
 Here you go, doII.
 -Thanks.
 -You betcha.
 AII right.
 Let's get out of here.
 Weirdoes are taking over.
 -What?
 -Nothing.
 Let's hit it.
 One Iast Iook.
 You've done this before, right?
 -Driven across the desert at night?
 -It's the onIy way to beat the heat.
 Why did you stop?
 The sign back there...
 You got a map in here?
 Yeah.
 Thank you.
 Let's see here.
 First we went here, and then we went there...
 -Hey, hey.
 -...got us Iost,
 and then we ended up here.
 -We're supposed to be on the 93.
 -So?
 We're on the 95.
 That's not so bad, onIy two off.
 You're not one of those never-make-
 the-wrong-turn kind of guys, are you?
 I never turned.
 Must have been on the 95
 the whoIe time. Shit.
 Good thing we're not on a scheduIe.
 Pay attention to the road this time, Ioser.
 You're the navigator.
 -This is what happens when you faII asIeep.
 -Try to figure it out.
 AII right, anything but country.
 What if I Iike country?
 WeII, then I guess we have our first tussIe
 there, IittIe Iady.
 Good thing we're on our honeymoon.
 Come on. I paid a grand for this thing.
 -I Iike this car.
 -WeII, you get what you pay for.
 -Is that better?
 -That's much better.
 OId man.
 AII right, I'm turning now.
 You're my witness.
 OnIy 22 miIes off. Not so bad.
 Do you think we're crazy?
 Great. You're having second thoughts.
 It's... What time is it?
 OnIy about your sense of direction.
 No. It's just, I'm not an impuIsive person.
 Hey, I'm just thriIIed I'm sober
 and you're stiII pretty.
 Jerk.
 You better turn out to be a nice guy
 or I'II kick your ass.
 That's a IoveIy thing to say to your husband.
 -Our first day as man and wife.
 -If you haven't noticed, it's night.
 You know, I'm not a big fan of that.
 No? You didn't seem to have a probIem
 with it Iast night.
 Last night?
 -You couId've shot me in the head...
 -WeII, I'II quit...
 ...I wouIdn't have noticed Iast night.
 ...tomorrow or when we have kids anyhow.
 You do want kids, don't you?
 I toId you, I'm oId-fashioned.
 Kids, dog, house,
 white picket fence, the works.
 Why don't we start smaII?
 Maybe a IittIe apartment,
 a coupIe of housepIants, cat.
 -A cat? You a cat person?
 -Sure. No. I Iove pussies.
 -Don't.
 -Cats.
 You feeI that? It's so hot.
 It's Iike an oven outside, it's so hot.
 -ShouId've changed out of this dress.
 -No, I Iike it.
 Yeah.
 -You mean you Iike how my tits Iook in it.
 -That, too.
 I'm sweaty, hot.
 WeII, have a drink.
 There's some water in the cooIer.
 It's a good idea.
 Even better.
 Jesus. OId-fashioned?
 BeautifuI.
 Sweet Jesus.
 What's this?
 How come I never saw that before?
 Chinese. It means trust.
 -I Iove the Chinese.
 -Me, too.
 Chinese food, Chinese checkers.
 PuII over. PuII over. Turn off the Iights.
 Oh, shit.
 -What was that?
 -Heat Iightning.
 PIanning on driving aII the way
 to Sedona Iike this?
 You don't reaIize how much Iight
 the stars give out.
 AII the same, Iet's stick with the Iights.
 -You aII right?
 -God, you hit him. Oh, God.
 -Shit.
 -You hit him.
 No, I didn't. I missed him.
 -Fuck.
 -What?
 God, you hit him.
 AII right. Stay in the car.
 My God.
 No other car.
 CaII 91 1 .
 Oh, God.
 There's no service.
 Okay, I need your heIp. Hurry.
 Oh, God.
 You get the feet and I'II get the head.
 No, no, no, maybe we shouIdn't move him.
 What are we gonna do?
 We can't just Ieave him here.
 -Just go easy.
 -What do I...
 Just grab his... Yeah. God... Oh, God.
 For God's sake.
 -Okay, get the door.
 -Okay. Okay.
 -Okay.
 -Okay.
 Wait. ShouIdn't you check the other car?
 Right.
 No one eIse.
 He must have faIIen asIeep
 at the wheeI or something.
 Yeah.
 This goddamn ceII phone. Work.
 Jesus, bIood aII over my hands.
 -What are we gonna do?
 -AImost to the 93.
 There's gonna be a gas station.
 There's gonna be a rest area, something.
 Keep trying that ceII.
 Oh, God, what happened to the road?
 It's a dead end?
 Where are we?
 Shit. Where are we? Jesus.
 Great.
 -We're Iost, aren't we?
 -We're not Iost.
 There are pIants growing
 in the middIe of the road.
 Okay, we're just gonna turn around,
 that's aII.
 We're just gonna backtrack to 95. We're fine.
 MeanwhiIe we have a stranger bIeeding
 to death in the back of our car.
 We don't know how bad that man is hurt.
 Are you kidding me?
 He doesn't have a fucking face.
 You think panicking heIps?
 It'II be aII right.
 Take a deep breath, caIm down. AII right?
 Now just put some music on or something.
 Okay.
 Why don't you just try AM?
 It's okay.
 We're in a shadow zone, that's aII.
 The desert has these pockets...
 -Dead zones, where...
 -Dead zones?
 Nice!
 Hey, don't worry. We're gonna get heIp.
 It'II be fine.
 -How?
 -What?
 How are we going to get heIp if
 we don't even know where the fuck we are?
 Look around. Do you see a Iight?
 Do you? No! How couId you get us Iost?
 We're not Iost. Goddamn road has
 to Iead somewhere, doesn't it?
 Just keep trying your ceII.
 Doesn't find... There's nothing.
 Jesus Christ.
 Hey, wasn't this where we found him?
 Must have passed it aIready. There's no car.
 -See if he's stiII breathing.
 -No way.
 No.
 He's stiII got a puIse, but it's weak.
 He's Iost a Iot of bIood. Fuck.
 It's your fauIt, you know.
 You're the one who's driving.
 You shouId know where we're going.
 Hey, somebody messed with the road signs
 or something.
 -Right.
 -Something.
 I'm teIIing you. I didn't make a wrong turn.
 -Jesus.
 -So what if I did?
 This guy wouId be dead by now
 if we hadn't come aIong.
 Is this how you handIe stress?
 Just go on the attack?
 We're Iost in the desert
 in the middIe of the fucking night.
 This guy is gonna die
 if we don't get him heIp.
 Thank you for the support.
 AII the same.
 AII? What's that supposed to mean, aII?
 Who aII? Not the first impuIse you've made
 on this IittIe drive?
 No!
 Hey, buddy. You've been in an accident.
 We're getting you heIp.
 -Oh, God. What... What is this?
 -It's gonna be aII right.
 We found you on the side of the road.
 You've been in a bad accident.
 What the heII is this?
 Just try to Iie back down.
 We'II be there soon.
 -Are you okay?
 -Oh, God!
 -Take it easy, buddy. It's aII right.
 -No, no. This isn't happening. No.
 -What?
 -Stop the car.
 -I gotta get out.
 -You're hurt pretty bad.
 -Let me out! Stop the car!
 -Take it easy. Come on.
 -We're trying to get you heIp.
 -Stop the fucking car!
 Hey! Hey! You're in shock.
 -Where's the highway?
 -You've been in a bad accident.
 Where's the highway?
 Just try to breathe.
 -Where's the highway?
 -AImost there.
 -You two are Iost, aren't you?
 -No, we're not Iost. We're fine.
 Highway's just right up ahead.
 Did you see anybody eIse back there?
 -You mean in the car?
 -On the road!
 Did you pass anyone?
 We haven't seen anyone on this road
 except for you.
 This is a fucking nightmare.
 Just hang in there, buddy.
 We're getting you heIp fast as we can.
 We're gonna get you to a hospitaI.
 -Okay?
 -I don't think we're gonna make it.
 Lie back down. Try to reIax.
 I think I need a cigarette.
 Might not be such a great idea.
 Cigarette.
 Light.
 I wouIdn't move around too much
 if I were you.
 Get away from him.
 Excuse me, you okay?
 Look, if you're in some kind of troubIe...
 It's fine, you don't have to taIk.
 You'd Iike that, wouIdn't you,
 if I just kept my mouth shut?
 -Dick.
 -Hey, take it easy.
 You don't have any fucking idea
 of what's going on here, do you?
 Man, we're just trying to... Wait a minute.
 What did you say?
 Do I know you?
 What do you mean?
 My name, you said my name. Dick.
 Richard, actuaIIy.
 You Iook Iike a Dick.
 Hey, paI, we're just trying to heIp you here.
 You know?
 -Yeah, don't mind me. I'm deIirious.
 -Jesus Christ.
 Okay, Dick, I got a IittIe question for you.
 You ready?
 -You ever been to Cheetahs?
 -Cheetahs? What's that?
 A IittIe strip cIub, downtown Vegas.
 -Can't say that I have.
 -That's too bad, you know.
 It's a nice pIace. There are good girIs there.
 Who are you taIking about?
 They're just doing
 what they have to do to survive. Right?
 Hey, paI, what're you saying?
 You trying to freak us out?
 I'm sorry. I don't want to upset you.
 It's just... It's been a IittIe bit
 of a rough night, you know?
 For aII of us.
 AII right, buddy, aII right.
 Hey, you better teII us
 what happened back there, huh?
 Have you ever been murdered before?
 Buddy, what the fuck is your probIem?
 -Sorry, Dick...
 -It's Richard.
 Look, we're trying to be good peopIe here.
 But if you're gonna be a nutcase,
 I'II kick you back out on that road.
 I don't give a damn how bad you're hurt.
 You got it?
 I'm sorry.
 You do something we shouId know about?
 Somebody after you?
 -No.
 -You in some kind of troubIe?
 Let's just drive.
 -I'm just scared.
 -Let's just get him where he needs to go.
 -Don't...
 -Let's get out of here.
 -Don't Ieave me.
 -Let's go.
 Oh, yeah.
 AII right.
 AII right.
 Let's get you to a hospitaI.
 Is that the freeway?
 Thank God.
 We're there.
 OnIy way out.
 We're gonna get you heIp, buddy.
 One way out.
 And I didn't ever want to hurt you.
 Get off of him, motherfucker!
 Stop it. Stop it.
 He tried to kiII me.
 You saw, he attacked me.
 ''OnIy way out.'' What does that mean?
 I don't know.
 The fucking guy is obviousIy crazy.
 He tried to kiII you. He tried to kiII you.
 Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do?
 Go to the poIice. TeII them what happened.
 We were...
 I picked him up, tried to heIp him.
 He attacked me. I didn't have a choice.
 It was... It was seIf-defense.
 SeIf-defense? Look at him.
 You think they're reaIIy gonna beIieve that?
 Does that Iook Iike seIf-defense to you?
 No. No!
 We picked him up just Iike it happened,
 and he died on the way to get heIp.
 Look...
 Look, I'm not an expert
 on poIice forensics or anything,
 but I don't think it's gonna take a genius
 to figure out what happened here,
 you know, especiaIIy since
 I'm wearing most of his brains.
 Let's just Ieave him. Let's Ieave him.
 Let's get the fuck out of here.
 You reaIize what this wiII do?
 We Ieave him here, we're tied to this.
 Our Iives are over.
 You know that, don't you?
 If they don't beIieve us.
 WeII, Iet's just take him on our honeymoon.
 ''Pardon me,
 do you have a vaIet for our Iuggage?
 ''And don't mind the dead body.''
 This isn't happening. This isn't happening.
 This can't be happening.
 We'II bury him.
 Bury him.
 Out there with the scorpions and the snakes,
 no one wiII ever find him.
 No one. Ever.
 Yeah.
 He knew your name.
 How'd he know your name?
 Satisfied?
 This is crazy, but I'm gonna ask.
 You didn't know that guy from somewhere,
 did you?
 -What are you taIking about?
 -I don't know.
 Vegas or something.
 I've never seen that fucking guy
 in my Iife before.
 -Don't know him. Never met him.
 -Okay, forget it.
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
 Hey. Hey.
 Remember this?
 Yeah.
 -He's stiII aIive.
 -He's dead.
 He's...
 -He's not...
 -Listen. Just Iisten.
 You heard it.
 -I heard something.
 -What if he's aIive?
 What are you gonna do?
 I don't know.
 He couId taIk. He couId Iie.
 He couId say that you attacked him.
 Fuck.
 -This far enough?
 -No. Keep going.
 If I gotta do this by myseIf,
 we're gonna be out here aII night.
 Okay.
 -You ready?
 -Yeah.
 We're not being smart about this.
 -They aIways find the body.
 -They're not going to find this body.
 How can you be sure?
 What if an animaI digs it up?
 Let's hope it's hungry.
 Jesus.
 Maybe you shouId just turn yourseIf in.
 WeII, you're the one who kiIIed him.
 It's just...
 Let's get something straight.
 We're in this together,
 for better or for worse, remember?
 I'm sure this is what they had in mind.
 Look, we're gonna get through this.
 We're gonna bury this fucker,
 get back in the car,
 drive away and forget it ever happened.
 We're going to get to Sedona,
 fuck our brains out,
 and then we're going to figure out
 what to do for the rest of our Iives.
 -You got it?
 -Yeah.
 Good. Keep digging.
 -Fuck.
 -Fuck.
 Damn it. We gotta make it Ionger.
 -Can't we just make him shorter?
 -Shorter?
 Yeah. Can't you just, I don't know,
 cut his head off?
 Don't Iook at me Iike that. You had
 no probIem bashing his fucking brains in.
 Cover him up.
 That side, over there.
 HeII of a honeymoon, huh?
 Shit!
 Oh, shit.
 PIease, pIease, God.
 Let's get the heII out of here.
 WeII, that's the Iast time I cross the desert
 without a gun.
 Have you ever used a gun?
 I hate guns.
 I guess this one doesn't count, huh?
 -You went through my fucking purse?
 -I'm aIIowed. I'm your husband, remember?
 I was going to teII you about the gun,
 about everything once we were in Sedona,
 once we were safe.
 Safe? From what?
 Not what, who.
 I bought that gun from a friend
 for protection.
 What are you teIIing me?
 Remember that I toId you
 I had been working at the Hard Rock?
 Yeah.
 WeII, I haven't aIways been a deaIer.
 When I first got to town three years ago,
 I didn't have a nickeI to my name,
 and I had to eat.
 You know, I was just doing
 what I had to do to survive.
 There were a Iot of girIs in the same boat,
 nice girIs,
 and some of them danced at this IittIe cIub
 on the strip,
 and they aIways had money.
 One night, I just went aIong out of curiosity.
 It was a Iot easier than I thought.
 Let me guess, Cheetahs.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Fuck.
 Fuck.
 He... There was this one guy,
 reaI creepy.
 He used to come in every night
 and became a IittIe fixated on me.
 You mean you fucked him?
 No. No, I didn't fuck him.
 I didn't fuck anybody.
 So, was he the one, this creep?
 -Is he?
 -I don't know.
 You don't know? WeII, was he or wasn't he?
 -Maybe.
 -Maybe?
 I don't know, maybe. It's hard to teII
 when a guy doesn't have a face.
 Jesus.
 Something happened when
 we were at the diner before we Ieft town.
 Pretty, isn't she?
 Take care of that new wife of yours.
 And you didn't tell me?
 -WeII, I thought he was a fucking nutcase.
 -He is a fucking nutcase. That's my point.
 -Was it him? Was it the same guy?
 -I don't know.
 I don't know.
 Doesn't reaIIy matter now anyway, does it?
 What matters is it's over and done with.
 -Yeah.
 -Are you okay?
 I mean, are we okay?
 I'm not using you.
 I'm not.
 AII right. We're gonna go get cIeaned up.
 We're gonna find out where the fuck we are,
 and we're gonna get back
 on the main highway, aII right?
 Yeah.
 Sorry.
 Where are my shorts?
 Here.
 -You ready?
 -Yeah.
 Okay, Iet's go.
 -What?
 -We gotta go back.
 -What?
 -My watch.
 I Iost my fucking watch.
 -Who cares? Just Ieave it.
 -I can't.
 -My name...
 -Why not?
 My name is engraved
 on the back of the watch.
 I know.
 -Stupid.
 -Yeah.
 I don't see anything eIse we can do.
 I mean, fuck,
 you think I want to go back there?
 Look, babe, if we don't stick together
 on this, we're done for.
 Done for? We're aIready done for.
 Gina, what are you doing?
 -What are you doing?
 -What does it Iook Iike I'm doing?
 What, are you waIking... Fuck.
 What are you... You're Ieaving?
 -What, are you gonna waIk back to Vegas?
 -If I have to.
 Hey. Hey!
 -Hey, hey, hey, hey.
 -Don't touch me.
 -Come here, come here, come here.
 -Get off... Just give me my shit.
 WaIking out after what you've puIIed?
 Where are you going?
 You teII me what's going on right now.
 I puIIed?
 Wanna teII me what's going on here now?
 -What are you taIking about?
 -Who is he?
 Your boyfriend? Did you owe him money?
 I mean, what is it? Just teII me. What?
 -You're crazy.
 -I just wanna know
 what you're getting me into here.
 -Me?
 -Yeah.
 We wouIdn't be in this fucking mess
 if it weren't for you.
 You know, you're right. I'd be haIfway
 to Sedona now with my new wife.
 You know? The one with the gun
 in her purse
 who fIaunts her pussy in other men's faces.
 You fucking asshoIe. Fucking asshoIe.
 Keep your voice down.
 Hey, keep your voice down.
 -I don't...
 -Quiet.
 -There's peopIe sIeeping in these cars.
 -I don't give a shit.
 -You kiIIed him, not me.
 -Shut the fuck up.
 I knew this was a bad idea.
 I don't know what I was thinking.
 I don't even know you.
 -Gina.
 -We're Iost in the middIe of nowhere.
 We've been attacked by a fucking psycho,
 I watch you commit murder
 and heIp you bury a body
 on the first day of our fucking marriage.
 -This is not how it's supposed to be.
 -AII right.
 Gina...
 I think it's best
 if we just forget the whoIe thing,
 if we just pretend we never met.
 Fine. WaIk away.
 Why don't you just go to the poIice
 whiIe you're at it?
 Make up any story you want.
 I'm sure they're gonna beIieve
 an oId-fashioned girI Iike you.
 Why did you Iie to me?
 Why did you Iie?
 Gina, Iook, I know I...
 Things happened fast between us
 and we had a pIan, you know.
 Start a new Iife together.
 WeII, I stiII want that Iife.
 So, you gotta decide right here, right now,
 what do you want?
 Don't make me go back there.
 I can't go back there, pIease.
 Just don't make me go back.
 -Don't make me go, pIease. I can't go back.
 -Okay. Okay.
 -PIease.
 -Okay. Okay.
 You can stay here.
 You're gonna be in the Iights.
 -Wait for me.
 -Okay. Yeah.
 Here.
 Here, take it.
 Don't move from this spot.
 Don't taIk to anyone. Just stay in the Iight.
 I won't be Iong.
 We'II get out of this.
 Whatever happened back in Vegas
 doesn't matter because I Iove you.
 I know I Iove you. I knew it
 from the moment I Iaid eyes on you.
 -I'II be right back.
 -Promise?
 Promise.
 Come on, where are you?
 You didn't know that guy from somewhere?
 I've never seen that fucking guy
 in my life before.
 -You ever been to Cheetahs?
 -Don't know him. Never met him.
 And I didn't ever want to hurt you.
 Okay.
 What the heII...
 No.
 No. No. No, no, no, no.
 No! I kiIIed you!
 You were dead!
 I kiIIed you!
 Gina!
 Gina.
 Gina.
 Gina!
 Gina!
 Gina!
 Gina!
 Gina!
 Gina!
 No. No. No.
 No. No. No. No.
 It's not her ring. It's not my wife.
 -Stay where you are.
 -HeIp me.
 PIease, it's my wife.
 Stay where you are.
 You don't understand. She's missing.
 -Don't move.
 -She's missing.
 Don't move!
 Put your hands where I can see them.
 You gotta heIp me find her, pIease.
 -Sir, you have some identification?
 -Yeah. Yeah. Here.
 Wait here.
 Wait.
 What's this you were saying
 about your wife?
 My wife, she's out there somewhere.
 Now, I found these tracks, right?
 But they weren't hers.
 -Oh, God.
 -AII right now, caIm down.
 Let's just start from the beginning...
 I don't have any time.
 Something couId happen to her.
 Sir, I can't heIp you
 if I don't know what happened.
 Look, we were driving to Sedona, aII right?
 My wife and I just got married.
 We were in Vegas.
 -It's not Iike that. We're in Iove.
 -WeII, of course you are.
 So, we stopped at that rest area
 a coupIe of miIes back down the road,
 and I went to the bathroom,
 and I came out, and she was gone.
 I Iooked everywhere.
 We picked up this guy.
 We were trying to heIp him,
 but I think he took my wife
 because I found tracks
 Ieading off into the desert, right?
 And I foIIowed them, and they Ied
 to a grave, and I dug around,
 and I uncovered a hand, a woman's hand.
 She was just buried out there in the desert.
 But it wasn't her, not my wife.
 I don't know.
 It's Iike he's fucking with me or something.
 So, I panicked. I ran back, got in the car,
 drove somewhere, anywhere to find heIp.
 That's when you came aIong.
 That's one heII of a story.
 -Can we go find my fucking wife?
 -AII right, now caIm down.
 -CaIm down? He couId have her.
 -You say you found a woman...
 He's obviousIy kiIIed that other woman.
 -...but it wasn't your wife.
 -No!
 AII right, then why don't we just
 go back to the rest area?
 Fine.
 You're gonna Ieave your car here
 and ride with me.
 Front seat's a IittIe crammed up.
 Why don't you just go ahead
 and cIimb on in the back?
 Don't worry, paI. We'II find your wife.
 Your wife, has she got any enemies?
 Anybody wanna hurt her?
 No. Not that I know of.
 The reason I ask
 is peopIe tend to marry in Vegas
 for a Iot of reasons, good and bad.
 Just toId you it's not Iike that.
 No, no,
 I remember you said you were in Iove.
 StiII, I've never been much of a beIiever
 in that Iove-at-first-sight stuff.
 Maybe... Maybe that's why I never married.
 I've seen stuff out here
 I wouIdn't confess to a priest.
 Yeah, I bet.
 We caII this part of the desert
 the garbage dump,
 onIy the garbage is human. Murder victims.
 Mob hits mostIy, but other stuff, too,
 you know.
 That body you found, doIIar to donuts,
 I bet you that Ieads right back to Vegas.
 We see it aII out here, man.
 Prostitutes, strippers, gambIing debts.
 -Your wife into any of that crap?
 -No!
 I aIready toId you.
 What the heII is this, for Christ's sakes?
 Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
 I gotta ask, you know.
 Leave no turn unstoned.
 Hey, maybe she just got coId feet,
 you know, about the marriage.
 -I've seen that before.
 -What about that rest area?
 -Thompson, do you copy?
 -Yeah, this is Thompson. Go ahead.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 -Okay, I'II be right there.

 This is your wakeup call. At the tone...
 Wake up, sleepy head.
 That was your first mistake.
 That was it right there. Did you feel that?
 -What?
 -The moment.
 -What moment?
 -The moment I've been looking for.
 Ever since... Ever since I quit myjob
 and cleaned out my bank account,
 hit the road, I've been waiting.
 I'vejust been... No, longer than that.
 When I was 16 years old,
 I saw a girl on a train,
 platinum-blond hair, beautiful.
 All I wanted to do was take her away
 to live with me for the rest of my life.
 But you know what?
 I couldn't even say hello.
 I followed her out of the station.
 She went one way and I went the other,
 and ever since then I've been...
 I've been waiting for...
 Waiting.
 Just goes to show you, you know?
 Anything can happen.
 -Anything.
 -Anything.
