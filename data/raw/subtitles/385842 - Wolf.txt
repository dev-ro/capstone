WOLF
I'm ETA.
Inside.
Don't turn the light off!
What is it?
It's all right.
How many people are here?
My wife.
-My God!
-Sit down!
Sit down, both of you!
Till I tell you to get up.
What did I say?
Sit down!
My God!
Where's the phone?
The phone!
This is an answering machine.
Leave your message
after the tone.
This is Wolf.
What the hell's happened?
Get me out of here, dammit!
Get me out!
This is Wolf!
SPANISH BASQUE COUNTRY
TWO YEARS EARLIER
-Who can that be?
-Go back to sleep.
We've got the case.
Our friends need another favor.
What favor?
Mediometro and Txino,
-two great guys.
-What favor?
Let them stay here tonight.
We never agreed that, Arteaga.
We were staying with some girls
but we saw something...
It's not safe.
My father-in-law comes
here every day.
It's 2 in the morning.
Really?
We'll leave at dawn.
I said he was a great guy.
Right
See you.
Wasn't it just papers?
There's a bit of everything
but nothing explosive.
Are you crazy?
They're gudaris.
I couldn't say no.
Why not?
What do you owe them?
Everything's okay.
What do you mean?
Didn't you see his gun?
They fight for their beliefs.
Want your son to grow up
in a dictatorship?
I don't want to end up in jail.
The toilet's there.
There's food
-in the kitchen.
-Thanks.
You know him?
Yes, but he's got
a moustache now.
Like that?
More or less.
Narciso, the village taxi driver.
Him. He's an informer.
His time's up.
Is he a friend of yours?
This is a small place.
Don't tell me
you feel sorry for him.
His daughter's 9 years old.
ETAWANTS TO KILL YOU
You can't park here.
Move on.
Are you deaf?
I said move on!
Fatso, give Txema a drink.
Did you hear?
I saw it.
I said they were great guys.
A favor's one thing,
helping killers is another.
You just had a shock, that's all.
Have a drink and forget about it.
Everybody freeze!
Freeze!
Don't move,
you scumbags! Come on!
Come on! Move it!
Hurry up!
Hands in the air
where I can see them!
Come on!
Hurry up, dammit!
And you?
Hands on your head!
Come on!
Don't shoot!
What? Out of the way!
Come here.
Come on.
Speak to me in Spanish!
Got it?
Get out here!
Stand over there.
What are you looking at?
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me!
Stop shooting!
Everybody get up!
To the van!
Single file!
Single file!
Single file!
Your wife's shown
more sense than you.
She cooperated right
from the start.
Have you arrested her?
No, but she's in deep shit
thanks to you.
She hasn't done anything.
Just don't hurt her.
Take it easy.
I'm the good cop.
Why did you try to save him?
Don't you like
to see people killed?
Yet you were ready to help them.
Know why they killed him?
He saw two kids stealing
a car and tried to stop them.
They told him
they belonged to ETA.
Even so he told the police.
Then why don't you let me go?
You've committed various crimes.
Know what your problem is?
You're a coward.
You could've said no to Arteaga,
but you were scared.
You could've saved Narciso,
but you shit your pants
and now you feel bad.
I could make
all these papers disappear,
as if by magic.
And I mean white magic.
With no tricks.
You had a rough time.
-Same as always.
-Usually, people
shit themselves and talk.
I'll keep that in mind.
If the police
had got hold of this,
it would've been a disaster
for the local infrastructure.
-Can you be trusted?
-I've never been very involved.
You've done your bit in the past.
You may be hearing from us.
-Any trouble?
-No.
Did you bring what you said?
Come on.
This is Ricardo, Head
of Special Operations. SECED.
Never heard of it.
Secret service.
But don't tell anybody.
He's in a hurry to get home.
Here are the papers.
Originals,
copies and the carbon paper.
And the note.
Burn it all
when you get home.
I won't testify...
We take care
of our collaborators.
I'm not a collaborator.
We made a deal.
I did my part.
So we're even.
If you hear anything or need
anything, get in touch with me.
Even in hell,
friends are useful.
What do you think?
He's like a blank page.
We just need to put
a little pressure on him.
He's in construction,
you say?
He's got a small business.
What are you doing?
The owner stopped the work.
What?
Probably because of the arrests.
And the money he owes us?
I asked him,
but he's playing stupid.
I'll talk to the bastard.
I invested all I had in this.
If I were you,
I'd burn the place down.
Get in.
I'll pay you somehow.
Whatever it takes, I'll pay you.
Hi.
What's that?
My mother gave it
to me for supper.
Did you get paid?
Did you get paid?
We'll get by.
It's just a question of time.
Txema, stop dreaming.
You can't even pay the workers.
I know it's not your fault
but let's face it,
it's my dad who feeds us.
What do you want me to do?
Sell bibles door-to-door?
Don't be so proud.
My dad would help us.
I won't live at his expense.
It's not what we expected,
but it won't always be like this.
I'll fight to get the best
for the two of you. But my way.
It's terrible
about your business.
A few Arabs get together
to smoke pot
and people get ruined
by the price of oil.
How much are we talking about?
We like to keep
our people happy.
What do you want from me?
Information.
But it has to be first-hand.
If I hear anything,
I'll tell you.
We've already got
people out there.
What I want is...
somebody to infiltrate ETA.
I think they're going into action
so we need information
-to preempt them.
-Infiltrate?
That's dangerous.
Not that much.
You've done them favors.
They consider you one of them.
We'd work together.
I'd help you step by step
to get in
without them suspecting.
I don't know anything about spying.
But you've got courage
and principles.
We'll train you.
And pay you well.
If they plant bombs?
We'll stop them.
If they realize?
You should be able
to talk yourself out of it,
and think like them.
Trust us.
We've got the best men
and resources.
We need a Trojan horse.
You haven't answered my question.
We'll always keep you covered.
Any trouble and
we'll get you straight out.
To our enterprise.
Can anybody hear me?
Get me out of here, dammit!
This is Wolf.
Pick up the fucking phone!
FRENCH BASQUE COUNTRY
SEPTEMBER 18TH, 1973
Long live the newlyweds!
Congratulations, Aquiles.
Hey, cousin,
a lot of people came!
-Remember Loygorri?
-Sure. How are you?
Fine. Congratulations.
Let's go to the reception.
Okay.
There's the best man.
Asier. He's on the executive
committee with Arrieta and Nelson.
-You know him?
-Sure.
Hello, Asier.
How you doing?
-Remember me?
-Refresh my memory.
I'm...
Aquiles's cousin. I helped you
with the Vietnamese two years ago.
This is Txema.
A great guy.
-Hello.
-Hello.
He hid that case for us.
You can count on us for anything.
For the time being,
enjoy yourselves. See you.
See you.
I said there'd be VIP's here.
We are Basques,
of the Basque nations.
Here we are,
at the top of the mountain,
close to the Basque land,
with our eyes wide open,
our hearts burning.
Everything is so lovely,
so beautiful...
Long live Euskal Herria.
We are Basques,
of the Basque nations.
We are Basques,
of the Basque nations.
Long live free Euskadi!
So you returned the case.
My wife hid it
when they arrested me.
So can we count
on you for Biscay?
Arteaga and me...
Forget that idiot.
I need people with brains.
Are you interested?
That's what I came to France for.
Done your Military Service?
In Cerro Muriano.
Great.
That'll save us training you.
We'll talk again.
It's time to act
and forget about politics.
We need to do something big
in Spain.
If possible in Madrid.
Show them who we are.
You may get a big surprise soon...
Maybe.
-Hi.
-Hi.
I know you, don't I?
From Basauri.
Remember me?
No.
You should.
You've got it wrong.
I'd remember you
if I'd seen you before.
You sing very well.
Is this what you do?
No, I only sing at weddings
and left-wing masses.
My name's Amaia.
Txema.
Want a drag?
I don't smoke joints.
It's a nice party.
Fantastic.
A wedding,
but it's more
like an assembly.
Asier seems like
a simple kind of guy.
It's surprising
to see the bosses
so visible, isn't it?
Asier only writes.
The real boss is Arrieta.
And Nelson?
Isn't he coming?
I expect he's in Spain.
Nelson's like a general.
Asier thinks,
Arrieta gives the orders
and Nelson executes them.
But one day,
Nelson will be number one.
Do you know him?
I wish I did.
They say he walks around with
dynamite taped to his chest.
Like the Palestinians, in case
anyone tries to arrest him.
-And you believe that?
-No.
It's probably only hand grenades.
I'd like to meet your wife.
We've decided to split up.
Don't you love her any more?
Maybe we got married too young.
People split up because
one disappoints the other
or because they
develop in different ways.
In our case, it was
the organization.
I wanted to join,
she didn't want trouble.
I want to join, too.
But they only take single men.
They might make an exception
for someone who's separated.
I thought you were already in.
No. Sometimes I act
as a courier for them.
But they only want girls
for the soldiers' R & R.
You're cute.
Come on.
What are you doing?
Going for a swim?
Morning.
What's the rush?
They contacted me.
My first mission.
See you.
Try now.
Again.
Piece of shit!
Can I help?
We have to get
two rifles across the border.
Under the seats of my van.
Let's see.
We'll take your van
and give it back to you later.
No.
If you take a van
across without the owner,
they search it.
They'll be suspicious.
Fuck!
What have we got in common
with Andalusians or Asturians?
We never mixed our blood,
not with the Romans
or the Arabs or the Goths.
We are a race apart,
with our own blood and language.
The Spaniards want
to wipe out our culture.
So we have to
put up a fight.
When we're in power,
we'll get even with
the Basque oligarchy
for welcoming the enemy.
Let's stop for the bathroom.
Okay.
Want anything?
No, thanks.
Warn the border post.
I've got two rifles in my van.
That's not the order.
You'll have
to manage on your own.
Try and get
two rifles through?
It's Sunday.
I can't contact Spain.
I can only intervene
if they arrest you.
But try and avoid that.
Here. For the border.
Morning.
Where are you going?
Basauri.
You buy that porno crap
with such a pretty girlfriend?
Maybe I like it.
Out!
Come on!
These smart asses
think we're playing around.
-She was joking.
-Hands on the van.
Open the back door.
Okay.
Scumbags.
You can't joke
with people like that.
If I'd had a gun...
He touched my tits!
Tough shit!
I should make you walk home.
... a crater in the middle of the
road 8 meters wide and 4 deep
and serious damage
to the buildings
caused by the explosives
of the terrorists
who killed the President,
Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco.
The barbaric bombing
took place
on Claudio Coello St
near the corner of Maldonado.
The President had attended mass
at the Jesuit church...
What's happened?
Your friends
have killed the president.
Carrero Blanco?
I'd like to see it.
And I'd like you to leave.
-Can we talk?
-No.
Don't talk to me
or make any promises.
I love you enough to know
you believe in what you're doing.
Whatever that is.
Maybe it's not what you think.
So what?
I know I can't sleep at night,
that when you go out,
it'll be
to kill or be killed.
I don't want
that kind of life.
We must avenge
the President's death.
MADRID
DECEMBER 23RD, 1973
The army should
bring out the tanks
and wipe out
the pro-independence movement.
The orders are clear.
No special repression against the
illegal parties or their leaders.
That goes for
all sections of the SECED.
So why have a secret service?
We have to take action
and show no leniency.
I'd have all
the political prisoners shot
but till Franco
appoints a new government,
-my hands are tied.
-General...
I'll make ETA pay for this
without involving the government.
We have groups ready to act
and give them what they deserve.
And start another civil war?
Our feelings mustn't
run away with us.
ETA isn't just
a gang of killers.
We underestimated them
and they've hit us hard.
But with intelligence
we can hit back.
Do you have a proposal?
So far we haven't been able
to get to the leaders of ETA.
That's our objective. We must
find them and neutralize them.
That's in the hands
of the police
and the Civil Guard.
I'm talking about another way.
Away to enable us
to get inside ETA.
To infiltrate an agent
into the very heart
of the group.
Other agents
have already tried.
But they all lost their cover.
I'm talking about
infiltrating a Basque agent
above all suspicion at the top.
A veritable
mole.
And when we find out
everything about the leaders,
we can take them apart.
It's the only way.
You have such an agent?
-His code name's "Wolf."
-"Wolf"?
Don't make me laugh.
He's been with us for 6 months.
He's managed to join
one of their cells.
The next step
is to send him
to seek refuge in France
where the leaders hide out.
You think he can get
to the top?
It's all a question
of time, trust and money.
And meanwhile
-we just sit back?
-Drop it.
We can ask the new president
to turn a blind eye.
Till then, put your plans
for punishment on hold.
As for your mole,
you have a free hand.
Make sure he rises
within the group
and keep me informed.
Gentlemen...
We've got the stuff.
Want to see the plans?
It'll take a week.
The hidden entrance
will be here,
a false door in the tiling.
And we can use
part of the cellar.
That's how it'll be?
More or less.
Eight square meters. Room for a
sink, toilet, bed and table.
And the swimming pool?
This is a jail, not a hotel.
3 square meters is enough.
-It's a person...
-An exploiter.
So fuck him.
So where does he shit?
And wash?
He can wash in a bucket
and shit in another.
When you've finished,
we'll go and get him.
Who's leading this cell?
Mediometro.
Barrera will leave
for the factory.
We cut him off here....
we get him out of his car...
Loygorri drives up in the van....
Paint the van
and change the plates.
Put Barrera in the back
and bring him in.
It's a trap!
He's losing a lot of blood.
He's got a bullet
in his stomach.
And him in the shoulder.
What are you doing?
Let's go to France.
We'll never make it.
I'm in charge of this cell!
I'm in charge from now on.
What happened?
They were waiting for us.
I don't know.
We need help.
Don't run out on us.
I'll get you out.
I should shoot
both of you!
Fuck off and lower the gun!
We said no shooting.
It wasn't our fault.
Some agents from Madrid
got out of hand.
Out of hand?
They tried to massacre us!
You were told to get out
with your girlfriend,
not get into this mess!
Ricardo, you almost
killed Arteaga,
and the other one's wounded too.
Then we'll take him
to hospital.
No.
I want a doctor
and safe passage to France.
I can't involve a doctor.
They'll suspect me otherwise.
Get me a doctor or I'm out.
Stray from the plan again
and you're dead.
FRENCH BASQUE COUNTRY
OCTOBER 30TH, 1974
Action, repression, action!
That's our strategy.
Euskalerria isn't
a territorial concept.
Wherever a family
sits around a hearth
and speaks in our language...
There's the Basque soul.
Until the Spaniards came.
Can you be Basque
without speaking Euskera?
My folks are from Hendaye
and always spoke French to me.
All Basques should learn
their language.
And the Basques
who say they're Spanish
and want to stay
within the Spanish state?
Them?
Let them leave.
What's your name?
Txema Loygorri.
Loygorri.
I've heard of you.
I'm Nelson.
The history of the Basque nation
is one of traitors.
Basques who helped the Spaniards
to rob us of what we are.
That's why we're here.
To teach them a lesson
and get back what we've lost.
Know what this is?
A bullet.
The bullet
I reserve for traitors.
If you meet a traitor,
kill him for me.
We can't build our homeland
without bloodshed.
So get ready to suffer.
We are Basque combatants,
here to free Euskadi.
Generous is the blood
that we shall shed for it
The call is heard
from the hilltop,
"Become a soldier for your flag!"
Long live free Euskadi!
Long live Euskadi!
Who is it?
Please don't hang up.
I'm in France.
What do you want?
How are you?
Lonely.
I miss you.
How's the kid?
Fine. He had another
tooth come in.
I'd like to see you.
But I can't right now.
Did you get the money?
Yes. And I want you to stop
sending it and to forget us.
You'll only get us in trouble.
I wish I could tell you.
I don't want to know.
Sooner or later you'll know.
If you call back
I'll hang up.
While Nelson's in Hendaye,
he'll stay here.
This is for Nelson.
All right.
Nelson,
I hear you're planning something
big and I'd like to help.
All in good time, Loygorri.
I don't mean
just with the cell.
Some architect friends
of mine work in Spain.
I've done some work for them.
With that as cover, I could
take care of the safe houses.
You know Madrid
and Barcelona?
Yes. I've worked there
and I know them well.
Asier wants you to read this.
It's not a bad idea.
We'll talk again.
I'd like to stay
but we need to change base.
There's a room
at Asier's place.
I'm staying here.
Nelson and his people
need someone to clean and cook.
I'm going to volunteer.
Everything's organized.
They don't need servants.
They need all the free time
they can get.
I want to be here to help.
I thought you and me...
Don't start
getting sentimental.
There aren't many people
I can talk to.
Most people forget
that above all else
we want to change society.
We must move
towards independence.
For that, what must
be clear are the path,
the rhythm
and those at the helm.
Everyone has an opinion.
I want to know yours.
I'd prefer no weapons.
That's no answer.
Who would you support
if things got tough?
If I had to choose,
I'd stay with Arrieta and you.
Arrieta's days are numbered.
But for me,
Nelson would've got rid of him.
My fight is with him.
That's why I'm going
to attack him in the report.
The only way to stop him
is to stand up to him.
So I need to know
where you stand.
I saw the light.
Do you need anything?
No.
Then I'll go to bed.
Sleep well.
Thanks.
And I wanted to say...
For me... you're a god.
Why do you say that?
Come in.
You're worried...
I couldn't sleep.
People you trust suddenly turn
on you with words that mean nothing
but which beguile others
and lead them astray.
Words are necessary.
Words deceive.
Actions don't.
It's too early for this,
but it's bold
and addresses questions
on everyone's mind.
It's open to debate.
It's just Spanish-loving shit!
No one surrenders here,
under Franco or democracy.
Nobody's talking
of surrender
but of preparing for the change.
There are a lot
of people in France
who should come back to Euskadi
to work on the social
and union fronts,
and among young people...
We should create a network enabling
us to become a political party.
And give up
the armed struggle?
Under democracy, our people
might question the attacks.
We'll lose their support
if we lay down our arms
-before we attain independence.
-No.
We could negotiate an amnesty
and freedom for
the Basque people.
We're nowhere without force.
In the future, we'll get
more through politics.
This is the only
politics of the Basque people!
Anyone who doesn't agree
can leave the organization.
You don't want independence.
You just want power
for your own means.
Well, over my dead body!
This needs a solution.
You're number one,
and you should assume
the responsibility.
I'll call an assembly.
There's still time
for you to leave.
You have nothing to prove.
Take a train for Paris
and forget all this.
We're making a revolution.
If that's the way
you feel, you leave.
But I'm not afraid.
Since Asier,
you've had doubts.
-Do you mind leaving us?
-I mind.
Asier was like
a brother to me.
We've had good times
and bad times together,
but his death's been the worst.
We've got big things planned.
We have to cut ballast and fly.
-You could have removed Asier.
-He wouldn't have agreed to that.
Not Asier.
He'd have caused a split.
We have to be united,
trust each other.
All go in the same direction.
What's done is done.
We have to separate
the men from the boys.
Is the assembly
still on for Thursday?
Nelson's going
to stage his accession.
Will there be
a lot of people?
The leadership
plus those forming
the cells in Spain.
Here's the list.
On Thursday,
at around 1 PM,
find some excuse to get out.
Why?
Are you planting a bomb?
Are you crazy?
It'll be a massacre!
They want to make things
easier by flushing them out.
It's not our doing...
Then whose is it?
A few out-of-control right-wing
fanatics who want action.
Out-of-control?
But you know about the bomb?
And what about me?
Play it by ear.
Very soon,
we'll be leaving for Spain
for the biggest attack
in history.
Who'll volunteer for
the special cells?
Great!
We'll organize several groups
who'll leave for Spain
once the safe houses
are ready.
Txema, you'll leave with
the first cell to take care of that.
Mediometro.
Before you go, line up, please.
We need photographs
for the false ID's.
No, Txino.
Look serious.
Loygorri.
I need cigarettes.
About the safe houses...
We'll avenge our wounded.
We'll hit them back
100 times as hard.
You'll enter Spain
by the Pyrenees.
Our people will meet you
and give you
fresh instructions.
-How will we know them?
-Mediometro's
in charge. The password's
inside the passport.
If there's
any trouble, you know
what number to call.
Check the papers,
guns and money.
Long live free Euskadi!
Free Euskadi!
Hit them hard, Loygorri,
but be careful.
Watch yourself, Nelson.
Watch yourself.
Hey.
I like your shirt.
It's the only one I've got.
I'm Montse, this is Fabiana,
Catalan Liberation Front.
-Got the tickets?
-Yes.
Get in. We have to hurry.
Not you.
You're going to Madrid.
This is our
main target: Nelson,
head of the special cells.
He organized
Carrero's assassination.
If we catch him, we take out
the most dangerous faction in ETA.
The ball starts rolling tomorrow.
Pantxo is Wolf's contact.
Contreras,
Mejia and Leon
are joining the team.
Inspector Soto
will direct surveillance,
Matias the infrastructure.
More agents will join us
as we need them.
Do we have the people
for the listening devices?
No. We'll set a group up.
Find a locksmith, a painter
and a builder
to install the mikes.
And put up
the architect's sign.
Where's Wolf?
At a hostel,
waiting to get started.
Gentlemen...
We're dealing with ETA's most
dangerous members, so I want you all
on your toes.
Get to work.
Hey, look who's here.
It's Txino.
Follow him when he leaves.
-Can I get you something?
-No, thanks.
We're staying in a dormitory.
We want to get out right away.
We'll need three apartments
and a garage for a van
and two or three cars.
And the cells should keep
alow profile when they get here.
Ineed some cash
for the deposit.
Same time,
day after tomorrow.
See you.
-I got you a souped-up 124.
-What about the apartments?
These three are for the cells.
Once they're in,
anybody who goes in or out
will be tailed.
You'll be staying
somewhere else.
Nobody, not even our people,
knows about this place.
So what's worrying you?
You need a safe house
away from everything.
Spanish National Radio news.
General Franco is recovering nicely
from the trombophlebitis
which hospitalized him
at La Paz Hospital in Madrid.
His usual medical team
informed the press this morning
that despite initial complications
his life is not in danger,
which means he could be
released shortly.
Nevertheless,
government sources announced
that according to legislation
Prince Juan Carlos,
heir to the Spanish throne,
could assume leadership
of the country temporarily
for as long as necessary.
Where did you get this thing?
My friend the architect
lent it to me.
Nice friends you've got there.
It's even got local plates.
Don't repeat
what I'm about to tell you.
We're all meeting in Madrid
to free the prisoners in Segovia.
-How many of them?
-All of them.
We'll bust them out.
Then we'll all meet in Lisbon.
We'll organize
ahuge rally there as our
welcome to the world.
Shit!
How will you do that?
We'll need more safe houses.
How many are coming?
About twenty.
Stop the car.
It's for you.
Ilike my men to carry a back up,
just in case...
Bye.
BARCELONA
MARCH 29TH, 1975
If there's trouble,
shoot your way back to the car.
I'll cover your backs.
We have to help them.
Stop.
There's nothing we can do.
Have we identified
the detainees?
One's having surgery
at the hospital.
We questioned the other one.
It's Arrieta.
Arrieta?
How strange.
How could ETA's number one
be caught so foolishly?
The cops got
acall. Did your team know
Arrieta was in Barcelona?
We were only covering
the Madrid cell.
Captain,
I'm very distressed.
The operation has thus far been
fruitless and suddenly
the Barcelona police
arrest the number one.
They were lucky.
It won't affect the operation.
And if the others feel unsafe
in Barcelona,
-they might flee to Madrid.
-Or slip
through our fingers.
This news shouldn't
be aired quite yet.
We are in agreement.
But I think it's time to hunt whoever
we can and make our success public.
General, sir.
If we abort now,
most of the cells
will stay in France.
The hardliners
will be strengthened.
We must capture Nelson.
Do you know his whereabouts?
Sooner or later,
he'll come to Madrid.
What if he doesn't?
We can't let Barcelona police
steal our medals.
Don't you get it?
Wolf was difficult
to infiltrate.
And expensive, Captain.
We've never been this high.
If we arrest them now
we'll miss our chance.
We miss it either way.
Iwant them detained
in less than 24 hours.
The operation is cancelled.
-There's no time to warn Wolf.
-The agent
is of no consequence.
If he must be sacrificed,
so be it.
Better to lose him than let
the others escape.
Icreated Wolf and I oppose
his elimination.
You cannot oppose.
You're off this operation.
The major and his men
shall see to it.
-It's a mistake.
-It's an order!
So think this through
before throwing
your career away.
Dismissed.
Yes, sir.
Chief, a colleague
in Barcelona called me.
Arrieta got arrested
during a robbery.
We should warn Wolf.
It's a bad time to meet.
It wouldn't be the first time
we got a bad tip.
This is a good source.
Forget it.
I'm going on holiday.
Palacios is taking over.
In mid-operation?
Ialways take a week
this time of year.
What? Is that all?
-What?
-It doesn't work.
-Should we back off?
-No.
You'll do it.
Gather yourself,
aim high and blow
their heads off.
Are you scared?
No more than you were
at the robbery.
Teams 2 and 3. Txino, Reto
and Gordo are in position.
We see them.
Over.
Wolf just pulled in.
Get ready. Over.
-Roger.
-We're all here.
Have you heard the news?
About Barcelona?
This isn't part of the plan.
It feels wrong.
Maybe they changed the plan.
France doesn't know either.
Right, let's get to it.
We buy the plastic,
put it in the car
and we hide a few days
until the dust clears.
Pass me the radio.
Ineed it to talk to my men.
Stop screwing around.
Pass me the radio.
They're inside, Chief.
Over.
Roger. Cut the traffic.
What the hell is going on?
Attention all units.
,This is Chief Palacios,
head of this operation.
Hold positions
and cede to police.
Chief, this is Pantxo.
This is our operation.
Idemand an explanation.
Your operation is cancelled.
As soon as they come out,
we take them.
If they resist, shoot to kill.
If you have a problem,
leave like your boss did.
He showed some common sense.
What about Wolf?
Just another member of ETA.
Over.
Are they crazy?
He's with us!
Iwouldn't want to be him.
This'll be bloody.
The cars.
Run!
Get down!
Come on, dammit!
Are you all right?
It's nothing.
Let's separate.
We'll have better luck.
Okay.
-Good luck.
-Goodbye.
Goodbye, my friend.
Stop!
Drop your gun, motherfucker!
Come on!
Go on, bastard!
Stop! Stop!
Don't kill him!
Leave him alone!
Call an ambulance!
We're with the SECED.
Txema isn't here. Reorganize.
I'll be at the office.
He'll probably call.
This is an answering machine.
Leave a message after the tone.
This is Wolf.
-What the fuck?
-Txema! Where are you?
What the fuck happened?
I'm hiding at 12, Guadalquivir.
The police are searching the area.
Get me out of here.
Who is it?
Yes?
There's a car ready for you.
And the others?
There isn't time.
Trade clothes with me.
Quickly.
There's cash in the car.
Hide till I come get you.
We'll clear the way for you.
Hello?
-Medio?
-Loygorri, well now.
It's fucking great
to hear your voice.
How are things?
Bad, but spirits are high.
Where are you?
Hiding since the mess.
In Madrid.
Ialmost got caught.
They tried to kill us.
That bastard must think
we're stupid.
,  Loygorri, this is Nelson.
Come to France
for a debriefing.
-When?
-Immediately.
They're looking all over for me.
Is something wrong?
Yes. People here are nervous.
They've heard rumors.
What rumors?
Stuff.
We'll discuss it in person.
Txema, it's me.
I'm on your side, remember?
Who decided to sacrifice me?
The police are upset
about the bombing.
It was out of our hands.
And Ricardo?
He left for a convention
the day before.
He ordered me killed
and went to a convention?
He had nothing to do with it.
Shit. I was so afraid.
And that damn machine...
Iwas so scared
Ialmost shot the old man.
Relax, I know how you feel.
No, you don't.
They think I'm a terrorist.
Everyone but ETA.
Have they contacted you?
They want me to go back
for my passport.
How could they know
if I had to shoot my way out?
The old man told the BBC
you used the code name "Wolf."
Then why won't the government
explain my mission?
If ETA knows, tell everyone.
The Secret Service
doesn't like publicity.
Iam not a terrorist!
I'm Wolf.
Iwork for you guys.
-People should know.
-What will you do?
Tell the press?
They'll send you to Mexico.
Here's a new passport
and plane tickets.
You'll be met at the airport.
Ricardo will visit you later.
Is that all?
They try to kill me then give me
tickets and a pat on the back?
That's how this business is.
Some of us get screwed
and others get medals.
Can I have my gun back?
Personally,
I'm proud of you.
Good luck.
He wasn't on the flight.
Where is he?
We spotted him
on the way to France.
What the hell will he do there?
Nothing.
Iwant him on the next flight
to Mexico.
That's impossible.
Why?
We let him across.
You what?
He's out of control.
I'm holding you responsible.
Find a way to get to him
and neutralize him.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Wolf? What the hell is that?
Who saw that interview?
Let whoever saw it
say it to my face.
What is this?
Acourt-martial?
Enough paranoia. We need revenge
for what happened in Madrid.
We just want your version.
This is my version.
If you think I'm a traitor,
shoot me.
Why are you nervous?
You're accusing me of treason.
Irisked my life for you.
Both of you.
Two days in hiding,
chased,
surrounded, shot at...
And you think I'm a mole?
Fuck you all.
You're worse than the cops.
Txema's right.
Nelson and I got away
in Barcelona.
So what?
Someone could just as easily
think we're moles.
-Bullshit, Amaia.
-It's not, Medio.
Someone tipped the cops
about the bank.
And besides us,
Txino was the only one who knew.
But they killed him,
so that rules him out.
What are you implying?
That if there's a mole,
it could be Txema
or any of us.
The old man also said
you made a call
and got rescued.
Icalled my architect friend
and he got me out.
And who is he?
The one who gets
the apartments.
Itold you about him.
He helps us and we leave him alone.
MADRID
SEPTEMBER 4TH, 1975
You can stay if you want.
-Pantxo can find me another.
-This one's fine.
Still think I'm a mole?
Put your guns on the floor.
Slowly.
Put them on.
Hands behind your back.
You're not going to shoot me?
Sit down.
Nelson tipped them
about the bank.
He killed Asier
and sold Arrieta.
We can't trust him any more.
It's time to retire him
and take over
the organization.
You and me.
Hi.
Ihave to go to Barcelona
to pick up Nelson.
We'll go by air. Separate flights.
It's safer than by car.
What about the guns?
I'll take care of it.
Here, a new identity
for your collection.
Chief, we've located
Pantxo. He's just bought
an air ticket to Barcelona.
-Under what name?
-His own.
None of Wolf's known aliases
are on the passenger list.
You think they're together?
Idon't know. I don't know.
But if anyone knows where Wolf is,
it's Pantxo.
They might meet in Barcelona.
Check the list again.
Iwant two men on the flight
and a team waiting on the ground.
We need to finish
this fucking thing.
We intercepted a call from Wolf
but couldn't trace it.
What did they say?
Something about migrating birds.
We're decoding it. This is it.
Pantxo, Pantxo,
Pantxito.
Where's Wolf?
Ihave no idea.
Where's Wolf?
Answer the chief.
Carrying out his mission.
When the time comes,
he'll give us the cells
on a platter.
That's fine.
But you may recall,
I'm in charge of this operation.
For your own good,
tell us what you know.
The kid deserves a chance.
You can either tell us
the easy way
or the hard way.
Put him in the tub.
What?
We decoded the message.
He's coming to Madrid with a cell.
He arrives tomorrow
at 8 A.M. by train.
Good.
Major, that's enough.
We were a little too rough.
Do something about it.
What about the body?
Bury it in quicklime.
And clean up this shit.
Get on.
This is ours.
Don't sit down.
It's full of cops.
Can you take us to Madrid?
That'll cost a bundle.
We'll pay you.
-And my return.
-Done.
We lost him.
Yes, sir.
Whatever you say.
Mejia!
Nothing new, Chief.
No sign of Wolf
or the other cells.
Dammit.
You guys are useless.
We have every available man
searching the city.
Then get more men from
the Police or the Ministry.
Chief, he's here.
He wants to see you.
-Who's here?
-Me.
Iwant to talk to you.
Alone.
You heard him, back to work.
Come in.
So you've taken over
the operation yourself.
Where the hell is Pantxo?
Who do you think
you're talking to?
Pantxo reported to us
the whole time.
Isimply relieved him
due to stress.
Itried to contact you in Barcelona,
but you gave us the slip.
Have the cells arrived?
,If Pantxo reported to you,
you should know.
We didn't want to interfere.
We're not even watching
the apartments,
to avoid suspicion.
How many have come?
They're arriving.
Around 30 of them.
Including
Nelson?
Including Nelson.
Here are the names
and addresses.
You're good, Wolf.
There's more we can do.
My plan could dismantle
the organization once and for all.
Isee.
Sooner or later, moles
always react the same way.
But operations end.
Accept it and enjoy
your retirement.
If I go back to France,
Icould easily
reopen the debate
and turn it into a political
,  movement, with Asier's ideas.
You're burnt.
When they find out
what you've done
they'll string you up.
Not if I escape again.
You shoot me in the arm,
and I go back to France wounded.
Nobody will suspect me.
Really,
you've gone quite far.
But it's over.
If we don't they'll keep killing.
They'll tear apart
the Basque Country
and impede democracy.
And we'll keep fighting them.
What's the problem?
We can finish off ETA, dammit!
And then what do we do?
Open up a shop?
This country is about to change.
Without terrorism,
the Left would demand too much.
We need it
to soften the transition.
But they'll keep killing!
They do their job,
Ido mine.
,  Like you, Jose Maria.
Now we're anti-terrorism experts.
We're indispensable
to any government.
That's what I risked
my life for?
Your mission is over.
We'll help you
start your life over.
-What life?
-The one you chose.
-What life?
-You wanted to be a hero?
Heroes get killed.
Consider yourself lucky
you're still alive.
You're a bunch of fascists.
And you're a son of a bitch.
As your superior,
Idemand your sidearm.
Don't get any tears
on my carpet.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Yes, very sunny.
Aperfect day to die.
You were hard to find, Nelson.
But worth the trouble.
If you're patient,
the fish always bite.
And you're a big fish.
The king of the bowl.
You think?
You've done wonderfully.
Don't ruin the finale.
Take out your gun,
slowly,
and put it on the table.
You're surrounded.
Ireally prefer you alive.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Yes.
Sons of bitches!
...the anti-ETA task force,
as we've reported since last night,
is carrying out raids
against the gang across Spain,
leading to a series of arrests.
In Madrid several terrorists...
What happened?
They're arresting everyone.
We'll go back to France.
It's over, Amaia.
Don't take it so hard.
We'll get through it.
We'll reorganize.
We're all that's left.
Wolf's job is finished.
It was you?
I've been fucking a cop
the whole time.
I'm not a cop.
How could you betray us?
I'm Basque, too.
No Basque betrays his own people.
You aren't my people.
You're a bunch of fanatics.
You make me sick.
If you come with me,
you have a chance.
They'll kill you.
Iswear it.
We'll kill you.
Sir, a few questions.
In all, more than 100 members of ETA
have been arrested.
Yes, it's undoubtedly the biggest
operation ever against ETA.
Has the organization
been eliminated?
That's hard to say.
All I can say is we've dismantled
substantial infrastructure
and the operation
remains open.
Is it true the key
to the operation was a mole?
No comment. Thank you.
Ricardo's sorry
he couldn't make it.
He's very busy.
He sends his best wishes.
And congratulations
from the President himself.
As well as the Ministry,
General Ortega and,
of course, Ricardo.
Don't toss the money,
Icould use it.
There's a flight to Mexico pending.
I'll make sure you're on it.
Pantxo
sends a postcard from the other side
of the Iron Curtain.
He got promoted, like everyone.
-Mom, who is it?
-A traitor.
Atraitor to the Basque Country.
Squad!
Ready...
Aim...
-Long live ETA!
-Long live!
Fire!
You leave tonight.
Amaia handles the cell.
Anything else?
Yes.
Make sure you save a bullet.
This one's for Wolf.
Extra, extra!
NOVEMBER 20TH, 1975
Franco's dead!
Franco's dead!
Extra, extra!
Franco's dead!
There you are, sir.
Thank you, son.
You're welcome, sir.
Operation Wolf led to the arrest
of 150 members of ETA,
the greatest success
in police history.
After Franco's death,
Prince Juan Carlos
ascended to the Spanish throne
and decreed amnesty
for all political prisoners,
including those of ETA.
One year later, the Spanish people
approved in referendum
the Law of Political Reform,
which brought about
the first democratic elections
since the Spanish Civil War.
Thirty years after these events,
,  "Wolf,"
protected by a new identity,
remains on ETA's death list.
