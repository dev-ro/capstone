Hey! Come on.
Let's move!
No!
- Let me see.
- No.
Come on, I made you
special breakfast.
You can't cook.
Hey, Mary, open up.
GIFTED
You look beautiful.
I look like Disney character.
Where's the special?
What?
You said you made me special breakfast.
Please, don't make me go.
You can keep home schooling me.
I've taught you everything I know.
But I don't want to go.
Well... I don't want to go
to work, but I do.
You don't go to work.
You fix boats on the dock.
Okay, it's poor example,
but you are still going.
But... But what about Fred?
What about him?
You won't take care of him.
You don't like cats.
I don't like two-eyed cats.
Fred is as you know, monocular.
Who's gonna throw him his ping pong ball?
Fred's gonna be fine,
no more argument, okay?
We've discussed this ad nauseam.
What's an nauseam?
You don't know? Looks like
someone needs school.
This is gonna be fun.
You're gonna meet kids today, you gonna
borrow money from the rest of your life.
Come on.
You gonna be great.
You know, just...
I don't know. Try bein' a kid.
Frank!
Frank, I know you hear me.
Frank!
There's still time for you
to undo this nonsense.
Go get in your car and go get that child.
Are you tehnically allowed to use
these keys whenever you want?
How you can stand there...
acting all calm and all of
that making light out of this?
Now, go get her back before it's too late.
She gotta go out in the world.
She has not friend her age.
No social skills.
She doessn't know how to be a kid.
Two nights ago she told me
that even if Germany bails up
the euro, there could still
be worldwide depression.
I was staring at the
celling for three hours.
I'm so worried.
Come on, Roberta.
If you start crying, I will have
to pretend to start crying.
You know there's something
you can be overlooking.
This could work out.
Maybe.
But if anybody takes that baby away...
I'll smother you in your sleep.
Morning, Fred.
One plus one is two.
That is fact number one of today.
Who can tell me what two plus two is?
Who's got it?
Four.
Excellent, Donna.
It is. Two plus two is indeed four.
Okay, who wants to try three plus three?
Three plus three? Really?
I beg your pardon?
What kind of school is this anyway?
It's the kind of school, where
students don't speak without permission.
Alright, but everyone knows it's six.
Nobody in this classroom speaks...
unless they're called upon.
Okay? Is everybody clear on that?
Yes, ma'am.
Good. Mary, can you stand up please?
Stand up on. Stand up, babe.
These questions are for you,
because you're so advanced.
What is nine plus eight?
Seventeen.
Yeah, yes, it is. That's good.
What is...
fifteen plus seventeen?
Thirty-two.
Yeah, that is... That is right.
Alright then.
Well, what is 57 plus 135?
192.
Yeah.
Can you tell me...
What 57 multiplied by 135 is?
Okay.
- Who can tell me what four...
- 7695.
I don't think anyone can do that.
The square root is 87.7.
And change.
Now what does ad nauseam mean?
I have very strange kid.
I have 27 strange kids.
Good morning.
Good morning, good morning.
That's great, guys,
but take your seats, okay?
Oh, God, see ya.
Good morning, Miss Stevenson.
Good morning.
- Mind if I sit in?
- Not at all.
Okay, class.
I have a treat for you.
I would like to introduce you to
our principal Mrs. Davis.
Good morning, first graders.
Good morning, Mrs. Davis.
- Are you ready for a great year?
- Yes.
Yes, Mary?
She's the boss?
Mrs. Davis is our principal, okay.
Ok, now I want you to get on
your phone and call Frank
and told him to get me out of here!
Wait a minute. That's the dad? I know him.
I see him at Ferg's
almost every Friday night.
He's the quiet damaged hot guy.
What are you doing at
Ferg's every Friday night?
Trying to get picked up by him.
Excuse me? Hi.
Look it's my teacher.
Probably she wants
to remind me what one plus one is.
Go to the car, okay?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sorry to yell at you
and then chase you down.
It's okay. Mary's teacher?
Yes. I'm Bonnie Stevens.
Frank. How are you? Sorry about today.
She got little overexcited.
It's just first day jitters.
Sure, yeah.
We are running a little bit late
actually, so we gotta get going.
Okay, I don't even wanna talk about that.
- I will keep you just a minute.
- Okay.
I think your daugter...
I think Mary might be gifted.
What?
Yeah, today in math,
she answered some really...
- No, that's...
- No, please.
- It's not gifted.
- Really difficult questions.
Right.
- Just the seven year old would...
- It's Trachtenberg.
- Jakow Trachtenberg.
- I'm sorry?
Spent seven years in a concentration camp.
Developed the sistem to
rapidly solve problems.
It's the Trachtenberg method.
But she is...
I mean... She's seven though.
I learned it when I was eight.
Do I look gifted to you?
It kinda go out of note since the
invention of the calculator...
But... I can still win a drink
at the bar using it.
Sorry for today.
Won't happen again.
Okay.
Nice to meet you.
Bonnie.
Frank.
Trachenberg method.
For the record, I didn't wanna go to
the stupid school in the first place.
And the boy in the front row acts
inappropriately for someonewho's a child.
Sorry. I'm still passive
agressively ignoring you.
Other kids answer questions,
they don't get in trouble.
You didn't get in trouble
for answering the questions.
You yelled at the principle.
All right, you know what?
You're gonna find this interesting.
So I googled
"first graders who yelled at the principal"
And statistically you will never
believe how many kids do it.
How many?
None.
Frank, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Yeah, right.
You can't show off like that in school.
I know.
You promised you wouldn't
then at the first day...
I know, I screwed up.
Do you think this boat needs a test ride?
Go get, Fred.
Don't run.
d I listen to the wind,
to the wind of my soul d
d Where I will end up, well
I think only God really knows d
d I've sat upon the setting sun d
d But never, never, never, never d
d I never wanted water ones d
d Never, never, never d
Fred loves to watch the sandpipers.
He thinks he'd like to catch one,
but he'd regret it.
Fred's not the killer.
He's a lover.
Would mom want me to go to school?
I can only guess.
But I will tell you that, she would
have wanted you to have friends.
Idiot friends?
She'd want you to have
compassion for others.
Like a cat can have for a sandpiper.
But what if they don't like me?
Then they're idiots.
Good morning, class.
Good moring, Mrs. Stevenson.
Good morning, Mary.
Good morning, Mrs. Stevenson.
Okay, good morning.
Get a hold of yourself.
For my Show and tell I have...
the most awesome cat
in the history of times.
Not only is his name Fred, but...
He has just one eye.
Uno. Go ahead and count...
but I promise you is always one.
How did he lose his eye?
I don't know. I wasn't there.
Just found him inside a trash can next
to the bottle of alcohol or something.
He is a smart, smart cat,
but no one realizes that.
No one understands him. No one.
Put your name in on the top of the paper,
so I know who did such a good work.
I left my pen with you.
Pass those around guys.
Okay? I wanna see your work.
Turn around. Face the desk.
Think about how you get to the answer.
It's not just about, you know, guessing.
Don't be messy.
Done.
Let me see.
Okay, I thought you might finish quickly,
so a little something extra.
Done.
Francis Adler
Frank Adler speaks at this
year's Leader's Conference
Francis Adler, mathematician
A Mind for math: Is Diane Adler the missing female variable
that finally solves the Navier-Stokes Equation?
Renowned Mathematician dead of an
apparent suicide
She is survived by a brother Frank.
Do you know who I am?
Hey! Mary's teacher...
Bonnie.
You lied to me.
Okay.
Can you narrow it down?
I'd like to know the truth about Mary...
... my student.
Your niece.
I was running ridiculously
late for a date...
and my sister showed up with Mary.
She never showed up unannounced.
She never showed up with the baby.
She said she wanted to talk.
She said she needed to talk.
I told her I will talk to her when I
got back.
I think I figured showing up late to my date
would hurt my chances of gettin' laid.
Came home that night and
Mary was on the couch...
and found Diane on the bathroom floor.
I mean, there's no way I could've
known, but...
I shoulda known.
6 and a half years later me and Mary
are still hangin' out.
And what about the father?
Diane was so socially akward...
She didn't date enough to know
a good guy from a bad guy.
This particular guy didn't last for month.
And no grandparents?
Dad died when I was eight. My mom...
She went virgin and she turn back on Diane
when she got pregnant.
Why?
Didn't fit into her plan.
She is exacting woman, my mother.
Uncompromising.
Very British.
Do you mean British in demeanor or...
- No. Like she is...
- She's from England.
From England. Yeah.
So Mary is a genius?
Look out. Look out.
Your little animals are escaping, dumbass.
Hey! You should not be laughing!
You did a mean thing to a little kid.
What are you gonna do about it?
Hey. Hey, you okay?
You good? All right.
How do we resolve this? You know,
she could be expelled.
God. I hope not.
But if any first-time offenders got
expelled, well I guess fair is fair.
Are you gonna take
this serously?
Sure. You don't bluff me. I don't
bluff you.
Miss Stevenson believes that your
child is exceptional.
And has talents that our cricium
can't begin to challenge.
It just so happens, that I'm good friend
with the headmaster...
... of the Oaks Academy for
Gifted Education.
He always said that if I find that
one in a million...
And the one in a million has a
$30.000 tuition.
Mr. Edgar, I can get your
daughter a scolarship.
Full ride.
I wouldn't say it, if I couldn't
do it.
I realize, putting that girl in that
setting...
You know, 99 times out of a 100, that's
is what you do.
It's the Oaks. It's great school.
I looked into it.
This family has a history with
those schools.
And I think the last thing that
little girl needs...
is reinforcement that she's
different.
Trust me, she knows, so...
I think Mary. I think she's gotta
be here.
Today's bad ending, you can't
hit people.
But a 12 year old bullies a 7 year old
and she stands up?
Do you know how important
that is to me that she did that?
You know how proud I am of her?
Aren't you?
Mr. Edgar, your daughter shattered a
young boy's...
I know. You can't hit people.
That will be made
very clear. I get that.
But Miss Davis, if we seperate
our leaders...
If we segregate them from people
like you and me...
you get congressman.
So I'm sorry. I wish I can take
you offer, but Mary stays.
Unless you kick her out.
This is a mistake. We'll never
be able to raise this child...
to the level of scholarship she deserves.
Well... She dumb her down to a
decent human being.
Everybody wins.
You know what? Just...
Can you excuse me for just 1 minute?
Bring me all the piece of
paperwork we have on this girl.
Hey.
Are you sure you know what
you're doing?
No.
Okay Mary, I think you have something
?ou'd like to say to the class
You wanna hop up and say it?
Okay. I'm supposed to say something.
Hitting people is wrong even if the're bad.
I won't do it again, so don't be
afraid of me.
Okay. Thank you.
Now I can say something I wanna say?
Sure.
Before they ruined it...
Justin's zoo was the best
art project.
By far. It was awesome.
Come on. A little harder.
Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.
There's a lady standing in front
of our door.
Who is it?
How should I know? I'm seven.
That would be your grandmother.
Holy shit!
An Apple?
It's a MacBook, darling.
Top of the line with the Retina display.
You know who else has
a Retina display?
Fred!
Mary, I understand you like mathematics.
So, on there...
You will found a great out of print book by
Charles Zimmer...
called Transitions in Advanced Algebra.
Yeah. Love that book.
You're saying you've read it?
Yeah, I've kinda moved on to differential
equations now.
Don't forget your manners.
Thank you, grandma.
Thank you, grandma.
Grandmother or Evelyn will do just fine.
There's so much more on there.
Things I know you'll find
really challenging.
Yes, but sadly it's a school night
and there's homework to do.
What a surprise though, right?
Say good night to Grandmother
or Evelyn.
Good night.
I'd kill a priest for a Benadryl.
Still with a allergies?
Why have you got a cat?
You don't even like cats.
Not my cat, it's Mary's cat.
I'm just along for a ride.
So let me guess, our lovely principal,
Miss Davis.
Never get on the bad side of small minded people
who have a little authority.
I thought I taught you that.
What are you doin' here?
You don't think I have a right to see
my granddaughter?
I do. I'm thrilled your seven year exhaust
of search...
has finally come to a fruitful conclusion.
I don't think this is appropriate time
to talk.
Certantly not the setting.
When I was waiting a cockroach this big
tried to steal my shoe.
Yeah. They'll take the shoe.
Honestly, this?
This god for sake mosquito ranch
was a conscious choice?
I could drop you back off at the
airport.
This thing is loaded with cool problems.
So, are you teaching?
I repair boats.
- Please.
- I'm not bad at it either.
Well, then, that explains this.
They don't sell sunscreen here?
I wear sunscreen.
Not enough. And you need a hat.
A big hat that shades your face and neck.
You're playing Russian roulette
with your skin.
- You look like porn producer.
- Okay.
I appreciate the advice. I do.
But we're not here to talk about
sunscreen, are we?
So no more small talk? That's a shame.
Okay, the enviroment you have
created for that child...
Where she lives, the school she attends
it's substandard. Every bit of it.
I disagree.
We're getting nowhere if we're
not being honest with eachother.
I am being honest.
I see. Fine. Well, I'm not leaving
without her.
Well, welcome to Florida.
Frank, please listen to reason.
At some point, are you gonna get to
conclusion...
or someone in authority are going to
spell it out for you...
that the child best interest is all that
matters.
You're gonna make me pull rank, I will.
Diane didn't want you to have her.
Diane...
Diane didn't always think things through.
Argue with propably one of the
brightest minds on the planet.
Good luck going down that road.
And what do you thin she'd say if she saw
how her child is living now?
Do you honestly think she'd be pleased?
That she's living somewhat normal life? Yes.
I do.
She's not normal. And threating her such...
is negligence on a grand scale.
I know your heart's in the
right place on this.
But you are denying the girl her potential.
I can provide for her. I can enrich
her life.
Come on, Evelyn.
You're gonna take that girl, you are gonna
bury her in tutors...
The you'll lown her out to some
think tank
where she could talk non-trivial zeros...
with a bunch of old Russian guys
for the rest of her life.
And you'd bury her under a rock.
Look, I didn't expect you to understand the
price you have to pay for greatness.
I do. That's why I have Mary in the
first place.
That's uncalled for.
Your sister had a laundry list
of problems.
She could have solved Navier-Stokes
and go down in the history
as one of the greatest mathematicians
of all time.
But she didn't, because she couldn't finish.
She was weak. Weak like a father
and weak like...
Well...
Now, if it's who I think it is...
Kinda puts a black cloud over our luncheon.
You're still stubborn and vindictive.
Careful, Mother.
There's an apple and tree
analogy lurking.
You guys ready to order?
Here's an idea.
Stop thinking about me and you...
and start thinking what's best
for a child.
For any reasonable person,
a clear picture will emerge.
If it doesn't, I suggest you call
your attorney.
He'll have a bucket of beer.
Let's go outside.
No.
Come on. It's nice out.
I don't care.
No more math today.
Is there a God?
I don't know.
Just tell me.
I would if I could.
But I don't know. Neither does anybody
else.
Roberta knows.
No. Roberta has faith...
and that's the great thing to have.
But faith's about what you think, feel.
Not what you know.
What about Jesus?
Love that guy. Do what he says.
But is he God?
I don't know.
I have an opinion.
But that's my opinion and
I could be wrong.
So why would I screw up yours?
Use your head.
But don't be afraid to believe in things
habit.
There was a guy on TV who said
there was no God.
The only thing different between
the things you saw on TV and Roberta
is Roberta loves you. She tries to help.
Tell you what though.
When we all one another,
we all end up back together at the end.
That's what you're asking, right?
Yep.
Okay.
Find something else to worry about, will ya?
All right.
Okay. Adler, grandmother and uncle.
Really?
Sure you folks don't wanna go on the hall
and settle this?
No? Well, that's a shame.
- Mr. Cullen, you're here for the uncle.
- Yes, I am, your honor.
Start charging you room and board.
Mr. Highsmith, you're on the wrong side
of a bay, aren't you?
I'm very happy to be here, Your Honor.
For the record, Mrs. Dibbons is
representing the state of Florida
Child Welfare Department.
Proceed.
Your Honor, my client Mrs. Adler
is the maternal grandmother of the child.
Her daughter, the girl's mother
was the troubled woman...
who seven years ago sadly took her own
life.
It was at this time that Mr. Adler
primitively and illegally took
custody of the girl and spirited her
across eight lines...
for the purpose of denying my
client custody.
And there's the evidence that the
child currently lives
in unclean and unwholesome conditions.
We petition to court?to grant my client
and full custoy of the child...
so that she can return to the state
of Massachusetts...
and given the care to which
she is entitled.
My client took an infant under his wing
for one reason only.
It was his sister's desire
that he do so.
My client has been her
constant caregiver.
And your Honor, as far as the living
conditions...
I've been in this home.
It's fine.
I mean, if we adopt standards based on
our friend's aversion to palmetto bugs...
we won't have a child left
side of Tallahassee.
All right, last chance before this starts
cost a lot more money.
Your Honor, my client would
need reasonable acess to the child.
So ordered.
Ms. Dibbons, would you go out and
check the living conditions?
On the books, Your Honor.
All right, folks.
Drive carefully.
Her lawyer has a nice suit.
Relax, Frank. More weight's
put on the talent competition.
Go have a cocktail.
Roberta, would you like to have
Mary tonight?
Why wouldn't I like
to have Mary tonight?
I told you something like this
would happen.
Now look where we are.
And I'm supposed to believe
you know what you're doing.
You couldn't even find the
white lawyer.
Look, just...
- Don't worry, okay?
- Don't tell me that.
There's nothing you can say that's
make me fell good...
because I have no say in any of this,
Frank.
I'm not a blood relative,
I'm not a legal guardian.
I'm nothing.
Just the lady who lives next door,
whose opinion means nothing,
whose feelings means nothing.
Would I like to have Mary
tonight?
I'd like to have Mary every
night.
d Can't stop me now d
d Hear what I say d
d My feet gotta move so d
d get out my way d
d I'm gonna have my say d
d I'm going to every discotheque. d
i'm gonna dance, dance, dance. d
d Till the break of day d
d Shame, shame, shame,
shame on you. d
d If you can't dance too d
d And I said shame, shame, shame d
d shame, shame, shame d
d Shame, shame on you d
Hi.
Hi.
I heard Davis bragging about
a custody case...
and the I found out who's
and I am...
I feel terrible. But I also wanted you
to know that after we talked...
I didn't say anything to anyone.
I swear.
And it's important to me
that you know that.
I know.
Okay.
My lawyer told me to get
drunk.
And you trying to do it
with that?
Okay. My turn.
Who was your first
celebrity crush?
I'll go with...
Mona from Who's the boss?
- Oh, wow.
- You know what I'm talking about?
- The sexy grandmother.
- Yeah!
I always felt like she
had a secret.
Yeah, which is that she loved
sexual intercourse.
That was it.
And she wasn't secret about it.
That's why I liked her.
You know what? I liked her too.
See?
All right.
Least favourite student.
And why.
Oh, no! I love all
my students.
I don't believe you. Not at all!
Not for a second.
No, they're all great.
They're all so great.
I'm gonna go ahead and drink.
Let's keep this honest.
He? She?
He is Ronnie Middleton.
Sounds like a dick.
- He's a little child, okay?
- I'm sorry.
The point is that he's evil
in his core.
And there's nothing I can do.
What's your greatest fear?
That's change of tone.
Yup. I am a really serious
person.
Okay.
Look, if it's too much, you can
just drink your drink.
And live with the fact that
you're afraid.
No, I can handle this.
That I'll ruin Mary's
life.
You're very...
surprising, Mary's teacher.
Very much so.
- Just. Hold on. I'm sorry.
- What?
Just so that...
I feel that I need to
say this...
Just there's no misconception.
No, I...
No, hold on!
That this can't,
isn't happening.
I get it. I know, I'm with you.
Yeah? Okay.
- 100%. We're on the same page.
Good.
No, that's great. I'm sorry.
That's embarassing.
It's okay. I get it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.
Okay. Good.
Can you promise me that
there's no way?
Yes. Roberta has Mary every
Saturday till noon, I promise.
Yeah?
Sorry.
I can't do this.
Okay.
Okay.
I understand.
I'll take you home.
Yeah.
Sorry, just... one more time.
I can't find my DVD.
It's right there, baby.
No, it isn't.
You come and find it.
I'm doing lady business.
And you were the last person
to watch it. What are you doing?
Oh, my God!
Good morning, Miss Stevenson.
Hi.
Look, I am...
You know what? i'm actually
incapable...
of having this conversation right now.
Good, good. Cause I have no idea
what I was going to say.
Great! Perfect!
Sir, if you please.
Take me to jail.
Awkward.
Mary...
Stop! Stop!
Stop with the Legos. Listen.
Do we have a rule about
Saturday morning?
What?
Are you allowed in this appartment
this early on Saturday morning?
- No.
- No!
Are you allowed to... Hey!
Stop! Enough with the Legos.
Are you allowed to use
Roberta's keys?
- No.
- No!
So, hey! Look at me.
Then why are you here?
Can you answer me that?
You broke every rule!
You just embarrassed me.
We have these rules.
We've gone over them a hundred times!
God!
Damn it!
Can I just get five minutes of my
own life?
Nothing that happened today was your fault.
I got mad at you...
I was really mad at me.
And the manufacturers
of Legos.
They should all be in prison.
So...
I'm sorry.
Do you forgive me?
Sure. Whatever.
Hey, close the laptop.
Come on.
Please. Doesn't count if it's
not eye to eye.
Come on, please.
Do you really have no life
because of me?
That's not what I said.
Did you mean it?
Last week you said I was the
worst uncle in the world...
and you wished the dead of me,
cause I didn't buy you a piano.
Did you mean that?
No.
Not entirely.
There you go.
We say things all the time
we don't mean.
let's forget it, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
- Frank?
- Yeah?
- Can I have a piano?
- No.
Was that really Mary's teacher this morning?
You know I have a book called:
Fundamentals of Decision Making.
You can borrow it.
What is it?
It's nothing.
It's like Mary gets to go to Boston
for a couple days.
It's just two days.
Relax.
So, what do you think?
Cool.
<font color=#FFFFFF>Wow! You and my mom...
were always together.</font>
Always.
Oh, no, you don't want to look
at that one.
Is that you?
Yes.
How old were you?
29.
Where is this?
That's Cambridge University.
In England.
Who are those people?
My research colleagues.
For what?
Mathematics, of course.
Really?
Cool!
So, then you came to work
at the college in America?
No.
I married your grandfather...
and I came back to America with him.
And I had children.
So, no more math?
It's late.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
Come on. Up, up, up.
Can I play the piano?
- No, you can't. Stop dragging those feet.
- But it's fun.
Come on.
I have had a series of nightmares...
where I'm fired...
because of what happened.
You get it?
And the I try to rationalize,
that everything that happened,
was just alcohol.
I have an addiction to fixer
guys.
Dr. Shankland, this problem is...
I know. Just copy it exactly as
you see it written.
But it's...
Exactly as written. Thank you.
So what's this problem I'm
supposed to look at?
I don't know.
So, it's like a problem
mom worked on?
Your mother didn't work
on problems.
She worked on just
one problem.
Just one?
Her entire life?
Most of it.
Look.
These are Millennium problems.
Seven great and meaningful
problems.
Some mathematicians have worked
their entire lives to prove them.
Who's the dude with the beard?
That's not a dude.
That's Grigori Perelman.
He proved Poincare
conjecture.
The only one of the seven
proved.
This...
This is your mother's
problem.
Na...vi...
Navier- Stokes.
No picture.
- She didn't solve it?
- No.
She was close.
She would have won
Fields Medal...
and probably shared the Nobel.
considering what would
meant for physics.
Maybe I'll have my picture
up here someday.
If you really desire it...
you can have your picture
there, darling.
I can help you.
It takes focus and hard
work, but if you succeed...
your name will live forever.
Don't be smug, Seymore.
Well, she's had plenty
of time.
She traveled yesterday, she
slept in a strange bed.
Give her a chance.
At six years old, she read Zimmer.
Outstanding.
How much did she comprehend?
So, Mary...
I see you're looking at
our little problem.
Little? It's big.
Yeah.
Why are you so mad all of
the sudden?
I'm not mad, I'm
annoyed.
Not with you, darlin'. With that
pompes ass, Shankland.
I knew that guy was gonna have
a beard, before we even went in there.
Math teachers like to grow
beards.
I should never have agreed
to this.
Did he reallly expect you to just
walk in and be able to dissect...
some random massive
problem?
Not much to dissect, if
you ask me.
Why? Why do you say that?
It was wrong.
What?
Well...for starters, he forgot
the negative sign on the exponent.
It went downhill
from there.
The problem was
unsolvable.
Maybe this school isn't as
great as you think it is.
Mary, you knew that the problem
was incorect, why didn't you say anything?
Frank says I'm not supposed to correct
older people.
Nobody like a smart-ass.
I'm loaded with swag!
Wanna come inside?
Cat.
Frank, I think this is stupid.
Why don't we just call Evelyn and
tell her I don't wanna do this?
Cause as I told you, Evelyn didn't
order this. The court did.
So again, what we are gonna do?
Tell the truth.
Exactly.
Sonner we answer these questions,
sonner we get to go home.
So, no attitude, okay?
Okay.
Frank?
Mary.
I like Evelyn.
She looks like my mom.
And she has a piano.
But I don't wanna live
with her.
She's bossy.
I've heard that.
Hey.
Don't worry. You're not going
anywhere.
Promise?
I promise.
Hi, Mary. I'm Pat Golding,
but you can call me Pat, if you like.
Got it.
Do you know why you're here?
I mean, is anyone told you
what this is about?
My grandmother wants me to live with her,
and I wanna stay with Frank.
That's correct.
I'm sure this is gonna be a very
scary stuff. Does any of it worry you?
Nope. Frank says I'm not going
anywhere.
Your uncle told you you're not
going anywhere?
Just 15 minutes ago.
So, are we done here?
Not quite yet.
My best friend other than
Frank and Fred is Roberta,
who lives a couple house away.
Really? What's she like?
She's nice and funny.
And I love her.
That's nice.
Is Roberta your only
friend your age?
Roberta's not my age. She's like
40, 50...
30-something.
Roberta's grown woman?
People my age are boring.
Roberta's cool.
Okay.
I don't watch TV.
But I got hooked on
SpongeBob.
Mostly because Roberta
loves it.
And on Saturday nights we watch
the UFC.
The UFC? Is that...
Is that Ultimate Fighting?
Every Saturday.
You and your uncle watch
Ultimate Fighting?
Well, you don't just
watch it.
Frank turns the sound down,
and we do grounting voices.
Sometimes I attack Frank
for real.
Which is really fun for me.
If you guys knew Frank,
you'd leave us alone.
He can be pretty annoying,
but he's a good person.
I think.
Why do you say that?
He wanted me before I
was smart.
Mr. Polland, are you the...
natural father of Mary
Adler?
Yes. Yes, I am.
And how you can be certain of this?
Well, I always knew, but
then you had me...
take a DNA test.
I would offer that the test results has
result of evidence of that...
Mr. Polland is the father and natural
guardian of the minor.
As well as an affidavit...
from Mr. Polland nominating...
Mrs. Adler the maternial grandmother
as the legal guardian of the minor.
No objections.
Mr. Polland...
has Mrs. Adler offered you any
moneytory reward or...
employment for coming forward today?
No, sir. I have a job of
my own.
Thank you. No further questions,
your Honor.
Mr. Polland...
when was the last time you
saw Mary?
I've never seen her.
Why not?
By the time I heard about Diane...
passing...
the baby was gone already.
Well, did you try and
find her?
Best I could.
I couldn't just go and search
the entire country.
Do you use a computer at work?
Sure.
You know what?
Help me out.
Let's google "Mary Adler"
and see what we find.
You know what?
You better add her middle name.
It'll narrow it down.
Eillen.
Yeah, Hit enter.
Page 2.
Second hit.
Would you please tell the court
what you see there?
It's a newspaper article called:
Not so terrible twos.
And one of them is Mary
Eileen Adler.
Same name as your daugter.
Born on the same day
as your daughter.
With a photograph.
In your defense, you'd
never recognize it.
- Your Honor, this is...
- Your Honor.
If there's one thing here
that's sadly obvious it's that...
Mr. Polland has never been a genuine
guardian of the minor
and his nomination of Mrs. Adler is
no less disingenuous.
While the state of Florida gets differents
to nomination by natural parent,
I'm inclined to side with
Mr. Cullen's laptop
at this time.
Thank you, your Honor.
Don't gloat.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Walk you to your car?
You been so proacipate,
I'm almost ashamed to ask.
How's Walter?
You wouldn't believe it
if I told you.
What?
Well, your stepfather is
in Montana.
He bought a ranch.
Bullshit.
Exactly. A man whose idea of
roughing it...
is being too far from the
ice machine at the Rith's Carlton,
now owns a 1000 acres of
grass and dung.
Walter Price is a cowboy.
Walter Price puts Brooke's brother
suit to take out the garbage.
He has a cowboy hat and
cowboy boots...
and a horse that doesn't know
dressage.
Is there some logical reason
for this?
Midlife crisis, apparently.
He's 70.
I know.
Must have been on time
delay or something.
I guess I should be happy it
wasn't 25 year old coctail waitress.
But than again in affair you can
explain to friends in a minute.
For this, you put on a pot of coffee.
And he's out there right now?
Yessiree!
Ridin' the range.
Punchin' doggies.
He had a six gun on
his hip...
and a saddlebag full
of Lipitor.
The fastest asset management
in the West.
The man who shot Liberty
Mutual.
That's what I've been
calling him.
That's really, really funny.
Take her to the airport.
Go home, Evelyn.
Or Montana. Rustle
some cattle.
You know...
I have no desire to
hurt you.
I hate it that we're
at odds.
We're always
at odds.
Yes.
Hotel.
Mary, baby, come on now.
Stop this. Stop this now.
No.
Come on out, honey.
No.
Why did you have to tell her
that Ted was testifying?
Because it's the truth.
And if I didn't,
Evelyn would've.
If I was the dad of a little girl
and I never saw her...
and I was in the same town...
I woull visit her.
Well, I hope you're happy.
He didn't even need directions.
He could've followed
you here.
Speaking of man who aren't
worth a damn.
Doesn't even wanna see what
I look like.
All right.
Put your shoes on.
We're going for a ride.
You too.
A ride?
What are we doing here?
Waiting.
We can see that.
Why?
Because I said so.
How long do we have to
stay here?
As long as it takes.
And keep your voice down.
It's a hospital.
- Food's here.
- Yeah, food is here. Okay.
It's a boy.
Way to go!
That's exactly how it was when you
were born.
This happy?
This happy.
Who came out and told everybody?
I did.
Can we stay for another?
Mrs. Adler, in your earlier
testimony here today...
you painted a pretty dim
picture of your son.
Don't you think?
I'm under oath.
I take no pleasure in it.
So, your son is failer in life,
your daughter took her life.
You know, you're oh for two.
- Objection!
- Withdrawn.
If I got one for three,
I'm in the Hall of Fame.
You know baseball.
Fanway Park.
You know, I'd like to go
there sometime.
How often in a year did
you take Diane to the baseball game?
Diane wasn't interested
in sports.
She never wanted to go to a game?
Ever?
I don't recall her ever
asking.
Just out of curiosity, Fenway,
that's a tough ticket.
Where do you get yours?
My husband has season tickets.
And how long has he
had them?
30 years.
But I've only been married
to him for 20.
And Diane never went to
one game?
What color was the dress Diane
wore to prom?
Diane didn't attend the prom,
Because she didn't attend the highschool.
No prom.
What sports did she play?
As I told you earlier, she
wasn't interested in sports.
- Did she go to camp during the summer?
- No.
- Community swimming pool?
- We had our own pool.
- Girl Scouts?
- No.
Then what did she do with
all that time?
She loved the mathematics.
It was her passion.
She preferred it to all
other things.
All other?
Mrs. Adler, who's
Paul Riva?
He was a boy from the
neighbourhood.
Oh, come on. He was much more
than just a boy from the neighbourhood.
Paul was Diane's first love.
Wasn't he?
I wouldn't caracterize it that way, no.
And how would Diane
caracterize it?
Diane was 17 years old at the time.
She didn't know anything about
love.
Mrs. Adler...
In January in 1989...
didn't Diane and young
Mr. Riva run away together?
He coerced her.
- And where did they go?
- Vermont.
- And you called the police, didn't you?
- Yes.
- Because he kidnapped her?
- Yes.
And where police found young
Mr. Riva and Diane?
I told you, Vermont.
Stowe, Vermont.
Wasn't it?
A resort town.
Stowe Mountain.
He took her skiing.
You see, kidnappers don't usually
take their victims skiing.
But this is what Paul did...
because he and Diane were
in love.
No.
And when they returned,
you pressed kidnapping charges.
you filed the lawsuit against
his parents...
until Paul stopped calling
Diane.
- Didn't you?
- Yes.
And Diane never heard of or
saw Paul Riva again.
Did she?
Not to my knowledge.
And how did she take it?
She was upset for a while.
She lost focus.
She lost focus.
Mrs. Adler, in March of 1999...
Didn't Diane Adler attempt to
take her own life?
This episode was minor.
It was nothing.
I have the hospital
report in my hand.
It was nothing.
Diane was not like
regular people.
She was extrodinary.
And extrodinary people come with
singular issues and needs.
You have no idea of capability
she possesed.
One in a billion.
And you would say: " Fine, let's throw that away,
so the boy who cuts our yard can make sexy concrest.
Well maybe before you make that
decision, you stand in my shoes.
I had responsibilities, which are beyond
the mother-dauther relationship.
The greateest discoveries, which have
proved life on this planet...
have come from minds rarer
than radium.
Without them, we'd still be
crawling in mud.
And for your information,
conselor...
a year after this incident with
this boy...
Diane thanked me for my
intervention.
She realized she'd made a mistake and
she thanked me.
You see, Diane understood. She's been a
contible for a gift she'd been given.
And she didn't shy from it.
And I think, if she were here today,
Mr. Atorney,
she would refute your baseless insinuations, that she
would give up her brilliant future and take her own life
just because her mummy didn't get
her a little red wagon.
No more questions.
Mr. Adler...
Where are you currently
employed?
I repair boats.
Oh, really?
At which marina?
I don't work at the marina.
I freelance.
So, safe to say, no health
insurance.
No.
About a week before your
sister took her life...
what were you doing for
a living then?
I was a teacher.
You're being modest, aren't you?
You were a professor at Boston University...
Isn't that right?
Yes, weel, assistant professor.
And what'd you teach?
Philosophy.
Truth and logic. That sort
of thing.
Your attorney said that the
primary reason...
that you took Mary is because what your
sister would've wanted you to do.
Is that a truth?
Yes.
So Diane chad visited Pinellas
County before?
No.
Indicated she wanted her daughter
rooted and moved here?
No.
No.
So you decided to bring Mary
here, didn't you?
Did Diane had a problem with your
health plan at Boston University?
Not to my knowledge.
Do you think she would want her
dauther to have access to healthcare?
Of course.
So what do you do, when a little
Mary gets sick?
You repair a doctor's boat?
Objection.
Sustained.
Mary has been identified as
a math prodigy.
But her formal math education
under your care...
She's learning at the first grade level,
isn't she?
Yes.
And you turned out the scolarship
at the Oaks...
a school specialized for the education
of gifted children?
Yes.
And Diane, she'd be fine with that?
I couldn't say.
Prody to Mrs. Adler giving her one.
Did Mary have a computer?
She used mine.
Mr. Adler, does Diane's daughter
have her own bedroom?
No.
Does she sleep in a bed that you bought...
- in a secondhand shop?
- Yes.
So, the truth is, Mr. Adler,
that you didn't come down here,
because your sister wanted it to,
and you certantly didn't come here
because it was good for Mary.
No, it was personal.
Diane was a star. You
weren't.
Diane got the attention.
You didn't.
Nobody use. You got angry.
And here comes Mary.
What a great way to get even.
You've uprooted that litlle girl and brought
her here for 1 reason only.
To do harm to your mother.
You blamed her for your sister.
No, I don't.
And Mary to you is just a paawn
in all this.
Diane wanted Mary...
to be a kid.
She wanted her to have a life.
She wanted her to have friends...
and to play...
and to be happy.
You realize the consequences of boredom
for a gifted child, Mr. Adler?
They become resentful and
sullen.
Mary's not an angry kid.
Really?
Did she not attack a child
on the school bus?
A 12 year old tripped a 7 year old and
she came to his defense.
- Did she brake the boy's nose?
- Yes.
On October 16th last year, were you
arrested for assault?
Oh, my God.
You have to answer the question,
Mr. Adler.
A drunk idiot attacked me and I
defended myself.
Did you spend the night in jail?
Yeah.
You are in way over your head here.
You're depriving that girl.
You're gambling with her future...
and now you being presented with
an opportunity...
- to do right by her?
- Does concil have a question for my client?
Take the high road, Mr. Adler...
- before she's rapidly damaged.
- Does concil have a question...
- for my client or not?
- Yes, sir. I do have a question.
Tell us. Is your continued guardianship
really in the best interest
of this litlle girl?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
I have no further questions.
Mr. Jim Emeliot has come up with
a brand new Fred cheer.
Fred personally asked me if I
would tell you it.
Let's hear it.
S-O-C-K-I-T Sock it to me,
Freddy...
Sock it.
Sock it.
Tell R and D, they got a winner.
That's exactly what I said.
S-O-C-K-I-T. Sock it to me,
Freddy.
They wanna cut a deal.
Highsmith called me first thing
this morning.
Why would he do that?
I don't understand.
Just listen. Listen to me, man.
- Mary would be put in fostering situation.
- No.
Come on, Frank.
- It wouldn't be a court-appointed foster family.
- Cullen, I told you no.
- Drop it!
- We can cherry pick...
from the cream of the crop.
Muturally approved.
Just hear me out.
Tampa.
I insisted, and they agreed.
No more than a half an hour
from your front door.
Now, she would attend the Oaks.
It's a great school.
And visiting rights for the grandmother,
but she was gonna get that anyway.
Right. And on her 12th birthday, Frank
she can go back into court...
- No.
- And decide then...
where she wants to live and who.
You supposed to be on my team.
Why are you bringing me this deal?
Other than I'm required to
by a law?
You like this deal?
I love this deal.
They think they're gonna lose.
Yeah.
They do.
You think we're gonna lose.
Yes.
I do, Frank.
I gotta go put my kids to bed.
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
But, if we leave this up to
that judge...
Nick knows, he's a old school,
Frank.
Does he like your mother? No.
Does he like her income?
Does he like her health plan?
Does he like her home?
You better believe it.
I've been in his courtroom.
A hundred times.
And if it's a coin toss...
Look at me.
If it's a coin toss...
that old boy is going
to side with the money.
So, do me a favor, Frank.
Just meet the family.
See how it feels.
It's all I ask.
d Fly away litlle prety bird d
d Fly. Fly away d
Pool. Florida.
- d Fly away... d
- That dock is on the Intercoastal.
- Which I guess is obvious...
- d Little pretty... d
- Since we're on the Intercoastal.
- d...Bird. d
- Added this desk, so she could do homework.
- d And pretty...
- Yeah.
- d And pretty you'll always stay. d
d I see in your eyes, I promise d
So, while I'm trying to sell you
on the house...
and us...
I just don't want you to think that
we're completely insesitive...
to what the feeling.
d But fly away little pretty bird d
You guys gonna be okay with the cat?
Absolutely.
d Loves own tender flame warms this
meeting. d
d And loves tender song you'll sing d
d But fly away... d
I've been thinking a lot about the
word called " compromise".
On one hand, good challenging scool...
on the other...
foster people.
They can watch sitcoms with her.
Take her to Olive Garden.
Teach her to say:
"irregardless."
The only saving grace is, I suppose,
that she is better off than she was.
Goodbye, Frank.
Come on.
I'm only 25 minutes away.
Please don't leave me here.
- Please.
- No.
You're going to a brand new school.
A better school.
I don't want to.
I want my crummy school.
- And you got Fred.
- Please.
And once a month you can come back and
stay with me and Roberta.
I want you and Roberta now!
And in a few years, if you want...
You can come back. You
can live with me.
I wanna stay with you.
Frank, you promised me.
- Come on. Don't do this.
- You promised me.
I know.
I know.
Please, Frank. Why are you leaving me?
Because the court said I have to.
You know this.
We've discussed this ad naus...
We've discussed this.
Come on.
- Come on. Please.
- No!
- Hey, Mary.
- No!
Hey, Mary.
No! No!
Sweetheart, you know what?
No!
There's no easy way to do this.
Not gonna be as long as
you think, honey.
- Frank.
- You're gonna see.
Frank!
Don't leave me!
- I know this is hard.
- Please!
- Come back!
- Mary! I know.
No!
Frank!
Don't go!
I need you!
Fred needs you!
You promised me!
No!
d Where the cold winter winds don't blow d
Hey, down there.
I don't know which mistake
is worst.
Designing a water pump that leaks
or putting it someone no human being can reach.
How you design something you
know it's gonna fail?
Gotta be devious or clueless,
right?
After the first few weeks, I knew
I had to find a real family for her.
I was in way over my head.
And every day I'd say:
"Today's the day"...
" I'm taking her to child services."
And every day she'd do
something just...
so unbelievably cool.
Her little personality was exploding.
She was funny.
And she was angry, and she was happy,
and she was...
Sad.
And was cute.
Just so damn entertaining.
And so I kept her.
Not that that's in her best interest.
Not that I'm capable of raising a child.
A child that might still have a mother if I'd taken
the time to notice she needed me.
And now, six and a half years later...
I finally got her to a foster family
and you know what?
It was great. She loved it.
I thought it would be a nightmare
of abandonment and betrayal.
And it turns out it was
a huge success.
I'm fucking hero.
- Frank...
- No, Bonnie...
I appreciate everything you've done.
Just...
- Hey.
- Hi, Frank.
We're having a little bit of a problem
in there.
What?
Mary's fine...
but she's having a little bit
of a meltdown.
Right. Let me taalk to her.
No, hang on.
That's not a good idea.
Your visit here is the reason
for the meltdown.
What?
She don't wanna see you.
I'm sorry, man.
This is predictable.
You know, she needs time.
Just give me 5 minutes with her.
I let you inside and then
we're gonna betray her trust and have
even bigger problem.
ADOPTABLE PETS
- Hi!
- Hi! Can we help you?
Yeah. Do you have a one-eyed orange
cat named Fred?
We have a one-eyed cat.
But I don't know what his name is.
Where?
I don't know. Today was his last day.
Hey, you can't go back there.
What are you doing back here?
I told him he couldn't.
Hey, Fred.
Who brought this cat?
Some guy. He said it was an allergy
issue.
Evelyn.
Frank?
- Where's Evelyn?
Evelyn? You mean your mother?
- Yes.
- Kevin.
Evelyn is in the guest house.
Yeah, listen.
I'm sorry, man.
Frank, let me tell you.
She was so helpful with the tutors.
- Mary was so distant.
- Hey!
Look, we know what you have against.
Do you want your life back?
Go back inside.
What are you doing here?
Come on, Mary. We're
going home.
No.
You're trespassing!
You need to look at this.
Let's go, Mary.
- Let's move. Come on.
- No!
- Hey, Mary!
- Mary!
It's okay. I got her.
Think again, lady.
A COMPLETE PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE
AND SMOOTHNESS OF THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION
Diane E. Adler
Mary!
Mary! Hey, stop it!
No, let me go!
No!
- No, no!
- Stop, Mary.
- Stop, stop!
- No!
- Come here.
- You lied to me.
I know.
- No, no!
- Stop, stop, stop!
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.
I'm so sorry.
You promised me.
I know.
You promised.
I know. I'm sorry.
You said you wouldn't leave me.
I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.
I was so sad!
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
They took Fred.
No.
It's okay.
I got him. He's home.
What?
He's at the apartment right now.
I got him.
For real?
Yeah, he's home kicking around his
ping pong ball.
Why did you leave me there?
Because I thought I was bad
for you.
And then it dawned on me.
If Mary is this amazing...
smart, sweet human being...
then I must be doing something right.
You're smilling.
Roberta!
Baby.
Of all the stunts you could pull.
- Where are they going?
- Nowhere. Not yet.
You two, out!
- What is this?
- Do you want to know...
how Diane told me she finished?
What is this unconscionable lie?
I walked in the appartment and she was
sitting on the floor...
with that baby in her arms and you know what she said to me?
- Admit it.
You made this up.
- She said: "What do I do now?"
- No.
. It's not a completed proof...
It is.
No! It isn't! It can't be!
Evelyn, stop!
I'm taking Mary and I'm raising her how I
believe Diane would have wanted it.
- We'll see about this later.
- I realize...
She's not normal, but if Einstein can
ride a bike so can she.
Let just say Diane didn't tell me,
which is nonsense.
It's a Millenium Problem. She would
have shared it with the world.
That's where your charade falls apart.
If she would completed the proof,
she would have published it.
Diane instructed me very clearly.
That I was only o publish it
postmortem.
She died six years ago.
It wasn't her death she was
talking about.
I tried to talk her out of it.
But you know how Diane could be
whenshe made her mind up on something.
I called MIT.
Shankland's out of his mind about the possibility
of publishing it with you.
He's waiting for your call.
You're gonna spend the next few years
of your life defending it.
You won't have time for her.
What If I say no?
Back to Plan A.
Wait for me to die?
I know Diane was hard.
I know she was angry.
But something really good came out of this,
Evelyn.
She needs you now.
You're the best woman for a job.
Take it.
It doesn't seem like Diane wanted
me to have it.
Diane didn't always think things through.
I'll be outside.
Let me know what you wanna do.
You reached the Apartment of Mathematics,
MIT.
If you know your part in extension,
you may dial it anytime.
If you wish to speak to operator...
please stay in line and someone
would be with you as soon as possible.
MIT Mathematics, how may I direct
your call?
Hello? I'm sorry. I can't hear
you wery well.
No! No.
Yeah. There you are.
Yeah, can I help you?
Yes.
Doctor Shankland.
I'm really sorry. I
can't hear you.
Could you speak up, please?
Hello?
Evelyn Adler...
for Seymore Shankland, please.
What I want you to notice is
when you compute P and N
for N congruent to four mod five...
the answer is a multiple of five.
The first person to notice this
was Romanujan.
In the beginning of 20th
century...
he proved that it was a case for all...
numbers congruent to four mod five.
So, he proved that P of five N
plus four...
is congruent to zero mod seven...
and P of eleven N plus six is
congruent...
Good?
You drive like an old lady.
It's Florida. I'm blending in.
How was school?
Fun.
Not like regular school fun.
But interesting.
What is this book?
Discourse on Method.
Rene Descartes.
What's it about?
Existence.
Existence?
Yup. " I think, therefore I am".
Well, of course you are.
That's obvious.
I think about Fred, therefore, I am.
Cogito ergo Fred?
He's a dude and he's a guy.
And he only has one eye.
Fred! Fred! Fred!
Freedy, Fred, Fred!
All right, here we are.
Hey, wait till I come to
a stop.
Then come to a stop already!
THE END
