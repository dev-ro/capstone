Poynter, with a y.
Poynter. What does this mean?
Good worker.
34th
I was born in 1954.
Third April 1955th
27th Last month.
In previous work I earned
$ 47 500. I can not go lower.
More than 40,000. About.
I am flexible.
Money? I'll buy?
This for me is not decisive.
I'm sorry.
If my life bitter compounds,
I called him just so
because I had a single problem.
You always have problems.
-I know.
I still have problems.
I really love them.
But without you
I do not take it.

Nothing is happening.

I want to go.
Fuck you.
I-Fuck? Oh, no.
Fuck you! In my house you.
Get out!

And arrogantly presumptuous.

to stop? No.
It can only do alone.
No one else.
Rather let's go inside.
