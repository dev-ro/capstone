Mogambo.. is pleased.
Daaga. Teja.
Use this money to spread
terror and devastation.
If terrorism,
devastation, destruction, riots..
..continue occurring
in India, then soon..
Next time, do your
homework on time!
''One, two, three.. four,
five, six..''
''..seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven.. twelve, thirteen.''
''One, two, three.. four,
five, six..''
If you love movies so much..
.. then learn this.
The Business of movies.
Once you learn this..
.. you can watch
them and screen them.
One day I'm going to be an actress.
And my movies will be
shown in your theatre.
Look! Someone got
your first autograph.
I'm drunk.. I'm hung-over..
With love.. waiting.
How should I be, o' restless heart?
My restless heart, please tell me.
I'm drunk.. I'm hung-over.
How could I have known?
You simply disappeared.
I changed my house.
Did you change your
relationships too?
You weren't around
when I needed a friend.
You didn't get married again?
I couldn't find you. Or
I would've married you.
Rahul. - Anjali.
We live once, die once..
..even marry once.
And we fall in love..
- just once.
Congratulations Kamal!
Your daughter's getting married.
- Thank you.
Quiet.
Stop this nonsense.
She isn't dead.
She's getting married.
''Tandoori Nights''. Play that one.
Why haven't you put the
flowers in Abhays room.
Come on, do it fast.
Aaliya!
I know you hate sentimental stuff.
Too bad.
Here goes..
Grandma gave me this ring..
For her daughter-in-law..
For you!
What a crappy dialogue, Gulati!
'Grandma's ring'? You serious?
Aaliya, grandma and grandpa eloped..
.. Even though no one had a
problem with their relationship.
The history of this
ring is very dramatic.
Al.. I love you.
So? Does that mean
we should get married?
Why are love and
marriage the same thing?
I mean, here's a
perfectly nice thing. Love.
Now let's destroy it..
Piece by piece.
Because if we don't get married..
.. what will PEOPLE say?
Al, you think I wanna marry
you 'cos of social pressure?
I want to get married for us.
For you and me.
I know what's gotten into you.
Your sister's wedding trumpets
have crawled under your skin.
Sorry, that can't convince me.
How about this?
I love how my mornings
begin with your voice.
'Cos you call for
something important like..
.. ''How do I
switch on the computer?''
And I love how passionately
you do all four of your jobs.
How you come to see me for an hour..
.. after tormenting me for fifteen..
.. just to say ''Gulati,
you're an idiot. Now kiss me.''
And I love the way
you shut your eyes..
.. and enjoy every
single bite.. from my plate.
And when my clothes smell of you.
Your hands on mine..
- Shut up, you idiot.
Let's elope right now.
And now we would've kissed.
But that would be weird..
.. 'cos I'd be kissing myself.
But, God, I am good.
Drag?
No! Smoking is bad for girls
Really? I thought
it's bad for anyone.
Men don't get pregnant.
- You're pregnant?
No. But.. I plan to.
Marriage at twenty two.
First kid at twenty three.
Second kid, three years later.
My plan was simpler.
Turn twenty and lose my virginity!
Thanks for tomorrow's headlines.
It's a wedding, Al.
Please take your 'chimney' away.
So your wedding smoke is
'devotion'.. And mine is pollution?
Hypocrite!
- Come on, Al.
And spare me your lecture
the cigar is for my play.
I have to look convincing!
But why are you
rehearsing when you are a smoker?
Hang on! A play?
- Street play.
Which means aunty Ayesha
definitely doesn't know about it.
Nope, 'cos she'll freak out..
.. the minute she
hears the word 'acting'.
It's just one show.
At Pragati Maidan.
No one will ever know.
But you do.
Just tell aunty and end the lies.
Stop compromising.
The amount you act in real life..
- Less than you.
'Born in his Papa's theatre..
.. and numbed to
death by it's boredom.'
Thanks for your
wisdom and sensitivity.
Screw sensitivity!
Uncle Jeet's theatre
business will be fine without you.
This is the Nth time.
- What?
Whenever I point out your problem..
.. you turn the spotlight on me.
But you started.. - But..
Since you won't
focus on your problem..
.. without discussing mine,
let's focus on me.
Let's say I tell dad I'm not
interested in his business.
Let's say he doesn't get multiple
cardiac arrests from this news.
What will I do then?
- That's the best part.
You'll find out, Gulati.
Let's travel. Let's be nomads.
Is this honeymoon ever
going to end? - Aunt Pammi.
When are you getting married?
We're thinking about it.
- Not thought about it.
Tell your babe that if
she continues like this..
..she'll stay single
like me. - Don't beat her.
If you're so desperate,
why don't you marry? - Rude!
I'm ahead of you by three divorces.
Can't help a quirky destiny.
Destiny is never quirky.
People are.
But aren't quirky
people the most fun?
Cigarette packets come
with a warning, people don't.
Doesn't stop you
from smoking, does it?
Wow.
So put your money where your
mouth is the altar's ready.
Get married.
Look, Ayesha is here as well.
Your mother still looks stunning.
See how she still affects people.
Here comes the superstar!
Still thinks she's a superstar.
See how their tails start wagging.
She still looks a million bucks.
Hi, Aunty.
- Hi, dear.
I love your sari.
But where is Aaliya?
Must be up to her
usual tricks somewhere.
Oh no!
What's the rush?
- Can't you smell it?
This henna smells so bad
it's affecting my brains.
Girls look happy with
henna on their hands..
.. 'cos they're
actually high on this dung.
Yonks ago if a lassie had not
this shite in her fair hands..
.. a laddie could carry her away.
Henna marked a woman betrothed.
What say thee?
Shall I abduct ye?
Who's stopping you?
Or will ye need steroids?
You've got competition.
The maiden is mine.
Lower ye eyes.
She's your sister.
Sis left.
They could've done a court-marriage.
Why are weddings such a circus?
Dumped another thing on her.
She looks like a clothes shop.
She's smiling.
''She's smiling.''
Some coma patients
also smile, stupid..
.. doesn't mean they're happy.
She's smiling 'cos no one
knows Jai is holding her hands.
They are celebrating the
biggest day of their lives..
..with the most
important people in their lives.
I can't see anyone important here.
I'm here for the free food.
The men are here
for the free whiskey.
And the women are
missing their TV serials.
Stupid.
There won't be a repeat
telecast of my sister's wedding.
And happiness grows
only when you share it.
Say that dialogue again.
Happiness grows only
when you share it.
Like a wild river..
.. she ripples without a care.
Like a gentle stream ..
.. he lets his silences sing.
Her fiery sands sting his feet..
.. like sunshine tickles rainy days.
You, my dear, are lost without me..
.. and I'm incomplete without you.
You, my dear, are lost without me..
.. and I'm incomplete without you.
'I love you, Gelato.'
- Hello, 'baby'.
Another fight?
Another slap?
'Sorry, baby.'
- 'Kiss me, baby'.
'Sorry, baby! Kiss me, baby!'
Buzz off!
Bye.
There are many ways to die, Al.
Then let's try this.
We'll die together.
She melts clouds in her hands..
.. and fills still
nights with laughter.
She melts clouds in her hands..
.. and fills still
nights with laughter.
So fearless, carefree
and thirsty for life..
.. I'm helpless
with her and without.
Are you a character from Saas-Bahu
(a popular genre on TV) serials?
It's sign of respect Al..
that comes from the heart.
Then I should take the
blessings of any elder.
Hello, Uncle.
- Bless you.
I hope you two get married soon.
Happy Diwali, sir!
So don't do it. It's
not an obligation.
I do it 'cos it makes ma and
papa happy. And that makes me happy.
If it made someone happy,
wouldn't you.. - Suffer spondylitis?
No way!
What's wrong with your family?
One cigarette, please.
I'm sorry we're so normal.
And not as 'cool' as you!
Perhaps we should all start
smoking 'cos that's so 'rebellious'.
That's it.
Al..
- Screw you, Gulati.
Superb idea!
He opens vials of
perfumes in her heart..
''I've searched for
love high and low.''.
.. and looks for
love-filled shells on sandy shores
He opens vials of
perfumes in her heart..
''I've searched for
love high and low.''.
.. and looks for
love-filled shells on sandy shores
He fills his world with love..
''The closeness of hearts,
the streams of desires.''
.. as she fills hers with dreams.
He was not flirting with me.
Yes, he was.
Trust me, I am a guy.
- You're jealous.
You're blind.
- What?
Can't a boy and a girl..
A boy and a girl can't
be 'just good friends'.
So if we break-up
we can't be friends.
Nope.
God, you're such an old-fashioned..
.. almost chauvinistic..
- You're an idiot.
I can't believe I am with you.
I am sexy.
You, my dear, are lost without me..
.. and I'm incomplete without you.
Like a wild river..
.. she ripples without a care.
Like a gentle stream ..
.. he lets his silences sing.
Her fiery sands sting his feet..
.. like sunshine tickles rainy days.
You, my dear, are lost without me..
.. like I'm incomplete without you.
You, my dear, are lost without me..
.. like I'm incomplete without you.
You, my dear, are lost without me..
.. like I'm incomplete without you.
I am Shah Rukh Khan.
This is probably the most disturbing
thing you ever said to me.
I am a star in
every scene of my life.
Okay.
What if you fail to
become an actor?
Lying to your mother..
Everything's going
to change Gelati.
Gulato?
What's your name?
- Sunita.
Sunita!
I have a sexy plan, Sunita.
But I'll tell you later 'cos I
don't want to lose the high.
Oh God! Another plan!
Sunita, you're so cute..
- What?
Stress makes you look cuter.
'Oh God! Another plan!'
I'm okay.
You're my stud, Sunita.
You can handle anything.
And you take advantage of that.
Don't say that.
You know I'm 'nonsense person'.
Understand, Sunita.
- Why?
Why should I understand?
Who argues?
- Me.
Who is stupid?
- Me.
Who is impulsive?
- Me, Your Honour, me.
Then why should I understand?
Who is older? You!
Who is mature? You!
Who is understanding? You!
Who is sensible? You.
So it's all up to you, Sunita.
You've to handle everything.
Because if you let go..
You complete me.
Shah Rukh, please!
I am the kite and you're my bread.
- Thread.
I fly and you let me go higher..
But as soon as you sense danger..
.. you pull me back.
What if the thread breaks?
Don't say that.
Ask the Thread Maintenance
Department to look after it.
It can't break, it can't break.
- I'll talk to them.
Promise?
- I promise.
'Cos I love flying a lot..
I can't help it. - I've noticed.
You know, I'm a USA.
UFO. - I know. Same thing.
So you'll stick around, right?
You won't let us drift apart.
Say it.. !
Sunita, where are you taking me?
- To bed.
I will never let us break.
I promise.
Hello. - Ayesha has started
her classic emotional blackmail.
So much melodrama..
It was a long shot. !
Didn't think I'd get in.
Al, calm down
She's so unreasonable.
She's been gone into
sentimental Overdrive.
Al, are you nuts? This is an office.
If she wasn't my mother,
I would've left home.
Shut up!
This is an office. People work here!
It's a loo actually.
What happened?
Good news, I've got admission here.
Bad news, Ayesha has flatly
refused my going to Gold Coast.
Just a sec! You're
going to Australia?
Obviously not. I want to,
but Ayesha won't let me go.
When did you apply?
Three months ago.
It was a long shot.
Didn't think I'd get in.
Thought I'd tell you both
about it.. - From the airport?
Abhay, I am already quite tense
I don't need your senti-crap now!
And I don't need two moms.
I am getting sentimental?
It's a one year course..
.. in another country
without telling anyone..
.. and this is your good news?
You're unbelievable.
I didn't tell you 'cos I
knew you would react like this..
There's a difference
between a plan and a decision.
If this was so important for you
why didn't you tell me before?
Why are you all so bloody emotional?
Gelato, understand!
Thought I'd surprise you guys
once the scholarship comes in.
I didn't think mom would react
badly to a Communications course.
And me?
I shouldn't react either?
I know. I'm sorry.
I knew you'd freak out, and so..
I freak out 'cos I'm always..
.. competing with
your lists and plans.
Where do I fit in your life, Aaliya?
Where do you fit in your own life?
Don't like what you're doing.
Don't know what you want to do.
And you've the nerve to tell me
that I shouldn't follow my dreams.
You're doing it again!
Instead of pointing out my flaws..
.. focus on your actions,
for a change.
I'm trying to.
You wouldn't be angry if
you understood 'focus'!
You're a boring
executive in your dad's office..
..who doesn't even know himself..
..and you're okay with it!
Where is the fire,
Abhay? What do you want?
I don't know.
But I'm not scared to
admit this truth. Unlike you.
Who's only solution
to problems is lying!
Because you can't hear the truth,
Abhay. You're too scared!
Try me, Al.
- Fine.
You don't have a life.
I am your life.
Your life shouldn't be disturbed,
and to hell with mine!
I'm not your 'love'. I'm your habit!
You're actually defending this?
You're lying and telling
me I don't really love you?
You're pathetic.
- And you're delusional!
You've decided to go to Australia..
So your mom and I
should just 'deal with it'!
To hell with our feelings.
- What about my feelings?
You don't have any.
You're just a
selfish programmed robot.
You couldn't
communicate with two people..
.. and you want to do
'Mass' Communications.
So you think he's unambitious,
unhappy..
.. and lacks focus.
And his problem is that you're..
.. over-ambitious, you
focus on everything..
.. except him.
And you know what?
I see his point.
You two should
seriously get married!
What a pair!
You're casually joking
about this 'cos you know..
.. how committed he is towards you.
No matter what, he
will still love you.
I need some space from that love.
- Bravo.
Spoken like your dad's daughter!
Dad cheated on you, ma!
And what did you do?
Lied to me, as usual.
For what, Aunty?
A silly course. A year long course.
Stop whining!
Telling you late is not lying!
She's no saint but
she's independent.
So let her be. Why
does it bother you?
Why cook for an army over this?
Aaliya is independent, adventurous..
.. wants to experience everything.
And I love that about her.
But that's what's
throwing me out of her life.
And she's okay with that.
What's wrong with that?
I want to travel. See the world.
Live on my own, free as a bird.
Are we threatening your freedom?
Buddy boy, go or not..
If she's even thinking about going..
.. one thing's for sure.
Are you breaking up with him?
She wants to act!
And Acting is the most
popular course of that college.
I'm sure you noticed that.
This is just an
excuse to get out of here.
When Aaliya was six..
.. she convinced her teacher
that she couldn't do homework
As her actress mom
couldn't pack her lunch-box..
.. and Aaliya had to do
all her chores herself.
Just to escape homework!
You know what?
If I was Aaliya's teacher..
.. I'd have bought
the story as well.
Aaliya is that good.
These small lies are just a
rehearsal to become an actress.
She thinks it's fun.
Who knows what she
might do in Australia?
She hasn't seen the real,
ugly side of this world..
.. which I have.
I was married to it.
There are all sorts of
people in this world..
.. notjust one's like Al's dad.
She will make mistakes.
And she has a right to.
How else will your
stubborn daughter learn?
The blemish is inside, not on it.
Let it be.
That's what makes it unique!
Aunty has one condition.
Only Communications. No acting.
Al. I'm doing a boring
job in my dad's office..
But I'm not lying to myself.
I know. I'm sorry.
But..
- I know.
I don't want to lose myself either.
Take a risk, Gulati.
You're the smartest guy I know.
If you stay so safe..
- You balance that..
.. Risk-taker!
You're even risking us.
Are you mad? What risk!
Aren't we still together after
yesterday's record-breaking fight.
A year's break won't
make any difference.
What 'break'?
Don't be an idiot.
Being apart for a year
is an obvious break!
Al, one doesn't apply for
'casual leave' in a relationship!
Are you breaking up with me?
No, you sentimental freak!
Don't complicate it.
This is not a break-up,
this is just a little.. break.
What does a 'little break' mean, Al?
Think before you answer.
Do you know what a
'little break' is?
No, but I know that we need it.
We need to find ourselves.
I just hope we don't lose each
other while finding ourselves.
We won't.
You won't let it happen.
Don't lose hope, Gulati.
What are you thinking?
It's time to fax the
'Thread Maintenance Dept.'
Don't lie, I know
you're missing no one.
Met your aunt yet? - No, but
she's lived in Oz for twenty years.
Besides, mom's sister
is bound to be cool.
Ayesha first spoiled you
and now she's regretting it.
Had you come to me earlier
she wouldn't be ruing this day.
What's wrong with this day?
You don't like Tuesdays?
No boys, no late-nights.
And no phone calls after eleven.
What?
I need to pee. Shall I hold or wait?
And finally a whiff of fresh air..
.. as our bound arms
stretch themselves.
My heart wants to hum..
While he wants to sing..
I smile, he giggles..
.. powerless
against this crazy whim.
Distances are important too.
Sometimes you gotta chase space.
Distances are important too.
Sometimes you gotta chase space.
Distances are important too.
Sometimes you gotta chase space.
She said my skirt's
too short! Change it.
Imagine! Even Ayesha
never said this to me!
But why are we discussing her?
- Thank you.
The kids were
missing you today. -Who?
The kids we meet at the signal, Al!
You've forgotten them already?
- Don't be silly.
Hey, if I murder my aunt..
.. where should I hide
her body? -Al, please.
Can we please talk
about something else?
I have to live with her,
Gulati! -So do I.
Gelato, guess what?
Your aunt is wearing a bikini
and head banging in the campus.
I was not talking about her.
Sometimes you're more
irritating than my aunt!
And we're back to your aunt!
Alright. We'll talk about aunt only.
Such intimacy sows
seeds of distances..
.. don't be fooled,
these waters are not sweet.
Look but don't touch; its fire..
..just watch it shimmer from afar..
..any closer and you could burn..
..powerless against this crazy whim.
Distances are important too.
Sometimes you gotta
chase space. - Hi, guys.
Hi, I'm Rishabh.
- Hi, Aaliya.
You were really good today.
- Thanks.
God, my aunt.
Gotta go, guys.
It's 10 O' clock.
She could've called me.
I don't know what to do with her.
She just walked in.
Ayesha, I agreed to house my niece,
not to become part of local gossip!
She thinks it's ok to be
wild 'cos this is Australia!
Has no respect for elders.
It's called survival, Gelato.
So what?
This isn't India, it's Australia.
It's a bench in Australia.
Sounds really adventurous.
Look, dad has a
partner in Melbourne..
Ah! So I should leave
one dictatorship and..
..enter another rulebook!
Know what? Why don't I
just come back home?
Why explore the world, right?
Please don't do that.
Who will do the other
courses in the world?
Like the one in Switzerland,
on Snow Management.
Screw you!
We've been arguing for over two
months! I'm sick of this shit!
I'm.. sorry, I don't want to fight.
I just want to help you.
Let's not talk for a few days, ok?
How will that help, Al?
If we don't hear
each other's voices..
..we'll have very little left?
No, Gulati.
It'll make us stronger.
Ok. Let's try this as well.
But you're a 'nonsense person'.
Bye, sweety.
I love you, sweety.
I've never felt so
pathetically poor.
Who can afford 200 dollars a month?
I'm screwed, man.
Hey, I have an idea!
You can stay where I live
if you pay advance rent.
Six hundred for six months.
Sorted!
What?
- Yup.
That's awesome. Thank you.
Did you leave this pink
toothbrush in my bathroom?
What?
- I did.
Good. Come.
Last night was sensational.
- Deja vouz!
That's yours.
That's the way. Don't call.
I'll call or not.
Were there the two of
you last night? - No, I'm..
No one cares who you are.
Get out.
- Excuse me?
Are you dumb and deaf? No
one gives a shit who you are!
She needs to take a shit!
But.. -Why aren't you at the shack?
I wasn't in the mood.
I'm in the mood to cut
your wage. -Just a sec..
You can't cut your
elder brother's pay.
Bite me!
You work for me. I own that shack!
Don't make me angry, Cyrus.
You're Cyrus? Is this your house?
Wow! Ms. India has brains too.
She's not your type.
And you
- that's called a door..
.. and if you lift those two,
you might discover walking.
Excuse me.
Or we can do something
else with them. - What?
This is not a freaking motel, Cy!
Thanks, that was butt ugly.
Freaks, I'm Aaliya..
Rishabh sent me here.
- Aaliya.
Why didn't you say that earlier?
He finally got a hot babe.
We were expecting you..
- I'm not his babe.
Sorry about the confusion..
got the rent?
600 dollars.
- Are you single?
What? - You'll need to
learn to ignore my brother.
Can I feel that butt?
I've handled bigger sleazes in
Delhi buses. You're nothing.
Nads.
- Yes.
What's a 'sleazoid'?
Oh, by the way. I am Nadia.
Hi.
- This feels good.
Spank me while you're at it.
Our house.
The beach bed.
Our beach shack.
Where we rent out surfboards. Cyrus!
My real talents emerge at the bar!
Nadia likes pain.
And your room.
If you need anything..
don't tell me.
It's perfect.
Distances are important too..
Sometimes you gotta chase space.
Distances are important too..
Sometimes you gotta chase space.
Distances are important too..
Sometimes you gotta chase space.
Let me see.
Why don't you just tell your parents
you don't want to get married.
You don't know them.
It's easier to get married.
No, it's easier to get laid.
Let's Party, you losers!
- Party!
Gelato! !
- How are you?
Thirty days and thirty hours.
Not bad, huh!
Can't hear a thing, hang on..
Move your ass!
I'd love to, but..
who's dying behind you?
It's Cyrus. He's nuts!
I'm in an amazing place.
My room is sea-facing!
I'm living in a private island..
for just six hundred dollars!
That's.. cheap, right?
-Super cheap. And for six months.
Six hundred for six months?
Sounds too good to be true, Al.
You doubt so much, Gelato.
Why so serious?
Why's everyone screaming,
What kind of a party is this?
It's unbelievably crazy!
We've been partying for two days.
It's Rishab's farewell
party and everyone's smashed!
Enough about me. How are you?
Same shit, different day!
Who's Rishab?
A sexy stud! Happy?
We're all friends and live together.
Chill, Al. I haven't
heard your voice for a month.
You've made new friends.
Let's get naked!
Who.. hate their clothes,
New place, new friends.
It's natural, Gulati.
Don't assume what
you can't see is shady!
Know what? I don't want to argue.
You want me to understand your
life after you throw me out of it?
What are you doing, Al?
Why are you fighting ?
I'm taking a break.
Hello?
Damn!
Look, fighting will
not help anything..
Buddy..
You're in a long queue here!
You're in queue!
I just need.. a break.
Six in the evening?
What the..
Thank God for small mercies!
O' what a beautiful.. Hello! !
Congratulations!
- On?
On finally getting some action.
- What?
Look at her, dude.
She has more
facial hair than Rishab.
Why do you think
he brought you here?
For some 'lurve'.
Just wanted a piece of heaven..
.. before he spent the
rest of his life in hell!
You asshole! Get up.
I thought you were a friend..
I'll cut your..
Into so many pieces..
.. you'll never be able to have sex
Hang on.
- Shut up.
Listen..
- How could you even think about..
I'm going to kill you.. !
- What happened?
Gulati, what the
hell are you doing here?
Looked cute, so I let him in.
- What!
Did you touch her?
- He's your boyfriend?
Abhay, stop it. Spank him harder.
Did you touch her?
- I don't remember.
What?
- You asshole. 'Don't remember'!
There's nothing to remember.
- What did he do?
Gulati, nothing happened.
What's a 'Gulati'?
- I knew something was wrong.
Now he would be able
to touch any girl again.
He's running away.
Stop recording, man!
- Come in.
This is so going on You Tube.
How'd you get here so soon?
We just spoke today.
We spoke yesterday, Al.
And five minutes later, a
drunk man picked up your phone ..
.. and told me to ''get in line''.
But I told you to back-off.
Why call in the first place?
Why can't you deal with this break?
Break doesn't mean..
And what the hell does
a 'break' mean anyway?
It means she's dumped you! !
I was so hoping you
wouldn't feel insecure.
''Don't help me. Don't
discuss my problems.Don't call me.''
You have a problem with everything.
Your only response is fear.
You do that to people, Al.
Your mom found out two days
later that you're not at your aunt's.
She was so freaked out.
- Don't drag Ayesha into this.
She didn't come running here.
'Cos I keep
telling her to trust you.
Since you got here..
- Don't start.
You're here 'cos you've got issues.
We have issues, Al.
You're so blinded by your dreams..
I don't want to deal
with your problems.
This is it. - You don't want
to deal with our problems.
You're not taking a break,
you're running away.
I am breaking up with you.
You don't mean that.
I do.
I can't do this anymore.
One little problem and
you throw it all away?
That's your quick fix?
And so easy for you to do?
It's become so complicated
that nothing else can be done.
It's not complicated, it's
just inconvenient for you.
You don't want it, right? Fine.
But I won't accept it.
We're not over just
because you say it's over.
Just let it go, Abhay!
We can't be over when
you snap your fingers.
Relationships are built by
togetherness, not space!
Your priorities have changed,
not mine.
We will fix this.
Until you come back to your senses..
.. and listen carefully
for I mean every word..
I'm NOT going anywhere!
I'm staying right here.
You've lost it, Abhay.
And what do you mean by ''here''?
Where will you stay?
- Stay here, dude.
What?
- What?
I like you.
- Really?
Nads, I got here first,
I've paid advance rent.
Not in a man-love way.
I just.. 'like' you!,
He ain't leavingjust
'cos you say so. So chill.
When's your flight?
- Tomorrow.
And we don't want you to miss it.
So you can spend the
night at the airport.
But..
- What?
Advance rent.. ?
- Six months, I know.
I'm Abhay.
- Nadia.
And I am the retard.
No. No, no, no.
One second. You and I can't
live under the same roof..
Why not? - Because.. - I'm
your EX-boyfriend, right?
Know what? You're right.
Please stay here.
But we're so through.
My stuff?
I'll take it later.
Lose unwanted weight.
Make your body look attractive.
Pick up the phone and order now.
Telemall's Home Jogger.
Either you're really
stupid or really blind.
''Gulati, what the hell
are you doing here?''
One day, I gave a girl my word..
.. that I will never
let us break apart.
And I intend to keep my word.
Say goodbye to obesity, but not us.
We will return with
this unique invention..
.. after a short break!
You're up early!
What's the time there?
Eight in the morning.
That's funny, even here..
My neighbour's a strange girl..
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.
My neighbour's a strange girl..

My life's in a strange phase..
..And teases in strange ways.

Shit!
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
How about some breakfast?
Not your credit cards! !
Have you lost it?
It's not worth it, dude.
Not for a girl.
Go on, Abhay, do it.
Don't listen to her.
She doesn't even believe in love.
I believe in respect. Screw love.
Well done!.
Last one.
Dude!
Such a cruel thirst, I see
but not sip this water..
..I live my dreams in
such a cruel reality.
A strange possibilities,
they open a window..
..only to cast a stranger view!
Yes, he's 'sweet'! Should
I make a candy out of him?
This drama has gone
on for two months!
Breaking up was easier.
Nothing's difficult,
aunty. She's just a bit miffed.
But I have a plan.
See each other's point of
view instead of fighting.
I'm trying to do that.
That's what I'm doing,
- No, not you, son.
Stop yelling, Aaliya.
I'm not yelling.
I'm trying to make him see..
- That's it..
..it's a pointless fight.
I don't know what he wants.
- I know what she wants.
Get off the phone.
What's your problem,
Why're you calling Ayesha?
She's my mom.
My mom, my life, my house, my..
..and your room too.
Hello!
What are you doing here?
I'm taking a RISK.
Didn't you say people could
never be friends after a break-up?
Correct. But this is a
break-up only for you.
For me it's..
- A challenge!
''How can this happen to me?''
''I've even chosen our kids' names!''
Babies?
Nonsense!
I know the
responsibility of world population..
..lies on your delicate shoulders.
We'll plant trees!
And now she walks away
to lead her secret life..
..so don't forget your script!
Al..
- Don't.
Extra rent for babies and trees!
The ocean has
erased our footprints..
..and a stray breeze
sprinkles nostalgia over me.
Strangeness is all around..
..it's raining moon and stars.

This month's rent.
Have you seen your face?
Actually, no.
You look like crap.
Nads, nothing you
say can make me feel..
She doesn't love you.
Round one to Nads.
So we should love people
only till they love us back?
No, Nads. You can't marry him.
Nad's dude cheated on
her and since then..
Butt out, Cy!
Just take it.
Just get some real clothes.
She really likes you, bro,
'cos she never refuses money!
She loves money.
- Our dead parents' money.
And I own half of it.
You will, once you get
out of this beer can..
So how long were you
guys together for?
Ten years.
Ten! One girl! One girl! Disgusting!

Brother Javed.
What's the menu today?
Mutton curry and bread.
Very funny!
Try some!
Come on. Come on.
Thanks.
Come on.
Hey.
- Hi.
Two.
Thank you.
Hey.
- Hi.
Nads, want one?
- Sure.
No.
Last month's debt, this and
the next two months' rent.
Slow down, Mr. Gates.
Thanks, guys.
Keep it!
What? Enough of this shit!
Who made you the
decision maker on the rent?
Is he in love or are you?
It's business, Cy.
I keep the shack deposit.
The rest is the
start-up cost for you two.
Who two?
You two.
That's your kitchen
area from tomorrow.
Your talent, your investment,
my place.
Cy's the manger.
Profit splits three ways.
Deal?
I need a beer.
I won't ask again. You in?
Yes. Yes.
Why are you doing it?
'Cos she loves money.
And she hates me.
This is not business, Nads.
Someone should have a happy ending.
Congratulations.
Hi.
- Aaliya Khan.
Yes?
Daniel Trip. I'm the
casting director on a film.
We need an Asian actor.
And you're good.
Auditions have begun
and are on for two weeks.
Congratulations
for tonight. Call me!
Come on, girl, smile.
You gonna call him?
Surprise!
Happy birthday, Al.
How can you forget
your own birthday?
It's called old age.
Your momma's old!
I love dirty talk in Hindi.
You guys baked me a cake? How sweet!
Aunty made it.
He's the cook, I'm the manager!
That's the deal.
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday, dear Aaliya!
Happy birthday to you!
Come on.
Hey! Stop it!
Good night, see you tomorrow.
- See you.
Thanks.
I completely forgot my birthday.
You're welcome.
What's up?
Nothing.
Al, something's wrong.
I'm.. Nothing.
Come on.
Abhay, can you forget
everything for five minutes?
We were never dating,
we never broke up..
..we're just Abhay
and Aaliya. Friends.
No expectations, no complications?
What happened?
I met a casting agent today..
..he's offered me a film.
It's big.
- That's great.
Oh, no.
- I know.
Your mom.. Most actors
don't get this chance.
And I don't know when I
would get such a chance again..
You're not sure
what's more important.
Acting or your promise to your mom.
I'm a jackass!
Why did I make that promise?
I thought I am getting to do a play,
Ayesha will never know
- it's perfect!
And now I get a damn International
film in Oz of all the places.
This doesn't even happen in films.
What do I do now?
Speak, Gelato.
Follow the beat of your heart!
- Meaning?
Why are love and happiness
different things for people?
You were right, you were my life.
Not that again..
Hear me out, Al.
I was insecure 'cos I didn't
know how someone could be..
..so passionate about their dreams.
But I do now.
I stood between you and your dream.
I made you choose.
That's not love.
That's selfishness.
Aunty Ayesha will understand.
Like me.
I didn't celebrate
your admission, did I?
Let's do it now.
Let's get a beer.
Actually..
Let's celebrate you first.
Why?
'Cos you found your dream, Gulati.
For the first time
you look happy working.
You always looked good in an apron!
Did you tell your dad?
I'm following the beat of my heart.
He'll understand too.
Chef Ramsay!
I missed you.
My only friend in the world!
So the vixen is softening.
She's bound to.
If a boy crosses seven seas to
woo her, any girl would melt!
It's too loose!
- Get her some boobs!
When are you coming back?
I don't know, Aunty.
But I will return with Aaliya.
No, Nads, we're just friends.
Finally we are un-complicated.
Love, relationships, hurt..
..one should leave
these for old-age.
It's too much.
Shut up, Cyrus.
Actually, you're a genius.
It's simple.
Love was getting complicated,
so you broke up.
Then you felt all alone..
..and became friends again.
Perfect! - Exactly.
And Abhay thinks he's..
- An ATM machine.
He gets no deposits, you
get to make withdrawals..
..of his heart, mind or time..
And the best part?
Machines don't expect anything back.
You're being sarcastic, right?
And this is why you're a genius.
''I love you.''
''It's so difficult to
spend days and nights.''
''There's just one thing
I want to say to you.''
She's smoking!
Gulati wanted to marry
her when he grew up.
I was ten, guys.
Hey, are you coming on
the 10th for my graduation?
Okay, good news! My new restaurant..
Our restaurant!
Our new restaurant
has found an investor!
Bad news! Meeting's on the 10th.
- Gulati.
Didn't tell you 'cos I
knew you'd freak out!
Don't friends fit
into your plans anymore?
Not fair!
You used to make
time for me earlier.
Not fair!
Yes, I've packed the pickles.
Hang up and save your money.
You're arrivingjust a
day before my graduation.
Abhay and Cyrus have a meeting.
Nadia has to manage the Shack.
Nobody loves me.
Why couldn't you come earlier?
I need to discuss
an important thing.
What happened?
We'll talk face to face.
It's kind of big.
Your ''big'' is usually a ''big bomb''.
You know I don't like surprises.
But..
- Aaliya Khan.
Just a second.
Gotta run, ma. Bye.
Nervous?
- Not at all.
Good, 'cos you can nail it.
That's what I'm nervous about.
And now we've reached the
end of another academic year
Congratulations, class of 2009.
You are all now graduates.
That's it Ayesha. No more courses.
I'm fed up of studying.
Thank God!
So what's your big surprise?
You've kept me in
suspense since yesterday.
Yes, I..
Gulati!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Have you told her yet?
I'm shitting bricks!
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
You know how she is.. -Yes.
Don't give her less
credit than she deserves.
Hey..
''I'll be right
here waiting for you!''
Chill! It's just an offer..
..it's not like
you've signed a contract.
Al..!
- So that's your big surprise.
Congratulations, aunty.
Congratulations to you too.
I'm happier about this
than your graduation.
I knew it. This
break-up wouldn't last long.
But how did this happen?
And please don't
take an eternity again..
..get married soon.
Marriage? Where did that come from?
Even Abhay's managed to move on.
Aaliya.
Abhay, tell her that
we're just friends.
We're just friends.
Gelato, are you..?
We're just friends.
So what was your news?
What was the surprise?
Mother, I..
Promises, commitments, feelings..
..these things mean nothing to you.
Don't pretend to ask after
you've signed the contract.
I don't mind your having dreams..
..but I mind that our feelings are
nothing but hurdles in your path.
People don't love you
because you're special Aaliya.
You're special because a few people
in this world love you immensely.
Sometimes, despite the way you are.
And today you proved
how foolish they are!
I didn't want this.
I just..
- You can't expect everything..
.. and not expect to get hurt.
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to hurt you.
When we broke up, I refused
to accept it as a possibility.
I didn't believe you.
That was my fault.
You did move on.
You're lucky you can.
Goodbye!
- Gulati?
I'm off.
Rain.. It will wash it all away.
Lit up, you'll see it,
a whole new way.
Slowly, yesterday will ebb away..
Slowly, making way for a new day.
Like a roof of sunlight..
Like a slip-sliding road..
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.
Like a roof of sunlight..
Like a slip-sliding road..
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.
''If you believe, sun is shining,
love is lighting your way.''
I'm sorry. And
thanks for everything.
Drops of realisation
trickle down on me..
I'm haunted by a
thirst from before..
But I see new clouds dancing above..
..kissing my forehead,
with drops of love.
Letting go.. it is time, I know.
Seasons have changed in a burst.
I take a small step,
perhaps my first.
Like a roof of sunlight..
Like a slip-sliding road..
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.
I didn't choose my dream, ma..
..it chose me.
But I will not lose you for it.
I will walk towards but
only with you beside me..
And if you aren't
ready to stand by my side..
..then I'll wait.
But I won't do this without you.
I won't leave you alone like dad.
I am so sorry, Aaliya.
Your dream wasn't wrong, dear.
Your means were callous.
How much dough do you need
for the kitchen expansion?
Wow, did we make a profit?
- Buzz off.
Nice.
Now Cyrus will go on a holiday..
.. after which you
will expand the kitchen.
No one will touch this money.
We're going to
open a new restaurant.
The Investors loved
our restaurant plan.
The paperwork will be done tomorrow.
Are you serious? We got funding?
Does that mean I can now..
- No, Cy.
I hate you guys.
Absolutely.
It was my idea to open an
Indian restaurant. - Hi, Cy.
Here is my partner. Gelato Gulati.
Congratulations, man!
Houseful on the first
day itself. - Thanks, man.
No free drinks.
Abhay.
Nice place.
Abhay, had I known
you're so talented..
..I'd have thrown you out years ago.
I'm sorry, Papa.
I didn't tell you earlier
'cos even I didn't know..
Abhay, my dream wasn't that
you'll learn to manage my theatre..
..but that you'll
learn to manage your life.
My dream's come true.
You're finally on your feet..
..earning as well.
So you and Aaliya..
No, Papa.
We won't discuss that.
That topic is closed, please.
Fine, let's talk
about something else.
Why.. don't you get married?
She's cute.
And she'll turn eighteen soon.
Happiness hung from
a branch so elusive..
..but I leaped and
caught its fragrance.
So fragile, but we
inevitably slipped..
..but I will heal, I
will rewrite my script!
I can see the shore,
I see the light..
..new stars wink at me from the sky!
The flight's day after tomorrow.
Next Monday flight to Gold Coast.
By the time I realized
that my parents are right..
..my own daughter was standing in
front of me telling me I was wrong!
I was trying to protect you from
making the mistakes I had made.
But I forgot.. you're not like me.
You're much stronger.
Still have a knack for dialogues!
Why'd you quit acting?
Go back, Aaliya.
Follow your heart.
Like a roof of sunlight..
Like a slip-sliding road..
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.
Like a roof of sunlight..
Like a slip-sliding road..
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.
Like a roof of sunlight..
Like a slip-sliding road..
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.
Like a roof of sunlight..
Like a slip-sliding road..
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.
Like a roof of sunlight..
Like a slip-sliding road..
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.
Come on, Aunt Pammi.
You know I'm not
interested in marriage.
So why should I meet any more girls?
'Cos that's the only way!
Just meet them, then say 'no'!
Oh, please..
Is this seat taken?
Are you meeting a girl?
A beautiful babe.
Can I go now?
- Don't ever call me that.
She sounds like a vixen too.
Bye aunty!
I can't believe the
restaurant's completed a year.
Happy anniversary.
- Yes, whatever.
Everything began in
this shack. Thanks..
I owe you guys everything, or I'd
still be rotting at the taxi stand..
..and Cyrus would be
rotting in a beer can.
We're even!
No one owes shit!
A toast..!
To Cyrus..!
Who achieved nothing
in life, till today!
This restaurant is my first..
- And sole!
And soul milestone.
Well done, Cyrus.
Cheers!
What's a 'soul'?
What you can only hope for.
Surprise!
- Surprise!
She's shooting a film here.
Aunty Ayesha agreed.
Why dredge up what's over..
- Just a minute.
Have you been on a single
date after your break-up?
This isn't over yet.
Hi.
Hey.
I told Nads that maybe I
shouldn't.. - It's fine.
How are you?
I'm good.
Thank you.
Let's end this awkwardness,
I'm not good at it.
I just came to say..
- Al, it's fine.
No, let me say it.
I just came to say that..
- Al, chill.
I'm glad you're here.
Gulati, I need to say this!
I just want to say that
I'm really happy for you..
I'm very proud of you and..
..I'm sorry.
I'm really very sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
So how many
restaurants do you own now?
Two and a half!
Two in Gold Coast and
one in papa's theatre.
Wow!
So you finally told him.
He must be so proud of you.
Last year's been so hectic..
- One year and forty days!
When did your memory improve?
I remember everything.
- Really?
I was thinking on the flight..
..when we first met in class..
- In the theatre.
Who would've imagined that we
would kiss while watching DDLJ
Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.
And then date for eight years.
Eight years and nine months.
Thanks for shitting on my nostalgia!
We were watching Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.
In fact, for the third time.
We had memorized the dialogues..
..but you were saying
them with all your heart.
While Shahrukh's
monologues kept going..
.. your horrific
impersonation got scarier.
I had a thumping headache!
But I kept saying them dialogues..
..so you wouldn't notice
that I was only watching you!
And your perfume
was driving me wild.
Maybe that caused the headache.
I think it was Lily.
To end your blabbering,
I suggested going home..
..and watching some
more Shahrukh films.
And something happened to you.
You just leaned over
and kissed me, and said..
'No one I know has
endured so much pain for me!'
Lavender!
The perfume was lavender.
Nice place, Gulati.
If you hadn't come here I'd
still be decaying in Delhi!
I would've never dared to step out.
So.. thank you.
I came here to look for you..
and found myself.
Say that dialogue again!
Seeing anyone?
- Yes.
Mr. Kunzru's daughter.
Mr. Agarwal's niece from New York.
Mrs. Srivastav's
''almost legal'' niece.
Preeti's gynecologist's
neighbor's step-daughter..
..who is also a gynecologist.
And both daughters of Mr. Wanchoo!
Don't ask, Al.
I'm going to India
tomorrow for Preeti's baby shower.
They're going to pounce on me
like a pack of hungry wolves!
Preeti's preggers?
- Don't start.
No. That's.. great!
What happened?
Don't resist it, Gulati.
Resist what?
Marriage.
Any girl would be
lucky to get your love.
And you?
Are you happy?
I am learning to be 'happy'.
You got what you wanted.
Yes, but..
Breaking things comes
easily to me, Gulati.
I nearly lost my mom as well.
All my life I
wanted to be like her..
..but turned out
exactly like my dad!
I even broke us!
Maybe.. I'm not meant for love.
'I don't want to deal
with your problems, Abhay.'
'This is it, I'm
breaking up with you.'
'Ayesha, even Abhay
has managed to move on.'
' When we broke up, I refused
to accept it as a possibility.'
'I didn't believe you.
That was my mistake.'
'Don't resist it, Gulati.'
'Resist what?
- Marriage.'
'Breaking things comes easily to me.
'I even broke us.'
'Maybe I'm not meant for love.'
I thought that I understood love.
But now..
I don't know anything.
I don't know what love is.
If you don't take
her off your wall..
..how will you get
her out of your heart?
The girl you eventually marry..
- I can't fall in love again!
These damn Bollywood remakes of
Devdas have ruined children's minds!
'Alas! She dumped me!'
'I dedicate my life to
scuba diving in cheap whiskey!'
Nothing sexy about that guy!
Aunty, I am not like you.
- That's the problem.
What if one was to leap from here?
They'd risk a few fractures,
brain hemorrhage and..
And that's the
difference between you and me,
I married thrice.
I broke my head,
suffered fractures..
..survived brain hemorrhage as well.
And I'm ready to leap again!
Why?
Because no matter how much it hurt..
..I never let myself be scared.
You have to be fearless, Abhay.
Or you'll end up sharing other's
happiness, in their weddings.
Love is inside you, dear.
Take your heart out of it's
shock-proof padding..
..and let it do it's job!
These tiny shocks can't hurt it!
And if you wanted to play so safe..
..why'd you fall in
love even the first time?
You kids..
..you can't want everything and
expect to not get a little hurt!
''It's drizzling in my thoughts..
Everything will be washed.''
''There will be a new ray of hope.''
''All the painful
memories will flow away.''
''There will be a new destination.
Let's go.''
Papa.
- Yes?
What?
Have you lost it?
Cy, keep it down.
You're on a film set!
What about me and our business?
We're discussing two more
restaurants with the investors.
I can't believe I'm
the responsible one here.
I get to behave like this, not you.
Abhay's getting married.
What?
Wow.
'Wow'? That's it?
I can't buy my Porsche 'cos of you.
Yeah, whatever.
Congratulations.. loser!
He told you first?
He didn't even call me.
And you're upset about that?
Yes, I told him to get married,
but.. he didn't tell me?
Why's he not answering?
Chicks are weird.
I hope the girl's a
voluptuous North Indian babe!
Not Abhay's type.
- Cy was talking about himself.
I can't believe he's getting
married. - And he didn't tell me!
Why? After all he's just marrying!
But, Ayesha, he didn't even tell me.
He will tell you. He must be busy.
Why?
What's the point in worrying now?
I'm not worried.
I'm happy for him.
But he could've called me.
But you broke up with him.
So?
- So he's moved on.
Not to another planet.
What the hell..!
Are you alright?
- Yes.
Are you sure?
- Are you deaf?
No, just rich and single.
Al..
I'm fine, okay!
No, you're in love with Abhay.
Ladies and gentleman, the
flight from Gold Coast to Delhi..
..will be now ready for boarding.
What will you do after going there?
I don't know.
You broke up with him.
- I know.
You think..
- I don't know.
Isn't it a little too late?
- No.
Maybe. I don't know.
Just shut up.
Chicks are weird.
Aaliya, please relax.
He's not answering his phone.
Obviously, he's
getting married today.
Did you try his residence number?
So loose?
Is this a blouse or a jacket?
I'm very high.
Mummy, butter chicken!
Why're there such few lights?
I've put three thousand already.
So double that! Where's Abhay?
There's no place left.
Put them up on my head.
Pick up, Pick up.. please pick up.
They must've booked the
honeymoon suite by now.
Goal!
Hi, Aaliya.
- Isn't that Abhay's ex?
Shh.. quiet!
Aaliya?
Uncle, where's Abhay?
He must be upstairs..
The vixen cometh!
- Where's Abhay?
Counting the last
moments of bliss in his room.
Aaliya..!
What are you doing?
Look at this!
What did I tell you?
But it isn't shiny, sir.
No, it's a damn tubelight.
- What?
Leave it.
But, ma'am, the wedding..
Drop it..
..or should I use
your scissors on you?
Abhay, listen..
God, I look like shit!
So do I.
Al..
- Shhh!
Abhay Gulati.
I love you.
Your grandma gave you this ring..
..for your wife.
For years it was meant for me.
And I ruined it with
much effort and diligence..
..with a little help from you.
But that's a minor technicality.
You were lost, I was immature..
But the point is that..
..the girl you're going to marry must
be a intelligent, mature person..
She has to be, 'cos
she's marrying you.
And I'm a crazy,
immature, stupid, fool..
..I have to be, for losing you.
But I've always loved
you and I always will..
..even if marry this girl,
who you don't even know.
But anyway the point is..
..even for a second, if you
still think you have a choice..
..then please..
..choose me.
Please.
Why?
'Cos you haven't watched Mr.
India twenty times with that girl.
She doesn't know how awfully you
bray when you sing in the loo.
How you know the name of every
kid on every traffic signal..
..even though they think you're '
And.. I don't have any other reason.
I've made up my mind, Al.
Is this marriage or vengeance?
We spent almost ten years together..
And were friends for
ten years before that!
Exactly.
Really?
Just because I turned
out to be a total moron..
..you'll marry any random girl?
She's not random.
Yes, she is. Who is this..
..Aaliya?
You're marrying me?
It's a typo!
No, look! It says 'Aaliya'..
Al..!
I don't need a reason to marry you.
I promised you no matter how..
..stupid, immature, mind-blowingly
moronically you behave..
..I won't let go.
How could the one who
pushed me to be brave..
..boldly took risks..
..was the 'star in her own life'..
..be afraid of herself today?
You taught me to be fearless, Al.
You can't give up!
You made us stronger.
And you're not like your dad..
.. or you wouldn't be here today.
You are meant for love!
By the way..
..the 'Thread
Maintenance Department' has quit!
I'm into spinning tops now.
The suckers stay on the ground!
Are you sure?
Al.
Eighteen years and nine months!
For the love of God, yes.
Then why are we getting married?
Excellent point.
We were married in a way!
When two people are together
for so long, it's a marriage!
This is pointless!
- Exactly.
'Cos here's a perfectly good thing
- Love.
Now let's destroy it,
piece by piece.
'Cos if we don't get
married Scandal! ! !
Just for a piece of paper that'll
tell us what we already know.
That we love each other.
- Exactly.
Or I wouldn't be spending our
honeymoon catering on your set!
See, true love.
This is not sin!
So please don't call
our kids weird names!
What? Hang on.
- But we won't have any kids.
Exactly..
- We will adopt puppies.
Then why didn't we?
I hate you, it's all your fault.
Al, breathe in, breathe out!
- I hate you.
I know. I love you.
I hate this guy.
Who the hell are you?
He's our doctor.
Don't touch me!
How else will he do the delivery?
I'm talking about you.
Please get this thing out of her.
Let's do it again.
I don't think I can
go through the trauma
What shit! I endured the trauma.
Come on.
No.
Sarah, mom is leaving you now, okay?
Like you left daddy.
What?
Sarah, mom loves dad so much..
..that she came back from
Australia to be with him.
After the break up.
It was just a little break.
So what does a 'little
break' mean Shah Rukh?
Oh shut up, Sunita!
And finally a whiff of fresh air..
.. as our bound arms
stretch themselves.
My heart wants to hum..
While he wants to sing..
I smile, he giggles..
.. powerless
against this crazy whim.
Distances are important too.
Sometimes you gotta chase space.
Distances are important too.
Distances are important too.
Sometimes you gotta chase space.
Distances are important too.
Such intimacy sows
seeds of distances..
.. don't be fooled,
these waters are not sweet.
Look, but don't touch; its fire..
..just watch it shimmer from afar..
..any closer and you could burn..
..powerless against this crazy whim.
Distances are important too.
Sometimes you gotta chase space.
Distances are important too.
Distances are important too.
Sometimes you gotta chase space.
Distances are important too.
I am rain and sunshine..
And he is a big bore.
Both rain but not together.
Life's easy with some distance.
We have our different worlds.
We are powerless
against this crazy whim.
Distances are important too.
Sometimes you gotta chase space.
Distances are important too.
Distances are important too.
Sometimes you gotta chase space.
Distances are important too.
