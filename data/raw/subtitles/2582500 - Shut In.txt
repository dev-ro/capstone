No, sweetheart,
I know you want to fix this.
It's what you do. But we've tried.

And I think the space

Today my son has become a man.
Because of that...
I know you think we're probably doing
this to punish you, but we're not.
All right?
Your mother and I want the best for you.
You have no idea what she wants.

I don't know why you're doing this.
I'm not the one that got expelled, pal.
Well, she doesn't want me gone. It's you.
That's not true, Stephen.
Yes, it is. You're sending me away.
It's not true, Stephen.
Your mother and I had
a long conversation...
- About what?
- We need a break, Stephen!
- I don't want a break!

It's not my decision.
They're moving him to Boston.
Some group home for deaf kids.
But we're making progress.

He's a great kid, we can...

I'm moving him to Covington.
Physically, I can manage.
Just about, but it's not him.
It's just a body that I feed,

I lost him that day
I lost Richard in the car.
Mary, being a psychologist
doesn't make you a perfect parent.
There's no such thing.
You did what you thought was right.

I sent him away.
I sent my son away and now he's gone.

I, uh... I was just...
I thought I'd make up
Stephen's bed in case...
In case Tom came back.
LUCY: Oh.
What time is it?
It's late.
Aaron Hart is waiting
for you in the office.
I mean, the kid's been
bouncing around foster homes
for, like, half his life,
but no one gave a shit then.
And now suddenly the whole town's
decided it's time to give a shit.
Do you know how many children run away
or go missing every year
in the United States alone?
I don't know.
Don't you see how fucked up that is?
Besides, the kid's dead.
Everyone knows it.
Okay, Aaron, that's about
all we have time for today.
Whatever, sure.
Thanks a lot.
Is your dad coming to get you?
Uh-huh.
(CHUCKLES) Teenagers, huh?
How's it going?
Does he hate me more or less than he
hates the rest of the world today?
(SIGHS)
No, he's just having a rough time
with the move and the divorce.
Sometimes it's hard to remember
he was just a cute little kid
who liked to throw a ball around
with his dad a few years ago.
He's so angry all the time.
He'll get through it.
It's just a difficult age.
You hear about this storm coming in?
Yeah.
If it turns into an ice storm, we could be
without power for at least a couple of days.
Mmm.
You probably shouldn't
be up here all alone.
Aaron and I are thinking of moving into
one of the hotels in town to ride it out.
Uh...
If we do, maybe I could
take you for dinner.
I'll be fine. We'll be fine.
My son, he's sick,
so I can't really move him.
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
I didn't even know you had a son.
How old is he?
He's 18. Stephen's 18.
He's my stepson.
I didn't know that...
My husband passed away, actually,
so it's just Stephen and me now.
Well, maybe the four of us
can get dinner one day.
You know, you, me and our angry teenagers.
Look, it's not really appropriate.
Aaron's my patient, so...
And he's waiting for you in the car.

Mary, calm down.
Look, listen to what you're saying.
I was there. It was real.
You're a rational adult.
There's no such things as ghosts,
and you know that.
Oh, God.
I think that you experienced
something known as parasomnia.
A sleep disorder that
can trigger night terrors.
I... But I saw him. I saw Tom.
Everybody's been saying he's dead,
and I kept wanting it not
to be true, but it must be.
I think that with the amount
of stress you're under
and the existence of disturbed sleep
already, it makes complete sense.
And frankly, you know, the fact that
you saw the runaway boy also tracks.
You know, you've been looking for him,
you're worried about him.
Does not mean he's dead,
let alone haunting you.
(SIGHS)
Do you think that the sound
of the child's footsteps
in your dream could be
a reminder of the child that
you might think you've actually lost?
You know, of the son that used to come into
your room at night when he was scared.
Do you think that that voiceless child
in your dream could be Stephen...
(CHUCKLES DRYLY)
...as much as it's Tom?
Long before the accident,
I remember you telling me that
you were feeling
like you were losing Stephen.
That you were losing your little boy.
Do you remember that?
Mmm-hmm.
I had been through so much.
(SNIFFLES)
Yeah. Well, tell me about that Stephen.
You know, Stephen before the accident.
Before the behavioral problems even.
I never told you this, but that morning,
he begged me not to send him away.
Go on.
Stephen always blamed Richard.
But I was the one who found the school.
I just didn't know how to be
his therapist and his mother.
Mary?
Mary?
Look, the nightmare about Tom
may be about Stephen, but that's
because everything's about Stephen.
I'd like to talk to you about prescribing
something to regulate your sleep, okay?
So I'm gonna need some blood work.
In the meantime, take care of yourself.
Thanks.

White sharks can weigh in

So, that's a very big fish.
We know that these sharks can live...
So, what are we doing
for this young man today, then?
Actually, it's for me.
I just need some blood work done.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing, I'm fine.
Then why haven't you
taken yourself to the doctor?
I don't like to leave him alone.
I try not to leave the house too much.
Handsome boy.
He's got your eyes.
He's not...
Thank you.
You take care of him on your own?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Hmm.
He looks good. Strong.
You must be doing something right.
Blood pressure is too high
for a woman your age.
Could we just, um...
None of my beeswax.
I get it.
You just wait.
The doctor will tell you the same thing
when he gets the results.
LUCY: So, when are you taking Stephen in?
MARY: (SIGHS) End of the month.
Dr. Wilson says I need to start
practicing leaving the nest.
I'm not really sure this counts.
(CHUCKLES)
I saw Doug Hart in town yesterday.
Oh, my God, I was so rude to him.
Funny.
He thought he'd offended you.
You should call him.
Ask him out.
Maybe I should call him just to apologize.
Yeah, to apologize.
(BOTH LAUGH)
DOUG:
I felt like such an ass the other day.
I had no idea.
Lucy explained everything to me.
Oh, of course she did.
That must have been hard,
taking care of him by yourself.
She told you about that, too?
And yes, Stephen...
I'm moving him to a care home.
Oh, I'm sorry, I had no idea.
She didn't tell me that.
I thought...
I'm sorry. I...
You know, I... This is hard. I haven't...
I haven't done this in a while. (CHUCKLES)
Were you guys close before the accident?
Very.
He was five when Richard
and I got married.
He was closer to me than his dad.
But then he hit puberty, and it was
like I had a stranger in the house.
Yeah, Aaron, too. I'm just like,
he's a completely different species.
Aaron is a good kid.
Well, his teachers disagree.
I had a meeting
with the principal last week.
Principal Hastings? He's the worst!
So, Stephen went there, too.
Until he was expelled.
No! What for?
Mmm, the whole thing was totally
blown out of proportion.
There were some kids, and they
were messing around in the pool.
And I guess they were
just teasing Stephen.
One day he retaliated,
but no one got hurt.
After his mom died,
he was dealing with a lot of grief.
And by the time he was a teenager,
he barely spoke to anyone
except me, and then it was, you know...
I feel like Aaron
talks to everyone but me.
He just completely shuts me out.
Hmm.
Well, I guess I should
let you two get to bed.

Acting on a call from a local resident,
Hawthorne police are now conducting

DR. WILSON: Mary?
It's Dr. Wilson, are you...
Are you okay?
Mary?
Anybody home?
Everybody okay?
I just thought we'd, uh,
have a little chat
before the police get here.
MARY: Oh, God.
I don't really think
that we have time for...
For games right now, do we?
Stephen, it's Dr. Wilson.
Stephen?
(DR. WILSON GROANS)
You told her to get rid of me.
But she loves me.
And no one is gonna keep us apart.

Oh, God.

Dr. Wilson...
I'm sorry.
It's okay. I'm gonna get you out of here.
He was here...
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
The whole time.
I'm so sorry.
In Stephen's mind...
Don't challenge his delusions.
You understand?
Don't let him see the boy.
It's you he wants, only you.
Enter his delusions...
It's okay, I get you.
No. Get the boy out.

(BOTH GRUNTING)
Stop! Stop! Please!
No, stop it!
No, listen to me.
- Stop. Listen to me.
- No! No!
Calm down, calm down.
You were right, okay?
I was focused on my patients, when
I should have been thinking about you.
- No! No, too late!
- Wait! Stop!
I didn't know.
I didn't understand
that you were doing it for us.
I didn't know.
So that we could be together.
No. You liar! You're helping him.
- (GRUNTS)
- (PANTING)
- No, I got rid of him.
- No.
I did! He's gone now.
It's just you and me, I promise!
- This is our house.
- No.
You were right.
He shouldn't be here.
(PANTING)
I was confused.
I thought I'd lost you.
But now you're here.
How could I ever replace you?
I love you, Stephen.

We both are.

It's good.
You want a dog?
Maybe.
(MARY HUMMING)
It's gonna be good.

Hush, little baby, don't say a word
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird
