Beloved Jesus
Please accept my sacrifice
for the dire sin of incontinence
So many people are obsessed with sex
Release them from their hell
And free them from their prurience
Thank you, Jesus!
Thank you!
Don't move now!
Inhale..
Exhale..
Now hold your breath..
Keep your shoulders loose
Don't move
Lean your shoulder against the board
head straight
Just a little further
No swallowing!
Don't move now
Just turn around a little
Dont move

Where to?
I'll just stay home
Then I wish you a pleasant holiday
Thank you! Goodbye

It will continue to accompany us along
We want to bestow this joy upon everyone
So the world can sing along
The world is beautiful
our lord loves it so
..blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now, and in the hour of our death. Amen.

Mary with your child so sweet
Mary with your child so sweet
Your blessing we thankful receive
Your blessing we thankful receive.
Alright, now everyone gets blessed by the mother of god
This is holy water
holy water, yes!
And now everyone becomes his blessings
He especially needs a blessing
Yes...
Alright
Now I have got something for you
Inside you'll find the prayer
She will be able to read it
so you can start learning it
That way you can start learning german.
This is for praying
Even the rosary is included, 
just like the one she's wearing
Right, you can do that?
It is very important!
Praying the Hail Mary...
Good morning!
The mother of god has come to visit you
Have you got time?
For the mother of god one must have time,
she came just to see you,
she wants to welcome you to our country
No, no , no, no! Not here!
Why not here? Madonna wants to come and visit you!
The mother of god-
Go away with that. It is bad, I don't want it here!
But, the mother of god is looking for a place to stay...
She just wants to help you!
She will help you to get a better life in Austria
Jesus
You endured the thorn crown for us
Every day you are getting ridiculed by other human beings
Please accept my daily sacrifice as a humble compensation
Praying the Hail Mary...
Jesus
It is so wonderful just to see you
You are-
You are such a handsome  man
You are to most handsome of all
Your eyes..
so loving, so gracious..
..so bright!
I get so-
My heart is getting-
so big, just when I can see you
I am so happy since we are in this relationship
I can't even imagine
how life was without you
I am so thankful
thankful that you have let me-
come to you
That you let me find you!
You are a miracle for me
the biggest wonder that exists
I love you, Jesus
The holy mother will certainly be able
to help you change your life
so you will have the power..
But we don't want to change our lifes
But you are living a sinful life! Don't you understand that?
What kind of sin are you talking about?
Who says we are sinful?
One cannot live happily together without being married
Who dictates what a sin is? God does!
God? How? And where is god?
He must have a lot to do then.
Yes, god has a lot to do...
God has given us free will! Exactly!
and therefore we ourselves are able to decide what is good and what is evil
No! God decides what is good or bad!
People are only able to choose to act good or bad.
That's not right!
As long as man respects the ten commandments
everything is allright.
I don't kill, I don't steal
I don't betray anyone-
Yes, and what about the sixt commandment?
That one's nonsense, it comes from a completely different age.
Back then there were just 2 million-
Aha! Now the commandments suddenly don't apply!
..people on this earth at that time.
And now there are nearly eight-
In the coming years there will be 8 milliards!
And what does that tell us? That we need birth control,
Or else after every-
One mustn't commit incontinence!
- intercourse! What incontinence?
That's just lust!
But you are constantly commiting adultery.
Adultery? No! That's not adultery!
Adultery is when I'm married and I have an affair with another woman
When one leaves his first partner and then chooses to live with somebody else,
that is like permanently commiting adultery.
Not at all!
That is your personal view, but not mine
These are gods laws,
hence the 10 commandments
Thou shalt not covet thy neighborÂ’s wife or husband
But we don't do that anyway!
But you are separated!
His children were conceived by annother woman!
So what? They aren't your children.
My wife passed away, what else should I have done?
How's that relevant? You are divorced.
That doesn't matter
Why didn't you stay with your husband?
Thank god that I left him
It's because he betrayed her!
God forgives each and every sinner!
Just if he repents!
No.This whole story about sins is laughable
Laughable?    Yes
You are insulting god!
No, I'm not insulting him. You do,
when you say that sins are laughable
that is very insulting!
Who is god? Who is god?
God has died for our sins.
Who says that?
because we have sinned and you say that's laughable.
God let himself beeing cruzified 
because we have sinned? 
Yes, just for you he endured the thorn crown and let himself get nailed to the cross
And why did he do that?
For your sins!
For your own personal sins!
Listen, god is the one who put us on this world!
He created us, he created us..
Cats are not meant to drive in cars
He was so excited and nervous
He screamed the whole time, it's time for him to get out of his box. Poor cat
You just have to explain me, what I have to do with him
I'll put the toilet down here
Now she surely wants out of the box. What, here?
Yes so she can run around
But you'll bring her upstairs later?
I'll put her in the garden
No, not in the garden, she will run off
Ah, then I'll look for another place,
I'm sure I'll find something
Yes! A warm place..
Look! This is your summer resort!
Goodbye, sweety. Yes, we'll handle that.
She just needs to relax
Bye bye, sweety! We'll just leave her here and everything will be allright!
Bye bye!
Come along. She'll have it nice here
..then you have to get the moist one, because it is not good if you give him just this one
and if he doesn't eat the one kind you can try to offer him the other
Yes. And if it doesn't work at all, it's not because he's not hungry
I'll put her down there
Yes, that's good
then you can try to feed him with your hand, he will eat then almost certainly
The dry food? No, that doesn't matter, it just has to be a different flavour
That he'll have to eat
And if he just doesn't calm down at all, you'll give him the bach flowers remedy
Then you can offer him two bowls of water, one with normal water
and another with a few drops of bach flowers extract in it.
He will then choose for himself
Hello
Hello Maria!
Anna-Maria
Hello
In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen.
Jesus, I live for you
Jesus, I'll die for you
Jesus, I'm yours
In life as well as in death
Oh god, have mercy on us
Be compassionate with us
Lead us, oh Jesus
Into your blissfulness
Heavenly Jesus
We are the prayer group "legio heart of Jesus"

Amen.
Heavenly Jesus, we swear our love to you
Amen.
We swear to you our obedience
Amen.
We swear to you faithfulness till death
Amen.
We swear to you, that Austria will become catholic again
Amen.
Praying the Hail Mary...
Holy mother, please help me to convert those people
Why didn't you phone me?
Why should I?
I wanted to surprise you
Did your family kick you out?
No
I just wanted to come to you
What would you like to drink?
I don't mind. Water is alright
But I could sleep in your bed just as well
It's not the time to discuss that now
But why? I just arrived!
Why don't we start over?
Anna! I'm talking to you, please.
I'll finish making your bed and that's it.
Yes, but I could sleep in your bed and it would be no problem
Haven't I got the right to sleep there too, or what?
What are you doing? Where do you want to lie?
Where should I put the pillar?
I told you I want to sleep down there!
Then I'll put it here
Just like that, huh?
Why don't we just start all over again?
Anna!
It's been two years and you won't let me sleep there?
Jesus, you know how hard it is for me, that he is here again
Although, if you want to test me, then..
..then I gladly accept that trial
and every other sacrifice that you want from me
I love you
Thy will be done, not mine..
Rolly!
Rolly! Where are you?
Rolly! Look I've brought food for you
Good!
Good cat!
Right, and now we'll put you..
Look! Isn't that a nice place?
You stay here a little while
so you can get some fresh air
Pssst! Don't be upset.
Stay calm!
Don't smoke so much
And if you must, then take the ashtray
with you in future. Ok, thank you!
Do not avoid getting up early
Your day should start with prayer.
Oh well
Only by mastering crisis..
you will become wiser
Oh yeah, fuck me as hard as you can!
I love you...
Please...
Please!
Maria bless the people
Bless me as I'm your child
So that I can find heaven
and the peace within
Bless all my thoughts
Bless my every action
So within your peace
day and night I can rest
So within your peace
day and night I'll rest
Mr. Rupnik?
Yes, what's the matter?
Are you Mr. Rupnik?
Yes
The wandering mother of god came to visit you
Who? What?
The wandering Mother Mary, look!
Where do you want me to put
her in all that mess?
Isn't there any free space left?
Sure, in the next room there is
Then let's move over there
Show me where you want to put the mother of god
Here my mother used to sleep
But when she died,
the whole bed died for me too
I just use it as a cloakroom these days
See, I can't lie down now
where my dead mother was laying
So you loved your mother very much?
Well, I think that I unconsciously developed some kind of dread,
that prevents me from lying down there
We have to bless your mothers death bed.
We should pray a paternostra for your deceased mother!
Hmmm, yes we could that that I suppose...
First we must put down the holy mother
usually I pray a lot..
Look here
We can put her up here..
No, she needs to be in the center of the room
This seems unworthy
Yes, but look, here I keep the candle that I light on her death day
Usually there's a candle in there, the last one must have burned out
So we should put her up here
Then you'll have to look up constantly
but your mother died down there
Perhaps we should put here over there
But that way is blocked
Yes, but that way you can kneel down and see the mother of god and the bed
Ok, then we'll just put her right in the middle
Maybe that is the best place
Do you still have any candles?
Candles would be nice
No, they are all burnt down
Let's put her in the middle
Let me get rid of the hat
Watch out!
We don't want her to fall over
No, no, she's stable..
And she would land softly anyway
Let's get rid of that now
we will use that some other time
Good, now let us kneel down here
What right now?
Of course we will say a prayer for your mother
It is very important to pray for our loved ones
Yes, I do that but just on holidays
then I even go to the cemetary..
Mr. Rupnik, let's kneel down now
Must I really?
Of course
But is there even enough space for the both of us?
I must first put away these books
Then let's get rid of them. Let me do it!
I can put them over there
I don't want to strain you too much
So you don't get exhausted..
In future you'll have to keep this place tidy
Yes, but, don't put away those nice suits
because when I'm all dressed up..
I attend to many of the greatest local events.
Yes, but now let's start praying
Please get down on your knees now
Really? I haven't knelt in a very long time
My knees will instantly hurt once I kneel down
You can do it!
It's unhealty!
It can't be unhealthy to pray in front of the mother of god
But I'm not used to that kind of thing.
You just have to put some effort in it
I'm new to all of this
Just turn your shoulder to the right a little
That hurts..
That's because you're kneeling wrong
What should I do then?
You must put your buttocks closer to the bed
No, I must hold onto the bed
or else I'll fall over
I do that as well
but the way you're kneeling it must hurt
Enough! That's enough, I'm finished
It hurts too much
This hurts. You know what?
I prefer to stand while bending down a little
This whole thing seems unnatural...
A little devotion now!
Now let's find some words-
How do you manage to endure all of that? The knees!
It's easy, and a little pain isn't bad
I can kneel for hours
There's only one way to explain that:
As we all know woman have some sort of fat coating around the kneecaps
this happened through femele hormones by nature
By the way I observed that woman
are able to walk around in the winter season
just with thin thights and short skirts on
and apparently they don't mind the cold
while men can't stand it
And that is because
woman have this nice fat coating
Especially the bottom
which I am generally very fond of
When its round form is bulging out,
its main purpose is to attract men
Please, Mr. Rupnik!
It's just a natural fat cushioning, that woman have
because of their female hormones
Mr. Rupnik, I don't think that this is an appropriate topic
to discuss in front of the holy mother!
Yes, of course, you're right
Allright.. Now do we really?
We will pray the paternostra for your deceased mother
Our father, who.. please join in
I usually pray in my own words...
No the paternostra has got to be prayed correctly
Well, then: In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
Our father...
I thought you know it?
Of course I do: Our father..
..who art in heaven 
Obviously
hallowed be thy name..
Right, right!
but that is just an embellishment, that's not so important
thy kingdom come..
..and thy will be done,
..on earth as it is in heaven.
Very good, go on!
Now that one is crucial!
Give us this day, our daily bread,
I often ask god to give my my daily bread
..Give us this day, our daily bread..
the next part is a little more complicated
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Now that one is very interesting!
This is the most difficult one in the whole prayer
Because he will only forgive us our sins,
if we forgive the sins of all the other people around!
So all those people who constantly get on our nerves,
we will have to forgive. Just imagine that!
Yes, but our beloved god also had to forgive you
and you obviously got on his nerves a lot!
But he forgives you, if only you do it to
Yes... But I never commited any serious crimes
After all I am a pretty normal citizen
Bless this mothers death chamber
and be her advocate in the beyond
Don't you think you should bless the holy mother herself a little?
The holy mother is blessed! One does not need to bless her, she blesses you!
She will stay with you for 2 weeks
ans than I'll come and pick her up again
What on gods earth are you doing?
I just wanted to feed her.
But not our food, are you crazy?
This cat has to eat too.
But not our food!
Look, the poor cat is hungry.
That is unhygienic, put her down!
Why? She eats just like humans do
The cat stays in the cellar!
That is disgusting!
The reason I came back to you
is because I hoped everything would be better
but you are treating me like I'm an immigrant in the streets
I feel hate against foreigners, even in our house
That is not right. It is not right!
I am reading your thoughts and your ideology
But this ideology is wrong!
Hate only conjures up more hate
I came here and tried to be nice, I tried to love you
and had so much hope for a new beginning
But I see you don't want to change
Forgive him!
He does not know what he is doing
Lord, I am your property
my life is yours
my salvation and glory to you
you gave it to me
paternally you are leading me
through all paths of life
according to my ambitions
Lord, I am your property
What is wrong with you?
I told you I wanted to see that programme
But it is not good for you
You always tell me this is wrong and that is wrong...
What am I supposed to do all day?
You could read a book,
or listen to Radio-Maria
You are treating me like a child now?
Like I don't know what I want?
When I want to watch TV
you say read a book
And if I am reading a book,
you'll propably tell me to watch TV then
I would never say that
You! Listen up!
When I want to do something
you are not supposed to go on my nerves all the time.
Do you understand that?
But I only interfere when you do things that are bad for you
That's none of your concern!
But I also have to listen to that filth,
those bad programs
I can hear it through the kitchen
Maria!
I'm warning you!
When I say I want to watch TV 
that means I want to watch TV!
Can you understand that?
And I want no sinful things happening in this house!
Did you get that?
Who told you that that is a sin?
And what are you doing outside the house all day?
What's going on with you?
I don't understand you anymore
I know exactly what kind of programs you are watching
You are only watching bad programs all the time!
Are you observing me the whole time now?
So you're spying on me?!
Do you want to take the TV
away from me now or what?
You always get so angry
when you're watching TV
It also makes you more aggressive.
Come on! That doesn't make any sense
I'm trying to be polite towards you
please don't force me to become unpolite
I told you before - don't bother me here
I want to watch TV!
Back off!
Leave me alone with your fanatic religious beliefs
Thank you
Please, be careful!
But I'm doing it gentle...
I can feel that you want to hurt me
Sometimes you behave like a little child
No, I am no little child
A lot of woman say that men are like little children
but that's not true
Turn around now
Darling
You know that I am a cripple.
Do you understand that?
It hurts me and I know it hurts you too
But you do remember how I used to be in bed
Yes, Nabil..
But that's the way it was
Right now I can't do anything about it
There is nothing going on down there
Look.. Nabil,
I am thankful to god that you had your accident
There's a meaning behind this
That way I started to believe again
You just got to understand that too
Yes, but it hurts me as well that I-
I understand that too
..that I can't satisfy you anymore
That had to be said
Nabil, you must try to understand what the meaning behind all of that is
Then you will feel better
Accidents happen for a reason
God is testing you
You must try to understand why this happend to you
Look at the life you lived before...
You drank..
you went out very often
It wasn't a good life! You just think so now because you lost your past life
Still I am happy that I can be here with you
I would just like if you would have
a little more time for me
I have nothing against you going out sometimes
It can get boring here with me the whole day
I understand that
I have to go to work, we need the money to live
I know
That is ok
I just wanted to tell you..
My conciousness tells me that it must hurt you
and I'm sorry, it hurts me too
Because-
What hurts you?
I just tried to tell you,
it's because of my affliction
But that doesn't have to hurt you
I am happy that things turned out the way they did
I just want you to feel it too
That you didn't grasp the meaning
af all this is what makes me sad
not the fact that you are paraplegic,
that is a gift of god!
"Radio-Maria" playing
You are having your breakfast alone?
No answer?
You treat me like a dog again?
Why don't we have breakfast together?
Why are you always so unsatisfied?
I'm doing everything for you!
Not everything!
I care for you, because you can't anymore
And I enjoy caring for you, but you are still never satisfied!
No, not always
Other people would be grateful, if they could live in such a nice house
Is that so? I help you all the time
I give you everything you need
You mean washing the clothes and stuff like that?
But you are never thankful
That is your duty!
You are my wife!
You must know that
In every religion you are supposed to do those chores
And I do them gladly. Yes, but there are also other things you have got to do
Things that are also your duty
But you don't seem like you want to understand.
It has to do with emotions
Emotions!
You are my wife and-
But one can never make it right to you
You could make it right but you would need to be able to have feelings
But since you seem to have no feelings 
I cannot help you!
Hey
You
You are betraying me!
Am I right?
Nabil you are in my way, why don't you drive back into the livingroom?
You are lying to me
Drive into the livingroom and let me do the dishes
You dirty slut!
Whore!
You are a whore, like all woman here
You are betraying me?
Am I right?
Stop it
Whore!
Slut! 
You are a whore like all the woman in Austria!
You will pay for this!
You filthy whore!
Pig!
Heavenly Jesus,
We swear our love to you
Amen
We swear to you our obedience
Amen
We swear to you faithfulness till death
Amen
We swear to you, that Austria will become catholic again
Amen
Heavenly Jesus
You are the vulnerable heart..
that is our rescue.

oh lord be gracious
be merciful to us
What is this, Anna-Maria?
Who are these people?
If you want people to visit
you must ask me for permission first
Did you?
the group begins to pray
Idiot! I'm talking to you!
Idiots!
Goddamn!
You whore!
Let me in!
I'll kick the door in!
That's a warning
Anna-Maria begins to sing
"Oh Haupt voll Blut und Wunden"
I count to 5 and then I'll tear the door down...
Have you gone crazy?
Let me in!
You know Jesus was cruzified and has been dead for over 2000 years
maybe you should try to find a better religion
You don't want to understand
Why did you lock the door?
You are crawling on the floor,
you whip yourself...
Is that religion?
Or are you sadistic?
No you are a masochistic!
Come out of here!
If you won't come out...
My name is none of your business
Maybe you are from the police, who knows.
I'm not with the police,
I come from the church
I don't want to sell anything
In fact I am going to give you a present
Do you want a beer? 
No, I don't and you shouldn't either
Look, I brought you a rosary
do you know what that is?
I couldn't care less..
This is a rosary!
And if you pray with that
you won't need any more beer
No beer, no vodka and no men
Now I give you a little of my beer
Where are you from, where were you raised?
"Where are you from" yourself
I am here
Yes, now you are here
Where's your mother or your father?
I don't like people wo ask me of my heritage
Why are you so interested in my heritage?
This is none of your business!
Where is your mother, the one who raised you?
It doesn't matter where my mother is!
Raising me up?
Didn't your mother care for you?
My mother fucked 100.000 men
But you also got a mother in heaven
Hmhm! Your mother!
And she loves you
Show me your tits, I want to see
No no no, we won't do that
We won't do that, No!
Come on!
I don't care about you anyway
just leave if you want to
I used to be a human beeing in the Soviet Union
and now I am just a huge piece of shit in Austria!
Then why did you come here?
Because of a foreigner, he worked as a cleaner
mother of god, help us
You've got a pretty skirt. Thanks
It's sexy
With that skirt you can seduce many men
No, it's not sexy. No
It isn't good to seduce men
Yes it is
Because men are seduceable
I had 30 men allready. When one commits the sin of unchastity one will become very unhappy
How long have you been in Austria?
Why does that concern you?
I just want to help you!
Help me? God in heavens!
There, now we spilled it
Your underpants are smelling nice!
No!
I want to check that out a little closer, come here!
Starting praying the Hail Mary...
Calm down
Look, there is nothing more left
Yeah, right
You don't need that
put it back there
Believe me you don't need that anymore
Aren't you smart?
You want to follow me around now?
Stop it, you drank so much today allready
Give me the beer!
Please give me the beer
Are you going to give me the beer?
That's enough!
Calm down, we got to be careful
It is the devil who wants the beer, not you
You don't even want it!
You don't need it
Please!
The mother of god will help you, so you don't need it anymore
You don't need it!
Don't be afraid of the devil
You don't need this anymore
Be strong
You have to be very brave now
You can do it!
Calm down
You can do it
Piss off!
mother of god, help us
Everything is allright,
you don't need that knife
You don't need that
Look at me, you don't need that
You're so beautiful! You are Maria Magdalena
I need you
Everything is fine..
Shit..
everything will be fine if I could just..
get another one
You greedy rat!
It's ok. You don't need that
It's only water
This is water?
I show you what is good for you!
Come here!
Anna-Maria starts praying
Come to me and I'll show you something good
I don't care
about what you are doing
Praying
Well, nevermind
You must think you are the greatest
Jesus,
she needs your help so badly
Forgive me!
I am so sorry
Forgive me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to thee!
It is you that I have to thank
for living on this earth
Don't let us down here

You've got to help me a little
Stop it?
You are my wife, is that not so?
Ok, enough!
Why?
Why do you punish me?
Why?
I HATE YOU!
