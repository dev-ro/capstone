The girl he had a crush on moved away.
Hajime Haruno regretted never having
told her, nor talked to her.
Not that it was going to make
any difference,
as he knew he never had the guts
to confess anyway.
And all this self-criticism made him...
... regret even more.
THE TASTE OF TEA
Sachiko!.
What?.
The tea's getting cold!
Or...it could be...
Like this.
Like this.
Yeah, the hands...
Like this...
And...
That could work.
The hand and...
I like it.
Remember that pose, okay?.
I'll go get the camcorder.
- Okay?.
- Just a sec.
Go.
It's a bit...
...different than before...
It was like this, and then you went...
You know, I'm thinking...
This pose?.
I think I'll go with this.
That?.
Isn't this better?.
Early July, I make my way into
a field of blooming sunflowers,
Facing the golden sunlight
as they set my heart on fire.
Are your eyes ablaze?.
Are your ears ablaze?.
Is your soul ablaze?.
It recalls the words of Buddha in the
primordial Sutta Nipata scriptures.
For a long time, nothing burnt me.
I spoke to no one,
answered to no one. Being a daughter,
a mother, a wife,
and a human being kept me busy,
made me forget.
The color of the burning sky, the smell
of the warm earth. Who is that calls?.
Why am I not running, now that
I've been released in the field?.
Right, then. Another poetry recital
from the vice-principal.
Now, Murakami, anything on behalf of
the student council?.
Yes.
Um, this is what we decided
at our last meeting.
1. Don't pick fights with Yamaguchi.
2. Don't throw stones at his house.
Sachiko Haruno was wondering.
When on earth was that giant version of
her going to disappear?.
And whenever she wondered, there was
a story she always remembered,
as she was doing now,
a story told by her uncle.
You know that pond you often go to?.
That area used to be a forest.
Folks here called it the haunted forest.
And so, well...
...dunno, maybe kids these days don't
believe in haunted forests, but...
I guess...
You guess...?. Anyway, er...
Oh, yeah.
So I was in 6th grade...
No, in 5th...about 5th grade.
In the haunted forest?.
Right, where I took a shit outdoors
for the very first time.
- Shit outdoors?.
-Yep.
For some reason, there were
lots of wild chickens out there,
maybe they flew the coop, dunno,
but kinda having no money,
I used to go there to find eggs, y'know?.
And on that day of my first outdoor shit,
I didn't go to the bathroom all day.
Even after school, I was wandering about,
looking for a good spot.
I ended up going to the forest, but
still couldn't decide where to do it.
It's surprising how much you struggle
in spite of wanting to go for it, y'know?.
Anyway, I soon came across this egg.
It was half buried in the ground,
like somebody had tried to hide it.
It was weird, but somehow gave me
the impetus. And I badly needed to go.
So, I did it, right then and there.
Because I'd kept it in for so long,
it was quite a dump.
I felt great afterwards,
till I noticed how dark it had gotten.
I suddenly felt scared and went home.
But on the way back, I started thinking...
What the hell was a huge egg
like that doing there?.
And why did someone try to bury it?.
And on top of that,
why did I have to shit on it?.
Normally I'd have brought it back home,
a big egg like that...
And thinking like that made me feel
really miserable.
But I let it pass for the day.
After that I kept going back
to look for it, but it just...
...disappeared.
It's not like I wasn't familiar
with the forest, y'know?.
But I couldn't find it.
So I finally gave up looking.
And that's when this guy showed up.
What guy?.
A guy covered with tattoos, bleeding.
You mean, like a ghost or something?.
Yeah, maybe.
God...
He'd be watching me at every turn.
It was freaky. He'd be there whenever
I let my guard down.
Like when?
Like when I'd be cleaning up at school...
Raking the school yard...
cleaning out the chicken coop...
You were cleaning 24/7!
Shut up! He also appeared when I was
studying, right here in this room!
And when I visited the shrine...
Anyway, he'd show up, no...
He'd just be there, watching me.
But why was he covered
in blood and tattoos?.
Beats me.
Wonder why. Anyway he was all bloody,
tattooed...
And had shit on his head.
Shit?.!
Yeah. Shit, blood and tattoos...
Wait, does that have anything to do
with you shitting in the haunted forest?.
Dunno...probably not.
Anyway, so this guy...
Hey, it's a pretty good story, right?.
Yeah, weird...but cool.
So he's watching me, till one day,
he suddenly disappears.
Disappears?.!
I was working on the horizontal bar.
Practicing all day, while he stared on.
I'd sorta gotten used to him by then.
So I thought what the heck
and kept practicing.
Then, when I finally got around the bar,
he disappeared.
Just like that...
Sachiko often wondered if the best way
to get rid of the big Sachiko was to do
a backflip on the horizontal bar.
However, something held her back,
kept her from practicing.
One of the key points being
that the man watching her uncle was
a total stranger covered in blood,
whereas the person watching her,
was herself.
Perhaps his case wasn't so useful
in solving her problem, she'd conclude,
every time she remembered his story.
Anyway, there actually was another
episode even Ayano didn't know about.
Something which happened right about
the time he managed his first backflip...
Boss!
Hey.
What the hell...
Skull fracture?.
No...See this and this?.
Guy's been shot.
It's a yakuza case?.
Yes.
Shit...
Is that like, for calligraphy?.
Are you kidding?. 'Course not!
-Hey, look at me.
- Yes.
How do I look?
Nice.
And this?. What do you think?.
Awful. Killed, buried and crapped on.
Didn't happen at the same time.
How do you know?.
You have to ask?.
He didn't die a skeleton, did he?.
And what of the miraculously fresh shit?.
Decomposition first, then came the shit.
Oh...
Better check the shit out as well then.
- Yes.
- You do it.
Here.
Around that time, Ayano did a successful
backflip in the schoolyard.
And the ghost of the dead yakuza who
had been stalking Ayano,
was finally set free from the stench
and from this earth.
In light of how it returned a lost and
angry soul of a yakuza to afterlife,
one could say, Ayano's shi... ahem,
droppings did have certain merits.
Wouldn't you agree?.
I like you. I like you a lot, Hajime.
PS: I'll be waiting at Romanchi
after school today.
Romanchi
I felt up Aizawa's breasts!
No way! Which hand?. Which hand?.
This hand?. You perv!
How did she react?
She was wearing a bra.
And they were firm. Firm!
Wait, wait, wait.
You're pissing off Matsuken.
Apologize, man. Apologize.
I'm sorry.
But, how did she react?.
Like, y'know?.
You lucky bastard!
Boing!
Aw, I'd kill for that!
But who'd you pick as a wife?.
I'd go for Kazumi Furune from Class B.
No way! Kazumi?. I like her, too.
Huh?. Really?. Get your own!
I've liked her since first year.
Me too.
She gave me a gift on Valentine's Day.
How about you?.
Me?. Linda...
In first year?.
You like 'em young?.
You watch your mouth!
I DO like 'em young!
Jailbaits?.
Uh-oh. Entering dangerous territory!
Young works for me.
I'm all for it if it's Matsuken.
Aw, what a loss, man!
Here he comes!!
Hurry up!
Make sure he doesn't see you!
Legs out! Head in!
You've gotta seduce him!
Hey Hajime!
Not even listening.
Ah, well...
It's all your fault.
Me?. It's yours!
You and your ugly legs!
Ugly and gross.
Excuse me, but I'm the one who had to
shave my legs till I was raw.
Well, man. I think it looks pretty sexy.
Not sexy, but like, nice and smooth!
What's nice about 'em, huh?.
Touch 'em.
Feels like sandpaper!
What, you like him?.
Yeah, he does!
Not like that. Not like that.
I just like smooth legs! End of story.
Anyway, we're way off topic.
We were talking about Hajime.
One month had passed since
the girl moved.
And he was on the brink of
female phobia.
There were two reasons for this,
Namely'The Soba Noodle Shop lncident'
and'The Convenience Store lncident'.
'The Soba Noodle Shop lncident'
Set B, please.
What's wrong?. Huh?.
What?.
Nothing.
We don't have to, y'know?.
You're saying that now?.
We don't need to go.
Whatever.
What do you mean whatever?.
Huh?
What?.
What?.
I'm not forcing you.
I'll go!
Why?.
What do you mean?.
I don't want you to feel pressured.
I'm saying I'll go!
It'll be over before it starts.
Hey...
Will you really love me more?.
I love you just the way you are.
So I don't need to go?.
Give it a rest, okay?.
Sorry...
You said you wanted it too.
I wanted to make you happy.
I did some research, read up on it.
They say it feels totally natural.
You mean when men squeeze them.
Don't talk like that!
No, I mean when women...'wear' them?.
All I care about is if you'll love me
more and more and more!
Don't make light of this.
But that's all that's been running
through my head!
Don't worry. It won't feel strange.
It won't?.! Of course it'll feel weird!
It's fine, apparently.
But...
You've said you wanted big breasts too.
Big tits.
Don't you want 'em?.
Yeah...
Let's go. It's time.
It'll be fine.
Should I call my mom?.
No, that's not necessary.
She might worry.
She'll be fine.
Maybe you could call her for me?.
No way! That'd be too weird...
Uh-uh. Too fucking weird...
Here you go.
'The Convenience Store lncident'
Hey, what's up?.
My girl needed pantyhose.
Oh...Hey, did she hit you again?.
Can you tell?.
You're black and blue.
No bone fractures.
That's what you say.
And your ribs?. They've healed?.
Still hurts when I breathe.
But no sweat, eh?. Tough guy.
I've gotten used to it.
Used to it?.!
Yeah.
Your girlfriend's scary.
Oh, she's not...
What the...
What is it?.
Look at me, this way.
Look over here!
It's nothing.
C'mon, lemme see...
Your nose is crooked.
It is not.
No, seriously. See, it's crooked.
It's not.
It's crooked!
It's not.
It's fuckin' busted!!
Yeah, she got me good.
And what about her?. I mean, does she
ever hurt her hands or what?.
Dunno...she wears leather gloves.
Scary!
Nah. I'd better get going
or she'll be pissed.
See ya.
Bye.
It's my birthday...
What to do?.
My birthday song...
What to do?.
My birthday...
Good morning.
Morning.
Good morning, boss.
Sit, boy.
You brought Aki?. I told you not to.
No real dogs.
Pets aren't allowed in this building.
Hey, are you listening to me?. No pets!
None whatsoever! So don't bring them!
Would you like some tea?.
Yes...
You're just like a triangle
Why, oh, why?.
Why, oh, why?.
Why are you a triangle?.
Why, oh, why?.
Why, oh, why?.
Why are you a triangle?.
Because I am a triangle?.
Why are you a triangle?.
Why are you a triangle?.
To a good game.
I'll go first.
Here's your tea.
I have mine.
Really?. Then I'll drink it.
That was some wind! Err, Miss...?.
Suzuishi.
Oh, yes. Suzuishi.
Well, why don't we start over again?.
Go ahead.
Uh... I'm Aoi Suzuishi.
Miss Suzuishi?.
Yeah?.
'Yes'. Nothing else you'd like to add,
like where you're from?.
Sorry. I'm Aoi Suzuishi.
I previously attended Yoyogi High.
'Aoi' as in'blue' in kanji?.
It's actually in katakana.
And your favorite color's blue.
Moron!
You?.
No, you!
Ah, you're beautiful.
Cut it out!
Um, where should I sit?.
Kakinuma, you can go home.
Phew! Really?.
Fetch a desk.
You could've just said so.
Wait till the desk comes.
In the meantime, let's start.
We're having a popquiz today.
Not fair!
Consider it last week's review.
You have 1 5 minutes...
And just like that,
Hajime was in love again.
So, it's a school holiday?.
Nope.
Uncle...
Yeah?.

'Go'?. Are you serious?.
Yep. I like Go.
Really?.
Never played?.

We're trying to clean up here?.
Can't you see we're talking?.
And we're sweeping.
So?.

Shopping. With Grandpa.
Man, I'm so tired.
I rode my bike all the way from school.
Oh...
I can't breathe!
The Go club!
Who the hell are you?.
Stay back baby.
Don't worry.
Get your hands off my girl!
Show me what you've got!
Piece of cake.

I'm gonna take the bike to the station.
Okay...
Hey, you're late.
Yeah.
School club?.
Nah, my bike...
What about it?.
I went home on my bike, but decided
I'd need it tomorrow morning.
So I brought it back.
I see.
Excuse me, sorry.
Let me through. Sorry.
So what do you think?.
Of what?.
Of this?.
Good vibe?.
What vibe?.
-Well, I was wondering...
- Oops...
Be careful.
- Sorry.
- C'mon, look at me.
I am looking. What is it?.
Don't I look weird?. Out of place?.
But we had to wear them
to carry them, right?.
I know that, but...
We could've taken a cab.
Which is what I said.
Don't pull!
But you'll hit it again.
I won't.
At least yours isn't as bulky, Rokutaro.
Don't call me that.
Huh?
I'm not Rokutaro when I'm wearing this.
You're upset?. If anyone, I'm the one
who should be upset, period.
Period, huh?.
Anyway, yeah, that is a dickwat outfit.
So I do look weird?.
Me and my costume?.
Yes.
- Looks funny?.
-lncredibly.
Incredibly?.
A disgrace to The Meteor Power Force.
'Meteor Power has reached ritical point!'
'That is possible! Totally possible!'
'What is your opinion?'
Should we do it here?.
Let's do it!
'And now! Deep within your eyes!'
'Turn on the Meteor power!'
' It's already on, sir!'
'Kids these days..'
'Call it evolution'
Your tears are the signal, the signal
The twinkling signal, yes, the signal
Bright sky filled with your soul's energy
Starlight Connection!
You want some, shithead?.
Huh?
Are you making fun of me?.
Sorry! Sorry!
Please don't damage it!
Yasuda!

Home run!
Been getting your hands on
boss's money, Yasuda?.
Get in there!
That really happened?.
All true.
Pretty scary stuff...
Right in front us too.
That's way too creepy!
Gave me goose bumps!
Don't exaggerate.
But it's scary, sis!
How?
Execution!
Execution?!
You're doing good.
Aggressive, aren't we, Hajime?.
Wanna play?. Think you're smart enough?.
Hurry up.
Just a moment...
Not bad. For an airhead.
Shut up, will you?.
We're serious.
Sorry.
Ok, I'm leaving.
Right.
Bye, then.
I'm leaving too.
Bye.
Mr. Todoroki?.
I'm off tomorrow.
Oh, really?.
Please don't call my house like
you did last time.
I told my husband that I'll be
working here all night with you.
Oh.
You know what I mean?.
Yeah.
Don't call me at home tomorrow,
like last time.
Are you listening?.
Are you listening to me?.
Yes.
Bye then.
Hello?.
Your wife's having an affair.
Who the hell is this?.
Moun-tain, oh my moun...
Oh, hey...
I thought you left...
Go out with me!
Wait! Wait...ow!
Stop it! Stop! Don't hurt me!
Don't hurt me!
Ow...
Stop it!
Ow...
Why'd you do that for?.!
Bitch!
Haruno...
Where's Little?.
He's um, still in Brazil.
Oh...
Still working on his art?.
Yeah, he's been back and forth.
Oh, really?.
Does he have a show? Like now?
Yeah, over there...Maybe, that is...
Right...
How have you been?.
Me?. Okay. I'm still a sound mixer.
Oh.
So...how's business?.
You have to ask?.
Oh, guess that's the way it is.
Right...
I'll open that for you.
Jammed.
Happens sometimes.
Your hands...
Nah, it's ok...
I'm just...y'know, really glad...
Huh?
I mean, you look well and... I'm glad...
I...and I'm glad about
your marriage too...
I'm over you, really...
But since l...never made it to your party
or to our class reunions...
Thought you might've felt awkward...
But I guess you didn't...
I did worry.
Really worried.
I called...so many times.
Really?.
Oh...right...
But I'm glad too.
Huh?
You look well, too.
Me?. Yeah, totally.
Good as can be, yeah.
Well, um...
Congratulations on your marriage.
I really mean it, honest.
This is embarrassing...
Congratulations!
Thanks.
Sorry, my hands were dirty.
Oops! What am I doing?.
Thanks...
I shouldn't keep you from work.
No, no, no.
So, good luck. Which may not be
the appropriate word here, but...
Want some tea?.
No, that's okay. I've gotta...
You have to go?.
Yeah...
Nebuta dance!
Sumo wrestler!
Give them a break, Grandpa.
It's the weekend.
I love squid!
I'm home!
She's back.
Told you.
I'm relieved.
Squid.
Where's my squid?.
No squid, Grandpa.
She wasn't with Ayano?.
Dad!
Hi.
I'm hungry.
Coming right up.
Where'd you go?.
Here.
Want natto beans?.
Can you pass it honey?.
Excuse me.
You're distracting me.
Why don't you ask him directly?.
Yeah?. You think?.
Look, I really couldn't say.
Ask Ayano directly, okay?.
I'll have him call you when he gets in.
Where did Sachiko go this morning?.
Dunno.
No. He'll do it if you ask properly.
Look, I'm busy now...
I'll get him to call you.
Want to talk to him?.
No.
So, he'll call you. Yes. Bye.
Grandpa!
What did he want?.
He wants Ayano to make his CD.
His CD?
He's a manga artist, not a musician.
