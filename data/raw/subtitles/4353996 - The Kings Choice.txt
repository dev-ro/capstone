JUNE 1905, -
THE PARLIAMENT DISSOLVES THE UNION
BETWEEN SWEDEN AND NORWAY.
THAT SAME YEAR, THE PEOPLE DECIDE
FOR THE CONTINUITY OF THE MONARCHY.
PRINCE CARL, OF DENMARK,
IS CHOSEN AS KING OF NORWAY.
THE POLITICAL POWER WILL RESIDE WITH
THE GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENT.
THE KING WILL JUST HAVE
A REPRESENTATIVE ROLE.
NOVEMBER 1905,
THE YOUNG PRINCE ARRIVES
AS KING HAAKON VII, OF NORWAY,
TOGETHER WITH HIS ENGLISH
WIFE, QUEEN MAUD.
IN HIS ARMS, HE CARRIES
THEIR ONLY SON,
CROWN PRINCE OLAV.
Got you!
Grandpa, let go!
Can you help me?
Could you find the girls?
- Here they are!
- You cheated!
- You got caught first. You're it.
- He was only helping an old man.
- I want to hide again.
- That's not the rule.
- Rules are stupid.
- Listen... I'm it again. Ok?
Ten!
- Ragnhild, come quickly!
- Nine!
- Father... are you here?
- Eight!
Seven!
- Has anything happen?
- I just wanted to see the kids.
- So you haven't heard?
The ship that was torpedoed
outside Lillesand this morning.
A dozen people rescued.
All are German soldiers.
They're here, dad.
They are here now.
And the Prime Minister
does not want to go against -
- his own Foreign Minister.
- Nygaardsvold is strong enough.
He won't negotiate with anyone.
There is no mobilization,
everything depends on Koth.
And what do you want me to do?
Say "The King commands"?
Show them how far we
are willing to go.
Five!
And how far is that?
How far are you willing to go?
Our opinions should
mean something.
Let's watch it all without
lifting a finger. Is it the plan?
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.
Nico is on the phone.
Are you freezing? Won't you
come in and get warm?
The children wanted to be out...
Four!
And you need to go see the
doctor about your back soon.
- What do you mean?
- Your back.
With all that's happening.
We can't be on the
wrong side in this war.
THE KING'S CHOICE
APRIL 8, 22:00
THE GERMAN EMBASSY, OSLO
- News from Norsk Telegrambyrå.
- Anneliese, the news!
She's asleep soon.
The news...
As announced by British
broadcasting this morning, -
- French and English warships -
- have laid three minefields
in Norwegian waters, -
- at Stad, Bud by Hustadvika
and in Vestfjorden.
Reuters have it confirmed
from London today, -
that the operation was
completed in one hour.
- What is he saying?
- That France and England
have mined the coast -
- to prevent shipping of ore.
Only that? I can not
imagine the Norwegians...
- 90 to 100 German warships
were spotted -
- in Storebælt and Kattegat,
heading north.
- Mostly armed trawlers
and defence ships,
- but also large warships.
- Reports from Stockholm
state around 50 warships.
APRIL 8, 23:30
FORTRESS OSCARSBORG - 28KM SOUTH OF OSLO
Colonel, foreign ships
are pushing through Færder.
Rauøy and Bolærne are reporting
they are fighting.
Turn off all lights at the fort.
Ask the Superintendent in Drøbak -
- to evacuate everybody from
Hallangspollen to Hvidsten.
- We only have crew enough
for cannon 1.
- Spread them across both cannons,
and call all non-combatants.
- We have not heard from Oslo.
- Nobody has made any decision.
- We don't have orders
to shoot, Colonel.
- I want everyone available and
ready to fight. Now.
- So here we are, in Oslo. No war.
- I have my post and get my orders
from Berlin, but we are here.
- I don't know what else I can...
- Heil Hitler!
Ambassador...
- The time has come.
- For what?
APRIL 9, 00:00
ROYAL PALACE, OSLO.
I'm waiting to speak with
my brother, King Christian.
Yes... but then you
need to find him!
Yes, I'll wait! I've
been waiting for 15 minutes.
Your Majesty,
Minister Koht phoned.
He asked me to inform you that foreign
warships have entered the Oslo fjord.
Your Majesty, we should
go to the basement.
No... I will not be a
prisoner in my own home.
Larsen! Binoculars for Eriksen.
The only thing you will do is
to give them this pen,
- so they can sign the agreement
of voluntary cooperation.
Keep it.
They will see this
as an aggression.
Then you need to convince
them that it is not.
They have sacrificed a lot
to maintain neutrality.
Norway is the main target,
because of the shoreline.
And not least because
of of iron ore.
The resources we can get by
occupying of Norway are immeasurable.
Prepare to load!
Come on, push it.
Load it in the barrel. Faster!
Colonel,
cannons 1 and 2 are both ready.
Good.
Filtvet is reporting a
ship with its lights off.
They think it was German.
They couldn't see that.
Not even on a clear night.
Getting the spotlight up
is urgent, Sødem!
Good.
APRIL 9, 04:20
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, OSLO.
Good evening, Minister Koht.
Mr. Bräuer.
On behalf of the German leader,
I bring this offer to the
Norwegian government.
What is this, Ambassador?
We have come to defend Norway
against a British invasion.
And expect in return
that there is no resistance.
I know that a Foreign Affairs
Minister and an Ambassador -
- can make that deal,
here and now.
I need to discuss this
with the government.
Then I will wait.
The government is here,
next door.
Commander Andersen wants
a categorical order -
- about whether to fire torpedoes
at the approaching ships.
Kopås is reporting silhouettes
of several large ships.
Colonel?
- Færder and Bolærne is
reporting fighting.
- The ships are approaching at low
speed, with no lights.
They are warships,
so damn right we will shoot!
All ready!
This war...
- between Germany and England.
It will become the most
meaningless war you can imagine.
It can only end in
mutual destruction.
Sødem! The distance!
- Sødem?
- The orograph says 1800 meters.
Too far! They are just
passing Småskjær.
- Let's wait for
confirmation from Kopås.
- No time. Set to 1,200 meters!
- 1,200 meters and decreasing!
- Warning shots?
- No warning. They are enemies.
- 1,200 meters!
- Cannon 2 is following the target!
- But Colonel... What
if we make a mistake?
- At my command!
- Fire!
- Cannon 1, fire!
- Fire!
- Cannon 2, fire!
Where are the torpedoes, Sødem?
Torpedo battery, quick!
Norway is an
independent nation.
It would cease to be if we
accepted the German demands.
Therefore, our answer is "no".
They know what this entails...
Your own leader have said:
"A people surrendering
to a foreign attack,"
"does not deserve to live."
We will not bow
down voluntarily.
Your Majesty, pardon. The Prime
Minister on the telephone.
Thank you.
The power is back, Thank God.
Speak louder, Nygaardsvold.
We have been invaded!
An attack was repelled, but -
- President of Parliament Hambro
thinks it's best to leave the city.
A special train will depart
from Østbanen at 07:00.
APRIL 9, 06:20. OSLO.
Are you ready?
The cars are waiting, dad.
We have to go.
- Is there more?
- Yes, yes!
Come on.
The Lord Chamberlain,
Wedel Jarlsberg -
- will join Your
Majesty on the train.
Are you not coming?
I'll stay until
Your Majesty leaves.
- Then I'll report for service.
- That's good.
- Where are the children?
- In the car. Everyone is here.
I forgot my glasses.
I put them in your
suitcase, Your Majesty.
I forgot my diary, too.
Also in the suitcase,
Your Majesty.
Father...
I have to go to the toilet.
Just because we leave now,
doesn't mean we won't be back.
- Good morning, Torp.
- Your Majesty.
Although not actually
a good morning.
Due to the situation, an
extra train is set up at Hamar.
- Grandpa!
- Hey, little buddy, you came!
Let's move.
It's the second carriage.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Peder. It's good to see you.
Likewise.
- Peder, how's it going?
- Your Highness, glad you came.
- Dad, why did not Ording come?
- He wants to join the service.
- Hi, Peder.
- Your Highness.
Looks like children are ok.
Yes, they think we're going
to the cabin.
The important thing is that
the family is together.
Did you hear anything, Peder?
I spoke to the Foreign Minister.
German ships have been reported
in all major ports.
Across the country.
Is there any diplomatic contact?
Is it possible to negotiate?
I think we should trust that -
this will be solved by Koht
and the Government, Olav.
I agree.
Your Majesty and family
must not lose your freedom.
But do we know that
this is an occupation?
The Government is holding
a special meeting -
- as soon as we get to Hamar.
Everyone is on the way, some by
car, others here on the train.
The President of Parliament
is controlling everything.
I suggest we trust him.
Hambro knows what he's doing.
He seems to be the only one with
the head on right at this moment.
Away from the windows! On the floor!
Everyone, please.
- What's happening?
- Quickly. Air planes.
- Together, on the floor.
- Children! Olav...
Where are they?
There...
The kids are ok.
Everyone off the train. Now.
- All right.
- Straight away, come on.
- Here, Your Majesty.
- The children?
I'll take that ...
- Run! Run!
- That way!
Everyone to the underground!
Your Majesty, come on.
Calm... everything is fine.
Diana, contact Minister Koht.
Say we need to talk
about further negotiations.
No one thought to tell
me about this plan?
There is nothing wrong with the plan.
It's from Führer himself!
- How did it go?
- Good. Why?
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Diana, what about Koth?
He wasn't there.
The Government has left.
- What? Where?
- They did not say.
Wait here.
Please don't touch this.
Excuse me. Don't go up.
Glad you got the piglet.
I can't hear.
What is he saying?
He says he wants to go home.
I want that also.
Tell him we'll be home soon.
We'll get home soon...
- Did he say anything?
- He said "Yes, sir!".
Does he speak another language?
Dooes he speak other
languages or only English?
He speaks Danish, Swedish, -
- English and Norwegian.
Danish, Swedish,
English and Norwegian?
And the language of the pigs.
Language of the pigs too?
I didn't think he would.
APRIL 9, 23:10. HAMAR STATION.
126KM NORTH OF OSLO.
Nygaardsvold!
Can I take a picture?
Your Majesty, welcome to Hamar.
Thank you. Prime Minister.
Hambro.
- Your Majesty, I heard that
the trip was troubled.
- You can say that yes.
- President. The trip
was well organized.
- Thank you, welcome.
- Any news?
The Germans control most
of the large cities.
Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim.
The ministry is evacuated.
Most are sent home,
others are coming here.
We're trying to take control.
I'll know more soon.
Did Oscarsborg sink a big war
ship on its way to Oslo?
Yes, they saved us, but the
fort is under air raid.
We have to accept
that Oslo is lost.
Where do we stand with the army?
We have sent orders
for mobilization.
- How?
- By letter.
- By letter?
- We were caught by surprise.
Surprise?
You think this is surprising?
I want to emphasize that our
belief in neutrality remains clear.
We are confident that new
negotiations will come.
What if they don't come?
- They will come.
I'm gathering the Parliament.
I know the German
Ambassador, Curt Bräuer.
He is a supporter of
Norwegian neutrality.
- And we want to trade?
- The Parliament will discuss this now.
We're staying in the city,
at the theatre.
I have other news that
might be heavy for you.
Your brother, King Christian, -
- surrendered Denmark
at 05:00 this morning.
If it helps, he did
not have much choice.
No, he probably didn't.
- "Surprised", did you hear that?
Our negotiation cards are terrible -
- because they did not mobilize,
like I've asked for for ages.
- Let the Government make
their proposal.
- But we have to be able to
negotiate on our own terms!
Let me speak with General Laake.
- Or Ruge.
Speed things up a little bit!
- Have you gone crazy?
- The Royal House trading
behind the Government's back?
- Someo of the army
still listens to us.
- We don't need a discord now.
There are people in Parliament
who wants to get rid of us.
So why are we here if they
don't want us -
- and disagree with
everything they do?
- Don't you understand anything?
- You do everything so complicated!
- Your Majesty. Sigrid Sælid.
Welcome to Sælid farm.
- Thank you for receiving
us on such short notice.
I need to get some rest. Can
I get a radio in the room?
We'll arrange that.
At ease!
We've taken Oslo.
All roads in and out.
With less than 50 men.
Good. It all went well?
It was a massacre, ambassador.
For our comrades on board
"Blücher", the pride of the Führer.
The Government
escaped, do you know?
We've come to protect the Norwegians,
and this is the way we are received.
They would fight anyone.
To them, we are invaders.
Let me negotiate. Contact the
Government before further lives are lost.
When General Falkenhorst
arrives tomorrow, -
- Norway must be in our hands, from
the King to the smallest farmer.
I have the parachute troops ready.
If today's negotiation fail, -
- I'll put them in to action.
Today? The Government
is in hiding...
Then find them.
Or else we will find.
Today, a state of emergency
was declared in Oslo.
A total evacuation will occur
in Oslo and Aker, -
- but no one should
travel to the areas -
- around the Oslo fjord.
Those who were notified ...
Luggage: Only carry-on -
- that will fits on top
or under the vehicle.
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.
Has the Government
made a decision?
No.
But I've made a personal
decision, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty. President.
A few moments ago -
I handed over to His
Majesty, King Haakon VII, -
- my resignation as Prime Minister, -
- and at the same time, the
renouncement of this Government.
I'll be brief, because
we have a lot to do.
As the King of Norway, I
can do nothing more -
- than to accept the resignation
of the Government.
But not now.
President of Parliament,
Hambro, has decided -
- not to accept the resignation,
a decision that I support.
This is not the time for negotiations
behind closed doors -
- or agreements between
small groups.
It's time to be open
with each other, -
- and I will be totally
open with you.
People chose you to lead them,
both in light, and
in times of darkness.
Therefore, the resignation of the
Government will not be accepted,
- not when people so strongly -
- need someone to lead them.
Your Majesty, honourable
house, we will continue.
The German envoy asked
to resume negotiations, -
- based on documents sent
to us this morning,
- to which we already said "no".
It seems like more people are
convinced that the situation has changed.
With the uncertainty that has spread,
misconceptions with the mobilization, -
- and German forces in Oslo,
Bergen, Stavanger and Narvik, -
- many think it's looking bleak.
- I don't share this opinion.
Despite this,
a majority still wants -
- us to resume
negotiations immediately.
- Negotiations about what?
- Your Highness?
- I'm sorry, President. But what
has changed since last night?
- I share the Parliament's opinion.
- I am a man of trading.
- But I must ask the
Government or Prime Minister:
- What do you think has
changed since last night?
- What do we have to offer?
- Minister Koht.
- Your Highness. President.
- Much have changed in
the last few hours.
- We've lost control of large
part of the country.
- We are under attack.
- But we still have our freedom.
- We have an independent Government
and the support of the people.
- The Government wants to
continue negotiations,
- in the hope of a cease fire.
- If we get a solution, -
- not unlike the one
Denmark said "yes" to,
- then this Government
will be in favour of it.
- It would save many lives.
- If the Government wants to negotiate,
I will be happy to support.
- The Prime Ministers resignation
was a gift from above.
- Hambro could have lead us!
- Instead we're sitting down with
a Government in dissolution.
- Instead of criticizing all the time,
try to listen and learn something.
- We have to stay together. We
have to support the Government.
- This isn't about
your personal desire.
- What do you actually need me for?
- You will be the next King of Norway.
I need to behave as such.
- We told them that
we needed to mobilize.
- That the war would reach us.
And look now!
- Don't be afraid to stand for something.
- Don't call me afraid -
- just because I don't embark
on all your capricious plans.
- We can't risk everything like this.
Don't you understand that?
- Olav!
APRIL 9, 18:40
MIDTSKOGEN - 27KM EAST OF HAMAR.
Guys, unload!
Line up!
Here it is!
- When you need something it's
always in the back.
- Where is Spiller going?
- I don't know.
And who is the Captain?
Can I ask where Spiller is going,
and who the Captain is?
To Hamar.
- That was Captain Walther.
Excellent soldier. Parachutist.
- What are you going to do in Hamar?
- What do you think?
- You know I'm expecting an
answer from Minister Koht.
- You have your orders,
and I have mine.
- I get my orders straight from Berlin.
- Oslo Police Superintendent,
Kristian Welhaven, is here.
- Good afternoon, Superintendent.
- Ambassador.
- The Norwegian
Government is reporting -
- that they intend to
continue the negotiations.
- But all hostilities
must cease immediately.
- One moment, Superintendent.
- Did you hear? Stop
the action against Hamar now.
- Can't do. They
received the order and left.
- Then hold them.
- I can't.
- Can't or won't?
Stop!
Stop! Stop the car!
- Superintendent! Wait!
Wait, Superintendent!
- I can't stop every single soldier,
but I want to negotiate.
- Please highlight this
to the Government.
- Will you do this?
- Please wait! Superintendent!
- I have a car.
I can meet anywhere, any time.
Do you understand?
APRIL 9, 19:30
SÆLID FARM, HAMAR.
We saw you!
You threw the snowball!
What did I do? Have I not
been sitting here the whole time?
No, you haven't!
No, he wasn't sitting
here all the time.
Vidkun Quisling, the new leader of
the Norwegian government...
Quiet, Harald.
Women and men of Norway!
Proclamation to the
Norwegian people:
After England broke
Norway's neutrality -
by mining the waters of the
Norwegian territory -
- without anything but
meaningless protests -
from the Government, -
- the German Government offered aid
to the Norwegian Government,
- accompanied by a solemn commitment -
- out of respect for our independence.
- Sorry. German forces
are on their way.
- The Government have abandoned Hamar.
- In response to this offer of solution
to this unsustainable situation,
- the Government implemented a
general mobilization -
- and gave the absurd orders to
the Norwegian army -
- to oppose the German aid by force.
- The Government have run away,
- after risking
the fate of the country.
- Under these circumstances, it is
the duty of the National Union Party -
- to assume power to protect the
interests of the people -
- and the safety and
the independence of Norway.
- We are the only ones, by virtue
of our national goals, -
- who can do this and save the
country of the despair -
- in which the party politicians
have left our people in.
- The Nygaardsvold Government
have stepped back.
- I will add that such that
the situation has developed -
- any resistance, will
not only be futile,
- but will amount to criminal
destruction of life and property.
- Every Government official
or municipalities,
- especially army officers,
- navy, coast guard and air force,
- is obliged to obey orders of the
new National Government.
Any defamation will result -
- in severe punishment to
those responsible.
On the other hand, every
good citizen -
- will be treated fairly
and with consideration.
- The National Government
has taken over,
- with Vidkun Quisling as
Prime and Foreign Minister.
- Superintendent Jonas Lie:
Minister of Justice.
- Dr. Gulbrand Lunde:
Minister for Social Affairs.
- Vidkun Quisling has just
performed a coup d'etat.
- Norway is at war.
- The King and the Government
are on the run.
- They will pass through here.
- Behind them the are German
paratroopers.
- The Germans have one one target,
to capture the King.
- Our task is to stop the Germans.
- We'll defend a line from
the farm to the forest.
- We'll have a road block here.
It will be a critical point.
- When the Germans
get there, we'll take them.
- I want a machine gun in the middle
of the path, east of the sty,
- and a local shooting team
at the forest line.
- Tonight we will be at war.
- Understood?
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Understood?
- Yes, Sergeant!
- Get to it. Groups of three,
build the first position up there.
- Next three, next position.
- Find boards and
spades back there.
- Seeberg!
- Yes, Sergeant.
- I need help to
control the road block.
- But Sergeant, I'm
ready to fight!
- Good. But I need
help to direct traffic there.
- But, Sergeant...
- Seeberg, this is an order.
Diana! Call Berlin.
Minister Ribbentrop.
He can at least get rid of Quisling.
- I know Quisling. An amateur
without any support from the people.
- Talk to him. He doesn't
live far from here.
- Who?
- Quisling.
- I can not!
He performed a coup d'etat!
- It would ruin all my
diplomatic efforts.
- You are a diplomat,
not a soldier.
- Don't try to do their work.
- Seeberg! Stop the
traffic for a moment!
Stop!
Good evening, soldier! I
think it's time to salute.
- Good evening, Sergeant.
- Your Highness.
- What's the plan?
- Good evening, soldier.
- Good evening ... King.
- I've felt like a hare all day.
It's good to see the farm.
- What's your name, soldier?
- Private Fredrik Seeberg, Your Majesty.
- Please know that I am grateful for
what you are doing. All of you.
Everything for the King, Your Majesty.
No, Seeberg.
Everything for Norway.
This is more my taste.
This is good.
Yes? Foreign Minister?
In a few hours the Government
surely will accept the terms.
- Excellent!
- Yes, but...
- This Quisling will never be accepted
as a leader of the Government.
- We like Mr. Quisling.
- We all do.
- But unfortunately he has no support,
- neither of the people,
nor of the King.
Hello? Foreign Minister?
- Hold the line, Bräuer.
- Yes, I'll wait.
- Foreign Minister?
Heil Hitler, mein Führer!
- This is Ambassador Curt Bräuer, Oslo.
- We are very satisfied with the
situation in the north.
- Operation Weserübung was a success.
- Mein Führer. Question regarding
this Quisling...
- Quisling is a good man. He's the
right man in the right place.
- All right, mein Führer.
- What about the Norwegian Government?
They want to negotiate.
- But it will be difficult if
we insist on Quisling...
- Why negotiate with a Government
that attacked us -
- when we came to save them
from the British imperialists?
- Can you explain this, Ambassador?
- No, mein Führer. Only
thought the Government...
- Forget the Government. You must
negotiate directly with the King.
- Insist on talking to him alone.
- Then he will understand the
seriousness of the situation.
- But inland they are
preparing for war...
- You have my confidence and
the authority to act on my behalf.
- Forget the Government.
Talk to the King.
- Good luck. We trust in you.
- Thank you, mein Führer.
- Heil Hitler!
- King Haakon will never
accept Quisling.
- If I arrive with Quisling,
everything is over.
- The King is in hiding!
- Quisling lives nearby.
Talk to him!
- What am I going to tell him?
- Should I beg on my knees?
- If you think it's that easy
we can change jobs!
- I'm a diplomat.
I work for peace!
- What diplomacy? What peace?
Stop calling yourself a diplomat!
- You work for Hitler.
You are just a soldier.
- Anyone can be a diplomat -
- with a gun pointed at
the other guys head!
Anne...
- Everything in order?
- What did Berlin say?
APRIL 9, 21:25
GAARDER FARM
ELVERUM, 30KM EAST OF HAMAR.
- I will register for service.
- I'll be more useful in
the field than here.
- How can I exhort people
to fight if I don't?
If I don't have the courage myself?
- That soldier that stopped us in Midtskogen.
What was the name?
- Seeberg.
- Yes, he spoke to father.
- A young boy with a
huge helmet and a huge weapon.
- Much too young!
How can I look him in the eyes,
take his hand, salute him, -
- if I'm not prepared to offer
the same as him?
- For our country!
- Märtha, I need to be able to look myself
in the eyes and say I tried everything.
- It's just a bit sudden.
- We talked about it last winter.
- Yes, we... I know.
- But a lot has happened
since last winter.
- What about us?
- You will stay together.
- What about you? What
do you think of this?
- Your Majesty,
can I ask for a word...
- Our main goal should be
to keep the children safe.
They, the Crown Prince and
Prince Harald under one roof -
is not safe.
- We can't separate them now!
- Your Majesty, we have to take
the children across the border.
- I can not leave Norway.
- We can not leave Norway!
Not now.
- We will not do this.
- Peder is right.
- Harald is important.
- And you will be less vulnerable.
Both of you.
- We need to separate.
You two stay together.
- I'll take the children to Sweden.
- Dad?
- Look who's coming there.
- Listen...
- Should we go out and see if there
are any animals on the farm?
- Has piglet ever tried
to ride horses?
- Have you seen these before?
Not as big as "real" horses.
- You'll sit comfortably here
whilst riding, right?
- What is it?
- Grandpa, when are we going home?
- I don't know.
- Dad!
- Märtha and the kids need to go.
The Germans are coming.
- We have to go. Come on,
Harald, let's get to the car.
- What happened?
- Quickly. They are many.
- Where are we going?
- You're going to travel with Mom.
- The German forces have passed Hamar.
- They are many more than we thought.
- They will be arriving at the
blockade soon, 3 km from here.
- We leave as soon as the princess
and the children are the car.
- Your Majesty, they are
closer than we thought.
- My kitty!
- Grandpa...
- Get in the car.
- Protect Harald, understood?
- What did he say?
- He said "Yes, sir!".
- I love you.
- Be careful...
- See you soon...
- Go... no, stop!
- Now go!
- Your Majesty!
- I swore this would never happen.
- I would never leave
them like this.
- You never did.
- No...
- No, I know that.
- Contrary to others...
- Leave your mother alone.
- She did her best.
- You have to stop.
- I beg your pardon?
- You have to stop saying that.
- That she did the best she could.
- That she was there for you, that she tried.
She didn't.
- Fled on horseback to England
as fast as she could.
- She was alway missing!
- And don't say she was
there for me, because...
- You were the one!
You were there.
- You and the nannys.
- And now I'm here, -
- while Märtha and the
children are going to Sweden.
- On that day, in 1905,
when we came here...
- We arrived by ship.
- We suddenly become King and Queen.
And Crown Prince.
- There were people everywhere.
They waved, greeted us and were happy.
- You were not much older
than Harald is now.
- You wore a white dress
that your mother had picked.
- Looked like a little girl.
- And I carried you all the time.
- Because you were afraid.
And angry.
- You said all the time:
"Dad, I want to go home."
- And I...
- I had decided.
I had a choice.
- You had no choice.
- I chose for you.
- And I'm still sorry for that.
- If you want something different now.
- No, I...
- Dad, I never said I wanted
something different.
- I just don't want to be
the King that you are.
- They want us to stop in Nybergsund.
- We can spend the night there.
- It's close to the Swedish border.
- Is anyone here?
- Good evening.
- Do you speak German?
- Yes.
- I'm Ambassador Curt Bräuer.
Who are you?
- Waldemar Johansen, office manager.
- Good. You can help me.
- I have an important
message for King Haakon.
- I can't contact the King.
Talk to someone in the palace.
- I'm the top German
diplomatic representative.
- Get in touch with the
King and the Government.
- It's a matter of life or death!
- Is it not a little late?
You are shooting us.
- I'm alone here.
- You dare to talk about negotiations,
after making it impossible!
- Believe me, I just want to
help your country.
- I will do anything to prevent
war and negotiate a solution.
- I have the permission from the
Führer to to suspend hostilities,
- but I need to find King Haakon.
- So, please help me do this!
APRIL 10, 00:30. MIDTSKOGEN.
- I heard you speak German...
- Yes.
- That's good. It might be nice
to have you around, if...
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
- Don't light that up in here.
- Good evening.
- See you later.
- They accepted.
- Really?
- I'll meet the King at noon.
On one condition.
- That the advances stop immediately.
I promised them that.
- This will not happen.
- I'm sorry?
- Walther and Spiller have passed Hamar.
Soon they will be at Elverum.
- Did you not hear me? I have an
audience with the King of Norway.
We have reached our diplomatic
goal, Lieutenant Colonel.
I have my orders, Ambassador.
The Führer personally ordered
to arrange this meeting.
Are you going to stop me?
Do your work. If you
succeed, my congratulations.
But don't tell me how to do my job!
Good...
Anneliese?
Anneliese, it's me!
Anneliese, open!
Look at the little one!
In position! To your stations!
Vestli, do you see anything?
No. Nothing.
Follow me.
Please be quiet.
Come on, let's get them...
- What are we waiting for?
- We have to wait for the order.
No conversation.
What are they doing?
- Can I shoot?
- Wait for the order!
Fire! Fire!
My God, they are
many more than us!
- Seeberg! This way!
- Seeberg, your position is there!
Damn! Jammed!
Pass!
Germans!
Take cover!
Come back, Seeberg!
Seeberg! Come back! Seeberg...
APRIL 10, 02:50
NYBERGSUND, TRYSIL
60KM EAST OF ELVERUM
Your Majesty. Your Highness.
I don't know if you
know already, but...
- The Germans have passed Hamar.
- We saw the blockade in Midtskogen.
- The battle may already have begun.
- Okay... thank you.
- Welcome, Your Majesty.
Around here.
- Wake up, Seeberg!
- We need help here!
- Pull back!
- Wait, wait...
- What about Seeberg!
- We can't leave him alone!
- Vestli, let's go back!
- I'm staying here with Seeberg!
- Vestli, fall back!
- I'll stay here with Seeberg!
- You are a civilian!
Can you stay?
- Say "Ich bin Zivilist!" Say it!
- Say this when they get here!
Vestli, let's go back.
- No!
- Vestli, fall back!
- Wait... his name is Fredrik.
- Don't leave him behind!
- Hands Up!
- Make space. Move it!
- Do you speak German?
- Answer me.
- Where were you going?
- Do you have armoured vehicles?
Machine guns?
- Where is the King?
- And the Government?
- We have little ammunition
and many casualties.
- We won't find anything here.
We need reinforcements.
- Battalions...
- Two hundred... and more...
- What did you say?
- Machine guns.
- Battalions?
- Let's go.
- To the cars! Draw back!
- Battalions?
- But surely there are
no more of you up here?
APRIL 10, 08:10
NYBERGSUND, TRYSIL
No, we can't accept this!
- Only a few hours ago they
tried to get us -
- and His Majesty the King.
- And now you want to send my
father back to meet the German!
- Alone!
- I don't understand how you
still need to discuss this!
- And with Quisling in Oslo...
- Maybe they want to discuss
about a new Government,
- and Quisling's resignation.
- Forgive me, Prime Minister,
but these are just empty words.
- I would never ask this of the
King if it wasn't necessary.
- But the Government and I believe
that negotiation is the only option.
- I would like to agree with you, -
- but we have done everything we
can to negotiate.
- And what was the answer?
Violence! They attacked us!
- No...
- Send me.
- They requested the King in person.
Alone.
- They broke their own ceasefire, -
- and you want to send my father
straight into the lions' lair!
- This is madness!
We must stand for something!
We have to put an end
to this nightmare!
- It might calm the situation
if we say that -
- the King will meet the Germans.
- If we do nothing, I fear
an even worse bloodbath.
- Your Majesty...
- Dad, there must be another option.
Surely.
- I think we'll avoid more
bloodshed if we negotiate.
- Can I talk to my
father alone, please?
- Yes, of course.
- Gentlemen, let's get out.
- All right?
- Dad?
- Everything in order?
- If I can avoid more casualties
by meeting the German, -
- then I have to do it.
- But father...
- Then I have to go there.
- We can ask him to come here.
- We agree a neutral location
and have him brought to us.
- They can't ask you to go
to Elverum. It's not safe.
- Even if Koht promised,
you don't have to go.
- I strongly advise you not to go.
It could be a trap.
- You said you wanted to
fulfil your duty.
- This is my duty.
- If this is how it
should be, if...
- If I'm the last
card, then so be it.
- I have to try at least.
- There must be other solutions.
- Yes, always. There are
always other solutions.
- But are they the right ones?
- You should not be like me.
- You must be yourself.
- And with time you'll become
the King you want to be.
- Dad, if you go, at least
I should come with you.
- You know you can not.
- Be ready, just in case
something happens.
- Yes...
- What do you hope to
accomplish with this?
- Do you really think the King will
accept Quisling after yesterday?
- I don't take responsibility for yesterday.
- Somebody else will have
to answer for that.
- Think about your family.
Have they not suffered enough?
- Let me fetch the King.
- Just tell me where he is hidden.
- Keep your men away.
- Let's play by my rules
for a few hours.
- What do we have to lose?
- We don't negotiate. We take.
- You are not the only
one going to Elverum.
- Keep an eye on the sky.
- You never know when it will
fall on top of your head.
- I'm leaving now. All going well,
I'll be back tonight.
What are you doing?
I'm going.
And I'm taking Clara with me.
Where to?
Home.
I have no words to say how
sorry I am, Anneliese.
Please forgive me.
Could you forgive me again?
- Ambassador
- I'm coming.
- The car...
- I'm coming, I said!
- I'm so sorry for what happened.
- Please forgive me.
- Forgive me.
- Who do we have here?
- See you soon, my dear.
- Your Majesty, we don't have to
leave for another half an hour.
- I can't stay here any longer.
- Can I ask you to enter
the car, for safety?
- Let's just drive.
- As you wish.
- Øyvind, we're ready!
- Dad! You don't have
to leave yet?
- If something happens...
- there are a number of practical
things you need to know.
- Peder knows everything.
- I know all that.
- Never be alone.
Always keep Märtha by your side.
- If something happens, you need
someone to trust, to love.
- Protect the children.
- Everything for Norway... right?

ELVERUM PUBLIC SCHOOL
- Your Majesty.
- Mr. Koht.
- Mowinckel. Sundby...
- So, this is where it will happen.
- What?
- This is where it will happen.
- One can say that...
- We can arrange a room for you -
- and let you know when the
Ambassador arrives.
- Very well.
See.
- Out. Get out of the car.
- What is he saying?
- Get him out
- Ask him what he wants.
- Only him!
- Come back inside.
- I'll fix this.
- Only you.
- Sorry, the time is running out.
If you please...
- Shut up!
- Sorry, is this really ...
- I'm sorry...
- Do you understand German?
- No!
- I'm the German Ambassador...
- Yes?
- More coffee?
- No, I think it's enough.
- Your Majesty,
something is wrong.
- He's just delayed.
- Are you sure?
- As sure as you were that the
Germans would not invade us?
- I think we have to break up.
- Take it easy.
- Your Majesty, let's leave now.
- I can't open it.
- Look...
- Your Majesty.
- I need some air.
- Here. This will open.
- There he is. Are You ready?
- Yes, let's go.
- I'll go down and receive him.
- Minister Koht.
- Dr. Bräuer.
- Pleasure.
- Welcome.
- Your Majesty, it's an honor.
- My Lord.
- Thank you.
- Mr. Lykke and Mowinckel.
- Good morning.
- I've heard that His Majesty
understands German.
- If allowed, I would appreciate
if we could continue in German.
- Unfortunately, my Norwegian
is not great.
- Well... after confering
with the German Führer, -
- I have the authority to
negotiate directly with Your Majesty.
- With all due respect, -
- the conversation was scheduled
between me and His Majesty.
- Is that correct?
- He misunderstood.
- This will be resolved.
- This issue will be discussed
only with the Government present.
- I wish that these gentlemen
are present as witnesses.
- Unfortunately, I must insist.
My orders are from the Führer.
Just Your Majesty and my humble person.
- It's important that the
Government is represented.
- He wants us to leave...
- Then we quit.
- Your Majesty.
- Mr. Bräuer! We will
do as you wish.
- Yes. Gentlemen, let's get out.
- I've had the pleasure to meet Your
Majesty on an earlier occasion.
- Can Your Majesty remember?
- For me, at least,
it was a great day.
- You should know that the Führer
holds great esteem for Your Majesty.
- And Your brother.
- I nurture great respect
for the kingdom of Norway -
- and for the monarchy,
as an institution.
- But, currently, we have
control of the country.
- The official Government has no power.
Quisling has.
- And it's the Führer's
wish that it remains so.
- The agreement the Führer wishes
to sign with Your Majesty -
- remains the same, but with
Quisling as Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty, may
I speak frankly?
- I fully understand
that a solution -
- so comprehensive can
not be so filed.
- I have great respect for Your
Majesty, but not for Quisling.
- Instead, I share of
Your disdain for him.
- He is a miserable creature that has
interfered with the negotiations.
- But he has a reputation in Berlin.
Even Hitler knows who he is.
- That's why I asked for this
meeting, eye to eye.
- I am ready to submit an
alternative proposal.
- The agreement remains the same,
but without Quisling.
- I give you my word, Your Majesty.
- If Your Majesty signs
here and now, -
- Quisling will be gone.
- I'm running a big risk.
- Hitler wants Quisling, but You rather.
- I'm so convinced of this
that I'm risking my career.
- Does Your Majesty understand
what I'm saying?
- I mean, my German?
- Do they expect a yes or no?
Here and now?
- Well...
- The offer will not be repeated.
You can save Norway.
- Become a hero of the country!
The King of the People!
- Did you know that in the
whole history of Norway, -
- I was the first King to be
elected by the people?
- Norway is a democracy.
- The people choose. The people
are heard and respected.
- I would neglect all this if
I gave you an answer now.
- The destination of our country
is not decided in a room,
- eye in the eye.
- The decision must be
made by the whole people.
- I have a lot of respect for
Your Majesty's attitude.
- But if you say "no," people will die.
It's that simple.
- Young Norwegians will lose
their life in a meaningless war.
- Do You want this on Your conscience?
- To have the blood of Norwegian
men and women on Your hands?
- Your Majesty...
- I have a 5 month old
daughter, born in Norway.
- The last thing I want is for
her to grow up amid the war.
- Please sign, here and now.
- Save Norway.
- Do like your brother. In Denmark
barely a shot was fired.
- You dare to teach me
about my own brother!
- About my own family!
- Who do you think you are?
- A messenger, Your Majesty, -
- who wants the best for Norway and
who believes in a peaceful solution.
- A nice little peace dove,
that's what you are!
- A negotiator amongst
all the war merchants.
- But a peace dove wouldn't
demand to surrender our country.
- This offer...
- You're not any better than Hitler!
- Majesty, this agreement
is valid just here and now.
- Let's bring in the
Foreign Minister again.
- Towards the Government we will not
be so lenient, if you understand me...
- I don't know what you talked
about while we were outside, -
- but the Government of Norway
is ready to negotiate, -
- as soon as we know
the conditions.
- It will not happen without
the signature of the...
- Koht, what is this?
- I'm saying we can negotiate.
- Please sit down.
- Dr. Bräuer, could we
continue in English?
- Firstly: You can negotiate with us.
- I can't negotiate. I have clear
orders from the Führer.
- I've exceeded them already.
The law will be invalidated.
Please, Mr. Bräuer, we have authority.
- We are the Government.
- I have to say good afternoon.
- Dr. Bräuer, we need
to continue to talk.
- No. I'm sorry.
- Dr. Bräuer, please...
- I expect the Government's
response by this evening.
- Mr. Koht, I'm sorry.
- It has left a great
impression on me -
- that the responsibility for what
will happen to the people and the country -
- if the German demands are rejected,
is put on me.
- It's a heavy responsibility.
- So heavy that I dread to bear it.
- It's the Government that
has the decision, -
- but my position is clear:
- I can not accept the German demands.
- It would be contrary to everything
I think is my duty as a King -
- since I arrived to this country,
almost 35 years ago.
- I can not cross that line.
I don't want to cross that line.
- I don't want this to be the
deciding factor for the Government.
- But I have carefully
tested myself...
- and weighted my position.
- And I can not name Quisling,
- that I know not to have any
support from the people.
- Should the Government
decide to accept -
- the German demands, -
- and I totally understand -
- the reasons to do so,
- in view of the imminent
danger in which we are in, -
- and because of the large
number of young Norwegians -
- that will have to sacrifice
their lives in the fight.
- Should you choose to
accept these demands, -
- then there is no
other way for me...
- but to abdicate.
- For me and for my house.
- I understand. Thank you.
