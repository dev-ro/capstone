And that?
Fell.
Pass me my downer.
Cops pick you up?
Yeah.
-Been in the shelter?
-Yeah.
Asshole...
Here, go sleep.
Some guy's bedded down over
there.
Can't figure how he got in.
Tomorrow, out on his ass!
You! Come on...
Move it!
Pick up your shit!
And beat it!
Don't ever come back here! NEVER!
Miss!
Shit!
That me there?
That me?
Yes...
from memory.
Where'd you see me?
Took you for dead.
You give it to me?
No...
Really want it? Yes?...
Pose for me, right now.
And you got it.
A portrait.
Don't look at me...
over there...
Julian... Julian...
That's not me.
My Michele.
I'm so worried.
Howare you living? Where?
Your portraits ofJulian remain
here.
I look at them each night
and think ofyou.
Don't leave me without news.
I love you, Marion.
Night already...
Passed out, huh?
Was I drawing?
Yeah.
Louisiana...
You bring me here?
Yeah.
What about the old guy who...?
It's OK.
Want to eat?
Raw fish...
Iike in Japan.
Is it fresh?
They call it "sushi"...
"Wake up, little sushi, wake up!"
Have a name?
Alex.
One day, I'll draw you.
Got to sleep more.
Sure it's OK here?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Tomorrow, out on her ass!
Fish again!
Where's Saint-Cloud?
Saint-Cloud?
Waywest... in the rich suburbs...
Why you asking?
Nothing.
The girl... she's gotta stay here.
-Gotta stay.
-Hell, no!
Couple of days... she's sick.
Don't want her in my face!
Why?
DON'T WANT HER IN MY FACE!
GET IT?
Here, go sleep.
No!
Give me your hand.
The girl...
just a couple of days.
No drink! Not a drop!
Fix it so she's out of my face.
Fix it, right?
Just a couple of days.
Just a couple.
Michele?
Who's there?
What's it mean :
"First Love"?
Julian...
only one she loved...
"Love forever"...
Don't get it...
"First Love"...
Drew him, over and over,
only him...
He played music for her,
only her.
Then something happened.
Don't get it...
Fights...
sad...
Then...
he drops her.
She's waiting for him... so much...
That's why her eyes're so bad?
Can't forget him...
That why she loves him?
That why she's in the street?
Maybe looking for him?
Done a good job!
Gotta go to work.
Shit!...
Here
bought it for you.
Uh?... Thanks.
Don't have to go 'way
to get the news.
Gotta go work.
...city moves into high gear
for the 1789 Bicentennial...
My spot! See you again,
I bust your cords!
Beat it!
Hi...
See the guy playing the cello?
Wasn't a guy... a lady...
took the train...
It can't be.
A fat lady...
Who's there?
Michele.
You? How'd you find me?
Open up, Julian.
I don't see you.
Open up.
No, we have to forget each other
now.
I'm not asking for love.
No!
There's something
you don't know... about me.
Don't be cruel.
Move your finger...
I need to see you... one last time...
need to paint you.
No!
You can't refuse!
No!
Love...
Love...
If you refuse, you'll see...
I'M THIRSTY TOO!
What's wrong?
You know?
Maybe... not sure...
Not sure... No matter...
We'll drink together,
but not your way...
Iike an old wino
I want to be drunk with you,
so I can see you laugh.
FIRECRACKERS... FIREWORKS!
Wait... wait...
Where'd you get that?
My dad's a colonel in the army.
Shit...
Take a look...
No bullet missing?
Yeah.
YEAH, WHAT?
No, none.
All there, sure? Still 15?
15, yeah.
Well, FINE!
Dying to shoot, me too!
Blow everything sky high.
Let's do it. 7 for
you, 7 for me.
Keep one for luck.
CATCH!
FIRE! GO ON!
City's full of music.
Want to join the crowd?
No. Better here.
SPEED OK?
CAN'T HEAR,
BUT YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL!
You OK, Louisiana?
Cat Egyptian?
Abyssinian.
A gift.
Dry me, boy.
Real good you're here.
Ready to drop right off.
Never with wet hair.
Here...
throw it over the side.
Gives you nightmares.
Dump it.
I'm zonked...
Wait for me...
Wake up, gotta sleep.
You pass me my downer?
A downer!
Can't find a snug fit?
Quick, need my downer.
Too much drink. Doesn't mix.
Yes... quick...
don't wanna be left alone.
No!
Go on!
BEAT IT!
Somebody loves you. If you say:
"The sky is white," he'll say:
"But the clouds are black."
Then we'll know we're in love.
Michele... Michele... Michele...
Go on up. Tryto sleep.
Can't.
Want your downer?
Too late.
Girl doesn't love me.
The girl doesn't WHAT?
Cause you... you want love?
Like the others?
Tenderness, like the others?
Look around...
No love here!
Love takes bedrooms,
not windy sidewalks!
Got no life for it!
So forget it.
FORGET IT!
The girl, she can't stay.
Got to go!
Leave me alone...
I'm hung over.
You have to go.
All you know how to say? Go?
Think I'd be here, if not for...
a goddam reason? Go where?
My eyes are going.
Listen to me...
When I try to paint,
this eye here
bulges out of my head,
like a snail.
At the museum over there,
I wanted to see a painting...
See it again... before I'm blind.
But a fucking neon
set the eye on fire,
