OH, GOD DAMN IT.

WHERE ARE YOUR KIDS?
I SENT THEM TO MY SISTER'S.
DIDN'T WANT THEM
TO BE AROUND YOU.
( Roy sighs )
I'LL GET YOU THE MONEY.
I CAN ARRANGE IT.
BANK TRANSFER OR CASH?
I DON'T WANT YOUR FIVE GRAND.
WHAT IF I CAN
HELP YOU FIND SKIP?
YOU HEAR ME, OR YOU FALL ASLEEP
WITH YOUR EYES OPEN?
HOW CAN YOU HELP ME?
WE'LL GET TO THAT.
GET TO IT NOW.
I WANT 100 GRAND.

NUH-UH.
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.
I'LL FIND HIM WITHOUT YOU.
GOOD LUCK.
( door opens, closes )
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SELLING.
THIS.
IT'S JORGE'S.
I KNOW
EVERY NAME IN IT,
WHO AND WHAT THEY ARE.
WITHOUT ME TELLING
YOU ABOUT THAT,
YOU MAY AS WELL START
WITH THE PHONE BOOK.
OKAY.  IT'S A DEAL.
- Rachel: OVER THERE.
- Roy: WHAT?
Rachel: UNCLE LUKE.  IT WAS
AFTER SOMETHING BIG.
JORGE WENT DOWN
TO DALLAS.
I PICKED HIM UP
AT THE AIRPORT.
HE HAD TWO SUITCASES.
I DROPPED HIM OFF
IN THE ALLEY IN THE BACK
AND WAITED AT THAT BURGER STAND
FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.
WHEN JORGE CAME BACK,
HE WAS EMPTY-HANDED.
WHEN I ASKED WHERE HE WAS, HE SAID,
"VISITING UNCLE LUKE."
THREE DAYS LATER, I FIND HIM STASHING
MONEY IN SHOEBOXES.
- THE PAYOFF.
- YEAH.
IT WASN'T THE LAST TIME
THEY DID BUSINESS WITH THAT GUY.
LUKE'S THEIR FENCE.
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?
SEND YOUR KIDS TO COLLEGE.
YOU FIGURE IT OUT?
WHEN?
TOMORROW.
SKIP'S DOWNED THE LOAD.
HE'S WAITING FOR HIS MONEY.
( sighs )
THAT GIVES ME A WINDOW.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
- STAY OUT OF IT.
WHEN I KILL SKIP, THERE'LL BE A BODY.
NOTHING TO TIE YOU IN.
YOU AND THE KIDS LEAVE TOWN ANYWAY.
LET ME KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING...
( sighs )
...AND I'LL GET THE MONEY TO YOU.
PORT ARTHUR, TEXAS.
ON THE GULF COAST.
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE A KILLER.
Roy: DO YOU
BELIEVE IN THAT?
I COULD USE A CAR, TOO.
- ( drawer opens )
- ( keys clinking )
THANKS.
START PACKING.
JORGE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HE HAD.
I'D HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB.
I'D HAVE HUNG ON TO YOU.
( people chattering )
( sewing machines
whirring )
( sighs )
WHO ARE YOU?
ROY EGAN.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FROM YOU.
I WANT THE CASH
YOU'RE HOLDING FOR SKIP.
I WAS THE FOURTH GUY
IN THAT CREW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I DON'T HAVE ANY CASH.
YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE.
I CAN'T HELP YOU.
( both grunting )
( cell phone ringing )
( ringing continues )
- ( beeps )
- YEAH?
Luke:
Where the hell are you?
THIS PLACE. USED TO WORK OUT HERE.
WHY?  EVERYTHING COOL?
DON'T BOTHER COMING
FOR YOUR MONEY.
Why the fuck's that?
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
HERE ANYMORE.  IT'S GONE.
LUKE, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
Gone.
Egan took it.
BULLSHIT!  I DOWNED THE MERCH TO YOU!
YOU OWE ME THE MONEY!
IF HE STUCK YOU UP, THAT IS
YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM!
Fuck you and fuck your money!
This guy knew you.
He knew the money
was for you.
BEFORE YOU GO CRAZY,
I KNOW WHERE HE IS.
WHERE?
I'm not paying you
any more money.
You want your money, you get it.
You get it from him.
HOW DID HE GET TO YOU?
Why are you asking me?
It was your crew.
( man speaking Chinese )
( doorbell buzzing )
( all speaking Chinese )
ALL RIGHT, I'M MOVING.
EGAN'S CAMPED OUT
AT SOME DUMP ON ROSCOE IN THE VALLEY.
- HE'S GOT THE MONEY.

Announcer on TV:
Passes to Kubrick, who dribbles,

I've been calling you
for a fucking half hour.
I GOT HER.
I WANT THE MONEY.
I'VE BEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH TO LET 
HER LIVE IF YOU DISAPPOINT ME, ROY.
HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.
( sniffs )
TAKE THE 60 EAST TO AZUSA.
TWO LEFTS, PAST THE DEVELOPMENT
AND UP THE DIRT ROAD.
YOU GOT THAT?
DO YOU HEAR ME OR NOT, ROY?
