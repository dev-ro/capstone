I just wanna say
thank you to my mother.
Oh.
And to my stepmother
for being so supportive.
And a special
thanks to my daddy
for paying
for everything.
You can work
it off in the
factory, sweetheart.
And to all of my
good friends, and
my not friends,
And everyone
in between.
I love you all
for being here
just for me.
And lastly,
to the hallowed

for allowing me
to graduate.
Cheers.

Where have you been?
Irritable bowel syndrome.
I think it was
aggravated by my
social anxiety disorder.
I see you've applied
for a student
credit line,
But it looks like you've
been denied on account
of your credit history.
It shows you have
a significant amount
Of, uh, unpaid
credit card debts
totaling almost $37,000?
It's not as bad
as it looks.
Um, after my dad died,
My mom hit a really
rough patch. She was
supporting us on her own,
and she had to take
out some credit
cards in my name
and has had
some difficulty
paying them back.
But I can assure
you that it has
nothing to do
With my ability to pay
back the student loan.
That debt is still
in your name,
and the only information
we have to go on is what's
printed on this page.
I know. I just would
hope that maybe you
could see me
as something more
than just a piece
of paper.
We do see you
as more than just
a piece of paper.
You are a very bright
and beautiful girl
with a very ugly
credit history.
What's your favorite
memory of your sister?
Hm. Probably
the time she
told me
that our parents
bought me for 20 bucks
from Russian gypsies.
That they'd never
love me as mush as
the loved her.
I never said that.
Oh. Oh. She's almost
completely blind now.
The humane thing
to do would be to
put you to sleep.
Elena! Elena!
Keep her
in the kitchen.
Gracias.
Have you ever
considered the military?
It's a good way for
a young person to pay
for their education.
Uh, I don't really
think that the
military
Um, Is the right
fit for me.
No offense.
Why would I
be offended?
Uh, Ms. Bryant,
I've worked really hard
to get good grades
and to try and be
the most qualified
applicant possible.
It takes more than
good grades to get
a free ride these days.
Well, I'm not saying
I deserve a free ride.
I just--
I don't really think
it's fair if I don't
get a chance.
A lot of people
deserve a chance,
but they won't get it.
That's your first
lesson, and it's free.
Tu familia
es en Venezuela?
Si.
Tu, uh,
tu piensas,
uh, about going back?
Si.
Uh, do they like, uh,
Perros?
Si.
Yeah ?
So, where are we going?
Well, the boat's
in Fort Lauderdale.
So, uh, we should
be there, like,
in the morning.
And how are
we gonna get there?

Hey, Uncle Bob.
Hey, how's it

Not good.
Sorry about that.
I spoke to the
financial aid person
at the university.
Dressed like that?
I'm not
getting the loan.
Sweetie, you have
such a great body.
Mom, it was a woman.
Ah, well, what'd
you expect?
Of course she's not gonna
help you. You never go to
a woman if you need something.
You know, you promised me
that you were making
those payments!
What payments?
On the credit cards you
took out in my name you
swore you would pay back?
I know. When I get the
settlement from the accident,
I'm gonna give you the money.
Did you buy
a new dress today?
Yeah, yeah. It was
on sale. I got--
Mom!
Gracie, you know what?
The world just doesn't
grind to a halt
because you can't figure
out how to pay for your
own elective school.
No, I can't pay
for school because
you ruined my credit.
And you don't
pay your taxes.
And I'll give you
the money when I get
it from the settlement.
You know, you should try
tweezing just a little
bit more right here.
It'll open up
your eyes.
She doesn't
listen to me,
that's the problem.
I don't understand
your sister.
Well, I know
it's not as fancy
as you're used to,
but we got
everything you need.
The manager
at the water park is
in my elk's lodge,
so he's gonna let
you work there as
a favor to me.
While you're here,
there's not gonna be
any driving.
You can walk to
and from work.
Walking builds blisters,
and blisters build character.
So, these are the rules.
You wake up,
you make your bed,
go to work,
you show respect,
and you live
a disciplined life.
Look at me.
you don't make any trouble,
you won't find any trouble.
Take advantage
of this summer to turn
your life around, Dorian.
This is going to be the
best summer ever, right?
We 're here to have fun
and to make friends.
Because the more
you have fun,
the less it
feels like work.
I want every one of
you to ask yourself,
how am I going
to live today
in order to create
the tomorrow I am
committed to?
I gotta get
out of here.
What'd they say
about school?
They wouldn't
give me the loan.
And I have to come up
with $ 12,000 by
August 10th
or I lose my spot.
That's a lot
of blow jobs.
Sh!
And we have to be
alert at all times,
so if you have a G.I.D. --
that is right, Bonnie.
you blow your whistle
three times,
and you get that
guest in distress
out of the water!
Can't your mom
help you?
She said she would,
as soon as her
settlement money
comes in.
It's awesome.
Hey, what he's saying up
there is really serious.
You all think
this is so funny.
How much would you laugh if
someone got hurt because you
weren't paying attention?
You think a blue kid
at the bottom of the
pool is funny?
A little,
yeah, mm-hm.
We're sorry, okay?
We do take it seriously.
I should hope so.
because you, Grace,
out of everyone
Should know the importance
of trying to save a life,
especially since
you weren't even there
to save your own father.
Little bitch.
Don't let her
get to you, Grace.
All right, face forward,
stomach down, wait for
the green light.
All right, friends
of the Speedo. Hey,
welcome to the Racer.
Grab a mat and
have a great time.
Hey! Good day, huh?
No one died,
made 42 bucks
before taxes,
and I found this pair
of slamming shades.
What do you think?
They're funny.
I'm Dorian.
Grace.
Pleasure to
meet you, Grace.
I knew someone named
Grace in preschool.
And she was just sort
of good and sweet and
lovely, you know?
So, you work
here long?
Uh, yeah. Forever.
Forever.
Forever is
a long time.
So, I was wondering
if you knew
where the little
league fields were.
Um, Denton Road.
Is that far?
No.
Well, you going
in that direction?
No.
Oh, well,
that's cool. I mean,
I can walk, right?
It's not too
far, right?
No.
Have a good
day, Grace!

Come on, Timmy.
Okay, listen, people,
we don't get what
we deserve in life.
We get what we expect.
Okay, so let's all raise
our expectations, okay?
Okay.
Vic didn't mention
that you were 12.
Ah, I'm 17, bro.
Have you ever
done anything
like this before?
Oh, yeah!
West County.
I was the man.
West County, huh ?
This place is
a lot different.
A lot of people
with nothing to do,
even less
to talk about.
Always looking to
take somebody down.
And that
would be you.
You have a car?
Nah, I got a driver.
Call it!
Who? Your mom?
Nah, yours.
That's all
the info you need.
And if anything
ever goes south,
you never knew
me. Understand?
Yeah, who
are you again?
Good stop, buddy!
But next time, I wanna
see thumbs to the thigh,
knuckles to the sky, okay?
Let's make the throw.
When I finish the
inspection, I'll go
by and pick it up.
How long is
that gonna take ?
I got 30 minutes.
Hurry home.
I love you.
Yeah, I love you,
too, honey. Bye.
Is that Danielle?
Yeah.
How's she doing?
She got a sinus
infection or something.
Oh, not again.
Well, don't let
her do antibiotics.
You should have her
steam with a little
eucalyptus oil.
You know, I had a dream
about him last night.
Who?
Jim. Your husband,
My brother.
You know, do you think
he knew about us?
Do you like
being with me?
Yeah.
So don't talk
about him.
Face forward,
stomach down.
Wait for the
green light.
Honey, you don't
wanna go? You scared?
Don't be scared.
It's fine.
I'm gonna give you
a little tiny push.
It helps if you scream
all the way down.
Yeah, scream
all the way down

Ready?
Okay? One, two, three!

Donovan Street
in Moberly.
That's, like,
20 miles from here.

we can be friends.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, because I don't
know what's really
going on, yet.

Oh, we don't

We're out of here.
Uh, can you just
give me a second?
For what?
You want to maybe
just wait in the car?
Yes. That's
a great idea.
Great idea.
Nice meeting you.
You, too, Benny.
Hey. Let's go.
You have the keys?
Yes.
So, are those the kind
of people you usually
hang out with or--
I don't know,
I don't usually
hang out. Why?
Well, you just don't
really fit the type.
Oh, what's the type?
Spoiled and obnoxious
and totally removed
from reality.
Thanks.
No problem.
There you go.
You're actually
giving me 100 bucks?
We had a deal, right?
Okay. Let's go.
Let's go.
So, how much money
you need to make
for school?
I heard you
and Jean talking.
Yeah, you
shouldn't eavesdrop.
Yeah, well, you
talk pretty loud.
Look, I'm just
saying, 'cause--
You should think about
going into business
with me.
What?
Yeah!
I already
have a job.
A $4-an-hour job that
jumps to a whopping
six bucks an hour
if you can make it
through the summer
without a floater.
I mean, we can make
some real money, man.
I mean, like, new job,
New life, new car,
new clothes,
New Pomeranian
kind of money,
you know.
And we would be providing
an invaluable service
to this town.
Whoop!
Do you know that
this car could run
on hemp oil?
Oh, yeah, well, I
think regular unleaded
is probably fine
for right now.
You know,
I was thinking,
did you know that the
board of homeopathic
herbs and medicine
has found over 2,700
legitimate uses
for cannabis?
Well, did you know that
there are hundreds of
thousands of people
in jail right now
for pot possession?
I know, man! And
how absurd is that?
I mean,
pot's illegal.
Yeah, well, that is
because the tobacco
and liquor companies
wanna maintain their
monopoly. And the
prison industries
thrive on the
war against pot.
And it's far too difficult
to control, and therefore,
too difficult to tax,
and it will remain illegal
until the government
can make a profit.
Did you know that
you have to smoke about
900 joints in one sitting,
that is nine with
two zeros after it,
to kill yourself?
Yeah, but your lungs
would disintegrate
before that.
Have you ever seen
the inside of a bong?
I have. The question
is, have you?
Yes.
Let me ask you, then.
What about the millions
of glaucoma sufferers
in the world, right?
Like my poor Uncle
Freddy, who, if he
had a legit source,
could smoke a doobie
every once in a while
and wouldn't have to
wear that ridiculous
looking eye patch.
No, Uncle Freddy can just
find his own man on the
inside. I don't know.
Man on the inside, huh?
Well, what if I told
you that you just
helped me do it?
What?
Mm-hm. It wasn't,
like, scary or
frightening.
Wait, you had
drugs in my car?
Yeah. Sorry, man.
Do you have any
on you right now?
Why are you getting
so dramatic? Shit.
I'm really not
gonna go to jail
and get my car seized
just so you can sell a bit
of shitty weed for a bit
of shitty money.
I don't sell shitty
weed in or outside
of your car.
That's not
the point.
What is the point,
then? Why are you
tripping out? Be cool.
Here. I don't even
want this. This is
probably drug money.
Don't you wanna
go to college ?
Yeah, that's why I
don't wanna go to jail.
Oh, they don't put pretty
white girls with nice
smiles in prison!
Hey, virtue is its
own punishment, baby!
You broke the
law, Mrs. Berry,
and when you break
the law, it doesn't
work for you anymore.
Your honor,
if I could ask--
Mr. Jones, your client
allowed her daughter,
fourteen at the time,
to drive both of
them home.
And while in transit,
they were involved
in a car accident
that resulted in serious
damages to both public
and private property.
There's no factual
evidence as to who
was driving the car!
That girl was
driving the car.
He is lying!
I'm not lying,
your honor.
What was I wearing?
Do you remember that?
What was she wearing?
Rhonda, please,
I'm handling this.
And when I got out
And walked over,
the mother was
trying to switch
places with her.
That is not true!
ask her! Go ahead,
honey, tell 'em.
Tell the truth now.
Don't be afraid.
What happened?
Tell the judge who
was driving. Tell
the judge.
Go ahead. Who was
driving the car?
Tell the judge who
was driving the car.
Go ahead, tell him.
Yeah, tell him.
Tell him.
Go ahead. Tell him!
Taylor?
Taylor, we're
gonna be late.
What happened
with the hearing?
Oh, come on,
move your butt!
Where you guys going?
We have an appointment
to see a guy who
has a brother
Who has a friend
who has a modeling
agency in Chicago.
What happened
with the money?
Are we getting money?
Well, you know,
the guy just
got up there.
It was his word
against mine,
and he lied.
He just flat out just lied.
He didn't even blink.
He just lied.
And the judge
just believed him?
Welcome to the real
world, Gracie. That's
what men do. They lie,
and then they get
other lying men to
cover for them.
The insurance company
pays his lawyer and
gets the judge elected,
and the judge
goes duck hunting
with my lawyer.
I mean, it's just
one big scam.
Well, it's about
time! Come on.
I don't get it. Some
grandma sues McDonald's
because she spills hot coffee
on herself, and I don't get
a cent when a guy
Who's just traded in his
burro for a car practically
kills your sister and me.
Without that money, there's
no way I'm gonna have
enough for school.
Gracie, does everything
have to be about you?
Did it ever occur to you
that it affects other
people in this family?
Did you ever think
of how I feel
not having the money
to give my children
what they need,
as a mother, not
having the money
to do that?
Did it ever occur
to you how I feel?
How I feel to have
my husband killed himself?
Did it ever occur to you?
Look, Gracie, really,
everybody doesn't
go to college.
I didn't go to college,
your father didn't go,
Abraham Lincoln didn't go.
Abraham Lincoln? Mom,
what does that have
to do with anything?
I'm just trying
to say to you that
you don't have
to go to college
to get an education.
To be a doctor?
To be a doctor
you have to go
to college, Mom.
Look, can we just ask
Aunt Mindy for a loan?
No, no. Ask my sister and
have this hanging over my
head for the next 30 years? No.
What am I supposed
to do now?
Move the car
and take the dog.
Is your product good?
What?
I don't want
any complaints.
Want to try it?
Is it good?
Yeah. Bomb Kush,
it sells itself.
I need to make $ 12,000
by the end of the summer.
All right.
That can be done.
Put on your seatbelt.
I don't wanna get pulled over
because you don't think it's
chill to wear your seatbelt.
And I never wanna have
more than 35 grams in
the car at any given time.
Any more than that and it's
a felony punishable by up
to seven years in prison.
Nice. Did your homework.
Yeah. If we 're gonna do this,
then I have to minimize our
risk and maximize our gain.
Oh, you're a minor,
so you have to have
the product
and a full confession
on you at all times. And
we split profits 50/50.
I think I can find a driver
that will probably cut me
a better deal, actually.
Well, actually
you're welcome to try,
but, you know, don't bother
coming back to me when you
find out that's not true.
No, I'll stick with you.
Olli called me when I was
on the phone with Ryan,
and I had to pretend
that it was somebody else.
Taylor, come on.
Let's go.
Bye!
Who are you?
I'm Dorian.
I'm Taylor Elizabeth.
It's after Elizabeth Taylor,
but my mom wanted
to make it original.
It works.
I like this music.
It's good, right?
Yeah, it's different.
So, are you,
like, my sister's
new boyfriend?
Not yet, but maybe
you could put in a
good word for me.
Yeah, we just
work together.
All right,
jump out, frog.
Well, what are you
guys gonna go do?
Uh, something you
are not invited to.
I got the modeling
school application!
I'm gonna talk to
Aunt Mindy. Maybe
she'll sponsor you
And give us something
to go to New York.
And see the agents
and the photographers
and get your book going.
Wait, I thought you said
you hated Aunt Mindy.
I never said that. Hm?
Hello. I'm Dorian Spitz.
Let's go, Dorian.
Oh, like the swimmer
with the five gold
medals, huh?
Yeah, I think he
had seven, though,
but like, you know,
And what kind
of name is Spitz?
It's a last
name, Mom.
German.
Jewish?
Here and there.
Yeah, he works
with Grace.
Oh.
Uh, could you please
work on filling
this out?
Well, I don't really
know if I still wanna
be doing it.
French fry,
that was our plan,
and you know
you want it
as much as I do.
We should, uh,
we should go.
What are you guys
gonna go do?
Uh, we're just gonna
meet some friends,
just hang out.
Can I come with?
Absolutely not. I have
to put that conditioner
in your hair.
Oh, don't give me
that long face.
Come on, you know
everybody would kill
to be in the position
you're in.
Isn't that
right, Dorian ?
You have
very nice hair.
Yeah.
Anyways, it was a
pleasure meeting you.
Bye.
Bye.
So, your sister
seems like a,
like a cool
girl, yeah?
Yeah.
Your mom's
a little--
Um, can we just
not talk about them
right now, please?
Sure, yeah.
No, I mean,
I understand.
You can choose
your friends, you can't
choose your family, right?
Right.
All right, just keep
the engine on, okay?
Hi, there.
Your coffee, ma'am.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
No problem. Enjoy.
Tell me this is not better
than getting doused in
chlorinated piss water
For four bucks an hour.
Yeah, it's not bad.
Why are you working at the
water park if you can pull
this kind of cash ?
I gotta keep up
appearances.
I screw up one more time,
my family is gonna send
me to military school.
The kind that no one talks
about. The kind where dudes
come out with a lot more
than just a shaved head
and a new speech pattern.
What could you
possibly have done?
Refuse to carry on
my family's tradition
of profiting
from death.
Great Granddaddy Spitz
invented the
first double based
embalming fluid.
You know, and as the
male heir or whatever,
I'm expected to
carry on that legacy.
But if I make enough
money on my own,
I'm not gonna
have to do that.
You know?
That's why I knew
we should go into
business together.
I could see it on
your face, you know?
I see it
in your eyes.
You need to escape
your world just as
much as I do.
Except that
you're trying
to escape down
and I'm trying
to escape up.
No, there's no
up or down, man.
There's just
free and trapped.

Wow.
No formalities, huh?
No, no, no,
I didn't mean
to be rude or--
It's, um--
You know, I--
Yeah.
Uh, six years ago.
Uh, I was adopted.
My, uh, my parents
didn't want me to
find out,
but my sister just
hated me 'cause, uh,
'cause I didn't wear
glasses and she did.
I didn't mean
to do that.
I hate it when people do
that, like, try to match each

I know.
No, but--I'm
really--I'm sorry.
That was really
just stupid.
Do you ever think
about finding your

I've got my mom's

didn't want me,
so why would I
wanna find them?
Well, I guess your
adoptive parents had
to choose you, right?
My mom was just
stuck with me.
What are you doing?
This shirt--
This shirt is my
favorite shirt, right?
And my uncle only
lets me do laundry
once a week.
He says it, uh,

But he says it

"character."

You got a load or two
that needs cleaning?
Nah, I think I'm
okay, but thanks.
You sure?
'Cause I think my
shirt and your clothes
are really
hitting it off.
I think my shirt
even left a button
in your pocket.
How's it going?
Good.
How's it going
with you, Ben?
I'm good. I'm good.
I'm good, too.
We have a quorum.
All good.
Look, we gotta go, man.
Bobbing blue babies
are bad for business.
Time is money.
Let's go.
Let's move.
Bye.
All right,
welcome to the Racer.
Hey, Taylor,
How was it?
Oh, my God, that
thing was so much fun.
If you go off the
last one, you get
more air off the drop-off.
I'm so doing it again.
All right.
Have a good time.
Hey, Dorian.
Hey, Ben.
Don't slip.
Thanks, man.
Okay, fill 'em up.
Hey, baby beef
cakes, two o'clock.
What are you gonna do ?
Are you nervous?
Hey, you,
no funny stuff.
Whoa, ho ho!
Would it be weird
if I asked you out?
Why?
Why?
I mean, why would
that be weird?
Hey.
You came back.
Oh, yeah, what
did you expect?
Bad dates go
to the bathroom,
climb out the window.
Yeah. Well, um,
I was thinking
about that,
but, you know,
I wanted to eat first,
and my shoes
aren't really
good for climbing.
This looks really good.
Hi.
Hey.
Is, uh, Grace here?
Nope. It's just me
and my Cheerios.
Well, do you know
where she went,
by any chance?
Nope.
No. Okay.
You're taller
than I am.
Um--
Yeah, I am.
You can come in
if you want to.
Incredible. I can't
believe you've
been to Africa.
What about you?
where have you been
that you loved?
Me?
You mean, like, besides
the water park? What can
be better than that, right?
Um, no, I used
to spend Christmas
with my dad's parents
in North Carolina.
But that's when I
was pretty young, so.
And other than that,
I haven't really
racked up any frequent
flier miles, so.
That's cool,
so, I'm hanging with
a down and dirty local.
Well, I expect a real
professional guided
tour at some point.
Thank you
for dinner.
You're welcome.
I'm really sorry
that I have to run
out on you like this.
But my sister
is just stranded,
and I'm the only
one who can get her.
No, no, no, no.
I totally get it.
I totally get it.
You're being a
good sister.
Oh, wait. So,
what are my odds?
Your odds of what?
Getting a professional
guided tour.
Oh, yeah. um,
I'd say about 60/40.
All right, yeah.
I can live with that.
Okay.
Good night.
Good night.
So, was Grace supposed
to hang out with you
or something tonight?
Yeah, sort of.
Well, when she left,
she was wearing a dress,
and that girl
never wears a dress.
Oh. Well,
did she mention
where she was going?
No, she never
tells me anything.
Sometimes I think that
she doesn't even
have feelings.
You know,
when my dad died,
she didn't even cry.
Not once.
Huh.
She just, like,
moved into this
Grace zombie world
where she could
only be mad.
So, do you like Grace?
Uh, yeah. I mean,
we're friends.
But do you like her?
She's very
focused.
Is that what
you call it?
Why? What do
you call it?
Being a bitch.
Oh!
Bitch, huh?
Yeah, it's true.
Interesting.
How old are you?
Seventeen years of age.
I'm gonna be 16
in September.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Grace is almost 19.
I know.
She's getting old.
Very.
well, don't you
two look cozy.
So, what is the
big emergency?
Whoa. Were you on, like,
a date or something?
It's none of
your business.
Uh, yeah, I think it
is my business when it
affects our cash flow, okay?
Yeah, cash flow.
Let's go. Let's
get in the car.
No can do.
too late.
Too late?
Come on, are
you kidding me?
No, the dude
found someone else.
This is a 24/7 gig.
People want what
they want when they
want it. All right?
So maybe I should just
get, like, a scooter or
bike or something
if I have to inconvenience
you every time it's
none of my business
and you're wearing
a dress and heels and--
We have a bike
outside if you want it.
That would be great.
I'd really appreciate
that. I'd love that.
So, do you still
need a ride?
No. I'm fine.
You're fine. Okay.
So happy
I came home then.
Okay, good night.
Right, hold on.
maybe, um,
could you give
me, like, a lift
to my uncle's house?
How did you get here?
I used my legs.
I walked.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Good night.
Mm-hm.
Are you guys
selling drugs?
Do you color
your hair?
We have it
professionally highlighted.
Fifteen? That's--
that's a little young.
Agents said it
would warm up her
complexion a little bit.
See? And it has. They
think that maybe she could
get a shampoo commercial.
You know, those
things run forever.
Okay, why don't you
tell your aunt, um,
why you wanna
be a model and
show her your book?
And I 'II go
make some coffee.
Oh, Rhonda, don't be
ridiculous. You've never
even been in my kitchen.
I can handle it.
Sisters. You know,
sometimes--
So.
Oh. Look at you.
So precious.
So, do you
wanna be a model,
or does your mom want
you to be a model?
Well, I think
it would open
new windows for me
and build
my self-esteem.
Good. Sounds great.
Oh, you look darling
here. Look at you.
And you don't think
these modeling schools
are one big scam?
Well, Amber Valetta
went to modeling school.
Oh, she did?
I don't know
who that is.
She's a famous model.
Oh. I've never
heard of her.
Why doesn't you mother
just get her boyfriend
to pay for everything?
She doesn't have one.
Oh, look
at that smile!
Oh! Gorgeous!
did you know that when
you were a little girl,
I would ask your mother
to let you go on trips with
me, and she always said no?
She thought she
was protecting you,
like I could do
anything more harmful
than what she's doing.
Love that shot.
I think she knows
that she made a mistake.
A mistake? Is that what
she's calling it today?
She apologized to Grace.
Yeah, well, why is
she still doing it?
Oh, that's a
little suggestive.
I don't think she is.
You know, it's one thing
for her to destroy her
own marriage,
but she's got to ruin
your Uncle Bob's as well.
Are you talking about
the credit cards she
took out in Grace's name?
You know, it's,
it's not surprising
that I never
got remarried.
Men are pigs.
Love that.
Did mom have an
affair with Uncle Bob?
Oh, my goodness.
Your father loved
you very much.
He loved you
and your sister.
It's important
that you know that.
And if he had
any issues,
they were all with
your mother's behavior.
Yeah, we were teaching
English in this, like,
tiny little village,
and these kids were
just amazing, you know,
like little sponges,
with their eyes just
absorbing everything.
I mean, I went away
speaking like, maybe
five words of Afrikaans,
and they were just,
like, babbling away
in English.
Like, they knew
fluent English.
It was crazy.
These photos
are incredible.
Thank you.
Who's that?
Um, that's Melanie.
She was in the
program with me.
This is weird.
What?
This is weird.
Usually when I
meet a girl, um,
it's always weird at
first, but I feel oddly
comfortable with you.
I thought you just
said it was weird.
It is.
Because it isn't.
You know what
I'm saying?
Yeah.
Do you wanna get that?
Uh--
Yey, it's Grace, I'm busy.
So leave a message.
Dorian, she's not here.
Of course she isn't.
That bike used
to be Grace's.
It's nice. It's red.
So, where you
going tonight?
I just gotta go
do some stuff.
Think you could
take me with you?
Uh, no. I don't think
that's a good idea.
Look, my mom's
not home all night,
and I really don't feel
like being left alone.
Just--just don't
talk to anyone, okay?
And if anyone talks
to you, pretend like
you don't speak English.
Just wait here. I'm
only gonna be a second.
just stay here, okay?
Hey, look
in my shorts.
No, not those
ho-bag shorts.
Shut up, bitch.
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
Come here.
Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!
all right! Whoo!
Dorian, look in
my blue jean shorts.
right there.
Those?
Yeah, right there.
Is that enough?
No, the condom
doesn't count.
Ow! Derek,
you little bitch!
I 'II bust your nuts
if you do that again.
I 'II bust a
nut on you.
Come on, Dorian.
She knows
she wants me.
I know I have some
cash in here somewhere.
But I can't find it.
Okay, um,
you can touch my
boob if you want to.
Uh--
I try not to mix
business with pleasure,
but thank you.
I appreciate it.
Dorian, come on!
I mean, you know
I'm having this
house party.
Everybody's having
fun. We just want
to smoke down.
You just have
to touch my boob,
and it'll all be over,
and I 'II get high,
and it'll be good.
It'll be great,
regardless, uh,
boob touching is just--
wasn't really
on my schedule
today, but, uh--
All right.
Look, I'm just gonna
go get some money.
Wait here, all right?
Sure.
Don't slip.
You're very wet.
Hey. So,
my buddies
over there
told me that
I wouldn't be
able to come over
and start a conversation
with the most beautiful
girl in the room.
What are we gonna do
with the $ 100 we're
gonna win?
I'm Ryan.
Taylor.
Sorry, I'm a
little bit drunk.
You're beautiful.
Thank you.
What are you drinking?
Vodka.
How old are you?
Eighteen.
Are you gonna
be 18 tomorrow?
Oh, my bad.
Oh, no, no, it's,
it's, uh, all good.
You guys come on in.
I was just
leaving, actually.
Just have a good
time, man. Use a
rubber, be safe.
Sure thing.
You all right?
Yeah.
Somebody in here.
Taylor!
Yo, dude.
Somebody in here.
Let's go. Put your
shirt on! Let's go!
It's okay, Dorian.
She's fine.
Listen to her.
Dude, she's 15
though, all right?
Are you a cop?
Are you a child
molester? Let's go.
Dude, get out of here!
You'd better get
out of here, bitch!
Curly-haired faggot!

15-year-olds.

This isn't over!
Cami, I'm gonna

just have fun?

Hi, Penny.
Taylor? Girls?
Taylor?
Gracie!
Girls?
Grace ?
Oh, my God! Are you
All right? What the
hell happened here ?
Get off!
And why is he here?
We know about
your affair.
What affair?
Aunt Mindy told me
everything. How dad killed
Himself because he found out.
You know, of all
the people to
screw, Mom,
You had to choose
our father's brother?
Look, your Aunt
Mindy, she's--she's
a little bit crazy,
she says things. She's very
jealous because I have
kids and she doesn't.
Look, did you
have an affair,
yes or no?
It's not that simple.
Yes or no ?
It is simple.
I 'II see you
guys later, okay?
Your father
and I had a very
complicated relationship.
I could see how screwing
his brother would make
things complicated.
There's a lot of
things you don't know.
Yeah, well, you know what
I know? I know that
I don't like you,
and that there's nothing
about us that's the
same, thank God.
When your sister was
three, I got pregnant.
Your father made me have
an abortion, and he never
touched me again after that.
Why didn't you
get a divorce?
Because I didn't
have that option.
That is such bullshit!
You are such a liar!
You are so young, Grace,
I had two kids under six.
I had no money, I had no job,
I had no family. Where was
I supposed to go?
And I--your father was
so deeply unhappy--
Just blame it on Dad!
Blame everything on him!
I'm telling you
that I couldn't leave.
And you were
everything to us.
You were everything!
You love us so much!
I found it Mom! Look!
You stole
money from us.
$67,000 that he left
for us in our accounts.
All the money he spent
his life working for,
and you just
blew through it
with your stupid shit!
That's not what
happened. That's not
what happened, sweetie!
I swear to God.
I hired a contractor,
a guy from St. Louis.
Shut up! You're
so full of it!
No, I won't shut up!
I was gonna flip
the house and make
a lot more,
and that way you could
have gone to college.
He left with it all!
And I'm sure you slept
with him, too, right?
No, I didn't or
he'd still be
here, Grace.
Look, I'm--
I did the best I could.
I'm sorry it
didn't work out.
I tried to help.
You know what would
help? Us having a
father would help.
It would help a lot.

You know, I'm not gonna

with you right now, okay?
Fall apart
on your own time.
Do you understand
that he's never ever
in his whole life
gonna understand
how special you are?
You are so smart and,
and, and beautiful
and cool
and fun to hang
out with, all right?
And you've gone through so
much in your life, and he
hasn't struggled a single day!
He hasn't worked
for anything that
he has.
He's gotten everything
that he has from
his parents!
Oh, yeah, and
you're so different?
Well, I'm doing
something about it.
How? By selling
a little pot?
I mean, what are
you running away from
that is so horrible?
What, your parents'
expectations? Is that what?
Because they were just--
were so corrupt
and so shallow
that they always
gave you everything
you ever wanted.

Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
So, it's-it's--
it's nice to meet you.
Yeah.
Did they give you
lots of presents
at Christmas?
Yeah.
That's good.
My parents gave
us one present,
and it was always
something you couldn't
play with.
Like underwear.
So, why did you--
I was 15.
And my parents were
really religious,
and they said
that the baby
was God's gift
to another family.
And that I
was just a vessel
and that I had to do
what God intended.
And after it
was all over, uh,
no one ever talked
about it again.
Did you believe that?
What?
That I wasn't meant
to be with you.
I--I tried not
to think about it.
Did you believe it?
I was--I was 15.
You don't belong
to me, Dorian.
I'd better get
back inside.
They only give me
10 minutes and, uh--
Sure.
I've never been good
at keeping a job.
Me, either.
I hope things
work out for you.

for work.
Well, he's your
friend, isn't he?

footprints on
our hearts.

a really fun job.

It was nice to
meet you, Grace.
See ya.

No.
Are you?
No.

mess. Someone I met
on the internet.
Are you okay?
Do you have to go
to the hospital?
No.
Yey, what happened
to your hair?
I chopped it off.
Whoa.
You like it?
Yeah, it looks good.
Where should we go ?
I don't know.
I can't go home
'cause my uncle
knows what we're doing.
Yeah, so does my mom.
We could go
to Atlantic City.

about a place
that would be open.
All right, well,

something to you, right?

I say it's worth
about $7,394.
And, uh,
Let's see.
Twenty-two cents.
