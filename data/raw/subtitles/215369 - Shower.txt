"5'9", 165lbs., oily skin."
" Please choose shower length:
3, 5, or 7 minutes."
What do you think about my idea?
Really!
The idea itself is worth millions!
Listen to me:
The pace of our lives
is getting faster evey day.
Who can afford to spend
their whole day in a bathhouse?
Look at the fast-food stores:
A new one opens evey day!
They all make money!
Know why? They're fast!
Whoever listens to me
will make a fortune on this one.
Give me a break.
If you're such a big shot...
fiix the neon sign
you installed for me!
Old man, you know
I always fulfiill my obligations.
"Your obligations"!
I've already waited three months!
You have to understand...
there's been an increase
in the price of materials.
You're going to have to come up
with some more money...
to make the light operational.
Lie down!
"The Way to Success"
" Bathhouse"
" Big Legs" has escaped!
Where'd he go?
There he is.
There he is.
Don't move, don't move.
Where?
There?
No, over here!
Older brother...
Where's Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Erming...
Erming...
Erming, what does
this picture you sent me mean?
Dad's sleeping, and this is me.
Why did you send it to me?
I missed you.
You scared me.
I thought that Dad...
Do you concede defeat?
I'll beat you again tomorrow.
Hey, I'm not worried.
Tomorrow I'll bring Godzilla.
Bring him on!
Take care.
We'll see!
See you tomorrow.
You're back on business?
Uh, no.
I came to see you and Erming.
Can you still eat northern food?
Yeah, it's delicious.
Can you get
this kind of noodles down south?
Once in a while.
The sauce is no good, though.
How have you been?
All right.
I can eat,
I can sleep and I can work.
I sent him this!
Mr. Liu! Mr. Liu!
It makes me happy that you had
a chance to see your brother.
Relax. Loosen up.
Easy, easy.
There you go.
Ty the shoulder now.
Hey, much better!
You and your wife...
always coming to blows
over the littlest things!
That bitch!
No matter how nice I am,
she always beats on me!
Hey, Daming.
Is that you?
When did you come back?
Today.
Long time no see!
What brings you home?
Just visiting.
I'll leave you guys alone.
See you tomorrow.
Mr. Liu, thanks so much.
- Don't mention it.
- Bye!
Let's go and change.
Hello. It's me.
Nothing serious.
Eveything's fiine.
I misunderstood.
I'll be home
in a couple of days.
Okay. Bye.
Want to race?
Race!
One, two...
three!
Erming, look!
I won!
That doesn't count!
Let's go.
Why don't you take a bath?
I'm okay.
Are you sure?
I can fiill the tubs.
I've gotten used to showers.
Done.
Good morning.
Oh, hi there.
Hey, how's eveyone?
Meet you inside?
Mr. Liu! Good morning.
Morning.
I don't believe this!
Cricket-fiighting this early?
Who's fiighting who?
Boss, he wants a back scrub.
I'll be right over.
That doesn't count!
Why not? I won.
Don't be a sore loser!
What have you been feeding him?
Nothing special.
Just tell the truth.
You fed him ant eggs,
didn't you?
I did not!
You didn't?
Then why is he so energetic?
I'm no fool!
Even Godzilla isn't that tough.
That kind of stamina is impossible.
I've been training him.
Bullshit!
He's on steroids!
If he were a swimmer, he'd be banned
from competition for four years!
You're the coach.
You'd be banned for a year!
Oh, you're the only one
who can win?
If you can't take losing,
don't play!
Are you saying
I'm afraid of you?
This type of conduct
is unsportsmanlike and immoral.
I'm not talking to you again.
Hear me?
I'm not going to play
with you anymore!
Who cares!
We'll just have a bath
to seal our victoy.
You should be ashamed of yourself
at your age, you cheater!
What's going on?
I've put up with your tricks
for long enough!
Okay, okay.
Look at the smug expression
on his face!
You'll get yours.
Hi, here for a bath?
I came to see you.
What's up?
I didn't get a chance
to talk to you yesterday.
There's some things
we need to discuss.
Okay.
I've got a new idea,
Daming.
This is serious business.
I'll have fiifty hot-dog carts.
I'll set them up
on all the busiest street corners.
A hot dog and a soda
is a standard combination.
Ten yuan for a hot dog and soda.
Eveyone can afford it!
It's almost too easy!
I've been working
on the business plan for a year.
Each cart can do over 50,000 yuan
in business a year.
With 50 carts...
we're looking at about
3 million yuan in business a year.
I even have a name:
"The Big Dog."
Each cart will have a " Big Dog" logo
and a good-luck charm.
What do you think?
Sounds good.
I'm a little short of money.
I have other ideas, even better than this one.
All I need is an investor.
All of these ideas
are moneymakers!
Oh, I forgot.
Your dad asked me to repair
the neon sign the other day.
The price has gone up.
He needs to add
another 1,200 yuan.
41, 42, 43...
44, 45, 46...
47, 48, 49...
You're two seconds short
of the record!
Hezheng gave me an additional bill
for the neon sign: 1,200 yuan.
That little weasel!
He doesn't fiinish what he starts,
and he still thinks he can cheat me.
- Think you can beat me?
- Yeah!
One, two...
three!
I'll go buy
my ticket home tomorrow...
I won. I won!
- Hi!
- Hi! Where are you off to?
- We're going to a movie.
- See you around.
Erming, lean back.
Dad!
Dad! Dad!
What are you yelling about!
Dad, I bought this for you.
- Come and ty it out.
- Okay.
Get up, Erming.
Lean back, Dad.
This is a back massager.
Here's the remote control.
It feels great.
Yeah, great.
Thanks, son.
I'll go get my ticket now.
Go ahead.
I want to go too.
Okay.
Let's go. Erming.
Come on, Erming.
Let's go.
Stop it! Erming!
What the hell are you doing?
Quit it, Erming!
I'm sory.
That's enough now.
Get out of here!
The next available ticket
is at 10:10 tomorrow morning.
That's fiine.
Please fiill out
the reservation form.
Please check to make sure
it's all correct.
He hasn't shown up, has he?
I'll keep looking.
Did you fiind him?
No.
- Did you call the police?
- Yes.
They'll fiind him.
Mr. Liu, don't wory too much.
All you can do is wait.
Have some water.
Hey, where are you going?
Go on, follow him!
Why are you following me?
Where are you going?
Where am I going?
I'm looking for my son!
I'll go with you.
You're not needed here.
Go away!
Go the hell back to Shenzhen.
You're his older brother.
Look what you've done!
If you aren't willing
to take care of him...
don't take him out with you!
You don't care about him at all.
Tell me, why the hell
did you come back? Why?
I came to see you.
You came to see if I was dead!
I know that you don't respect me
or what I do.
I've done this all of my life
and I do it well.
Evey time I see an old customer,
I'm happy.
You want to do big things.
You want to make big money.
Go ahead!
Erming and I are fiine without you.
Why did you come back?
I've already lost one son.
I can't lose you both!
"Closed"
"Open"
Where did he go?
Who knows?
He came back covered with dirt.
At least you know that
he can fiind his own way home.
You won't need to wory
so much next time.
It's been so many years.
This is the fiirst time...
He's grown up now.
There will be more problems
like this.
These houses are the same as they were
when I was a kid. Nothing's changed.
They're much older now.
They don't even keep out
the rain anymore.
They just need to be fiixed up.
These houses are like old people.
No matter how hard
you ty to fiix them up...
they're still old.
They're still special.
This is where I've spent my life.
Go on inside.
You'll catch a cold!
Are you okay?
I'm fiine.
Master Liu!
Dad, take some medicine.
You'd better go see a doctor.
No. I'm fiine.
I've just got a cold.
Nothing serious.
Are we opening today?
Why not?
I'll be out in a minute.
Dad, get some rest.
Erming and I
will take care of eveything.
Good morning.
Are you taking over
for your dad?
No. He's not
feeling well today.
What's wrong with him?
He caught a bit of a cold
last night.
He ought to take
better care of himself.
He's not a young man.
I've kept the usual place
open for you.
Hello.
Stop! Stop singing!
You're making me crazy!
This is a public bath,
not a karaoke room!
If you want to practice
your terrible singing, go the hell home!
What?
What are you doing!
Mr. Zhang!
Your wife is at the front door
cursing and looking for you!
Let her curse.
I'm staying right here!
You goddamn loser!
You think you're safe in there?
You think you've escaped?
You think I won't come in there
after you, don't you?
No! You don't have the balls!
You bastard!
You'd better never come out!
Let's see how life in the bathhouse is!
Fine!
Erming. Come over here.
Has she left yet?
I knew that she didn't have
the nerve to come in.
Where are my clothes?
Who took my clothes?
I did.
Give them back.
I gave them to her.
Who told you
to give them to her?
She did.
Goddamn bitch!
She needs a good whipping!
Yeah! A good whipping!
Dad, drink this
and get a good sweat going.
Sory I made you waste
your return ticket.
No problem.
I'm all right.
Go back home
and get back to work.
" Haircut"
"Shower"
" Fire cups"
" Massage"
" Back scrub" " Pedicure"
Don't buy more food
than you can cary.
All that food.
No wonder your shoulder hurts.
I bought two new crickets.
Wanna have a look?
No. I wouldn't dare!
Your crickets are so great.
What if I can't take
my eyes off them?
I'm not begging you.
What a sore loser!
You still can't admit defeat.
I can't believe
you have time for a bath.
I have some free time today.
Locker number three.
Okay. See you.
- Right, talk to you later.
- Okay.
It's for real this time.
They've already had
a formal meeting.
By the end of October...
the whole district
is going to be torn down.
Be prepared.
Offiicial notifiication
should be vey soon.
Sory, I've got to go.
- Will the three of you be bathing?
- Yes.
He has to be here.
His car is parked outside!
Go check the bathroom.
Did you think you could hide?
Give me another couple of days.
Please!
Shut up!
We're gonna settle this now!
Please!
I'm not hiding from you.
I can't go outside like this.
Just let me get dressed!
Just give me two more days.
Stop it!
What's going on?
What do the three of you
think you're doing?
He owes me money.
That has nothing to do with me.
Right now, he's in my place
and he's my customer.
Inside these walls,
I'm responsible for him.
If you want to take a bath,
that's fiine.
If you want to start trouble,
that's not okay.
You're right.
We'll wait outside.
Listen, you little asshole...
if I don't get my money today,
you'll regret it big-time.
Let's go.
I think it's time
that you stopped dreaming...
and got a real job.
Take these 20,000 yuan
and take care of the problems at hand.
- Thanks so much. I'm sory.
- No problem.
- I'll pay you back as soon as I have money.
- Okay, get going.
Thanks a lot.
Dad, isn't it true that
this area is going to be torn down?
That's what they say.
They've been talking
about it for so long...
I don't know what to believe.
They're going to build
high-rise buildings here?
I heard it's a shopping mall.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
We'll take it one step at a time.
I can't stand it anymore!
She's on my back all the time.
I've had it!
I'm going to divorce her.
I mean it this time.
Is it okay if I live here
for a couple of days?
No problem.
Go grab your usual spot.
I'll go grab a bottle.
We'll have a drink
and talk about it.
What's the real problem
between you two?
I don't know how to say it.
I'm afraid you'll laugh.
It started two years ago.
She went to take a shower
at the public bath.
She wore the gold necklace I gave her.
She used to wear it evey day.
It was a wedding present I gave her.
As soon as she's naked,
along comes a thief.
The thief grabbed the necklace
from her and ran outside.
The thief thought that
there was no chance...
that a naked woman would chase him.
But guess what.
My wife did!
The street was packed with people.
No one had ever witnessed
a scene like that.
Imagine this:
A woman, totally nude...
yelling and chasing someone
down the street!
The thief never expected this
and practically froze with fright.
Running as he looked
over his shoulder...
the thief tripped over the curb.
My wife pounced on him,
grabbed the necklace and cursed him out.
Man, did word travel fast!
I heard about it right away.
You know what?
She came home and proudly
told me the stoy herself!
She thought she was a hero.
I was so mad I slapped her.
I told her that she had lost
the little face that our family had.
Shut the fuck up!
From then on,
our marriage has been in shambles.
You know,
in Northwest China...
there are some areas so dy...
it doesn't even rain once a year.
People don't bathe there.
It's not that they don't want to.
There's just not enough water.
The well is dried up.
Go home
and come back next week.
What do we do?
We only have two days.
Do we have any grain left?
Not much.
Barely enough to eat.
Go.
There is one special local custom.
Young girls must take a bath...
on the evening
before their wedding day.
That girl was Erming's mother.
I've got to be honest.
I can't get hard anymore.
Since then,
evey time I see her...
I can't...
There's nothing I can do.
I just can't.
The only thing I can do
is get divorced.
- Help me out with something.
- Sure. What?
TakeJinhao out to dinner after work.
I have an idea.
Okay.
Hi, Dad.
- How was dinner?
- Great.
Go have a good hot bath.
I put some special medicine
into the pool.
It should take care of your problem.
Really?
I've tried eveything!
This medicine is vey special.
Hury up.
The water's getting cold.
All right.
Erming, let's go.
Dad, can I go with you guys?
Okay. Let's go.
Tired? Let's sit and talk.
You're out of shape.
You should exercise more often.
The doctor says that kid...
has a minor psychological problem.
He can't get up the nerve
to sing in front of people.
Are you going to sing or not?
If you can't sing, let other people
have their turn to rehearse.
Dad, I'll come back
to see you and Erming often.
I'm okay.
Don't take what I said
the other day too seriously.
I was angy.
Erming and I are fiine.
You have things to take care of
at your new home.
Next time, bring your wife back.
I'd love to meet her.
Okay.
48, 49, 50...
51, 52, 53.
I beat the record!
Dad, let me scrub your back for you.
Hold on a second.
I'll be right back.
Don't wory.
I'll be home soon.
Another two days.
Okay. Bye.
Dad, ready?
Dad!
For a period of fiive months...
this specially constructed shell
will protect the beetle larva.
The shell will provide
the perfect environment for development.
After the larva is hatched...
there will be
a four-month development period.
The ugly larva will eventually grow...
into a beautiful beetle.
The body of the dead mother
lies by the side of the shell.
She has worked hard and
ultimately sacrifiiced her own life...
to ensure the life of her offspring.
She will forever lie
in a grave of her own construction.
The larva's destiny
is out of her hands.
A drought could make
all her work for naught.
The small beetle faces
the same dangers as the giant elephant.
Only time will tell...
if the fruit of her mother's labor
will survive the whims of nature.
That night...
darkness brings a heavy downpour...
refreshing the dry plain.
The plain is refreshed...
greatly increasing
the chance of survival...
for the fruit of a parent's labor.
We're not opening today,
Erming.
Stop working.
We're closed.
Erming!
Dad's gone.
Dad's not coming back.
He's dead!
Our dad is gone?
Erming!
What are you going to do?
They are going
to tear down this place anyway.
I'll take Erming to live with me.
I can't take him right away.
I've got to arrange things fiirst.
I've got to make sure that my wife
is prepared to accept the situation.
Erming could stay with us for a while.
We can take care of him.
No, that would be too much trouble.
What are you talking about, "trouble"?
We'd be happy to look after him.
I think that it would be better...
if he left this environment
for a while.
Don't wory.
I'll fiigure something out.
My dad gave me these.
Dad said that...
they had to travel
to a faraway lake...
just to take a bath.
You can bring these
with you tomorrow.
Erming.
Yes, I'll be back
for him in two months.
Thanks vey much.
Don't wory.
We'll take good care of him.
Erming, please listen to the nurses.
I'll be back to pick you up soon.
Erming.
Good-bye.
What are you doing?
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone! Dad!
Erming.
Erming.
I didn't make my flight.
Dad passed away.
My father passed away!
I don't know.
Nothing seemed wrong.
I was about to scrub his back...
when you called.
He passed away
while I was talking to you.
It was so unexpected.
He had just told me...
to bring you back for a visit.
It happened so fast.
I still can't believe it.
Actually, he'd been sick
for a long time.
I had no idea.
There's something else
I need to tell you.
My brother's retarded.
I should have told you earlier.
I wanted to,
but I just couldn't.
I'm so sory.
Now my dad's gone.
What do we do about my brother?
I have to take care of him.
I want to bring him back, okay?
Hello?
"Open"
Erming, I'll scrub his back.
You go welcome our customers.
Good morning.
Come in!
Here's your tea.
What, no one to compete with?
Nobody plays
with crickets anymore.
Where's Mr. Wu?
I haven't seen him for a long time.
Didn't you hear?
All of his crickets got crushed!
How did that happen?
It's like this:
His neighbors were moving.
The movers knocked down his wall.
The wall crushed all his crickets.
He was so upset,
he got sick and hasn't gotten over it.
Want to race?
One, two, three!
Why are you worying about the light?
The whole street is being torn down.
Your dad always wanted
to have it working.
I had to make it light up once
before it was too late.
" Neighborhood Culture Party"
Next, a round of applause
for "O Sole Mio"...
performed by Miaozhuang.
Are you going to sing or not?
Next! Next!
Where are you moving to?
Fangzhuang area.
That's not too bad.
I'm moving to Daxing.
- Quite far from downtown, isn't it?
- That's right.
Cricket-fiighting opponents
won't be that easy to fiind.
I've thought about it.
I'm not going to raise
any more crickets.
Why not?
You don't know?
What?
Crickets can't survive
in multistoy buildings.
Really?
I'm serious.
I know someone who moved
to live in a high-rise last year.
Guess what.
As soon as they left
the ground floor...
all his crickets died!
If he had known,
he would have set them all free.
I didn't know.
Well, no more fun in the future.
Fun? I don't wory about that.
I wory about whether...
the new community
has a bathhouse.
If not, where will we go
to take a nice bath?
- Am I right?
- Right!
We bought a gas heater
and will install it in our new house.
Then we can take
romantic private showers at home.
Shut up! Romantic!
Taking a bath here
is a lot more luxurious.
Yeah! It's so nice and warm here
and there's so much laughter.
What are you doing?
What?
He's crazy!
Are you out of your mind?
- We're here to help with the move.
- What are you doing?
Erming!
What's the matter?
We're just movers.
What's going on?
Erming! Erming!
Dad told me they were going...
to take a bath in a faraway lake.
This was a very special
and holy Tibetan lake.
The water not only washes
your body...
but also your soul.
The lake can cure all sorts
of physical and spiritual ills.
Anyone who is religious
must make a pilgrimage to the lake...
once in a lifetime.
The old woman and her granddaughter...
lived very, very far from the lake
and had to walk for many months.
Finally, the weather turned cold...
and the little girl thought that
she couldn't go any further.
She asked her granny,
'Are we almost there?"
Granny said, 'Almost. "
The little girl asked again...
"Isn't it too cold to take a bath?"
Granny said...
"This is a special kind of bath.
We can only make this pilgrimage
at certain times.
The next time won't be for 12 years.
I'm afraid I will no longer
be alive then.
We must reach the lake
before the end of this year. "
Sometimes a simple thing
like taking a bath can be so diffiicult!
I understand you don't want to leave...
but the bathhouse
is going to be torn down.
It's just like Dad leaving us.
You've got to face it.
It's hard for me too.
I've been vey selfiish
and never told my wife about you.
I'm not quite sure what she thinks.
But no matter what...
we're not leaving
each other ever again.
Being together is
the most important thing.
I think Dad would be vey happy
if he knew.
