Based on a novel by
Henri Murger
Merde.
Have I hurt myself?
My God!
Blood!
Going well, Marcel?
- No.
What do you think, with the
middle of my face smashed in?
Some red...
These glasses are smaller than
a drunkard's hallucinations.
What did the publisher say?
Any luck? - No. The swine!
Claimed it was too long,
he demanded cuts -
but without promising or
advancing me a thing... The lout!
Why not let me read it?
You? - Me.
You can read?
Are you joking?
I went to grammar school in Mon√ßao
before coming to Paris.
I can read it in the evening
before retiring.
Why not?
You'll give me
the people's appraisal -
and put the publishers to shame.
"The Avenger". A play in 21 acts,
by Marcel Marx.
EVICTION NOTICE
Good morning, Monsieur Marcel.
You do recall that it is the eighth?
So soon?
Time passes fast as a deer.
You're a bit slow
in vacating the premises.
It is already half-past eleven -
and the new tenant
may arrive at any moment.
Allow me to fetch a moving van.
By all means -
but first there is
a minor formality to see to.
The three months' rent.
I'm certain you agree.
- But of course.
Then kindly into my office
and I will give you a receipt.
When I return.
- Why not now?
I must go to the bank. I don't go
around carrying that kind of money.
I see... No cash. Permit me,
then, to take charge of -
what you're carrying
so it doesn't burden you.
You think I'd carry off
my belongings in a bag?
Those are the rules.
You are not to remove so much as
a single hair until the rent is paid.
These are not hairs but shirts
that I am taking to be ironed -
at he laundry
just next door to the bank.
Please do not misunderstand me -
but experience has shaken
my faith in tenants.
Hugo had best
accompany you to the bank.
See this man? He's been
casing the bank for three days now.
I live nearby... His companion is
around the corner in a Alfa Romeo -
reading Le Monde.
He has the paper upside down.
Of course I may be mistaken,
but I wish to do my duty.
What do you suppose is in the bag?
My apartment,
has it been vacated?
Not yet, Monsieur Schaunard,
but very soon.
The previous tenant has just gone
to fetch a moving van.
In the meanwhile, you may put
your furniture in the yard.
I am afraid -
that it will rain
and my furniture will be ruined.
You will forgive me
if I ask your profession -
but you neglected to note it
in the lease.
Leave the piano and return at once
to my old lodgings -
to fetch the rest of my
precious furnishings and -
works of art.
From the Ministry of War.
It's just arrived by courier.
From the Ministry of War...
It must be the pension -
I've been seeking all these years.
At last, some recognition
of my achievements.
Dear Monsieur Bernard,
courtesy demands that I inform you -
of my having landed
in such a predicament -
that I am unable at this time
to observe the custom -
requiring me to pay my rent,
especially when it's due.
Until this morning I had hoped to
honor this lovely day -
by paying my rent.
Delusion!
As I slept
cradled in false certainty, -
misfortune, ananke in Greek,
dashed my hopes.
Sizable sums on which I had counted
were not forthcoming -
but our beautiful France and I
will see better days -
have no doubt of that.
The moment we do, -
I shall hasten to inform you of it -
and to remove from my lodgings
the precious possessions -
I leave to your safekeeping
and the law's -
which restrains you
from selling them for one year.
Until then you are at liberty
to use the luxurious flat -
in which I have resided.
In affirmation of my consent, I here
affix my signature. Marcel Marx.
Two half-trouts.
- Yes, sir.
That was a curious order.
On the contrary. This method yields
on average a quarter more -
than when
a full portion is ordered.
Where is my order?
Unfortunately the last of the trout
went to this gentleman here.
May I invite you
to partake of this course with me?
I would not deprive you
what is yours, sir.
You will deprive me, then, of the
pleasure of expressing my good will?
That being the case, sir, then...
Permit me to refrain from
serving you the head.
That I couldn't allow.
For if the head is
man's noblest appendage -
it is the most unpleasant
part of a trout.
Two heads...
This trout is bicephalic,
a word coming from the Greek -
and meaning...
precisely this.
However, I harbor no regrets
about eating this phenomenon.
The sauce was excellent.
True.
It was prepared
in the city of Bearn -
and its fine reputation
is richly deserved.
You seem very learned.
You are not from here? - No.
I come from Albania -
and have lived in Paris
only three years now.
Yet you have already mastered
our language.
My nurse was French,
from Barcelona.
My name is Rodolfo -
and I am a painter.
Marcel Marx, author.
May I offer you a bottle of wine?
Only on condition -
that I see to the coffee
and accouterments.
As a painter, don't you think -
that Malevitch's
black square on white -
is as lethal a blow to painting as -
the school of Vienna - Schoenberg,
Berg, Webern and others -
is to music?
Let's go!
I live nearby.
We may continue
our discussion there.
I descended
the impassive river -
unguided now
by the bargemen's lines.
Howling Indians
had struck them down -
and nailed them naked
to colored Stakes.
He's beautiful, Rimbaud.
Here we are.
Strange, the key is in the lock, -
although I put it
in my pocket this morning -
where it is still.
Witchery!
Two keys.
A violin...
this is not where I live after all.
May I be of any assistance?
I am mistaken.
This is not my home.
I ask your pardon
on my friend's behalf.
He is drunk as a pig.
We are home after all...
Is that not my finery?
And these?
My Turkish slippers...
given to me by beloved hands?
In consequence, Marcel Marx is
obligated to vacate the premises -
by noon of February eighth...
And am I not the Marcel Marx -
the landlord has evicted...?
The situation is as follows.
By law, the premises are mine -
for you have been evicted -
and I have paid in advance.
For the premises -
not the furnishings. If I pay up,
I may legally remove them.
I would, were it possible,
even do so illegally.
Thus, you have furnishings
but no lodgings, -
and I have lodgings
but no furniture. - Precisely.
The room pleases me.
And me? It never pleased me more.
Pardon? - Never so much as now.
I do know what I'm saying.
What say you
we irrigate this explanation?
What a great pipe you have.
I have yet a handsomer one
for when I am in society.
Would you care to try it?
- With pleasure.
You appear to be
a man of musical bent.
A composer.
I am writing a work called -
"The Influence of Blue -
on the Arts".
I can't see you now.
Why not?
Good morning.
Mademoiselle.
There is my answer.
- I understand.
Just the same, you might
lend me a thousand francs.
I'm out of colors -
and unable to complete
my masterpiece.
You ask no small thing.
I'm temporarily broke.
Couldn't you borrow it
from the girl?
That would not do.
Not yet. We met only yesterday.
And Schaunard?
- Haven't seen him all week.
Good-bye.
Where are you going?
To your place -
to collect what you owe me.
You'll find I'm not at home.
I can't pay you back today.
I am waiting for a girl.
But you may pawn my ring.
There she is.
Get lost.
And what if she returns to you -
and you no longer have the ring?
She won't come back...
She ran off with an American.
He had a Cadillac.
It's a shame about the children.
They were left with me
and there is no money for food...
They cry out from hunger -
in the night.
How old are they?
Fourteen, nine -
seven, six -
three, two, one -
and the youngest half a year.
So many.
We were young and in love...
It was spring.
You look strange...
What ails you?
I think I am in love.
With whom?
I don't know -
but she's sitting over there.
She's not bad looking.
Why not do something?
And what if she rejects me?
I could hardly endure that.
It is our custom in Albania
first to...
Sit here...
and I will go and speak
in your behalf.
I shall awaken in her heart
a passion -
for you...
I'll lie -
shamelessly.
Good evening.
You see him over there?
He is in love -
with you.
But so am I.
Excuse me...
Can I help you? - I fell asleep...
Where are you going? - Nowhere...
I am here,
but my girlfriend is not in.
I was to live with her.
It is no use waiting.
She was taken to prison,
for three years.
Now what I do?
I arrived today from Rouen
and I know no one here.
If you like...
I live in the next room.
Tell me -
are you a proper
French gentleman? - No.
I mean, yes, I am -
but not French.
Albanian.
That will have to do.
I am going now,
and taking the dog with me.
He is sometimes noisy at night,
from nightmares.
But why?
I can sleep on the couch.
It is too hard to serve as a bed.
And besides -
I am hot-blooded -
and you are very beautiful.
Then where will you go?
- To a friend's.
He lives quite nearby.
Sleep peacefully.
I'll be back in the morning.
I have gone to seek lodgings.
Thank you for your kindness. Mimi.
Where is your black coat?
Can't you see?
You have ruined it...
I am lost.
Newspaper czar Gassot
summons me.
He is founding a fashion magazine,
The Girdle of Iris -
and plans to make me
editor-in-chief.
If I appear in this get-up,
he'll change his mind.
You cannot accept his offer anyway.
Gassot -
is a supporter of the Right.
Your principles prevent you
eating bread -
bathed in the sweat of the people.
- You're mistaken.
He's in the left
of the parliamentary Right -
and voted for widows pensions.
Besides, he knows people
of influence from whom I can get -
commissions for your compositions
and Rodolfo's portraits.
That changes everything.
When do you meet him?
At five.
There is no time to lose.
The shoes can be polished black -
so no one will notice that one is
round-toed and the other pointed.
All I need is a black coat.
I would give ten years of my life
and my right hand for one.
Is Rodolfo the painter in?
- I am.
My cousin recommends
your reasonable portraits.
I am told they are good likenesses.
More precise than photographs.
He is talented. He even took
all the awards in school.
My son won an award, and he is
only seven. - A talented child.
This portrait you want, Monsieur...
- Blancheron, of Nantes -
manufacturer of sugar.
I have also written books
on the subject.
The picture could be of...
middle size.
Like that on... Who is it?
My mother.
How much would one of that size
cost? - From 1,000 to 1,200 francs.
Depending on whether the hands show.
- My cousin said five hundred.
It depends on the season.
Paint prices vary with the by season.
How very interesting...
just like sugar. - Precisely.
Make one for 1,000 francs.
- That is a mistake...
For 200 more, he will paint your
hands, holding your book on sugar.
It is essential.
- Would that look good?
Exceptionally good.
Is the painting to go in your home?
Yes, in the living room.
Then you must be painted
in your smoking jacket.
Please sit in this chair -
and take off your coat.
I have no smoking jacket with me.
Not to worry,
my friend will lend you his.
Marcel, please hang up
the gentleman's coat.
How unfortunate
that I will be late for supper.
The restaurant downstairs
will bring us whatever we want.
I'll go see to the order.
I have several ideas -
for the improvement of the
contents of The Girdle of Iris.
For instance, one could,
perhaps, I'd suggest...
Publish a play, for example,
and along with the play -
the characters
dressed in a certain way -
and to present that as the fashion,
the latest fashion, of course.
And one also could envisage -
something else. Like, for example,
how should I say it -
a serial novel,
the works of Baudelaire.
When may I fetch it?
I will complete it tomorrow
and bring it to you.
I would prefer to pay at once
rather than remain in debt to you.
We are alike in that respect.
My cash is at the hotel.
You'll have it tomorrow.
If you would get me my coat...
It was very dusty,
so I had it laundered.
They charged only forty francs.
- You may put it on my account.
I'm paying nothing.
Merde!
The swine!
He wanted money -
for a few kilometres.
There must be 60,000 francs there.
15,240 francs, to be precise.
Advance payment for editing a
sample Issue of The Girdle of Iris.
Here is my plan.
Secure from life's material woes -
I intend to do some serious work.
First I will get rid of these rags -
and dress decently, so the
fashion salons will respect me.
If you'll follow my example -
I can put you to work as
advertising agents.
Until then let a strict economy
govern our lives.
I accept wholeheartedly.
But to start with give me -
a couple of thousand francs.
- Why?
To find advertisers
I must have a car -
with which -
to seek them out in the provinces.
This is true.
Shall we order a table?
Yes, then I can tell you more
about my new job.
There's an excellent restaurant
a short way from here.
It is rather expensive, -
but we can make up the difference
in time saved.
But from tomorrow on -
we shall attempt to devise
yet further means of economizing.
Instead of eating out,
we shall hire a female cook.
It would be wiser to procure
a manservant -
who could double as cook.
Our household
would always be in order -
and we would have more time to work,
with him to shine our shoes -
and see to our urgent affairs.
Then we will need
larger accommodations.
That, in any case, is unavoidable -
that we may live in keeping
with our new position.
I'll be back.
A pack of Celtiques, please.
Good evening, Mimi.
You found a job...
As you can see.
And a place to live?
With the job.
Are you going to the nightclub?
No.
Just escorting my friends.
I don't care for modern music.
I might have a drink though.
A glass of water, please.
Merde!
Who was that? - A regular.
He behaves like a peasant.
It's kind of you to see me home -
but this is nowhere near
where I live.
Would that you lived in Moscow -
that I might have your company
that much longer.
That's a little too far.
We could take the boulevard.
Fancy that...
We have arrived by chance
where I live.
Wouldn't you like to come up
and meet my dog?
Very well, but just for a moment.
I'll make some coffee.
In the meanwhile, you may view
the city from my picture window.
They are dead.
Had I known that, I'd have
bought some made of plastic.
What's its name? - Baudelaire.
I'm out of coffee -
but I'll make some soup.
May I kiss your hand?
You are fast...
The sooner
to reach the goal.
How much is this?
One hundred francs.
Fifty.
All right, fifty, for you.
Do you want this?
I live with two other girls.
They have a mutual male friend
they're constantly fighting over.
I don't understand them...
The man is stupid, ugly -
and married besides.
Uglier than I am?
- There's no comparison...
Next to him, you're a Lino Ventura.
- Who's he?
An Italian movie star.
You don't know him? - No.
Forget him.
Let's talk about me...
Why not -
move in with me?
I'm against marriage in principle -
but we could make an exception.
You stop working,
we can live off my paintings.
What would I do then?
Walk Baudelaire -
clean, that sort of thing...
Are you serious? - No...
I'll clean and you can
look out the window at the park.
In the evenings
we'll go to the opera.
My wallet has been stolen.
Do you have any money?
Just a few francs.
Your passport!
Listen, how much was the check?
Four hundred and twenty.
Will you permit me to pay it?
You figure on getting your money
from that bum?
It makes no difference.
Then as far as we are concerned,
the matter is settled.
I have to go now...
My shift begins at nine.
I have to wait for my passport.
I'll be at your place
tomorrow evening.
I'll be waiting.
Come with me.
Why?
Your papers are not in order.
You've resided in France
for three years without a visa, -
a residence or work permit.
You claim to have come by rail
from Spain.
But you choose not to talk.
There's nothing else to tell.
You will spend the night here.
We will decide your fate
in the morning.
Can I make a call? My dog
is home alone. - In the morning.
You are to be immediately
deported to Albania.
The flight leaves in two hours.
If you are found
within France's borders -
without the required papers -
it will mean
a six-month jail sentence.
Can I call now?
Make it fast.
Mimi hasn't arrived yet.
I don't know.
Try again in a couple of hours.
There was a call for you just now.
Who? - Didn't say.
Set out a coffee for me.
Listen -
I'm being deported.
Will you look after Baudelaire
and my paintings?
I won't be coming back.
I'll wind up in jail -
if I do. You understand?
Good-bye, Rodolfo.
A Suze.
- Problems?
No. Thirst.
What do you think?
1,800 francs.
Only thirty thousand on the meter.
It has brakes and all.
Great.
Are you free this evening?
What's bothering you?
You don't seem enthusiastic.
Rodolfo's been deported.
No papers.
Merde.
- I'll get Baudelaire.
Let's meet there tonight and
haul the paintings to your place.
Right.
Looking for Rodolfo?
Yes, I am. We were supposed
to meet... Where is he?
He's been deported.
He was in the country illegally.
When? - This afternoon.
Is he... is he coming back?
I don't know.
I must go.
Shut the door when you leave.
SPRING
Hello, Musette. How's it going?
What does it look like?
How many today? The magazine
must go to press by Friday.
Just one,
but a full page. From Printemps.
I know.
They called and cancelled it.
Coffee originated in Arabia,
where it was discovered by a goat.
Balzac drank
seventy cups of it a day.
What do you need the ladder for?
It is the link between
me and my love.
Have you read Shakespeare?
Of course.
He was a great philosopher.
Do you remember
"Romeo and Juliet"?
Do I ever...
"It was the nightingale
and not the lark...
That pierced the fearful hollow
of thine ear..."
Do you not understand?
I've met the daughter
of a good family -
but for some reason
her father cannot stand me.
The girl's name is Juliet
and her room has a balcony.
I came to borrow the bird -
to wake me in the morning
before the old man rises.
I would be obliged -
if from now on
you would call me Romeo Montague.
How do you like my plan?
Girdle of Iris, hello.
It's for you, Marcel, from abroad.
Right...
Where?
What time?
Forget about Juliet,
we've got to go. - Where?
To the border.
I'll explain on the way.
Let me have a few hundred.
- There isn't any.
Where has it all gone?
To the printer,
to ransom the magazine.
You could have let them keep it.
We need a photo for the cover.
Hold still.
There he is...
Let's get going
so we can make Paris morning.
When is Mimi in? - Mimi?
She's not here any more. But they
stop by almost every evening.
They who? - Mimi and Francis,
her boyfriend. Why do you ask?
I'm an old friend.
Someone's been asking for you.
- Who?
Some old friend.
He's sitting over there.
I believe that "The Crossing
of the Red Sea" is finished.
I feel empty.
If you get it sold,
we can pay the rent.
Perhaps you could
come down on the price. - No.
I will not sell it for less than -
two hundred francs.
I've already put over ten thousand
francs' worth of paint into it.
What if the landlord
calls the police?
You still don't have
a residence permit.
Come in.
What a surprise...
...offer our guest a glass of water.
To what do I owe this honor?
I was so inspired by your portrait -
that I have decided
to become a collector.
I am now in need of
a relatively large painting -
and you immediately sprang to mind.
You are in luck.
I have just completed this -
and intend to
send it off in the morning -
with some other works
to an exhibition in New York.
But, if you would care to make
an offer... As an old customer...
The work pleases me greatly.
I'll pay a thousand francs for it.
You're joking.
- 1,200.
2,000. - 1,400.
1, 700. - 1,500...
and two opera tickets
for this evening.
Opera is a dying art form,
but all right.
Go and pay the rent
and then get dressed.
You can go to the opera
with Musette.
I'll wait outside.
I have to talk to Marcel.
The poor girls -
they are not
made for a life like this.
Being men, and therefore stronger
in every respect -
we make child's play
of all misfortune.
Nor do we become depressed -
if our clothing isn't always neat.
But it's different for the women.
Even the slightest garment
brings them joy, -
nor should this be denied them.
Secondly -
art and literature have been
in great demand of late -
and -
we are at present earning
nearly as much as porters.
This is true.
Works of art
are selling like pancakes.
So it is agreed.
Tomorrow we take the girls shopping,
indulging their female whims.
Sunday we will have a picnic
in the countryside.
And what about me?
You have two days
to find yourself a companion.
Who's to blame if your appearance
sparks no female interest?
If you are unsuccessful,
you may come along -
as our chauffeur.
Monsieur, there's a call for you -
in the kitchen.
Madame -
your eyes are like two full moons.
I hope their purchases
will not exceed 600 francs.
And never come back.
They didn't like it?
The louts...
They are trying to crush me -
to get me to break up my brushes -
to jump out of the window.
Let's go and borrow some money
from Marcel -
and then go out to eat.
I gave you -
a cash advance.
I want it back in two days exactly.
Not three, not five, but two days.
Good luck.
Good-bye.
What is this all about?
He's mad that I serialized my play.
He claims it didn't fit -
the magazine's line. That readers
complained. What readers?
Besides, as editor-in-chief,
I exemplified policy.
He was merely the publisher.
Capitalist.
I'm hungry.
- So am I.
Come and eat at my place.
I happen to have some funds.
While we're at it -
I can perform
my latest composition for you.
I'm going to leave Marcel.
When?
This evening.
I'm already packed.
Does he know?
I haven't been able to tell him.
I'm going back to Strasbourg.
There's this man there, a farmer -
not very pretty, but -
sweet and dependable.
Why?
He doesn't need me.
All he loves is his books.
I pawned my ring yesterday
to get the rent.
I left the money on the table.
When I came back he'd taken it -
and spent it all
on first-edition Balzacs.
Poor Marcel.
He'll forget me in a week.
Or in any case faster
than I'll forget him.
Men are like that.
See me to the station?
- Of course.
I'll miss you.
Come and visit.
I'll send you the fare.
The man is wealthy.
You can count on it.
Write to me care of poste restante.
Why there?
I don't know.
How's it going, Mimi? - Fine.
Can I give you a ride?
Home.
You may.
Yes, darling.
I've found a place to work.
You don't need to...
I can't go on living like this,
never having any money.
I can't breathe,
as if I were suffocating.
I'll open the window.
That won't help...
Besides, it's already cold in here.
Shall I light a fire in the stove?
There's no wood or coal.
Some old poems of mine...
I thought I'd publish a collection -
someday.
Al least they'll -
provide some heat.
I'm going for a little walk.
Don't be long.
Good evening, Rodolfo.
- Good evening, Mimi.
I love you, you know that -
but life is difficult.
Yes -
I understand.
AUTUMN
What?
Nothing.
It's great, isn't it?
The voice of the people -
is the voice of God.
That -
is known as turkey
stuffed with truffles.
What about that leg of lamb?
What color!
Lamb is the favorite food
of the gods -
and also my godmother's,
Madame Chandelier.
And what about those trouts?
They are superb swimmers.
They climb rapids as easily -
as we would accept
a dinner invitation this evening.
Those fruit are known
as pineapples.
I nearly ate one once.
Speaking of fruits, I wouldn't
say no to that pheasant there.
Why this profusion of viands?
You do not know?
Today is All Saints' Day.
The great family feast.
Care to spend the evening with me?
No money.
How much have you got?
I don't understand.
I've lost my appetite.
The same here.
I can see -
the phantom of the past
sits at this table.
But if you intend
to waste away to nothing -
you may as well do it
on a full stomach.
Am I disturbing you?
Come in.
I'm so cold.
I happened to be passing by -
and saw the light in the window...
I lost my apartment a week ago -
and I've been wandering
the streets ever since.
I'm an artists' model these days -
but it doesn't pay very well.
I only show my head and hands.
I've been promised
some wages tomorrow.
Then I'll move back
to my apartment.
Where are you going?
- To get some tobacco.
In Havana...
We'll be back tomorrow sure as
arrows loosed from a steady hand.
Where have you been?
Don't ask me anything!
Just let me sit here by your side.
It's so warm here.
I'll stay with you until tomorrow.
Do you want me to?
It's going to be very cold here.
That's good -
then it will be like it was.
I'll clear the table.
The warmth has made me dizzy.
I can't stand up.
You have fever.
I'll help you to bed.
I'm going to get a doctor
with Schaunard.
You stay here
and keep Mimi company.
I've been awake all the time.
Rodolfo still loves me.
And you?
I've never stopped loving him.
Then all is well.
No -
I'm going away. Forever.
What do you mean?
I'm going to die soon.
Look...
Do you believe me now?
If I'd stayed quietly here -
with Rodolfo -
everything would be fine now.
Poor Rodolfo...
I'm ending up a burden to him
once again -
but not for long...
The last dress he buys for me
will be white.
Don't say that. You'll get better.
Rodolfo has gone for a doctor.
It took me an hour
to climb the stairs yesterday.
Had there been another woman here -
I would have jumped
out of the window.
Rodolfo knows everything...
She must go to the hospital.
I'll call an ambulance.
I have a car.
You must be brave.
I can relieve the pain,
but I can't save her.
She will live -
until spring at the latest.
I can keep her
in the private room but -
I must inform you -
although it may seem cruel,
that it is very expensive.
I'll get the money.
Who painted this, Becker?
Open the curtains.
Spring is here -
and I want to look out.
It's so grey indoors.
Why don't you go
and pick me some flowers?
She is dead.
Shall we come with you?
No -
I need to be alone.
