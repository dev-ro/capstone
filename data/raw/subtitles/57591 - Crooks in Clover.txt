It's not
the first time!
I know.
You are going to Paris.
But the timing sucks.
There is
a blanket..
..and Germaine
added some tea.
Why not a balaclava
since you're at it ?
You would think
I'm leaving for Tibet !
Good bye,
Mr. Naudin.
Good bye, Gustave.
Mr Fernand, ..
.. the fair will be at its
busiest on Sunday.
If you were here...
I told you I'd be gone for 48 h !
You don't need me to
line up 10 tractors !
What ?
Make sure it does not break down !
What does not break down ?
The tow-truck.
Oh ! Mr Fernand.
(Fernand)
"Louis has returned.
Your presence indispensible."
Presence indispensible.
After 15 years of silence,
that's a bit much.
15 years of banishment.
For him to return to Paris, ..
..Something severe must have
happened to him !
He must be in some
serious trouble!
You're making us wait !
The road, not too bad ?
Just enough !
It's nice to see
you again.
The Mexican was
getting impatient.
It's not a joke ?
I would not have dared.
Still, it's a surprise.
It's not the end of
of your surprises. Come !
It's Fernand.
Mr Fernand is here.
Let him in, Let him in.
Not a minute too soon.
I thought you'd never arrive
or arrive too late.
You know, 900 km is not an
afternoon stroll !
Pleasure to see you again,
old bandit.
Same here.
I was afraid to die amidst
the monkeys..
..without seeing a
friendly face again.
Ah !
It's mostly your face I was
thinking about.
I've been meaning to
go visit you.
You do not always get to do
what you want.
And you ?
I didn't know the government
brought you back.
Why did you come back?
Thanks, doc,
thanks for everything.
Henri, ..
..ask them to come up.
Don't you think
it's better...
Don't interrupt !
Otherwise..
..we will run out of time.
Henri !
Give the doctor 10,000 FF.
What is it, Louis ?
I came back to die here.
To be buried in the Pantin
cemetery, with my parents.
The Americas, it's good
to make some doe.
You can even live there,...
..but when it comes to leaving
your bones behind, ..
... there's only France.
I'm dying and I leave a
daughter behind.
Patricia.
You must take care of her.
That's a good one!
You knew her mother.
Sweet-lips Suzanne!
I'd say you're more the one
who knew her.
For the money, I'm leaving
you more than enough.
My businesses run smoothly.
My attorney will fill you in.
It's like roulette
For trouble, ..
..36 times your wager !
No, listen, Louis.
Your kid, your businesses,
it's all very nice.
But me too, I have my own businesses.
And they are legal ones.
It's only when all is well
that friends are there for you.
I did not say that !
No, no, you didn't say that,
you didn't say that, ..
..but you would abandon
Patricia to the vultures.
Oh ! Oh ! My little angel...
Your little angel !
Your little angel !
You're into honest business,
you would not know.
There are evil men !
The world is full of them.
They will rob her blind.
They will pluck her,
they will take everything.
I got her raised in a Convent School.
English lessons, you know, the works.
She will finish on the street
and it will be my fault.
It will be your fault !
Stop it !
I've known you for 20 years.
I've seen your circus a 100 times !
About everything, cigarettes,
drugs, women!
Whining's your specialty !
I saw you cry! Don't give me that crap !
Yes !
Don't you understand
she's losing her father ?
That I'm about to die?
You're capable of it !
10 years you left. Here you are.
I drop everything to come and see you.
Me, like an idiot...
Come in!
Listen Théo, you
could have come up alone.
If her presence is
giving you grief...
Yes, in my house, ..
..men talk,
women beat it.
I wait for you downstairs.
See you soon.
Alright... I will be brief.
I have just handed over the
business to Fernand.
He will be my
successor.
You should have
spoken to me about it.
I could have organised
elections,
But I prefer to do it
this way !
Objections anybody ?
Because, me, I got
nothing left to say.
Hum...
I think everything
is in order... no ?
Pascal !
Pascal !
Oh ! Louis !
Louis, Louis,
fuck !
Louis... Pascal !
I won't hold you
back any longer.
Louis, don't fuck around !
I know what I'm talking about.
You want me...
to open the window for you ?
Shit !
You see...
It's daylight already.
Yes, and from here...
all you can see is the sky.
I don't give a damn about the sky !
I'll be there shortly.
What I'm interested in...
is the street.
Yes, they threw me straight..
..from the plane into the ambulance.
I... I could see nothing.
Tell me, it must have...
it must have changed a lot ?
I don't know, not that much.
Tell me anyway.
It's one of these mornings
the way you like them ..
..the way we liked them !
Ah ! The girls are leaving the Lido,
just like old times.
You remember, it's at this..
..hour we used to score with them.
If I had been told this guy
would die in his bed...
China, 4th Century BC
You're born. You live.
You die.
Like everybody else.
Not necessarily.
I mean :
You don't necessarily die in bed.
I'm exhausted.
Got anything to munch on?
Sure.
Yours ?
Help yourself.
20 years ago,
His odds would have been 100 to one, ..
..killed by surprise.
But what saved him,
is his psychology.
Not everybody is that gifted
There's only one psychology:
Shoot first.
Rather simple, but efficient.
The Mexican, he was top class
In a 100 years, they'll still
talk about him.
But lately he did not
have all his faculties
It's true, towards the end,
He was affabulating.
He was like a child,
he had whims...
Thanks, Henri.
You spoke to him last.
Did you notice ?
Notice what ?
Did you take this handing
over story seriously ?
I shouldn't have ?
Then, I was wrong.
There you go !
Raoul, there was no need
to get upset.
The man agrees.
Some would take advantage
of the situation, ..
..but we're not like that.
What can we do for
you in return?
Beat it.
I promised to look
after the business.
I told you I was wrong !
But wrong or not,
I'm the boss.
There you have it.
Pascal !
Yes.
Listen... We don't know you.
You are asking for
sleepless nights, ..
..migraines, ..
nervous breakdowns
I'm as strong as an ox.
I've been living in the
countryside for 15 years.
I go to bed early,
wake up at the crack of dawn.
There s trouble at Tomate's.
Some croupiers fear for
the cash register.
Does that happen often?
Never.
That can be dealt with amicably.
If you want to get back
to your countryside, go have a look.
It's on your way.
Oh ! The Volfonis !
Don't worry.
The toad's venom..
.. does not prevent the
caravan from moving on.
Ciao !
Shall we go together ?
I don't know if
you will like it.
I'll let you know.
Is he a fake mafia boss
or a real retard?
For me, it's nothing at all.
A simple phone call,
and 10 mn later, ..
..he doesn't exist anymore.
They look like 2 idiots, ..
..but I would not get overconfident,
they are specialists.
The Volfonis know the drill.
Where there were chips to be had,
they were holding the rake.
How about the other ?
The vain one?
Our friend Fritz?
The clandestine distillery.
Amusing how people change.
Before, the Mexican would never
recruit any queers.
Must be age. Towards the end of his life , ..
..he was reclassifying..
If it's for charity, ..
..that's something else.
- This is Tomate's place.
I was expecting something
more grand.
According to Tomate, ..
..the gambler loves the gaming table.
What's around it, he doesn't care.
Doesn't even see it.
Take cover.
Under the trees, they could have.
There are no more specialists
of infantry combat.
The spirit of the foot soldier is dead.
That's too bad.
Who's behind it ? The Volfonis ?
Looks like their dirty methods.
Monsieur Fernand !
I am of the opinion
to play it cool.
In case we're still expected.
But..without ordering you around, ..
..you could stay a bit behind.
During the Russian retreat, ..
.. the ones staying behind all
got killed.
Are you responsible for this raucus ?
I apologize.
M. Fernand, the new boss.
I was not aware.
Now you are.
I am Tomate,
the manager of this joint.
Hello !
Nice to meet you.
What's all this shooting?
Surely, nobody would dare
shoot at you?
Well, somebody dared.
Tomate !
Yes.
Send Freddy around the back.
There's a car with 2 guys in it.
Needs cleaning.
Where are the others ?
What others ?
The ones who were making trouble.
Trouble ? Here ?
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
You did not call?
The night has been normal.
What's this mess all about ?
Henri's number ?
Balzac 44-05.
Henri cannot explain.
3 sudden deaths
in less than half an hour.
The succession is starting
rather abruptly...
The Mexicain bought it..
..under instalment plan,
from a retired prosecutor.
After 3 months,
a stupid accident !
A steal !
Welcome, Sir,
my name is John.
Please.
He died..
..2 hours ago.
We should have been here earlier,
we were delayed.
Some sort of disputes.
And then...
Henri got killed.
The Volfonis ?
Ah !
When the lion dies, ..
..the jackals fight over the empire.
Let's not ask more from the Volfonis
than from the sons of Charlemagne.
Ah !
Maître Folace. Notary public.
Hello.
Nice to meet you.
I wish it were in happier circumstances.
Your room is ready.
The Mexican called ahead.
You are too kind, thank you.
Would be good if everything can
be settled within a day.
Were you a longtime friend
of Louis ?
Forever.
Mademoiselle will be sad.
Taboo subject.
No faux-pas !
The deceased requested it.
As far as Patricia is concerned,
her dad's in perfect health..
..on the Mexican plains..
..where the postal service is scarce,
hence his silence.
I must be leaving.
Maître Folace knows where
to join me.
I'm living with my mother.
Thank you.
Pleased to see you.
Because I cannot handle the
young one anymore.
I've known her for
a long time.
I held her over the
baptismal font.
A lovely ceremony.
She was already
beautiful.
How about taking Mr Naudin's
luggage up.
- Yes, Sir !
I'd like us to deal with
the serious stuff.
We're not gonna worry about
a kid's fancies!
Me, I don't care.
It's your problem now.
What do you mean ?
You accepted to
take care of her ?
Yup.
You will experience
all that I did before !
The visits to the
school principal.
The notes to the teachers,
the expulsions.
Mlle Patricia
was expelled?
From everywhere, my dear friend.
Mademoiselle never lasted more
than 6 months.
Just enough time...
to overstay her welcome.
I am glad that you are here !
Not for long, cos it's gonna
change quickly !
She will have to study !
Otherwise I send her
to the trainers.
Off to boarding school
waking up to the bugle.
No kidding !
She has to be told !
I'm going. Where is she ?
She is sleeping.
Her party lasted
until 3 AM.
Sir!
He says that your
room is ready.
Ok !
Your Brit
does not drink ?
You don't say ! And he's
no more british than us.
The Mexican recruited him.
Found him where?
Here.
In front of his safe.
17 years ago.
Jean had broken through
the Louis XV cupboard.
The Mexican surprised him.
He was attacking the safe
with a blowtorch.
I can imagine.
He could not hand him over
to the police, ..
..nor pay the damages himself.
Jean stayed 3 months as a
majordome to pay for it.
He then discovered a vocation,
some style too.
And wisdom.
Free food and lodging, 2 suits a year.
He was spending his life in prison.
He chose freedom !
Funny, I pictured you
taller, more tanned.
But that's ok.
Are you really
uncle Fernand?
Euh... yes.
We can kiss.
That's customary.
Well, if that's customary,
then !
Lucky I just shaved.
Dad annouced your arrival.
When ?
In his last letter,
a month ago.
Does that surprise you ?
Euh, no. Oh ! No.
There were 3 pages about you.
Your adventures...
All that you did for him.
Heu... Tell me...
I'd like a cup of tea, ..
..bread, butter and eggs...
You take care of this ?
Tea at 7 PM!
Well, ..
..My timing is slightly off.
Is that so !
Oh ! By the way, ..
..It must have been something
when you dragged him out of the river.
Whom ?
Well... dad !
He told me in his letter :
"Fernand got me from under the water."
He forgot to tell me which river.
Be kind, I'm famished.
Go take care of my little snack.
You don't answer ?
How do you want me
to remember ?
Over there, there's nothing but
rivers, everywhere !
Full of crocodiles.
Are you happy now?
Let me finish washing up !
Then we'll talk.
We need to have a talk.
Yes, uncle.
Serious matters.
Yes, uncle.
Can I call you uncle?
Did you kill many?
Crocodiles.
Over there, there's nothing but crocs, ..
..everywhere !
I'm gonna go take care of your tea.
Since firmness seems to
do you good, ..
.. You ll do well.
Money !
Money that's not coming in.
For 2 months, ..
..the Volfonis have not been paying.
Tomate is more than a
month late and Théo...
Is that a revolt ?
No, Sire. A revolution.
Nobody pays.
They're gonna pocket
my niece's money ?
Looks like it.
Did the Mexican know?
No, no, certainly not.
He was a man to shoot
indiscriminately.
And with the press, ..
..had the daughter got wind
of it, you can imagine.
Yes, and if we have to do
some killing ..
.. I ll take care of it.
A tutor, it's not the same.
It gets guillotined just like a dad.
Who's asking you to intervene ?
We have Pascal.
Shall I ask him over ?
If I did not have to be back in
Avignon in 2 days, I'd say no.
But I'm in a hurry.
It's not good to let debts
go uncollected..
..and allow staff to dream.
Dream?
Do you dream in colours ?
Antoine Delafoy,
the oldest and most loyal..
..friend of Patricia's.
I know you and admire you.
Ah !
Patricia talks about you often.
You are the gaucho,
the legendary uncle.
She never spoke of you.
Ah !
I will sing my own merits.
It's sometimes quite edifying.
I lay claim to some one-liners..
..by Alphonse Allais..
..and to adventures
of famous men. Ah !
Ah ! Ah !
Is he always like that ?
No, it's his irritating side.
He must talk.
Truth be told, he's shy.
You will love him
when you know him better.
Because he's lovable?
I don't seduce, I captivate.
Never mind, John. l'll do it.
Thank you.
About the dreams in colour.
Borowsky attributes them to
the phosphorus contained in fish.
I prefer Freud.
It's more fun.
What do you think ?
Nothing.
I do not dream in colours !
I do not have time to dream !
No water, that would be a crime.
It's 10 years of age.
Uncle's businesses..
..keep him very busy.
Are you coming with us
tomorrow night ?
Where to ?
He's asking where. How funny !
Frankie Mills plays at Pleyel
concert hall..
..Corelli, Chopin.
That's old school.
With Mills, it can become
ferocious ! Tiger-like !
Everybody will be there.
Ok.
We are taking the provincial
uncle to the circus.
Thank you for the thought.
But you will go without me.
Tomorrow, I'll be in Montauban.
And Miss Patricia will
be studying.
Ok, Patricia ?
Yes, uncle.
You are right.
We must not rush her.
What's happening this time?
Our friend will explain.
The Volfonis have organised
a little get-together, ..
.. "meeting"-style,
if you see what I mean.
They're talking behind your back.
Where did you hear that from?
I cannot tell. I promised.
It would be bad.
So ?
Well...
2 solutions.
Either we make the trip,
or we ignore them.
Yes, of course.
A round of inspection
cannot be harmful.
Well,
We're gonna join them !
Mr Fernand.
Is there a space for me ?
If the meeting becomes unruly,
I have a calming presence.
Foie gras first or last ?
I'd rather have it tomorrow.
I'm going out.
Board meeting.
What ?
You are not dining with us ?
Jean will bring Champagne.
Thanks for the invite.
Bon appétit.
It's bull.
No, it comes from Strasbourg.
It's expensive.
I mean the board meeting !
If you ask me, the uncle from the pampa
is out womanizing.
You think so ?
We walked the streets
for the Mexican.
I don't sell myself for his ghost.
Walking the streets, selling yourself.
Looks like you're looking for
words that hurt.
They're just images.
Images, that amused me
when I was young !
Louis was not
very social-minded.
He had a right-wing spirit.
Stop it !
You would ask for a raise,
he would whip his gun out.
But he brought security.
Living off crumbs,
is that security ?
How much did he cost us in 15 years?
Do you know how much ?
Tell them, Paul - I can't bring myself to.
At 5,000 per month of rental,...
That's 60,000 a year,
900,000 in 15 years !
And 300,000 per year
of expenses !
How much is that altogether ?
5 millions !
You, same for the farm !
Tell me it's not true.
I didn't say anything.
I won't give anything away.
I invite you to do it.
You invite,
you invite...
That's all very nice,
but invitations...
What's bothering you ?
The climate.
3 dead since yesterday.
If it's like Stalingrad.
Once is enough.
I'd rather keep my
distances.
Am I the scapegoat?
Say so straight away.
"Mr Raoul,
you killed Henri.
"And the others.
"And the Mexican
and the Archduke of Austria !"
Hey, Léon,
it's me, Pascal !
I'm coming, who's with you ?
The notary.
You say that, but there are
3 of you.
I announce the assistants,
not the boss.
I'm expecting orders from Raoul.
Les marins ont besoin
de faire des phrases.
Allons !
If you go along, I guarantee
Fernand won't sue.
Leave it.
Good evening, Gentlemen...
Madame.
I don't think I invited you.
You didn't have to,
this is my place.
What are you organising ?
A synod ?
May I ?
I gathered them to decide
what we do for the Mexican.
about the funeral.
If you re talking about the
Mexican's funeral, ..
.. that's my business.
Henri's funerals, ..
..these you can take care of.
Not again, I'm not assuming
responsibility for the massacre.
We'll talk about this later.
We have other problems to deal with.
Business first.
Let's begin at the beginning.
Ladies first.
Mme Mado,
I presume...
Yes.
Dear Madame, Maître Folace
has indicated certain..
..problems
in your management.
temporary,
I'm sure...
Kindly explain yourself.
Monsieur, there are
2 explanations:
recession, and
lack of personnel.
The customer does not ignore us,
he is distracted.
The furtive one, for instance,
is completely extinct !
Furtive ?
The neighbourhood client who would
pop by, : "Hello , goodbye !"
Instead of coming after dinner,
He stays in front of his TV..
..to see whether he's a
modern man.
And the Sunday lover !
Also extinct. Why ?
TV again ?
The car, Monsieur Fernand !
The car !
Ah !
But tell me, you were talking
about a shortage of personnel.
That's a disaster.
A good resident girl is rare.
Girls export themselves these days.
The African mirage is harmful.
One day, they'll swim all
the way to Timbuctu !
Alright, Thank you.
We shall talk about this again.
The apple juice guy ?
You must be talking about me?
In your activity,
business is not very good.
People still drink pastis,
true of false ?
Less than before...
French youth drinks
sparkling water..
..and the veterans drink
mineral waters.
And above all, ..
..there's whisky.
And your point is ?
Whisky is an absolute drama
We put 2 chemists on it...
I don't know this one,
Is it a new model?
Latest from Beretta.
For close combat.
To fire through your pocket..
..in the train.
But you must have the use for it !
Otherwise it's a waste of money.
You'll forget the price,
quality remains.
Unorthodox weapon.
Where did you get it from ?
From Uncle Antonio.
Berthe's brother ?
Yes.
- All this to say..
..pastis is losing
market share, ..
..The customer becomes
difficult to follow.
Everywhere's the same, me,
if I were to talk about tractors...
Yes, well...
Still warm?
Thanks.
Good! Now our turn !
Gambling has never been so hot.
That's your opinion.
Accounting is more where the
problem lies.
You are men of action.
I have fixed that.
Fixed !
What if we disagree?
Impossible.
I have adopted the simplest system.
Take a look.
We carry forward
last year's figures.
Stop !
Last year was a record year.
But you'll equal it this year.
You all seem to be in great shape,
happy, dynamic.
He's poking fun.
I can't believe it.
Pascal !
Yes,
M. Fernand.
Organise collection
within a week.
And if we don't pay,
you have us shot!
Eh, Monsieur Raoul !
Well !
All that's left is for me to
thank you for your attention.
Madame.
Bastien,
Kindly see the gentlemen out.
You, Raoul Volfoni,
I must say you're a real one.
A real what ?
A real leader.
He doesn't know Raoul !
He's gonna get a painful awakening.
I've been diplomatic
cos you were around.
But that's over !
I'm gonna work on him ferociously !
He'll eat in my hand !
He'll apologize !
He'll stand at attention !
I had forgotten..
.. ten percent penalty
for late payment.
He dared hit me.
He does not realize.
Good evening.
This little party has
made me feel 20 years younger
M. Naudin kinda roughed up
M. Volfoni senior.
Congratulations, sir.
What is that ?
Oh !
The flute was gonna answer the
string section !
Uncle, that's just not done.
Please !
What is it, uncle?
Have you been annoyed ?
A bit.
Mr Delafoy,
I'd like an explanation.
Wear your shoes !
What must I explain ?
All this: romantic lighting,
soft music.
On the Louis XVI armchair...
The confusion is understandable.
The words are inadequate.
It's not Louis XVI ?
Louis XV. You were not far off.
And Corelli does not do
soft music.
For me, it is !
And this is my home.
I like this, the theory is daring
and very defensible.
Let's discuss music
according to the location, ..
.. the elixir and the flask,
content and container.
Patricia, my darling.
I would not like to appear
old, or rude.
The Man of the pampa is
rough but courteous.
But I must tell you.
Your Antoine
drives me crazy.
Let's talk about me over dinner.
Go to your room.
Good night, Antoine !
As for you, young man...
I know the way.
Try to forget it!
Uncle Fernand !
Mr Fernand ! Come on !
Manners will improve,
at the expense of affection.
Yes, we will like each other less.
You disappoint me !
You were not very kind.
Your father would have acted
the same way.
He does not like delinquents.
Antoine, a delinquent?
He's a composer, a genius !
A genius does not walk
around barefoot.
What about Sagan ?
Good evening.
- Have you lost your mind ?
You're nuts !
In the middle of the night,
through the garden?
We did not want to wake up the
whole house.
Mademoiselle could get worried.
At that age, one can imagine.
We needed to talk to you.
I've seen you before.
At the Volfoni's.
I was on the other side.
Sit down, I'm eating.
- Now, ..
.. I'm really confused.
If two of us came,
there's a reason.
Bastien is the son of
my father's sister.
Like a direct cousin,
so to speak.
You understand..
..the complication ?
No, not yet.
Ah ! Of course !
You did not give
my references.
1st hired gun
for Volfoni !
5 years of work,
day and night..
..never a hiccup.
Can you see the problem ?
Ordinary people would
call this a dilemma.
We say :
a matter of honour.
Between you and the Volfonis, ..
..there's gonna be some bad weather.
If it turns into a thunderstorm, ..
..Bastien and I,
we'll be face to face, ..
.. with a gun in our hand.
Honesty commands to fire.
We could decimate our family!
I see.
Drink ?
Never between meals.
That's the rule.
Health, sobriety.
Alcohool ruins the shooting hand.
I do not blame you.
Family problems command respect.
What do you suggest ?
Bastien resigned from M. Raoul.
Your resignation follows, ..
..what ?
I cannot do less.
You must understand.
I understand.
Yes.
When protecting one's kid
creates a staff crisis, ..
..no need to understand, just pray.
"The old definition had
served for Racine
"Bossuet painted Dieu
the way he should be...
"..and Pascal painted him
the way he is."
Some composition...
What?
They only gave you 16/20!
That's a bit much!
I would have given you higher marks!
You are kind.
No, Patricia, my child.
Wednesday, when I arrived,..
..the ship was sinking.
Telephone for you.
A call from Montauban.
The caller is ...
..a tad rough.
The farmer type.
Allô, yes...
Yes, it's me.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
So ?
What ?
Yes.
Yes.
If I did not come back,
it's because I could not.
Well, I don't know !
One week, maybe two.
Just do the necessary !
Everytime I'm not around,
it's always the same !
Always problems.
Handle it on your own !
It's true !
"Pascal painted him
the way he is."
I would have given
Mademoiselle top marks.
Even with strict grading.
Thanks.
How much do we have ?
I don't know.
60,000.
Someone skimming off the top ?
It's even simpler.
The money that was supposed to
come in did not come in.
Her education, ..
..horse-riding, painting, music...
it's adding up to a huge budget.
Our expenses are taking
African proportions!
Allô, yes.
Yes.
Yes... He is here.
One second.
Who is it ?
Well, ..
..Raoul Volfoni.
Ah ! At last !
Allô.
So you finally understand,
you are paying - rite ?
You are obsessed !
I'm calling to warn
you about the distillery.
You must deal with it.
It's your role, chief !
None of your business .
You are unfair. We help you
and you're unhappy.
Raoul will fall into the trap ?
He will not resist the joy..
..of announcing bad news
to the other imbecile.
Surprising that the other brute
has not called yet.
The impulsive ones call.
Others make the trip.
There you have it !
Volfoni will be the scapegoat.
Are you happy now ?
Yes.
Here's one..
..who's almost out now !
Now, ..
..it's only a matter
of patience.
Within a month, the Volfonis..
..and the Mexican's businesses, ..
.. will be :
Théo, Tomate & Co.
Hide this.
The lipstick-stained cigarette butt
would tip off Neanderthal.
Yes, yes ! We're coming !
Come on !
Within 5 minutes...
You get away !
Get a move on !
It's you, Mr. Fernand?
You look surprised !
Raoul Volfoni is ridiculous.
I told him to send a driver ...
.. not to disturb you.
Now, I'm here !
By the way, your joint's not
easy to find.
Been driving around for one hour.
The police's been looking for 10 years.
They never found it !
That's why ..
..I shall miss this place.
Why do you say that ?
Disenchantment.
You never have the blues ?
Not much, no.
You don't have the same reasons.
You, you won the war !
Yes, but I'm not here tonight
for the parade !
So, what's happening ?
Well ..
.. here's what happening !
A full load ready to deliver !
Pastis worth 60,000.
A client, waiting for it
between 11 pm and midnight.
In Fontainebleau.
Well, we won't deliver.
Why ?
Our last driver just left
for the Sahara desert, ..
..In the oil business !
Because of the bonuses and
better insurance coverage.
Greed.
Freedom of spirit.
Replace him !
Mr Fernand, ..
.. Clandestine transport does not
just need qualifications, ..
..but also honesty.
Contrary to regular business.
We pay cash.
In banknotes.
This could tempt a simple mind.
Deliver it yourself, then !
I can't !
What do you mean ?
It's night-time, ..
..in the middle of the road,
an armed, ..
..uniformed man, yells "Stop !".
What do you do ?
I stop. I'm not gonna run him over !
That's why you still have
your driving licence.
I don't.
The papers are in order ?
All is in order.
But you don't mean...
For 60,000, I would mean
anything !
I've driven tractors.
And even a Patton tank !
Not my favourite brand.
Right.
Where do I deliver ?
Fontainebleau's big !
You know the pyramid ?
There will be a Cadillac stopped
at the Melun crossroads.
You...
He should have come through
by now !
I hope he did not run
into a roadblock .
That would be the pits !
He's not maintaining his
average, that's all.
With these arrogant guys, ..
..It's always the same.
Me, me, me !
When it comes to action,
nobody's there.
There he is.
He's gonna regret his Patton tank.
What are you waiting about ?
Whack him !
It's ok, let's go !
I'm ok, I'm ok, I'm ok !
Little brother, the world is
moving towards centralization.
And Tomate ?
If he must be fired,
he will be fired.
I only know one law,
the law of the jungle.
You're making this a habit !
Are you nuts ?
You're on a slippery slope.
You are getting further into debt !
30,000 for the truck
and 60 for the booze.
What are you talking about ?
Again !
Tonight, I don't feel
like chit-chatting.
Everything irritates me !
Ok, Ok.
You're a 50 pct partner rite?
Euh... of course.
Then, go open the door.
Dear boy, I think we are a tad late.
Are you a friend of Pat or Antoine ?
I'm wondering if he fucks her.
Who fucks whom ?
Antoine... Patricia.
Jean !
One second, Monsieur.
The family circle widens.
Again.
You drink too much.
Pour me another one.
Ok.
Where is Patricia ?
And Maître Folace ?
In the kitchen.
At least, he helps.
I'm hiding, it's unpleasant.
- Uncle Fernand !
There you are !
"Snacking by the fireplace" ?
Will you please explain !
Where are you coming from?
Friends' place.
Ex-paratroopers ?
Did you talk about old times ?
Did you play with
flame-throwers ?
Dry or with water?
Amazing how I feel at home right now!
You allowed me to invite
some of my friends.
They all come from very good families.
The one who offered you scotch.
His name is Jacques Letellier,
the son of the rear-Admiral.
You want me to do well in my exams?
Then, be logical.
A-levels without connections,
It's the cart without the horse.
The joint without the mortise.
A niece without uncle.
Nothing !
You never thought about this ?
Are you finished ?
Just between the 2 of us,
what are you thinking of?
Montauban. One should never leave it !
Lovely evening, isn't it ?
How much is that gonna cost ?
2,000 FF !
Some spend, some collect !
What do you think about this ? Hey ?
Some more anchovy sandwiches !
Here's the money you're owed..
.. plus penalties !
The Volfonis tried to
have me killed, Maître !
It's not their style.
Means they changed style.
When it changes, don't let
it bother you.
Would they dare come here ?
Idiots would dare anything.
That's how you can tell that they are..
Is that the right place ?
I never make mistakes !
Never !
Scotch ?
Nothing !
If they spend our doe,
there'll be trouble.
Excuse me, my good man ?
Monsieur?
Is your boss here ?
Who ?
M. Fernand Naudin.
Fernand, the pest !
The dishonest one !
That's his name !
Follow-me !
You bet !
Come on !
Would you please come in...
Hands on the table !
We have the firepower
of a dreadnaught !
Kindly leave these with me!
What ?
Children !
No more sandwiches !
Uncle, if your friends want to dance...
Move it, gentlemen !
Somebody could come in,
they could get ideas...
We barely avoided an incident.
What I should do, in principle,...
It's a bit soon isn't it ?
This step was not
necessary.
In the end, these days, ..
.. Men of action leave the stage
to the diplomats.
We live in the era of round tables
and 'détente'.
What do you think ?
I don't say no.
We're not here to
butter sandwiches !
Why not ?
Housework is not without a
certain distinction.
Especially when they lead...
..to fruitful negotiations.
Thanks.
Maître Folace, ..
.. kindly hide these grounds
for disagreement.
Oh !
Mr. Fernand !
I'm an experienced man.
Talking about manual labour, ..
.. what you were saying is an
excellent observation.
It remains an excellent foundation.
You're right.
If we did more odd jobs ourselves,
we'd get in less trouble.
Indeed.
- Jean !
Where's Jean ?
What do you need from her ?
No more ice !
No more scotch either !
Give her fruit juice..
Non, scotch ! Your fruit
juice, you can stick it...
Come on, Mademoiselle !
He said there's no more scotch.
Go buy some ! With this !
Hands off the cash, bitch !
Alcohol at such a young age !
It's a shame !
We, on the other hand,
are adults !
What say you we get ourselves
a drink ?
Well, the fact remains...
Maître Folace...
Yes ?
The run off the mill stuff..
..has been hijacked by the kids.
Shall we try the adventurous stuff ?
Won't make us feel any younger.
We're saved !
Saved !
Remains to be seen !
You've unearthed the sulphuric acid ?
Why do you say that ?
Hey !
It looks honest !
Without being outright dishonest, ..
..it does look strange.
It dates back to the times
of the Mexican.
The good old days !
We had to stop production.
Clients were becoming blind.
There were problems.
Let's go!
Ah ! I must admit !
It's brutal !
You're right, it's a strange one !
A Polish woman used to have
it for breakfast.
Must admit it's a man's drink.
You know what this reminds me of ?
The strange stuff we used to
drink in a bar at Biên Hoa, ..
.. near Saigon.
Red blinds..
.. and the lady boss :
a lovely blond !
What was her name ?
Lulu from Nantes.
You knew her?
It's got an apple taste.
It does contain apples.
Lucien the Horse got done in
outside her joint.
Who did it ?
What ?
I'm losing my head.
Teddy of Montreal, ..
..a nutcase who only worked
with dynamite.
Those were the days.
Are you sulking ?
Sulk ? Me ?
You must be joking.
I'm tired of clandestine love.
Phone kissing..
..even twice a day, it's sweet...
..but I am a man !
And all this because
of your uncle !
Looks like you're all afraid of him !
I'm gonna talk to him.
About what ?
I'm gonna talk to him..
..about our wedding.
About you, me, ..
.. us !
Repeat what you just said.
About you...
About me...
No, no.
Just the beginning,
that was the best.
OK, ok.
I'm not saying that towards the end, ..
..Jo-the-shakes had not slowed down.
But during the dreadful years...
..under the Germans, he was
killing left, right and centre.
He decimated and entire Panzerdivision
He was into tanks ?
No, lemonade. Listen !
I'm losing my head !
Jo had his fabrication secrets.
Where's the john?
End of the corridor, take a right.
Eh ! Eh ! Eh ! Eh !
50 kg of potatoes, ..
..1 bag of wood chips.
He'd make 25 litres of
3-star moonshine with his still !
Jo. A real magician !
That's why I take it upon
myself to discipline
..certain disrespectful people, ..
..who should shut the fuck up.
Ah !
Hum !
You know...
There's not just apple.
There's something else...
Beetroot maybe ?
Right !
There's some of that.
What do they teach you in school, darling ?
Pretty girls know too much these days !
Here's how I see your future.
Would you like to know?
No, no, no.
I shall tell you anyway.
I see an international career,
travels...
Egypt, for instance.
That's unusual.
And the good part is that an artist
gets top class treatment over there.
- Patricia !
Are you looking for something ?
No, he was inviting me to Egypt.
What ?
I was saying Egypt, but...
I could have said ... Lebanon !
Monsieur owns a travel agency ?
No, he's into prostitution.
Rather common. Let's go !
I would not mind eating
something more substantial.
I beg your pardon !
Your niece is going out with a
jealous man.
We were just talking.
Me, you know me,
the reserved type
All smoothness.
And this little shit
came looking for trouble!
Don't be rude !
Antoine ?
Monsieur Antoine !
If he doesn't walk through the doors, ..
..He'll be thrown right through them !
I would not be surprised to find out
that we are about to close.
Yes, everybody ! Parasites !
We are from good French families !
They're no ragheads !
Alcohol breeds
excess familiarity.
Who drank?
Oh !
Apple juice !
I will teach you tact!
I'll kick your ass until you learn  !
Out, it's closing time !
Go !
Go, Go !
Come on, we're closing!
Oh !
Go, go ! We're closing !
Go !
This way out!
Out !
Take your hand off her!
Go!
Go, go !
Come on, come on !
Everyone go to bed !
Off you go !
Well...
What were we talking about ?
Our younger days.
Eh ! Oh ! Oh !
Wake up !
Wake up !
What are you doing here ?
I must tell you..
..Melle Patricia
did not go to school.
What ?
Patricia is not in class.
The school called.
She's gonna go to school !
Straight away !
Is she gone ?
Impossible !
Just like her mother.
I don't see the connection ?
Her mother had this habit of
always running away.
Suzanne was raised in the gutter.
At 16, she was top girl at Mme Reine's.
No connection.
We could alert the police.
The Mexican would turn in his grave.
Call the fuzz !
Sometimes, you're really off your rocker !
Jean !
Monsieur?
Did you see the girl ?
As usual, at 8 am.
Did you notice anything ?
Yes, luggage.
What ?
But but...
You tell me this now !
I can't believe it !
The kid goes to school
with her luggage, ..
..you find that normal ?
Go on boy..
..or he'll break
your dirty face !
Great help !
Thank you, gentlemen.
Ah ! Yes !
What's that ?
The number for the cab that she took.
Yes, Sir.
Over there ?
Yes, I carried her luggage.
3rd house.
She's crazy !
We always say that when they leave us.
Wait, give me 5 minutes.
Call another cab !
I don't want to be the bad guy.
Spilling the beans is not
a nice thing to do.
6,50.
In this job, breakups, ..
..reunions, it's
best not to get involved.
One of my colleagues, specializing
in transporting men cheated upon, ..
..got himself riddled with bullets,
in broad daylight, ..
..by a clumsy woman.
Keep the change !
Thank you.
Hey !
Don't be too hard on her.
Goddamit !
Where can we find any peace?
In Greenland?
I was about to reach the perfect disharmony!
Can you believe it !
Spherical music.
How to make you understand,
you primitive man !
May I ?
Ah ! No !
When you'll be finished playing
with your cleaning appliances...
Ah ! I was expecting that one !
Appliances !
The irony of the primate !
First degree humour.
The bourgeois sarcasm !
You know bulldozers, ..
..tractors, ..
..but your opinions on art, ..
.. you can use them as
suppositories !
Children suppositories, even !
After throwing me out,
I don't quite understand...
Where is Patricia ?
...why are you here !
Where is Patricia ?!
- Here, uncle !
Good morning !
But ...
Patricia ..what are you doing here ?
What's the meaning of all this ?
You see, I'm cooking stew,
bain-marie, ragout.
I'm giving Antoine serenity
for our future.
What ?
Logical, isn't it ?
If he is to spend his life with me...
Spend his life ?
You must have lunch with us !
Darling !
Go down to the Italian store !
Bordeaux or Burgundy ?
We'll have both.
What's wrong ?
Nothing, I'm going crazy, that's all.
My dinner's burning !
You can come in, you know !
Listen , Patricia.
Why did you leave like that ?
We were worried sick !
Why did you throw Antoine out ?
You want my opinion ?
Taste this.
Lacks character.
No, I was talking about your Antoine !
"My Antoine", You are right !
We're getting married !
Now, let's not get ahead of
ourselves here !
Do you love him ?
Enough to marry him ?
Too much. It's a waste.
This story deserved a
tragic liaison, ..
..something Spanish, Russian !
Come on !
Have a scotch !
You'll forget yesterday's drinks.
I didn't drink anything yesterday. Not this !
You were walking up and down..
..the whole of last night !
You ran a bath twice.
Nerves...
Tell me...
You're not coming back too late?
We wouldn't want the future in-laws
..to think we live in sin !
Your Antoine, putting on airs...
I'm sure he does have a family
like everybody else !
I'm a survivor from a family
shaken by colonial wars,..
..divorces and accidents :
Dad !
Adolphe-Amédée Delafoy
aka ''the President''.
He collects clocks, traffic fines...
..sentimental disappointments..
..and all medals
Except the rescuer medal.
Nice medal but difficult to get
if you're not from Britanny.
A strange man.
A father.
He shares your passion for art.
Counsel from Puvis de Chavanne...
Never heard of it.
He has.
Apart from that, an honest man.
With a taste for morality,
chambermaids..
..religion and director's fees.
You know what ?
He became vice-president..
..of the International Monetary Fund !
Oh !
What are you thinking about?
IMF...
Not bad, you know...
Happy birthday to..
..you! Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday, Fernand!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday, uncle !
Happy birthday, my dear man.
Good day and happiness, sir.
Health and Wealth.
You are too kind.
This was brought in..
..earlier on.
Sender :
"Volfoni Brothers".
Even though we kissed and made up
I'm touched.
Such a delicate gesture !
It's a clock !
Listen !
Happy birthday to..
..you! Happy birthday to..
..you! Happy..
..birthday to you!
Happy birthday!
There he goes.
Did you see that ?
Right when we're having peace!
He sings and then bam!
He's nuts !
And the crazy ones, I cure them !
I'll write him a prescription.
A severe one !
I'll show him !
He'll be scattered in small pieces...
When it becomes too much, I dynamite.
I scatter !
I punch holes !
We shouldn't have come.
Shut up !
Go check if he's sleeping.
Is the big oaf asleep ?
He will sleep better that way !
He will be listening to the angels,
our friend from Montauban.
Gonna send him back to the headoffice, ..
..last stop for the conceited.
Asshole !
Asshole !
Well...
Asshole !
- "Enigma in the affair of
the burning lorry.
"Among the pastis bottles
transported by the bootleggers,
''..some contained gazoline."
Burns better.
Indeed.
But Mr Fernand, ..
.. for the Volfonis, that's not good.
It's above all unjust.
That's a nice one !
They shoot me !
They kill Henri !
Actually they did not.
Euh...
Go ahead ! Explain !
If the Volfonis had you
and Henri killed...
.. who would carry it out ?
Me. Hired gun number one !
And it was not me.
Tell me something, ..
..Théo, our German friend.
How would you assess him?
Can't be trusted.
Can you pass on a message ?
If the Volfonis are not involved, yes.
Presented that way,
sounds interesting.
Well, ..
..you can go see Théo at his retreat.
He must feel like talking to someone, ..
.. speak out.
He knows you guys well, ..
..he might confide in you.
He would not keep any secrets from you.
I don't think so.
That would be outright teasing.
We dropped by the distillery.
Théo wasn't there. We saw Tomate.
Strange, no ?
* Was he there ?
He told us what he was doing there.
- Poor Tomate.
I didn't think he'd leave us that early.
One less for us to handle.
Are you happy?
If Tomate is dead, means
the other one understood..
..and our turn will soon come.
But now, we have law on our side.
Law?
Self-defense.
With me, no quarters given.
My dear, we have visitors.
So much for surprise.
Their turn !
Oh !
Shit !
I do not ask if
you know how to open them.
I do not ask if
Monsieur knows how to use it.
You were expecting someone ?
No.
Could it be a trick ?
Would you kindly announce
me to Mr Naudin, please ?
Who may I announce ?
Who may I announce, Monsieur?
What ? Speak up !
Who may I announce ?
Ah ! President Delafoy.
Antoine Delafoy's father.
President Delafoy !
Since you're not doing it, I'll
announce myself. President Delafoy.
I am absolutely delighted to make
your acquaintance.
I see you're not messing about.
I like that.
I love action, initiative.
When I was young, I used to
play hockey.
Good heavens !
Late 18th century
By Ferdinand Berthoud !
Pest !
Oh !
Unless my daughter-in-law
is attached to it, ..
..I wouldn't mind trading it in
for something else.
What ?
Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself.
Well, ..
..Monsieur, ..
.. I have the privilege..
..of asking for your niece's hand ..
..for my son, Antoine.
Ah !
This 'Yes' comes from the heart.
I expected nothing less.
Well, well... you see !
This house is ravishing.
All this greenery...
The calm...
Monsieur.
You see, nothing can beat..
..these family homes..
..with these attics where
we played when we were kids.
I think I heard something...
Yes, it's...
It's the gardener, killing moles !
James !
Monsieur.
Tell him to make less noise.
I will try to make him understand.
Did you inherit this ?
A family heirloom ?
Did you find it in Paris ?
You're killing me !
What ?
This.
Oh, but...
What is that ?
Termites.
What ?
Termites - they eat everything !
The problem with these old homes...
Oh !
Pests !
The horrible ones !
Split up, they're no fun.
I'm not interested in their
Siamese twin act.
Must admit god is not on our side.
But at least we didn't take the
hardware out for nothing.
I'm not saying it isn't unfair.
I'm telling you..
..makes one feel better.
- Ah ! Perfect !
Absolutely perfect !
A dinner jacket, ..
..is difficult to wear.
But it looks real good on Monsieur.
You have the body of a diplomat.
Very nice !
Send your bill as  soon as possible.
I'm going back to the countryside
the day after tomorrow.
Don't move !
Thank you.
Uncle, it's fabulous.
I did not know we had so many friends.
More than you think.
Mademoiselle !
You seem relaxed, happy.
You can say that again.
My mission as a tutor is over.
As for the businesses that
constitute Patricia's dowry,
.. your father will take over.
They are a tad... peculiar.
With a vice-president of the IMF
in charge,..
..everything will be fine.
Especially with dad.
He does not understand the present,
the future,..
Does not understand France, Europe.
But he would understand anything
about money.
Is it for real ?
Mr Fernand !
Old Paris.
Ah !
- Mr Fernand !
Mr Fernand !
What ?
New developments.
Théo is at the distillery with the others.
What ?
They are moving.
They're about to run away.
Are you there ?
Jean !
Bravo !
Bastien is standing guard.
Shhh !
We thought we'd leave Théo for you to handle.
We've known bosses who would
take offense otherwise.
Well ...
Tell Patricia I have an
errand to run.
I'll catch up in church.
I suggest you don't go empty-handed.
Have you ever seen me leave
without the necessary?
Days like this,
you're not yourself.
Ok ! Let's go !
No, you ...
Come on, quick !
I saw 3, there may be more.
Mr Fernand,
Do we wait for them to come out?
Siege or assault?
I have no time to wait.
Come on, let's go !
Right !
They are coming.
Here they are.
- What is this ?
this ?
In case you must fire in full auto.
If they all come out at the same
time , tatata... hop !
Resistance habits die hard !
Stop these children games !
Are we done ?
I'm in a hurry !
Pascal, eh !
There it is !
Ah !
Ouh !
Boss...
Oh ! Shit !
With the jacket, it will be fine.
You ok ?
Yes, ok.
Close one !
