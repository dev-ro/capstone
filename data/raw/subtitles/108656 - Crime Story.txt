Did you check the Mark Six
lottery numbers yet?
What for? If this goes weII,
it'II be better than winning the Iottery!
Let's do it!
HeIp!
Gag him!
You bastard!
Watch how you drive!
He strangIed me from behind
and then his car hit us.
Son of a bitch!
You're the one who stopped suddenIy!
If he stopped so suddenIy,
don't you know how to stop too!
- Don't taIk to my brother Iike that!
- Or what?
Are you two done fighting?
With peopIe Iike you, how are we
supposed to kidnap Wong Yat-Fei?
Do you think he's a corpse?
He's bound to fight back!
Shit...
When we're in action, remember
to switch off aII pagers!
If something unexpected happens,
know what to do!
Inspector Chan,
Triad Bureau.
Gun?
Sign here.
Go straight in.
Thank you.
Inspector Chan, it happened
48 hours ago, but you're stiII so tense.
- What's the probIem?
- Tense? Not at aII.
Then pIease run through
what happened.
I'm in a Iot of pain...
PoIice! Don't move!
Sorry.
It's okay.
You're stiII insisting
that you're not tense?
Fucker!
The psychoIogicaI pressure feIt by
our coIIeagues who've had to fire a gun
can be divided into
three different groups.
The first group is worried
about hurting the innocent.
The second is worried about
getting injured during the gunfight.
You damn cop, show your face!
Out of the way!
The Iast group cannot handIe
the pressure of having kiIIed someone
after firing at the criminaI.
According to what you've said,
your circumstances
fit the profiIe of the Iast group.
This means you cannot handIe
the pressure of having kiIIed
someone by gunshot.
Even if you're right,
if you were in my shoes,
may I ask what you wouId you do?
Me? I wouId suggest to my superior that
I need a hoIiday and rest for a whiIe.
Thank you very much!
I don't need to rest.
You can write up the report however
you want. That's aII. Goodbye.

We aII swear today, March 1 1 , 1 9)9)0,
to be bonded as brothers.
We were born on different days,
but we pIedge to die on the same day.
Today, we five brothers
swear on our spiIt bIood
to join forces to erase
the corrupt businessman, Wong Yat-Fei.
May good deeds be rewarded,
and eviI deeds punished.
We act as emissaries of Heaven,
to take away his iII-gotten gains.
If anyone betrays a brother,
then he wiII be struck by Iightning.
If anyone betrays our honour,
then he wiII die without Ieaving a corpse.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Superintendent Cheung
is Iooking for you.
He asked that you go to his office
as soon as you arrive.
Okay, thanks.
I pay miIIions in tax every year.
You poIice shouId do something about it.
This is Inspector Chan.
This is Mr. Yat-Fei Wong.
Mr. Wong suspects someone
wants to kidnap him. I want to Iisten to this.
It's not suspicions, I have proof.
I sent a staff member to take photos
to see if someone was steaIing
materiaIs from the construction site.
We discovered this car has been
parked for four consecutive days
in front of the construction site gates.
These peopIe show up every day.
Is this over-sensitivity a resuIt of
your being kidnapped Iast time?
There is definiteIy not
any over-sensitivity on my part,
onIy my intuition
aIerting me to troubIe.
Your intuition?
Correct.
Inspector Chan, take a seat.
Don't underestimate my intuition.
30% of my success is a resuIt of
my abiIities and hard work.
70% was a resuIt of decisions made
of the basis of my intuition.
During the 1 9)67 riots, I made
the decision to buy a Iot of Iand.
In 1 9)7 4, onIy I had the guts to bid for
the Shatin Fotan factory area
that everyone eIse thought
was worthIess.
These decisions that
made a Iot of money
were not a resuIt of my foresight,
but of my intuition.
Mr. Wong,
do you think that your being
kidnapped three years ago
has possibIy made you
more anxious in the Iong run?
It's possibIe. So wiII you do
something about it or not?
We wiII investigate.
Inspector Chan, foIIow up this case.
What's the matter with you?
I've paged you for severaI weeks,
but you haven't repIied!
I have to work, missy!
BuII!
What cop case are you working on
that keeps you away
for more than eight weeks?
Don't teII me you got assigned
as an undercover cop.
What are you after, missy?
To know everything about
what's happening at the station?
I don't know anything.
I onIy know that
you're a smaII time detective
with onIy about HKD 20 000 in saIary.
Why don't you quit? I'II support you.
Hah! As if I needed you to support
me financiaIIy!
What about my Iack of face then?
WeII? Are you aII sweaty now?
Get in the car.
Come back and take a bath.
I don't have time.
I'II come up to your pIace Iater.
What?
What are you up to now?
I'm in the middIe of something.
I'II Iook you up when I'm done.
Work, work, work...
TeII me what you're up to!
You can't Ieave tonight
if you don't teII me!
Nag, nag, nag!
Damn you! Get Iost!
You bastard! You dare to drop me!
I'II just go and meet someone eIse!
You think no-one wouId be interested
if I'm wiIIing to spread my Iegs?
There wouId be a queue from
Tsim Sha Tsui to Sha Tau Kok!
AsshoIe!
Everyone with money is fIeeing
as if it were 1 9)9)7 again.
The outIook for Iuxury fIats
wiII worsen for a Iong time yet.
Stephen,
I've decided to change the pIans;
instead of buiIding 2000 sq. ft. fIats,
divide them into four 500 sq. ft. fIats.
I've worked it out. This type of smaII
fIat is best suited for smaII famiIies.
I'm sure that it wiII seII weII.
Boss, if we spIit one fIat into four,
with onIy 70% of the area being usabIe,
then one can onIy fit a bed and
no wardrobe in the bedroom.
Nah,
you get what you pay for.
If I seII my fIats at a Iow price,
even a bIue-coIIar worker
can afford a mortgage.
The BuiIding Authority won't approve
it in time if we make changes now.
Don't worry about it.
Just do as I say.
Change the pIans for aII the other
construction sites too.
You can just make the changes whiIe
submitting the new pIans to the BA.
Contact the contractor to have the
workers start working nights too.
If we seII the fIats earIier,
we'II make the money back.
-The sooner it's finished, the better.
- Yes.
CID! Don't move! CID!
So what if you're CID?
Don't move! PoIice!
''Pay our wages''?
PAY OUR WAGES
- What?
- PoIice.
- Can't I coIIect the wages owed to me?
- Move!
So what if you're cops?
Mr. Wong, it seems that they're not
here to kidnap you.
It's not that simpIe.
- Work is avaiIabIe; wages aren't!
- PAY OUR WAGES QUICK!
Wong Yat-Fei, a heartIess scoundreI!
Work is avaiIabIe; wages aren't!
Wong Yat-Fei, a...
... the wages aren't!
Wong Yat-Fei, a heartIess scoundreI!
Work is avaiIabIe; wages aren't!
Wong Yat-Fei, a heartIess scoundreI!
CID! Don't start any troubIe!
- Come on, guys!
- Let's get him!
- Stay caIm!
- Arrest them!
Why are you arresting my coIIeagues!
You think you cops
can just arrest anyone!
Arrest me! Arrest me!
Put away your guns!
Everyone back up!
Back up!
See here...
Keep your cooI, everyone!
And if we don't?
What the heII?!
- Losing my cooI doesn't kiII me!
- Arrest him!
Let go!
- Fight them!
- Fight them!
Step back!
Step back!
Step back!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Listen to me, everyone!
Stay caIm!
Can't you stay caIm?
- Stay caIm?!
- How?!
We're Iike you, saIaried empIoyees!
- I've...
- You understand then!
...never experienced
the frustrations of not getting paid.
But I haven't successfuIIy
negotiated a raise either!
Nothing's come of aII the taIk about
a stipend for dangerous duties!
We want to protest at a raIIy too!
You think we're your enemy?!
Then why are you stopping us
demonstrating?!
As Iong as you foIIow the ruIes and
petition to demonstrate,
as poIice,
we can even cIear the streets for you!
Hong Kong is supposedIy
governed by the Iaw!
- That's not true!
- That's not true!
SuperficiaIIy, everyone is an equaI.
The duty of the poIice is to protect
each citizen.
I sympathise with you chasing
your back wages.
But if a rich man makes a caII,
we stiII have to show up.
So my advice to you
is to uphoId the Iaw!
I don't want someone to take
advantage of this situation
to stir up troubIe, damage private
property and injure someone!
If that happens,
we have to make arrests!
Do you understand?!
Leave immediateIy!
That makes sense...
- ReIease the man.
- Yes, sir.
Wong Yat-Fei!
You vampire!
Making money off our sweat and bIood!
You wiII come to a bad end!
May your sons be born deformed!
This is a matter between
the contractors and Iabourers.
Right?
Yes.
Hey, Inspector Chan.
They attacked the poIice.
You're just going to arrest one man?
Mr. Wong, this a Iabour dispute.
It has nothing to do with the
Organised Crime and Triad Bureau.
Why don't I caII the Labour
Department for you?
That wouId be unnecessary.
We'II deaI with it ourseIves.
If you paid wages,
then everything wouId be aII right.
ReIease the man.
Attention, troops patrolling above.
We are now leaving the scene.
Continue to monitor the situation.
If the workers return,
send them away.
Don't add to their difficuIties.
This guy is a renowned cheapskate.
- Ah Fei?
- Yes?
I don't feeI weII.
Have you taken your medicine?
I took it aIready.
In that case, why don't you Iower
the seat and rest for a bit.
Okay.
Everyone, Iet's toast Peter, MichaeI,
and David for getting promoted!
Hip, hip, hooray!
Hip, hip, hooray!
Hip, hip, hooray!
Wife, we're being taiIed.
Ah Fei, wiII you stop being so
suspicious and nervous aII the time?
No, I have to caII the cops.
Don't caII the poIice
at the sIightest provocation.
We're tax-paying citizens.
When there's troubIe,
we're entitIed to poIice protection.
Inspector Chan,
this is Wong Yat-Fei.
Someone's on my tail.
Where are you?
I'm on Peak Rd, driving home.
I suspect that someone
wants to kidnap me.
CouId it be the construction workers
wanting to speak about their wages?
Of course not! I've already settled
things with the workers.
Regardless, come here immediately!
Hey, something's up!
He's caIIing someone.
Forget it!
Let's get him!
This is for reaI again!
What's the probIem?
Kidnapping!
Don't hit my husband!
Don't hit my husband!
Shut up, bitch!
Stop!
Don't hit my husband!
- His wife's here too!
- What? His wife's there?!
- HeIp! HeIp!
- Shut up!
Why didn't you look before you leaped?
What do you think you're doing?!
Bro, what shouId we do?
How shouId I know?!
Okay, kidnap his wife too!
Be careful!
His wife has a weak heart!
If she dies,
who do we get the money from?!
Organised Crime and Triad Bureau.
- Superintendent Cheung.
- Who's speaking?
Eddie Chan of SpeciaI Ops.
Inspector Chan, pIease verify
your badge number and password.
Can't I just report a crime?!
We need the password
to connect the call...
The car coming up behind
is a CID car.

We're now at the scene of the injured

Did something happen to Ah Wing?
I don't know.
I've only heard about Little Hak.

Don't worry about me!
Save him! Stop his bIeeding!
That's my patient.
Let me see what's happening.

How are my coIIeagues?
They're in the operation rooms.
They'II be fine.
- I have to check on them.
- Don't move around.
- The wound wiII reopen.
- Get out of my way!
Hey, hey!
- At Ieast Iet me remove the needIe.
- Eddie! Let the doctor remove it first.
Do you reaIise
that you Iost a Iot of bIood too?
It's best if you rest a whiIe.
I go out and risk my Iife!
Two of my coIIeagues stiII need
emergency medicaI care!
You're just deskbound,
what do you know!
With your current mentaI state,
you're unfit for duty right now.
You have to take a Ieave of absence,
and Iet me monitor you for a whiIe.
To you, it's monitoring.
To me, it's suspension of duty!
Your superior
wants a report about you.
Look at how tense you are now!
How do you expect me to write it up?
Write whatever you want!
You don't have to use
my superior officer to Iean on me!
Chi-Keung!

Where's my husband?
- How is he?

- Good. Good.
Thank you very much, doctor.
Move her to the front
and get him on the boat.
She isn't dead, is she?
- Step on the pedaI.
- Okay.
Anything?
Let's set saiI quickIy!
CIean up the surroundings,
and push the car into the sea.
UnIess absoIuteIy necessary,
don't caII me in the near future.
Yesterday evening, ApriI 1 6,
at approximateIy 6:30pm,
Hong Kong reaI estate deveIoper
Wong Yat-Fei and his wife
were kidnapped on the Peak Road
whiIe on the way home.
Before this occurred,
Wong Yat-Fei caIIed me, reIating his
suspicions of a possibIe kidnapping.
After the caII,
I immediateIy drove to the scene.
I ran into the criminaIs that kidnapped
Wong Yat-Fei on Peak Road.
They drove 4 different cars
Mr. and Mrs. Wong Yat-Fei's car
was a cream Mercedes Benz.
I tried to stop them,
but I faiIed in the end.
In the process, two traffic poIicemen
were hit by the criminaIs' cars
and seriousIy injured, one of whom
has aIready passed away.
The criminaIs reIeased Mrs. Wong
by the seafront off ApIeichau,
and demanded that she ready
a ransom in three days.
The ransom demand is
USD 60 000 000.
- USD 60 miIIion?
- That's a Iot...
That's HKD 500 miIIion.
Listen up, everyone!
The first step now is to have
the CriminaI InteIIigence Bureau
instaII bugs in Mrs. Wong's residence
and her usuaI haunts to monitor
aII caIIs 24 hours a day,
paying cIose attention
to aII criminaI activities.
Second step:
Teams 1 and 2 of Operations wiII do
a fuII coverage bIanket search
of aII possibIe hideouts
in Hong Kong, KowIoon, New
Territories, and outIying isIands.
Third step:
Find information on aII the top Triad
car racers in Hong Kong.
The rest of you wiII go to hostess bars,
gambIing dens, drug houses,
and Iove hoteIs to conduct
surprise searches,
and arrest every possibIe
suspect for questioning.
Do you understand?
Master Hung.
Hey, I haven't seen you in a whiIe.
Why are you working so Iate?
Yeah, I can't beIieve
I've been recaIIed at this Iate hour.
AII hoIidays have been canceIIed.
PIease report back to your poIice
station immediateIy.
Yes. There's a case that requires
immediate attention.
These are the names and addresses of
the shops that Mrs. Wong frequents.
Master Hung.
Hi, hi.
Superintendent Cheung!
Wow! You've gained weight since
I Iast saw you a whiIe ago.
Hey! I can say the same for you.
Hey, Inspector Chan!
Let me introduce you to Master Hung.
He's the guy who cracked
Wong Yat-Fei's first kidnapping,
so that's why I invited him
to heIp us out.
I hope I can Iearn a Iot from you.
I heard from the others
that you were very brave today.
I was just foIIowing
your exampIe, that's aII.
Superintendent Cheung. I'm going
to step outside to answer this caII.
It may be a caII from an informer.
Okay.
Hey, foIIow up on this for me, okay?
Master Hung. We're in troubIe.
There's a mainIand gunboat.
It looks like it's approaching us.
What should we do now?
Try your best to evade it!
We're in the middle of the sea.
Where do you expect us to hide?
If you can't evade them,
jump overboard! Use your brain!
Just don't Iet them see
the kidnap victim.
I'm in a meeting at the poIice station.
Don't bother me any more.
You won't deaI with anything
because you're in a meeting?
Stop the vesseI for an inspection!
What are you doing here?
I'm a fisherman, not a smuggIer.
I'm going back to Hong Kong
earIy tomorrow morning.
There's nothing in the hoId.
Don't make any more noise,
or eIse I'II drown you!
You've crossed the border aIready.
- Once dawn comes, go back quickIy.
- Thank you.
Troops, dismissed!
The troops are dismissed.
Let's go!
Inspector Chan!
HeIIo?
I want to speak to Mrs. Wong.
This is she.
If you want to save
your husband's life,
then withdraw USD 60 million
from the Wanchai branch of Chase
Manhattan Bank at 10am tomorrow.
1 0am at the Wanchai
Chase Manhattan Bank.
I'll call you on your mobile then.
Bring more batteries.
HeIIo? HeIIo?
Rewind it so I can Iisten to it.
Keep two peopIe here
to Iisten to the caIIs.
Notify the ground troops,
the aeriaI troops,
the wiretap team,
- and Operations to depIoy at the bank.
- LA PRIME FACIAL SALON
- Operations, copy.
- Lower, okay? More towards me.
Operations, team four and five.
Monitor the streets around the bank.
If the criminaIs caII,
immediateIy report to aII units.
HeIIo?
- Is this Mrs. Wong?
- This is she.
This is the wiretap team caIIing HQ.
I'm now transmitting to aII units
the diaIogue between Mrs. Wong
and the criminaIs.
Have you prepared
aII that I requested Iast night?
I've prepared everything.
Now I'm following your instructions,
and I'm on my way to the bank
in Central. I'll be there in five minutes.
Listen carefully, don't go to Central.
Go to the Admiralty branch now.
- They changed the meeting point!
- Okay, I'II go there now.
Man the originaI post
in case they go back there.
The rest, come with me.
CaIIing HQ. Requesting
additionaI support.
Mobilise all backup personnel
to the area around the Chase
Manhattan Bank in Admiralty
to monitor all activities.
We're heading there now.
Backup ground troops have now arrived
at the Chase Manhattan in Admiralty.
Mrs. Wong's car is now on the Wanchai
bridge, going towards the Admiralty.
HeIIo?
Mrs. Wong, expect a caII
from me Iater. Do not wonder who I am.
Why is he speaking Mandarin?
We traced the first caII.
It wasn't from Hong Kong.
Continue the trace.
You trace the origin of
the Mandarin caII.
Mrs. Wong has now arrived at the
bank, but the target has not arrived.
Go into the bank,
and covert the USD 60 miIIion
into 50 cashier's cheques.
Mrs. Wong entered the bank.
I'll be in touch later.
Good morning, Mrs. Wong.
PIease withdraw USD 60 miIIion
from my account.
Once she withdraws the money,
the criminaI shouId show up.
- What's the situation now?
- There's another incoming caII.
Mrs. Wong's
exiting from a side door.
Go the United Chinese Bank
three blocks away.
Eddie, Mrs. Wong is now going to
United Chinese Bank,
the one that's three blocks away.
I've done aII that you've asked.
I converted the cashier's cheques.
You said to change banks,
and I changed banks.
I onIy want to speak briefIy with my
husband. Why won't you Iet him taIk?
Mrs. Wong's on the overpass,
walking towards United Chinese Bank.
Your husband is very safe right now.
As soon as we get the money,
we'll release the hostage.
Don't try any tricks, or I won't be able
to guarantee your husband's safety.
I won't try anything.
Please don't harm him.
Don't aIarm Mrs. Wong in any way.
You're aII taiIing her too cIoseIy.
Move back a few steps.
Not aII of you!
Act more naturaIIy when taiIing her.
I traced the first caII to Shenzhen.
Get me the Shenzhen
PubIic Security Bureau.
Yes.
HeIIo.
Superintendent, we have the Shenzhen
Public Security Bureau on the phone.
HeIIo, Commissioner Lai,
we have to bother you again.
Ah, you're too poIite.
We're happy to heIp in any way.
BeetIe, beetIe. Mrs. Wong has
aIready entered your monitoring area.
Pay attention to aII suspicious-Iooking
peopIe around Mrs. Wong.
Hey, Iet me get it.
HeIIo.
Please tell Superintendent Cheng
that call in Mandarin came from Taiwan.
Okay, thank you.
What's up?
Have you traced the caII
in Mandarin yet?
I haven't heard back from them yet.
Now, I want you
to deposit the cashier's cheques into
United Chinese Bank, Taipei branch.
- 3032... 377 068...
- Taipei branch? What account?
3032-377-068...
- and 377-069...
- Input what's she's saying.
In case Mrs. Wong
comes out the bank again,
those whom she has seen must
change their clothes.
I'm now changing. Continue keeping
an eye on Mrs. Wong.
We've traced it. The money has been
deposited in more than ten accounts
in the Taipei branch of United
Chinese Bank.
CaII Taiwan's
NationaI PoIice Administration.
HeIIo.
Commissioner Shen, pIease.
Speaking.
Is something the matter?
Commissioner Shen.
This is Hong Kong PoIice OCTB's
Superintendent Cheung caIIing.
Commissioner Shen,
the ransom money of a kidnapping
has been deposited
into more than ten accounts in
the United Chinese Bank in Taipei.
CouId you pIease Iook into it
and freeze the money?
Superintendent Cheung,
as the kidnapping
didn't happen in Taiwan,
under our laws, we have no right to
interfere in commercial transactions.
Commissioner Shen, I suspect that
these criminaIs are terrorists
and wiII use this money to fund
iIIegaI activities in Taiwan.
PIease don't be so impatient.
I'm transferring the funds now.
-Yes, yes, yes...
- We're remitted USD 30 miIIion.
- USD 30 miIIion is aIready remitted.
- Continue to transfer the funds.
Don't fool around
with your husband's life.
PIease don't worry. I'm aIready
remitting the money to you now.
Once you receive the money,
remember to reIease my husband.
The pubIic phone on MeiIin St.
Thank you.
Superintendent Chueng, we've traced
the caII from Shenzhen.
- Superintendent Cheung
- What's up?
The accounts in Taiwan are Iisted
under four peopIe's names.
They said they wouId fax the detaiIs
of the accounts to us Iater.
Eddie, Iisten up. Stop Mrs. Wong
from remitting the money.
I don't care what you
have to do to stop her,
but once all the money
has been transferred,
I'm afraid we'll lose
our connection to the criminals.
I've now arrived at the bank.
- Sir, you can't enter this area.
- OCTB!
- OCTB.
- Sir, you can't enter this area.
- Here...
- Excuse us. We're CID.
- Excuse us. We're CID.
- Hey!
We're working on a case.
Can't you caII back Iater?
My mobiIe's battery is dying.
I'II be quick
about changing the battery.
Don't try anything.
I'II caII you in a minute.
Hey, mister...
- He's Iooking for me.
- Mrs. Wong.
The poIice need you to stop
remitting the money.
Mrs. Wong.
Even after the criminaIs
receive the money,
they may kiII the hostage
at any time for safety's sake.
I don't have any other option.
What do you want me to do?
First you teII me to pay the ransom,
now you teII me not to pay.
I don't care! I'II do anything as Iong as
I can save my husband!
Mrs. Wong.
We're transferring the fourth
remittance.
The amount is USD1 4 miIIion.
Continue the transfer.
Once aII the money
is remitted to Taiwan,
we'II Iose the criminaIs,
and won't soIve the case.
I don't care.
As Iong as my husband comes back.
SoIving the case is poIice business!
Mrs. Wong.
Over the years, there have been 1 5
cases where the hostages were kiIIed
even after the ransom was paid. I don't
want your husband to be the 1 6th victim.
Do you beIieve the criminaIs
or the poIice?
Stop the remittance.
Mrs. Wong has stopped
remitting the money.
Wire tap team, continue monitoring
the situation 24 hours a day.
Ground troops, continue
covertIy protecting Mrs. Wong.
Damn bitch! PIaying tricks on me!
- That way!
- Go! Go!
Halt!
Stay still!
HeIIo? HeIIo? HeIIo?!
Superintendent Chueng,
Taiwan has faxed the detaiIs of
the account hoIders.
Ah Fei, what wiII happen now?
I don't even know if USD 30 miIIion
is going to save you or not.
Ask them to heIp us.
We have no dipIomatic reIations with them,
and there aren't any extradition Iaws.
The onIy soIution is to send
someone over. But who?
Superintendent Cheung.
I know Taiwan quite weII.
Why don't I go?
Okay.
I'II send someone to assist you.
Hey! Do you have to be this nervous?
I can never beIieve that such a big
piece of metaI can fIy in the sky.
I'd be Iying if I said I wasn't afraid.
Hey, why don't you treat this
as an officiaI expense?
Once we arrive in Taipei, we'II find a
nice hoteI, then have a good meaI.
Look at the data.
Any cIues about who this man is?
This man is caIIed Simen Ting.
Do you know him?
No. I've never seen him.
I wonder if the Taiwanese
are wiIIing to heIp or not.
Who cares. As I said, Iet's enjoy
ourseIves for two nights
and consider that mission
accompIished.
Sir, there's air turbuIence.
PIease return to your seat.
- I'm CID. I'm interrogating a suspect.
- Okay.
Do you aIways take things this IightIy?
What's the point of being so serious?
I've given 30 years of my youth
to the RoyaI PoIice force.
TeII me,
what have I received in return?
- Then what do you want?
- I don't know.
I onIy know that every night I wake up
from my dreams
feeIing that I've Iet myseIf down.
When I first came out of the
academy, energetic and gung ho,
I was even braver than you are now.
- When you're exchanged gunfire,
- Attention, all passengers...
- when you've shot someone...
- please return to your seats
- I bet it scared you!
- and fasten your seatbelts.
I dare you to say
that you weren't afraid!
Sir, it's dangerous
if you don't return to your seat.
I'm used to danger. If it isn't
dangerous, I want my money back.
Hey, take a seat
and fasten your seatbeIt.
Don't be afraid.
The air stewardesses
often make a fuss over nothing!
- Hey! Are you okay?
- Thank you.
- Captain Ko, the guns are in there.
- Put them away.
- How are you? I'm Eddie Chan.
- How are you?
- This is Inspector Hung.
- Why don't you give me the papers.
PIease go ahead.
We don't have dipIomatic reIations.
We don't have officiaI ties
with InterpoI, so this...
- PIease speak.
- Start the car.
- PIease get in the car.
- Captain.
Okay.
This is Captain Ko.
Captain, a report.
There's a group of peopIe
at a house on Huahsi St.
One of them Iooks Iike Simen Ting.
I understand.
Attention ThunderboIt team, be at
the scene to keep an eye on them.
It's now 6:30. AII teams, meet up
at the HQ at seven. PIease get in the car.
- Copy.
- Copy, Captain.
Copy.
Form a depIoyment pIan immediateIy.
You aII, return to the HQ first.
- What's the current situation?
- Oh, nothing much.
This is the key to your hoteI room.
DeIiver the depIoyment pIan
to the Hsihua HoteI immediateIy.
We can onIy heIp you
in an unofficiaI capacity.
You don't have jurisdiction here.
Retire earIy tonight.
Don't go out on the town.
I'II contact you tomorrow. See you.
- See you.
- See you.
Let's go.
CouId you pIease
put them in our room?
Hey, where are we going?
Huahsi Street, didn't you hear them?
When we get there, then what?
We'II decide once we get there.
We want to get to Huahsi Street.
We've received the signaI. Don't aIert
the criminaIs to our presence for now.
Wait for orders.
- Continue the surveiIIance.
- When you're mobilised,
- And don't aIert them.
- be especially careful,
- I understand.
- and don't harm innocent citizens.
Captain.
Everything is ready.
Have I made myseIf cIear?!
Understood.
Let's move!
Stand guard. Same upstairs.
I'm rich! I'm rich!
BIack Dragon,
aIthough the money is in our hands,
what happens now determines
whether we can spend it.
Count carefuIIy! Count carefuIIy!
Wow, that idiot was reaIIy easy!
- Don't be aIarmed.
- Hush.
- Hey, what's happening?
- Don't be nervous, it's nothing.
Damn, when you're womanising,
you give 1 00%,
but when you're working,
you're dragging your feet!
Simen Ting, you're too timid!
We'd do better by pIaying it safe.
We're ready, ThunderboIt team.
Brother, there's Ioads of cops outside!
Damn! Hide the money quick!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
- PoIice, haIt!
- Watch out, it's the cops!
Go!
There're cops! Damn!
Let's go! Let's go!
HaIt! PoIice!
- We're armed!
- HaIt!
- Isn't that Simen Ting?
- What?
Hey!
Go this way, Iet's go!
What's happening up there?
Brother, Iet's go this way!
Is there any more Ieft? Look around!
This way!
- There's two Ieft.
- Use them, quickIy! Quick!
I'II bIow you to bits!
- Brother, where shaII we go?
- That way! That way!
Hey, take it sIow. Don't Ieave, I'II cry!
- BIack Dog, kiII him!
- Okay!
Let's go!
You don't know the meaning of death!
Get him!
Hey! Why are you stiII standing
there? Come and give chase!
Okay! I'm coming!
It's your turn!
Go that way!
Hurry up!
It's aII cops!
Why didn't you teII me
about aII this earIier?
I didn't know!
Think of an idea
or we're both done for!
I'm thinking!
If you don't heIp me,
I'II spiII everything!
He aImost dragged me down
with him!
You two, come down here!
MINISTR Y OF INTERIOR,
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BUREAU
I hope that you cooperate,
and teII me the truth.
Why did you chase him?
Why did you have to kiII him?
FirstIy, he was connected to
a kidnapping in Hong Kong.
SecondIy, a good citizen can make
a citizen's arrest of a criminaI.
It happened too quickIy!
- I just reacted!
- Why were you chasing that person?
I didn't want to chase him!
My superior wanted me to chase him!
I aIready toId you.
You don't have jurisdiction here!
You've vioIated our Iaws!
You have to write an apoIogy!
No!
My superior has aIways been
an impuIsive kind of guy!
Inspector Chan.
I now formaIIy charge you with
vioIating our nationaI security Iaw.
We were too rash in our zeaI
to crack the case.
We've caused you a Iot of troubIe.
I'm very sorry. We were wrong.
Why were you chasing that man?
Why did that man die
in front of you?
I request that you Iet me
caII Hong Kong.
Master Hung, thank you
for cooperating with us.
That's what I shouId do.
Why did you chase that person?
TeII me.
What's your reIationship
with that person?
TeII me now!
Was he working with both of you?
You Hong Kong poIice have
the most corrupt members, right?
If you don't heIp me,
then I'II spiII everything!
Hong Kong has corrupt poIice,
so does Taiwan.
What? What did you say?
What?
You dare to insuIt poIice in Taiwan?
There are so many Hong Kong
degenerates who break the Iaw,
then come to Taiwan
to escape the heat!
If you don't heIp me,
then I'II spiII everything!
Thank you for reIeasing them.
Don't worry, I'II punish them.
Good, I wiII give you
a reasonabIe account.
Okay, Okay... thank you,
Comissioner Shen. Bye.
ImmediateIy search
Simen Ting's Hong Kong office.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
Despite the mess,
at Ieast we've achieved something.
- Sir, who are you Iooking for?
- CID, we're here to search the pIace.
- Our boss isn't here.
- Your boss is dead.
Don't touch anything!
Don't touch the computers!
Sit! Sit!
It's past visiting hours.
I'm from OCTB, what number bed
is Lau Hak-ming in, pIease?
Bed number eight.
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome.
Manager, this is Inspector Chan,
he wants to see you.
- What is it?
- I'm Eddie Chan from OCTB.
This is a warrant.
Inspector, do you want everything
from no. 1 to 1 00?
HeIIo?
Master Hung.
There's a Eddie Chan who's here to
inspect the data of pagers no. 1-100.
No. 1 -1 00? That means that
he's Iooking into mine too.
What should we do?
Erase aII the data on me.
Don't even Ieave a word.
Hey, what's wrong with
the computer?
You're right. I don't know.
Inspector, you can't mess with it.
Why is this happening?
Inspector Chan, I'm so sorry.
The computers are going haywire again.
Gaga, urgent, Hoi Saat
Hostess Club. See you at 369.
It's gone.
It's aIways breaking down.
I want to change them,
but they're out of stock,
so we're just using them for now.
Once the computers are fixed, I might
be abIe to retrieve the data for you.
Inspector Chan,
what are you Iooking for?
You can teII me.
Maybe I can heIp you.
If I'm abIe to heIp you, I definiteIy wiII.
Inspector Chan.
HeIIo,
LittIe Seh Ming.
Do you know a wise guy
caIIed Euro Boy?
I've never heard of him.
Let me ask around.
Let me know as soon as possibIe.
AIso, is there a code
or sIang caIIed 369)?
369? What 369?
Never mind.
How many Hostess CIubs
are there in Hong Kong?
There's only one in Tsim Sha Tsui.
Okay. If you find out anything,
caII me immediateIy.
That cop caused us to Iose
the money that was in front of us.
Okay, Iet's make him Iose
everything then.
He murdered Simen Ting.
Let's chop up Wong Yat-Fei into bits,
and feed him to the sharks.
We don't have to be so righteous.
Master Hung,
why don't you say something?
We can't Iet go of this affair.
EarIier, you made two mistakes.
Now that the hostage is at sea,
there's no set position, no target.
That cop isn't a superman. There's no way
that he can just find him.
AIthough Simen Ting is a goner,
getting a ransom from Taiwan
has proven to work.
After overcoming these two
difficuIties, we shouIdn't just give up.
As Iong as the poIice
can't find the hostage,
we can stiII Iean on the wife.
If she is wiIIing to pay once,
she'II be wiIIing to pay again.
Just wait and see.
Sir, we've found this photo
at Simen Ting's office.
The CriminaI InteIIigence Bureau
says it's worth Iooking into.
Why don't you say
something nice to your wife?
She says that she reaIIy misses you.
Why don't we record you taIking
to prove that you're stiII aIive?
Get up!
Hey, Gaga! You're earIy.
I'm free, so I'm earIy.
May I ask if you are Miss Gaga?
Yes. Who's asking?
I'm Inspector Chan of OCTB.
It's about Detective Hung.
We wouId Iike to ask you to cooperate
on an investigation.
What investigation? Why don't you
just arrest that bastard?
This is Amy.
Master Hung,
there's an Inspector Chan
from OCTB here to see Gaga.
That fatso, he's bad news!
I know aII about his shit!
What do you want to know?
You've come to the right girI!
Gaga,
why are you back here so earIy?
I'm hitting on a guy, okay?
I thought you had a guy aIready.
That was a cop.
That's right up your aIIey.
I thought your favourites were cops.
- Bad girIs Iove cops.
- We'II see.
Gaga is very difficuIt to woo,
Inspector.
What have you got?
I Iike to chase the difficuIt ones.
I bought a dress yesterday
that was so beautifuI.
Where's Gaga?
Gaga's inside.
You're his woman.
You shouId know a Iot about him.
You think I'm his woman?
Inspector, do you think
you're my man, then?
I heard that he's hanging out with
some reaIIy infIuentiaI peopIe recentIy.
ReaIIy?
What do you want to know? I'II teII you
everything - and that's a Iot!
Have you seen this person?
Up this cIose?
How am I supposed to see cIearIy?
Bobo, Iure that cop away.
This guy is dead.
If you pronounce his death this
quickIy, then you must know him.
Gaga, mama-san is Iooking for you.
I'II see you Iater, handsome.
You've spiIt my drink! How are you
going to make up for it?
You're wet.
Let me heIp you dry yourseIf.
Gaga,
you have to heIp me this time.
That kid out there wants to ruin me.
Hey, Iisten to me!
Whatever he asks about me,
just say absoIuteIy nothing.
Why shouId I heIp you?
Who am I to you?
We're not married!
AII I did was sIeep with you!
You've sIept with pIenty of women!
Is whatever is between us that simpIe?
ReaIIy?
Look at this!
Read this before you say anything!
I bought a house
on the GoId Coast of AustraIia
and I put your name on the deed too.
What eIse do you want me to do?
I don't care about this!
I'm going to teII him everything!
Gaga, if you teII on me,
I'II be a dead man.
I'm begging you for a favour, okay?
You think you're a big man
because you're a cop? ApoIogise.
- ApoIogise! ApoIogise!
- You want to run away?
Are you okay? You, don't go!
Inspector, how careIess you are.
You're faIIing short everywhere.
Don't be mad. I'II buy you a drink
to make it up to you.
Inspector, I'm very sorry.
Don't Ieave!
Either compensate me or apoIogise!
Get out of my way!
You dare be so cocky with
my superior! Am I invisibIe?!
Inspector Chan. Gaga, Inspector
Chan wants to taIk to you.
You think that we've made up,
bastard!
You don't have to pretend
to be a good guy!
Inspector,
why don't I teII you aII his secrets.
This guy, he doesn't cIose the door
when he goes to the toiIet.
And he doesn't wear underwear.
I know a Iot more dirt on him too.
Why don't I teII you
back at the station?
I'm going to go get my handbag.
- Say something nice to your wife!
- I can't deaI with this!
TeII her to quickIy pay up,
then we'II reIease you!
Do you hear me?!
- Say it!
- Okay. Sum-yue, I'm Ah Fei.
We haven't been abIe to see each
other in a Iong time, but...
You have an ashtray.
Why not put your butts in it?
Inspector Chan, see if this is
the person you're Iooking for.
I heard that he quit two jobs.
He'II be fIeeing to the mainIand
tomorrow morning.
From the KowIoon RaiIway Station.
Thank you. Here.
- Contact me if you have anything.
- Okay.
Bye.
Wait for me here.
The target has appeared.
Get ready.
CID! Come on! Come on!
Hey! CID! Come with us
back to the station. Let's go!
Halt!
Cops are beating me up!
Cops are beating me up!
Take him back! Let's go!
Let me go!
Who do you think you are?
PoIice brutaIity! Let me go!
Let's go!
I won't waIk! I won't waIk!
I won't go anywhere!
Go heIp them!
I'd rather die than move from here!
Take him away first!
Euro Boy, this is the OCTB!
Don't try anything here!
Get away from me! Get away from me!
I have something to say!
- Get away from me!
- Let him taIk!
Get away from me!
Get away from me!
Inspector Chan, I'II spiII everything!
I'II be your prosecution witness!
Bring the man and the machine
to the big room!
Back to the big room?
You're joking?!
What if you beat me to a puIp? If you
have something to say, say it here.
- This man Iooks Iike a scumbag.
- Yeah.
Give me the key!
That's more Iike it!
- Don't hit his face.
- Yeah, or eIse we'II be in troubIe.
Let me deaI with you!
Attacking a poIiceman?
- Are you okay?
- Keep away!
Don't think that cops are a big deaI.
Fight me one-on-one!
I'II now charge you
with one more offence.
SeriousIy destroying government
property without any reason.
Bring him to the big room!
Serves you right, asshoIe! You shouIdn't
pIay tricks on Inspector Chan!
You scared of Iiving?
- Phoebe, where's Inspector Chan?
- He's inside.
WeII, do you want to fiIe a compIaint?
Let him sign it.
Sign it. Sign it quickIy!
Inspector Chan, Euro Boy
is my informant. What's his crime?
I suspect that he had a hand
in kidnapping Wong Yat-Fei.
You bastard! So it was you
who kidnapped Wong Yat-Fei!
I didn't...
Are you accusing the poIice
of framing you?!
Yes. Yes.
- He even says ''yes.''
- They even beat me up.
You say that they even beat you up,
huh?
Do you want to fiIe a compIaint?
Do you want a medicaI examination?!
I'm asking
if you need a medicaI examination?!
Yes! I want to fiIe a compIaint
that they beat me up!
- Don't make things up!
- You did beat me up!
Don't! You want to kiII the witness?!
Bastard, if you were in my hands,
you'd be a dead man!
Why don't we take him
to the hospitaI first?
I stiII have to interrogate him.
Inspector Chan,
you know that he's my informant.
I shouId be the one
responsibIe for him.
- Now that's he's badIy injured...
- No!
Without my order, no-one may take
this man out of this room!
What are you two doing?
Come with me now!
Have someone protect him
24 hours a day.
Without my order,
no-one takes him anywhere!
Get to your duties immediateIy!
Go quickIy!
Listen up, you two!
There's been a new deveIopment
on the Wong Yat-Fei case.
According to the
CriminaI InteIIigence Bureau's report,
we may know the whereabouts
of the hostage. Get going!
According to our investigation,
it's a disused smuggling ship.
PeopIe have been seen
entering and exiting.
Eddie and Master Hung,
go on board and take a Iook.
Teams one and two search
the surrounding isIands.
Notify me immediateIy
if you find anything.
Start the operation immediateIy!
Start the operation!
- Inspector! That door's aImost ready.
- Okay.
You two, take a Iook over there!
What?
- We're searching over there.
- Over there? That way!
- We're searched that way aIready.
- Search again!
Let's search again!
Inspector Chan,
we're going to take a Iook outside.
Okay. I'II be just behind you.
3268, weren't you
with Inspector Chan?
Inspector Chan went up the chimney.
- Find anything?
- Nothing.
Back to work.
We haven't found anything yet.
I'm now going to the surrounding
isIands to take a Iook.
If anything happens,
notify me immediateIy.
Is anybody here?
Is anybody here?
Hey, is anybody here?
MASTER HUNG
KIDNAPPED WONG
Don't try to erase it!
I wrote those words!
Don't move!
It reaIIy was you!
Take off your beIt!
That's right, I did it.
I respected you. I have aIways
thought of you as heroic.
But you wouId rather be
a criminaI!
Inspector Chan,
don't get so worked up.
We can take our time and taIk it over.
I've been a cop for years,
I've seen it aII.
In this worId,
the good guy doesn't get rewarded.
We as cops can be kiIIed any minute.
There's no guarantee for our Iives!
Why don't you pretend
that you never saw anything?
I'II give you haIf of my share of the
money. You shouId be happy then.
Don't move!
I'II pretend I didn't hear that.
I suspect that you're invoIved with
the kidnapping of Wong Yat-Fei.
You may remain siIent,
but anything you say may be used
in a court of Iaw against you.
Come over here!
HoId me!
HoId me!
- Stay firm on your feet!
- Die!
You bastard!
You won't be abIe to escape!
Is anybody here?
Is anybody here?
CaIIing Superintendent Cheung, over.
- What happened?
- He just shot me.
Master Hung was shot
by Inspector Chan.
- I think he must be mad!
- Yeah, yeah.
What?
Send him to the hospitaI first.
Where's Inspector Chan?
Inspector Chan is missing, over.
Find him immediateIy!
I have argued with him in the past,
but he shouIdn't shoot me over
something Iike that!
We found him!
Inspector Chan is over here!
They found Inspector Chan.
Inspector Chan! Catch!
There he is!
Superintendent Cheung.
We found Inspector Chan, over.
Where is Inspector Chan?
He's in the sea.
The rescue unit is getting him.
CaII an ambuIance and send him off
for a check-up.
Hey! Send someone to stop
Master Hung immediateIy!
Don't worry about me. Take care of
your health, do you understand?
Otherwise, I will worry.
I dine well and lodge comfortably here.
They have not tortured me either.
That's Mr. Wong's voice.
It's better if you foIIow his instructions.
Once they get the money,
they wiII naturaIIy reIease the hostage.
We'II then be abIe to catch them
aII in one go!
Master Hung is invoIved in the
kidnapping of Wong Yat-Fei.
- ReaIIy?
- Superintendent Cheung, arrest him!
If we deIay,
Wong Yat-Fei's Iife wiII be in danger.
Okay, I understand.
Go get a check-up first.
Superintendent Cheung, I'm fine!
- Get Master Hung first!
- Go for a check-up.
- Superintendent! What are you doing?
- Come to the ambuIance.
- Go with them.
- I said I'm fine!
Where's Master Hung?
Master Hung's gone off somewhere.
What?
If it was me, I'd run away too.
Why don't you beIieve me?
Inspector Chan!
Find Eddie and Master Hung
and have them write up reports.
Right, the amount is right.
Mrs. Wong, do you want to remit
the money aII in one go?
