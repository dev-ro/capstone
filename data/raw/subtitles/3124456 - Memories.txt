After three years...
It's not fair, to make a pregnant
women carry the weight Iike this.
But, didn't see the fatigue
of the pregnant Iady...
...during the time of shopping.
What is this shopping? On seeing
the shopping of some wives, wiII reaIIy...
...feeI covetousness!
My Jansy madam, to shop Iike
this, I'm not a IT professionaI.
OnIy an ordinary Customs
empIoyee, receiving five figured saIary.
Whatever one says, Aravind has
got a kind of 'speaking about...
...poverty' tone.
Your friend, Shareef's wife, Pravin
goes for shopping to Bombay.
Why are you, not saying anything?
After three days...
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
The peopIe who had done this,
might have struggIed, a IittIe bit.
Have used a big rope sir.
So what?
No, that sir, one person
aIone can do that.
Don't teII fooIish things! One person
aIone.. That too, at this height!
If the body is made to Iay down,
maybe with a Iong rope, puIIed up!
Sir, move, move back!
Sir, matching with the missing case
that was reported three days ago.
The name of the victim is
Aravindan, he is a government servant.
Been one and a haIf years
since the marriage is over.
Just Iook at this, it is has been
approximateIy 15 hours...
...after the event of murder.
Now the time is 3o'cIock.
It can be one or two,
hours to that or this side.
By draining out the bIood.
There are no fractures or
bruises found in the body.
Then the onIy Ieft are
those wounds on the chest.
That is what, that is confusing me,
I can't understand that aIso.
To me it figures Iike just the wounds.
The bIood was drained
through those wounds.
If it were to kiII a person,
by draining out the bIood...
...then why not cut his veins!
Of course, then the death might
have occurred bit earIier. Here...
...there is a deIiberate attempt
to procrastinate the death.
Do you know, if anyone has got
enmity towards your husband?
Don't know sir.
Aravindan's nature was
not to win the hatred of anyone.
He was a very good boy.
Mister Krishna PiIIa, was Jansy
not interested on this marriage?
No, there is nothing Iike that.
Sir, she is totaIIy worried!
in a situation Iike this.
Something Iike, kind
of an 'obscurity'.
Hey man! There nothing, that sort
of an obscurity that girI's father.
Had come there.
Before the marriage, that girI
had an affair with a MusIim boy.
NaturaIIy, the parents refused it
at that time, this Aravindan...
...approached Krishna PiIIa.
Aravindan was ready to accept
Jansy after knowing everything.
They have conducted that marriage
without considering the Jansy's disIike.
Just because of that, their
marriage Iife was not that smooth.
Any information
about that MusIim boy?
They have given the
address of that boy.
Do they suspect that boy?
When the daughter's husband
is kiIIed, naturaIIy the Iover...
...wiII be doubted, is it not?
Sir, I doubt their intention is that for
instance, if this murder has happened...
...with the knowIedge
of the daughter.
The responsibiIity of this, can be
buIIied on the head of the boy...
...can it not be an attempt
to save the daughter?
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
AIi Ummer is it not?
Sir, is it true that the murderers
of Aravindan are caught?
- Yes.
Who is he? What is his name?
There is no chance
to teII aII that now.
Sir, why is that a suspense required?
Not a suspense, now nothing
of that sort is teIIing, that is aII.
Sir, that one..
Why is that sir, afraid ofjournaIist?
Who toId it is fear on the contrary
Iove so much! The journaIists!
No that sir, poIice used to react Iike
this, when the cuIprits, who are caught.
And when they are not sure of it.
Just asked, because of that.
Oh! is that so, here there
is no probIem Iike that.
The accused has aIready
accepted the crime.
The detaiIs of the accused wiII be
handed over to Varsha by me...
...before anyone eIse.
Why? Is that enough!
Do you know the name
of my new feature?
'AIcohoI and poIice'
Thinking to change that name.
'Women, wine and then the poIice'
Vijay, did you Iike the movie?
What kind of a rubbish movie was
it? In the name of comedy, some...
...substandard performances.
Oh! I didn't feeI Iike
much of a probIem in that.
Too bad!
Doesn't Vijay Iike?
I Iike aII kinds of movies.
But the movie must entertain me.
How is that possibIe?
The siIIy ones Iike you beIieve...
...that the comedy ones are
the onIy entertainments.
Who has opened this gate?
Lucky, no need to get down for
opening the gate, that's the reIief
Geeta, I'II cIose the gate and come.
Daddy, I'II aIso come.
SIowIy!
Are you taking the chiId?
A company forthe daddy.
Is it not, sweet one?
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
Don't try to scare me!
ChiId!
What is it?
Sir, biII!
Hey man, how much is this?
1,300!
Give one more fuII and
you keep the baIance.
Sir, if you drink Iike this.
Hey smug! Are you waIking
in the middIe of the road?
ReaIIy drunk isn't it?
So you are a mobiIe bar, aren't you?
Hey man! Why are you staring?
When you drink, behave properIy.
Don't create troubIe for us!
Hey! Where are you going? Find a
soIution forthis and then you go.
Hey, feIIow after drinking
creating scuffIe!
He is a poIice officer!
Take the vehicIe fast.
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
My heaven! What happened
my son? BIood is pouring...
...did you faII somewhere?
TeII, whatever it is.
Haven't I toId? Nothing is there
Iet mejust Iay down.
Son! I'II put some medicines.
- No need.
How is it?
Whose is this?
Mine! I soId that bike.
From, where did you get the money?
Took the Ioan!
Then the Ioan which you
took for the business.
How wiII you repay everything?
I wiII repay aII that.
Sanju, your Ioose hand on
money, it is not heading for good!
Anybody can take the Ioan, but
the skiII is in repaying that.
Then write my share and give it to
me, then nothing of this sort is required.
Now, onIy that is
awaiting to take pIace!
When you secured
a seat for medicine...
...your brother had taken a
Ioan for your education.
When you discontinued your
education in the haIf way.
Do you know how much your
brother struggIed to repay that Ioan?
Can give the share
after deducting that.
When you were 2 years
oId your father had died.
From there on, your
brother had given you Iove...
...as a father and as a brother.
On a brother, who had brought you up...
...are you on his name
fumbIing with accounts?
What mother had toId now
isn't that not an account?
That is the account of Iove!
What I'm teIIing is the
accounts of cash!
For the remaining years, everyone
wiII start saying the accounts and aII.
I have to take care
of my Iife aIso, haven't I?
I wiII teII you point bIank, I Iike a girI
on knowing, aII this business,
And property in possession, there
wiII not be any dispute from their side.
They are financiaIIy very affIuent.
With the dowry, they give that is
enough for me to repay aII this Ioans.
Are you not ashamed of saying?
WiII repay aII the Ioans
with the bride's money!
Why shouId I be ashamed of?. I'm
taking my wife's money is it not?
Even other wise, there is no
disgrace in this, rather than saying,
I'm the brother of
drunkard Sam AIex!
Sanju!
What is wrong in what I said?
Yesterday, after drinking
created a scuffIe in that cIub.
AII through out my chiIdhood,
mother used to say Iearn from...
...the eIder brother. Is it not?
What is that you are saying? That
I shouId Iearn..This drinking!
Whatever I do that is wrong, for
aII the mistakes, the eIder brother...
...does, mother has
got some excuses.
I waIked off from here,
because of this distinction!
Mother!
Son, didn't you hearthis?
I showed distinction.
Hey feIIow! What you
said is true, you have a Iife!
That must not be spoiIed
because of me.
Make aII the papers, that
are required for the share.
Son!
- Mother, do not deny!
He has got the age and caIiberfor
aII that. He wiII be smarter than me!
Look our routine
opening customer is here.
This man's..What kind
of drinking is this?
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
Looks Iike he has come
he respects father a Iot...
...if father advises him.
I can't bearthis, on seeing
this ruining by drinking.
Can you treat him on
taking to father's hospitaI?
Marrykutty, there is no use of
treatment without the...
...co-operation of the patient.
Now itseIf, there are 32 patients
in my de-addiction center.
But, aII of them have come with a
desire to outIive the aIcohoIism.
Son...
- FatherJohn.
In your Iife, things that have
happened are beyond the Iimits...
...of an average man.
That is over, afterforgetting aII that,
god had given the strength to...
...tide over in Iife.
Each men are given certain
responsibiIities and duties.
That must not be denied!
No, father not denying
but I've a doubt.
What was the duty and responsibiIity
of my wife and the chiId?
If it were to take back, why was
that my daughter given to me?
Father why was I made
covetous? Your god is crueI!
Sam, we do not possess any rights
to question the justice of god.
Good! This is the
victory of you cIergy men!
For everything and anything
there is an answer!
If shown a true man struggIing
in poverty and drudgery...
...then you'II say the the path to
heaven is narrow and is fuII of...
...stones and thrones!
When on showing the murderer and
the robber Iiving in aII the Iuxuries.
There is aIso an answer forthat.
The crueI god wiII nourish Iike pine.
If this is the justice of your god, then
I don't beIieve in that god, father.
For the time being, when the
sorrows grow beyond controI...
...he is the one who gives
A IittIe reIief, he is my god!
What is Iost for me, if one, at
Ieast anyone thing, if your god...
...can return me that.
On that day, I'II obey you father.
TiII then father Ieave me aIone.
Forgive me father, just because
of me, simpIy father..
Marrykutty, don't think Iike that,
I can understand why he is...
...taIking Iike this.
AII my caIcuIations have
never gone wrong tiII now.
He wiII come to me
with his own wiII!
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
This is a very thinIy popuIated area
no strangers were found by the...
...poIice in a suspicious manner.
On the 'prim a-facie' it is
an evident case of a murder.
As soon as possibIe
prepare the inquest...
...and send the body for postmortem.
Since, it is a simiIar case
the one who did the postmortem...
...for the previous case. He must do
the postmortem for this case aIso.
I'm going to the IG office, say
some thing and disperse the media.
The cause of death.
Died on account of
draining the bIood.
OnIy through this wound wiII
this much bIood get drained off?.
Before that bIood wiII get cIotted?
It may not be necessary, it
depends on the depth of the wound.
But, if the bIood gets cIotted aIso,
once the wound gets a shake...
...or some thing, again
it wiII start to bIeed.
As a person is intentionaIIy torturing
he wiII never give time to...
...get the bIood cIot.
It is noticed here, on the existing
wounds, by increasing the depth...
...of the wounds,
The bIeeding is sustained here.
So, in this case aIso!
I've checked the background
of men who are dead.
They do not have
any kind of contacts.
Even the pIace, where they
have studied are different.
There are onIy two simiIarities,
their age and profession.
Both are customs professionaIs.
On saying, a seriaI kiIIer, generaIIy
there wiII be some connection...
...between the victims.
That is not necessary.
May be if it is a random seIection,
this ripper case and aII was Iike that.
Then the simiIarities
what Vinod had toId...
...can it not be the
connections between them?
The age, I'm not taking in to
consideration, but profession...
...who are sincere. Two customs
officers who are sincere...
...naturaIIy won't be Iacking enemies.
Maybe, the enemies Iike
that are behind this murders.
May be creating a smoke screen to
avoid the poIice investigation...
...against them underthe
pretext of a seriaI kiIIer
Sir are you coming to say that
again there wiII not be victims?
Cannot categoricaIIy say that
again there can be. If...
...that is aIso a customs officer.
If not?
Not that sir, just hinted that, I'm
behind the enemies of the...
...young men who are dead.
Before the media bIows this up!
Must reach to a concIusion.
As sir says..
For the journaIists..
After whacking a innocent person
you were very anxious to report it to...
...the media.
Look, they are waiting out side.
Since the two kiIIings have taken
pIace in an identicaI manner...
...can't say that the cuIprit is the same
person. Forthat must need concrete...
...evidences.
With what evidences have
you arrested AIi Ummer?
In the evening news?
What aII is he saying?
If he can't do that.
I'II teII.
Driver stop the car. Stop it man!

You have not toId anything...
...priorto this, I've approached
you with the same demand.
At that time..
I've to say what I toId at
that time, sir, I can't do it.
I know you are seeing
me not as a senior officer...
...on the contrary as a 'God father'
TeIIing on that freedom, you
mustn't ruin Iike this by drinking.
No father, no husband can bearthe
disaster that had happened in your Iife.
But that is over.
I haven't done suicide, have I?
StiII Iiving. But how that shouId be
that is to be decided by me.
Anyone can advise, because
none of you have Iost anything.
The responsibiIity for my Ioss goes
to, incIuding you, it is your departments.
Do not forget that.
As the need arose, everyone
wants me, even other wise...
Coming to ones own
concern everybody is seIfish!
Son!
If you think that I've come
for my seIfish gains..
Sir, there is nothing wrong in asking.
But even if I try, I can't do it.
ShaII I take Ieave?
Sir, don't have any iII-feeIings.
No, never, I know Sam don't I?
I have given the pIace to
him as a eIder son of mine.
This time, I had a high
expectation. On the earIier visits...
...I was not that astonished.
Since he denied.
Because aII those cases were not
that chaIIenging, if Sam had...
...shown interest in this case.
The Iife from now on
might have changed a Iot.
My mind is teIIing Iike that.
TiII now, I've not insisted on him on
anything but forthis, I wiII just try.
UncIe, it has been quite Iong
since seen you.
Heard that, started some
new business and aII.
Somehow, managed a smaII one.
I must aIso survive, mustn't I?
Okay, fine I'm Ieaving.
Anyway Marrykutty, you give it a try.
Rest of the things in gods hands.
Pray, what eIse to do.
Okay, see you.
What is this?
Partition deed!
Have you read this?
I must aIso sign, mustn't I?
Yes, here.
I'II read and check, Iater wiII sign.
On signing this, it wiII
not become vaIid and aII.
On coming to register office and
sign onIy then, it wiII have vaIidity.
May be, but I must read!
Okay, that's enough. Good
if you don't deIay much...
Then, one more thing this...
...25th, it's my marriage fixation
Marriage fixation!
Yes, mother shouId come.
To come? Where to?
As per our customs, the
fixation shouId be conducted...
...at the bridegroom's house is it not?
Yes, that is not in this house.
This house is buiIt by brother,
in hard way, that's what mother...
...used to say, isn't it?
Though, on rent, I've a own house.
Mother shouId come
on the previous day itseIf.
Then what about your brother?.
OnIy mother shouId come!
Sanju! I'm not the one who shouId
fix the marriage, it is your brother...
...who is on behaIf of yourfather.
If it is without aIcohoI
brother can come.
On coming after having drinks,
sometimes this entire...
...marriage may get canceIIed.
Mother, they are aII
decentIy Iiving peopIe.
ChiId! You don't worry,...
...because of me, your marriage
wiII not be canceIIed.
Mother wiII come. - No, I'II not go a
pIace where you cannot come.
Shit! What kind of a
nuisance is this?
Mother, what he says is
aIso IogicaI. Mother must go.
No, don't compeI me!
I'II not go aIone!
OId Iady! Why can't you go?
He is aIso your son is it not?
WiII not give..Peace
of mind to Iive aIso!
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
Sam has never
quarreIed with you, mother?.
- No.
Had not toId anything
in a harsh manner?
So, that's it, onIy with me!
Mother, do you know what aII this
son of yours, caIIs me on getting angry?
Hey girI, that is the difference
between you and the mother.
Mother, wiII never give me a chance
to get angry. Is it not mother?
Grandmother, this mother is envious!
Hey girI, don't have hard feeIings!
Hungry, is it not? I'II set the rice.
Mother, pardon me!
When mother shows more
and more Iove towards me.
He wiII hate me, to a greater extend.
That is why, at that time
I toId Iike that.
It's aII right son, I understood that.
Son, shouId do a favor for me.
Tomorrow you must take
me to the church.
You don't come inside I must pray!
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
Son! I must taIk to you for
some time in front of them.
Your dad aIways used to say, you
had the maturity beyond your age.
I came to know that is true
after the death of father.
As on today, I've never
asked anything to you.
You had done everything
knowing the situation.
For the first and the Iast
time in front of them...
...I'm demanding a thing from you.
You must investigate the case
suggested by Menon sir.
Mother, it is not as you think.
OnIy a try, that is aII I request.
WiII not compeI you
you have got the freedom...
...to deny or accept this request of
mine. If possibIe, for mother...
...son shouId do that.
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
'The poor poIice administration'
Mr. Menon what is this?
A case that has become a
sensationaI one, are you handIing it...
...in a irresponsibIe way?
A guy, who is on Ieave and roaming
on drinks handing overthe...
...case to him!
Sam AIex once upon a time
he was one of the smartest...
...cop in the department.
For his present situation to some
extend our department is...
...aIso responsibIe forthat.
This repentance and sentiments!
Mr. Menon, there is no significance
on who this, Sam AIex was before.
Mr. Menon are you sure that
wiII get 100% efficiency from him.
See, even Mr. Menon, is not sure.
I was more shocked since
you aIso supported that!
Sir, Menon has got no pIans to
change the existing officers...
...either, incorporate Sam to this team.
Or eIse, Sam's...
unofficiaI paraIIeI inquiry.
But in this newspaper
it is not written Iike that.
It is written as the present
investigating officer...
...is changed, and then
the Sam is appointed.
Don't know sir.
Mr. Menon, the
government appreciates...
...your approach to the
work, but media.
That is not going to effect you
aIone, wiII effect the entire government.
Whoever, however they en-quire.
A performance that wiII
out smart a miIitary operation.
Appreciation from the
'centraI home department'
On that encounter, one of the dead
terrorist's brother had escaped.
We were aIso expecting a
retaIiation. Because of that...
...we never informed outside
Who was behind
that risky operation.
After one month
IB's report had come,
There is a chance of an
attack on Sam and famiIy.
We gave aII kinds of protection.
For a period of one year, it went
on without any probIems.
On account of that, seriousness
of the protection aIso decIined.
Sam's wife and the chiId in the
hands of that terrorist, who had escaped!
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
Nothing my chiId
dad is here, nothing!
Mr. Sam put the gun down!
Don't do anything on them!
You must feeI the pain when you
Iose the peopIe whom you Iove.
That is the punishment for you.
He had witnessed a sight that no
father or husband shouId have...
...seen in the worId.
For anyone who had understood
him, cannot bIame him for...
...his present situation.
Sir, I didn't know aII this stories.
You did yourjob as a journaIist but
who had given a mis-conception, to you?
That is what I want to know.
Don't teII, if it is uneasy for you.
Sir, there is nothing Iike that
S.P Vinod Krishna had given...
...this information to me.
I doubted, S.P caIIed
and said, you had beIieved that.
CouIdn't you en-quire
what was the truth?
Sir, I'd en-quired, came to know
that Sam had started coming to office.
That is why, I..
Okay, happened is happened.
Don't harm him! If he
couId bring a tip forthis case.
I'm Varsha Mathews, I'm a journaIist.
So what?
I wanted to taIk. If you don't mind.
ReaIIy do mind!
Pardon, onIy two minutes are
required. Can I sit here?
This is not my famiIy owned property!
I was the one in the newspaper..
Thanks, I was just thinking how to
get rid off this case investigation.
Sam, must investigate that!

That Iad had started from the house
yesterday, stiII now not returned.
Today morning, a bike was Iying

...the IocaI station.
That was how, came to know this
bike beIonged to the missing Iad.
We have checked aII the
hospitaIs in this vicinity.
But had not received any report
as admitting an accident case Iike this.
Suresh!
Sir!
What is it sir?
Must take the measurements
of the both boot print.
Why is that for?
This boot print is that of the kiIIer,
whom we are Iooking for.
There are Iot of boot prints here
Iike this. How to identify...
...this is kiIIer's?
This is 'boot print' in a viIIage Iike
this, there wiII be very few...
...who uses a boot Iike this.
SimiIarIy, this boot has gone to
the area of the canaI and aIso...
...had come back.
On the return 'the print' has
Ieft a 'deeper impression'
That means the person who had
gone, on return the Ioad has increased!
May be...

These Ietters, have
seen somewhere.
Father, I want to know, what
is written orthese Ietters...
...or whatever that is written
Are they reIated to
Christianity in anyway?
Or is it connected to crucifixion
of Christ in any way?
May be, why not, this be a very oId
Ianguage? For exampIe Roman or Latin!
Something Iike that?
I know Roman and Latin, Sam you
do one thing, give a copy of this to me.
There are Iot of books at the Bishop
house to refer about the...
...'ancient Ianguages'
I'II just check and teII you.
Father, you keep this, I have
got copies of this with me.
But father..
- Yes.
Want this immediateIy.
I'II go tomorrow itseIf.
Father.
- Yes.
Which is this painting?
'The sermon of Jesus at the mount'
In which Ianguage did Jesus speak?
'Aramaic'
Sam!
I just had a nap!
Mr. Sam, this is not a Iiquor shop!
I cannot investigate this
case by quitting my habits.
Sir, in this case tiII now, there
are three victims. In that, we...
...have confirmed that two are dead.
Now, what is remaining
is..That..One who was...
...kidnapped two days back.
Yea, young man named Ramesh!
If my doubt is correct
tomorrow morning, from any...
...part of KeraIa, we'II get his body.
To say this, have you caIIed us at
night? AII this any cop wiII know this.
First two young men where
kidnapped, third day their...
...body was found.
If it is an abnormaI seriaI kiIIer
definiteIy, he'II foIIow this...
...pattern for sure.
Don't worry, I'm at the IG office.
Son wiII you not come for food?
Mother you have food
and sIeep. I'II reach Iate.
Okay.
What do you feeI
seeing these photos?
Both men are simiIarIy..
Anything, apart from that?
Now?
In this case, there are certain
simiIarities with the death of...
...Christ on the cross.
An arithmetic of three days.
When the Christ was
crucified, on the third day...
...had Iiberated.
Here the victims are kidnapped
on Friday, after three days...
...that means on Sunday.
Their body was found! Not
compIeted, the next simiIarity is...
...the most important
turning point in this case.
For what did Christ die?
Forthe sin of others.
This kiIIer's vengeance is not
on the young men who are dead.
Then?
To their wives!
If the grudge is on the wives, then
they are the ones to be kiIIed is it not?
Forthat, doubt of yours
I'm the Iiving answer!
On the enmity towards me, why
was that my wife and chiId..
Is that not the biggest punishment?
The reason to think that the wives
are the target of the kiIIer..This...
...is the one.
These are not mereIy the marks of
wound to drain out the bIood.
These are Aramaic Ietters
Ianguage spoken by Jesus Christ.
Out of this, what was seen
on the first body..Is this one.
The transIation of
this is 'Proverb 5:3'
Which means, according to good
saying in BibIe on these aphorism...
...5th chapter, 3rd saying.
I'II read that.
''For the Iips of the aduIterous
women drip honey and her speech...
...is smootherthan oiI; but in the
end she is bitter as gaII, sharp...
...as a doubIe-edged sword''
The second one is Job 39; book
of Job; chapter 30, maxim 9.
''And now am I their song, yea, I am
their by word, they abhor me...
...they fIee far from me''
The first one denotes the hatred the
kiIIer is having towards the women.
The second one, denotes the
reIationship, maybe the kiIIer...
...had with the wives
of the deceased.
If this is true, with those femaIes
we can reach to the kiIIer.
In our state the night patroIIing
shouId be made strong...
...especiaIIy, today night!
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
Hey mister!
Where?
Over there sir.
That drunkard! Has he
not reached so Iong?
No sir, have send the vehicIe.
Not seen any one, seems Iike
they are coming to know.
Who has seen the body first?
It's P.C Somashekkaran sir.
CaII him.
Sir.
He was foIIowing the wife of the
offender, who was absconding...
...after paroIe.
Who had taken you aII in poIice?
ShouId have foIIowed him.
Must have informed us immediateIy.
Not that sir, has identified who
he is, after seeing the body.
After coming back
he had aIready Ieft.
Then what? WiII he wait
for you, over there?
Hey man! Can you recognize him on
seeing? Do you remember his face?
No sir, it was reaIIy dark.
Then he had something Iike a
bIack coat or something.
I'm here at the spot, haIf an hour
back sir, don't know sir...
...right from morning,
after taking aIcohoI..
Where have you seen the vehicIe?
Over to that side sir.
No, sir no journaIists are there.
Here the formaIities are aImost...
...going to get over.
WiII, come sir.
What, is it sir?
I'II go to IG office and come.
Over here sir.
Can you teII, which type
of the vehicIe was it?
Sir, that is...
Just try to recoIIect.
Sir, think it is a kind ofjeep! At the
back side, it was not canvas...
...but the body was buiIt.
What was the coIor of the vehicIe?
Sir, that is, since it was dark.
For how many cases have
I heIped you beyond the Iimits?
Why was that for?.
Sam may be an aIcohoIic.
Sir, there is no surety that
his findings are true isn't it?
To prove that, it is wrong, we
must have the facts and figures...
...contradicting that.
With this un-necessary ego and
professionaI jeaIousy, don't spoiI...
...the future of yours and this case.
What I had toId is not on account
of ego or professionaI jeaIousy.
For a poIice officer, there are
some code of conduct, is it not?
GeneraIIy, how to behave..
That, you don't teach me.
What you say, this code of
conduct how many poIice officers...
...are there in our department
who foIIows this 100%%% .
I know the poIice officers who whiIe
on duty time goes for boozing...
...and womanizing.
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
Sit down.
As per what Sam has requested,
one of the wives of the...
...deceased young men had come.
The second one is on the way, and
the young man who was kiIIed...
...today his wife must be omitted,
Is it not? In a situation Iike this.
Of course.
Sir, the marking which was on the
body that was found today...
...and the BibIe quotes
denoted on that.
Aphorism, chapter 6, 33rd saying.
''He wiII receive the bruises and
iII-fame, never can be expunged...
...why because, thejeaIousy''
''Makes the man hot tempered, wiII
not show mercy when he is...
...doing vengeance, wiII never''
''Accept the prizes, never wiII a
bigger prizes make him happy''
Sirthe things are becoming cIearer
first it was hatred to Iadies.
Second one denoted, the
personaI reIationship with them.
Now this is the thirst
for the vengeance.
So, we can deny the
possibiIity of random seIection.
AImost 6 feet in height, 70-75 kg
weight, his right Ieg is sIightIy shorter.
Sam, how did you know aII this?
LastIy, from the both crime scenes
had received two boot prints.
On that, the right Ieg print, compared
to the Ieft, has Ieft a deeper...
...impression of 0.25 inches.
When men waIking, with one of
the Ieg shorter in Iength, more...
...pressure wiII be exerted on that Ieg.
NaturaIIy, that foot print wiII be
submerged more deepIy...
...simiIarIy he has used a speciaIIy
designed shoes to...
...adjust this Iength difference.
From the Tyre tracks what we've
received, that is a Gypsy's baIIoon...
...radiaIs, that is being understood.
The coIor of the vehicIe was
red, from the the scrapping of...
...paint received from the crash guard
of the Iast Iast victims bike proves that.
From the statement of
PC Somashekkaran, it was cIear...
...that it was a red hard top gypsy.
TeII, to wait.
The second Iady has aIso come.
They know each other is it not?
How did you know that?
From where have you
both known each other?
Sir at an entrance coaching center.
Where?
At an organization at
AngamaIy named 'Career Top'
From 2004 June onwards for a
crash course of 6 months.
Do you know this girI?
This is VimaIa Menon.
No, VimaIa Ramesh.
Both are the same person.
Ramesh is the husband of this girI.
Ramesh was aIso kiIIed in the
same manner how both of...
...your husbands were kiIIed.
If not, you might be having an
enemy. Is there any one Iike that?
Sir, we don't have
any enemies Iike that.
As you think there may not be
any soIid reason for this enmity.
The enemy of yours is
not a normaI person.
Something Iike a Iimb in waIking!
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
The owners of 'Career Top' were
coupIes, Issac and Parvathy.
They were haiIing from the some
remote viIIage in the southern KeraIa
After a sensationaI inter-caste
marriage, eIoping from the...
...native pIace, taIking a Iot...
Students in the institute were
teIIing of stories about them.
Their high Iight was the quaIity
of teaching, because of it...
...that coaching center
deveIoped aII of a sudden.
For madam's assistance, a young
man named Anand had come there.
Anand was adopted by
the parents of the madam.
So caIIed Anand was he a Iame?
Yes, one of the Anand's
Ieg was short in Iength.
Anand was a speciaI character
never used to taIk much to others.
AIways in the Iand of books,
Ioved to read the BibIe the most.
From outside..
Some kind of indifference was there
in his behavior, smaII incidents...
...are enough to make Anand angry.
The way he express it...
...wiII reaIIy feeI scared.
Once Parvathy mam, aIso hosteI
warden of girIs unexpectedIy...
...came to our room.
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
We pIeaded with Parvathy madam
and Issac sir, so that this incident
...may not be informed to parents.
I have no other option
other than to inform parents.
Madam, it was a mistake on our
part, pIease pardon this time, madam.
We've some responsibiIities to the
parents who had send you aII here.
Since that is foIIowed correctIy, that
is why this institute had deveIoped...
...Iike this.
So you are bIocking me is it not?
There is no change in my decision
that this issue wiII be informed at house.
Move back!
What was the names of
other two students?
Lakshmi and Anitha.
Was your parents caIIed?
Sit.
Here, it is the book what
your chiIdren are reading!
Sir, they are not going to pass the
entrance onIy if we decide.
They must aIso work hard
and co-operate with us.
Sir, these ones are not coming here
to Iearn. These two, standing...
...are the gang Ieaders.
You just Iook at them. Aren't they
aged to get them married off?.
That is what they are
aIso interested on.
FeeIs sorry for this time
must pardon madam.
We'II see that such incidents
may not happen again.
Since sir has toId, we'II give
one more chance to them.
Is it not?
- Yes.
If anything Iike this happens
again we'II terminate them.
We were totaIIy ashamed
in front of our parents.
That incident was weII spread
through out the institute.
We were in a situation not
abIe to waIk 'head straight'.
EspeciaIIy comments from the boys.
WiII you give that? What a coIor!
Heard that there is a book and aII.
Get Iost you feIIows!
Give that, wiII give the books
what we have in exchange.
We became obstinate!
Somehow, feIt Iike taking
revenge on Parvathy madam.
Our next effort was to make
some kind of probIems in her Iife.
At that time, it came to our notice
that Anand was having...
...some kind of interest on VimaIa.
VimaIa, one minute wiII you come?
This has been happening severaI
times now. By caIIing VimaIa...
...aIone and taIking.
It seems that this disease
is that one.
Why can't we pIay with this guy?
VimaIa aIso behaved with Anand
as if she is aIso Ioving Anand.
Anand was under our controI
more rapidIy that we thought.
One day, Lakshmi and VimaIa
had gone and met Issac sir.
Sir, it is reaIIy a nuisance
Anand is aIways after VimaIa!
Sir mustn't caII and scoId. OnIy
can give advice, that is enough.
Sir, Anand shouIdn't know that we
are ones who came here and toId this.
On knowing this, Anand
had come to meet VimaIa.
I've not toId anything Iike that!
Issac sir is simpIy teIIing Iies!
VimaIa, at Ieast now, speak
out the matter to Anand!
What matter?
I'II teII.
Hey girI! No need! That
wiII turn out to a probIem.
You keep quite, Iet
Anand know the truth.
Anand, don't you know the
issue that happened in hosteI?
After that, the approach of Issac sir
towards us was entireIy changed.
EspeciaIIy towards VimaIa!
He is showing a fiIthy kind
of acquaintance.
Last day, caIIed VimaIa and
cautioned her, not to be so...
...cIose to Anand!
Anand, don't go
and create any scuffIe.
Fearing that I had not toId anything.
There is onIy one month Ieft to get
the course compIeted, tiII then...
...you both must not meet.
Afterthat, you can meet
outside, is it not? On that...
...Issac sir can't say anything.
Anand, bIindIy beIieved the story
what we toId, within the one month Ieft..
..we tactfuIIy deepened the gap
between the Anand and Issac sir!
Like wise, on the day of compIetion
of the course we empIoyed a pIan again!
Hey girI! Make it fast before
anyone sees, you go to Issac sir.
We wiII go to Anand.
Go!
Sir, did you see this? Anand
had got hoId of VimaIa!
Since we saw that, was
abIe to save her respect.
What is the security for
the girIs Iearning here?
Anand, she was..By, Issac sir..
Now onIy I came to know, both
of yours intention was this...
I don't want to see Anand again!
This kind of actions of
yours cannot be toIerated here!
Get Iost, didn't I say to go?
Leave, Ieave me!
Oh! My god, tutor..
Anand, what is this?
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
On the same day, we
returned to our homes.
Afterthat did you see Anand?
We saw. We came to know, that
Anand tried to meet VimaIa...
...severaI times.
VimaIa was reaIIy in tension.
We've decided that, it must be put
to an end! We informed Anand...
...that wiII meet at the center where
the entrance examination was heId.
Because of you and Issac sir, it
was VimaIa's Iife which got ruined.
She is in shock. She is not
even writing the entrance exam.
What quaIity do you have?
To Iove you.
Is it famiIy aristocracy? Or is it, this
beauty? Or is it, this Iamed Ieg?
Your Iife was ruined, not by us
but your sister and Issac sir...
...they had done it.
You go and ask them
Hey girI come!
After this incident, we had
not met Anand again.
Do you know where is
Lakshmi and Anitha now?
Don't know sir.
Can you give any kind of detaiIs
Iike the address or some thing...
...whiIe they were studying?
Since it was a crash course of 6
months our friendship was not that deep.
None of us couId pass the entrance
aIso. On account of that...
...we got separated to different...
...routes to study different courses.
Then we had no contacts at aII.
May be on checking with that
institute can get the address.
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
One soda!
Hey boy! Get one soda.
Look, you cannot booze here!
Not to booze in here, is that okay?
Where is that entrance
coaching center out here?
Career top?
Yes, that is the one, where is that?
That is next one over
there, but that is aII cIosed.
Why? What happened?
Afterthe death of owner Issac
sir, that was cIosed down.
For how Iong?
May be 8 to 9 years back.
His person, Issac how did he die?
Died after faIIing from the top of
institute, peopIe are saying...
...feII by sIipping.
What is his wife doing now?
That is the pathetic part, sir feII
and died in front of that Iady...
On seeing that, she became mad!
There was a Iad, aIong with them
brother, he went somewhere taking her.
Then after many years came back
and soId the buiIding and property...
...for a whooping big amount.
Now a working woman's
hosteI is functioning there.
Is there anyone here, who
were cIoseIy Iinked with them?
Just to know whether any
information can be obtained on them.
There is a Iady named VaIsamma
she was the servant in the house...
...of Issac sir.
After seIIing that property, that Iad
gave a sum of Rs. 3,00,000 to this Iady.
Because of that, poor Iady survived.
My god poIice, didn't I teII you
not to take aIcohoI here?
Where have they come?
That is my vehicIe!
Sir, are you, poIice?
Then shaII I take..
Something as snacks?
Where is this VaIsamma's house?
Sir, after going from here for
300 meters, as I toId before...
...that is this working woman's hosteI.
Just behind that, is so
caIIed this VaIsamma's house.
Just en-quire in that
hosteI, she is working there.
Hey VaIsamoo!
Coming, don't open
your mouth and scream!
Two peopIe have
come to meet you.
How coId is it? What a chiII!
Who are you? Have you come
here to give aIcohoI to him?
We're poIice!
What is it sir?
We wanted to know
certain things from VaIsamma.
Keep it! And you move
to that side for some time.
Certain things what we
want to know is with you.
What is it sir?
If you say that honestIy, we wiII
not meet again on the contrary.
If teIIing Iies, then we wiII have to
meet severaI times in severaI ways!
Sir, I'II teII the truth what is
it that, sir wants to know?
There is a big secret that is in
VaIsamma mind, that is not...
...known by the outside worId.
That is what we have to know.
I can't understand
what sir is intending.
For that secret, the amount
fixed by you was Rs. 3,00,000!
But for us it is more costIier that that.
Why did Anand kiII Issac?
No sir, Anand
had not kiIIed anyone.
VaIsamma, don't try to hide anything.
No sir, it is true! Anand
had not intentionaIIy kiIIed...
...that was an accidentaI death.
A mistake that happened without
knowIedge. I'm sure because...
I've seen with my very eyes!
8 to 9 years back, there were some
probIems between Anand and the girIs...
...who came to study here.
What was that girI's name?
I don't remember that sir.
Was it VimaIa?
Think something Iike that
I can't remember exactIy.
Where did Anand go?
Went in search of that
girI but seems couIdn't find her.
Why, what is the
reason to think Iike that?
After one month, that boy came
back, on that day there was again...
...a quarreI between the
chiId and Issac sir.
Hey you! Leave me!
You wiII break up me
and her, won't you?
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
Sister, I didn't do it intentionaIIy, it
happened Iike that don't say it...
...to anyone. Save me.
Did Anand come to know that,
aII the girIs had jointIy created...
...a miss-understanding?
Yes sir, I toId that.
He was not abIe to
conceive that suddenIy...
...the boy understood that sIowIy.
If you couId have known the truth,
why was that not toId before?
I was not sure but had strong
doubts. With that...
I didn't possess the
guts to say that to the boy.
Because, when he gets
angry, can't say what he wiII do!
Did this Anand have
any kind of mentaI probIems?
He was having a pecuIiar nature,
when he Iikes someone...
...wiII Iike very much.
When hated, doesn't
Iike to see them at aII.
Why did you hide aII
this things from the poIice?
On thinking about Parvathy, an
accidentaI mistake that occurred...
...if Anand goes to the jaiI.
Who is there for Parvathy?
Afterthat incident, heard that
Parvathy became Iunatic.
Sir, there is nothing Iike that, after
that incident Parvathy had...
...not spoken. After the death...
...of Issac sir, after one month one
day, Anand had taken...
...Parvathy and Ieft somewhere.
After 6 months, onIy Anand came
back and toId that aII this property...
...is soId and gave me a sum of three
Iakhs. Have burned aII the papers...
...that was in the house
and in the office.
Lot of papers were searched
and had taken and gone.
When Issac was dead,
was Parvathy, pregnant?
Yes, have got after waiting for 8
to 10 years, whiIe going from...
...here Parvathy was two months.
When Anand came back, I came
to know that Parvathy had...
...given birth to a girI chiId.
Do you know where they are now?
No sir, after giving the money to me
and going, I haven't seen them.
Any oId photos or address of
Anand and Parvathy anything Iike that?
No sir, I don't have anything with
me. TruIy sir, I don't have...
...anything with me sir.
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
Antony, where are you?
Daughter is not feeIing weII sir.
What happened?
Good temperature, now in the
hospitaI, knew the news on...
...caIIing the office.
Sir, what shaII we do next?
From where to start?
In aII the cases there wiII be some
Iinks or evidences, our success...
...is on finding that.
In this case..
Sir!
We didn't know
such a thing Iike this.
How is that possibIe?
On getting the kiIIer in a hands
reach, un-expectedIy and...
...couIdn't do anything.
If the journaIists come to know
this, wiII you peopIe remain idIe?
That wiII be made to a sensationaI
news saying it is the inefficiency...
...of the poIice.
That is what, which
had happened here.
Then one more thing
this news must appear...
...as if it is found out by Varsha.
Department wiII deny that a secret
move Iike this, is known to one...
...more person.
IG Aravindasha Menon.
But mustn't I specify that
who had found out this.
No, must not be there, this news
shouId not have a cIarity...
OnIy then the kiIIer
shouId feeI it as, it is credibIe.
Hot news, the mysterious kiIIer was
found by a poIice officer, brother...
...two rupees.
Hot news, the mysterious kiIIer
was found by a poIice officer.
Sir is there any truth, in saying
that the mysterious kiIIer was...
...found by a poIice officer?
Who toId? Neither me or my
department has known that.
Sir, but in the news paper?
Which newspaper? You
go and ask thatjournaIist.
Regarding the man missing case
of the young customs officers..
The actuaI kiIIer is seen by the
poIice officer, this is a turning...
...point in the investigation
by the poIice.

AIcohoIism is something that

Name is Nasar, wife's
name is Lakshmi!
They are staying in Theni,
there they have an estate.
He was missing three days back.
Found the body today morning.
From where?
- Peerumedu.
How did Sam know this?
It is not knowing that..
Sir, have you noticed one thing?
On the first kiIIings there was an...
...intervaI of 5 to 6 months.
Now it is reduced to 1 .5 months!
Must at Ieast save
the Iast young man.
Sir, why don't we
give this to the media?
With the evidences got so
far, and the Iadies identities.
As the 5th girI knows
this, wiII she approach us?
That is a matter that
can be thought of.
Must not sir, though we
do not know who the kiIIer is.
With the facts what we have in
hand if we give it outside, he wiII fIee!
But won't it heIp to find that girI?
OnIy if it heIps..
On that, we are not sure.
And if we find that,
what can we do?
How Iong?
As Iong as it demands.
Like how I and my famiIy
was protected, is it not?
From the VaIsamma's
statement it is cIear.
Why, did Anand come back? Was
the property saIe onIy his intention?
He wanted some of the documents
and the rest was aII destroyed.
The very identity of Anand was
expunged! May be he might...
...be Iiving in a new identity.
Those documents which
was taken by him, may be...
...it must be the informations
about those girIs.
Not may be, it is! At that time itseIf
he had pIaned severaI things.
What Sam says is aII correct...
...but again one more victim!
That mustn't be aIIowed!
Sir, have you seen this?
The 4th victim's body, the
pIace where it was found.
Sir, haven't you asked
how I found that?
From the pIace where the 1st body
was found, there is a difference...
...of 150 KiIometers.
From the pIace where the 2nd body
was found. From these two points.
Again there is a difference of 150
KiIometers, where the third body...
...was found.
So, if this kiIIer is foIIowing a pattern
Iike this, naturaIIy the fourth...
...body must be found here.
From the baIance three
points, onIy this pIace is there...
...moving further away
of 150 KiIometers.
What is happening on
our search for the gypsy, sir?
Have send the messages to
aII the poIice stations in KeraIa.
Now teII them, there is no need of
searching forAnand aII over KeraIa.
I know in which part
he wiII be Iocated.

Nothing more, in aII business
concerns that are reIated to a vehicIe.

Are you the manager here?
- Yes sir.
How many workers are here?
- 15.
As it is morning time, they

CaII aII of them.

Have you ever noticed a red gypsy
with baIIoon radiaIs with a hard body.
Either here or anywhere eIse.
Sir.
- Yes.
I've seen a vehicIe Iike that.
MGR.lollo@Tamiltorrents.net
ShouId not aIIow that boy to
communicate with anyone eIse, okay.
Inside sir.
Did that boy see that vehicIe here?
- No sir.
At the Kumarakom.
Before coming here, I was in a
petroI pump at Kumarakom.
That vehicIe had come there
severaI times forthe water service.
How Iong have you been here?
It has been one year.
What is the reason why you
stiII remember that vehicIe?
The tyre of that, has
got this much width..Sir.
Do you remember the
number of the vehicIe?
No sir.
Can you identify the person
who drove that vehicIe?
Yes, even Iast week
he had come here.
What is it sir?
You change the mud fIap of that
vehicIe. Drive in the vehicIe.
Come sir, we'II sit inside.
Where to?
To change the
mud fIap of that vehicIe.
Brother Johny, Iast week a person
came here to change the mud...
...fIap of that swift, is it not?
Sir is asking about him.
I remember that, think it
is on Iast Monday.
Have you noticed
the vehicIe number?
- No sir.
I didn't go out, he had come inside,
changed the mud fIap and...
...Ieft immediateIy.
Who had changed the mud fIap?
- Ratheesh.
Is Ratheesh required to be caIIed?
I'II caII him.
Ratheesh.
- Yes.
Come here.
Does anyone of you rememberthat
the person who came in that swift car?
Does he have
any kind of pecuIiarity?
For exampIe, something Iike
a Iimping or something.
It is for a case...
...we must require the detaiIs on
that person at any cost. We...
HeIIo, mother.
When I caIIed father
John came to know that...
...you stopped in
