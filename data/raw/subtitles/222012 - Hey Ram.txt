(Ananthu -Boundless)
Leaving everything here
Where are you going?
Wherever you go
With your friends and
The stories they spin
Wish you all the happiness!
Ceased Boundless!
Good Morning, Doctor.
-Good Morning
Hi Ram,
Hi, Munnu
Day break already?
One can't make out whether
it's morning or evening.
Why don't you turn on the light
to cheer up the spirit?
l need to switch the lights on
to check the report.
Switch on the light if you must.
Grandpa prefers the darkness.
l don't remember seeing Grandpa's
face in bright light.
l have always seen him in darkness.
So strange, l have heard that
Mahatma Gandhi sleeps with lights on.
He hates darkness.
-Grandpa prefers darkness.
Maybe he's no Mahatma (great soul)
Just your good average atma (soul)
ls it not enough?
-No, not enough
What?!
Get the aspirator, too much fluid
What is this?
ls it a monkey's skull?
Yes, it's 4000 years old.
ls the monkey 4000 yr. old?
-No, the skull is.
He used to be a ''Thol Porul''.
Don't do so much Tamil on me!
Which means an archaeologist.
l am not a writer like you,
just a doctor.
''Thol Porul!'' Must remember that word.
So he was really an archaeologist?
Yes. At Mohanjodaro and Harappa.
lndus valley civilization, right?
Exactly.
Grandpa, please open your mouth.
He excavated that place
l've seen the photographs...
somewhere in north lndia? lsn't it?
Northern than that, Pakistan.
lt'll be a little discomfort, Grandpa.
l'm pumping the phlegm out.
You'll breathe easier.
He's eighty something?
-More than that, 89. Born in 1910
Have you told him about your award?
Oh, Yes. Until last week, he was fine.
Whatever they might say..
l think mentally, he's far better off
than most others.
When did his mental illness start?
Among people who knew him
when he was sane..
the only one alive must be
my grandmother Mythili.
Grandpa spoke to no one but me.
He used to tell me lots of stories.
His stories were all in
the first person singular.
ls it?
lt was never
''once there was a king''
Rather, it went: ''Once, where
l lived, there also lived a king''
You could never tell
reality from fantasy
As a matter of fact,
my next novel is going to be
based on one of his stories.
lt's between biography and fiction.
An interesting mixture!
Really? Biography and Fiction?
Very lnteresting.
ls it a Thriller?
You could call it thriller too.
Where does take place?
Here in lndia.
Pre-partition lndia.
-l see..
around 1946
He was working with Mortimer Wheeler
an English archaeologist.
at Larkana district,
in North West Frontier.
Yes! This is a double
burial site all right.
Yes like the Lothal one.
Two in a grave.
Not the two of us!
The two of them.
Saket, Mr. Saket Ram
Yes Mr. Wheeler.
We have been ordered
to leave this site.
Why? May l ask, Sir?
Hindu-Muslim riot, Sir
Need l to say more?
What is it, this time, Sir?
We don't know the details,
but broadly, Pakistan.
All right, Mr.Wheeler.
Amjad, Enough now!
We have to leave.
Why?
A communal riot scare.
Hindu-Muslim riot.
We have to go to Karachi.
No way. No riot is going to
make me leave my grave.
Exactly.
We don't want it to become
''your'' grave, Mr. Amjad Khan,
We're leaving. lt's serious.
l'll give you one hour to
pack up and to safeguard...
what has been excavated.
Come on! Come on!
Quick! Quick!
lt's pack up time now.
Yes. Mr. Wheeler.
Yes, sir.
Okay , okay Patan.
Control your temper.
For 5000 years, it's been here.
lt won't go away. We'll come back.
Thousands of years before
Christ, this society had..
evolved a sewage system.
Here was a society where
children were given toys to play.
Ours gives us religion for adults
to fight each other with.
Okay. We do not live
in that society.
One hour, Gentlemen! That's all!
Yes, Mr. Wheeler!!
Say Salaam
to the Brahmin Uncle
You all go.
Father, are you not joining us?
We know what you are going to do.
We are going away.
Father, But l never..
Tell him, Brahmin..
We never...
Telling lies is....
worse sin than this...!
Amjad...
-Yes, Mother?
Return home early!
You go, l'll be there.
Nafisa, take care of him.
-Yes.
Let us go driver.
To lndia!
Yes! To lndia!
Which lndia do you desire?
Full or half?
Ah, Ram,
What is your poise then?
Partition, Sir?
l want a single country.
l am sure, Amjad wants Pakistan
and a larger one is that.
No way, Sir!
They want to impose Shariat
(Shariat - lslamic Law)
l wouldn't get to drink.
No. Thank you.
No large Pakistan.
Larger Rum is all right by me.
Cheers!
You are here Sindhi!
Behave yourself, l'll thrash you.
Large whisky please!
How are you Mr. Wheeler?
-Fine!
Tell me, how did you
know that it's me?
l can recognize
a fool by smelling.
Nafisa, with Amjad around,
your house must be stinky. Right?
Good evening madam!
Not at all!
l smell only perfumes!
A fool wears perfume
to hide his stink!
Mr. Wheeler, lt's a Tamil Joke.
Lalwani, we have to stop work.
-Why?
lndia-Pakistan Problem.
He wants Pakistan.
Who says l do?
Some people do.
l'm off to Calcutta.
to meet my wife. lt's been 20 days.
And l am wondering, why the Pandi
isn't talking about his wife yet.
When are you going
to Calcutta, brother?
ln a couple of days
Then l'll have to go to Calcutta too.
-Why?
Fool, The Raksha Bandan coming,
she has to tie Rakhi on me.
Raksha Bandan: Hindu practice affirming
bond between brother and sister.
Oh l forgot! This one happens
to be your foster brother.
We also go to Calcutta.
Let's all go.
-No Jokes?
Of course. No...!
l always wonder how
Lalwani and Amjad can speak...
a Dravidian language.
You are from Madras, right?
-Yes Mr. Bright
Alama Mater.
We went to Madras Christian
college together.
My father used
to sell carpet in the south
Also, my wife is a Tamil Muslim
from Amboor.
Amber!..
No Sir! lt's not Amber.
lt's Amboor..
Boor... And You!
No l am not a Boor.
l am a Sindhi, Sir!
You're Lalwani...
Come and Take a seat
He is already henpecked.
Call from his new wife!
Come along.
Have another drink.
Don't trouble him.
Just now l was .
remembering you
as Bengalis are boring.
Okay. Shut-up.
l love you! l miss you!
Stop mumbling and speak up.
So you are calling from post office.
Bloody Calcutta phones.
Keep it up.
Why keep anything from friends?
Amjad and Lalwani..
No, l am married to you.
Not them.
They are after me.
Not me..
Madam, How are you?
We're are very eager to meet you.
Yes! Ram says that
you cook very well.
Don't worry! Ram will make it to
Calcutta in a month or so.
Why are you doing this?
Aparna.
What?.. Tamil woman's voice...
Oh she.. That's Amjad's wife.
Nafisa.
You have nothing to worry about.
We together settled the first wife's matter.
Ram hasn't told you?
Sister-in-law, Amjad is lying
through his teeth!
There's no Mrs. Asha Ram!
The story about Ram paying her
for a settlement is completely false!
Hello Amjad back now.
Here we are having quarrel.
Call us back later!
Hey Ram, don't hit him!
No! Don't beat up Ram.
Sorry, Sarojji. Bye.
ldiot! Rascal!
She is calling from a post office.
What are you doing?
Worrying for you.
-too much
for you
The ordered wedding necklace
for Aparna from Madras?
Did you tell her about it?
They didn't even let me talk to her!
Poor thing. She must be worried.
Have a drink.
Drink good whisky. No worries.
Fool, if l drink here,
how will it help Aparna's worry?
Besides, l don't like whisky.
-Good!
Have some Rum.
-That's for horses.
No! Not just horses,
but for donkey, too!
Drink it up! Here.. Hold him.
Water..
Here is the water.
No. Not just wafer.
-Why?
l need a bit of rum too.
Even this is a joke?
-Even you need rum!
Thank you!
Now someone should sing
a Tamil song.
Well, l don't understand the applause.
There was no singing.
The applause was for your Tamil, Sir.
Thank you!
You sit down..
Salaam sahib! Remember me?
Me.. Altaf Tailor?
Altaf! What's happening?
Don't worry, sir. Today is
Mr. Jinnah's Direct Action Day.
Your wife doesn't come
to me anymore.
Has she found someone else?
Go on, sahib..
What 's happening?
-Today's Aug. 16th Sir.,

Even touch is on ration?
Well, thank you, ma'am.

Okay. Your father will be very angry.
He will disown you.

Come and meet me.
We have a lot to do.

How many did you
kill yesterday?
l am a murderer.
ln anger l have
the guts to kill people.
But l can't pick up
the courage to kill myself.
You have your reasons,
your faith, your philosophy.
l have no excuses. Half my life,
half my soul is dead! Gone!
l am not a man like this, Sir!
My wife! ln front of me, they...
My sister. 20 men
enjoyed raping her.
After they were done,
they killed her.
There are so many like me...
so many mothers, so many sisters..
ls your wife dead?
Who do you think
is responsible for all this?
Bengal Premier Suhrawardy?
No.
Barrister Mohammed Ali Jinnah?
No!
There is only one man,
my friend.
Barrister Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.
From the very beginning,
he has been appeasing them.
Beginning with the Khalafat movement..
he has watered this trend
the small green sapling...
and now lt is huge tree!
Where are you going?
To the police.
l won't lead them to you.
l go to seek punishment
for my crimes.
Punishment?
Who is to punish whom?
The law has taken leave.
But we are still at work.
l will explain. Come!
Listen, Punishment
is for crime.
Not for doing one's duty.
lf killing is crime,
then so is war. lsn't it?
A soldier who kills in war,
ls he a criminal?
l am not a soldier!
l am a civilian!
This is civil war brother!
ln this hour of the country's crisis every one
of us will have to become soldiers.

This is a good omen!
Sister! Look! The Lord's palanquin!

Life goes on!
Your father's final wish
is to be born of you again.
You are distracted,

Bhashyam. To the Lord, l pray
that my dear husband

After that, l am ready to go!
Once, l play with your son,

God damn it!
We're on course...

Grandfather's initials.
And that Krishna...
Mythili did that too.

Who's Radcliffe?
The great man who will

Alas! Auntie!
What happened
Sister,
are you all right?
Nothing serious.
Hypoglycemia.
Auntie, when was it
the last time you ate?
Yesterday!
You haven't had anything
but coffee since yesterday.
lt must be the bile.
Not bile. The star configuration.
Neither.
-Then what might it be?!
Stop shouting and go away
Close the wiindows.
lt must be 24hrs since you ate last.
Why you want to go on hunger strike
like Gandhi at this age?
Are you making fun of Gandhi?
All his people are like this.
He is different from the crowd.
Happened to be my relative.
He even makes fun of God.
No, Uncle.
l'm just being practical.
l wasn't making
fun of the Mahatma.
As a doctor, l was just advising
that long fasts are unhealthy.
lf you and l fast,
the result is sickness.
When the Mahatma fasts,
the result is lndependence.
Have you eaten?
-No. But l've just had my fill.
Must be gas.
You should eat.
Make sure you remember the things
l told you. Don't worry.
The milk is here.
l do not drink milk.
Why?
Doctor's advice?
lnteresting, isn't it?
Gandhiji's autobiography.
The book is mine.
l'm sorry.
No, read it.
Did you like the book?
No, l usually don't like this biographies...
There was nothing else to read..
Let me change into

Sir,
Aparna
-Aparna?
Third floor.
Third floor.. Oh!
You're Mr. Nair's guest.
Yes..
How can l help you?

Been here six months.
But l've no idea
who the last tenant was.
All the tenants here are new.
What's the name again?
-Saket Ram.
When did you see him last?
-Whom?
Saket Ram.
One year ago!
Exactly one year.
Please don't get me wrong.
But a year ago...,
there was a massacre
in this building.
Your Saket Ram...
Maybe he was killed? Sorry!
No. lt's all right.
Then looking for him
would be futile?!
No harm in searching.
What is your relationship
with Saket Ram?
Like body and soul.
We were very good friends.
May l have that painting?
l'm willing to pay for it...
Hey! Ram.
Shall l tell you how l died?
Ram, let me tell you.
Down with Gandhi!
Down with Suhrawardy!
Where's Suhrawardy?
He is here,
Call him!
Here he is.
Now please...
listen carefully to what he has to say.
Friends and brothers, it is
good fortune of Bengal...
Gandhiji has blessed
Calcutta with his presence
And it is now possible for Hindus
and Muslims to live peacefully side by side.
lt's our privilege that Mahatmaji
is with us at this hour
Will Bengal realize the privilege
and stop the fratricide?
Were you not responsible
for all the killing
in Calcutta and Bengal
that took place last year?
We all are responsible.
No! Please!
Please answer the question!
Were you not responsible
as the premier of the state?!
Were you not directly responsible for
making murderers out of ordinary men?
Give us a straight answer.
Yes.
lt was my responsibility.
and... l was responsible.
Bravo! Good!
Long live Mahatma Gandhi.
Makes you nauseate
Mr. Saket Ram!
Abhyankar?
10 months in jail
for evading arrest.
They couldn't prove anything,
else against me.
Heard that lecture
from Suhrawardy?
And he takes support
of a snake like Suhrawardy.
What kind of Mahatma is he?
The public remembers nothing.
Only you and l remember.
This senseless flock follows
the old man who survives on goat milk.
This flock doesn't know that he is
leading them to the Bakri ldd!
(Bakri ldd-Muslim festival)
ln between, a theater is staged
to run the state.
No permission for the
critics to watch it!
Hindu and Muslim!
Brothers! Brothers!
Germany and England!
Brothers!
China and Japan!
Brothers!
Goat and Butcher!
Brothers!
And what about the ladies?
Brothers!
All of them?
-yes...
Then who will be your wife?
l have two wives!
Mother, uncle Chari's
astrology was correct!
Yes! He's back!
Looks like Bharathiar with huge
handle-bar moustache.
Bharathiar- a Tamil Poet
Come over, Mother! l'll tell you
the rest when l see you.
Sorry!
-That's all right!
l am sorry!
Why?
Because l left
without telling you.
But you're still a child.
You won't understand.
Now it is your turn
to apologize again.
For..?
For thinking that l'm a kid.
This is not child marriage.
And our marriage is adult marriage.
All l knew in the beginning
is that l'm your second wife.
Now l know what
you've been through.
You were just three months old
when your mother died. Right?
You never even saw her.
Right?
l have her photo.
But not the mother.
Sister Vasantha is
like my mother.
Just hearing about Calcutta,
was shocking.
You've been through it all!
l hope l didn't hurt you
by talking about your first wife.
This is a peace offering.
For you.
l hope you don't mind.
Aparna painted this.
Do you know who Aparna was?
-Yes.
A peace offering. To you.
l painted it.
l hope you don't mind.
Aandaal -
(Aandaal - Hindu Goddess, who was in
love with God but never met God.)
lf you can't accept me as your wife,
you can accept as Aandaal ?
Can l be your Shaki?
Friend?
Can l hug you?
First time!
What?
l saw you smile!
Did l smile?
-Yes!
But l caught a glimpse.
for fraction of a second.
Second time!
Caught red-handed!
Hat trick!
Ram, could you come down?
-What?
The astrologer Chari from Mannarkudi
is here to see you.
To see me?
-Yes. Hurry up.
Why are you interested
in my horoscope?
Please explain it to him
the way you explained it to us.
You have been to the digs in
Harappa and Mohenjo Daro.
But do you know the meaning
of the word Mohenjo Daro?
Yes.
These people do not.
Mohenjo Daro means
''The Mound of the Dead''
Right!
So...?
The ghosts of the dead...
have got you!
No doctor has
a cure for this disease.
Not even God?
-How can l say that?
lf you can't, you may leave.
-Ram!
No. Do not scold the child.
lt is not he who speaks.
Something makes him say this.
lt is not your misktake. After rituals
the mind will return to normal.
Whose mind will
become normal?
lt is not l who said that.
No one here seems
to be speaking of his own.
lf it's the ghost
who makes me speak,
lt's the uncle's money
that makes you speak.
Everyone here and you
are saying l've gone mad?
He doesn't mean to say that, Son-in law.
Well, tell me what he means, Uncle?
Ram, you may not believe in this.
But for the sake of those who believe...
lf you believe in all this, then go
ahead, perform all those rituals.
Are you leaving on your own? Or...?
Arumugam!
No! l understand.
lt's a bad omen to ask a person
where he is going.
lt'd be better if you told the elders
before you left.
We aren't school-children.
We needn't take their permission.
Did you say ''We''?
Yes!
Pack!
Take nice dress.
We are meeting important people.
Go and ask him!
Where is he taking Mythili?
lf she becomes pregnant,
lt'd be a scandal!
This is no time for jokes!
-Enough. Wait.
We have given him our daughter.
Where he takes her is no business
of ours. Don't irritate him
My nephew isn't in his senses!
What if he takes your daughter..
and dumps her somewhere?
lf he wanted to dump her..
he would 've dumped her here.
Do you understand?
What is she saying?
She has given you a supply of ldlis
and chutney (ldli -steamed cake)
Chutney with spot
of oil will be delicious.
Food at railway station is not good.
Also packed some mango pickle
Thank you, Auntie!
Thank you!
May l take Uncle
Bhashyam's blessings?
Okay!
Make it fast.
Give a sign through
the car window.
lf leaving from Egmore, raise one finger.
lf leaving from Central, two fingers.
Touch my feet.
We'll follow you. You'll be fine.
May you live long as a married woman!
Go!
He is getting tense!
Are we taking the train from
Central Station, or Egmore Stations?
l smiled a fourth time.
You missed seeing it?
Am l bothering you?
No. My eardrums will burst.
lt's the plane's engines.
Sorry. Go on.
-No. No. Get back to reading.
ls that a dirty book?
lt's covered with brown paper...
Somethings are better
done under cover.
Mahatma says it's a sin to hide.
Even covered, your blouse is pretty.
Shame on you! He is speaking
about speech and deeds
What do you think of this
talk? This one...
There is always good
behind what Mahatma says.
Revenge is not going to
solve the problem.
ls this the only way
to solve the problem?
By the time he has finished
protecting them before going to Pakistan,
there won't be any of us
left here to be protected.
Mahatma...
He has three kinds
of monkeys, around him.
The first,
will only hear Mahatma.
The second,
keep their mouth shut.
Lest they let slip
some criticism against Mahatma.
The third,
close their eyes...
and pretend to live in a world
of Gandhi-esque fantasy.
What kind are you?
Among those cronies
who use proximity to Mahatma
for political gains...You might find
monkeys like these.
But as far as l am concerned...
l'm the monkey that see,
hear, or speak no evil.
But if it be good, my eyes, ears,
and my mouth are always open.
Good.
Then you may read this book.
lt's history.
l hate semi-fiction.
Touché!
Looks like Hindi.
Don't understand.
-Marathi.
Vande Matheram!
-Vande Matheram!
Welcome to Maharastra!
This is Abhyankar...
Pande. Ramkrishna Pande.
What's in a name?
lt's the person who is important.
And this is...?
-Mythili. My wife.
Wife?
Yes. We're just married.
Why? l mean,
when did you marry?
A couple of months ago.
Madam, welcome
to Maharashtra.
You can be informal.
Very well.
Come, Mythiri.
Mythili
-Come!
Going hunting with Maharaja, tomorrow.
Do you like hunting?
l'm a vegetarian!
-He is a vegetarian too. Right?
l am a vegetarian.
But l can still go on a hunt.
Will you come?
No, l won't! How could people have
the heart to shoot innocent animals?
lf you have the heart to eat it
why not shoot it?
Besides, it is for pleasure.
Whose pleasure?
-For man's pleasure.
What else?
Nice car
lt isn't mine.
lt belongs to the Maharaja.
Ram, specially for you.
What if animals were
to hunt you for pleasure?
Beg your pardon.
-l'll tell her..
First, they will have
to invent the guns.
lf a wolf was to attack your child,
would you say it was justified?
From the point of view
of the wolf,...
yes, justified.
Ram, What would you like to eat?
Venison? Of rabbit?
l am a vegetarian, your Highness.
Hunting is just a passion.
My vegetarian hunter.
Only passion!
No hunger!
No solid reasons?
Just the need to kill!
He looks like a suitable candidate.
-Probably.
Photo please!
Shall l have the gate opened,
Maharaja?
l beg your pardon your Highness?
-l am sorry!
l said all the doors now are
closed for Rajas like me.
So what is the use of
opening only this door?
Ram?
Call the peddler.
But that's poor man's food,
Maharaja!
When Sardar Patel rules, Maharajas
will have to learn to live on pappad.
Pappad! Come here!
(Pappad - wafers)
Coming Sir.
Pappad and Pickle!
Leave the whole basket here! Take this.
You have Maharaja's grace today.
l wonder if he could
count the money.
Don't worry your Highness.
That's what l used to do in Karachi.
Lalwani?
Ram!
Your Highness! He is a close friend
of mine from Karachi..Lalwani..
What happened to you?
The house...the shops..
went up in flames. They torched it.
Where's your wife Bina?
She lost her dignity.
Then she was killed.
The children ?...
The cholera epidemic in the refugee
camps..took the elder one.
The younger...Romila....?
You even remember...
her name?
Somehow...she just slipped
out of my hands...
Slipped out of your hands?
Dropped from my hand. But couldn't
find her in the crowd.
Never Ram!
Never let go of your children.
Are your parents doing fine ?
...train full of bodies..dead!
You won't understand.
You're a South lndian.
No, Lalwani.
l too understand very well.
You understand..!!
l am sorry, Your Highness!
Greetings, madam!
Gone! What is gone is gone!
Forget it!
Drink it up.
Best medicine for worries. Drink!
-Nowadays l don't drink.
All right! All right!
What all right! This is ..Soma
(an opiate) drink.
Ram drink.. it is okay.,
Victory to Ram Chandra!
Ram, Maharaj calling you..
Sure! Let's go!
-You don't have to come Lalwani sir
Rajasaheb wants to talk
to Ram in private.
We just now rejoined after a long time
soon you are separating us..
Mythili, We'll be back
in 5 minutes.
Gentlemen,
if our Hindu
soul is to survive,...
this Mahatma must die.
The misfortune of this
Hindu nation is...
it's worst enemy is...
a practicing Hindu!
Right from beginning,
he has been taking their side...
and neglecting the people
of his own religion.
For centuries we have been worshipping the
Valour and it's accompanying instruments
He now wants us to change
our form of worship...
and pray to a new God,
Himself...
and a new religion,
Ahimsa
He is feeding water to the weed again and
again and it's growing into a tree.
My brave men,
it should be done as a symbolic act...
and not as a revenge..
But to show the world...
and the country...what a Hindu
is capable of.
Shri Ram Abyankar.
Saket Ram.
But he is a married man, Rajasaheb....
-So what?
Say it like a true hunter.
Brave men,
today is Vijayadhasami
it seems like it's the will of Bhavani..
that it shall be a Ram
who should do the job.
Come, my Rams.
Choose your weapons.
Chosen well!
No, watch the dance!
No, no. Let's go upstairs.
What happened to you?!
Well doctor?
This Kathiawar horse once was
great and useful to me.
But now it burdens itself and others.
l think it would amount to kindness
to put him to sleep,...
lsn't it Ram?
Mr. Lalwani..you haven't left yet?
No, sir, actually l was waiting for you and
Ram to come, so l can say goodbye.
Well, l got your friend a job in Sangli.
Ram, good job.
Good money.
Thank you, your Highness!
Thank you very much!
Don't even mention it!
Ram, l'll meet Mr. Abyn...Mr.Pande
and come. You wait.
l should be leaving.
l am disturbing your romance
Thanks, Ram.
Why thank me ?
you made me forget my worries
sometime..
Farewell, madam.
Hi what..?
l must have done something good..
Nothing happened to you..
Crazy girl..nothing happened,
why you cry ?
My mother would never have
said this to father.
Maybe it didn't exist in their dictionary.
But l've been trying to tell you that...
shall l tell you..
l think...
l know l love you.
l think so too.
That's why l'm disturbed.
-Disturbed? Why?
Even l want to say ..l love you..
Say it.
But my hands are stained with blood.
You like hunting...hunting is no sin.
The tiger's Dharma is to hunt.
l love you, my tiger.
lf l tell you all the truth about myself..
would l find peace..?
Of course. Please tell me.
After seeing him tell me.
l want to know.
Ram.
How is he?
Well, he is.. all right.
But he will...never walk .
You mean his legs...
- Quadriplegia
Paralyzed from neck downwards.
Ram, Abyankar wants to see you.
-Come!.
No, l'm sorry Mrs. Ram.
Abyankar wants to
see only your husband.
lt is all right..please go ahead..
-l'll be back soon.
ls it very painful?
To know pain, one needs a body.
Gradually..you will recover.
-Why lie between us ?
l lost my body.
Remaining is my pure soul
l will give it to you.
Hereafter you are my soul
And you shall fulfill my duty.
You will, won't you?
And you shall do it not for me.
You shall do it for all of us.
For our Mother Nation.
Swear then, then you renounce
all bondage, all relationship.
You renounce...
-l!
l renounce...
l renounce all bondage, all relationship.
Touch my head and swear by me.
l swear.
The table on my right.
There's a parcel on it. Pick it up.
Place it on my chest.
Open it.
When the era of Gandhi is to end...
the Rajasahib shall decide.
He will send a telegram. You finish it.
Vande Materam.
We have to rush him
to the hospital.
Careful! Hold the head high.
Daddy, the ambulance hasn't arrived yet.
Can we use the van?
Are you coming?
No point crowding the place for nothing.
You go ahead.
They'd need someone to sign the consent
letter for the operation.
lt isn't must for the son to sign
the consent letter.
A grandson can sign it too.
Go on.
Did you wake up Grandma and tell her ?
No, you want both end up in
the hospital together?
She didn't sleep well last night..
Good or bad, we'll inform her later.
We must please hurry.
Heard that? That's how much
he loves his father!
What if l were to do it to him in his time?
Now it's important for us to
rush him to the hospital.
You can't go that way.
-Why?
Why...Forgotten what day it is?
Don't you read the papers?
The sixth. December 6.
Definitely there is a riot breaking out
today. Go back.
We're rushing a patient to the hospital.
Can we take the Beach Road ?
- No. That's closed too.
This is a matter of life and death!
That's just why we're stopping you.
Please! Just requesting. Main road will
get us to the hospital in 5 minutes.
Keep this. For the two of you.
Take! Will you feed me....
for the rest of my life if l lose my job?
Understand the emergency
and leave right away!
What's going on out there?
-They are leaving, sir.
Where are we headed?
-This is a short- cut.
lt leads straight to the petrol pump.
lf the police don't stop us,
we can cross it quickly..
Oh..God! l hate this religion and politics!
-So does God.
This combination of religion and politics
is dangerous! Just like sex and violence.
But commercial mix, everyone at the city
and village can understand.
Name? -Munawar
No! l'm a doctor! -What's yours?
Saket Ram. - What is this?
Going to hospital.
Open the door
Take him out of the van
and lower him into this hole..
He is a sick man, sir!
Has the magistrate issued
orders to shoot?
The magistrate has.
signed the orders
Thank God!
Boys, we have the shooting
orders. Be in control. Wait for my orders.
Fire!
Careful, you crazy girl!!
How are you?
-Same as ever.
Welcome! You grace us
with your divine presence!
What have we done to deserve this?
-Your sister sent us news...
l asked them over.
Mythili was missing her parents.
Hello!
When did you arrive?
-Just now.
Oh yes, Mythili was telling me...
-l didn't
Please come in.
Have you told your husband?
Why?
We talk little. When we were in
Maharashtra, he was very sweet to me.
After coming here he is like a
saint..growing beard..
You must've fought with him.
No. He just keeps to himself.
Sir...Telegram.
Please sign the receipt.
lsn't Uncle around?
-They have all gone to the hospital.
Why? -Don't know, sir.
-Come on in. Uncle isn't here now.
Enough now. Now say it.
-Please, you say it.
You should say it.
-Stop it, and just tell him.
A happy news, Son-in-law.
-l'm about to become a grand uncle!
And my wife is going
to become a grandmother.
And he, is a grandfather!
-What am l going to be?
Everyone is going to become
something or the other.
You're going to become a cousin.
-The soul is born again.
What are you staring at?
Come on, prostrate yourself.
Pay respect to everyone.
-That won't be necessary.
Uncle..
did you talk?
Uncle..
Dear Mythili
Marriage is believed by us to be
a bond for lifetimes to come.
But l sever my bond with you
in this lifetime.
ln the knowledge of the self...
may l attain eternal bliss
As l travel towards
the Supreme Soul..
may l transcend
attributes of the Self
Towards the Eternal, the Pure,...
all-pervasive Omniscience l travel
l seek to transcend emotion,
sense and desire
Mythili, you are a good girl
beautiful girl..
And you have been cursed
with a bad husband.
Beyond the cycles of birth
and death. Beyond life
Beyond the boundaries
of my mind
Beyond the darkness
Beyond my perceptions
Thou art
Thee, l behold in the form of a swan
The reasons for my actions
will be known shortly to you..
For the service l plan to do...
for our nation,
my relatives and friends
may be in my way
May the shadows of my failings
never touch our child.
l pray that our child
is born with your virtues.
l've never seen my mother.
Aunt Vasantha was
like a mother to me.
And now you too.
Your parents are going
to curse me.
Their anger is justified.
Now l belong to no one.
Loveless: Saket Ram
Sister, are you all right?
-She hasn't eaten all day...
lt's all over now.
Enlightenment,
thou shalt receive
by dint of thy Self
Make pure thy body and mind
For the path leads to solitude
Good morning, sir!
l am from south of lndia, sir. Madras...
l need a place to room.
You need to make a deposit, sir.
Can l have your name, sir?
Bhairav, K. Bhairav.
Porter, take his luggage
to room no.43.
Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.
My name is Govardhan.
Bhairav, are you from Karnataka?
No.
-Telugu? Tamilian!
ls your family coming too?
They will join you later?
l have no family.
You are like me.
Then you must be lonely.
Lucky room!
One of my customers stayed here.
What do you want?
l seek nothing!
Tell me what you want.
Do you drink?
Are you a pimp ?
How can you think of me so low.
l confess l am.
Okay. You must be really experienced!
You found out quickly.
This is my card.
Call me when you need company.
l can bring all varieties of people between
Kashmir and Kanyakumari.
lf you are particular about virgins that is
little difficult, but l can get it..
Good day, sir!
Are you going inside ?
Nehru is with him.
Also Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.
We could do it right here,
if you like.
Gopal...step aside.
Are these the servant's quarters?
-Yes.
ls this your room?
-Mine. Why?
l want to photograph Gandhiji.
The view through the window might
be interesting. May l take a look?
-l said yes. Go on.
But it's dark inside.
The bulb is not working.
No problem.
l'll come for the photographs
later on. Any objections?
l told you. Why are you asking me
over and over again?
But it's only the first time...
- You may be asking me for just once.
But that friend of yours,
he asked me ten times over.
Friend...?
-Yes, a photographer. Like you.
Gave me 10 Rupees.
Advance.
He'll give me another 10 after
he has taken the photographs.
So there's another photographer?
-Then you aren't his friend.
Out with ten Rupees.
This is a five...
right, ten.
That was advance.
You can pay ten afterwards.
Both shoot pictures.
Pathugaya suddenly said no.
-What?!
Rathu, are you all right?
-Yes, l am all right.
What Son-in-law? You made us worried
by saying you are leaving Mythili,...
We were shocked when we
read your letter!
Then our Rangappa showed us the
telegram that you had received.
There is nothing to be ashamed in serving
Gandhi. You could have told me..
This is Mr. Subash Goel,
an industrialist from Bombay.
Hello Mr. Saket Ram.
You had your father-in-law
very worried.
Thank God,
we found you.
Ever since you left,
nothing is good
Your uncle Jeganathan died.
Two days after he died..
your aunt can't bear.
She is dead too.
..Bhashyam uncle was bed-ridden
Mythili, my wife,
they are still alive!
Mr. Goel is very popular here.
He knows Mahathma personally..
Brothers and sisters. Bapu speaks
from his fasting.
And the mike also is not working.
Dr. Susheela and l will repeat Bapu's
words loudly for you to hear.
Brothers and Sisters...
The first thing that
l want to say to you is that...
l hope all those....
who have signed
the document of amity...
have signed it...
with God as their witness.
There are still voices
being raised in Calcutta
expressing the fear...
that what is happening here
may be all a show.
lf the people of Delhi...
....and the refugees
who have come here...
both stand firm....
then l am certain
whatever may happen outside
you will be able to save lndia.
as well as Pakistan.
lf you read carefully,..
what Sardar has said in Bombay,..
you will realize there is no rift ....
between Pandit Nehru and Sardar.
The fire. This is nothing!
Only the military doing target practice.
Sit down!
Sit down! Be calm.
Why did you get so scared?
What will you do if someone...
Son-in-law..No, don't go there
-Mr. Saket Ram.
This is sacrilege! These savages
want to kill a Mahatma!
We do live in the worst of times!
What do you think son-in law?
Don't worry. Tomorrow, Mr. Goyal will
take you to meet Gandhiji in person
What? Mr. Goyal ?
By tomorrow Bapu feels better, definitely
we will have a meeting.
Where are you going?
-To find a cab.
ls there a cinema theater nearby?
-Regal...but the picture is no good,sir.
Yes, gentlemen, listen to me
very carefully.
No one is going to leave this hotel
without my permission. Understood?
Constable, close the doors.
Where 's the manager?
-l just called him, sir.
You are the manager here?
-Yes, sir.
Search warrant. l would like to
search the whole hotel.
The man who is trying to kill
Mahatma is in here.
Please go ahead with your search.
There's no one in this room.
Open the door please.
-Who is it?
Police. Open the door please.
-Just a minute.
Where are you from ?
l don't speak Hindi..
Nathuram Godse is in Room No 40.
Sorry gentleman,
we disturbed you.
Kindly don't leave the room
without our permission. - All right..
The lorry will be back
only after 4 or 5 days.
We have a week's stock on hand.
How many do you want?
Just tell me where l can find that lorry.
Today. Now.
Actually, l was bending over
the balcony. My purse fell in it.
How much was there
inside the purse?
Rs 3000...
Rs 5000.
Your life is worth more than Rs 5000.
The owner of that soda factory...
is a Muslim.
The factory is near Chandni Chowk.
There's a curfew on over there.
Don't mind my saying this,
but forget the purse.
This one has left for Pakistan.
Just listen to me.
l'll get you a boy, girl, beast, or whatever
else you fancy in New Delhi
Even if we stay little longer it is
dangerous. Please Bhairav.
Then, l'm leaving sir. l am planning to
reach home alive.
You don't leave until l complete my job.
Why? Are you threatening me ?
Just telling you. That's all
You're going to get me killed!
Stop your dangerous game!
Don't you give respect to the age?
You just want a girl...
No, l don't want a girl.
l'm looking for Azad Soda Factory.
Soda factory?Tell me the truth.
Who are you?
Hey! Ram.
Hey! Brahmin!
l thought you're a Muslim.
What are you doing here?
ls this fellow troubling you?
No, he's...
A friend.
You didn't tell me
you have friends here!
He didn't know that
l'm staying here.
You are..?
Govardhan. A bossom friend
of this man here.
Are you all right?
How is Aparna?
Killed in the Calcutta riots.
l'am sorry. Let's not talk here.
Curfew time
Come, come to my home.
l'm settled here now.
Not in Karachi.
No, some other time.
l have some work.
Fool, do you know what a curfew is?
You'll get shot!
Come on. Leave the work for later.
-No! l'm looking for an address.
30 minutes to go for the curfew.
Hardly any time now.
Come on home.
Meet your sister Nafisa.
This is not Madras.
You'll end up mince-meat.
What's the address?
Tell him. He's your friend.
He'll find it right the way!
Shut up! Actually, my purse fell
into a soda truck.
Some Azad Soda Factory.
Do you know it?
Come.
Oh come on!
My brother...he wants
to see Uncle Jalal.
Open sesame!
See you then. Goodbye.
Where are you going? Curfew time.
Stay here tonight.
Uncle, you're getting me wrong!
He's a friend.
One of them lost his purse.
lt fell into one of your trucks.
He's here looking for his purse.
-Purse?
Your nephew is a traitor!
l knew it when he said...
he's Gandhi's disciple.
He's hand-in-glove with the Hindus!
Now you will see for yourself!
You might have a point.
Let's discuss Amjad later.
First, let me deal with
the kaffirs.
Uncle! Ram isn't that type.
-Silence!
Your friend's purse has
turned into gun.
One cartridge can kill
one, or maybe four.
Ram, tell the truth.
Uncle, let me clarify this.
l know him for a long time.
He's like a brother to my wife.
Ram, l know it isn't your gun.
Don't be scared!
Amjad, the gun is mine.
But l haven't come here
to kill anyone.
Just let me have the gun.
l'll go away.
Goodness! You dragged me
into this hole!
l'm just a poor pimp, sir!
A couple of bullets and he'll sing.
Then we'll know how they plan....
to kill our Muslim brothers
hiding in your factory.
No, Qureshi!
You are mistaken!
Ram is honest!
Besides everyone keeps
guns nowadays.
l know him as well...
as l know myself.
Then you don't know yourself!
l won't kill him.
l'll shoot him in the knees.
Get out of my way!
-No!
Don't let him escape!
Surround him.
Get him alive!
That bastard has a story to tell!
Mr. Chari, l'm Govardhan,
the co-ordinator, sir!
There's no point in calling
the police. So l called you.
l was in the Jama Masjid area
with a client.
We were rounded up and taken
to the Azad Soda Factory.
There's a whole army of Muslims
armed with rifles over here.
l'm calling you on the sly!
Come right away...
and save me!
Yes, Azad Soda Factory.
Tell me the truth.
l can still save your life!
Did you come here
to kill Muslims? -No.
But this gun...-Mine.
But why did you bring it here?
l didn't. Your Uncle's truck
brought it here. Okay, l am leaving now..
Are you mad?!
Fool! You'll die..
Fool! l don't know why you are
carrying this gun...
but you'll need my help
to get out of here.
l don't need anyone's help!
l'll escape on my own.
And you're going to shoot
your way through, won't you?
Which means that gun is meant
for killing Muslims!
lt isn't,
but it could be.
Are you a murderer too?
And why?!
Why?
Because your Aparna is dead?!
She was killed! Like countless Hindu men,
women and children! By Muslims..
And you're here to take avenge for
the entire Hindu community...?
Do you remember my father?
He didn't die on his own.
The Hindus killed him!
This way...
Enough!
Just go away.
Get out! Out of our sight!
Go away?
Where?
To your Jinnah's Pakistan!
Jinnah's daughter considered lndia
as her own country, and stayed back.
l am Gandhi's son
l have decided to stay here.
Decided?
With whose permission?
l don't need anyone's permission
to live in my own country!
Your country?
You foreigners walked across the Khyber...
and ruled us for 700 years!
l was not born then.
l belong to your times!
Many came from the Khybar.
Why pick on me?
Not that way!
You call me a Foreigner!
Aren't you also a foreigner?
Some say that your Lord Ram
came across the Khybar.
Don't you dare mention
my Ram's name!
lf not your Ram,
O.K., Can l talk about my Ram?
What's happened to you?!
l may not be your brother.
At least, am l not your friend?
That's just why
you are still alive.
Leave before l change my mind.
Now.
Everything was peaceful for
a few days, thanks to Gandhi.
See what you started!
-You started it. -me?
You!
You people killed Aparna!
O.K. l will put an end to it too.
Forgive me for killing
your Aparna.
l forgive you
for killing my father.
Now will you accept me
as your brother, Ram?
Very well, then.
Shoot!
l'll give you the pleasure
of killing Muslim!
And once done, cleanse
your heart of the hatred.
Let my death save you
from this madness!
Somebody will have to put
a full stop to this.
l am here to stop this with blood.
But not by killing you.
l'm here to kill the cause.
Whom do you think is the cause?
Altaf Tailor.
Not Suhrawardy.
Not even Jinah.
Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
No Ram,...
Gandhi is the only sanity in this country.
Are you mad?
You you are mad.
l'll get you out of here.
Not your people. Hindus.
Ram, you don't want
me die, right?
Gandhiji is right.
We can be brothers!
Only if we try!
We just have to try.
Try! Try!
Brahmin,
lf anything happens to me...
take care of your sister Nafisa.
This is Bhairav.
l am Chari.
Are you from the Gwalior unit?
He is Tamilian!
-ls that right?
l heard there's a small group of Pakistans
at the Soda Factory.
And they have guns.
We're running short of handguns.
l hear you have one,
isn't it?
Very good.
We are going to
attack the soda factory.
No! Please! Do not go the soda factory.
There is nothing there...
Just some old men, women and
children and ...
some people guarding them.
l will show you where they
are hiding the guns.
He is my brother.
Bharat. That's his name.
He's madly in love with a...
Muslim girl, Nafisa.
He is mentally ill.
You are mad!
Ever since, he has been...
dressing up like this.
l came to stop him before he converts...
to lslam in this madness.
Come home, Bharat
He's lying!
His name is Amjad.
Shut up, you pimp!
Bharat. That's his name.
Bharat or Amjad?
We'll find out when we strip him.
No. Don't insult me!
l'll tell you.
l am Ram's brother.
But not Bharat.
My name is Amjad Ali Khan.
You may call me...
Amjad Ali Khan Bahadur.
Go away from here!
Get out! All of you!
Where are we to go?
What's this! Treating your own people...
Amjad, what happened to you?
What happened to my son?
Hajiraji (baby about to be born!)
No!
No! Quershi.
He saved my life!
Please stop!
Most of our men are dead.
And we have no more bullets.
Send your people in
to check.
There are only
women and children here.
We are not fighting.
We are just defending, brothers!
He's fighting for us.
Happy?
We are the police.
We're here to help you.
We know that you were attacked.
Drop your arms.
l think we are late.
No,no. You can take this man.
He is badly hurt.
Quick! Get the stretcher.
Ram, may Allah give you
a long life.
This child owes
his life to you.
This is Qureshi's son.
Where is Qureshi?
Ram, where is my son?
Where is my Amjad?
Where is Amjad?
ls he all right?
After Gandhiji's fast, we were able to
sleep peacefully for a few days.
Look at this, it has started all over...
just because one stupid man
with a gun.
Murder, riots, not a single bed is empty.
Mr. Ram, this way...
Look at that! They don't even
spare children.
The poor child has not even
decided about her god.
Dr. Mani, What's happening?
What's going on here?
l told them it's very serious.
Look, he can die talking to you.
He's the only one who can help us.
We must know to avoid more
people getting hurt.
Just one more question, please.
Whatever you want to know,
you ask him and get out.
This isn't your police station.
Mr. Amjad, Govardhan said there was a
Hindu man, Bhairav, with a gun.
We could not get much out of him,
more than that.
Govardhan said you know him.
Can you tell us about him?
Ram! My brother!
l know he saved your life.
Mr. Ram, just a second.
All eye-witnesses are dead.
And the Hindu mobs have escaped.
We have no other clue except Amjad.
Mr. Amjad, do you remember Bhairav?
Ram! My brother!
Have you seen Bhairav before?
l've never seen that animal before!
l only know Ram...
my brother!
He saved my life!
Enough, inspector! Please go.
Out, out! Quick!
There are 3 more patients who are critical
and l don't want to disturb them.
Would you take Amjad's wife and
his mother and tell them?
Tell them what?
lt's over.
He is gone.
But doctor, doctor is doing something!
-We are doing our best.
Take my word.
He is no more.
he is gone.
Mrs. Amjad, please come.
Please you also come.
What happened?
lf you need medicines,
we can buy medicines.
What is going on behind my back ?
Don't shoot me from behind...
be a man shoot my ugly face from front
Come! Come!
Bapu, they are from Pannoor.
They said they have suffered very badly.
They want you to do some more
to help them.
l am trying.
What we douse this fire
with is love.
l can only beg, plead,
and go on a fast.
What more can l do?
l can tell you what you can do, Mahatmaji,
But will you listen to me ?
Go ahead.
-You have utterly ruined us!
Enough! Leave us alone...
and go away!
Where do you want me to go?
Where people of our age go...
to the Himalayas.
This is my Himalayas.
To die in your service is
my duty.
One man says go away.
Another says, stay here and save us.
Who am l to listen to ?
l will only listen to the voice of God.
lt could be God talking to you
through me!
Why don't you listen to this voice
and go away?!
Enough now! Please go away!
Where to go ?
We have no place to go to!
Tell them to stay.
l will finish with those people...
and listen to them again.
lf they have to vent their anger,
it is better they vent it on me.
Rather than on some Muslim brothers.
Tell them to wait.
At least respect him as your elder,
if nothing else!
You are getting yourself off.
How can we introduce them of kindness...
if we who keep advising them cannot
control our own tempers?
l am not a Mahatma, Bapu.
This girl seems to be insinuating
that l am a Mahatma.
Yesterday l slipped and fell
in the bathroom.
lf l had died there, the world
would've known l'm not a Mahatma.
But you are a Mahatma.
Bapu, this is my friend from Madras,...
Mr.Uppili lyengar.
You too are a Mahatma,
Mr. Uppili.
lf one is not a Mahatma,
one is an animal.
This is Saket Ram,
Mr.Uppili's son-in-law.
He's the one who saved so many Muslim
men in the incident near Jama Masjid.
My Ram from the south.
This is Hajira Begum.
Amjad's mother.
This is Nafisa.
l'm Amjad wife. He promised to walk
with you to Pakistan.
She is Ram's foster sister.
When did she become
your sister?
Before my country was torn
into two pieces.
See, Mr. Uppili, even your son-in-law
is also a Mahatma.
No, l am not.
Most Mahatmas don't tell me
they are one.
Do you think l am one?
You will deny it if l say you are, so
l shall deny you another denial sir..
Nafisa, l am already liking your brother.
About Amjad...
l am deeply sorry.
You know Ram..l am willing to take
all this communal hatred...
in the form of a bullet.
lf l am promised...
that along with that bullet,
they will also bury ....
this communal hatred, and live
together as one community.
That's exactly what Amjad said
before he was struck down.
You both must walk with me
to Pakistan.
Amjad has promised to do so,
now you must fulfill his promise.
Excuse me, l'm a little tired
and over-committed today.
You please come tomorrow.
Bring them also.
l Speak little little Tamil.
''Nettiku vaan''.
''Nettiku'' is tomorrow, isn't it?
No, Bapu, ''Nettiku'' is yesterday.
Tomorrow is ''Naalaiku''.
My critics are right. This Gandhi
is still stuck with yesterday.
Doctor, the oxygen
cylinder is empty.
Mythili, take me out.
There's a shoot outside.
Why?
-Hindu-Muslim riots outside, grandpa.
Still!
Saket Ram,
lt's pack up time!
Wake me up!
You're lucky. You are alive.
How is the patient?
He is no more.
Sorry!
Excuse me, what's your name?
lbrahim.
He has left me all alone, Nafisa.
Saket, This is Tushar Gandhi,
Mahatma Gandhi's great grandson.
My son, Saket Ram Jr.
l have read your books.
l am your fan.
l am your fan, too.
No. You are mistaken.
You must be my great grandfather's fan.
l am just a great grandson.
But you're a great writer.
-Thank you.
l wish he had heard you say that.
He was so proud of this child.
Come over here.
The key to your grandfather's
personal safe.
He wanted you to have it.
Show Mr.Tushar your grandfather's room.
Please go and see the room.
You'll like it.
Mr. Gandhi, l think l have the most
extraordinary story to tell you.
Sure, l like your stories very much.
lt's not just my story.
lt's your story too.
ln fact, its ours now.
Nurses must do their duty
even though..
God is present by the patient's side.
lf the nurse doesn't attend to patient
on time, he may well die.
The same is true here.
Even a minute's delay
from prayer meeting...
Please, Bapu is late for the meeting.
l have a confession to make.
l also have a confession to make!
l'm ten minutes late!
At my age, every second counts!
And to waste it amounts to murder!
Please, Bapu, listen to me.
You listen to me, Ram...
When we walk to Pakistan together,
we will confess our sins to each other.
There will be days of walking and
lots of time.
Just now l don't have time.
You have been feeding me
cattle fare.
Bapu, you used to call
it horse fare.
lt is not grand of me to relish what
no one else will even touch.
Brother, Bapu is already late
for his meeting.
No! No violence!
This is a moment of truth!
This is a chance to prove
that we believe in non-violence.
No! Don't touch him!
We are all Bapu's children.
No violence!
This is a moment of truth!
We announce with profound grief
that Mahatmaji has passed away.
Stop it. Do not be foolish,
it was not a Muslim. lt was a Hindu.
How did you know it?
l didn't. Was it a Hindu?
-Yes.
Thank God for that! Or the country
would be torn apart.
Let's announce it.
-That's a good idea, Pandit.
l think we should announce it here
in Delhi immediately.
