THE LAST COMMAND
Hollywood - 1928!
The Magic Empire of the
Twentieth Century!
The Mecca of the World!
To this Hollywood
had come Leo Andreyev,
a Russian director ...
"Every Russian in Hollywood
is in that stack!"
Sergius Alexander
Claims to have been
commanding general ...
... of Russian Army
and cousin to Czar.
Little film experience --
Works for $7.50 a day.
"Have him report to work
tomorrow morning ..."
"... and fit him into
a General's uniform!"
"The Eureka Studio calling ..."
"Six tomorrow morning ...
studio gate!"
The Bread Line of Hollywood.
"Quit your shovin'!
Who do you think you are?"
"One Corporal!"
"One General!"
"Quit shakin' your head!
How do you expect me
to make up?"
"Excuse me, please ...
I can't help it ... I ...
I had a great shock once!"
"Where'd you get the
gadget from ... steal it
out of a hock shop?"
"The Czar gave it to me."
"What do you know about
that? The Czar gave him
this beautiful medal!"
"I'm your pal ... I want to
show it to everybody ..."
Imperial Russia - 1917.
Proud, majestic, haughty ...
seemingly eternal at the ages!
On a dozen far-flung battle
fronts, Russia was engaged ...
... in a death grapple
with the enemy.
Tireless in the defense of
a crumbling empire was the ...
... Grand Duke Sergius Alexander,
cousin to the Czar ...
... and Commanding General
of the Russian Armies.
"Everything is in perfect order,
Your Imperial Highness ...
... There is no need for you to
tire yourself with an inspection."
"The revolutionists have
intercepted most of our
supplies."
"Let him strut a little longer!
His day are numbered!"
"The days of all who
are dragging Russia down
are numbered!"
"Only a few weeks more ...
but they seem an eternity!"
"We have waited too long
to be impatient now!"
"You are ordered to report
for passport examination
in the morning."
"They are actors playing for
the troops and their pasports
are in order ...
... but our reports show
they are revolutionists ..."
"... she is Natalie Dabrova,
the most dangerous
revolutionist in Russia!"
"Let's have them up!
He's dangerous enough ...
... and she's pretty enough ...
to merit my personal attention!"
"The second time this week
you've worn my coat and
smoked my cigarettes!"
"If he does it again ...
... remove the coat and
shoot the contents!"
"So you two are serving
your country ... by acting!"
"A fine patriotic service...
when Russia is fighting
for her life!"
"Why aren't you in uniform?"
"My lungs are weak."
"Perhaps it is your courage
that is weak!"
"It doesn't require courage
to send others to battle
and death!"
"Put him under arrest!"
"What is this man to you?"
"Nothing at all. He is Leo
Andreyev ... the director of
the Kief Imperial Theatre."
"Orders from the General Staff,
Your Imperial Highness!"
"You will, of course,
honor us with your company?"
The new Headquarters.
HIS MAJESTY THE CZAR
WILL VISIT YOUR HEADQUARTERS ...
... THIS AFTERNOON
TO INSPECT THE TROOPS
"Recall a division
from the front ...
... His Majesty thinks
the war is a parlor game."
"We can't spare a division...
we need every man!"
"Don't argue! Have a division
deloused and re-equipped...
and send it here immediately!"
And so, with the flames
of war crackling along ...
... a two-thousand mile front,
troops bitterly needed ...
... to defend Russia
played parade for the Czar.
"Your Imperial Highness,
you are urgently needed
to dispatch instructions!"
"The show will be over
in a minute!"
"Russia relies on you,
dear cousin."
After a week ... after thousands
of men had spilled their blood...
... to defend a few inches of earth ...
there came a lull between storms.
"Where is the lady?"
"I beg you to accept this
expession of gratitude
for your company."
"That sort of thing
should always be done
after caviar!"
"The General Staff,
Your Imperial Highness!"
"Hiss Majesty plans to visit
the front tomorrow! ...
... It might be advisable
to stage an offensive for him ...
... in the morning ...
not too early!"
"My troops are not prepared
for an offensive! ...
... I will not sacrifice them
merely for the entertainment
of the Czar!"
"That's what provides
fuel for the revolution!"
"Can't you see the man
is very ill?"
"I'll show you dirty
revolutionary dogs!"
"Aren't you taking a
terrific risk in defying
the Czar's wishes?"
"I would take any risk
to prevent a needless
sacrifice."
"Then why do you continue
this stupid war?"
"We must have victory! ...
... Defeat means revolution ...
and the collapse of Russia!"
"Then you love Russia
so much?"
"I would gladly die tonight ...
if it would help Russia!"
"Before you die ... won't
you at least have coffee
with me ... in my room?"
"You are very beautiful!
One could easily fall in
love with you!"
"Your hand is trembling!"
"Will you get me my
cigarettes, please?
Yours are so strong!"
"Why didn't you shoot?"
"I don't know why
I didn't kill you ..."
"... I suppose it was because
I couldn't kill ... anyone ...
... who loves Russia
as much as you do!"
"From now on you are
my prisoner of war ..."
"... and my prisoner
of love."
A group of obscure
people meet to decide
the fate of Russia.
"Train Number 476, carrying
the Grand Duke Sergius Alexander ...
... and staff, has left
for the front!"
"Communicate with our agents
at once! Tonight Russia
becomes a republic!"
"If we get the right news
at the next station ...
... His Imperial Highness
will long remember this ride!"
"His Imperial Highness will be
here in five minutes! ...
... Let's give him the greatest
reception he has ever had!"
"All out, Masters of Russia!
Last stop!"
"People of Russia... you are
being led by traitors!"
"We have been slaves
too long! Now we are
the masters!"
"I'll be your servant
just once more! ...
... I'll place the noose
around your neck myself!"
"This is the end,
Your Imperial Highness ...
... It is our turn now!"
"Let's hang him in Petrograd...
for all the world to see!"
"Look at him! ...
The greatest man in Russia...
... greatest even than
the Czar!"
"Make him sweat
as we have sweated! ...
... Make him stoke
our train to Petrograd!"
"Would His Imperial Highness
care for one of his cigarettes?"
"To the locomotive!"
"That woman belongs to me ...
she goes with the coat!"
"Don't you understand?
It was the only way
I could save your life."
"I love you!"
"These pearls will pay
your way out of Russia!"
"I love you!  I love you!"
And so the backwash
of a tortured nation ...
... had carried still
another extra to Hollywood.
"Get the extra people
on the stage!"
"The director has an important
part for you, Pop. You've got
to look nice!"
"Is that beard supposed to
be Russian? It looks like
an ad for cough drops!"
"In Russia, that was worn
on the left side. I know
because I was a general."
"I've made twenty Russian
pictures. You can't tell
me anything about Russia!"
"Get me a whip!"
"I have waited ten years
for this moment, Your
Imperial Highness."
"The same coat, the same
uniform, the same man ...
... only the times
have changed!"
"This is supposed to be
a trench scene of troops
just before a battle ..."
"You are the General
in command!"
"The troops are tired of war ...
tired of listening to
our pretty speeches ..."
"One of them becomes violent ...
you strike him with this whip!"
"We won't have to
rehearse that scene ...
I know you can use a whip!"
"Music please ... the
Russian National Anthem."
"Wind machine!"
"Lights!"
"Camera!"
"What's the difference who wins
this war? ... We're sick and
tired of fighting ..."
"You've given your last command!
A new day is here!
Down with your Russia!
"People of Russia, you are
being led by traitors ...
... we must win
or Russia will perish!"
"The command is forward ...
to victory ..."
"Long Live Russia!"
"Have we won?"
"Yes, Your Imperial Highness ...
you have won!"
"Tough luck! That guy
was a great actor."
"He was more than a
great actor ... he was
a great man."
