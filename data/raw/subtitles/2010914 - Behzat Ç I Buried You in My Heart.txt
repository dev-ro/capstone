Father! Father!
Father!
Father!
Behzat, what is it?
Was it a nightmare?
I must go now...
I must go.
What?
- I must go.
- Where do you need to go?
Where are you going
at this time, Behzat?
Where?
- What are you doing?
- Let go!
BEHZAT Ç.
I BURIED YOU IN MY HEART
Hi, guys! What's going on?
The homicide squad has received
a notice from a lunatic...
...saying that he's buried a coffin...
We are looking for it.
- Yes, I know! Is there anything?
- Negative, Commissioner.
Boys, take it seriously.
Look all around the place.
Especially for scratched surfaces!
It must be somewhere here
but I don't know exactly.
Who does?
Brother Osman may.
Where is he?
Here. He was great!
He has taught me this job.
He had 5000 graves.
Now it's my destiny
to open his grave.
Many people were buried here.
There's a living Ankara there
and there's one buried here.
I've stopped.
Smoking is unhealthy anyway.
I've stopped too.
Tell me at least your name,
brother.
What are you doing?
Where are you from?
I am... a lonesome cowboy,
far away from home.
Where are the fishes?
You fearless bastards!
He has for sure, Father Hayri.
As we were tidying up the room,
...we went to the toilet with Pembo.
That's probably when.
Have you taken the fishes?
Hm?
Why do you hit me?
You bastard!
I swear we have not taken
them, Father Hayri.
Fuck off!
Get out!
Brother, there is something very important.
There are new cars
...being bought. Tell Commander Tahsin to get
us two of them. What's the big deal? Huh?
Do you remember the deviant
who called himself Red Kid?
Looks like he's a real wacko!
He called and said that
he has buried a coffin.
But the local police
didn't take him seriously.
Then Akbaba came and dug
everywhere and saw that the plants
...were separated from the earth
and has called an excavator.
And that was it...
You're saying you've
hidden the fishes?
Somewhere in the home?
Boy, time is running out.
Where are they?
Tell me of I fuck you hard
you son of a bitch.
Say it!
Speak!
I'll break your fingers.
Say it! Speak!
Asphyxia!
What is this, man?
She died from lack of oxygen.
She died while
she was conscious, right?
What you're saying, man?
- I mean, she was buried alive.
- Looks like so.
Why is it still here?
Who owns this car? What is
it doing in our crime scene?
Can't you do anything right? How am
I supposed to get the tire tracks?
You do your crime scene, girl.
I know my own tracks.
Get this car out of here! And you
get out of that grave. Out, out!
Who is this?
Crime scene investigator.
She is new. She has made
her education abroad.
She'll be talking a lot.
Go easy on her.
Get the car out of here!
Cevdet! Gather the people in
front of the opera door...
and check the security tapes.
Yes, sir!
Hayalet, you find out from where
the coffin was taken from.
The coffin?
Yes, darn, the coffin!
OK, brother.
Who?
Necmiye Karapinar, 1937, Ankara.
Got a light, man?
Don't smoke at the scene!
Commissioner, the woman was the mother
of a policeman; Memduh Karapinar.
...Memduh Karapinar.
Memduh Karapinar, retired
from traffic... Uhm...
- Averell!
- Averell Memduh, brother!
Just like a café for retired people.
Behzat!
Our condolences, brother.
Thank you.
Brother Memduh is not there?
He shows the apartment
to the CSI people.
What do you think of this case?
I've heard about a buried dog.
Anything to do with this?
We are working on the matter, bro.
We'll let you know if we find something.
Behzat! Don't do that!
If something happens,
we are going to hear it anyway.
I'll go check Brother Memduh.
When the bell rang,
she opened the door, obviously.
Brother Memduh.
Heartfelt condolences, brother.
- You got the case?
- Yes.
Why is the house so empty?
The furniture is gone.
The bastards have taken everything.
We are four siblings.
My mother loved me the most.
We talked on the phone
yesterday evening.
“I've cooked, come eat.” she said.
I said I'll come back tomorrow.
Did she have any enemies?
With whom a 75 year old woman
be enemies?
You're right...
But I just wonder...
This doesn't just make sense.
But you know, old women can be
pretty moody at 75.
My condolences.
Can I come in?
Yea...
What is this, girl?
Photos from the scene and the list of
the objects we sent to the laboratory.
You didn't have
to bring them here, girl.
Our boys would have
picked them from you.
This case does not affect you at all?
The mother of a policeman
was killed and you sit here...
...and drink vodka.
With this special cup.
Oh!
Take this now, girl.
Get out and close the door.
Cevdet!
What happened, sir?
Is this a hostel?
How do you let everybody in!
But boss, you were the one
who said that I should let everyone in.
You will not! And this girl, not at all!
She's crazy, man! Crazy, crazy!
Behzat! Behzat, get up, get up!
Come on, hurry, hurry!
- What is it, man?
- The Chief calls for us.
He is waiting for us in his room.
Come on, come on!
Like he has ever done it otherwise.
Hello! I've buried a coffin
in Gençlik Park?.
There's a mother in the coffin.
You have not much time.
So? What do you say?
Why does this man
who calls himself Red Kid...
...doesn't just say “somebody”?
Why does he say “a mother”?
We don't know.
Investigate the matter
thoroughly, Behzat.
Find out whether Memduh
Karapinar has enemies.
We have heard from a buried dog.
What is it?
THREE DAYS BEFORE
Hello, yes?
I hear? Red Kid?
Pleased to meet you,
my name is Phantom.
What kind of dog?
Why do you call homicide?
Don't talk to me with that erotic voice.
If you want to piss someone,
then call emergency ? this is homicide.
What's up?
What a jerk! He says he buried
a dog in Altin Park.
He has buried a dog?
Should I go and see?
No, man!
He's probably just a wanker.
- What's up, man?
- Nothing! Only an idiot...
Saying that we should go and
check out the dog he buried in Altin Park.
So, Chief... We are all...
Tahsin! I know all about this.
Tell me what you have in your hand.
We will solve the case, Chief.
Catch this jerk and find the dog.
Yes, sir.
Oh God, oh God! A mouse, a rat,
a tube like an elephant...
The dog is still missing.
Akbaba!
Can you find it?
Looks like it was buried
a long time ago.
This can take time.
Brother, actually, we have to invent
a device with which you can...
...see beneath the earth.
Then we would simply...
- They already have.
- Say what?
Yes. The underground tomography
was developed by TUBITAK-MIC.
TUBITAK what?
MIC. Marmara Investigation Center.
In this country you never know
who digs where.
It was designed to protect the gas lines.
A genuine Turkish invention.
Was last used during
the Ergenekon case...
...in order to find buried weapons.
Just ask for it.
Chief!
That would be a very smart move.
Let's ask TUBITAK.
They should send it.
No, boss, we don't need.
I am here.
Akbaba, you're manual.
We are in the age of digital technology,
we need something.
You are old and stubborn. Go away!
What are you doing here?
Stop talking shit, man.
Hello, hello!
My name is Ahmet.
Ahmet Armless. Look!
Hi.
Ahmet.
Ahmet Armless, hello!
I bet it's Süleyman. He has strong
connections with the organization.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Ahmet. Ahmet Armless.
Look!
I have nothing to do with
this anyway. So, bye!
Süleyman, how are you?
Would you like some tea?
My name is not Süleyman.
My name is Ahmet, Ahmet Armless.
You are Süleyman, you bastard.
Cut it out! Everybody knows
that you're Süleyman.
Read this!
It says Süleyman.
Süleyman Sari Here!
Ahmet, Ahmet Armless.
Fucking with a policeman?
Come here!
Give me that! Give it to me!
What about him?
Commissioner, this guy is crazy.
He goes insane...
...when you call him Süleyman and
gets happy when you call him Ahmet.
- S... S... S as in Süleyman.
- Give it to me, man!
That is Ahmet Armless!
What the fuck! What limp!
It says Süleyman Sari Can't you read?
On the ground, man!
Face down!
OK, OK!
What does it say?
It says Ahmet, man.
Ahmet is here! Ahmet, Ahmet!
Read my name! What's my name?
Ahmet! Limp.
Ahmet Armless!
OK, Ahmet.
Calm down, Ahmet!
He pissed me off!
Calm down, Ahmet. Don't get upset!
You come here often?
Yes, of course.
I have many birds in this park.
I have many animals here.
There was a bird nest.
I have nothing to do with the matter.
My left arm is missing, can't you see!
Hold this for me. Hold it!
Stop!
Cevdet, take Ahmet with you.
Let me say something.
This man could be a spy.
I'm just saying.
So you know!
Moron!
Come, Brother Ahmet, come on!
Did you hear that?
What did he say to me?
Take this, moron, he said.
Father...
Father!
What is it?
What? Brother, what is it?
Father...
Brother...
Father!
Brother, wait, what's going on?
What's going on?
My daughter is there...
Where, brother? Show her to me!
Where's your daughter?
She said father!
Stop it, brother!
It just didn't happen.
Brother, look at me!
Please, don't start again, for God's sake.
We are having a stressful day,
both of us.
But I'm not having alcohol but hey,
what about a few drinks after work?
Piss off, man! You don't know shit.
My daughter was here.
She called me father...
I've searched for the truck and
talked to some people.
I think of something but...
Do you remember the times
they were blocking...
...buildings' entrances with trucks
and rob them?
Could be something like that.
Noone has neighbors anymore.
That's the only reason
why such things happen.
So, check it out.
OK, brother.
The real problem is not
how they did it. That is easy.
Let's say this Red Kid has
a problem with Memduh.
But why he buries his mother?
Maybe he had a problem
with the mother?
Then he wouldn't say
“I've buried a mother”.
Yeah, right. Then he has
a problem with Averell.
Then why did he bury the dog?
If we proceed with this logic, then
the dog has a problem with puppies.
Harun, with this logic,
you go nowhere.
Take the salad, go to the
kitchen and get a doggy bag.
OK, brother.
What have you achieved,
you've found the coffin?
Brother,
this is what happened:
I went to a coffin-maker
I've met before.
He has given up his job
and now makes cradles.
The municipality
gives coffins away now.
The poor man, under these conditions,
has nothing better to do.
And?
That's it, brother.
Hayalet, find out where this
coffin comes from. Find it!
OK, brother.
Huh.
Brother, Akbaba has found the dog.
How did he find it?
He plugged himself to an electric
pole, illuminated the entire park...
...and then dug the damn place.
How, man?
He has dug all by himself?
Yes, he fucked the park.
Well, OK, man, OK.
These were used to protect
the ground from collapsing.
Kind of primitive coffin.
Yea.
Boss, can I have a word
with you in private?
In private.
Brother, this Red Kid dude has a
problem with me. He has it in for me.
Huh?
He buries a dog, he buries people
alive. He wants me to find them.
He calls homicide, brother.
Maybe he knows me?
He has it in for me, you know?
OK, man, OK! Calm down!
You've dug all night.
Now go home, OK, boy?
Wash your hands, wash your face.
Don't think of such nonsense.
Do you understand me, man?
Come to yourself!
Drink lots of beer. OK, man, go, go!
- Brother!
- Yea.
- I know this dog.
- How do you know him, man?
That was the dog
of our commando unit.
As he grew older, they took him
into the garden of moral education center.
- That's Rin Tin Tin.
- Rin Tin Tin. Red Kid, Averell...
What is this fucking thing?
Boss, the madman has spoken.
- Madman?
- What's going on here?
Tell it, brother! You said you saw
it and they were three.
Süleyman has planted the bomb.
It has nothing to do with me.
I have only one arm, don't you see?
You make a mistake.
I live with my mother,
I am a family man.
I gave in my self-criticism
because I only have one arm.
Fuck you, man. Fuck your hands
and fuck your feet!
Shut the fuck up y'all!
On Friday morning, a black and
white truck arrived to Altin Park.
And?
So on Friday morning, a black
and white truck arrived to Altin Park.
Then they got out of the car.
They were three.
Then they set up a sign saying
something on the stand of...
..."We plant flowers." or something.
Then they have unloaded a crate...
...and they placed it in the pit...
...previously prepared.
One of them had a spot on the head.
They were calling him Gorbachev.
The second was chewing a gum
all the time.
They called him Pembo.
And the other one...
He was giving orders to the others.
Friday morning,
black and white truck.
Tell me! And then?
Yes, I will tell all.
Have you talked to them?
If so, what are their names?
Or anyone else was there?
Brand or licence plate of the truck?
Give us decent information!
Yes, I will tell all. I want to tell
but you don't listen to me.
But if you absolutely want me to tell,
I'll tell. So they were three.
One of these...
Terrorist Süleyman.
One, two, three.
They planted the bomb
in the toilet of the cafe.
And this Süleyman guy has triggered
the bomb with his left hand...
Man, throw the bomb at last!
Throw it away at last!
Come back to the truck.
You said they were three.
One had a spot on his head.
Gorbachev.
And the other had a piece of gum
in his mouth. Pembo.
Who is the third?
Was Red Kid giving the orders?
OK, I'll tell you everything.
No worries. I'll tell everything.
But you don't get mad.
Sit down, sit down!
And...
So, he was serving the DHKP-C.
Then he saw that he was
not doing well there...
...so he went to the
Turkish Communist Party.
There, he was not happy and so
he founded the IBDA-C.
Süleyman the terrorist.
Then he went to become
a Jehova's witness.
One more thing...
This Red Kid.
I almost forgot.
I remember now.
A very important detail!
Come nearer.
Red Kid was a Marxist idealist.
Booh!
Boo-hoo!
Chief, this must remain between us.
You're the only one who knows.
If someone hears, I lose my job.
What did you say this
policeman was called?
Averell Memduh.
Memduh?
Memduh Karapinar.
Karapinar...
Hayri Karapinar...
And?
Ahmet Kararl?..
And?
- Not here.
- What do you mean?
- Someone must have taken it.
- How come, man?
I don't know.
How do you not know?
Where is his record?
Let's check the database.
It might have been transferred there.
Go for it!
Fuck! Fuck this!
Eda, Memduh Karapinar‘s records
have been deleted.
Have you made the
social security query?
Yes, boss. He is retired
from the Ministry of Education.
Ministry of Education?
He has also worked as a teacher?
Man, wait a minute! Check whether
he was at court at some point or not.
Yes, boss.
I got it! I've got them.
I got them!
How, man?
Here. One has a spot on the head.
And the other is a funny guy.
This one.
The kidnappers and the intruders
could be the same people.
The team of Red Kid.
Gorbachev Hasan and Pembo.
They are all ex-convicts anyway.
- And how do we find them?
- I know how. Let's go!
Behzat!
Yea!
Behzat, what is it?
Is there anything?
Chief is constantly
asking questions.
No, man. We are in the process.
Tahsin get us that underground thingy...
Tomography.
Yea, tomography. Let's try it!
Why? Haven't you found the dog yet?
Why do you want the device?
I'll stick it in my butt, Tahsin.
I want to see myself inside out.
OK, friends...
Anything else in mind?
I do, Chief. Could we have two of
these newly bought cars for homicide?
Here!
Where's that darn street?
I don't know. We're still looking.
The new cars have a navigation
systems. If we had one...
...we would have found right away.
Boy, keep driving. Go straight
from the right hand side.
Who needs navigation?
Navigation makes radiation.
I have an internal navigation system.
Look! There's a guy waiting.
We're there.
Commissioner why did you hit me?
What have I done to you?
Nothing, your mere
presence is sufficient.
My presence is at your service,
Commissioner. Just ask!
Whom do you seek?
Boy, do you happen to know
two guys known as Gorbachev Hasan...
- ...and Pembo? Where they are...
- I don't know, Commissioner.
Tell me the truth!
If you lie to me I fuck you.
Where are they? Where?
Over there. Ask for Bastard Ertan.
He might know the guys.
Brothers, I must go. Cover for me!
Walk, man!
There he is.
Stop, you bastard!
Man, we ran around the world.
But if I catch you... You bastard!
Run, man!
You got beat or what!
Bastard, come on man, come here!
Come on, man!
Move! Move!
Move!
Where is he, man?
How should I know?
Yes, Akbaba?
What?
What is it, man?
Boy, Red Kid called. He says
he buried a father in Kurtuluş Park.
We don't have much time.
Go, go!
We have gathered all the people
in the park. No journalists.
We are scanning the whole park.
Around the pool.
Not anywhere else.
How do you know, man?
I just know, I know. He certainly
has him buried there.
K9, come with us!
Tahsin!
Yes?
What about this underground thing?
A warm welcome, very pleased.
- Thank you.
- This way.
Where is the device?
Here.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
Where is the object
you are looking for?
We hope
that you're going to tell us.
We can't scan everywhere.
Narrow down the perimeter.
Around the pool!
Are you also from TÜBITAK?
No, I left school
when I was in 2nd grade.
This thing you are looking for,
is it a triangular prism on a square prism?
We are not looking for a prism,
we are looking for a coffin.
A coffin, in theory, is a triangular
prism on a square prism, right?
Madam, find us the coffin,
and we'll discuss the theory later.
OK, OK, I need some silence now!
Silence, y'all! Silence!
Tell them to turn off the fountain.
Right away.
Here it is.
Is this our pool?
Well, this place corresponds
to what point here?
39 degrees, 55 minutes, 28 seconds
North and 32 degrees, 51 minutes,
45 seconds East.
I understand. Well, these coordinates
correspond to where in this park?
A notebook!
Come with a measuring tape!
Draw 7 meters east from here
and 9 meters south from that.
And the meeting point is...
Here!
I told you it was here, man!
By default, a grave is 2 meters long
by 1 meters 10 deep.
If you don't do it like that,
in winter time, dogs and jackals...
...dig right towards the corpse.
What happens then?
The body can't rest.
Were you an MP during
your military service?
Yes. How do you know?
You get things quicker that the rest.
Where did you serve?
The Central Prison in Ulucanlar.
But they moved it elswhere now.
They like to do so.
This is not a city but a building site,
everyone does what he wants.
Straight, straight!
Napoleon, man. Napoleon!
ULUCANLAR CENTRAL PRISON
To the side, man!
Are you the guards for tonight?
Yes, commander.
Where is Napoleon?
Have not seen him, sir.
Have not seen him, sir.
Why are you silent, engineer?
Why are you silent!
Are you the one who took it?
Hamdullah Özdal, 1932, Ankara.
Bro?
He was the father of Brother Coskun,
from the passports office.
I'm wrong, Cenk?
Tell me if I'm wrong!
OK, you're right.
But calm down now.
How can I calm myself down?
Whatever he has in mind,
he should do it to us.
Not our mothers and fathers, man!
Shush... OK.
Good day.
What are you doing here?
What about the link between the dog
in Altin Park and this?
Why didn't you say anything about it?
I hate you!
I hate your guts!
The last event shows us that
there's an organization behind this case.
They're out get the families of the
members of the police force.
Share all records and evidences
with your new colleagues...
...from the special team.
We must work together
from now on.
Yes, sir.
But... Sir, we have made significant
progress on the case...
...the perpetrators are identified.
We can do the job.
Chief Commissioner...
One more person has died.
What perpetrators
are you talking about!
We could have solved the case
long ago. But someone...
...has stolen from the archives.
Really?
I didn't know about that.
But I'll deal with it.
And this Red Kid calls
homicide directly.
Had he called the municipal police,
would they have bothered?
Yes, Songül, what do you suggest?
Sir, because of its connection
to organized crimes...
...a coordinated approach would be
the correct choice. Sir.
Let's not fool around...
Behzat, I want this case closed
as soon as possible.
What do you think you're doing?
Let go of my arm!
You've screwed up everything.
I've screwed up everything?
Before you accuse me, read my reports.
We have found lots of evidence
at the scene. Have you followed any?
What are you, bully or policeman?
We could have prevented the second
murder if you listened to me.
Listened? To you? This case
can't be solved with fluff?
So tell us how!
You must first find the
cause of the murder.
- That you need to find. Did you?
- I did.
Then tell us. The cause of murder.
Clock.
What clock?
The parents of a boy were killed.
He grows up and takes revenge.
By whom?
By the police,
who killed his parents.
Oh come on, how could
they kill his parents?
One of them was from traffic and the
other from the passport office.
This is something that
happened in the 90's.
What these men have done
at that time is questionable.
We know that they were working
at the traffic department...
...and the passport office,
but that doesn't mean anything.
They retired
from other departments anyway.
Thanks Hidayet.
This team, which was founded
in order to be more coordinated...
...tried to cover up this case.
All files and data on these men
have already been destroyed.
This wouldn't have been possible
if they were not so powerful.
Who?
I don't know. But if this case is
solved, other mysterious cases...
...from the past will come to light too.
Then many men will lose
their good positions.
Why is he burying them?
I don't know.
Why he calls homicide?
I don't know.
There is a lot more than
what you know.
Yes, I know.
What are you doing?
Come here! Come here, man!
I said come!
Did you find out
from where the coffin is from?
Brother, this is what happened:
The municipality is giving
away coffins, right?
So I went to the main office.
I've spoken with a Dracula-like
spoon eared official.
He said that everything was under
his control. And you know what?
He counts the coffins every evening!
And?
And nothing, brother.
Find out where this coffin
comes from. Find it, man!
OK, brother.
I should go now.
Wait, I'll take you home.
OK.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Cool woman!
Don't talk shit, man!
Bears are roaring behind our asses
and you're talking nonsense.
But that doesn't change the fact
that the woman is cool.
Look.
Tastes a bit strange. And it's warm.
Boy, I didn't sleep for two days.
Why not, man?
Boy, this Red Kid has it in for me.
How, man?
He called homicide saying that
he buried a dog.
I didn't pay much attention. And look!
He's burying everybody now.
And?
- Boy, look at the details!
- What details?
- Who are the people he buries?
- Who?
The relatives of retirees.
What is my father? Retired!
He can bury me.
Don't laugh, man!
He can bury me!
I'd break his jaw if he ever tried
to do so! Yet you never know...
....when he comes. You don't
know him. He might see you.
He poisons your beer and you're
dead! Then you get higher than ever.
Thanks.
Don't you want to ask something?
Like what?
Isn't there something about me
that you're curious about?
There is.
You live here?
I live here with my brother.
Come, I'll introduce you.
No, I'm good.
Come, come!
No, that's good, OK!
Why don't you come?
You have it in for me...
...otherwise you would
not mind meeting him.
Don't worry, he is very open minded,
he won't hurt you.
Good evening, Mrs. Songül.
Good evening Gülsüm,
you can go to sleep.
I'll let you know before
I go tomorrow morning.
OK.
Do you want slippers?
No.
Welcome, dad.
Thank you buddy.
Have you bought Muni?
What?
No brother, I've told you many times
before, the factory stopped producing it.
And why not?
They have stopped the production.
What can I do?
But I want it. I want it!
Yes, I want it!
What does he want?
A toy.
He had an accident and
suffered brain damage.
And now he behaves
like a seven year old.
What kind of accident?
Nevermind.
He's my brother and my child.
Would you like a drink?
No...
I should go.
It's getting late.
Finally!
- What's up, man?
- Good, bro.
- How are you?
- Good.
Boy, the door is kaput.
Do you have a beer?
No brother, they give it
on prescription now.
I've heard there is a spinner
who buries people.
How's it going?
We are tuned to the case.
Good, good...
Good, but you don't worry. I don't
want you to suffer from stress again.
I know you'll do your best.
You always have
and you always will, right?
Yea.
Here. Take this.
It's a doctor, a psychiatrist.
I've talked to him about you.
You can call whenever you want, OK?
You can go and tell all your problems.
I don't wanna go to a shrink.
Look how happy I am!
Good, but I've heard
that you hear voices...
...and that you run and jump
up and down in pits.
Oh, come on, bro!
Yea! Of course, man! Oh!
Now stop with this TV!
Listen to your
brother once in a lifetime.
Please call the doctor.
What have you got to lose?
Cut it out now, will you, bro!
All right, man!
You do what you like.
One day, they'll take
you to an asylum...
...and then you'll wait for your
brother to come and save you.
And then you'll weep calling his name...
Brother... Brother...
- Did you ever see me weeping, bro?
- Of course I have!
- I didn't cry!
- You did.
- I didn't!
- You did, man!
Stop yelling!
You're scaring the bunnies!
Boy, you've been feeding a bunny
that doesn't exist for months now.
Stop it, for God's sake.
You're my brother.
I don't want anything bad
happening to you.
If you want, we can go together.
I could be present during your sessions.
Huh? Say yes!
Don't cry!
OK, I'll go.
Cool, bro! Yes!
You're a brother.
Piss off!
Bravo, bravo! But if you don't go,
we get in trouble.
Trust me on this, man.
Gentlemen!
Come!
Here you go, boss.
Thank you, Ceco.
Where is he going?
He walks around in parks,
looking for pits. He's gone crazy.
Huh?
Should we give the man
some days off?
Even if you give,
I don't think he'll take any.
Eda!
What about the judicial
information about Averell Memduh?
Chief, I'm sure that there has been
a lot of trouble regarding this Averell...
Uhm, sorry... about Mr. Memduh
and that everytime it happened...
...it has been decided to
stop the persecutions.
I also checked Mr. Coskun.
He's retired from the land registry.
His files before the court include
the same processes...
...as Memduh Karapinar. I don't know
if it will help but I've reached a lawyer.
Give me his address.
He doesn't want to meet in his office.
How come?
What have you done about
these before?
About two people that have been
kidnapped and shot in Bahçelievler.
What had Averell Memduh
and Coşkun to do with it?
They were suspects but we could
not prove anything.
We had filed an official complaint
to the DA who submitted...
...his own to the ministry.
Two investigators were assigned
to investigate the administrative aspects.
One of them died in a traffic accident.
He was killed.
The other was Fazil Karakaya.
He went further on the case...
...and solved the major part of the case.
He was speaking of a secret
organization within the police.
So, he's been kicked. I don't want
to get involved in this anymore.
These guys are too strong.
Good bye.
Mr. Sadi wants to see you.
Who are you, man?
Secret Service.
Did you delete the data
of these policemen?
Which policemen?
If you talk about Memduh Karapinar
and Coşkun Özdal...
...they have never worked
with the police.
No way!
Chief, in the past,
mistakes have happened.
But the days are over now.
We know you and we like you,
but we have limits too.
Sometimes we need to get rid of
the people we appreciate as well.
Good for you.
Then why don't you do it!
We do our thing, our way.
You stay out of this.
We need to tell everything,
we have no other choice.
You can say that, but...
Fact is,
if you don't do it, I will.
Yes, that would be the best.
He doesn't know about anything.
Then he should know it
and behave accordingly.
You're right, brother. Let's put it to him,
but we must do it secretly.
Oh, welcome!
I'm Ahmet. Ahmet Armless.
What kind of shit is that!
Interviewing a man, releasing him...
...and then letting him
kill 3 more policemen.
You will pay for it.
There is nothing that I can't justify,
Chief. This man is not Red Kid.
How do you know?
Do you think someone could do
something like that just by by himself?
We have arrested the man
with the murder weapon.
What are you talking about?
It's all in his confession.
Let's say he had a problem
with these policemen.
Why did he kill their parents?
Why did he bury the dog?
Did anyone compare the phone
records and the voice of our suspect?
Red Kid is still running around
out there, burying people.
He is a murderer.
And you are burying the truth.
You are murderers.
You come here often?
During summertime.
How long has your brother
been in this state?
Ten years.
He had an accident?
A bullet hit him in the head.
How?
He was a policeman in Istanbul.
Terror?
No, vice squad. It happened
during a nightclub bust.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
I didn't want to announce it.
I didn't want people to think
I take advantage of this.
I don't want to be the daughter
or sister of someone, Behzat.
I want to stand on my own feet.
Who made you so unhappy?
What?
What's your problem?
Why are you so?
Oh, no, I have no problem,
I'm always so.
Shall we go?
Shouldn't we drink another one?
My brother must have slept.
So, today is the day.
You're drunk.
You've been drinking, too.
I always drink. So I can't say
“I was drunk, I don't remember.”
Have you quit your activities?
What activities?
No!
You don't find me beautiful?
You are very beautiful.
What is the problem?
There is no problem.
Can you find it?
What?
Muni!
She went to the factory but they
said it didn't exist anymore.
I will find it.
Promise?
Promised.
Akbaba?
Not gas. Not power.
What is this pit for?
Get up Akbaba, get up! Red Kid
has been arrested, it's over.
Oh, come on Chief, this moron
can't have it all done.
You go ahead. I'll check Güven Park.
He'd better bury his stuff
in front of the police station!
You do your own work.
I must check it anyways.
Otherwise I won't be able
to stop thinking about it.
Akbaba, the force has a resort in Datça.
Get a week off and recover.
Rest now, boy.
I'll have everything arranged.
I sent Akbaba on vacation,
to Haymana.
There, the department
has a very nice guest house.
Should I send you too?
To Polatl?
No, to Datça.
Huh!
Behzat, we got away well.
They could have us all suspended.
The only thing I'm asking you
is not to get involved in this, OK?
Look, I'm not like you.
I mean I'm not independent
as you are. I have two children.
I have to pay for their education.
Look, the new cars are there.
I already had reserved
two of them for you.
Tell your boys to come
and pick them up tomorrow.
OK, Tahsin, OK.
Give us the cars...
...and I stop digging your shit.
OK, agreed.
The only thing missing is an AC.
AC? It's easy. This is a very
good spot for it. OK, I'm on it.
Very nice!
And four Russian women.
Russian women?
I wonder what the vice squad
has to say about it.
Piss off, Tahsin.
Piss off!
How's it going, Bastard Ertan?
Cool, brother. Nice.
Boy, why do you have
the police behind you?
What are you tripping about?
Get up! Get up you two!
You don't. Sit down.
Get up! Get up!
We playing Okey?
OK... Who's turn?
Yours, brother.
Mine?
There you go!
Right!
Commissioner, why are
you hitting me?
Why wouldn't I?
In all honesty! Why wouldn't I?
Am I wrong, huh?
You're right, boss.
Of course I'm right.
Hayalet knows this.
He knows it very well. Modest.
Bastard, but not just a bastard.
A modest bastard.
What are you staring at?
New game, new game!
This is Red Kid speaking.
I've buried a coffin in Gençlik Park.
There's a mother in the coffin.
The guy that thinks he's Ahmet.
That. And this recording.
They need to be compared.
Alright.
And there is an investigator.
Requested by the prosecutors.
Appointed by the ministry.
This man knows everything
about the police.
Who is it?
Fazil Karakaya,
we have to find him.
Consider it done.
How is Hoppa?
Gnaws power cables.
Poor moron.
Stop it!
Wha?
Brother, I found Gorbachev
Hasan and Pembo.
Where are you, man?
You know what? It's good that
we have signed the Kyoto Protocol.
All these industrial gases.
In the atmosphere. That's why it's hot.
Listen to that!
So you think you're that smart, huh!
Say that again and I'll kick your ass.
Just tell me what you really should.
Mr. Commissioner,
this was a little harsh.
It surely had to be so.
Yes, Cevdet. There are gases.
But that's not surely my fault.
Whose fault was it?
It was America's.
Did they sign for that protocol?
They didn't.
Then this subject is over.
Stop eating the best ones.
Leave us some nuts, OK?
Enough. Good.
Where are they?
Bastard Ertan told them
to come here.
Where is that bastard?
This animal has beaten him
with the Okey board.
We took him to the hospital.
Well done.
He made us run like animals.
What is it,
what are you looking at?
Just get me a beer, man!
Yo, get us a beer!
They are there.
Good mood here.
Cevdet. Get us a light, will you.
I don't smoke, boss.
Then you should start!
Cevdet don't panic. Keep cool.
You are homicide.
Operation Horny Rabbit starts.
You too, ho, go!
Excuse me. Got a light?
So you provoking me, huh?
What's going on, bro?
Are you Gorbachev Hasan?
Which Hasan?
Whoops!
Are you Gorbachev Hasan?
I am, dude.
And you are the gay who
calls himself Pembo?
I am Pembo.
But you are the gay one.
Come over here!
If you curse again, I fuck you!
What the hell! Who the fuck you
think you're dealing with?
Walk!
What's the theme?
No theme!
Walk!
I don't understand.
Hasan? What do you say
about global warming?
Commissioner, so forth,
I'm taking care of my affairs.
I don't have the luxury
to think about these things.
What an original comment. What
do you say about the Kyoto Protocol?
What?
The Kyoto! Kyoto, Kyoto!
Kyoto... Bro, I'm a nationalist
supporter of Atatürk.
Damn you, boy! If you're a nationalist
follower of Atatürk...
...how come you rob people by parking
your truck in front of their apartments?
You dog!
Anyway, let's get to our actual topic.
Let's get to the actual topic.
Huh!
Speak!
About what?
Shut up!
Fuck you! Speak!
Should I keep my mouth shut
or speak?
- Speak!
- About what, brother?
You just start.
I will show you the direction.
I was born in 1974 in Malatya.
Fuck you!
Are you fucking with me?
What if I just took this pepper
spray and use it on your eye balls?
And I tie your hands and feet firmly
and put you in a coffin.
And I bury the coffin.
What happens?
Nothing happens!
The world gets rid of you.
Remember something?
Chief, what am I supposed to
remember? I don't understand.
He doesn't remember.
What should we do?
Bring him to the store.
Check his face. And especially his mouth.
What do you mean by store?
Our free shop.
Just a second. Listen to me!
Chief! A second.
I'm a nationalist. I'm a statist.
I'm a revolutionist. I was raised by the state.
Wait a minute!
I did nothing wrong to the
soldiers and policemen.
Am I Armenian? Greek?
Kurdish? Of the PKK?
Brother, these louts have grown
up in an orphanage.
They're used to get beat up.
They wouldn't confess easily.
So?
We need to come up with
a different method.
Do you really know
a different method?
You, Harun?
They might have used them
for this job and let them go...
...so we can catch them.
Otherwise, I would have
found them in the first place.
Oops!
What?
Nothing!
Seems they had it hidden.
Pembo had 5000 ? in his pocket.
The other had 4900.
What has he done with the 100?
Gave it to a Russian woman.
Son of a bitch.
Chief, should I take the other?
- Yes, yes.
- Come on, man! Walk!
Sit down. Here!
Why do they call you Pembo?
In our times it was a chewing gum
brand. I chewed it all the time.
They don't make it anymore.
So what do you chew these times?
I chew Dentist now. Although
it's not the same thing, it's OK.
Is there something you want
to tell us, Dentist?
No.
And if I fuck you,
would you think of something?
Don't you curse, asshole!
Fuck you
and fuck your eye balls!
How you dare to speak like this
to a policeman this state?
Fuck your government and
fuck the police!
What has this state given me so far?
What, man? Endless beatings.
You think I'm scared of you?
Get up, man! Stand up! Stand up!
What's going on here?
Nothing, Chief. This Red Kid
we have arrested is not the real one.
And these are the accomplices
of the real Red Kid.
We are tuned to the case.
We'll keep pushing.
Who told you that you should
arrest these?
No one. We did what we had to do.
That's it!
No, that is not it!
There is no such case.
And if there was,
then it's closed.
By whom?
By me. Any objections?
Get him out!
You sons of bitches!
Shut up, man!
Listen, Behzat.
I warn you for the last time, OK?
Who do you think you are?
I'll erase you!
Do you hear me, I'll erase you!
We're going,
if you don't need anything else.
Piss off!
You stay here, Hayalet.
What about the coffin?
You've found it?
Brother, this is what happened:
Since I could not get anything
from the office of cemeteries...
...I've been on all the cemeteries.
Cebeci, Karsiyaka, etc.
I talked to everybody.
They said they didn't register
the coffins and therefore...
...can't tell if one is missing.
And?
Brother, ask me to find somebody
who's alive. And I will.
Ask for a bird, ask for a dog.
As long as it's breathing
it's OK with me.
But how can I find a coffin?
I don't care! Find it!
OK, brother.
Brother...
I want to tell you something.
Tell me what?
Brother, this Red Kid
has it in for me.
Wha?
Brother, this guy buries
people in a coffin.
And how does he bury people?
Alive, brother. So people are still living.
And you know, I have a
reputation for finding people.
When it comes to finding someone,
Hayalet turns everything upside down...
...and does it, brother.
I think he might be trying to
give me a message?
I'm looking for a coffin for days now.
Perhaps I am looking for...
...my own coffin, brother?
I can't sleep, you know.
I've become a real psychopath.
Drink this, man!
It burned, brother.
You have to take this five times daily.
Once in the morning, once at noon...
...and three at night.
Then it is good.
I can arrange that.
Yea.
Yea.
This is not a good way
to pick up the phone.
Yea.
I have found the investigator
you were talking about.
Huh, nice. What's his address?
He doesn't want to meet in his place.
Huh.
They have gathered
different units of the police...
...and established an execution unit.
None of their activities are legal.
They have used weapons
of various organizations.
Each case was presented
as an intra-organizational action.
And when the prosecution has
demanded an administrative inquiry...
...by the ministry, I and Şevki
the deceased were commissioned.
The ministry didn't expect
that we could solve the case.
They have suspended us from duty
and covered things up.
Those who founded this organization
in 1993, are now in key positions.
They have suspended us
before we got to them.
These men have covered up everything
in order not to lose their status.
This is Ankara.
You are nothing without status.
How does Red Kid know of such
a secret organization?
Have you told him?
I've kidnapped your daughter, he said.
The Daltons are four, right?
Yes.
And?
Look at this. Although it was dug
with an excavator, the bottom is...
...straight like a razor.
Same as the dog's.
2 meters long by 1 meters 10 deep.
These are standard dimensions
for graves. This could be a pro.
Bravo, girl. Bravo. You've done
your homework.
But I quit.
Why?
I don't want people to keep dying.
What about the ones that are
already dead? Everything is so simple?
Is this thing only simple
mathematics to you?
Then you're no different
from the others.
Maybe! But you're young, you have
to grow and achieve good positions.
Then they will notice your difference.
This crime scene girl...
Anything between you two?
How do you know?
I've noticed it on the first day,
when there was nothing between you.
It's not like that.
It's here.
In the name of God, it's here.
Who's there?
Berna.
Berna is dead.
Berna is alive, boss.
Your daughter is alive.
We have not told you.
Why didn't you tell me, punk!
We wanted to make you birthday
a surprise. Berna lives!
When I heard the news,
I ran back from Haymana!
Right here!
Behzat, what is it? A nightmare?
I must go... Must go.
What?
What, Boss?
Why are we here?
Red Kid buried Berna.
Right here. I've seen it.
That's impossible.
Berna is dead.
- Akbaba says she's not.
- Where have you seen Akbaba?
He came as soon as he heard it.
Brother, there is no such thing.
You had a nightmare. Stop it.
Brother, I have found the coffin.
It's here. At the back.
Behzat, what is it?
A nightmare?
Red Kid has it in for me.
He'll bury Berna.
Behzat, Berna is dead.
No, she is not dead, not dead...
I had a nightmare. I dreamed that...
...I woke up from a nightmare.
You were next to me.
That was a nightmare.
Nothing changes, nothing.
This is you, right?
I'm here, Behzat!
Red Kid will bury Berna.
Nothing will happen, Behzat.
Wait until tomorrow,
then everything is over.
I have to find Red Kid.
Boys, this is a favor from me. But you
must listen to what I have to say.
OK, boss, OK. The thing
about Red Kid is completed.
God will punish him! We forgot it.
These cars belong to us now, right?
Yes. But you listen to me now.
You have to take care of these cars!
Drive carefully!
When you drive over holes and
speedbumps, you're going to have to...
...slow down. Don't scratch
the paint... Just pay attention!
A good car, a very
good car, brother.
Look, from 0 to 100
in 10 seconds. See?
15!
But don't you let this fool you.
I'm still not used to the car, that's all!
And it has a five star security test.
If we were going to crash it...
...four airbags would blow.
One at the side, one at the front.
For each of us!
Good! Now crash the car and
we'll see if they really work.
Speed, quality, security. Everything.
The previous one was crap.
Stop the car!
Boss. Please. Don't.
Stop the car!
Brother, there is nothing there!
Berna!
Dad!
My child!
I've told everyone but nobody
believed me. Hold me Berna!
Hold me, my child!
Daddy, where were you?
I've been waiting for you.
Nothing will tear us apart, Berna.
Never again.
Let my daughter go!
Madame...
Let my daughter go!
Lady... He means no harm.
He's an officer from homicide.
Brother, this is not your daughter.
Let go, brother! Brother!
Let go, it's not your daughter!
Brother, I learned where
the coffin was from.
Brother Satilmis, tell us who
got these coffins from you.
A boy was hanging around here
for the last two months.
Hanging around?
He has learned how to dig a grave.
He was looking for his parents' graves.
All I know is that he told he was
a lonesome cowboy...
...and that he quit smoking.
It's not healthy anyway...
What's his name?
I don't know.
Was anybody with him?
There were two other men. From
a transport company called Düldül.
Called what?
Düldül!
That was the horse of Prophet Ali.
They took the coffins.
How many coffins they have taken?
Two. Three.
I fixed the toilet with two others.
Now I have five coffins.
We don't need much coffins here.
He'll bury somebody again.
Brother Satilmis we need two coffins.
One moment, Mr. Commissioner,
if you allow me, I want to say something.
We don't know what is
the name of the man.
God will punish me if I lie.
He has given us 1000 ? each.
We thought it was regular transport work.
Fuck you're lying.
In a fucking grave.
Don't curse, you bastard.
Shut up! Lie down!
Shut the lids and cover them!
Brother, it's been 10 minutes.
What do we do?
How is the underground reception?
Fucking ads tell that there's
reception everywhere. We'll see.
Chief, I'm telling you.
In the name of God and the prophet!
He has given us 5000 ? each.
We were in the orphanage together.
His name is Emin. Emin Altinkaya.
He is an engineer
in a washing machine factory.
Get me outta here.
I've given you the name.
Why do you bury me?
Am I Greek? Armenian?
From the PKK? Kurdish?
Be quiet, man! Quiet!
Who is the third?
The third? There's nobody else.
He told us only about two.
I don't know any third. In the name
of God and the prophet!
Get me outta here, brother.
Emin. Altinkaya.
Emin? Who is it?
Red Kid.
Who is he going to bury now?
Who's the third?
You asshole! When I get out here,
I'll fuck your mother and your wife.
What happened? Do you think
I'm scared! You son of a bitch!
Wha?
Brother, I'm Gorbachev Hasan.
I got your number from the callers' list.
I don't know who the third is.
Why should I hide it anyway?
I swear! I really don't know.
I'll do anything, Commissioner,
get me out of here.
Brother, they would have told us
if they knew. What are we doing?
This is insane.
This is nothing like us.
I don't know what kind of grass
this Satilmis dude gave you...
...but still, that's not the way
to do things.
Truly, brother.
It's not really worth it.
They'll die.
Let's call again.
Commissioner, my battery is low...
I don't know! I don't know...
They don't know.
Pembo! Brother!
Have you ratted us, man?
You told it, right?
I'll polish your bald head
when we're done with this.
Wow, how pathetic, you moron!
You psychopath! What could I do?
They've buried us alive.
I felt my lungs in my mouth.
If Gorbachev would have
been a real man...
...Russia wouldn't be in this state.
What's that,
like man and wife?
Behzat!
We need to make him tell where
he got those firearms from.
We can't solve the case otherwise.
Or someone else will die.
Nothing he's saying sounds
accurate, Behzat.
His name is Süleyman
but he calls himself Ahmet.
How will you get him to talk?
Fake ID.
Thank you for letting me keep my bag.
My ID. Ahmet Armless.
The bomb was placed in the shop
by Süleyman. With his left hand.
I have nothing to do with that.
I didn't do it.
I have no left hand. Look!
The truth?
It was 15 years ago.
I was a student at ODTÜ.
I had a side job in the shop.
By chance, on this day,
I wasn't working.
They took me to the station
and asked why I wasn't working.
I lived with my mother and that day
she was sick. There was no one...
...who could take care of her.
They just didn't listen to me.
They told me I have planted the bomb,
they took me in and...
...then beat me.
They asked me whether I knew
Ahmet Armless or not.
I said I didn't. They hit me,
over and over again.
Then a man has come.
He said...
...I planned this
with Ahmet Armless.
I said I didn't know Ahmet Armless.
He has beaten me. Again.
He said I knew Ahmet Armless.
I said I didn't know Ahmet Armless.
He has beaten me again.
Then I said, I am Ahmet Armless
and so I got rid of that man.
Ahmet, who has given you
the weapons?
It was that man.
They called him Titus.
At that time he was chunky.
Had a pair of glasses.
With thick glasses.
I'm Ahmet. Ahmet Armless.
Sadi, the Secret Service.
What?
The man has resigned in the factory
two months ago.
We have checked his address
but he's not there.
Go to Sadi's now. I'll come and
join you there.
He's the only one
who knows the fourth.
Ahmet!
Mr. Commissioner, my name
is not Ahmet Armless.
My name is Süleyman Sari
And my arm is fine.
With all the digital stuff... Nah...
I'm not enjoying any of this anymore.
Less talk, more work.
OK, done. Get lost! Get lost!
Hey, what are you doing, man?
Are you tripping?
You really think you can come and
go here the way you want it to?
Red Kid will bury someone again.
We're trying to find him.
He can bury noone no more.
It's over. Now do what you're expected...
...and then fuck off!
Cut the crap, now.
Nothing's over!
There was somebody other that
Red Kid's parents that was killed.
His revenge is not accomplished yet.
A member of the family of
the fourth person will be buried.
On the ground, on the ground!
Down! Down!
Man, was it you?
I participated to the operations
only as an observer.
What if you knew everything?
Let's say you have everything revealed.
What then?
There are people who
we don't know behind this.
What are you going to do, then?
You will find yourself dead
in the bathroom, you idiot!
Who's the fourth?
Who's the fourth?
Who founded the organization
in the force?
I founded it. The ministry knew
about it. I have also used...
...my own initiative. We have
been fighting against terror, man!
If we hadn't kill them,
we would have lost our homeland.
In whose hands is our homeland
now? We'd better lose it than...
...let it in your hands.
You killed your own investigator, man.
You're talking about a homeland
and you live in this house!
Who gives you this money?
You pimp!
You have reached the end, Sadi.
Remember Süleyman?
The one you've turned into Ahmet?
He's telling everything to the prosecutor.
Nothing will happen to your superior
but you'll lose everything, Sadi.
You stupid cop! You think that just
because a sorry ass mad guy spoke...
...something will happen to me?
Everything's resolved by itself.
Why do you care about a murder
that didn't happen yet?
No dead man, no murder.
No murder, no homicide.
You just don't exist, man.
First they killed our dog.
And then my father.
My mother hid me
in the washing machine.
I knew I had to be quiet.
Then this man came in.
Then the police got me out.
Then I saw my mother, my father...
...and then, my sister.
She was behind the door,
just standing there.
She was so small, you know.
She couldn't grow up...
...because you killed her.
My little sister.
We've buried the body of the girl
and the parents in the cemetery...
...for homeless. Then this fellow
had himself transferred to Istanbul.
I've heard that he was with
the vice squad. Later he took...
...a bullet in the head and
now he is handicapped.
Pick up the phone, Songül!
OK! Brother, back to Güven Park!
He did it. And he gave himself in.
Didn't I tell you, boss? Didn't I!
I told you we should check Güven Park!
Were you not in Haymana?
What Haymana, boss!
I was drinking beer at home.
I've heard the announcement
and I flew.
Where's the car?
Why did you come by taxi?
Don't ask boss.
Don't ask!
What happened to the car?
Fuck the car! Where is he?
The man?
“We should all calm down. I have
finished my work. I gave myself in”
That's what he said.
He doesn't tell where
the coffin is, though.
The only one who's entitled
to go near him is our advisor.
Passage prohibited, boss!
Chief's orders!
What are you doing?
Lock the door, man!
Behzat!
Get him out of there!
Fuck your Red Kid hat.
Wow! The tough men
of the city are here.
Where is the coffin, man?
Boy, the girl is innocent.
She is innocent!
And my sister was innocent.
You killed the parents of these men.
What do you want?
You have uncovered the organization.
You won, man!
I want my sister.
She's dead, man! Dead!
Then one more person has to die!
Don't fuck this up!
If anything happens to this girl,
I'll blow your head off!
Shoot, man!
Do you have the balls to do it?
The men who killed your parents
were not only murderers.
They were perverts! Insane!
The chief of intelligence told me
everything! Want me to tell you, man?
Shut up, man! Shut up!
Shall I tell you
what he told me, man?
Shut up, man! Shut up!
Shall I tell you everything, man?
Shut up, man!
Shall I tell you what the chief
has told me, man?
What to do with your parents...
Calm down of I'll fuck
your ass! Calm down!
You know what they did to your mother
after you were gone?
Do you know how they raped her?
They all raped her!
Where is the coffin, man?
Huh?
Where is the coffin, man?
Tell us, where is the coffin?
Listen, if you tell me where the
coffin is, I'll tell you anything.
Where is the coffin?
Do you know what happened next?
To your sister?
They made her lie down on the table...
Where is the coffin, man?
Where is the coffin! Where, man?
Let go, man! Let go!
The man has buried an officer!
What are you doing, man!
Silence!
I've found it! Stop it!
We're getting close!
Five meters from here...
It's here! In the pool!
Hold it! Right there!
Lift it!
Dead, chief!
Huh, I know.
Boss... Where?
Behzat! Don't do that!
Stop! I'm begging you!
Put the gun down!
Behzat! Down! Please!
I beg you! Down!
Chief!
Are you OK?
Hayalet?
Hey, dude!
How did you get out?
I just opened the door.
The door is stuck, man!
I opened it, man!
Boss!
Brother, we are the police.
Let's go!
