Tommy.
Come on, boy.
Come and get it.
Hey!. There he is.
Turn it down, you fuck!
He´ll hear us.
Come on. Let´s finish
this thing once and for all.
Yeah!
Go!
All right, man!
We´re comin´ to get you, Tommy.
Run! Run!
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!
We´re gonna send you
back to hell, freak!
We got him!
Batter up!
That´s a single!
That´s a double!
That´s a triple, man!
Come on! Come on!
Home run!
String him up!
String him up!
Come here!
All right. String him up.
All right. Let him go.
Oh, boy, you are a swinger!
You are! Come here!
Come here.
Oh, boys, we caught
ourselves a big one!
Hoist him up!
Come on, higher!
Higher!
Well, well, well, boy!
Looks like we got ourselves
a big one, didn´t we?.
And he´s pretty too, isn´t he?.
Isn´t he?.
He´s beautiful!
All right!
Okay, boys,
time to send this freak...
back to hell!
Do it! Do it!
Drop him!
Dirty job,
but someone had to do it.
You know, all I ever wanted to do
when I was growing up
was to get away from this town.
If you told me 20 years ago
that l´d give up the fifth precinct
in New York City for the old
Ferren Woods sheriffs office--
- How´s that uniform fit?.
- Like a glove.
And as for this,
l´m damned happy to say,
that with the exception
of some target practice,
I won´t be using it much.
There.
Now, how about that, huh?.
Oh, Sheriff.
Listen! You hear it?.
What?.
Silence.
Beautiful, peaceful silence.
There´s no traffic,
no pollution, no gangs.
Yeah. You´re right.
But...
What?.
I´m just not sure we made
the right decision moving here.
Jenny´s fine, Beth.
Yeah, what about you?.
All that´s behind us now, huh?.
This is our new home.
This is where we
make our life together.
You know, I don´t think
our daughter quite sees it that way.
Could you please just talk to her?.
Our daughter and I don´t talk.
We debate, remember?.
Jenny will be okay.
Just keep an eye on her.
Make sure she stays clear
of the trouble
she ran into in the city, that´s all.
Hey, man.
Let´s spark that joint.
Light my fire.
Hey! You guys knock it off back there.
You´re gonna stink up the upholstery.
Hey.
Isn´t that the new girl?.
Yeah, she´s kinda cute.
It´s Jenny Braddock.
Her dad´s the new sheriff.
Big fuckin´ deal.
Hey, Jenny. It´s Marcie.
Remember me from trade class?.
Yeah. Hi, Marcie.
Jenny Braddock, l´m Danny.
Danny Dixon.
Let me guess.
You guys are the local
badasses, right?.
That´s right.
Well, no offense,
but l´ve seen a lot badder.
New York City girl.
I like your style, Braddock.
I really truly do.
My name´s Jenny.
My father´s name´s Braddock.
Okay, Jenny.
Can I offer you a ride?.
I don´t know if you´ve noticed,
but the school´s right over there.
Who says we´re goin´ to school?.
Yeah, okay.
I´ll ride with you guys.
All right, let´s do it.
Come on.
You´re my new girl.
- l´m Peter.
- Hi.
- Let´s roll.
- Yeah, yeah, hell, yeah.
You got my huntin´ license ready?.
Yeah. Right here.
It´s ten dollars, please.
Don´t seem fair, the price
of huntin´ goin´ up this year.
Sheriff Longbow
never raised prices.
Costs go up, Slick. Sheriff Braddock´s
got nothing to do with that.
I liked it better before.
And don´t call me Slick.
I didn´t like it in high school
and I still don´t like it.
Name´s Ernst.
Would you believe old Slick and l
we´re the same age.
Used to be best friends
when we were kids.
What a loser.
Looks like this is gonna be
a good huntin´ season, Sheriff.
I wish I could take
credit for that, Judge.
You know, I had a feeling
a local fellow like you
was gonna be the right man
for this job.
You just seem like a man that...
wants to make things work.
See you, Sheriff.
Yeah.
Oh, by the way, your physical´s
scheduled for noon.
Okay, here we go.
Now...
don´t worry, Sheriff.
Dr. Pettibone comes
from a long line of doctors.
Except most of them
studied their medicine
with roots and blackbird beaks
in swamps.
Blackbird beaks, eh?.
- This is cold.
- Okay.
My grandma be the top sorcière in
the whole of the Achala Falaya. Breathe.
What´s a sorcière?.
Witch doctor.
Those are some of her patients
who didn´t pay.
Knock, knock.
Sheriff, Delilah, the mayor´s
ready anytime you are.
Send him in.
Right this way.
Sheriff.
- Mayor.
- Ma´am.
- Hello, Mayor.
- Well, it´s good to see you.
Well, now, I ain´t got time for greetings.
Marie, you got my guitar?.
Sure do.
Here you go, Mayor.
Did you cure it?.
Well, it´s tuned.
Thank you kindly, darlin´.
Well, I gotta bail.
Playin´ a little gig tonight
and l´m runnin´ late.
By the way,
how´s everybody treatin´ you?.
Just fine.
Still the same
little town I remember.
Be careful, Sheriff.
It ain´t New York,
but it ain´t that little.
If I were you,
l´d watch where you´re goin´.
Same with that pretty
little girl of yours.
I´d hate to see her wind up
with the wrong crowd.
Afternoon, Delilah.
Good afternoon, Mayor.
So what is this place anyway?.
It´s an old iron mine.
They say it´s bottomless.
Some miners disappeared
down there in the ´50s.
They never found the bodies.
Some say they fell straight to hell.
You can still hear them screaming
on a full moon.
Don´t listen to her. She´s a sucker
for all that supernatural bullshit.
- Hand me the hook.
- Here you go, Danny boy.
Hey, city girl.
I swing across,
you give me a kiss?.
No way.
I just may fall.
How about if I close my eyes?.
Do it, man.
So where´s that kiss?.
Hey! Somebody coming.
Shit, it´s my dad.
So I guess school
let out early today, huh?.
Daniel Dixon, sir.
Welcome to Ferren Woods.
Judge Dixon´s boy?.
Yes, sir.
Well, then you should know
more than anybody
that these ´´No Trespassing´´
signs up here have a purpose.
Absolutely, sir.
Well, let´s say
we pack up our gear
and get our little asses
out of here, huh?.
That sound like a plan?.
Yeah.
Come on, Jenny.
I´ll drive you home.
Dad!
No. He´s right, Jen.
Bye, Jenny.
Hey, shut up!
It was nice to meet you all.
No. The pleasure´s all mine.
First you tell me to make friends and then
you tell me you don´t like the friends I make?.
I give up.
Those kids are trouble, Jen.
You´re a bright girl.
You can see that, can´t you?.
Yeah, I can see a lot of things.
And what´s that supposed to mean?.
Nothing. Just forget it.
Can´t we do better than this?.
Your mother´s very concerned.
Are you gonna break her heart
like you did back east?.
That´s me.
Little ol´ heartbreaker.
I want you to promise me that you´re not gonna
hang out with those kids anymore.
Jenny, you hear me?.
Yes, sir.
So what´d you tell your dad?.
I didn´t.
You told your mother?.
- Hey, Danny boy.
- Yeah?.
Let´s show the new girl
some real fun.
- All right, cow tipping!
- Shut up!
- Here we go. You want to check it out, Pete?.
- Go for it!
- Go for it again.
- Here we go!
Knock it off!
Turn the lights back on!
Here we go.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Let´s get out of the car!
- Where is she?.
- You hit her, man!
She came out of fuckin´ nowhere!
- I saw her fall right here.
- Where the fuck is she?.
Does anybody know who she is?.
She´s nobody.
Look, she´s just some crazy lady
that lives in Ferren Hollow, all right?.
Some folks say she´s a witch.
Jesus! Look at my fucking car!
This doesn´t make any sense.
Where the hell did she go?.
Who cares?.
She walked away, she´s fine.
Wait a second.
We don´t know that, man.
- Does anybody know where she lives?.
- Look, Jen--
No, you look!
A hit-and-run is serious shit.
Now, where does
she live, Danny?.
I know.
All right! All right!
- Come on.
- Come on!
Check it out.
Shit. What the fuck is this?.
Pet Cemetery?.
- Ow!
- Be careful.
God, it looks like
something´s buried out here.
- This is a lot of fun.
- The cabin´s this way.
- Let´s go!
- Guys?. Guys?.
I haven´t been here since I was a kid.
- Just be careful.
- Yeah, watch it.
Damn.
This place looks
like a garbage dump.
It´s a cabin, stupid!
Come on up.
Guys, this is kinda weird.
Can we go home?.
- Would you shut up, Paulie?.
- Hello?.
Hello?.
Miss Osie?.
Hey, witchie, you got visitors.
Look at all this stuff.
Guys, let´s go.
She´s not here so we can leave.
It´s still warm.
Sure. In case she needs it
to cook up her sacrifices.
Young girls burn best.
You guys, cut it out.
This shit´s gross.
Hey, guys, check it out.
What is it?.
I don´t know.
Ask Marcie. She knows
all about this witch shit.
Don´t ask me.
This stuff is
way beyond Ouija boards.
Doesn´t this look like
that grave I tripped over?.
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
This looks like a page
from the Book of Shadows.
What?.
It´s like a spell book.
Let me see that.
Wait.
Guys, this is a spell
to bring back the dead.
Is that blood?.
Supposedly blood of the damned.
That´s disgusting.
This is great.
We´ve got a spell
to bring back the dead.
- We got some cursed blood.
- What are you talking about?.
What l´m talking about
is some real danger, man.
Some real excitement.
Whatever that old witch
has got buried out there,
she wants to bring back to life.
Let´s help her out.
Yeah, Paulie.
You guys, this is serious shit.
Danny, I wouldn´t fuck
with it if I were you.
Neither would l. Let´s go.
What do you think, Jenny?.
You game?.
Look, we came here
to check on the old woman.
A little danger
never hurt anyone, right?.
Look, we knocked
when we first came in.
Leave here.
Now.
I think she´s blind.
These eyes can see
more than you know, boy.
We were just worried
that you might be hurt.
You know, the accident.
We didn´t see you.
We´re really sorry.
Let´s go. Come on.
Leave it here.
It´s very dangerous, boy.
Don´t walk with it.
What?.
You don´t know the evil
you are conjuring, boy.
Give it to me!
Give it to me!
- Let´s get out of here.
- Come on! Let´s go!
Come on, guys!
You...will...die.
You...all...will...die.
Miss Osie curses
every one of you
to the vengeance of Pumpkinhead.
- Come on.
- Damn.
- This is getting out of hand.
- Can we just go home?.
- Let´s go home.
- You´re the one who wanted to stay.
Don´t be a wimp, Paulie.
Here it is.
Let´s do this.
Danny, are you sure?.
There´s no turning back, now.
Pay dirt.
Hey, help me down.
Come on.
Okay.
Take this right here.
Here we go, man.
What the fuck is that?.
It smells.
Oh, Danny, this is really sick.
Pour the blood, Marcie.
- l´m pouring the blood.
- l´ll read the words.
´´Death by anger
seared with pain.´´
Look, I don´t need thrills
this badly, guys.
I´m out of here.
´´Soul who wanders
what is thy name?"´
´´Entreat thy lord from far below.
Breathe life anew...´´
´´... into thy soul.´´
Shut up!
Oh! Help me!
- Help! Help!
- Guys!
This shit looks like it´s a dud.
Thank God. I´m out of here.
Looks like old witchie
wasn´t a witch after all.
Fire! Guys!
Guys, the old lady´s
house is on fire!
She´s still in there!
- Guys, here!
- Oh, my God.
- How´d this thing start?.
- Where´s the old witch?.
She probably already got out.
Let´s get out of here.
- No!
- We gotta get out of here!
We gotta go now!
Let´s go!
You guys, we can´t go!
Come on! Go!
- Close the road off next to the mill, okay?.
- Right.
Sheriff.
Hey, Marie.
How´s the old woman?.
Doesn´t look good. We´ve got her at the
local clinic and it´s just a matter of time.
Fires like this--
accidents happen.
Maybe it wasn´t an accident.
This is an outside windowsill.
These marks are all over the place.
From the looks of them, something
was trying to claw its way in.
I´m just not sure whether it was trying
to help her or to kill her.
- Take it to the lab and give it to Delilah.
- Sure.
- Thanks, Marie.
- You got it.
Look, l´m sorry, Jenny.
We were just havin´ some fun.
Danny, she´s in the hospital.
You saw that fire.
There´s nothing we could have done.
Let´s just drop it, all right?.
- But, Danny--
- But, what?.
That old woman--
Hey, look!
Everybody´s gonna
keep their mouth shut.
And nobody´s gonna get wise.
You got it?.
Just chill, all right?.
- Whatever.
- Shit.
It must have been an accident.
You didn´t say anything
to your old man, did you?.
No.
You know l´d never
hurt anyone, don´t you?.
What´s with the gun, Ernst?.
Free country, ain´t it?.
I come here to get my money back
for this here huntin´ license.
Is there a problem?.
Ain´t nothin´ no law can handle.
´Cause now that
that old witch is riled up,
you ain´t gonna get me
in that hollow.
I´m afraid I don´t follow you.
Them damned kids don´t know
what they done messed with.
But when they messed
with old Miss Osie,
they done messed
with Satan hisself.
There were kids up there?.
I was out walkin´ in the woods.
I seen this red car-- a convertible.
Fast kids rumblin´ by.
You gonna give me
my money back or not?.
Yeah.
I don´t want any
unhappy hunters out there.
I ain´t no hunter no more.
I´m the hunted.
´Cause it´s back.
And ain´t none of us safe
till he gets what he come for.
Wait, wait, wait.
Just what are you talkin´ about?.
Why don´t you ask
the judge or the mayor?.
They the smart ones.
I´m just a dumb old farmer, right?.
Oh, shit.
Afternoon, Sheriff Braddock.
Nice car.
Thanks. Judge is inside.
You can go ahead on in.
Actually I dropped by
to talk to you.
- Really?.
- Yeah.
You probably heard about
that fire last night?.
Yeah.
I sure am sorry to hear about that old woman.
She gonna pull through?.
We´ll just have to wait and see.
You don´t know anybody who
might have been up there, do you?.
I sure don´t, Sheriff.
Some dent.
How´d it happen?.
I hit a dog.
Aha.
Big dog.
Problem here, Sean?.
- Hey.
- I was just tellin´ Sheriff Braddock here
how I was home all night studyin´.
You know, last night.
Yes.
Studying.
Yes, the boy´s quite a student.
I bet he is.
Sharp car, too.
Not another one
like it within 50 miles.
Somehow I figured that.
- Judge.
- Sheriff.
You be sure and tell Jenny
I said hi, Sheriff.
You been up to somethin´
you shouldn´t have?.
He´s just pissed off
´cause l´m seein´ his daughter.
You´re already on probation, boy.
I had a hell of a time
arrangin´ that.
You screw up one more time,
I can´t cover for you!
Hey, don´t worry
about covering for me.
I can take care of myself.
Hey!
Oh, no.
It is happening again.
He is coming.
Oh, Lord God, gimme strength.
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall fear no evil.
And thy rod
and this shotgun shall comfort me.
Lord God, save me!
Come on, Satan!
Children...
Sinners, you´re going to discover
the wrath of the beast.
Here comes your God.
He is our savior.
Believe the beast
and he will show you no mercy.
Satan.
Satan is not your friend.
Well, Dixon didn´t waste any time
gettin´ over here, did he?.
You sure you´re ready for this?.
Ten years in the 1 2th precinct´s
made me too ready.
- Let´s do it.
- Right.
You know,
before I came here,
I worked in the New Orleans
coroner´s office for two years.
They brought in some
real hamburger meat.
But I ain´t ever seen
anything this bad.
Manhattan dumpsters
have got nothin´ on this.
Well, you ask me,
another one of them wildcats
has been scavenging around here.
Old Ernst, he´s been bitchin´
about them comin´ down from the hills
poachin´ his chickens.
Well, it´s hard
to tell much of anything
until I take him back to the lab.
Or what´s left of him.
Dee?.
What you got?.
Either an unusual blood splatter
or somethin´s been
drawn here on purpose.
Drawn?.
Well, what is it?.
I´ll get Cory and the boys
to put a huntin´ party together
and we´ll track it down.
Now, just hold on there, Judge.
The last thing I need
is a trigger-happy posse
who thinks everything
that moves is a wildcat.
Ernst talked about something
coming back for revenge.
Well, I don´t mean
to speak ill of the dead,
but old Ernst,
he´s just a scared old boy
with a head full of rats.
H. Christ.
Clean this mess up.
- Goddamn.
- Bye, fellas.
We got a real winner here.
Well, here´s my autopsy report.
- You want some coffee?.
- l´m wired enough.
Old Ernst took one hell of a ride.
Severed limbs, lacerated quads,
crushed thorax,
and, not to mention,
63 broken bones.
And it gets weirder. Look.
Look at these striations.
Identical to the ones
on Miss Osie´s windowsill.
So whatever killed Ernst
was also at Miss Osie´s place.
- Jen.
- l´m sorry, Mom.
I´ll get that.
It´s probably for me.
- Hello?.
- It´s me. Can you come out?.
No. It´s not a good time.
We have to talk, Danny.
You didn´t tell
your dad anything?.
No, but I think he´s starting
to put things together.
What together?.
The old woman, some farmer
who just got killed.
- Something really strange is happening.
- Don´t worry about it.
I talked to my old man
and I won´t let anything
happen to you, okay, doll?.
Jenny, dinner´s ready!
I´ll be right there!
Look, I gotta go.
I´ll see you
after school tomorrow, okay?.
Want me to come over later
and tuck you in?.
No, at least not tonight.
All right.
Bye.
You think an animal did this?.
If an animal got old Ernst,
it wasn´t of this world.
Then what?.
Well, I can tell you what it wasn´t.
It wasn´t some wildcat
like Judge Dixon says.
A wildcat can´t make
claw marks like this.
Some folks...
around say it´s...
Pumpkinhead.
Pumpinkhead?.
What is that?.
Some kind of a fairy tale?.
There is a legend about it
around these parts.
It´s a kind of a demon
the hill people believe in.
I remember hearing about it
when I was a kid.
It´s said,
if you´ve been wronged,
you can conjure Pumpkinhead
to exact revenge in your name.
But if you do, you´d be
damned for all eternity.
There is a nursery rhyme
about it, isn´t there?.
How´s it go?.
Bolted doors
and windows barred.
Guard dogs prowling in the yard.
Won´t protect you in your bed.
Nothing will
from Pumpkinhead.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
Oh, don´t stop.
Oh, don´t stop
Ain´t nothin´
gonna stop me, honey.
Ain´t nothin´.
My wife says you can´t teach
an old dog new tricks.
She just must have forgot
the way you like to be petted.
Besides, some things
just get better with age.
More out in the truck.
Oh, this beats the hell
out of deliverin´ mail.
Looks good.
Damn it! Jesus Christ!
Get the fuck out of my house!
Sorry to wake you, Sheriff,
but I thought you´d want to
know we got us another murder.
Oh, man. Where?.
Out at Red Byers´ place
off connector three.
You know where it is?.
I´ll find it.
Wings.
That´s what it is, you know.
Blood wings.
I don´ know what it all means,
but there´s some kind of helter-skelter type
message being left here.
It´s a message Red Byers
wished had never come.
A postman who obviously stole
more mail than he delivered,
a goat farmer from the Hollow
and an old conjure woman.
What do all of these people
have in common?.
Well, Ernst and Byers haven´t
spoken to each other for years.
Well, maybe nobody
ever spoke to ´em,
but somebody
sure as hell hated ´em.
This much?.
Look,
what you got here
is some psycho out there
killing for fun and taking
the credit for the work.
Uh-huh.
What´s this?.
Safe-deposit box key,
it looks like.
I don´t think that´ll help
you find the killer.
But I think this might.
I did a field test.
And all the blood is type O.
Same as Byer´s...
except this one.
I believe this is
the killer´s blood.
- Get back.
- Oh, shit.
Hold her still!
- There.
- That´s it.
It´s okay. It´s okay.
Easy now. Easy.
Oh, sweet Jesus.
- lt´s like she´s not even here.
- She´s not.
Whatever she saw scared her so bad
her mind couldn´t deal with it
and it shut down.
It´s one step away
from being scared to death.
Sheriff. People are saying
it´s some sort of a monster.
A demon!
Have you made any progress,
any clues?.
Sheriff, you better catch him.
I´m working on it, ladies.
I´m working on it.
- So did you boys raid the armory?.
- We´re here with the judge.
If you´ve still got these guns
when I come out, l´m hauling your asses off.
He just walked in the door now.
Are we comfortable?.
Unless my calendar´s
running a little slow, Judge,
I´d say that wild bunch of yours out there
is a few weeks too early
to be walking around
with hunting rifles.
Not when there is hunting
to be done presently, Sheriff.
I understand that folks are
shook up about these killings,
but you should know better than
I that it takes a hell of a lot more
to catch a killer than to load a rifle
and form a posse.
We have our ways
in this town.
A little buckshot
solves a lot of problems.
Well, that´s just great.
And what if your way kills
the wrong person, huh?.
Boy.
Correct me if l´m wrong,
but I don´t think you would know one way
or the other, would ya?.
Judge, as long as
l´m wearing this badge,
we break this case my way.
Danny! I--
Just stop. I really
don´t feel like this.
What´s the matter?.
I thought you wanted to.
What´s the matter?.
Danny, there was
another killing last night.
And my dad thinks
it has something to do with...
what happened out
at Miss Osie´s place.
You didn´t say anything, did you?.
Of course I didn´t say anything.
But--
- But what?.
- Maybe I should.
Are you nuts?.
Look, if you tell him
the fire wasn´t our fault,
- I mean...
- Look, they´re gonna slam us.
You can bet nobody´s
gonna believe it was an accident.
Maybe my dad will.
Look, Jen.
We didn´t do this alone, not really.
I´ll take care of everything, okay?.
Don´t worry about it.
You all right?.
- Oh, shit.
- I gotta go.
All right, but we´re all getting
together tomorrow at my place.
Okay.
Be there.
We saw you talking to Jenny.
What are you guys talking about?.
No, let me guess.
She wants to rat us out, right?.
You´re out of line, Pete.
Tell him, Marcie.
Lindstrom sent me down
to the principal´s office today.
There were some files
on his desk.
One of them was Jenny´s.
Some real interesting stuff in there.
Seems she got into some pretty
bad trouble at her old school.
She and some friends
stole a teacher´s car.
They got caught.
Funny thing, though.
Jenny was the only one
who wasn´t charged.
She squealed
to her old man, Danny.
So her old man pulled a few strings
and got her out of a bad scene.
That doesn´t mean
she squealed on anybody.
There´s something else.
We´ve heard all the talk, Danny.
All that...stuff
about Pumpkinhead.
Yeah, so?.
What if that body we dug up--
What if--
What?. What if it
was Pumpkinhead?.
What if we brought him back to life
and he´s out there killing people?.
What if he is?.
What if he comes after us?.
Jesus, you guys are pathetic.
How do you know we didn´t
do something out there?.
That was some pretty bad shit
we were messing with, Danny.
All right, fine.
Danny will take you out there
and show you that no monster
crawled out of that box.
Then maybe you´ll
leave me the fuck alone.
Sure, Danny. Sure.
So, what have we got here?.
Well, what´s left
of Red Byer´s life, I guess.
Let´s see what´s in here.
Legal papers...
Jewelry.
Some money.
And these.
´´Deformed Boy
Runs Wild in Hills.´´
When I was a kid, there was an orphan boy
who lived in the woods.
Nobody knew
where he came from.
People thought he was a freak of nature,
a reject from the circus.
Some people actually
believed he wasn´t even human.
Oh, that´s horrible.
As far as any
of us were concerned,
he´d raised himself in the woods.
His name was...
Thomas Parnell.
People thought he
was a geek or something.
The story goes, okay,
that if he found you alone,
he would rip your heart out and eat it right
there, so you had to watch as you died.
All those horrible things they said
about Tommy just simply were untrue.
I never told you this...
but when I was seven years old,
I used to play by that old
abandoned railroad mineshaft.
One day,
I´d left a toy there.
And when I went back
to get it the next morning...
there he was.
Tommy was just
a little boy, like me,
grateful that I had saved his life.
We moved away shortly after that.
I never saw him again.
According to this clipping,
he hung himself
in 1 958.
I don´t get it.
Why would a retired postman
keep hidden under lock and key clippings
about a deformed boy
who died 35 years ago.
I´m really glad you came.
Thomas Parnell, an orphan,
died in 1958.
I need to see
the coroner´s report.
I can get them,
but it´ll take time.
Do it.
Now, what´s so important?.
I did an analysis of the blood
out at Red Byer´s place--
- The blood of the killer.
- Yeah.
I´ve never seen blood
like this before.
I know it sounds crazy.
But whatever´s out there
doing the killing
is unlike any life I know.
It´s...some kind of...
Monster?.
You think it´s the legend, hmm?.
Pumpkinhead?. Is that what
you´re trying to tell me?.
I don´t know what it is.
All I know is,
it´s not an animal.
It´s not human.
So, what is it?.
Gentlemen, may we help you?.
- The mayor´s been looking for you.
- Yeah, you!
I´ve been doing everything
in my power to deal with this.
I´m sure you have.
But you must have heard the talk
that maybe what we´re dealing
with here ain´t human.
Do you believe that?.
Well, of course not.
But a lot of folks do.
A lot of tourists...do,
if you know what I mean.
No, I can´t say that I do.
Well, let me put it this way.
The Loch Ness Monster.
The Abominable Snowman.
Big Foot.
That stuff is big business.
The way I see it,
this thing could put us on the map.
I got a couple of guys from the National
Enquirer all set to come down here!
People have died here!
You do know that, don´t you?.
Tragedy, ain´t it?.
Well, so is the budget
of this here town.
You get my drift?.
If you´ll excuse me.
Thank you.
I want that creature, Braddock!
Dead or alive! I want it!
All right, kids.
Let´s take a look at your creature.
Shut up.
- Oh, man!
- Goddamn.
I told ya, you shouldn´t have done it,
Danny! I told you!
Would you shut up, Paulie?.
It means nothing!
Nothing?.
The body´s gone, Danny.
- The spell worked, man.
- Oh, Christ.
I told you guys before,
you cannot raise the dead!
Right.
Then tell that to whatever
used to be buried down there!
- What the fuck have we done?.
- We´ve done nothing!
Would you guys get a grip?.
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.
I told you. Guys,
we gotta tell somebody.
You´re keeping your mouth shut.
There is a good explanation
for all of this.
And until we find out what it is,
we´re sticking together.
We´re all getting together
tonight at my place.
Until then, you guys keep
your mouths shut, you got it?.
Let´s get out of here.
Yee-haw!
Ain´t that a bitch.
Damn cock went limp on me.
Ain´t the first time.
Give it up, boys. Give it up.
Come to papa.
Baby needs a new pair
of shoes.
Thank you, boys.
Pleasure doing business with you.
- Suckers.
- See you next time, huh?.
- Not bad for a night´s work.
- You got that right, brother.
Hey, you missed something here.
I said you missed something there.
She can´t hear you, stupid.
Well, she´s got eyes, don´t she?.
Hey. I said you missed
something there.
Can´t you see it?.
Can´t you see it, huh!
Come here.
I hate when you do that.
What kind of way is that
to treat our baby sister?.
You got a lot of room to talk.
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?.
I ain´t the one sleeping with her.
What the hell´s going on here?.
Brian! Fred!
What the hell´s happening here?.
Brian, what the hell´s going on here?.
Fred! Fred, what the hell is that?.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I was driving home
when I picked her up
on the side of the road half-crazed.
She works out
at the Knox brothers.
Sister, I think.
She´s deaf and mute, Sean.
So whatever she saw,
she can´t help us.
I´m afraid not.
But maybe this can.
Whatever it is made a real mess
of the Knox brothers.
I´m gonna need help
with the bodies.
- We have to stop this.
- Stop what?.
We don´t know what it is, let alone
where it´s liable to strike next.
I don´t believe
it´s killing at random.
Ernst, Byers,
now the Knox brothers.
They´re all somehow
tied in together.
And the answer´s
got to be with this.
If we can just figure out
what that means,
we figure out where it strikes next,
we get there first,
and God help us,
kill whatever it is.
The legend persists
in rural American folklore.
Deformed children were denounced
by mountain priests as hell spawn.
Said to be the union of a demon
invoked by witchcraft
to right a wrong
and a woman born
of mortal flesh.
When a woman was suspected
of having intercourse--
I need to talk to you.
I thought you were at work.
This is Jenny´s sweater.
She was wearing it the other night.
It smells like smoke.
So she was at Osie´s place.
All over again she does this to us.
All over again!
The coroner´s report
just came in on Tommy.
According to this,
Thomas Parnell
supposedly hung himself
in this area.
- Why supposedly?.
- I just don´t buy it.
He couldn´t have
done this to himself.
The contusions-- they happened
over a period of several minutes.
They came from
all sides of the body.
This is more consistent
with a bludgeoning than a hanging.
So, he was murdered.
Brutally. And somebody
tried to cover it up.
But Tommy was an orphan.
Now there´s nothing in these records
that indicates the county
buried him in a pauper´s grave.
That´s because
his body was claimed.
And guess by whom.
Old woman Osie claimed
Thomas Parnell´s body.
But they weren´t even related.
She buried him in that cemetery
near her place
and tended the grave
lovingly ever since.
Like she was his guardian angel.
What´s going on?.
What happened?.
I lost her.
It´s 8.. 1 9. I´ll make the call.
Damn it!
Tommy´s guardian angel
just flew away.
Sorry, Sean.
It´s okay.
What?.
It is too late to help me,
like it is too late
to help the others.
- This can´t be.
- Oh, my God.
What do you mean, others?.
The ones he´s going to kill.
Is...
he the one who pulled you
from the fire?.
Who pulled you
from the fire, Osie?.
Tommy did.
This is a nightmare.
She´s dead.
Before I died, I was
the guardian of his soul.
Tommy´s soul.
A very special soul.
His mama...
nothing special about her.
But his papa--
Go on.
His papa was the one
you call Pumpkinhead.
The legend is true.
Why...is he killing all these people?.
The ultimate vengeance
is the vengeance you seek
for your own soul.
I saw him kill the farmer,
the postman,
and them other three.
They got what they deserved!
Them boys with them wings.
Blood wings.
Red wings!
He´ll kill them six boys
with them red wings.
- Six?.
- There were five victims!
Who´s the sixth, Osie?.
And what are the red wings?.
And when he kills them six boys,
he´ll go after the kids that burned me.
Please.
Help us, Osie.
Tell me how to stop him.
Take this.
It may help you.
Red wings. Red wings.
There´s something
familiar about them.
There´s nothing
in these yearbooks.
Wait. Ah, here we are.
Look at this.
The Red Wings.
It´s an auto club. They cruise
and hang out together.
Who do we got here?.
Jody Red Byers.
Ernst Heller.
The Knox brothers.
Who´s number six?.
That´s Judge Dixon.
It´s gonna kill the judge next.
Having a little party, huh, boy?.
Well, I got you and your friends
all set up in the little cabin.
I had it stocked this morning,
so there should be plenty to drink.
If that´s what you got
on your mind.
Hope you got protection, honey.
Sorry.
Oh, l´m cold.
I wish I brought my jacket.
Wait here.
- Here. Use my dad´s.
- Thanks.
Those monsters probably already drank
everything my dad put in there.
- Are they there?.
- Yeah, I think so.
Hey, this is supposed to be a party.
You guys are deader than shit.
Look, man, forget about the party.
We need to talk.
Then talk.
That old woman-- that witch--
Danny, she died!
Well, l´m real sorry to hear that,
but the woman was old.
She didn´t die
of old age, Danny. She--
She what, Paul?.
You know.
What do I know?.
Look, we had nothing to do
with that fire.
It was an accident.
Maybe if you hadn´t hit her,
she could have gotten out faster.
Maybe the fire wouldn´t
have happened at all.
He doesn´t know what he´s talking
about, Jenny. I never hit her.
I saw you do it, Danny.
I saw you.
You killed that old woman!
- He´s lying, Jen!
- No, you´re lying!
Look, we´re all guilty.
Okay?.
We´re gonna have to go
tell my dad, Danny.
She´s right. You do what you want, Danny.
We´re gonna go to the sheriff.
Like hell you are.
What, are you crazy?. Paulie!
Are you okay, man?.
Are you all right?.
- Let´s get out of here.
- Nobody´s going anywhere until I say.
What the fuck are you doing?.
Get on the couch now.
Put the gun down!
Put the fucking gun down!
Get on the fucking couch now!
Jenny said she was meeting
her friends at the judges.
Good God, Sean, hurry!
Come on. Come on.
I know you´re there.
Pick the damn phone up.
- Hello.
- Cory!
- Yeah.
- Judge here.
Listen, boy, I need you
and the others out here tonight.
- Why is that?.
- Been too many of my old friends dying lately,
and I got good reason
to think I might be next.
How do you know that?.
It could be anything.
Don´t ask me how I know!
I just know, that´s all.
You and the boys
get out here, muy pronto.
And bring a damn arsenal
with you.
All right, Judge, I´ll see who
I can round up on short notice.
- Hold on a second.
- What?.
What?.
Hello?.
Hello, Judge?.
Sweet fucking Jesus.
Judge?.
Hello?.
Holy shit!
Jesus!
Get your ass over here now!
Who the fuck are ya?.
Who?.
What the fuck are you?.
Well, come on.
That´s it, that´s it.
Eat this, you fucking freak!
Son of a bitch!
You.
You. It can´t be you. No!
What the fuck was that?.
Nobody move.
It´s him, Danny. He´s here!
It´s Pumpkinhead!
Shut the fuck up.
He´s gonna kill us.
He´s gonna kill us all!
- I said shut the fuck up, Paul!
- Oh, God.
What are you gonna do?.
What do you want from us?.
Paul, I want you to go around back
and I want you to get the car.
Just do it!
- Please, Danny--
- Just do it now!
Come on!
Fuck!
Paul´s been gone for a long time.
Nobody move!
The power´s dead,
and so are we.
He´s gonna kill us
because of that old witch.
Where the fuck is Paul?.
What the fuck?.
Go, go, go, go!
Go!
- Come on!
- This way! This way!
- Go!
- Spread out! Go!
Come on, Marcie!
Let´s go! Come on!
We gotta get the fuck
out of here! Come on!
Here!
Come on!
Come on, Marcie! Come on!
Motherfucker!
You motherfucker!
- Dee.
- Over here.
- What is it?.
- It got the judge.
And there´s a dead kid
in the cabin.
Jenny´s out there.
Come on!
Come on!
Dad!
Look! Go this way, now!
All right, let´s kill it.
All right, boys, lock and load.
Come on! Come on!
Go! Go!
Get out of the way!
I hear something.
Let´s go. Sounds like
he´s at the top of the hill.
No, Tommy!
- Don´t!
- Dad, help!
I´m not gonna hurt you!
Oh, my God!
Look, Tommy.
Miss Osie left me this.
I know you trusted her, Tommy.
Please, trust me.
Your soul can rest now.
You´ve avenged your own murder.
You punished those who hurt Osie.
She´s not one of them!
I saved your life once right here.
Don´t you remember?.
Please, she´s my daughter.
Please!
It´s all right, honey.
You´re safe now.
Thank you, Tommy.
Thank you.
Sean, the judge´s posse!
Oh, my God!
- Go on.
- All right, lock and load.
Go, Tommy.
Get the hell out of here!
They´ll destroy you!
Move out of the way, Sheriff.
What are you doing?. Go!
Go, Tommy!
Get out of here!
Stop! Hold your fire!
What the hell are you doing?.
Waste him!
Eat this!
Drop him!
Drop him!
Mom told me about Tommy.
How you saved him
when you were a kid.
He didn´t kill me
because he trusted you.
I´m sorry, Dad.
For everything.
What is it?.
An old fire truck.
How did it get--
