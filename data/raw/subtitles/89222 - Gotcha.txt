Would you get away

Look, l-I'm sorry.
I'll pay for the cleaning.
How can I make it up
to you? I'll take you
to dinner tonight.
I don't believe you.
You run around here
playing Cowboys and Indians.
You smashed into me
like a complete creep.
You destroy my $60 sweater.
- And you've got the balls
to ask me to go out with you?
- Yeah.
You are without a doubt
the biggest asshole...
I have ever seen
in my entire life.
Does that mean no?
Don't worry about it.
Tonight's no good

Muffy?
Yeah.
Who are you?
Jonathan Moore.
I'm in Professor
Webster's class.
Oh, yeah, hi!
I was... Hi!
I was just, uh, wondering
if you were doing anything
Saturday night.
Uh, no,
I don't think so.
Well, would you like
to go out with me?
No.
But you just said
you weren't doing anything.
Mm-hmm.
You mean
you'd rather do nothing
than go out with me?
[Chuckling]
Yeah.
Jonathan, wait up!
Hey, Manolo.
You didn't wash the dishes
this morning, again.
I didn't?
We're supposed to share
housework, remember?
Jesus, Manolo,
are you my roommate
or my mother?
{y:i}[Girl]
{y:i}Hi, Manolo.
Who was that?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I almost got nailed
this morning.
By who?
Reilly.
Reilly?
Reilly's a puss.
He ambushed me
outside of Haines Hall.
I didn't even have my gun.
So what did you do?
Hid in a bush, and
he walked right by me.
You're a regular
James Bond, man.
Yeah, exceptJames Bond
had Pussy Galore.
I can't even get a date.
[Growling]
"Ordinarily, we don't"... "we don't"
{y:i}get this type of specimen
{y:i}in an undergraduate class,
{y:i}but I wanted to give you
{y:i}something to remember
{y:i}over Spring Break.
Now, when we have
a sick cat like Tony here,
[Moaning]
He's gotta be
tranquilized...
in order
to do the examination.
[Moaning Continues]
Now, the name
of the tranquilizer
solution is...
{y:i}[Moaning]
Sernylan,
which I understand
is very popular at your parties.
[Laughing]
That's why we keep it
locked up here.
{y:i}[Jonathan] She told me...
she would rather sit
at home and do nothing
than go out with me.
{y:i}[Tiger Moaning]
What's wrong
with me, man?
You're too negative, man.
Negative?
What's negative about,
"Will you go out
with me?"
The way you say something
is just as important
as "what" you say.
{y:i}Now, this is where
{y:i}the tranquilizer gun...
{y:i}[Moans]
And darts...
come into play.
{y:i}[Manolo]
{y:i}You gotta control the situation.
{y:i}You can't say,
"Uh, will you go out with me?
Huh? Please?"
Like you've never
gone out in your life.
You just look 'em
in the eye and you say,
"What time should
I pick ya up?"
...insert a dart...
{y:i}[Tiger Moans]
When we go to Paris,
you gotta let
those Frenchwomen know that
you've got your act together.
Always point the gun
away from the head
and towards the lower flank.
Go ahead. Make my day.
{y:i}[Dart Gun Bangs]
I don't know, Manolo,
I think it's hopeless.
[Groaning]
I'm never gonna
get laid!
Although that thought
may be of great comfort...
{y:i}to the women of the world,
{y:i}Mr. Moore,
as a future veterinarian,
you should know that...
every dog eventually
has his day.
[Students Laughing]
I mean, you just walk up to her
and say, "I would kill or die
to make love to you"?
No. Geez, no.
You gotta have
eye contact first.
You look, she looks,
then you say it.
Don't say it
like it's dirty.
Say it
from the heart.
Then it ain't dirty,
it's passion.
You goin' back
to the apartment?
Nah, I gotta go
to my folks' house.
Your dad still givin'
you a hard time
about goin' to Europe?
You kidding?
He "loves" the idea.
- It's out of the question.
- Why?
{y:i}We've been through this
{y:i}a hundred times.!
Europe costs a fortune.
Dad, I'm getting
a special deal
through school.
Jonathan.
Oh, thanks,
Rosario.
You're welcome,
Jonathan.
Look, it's part of
my education. You want me
to get an eduction, don't you?
When school's in session,
you get an education.
When it's not in session,
you get a job!
- Mom...
- Don't say "Mom."
Al...
Don't say "Al."
He says "Mom," you say "Al,"
and the whole thing
comes out of my pocket.
You're gonna learn
a hell of a lot more
workin' in the real world...
than you will chasin' skirts
around Pomona.
Pamplona.
"Pamplona, Pomona"...
I don't care if it's Cleveland.
You're not goin'.
It's out of the question!
Why does it have to be
either/or with you two?
You want to go to Europe,
you want him to go to work.
- Why can't you do both?
- Fine.
- Fine.
- Fine? It's not fine.
Why is it fine?
Because it is.
{y:i}It'll give him a chance
{y:i}to pull up his grades
{y:i}next quarter.
And just think. A week
in "Paree" and he'll come back
sounding just like, um...
Marcel Marceau.
Fantastic.
Dad, can I borrow
your camera?
It's not a camera, it's a Nikon.
And it's out of the question.
- Mom?
- Al.

[French Accent]
E-Excuse me.
You are American "boys-eh"?
Yeah.
You want a taxi
to Paris?
No, thank you.
It's too expensive.
No, no.
We're gonna take
the, uh, bus here.
No, no, no, no.
I make special price for you
because you are American "boys-eh."
It's cheaper, faster,
and much, much safer, hmm?
Come with me.
Shall we go?
Why not?
It's cheaper and faster...
[Imitating Taxi Driver]
And much, much safer!
[Laughs]
{y:i}[Engine Roaring,

- Jesus.
- "You boys are in a hurry?"
{y:i}[Jonathan]
{y:i}Hurry? No, it's okay,
{y:i}you can take your time.
- "[Manolo] Oh, man"...
- "[Driver] Bastard.!"
{y:i}Get out of my way.!
{y:i}[Manolo]
{y:i}Where'd you learn how to drive?
{y:i}East L.A.?
[Motor Roaring]
{y:i}[Manolo] Safer, huh?
Man, let me
out of here.
- "[Jonathan]"
{y:i}How much do we owe you?
- Uh, 400 francs.
Four... Wh...
I'm sorry, but
the-the meter says 200.
Oh, yes. Two hundred for you,
and two hundred for him.
That's four hundred.
Thank you.
Wh-What's that for?
Uh, "le service." The tip.
{y:i}Merci, au revoir.
{y:i}[Jonathan] Service the tip?
You can't want a tip
for that ride!
I think we just
got ripped off, amigo.
It's because
we're American "boys-eh."
[Laughs]
{y:i}[Jonathan] This is
{y:i}the Champs-Elysee, man. Biggest
{y:i}shopping street in the world.
The Arc de Triomphe's
up there. This is Paris.
{y:i}[Manolo]
{y:i}Look at those Eiffel Towers.
{y:i}We're talkin' "eyeful"here.
{y:i}[Jonathan] What you doin'?
{y:i}[Manolo] Excuse me, madam,
{y:i}I'd like to talk to you.
I want you
to meet my friend.
His name is Jonathan.
Jonathan, this is madam.
{y:i}Voulez-vous couchez
{y:i}avec moi ce soir?
{y:i}Quoi?
{y:i}Voulez-vous couchez
{y:i}avec moi ce soir?
Oh, you asshole.
She likes you.
What'd she do that for?
I just asked her out for dinner.
No, no, no. You asked her
if she would like to go
to bed with you tonight.
- I did?
- "I thought you took French."
{y:i}I did take French.
{y:i}I mean, I can say,
"This is my pencil,
my pencil is big,"
that kind of stuff.
Under the right circumstances,
that could be useful.
Yeah?
Yeah.
We gotta find those
circumstances, Manolo.
Thank you.
This is all in French, man.
I can't understand this.
Ah, wait a minute,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Can you
understand that?
{y:i}Oui.
Manolo, look at this place.
It's incredible!
It says here there are
over 208,000 works of art.
And that's like Roman,
Ancient Greek,
{y:i}the Mona Lisa.
- "Venus de Milo's here."
- Yeah, you mean the chick
with no arms?
Yeah, that's the one.
I mean, this is the palace
where the French kings
lived before Versailles.
And then Napoleon turned
it into the biggest museum
in the world.
What is your name?
Heidi.
I am Carlos, from Algeria.
Have you heard of me?
Isn't there a terrorist
named Carlos?
Shh!
I need your help.
I need you to walk
with me to my hotel.
I cannot walk
the streets of Paris alone.
Will you help me?
I don't know...
Shh!
Say no more.
I shall return.
What's goin' on?
I'm in!
[Chuckles]
You're in.
Her name is Heidi.
Heidi?
She's Swedish. We're goin'
back to the hotel.
Manolo, how'd you
do that so quickly?
Told her my name
was Carlos, man, and
I just got back from Algeria.
[Laughs]
She thinks I'm a terrorist.
Swedish chicks
go crazy for that shit.
So, give me two hours
before you head back
to the hotel.
Well, wait a second.
Maybe she's got a girlfriend
or something.
Hey, no offense, but uh...
I'm a terrorist.
I can't be seen
with somebody
who looks like Bambi.
I don't look like Bambi.
[Chuckling]
Okay, so you don't
look like Bambi.
Why don't you go check out
the Eiffel Tower?
I already saw it.
See it again.
Come on, gimme a break!
She's Swedish.
Hey.

I like, uh, smooth skin.
And tight,

I'm 18.
But you just said...

It is
a feeling of power.
[Sighs]
I gotta be honest with you.
I am a "weer-gin."
L... I, uh,
I've been close
a couple times, but
l-I've never actually...
Then, um, that is
second lie, Jonathan.
Do not let
there be a third.

I have business there.
What kind of business?
Nothing very exciting.
Maybe you would
go with me.

Yes, why not?

tickets and reservations
and stuff.
No, l-I understand you.
Have to stay

No, it-it's not
just my friend,
it's Spain.
I've been wanting
to go there
since I was a kid.
The Pyrenees
and the Picasso
Museum and...
bullfights
and Pamplona.
I mean, that's where
Hemingway wrote
his best stuff.
Jonathan, you do not
have to explain to me.
You do not want to go,
you do not want to go.
I didn't say
I didn't want to go.
Did I say
I didn't want to go?
I want to go.
I'm going.
We're go...
We're gone.
We're outta here.

You don't have to yell.
- Are you learning French?
- Yeah, yeah. Learning a lot.
Wonderful.
I just wanted to tell you that
there's been a change in plans.
I'm not going to Spain.
I met this real nice girl.
And we're going
to Berlin.
[Father] Berlin?
Jonathan,
I don't think you want
to go there, dear.
Oh, I'll be
fine, Mom.
I just wanted
to call and tell you
what I was doing, okay?
I love you a lot.
Okay, good-bye now.

{y:i}What have
{y:i}you been doing here?
Uh, learning about
{y:i}la grande passion,
{y:i}le grand amour.
What's that?
- How would you feel about goin'
on to Spain without me?
- What do you mean?
Sasha. She has to go
to Berlin on business, and
she wants me to go with her.
Berlin?
Yeah.
You're kidding me.
No, what's wrong
with Berlin?
Nothin'.
If you like machine guns
and barbed wire.
I thought you were all
psyched on this Spain deal.
{y:i}Yeah, I was,
"but, uh"...
- I just want to spend
more time with her.
- I don't know, man.
I think you're losing
your perspective.
Why?
There are millions
of girls in Spain.
I know there are millions
of girls there, but, uh,
Sasha's special.
She's special.
They're all special.
- I think I'm in love with her.
- You're in love with her.
I don't know if
it's actually love, but...
whatever it is, it's-it's
the most incredible thing
I've ever felt.
Jonathan, you don't
even know this girl.
You're gonna do fine in Spain
without me. You don't want
Bambi hangin' around.
I still think you're lettin'
the little head do the thinkin'
for the big head.
But hey, man.

{y:i}So why don't we go
{y:i}to Spain?
{y:i}Now?
{y:i}No, when you're done
{y:i}with your business.
{y:i}When's that
{y:i}gonna be, anyway?
{y:i}Tomorrow.
{y:i}Then we go
{y:i}to East Berlin.
East "Berlin?"
{y:i}Mm-hmm.
{y:i}Wait a second.
We're going
to East Berlin?
I tell you that,
yes?
No, no, no, no.
You didn't tell
me that.
Oh, yes.
Oh, no.
Mm. Well,
I'm sorry, but...
that is where
my business is.
Who has business
in East Berlin?
What are you,
a spy or something?
Yes, I am spy.
[Giggles]
No, I am like
a messenger boy.
A courier.
A courier.
Well, what
do you "couri"?
They do not tell me.
Who's "they"?
[Sighs]
They do not tell me.
I pick things up.
I bring them across.
I give to man.
He pay me.
I thought you were
a graduate student.
Yes, I am,
but with this job,
I make money
to pay tuition.
I'm not having
a rich father, you know.
So you've done
this a lot?
Many times.
You want me
to go with you?
Please.
How long is it
gonna take?
Only one day.
We can even
leave bags here.
I don't know.
You are afraid to go?
No, I'm not "afraid"
to go.
It just seems kinda
dangerous to...
bring stuff across
that you don't know
what it is.
But you tell me
you like danger.
Is that not what
your game is all about?
"Gotcha"?
Yeah, but that's
just a game.
You will see.
This will be
like game too.

I mean, that guard

Oh, Al.

he's only kidding.
Oh, God, this is great.
Ohh.
You wanna talk
about this?
Ah, Dad, I'm sorry.
It was in my backpack
when I jumped into the moat.
You jumped into a moat?
You jumped into a moat
with my Nikon?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
I had to. L...
This is kind
of a long story.
I've got all night.
Can I come in?
Sure.
'Course, dear.
Don't tell me.
This has to do
with that girl, right?
{y:i}Yeah, it does.
You knocked her up,
didn't you?
Oh, Jonathan!
Leave it to you to find the one
girl who isn't on the pill.
- No, no, no.
You guys are totally wrong.
- You didn't knock her up?
- No.
- You're flunking
out of school?
- No, I'm not flunking out.
- What is it? Drugs?
You're involved with drugs?
No, Dad.
I'm not involved with drugs.
Please just listen.
I told you about the girl
I met in Paris, Sasha.
Everything was going along okay.
We were having a great time.
I'll bet.
Will you
let him finish?
- Finish.
- She told me she was a courier
and had to pick something up.
- So we went to East Berlin.
- "East" Berlin?
- Oh, my God.
- No. Everything was okay
there too.
Sasha made her pickup,
and she gave me the strudel.
{y:i}Then this Russian guy
{y:i}started following her,
so she called
and told me to meet her
at the Cafe Friedrichstrasse,
{y:i}which really meant
{y:i}that I was supposed
{y:i}to get out of East Berlin.
So I go to the checkpoint
with the strudel,
and I get strip-searched.
- [Gasping]
Strip-searched?
- It's okay. I made it through.
{y:i}But then I go back to the hotel,
{y:i}and somebody'd stolen
{y:i}all my stuff,
{y:i}so I had to stay out all night.
The next morning at the Citadel,
Sasha wasn't there.
This lady showed up,
and she wanted the strudel.
Why did the lady
want the strudel?
She didn't,
but I didn't know that.
So I gave it to her,
and they shot her.
- They shot her?
- Who shot her?
I don't know, but they almost
got me too. That's why I jumped
into the moat.
They shot her
for a strudel?
No, not for the strudel.
For this.
What's that?
It's a roll of film.
What's on it?
- I don't know.
- Why don't you
get it developed?
Dad, are you kidding? I can't
just take this down to Fotomat.
It's got spy shit on it.
"Spy shit"?
Okay, he's on drugs.
- I am not.
- Sweetheart, it's all right.
We have counseling programs.
Whatever it costs,
we don't care.
- You guys don't believe me.
- This is not a game, son.
This is your life.
You're right. I'm on drugs.
I'm a junkie.

He's in a gray Mercedes.
He's a K.G.B. Agent.

{y:i}[Phone Ringing]
Duty officer.
Yeah, my name
is Jonathan Moore.
I'm not drunk, I'm not stoned
and this isn't a crank call.
I gotta come down there
right away, but your operator...
She won't give me your address.
What did you say
your name was, again?
Jonathan Moore.
And what's your problem?
- [Gun Cocking]
- Put the phone down. Hurry!
Let me see your hands.
Step outside the booth.
Hands behind your head.
What's going on?
- [Officer]
Shut up.
- That's him. I'll kill him!
That son of a bitch tried
to wreck my car!
Relax. We'll handle this.
You have the right
to remain silent.
If you give up
the right to remain silent,
anything you say...
can and will
be used against you
in a court of law.
Dad, you gotta
listen to me.
No, you gotta listen.
You know what you put
your mother and me through?
I'm at a police station at 4:00
in the morning, and she's
popping Valiums like M & M's.
That guy Bronski?
He's gonna sue you.
No, he's gonna sue me.
I'm responsible. You know
what your insurance rates
are gonna be?
You know how much money
this is gonna cost me?
I thought
he was chasin' me.
He was chasing you.
You ran him off the road.
He wanted to kick your ass.
"I" want to kick your ass.
I thought he was
a K.G.B. From Russia.
What?
I thought he was
K.G.B. From Russia.
He's a C.P.A. From Encino.
What are you, crazy?
Yeah, maybe I am.
I know
you're a good kid.
Just get yourself
into a drug program, okay?
Yeah. Okay.
- What you got?
- Nothin'.
- Johnson?
- Nothin'.
Shit. Let's go.
[Sighs]
The kid must have it
on him.
[Ringing]
Duty officer.
This is Jonathan Moore.
I talked to you last night,
but we got cut off.
Yes.
I really need
your help.
I got this roll of film
from this girl in East Berlin.
I think it has
spy stuff on it.
Uh-huh.
This morning, some guys
trashed my apartment
looking for it.
Did they get it?
No, they didn't find it.
You should see this place.
They went through everything.
- We believe you.
- You do?
The agency is going to help you.
Just stay where you are, and
we'll send someone to get you.
No, I can't do that.
I don't know who anybody is.
Anybody could come here
and say they're the C.I.A.
I gotta come to you.
All right. Calm down.
Our address is
444 Flower Street, suite 700.
Do you have the film,
or is it hidden?
No, I have it.
But there's something else.
My girlfriend...
Her name's Sasha Banicek...
She's in trouble.
She's still in East Berlin.
Don't worry about her.
We'll take care of everything.
{y:i}You're bringing the film
{y:i}with you, right?
{y:i}Yeah, I'm on my way.
- "All right."
{y:i}We'll see you.
- [Hangs Up Phone]
He's coming in.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Jonathan Moore.
I'm supposed
to see somebody.
I'll be with you
in a moment.
{y:i}[Man Laughing]
- "[Woman Laughing]"
- [Continues Laughing]
[Beeps]
Jonathan, dear,
it's Mother.
{y:i}I got the number
{y:i}of the Brentwood Drug
{y:i}Rehabilitation Center.
{y:i}It's 555-4731.
Please call them, darling.
Remember: It's your life.
[Machine Beeps]
This is Sasha.
{y:i}I'm at "Bonawenture"Hotel.
{y:i}Call me there
{y:i}as soon as you can.
{y:i}[Man]
{y:i}What the hell's goin'on
{y:i}in here?
What happened?
You're not gonna believe this.
It's happening to me,
and I don't believe it.
I'm listening.
After I left you in Paris,
Sasha and I went to Berlin.
I know.
Yeah. Then we went
to East Berlin.
East Berlin?
For what?
For this.
They don't sell film
in West Berlin?
- We didn't buy it.
We picked it up.
- What's on it?
It's got some
spy information or something.
Whatever it is, it's important.
"Spy information"?
{y:i}Sasha picked up the film.
She must've planted it on me,
because I didn't know I had it
until I got here.
- These Russians have been
following me from East Berlin...
- The Russians did this?
No, the C.I.A. Did this.
The C.I.A.?
Yeah. I think
Sasha's one of'em.
I went down
to the C.I.A. Office,
and there she was sittin'
in this room drinkin' coffee...
with the same guys
that trashed this place.
I hate to say it,
but I knew something like this
was gonna happen.
{y:i}[Phone Ringing]
Hello?
[Sasha]
Jonathan?
- Hi, Sasha.
- "Jonathan, you are okay?"
{y:i}I was so worried about you.
Y... Worried about me?
Wh-Why would you be worried
about me?
Did you get my message?
Yeah.
And you will come
to hotel?
I don't think so.
I have to see you.
I don't know what kind of game
you're playing, but we're
gonna start using my rules.
Hold on.
You still a homeboy?
You still a white boy?
Yeah. You're in a gang,
you're in a gang for life.
You think the homeboys
could do me a little favor?
Yeah.
There's a flower shop
across the street
from the Bonaventure.
Be there in an hour.
Jonathan, l...
{y:i}[Phone Clicks]
Hey, Sasha. If you wanna see
Jonathan, go to Olvera Street,
in front of the cross.
Olvera Street.
That's three blocks.
[Vendor Speaking Spanish]
[Continues In Spanish]
Is your name Sasha?
This is for you.
Are you "Shasa"?
Message for you.
[Reads In Chinese]
English.
El Mercado.
- Who's this asshole?
- Get in.
{y:i}Get in.
What's she doing?
{y:i}When two tribes go to war
{y:i}a point is all that
{y:i}you can score
{y:i}Let's go to war
{y:i}Let's go to war
{y:i}When two tribes go to war
{y:i}a point is all that
{y:i}you can score
{y:i}Working on the black gas
All right.
Move those cars.
This is the C.I.A.
- You've got no juice here, man.
- Yeah, well, this is
government juice, pachuco.
Show me your badges.
We don't know nothing
about no stinking badges.
We're not playing games
here, greaseball.
Neither are we, amigo.
Jesus.
You son of a bitch.
Remember the Alamo?
Manolo,
you are making mistake.
Those men are on our side.
Our side. Their side.
I don't know
about that shit,
but I got a friend
who's in trouble,
and I'm on his side.
Whose side are you on?
{y:i}[Bell Tolling Time]
[Car Horn Beeps]
[Manolo]
He's by the sculpture garden
near the statues.
He thinks
he's in love with you.
Be straight with him.
Hi.
Jonathan.
You are okay?
I know you're upset,
but now I can explain
everything.
Upset?
You think I'm upset?
You drag me to East Berlin.
A lady gets shot in my arms.
I'm getting chased by people
who kill people.
My parents think I'm a junkie.
And you're hanging out
with the C.I.A.
Why should I be upset?
Jonathan,
you do not understand.
No shit.
Let me explain.
Good idea.
Why don't you tell me
what's goin' on?
[Sighs]
I tell you I was a courier.
That's a lie.
I am operative.
A agent.
For the C.I.A.?
I'm very impressed.
That's a good job.
I did not mean for you
to carry that film.
That's lie number two.
Don't let there be a third.
No, I only wanted
to use you for a cover.
Why? Because I look stupid?
No, be... Innocent.
You look so innocent.
Goddamn it,
I'm telling you the truth.
You don't know what truth is.
[American Accent]
Jonathan, I didn't want
to use you.
Wait a second.
What... What just happened
to your accent? Huh?
Who the fuck are you?
Is there
anything about you
that isn't phony?
What's your name?
What's your real name?
Cheryl.
Cheryl. Cheryl what?
Brewster.
{y:i}Cheryl Brewster.
From Prague?
Pittsburgh.
{y:i}Pittsburgh.
Cheryl Brewster.
The spy from Pittsburgh.
That's good.
Oh, Jonathan.
I didn't even know
what was on the film
until we got to East Berlin.
Bullshit.
{y:i}They never used me
{y:i}for anything so important.
They told me somebody
was following me and...
and I would never make it
across the border.
They told me I had to use you.
I didn't have a choice.
Everybody has a choice.
{y:i}I thought we had something
{y:i}really good goin',
I really thought
you cared about me.
I did.
I do.
Shit!
[Russian]
In here.
Where are we going?
They're on my turf now.
[Russian]
- What are you doing?
- Tranquilizer gun.
Come on.
There's a phone
at the bottom of the hill.
Go call your friends.
Gotcha.
Aah!
Gotcha.
I'm at the bottom of the steps
near the Student Union.
So nice to see you again.
Come on. Let's wait
for your boyfriend.
[Russian]
[Grunting]
Did you call 'em?
Jonathan, don't!
Put the gun down
or I shoot the girl.
- "Put it down.!"
- "[Gun Drops To Ground]"
Where's the film?
- Thanks.
- Gotcha.
Take it easy.
I got it.
{y:i}[Police Radio,
{y:i}Indistinct]
Thank you.
The agency
owes you one.
Great.
I'll let you know when I need
my apartment redecorated.
Hey.
Can I talk to you?
What for?
This job's over.
You can go on
to the next one.
Is that the way
you think I feel?
I don't know how you feel.
All I know is I trusted you,
and you set me up.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
No, I really am.
There's nothing
to be sorry about.
I learned a lot from you.
I should be grateful.
Grateful?
I don't want you
to be grateful.
What do you want?
Right now?
Yeah.
You.
You don't want me.
I'm not your type.
Not a "weer-gin."
Not a little boy anymore.

I know.
