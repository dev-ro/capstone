ONE FINE DAY
One "farmer", please.
Okay, let's get started.
Sorry. Just a second.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Do you think it's already over?
Hell, no! We haven't started yet.
THREE MINUTES
in memory of M.M.
Anybody here?
Marcello!
This morning,
you were still sleeping
when I woke.
I heard your deep breathing.
And, through the hair
hiding your face,
I saw your eyes.
And I was choked by emotion.
Beyond your face,
I could see something purer
and deeper
in which I was reflected.
I was seeing myself
in a dimension
that contained all the time
that we have left to live.
All those years were there.
And also those that I lived
without knowing you
in order to know you.
At that moment,
I realized how much I loved you.
And the emotion was so strong
that my eyes filled with tears.
Three minutes.
IN THE DARK
Back in 15 minutes
Timofei!
What?
The fuses have blown!
What? Again?
The second sector has blown again!
All right. Just a second.

Focus!
Hey, the focus...
There's nobody here.
Is anybody here?
Cinema: Archimede.
Film : The Ceremony.
I take my mother to the movies
every now and then.
We go to see Legends of the Fall,
a family melodrama.
Brad Pitt and lots of actors.
For years,
my mother will chide me
for having taken her
to see that movie.
In this cinema, I saw
Truffaut's Domicile conjugal.
Bed and Boardin English.
The Italian title was
Calm Down, It's Just Infidelity.
Anastasia, a cartoon movie.
A few days ago, my son turned two.
Today is his first outing
to the movies.
After 10 minutes, he asks,
"Where's Mommy?"
I say, "Mommy's at home.
We'll join her after the movie."
After half an hour, he's screaming,
"What's wrong?" she asks.
"Nothing," he says. "They're closing
the stadium. Nothing to fear."
"What did you say?"
"What?"
"Just now, when you said
there's nothing to fear."
"It sounded like a familiar voice."
If, at the end of Heaven Can Wait,
Julie Christie and Warren Beatty
hadn't gotten back together,
I'd have staged a sit-in
at the cinema.
The Arlecchino Cinema,
now the Antonveneta Bank garage.
Her feet in What Lies Beneath
are beautiful.
And the second toe,
the "index" toe,
just next to the big toe,
above all on the right foot,
is a little longer than the big toe,
which some people say
is a sign of excellence...
Rocky Balboa, January 2007.
When Sylvester Stallone
starts training
by running up the steps...
I'm the first to applaud.
My son is seven years old.
The film hasn't started yet.
They show the trailer for Matrix 2.
Pietro asks:
"Will we see it when it comes out?"
"Sure, we'll see it."
Then I think, "Shall I tell him?"
I decide to:
"You know, Dad's movies
aren't much like that one."
"I know, Dad, but we'll go see
Matrix 2 when it comes out."
"All right, we'll see it."

He loves you, totally,
tenderly, tragically.
Me too, Paul.
l don't know...
l saw you earlier
when he kissed you.
l know.
Why don't you love me anymore?
That's life.
Why do you despise me?
I'll never tell you that.
Even to save my own life.
I've watched you for 5 minutes.
l feel I've never seen you before.
I'll never forgive you.

It's too late now.

MOVIE NIGHT
WARSAW
Satan can only be invoked
by whispering the unspeakable name
that melts into the burning flame.
70 YEARS LATER
Sorry to interrupt the screening.
There's an air raid warning
for Haifa.
Please!
I'm expecting more news
any minute.
Death.
THE FOUNDRY
The might of progress
will defeat the former power
The weapons will be rock, rock
If you protest, the butcher dreams
The paralytic's ashes will be placed
in a bucket or a barrel
Rock, rock that approaches
strikes, seduces, mistreats
Come here, I'll show you the place
UPSURGE
Excuse me...
- Hello.
- Hi!
- Okay?
- Great. I nearly called you.
Work's kind of crazy right now
but I'm doing okay.
My boss is in LA,
so they keep calling me
at all hours.
I'm working around the clock.
We're on a site in Asia.
Why not change jobs?
That's 12 euros, please.
Enjoy the film.
I hardly had lunch.
Yes, it's me.
47 YEARS LATER
Tell him to stop fidgeting.
He's making me dizzy.
- I bought them all.
- And?
I've searched them.
Nothing.
But I'm afraid
fate has turned on us.
Explain.
Pascal, our friend,
the Egypto-Armenian critic, said
that before our film screened,
the critics went for fish soup
on a nearby island.
They looked as if they had wallowed
in the local wine.
I noticed that most of them
were unsteady on their feet
and in a daze.
You were too nervous to notice.
Enough gossip.
Tell me what it says in Le Monde.
It's published on Saturday.
And Le Figaro?
Nothing.
Nor in Le Film Fran√ßais.
Les Cahiers neither.
And that dolt Pascal?
He heard a French critic
call the film slow but "edible".
Like fish soup?
More or less.
Why are you so upset?
You expected a triumph?
It's only your second film.
I forgot.
Nice Matin mentioned us.
"The sublime Czech film was followed
by Egypt's Son of the Nile."
Go on.
That's all.
At least it's proof
that we were selected.
Take this trash back
to the newsstand and get a refund.
You go.
No one will recognize you.
The special award
for the 50th festival goes to
Youssef Chahine
for his body of work,
for his humanity,
his tolerance,
his courage
and his clemency.
I've waited 47 years for this.
Some advice for young people...
Be patient. It's worth it.
