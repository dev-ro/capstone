There's a pilot.
The pilot has two copilots.
Each copilot has two crew members.
Each crew member has two passengers.
That makes 8 passengers,
4 crew members,
two copilots and one pilot.
Okay, all the passengers
give money to the pilot.
The pilot receives it all
and takes off.
The plane is split in two,
so each copilot
automatically becomes a pilot.
And everything starts again.
It's super simple.
What if there are no passengers?
- Not a problem, I assure you.
- Hello, everyone.
Can you tell me
what's going on here?
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Thanks, daddy.
The pleasure was all mine.
Sorry.
What for?
Next time, I'll warn you
when I'm having people over.
That would be very thoughtful.
That way, I could arrange
for a caterer.
I thought you had a key.
She promised to be on my plane.
Stop now. It's late.
Change the channel, please.
Wait.
Xenophobia: hooligans
attack immigrants
Triumph: Philippinos
celebrate the return of...
I hope you didn't let anyone in here.
Why don't you clean up a bit?
Tomorrow.
After the attack on foreigners
by racist football fans,
60 foreigners fled.
When did the whole gang arrive?
Evi came over around six
with the canap√©s.
And then most of the others,
later, at eight.
And she called beforehand?
And?
She said she had tried
to reach you.
Hello, son
good evening to you.
'Evening, dad.
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to air this room out for a change.
What's new?
Nothing.
- What are they saying?
- I dunno. Nothing.
Where did Evi get this money?
Did you give it to her?
Evi says her friend
won this game.
And?
And Evi wanted me
to give her 10,000
but I only gave her 5,000.
And the rest?
Her savings, I suppose.
Fortunately, no employee
was left in
the waste-sorting center.
For 3 days, the town
has been under Serbian attack.
The fire was brought under control
but some petrol leaked into the river.
I'm dead tired.
Good night.
It really wouldn't hurt
to air this room out.
'Night.
If you bet nothing,
you win nothing.
Speak for yourself.
With 500 schillings of pocket money,
it's easy to bet.
It's simple,
you just do the math:
for a 10 schilling bet,
you can win up to 80.
That will buy you three ice cream cones.
- If that's enough for you, okay.
- You're a real jerk.
What about you?
How much can you put in?
You're the first copilot.
The usual?
And six nuggets.
It comes to 61 schillings.
Here.
Number 28 for three days.
"Hi Benny. Have a good weekend.
Good luck with your homework.
"The fridge is full.
Kisses. Mom."
Fie to the ancient dragon
Fie to the jaws of death
Fie to the accompanying fear
Rage, O world,
And leap
I stand here and sing
Secure
and at peace
I'm returning those.  I'll take
3 and 16 for three days.
- Goodbye
- Goodbye. So long.
That way.
Come in, sit down anywhere.
What's this?
The view.
What view?
- Well, from my window.
- Live?
You want one?
I can also change channels.
- You're sure you don't want any?
- No, thanks.
Your parents bought you all this?
Go on, sit down.
This is all very cool.
Really.
It's not bad.
How come you're so into video?
You spend all day
stuck in front of the store
sucking down those things...
I dunno... just because.
I can lend you a whole bunch.
Some are pretty cool.
I dunno what you like.
That thing in the window,
it wasn't so hot.
I don't care...
I kinda like cartoons.
Which ones?
Roger Rabbit...
stuff like that.
You don't have brothers or sisters?
No. You?
Four.
That's not bad.
Older or younger?
Both.
Meaning?
You don't want to talk about it?
- No.
- I understand.
I don't think so.
I think I'm gonna go.
- Why?
- Just because.
Stay.
Why?
Just because.
Careful, it's hot.
- Wait a little longer.
- Okay.
How long does it take you
to come in?
A good hour.
Every day?
A matter of habit.
How?
First by tramway, then by bus.
What's this?
No idea.
A man in the metro.
- And this?
- I dunno.
A dog in the metro.
And this?
I dunno.
A policeman in the metro.
This must have gotten cold.
You want some milk?
I still have some.
What time is it?
14:30.
Do you have to go?
Good.
Every weekend
in that dead burg!
You just wanna die!
How come you didn't go today?
I said I was doing homework
with Ricci.
- Who's Ricci?
- A guy in my class.
- So? You're going to do homework?
- No.
- There, that's my father.
- Oh.
Mom's coming up behind.
That's her, there.
Oh yeah. And who are they?
They're the country folks
who rent the farm to us.
Now, watch closely.
It's snowing!
Did you film this?
How was it?
What?
You know, with the pig?
I mean...
Have you ever seen...
someone dead?
For real, I mean.
No. You?
No. That's why I'm asking you.
It was just a pig.
I saw a report on TV
on stunts for action scenes
and stuff like that.
They take ketchup and plastic,
but it looks real.
When my grandfather died,
he was already in the coffin
when we got there.
You know, they live in the country too.
The coffin was open
but it was pretty high up.
My dad lifted me up
so I could see
my grandfather
one last time.
But I closed my eyes.
I was still little.
I couldn't look inside the coffin.
My grandparents have been dead
for a long time.
I don't remember anymore.
You want to see something?
What?
Look.
This.
Is it the thing that...
How did you manage to get it?
I swiped it.
This is the ammo.
Cool.
Anyway, the farmer
had lost it.
The following weekend,
he told my father
we were lucky
he had already killed the pig,
otherwise we'd have to do
without bacon.
Squeeze it.
- Scaredy-cat.
- You're the scaredy-cat.
Just squeeze it.
Scaredy-cat.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Stay there.
I'll help you, come.
Stay there.
Come, I'll help you.
Be quiet.
Be quiet.
Hey, be quiet.
Stop, stop screaming,
please!
Be quiet, I beg you!
Yes, hello?
Hello, Ricci.
Great, when?
Okay, I'll be there.
I always said
you were a bastard.
Yeah.
He can just bring
his little friend.
Yeah.
Eh, if he doesn't want to,
he can just skip it.
Yeah, exactly!
What are you wearing?
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll see.
So, 7 o'clock, Karsplatz,
near the fountain. Okay.
As usual.
A pillow?
You want one?
You already have tickets
for AC/DC?
When are they playing?
Tuesday.
Man, I'm tired!
I can't even tell you!
Right...
Ricci!
Yeah?
Nothing...
What is it?
Nothing. Did you already
do the computer problem?
You give it to me tomorrow, okay.
'Night.
'Night.
Thanks.
I gotta go.
My parents will be back early.
If I'm not home...
Goodbye.
Too bad.
It was good to see you.
Goodbye.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Don't forget it, tomorrow.
We have computer class
at nine o'clock. Ciao.
- Who is it?
- Is my sister there?
Who is it?
Can I talk to Evi?
- Benny?
- Yeah.
She's not here.
When will she be back?
No idea. You wanna come up?
Thanks.
You're really sure?
I don't want your parents
to make a scene!
No, no, it's okay.
Benny?
You know what time it is?
We've been here for six hours!
Why are you only getting in now?
And you could have left a message
so we know where you...
'Evening, mom.
I'm sorry.
Don't you think there are
more intelligent ways to rebel?
Who are you trying
to impress there?
Not me, I hope?
Perhaps you think
your mother likes it?
Well?
Or maybe it's new style
with your friends?
The gang of baby skinheads!
Is that it?
Listen, seriously:
don't go imagining
that no one loves you
in your pubescent self-destruction.
But we have to honor
our agreements.
And as long as you're
half-way intelligent
-- and you're not going to
tell me that you're not --
you only need to respect
the rules of the game
if you want others
to respect them as well.
Especially since this doesn't
really cost you anything...
You think teachers
will take pity on you?
this...
concentration camp look?
My dear fellow!
Do you know how long
it will take
for you to regain
a human face?
What a treat
to see you like this!
Stay there, I'm talking to you.
I bore you
when I talk to you, eh?
Can I go now?
... lost in four sets,
6-1, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2.
That's it in sports.
But I really did it!
So? Where is it?
I lent it to him.
So? Where is it?
I don't know
what he's talking about.
He came to borrow it yesterday.
It's true! I swear.
Right, if you think
you can
take me for an idiot,
well...
Hey, are you crazy?
Okay. Take your things
and go see the principal.
I'm not letting young punks
create havoc
in my course.
Tomorrow, I want to see
one of your parents.
Understood?
Croatian soldiers pillaged
some Serbian barracks,
taking away weapons and ammunition.
The last Serbian soldiers
had left unexpectedly.
Serbian retreat
or reorganization of forces?
Listen, stop this foolishness,
okay?
- Squeeze it.
- What does this mean?
- Scaredy-cat.
- Or we'll take away the TV.
- Change the channel!
- Leave it, Georg!
You're the scaredy-cat.
Just squeeze it.
Scaredy-cat.
What's the matter?
Stay there.
I'll help you, come...
I'll help you...
Hey, be quiet.
Be quiet.
Stop, stop screaming,
please!
Be quiet, I beg you!
You didn't know her before?
No.
She went to your high school?
I don't think so, no.
Did anyone see you together?
Anyone who knows you.
Or knows her.
I dunno.
I don't think so.
Talking to you is
like pulling teeth.
Did anyone see you
in the building?
In the elevator, in the halls...
I don't think so.
It was afternoon.
Anna, please...
Have you told anyone?
Look at me.
- Have told you anyone about this?
- No.
- Really?
- No.
It's very important.
Do you swear to me?
Yes.
Did you talk to anyone afterwards?
Over the weekend?
Ricci called.
Did he notice anything?
We wanted to go out that night.
And then?
We went to P1 .
Then, I spent the night at his house.
And you didn't say anything?
Who else might have noticed
something?
No idea.
I'm hungry.
You went to school today?
- Yes.
- And?
Was there talk of
the girl's disappearance?
She doesn't go to our school.
Yes, that's right.
You need to see
Mr. Schober.
What? Who's that?
You or mom.
Our computer teacher.
Why?
Ricci said I had his notebook.
I socked him one.
What?
I hit him.
Okay, but I don't see
the connection.
Schober sent me to the principal
and he asked for you
to come see him.
And the principal,
what did he say?
Nothing. I didn't go.
Will you be able to sleep?
Of course.
You'd better not
go to school tomorrow.
You should have something to eat
and then go to bed.
Right...
- What do we do with...
- I don't know...
Are you scared?
No.
Can you leave the door open?
And the den's too?
Yes! Good night.
They won't do anything to him
if it's an accident.
With a body
full of holes?
That's completely absurd.
You want to hand him over
to the police?
I don't know.
I'm trying to figure it out...
Try also to stay calm.
I know this is difficult
but, please!
What are the arguments in favor:
First...
Benny is a minor.
I don't see any others...
And the arguments against?
The kid was alone,
without supervision...
He fired several shots.
How did he get hold of...
the slaughter gun?
Negligence
of supervisory duty.
Even if we get out of it,
and that's more than doubtful,
the best he can hope for,
is a mental institution.
With that, do you realize
his life is ruined? No?
Leaving aside
aggravating circumstances...
There's really nothing better
to polish his corporate image...
How can we avoid
handing him over?
First...
Elimination of the...
Look, get a hold of yourself.
It's absolutely useless
to fall apart.
Yes, you're right. Okay.
First...
If Benny really hasn't told anyone,
and I believe him,
and if there are no witnesses,
in the building, or at school,
who would suspect the child?
How do you think
you'll go about this?
I think nothing.
And how do you want to
get the body out of the apartment?
And put it where?
Without leaving any trace.
When you bury something,
it can resurface.
We can burn the personal things.
Where?
We could take them to the farm.
So, cut her in pieces...
Pieces so small
we can get them out.
And the bones?
I don't know.
Break them, saw them,
burn them too...
- Do you know what you're saying?
- What we're saying.
Okay. What we're saying.
You're speaking seriously?
I don't know.
You have another idea?
We should try to sleep.
Yes...
We don't have
a lot of time.
Do you think this is possible?
You think you can take this?
I don't know.
Try to imagine what this means.
Will you be able
to suppress your disgust?
The pieces will have to be
tiny enough
not to clog the pipes.
I have no idea
how much time this could take.
And we don't have
a lot of time.
It's already been two days.
- And if someone comes?
- Like who?
We won't let anyone in.
And Benny?
I have no clue!
Call him in sick.
Send him somewhere. Doesn't matter.
He can't be here during this.
And what if they find
the skeleton in the closet?
- How?
- Well, however.
I don't know.
I can't force you.
I'm no more confident than you.
What about this one?
One moment...
Yes. But the flight
departs only on the 16th.
That's in four days.
No. We'll take Egypt.
Agreed?
He didn't tell me about it.
Yes, he's rather shy.
How old was your mother?
Almost 80.
I see. And she lived there alone?
Yes, a friend of hers
had a flat in Hourghada.
And after my father's death,
my mother went to join her.
She's the one who called me.
Two years of jail for
fraud of several millions!
The old magistrate
declares herself not guilty
Gorbachev won't give up
without a fight
Last attempt
to stop the fall of the USSR
A cold snap
paralyses eastern Austria.
Do you want anything else?
I'm returning these.
Any news?
Not today.
Evi called.
You went to see her Sunday.
Yes.
You said you spoke to no one.
- No, no one.
- You spoke to her friends.
I was looking for her.
Did you happen to tell her?
- Who else did you speak to?
- No one.
You didn't tell me
about Evi's friends.
What else did you hide?
Nothing.
You mustn¬ít lie,
do you understand?
You can't afford to anymore.
Do you understand
what I mean?
The water has a
very high salt concentration.
Up to four percent.
The surface temperature
can reach
34 degrees in the summer.
But the average normal
water temperature
is around 22 degrees.
Where does the name Red Sea
come from?
Some scientists say
it comes from seaweeds
which give a red color to the water.
You can see it very clearly
from the coast.
But others say
that it comes
from the name of the Erythrean people
which means red,
"Hamair."
Can't you sleep?
It's too light outside.
Would you like me
to close the curtains?
I dunno.
How do you feel?
Fine.
Fine.
Do you like it here?
I dunno.
It's hot.
Yes.
What are you thinking about?
Nothing.
About nothing.
We'll go swimming tomorrow,
okay?
Early.
While there's still
no one on the beach.
Just the two of us.
There are only old people here.
Why do you say that?
Just because.
Okay. Sleep now.
It was a tiring day.
'Night.
'Night.
'Night, Benny.
'Night.
Mom!
I'm flying!
Greetings from dad.
How is he?
Fine.
Get yourself together.
I'm hot.
Well, get out of the shot, at least.
You over there, please come back.
We're leaving.
Damn it, stop!
Go away!
The highest number begins...
by using two numbers
from the first plane.
Then...
Then, each player
rolls two dice.
There.
So I start.
Shall we go for a swim?
We've been here
for four days now.
Mom is taking a bath...
and I got sunburned.
The newspapers still
aren't talking about it...
Or else mom
doesn't want to tell me.
In the papers we find here,
there's nothing.
Day after tomorrow,
we fly back...
I'm curious to see
if dad will manage it.
Actually, a week...
is a long time.
Mom, what is it?
They made some changes
to the computer system
and nothing works anymore.
I dread what's awaiting me
at work tomorrow.
But I'm talking about myself...
- You look terrific.
- Yes. The weather was great.
Benny got sunburned.
Nothing serious. It's over.
She says her plane is almost full.
I didn't know she was
so tenacious.
When's this party?
Friday.
But it's up to you.
- There's the concert at school.
- Oh yeah!
Hurry up, Benny.
It's already late.
Starting tomorrow,
you have to get up early again.
'Night. Sleep tight.
No TV today, okay?
I'm glad you're back.
Me too.
Good.
I love you.
Go on. Sleep well.
I think everything's
in order now.
You no longer need
to be afraid.
I wanted to ask you something...
Yes?
Why...
did you do it?
What?
I dunno...
I wanted to see
what it's like...
I suppose.
What's what like?
Yes.
You're not going to the store?
Later.
It's nicer to eat together.
Anyway, I can open later.
She had an apartment in Luxor,
right on the banks of the Nile.
Are you keeping it?
I dunno.
That'd be cool.
The weather was crazy.
You can't imagine
how hot it is right now.
- Did you see her again?
- The full amount.
What?
- Did you see her again?
- Who?
- Your grandmother.
- No.
Here you are.
The funeral took place right away.
The caterer.
We're bringing the canap√©s.
... received.
But to achieve this rank,
you need eight people
to fill your plane.
- How much to pay?
- 10,000.
How do you find
eight people
with 10,000 schillings?
Please,
fasten your seatbelts.
- The last...
- The last passenger.
One... two... three...
Who'd have believed my daughter
was a businesswoman?
You too,
you could launch your plane.
- That's all we need.
- No, really.
Seriously.
There are games
with enormous sums.
Evi thinks we should try it
with our friends.
In Munich,
they launched a plane
with 100,000 marks at stake.

- Like who?
We won't let anyone in.
And Benny?
I have no clue!
Call him in sick.
Send him somewhere. Doesn't matter.
When did you start missing school?
The next day.
But we flew out
a day later.
- When did you return?
- After a week.
- And you couldn't see anything?
- No.
There was no trace?
No.
- Everything was back in order.
- Yes.
You didn't ask
where the deceased was?
No.
You didn't speak of this
to anyone?
No.
And why are you spilling
all this now?
Just because.
Do you know who the girl was?
No.
And where are you parents now?
My father is at the office.
Mom in the store.
Can you give us their address?
My father: Intercom.
Seventh district.
3a Neubaugasse.
My mother: Kunstrepro Belvedere.
Third district.
16 Rennweg.
May I go now?
Excuse me.
