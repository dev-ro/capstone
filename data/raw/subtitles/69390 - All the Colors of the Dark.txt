Jane!
You didn't take your pills again...
C'mon... be a good girl... drink up.
And now try and get some sleep.
Please, Richard, stay here with me.
I have to be in Oxford
at 10 in the morning.
I have to check out all the
forms... l'll be busy for a while.
No Richard! Please, don't leave, please!
Ok, I'll wait here
until you fall asleep.
I can't! I can't!
Jane! Please Jane, look at me!
Oh Richard, help me, please!
C'mon Jane... calm down!
No thanks... Oh damn, it's late!
I'm missing the 8:40 train.
I'm very sorry to leave you alone.
Barbara's supposed to call me later...
I bet she'll tell you about
her psychiatrist again!
She thinks he could help me...
Sure! He's a quack like all the
others, always spouting Freud.
Trying to pull you in
with the same old nonsense!
You shouldn't talk like
that about Dr. Burton.
After all Barbara works with him and
if she appreciates him, it means that...
Oh, sure. I have no
problems with your sister
but please Jane, leave
psychoanalysis out of it!
But Richard... you don't know what
happens to me when I'm sleeping!
It's just weakness. Your body is
still weak after the operation.
You don't think I know how you
feel about losing your baby?
The baby was also mine
and I suffered too!
Goodbye dear... come back soon!
Goodnight, love. It
was a fantastic evening.
All the same Richard should be grateful
to you. If you hadn't helped him
with that psycho-technical exam,
he would never have got his job.
Obviously he holds me responsible
for what happened after that...
What do you mean?
Having introduced him to you.
What's the stuff he gives to you?
A concentration of vitamins. I
feel sick when I take them but...
I think Richard takes
himself too seriously.
After all he's just a pharmaceutical
salesman, not a doctor.
Don't judge him badly.
He just wants to help me.
Giving you all those vitamins?
Taking so many vitamins without
medical supervision could be dangerous.
I don't know what to do... I know he
loves me, but he can't understand me.
Day after day, it's like
I'm falling into a pit.
This is nonsense, Jane! You
need a good psychiatrist.
That's why I set up an
appointment with Dr. Burton
Sit down dear, he'll
see you in a minute.
Jane, come in.
That woman was your mother?
Yes.
How old were you?
Five.
I don't know if you know
this, but you began treatment
right where it usually ends.
That is, from the trauma you
suffered during childhood.
Don't you think this is a good sign?
I'd like to believe you,
but is that really the case?
It's only an interview. Ever spoken
with your husband about this problem?
Well... Richard isn't... Richard
and I aren't married yet.
And that stops you
from confiding in him?
No but... you see, he wouldn't understand.
In his opinion everything comes
from the car accident that...
...where I lost my baby.
Stillborn?
Yes.
And from that moment you couldn't
have full sexual relations, right?
Yes, that's right, but it isn't
the car accident, or even the memory
of the baby that stops
me. It's the other thing.
The man with the knife?
Yes, but how can I tell that to Richard?
He'd probably end up hating me. His
life with me is already so difficult...
and I don't want to lose
him. I have to get better.
Are you afraid of the dark?
No.
Tell me, have you ever felt
you were living out your dreams?
Yes. In the waiting room, there
was a man... your patient I suppose.
He looked at me with the same
eyes that are in my nightmare.
Are you really sure?
He was sitting in the other room!
I'm sorry to contradict you, but I
never have my patients wait together.
Come with me please.
But... he was here. I'm
sure of that. He's gone.
Apparently.
You saw him, right? He was
here, sitting in this armchair.
Yes, sure. He asked for you, but
he wasn't one of your patients.
I told him to wait. Maybe
he was tired of waiting.
I must apologize, Miss. You
were right, there was someone.
However, the point is that, whoever
he was, you were scared of him.
In our next meeting we must
find out why that happened.
When can I come back, Doctor?
Barbara will take care
of the appointment.
For the moment I suggest that you
stop taking your husband's vitamins.
You are not ill by any means. You
must convince yourself of that.
Your worst enemy is loneliness.
Consider yourself neither crazy
nor someone who's seeing things.
Real madmen never think
of themselves as crazy.
What do you want from me!
Excuse me.
I can open the door if you want.
After you. I live on
the top floor, and you?
I live on the third floor, thanks. I've
only been here a few days. I'm Mary.
I'm Jane. Nice to meet you.
I've been living here for three
months and I hardly know anyone.
Here in the city it's
hard to make friends.
We people from the suburbs
haven't learned not to be nosy yet.
Would you like some tea? Tea
for me is still a social ritual
I hate having it alone.
I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't.
Waiting for someone?
You're very kind, but my husband
is tired when he gets home from work
and I have to make dinner.
Well I don't want to force you,
but it's early. It's only 5 o'clock!
Ok, I'll have some tea.
Make yourself at home.
Don't stand there, come in.
At the door you seemed
very scared, am I right?
It's true. Someone
was following me here.
Me, I'm scared of the time when
men won't follow me any more!
How do you know he was a man?
Men have been following
women since the world began.
With or without a club.
It's very nice here. How
did you fix it up so quickly?
It was already like this. I prefer them
already furnished. I just add the mess.
More cookies?
No thanks, I have to go.
I'd like to prepare something fro
Richard that's not out of a can.
Mary, why don't you come have
dinner with us? I'd like that.
Absolutely not! I don't want to
come between a couple of newlyweds.
Ok. See you tomorrow. Richard
goes to work and I'm all alone.
Would you like have lunch together?
Sure. Here at my place.
I can even make something
that's not out of a can.
We could go shopping together... OK?
Right. So... l'll see you
at 10 tomorrow morning.
Yes, thanks. Bye, Mary.
Hello?
Miss Jane Harrison?
Yes, who's speaking?
I'm Franciscus Clay, a
lawyer. I must see you.
See me?
Yes. Can you come to my
office tomorrow at 3:30?
Wait a second...
The address is Rolands House 5
So I'll expect you.
But... what about? Hello?
The eggs!
Jane! What's going on?
Good evening.
I would have preferred you ask my
advice before taking her to Dr. Burton.
I don't believe in psychoanalysis.
I've never seen anybody come out cured.
On the contrary I think it's just a way
of convincing people that the
world is populated only by madmen.
Go on... your logic is amusing.
You should take less care of Jane
and more of yourself, Barbara.
Sorry, could you pass me the
dress on the chair please?
Why do you hide yourself
under this stuff?
You surprise me, Richard. Think I can
still take your compliments seriously?
This time it's not even so you can get
a good recommendation
for a lousy salesman job.
You've never forgiven
me for that, have you?
Janet will continue with Dr. Burton
with or without your permission.
Have you ever asked yourself why
Janet hasn't agreed to marry you yet?
I've thought about it for a long time.
And I'm sure it's partly your
fault too. You treat her like a baby
who still can't make
a decision on her own.
Jane is still a slave to her
childhood. Maybe that's also my fault
but at the moment you don't give her
the reassurance she's looking for.
You and your stupid
psychoanalysis books!
Why are you blaming other
people for what's your fault?
It's all your fault even
according to your own crude logic!
If you hadn't hit that tree with your
car, Janet wouldn't have problems now!
I often walk in this
park. I like the solitude.
Hear the birds? They are
complaining about our being here.
They're very resentful, you know.
Not as much as men are. This
might sound strange to you, Mary
but I'm sure that someone is
chasing me. Someone coming very deep
from my childhood. Do you
believe in that sort of thing?
I believe in a lot more.
Don't worry about it... c'mon!
I had my problems too, not like
yours, but maybe more serious.
But I got rid of them.
How?
Do you know what a Black Mass is?
You're scaring me...
It makes sense to be afraid
sometimes. You have to find it
and it'll disappear.
But... what do you want from me?
Me?
See? You look like a scared
little baby without her mom.
Do you really want to get well?
It's all I want.
Don't think about psychiatrists
anymore. I know the right person for you.
Who?
My friends don't like questions. The
just want trust. They're waiting for you.
When?
Do you really want to come?
When?
Even tonight if you want...
I have a meeting with a
lawyer who called me yesterday.
Make sure to be back home at
5.30. I'll be out at the door.
Why so late? What happened? We
can't be so late getting there.
But... what's the matter?
That man I was talking
about... he tried to...
Rape you?
Kill me!
I think it's better put off for
another time... let's go to my house.
No... l'm afraid I'm going crazy!
Let's go where you wanted, right now.
But you drive. I couldn't.
Ok.
Oh Richard, my love, my dear love!
Now everything's like before, Jane.
Yes but... I don't know... lt
doesn't seem real to me...
And me? Do you think I'm real?
Tomorrow I'll take the day off. We'll
go out to lunch. Would you like that?
When I told Barbara that I'm not
going to Burton anymore she hung up.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Sorry, I have to phone a client.
You're here! Can you tell
me what happened to you?
What are you hiding behind you?
So now you rummage in my books...
And you? You read this stuff now?
I bought it in a used bookstore. Could
you explain why you ran away like that?
And where were you?
The phone was broken. I had a phone
meeting with a client in Liverpool.
I had to call him from another phone
nearby... what's so odd about that?
Nothing... nothing...
Welcome back, Jane.
We were expecting you.
She offers herself to you!
Free from her fears... forever!
You're free, Jane.
Now that woman doesn't exist
any more. She gave you to us.
Now she's free not to exist.
No, Mary!
It's time to say goodbye, Jane. Be happy!
No, Mary, I don't want to!
