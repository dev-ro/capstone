Lake Jindabyne filled in the 1970s...
No, it wouldn't be as dry
as what it was last year.
She's off to the races
She's walking on air
She's trying on dresses
And brushing her hair
Now she makes an appearance
At the top of the stairs
She's off to the races
At the Jindabyne Fair
Her eyes tell a story
She's been dreaming all year
She walks like a duchess...
Something under your car!
Pull over! Something under your car!
Something underneath!
Something under your car!
Come on, stop, you fucking bitch!
It all comes down from the power station.
Electricity.
Who's my main man?
Okay.
Come on, tiger, let's go.
There's fish awaiting.
Come on.
Put your shoes on.
That's it, pull.
Pull.
- Can you feel it?
- Yeah, it's heavy!
Yeah, do you want me to help you?
- I can do it!
- You can do it? Okay.
Oh, man! It's so exciting.
Look, it's coming. It's...
Wow! That's a funny-looking fish.
- It's a piece of junk.
- It's a clock-fish.
- I wonder who that belonged to. Still going.
- What do you mean?
- Is it still going?
- Yeah, it is.
Out there, underneath that water,
is the town
where all the old men sit in rocking chairs.
There's houses and shops.
But you know what? There was a night
when I was out here
and it was really dark and stormy,
and I heard this noise...
And it was a bell coming from
under the water
because the old church is still down there.
And sometimes, when the water's really low,
you can see the tip of the spire.
- I think I can see it now.
- Can you see it now?
- Can you hear the bell?
- I can a little bit.
When can I come fishing with you for real?
When you learn to swim.
I told you that before.
- See that mountain over there?
- Yeah.
I'm going to take you to a river
that's on the other side of that mountain.
And we'll fish there.
- Jude.
- What?
Jude, she's not in her bedroom.
Caylin-Calandria!
What are you doing with this?
What are you up to now, Caylin-Calandria?
- How long have you been out here?
- Caylin-Calandria!
Mom, Mom, Mom,
I caught an Atlantic salmon.
- Dad says I can cook it myself.
- No, no way. Just...
Go jump in the shower,
I'll make you some toast.
- Please.
- Go on, do as you're told.
What's wrong?
I don't want to deal with fried food
this morning.
I didn't have the heart to tell him
to throw it back in again.
He seemed to be so proud of it.
You know the way it is.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Tom.
- Hi.
In you go.
Seat belt, please.
- Bye, Nan.
- See you later.
Can I see yours?
Excited about the weekend?
- Yeah, it'll be great.
- Yeah, it'll be great.
Looking forward to it.
- Sorry to barge in so early.
- No worries.
I shouldn't be eating this crap.
Just clench your fist for me a few times.
All right.
Let's see if you are pregnant
before we start panicking.
I must be. I never get sick.
Claire, stop imagining the worst.
Stewey was telling me
it's the big fish-a-thon this weekend.
Now Peggy's been nagging me
to take her fishing, you know.
Last weekend, I took her up to Myall Lakes
for the evening rows.
What if it happens again?
It won't.
Besides, this time we're prepared.
I'm so looking forward to some time out.
If I hear one more word about fishing...
Only three more deliveries,
but they're all out on the plain.
Why don't you invite me over
for a home-cooked meal
while Stewey's away?
Let me consider your generous offer
and get back to you.
No.
You're way too close to the ground
back here.
You're gonna bash him on the ground.
You're breaking your wrist open.
Just keep it hard up
against your wrist there.
- Hey, Rocco.
- Morning.
- Hey, Billy.
- Morning.
Very flash. Thought you were broke.
I am.
Beautiful.
- Fast action.
- Very.
- Can't wait to get to that river.
- Some of us have work to do.
- Well, don't worry about that, miss I'll do it.
- Thank you.
- There you are. How are you going?
- Good, thank you.
It's time to say goodbye to Jindabyne
It's been my home these 50 years of time
Now the longfins in their winter snow
and the Snowy River down below
Is whispering farewell to Jindabyne
In the southeastern corner
of New South Wales,
the old town of Jindabyne
was an historic landmark.
With the inception of the Snowy scheme,
the town was moved
to a position on higher land
to make way for the rising waters
backed up by the dam
constructed in the valley.
One of the older residents
of the township is Mr Tom Weston.
I was born in Jindabyne, you know.
But I come to Beranghi for a while.
- And then me father shipped me to Lismore.
- I see.
Mrs Rankin, how do you feel
about leaving the old town?
Oh, well, there's sentimental reasons,
of course, why you feel a bit sad.
But when you get better conditions,
you think to yourself, "I'm better off."
Finally, on the 19th of December, 1964...
Lunch.
Go on. I won't tell Claire.
I fished it out this morning
from the drowned town.
I've been there.
- I've been there, too.
- Not all the way.
My dad says there's old men down there.
I know.
Zombies. When you drown, they get you.
You have to be their slave.
I touched one once. It licked my foot.
Its tongue was green slime.
Poison.
But I kicked him in the head and got away.
Come on. Don't be a baby.
And don't forget the knife.
- He won't swallow it.
- You're hurting him.
We can't offer him up if he's awake!
If you want my opinion,
it smells like air freshener.
You are truly a horrible man.
Phone Carmel.
There's been an incident at the school.
- Tom could be expelled for bringing a knife.
- I made him.
What on earth were you
going to do with that?
It's private.
Private!
I'll give you private, you're seven years old.
Kids, this is very serious.
You know what? If Tom's expelled,
I'm sending you to the orphanage.
Excellent.
None of the other kids saw them.
I might be able to contain this.
Contain what?
We're talking about a dead rodent.
We're talking about the class pet.
They were supposed to be taking care of it.
Look, Jude, we're talking about a knife
and we're talking about drugs.
I can't believe Tom brought a weapon
to school.
Carmel, I'm so sorry.
Claire, this is not a weapon,
it's a fishing knife.
And anyway, we all know
it's not Tom's doing.
Have you considered
grief counselling for Caylin-Calandria?
It might help you and Carl as well.
You know, you can go as a family.
I do not need to get some advice
from some stranger.
We'll buy a new guinea pig tomorrow.
We can't tomorrow.
I'm going to visit Nana.
No, you're not. You're grounded.
- Can I be grounded at Tom's house?
- No.
Yes. It's fine.
Claire, I wouldn't do it to you.
Not for the whole weekend.
We'll ground them in shifts.
Go on, go get your stuff.
- She's getting worse.
- Just give her time.
Time! Show me where you buy some of that.
Your granddaughter's just done
her first murder!
Toilet's blocked again.
Vanessa! Vanessa! Vanessa!
Guess what! Guess what! We're grounded.
- Grounded!
- Gosh! What's that mean?
You're early.
Claire, I don't approve
of women and children
being housebound this weekend.
Well, I'm sorry about that,
but Tom has to take responsibility
for his choices.
Surely he's got another 50 years
to learn that.
Where are the decent glasses?
Packed away.
What's the point of that?
Things are made to be used.
I found that down the back of the cupboard.
You don't have to like it,
you just have to live with it. I did.
- You still smell of petrol.
- Nice hair.
Thanks.
Guess what? Siobhan's left her husband.
A repeat performance. No word. No note.
No point, according to her.
- So you see, it wasn't just you.
- I'm not interested, Mom.
Don't be silly, we all love hearing gossip
about people we hate.
I don't know why you even
keep in touch with her.
I invested time and energy
in that marriage as well as you.
And she's always been good to me.
Tom took a knife to school.
- Well, at least he knows how to handle it.
- Claire, you're overreacting.
- This isn't open for discussion.
- Of course it is.
- You guys sort it out.
- It is sorted.
Sorted.
That hair makes you look like
the kind of man who visits prostitutes.
Do you think she'll come tonight?
She mostly comes when I'm by myself.
Elissa, he's going away a boy,
but he's going to come back a man.
No, thanks, I want him back
just the way he is.
Well, don't let him loose
with this bunch of maniacs.
Hey, come on. You'll wake the baby.
Geez.
- Carl. Carl, take it easy.
- Don't you worry about me.
- We need you fit for tomorrow.
- What's this...
- What? What's what?
- There's something different about you.
- I think he looks very dashing.
- I can't wait. I wish we could go tonight.
The word is dashing.
Elissa, Billy told me that
you've surfed almost
everywhere in the world.
- Is that true?
- Pretty much.
Best place in the world right here, all right.
Actually, I don't like being this far inland.
There's no water.
We got more water
than bloody Sydney Harbour!
There's no waves, though.
You can't surf without a wave.
- In a hidden valley...
- Here we go! Here we go! He's off.
...lies a hidden river.
- Full of blarney.
There dwells a fish
wild and cunning.
A mysterious,
wild...
Elusive.
Stay with it, baby. Stay with it. Keep going.
Mysterious, wild fish.
Fuck. Hurry up, will you?
My arm's falling off.
- Immemorial.
- Age immemorial.
Don't expect me to cook it then.
- As time lies waiting.
- As we are all doing.
Okay, shut up!
Waiting for us.
I knew this speech last year.
Anyway,
- to the Wild One!
- To the Wild One!
- Cheers.
- The Wild One!
Here we go.
Thank Christ he can fish better
than he can talk.
- What's she done now?
- Nothing. She's an angel.
They both are.
We had a powwow,
and we decided we deserve a treat, too.
- Don't panic. We're not gate-crashing.
- No. No, you're not, Mom.
Please, sit down. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.
Well, if you're sure we're not in the way.
No, not at all.
We can build a little cr√®che
down the end of the table for you.
- You can sit on the end.
- I'll sit here.
We grannies must stick together.
I hear you put the frighteners
on a guinea pig today.
All right, let's go.
Claire, sit down.
The children are grounded.
Yeah, I know, but it's the one night,
and we're...
Please, sit down.
Don't spoil it, Claire.
Sorry.
All right, gentlemen. Come on, on your feet.
It's that time of year again.
Get down. Just the beautiful ones.
- Come on, snuggle up!
- You're bloody big for a hooker, aren't you?
All right, look like you're having
a good time.
Carl, you look the best.
Again you coughed. Come on, one more!
- Beautiful.
- Oh, I was...
Oh, it's all right. Don't worry. Wombat!
Oh, all right. One more.
- Wombat.
- Got it.
- What time do you call this?
- I call this morning.
Here. Come on, we have to leave.
- Relax. We're on bloody holiday.
- Okay.
No, I'm still here. Me, too.
For fuck's sake!
It's okay, man, I'll do it. I'll do it.
Got to go.
All right. Bye, bye.
Hey, Billy, put the sign around
the right way, you dope!
Hey, listen, try to avoid the potholes,
will you?
My brain's hanging by a thread.
- What brain?
- I don't know.
I'm never drinking again.
Hi, Elissa!
Hello.
Oh, really.
Okay.
Bye. She loves me.
- Love-struck.
- Hen-pecked.
Thin line.
Too bloody right.
Are you sick?
No, I just ate too much last night.
No, you didn't.
When my mom was sick,
she spewed up green slime.
It was gross.
It wasn't her fault.
She couldn't help it. It was bile.
Everyone has that in their tummy. It's not...
It's not gross. It's natural.
Are you going to die?
No, my love. No one's going to die.
You're stuck with me.
Before I go,
there's something I'd like to say.
No, there's something I'd like to say to you.
You have no authority over my family.
Not any more. It's time you accepted that.
You sound very wound up.
You need to be careful.
I'm fine.
They're my boys, too, Claire.
I didn't come to this godforsaken country
to make a nuisance of myself.
I came because they needed me.
I know that and I'm grateful. We all are.
But that's in the past now.
It's not me that's ridden by the past.
I know you're accustomed
to doing without a mother,
but I'd just like to say
you're like a daughter to me now.
Must you always fight it?
Oh, man!
- I'm not getting any reception.
- You won't get any reception up here, mate.
Not getting anything.
Watch out for snakes, Billy.
Seriously?
God!
Listen to that.
Sorry?
Bloody typical.
Jude forgot to pack my sandwiches.
Do you want some of this?
It's protein. It's good for you.
- Three beautiful women walk into a bar...
- It's always three beautiful women with you.
Now, just listen. Listen.
Blonde, brunette and a lesbian, see,
and the barmaid says...
What colour hair has the lesbian got?
How the fuck do I know? Blue.
Anyway, the barmaid comes...
Elissa used to be a lesbian.
Idiot.
Well, she's not any more.
Anyway, the lesbian says...
- You're out of condition, old man.
- No, I'm not.
Someone just moved the river, that's all.
- I have to show this place to Elissa.
- No, no, no.
No women allowed.
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Jesus.
Jesus. Carl!
Carl! Come here!
Oh, fuck.
Oh, Jesus.
Carl!
Rocco, for fuck's sake, come here!
Where the fuck are you?
Take her!
Take her!
Take her, for fuck's sake! Take her!
Oh, fuck!
- Fuck this!
- Where are you going?
Billy, no, no, no. Billy, no!
I propose that we leave her here.
If she gets carried downstream,
she'll go down to the rapids
and we'll never find her.
Yeah.
No, I agree with that. We should tie her up
in the water. It's freezing.
If you put her out in the sun,
she'd be gone, history.
I don't think we should
ever have touched her.
I mean, it's a crime scene.
And we've disturbed it.
Billy, for fuck's sake, shut up!
My plants! I have to save my plants!
Zombie!
So what the hell am I going to do with her?
I'm losing her, too.
- No, you're not.
- I am. I can feel it.
Hi!
- I invited Carmel.
- Why?
She's Rocco's girlfriend.
We should make her feel comfortable.
- Jude.
- Okay. Okay.
- Hi, Ms D.
- Have you done your homework? Joking.
Look! Look!
- Oh, wow!
- Did you see the cake?
I had big weekend plans. Three DVDs,
the express issue of Vanity Fair,
- and all I've done is sleep.
- Half your luck.
- Mind if I open a window?
- Of course not.
It's a shame we have to baby-sit.
I was all geared up for a good dance.
The pub is packed and jumping.
- Can I have a glass, please?
- Yes.
God, I love dancing. The Bee Gees.
- But what?
- The Bee Gees?
- Yeah.
- You can't be that old!
Hello.
Is that homemade?
Whoa! Homemade.
Can I try?
Yeah, I'll make sure
you get the biggest piece.
Now leave it.
Go on, scoot!
- But...
- You'll get one later. I promise.
She's a handful.
She's her own person.
Just like her mother was.
- Never wanted any of your own?
- Haven't found the perfect man yet.
You're kidding!
Women in this town would queue up
for Rocco.
So I gather.
Actually, I'm starting to wonder
if I can even have kids.
But, hey, maybe Rocco has the mighty seed.
- Rocco was going to be my son-in-law.
- Really?
Once upon a time.
So what about you, Claire?
You obviously love children.
Stewart wouldn't want any more.
Well, who could blame him?
- Have I said something that I shouldn't...
- Of course not.
I wasn't well after Tom was born.
I couldn't look after him,
so it was hard on Stewart.
It must have been hard for you, too.
Claire took off.
- I went to stay with my sister.
- For 18 months.
- You know what...
- So, yeah, it was hard on Stewey.
I've stopped expecting anybody
to understand.
You two should count your blessings.
You're young, you're healthy.
Your family's still in one piece.
People dying in the wrong order,
that's pretty much when it all turns to shit!
- Come on! We're off!
- But the movie!
Come on, Mom. Let's get you back
to the veggie patch. Come on.
Come on.
Jude. Jude, put her down.
- Come on. Put her down, put her down.
- You're not going anywhere.
Come on. Come on.
You all right?
I'm sorry. I'm just so tired.
What's wrong
with the fucking Bee Gees anyway?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
There's nothing wrong with the Bee Gees.
Piss off!
We love the Bee Gees.
The greatest musical artists ever.
We love them.
Okay, look. See that rise over there?
Okay, you're going to reel him in.
Now set it up.
Fantastic. Okay. Now take your time.
Play him in.
That's it.
Okay, now!
That's it. Let him fight. Let him fight.
Let him fight.
Come on. You got him. You've got him.
You got him.
That's it.
Yes!
- Could have scooped him up with one hand.
- Sure you could.
- Which one's dinner?
- Not mine. Mine's coming home with me.
- All right. Hold it up. I'll get a photograph.
- Hang on.
Trout with stunned mullet.
Okay. Hold it up.
Can't wait to get back to that river.
I can. I'm rooted.
I feel really trippy.
Too much sun.
I've never known anything like it.
Something's put the river spirits
in a good mood.
Look, I don't care what you guys do,
but I'm gonna leave tomorrow morning.
Hey, how are you?
I'm okay.
We found a body.
I caught the most amazing fish, though.
What?
Yeah.
No problem.
Yeah. Goodbye.
Fuck.
- Cops want us to stay here.
- What'd they say?
Nothing. What would they say?
Well, the lesbian told Billy
not to bother bringing his fish home.
We got to get this story straight.
Let's just go under together, okay?
All right? You ready? Hang on.
I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.
We go under on three. All right?
One... Hold your breath.
Two, three. Here we go.
Good boy.
Oh, that was so good, though!
You don't want to it again, do you?
- No.
- No. Okay. But good boy.
I'm going to swim out. I'll be right back.
You stay right there.
Tom!
Are you all right? What did that man say?
"Which way to the motel?"
Did you catch anything?
You smell like fish.
You're so soft.
So warm.
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!
What? What? What?
- Police.
- What? What?
- Police.
- Who is it?
Police.
What's going on?
Morning, Claire,
just need a word with Stewart.
Stewart!
Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.
We just need you
to answer a few more questions, Stewart.
- Yeah, okay.
- What's going on?
- Could you come down...
- Yeah, I said okay. I said I'll come, all right?
Okay.
Hello.
- No, I don't have any bloody comment!
- What is going on?
We...
- We found a body.
- Where?
In the river.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be all right.
You look after Mom, you hear me?
Be back in a moment.
We don't step over bodies in order
to enjoy our leisure activities.
Pack of bloody idiots. I'm ashamed of you.
The whole town's ashamed of you.
Here's Claire.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I don't understand. When did they find her?
What did Stewart tell you?
Not much. There really wasn't time.
Bastard!
Billy and I were up all night talking about it.
So, are you going to charge us
with something or not, Jimbo?
Get out!
Go on! Piss off!
Here they come.
Here they come. Come on.
We never destroyed any evidence.
Billy!
- Get out of here, you bastard!
- Carl!
The body's been washed
a long way down the stream.
You told the police that?
You found her on Friday? It's Monday.
Oh, please.
- We're just the bloody meat in the sandwich.
- Carl.
- Jesus, Carl twisted his ankle.
- Honestly, Carl could hardly walk.
I couldn't leave the guys without a car.
It would've been irresponsible.
Anyway, we'll discuss this later.
I'll see you. Okay.
You're saying she's a blackfella?
- I told you that.
- No, you didn't.
- Of course I did!
- No.
I'm sure I told you.
You couldn't have said it very loudly,
if you said it at all.
I'll get the facts for meself.
- What's going on, Rocco?
- I'm sure I told her.
What happened out there?
What did Stewart tell you?
Carl bunged-up his ankle.
He's not up to it any more. You know that.
Look...
I've got a really busy day.
Don't worry.
I'll make sure Carmel's all right.
Could you have left her there, Terry,
and gone fishing?
I hate fishing.
You think we did the wrong thing
by that girl?
No, she didn't care what we did.
She's got no opinion,
no feelings one way or the other.
She's dead.
Hey.
It's good to be home.
Tom's still up.
He needs to ask you some questions.
Was it scary?
No.
It was sad.
What did the dead lady look like?
She looked like she was... She was asleep.
Caylin-Calandria says she has
no clothes on.
Caylin-Calandria doesn't know
as much as she thinks she knows.
Was the dead lady under the water
where it's deep?
Your dad took her out of the water
and he wrapped her up in a sleeping bag
and he made her all nice and warm
and cosy.
Caylin-Calandria says that
there's a serial killer.
She says he's coming after you.
Now listen.
You don't pay attention to anything
anybody says, no matter what they say.
The river is a very long, long way away.
And there are no bad men here.
Okay?
Now, go to sleep.
I didn't want to upset you.
I thought it could wait till this morning.
What really happened out there?
I told you.
Nothing happened. We just...
We got stuck, that's all.
Geez, I don't know what the fuss is about.
I really don't.
What if it had been Tom in the water?
But it wasn't Tom. It was a stranger.
I wish you wouldn't keep dwelling on this.
You're gonna make yourself sick again.
- I didn't make myself sick!
- I didn't mean...
People don't make themselves sick!
It's something that happens to you.
Something bad that happens to you.
I just want you to be okay. That's all.
Jesus, I'm sorry I mentioned it.
Last night, how could you have touched me
like that? After finding her?
Claire, I am so exhausted.
- She needed your help.
- She didn't need my help.
She was beyond help. There was...
There was nothing anybody
could do for her.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Sorry you're late?
Where did they get this information from?
- Jesus!
- Yeah, Jesus!
Do not give these people
any more information.
We have to stick together on this.
I wonder who she belongs to.
Was she raped?
There was some bruising.
- Then again, maybe she was up for it.
- Why would you even think that?
You see this cut around her ankle
down to the bone?
Stewart did that
when he tethered her to a tree.
Too lazy to walk back up to the road.
Then again, maybe they just got off
on the whole thing.
- I haven't seen you before.
- No, I...
How can I help you?
What would I need to do if I wanted
to terminate a pregnancy?
We ask St. Brigit
to protect this fine house for another year.
- Bless this house that holds this cross.
- Bless this house that holds this cross.
- Protect it night and day.
- Protect it night and day.
- And those who dwell within
- And those who dwell within
- Protect us from all harm, we pray.
- Protect us from all harm, we pray.
Amen.
- Put it on over.
- I'm confused, hold on.
- This finger with that.
- Like that.
It's my best batch yet.
Are you still throwing up?
No.
You know, our children are God's way
of telling us how much he loves us.
Police have tonight released the identity
of a Ngarago girl found murdered
in the Kosciusko National Park.
SBS warns indigenous viewers
that this report
contains the name of a deceased person.
The body of 19-year-old Susan O'Connor...
Don't answer that.
...was found late Friday in a remote area
of the park by a group of local fishermen.
But it was not reported to police
until the following Sunday.
She went to the country music festival.
Now we don't think she ever got there.
They're animals.
I don't know how any civilised human being
could do what they did.
And I really wonder how differently
they would've acted if she were white!
Oh, God.
Here we go.
- I went and saw her today.
- What?
In the hospital, in the mortuary.
What the hell for?
You tethered her to a tree.
I did it for her own safety.
Besides, you weren't even there!
The sooner they find
the person responsible, the better.
Then all this blame can go where it belongs!
Give me that. Tom has to go now.
I hate this vase, Vanessa.
Oh, Jesus.
You don't have to do that.
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Come on, boy. Come on.
- Just like old times.
- Yeah, just like the old times, yeah.
- Murderous bastard!
- You arsehole!
Bullshit. I want something done about it.
- Yeah, well, I'm not filing a complaint.
- Why the hell not?
Because you started it.
Started what? Did I murder anybody?
Did I destroy anybody's property?
No, you just managed
to make a tragic situation far worse.
Oh, I didn't realise it was your job
to enforce the
political correctness laws, Jimbo.
I would've thought, out of all the people
in this town,
you would be the one
who could understand what her family
is going through right now.
We do understand.
That does not make us responsible!
Carmel.
What's wrong?
You went to the hospital.
I needed to see her for myself.
I can't believe you behaved
so disrespectfully to her and to her family.
Would you walk into a stranger's house
while they were asleep
and have a good old perv at them?
Of course not.
The spirit hasn't gone anywhere.
Dead doesn't mean dead.
- I understand that.
- Do you?
I need to know what happened out there.
Shit happened. Like it always does.
Well, then I have to face it
and not look away.
- Claire, this isn't about you.
- It's about all of us.
Isn't it, Carmel?
I mean, who are we?
- Stewey.
- Hi, Terry.
- Busy morning?
- Yeah.
Yeah, busy enough.
Hi.
We have to sort this out, Claire.
We have to move on.
Look, I was worried that
the girl would be dragged down
to the rapids.
Carl's ankle was fucked. He couldn't walk.
There was no way we could hike back.
The kid was freaking out.
It was just...
There was nothing we could do.
I don't see why I have to justify myself
to you.
Claire?
What if you'd found a boy in the river?
Wouldn't you have taken him out
and covered him up?
What?
What are you talking about?
- You don't know?
- No, I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know where you're going with this.
You're not making any sense.
Of course not.
That's because I'm the unstable one.
Well, let's face it, Claire, you're not exactly
behaving rationally...
- Oh, for fuck's sake!
- Aren't I?
Bitch.
What?
What? What?
Come on, leave it.
What have you got to say?
Please go back to the car.
Claire, go back to the car!
What?
It's okay. Back to the car.
- Please go back to the car.
- Let me go.
Come on.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry, the bogeyman's home.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Tom and I are collecting money
to pay for Susan O'Connor's funeral.
We all know how important it is to be
a real community at a time like this.
Tom.
Please help.
They're our neighbours.
These people look after their own.
And quite frankly, Claire,
I think that's what you should be doing.
Stop!
Sorry.
That was close.
Listen to me.
When a bad thing happens,
we all have to do a good thing,
no matter how small. All right?
Otherwise, the bad things,
they pile up and they...
Hey, come on, come on.
Is Carmel still angry?
You have to make sure
she comes on Saturday.
- Maybe we should cancel it this year.
- No! No! It's what we all need.
Just promise me.
Promise me you'll both come.
That's cheating.
Okay, almost got it.
Can't trust a town
where the publican doesn't live in the pub.
So, just keep your arm straight.
Don't bend your elbow. Go on.
- You did that on purpose!
- Give us a look.
Get off me, you dyke!
Elissa.
- What happened to you?
- I hit Caylin-Calandria.
It was by accident.
Given up drinking altogether, have we,
Miss Muppet?
Oh, Carmel's here.
Oh, thank God.
We can finally all sit down and talk.
Claire, leave it alone.
- Let it heal over.
- We need to get this all sorted.
Don't tell me what I need.
I need life to get back to bloody normal,
whatever that is.
And I don't need you begging all over town
on my behalf.
Carmel.
And I don't need you dragging
my granddaughter miles out of her way
to rub her nose in more bloody misery.
Hi.
Well, they actually think
it might be the same guy that...
From last time, from '79,
but they didn't have any DNA back then.
Oh, can we change the frigging subject,
just for once?
Why?
Apparently, there are secret places
in these mountains.
That's right. Secret men's business.
You men shouldn't even
be going fishing up there.
Give me a fucking break!
Our taxes still pay Parks and Wildlife
the last I heard.
Yeah, well, I was told that the
spirits of the dead cross those mountains.
They travel from all over
up to the High Country.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah, I think we broke her journey
by tying her up.
Bullshit.
You know,
I thought Catholics were superstitious,
but your mob take the biscuit, really.
- Bloody oath!
- I mean, think about it.
It's just a superstition.
You know, journeys, spirits...
Shit!
Oh, Jesus!
- Come here.
- Fuck!
- Come on. Come on, let's get him inside.
- Oh, you fucking prick, Rocco!
Come on.
Carmel!
What was all that, huh? Huh?
I can take care of myself.
Here you go, put some water on it.
Let me have a look. Let me have a look.
Oh, yeah, he needs to go to casualty.
I'll agree, love. I'm half sickened.
I don't wanna go to casualty.
I don't want to go to the hospital.
It's okay, I'll take him.
- No way, you're way over the limit.
- Just get me a mirror.
Claire, Stewart needs to go to the hospital.
Here.
- Here, look.
- Okay.
Dad!
See, you always do it when
the adrenaline's still pumping.
That way you don't feel a thing.
Oh, God.
I'm okay.
Okay.
Don't worry, sweetheart. It'll all be all right.
Crap.
- I don't want to.
- You have to.
Dad, do I have to go
to the dead lady's house?
Her name is Susan.
- You should get that x-rayed.
- I'm late.
- I wanna go with my dad.
- This isn't open for discussion.
He can come with me if he wants.
Here, go on outside and wait for me.
- I've had enough.
- You are piss weak.
I'm sorry, I don't want to intrude.
I just wanted to give you this.
What's this for?
For the funeral.
The whole town wanted to help.
It's not charity.
Are you buying something then?
What's going on here?
This was supposed to be finished yesterday.
Yeah, it'll be done in an hour.
It's a piece of shit anyway.
Just get on with it, will you?
Not now, Tom. I'm flat out.
Hey!
No, I haven't had a chance to talk to him yet.
Just hang on a second.
Tom, this is a private conversation.
Yeah. No, I will. I will.
It's just not the right time.
For some people, going to church
is a bit like going to the dentist.
They'll put up with a lot of toothache
before they'll give in.
If you could just pass this cheque
along to her parents.
The O'Connor family is not
of my congregation.
- They wouldn't welcome my interference.
- I don't understand why this is so hard.
I just want to stay connected to people.
I just want the man I love to be a good man.
What's the verdict?
Whole thing needs rewiring.
Oh, shit.
- Well, give it here, I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.
They're having a special ceremony for her
after the funeral
by the river where the music festival's held.
I wouldn't be welcome.
It's tomorrow afternoon.
Your dad could get a splinter in his brain
if he doesn't go to hospital.
I hate Rocco.
They're all zombies now.
That's such crap, man.
Let's go to the underwater city.
Come on! Tom, come in. It's lovely.
Come on!
Tom!
Tom!
I know you're just pretending.
Tom!
Caylin-Calandria!
Caylin-Calandria!
Caylin-Calandria!
Caylin-Calandria!
Tom!
You did it!
Tom!
What the hell are you two playing at?
Get here.
What are you doing? Get in the car now.
Get in the car. You all right?
Get in the car.
I can't believe you, Caylin-Calandria!
Where'd you think he was?
Stewart! I've got better things to do
than look after your son.
I didn't ask you
to take care of my son, Jude.
Jude! That's enough.
It's not Caylin-Calandria's fault
that she's alive and our girl's dead.
- Hi.
- Hey.
There's a special service being held
for Susan tomorrow.
I think we should go, all of us. Together.
Go home, Claire.
Tom nearly drowned today.
What?
Go home.
Well, Stewart agreed I should move back in
for a while. Just till things settle down.
Guess what, Mom?
I swam.
That's wonderful.
...by National Nine News reporter,
Bethany Jensen.
Bethany, where exactly is...
He should have been with me.
Maybe he should have learned to swim
when he was a baby like every other kid.
Course, you weren't there then,
and you weren't there today.
Oh, no. No.
I'm not the one who's done anything wrong.
- I'm not the one who's lying.
- About what?
- Just tell me.
- Tell you what?
How it felt.
Fishing with her tied up.
Just tell me, how did it make you feel?
Jesus. Can we please leave this alone?
- Can't you just tell me?
- It felt good!
Is that what you want me to say?
It was a beautiful day.
The river was beautiful.
I felt so fucking alive!
Jesus, if that's a crime, I don't know.
I hate the way you do that.
I hate the way you end a conversation
just because you've had enough.
You know something?
Because I have had enough.
I hate the way you guzzle your beer,
you watch TV, you fuck like a robot.
I work like a fucking dog. That's my life!
The beer and the fuck
are supposed to be a bonus!
What kind of man needs that to feel alive?
What kind of man...
What kind of man needs that?
What kind of woman
runs away from her child, eh? Eh?
- What about that? What about fucking that?
- No! Stop it!
- What about that?
- Stewart!
- We never talk about that, do we?
- Stewart, stop it!
- Fuck! Now, what about running away...
- This stops right now!
...running away from your child
like you've done for fucking ages!
- Stop it!
- Listen to me! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
No! No! No! No! Fucking no!
Are you all right?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Where were you? It was mental here today.
I'm sorry, man.
Elissa's really homesick.
So, we're all heading up the coast.
She's going to teach me how to surf.
Great.
Look...
Man, I know it sucks,
me pissing off like this.
Well, what can you do?
People come, people go.
- What do I owe you?
- No, don't worry about it, man. It's fine.
No, no. No, no, I insist.
Well...
- Maybe just the three days.
- There you go.
Thanks, man.
I really appreciate this one.
- Take care.
- Thank you.
Hey, you shake his hand.
Billy!
It doesn't matter, Elissa.
- See you when I get back.
- Claire, talk to Stewey.
I've tried.
But you haven't told him the truth,
have you?
I'm heading over the mountain
to go to Susan's memorial.
I want you to come with me.
I can't. The kid's fucked off.
- Left me high and dry.
- Then close for the day.
I can't just shut up shop for no reason.
Pretend you're going fishing.
I don't know when I'll be back.
I have something I have to sort out.
Yous can all fuck off as far I'm concerned,
but I'll tell you one thing,
whatever happens, nobody is taking my boy.
...the things that you discovered, sir,
over those years
working in the Kosciusko National Park.
The most interesting aspect of it is the...
The wide...
...kind of things you come across.
You obviously then...
Stewart.
Terry.
Hair colour turn out all right, then?
Yeah.
Hey, guys.
Did I break it?
Yeah, yeah.
- Haven't lost my touch then?
- No.
You haven't lost your touch, no.
- Carl reckons Billy's gone.
- Yeah.
Gone off to be a surfer.
That lesbian's not finished
with the poor boy yet.
Half his luck.
What happened out there?
I don't know.
Claire's left me again.
No way.
I reckon you've got it wrong.
See this woman here?
She's married to one of the bastards
who found Susan.
- I'm just here to pay my respects.
- Respects?
What respect?
You better piss off.
- Get out of here!
- You leave her alone.
- Piss off!
- Leave her alone, boy.
- You don't belong here.
- Leave her alone.
Mom!
My name is Stewart Kane.
I was one of the men
who found your daughter.
I'm really sorry, okay?
I came to apologise.
Come on, we're gonna walk
through the smoke
so the spirits don't latch onto us.
This is the last song that Susie ever wrote
before she left us to come here to this place.
She was always falling in love
every couple of weeks.
So it's a love song.
That's what she always gave us.
The way that I love you
Has caught me by surprise
I never knew that my heart
Could open this wide
Letting in your sorrow
Letting out my pain
Filling up with a sweet love
As a lake fills with rain
There's no other I love
The way that I love you
Your kiss makes me feel lighter
Than the eagle on high
Your touch makes me burn brighter
Than the sun in the sky
When I'm riding in the valley
I never feel alone
Be gone.
Walking by the river
I hear you singing...
Be gone.
...on the stones
There's no other I love
The way that I love you
I want you to come home, Claire.
The winds appear in winter
Not fit for beast or man
Come howling round my cabin
Calling out your name
There's no other
I love
The way that I love you
