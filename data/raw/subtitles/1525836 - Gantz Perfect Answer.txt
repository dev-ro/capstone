Part One - Review
Kei Kurono was a
regular college student.
Masaru Kato worked and
supported his little brother.
Childhood friends that were reunited by chance
and...
... died.
Instead of heaven,
they find themselves
in an apartment with
a group of strangers
and a black orb called "GANTZ".
When Gantz assigns a mission,
there is no choice but to follow.
Now go.
Finish off this guy.
Fight the aliens
living among us.

You have no options,
there is no escape.
They are transported to an unfamiliartown...
Without knowing what was going on,
they still fought and managed to win.
When they returned to the room
Gantzgave each of them scores.
They must fight the aliens and earn points,
or they can resurrect one of theirfallen comrades.
Not knowing when Gantz
might summon them again...
they are returned to
theirnormal lives.
Kei begins to thrive on fighting
but Kato stubbornly refuses to fight.
As the missions continue,
more and more Gantz members die.
Eventually, in combat with apowerful alien,
Kato meets his end.
His death devastates Kei.
But with Tae's love, he recovers.
Kei vows to earn 100points and resurrect Kato,
so he keeps fighting the endless battles.

New information on the disappearance of
the subway train casualties.
He's alive.
5 months have passed since the National Museum
was mysteriously destroyed.
The cause is still unknown.
Police suspect terrorism...
- Burger ready?
- Yeah, its ready.
- Thank you!
- Alright.
- Coming through...
- Move it...
Tomato please.
Thanks.
Hello, I'm back!
Oh! Hi Kei.
Homework?
- Done.
- No, Not yet!
Your comic is more interesting.
Kei, is this guy really you?
- He made me tell him.
- Don't worry about it.
Anyway, it's really good.
You should submit it in a contest.
Not yet.
I have to improve some more before I do that.
It's good enough.
Oh no its not...
There are tons of better artists out there.
Relax, You'll do alright.
Aaaah, I wish my brother could read it...
When is he coming home?
Oh, he'll... probably be back soon.
Is he really away for work?
Yes that's right.
Hey, hey! Stop wasting time there.
Where did he really go?
Ayumu's brother...
I can't say.
Ayumu said his brother has disappeared before.
Like that time that he... was arrested...
Kato isn't like that.
Oh, here.
For this month.
You don't have to.
You don't have to pay the rent
for this place all by yourself.
But...
if you could keep visiting Ayumu...
Of course I will.
Otherwise he wouldn't do any of his homework.
And he's a pretty good cook.
Can't deny that.
Besides... if I come here,
I can spend more time with you Kei.
Uh, please don't look at me like that.
I was just... practicing romantic dialogue
it's for my comic you see, so its not really...
Well uh...
I... I have to go now.
Huh?
But you said you had no work today.
I got a call.
But... You should stay over though.
But, wait a minute...
Huh?
Attention.
The local service train is arriving at platform one.
For your safety, please stand behind the yellow line.
So, you were chosen too, I see.
Since you're new at this
you can just watch what we do first.
Kobayashi did that too.
I will decide how to use your new lives.
Sorry if I startled you.
I have some questions.
If you don't mind.
You suddenly announced
an indefinite leave from work.
There are rumors you're sick
engaged, pregnant... maybe leaving.
But I've come to hear the truth,
from you.
Are you with the press?
It all fell into place as I was
investigating some mysterious incidents.
People who died in an accident
suddenly go missing from the scene
and the next day,
turn up as if nothing happened.
But on those nights
there are reports of unexplainable destruction
elsewhere in Tokyo.
Sound familiar?
No.
So then...
how about the rumor?
The black orb...
and the mysterious
apartment that it's in.
You know something don't you?
Okay that's four.
So you can ask me four questions.
What's your objective?
What exactly are you looking for?
A black ball this big.
A black ball?
With it I can find the roach's nest.
You mean the room with the black orb?
How do you know?
Who told you that?
I'll ask the questions.
So where is that room?
It's not in this dimension.
What do you mean?
You can't just walk over there.
Who are you people?
Sorry, that's the 5th question.
Why are you following these cases?
- The 6th.
- What do you want?
If you want to know...
then check out one more guy for me.
Just once,
why don't you go somewhere?
With Kei.
Focus, please.
But aren't
you two dating already?
No, we're not.
Why not?
You told him how you feel...
Until your brother comes back...
Kei can't really think about anything else I guess.
But it's okay.
When things settle down
I'll tell him about how I feel again.
Really?
Really.
Now continue.
Kurono
Total: 94 points. Only six more to go.
94, you're almost there.
Yeah.
Let go! What is this place?
Where the hell am I?
- We'll explain.
- Please, Calm down.
Uhhh... Who are you people anyway?
Who're we? Well...
I was a salaryman.
Worked in the stationery business for 20 years
and never took a day off.
But suddenly I was laid off.
I'm a caregiver for the elderly.
That's her day job.
At night, she's a bar hostess.
She's pretty popular for an old girl.
Can you believe it?
He's a parasite.
He lives off me.
I'm a part-timer.
I work at a curry shop.
It's a chain restaurant
but it's pretty good.
I'm a system engineer
at a company called OrientNet.
Please let me know if I can be of service.
And you?
What are you?
I'm a hairstylist.
Hey, Kei
are you really just a normal college student?
You fight...
you fight like you're an expert at this.
She's right about that.
Hey...
Why are you so strong?
There's somebody I want to resurrect.
Gantz.
He used to be part of our team.
We fought together.
Kei wants to bring him back to life using points.
But, he isn't the only one.
I want to bring back everyone who died fighting.
I want all of us to be set free
and live normally again.

Did you make it on time the other day?
Huh?
For what?
For work.
Work?
Oh! Yeah, I made it.
Well I'm glad you did.
Yeah. This old guy Suzuki called in sick
at the last minute...
and without him they needed more help
so I was called in.
What's wrong?
Kei,
did something good happen?
I can sense it.
Can you tell?
Tell me, what is it?
It's supposed to be a surprise
and I'm going to tell Ayumu too
but Kato is coming back soon.
You've been in touch with him?
Well, Kato asked me not to tell anyone.
So just, keep it secret.
I see.
But more importantly
I also wanted to inform you that...
uh, inform isn't the word I guess
How about a date?
Ok?
Let's go to the theme park.
If this is because I told you I liked you
I just...
I just got carried away.
So forget about it.
How can I forget that?
Hey. We should definitely go.
No, I can't.
No, I can't there's no way.
First of all, I'm afraid of heights
So Ferris wheels and
roller coasters are out of the...
Come on.
You were drawing a theme park in your sketchpad.
Besides seeing the real thing will be good
research for your comic.
Ok.
On one condition...
What is it?
I want you to call me by my first name.
Huh?
Starting now.
Please Kei?
But, uh...
Timing is difficult,
so lets start at our next meeting okay?
At the theme park,
for sure.
Okay.
That's a promise.
See ya.
Long time no see.
Old friend.
How did you get resurrected?
How did Gantz bring you back?
Don't you remember anything?
How many of you are left?
Uh, there are...
eight including me.
Three new people just joined us.
Gantz...
Must be stopped.
How Kato?
Do you know anything
about a black ball this size?
No.
I'll be back.
If you find out anything, please let me know.
Gantz
show me who's dead.
- What's wrong Kei?
- Kato came back to life.
What?
But how?
I don't know.
Wait, see he's still here.
What is this supposed to mean?
Kato
Yes...?
Brother.
You know...
I go to college with your friend Kei.
I'm Tae Kojima.
Ayumu, come over here.
Ayumu?
You didn't say anything and just left.
Where have you been?
He was... working, right?
I'm asking my brother, not you.
It was work.
Oh really?
That's right.
Ok, I see...
Do you want me to go?
You must have catching up to do.
I'm leaving.
I'm glad he's back, Ayumu.
Welcome Home Brother
I learned to bake while you were gone.
Go ahead.
I baked it in case you came home.
This is Kojima.
I mean, Tae, this is Tae.
Ayumu's brother just came home today. And so...
I had an idea...
Why don't we all go to the theme park?
But, then I guess it wouldn't be a date anymore.
I want to see you.
Would it be ok if I visit you at work?

Go now. Please, let us begin.
Where are we?
It's a train
This feels kinda weird.
Hey,

Have we met before?
A long time ago?
It's moving.
It's the subway.
- Huh?
- A subway car?
Everybody please stay alert.
The train will be departing in a moment.
Please refrain from boarding as the doors close.
Huh?
Why are there people here?
It's never been like this before.
Right?
There are roaches in the first car.
It's Eriko Ayukawa.
Wow, a star on the train.
Everyone, we are not here with any bad intentions.
We will not harm any of you.
Is this some kind of event?
Kei! Move!
Don't shoot!
The passengers will get hurt.
Did you hear screams?
And popping sounds.
What the... What's going on?
This isn't good.
Takahashi!
You guys are incredible.
Like naturals!
I was right.
I remember...
I remember this.
I remember now.
I know I've done this before.
Huh?
I was in that room before.
With Nakamura and Kobayashi too.
What?
Freeze!
Kei Kurono...
Kei?
Get out of here.
Wait...
Sorry.
No way!
You're heavy,
get off me.
I will protect you.
This one's really tough huh!
This is revenge.
This is revenge.
It was you people.
You started this.
You have killed so many of my friends.
We will never forgive you.
