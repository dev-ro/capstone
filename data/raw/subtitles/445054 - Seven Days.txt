Did you save your patient,
Daddy?
Of course.
You know I'm the best.
Sure.
And me?
You're the best
at being naughty.
Something else.
Something else?
Hold on...
You're the best little girl
in the world.
Give me your hand.
I'll deliver my invitations
after lunch.
Your party's in two weeks.
Come with me.
Princess, I'm beat.
Ask Mom.
She'll help you.
No, I want to go with you.
Daddy's tired, Jasmine.
After school, okay?
No, I'll just do it by myself.
I didn't get my dessert.
My dessert.
Thank you.
There.
If no one's home, leave
the invitations in the mailbox.
I know, Daddy.
I love you.
I'm beat.
I need sleep.
Unplug the phone on your way.
I'm only going in 15 minutes.
We have time.
Sylvie, I'm exhausted.
You can just lie there.
I'll take it from there.
Hi.
I brought Jasmine her homework.
What do you mean?
She wasn't at school
this afternoon.
Is she sick?
No.
- You didn't see her?
- No.
Thanks.
Jasmine?
Why didn't they call?
They left a message
asking why she wasn't in school
after lunch.
Didn't you answer?
I was asleep.
You know.
When did you wake up?
Around 2:30.
And you only listened to it now?
Do you normally drive her
to school?
No, she usually goes on her own.
Does she walk with anyone,
a friend?
- Not today.
- Not today.
How was she?
What was she wearing?
She was wearing a plaid skirt
and gray tights with boots.
Brown boots with...
She was carrying invitations.
Did she have a hat
or a schoolbag?
- A white coat with fur.
- She had a braid.
Thank you.
Should we follow her route
to school?
Sure.
We could go to the park,
ask her friends.
We can go right now.
Yes.
In case she calls.
We'll find her.
We'll find her.
She's always with Benoit,
who lives there.
- We'll find her.
- Or in the field in back.
You go here, I'll go there.
She never does this.
She usually calls or...
Does she know people there?
She has friends.
She's always with them.
We'll look over there.
Jasmine?
Roger.
Yes?
Dr. Hamel, stay here!
Dr. Hamel!
Dr. Hamel, stop!
Don't go there, Dr. Hamel.
Don't go there.
Don't go there.
"7 DAYS"
Dr. Hamel?
Detective Sergeant Mercure
speaking.
Sorry to bother you
at this difficult time.
We think we've found
your little girl's murderer.
Murderer?
We have solid
material evidence.
Plus we analyzed the DNA
of the sperm we found.
It matches the suspect's DNA.
In my opinion, the trial
will be a formality.
Hello?
Dr. Hamel?
Step aside, please!
Step aside.
Do you have anything to say?
A new twist in the case
of 8-year-old Jasmine Hamel
found raped and murdered
four days ago.
Already the police have found
enough evidence
to arrest a prime suspect.
He is a 31 -year-old laborer
named Anthony Lemaire,
who moved to Drummondville
a few months ago.
He'd previously lived
in St. Hyacinthe,
where he was charged
for sexual assault.
He was released
for lack of evidence.
But now,
in the case of Jasmine Hamel,
the evidence seems
more conclusive.
How long will he get?
About 15 to 25 years.
25 years.
Where are you going?
The hospital.
Work will do me good.
So soon?
Maybe you should go back
to the gallery.
It'll help you forget.
I don't want to forget!
See you tonight.
This isn't for
a friendly game of poker.
Not asking questions
and keeping your trap shut
is part of the contract.
It sounds kind of suspicious.
This is a small town here,
Mister...
I told you,
it won't happen here.
How long can I think it over?
20 seconds.
There are other towns,
other handymen.
$25,000.
$20,000.
How are you spending your days?
You know, I'm at the hospital.
That's not true.
I called.
I even left messages
on your cell.
That's right.
You never listen to messages.
What I'm asking is simple.
For two minutes' work
you pocket $10,000.
Think fast.
$5,000 now, $5,000 after.
$20,000, as agreed.
Plus $10,000 a day
if you don't talk.
What?
Every day I'll call to say
where the money is for a week.
Unless you talk.
If you talk, I'll know.
$10,000 a day?
You can be sure I won't talk.
We won't meet again.
"DAY ONE"
Dan, are you all right?
Wake up! Wake up!
Open your eyes, come on!
- What is it?
- Can I help?
I'm a doctor.
He blacked out.
I don't know what's wrong.
Get him out.
He needs air.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
He just fainted.
Hold him up.
I'll get my bag.
Dan, talk to me!
Open your eyes!
What are we doing here?
Where are we, fuck?
The driver is being questioned.
We located the van.
Your husband drugged him.
The driver lost consciousness.
We don't know
how he pulled it off.
What's he trying to do?
We expect to find Lemaire's
corpse within a few hours.
No, impossible.
That's not like Bruno.
So you don't know anything?
No.
You said your husband
has been out a lot.
I thought he was going...
That he...
That he what?
I don't know.
Do you always know
where your wife is?
My wife is dead.
You don't know
where he might be hiding?
A hotel, a country place,
a cottage?
No.
We wanted to buy something,
but we never got very far.
I want you to write down
everyone you know.
Relatives, friends, everyone.
We'll question his colleagues
at the hospital.
You understand,
we have to tap your phone.
Shit!
What's going on?
Why am I tied up like this?
What is this?
You bastard!
What do you want?
What's going on?
What do you want?
Who are you, damn it?
It wasn't me, man!
I swear, it wasn't me.
Wait till my trial, you'll see.
It wasn't me.
Man, look me in the eyes!
It wasn't me, fuck!
I've never seen your daughter.
I didn't do anything!
Untie me, we can talk.
I'll help you.
I'll help you, man.
I'll help you find
the real killer.
I hate pedophiles too,
just like you!
I hate the bastards!
What are you doing?
What are you gonna do?
Stop fucking around.
Stop joking!
Fuck!
I can't last like this!
You can't do this.
Jesus Christ!
You're sick, fuck.
Shit!
Don't leave me like this.
Fuck you, you sick bastard!
Sick piece of shit!
The security cameras
caught this
right after Lemaire
entered the courthouse.
"DAY TWO"
Have you found out who it is?
We're working on it.
Go to hell!
It wasn't me, shit!
It wasn't me, shit!
Goddammit!
You're committing
a major injustice, man.
It's you who'll go to jail,
you asshole.
A stunning development
in the Jasmine Hamel case.
Her father, Bruno Hamel,
is believed
to have kidnapped
the prime suspect.
We have no other details
for now.
If I were Hamel,
I'd cut off his balls.
And make sure he was conscious
while I did.
Hello?
Yesterday I wrecked his knee.
That's just the beginning.
It's your turn.
Tell me what to do next.
I want you to stop
and come home.
I was hoping you'd understand.
No one approves
of what you're doing.
Your family, your friends.
I don't care.
Fuck 'em.
It's for Jasmine.
I owe it to her.
You also think I owe it to her.
I didn't say that.
You also think I owe her a debt.
You have to come home, Bruno.
We'll help each other.
I hoped you'd see.
This is
Detective Sergeant Mercure,
Dr. Hamel.
If you turn yourself in now,
the mitigating circumstances...
I'll turn myself in.
Next Friday,
my daughter's birthday.
I'm going to kill him.
I'll turn myself in after.
We'll find you before.
I don't think so.
You're not a violent man,
Dr. Hamel.
Not fundamentally.
I know it.
What else do you know?
What you're feeling.
I'd be surprised.
My wife was shot six months ago
in a grocery
by a young thief
for 58 bucks.
Didn't you want to kill him?
Yes.
But I knew it was pointless.
Where is he?
In prison, where he belongs.
And that satisfies you?
At night,
lying in your big empty bed,
does it console you to know
your wife's killer is in jail?
Does it make your life
more bearable?
Bye, Sylvie.
The trace failed.
Wait till I get out of here!
Wait till I get out of here,
asshole!
"DAY THREE"
Pleau, it's Mercure.
My ring rolled under the door.
Can you get it?
Why don't you do it?
Without my ring, Pleau,
I can't face it.
I put the board back
like it was.
Thanks.
Hervé, you should...
A Drummondville electronics
salesman recognized Hamel.
The doctor bought $4,000 worth
of stuff, including a laptop.
A laptop?
I didn't know why
he wanted to get in, I swear.
It only took a minute.
He went in, came out...
I saw Bruno once
at the hospital.
I didn't expect him
to come to work so soon.
Hamel paid me
to crack the van door.
There's not a lock
I can't open.
Surgical instruments,
antibiotics,
even an artificial respirator.
They all went missing
last week.
After he paid me,
he sat in the parking lot...
He's such a calm man,
so gentle.
I must say,
I find it hard to believe.
You're not gonna charge me.
I learned my lesson.
Besides, I was cool.
I told you everything I know.
It's your turn to be cool.
Seriously,
I have to get to school.
The food's so I last longer?
I'm telling the truth.
Leave me alone.
Want me to confess,
is that it?
I did it.
I did it, man!
I confess.
But I'm sorry!
Shit, I'm so sorry.
So sorry!
I don't know why I did it.
I'm sorry, man!
I'm sorry.
I confessed, shit.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I'll say it again to the judge.
I'll be behind bars for years,
you can be sure.
I confessed, shit!
Stop! Stop!
I'll go to jail for life.
What more do you want?
I'll do anything you want!
Anything!
All right,
to summarize,
Hamel wants to torture the guy
undisturbed.
Where does he go?
A cottage?
He doesn't have one.
A motel room?
We'll keep searching,
but in a radius
of 100 kilometers,
there's a shitload of 'em.
A motel's not the place
to torture a guy,
too many people around.
So back to a cottage.
Did he break into
a friend's place?
We checked all the cottages
of his colleagues,
friends, relatives.
All right.
Maybe he rented one?
That's risky too.
Even if he paid cash,
the owner might remember him.
That leaves the abandoned cabin
in the woods.
Did he find it by accident?
Did he have it built?
In the woods...
Where?
Christ, we got nothing!
Does it really matter?
After all,
Lemaire's a child rapist.
Why should we bust our ass
to save a guy
who murders little girls?
It's not Lemaire
I want to save.
"DAY FOUR"
There's no point torturing me.
It won't bring back
your little girl.
After you finish me off,
what'll you do?
Only three days left
till the deadline runs out,
and still no sign
of Bruno Hamel.
How is the doctor's wife,
Mrs. Sylvie Bérubé,
coping with
this difficult situation?
Jean Fafard spoke with her.
It's hard.
I have nothing to say.
You don't approve
of his actions?
I think...
I think that his grief
has driven him mad.
I'm sorry.
Mrs. Bérubé?
In the Middle East...
What made you tell the press
I've gone crazy?
I'm not crazy;
I've never been so lucid.
Come back.
Stop all this.
How can you ask that?
How can you
ask that?
If you loved Jasmine,
you'd know this is for her.
You're doing it out of guilt.
You finally said it.
You think it's my fault, right?
- It's you who...
- Who what?
You could've gone with her.
But you wanted to fuck!
While you were having
your orgasm,
your little girl
was being raped.
If you'd answered the phone
or listened to the message,
maybe...
Maybe!
Screw your maybes!
Should we just hide in a corner
and cry?
I'm doing something, Sylvie!
They're really going at it.
He was calling
from St. Julie.
Trace the call.
He's losing it.
Anyone would lose it
if a loved one was murdered.
Fine, but we have to
capitalize on it.
Concentrate on cottage rental
agencies around St. Julie.
Search every home
recently occupied, one by one.
All my life
has been marked by violence.
And more of it
isn't going to help me.
When I was a kid,
I was abused and beaten.
I know what it is to suffer.
I need help, man!
Help, not more violence!
What's that?
What is it?
Curare?
It's to...
"CURARE: PARALYZES THE MOTOR
SYSTEM BUT NOT CONSClOUSNESS."
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
I can't take it.
You're worse than me.
You're worse than me!
"DAY FlVE"
I figured out what you did.
Fuck your food!
I'm not gonna shit out
my stomach again.
So?
What do you got planned now?
How you gonna amuse yourself?
Go on,
I can't wait to see.
Worst thing is, you don't even
seem to be enjoying yourself.
Finished already?
Running low on motivation?
I'll help you, okay?
Your daughter
wasn't the only one.
Those little sluts...
I killed three others too.
Marion Houle,
Laurie Thibodeau,
and Charlotte Masson.
I fucked 'em,
and then I killed 'em,
all three.
But your little girl,
Jasmine...
She was the best.
She was the prettiest.
Real pretty.
Fucking tease!
The way she was dressed.
She deserved to get her
cunt reamed.
While I was fucking her,
she kept calling you.
She said,
"Daddy! Daddy!"
Where were you?
Where were you?
Kill me.
Kill me!
Hervé?
It's Hamel on two.
He wants to talk to you.
Yes, Dr. Hamel?
You didn't answer last time.
What was the question?
The fact that your wife's
murderer is in prison,
does that make life
more bearable?
No.
Too bad we didn't talk before.
It's too bad, yeah.
I don't know why I called.
I shouldn't have.
That's not true.
You know why.
I can help you.
You can't even help yourself.
You're drowning, Dr. Hamel.
And you're starting
to realize it.
Yeah.
Let me sink.
The trace worked.
We'll be there in two minutes.
Bolduc and his men
are already in the area.
How precise is it?
Within 50 meters.
They only need to search
a few houses.
Montréal.
No.
We've got the address.
Bolduc's on his way.
Marion Houle.
Charlotte Masson.
Laurie Thibodeau.
Yes.
Yes, Bruno Hamel.
Check the names, you'll see.
Police!
Nobody here.
A remote-controlled computer?
What do you mean?
Where's he calling from?
We're identifying his lSP.
We'll call them.
It shouldn't take long.
Yes.
It's up north in Charette.
He subscribed
using a fake name.
Get the local guys in there.
We're at the address.
There's a laptop
and a cell phone, but no Hamel.
He's hiding somewhere else.
Hello.
With the gas?
$46.19.
I know who you are.
I'm with you.
Thanks.
You've been looking
near Charette.
Because that's
where he's hiding.
He called from there,
but he may not be there.
"DAY SlX"
He has to be.
He called his wife 15 minutes
after seeing her on TV.
In 15 minutes on a dirt road,
you can't drive
more than 25 kilometers.
Okay.
But it's still a huge area.
There are tons of cottages.
We'll put all our men on it.
We traced all Hamel's calls
to the Charette place.
He called TVA TV
just before we got there.
Who did he speak to?
We never thought they'd find
our little Laurie's killer.
Knowing that Bruno Hamel
has him prisoner,
we not only approve,
we urge him on.
I want you to make him suffer,
Dr. Hamel.
Make him suffer as much
as he made my Marion suffer.
One person disagrees,
the third victim's mother,
Mrs. Diane Masson,
a widow who raised her Charlotte
alone in St. Hyacinthe
until Anthony Lemaire
ruined her life.
I think what Dr. Hamel is doing
is pointless.
It won't help him, or me,
or anyone.
For me,
that man doesn't exist.
That horrible event happened
four years ago.
I went on with my life.
I'm all alone,
but I'm alive all the same.
St. Hyacinthe.
Yes.
Diane Masson.
What you said on TV
is disgusting.
Why did you bring me here?
For you,
that man doesn't exist?
We'll see about that.
I don't want to see him!
I don't want to.
I don't want to!
Let me go!
Let me go.
I said let me go!
You bastard!
I don't want to go!
I don't want to see him!
Look at him.
Look at him!
That man doesn't exist?
He doesn't exist?
Look at him.
He doesn't exist?
Go on.
Go ahead.
I know you want to.
Finish him off.
Come on.
Now's the time.
Do it, finish him off!
- Kill him.
- I won't.
- Kill the bastard.
- I won't.
- Kill the fucker!
- No!
Finish him off!
I'll give you time
to realize he exists.
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
I won't do it, I told you!
Please.
Please, let me out!
Let me out, please.
Please, let me out.
Please.
Let me go.
I'd erased that man
from my life.
- You can't.
- Yes, you can.
It's hard, it takes long,
but you can.
By bringing me here,
you destroyed that.
It's like...
It's like you killed my girl
a second time.
Every time
you torture that man,
you kill your own daughter.
Take me to the police.
Concentrate on waterfront houses
by a lake or river.
Forget rental cottages.
Masson's convinced Hamel
broke into a private home.
He's using Masson's car,
a red Saturn.
We have the license plate.
"DAY SEVEN"
I'll go there.
It's an hour away.
I want to be in Charette
when they find him.
Keep me posted.
Call Mercure.
We found him.
Dr. Mercure?
Sergeant Coutu.
We just called the SWAT team.
We'll move in now.
Yeah.
- I don't want...
- He won't just wait for us.
There's been no movement?
Nothing.
Maybe he's still asleep.
Call an ambulance.
Tell them no siren.
Is this Hamel's hideout?
You found him?
Is Lemaire dead?
No comment yet.
Please step back.
Keep those guys far away.
And make sure they keep
their mouths shut.
Here we go.
Is he trapped?
He's trapped.
It's her birthday today.
She would have been 9.
Bruno Hamel?
This is Detective Sergeant
Hervé Mercure.
You're surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
Bruno Hamel!
Come out with your hands up.
Drop your gun.
Dr. Bruno Hamel,
you are under arrest for
kidnapping and attempted murder.
You have a right
to immediate legal counsel.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say
can be used against you.
I didn't kill him.
Dr. Hamel?
Do you still think vengeance
is the right answer?
No.
So you regret
what you've done?
No.
