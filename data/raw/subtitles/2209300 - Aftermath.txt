Burek!
Go away, Yids!
Burek,
you no good mutt...
Come here!
Need some help?
I'll manage. You take Burek
and bury him in the garden.
They shoot him?
This ain't America.
Cut his head off with the scythe.
I'll hold it in place,
you screw them on.
I was at the registry
and stopped by the archives.
A little more to the right...
What for?
There was something
wrong with the papers.
Little higher, otherwise
the screw won't hold...
This is our land, our father's,
our grandfather's, our...
Our father's, yes. But Grandpa's farm
was originally down by the river-bend.
It's all marshland down there. No wonder
he took this land during the reform.
And where do you think they got
the land they gave Father from?
It was the landlord's.
You know, Koscieliski's,
the one who fled to America, like you.
The Koscieliski estate only went up
to that side of the woods.
The woods were theirs,
but this here land wasn't.
Talk straight, will you.
All these were Jewish farms.
From the woods down to the river.
After the Germans killed the Jews
our people took their homes and land.
All the reform did was round it off
so everyone would have 5 hectares.
- How many of them were there?
- Yids? - Jews.
Twenty six families.
Over a hundred people. Get it?
Folks are scared of them coming
back and claiming what's theirs.
In the old days they would've
set dogs on them, but now...
the law's on their side,
and there's documents
in the archives to prove it.
Those Jews were all smallholders.
The reform wouldn't have touched
their land. The law's on their side.
If this was Chicago
we'd all be sued by now.
- Are you sure?
- Swear to God.
It's all Jewish property,
all we can hope to get from the county
is that marshland Father moved out of.
Lucky this isn't America and the Yids...
the Jews don't run things,
otherwise it would
have been done long ago...
- No one claimed it all this time.
- That's what I'm saying.
Under communism nobody would have dared.
Now they might not know
their families lived here.
So now you know why folks
don't look kindly on you.
OK.
- We'll manage.
- Sure, why shouldn't we?
Work's harder than
you're used to in America.
Harder? Not harder,
it's no picnic in America either.
Although here you're working
for yourself, and not some ass.
Huh?
I dunno.
Makes it all seem worthwhile...
What?
Nothing. Jozek, let's go by
that river-bend later, huh?
Maybe our old house is still there?
- We're too close to the river.
- No we're not.
Durign the flood,
the water reached up to there.
The bed's normally
twenty meters narrower.
Jozek, anybody here still
remember the occupation?
Nobody I think.
Some historian in Lomza maybe?
- Suds - how old is he?
- Eighty or thereabouts.
Means he was a teenager during the war.
Anybody older?
They all passed away.
Then there's old Palka,
must be a hundred by now,
but you won't get any sense out of her.
Stone-deaf and senile.
There's also Malinowski,
he's way past eighty,
but they don't speak to no one.
- Malinowski?
- The old man, his son and grandson.
Edek's wife, the kid's
mother, lives with them,
but I never saw them speaking
to one another either.
- Strange, huh?
- You get all sorts.
No one says you have to talk to people.
What about the old madwoman?
That one who we were scared of?
Come on.
She was probably locked in a mental
hospital during Gomulka's governing.
She died there most likely.
People in America keep saying that
Poles denounced Jews to the Germans -
Jews in particular.
No wonder, too.
Poles won't say things like that.
Here it is.
Jeeez... you think
that's our old cottage?
Nothing else around.
Pretty small...
Way smaller...
Let's go. Gotta get up
at 3:30 a.m. Tomorrow.
Fire! Jozek, it's burning!
Look!
Over here!
You fuckers.
Come on, we'll go get them...
We won't make it by ourselves.
Tell the men to mow it down
along the road double quick,
or else it'll all go up in smoke.
Fellas, grab your scythes and
clear it as far in as you can.
Dig!
Why're you here and not
at our place? The fire's there.
Get out of my face.
Talk to the captain.
What are you doing here?
It's our field that's burning!
It's too late to save yours.
We're making a line to
stop the fire spreading.
What do you mean too late?
There's a fire, you put it out.
Let us have two engines.
Or one, at least.
Don't tell me how to do my job.
Send your men to my field
right now, motherfucker.
Hands off, shithead.
Kalina calm down,
or I'll have you arrested.
Tell them to go to my field
before I fucking kill you.
That's it, give them
Jews what they deserve.
Out.
I spoke to the police chief.
In view of what happened to you last
night, the disaster that befell you...
and of your condition...
well, he's willing to forget
about the whole thing.
He might be willing but I'm not.
Now you see, Father, what bastards,
begging the Father's pardon, they are.
- Goral, lock 'em up.
- Sooner or later, you son-of-a-bitch...
- Shut up. - What?
- Shut up.
- Says who?
- Says me. Your older brother.
Thanks for bailing us out, Father.
- It was arson.
- You can't prove that.
In '44 they seized the farms
of all the Jews who got killed,
and now they're afraid
they'll lose them.
It's easy to cast blame on others.
Not others.
Our father took Wiemelman's
farm after they murdered him.
When did all this happen?
I never heard the story before,
and I read up on the history of
the parish before I took it over.
There have to be some traces.
The Germans executed 26 Jewish
families, over a hundred people in all.
Much smaller Nazi war crimes
were investigated.
They wouldn't have overlooked this.
And since witnesses are still around...
- Malinowski and what's her name...
- Old Palka.
Right, and Sudecki
has to remember something,
even though he was still a kid.
Mrs. Palka...
Mrs. Palka is a patient
in our ward. God bless.
- The Father asked me to fix you up.
- We'll be fine.
If you've got a problem
with my grandfather,
I suggest you take it up with him
and leave me out of it, alright?
Unless you want to die of tetanus?
- What's wrong with old Palka?
- Old age...
Good morning Mrs. Palka,
my name is Franek Kalina,
Stanislaw's son, remember me?
Whose son?
Stanislaw Kalina's,
lived by the woods.
He's dead, that one.
I'm his son, Stanislaw Kalina's son.
Edek...
Edek drowned, he was my older brother.
I'm the middle one, Franek.
I don't recall, it's been so
long, I don't recall.
Mrs. Palka, remember
who stole your rabbits?
Two bucks, your husband kept them.
Rabbits?
Sure, was the Kalina boy stole them,
- but they never fessed up.
- I was the one who stole them.
- I didn't want them to be killed.
- How's that?
I'm Kalina's boy, the one
who stole your rabbits.
- You're Franus?
- That's me.
Mrs. Palka, do you remember the Jews?
Sure I remember.
Pretty boys they were:
Abram, he was a pretty one,
such black eyes he had,
all us girls were sweet on him.
But he only had eyes for that Helka.
Way back when that was, they're
gone now, what's the use of talking?
Mrs. Palka, what happened to them?
- Abram?
- Abram and the others.
The usual thing...
Germans came and
then the Yids were gone.
What year was it, do you remember?
At the beginning of the war,
end of the war?
Weren't no end of the war.
Soon as the Germans came
they registered all the Yids
- and the same week they were gone.
- Did they deport them or something?
- To Lomza? To Bialystok?
- Who knows what they did.
They was here one day and gone
the next, every single one.
The Perlman boy hid
in the village awhiles,
but wasn't a week 'fore
the Germans took him, too.
- Whose place did he hide at?
- I don't know nothing 'bout that.
Did he hide at your place?
Heavens no,
mister, not on your life.
People talk, you don't even
know how mean people are.
They'll say anything
s'long as it suits them.
Saying I sold moonshine and all,
well, mebbe I did, and mebbe
I didn't, they can't prove it,
but I never sold no Jews out.
Not like the others.
Did you find out
anything from Mrs. Palka?
I'm not sure,
I'd need to talk to your grandfather.
Grandpa was a teenager
when the war started,
- he was just a child...
- Will you take me to him?
- What do you need this for?
- What? - All this...
As if I knew.
My brother got me into it,
and then it sort of happened.
I don't know why...
The more they don't
let you do something,
the more they want to hide something,
the more you want to know.
- It's the best reason I can give you.
- Contrariness.
No. The truth. Only truth.
And justice for all.
Stop here.
What are you looking for?
The tannery...
They kept them here.
But not the Jews.
Grandpa, mister Kalina
wanted to talk to you.
Mister Sudecki, do you remember
how the Germans took the Jews
from the village during the war?
Sure I remember.
Why d'you want to know, now?
Weren't your people, were they?
But I got their farm now,
and I want to know since when.
Don't be asking me.
I mind my own business,
don't care about other folks'.
So there...
Mister Sudecki.
Since when have you been
living in this house?
A long time now.
But you weren't born here, were you?
I's born across the river,
like your daddy was.
When did the Germans take
the Jews out of the village?
What?
- When did the Germans take the Jews?
- How do you know, they were taken?
- Maybe you know then where?
- I don't, but I will.
You won't know anything,
if it didn't happen at all.
- What do you mean?
- Don't be asking me,
better ask around your house...
- Whaddya want with Gramps?
- Get your ass outta here, right now.
- What's with the two of you?
- Get her in the house.
- Let me go. Hands off, that hurts.
- Shut up or I'll smack you one. Ma!
Don't appreciate no strangers
sneaking round this here farm.
I'm just having a talk,
your grandfather doesn't mind that.
Justyna invited me.
Gramps is old an' all,
maybe he don't want to talk,
an' I got a right to know
who's talking to him an' why.
An' stay away from my sister
or you won't be seeing America again.
- I spoke to Palka.
- And?
She said the Germans took the Jews
in the Summer of 1941,
but that still doesn't explain
why no one knows about it.
Maybe they do, only we don't.
The priest said he studied
the history of the region
and didn't find any mention
of deportations.
Go on.
I spoke with old Suds,
Sudecki that is,
- and he said something odd.
- Namely?
That I should ask around our house.
But he didn't say whom.
He can't have meant you?
Maybe he didn't mean
anything particular?
Maybe this was about
the house generally.
So I told you, that I would have found
some documents during the renovation.
Even the floor was changed in '80...
He didn't mean documents,
but the house.
You are really stubborn.
I renovated my house.
But your house isn't ours
father's. It is by the river.
There is nothing there,
you saw it.
Let's go there once more.
Maybe the house
will tell us something
- what people are afraid of to think.
- Franek, come on.
What can the house tell us?
That the Germans never deported
the Jews from our village.
Meaning what?
Meaning that they're still here.
- Where do we dig?
- Anywhere inside.
Like my cigs, you son-of-a-bitch?
Go ahead and choke on them.
I had twenty packs in that bag.
You could at least
chuck one over here...
There's nothing here...
Hail Mary full of grace,
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women
and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour
of our death.
- Grace be to you...
- And peace from God.
Found them at last,
the poor souls.
Why don't you bury them
in that graveyard you made.
We'll bury them, mother.
You live in the woods?
God granting.
Did you see what happened here?
Everybody saw it.
They herded them into the Kalinas'
cottage then set fire to it.
Laughing, drinking vodka.
'That's for Jesus on the cross,'
they hollered,
and inside the young 'uns were crying,
all crying,
and then there was only
the silence and the dying.
The soldiers shouted it was
for Jesus? And drank vodka?
Weren't no soldiers here.
Mothers threw the wee'uns
outside to save them,
and they pitched them
back into the fire...
Lord have mercy.
They were only children.
You're saying there weren't
any soldiers, mother?
They could have worn
black uniforms,
not green but black with
skulls on the collars...
Listen to me, mother. You didn't
see any Germans in green uniforms,
but they might have worn black...
Them with the skulls came by car
a day before then. Two of them.
They spoke to the Head,
Malinowski that is, and went
back where they came from...
Weren't no Germans hereabouts.
What do you mean
there were no Germans?
So who got them in the cottage
and set them on fire?
Everybody, the whole village.
Everybody?
What do you mean everybody?
Was Malinowski lit the fire himself,
- along with one other fellow...
- You saw it all, mother?
You Saw it? You were here
or you were told by the others?
Stood right there,
crying to let them go,
then the other one knocked me
on the head, made the blood run,
and says, if you feel sorry for them
you old bitch, you can join them inside,
and I was so scared.
I wanted to live.
As if them Jews didn't?
What do you want?
We dug up Jewish
bones in our old house.
- What business is that of mine?
- Folks say you burned them to death.
Folks say all sorts of things.
Damned if I care.
Where's your son?
Just me here.
As should you be - alone.
Just you and me.
Recognize my brother? From America.
Your brother I don't mind,
but it's none of my kids' business.
- So who burned them to death if not 
you?
- Ain't worth talking about.
No one said anything for 60 years,
and now they deserve a proper burial.
They might not be Christians,
but folks ain't cattle,
- they all got a right to a grave.
- You won't bring them back.
- The dead don't care where they rest.
- You're wrong.
Sons care where their
fathers are buried.
- Their sons are down there with them.
- So who burned them if it wasn't you?
Who? The Krauts.
Krauts did all sorts of things.
There weren't any Germans around then.
The previous day two
officers drove up in a car
and gave you the go-ahead
to kill the Jews. SS officers.
The next day you rounded them up
in our house and burned them.
I rounded up a 120 people all by myself?
Dream on, Kalinas, dream on...
The whole village helped you,
but you laid the fire yourself.
Dream on, Kalina, dream on...
Malinowski, how old are you?
Ninety?
- Your time might come tomorrow...
- Might today.
Tell it like you were confessing.
Did you start that fire?
You think I'm afraid of death?
One fears no death who
saw death as a regular thing.
Someone for whom killing a dog and
killing a neighbour is the same.
I didn't kill neighbours.
Don't tell if you don't know.
I didn't kill neighbours.
Neighbours not.
But the Yids. Tell the truth.
Tough man you are, Kalina!
You want the truth.
Do you know if you won't choke with it?
If it's a confession you're
wanting, then I'll tell you.
The fire was started on
two sides of the house.
And it was...
Your father Stanislaw
Kalina was on the other.
There's your confession...
Bury 'em back and let 'em lie there.
You're lying!
You're lying!
- Jozek!
- Truth hurts, don't it...
No... Jozek, don't!
- Die, you son-of-a-bitch...
- Who was there, bastard, you or me?
Your father hacked them Jews with a saw
and kicked Halszka Mintz's
head all over the road,
'cause she wouldn't put out
for him before the war.
He chased her, and then he grabbed her
hair, and smashed her head on the 
ground,
he grabbed her hair,
and smashed her head on the ground,
he grabbed her hair...
And she was crying: "mama, mama..."
and he smashed her head on the ground,
'till he sliced her neck clean open.
Is that what you want to tell people?
I'll swear to it as a witness.
Is that what you want, motherfucker?
So don't be raising
your hand against me.
Jozek!
So, what do you want to do now?
Nothing. What's there to do?
We'll bury them in the cemetery.
If we start moving the bones
it'll all come out.
The authorities will find out,
the papers will find out,
the whole country will
be talking about it.
The whole world will
start talking about it.
I know them Chicago Jews.
They won't let it go that easy.
In 20 generations they'll remember about
our village, Malinowski, and our father.
That's their right
and our hope, too. Maybe the likes
of our father won't be seen again,
God permitting.
We'll bury them where we found them.
Now, tonight.
- What?
- No one will know.
- But we know.
- And we'll take it to our graves.
- No.
- Yes.
No, Jozek.
This world is a lousy shithole.
And we won't make it one bit better,
but you know what?
We won't make it worse.
And that's something.
Our family's done way more
than its share of evil.
You ran away from all this 20 years ago.
Go back to America, and leave
the whole business to me.
- I'm your brother.
- You're not.
I renounced you when you left,
Father cursed you and nobody even
spoke your name all these years.
Mother cried her eyes out for you
in secret, scared to admit it.
My brother died in '80.
Get out of my house.
I'm your brother.
Brother!
I knew...
Lady, are you nuts?
What if I hadn't hit the brakes?
Jozek?
