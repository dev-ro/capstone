An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.
(M. K. Gandhi)
It's stuffy in here.
Natalie, where's the water?
What do you need?
Ah, I've found it.

- Thanks.
We'll have some coffee first.
- Evening.
- Evening. - Hi.

- Mario.
- Michael, hi. How's things?
- Fine.
- Good to see you.
- You've gotten older.
What can you do? In this job?
Stairs up, down, up, down...
Talking of work,
your last zero fuel weight was...
I'm sorry, my German isn't very good.
See you.
- Evening, madame. You're with the gentleman?
- Yes.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Welcome aboard.
Welcome, good evening.
- Is that it?
- I think so. - Okay, I'll do the final check.
Please put your rucksack
under the seat in front of you.
Would you put
your bag under the seat, please?
I think that's it.
Welcome aboard.
You're lucky we waited.
It's her fault.
Allahu akbar!
Everyone to the back!
Come on move! Everyone to the back!
Everyone to the back! Everyone to the back!
Everyone to the back!
Kinan! Kinan!
Yes, I'm fine.
I'm all right.
Everything's okay.
Open the fucking door, or I'll kill him!
Hello?
What have you done to Kinan?
He's American.
You're a fucking American?
He's not to land!
Tell him I'll kill him!
- You should leave him alone.
- Then he should open up!
Tell him he's got ten seconds.
Tell him I'll really do it.
He won't open the door!
Help me!
Ten...!
Nine...!
Eight...!
Seven...!
Six...!
Please help me! Help me!
Five...!
Four...!
Help me!
Three...!
We can land soon and negotiate with them.
No one's going to land here!
What are you doing?
No, no, no!
Daniel, no!
I'm not doing anything!
I'm not doing anything!
Please! I have a child, I have a child!
Daniel, he won't open the door!
Hello!
Please! I have a child. Please!
- Daniel, he'll kill Kinan.
- Tell him to go ahead!
Something else is waiting for us.
I'm not afraid to die!
Do you think you can threaten me?
Don't anyone dare to come closer!
I'll kill her!
I'll kill her! All of you stay where you are!
Why don't you understand?
Wanna try it? Go ahead!
Bring it on, all of you! I dare you, you cunts!
Please! I have a child, I have a son!
I have a child, a son. Please!
Please don't, please don't!
I'm a Muslim!
She's a Muslim. She's like us.
- She's not a Muslim!
- I am a Muslim!
Shut up! I've had enough!
Open the door!
Five!
- Four!
- Daniel, please!
Daniel, stop it! Daniel!
I've had enough of this bullshit!
I've had enough!
Open the door!
Three!
Two!
One!
He's going to open it.
He's going to open the door!
Let her go!
- He's shitting us.
- He isn't, he's going to open the door.
- That's enough! Shut up!
- No! Daniel!
Daniel? Daniel?
The passengers! The passengers!
Come on, open the fucking door!
Come on! Come on!
Where are you?
Come on! Vedat!
The door's open! The door's open!
Hurry! Close the door!
Hurry!
Help me up.
Come on, help me up!
Help me up!
Hurry!
Watch out!
Everything's okay!
- Calm down. Are you okay?
- There was so much blood...
- Calm down...
- He just stabbed her...
- Are you hurt?
- She screamed so loudly...
Are you all right?
Okay, listen to me!
- Listen to me!
- Daniel and Kalkan!
- There's no one else left but you and me, okay?
- Daniel and Kalkan! - Look at me!
Just the two of us!
I love you. We'll soon be done.
Everything will be okay. We don't need that.
What are you doing? What are you doing?
- I want to know what's happening to Daniel. Daniel and Kalkan!
- Okay...
Everything's okay.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Just kill him!
Go on.
Seven, six...
What are you doing? Huh?
Why don't you kill him? Stab him!
Stab him!
Hello? Is anyone there?
Can anyone hear me?
Yes, we can. Who are you?
I'm in control. Both your pilots
are dead, so you can give up all hope.
- What do you want?
- This isn't a hijacking!
This plane is about to crash. We're ready
to die and there's nothing you can do.
And I know very well
that your laws forbid you to shoot us down,
so listen carefully, okay?
Today, we're avenging the deaths
of our brothers and sisters.
Every day,
Muslims are slaughtered by you Westerners.
Now you're going to find out what it's like
when your children and families die.
Your damned egoism and rotten lies
cause new suffering every day, but...
But now it's our turn.
Now you're going to burn for your sins.
Allahu akbar.
Allahu akbar.
Okay, here we go. Don't be afraid.
- Okay, autopilot...
- European 162, can you hear me?
Tell me your demands.
Tell me your demands.
Tell us what we can do.
Now...
Come and sit over here!
Sit down here! I know you're afraid.
Don't be afraid,
Allah has brought us this far.
There's no turning back now.
We have to end this.
We've almost made it, there's the city.
Almost there...
Come and sit with me. Come on!
Kinan, is what we're doing right?
- Kinan, is this right?
- Yes, it is.
Believe me, it is right.
Allah knows what's right or wrong.
Sit with me.
Please tell us your demands.
Come and sit with me, brother.
Why are you frightened?
Please don't be afraid. Trust me: this is right.
Now come to me.
Trust me. There's no need to be afraid.
Just come here!
Almost there.
The whole world is watching us.
Look at that! Do you see it?
Come on!
Calm down, Vedat.
We're almost there. Come sit with me, my brother.
Come on!
Come and sit with me!
No!
I don't want to die!
- Kinan, I can't! I can't!
- Yes, you can.
I know you can, now come sit with me.
I can't! I can't!
I don't want to die! I don't want to die!
- Pray with me.
- I don't want to die.
I don't want to die! Kinan!
No!
Yalla, come on!
- I can't! I can't!
- Sit down.
- I can't!
- Come to me. You don't need to be afraid anymore.
No! I don't want to die, Kinan!
We're almost there.
- We're almost there!
- Kinan, I don't want to die.
No!
Welcome death, welcome it.
We're almost there.
- What are you doing?
- Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
European 162, are you receiving me?
European 162, are you receiving me?
European 162, can you hear me?
Are you receiving me?
Is anybody there?
Is there anyone in the cockpit
who understands me?
One, two, three.
Hello? Can you hear me?
My name is Alexander Franz.
I'm from the police.
I'd like to talk to you.
I'd like to help you to get out of this situation.
Please answer me.
If you answer me, I can help you.
Please go to the radio and answer me.
At least give me a sign
that you can hear me.
- Hello?
- Hello, thank you for answering me.
I'm Alexander Franz.
I'm from the police. I'd like to help you.
Tell me what I can do for you.
- I don't want anyone to come in here.
- I assure you, no one will try to get in.
I have a hostage.
So do what I say.
I want you to refuel this plane. Now!
I'd like to do that, but I need time.
I want to leave in 20 minutes.
I'm giving you 20 minutes!
I'll do everything I can,
but I'm going to be honest:
20 minutes isn't enough time...
No, 20 minutes! Where's the problem?
It takes time.
We have to order the tanker and fill it up.
Then we have to drive it out to you.
That takes time.
Please believe me.
Hello? Did you hear what I said?
You have to tell me what happens next.
- You've got half an hour.
- We need more time...
No, I won't give you more time!
I'll try, but I don't know
how we'll manage all that in 30 minutes.
- Hurry up!
- Talk to me about...
I don't want to talk!
I don't want to talk!
- I understand...
- I want you to refuel this plane!
- That's happening while we 're talking.
- Then hurry up! Hurry up!
Or I swear I'll kill him!
- 30 minutes!
- Calm down. I can only meet your demands if the pilot remains unharmed.
I really want to get you out of this situation.
But that will only happen
if you don't harm the pilot. Okay?
Did you hear what I said?
It's vital
that we continue talking to each other.
I'd like to understand what brought you here.
It wasn't your fault, was it?
I don't think
you wanted this to happen.
I can help you. Maybe...
A passenger plane
on its way from Berlin to Paris
is reported to have been hijacked
by Islamist terrorists.
After courageous passengers
overpowered some of the hijackers,
the plane made an emergency landing
in Hannover.
A police spokesman has confirmed
that one hijacker is still on board the plane,
which is why
there is a wide cordon around the airport.
Heavily armed special police units are taking up
position. The first curious onlookers have...
Hello, can you hear me?
This is Alexander Franz again.
I'm in the car
that's now approaching the plane.
I couldn't reach you by radio
and I want to carry on talking to you.
I want to find a way for you and Tobias
to come out of this unharmed.
I'm getting out of the car
and I'm going to stand below the plane.
Could you maybe open the window?
I'm standing below the plane.
Could you open the window?
Thank you for opening the window.
How are you now?
- Please come to the window.
- Have you refueled the plane?
- Could you speak a little louder...?
- Have you refueled the plane?
The tanker is full and ready to go.
But now you've got to do something for me.
Let me have a quick word with the pilot.
I want to see that he's okay.
Please bring Tobias to the window.
Where's my tanker?
Bring Tobias to the window first. Please.
- Refuel the plane first!
- But you have to make a tiny concession to me.
- Don't shit me!
- I'm really not shitting you!
Trust me. I really want to help you.
I want you and Tobias
to come out of this unharmed.
- Shut up!
- But you have to give me something. Please.
Bring Tobias to the window.
I need to see that he's okay,
that he doesn't need medical assistance.
Please!
Then I'll send you the tanker right away.
Thank you for doing that. That's good.
Here he is!
Where's my tanker?
I'm now going to give the sign
for the tanker to approach the plane.
Did you hear that?
The tanker is full and good to go.
Did you hear that?
Could you answer, please?
Please come back to the window
and talk to me.
Otherwise I'll have to stop the tanker.
Don't do anything stupid now!
You're worrying me.
Come back to the window.
Mom...
I trusted them.
What's wrong?
Why aren't you answering me?
I want to go home, Mom.
I want to go home.
I want to get out of here.
Please stop this!
Put the knife down,
open the door and come out. Please.
I know you didn't want any of this.
But you can make it stop now.
Be reasonable.
I'm sorry.
Just stop it and come out.
Put down the knife and come out.
Then it will be all over.
Hey, what are you doing?
Lower the knife immediately!
Lower the knife immediately.
Lower the knife!
Lower the knife immediately!
Well done! It's really good
that you're lowering the knife.
No! No! No!
No!
Where's my tanker?
Don't shit me! Don't shit me!
- Lower the knife! Don't hold it to his throat.
- Listen to me! - I am!
If I don't fly out of here
in two minutes, I'll kill him!
- I'll kill him!
- If you threaten him, I can't guarantee your safety!
- You're all shitting me!
- Really I'm not.
You must believe me. I want to help you,
but please lower the knife.
Boy, I'm sure you don't want anything
to happen to the pilot. Lower the knife.
Listen to me! Lower the knife!
Or I can't guarantee your safety!
Put the knife down immediately.
Come on, put the knife down, please.
Police, open the door!
Open the cockpit door!
We're going in! Police! Police!
Four persons, the pilot is still alive.
Go! Go!
The pilot's coming out!
Hijacker unconscious, bleeding heavily.
I'll bring him out.
Hijacker is coming out!
You got him?
I'm going back in.
I repeat: I'm going back into the cockpit.
Two further persons in the cockpit.
Presumably the captain.
He's lifeless.
One further male.
Also lifeless.
We're coming out now.
