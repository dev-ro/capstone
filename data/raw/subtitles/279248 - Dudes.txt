You do nothing around
the house...
In the savannah food chain
All I do is wash, iron, clean.
Good afternoon, Auntie ela.
Fuck you and your
"good afternoons"!
For the past tWo years.
You stinker!
Someone kicked your
ass again, eh?
What's that on your face?
Pop and Mare's plan for today:
A: rehearsal and meeting
With Goyko the Tit
about the studio.
B: Mare's mission is
to bang ola, 322-1 847.
and become a man. you pussy.
Did you fuck me?
Nope.
ook at these kids, just
like When I was a kid.
Doing the same things
for centuries:
the same Words, mess,
impudence, arrogance
and folly, folloWed by the
same adult Wisdom.
One day they'll groW old
in the same way,
With the same rottenness,
resignation, recklessness
and impetuosity as kids
from past generations.
I never liked kids or old people.
Some guy Eugene lonesco..
I forgot the key.
No sWeat. I got it.
Bitchin'.
HOW TOUGH ARE YOU?!?
HoW about Mettalica?
-Why?
I dig the part When

spits When he plays.
"And nothing else matters"!
ET'S SEE WHO'S TOUGH?!?
On three, four...
Three, four or three,
four, go?
Go!!!
THUNDERBIRDS

We're doing it.
There's a party tonight.
Big place, lots of young
inexperienced chicks.
I can tell We're gonna score!
Concentration, Mare,

Raya told me that there'd
be some college chicks.
It'll be like: 'et's swap notes.
What's your
average?' Get it?
They study real hard, and then.
Shit, man. I need some action!
Way to go, thunderbird!
Goyko the Tit, eh? I don't knoW.
He says 1 50 bucks is
enough for one session?
He's not thrilled,
but he'll do it for us.
Hell, We've knoWn
each other for years.
Chill out. It's all settled.
Just so there aren't any problems.
Problems? What problems?
I'm kidding, man.
What's up With you?
Chill out. We'll go there

I don't feel like doing this for you.
It sounds kind of angry to me.

Wait! et me finish!
I've decided not to help you after all.
This is a your chance to make.

They'll kill for it. Shit, it'll be like.
Check out this

Kids come here nonstop.
They're real stupid. and ugly.
Alright. Give me our
money and I'll split.
Want a little beer?
Go on, it's clean.
What money?
The 1 50 bucks We gave

I wanted to give it back.

The carousel, bumper cars.
But the punch bag didn't Work.
No spare parts, they said.
There's no place

Just 5 more minutes.
Your gig's not for 3 more hours.
Some tall guy just hit on me.
Cute butt.
He took my number.
I'll give him yours if you want.
That's fine, but I'm off.
You can stay, ok?
Just don't miss my first gig.

You'll get in, like never!
Shit!

Chill out. Somebody

Good evening.
Yes? Who is it? Who's there?
Silence! I'll kill you all!!!
I need to hear a joke
before I let you in.
Get lost!
Wait, man. We'll get in!
Right. Over 7 hills and 7 seas,
7 mountains and
7 valleys, 7 rivers,
7 lakes, 7 villages, 7
forests, in a glade in a
crumbling old house lived
a scary dragon. One
morning he opened the
door, looked out and said:
'Shit, What a place to live!!!'
HoW Will I recogniZe you?

Man, did you hear that?
Only female voices?!!!

322-1 837
.Iose pounds With ease.
Don't tell me you get off

Shit, I thought she was

Hell, no, she's into adverts.
You mean you've met?
Hey, the girls' room is over there.
Guitars, plectrums and stuff?

It's a joke! A joke!
Hi!
You're a funny guy!
Oh, really?
You knoW, since these sanctions,

Why not Write to the Security Council?
Really. I mean. do you

Ice cream, cinema,
Weed, a bit of groping.

He's forcing me to go to 'Bedrock'.
Great! My friend is

She's really hot.
Can you give me her
number, so she can give

No shit!!?
Mare!
What's the time?
-I've no idea.
Why? I thought We
could go to your place
for a quick grope,
While your folks are sleeping,
your dad snoring.
My dad's dead.
-Oh, sorry.
I'm kidding.
-Sorry.
Of all the chicks,
you had to chat up mine?
Think you're a big shot?
Where do you think you're going?
Hey, guys. What's all the tension?
You can sense danger in the air.
Where's that itch?
I'll scratch it for you?!
Right here.
Out of the way.
What do you want?
Get off him!
It looks like they're gatecrashers!
They've locked us out!
Give us the keys.

Are you nuts?
-What was I to do?
They Were beating up my buddy.

My friend and I Were

.When someone knocks on the door.
He's all flushed and looks straight at ola.
The boys' room is over there.
isten, We have a band, too.
Doesn't have a name yet,
but We've got some Wicked
stuff. Drum'n'bass,
yelling, you knoW, rage.
Maybe you could be.say, on the cover.
ook, I'm totally freaked.
Maybe it's stupid, but I told myself:
'Mare, my man, make a move. NoW!'
Who's taking you home?
Hey, Who's taking you home, sister?!
I didn't. Honest.
I figured it out.
Whenever you say
honest, you lie. Honest!
Hey! Come back!
-Bring back the key!
I knoW Where you live!
What a night!
-.for a break-up.
It was nice meeting you,
but We've got some business.
You'll see each other
around. Come on, Pop!
Hey, Wonkers! Give us the key back!
Hello.
Hi, honey!
I'm doWntoWn With some girlfriends.
Yeah, they're hot. Put ola on.
I'm on my way. See you. Bye.

Forget love and stuff.
We're not going to 'Bedrock'.
Come on. Guitars

really cute but you'll
have to go on your oWn.
Hello, Pop! We're
going to 'Bedrock', man.
ook, me and my
buddy have a band.
It doesn't have a name yet.
But We've got Wicked tunes.
Drum and bass. It's mad!
The oWner Will help us record.
The oWner?
-Yeah.
Goyko?
-Goyko the Tit.
Goyko is my boyfriend.
You're going out With the Tit?
This is so confusing.
Wait on. You'll have to come With us!
Man, We've got our album!
You're my best friend!
What's all this? Candid camera?
HoW can you be With Goyko?
We used to break his
balls When We Were kids.
You're into chicks that sing?
What's the problem?
Is there something I should know?.
Nothing. Honest.
Shut up before I kick your ass.
Alright. I only. I said.
You're real cute
When you're flustered.
Forget about me being cute.
I gotta tell you something.
You're a Wicked chick and all.
But look.
Just a bit further, Mare!
Goyko promised us a recording
and a remix. He knows
a guy at the studio.
We scraped together
the dough, 600 bucks.
Mare sold his guitar.
The alternator's not Working.
He sold his old man's
Black and Decker.
What? -Shh!
I sold my brother's
rock 'n' roll records. I broke
some. He'll kill me.
But that's another story.
We only just scraped
together the money, see?!
600 bucks for nothing.
I told Mare that We'd
see Goyko, We've been
buddies since school.
Goyko played dumb.
No studio. No money.
That's When I lost it...
OK. It'll start in a sec!
I walked into the office,
and really fucked him up.
I broke everything in
there! Naturally he's
pissed, he's got
some friends after me..
It's not me, it's Mare
I'm Worried about.
Talk him out of going
to 'Bedrock' please.
Bedrock, here We come!
Hey, guys, What's that?
Shit, look at that!
We'll end up as accomplices, Pop!
Wait! I just want to time him.
7,8,9,1 0.
WoW! It's Santa Claus.
Santa! What's up, man?
This and that.
NoW is that nice, eh?
You got prescriptions for those?
I was just passing by,

You can go in too.
Happy Hour, you know?.
Are you guys under cover?
Cops!
Where's Santa?
Go! Go! Go!
Guys, you're my neW friends!
Does anyone have a cigarette?
Why Santa Claus? It's not Christmas.
An ordinary man
remembers striking details.
Put on a hat and moustache
and everyone goes after Santa.
Bullshit! Their camera caught you.
So What? I like having
my picture taken!
Besides, We're all being
filmed from above.
From Where?
Satellites.
What? They're filming us now?.
Sure.
Who?
The CIA, Vatican, NASA, the Turks.
Here's a picture for everyone!
Hey, evil satellites!
Come doWn here! Fuckers!
Wait! Better: hey, you crappy satellite,

Get it? It rhymes: satellite - shite!
Wilcked!
Had enough, Santa?
I dig you guys.
I'm taking you to a party.
Yeah! et's go!
No need. We're off to 'Bedrock'.
Why? There's no rush.
Goyko is there all night.
He doesn't matter, 'Meat' matters.
Eat shit.
-Fuck off.
We'll get there, man.
Chill out. We'll settle everything.
What's there to settle?
Nothing. Relax! What's With you?
Satellite - shite, bite.
Pike!
What? et me pass.
Goyko, What's the time?
When do people get here?
Don't Worry, sWeetie.
Your job is to play,
mine's to make you a
star. I'll buy you a drink.
Come on, We're off for
a drink. What's up?
Hey, I really like that thing of yours.
What thing?
Well, aren't you jumpy!
A little vodka maybe?
A double vodka for her,
I'll have mineral water.
What a cute little T-shirt.
isten.
We'll do a compact CD.
-Seriously?!
I'm the main man, see?
It's not because you're
Kata's friend.
It's about quality.
That sort of thing can't get past me.
So, tell me, Who's the man?
Goyko.
-SWeetie!
Hey, Goyko, sorry but,
-Hold on. I'm talking!
Sorry.
Just one more thing.
The name of the band,
'Meat' sounds to me
like a butcher's shop, no?
Why? -Don't interrupt me!
Trust me. I knoW.
We'll lose the name.
I got a demo tape
from tWo idiots. Something
'hip', but really it's crap.
They gave me dough
for some studio time.
But I'm going to put that
money into your project.
What about them?
They can go fuck themselves!
A couple of idiots!
They think they're
something. Ever since school.
What? They're cool
and Goyko's the idiot.
Recording, my ass.
You knoW, drum, bass,

Who's that ringing after midnight?
I'm gonna ground you!
Hello...

What happens to you?
Nothing. A little. just a bit.
I want one too.
-Not you. No, no.
Just a half? -No, not you. No.
My name's Predrag. I'm a Capricorn.
Hey, Capricorn. Cut the crap.
Just pass the red and yellows.
I'm Kata. -No kidding!
There was a Kata from
a toWn near Marakesh.
Pretty as a picture,
even more so in the flesh.
Her eyes Were blue.What goes next?
Deep sea blue.
Attracting all the guys, eyes that Woo.
Bravo, Santa!
-Serbia!!!
Thanks. -And there's more.
No more!.
I can't remember it. -That's lucky.
Hey, is it after three?
Are there any Split fans

Just give me a minute....
Have I really got through to Split?
Hey, and the same to you.

I really don't have any problems.
I feel so fresh that it's
almost embarrassing.
Man, the chicks here

Sorry, there are like tWo bed-Worthy.
The rest are a disaster.
So, Popovich has decided
to dance With you.
Bye!
Bye!
I have tWo kinds of problems.
Those that bother me
and those With no solution.
First kind: We have a band
and gave Gojko the
Tit 1 50 bucks for a
recording.
Goyko is a tit and a shit.
but he's supposed to do us a
favor.
The other problem is that.
I'm 25 and I still live With my mom.
Honest? -No shit.
See all these people here?
We all live With our folks.
That's not the problem.
I live With my grandmother too.
Just locate your place
in the coordinate system of
confusion. Get it?
Maybe one of you could
fix my coordinate thing!
I understand them.
The Whole war thing,
the news. the situation.
Hang on. Can you really Work
this out With Goyko?
I said so, didn't l?
I don't think you get me.
Mare Will flip if he finds out.
Hey, I'm your fairy godmother!
They oWe me from before.
Hang on.
HoW come you're With Goyko?
I don't knoW.
Well, hoW did you meet?
At the movies.
First they kill his master,
then he beats them,
then they hurt his girl,
then he hits him,
then they kill his father.
Then he gets revenge. Then he's bleeding.
Hey, guys, can you keep it doWn?
What's the matter, eh?
What's your problem?
-What's our problem?!
Niggers.
Mind the cheWing gum.
Guys, let's go. Come on.
Don't be a pain. Just chill.
Yeah.
Hey, this Goyko's,

What's up? Where are you?

Don't Worry! I'm coming

There's just one problem.

Only there's a slight problem.
You're doing that
stuff With machines and
yelling, yeah?
Yeah, Why? Wanna be on the cover?

Around 1 50 bucks. Why?
You're being screWed

You've got a buddy, right?
Yeah.
Go on. What's Goyko say?
He'll transfer your
money to another project.
He doesn't give a shit about you.
Trouble is the
other project is my band.

Thanks a lot.
See you later.
Everything's alright, no?

To the very last cent. Get it?

Want some juice?
I'll get your money back.
He can't say 'no' to me.
Fat chance.

Tonight's the night

You should've bullied him

NeW coat, neW T-shirt.
What a gent!
I understand you a lot.
Good kids and all.
I was good at school - B average.
Then I realiZed: Either
leave and forget Serbia
or stay. If you stay then
there's only one option -
snatching.
That sounded kind of heavy, no?
Who thinks you're stupid?
Hold on, man.
I'm not going to play for free.
But that's our deal With Goyko.
All the others are paid.
We got a crate of beer
and some guitar strings.
Strings, my ass!
I've already broken 4
pairs of drumsticks.
The money Will come,

I Wouldn't play With you, loser.
Why not learn a couple of riffs!?
Piss off, Wonker!

Go and get them. noW.
OK. So it's 600 bucks?
What 600 bucks?
Never mind. Just

What's your band called?
We haven't given it a name yet.
It's a black tape. It says 'demo' on it.
OK.
Don't mess it up.
First the money and tape,
then you can break up.
Why are you lying again?
-Hey, Mare.

The magic is gone.
So I decided to dump you.
You're so sleaZy.
It's no Wonder the
Whole toWn hates you.
Who hates me? What toWn?
What's that? ydia!
You'll see the void

Beat it!
Ask your man Why they

Give me back that

You're bloody craZy! ldiot!
Did you break up?
What happened?
Nothing. The Tit's got a neW girl.

Pop, come here.
And noW the beginning of the end.
The Woes of youth.
