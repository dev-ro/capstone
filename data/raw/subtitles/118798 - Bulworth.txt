l`m Jay Bulworth. We stand
at the doorstep of a new millennium.
We must reduce a bloated government
and restore its creative power.
To reinvigorate our society--
My name is Jay Bulworth.
California families who work
hard and pay taxes...
...shouldn`t pay for
those who don`t.
l`m Jay Bulworth. l believe
in a hand up, not a hand down.
l need your support.
l`m Jay Bulworth. We`re at
the doorstep of a new millennium.
l`ll fight to end
affirmative action.
l`m Jay Bulworth. We`re
at the doorstep of a new millennium.
l`m Jay Bulworth. We`re
at the doorstep of a new millennium.
Our welfare system
is out of control.
l`m Jay Bulworth. We`re
at the doorstep....
Connie and l have
been married 24 years.
She`s been a loving partner,
and, more importantly, my friend.
Jay`s been a great senator...
...but his best job is
husband and father.
l believe in the values
of honesty, decency and fidelity.
Join me to strengthen
California`s families.
l`m Jay Bulworth. We stand at the
doorstep of a new millennium.
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.
We can`t afford privileges
on the basis of race.
Discrimination in the past...
...doesn`t justify it now.
l`m Jay Bulworth. We stand at
the doorstep of a new millennium.
Our welfare system is out of control.
Too often, welfare subsidizes
able-bodied people...
... who should make a living.
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.
We must reduce our bloated
federal government....
This is a phone answering machine.
Leave a message.
Pick up the phone.
l know you`re there.
Pork bellies indeed.
l`ve spoken with Hong Kong,
and l`m upset!
That`s the wrong word.
l`m pissed, pissed, pissed!
l warned you about Fenner
and his harebrained...
...pork-belly schemes.
And now l hear...
...you invested everything you had...
...and they`re selling short!
The senator would love
to have drinks with the Sultan.
ls he in Beverly Hills?
-Has he buzzed yet?
-No.
-Feldman call?
-lt`s 6:1 5 a.m. in L.A.
So? Get Liebowitz and Macavoy.
l`ve got two hands.
l can`t grow another.
l didn`t ask you to.
Make the calls.
And Mr. Chow? What about Mr. Ling?
Did his check clear?
Hey, senator.
lt`s a beautiful morning.
Birds are singing. Leaves are...
...doing whatever leaves do.
You eat anything?
lt`s Friday.
That pizza`s from Wednesday.
Did Fenner call?
You sold short and they`re up.
l mean, is that a disaster?
Do l look like a disaster to you?
The polls aren`t good.
We`re down by four points.
But the new spots
are huge. Sunday brunch...
...will bring us $900 grand.
-They`ll ask about the insurance bill.
-Which one?
Makes insurance companies
sell it to poor people.
-That`s good.
-Not for the companies.
-We work for them?
-We do, or we don`t have jobs.
We`re trying to get 50 grand a table.
Missy Berliner, Los Angeles Times.
Last week, your challenger...
...said you were ''an old liberal wine
trying to pour himself...
...into a conservative bottle.''
We`re at the doorstep
of a new millennium.
-That mistake can hurt.
-What?
''Both sides'' remark.
Hi, Constance.
Murphy, do you think l have nothing
better to do than wait around?
l don`t mind helping, but you could...
...get your staff to show
some respect for my time.
What about ''both sides''?
We said we`d go with,
''l`ll get back to you.''
''Both sides'' says
the other side is worth considering.
-Where`s Becky?
-She doesn`t want to do this.
ls she mad?
She`s 1 7. Send her
money, she`ll be fine.
-Smile in the back.
-That`s it.
Any other help you can give, make...
...the check payable
to ''Bulworth `96.''
Cholesterol, liver function,
blood pressure, EKG, all fine.
-Are you eating?
-No, thanks.
Have you experienced
a loss of appetite?
l`m not hungry, thanks.
When did you eat?
Will the Wangs be in California?
-Hello, Helen.
-Hello, Mr. Crockett.
Mr. Crockett,
American lnsurance Federation.
Jay? Jay?
Are you saying you haven`t eaten
or slept in three days?
You should talk to someone.
l`ll give you a name.
Milton Alexander, a psychiatrist.
l have a meeting.
This bill will devastate us.
-Crockett.
-l`ll call back.
-How`s he doing?
-Fine.
-How are you doing?
-Fine.
-You?
-Fine.
Can you believe this bill?
ls the whole world going insane?
Consider the strain in relationships
with state commissioners.
Or rate changes.
This will cost us billions.
The usual people are making trouble.
l don`t mean African-Americans.
l have no problem with
African-Americans.
Dr. Martin Luther King,
Colin Powell, Michael Jordan.
l have no problem with them.
They have jobs.
Throw down some lazy,
welfare-taking...
...drug-dealing, rap-singing
punk, and say my people...
...have to give him a policy.
So he can burn down his house,
smoke crack and get AlDS?
You can`t get AlDS
by burning a house.
Vinnie!
Vinnie, you son of a bitch!
How are you?
How you been?
Other than a prostate like
a coffeecake, terrific.
-Not to use an old phrase, but--
-The bill`s un-American.
l have confidence that you can
bottle up this bill in committee.
What`s that?
Your homeowner`s insurance,
disability, liability...
...and a few million dollars in
life insurance.
-l`ve always had 10.
-What?
-Ten million.
-Pesos?
Senator.
What we said was a couple million,
paid to your daughter--
Four payments, 2.5 million each
to my daughter.
Would five do it?
Why don`t we say seven?
Ten is a whole hell of a lot
of life insurance.
lf Jay Bulworth plays ball,
we`ll play ball.
-Senator, this is Vinnie.
-How are you?
Ready for the research project?
Davers, can you excuse us? Thanks.
Senator, l`ll be right outside.
Small bills.
Must l use Davers to talk to you?
Davers can always reach me.
Did he ask you what the weekend
research project was?
Good. Nobody knows but you and me.
You and me, senator.
Here are photos of the person.
Give them to whoever`s doing the--
-Research.
-Research.
First time l`ve gotten
a guy to off a guy...
-...not knowing who it is.
-You mean research.
-Yeah, research.
-You said you didn`t have to know.
l don`t wanna know who it is.
l don`t want nobody knowing about me.
We need to talk, we call Eddie Davers.
Nobody knows nothing.
Except one thing.
-What?
-Who`s the guy?
-You just said--
-That was in the abstract.
We`re really doing it, you
don`t tell me who this is....
Simple math.
Take a look.
Excuse me.
-What`s the gag?
-He arrives at LAX...
...tomorrow night at 8:40
on American Airlines.
Second half of the money. lf l`m not
dead by Monday, l`ll stop payment.
Thank you for flying with us.
Have a pleasant stay in Los Angeles.
As you exit,
flight agents will direct you...
...to any connecting flights.
Have a nice day.
Welcome back to California.
We`re running late, so let me
go over some changes.
The total from the brunch is 1 .1 .
We got two from oil,
and lawyers just south of 100.
Gloria Alred got excited over
your O.J. statement.
Even the women came in with about 65.
Our new schedule is a black
church, then Beverly Hills.
He`s here.
-You should drink with the Sultan.
-He`s nuts.
-Welcome home.
-What`s this?
24 hours on the Campaign Trail.
This is Gary Plunkett of C-SPAN.
Fred Tinsdale and Mimi Binder.
Mimi and l will be behind
you in the truck.
C-SPAN will be with us all night?
All weekend. The show
airs tomorrow at 2.
-Where are we going?
-First stop is South Central.
Did you get a copy of the schedule?
We`ll be busy.
The African-American community.
Your African-American constituents
don`t forget how you helped.
-Where are we going?
-Grace Church, senator.
-Fred?
-What?
-Have you covered Bulworth?
-These go by the book.
ln Beverly Hills we meet
big names in entertainment.
Scotty, how are you?
Vivian, Rwanda. My goodness.
l didn`t expect you to be here.
How are you feeling?
Did you sleep on the plane?
Did Mr. Murphy forget someone?
Murphy, the senator--
Whoops.
Senator? Senator Bulworth.
The senator from California,
Senator Jay Billington Bulworth.
That`s a nice piece of timing.
-Amen.
-Senator...
...your speech, sir.
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.
Listen. l put some time in this.
--restore its creative power.
To reinvigorate our society...
...and bring about
a rebirth of democracy.
Any questions?
Nice. Less is more.
After the riots, you promised...
...funding to rebuild.
What happened?
What happened was...
...we all knew it was big news,
so we came down here...
...Bush, Clinton,
Wilson, all of us...
...told you what you wanted
to hear and forgot about it.
-Did you hear that?
-Let`s see where he goes.
We can`t get any insurance here.
Health or life insurance.
Why aren`t you in favor of Bill 2720?
You haven`t contributed any
money to my campaign, have you?
Know how much insurance
companies give?
They depend on me to bottle up
the bill in my committee.
Then we can kill it.
When you say ''by the book,''
what book is that?
-Democrats don`t care about us?
-lsn`t it obvious?
Your kids are either
jobless or in jail.
Do you see any Democrat
doing anything about it?
Certainly not me.
What`ll you do, vote Republican?
You know you`re not.
Let`s call a spade a spade.
l mean, you can have
a Billion Man March.
lf you don`t support somebody
other than...
...a running back who
stabs his wife...
...you`ll never get rid
of somebody like me.
Fire! Fire!
Fire alarm, Nina, let`s be out!
This way, senator.
What are you doing?
That was good.
That was really good.
Does anybody know where the fire is?
Where`s the fire? l don`t
understand where it is.
lt`s very worrying that in 1 990
in L.A. black churches are burning.
Smoke? l don`t smell shit.
l don`t know where the fire is.
We have to be going. Thank you.
Senator!
We`re into politics.
We want to work on your campaign.
We want to volunteer.
-On to Beverly Hills.
-We really into politics.
-Nina.
-l hope the fire department gets here.
-Yo.
-Yo to you.
-Later.
-l was hoping sooner.
-What`d you say?
-Later is good.
-You macking on my sister?
-No macking here.
Senator, l think we should go.
We have to go.
-My friends want to volunteer.
-Volunteer?
We didn`t hear
the heart of your speech.
You have support in this area.
-Nina.
-Oh, yes.
You can`t deny the value
of a frank exchange.
What does ''mack'' mean?
Macavoy, what does ''mack'' mean?
''Macking on my sister.''
Senator, your opponent,
Hugh Weldie, has just...
...leapt on the neoconservative
bandwagon.
ls your sciatic nerve
bothering you again?
No, l`m fine.
Our people find Weldie`s
duplicity particularly....
You`ve had a tough day.
l`ll cover for you at
the Liebowitzes`.
Cover? After all the money we
worked these guys for?
-They give us more than the Chinese.
-Tell you what.
l have an idea. Pull over.
Gary, you and l
will go to headquarters.
That`s a good idea. Let`s do that.
We`ll meet in Beverly Hills.
This is better. You`ll get a real
look at how a campaign operates.
You eat on the plane, sir?
-Nope.
-When did you last eat?
Wednesday.
Pull in here. l`m starving.
Let`s get some chicken wings.
This is getting uncomfortable.
A third of the guests have left,
a third are drunk.
When will he be here?
Any second. He`s had such a day.
My guess is he`s working out a new
guarantee with the State Department.
-A new guarantee?
-The West Bank.
Didn`t hear it from me.
He`ll be here soon.
Senator Bulworth...
...here we are, volunteer valets!
You know Manny
and Dorothy Liebowitz.
Hi, it`s good to see you.
Sid Sheinberg and Lew Wasserman
left...
...but security of the West Bank is...
...more important than
your being here.
-l got a bite.
-Come in.
We`ll be out soon.
We can`t ask the Liebowitzes...
...to open their home to television.
Nonsense. Mi casa es su casa.
Miss. Thank you very much.
Do you think
the entertainment business...
...needs government help to limit...
...sex and violence in today`s
films and TV?
You know, the funny thing is how...
...lousy your stuff is.
You make violent films, dirty films
and family films.
Most of them aren`t good, are they?
So many smart people...
...can work so hard, spend so much
money and make so much money.
What is it?
lt must be the money.
lt turns everything to crap.
But how much money do you need?
Miss, be honest
and don`t spare my feelings.
Are there more crispy crabcakes?
Wait. Just wait. You can`t--
Why do you schedule campaign stops
with industry leaders...
...when you don`t like their product?
My guys aren`t stupid.
They always schedule the big Jews.
-You`re mostly Jews, right?
-Excuse me?
There`s something
bad about Farrakhan in here.
Thank you, senator.
l know l speak for you when l say
l`m energized by this.
Replay that crabcakes remark.
That`s just great.
Everyone was very challenged
by your candor.
Let Bob Dole smoke that.
Get out! You`re all fired!
Fuck you! We`re volunteers.
You can`t fire volunteers.
We stayed too long, anyway.
We out!
-You want a ride?
-Yeah.
Get the stuff.
Get in the limo, big butt.
-Where we going?
-Where can we drop you?
To La Brea. We`ll get a bus there.
-We going down to Frankie`s.
-Frankie`s? We`ll take you.
-l don`t want to go.
-What`s Frankie`s?
-We`re going.
-Let`s go, Macavoy.
l can`t stand when people
flex their authority.
Don`t feel bad about going
to the hotel...
...and getting some sleep.
Letterman is no Arsenio Hall.
-He`s a two-minute brother.
-You buggin`.
l heard the head of his jimmy
is big as an apple.
Let`s look at the new
30-second spot.
What do you know about his jimmy?
-Jimmy?
-Shanequa James saw it.
-You mean his dick!
-l like you serving the potato salad.
Very dynamic.
She gave him the nappy dugout.
-Nappy dugout?
-Man got a nine-inch jimmy.
She booty-ugly. How you hit that?
Nappy dugout. Hit it.
Some of the nappy--
Frisbee tricks.
Ladies, the senator has a meeting
with the cardinal in the morning.
lf l meet with them,
can l dump the sultan?
Let me just make a security check.
Bulworth!
You got your pail or mop?
Can you sing, Bulworth?
You couldn`t be a ghost.
You got to sing. Be a spirit.
That`s how these niggas got here.
Ghosts got them.
Be a spirit!
The spirit will not descend
without song.
You got to sing, fool.
Don`t be no ghost, Bulworth.
-No cameras.
-Tough break, Gary.
l thought they`d let you in...
...but the camera must
make them nervous.
-He with you?
-He all right.
Check your weapons.
l don`t think we have any weapons.
-Expecting trouble?
-No.
His family owns a pork shop
for five years. Go on, you`re good.
Good to see you, my friend. That`s--
What you said at the church? Brave.
lf you haven`t been able
to talk to me, you can now.
-Stand by the door.
-Why?
-Lookout.
-No one can get in.
Good work. Sit down.
Senator?
Sir, if you`re having-- Excuse me.
l need to talk to him.
lf you`re having...
...a problem, we should talk about it.
What are you concerned about?
That you told 300 people
in a black church...
...they`re not a factor as long as
we`re ruled by insurance.
You went to a fundraiser...
...and told people
their product is lousy.
As many of them are Jewish...
...you thought it prudent
to mock their paranoia.
We`re in an after-hours club in
Compton on the eve of the campaign.
Where there`s illegal activity,
and you`re smoking marijuana.
You call the shots.
l can do my job much better...
...if you just tell me:
what is this new strategy?
Have a drink, Murphy. Live your life.
Bartender.
What are you doing here?
Chillin`?
Damn! Leroy, get over here.
Have a drink on me.
Look who`s here. Clint Eastwood.
-That ain`t Clint Eastwood.
-What do you mean?
-That`s George Hamilton.
-George Hamilton?
He got a TV show. Hey, George...
-...what`s up, man?
-Goddamn.
-He with you?
-Yeah.
What`s happening?
l don`t care who you know.
You can`t come in.
What you doing?
This is fun, but l`m telling
Macavoy to get ready to go.
Put it away. Stop.
-You lost, mister?
-How you doing?
This place isn`t for you.
Can we talk?
This place is for real niggas.
He ain`t no nigga.
-l ain`t what?
-You ain`t a real nigga.
-ls you a real nigga?
-What`d you say?
Don`t call me nigga,
motherfucker.
Would you prefer motherfucker?
What the fuck?
-You can`t call me no motherfucker.
-Shit.
-What?
-Get out of here.
-l don`t need you covering me.
-Move it.
-Where you going?
-Get in your car and go.
l saw you rush your brother out.
He owes me money.
You`d bust a cap up his ass.
Motherfucker rip off L.D., he`s dead.
Straight up.
l give everybody protection. Right?
l can give you protection or pain.
lt`s wrong to embarrass me.
Wrong...
...and detrimental to my life.
That motherfucker owes me money.
l`m working on getting it.
l`m tired of playing with you.
You always say that.
l said l`ll get it.
The only reason his legs ain`t snapped
is he`s your brother.
What l really want to know
ls where did little Nina go?
l`m looking here and there
But l can`t find her anywhere
Where, oh, where
ls little Nina?
l`m hunting for Nina
Hello, Nina
Where you beena?
Nina, Nina
Has anybody seen her?
Nina, Nina
Where you beena?
You`re the prettiest girl--
Leave.
Okay, okay, you come downstairs
And then we`ll play.
Excuse me. Coming through. Sorry.
Watch yourself, motherfucker!
-You sorry-ass motherfucker!
-l`m sorry.
Keep walking, bitch.
l`ll whip your ass.
l`ll give you $5 to buy a new suit!
Excuse me. l`m sorry.
-He won`t leave.
-He`s not tired?
l doubt he`s slept
in the past five days.
-What?
-He`s rhyming now.
-Rhyming?
-Rhyming. He`s talking in rhymes.
lt`s very, very disconcerting.
Nina, Nina l`m over here
This is good, give it a chance
l never even knew that l could dance
Some people can
And some people can`t
l don`t care
lf l split my pants
We had a next-door neighbor
who`d lose her mind.
What`s weird was when she was like
that, she`d only speak in lyrics.
You look pretty beat
You`ll feel better
With ribs to eat
Eat `em
You`ll think they`re fine
lf you want more
You can get them any time
l`m incredibly frightened.
That George Hamilton sure can move.
Hey, guys!
-Senator, sir!
-The fundraiser!
Senator Bulworth?
The Beverly Wilshire fundraiser
starts in five minutes!
The brunch begins in five minutes,
but are you up to speaking?
Up? What`s up?
Perhaps Barbara Boxer should talk.
-lt`ll be fine.
-Are you sure?
-Hey, we had a good time.
-You`re very tired, sir.
lt`ll be fine.
Just give me the speech.
You girls want breakfast
at the Beverly Wilshire? Where`s Nina?
We could drop you at that
chicken-and-waffles place on Highland.
-Where`s Nina?
-She said she`d see you later.
Oh, okay.
lt`ll be fine.
He got it out of his system.
Don`t worry. l`ll be fine this time.
You can get some sleep at the hotel
after the fundraiser.
Shower and shave, maybe.
Freshen up for the rest
of our agenda.
Macavoy, Beverly Wilshire.
Give me the speech, Murphy.
Don`t worry.
l tell you, the man is a rock.
He looked at me and said,
''This bill is un-American.''
Good, the bill`s still in committee.
l got Jay Bulworth on this baby.
l`m sure all he needed
was a good meal and sleep.
Senator? Your speech, sir.
Go get them.
Hi, Constance.
Rough night at the prom?
We`re back on track.
How`s Edward?
-Edgar.
-l like Edgar. l`ve always liked him.
-Knock it off!
-Once in a generation....
--are the life of the people
he represents.
Such is the man who has served
the people of California...
...Senator Jay Billington Bulworth.
Thank you, Bill Stone.
We stand on the doorstep
of a new millennium.
We have an obligation...
...on one hand, to reduce....
Yadda, yadda, yadda...
...yadda.
lt`s up to the people to decide...
...what the state of California
and the nation will do.
Ooh, what`ll we do
The nation will do
lt`s up to you
What`ll we do
What`ll we do
lt`s up to you
lt ain`t funny
You contribute money
You make a contribution
You get a solution
When you pay
l`ll do it your way
Yes, the money talks
And the people walk
Let me hear you say it
Big money
-Big money, big money!
-Big money.
One man, one vote
ls that really real?
Let`s make a deal
People got their problems
Haves and have-nots
The ones that make me listen
Pay for 30-second spots
Thirty seconds
Thirty seconds
Bank of America, this table here
Wells Fargo, you`re really dear
Loan billions to Mexico, never fear
Taxpayers take it in the rear
Take it in the rear
Take it in the rear
We got our friends from oil
Don`t care that the wilderness spoils
They say they`re careful
We know it`s a lie
-They`ll let the planet die
-Let the planet die.
Exxon, Mobil, Saudis and Kuwait
The atmosphere can wait
Arabs got the oil
We buy what they sell
Raise the price
We`ll blow them to hell
Let me hear you say it
Saddam!
Hussein!
Saddam!
Hussein!
Get me a phone number.
A Dr. Morris Fishman, UCLA.
Psychiatry department.
Go get the number!
Everybody gonna get sick someday
But nobody know how to pay
Health care, managed care, HMOs
Ain`t gonna work
No, not those
The thing is the same
ln all of these
These motherfuckers
lnsurance companies
lnsurance, insurance.
Call it single-payer
Or Canadian Way
Only socialized medicine
Will save the day
Let me hear that dirty word
-Socialism!
-Socialism!
Women in the world
Mistreated and abused
We try to fix it
We get confused
Sisters say, ``That`s my style``
One thing in politics makes me smile
l like the pussy
l like it really fine
Be a senator
Get it all the time
Young, old, l like `em all
ln Washington you hardly have to call
lf you don`t pull their rug out
They give you nappy dugout
Would we be eligible
for an Emmy or a Peabody?
Will rap be a part
of your campaign?
A part of my campaign
Now that just sounds insane
They love it.
Campaign finance reform
is your key issue?
lt`s the only way to go
lf they pay the piper
The piper does their show
You got that right, senator.
Bye, fellas!
lf you`d wait in here
for a moment, sir.
l`ll be back to take you to the car.
Patricia lreland is expected in town.
Will you have a meeting with her?
Hi. That speech was phat.
-Phat?
-You got a room here?
A room we can go to upstairs?
-A room.
-A room.
What do you wanna do?
Proceed to church, then the debate?
Or we can shut down. Dr. Fishman`s

My call. lt`s my call?

Feldman?
Feldman?
Yes, sir.
Feldman, could l have

-The room?
-The room upstairs.
Oh, sure.
-Feldman?
-Yeah?
-The key?
-Right. Sorry.
-What?
-l`m sorry, it`s in the car.
He needs his room key.
Senator, we have to get
in the car now, sir.
Key`s in the car. Let`s go.
What do you say we
get you 40 winks?
-Nina and l are going to the room.
-That`s not a good idea.
You and her, now?
l got a better idea.
You and l get in the limo
and circle back when you want to.
Why would l?
Will the insurance industry
respond well?
Senator, where is the nappy dugout?
The nappy dugout`s
Where you get the bug out
-Who are the girls?
-They`re friends, can`t you see
Feldman, Feldman
Where`s that key
You got the key in your hand.
You got the life. Ain`t it grand?
You got the life.
You got to be a spirit.
Can`t be no ghost.
You got it all, Bulworth.
Ain`t life grand? Ain`t it grand?
You got the life, man.
Let`s go, Macavoy. We`re moving.
Get the phone. l need Davers.
You got to be a spirit, not a ghost!
-Do you know where Davers is?
-No, sir.
-Maybe at our next stop.
-You`ve had a crushing weekend--
This is Eddie Davers.
Leave a message.
You should get sleep.
Davers, it`s the senator.
Once you get this message...
...call the man you introduced me to.
Tell him he has to cancel
the weekend research project.
That`s important.
See you at the church.
Macavoy, the church.
We drop our supporters off.
Where can we take you young ladies?
Senator, what a pleasure.
ls Mrs. Bulworth under the weather?
She`s fine.
l`ll be with you shortly.
-You got a choir in church?
-Watch out, l`m with the network.
Get in there and find Davers.
Cancel the project.
The weekend research project
has be canceled.
Macavoy, go in there and find Davers.
l gotta find Davers.
-You see him?
-No.
We`re honored by the attendance
of U.S. Senator Jay Bulworth.
Let us rejoice...
...in his presence
and sing hymn number 376.
-Out of the car.
-Why?
l got some problems,
and you`re not safe with me.
-What does that mean?
-Just gotta get--
-Are you afraid of somebody?
-Yeah.
lf you`re so afraid,
why not tell me why?
-l just need a guy to call a guy.
-Why don`t you call yourself?
l don`t know how.
-Okay. Let`s go back to the hotel.
-l gotta stay out of sight.
lt is worse than arrogance.
lt is contempt for the press
and contempt for the people.
Have you heard that
Gephardt`s looking for somebody?
l`ll stay out of sight till he
gets back. We`ll wait in the car.
Hi, Mimi. We seem to have lost
our ride to the debate.
-Could we catch a ride with you?
-He split with the limo?
So who walks in? Huey Newton.
You know who Huey Newton was?
A lot of people l talk to, black,
your age, have no idea.
Huey.
Why are there no more black leaders?
Some say because they all got killed.
l think it`s the decimation
of urban manufacturing base.
An optimistic population throws up
optimistic leaders.
Shift manufacturing
to the Third World...
...you destroy the blue-collar core
of the black people.
Some would say the problem
is cultural.
The media`s controlled
by fewer people.
Add to that, a consumer culture
based on self-gratification.
lt`s unlikely they want leaders
calling for sacrifice.
lf l look at the economy,
domestic employment...
...means jobs for African-Americans.
World War ll meant
jobs for black folks.
That energized the civil rights
movement...
...of the 50s and 60s.
Energized communities...
...produce leaders.
Leaders they`ll respond to.
What do you think?
-What do you think my age is?
-Your age?
You said black people my age.
Twenty-three?
Twenty-six.
All right, how old do you think l am?
How old?
Sixty.
My mother was a Panther.
Huey fed kids on my block.
Senator, aren`t you
late for the debate?
Davers, Davers, Davers.
l`ve been looking for you everywhere.
We have to call Vinnie.
You know what l get out of
this place? Bupkus.
Talk to you later.
-lt`s Nina.
-You fucking bimbo.
l couldn`t get him up to the room.
You weren`t supposed
to push him off.
All you had to do is get
him upstairs. l`ve had it!
Vinnie, wait.
Don`t ''Vinnie'' me.
You move on to plan B.
What the fuck is plan B?
You know plan B.
And you better get it done.
You said if l get him up
to the room l`d get 10 Gs.
-Fucking bimbo.
-Vinnie!
Vinnie! Davers.
The senator wants to speak to you.
Hey, Vinnie, my friend! How are you?
l`m very relieved to get
in touch with you.
We`re gonna have to call off
the weekend research project.
-Call it off?
-ls it a problem?
-Not a problem.
-Change of plans.
But look, you keep the fee,
by all means.
-ls that a problem?
-No.
Good! Good, good, Vinnie.
Let me ask you a favor. Can we
keep this between the two of us?
You and me, and whoever
you got doing this thing?
-We`re gonna need a surcharge.
-Fine.
-Cancellation fee.
-Okay, just keep the check.
No, an additional $50,000.
An additional.... Good.
l`ll send Davers over...
...with another check.
Shall we consider it done?
-Yeah.
-Wonderful. Wonderful.
Good. Thanks, Vinnie, thanks.
You`re welcome.
Crazy motherfucker.
What is a ''weekend research project''?
lt`s nothing. lt`s all off.
The guy is nuts.
-l don`t feel good.
-Want something?
Vinnie, you want something?
Vinnie?
-l gotta go. l`m out.
-All right!
All right!
We`re late, we`re late
For a very important debate
l`m feeling great
While feeling my fate
Senator! Senator, you want
some fresh clothes?
lf you want to hide, l got the place.
You think after this crap is over,
maybe you could hang?
-Hang?
-Hang. Hang out with me?
Oh, hang. Hang out.
-What do you think?
-Yeah.
l got the plan.
Wanna meet my family tonight?
That would-- Great.
That`s great
l got a whole new slate
l meet the family
l can hardly wait
l think he`s recognizing
the situation...
-...and getting some sleep.
-There`s....
Okay, listen to me.
l won`t let him on TV
until there`s some explanation.
We`ll say he got sick,
stuck in traffic.
We`ll stand here and block him,
arms akimbo if needed.
Prevent him from doing
damage to his and our careers.
l`m explicitly authorizing
the use of force.
-Murphy, Feldman, Macavoy.
-Hi, boss.
Didn`t work, but he`s okay now.
Got the razor?
-Got it.
-Get him to shave.
They`re ready.
How about a quick shave?
The format agreed to is as follows:
Questions will be addressed
to each candidate...
...in alternating order.
Candidates have two minutes to answer.
The other has one minute to reply.
The first candidate has
30 seconds for a final comment.
Each candidate will make
a final statement.
Mr. Weldie won the
drawing of lots, he`s elected to....
l was supposed to set him up,
not do it.
Now l can`t get Vinnie on the phone.
The first question
is for Senator Bulworth.
We have to ask about the change
in your campaign style.
Come on. Why are you here?
Let`s admit it,
because you`re making a bundle.
-l beg your pardon?
-You`re not here because of the money?
Come on. We got three rich guys
here getting paid by some...
...really rich guys to ask
a couple of other rich guys...
...questions about their campaign.
But our campaigns are financed
by the same guys that pay you.
So why are we talking?
l`m bringing him down.
They can kiss my ass.
l could tell you stories
about getting money.
Stories about me.
l don`t know about....
Hugh, do you have that...?
But l tell you...
... we got a club.
Republicans, Democrats...
... what`s the difference?
Your guys, my guys, it`s club.
So why don`t we just have a drink?
Hugh? No?
Hugh, if you win, think about
where you put your kids in school.
We put our daughter
in Sidwell Friends.
Any public school is a disaster.
Excuse me, senator,
at the moment we`re here...
-...to ask about the news of your--
-News?
The guys we get our money from
don`t want the people to have news.
Corporations are more efficient.
Know why health care
is the most profitable?
lnsurance takes 24 cents
out of a dollar spent.
For the government to do the same
for Medicare takes three cents.
What`s this crap about business
being efficient?
What the hell is going on?
They need to be regulated.
You think they`ll regulate themselves?
What`s going on?
Gentlemen, it seems
as if we`re experiencing...
...technical difficulties.
Hey, Hugh, what`s up? What`s up?
What`s happening, baby? Huh?
l`m bringing him down there,
goddamn it.
Stand by. We`re experiencing
technical difficulties.
What`s going on?
Are we gonna do this?
We`re doing the best we can.
Oh, hi, Davers. Power failure.
He wants to crash and burn
his entire career? Fine.
Fuck him!
But l`ll be damned
if he takes us down with him.
l`ve been completely loyal
to that fucker.
l`ve had other offers, you know.
Plenty.
Didn`t he have it all, though?
Looks, brains, more or less,
classy wife.
But Jesus Christ, Bill, he had us.
The motherfucker had us.
lf he had listened to me
on welfare reform in `88.
lf he`d just chased
not quite so much pussy...
...could`ve gone all the way.
We still might.
But now, with this shit,
we`re fucked in the ass.
Fucked with our pants down!
Cocksucker!
Fuck.
Hi, Larry.
Murphy, Murphy, Murphy.
How the hell are you?
-Ever seen anything like this?
-lt is very unusual stuff.
-l don`t know what to say.
-l`d say...
...l`m gonna have to do
a show on this.
Oh, my God, Larry.
Come on, do you have to?
-Are you sure?
-Are you kidding? He`s on a roll.
They want him.
People are sick of this baloney.
-l want him on my show.
-That`s what l told him.
The man`s got this giant vision!
lt`s so gratifying
that he`s listening.
That`s between you and me.
What are we talking about?
-Tonight?
-We got Clinton.
Bump him! Just kidding.
How about tomorrow?
-Book him.
-We`ll call you.
-Nobody`s seen this for years.
-This is it! Your boy is it!
-He`s it.
-You`ve got insight.
No, you`ve got insight,
you`re the guy who saw it.
Senator, l`m afraid we`re
gonna have to cancel this.
They don`t wanna bump Jerry Springer.
Sorry, folks.
Senator, do you feel like
you need a vacation?
-Does it get to you?
-No. Why?
l`m confused.
l like to play ball...
...but you all play much rougher.
l`ll be outside.
-l have your policy.
-Oh, forget it. l don`t need it.
-Everything okay?
-Okay is not the word for it.
Pork bellies are way down,
and you`re back in the chips.
-Did you deliver the check?
-Poor guy.
-What?
-He collapsed.
-What? He collapsed?
-He had a heart attack.
When you have a moment,
we have to sit down.
Did he cancel the project?
-l guess so.
-You guess so?
He was in a coma. l left the check.
-Where is he?
-Cedars, intensive care.
You turned off the power!
He told the truth!
You didn`t want the American people
to hear what he had to say, Frank!
Go sit with him until he wakes up.
Ask him if he...
...canceled the research project.
lf he didn`t...
...ask him who`s he gotta call.
-Okay, boss.
-Senator....
Get out!
Get out of the car.
You gotta get out!
You`re crazy, Bulworth.
Larry King`s pissed,
and he`s not alone!
How about the FCC? Ever heard of
the F-fucking-CCC?
Now, you listen to me.
You`re running an election special
tonight. Guess what?
l want my candidate on.
Are we hiding again?
Because l said l got a safe place.
Safe?
Safe.
Senator, l think we`re back on track.
You gotta be here at 7:30.
State of American Politics.
Dole, Clinton, and a piece on you.
lt`s five minutes...
...guaranteed. Live, no delay.
Why ''Oh, no''? Just be back at 7:30.
By the way, you doing your own
driving-- lt`s very effective, sir.
Jam? You`re not in a jam, sir.
People are sick of all the baloney!
But you didn`t want to play it safe.
lt`s not the time for safe.
Where are you?
Senator Bulworth?
l`m losing you, sir.
Hello? Hello?
Senator Bulworth?
Senator Bulworth?
Wait here.
Come on in.
Hey, y`all.
This is Senator Jay Bulworth.
l`m Governor Tyrone Pinkney.
Osgood, my secretary of state and
my attorney general, Denisha.
-Momma Doll, we`re feeding the senator.
-Senator?
Gotta clean that suit before
you go on TV.
Marcus Garvey, get him some pants.
Get some pants.
How you doing?
At a fundraising
brunch today, Bulworth...
...raised a million
and a half dollars.
Contributors were non-committal
when asked about...
...his anti-business remarks.
Momma Doll is me and Tyrone`s mama.
And Rafeeq is Tyrone`s son by Vanetta,
who died in `83.
And Nina and Darnell`s mama passed.
She was the baby.
l`m gonna tell him
l`m going to the cleaners.
The lights are low
Between your legs l`ll go
-Don`t play with your food.
-He`s doing no harm.
lf he is, l`ll tell him.
l`m gonna check on the suit.
Taking too long.
Where are you going?
Cleaners.
-Like your greens, general? Senator?
-l love collard greens.
That`s kale.
Oh. Kale.
Nothing. Doctor says
there`s no telling.
Just wait there till he wakes up.
Where`s the cleaners?
Two blocks down?
You`re going outside here?
Yo.
Motherfucker. You buying?
Buying or what?
l`m going to the cleaners.
Fuck you.
Fuck me.
We doing business.
Wouldn`t you rather have ice cream?
l`m buying.
You let that man go out there?
l go out there every day.
lf l can go, he can go.
Senator should be okay among
his own constituents.
You spooks find some extra cash today?
Fuck you.
You black piece of shit.
You say ''Fuck you''?
No, sir.
l said fuck your mama.
Hey! Come on.
Everybody freeze! Freeze! Freeze!
Hey, you! Freeze!
Faggot! Get down, or l`ll
blow your brains out!
What`s your badge number?
-On the ground, now!
-You better give me your name.
Shut up! Get on the ground,
and do it now!
Get on the ground, or l`ll...
...blow your brains out!
Mark. Mark, it`s Jay Bulworth.
This is Senator Jay Bulworth, Mark.
l don`t give a--
Senator?
Senator Bulworth,
this is my partner, Mark.
Hi, Mark.
What the fuck is going on here, sir?
lf you two go now, l won`t be able
to identify you.
l think it`s a good idea
to say ''l`m sorry.''
l`ve waited my whole life for this.
-l`m...sorry.
-Say, ''No problem, officer.''
Go fuck your mama, you pig.
That`s good enough. Take off, huh?
Yo, look. L.D.
You looking for Nina?
The guy gets the biggest opportunity...
...of his life. What does he do?
Decides he may not show up.
And why not?
''l don`t want to talk about it.''
You don`t? You were on a fucking roll.
Wanna see me balance a spoon
on my nose?
Shit.
Where`s Nina?
Good looking-out. Ain`t often
a white man rescues my little soldiers.
-l appreciate it.
-Little soldiers?
What do you know about it?
Your ass live in Beverly Hills
somewhere, right?
l provide for these brothers.
These little brothers is my eyes
and ears out there.
Where`s Nina?
l`m giving them entry-level positions
into the only...
...growth occupation open to them:
The substance supply industry.
They`ll run this shit someday.
You greedy politicians
don`t give a fuck.
That`s what you say every time you cut
school programs...
...and funds to job programs.
How can a man support himself
working at motherfucking Burger King?
And don`t even start with school shit.
No education`s going on because
you politicians fucked it up.
So what`s a young man to do?
What will he do?
He`ll come to me, because
l`m a businessman.
These shorties are a businessman`s
limited liabilities...
...because of their limited
vulnerability to legal sanctions.
lt`s the same in politics.
Find an edge, exploit it.
That`s why you sent them teenagers
to lraq.
Die over some motherfucking oil.
Send the ClA...
...slangin` in the `hood.
Same shit in politics.
A homie got to risk his neck and fight
For what he believes
And he gotta preach it right
lf he don`t got shit to die for
Afraid to shed the light
He ain`t got shit to live for
Scumbag
ls that how white people rap?
You gonna hang with this man?
Ain`t it enough your mama`s life was
ruined by a white man?
Tyrone, l ain`t my mama.
-l hate to see you get involved.
-You got no idea what l`m involved in.
Tonight, Bill Clinton, Bob Dole,
Jay Bulworth...
...Alan Simpson, Bill Bradley,
Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot...
...all appearing live on American
Politics Election Special.
-What do you think?
-What do l think?
L.D., fucker took your car.
-He took my car?
-lt`s gone.
Go get everyone.
Let`s get on the news.
Do we have any idea where Bulworth is?
Give him two minutes.
lrving, do we have Buchanan?
lt`s about time that people started
saying ''Ebonics.''
Excuse me. Senator Bulworth,
is that you?
Senator Bulworth?
-Should you put on a coat and tie?
-What`s happening, man?
l`m gonna have to get that tan.
l like the glasses, but...
...l think you should have
longer pants.
Actually, the shorter pants have
a certain urban, youthful quality.
The glasses are good, but l`d like
to see your eyes.
Budweiser on the blimp?
''Get drunk and fly.''
Fidelity Providence
has been helping families....
Senator, the glasses.
That`s the style, isn`t it?
That`s the style.
--providing health plans,
life insurance...
...for the changing face of America.
You can trust Fidelity Providence.
Welcome back.
We have incumbent Democratic Senator
Jay Bulworth. Good evening, senator.
Senator, why this new campaign style?
Why the new manner of dress
and speech?
Your ethnic manner of speech,
your clothes.
-The use of obscenity.
-Obscenity?
The rich gets richer while
The middle class gets more poor
Making billions
And billions and billions
And billions of bucks
lf you weren`t rich at the start
That situation sucks
`Cause the richest motherfucker
ln five of us
ls getting 98 percent of it
And every other motherfucker
ls left to wonder where
We went with it-- Obscenity?
l`m a senator. l got to raise
$10,000 a day in D.C.
l don`t get it in South Central,
but in Beverly Hills.
l vote in the Senate the way they
want and l send my bills.
Babies in South Central
die as young as in Peru
Schools are nightmares and
Congress ain`t got a clue
Kids have submachine guns
Militias throw bombs
Bill just gets weepy
Newt`s blaming teenage moms
Factories closing down
Where did the good jobs go?
l`ll tell you where
My contributors make more profits
Hiring kids in Mexico
He can work in fast food
Can`t make computer games
America is going down the drains
How can a man support himself
working in a Burger King?
And don`t even start with school.
There ain`t no education going on.
A million in prison
The walls are rockin`
But they`d be out
lf they could afford Johnnie Cochran
Their equal chance
Won`t happen for sure
Time to take from the rich
And give to the poor
Those boys want a government
Small and weak
They speak for the rich
But pretend to defend the meek
''Shit.'' ''Fuck.''
''Cocksucker.''
The obscenity
Black folks live with every day
ls trying to believe a word
Politicians say
Obscenity? l`m Jay Bulworth
And l`ve come to say
The Democratic party`s
Got some shit to pay
ls gonna pay it in the ghetto
ls gonna pay it in the--
You mean Democrats don`t care
about the Afro-Amer--?
Some say there are no black
leaders because they got killed.
But l think it`s from the decimation
of urban manufacturing bases.
Guess my age.
He`s done. Flush him.
You know the guy in the booth?
The network says he`s through
For letting me talk to you
Corporations get to say
Who can talk
And who`s crazy today
Cut to commercial
lf you want a job
You may not be back
With this corporate mob
-Flush him.
-Cut.
Cut to commercial
Cut to commercial
l have a question l want to ask
This network pays you for this task
Why do they get airwaves?
They`re the people`s
They`d be worth 70 billion
To people today
lf money-grubbing Congress
Didn`t give them away
For big campaign money
lt`s hopeless, you see
lf you running for office
Without no TV
Without big money
You get a defeat
Broadcasters make you dead meat
This country says speech is free
But free do not get you
No spots on TV
lf you want senators
Not on the take
Give them free air time
They won`t have to fake
Telecommunication
ls the name of the beast that`s
Eating the world
West to east
Movies, tabloids, TVand magazines
Tell us what to think
All our hopes and dreams
The company`s out of the country
How American is that?
American families
Can`t buy a meal
Ask a brother if he`s getting a deal
A white boy busting ass
Till he`s in his grave
Ain`t gotta be black
To live like a slave
The rich stay on top by dividing white
people from colored people.
White people are more like
the colored than the rich.
-We just got to eliminate them.
-Eliminate?
-Rich people?
-White people.
Black, brown, yellow people.
Get rid of them. We need...
...a voluntary, open-ended program...
...of procreative racial
deconstruction.
Fuck till we`re all the same color.
Damn!
lt`s gonna take a while--
Thank you. We`ll return with
former Governor Lamar Alexander.
Bulworth?
You should get some sleep.
Get away.
This guy`s a hit man.
Shoot them together.
Are you shooting them both?
Get them in a two-shot.
lt isn`t worth shit without a two-shot.
Get her back over there.
Here`s the picture, right here.
You`re not getting the shot!
You`re not getting it!
She`s leaving!
-Stand here!
-Get off my case!
-l`m asking, did you get the shot?
-Of course l got it!
-You didn`t get it.
-l got it!
Wasn`t the guy.
Few days ago, l made a deal
with a guy...
...for a lot of life insurance.
And then l...
...paid a guy to hire a guy
to kill me.
l tried to cancel, but the guy
l paid is in a coma.
l can`t reach whoever he hired
to tell him the job`s off.
There`s a lesson here, which is
never make life or death decisions...
...when you`re feeling...
...suicidal, because you can`t--
Vinnie too cheap for a hit man.
l had to get you upstairs
so he could push you off the balcony.
When l didn`t get you up there,
he said to get paid...
...l would have to do it myself.
Here.
l changed my mind.
What?
So you get it?
Ain`t nobody gonna kill you.
You get it?
Jay.
Senator Bulworth,
elaborately costumed...
...made no explanation for his
more casual...
...mode of dress and behavior.
How can a man support himself
working in a Burger King?
And don`t start with school.
No education`s going on.
Obscenity? l`m a senator.
Yo, shut up.
Shut up!
lf they could afford
Johnnie Cochran....
The senator`s meeting with advisors.
Yes, l`m an advisor.
l`ll be meeting with him too.
Good morning?
Sandy, of course l know where he is.
Meeting with advisors.
Yeah. Okay, bye.
Where is he?
Attention is focused on California...
... with one day of campaigning left.
ln the senatorial race...
...Hugh Weldie began campaigning
early this morning.
His opponent, Senator Bulworth,
is with advisors.
Call it single payer or Canadian Way
Socialized medicine will save the day
Let me hear that dirty word
Socialism!
Where is Senator Bulworth?
Where is Jay Bulworth?
Where is Senator Bulworth?
With the Bulworth campaign moments
from the primary...
...it`s keeping its candidate
under wraps.
The obscenity
Black folks live with every day
ls trying to believe a word
Politicians say
Obscenity?
l`m Jay Bulworth and l`ve--
-Should we call the police?
-You think that`s the press we need?
Where is Senator Bulworth?
Where is Senator Bulworth?
Where is Senator Bulworth?
People are asking this election day...
...after the senator astonished
everyone by making no appearances.
Campaign chief Dennis Murphy said
the senator would meet...
... with the press today.
California primary night, and nobody`s
seen anything quite like it.
The surprise is Senator Bulworth.
Not only has he won the Democratic
senatorial nomination...
... with 7 1% of the vote,
he`s received 1 5%...
...of the Democratic
and 8% of the Republican vote...
...as a write-in for president.
Political analysts are bewildered...
...at this unprecedented
turn of events.
Nina`s no idiot.
lf she was hiding the senator--
What? lf she was hiding
the senator, what?
-ls he still sleeping?
-Still sleeping.
...if he is here.
Feldman? Feldman?
An unusual situation.
Hey, L.D., what`s up?
Got customers.
L.D., man, come on.
What`s up?
House looks good, Momma Doll.
They can`t see the flowers.
-The man`s in a close-up.
-They should show my flowers.
Hey, man. lt`s important that
l speak with...
...Senator Bulworth. ls he here?
Wait in the street.
l can`t wait in the street.
l`m very cool. l`m the senator`s
chief of staff.
And don`t mess up the flowers.
Some sort of powwow at the door.
Maybe we can get information.
Will the senator make a statement?
Very shortly, l promise.
Missy Berliner.
This is contempt for the press.
He`s been missing for two days.
Do we call Robert Stack?
ls he in there?
-We got a problem.
-He still sleeping?
Bulworth Democrats agree on one thing:
Leading is more important
than winning.
Sit tight.
-What`s up, L.D.?
-He owes me money.
-You`ll get it.
-l don`t want it.
-What?
-He don`t want it.
Look at me.
Look at me, brother.
You`ll work it off.
Work it off? Doing what?
Things need to be done in the `hood.
You`re gonna help me do them.
lf you don`t help me do them--
Come here.
l got a reputation to protect,
so you have to wear these.
lf you help me, you wear these
casts without breaking your legs.
l`m about to flip this power shit.
For the sake of your daughter,
l hope--
Hi.
Hi.
-Good sleep?
-Yes, thank you.
Good to see you.
-How are you, senator?
-Very well.
You have a very
comfortable guest room.
-Good to see you.
-You`re on TV.
May l borrow the telephone?
l think l`m late at my headquarters.
l can`t thank you enough
for your hospitality.
General, stay for supper.
We got kale.
He likes collard greens.
No, he just thinks
it`s collard greens.
